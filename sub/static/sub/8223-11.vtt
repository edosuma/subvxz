WEBVTT

00:00.820 --> 00:05.350
Please, do not try any of the experiment
you're about to see us do at home.

00:05.730 --> 00:06.510
You heard him.

00:06.720 --> 00:07.490
Don't to it!

00:10.720 --> 00:12.979
On this episode of "Mythbusters"

00:12.980 --> 00:16.170
we're taking a trip down memory Lane.

00:16.580 --> 00:19.560
In a countdown of the
host's ultimate highlights.

00:19.710 --> 00:21.690
This is hands down by favorite episode.

00:21.770 --> 00:23.540
We'll go behind the scenes.

00:23.590 --> 00:27.070
It is the beating heart behind
why we love doing this show.

00:27.120 --> 00:30.270
To salute and celebrate the greatest hit,

00:30.480 --> 00:36.230
most spectacular misses, trickiest
builds and weirdest, wackiest,

00:36.300 --> 00:38.390
most exciting experiments.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.210
It was hilarious.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.090
So buckle up,

00:42.240 --> 00:44.990
count down and hold onto your stomachs

00:45.080 --> 00:49.650
because this is the
Mythbusters top 25 special.

00:49.860 --> 00:52.290
Holy crap, I'm gonna die.

00:55.050 --> 00:56.710
Who are the Mythbusters?

00:56.960 --> 00:57.910
Adam Savage.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.300
It's scientific!

00:59.600 --> 01:00.860
And Jamie Hyneman.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.710
I call him my Little Pop Gun.

01:02.860 --> 01:06.690
Between them, more than 30 years
of special effects experience.

01:07.730 --> 01:10.450
Joining them, Tory Belleci.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.940
And touchdown.

01:12.010 --> 01:12.950
Kari Byron...

01:13.010 --> 01:15.930
- I was starting to get a little crazy.
- And Grant Imahara.

01:16.130 --> 01:17.920
That was awesome!

01:18.060 --> 01:19.780
They don't just tell the myths.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.240
They put them to the test.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074

01:36.070 --> 01:37.960
Three, two

01:47.190 --> 01:48.190
Mythbusters.

01:48.430 --> 01:48.930
Okay.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.040
I'll assemble the team.

02:11.009 --> 02:11.510
I got the call.

02:11.570 --> 02:12.440
What's the emergency?

02:12.510 --> 02:13.090
I don't know.

02:13.130 --> 02:14.110
Where's the walrus?

02:14.920 --> 02:15.770
Good morning, team.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.110
Thanks for assembling.

02:17.111 --> 02:20.099
The network has asked to
us make a two hour special,

02:20.100 --> 02:23.179
the top 25 Mythbuster moments.

02:23.180 --> 02:24.940
I'm sorry, this is distracting me.

02:25.650 --> 02:27.500
Seriously, we're compiling

02:27.610 --> 02:30.130
our all-time favorite
"Mythbusters" episodes.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.560
I've got a few.

02:31.740 --> 02:33.470
This is going to be totally awesome.

02:33.540 --> 02:35.400
What are you guys standing around for?

02:35.430 --> 02:36.310
Let's get started.

02:40.830 --> 02:44.290
Narrator: So we're all set to
launch the top 25 countdown.

02:45.860 --> 02:49.410
And it's going to be a wild
ride full of spectacles,

02:49.630 --> 02:51.610
science and intrigue,

02:51.670 --> 02:54.690
insight into the hosts'
personal highlights.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.480
Not to mention all those
fan favorites you love

02:57.520 --> 03:01.250
to see again and again and again.

03:02.420 --> 03:03.160
So where do we begin?

03:03.170 --> 03:04.020
What do we ge?

03:04.870 --> 03:07.100
In at 25, the first most

03:07.150 --> 03:11.660
memorable Mythbusters moment,
in fact, the first-ever myth.

03:12.240 --> 03:17.160
Yep, way back when Adam looked
16 and Jamie looked like Janie,

03:17.870 --> 03:21.900
our dynamic duo took on the
myth of the jato rocket car.

03:22.190 --> 03:24.340
And to test it they built their own

03:24.460 --> 03:27.840
jet assisted takeoff rocket,
attached them to a car.

03:28.190 --> 03:29.620
Yee haw!

03:30.440 --> 03:33.210
And hit the desert with mayhem in mind.

03:33.310 --> 03:34.940
I'm going to have to have a cranectomy.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.510
It's funny that after all these episodes

03:38.570 --> 03:41.740
the jato rocket car
is still a fan favorite

03:41.800 --> 03:44.860
and a high point for me and Jamie.

03:45.740 --> 03:46.810
Brakes are coming off.

03:47.620 --> 03:48.510
We are go.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.830
Sitting in that chopper
watching the rocket car take off

03:52.240 --> 03:55.970
red line, coming out of full throttle.

03:56.180 --> 03:57.820
Coming off of the electronics.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.680
It was just, it was just extraordinary.

04:01.510 --> 04:02.990
Go ahead, set him off!

04:03.310 --> 04:08.370
Firing in three, two, one, fire!

04:11.150 --> 04:14.430
Three, two, one, firing.

04:15.010 --> 04:17.860
Three, two, one, firing.

04:18.940 --> 04:20.050
We got them all.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.480
I mean the closest
example I can give to it is

04:26.540 --> 04:29.880
that it was like watching
some sort of African animal

04:29.930 --> 04:32.500
take off really quickly
across the Savanah.

04:36.570 --> 04:39.400
Except this was a car with a rocket on it.

04:40.290 --> 04:41.500
I mean it was beautiful.

04:41.590 --> 04:42.300
It was gorgeous.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.230
And a classic Mythbuster moment.

04:46.570 --> 04:47.940
That was hysterical.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.190
That was absolutely outrageous.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.820
A hit of the absurd,

04:52.020 --> 04:56.830
dash of engineering and a side
salad of busted urban myth.

04:59.610 --> 05:00.710
That was beautiful.

05:02.860 --> 05:05.460
From a single soaring moment in the mojave

05:05.540 --> 05:09.500
to a whole lot of locking and
loading, responsibly, of course.

05:11.020 --> 05:11.770
Do it.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.450
Guns are a part of our standard
stock in trade on this show.

05:21.510 --> 05:23.610
I've got to say I have some reservations

05:23.660 --> 05:25.180
about that because, well,

05:25.620 --> 05:27.710
they kill people and that's to be avoided.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.380
But that being said,

05:29.470 --> 05:33.690
they're often fascinating
elegantly engineered machines

05:33.750 --> 05:36.820
that in our hands, where
we use materials and tools

05:36.870 --> 05:38.820
in ways for which they
were never intended.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.590
I call it my Little Pop Gun.

05:41.060 --> 05:43.170
Things get real interesting real fast.

05:44.430 --> 05:45.610
It's a lot of fun.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.980
You're looking at a vegetarian.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.030
Hey, nice shot.

05:55.490 --> 05:56.440
From California.

05:56.580 --> 05:57.700
Let her have at it, Kari.

05:58.890 --> 06:02.580
I never expected I would be a gun person.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.640
Until I joined Mythbusters.

06:12.190 --> 06:14.960
Narrator: Guns and ammo are
part of the Mythbuster tradition,

06:15.150 --> 06:17.410
but that relationship is built on respect

06:17.590 --> 06:20.410
and an ultra safe environment created

06:20.460 --> 06:23.730
by expert armorers and
law enforcement officials.

06:24.260 --> 06:27.530
If you see anything unsafe, please
report it to the rangemaster.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.190
But the moment that fires guns

06:34.230 --> 06:37.190
and ammo number number
24 is from the viewer

06:37.230 --> 06:38.980
requested myth that it was

06:39.020 --> 06:42.540
possible to cut down a
tree with a machine gun.

06:44.100 --> 06:47.170
After Tory and grant
failed with the small arms,

06:47.310 --> 06:52.000
our vegetarian, tree hugging
hippie stepped it up to ramp it up.

06:52.730 --> 06:54.340
One of my favorite moments

06:54.410 --> 06:58.500
was shooting a gatling
gun to mow down a tree.

06:58.570 --> 06:59.670
We're going hot.

07:00.390 --> 07:04.000
I had never shot anything
this crazy before.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.990
In three, two, one.

07:10.140 --> 07:12.450
We're talking 30 caliber bullets.

07:12.610 --> 07:14.780
3,000 rounds per minute.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.500
Just ach, ach, ach.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.810
It was powerful.

07:32.550 --> 07:33.730
I think a lot of people

07:33.750 --> 07:35.890
would have liked to be
in my shoes that day.

07:37.770 --> 07:41.379
From guns and ammo to a
weapon of mass.. deduction.

07:41.380 --> 07:44.150
Wake up, time for science.

07:45.780 --> 07:48.350
I know that a lot of our viewers tune

07:48.360 --> 07:49.980
in because we blow a lot of crap up.

07:53.290 --> 07:54.730
And make no mistake, that is fun,

07:54.860 --> 07:56.460
but for us what's kept it fun,

07:56.530 --> 08:00.330
the show entertaining for all
these years is the science.

08:00.380 --> 08:03.820
Gravity, man, it's not just
a good idea, it's the law.

08:03.870 --> 08:08.160
It is the beating heart behind
why we love doing this show.

08:11.390 --> 08:12.910
It's scientific.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.220
And the tall tale

08:16.280 --> 08:20.660
that provides the fondest memory
of solid scientific methodology

08:20.920 --> 08:25.940
and makes it in at number 23
is the time the team fired up.

08:28.130 --> 08:31.069
The myth was that a bullet
fired straight into the air will

08:31.070 --> 08:32.780
kill when you it comes
back into the ground.

08:32.780 --> 08:36.210
All we did was found a lake
bed that was pretty pristine.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.940
Fire the bullets up, see where they land.

08:40.289 --> 08:41.200
Simple, right?

08:41.710 --> 08:43.429
Sometimes the best science is simple.

08:45.990 --> 08:48.150
The U.S. Military had actually done
a fair amount of research into it

08:48.200 --> 08:49.520
in between the two wars,

08:49.910 --> 08:52.000
they wanted to know what
happened with falling bullets.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.610
There she blows, that's
a 9 millimeter round.

08:59.150 --> 08:59.940
We found it.

09:00.580 --> 09:04.090
We looked at all their research
and by the end of our episode,

09:04.230 --> 09:06.250
we effectively tripled,

09:06.300 --> 09:08.290
I think, the amount of
real practical knowledge

09:08.330 --> 09:11.110
there is about bullets, how they fall,

09:11.190 --> 09:12.208
what speed they fall at

09:12.209 --> 09:14.200
and what they'll do to
you once they hit you.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.210
About two inches.

09:18.420 --> 09:20.370
I would say that's probably
one of the few episodes we could

09:20.390 --> 09:22.580
publish the results from
and I'm really proud of that.

09:23.590 --> 09:25.980
This is science in action.

09:28.180 --> 09:31.700
The next most memorable... most memorable.

09:32.690 --> 09:36.120
The next most memorable mythbudgeter.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.360
This doesn't happen to me.

09:38.420 --> 09:39.470
Usually happens to Jamie.

09:39.950 --> 09:45.040
Am I actually failing as trying
to say failure is always an option,

09:45.430 --> 09:47.670
Can we just roll the tape.

09:48.900 --> 09:52.790
To say that things go wrong on
the show is an understatement.

09:52.870 --> 09:53.860
Fire in the hole.

09:54.370 --> 09:57.840
And fabulous failures stick
in the memory include...

09:58.270 --> 09:59.070
Go!

10:01.070 --> 10:04.400
This bunker test of the myth
of the confederate rocket

10:04.570 --> 10:07.910
which put an end to
shot-bound tests with rockets.

10:08.270 --> 10:11.950
I heard that go...

10:13.570 --> 10:15.830
then there was compact compact.

10:17.460 --> 10:18.570
And the revisit,

10:18.810 --> 10:20.410
whether the run away trucks...

10:20.520 --> 10:22.770
They're going to go in the water.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.630
Let to some subtextual brainstorming.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.525
The weakest link in this
chain was breakaway ropes.

10:28.526 --> 10:30.355
And that's what we wanted it to be.

10:31.100 --> 10:34.070
But to get in the top 25
most memorable moments'

10:34.120 --> 10:36.730
list, it's got to be an epic.

10:37.470 --> 10:43.500
I think the most epic failure
of all time was the jato rocket

10:43.630 --> 10:50.300
revisit when there was so much
planning and so much work going

10:50.360 --> 10:54.030
into getting this car to go up a ramp

10:54.100 --> 10:58.140
using jato rockets and
it blew up on the ramp.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.710
Three, two, one, go!

11:03.080 --> 11:04.060
Good it's on the hook.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.740
It's moving well.

11:06.090 --> 11:07.020
Here it goes.

11:07.310 --> 11:08.410
Go heading toward the ramp.

11:14.700 --> 11:15.650
Or not!

11:15.840 --> 11:17.150
There's no reset.

11:17.260 --> 11:21.860
You can't reset for a jato
rocket car launch because

11:21.900 --> 11:24.670
blowing up is your last chance.

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
Boom, done.

11:25.950 --> 11:26.800
No reset.

11:32.190 --> 11:33.480
What was that?

11:33.600 --> 11:35.410
That was one thing I didn't expect.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.100
Total explosion upon ignition.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.060
But what's really interesting
about the mythbusting motto.

11:42.380 --> 11:44.990
Failure is always an option.

11:45.630 --> 11:48.620
Isn't the accidents, mishaps and chaos,

11:48.750 --> 11:50.070
it's the science.

11:51.400 --> 11:55.420
Failure is always an option I
came up with and put on early

11:55.470 --> 11:58.350
crew hats as a Christmas
gift early in the show.

11:58.560 --> 11:59.900
It's not just a joke.

12:01.770 --> 12:04.230
It's actually really the
cornerstone of our approach to

12:04.280 --> 12:05.510
the scientific method.

12:05.630 --> 12:06.830
Any result's a result.

12:06.900 --> 12:07.790
That's for sure.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.220
We screw things up all
the time on this show.

12:15.150 --> 12:18.270
And we have no pretense
that we don't screw up.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.400
Whoops.

12:20.260 --> 12:22.690
In fact, when we fail, we learn things.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.500
So we actually kind of respect it.

12:33.770 --> 12:36.900
That was the scariest thing
I've ever done on this show.

12:37.380 --> 12:38.900
That was terrifying.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.330
The car is going. The car
is going! There it goes.

12:43.110 --> 12:45.230
Cultural idea of the scientific is someone

12:45.290 --> 12:46.490
who sets an experiment and when it

12:46.540 --> 12:48.046
doesn't happen the way it

12:48.047 --> 12:50.940
happened they say oh my
experiment is a failure.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.120
No scientist actually thinks like that.

12:54.310 --> 12:57.580
Any experiment that yields
data is a viable experiment.

12:58.150 --> 13:03.220
Is information.

13:03.380 --> 13:05.480
Therefore any kind of failure of

13:05.520 --> 13:08.460
what we perceive might
happen is an option.

13:13.530 --> 13:16.810
Up next on the Mythbusters top 25 special,

13:19.080 --> 13:22.160
nothing beats your first "world first. "

13:32.840 --> 13:34.880
I had a nightmare like this once.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.950
The glass break episode
is our first "world first"

13:39.030 --> 13:40.770
and it's a real high point for us.

13:48.980 --> 13:50.130
I did it!

13:51.070 --> 13:51.900
Going into that episode,

13:51.960 --> 13:53.690
everyone heard the myth
that an opera singer

13:53.700 --> 13:54.809
could shatter a glass with their voice

13:54.810 --> 13:56.480
and we thought that that
was totally possible.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.269
But our research started to turn

14:01.270 --> 14:04.180
it over and show that it
was maybe not possible.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.610
That nobody had ever
filmed anybody doing it.

14:08.530 --> 14:10.520
That there were films
of a speaker doing it,

14:10.830 --> 14:13.500
but never someone solely with their voice.

14:23.110 --> 14:24.860
Dude!

14:25.590 --> 14:27.970
That is a first on television!

14:28.100 --> 14:32.040
Honestly, this is one of my
favorite high speed shots.

14:32.230 --> 14:35.650
Seeing there, watching
the glass vibrate back

14:35.720 --> 14:37.670
and forth and watching
his voice and watching

14:37.750 --> 14:40.530
the glass shatter
catastrophically as it totally

14:40.610 --> 14:44.910
fails watching Jamie
about six years later,

14:45.010 --> 14:47.350
pulling his lips away
from the shattering glass,

14:47.490 --> 14:49.560
showing the real difference between action

14:49.610 --> 14:51.950
and reaction when you slow things down

14:52.510 --> 14:53.920
it doesn't get much better than that.

14:54.330 --> 14:58.240
But apparently some viewers
weren't as happy as our hosts.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.620
After the story aired
we got a lot of feedback

15:00.680 --> 15:03.320
from people indicating we
weren't able to actually

15:03.390 --> 15:06.270
able to break that
glass with a human voice.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.830
Yep, some of you thought
this microphone boom

15:09.900 --> 15:14.540
is a sonic gun and that this
lens flair is a fishing line.

15:15.370 --> 15:19.060
Both theory suggesting that
the glass break was fake.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.600
We like controversial results

15:21.660 --> 15:24.590
from our testing, we also like

15:24.650 --> 15:26.750
it when people criticize what

15:26.800 --> 15:28.100
we've done on the show because

15:28.570 --> 15:29.990
it means that they're thinking

15:30.050 --> 15:33.830
about what we've done and you
know, that's where it's all at.

15:33.890 --> 15:37.530
If you're thinking about the
show, then you're being engaged

15:37.610 --> 15:38.820
and we're doing our job.

15:39.710 --> 15:42.330
Next up is not so much a single moment

15:42.430 --> 15:45.090
but a medley of mean machines.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.352
Over the year, the team

15:51.353 --> 15:53.900
has collected plenty
of crazy contraptions,

15:54.830 --> 15:57.390
mad models and rad robots.

15:58.260 --> 16:00.450
This is exactly what's going to happen.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.400
That's what's going to happen.

16:05.190 --> 16:07.300
These beastly builds have provided

16:07.350 --> 16:09.790
many of the team's all-time highs.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.700
Watch out!

16:15.470 --> 16:18.680
And although this moment is
a monumental to them all...

16:20.940 --> 16:21.880
pretty sexy, huh.

16:22.090 --> 16:25.400
The hosts do have a
few cherished examples.

16:25.930 --> 16:28.330
For both Adam and I
building crazy machines...

16:28.390 --> 16:30.330
well, it's what we live for.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.180
Like that.

16:33.230 --> 16:35.310
Just a godly torrent of water.

16:35.630 --> 16:37.420
But out of all of them,

16:37.550 --> 16:39.760
what would be my favorite or the craziest?

16:41.870 --> 16:44.860
Working on these machines
is great for my skin!

16:44.950 --> 16:47.730
I would say that would have
to be the steam machine gun.

16:50.920 --> 16:55.280
Nice! Very pleased. And terrified.

16:55.410 --> 16:58.010
I mean this thing was
just so out of control,

16:58.090 --> 17:02.020
we had these pressure
vessels that are hissing

17:02.350 --> 17:05.130
that you turn the thing on and
all these steam motors start

17:05.170 --> 17:07.000
to spin things at high speeds.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.150
Three, two, one.

17:09.089 --> 17:11.349
It was terrifying to even be close to it.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.930
It was insane.

17:19.130 --> 17:21.000
As for master modeler Tory,

17:21.160 --> 17:23.979
whenever he gets to bring
his special effects experience

17:23.980 --> 17:26.490
to the party, he couldn't be happier.

17:28.780 --> 17:31.420
I mean who gets to build
a 20-foot rubber shark?

17:33.050 --> 17:35.140
Or a batmobile our a trans am?

17:37.050 --> 17:38.200
What do you think of the car?

17:38.540 --> 17:39.340
Cool.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.040
I'm like the luckiest guy in the world.

17:45.910 --> 17:47.770
And grant, that's easy.

17:47.930 --> 17:51.199
He's the one with the
army of robot minions.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.640
He's alive, alive!

17:55.020 --> 17:57.970
I think that building these machines

17:58.200 --> 18:00.080
is one of my favorite things on the show.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.410
Decapitation happens, everybody.

18:06.340 --> 18:07.710
One of my hobbies before

18:07.900 --> 18:10.730
starting Mythbusters was fighting robots.

18:11.430 --> 18:13.118
That if you build a robot,

18:13.119 --> 18:15.780
it fights other robots inside this arena.

18:15.930 --> 18:21.620
The machines I built for
Mythbusters are an extension of that.

18:23.490 --> 18:24.890
I didn't train him to do that.

18:24.970 --> 18:25.930
Grant always says he knows

18:25.990 --> 18:29.290
when he's built a
really, really good robot.

18:29.390 --> 18:32.140
When just before you set it off.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.590
Even though everybody
is behind blast shields,

18:34.640 --> 18:36.430
in a bunker, far, far away.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.750
Everyone on the crew,

18:37.850 --> 18:40.480
including yourself takes
a little half step back.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.480
All right, here we go.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.720
In three, two one?

18:49.550 --> 18:53.070
In the serious business of
solving crimes of science...

18:53.610 --> 18:55.030
cue dramatic music.

18:55.290 --> 18:58.050
Sometimes you need a little borough text.

19:00.790 --> 19:02.960
Yeah, I can shake a booty in this.

19:04.770 --> 19:05.620
Come on, let's go.

19:05.670 --> 19:07.100
I feel like I'm ready to go out clubbing.

19:09.190 --> 19:10.990
It's not dissimilar to
how Jamie was dressed

19:11.020 --> 19:12.590
when he first came to earth.

19:13.070 --> 19:13.946
You want to take off your

19:13.947 --> 19:15.420
hood and participate in this conversation.

19:15.590 --> 19:16.270
I kind of like it in here.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.570
It's private.

19:18.380 --> 19:21.250
Hail people of earth, I come in peace.

19:21.710 --> 19:24.390
Yep the team often put
on protective clothing.

19:24.670 --> 19:27.470
In their line of work it
would be foolish not to.

19:29.540 --> 19:30.740
Oh, dude.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.590
But over the years at your urging,

19:33.720 --> 19:37.520
they have also worn costumes
that are not strictly necessary.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.380
And this fan requested costume comedy

19:43.510 --> 19:45.440
and creative use of safety gear

19:45.590 --> 19:48.590
has provided a host audience highlights.

19:48.710 --> 19:52.010
So let's take a moment to
remember all those moments

19:52.070 --> 19:53.426
when the team took one

19:53.427 --> 19:56.140
for the team and got
dressed up like idiots.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.900
James, I'm frightened.

19:59.790 --> 20:02.160
You have right to be afraid, my lovely.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.220
How do you feel?

20:06.590 --> 20:07.660
I feel kind of sexy.

20:07.770 --> 20:10.860
We're definitely firmer at
8,000 feet but not by much.

20:11.020 --> 20:12.350
Do you want to go all the way?

20:12.510 --> 20:14.810
Yes, yes!

20:15.150 --> 20:16.250
Let's get out of here.

20:18.390 --> 20:20.160
Are you ready?

20:20.260 --> 20:22.640
This is as disturbing as I think it is.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.940
It's even more disturbing
than you think it is.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.000
- I like it.
- Sir, yes, sir!

20:30.680 --> 20:37.750
I predict they'll all be dancing
on Jamie's intestines in minutes.

20:38.020 --> 20:40.910
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

20:43.370 --> 20:44.300
Good job, dude.

20:44.380 --> 20:46.460
Once again, making my family proud.

20:56.090 --> 21:01.140
Number 18 is a watery fable
that proves science saves lives.

21:02.910 --> 21:05.510
While we've tested stories
that range the gamut,

21:05.550 --> 21:08.750
everything from the purely
abstract physics experiments,

21:08.850 --> 21:12.730
conceptual ideas to Hollywood
misconceptions about physics.

21:14.890 --> 21:15.730
Golly.

21:15.800 --> 21:16.530
Every now and then,

21:16.560 --> 21:17.530
we get our hands on something

21:17.580 --> 21:19.910
that has real world
consequence and for me,

21:19.970 --> 21:22.520
the high point for that
is the underwater car.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.160
The myth being that if this happened,

21:27.510 --> 21:29.840
you wouldn't be able to
open the door to escape

21:30.070 --> 21:32.850
until the interior filled with water.

21:34.610 --> 21:35.820
So cue the car.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.521
I had to remove the engine

21:39.522 --> 21:42.560
from the car to clean the car up so I did.

21:43.850 --> 21:45.770
- The water...
- Don't pee in the pool.

21:45.870 --> 21:48.820
Offered Adam the
opportunity of a lifetime.

21:49.250 --> 21:50.890
This is something I've
always wanted to do.

21:50.980 --> 21:52.650
This is my story from the get-go,

21:52.720 --> 21:56.180
Ok, it's coming faster my way. Now I
can start seeing the end of the water.

21:56.780 --> 22:01.400
That being said, being in in that car
while it was sinking, being buckled in,

22:01.490 --> 22:06.690
feeling the cabin of the car pressurizing,

22:06.790 --> 22:08.800
all of those things are totally wrong.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.379
And you know, you're clear

22:10.380 --> 22:12.760
that if you ever felt these in real life,

22:12.810 --> 22:15.870
things would have been
going very, very badly.

22:17.760 --> 22:21.560
All of that being said it was
still a super high point for me.

22:21.620 --> 22:23.720
I always wanted to be the
hero of my own action movie

22:23.770 --> 22:25.460
and this is one of the chances.

22:26.450 --> 22:27.890
This is confirmed.

22:27.960 --> 22:31.450
I could not open that door until the cab

22:31.500 --> 22:34.330
seemed to be full of water for a while.

22:34.970 --> 22:38.110
So Adam got to live
out his stuntman dreams.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.501
But what make this myth

22:40.502 --> 22:43.170
remarkable is that they didn't stop there.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.959
Adam and Jamie went on to test variable

22:45.960 --> 22:48.100
escape techniques that would work.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.070
Freedom!

22:51.680 --> 22:56.200
One of which made Adam and
Jamie real-life lifesavers.

22:56.260 --> 22:58.780
About six months after our
water car aired, I got an e-mail

22:58.830 --> 23:00.720
from a fan who was a truck driver,

23:00.721 --> 23:02.500
had been driving, had a seizure,

23:02.560 --> 23:06.840
passed out, woke up having
driven his truck in the water.

23:06.960 --> 23:09.190
He woke up with his cab under water

23:09.390 --> 23:11.560
and he tried opening the
door and it wouldn't open.

23:11.660 --> 23:15.470
Remembered our episode and he...

23:15.770 --> 23:17.050
I still can't believe he did this,

23:17.100 --> 23:19.760
he reached up to the roof's cabin
and opened the air vent on the roof

23:19.800 --> 23:24.700
and let his truck fill up with water.
This is nighttime, he can't see anything.

23:24.970 --> 23:28.260
He held his breath, then he
opened the door and swam to safety.

23:32.180 --> 23:32.960
My hat is off to him.

23:32.980 --> 23:34.310
That blew all of our minds.

23:36.360 --> 23:43.090
Incredibly, the hosts'
stomach churning antics

23:43.150 --> 23:45.610
have worked their way
into your affections.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.290
Is anybody ready for diving?

23:52.490 --> 23:53.630
Well, that's great.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.160
Smells like pizza.

23:55.570 --> 23:56.930
I'm done with science for today.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.570
So once again for your viewing pleasure,

24:00.870 --> 24:10.510
we bring you green grant,
queasy Kari, and seasick Adam.

24:10.930 --> 24:12.933
I've been seasick all over the world,

24:12.934 --> 24:14.450
I've been seasick in Africa.

24:14.730 --> 24:16.050
Adam is doing his best to

24:16.110 --> 24:18.270
help us attract more sharks.

24:22.350 --> 24:24.200
I've been seasick in the pacific.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.350
I've even been seasick on a plane.

24:32.590 --> 24:33.510
Adam, you got it.

24:33.560 --> 24:37.700
You got it come on, stay
with us, stay with us.

24:38.490 --> 24:39.780
We got it, come back.

24:42.910 --> 24:43.540
Are you with me?

24:43.590 --> 24:44.100
I'm with you.

24:44.120 --> 24:45.910
I passed out for a few seconds.

24:45.980 --> 24:47.430
I had will say of all the times

24:47.480 --> 24:49.370
I have been sick, the blue

24:49.420 --> 24:51.790
angels flight was the only time

24:51.840 --> 24:54.050
being sick did not film diminish

24:54.090 --> 24:57.090
in any way from what I was experiencing.

24:57.310 --> 24:58.880
I'm starting to feel a little nauseous.

24:58.960 --> 24:59.910
I may throw up.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.780
All right, you got the
bags back there? I do.

25:01.910 --> 25:02.720
Hold on.

25:05.720 --> 25:09.770
I mean I threw up, I think I
filled seven barf bags on those

25:09.820 --> 25:11.290
three flights that I took.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.990
And I still had a fantastic time

25:15.040 --> 25:17.910
and I would do it again
tomorrow, if I could.

25:19.060 --> 25:19.870
There we go.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.130
Do you know what this is?

25:21.460 --> 25:22.580
Of course you know what this is.

25:22.640 --> 25:25.890
It's a vomit bucket given
to me by the producers.

25:26.010 --> 25:28.930
Just think when you
vomit, the test is over.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.920
The reason you know what it is

25:33.930 --> 25:38.700
is because they enjoy showing
that footage over and over again.

25:38.830 --> 25:39.880
All right, let's stop.

25:39.930 --> 25:42.310
You want to like smash out a big...

25:43.130 --> 25:45.240
You see that's how it works in the show.

25:48.550 --> 25:51.790
They find out what your
weakness is... that sucked.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.350
If and they keep exploiting it.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.700
They push it like a little button.

25:57.910 --> 25:59.270
There's a bucket in front of you.

26:00.640 --> 26:01.790
You don't like meat...

26:05.390 --> 26:06.060
come on.

26:06.110 --> 26:07.750
Never leave your position, Kari.

26:08.650 --> 26:09.300
Guess what?

26:09.340 --> 26:10.700
You're going to be getting the meat.

26:10.870 --> 26:11.930
Of course I'm the one they pick up

26:11.990 --> 26:13.660
when there's anything nasty to pick up.

26:13.790 --> 26:16.380
You get seasick, you get
motion sick, guess what?

26:16.430 --> 26:18.920
You're going to be the
one throwing up on camera.

26:20.510 --> 26:23.050
Attaboy.

26:23.810 --> 26:24.810
That's what they do.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.920
Totally puked.

26:29.420 --> 26:31.840
I think I could throw
up my lunch right now.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.240
Up next, the team celebrates,

26:35.320 --> 26:40.470
collects and pontificates on
results that defy expectation.

26:42.490 --> 26:43.930
My favorite part of the show is

26:43.970 --> 26:45.227
when you expect one thing

26:45.228 --> 26:47.540
to happen and then the
exact opposite happens.

26:47.590 --> 26:50.320
His stomach is inside his helmet.

26:50.370 --> 26:53.280
It never ceases to amaze
me we start on a story

26:53.320 --> 26:55.240
that we think is going to turn out one way

26:55.470 --> 26:58.060
and we get a totally unexpected result.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.840
Take the mice versus elephant story.

27:03.700 --> 27:06.480
Amazing the elephant
totally avoids the mouse.

27:06.870 --> 27:08.930
The tire of death.

27:15.190 --> 27:18.060
You tr just goes to show you
should never assume something,

27:18.270 --> 27:20.590
you need to actually test it.

27:21.130 --> 27:23.050
There is a golf-ball like effect.

27:23.670 --> 27:25.280
That's the coolest thing ever.

27:25.330 --> 27:27.580
I can't even describe how thrilling it is,

27:27.640 --> 27:30.230
but the best work for it honestly

27:30.280 --> 27:31.490
and this is is going to
sound I can a trope,

27:31.530 --> 27:32.670
it it's scientific.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.430
You can in fact Polish a poop.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.540
That's what science about

27:36.541 --> 27:38.750
and we it also all the time on the show.

27:38.850 --> 27:42.070
The perfect example was
a bull in a China shop.

27:43.540 --> 27:44.684
You've heard this expression

27:44.685 --> 27:46.320
your whole life, a bull in a kline show.

27:46.370 --> 27:49.330
It means a really glumsy
person breaking things.

27:49.590 --> 27:51.480
Did it hurt the bull?

27:52.270 --> 27:55.620
We set up this rickety shelved China shop

27:55.670 --> 27:58.590
with all these dishes in this bull pen.

27:58.980 --> 28:01.650
This one looks like it's
ready to go without the bull.

28:01.730 --> 28:04.900
We let one bull n for
us, it was just a laugh.

28:08.030 --> 28:09.130
Here comes the bull.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.540
Look, he's totally avoiding all the China.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.680
It was the most graceful
thing I he had ever seen

28:13.760 --> 28:14.861
and it was running fast

28:14.862 --> 28:16.920
t wasn't just walking,
it was moving quick.

28:16.990 --> 28:20.210
Weaving in and out of these
shelves not even touching it.

28:20.720 --> 28:23.280
Getting rite through the shelves

28:23.320 --> 28:24.870
without knocking over a single piece.

28:24.910 --> 28:26.230
- That was cool.
- Okay.

28:26.260 --> 28:27.270
That's strange.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.970
Let's let two bulls in.

28:29.270 --> 28:33.370
One follows the other one and
they just go around the China shop.

28:33.440 --> 28:34.540
Look at.

28:34.870 --> 28:37.960
That they're very
careful of breaking China.

28:39.740 --> 28:41.540
I was elated when I found out the bulls

28:41.570 --> 28:42.700
weren't going to break anything.

28:42.750 --> 28:44.600
It was just so counterintuitive.

28:44.650 --> 28:48.670
They're big giant lump berg beast, but no,

28:48.760 --> 28:52.020
they're ballet dancers, they're
the ballet dancers of the wild.

28:52.170 --> 28:54.780
We have to admit it, it's a stupid thing,

28:54.830 --> 28:56.400
I'm never going use it again.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.030
Bull in the China shop busted.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.970
It's busted.

29:02.260 --> 29:03.260
After the break,

29:03.350 --> 29:07.080
the countdown continues with
another trio of hard hitting

29:07.160 --> 29:08.680
nice work, Buster.

29:08.760 --> 29:13.310
Absurdly satisfying, weird
and wonderful host highlights.

29:13.350 --> 29:15.130
This part might be a little gross.

29:30.210 --> 29:31.280
We should call him Buster.

29:31.830 --> 29:33.920
Buster sounds pretty good.

29:38.380 --> 29:40.340
Yep, rocketing into the countdown,

29:40.430 --> 29:43.230
it's the dummy who
who's taken not just one,

29:43.390 --> 29:45.110
but dozens for the team.

29:47.660 --> 29:51.630
Thing about Buster, you do
really think of him as a person.

29:51.710 --> 29:53.850
I mean as a character.

29:56.060 --> 29:57.180
His head's gone.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.310
The most fun thing working about
Buster is watching him bounce.

30:04.380 --> 30:05.876
It's watching Buster hit

30:05.877 --> 30:08.620
something and then
bounce off of that thing.

30:09.450 --> 30:14.530
You really get the potential
injury personified for you.

30:17.050 --> 30:18.680
Why didn't does everybody
think it's so mean

30:18.730 --> 30:20.650
that I like watching Buster get beat up,

30:20.710 --> 30:22.540
you guys do realize it's a doll.

30:24.440 --> 30:27.350
The best part about Buster is he will

30:27.380 --> 30:29.940
take tons of abuse and never complain.

30:30.170 --> 30:32.840
Nice work, Buster! Nice work.

30:33.110 --> 30:34.720
Mayhem, mischief,

30:34.750 --> 30:39.850
e and abuse he's suffered
in silence for science.

30:39.930 --> 30:43.020
I have to give a name to Buster's
primary skill on the show,

30:45.030 --> 30:48.620
I'd say it's first
person data acquisition.

30:49.470 --> 30:52.540
Or last person data acquisition.

30:55.230 --> 30:56.780
But if Buster thought his career

30:56.820 --> 30:59.180
in data acquisition a bit rough,

30:59.420 --> 31:02.490
his most memorable
moment really was pants.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.330
We order some exploding pants.

31:04.420 --> 31:06.420
Exploding pants, I mean
it was right up our alley.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.780
The story is these formers
were using this herbicide

31:08.960 --> 31:12.390
that was getting into this pants
and made them super flammable.

31:13.710 --> 31:15.000
We're going to blow your pants offer.

31:15.060 --> 31:16.420
To the point where that friction

31:16.470 --> 31:19.600
or heat source alone would
set their pants on fire.

31:20.700 --> 31:23.080
I loved the pants exploding episode

31:23.140 --> 31:27.080
because to me it was
quintessential myth busters.

31:27.160 --> 31:30.310
We had great small experiments,

31:30.400 --> 31:34.210
we had an historical myth and in the end,

31:34.400 --> 31:37.450
we got to blow Buster's pants up.

31:40.250 --> 31:41.600
So you want to ramp up the results.

31:41.690 --> 31:43.560
I want to see a pair of pants explode.

31:43.770 --> 31:47.630
This is a high velocity
explosive that we're using here.

31:47.700 --> 31:49.030
A specialty explosive,

31:49.620 --> 31:52.110
we expect bust tore get
a pretty interesting ride.

31:53.060 --> 31:59.570
- Three, two, one.
- Yeah!

32:00.170 --> 32:03.270
That's what I'm talking,
those are exploding pants.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.310
It was like he had been vaporized.

32:06.650 --> 32:09.410
After something like that happens,
you do feel bad for the guy.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.250
That's all that's left of his pants.

32:11.330 --> 32:14.850
As for Buster, he was
worse off than his pants.

32:15.230 --> 32:18.250
I found a finger or it
was a burnt up hot dog

32:18.300 --> 32:21.270
from an old barbecue but I kept it

32:21.340 --> 32:23.440
because I think it might
have been a part of Buster.

32:23.690 --> 32:28.200
This is truly the f time I
could not put him back together.

32:29.350 --> 32:31.800
In at number 14 is a household material

32:31.840 --> 32:36.180
that stuck in Adam and Jamie's absurd as.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.720
Relax, this won't hurt a bit.

32:41.980 --> 32:43.900
I take a certain glee in using tools

32:43.940 --> 32:46.460
and materials in ways for
which they were never intended.

32:46.540 --> 32:47.810
Fun for the whole family.

32:49.420 --> 32:50.970
Take the duct tape sailboat,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.720
it's such a common material but look

32:53.780 --> 32:55.130
what you can do with it

32:55.180 --> 32:57.710
if you set your mind to
it. It's such an adventure.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.180
That's right.

33:00.230 --> 33:03.970
You can keep your duct take
prom tux we've got a boat.

33:04.300 --> 33:08.000
It's a totally absurd object.

33:08.090 --> 33:11.520
Who would want a sailboat
made out of duct tape.

33:12.790 --> 33:14.050
Yee haw!

33:14.140 --> 33:15.870
This is actually working.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.246
I know that there are art
movements like the dadists,

33:18.247 --> 33:20.432
and the futurists, and the
cubists, and the impressionists.

33:20.840 --> 33:23.680
I think there should
have been some absurdist.

33:24.180 --> 33:30.020
Well, it's true that failure is
always an option, success is sweet.

33:30.530 --> 33:32.300
In the absurdist art movement,

33:32.370 --> 33:34.920
Jamie and I would be
card carrying members.

33:40.270 --> 33:41.960
All right, this part
might be a little gross.

33:42.670 --> 33:47.050
This next memorable moment
is a monumental to all those

33:47.120 --> 33:49.430
what the hell are we doing moments?

33:50.390 --> 33:55.250
I've made this ballistic gel
zombie doll to illustrate our point.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.510
Oh, yeah.

33:57.580 --> 33:58.840
It squeak when had I walked.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.340
Okay.

34:05.390 --> 34:06.390
I can answer that.

34:07.110 --> 34:10.500
I'm tying a pig's stomach
into a skeleton. Clamp.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.139
We are continuing having these moment

34:12.190 --> 34:15.330
where is we all just stop and
say what the hell are we doing?

34:15.389 --> 34:18.080
This is insane that's not tendon.

34:18.170 --> 34:20.230
- What is that?
- Penis.

34:22.449 --> 34:23.813
For me, it's like things

34:23.813 --> 34:26.199
that we do on this show are so outrageous.

34:26.370 --> 34:27.449
You're so in the moment,

34:27.489 --> 34:29.310
you're so focused on having it work

34:29.820 --> 34:32.350
that there's a split second
where you stop and go,

34:32.870 --> 34:34.920
this is one of the craziest
things I've ever done.

34:35.530 --> 34:36.800
What the in the hell are we doing?

34:45.190 --> 34:49.110
I climbed down a rope of human
hair to try to break out of jail.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.230
I see split ends.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.590
How is have used conditioner.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.040
There's split ends.

34:53.670 --> 34:54.600
That was so scary.

34:54.699 --> 34:58.070
For meet once that stand out are the ones

34:58.120 --> 35:00.410
I never imagined I would get to do.

35:01.890 --> 35:03.299
Like hand feeding an
okay puce okay toe puce

35:03.300 --> 35:04.420
that fell in love with me.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.170
Yeah, he's very exciting.

35:06.310 --> 35:07.600
Swimming in syrup.

35:08.880 --> 35:09.770
How cool is that.

35:09.830 --> 35:11.190
Who ever has tried that.

35:13.540 --> 35:18.690
One of the grossest ones for me
is when I was building beet man.

35:19.260 --> 35:20.850
I present to you.

35:21.310 --> 35:22.360
My creation.

35:22.910 --> 35:23.860
Beet man.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.010
Oh, I almost threw up.

35:28.070 --> 35:29.680
This goes on and on.

35:29.870 --> 35:32.450
And yet it all started right here.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.500
With my rear.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.940
Yep, way back in episode 2

35:39.670 --> 35:41.580
I come from the planet butthead,

35:42.200 --> 35:43.980
the team their h their first ever

35:44.140 --> 35:46.190
and most memorable what the hell

35:46.240 --> 35:50.990
are we doing moment while tackling
a tall tale of toilet mishap.

35:51.950 --> 35:54.800
Apparently while prone
on the airplane throne,

35:54.860 --> 35:58.470
a lady of large proportions hit the flush

35:58.520 --> 36:01.430
and the resulting suction
meant she couldn't get up.

36:01.520 --> 36:06.350
To test it safely in the shop,
Kari donated her model butt.

36:07.080 --> 36:08.640
How did you have this done?

36:08.900 --> 36:10.420
That's actually Kari's butt.

36:10.640 --> 36:15.690
This was my first real
entrance into television.

36:15.770 --> 36:16.800
I'm going take a shot.

36:16.850 --> 36:18.890
Try to hold it.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.210
In my mind I thought,
some little cable show.

36:24.290 --> 36:26.910
Come on, "Mythbusters"
nobody will see this.

36:26.990 --> 36:30.550
Now if you Google my name, the
first thing that comes up, my butt.

36:30.900 --> 36:35.080
With Kari's artificially
enlarged posterior in position,

36:35.130 --> 36:39.410
the section was suped
up, and the myth, busted.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.370
She would have one big hickey.

36:43.220 --> 36:44.230
Big butt hickey.

36:44.980 --> 36:46.470
That's going to be hard to explain.

36:46.730 --> 36:49.320
And to prove the voracity of the results,

36:49.360 --> 36:52.240
Jamie was ready to
stake Adam's butt on it.

36:52.780 --> 36:55.440
Are you ready to try the real zeal?

36:55.530 --> 36:56.230
Sure.

36:56.540 --> 37:00.480
With friends like that who needs enemas.

37:10.450 --> 37:12.140
All right, that's significant.

37:13.490 --> 37:16.970
Oh, my God. Oh, wow.

37:19.020 --> 37:21.450
That was really significant.

37:31.900 --> 37:34.400
Next up, on the countdown.

37:35.970 --> 37:37.830
Ignition sequence start.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.290
The team shot for the moon

37:40.800 --> 37:43.870
while shooting down the
conspiracy theorists.

37:45.770 --> 37:46.830
Eagle has landed.

37:46.950 --> 37:51.070
On this episode of "Mythbusters,"
was the moon landing a hoax?

37:51.850 --> 37:57.510
That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.

37:57.880 --> 37:58.530
What's that Neil?

37:58.930 --> 38:00.830
We really went to the moon.

38:00.900 --> 38:03.030
It's absolutely unreal.

38:03.450 --> 38:04.770
- Say hoax.
- Hoax!

38:05.030 --> 38:07.720
When I hear statistics
like 20% of Americans say

38:07.770 --> 38:10.250
they think the moon landing was faked.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.370
That's wacky right there.

38:12.460 --> 38:15.200
I'm glad we're on the air.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.000
It tells me we're doing
something more than

38:17.050 --> 38:18.820
just making an entertainment show,

38:19.030 --> 38:21.960
that we're actually
promoting critical thinking

38:22.020 --> 38:24.720
and that's a very valuable things,

38:24.790 --> 38:26.910
it makes us feel quite useful, honestly.

38:26.980 --> 38:28.570
What got me excited an doing this

38:28.600 --> 38:31.760
was building the miniatures and models.

38:31.850 --> 38:33.080
That's perfect.

38:33.220 --> 38:35.970
Because keep in mind that
for something like 20 years

38:36.030 --> 38:38.860
before I started on
"Mythbusters" that was mainly

38:38.920 --> 38:40.800
what I was doing so it was a real joy

38:40.850 --> 38:42.660
to be able to practice my craft again.

38:43.990 --> 38:45.590
He's standing full-on in the shadow,

38:45.650 --> 38:48.740
you would think you
wouldn't be able to see him,

38:48.790 --> 38:49.610
but he's bright as day.

38:49.660 --> 38:55.070
The cool thing is we got to
work with NASA. Oh my God.

38:55.440 --> 38:56.930
When do you get that opportunity

38:57.250 --> 38:59.570
to actually go to NASA's testing facility.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.290
It's a portable... use their equipment.

39:04.500 --> 39:07.150
In order to find out whether
or not we landed on the moon.

39:07.470 --> 39:11.300
It's just a rare opportunity
and a very memorable one.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.190
In your face, conspiracy theorists!

39:17.860 --> 39:18.860
Over the year,

39:18.910 --> 39:22.460
fishy fables have netted a heap
of highlights for the hosts.

39:24.350 --> 39:27.830
Coming up, whoa! Let's
give him a little bait.

39:32.390 --> 39:37.070
We're going to need a bigger boat.

39:41.310 --> 39:43.580
And mark number 11 in the countdown,

39:43.670 --> 39:46.040
the hosts have dived into the archives

39:46.090 --> 39:49.530
to select their favorite
shark infested adventures.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.340
Dude, I'm jumping into shark
infested waters for science.

39:56.210 --> 39:58.520
In the realm of doing
things you can't believe

39:58.570 --> 40:00.760
are actually being called your job,

40:00.850 --> 40:04.150
diving with 11 sharks on
tiger beach in the Bahamas,

40:04.210 --> 40:05.580
has to top the list.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.010
It was crazy great, really
difficult, really tiring,

40:09.060 --> 40:10.110
but insanely great.

40:10.490 --> 40:12.530
This is really fun.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.530
You know how in science fiction movies,

40:14.570 --> 40:16.100
there's a time port walk through

40:16.140 --> 40:18.720
to get to another world
or a closet that opens

40:18.760 --> 40:22.870
that to magic Cal land,
the ocean is another world.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.490
The surface of the ocean
is the portal to that world.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.950
We need protective gear just
to go there and when we get there,

40:29.020 --> 40:32.050
we're not at the top of the food chain.

40:32.440 --> 40:35.570
And for humans it's a
very freaky and scary thing

40:35.620 --> 40:37.140
to not be the top of the food chain.

40:37.950 --> 40:40.870
I'm going to come serenade
him in my wet suit, okay?

40:41.940 --> 40:45.270
Relieved that Adam's
highlight is out of the way,

40:45.590 --> 40:48.480
next is a myth masterminded by Kari

40:48.730 --> 40:50.378
while marooned in shark

40:50.379 --> 40:53.390
infested waters is it better to play dead?

40:53.450 --> 40:54.520
Here's the plan.

40:54.590 --> 40:55.840
We chum the heck out of the water,

40:55.890 --> 40:58.640
attracted as many sharks as
possible and then you two jump in.

40:58.710 --> 41:01.080
That's a bad idea.

41:01.130 --> 41:02.470
Who came up with that plan?

41:02.640 --> 41:04.910
Appetizers! I hope they like Sushi.

41:08.540 --> 41:11.010
Oh, I hope they like Italian.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.880
Oh, man, I got to give you
credit, I would never do this.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.720
This place is freaking scary.

41:24.690 --> 41:25.550
Good stuff.

41:25.620 --> 41:26.910
This sucks so bad.

41:27.380 --> 41:28.430
This sucks a lot.

41:28.610 --> 41:29.740
I don't want to do this.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.580
Why the hell are we doing this?

41:33.900 --> 41:36.680
Every fiber of your body is saying, no,

41:36.740 --> 41:38.820
this is the worst idea ever.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.300
You want a piece of me!

41:40.830 --> 41:42.830
You just overcome it and get in the water.

41:42.940 --> 41:45.410
First I'm trashing
around, he's playing dead.

41:48.700 --> 41:50.740
Oh my God!

41:50.860 --> 41:53.450
Then he starts trashing
around and I'm playing dead.

41:53.700 --> 41:54.530
Help!

41:54.580 --> 41:58.360
During the shark special
where I'm trying to play dead,

41:59.830 --> 42:01.790
while sharks are circling us.

42:02.030 --> 42:02.780
Help!

42:02.820 --> 42:04.940
It's really realistic, it's
almost like you're scared.

42:05.010 --> 42:09.740
This particular myth combines
two things I'm really afraid of.

42:09.820 --> 42:12.200
One being out in open water.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.750
And two, fish touching me.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.970
Something just touched me!

42:20.220 --> 42:21.460
I think that was a shark.

42:22.340 --> 42:23.830
Come on!

42:25.270 --> 42:26.200
Help!

42:26.290 --> 42:28.980
He was squealing like a girl.

42:29.040 --> 42:32.430
He was terrified, it was hilarious.

42:33.570 --> 42:35.120
Especially since I was
on the boat watching.

42:35.170 --> 42:36.290
Help!

42:36.520 --> 42:40.590
It was like the most primal
scream, it was like help!

42:40.660 --> 42:41.380
Help!

42:41.440 --> 42:42.300
Help!

42:42.390 --> 42:43.050
Help.

42:43.080 --> 42:43.790
Help!

42:43.830 --> 42:46.380
They're just hungry.

42:47.100 --> 42:47.910
All right.

42:47.990 --> 42:50.450
Come back in, I think we
might have confirmed this one.

42:52.630 --> 42:53.870
That was really intense.

42:55.220 --> 42:58.680
At number 18 is the
exclusive broadcast premiere

42:58.750 --> 43:00.840
of a much loved viral video.

43:04.050 --> 43:07.510
Back when the team tackled
facts about flatulence.

43:08.250 --> 43:09.460
Hey, we got one.

43:09.710 --> 43:11.550
In the interest of good taste,

43:11.790 --> 43:14.620
we left out an incendiary mini myth.

43:15.990 --> 43:19.590
I mind it amazing that one
of the most famous moments

43:19.640 --> 43:25.370
from your show has never actually
appeared on the air until now.

43:25.450 --> 43:29.550
It says something about the net
sensation that is "Mythbusters".

43:30.070 --> 43:32.490
Yet, the myth that you
can light your own flatus

43:32.550 --> 43:36.390
where you, yes, you,

43:36.520 --> 43:40.330
logged in in your millions
to watch it again and again.

43:40.890 --> 43:41.820
Oh, yeah.

43:41.930 --> 43:45.060
So sit back and hold your nose.

43:45.220 --> 43:47.050
Get that gas moving.

43:47.150 --> 43:48.570
Because in a world first,

43:48.620 --> 43:52.690
here is Adam's attempt
to eject hot air on air.

43:52.750 --> 43:55.930
I've got lighter, it
works, I've got position.

43:57.560 --> 43:58.549
And any minute now,

43:58.550 --> 44:01.100
hopefully we're going to
make television history.

44:02.040 --> 44:04.000
And it wasn't long before he piped up

44:04.050 --> 44:06.410
with a brief tune on the buttock bassoon.

44:07.800 --> 44:08.470
Got it.

44:11.030 --> 44:11.840
Big one.

44:12.390 --> 44:16.350
Finally.

44:16.440 --> 44:19.550
The high-speed camera
is the most important tool

44:19.590 --> 44:20.560
we've used on the show.

44:20.610 --> 44:23.660
We've used it to do things
like illuminate things

44:23.720 --> 44:26.990
happening in explosions far
faster than the human eye can see.

44:29.780 --> 44:33.300
We've also used it for recording
me lighting my own flatus.

44:35.560 --> 44:38.720
From the sublime to the totally trivial.

44:39.640 --> 44:40.880
Oh, God it.

44:42.110 --> 44:44.240
Except for the fact that we also know

44:44.290 --> 44:47.120
that no one else has ever
filmed a flatus being lit

44:47.150 --> 44:49.220
on fire on high-speed camera

44:50.540 --> 44:53.910
and we love being the first
at anything on this show.

44:54.970 --> 44:59.830
Coming up, the countdown hots up
as we close in on the top spot.

45:00.730 --> 45:03.410
When in doubt, c-4.

45:09.350 --> 45:12.680
This is the Mythbusters
top 25 special as chosen

45:12.720 --> 45:15.290
by the team and you the fans.

45:21.530 --> 45:22.890
Something just touched me!

45:24.740 --> 45:26.990
We've already seen a heap of highlights,

45:27.690 --> 45:29.500
but now that we're into the top ten,

45:29.750 --> 45:34.150
we're counting down to the biggest
bangs and best of the tests.

45:38.010 --> 45:40.910
And in at number 9 is a
collection of those moments

45:40.940 --> 45:47.040
the team strap in, buckle
up and jump off for science.

45:48.900 --> 45:50.420
We do all our own stunt,

45:50.600 --> 45:53.610
the only stunt double you'll ever
see on "Mythbusters" is Buster.

45:55.540 --> 45:57.770
The concept of human
Guinea pigs is something

45:57.800 --> 46:00.030
more than just what we
have printed our shirts,

46:00.070 --> 46:03.220
it's a central idea of "mythbudgeters".

46:07.380 --> 46:09.020
I always wanted to about stuntman as a kid

46:09.040 --> 46:11.910
so this job on "Mythbusters"
is kind of like a dream job.

46:14.090 --> 46:17.110
Yes, every single time the
team gets an opportunity

46:17.150 --> 46:19.400
to live out their stuntman dream,

46:19.490 --> 46:22.590
they make a deposit in a
the personal highlights bank.

46:22.630 --> 46:25.670
Water skiing behind a row
boat, that was exciting.

46:29.310 --> 46:31.020
We were curious to see

46:31.021 --> 46:34.440
whether it was actually
possible and it was.

46:37.250 --> 46:39.730
Never one to miss a chance to wrap it up.

46:40.300 --> 46:42.170
I can't believe we're going do this.

46:42.240 --> 46:44.360
Our resident action man Tory

46:44.500 --> 46:46.970
took the towing tale to the next level.

46:47.220 --> 46:49.210
That was probably one
of the coolest moments

46:49.260 --> 46:50.440
on the show for me,

46:50.500 --> 46:55.240
to be able to say you
wake-boarded behind a cruise ship.

46:55.800 --> 46:57.320
Yeah!

47:00.030 --> 47:02.240
I can't even describe to you the feeling.

47:03.160 --> 47:05.030
I mean it was just like oh!

47:05.730 --> 47:09.170
But it's not always as free and
easy as the guys make it look.

47:10.500 --> 47:14.510
Some of these adrenaline
fueled highlights are hard won.

47:14.710 --> 47:16.020
You do a lot of stunts,

47:16.090 --> 47:17.940
you would think you would
get used to it, but for me,

47:17.990 --> 47:19.180
that's not the case.

47:19.490 --> 47:21.780
It's like starting over every single time.

47:22.740 --> 47:23.934
You ever to psyche yourself

47:23.935 --> 47:25.660
into it to actually go through with it.

47:34.140 --> 47:35.700
Oftentimes what happens with a stunt

47:35.730 --> 47:38.020
is I will anticipate it with excitement

47:38.070 --> 47:39.900
until just before I'm about to do it

47:39.940 --> 47:42.470
then I'll realize how scary it is.

47:43.920 --> 47:47.600
And then get that fear under
control to do the thing.

47:48.850 --> 47:51.290
And slowly get better and better as I go

47:51.340 --> 47:53.230
and that is a really interesting process,

47:53.280 --> 47:56.960
overcoming that fear reflex
to be able to do something.

47:59.380 --> 48:00.440
Let's go for it.

48:00.590 --> 48:02.120
Because one of the things about the stunts

48:02.150 --> 48:03.445
that's fascinating is all

48:03.446 --> 48:05.570
the work happens before you do the stunt.

48:05.780 --> 48:07.830
There's no correcting in
the middle of the stunt

48:07.890 --> 48:10.030
which is something I've
learned the hard way.

48:10.650 --> 48:12.660
You have to be just mentally prepared

48:12.730 --> 48:15.370
so that once you take
the jump or dive or slide,

48:15.440 --> 48:16.570
it all happens right.

48:19.350 --> 48:22.960
And attaining that sensitivity
to it is really awesome.

48:29.450 --> 48:31.260
This next moment Marx the myth

48:31.300 --> 48:37.100
where iconic high-speed images
met science, mystery and history.

48:38.560 --> 48:39.360
Oh the humanity.

48:39.400 --> 48:41.730
The Hindenberg is one
of the those episodes

48:41.780 --> 48:42.839
in the category of I can't

48:42.840 --> 48:44.510
believe we hadn't thought of that before.

48:44.580 --> 48:46.850
You don't want to mix blur with blur.

48:51.750 --> 48:53.400
Because once we started to dive into it,

48:53.450 --> 48:55.170
there's so much rich material,

48:55.220 --> 48:58.040
so many pieces that you
can start to tease out of

48:58.090 --> 48:59.420
and get a great episode out of it.

49:00.620 --> 49:03.130
These things are always camping on fire.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.410
That is textbook definition of irony kids.

49:07.990 --> 49:09.770
The thing I enjoyed most about this,

49:09.830 --> 49:13.860
was the actual process,
building these large minute chu,

49:13.910 --> 49:17.520
playing around with the material
that was doped with termite.

49:17.590 --> 49:20.140
Now we're going two to
blow up some zeppelins.

49:23.440 --> 49:26.030
It was just such a joy
to work on these things

49:26.080 --> 49:29.250
and fact that they lined up so perfectly

49:29.300 --> 49:32.410
with the actual original
footage, it was wonderful.

49:33.170 --> 49:38.030
This is my favorite scale experiment
we've ever done, full stop.

49:39.540 --> 49:43.060
I reject your t-shirt
slogan and substitute my own.

49:45.180 --> 49:48.820
Well, as Adam would say,
there's your problem.

49:48.930 --> 49:50.000
In at number 7,

49:50.040 --> 49:53.480
we are compiling and
celebrating the one-line wonders

49:53.540 --> 49:56.230
an recurring themes you love the most.

49:58.200 --> 49:59.860
Because people watch "Mythbusters"

49:59.910 --> 50:04.660
and over and over and over sometimes
things we say, off the cuff.

50:04.820 --> 50:05.660
Crack, damn you.

50:05.720 --> 50:09.100
Become memorable lines that
are repeat and put on t-shirts.

50:09.140 --> 50:13.050
Reject your reality and substitute my own.

50:13.190 --> 50:14.980
Give me one big boom.

50:16.520 --> 50:17.480
I'm fine, I'm fine.

50:17.530 --> 50:19.740
Am I missing an eyebrow?

50:20.020 --> 50:21.520
Am I missing an eyebrow?

50:21.610 --> 50:23.200
Actually for me,

50:23.250 --> 50:25.440
the funniest part about
that clip isn't the am I

50:25.480 --> 50:28.630
missing the eyebrow line
it's when Jamie goes yeah

50:28.670 --> 50:30.980
are and most of your hair.

50:31.030 --> 50:32.700
I am missing an a eyebrow, aren't I?

50:32.740 --> 50:34.770
Yeah and some of your hair.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.650
I lose all of my sense
of humor in a nano second.

50:38.750 --> 50:41.900
You're all right it won't look weird

50:42.380 --> 50:44.190
- after a day or two.
- One of my favorites is...

50:45.010 --> 50:47.670
Holy crap, run! Run, run!

50:48.960 --> 50:51.630
Because we really, really use it a lot.

50:51.740 --> 50:52.820
Unintentionally.

50:52.950 --> 50:53.860
Here comes chaos.

50:53.960 --> 50:56.570
My toast always lands butter side up.

50:56.730 --> 50:57.860
There's your problem.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.920
Pillage.

51:01.380 --> 51:03.050
I don't know if that's
legal in California.

51:03.170 --> 51:04.050
Go get 'erm, boy.

51:04.380 --> 51:06.100
That is messed up.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.860
I wouldn't say Jamie is an evil genius.

51:07.970 --> 51:10.190
Say hello to our little friends.

51:10.320 --> 51:11.440
This is going to kill you.

51:11.760 --> 51:14.400
High explosives and electricity, Whoo!

51:14.650 --> 51:16.930
That's why we can never
have anything nice.

51:17.020 --> 51:19.150
It's like a wet t-shirt contest really.

51:19.250 --> 51:21.030
This is the kind of thing
I do on the weekends.

51:21.100 --> 51:22.750
It's starting to feel like a bad idea.

51:22.920 --> 51:24.170
Almost too exciting.

51:24.230 --> 51:25.680
As fast as I can.

51:25.820 --> 51:27.540
I'm making a rocket out of me.

51:27.750 --> 51:30.510
Our death ray doesn't seem to be working.

51:30.650 --> 51:34.160
I'm stand right in it
and I'm not dead yet.

51:34.350 --> 51:36.210
That was intense, that was heavy.

51:36.610 --> 51:39.820
But it's not just the one
liners that top the fan charts.

51:40.400 --> 51:43.950
There are a few much loved
scenes and motifs as well.

51:45.050 --> 51:46.520
There's the dark side.

51:47.260 --> 51:49.030
I am your father.

51:50.350 --> 51:51.260
Never!

51:51.310 --> 51:52.600
You're not my father.

51:54.120 --> 51:55.200
The light side.

51:55.420 --> 51:57.670
What makes my voice sound much higher.

51:57.730 --> 51:58.890
The slippery side.

51:58.980 --> 52:01.890
Jamie has built entire special
effects set out of lard.

52:02.120 --> 52:05.320
Sometimes you just need extra lubrication.

52:05.460 --> 52:07.200
And then there's Jamie.

52:07.320 --> 52:08.640
Who wrote this crap.

52:09.500 --> 52:12.473
Come silent walrus,
let us storm the castle,

52:12.474 --> 52:14.230
I will don my safety gear.

52:21.760 --> 52:24.230
Jamie, under water.

52:25.520 --> 52:26.720
The funny thing about Jamie,

52:26.790 --> 52:30.710
the longer the show is on, the
more kind of iconic he becomes.

52:31.860 --> 52:34.280
Does this remind you of when you
used to count money for the mob?

52:34.410 --> 52:36.510
I was a hit man, not a money counter.

52:36.910 --> 52:40.110
He's like a superhero figure now.

52:40.740 --> 52:41.980
How are we going to test this one.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.500
But he's just a normal guy,

52:43.640 --> 52:46.900
he puts his beret on the
same way any other guy

52:46.940 --> 52:48.700
who chooses to wear a beret.

52:49.330 --> 52:51.270
Jaimie pensive.

52:52.600 --> 52:56.010
over my shoulder is a wild Hyneman

52:56.170 --> 52:58.550
in his natural environment and he seems,

52:58.740 --> 53:01.210
if I'm correct, to be dung hunting.

53:04.470 --> 53:07.410
So little is known about
his elusive an match.

53:07.470 --> 53:10.840
There's this tenuous existence
at the very edges of society.

53:11.600 --> 53:12.630
Shad.

53:13.130 --> 53:17.220
Stay very quiet, they
are deadly if provoked.

53:18.430 --> 53:19.260
Scared.

53:19.890 --> 53:21.070
Let's see what he does.

53:23.120 --> 53:24.340
He's gone into hiding.

53:24.900 --> 53:27.230
Is he doing his David
Attenborough thing again?

53:29.390 --> 53:30.690
See, you can't use that.

53:31.070 --> 53:32.010
He will kill me.

53:50.340 --> 53:53.320
The Alcatraz escape is such
a classic "Mythbusters" story,

53:53.680 --> 53:55.680
there's such mystery surrounding is it

53:55.740 --> 53:58.120
and we may never know
what happen that night.

53:58.380 --> 54:00.600
The spoon is mightier than the bars.

54:00.660 --> 54:03.390
And supposedly escape
proof Alcatraz prison.

54:03.440 --> 54:05.790
That's one of the episodes
I'm still most proud of

54:05.830 --> 54:08.150
and most astonished that we got to do.

54:08.190 --> 54:11.950
Who else has actually
gotten into the water off

54:12.010 --> 54:15.650
of Alcatraz and paddled
their way to safety in a boat?

54:16.060 --> 54:18.590
And it was that kind of
commitment to the cause

54:18.650 --> 54:21.310
that squeezes this myth into the top ten.

54:22.500 --> 54:25.430
And it began when armed
with the precise details

54:25.470 --> 54:28.620
of the legendary getaway,
the prevailing conditions,

54:28.740 --> 54:31.010
the convicts' materials and plans,

54:31.170 --> 54:34.460
Adam and Jamie embarked
on an ingenious build.

54:37.210 --> 54:38.530
I think one of the funniest things

54:38.580 --> 54:41.180
I've seen us do on the
show is Adam banging

54:41.230 --> 54:43.220
away on the raft on the table in the shop

54:43.260 --> 54:44.880
while we were building this thing.

54:45.760 --> 54:50.230
And then stopping and saying...
wait, was that a guard?

54:51.390 --> 54:52.650
No.

54:57.540 --> 55:00.350
With the stealth and
subtlety of a prison riot,

55:00.490 --> 55:04.610
Adam and Jamie completed
their flimsy rubber raincoat

55:06.870 --> 55:09.760
raft and headed for the rock
where they faced the cold,

55:09.850 --> 55:11.861
dark, turbulent waters of

55:11.862 --> 55:15.240
frisco bay in obligatory convict costumes.

55:17.970 --> 55:19.040
You look funny.

55:19.920 --> 55:20.930
You don't?

55:23.850 --> 55:26.570
Here we were I the middle of
the night in this rough waters

55:26.620 --> 55:29.250
and we just built this
raft out of raincoats

55:29.290 --> 55:31.320
and we have do dive into
it and see what happens.

55:32.080 --> 55:35.550
We spent 25 hours putting together

55:35.870 --> 55:38.660
all the components of
the Alcatraz escape boat.

55:39.430 --> 55:44.130
And yet, even after all that
work... Jamie, you're the man, baby.

55:44.440 --> 55:45.940
We kind of expected it to disintegrate

55:45.990 --> 55:47.870
and honestly sitting
in the little row boat

55:47.920 --> 55:50.380
watching Jamie do his
caterpillar dance out

55:50.430 --> 55:52.040
on the Alcatraz raft,

55:52.440 --> 55:55.670
I couldn't believe it was
holding up to that kind of abuse.

55:58.070 --> 55:59.610
Despite the team's fears

55:59.660 --> 56:03.660
and the sheer unlikelihood
of the being successful.

56:03.720 --> 56:08.330
All of a sudden, astonishingly the
Mythbusters were break out of Alcatraz.

56:08.960 --> 56:09.980
We're escaping!

56:12.000 --> 56:13.670
The other most astonishing thing

56:13.820 --> 56:17.450
about the escape is how
crappy Jamie's rowing is.

56:17.810 --> 56:19.870
I have no idea where we are.

56:19.970 --> 56:22.650
if you look carefully, you'll
see that I'm doing all the work.

56:22.700 --> 56:24.080
I'm up there at the tip of the boat,

56:24.380 --> 56:28.300
shoveling the water, shoveling
the water, pushing it across.

56:28.470 --> 56:32.880
Look at Jamie's oar, he's
not like even doing anything.

56:33.060 --> 56:35.126
I still yet to hear a suitable

56:35.127 --> 56:37.950
explanation for why he's doing so little.

56:41.030 --> 56:43.350
This is so cool.

56:43.480 --> 56:45.590
It seemed like for the entire voyage

56:45.640 --> 56:47.400
that the things were about ready to sink.

56:47.670 --> 56:49.580
But sooner or later,

56:49.620 --> 56:53.440
the opposite side of the shore
came into view and we were out.

56:54.140 --> 56:55.130
It actually worked.

56:55.250 --> 56:56.060
It was amazing.

56:59.050 --> 57:00.120
We made it!

57:08.470 --> 57:10.280
Demolition derby was
my favorite episode ever

57:10.310 --> 57:13.890
because we got to do the car drop.

57:16.610 --> 57:20.090
The car drop was
logistically, technically.

57:20.150 --> 57:22.870
All those years of video
games are going to pay off now.

57:23.020 --> 57:27.299
Emotionally, the hardest
thing we've ever ever achieved.

57:27.300 --> 57:29.140
Here it comes.

57:30.810 --> 57:33.550
Now, to explain what the myth is,

57:33.610 --> 57:38.760
it's luxury car commercial
and they suspend a luxury car

57:38.890 --> 57:42.540
from a helicopter and they
start another luxury car

57:42.610 --> 57:43.990
at starting line on the ground.

57:44.430 --> 57:48.030
And both are racing towards
this giant x drawn out

57:48.090 --> 57:51.230
in the middle of the desert. In the end,

57:51.280 --> 57:52.530
of course the luxury car on the ground

57:52.580 --> 57:55.860
is faster than gravity
and it zooms past the x

57:56.810 --> 58:00.180
just before the other car drops
and shatters into a million pieces.

58:00.320 --> 58:02.500
This is quiet.

58:02.860 --> 58:05.760
Too quiet, like the calm before the storm.

58:07.810 --> 58:09.530
Look ma, no hands!

58:09.650 --> 58:11.550
This is going to be nuts!

58:12.460 --> 58:15.350
So in my career, I've agreed
to control a lot of things,

58:15.420 --> 58:17.850
vehicles big and small, robots.

58:18.170 --> 58:21.550
Oh, okay, I'm going to take it down here.

58:21.970 --> 58:26.680
But I think this one in particular
was one of the hardest things

58:26.720 --> 58:27.670
that I've ever done.

58:27.780 --> 58:28.450
How you feeling?

58:29.140 --> 58:29.840
All right.

58:30.590 --> 58:32.230
Really? Because you look
like you're freaking out.

58:32.360 --> 58:34.760
But despite that stress and pressure,

58:34.810 --> 58:38.400
everyone geared up for the
grandest of grand finales.

58:38.460 --> 58:39.580
All right, here we go.

58:40.360 --> 58:43.090
When we actually executed this myth,

58:43.140 --> 58:45.280
it's one of those things where 100 things

58:45.310 --> 58:49.120
have to go right but only
one thing can go wrong

58:49.160 --> 58:51.040
and it will ruin everything.

58:51.720 --> 58:52.900
It's very true for this.

58:52.950 --> 58:54.220
It was so complicated.

58:54.430 --> 58:56.170
You're all buckled in, good job.

58:56.240 --> 58:57.930
I'm all buckled in and ready to go.

59:01.670 --> 59:02.520
There it goes.

59:03.010 --> 59:04.150
Here we go.

59:05.860 --> 59:07.070
This is crazy.

59:08.520 --> 59:11.030
There was a giant cargo helicopter

59:11.160 --> 59:13.900
with a quick release,
holding up a real car.

59:14.780 --> 59:18.300
There was a radio controlled
luxury car on the ground

59:18.650 --> 59:21.530
that I'm controlling from a helicopter.

59:22.210 --> 59:24.870
All right, car is being
lifted off the ground.

59:25.620 --> 59:27.290
Oh, man.

59:30.080 --> 59:34.780
It's like juggling a
dozen different balls,

59:34.870 --> 59:38.370
having them all up in the air
and not dropping a single one.

59:39.490 --> 59:40.620
We're at a thousand feet.

59:41.220 --> 59:46.860
Being in a helicopter that
size and watching from above,

59:46.940 --> 59:51.790
I got to watch the car
drop slowly become tiny,

59:51.880 --> 59:54.270
hit the ground, poof.

59:54.360 --> 59:56.600
In your own time, start driving.

59:56.920 --> 59:57.610
Okay.

59:57.730 --> 01:00:00.550
Here we go, three, two, one!

01:00:01.722 --> 01:00:03.914
Car is away.

01:00:04.471 --> 01:00:05.929
What's the speed, grant?

01:00:06.001 --> 01:00:06.887
45.

01:00:06.963 --> 01:00:08.398
45 miles an hour.

01:00:08.495 --> 01:00:10.574
60 miles an hour.

01:00:13.094 --> 01:00:14.180
Looking great.

01:00:16.118 --> 01:00:16.915
80.

01:00:17.074 --> 01:00:18.249
Car is looking good.

01:00:18.347 --> 01:00:19.626
We're going straight for the x.

01:00:21.992 --> 01:00:23.852
We're at 95 miles an hour.

01:00:23.907 --> 01:00:25.106
Stay on target.

01:00:25.793 --> 01:00:28.215
Looking good, Grant, looking good.

01:00:28.216 --> 01:00:29.165
Standby.

01:00:29.595 --> 01:00:31.147
Coming up to the mark soon.

01:00:31.238 --> 01:00:32.000
Okay.

01:00:32.135 --> 01:00:33.257
500 feet.

01:00:33.333 --> 01:00:34.596
Stay on target.

01:00:36.685 --> 01:00:39.295
Dropping. In three, two, one!

01:00:39.372 --> 01:00:41.122
Release the car!

01:00:41.257 --> 01:00:42.338
Here it comes.

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:45.477
Holding 105.

01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:47.036
Here comes the car.

01:00:47.115 --> 01:00:48.730
Holding 105!

01:00:52.135 --> 01:00:53.778
The car is coming up.

01:00:57.044 --> 01:00:58.546
Mission accomplished.

01:00:58.931 --> 01:01:01.170
Myth busted and in terms of team

01:01:01.248 --> 01:01:03.430
effort, our intrepid trio's most

01:01:03.522 --> 01:01:04.914
memorable myth yet.

01:01:05.044 --> 01:01:06.714
I felt I could, you know...

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.929
I had so much adrenaline,

01:01:08.026 --> 01:01:09.671
I felt like I could lift the car myself!

01:01:15.192 --> 01:01:16.368
Just the amount of work

01:01:16.446 --> 01:01:19.162
and things that could go
wrong in this experiment,

01:01:19.244 --> 01:01:20.828
the fact that everything came together

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:22.092
and it all worked.

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:24.534
It still, it blows my mind.

01:01:24.629 --> 01:01:26.725
I till can't get my mind around it.

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:30.854
I mean it was beautiful.

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:34.631
On a personal note, I was
pregnant that whole time,

01:01:34.745 --> 01:01:35.620
I had no idea,

01:01:35.717 --> 01:01:39.120
so I think maybe it was a
little more emotional for me

01:01:39.213 --> 01:01:40.452
than it should have been.

01:01:40.751 --> 01:01:43.320
I was less excited after my first kiss.

01:01:53.681 --> 01:01:56.593
At the top of most fans'
memorable moment lists

01:01:56.648 --> 01:02:00.151
are the trials and
tribulations of Adam and Tory.

01:02:02.801 --> 01:02:04.062
I'm scared.

01:02:05.315 --> 01:02:06.840
I see injuries in my future.

01:02:06.958 --> 01:02:08.554
So here at number 4,

01:02:08.622 --> 01:02:11.623
we' celebrating all of the eye watering...

01:02:14.644 --> 01:02:15.466
I'm okay.

01:02:15.525 --> 01:02:17.330
Wince inducing incidents.

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:21.814
Our pair of bleep happy pain partners

01:02:22.971 --> 01:02:25.628
have produced for your viewing pleasure.

01:02:29.686 --> 01:02:32.349
And one interesting
aspect of the pain game

01:02:33.405 --> 01:02:34.192
I got bit.

01:02:34.344 --> 01:02:36.680
Is how it's developed in the early days

01:02:36.768 --> 01:02:38.353
of calamity and chaos.

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:43.713
To a more refined science.

01:02:45.566 --> 01:02:47.204
Early on in the show I said

01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:48.003
this is a show.

01:02:48.048 --> 01:02:49.080
That's like four minutes of science

01:02:49.155 --> 01:02:50.774
and ten minutes of me hurting myself.

01:02:53.247 --> 01:02:57.035
100 episodes later, I think
the ratio is totally reversed.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:03:00.070
We've got more complex
with our story telling

01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:01.874
so there's more science in that regard

01:03:01.946 --> 01:03:04.450
and I've got more precise and surgical

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:05.933
about inflicting pain on myself.

01:03:05.998 --> 01:03:07.861
I don't know if I'm closer to being sober

01:03:08.311 --> 01:03:10.403
but I'm closer to being dead.

01:03:10.476 --> 01:03:13.390
So I'm able to boil it down to key moments

01:03:13.439 --> 01:03:15.315
that really deliver.

01:03:20.285 --> 01:03:22.915
Okay. I'm totally cool.

01:03:25.756 --> 01:03:26.932
A lot of competition,

01:03:27.509 --> 01:03:28.911
but that might be the worst thing

01:03:28.977 --> 01:03:30.394
I've ever had to do on the show.

01:03:31.566 --> 01:03:34.753
Yep by mixing his drinks
and the high speed camera,

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.103
Adam is at the cutting edge
of accidental entertainment

01:03:38.658 --> 01:03:41.626
and of course Jamie lends a helping hand.

01:03:43.372 --> 01:03:46.014
Holy bleeping bleepty bleep.

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:48.705
Can I do that again? That was kind of fun.

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:50.197
No that made my head ring.

01:03:51.873 --> 01:03:53.729
That was a good size slap there.

01:03:54.065 --> 01:03:55.476
Let's look at it again.

01:04:00.207 --> 01:04:02.122
It's like your whole head is rubber.

01:04:02.897 --> 01:04:05.170
That's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

01:04:05.865 --> 01:04:08.535
Speaking of a helping hand from hyneman.

01:04:10.373 --> 01:04:11.393
Oh, you baby.

01:04:11.521 --> 01:04:13.618
Do I enjoy seeing Adam in pain?

01:04:14.655 --> 01:04:15.640
Shoot me in the ass.

01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:19.775
Well, Adam gives great reaction
so that make for good tv.

01:04:24.373 --> 01:04:27.481
Look, some of Jamie's
supposed entertainment

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.589
at my getting hurt

01:04:28.688 --> 01:04:31.998
is the editor's creatively telling a story

01:04:32.081 --> 01:04:33.392
that isn't quite there.

01:04:34.221 --> 01:04:35.039
Some of it.

01:04:44.911 --> 01:04:46.030
Adam is a pain in the ass.

01:04:46.102 --> 01:04:49.436
So I don't mind if I see
him suffer once in a while.

01:04:53.013 --> 01:04:56.273
The rest of is that Jamie
a sadistic and cruel man.

01:05:00.185 --> 01:05:01.080
Oh, God that hurt.

01:05:01.339 --> 01:05:02.374
It's time to go to bed.

01:05:02.421 --> 01:05:04.830
Next up is Tory, our man of action.

01:05:05.823 --> 01:05:07.620
And accidents.

01:05:08.153 --> 01:05:11.096
A man first to volunteer
for the tough test,

01:05:11.681 --> 01:05:14.998
fearless man and a man
who occasionally fails

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.793
to think things through.

01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:19.546
Oh, Tory, are we ever
gonna have an episode

01:05:19.621 --> 01:05:20.880
where you don't hurt yourself?

01:05:20.988 --> 01:05:23.259
A man who combine all these attributes

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:27.537
to bring us moments of
leg crossing comedy gold.

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:33.321
If I had a nickel for every time I got hit

01:05:33.379 --> 01:05:34.488
in the nuts on this show,

01:05:34.645 --> 01:05:35.824
I could retire.

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:37.840
Oh, dude.

01:05:37.913 --> 01:05:39.097
I hope I can still have kids.

01:05:39.199 --> 01:05:41.026
They're like a magnet to flying thin.

01:05:41.297 --> 01:05:41.927
Hey!

01:05:45.703 --> 01:05:46.880
Maybe I should wear a cup.

01:05:47.427 --> 01:05:48.917
Got to stretch it out a little.

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:51.586
Aside from his magnetic charisma.

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:54.271
That's not nor science, is it?

01:05:54.537 --> 01:05:55.446
That's just for you.

01:05:55.536 --> 01:05:58.486
Tory has a tendency to
trust his fellow hosts.

01:06:03.335 --> 01:06:05.858
I just saw you punch
your several in the head.

01:06:08.973 --> 01:06:11.083
A trust that has, on occasion,

01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:13.080
been taken advantage of it.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.137
Do you smell that?

01:06:14.472 --> 01:06:15.458
What's that?

01:06:16.103 --> 01:06:17.297
Bad things.

01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:20.217
Let's egg him on until he hurts himself.

01:06:20.369 --> 01:06:22.082
The one accident I had that

01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:25.297
I get a lot of questions
about is the like jump

01:06:25.403 --> 01:06:27.137
it seemed like an easy enough thing to do.

01:06:27.425 --> 01:06:29.621
Kari and scottie told me

01:06:29.709 --> 01:06:33.001
I could make it I did a
couple of tests next to it,

01:06:33.066 --> 01:06:34.445
it looked like you totally got it.

01:06:34.503 --> 01:06:36.191
It looked like you cleared it, go for it.

01:06:39.705 --> 01:06:42.279
You wonder why you see him getting hurt.

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:43.549
He took me seriously.

01:06:43.976 --> 01:06:46.089
Tried to jump the little red wagon

01:06:46.199 --> 01:06:49.273
and flew through the air like superman,

01:06:49.445 --> 01:06:51.743
skidded on his face and got up,

01:06:52.731 --> 01:06:53.498
not hurt.

01:06:53.824 --> 01:06:55.138
Not a scratch.

01:06:55.226 --> 01:06:56.177
Totally fine.

01:06:56.342 --> 01:06:59.219
Now that is really fun to watch.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.710
I'm okay.

01:07:07.805 --> 01:07:09.825
Why do I always laugh when you get hurt?

01:07:09.899 --> 01:07:11.138
That looked so bad.

01:07:12.409 --> 01:07:13.599
I can't believe you did that.

01:07:14.658 --> 01:07:16.097
I thought I was going to make it.

01:07:20.819 --> 01:07:21.437
Coming up,

01:07:21.573 --> 01:07:24.657
the top three most memorable
"mythbuster" moment,

01:07:24.839 --> 01:07:26.863
find out who will be number one.

01:07:36.321 --> 01:07:37.651
In at number 3

01:07:37.726 --> 01:07:41.075
is an explosive pairs
of revisits with rockets.

01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:44.212
The revisits are by far
the most scientific thing

01:07:44.272 --> 01:07:46.527
I think we achieve on "Mythbusters. "

01:07:49.973 --> 01:07:51.191
I don't know any other show

01:07:51.263 --> 01:07:54.478
that goes back over old
broadcasts of theirs to say

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:57.682
we got it wrong as part of
the structure of the show.

01:07:58.334 --> 01:07:59.558
Hey, look at that.

01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:01.342
Well, gee, that looks le a bullet

01:08:01.387 --> 01:08:03.484
and I'm proud of the fact
that we are doing them.

01:08:03.617 --> 01:08:06.422
Because what you're ceiling
on the show is the real deal.

01:08:06.523 --> 01:08:07.507
Mistake and all.

01:08:07.604 --> 01:08:09.514
And we fully acknowledge

01:08:09.606 --> 01:08:10.948
that sometimes we get it wrong,

01:08:11.039 --> 01:08:14.662
that means we have to revisit
it to do the job right.

01:08:15.245 --> 01:08:16.633
That thing was going so fast

01:08:16.712 --> 01:08:18.876
that it was in and out
of the range of the camera

01:08:18.947 --> 01:08:20.183
before it knew what was going on.

01:08:20.624 --> 01:08:24.707
And of all the great
mythbusting moments the two

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:28.490
that make to number three
involve result replication

01:08:28.564 --> 01:08:30.184
with rocket sleds.

01:08:30.731 --> 01:08:35.349
First they proved that
to compact a compact,

01:08:36.743 --> 01:08:39.997
you needed a whole lot more
than two trucks traveling

01:08:40.062 --> 01:08:41.504
at highway speeds.

01:08:41.813 --> 01:08:44.173
Let me spell out exactly how
this is going to break down.

01:08:44.334 --> 01:08:45.292
When we put the launch button,

01:08:45.388 --> 01:08:50.531
this back sled fires down to here.

01:08:50.609 --> 01:08:52.736
Where the front sled's
rockets kick into gear

01:08:52.787 --> 01:08:54.812
and carry it the rest of
the way down the track.

01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:57.975
By the time our sled reaches
the end of the track here,

01:08:58.017 --> 01:08:59.652
it ought to be going 700 miles an hour.

01:08:59.747 --> 01:09:02.881
It will then leave the track
across 20 feet of open space,

01:09:02.946 --> 01:09:05.950
it will eventually hit
our car back on the nose.

01:09:06.029 --> 01:09:07.901
Now the car is backed up
against that steel plate

01:09:07.957 --> 01:09:09.093
and concrete block and

01:09:09.171 --> 01:09:11.888
that should simulate our two truck impact

01:09:11.956 --> 01:09:13.363
at the speed of sound.

01:09:14.988 --> 01:09:15.657
Are you ready?

01:09:15.849 --> 01:09:16.412
I'm ready.

01:09:16.473 --> 01:09:17.563
Do you mind if I flip the switch?

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:18.435
Go for it.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.546
This is compact compact rocket sled

01:09:21.607 --> 01:09:24.988
in three, two, one!

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:37.683
That doesn't mess around.

01:09:37.859 --> 01:09:38.947
Oh, no.

01:09:40.169 --> 01:09:42.127
That second stage was a hell of a thing.

01:09:42.209 --> 01:09:45.131
It was like whoomm and
it just disappeared.

01:09:45.974 --> 01:09:50.506
I've seen things so
supersonic and fired cannons

01:09:50.582 --> 01:09:52.756
but that there is something
about that rocket sled

01:09:52.839 --> 01:09:55.395
Watching the sled reach 400 miles an hour

01:09:55.474 --> 01:09:56.765
and the second set of rockets kick in

01:09:56.823 --> 01:10:00.979
and watching it break 700 miles an hour

01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:02.959
hitting the supposedly immoveable objects

01:10:03.849 --> 01:10:06.786
it was like a visceral
experience of something

01:10:06.894 --> 01:10:09.533
that makes me feel good to be alive

01:10:10.152 --> 01:10:11.652
and not in this way.

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:17.231
The rocket sled test

01:10:17.288 --> 01:10:18.812
has to be one of the
most spectacular things

01:10:18.867 --> 01:10:21.857
we've ever done but having been there

01:10:21.902 --> 01:10:25.500
and seen it live it almost too much

01:10:25.567 --> 01:10:27.642
to absorb it all happened so quickly.

01:10:27.759 --> 01:10:29.444
Holy crap.

01:10:31.235 --> 01:10:32.829
The only way we get a chance

01:10:32.887 --> 01:10:35.763
to absorb is by looking
at the footage afterwards.

01:10:37.832 --> 01:10:40.513
And that's where this
moment comes into its own

01:10:40.584 --> 01:10:42.484
because the high speed footage

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.933
is nothing short of spectacular.

01:10:45.628 --> 01:10:48.223
And it's a high point our intrepid trio

01:10:48.297 --> 01:10:49.644
also got to experience

01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:52.566
when they had a result
replication request.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.912
We tested a myth that a car

01:10:55.024 --> 01:10:56.244
gets in a head-on collision

01:10:56.356 --> 01:10:58.359
with a snow plow and gets split in half,

01:10:58.412 --> 01:11:00.563
we could not replicate the results,

01:11:00.627 --> 01:11:02.069
we got it to split halfway

01:11:02.151 --> 01:11:05.091
but not the completely down the middle.

01:11:05.164 --> 01:11:05.979
Cue the car,

01:11:06.104 --> 01:11:07.287
the rockets,

01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:09.481
their sled and bunker.

01:11:09.609 --> 01:11:10.693
In five,

01:11:10.955 --> 01:11:11.980
four,

01:11:12.289 --> 01:11:13.376
three,

01:11:13.567 --> 01:11:14.576
two,

01:11:14.921 --> 01:11:15.909
one.

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:24.624
That was one of the coolest
things I've ever seen.

01:11:25.896 --> 01:11:28.347
That was so much faster than
I thought it was going to be.

01:11:28.434 --> 01:11:29.718
That was great.

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:32.235
It was like here one second and then gone.

01:11:34.806 --> 01:11:36.997
I really didn't think
we were going to be able

01:11:37.056 --> 01:11:38.011
to split a car in half.

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:40.624
I thought the rocket sled was
just going to obliterate it.

01:11:40.692 --> 01:11:44.565
But it cut the car clean in two.

01:11:44.649 --> 01:11:46.797
We found two distinct halves,

01:11:46.862 --> 01:11:49.524
I mean it took so much
force to make that happen

01:11:49.582 --> 01:11:52.009
and the rocket sled delivered.

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:56.091
I cannot believe we split the car in half.

01:11:56.159 --> 01:11:58.032
Look, it went right down the tape line.

01:11:58.675 --> 01:12:01.405
We have two perfect halves of the car.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.816
S like I can't help but smile

01:12:03.889 --> 01:12:06.191
and watching that high
speed footage is just like,

01:12:07.015 --> 01:12:07.885
we did it.

01:12:15.034 --> 01:12:16.024
Even though I was there.

01:12:16.089 --> 01:12:18.456
I can't believe we did it.

01:12:21.731 --> 01:12:22.484
For me,

01:12:22.613 --> 01:12:26.204
using the rocket sled is
one of the closest things

01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:30.831
we get to being wile e.
Coyote in the cartoon.

01:12:53.012 --> 01:12:55.144
In second place is an idiom,

01:12:55.224 --> 01:12:57.072
an interesting insight into just

01:12:57.172 --> 01:12:59.381
what makes Adam and Jamie tick.

01:13:02.698 --> 01:13:03.630
Ta-da.

01:13:04.294 --> 01:13:06.681
Something tells me balloon myth.

01:13:06.779 --> 01:13:08.871
My favorite myth is lead balloon.

01:13:08.955 --> 01:13:11.473
Even though it doesn't
involve any spectacular crashes

01:13:11.562 --> 01:13:14.991
or explosions, this is hands
down my favorite episode.

01:13:15.075 --> 01:13:17.153
The myth is it is totally impossible

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:20.296
make a balloon like this one out of lead.

01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:21.873
So we're going to build one.

01:13:22.045 --> 01:13:24.099
That's the only way to test it is to try.

01:13:24.284 --> 01:13:25.089
That's what we do.

01:13:26.772 --> 01:13:28.205
We've blown up cement truck,

01:13:28.307 --> 01:13:29.795
virtually gone to the moon

01:13:29.898 --> 01:13:30.991
and back on this show

01:13:31.094 --> 01:13:34.873
and still lead balloon
holds the top spot for me.

01:13:35.801 --> 01:13:40.406
No explosions, no rockets
and no Hollywood style stunts.

01:13:40.556 --> 01:13:43.381
So why exactly does this story top Adam

01:13:43.451 --> 01:13:45.886
and Jamie's personal
memorable moment list?

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:47.115
Nice.

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:50.727
It's the episode that
most clearly demonstrates

01:13:50.807 --> 01:13:54.082
how much fun the internal
process of problem solving is

01:13:54.262 --> 01:13:55.464
to me and Jamie.

01:13:55.778 --> 01:13:57.672
We had to go into our heads

01:13:57.754 --> 01:14:00.776
and walk through every last step

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.660
and detail with absolutely
no room for error.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.709
The problem is this,

01:14:07.772 --> 01:14:09.105
it just kind of falls apart.

01:14:09.182 --> 01:14:12.669
It's almost like wet toilet paper.

01:14:12.732 --> 01:14:14.439
And that it actually worked,

01:14:14.523 --> 01:14:15.829
it was just thrilling.

01:14:16.553 --> 01:14:18.310
And cornerstone of that success

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.037
was ingenious design
from our swami of origami.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.883
The biggest problem the lead is
giving us, is that it's delicate.

01:14:25.964 --> 01:14:28.034
We have to build our
three-dimensional shape

01:14:28.107 --> 01:14:30.339
flat and inflate it.

01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:32.911
So with their elegant design in mind

01:14:32.997 --> 01:14:36.108
and incredibly delicate material in hand,

01:14:36.165 --> 01:14:39.300
the team went to work with
military-like precision

01:14:39.362 --> 01:14:43.904
to build the supposedly
oxymoronic lead balloon.

01:14:44.506 --> 01:14:46.690
This whole build depends on

01:14:46.785 --> 01:14:48.547
how carefully we do this.

01:14:48.699 --> 01:14:51.613
It has to be pristine,

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:53.051
we're going lay down paper,

01:14:53.124 --> 01:14:54.294
we're going to be wearing booties,

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:57.581
this is going to be
like a medical procedure.

01:14:57.889 --> 01:15:01.571
My flat pack cube design
is something I thought about

01:15:01.648 --> 01:15:03.398
for weeks and weeks

01:15:03.475 --> 01:15:05.246
before we implemented it

01:15:05.319 --> 01:15:08.907
I was thinking it had to be a simple shape

01:15:09.007 --> 01:15:11.915
and I settled upon a cube as probably easy

01:15:12.032 --> 01:15:13.928
to make in the conditions

01:15:13.991 --> 01:15:15.256
we had to make it which was flat

01:15:15.309 --> 01:15:16.568
and you couldn't move the lead

01:15:16.653 --> 01:15:19.415
once it was laid down it
had to be built in place.

01:15:19.479 --> 01:15:21.008
It's all working out quite well right now,

01:15:21.075 --> 01:15:22.929
makes me nervous

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.071
one of the other reasons
I love lead balloon

01:15:26.097 --> 01:15:27.918
is its total pointlessness.

01:15:27.968 --> 01:15:30.944
To do something so pointless
and so successfully.

01:15:31.011 --> 01:15:32.469
Nobody needs to know how to make a balloon

01:15:32.574 --> 01:15:34.958
out of lead but now we do know.

01:15:35.335 --> 01:15:38.312
And I find that strangely thrilling.

01:15:39.088 --> 01:15:39.803
Hey, Adam.

01:15:39.907 --> 01:15:40.539
Yeah.

01:15:41.419 --> 01:15:43.225
Congratulations on the design

01:15:43.292 --> 01:15:45.437
it unfolded and twisted out

01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:46.555
just the way it was supposed.

01:15:46.619 --> 01:15:48.464
Whether it flies or not I don't know

01:15:48.523 --> 01:15:49.821
but your plan works.

01:15:50.098 --> 01:15:51.777
I'm really psyched about this one.

01:15:51.991 --> 01:15:54.846
He was psyched already, but also frantic.

01:15:54.912 --> 01:15:56.220
Opening tank three.

01:15:56.364 --> 01:15:58.228
Narrator: Because in the closing stage,

01:15:58.295 --> 01:15:59.674
the pace picked up,

01:15:59.827 --> 01:16:03.058
Rips and tears appeared
as fast as they could hear

01:16:03.179 --> 01:16:04.274
but the lead balloon...

01:16:05.471 --> 01:16:08.946
like Adam's voice, kept rising.

01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:09.884
I got to tell you

01:16:09.943 --> 01:16:11.237
I'm pretty happy about
this thing right now.

01:16:11.306 --> 01:16:11.964
I'm pretty excited.

01:16:12.013 --> 01:16:13.979
It's a lead balloon, oh, my God,

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:14.792
I'm getting dizzy.

01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:20.033
It's a balloon made out
of lead and it's up there.

01:16:20.127 --> 01:16:21.017
It's floating.

01:16:21.356 --> 01:16:22.414
It worked.

01:16:24.986 --> 01:16:25.748
Dude.

01:16:26.987 --> 01:16:28.551
That is the lead balloon.

01:16:30.695 --> 01:16:32.166
I am reallied.

01:16:32.803 --> 01:16:35.030
We might have been able to get
away with a smaller balloon,

01:16:36.177 --> 01:16:38.511
but this is the lead balloon.

01:16:38.923 --> 01:16:39.940
We did it.

01:16:54.066 --> 01:16:55.566
So here it is.

01:16:55.809 --> 01:16:59.514
The number one "Mythbusters"
most memorable moment

01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:03.995
and appropriately the
top 25 countdown concludes

01:17:04.095 --> 01:17:05.378
with a countdown.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.864
Jamie wants big boom.

01:17:08.005 --> 01:17:09.597
Big boom, big boom!

01:17:09.685 --> 01:17:11.112
In three.

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:12.046
Two.

01:17:12.257 --> 01:17:12.801
One!

01:17:13.157 --> 01:17:16.931
Narrator: Explosions,

01:17:18.093 --> 01:17:19.989
combustions,

01:17:20.316 --> 01:17:21.931
conflagrations.

01:17:22.182 --> 01:17:25.678
??

01:17:26.234 --> 01:17:28.752
And plain old big booms.

01:17:31.589 --> 01:17:33.337
Everybody say it with me,

01:17:33.824 --> 01:17:35.965
Jamie wants big boom!

01:17:39.492 --> 01:17:42.109
Are all part of the fabric of the show.

01:17:44.567 --> 01:17:46.427
That's what we do on "Mythbusters,"

01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:48.017
we blow crap up.

01:17:48.931 --> 01:17:51.088
So here at number one,

01:17:51.231 --> 01:17:53.651
we celebrate the biggest booms,

01:17:53.792 --> 01:17:56.041
the moste defining detonations

01:17:57.274 --> 01:17:59.881
and the scariest fire balls.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.334
But first to start the end with a bang,

01:18:04.506 --> 01:18:08.067
the all-time fan favorite explosion,

01:18:08.168 --> 01:18:10.835
the truck that disappeared in the light.

01:18:10.921 --> 01:18:15.793
The cement truck is by far the
fan favorite explosion full stop.

01:18:16.783 --> 01:18:20.057
Well, we're going to use 850 pounds of

01:18:20.147 --> 01:18:21.755
commercial blasting agent.

01:18:21.867 --> 01:18:25.024
Isn't this like the biggest
explosion we've done.

01:18:25.073 --> 01:18:26.941
This is the biggest by like a 1,000%.

01:18:27.033 --> 01:18:30.521
I think cement truck became a fan favorite

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:33.380
because it's like your first kiss.

01:18:33.591 --> 01:18:34.816
It's something that
you're going to remember.

01:18:34.888 --> 01:18:36.849
Well, that's what we do on "Mythbusters,"

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:39.850
we take large objects and
make them into small ones.

01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:41.655
But it wasn't explosion itself

01:18:41.719 --> 01:18:43.619
that gets people going about it.

01:18:43.684 --> 01:18:46.059
Fire in the hole, fire in the hole.

01:18:46.142 --> 01:18:48.680
It was the simple elegance of the thing.

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:51.974
First it was there and
then it was just gone

01:18:52.057 --> 01:18:53.803
it blows people away.

01:18:53.972 --> 01:18:54.729
Five,

01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:55.959
four,

01:18:56.307 --> 01:18:57.226
three,

01:18:57.642 --> 01:18:58.453
two,

01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:59.712
one.

01:19:05.618 --> 01:19:07.471
Piece of junk coming down, man.

01:19:12.557 --> 01:19:13.938
There's aspects of it

01:19:14.018 --> 01:19:15.820
that I really wish could be communicated

01:19:15.877 --> 01:19:17.296
that isn't there in the episode,

01:19:17.356 --> 01:19:19.433
we were standing a mile and a half from

01:19:19.535 --> 01:19:20.710
where that truck blew up,

01:19:21.010 --> 01:19:22.409
which meant that the shock wave

01:19:22.511 --> 01:19:26.315
and the sound took two different
periods of time to reach us.

01:19:26.432 --> 01:19:28.782
We stood there and
watched a silent explosion.

01:19:29.239 --> 01:19:30.646
And literally a second later

01:19:30.739 --> 01:19:33.205
a shock wave hit us
which nobody was expecting

01:19:33.267 --> 01:19:36.059
and it felt like somebody
just hit me in the chest.

01:19:38.545 --> 01:19:39.809
It seemed so peaceful.

01:19:39.887 --> 01:19:40.829
And we just like...

01:19:44.085 --> 01:19:45.262
If you have a chance

01:19:45.493 --> 01:19:47.453
to watch the cement truck get filled

01:19:47.527 --> 01:19:50.107
with 850 pounds of fuel and blown up,

01:19:54.605 --> 01:19:55.893
I highly recommend it.

01:19:56.018 --> 01:19:57.415
Well, there's your problem.

01:19:58.034 --> 01:19:58.940
Where'd it go?

01:20:00.144 --> 01:20:00.924
It's all gone.

01:20:01.021 --> 01:20:01.954
There's no more truck.

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:03.465
I theft right here.

01:20:04.394 --> 01:20:07.329
One cement truck.

01:20:08.678 --> 01:20:10.513
This has got nothing to do with the myth.

01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:12.311
This is just a big boom.

01:20:14.694 --> 01:20:16.480
But that was just the start

01:20:16.599 --> 01:20:19.301
of a beautiful big boom relationship.

01:20:19.688 --> 01:20:20.649
Over the years,

01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:23.125
the team has had the opportunity to savor

01:20:23.214 --> 01:20:26.300
and appreciate a wide
variety of explosions

01:20:26.384 --> 01:20:27.982
and conflagrations.

01:20:30.172 --> 01:20:32.049
Because the show has been
on the air for so long

01:20:32.233 --> 01:20:33.806
and because we've been able to work with

01:20:33.893 --> 01:20:35.793
so many different types of explosions.

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:37.966
Every explosion has its own taste,

01:20:38.411 --> 01:20:39.320
it's own feel.

01:20:39.442 --> 01:20:40.264
Bye-bye.

01:20:41.646 --> 01:20:44.055
When in doubt, c4.

01:20:47.541 --> 01:20:51.156
The high speed explosives
like the plastic explosive, c4,

01:20:51.285 --> 01:20:53.474
those tend to be really snappy.

01:20:54.283 --> 01:20:57.287
Those tend to have a really sharp crack.

01:20:58.861 --> 01:21:00.240
They don't last very long.

01:21:00.295 --> 01:21:02.959
Three, two, one.

01:21:03.489 --> 01:21:05.321
Like exploding microwave.

01:21:09.247 --> 01:21:11.792
Low speed explosives
like dynamite and amfo,

01:21:11.886 --> 01:21:14.883
they have a much throatier
thud you really feel them

01:21:14.969 --> 01:21:17.294
in your solar plexus, they're awesome.

01:21:27.955 --> 01:21:30.122
But big is not always best.

01:21:30.297 --> 01:21:33.268
Kari for one prefers a
little bloom in her booms,

01:21:33.352 --> 01:21:37.485
a visual flourish that
requires additional ingredients.

01:21:39.934 --> 01:21:43.819
My favorite explosions always
involve some sort of fuel.

01:21:44.178 --> 01:21:46.005
I love when you add gasoline.

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:47.691
I love when you add propane.

01:21:51.378 --> 01:21:54.284
I love when you add coffee creamer.

01:21:54.401 --> 01:21:56.568
Three, two, one!

01:22:03.689 --> 01:22:05.362
It was like armageddon.

01:22:06.828 --> 01:22:08.718
We had this huge 50 foot wall of

01:22:08.793 --> 01:22:10.867
flames coming down on us

01:22:10.945 --> 01:22:14.283
and it was like holy
crap, I'm going to die.

01:22:15.416 --> 01:22:17.199
That was frightening!

01:22:21.784 --> 01:22:24.291
Quite honestly though my
favorite explosions of all

01:22:24.421 --> 01:22:27.629
aren't even technically from
a physics standpoint explosion,

01:22:27.713 --> 01:22:29.797
it's like watching hot water heaters fail.

01:22:30.921 --> 01:22:31.903
Normally as an explosion,

01:22:31.984 --> 01:22:33.092
you ever control over it,

01:22:33.172 --> 01:22:34.208
you have a prime,

01:22:34.281 --> 01:22:35.659
you have your finger on the button

01:22:35.741 --> 01:22:37.541
and it goes off,

01:22:37.650 --> 01:22:39.718
but when you're waiting for
a pressure investigate toll

01:22:39.818 --> 01:22:42.485
explode, you have no idea
when it's gonna go off

01:22:42.555 --> 01:22:44.836
you have no idea how big it's going to be.

01:22:44.942 --> 01:22:46.385
Just you and me.

01:22:46.449 --> 01:22:49.415
Those moments are
probably the most exciting.

01:23:00.359 --> 01:23:01.024
Now another thing

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.938
that people don't realize on the show

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.802
is that we often end up exploding things

01:23:06.871 --> 01:23:09.789
that aren't specifically explosives.

01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:12.312
For example, co 2.

01:23:13.065 --> 01:23:14.260
Two words.

01:23:17.353 --> 01:23:18.686
Sounds like.

01:23:22.113 --> 01:23:23.541
Sometimes people ask us

01:23:23.628 --> 01:23:26.471
if we're acting when an explosion goes off

01:23:26.559 --> 01:23:28.990
and we're screaming and
yelling and high fiving.

01:23:29.073 --> 01:23:31.714
It's an explosion, are you kidding me?

01:23:40.051 --> 01:23:43.163
There's something about
that release of energy.

01:23:44.137 --> 01:23:45.171
You feel it.

01:23:45.433 --> 01:23:48.647
And feel a little scare
and a little excited.

01:23:55.349 --> 01:23:56.952
Is everybody okay?

01:23:57.232 --> 01:23:59.346
Explosions are sort
of a cathartic release.

01:23:59.453 --> 01:24:03.231
You get this amazing, beautiful

01:24:03.334 --> 01:24:06.419
dirt throwing flame throwing plume

01:24:06.531 --> 01:24:10.251
that throws a shock wave
ought that you can just feel.

01:24:13.274 --> 01:24:15.268
Why are explosions such an
integral part of the show?

01:24:15.335 --> 01:24:16.324
No more car!

01:24:16.423 --> 01:24:18.950
It's not only because
we love to blow stuff up.

01:24:22.537 --> 01:24:24.678
One way that you can
tell that "Mythbusters"

01:24:24.762 --> 01:24:29.093
has been in the area is to
look for shrapnel in the trees.

01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:30.629
It really seems to be that

01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:33.398
most of the best stories
end with something

01:24:33.464 --> 01:24:36.354
being destroyed in some
spectacular fashion.

01:24:36.448 --> 01:24:38.035
And when you wanted to destroy something

01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:39.972
in a spectacular fashion,

01:24:40.687 --> 01:24:42.184
well, we've dried most things

01:24:42.242 --> 01:24:44.794
and few work better than explosions.

01:24:45.741 --> 01:24:48.965
Which gives us the opportunity
to reconfirm the myth

01:24:49.039 --> 01:24:51.324
that it's better to end with a bang.

01:24:51.617 --> 01:24:53.730
We made something blow up!

01:24:55.786 --> 01:24:57.756
So sit back, relax

01:24:57.847 --> 01:25:02.488
and enjoy the chart topping
most memorable "Mythbusters"

01:25:02.621 --> 01:25:03.858
greatest hits.
