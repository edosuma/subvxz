WEBVTT

00:03.124 --> 00:05.773
For his selfless action off-duty
sustaining a gunshot wound…

00:05.813 --> 00:08.300
during the apprehension
of a major gun-running ring…

00:08.340 --> 00:12.977
and for exhibiting the type
of individual awareness, initiative…

00:13.172 --> 00:17.452
and resourcefulness that serves
as an inspiration for all officers…

00:17.492 --> 00:19.437
I'm proud to hereby present
Detective Vic Mackey…

00:19.477 --> 00:24.031
with the department's highest honor
for valor and courage under fire.

00:29.364 --> 00:32.812
Uh, everybody here deserves one of these.

00:32.979 --> 00:36.396
I was just the guy holding onto it
when the music stopped.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.705
Thank you.

00:44.883 --> 00:48.267
–Don't think this means you
get a free pass around here.
–Of course not.

00:48.307 --> 00:51.371
–Congratulations, Vic.
–It was Lanie's idea
to recommend you for the medal.

00:51.411 --> 00:53.259
Really? I didn't know that.
Thank you.

00:53.299 --> 00:57.355
It's important that the public knows about
our successes as well as our failures.

00:57.395 --> 01:00.362
We're running your
Toys for Guns drive tomorrow.

01:00.402 --> 01:02.667
That's where people trade in
their guns to the cops?

01:02.707 --> 01:05.930
Yeah. While, uh, Vic was
laid out in the hospital.

01:05.970 --> 01:07.500
–He came up with this great twist for us.
–Yeah.

01:07.540 --> 01:11.178
They get to fill out raffle tickets for
a big prize when they trade in their guns.

01:11.218 --> 01:13.708
Which gives us their name and address.
We run the gun for ballistics.

01:13.748 --> 01:16.650
If they were used in a crime,
we know where to find them.

01:16.690 --> 01:19.401
You thought of that while
you were on a morphine drip?

01:19.441 --> 01:23.466
Well, stolen guns put me there.
I had three weeks to figure out
how to get them off the street.

01:23.506 --> 01:25.677
I'm impressed.

01:30.705 --> 01:32.949
–Thank you, ma'am.
–Enjoy the toy.

01:34.226 --> 01:36.145
–Next.
–Have a nice day.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.621
–What's your name?
–Patty Ann Hinkle.

01:38.961 --> 01:41.007
–That's a pretty name.
–Thanks.

01:41.105 --> 01:46.059
–Where'd you get the gun?
–Home. I don't like it.

01:46.193 --> 01:49.641
–Do I get a toy?
–You sure do.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.608
–Gimme your address.
–It's, uh…

01:57.937 --> 01:59.817
Starting me off with a bang, huh?

01:59.857 --> 02:02.312
A robbery. Ended badly.
One dead.

02:02.608 --> 02:05.257
Witnesses said the shooter gained entry
using a police badge.

02:05.297 --> 02:09.606
Number 714. That's your number.
Where were you two hours ago?

02:10.127 --> 02:13.423
–With me.
–Let me see your badge.

02:19.376 --> 02:22.160
–This is a fake.
–I… I got mugged.

02:22.193 --> 02:25.000
I lost my badge in Tijuana.
I never thought it'd end up back in L.A.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.920
An L.A cop badge
sold on the black market.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.280
–Where the hell else would
you expect it to be used?
–Let's all calm down.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.160
–Did you know about this?
–No. No, he didn't.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.615
–Where'd you get this one?
–This, uh, Serbian guy in Rosehill.

02:36.655 --> 02:39.049
–It's just like the real thing.
–No. No, Officer Vendrell.

02:39.089 --> 02:42.727
It's not. The real thing got used
in an armed robbery and a killing.

02:42.767 --> 02:46.463
I'm gonna clear this whole thing up.
Let me get into it.

02:52.591 --> 02:54.286
I'm sorry, man.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.776
–Where were you two hours ago?
–I was sleeping.

02:56.816 --> 03:00.842
–Aceveda seems pissed, doesn't he?
–It's just like old times.

03:03.855 --> 03:05.672
–Hey. Who's the dead guy?
–He worked here…

03:05.712 --> 03:08.748
along with our witness,
who isn't saying much.

03:13.102 --> 03:16.038
–You saw this go down?
–Is the shooter white? Black?

03:16.078 --> 03:18.729
He had a mask.
Happened quick.

03:18.926 --> 03:20.999
–What'd he take?
–Nothing.

03:21.198 --> 03:23.495
So he used the cop's badge
to get you to unlock the place.

03:23.535 --> 03:27.363
He murders a guy for no reason,
steals nothing and leaves?

03:35.021 --> 03:37.901
This guy definitely
knew what he was after.

03:37.935 --> 03:41.829
Whatever it was, it wasn't supposed
to be here. Am I right?

03:46.989 --> 03:50.213
What if I told you my buddy and I here
have a little side business…

03:50.253 --> 03:52.563
helps victims
get their stuff back.

03:56.365 --> 03:58.916
You offered to get his stolen
merchandise back for a fee?

03:58.956 --> 04:01.284
He was hiding something
he wasn't gonna tell a clean cop.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.876
–You thought this would work?
–It already has. He's cooperating.

04:03.916 --> 04:07.620
The store is a front for
an Armenian mob diamond chop shop.

04:07.660 --> 04:10.373
–He told you this?
–He wants his diamonds back.

04:10.413 --> 04:12.900
They fence hot ice. Recut the gems,
put 'em in different mountings

04:12.940 --> 04:15.556
so they can't be ID'd…
then they resell them.

04:15.596 --> 04:18.378
This is what our shooter stole.

04:23.372 --> 04:26.724
–This is entrapment.
–Just for the jeweler… and he's a guppy.

04:26.764 --> 04:29.033
We're hunting a whale here.

04:29.196 --> 04:31.836
You want us to catch
this killer or not?

04:33.036 --> 04:37.508
Going undercover as dirty cops.
You think you can pull that off?

04:37.771 --> 04:40.771
We can try.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:51.019 --> 04:55.300
You know, being crooked cops when it's my ass
and badge on the line… it's not as fun.

04:55.340 --> 04:57.795
Yeah, well, we're only pretending
to be crooked cops.

04:57.835 --> 04:59.844
So we're not really
taking a cut of the jewelry?

04:59.884 --> 05:03.580
Well, it's always an option,
but today I'm feeling good.

05:08.330 --> 05:10.851
Flip that right there. Yeah.
That's got a little thing right there.

05:10.891 --> 05:12.804
I got some stuff too,
in the back.

05:12.844 --> 05:17.058
Aw, man! You havin' a sidewalk sale
and you didn't invite us, Taylor?

05:17.098 --> 05:20.162
–I thought we was on your mailing list.
–This has a remote, right?

05:20.202 --> 05:23.778
Okay. Listen. I gave you Fleetwood,
okay? I'm free and clear.

05:23.818 --> 05:26.501
Just one more favor…
swear to God.

05:26.665 --> 05:28.866
You know who might be movin'
this kinda stuff?

05:28.906 --> 05:31.841
Uh, no. No. I don't usually
travel in those circles.

05:31.881 --> 05:34.721
–Unh. Hey… Oh.
–Find out who does and then buzz me.

05:34.761 --> 05:38.465
Look, man. You know, Cls are supposed
to be registered and paid, man.

05:38.505 --> 05:42.564
Tell you what. Here's a fin.
Go buy yourself a taco.

05:42.697 --> 05:44.737
That's a $50 box.

05:48.584 --> 05:50.243
Thank you.

05:50.441 --> 05:52.355
I can't believe this.
It was a clean shoot.

05:52.395 --> 05:55.761
I know. I was hoping lawyers
wouldn't get involved.

05:55.912 --> 05:58.420
Let's just hear
what they have to say.

06:03.912 --> 06:05.792
Five million makes this go away.

06:05.832 --> 06:07.808
Well, five million makes me laugh.

06:07.848 --> 06:11.682
–I didn't do anything wrong.
–Your officers improperly
entered the Al-Thani home…

06:11.722 --> 06:14.944
establishing a pattern
of racial insensitivity and abusive behavior.

06:14.984 --> 06:17.600
–He gave us permission to enter.
–Only after you threatened
to bring in the F.B.I.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.544
You treated him like a criminal, which
escalated the dispute with the neighbor.

06:20.584 --> 06:24.256
–She felt she could attack him.
He needed to defend his life.
–This is ridiculous!

06:24.296 --> 06:26.208
The search was legal.
The shooting, by the book.

06:26.248 --> 06:30.528
We don't agree. I'll be expecting
your counteroffer by the end of the day.

06:30.568 --> 06:32.772
I wouldn't hold my breath.

06:32.936 --> 06:38.150
Did I mention we're also naming you
as well as Officer Sofer in the civil suit?

06:38.151 --> 06:40.060
Think it over.

06:44.903 --> 06:46.627
You Tike?

06:46.727 --> 06:48.671
He'll be back later.
What do you want?

06:48.711 --> 06:51.775
How 'bout an honest answer. A friend of mine
says you're trying to move some hot rocks.

06:51.815 --> 06:55.164
Man. What the hell
you doing, man? Huh?

06:55.334 --> 06:57.058
We're cops.

06:57.254 --> 06:59.071
–It's him.
–Give me the keys.

06:59.111 --> 07:04.350
–I'd like to see a warrant.
–I'd like to see Anna Kournikova
naked on a water bed.

07:04.390 --> 07:07.140
–I'm calling 911.
–Go ahead.

07:07.334 --> 07:09.823
We'll come back in five minutes
and take your report.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.446
I'll start with possession
of stolen property.

07:12.486 --> 07:14.687
It's an exact match
to our crime scene.

07:14.727 --> 07:16.550
Who sold you this stuff?

07:16.583 --> 07:19.710
I'll tell you what. You get the guy
who sold you these down here…

07:19.750 --> 07:21.726
and I'll give you
a third of them to keep.

07:21.766 --> 07:24.832
You'll let me keep a third?

07:25.926 --> 07:28.130
Hell of a deal.

07:28.262 --> 07:29.985
What kinda cops are you?

07:30.182 --> 07:33.501
Ballistics just got a hit
on one of Vic's Toys for Guns.

07:33.541 --> 07:36.709
Oh. Well, maybe they'll
give him a second medal.

07:37.862 --> 07:41.597
Slug from a test-fire matches up
to an unsolved murder from last year.

07:41.637 --> 07:43.547
One of yours.

07:44.486 --> 07:46.176
Richard Cummings. Yeah.

07:46.405 --> 07:48.740
Who's Richard Cummings?

07:48.901 --> 07:51.262
This is a guy who took a loan from
a shark named Manny Sandoval.

07:51.302 --> 07:54.140
Couldn't pay the money back,
ended up dead.

07:54.244 --> 07:56.093
It's obvious Manny killed him.

07:56.133 --> 07:59.260
So why does somebody else
have the murder weapon?

07:59.300 --> 08:02.431
–Find out.
–Yeah.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.476
–He's talking to his old lady.
–He's not gonna show.

08:04.516 --> 08:09.020
Mmm. Coffee, cigarettes,
and too much joviality. Smells like a 12-step.

08:09.060 --> 08:11.297
Excuse me.
What program is this?

08:11.461 --> 08:13.697
–Gamblers Anonymous.
–Thanks.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.583
It's that time of year…

08:15.780 --> 08:17.693
Two days after the Super Bowl…

08:17.733 --> 08:20.540
everybody finds a higher power
when they lose their shirts.

08:20.580 --> 08:24.380
–I lost 100 bucks on the goddamn Raiders.
–Shh. I'll be damned.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.940
–What?
–That's Manny Sandoval.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.667
–The loan shark? Where?
–In the alley.

08:29.701 --> 08:32.803
So your suspect is hanging
outside the meeting…

08:32.836 --> 08:35.034
where the guy who owns
the murder weapon is?

08:35.075 --> 08:36.955
–Some coincidence.
–Hell of one.

08:36.995 --> 08:41.119
–You wanna take him in?
–Manny doesn't crack easy.

08:41.283 --> 08:45.085
And he won't sweat unless I'm packing
a lot more info than I got now.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.963
Let's wait and talk
to the gun owner first.

08:53.443 --> 08:55.199
So what's so important?

08:56.355 --> 08:58.467
Hope you hocked enough for bail.

09:00.803 --> 09:02.747
Where's my badge,
you dumb ass? Huh?

09:02.787 --> 09:04.700
Work with me here, all right?
I need a deal.

09:04.740 --> 09:07.226
We don't. We have you
for robbery and homicide…

09:07.266 --> 09:10.746
and being dumb enough to sell
the jewelry that ties you to both.

09:10.786 --> 09:14.683
Look, I needed the money, all right?
But you don't have everything.

09:14.723 --> 09:16.828
–Alex Eznik.
–Alex who?

09:16.962 --> 09:19.962
He runs the Zeroun family
for the Armenian mob. What about him?

09:20.002 --> 09:24.257
–I give you Alex, you shave some years, right?
–Convince me.

09:24.418 --> 09:26.360
I work protection for him.

09:26.497 --> 09:28.441
He owns that jewelry shop I hit.

09:28.481 --> 09:31.994
–And you robbed your own boss?
–I was taking back something
that didn't belong to him.

09:32.034 --> 09:34.137
–That's all.
–Well, why'd you kill the guy?

09:34.177 --> 09:36.057
'Cause he was a thief of Alex's…

09:36.097 --> 09:39.417
who stole some jewelry from
a store I provided protection over.

09:39.457 --> 09:44.029
What? Wait a minute. You work for Alex.
The dead guy worked for Alex.

09:44.321 --> 09:48.161
He robbed from you.
You robbed back and killed him?

09:48.195 --> 09:51.001
–Doesn't sound like a very happy family.
–No. It's not.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.889
Yeah. And Alex
encourages competition…

09:52.929 --> 09:56.409
especially between Russian Armenians
like him and Lebanese Armenians like me.

09:56.449 --> 09:59.515
That's why I didn't mind ripping Alex off.

09:59.648 --> 10:01.880
–What else can you tell me about Alex?
–Everything.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.288
Gambling. Hijacking.

10:04.322 --> 10:06.713
You ever heard a rumor
about a money train?

10:06.753 --> 10:10.361
–What's a money train?
–Story goes it's like a rolling bank vault.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.768
Supersecret.

10:12.802 --> 10:18.478
Supposedly runs out of L.A every couple of
months to clean their dirty money overseas.

10:19.104 --> 10:21.810
How much money
are we talking about here?

10:22.112 --> 10:23.835
I hear it's big.

10:24.032 --> 10:26.749
So who do I
make a deal with?

10:29.407 --> 10:30.719
–No.
–Why not?

10:30.753 --> 10:33.463
Because we've already got the killer.
This is where it ends.

10:33.503 --> 10:35.897
We got a line on the biggest
Armenian mobster in L.A.

10:35.937 --> 10:38.007
–I'm not running a mob task force.
–You don't have to.

10:38.047 --> 10:40.436
You just have to watch.

10:40.608 --> 10:42.786
Let me return the jewels to Alex…

10:42.815 --> 10:45.303
see if he wants to buy a dirty cop.

10:46.463 --> 10:48.759
You're having too much fun
playing this.

10:48.799 --> 10:51.101
Well, inside I'm a sad clown.

10:51.263 --> 10:52.715
What about the jewels?

10:52.736 --> 10:56.375
You already gave a third to the pawnbroker.
You wanna give the rest to the mob boss?

10:56.415 --> 10:58.329
Well, that's the deal I made.

10:58.335 --> 11:01.654
If I want them to think that I'm a corrupt cop,
I at least gotta be honest about it.

11:01.694 --> 11:05.175
I don't like it. And I especially
don't like you in the middle of it.

11:05.215 --> 11:09.143
Hey. You know how Giuliani
became the mayor of New York?

11:09.278 --> 11:11.001
He brought down the mob.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.846
I wanna know
every move you make.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.675
Absolutely.

11:28.382 --> 11:30.291
There he is.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.443
Mr Hinkle.

11:39.581 --> 11:41.970
Detectives Wyms and Wagenbach.

11:42.141 --> 11:44.083
We'd like to speak with you.

11:44.222 --> 11:46.327
Is everything okay?

11:46.461 --> 11:48.697
–I wouldn't bet on it.
–Come on.

11:51.197 --> 11:53.205
That's Richard Cummings…

11:53.245 --> 11:55.893
a man who lost a lot of money
in a restaurant.

11:55.933 --> 11:59.740
He's also a guy who was
into Manny Sandoval for $50·000.

11:59.774 --> 12:03.892
Your gun killed him, so don't bother
wasting our time with a bullshit excuse.

12:03.932 --> 12:08.340
–Where'd you get my gun from?
–Your daughter traded it in
during a toys for guns drive.

12:08.380 --> 12:12.148
How much did Manny pay you to use your
weapon… or did you do it for him?

12:12.188 --> 12:15.549
–What?
–We also checked your phone records.

12:15.582 --> 12:19.540
You seem to call phone booths a lot.
Is that your bookie or your loan shark?

12:19.580 --> 12:21.751
Certainly wasn't your sponsor.

12:25.180 --> 12:27.220
Where's my daughter?

12:29.499 --> 12:33.555
A complaint has been lodged against you
by a man named Abu Ibish.

12:33.595 --> 12:36.115
–Who?
–Six months ago.

12:36.316 --> 12:38.715
Some bar fight you broke up.

12:38.749 --> 12:41.587
–I don't remember.
–At the Lakeside Tavern.

12:43.036 --> 12:44.916
I get a lot of calls there.
What was the complaint?

12:44.956 --> 12:47.861
This guy says that you used racial epithets
prior to arresting him…

12:47.901 --> 12:51.511
derogatory comments
referring to his Arab ethnicity.

12:51.995 --> 12:53.937
This is bullshit.

12:54.043 --> 12:57.554
Well, how would you know?
You don't even remember the arrest.

12:57.594 --> 13:00.278
–I'd remember that.
–Danny…

13:00.474 --> 13:03.092
if you made any anti-Arab comments…

13:03.291 --> 13:05.014
I didn't.

13:05.147 --> 13:08.856
Even in the heat of the moment.
I need to know now.

13:10.298 --> 13:12.819
I didn't.

13:17.754 --> 13:20.055
My name's on that lawsuit too.

13:26.939 --> 13:29.489
–What the hell is that?
–I don't know, but buy me a ticket.

13:29.529 --> 13:31.634
–Yeah.
–Hold it.

13:32.730 --> 13:34.901
He's expecting us.

13:38.873 --> 13:40.662
Mr Eznik.

13:42.329 --> 13:44.500
I believe these are yours.

13:48.249 --> 13:52.243
–Some are missing.
–That's right. A third.

13:52.408 --> 13:55.633
That's the deal I made with your boy
over at the jewelry store.

13:55.673 --> 13:59.185
You made that deal with him. You didn't make
it with me. A third is a lot of money.

13:59.225 --> 14:01.527
It was a lot of work.

14:01.689 --> 14:04.274
I don't like cops in my social club.

14:04.473 --> 14:06.774
Fine. Then we'll leave.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.430
Oh, uh, you have an auto shop
over on Waverly, right?

14:12.568 --> 14:14.897
Yeah. From what we hear,
it's filled with stolen car parts.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.944
Police are gonna raid it
in about three hours.

14:16.984 --> 14:21.802
–Why are you telling me this?
–Shane and I here are looking to moonlight.

14:24.024 --> 14:25.747
First tip's a freebie.

14:25.944 --> 14:27.733
Next one will cost ya.

14:32.568 --> 14:35.183
Now we're waiting for
the Armenian to call back.

14:35.223 --> 14:37.361
–I said keep this simple.
–It is simple.

14:37.401 --> 14:40.943
Oh, uh, I need a raiding party
at this address in two hours.

14:40.983 --> 14:43.151
–Not a moment sooner.
–To find what?

14:43.191 --> 14:45.872
Nothing. It'll be cleared out
by the time they get there.

14:45.912 --> 14:50.223
Look. I know it's your world, but I'm the one
who lets you work in it.

14:50.263 --> 14:51.857
Clear this with me before
next time.

14:51.897 --> 14:54.223
I would have.
I just didn't have a chance.

14:54.263 --> 14:57.135
–What about this money train?
–If it exists, we'll get to it.

14:57.175 --> 15:00.110
–When?
–Soon.

15:00.247 --> 15:03.085
I'm transferring Shane
off the Strike Team.

15:04.247 --> 15:06.862
–What?
–I see you're listening to me now.

15:06.902 --> 15:08.222
Shane is my partner.

15:08.343 --> 15:12.633
I'm thinking Vice might be
a more appropriate assignment for him.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.358
Where does this bullshit come from?

15:17.398 --> 15:20.910
An all-white team knocking down doors in an
83% minority neighborhood is bad policy.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.838
We had a deal.

15:22.872 --> 15:25.198
I keep my nose clean
You keep your nose outta my business.

15:25.238 --> 15:28.142
Well, Shane didn't
keep his nose clean, did he?

15:28.182 --> 15:30.624
So we're gonna
find somebody who can…

15:30.677 --> 15:33.743
either a black or a Latino.

15:41.397 --> 15:44.717
–Feeling okay?
–Fine. Just a little office politics.

15:44.757 --> 15:46.546
What's the issue?

15:48.117 --> 15:50.511
–Actually, it's something you
might be able to help me with.
–Uh-huh?

15:50.551 --> 15:52.397
Aceveda's trying to ram something
down my throat.

15:52.437 --> 15:56.589
–You mean adding a minority
to your Strike Team?
–Yeah. That's right.

15:56.629 --> 15:59.117
Mm-hmm.
That was my idea.

15:59.317 --> 16:01.493
And it's a good one, in theory…

16:01.527 --> 16:04.973
but I don't have another spot open
on my squad.

16:05.269 --> 16:07.340
David told me
he was opening up a spot.

16:07.380 --> 16:10.380
–He was mistaken.
–Look. An all-white unit…

16:10.612 --> 16:12.909
smashing down doors
in a heavily minority neighborhood…

16:12.949 --> 16:16.249
It's just bad policy.
You'll get used to the idea.

16:23.092 --> 16:25.579
That's it exactly.

16:29.747 --> 16:31.241
Appreciate your tip.

16:31.315 --> 16:34.879
My men were able to clear
everything out just in time.

16:36.052 --> 16:38.445
–Here you are, gentlemen.
–How did the police know about it?

16:38.485 --> 16:42.571
–Seems like you pissed off
the wrong Lebanese Armenian.
–Hrach?

16:42.611 --> 16:46.220
Once he killed the jewel thief,
I guess he felt compelled to open up.

16:46.260 --> 16:49.323
–How do I shut him up?
–While he's in custody, you can't.

16:49.363 --> 16:51.305
Shit.

16:53.107 --> 16:55.083
How much to have him taken out?

16:55.123 --> 16:56.432
How you doing?

16:56.595 --> 16:58.318
What, killed?

16:58.515 --> 17:00.936
No. It's not possible.

17:01.107 --> 17:05.546
Not killed. Not killed. Just taken
out of jail. I'll deal with him myself.

17:05.586 --> 17:07.561
That'll cost you more than you have.

17:07.602 --> 17:09.969
Yeah, but, uh, it can be done.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.195
–It's possible.
–He's in custody for murder.

17:13.329 --> 17:15.786
Well, I am
the arresting officer.

17:17.233 --> 17:19.753
I suppose if I made a technical error…

17:19.954 --> 17:22.289
violated his rights somehow.

17:22.450 --> 17:26.759
Yeah, yeah.
How much to violate his rights?

17:29.777 --> 17:32.586
You want me to release a murderer
so that his mob boss can kill him?

17:32.626 --> 17:34.762
It sounded better the way
Vic explained it to me.

17:34.802 --> 17:36.809
We're not gonna
let Alex kill Hrach.

17:36.849 --> 17:40.489
–Oh. Well, that's a relief.
–We're gonna do it ourselves…

17:40.529 --> 17:42.409
or at least provide
a reasonable facsimile.

17:42.449 --> 17:44.172
All we need is a body.

17:47.537 --> 17:51.369
What do you want now, the keys to the
morgue? When does this stop?

17:51.409 --> 17:55.039
When we take Alex down.
Look, the only way to nail him…

17:55.217 --> 17:57.320
is to catch him
paying us off for the hit.

17:57.360 --> 18:01.037
–I'm pulling the plug.
–Alex needs to see a body.

18:01.233 --> 18:06.579
I mean, showing him a picture of some uni
in Halloween makeup isn't gonna cut it.

18:08.561 --> 18:11.208
If this ends in anything
but total success…

18:11.248 --> 18:13.157
you can join him on Vice.

18:17.552 --> 18:21.895
–What the hell's he talking about?
–Who knows?

18:25.968 --> 18:28.776
–It's a little clammy in here.
–You'll get used to it, Manny.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.816
–I won't need to.
–You fronted Richard Cummings
money for a restaurant…

18:31.856 --> 18:34.166
that closed after two weeks, right?

18:35.247 --> 18:37.607
I don't lend money.
I'm not a loan shark.

18:37.647 --> 18:41.127
–Cummings never paid you back.
–Why would he? I never lent him a dime.

18:41.167 --> 18:43.944
Lance Hinkle also owed you money…
a fortune.

18:43.984 --> 18:46.318
Don't know a Hinkle.

18:46.447 --> 18:48.999
You clear his debt.
He helps you kill Cummings.

18:49.039 --> 18:51.308
Sell it to the Grimms Brothers.

18:58.286 --> 19:00.199
I've got your lies on record.
Now sit there…

19:00.239 --> 19:02.660
while I prove them wrong.

19:02.830 --> 19:05.704
Take Bob and Marcy.
They lived next door to the victim.

19:05.744 --> 19:09.288
He had a prior for kidnapping,
liked young women. I should have seen it.

19:09.328 --> 19:11.175
Could you concentrate
on this case, please?

19:11.215 --> 19:14.383
I'm using it to illuminate this case.
Excuse me.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.710
It was Hinkle's gun.
Hinkle doesn't have an alibi.

19:16.750 --> 19:21.222
–It should be Hinkle.
–Hinkle's got nothing to do
with Cummings or the restaurant.

19:21.262 --> 19:23.142
What about the dead guy's wife?

19:23.182 --> 19:26.534
Maybe she and Hinkle, having an affair,
want the husband dead.

19:26.574 --> 19:29.158
The widow's got no insurance money.
She's not involved.

19:29.198 --> 19:31.237
–It's worth checking out.
–Look…

19:31.277 --> 19:33.765
I've got a suspect.
His name is Manny Sandoval.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.528
And I'm bringing him in.

19:35.725 --> 19:39.429
I'm having a hard time explaining why
we're backing you for city council…

19:39.469 --> 19:42.598
when you seem to be wholly unconcerned
with our community's needs.

19:42.638 --> 19:46.149
–What are we talking about here?
–A gang member died in
a drive-by shooting this week.

19:46.189 --> 19:49.062
His gang has demanded a funeral mass
at his family's church…

19:49.102 --> 19:51.874
but our new reverend
refused on principle.

19:55.053 --> 19:56.837
Since then, the church
has been vandalized…

19:56.877 --> 19:59.462
and he has received death threats.

20:01.036 --> 20:03.020
That's unacceptable.

20:03.054 --> 20:05.956
A community's strength
stems from its leaders…

20:05.996 --> 20:08.101
especially its spiritual ones.

20:08.236 --> 20:11.585
I'll assign a protection detail
immediately.

20:19.276 --> 20:22.404
Just got a suicide call.
White male, 20s, just blew his head off.

20:22.444 --> 20:25.942
Perfect. I'm gonna need
your clothes and your wallet.

20:30.859 --> 20:33.795
–What the hell is this?
–We found our candidate.

20:33.835 --> 20:35.875
–Who?
–Some guy.

20:36.011 --> 20:39.779
–What guy? Where?
–Dead guy. No face, no relatives, no problem.

20:39.819 --> 20:41.699
–I'm coming with.
–Sure. We'll meet you there.

20:41.739 --> 20:44.841
–What's the address?
–I think Cacuzza's got it.

20:46.155 --> 20:48.489
They're setting up.

20:48.651 --> 20:51.847
All right.
Set the camera up in here.

20:51.883 --> 20:54.435
Alex is on his way.
We got 15 minutes, tops.

20:54.475 --> 20:56.419
You know what? We'll, uh…
We'll take it from here.

20:56.459 --> 20:59.363
Yeah. We're not done
with the investigation.

21:00.395 --> 21:02.435
Time to swap out the clothes.

21:05.099 --> 21:07.714
–You said he blew his face off!
–That's what I was told!

21:07.754 --> 21:10.722
What did he do, miss?
He's totally recognizable!

21:10.762 --> 21:13.666
Jesus Christ.
He's gonna be here any minute.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.617
God.

21:16.810 --> 21:19.138
All right. Go… Go to my car
and get my shotgun.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.600
–What?
–Just do it!

21:26.825 --> 21:29.090
Don't worry.
You won't feel a thing.

21:29.130 --> 21:31.714
–I'll walk the neighborhood.
–What should I do?

21:31.754 --> 21:34.262
Stop anyone
from killing the reverend.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.531
Try to keep me in sight.

21:54.217 --> 21:56.802
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

21:57.001 --> 21:59.651
–Oh. Hi, Officer.
–Hi.

21:59.849 --> 22:02.241
–What are you doing?
–I know this looks weird…

22:02.281 --> 22:04.417
but I'm a volunteer coach
for a kids' soccer team.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.371
–Yeah. I see that.
–Well, uh…

22:06.377 --> 22:08.770
one of them found a squirrel
by the side of the road.

22:08.810 --> 22:10.881
It was the only way
to get him to stop crying.

22:10.921 --> 22:12.961
I promised to send it
to squirrel heaven.

22:13.001 --> 22:15.651
Okay. Well, that's not really legal.

22:15.848 --> 22:17.728
Well, I didn't know
what else to do.

22:17.768 --> 22:20.144
I just wanted Jordan
to feel better.

22:21.544 --> 22:26.148
Well, that's sweet.
Um, okay.

22:26.343 --> 22:28.732
Bury it deep.

22:28.904 --> 22:31.392
Thanks.

22:36.584 --> 22:39.620
–You wanna give him the face-lift?
–I'll pass.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.465
Pussy.

22:44.967 --> 22:47.520
You're not here to realize it…

22:47.719 --> 22:50.020
but you're doing a good thing.

22:56.966 --> 22:58.690
Yeah. That's better.

22:58.886 --> 23:00.828
Okay. Camera's got signal.

23:04.071 --> 23:06.754
–Oh, God.
–Where've you been?

23:06.918 --> 23:10.014
He gives you the money.
You give the signal. You get out.

23:10.054 --> 23:12.705
And hear me… this is it.
Understand?

23:12.902 --> 23:15.520
Sure.

23:21.510 --> 23:24.942
–When he gets the money,
we go… on my mark.
–Got it.

23:28.678 --> 23:31.166
–We gotta go.
–Thank you, sir.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.057
One of them yours?

23:33.253 --> 23:36.930
Hey. Um, no.
I used to play.

23:37.126 --> 23:40.606
–Bye.
–No. Most of these kids don't have fathers.

23:40.806 --> 23:42.748
That's very nice.

23:42.886 --> 23:45.536
We have a game on Sunday.

23:45.766 --> 23:48.802
Maybe if you're not working
you could stop by.

23:50.214 --> 23:53.115
Um, yeah, I'm free on Sunday.

23:53.253 --> 23:55.674
Great.

23:59.557 --> 24:01.280
You killed him yourself.

24:01.477 --> 24:03.228
Yeah. He got a little squirrelly.

24:03.268 --> 24:05.710
We're gonna have to
charge you extra…

24:05.732 --> 24:08.732
for saving you the trouble.
–All right. Here we go.

24:08.772 --> 24:11.804
–How much do you think he told them?
–We can find out.

24:11.844 --> 24:14.365
He was very involved
in a lot of my businesses.

24:14.405 --> 24:16.510
He knew a lot of things.

24:16.644 --> 24:19.746
Perhaps you can, uh,
help with some protection.

24:19.780 --> 24:21.209
Get ready.

24:24.708 --> 24:27.546
–Hold! Hold! Don't do this to me.
–Holding.

24:27.876 --> 24:31.934
–Like with what?
–Let's talk someplace else.

24:33.219 --> 24:35.041
Son of a bitch.

24:42.531 --> 24:45.915
I'd like to know if any more
of my places are going to be raided.

24:45.955 --> 24:48.443
Give me the addresses.
I'll check 'em out at my station.

24:48.483 --> 24:50.199
It'll take a couple hours.

24:50.211 --> 24:53.851
That's delicate information to give
to a police officer that I barely know.

24:53.891 --> 24:55.713
Fine.

24:55.811 --> 24:58.913
If you need me some other time,
give me a call.

24:59.523 --> 25:01.825
Hey. Wait.

25:01.987 --> 25:03.586
Hagop.

25:03.620 --> 25:06.459
Hagop knows the addresses.
He'll go with you.

25:06.499 --> 25:08.875
–Works for me.
–And he'll stay here.

25:10.626 --> 25:15.444
It's insurance, you know? You have
one of my men. I have one of your men.

25:18.722 --> 25:21.098
Make sure he doesn't catch anything.

25:21.122 --> 25:23.293
–See you soon.
–Yeah.

25:28.066 --> 25:29.855
Ahh.

25:31.490 --> 25:33.978
We believe one of these men
killed Richard.

25:34.018 --> 25:36.196
Claudette, I didn't see his face.

25:36.321 --> 25:38.558
He was running.

25:38.722 --> 25:41.209
Take a look.

25:42.882 --> 25:47.038
I'm sorry. I just…
I didn't see a face.

25:47.201 --> 25:49.306
–It was nine months ago.
–It's okay.

25:49.346 --> 25:51.788
There's one thing I don't understand.

25:51.873 --> 25:54.809
The night your husband was killed,
you were home alone with him?

25:54.849 --> 25:57.496
–That's right.
–You have two small children.

25:57.536 --> 26:01.209
It was a Wednesday night, middle of the
school week. Why weren't they in the house?

26:01.249 --> 26:03.930
Their grandmother takes them
ice-skating on Wednesday nights.

26:03.970 --> 26:07.160
They sleep over,
and then she drops them at school.

26:07.200 --> 26:10.936
It would be interesting if the killer
knew the kids wouldn't be in the house.

26:10.976 --> 26:14.936
Fewer possible witnesses…
or maybe to spare them the trauma…

26:15.009 --> 26:18.456
which is odd
unless the killer knew them personally.

26:18.624 --> 26:21.209
–Are you saying that I—
–Excuse me.

26:24.096 --> 26:25.623
Come here.

26:29.375 --> 26:31.776
What the hell are you doing?

26:31.809 --> 26:35.384
–Pursuing an angle of investigation.
–By attacking my witness?

26:35.424 --> 26:39.289
–She's not much of a witness.
–That's right. She's the victim.
I cleared her nine months ago.

26:39.329 --> 26:41.815
You cleared her of any connection
to Manny. What about Hinkle?

26:41.855 --> 26:44.479
She's not in this.

26:44.512 --> 26:47.031
–Maybe it's just that simple.
–Goddamn it.

26:47.071 --> 26:48.827
She's not Marcy.

26:49.023 --> 26:52.634
Now, you screwed up your case.
Fine. It happens.

26:52.831 --> 26:55.514
But don't screw up mine.

26:55.711 --> 26:58.166
–Take that back.
–Later.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.611
Right now,
I'm handling this case.

27:00.671 --> 27:02.427
Alone.

27:10.847 --> 27:15.797
Cummings's wife saw you outside the house
the night you killed her husband.

27:16.510 --> 27:18.681
She just positively ID'd you.

27:20.350 --> 27:22.651
You're done.

27:34.557 --> 27:37.461
Hinkle spilled his guts
like a cheap piñata.

27:37.471 --> 27:40.311
How you'd excuse the vig on his loan
in exchange for killing Cummings.

27:40.351 --> 27:43.861
Not the principle, though.
Tsk tsk. You're a piece of work.

27:43.901 --> 27:45.683
It's his word against mine.

27:45.789 --> 27:50.426
Believe me. When he's on that stand,
and his little girl's there…

27:50.621 --> 27:52.988
and he's bawling like a baby…

27:53.149 --> 27:55.855
they're gonna believe
every word he says.

27:59.964 --> 28:03.161
I don't need a confession.

28:03.325 --> 28:05.113
Take him.

28:08.572 --> 28:11.507
Let's go.

28:11.644 --> 28:15.736
They could still be undercover.
They could be doing God knows…

28:16.956 --> 28:18.963
Never mind.

28:19.100 --> 28:21.844
Nothing. I guess he didn't
squeal on that one.

28:21.884 --> 28:23.608
What's the next address?

28:23.804 --> 28:25.627
4103 Merrick.

28:25.820 --> 28:28.406
And this is?

28:28.604 --> 28:30.743
Cigarettes, tax-free.

28:30.939 --> 28:35.761
Well, your smokers can cough up
their lungs in peace. Next address.

28:35.835 --> 28:37.748
This one's not really anything…

28:37.788 --> 28:40.308
but since we're here,
check it anyway.

28:40.507 --> 28:44.250
–Sure. Give it to me.
–9210 Escovida.

28:44.443 --> 28:46.964
And this is?

28:47.163 --> 28:51.222
Not sure.
Storage or something.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.587
–It's clear.
–Where the hell you been?

28:53.627 --> 28:56.823
I'm working on another case.
What'd you expect?

28:56.987 --> 29:00.213
–You disappeared. Where's Shane?
–He's working on that hooker sting
I told you about.

29:00.253 --> 29:04.402
Hooker sting? What do they have you
doing now, entrapping johns?

29:04.442 --> 29:06.290
He's just talking with them.

29:06.362 --> 29:08.729
Might bring in a few of them later.

29:08.923 --> 29:11.859
Well, you're supposed to
check in every two hours.

29:11.899 --> 29:13.808
Make sure you do.

29:16.603 --> 29:20.146
Asshole's just trying to keep his job.
It's pathetic. Next?

29:20.186 --> 29:23.896
–Hrach?
–Hagop?

29:24.090 --> 29:25.846
–Oh, shit.
–You're alive.

29:28.025 --> 29:31.506
–What's going on?
–You need help here?

29:33.241 --> 29:35.991
All right. Let's go.

29:37.369 --> 29:40.562
What time were you supposed
to check in with Alex?

29:40.602 --> 29:43.220
What happens to Shane
if you don't?

29:50.554 --> 29:52.855
I'm out. I'm out.

29:52.921 --> 29:56.369
Ha. I beat him anyway.

29:58.457 --> 30:02.319
Instead of playing poker,
we should be playing poke her.

30:03.513 --> 30:06.611
–Wanna play another one?
–Yeah.

30:09.146 --> 30:13.297
In exactly 10 seconds go to the John.
Now say, “wrong number” and hang up.

30:13.337 --> 30:14.962
Wrong number.

30:26.392 --> 30:28.944
Tell you what. This gypsy swill
just goes right through me.

30:28.984 --> 30:30.772
Be right back.

31:07.639 --> 31:09.100
Stay still, asshole.

31:10.710 --> 31:15.053
Everybody down! Come on! Everybody!
Down! On the floor!

31:15.223 --> 31:19.314
–Get down on the ground!
–You get on the floor! Get down!

31:19.479 --> 31:21.617
–You too!
–Get your hands up!

31:23.414 --> 31:27.308
Lace your hands, put your palms
on top of your head. Do it!

31:27.318 --> 31:29.684
Alex Eznik, you're under arrest.

31:29.845 --> 31:33.009
Shane! Take him. Shane!

31:34.230 --> 31:35.953
–Shane!
–Yeah.

31:37.173 --> 31:40.272
How 'bout next time I save your ass?

31:40.630 --> 31:43.085
That's a date.

31:44.213 --> 31:46.445
–Anything I need to know?
–Nothing at all.

31:46.485 --> 31:48.274
Yeah.

32:02.293 --> 32:05.009
What are you doing?

32:05.204 --> 32:09.197
Oh, hi.
Um, I'm burying a hamster.

32:09.333 --> 32:12.911
Did you just pay that kid for it?

32:13.044 --> 32:17.004
No. I gave him some money
so that he could go buy a new one.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.916
Okay. You know what?
I'm going to have to write you up for this.

32:31.956 --> 32:34.705
–No. You don't.
–Yeah. I do.

32:34.900 --> 32:37.078
–Look. It's really not…
–Shut up.

32:38.515 --> 32:40.239
Jesus Christ.

32:40.435 --> 32:43.867
All right, ladies.
Move it along. Come on. Let's go.

32:44.819 --> 32:46.827
–Nice bust.
–Oh, it's not over yet.

32:46.867 --> 32:49.035
Once these goons lawyer up,
the word'll get out…

32:49.075 --> 32:51.115
and those places will be cleared out
before we can hit 'em.

32:51.155 --> 32:54.475
So let's move now.
Give me the specifics. I'll send units.

32:54.515 --> 32:57.548
We got a chop shop on Newman.
Cigarette stash on Merrick. A few others.

32:57.588 --> 32:59.659
Uh, something mysterious
on Escovida.

32:59.699 --> 33:02.092
–We'll check that out.
–Something to do with the money train?

33:02.132 --> 33:05.432
It's probably just a jerk-off.
We'll let you know.

33:26.706 --> 33:29.127
Do you think
that's the money train?

33:29.298 --> 33:31.146
I got a pretty good feeling.

33:31.218 --> 33:32.941
So it is real.

33:43.154 --> 33:45.739
What do
you wanna do?

33:45.938 --> 33:50.217
At the bar, when I didn't
answer her questions, she called me names.

33:50.257 --> 33:52.777
Why didn't you report this earlier?

33:52.977 --> 33:54.857
I don't know.
I didn't know my rights.

33:54.897 --> 33:56.871
But you do now.

34:01.809 --> 34:04.383
Mr Ibish, do you remember
Officer Lowe?

34:04.656 --> 34:07.120
–Yes.
–I remember you too.

34:07.154 --> 34:10.792
My first week on the job.
He resisted arrest, became violent.

34:10.831 --> 34:13.360
My partner exercised
great restraint.

34:13.393 --> 34:16.199
–Did Danny use any racial epithets?
–No, sir.

34:16.239 --> 34:18.408
But Mr Ibish used one or two
towards me.

34:18.447 --> 34:21.813
He's lying. He's covering for her.
You all do that.

34:21.967 --> 34:25.864
What did Mr Hamad offer you
to come forward with this story?

34:25.904 --> 34:28.616
If he's retracting his statements now,
it's a surprise to me.

34:28.656 --> 34:32.712
You told him that if he filed a complaint, you'd
represent him for free in his own civil suit.

34:32.752 --> 34:36.391
That was predicated on his story being true.
There was no quid pro quo for him to lie.

34:36.431 --> 34:39.366
Well, either way,
your case ends here.

34:39.504 --> 34:42.726
Our case doesn't depend on him.
I'm here to discuss your counteroffer.

34:42.766 --> 34:44.806
Well, here it is: nothing.

34:44.943 --> 34:48.009
Her own partner won't
corroborate her story.

34:48.143 --> 34:50.663
–He doesn't contradict it either.
–We have a wrongful entry…

34:50.703 --> 34:52.902
an innocent man,
and a grieving widow.

34:52.943 --> 34:57.799
And I've got a decorated officer
who's fighting to keep this city
safe during very troubled times.

34:57.839 --> 35:00.413
I look forward to a jury
settling this.

35:04.526 --> 35:06.730
We'll be in touch.

35:23.311 --> 35:25.902
Washington, Oregon,
Arizona, Nevada.

35:25.935 --> 35:30.118
This isn't just L.A money.
This is the whole goddamn West Coast.

35:30.158 --> 35:31.881
Holy shit.

35:32.046 --> 35:34.150
First the head of the Zeroun family,
then this.

35:34.190 --> 35:37.490
Aceveda's gonna be
licking our scrotums for weeks.

35:37.806 --> 35:40.489
I'll call, uh…
I'll call for backup.

35:40.686 --> 35:43.435
–No.
–What?

35:44.589 --> 35:47.818
–We're gonna let it go.
–Why?

35:47.981 --> 35:49.770
We're gonna let it go.

36:05.196 --> 36:08.098
Get over here.

36:08.236 --> 36:10.309
Get over here.

36:17.356 --> 36:19.460
–Tell that bitch you lied.
–What?

36:19.500 --> 36:24.120
Tell her you made it up because
you owed me money, wanted to get even.

36:24.940 --> 36:28.071
I can't lie anymore.

36:28.204 --> 36:32.676
I got you to take out Cummings.
You don't think I can arrange
to have your daughter be next?

36:32.716 --> 36:34.504
Use your head.

36:42.028 --> 36:44.166
I didn't need a confession.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.321
But it doesn't hurt.

37:06.027 --> 37:08.678
Hey, Vic.
We hit the mother lode.

37:08.843 --> 37:11.298
Credit cards, digital cameras,
phony passports.

37:11.338 --> 37:13.252
–What did you find?
–Nothing.

37:13.260 --> 37:15.106
You're the only one
who came up empty?

37:15.146 --> 37:18.116
A case of frostbite,
but, uh, no money train.

37:18.890 --> 37:21.122
You think he gave you
the wrong information?

37:21.162 --> 37:23.530
Either that or it never existed.

37:23.564 --> 37:25.794
What's the matter?
Cage not full enough for you?

37:25.834 --> 37:28.289
So you won't mind
if I check it out.

37:32.809 --> 37:34.598
Why would I mind?

37:41.130 --> 37:42.918
Good work today.

37:49.226 --> 37:53.349
–Good enough to get a chit with you?
–What kind of chit?

37:53.449 --> 37:57.343
I'll take a minority onto my team,
but I get to keep Shane.

37:57.449 --> 38:00.199
Hmm.

38:01.449 --> 38:03.369
He's suspended for a week…

38:03.403 --> 38:06.016
and I get approval
of the new team member.

38:06.056 --> 38:08.366
And I get to approve your approval.

38:10.089 --> 38:12.194
I can live with that.

38:12.328 --> 38:14.308
Then I guess we start lookin'.

38:21.001 --> 38:24.416
–I take it back.
–No need to. You were right.

38:26.792 --> 38:28.672
Hey. Let me buy you a little dinner.

38:28.712 --> 38:31.327
A detective can't personalize
his investigations.

38:31.367 --> 38:34.564
I'm, uh…
I'm not really very hungry.

38:38.087 --> 38:41.920
–Hrach says the money train moves
every couple of months.
–Where does it go?

38:41.960 --> 38:44.677
Next time?
Right into our pockets.

38:44.904 --> 38:47.359
Oh. There's a lot of unknowns.

38:47.528 --> 38:50.626
Well, we can do it right…
be extra careful…

38:50.760 --> 38:52.221
take our time.

38:52.391 --> 38:55.555
You can't really be talkin'
about making off…

38:55.751 --> 38:59.329
with the Armenian mob's
entire Western U.S kitty.

38:59.495 --> 39:03.587
Goddamn Eastern Euros can't
keep track of their own plutonium.

39:03.815 --> 39:06.943
You think I'm gonna trust 'em
with our cold hard cash?

39:06.983 --> 39:09.285
Huh?

39:15.078 --> 39:16.728
Mr Hamad dropped my case.

39:16.806 --> 39:18.984
One big city against just me now.

39:19.014 --> 39:21.406
Mrs Al-Thani, please. I don't wanna
have to put you under arrest.

39:21.446 --> 39:25.723
You! Zayed was a good man!
He would never shoot you!

39:25.894 --> 39:27.776
And we sympathize
with your loss.

39:27.816 --> 39:29.662
If you did, you would have
signed those papers…

39:29.702 --> 39:32.606
and given me peace
and a chance for my baby.

39:32.902 --> 39:35.174
Come. Come here.

39:35.208 --> 39:38.178
He will never know his father
because of you.

39:39.398 --> 39:41.569
I'll never forget what you do.

39:41.701 --> 39:43.970
I didn't do anything wrong.

39:44.133 --> 39:46.238
Justice will find you.

39:57.317 --> 39:59.581
Now, you have a king.
She only has a four…

39:59.621 --> 40:01.533
which means you can take her cards.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.777
See? These cards go over here.

40:03.909 --> 40:06.843
Go ahead.
Move these cards over here.

40:09.509 --> 40:12.092
–Matthew?
–You just have to show him, Dad.

40:12.132 --> 40:13.921
Here.

40:16.901 --> 40:18.875
Birthday cake? Vic.

40:19.012 --> 40:21.500
Well, it's somebody's
birthday… somewhere.

40:21.540 --> 40:23.741
It's time to get ready for bed.
Come on.

40:23.781 --> 40:26.355
Go brush your teeth,
put on your p.j's.

40:26.468 --> 40:28.604
–I'm not tired.
–Hey. You heard your mom.

40:28.644 --> 40:31.482
I'll be in in a second
to read you a story.

40:32.196 --> 40:34.716
Go on.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.395
Megan went right to sleep.
No problem.

40:38.435 --> 40:41.599
–How are you feeling?
–Ah. A little stiff.

40:41.731 --> 40:43.641
I'm okay, not too bad.

40:44.836 --> 40:46.974
First day back at work was good.

40:47.107 --> 40:48.987
It's a little early, isn't it?

40:49.027 --> 40:52.443
These doctors. If they could,
they'd put you on bed rest…

40:52.483 --> 40:55.067
until you got something else
they could charge you for.

40:55.107 --> 40:57.757
You seemed pretty anxious
to get back.

40:57.955 --> 41:00.474
–I have a lot to do.
–Uh, it's just that…

41:00.514 --> 41:03.198
before you got hurt, you, uh…

41:03.394 --> 41:05.440
you said you'd leave the house.

41:06.626 --> 41:09.244
You promised.

41:11.074 --> 41:12.896
I know.

41:13.091 --> 41:16.061
If you're good enough
to go back to work, um…

41:17.410 --> 41:19.324
Soon as you can find a place.

41:33.378 --> 41:35.833
What can I do for ya?

41:36.002 --> 41:38.489
–I need a room.
–Oh, yeah.

41:44.129 --> 41:47.129
Oh. Um, you know what?
That's fine.

41:47.201 --> 41:52.023
Here. Um, just write your name
and, uh, your police division.

41:54.689 --> 41:57.049
Hey. Is this about
the people across the street?

41:57.089 --> 41:58.813
Hmm?

41:59.009 --> 42:01.253
–I can't say.
–Okay. Yeah. That's…

42:01.409 --> 42:03.132
I understand.

42:03.329 --> 42:06.776
I tell ya. The things
he does to her… it's a sin.

42:06.945 --> 42:10.839
Why don't you give me a room
with a view across the street?

42:19.937 --> 42:22.313
You know,
I might be staying awhile.

42:47.776 --> 42:49.467
Ahh.
