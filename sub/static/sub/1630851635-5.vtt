I just need,

00:39.122 --> 00:41.541
- Miss Rojas,
I think we can both agree

00:41.583 --> 00:43.084
that you've exhausted
the potential

00:43.126 --> 00:44.336

- Okay, okay.

I know, but I just--
I just have

00:45.712 --> 00:47.756
to get this perfect,
or it's gonna drive me nuts.

00:47.797 --> 00:51.384
- Okay, let me see
if I can find a janitor.

It was a mistake

but I swear
we weren't discussing the case.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.403
It's just been
a roller coaster,

Cheating's nothing

to be honest with me.

So is this post true?

01:43.561 --> 01:45.814
- I studied hard.
That's all.

01:45.855 --> 01:49.109
- According to Simon's peers,
he rarely got things wrong.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.443
- He didn't post that.

- No, but we have reason
to believe

when it comes to my academics,

02:12.507 --> 02:14.801

that I would harm someone

it's preposterous.

Should I know?
Should I know that Keely knew?

Do not bring up Keely.

into this any more

to something false,

to help you, protect you?

It's like two sentences.

when this post dropped?

- No, the timestamp, 3:13 p.m.
That's three hours ahead.

changed it somehow,

11:59.469 --> 12:00.428

with Nate or Bronwyn.

I need to ask you

12:19.948 --> 12:22.909

12:22.951 --> 12:24.744
And if you'd like,
you and I

12:24.786 --> 12:26.329
could speak privately first.

about this bullshit rumor

in the parking lot?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.846

a young man you were with.

He's 6'1", African American.
You seemed to be arguing.

12:50.145 --> 12:53.648
- Um, I met a lot
of people that day.

12:53.690 --> 12:56.109
- Well, this was
someone your age.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.611
Someone you're
involved with maybe?

12:58.653 --> 13:01.448

Yeah, I think you're mixed up.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.284

- Why?

13:04.325 --> 13:06.369

before Simon Kelleher died,

13:06.411 --> 13:08.455
he intended to out you
to your peers.

We know that somebody
changed the post Simon wrote

13:10.957 --> 13:13.168
after his death.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.962
Yours was the only one
that was altered.

We're talking all of
your family's financial woes

to the police,

might try to talk to you.

22:29.182 --> 22:31.518
- I was just trying to--
- Protect me?

22:31.559 --> 22:33.520
Yeah, I know.

22:33.561 --> 22:37.148
- No, not just you.
Mom, Dad.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.359
They're not as strong
as you think they are.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.027
They would keep it together
at the hospital,

22:41.069 --> 22:43.154
then come home
and fall fucking apart.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.989
Do you have any idea
what it does to them?

22:45.031 --> 22:46.866
They cannot handle
one more crisis.

22:46.908 --> 22:49.035
- Yeah?
How about you going to prison?

22:49.077 --> 22:50.954
Do you think
that's gonna make them happy?

22:50.995 --> 22:53.998
Tell them the truth.
- That won't make a difference.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.167
I still threatened Simon.
It's on tape.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.670
At least this way,
they still have one daughter

22:58.712 --> 23:00.880
who's not a total fuckup.

23:05.802 --> 23:06.803
[door slams]

23:06.845 --> 23:08.346
- Whatever.

23:08.388 --> 23:11.141
At least there isn't a video
of you getting in Simon's face

23:11.182 --> 23:13.101
and threatening to kill him.

23:13.143 --> 23:16.938
So she saw you with some guy?
Why is that even relevant?

23:16.980 --> 23:18.857
- Because she thinks
I hacked into the app

23:18.898 --> 23:20.316
and changed the post.

23:20.358 --> 23:25.238
I mean, it is weird, right?
Who else would do that?

23:25.280 --> 23:29.993
* *

23:30.035 --> 23:32.328
- If it was Keely,
starting a rumor

23:32.370 --> 23:34.706
Cooper's doping
isn't exactly without risk.

23:34.748 --> 23:36.666
- Not if she knew
he could pass a test.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.335
- Why post anything
about him at all?

23:38.376 --> 23:40.170
- Because he was
in the room with us.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.546
- Maybe she thought
that no post would look

23:41.588 --> 23:43.089
even more suspicious.

23:43.131 --> 23:47.218
- What did Cooper say?
- That I'm being paranoid.

23:47.260 --> 23:50.972
Which, like, obviously.
We're being stalked.

23:51.014 --> 23:53.099
I'm about to be interrogated
by a police officer

23:53.141 --> 23:54.642
threatening to arrest me.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.311
- They don't actually think
you did it, though.

23:56.353 --> 23:59.230
No one does.
- Why is that?

23:59.272 --> 24:00.899
The fact that everybody
writes me off

24:00.940 --> 24:03.985
is kind of offensive
and definitely sexist.

24:04.027 --> 24:06.237
I could totally be a killer,
and I'd be

24:06.279 --> 24:08.073
the most dangerous one
because no one

24:08.114 --> 24:11.785
would see it coming.
- Mm-hmm, I'm so scared.

24:11.826 --> 24:14.245
[laughter]

24:14.287 --> 24:16.581
- Holy crap.
It's after 11:00?

24:16.623 --> 24:18.333
- Oh, no, no,
I keep it on New York time

24:18.375 --> 24:19.834
when my dad's there
'cause he hates

24:19.876 --> 24:21.586
when I call after he's in bed.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.380
[ominous music]

24:23.421 --> 24:25.465
I mean, it's only, like,
three hours ahead.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.842
[uneasy music]

24:27.884 --> 24:29.803
Are you okay?

24:30.804 --> 24:32.389
- What?
Yeah.

24:32.430 --> 24:36.267
Um, I'm just tired.

24:36.309 --> 24:39.229
Do you have coffee?
I need some caffeine.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.689
- Yeah.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.440
Um, I've got French roast,
I think.

24:42.482 --> 24:45.902
I don't have anything
pumpkin spice.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.446
- I actually like it black.
- Cool, me too.

24:48.488 --> 24:52.409
- Uh, with oat milk
if you have it and sugar.

24:52.450 --> 24:54.411
I like it
with, um, brown sugar.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.496
- A murderer
would take it black.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.957
[chuckles]

24:58.998 --> 25:06.131
* *

25:42.417 --> 25:43.585
- Hey.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.881
What are you doing?
Wait, is that my computer?

25:49.716 --> 25:51.926
- Just so you know, my phone
is tracking my location,

25:51.968 --> 25:53.720
so if I'm gonna
end up like Simon--

25:53.762 --> 25:57.307
- You think I killed him?
He was my only friend.

25:57.349 --> 26:01.019
- I know
you guys were fighting.

26:01.061 --> 26:02.979
You must
have known his passwords,

26:03.021 --> 26:05.357
so you posted
all of our secrets

26:05.398 --> 26:07.942
to give us motive for
the murder that you committed.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.736
You posted them
from your laptop,

26:09.778 --> 26:12.030
which is why they were
timestamped three hours

26:12.072 --> 26:14.574
after they actually dropped.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.868
Let's see what
the police think about that.

26:16.910 --> 26:18.244
- Fine, you're right.

26:18.286 --> 26:19.829
I did post them,
but only the first ones,

26:19.871 --> 26:21.873
and I just wanted the police
to know you had motive

26:21.915 --> 26:24.084
'cause I was sure
one of you did it.

26:24.125 --> 26:27.337
- That post
ruined my life, Janae.

26:27.379 --> 26:30.131
- Did it?

26:30.173 --> 26:31.299
You never would have broken up

26:31.341 --> 26:32.676
with that little shit
otherwise,

26:32.717 --> 26:35.220
or your friend Vanessa
who wouldn't shut up

26:35.261 --> 26:37.055
about the peanut oil
in your locker.

26:37.097 --> 26:39.474
That's how I found out.

26:39.516 --> 26:42.394
Look, I knew
it would have consequences.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.979
That's why I changed
Cooper's secret.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.606
I'm not gonna out him.

26:48.566 --> 26:50.193
I'm not a monster.

26:52.654 --> 26:53.863
Addy, you're bleeding.

26:53.905 --> 26:55.156
- Let me go,
or I swear to God...

26:55.198 --> 26:56.658
- I didn't post
the photo of the four of you

26:56.700 --> 26:58.118
or the video of Bronwyn,

26:58.159 --> 26:59.786
and I obviously
did not kill him.

26:59.828 --> 27:02.247
You can check the timestamps
if you don't believe me.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.499
Somebody got into the app
and locked me out.

27:04.541 --> 27:05.500
I tried logging in,

27:05.542 --> 27:07.127
and they changed
all the passwords,

27:07.168 --> 27:09.546
and then this creepy
pop-up message came up.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.923
There is
someone else out there.

27:11.965 --> 27:15.427
Whoever's following you guys,
that is who killed Simon.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.345
Addy, come on.

27:17.387 --> 27:19.597
Can you please believe me?

27:19.639 --> 27:20.765
- [quavering]

27:20.807 --> 27:22.183
- Please?

27:31.443 --> 27:33.695
- We got a call
from the detective.

27:35.030 --> 27:37.198
They want you to come in
for questioning.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.994
Nate, we're running
out of time.

27:42.996 --> 27:46.458
- I'm not leaving.
I can't.

27:46.499 --> 27:49.085
- You deserve a second chance.
You hear me?

27:50.420 --> 27:53.506
[quiet dramatic music]

27:53.548 --> 27:55.133
* *

27:55.175 --> 27:57.761
- You think I did it, right?

28:00.430 --> 28:03.099
That's why you're so convinced
the cops will arrest me.

28:05.018 --> 28:08.104
Not 'cause
they're lazy or corrupt.

28:08.146 --> 28:10.065
It's 'cause
you actually think--

28:10.106 --> 28:12.984
- I don't have
the right to ask.

28:13.026 --> 28:14.778
I gave that up.

28:14.819 --> 28:18.365
But if you did something,

28:18.406 --> 28:21.409
then it's my fault, not yours,

28:21.451 --> 28:24.746
and you don't need to spend
your life punishing yourself.

28:24.788 --> 28:27.457
Hell, what do you call
the past six years, huh?

28:27.499 --> 28:30.418
Why not chalk it up
to time served?

28:30.460 --> 28:31.503
Nate?

28:35.215 --> 28:36.633
[door buzzes]

28:39.719 --> 28:41.096
- Thank you.

28:41.137 --> 28:43.014
- I like the hair.

28:43.056 --> 28:45.058
- It's a choice.

28:46.685 --> 28:50.772
- So, Addy, what can you
tell me about Cooper Clay?

28:50.814 --> 28:54.192
- Cooper?
I don't know.

28:54.234 --> 28:56.069
He's nice.

28:56.111 --> 28:59.906
- [chuckles]
Okay.

28:59.948 --> 29:02.242
Do these
look familiar to you?

29:02.283 --> 29:05.870
We recently obtained a copy
of Simon's hard drive,

29:05.912 --> 29:09.040
which allows us to compare
these original posts

29:09.082 --> 29:12.502
with some of the unpublished
drafts Simon had saved.

29:12.544 --> 29:14.379
Now three of them
are identical,

29:14.421 --> 29:17.257
but Cooper's is not,
so we think whoever loaded

29:17.298 --> 29:20.176
these onto the app
decided to rewrite his.

29:20.218 --> 29:21.845
- It wasn't him.

29:21.886 --> 29:23.388
- Well, who was it then?

29:28.351 --> 29:30.061
- I don't know.

29:30.103 --> 29:33.064
- Has Cooper ever talked to you
about Simon Kelleher's laptop?

29:33.106 --> 29:34.566
You ever see him with it?

29:34.607 --> 29:36.359
'Cause we think that's
maybe how he rewrote the post,

29:36.401 --> 29:39.571
using the laptop.
- Cooper didn't do that.

29:39.612 --> 29:42.115
- Addy, I can see
you're really trusting.

29:42.157 --> 29:43.908
You're really loyal.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.410
- She really is.

29:45.452 --> 29:47.871
Any of those kids could be
playing her like a fiddle.

29:47.912 --> 29:49.581
- Addy, you got to understand,

29:49.622 --> 29:51.458
these kids
are not your friends.

29:51.499 --> 29:54.461
One or more of them
was involved in Simon's death,

29:54.502 --> 29:58.631
and that's not the only crime
I have to look into here.

29:58.673 --> 30:01.301
Are you familiar with the term
obstruction of justice?

30:03.845 --> 30:05.722
Well, then you understand
that if you withhold

30:05.764 --> 30:08.850
any pertinent information,
you're guilty of a crime,

30:08.892 --> 30:11.311
whether or not you are involved
in Simon's death.

30:11.353 --> 30:15.273
- Baby, do you know something?

30:15.315 --> 30:18.568
[dramatic music]

30:18.610 --> 30:20.779
- Addy, we've seen pictures

30:20.820 --> 30:22.614
of you
and your little secret society.

30:22.655 --> 30:25.450
Is one of them
coercing you to lie?

30:25.492 --> 30:29.371
We know about one troubling
incident in Cooper's past.

30:29.412 --> 30:31.206
Is he threatening you?

30:31.247 --> 30:33.541
Is he forcing you
to lie about the laptop?

30:33.583 --> 30:35.919
We need to know, Addy.
- Bronwyn had the laptop.

30:38.922 --> 30:41.633
- Did you see her with it?

30:41.675 --> 30:43.259
- No.

30:43.301 --> 30:48.932
* *

30:48.973 --> 30:50.392
But Nate Macauley did.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.185
* *

30:57.607 --> 30:58.817
["Diamonds and Bands"]

30:58.858 --> 31:00.235
- * I said I hit
the elevator *

31:00.276 --> 31:01.194
* Made it to the top *

31:01.236 --> 31:03.238
- Quite the turnout.

31:03.279 --> 31:05.782
- Yeah, I don't think
they're here for us, though.

31:05.824 --> 31:07.409
- * 'Cause I ain't you *

31:07.450 --> 31:10.078
* And if I wasn't myself
I'd probably hate me too *

31:10.120 --> 31:12.997
* My boyfriend best friend
wanna date me too *

31:13.039 --> 31:15.125
* Looked in the mirror, saw
ain't nothing I can't do *

31:15.166 --> 31:16.835
[phone buzzing]

31:16.876 --> 31:18.670
- * Savage,
ain't nothing average *

31:18.712 --> 31:20.046
* All about my green *

31:20.088 --> 31:21.798
- I'll be right back.

31:21.840 --> 31:24.467
- * Bad bitch, savage,
ain't nothing average *

31:24.509 --> 31:25.969
* Playing with my money *

31:26.011 --> 31:27.470
* We gonna pull up
at your address... *

31:27.512 --> 31:31.141
- Hey, we're about to compete.
What's up?

31:31.182 --> 31:32.642
- I'm afraid this can't wait.

31:32.684 --> 31:34.811
I just spoke to a friend
in the department,

31:34.853 --> 31:36.980
and apparently Addy Prentiss

31:37.022 --> 31:39.065
is saying that you
and Nate Macauley

31:39.107 --> 31:41.985
were in possession
of Simon's laptop.

31:42.027 --> 31:44.070
- Wait, what?

31:44.112 --> 31:46.740
- We need to have
a serious chat tonight.

31:46.781 --> 31:48.783
- Thank you all.
And welcome.

31:48.825 --> 31:50.910
- Okay.
I--I have to go.

31:52.996 --> 31:55.749
- As always,
we strive to choose topics

31:55.790 --> 31:58.335
of real impact
on today's youth.

31:58.376 --> 32:00.920
And today's resolution is:

32:00.962 --> 32:03.214
"Instances
of high school bullying

32:03.256 --> 32:06.134
"are as pernicious
as acts of physical violence

32:06.176 --> 32:08.720
and should be
penalized accordingly."

32:08.762 --> 32:10.513
Arguing the affirmative will be

32:10.555 --> 32:13.266
Laguna South High School's
Alex Ross.

32:13.308 --> 32:14.517
The negative will be argued

32:14.559 --> 32:18.146
by Bayview High School's
Bronwyn Rojas.

32:18.188 --> 32:19.731
Mr. Ross.

32:19.773 --> 32:23.360
- Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.
Thank you.

32:23.401 --> 32:25.528
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:25.570 --> 32:29.741
the goal of any
educational administration...

32:29.783 --> 32:32.535
- Bronwyn.
How are you?

32:32.577 --> 32:34.996
- What the fuck is wrong
with you, Simon?

32:35.038 --> 32:36.998
I don't know how the hell
you got her to send the photos.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.667
I don't know who else
you're trying to target.

32:38.708 --> 32:41.461
I don't give a shit.
I'll tell you this though.

32:41.503 --> 32:43.713
Possession of child pornography
in the state of California

32:43.755 --> 32:46.633
is a felony, penal code 311,
and the fact

32:46.675 --> 32:48.677
that you are a minor
does not exempt you from it.

32:48.718 --> 32:50.387
So unless you want to be
registered as a sex offender

32:50.428 --> 32:51.638
for the rest of your life,

32:51.680 --> 32:54.349
I suggest you delete
the photos right now

32:54.391 --> 32:56.768
and stay the fuck
away from Maeve

32:56.810 --> 33:00.939
or I'll fucking kill you.
Do you understand?

33:00.980 --> 33:03.858
[tense music]

33:03.900 --> 33:07.821
- I know you cheated.
I was gonna let it slide.

33:07.862 --> 33:10.490
Do your whole family a solid.

33:12.826 --> 33:16.121
But, yeah,
I'll leave Maeve alone.

33:16.162 --> 33:19.207
