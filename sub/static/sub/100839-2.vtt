00:14.681 --> 00:16.266
Hi, Ben.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.308
Hey.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.270
[under breath] Who the fuck is Ben?

00:20.353 --> 00:22.814
Um... I'm the fuck is Ben.

00:22.897 --> 00:23.732
What?

00:23.815 --> 00:25.316
Jen, this is Steve's brother.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.360
What the fuck, Steve has a twin brother?

00:27.444 --> 00:28.695
-[Judy] He does.
-He do.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.656
Steve has an identical twin brother?

00:31.740 --> 00:33.324
-They're not identical.
-We're not actually identical.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.659
-We're semi-identical.
-Semi-identical.

00:34.743 --> 00:35.869
Oh, you're semi-identical.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.620
Yeah, so two sperm, one egg.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.081
Like a double yolk,
only the sperm is the yolk.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.000
Does that make sense?

00:44.085 --> 00:45.545
[whispers] Am I dead? Did I die?

00:46.713 --> 00:49.841
I don't think so.
I mean, unless we're all dead.

00:49.924 --> 00:53.136
-[gasps]
-[laughing] Nobody's dead. No. We're not.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.512
Nobody's dead.

00:55.889 --> 00:56.723
-Okay.
-[sighs]

00:57.515 --> 00:59.434
-Are you all right?
-Mm-hmm.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.145
-[thuds]
-[Judy shouts]

01:02.228 --> 01:04.230
[Jen panting]

01:05.106 --> 01:08.026
Hey, hey. You okay?

01:08.693 --> 01:09.778
[Jen] Yeah, I'm fine.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.654
You don't seem fine. You fainted.

01:12.113 --> 01:13.281
And you look a little upset.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.701
That's just my face. I have an upset face.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.079
No, it's a fine face. It's a good face.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.498
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.666
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I'm fine.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.086
The fainting could be
a blood pressure thing.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.879
Yeah. Ben's a doctor.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.006
Chiropractor.
And I'm gonna beat you to the punch.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.258
We are actual doctors,
and we got your back.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.596
Um, have you been under any stress lately?

01:36.971 --> 01:39.432
-[Judy scoffs] Um...
-No, why would I be...

01:39.516 --> 01:40.934
-Nah.
-Like, just the minimal...

01:41.017 --> 01:42.727
-Maybe a smidge.
-...stuff like political landscape...

01:42.811 --> 01:44.521
-Weight of the world...
-...global warming.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.022
-Everybody's feeling it.
-Um...

01:46.106 --> 01:47.524
-But no.
-Little bit.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.025
-All good.
-Yeah.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.360
Coolio.

01:51.569 --> 01:54.447
Can I just back up here?
Why are you here?

01:55.115 --> 01:58.785
Oh, right. I'm sorry,
I just barged in, didn't I? Um...

01:58.868 --> 02:02.247
[sighs] Judy, I tried you.
Steve's missing, and so is his car,

02:02.330 --> 02:03.998
and he usually calls our mom every night,

02:04.082 --> 02:06.626
and she hasn't heard from him
in a few days. Nobody has.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.461
-That's so weird.
-It's so weird.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.422
-He calls his mom every day?
-Yeah, they're very close.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.007
Yeah, he's her favorite.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.301
Someone's got to be the black sheep.
Baa baa!

02:16.010 --> 02:18.304
So, Judy, uh... [sighs]

02:18.596 --> 02:20.098
I don't wanna freak you out,

02:20.181 --> 02:23.643
but the FBI came by the house today
looking for Steve.

02:24.018 --> 02:24.936
Have you seen him?

02:25.353 --> 02:27.272
[both] Uh...

02:27.647 --> 02:28.731
What did you do?

02:29.524 --> 02:31.025
What do we do?

02:33.403 --> 02:34.237
No.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.947
-Nope.
-Haven't seen him.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.450
I'm sorry, the-- the FBI

02:40.285 --> 02:41.369
is looking for Steve?

02:42.203 --> 02:43.997
Like, the American...

02:45.748 --> 02:46.791
FBI?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.293
Yeah, that FBI.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.670
-Why?
-I have no idea.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.381
I mean, honestly, he's been
in trouble before, but not like this.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.301
You know, this isn't him getting
into a fist fight at a Sugar Ray concert.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.720
Well, to be fair,
the guy was there ironically.

02:58.803 --> 02:59.929
That's just so douchey.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.764
-What?
-Sugar Ray's so fucking douchey.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.808
-They have a couple good songs.
-They don't. Name one.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.101
He's a journalist now.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.353
[Henry] Mom.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.688
[Jen] Honey. Hi, babe.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.523
Can you just get your bowl,
get your cereal,

03:10.607 --> 03:12.942
let's, you know what I mean,
start the process of the morning?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.653
Okay. Uh, hi.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.363
-Hey, bud.
-Well, this is my friend Ben.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.032
I didn't know you had other friends.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.117
-Oh.
-[Jen] Sweetheart.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.286
I'm worried.
Dad didn't come to my window this morning.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.914
He didn't? I'm sure it's fine.
I'm sure he's just busy being a bird.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.082
[gasps] What the frig?

03:28.166 --> 03:29.000
-[Judy] What?
-Okay.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.878
My dad just texted
saying they raided Steve's office.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.004
[Judy] What?

03:33.546 --> 03:34.505
I got to go.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.467
Um, he's wigging out. I have to go.

03:38.051 --> 03:38.885
Thank you.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.178
Bye.

03:41.179 --> 03:44.515
Wait, the FBI is looking for Steve?
The fucking FBI.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.725
Why?

03:45.892 --> 03:48.978
-I think that might be on me, actually.
-Huh? What are you talking about?

03:49.729 --> 03:52.774
I turned Steve in for money laundering
last week.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.109
You what? You did what?

03:55.193 --> 03:57.070
-I know. It's a lot to process.
-Oh, my God.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.780
How can you be just telling me this now?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.866
Oh, and he has a fucking identical twin?

04:02.408 --> 04:04.911
You didn't feel like you should have
mentioned that before?

04:04.994 --> 04:06.579
-Well, they're semi-identical.
-Oh, stop!

04:06.663 --> 04:08.456
They're the fucking same person!

04:08.539 --> 04:10.667
Okay. There was a lot going on, all right?

04:10.750 --> 04:12.627
You and I weren't exactly talking
when I turned Steve in.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.922
[whispers] Then you did what you had
to do. I had to help you hide the body.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.840
-What are you doing? I liked that one.
-Shut up!

04:17.924 --> 04:18.758
Okay.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.635
Do you even know how fucked I am?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.137
I mean, if it wasn't bad before, it's...

04:23.221 --> 04:24.430
The FBI?

04:25.139 --> 04:27.225
I mean, they're good
at connecting dots, Judy,

04:27.308 --> 04:30.520
-and we are the fucking dots.
-No, we are not the dots.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.313
Steve's business is the dots.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.606
That's all the FBI cares about.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.984
They're actually really nice.
I've been cooperating with them.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.485
What? You-- I'm sorry...

04:38.278 --> 04:40.863
Oh, my God.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.575
[exhales] Steve was right.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.496
Wherever you go, fucking chaos follows.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.623
I'm sorry.

04:51.207 --> 04:54.294
I'm so sorry. Please.
I didn't mean to drag you into this mess.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.587
-I'm sorry.
-Can you please just stop saying sorry?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.799
You say sorry so much,
it doesn't mean anything anymore.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.593
It's just like this fucking sound
that comes out of your mouth.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.678
Okay, sorry. [exhales]

05:04.679 --> 05:06.347
What's gonna happen to my boys, Judy?

05:07.932 --> 05:10.226
If I get caught... [sighs]

05:10.310 --> 05:11.519
...what's gonna happen to them?

05:12.186 --> 05:13.521
They're gonna be orphans.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.148
-No.
-Yes.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.317
They'll be all alone, Judy.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.320
No, I won't let that happen.
I will be there for them.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.489
[laughs] You? Oh, God.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.575
You think I'm gonna leave my kids to you?

05:25.658 --> 05:28.286
You were just sleeping
in a car ten hours ago.

05:28.369 --> 05:31.331
You might have the worst judgment
of anyone that I have ever met.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.834
I can help us out of this.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.004
I can go to the FBI
and steer 'em in a different direction.

05:38.087 --> 05:38.921
No.

05:39.797 --> 05:43.009
You do not talk to the FBI.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.261
You don't steer anything.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.472
Just stay the fuck out of it.

05:50.016 --> 05:50.850
[Ben] <i>Mexico?</i>

05:50.933 --> 05:53.561
Yeah. I was thinking about it,
and I remembered

05:53.936 --> 05:56.314
that Steve always said that
if he ever got in real trouble,

05:56.397 --> 05:57.857
that he would just go down to Mexico,

05:57.940 --> 06:00.651
get a new identity and, like,
go away forever.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.445
-A new identity?
-Yeah, right?

06:02.528 --> 06:05.823
There's somewhere your family used
to vacation. He always talked about it.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.617
I mean, we used to go to Rosarito.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.576
Rosarito!

06:09.911 --> 06:11.162
Hey, girl.

06:11.245 --> 06:12.121
-Hey, Ben.
-Hey.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.956
-Hey, girl.
-No word from Steve, huh?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.875
No. Weird, right, girl?

06:15.958 --> 06:16.834
Super weird.

06:16.918 --> 06:20.505
What is going on?
Because the FBI guys were really rude.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.590
They took all of the computers
and didn't even want water.

06:22.673 --> 06:23.716
Girl, that is rude.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.218
-Right, girl?
-Girl.

06:27.053 --> 06:27.970
[Ben sighs]

06:30.598 --> 06:31.641
Oh, my God.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.269
Steve, what did you do?

06:54.956 --> 06:55.832
[chattering, laughing]

06:55.915 --> 06:59.252
[Lorna] I don't care
if the condo is carpeted, Janice.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.837
Just sell it.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.842
Look who made the cover
of <i>Over Asking, </i>Jennifer.

07:05.925 --> 07:06.843
Wow, look at you.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.929
Do you know how long I've worked
for this moment?

07:13.057 --> 07:14.684
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were gonna
go through--

07:14.767 --> 07:16.185
-Thirty-six years.
-Thirty-six years.

07:16.811 --> 07:20.523
Um, well, that's quite the feather
in your cap.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.525
Am I picking up on a little jealousy?

07:22.984 --> 07:25.653
That's not what I'm putting down.
Oh, I was drinking that.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.239
Well, congratulations.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.657
It is well-deserved.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.742
As my Aunt Trista used to say,

07:31.826 --> 07:34.245
"Success and passion are two sides
of the same coin.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.164
Use the coin, and dreams fly.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.874
Lose the coin, and..."

07:39.667 --> 07:42.545
Oh, can't remember.
But it's all in the article.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.674
Oh, great. I really can't wait to dig in.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.803
Lorna, I need to ask you something.
It's...

07:51.262 --> 07:53.764
-It's, uh, it's about the boys.
-Oh.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.933
-I'm all ears.
-Okay.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.352
Okay, um...

07:59.604 --> 08:02.315
In the event that something may happen
to me,

08:03.024 --> 08:05.526
I was wondering if, um...

08:06.486 --> 08:10.031
if you would be the boys' legal guardian.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.451
How long do you have?

08:13.534 --> 08:15.453
What? No, I'm not sick.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.246
You don't have to be brave with me,
you're family.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.164
No, really.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.124
No, I'm just... [sighs]

08:20.416 --> 08:21.959
I'm redoing my will. 

08:22.627 --> 08:24.629
Just thought, since Ted, that I...

08:24.712 --> 08:26.255
I should update some stuff.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.800
Of course. That's wise.

08:29.884 --> 08:30.718
Yeah.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.974
Raising Ted was the great honor
of my life.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.562
It would be my privilege
to raise those boys.

08:41.646 --> 08:42.605
Okay.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.775
-Still, I'd get some blood work done.
-Hmm?

08:45.858 --> 08:46.901
You're looking a little brittle.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.695
-Thank you.
-[Lorna] How's your sleep?

08:50.863 --> 08:52.657
Well, it could be better.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.408
Hmm. Well.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.372
It says to take one, but you can take two.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.123
-You'll sleep like a baby.
-Okay.

09:02.124 --> 09:04.835
-This is fentanyl, Lorna.
-Huh?

09:04.919 --> 09:06.504
How did you even get this?

09:07.672 --> 09:10.049
I truly can't remember.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.761
Well, must be good shit, then.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.639
Friggin' Steve.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.599
Didn't make enough money as a lawyer,

09:18.683 --> 09:21.227
he had to steal,
or whatever the heck money laundering is.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.895
Yeah, I'm not really sure.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.692
I mean, I do know that it has something
to do with his art gallery.

09:28.484 --> 09:29.318
What?

09:30.111 --> 09:32.321
He told us he opened that
to sell your paintings.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.574
Yeah, that's what he told me, too, but...

09:35.491 --> 09:36.909
it's really just a front.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.370
I'll probably never see
those paintings again.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.081
Can I just say that...

09:43.040 --> 09:45.751

I mean, it would've been great
to have you in the family,

09:50.423 --> 09:51.924
but he doesn't deserve you.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.552
You're much better off without him.

I don't know. I mean, at the time,
it seemed like a really good idea,

It's from a trip that Steve and I took
to the Petrified Forest.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.606
[clicks tongue]
Man, I thought you were my tacos.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.191
Yeah, sorry to disappoint.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.736
I wanted to tell you that you were right.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.029
[Nick] About what?

21:21.697 --> 21:25.492
Judy Hale and Steve Wood were responsible
for the Harding hit-and-run,

21:25.575 --> 21:30.956
but there is so much more going on there,
and I could really use some help, if...

21:31.540 --> 21:32.874
-you're interested.
-Wait.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.586
Are you offering me a job right now?

21:37.045 --> 21:38.880
-[sighs]
-If you pass a psych test

21:38.964 --> 21:43.468
-and a breathalyzer.
-[laughs]

21:43.593 --> 21:46.596
Why would I want to work with you

21:47.222 --> 21:49.057
or Hastings, for that matter?

21:49.141 --> 21:51.476
That shady racist,
is he still chief of police?

21:51.852 --> 21:54.438
He's also a misogynist, but yeah.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.023
[Nick] Then, no.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.068
But, uh...

22:01.653 --> 22:03.655
[Nick sniffles, yawns]

22:05.615 --> 22:06.533
Wow.

22:10.912 --> 22:11.955
[sighs]

22:14.249 --> 22:15.375
I did some digging.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.961
Might be something useful in here.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.049
Okay, well, if you change your mind--

22:22.132 --> 22:23.508
Sorry to stop by again.

22:23.592 --> 22:27.763
I was in the neighborhood because
I purposefully came to this neighborhood

22:28.138 --> 22:29.181
to just do this.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.390
[chuckles] Anyhoo.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.308
Anyway.

22:31.391 --> 22:34.686
Uh, found this at my parents.
I believe this is a Judy Hale original.

22:34.770 --> 22:35.812
[Judy] Oh, my God.

22:35.896 --> 22:39.232
I painted this for your mom, like,
five years ago for Christmas.

22:40.692 --> 22:41.735
You sure I can have it back?

22:41.818 --> 22:44.112
-It wasn't prominently displayed.
-Oh.

22:44.821 --> 22:47.449
-Well, thank you. That's so sweet.
-No, that's very sweet of you.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.409
-We should probably--
-You wanna come in?

22:50.952 --> 22:52.871
I mean, sure.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.206
Great.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.588
Judy, this pie is amazing.

23:01.671 --> 23:02.506
Thanks.

23:04.466 --> 23:07.969
Uh, can I get you some beer or some wine
or something?

23:08.053 --> 23:09.388
Thank you. I don't drink.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.098
[Judy] How about tea?

23:11.723 --> 23:14.184
Oh, I will get crunk on some chamomile.

23:14.559 --> 23:15.394
Okay.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.647
Hey, Mom, can I go outside
and look for Dad Bird?

23:19.064 --> 23:19.940
It's probably dead.

23:20.023 --> 23:23.276
Hey! Char.
Don't listen to him. Yes, you may.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.195
I'm just being real with him.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.030
Somebody should be.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.031
Come on, bro...

23:31.118 --> 23:32.536
I'm sorry about that. He's...

23:33.120 --> 23:36.123
He's just been going through a lot
since his dad died.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.124
Oh.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.835
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.546
I have a teenager too. [laughs]

23:42.629 --> 23:45.924
And I know it's not the same thing,
but when his mom and I got a divorce,

23:46.049 --> 23:49.428
he, um... vandalized a Carl's Jr.

23:50.303 --> 23:52.764
-That I can get behind. [scoffs]
-[laughs]

23:53.598 --> 23:56.309
Hey, um, thank you for inviting me in.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.311
It's nice to be somewhere outside
of my parents' house.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.522
They're just pacing and stressing
and worrying.

24:00.605 --> 24:01.606
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.859
And Judy's totally right.
Steve is down in Mexico.

24:05.694 --> 24:06.987
Oh. She told you that?

24:07.112 --> 24:08.989
Yeah, we went to his office together.

24:10.031 --> 24:10.907
Got it.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.285
Yeah. This whole thing was just...

24:14.286 --> 24:15.287
It's peak Steve.

24:15.745 --> 24:19.624
You know, I used to always say,
wherever Steve goes, chaos follows.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.836
-Here's your tea.
-[Ben] Mmm!

24:22.919 --> 24:24.212
You like extra honey, right?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.840
-Oh, honey me, honey.
-[Judy] I remembered.

24:27.924 --> 24:31.428
-[exhales] I'm already feeling it.
-[both laughing]

24:31.511 --> 24:32.762
[Henry]  Mom, I found Dad,

24:32.846 --> 24:34.598
-and he's not okay. Come on!
-[Ben] What?

24:38.977 --> 24:40.312
-Come on.
-[bird chirping]

24:40.437 --> 24:42.981
-Mom, you gotta do something.
-Oh, God, okay. Um...

24:43.690 --> 24:45.901
-I don't know.
-What if I can climb up on the freezer?

24:45.984 --> 24:47.444
-Oh, no, you don't have to...
-Yeah? No?

24:47.527 --> 24:49.112
-I think it's just too low for you.
-Oh.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.697
-What about a ladder?
-Ladder, yes.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.199
-Um, over here.
-[Ben] Great.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.034
Hang on, little fella.

24:54.117 --> 24:55.827
[bird chirps]

24:56.453 --> 24:58.288
-[Jen] Oh, great.
-[Ben] All right.

24:59.456 --> 25:00.582
Judy's got it.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.878
Come here. Come here, little birdie.

25:04.961 --> 25:08.215
-Come on. Ow, ooh, I got you.
-[chirps]

25:08.298 --> 25:10.509
[gasps] I got you.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.220
-Hi, friend.
-[chirps]

25:16.765 --> 25:17.599
Hi.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.356
Wow, what a beautiful backyard.

25:25.023 --> 25:25.941
Thank you.

25:28.026 --> 25:28.860
Oh, God.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.488
You must live in that pool.

25:32.572 --> 25:33.657
Not really.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.202
-I'd die to get in that pool.
-[groans]

25:38.453 --> 25:39.287
You ready?

25:40.372 --> 25:41.998
But what if he never comes back?

25:44.167 --> 25:46.127
I like to think if you love someone,

25:47.003 --> 25:48.463
they're always with you,

25:48.922 --> 25:50.215
no matter where they go.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.260
Okay. I'm ready.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.059
[Judy gasps]

26:01.560 --> 26:03.603
-[Henry chuckles]
-[Judy] Look. He didn't wanna go.

26:05.605 --> 26:07.315
[Ben] Well, look at that, he stayed.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.818
[Ben laughs] Yeah.

26:09.901 --> 26:10.860
Oh, how about that?

26:12.696 --> 26:14.698
Looks like he's not ready to leave
just yet, is he?

26:14.781 --> 26:15.615
[Henry] Yeah, not yet.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.075
Thank you for handling that.

26:17.158 --> 26:19.911
-[Ben] How long have you had him?
-[Henry] Well, um, he's my dad.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.454
It's a good thing you were here.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.290
[Ben] And he'll continue to be.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.791
I'm glad it's a good thing.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.587
Judy, I--

26:31.006 --> 26:32.048
I'm sorry.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.552
It's okay.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.331
[tapping]

27:09.878 --> 27:10.754

27:47.248 --> 27:50.293
Oh. You're not a dad bird, are you?

27:51.461 --> 27:54.422
You're a mom. [sighs]
