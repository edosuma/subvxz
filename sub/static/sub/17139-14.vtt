WEBVTT

00:03.200 --> 00:06.409
Vampires.
It's funnier every time I hear it.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.604
DEAN:
<i>Vampires nest in groups of eight to ten.</i>

00:09.760 --> 00:12.001
<i>Victims are taken to the nest,
where the packs keep them alive,</i>

00:12.160 --> 00:14.447
<i>bleeding them for days or weeks.</i>

00:17.440 --> 00:22.048
We don't decapitate vampires.
We irradiate them.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.327
Cool.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.729
The toys are the fun part.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.081
SAM: <i>For obvious reasons,
we don't trust the Brits.</i>

00:34.120 --> 00:36.885
DEAN: <i>Well, what the hell?
Aren't we supposed to be on the same team?</i>

00:37.520 --> 00:39.921
MR. KETCH: <i>I know all about the Colt.</i>

00:40.800 --> 00:43.804
MARY: <i>You know, there's only five things
in all creation it can't kill.</i>

00:44.200 --> 00:45.884
You think Mom
would have wanted this for us?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.247
Nothing comes before my family.
Not with me.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.481
Really?

00:50.680 --> 00:53.001
Or is that just what you want to believe?

00:53.640 --> 00:55.927
You're an excellent liar, Mary.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.287
Too bad Mom couldn't make it.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.330
Yeah. I feel like something's going on
with her, and she ain't talking about it.

01:00.680 --> 01:04.001
I have sort of been working
with the British Men of Letters.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.487
So, where does that leave us?

01:14.920 --> 01:18.925
Just hear me out.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.640
Please.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.202
- Wow. Just, wow.
- Mmm.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.126
Dean...

01:27.280 --> 01:31.171
What the British Men of Letters are doing,
what we're doing,

01:31.480 --> 01:33.642
it's a better way. They...

01:35.560 --> 01:40.043
Look, I'm not blind to who they are,
or what they've done, but...

01:40.280 --> 01:41.361
When?

01:44.680 --> 01:47.524
When? When did you
start working with them?

01:49.520 --> 01:53.127
Since before the lake house.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.644
It wasn't Wally.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.050
They brought me that case.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.680
You were running an errand for the Brits?

02:05.160 --> 02:06.685
You kept it from us?

02:08.880 --> 02:10.245
Cass almost died.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.690
- I...
- A hunter got killed.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.086
You think I don't know?

02:14.440 --> 02:18.923
I'm the one who burned his body.
I'm the one who told his wife.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.724
I watch him die every night.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.206
Good.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.324
Nice work today.

03:21.920 --> 03:26.050
I must say, this little beauty
certainly worked as advertised.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.248
We barely had to lift a finger.

03:30.600 --> 03:34.321
Ah, the AVD. I do love a new toy.

03:52.240 --> 03:55.687
Mary? Everything all right?

03:57.280 --> 03:58.327
I'm fine.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.161
- Ketch.
- Serena.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.249
You're headed past the armory,
if you wouldn't mind.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.962
Unpack, re-shelve, and my Sig Sauer
could use a good scrubbing.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.603
I have three PhDs.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.369
And we're all very proud of you, love.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.364
MARY: <i>I'm doing this for you.</i>

04:39.520 --> 04:41.204
I'm playing three decades of
catch-up here.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.925
And we're not?

04:44.520 --> 04:46.488
How do you think this has been for us?

04:46.720 --> 04:49.724
We're your sons. And you've been gone.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.204
Our whole lives, you've been gone.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.040
You said that you need time.
No, you said you need space.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.483
So we gave you your space.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.682
But you didn't need just space.
No, you needed space from us.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.570
That's not true.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.121
<i>Dean, I'm trying...</i>

05:10.320 --> 05:13.244
How about for once,
you just try and be a mom.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.607
MARY: <i>I am your mother,</i>

05:15.760 --> 05:18.445
but I am not just a mom.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.762
And you are not a child.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.005
I never was.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.689
<i>- So, between us and them...
- It's not like that.</i>

05:27.920 --> 05:29.524
Yeah, Mary, it is.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.762
And you made your choice.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.049
So there's the door.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.126
Sam...

05:55.600 --> 05:56.965
You should go.

06:26.960 --> 06:32.046
Another nest terminated, no complications.
Bit boring, really.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.801
Good. Well, boring's good.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.006
And how's Mary?

06:40.160 --> 06:41.924
Excellent. As always.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.650
She say anything about her boys?

06:45.640 --> 06:49.440
As I've said many, many, so many times,
we don't need them.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.881
We already have the best Winchester.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.050
Yes. But that's not your call, is it?

06:56.280 --> 06:57.520
Or mine.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.763
The old men want them on board.

07:05.440 --> 07:09.365
As far as London's concerned,
where Sam and Dean Winchester go,

07:09.840 --> 07:11.763
the rest of
the American hunters will follow.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.361
Hmm.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.205
Dead guy in Akron.
Body found two days ago.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.528
Throat ripped out, ear to ear.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.730
- Well, good morning to you, too.
- Read it.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.243
The guy was a known drug dealer,
with enemies.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.284
And his throat wasn't ripped out,
it was slit. With a knife.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.682
I'm not really sure
this is our kind of thing.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.571
We don't know that.
His blood could've been drained.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.205
It could've been?

08:00.520 --> 08:01.726
You know what?

08:01.960 --> 08:06.045
You find us a case,
'cause I need to hit something. Now.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.680
- You wanna talk about it?
- Not really.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.165
What was she thinking, man?

08:21.800 --> 08:23.131
I don't know.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.441
- Maybe we should ask her.
- What?

08:27.800 --> 08:28.926
Look,

08:29.240 --> 08:33.847
I am pissed and frustrated
and confused, too.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.283
- But we've frozen her out for days.
- She lied to us, Sam.

08:37.520 --> 08:38.520
- I know.
- For months.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.563
I know. But it's Mom!

08:41.080 --> 08:43.970
I mean, whatever she was doing,
she must've had a good reason.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.282
A good reason? A good reason
for working with those ass-clowns?

08:46.640 --> 08:48.608
Look, I hear you, all right?

08:48.840 --> 08:52.003
But at the end of the day, she's family.
We owe it to her to at least...

08:52.240 --> 08:54.163
All right. You know what? Screw it.
I need a drink.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.441
You...

08:55.680 --> 08:58.445
No, I need drinks. Plural.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.923
And this whole peacemaker shtick
that you've been running.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.967
First with Cass, now with Mom?
It's getting old, man.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.647
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You're always playing the middle, Sam.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.121
For once, why don't you pick a side?

09:56.960 --> 09:58.564
Thanks for coming.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.001
What's so urgent?

10:03.360 --> 10:05.601
Sam. I messed up.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.444
I know I messed up,

10:10.120 --> 10:12.726
but what
the British Men of Letters are doing...

10:13.440 --> 10:17.240
This is bigger than us, Sam.
We've got a real shot here.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.367
A shot at what?

10:20.560 --> 10:22.289
A world without monsters.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.088
A world where you and Dean
don't have to hunt,

10:25.240 --> 10:27.322
where you can have normal lives.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.402
- I chose this life.
- I know.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.849
But you were going to school, to college.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.408
And I get why you gave it up.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.403
But what if you didn't have to?

10:43.600 --> 10:46.922
What if there was
a different future for you, for us?

10:48.320 --> 10:51.324
That's why I'm doing this.
That is what I am fighting for.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.286
I am not trying to recruit you,
but you need to know.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.244
Things are changing.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.011
Please. Just let me show you.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.964
It's just in here.

11:31.800 --> 11:32.961
<i>Wow.</i>

11:33.120 --> 11:35.646
Believe it or not,
this is just their temporary base.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.963
The Brits talk like they're roughing it.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.850
Sam Winchester.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.323
You didn't tell me
your son was stopping by.

11:44.760 --> 11:45.807
Didn't know I had to.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.844
Anyway, welcome.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.441
Yeah.

11:53.600 --> 11:57.002
Um, you know, I really dig the whole
low-budget <i>Mission: Impossible</i> vibe,

11:57.160 --> 11:58.525
but I'm gonna head back.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.290
You sure?
You're just in time for the briefing.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.321
Mick.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.285
<i>I mean, that is, if you want to hear</i>

12:07.440 --> 12:10.603
how we're going to exterminate
every last vampire in America.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.241
Sammy?

12:23.520 --> 12:25.522
Lucy, I...

12:31.240 --> 12:32.571
Whatever.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.040
Oh, no.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.201
Where's Ketch?

12:52.400 --> 12:55.768
I don't know. He wasn't in his room,
and he isn't answering his mobile.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.682
- Should we wait?
- No.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.889
Did you forget your key?

13:09.480 --> 13:10.561
Hello, mate.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.846
How'd you find us?

13:15.240 --> 13:19.723
This is a Men of Letters bunker.
The location's no secret to us.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.887
Okay. Cool. Well, good talk.

13:27.680 --> 13:32.720
And whilst I understand that you're
not feeling warmly disposed to me,

13:33.560 --> 13:38.088
I wonder, what's your disposition
to this incredibly rare,

13:38.240 --> 13:43.770
unspeakably expensive bottle
of barrel proof Scotch?

13:49.040 --> 13:50.963
Before we get started,
we've got a few new faces.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.568
This is Pierce Moncrieff,
a hunter out of Baton Rouge.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.843
Pierce, meet Alton Morehead,
our head of R and D,

13:58.040 --> 14:00.441
weapons development, spellwork,
that sort of thing.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.201
And Serena Colman,
our Head of Security and Surveillance.

14:05.360 --> 14:09.001
And, of course, you know Mary Winchester,
and her son.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.561
Sam, please. Plenty of seats.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.480
I'm fine.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.169
All right, then. Let's begin.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.007
As most of you know,
Phase One of Project V is nearly complete.

14:23.400 --> 14:27.291
<i>Over the past months,
we've focused our efforts on the MWR.</i>

14:27.960 --> 14:29.849
- Midwest region.
<i>- When we started our operation,</i>

14:30.080 --> 14:33.084
<i>there were 241 vampires
active across 12 states.</i>

14:33.480 --> 14:37.201
We've killed all but 11.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.611
Wait, what? Seriously?

14:41.680 --> 14:42.761
How?

14:44.360 --> 14:48.331
You American hunters
tend to see vampires as criminals, rogues.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.883
<i>One gets out of line, you show up,
lop off its head, and leave town.</i>

14:52.400 --> 14:54.129
<i>We treat them more like terrorists.</i>

14:54.320 --> 14:57.927
Vampires may typically hunt alone,

14:58.280 --> 15:03.002
<i>or in small nests, but scratch
the surface, and they're all connected.</i>

15:03.240 --> 15:07.928
From the lowest drone,
all the way up the chain, to the top.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.161
To the Alpha.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.401
Mmm-hmm.

15:13.600 --> 15:19.846
When we find a nest, we don't just
charge in, <i>à la</i> John Wayne, guns blazing.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.685
We wait. We watch.

15:21.960 --> 15:26.010
We determine the size of the nest.
Its relationships to other vampire groups.

15:26.240 --> 15:31.326
They tend to trade amongst themselves.
Information, victims.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.530
We're constantly expanding
and refining our intelligence,

15:34.720 --> 15:38.361
and when we've learned all we can,
we go, we assemble a team...

15:38.600 --> 15:39.840
And wipe them out.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.650
Now, all the remaining MWR vampires
have bunkered up

15:45.840 --> 15:47.649
<i>in an abandoned apartment building
near Wichita.</i>

15:48.000 --> 15:51.721
<i>The Morest Hotel. They think they're safe.</i>

15:52.000 --> 15:53.650
MARY: <i>We've got the AVD locked and loaded.</i>

15:53.840 --> 15:56.764
ALTON: <i>AVD. Anti-vamp device.</i>

15:56.960 --> 15:58.564
<i>Tomorrow, we ship out.</i>

15:59.040 --> 16:03.568
Raid the compound, terminate the colony
and complete Phase One.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.728
And then we move on
to the rest of the country.

16:06.560 --> 16:10.849
By the time we're done, there won't be
a single bloodsucker left in America.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.091
They're dead.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.804
They're all dead.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.611
My whole nest.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.131
I know, dear.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.365
They got them.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.246
Drink. Get your strength back.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.165
It's human and fresh.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.446
Mmm.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.091
You're safe.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.451
You and all the others.

16:53.600 --> 16:57.127
See, I didn't choose this place
for its ambience.

16:58.440 --> 16:59.680
Obviously.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.563
This? It's a fortress.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.128
No one gets in here
without me knowing about it.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.119
No one.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.491
ALPHA VAMPIRE: <i>Is that so?</i>

17:16.319 --> 17:18.128
Hello, my children.

17:31.560 --> 17:32.641
Hmm.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.162
Nice place. Quaint. Cozy.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.483
Not much for small talk, are we?

17:55.280 --> 17:56.327
Nope.

17:56.520 --> 17:59.490
Well, surely you have some questions.
Why I'm here, for instance.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.484
You're here to recruit us.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.369
You already got Mary playing your game.
You want me. And Sam.

18:08.560 --> 18:11.848
Well, I don't, but the old lads
have taken quite a shine to you.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.001
Hmm.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.886
Well, maybe they shouldn't have
sent some chick to try and kill us.

18:16.080 --> 18:20.210
Yes. Toni. No one predicted
she would go rogue. No one but me.

18:22.480 --> 18:28.044
I had a sneak peek at what a neurotic,
overreaching time bomb she was.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.610
We used to date.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.926
Yeah, I can see that.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.644
Dean, I don't give a toss if you sign up.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.690
Honestly, I don't care if you live or die.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.564
But, since we're such
jolly good pals now...

18:47.760 --> 18:49.171
Jolly good, huh?

18:51.720 --> 18:56.408
Let me just say that
the Men of Letters is an excellent fit for

18:57.040 --> 19:00.522
someone with our inclinations.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.401
Our? As in, you and me?

19:04.240 --> 19:07.926
You're a killer, Dean Winchester.
And so am I.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.403
And if we go too long without something
to track, or trap, or punch or gut?

19:13.600 --> 19:17.207
Well, things get a bit ugly, don't they?

19:22.080 --> 19:24.208
The Men of Letters keep me busy.

19:24.400 --> 19:28.610
They point me in a direction, and bang,
off to the races.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.889
It's not a bad life.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.730
Speaking of...

19:37.320 --> 19:38.401
Mmm.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.806
Oh...

19:45.400 --> 19:47.721
Now that you've heard
what I have to say...

19:48.440 --> 19:51.091
Places to be, vampires to behead.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.490
You got a line on vamps?

19:55.560 --> 19:56.686
I do.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.487
Interested?

20:05.480 --> 20:07.130
Damn. Sam Winchester.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.089
Rufus told me all about you.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.601
See, him and me, we worked a case
together down the Atchafalaya.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.847
I heard.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.330
Gotta tell ya, I sure do miss
that crotchety old son of a bitch.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.366
Pierce? Mary? A question.

20:25.760 --> 20:29.082
So, thoughts on our little operation?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.401
Mmm? And our team?

20:37.600 --> 20:40.922
Serena and Alton seem smart. Pierce...

20:42.600 --> 20:45.001
You know he calls himself
"The Hunter King of Baton Rouge"?

20:45.200 --> 20:46.929
I do. Unfortunately.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.409
A buddy of mine knew him.
They worked together. Once.

20:53.960 --> 20:57.203
Right, you see, truth is,
your mother excepted,

20:57.400 --> 21:01.166
we've struggled to attract the top shelf
of American hunters.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.161
Like you.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.770
So, what do we got?

21:31.240 --> 21:33.811
Ten bloodsuckers. Give or take.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.369
Two against 10. I like those odds.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.200
Yeah. Sun will be down in an hour.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.723
<i>So, we should move fast.</i>

21:42.680 --> 21:45.126
Keep the rats from fleeing the ship.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.046
Fancy.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.608
You're right. Little too easy.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.409
Got another of those?

22:03.880 --> 22:05.086
You ready?

22:05.480 --> 22:06.527
Always.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.970
The place seems empty.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.764
Yes. Curious.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.286
Sam, this is why I asked you to come.

22:38.600 --> 22:42.400
Even if you want no part of it,
you needed to know.

22:42.720 --> 22:46.327
So it wasn't a sales pitch?
'Cause it was a good one.

23:13.120 --> 23:16.363
I checked the areas upstairs. This place
is a ghost town. You got anything?

23:16.520 --> 23:18.249
Indeed.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.051
I found her hiding in the basement,
with the corpses.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.321
Let me go!

23:31.680 --> 23:33.364
Where are your friends?

23:34.160 --> 23:35.685
I don't know.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.330
- No.
- Where are they?

23:51.400 --> 23:52.526
Tell.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.281
Me.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.201
Where.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.850
Okay. All right. That's enough.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.447
Enough? She's a monster.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.087
I know.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.965
Just... Let me.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.840
You're gonna need to tell us
where your friends are.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.161
And you'll let me go?

24:19.360 --> 24:20.566
I'll make it quick.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.211
Hunting. They went hunting.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.851
Hunting who?

24:32.640 --> 24:33.880
The hunters.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.571
SERENA: Where's McGillacutty?

24:53.560 --> 24:55.164
What's happening?

25:03.720 --> 25:06.724
It's the Morest vampires. They're here.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.401
Go, go.

25:22.720 --> 25:23.721
No.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.729
All right,
we gotta lock this place down ASAP.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.527
- Fall back!
- Lock this place down now!

25:29.760 --> 25:34.800
<i>Fall back! Secure all exits.
Do not engage. Fall back now.</i>

26:21.600 --> 26:22.601
Nice.

26:44.360 --> 26:46.408
Wait! Wait.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.042
- Doors locked?
- For now.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.603
The rest, they're spreading out.
Surrounding the building.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.211
How did they find us?

27:03.720 --> 27:06.121
How'd they even know who we are?

27:08.200 --> 27:11.727
He told us. He's back to save us all.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.201
Our father.

27:15.520 --> 27:19.047
Your father? The Alpha?

27:19.320 --> 27:22.369
No. That's impossible.
Our intel has him in Morocco.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.010
He's been there for at least a decade.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.406
Wrong.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.686
I met him five years ago
in Hoople, North Dakota.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.971
You're dead. You're all dead.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.767
Your extermination plans.
Do they have any contingencies for this?

27:57.040 --> 27:58.041
No.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.449
Comm's still out.
What about a scrying spell?

28:02.600 --> 28:05.251
- If we can get a message to England...
- No. We can't wait for backup.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.761
No, he's right.
This place was not built for defense.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.763
And those doors will not hold long.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.441
Okay.

28:13.120 --> 28:16.522
Who here has ever killed anything?

28:24.400 --> 28:25.731
Great.

28:30.640 --> 28:34.247
All right. We gotta arm up.
Everybody, weapons on the table.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.563
Blades, guns, spells.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.802
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.041
It's not enough.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.925
Most of our weapons are in the armory,
including the AVD.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.844
We could set it off in the vents.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.646
Maximize coverage,
use the gas like a bug bomb.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.041
Will it kill the Alpha?

29:02.640 --> 29:07.009
- Kill him? I doubt it. Hurt, maybe.
- You got anything stronger?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.081
Where is it?

29:46.600 --> 29:48.443
Where did you get this?

29:50.480 --> 29:51.891
I stole it.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.126
From Ramiel.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.964
Yeah, but it doesn't work.
We have no bullets.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.126
Right.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.651
You're right.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.883
Right. Okay, we make some then.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.289
I got the recipe from my buddy.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.729
- Bobby Singer?
- Yep.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.207
All right, Mick, you're gonna need
holy oil, sage and myrrh.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.243
- Do you have that here?
- Yeah.

30:28.480 --> 30:31.370
Okay, make a tincture,
coat a silver bullet.

30:32.040 --> 30:35.283
Use this spell.
It'll mimic the original etchings.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.041
And that'll work?

30:39.240 --> 30:42.767
It better. If not, start praying.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.610
'Cause we'll need a miracle.
Where's the armory?

30:46.920 --> 30:49.287
- I'll take you.
- I got your back.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.127
Get to work. Keep that door locked.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.961
This way. The armory's out there.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.570
Is there another way?
Is there another way?

31:16.720 --> 31:17.767
It's back there.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.200
Go! I've got them!

31:19.920 --> 31:21.001
Come on! Come on! Come on!

31:33.680 --> 31:36.331
All right. Let's get the spell going.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.321
Got it.

31:58.640 --> 31:59.641
It's me! Open the damn door!

32:02.520 --> 32:03.601
What happened?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.161
It was bad out there.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.651
Pretty bad in here too, huh?

32:18.760 --> 32:20.046
No.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.723
Pierce. You're a hunter.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.410
Yes. My hunter.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.768
Pierce and I have an arrangement.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.402
He keeps me off the radar

33:04.720 --> 33:08.406
and I pay him very, very well.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.210
Alimony's a bitch.

33:11.440 --> 33:14.762
I'm old. I like living quietly.

33:16.080 --> 33:19.607
You've been making my life
awfully noisy lately.

33:20.920 --> 33:24.003
You've killed so many of my children.

33:25.320 --> 33:28.449
I've seen your work, in England.

33:29.760 --> 33:33.128
I didn't get involved because, well,

33:33.880 --> 33:35.370
it's England.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.771
But America, yes.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.121
America is my home.

33:46.680 --> 33:48.762
And it is time

33:49.120 --> 33:54.001
you get off my lawn.

33:56.680 --> 34:00.810
Mom? Mom? Mom, hey. Are you all right?

34:01.040 --> 34:02.121
Sam.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.291
What happened?

34:06.000 --> 34:07.684
Got it.

34:09.639 --> 34:11.290
All clear here, big daddy.

34:13.920 --> 34:14.920
We have to go.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.521
Yeah. Right. All right.
Come on. I got you.

34:17.760 --> 34:18.966
Here's what you're going to do.

34:19.159 --> 34:21.639
We will bring your communications
back online.

34:21.840 --> 34:25.083
You will make a call to your superiors
in London.

34:25.360 --> 34:29.967
You'll admit defeat. You will tell them
to cancel this American incursion.

34:31.040 --> 34:36.170
And then they'll watch as
I devour you live, on screen.

34:37.440 --> 34:41.286
Yes, it's a bit messy, but sometimes
one does have to make a point.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.719
Don't!

34:47.000 --> 34:49.889
My, my-

34:51.520 --> 34:54.330
The Colt. Powerful weapon.

34:54.840 --> 34:58.686
<i>Sam, you are aware that there are
five creatures on this Earth</i>

34:58.880 --> 35:00.370
<i>that gun cannot kill.</i>

35:00.920 --> 35:03.764
- I'm one of them.
- If that were true, I'd be dead already.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.888
That gun can't save all of you.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.129
Who said I was here to save all of us?

35:17.160 --> 35:20.960
My family and I, we kill vamps
when they get out of line.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.891
And you've let us.

35:23.320 --> 35:27.769
I have many children, Sam.
What's one, two, here or there?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.161
Exactly.

35:30.040 --> 35:33.283
So, let my mom and me go.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.165
<i>We'll walk</i> away.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.282
Go back to the way things were.
To the way things are supposed to be.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.888
Hunters and vampires. Cops and robbers.
A fair fight.

35:45.760 --> 35:46.886
And the Brit?

35:49.760 --> 35:50.886
You can have him.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.923
Sam? What are you doing?

35:56.600 --> 35:57.647
Picking a side.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.321
You bastard.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.081
SAM: Mom!

36:13.800 --> 36:18.442
Sam, you and I both know
that gun isn't loaded.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.281
You sure?

36:27.120 --> 36:29.282
<i>That gun can't save all of you.</i>

36:29.520 --> 36:31.204
<i>Who said I was here to save all of us?</i>

36:31.400 --> 36:32.606
Bastard.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.370
No.

36:49.680 --> 36:51.409
Clever, clever boy.

37:29.320 --> 37:30.367
Mick?

37:32.920 --> 37:35.491
Mick. All clear out there.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.365
Took out a few stragglers.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.602
The rest must have run
when we dropped the Alpha.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.086
Come on.

37:53.560 --> 37:54.891
Where were you?

37:55.600 --> 37:57.762
- Following orders.
- That's not...

37:58.320 --> 37:59.367
People died.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.365
Yes, well, I don't know how it is
in your ivory tower,

38:02.520 --> 38:04.648
but down here in the muck, people die.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.046
The old men want the Winchesters,
so I made a play for Dean,

38:08.280 --> 38:11.807
and it was working
until your operation went sideways.

38:14.840 --> 38:17.844
Oh, well, better luck next time.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.209
So, "went out, back later", huh?

38:29.240 --> 38:30.685
Just getting a drink, huh?

38:32.080 --> 38:33.923
I was with him when we heard
this place was under attack.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.366
We drove like a bat out of hell.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.483
How come? I mean,

38:39.120 --> 38:41.566
you don't care for these guys.
You didn't even know I was here.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.890
Right. Of course.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.931
When I thought
something might have happened to you...

38:51.560 --> 38:52.766
Nothing else mattered.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.846
- Dean, the things I said...
- No, Mom, you were...

38:59.920 --> 39:02.764
It's not your job to make my lunch

39:04.000 --> 39:05.604
and kiss me good night. It's...

39:07.560 --> 39:08.846
We're adults.

39:10.200 --> 39:13.044
You're gonna make your own choices,
even if I don't like 'em.

39:13.280 --> 39:16.204
Even if I really, really don't like 'em.

39:18.280 --> 39:21.204
So, that's just something
I'm gonna have to get used to.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.441
Okay. Mom?

39:25.880 --> 39:26.927
Yeah.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.485
Where are you taking him?

39:35.640 --> 39:38.405
We have ways of dealing with
hunters who go rogue.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.210
They aren't pleasant.

39:43.560 --> 39:44.925
- Good.
- Good.

39:55.920 --> 39:56.921
Sam.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.369
If you hadn't been there tonight...

40:02.040 --> 40:04.008
Yeah, we got the kill.
That's what matters.

40:04.640 --> 40:07.166
Hardly an advertisement for
the British Men of Letters, though.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.401
Or my leadership.

40:09.880 --> 40:12.486
Caught unawares,
with our proverbial pants down.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.487
- Believe it or not, Sam, we're not...
- I'm in.

40:19.680 --> 40:22.160
Look, tonight was bad. No doubt.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.361
But the Alpha vampire is dead.

40:27.960 --> 40:31.009
You're changing the world.
And I want to be a part of it.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.361
And your brother?

40:41.200 --> 40:42.486
Give me some time.
