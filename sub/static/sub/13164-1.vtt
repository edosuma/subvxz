00:58.530 --> 01:01.575
- Boone?
- Yes, General?

01:02.325 --> 01:04.953
I'm going into the next office.

01:05.161 --> 01:06.746
Yes, sir.

01:27.725 --> 01:29.310
Damn it!

01:38.361 --> 01:41.113
My name is Bob Wilton.
I'm a journalist.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.824
Part of my job is finding
where the story begins.

01:43.908 --> 01:46.118
If you were looking at my story,
you might think it began

01:46.160 --> 01:49.121
when I got a job at the
Ann Arbor Daily Telegram.

01:49.246 --> 01:50.247
Or you might think it began...

01:50.289 --> 01:53.125
...when I married
my college sweetheart Debora.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.543
But you'd be wrong.

01:54.793 --> 01:57.629
Because the real story of my life
began a few years back,

01:57.671 --> 01:59.673
when my editor sent me
to interview a local guy,

01:59.715 --> 02:01.842
he'd heard on the talk radio show.

02:02.259 --> 02:04.803
The guy claimed to have
some kind of psychic powers.

02:04.845 --> 02:07.973
That he could travel with just his mind
anywhere he wanted.

02:08.056 --> 02:09.890
He called it "Remote Viewing".

02:10.058 --> 02:12.769
The man's name was Gus Lacey.

02:12.936 --> 02:14.354
What have you seen lately?

02:14.438 --> 02:18.942
Lately, I've been watching
the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland.

02:19.317 --> 02:22.237
Thanks, Mom.
Uh, and it turns...

02:22.279 --> 02:24.406
I got it. I got it.
Mom, I got it.

02:24.656 --> 02:25.532
Thank you.

02:25.991 --> 02:27.575
It turns out...

02:29.285 --> 02:31.287
It's the ghost of a dinosaur.

02:31.788 --> 02:33.373
Okay. Wow.

02:34.749 --> 02:37.168
So, when did this all
start for you, Gus?

02:37.210 --> 02:39.504
It started when I was a kid.

02:39.587 --> 02:41.172
Gus told me that
back in the eighties,

02:41.214 --> 02:44.467
he was part of a top-secret unit
that got their training in the army.

02:44.634 --> 02:47.762
In a program sanctioned
by the highest levels of government.

02:47.929 --> 02:50.890
When I asked him what's the purpose
of this unit was, he said:

02:50.973 --> 02:55.478
We were Psychic Spies, mainly.
That was our initial tasking.

02:55.895 --> 02:58.731
Once they realized
what they were sitting on...

02:59.607 --> 03:02.151
We were trained to kill animals.

03:03.068 --> 03:06.030
- What? With...
- With our minds. That is correct.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.282
Just by staring at them.

03:09.033 --> 03:10.743
What kind of animals?

03:11.327 --> 03:14.580
One of our unit's
stopped the heart of a goat.

03:16.248 --> 03:19.084
Power... they unleashed in us.

03:21.712 --> 03:24.131
Last week I killed my hamster.

03:26.008 --> 03:27.592
You wanna see?

03:29.720 --> 03:31.721
There! Look!

03:31.847 --> 03:33.849
You ever seen a hamster
do that before?

03:34.057 --> 03:37.435
- I've never owned a hamster, Gus, so...
- Just look! Look!

03:37.644 --> 03:39.938
See the way it's glaring
at its wheel.

03:40.021 --> 03:42.482
Yeah, I guess our hamster-owning
readers will know what's...

03:42.524 --> 03:45.652
aberrant behavior and what...
what's...

03:46.486 --> 03:49.614
- Oh, shit! Shit! He's down!
- Yeah, he's down.

03:49.906 --> 03:53.284
At this point I'd been staring at him
for about three hours.

03:54.118 --> 03:55.954
Bizarre, right?

03:56.496 --> 03:57.789
What is that?

03:58.289 --> 03:59.749
It didn't die.
You said, you killed it?

03:59.791 --> 04:00.958
Yeah, well...

04:01.292 --> 04:02.710
Mom said no.

04:02.794 --> 04:04.420
She said:
"Don't show the hamster dying"

04:04.462 --> 04:07.757
"Show the tape where
the hamster acts bizarre instead. "

04:07.882 --> 04:09.884
You should have seen
the Skipper at work.

04:10.009 --> 04:12.303
- Who's the Skipper?
- Lyn Cassady.

04:12.470 --> 04:16.432
For me, after Bill he was the
most gifted psych I've ever met.

04:16.599 --> 04:19.435
He was like an occultic force.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.898
I think he runs a dance studio now.

04:26.692 --> 04:29.653
The little man inside me
dismissed Lacey as a nut.

04:29.862 --> 04:31.280
You know, the little man.

04:31.447 --> 04:34.408
He's the one who says:
"Keep your head down. "

04:34.491 --> 04:37.452
"Stay in your little town,
your little job. "

04:37.703 --> 04:39.997
"You're a lucky guy,
your wife loves you. "

04:40.038 --> 04:42.332
"You have everything you want. "

04:42.416 --> 04:45.168
"You're not looking for
some great adventure. "

04:45.502 --> 04:48.130
"But then, one day...

04:48.338 --> 04:50.757
...when you least expect it,

04:52.008 --> 04:54.553
"The great adventure finds you!"

04:55.053 --> 04:58.014
Ron's sudden death
was the catalyst for everything.

04:58.098 --> 05:01.351
Deborah told me later that
it had been like a wake-up call for her.

05:01.434 --> 05:04.270
What people used to call:
"The memento mori".

05:04.771 --> 05:07.190
Ron's massive coronary
had reminded her that

05:07.232 --> 05:11.027
...life was just too short to
waste any chance of true happiness.

05:11.110 --> 05:14.364
And his death that helped her
to put everything in perspective.

05:25.249 --> 05:27.251
A week after the funeral...

05:27.335 --> 05:29.628
...she left me for my editor.

05:30.046 --> 05:32.339
It seemed like such a tragedy
at the time.

05:32.423 --> 05:34.008
We couldn't see beyond
our little lives...

05:34.049 --> 05:37.720
...to the great events of history
unfolding out there in the world.

05:38.679 --> 05:42.349
I was like a child or a Hobbit,
safe in the Shire.

05:42.975 --> 05:46.353
Or a blond farm boy
in a distant, desert planet,

05:46.437 --> 05:49.314
...unaware that he was already
taking the first steps on the path...

05:49.356 --> 05:52.359
...that would lead him relentlessly
towards the heart of a conflict...

05:52.401 --> 05:55.237
...between the forces of
Good and Evil.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.155
Americans are a resolute people,

05:57.322 --> 06:00.450
...who have risen
to every test of our time.

06:01.034 --> 06:04.162
Adversity has revealed
the character of our country,

06:04.246 --> 06:05.247
...to the world.

06:05.455 --> 06:07.874
Had I known where that path
would lead,

06:08.041 --> 06:12.003
...had a soft wind from my future
brought me the name of Bill Django,

06:12.087 --> 06:13.797
...I might never have gone.

06:13.964 --> 06:15.382
But as it was,

06:15.423 --> 06:17.967
I did what so many men
have done throughout history

06:18.051 --> 06:20.512
...when a woman has broken
their heart...

06:20.970 --> 06:22.972
I went to war.

08:01.152 --> 08:05.030
- So, have you seen any combat?
- Yeah, no it's, uh...

08:05.114 --> 08:07.950
Well, I won't lie to you Debora,
it's been pretty damn hairy.

08:07.992 --> 08:09.869
Yeah. We've been
watching it on Fox.

08:09.910 --> 08:11.912
Yeah, it's not, uh...

08:13.622 --> 08:18.752
I've seen things that
you shouldn't, you know...

08:18.794 --> 08:20.921
Well, I don't even know
why you're there.

08:20.963 --> 08:25.050
Well, I think it's important,
people get an accurate picture of what's

08:25.092 --> 08:27.094
- What?
- Ready to go?

08:27.177 --> 08:29.471
- what's happening, so...
- Yeah.

08:29.554 --> 08:33.350
- So, what is that... is that Dave?
- Yeah.

08:33.517 --> 08:35.227
He says "Hi. "

08:36.937 --> 08:37.938
Oh, that's, huh...

08:37.979 --> 08:40.273
Is he gonna get his stuff
out of here?

08:41.191 --> 08:42.775
That's...

08:45.820 --> 08:47.530
I... I gotta go.

08:47.697 --> 08:49.908
We're moving out, riding up
north to cover the fighting there

08:49.949 --> 08:51.659
Wait, Bob, I'm just...

08:55.747 --> 08:57.749
So, what's a useful phrase?

08:57.874 --> 09:01.127
La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.

09:01.294 --> 09:04.255
- La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.
- Right.

09:04.338 --> 09:08.009
- What's that mean?
- Don't shoot. I'm a reporter.

09:09.802 --> 09:11.804
Okay, that I'll mind.

09:13.806 --> 09:17.768
La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.

09:18.227 --> 09:21.772
I've been waiting for months for
permission to cross the border into Iraq.

09:21.856 --> 09:24.275
All that time, I'd seen
the embedded war correspondents

09:24.316 --> 09:26.735
...coming back,
swapping stories.

09:26.944 --> 09:28.696
They all ignored me.

09:28.779 --> 09:30.531
I had to get into Iraq somehow.

09:30.614 --> 09:33.242
Or I would never again
be able to face myself.

09:33.325 --> 09:37.204
My wife, or that
one-armed fuckhead Dave.

09:37.955 --> 09:41.333
DeWitt Resources, uh,
out of Arkansas.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.919
That's right.
We make trash cans.

09:44.002 --> 09:47.714
You're here for the conference, right?
Looking for a contract?

09:47.798 --> 09:50.217
- I guess.
- What's your pitch?

09:51.134 --> 09:53.428
Well... we're real cheap.

09:56.097 --> 09:58.808
- Bob Wilton.
- Skip.

09:59.017 --> 10:01.436
- Do you mind if I...?
- No.

10:02.646 --> 10:06.191
- So you're from Arkansas?
- No.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.861
- Been here long?
- No.

10:14.115 --> 10:16.117
Be careful what you wish for.

10:16.409 --> 10:18.411
I wanted to prove myself.

10:18.953 --> 10:20.788
And for my sins...

10:21.622 --> 10:23.624
Faith taught me a lesson.

10:27.128 --> 10:29.130
Lyn Cassady?

10:29.380 --> 10:30.965
Lyn Cassady.

10:31.048 --> 10:35.010
For me, after Bill he was the
most gifted psych I've ever met.

10:39.849 --> 10:41.976
Do you know a Gus Lacey?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.731
Skip?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.156
Hello?

10:57.366 --> 11:00.327
Lyn?
I've your hat.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.253
Skip?

11:13.465 --> 11:14.883
- You work for Hooper?
- Hooper? No.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.052
I work for the Ann
Arbor Daily Telegram.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.928
How do you know about Lacey?

11:19.012 --> 11:21.973
I interviewed him a few months ago
for my paper.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.687
Prick.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.023
Follow me.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.776
Let me ask you something.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.863
What color were the chairs
in the hotel bar?

11:41.117 --> 11:43.744
You were in there for hours.
What color were the chairs?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.163
- Green.
- Beige.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.207
How many lights are there
in this room?

11:48.749 --> 11:51.585
A Super Soldier wouldn't have to look.
He would just know.

11:51.627 --> 11:54.463
- A Super Soldier?
- A Jedi Warrior.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.631
He would know
where all the lights were.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.258
He could walk through a room
and he could tell you...

11:57.299 --> 11:59.009
...how many power outlets
there were.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.595
People are walking around
with their eyes closed.

12:01.929 --> 12:06.558
At Level One, we were trained to
instantly absorb all details.

12:06.767 --> 12:10.646
- What's, uh, what's a Jedi Warrior?
- You're looking at one.

12:10.729 --> 12:14.274
- You're a Jedi Warrior?
- That's correct.

12:14.566 --> 12:15.984
I don't...

12:16.568 --> 12:17.736
I don't know what that means.

12:17.819 --> 12:21.782
I'm Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady,
Special Forces, retired.

12:21.865 --> 12:23.825
In the eighties,
I was trained at Fort Bragg

12:23.867 --> 12:27.537
...under a secret initiative
codenamed "Project Jedi. "

12:27.621 --> 12:31.583
The objective of the project
was to create Super Soldiers.

12:31.666 --> 12:33.376
Soldiers with super powers.

12:33.460 --> 12:36.588
We were the first generation
of the New Earth Army.

12:36.755 --> 12:40.008
- You’ve got super powers?
- That's correct.

12:40.175 --> 12:41.759
Wait a minute.

12:43.219 --> 12:45.221
What you saying is that you...

12:45.388 --> 12:47.807
...were a Psychic Spy, like Lacey?

12:47.849 --> 12:50.810
We prefer the term "Remote Viewer. "

12:51.644 --> 12:54.772
- How does that work?
- Well, every Jedi had different techniques.

12:54.856 --> 12:59.277
Mel Landau used to visualize packing
all his troubles into a little suitcase,

12:59.318 --> 13:00.486
...to clear his mind.

13:00.528 --> 13:04.490
Steve Cuttle recite Bible verse
which was...

13:04.573 --> 13:06.158
What about you?

13:06.534 --> 13:09.078
I find... I find drinking helps.
And...

13:09.161 --> 13:11.455
And if I'm listening to
classic rock...

13:11.539 --> 13:15.751
- Oh, yeah? Like who?
- I like Boston. Boston usually works.

13:15.793 --> 13:18.921
What other powers did you practice?

13:19.588 --> 13:21.423
Invisibility.

13:21.673 --> 13:24.510
- Invisibility?
- Yeah. That was Level Three.

13:24.593 --> 13:29.389
- Like... actual invisibility?
- Well, yeah, that was the goal.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.768
Eventually, we adapted it to just
finding a way of not being seen.

13:32.809 --> 13:34.811
But once you understand,

13:34.936 --> 13:39.316
the linkage between observation
and reality,

13:39.524 --> 13:42.652
...then you begin to
dance with invisibility.

13:42.903 --> 13:44.613
Like camouflage?

13:44.779 --> 13:47.741
No. It's not like camouflage.

13:48.158 --> 13:50.285
We also practiced Phasing.

13:50.493 --> 13:53.621
Crossing from particle to wave,
from the physical to energy.

13:53.705 --> 13:56.624
Solid objects seem to pass
right through you.

13:56.666 --> 13:58.960
That starts with a breathing exercise.

14:01.045 --> 14:04.590
Then you think black.
That's the nothingness. Got it?

14:08.845 --> 14:10.847
I don't know what the...

14:11.472 --> 14:13.599
Can I be honest with you, Lyn?

14:13.850 --> 14:14.767
I don't know what to make of this.

14:14.809 --> 14:17.645
I don't know what to say.
This is amazing stuff.

14:17.812 --> 14:19.522
I wanna...

14:21.565 --> 14:23.692
- Could I write a story about this?
- Not gonna happen.

14:23.776 --> 14:25.402
Because, I've been looking
for a story, Lyn.

14:25.444 --> 14:27.279
And I was gonna write
about the re-build contracts...

14:27.321 --> 14:28.781
...but this is much better.
This is much better.

14:28.823 --> 14:31.242
- Not gonna happen.
- All I'm saying is we could meet tomorrow

14:31.283 --> 14:32.993
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

14:33.410 --> 14:35.245
- What? You're going home?
- Going to Iraq.

14:35.287 --> 14:38.248
I've been thinking about partnering
with a factory in Al Qaim.

14:40.626 --> 14:42.920
- I could come.
- What?

14:43.045 --> 14:45.047
- I could come, maybe...
- Look, I don't want to be a story.

14:45.130 --> 14:47.341
- I don't need the attention.
- Look, we could change names, stuff...

14:47.382 --> 14:49.801
Look! There's a war over there, Bob!
Do you understand that?

14:49.885 --> 14:50.886
War!

14:50.969 --> 14:52.554
Now, I don't have to be
looking out for you.

14:52.637 --> 14:56.016
You... you wouldn't have...
I'll look after myself.

14:56.183 --> 14:58.477
I've been in some pretty hairy situations.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.562
I'm a journalist, Lyn.
You understand?

15:00.645 --> 15:03.189
A journalist.
I go where the story is.

15:13.449 --> 15:15.034
What is this?

15:15.618 --> 15:18.454
Nothing. I was just doodling.

15:21.207 --> 15:22.792
What's the matter?

15:23.292 --> 15:24.585
Nothing.

15:41.852 --> 15:44.605
The U.S Army doesn't really have
any serious alternative...

15:44.688 --> 15:46.690
...than to be wonderful!

15:47.358 --> 15:49.193
This does not represent
the official position...

15:49.234 --> 15:52.071
...of the United States Army
at this time.

15:53.655 --> 15:55.491
Bill Django.

15:56.116 --> 15:57.826
Who's Bill Django?

15:58.911 --> 16:00.495
The man who wrote that book.

16:00.746 --> 16:04.124
He said it all started when he
fell out of a helicopter in Vietnam.

16:04.207 --> 16:06.501
Move out!
Go! Go! Go!

16:07.794 --> 16:08.962
Go! Go!

16:09.046 --> 16:11.047
Move!
Move it! Move it!

16:35.571 --> 16:37.573
Fuck you motherfucker!

16:37.782 --> 16:39.367
- Hey, knock it off!
- Hold your fire!

16:39.450 --> 16:42.078
Chris! Knock it off!

16:42.578 --> 16:44.413
Will you knock it off?

16:44.872 --> 16:46.290
Jesus!

16:50.127 --> 16:52.963
- Medic!
- You'll be alright.

16:54.131 --> 16:55.341
Alright!

16:56.801 --> 16:58.385
What are you waiting for?

16:58.469 --> 17:01.180
What the fuck!
Why isn't anyone firing?

17:01.305 --> 17:03.015
Fire!

17:06.185 --> 17:09.021
Every single one of Bill's men
fired high.

17:09.104 --> 17:12.232
They instinctively hadn't wanted
to shoot another person.

17:12.566 --> 17:14.943
Later Bill would come across a study,
which revealed that...

17:14.984 --> 17:18.864
...only 15-20 percent of fresh soldiers
shot to kill.

17:18.906 --> 17:22.159
The rest aimed high,
didn't fire at all,

17:22.242 --> 17:24.994
...or pretended to be
busy doing something else.

17:31.293 --> 17:34.129
I got you, sir.
Stay with me, alright?

17:34.421 --> 17:35.839
I got you.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.841
Hang in there.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.730
Their gentleness...

17:52.814 --> 17:54.816
...is their strength.

18:00.863 --> 18:02.156
While recovering in the hospital,

18:02.198 --> 18:04.825
Bill wrote to the
Vice Chief of Staff for the Army,

18:04.951 --> 18:07.370
explaining that he wanted to go on
a fact-finding mission...

18:07.411 --> 18:10.039
...to explore
alternative combat tactics.

18:10.164 --> 18:13.417
The Pentagon agreed to pay
his salary and expenses.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.544
What Bill hadn't told the Pentagon

18:15.586 --> 18:18.547
...was that he was really looking for
the answer to his vision.

18:18.672 --> 18:20.507
How could his men's gentleness,

18:20.633 --> 18:22.760
...their general lack of interest
in killing people,

18:22.801 --> 18:24.803
...be turned into a strength?

18:24.928 --> 18:28.056
How could love and peace
help win wars?

18:28.223 --> 18:30.851
Bill knew where to go
to find out.

19:10.348 --> 19:14.018
Bill disappeared into the
New Age Movement for six years.

19:14.393 --> 19:17.647
Like all Shaman before him,
he had traversed the wilderness.

19:17.730 --> 19:20.983
Now he was returning to his people,
a changed man.

19:21.275 --> 19:23.152
He brought with him his
confidential report

19:23.194 --> 19:24.487
...which he called:

19:24.570 --> 19:27.198
"The New Earth Army manual. "

19:30.910 --> 19:34.330
The New Earth Army is a banner under
which the forces of good can gather.

19:34.371 --> 19:36.040
The courage and nobility
of the Warrior,

19:36.081 --> 19:38.709
...blended with the
spirituality of the Monk.

19:39.418 --> 19:41.587
The Jedi Warrior will follow
in the footsteps...

19:41.628 --> 19:43.255
...of the great imagineers
of the past:

19:43.297 --> 19:47.384
Jesus Christ, Lao Tse Tung,
Walt Disney...

19:49.887 --> 19:53.682
The role of The New Earth Army is
to resolve conflict world-wide.

19:53.724 --> 19:58.061
Jedi's will parachute into war zones,
utilizing sparkly eyes technique,

19:58.145 --> 20:00.147
...carrying symbolic
flowers and animals,

20:00.230 --> 20:02.858
...playing indigenous music
and words of peace...

20:02.941 --> 20:05.569
What's... What's the
sparkly eyes technique?

20:06.444 --> 20:08.738
Are you ready?
Right.

20:17.247 --> 20:18.790
- Got it?
- Okay.

20:18.831 --> 20:21.125
- You see it? You got it?
- I think, I got it.

20:24.212 --> 20:27.590
As Lyn drove on, I wondered
what the hell I was doing.

20:27.673 --> 20:30.927
I wanted to go back.
This wasn't me, this was crazy.

20:31.010 --> 20:32.720
And so was Lyn.

20:33.095 --> 20:36.974
But, by then, it was too late.
We'd already crossed the border.

20:42.521 --> 20:44.523
What? Does that direct
your powers?

20:44.815 --> 20:45.691
What?

20:45.858 --> 20:48.485
The cone. Does it direct your
psychic powers or something?

20:48.569 --> 20:49.737
No.

20:52.990 --> 20:56.118
It cooks supper.
It's solar.

20:56.952 --> 20:59.246
Utilizing the power of the universe.

20:59.621 --> 21:01.748
No pollution,
totally renewable.

21:01.999 --> 21:04.626
That's New Earth Army technology.

21:10.507 --> 21:12.509
Pretty mind blowing, isn't it?

21:13.135 --> 21:16.096
First time I saw that,
I was like...

21:16.221 --> 21:19.599
- What the fuck?
- Yeah. But, well it's...

21:20.016 --> 21:21.601
But what?

21:22.060 --> 21:25.605
It's just hard to believe
the Pentagon paid for this.

21:25.855 --> 21:28.691
There's nothing in here,
actually about fighting?

21:28.942 --> 21:31.903
The New Earth Army was
tasked with preventing conflict.

21:32.028 --> 21:34.447
We're a force of peace,
not war.

21:34.489 --> 21:36.199
Bill understood
if you want to change the world,

21:36.241 --> 21:39.494
...you've got to start
by changing the armies.

21:39.577 --> 21:42.205
He was the guy that started
the research in the non-lethals.

21:42.288 --> 21:45.249
- Non-lethals?
- Check this out.

21:49.128 --> 21:50.838
- The Predator.
- The Predator?

21:50.922 --> 21:52.757
Lyn, that's just a plastic...

21:52.924 --> 21:54.508
You're mine now.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.802
The predator is 100% biodegradable.

21:56.886 --> 21:59.180
It's friendly to the earth
and it can hurt you in a hundred ways.

21:59.305 --> 22:00.306
Fuck!

22:00.389 --> 22:04.059
It has warrior capacities.
And it looks a little bit funny.

22:04.476 --> 22:06.103
Jesus! Stop it!

22:06.186 --> 22:07.771
- I bought it online.
- Fuck!

22:07.938 --> 22:09.565
The funny thing is, you could see
this just lying on the ground...

22:09.607 --> 22:12.568
...and you'd never know
that it has such lethality.

22:13.944 --> 22:15.529
Eyeballs.

22:19.908 --> 22:22.202
Goddammit!

22:25.747 --> 22:28.375
Well, I guess it's officially night now.

22:30.502 --> 22:32.212
Piece's a shit.

22:52.941 --> 22:56.194
I've got Crohn's.
The steroids help.

22:59.364 --> 23:02.325
Sometimes there's a need, Bob.

23:03.659 --> 23:05.494
Sometimes people are calling
out for something,

23:05.536 --> 23:07.830
...they don't even know
it themselves.

23:09.749 --> 23:14.545
And then a man like Bill
appears out of nowhere,

23:16.130 --> 23:18.132
...because he heard the call.

23:22.511 --> 23:25.764
We are a hollow army, gentlemen.

23:26.724 --> 23:29.018
Vietnam has crushed our soul.

23:29.268 --> 23:32.020
We have to dream a new America.

23:32.146 --> 23:36.441
An America that no longer has an
exploitative view of natural resources.

23:36.483 --> 23:40.445
No longer promotes
consumption at all costs.

23:41.905 --> 23:44.533
But to achieve this dream...

23:45.158 --> 23:49.246
We must become the first Superpower
to develop super powers.

23:49.538 --> 23:52.165
We must create Warrior Monks.

23:52.749 --> 23:56.294
Men and women
who can fall in love with everyone,

23:56.503 --> 24:00.173
...sense plant auras,
pass through walls,

24:00.298 --> 24:04.677
...stop saying mindless cliches
and see into the future.

24:05.637 --> 24:09.724
I want you to
join me in this vision.

24:10.266 --> 24:13.644
Be all you can be.

24:13.853 --> 24:16.314
Amongst Bill’s audience that day
was a Brigadier General...

24:16.355 --> 24:18.191
...from the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

24:18.274 --> 24:19.984
Dean Hopgood.

24:20.067 --> 24:22.195
For some time, the General
had been concerned with...

24:22.236 --> 24:24.864
...Soviet research
into psychic powers.

24:25.281 --> 24:26.532
According to some stories,

24:26.574 --> 24:29.827
...the Soviets had designed
"psychotronic generators. "

24:29.869 --> 24:33.831
Machines capable of bombarding
the President with negative energy.

24:34.039 --> 24:36.333
They were also conducting
sadistic experiments...

24:36.375 --> 24:39.086
...to see whether animals
had psychic powers.

24:39.253 --> 24:40.004
Could they, for instance,

24:40.087 --> 24:43.465
...telepathically detect that their
babies were distressed?

24:44.299 --> 24:46.009
Sick bastards.

24:46.343 --> 24:48.637
But when did the Soviets begin
this type of research?

24:48.720 --> 24:50.139
Well, sir...

24:50.430 --> 24:52.558
It looks like they found out
about our attempt to...

24:52.599 --> 24:55.435
...telepathically communicate with
one of our nuclear subs.

24:55.477 --> 24:57.896
The Nautilus, while it was
under the Polar cap.

24:57.938 --> 24:59.940
- What attempt?
- There was no attempt.

24:59.981 --> 25:02.401
It seems the story
was a French hoax.

25:02.484 --> 25:04.236
But the Russians think
the story about the story...

25:04.277 --> 25:07.405
...being a French hoax
is just a story, sir.

25:07.864 --> 25:09.157
So, they've started psi research...

25:09.199 --> 25:10.825
...because they thought
we were doing psi research,

25:10.867 --> 25:12.619
when in fact we
weren't doing psi research?

25:12.661 --> 25:14.954
Yes, sir. But now that
they're doing psi research,

25:14.996 --> 25:17.624
...we're gonna have to
do psi research, sir.

25:18.166 --> 25:22.253
We can't afford to have the Russians
leading the field in the paranormal.

25:23.171 --> 25:26.924
Two weeks later, the Army adopted
the slogan: "Be all you can be. "

25:27.008 --> 25:31.304
And appointed Bill, Commander of the
first New Earth Army battalion.

25:46.027 --> 25:47.445
Lyn?

25:51.157 --> 25:52.575
Lyn!?

25:58.372 --> 26:01.750
Lyn? Lyn!

26:02.418 --> 26:04.128
What?

26:09.508 --> 26:11.218
Nothing, I...

26:11.593 --> 26:15.138
- What? What are you doing?
- Salute to the sun.

26:16.723 --> 26:19.017
Alright. We're Oscar Mike.

26:19.601 --> 26:22.687
- That's "On the Move", soldier.
- Right.

26:41.623 --> 26:43.207
What are you doing?

26:43.458 --> 26:45.877
Cloud bursting.
Keeps me in shape.

26:45.960 --> 26:49.505
- Really? Which one?
- That one.

26:50.006 --> 26:53.134
- What? This one?
- No. That one. The big one.

26:54.886 --> 26:56.637
Isn't that too far away?

26:56.804 --> 26:58.806
They're all far away.

27:06.647 --> 27:08.357
And it's gone.

27:21.537 --> 27:24.373
Jesus, you had like
the whole desert to drive in, Lyn.

27:24.706 --> 27:26.291
I'm sorry about that Bob.

27:26.500 --> 27:29.127
Must have got a little
bi-locational there.

27:29.294 --> 27:31.922
Don't worry it though.
Somebody will come along soon.

27:38.136 --> 27:40.263
- Heads.
- Right.

27:42.766 --> 27:44.893
- Head.
- Right.

27:46.895 --> 27:51.274
- What's your record at this?
- Two hundred and sixty four. Tails.

27:52.901 --> 27:55.862
Right. Well, that's pretty...

27:59.866 --> 28:01.576
Thank you, Jesus.
Good Jesus!

28:01.659 --> 28:03.661
Please! Please!
Please!

28:03.745 --> 28:06.164
Can you help us?
Can you help?

28:06.247 --> 28:08.541
Can you help?
We drove into a rock.

28:08.708 --> 28:10.835
And I wonder, if you could
take us to some...

28:10.877 --> 28:13.004
...like a town or someplace?

28:14.588 --> 28:16.424
Can we... we get in?
Thank you.

28:16.549 --> 28:18.592
He says fattore.
Fattore, he says.

28:18.676 --> 28:20.678
We can get in.
Come on.

28:25.140 --> 28:29.353
Thank you. Thank you for, uh,
picking us up.

28:29.478 --> 28:31.897
No car's came by.

28:32.064 --> 28:34.483
How... How far is...

28:39.279 --> 28:40.572
Lyn?

28:41.657 --> 28:44.284
- Is this...
- Yeah.

28:49.122 --> 28:50.832
We're gonna die.

28:52.751 --> 28:55.045
We're gonna be killed by Al Qaeda.

28:58.590 --> 29:01.968
- I don't think they're Al Qaeda.
- What the hell do you know?

29:02.344 --> 29:03.636
You don't know.

29:03.845 --> 29:06.389
You don't know!
You don't know anything!

29:06.848 --> 29:08.558
This is all your fault!

29:12.895 --> 29:14.897
Bob, there's something
I have to tell you.

29:15.064 --> 29:18.192
When I said that I was retired
from the unit, that was a lie.

29:18.443 --> 29:19.736
I'm on a mission.

29:19.902 --> 29:22.864
DeWitts was just my cover.
I've been reactivated.

29:23.197 --> 29:25.825
I couldn't tell you
because this is a Black Op.

29:26.117 --> 29:29.787
But I think you have a role to play.
I think that's why you're here.

29:30.496 --> 29:32.081
You're an idiot.

29:32.748 --> 29:34.750
You know why I'm here?

29:35.167 --> 29:39.672
I just wanted to get into Iraq
so I could prove to my wife...

29:39.839 --> 29:41.840
...that I wasn't a...

29:43.008 --> 29:45.010
And now I'm gonna die.

29:45.052 --> 29:48.430
I'm gonna die.
And she's right. I'm such a...

29:48.847 --> 29:50.015
...fuckhead!

29:50.057 --> 29:52.893
Bob, have you ever heard of
"Optimum Trajectory"?

29:53.894 --> 29:55.312
What?

29:56.230 --> 29:58.523
"Optimum trajectory. "

30:01.401 --> 30:03.528
Your life is like a river.

30:03.779 --> 30:05.572
That you're aiming for a goal
that isn't your destiny,

30:05.614 --> 30:07.908
...you'll always gonna be swimming
against the current.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.202
Young Gandhi wants to be
a stock-car racer?

30:10.243 --> 30:11.536
It's not gonna happen.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.288
Little Anne Frank wants to
be a High School teacher.

30:13.330 --> 30:15.457
Tough titty Anne.
That's not your destiny.

30:15.498 --> 30:19.836
But you will go on to move
the hearts and minds of millions.

30:19.878 --> 30:24.674
Find out what your destiny is
and the river will carry you.

30:25.133 --> 30:29.429
Now, sometimes events in life...

30:29.846 --> 30:33.099
...give an individual clues
as to where their destiny lies.

30:33.141 --> 30:35.893
Like those little doodles
you just happened to draw?

30:41.858 --> 30:44.819
It's the Ajna chakra,
the third eye.

30:45.027 --> 30:47.029
The symbol of the Jedi.

30:47.488 --> 30:50.324
When I saw that
you're drawing it, well...

30:50.825 --> 30:53.953
...the Universe gives you clues
like that, you don't ignore it.

30:55.579 --> 30:58.415
You're meant to be here with me, Bob.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.086
It's the Jedi in you
that sensed it.

31:03.253 --> 31:05.881
Now, I don't think these guys
are FRL's or Mahdi Army...

31:05.923 --> 31:07.758
...I think we're talking
standard criminals here.

31:07.841 --> 31:10.260
Which means they're gonna try
to sell us to another group.

31:10.344 --> 31:12.846
- We can't let that happen.
- How are we gonna stop them?

31:12.888 --> 31:15.307
There's three of them!
And they've got guns!

31:15.682 --> 31:16.558
We're Jedi, Bob.

31:16.642 --> 31:19.269
We don't fight with guns.
We fight with our minds.

31:19.436 --> 31:21.021
What do you mean?

31:21.313 --> 31:25.108
Okay, let's say that we have no choice
but to fight with these guys.

31:25.192 --> 31:28.987
We will use visual aesthetics
to instill psychically...

31:29.154 --> 31:32.699
...in the enemy
a disincentive to attack.

31:34.367 --> 31:35.785
What do you mean?

31:35.952 --> 31:38.788
Okay, you pick one of them out,
you lock eyes with him,

31:38.913 --> 31:42.041
...and you go into this monotone
and you're gonna go...

31:43.876 --> 31:46.504
"I'm not going to attack you. "

31:46.838 --> 31:49.799
You relax your body and your voice.

31:52.468 --> 31:53.886
And you just rip out
one of his eyes.

31:53.928 --> 31:56.180
Or you get a pen
and you stab him in the neck,

31:56.222 --> 31:58.057
you create this...
a fountain of blood,

31:58.099 --> 32:00.851
I mean a real fountain, get it
squirting all over his buddies.

32:00.935 --> 32:04.897
That is a psychic disincentive,
right there.

32:05.981 --> 32:07.983
We haven't got a pen.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.153
You're missing the point.

32:11.612 --> 32:13.614
Come here.
Stand up. Come.

32:13.906 --> 32:16.325
Let me show you something.
Alright.

32:16.533 --> 32:18.661
- Choke me.
- I don't want to, Lyn.

32:18.744 --> 32:19.953
Choke me.
What am I gonna do?

32:19.995 --> 32:21.497
I don't know...
there's too many sharp edges.

32:21.538 --> 32:23.957
It's okay.
You can "attack me. "

32:24.124 --> 32:26.126
What's with the quotation fingers?

32:26.293 --> 32:28.837
It's like saying, I'm only capable
of ironic attacking or something.

32:28.879 --> 32:30.464
Choke me!

32:31.965 --> 32:34.092
Well, if I choose to choke you,
what are you gonna do?

32:34.134 --> 32:36.678
I'm gonna interrupt your
thought pattern.

32:51.651 --> 32:53.653
See? I barely moved.

32:54.487 --> 32:56.197
Physics wise,
not much going on here.

32:56.239 --> 32:58.283
It's the psychic energy that's
important. You okay?

32:58.366 --> 33:00.368
- Sharp edges.
- Yeah.

33:01.452 --> 33:04.080
- You felt fear though in the beginning?
- Yes.

33:04.414 --> 33:07.041
Would you say that level of fear
was abnormal?

33:07.083 --> 33:09.502
I don't know. I was pretty
terrified anyway...

33:09.544 --> 33:13.589
...but the fear I felt on the run-up
to the choking was, you know, unusual.

33:13.631 --> 33:14.924
You know why?

33:15.007 --> 33:17.301
Because it wasn't you.
It was me.

33:17.385 --> 33:21.180
I was inside your head.
Fighting with the mind.

33:21.263 --> 33:24.809
- Now, you must always...
- Okay. We'll go.

33:36.320 --> 33:39.156
I'm sorry I freaked out
back there, Lyn.

33:39.323 --> 33:40.908
You learned a lesson.

33:41.366 --> 33:44.036
"Whatever you fear most
has no power over you,

33:44.077 --> 33:46.622
...it's the fear
that has the power. "

33:46.705 --> 33:49.458
- Bill?
- Oprah.

33:51.626 --> 33:54.045
You really don't work
for DeWitts?

33:54.755 --> 33:56.173
Just my cover.

33:56.298 --> 33:58.300
Gus Lacey said
you ran a dance studio.

33:58.341 --> 34:00.051
That was just cover too, right?

34:00.135 --> 34:02.971
No. I do run a dance studio.

34:03.305 --> 34:05.306
I love dancing.

34:06.266 --> 34:08.685
And you're out here
on a mission, right?

34:09.561 --> 34:11.563
In time, Bob.

34:11.813 --> 34:14.857
Did you mean what you said back there
when you said I had some...

34:14.940 --> 34:17.068
...I had some Jedi in me?

34:17.777 --> 34:20.321
We learn to recognize our own kind.

34:20.487 --> 34:22.281
Haven't you always felt like
you were different?

34:22.322 --> 34:23.616
Yes. Yes, I have.

34:23.741 --> 34:25.034
That's the way it is for us.

34:25.118 --> 34:27.745
We're the ones who don't fit in,
when we were kids.

34:27.829 --> 34:29.830
Have you always had powers?

34:30.331 --> 34:31.206
Kind of.

34:31.248 --> 34:33.583
Foxtrot-117 has launched.
Tracking now.

34:33.668 --> 34:36.629
Charlie-Oscar 31.8066667...

34:41.382 --> 34:44.011
Did you crash those computers?

34:46.222 --> 34:47.931
Yes, sir.

34:50.768 --> 34:52.770
Far fucking out!

34:54.021 --> 34:56.565
How would you feel
about a transfer, son?

34:56.732 --> 34:59.985
I am Lieutenant Colonel Bill Django.

35:00.068 --> 35:02.904
If you pass this course...

35:03.071 --> 35:06.199
...you'll be a psychic weapon.

35:06.575 --> 35:10.537
An angel of death,
our enemies worst nightmare!

35:10.871 --> 35:15.250
Until that time, you’re nothing!

35:15.333 --> 35:17.335
Less than nothing!

35:17.877 --> 35:21.840
- Do you understand?
- Sir! Yes, sir!

35:28.138 --> 35:30.557
I'm just kidding about this shit.

35:31.516 --> 35:35.478
Okay, what shall we do now, uh?

35:37.980 --> 35:39.399
Let's dance.

35:40.358 --> 35:41.526
Okay.

35:42.318 --> 35:44.320
Give it everything you've got.

35:44.487 --> 35:45.905
That's it.

35:48.783 --> 35:52.036
- What's your first name, Cassady?
- Lyn, sir.

35:52.286 --> 35:56.582
You've gotta free your feet
before you can free your mind, Lyn.

35:56.624 --> 35:59.043
I'm not really much of a dancer, sir.

35:59.710 --> 36:02.004
That's not true, is it?

36:02.379 --> 36:04.089
You can dance.

36:04.256 --> 36:06.884
It's just someone told you not to.

36:13.056 --> 36:15.893
Stop acting so fucking queer!

36:19.021 --> 36:22.899
Well, I'm your commanding officer,
and I'm ordering you to...

36:22.941 --> 36:25.235
...let the dance out!

36:25.736 --> 36:28.864
Come on, dance!
Goddammit!

36:30.115 --> 36:32.117
Let it go!

36:33.201 --> 36:35.829
Let it go!

36:36.413 --> 36:37.706
That's it!

36:37.831 --> 36:40.125
Welcome to the Heroes Journey, Lyn.

36:40.417 --> 36:45.672
Okay everyone, remember,
we officially do not exist as a unit.

36:45.838 --> 36:49.509
And remember,
no solid food for the first week.

36:57.058 --> 37:00.937
Belgian waffle, ginseng
and amphetamines.

37:01.103 --> 37:04.982
Not to be abused,
but very fucking handy.

37:05.066 --> 37:09.153
There's the opening.
Feel the bend now. You feel it?

37:09.487 --> 37:11.197
That's it! Yeah!

37:16.410 --> 37:20.205
- Think cold!
- Bravo Zulu! Yeah!

37:20.331 --> 37:24.001
Mother Earth, my life support
system as a soldier,

37:24.043 --> 37:28.547
I must drink your blue water,
live inside your read clay,

37:28.630 --> 37:30.757
...and eat your green skin.

37:30.966 --> 37:34.219
Carry my body through
space and time.

37:34.344 --> 37:39.099
You're my connection to the Universe
and all that comes after.

37:39.182 --> 37:44.229
I'm yours and you are mine.
I salute you.

37:52.237 --> 37:54.239
After years of feeling
like an oddball...

37:54.322 --> 37:56.616
...Lyn had finally found a home.

37:57.242 --> 38:01.120
At last he was with men who prided
themselves on being different.

38:02.747 --> 38:04.332
Left shoulder, that's it.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.918
These were Golden Days for Lyn.

38:07.126 --> 38:10.088
There was something so noble
and pure in Bill's vision...

38:10.171 --> 38:13.841
...that the Jedi's felt inspired
to be more than soldiers.

38:14.342 --> 38:16.761
In a world torn apart by
greed and hate...

38:16.928 --> 38:20.306
they would be a force for good,
for peace.

38:20.598 --> 38:24.143
For the first time in his life
Lyn felt truly happy.

38:24.935 --> 38:28.314
Then into the garden
a serpent did come.

38:28.606 --> 38:30.608
Let me finish this.
Let me finish this.

38:30.733 --> 38:33.986
Larry Hooper was a failed Sci-Fi
writer from Colorado,

38:34.194 --> 38:36.405
...recruited to the Jedi
after General Hopgood...

38:36.447 --> 38:38.866
...met him at a
spoon-bending party.

38:42.536 --> 38:45.914
Jesus!

38:46.248 --> 38:48.083
You did this?

38:48.709 --> 38:50.711
You son of a...!

38:51.670 --> 38:52.546
Right from the start...

38:52.629 --> 38:55.590
...he had made himself unpopular
with the rest of the unit.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.762
Congratulations, Scotty. I'm sorry
it doesn't work out between you two.

39:02.681 --> 39:06.351
Larry made it quite clear that
he despised most of the other Jedi's.

39:06.393 --> 39:08.812
Hey, man! How'd you like it
if somebody did that to you?

39:08.853 --> 39:11.689
But Lyn...
Lyn was different.

39:11.856 --> 39:12.857
Fuck off!

39:13.024 --> 39:15.026
He really hated him.

39:17.237 --> 39:20.073
K-9. Scotty?

39:22.116 --> 39:23.701
It's...

39:25.953 --> 39:30.458
- It's something cylindrical? It's a pencil?
- Okay. Larry?

39:36.339 --> 39:40.009
This is Larry's spirit guide, Maud.

39:40.176 --> 39:43.304
I'm looking into the cupboard now.

39:43.679 --> 39:45.681
And I see...

39:47.057 --> 39:48.767
I see...

39:49.226 --> 39:51.228
...a tin mug?

39:52.354 --> 39:53.939
Lyn?

40:03.240 --> 40:05.534
It's a man sitting on a chair.

40:26.221 --> 40:28.389
No, wait a minute.
You said A, not K!

40:28.473 --> 40:32.268
- He said A.
- Bravo Zulu, Lyn. Outstanding.

40:36.147 --> 40:39.525
After a year's training,
Lyn was given his first tasking.

40:39.817 --> 40:43.780
A senior NATO General had been kidnapped
by Red Brigade members in Italy.

40:43.946 --> 40:46.365
Bill was unofficially asked
if his unit would be able to...

40:46.407 --> 40:49.035
...help find him
before it was too late.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.122
We're north of Verona.

40:53.914 --> 40:56.208
It's a small town near a lake.

40:57.460 --> 40:59.462
I can see a cinema.

41:00.629 --> 41:03.465
Across the street from the cinema,
there's a shop.

41:04.258 --> 41:07.219
Or it's a... it's a cafe.

41:07.845 --> 41:10.139
He's in the apartment above the cafe.

41:12.725 --> 41:14.726
The name of the town is...

41:15.310 --> 41:17.020
...it's something sweet.

41:18.188 --> 41:19.773
Dolce.

41:20.774 --> 41:22.776
The name of the town is Dolce.

41:23.902 --> 41:27.030
Bill had never encountered anyone
with such psychic capabilities.

41:27.114 --> 41:29.866
And from that moment on,
Lyn's reputation soared.

41:29.950 --> 41:34.454
Rank, medals... these things
mean little to the Jedi.

41:34.704 --> 41:39.084
But growth in spirit, in wisdom,
in psychic power,

41:39.167 --> 41:42.128
...these are things
that earn our respect.

41:42.253 --> 41:46.549
Native Americans believed that
when one received the Eagle feather,

41:46.633 --> 41:50.720
...it was the mark of love,
of gratitude...

41:50.970 --> 41:53.097
...and ultimate respect.

41:53.598 --> 41:57.143
Only true human beings
may carry the Eagle feather.

41:59.729 --> 42:02.273
- Way to go, Lyn!
- That's great!

42:06.360 --> 42:08.237
The word soon got out in the
intelligence community...

42:08.321 --> 42:10.031
...that there was a sergeant
at Fort Bragg...

42:10.072 --> 42:12.658
...who could find whatever
you needed found.

42:12.742 --> 42:14.869
It was as if Lyn could fly
anywhere in the world...

42:14.910 --> 42:16.745
...without leaving his room.

42:16.871 --> 42:18.164
As Bill said:

42:18.247 --> 42:21.625
the Force truly was strong
with this one.

42:58.912 --> 43:00.080
Lyn?

43:00.163 --> 43:02.916
Don't worry, Bob.
We're not gonna get in that truck.

43:06.502 --> 43:08.338
You don't want us.

43:09.464 --> 43:11.299
You don't want us!

43:16.846 --> 43:19.807
Put your weapon away.

43:20.933 --> 43:22.518
Put your weapon away.

43:22.894 --> 43:24.186
Bob, don't move.

43:24.895 --> 43:26.689
Put your weapon away.
Bob, don't move.

43:26.856 --> 43:29.984
Bob, stay put!
Bob, stop!

43:35.072 --> 43:38.200
La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.

43:49.461 --> 43:50.879
Hold it right there.

43:55.926 --> 43:59.054
Now at the time I thought
Lyn was having some kind of fit here.

43:59.221 --> 44:01.223
Later I discovered
what he was actually doing...

44:01.306 --> 44:03.308
...was performing
the Echmeyer technique.

44:03.558 --> 44:07.938
Ben Echmeyer was a Vietnam vet
with sixty-three confirmed kills.

44:08.063 --> 44:12.692
He remains the only non-Korean to
achieve the rank of Master in Kwa Ra Do.

44:12.859 --> 44:15.820
It's been said he could have
a tug of war with a dozen men...

44:15.945 --> 44:17.655
...and not move an inch.

44:17.739 --> 44:20.575
He was also able to lift bags
of sand on hooks...

44:20.658 --> 44:22.660
...hung through his scrotum.

44:24.871 --> 44:27.165
He was one of the Jedi teachers
at Fort Bragg.

44:27.248 --> 44:30.793
Sir, what is the practical
application of this?

44:31.544 --> 44:34.505
Ben caused quite a stir
by advocating his controversial...

44:34.547 --> 44:36.841
..."shock and awe"
knife attack method.

44:36.966 --> 44:40.511
The approach was hailed by some
knife aficionados as revolutionary

44:40.678 --> 44:44.140
but criticized by others who believed
that the leaping and spinning...

44:44.306 --> 44:47.268
...might lead you to
accidentally stab yourself.

44:49.603 --> 44:53.148
Lyn Cassady, however,
became a firm convert to the style.

44:53.357 --> 44:57.236
Of course, Lyn didn't actually have
a knife with him at this particular time.

44:57.403 --> 45:00.030
So, I still think that
what he did was kind of...

45:00.072 --> 45:01.365
...reckless.

45:03.700 --> 45:05.410
Throw your hands up!

45:09.915 --> 45:11.500
You idiot.

45:13.251 --> 45:15.379
Shit! Shit!
They are not coming!

45:15.545 --> 45:18.673
We're okay. We're okay.
They're not coming! We'll be alright.

45:21.635 --> 45:23.053
Oh, shit!

45:28.350 --> 45:29.642
There he is.

45:30.268 --> 45:33.646
Sir, it's okay!
We're Americans.

45:33.813 --> 45:35.231
We're here to help you!

45:35.899 --> 45:37.066
Sir!?

45:38.109 --> 45:39.485
Sir, will you...

45:39.736 --> 45:40.903
Oh, crap!

45:41.029 --> 45:44.282
- What happened? What happened?
- I think I just ran him over.

45:44.532 --> 45:45.742
Sir?

45:47.118 --> 45:48.536
Are you alright, sir?

45:48.661 --> 45:49.954
Bob, give me a hand.

45:50.079 --> 45:52.081
Come on! Help him up!
Get him up here!

45:52.248 --> 45:54.500
Bring him up!
Bring him up!

45:55.209 --> 45:57.837
Shit! Shit!
Who is that?

46:05.511 --> 46:07.096
Don't move!

46:09.473 --> 46:11.767
Let's see your hands!
Now!

46:22.110 --> 46:24.738
Todd Nixon,
Army small business office.

46:26.448 --> 46:27.866
Mahmud Daash.

46:28.033 --> 46:30.452
Ask me what business I'm in,
Muhammad.

46:30.535 --> 46:33.538
Mahmud.
What business are you in, sir?

46:33.622 --> 46:36.875
Right now, I'm in the
quality of life business.

46:37.542 --> 46:40.837
We've got over 25 million Iraqis out
here who wanna be independent,

46:40.879 --> 46:42.714
...wanna make something
for themselves.

46:42.839 --> 46:45.383
More than anything else
they wanna buy stuff.

46:45.467 --> 46:47.886
Cell phones, digital cameras,
leisure suits... you name it.

46:47.927 --> 46:50.763
If it sells in Boston,
we can damn well sell it in Baghdad.

46:50.805 --> 46:52.098
Am I right, Muhammad?

46:52.182 --> 46:53.016
He knows what I'm talking about.

46:53.057 --> 46:56.019
We've got Halliburton, Parsons,
Perini... just in the primes.

46:56.060 --> 46:58.604
We're gonna have McDonald's,
we're gonna have Starbucks...

46:58.730 --> 47:01.858
No corporate tax.
It's gonna be a gold rush.

47:02.233 --> 47:05.069
Oh, and by the way, fuck the French!
Did you hear that shit?

47:05.111 --> 47:07.530
Chirac wants to bring
French contractors in?

47:07.822 --> 47:10.658
Hey, Phil, what's the most common
French expression?

47:10.741 --> 47:12.326
"I give up. "

47:13.286 --> 47:17.498
That's fucking funny.
Year zero, guys. Year zero.

47:18.207 --> 47:22.586
Okay, we're in Indian country now.
Check your six.

47:25.422 --> 47:27.967
We've got a line of cars
at the gas station here.

47:28.008 --> 47:29.176
You guys wanna wait?

47:29.551 --> 47:31.387
Negative.
We're too exposed.

47:31.512 --> 47:34.473
We're taking the station.
Go in fangs out!

47:54.951 --> 47:56.953
Secure the perimeter!

48:08.047 --> 48:10.174
- Give her the go-juice, Eddy!
- I filled her up last time.

48:10.216 --> 48:13.886
- That's bullshit.
- He did fill her up last time, Gary.

48:15.054 --> 48:17.348
With all due respect, sir,
bull-fucking-shit. I tanked her last time.

48:17.390 --> 48:18.391
- Bullshit!
- Every time!

48:18.433 --> 48:21.060
Can we figure out
some kind of fucking system!?

48:21.644 --> 48:24.063
Contact! Contact!
We've got contact!

48:24.689 --> 48:26.399
Where is the shooter?

48:29.360 --> 48:31.362
And what became known
as the Battle of Ramadi,

48:31.404 --> 48:34.365
twelve people were injured.
Mostly locals.

48:34.573 --> 48:36.075
Both security companies claimed...

48:36.117 --> 48:38.953
...they had been fired upon
first by Iraqis.

48:39.036 --> 48:40.329
Of course, it was later
revealed that...

48:40.371 --> 48:42.790
...they had actually
fired upon each other.

48:45.209 --> 48:46.502
One down!

48:47.294 --> 48:50.255
My house is not far.
We could walk from here.

48:50.297 --> 48:52.716
- Sounds good, Muhammad.
- Mahmud.

48:54.301 --> 48:57.429
As we ran for cover,
I thought this was what I wanted.

48:57.512 --> 48:58.263
I was on a mission,

48:58.347 --> 49:00.766
...even if I didn't know
what kind of mission it was.

49:00.849 --> 49:03.268
But I could hear
the little man inside me again.

49:03.435 --> 49:05.854
He was screaming
like a little girl.

49:08.982 --> 49:11.610
Krom One! Krom One!
This is Freedom Frontier.

49:11.693 --> 49:12.569
We are under attack.

49:12.652 --> 49:14.654
This is fucking fubar!

49:51.565 --> 49:53.275
Muhammad led us
to his home...

49:53.359 --> 49:56.362
...which as it turned out
had been robbed in his absence.

49:56.445 --> 50:00.115
And also, accidentally
shot up in a fire fight.

50:01.116 --> 50:03.869
Neighbors told him that
his wife had left,

50:03.952 --> 50:06.246
...they weren't sure
where she had gone.

50:18.175 --> 50:21.136
I'm very sorry
for running you over, sir.

50:22.888 --> 50:24.890
It was an accident.

50:25.515 --> 50:29.394
And I apologize for that
security detachment.

50:29.853 --> 50:33.398
I don't want you to think that
all Americans are like that.

50:34.649 --> 50:38.444
I apologize for the kidnappers.

50:39.237 --> 50:41.072
Not your fault, sir.

50:41.698 --> 50:45.243
I mean, we've
kidnappers in America and...

50:45.576 --> 50:48.705
There's always... bad apples.

51:21.236 --> 51:24.072
Lyn? Are you awake?

51:27.159 --> 51:31.038
I was just...
thinking about Mahmud.

51:33.373 --> 51:35.208
They're just trying to do
something with their lives.

51:35.292 --> 51:39.087
Something... lasting, good.

51:40.088 --> 51:42.716
But there's always somebody
who wants to smash it up.

51:43.717 --> 51:46.344
What Lyn was really thinking
about was Larry Hooper.

51:46.386 --> 51:50.056
And the part he had played in the
destruction of the New Earth Army.

51:50.348 --> 51:52.767
But, in fairness,
the Jedi's own eccentricities...

51:52.809 --> 51:55.436
...hadn't exactly won
them many allies.

51:55.812 --> 51:57.814
For example,
there was Tim Kootz,

51:57.897 --> 52:00.191
who, on being asked to ascertain
the whereabouts of...

52:00.275 --> 52:03.528
...General Manuel
Noriega, had replied,

52:05.738 --> 52:09.283
- Ask Angela Lansbury.
- Say again, Tim?

52:09.617 --> 52:12.161
Ask Angela Lansbury.

52:15.539 --> 52:17.958
Excellent. Excellent.

52:29.136 --> 52:31.430
We asked Angela Lansbury.

52:31.513 --> 52:32.389
And?

52:32.473 --> 52:36.018
She said she didn't know
where General Noriega was.

52:44.151 --> 52:47.279
Or there was the time Major
General Gilling was visiting the base.

52:47.529 --> 52:49.823
And saw Jedi trainee
Clifford Hickox...

52:49.948 --> 52:53.743
...practicing the ancient Sun
Dance of the Sioux Nation.

52:54.077 --> 52:56.079
The Jedi's survived
such minor scandals,

52:56.121 --> 52:58.540
...protected, it was rumored,
by President Reagan.

52:58.707 --> 53:00.542
Who was a fan of both
the Star Wars films...

53:00.584 --> 53:02.877
...and the paranormal himself.

53:03.211 --> 53:06.673
But then, one summer,
a young, likable Lieutenant...

53:06.715 --> 53:10.385
...named Norman Pendleton was
recruited to the New Earth Army.

53:11.886 --> 53:13.888
Desperate to compete with Lyn,

53:13.972 --> 53:19.143
Larry had been doing research into
the infamous CIA MK-ULTRA experiments

53:19.310 --> 53:22.855
...which he believed could enhance
his own psychic powers.

53:23.106 --> 53:25.650
All he needed was a lab rat
to try them out on.

53:25.691 --> 53:27.693
To check if they were safe.

53:29.737 --> 53:32.031
It turned out they weren't.

54:02.352 --> 54:04.187
Run! Run!

54:05.939 --> 54:07.232
Bullshit!

54:17.951 --> 54:19.536
Norm?

54:23.415 --> 54:24.999
Norm.

54:25.416 --> 54:27.418
Give me the gun.

54:33.967 --> 54:35.677
Norm’s father,
who had turned out...

54:35.718 --> 54:38.971
...was pretty high up in the
Pentagon, wanted blood.

54:39.138 --> 54:42.016
Although the Jedi's were pretty
sure Larry was responsible,

54:42.099 --> 54:43.559
...nothing could be proved.

54:43.684 --> 54:46.938
And when he was called to
testify at the disciplinary hearing,

54:46.979 --> 54:49.815
...Larry made sure to smear Bill
with everything he could.

54:49.899 --> 54:53.110
Lieutenant Colonel Django used funds
from the project's black budget...

54:53.152 --> 54:55.029
- to procure prostitutes...
- That's a lie!

54:55.070 --> 54:57.364
...and to get drugs for himself
and his men.

54:57.406 --> 54:58.991
That...

54:59.408 --> 55:02.786
Well, the hooker thing is
definitely a lie.

55:05.205 --> 55:08.459
Brigadier General Hopgood resigned
and died some years later.

55:08.584 --> 55:11.545
Bill received a dishonorable discharge.

55:20.053 --> 55:22.347
Continue the work, Lyn.

55:24.141 --> 55:27.269
The World needs the Jedi's, now,
more than ever.

55:33.525 --> 55:34.526
After Bill left,

55:34.609 --> 55:38.488
Major Holtz of Special Forces
took command of the Jedi's.

55:39.572 --> 55:42.325
He didn't think much of Bill's
unconventional training techniques...

55:42.408 --> 55:44.953
...and he's about to
make some changes.

55:46.955 --> 55:49.582
Nothing was ever the same again.

56:47.055 --> 56:49.057
I really appreciate this, sir.

57:36.562 --> 57:38.856
Jesus!
We could have bought a map.

57:39.231 --> 57:42.109
Bedouins have been navigating
this desert for centuries...

57:42.192 --> 57:43.610
...without a map.

57:43.735 --> 57:46.029
You can use a wristwatch in
conjunction with the sun.

57:46.113 --> 57:47.281
Well?

57:47.447 --> 57:49.866
- Well, what?
- Well, use your wristwatch.

57:50.033 --> 57:51.451
I haven't got a wristwatch.

57:51.576 --> 57:53.161
Oh, for the love of...

57:53.829 --> 57:54.996
Here.

57:56.540 --> 57:57.707
What?

57:58.125 --> 57:59.709
- It's digital.
- So?

57:59.793 --> 58:01.503
You need a watch with hands.

58:01.628 --> 58:04.256
How am I supposed to know?
You're the navigation expert.

58:04.297 --> 58:05.840
You're the one who said
you could...

58:05.882 --> 58:07.050
...find a way.

58:07.133 --> 58:09.302
- I'll, if you'd just be quiet...
- Turns out you haven't even got a watch!

58:09.344 --> 58:10.345
- I don't need a watch.
- How the hell we'll get of here?

58:10.387 --> 58:11.971
I'm using Level Two.

58:12.097 --> 58:14.307
- What is that?
- Level Two. Intuition.

58:14.349 --> 58:16.142
We were trained to make
correct decisions.

58:16.184 --> 58:17.352
Somebody runs up to you...

58:17.393 --> 58:18.478
...and they say
"There's a fork in the road. "

58:18.519 --> 58:20.688
Do we go left or do we go right?
And you go...

58:20.730 --> 58:21.522
"We go right!"

58:21.606 --> 58:24.734
- What? Just instant?
- Instant. Just like that.

58:26.235 --> 58:29.614
We've been sitting here for half an hour.
How's that "instant?"

58:32.325 --> 58:33.784
- Oh, it's this way?
- Yeah.

58:33.868 --> 58:35.578
Oh, now you know.

59:08.777 --> 59:10.070
Hang on.

59:13.073 --> 59:14.366
What happened?

59:14.699 --> 59:16.535
- IED.
- What?

59:16.743 --> 59:20.622
- Improvised Explosive Device.
- Oh, Jesus! Jesus!

59:20.705 --> 59:22.832
You're okay.
You're gonna be okay.

59:22.916 --> 59:23.958
I can't believe it.

59:24.125 --> 59:25.835
Great fucking intuition, Lyn.

59:25.919 --> 59:28.755
I can't... put me down.
I can walk.

59:29.255 --> 59:31.090
Oh, Jesus!

59:31.841 --> 59:33.843
I think I may be
bleeding to death.

59:34.218 --> 59:36.346
You're not bleeding to death.
You're in shock.

59:36.471 --> 59:37.764
It's a shock.

59:38.181 --> 59:40.808
It's hot.
I'm so hot.

59:40.933 --> 59:42.935
- Aren't you hot?
- Bob?

59:43.102 --> 59:45.396
It's really important
you keep your mouth closed.

59:45.605 --> 59:48.024
You can lose a lot of water
through an open mouth.

59:48.107 --> 59:50.651
If we'd only stayed with the car
then...

59:50.693 --> 59:51.777
...we would be alright now.

59:51.861 --> 59:54.405
- Now we've no water, no...
- You're gonna be okay.

59:54.488 --> 59:56.198
Would you stop saying that?
I've been...

59:56.282 --> 59:58.117
I've been got blown up!
I'm in the middle of a desert!

59:58.159 --> 01:00:01.245
- I'm not gonna be okay.
- Bob, you're in shock.

01:00:01.328 --> 01:00:03.956
If you panic,
your heart's gonna stop.

01:00:04.373 --> 01:00:07.209
Is that supposed to calm me down?

01:00:07.835 --> 01:00:09.128
Wait a minute.

01:00:10.546 --> 01:00:12.131
This is west.

01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:14.800
Al Qaim is the other way.
We're going the wrong way.

01:00:14.842 --> 01:00:18.512
Al Qaim isn't the mission.
We're going near Al Qaim.

01:00:18.637 --> 01:00:20.222
Where?

01:00:21.056 --> 01:00:23.350
- I don't know.
- What?

01:00:23.433 --> 01:00:25.519
Is that a joke?
This is a joke, right?

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.939
We've come 600 miles and
you don't know where we're going?

01:00:30.899 --> 01:00:34.027
If the exact whereabouts of the
target was known...

01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:37.072
...it wouldn't take a Jedi
to find them, would it?

01:00:37.781 --> 01:00:39.783
Who gave you the mission, Lyn?

01:00:40.533 --> 01:00:42.660
- Bill did it.
- What?

01:00:42.827 --> 01:00:46.206
Bill... He appeared in my
trailer two months ago.

01:00:46.331 --> 01:00:48.333
A psychic projection.

01:00:48.499 --> 01:00:51.127
- He called out my name.
- Oh, Jesus!

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:53.338
Lyn, there is no mission.

01:00:53.546 --> 01:00:57.341
We're in the middle of the fucking desert
because you heard voices?

01:00:57.508 --> 01:01:02.013
There's no one here!
There's no one fucking here!

01:01:03.264 --> 01:01:05.391
When the dust of Bill's discharge
has settled...

01:01:05.433 --> 01:01:08.060
...it revealed a surprising victor.

01:01:09.562 --> 01:01:11.689
What you've for me, sergeant?

01:01:11.939 --> 01:01:14.150
This is a scientific report
I've done...

01:01:14.233 --> 01:01:17.194
...on possible offensive
psi application, sir.

01:01:17.278 --> 01:01:20.239
I showed it to Lieutenant Colonel Django,
but he didn't seem interested.

01:01:20.322 --> 01:01:22.616
No, I bet he wasn't.

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:29.289
We have men who can do this?

01:01:29.456 --> 01:01:31.458
I can think of one, sir.

01:01:32.668 --> 01:01:35.295
But we don't have the resources.

01:01:37.005 --> 01:01:38.590
Well, sir...

01:01:38.757 --> 01:01:40.759
...there is the goat lab.

01:01:42.844 --> 01:01:46.640
Just 80 yards from Major Holtz's
office was an abandoned hospital.

01:01:46.807 --> 01:01:49.100
Most of the soldiers
who lived and worked in Fort Bragg

01:01:49.142 --> 01:01:51.770
...had no idea about the
actual function of this building.

01:01:51.853 --> 01:01:53.980
Because,
although it was abandoned,

01:01:54.105 --> 01:01:56.399
...the hospital was not empty.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:00.987
The goats have been secretly flown in
from Central America to avoid customs.

01:02:01.112 --> 01:02:04.365
Special forces weren't worried about
regular soldiers hearing the goats...

01:02:04.449 --> 01:02:06.576
...because they'd been de-bleated.

01:02:06.868 --> 01:02:09.829
Goat Lab was originally created
as a secret laboratory,

01:02:09.954 --> 01:02:14.167
...to provide in-the-field surgical
training for Special Forces soldiers.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.878
The goats would get shot
in the leg with a bolt gun...

01:02:16.961 --> 01:02:20.339
...and then a trainee would have
to dress the wound successfully.

01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:23.217
Goat lab actually used to be
called Dog Lab.

01:02:23.301 --> 01:02:27.179
But it turned out most soldiers didn't
feel good shooting dogs in the leg.

01:02:27.722 --> 01:02:31.267
The army, though, had long felt
fine about doing stuff to goats.

01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:34.186
Even testing atomic weapons
on them.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.190
It's gone, Bob.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.275
What?

01:02:40.484 --> 01:02:42.069
I can't find him.

01:02:42.444 --> 01:02:44.446
I've lost my powers.

01:02:45.072 --> 01:02:46.657
It's a curse.

01:02:47.032 --> 01:02:47.908
What curse?

01:02:48.033 --> 01:02:50.327
They took this, beautiful thing
that we've been building...

01:02:50.369 --> 01:02:52.996
...and they destroyed the
New Earth Army.

01:02:53.038 --> 01:02:54.873
Who destroyed it?

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.085
I did.

01:03:00.295 --> 01:03:03.131
Hooper and Holtz wanted me
to do an experiment.

01:03:03.381 --> 01:03:05.383
They wanted me to
stop the heart of a goat.

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:07.052
What had the goat ever done to me?

01:03:07.135 --> 01:03:10.096
It was completely against
the way of the Jedi.

01:03:10.305 --> 01:03:11.598
I was just gonna pretend to try...

01:03:11.681 --> 01:03:14.517
...so that they can see it wouldn't work
and they can forget about it.

01:03:14.684 --> 01:03:17.312
Then, as I sat there...

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.481
I felt this... pulse

01:03:20.565 --> 01:03:23.192
...inside me.
I couldn't stop it.

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:28.031
Maybe deep down inside...

01:03:28.156 --> 01:03:32.243
...some dark part of me
wanted to see if I could do it?

01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:57.434
Holy shit!

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:02.981
That was it.
I'd used my powers for evil and...

01:04:03.106 --> 01:04:05.943
...as if I brought a curse
on us all.

01:04:06.902 --> 01:04:08.737
It's like that poem where...

01:04:08.862 --> 01:04:12.115
...the guy kills the seagull and they
make him wear it round his neck.

01:04:12.574 --> 01:04:15.202
Every night I'd dream of that goat.

01:04:15.243 --> 01:04:19.331
It's mouth opening and closing
without making a sound.

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:22.000
The silence of the goats.

01:04:26.004 --> 01:04:28.548
I finished my tour and I quit.
I walked out.

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:29.799
I never went back.

01:04:31.885 --> 01:04:33.470
But before he could leave,

01:04:33.553 --> 01:04:36.389
Larry arranged one last parting gift.

01:04:37.348 --> 01:04:38.516
What do you...?

01:04:45.398 --> 01:04:46.983
It was the Dim Mak.

01:04:47.108 --> 01:04:49.235
- The Dim Mak?
- The Dim Mak.

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:50.903
The Quivering Palm.

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:52.154
The Death Touch.

01:04:52.196 --> 01:04:54.448
It's forbidden in the New Earth Army.

01:04:54.532 --> 01:04:56.659
What does the Death Touch do?

01:04:57.243 --> 01:04:58.828
It kills you, Bob.

01:04:59.078 --> 01:05:01.497
- With one touch.
- Jesus!

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:05.459
There's a story that Wong Wifu,
the great Chinese martial artist,

01:05:05.584 --> 01:05:08.128
...had a fight with a guy
and beat him.

01:05:08.212 --> 01:05:11.882
Then the guy gave him
this light tap.

01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:15.177
Wong looked at him
and the guy just nodded.

01:05:15.469 --> 01:05:16.887
That was it.

01:05:17.096 --> 01:05:19.389
He had given him the death touch.

01:05:20.098 --> 01:05:21.517
Wong died.

01:05:22.142 --> 01:05:23.727
Then and there?

01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:25.520
No.

01:05:25.729 --> 01:05:27.731
About eighteen years later.

01:05:28.106 --> 01:05:29.274
That's the thing about Dim Mak...

01:05:29.316 --> 01:05:31.735
...you never know
when it's gonna take effect.

01:05:37.782 --> 01:05:40.619
In a funny kind of way
I admired Lyn then.

01:05:40.744 --> 01:05:42.203
He believed in something
so much...

01:05:42.245 --> 01:05:44.664
...he thought he could
really die from it.

01:05:45.957 --> 01:05:48.251
That's what I've been looking
for all along.

01:05:48.418 --> 01:05:50.128
Something to believe in.

01:05:50.295 --> 01:05:52.839
Something to give meaning
to my life.

01:05:53.881 --> 01:05:56.426
So I had fallen for
Lyn's crazy stories.

01:05:56.551 --> 01:05:59.512
So I'd followed him
out into the desert.

01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:32.336
Look! Look!

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.925
Come on! Come on!

01:07:26.389 --> 01:07:30.059
These are friendly competitions
held between members of the camp.

01:07:30.142 --> 01:07:34.021
When you think this sorta things for kids,
you better think again.

01:08:04.217 --> 01:08:05.385
Lyn?

01:08:13.018 --> 01:08:14.853
Lyn? Where are you going?

01:08:20.942 --> 01:08:22.109
Lyn?

01:09:07.196 --> 01:09:08.779
Hello, Bill.

01:09:12.451 --> 01:09:14.036
Hello, Lyn.

01:09:17.038 --> 01:09:18.622
This is Bob.

01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:20.834
Hello, Bob.

01:09:21.751 --> 01:09:23.336
Hello.

01:09:25.546 --> 01:09:26.840
Oh, good.

01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:29.091
The gang's all here.

01:09:30.593 --> 01:09:33.555
This is primarily a Psyops base.

01:09:33.763 --> 01:09:36.724
- Psy for psychic, right?
- Psy for psychological.

01:09:36.808 --> 01:09:38.725
The irony isn't wasted on me.

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:41.354
Radio broadcasts, leaflets,
things like that.

01:09:41.437 --> 01:09:45.524
Oh, here's an Iraqi Psyops leaflet
they dropped on us.

01:09:46.109 --> 01:09:47.819
"American soldier...

01:09:48.027 --> 01:09:48.944
...your wives are back at home...

01:09:48.986 --> 01:09:51.072
...having sex with Bart Simpson
and Bert Reynolds. "

01:09:51.113 --> 01:09:53.950
Yeah, didn't exactly done their
homework there.

01:09:54.367 --> 01:09:55.785
How did you find us, Lyn?

01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:58.204
I told you,
I remote viewed you.

01:09:58.329 --> 01:10:00.748
If this is Psyops base,
what are you doing here?

01:10:00.873 --> 01:10:03.501
I said it was primarily Psyops.

01:10:03.793 --> 01:10:05.920
There are individuals in the
current administration...

01:10:05.961 --> 01:10:08.923
...who're looking for creative solutions
to the war on terror.

01:10:09.006 --> 01:10:11.550
They're far more open minded
than their predecessors,

01:10:11.592 --> 01:10:15.137
...and they've outsourced
experimental research to my company.

01:10:15.262 --> 01:10:16.847
"Sick?"

01:10:17.765 --> 01:10:19.767
It's pronounced psi-ike.

01:10:20.309 --> 01:10:24.813
Psychic Systems International Corp.
"PSIC".

01:10:25.564 --> 01:10:28.817
It turns out certain people had
heard about the New Earth Army.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.320
They were very interested in some
of the work we were doing back then.

01:10:31.361 --> 01:10:33.989
They got a hold on me,
I got a hold on Bill.

01:10:35.574 --> 01:10:37.159
Bill works for you?

01:10:37.242 --> 01:10:40.620
Bill's looking into
subliminal messaging.

01:10:41.746 --> 01:10:43.039
This is the one we've designed...

01:10:43.081 --> 01:10:45.542
...to play to our own troops
before going into combat.

01:10:45.625 --> 01:10:47.210
Push "play" on that.

01:10:53.967 --> 01:10:56.094
There's a subliminal message in this?

01:10:56.177 --> 01:10:57.262
This one's called...

01:10:57.345 --> 01:11:00.306
"Don't get drunk before
firing heavy machine guns. "

01:11:00.515 --> 01:11:03.059
We've got all sorts of new ideas
and development.

01:11:03.142 --> 01:11:04.519
Give them one of our new ideas.

01:11:04.602 --> 01:11:06.312
- Air bag mine?
- Air bag mine.

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:07.688
Non-lethal.

01:11:07.939 --> 01:11:10.358
Catapults the fucker right into the air.
Gimme another one.

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:13.027
Blast target with pheromones and
then release attack bees.

01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:17.156
Excellent. Attack bees.
The forces of nature!

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:18.824
- Another.
- Project Achilles.

01:11:18.949 --> 01:11:22.495
- We mutilate enemy corpses...
- We're not doing that anymore! You idiot!

01:11:23.787 --> 01:11:27.583
The point is... we've got a budget,
we've got supporters.

01:11:27.666 --> 01:11:29.293
I'm rebuilding the New Earth Army.

01:11:29.376 --> 01:11:31.211
Only this time without
all that hippie crap.

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:35.132
- How you're doing there, Bill?
- Gonna get some ice-cream.

01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:45.726
You get the occasional flash of
what he used to be but...

01:11:45.809 --> 01:11:48.228
...he's pretty burnt out
on the booze.

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:51.565
Still, he's the best.
Oh, twizzlers.

01:11:53.316 --> 01:11:55.151
- You want one?
- No.

01:11:55.318 --> 01:11:56.903
God, I love these things.

01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:54.084
What? What is it?

01:12:54.835 --> 01:12:56.837
It's the Dark Side.

01:13:08.098 --> 01:13:10.100
Lyn, what you're gonna do?

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.435
It's too late...

01:13:15.146 --> 01:13:18.274
- I'm dying, Bob.
- No, you're not gonna die.

01:13:18.775 --> 01:13:20.485
I don't believe
you can be killed by...

01:13:20.568 --> 01:13:23.113
- by mail order, Dim Sum, or...
- Dim Mak.

01:13:23.196 --> 01:13:25.490
Dim Mak. Whatever.
You can't just be tapped in the shoulder

01:13:25.532 --> 01:13:27.242
It's cancer.

01:13:28.451 --> 01:13:29.744
What?

01:13:31.204 --> 01:13:34.332
All I know it's the Dim Mak
that caused it.

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:36.918
It's cancer.

01:13:37.251 --> 01:13:39.378
At least that's what the doctors said.

01:13:43.382 --> 01:13:45.801
It's different ways
of looking at...

01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:49.555
Different names for a reality.

01:14:04.486 --> 01:14:06.071
Give that to Bill.

01:14:07.281 --> 01:14:08.866
I don't deserve it.

01:14:12.911 --> 01:14:14.496
Take it.

01:14:22.212 --> 01:14:24.047
It wasn't the Dim Mak
that was killing Lyn.

01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:26.132
And it wasn't the cancer.

01:14:26.216 --> 01:14:28.677
He was dying of a broken heart.

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.388
And maybe, the cancer as well.

01:14:31.888 --> 01:14:33.598
His mission had failed.

01:14:33.807 --> 01:14:36.768
And failure was something
I knew too much about.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.853
Bill?

01:15:00.458 --> 01:15:03.586
Lyn told me he didn't deserve
this eagle feather.

01:15:04.712 --> 01:15:07.006
He wanted me to
give it back to you.

01:15:09.175 --> 01:15:11.802
- It's fake.
- What?

01:15:13.721 --> 01:15:17.516
Twenty thousand dollar fine
for taking an eagle feather.

01:15:17.766 --> 01:15:19.768
This one's off a turkey.

01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:23.564
You just die the tip black.

01:15:26.024 --> 01:15:27.609
Don't tell Lyn.

01:15:29.403 --> 01:15:31.113
It isn't real.

01:15:32.739 --> 01:15:34.741
None of it was real.

01:15:40.163 --> 01:15:42.457
Lyn told me about the curse.

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:46.503
That by killing the goat,
he put a curse on all of you.

01:15:49.047 --> 01:15:51.674
What's Larry gonna do
with these goats?

01:15:58.139 --> 01:16:00.433
Do you believe in redemption, Bill?

01:16:25.082 --> 01:16:27.376
Sorry.
Didn’t mean to wake you.

01:16:29.545 --> 01:16:31.130
How did you find it?

01:16:31.505 --> 01:16:34.133
I told you,
I remote viewed you.

01:16:34.967 --> 01:16:37.261
Scotty Mercer told you, didn't he?

01:16:38.011 --> 01:16:39.596
Yeah, he did.

01:16:40.139 --> 01:16:41.557
We told Scotty
we were coming over here,

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:43.600
...asked him
if he wanted some work.

01:16:43.684 --> 01:16:45.686
I haven't seen Scotty.

01:16:46.395 --> 01:16:49.523
That's funny, because he told me
he'd run into you and mentioned that

01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:52.234
...there might be some jobs
going over with.

01:16:53.068 --> 01:16:56.446
Isn't that why you came,
really, Lyn?

01:16:58.323 --> 01:17:00.450
You want back in, don't you?

01:17:01.368 --> 01:17:02.661
It can happen.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:04.829
You've only got to say the word.

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:08.625
This could be the new Golden
Age for psi research.

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:11.044
You, me and Bill,
back together again.

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:13.129
Like the old days.

01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:21.888
You don't have to make a
decision now.

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:24.932
Tell me in the morning.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:38.154
Mother Earth,
you're my life support system.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:41.198
As a soldier
I must drink your blue water,

01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:45.786
...live inside your red clay
and eat your green skin.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.997
Help me to balance myself.

01:17:48.122 --> 01:17:51.500
As you hold in balance,
the Earth, the sea,

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:53.711
...and the space environments.

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:55.921
Help me to open my heart...

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:58.757
...knowing that
the Universe will feed me.

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:02.344
I pray my boots
will always kiss your face...

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:05.472
...and my footsteps match
your heartbeat.

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:09.059
Carry my body through
space and time.

01:18:09.267 --> 01:18:13.605
You're my connection to the Universe
and all that comes after.

01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:16.316
I'm yours and you are mine.

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:18.652
I salute you.

01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:24.115
I salute you.

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:33.791
Bill?

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:35.752
Bill! Bill?

01:18:36.127 --> 01:18:38.755
Bill? Are you okay?

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:43.593
I just saw Timothy Leary.

01:18:43.718 --> 01:18:45.720
Timothy Leary is dead.

01:18:46.095 --> 01:18:47.388
I know.

01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:50.224
He'd got an idea.

01:18:55.479 --> 01:18:57.064
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:18:57.648 --> 01:18:59.650
Gonna get some ice-cream.

01:19:46.112 --> 01:19:47.697
Don't eat the eggs.

01:19:50.992 --> 01:19:54.120
- What?
- Don't eat the eggs.

01:20:21.897 --> 01:20:23.607
What's going on?

01:20:23.857 --> 01:20:26.276
We put LSD in the eggs.

01:20:28.195 --> 01:20:31.573
Bill showed me where Larry
had some bottles of LSD and...

01:20:31.823 --> 01:20:34.117
We put some in the
powdered eggs last night.

01:20:34.284 --> 01:20:36.119
And in the water.

01:20:37.412 --> 01:20:38.580
What?

01:20:38.664 --> 01:20:41.291
I put it in the main water tank
as well.

01:20:41.458 --> 01:20:43.460
But we drank the water.

01:20:45.003 --> 01:20:46.296
Yeah.

01:21:06.983 --> 01:21:08.568
Right. Hold on.

01:21:09.235 --> 01:21:12.363
The weather today is gonna be...

01:21:12.447 --> 01:21:13.322
...hot.

01:21:13.364 --> 01:21:15.366
I mean, yeah,
I'm guessing that.

01:21:15.575 --> 01:21:17.160
I really didn't looked
at the thing but...

01:21:18.244 --> 01:21:20.997
...I'd say it's gonna be
fucking hot out here!

01:21:21.122 --> 01:21:24.000
Yeah. What else?

01:21:26.752 --> 01:21:30.005
I mean, it's a fucking shocker, right?
It's gonna be hot again.

01:21:33.717 --> 01:21:36.679
It would have been a good idea
if we hadn't drunk the fucking water?

01:21:36.762 --> 01:21:39.723
Well, that might have aroused suspicion.

01:21:39.848 --> 01:21:41.266
But don't worry.
Over the years,

01:21:41.308 --> 01:21:44.853
I've built up a massive tolerance
to all narcotics.

01:22:01.411 --> 01:22:05.498
You're going to hit the gates!
You're going to hit the gates!

01:22:10.128 --> 01:22:12.422
That's cool!
You missed it!

01:22:17.552 --> 01:22:22.056
In the name of the New Earth Army
and loving people everywhere,

01:22:22.599 --> 01:22:24.600
...I'm liberating you!

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:36.404
I'm liberating this base!

01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:49.458
Come on!
Go! Go!

01:22:56.590 --> 01:23:00.469
Come on! Move!
Move on! Come on!

01:23:36.212 --> 01:23:38.339
Put the gun down, Larry.

01:23:44.971 --> 01:23:46.139
No!

01:23:50.935 --> 01:23:53.896
Wow, I'm really hungry.

01:23:58.567 --> 01:24:00.986
- Come on!
- Let's go! Come on!

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.325
Come with me!

01:24:13.665 --> 01:24:15.667
Don't worry about this guards.

01:24:25.802 --> 01:24:27.387
Be free!

01:25:14.850 --> 01:25:16.685
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait for me!

01:25:16.769 --> 01:25:19.730
Where are you going?
What about the mission?

01:25:20.356 --> 01:25:22.775
You are the mission, Bob!

01:25:23.108 --> 01:25:26.987
Tell them what happened.
Tell everybody what happened.

01:25:27.696 --> 01:25:29.698
It's your job now.

01:25:35.370 --> 01:25:38.123
At the time I was hurt that
Lyn hadn't taken me with him.

01:25:38.206 --> 01:25:39.207
But now I know,

01:25:39.249 --> 01:25:42.794
...it was because he and Bill
had already seen what was to come.

01:26:02.647 --> 01:26:04.941
Nobody exactly knows
what happened.

01:26:05.024 --> 01:26:07.569
The official story is that
their helicopter must have crashed,

01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:10.989
...either because they were hit
by an RPG or because...

01:26:11.114 --> 01:26:11.990
Well, that's what happens...

01:26:12.031 --> 01:26:15.284
...when you fly a helicopter
while you're tripping on acid.

01:26:16.577 --> 01:26:19.831
All I know is that
they've never been seen since.

01:26:20.414 --> 01:26:23.542
Like all Shaman,
they returned to the sky.

01:26:27.922 --> 01:26:30.132
When I got back,
I wrote the story up.

01:26:30.216 --> 01:26:31.509
Everything.

01:26:31.675 --> 01:26:34.637
Lyn had handed a mission on
to me and I'd see through it.

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.348
I would tell everyone
what happened.

01:26:37.556 --> 01:26:38.432
I understood now that...

01:26:38.474 --> 01:26:40.309
...Debora and I weren’t
meant to be together and...

01:26:40.392 --> 01:26:42.227
...I was at peace with that.

01:26:42.353 --> 01:26:45.898
It wasn't in my destiny to return
to the life I had before.

01:26:45.981 --> 01:26:48.609
The Universe has other plans for me.

01:26:48.734 --> 01:26:51.570
I sent the story to the newspapers
and TV stations.

01:26:51.737 --> 01:26:53.322
I didn't care what the authorities
did to me.

01:26:53.405 --> 01:26:56.950
I was ready to go to prison
as long as the truth came out.

01:26:57.159 --> 01:26:59.578
But they didn't put me in prison.

01:26:59.786 --> 01:27:01.371
They did something much worse.

01:27:01.455 --> 01:27:04.291
...unusual tool to break
the resistance of Iraqi POWs

01:27:04.374 --> 01:27:07.502
...and trust me,
a lot of parents would agree!

01:27:07.586 --> 01:27:10.463
Some prisoners are being forced
to listen to Barney...

01:27:10.505 --> 01:27:13.717
...the Purple Dinosaur
sing the "I Love You song",

01:27:13.758 --> 01:27:16.594
...for twenty four straight hours.

01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:18.930
And that was it.

01:27:19.806 --> 01:27:23.059
That was the only bit of my story
that ran anywhere.

01:27:23.268 --> 01:27:25.270
And it was a joke.

01:27:26.479 --> 01:27:28.898
And if I ever needed proof
of how the Dark Side have...

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:32.485
...taken the beautiful dream
of what a nation could be...

01:27:32.652 --> 01:27:35.780
...and had twisted it,
destroyed it.

01:27:35.947 --> 01:27:37.532
Well, that was it.

01:27:38.032 --> 01:27:41.577
But I won't stop.
I won't give up.

01:27:42.370 --> 01:27:45.122
Because when I look at what is
happening in the world,

01:27:45.247 --> 01:27:46.832
I know that now,

01:27:46.999 --> 01:27:49.001
more than ever,

01:27:50.211 --> 01:27:52.296
...we need to be
all that we can be.

01:27:52.338 --> 01:27:53.505
Bob?

01:27:54.381 --> 01:27:57.926
Now, more than ever,

01:27:59.386 --> 01:28:01.680
...we need the Jedi.
