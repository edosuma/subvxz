the worst criminal offenders are pursued
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:07.106 --> 00:10.026
These are their stories.

00:12.822 --> 00:14.583
Not this again.

00:14.583 --> 00:15.773
What do you think you're gonna find?

00:15.773 --> 00:18.539
Motel receipts? Love letters?

00:18.539 --> 00:21.539
Lyz, why are you doing this?

00:24.272 --> 00:27.272
Why are you, Henry?

00:28.008 --> 00:31.008
I think she's having me followed.

00:32.274 --> 00:33.995
I don't know what's wrong with her.

00:33.995 --> 00:35.836
Yesterday she left me nine messages,

00:35.836 --> 00:38.836
telling me to be careful.

00:39.654 --> 00:41.149
I gave the cook the night off.

00:41.149 --> 00:43.990
I thought we could all
have dinner at Mr. Chow's.

00:43.990 --> 00:45.753
Uh, sorry, Mom.
I have to work.

00:45.753 --> 00:48.033
I can't make it either.
I have to fly to Miami.

00:48.033 --> 00:50.384
I won't be back till after midnight.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.762
I can do an early lunch,
around 11:00.

00:52.762 --> 00:54.156
I can swing that.

00:54.156 --> 00:55.286
I'm busy.

00:55.286 --> 00:57.125
Never mind.

00:57.125 --> 01:00.125
I just wanted us all to have dinner.

01:04.986 --> 01:05.925
If I were less trusting,

01:05.925 --> 01:08.925
I'd think she's the one having the affair.

01:14.309 --> 01:17.437
I told you I'm gonna prove
how wrong you are, and I will.

01:17.437 --> 01:18.791
Stay out of it, Clayton.

01:18.791 --> 01:20.262
Please?

01:21.313 --> 01:24.313
You and Dad are
not splitting up over this bull.

01:28.941 --> 01:30.906
Big hands, great ass, ponytail...

01:30.906 --> 01:32.176
Oh, what was his name?

01:32.176 --> 01:34.444
Lyz, you remember that
Welsh masseur at Bliss?

01:34.444 --> 01:35.368
No.

01:36.334 --> 01:37.540
It's gonna be a boy.

01:37.540 --> 01:38.769
What?

01:38.769 --> 01:41.697
Oh, you mean Livvy...
my sister-in-law.

01:41.697 --> 01:44.171
We just found out
Monday she's pregnant again.

01:44.171 --> 01:47.256
But how did you know?

01:47.256 --> 01:49.444
Did she go off her Xanax?

01:49.444 --> 01:50.738
Clayton, it's Mom again.

01:50.738 --> 01:52.288
Would you please, please,
give me a call.

01:52.288 --> 01:54.414
I just want to make sure you're okay.

01:54.414 --> 01:57.414
I'll try you at work again.

02:07.217 --> 02:09.414
Clayton?

02:09.414 --> 02:11.690
Oh, I thought...

02:11.690 --> 02:14.133
No, he still hasn't called.

02:14.133 --> 02:16.282
I just have this terrible...

02:18.431 --> 02:23.137
Yes, it would help.
Are you sure?

02:23.137 --> 02:25.488
Thank you.

02:25.488 --> 02:28.255
Yes, I'm... I'm sitting down.

02:28.255 --> 02:32.586
Oh, man, I can't believe
how much that girl drank.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.586
It looks like she helped
this guy park his car.

02:37.052 --> 02:40.184
Hey, wait.
What's that? A little TV?

02:40.184 --> 02:41.435
It's a video monitor.

02:41.435 --> 02:43.014
Somebody left it on.

02:43.014 --> 02:45.467
It's a live transmission from a camera.

02:45.467 --> 02:48.020
It's got to be close.

02:48.020 --> 02:51.585
Trunk's open.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2003/10/12

03:46.195 --> 03:48.672
We called you as soon as
we found his press credentials.

03:48.672 --> 03:51.307
Clayton Webster:
He's a cameraman for Newstime.

03:51.307 --> 03:52.637
His cell phone was in the car.

03:52.637 --> 03:53.992
He's got messages.

03:53.992 --> 03:55.832
We're getting his password
from the phone company.

03:55.832 --> 03:57.943
Thanks.

03:59.478 --> 04:00.927
Wallet's loaded.

04:00.927 --> 04:03.438
Plastic's all accounted for.

04:03.438 --> 04:06.807
Maybe one day we'll get lucky
and robbery will be the motive.

04:08.567 --> 04:12.190
Now, the light doesn't work,
but, uh,

04:13.116 --> 04:15.101
the bulb...

04:16.740 --> 04:18.579
It looks new.

04:21.083 --> 04:24.040
Webster?
Yeah. His throat's been cut.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.431
There's hardly any blood in the trunk.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.660
There's no blood on the ground.

04:27.660 --> 04:29.094
He was killed somewhere else.

04:29.094 --> 04:32.445
Yeah, they put his body
in the trunk, and his camera...

04:32.445 --> 04:35.385
they didn't realize
the camera was still running...

04:35.385 --> 04:37.477
and then drove the car here.

04:37.477 --> 04:39.413
The tape's missing.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.782
Maybe he was working
and pointed his camera at the wrong news.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.441
Of all places to ditch a car,

04:44.441 --> 04:48.532
Long Island City would
not be my first choice.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.142
Morning mass.

04:52.142 --> 04:54.233
St. Peter's.

04:54.233 --> 04:57.301
Webster had a short walk to the pearly gates.

04:57.301 --> 05:01.877
Assuming that's where he was headed.

05:01.877 --> 05:04.491
Newstime Offices 52 East 10th Street
Wednesday, April 30

05:04.491 --> 05:07.001
We were doing a story on a doorman strike,

05:07.001 --> 05:08.700
another on gypsy cabs.

05:08.700 --> 05:09.848
Nothing more dangerous than that.

05:09.848 --> 05:11.852
Maybe he was working on a story of his own.

05:11.852 --> 05:13.758
Uh, no. He was my cameraman.

05:13.758 --> 05:15.518
If we could look at his computer...

05:15.518 --> 05:16.809
It's not his computer.

05:16.809 --> 05:18.020
It's the company's.

05:18.020 --> 05:21.318
There could be names of sources,
all kinds of protected information.

05:21.318 --> 05:23.901
"If your pictures aren't good enough,
you aren't close enough."

05:23.901 --> 05:25.492
The war photographer, Robert Capa.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.287
Webster's motto?

05:27.287 --> 05:28.662
Yeah, I guess.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.931
Is this Webster here?

05:29.931 --> 05:33.790
Look. He was in the war on Iraq.

05:33.790 --> 05:35.775
Was he embedded?

05:35.775 --> 05:38.247
I don't think the kid
actually saw any action.

05:38.247 --> 05:39.603
Eh, just, you know...

05:39.603 --> 05:41.459
I can see he has some messages here

05:41.459 --> 05:43.315
from his mom last night.

05:43.315 --> 05:44.810
Yeah, last night.
Every night.

05:44.810 --> 05:46.142
The kid lived with his parents.

05:46.142 --> 05:47.802
Do you mind if we keep these messages?

05:47.802 --> 05:49.926
I'm sure his mom wasn't, uh,

05:49.926 --> 05:51.136
one of his sources.

05:51.136 --> 05:53.552
And if you find anything on that computer,

05:53.552 --> 05:55.657
you let us know.

06:01.311 --> 06:04.014
- Christine Roberts?
- Uh, she's not here, and I have to go out.

06:04.014 --> 06:05.049
I'm a reporter for the...

06:05.049 --> 06:07.429
You were going so fast,
we almost lost you.

06:07.429 --> 06:10.887
Oh, look, a download off Webster's
computer from the property tax rolls.

06:10.887 --> 06:13.950
Must be for the story
he wasn't doing on his own.

06:13.950 --> 06:15.417
We'll take over from here, Jerry.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.282
Mmm.

06:16.282 --> 06:17.575
Can we come in?

06:17.575 --> 06:20.108
The police. What choice do I have?

06:20.108 --> 06:21.564
I'm Detective Goren.

06:21.564 --> 06:23.028
This is Detective Eames.
Uh...

06:23.028 --> 06:24.627
- And you are?
- Octavia Ruiz.

06:24.627 --> 06:26.079
I rent this place from Christine.

06:26.079 --> 06:27.186
I moved in three weeks ago.

06:27.186 --> 06:28.846
Do you want to see my green card?

06:28.846 --> 06:30.278
It's not necessary.

06:30.278 --> 06:31.624
You are in the art business.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.670
I am a lawyer.

06:33.670 --> 06:37.264
I am representing the estate of
a great collector in Santiago.

06:37.264 --> 06:39.107
I found a buyer in New York.

06:39.107 --> 06:39.954
The Webster Gallery.

06:39.954 --> 06:42.682
These are going to the Webster Gallery?

06:42.682 --> 06:44.379
He is my buyer.

06:44.379 --> 06:45.488
Mr. Henry Webster.

06:45.488 --> 06:50.179
Does he have a brother
or a son named Clayton?

06:50.179 --> 06:51.956
A son, yes.
A funny name like that.

06:51.956 --> 06:53.464
What's funny is Clayton looked up

06:53.464 --> 06:56.464
who was paying the tax on this condo.

06:57.283 --> 06:58.514
Why would he do that?

06:58.514 --> 07:01.272
Maybe he thought his father was paying.

07:01.272 --> 07:05.020
Oh, I see, because Henry
and I are having an affair?

07:05.020 --> 07:06.858
Now that is ridiculous.

07:06.858 --> 07:07.782
Uh, i-is there a reason

07:07.782 --> 07:09.225
why you haven't sent these to him yet?

07:09.225 --> 07:11.238
I mean, the shipping label

07:11.238 --> 07:14.429
still has a date from a month ago.

07:14.429 --> 07:18.301
I'm waiting for Henry to pay me.

07:18.301 --> 07:19.816
How much does he owe you?

07:19.816 --> 07:21.862
Two million dollars.

07:21.862 --> 07:23.253
Well, there you go right there.

07:23.253 --> 07:25.381
Maybe that's why his son is suspicious.

07:25.381 --> 07:26.776
Oh, St. Peter's.

07:26.776 --> 07:29.943
Right across from where
Clayton was found this morning,

07:29.943 --> 07:31.438
dead.

07:33.525 --> 07:36.328
L-I'll bet you're gonna say
it was a coincidence.

07:36.328 --> 07:37.734
- No. L-l...
- No?

07:37.734 --> 07:40.807
- I mean, yes.
- Yes?

07:40.807 --> 07:42.060
I don't understand.

07:42.060 --> 07:46.392
There is nothing between Henry and me.

07:46.392 --> 07:48.144
Nothing.

07:50.848 --> 07:55.625
Two million bucks worth of art is nothing?

07:55.625 --> 07:57.633
The Webster Gallery 130 Spring Street
Wednesday, April 30

07:57.633 --> 07:59.720
I was in Miami most of the day.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.579
I got back just after 1:30.

08:02.579 --> 08:04.075
Clayton was supposed to be working.

08:04.075 --> 08:05.608
I'm... I'm sure the people
in his office would know.

08:05.608 --> 08:09.934
They don't. Do you know where
we found your son, Mr. Webster?

08:09.934 --> 08:14.177
In Long Island City,
in an alley off Steinway Street.

08:14.177 --> 08:16.546
Do you know someone from that neighborhood?

08:16.546 --> 08:19.546
A young woman, Octavia Ruiz?

08:21.038 --> 08:23.974
Uh, yes. Yes, her.
L... I know...

08:23.974 --> 08:25.469
That has nothing to do with Clayton.

08:25.469 --> 08:28.085
Well, we're trying to sort that out.

08:28.085 --> 08:30.241
So far we've come up with two million dollars

08:30.241 --> 08:31.939
that you've given to Ms. Ruiz.

08:31.939 --> 08:33.616
That's coming from your wife, right?

08:33.616 --> 08:35.356
I'm paying for a collection of prints.

08:35.356 --> 08:37.494
As for the source of the money,
that's none of your business.

08:37.494 --> 08:39.359
We checked your wife's pedigree.

08:39.359 --> 08:42.537
It's amazing what one
copper mine can do for a family.

08:42.537 --> 08:44.217
Yes. All right.

08:44.217 --> 08:45.878
Lyz is advancing me the money.

08:45.878 --> 08:46.989
It's a good investment.

08:46.989 --> 08:49.646
It'll put the gallery on the map.

08:49.646 --> 08:51.100
Yeah, but she's having second thoughts,

08:51.100 --> 08:52.762
because she thinks that
there's something going on

08:52.762 --> 08:55.152
between you and Ms. Ruiz.

08:55.152 --> 08:57.850
My wife is very insecure.

08:57.850 --> 09:00.628
What does it have to do with my son?

09:00.628 --> 09:02.815
Well, she tried to get in
touch with your son last night.

09:02.815 --> 09:04.353
She left messages.

09:04.353 --> 09:05.622
That's just Lyz worrying.

09:05.622 --> 09:06.955
She didn't like him working nights.

09:06.955 --> 09:08.178
Maybe she had reason to worry.

09:08.178 --> 09:09.821
Maybe she asked him to confirm

09:09.821 --> 09:13.047
her suspicions, to follow Ms. Ruiz.

09:13.047 --> 09:14.676
In the first place,
there is nothing to confirm.

09:14.676 --> 09:16.336
In the second place, my son

09:16.336 --> 09:18.463
would never humor my wife's paranoid fugues!

09:18.463 --> 09:20.670
This time he did.

09:20.670 --> 09:23.414
He checked the tax records on Ms. Ruiz's condo

09:23.414 --> 09:25.033
to see who the owner was.

09:25.033 --> 09:28.033
Maybe he thought it was you.

09:32.681 --> 09:36.703
My son was not killed because of this.

09:36.703 --> 09:38.971
I don't believe it.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.123
I almost told Henry everything.

09:44.123 --> 09:48.133
L... l... I can't. I know.

09:48.133 --> 09:49.258
It's a terrible burden.

09:49.258 --> 09:50.981
I don't... I don't know how you live with it.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.697
You have to believe that there is a purpose,

09:53.697 --> 09:55.274
that it's a blessing.

09:55.274 --> 09:58.806
And... And know that Clayton will be all right.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.199
He... He died near the three churches.

10:01.199 --> 10:02.673
Three churches.

10:02.673 --> 10:04.250
It's a sign.

10:04.250 --> 10:07.591
Surrounded by angels and saints.

10:07.591 --> 10:09.067
He's at peace.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.838
And he wants you to know that.

10:16.853 --> 10:19.555
The airline confirmed the dad
was on the flight back from Miami.

10:19.555 --> 10:24.139
Ms. Ruiz, on the other hand,
was at a gallery opening downtown.

10:24.139 --> 10:27.203
A neighbor saw her come home
alone around 11:00.

10:27.203 --> 10:28.798
Ruiz had anything to do with this murder,

10:28.798 --> 10:29.998
you think she'd make sure the body

10:29.998 --> 10:31.639
didn't end up on her doorstep.

10:31.639 --> 10:33.867
Yeah, that's not the only thing
that doesn't add up.

10:33.867 --> 10:37.318
Uh, the lab found traces of animal blood...

10:37.318 --> 10:38.550
in the wound on the kid's neck,

10:38.550 --> 10:39.802
probably from the knife.

10:39.802 --> 10:43.639
And then there's the bulb in the trunk.

10:43.639 --> 10:46.202
The repair record on the car...

10:46.202 --> 10:50.716
shows it was replaced six months ago.

10:50.716 --> 10:53.370
They last longer than that.

10:53.370 --> 10:57.111
Well, unless it stays on all night.

10:57.111 --> 10:58.679
It's the pass code

10:58.679 --> 11:01.679
for the voice mail on Clayton's cell phone.

11:03.721 --> 11:05.033
First message.

11:05.033 --> 11:06.570
Where are you, sweetheart?

11:06.570 --> 11:08.290
I wish you'd call me.

11:08.290 --> 11:09.706
Next message.

11:09.706 --> 11:10.892
Clayton, it's Mom again.

11:10.892 --> 11:12.515
Would you please, please, give me a call.

11:12.515 --> 11:14.332
I just want to make sure you're okay.

11:14.332 --> 11:16.072
End of messages.

11:16.072 --> 11:19.552
That was at 11:35.

11:19.552 --> 11:20.598
Just about the same time

11:20.598 --> 11:23.766
as the last message she left at his work.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.161
This lady's sick with worry,

11:25.161 --> 11:28.161
and she just stopped calling?

11:28.385 --> 11:29.435
I went to bed.

11:29.435 --> 11:31.297
That's why I stopped.

11:31.297 --> 11:34.622
Please be careful.

11:34.622 --> 11:37.735
We will.

11:37.735 --> 11:41.977
Is there a particular reason
why you were calling him?

11:41.977 --> 11:44.258
We were very close.
We talked often.

11:44.258 --> 11:47.425
Uh, about your husband.

11:47.425 --> 11:51.254
Your husband told us
you suspect him of having an affair.

11:54.524 --> 11:58.634
Did you ask your son to check up
on a woman, Octavia Ruiz,

11:58.634 --> 12:01.922
maybe watch her apartment,

12:01.922 --> 12:03.967
catch your husband there?

12:03.967 --> 12:06.013
No. I would never ask him to go up there.

12:06.013 --> 12:09.013
It's too dangerous.

12:09.292 --> 12:11.467
Um, up there?

12:11.467 --> 12:12.239
The Bronx.

12:12.239 --> 12:16.348
I found a woman's address
in my husband's wallet.

12:16.348 --> 12:20.539
Mrs. Webster,
she moved three weeks ago,

12:20.539 --> 12:22.733
to Long Island City,

12:22.733 --> 12:25.733
near where we found your son.

12:31.947 --> 12:35.274
I'm sorry.
I'm very upset.

12:35.274 --> 12:38.274
You'll have to come back.

12:41.499 --> 12:44.499
You have a night-light.

12:46.681 --> 12:50.015
You had this a long time,
since Clayton was little?

12:50.015 --> 12:53.674
Yes. He was afraid of the dark,

12:53.674 --> 12:57.819
and he just got used to having it on.

12:57.819 --> 13:03.157
Yes. You didn't want him
lying alone in the dark.

13:09.309 --> 13:11.847
She's the one...

13:11.847 --> 13:14.729
who opened the trunk to leave the light on.

13:14.729 --> 13:18.350
She found the body.

13:18.350 --> 13:20.782
Even though she didn't know
Ruiz lived down the street.

13:20.782 --> 13:23.731
Yeah. She couldn't know that.

13:23.731 --> 13:28.440
But somehow she knew where to look for her son.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.059
Her only outgoing calls were to her

13:32.059 --> 13:34.349
son's cell phone and to his work.

13:34.349 --> 13:36.068
She got a call from a no-name,

13:36.068 --> 13:37.622
pay-as-you-go cell phone...

13:37.622 --> 13:38.608
A 20-minute call,

13:38.608 --> 13:41.046
maybe to tell her where her son was.

13:41.046 --> 13:42.335
A mother finds her son dead,

13:42.335 --> 13:44.175
she calls 911, she tells her husband.

13:44.175 --> 13:46.855
She doesn't just go home
and wait for all hell to break loose.

13:46.855 --> 13:48.756
Yeah, well, she somehow feels responsible.

13:48.756 --> 13:50.763
Because of her suspicions, her worries.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.681
Yeah. I'm starting to think...

13:53.681 --> 13:57.784
that this death was staged for her benefit.

13:57.784 --> 13:59.088
To make her believe that

13:59.088 --> 14:02.193
it had something to do with
an alleged affair.

14:02.193 --> 14:03.937
You find the perps,
you can always ask them.

14:03.937 --> 14:06.820
Well, luckily,
they left a calling card.

14:06.820 --> 14:09.984
The lab identified the animal
blood on the knife...

14:09.984 --> 14:14.009
being mixed chicken,
sheep and goat blood.

14:14.009 --> 14:16.712
And this.

14:16.712 --> 14:18.273
This is where the car was abandoned.

14:18.273 --> 14:19.807
On the northeast corner...

14:19.807 --> 14:23.054
of a square being framed by St. Peter's Church,

14:23.054 --> 14:25.671
St. Anthony's and St. Francis.

14:25.671 --> 14:30.881
Now these are three saints
that correspond with orisha...

14:30.881 --> 14:36.295
spirits worshipped by people
who practice Santeria.

14:36.295 --> 14:38.301
Some Santeria followers,

14:38.301 --> 14:40.124
they believe that this square...

14:40.124 --> 14:42.311
has mystical properties.

14:42.311 --> 14:45.721
The killers might've thought
placing the body there...

14:45.721 --> 14:48.632
would protect them.

14:48.632 --> 14:51.532
You think Santeria,
you think South America.

14:51.532 --> 14:53.480
We think cutthroat art business.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.255
You're on the verge of an important deal.

14:55.255 --> 14:56.976
Somebody wants to stop it.

14:56.976 --> 15:00.243
And since Ms. Ruiz wouldn't
torpedo her own deal...

15:00.243 --> 15:02.351
That leaves someone
connected to you or your wife.

15:02.351 --> 15:04.944
Someone that knows about
your wife's insecurities.

15:04.944 --> 15:07.744
Well, that could be any of my friends.

15:07.744 --> 15:09.704
She's got these moods where she thinks that

15:09.704 --> 15:13.133
money is the only reason
that anybody cares about her.

15:13.133 --> 15:15.485
That's why this was so important,

15:15.485 --> 15:17.469
why I needed this t-t-to work,

15:17.469 --> 15:19.046
to be a success.

15:19.046 --> 15:21.072
'Cause once you're financially independent,

15:21.072 --> 15:23.707
she would know that you love her for herself.

15:23.707 --> 15:26.688
But it's only driven us further apart.

15:26.688 --> 15:29.330
Well, maybe that's the point...
to drive you apart.

15:29.330 --> 15:32.698
Well, now you got me thinking
that I should've had her followed.

15:32.698 --> 15:33.969
Why?

15:33.969 --> 15:37.318
Did she have you followed?

15:37.318 --> 15:40.038
When I borrowed Clayton's car
one night two weeks ago,

15:40.038 --> 15:43.791
I thought Lyz was having me followed.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.675
I noticed them right after
I picked up the car.

15:45.675 --> 15:48.652
Two Hispanic men in a gray car. Um,

15:48.652 --> 15:50.698
I let them pull up next to me at a light.

15:50.698 --> 15:53.698
When they saw me looking at them, they...

15:54.554 --> 15:55.951
they were surprised.

15:55.951 --> 15:58.431
And they took off.

15:58.431 --> 16:00.370
Where'd you pick up your son's car?

16:00.370 --> 16:03.194
At the parking garage at his work.

16:03.194 --> 16:05.734
Parking Garage 63 East 68th Street
Monday, May 5

16:05.734 --> 16:07.149
They parked over there.

16:07.149 --> 16:09.376
You remember their license?

16:09.376 --> 16:10.953
Uh...

16:10.953 --> 16:13.086
No, l... I don't remember.

16:13.086 --> 16:15.046
Did they smoke?

16:15.046 --> 16:17.275
Yeah. The tall one did.

16:17.275 --> 16:19.083
Back here?

16:19.083 --> 16:23.007
Yeah, the short one wouldn't let him,
uh, smoke in the car.

16:23.007 --> 16:25.053
Thanks.

16:27.505 --> 16:29.449
This print here...

16:31.881 --> 16:35.651
Yeah. It repeats itself.

16:35.651 --> 16:39.287
It's always parallel to the column.

16:39.287 --> 16:43.242
And it always has more compression on the instep.

16:43.242 --> 16:47.659
He was leaning against the column.

16:47.659 --> 16:51.525
So, the guy stood on his left foot,

16:51.525 --> 16:53.632
crossed his right foot over his left,

16:53.632 --> 16:56.390
held a cigarette in his left hand...

16:56.390 --> 16:59.680
and leaned towards the column.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.008
Held onto the column with his right hand...

17:02.008 --> 17:05.569
right about here.

17:05.569 --> 17:07.364
Maybe the orishas will be good

17:07.364 --> 17:11.198
to us and give us a set of prints.

17:13.728 --> 17:16.749
The threat is gone.

17:16.749 --> 17:19.262
You're safe, Eduardo.

17:19.262 --> 17:21.799
But remember the promise you made.

17:21.799 --> 17:25.157
Their protection is not guaranteed for life.

17:25.157 --> 17:27.486
You have to keep earning it.

17:27.486 --> 17:29.950
I know.

17:36.909 --> 17:39.321
If your men fail,

17:39.321 --> 17:41.653
if they talk, Eduardo,

17:41.653 --> 17:45.641
the orishas will be very angry.

17:52.916 --> 17:54.676
They're bringing in
one of the guys from the garage,

17:54.676 --> 17:59.468
Nestor Reyes. The other one,
Omar Sanchez, is still missing.

17:59.468 --> 18:00.859
What's that?

18:00.859 --> 18:02.031
Looks like a little crutch.

18:02.031 --> 18:03.833
It's for St. Lazarus.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.352
The followers of Santeria,
they wear it for protection...

18:06.352 --> 18:09.712
against disease or death.

18:09.712 --> 18:12.712
What're you gonna do with it?

18:16.594 --> 18:19.086
I don't know this guy.

18:19.086 --> 18:20.927
What about your cousin Omar?

18:20.927 --> 18:22.588
I don't got a cousin Omar.

18:22.588 --> 18:23.674
Little Omar?

18:23.674 --> 18:25.130
The one we found in your jacket,

18:25.130 --> 18:27.673
under "known associates."

18:27.673 --> 18:30.673
He told us he knows you.

18:31.876 --> 18:34.202
You don't got Little Omar.

18:34.202 --> 18:35.426
He told us why you parked the car

18:35.426 --> 18:37.655
next to the three churches.

18:37.655 --> 18:40.293
To be protected, right, Nestor?

18:40.293 --> 18:42.054
Somebody's telling you stories.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.301
That's Santeria stuff... that's crap.

18:44.301 --> 18:47.179
Little Omar doesn't think so.

18:47.179 --> 18:48.456
You should've seen him when we showed him...

18:48.456 --> 18:52.100
what the guy you killed had in his pocket.

18:56.628 --> 18:59.404
There's no way you could
kill him and get away with it.

18:59.404 --> 19:02.306
Not with St. Lazarus watching over him.

19:02.306 --> 19:04.953
Oh, man. Oh, man.

19:04.953 --> 19:07.021
We're dead men!

19:07.021 --> 19:09.859
Not if you confess.

19:09.859 --> 19:12.604
This killing wasn't your idea, was it?

19:15.734 --> 19:18.141
The person who gave you the order...

19:18.141 --> 19:21.226
that guy is gonna have to answer to orisha.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.509
Not you.

19:27.432 --> 19:30.527
Okay. I tell you.

19:30.527 --> 19:32.285
It's Eduardo Mendez.

19:32.285 --> 19:34.289
Omar visited him up in Rikers.

19:34.289 --> 19:35.655
He told Omar what to do

19:35.655 --> 19:38.992
and to leave the body next to the three churches.

19:41.470 --> 19:43.478
Far as I can tell, Mr. Carver,

19:43.478 --> 19:45.794
the only card you're holding is the uncooperated

19:45.794 --> 19:49.628
hearsay testimony of an admitted killer.

19:49.628 --> 19:52.971
I wouldn't wait for us
to cooperate it before making a deal.

19:52.971 --> 19:56.910
Mr. Mendez is already
facing drug and murder charges.

19:56.910 --> 19:59.654
I never talked to a Nestor.

19:59.654 --> 20:00.972
And Omar...

20:00.972 --> 20:04.322
nobody seems to worry about Omar anymore.

20:04.322 --> 20:07.322
Because you had him killed.

20:08.568 --> 20:10.593
Things take care of themselves.

20:10.593 --> 20:13.727
Yeah, well, the orisha doesn't
seem to be taking care of you anymore.

20:13.727 --> 20:19.174
I mean, otherwise we wouldn't be here
putting another murder on you.

20:19.174 --> 20:22.324
You killed someone under their protection.

20:22.324 --> 20:26.120
Nestor and Omar didn't take the time to

20:26.120 --> 20:31.694
look through Clayton Webster's
pockets before they cut his throat.

20:31.694 --> 20:34.543
You're in prison.

20:34.543 --> 20:39.919
You're... You're looking down at a life sentence.

20:39.919 --> 20:42.430
But you're not afraid.

20:42.430 --> 20:46.800
And you feel safe from the laws of this world...

20:46.800 --> 20:50.581
and the next.

20:50.581 --> 20:54.910
There's someone watching over you, isn't there?

21:02.497 --> 21:06.303
You sure there's no connection with Clayton Webster?

21:06.303 --> 21:07.999
None.

21:09.380 --> 21:11.920
Then Mendez just picked

21:11.920 --> 21:13.292
Webster's name out of a hat?

21:13.292 --> 21:16.273
Or someone picked him for him.

21:16.273 --> 21:17.559
Someone that could convince him that

21:17.559 --> 21:22.342
Clayton Webster was a threat to him.

21:22.342 --> 21:25.415
And who would that be?

21:25.415 --> 21:27.967
Someone who could guarantee his safety,

21:27.967 --> 21:30.166
who has the authority in this

21:30.166 --> 21:34.014
other world that he believes in.

21:35.958 --> 21:38.153
His priest.

21:38.153 --> 21:41.157
His Santeria priest.

21:43.355 --> 21:45.164
I signed the visitors sheet at the prison...

21:45.164 --> 21:48.736
with the understanding that Mr. Mendez's
religious beliefs wouldn't be scrutinized.

21:48.736 --> 21:51.904
Actually, it's you we're scrutinizing, Mr. Bello.

21:51.904 --> 21:55.853
So far, we've found out
you did time in Texas for fraud...

21:55.853 --> 21:58.269
in association with revival meetings.

21:58.269 --> 22:00.369
That was when you were under your legal name,

22:00.369 --> 22:01.866
Julian Bellonte.

22:01.866 --> 22:04.525
So you went from Bible thumping to Santeria.

22:04.525 --> 22:08.383
I came to Santeria a long time ago,
through an aunt.

22:08.383 --> 22:11.774
But I had to find my own path
before I could embrace it.

22:11.774 --> 22:14.308
Oh, so you're on a spiritual quest.

22:14.308 --> 22:16.017
I'm more interested in your quest.

22:16.017 --> 22:19.678
It has to do with the guidance
you give Eduardo Mendez.

22:19.678 --> 22:22.049
It's advice of a religious nature.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.282
Morning sickness.
Still getting used to it.

22:24.282 --> 22:26.098
Santeria has commandments, huh?

22:26.098 --> 22:29.098
Don't kill. Don't steal.

22:29.098 --> 22:32.303
I guess Eduardo was a recent convert.

22:32.303 --> 22:34.124
Now that he has more time on his hands,

22:34.124 --> 22:37.961
he's paying more attention to his soul.

22:37.961 --> 22:40.352
These colors are for Elegba,

22:40.352 --> 22:42.294
St. Anthony.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.291
Do you know a Clayton Webster,

22:44.291 --> 22:46.140
the news cameraman?

22:46.140 --> 22:48.265
I try to stay away from newspeople.

22:48.265 --> 22:51.249
Well, don't worry.
Eduardo had him killed last week.

22:51.249 --> 22:53.417
And this is an Ogun,
St. Peter.

22:53.417 --> 22:55.663
Eduardo doesn't discuss his business with me.

22:55.663 --> 22:58.218
Clayton Webster's throat was cut.

22:58.218 --> 23:00.568
Knife left traces of animal blood.

23:00.568 --> 23:04.681
His body was found under
the shadow of three churches.

23:04.681 --> 23:06.501
The murder had ritualistic touches,

23:06.501 --> 23:08.199
Santeria touches.

23:08.199 --> 23:09.938
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

23:09.938 --> 23:11.918
W-W-We're sorry that we've stressed you out.

23:11.918 --> 23:15.238
- You know, your neck...
- It was a fender bender last year.

23:15.238 --> 23:16.142
that's all.

23:16.142 --> 23:19.142
Someone rear-ended me.

23:19.446 --> 23:24.510
Well, i-it's funny you didn't see him comin'.

23:28.649 --> 23:30.719
Julian Bello has a hack license.

23:30.719 --> 23:33.186
He got his accident driving for a limo company.

23:33.186 --> 23:35.761
They house their cars in Long Island City.

23:35.761 --> 23:37.501
That would explain why
he's familiar with the neighborhood.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.642
Might explain a lot if he drove the Websters.

23:39.642 --> 23:42.642
I'm not finding them on Bello's receipts.

23:44.152 --> 23:46.644
Even if he was their chauffeur,

23:46.644 --> 23:48.833
you see them getting mixed up with Bello's hoodoo?

23:48.833 --> 23:50.612
Oh, we're just observing phenomena,

23:50.612 --> 23:53.968
not explaining it.

23:53.968 --> 23:55.522
Here we go.

23:55.522 --> 24:02.079
Bello made a drop-off at the Websters' last year.

24:02.079 --> 24:06.405
Passenger's an Ilene Maxwell.

24:06.405 --> 24:13.081
Well, looks like Bello was
Ms. Maxwell's regular driver until...

24:13.081 --> 24:16.264
Looks like four months ago.

24:16.264 --> 24:17.922
Apartment of Ilene Maxwell
1094 Fifth Avenue, Tuesday, May 6

24:17.922 --> 24:20.844
He never talked to me about animal sacrifices.

24:20.844 --> 24:22.663
My God, I don't even wear fur.

24:22.663 --> 24:24.688
Did Lyz Webster ever meet him?

24:24.688 --> 24:26.960
No. Lyz has her own adviser.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.273
Very reliable person.

24:28.273 --> 24:30.023
Very in tune with people like us.

24:30.023 --> 24:32.321
She's a psychic.
She advises you too?

24:32.321 --> 24:33.959
I don't use Sylvia anymore.

24:33.959 --> 24:35.922
I have an astrologer now.

24:35.922 --> 24:37.644
When did you meet Sylvia?

24:37.644 --> 24:41.066
My son was in the hospital last year,
having his tonsils out.

24:41.066 --> 24:43.334
And the clotting factor in his blood makes even

24:43.334 --> 24:45.403
minor surgery life-threatening.

24:45.403 --> 24:47.559
- You must have been very worried.
- Yes.

24:47.559 --> 24:49.813
I was across the street from
the hospital having lunch,

24:49.813 --> 24:51.207
and a woman came up to me,

24:51.207 --> 24:54.578
introduced herself...
and said my son was going to be fine.

24:54.578 --> 24:56.930
That was Sylvia,
and she was right.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.262
And this was when Julian was driving you...

24:58.262 --> 25:01.462
- to the hospital and back.
- Yes.

25:01.462 --> 25:03.443
And you were probably on the phone

25:03.443 --> 25:05.344
talking about your son's condition, and...

25:05.344 --> 25:08.572
Yes, I imagine I was.

25:08.572 --> 25:11.572
Oh, you're not suggesting that...

25:14.364 --> 25:17.366
I have a strong feeling about this, Susan.

25:17.366 --> 25:20.130
It's very...

25:20.130 --> 25:22.360
Sylvia? Are you there?

25:22.360 --> 25:23.876
Susan, Sylvia will have to call you back.

25:23.876 --> 25:25.695
No, no. It's not your fault.

25:25.695 --> 25:27.481
She'll call you in a few minutes.

25:27.481 --> 25:30.769
Okay. Bye-bye.

25:30.769 --> 25:32.268
What did you see?

25:32.268 --> 25:35.330
Two people, a... a couple.

25:35.330 --> 25:38.198
The sky was red.
I smelled sulfur.

25:38.198 --> 25:42.209
Okay.
Sulfur... Red sky...

25:42.209 --> 25:45.548
That's lava. A volcano.

25:45.548 --> 25:49.320
You saw us in the South Seas.

25:49.320 --> 25:52.540
W-We have to leave now, Julian.

25:52.540 --> 25:55.374
Lyz can't handle it.
I have to take it away from her,

25:55.374 --> 25:56.450
and then we have to leave.

25:56.450 --> 25:59.517
Hey, she'll grow into it.

25:59.517 --> 26:02.048
Remember how long it took you?

26:02.048 --> 26:04.952
Now she got what you promised her.

26:04.952 --> 26:08.337
And as soon as she fulfills her promise to you,

26:08.337 --> 26:10.809
then we can leave.

26:12.962 --> 26:17.332
My relationship with Sylvia
doesn't concern anyone but me.

26:17.332 --> 26:19.747
Didn't she convince you
your husband was having an affair?

26:19.747 --> 26:21.114
Is that what Henry told you?

26:21.114 --> 26:23.225
Ms. Webster, this woman is feeding off your fears.

26:23.225 --> 26:25.110
It's how she makes a living.

26:25.110 --> 26:26.256
You don't understand.

26:26.256 --> 26:30.224
Sylvia has an accomplice with ties to a drug gang.

26:30.224 --> 26:31.974
He had your son killed.

26:31.974 --> 26:33.688
Julian?

26:33.688 --> 26:34.961
I don't believe that.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.617
Didn't Sylvia call you the night that Clayton died?

26:37.617 --> 26:38.806
No.

26:38.806 --> 26:40.465
We know you got a call.

26:40.465 --> 26:42.801
We know you found the body.

26:42.801 --> 26:44.437
We know you left the trunk open,

26:44.437 --> 26:47.714
so he wouldn't lay in the dark all night.

26:47.714 --> 26:48.982
Now didn't she call you and tell you...

26:48.982 --> 26:54.229
that she had a vision of
where you could find his body?

26:54.229 --> 26:57.267
Nobody told me.

26:59.643 --> 27:01.445
It was you?

27:01.445 --> 27:04.445
It was your vision.

27:06.056 --> 27:09.525
I've been given a very powerful gift.

27:09.525 --> 27:13.733
I don't talk about it
with skeptics and nonbelievers.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.996
Now please leave.

27:24.273 --> 27:25.912
I can't believe this.

27:25.912 --> 27:28.912
Why not?
A premonition about her family came true.

27:28.977 --> 27:30.474
Her son was killed.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.822
Her husband's alleged mistress was implicated.

27:33.822 --> 27:35.483
All thanks to Julian.

27:35.483 --> 27:37.323
He convinced Eduardo

27:37.323 --> 27:38.524
that Clayton was a threat to him.

27:38.524 --> 27:41.098
He told him to leave the body
near the three churches for protection.

27:41.098 --> 27:44.920
But his main agenda was to convince Lyz Webster

27:44.920 --> 27:46.379
she really was psychic.

27:46.379 --> 27:48.320
That she would even believe in psychic powers,

27:48.320 --> 27:52.317
let alone pay someone
to turn her into a clairvoyant

27:52.317 --> 27:54.587
People look for an edge in an uncertain world.

27:54.587 --> 27:56.493
Even people like Lyz Webster.
Hmm.

27:56.493 --> 27:59.455
And people like Sylvia Campbell
and Julian Bello are waiting for them.

27:59.455 --> 28:00.401
They're pros.

28:00.401 --> 28:03.115
Their first appearance as
a duet was 14 years ago.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.067
They were arrested for fraud in connection

28:05.067 --> 28:07.071
with a church they ran in San Francisco.

28:07.071 --> 28:09.583
"The Church of the Open Mind."

28:09.583 --> 28:11.098
Julian served six months.

28:11.098 --> 28:12.392
Sylvia got probation.

28:12.392 --> 28:14.314
They were arrested on another fraud charge.

28:14.314 --> 28:16.379
He got jail. She got probation.

28:16.379 --> 28:18.570
In New Orleans,
they opened a voodoo store...

28:18.570 --> 28:20.174
where they promised to cast demons

28:20.174 --> 28:23.726
out of a Mrs. Thelma Busfield for 20 grand.

28:23.726 --> 28:26.415
Julian got a year,
and again Sylvia got probation.

28:26.415 --> 28:28.767
He takes a plea,
so she can take a walk.

28:28.767 --> 28:33.284
Mr. Bello seems to be the one
to do the heavy lifting in the relationship.

28:33.284 --> 28:36.743
I would love to see the two of them in action.

28:36.743 --> 28:38.863
Apartment Of Julian Bello And Sylvia Campbell
557 West 49th Street, Thursday, May 8

28:38.863 --> 28:40.889
She was his mother.

28:40.889 --> 28:44.150
He was her son.
Of course she found him.

28:44.150 --> 28:45.604
We thought you might have helped her.

28:45.604 --> 28:48.551
The police department uses psychics
all the time to find people.

28:48.551 --> 28:50.637
Oh, l... I don't do work like that.

28:50.637 --> 28:53.637
L-l-It's too disturbing.

28:55.028 --> 28:57.601
Well, if you had a vision of her son's death,

28:57.601 --> 29:00.236
you wouldn't tell Lyz?

29:00.236 --> 29:03.667
Lyz knew there was a shadow on Clayton,

29:03.667 --> 29:06.138
but she didn't know what it was.

29:06.138 --> 29:11.956
Well, did you make her aware of this shadow, or

29:11.956 --> 29:14.184
did she sense it herself?

29:14.184 --> 29:15.577
Well, maybe it's the same shadow

29:15.577 --> 29:18.387
that's been following you since Texas.

29:18.387 --> 29:19.578
Speak of the devil.

29:19.578 --> 29:21.310
The doorman told me you were here.

29:21.310 --> 29:25.001
They're asking about Lyz Webster and her son.

29:25.001 --> 29:27.109
Yeah. And we were about to tell Sylvia...

29:27.109 --> 29:30.109
about the connection to one of your Santeria clients,

29:30.212 --> 29:31.489
Eduardo Mendez.

29:31.489 --> 29:34.078
It so happens, he ordered the hit on Clayton.

29:34.078 --> 29:36.347
Julian, what are they saying?

29:36.347 --> 29:38.046
It's the one I visit in prison.

29:38.046 --> 29:41.428
They're harassing everyone who...

29:45.352 --> 29:46.877
What is it?

29:46.877 --> 29:48.730
Sylvia, I'm here.

29:48.730 --> 29:50.020
Is she okay?

29:50.020 --> 29:51.438
She's fine.

29:51.438 --> 29:53.585
What is it?

29:53.585 --> 29:55.386
I saw water...

29:55.386 --> 29:56.725
rushing water.

29:56.725 --> 29:59.290
A life sign.

29:59.290 --> 30:03.320
- What else?
- I smelled fresh earth.

30:03.320 --> 30:06.218
It's new life.

30:07.467 --> 30:10.467
Do you feel new life in this room?

30:12.144 --> 30:14.938
Oh, are you having a baby?

30:14.938 --> 30:17.331
Yes. How about that?

30:17.331 --> 30:20.579
You'll have a brave child.

30:20.579 --> 30:22.459
Her clairvoyance...

30:22.459 --> 30:26.301
It's not just sights.
She can also smell things.

30:26.301 --> 30:30.114
Yes. And the next time
you want to drop in, call ahead.

30:30.114 --> 30:31.682
I'll have a lawyer waiting.

30:31.682 --> 30:34.195
Come on. Let's go.

30:35.837 --> 30:37.715
That's a neat trick.

30:37.715 --> 30:41.002
He knew I was pregnant from the store.

30:41.002 --> 30:42.669
If she had said "crab cakes,"

30:42.669 --> 30:45.958
he would've said "crawling babies."

30:45.958 --> 30:48.407
Well, maybe it is a trick.

30:48.407 --> 30:51.407
Maybe the trick's on her.

30:53.468 --> 30:56.387
This can't be the Sylvia I know.

30:56.387 --> 30:57.943
Ms. Webster,

30:57.943 --> 31:00.943
I think that Sylvia believes that
she's clairvoyant,

31:01.827 --> 31:05.139
just as she believes that she can
heal with crystals and potions and faith.

31:05.139 --> 31:07.472
And she's sincere in her beliefs.

31:07.472 --> 31:11.734
And that she absolutely believes that
she can share this gift with you.

31:11.734 --> 31:15.395
She said she'd... she'd help me
develop my natural powers,

31:15.395 --> 31:17.217
like Julian had helped her.

31:17.217 --> 31:19.362
She expected you to pay for this gift?

31:19.362 --> 31:21.287
Julian did.

31:21.287 --> 31:24.470
There was a consideration every month... $20,000.

31:24.470 --> 31:27.848
And a larger sum later.

31:27.848 --> 31:29.861
When you had proof you were clairvoyant.

31:29.861 --> 31:34.993
Yes.
$500,000.

31:34.993 --> 31:37.873
But it went longer than you anticipated...

31:37.873 --> 31:39.935
because you had doubts.

31:39.935 --> 31:43.579
And because Clayton...

31:43.579 --> 31:46.275
was pressing you to stop seeing Sylvia.

31:46.275 --> 31:48.829
He thought I was being exploited.

31:48.829 --> 31:50.895
You told Sylvia and Julian?

31:50.895 --> 31:54.819
Yes. Julian said I should be more patient.

31:54.819 --> 31:57.819
And then you'd have the proof.

32:00.188 --> 32:05.068
The night that...
that Clayton died,

32:05.702 --> 32:06.973
I know it...

32:06.973 --> 32:09.831
it wasn't Sylvia who called you.

32:09.831 --> 32:12.831
But it was Julian.

32:14.116 --> 32:19.306
He said Sylvia had told him
to lead me in a guided meditation...

32:19.306 --> 32:21.472
to try and find Clayton.

32:21.472 --> 32:25.248
He interpreted what you saw...

32:25.248 --> 32:27.760
until you were convinced.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.503
No, no, no. If... If it's all pretend,

32:29.503 --> 32:31.628
how did Sylvia know about the three churches?

32:31.628 --> 32:32.923
When did she know?

32:32.923 --> 32:34.795
The next day.

32:34.795 --> 32:37.795
She had to have seen it in a vision.

32:39.852 --> 32:42.852
Or Julian told her.

32:50.023 --> 32:53.166
Oh, God.

32:53.166 --> 32:57.204
Oh, God.
Clayton... it's all my fault.

33:00.536 --> 33:04.301
They caught you when you were vulnerable.

33:04.301 --> 33:07.301
Now they're vulnerable.

33:09.584 --> 33:12.955
Help us catch them.

33:17.209 --> 33:18.519
I'm so glad you called me.

33:18.519 --> 33:21.519
L... I was sending good thoughts to you.

33:21.707 --> 33:23.486
I see things clearly now, Sylvia.

33:23.486 --> 33:25.350
Like photographs.

33:25.350 --> 33:27.393
Just like you said.

33:27.393 --> 33:30.644
I, uh, I made a promise to you.

33:30.644 --> 33:33.644
And a promise is a promise.

33:36.257 --> 33:39.744
It's too much, Lyz.
L... I can't.

33:39.744 --> 33:43.843
No, no.
L... I want you to have it.

33:45.407 --> 33:48.407
Are you all right?

33:50.180 --> 33:52.042
This morning, when I wrote your name on the check,

33:52.042 --> 33:54.432
I saw something...

33:54.432 --> 33:57.432
You and Julian in a room with gray stones.

33:57.658 --> 33:59.969
There was a... a sheet of water,

33:59.969 --> 34:06.033
a mirror and a man with a broken neck.

34:06.033 --> 34:09.750
He was asking a question about three churches.

34:09.750 --> 34:11.629
And the answer was wrong.

34:11.629 --> 34:14.121
It was a lie.

34:14.121 --> 34:17.085
The floor fell away.

34:17.085 --> 34:23.143
I saw you and Julian falling,
both of you falling through space.

34:25.032 --> 34:27.636
Please, Sylvia, be careful.
Please.

34:27.636 --> 34:30.808
Oh, no, no. Thank you.

34:30.808 --> 34:33.808
Thank you.

34:35.545 --> 34:39.329
All here.
Next stop, airport. Huh?

34:39.329 --> 34:40.985
Next stop, downtown.

34:40.985 --> 34:42.540
I bet you know this one by heart:

34:42.540 --> 34:45.096
"Julian Bellonte and Sylvia Campbell,

34:45.096 --> 34:49.335
- you're under arrest for fraud."
- Julian.

34:51.902 --> 34:54.132
You'll sit here.

34:54.132 --> 34:56.848
And if you need something to drink,

34:56.848 --> 34:59.848
you just ask the officer.

35:20.618 --> 35:25.337
Let's put you, uh...
Let's see, right here.

35:27.708 --> 35:29.898
Everybody comfy?

35:29.898 --> 35:31.169
In case you're wondering,

35:31.169 --> 35:34.004
when you exchanged Lyz's check
for the cashier check,

35:34.004 --> 35:38.046
the bank notified Mr. Webster
because of the amount,

35:38.046 --> 35:40.720
and he called us.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.850
And here we all are.

35:42.850 --> 35:46.555
That's a big number.
Why'd she give you this money?

35:46.555 --> 35:50.293
It was a token of appreciation
for Sylvia's guidance and advice.

35:50.293 --> 35:54.148
We talked to Lyz after
we brought you in this afternoon.

35:54.148 --> 35:57.203
You know, l... l-It's...

35:57.203 --> 35:59.984
It's extraordinary.

35:59.984 --> 36:02.171
Y-You... Uh, what? What you...
What you gave her..

36:02.171 --> 36:04.393
what to call it.
Second sight?

36:04.393 --> 36:06.376
Third eye? Sixth sense?

36:06.376 --> 36:11.280
- The gift.
- Gift.

36:11.280 --> 36:14.749
And Lyz said it didn't come to her overnight.

36:14.749 --> 36:16.775
For months,
she couldn't predict a sunrise.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.370
And then all of a sudden it fell into place.

36:19.370 --> 36:22.949
She had a premonition of her son's
death that was bang on the money!

36:22.949 --> 36:27.091
She even had a vision of where the body was.

36:27.091 --> 36:29.956
But there's something she can't figure out.

36:29.956 --> 36:32.015
She only saw one church.

36:32.015 --> 36:36.446
Then the next day,
you told her there were three churches.

36:38.278 --> 36:42.911
How'd you know about the three churches?

36:42.911 --> 36:45.586
It's okay.

36:45.586 --> 36:49.604
How'd you know about the three churches?

36:49.604 --> 36:51.245
Sylvia, I asked you a question.

36:51.245 --> 36:52.696
She doesn't have to answer.

36:52.696 --> 36:55.171
I have to tell the truth.

36:55.171 --> 36:56.469
Julian told me.

36:56.469 --> 36:59.165
That night after he talked with Lyz,

36:59.165 --> 37:02.655
he told me there were three churches.

37:02.655 --> 37:05.655
Julian told you.

37:07.613 --> 37:12.007
So, how'd you know about the three churches?

37:12.007 --> 37:15.254
- Lyz told m...
- No, you have to tell the truth.

37:15.254 --> 37:17.880
- Sylvia.
- Julian, you have to tell them.

37:17.880 --> 37:19.479
Lyz had a vision.

37:19.479 --> 37:21.338
She saw us in a room...

37:21.338 --> 37:24.490
w-with gray walls made of stone.

37:24.490 --> 37:29.351
Sh-She saw a mirror and
a man with a broken neck. Him.

37:29.351 --> 37:32.195
And... And she said that one of us lied,

37:32.195 --> 37:34.750
and then she saw us falling through space.

37:34.750 --> 37:38.657
Julian, w-we have to tell them the truth.

37:41.230 --> 37:44.530
Whoa. R-R-R...
She really saw that?

37:44.530 --> 37:46.638
I gave her the gift.

37:46.638 --> 37:50.596
And-And you have the gift too.

37:54.083 --> 37:56.130
Well, uh,

37:56.130 --> 38:01.116
th-that means that Lyz's vision
must be the real thing, huh, Julian?

38:01.116 --> 38:06.634
Julian, sweetheart,
you just have to tell them the truth.

38:12.357 --> 38:14.487
Come on, Sylvia.

38:14.487 --> 38:17.139
Let's get you out of this gray room,

38:17.139 --> 38:20.139
give you a chance to catch your breath.

38:23.172 --> 38:29.868
J-Julian, tell them, or we're lost.

38:29.868 --> 38:32.034
Lyz saw it.

38:36.904 --> 38:39.565
Lyz saw it.

38:39.565 --> 38:42.293
So, if you lie to us, that means...

38:42.293 --> 38:44.644
you don't believe that Lyz has the gift.

38:44.644 --> 38:50.122
And you don't believe that
Sylvia has the gift either.

38:50.122 --> 38:52.395
You know, l-I'll bet that...

38:52.395 --> 38:56.012
that you can't let on for one
second with Sylvia...

38:56.012 --> 38:59.270
that you don't have faith in her gift,

38:59.270 --> 39:02.231
that you don't believe it.

39:02.231 --> 39:05.821
Because she'd be lost.

39:05.821 --> 39:09.687
Because in her heart and i-in her soul,

39:09.687 --> 39:13.748
she believes in her own clairvoyance.

39:13.748 --> 39:16.016
And why shouldn't she?

39:16.016 --> 39:19.387
Because when she's in these trances,

39:19.387 --> 39:22.421
she sees these things...
she actually sees them.

39:22.421 --> 39:26.293
And when she smells them,
she actually smells them.

39:26.293 --> 39:29.293
Isn't that right, Julian?

39:41.669 --> 39:44.774
Partial epileptic seizures...

39:44.774 --> 39:47.882
caused by a dysfunction...
in the anteromedial

39:47.882 --> 39:51.668
and posterior temporal lobes of the brain...

39:51.668 --> 39:56.592
and characterized by visual
and olfactory hallucinations.

39:56.592 --> 40:01.535
Sights...
and smells.

40:08.709 --> 40:11.709
Julian, how long have you known?

40:14.399 --> 40:16.157
Eight years.

40:18.410 --> 40:21.288
They weren't that frequent at first.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.822
She thought it was a psychic trance.

40:23.822 --> 40:26.542
You thought you'd put her in the act,

40:26.542 --> 40:29.286
puff her up until she believed...

40:29.286 --> 40:32.546
that she could bestow this gift onto other people.

40:32.546 --> 40:35.445
She was convinced that it was a gift from God.

40:35.445 --> 40:37.960
It gave her life purpose.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.960
It made her happy.

40:43.464 --> 40:47.393
Julian, this is Mr. Carver
from the D.A. 's office.

40:47.393 --> 40:51.288
What are we going to tell Sylvia?

40:51.288 --> 40:55.369
Are we gonna tell her that you told the truth...

40:55.369 --> 40:58.943
and that you have faith in her gift?

40:58.943 --> 41:01.720
Or are we gonna tell her that you lied,

41:01.720 --> 41:03.909
because you know that...

41:03.909 --> 41:08.889
her gift is nothing but a haphazard firing of a...

41:08.889 --> 41:13.367
defective brain synapse?

41:15.433 --> 41:17.700
If I testify...

41:19.176 --> 41:22.341
If I testify against Eduardo Mendez,

41:22.341 --> 41:24.987
and I cop to this murder,

41:24.987 --> 41:27.927
what are you gonna do for her?

41:27.927 --> 41:31.670
Last time I got out of jail,
it took me six months to find her.

41:31.670 --> 41:34.101
She was sleeping under an overpass...

41:34.101 --> 41:37.167
on a pee-soaked mattress.

41:37.167 --> 41:39.495
She can't hold a job.

41:39.495 --> 41:42.726
She can't hack the drugs.

41:42.726 --> 41:47.396
She needs someone to take care of her.

41:47.396 --> 41:49.683
If you cooperate fully,

41:49.683 --> 41:51.662
we'll see about getting her into a group home...

41:51.662 --> 41:55.811
near where you'll be incarcerated.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.130
No. But...

41:59.563 --> 42:04.158
No, w-w-we'll make sure she gets in.

42:08.394 --> 42:12.582
Okay.
I'll tell you...

42:12.582 --> 42:15.582
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

42:25.913 --> 42:27.670
You love her.

42:28.643 --> 42:31.643
We don't do very well without each other.

42:39.564 --> 42:41.809
He told us the truth. He told us
everything we need to know.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.084
Oh, thank God.

42:43.084 --> 42:46.084
- So we can go now.
- I can't. I'm sorry.

42:46.562 --> 42:50.750
But, Julian, Lyz said we're not supposed to fall.

42:50.750 --> 42:54.957
It's all right, baby. There'll be
someone there to catch you this time.

42:58.361 --> 43:00.765
Julian.

43:00.765 --> 43:02.644
Julian.

43:03.936 --> 43:07.500
True love. Probably
his only redeeming quality.
