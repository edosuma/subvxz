00:49.246 --> 00:50.799
Do you hear that?

00:53.382 --> 00:58.341
That is the sound
of peaceful tranquility...

00:58.418 --> 01:02.363
Rapunzel! This was supposed
to be a quick bathroom break,

01:02.440 --> 01:04.010
not a meditation.

01:04.087 --> 01:05.907
I was multi-tasking.

01:05.984 --> 01:07.192
Eeee... mmm...

01:07.269 --> 01:10.209
Sorry, Cass,
but look at this view!

01:10.286 --> 01:12.981
I mean, doesn't that
just inspire you?

01:13.145 --> 01:15.083
You know what
I find inspiring?

01:15.207 --> 01:17.529
Progress.
Getting from point "A" to "B"

01:17.606 --> 01:20.689
without stopping to marvel
at every meadow, valley,

01:20.766 --> 01:23.080
pond and knoll along the way.

01:23.197 --> 01:24.222
Look,

01:24.299 --> 01:26.623
Cass, I know
we have to get to...

01:26.700 --> 01:30.451
Wherever these rocks are leading
us, but... aren't you afraid

01:30.528 --> 01:32.851
that if you focus too much
on the road ahead,

01:32.928 --> 01:35.392
you might miss the fun
at your feet?

01:35.876 --> 01:37.858
Don't worry
about me, Raps.

01:37.947 --> 01:40.451
If I want fun,
I know where to find it.

01:40.535 --> 01:43.457
Oh, yeah? And where would that be?
Funeral home?

01:47.027 --> 01:48.576
Hey?
What's this for?

01:52.086 --> 01:53.378
See? Fun.

01:55.387 --> 01:58.652
You know, that meditation
was actually quite relaxing.

01:58.729 --> 02:01.044
Yeah, I feel relaxed.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.972
Nothin' can rattle me.

02:05.457 --> 02:06.911
Is everybody okay?

02:06.988 --> 02:08.814
I thought I heard
a child scream.

02:08.890 --> 02:10.044
It was just Lance.

02:10.121 --> 02:12.588
The wheel's broken.
Don't worry, I can fix it.

02:18.231 --> 02:19.873
Here, here.
Let me.

02:19.950 --> 02:22.431
After all...
I am the strong one.

02:23.196 --> 02:24.309
Wait a minute.

02:24.386 --> 02:28.394
Now don't let this sleek, sinewy,
insanely attractive frame fool you.

02:28.471 --> 02:29.980
I am the strong one.

02:30.057 --> 02:32.983
I'm stronger
than both of you clowns.

02:37.416 --> 02:39.464
- This guy!
- Ha, ha, ha.

02:39.541 --> 02:44.757
Sounds like we got ourselves a good
old-fashioned muscle challenge!

02:45.588 --> 02:47.554
Pa-pow! Pa-pow!

02:48.141 --> 02:50.680
I'm not even flexing, really,
just standing in weird ways.

02:50.757 --> 02:51.968
- Ahhhhhhhh!
- Ooooooooh!

02:52.045 --> 02:53.971
Oh, brother.

02:54.048 --> 02:56.604
- This could be a while.
- That's great!

02:56.681 --> 02:59.266
It means we have time
for a little adventure.

02:59.343 --> 03:03.980
And, seeing as this is the most
beautiful forest I have ever seen,

03:04.057 --> 03:05.882
I say we take a hike.

03:05.959 --> 03:10.460
Take a hike? Fine! I know
when I'm not wanted!

03:12.888 --> 03:16.421
Ugh... Pascal, keep an eye
on him.

03:17.779 --> 03:21.136
I guess it's just
you and me, Caspal.

03:21.213 --> 03:24.968
Come on, Cass! Who knows what we
might find with a little exploring!

03:25.045 --> 03:26.683
I don't know.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.626
Or, we could just
hang out here.

03:28.703 --> 03:29.876
Look at my triceps.

03:29.953 --> 03:31.391
Anybody wanna
play horseshoes?

03:31.468 --> 03:32.930
- Come on!
- Explore it is.

03:33.007 --> 03:34.369
Yes! Ha!

03:34.461 --> 03:35.869
Let's go!

03:40.580 --> 03:42.281
Woo-hoo!

03:53.916 --> 03:56.058
Well, I've seen a lot
of trees in my life,

03:56.135 --> 03:59.693
but these... are...
some of them.

04:01.002 --> 04:03.235
Oh, Cass, look!

04:03.312 --> 04:07.670
The Cliffs of Koto! Oh! I have
always wanted to go there!

04:07.747 --> 04:08.900
Nope!
No can do.

04:08.977 --> 04:10.506
We don't have
that kind of time.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.396
- Says who?
- Whoa!

04:16.803 --> 04:19.036
Soon, Father.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.337
Woo-hoo!

04:36.738 --> 04:39.583
Ugh, do you even
know where you're going?

04:39.660 --> 04:44.952
No, but that's what makes
exploring... whoa-oooooh!

04:45.029 --> 04:46.273
Ohhhhhhh!

04:47.131 --> 04:50.395
- Fun!
- Yeah! Real fun.

04:51.906 --> 04:53.738
What a positively...

04:53.815 --> 04:56.873
- Rapunzel! Get down!
- Brilliant afternoon it is!

04:56.950 --> 04:58.366
Wouldn't you say, Father?

04:58.443 --> 05:02.133
Your assertion, Mother,
is undeniable.

05:02.210 --> 05:07.837
Ohh-kay, we should probably...
visit with the weird people

05:07.914 --> 05:10.106
drinking tea on toadstools
in the middle of nowhere.

05:10.183 --> 05:14.397
Hi, there! My name is Rapunzel,
and this is my friend Cassandra.

05:14.474 --> 05:20.712
And what has brought Ladies Rapunzel and
Cassandra to our most humblest of abodes?

05:20.789 --> 05:24.180
- She dragged me.
- Uh, we took a little detour

05:24.257 --> 05:26.280
out in this
beautiful countryside

05:26.357 --> 05:29.084
to see what kind of adventure
we might find.

05:29.161 --> 05:33.460
Oh! Well... how
positively serendipitous!

05:33.537 --> 05:35.521
Please! Sit!

05:36.359 --> 05:38.569
What do you mean,
serendipitous?

05:38.646 --> 05:42.877
Well, you seek adventure,
and you might say Mother and I

05:42.954 --> 05:44.778
are somewhat aficionados

05:44.855 --> 05:46.778
of fanciful merriment.

05:46.855 --> 05:49.282
I love fanciful merriment!

05:49.359 --> 05:51.522
Wow, what a beautiful teapot.

05:51.599 --> 05:53.717
Yes, it is
quite beautiful.

05:53.794 --> 05:57.556
And yet, its beauty
is a minor benefit

05:57.633 --> 06:00.754
next to its magical properties.

06:00.831 --> 06:03.824
- Magical?
-Indeed, all of what you see here...

06:03.901 --> 06:06.202
The cottage, the toadstools,

06:06.279 --> 06:12.204
and even the birds all exist
because of this teapot.

06:12.281 --> 06:14.288
Uh, I... I don't understand.

06:14.365 --> 06:16.676
How would you like to enjoy

06:16.753 --> 06:21.792
our very modest forest
as... a bird?

06:21.918 --> 06:24.317
Hmm.

06:24.609 --> 06:27.169
Oh... Oh, wait...
Oh, you're serious.

06:27.246 --> 06:30.055
Okay, now we're outta here.

06:30.132 --> 06:32.925
- Ohhh!
- Please, don't be alarmed!

06:33.039 --> 06:34.965
It... It... It... It can't be.

06:35.042 --> 06:36.226
Oh, but it is.

06:36.303 --> 06:39.898
And it is
most wondrously sublime!

06:39.975 --> 06:45.583
For, lest you forget, birds are the
very embodiment of the term "freedom."

06:45.695 --> 06:48.196
You owe it to yourselves
to enjoy this.

06:48.273 --> 06:49.772
Isn't that right, Mother?

06:49.849 --> 06:53.298
Unequivocally.
Seize this opportunity.

06:53.375 --> 06:56.927
Uh, look, um, I... I'm... I'm
usually up for anything,

06:57.004 --> 06:59.161
- but this is, um...
- Insane?

06:59.238 --> 07:01.848
I mean, even if we wanted to,

07:01.925 --> 07:05.743
how... how would we even
do that?

07:05.820 --> 07:09.893
Well, that's the beauty, dear,
you already have.

07:09.970 --> 07:11.833
You've drunk the tea.

07:12.062 --> 07:14.804
Oh! Uh, uh...
I d... I don't believe this!

07:14.881 --> 07:17.177
Are you kidding me?

07:19.849 --> 07:21.076
We're birds!

07:21.144 --> 07:22.606
What do we do?

07:22.723 --> 07:24.089
Whoa... Uh.

07:24.157 --> 07:27.274
What... Ooh. Ooh...
What did you do to us?

07:27.342 --> 07:31.487
Oh, no, please. Please, my crumpets.
There's no need for distress,

07:31.564 --> 07:33.207
I assure you.

07:34.362 --> 07:38.839
Forgive our chicanerous
ruse, dears, it's often the only way

07:38.916 --> 07:45.027
to demonstrate that this gift
is harmless and most temporary.

07:46.561 --> 07:51.691
Our only caveat... you must
return within one hour,

07:51.768 --> 07:56.859
so as to avoid the affliction
we call "avarian totalis."

07:56.936 --> 07:58.311
What does that mean?

07:58.388 --> 08:02.303
It means you'd become,
well... a bird brain.

08:02.380 --> 08:05.622
You'd not only look like a
bird, you'd think like a bird.

08:05.699 --> 08:09.489
Your desire to be the person
you once were would dissolve,

08:09.566 --> 08:13.232
and you'd remain
a bird... forever.

08:13.309 --> 08:17.476
Oh! Oh, wow, since you
put it that way...

08:17.553 --> 08:19.582
give us those eggs now!

08:22.200 --> 08:25.784
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, Cass, Cass!
Did you see that?

08:25.861 --> 08:27.474
I... I just flew!

08:27.551 --> 08:29.420
Ohh! Ohhh!

08:29.541 --> 08:31.228
I'm flying!

08:31.305 --> 08:36.145
Indeed, we only meant to share
our wonderful elixir with you.

08:36.222 --> 08:41.138
Come, now... let us return you to
your original, beautiful state.

08:41.215 --> 08:42.599
Uh, just a second.

08:42.676 --> 08:44.772
Cass?
Can we talk?

08:44.849 --> 08:46.846
- I know this is weird.
- No no no no.

08:46.923 --> 08:49.536
Having 70 feet of
magical hair is weird.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.022
This?
This is full-blown wacko!

08:52.099 --> 08:55.061
Okay, yes!
It's wacko.

08:55.266 --> 08:58.691
But when are we gonna
get this chance again?

08:59.033 --> 09:01.528
They can turn us back
whenever we want.

09:01.605 --> 09:04.455
And Cass... we can fly!

09:09.469 --> 09:11.468
I am so
going to regret this.

09:11.545 --> 09:13.085
Yes!
Thank you!

09:13.162 --> 09:16.178
Okay, we will be back
in one hour.

09:17.953 --> 09:21.193
Mm-hm... we're
counting on it.

Hey, Blondie. Look at this!

11:36.115 --> 11:37.951
One-armed pushups!

11:38.711 --> 11:40.008
Blondie?

11:40.135 --> 11:41.266
Cass?

11:41.366 --> 11:43.765
Wait a minute, guys.
Where are Cass and Rapunzel?

11:43.842 --> 11:47.507
Let me look for them. Could they be
under this big, heavy tree trunk?

11:49.507 --> 11:51.829
- No!
- Maybe they're not under a tree,

11:51.897 --> 11:53.216
maybe they're up one!

11:53.293 --> 11:56.452
I didn't see 'em,
but I'll check again!

11:57.160 --> 11:59.663
Nope, not up there! No!

12:02.968 --> 12:05.964
Guys! Can we stop showing
off just for a minute,

12:06.041 --> 12:08.577
and focus
on finding the girls?

12:09.603 --> 12:10.950
Come on, guys!

12:11.027 --> 12:13.347
- Whoaaa! - Whoaaa!
- Whoaaa! - Whoaaa!

12:13.424 --> 12:16.010
- Aaah!
- Ohhh!

12:16.087 --> 12:20.298
Oh! How lovely. Look, Father!
Unforeseen guests.

12:20.375 --> 12:23.405
What a delightful
transpiration!

12:23.516 --> 12:27.288
Join us...
for a spot of tea?

12:31.947 --> 12:33.680
Okay, Raps,
are we done yet?

12:33.757 --> 12:37.397
Just a little longer. This is
the most amazing...

12:37.712 --> 12:39.672
Wait! Did I just...

12:39.764 --> 12:41.751
Yeah, you did!

12:42.048 --> 12:43.641
So did you!

12:43.728 --> 12:45.024
Oh, no!

12:45.233 --> 12:50.655
We're getting birdbrain! We need to
head back! Now!

12:55.705 --> 12:57.901
That was amazing!

12:57.978 --> 12:59.784
Thank you so much!

12:59.852 --> 13:03.552
But now , we'd like
to be changed back.

13:03.638 --> 13:06.440
I'm sure you would, dear.

13:06.517 --> 13:11.452
But it pains me to say,
we have different designs.

13:12.557 --> 13:15.463
We need those
to change back!

13:15.540 --> 13:18.672
I'm afraid we shan't oblige,
my little chickadees.

13:18.749 --> 13:22.882
For you see, we don't
want you to change back.

13:22.959 --> 13:29.628
We want you to become the newest
addition to our aviary menagerie.

13:31.148 --> 13:35.118
Think of all this
as an avian art collection,

13:35.195 --> 13:39.419
to which we're always
adding new pieces.

13:39.487 --> 13:40.497
Ohh!

13:40.599 --> 13:44.292
Wait!
Those are all... people!

13:44.369 --> 13:50.162
Indeed, for people make the most
beautiful, one-of-a-kind birds.

13:50.247 --> 13:54.519
Come now, darlings.
Off to your new home.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.993
Cass, I should
have listened to you.

13:59.070 --> 14:01.758
- I just wanted to show you...
- Show me how to seize the moment?

14:01.835 --> 14:03.765
Here's what the moment
got us.

14:04.712 --> 14:06.218
I know you
take a lot of pride

14:06.295 --> 14:08.587
in your irrepressible,
carefree spirit.

14:08.664 --> 14:10.097
It's what makes you you.

14:10.174 --> 14:13.001
But did you ever stop to think
that maybe that attitude can be

14:13.078 --> 14:14.728
a bit selfish sometimes?

14:14.805 --> 14:16.040
I'm sorry.

14:16.117 --> 14:18.745
This trail of black rocks
is your destiny,

14:18.822 --> 14:21.394
but I dropped everything to make
sure you get to the end of it.

14:21.471 --> 14:24.570
I'm taking this seriously.
Why aren't you?

14:25.424 --> 14:27.205
Because I'm scared.

14:28.109 --> 14:32.141
You're right, Cass.
These rocks are my destiny,

14:32.218 --> 14:34.062
and that's terrifying.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.330
What if they lead to...

14:36.407 --> 14:39.429
somewhere I'm never supposed
to come back from?

14:39.980 --> 14:42.015
We're home!

14:42.900 --> 14:45.225
Our friends are
gonna come looking for us,

14:45.302 --> 14:48.968
and when they do,
you are in trouble!

14:49.205 --> 14:52.456
I don't think your friends are
gonna be much help, Blondie.

14:53.316 --> 14:55.174
You're all birds?

14:55.251 --> 14:58.257
- Well, I'm the strongest bird...
- Not the time, Lance.

15:00.114 --> 15:02.048
You know, I like to
think that I'm the prepared

15:02.125 --> 15:04.181
kind of guy. Type of guy
who's ready for anything

15:04.249 --> 15:05.656
this crazy world
throws my way.

15:05.733 --> 15:07.716
But this bird thing,
I can't say I saw it comin'.

15:07.793 --> 15:10.762
Ugh, this is
all my fault.

15:10.839 --> 15:12.419
Her squawks are getting
more frequent.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.339
If we don't break one of
those eggs over her soon,

15:14.441 --> 15:17.205
she's gonna go full bird.
We all are.

15:17.282 --> 15:18.480
I got a plan!

15:18.557 --> 15:21.560
We should go over there, get the
eggs and turn us back into people.

15:21.637 --> 15:23.923
Good thinking. And how
are we gonna get over there?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.430
That's where
the plan falls apart.

15:26.507 --> 15:30.909
I guess if we can't bring the
eggs to the cage,

15:30.986 --> 15:33.315
we have to bring the cage
to the eggs!

15:36.032 --> 15:37.238
Do it with me!

15:37.315 --> 15:38.700
All right!
Let's go!

15:38.777 --> 15:40.831
Flap like you've never
flapped before!

15:40.908 --> 15:43.337
I have never flapped before.

15:43.454 --> 15:45.661
Okay, now...!

15:46.035 --> 15:47.503
Whoaaaa!

15:47.911 --> 15:49.378
We did it!

15:51.433 --> 15:52.665
Maybe we can get out!

15:55.042 --> 15:57.036
Yes!
We can totally do this!

16:01.006 --> 16:04.559
Oh, you see that?
Together, we're unstoppable!

16:04.628 --> 16:06.191
- That's right!
- You know it!

16:06.268 --> 16:08.165
And it doesn't matter
who's strongest.

16:08.242 --> 16:10.956
- It totally matters!
- Oh, it most definitely does.

16:11.033 --> 16:13.555
Yeah, you're right,
come on, who are we kidding?

16:14.310 --> 16:16.549
What is the meaning of this?

16:16.626 --> 16:20.524
Don't worry, Father.
Allow me.

16:28.269 --> 16:30.239
Ahhh! Ahhhh!

16:38.300 --> 16:41.122
Anyone planning on a
premature egress will be

16:41.199 --> 16:43.056
most disappointed

16:43.133 --> 16:45.991
I'll draw the hawk away,
you guys get those eggs!

16:54.458 --> 16:57.951
Oh, my dear girl,
you haven't a chance.

17:05.358 --> 17:10.355
That's quite far enough,
you... you guttersnipes!

17:10.432 --> 17:13.329
Guttersnipe? You just
crossed a line, Dad.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.872
Ha-ha-ha, come on, guys!

17:14.949 --> 17:16.002
Let's get him!

17:16.079 --> 17:17.097
Gaah!

17:17.174 --> 17:18.406
The horror!

17:18.483 --> 17:19.564
Aah! Aaah!

17:19.641 --> 17:23.480
I will go get those eggs!
You guys free the other birds!

17:27.684 --> 17:29.159
Here you go, Eugene!

17:29.341 --> 17:31.271
Ooh! Ahh!

17:31.387 --> 17:33.543
Eugene?
Thank you!

17:36.507 --> 17:38.105
- Yes...
- Wha!

17:53.175 --> 17:55.409
You're free!

18:12.131 --> 18:13.528
Aaah!

18:13.992 --> 18:16.173
This bird stuff isn't
half bad!

18:28.377 --> 18:31.315
Ugh!
Ahh, is that all you've got?

18:37.453 --> 18:39.286
Ohh! Ohh!

18:40.254 --> 18:41.721
Ha-ha, we did it!

18:41.877 --> 18:42.884
We beat her!

18:42.961 --> 18:44.588
Woo-hoo-hoo!

18:44.908 --> 18:46.931
- Lance, would you hurry it up?
- I'm trying!

18:48.281 --> 18:50.258
Uh! There's only one egg left!

18:50.515 --> 18:53.570
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoooo!

18:54.009 --> 18:56.776
Raps, I take it all back.
That was...

18:56.853 --> 19:00.219
Oh... okay... okay, okay,
that was abrupt.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.480
But let's turn you back now.

19:02.557 --> 19:04.192
All right, where's an egg?

19:05.536 --> 19:08.625
Heh... There's
another egg, right?

19:09.994 --> 19:12.069
You used the last egg
on me?

19:12.822 --> 19:15.570
No, but that means
you can't... No.

19:25.545 --> 19:29.327
Oh, Raps?
You're my best friend.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.930
Oh... Please, don't leave me.

19:52.361 --> 19:53.595
Where are the other eggs?

19:53.672 --> 19:54.985
Give me another egg!

19:55.062 --> 19:56.433
But there are no more!

19:56.510 --> 19:58.814
Please!
Have mercy!

19:58.891 --> 20:00.234
Aah!

20:02.781 --> 20:09.047
No! I'll never be able
to make my tea again!

20:09.487 --> 20:11.953
That's what I was counting on.

20:27.086 --> 20:29.568
Why so glum, chum?

20:29.816 --> 20:31.131
Shorty?

20:33.302 --> 20:36.151
Oh, please, please work.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.157
Raps!

20:44.234 --> 20:48.551
Oh! Ugh! Am I the only
one craving worms?

20:48.628 --> 20:50.375
I know I am.

20:51.812 --> 20:54.369
Mm-hm-mm-hm-mm-mm-mm...

21:00.099 --> 21:02.454
That's weird,
I'm a person.

21:08.778 --> 21:13.071
Well, I guess if we learned anything,
it's that we are stronger together, huh?

21:13.148 --> 21:14.822
- You know it.
- Agreed.

21:21.635 --> 21:23.135
Listen, Raps?

21:23.293 --> 21:25.489
What you said before
about being afraid?

21:25.566 --> 21:27.909
It's okay.
I'd be afraid, too.

21:27.986 --> 21:30.157
But I want you to remember
that no matter what

21:30.234 --> 21:32.429
you have to face
at the end of this road,

21:32.506 --> 21:35.181
you're not going
to face it alone.

21:35.397 --> 21:36.706
Thanks, Cass.

21:36.783 --> 21:38.517
Hnn... Really.

21:39.035 --> 21:40.691
All right,
let's lift this thing.

21:40.768 --> 21:42.040
And I should probably...

21:42.117 --> 21:46.198
Guys, sorry, but,
we really gotta get going.

21:46.275 --> 21:47.393
Oh, yeah, I mean...
You know,

21:47.470 --> 21:49.261
- of course.
- Uh-huh, yeah. -I... I... I think

21:49.338 --> 21:51.330
we should probably
hit the road.

21:53.905 --> 21:54.939
All right! I'll get it!

21:55.007 --> 21:57.424
No, Eugene, we got it!
