WEBVTT

00:00.520 --> 00:01.600
I'm hank.

00:01.600 --> 00:05.390
I was your typicalemergency
room doctor...Until I got fired.

00:05.390 --> 00:08.860
You let a billionairehospital trustee
die to save some kidoff the street.

00:08.860 --> 00:10.930
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:10.930 --> 00:11.870
This is my brother.

00:11.870 --> 00:13.670
I'm evan R.Lawson,C.P.A.

00:13.670 --> 00:17.570
He took meaway from my
troubles and to the hamptons,

00:17.570 --> 00:21.040
and suddenly,I had a chance to
become a whole newkind of doctor.

00:21.040 --> 00:25.860
Turns out the wealthyand notsowealthy out
here could use a guywho makes house calls,

00:25.860 --> 00:29.950
so I got a second
chanceto do what I do best.

00:32.320 --> 00:39.420
* Comes and goes like the fitsand
dizzy spells like the weather *

00:40.010 --> 00:43.530
so welcome to the
inauguralhankmed staff meeting.

00:43.530 --> 00:45.070
I love your blouse,divya.

00:45.070 --> 00:46.300
Goodgood day to you.

00:46.300 --> 00:49.820
First on thisevening's
agenda,uh,business development.

00:49.820 --> 00:52.110
It's 11:00 A.M.

00:52.110 --> 00:54.500
Oh,yeah.No,I wrote
this last night.Sorry.

00:54.500 --> 00:58.770
Yeah,since I left the E.R.,The two things I
miss least are pelvic examsand staff meetings,

00:58.770 --> 01:00.160
and not necessarilyin that order.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.850
Evan,can't you justsend out an email?

01:02.850 --> 01:03.540
Yeah,okay.

01:03.540 --> 01:06.060
You know what?I'll send an
email.That's great.Okay,cool,divya.

01:06.060 --> 01:07.430
I'm sending an emailto both of you.

01:07.430 --> 01:10.750
It says I workedfor three days
on this multimediapresentation

01:10.750 --> 01:13.230
and that you're gonna sit
down,shut up,and enjoy it.

01:13.230 --> 01:15.540
There.Sent.How's that sound?

01:15.540 --> 01:17.040
How's it goingover there,stu?

01:17.040 --> 01:19.200
Still working on it,mr.Lawson.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.420
Okay,that's cool.Keep it up.

01:20.420 --> 01:24.130
Was it really necessary to
retain an a/v specialistfor this?

01:24.130 --> 01:25.750
Well we should re"shedule"the meeting.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.880
Motion to re"shedule"not seconded.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.480
Motion fails.Moving on.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.740
There's no stopping
himwhen he's like this.

01:30.740 --> 01:33.370
The bylaws to our tree
housewere eight pages long

01:33.370 --> 01:35.040
and it was an imaginarytree house.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.800
So as I projected,the
hankmed balance sheetis robust

01:37.800 --> 01:39.400
as we approach the
endof our fiscal summer.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.950
All I needed to hear.Thanks,ev.

01:41.950 --> 01:44.920
Here,stu,drink this.It should help.

01:44.920 --> 01:51.880
But our gold standard is turning ouronetime
patients into retainerpayingclients.

01:51.880 --> 01:56.190
Patients into clients.This is our
new motto.Let's all say it together.

01:56.190 --> 01:59.740
Patients

02:00.770 --> 02:03.430
Patients Okay,all together now.

02:03.430 --> 02:06.440
Patients Excuse me for one second.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.000
- Thanks,mr.Lawson.
- Absolutely.Did it work for you?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.740
- Sorry,mr.Lawson.
- Cool.That's all right.

02:15.740 --> 02:21.030
So our research departmenthas shown
that when our cfo attendshouse calls,

02:21.030 --> 02:22.930
client conversion triples.

02:22.930 --> 02:26.240
Has our researchdepartment also found
that we haveno research department?

02:26.240 --> 02:27.790
Funny.That's really funny.

02:27.790 --> 02:31.180
Guys,I proposethat for
select residential quadrants,

02:31.180 --> 02:33.990
I join you on visits to
providethe onsite upsell

02:33.990 --> 02:36.160
and administer
customersatisfaction surveys.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.240
Great idea.Awesome
presentation.I'm off to the lab.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.720
Awesome presentation?Okay.Really?

02:41.720 --> 02:43.510
Wicked.

02:44.810 --> 02:48.030
Hankmed.How can we make
youfeel better today?

02:57.660 --> 02:59.330
I can't believe you're here.

02:59.330 --> 03:01.830
You better respectthe patient.

03:01.830 --> 03:05.190
Oh,my god.I googled them.She's a
swimsuit modeland he's filthy rich.

03:05.190 --> 03:07.520
So,yeah,I respect them both.Trust me.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.260
So,uh,hi.

03:09.260 --> 03:11.740
Are we treating,like,a pterodactyl?

03:11.740 --> 03:14.120
No,my husband.We got
married here yesterday.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.290
- Oh,congratulations.
- Oh,that's so cool.

03:15.290 --> 03:16.460
Thank you.It was beautiful.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.740
You know,I wanted to
honeymoonin the real amazon,

03:18.740 --> 03:22.440
but my husband alanis deathly afraid
to fly,so he rented this for us.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.770
That's a lovely gesture.

03:23.770 --> 03:27.350
It was untilthe pollen or
something set off his allergies.

03:27.350 --> 03:31.250
I've said "bless you"so many times,I'm
starting to soundlike the pope.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.300
Well,you look way sexierin your work
clothes,so you got nothingto worry about.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.980
- Evan.
- What?

03:34.980 --> 03:38.410
Be quiet,be professional,behave.

03:38.410 --> 03:39.820
But mostly be quiet.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.540
Oh,my god.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.420
Alan!

03:43.420 --> 03:44.560
Alan,honey?

03:44.560 --> 03:46.720
The doctorsyou called are here.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.680
I'm so glad you're here.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.160
I was just droppinga
sample off at the lab.

04:09.160 --> 04:12.110
It's okay.You don't have
to explainwhy you're here.

04:12.110 --> 04:14.980
Right.So...

04:14.980 --> 04:16.350
how have you been?

04:16.350 --> 04:18.360
You know,for the pastcouple of days?

04:18.360 --> 04:19.420
Pretty good.

04:19.420 --> 04:20.350
You?

04:20.350 --> 04:22.570
Pretty good.

04:23.050 --> 04:27.690
So what are you up tofor
the next couple of days?

04:27.690 --> 04:29.330
I'm sorry.I know what we said,but...

04:29.330 --> 04:31.760
- it's easier said than done.
- Who knew it'd be this hard?

04:31.760 --> 04:35.000
Yeah,and we're obviously still
going to be bumpinginto each other,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.180
so we do to makesome ground rules.

04:38.180 --> 04:39.450
Right.Right.

04:39.450 --> 04:41.670
And what's,uhwhat's fair game?

04:41.670 --> 04:43.250
And what's not.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.320
Yeah,but more what is.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.430
Excuse me,ms.Casey.

04:46.430 --> 04:51.270
Um,the emergency arrhythmiapatient we admitted
yesterdayis checking himself out A.M.A.

04:51.270 --> 04:54.140
Well,did we trytalking sense into him?

04:54.140 --> 04:56.510
Okay,all right.I'll get dr.Weisman.

04:56.510 --> 04:58.670
Excuse me.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.160
I signed fewer formswhen
I bought my house.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.310
Those your kids?

05:10.720 --> 05:15.070
Nothing quite likeleaving a
hospital to raise your spirits.

05:15.070 --> 05:18.320
Excuse me,sir?I'm dr.Lawson.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.190
I'd love to talk,doc,but
I'm not staying.

05:20.190 --> 05:21.780
Yeah,neither am I.I
don't even work here.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.630
You mind ifI check your chart?

05:23.630 --> 05:27.170
All yours.I'm done with it.Here you go.

05:27.170 --> 05:28.480
Thanks.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.040
Mr.Kingsley.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.930
You were admittedjust yesterday
for hypertrophiccardiomyopathy?

05:32.930 --> 05:36.200
Little stutter step with
myticker,but I feel great now.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.310
So they adjustedyour
medications and stabilized you,

05:39.310 --> 05:41.040
but that doesn't mean you should leave.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.180
Look,I know somepatients check out against
medical advicefor financial reasons.

05:45.180 --> 05:46.910
Luckily,my wifebought us good insurance.

05:46.910 --> 05:48.220
Then use it.Stay.

05:48.220 --> 05:49.830
You have a very seriousheart condition.

05:49.830 --> 05:52.720
I also havea very serious work deadline.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.570
If I don't make my deadline,I
can't make a living,

05:54.570 --> 05:57.120
and then my wife can'tbuy
us health insurance.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.200
Ironic,huh?

05:58.200 --> 06:01.410
Almost poetic,but still not a
good enough reasonto leave here.

06:01.410 --> 06:03.400
Don't worry.My studio is lowstress.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.990
Less stressfulthan this place.

06:04.990 --> 06:09.340
I meditate,live organically,and
the little ladydotes on me.

06:09.340 --> 06:11.010
That's great.All great.

06:11.010 --> 06:14.110
But you still needmedical supervision.

06:14.110 --> 06:15.520
Are you a cardiologist?

06:15.520 --> 06:17.330
No,just a friendof the hospital.

06:17.330 --> 06:18.910
I'm a private physician.

06:18.910 --> 06:21.150
Private as in house calls?

06:21.150 --> 06:22.860
Problem solved.You're
hiredand I'm out of here.

06:22.860 --> 06:23.870
No,no,no.That's not what I meant.

06:23.870 --> 06:27.210
Doc,I'm gonna walk out that door
and go hometo my wife,no matter what.

06:27.210 --> 06:29.460
If you come with me,at
leastI have supervision,right?

06:29.460 --> 06:31.390
- Yeah,but 
- mr.Kingsley?

06:31.390 --> 06:34.010
I'm glad you're still here.The
cardiologistis on his way.

06:34.010 --> 06:41.270
No need.I signed your formsand
I'm on my way with my new doctor.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.540
Ms.Casey?

06:43.540 --> 06:47.630
Ms.Casey,they need youat
critical care immediately.

07:26.630 --> 07:29.540
My wife and I created them 15 years ago.

07:29.540 --> 07:31.980
Must be cool to work with your wife.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.740
You're not married,are you?

07:33.740 --> 07:35.580
No.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.100
Our first book sold 50 copies.

07:39.100 --> 07:43.690
Ten books later,"zoomer and jewel"
are local icons like martha stewart...

07:43.690 --> 07:45.080
but they've never done hard time.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.690
Right.Right.

07:47.920 --> 07:51.650
These books,they are the
only thing that worked out.

07:51.650 --> 07:53.540
We get one good paycheck a year.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.830
God knows we need it.

07:55.830 --> 07:59.180
Still,this seems like a lot
to illustrate in three days.

07:59.180 --> 08:01.930
Which is why I called our
publisher for an extension.

08:01.930 --> 08:08.220
For someone who works in children's books,that
lady knows a lot of very nasty words.

08:08.220 --> 08:13.110
Hank,this is julie,the writer.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.100
And my wife.

08:15.100 --> 08:18.630
I just went to the hospital and all
they'd tell me is that you checked out.

08:18.630 --> 08:22.510
They sent me home,so I found
a private doctor.Check him out.

08:22.960 --> 08:27.790
Cut veggies,tea,and a hank are
no substitute for a hospital.

08:27.790 --> 08:30.790
The hank tried to tell him that.

08:31.140 --> 08:34.630
Well,I'm feeling zen,which means
it's time to get back to work.

08:34.630 --> 08:37.409
Our little guys look bored.

08:37.409 --> 08:42.610
Yeah,well,they didn't justhave an adventure called
"zoomer and jewel takea ride in an ambulance.

08:42.610 --> 08:46.040
" You have.Honey,you
have gotto take it easy.

08:46.040 --> 08:50.080
The scanning shop needs
myproofs in three days,right?

08:50.080 --> 08:51.750
- Yes.
- And?

08:51.750 --> 08:54.270
And we have the readingat the library.

08:54.270 --> 08:57.910
We do a sneak readingfor every
release.It's our good luck tradition.

08:57.910 --> 09:01.420
That's funny.I have my owngood luck
tradition where I give the patientan exam.

09:01.420 --> 09:02.690
Soon.

09:02.690 --> 09:05.850
Honey,what's so hardabout
sticking to page count?

09:05.850 --> 09:08.890
12 pages,you said.Not 16.

09:08.890 --> 09:11.980
So exactly what kind ofanimals
are these little guys?

09:11.980 --> 09:14.220
- Tasmanian devils.
- Badgers.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.620
We've never really agreed.

09:16.620 --> 09:17.560
Then how do you draw them?

09:17.560 --> 09:20.130
- Vaguely.
- You know what?Maybe they're woodchucks.

09:20.130 --> 09:22.790
Did you ever think woodchuck?Sorry.

09:22.790 --> 09:26.650
Let's do the exam now.Get my stuff.

09:28.660 --> 09:32.440
So you should know,alan,that
I'm a humongous fanof your work.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.200
I really just being in your
houseand this close to you is,like,

09:36.200 --> 09:40.810
whoa,'cause you're like a rock star
of stock portfoliotracking software.

09:40.810 --> 09:43.830
And it's just,you knowit's
just such an honor.

09:43.830 --> 09:45.770
It's always niceto meet a fan.

09:45.770 --> 09:46.650
Absolutely.

09:46.650 --> 09:49.780
Now that we've all mingled,I
should treatmr.Ryder's allergies.

09:49.780 --> 09:53.670
Right.Rachel,honey,why
don't yougo enjoy the beach?

09:53.670 --> 09:55.400
Because you knowit reminds me of work.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.190
You think swimsuit modelingis easy?

09:57.190 --> 09:59.510
The woman can't enjoythe beach anymore.

09:59.510 --> 10:01.460
Maybe I could go shopping.

10:01.460 --> 10:05.670
You're in,like,300 different
magazine and billboard ads.

10:05.670 --> 10:07.950
Shouldn't shoppingremind
you of work too?

10:07.950 --> 10:10.920
I have selective memory.

10:15.330 --> 10:16.550
Evan?

10:16.550 --> 10:18.180
- Will you excuse us?
- Wait.

10:18.180 --> 10:19.710
I spoke to you on the phone.

10:19.710 --> 10:22.260
You said your businessis discreet?

10:22.260 --> 10:24.490
Oh,yeah.Hankmed inventeddiscretion,man.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.790
We're just,you know,too
discreet to publicize it.

10:26.790 --> 10:29.380
Fine.My problem isn't allergies.

10:29.380 --> 10:30.570
You're the doctor?

10:30.570 --> 10:32.130
Physician assistant.

10:32.130 --> 10:36.410
And as a medical practitioner,I'm
obligated to maintainconfidentiality.

10:36.410 --> 10:41.660
- What she said.
- For some reason,I assumed "hankmed" meant a doctor named hank.

10:41.660 --> 10:44.450
You see?I should get a branding
awardfor coming up with that.

10:44.450 --> 10:49.030
The doctor can come
lateror I can help you now.

10:50.130 --> 10:51.040
Okay.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.360
Maybe you can help.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.640
It started last night.Pain when I go.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.430
Internet saida kidney
stone.Right?It'll pass?

10:59.430 --> 11:01.460
The internet saysa lot of things.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.310
Did it begin in your backand descend?

11:03.310 --> 11:04.890
No.

11:04.890 --> 11:05.760
Should it have?

11:05.760 --> 11:07.500
Most kidney stones do.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.150
Where does it hurt precisely?

11:15.170 --> 11:17.410
I doubt it's a kidney stone.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.890
I'll have to take a
lookat your genitals.

11:19.890 --> 11:24.180
Wouldn't the physiciando
that while you assist?

11:24.180 --> 11:26.070
Can't you just give me
a pillI can take for now?

11:26.070 --> 11:28.790
I'm paying quite a bitfor
you to not be a doctor.

11:28.790 --> 11:29.700
- I understand that 
- you know what?

11:29.700 --> 11:32.590
- Maybe we don't haveto do an exam 
- evan!

11:32.590 --> 11:34.750
May I speak with you?

11:34.750 --> 11:40.330
Absolutely,divya.Give us one
second,alan.We'll be right back.

11:45.270 --> 11:46.820
What do youthink you're doing?

11:46.820 --> 11:48.440
I'm shutting you down,nurse guantanamo.

11:48.440 --> 11:49.570
What are you doing?

11:49.570 --> 11:50.890
Have you ever heardof bedside manner?

11:50.890 --> 11:52.650
This isn'tabout bedside manner.

11:52.650 --> 11:56.730
This is aboutdiagnosing a
problem and helping a patient.

11:56.730 --> 12:00.870
You don't need an M.D.At the end of
your name to know what's going on here.

12:00.870 --> 12:04.260
Well,duh.But the guy obviouslydoesn't
want to tell a cfo and his P.A.

12:04.260 --> 12:06.500
That his brandnew wife gave him an std.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.050
Where's your trademarkhankmed tact?

12:08.050 --> 12:10.850
People pay to be treated,not coddled.

12:10.850 --> 12:15.480
And I don't givea tinker's
curse for your marketing drivel.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.500
I can't debate youif you talk
gibberish that soundskind of like

12:17.500 --> 12:20.780
something a chimney sweep
from mary poppins would say,

12:20.780 --> 12:23.670
but you can't cure him
unlessyou win his trust first.

12:23.670 --> 12:24.500
So work with him.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.220
Guys,shouldI call someone else?

12:27.220 --> 12:28.700
An actual doctor,maybe?

12:28.700 --> 12:30.290
Patients into
clients.Patients into clients.

12:30.290 --> 12:35.380
Say it.It's empowering.And it's
hanksanctioned too,remember?Here we go.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.320
Mr.Ryder,I apologize.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.710
I believe you mayhave an infection.

12:40.710 --> 12:42.770
I'll need to take some
bloodand urine samples...

12:42.770 --> 12:45.040
urine samples probably.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.160
To confirm the diagnosis.

12:47.160 --> 12:51.710
Meantime,I can prescribesome
antibiotics and painkillers.

12:51.710 --> 12:52.910
Will that be sufficient?

12:52.910 --> 12:54.200
Delightful.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.700
On behalf of me and
my genitals,thank you.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.490
Absolutely.Well,we aimto
please all of you,so...

13:00.490 --> 13:03.450
great.That was great.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.260
Breathe in.

13:08.260 --> 13:09.540
Out.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.520
Yeah,you can have high
teawhen the exam is done.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.230
Breathe in.

13:14.230 --> 13:16.410
Out.

13:17.350 --> 13:18.280
Okay.

13:18.280 --> 13:21.660
Pulse is down to 60 from 70
whenyou left the hospital.

13:21.660 --> 13:24.130
Blood pressure's120 over
75.You're doing better.

13:24.130 --> 13:26.840
I told you I'd be fine.Natural living.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.980
Food from my organic gardenbeats
hospital food any day.

13:29.980 --> 13:32.850
The rocks in your
gardenbeat hospital food.

13:32.850 --> 13:37.020
But hamptons heritage put youon the right
medications calcium channel blockersand furosemide.

13:37.020 --> 13:42.230
I prefer the hospital food.Now,if
we're done,I'll get to work.

13:44.530 --> 13:47.450
Hey,you know what?Tell me
aboutall these characters.

13:47.450 --> 13:48.950
I mean,where do you guysget your ideas?

13:48.950 --> 13:51.430
My wife gets them...

13:51.430 --> 13:53.450
from me.

13:53.450 --> 13:55.530
Life experience,I guess.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.590
Zoomer's always beenthe mischievous one.

13:57.590 --> 13:58.650
The little white one?

13:58.650 --> 14:01.070
No,that's jewel,the good girl.

14:01.070 --> 14:02.800
She's harder to illustratethan he is.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.700
It's all aboutshading the white.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.560
Speaking of shading...

14:06.560 --> 14:09.990
your wife shouldknow the truth
about how you leftthe hospital.

14:11.610 --> 14:14.110
A year ago I found outI had this thing.

14:14.110 --> 14:18.680
And I know julie is
justtrying to protect me,but...

14:18.680 --> 14:23.420
you know,I like illustrating for
kids,not being treated like one.

14:23.420 --> 14:26.910
This isn't just a thing.Part
of your heart is too big.

14:26.910 --> 14:29.980
It's crucial that you monitorand medicate
it so you don't developcomplications.

14:29.980 --> 14:31.510
I do.Look at my numbers.

14:31.510 --> 14:33.030
And we should talkabout
longterm options.

14:33.030 --> 14:35.210
I mean,there are surgeries
youmight be a candidate for.

14:35.210 --> 14:37.830
Longterm?You sound like
the hospitalI just left.

14:37.830 --> 14:39.780
Let's talk longterm later.

14:39.780 --> 14:45.560
I hired you to get methrough
the next three days.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.230
Come in.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.850
Oh,uh,I'm just gonna come on in.

15:10.270 --> 15:12.200
I'm glad you came by.You got my message?

15:12.200 --> 15:16.750
I did and I decidedto respond in person.

15:17.530 --> 15:20.890
Look,I reallyam sorry about
what happened todaywith zack.

15:20.890 --> 15:23.150
Zack?

15:23.150 --> 15:25.400
Oh,you mean mr.Kingsley.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.710
How is my patient,anyway?

15:27.710 --> 15:29.220
He's doing well.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.690
Jill,look,he was alreadyleaving hamptons
heritage before I even got there.

15:32.690 --> 15:35.050
At least now hehas medical supervision.

15:35.050 --> 15:39.500
What you did,hank,is the
definition of "not fair game.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.740
" What do I tell my board membersif
they ask me why my boyfriendI'm sorry,

15:42.740 --> 15:46.110
exboyfriend poached a
seriouscardio case from me?

15:46.110 --> 15:50.260
Tell them this was
unintendedand in no way personal.

15:50.260 --> 15:52.830
And that they're givingtheir
hospital a little too much credit.

15:52.830 --> 15:54.830
What the helldoes that mean?

15:54.830 --> 15:55.720
Let's face it.

15:55.720 --> 15:59.170
Zack wasn't reallygonna undergo his
cardiac surgeryat hamptons heritage anyway.

15:59.170 --> 16:01.270
Really?And why not?

16:01.270 --> 16:04.480
Look,it's a great
hospitalfor some things.

16:04.480 --> 16:09.430
But,jill,if you hadhis condition,I'd
want you at a largerspecialized facility.

16:09.430 --> 16:13.990
My tiny unspecializedfacility
is full of dedicated people

16:13.990 --> 16:18.220
who save lives every
day,just like you used to.

16:18.220 --> 16:23.280
It just so happens,hank,you don't
have to get firedto be a good doctor.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.050
come on,please?

16:36.050 --> 16:37.940
Dude,I didn't evenuse it yet.

16:37.940 --> 16:40.250
Sorry,mr.Lawson.It is a 24hour rental.

16:40.250 --> 16:45.460
I know,but can a brotherget
a grace period?I mean

16:45.660 --> 16:47.230
Okay.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.350
All right,thank you,stu.

16:49.350 --> 16:51.690
Now allow meto walk you
through the financial benchmarks

16:51.690 --> 16:53.070
that wedid not get through yesterday.

16:53.070 --> 16:54.880
Actually,medical updatestake priority.

16:54.880 --> 16:55.990
I know,butokay,but we find...

16:55.990 --> 16:58.220
divya,what's the statusof
our fake allergy patient?

16:58.220 --> 17:01.340
He wasn't cooperative,but
it's most likelya simple std.

17:01.340 --> 17:02.560
He probably won'tthink it's simple.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.950
When are lab resultsexpected?

17:03.950 --> 17:05.690
They'll be emailedany time now.

17:05.690 --> 17:09.940
Meanwhile,I started ceftriaxoneand
doxycyxline and oxycodone for the pain.

17:09.940 --> 17:12.180
All right,well,widespectrum
antibiotics was a good call.

17:12.180 --> 17:15.170
Speaking of good
calls,did you make yours?

17:15.170 --> 17:16.460
No,I haven't called her yet.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.650
You should send flowers.I
recommend peonies.

17:18.650 --> 17:20.829
Thank you.

17:21.510 --> 17:24.119
- Again with this?
- Not again.Still.

17:24.119 --> 17:28.030
Wife's about to kill me.We just
had a baby boy and I'mkee I'm kee

17:28.700 --> 17:30.580
I'm keeping him up at night.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.870
All right,come here.Let me take a look.

17:32.870 --> 17:34.740
Look,you only delayedthe
inevitable yesterday.

17:34.740 --> 17:36.710
When the std resultscome back positive,

17:36.710 --> 17:38.690
someone's going to haveto
discuss it with them.

17:38.690 --> 17:41.070
Well,that'll bea real dr.Phil moment.

17:41.070 --> 17:43.910
Here is theircontract and invoice.

17:43.910 --> 17:47.810
You take care of thatand
I'll take care of him.

17:47.810 --> 17:50.510
Okay,this is tetracaine.It's
a mild anesthetic.

17:50.510 --> 17:53.880
It'll relax the larynxand end the spasm.

18:02.980 --> 18:04.640
Thanks.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.930
- Thank you!Thank you.
- No sweat.You got it.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.560
I'm giving you guysan extension.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.520
Dude!Dude.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.500
All right,guys,is the case handled?

18:16.500 --> 18:18.580
I really thinkshe needs backup,doctor.

18:18.580 --> 18:21.320
I've got it.I'm going back there today.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.840
Alone.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.350
Oh,and I read zack's file.

18:24.350 --> 18:26.820
His noncompliance
soundslike a liability.

18:26.820 --> 18:28.800
Yeah,you want divya shouldrough him up?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.760
No,I'm good.I'm going
over thereright now.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.560
- I got a plan.
- Plan?Plans are good.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.610
Contracts are better.You don't
have onewith him yet,do you?

18:34.610 --> 18:35.550
Well,I okay,you know what?

18:35.550 --> 18:38.530
This handshake hank thingis really
cute,but now I'm tagging alongwith you.

18:38.530 --> 18:40.600
- Fine.
- And,by the way,next time we havea staff meeting,

18:40.600 --> 18:44.140
we're gonna usethat multimedia
station,'cause I slaved overthat powerpoint

18:44.140 --> 18:47.170
and I also really wantto
use this laser pointer.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.240
Stop it.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.910
Getstop it!

18:59.990 --> 19:01.480
zack?

19:01.480 --> 19:05.360
Exam time.Come on down.

19:10.260 --> 19:14.130
Take a break,picasso.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.760
Zack?Step down,please.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.500
I'm okay.

19:30.980 --> 19:33.450
You stopped taking
yourcalcium channel blockers.

19:33.450 --> 19:36.000
They wore you out,so you
compensated with too many diuretics

19:36.000 --> 19:37.610
and now you're dehydratedand cramping.

19:37.610 --> 19:38.770
That's why you fell.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.730
I need a bananafor some potassium.

19:40.730 --> 19:43.310
Zack,we are waypast bananas and tea.

19:43.310 --> 19:45.920
All those diureticsmade you ototoxic.

19:45.920 --> 19:49.790
Temporarily deaf.You
can barelyhear me,right?

19:49.790 --> 19:51.670
Those blockersmake me feel like crap.

19:51.670 --> 19:55.550
I take them,I miss deadlines,and
eventually our publisher'sgonna drop us.

19:55.550 --> 19:58.810
I can't affordto play russian
roulette with our livelihood.

19:58.810 --> 20:01.570
Well,you're playing
russianroulette with your life.

20:01.570 --> 20:04.380
I got to make a living,hank.

20:04.380 --> 20:05.850
Look,I get it.I do.

20:05.850 --> 20:08.980
But if you don'ttake your meds,you
could developa severe arrhythmia.

20:08.980 --> 20:12.480
I'm your doctor.You
need to listen to me.

20:14.670 --> 20:16.480
What?

20:16.480 --> 20:19.920
You need to listen to me.

20:22.010 --> 20:24.460
Don't you guys havea triplea discount?

20:24.460 --> 20:26.670
Coupon in the paper?

20:26.670 --> 20:28.370
Twoforone special?Anything?

20:28.370 --> 20:33.290
We're here to keep yourhusband
alive,ma'am,not steam clean your carpets.

20:33.290 --> 20:35.480
Fine.

20:36.620 --> 20:40.140
Here's a check for half.

20:40.550 --> 20:42.690
I'll give you collateralfor the rest.

20:42.690 --> 20:44.030
What kind of collateral?

20:44.030 --> 20:48.530
Because I'd really rathernot
have to store any valuables,ma'am.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.010
All right.

20:53.010 --> 20:56.500
I don't even haveto ring a bell with a
sledgehammer or letyou guess my weight first.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.760
The book is a first edition.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.250
It's worth something.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.800
And be carefulwith the stuffed animals.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.420
Some of them were determinedto
be highly flammable.

21:05.420 --> 21:06.950
Kids weresetting these on fire?

21:06.950 --> 21:12.710
One kid.He was fine,but
his parents were lawyers.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.000
Okay.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.480
Forget the collateral.Just...

21:19.480 --> 21:23.140
indulge me by completinga survey,okay?

21:23.140 --> 21:28.870
On a scale of one to ten,how satisfied
are you with yourdecision to hire hankmed?

21:28.870 --> 21:30.930
I didn't want to hire
youin the first place.

21:30.930 --> 21:35.170
We tradedan entire cardiac ward
for a guy with a duffel bag.

21:35.170 --> 21:37.580
My husband belongsin the hospital.

21:37.580 --> 21:41.990
So can I say,like,9.5?

21:42.300 --> 21:44.800
I'll just say nine.

21:50.590 --> 21:52.310
I've been avoidingrachel all day.

21:52.310 --> 21:54.390
This allergy rusewon't last long.

21:54.390 --> 21:58.050
Then let's getthis diagnosed and
treated,so the two of youcan move on...

21:58.050 --> 22:01.160
if you'd let medo the exam now.

22:02.790 --> 22:07.430
The tests showedthat it's not a
urinary tract infectionor syphilis.

22:07.430 --> 22:09.200
Why'd you test for syphilis?

22:09.200 --> 22:11.570
I retired my player's
jerseywhen I met rachel.

22:11.570 --> 22:19.010
Although the wild storiesabout mutual fund software
entrepreneursare everything you've heard and then some.

22:19.010 --> 22:20.990
Wait.

22:20.990 --> 22:25.220
You thought my wifewas cheating
on me right before our wedding?

22:25.220 --> 22:26.540
Not necessarily.

22:26.540 --> 22:28.820
But given your restrictions,that's
all I could test for.

22:28.820 --> 22:30.550
She was on a threeweekphoto shoot.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.900
She flew in for the wedding.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.860
So we haven't been intimatefor a month.

22:33.860 --> 22:35.860
I certainly didn't
meanto cast aspersions.

22:35.860 --> 22:37.610
If you let me conducta quick exam ...

22:37.610 --> 22:41.180
so far your medical
huncheshaven't been that...

22:41.180 --> 22:42.460
"hunchy.

22:42.460 --> 22:43.840
" So what are yougonna check for now?

22:43.840 --> 22:46.300
Epididymitisor testicular orchitis.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.490
Uh,neither of thosesounds any good.

22:48.490 --> 22:50.780
I don't name them.I just treat them.

22:50.780 --> 22:53.400
Uh,hey,for the record...

22:53.400 --> 22:55.350
I don't have a problemwith
you being a woman.

22:55.350 --> 22:56.290
Good.

22:56.290 --> 22:57.400
Neither do I.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.880
My problem is you'rean assistant.

22:59.880 --> 23:04.860
Mr.Ryder,if you wouldworry less about
my title and focus moreon what I can do,

23:04.860 --> 23:08.350
hopefully I can get you
backon your honeymoon.

23:08.350 --> 23:10.840
Now...

23:11.100 --> 23:13.000
drop 'em.

23:22.870 --> 23:25.490
Yeah,just fax it.That's cool.

23:26.470 --> 23:28.800
Mrs.Kinglsey,we need to talk.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.220
Of course we do.

23:30.220 --> 23:32.810
And you can call ita
consultation and charge us for it.

23:32.810 --> 23:34.270
No,no,no.This isn't about the money.

23:34.270 --> 23:36.170
Evan,they can pay what
theywant,when they want.

23:36.170 --> 23:38.330
That's actually exactly what
iwas about to tell mrs.Kinglsey.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.280
But in exchange,I expect
thatsurvey to be filled out,okay?

23:41.280 --> 23:43.630
Optional commentsection included.

23:43.630 --> 23:45.360
I'll see you at home.

23:47.020 --> 23:52.580
So you've finally realizedyou bit off more than
you can chewwith my loving,stubbornashell husband.

23:52.580 --> 23:55.560
No,I realize that youand I want the
same thing and we can help each other.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.400
And how's that?

23:56.400 --> 24:01.130
By convincing zackthat he needs to be your
husband first and your illustrator second.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.300
Zack?

24:09.360 --> 24:10.630
He locked it again.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.930
He gets like this beforeevery deadline.

24:13.350 --> 24:14.710
Zack,open up,buddy.

24:14.770 --> 24:16.940
Even I don't get a key.

24:17.930 --> 24:20.750
The good news is the kitchenand the
bathrooms are all on this sideof the door,

24:20.750 --> 24:23.280
so eventually he hasto come out.

24:24.420 --> 24:26.880
Zack!Zack!

24:26.940 --> 24:29.090
Open the door,zack!

24:37.350 --> 24:38.500
What's happening?

24:38.510 --> 24:40.600
It's calleda flash pulmonary edema.

24:40.660 --> 24:42.430
This fluid's comingfrom his lungs.

24:42.530 --> 24:44.480
Uh,grab that bag,please.

24:48.450 --> 24:50.490
Oh,please.

24:52.130 --> 24:54.100
Don't leave me,sweetie.

24:54.470 --> 24:56.450
Please.

24:56.610 --> 24:58.250
I need you.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.600
It's gonna be okay.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.580
Stay with me,zack.

25:06.880 --> 25:12.910
Please.Please.Please.

25:17.780 --> 25:20.000
Just stay calm and breathe,zack.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.790
This is a bipap machine.

25:21.790 --> 25:23.390
There's fluidbacked up into your lungs.

25:23.450 --> 25:27.030
The bipap will helpyour oxygenation
and improve the functionof your heart.

25:27.060 --> 25:29.360
Julie,come here.Can you hold him?

25:29.500 --> 25:31.920
Keep him sitting upwhile
the machine does its work.

25:33.450 --> 25:35.680
You'll feel better soon.

25:35.810 --> 25:37.860
I have you,zack.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.800
I have you.

25:42.570 --> 25:44.550
I'm not putting a gown on.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.920
You wanted a look.I gave you a look.

25:45.990 --> 25:51.200
I eliminated epididymitisand orchitis,but
I did see a mildulceration down there.

25:51.240 --> 25:55.580
In order to diagnose it,I'll
need to examine your pulse,

25:55.610 --> 25:58.230
your temperature,your nose,your ears.

25:58.310 --> 26:00.320
I told you where it hurts.

26:00.430 --> 26:02.610
You're not even lookingon the right end.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.860
This is partof the diagnostic process.

26:04.920 --> 26:09.420
I need to doa full examination and get a
scrapingfrom the ulcer to put under a microscope.

26:09.490 --> 26:13.310
The software I inventedsold millions
because it gives peoplean answer.

26:13.430 --> 26:17.150
No offense,I just think a doctor would have
given me one by nowor at least had a theory.

26:17.150 --> 26:18.950
It could beany number of things.

26:18.950 --> 26:22.020
It would be irresponsibleto
speculate out loud at this point.

26:22.090 --> 26:24.060
"Any number of things"?

26:24.170 --> 26:27.600
Like what?Please,be irresponsible.

26:27.750 --> 26:32.150
Granuloma
inguinale,chancroid,balanitis,fungal infection,

26:32.180 --> 26:38.510
psychosomatic dermatitis,herpes
zoster,tuberculosis,hpv,squamous cell carcinoma.

26:38.580 --> 26:39.870
Carcinoma?

26:39.940 --> 26:41.380
On my honeymoon?

26:41.380 --> 26:45.450
On my that?

26:45.870 --> 26:48.040
Oh,god.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.300
I knew somethinghad to happen.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.210
Good.So those are zack's options.

26:55.260 --> 26:58.980
Yep.Do it my way,the right
way,or it's back to heritage.

26:59.110 --> 27:01.030
It sounds likea nolose situation for me.

27:01.030 --> 27:04.990
Either way,I get to
keepyou alive,zoomer.

27:05.180 --> 27:07.670
All right,fluid's
dissipated.How do you feel?

27:07.680 --> 27:10.260
Lucky,I guess.And cold.

27:10.390 --> 27:12.970
I'll go get your tea.

27:13.310 --> 27:15.250
All right,you ready for the blockers?

27:15.340 --> 27:17.110
Actually,first I'd like to
finish rhetorical question.

27:17.220 --> 27:21.400
Before you do anything else,I need to give
youthe medication that'll keep you alive.

27:21.430 --> 27:24.510
Look,the good news isthe iv catheter's
already in,so I just haveto switch bags.

27:24.580 --> 27:27.640
And the bad newsis now I'll be lame.

27:27.740 --> 27:29.470
Kids hate lame,hank.

27:29.570 --> 27:31.580
So you'd let your courseof
treatment be dictated

27:31.770 --> 27:34.300
by peoplewho are threefeet
tall and eat paste for fun?

27:34.350 --> 27:36.270
Why not?They dictatethe
course of my career.

27:36.390 --> 27:37.870
Don't give up on me.

27:37.920 --> 27:41.340
Get your health back,then you
can work ongetting your mojo back.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.860
Hey,maybe you could puta little
doctor character in one of your books.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.750
Hey,do I tell youhow
to practice medicine?

27:46.860 --> 27:49.110
Actually,that's exactlywhat
you've been doing.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.940
Yeah.

27:52.180 --> 27:53.970
Yeah.

27:54.650 --> 27:56.540
I'm just sayingI never heard of the job.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.940
So how could I knowif a socalled P.A.

27:59.080 --> 28:01.270
Knows a kidney stonefrom a kidney bean?

28:01.340 --> 28:05.180
Because she works for me,and we ask that
question on the hankmedjob application.

28:05.710 --> 28:07.140
You're the doctor?

28:07.230 --> 28:10.020
Great.Glad to finallyhave you involved.

28:10.070 --> 28:13.930
I've been involved.Divya's kept
me informedevery step of the way.

28:14.020 --> 28:19.100
Mr.Ryder,I am happyto check you out,but
you were in great hands before I got here.

28:19.270 --> 28:21.020
How far along were you?

28:21.060 --> 28:22.300
He wouldn't let me give hima full exam.

28:22.420 --> 28:24.350
I gave her a peek.

28:24.390 --> 28:26.000
I thought he didn'thave allergies.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.820
I don'T.I didn'T.

28:31.770 --> 28:34.730
Minor lesionsin the nasal membrane.

28:34.830 --> 28:37.120
In combination withthe other ulceration.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.900
I've seen this overseas.

28:39.020 --> 28:40.700
I don't go overseas.

28:43.450 --> 28:45.180
Were you inthe greenhouse much?

28:45.250 --> 28:46.370
Only for the wedding.

28:46.430 --> 28:49.420
Did you spendany additional time there?

28:49.500 --> 28:52.580
Not in your tuxedo perhaps?

28:53.040 --> 28:54.990
Well...

28:55.080 --> 28:56.570
yes.

28:56.690 --> 29:02.270
Rachel came to my doorthe morning of the wedding and
made me go skinnydippingwith her through the trees.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.150
I told her it wasbad
luck to see each other,

29:04.270 --> 29:07.510
but she can be very
persuasivewhen she's naked.

29:07.570 --> 29:11.330
I'm sure.I think when you
broughtthe tropics to you,

29:11.440 --> 29:14.620
you may have gottenmore
than you bargained for.

29:17.780 --> 29:23.440
- Divya,I'm gonna needa microscope and
- a giemsa stain.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.490
I think you have a caseof leishmaniasis.

29:25.590 --> 29:28.400
It's caused by the biteof
tropical sand flies.

29:28.500 --> 29:32.170
One of them probablyhitched
a ride to america on a tree.

29:32.170 --> 29:37.080
Then bit youupstairs and downstairs
while you rompedand frolicked.

29:37.180 --> 29:39.780
Luckily,it's treatable,and
you're gonna be okay.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.340
Thank god.

29:41.510 --> 29:44.610
I'll go tell my wifeshe still has
a honeymoon to look forward to.

30:17.070 --> 30:18.610
What are you doing here?

30:18.730 --> 30:20.910
My nephews are big fans.

30:21.100 --> 30:23.730
They're over there waitingfor
the reading to start.

30:23.940 --> 30:28.620
Can I ask,do you does this
cutoutlook funny to you?

30:28.690 --> 30:30.330
They're children's bookcharacters.

30:30.470 --> 30:34.530
Yeah,but not "ha ha" funny,like off.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.360
Looks likezoomer and jewel to me.

30:37.530 --> 30:39.570
Okay.

30:40.430 --> 30:43.200
Is that super stan weisman,the
cardiologistfrom manhattan?

30:43.360 --> 30:46.080
What's he doing here?

30:46.230 --> 30:49.490
Dr.Weisman has a housein
the hamptons,and he has kids.

30:49.610 --> 30:52.110
Oh,yeah.No,that makes sense.

30:52.350 --> 30:57.480
And I recruited himto work at hamptons
heritage two days a weekevery summer.

30:57.610 --> 30:59.650
That's quite a coup.

30:59.850 --> 31:02.880
I guess sometimesus
little people want it more.

31:02.890 --> 31:05.220
Okay,I see whatyou're doing there.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.820
Look,I shouldhave spoken to you
before agreeingto treat zack.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.410
I owed you that,and I am sorry.

31:10.500 --> 31:13.000
Yeah,well,he was leaving anyway.

31:13.120 --> 31:17.320
So apology acceptedand we're good?

31:18.460 --> 31:20.250
I don't thinkit's that simple.

31:20.350 --> 31:21.330
What do you mean?

31:21.330 --> 31:23.870
This is exactly what
happenedwith me and charlie.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.890
- Charlie.
- Yeah.Charlie,my ex.

31:26.930 --> 31:28.710
You know,once itstopped
working personally,

31:28.820 --> 31:30.760
we thought we could stillmake
it work professionally,

31:30.860 --> 31:35.370
but it turns out it's
reallyan allornothing deal.

31:35.490 --> 31:38.420
Anything in betweenis just too hard.

31:38.450 --> 31:40.800
So what are you saying?

31:40.840 --> 31:47.260
I want nothing morethan to see
you,hank,but I don't thinkI know how.

31:47.510 --> 31:50.710
I guess nothing's fair game.

31:51.460 --> 31:54.400
It's the only waythat I
can move on.I'mI'm sorry.

32:01.510 --> 32:02.290
Hello.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.560
Hank,come quick.Zack collapsed.

32:04.670 --> 32:06.960
He collapsed?

32:07.120 --> 32:08.970
The cutout.

32:08.990 --> 32:09.870
Jewel's all yellow.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.400
What?What does that mean?

32:11.480 --> 32:13.590
It means that zackis
toxic.I'm on my way.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.210
Stand back,ma'am.We've got it.

32:24.510 --> 32:27.480
We were on our way,and he
just bp's droppedto 60 over 30.

32:27.660 --> 32:29.020
Heart rate 150 per minute.

32:29.100 --> 32:30.330
I've got a line injust in case.

32:30.350 --> 32:31.380
Stop.I'm his doctor.

32:31.430 --> 32:33.820
He's afib with R.V.R.He
needs to be defibbed now.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.350
Yeah,that could kill him.He
has digitalis toxicity.

32:36.360 --> 32:37.730
What does that all mean?

32:37.800 --> 32:39.730
Julie,the teahe always drinks.Do
you have the box somewhere?

32:39.810 --> 32:41.430
There is no box.It's herbal.

32:41.580 --> 32:43.270
He grows it himselfin our garden.

32:43.380 --> 32:47.560
I'm betting that teawas foxglove.It grows wild
hereand it makes the digoxin,which slows downthe heart.

32:47.670 --> 32:48.620
He was selfmedicating.

32:48.660 --> 32:51.070
Look,state protocol mandates that
we stickto standard treatment.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.400
Yeah,well,we don't have time.I'll
take full responsibility.

32:53.500 --> 32:56.490
That's not my call,doc.It's hers.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.890
Julie,did you seethe cutouts he painted?

32:59.000 --> 32:59.630
- No.
- Okay.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.080
They showed signsthat
his vision had yellowed.

33:01.150 --> 33:03.300
That happens withexcessive digitalis.

33:03.430 --> 33:05.840
Look,I'm on your side,julie.

33:08.070 --> 33:09.340
Hank is his doctor.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.600
Okay,get my bag,please.

33:11.710 --> 33:13.680
I need youto flatten him out.

33:16.020 --> 33:17.310
Clear.

33:28.280 --> 33:30.990
With digitalis toxicity,you
push lidocaine,100 milligrams.

33:31.070 --> 33:32.630
Herbal teacan really do this?

33:32.720 --> 33:34.430
The kind zack drinks can.It's powerful.

33:34.530 --> 33:37.160
So with his heart
condition,overdosing is easy.

33:37.170 --> 33:38.430
Heart's still racingat 150.

33:38.570 --> 33:40.860
- Are you sure?
- Yes,it'll drop.

33:40.940 --> 33:42.830
Heart rate's really dropping.

33:42.910 --> 33:43.650
Too low,it's in the 30s.

33:43.810 --> 33:44.980
He could flatline.

33:45.020 --> 33:46.670
- How's his pressure?
- 100 over 50.

33:46.670 --> 33:50.640
Set upthe external pacemaker just in case his
pressuredrops too low before this kicks in.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.260
Welcome back,buddy.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.780
He's gonna be okay.

34:11.290 --> 34:15.610
So we'll give youiv pentavalent
antimony with allopurinol.

34:15.699 --> 34:18.630
And I'll cut backon my naked
frolicking in the elements too.

34:19.699 --> 34:21.510
You'll be all betterby month's end.

34:21.639 --> 34:24.380
This survey evan gave me.Two questions.

34:24.530 --> 34:26.620
Can I rate youhigher than a ten?

34:26.730 --> 34:33.130
And for "condition treated" it doesn't
seemto have a box for flies inside my fly.

34:33.310 --> 34:34.780
Just check "other".

34:34.889 --> 34:36.880
Check.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.610
I owe you a thanksand an apology.

34:39.670 --> 34:41.170
I was uncooperative.

34:41.230 --> 34:43.630
I put too much valueon
perception sometimes.

34:43.739 --> 34:49.230
But sometimes the best stocks
are the gemsnobody's heard of yet.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.760
Hi,baby.

34:52.310 --> 34:54.170
How's my super fly guy?

34:54.280 --> 34:56.510
The P.A.ThinksI'll be better by?

34:56.620 --> 34:59.130
Oh,right here.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.990
Oh,well,that's duringmy
trinidad photo shoot.

35:03.090 --> 35:08.050
What would you thinkif I met you in
trinidad and we flewto the real amazon?

35:08.060 --> 35:09.850
You'd really getin an airplane for me?

35:09.910 --> 35:11.610
With enough sedation,sure.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.500
Look,if something this
weirdcan happen in the hamptons,

35:14.550 --> 35:15.760
what am I so afraid of,huh?

35:15.950 --> 35:17.810
Oh,baby.

35:17.970 --> 35:19.460
Oh,my big,strong man.

35:19.590 --> 35:22.210
Oh,my gosh,I just love you
so much,my little rock star.

35:22.450 --> 35:24.520
Eskimo kisses.

35:24.670 --> 35:26.890
Okay,bye.Bye.

35:36.520 --> 35:40.240
"Watching the sunsetalways
made zoomer "a little sad,

35:40.560 --> 35:45.390
"because that meant bedtime
and all the day's funwas done.

35:45.450 --> 35:47.690
" "But every nightwhen
the lights went off,

35:47.750 --> 35:54.230
"jewel whispered to
him,'tomorrow isa brandnew day.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.960
'" "And it was.

36:12.010 --> 36:13.540
" Well,they thinkyou still got it.

36:13.620 --> 36:17.270
Oh,well,some daysI have the
mo,some days I have the jo.

36:17.380 --> 36:19.320
And some days,I even put them together.

36:19.680 --> 36:20.760
That sounds like progress.

36:20.900 --> 36:25.280
Nothing will make youstop bitching about
your life like gettinga second chance at it.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.270
And look,as I said,if
you want to find out

38:01.890 --> 38:06.780
Well,if it'scorticosteroids,they sometimeshave
the side effect of persistent hiccupping.

38:06.820 --> 38:09.310
Try these instead.

Hey,if you ever needany free A.V.Help
