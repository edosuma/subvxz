13:47.774 --> 13:48.776
Hello?

13:56.817 --> 13:58.419
<i>Is there anybody else?</i>

13:58.820 --> 13:59.720
Hey.

14:01.154 --> 14:02.590
<i>Is there anybody else?</i>

14:08.797 --> 14:10.231
There's nobody else.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.637
Why are you still alive?

14:19.206 --> 14:20.441
Why are you?

14:22.810 --> 14:23.946
Why do you have a gun?

14:25.979 --> 14:28.749
<i>Just found it on the road,
thought it might come in handy.</i>

14:29.117 --> 14:30.219
<i>For what?</i>

14:31.920 --> 14:35.324
Well, I mean, they could
reanimate all of a sudden.

14:37.292 --> 14:39.827
That's not gonna happen.

14:41.463 --> 14:42.764
Come on. I have to pee.

14:42.997 --> 14:45.934
- Just give... Give me a minute.
- <i>It's an emergency.</i>

14:47.268 --> 14:48.604
<i>Hold on.</i>

14:50.838 --> 14:52.207
Okay, I'll unlock the door.

14:52.340 --> 14:55.976
<i>You just... You have to count
backwards from 100.</i>

14:56.476 --> 14:58.012
<i>And then you can open the door.</i>

14:59.513 --> 15:00.414
Okay.

15:01.249 --> 15:03.685
<i>There's a car downstairs
waiting for you.</i>

15:05.486 --> 15:07.054
<i>You have to...
You have to go...</i>

15:07.455 --> 15:10.558
to wherever you were...
on your way to.

15:11.825 --> 15:13.561
- <i>Okay?</i>
- Yeah.

15:14.662 --> 15:15.696
Yes!

15:16.797 --> 15:18.299
- <i>One hundred...</i>
- No, don't start yet.

15:18.432 --> 15:20.033
- Ninety-nine.
- Hold on.

15:21.069 --> 15:24.604
I unlock the door and then you
start counting backwards from 100.

15:25.172 --> 15:26.907
<i>Step away from it, please.</i>

15:32.412 --> 15:33.882
<i>Unlock the door!</i>

15:39.754 --> 15:42.490
<i>One hundred, ninety-nine...</i>

15:50.898 --> 15:52.333
You sounded shorter.

15:55.970 --> 15:56.904
Hey!

15:58.672 --> 15:59.573
Wait!

16:04.311 --> 16:05.714
Where's the smell?

16:07.449 --> 16:09.317
- Where are all the bodies?
- I buried them.

16:09.450 --> 16:10.619
All of them?

16:14.922 --> 16:15.956
The keys.

16:28.103 --> 16:29.338
I wanna stay.

16:38.046 --> 16:42.551
So you're telling me you're just totally
fine with letting the human race go extinct?

16:48.989 --> 16:49.924
Good luck.

18:22.183 --> 18:24.753
Maybe I can help you
clear the rest of the bodies.

18:26.353 --> 18:28.222
You'd get it all done
a lot quicker

18:28.389 --> 18:29.756
if you had
an extra set of hands.

18:30.757 --> 18:34.261
Maybe we could expand to the next town,
then we could go to the town after that.

18:34.396 --> 18:35.797
There are no next towns.

19:30.918 --> 19:34.255
So, why do you think
it all happened?

19:36.590 --> 19:38.892
Everybody just dropping dead.

19:39.494 --> 19:40.695
It doesn't matter.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.907
It could've been the rapture.

19:55.443 --> 19:59.312
Or some...
neurodegenerative disease

19:59.780 --> 20:05.186
that only affects, like,
99.99 percent of the population.

20:11.559 --> 20:13.261
Are you using chopsticks?

20:28.007 --> 20:30.644
- Where were you when it happened?
- Sleeping.

20:30.779 --> 20:33.214
You were sleeping?
On a Tuesday afternoon?

20:33.347 --> 20:34.616
I worked nights.

20:35.815 --> 20:36.784
Where?

20:39.887 --> 20:41.923
- Right here.
- In the library?

20:44.058 --> 20:45.359
Weren't you lonely?

20:49.696 --> 20:51.431
Are you gonna keep asking me
questions all night?

20:52.132 --> 20:55.469
That's what people do;
they ask each other questions.

20:55.736 --> 20:56.870
You know what?

20:58.505 --> 20:59.706
I'll tell you
when I felt lonely.

21:00.241 --> 21:04.212
I felt lonely when it was me and
1,600 other people in this town.

21:06.213 --> 21:08.049
I was pretty fucking lonely.

21:13.587 --> 21:15.023
You have any more questions?

21:24.565 --> 21:26.233
- I'll get my stuff.
- Okay.

21:54.328 --> 21:55.263
Fuck!

21:57.997 --> 21:59.767
Stupid fuck!

22:03.670 --> 22:04.773
You scared me.

22:05.906 --> 22:07.175
Where are you headed?

22:10.177 --> 22:11.412
Niagara Falls.

22:12.513 --> 22:15.949
I'm... seeing all the landmarks.

22:19.419 --> 22:20.688
And after that?

22:25.560 --> 22:26.895
Just Niagara Falls.

22:38.839 --> 22:40.140
Why are you here?

22:43.578 --> 22:47.449
I thought about it, and worried if I
changed my mind you'd be long gone.

22:50.184 --> 22:53.087
Maybe we could have some sort of
trial period. I don't know.

22:53.286 --> 22:54.221
We can't just...

22:55.455 --> 22:56.357
Whoa...

22:58.492 --> 22:59.461
What's your name?

23:00.494 --> 23:01.396
I'm Del.

23:02.228 --> 23:03.465
- I'm Grace.
- Okay.

25:10.456 --> 25:11.892
Why are you here?

25:14.829 --> 25:17.898
Uh, there wasn't, um... Well, it
didn't have an X on the curb, so...

25:18.032 --> 25:20.435
Well, I haven't cleaned
this part of town yet.

25:26.639 --> 25:27.609
Who is she?

25:29.208 --> 25:30.311
Mrs. Young.

25:36.751 --> 25:38.953
All right. Let's do it.

25:39.086 --> 25:40.488
- Do what?
- Let's clean.

25:40.821 --> 25:44.125
I clean the houses. I have
a very specific way of doing it.

25:47.261 --> 25:48.196
Teach me.

25:54.834 --> 25:56.270
Just this one house.

26:01.841 --> 26:03.477
I don't know
what the fuck that is.

26:05.812 --> 26:06.746
Batteries.

26:07.446 --> 26:10.417
Single most important commodity
the dead have to offer.

26:11.319 --> 26:14.355
The necrophiliac in me
would have to disagree with you.

26:17.190 --> 26:20.093
You might wanna... put this on.

26:23.965 --> 26:25.366
- What are you doing?
- I'm cleaning.

26:25.500 --> 26:28.102
Why? It's not like anyone's
gonna come in here again.

26:28.436 --> 26:31.371
Entropy is the idea
that there's chaos...

26:31.505 --> 26:34.309
Yeah, it's a chaos thing,
I know.

26:35.576 --> 26:37.444
With every piece of trash
we pick up,

26:37.644 --> 26:40.580
there's one less case
for chaos in the universe.

26:44.349 --> 26:45.954
Has anyone ever told you
you're kind of a weird guy?

26:48.054 --> 26:50.057
Yeah. But they're all dead now.

27:01.334 --> 27:03.236
What are you looking for?

27:04.871 --> 27:06.706
You know who Tolstoy is?

27:07.407 --> 27:10.645
- I fucking know who Tolstoy is.
- <i>War and Peace.</i>

27:15.148 --> 27:18.719
Mrs. Young owed 700-dollars
worth of late fees.

27:23.523 --> 27:24.523
Found it!

27:24.725 --> 27:26.660
- You what?
- I found it.

27:41.041 --> 27:42.777
She stretched the leather.

28:23.050 --> 28:23.951
Wait.

28:24.551 --> 28:27.187
- Aren't you gonna say something?
- Why?

28:30.690 --> 28:32.092
She was a person.

28:34.962 --> 28:38.599
Uh... Did you say something
for everybody that you saw?

28:40.234 --> 28:41.802
- No.
- Exactly.

28:44.304 --> 28:45.639
I held my breath.

28:45.773 --> 28:46.840
I'm sorry. What?

28:47.940 --> 28:49.409
Every time I saw one,

28:50.144 --> 28:52.279
I would hold my breath
for ten seconds.

28:52.980 --> 28:54.682
It's just something stupid
I did.

29:06.459 --> 29:07.360
Okay.

29:58.646 --> 30:00.848
We should make
chicken wings.

30:01.747 --> 30:03.417
Too bad we can't!

30:06.219 --> 30:07.586
Chicken wings with ranch.

30:08.455 --> 30:11.625
God, I miss ranch.

30:12.225 --> 30:14.695
I could put it in
a cheeseburger, pizza...

30:15.529 --> 30:16.564
a sandwich.

30:17.964 --> 30:19.200
It was so good.

30:20.065 --> 30:21.501
These are expired.

30:23.971 --> 30:25.506
Fuck it.

30:25.705 --> 30:27.942
There's so many things
that are gone.

30:28.175 --> 30:30.578
Pepperoni pizza dipped in ranch.

30:34.415 --> 30:36.716
We can have
some strawberry pie filling.

30:38.651 --> 30:39.586
It's still good.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.523
What do you miss the most?

30:46.493 --> 30:47.359
Quiet.

30:47.593 --> 30:49.462
- What?
- Nothing.

30:54.201 --> 30:55.303
Fuck.

30:56.704 --> 30:59.573
- Clean up on aisle five!
- Can you pick that up, please?

31:37.711 --> 31:38.646
Del!

31:42.850 --> 31:43.984
Del!

32:07.541 --> 32:08.442
Hello?

35:32.112 --> 35:34.181
Fuck.

37:02.536 --> 37:03.604
Come on!

37:03.869 --> 37:07.007
- Welcome to the dog pound, Del.
- What are you doing?

37:07.806 --> 37:09.842
Here.

37:10.076 --> 37:12.946
Can you believe she survived?
Good girl, good girl.

37:13.179 --> 37:15.182
Here. Come here, girl.

37:16.583 --> 37:19.153
All right. I'm allergic.

37:19.853 --> 37:22.289
Hey.

37:23.723 --> 37:25.793
Hey!

37:29.094 --> 37:30.863
Good girl, good girl.

37:31.732 --> 37:33.333
Hey!

37:40.206 --> 37:41.275
Aw!

37:42.342 --> 37:44.912
- What should we name her?
- Bruce.

37:45.311 --> 37:46.246
Hey.

37:50.516 --> 37:52.985
Dewey?
Like the decimal system.

37:53.118 --> 37:54.020
Nah...

37:54.920 --> 37:55.955
I get it.

37:59.092 --> 38:00.094
Balzac.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.027
Ball-sack!

38:02.529 --> 38:04.098
But she doesn't have
a ball sack.

38:04.831 --> 38:05.866
Have some more wine.

38:06.232 --> 38:08.735
- That's a real name, you know.
- No, it's not.

38:09.201 --> 38:10.203
Dog!

38:11.103 --> 38:12.038
Dog!

38:13.406 --> 38:15.642
Hey! Hi!

38:16.375 --> 38:17.844
Hi, good girl.

39:35.121 --> 39:36.757
I had a goldfish once.

39:37.757 --> 39:40.226
A goldfish!
It lived for two years.

39:42.929 --> 39:45.331
That's a really long time for
a goldfish to live, you know.

39:46.065 --> 39:48.601
Goldfish can actually live up to
about 25 years.

39:48.935 --> 39:51.103
Twenty-five years? No.

39:51.538 --> 39:55.340
- So? It's not really that long.
- That is not true!

39:55.808 --> 39:57.076
That's not true.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.612
Goldfish, they live,
like, a week.

39:59.913 --> 40:01.081
They live, like, a day.

40:01.281 --> 40:03.449
They die, like, the next day.
That's their thing.

40:03.616 --> 40:04.884
That's their thing that they do.

40:05.085 --> 40:06.485
If you don't take care of them,
they die.

40:06.619 --> 40:09.455
Well, mine lived for two years,
which is a long time.

40:09.589 --> 40:11.924
- Not really.
- Oh, my God.

40:14.927 --> 40:17.364
Maybe you were a chef
in your past life.

40:47.860 --> 40:49.196
Let's go.

41:03.375 --> 41:05.244
- Grace.
- Dog!

41:08.047 --> 41:09.215
Dog?

41:09.549 --> 41:11.552
Shit!

41:12.152 --> 41:13.519
No! Stop!

41:13.652 --> 41:15.855
Shit, shit, shit. Oh, God.

41:21.893 --> 41:23.096
What is that?

41:24.264 --> 41:25.165
Sorry.

41:26.266 --> 41:28.768
Why don't you stay and clean
this up, I'll take the dog out.

41:28.935 --> 41:30.469
Give me the dog.
Give me, give me...

41:30.603 --> 41:31.803
Ow!

41:31.938 --> 41:34.541
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

41:35.442 --> 41:37.010
Ugh...

41:53.359 --> 41:54.293
Here.

41:57.462 --> 41:58.431
Let me see.

42:09.109 --> 42:10.310
Just hold still.

42:34.734 --> 42:35.668
Thank you.

43:22.014 --> 43:23.116
Del.

43:23.717 --> 43:26.086
Del! The dog's gone.

43:26.953 --> 43:29.389
- What?
- The dog is gone.

43:37.563 --> 43:38.632
Dog?

43:41.433 --> 43:42.401
Dog?

43:45.739 --> 43:46.639
Wait...

43:47.706 --> 43:49.241
I thought I tied her up.

43:51.610 --> 43:53.212
I just don't understand.

44:01.087 --> 44:03.389
- I... I let it out.
- What?

44:05.157 --> 44:06.426
It had to pee.

44:10.330 --> 44:13.100
She's a dog.
She's gotta pee, right?

44:18.938 --> 44:20.040
Come on.

44:22.708 --> 44:23.744
We'll find her.

45:37.616 --> 45:39.385
Okay. What are you doing
with those?

45:41.821 --> 45:43.589
You don't know any of them.

45:45.324 --> 45:47.094
They're just objects to you.

46:06.011 --> 46:07.613
My dad was a pastor.

46:10.382 --> 46:13.552
People travelled for miles
just to see him talk.

46:17.022 --> 46:18.725
And he died on the toilet.

46:27.967 --> 46:29.802
My mom died on the elliptical.

46:57.663 --> 47:00.467
Do you wanna know what I was
doing when it happened?

47:04.002 --> 47:05.371
I was with a boy.

47:10.576 --> 47:13.746
I think... I think you've had...
too much to drink.

47:20.252 --> 47:22.755
You had no one.

47:26.257 --> 47:28.794
I had everyone.

49:24.009 --> 49:25.411
What are you doing?

49:38.223 --> 49:39.692
Let me show you something.

50:08.855 --> 50:13.426
There are a lot of houses in town that still
need clearing. I could... I could use the help.

50:14.460 --> 50:16.830
Don't feel obligated.
Only if you want to.

50:26.172 --> 50:27.874
Don't forget to water them.

51:21.627 --> 51:23.862
So a vampire walks into a bar,

51:24.630 --> 51:28.368
and he asks the bartender:
"Can I have a cup of hot water?"

51:29.302 --> 51:32.204
And so, the bartender then
gives him a cup of hot water.

51:33.205 --> 51:36.976
And then, the vampire pulls out
a used tampon and says:

51:37.109 --> 51:38.511
"It's tea time!"

51:39.444 --> 51:40.611
Isn't that gross?

51:44.482 --> 51:46.218
Why didn't we just do this
before?

52:02.634 --> 52:04.571
<i>Del!</i>

52:05.438 --> 52:06.539
<i>Del!</i>

52:07.038 --> 52:07.973
What?

52:09.040 --> 52:09.975
<i>It's Grace.</i>

52:14.212 --> 52:15.180
<i>Del!</i>

52:17.183 --> 52:18.083
Yes?

52:19.319 --> 52:20.253
<i>Hey.</i>

52:21.786 --> 52:23.889
<i>Now, we can always find
each other.</i>

53:31.824 --> 53:33.760
Del, I found a house.

55:00.545 --> 55:02.447
What are you...
What are you doing here?

55:02.581 --> 55:04.350
This house wasn't on the map.

55:05.616 --> 55:06.618
I called you on the...

55:06.752 --> 55:08.186
You're not supposed to be here.

55:09.855 --> 55:10.790
Why?

55:24.502 --> 55:26.004
Is this your house?

55:33.244 --> 55:36.049
- We can clean it like the others.
- No, not this one.

55:40.853 --> 55:42.855
You were never supposed
to be here.

55:44.456 --> 55:46.225
It was just supposed to be me.

55:57.469 --> 55:59.003
First thing I saw was the...

55:59.772 --> 56:01.440
playground behind the school.

56:10.949 --> 56:12.784
They were out for recess.

56:23.462 --> 56:24.797
All right.

56:26.397 --> 56:27.432
Let's clean.

57:12.645 --> 57:13.813
Hold on.

58:33.659 --> 58:35.094
I have to tell you something.

58:38.330 --> 58:39.465
What is it?

58:44.270 --> 58:46.205
It's about where I came from.

58:59.317 --> 59:01.520
Whatever it is,
you can tell me.

01:00:39.817 --> 01:00:43.522
<i>Right.</i>

01:01:08.947 --> 01:01:10.282
Oh!

01:01:13.118 --> 01:01:14.920
- Hello.
- Oh, hi!

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:18.723
- Um, Grace?
- Geez, uh...

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:22.194
- Hello.
- I'm Patrick, and this is my wife, Violet.

01:01:22.761 --> 01:01:26.131
- Breakfast?
- Come on, we got pancakes, we got syrup.

01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:32.170
Yeah,
let's set you a place. Come on.

01:01:33.938 --> 01:01:35.174
Well...

01:01:35.507 --> 01:01:38.409
Grace didn't tell us
that she had company.

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:41.446
You can just sit here.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.149
Please.

01:01:48.654 --> 01:01:49.789
All right.

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.429
What do they call you?

01:02:00.732 --> 01:02:02.634
- What?
- What's your name?

01:02:04.869 --> 01:02:05.770
Del.

01:02:07.906 --> 01:02:11.176
Huh! Is that short for something,
like Delroy or something?

01:02:11.308 --> 01:02:13.478
- No, just Del.
- Oh, okay.

01:02:15.147 --> 01:02:17.516
- This is a lovely town, Del.
- Mm.

01:02:18.116 --> 01:02:19.551
And your bodies?

01:02:21.018 --> 01:02:23.388
- Sorry?
- Your bodies?

01:02:23.721 --> 01:02:25.122
Oh, I buried them.

01:02:25.322 --> 01:02:28.060
Oh, okay. That's nice.

01:02:28.393 --> 01:02:31.729
Yeah. That must have been
a real operation.

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:33.866
How'd you manage that?

01:02:41.973 --> 01:02:43.875
Well, Del, uh...

01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:46.479
Tell me,
how'd you meet my daughter?

01:02:47.846 --> 01:02:49.380
- Daughter...
- Excuse me.

01:02:49.748 --> 01:02:50.749
Sit down.

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:54.118
He seems confused.

01:02:54.853 --> 01:02:59.191
You didn't want to tell this fella
about your parents back home?

01:02:59.891 --> 01:03:01.292
What, are you embarrassed?

01:03:02.393 --> 01:03:04.496
Come on, Grace. Come on.

01:03:07.031 --> 01:03:08.399
Tell him, Grace.

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.442
They're my parents.

01:03:25.482 --> 01:03:28.185
Grace, why don't you go
pack your stuff?

01:03:28.319 --> 01:03:29.587
We have a long ride ahead.

01:03:29.721 --> 01:03:32.391
Your father has his club
tournament on Sunday.

01:03:32.523 --> 01:03:34.527
Yeah. I play golf, Del.

01:03:35.927 --> 01:03:36.895
Mm.

01:03:37.261 --> 01:03:38.897
We got a heck of a league
back in Palm Springs.

01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:40.565
You should see
some of these guys.

01:03:41.132 --> 01:03:42.433
What guys?

01:03:47.072 --> 01:03:48.474
What do you mean, "What guys?"

01:03:48.806 --> 01:03:51.042
- What guys?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

01:03:51.176 --> 01:03:52.710
Well, you're gonna hold it.

01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:55.714
- What...? Others?
- He doesn't know.

01:03:56.348 --> 01:03:58.083
You stayed here all the time?

01:03:58.217 --> 01:04:00.719
You didn't go out to see
if there were other survivors?

01:04:00.853 --> 01:04:02.186
Nothing? Oh, my God!

01:04:02.319 --> 01:04:03.821
Stop!

01:04:03.956 --> 01:04:06.058
Well, I mean, you can't
make that kind of stuff up.

01:04:06.692 --> 01:04:08.060
I don't...
I don't get it, Grace.

01:04:08.192 --> 01:04:11.196
What, did you... just let this
poor guy think that he was what?

01:04:11.328 --> 01:04:12.930
The last man left on Earth?

01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:14.665
- How many?
- Hundreds.

01:04:14.799 --> 01:04:17.535
- Yeah, thousands. Right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:17.668 --> 01:04:20.038
I mean, we got signs up
on every highway in the country.

01:04:20.172 --> 01:04:22.374
Violet designed them.

01:04:22.708 --> 01:04:24.810
- She's a graphic artist.
- Long time ago.

01:04:26.043 --> 01:04:27.712
- I miss that.
- Yeah.

01:04:27.846 --> 01:04:29.514
Let's not dwell on the past.

01:04:30.081 --> 01:04:32.516
- Think about the future. Right?
- Mm.

01:04:32.984 --> 01:04:33.953
Right?

01:04:35.119 --> 01:04:37.288
Right.
That's what's important.

01:04:37.422 --> 01:04:39.692
Okay, you all have to leave now.

01:04:43.527 --> 01:04:45.863
I'm gonna keep chasing
this kid everywhere?

01:04:46.598 --> 01:04:49.567
- Why don't you clean up, okay?
- Mm-hm.

01:04:50.067 --> 01:04:52.270
Don't listen to them. Del!

01:04:52.636 --> 01:04:54.505
They're not good people.
They're fucking crazy.

01:04:54.639 --> 01:04:56.541
- Are those your parents?
- No.

01:04:56.674 --> 01:04:59.043
No! You have to listen to me.

01:04:59.177 --> 01:05:02.113
When I got to California...
Del, listen!

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:05.550
When I got to California, they paired
me with them. I didn't have a choice.

01:05:05.683 --> 01:05:08.185
You said it was just us. That is
the first thing you said to me.

01:05:08.319 --> 01:05:10.956
Well, I had to! 'Cause you wouldn't
have let me stay if I didn't do that.

01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:14.893
I was on the road for months! I was alone!
And you were the first person I saw!

01:05:15.027 --> 01:05:16.195
- It's my fault.
- Del, no!

01:05:16.328 --> 01:05:17.529
Grace!

01:05:17.661 --> 01:05:19.430
- No, no! Stop!
- Get your stuff packed up.

01:05:19.565 --> 01:05:20.898
Ready to hit the road.
Let's go.

01:05:21.031 --> 01:05:23.034
- Let go of the wheel, Grace.
- Take me with you!

01:05:23.168 --> 01:05:24.503
Take your fucking hand
off the wheel!

01:05:24.636 --> 01:05:26.170
Let go of the fucking wheel!

01:05:26.371 --> 01:05:29.308
I feel so sad for you!

01:06:15.786 --> 01:06:16.989
You told him?

01:06:18.022 --> 01:06:19.390
I was worried.

01:06:22.127 --> 01:06:24.830
It's time for you to
come back home.

01:06:25.864 --> 01:06:26.999
It's time.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.403
I don't think I can do this
alone.

01:06:37.475 --> 01:06:39.110
Please come back.

01:06:40.545 --> 01:06:43.514
Please. We'll make it right
this time.

01:06:43.714 --> 01:06:46.884
We have to be a real family.

01:06:59.598 --> 01:07:03.034
Come on. I'll pack for you.
Sit here.

01:07:03.967 --> 01:07:05.870
This is... all yours?

01:07:07.072 --> 01:07:08.940
And that's yours too.

01:07:09.574 --> 01:07:11.377
Am I forgetting anything?

01:07:26.058 --> 01:07:27.426
You got a sec?

01:07:31.295 --> 01:07:32.364
Very busy.

01:07:32.996 --> 01:07:35.433
Hey, I'm just gonna snag
an audiobook or two for the ride.

01:07:38.804 --> 01:07:42.441
Oh, well, just give me <i>Tuesdays
with Morrie</i> for all I care.

01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:49.114
I see...

01:07:52.951 --> 01:07:55.454
I see... No, I get it.

01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:06.632
Mm...

01:08:12.804 --> 01:08:14.807
You ever get sad sometimes?

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:17.109
No.

01:08:18.477 --> 01:08:20.479
I don't know,
I just feel like...

01:08:20.978 --> 01:08:25.149
you of all people might understand
what I'm going through.

01:08:28.419 --> 01:08:31.188
Look at you,
and your setup here.

01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:33.559
I see a guy
who's got it figured out.

01:08:41.566 --> 01:08:43.502
We all do what we have to.

01:08:45.069 --> 01:08:46.103
Right.

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.206
Hey, that's exactly right.

01:08:51.042 --> 01:08:54.011
Don't you wish everybody could
see things as simply as you do?

01:08:55.212 --> 01:08:56.715
Here, everybody does.

01:08:59.651 --> 01:09:01.420
Oh, I see.

01:09:01.553 --> 01:09:03.087
'Cause it's just you.

01:09:06.256 --> 01:09:07.859
'Cause it's just you, right?

01:09:09.194 --> 01:09:10.127
I get it.

01:09:11.495 --> 01:09:14.732
Yeah, that's good.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.269
No, that's really good.

01:09:24.008 --> 01:09:27.513
You know, we could really use a guy
like you back in the West Coast.

01:09:29.313 --> 01:09:31.782
Yeah. I'll tell you.

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:36.988
Having a guy with your
capacities, it'd be a real get.

01:09:41.692 --> 01:09:45.830
What if I were to tell you that
we've got a team of doctors,

01:09:46.497 --> 01:09:47.964
the best on the planet,

01:09:49.133 --> 01:09:53.237
coming up with new ways to harness
the complexities of the human mind?

01:09:54.504 --> 01:09:55.873
I'd like you to leave.

01:09:56.007 --> 01:09:59.177
I am talking some seriously
cutting-edge stuff here.

01:10:14.225 --> 01:10:15.994
Well, all right.

01:10:19.697 --> 01:10:22.767
Just in case you happen
to change your mind.

01:10:23.735 --> 01:10:26.672
'Cause we all gotta join
the fold at some point.

01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:35.246
It gets pretty darn cold
this far up north.

01:14:36.754 --> 01:14:39.456
<i>Must have been something
like those Wuthering Heights.</i>

01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:43.594
<i>You know, the kind of a house that looks
like you can hunt quail in the hallways.</i>

01:14:44.195 --> 01:14:46.998
<i>I didn't know it then,
but I was gonna be the quail.</i>

01:14:55.205 --> 01:14:57.575
<i>Well, maybe this is
a beautiful...</i>

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:14.860
<i>My mind is all mixed up.</i>

01:15:17.895 --> 01:15:20.397
<i>What seeks to destroy
civilization...</i>

01:15:25.469 --> 01:15:27.806
<i>You know, there was something
about the way she looked at me...</i>

01:15:48.191 --> 01:15:51.096
The Conways, 41, Crescent.

01:15:54.731 --> 01:15:56.935
Karl was a... lawyer.

01:15:59.270 --> 01:16:01.172
Terry taught the 3rd-graders,

01:16:01.873 --> 01:16:04.308
and Angela,
she loved graphic novels.

01:16:12.016 --> 01:16:13.317
Karen Millikan.

01:16:18.822 --> 01:16:20.392
Books would always
come back with...

01:16:20.926 --> 01:16:23.294
little pieces of
sand in the creases.

01:16:27.898 --> 01:16:29.633
Mm, it's Fred Cavanagh.

01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:32.704
Mailman.

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:39.176
He was a nice guy.

01:22:05.535 --> 01:22:07.404
What's going on?

01:22:11.609 --> 01:22:12.576
Nothing.

01:22:15.045 --> 01:22:16.513
I'll go check on her.

01:22:17.615 --> 01:22:20.884
Uh, check that sensor
on her right temple. Okay?

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:22.753
Yeah, it keeps coming loose.

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.442
Hey, Grace.

01:24:41.892 --> 01:24:42.927
Grace.

01:25:09.285 --> 01:25:10.887
Did Del come back?

01:25:25.401 --> 01:25:27.103
I'm sorry.

01:25:27.771 --> 01:25:29.240
So sorry.

01:26:26.829 --> 01:26:29.799
Oh, now, is that... Del?

01:26:32.770 --> 01:26:36.072
Hey, man, good to see you.
Um...

01:26:36.874 --> 01:26:38.809
Grace actually
should be resting.

01:26:40.509 --> 01:26:41.844
What's wrong with you?

01:26:42.044 --> 01:26:43.614
You put her back
in the fucking bed.

01:26:43.746 --> 01:26:47.017
And then, you and me, we...
we're gonna have a good talk.

01:26:53.523 --> 01:26:55.793
What...
What were you doing to her?

01:26:59.329 --> 01:27:00.531
Okay, uh...

01:27:00.664 --> 01:27:03.601
all of the negative feelings
that everybody has,

01:27:03.801 --> 01:27:07.304
they just... wipe 'em off
the spectrum entirely.

01:27:08.804 --> 01:27:09.505
Yeah.

01:27:10.206 --> 01:27:14.044
All the... grief and sadness.
And, uh...

01:27:14.311 --> 01:27:16.179
...anger, despair, guilt.

01:27:16.545 --> 01:27:19.215
These people shouldn't have
to live with that shit, right?

01:27:20.517 --> 01:27:22.253
It's not fair. Right?

01:27:22.386 --> 01:27:23.955
So we're doing something
about it.

01:27:26.522 --> 01:27:28.959
You keep your town
nice and clean.

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:33.263
It's great. And we do that
with our people.

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:39.870
They don't have to remember
what happened before.

01:27:40.804 --> 01:27:43.807
They don't have to live
in the past.

01:27:45.575 --> 01:27:47.345
There's no before.

01:27:50.681 --> 01:27:52.817
There's only from now on.

01:27:57.521 --> 01:27:58.655
Isn't that beautiful?

01:27:58.922 --> 01:28:01.657
To not have to remember
anything?

01:28:46.770 --> 01:28:48.304
I had a daughter.

01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:55.445

01:29:06.824 --> 01:29:09.393

01:31:44.481 --> 01:31:45.549

01:32:13.810 --> 01:32:15.478

01:32:32.361 --> 01:32:33.329
No.

01:32:36.667 --> 01:32:37.968
Is that okay?
