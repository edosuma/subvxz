WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:03.011
In the criminal
justice system...

00:03.086 --> 00:04.678
sexually based offenses

00:04.750 --> 00:06.376
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.447 --> 00:08.618
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.686 --> 00:10.313
who investigate
these vicious felonies...

00:10.383 --> 00:12.107
are members of an elite squad

00:12.175 --> 00:13.931
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.999 --> 00:15.886
These are their stories.

00:17.072 --> 00:19.374
I wish you'd stop dragging
me to these awful plays.

00:19.439 --> 00:22.789
It was nominated for a Tony.
Yeah. Now I know why it didn't win.

00:22.864 --> 00:25.963
I don't complain when you make me watch
those damn cooking shows with you...

00:26.033 --> 00:28.367
Well, why should you?
They don't cost $75 a ticket.

00:28.433 --> 00:29.894
Don't start with that...

00:29.970 --> 00:31.017
Quentin! Honey!

00:32.560 --> 00:34.022
Watch where
you're going!

00:34.097 --> 00:35.853
Drunken fool!
You stupid bastard!

00:35.922 --> 00:38.410
Honey, are you all right?
I'm okay.

00:38.577 --> 00:41.099
Quentin!
What? What is it?

00:41.202 --> 00:42.926
Look at your coat.

00:44.372 --> 00:46.161
You smell something?

00:47.956 --> 00:49.547
Oh, my God.

00:56.563 --> 00:59.466
It's the perp's coat. Dumped it in
the garbage can around the corner.

00:59.539 --> 01:00.587
There's blood all over it.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.601
Make my night, tell me
you found the victim's I.D.

01:02.675 --> 01:03.691
Sorry.
Either it's toast or...

01:03.764 --> 01:06.220
the fire department washed it
away with the rest of our evidence.

01:06.293 --> 01:09.740
About all I saw was his hood and his
beard. And what he did to my husband.

01:09.812 --> 01:12.115
We're gonna need your coat
for evidence, Mr. Lindberg.

01:12.181 --> 01:13.391
I'm due for
a new one anyway.

01:13.462 --> 01:15.764
We'll have you work with a
sketch artist. Give me a minute?

01:15.830 --> 01:17.107
No I.D.
on the victim.

01:17.174 --> 01:19.694
One of the precinct cops recognized
her as a hooker who works...

01:19.767 --> 01:20.814
9th and 10th Avenue.

01:20.887 --> 01:22.893
My guess is she picked
up the wrong john.

01:22.966 --> 01:25.716
Molloy. You Special Victims?
Yeah. Benson and Stabler.

01:25.781 --> 01:28.335
Your perp piled a mound of
garbage on the victim, lit it up.

01:28.406 --> 01:30.032
How much damage?
Her back is charred.

01:30.104 --> 01:32.045
If our house wasn't
right around the corner...

01:32.119 --> 01:33.395
she'd be well done,
both sides.

01:33.462 --> 01:34.477
Thanks, Cap.

01:34.551 --> 01:37.967
Her genitals are mutilated, fluids
present. Definitely one for you.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.502
What else?

01:39.575 --> 01:43.122
Full thickness burns to 50%
of her body, all post mortem.

01:43.449 --> 01:44.976
How can you tell?

01:45.113 --> 01:46.488
He slit her throat
to the spine...

01:46.552 --> 01:48.441
and filleted her torso
from neck to genitals.

01:48.505 --> 01:50.196
No way
she survived that.

01:50.394 --> 01:52.882
Butchered.
And barbecued.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074

02:40.063 --> 02:42.431
About 10:30,
guy comes down the block...

02:42.496 --> 02:44.351
bouncing off garbage cans
like he's a pinball.

02:44.416 --> 02:46.522
You see where he bounced to
after he dropped his coat?

02:46.592 --> 02:48.664
Right into my cart.
Nearly knocked it over.

02:48.737 --> 02:51.585
He starts preaching to me, I
say, "Tell your story walking."

02:51.650 --> 02:52.664
What was he preaching?

02:52.737 --> 02:54.777
I don't know. Some kind
of religious gibberish.

02:54.850 --> 02:57.153
Once he was done with his
sermon, you see where he went?

02:57.218 --> 03:00.382
He staggered to a cab parked on the
corner, got in. Cab headed downtown.

03:00.450 --> 03:01.825
You ever
seen him before?

03:01.890 --> 03:04.257
No, but his hooker's
a regular around here.

03:04.322 --> 03:07.454
Cassie. Picked him up coming
out of that souvenir place.

03:07.522 --> 03:09.432
Headed toward the alley
to do their business.

03:09.506 --> 03:12.573
Okay. The cab he got into,
you catch the plate?

03:12.676 --> 03:16.025
Only that it had a Y or
a V. I'll be right back.

03:16.484 --> 03:18.786
Boss says you may need some help. Yeah.

03:18.885 --> 03:22.497
Peanut man puts our perp outside that
souvenir shop, walks away with the victim.

03:22.566 --> 03:24.508
We'll start there and work
our way down the block.

03:24.581 --> 03:25.530
Thanks.

03:26.310 --> 03:30.053
Yeah, weird guy with a beard. Asked
for a bottle of water, so I send...

03:30.119 --> 03:33.052
him to the deli. Then he spots
my adult entertainment section.

03:33.126 --> 03:36.224
What'd he do? Picks up a
magazine, looks it over...

03:36.293 --> 03:39.109
and then rips it up. Then he
starts screaming about hell...

03:39.174 --> 03:42.469
and flames and how he's gonna smite
me. Must have been drunk or high.

03:42.536 --> 03:45.667
So I wave this at the wacko and say
that I'm gonna smite his sorry ass...

03:45.736 --> 03:48.519
up and down 9th Avenue. Did he
take his sorry ass out of here?

03:48.583 --> 03:51.399
He reaches for something in his
coat. I smack him a few times with...

03:51.464 --> 03:54.814
Lady Liberty here, he runs out
that door whimpering like a bitch.

03:54.986 --> 03:58.335
We're gonna need the magazine
and the statue for DNA and prints.

03:58.793 --> 04:02.143
That's $30 plus tax.
Send the bill to the Mayor.

04:03.239 --> 04:05.313
Victim's I.D.'d as
Cassie Horner, 23...

04:05.385 --> 04:07.327
busted numerous times
for prostitution.

04:07.402 --> 04:10.468
Anything more on the perp?
White, dark coat, about six feet.

04:10.538 --> 04:12.611
Witness descriptions have
him under the influence.

04:12.681 --> 04:14.853
That level of violence,
sounds like PCP.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.863
What about the car that
almost ran him over?

04:16.938 --> 04:18.564
Could have saved us
a lot of trouble.

04:18.635 --> 04:20.161
Took off.
Nobody got his plate number.

04:20.236 --> 04:22.439
That leaves four people who
got a good look at our perp.

04:22.508 --> 04:25.574
Plus all the working girls who
saw Cassie pick this guy up.

04:25.644 --> 04:26.725
What about the labs?

04:26.796 --> 04:28.968
Prints from the magazine he
tore up and the peanut cart...

04:29.038 --> 04:30.925
don't match
anyone in the system.

04:30.989 --> 04:33.356
Autopsy? I'm on my way
to the M.E. to check.

04:33.420 --> 04:37.578
Okay. Cassie Horner worked 9th and 10th
Avenues. Pay her colleagues a visit.

04:38.092 --> 04:40.548
Calling on courtesans.
Our specialty.

04:44.398 --> 04:47.398
Hey, we're just standing here.
We don't want no trouble, baby.

04:47.471 --> 04:49.992
Then how about some coffee
after a hard night's work?

04:50.064 --> 04:52.071
What's your name?
Honey, honey.

04:52.144 --> 04:54.150
You giving handouts,
you must want something.

04:54.224 --> 04:56.012
We're not Vice.
We're here about Cassie.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.120
And since when you care
what happens to us?

04:58.192 --> 05:01.542
Hey, we just spent $17 of our
own money on coffee and donuts...

05:01.617 --> 05:05.000
for you and your friends. If that's
not respect, I don't know what is.

05:05.074 --> 05:07.975
They're cool,
they wanna know about Cassie.

05:08.337 --> 05:11.054
Isn't it past quitting time?
Slow night.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.992
Well, someone ought to do that
sick bastard the way he did Cassie.

05:14.066 --> 05:16.074
Anybody see Cassie
leave with her last trick?

05:16.146 --> 05:20.456
Yeah. Beard. Crazy eyes. He walked
over to her, they talked a moment.

05:20.531 --> 05:23.849
Hear what they said?
No. Just his name, Daniel.

05:23.922 --> 05:27.120
I told Cassie I had a bad feeling
about him. She didn't heed your warning?

05:27.188 --> 05:29.807
She laughed, said she
could take care of herself.

05:30.133 --> 05:33.232
I wonder who's gonna
take care of her little girl.

05:34.613 --> 05:37.744
Had a tough time with this one, the
way he ripped her up and burned her.

05:37.813 --> 05:40.179
What'd you find?
Forty-two stab wounds...

05:40.243 --> 05:43.091
plus the cut to the throat
and the incision to the torso.

05:43.156 --> 05:45.459
Lab found one blood type
on the coat. The victim's.

05:45.524 --> 05:46.637
What about
the knife?

05:46.709 --> 05:50.256
Double-edge, serrated on
one side, 6 to 8 inches long.

05:50.837 --> 05:53.293
Military souvenir,
or collector's blade?

05:53.590 --> 05:55.182
A killer who's
a knife connoisseur.

05:55.254 --> 05:58.124
Whatever he is, he was in a
frenzy, like some kind of fever.

05:58.199 --> 06:01.068
Yeah.
Fever that spikes at night.

06:05.528 --> 06:07.700
We got something.
What's up?

06:07.769 --> 06:10.323
Lab got a DNA hit from
the sex offender database...

06:10.393 --> 06:12.181
on the semen
found in Cassie Horner.

06:12.248 --> 06:14.321
Norman Fredericks, 30,
on parole for rape...

06:14.393 --> 06:15.800
possession with
intent to sell...

06:15.866 --> 06:17.393
living on Staten Island.

06:17.465 --> 06:19.091
Has a job now
with a contractor.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.463
Palmieri's got the address of
the job he's working on now.

06:21.530 --> 06:23.603
He grew a beard. Didn't have
that when he was arrested.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.267
He got plenty of time
to grow one in prison.

06:25.339 --> 06:28.089
Munch and Fin are almost done with
the sketch artist and the witnesses.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.944
I'm gonna send them
as backup.

06:31.131 --> 06:32.113
Can I help you?

06:32.189 --> 06:34.773
Yeah. Police. We're looking
for Norman Fredericks.

06:34.843 --> 06:35.923
Back there.

06:37.245 --> 06:39.285
Norm, the cops are here.

06:50.941 --> 06:52.403
I didn't do anything!

06:52.669 --> 06:54.939
Innocent people always run.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.103
Norman Fredericks, you're
under arrest for murder.

06:58.174 --> 07:00.792
Murder? Yeah. That prostitute
you killed last night?

07:00.862 --> 07:02.619
We found your DNA
inside her.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.457
I picked up a whore, so what?

07:06.526 --> 07:07.771
So it's a parole violation,
pal.

07:07.838 --> 07:09.661
You're gonna send me
back upstate just for that?

07:09.728 --> 07:11.452
We're gonna send you back
for slicing up a hooker...

07:11.519 --> 07:12.665
when you were done with her.

07:12.735 --> 07:15.289
I didn't slice up anybody.
What time did you get home?

07:15.361 --> 07:18.359
In the door by 2:30 a. m.
And how'd you get there?

07:19.519 --> 07:22.869
Number one train to the Staten
Island Ferry. Then my car.

07:23.329 --> 07:26.908
We did our thing, I paid her
and left. I swear, I didn't...

07:29.538 --> 07:32.222
Don't make yourself at home.
We'll be right back.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.529
Fredericks is a busy guy.
What happened?

07:38.787 --> 07:41.121
Another victim.
Murdered last night.

07:44.387 --> 07:46.298
People passing by all day
and no one notices...

07:46.372 --> 07:47.997
until the roommate
comes home and finds her.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.074
Where's the roommate?
Bellevue Emergency.

07:50.147 --> 07:53.182
She was in shock, so we
had a radio car take her in.

07:53.508 --> 07:56.475
Fourteen years on the job, first
time I saw a body and puked.

07:56.548 --> 07:58.458
Perp did
a real number on her.

07:58.533 --> 08:00.867
Oh, man.
How long has she been dead?

08:00.933 --> 08:02.308
At least twelve hours.

08:02.374 --> 08:05.341
Handiwork's the same as
the last victim, only worse.

08:05.446 --> 08:07.814
Another pro? Short
black skirt, high heels.

08:08.295 --> 08:10.717
He slits their throats
so they can't scream.

08:11.303 --> 08:14.370
Appears to be the same knife
used on the hooker last night.

08:15.176 --> 08:17.250
What the hell's
wrong with this guy?

08:17.992 --> 08:19.684
Thinks he's
Jack The Ripper.

08:23.464 --> 08:26.498
You should have called me. We thought
we'd see if we had a case first.

08:26.569 --> 08:28.063
When my bosses tell me
that you guys...

08:28.138 --> 08:30.887
have a suspect and I don't already
know that, I look like an idiot.

08:30.953 --> 08:34.597
Alex, you know better than to think
that I would keep you out of the loop.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.903
I know. I'm sorry. It's just
two women ripped apart...

08:36.970 --> 08:39.784
within 24 hours by the same
perp, and everybody's edgy.

08:39.851 --> 08:42.371
We ready for a lineup yet? No,
it's premature until we're done...

08:42.443 --> 08:45.859
canvassing the second murder scene.
Do you have an I.D. on that victim yet?

08:45.932 --> 08:49.282
Theresa Folsom, 24, she's a
publicist for a publishing house.

08:49.421 --> 08:51.462
This is for her roommate.
She give you anything?

08:51.533 --> 08:54.827
You'll be the first to know.
Milk only, no sugar, right?

08:56.011 --> 08:57.059
Thank you.

08:58.795 --> 09:01.219
We know this is
difficult for you.

09:01.676 --> 09:03.781
When's the last time
you saw Theresa?

09:03.949 --> 09:06.152
Last night.
I mean, early this morning.

09:06.220 --> 09:09.091
We were club-hopping
with some friends.

09:09.165 --> 09:12.515
Terry got tired, so we...

09:15.758 --> 09:20.015
Sorry, we put her in a cab
at 6th Street and Avenue B.

09:20.367 --> 09:21.382
What time?

09:21.456 --> 09:25.002
Around midnight. We partied
a little bit more, and...

09:25.072 --> 09:26.925
I crashed at
my boyfriend's.

09:27.854 --> 09:29.797
Book publicists
don't make a lot of money.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.878
Do you know if Theresa
was doing any moonlighting?

09:31.952 --> 09:33.195
What do you mean?

09:33.264 --> 09:36.263
Well, maybe she made some
extra cash by entertaining men.

09:36.528 --> 09:39.496
My best friend is dead. I
don't need to hear this crap.

09:39.665 --> 09:42.829
No disrespect intended.
We have to ask.

09:43.056 --> 09:46.952
It's part of our job.
Terry has a boyfriend...

09:47.377 --> 09:50.891
Had a boyfriend in Boston.

09:51.474 --> 09:55.218
She wasn't promiscuous,
and she'd never pick up a guy.

09:57.874 --> 10:00.745
Theresa Folsom's squeaky clean. No
record, not even a traffic ticket.

10:00.818 --> 10:02.510
Fredericks giving you trouble?

10:02.579 --> 10:03.823
No, just keeping
an eye on him.

10:03.892 --> 10:04.874
What did he tell you?

10:04.947 --> 10:07.282
That he didn't get home
until 2:30 this morning.

10:07.349 --> 10:10.219
M.E. says Folsom was killed sometime
between midnight and 1:00 a. m.

10:10.293 --> 10:14.222
He picks up Cassie Horner, finishes her
off, cabs it down to the East Village...

10:14.294 --> 10:16.661
kills Theresa, with plenty of
time to make the 1:30 ferry...

10:16.726 --> 10:19.509
back to Staten Island.
Fredericks isn't our guy.

10:19.574 --> 10:20.589
Based on what?

10:20.663 --> 10:22.321
Lab found
two different blood types...

10:22.391 --> 10:25.141
at the last murder scene, Terry
Folsom's and probably the killer's.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.931
Neither matches Fredericks.

10:27.352 --> 10:30.734
Okay. So we book him on the parole
violation for soliciting a prostitute.

10:30.807 --> 10:32.497
And go back to
looking for the getaway cab.

10:32.567 --> 10:35.470
If this guy's a serial killer, he
might have been active somewhere else.

10:35.543 --> 10:37.234
Check VICAP
for any similar M.O.s.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.726
I'm gonna call Huang, see if
he can't give us a profile.

10:41.688 --> 10:42.735
He comes out at night...

10:42.808 --> 10:45.426
and focuses his rage at
prostitutes and women that he...

10:45.497 --> 10:48.498
believes to be prostitutes.
Just like London, 1888.

10:48.633 --> 10:50.291
Not Jack the Ripper
again.

10:50.361 --> 10:52.336
Ripperologists
are convinced that...

10:52.410 --> 10:55.410
his Royal Highness, Prince Albert
Victor, committed the deeds.

10:55.483 --> 10:58.036
And I understand the royal family
is still smarting over that...

10:58.107 --> 11:00.825
but could we please continue?
Actually, Captain, our guy...

11:00.892 --> 11:03.858
may be a wannabe. Especially if
he's a paranoid-schizophrenic.

11:03.932 --> 11:05.273
How do you explain the fire?

11:05.340 --> 11:08.022
Well, your witnesses say that he
talked of hellfire and damnation.

11:08.091 --> 11:10.809
Maybe he thought that
the victims were the devil.

11:10.876 --> 11:12.218
He didn't torch
the second woman.

11:12.284 --> 11:14.586
Well, maybe he heard
footsteps and ran off.

11:14.652 --> 11:16.594
Some witnesses reported
that he seemed drunk or high.

11:16.669 --> 11:18.971
Well, some schizophrenics
self-medicate with alcohol.

11:19.037 --> 11:20.466
So who we
looking for, Doc?

11:20.541 --> 11:23.705
A man mentally ill since
childhood or early adulthood.

11:23.773 --> 11:28.411
Could possibly have been institutionalized.
Not able to keep a job. Lives alone.

11:28.639 --> 11:32.731
Strong religious delusions. And he
might have command hallucinations.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.001
Voices telling him to kill.

11:35.071 --> 11:38.420
He's impulsive,
disorganized, unpredictable.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.621
And he's not gonna stop
until you catch him.

11:42.144 --> 11:46.105
Better make it soon. The press is
already calling him the "Night Ripper."

11:46.816 --> 11:49.434
We've gotta release the
sketch. That would be a mistake.

11:49.505 --> 11:52.221
If people are gonna panic, at least
give them something to panic about.

11:52.290 --> 11:54.078
The publicity's
just gonna excite him more.

11:54.145 --> 11:57.080
I think he's awful excited
right now without publicity.

11:57.378 --> 11:59.069
We'll consider
releasing the sketch.

11:59.138 --> 12:02.008
Meanwhile, I want every vice unit
out warning the working girls to be...

12:02.082 --> 12:04.506
watching out for this guy.
Where are we on the cabs?

12:04.580 --> 12:08.156
We've narrowed it down to 12 possibles,
before we got sidetracked with Fredericks.

12:08.226 --> 12:09.436
Run them down.

12:09.634 --> 12:11.325
Marcus, pick up line six.

12:11.394 --> 12:14.297
No, there's nothing with a Y in
the number on the street last night.

12:14.370 --> 12:17.884
Okay. How about your V cabs?
Well, we only have two.

12:17.987 --> 12:22.592
Let me look here, wait.
Wait a minute. Here it is.

12:22.981 --> 12:26.079
5- V-42.
Ran 9:00 p. m. to 9:00 a. m.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.476
Driver didn't even make
enough to cover his lease.

12:28.549 --> 12:31.037
Okay, any pickups
around 44th and 9th?

12:31.205 --> 12:33.825
Uh, not according to his trip
sheet. Can I take a look at that?

12:33.895 --> 12:35.204
Be my guest.

12:38.087 --> 12:39.493
Take a look at this.

12:39.845 --> 12:44.418
The driver put 82 miles on the car and
only logged jobs for maybe half of that.

12:44.486 --> 12:46.658
So he didn't drop the meter
on all of his fares.

12:46.727 --> 12:48.637
This driver. You have a
name and address for him?

12:48.711 --> 12:51.394
Yeah. Sure. No problem.
I'll get it for you.

12:53.864 --> 12:55.969
Last night when
you were driving your cab...

12:56.040 --> 12:58.975
did you pick up a fare
on 44th and 9th Avenue?

12:59.049 --> 12:59.998
No.

13:00.074 --> 13:03.042
You sure? You didn't log more than
half your jobs on your trip sheet.

13:03.113 --> 13:05.088
What are you
talking about?

13:05.322 --> 13:06.981
Maybe you forgot to drop
the meter...

13:07.052 --> 13:09.352
keep a little more money
for your family?

13:13.930 --> 13:17.280
I wasn't driving.
Okay. Who was?

13:17.994 --> 13:20.297
My cousin. Nkrumah?

13:23.468 --> 13:25.836
I pick up the cab,
let him drive.

13:26.444 --> 13:28.714
Make some money for
his family back home.

13:29.421 --> 13:31.593
He pick up the man
you're looking for.

13:32.205 --> 13:34.759
What's your name?
Kabral Nkrumah.

13:34.829 --> 13:36.456
Did you see his face?

13:36.526 --> 13:39.460
And his bloody clothes.
He scared me.

13:39.949 --> 13:43.560
Police car drove by, he lowered
his head so they would not see him.

13:43.693 --> 13:46.278
Okay. Can you describe him?
Medium height...

13:47.149 --> 13:50.663
wild eyes. Wild eyes.
Bushy beard.

13:50.990 --> 13:52.037
Where did you take him?

13:52.111 --> 13:56.236
3rd Street and Avenue D. Paid
me with a bloody $20 bill.

13:56.655 --> 13:59.241
Didn't wait for change.
We're gonna need that bill.

13:59.312 --> 14:01.548
Oh, I spent it.

14:01.968 --> 14:05.744
We're gonna need to get that cab to
CSU before it goes out for the night.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.976
Find anything? Yeah, we
vacuumed for hairs and fibers.

14:09.041 --> 14:11.344
Just getting ready to look
for blood. Let me light it up.

14:11.410 --> 14:13.003
If the guy had
victim's blood...

14:13.075 --> 14:15.016
on his coat, he must've
gotten some on his hands.

14:15.091 --> 14:16.300
Munch.

14:16.370 --> 14:18.672
Or he slipped and cut himself,
left us some evidence.

14:18.739 --> 14:20.877
Look, blood. I'll lift it
and get it to the lab.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.736
Yeah. We'll be right there,
gotta go.

14:22.802 --> 14:23.784
What?

14:23.860 --> 14:25.518
Jack strikes again.

14:27.603 --> 14:30.157
I'm washing my hands,
the kid is at the urinal.

14:30.228 --> 14:33.807
Guy comes in and starts screaming about
the machines controlling the boy's mind...

14:33.876 --> 14:36.911
pulls out a knife, slits
his throat. Just like that.

14:36.982 --> 14:37.963
Did he go after you next?

14:38.037 --> 14:41.812
I went after him, tried to grab
the knife. He got me in the stomach.

14:41.909 --> 14:44.397
That's when the boy's father
comes in. What happened?

14:44.471 --> 14:48.331
He never saw the guy with the knife. He
runs straight for his kid, starts screaming.

14:48.405 --> 14:50.510
I'm yelling at him
about the knife...

14:50.805 --> 14:53.707
then the guy slices his neck.
I couldn't do nothing!

14:53.781 --> 14:56.204
You did plenty. Take it easy.
We're gonna ride with him.

14:56.278 --> 14:57.391
Yeah. All right.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.372
What took you so long?
We were in Queens.

14:59.447 --> 15:00.462
We found the cab driver.

15:00.536 --> 15:01.845
Huang is on his way.

15:01.911 --> 15:04.529
Says he can profile more
accurately if he's on the scene.

15:04.599 --> 15:07.470
Radio said two victims?
Well, almost three.

15:07.577 --> 15:10.740
Good Samaritan got stabbed
in the gut trying to stop him.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.176
Who's she?

15:12.409 --> 15:17.199
This is Jean Weston. It's her
husband and son cut up in there.

15:17.466 --> 15:19.768
Tourists. I thought
he was targeting pros.

15:21.176 --> 15:23.064
How old's the kid?
Nine.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.852
Son of a bitch.

15:27.289 --> 15:31.283
Mrs. Weston,
I'm Detective Stabler.

15:31.578 --> 15:34.927
Josh just wanted
to play video games.

15:35.964 --> 15:39.312
We're going back to Oregon
tomorrow morning. I have to go pack.

15:39.547 --> 15:42.614
Okay, I'll tell you what. We're
gonna have the officer take you...

15:42.684 --> 15:45.466
to the hospital first and
just have you checked out.

15:46.876 --> 15:47.825
Okay?

16:00.158 --> 16:01.980
Got him in the left carotid.

16:02.046 --> 16:04.948
He probably lived about two
minutes before he bled out.

16:05.791 --> 16:06.935
Same knife?

16:08.319 --> 16:09.367
Yeah.

16:14.624 --> 16:17.178
Four victims within 24 hours.

16:17.249 --> 16:19.518
Three in the theater district,
Times Square area...

16:19.585 --> 16:20.926
one in the East Village.

16:20.994 --> 16:24.409
And a serial killer we can't
profile because he strikes at random.

16:24.705 --> 16:26.166
It doesn't get much worse
than this.

16:26.241 --> 16:29.537
Nobody is safe until we collar
this guy. Chief Sullivan?

16:29.858 --> 16:32.859
The city is terrified, and the public
doesn't give a rat's ass how much...

16:32.931 --> 16:35.746
we brought crime down as
long as this guy is out there.

16:35.811 --> 16:37.917
I want to thank all of you who
came in on your own time.

16:37.988 --> 16:40.288
Clock in. We need all
the help we can get.

16:40.354 --> 16:43.585
Captain Cragen runs the task
force and reports directly to me.

16:43.812 --> 16:47.522
The phone bank is being set up,
with the reward up to $100,000.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.687
We're gonna be flooded with
tips. We investigate every one.

16:50.820 --> 16:53.407
You have your assignments.
Let's find this guy.

16:53.958 --> 16:55.201
What'd you get?

16:56.134 --> 16:59.777
Canvass, Avenue D.
Canvass on Avenue C.

16:59.941 --> 17:02.495
I'm Avenue B.
You're Avenue A, I guess.

17:02.566 --> 17:04.835
Palmieri's taking Avenue A.
Anything from VICAP?

17:04.902 --> 17:06.429
Nobody active fitting our guy.

17:06.502 --> 17:08.030
Yeah. That would've been
too easy.

17:08.102 --> 17:11.298
John, before you hit the streets, I
want you to get an update from the M.E.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.123
Okay, Boss. See you
guys later. All right.

17:13.190 --> 17:14.304
Set?

17:15.047 --> 17:17.895
I want you coordinating the
phone tips and the assignments.

17:17.958 --> 17:20.545
Our case, then why
am I being benched?

17:20.809 --> 17:24.125
I need somebody I can trust in charge
while I tap-dance for the bosses.

17:24.201 --> 17:26.436
Nobody sweats the details
like you.

17:27.913 --> 17:29.318
Okay. Go get him.

17:30.439 --> 17:34.052
Detective Stabler. Missus
Weston. I said you were busy.

17:34.345 --> 17:37.641
We're closing on our new house
next week. I have to get home.

17:37.769 --> 17:41.827
Mrs. Weston, do you have any relatives
or friends in New York you can stay with?

17:41.897 --> 17:44.385
I don't know anyone here.

17:45.066 --> 17:48.416
I don't...
Elliott. Phone call.

17:50.410 --> 17:52.997
Mrs. Weston, this is
Detective Palmieri. Right here.

17:53.067 --> 17:55.849
He's gonna get you coffee,
food, whatever you want.

17:55.915 --> 17:58.337
I'll be with you
in just a minute, okay?

17:59.180 --> 18:00.740
See if you can find
a family member.

18:00.812 --> 18:02.722
Okay. Why don't you
come with me?

18:09.261 --> 18:12.611
Special Victims, Detective...
Hey, Kathy.

18:14.221 --> 18:16.744
No. It's just good
to hear your voice.

18:17.359 --> 18:19.847
The unidentified blood at the
second murder scene and the blood...

18:19.919 --> 18:22.188
CSU got from the cab
are the same type. AB.

18:22.255 --> 18:24.842
Which puts our man at the first
two scenes. We won the trifecta.

18:24.912 --> 18:28.393
We found only the victim's blood at
the arcade, but take a look at these.

18:28.465 --> 18:29.413
You know Locard's theory?

18:29.489 --> 18:30.766
Transfer evidence.
Everywhere you go...

18:30.833 --> 18:32.622
you pick something up and
leave something behind.

18:32.690 --> 18:34.444
Seven years in Homicide,
I better know it.

18:34.511 --> 18:37.960
CSU took this from inside the
perp's coat found in the garbage can.

18:38.225 --> 18:40.165
This was on the body
of Terry Folsom...

18:40.240 --> 18:42.957
and this was in the pooled blood
next to Josh and Jeremy Weston.

18:43.025 --> 18:45.098
Consistent blends.
Some kind of spun fiber.

18:45.168 --> 18:48.912
Ran it through the gas chromatograph.
It's a 60-40 cotton wool blend.

18:49.010 --> 18:51.530
I'm a summer weight
wool-gabardine man myself.

18:51.762 --> 18:55.560
Your perp wore the same piece of
clothing when he killed all four victims.

18:57.075 --> 18:58.155
Thanks.

19:01.204 --> 19:04.586
Forget the canvass. We got a
disturbance in Washington Square Park.

19:04.661 --> 19:08.436
A suspect in the murders is being
held by civilians. Let's get there now.

19:08.629 --> 19:11.213
Special Victims. Excuse me!
Police. Coming through. Excuse me.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.593
Show's over!
Excuse me.

19:12.661 --> 19:14.930
Bus is on the way along
with the rest of our backup.

19:14.996 --> 19:16.273
What the hell happened here?

19:16.340 --> 19:19.689
Someone heard this guy accost a
pro over on 4th Street, spouting...

19:19.765 --> 19:22.866
something about Armageddon.
Next thing, a dozen people...

19:22.934 --> 19:25.586
they chase him in here, and
they kick the crap out of him.

19:25.654 --> 19:26.767
He's not even close.

19:26.839 --> 19:30.549
Okay, people. Look at this.
This is our man. Beard and hair.

19:30.743 --> 19:34.092
This man has no beard and no
hair. Bastard shaved it off!

19:34.169 --> 19:37.431
Yeah! Tried to kill another
whore! Who's gonna be next?

19:37.497 --> 19:40.562
Get outta here or both you are going
in for assault, all right? All of you.

19:40.631 --> 19:44.692
Hang in there, all right? The ambulance
is on its way. Just take it easy, okay?

19:44.984 --> 19:48.334
These people have a serious
problem. Yeah, they're scared.

19:50.650 --> 19:53.650
Hey.
Hey, you survived riot duty.

19:54.363 --> 19:56.850
Hope you had better luck
than we did. How's it going?

19:56.922 --> 20:00.785
Five hundred calls since 11:00,
more sightings than Elvis.

20:00.860 --> 20:02.354
Anyone wanna trade places?

20:02.427 --> 20:04.795
No thanks. We're just too busy
waiting for him to strike again.

20:04.859 --> 20:08.537
Look, it's 4:00. Why don't
you guys catch some shut-eye?

20:08.956 --> 20:10.994
Don't have to
ask me twice.

20:11.258 --> 20:13.047
Not at home, in the crib.

20:20.508 --> 20:23.858
You, too. Oh, no. I'm
too pissed to sleep.

20:24.029 --> 20:27.510
You want some help?
I'm not gonna say no.

20:34.752 --> 20:36.726
"Spotted on Broadway."

20:37.567 --> 20:40.535
It looks like the subway
token clerk at 68th and Lex.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.418
He's my night doorman.

20:43.486 --> 20:45.374
I know you're working off
some nervous energy...

20:45.438 --> 20:48.341
but you don't have to read
every one of them out loud.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.223
Aren't we in a mood?

20:56.705 --> 21:00.218
You know, it's the middle of the
night, and I'm sitting here...

21:00.387 --> 21:03.802
realizing I spend more time with
you than I do with my own family.

21:05.442 --> 21:08.792
No offense.
We both need a vacation.

21:10.563 --> 21:12.285
You got that right.

21:15.140 --> 21:17.987
Wait a minute.
Here's one with a guy...

21:18.146 --> 21:21.496
says somebody gave him a check
with bloody fingerprints on it.

21:21.699 --> 21:22.943
Where?

21:25.093 --> 21:27.394
I didn't take it.
Counterman did.

21:27.461 --> 21:31.291
Did you see who cashed it? I was
slicing prosciutto in the back.

21:31.365 --> 21:34.049
I assumed it was Mrs. Varney.
It's her check.

21:34.118 --> 21:37.086
Hold on. I'll get it.
It's in the top.

21:38.503 --> 21:41.852
Check is issued out to Cash.
Name on the check, Paula Varney.

21:47.781 --> 21:49.855
I gave this check
to my husband.

21:49.926 --> 21:52.577
Did something happen to him? No,
we just want to speak with him.

21:52.647 --> 21:55.647
Has he left for work?
Daniel doesn't live here.

21:55.718 --> 21:58.980
Girls, run upstairs and get
dressed, okay? We're gonna be late.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.150
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

22:01.224 --> 22:05.284
The day before yesterday,
when I gave him the check.

22:05.865 --> 22:08.037
I help support him.
You're divorced?

22:08.266 --> 22:12.968
Separated, it's hard to explain.
Daniel's had some problems.

22:13.227 --> 22:15.169
What kind of problems?

22:16.138 --> 22:20.230
Three years ago, he started losing
it. He got fired from his job.

22:20.330 --> 22:24.128
I had to start teaching again. We
didn't get divorced so Daniel could...

22:24.204 --> 22:27.979
stay on my medical insurance.
Not that he would see a doctor.

22:28.428 --> 22:32.455
Mrs. Varney,
is this your husband?

22:33.646 --> 22:34.987
Oh, my God.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.642
It is urgent
that we speak with him.

22:39.246 --> 22:43.108
Our priest gave him a small
room in a rectory of our church.

22:43.822 --> 22:45.612
What is this about?

22:46.222 --> 22:49.191
Has he done something?
Hurt someone?

22:49.424 --> 22:51.279
Well, we're not
quite sure yet.

22:53.615 --> 22:57.227
He's a janitor at the church.
Our Lady of Lourdes.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.396
Thanks.

23:01.007 --> 23:05.067
Judge signed the warrant, Munch and Fin
are on their way to toss Varney's room.

23:13.329 --> 23:16.746
Trimmed his beard.
Look at his hands.

23:18.642 --> 23:19.591
Daniel?

23:22.515 --> 23:25.862
Yes, I'm Daniel. Hi. Can
we talk to you a second?

23:27.026 --> 23:29.809
Who are you?
We're the police.

23:31.538 --> 23:33.229
His avenging angels cometh.

23:35.475 --> 23:36.784
We just want to
ask you a question.

23:36.851 --> 23:38.794
Presence of the Lord.
You cannot, you cannot hide.

23:38.867 --> 23:41.650
You cannot hide in the presence of
the Lord. He sent you to judge me?

23:41.716 --> 23:44.880
No, not to judge you.
To help you.

23:44.980 --> 23:47.314
Why? I served him.

23:47.380 --> 23:50.764
I saw that they were unclean and
I cleansed them in their own blood.

23:50.837 --> 23:52.910
I saved a child,
a lamb that was pure.

23:52.981 --> 23:56.811
Daniel, come with us.
Come with us.

23:56.886 --> 23:58.063
Wasn't I good enough?

23:58.133 --> 24:00.174
Wasn't I good enough? Why do
you send your angels for me?

24:00.245 --> 24:02.668
Why do you want to destroy me
when I bring them your message?

24:02.742 --> 24:04.717
I saw that
they were unclean.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.482
Why do you send
your angels for me?

24:06.551 --> 24:08.406
Why? Why do you want
to destroy me when I...

24:08.471 --> 24:09.900
bring them your message?

24:09.976 --> 24:13.326
No. Not to destroy you.
He wants to reward you.

24:13.848 --> 24:15.191
He will judge me!

24:15.256 --> 24:16.915
Our Father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

24:16.985 --> 24:18.546
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

24:18.617 --> 24:20.309
on earth as it is in Heaven.
As it is in Heaven.

24:20.378 --> 24:21.720
Give us this day
our daily bread...

24:21.786 --> 24:24.504
and forgive us
our trespasses...

24:26.523 --> 24:28.312
Pray with me!
Yeah.

24:28.378 --> 24:29.360
Got it.

24:29.434 --> 24:30.384
And lead us not
into temptation...

24:30.458 --> 24:31.407
but deliver us from evil.

24:31.483 --> 24:32.792
Daniel Varney.
For thine is the kingdom...

24:32.860 --> 24:34.070
the power and the glory
forever and ever.

24:34.138 --> 24:35.121
You're under arrest
for murder.

24:35.195 --> 24:38.579
You have the right to remain
silent. If you give up that right...

24:38.652 --> 24:41.817
whatever you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

24:41.885 --> 24:44.339
My God. You have the
right to an attorney.

24:47.836 --> 24:49.243
Why did you do it?

24:49.309 --> 24:51.196
Get back. Get in.

24:54.814 --> 24:57.083
Are you sorry
for what you've done?

25:06.111 --> 25:07.605
Who are you?

25:08.639 --> 25:09.948
Detective Benson.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.686
I need to ask you
a few questions.

25:20.256 --> 25:21.566
About what?

25:23.360 --> 25:25.663
About what you did
to those four people.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.497
I was following orders.

25:31.619 --> 25:32.601
From who?

25:32.673 --> 25:35.804
From the Lord God almighty,
who is in heaven...

25:37.378 --> 25:39.232
sent through his messenger.

25:40.962 --> 25:43.776
What messenger, Daniel?
An angel who came to me...

25:44.578 --> 25:46.334
and told me to cleanse them.

25:48.451 --> 25:51.485
I have to ask you something.
What?

25:52.452 --> 25:54.240
Why didn't you shoot me?

25:55.524 --> 25:57.531
Because I didn't want
to hurt you.

25:58.948 --> 26:00.192
But you must.

26:01.541 --> 26:03.549
I must what, Daniel?
I don't understand.

26:03.621 --> 26:06.272
Kill me, please.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.693
Please, I can't take
any more pain.

26:18.279 --> 26:20.385
We better put him
on a suicide watch.

26:25.128 --> 26:28.030
M.E. says Varney's knife matches
the wounds on all four victims.

26:28.105 --> 26:29.861
Anything from John and Fin?

26:29.929 --> 26:32.964
They're on their way to the lab with
bloody clothes from Varney's room.

26:33.034 --> 26:34.857
Found them
hanging in the closet...

26:34.922 --> 26:36.778
like he just brought them
back from the cleaners.

26:36.842 --> 26:40.354
Good enough for me. Type up those
reports. Let's get him into court.

26:45.033 --> 26:47.040
Docket number 3-5-2-1-4...

26:47.113 --> 26:49.056
People vs.
Daniel Stephen Varney.

26:49.130 --> 26:51.464
Charges are four counts
murder in the first degree...

26:51.531 --> 26:54.281
one count assault
in the first degree.

26:54.635 --> 26:57.603
I trust, Miss Cabot, the People
have met their burden for murder one?

26:57.675 --> 26:59.650
Yes, Your Honor. The defendant
mutilated and killed...

26:59.724 --> 27:01.513
four people
in under 48 hours.

27:01.580 --> 27:04.101
Their blood was found on clothing
in Mr. Varney's apartment.

27:04.173 --> 27:05.449
Very well.

27:05.581 --> 27:08.931
Mr. Newvine, how does your
client plead? Are you God?

27:11.437 --> 27:15.910
Just an overworked judge, Mr. Varney,
and I ask the questions, not you.

27:16.813 --> 27:20.491
Guilty or not guilty? How can
you judge me if you're not God?

27:20.974 --> 27:23.822
Mr. Newvine,
control your client.

27:24.783 --> 27:28.046
We plead not guilty by reason of
mental disease or defect, Your Honor.

27:28.112 --> 27:31.014
Daniel, please.
Miss Cabot?

27:31.153 --> 27:33.258
Remand, Your Honor.
The defendant is clearly a...

27:33.328 --> 27:34.921
No!

27:35.248 --> 27:37.900
You can't judge me.
No!

27:39.089 --> 27:41.097
You can't judge me!
Order! Order!

27:41.169 --> 27:43.024
You don't sit
in judgment of me!

27:43.089 --> 27:44.463
No!

27:44.529 --> 27:47.879
No, he can't help it,
he's sick.

27:48.018 --> 27:51.367
You can't touch me!
He can't help it!

27:51.954 --> 27:54.955
He can't help it, he's sick.
I'm sorry!

27:58.259 --> 28:00.169
Miss Cabot...

28:00.243 --> 28:02.699
you want to kill him. Mrs.
Varney, I can't talk to you.

28:02.773 --> 28:04.332
Please, don't kill him.

28:04.437 --> 28:06.411
Do you want justice or
are you just gonna swing...

28:06.484 --> 28:08.209
whatever way
public opinion blows you?

28:08.277 --> 28:09.936
Mrs. Varney, please.

28:10.005 --> 28:12.821
He was a loving husband,
a good father...

28:12.886 --> 28:16.877
He murdered four people. Taking
his life won't bring them back.

28:17.684 --> 28:21.613
I know I have to live with what he
did, and our girls have to grow up...

28:21.748 --> 28:23.341
knowing that
he killed those people...

28:23.412 --> 28:25.071
But I have to speak
for the victims...

28:25.141 --> 28:27.858
and for their families,
and follow the law.

28:28.054 --> 28:30.127
Doesn't the law
protect Daniel, too?

28:30.550 --> 28:33.234
He didn't know what he
was doing. He's sick.

28:33.462 --> 28:37.238
Mrs. Varney, a terrible thing happened to
you and your family and I am sympathetic...

28:37.303 --> 28:38.613
The hell you are!

28:38.809 --> 28:42.322
You put murderers and rapists
back on the street every day...

28:42.489 --> 28:45.073
he didn't even know he
was doing anything wrong.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.375
Please, Miss Cabot.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.647
I'm sorry.

28:58.714 --> 29:00.175
We're seeking
the death penalty.

29:00.249 --> 29:03.447
Daniel belongs in a psychiatric
hospital, not on death row.

29:03.642 --> 29:07.702
That's for a jury to decide.
He's not competent to stand trial.

29:08.059 --> 29:09.074
He attacked me.

29:09.147 --> 29:10.936
All that proves
is that he's violent.

29:11.005 --> 29:14.071
Spontaneously violent.
No impulse control.

29:14.589 --> 29:16.377
Your client solicited
a prostitute...

29:16.444 --> 29:18.745
and lured her into an alley
way before he mutilated her.

29:18.811 --> 29:20.273
He threw
his bloody coat out.

29:20.348 --> 29:22.454
He ducked down in the cab so
the police wouldn't see him.

29:22.525 --> 29:24.631
He knew exactly
what he was doing.

29:24.924 --> 29:28.274
How are you feeling, Daniel?
My head won't stop hurting.

29:29.277 --> 29:31.449
We'll give you something
for the pain.

29:32.734 --> 29:35.767
Were you angry at your attorney?
I don't have an attorney.

29:37.055 --> 29:38.582
You hit him in court.

29:39.647 --> 29:43.358
Why was I in court? Because of
what you did to those people.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.069
I killed them.
God said I had to.

29:54.175 --> 29:56.380
"You are my messenger.

29:57.120 --> 30:01.823
"The unclean must be cleansed, or
I will serve my wrath upon you!"

30:03.169 --> 30:05.274
But the Bible says,
"Thou shalt not kill."

30:05.346 --> 30:08.379
He said I must
eliminate the evil.

30:09.506 --> 30:11.449
That little boy was evil?

30:12.482 --> 30:16.706
The video games put
evil thoughts in his head.

30:17.572 --> 30:19.295
I had to save him.

30:20.516 --> 30:22.786
I didn't want
to kill a little boy.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.585
He said I had to.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.457
I had to.

30:49.896 --> 30:53.246
Alex, your office said
you were here.

30:53.609 --> 30:56.421
D.A. just signed the papers to seek
the death penalty against Varney.

30:56.488 --> 30:59.357
He can't stand trial.
What are you saying?

30:59.751 --> 31:03.100
He's not competent. He
knows what he did was wrong.

31:03.273 --> 31:04.734
The man is a serial killer.

31:04.808 --> 31:07.591
Who doesn't fit any profile
that I can come up with.

31:07.818 --> 31:10.884
You saw him at Bellevue. He doesn't
even remember slugging his attorney.

31:10.954 --> 31:13.322
We've convicted schizophrenics
and psychotics before.

31:13.387 --> 31:16.735
Schizophrenia usually strikes
young adults and teenagers.

31:16.906 --> 31:18.728
Daniel Varney may appear
to be psychotic...

31:18.795 --> 31:21.578
but his loss of memory suggests
something else is going on.

31:21.642 --> 31:23.847
What?
Organic dementia.

31:24.812 --> 31:26.471
A disease
attacking his brain.

31:26.539 --> 31:31.110
Mini-strokes, early onset
Alzheimer's, a brain tumor, something.

31:32.459 --> 31:35.176
Do you know how much pressure
I am under to convict this man?

31:35.243 --> 31:36.650
He butchers
four innocent people.

31:36.715 --> 31:39.880
He scares the hell out of the
city. The public wants justice.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.709
What can we do?
A complete workup.

31:44.814 --> 31:49.450
Labs, MRI, LP. And I need your
detectives to get his medical records.

31:52.109 --> 31:54.412
What is it you want?
Your help.

31:54.478 --> 31:56.748
I'm not helping you
kill my husband.

31:56.814 --> 31:58.920
Girls, go up to
your room and play.

32:01.774 --> 32:03.978
Do you have children,
Detective Benson?

32:04.430 --> 32:05.772
No, I don't.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.868
Have you ever lost
anyone close to you?

32:10.352 --> 32:12.970
Yes, I have. Earlier this
year, I lost my mother.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.980
Then you know
how it feels.

32:17.105 --> 32:20.140
When you lose a parent as
an adult, it's hard enough.

32:20.210 --> 32:22.446
Can you imagine what
my girls are going through?

32:22.514 --> 32:24.402
Mrs. Varney, please,
understand that...

32:24.467 --> 32:26.835
we are not trying to make this
any worse than it already is...

32:26.899 --> 32:28.754
You want to execute
my husband.

32:30.420 --> 32:34.249
We already lost him once.
I can't face losing him again.

32:37.589 --> 32:41.899
What did you come here for?
Your husband's medical records.

32:42.613 --> 32:43.562
Why?

32:43.670 --> 32:47.019
To see if there's anything that
can help explain what he did.

32:52.918 --> 32:54.642
I'll never understand.

32:55.895 --> 32:57.683
I'll never understand.

33:01.528 --> 33:06.164
Daniel was the gentlest man
I'd ever known.

33:07.223 --> 33:12.013
Then he started to change. I begged
him to see a doctor. He refused.

33:12.985 --> 33:15.287
Even our priest couldn't
convince him to get help.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.800
One night, I woke up.

33:19.479 --> 33:22.033
I found Daniel
standing in the girls' room...

33:22.104 --> 33:24.887
holding a knife. Crying.

33:27.257 --> 33:29.559
He said
life was so hopeless...

33:30.459 --> 33:32.760
he wanted to
spare them the pain.

33:37.914 --> 33:39.736
Do you care about
any of this?

33:41.946 --> 33:44.152
You have to trust me.

33:49.115 --> 33:50.545
We finished going through
his records.

33:50.619 --> 33:52.725
Varney's medical history
ends three years ago...

33:52.796 --> 33:55.610
which is about the time that his
wife says his bizarre behavior began.

33:55.677 --> 33:56.920
Anything noteworthy?

33:56.988 --> 33:59.639
Aside from his high blood
pressure, this guy was healthy.

33:59.708 --> 34:02.098
The labs are back.
What'd you find?

34:02.333 --> 34:03.894
Advanced syphilis.

34:05.982 --> 34:07.160
How advanced?

34:07.263 --> 34:10.743
Tertiary stage. The MRI shows
cortical degeneration and atrophy.

34:10.813 --> 34:13.496
Meaning what?
His brain is Swiss cheese.

34:13.661 --> 34:15.998
The syphilis has eaten away
at his cerebral cortex.

34:16.063 --> 34:20.286
The moral center of his brain is
long gone. We've got to tell his wife.

34:21.632 --> 34:23.772
He's already been given
a death sentence, Alex.

34:23.841 --> 34:26.688
We've given him penicillin,
but the damage is done.

34:27.585 --> 34:29.146
He's not gonna recover.

34:37.251 --> 34:40.929
They said I could see him. Have
the doctors talked to you yet?

34:42.594 --> 34:44.056
What about?

34:45.154 --> 34:47.489
You were right,
Mrs. Varney.

34:48.963 --> 34:50.818
It wasn't
your husband's fault.

34:52.226 --> 34:54.431
Mrs. Varney,
your husband has syphilis.

34:55.940 --> 34:59.737
Oh, my God.
It's destroyed his brain.

35:02.405 --> 35:05.220
Well, what does that mean?
What about my daughters?

35:05.286 --> 35:07.425
What about me? We've been
married for ten years.

35:07.493 --> 35:10.910
You'll have to be tested, but our
doctor says that it's only contagious...

35:10.982 --> 35:14.724
in the early stages. Your
husband's case is so advanced...

35:14.854 --> 35:17.919
that he probably picked it up
long before you even met.

35:18.758 --> 35:21.988
I don't understand.
How could no one find this?

35:22.150 --> 35:24.540
He's been to doctors,
he had an insurance physical...

35:24.615 --> 35:27.398
Medical insurance?
Life insurance.

35:27.720 --> 35:31.069
Seven years ago, when our
first daughter was born.

35:31.272 --> 35:33.990
Was he approved?
No.

35:34.890 --> 35:37.573
Well, did the insurance
company ever tell you why?

35:39.050 --> 35:41.538
We thought it had to
do with his hypertension.

35:42.218 --> 35:44.074
Mrs. Varney, if you ask
the insurance company...

35:44.139 --> 35:46.987
why your husband was rejected,
they have to tell you.

35:48.393 --> 35:50.760
Does it really matter now?
Yes. It really matters.

35:50.826 --> 35:52.898
You've got to request
those records.

36:04.557 --> 36:05.801
I missed you.

36:05.869 --> 36:08.358
Hi, honey. Me, too.

36:09.230 --> 36:11.783
The girls miss their daddy.
How are they?

36:12.462 --> 36:14.983
They're fine. How are you?

36:17.584 --> 36:19.817
It hurts so much.

36:22.508 --> 36:23.719
I'm sorry.

36:38.927 --> 36:41.416
Paula Varney got an answer
from All-Atlantic Life.

36:41.489 --> 36:43.115
They knew
that he had syphilis.

36:43.184 --> 36:44.746
Bastards never informed him.

36:44.818 --> 36:46.444
Communicable,
sexually transmitted...

36:46.513 --> 36:49.262
disease, company's required to
report that to the health department.

36:49.330 --> 36:52.558
And health department would have
notified Varney if they'd known.

36:52.624 --> 36:54.927
One shot of penicillin back
then could have cured him.

36:54.993 --> 36:56.716
And these four victims
would still be alive.

36:56.785 --> 36:59.241
Yeah, if the insurance
company had told them!

36:59.665 --> 37:01.357
I want their ass.

37:09.716 --> 37:12.018
What is this?
Malcolm Hunt?

37:12.084 --> 37:13.743
And who are you?
Police.

37:13.813 --> 37:15.754
Come up from behind
the desk, please.

37:15.829 --> 37:16.844
I don't take orders from you.

37:16.918 --> 37:19.405
Malcolm Hunt, you're under
arrest for reckless endangerment.

37:19.477 --> 37:21.266
Reckless endangerment?
For what?

37:21.333 --> 37:24.082
For failing to notify the health
department about an applicant's...

37:24.149 --> 37:27.149
communicable disease which
caused him to murder four people.

37:27.222 --> 37:29.109
How dare you walk in here
and accuse me...

37:29.173 --> 37:30.581
Your lawyer
can explain it to you.

37:30.646 --> 37:33.036
No, you're the ones who can
explain. On whose authority?

37:33.110 --> 37:34.637
We have a warrant,
signed by a judge.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.915
And if you don't come with us
voluntarily, we'll take you.

37:36.984 --> 37:38.642
Now please put your
hands behind your back.

37:38.712 --> 37:41.843
Is this necessary?
Standard procedure.

37:42.232 --> 37:44.143
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:44.217 --> 37:45.939
If you give up that right,
anything you say...

37:46.009 --> 37:48.082
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

37:48.857 --> 37:51.246
You need a head
to mount on your wall...

37:51.673 --> 37:54.129
so my client
becomes the scapegoat.

37:54.935 --> 37:56.791
We checked with
the health department.

37:56.856 --> 38:00.052
You never reported Daniel Varney's
syphilis as required by law...

38:00.121 --> 38:01.747
It must have
slipped through the cracks.

38:01.817 --> 38:04.817
It's the applicant's responsibility
to ask why he was rejected.

38:04.890 --> 38:08.207
Who's responsible for the four people
he murdered because you didn't tell him?

38:08.282 --> 38:10.868
We reject thousands of
applicants every year.

38:10.939 --> 38:12.532
HIV, heart disease.

38:12.603 --> 38:13.814
All poor risks.

38:13.883 --> 38:16.153
Miss Cabot, we run a business.

38:16.219 --> 38:18.554
We answer to our stockholders.

38:18.684 --> 38:22.743
Providing explanations to
every applicant we turn down...

38:22.813 --> 38:25.083
would require
hiring more staff...

38:25.150 --> 38:27.515
premiums would go through
the roof, and fewer people...

38:27.581 --> 38:29.622
could afford life insurance.

38:30.973 --> 38:33.844
$1.50 worth of penicillin would
have cured Daniel Varney...

38:33.918 --> 38:37.367
and prevented the carnage he
caused. You should have told him.

38:37.726 --> 38:41.502
The Court of Appeals just ruled that we
are under no obligation to inform the...

38:41.567 --> 38:45.429
The applicant. You still have to notify
the appropriate health department.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.506
If we audit your records and
find a pattern of similar cases...

38:48.577 --> 38:49.786
that have "slipped through
the cracks"...

38:49.855 --> 38:51.611
with no effort
on the part of your company...

38:51.680 --> 38:53.087
to rectify the situation...

38:53.153 --> 38:55.738
not only will we charge Mr. Hunt
with reckless endangerment...

38:55.810 --> 38:59.223
we will move to seize the profits of
your company as assets to the crime.

38:59.296 --> 39:01.631
See how your stockholders
like that. You can't do that...

39:01.697 --> 39:05.113
And Mr. Hunt can sit in prison
for seven years and think about it.

39:09.217 --> 39:11.040
What do you want, Miss Cabot?

39:11.489 --> 39:15.265
I want your company to begin reporting
all cases of communicable diseases.

39:15.556 --> 39:18.720
And when the families of the murder
victims and Daniel Varney's wife sue...

39:18.788 --> 39:19.998
you'll settle.

39:20.515 --> 39:23.298
That's extortion. It would
cost the company millions.

39:23.427 --> 39:26.876
It'll cost a lot less than going
bankrupt because of the publicity.

39:26.948 --> 39:29.665
In the court of public
opinion, you're already guilty.

39:29.732 --> 39:32.415
Do you want to take your
chances in a real court?

39:43.972 --> 39:46.625
I've read the 37 report on
your client, Mr. Newvine.

39:46.695 --> 39:49.661
Do you wish to introduce
any other evidence?

39:50.790 --> 39:52.035
No, Your Honor.

39:52.711 --> 39:53.823
Miss Cabot...

39:53.894 --> 39:56.447
does the District Attorney
plan to contest the findings?

39:56.518 --> 40:00.032
Not at this time, Your Honor. The People
are satisfied with the doctor's report.

40:00.103 --> 40:03.453
Then I rule the defendant
Daniel Stephen Varney...

40:03.560 --> 40:05.502
not competent to assist
in his own defense...

40:05.575 --> 40:07.649
therefore unfit
to proceed to trial.

40:08.232 --> 40:11.582
I order him remanded to the custody
of the Office of Mental Health...

40:11.657 --> 40:15.716
to be placed in a secure psychiatric
facility until he is fit to proceed.

40:17.130 --> 40:18.755
This court is adjourned.

40:19.754 --> 40:23.235
Until he's fit to proceed.
Which is never.
