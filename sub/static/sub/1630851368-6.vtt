WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:02.968
- Previously on
"The Challenge."

00:03.037 --> 00:06.171
We get down and dirty.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.576
- Lesley lets me know

00:10.644 --> 00:12.144
that Amber is
one of his targets this week.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.779
She's my partner.
And I just think

00:13.848 --> 00:16.548
it's the dumbest move
for our bed alliance right now.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.786
- Esther and Fessy,
you are the agency.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.654
Which woman do you want
to send down here

00:22.723 --> 00:24.923
to go against
our compromised agents?

00:24.992 --> 00:26.125
- Unfortunately, it's Amber B.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.493
- [bleep].

00:27.561 --> 00:28.827
- You can't protect [bleep]
everybody.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.364
- Josh, how many people are you
trying to protect in this game?

00:32.433 --> 00:34.900
- A lot of people
didn't wanna see me back.

00:34.969 --> 00:37.403
You just put a fire in my ass.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.304
- It's like, are you an enemy
or you a [bleep] friend.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.306
- Even though I know
it's better in the long run,

00:41.375 --> 00:44.043
I don't feel like I have
anything to apologize for.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.578
- Today's mission is called
minefield.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.215
- Go, Berna.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.851
- Berna and CT,
congratulations.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.353
You are now the agency,

00:54.422 --> 00:56.989
so you are the only team
that is safe from elimination.

00:57.058 --> 01:00.893
Agents, lock in which one team
you want to compromise.

01:00.961 --> 01:05.164
- I am the rookie so everyone
is going to jump all over me.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.365
- CT.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.100
- Oh, we're going
to go with Gabo.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.370
- Gabo, Logan, tonight you
are playing Higher Ascent.

01:11.439 --> 01:14.039
- Go ahead, Logan.
- Tick.

01:14.842 --> 01:19.044
- All right, Logan wins.
Now either take Gabo's partner,

01:19.113 --> 01:23.015
Emy or infiltrate and steal
any other partner up there.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.850
- Nany.
all: Yeah!

01:24.919 --> 01:27.319
- Logan, Nany, you are
now partners.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.122
Hughie, Emy,
you two are partners.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.356
- This couldn't be any better.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.792
We have another
rookie-rookie team.

01:33.861 --> 01:36.195
The vets have dominated
this game.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.898
We will continue
to dominate this game.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.620
[indistinct chatter]

02:01.689 --> 02:03.689
- Did you hear me?
- Hell yeah.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.958
- Hell yeah, I can do it.
Hell yeah.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.327
Yeah, I'm really happy
for Logan.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.028
I love him.
Logan's awesome.

02:10.097 --> 02:13.232
He's a dude who I can trust
so I'm glad he's back.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.667
- Hey, my guy.

02:21.642 --> 02:25.344
- The whole game that's been
kind of going on to season

02:25.412 --> 02:26.945
is the rookie-rookie pairs
always going in.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.413
- Yeah, yeah.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.315
- So now I'm--I like
kind of--I accept that.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.918
It's just irritating
because I don't even know

02:32.987 --> 02:36.889
if it was even a hope in trying
to turn around the house

02:36.957 --> 02:38.824
and not vote in the
rookie-rookie pair this time.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.259
- Well, you never know.
You never know.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.194
Like anything could change
in a second.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.196
- I am majorly on
the chopping block.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.631
I am in a rookie-rookie pair,

02:45.699 --> 02:47.399
which is literally
the worst position

02:47.468 --> 02:49.301
you can ever be in
in this game.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.603
I need to be away from Emy
as fast as possible.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.238
And I need to get
with a veteran girl

02:53.307 --> 02:54.573
who's going to keep me
in the game.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.375
I have a lot of thinking to do.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.380
- You thought you were
probably going in,

03:01.448 --> 03:03.382
probably going to go home,
all that kind of stuff.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.117
You didn't go in
and you got a new partner.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.752
- My fourth partner.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.221
Praying to God
I go to the fifth.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.089
Jesus, it's a [bleep] record.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.391
- Where would you go to?

03:12.459 --> 03:13.792
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

03:13.861 --> 03:14.960
- She doesn't care anymore.
She's swinging.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.762
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.630
- She don't care.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.832
I-I like Emy.
I like what she's about.

03:20.901 --> 03:26.638
She's this outcast
that is on fire.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.707
I do think she's young
in the head

03:28.776 --> 03:33.045
and I think if she can control
this fire that's consuming her,

03:33.747 --> 03:36.315
she--she can do some damage
on this challenge.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.783
You're going straight
to the top.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.284
- Straight to the chopping
block.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.453
I-I'm just getting
used to this.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.622
- I don't care
who gets mad at me. Yeah.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.192
- Yeah. It's a mood.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.794
- It's a vibe.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.762
- It's a vibe.
- Vibe city.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.497
- Vibe city.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.866
- Emy, she's my friend.
She's like my sister.

03:54.935 --> 03:59.571
She is sometimes
going too deep in her head

03:59.640 --> 04:02.274
and she gets anxious,
but she's a tough skin.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.043
That's one of the things
I love about her.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.747
- I-I like the new attitude.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.516
Like whatever comes my way
comes my way.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.653
- I listen to advice
all the time.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.756
I have one uncle
in this competition honestly.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.591
- Sometimes I feel
like I'm lonely.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.826
I feel like I'm too different

04:20.894 --> 04:22.961
and I cannot stick
in any group.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.964
Since I was a little kiddo,
I was bullied.

04:26.033 --> 04:29.968
But I feel like CT is
the realest OG in this game.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.737
He's my favorite uncle
in the whole world

04:31.805 --> 04:34.973
and it's also
a lot of respect for him.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.954
- This is the thing.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.589
The only day Fessy is going
to do what's best for Fessy.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.424
He doesn't do what's best
for Fessy and me.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.592
He doesn't do what's best
for Fessy, me and Kaycee.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.993
It's what's best for Fessy

04:55.062 --> 04:57.796
and then we deal
with all the [bleep] backlash.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.665
So I'm still trying
to make it make sense.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.868
My number one wins
and he votes in Hughie

05:02.936 --> 05:05.337
and he votes
in his number one's partner.

05:05.906 --> 05:11.276
It wasn't strategic. It was
personal against Amber B.

05:11.345 --> 05:16.081
And then I felt like it was
directly shot at my game.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.517
- I don't know how long
you guys have been close,

05:18.585 --> 05:19.985
but I feel like

05:20.054 --> 05:22.688
I have that kind of
relationship with somebody,

05:22.756 --> 05:26.258
things like this are bound to
happen in a game like this.

05:26.327 --> 05:31.029
And I feel like you guys should
have a conversation about it.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.832
- The cool thing about Esther
and Fessy being partners

05:33.901 --> 05:35.667
is that even though me
and Fessy are in a bad spot,

05:35.736 --> 05:37.769
me and Esther have
a really good bond.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.972
And just her energy and her
positivity and just her vibes

05:41.041 --> 05:42.841
is just so good to be around
and I kind of just,

05:42.910 --> 05:45.210
like, gravitate towards her
whenever she's in her room.

05:45.279 --> 05:48.080
I'm still pissed off.
I'm [bleep] heated.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.049
But you know, he is good to you
and you guys are a great team

05:51.118 --> 05:54.453
and you're a strong team so
it has nothing to do with you.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.054
It's me and him.

05:56.123 --> 06:00.325
- I'm close with Josh.
And I don't like the fact

06:00.394 --> 06:04.663
that he and Fessy
are not on good terms.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.699
And I really do want them
to speak to each other

06:07.768 --> 06:10.135
and just settle
their differences

06:10.204 --> 06:13.372
and go back to being friends.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.874
- It's not something
against you.

06:15.943 --> 06:16.975
- Sorry.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.044
- It's okay.

06:21.248 --> 06:24.349
- I think that you need
to go talk to Josh and I think

06:24.418 --> 06:27.319
that you need to apologize
for hurting his feelings.

06:27.388 --> 06:29.588
What do you think about that?

06:31.658 --> 06:33.258
- Yeah, I agree.

06:33.327 --> 06:35.327
- I don't know what is
taking Fessy so long.

06:35.396 --> 06:39.297
Like time's ticking and if you
guys don't figure this out now,

06:39.366 --> 06:42.200
I don't want it to explode
into something more.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.303
- I just feel like I always
have to keep apologizing

06:45.372 --> 06:49.241
and apologizing for things when
it's like, he doesn't even see.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.676
- Maybe you're wrong.
- Am I wrong?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.345
- Maybe you're the [bleep]
problem. I don't know.

06:53.414 --> 06:56.214
- Am I wrong? You tell me.
You're an outsider with me.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.750
- I think that you need
to take his feelings

06:58.819 --> 07:00.185
into consideration.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.787
- What are his feelings
exactly? What is he--

07:01.855 --> 07:04.456
- I think he feels like
you don't listen to him.

07:05.459 --> 07:08.126
And he feels like
it's not fair.

07:11.131 --> 07:16.067
- ♪ All I want to get
is a little bit closer ♪

07:17.971 --> 07:22.407
♪ All I wanna know is
Can you come a little closer? ♪

07:22.476 --> 07:23.575
- Hi.

07:23.644 --> 07:28.046
- Hi, this is for you.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.247
[all speaking at once]

07:29.316 --> 07:32.617
- Thank you. You're so calm.

07:36.623 --> 07:43.495
[all speaking at once]

07:43.564 --> 07:46.398
- You did all of this?
- Yes.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.267
[indistinct]

07:49.336 --> 07:52.137
- Aw.

07:52.206 --> 07:55.040
- I wanted to make
this special for you.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.808
- Oh, my gosh.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.811
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

07:59.880 --> 08:01.079
- Is everybody watching?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.514
[all speaking at once]

08:02.583 --> 08:06.751
[cheers and applause]

08:06.820 --> 08:08.186
- You guys are so cute.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.621
- We love you guys!
I'm gonna make sure

08:09.690 --> 08:12.757
everyone goes in.
Don't worry.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.760
- Kaycee is surprised Nany
with a date night.

08:15.829 --> 08:20.165
Everything is so cute
and it makes me sick.

08:20.234 --> 08:22.000
I'm so lonely.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.304
- I'm gonna try not to cry
right now.

08:27.140 --> 08:30.509
Oh my God.

08:30.577 --> 08:34.145
Oh, my goodness.
Come here.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.981
Thank you so much.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.149
- I'm glad you like it.
- I love that.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.118
- You had no idea, huh?
- No idea.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.287
One of the reasons
why I love Kaycee

08:42.356 --> 08:46.324
so much is how thoughtful
and considerate she is.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.960
Just the fact that
so many other people

08:49.029 --> 08:50.795
knew about
this entire date night

08:50.864 --> 08:54.232
and I had no idea
makes it even more special.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.601
- You deserve happiness.
You deserve to be loved.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.136
You deserve effort.

08:58.205 --> 09:02.841
And I appreciate you so much.
I really do.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.312
- Thank you for this
great night.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.847
- Of course.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.917
- After everything that
went down with Josh and Fessy.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.518
- Oh.
- So much drama.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.786
- So much drama.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.221
Josh is mad because he feels
like

09:16.290 --> 09:17.923
I have Fessy's back--Fessy's
back before his,

09:17.991 --> 09:19.090
and he does not like that.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.126
- Yeah.
I do feel bad for Kaycee

09:21.194 --> 09:23.895
because Kaycee
is 100% stuck in the middle.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.163
Josh is pulling her one way.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.798
Fessy's pulling her
the other way

09:26.867 --> 09:29.200
and it makes it very hard
for Kaycee to play this game.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.103
Josh sees things one way for
whatever's best for his game

09:32.172 --> 09:34.272
as much as he says he's trying
to look--which I know he is.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.840
He's trying to look out
for our game as well

09:35.909 --> 09:38.944
but he--it's more for himself.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.513
- It's all bad.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.281
- I'm glad I have you.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.999
- In this house,
there's no privacy

10:01.068 --> 10:03.702
so it's really hard
to have a single moment

10:03.770 --> 10:06.071
to hook up
or try to, you know, like just.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.315
God.

10:17.384 --> 10:20.986
- I-I like Josh.
I think he's attractive.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.758
- Honestly, I don't know.

10:47.414 --> 10:50.015
- Ahh!

11:06.900 --> 11:09.868
- Oh yeah.

11:23.350 --> 11:27.852
- Drip, drip, drip, drip,
drip, drip.

11:27.921 --> 11:32.924
- What's up, agents?
[cheers and applause]

11:32.993 --> 11:35.894
Whoa.
Today is going to be so sick.

11:35.962 --> 11:40.732
- Yeah!
Yeah, it's gonna be sick.

11:40.801 --> 11:44.769
- So sick. As you can see,
we have some bad-ass drift cars

11:44.838 --> 11:47.272
that we'll be using
for today's mission.

11:47.340 --> 11:52.077
And I hate to break it to you
but today you are going to be

11:52.145 --> 11:56.414
strapped to the roof
of those drift cars.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.450
- Yes!

11:59.352 --> 12:02.087
- Today's mission is called
Turning Agents.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.955
Two teams at a time
are going to race back

12:04.024 --> 12:06.424
and forth down this runway
to each tanker.

12:06.493 --> 12:10.161
On those tankers, there are
symbols to unlock your lockbox.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.030
You're going to unlock
the lockbox

12:12.099 --> 12:15.667
and detonate a smoke bomb.
That will stop your time.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.536
But it's not going to be easy
because the entire time

12:18.605 --> 12:20.772
those cars
are going to be doing donuts.

12:20.841 --> 12:24.609
The team with the fastest time
will win today's mission,

12:24.678 --> 12:26.144
become our agency.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.913
It will be the only team
safe from elimination.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.416
Everyone else on
the chopping block, all right?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.631
- Let's go!

12:46.700 --> 12:49.701
Don't do these kind of things.
I will fall down.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.204
Okay. I feel like
I'm going to vomit already.

12:53.273 --> 12:57.509
- All right. Berna, CT, Ashley,
Josh, you ready?

13:00.514 --> 13:04.315
Go.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.687
- This car starts doing donuts.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.824
I am terrified and I'm just
praying that this car

13:12.893 --> 13:14.859
doesn't flip over right now.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.867
- All right. Berna, CT,
Ashley, Josh, you ready?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.235
- No.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.037
- Go.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.409
- Today's mission is called
Turning Agents.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.511
You're strapped
to the top of the car.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.647
Drive down the runway
and start doing donuts.

13:35.715 --> 13:38.149
While we're doing the donuts,
we have to count symbols.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.119
The symbols correlate to
a number of a combination lock.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.587
And if we count them
up correctly,

13:42.656 --> 13:46.124
we get the combination block
done faster and we win.

14:13.587 --> 14:17.422
- This is the best experience
in my life.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.090
I felt like a rock star

14:19.159 --> 14:21.326
on a concert
in a Hollywood movie.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.862
It's like this is
a dream come true.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.673
- I didn't get any.
- What?

14:35.742 --> 14:38.142
- We had nothing there.
- A three. Okay, three.

14:38.211 --> 14:43.548
- Three. That's right. Okay.

14:43.617 --> 14:45.416
- The strategy that I come up
with right off the rip

14:45.485 --> 14:46.584
is that I'm going

14:46.653 --> 14:48.419
to try to remember
three of the symbols

14:48.488 --> 14:50.555
that we have to remember
and I give one to Ashley.

14:50.624 --> 14:54.192
And I think that we're gonna be
able to get a really fast time

14:54.261 --> 14:56.594
because I feel like
we're both good with memory.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.329
- What's in the fourth?

14:58.398 --> 15:01.132
- Number five.
You get the second one.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.043
- I got the second one.

15:23.290 --> 15:27.225
- One, two, three.
One, two, three.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.130
- Me and Berna
aren't really talking.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.665
I'm starting to believe

15:33.733 --> 15:35.967
that we're on two different

15:36.036 --> 15:38.670
ends of the spectrum
on this challenge.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.438
Red flags are going up.

15:42.642 --> 15:43.808
- One right.

15:43.877 --> 15:47.178
- One? Okay.
- Let's go!

15:58.825 --> 16:02.260
- Start with number six.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.629
- Josh and I are killing
this mission today.

16:04.698 --> 16:06.831
We work together
like peanut butter and jelly.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.534
And Josh and I are
communicating effortlessly.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.836
- So 4667?

16:12.272 --> 16:14.272
- Yeah, yeah, got it.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.443
- Yeah!

16:22.816 --> 16:25.583
- Feels so good because even
though when the first heat,

16:25.652 --> 16:27.051
our time was so fast

16:27.120 --> 16:29.587
that I think that we're going
to be the time to beat today.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.322
- [inaudible]
done it. That was [bleep].

16:31.391 --> 16:33.224
- Yeah, baby. Good [bleep].

16:33.293 --> 16:36.561
- Yeah, Josh. Good job!

16:37.797 --> 16:39.697
- Stop right at the truck
right when you hit

16:39.766 --> 16:40.999
that--hit that e-brake

16:41.067 --> 16:43.067
and just pause
for a good couple seconds.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.536
Turn off the car
and then we'll be good.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.338
My man, let's go.

16:51.478 --> 16:54.946
- I'm so excited.
This is [bleep] crazy.

16:55.015 --> 16:59.584
Mom, I love you. I love Kaycee.
I know we're gonna do good.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.019
But I'm really excited.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.054
- We're gonna win this.
Hey, man, we're gonna win this.

17:03.123 --> 17:07.925
- Let's go. I'm not scared.
I'm not scared. Just watch me.

17:07.994 --> 17:11.029
- Kaycee, Emanuel, Bettina,
and Cory, get ready.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.332
- Let's hit it!

17:27.247 --> 17:28.713
- Emanuel's in charge
of the last two numbers.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.882
I'm in charge
of the first two numbers.

17:30.950 --> 17:34.018
And I'm just going to focus on
my symbols and my symbols only.

17:34.087 --> 17:37.121
And hopefully, we get this
done faster than everyone else.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.071
- There's no more excuses

17:53.139 --> 17:54.705
when it comes to me
and Bettina.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.141
I think we're competing against
one of the best teams here.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.910
We're going against
Kaycee and Emanuel

17:58.978 --> 18:00.745
and we gotta bring our a game

18:00.814 --> 18:03.581
because I know that
they're going to bring theirs.

18:04.918 --> 18:08.386
- I'm facing backwards
so obviously Cory will have

18:08.455 --> 18:13.424
so much longer time
than me to memorize them signs.

18:13.493 --> 18:18.062
So if we lose,
I bet he'll blame it on me.

18:24.838 --> 18:30.475
- Whoa. Damn, this is so fun,
but we got to win this.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.110
I haven't been
to the Lair yet,

18:32.178 --> 18:36.280
but I feel like if I don't
win today, I'm gonna go down.

18:36.816 --> 18:40.118
I need to protect Emy too,
so I need to win.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.429
- Kaycee, five and six.
- Mine was four and six.

18:52.732 --> 18:58.536
Cory's done. Cory's done.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.571
- [inaudible]
I opened mine.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.709
- Let's go! Let's do it.
It's open. Let's go! Let's go!

19:08.014 --> 19:11.015
- [bleep] [bleep].

19:11.084 --> 19:13.618
- Emanuel is my heart
and my soul.

19:14.053 --> 19:15.820
He's a monster. He's a beast.

19:15.889 --> 19:18.689
And he's gonna be the winner
of the challenge.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.626
And he also said that he will
make me a music video

19:21.694 --> 19:23.394
if--if he wins.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.664
- That was fast.
That was [bleep].

19:34.274 --> 19:36.908
- Emy, Hughie, Devin, Amber,
you ready?

19:36.976 --> 19:39.510
Go.

19:56.095 --> 19:59.530
- For me, it is very important
to win today just because

19:59.599 --> 20:02.266
of a little slick [bleep]
that Fessy wanted to do,

20:02.335 --> 20:04.835
but it is crazy
going around in circles

20:04.904 --> 20:06.737
trying to memorize
these things.

20:06.806 --> 20:10.374
I'm feeling nauseous right now.
I'm not off to a great start.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.453
- The only team that can't win
today's mission

20:22.522 --> 20:24.689
is Emy and Hughie,
which means as long as we beat

20:24.757 --> 20:26.424
Emy and Hughie,
we have done our job.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.559
We have kept the
veteran alliance strong

20:28.628 --> 20:31.395
and everyone should repay us
accordingly.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.701
- I was feeling like Batman.
I'm flying.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.869
I'm like Rose
when she was in "Titanic."

20:38.938 --> 20:43.207
I just need to keep my brain in
this game and get this correct

20:43.276 --> 20:46.344
and prove everybody wrong again
like I have before.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.915
- Amber, the first number
is three.

20:55.855 --> 21:00.391
- Three. 97.

21:01.894 --> 21:05.463
Seven.
Hughie.

21:05.531 --> 21:09.000
Me and Hughie are not
working together at all.

21:09.068 --> 21:12.270
Hughie is dead on top
of the car after shouting.

21:12.772 --> 21:16.874
Hughie, tell me.
Hughie, are you there? Nothing.

21:16.943 --> 21:22.446
Hughie, can you answer?
Nothing. Cut. I'm pissed.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.884
- Watch the bottom.

21:28.688 --> 21:34.925
- Oh, it's--it's four--4656.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.599
- Whoo!

21:45.138 --> 21:50.641
- Nany, Logan, big T, Jeremiah,
you ready? Go.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.181
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

21:57.250 --> 22:01.519
- I-I am so dizzy right now.
I can't see anything.

22:01.587 --> 22:06.957
And this is terrifying.
I got nothing done.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.517
- Nelson, don't fall off.

22:33.586 --> 22:37.521
At least get at least
one hazard sign. Come on.

22:38.658 --> 22:42.026
- 46. 946. I got it.
Top two is 46.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.703
- Yes! Yes!

23:04.751 --> 23:06.384
- Sometimes I get dizzy for
fun.

23:06.452 --> 23:09.687
You know, I'll sit in the chair
and spin around. I'm ready.

23:12.959 --> 23:16.394
I've got it.
I've got it.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.170
- All right, everyone.
That was so sick.

23:28.808 --> 23:32.209
Three teams got it done
the fastest out of everyone.

23:32.512 --> 23:37.114
Josh and Ashley.
Kaycee and Emanuel.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.916
- All right, Kayce.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.752
- Esther and Fessy.

23:43.890 --> 23:48.592
However, the one team
to get it done the fastest was.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.096
- I just don't want
Fessy and Esther to win.

23:52.165 --> 23:53.697
They keep saying my name.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.466
So you say it once,
you're going to say it again.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.768
So Fessy and Esther
cannot win today.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.742
- The one team to get it done

24:04.811 --> 24:10.014
the fastest was

24:10.082 --> 24:11.549
Kaycee and Emanuel.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.417
- Let's go!

24:13.486 --> 24:18.122
[all speaking at once]

24:18.191 --> 24:21.358
- I am so excited. We've been
waiting so damn long for this.

24:21.427 --> 24:23.060
We had a plan. We executed.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.129
We were efficient.
It's awesome.

24:25.198 --> 24:27.498
- I'm really proud of Kaycee.
I know how much of a fighter

24:27.567 --> 24:29.533
she is
so I know she's feeling good

24:29.602 --> 24:31.702
and that makes me
feel good for her.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.637
- You are now the agency.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.507
You're the only team safe
from elimination.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.642
Everyone else are in danger.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.345
You must go back
to headquarters

24:41.414 --> 24:44.915
and nominate one team
to send into the Lair with me

24:44.984 --> 24:46.851
where they'll fight for their
right to stay in the game.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.753
And then our agency will choose
one man and one woman

24:49.822 --> 24:51.856
to go in
against our compromised agents.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.625
- Kaycee and Emanuel, honestly,

24:54.694 --> 24:56.026
you never know
what they could do,

24:56.095 --> 24:58.896
especially because the lines
are starting to be drawn.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.664
I think it's really clear
that anything can happen

25:00.733 --> 25:02.299
in this game.
I think Kaycee

25:02.368 --> 25:05.002
is one of the most
unpredictable players ever.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.780
- How did you think we done
in the challenge?

25:16.849 --> 25:17.948
Was I a good partner?

25:18.017 --> 25:20.317
- No. Yes or no. It's why.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.453
There wasn't really
any point in us winning

25:22.522 --> 25:25.523
because we have to separate
and take people's partners.

25:25.591 --> 25:29.493
That's the plan. Me and Emy
as the only rookie-rookie pair.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.862
We're 1,000,000%
going into elimination.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.297
There's no point
in saying anything else.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.866
It's like ask does
a dalmatian have spots.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.935
Of course, it does.
It's happening?

25:42.542 --> 25:43.941
- Good job, [bleep].

25:44.010 --> 25:45.476
- We did it. We did it.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.778
- So I mean, I have a couple
of names in my head

25:47.847 --> 25:49.146
but, you know,
I feel like tonight

25:49.215 --> 25:50.981
we should just listen
in what people you know.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.616
- That's what I thought.
- Just listen in.

25:52.685 --> 25:53.784
- See what people have to say.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.085
- See what people
have to say,

25:55.154 --> 25:58.522
assuming that Hughie and EMy
are going to go in.

25:58.591 --> 26:00.958
- Hughie and Emy, they're--
they're most likely to go in

26:01.027 --> 26:04.662
because they're rookies
but since Emy's my friend,

26:04.730 --> 26:08.399
I want to get the weakest
players against them

26:08.467 --> 26:10.067
so they have a chance to win.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.169
- Hughie and Emy, let's see
the names that they give us

26:12.238 --> 26:13.837
who they feel like
they have the best chance.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.640
But we should tell them
we want them to come back

26:16.709 --> 26:19.810
'cause I know it's still--it
is still really--

26:19.879 --> 26:21.579
- [inaudible].

26:21.647 --> 26:24.748
- It's like risky. It's like,
do you--if you--you--you rock

26:24.817 --> 26:26.517
the boat this soon

26:26.586 --> 26:28.886
'cause I feel like we're in
a good place right now.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.287
With this win,
I really do want to stick

26:30.356 --> 26:32.489
with the--the Vet Alliance
and the plan that we have,

26:32.558 --> 26:35.192
but then there's also
a part of me where it's like,

26:35.261 --> 26:37.294
"Who's gonna take
that first shot?"

26:42.935 --> 26:46.670
- How is your relationship
with like Kaycee and?

26:47.006 --> 26:48.839
- It's cool but I probably
know I'm going down.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.007
- Do you think would go down?
- Yeah, yeah.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.408
- How do you feel about that?

26:51.477 --> 26:52.710
- I'm the only rookie

26:52.778 --> 26:54.311
that not--like,
we haven't been down.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.813
- How do you feel about that?
- I'm not tripping.

26:55.881 --> 26:57.715
It's coming--it was
coming anyway.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.483
I'm not afraid
to go into elimination.

26:59.552 --> 27:01.151
So we're just gonna go in.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.953
We gon' do our thing
and we coming back up in here.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.121
- Yeah.
- So like I'm cool going down.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.956
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.
Okay.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.191
If you want to go
to elimination,

27:07.259 --> 27:09.226
you are not taking me down
with you.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.028
I won't be offended
or take it personally

27:11.097 --> 27:12.696
if you don't let me back
as partner.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.965
- No, I feel you. I feel you.
Yeah like.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.367
- You do--do what's best
for you

27:16.435 --> 27:19.069
and I won't take it
personally or anything.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.904
Or I might.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.308
- I feel that we've had
a good game,

27:24.377 --> 27:26.410
but right now it's me, you,
and Bettina

27:26.479 --> 27:30.247
that haven't been in the Lair.
So right now,

27:30.316 --> 27:32.416
I feel like my head's
on the chopping block.

27:33.819 --> 27:37.488
but at the same time I feel
like anything could happen.

27:37.556 --> 27:41.091
- And it's like if we escape
it this time around, next time

27:41.160 --> 27:43.494
it's probably gonna be us
if we don't win.

27:43.562 --> 27:47.031
I've avoided the Lair so far by
just staying under the radar.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.899
I call myself
the silent assassin

27:48.968 --> 27:51.035
and that's what
I continue planning to do.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.970
I just feel like
I'm in a really weird,

27:53.039 --> 27:55.072
like, limbo place.
I'm floating by.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.675
So that's the thing that's kind
of like going through my head.

27:57.743 --> 28:01.445
- At this point, everyone knows
that very soon there would be

28:01.514 --> 28:02.746
no rookie-rookie pairs

28:02.815 --> 28:05.149
left so shots
are gonna get fired.

28:05.217 --> 28:08.485
And I think people see me
as a strong competitor,

28:08.554 --> 28:10.854
so I'm beginning
to feel nervous.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.790
I don't want to go down
into elimination.

28:12.858 --> 28:15.125
God, I don't want
to go down there.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.228
- I just really hope
that we just have more time.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.139
- I'm into a dress
or tracksuit.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.042
- No. Not a [bleep] tracksuit.

28:32.611 --> 28:34.645
This is your night to show out.
Show out.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.246
- But I'm gonna sing a song.

28:36.315 --> 28:40.484
Oh, my goodness, Ash.
This is like a t-shirt.

28:40.553 --> 28:41.985
- Let it all hang out, honey.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.389
- If Emy comes to the wicked
witch wing of the west

28:45.458 --> 28:47.491
which is mine, Ashley,
and Nany's room

28:47.560 --> 28:49.626
and since she might be on
the chopping block this week,

28:49.695 --> 28:52.362
she deserves to live her
best life tonight at the club.

28:52.431 --> 28:56.967
And who better to get her ready
than the Satan Sisters, baby.

28:57.036 --> 29:00.003
- Oh my God, that is hot.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.638
- You actually look
really hot with that.

29:01.707 --> 29:03.507
- Dude, you look really good.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.976
You look like
a little sex demon,

29:06.045 --> 29:07.077
but you can't wear those shoes.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.779
- No.
- My glittery boots.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.247
all: Yes!

29:10.316 --> 29:12.983
- This is it.
- Here she comes.

29:13.686 --> 29:17.354
- ♪ Whatever you give life,
you will get back ♪

29:19.525 --> 29:24.294
♪ Why be a wallflower when

29:25.831 --> 29:30.234

29:40.112 --> 29:43.514
♪ Nothing in this world

29:45.684 --> 29:47.217
- Special night, guys.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.753
We're doing a sort of challenge
unplugged and we know

29:49.822 --> 29:51.688
Emy is no stranger to emotions,

29:51.757 --> 29:55.192
but she's been trying really
hard to control those emotions.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.262
Emy is a famous singer
in Romania.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.698
And tonight, she's going
to put up a show.

30:01.767 --> 30:03.267
She's an artist. I love her.

30:03.335 --> 30:06.703
- I have an original song
that I wrote before coming here

30:06.772 --> 30:08.472
and, like, all my feelings,

30:08.541 --> 30:10.841
I just want to--I
just want to share it with you.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.577
That's all. I'm really nervous
to sing in front of everyone,

30:13.646 --> 30:16.446
but since it looks like
I'm going into elimination,

30:16.515 --> 30:17.748
it can be my only chance.

30:17.817 --> 30:21.485
This means a lot for me.
The song is called "Alien"

30:21.554 --> 30:23.854
because I'm feeling like
an alien in here all the time.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.589
- We love you.

30:26.892 --> 30:30.727
- ♪ I'm an alien

30:30.796 --> 30:34.731

30:44.977 --> 30:46.910
- Emy--Emy's growing on me.
I-I just love the girl.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.312
I think she's got
a lot of heart.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.214
She has this fire inside of
her.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.548
Think she's awesome.

30:51.617 --> 30:55.919
all: ♪ I'm an alien
I'm an alien ♪

30:55.988 --> 30:59.489
♪ I feel so alone right here ♪

30:59.558 --> 31:01.558
- I feel like a rock star
on stage.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.961
I'm shocked
that they're singing along

31:04.029 --> 31:06.129
and I was really happy
and proud of myself.

31:06.198 --> 31:09.633
It means a lot for me.

31:09.702 --> 31:13.403
- Emy is a rockstar.
I absolutely love her.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.305
- Emy's song is definitely
going to be a banger.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.841
I still have the melody stuck
in my head.

31:17.910 --> 31:21.879
♪ I'm an alien, I'm an alien ♪

31:21.947 --> 31:25.115
- Emy's like another sister
to me so it's just so nice

31:25.184 --> 31:28.185
to see how she feels
a little more loved tonight.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.120
I really liked that.

31:31.991 --> 31:37.761
all: Emy! Emy! Emy! Emy!

31:43.535 --> 31:46.803
- Here you go. I feel like
Fessy's ego rubbing off of you.

31:47.273 --> 31:50.040
I need to keep you
the good girl that you are

31:50.109 --> 31:52.009
because he's corrupting.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.378
Now every time I come in top
three, you come and talk to me.

31:54.446 --> 31:55.646
It's like, "Oh, you did good.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.547
Not good enough
but you did good."

31:57.616 --> 31:59.216
You know what I like
about you though?

31:59.285 --> 32:01.151
We have a good time together.
We crack [bleep] jokes.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.486
And like when you come around,

32:02.554 --> 32:04.154
it's always very positive,
fun vibe.

32:04.223 --> 32:07.090
Like you help me disconnect
from, like, the game

32:07.159 --> 32:08.792
and from,
like, this whole [bleep] thing.

32:08.861 --> 32:09.927
- Aw.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.161
- You do.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.330
- Oh, look, look, look.
Josh and.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.970
- Get your act together,
Esther.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.672
You have to play
with your head.

32:21.740 --> 32:25.175
No feelings whatsoever
attached to him.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.610
- Esther [indistinct].

32:26.679 --> 32:29.813
- You like to claim yours, huh?
- Yes.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.283
- Me and Josh are beefing.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.219
He has a crush
on my partner, Esther.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.022
He's upset I just threw
in Amber into elimination.

32:39.091 --> 32:41.325
So as far as
the Big Brother Alliance,

32:41.393 --> 32:45.028
this is all getting
very messy very fast.

32:48.334 --> 32:49.933
- I just don't understand
why Fessy did that.

32:50.002 --> 32:52.469
Like I'm so confused.
I haven't talked to him since.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.638
- Well.
- I don't know what to say.

32:54.707 --> 32:56.440
It's like why do I need
to go up to you

32:56.508 --> 32:58.141
when you did what you did?
Like.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.610
- Maybe he feels bad, that's
why he didn't talk to you yet.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.747
- And a part of it makes me
feel like it's his partner.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.216
It was just like,
"Why would you do that to me

33:06.285 --> 33:08.118
and--and let alone
blindside me?"

33:08.554 --> 33:10.053
Like at least give me
a heads up.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.822
If I'm going in,
I'm cool with that.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.690
I'm a scrapper just like you.
I'll go in and I'll fight.

33:13.759 --> 33:16.626
I'll do what I gotta do.
But like, don't blindside me.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.162
- Since I threw Amber down
in the Lair,

33:19.231 --> 33:21.031
me and Amber
really haven't spoken.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.066
- You need to talk to him.
- I know.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.501
I'll eventually talk to him.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.236
I don't feel like
right now it's time

33:26.305 --> 33:27.971
because I wanted to come
from, like, a genuine place.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.674
- You could say I'm sorry.
She could say she's sorry.

33:30.743 --> 33:32.576
But at the end of the day,
if she were to win,

33:32.644 --> 33:35.212
she would take a shot at me
so there's no reason

33:35.280 --> 33:37.681
to try to fix this
if it's already broken.

33:37.750 --> 33:42.285
- Well, I don't like
the surprises. [bleep].

33:44.456 --> 33:47.591
- What do you think Fessy
is going to do?

33:47.659 --> 33:49.292
- First of all.

33:51.096 --> 33:52.496
- Right?

33:52.564 --> 33:57.801
- You never because Kaycee
is too close to Fessy

33:57.870 --> 33:59.436
and they really like you.
They genuinely

33:59.505 --> 34:02.339
- I think so. I hope so.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.074
- I think they will go
for Jeremiah

34:04.143 --> 34:09.212
for the boys and Amber because
I think they really like her.

34:09.681 --> 34:12.716
- Yeah, she is so fake.
It's so [inaudible].

34:12.785 --> 34:15.819
- This the reason why I think
Amber is fake.

34:16.121 --> 34:20.724
Nice people don't go around
telling people that I am nice.

34:20.793 --> 34:25.462
I play a loyal game. Prove it.
Let me see it.

34:25.531 --> 34:29.633
You don't need to say it.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.638
- She's just so fake.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.709
I just can't believe
how Amber is walking around

34:39.778 --> 34:42.446
telling everyone
how good she got,

34:42.514 --> 34:44.548
like, blindsided last season,
this season.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.283
It's like just too much, Amber.

34:46.351 --> 34:49.419
Like if you're loyal,
we will see it.

34:50.456 --> 34:52.456
Oh my God,
I can't even watch her.

34:59.498 --> 35:03.867
[all speaking at once]

35:10.642 --> 35:11.842
- We get back to headquarters

35:11.910 --> 35:13.810
and everyone
is just in a great mood.

35:13.879 --> 35:17.714
And one thing all the agents
do after getting home

35:17.783 --> 35:19.449
is feast on pizza.

35:20.018 --> 35:22.886
I think everyone does that
after a club night, right?

35:27.192 --> 35:28.592
- That's just [bleep] up.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.294
Who would just, like,
take a pizza out and eat it?

35:32.131 --> 35:35.966
I literally requested
that pizza, like, specifically.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.434
That's why I'm pissed.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.903
- Amber, there's like
10,000 other pizzas.

35:39.972 --> 35:42.139
Somebody took it away.
There are a lot of drunk

35:42.207 --> 35:44.107
and hungry people
in this house.

35:44.176 --> 35:45.842
Take another one, put it in,

35:45.911 --> 35:48.011
sit down and wait
for your [bleep] pizza.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.747
- Come here.
- Amber, he ate your pizza.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.616
Oh, 100%. 100%

35:52.684 --> 35:53.984
- Come here. Come here.
Come here.

35:54.052 --> 35:55.819
- Fessy ate your pizza.
Fessy ate your pizza.

35:55.888 --> 35:59.222
- I lied and said it was Fessy.
It wasn't Fessy.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.690
He ate your pizza.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.526
I just think
it would be funny

36:02.594 --> 36:05.795
if Amber thought Fessy
ate her pizza.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.898
- You wanna know how I know
you know they're lying?

36:09.067 --> 36:11.434
- You saw me put in my pizza
and you said,

36:11.503 --> 36:14.037
"Okay, I'm in the next round."
He ate the pizza.

36:14.106 --> 36:16.973
- It's boring in this house
right now, you know?

36:17.042 --> 36:18.175
I'm going to stir it up

36:18.243 --> 36:19.809
a little bit and see
what we can get out of it.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.711
- I'm not going to
cross the line.

36:21.780 --> 36:22.712
We're talking about pizza.
I'ma leave it at your pizza.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.314
But I didn't eat your pizza.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.215
She's trying to start
some [bleep].

36:25.284 --> 36:26.449
I say I ate the pizza.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.817
- So tell me
some secret [bleep].

36:27.886 --> 36:29.019
You're one to tell me
something different.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.120
This is better than pizza.

36:30.189 --> 36:31.288
- I know but I let--

36:31.356 --> 36:32.889
- You got some secrets in
there.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.724
- Put it on me and I-I don't
want to call people out.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.227
- Oh, you won't call people out
but you wanna blindside me?

36:37.296 --> 36:38.995
You couldn't even tell me
I'm going in.

36:39.064 --> 36:41.598
That's what pisses me
the [bleep] off.

36:41.667 --> 36:44.534
- Obviously she's using
this whole pizza thing

36:44.603 --> 36:45.735
to open up the flood gates

36:45.804 --> 36:47.170
to telling me
how she really feels.

36:47.239 --> 36:49.639
And I'm like, "Listen, Amber,
there's a lot of people

36:49.708 --> 36:52.609
in this very room
that knew you were going in,

36:52.678 --> 36:54.444
so you should feel
betrayed by them, not me.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.046
I wouldn't like me either.

36:56.114 --> 36:57.647
- She doesn't like you.
- I wouldn't like me either.

36:57.716 --> 37:01.218
- You're being fake.
Hold on to your [bleep].

37:01.286 --> 37:02.519
[all speaking at once]

37:02.588 --> 37:04.588
- Bring Josh around.

37:04.656 --> 37:08.425
- No, do not grab Josh.
Leave him. Lock the doors,

37:08.493 --> 37:10.427
barricade him in,

37:10.495 --> 37:12.329
hit him with
a [bleep] tranquilizer dart.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.164
That's what we need
to do with Josh.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.665
This is not gonna end well.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.534
- I tried to call--
- You--so you can't apologize?

37:17.603 --> 37:18.902
- For what? I thought.

37:18.971 --> 37:21.304
- For what, y'all.
You blindsided me.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.039
- How was that a blindside?

37:24.710 --> 37:26.776
- How the [bleep] was that
a blindside, people?

37:26.845 --> 37:27.911
- Amber.

37:27.980 --> 37:29.846
- How the [bleep]
was that a blindside?

37:29.915 --> 37:31.881
Fessy, you want to tell me
that's not a blindside?

37:31.950 --> 37:33.550
You sat there didn't tell me
I was going in

37:33.619 --> 37:35.485
and you wanna tell me
I wasn't blindsided.

37:35.554 --> 37:36.886
- I told everybody in the
house.

37:36.955 --> 37:38.855
- Everybody in the house
but you didn't tell me.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.660
- Oh, what?
Sorry, I just fell asleep

37:43.729 --> 37:47.097
'cause Amber's still talking
about her situation

37:47.165 --> 37:48.732
about being blindsided.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.067
- So nobody told you.
How the [bleep] did you know?

37:51.136 --> 37:52.902
- You didn't tell me.
[bleep] you didn't tell me.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.171
- Here we go.
Bring a man to this equation.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.406
- Josh, Fessy.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.308
- This is it though.
This is it.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.377
- Ahh! I'm sorry.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.612
Amber,
you knew you were going in.

38:02.681 --> 38:05.949
- No, I did not.
- No, you did know.

38:06.018 --> 38:07.250
But you did know.

38:07.319 --> 38:11.254
You go around pretending
to be this perfect, loyal,

38:11.323 --> 38:12.922
nice, kind person

38:12.991 --> 38:17.327
and honestly, it's annoying
and it's childish.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.995
I'm sorry, Josh.

38:19.064 --> 38:23.400
She had a conversation with you
that she knew she was going in.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.869
- I'm sorry, Amber,
but if you don't want the heat,

38:25.937 --> 38:27.771
you better get the [bleep]
out of Esther's kitchen

38:27.839 --> 38:29.739
because that girl
is not playing.

38:29.808 --> 38:34.878
- You knew.
[all speaking at once]

38:34.946 --> 38:39.316
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no,

38:39.384 --> 38:43.486
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38:43.555 --> 38:45.488
- It was supposed
a partner thing.

38:45.557 --> 38:46.723
I had no idea what's
[inaudible].

38:46.792 --> 38:48.091
- Guy, this is [bleep] up.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.893
- Oh!

38:50.862 --> 38:53.096
- I have never in my life

38:53.165 --> 38:55.131
had a woman disrespect me
like this.

38:56.335 --> 38:59.636
Esther, what you just did
is [bleep] up. Fessy--

38:59.705 --> 39:01.204
- Don't talk to him. Don't--

39:01.273 --> 39:02.372
- What is wrong with her?

39:02.441 --> 39:03.973
- Don't talk. You knew.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.709
- Your partner promised
just like

39:05.777 --> 39:07.777
he promised Nelson last season.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.512
Stop 'cause
you haven't really--

39:09.581 --> 39:10.747
- This is what we're doing?
- Don't touch me.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.048
- This is what we're doing?

39:12.117 --> 39:13.650
- Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.552
- Oh! Oh! Get him. Get him.
get him, Josh.

39:15.620 --> 39:16.920
[all speaking at once]

39:16.988 --> 39:20.190
- You suck as a friend.
You got a big ass ego.

39:20.258 --> 39:23.293
You got a big ass ego
and you're [bleep] whack.

39:23.362 --> 39:24.661
Don't involve me
in your [bleep],

39:24.730 --> 39:26.363
Fessy, 'cause
I'll [bleep] dog you

39:26.431 --> 39:28.732
and I'll make you look like
the big bitch that you are.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.701
The one thing I've been
avoiding for the past few days

39:31.770 --> 39:34.738
is having this moment
with Fessy,

39:34.806 --> 39:36.940
but I can't help how frustrated
I am

39:37.008 --> 39:39.376
and how hurt I am
by the actions

39:39.444 --> 39:41.778
and just the way that he's kind
of been playing this game.

39:41.847 --> 39:43.580
Remember this.
Remember this.

39:43.648 --> 39:45.181
When the rookie-rookie game
is done

39:45.250 --> 39:47.751
and your ass goes in there,
remember this.

39:47.819 --> 39:48.952
- Josh, calm down, bro.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.321
- When the rookie-rookie game
is done

39:51.390 --> 39:52.956
and everybody votes your ass in

39:53.024 --> 39:54.624
'cause everybody's plotting
on your ass, remember this.

39:54.693 --> 39:55.992
- Who's gonna beat me? You?

39:56.061 --> 39:57.193
- Remember this.

39:57.262 --> 39:58.395
- You're gonna beat me?

39:58.463 --> 39:59.796
[all speaking at once]

39:59.865 --> 40:00.897
- You guys are brothers.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.565
You guys forget you guys
are an alliance.

40:02.634 --> 40:05.135
Alliance members don't do that
to each other.

40:05.203 --> 40:06.536
- You're the guy.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.405
You're the guy
that has the one [bleep].

40:08.473 --> 40:09.706
- Bro, Josh, the talent.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.307
- You're the guy--you're the
guy

40:11.376 --> 40:14.811
that talks the big game
but you haven't won [bleep].

40:14.880 --> 40:17.147
What have you won?
What have you won?

40:17.516 --> 40:18.648
What have you won?

40:18.717 --> 40:20.250
- This supposed to be
my best friend

40:20.318 --> 40:22.852
and now he's airing out
all my dirt to everybody.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.154
I don't know
what to do right now.

40:24.222 --> 40:25.989
You are the biggest
piece of [bleep]

40:26.057 --> 40:29.592
I've ever met in this show.
You [bleep] over Nelson.

40:29.661 --> 40:32.929
You [bleep] over Amber
and you [bleep] over me.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.297
- Fessy.

40:34.366 --> 40:36.266
Yeah, I know he's trying to be
this good guy this season,

40:36.334 --> 40:39.135
but don't get it twisted.
Snakes come out the woodwork.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.838
He got the name
Messy for Fessy for a reason.

40:41.907 --> 40:44.274
Do I agree? Hell yeah, I agree.
He snaked me.

40:44.342 --> 40:46.443
- You're gonna go home.
You're gonna go home.

40:46.511 --> 40:49.879
You're not gonna see the final.

40:57.722 --> 40:59.322
- The way he acts, I don't
agree with that.

40:59.391 --> 41:01.825
I'm just that big sister trying
to keep my brother sane.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.593
- It's a hole, it's a hole.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.195
[laughs]

41:05.263 --> 41:07.130
[all cheering]
- Damn!

41:07.199 --> 41:09.566
- She's got really anxious,
Josh.

41:09.634 --> 41:12.202
- Well, it's never good
when I come to the house.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.737
Never.
- Shut the [bleep] up.
