00:11.046 --> 00:14.641
Tonight, how much passion
can you get for L1,000?

00:14.716 --> 00:16.081
Oh, my God, the brakes.

00:16.151 --> 00:19.086
How much soul can you get for L1,000?

00:19.654 --> 00:22.885
And how much pain can you get
for L1,000?

00:32.834 --> 00:33.801
Hello.

00:34.970 --> 00:39.566
Now, most people who can afford
a really expensive car

00:39.641 --> 00:42.007
tend to be... getting on a bit.

00:42.077 --> 00:45.205
And the problem is
that most really expensive cars

00:45.280 --> 00:48.772
tend to be very hard, very fast
and very brutal, and that's a problem.

00:48.850 --> 00:52.445
I mean, if you're old and
you drive around in something like this,

00:52.521 --> 00:54.648
your wizened little head's gonna come off.

00:55.757 --> 00:57.725
Luckily, however, there's now a solution.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.760
It's this. It's the Bentley Brooklands

00:59.828 --> 01:03.229
and theoretically,
it's the perfect super-coupé

01:03.298 --> 01:05.322
for someone who has gout.

01:09.137 --> 01:14.734
Bentley say this is the roomiest
two-door coupé on the market today.

01:14.809 --> 01:21.578
It covers six postcodes. Its rear wings
alone are longer than an entire Smart Car.

01:26.988 --> 01:30.924
0f course, when you're driving it,
it feels very small.

01:32.294 --> 01:34.455
I don't mean small, do I?
That's the wrong word.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.929
I mean... enormous.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.400
Honestly, I was driving it
down a sort of normal B road the other day

01:42.470 --> 01:46.201
and it gave me some idea of what
it would be like to try and park the moon.

01:46.942 --> 01:51.379
But strangely, it's not the size
that overwhelms you most of all.

01:51.446 --> 01:53.607
It's the attention to detail.

01:54.716 --> 01:57.310
On average, it takes a swarm of robots

01:57.385 --> 02:00.616
about nine hours
to make a small hatchback like this.

02:01.590 --> 02:05.788
With the Bentley, though,
things are... a bit different.

02:07.562 --> 02:10.497
The whole back end
has to be assembled by hand

02:10.565 --> 02:15.264
because the shape is just too complex
for a machine to understand.

02:15.971 --> 02:18.439
16 cows had to lay down their lives

02:18.506 --> 02:21.168
to produce enough leather for this one car.

02:21.243 --> 02:25.373
And it takes 125 hours
to stitch it all together.

02:25.447 --> 02:28.780
It takes two days to polish
all the stainless steel trim-pieces

02:28.850 --> 02:32.616
and 130 hours to make the roof lining.

02:33.989 --> 02:37.618
Honestly, it probably would have been
easier to just take Blenheim Palace

02:37.692 --> 02:39.660
and put some wheels on it.

02:40.528 --> 02:43.895
To make the carpet,
16 sheeps had to have a haircut.

02:43.965 --> 02:49.494
And for the dashboard, 107 square feet
of 80-year-old walnut was needed.

02:51.339 --> 02:55.673
The upshot is that it takes 14 times longer
to make a Brooklands

02:55.744 --> 02:58.645
than it does a normal L10,000 hatchback.

02:58.713 --> 03:04.015
So you'd expect it
to cost 14 times more - L140,000.

03:04.753 --> 03:08.985
But in fact,
it costs getting on for L240,000.

03:09.057 --> 03:11.355
And that's before you start
with the options list.

03:12.994 --> 03:15.986
The special flying-B bonnet emblem,
for instance,

03:16.064 --> 03:18.828
is L2,136.

03:19.567 --> 03:23.526
Ceramic brakes
are getting on for L20,000.

03:25.940 --> 03:27.908
It is therefore very expensive,

03:27.976 --> 03:30.638
but then it is very special.

03:33.281 --> 03:36.375
In a normal supercar you get
to where you're going very quickly.

03:36.451 --> 03:39.750
In this, it feels like you've arrived

03:39.821 --> 03:41.846
before you've set off.

03:42.991 --> 03:45.755
You really do feel,
when you're in a Brooklands,

03:45.827 --> 03:48.887
that you are completely isolated
from the rest of the world.

03:49.798 --> 03:52.164
And that's because... you are.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.634
Let me give you an example
of what I'm on about, OK?

03:55.704 --> 03:57.331
When we're down at the track,

03:57.405 --> 04:00.431
I'm always given a walkie-talkie
so I can talk to the crew.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.533
And they always work fine,
never miss a beat.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.170
But in this, you can't get a signal.

04:05.246 --> 04:06.543
Hello?

04:06.614 --> 04:09.242
It doesn't work. Hello?

04:11.419 --> 04:12.818
Hello?

04:14.122 --> 04:18.024
I see what they mean
about it being erm... lonely at the top.

04:21.663 --> 04:26.157
So there we are. A quiet and spacious
sensory-deprivation tank

04:26.234 --> 04:30.671
for rich old people who want to
dawdle around in great comfort

04:30.739 --> 04:35.108
in a car which has
the same top speed as the Vatican.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.406
So, what, you may be wondering,

04:41.483 --> 04:43.849
is it doing with a Sport button?

04:45.120 --> 04:48.521
I mean, that's as stupid as
putting a Sport button on the Albert Hall.

04:50.625 --> 04:53.822
The thing is, though,
this car needs a Sport button

04:53.895 --> 04:57.331
because of the monster
that lives under the bonnet.

05:01.035 --> 05:02.935
Waaa! Ha-ha!

05:03.004 --> 05:07.031
Designed to run on coal
in the reign of King Edward II,

05:07.108 --> 05:09.599
this six-and-three-quarter liter V8

05:09.677 --> 05:13.545
was originally meant to produce
no more than 200 horsepower.

05:14.716 --> 05:19.779
In the Brooklands, though,
it's producing 530 horsepower.

05:19.854 --> 05:23.119
And, if you use
the Continental measuring system,

05:23.191 --> 05:25.659
more than 1,000 torques.

05:27.996 --> 05:30.464
The effect is profound.

05:31.232 --> 05:33.132
Listen to that.

05:35.036 --> 05:40.303
That is the sort of sound scientists create
when they want to set off earthquakes.

05:41.476 --> 05:43.876
You drive one of these things
through California,

05:43.945 --> 05:46.778
San Francisco is gonna end up in the sea.

05:48.716 --> 05:52.743
0f course, it isn't the most delicate car
in the world.

05:53.755 --> 05:55.052
Oh, my God.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.700
I am going sideways.

06:06.768 --> 06:10.169
I am para-sliding a Georgian tallboy.

06:17.011 --> 06:20.208
This isn't driving. This is naval warfare.

06:20.281 --> 06:23.114
What you do is turn in, make smoke

06:23.184 --> 06:26.517
and then turn... to face the enemy.

06:26.588 --> 06:29.113
Aha! You see, you weren't ready for that.

06:42.871 --> 06:47.240
You don't... wonder
at how it does what it does.

06:47.308 --> 06:50.800
You just marvel at the fact
that it can do it at all.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.214
Sure, compared to other supercars

06:54.282 --> 06:58.218
its top speed of 185 is not that fast.

07:02.557 --> 07:05.958
The thing is, though,
you can't compare it to other supercars.

07:06.027 --> 07:09.463
This is a huge slab of Old England.

07:10.331 --> 07:12.731
You've got to compare it to Edward Elgar.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.995
And he couldn't do 185.

07:17.539 --> 07:19.803
You have to love the Brooklands,

07:19.874 --> 07:23.867
right up to the moment
when it all goes horribly wrong.

07:33.655 --> 07:37.523
Ah. I think one of the tires
may have just let go.

07:42.397 --> 07:45.662
This is what we call,
in the world of filming, a wrap.

07:50.872 --> 07:52.339
- What?
- Well...

07:52.407 --> 07:53.601
What?

07:53.675 --> 07:56.337
Well, I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what.

07:56.411 --> 07:58.675
Look what you did to the tire.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.579
- Look.
- No. It wasn't me.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.048
No, it wasn't.

08:03.117 --> 08:06.883
You see, the thing is, you know you turn
the traction control off in a car, OK?

08:06.955 --> 08:08.479
- James doesn't.
- No, James doesn't.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.990
But a normal person
turns the traction control off.

08:11.059 --> 08:13.357
The problem is, this has so much torque

08:13.428 --> 08:15.760
that if you even gently
put your foot on the throttle

08:15.830 --> 08:17.821
it just spins the rear tires.
That's the result.

08:17.899 --> 08:20.595
No, that's because
you were driving like an animal out there.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.193
No. I had a blow-out, right?

08:23.271 --> 08:26.763
And that... that's a point.
I had a blow-out. I held it.

08:26.841 --> 08:31.278
I didn't go on Fern and Phil's sofa,
talking about my near-death experience.

08:31.346 --> 08:33.644
- Yeah...
- I took it like a man, frankly.

08:34.582 --> 08:37.813
All right. All right. Can we find out
how fast it goes round the track?

08:37.885 --> 08:40.115
No. No, there's no point, honestly.

08:40.188 --> 08:41.450
A car like this, you may as well

08:41.522 --> 08:43.990
put the Stig in the studio
and see how fast that goes round.

08:44.058 --> 08:46.356
So, what we're gonna do instead
is the news.

08:46.427 --> 08:48.258
Well, we'll do the news in a minute,

08:48.329 --> 08:51.264
cos first I want to say
a couple more things about that Bentley.

08:51.332 --> 08:54.358
You said there
it was like a slab of Old England.

08:54.435 --> 08:55.402
Yes.

08:55.470 --> 08:58.200
- But... Bentley is owned by VW.
- Yeah.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.069
That car was styled by a Belgian

09:00.141 --> 09:02.666
and it was engineered by
a man called Ulrich Eichhorn.

09:02.744 --> 09:04.712
It doesn't sound very British, does it?

09:04.779 --> 09:07.805
Are you presenting Top Gear or
writing a letter to the Daily Telegraph?

09:07.882 --> 09:10.908
Well, I'm just saying that you know
immediately that that car is German

09:10.985 --> 09:14.648
cos it's got too much power.
They've overdone it, as usual.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.748
Like they did
on their French holiday in 1939.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.219
James, the Queen is German
but you don't sing

09:21.295 --> 09:25.197
"Deutschland, Deutschland, über alles"
every time she comes on the television.

09:25.266 --> 09:26.324
- I do, actually.
- Yeah, he does.

09:28.136 --> 09:29.228
I'm going to do the news, OK?

11:51.003 --> 11:54.097
You know the erm...
the campaign we're having

11:54.173 --> 11:56.869
to get rid of stupid, unnecessary signs?

11:56.943 --> 11:59.969
Lots of people have been
very kindly sending in examples.

12:00.046 --> 12:01.843
Check this one out.

12:01.914 --> 12:04.610
If you look...

12:05.585 --> 12:09.544
If they hadn't put the sign there,
he wouldn't have hit anything.

12:09.622 --> 12:14.252
Don't put unnecessary signs
at the side of the road. Please, stop it.

12:14.327 --> 12:16.420
We're doing this to shame the councils

12:16.496 --> 12:19.294
that put these things up
without thinking about it.

12:19.365 --> 12:22.823
My favorite sign of the week,
sent in by a viewer - here it is.

12:26.038 --> 12:30.031
- Why? What for?
- It's not even true.

12:30.109 --> 12:32.168
- Is it?
- Shall I tell you something incredible?

12:32.245 --> 12:36.045
You know these new eco-signs? They've
got their own little windmills, solar panels.

12:36.115 --> 12:38.811
- D'you know how much they cost?
- 3,000 quid.

12:38.885 --> 12:40.944
L10,000. Of our money.

12:41.020 --> 12:47.050
L10,000. And, by law, there has to be
a conventional sign next to them,

12:47.126 --> 12:49.754
saying the same thing
for when it's dark and not windy.

12:49.829 --> 12:52.798
Which makes the L10,000 sign
completely pointless.

12:52.865 --> 12:56.892
Yes. If you're going to be eco, don't put
the bloody sign there in the first place.

12:58.137 --> 13:01.106
- We are being governed by imbeciles.
- Yeah.

13:01.174 --> 13:03.039
- Hey, go on, more news.
- Yes.

13:03.109 --> 13:05.077
VW has announced the new Scirocco.

13:05.144 --> 13:07.374
We've got one in the studio.
It's actually over there.

13:07.447 --> 13:09.677
You've got to admit
it's a very good-looking thing.

13:09.749 --> 13:12.274
- Looks like the Stig's helmet.
- In white, yeah.

13:12.351 --> 13:15.616
- It really does.
- Basically, it's a Golf GTi.

13:15.688 --> 13:17.656
But it's got fancier suspension underneath

13:17.723 --> 13:20.658
and this great-looking coupé body
over the top. It's a fab thing.

13:20.726 --> 13:22.057
But here's the point.

13:22.128 --> 13:26.622
- It actually costs the same as a Golf GTi.
- The same?

13:26.699 --> 13:29.691
Well, yeah, it's 150 quid more
but you get more kit as standard

13:29.769 --> 13:31.828
so it works out the same, which... How...

13:31.904 --> 13:33.929
VW have got a bit of a history of this

13:34.006 --> 13:35.837
because the Bugatti Veyron,
which is a VW...

13:35.908 --> 13:38.900
They did. That cost them
L5 million to make

13:38.978 --> 13:41.879
and they sold it for 850 grand a pop.

13:41.948 --> 13:44.542
I don't think
they've got the best accountants.

13:44.617 --> 13:46.812
They must go, "Why do we keep
losing money every year?"

13:46.886 --> 13:47.944
"How does it happen?"

13:48.020 --> 13:50.511
I suppose if you actually wanted
to save money, though,

13:50.590 --> 13:54.185
you shouldn't buy either of those,
you could just buy the Seat Leon,

13:54.260 --> 13:56.387
cos that is actually a VW Golf underneath.

13:56.462 --> 13:58.430
Same underneath.
No. No.

13:58.498 --> 14:00.966
It's got a version of the same engine,
which is more powerful

14:01.033 --> 14:02.557
and costs less than either of them.

14:02.635 --> 14:05.832
- You can't buy that because it's a Seat.
- What's wrong with that?

14:05.905 --> 14:07.998
- It's Spanish.
- What's wrong with that?

14:08.074 --> 14:10.235
I'm bored with Spain at the moment.

14:10.309 --> 14:13.745
Fernando Alonso in Formula 1,
he's the most successful driver there.

14:13.813 --> 14:17.544
He just is. OK?
Then you've got Nadal in tennis,

14:17.617 --> 14:20.984
they've won the UEFA Championships,
they've nicked our airports,

14:21.053 --> 14:24.113
they've nicked all our fish,
they've nicked all our building societies,

14:24.190 --> 14:26.988
they eat the heads off prawns,
they throw donkeys off tower blocks

14:27.059 --> 14:29.721
and they stab cows.

14:29.795 --> 14:31.956
- So that's the Spanish.
- That is the Spanish.

14:32.698 --> 14:34.757
- Anybody from Spain here?
- Yes.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.859
Give me my fish back.

14:38.304 --> 14:39.601
- Great news.
- What?

14:39.672 --> 14:41.537
The Dac... The...

14:42.775 --> 14:44.470
They know what it is.

14:47.013 --> 14:51.211
The Dacia Sandero has gone on sale
in the left-hand-drive market.

14:51.284 --> 14:53.377
Nice. Now, just one more thing.

14:53.452 --> 14:54.976
Did you see the papers this week

14:55.054 --> 14:57.955
about Prince Charles
running his DB6, his Aston, on wine?

14:58.024 --> 14:59.048
- Yes, I did.
- Yes.

14:59.926 --> 15:03.555
- Why doesn't he use petrol?
- It's not like there aren't petrol stations.

15:03.629 --> 15:06.257
- It's cheaper and everything.
- I don't get it.

15:06.332 --> 15:07.799
- What?
- Waste of good wine.

15:07.867 --> 15:09.892
- Yes.
- I know, it's a waste of good wine.

15:09.969 --> 15:12.699
Unless, of course... "Nasty whine
coming from your engine, sir."

15:12.772 --> 15:15.070
"Yes, I know, it's a South African."

15:18.144 --> 15:20.169
Er, right, that is the end of the news
and we're gonna move on now.

15:21.180 --> 15:23.705
I'm afraid there's been
a bit of an argument in the office.

15:23.783 --> 15:27.219
You see, us three, we maintain
that Alfas have a certain flair

15:27.286 --> 15:30.346
that you just don't get from other cars, OK?

15:30.423 --> 15:34.052
And that you can't be a true petrol head
until you've owned one.

15:34.126 --> 15:39.063
Yes, but the producers argue
that all Alfas are ugly little rot-boxes

15:39.131 --> 15:41.998
and you'd have to be
galactically stupid to buy one.

15:42.068 --> 15:46.368
So what they did was they gave us each
L1,000 to spend on an Alfa Romeo

15:46.439 --> 15:50.432
and then they told us to meet in a car park
near East Anglia,

15:50.509 --> 15:52.977
where we would be given
some challenges.

15:58.050 --> 16:00.143
I was the first to arrive.

16:01.287 --> 16:06.486
This is a 75, and I will admit
it is not the best-looking car in the world.

16:06.559 --> 16:09.926
It rather looks as though they got
themselves an Etch A Sketch to design it.

16:09.996 --> 16:14.126
And then they fitted the wheels from...
a grand piano.

16:14.867 --> 16:17.768
However, underneath,
that is a different story.

16:17.837 --> 16:21.136
The gearbox is at the back
for better weight distribution.

16:21.207 --> 16:25.735
The brakes - the rear brakes, anyway -
are inboard to reduce unsprung weight.

16:25.811 --> 16:27.779
It's got limited slip diff.

16:27.847 --> 16:31.806
And at the front
it's got Alfa's 3 liter V6 engine -

16:31.884 --> 16:35.479
I think one of the best engines
ever to go into mass production.

16:35.554 --> 16:37.522
And I got this whole car...

16:38.257 --> 16:40.725
for L450.

16:43.162 --> 16:45.027
It's... May!

16:45.765 --> 16:50.168
In a GTV. If you got this
for less than 1,000 quid

16:50.236 --> 16:52.227
I will eat my own shoes.

16:52.304 --> 16:55.239
Do carry on. L995.

16:55.975 --> 16:59.103
1996 Alfa Romeo GTV,
2 liter twin spark.

16:59.178 --> 17:01.442
And what have you bought? You idiot.

17:01.514 --> 17:04.278
- Did you just say "2 liter"?
- Yes.

17:04.349 --> 17:06.818
- Well, why didn't you get the GTV6?
- It's not as good.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.112
In what way is it not as good?

17:09.188 --> 17:11.588
Heavier at the nose
and the handling is compromised.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.647
- Cos it's front-wheel drive, this.
- Exactly.

17:13.726 --> 17:15.717
- And front-wheel drive is for the feeble.
- No.

17:15.795 --> 17:17.285
- This is rear-wheel drive.
- I know.

17:17.363 --> 17:19.797
- Racing pedigree.
- This piece... Think about it.

17:19.865 --> 17:21.560
...is to make Alfa look good again.

17:21.634 --> 17:26.162
This, as I just... This is...
In black, this is a symphony of evil.

17:26.238 --> 17:28.069
- It's not black, it's gray.
- It's black.

17:28.140 --> 17:29.573
- What's that?
- It's a... What?

17:29.642 --> 17:31.701
- What's that?
- Bird dirt.

17:31.777 --> 17:34.940
Yours is, I think,
a trial of style over substance.

17:35.014 --> 17:37.380
I can't even look at the front
of one of these cars

17:37.450 --> 17:39.782
because I get sexually excited.

17:41.787 --> 17:45.780
Mercifully, Jeremy was
interrupted by the arrival of Hammond.

17:45.858 --> 17:49.191
- Dustin Hoffmond has arrived.
- Hello, there.

17:49.261 --> 17:52.196
- That's...
- Behold... the Spider.

17:52.998 --> 17:55.762
- I knew you'd buy a Spider.
- I knew he would.

17:55.835 --> 17:58.702
This is the version
that only had one windscreen wiper.

17:58.771 --> 18:01.865
- No, actually, there is another.
- Like a Scirocco.

18:01.941 --> 18:04.774
This is the definitive
small Italian sports car.

18:04.844 --> 18:07.745
I couldn't believe you can get one of these
for a grand.

18:07.813 --> 18:11.249
- You know we're supposed to be...
- That doesn't always work.

18:11.317 --> 18:12.944
- It doesn't work at all.
- No.

18:13.018 --> 18:13.985
Let's start here.

18:14.053 --> 18:15.680
- Does the door mirror work?
- No.

18:15.755 --> 18:17.154
- Does this window work?
- No.

18:17.223 --> 18:18.884
- Any of those switches?
- Not really, no.

18:18.958 --> 18:20.255
- No. That window?
- No.

18:20.326 --> 18:22.055
- That windscreen wiper?
- No.

18:22.128 --> 18:25.996
- At least there's no play in the steering.
- That's all part of the character of...

18:26.065 --> 18:28.363
Have a look at the front wheels,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:28.434 --> 18:30.425
You could drive this
through an American movie.

18:30.503 --> 18:33.028
We could have bickered
until the middle of next week

18:33.105 --> 18:36.040
but the producers,
keen to show we were morons,

18:36.108 --> 18:38.906
were ready with the first challenge.

18:38.978 --> 18:43.881
"Back in 1743, Alfa Romeo
was indeed a successful racing team."

18:44.750 --> 18:46.775
See, they haven't got the idea of this at all.

18:46.852 --> 18:50.515
"We shall now see how much
of that racing pedigree has survived.

18:50.589 --> 18:54.286
"You will therefore go to a track day
at Rockingham race circuit..."

18:54.360 --> 18:58.592
- Ooh. I hadn't seen that one coming.
- You haven't seen this one coming, either.

18:58.664 --> 19:02.259
"...where you will get one point
for every car you overtake

19:02.334 --> 19:06.202
"and lose one
every time you are overtaken."

19:08.641 --> 19:11.201
- Ah.
- I may surprise you.

19:11.277 --> 19:13.108
I bet you I don't, though.

19:13.179 --> 19:14.840
- Right.
- Let's go.

19:14.914 --> 19:17.542
We saddled up
and headed for Rockingham.

19:19.018 --> 19:20.349
Well, two of us did.

19:20.419 --> 19:23.217
It won't work in a smooth way.

19:26.392 --> 19:28.758
The idea of a track day
is very simple -

19:28.828 --> 19:30.796
anyone can turn up with any car

19:30.863 --> 19:35.027
and spend some time blasting it around
as fast as possible.

19:35.100 --> 19:38.194
Be very conscious of the loading,
especially on this corner.

19:38.270 --> 19:40.397
Naturally, there was a safety briefing

19:40.472 --> 19:43.441
but, thanks to James, we arrived a bit late.

19:43.509 --> 19:45.272
...stick to your line...
- Sorry.

19:45.344 --> 19:46.902
- Sorry, everyone.
- Afternoon.

19:46.979 --> 19:48.446
- Sorry.
- It was his fault.

19:48.514 --> 19:53.417
OK, overtake either side. Stick to your line
and let the overtaking car get past you.

19:53.485 --> 19:54.679
OK. Everybody happy?

19:55.988 --> 19:57.114
Good, good.

19:57.189 --> 20:00.317
- What was the first bit?
- I think we may have missed quite a lot.

20:01.160 --> 20:04.789
Still, driving round a track -
how hard can it be?

20:04.864 --> 20:07.594
- Hammond, I'm gonna stick behind you.
- OK.

20:07.666 --> 20:09.930
Then I'm gonna take you on the straight
and get a point.

20:10.002 --> 20:11.060
I don't think so.

20:11.136 --> 20:13.604
- How many horsepower have you got?
- 126.

20:13.672 --> 20:16.470
- 190.
- They're all broken. They've got three legs.

20:16.542 --> 20:20.501
Right, right, left, left, left, right...
left, right, left.

20:21.747 --> 20:22.907
Straight.

20:24.416 --> 20:27.214
Ohh! Listen to that.

20:28.921 --> 20:31.651
0n the circuit
we got a bit of a shock.

20:33.726 --> 20:34.988
I'm minus one already.

20:36.896 --> 20:37.988
Bloody hell.

20:40.933 --> 20:42.628
That's minus three in one lap.

20:44.570 --> 20:46.731
Things were bad
for James and Jeremy

20:46.805 --> 20:48.466
but they were worse for me.

20:51.377 --> 20:52.173
What?!

20:53.379 --> 20:54.368
Aghhh!

20:55.447 --> 20:58.939
After three laps
of not overtaking a single thing,

20:59.018 --> 21:01.179
we scuttled back to the pits.

21:02.121 --> 21:03.088
Sorry.

21:03.155 --> 21:05.248
And there, the penny dropped.

21:05.624 --> 21:08.991
Porsche 911, another GT3 RS.

21:09.061 --> 21:11.928
- Lotus Elise, Porsche...
- Porsche.

21:11.997 --> 21:13.487
Porsche.

21:13.565 --> 21:16.534
I thought track days
were just for yobbos in...

21:16.602 --> 21:17.694
- Saxos.
- Yeah.

21:17.770 --> 21:22.503
Plainly, we had to think of
a way of slowing the opposition down.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.906
Guys, I've got an idea. Unnerve them.

21:25.611 --> 21:27.476
- Morning. What's that?
- A five.

21:27.546 --> 21:30.811
It's a five? They're the ones
that had the steering issues, didn't they,

21:30.883 --> 21:33.852
- when you were going really fast?
- Well, it actually...

21:33.919 --> 21:37.047
But d'you remember, when you went
really quick, how they used to jam?

21:37.122 --> 21:38.953
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, they did.

21:39.291 --> 21:41.122
Have you had
any of the problems with the...

21:41.860 --> 21:45.296
with the engine-compartment fire thing
that they went on about a few years ago?

21:45.364 --> 21:48.094
- Where did you hear that?
- We had it at Top Gear, on the track.

21:48.167 --> 21:50.158
Something to do with hard cornering.

21:50.235 --> 21:52.965
A GT2? They were the ones,
the discs used to...

21:53.038 --> 21:55.097
What was it?
The discs shattered under hard?

21:55.174 --> 21:57.904
It's always on tracks,
but anybody who's watched it,

21:57.977 --> 22:02.471
they say it's just the speed from
right that end of the car in, like, seconds.

22:02.548 --> 22:03.515
Yeah.

22:03.582 --> 22:06.107
It's more, they reckon,
an explosion than an a fire.

22:07.319 --> 22:09.310
So, did this work?

22:10.856 --> 22:11.823
No.

22:12.758 --> 22:17.695
But it didn't matter, because we had Alfas
and they were fantastic.

22:22.701 --> 22:27.365
Oh, that handling is... spectacular.
No other word for it, really.

22:28.807 --> 22:31.708
It wants you to drive it.
It wants to be driven, this car.

22:31.777 --> 22:34.439
Look at the vigor
with which it attacks this bend.

22:40.819 --> 22:43.515
Even Hammond
was looking on the bright side.

22:44.456 --> 22:47.084
It weighs just over 1,000 kilos.

22:47.159 --> 22:50.060
My Lotus Elise weighs
just under 1,000 kilos

22:50.129 --> 22:51.994
so... it's a Lotus Elise.

22:56.969 --> 22:59.096
Despite our enthusiasm, though,

22:59.171 --> 23:01.435
we still hadn't overtaken anyone.

23:02.307 --> 23:04.070
Oh, I've lost power steering.

23:05.144 --> 23:08.671
And the 75
was starting to suffer from Alfa-itis.

23:09.515 --> 23:11.483
When you put your arm
on the center console

23:11.550 --> 23:14.678
your elbow does operate
the rear windows. That is an issue.

23:14.753 --> 23:19.156
But it still has that Alfa magic
you can't ever really describe.

23:19.224 --> 23:21.317
Only Alfa Romeo owners know.

23:23.028 --> 23:25.223
What was that?

23:25.831 --> 23:28.595
Oh. Something's horribly wrong here.

23:28.667 --> 23:31.431
There's a buzz, there's a feel
that's different and odd.

23:32.571 --> 23:34.505
I had to make a pit stop.

23:35.140 --> 23:36.903
This is the thing you have to remember

23:36.975 --> 23:41.275
is Alfa build a car
to be as good as a car can be... briefly.

23:42.848 --> 23:46.249
That left it up to my colleagues
to defend Alfa's reputation.

23:48.320 --> 23:49.878
Oooh!

23:51.657 --> 23:54.751
Squeeze the power
through the long-banked curve.

24:00.065 --> 24:01.157
Edit.

24:04.303 --> 24:07.761
My flywheel bearings
sounded very poorly.

24:07.840 --> 24:11.606
It's an incredibly erm... complex job
to put a new one in.

24:12.978 --> 24:15.469
It's now quarter to 11 in the morning.

24:15.547 --> 24:19.643
I might be able to get a new one in,
if I had one, by about erm...

24:21.620 --> 24:23.611
...by about October.

24:25.591 --> 24:28.719
I therefore decided to cool it down
with a fire extinguisher.

24:28.794 --> 24:30.887
It was a brilliant idea.

24:30.963 --> 24:33.727
But then I got some bad news
over the radio.

24:34.633 --> 24:37.431
I've just been told something
rather interesting.

24:37.936 --> 24:39.597
What's interesting?

24:39.671 --> 24:41.138
While you're sitting in the pit,

24:41.206 --> 24:44.664
every car that passes the pit lane wall
counts as an overtake.

24:44.743 --> 24:47.143
Oh, for God's sake.
Can we hurry up with that jack?

24:47.212 --> 24:51.205
More to the point, Jezza, you're being
overtaken by me, consistently.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.426
Just overtaking you again, Jeremy.

25:01.927 --> 25:03.554
Shut up, Hammond.

25:07.599 --> 25:10.432
My flywheel was the first real problem
of the day,

25:10.502 --> 25:13.562
but soon they were coming thick and fast.

25:14.673 --> 25:15.640
Clutch.

25:15.707 --> 25:18.267
I'm going to the floor.
The brakes have just cooked.

25:18.343 --> 25:21.244
I think I'll just rest here,
let my brakes cool for a bit.

25:21.313 --> 25:24.282
- My brakes are shot.
- This is smelling bad.

25:24.349 --> 25:27.580
The driver's seat has collapsed
on the right-hand side.

25:27.653 --> 25:30.019
Is that water-pump gasket failure
or some sort of...

25:30.088 --> 25:31.521
- It's the pump.
- The actual pump.

25:32.791 --> 25:36.659
Then I tried to get a point
by overtaking Captain Slow.

25:40.632 --> 25:45.467
Naturally, that got us black-flagged,
but at least I took full responsibility.

25:45.537 --> 25:46.834
- You...
- That's the rules.

25:46.905 --> 25:48.202
...turned in on me.
- Rubbish.

25:48.273 --> 25:49.865
That's where you're supposed to turn.

25:51.410 --> 25:55.471
0n top of all this, the overtaking challenge
was descending into a farce.

25:57.249 --> 25:58.773
Oops.

25:58.850 --> 26:01.080
That's a 16-year-old boy
who's just overtaken me.

26:01.820 --> 26:02.946
In a Corsa.

26:07.226 --> 26:08.215
Cock!

26:10.596 --> 26:13.429
I'm gonna take a Gallardo Superleggera!

26:14.166 --> 26:15.861
Ye-e-e-s!

26:16.602 --> 26:19.230
Utter joy! Oh, wait, now he's gone again.

26:20.305 --> 26:23.331
Soon, though,
my disappointment got worse.

26:26.245 --> 26:27.769
That's not good. What's happened?

26:28.513 --> 26:30.913
Jeremy's exhaust
appears to have fallen off.

26:33.252 --> 26:35.880
That got me black-flagged... again.

26:38.724 --> 26:40.954
Ho-o-oly cow!

26:41.026 --> 26:43.927
There's nothing to worry about.
It's just the exhaust.

26:43.996 --> 26:46.794
It's Alfas. They do things
that you're just not ready for.

26:46.865 --> 26:50.426
A point that was proved moments later.

26:52.271 --> 26:54.239
- What's the matter?
- Clutch.

26:54.306 --> 26:57.366
Well, get it back up,
otherwise the producers will laugh at us.

26:57.442 --> 26:58.568
I know.

26:59.711 --> 27:01.338
Come on.

27:02.114 --> 27:04.082
I can hardly believe this.

27:04.149 --> 27:07.880
The only car that is out there
right now, working, is Hammond's.

27:09.755 --> 27:11.882
Well, when I say "working"...

27:12.624 --> 27:14.592
Please give me another cylinder back.

27:14.660 --> 27:18.096
Please change your mind back
and be a four-cylinder again.

27:20.932 --> 27:23.127
As we sorted out
our little niggles,

27:23.201 --> 27:25.396
the tally continued to mount.

27:25.470 --> 27:29.304
But even Jeremy was admitting
speed isn't everything.

27:29.374 --> 27:31.968
- Been overtaken much?
- There's Caterhams and Porsches...

27:32.044 --> 27:34.376
- Can I just say? They're fast.
- Yeah, brisk.

27:34.446 --> 27:37.381
Do they have the soul,
the character, the passion?

27:37.449 --> 27:39.212
If Katharine Ross -

27:39.284 --> 27:42.185
she of Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid
fame, and The Graduate -

27:42.254 --> 27:44.745
were to come here
and choose her favorite car,

27:44.823 --> 27:46.381
- it would be none of those.
- No.

27:47.359 --> 27:49.827
Finally, we were ready
to get back out there.

27:52.998 --> 27:55.228
And this time we had a plan.

27:55.300 --> 27:59.168
By working together,
we'd stop the overtaking massacre.

28:00.105 --> 28:02.665
Get alongside me, quick as you can.

28:04.676 --> 28:07.907
Yeah, now let's see 'em overtake. Ha-ha!

28:07.979 --> 28:10.709
Brilliant!
Why didn't we think of this before?

28:17.089 --> 28:19.990
- Have you been overtaken recently?
- No, not for a while, actually.

28:20.058 --> 28:21.821
No, neither have I.

28:24.896 --> 28:29.128
0f course, to stop anyone
sneaking by on the wider bits of the track,

28:29.201 --> 28:31.431
we had to weave about a bit.

28:31.503 --> 28:33.937
Oh, that's not gone well.

28:34.005 --> 28:37.236
0verall, though, my tactic
was working brilliantly.

28:37.309 --> 28:39.937
Until I was stabbed in the back.

28:40.746 --> 28:42.873
- That's a point for me!
- Oi.

28:46.785 --> 28:48.343
They've ruined the game. Now look.

28:50.122 --> 28:53.523
Back-stabber Hammond
was now getting very cocky.

28:56.395 --> 28:57.794
He fell off!

28:57.863 --> 28:59.660
Oh, no!

29:00.432 --> 29:01.763
Oh, no!

29:01.833 --> 29:03.630
Oh, I've got no engine.

29:03.702 --> 29:06.933
Brutus Hammond
was out with a broken water-pump

29:07.005 --> 29:10.304
and then it was the turn of Cassius May.

29:11.710 --> 29:12.734
No clutch!

29:15.313 --> 29:17.907
Meanwhile, for me,
things were looking good.

29:19.184 --> 29:22.676
Hey, it looks like we got ourselves
a slowcoach here.

29:22.754 --> 29:24.813
I'm gonna take the Focus.

29:25.590 --> 29:28.821
Come on! Come on, Alfa!
Show the world!

29:28.894 --> 29:32.728
Yeah, youth, how do you feel now?

29:32.798 --> 29:34.356
I've got a point!

29:34.433 --> 29:36.458
Oh, my God, the brakes.

29:37.068 --> 29:38.057
Whoa!

29:39.638 --> 29:42.300
- What's wrong with yours?
- All the water's coming out.

29:42.374 --> 29:43.807
- Is it?
- It's not good.

29:43.875 --> 29:46.275
- How's Jeremy doing? That's the thing.
- I dunno.

29:46.344 --> 29:48.335
Ask him, actually.

29:48.413 --> 29:52.179
- Jeremy, how are you doing?
- Not brilliantly.

29:54.453 --> 29:56.421
I think it's gonna be all right.

29:57.456 --> 29:59.788
I just need a tow-truck.

29:59.858 --> 30:03.658
Do you think they're A, going to be
sympathetic or B, be a couple of?

30:03.728 --> 30:06.561
- Nice work!
- No, they're going to be a couple of.

30:06.631 --> 30:08.565
- I'll tell you what happened.
- I'll tell you.

30:08.633 --> 30:10.828
No, a man came and pushed it over
when I wasn't looking.

30:10.902 --> 30:13.632
- No. You crashed it and it's on its side.
- I didn't crash it.

30:15.273 --> 30:17.207
No, look what you've done, man!

30:19.444 --> 30:21.639
- Yeah!
- Look what you've done!

30:21.713 --> 30:24.045
It's a minor scuff.

30:24.115 --> 30:26.174
Come on, car, don't let me down.

30:26.251 --> 30:28.742
Ahh...

30:30.856 --> 30:32.824
Doesn't sound good, that car.

30:36.595 --> 30:38.586
You can't kill an Alfa.

30:39.498 --> 30:41.625
You can't kill a 75, that's for sure.

30:42.534 --> 30:45.594
Anyway, look, we've now come back
into the studio

30:45.670 --> 30:47.501
because we've got another challenge.

30:47.572 --> 30:50.302
Yeah. We were each told
to make a calendar

30:50.375 --> 30:52.673
featuring our cars,
a bit like any of these,

30:52.744 --> 30:57.647
and then put it on sale for L4.99
at a top West London newsagent's.

30:57.716 --> 31:00.116
We'd get one point
for every calendar we sold.

31:00.185 --> 31:02.346
Now, I did quite a lot of research, OK?

31:02.420 --> 31:04.786
And I discovered
that what makes a calendar sell...

31:04.856 --> 31:06.448
I've got them here. Look.

31:06.525 --> 31:09.119
See what's in common?
Haystack. Haystacks.

31:09.194 --> 31:10.752
Haystacks.

31:11.930 --> 31:14.023
Girl. And...

31:14.099 --> 31:17.967
So I decided the best thing I could do...
was this!

31:18.036 --> 31:20.903
Wh... Hang on. Is that the car
behind the haystack?

31:20.972 --> 31:22.337
Yes.

31:22.407 --> 31:26.241
Cos I realized the 75 is not the prettiest car
Alfa ever made, so...

31:26.311 --> 31:28.279
I know haystacks are popular, so I did that.

31:28.346 --> 31:30.940
Well, look, here is your calendar
on the shelf.

31:31.016 --> 31:34.281
- How long was that on sale for?
- It's been on sale now for a month.

31:34.352 --> 31:37.321
- Right, and how many have you sold?
- None. Not one.

31:37.389 --> 31:38.617
James, how have you done?

31:38.690 --> 31:42.558
I decided that I wanted a really nice woman
to pose with my car for the calendar.

31:42.627 --> 31:46.028
So, what I did was...
wrote to some supermodels.

31:46.097 --> 31:47.291
What supermodels?

31:47.365 --> 31:50.960
Kate Moss, Sophie Dahl, the lot.
The big ones.

31:51.036 --> 31:53.334
- And how many replied?
- None.

31:53.405 --> 31:54.838
So, what did you do?

31:54.906 --> 31:57.136
Well, time was getting a bit short
and I was desperate

31:57.208 --> 31:59.540
so I rang up a local modeling agency...

31:59.611 --> 32:02.045
- What, in Hammersmith?
- Yes. We've got one.

32:02.113 --> 32:06.049
I said, "Could you send a model round?
I need one urgently for a car calendar."

32:06.117 --> 32:07.982
- Yes.
- And they did.

32:09.754 --> 32:11.551
James, that is a man.

32:11.623 --> 32:13.215
- That is a man.
- I know!

32:13.992 --> 32:16.927
But what could I do? He turned up,
he was excited about his big moment.

32:16.995 --> 32:18.622
I couldn't send him away, could I?

32:18.697 --> 32:20.528
- How many have you sold?
- None.

32:20.599 --> 32:21.964
Right.

32:22.033 --> 32:24.263
- So... it's all down to you...
- Yes, well...

32:24.336 --> 32:25.803
...to defend Alfa's honor.
- It is.

32:25.870 --> 32:29.966
I was clever. I decided I wanted
an action shot of my car for my calendar

32:30.041 --> 32:32.532
but we had to do it ourselves so...
Well, here I am doing it.

32:32.611 --> 32:36.308
I set the self-timer on the camera. That
gave me ten seconds to run to the car,

32:36.381 --> 32:40.477
get in, start it, drive past and get
a shot of the car moving, but I missed it.

32:40.552 --> 32:45.751
So I set it for longer, which gave me
more time to run to the car, get in, drive off

32:45.824 --> 32:47.792
and then... I missed it again.

32:47.859 --> 32:52.489
So then I thought, "If I change the line
and drive the car closer to the lens

32:52.564 --> 32:56.364
"I'll get a close-up shot of it
all blurry in action as it went past."

32:56.434 --> 32:58.459
And er... that... that didn't go well, either.

32:59.404 --> 33:01.133
Yeah.

33:01.206 --> 33:03.731
Did you actually get... a picture?

33:03.808 --> 33:07.539
Yes, I did. You see, I persevered
and er, there it is.

33:08.747 --> 33:11.910
That's the worst picture
I've ever seen in my life.

33:11.983 --> 33:14.918
It's action, it's blurry and
it's got a calendar on it and everything.

33:14.986 --> 33:16.544
- How many did you sell?
- None.

33:16.621 --> 33:20.057
Right, so... OK.
Er, let's put the scores, shall we?

33:20.125 --> 33:21.456
Er, how we're doing.

33:21.526 --> 33:25.257
Obviously, you get er... one point
for every tenner under 1,000

33:25.330 --> 33:26.991
so, James, you got a half.

33:27.065 --> 33:29.693
You got naught. I got 55 for that.

33:29.768 --> 33:32.032
Er, calendars. That's naught.

33:32.103 --> 33:33.400
- Naught.
- Naught.

33:33.471 --> 33:34.460
Naught.

33:34.539 --> 33:37.099
Er, overtaking. OK. Ready?

33:37.175 --> 33:41.168
James, you were... minus 203.

33:42.580 --> 33:44.241
Richard, you did well.

33:44.315 --> 33:45.714
- Minus...
- Ah.

33:45.784 --> 33:48.275
...178.
- Right.

33:48.353 --> 33:50.218
And me?

33:52.023 --> 33:54.321
Even though I got that Ford... OK?

33:55.226 --> 34:00.789
Did spend quite a lot of time in the pit
so I was minus 200 and... six.

34:00.865 --> 34:03.459
- Oh, well done.
- Bit disappointing.

34:03.535 --> 34:06.663
But don't worry. We're gonna pick this up
later on and all will be well.

34:07.505 --> 34:11.235
Now, though, it's time to put some stars
in our reasonably priced car.

34:11.309 --> 34:16.110
Now, we're often accused on Top Gear
of not really having too many minorities on.

34:16.181 --> 34:18.649
Tonight, though,
we have someone who's Welsh

34:18.717 --> 34:20.775
and someone who's fat.

34:22.454 --> 34:25.355
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome,
from Gavin & Stacey,

34:25.422 --> 34:28.187
it's Rob Brydon and James Corden!

34:30.261 --> 34:31.888
How are you?

34:31.963 --> 34:33.487
- Rob.
- Good evening.

34:33.565 --> 34:35.396
Have a seat.

34:36.067 --> 34:38.058
Look at this. Now...

34:39.204 --> 34:41.672
Obviously, you're a new boy.
You've not been here before.

34:41.739 --> 34:43.469
- Never.
- You, of course, have.

34:43.541 --> 34:46.772
I've looked after the new boy, sir,
and shown him round the dormitory.

34:46.844 --> 34:49.712
Have you? Cos last time you came,
you were super-quick.

34:49.781 --> 34:51.908
Yeah, but the worst thing
about the last time I came

34:51.983 --> 34:54.281
was my reaction
when you told me how well I did.

34:54.351 --> 34:58.379
I was like a child who'd been told
he'd been given a BMX. It was awful.

34:58.456 --> 35:01.789
And I think it's... Obviously,
Steve Coogan is a great friend of yours

35:01.860 --> 35:05.557
and you... And he's a big car head,
big petrol head. And you beat him.

35:05.630 --> 35:08.224
I've beaten him twice now,
cos he came back, didn't he?

35:08.299 --> 35:10.790
No, you were faster than Coogan,
which was very important.

35:10.869 --> 35:12.894
And how was it for you, then, today?

35:12.971 --> 35:18.432
It was good. Er... although I've never driven
a manual car before.

35:20.945 --> 35:23.846
I've... I've only got an automatic license.

35:23.915 --> 35:27.043
Cos your driving test wasn't that smooth
even in an automatic, was it?

35:27.118 --> 35:29.279
- No.
- Tell the ladies and gentlemen.

35:29.354 --> 35:31.720
Well, when I took my test,

35:31.790 --> 35:34.156
I... had nine points

35:34.225 --> 35:36.659
on my provisional license.

35:36.728 --> 35:41.893
I had nine points. I had a scooter,
which only went 44 miles an hour.

35:41.966 --> 35:45.163
But I drove it
at 44 miles an hour everywhere

35:45.236 --> 35:47.397
and got six points in one night.

35:48.506 --> 35:51.407
Plainly a fairly catastrophic driving history...

35:51.476 --> 35:52.943
Mm. No one's...

35:53.011 --> 35:54.979
...and yet a fairly smooth day out there.

35:55.046 --> 35:56.707
Unlike some people.

35:58.082 --> 36:02.041
Well, you see, the last time I wasn't
expecting anything and then did quite well.

36:02.120 --> 36:07.114
So I was very full of myself. So this time I
thought, "I can't be slower than last time."

36:07.192 --> 36:10.423
Who'd like to see Rob practicing hard?

36:10.495 --> 36:11.792
Yes!

36:11.863 --> 36:13.262
We've got some footage here.

36:15.099 --> 36:17.829
There we go. That was lap one, everybody.
There he is.

36:17.902 --> 36:19.767
360, lap two.

36:21.239 --> 36:24.072
Lap three. And lap four...

36:24.776 --> 36:27.336
And he's already on the grass there,
we should explain.

36:31.816 --> 36:35.980
So, two absolutely useless drivers here,
by the looks of it, today.

36:36.054 --> 36:40.115
But if I may, I'd just like
to talk about Gavin & Stacey. Fantastic.

36:40.191 --> 36:42.751
- It's a staggeringly good thing to be in.
- Oh, it's fantastic.

36:42.827 --> 36:46.024
You play this character
with a slightly ambiguous...

36:46.097 --> 36:48.622
sexual past, let's put it that way.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.964
It's interesting
what people read into it, Jeremy.

36:51.035 --> 36:54.232
I think it often says more about
the viewer than it does about the...

36:55.840 --> 36:56.807
James May...

36:56.875 --> 36:58.638
I find a lot of men
without a sexual compass

36:58.710 --> 37:01.201
are kind of wavering.
They don't know which way to go

37:01.279 --> 37:03.372
and they latch on
to that aspect of his character.

37:03.448 --> 37:07.111
And you two really racked up the BAFTAs
with it, as well, didn't you? I mean, cor.

37:07.185 --> 37:09.710
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Was it the Best... everything?

37:09.787 --> 37:12.722
Well, no, the show won
TV Show of the Year.

37:12.790 --> 37:15.258
- And then...
- Mm... well... it's all right.

37:15.326 --> 37:17.794
- It won TV Show of the Year.
- Yeah.

37:17.862 --> 37:19.830
No, it won it.
There's no other way around it.

37:19.898 --> 37:20.865
I know.

37:20.932 --> 37:24.891
And then I won... I won one for
a comedy performance on my own. Yeah.

37:24.969 --> 37:28.268
Did you want to be an actor from a young
age? Is that how you ended up being one?

37:28.339 --> 37:31.968
- Yeah, it's all I've ever wanted to do.
- But weren't you an underwear model?

37:33.711 --> 37:35.679
Well, I mean...
Anyone here read Heat magazine?

37:35.747 --> 37:37.442
We found this in it.

37:39.751 --> 37:42.982
D'you know what?
I just wish I'd stuffed my pants.

37:44.822 --> 37:48.314
You won't see me greasing up my torso
in Hot magazine.

37:48.393 --> 37:50.520
- Hot?
- I believe that's what it's called.

37:50.595 --> 37:52.495
Well, that was a very...

37:52.563 --> 37:54.895
Cos I have... I do...
Actually, I must just say this.

37:54.966 --> 37:58.060
Cos you make something
of the fact you're a larger chap.

37:58.136 --> 38:00.195
- I can't really ignore it.
- No, exactly.

38:00.271 --> 38:02.466
I find... I find the fatter person

38:02.540 --> 38:05.065
to be more entertaining company
than the thinner man.

38:07.645 --> 38:09.203
- No?
- You mean?

38:09.280 --> 38:11.248
I don't know if it's quite that cut and dried

38:11.316 --> 38:13.807
but you've had to create a personality
to get girls.

38:13.885 --> 38:17.446
This is it. I mean, you're Welsh.
Same thing, presumably.

38:17.522 --> 38:20.320
It's... It's a similar sort of holdback, yeah.

38:21.292 --> 38:22.850
Er... now, cars.

38:22.927 --> 38:26.693
Er, Rob, last time you were on you did
own up to a pretty shocking car history.

38:26.764 --> 38:30.256
Yeah, but since then I've had
an Audi A4 convertible, which is great.

38:30.335 --> 38:34.965
And I'm about to take delivery of
a brand-new A6 allroad.

38:35.039 --> 38:38.099
And I thought this was gonna
go down great with you and then...

38:38.176 --> 38:41.339
- Then you hear this.
...they tell me you're down on da Audis.

38:41.412 --> 38:43.539
No, we've moved them
down the board, I'm afraid.

38:43.614 --> 38:46.708
- Why?
- Because the... cocks, let's be honest,

38:46.784 --> 38:49.947
who used to have BMWs,
have now moved and they're all in Audis.

38:50.021 --> 38:52.819
Well, I never had a BM...
I never had a BMW. I...

38:53.858 --> 38:55.519
- I...
- Have you got a?

38:55.593 --> 38:59.393
- I don't drive an Audi. I would like one.
- He drives a salesman's Mercedes.

38:59.464 --> 39:03.696
A regional-rep Mercedes who's up and
down the M1 with his samples in the back.

39:03.768 --> 39:05.201
That's not true.

39:05.269 --> 39:07.601
- You've got your samples up front.
- It's a coupé.

39:08.673 --> 39:12.268
It's a coupé but I don't like it.
I've got a Mer... I've got a C180 coupé

39:12.343 --> 39:14.777
and I don't really like it,
so I want to get another car.

39:14.846 --> 39:18.748
- So I was gonna get an A5 or an S3.
- They're nice. The A5s are nice.

39:18.816 --> 39:20.909
- The A5's a beautiful car.
- A lovely shape.

39:20.985 --> 39:23.283
I've never seen one.
I'm absolutely convinced

39:23.354 --> 39:25.322
Audi just made one for the adverts

39:25.390 --> 39:27.187
and they've never actually
put it into p...

39:27.258 --> 39:30.455
I was sat in one the other day
in a showroom.

39:30.528 --> 39:32.894
- You've got to get out more.
- Yeah, come on, man.

39:32.964 --> 39:35.660
- You've seen it...
- Come down from your ivory tower.

39:35.733 --> 39:37.564
You've seen one.

39:37.635 --> 39:40.832
Erm, now we ought really
to have a look at your laps, I guess.

39:40.905 --> 39:42.372
- I'd love to.
- All right. OK.

39:42.440 --> 39:47.139
OK, well, now we're gonna see... I think
we're gonna see your lap first, Rob.

39:47.211 --> 39:49.736
That means he was faster
cos you're saving the faster one.

39:49.814 --> 39:51.543
- Goodbye.
- There's no way I'm faster.

39:51.616 --> 39:54.380
- I can't drive a manual car.
- It's like you are worried about this.

39:54.452 --> 39:56.750
- He is.
- Course I'm worried about it.

39:56.821 --> 39:59.790
Rob, you're first. Here we go.

39:59.857 --> 40:03.623
- 0h, it's wet. It's wet out there.
- It's taking a while to get a grip.

40:03.694 --> 40:05.855
Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.

40:05.930 --> 40:10.560
Theoretically, this car is a little bit quicker
than the old Liana. Here we go.

40:10.635 --> 40:12.933
- 0h, that looks slow.
- No, but it's a nice line.

40:13.004 --> 40:16.064
- That's good.
- Is it? "0h... he's gonna hit me."

40:16.140 --> 40:17.937
- That's good.
- That is good.

40:18.009 --> 40:19.169
It is good, isn't it?

40:19.243 --> 40:20.835
Oh, I slowed down there.

40:22.113 --> 40:24.638
That's the face
of a man who's concentrating.

40:25.750 --> 40:28.685
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on. Come on.

40:28.753 --> 40:31.449
- You're so keen!
- Well, you wanna do well.

40:31.522 --> 40:34.719
- Into the... Well, I'm really impressed.
- It looks really slow to me.

40:34.792 --> 40:37.920
Everybody says that but it isn't.
You can even see the understeer there.

40:37.995 --> 40:40.156
You held it nicely. That's looking good.

40:40.231 --> 40:42.028
00h, that's not looking so good.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.291
Have you driven a manual before?

40:46.671 --> 40:47.899
Yesl

40:47.972 --> 40:50.338
Ooh, I'm already thinking about the end.

40:51.109 --> 40:54.237
This is it. Did you manage to get through?
00h, you've slowed right down.

40:54.312 --> 40:57.213
- Oh, that's rubbish.
- What's the matter? Is it broken?

40:57.281 --> 40:59.613
- 0h, don't be like that. 0h, look at that.
- Come onl

40:59.684 --> 41:02.016
- That's... 0h, nol
- 0h, dearie me.

41:02.086 --> 41:04.384
Oh, no! Oh, that's terrible.

41:04.455 --> 41:06.184
That was awful.

41:10.828 --> 41:12.989
Oh, that was a dreadful finish, wasn't it?

41:13.064 --> 41:14.622
Yeah, pretty slow.

41:14.699 --> 41:17.167
Which means... new boy...

41:18.035 --> 41:20.970
that you're in with a chance here.
Shall we see his lap?

41:21.038 --> 41:22.665
Yes.

41:22.740 --> 41:25.140
Here we go.
Is he gonna be reckless or hopeless?

41:26.344 --> 41:28.608
That's on the rev limiter there.

41:29.514 --> 41:30.981
Good start.

41:34.051 --> 41:37.646
0h, he's turning in for a corner that wasn't
there and then into the one that was.

41:38.689 --> 41:41.351
- Nice line. Much wetter for you.
- Just a bit.

41:42.093 --> 41:44.960
Is that third? I don't know.

41:46.597 --> 41:49.657
0K, through Chicago.
God, that's a brilliant linel

41:49.734 --> 41:52.168
- That's really good.
- Get in there, you bitch.

41:54.605 --> 41:57.369
Hammerhead.
Can he make this one good, as well?

41:57.441 --> 41:59.966
Yes, look, you've got the understeer
but not quite...

42:00.044 --> 42:02.342
Rob's got quicker reactions there.
It's the older man.

42:02.413 --> 42:05.974
Get in gear, you... That's fifth. That's third.
Agghhh!

42:06.751 --> 42:09.618
piece of manual car!

42:09.687 --> 42:11.917
Who drives a manual? No one.
They're.

42:14.792 --> 42:16.555
Oh, we can probably beep all that out.

42:17.528 --> 42:19.393
00h, nice. That was quick.

42:19.463 --> 42:21.556
And a very brave line, as well,
hanging the tail out.

42:21.632 --> 42:25.090
Now, you're coming up through here,
looking quicker...

42:25.736 --> 42:29.866
Frankly, looking... 0h, no, you've gone in
for a corner that wasn't there again.

42:29.941 --> 42:34.844
It's looking wildl And then... big smile
and across the line.

42:44.589 --> 42:46.614
So... who wants to go first?

42:46.691 --> 42:50.024
I'm thinking probably we'll put er...

42:50.795 --> 42:51.762
...Rob.

42:51.829 --> 42:55.230
I don't think it's good
because that really was a very slow end,

42:55.299 --> 42:59.702
so I would imagine I'm somewhere
just underneath Ronnie Wood.

42:59.770 --> 43:02.295
No, I'm lower. Oh, no. Oh, Steve's there.

43:02.373 --> 43:06.207
Steve Coogan is here. He made me put
an H on it cos he said it was a very hot day

43:06.277 --> 43:11.544
and for some reason, in his mind...
that slowed him down considerably.

43:11.616 --> 43:13.481
I don't know. I really have no idea.

43:13.551 --> 43:15.985
- Well, last time you beat him.
- Yes, I did.

43:16.621 --> 43:20.057
This time, you did it in one minute 50...

43:20.825 --> 43:22.952
1.7.

43:23.027 --> 43:24.654
- So...
- Steve...

43:24.729 --> 43:26.663
- He beat me.
- He beat you.

43:27.498 --> 43:30.365
- That's 1:51.7.
- Oh, no.

43:31.669 --> 43:34.229
But... it was wet.

43:34.305 --> 43:36.205
- It was wet.
- That's a very good point.

43:36.274 --> 43:38.003
Which means you can, if you see Steve,

43:38.075 --> 43:41.010
tell him that you would have gone
four seconds a lap faster than that.

43:41.078 --> 43:43.546
- So actually, most important thing...
- Oh, here we go.

43:43.614 --> 43:46.242
Here we go. To make it worse. Right.

43:46.317 --> 43:49.184
There's no way I can possibly
have done better than that.

43:49.253 --> 43:51.551
Because I was in fifth at one point.

43:51.622 --> 43:54.523
If he has beaten me,
I would like an official inquiry.

43:56.160 --> 43:57.559
- You did it...
- Go on.

43:57.628 --> 43:58.822
One minute...

44:00.197 --> 44:01.562
50...

44:01.632 --> 44:04.430
3.4.

44:05.169 --> 44:07.330
So give him a round of applause. It's...

44:08.572 --> 44:10.870
It's low, but it's wet.

44:13.244 --> 44:16.702
1:53.4 is down there.

44:16.781 --> 44:19.579
I bet if they did an automatic
I could beat Les Ferdinand.

44:20.685 --> 44:23.176
Anyway, look, chaps,
it's been absolutely fantastic.

44:23.254 --> 44:26.746
Thank you so much for coming on.
Very best of luck with all the new projects.

44:26.824 --> 44:29.019
Ladies and gentlemen, James and Rob.

44:31.629 --> 44:33.221
Well done.

44:35.800 --> 44:38.633
Now, earlier on, we were trying to prove

44:38.703 --> 44:41.831
that an Alfa Romeo
will put a bit of zest in your life.

44:41.906 --> 44:45.171
And the producers were trying to prove
that an Alfa Romeo will just explode

44:45.242 --> 44:47.335
and bring nothing but untold misery.

44:47.411 --> 44:51.939
And so far, we've taken
our L1,000 Alfa Romeos on a track day

44:52.016 --> 44:54.246
and we've made some calendars
out of them.

44:54.318 --> 44:58.550
But now we pick up the action at
the Top Gear technology center in Didcot.

45:00.791 --> 45:05.057
This is what the cars looked like
after their day at the track.

45:05.129 --> 45:08.030
But the producers
were showing no mercy.

45:09.100 --> 45:11.398
- Thanks. Here we go.
- It's a drag race.

45:11.469 --> 45:13.699
- It'll be reliability.
- It's a drag race.

45:13.771 --> 45:17.502
It's neither. "Your cars have been
entered for a concourse competition

45:17.575 --> 45:19.167
"tomorrow in Leicestershire."

45:19.243 --> 45:22.212
Concourse.
That's... that's like Crufts for cars.

45:22.279 --> 45:24.941
- It's all about presentation, isn't it?
- Absolutely.

45:25.015 --> 45:28.109
"The judges will be looking for
spotless originality.

45:28.185 --> 45:32.144
"In other words, your cars need to look like
they just came out of the factory.

45:32.957 --> 45:36.859
"So, before you set off,
you'd better set to work with the polish."

45:39.363 --> 45:43.993
Because concourse judges even
check the tire dust-caps for cleanliness,

45:44.068 --> 45:46.662
I had to mend the damage
caused by James.

45:47.405 --> 45:50.932
Not easy when spare parts
are hard to come by.

45:51.008 --> 45:53.841
If they're gonna notice dirt
on the inside of an exhaust pipe,

45:53.911 --> 45:56.539
they're going to notice
that one of my indicators is from a Metro

45:56.614 --> 45:58.081
and it's in upside-down.

45:58.949 --> 46:02.350
James, however, was loving this.

46:03.087 --> 46:05.180
In cleaning the car,
you sort of clean your mind.

46:05.256 --> 46:10.159
And all you have to worry about is,
"Is that bit there as clean as it could be?"

46:10.227 --> 46:13.253
No, it isn't. So let's improve it.

46:15.699 --> 46:17.064
That's on now.

46:19.036 --> 46:20.594
Leather food. Yeah.

46:22.907 --> 46:25.375
"Test an inconspicuous area first."

46:26.377 --> 46:30.473
I decided to respray my car.
But even this had problems.

46:30.548 --> 46:31.776
This is a nice color.

46:31.849 --> 46:33.817
You know that Skoda green?
I bought some...

46:33.884 --> 46:35.909
- You know when I did the police car?
- Yeah.

46:35.986 --> 46:38.420
- That's the only paint we've got.
- That's a lovely color.

46:38.489 --> 46:42.016
Although if you're gonna change the color
you'll have to be a lot more thorough.

46:42.092 --> 46:44.083
Like you have to do under the bonnet.

46:44.161 --> 46:45.788
- They'll n...
- They will.

46:46.864 --> 46:49.856
While Jeremy
carefully applied his new paint...

46:51.635 --> 46:53.660
Check it out!

46:55.272 --> 46:59.106
...I came up with a genius plan
to fix my ruined seats.

47:00.411 --> 47:02.936
Hoo-hoo-hoo, look at that.

47:03.013 --> 47:04.412
Yeah!

47:04.482 --> 47:07.007
Soon my new paint job was complete.

47:07.785 --> 47:09.548
The badge.

47:09.620 --> 47:10.814
Oh, God.

47:10.888 --> 47:13.857
And while it dried,
I went to check on the others.

47:13.924 --> 47:16.449
- What if we try on the other side?
- No, no, don't go in the car.

47:16.527 --> 47:19.155
- Don't put your hands on the car.
- Oh...

47:23.934 --> 47:25.629
Re-covering my seat, it's brilliant.

47:25.703 --> 47:27.762
- Out of what?
- Your jacket.

47:27.838 --> 47:29.806
- You! That is my jacket!
- Yeah.

47:32.910 --> 47:36.607
I am a bit disappointed, I must confess,
in how that's turned out. The front.

47:36.680 --> 47:40.116
The sides and everything look good,
but the front, it's very bad.

47:41.852 --> 47:44.082
To distract the judges
from the poor quality,

47:44.154 --> 47:47.851
I decided to go for
some non-original racing stripes.

47:48.626 --> 47:54.064
And I'm gonna tell the organizers these are
the national racing colors of Ecuador.

47:57.735 --> 48:00.295
As night fell,
things were going well.

48:00.371 --> 48:03.363
The cars were beginning to look
factory-fresh.

48:04.208 --> 48:07.473
Yes. James.
James, something I've done works.

48:07.545 --> 48:09.911
Yeah, and it fits perfectly.

48:09.980 --> 48:12.244
I, however, had one big problem -

48:12.316 --> 48:14.682
my water-pump was still broken,

48:14.752 --> 48:18.244
which meant I'd have to feed coolant
to the engine manually

48:18.322 --> 48:20.313
as I was driving along.

48:21.058 --> 48:23.549
- How does the bonnet go down?
- I haven't worked that out yet.

48:23.627 --> 48:25.151
Don't rush me. This is engineering.

48:25.229 --> 48:27.254
What if we make a cut-out in the bonnet
with a saw?

48:27.331 --> 48:29.299
They'll notice that.

48:29.366 --> 48:32.858
D'you think they'll notice that,
with this in the passenger seat?

48:37.107 --> 48:39.940
The next morning,
we set out on our 80-mile journey

48:40.010 --> 48:41.978
to the concourse competition.

48:45.749 --> 48:50.083
The track day
really had taken its toll on my poor 75.

48:51.288 --> 48:55.349
OK, I've got an alternator-failure
warning light, brake-failure warning light,

48:55.426 --> 48:57.621
oil-pressure warning light

48:57.695 --> 49:00.892
and the unmistakable sound
of a ruined gearbox.

49:02.366 --> 49:04.493
And that's what I like about Alfas.

49:04.568 --> 49:08.197
No other Alfa in the world
has all these problems... today.

49:08.272 --> 49:09.933
They have different ones.

49:11.442 --> 49:13.535
Take Richard's car, for example.

49:14.979 --> 49:17.641
Ergonomically, I think this system
is a little flawed.

49:17.715 --> 49:20.741
The handle could
fall a little more easily to hand.

49:21.986 --> 49:26.116
Then James tried to argue
that he had a problem, too.

49:26.190 --> 49:27.487
- Hammond.
- Yes?

49:27.558 --> 49:30.220
My heater's stuck in the fully-on position.

49:30.294 --> 49:34.287
That's not the worst problem
it could have, really, mate, if I'm honest.

49:42.172 --> 49:45.437
At the next repair halt,
Richard and I decided to show James

49:45.509 --> 49:47.875
what a real problem might be like.

49:47.945 --> 49:49.310
Ooh hoo-hoo!

49:49.380 --> 49:51.848
- Would you like the mature?
- I'm thinking extra mature.

49:51.915 --> 49:53.507
- One of each.
- That's brilliant.

49:55.753 --> 49:57.778
That's gonna smell poor.

49:58.656 --> 50:00.487
Cover his vent.

50:00.557 --> 50:02.855
It's actually just a huge cheese-grater, this.

50:02.926 --> 50:05.053
He's coming, he's coming. Quick. Quick.

50:06.230 --> 50:08.027
- What?
- Hands off car, please.

50:08.098 --> 50:09.656
Sorry.

50:12.770 --> 50:16.570
Back on the road,
our old war horses racked up the miles.

50:18.976 --> 50:20.637
We're coming up now to the Fosse Way.

50:23.614 --> 50:25.741
I can think of few greater pleasures

50:25.816 --> 50:31.083
than driving an Alfa Romeo
with racing stripes on this road.

50:32.089 --> 50:34.717
Sadly, though, my fun and everyone else's

50:34.792 --> 50:37.852
was spoiled a bit
because James was in front.

50:44.935 --> 50:47.426
How is Hammond's car still working?

50:48.205 --> 50:49.672
This is gonna make it.

50:51.275 --> 50:54.301
You see? Alfas are magic.
They're like wizards.

50:54.378 --> 50:56.539
But then this happened.

50:57.347 --> 50:58.712
Agh!

50:58.782 --> 51:01.342
Agh! That's a disaster.

51:01.418 --> 51:04.114
The handle's come off his water-pump.

51:07.124 --> 51:09.592
And then this happened.

51:09.660 --> 51:12.128
Oh... what?

51:12.896 --> 51:15.160
No, not now! Come on.

51:16.133 --> 51:17.430
Oh, it's on fire.

51:17.501 --> 51:22.837
Now, normally on Top Gear, our
motto is, "If a friend falls, leave him there."

51:22.906 --> 51:26.774
But because today
we were united against our producers,

51:26.844 --> 51:28.812
James came back to rescue me.

51:30.047 --> 51:31.674
Well, that's not right.

51:33.183 --> 51:34.673
Hammond.

51:34.752 --> 51:37.550
I have been rescued
and I haven't even broken down.

51:37.621 --> 51:38.713
Hello.

51:40.991 --> 51:43.585
Because James's car was in the best nick,

51:43.660 --> 51:45.651
he would have to tow Hammond.

51:46.630 --> 51:48.825
Thanks for the tow, mate.
I appreciate it, really I do.

51:48.899 --> 51:50.025
That's quite all right.

51:51.135 --> 51:53.000
Sorry. Sorry.

51:53.070 --> 51:54.059
Hammond!

51:57.741 --> 51:59.709
Beginning to slow for the roundabout.

51:59.777 --> 52:01.404
Taking up slack.

52:01.478 --> 52:05.346
- 140 yards.
- Got the slack. Got the slack.

52:05.415 --> 52:07.076
Ooh! Sorry.

52:07.151 --> 52:09.119
Sorry, sorry. I... Ooh.

52:09.186 --> 52:11.780
Sorry, mate. I was looking for
my headlight switch.

52:11.855 --> 52:13.152
I really don't know where it is.

52:13.924 --> 52:15.551
What? No! Mate!

52:17.928 --> 52:20.226
- What's happening?
- What?

52:20.297 --> 52:22.288
He's broken something, as well.

52:24.268 --> 52:26.065
He left me.

52:26.136 --> 52:28.104
- Would you mind?
- I can't. Listen.

52:28.172 --> 52:30.231
Well... But...

52:31.074 --> 52:34.100
- But you can't leave an Alfa behind.
- Ow!

52:34.178 --> 52:39.047
So the car that was dead had to be towed
by the car that was dying.

52:39.116 --> 52:40.708
Oh, listen to that now.

52:42.252 --> 52:45.221
That's a weird noise
for a car to make.

52:46.490 --> 52:49.721
- That's better. What have you done?
- I've gone into second.

52:49.793 --> 52:51.988
Second's nice. It's underrated as a gear.

52:55.432 --> 52:57.161
Oh, my God.

52:57.234 --> 53:00.499
From then on, it was downhill all the way.

53:00.571 --> 53:02.903
Except when we were going uphill.

53:02.973 --> 53:05.498
Hammond...

53:05.576 --> 53:08.443
...it's not going well up the hill.

53:12.282 --> 53:15.012
Here it is,
carrying its mate from the battlefield

53:15.085 --> 53:18.145
even though one of its legs is shot off.

53:18.222 --> 53:21.589
While Corporal May just abandoned ship.

53:23.160 --> 53:26.823
Happily, though, May was paying the price
for his desertion.

53:33.704 --> 53:35.763
That doesn't smell like the engine.

53:40.777 --> 53:42.642
Looking good. Stylish.

53:57.016 --> 53:58.313
Fondue?

54:04.122 --> 54:06.613
Despite my bearings being shot to bits,

54:06.692 --> 54:09.092
we were now near the overnight halt.

54:16.368 --> 54:19.735
- I don't believe it. I do not believe it.
- My car?

54:19.805 --> 54:24.037
That tired old Italian car
has towed its broken mate...

54:26.278 --> 54:28.246
James wasn't very pleased to see us.

54:28.313 --> 54:31.874
- How much damage has he done?
- Well, he's knocked the number plate off.

54:31.950 --> 54:35.317
- Well, it's not that bad.
- It's worse than it was...

54:35.387 --> 54:37.287
- You could buff that out.
...this morning.

54:37.356 --> 54:39.517
- Look what it's done to his.
- It's done more to mine.

54:40.325 --> 54:43.783
Actually, you... I should be cross at you.
Look what you've done.

54:43.862 --> 54:45.329
- How could I have done that?
- Look.

54:45.397 --> 54:46.887
You were behind.

54:49.067 --> 54:51.160
Sunday. Concourse day.

54:51.236 --> 54:55.935
And the fields were filling with
some of the best drivers' cars ever made.

54:56.008 --> 54:58.238
...the Alfa Romeo concourse...

54:58.310 --> 55:01.370
All of which were being hoovered
and dusted and polished

55:01.446 --> 55:04.244
and then hoovered
and dusted and polished again.

55:05.217 --> 55:07.685
Meanwhile, a few miles down the road...

55:09.054 --> 55:12.046
- I'm going for a second. Are you ready?
- Aaaghhhh!

55:14.793 --> 55:17.159
Sadly, James is not able to tow Richard
this morning.

55:17.229 --> 55:19.459
He's still in a bit of a mood over yesterday.

55:20.365 --> 55:22.697
There was a bigger issue, though,

55:22.768 --> 55:26.033
because the rules say all cars
must arrive under their own steam.

55:26.772 --> 55:29.707
So, just outside the gates,
we pulled over...

55:29.775 --> 55:31.106
There's every chance.

55:31.176 --> 55:33.542
...and Hammond bravely rang for help.

55:33.612 --> 55:36.137
Come on. Live. Live. Live.

55:36.214 --> 55:39.479
- Oh, that's a pretty car, the old GTV.
- Yeah, that is lovely.

55:40.852 --> 55:42.444
Come on. Come on. Come on.

55:42.521 --> 55:45.649
No, you've just bought a Fiat, mate.
You haven't got the idea...

55:46.558 --> 55:47.991
Begin!

55:50.362 --> 55:52.330
Now!

55:55.067 --> 55:56.728
It was hopeless.

55:58.370 --> 56:00.895
So we came up with a plan.

56:00.972 --> 56:05.375
James agreed to tow Richard,
and my car would hide the rope.

56:06.645 --> 56:08.977
"And how did the accident happen,
Mr. Clarkson?"

56:10.148 --> 56:14.050
At the entrance we had to bunch right up
to fool the marshals.

56:14.953 --> 56:18.445
We always travel together, so if you don't
mind us sticking together that'd be kind.

56:19.624 --> 56:21.319
Morning.

56:22.694 --> 56:24.662
No, no tow-ropes here.
Nothing to see here.

56:26.698 --> 56:28.427
There are some marshals at the gate.

56:28.500 --> 56:31.094
We need to move past them
as if everything is normal.

56:31.169 --> 56:32.500
- Up on the left.
- Up on the I...

56:35.707 --> 56:38.574
- Morning.
- Over on the right, next to the...

56:38.643 --> 56:40.440
Sorry. Sorry.

56:40.512 --> 56:42.537
Very discreetly...

56:42.614 --> 56:43.581
Oh...

56:45.217 --> 56:49.847
...we made our way to the judging area
and parked amongst our rivals.

56:52.023 --> 56:54.685
- We're competing.
- Yeah. Yeah. Erm...

56:54.760 --> 56:58.719
As... a man... of God

56:58.797 --> 57:01.925
you'd take it badly, I'm assuming,
if I were to, for instance, key it.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.401
Soon the judges
descended on our cars.

57:05.470 --> 57:08.598
We've got some serious marking to do.
Would you be able to open the bonnet?

57:08.673 --> 57:09.731
- No.
- No.

57:09.808 --> 57:11.776
What I want you to put in your mind -

57:11.843 --> 57:14.937
under that bonnet
is a burnished specimen of perfection.

57:15.013 --> 57:16.446
- So that's zero.
- Naught.

57:16.515 --> 57:18.073
- Your paintwork...
- Yes.

57:18.150 --> 57:21.278
Most of it is the same color
that it came out the factory.

57:21.353 --> 57:23.685
- It is.
- So I've given it er... two points for that.

57:23.755 --> 57:25.382
- Out of?
- 15.

57:25.457 --> 57:26.424
Two?

57:26.491 --> 57:29.517
No, no, we keep the engine in there.
Anything else you need to check?

57:29.594 --> 57:30.925
- Is that it?
- Er, boot.

57:30.996 --> 57:32.463
Yes, it's down there.

57:36.034 --> 57:38.332
- Does it clunk when you change gear?
- No.

57:38.403 --> 57:40.701
I... I did patch this one slightly.

57:40.772 --> 57:43.798
- Well, I didn't. I had an upholsterer do it.
- Right.

57:43.875 --> 57:46.639
- Do you have the original toolkit?
- Yes.

57:46.711 --> 57:48.076
- Can you show it to me?
- No.

57:48.146 --> 57:51.547
You can't deduct marks for the cheese.
I didn't put it there.

57:51.616 --> 57:53.948
- You should have cleaned it off.
- So let's call it eight.

57:54.019 --> 57:55.486
Yeah.

57:55.554 --> 57:57.522
- You've written "seven".
- Yeah.

57:58.390 --> 58:01.223
The judges retired
to tot up the scores.

58:01.293 --> 58:04.126
But truth be told,
we were already winners.

58:05.797 --> 58:08.129
You see, if we'd been in three normal cars

58:08.200 --> 58:10.760
this would have been
a drive across the Midlands.

58:12.637 --> 58:16.403
But these three old crocks
had turned it into an adventure.

58:17.275 --> 58:21.371
Laughter, mishaps,
friendship, memories, thrills.

58:23.315 --> 58:26.113
That is petrol head heaven.

58:26.184 --> 58:27.446
Hammond!

58:27.519 --> 58:29.578
And, as we've always maintained,

58:29.654 --> 58:33.886
the only way you can get there...
is in an Alfa Romeo.

58:41.266 --> 58:43.700
- We were right.
- Want one.

58:43.768 --> 58:45.759
Heart says I want one.

58:45.837 --> 58:49.568
Anyway, it is now time to get the scores
from the judges.

58:49.641 --> 58:53.771
- James, what did you get?
- Out of a possible 150... 74.

58:53.845 --> 58:57.372
74. That's nearly a pass.

58:57.449 --> 59:00.247
Now, I got... 23 and a half.

59:00.318 --> 59:03.685
Yeah. Which was the lowest score

59:03.755 --> 59:07.088
ever recorded in er... concourse history.

59:07.158 --> 59:09.217
Yeah. Until I came along.

59:10.095 --> 59:11.926
- What did you get?
- I got nine.

59:14.232 --> 59:15.722
- Nine?
- Nine.

59:15.800 --> 59:18.268
Nine points. So, here we go.
These are the totals.

59:18.336 --> 59:21.828
James, you are minus... 129 and a half.

59:21.907 --> 59:23.670
- Yep.
- 129 and a half.

59:23.742 --> 59:28.042
- Richard, you are minus 169.
- Yes, I am.

59:28.113 --> 59:32.743
And I'm minus 127 and a half!

59:33.518 --> 59:37.784
And so, for the first time since the
cheap-car challenge about three years ago,

59:37.856 --> 59:40.848
I've actually won something!

59:40.926 --> 59:43.156
Well done.

59:43.228 --> 59:45.321
- And it gets better.
- Why?

59:45.397 --> 59:51.029
Because, as a prize, the producers
have said you get to keep that 75

59:51.102 --> 59:53.730
and use it as your car for a whole year.

59:53.805 --> 59:57.036
And d'you know something?
Honestly, as a car lover

59:57.108 --> 59:59.269
I can't think of anything I'd like more.

59:59.344 --> 01:00:02.177
Er... so that's time to end now.
Thank you very much for watching.

01:00:02.247 --> 01:00:03.544
See you next week. Good night.
