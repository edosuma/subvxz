(DOOR OPENING)

33:05.276 --> 33:06.857
What's wrong?

33:07.361 --> 33:11.104
I don't know. I...
I kind of have
a knot in my gut.

33:11.532 --> 33:14.490
Oh. Then allow me
to untie it.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.946
You're the one
that put it there.

33:17.663 --> 33:21.372
Look, Hiro,
l was okay with dying.
Really, l'd accepted that.

33:21.458 --> 33:24.074
But this... Gosh,
this just feels
like cheating.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.285
No, it's okay.

33:25.379 --> 33:26.994
It's not. It's not okay.

33:27.089 --> 33:30.422
I mean, that man, Sylar,
you said he's gonna
kill a lot of people.

33:30.509 --> 33:33.296
| just don't understand
how you could
let him do that.

33:33.387 --> 33:35.969
You're supposed to be
one of the good guys.

33:36.056 --> 33:39.298
l... I had to preserve
the time-space continuum.

33:39.393 --> 33:43.386
You didn't.
You changed it.
You saved me.

33:44.607 --> 33:47.474
But this is our
happily ever after.

33:47.568 --> 33:49.650
We're going to Otsu.
Yay, Otsu.

33:49.737 --> 33:53.446
Hiro, 300,000 people die
every single day.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.524
Young, old.
There are accidents, murders.

33:56.619 --> 34:00.282
Why am | any different?
Why do | get to live?

34:03.459 --> 34:05.324
Because I love you.

34:05.419 --> 34:07.284
Then that's just selfish.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.516
Excuse me.
I found this on my desk.

34:26.607 --> 34:29.064
I guess somebody
delivered it by mistake.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.408
You planning on staying
at the Midland Motel?

34:50.589 --> 34:56.710
So, we're pretending
that we've never been
to the Burnt Toast Diner?

35:04.561 --> 35:06.722
Everything okay,
Bennet?

35:17.283 --> 35:18.693
Yeah.

35:20.869 --> 35:22.370
Yeah, it's my mistake.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.159
I thought
I saw you there.

35:28.961 --> 35:29.996
Have a good night.

35:30.087 --> 35:31.202
You, too.

35:43.309 --> 35:45.595
Beer, please. Root.

35:47.563 --> 35:49.895
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

35:53.235 --> 35:55.066
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

36:13.964 --> 36:16.171
"The course of true love
never did run smooth."

36:17.968 --> 36:19.424
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

36:36.445 --> 36:37.935
Charlie.

36:41.575 --> 36:43.907
Hiro, l was just
so terrible to you.

36:43.994 --> 36:46.576
After everything you did,
risking your life.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.574
You must think
something awful of me.

36:48.665 --> 36:52.249
Oh. Never. I understand
what you think.

36:53.754 --> 36:55.460
That I was selfish.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.216
And maybe I was.

36:58.675 --> 37:02.293
But I'm not. I know
the world is a better place
with you in it.

37:04.223 --> 37:05.804
Well, thank you.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.886
Thank you
for saving my life.

37:09.478 --> 37:11.184
Aw. Shucks, ma'am.

37:12.189 --> 37:14.100
It was no trouble.
(LAUGHS)

37:16.318 --> 37:18.434
Oh. Were you crying?

37:19.446 --> 37:21.482
No, it's folding paper.

37:22.616 --> 37:25.653
l was trying to make
1,000 origami cranes.

37:27.037 --> 37:28.823
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

37:47.724 --> 37:50.716
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

38:07.411 --> 38:09.026
Here, Charlie.

38:13.876 --> 38:16.743
Butterfly Man.
What's going on?

38:16.837 --> 38:19.544
I've done something
very bad, Hiro.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.876
What do you mean?

38:22.384 --> 38:25.251
I've taken Charlie.
I had to.

38:26.555 --> 38:29.217
Had to what? Where?

38:29.683 --> 38:31.799
Where have you taken her?

38:31.894 --> 38:33.509
Back to my carnival.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.933
Rather, fonNard
to our present.

38:40.110 --> 38:43.352
(CRIES) Why?
Why would you do that?

38:44.406 --> 38:47.864
To get to you.
It's all been
about you, Hiro.

38:50.704 --> 38:54.868
Take me to her.
Where is she?
Where is she?

38:54.958 --> 38:56.994
You're gonna have
to dig deep
and take control.

38:57.085 --> 39:00.213
You're gonna have to
take us back if you
ever wanna see her again.

39:00.297 --> 39:01.582
(SCREAMS)

39:03.550 --> 39:05.290
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

39:06.053 --> 39:08.840
You did it, Hiro.
You're gaining control back.
That's great.

39:12.309 --> 39:13.890
She's not exactly here.

39:25.781 --> 39:27.191
Charlie?

39:28.200 --> 39:29.565
Charlie.

39:30.869 --> 39:34.111
Have you seen Charlie?
Where is Charlie?

39:56.687 --> 39:57.972
(SIGHS)

39:58.397 --> 40:00.308
His name was Arnold.

40:00.649 --> 40:03.982
He was a time traveler,
just like you.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.025
His body couldn't
take the strain.

40:08.824 --> 40:11.315
He had a tumor,
just like you.

40:13.245 --> 40:17.659
The last thing I asked him
to do was to take
your Charlie and trap her

40:18.959 --> 40:20.495
somewhere in time.

40:21.420 --> 40:22.785
It killed him.

40:22.879 --> 40:24.210
(EXHALES)

40:28.635 --> 40:30.171
You're a murderer.

40:31.346 --> 40:32.461
Yeah.

40:33.307 --> 40:35.764
Tell me where Charlie is.

40:37.936 --> 40:41.178
If I told you,
there'd be nothing
to keep you here.

40:43.275 --> 40:46.733
You manipulated me
this whole time.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.359
You left me no choice.

40:48.447 --> 40:50.108
You got too much of that...
What do they call it in Japan?

40:50.198 --> 40:51.233
(SPEAKS JAPANESE)

40:51.325 --> 40:54.533
Honor. I respect that,
I respect you,

40:55.537 --> 41:00.156
but I had to do something
to get you to work for me.

41:01.293 --> 41:03.124
To fix my past.

41:03.211 --> 41:06.544
But why me if you had
a time traveler?

41:06.632 --> 41:08.042
(SIGHS)

41:11.553 --> 41:15.637
If anyone here found out
about my transgressions,

41:17.184 --> 41:19.721
all the good work I've done
would unravel.

41:21.355 --> 41:23.391
You are not
Butterfly Man.

41:23.899 --> 41:25.890
You are Evil
Butterfly Man.

41:33.909 --> 41:38.573
I'm the only one
who knows exactly where
your sweet Charlie is.

41:39.915 --> 41:44.534
And you can save her,
but only if you do exactly
what I ask you to do.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.872
I got my own butterflies
that need crushing.

41:59.434 --> 42:00.890
What must I do?

42:02.938 --> 42:04.474
I made a mistake.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.898
About eight weeks ago.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.366
Sorry.

42:19.454 --> 42:20.955
So sorry.

42:21.998 --> 42:23.863
(SIGHING)
