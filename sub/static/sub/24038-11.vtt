00:07.568 --> 00:10.136
Wyatt?

00:10.216 --> 00:11.970
Wyatt?

00:14.515 --> 00:17.176
Wyatt? Are you okay?

00:17.179 --> 00:19.144
Emma set us up.

00:19.147 --> 00:20.563
The pilot,

00:20.566 --> 00:21.848
he was working for her.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.832
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

00:23.835 --> 00:27.486
He's dead. You wrestled
the controls away from him.

00:27.489 --> 00:29.207
Still crashed.

00:29.210 --> 00:30.756
We would have died.

00:30.759 --> 00:32.159
You saved us.

00:32.161 --> 00:35.511
Rufus and Jiya.

00:35.514 --> 00:37.264
They're okay, they're
okay, they're okay.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.666
Are you okay?

00:40.669 --> 00:42.402
Yeah.

00:43.606 --> 00:45.639
- All right, come on.
- Okay.

00:45.641 --> 00:47.241
Ow.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:59.955 --> 01:02.022
- Does it hurt?
- Mm, no. The, uh...

01:02.024 --> 01:04.358
cold air, it's very numbing.

01:10.633 --> 01:12.132
Let me see.

01:15.237 --> 01:17.371
When'd you become G.I. Jane?

01:17.373 --> 01:18.957
Chinatown.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.574
My friend Molly taught me.

01:20.576 --> 01:23.043
Doctors were... expensive.

01:23.045 --> 01:24.457
Wonder what happened to her.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.759
She died.

01:25.762 --> 01:27.814
Bubonic plague. I looked it up.

01:27.816 --> 01:29.516
According to the chopper radio,

01:29.518 --> 01:31.518
Meredith Victory sailed yesterday

01:31.520 --> 01:34.588
with 14,000 people, just
like she was supposed to.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.590
So the pilot, North Korea, all of it,

01:36.592 --> 01:38.924
- was about her killing us?
- It makes sense.

01:38.927 --> 01:40.861
Emma wants to get us out of the way.

01:40.863 --> 01:43.764
Well, doesn't get much more
out of the way than North Korea

01:43.766 --> 01:45.932
- in the dead of night.
- Sleeper's dead.

01:45.934 --> 01:48.368
Only thing left to do is
find the Lifeboat and go home.

01:48.370 --> 01:49.936
Anyone have a one-horse open sleigh?

01:51.183 --> 01:53.206
Come on, it's gonna be light soon.

01:53.208 --> 01:56.376
This is officially the worst
Christmas vacation ever.

01:56.378 --> 01:59.012
And that includes the Chevy Chase movie.

01:59.014 --> 02:01.114
The protocol.

02:01.116 --> 02:03.340
They might have left
us a message, buried.

02:03.343 --> 02:04.876
Sure. We'll just go dig up

02:04.879 --> 02:06.621
a hole in the middle of North Korea.

02:06.624 --> 02:08.479
So what, would you
have us just do nothing?

02:08.483 --> 02:10.483
Just accept that they're
all gone? I can't.

02:10.485 --> 02:12.553
- I won't accept that.
- I'm not accepting anything.

02:12.556 --> 02:15.027
I'm saying we need a better plan.

02:15.030 --> 02:17.030
From what I found, it
looks like they were

02:17.032 --> 02:19.232
in a helicopter crash on the 24th.

02:19.234 --> 02:20.347
Yeah, Emma's doing.

02:20.350 --> 02:22.069
They survived; the pilot didn't.

02:22.071 --> 02:24.071
Thanks to our intrepid team, no doubt.

02:24.073 --> 02:25.939
What exactly happens on the 25th?

02:25.941 --> 02:30.177
They're killed by Chinese troops
in the massacre of Usang-ri.

02:33.102 --> 02:35.469
We've got to get to
them before that happens.

02:35.472 --> 02:38.452
Uh, how? We don't have a
time machine or a pilot.

02:38.454 --> 02:40.457
Rittenhouse has both.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.389
Yes, and I'm sure Emma would
be delighted to help us,

02:42.391 --> 02:44.391
if she wasn't the one
trying to bloody kill us all.

02:45.394 --> 02:47.260
So, this is weird.

02:47.262 --> 02:49.329
In my timeline, you
guys are still a couple.

02:49.331 --> 02:50.797
You think you'll get
back together, or what?

02:50.799 --> 02:53.511
Because I'm still totally
shipping team "Lyatt."

02:53.514 --> 02:55.222
What? What's that?

02:55.225 --> 02:57.470
You guys are like Han and Leia.

02:57.473 --> 03:00.006
Uh, Arwen and Aragorn.

03:00.008 --> 03:01.808
Bella and Edward?

03:01.810 --> 03:04.316
You guys have obstacles, too.

03:04.319 --> 03:06.860
Rufus, it's not like
we got into a fight.

03:06.863 --> 03:10.337
He was married to someone
else, who he thought was dead,

03:10.340 --> 03:12.165
who then all of a sudden wasn't dead.

03:12.168 --> 03:13.854
So he left me to be with her.

03:13.856 --> 03:16.123
And I know that you don't remember that,

03:16.125 --> 03:18.258
but it's not something
I'm going to forget.

03:18.260 --> 03:20.127
Well, apparently, I
came back from the dead,

03:20.129 --> 03:22.295
- so anything's possible.
- I hear that, but...

03:22.297 --> 03:24.131
I don't want to be
anyone's second choice.

03:24.133 --> 03:26.466
When you were kidnapped by your mother,

03:26.468 --> 03:28.268
we thought you were dead.

03:28.270 --> 03:29.870
We all lost hope.

03:29.872 --> 03:31.605
Except for Wyatt.

03:31.607 --> 03:32.839
He never gave up on you.

03:32.841 --> 03:34.274
He always swore you were out there.

03:34.276 --> 03:35.642
He tried to blowtorch his way

03:35.644 --> 03:37.462
out of the bunker to find you.

03:37.465 --> 03:39.980
I know there was a
Jessica, but he was willing

03:39.982 --> 03:41.448
to give her up to find me.

03:41.450 --> 03:43.183
And I'll tell you, the guy likes me,

03:43.185 --> 03:44.941
but if he had to give you up,

03:44.944 --> 03:47.199
I know for a fact I'd still be dead.

03:47.202 --> 03:50.022
Doesn't sound like a
second choice to me.

03:50.025 --> 03:52.192
Guys, look.

04:03.738 --> 04:06.039
- Where are they going?
- Hungnam.

04:06.041 --> 04:08.041
The last boats have to evacuate today,

04:08.043 --> 04:10.177
before the Chinese
army reaches the port.

04:10.179 --> 04:11.645
Or what happens?

04:11.647 --> 04:13.074
North Korea happens.

04:13.077 --> 04:14.699
Anyone who spoke out against communism

04:14.702 --> 04:17.683
or tried to help the Americans
was, at best, imprisoned.

04:17.685 --> 04:19.586
- And at worst?
- Beheaded.

04:19.588 --> 04:21.353
So, what about us?

04:21.356 --> 04:23.223
We need to keep moving.

04:23.225 --> 04:24.707
The Chinese just crossed the border,

04:24.710 --> 04:26.443
and they march dark to dark.

04:26.446 --> 04:28.613
We got to get to the
Lifeboat before nightfall.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.515
Otherwise, the communists
get a time machine.

04:30.518 --> 04:32.932
Which, incidentally, is my
least favorite Christmas movie.

04:32.935 --> 04:34.575
I'm not worried about the time machine.

04:34.577 --> 04:36.442
I'm worried about the
thousands of Chinese troops

04:36.444 --> 04:39.238
- between us and it.
- So, what are you saying?

04:39.241 --> 04:41.107
In all likelihood?

04:41.110 --> 04:43.277
We die.

04:47.573 --> 04:49.307
So, how long does this war go on for?

04:49.310 --> 04:52.795
Uh, war lasts another three
years, till the armistice.

04:52.798 --> 04:54.698
But nobody wins.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.254
North Korea shuts its doors.

04:56.257 --> 04:59.301
There are families who haven't seen
or heard from each other in decades.

04:59.304 --> 05:00.604
Hey, let's check out that car.

05:00.606 --> 05:02.272
Please, please be a car with a heater.

05:08.154 --> 05:09.182
Dead car.

05:09.185 --> 05:10.652
Well, I'm not exactly sure "dead"

05:10.654 --> 05:12.143
is a forever thing with us.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.195
Hey, with our combined
skill set, how long

05:14.198 --> 05:15.819
you think it takes before
this is up and running?

05:15.821 --> 05:17.804
- Rufus...
- Look, it'll be safer,

05:17.807 --> 05:19.623
faster and warmer with wheels.

05:19.625 --> 05:22.626
All right. Why don't you and
Jiya go get warm in the church?

05:22.628 --> 05:24.299
'Cause we're women and it's 1950?

05:24.302 --> 05:25.797
Because you're starting
to get frostbite.

05:25.799 --> 05:27.359
You'd look much prettier with ears.

05:27.362 --> 05:29.232
- Good point. Let's go.
- Okay.

05:38.910 --> 05:40.944
Sit there.

05:49.388 --> 05:52.989
In San Francisco in 1888,

05:52.991 --> 05:57.460
there was this beautiful
cathedral, St. Mary's.

05:58.117 --> 06:00.050
Rufus would probably think I was crazy,

06:00.053 --> 06:02.921
but it made me feel closer to him.

06:02.932 --> 06:04.734
I'm really happy for you.

06:04.736 --> 06:07.218
For both of you. I mean,
just to have him back.

06:07.221 --> 06:09.372
- I love him.
- I know you do.

06:09.374 --> 06:11.341
So much, Lucy.

06:11.343 --> 06:12.942
He loves you, too.

06:12.944 --> 06:15.211
He thinks he does.

06:15.213 --> 06:17.447
But he has no idea who I am now.

06:17.449 --> 06:20.583
What he remembers as yesterday
was three years ago for me.

06:20.586 --> 06:21.785
And I've changed, Lucy.

06:21.788 --> 06:24.255
I'm not the same person
he fell in love with.

06:26.892 --> 06:28.625
I'm scared I never will be.

06:31.863 --> 06:33.797
You need to be careful.

06:33.799 --> 06:35.965
Informants are everywhere.

06:38.804 --> 06:41.376
Sorry.

06:41.379 --> 06:43.118
What are you doing here?

06:43.121 --> 06:47.077
I thought there were no
Americans left in the North.

06:47.079 --> 06:49.719
We're-we're war correspondents.

06:49.722 --> 06:51.581
We got separated from our unit.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.680
I'm Rachel Maddow and this...

06:55.994 --> 06:57.844
Just... I'm Lucy, this is Jiya.

07:11.636 --> 07:13.136
I am Young-Hee.

07:13.138 --> 07:14.637
Hi.

07:14.639 --> 07:16.087
Your English is very good.

07:16.090 --> 07:17.507
I went to a missionary school.

07:17.509 --> 07:20.009
- Oh.
- Are you evacuating?

07:20.011 --> 07:22.512
No. I came here to pray.

07:26.618 --> 07:28.985
My husband, uh, he's a journalist, too.

07:28.987 --> 07:30.320
But he asked too many questions.

07:30.322 --> 07:31.974
They ordered him to print lies.

07:31.977 --> 07:33.990
We heard they were coming for him.

07:33.992 --> 07:35.391
Did he go to Hungnam?

07:36.452 --> 07:38.953
Yeah. With my son, Tae Woo.

07:38.964 --> 07:41.865
I pray they are safe on the boat.

07:41.867 --> 07:44.134
And what about you? What...

07:44.136 --> 07:45.668
what are you going to do?

07:45.670 --> 07:48.671
Wait until our army
pushes the Chinese back.

07:48.673 --> 07:51.274
In a few days, maybe
this will all be over.

07:51.276 --> 07:53.743
Then my husband and son will come home.

08:03.355 --> 08:05.522
I still can't believe Jessica was alive.

08:05.524 --> 08:06.844
Or that I was dead.

08:06.847 --> 08:08.291
My memories are completely different

08:08.293 --> 08:09.498
from yours after Hollywood.

08:09.501 --> 08:11.337
You know what's crazy?

08:11.340 --> 08:13.532
Yesterday, Jiya was a
year younger than me.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.166
Now she's two years older.

08:15.169 --> 08:16.641
She looks pretty good for her age.

08:16.644 --> 08:18.365
Plus, I always had a
thing for older women.

08:18.368 --> 08:19.530
Started in middle school, actually...

08:19.532 --> 08:21.538
Rufus, I got to tell you something.

08:21.540 --> 08:25.149
Jiya being stuck in
Chinatown for three years...

08:26.211 --> 08:27.735
...that was all my fault.

08:27.738 --> 08:29.538
Jiya said it was Jessica's fault. She...

08:29.541 --> 08:32.775
Yeah, but it was my fault
for trusting Jessica.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.717
Even when I-I knew
things didn't add up...

08:34.719 --> 08:36.152
You even said so yourself.

08:37.321 --> 08:39.198
And you told me that

08:39.201 --> 08:41.802
you would never forgive me
for what happened to her.

08:44.529 --> 08:46.596
Why are you telling me this?

08:48.567 --> 08:50.967
'Cause I'd be lying to you if I didn't.

09:05.417 --> 09:06.783
Hey, Wyatt.

09:07.752 --> 09:09.152
I forgive you.

09:16.727 --> 09:18.527
That's not good.

09:18.530 --> 09:19.796
Come on.

09:21.373 --> 09:22.606
Guys, we...

09:23.343 --> 09:24.843
We gotta go.

09:24.846 --> 09:26.679
Couple North Korean
soldiers heading our way.

09:26.682 --> 09:28.704
Pretty sure they're not
here for Midnight Mass.

09:28.707 --> 09:32.141
Wait, wait, wait! We
have to take her with us.

09:32.143 --> 09:33.376
Is she important to history?

09:33.378 --> 09:35.712
- Everybody's important.
- Lucy...

09:35.714 --> 09:37.947
- what do you want me to do?
- We have to take her to Hungnam.

09:37.949 --> 09:40.527
She is super pregnant and she
put her life on the line for us,

09:40.530 --> 09:41.651
no questions asked.

09:41.653 --> 09:43.569
The Lifeboat is ten miles north,

09:43.572 --> 09:44.838
the port is eight miles south.

09:44.841 --> 09:46.441
We can't lose that much time.

09:46.444 --> 09:48.308
She thinks that her husband and son

09:48.311 --> 09:50.786
are coming home... quick history
cliffsnotes: nobody comes home.

09:50.788 --> 09:52.595
Even if they survive, she'll
be separated from her family

09:52.597 --> 09:54.564
- forever.
- I'm telling you we're not gonna

09:54.566 --> 09:56.232
make it to the Lifeboat
if we go to Hungnam.

09:56.234 --> 09:58.218
I wouldn't be here if my parents
didn't get out of Lebanon.

09:58.220 --> 10:00.506
I got a second chance.
Why shouldn't they?

10:01.397 --> 10:02.904
What's the point of saving history

10:02.907 --> 10:04.347
if we don't save the people in it?

10:34.644 --> 10:36.678
I think we lost them.
Is everybody all right?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.378
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:38.381 --> 10:39.848
We'll be lucky if we make it

10:39.850 --> 10:41.290
through town, much less to the port.

10:42.453 --> 10:43.952
I-I can't go to the port.

10:43.954 --> 10:46.988
I need to stay and wait for my
husband and son to come home.

10:46.990 --> 10:49.234
Young-hee, those men
will find you, okay,

10:49.237 --> 10:50.454
it's not safe for you
to stay here anymore.

10:50.456 --> 10:51.366
If you get on a boat,

10:51.369 --> 10:52.602
then you can catch up with your family.

10:52.604 --> 10:53.762
You'll be together.

10:53.764 --> 10:55.464
It's only a few days.

10:55.466 --> 10:56.998
What if it's not?

11:01.972 --> 11:04.005
- What's that?
- Huh?

11:04.007 --> 11:06.141
Oh, St. Christopher.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.609
Patron saint of travelers.

11:08.523 --> 11:09.756
Found it at the church.

11:09.759 --> 11:11.892
Thought we could use
a little extra luck.

11:11.895 --> 11:13.648
After everything you've been through,

11:13.650 --> 11:14.972
you still kept your faith.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.684
Rufus, you came back to me.

11:16.687 --> 11:18.019
How could I not?

11:19.456 --> 11:21.656
Merry Christmas to me.

11:28.966 --> 11:31.299
Michael.

11:31.301 --> 11:34.136
There you are.

11:34.138 --> 11:36.371
I was wondering...

11:40.677 --> 11:42.477
Mr. Cahill...

11:43.324 --> 11:45.846
I-I didn't know you'd
been released from prison.

11:45.849 --> 11:48.641
Rittenhouse always finds a way, Emma.

11:48.644 --> 11:50.652
How did you find us?

11:50.654 --> 11:54.156
I know every Rittenhouse-owned
property on the West Coast

11:54.158 --> 11:56.503
Started with the estates
and took some time

11:56.506 --> 11:58.511
to work my way down to this dump.

11:58.514 --> 12:02.167
We've had some difficult
times in your absence.

12:02.178 --> 12:05.987
The most powerful secret society

12:05.990 --> 12:09.336
the world has ever
seen, a family treasure?

12:09.339 --> 12:10.906
Reduced to this?

12:10.908 --> 12:14.576
That incredible machine
used so that you could,

12:14.578 --> 12:17.690
what... collect art?

12:17.693 --> 12:20.715
I'm... trying to replenish
Rittenhouse's assets...

12:20.717 --> 12:21.742
Save it.

12:21.745 --> 12:23.084
You're greedy...

12:23.086 --> 12:24.719
and selfish.

12:24.721 --> 12:26.688
I've been called worse.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.424
I came to say goodbye.

12:32.909 --> 12:34.796
Just give me a reason, Emma.

12:34.798 --> 12:36.901
Thank you for your help, Mr. Cahill.

12:36.904 --> 12:38.633
Couldn't have found
this place without you.

12:38.635 --> 12:39.935
You sold us out.

12:39.937 --> 12:41.102
I'm selfish, too.

12:41.104 --> 12:42.570
What did she promise you?

12:42.573 --> 12:44.852
The chance to save my daughter's life.

12:44.855 --> 12:46.922
Lucy still means something to me.

12:46.925 --> 12:49.377
Plus protection and
immunity for my teenage son.

12:49.379 --> 12:53.292
It's a family thing, Emma.

12:53.295 --> 12:56.830
Something you'll never
have or understand.

13:01.158 --> 13:02.958
How old's your son?

13:02.960 --> 13:04.626
He's eight.

13:04.628 --> 13:05.827
Does he like school?

13:05.829 --> 13:08.964
Not as much as I do. I'm a teacher.

13:08.966 --> 13:10.232
What do you teach?

13:10.234 --> 13:12.133
History.

13:12.135 --> 13:13.839
It's hard now.

13:13.842 --> 13:16.171
The Party wants us to
only teach propaganda.

13:16.173 --> 13:19.047
And a people without knowledge
of their past history,

13:19.050 --> 13:21.943
- origin, and culture is like...
- Like a tree without roots.

13:21.945 --> 13:23.411
Marcus Garvey.

13:23.413 --> 13:26.481
I used to be a history teacher, too.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.440
You all right?

13:31.443 --> 13:32.875
It happened earlier.

13:32.878 --> 13:34.166
- Yeah?
- I'm fine.

13:34.168 --> 13:35.234
Okay.

13:39.029 --> 13:40.800
Come on.

13:40.803 --> 13:42.164
Want to pop the hood again?

13:42.167 --> 13:43.633
We're only about a mile from port.

13:43.636 --> 13:45.651
Think we just need to walk
it the rest of the way.

13:45.654 --> 13:47.601
Walk? In her condition?

13:47.604 --> 13:49.371
Okay, okay.

13:52.442 --> 13:54.476
Here.

13:54.478 --> 13:57.412
It's not too much farther.

13:58.382 --> 13:59.614
Okay.

14:00.617 --> 14:02.284
Whoa.

14:02.286 --> 14:03.698
Oh, God. Wait.

14:03.701 --> 14:05.534
You're not okay,
Young-hee, you're in labor.

14:05.537 --> 14:06.969
Should we get her to the ambulance?

14:06.972 --> 14:08.723
No, it's too late. Over here, come on.

14:08.725 --> 14:11.222
Okay, oh, my God.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.560
- Set her right here.
- Go.

14:12.563 --> 14:13.962
- Right here.
- Oh, God.

14:13.964 --> 14:16.511
- I got you, we got you.
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, oh, God.

14:16.514 --> 14:17.659
All right, just breathe.

14:19.202 --> 14:20.948
- You've done this before?
- Good job.

14:20.951 --> 14:23.203
Remote village in Afghanistan.

14:23.206 --> 14:25.173
A woman was in labor for over 22 hours.

14:25.175 --> 14:26.841
Tried to get her to a
hospital, but it was too late.

14:26.843 --> 14:28.243
Healthy baby girl.

14:28.245 --> 14:29.644
So you know what you're doing?

14:29.646 --> 14:31.212
Well, nothing went wrong that time.

14:31.214 --> 14:32.487
Okay.

14:32.490 --> 14:34.748
Well, there's a... there's
a MASH facility at the port.

14:34.751 --> 14:36.384
I can, I can go find a doctor.

14:37.354 --> 14:38.750
Fine, but take Rufus with you.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.021
- Okay.
- Be careful, all right?

14:40.023 --> 14:41.890
They're shelling the perimeter
to keep the Chinese out.

14:41.892 --> 14:44.025
- Come on, let's go.
- You got this, Young-hee.

14:49.032 --> 14:51.566
My God, it's cold.

14:57.441 --> 14:59.941
In just a few hours, they
bomb this whole place?

14:59.943 --> 15:01.878
Can't leave any supplies
behind for the enemy.

15:01.881 --> 15:03.612
Everyone makes it out alive, right?

15:03.614 --> 15:05.714
Thanks to those two.

15:05.716 --> 15:07.823
That's Colonel Forney
and Dr. Hyun Bong-hak.

15:07.826 --> 15:09.794
They're the real heroes
behind this entire operation.

15:09.796 --> 15:11.720
Convinced General Almond not
to leave any refugees behind.

15:11.722 --> 15:13.455
- Colonel Forney, sir.
- Ma'am.

15:13.457 --> 15:15.590
- Why haven't you evacuated?
- I'm a war correspondent.

15:15.592 --> 15:17.392
Lucy Preston. I work
with Maggie Higgins.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.425
We put Maggie on a plane days ago.

15:19.428 --> 15:20.794
I know; we got separated.

15:20.797 --> 15:21.963
We need to get you on a boat.

15:21.966 --> 15:22.974
Of course, of course, but, uh...

15:22.976 --> 15:24.339
Private Carlin here, he...

15:24.342 --> 15:26.101
came across a refugee
who's gone into labor.

15:26.103 --> 15:27.869
We need a-a nurse or a-a doctor.

15:27.871 --> 15:29.831
- Soon as possible.
- Uh, MASH unit's jammed up

15:29.834 --> 15:31.539
with injured patients;
we need everyone we got.

15:31.541 --> 15:33.208
- Sir, please.
- Ma'am. I got to make sure

15:33.210 --> 15:35.808
everyone in this port
gets out safely, okay?

15:35.811 --> 15:38.112
Uh, maybe you can find a midwife.

15:38.115 --> 15:40.148
I-I'll take care of this, Colonel.

15:40.150 --> 15:41.417
Really?

15:41.420 --> 15:43.375
Last boat departs at 1400 hours.

15:43.378 --> 15:45.320
Okay, let's go.

15:45.322 --> 15:46.815
Come on, come on!

15:48.291 --> 15:50.559
Jiya, run back to the ambulance,
see if you can find supplies.

15:50.561 --> 15:52.270
Emergency blankets, towels,
first aid kit, anything.

15:52.272 --> 15:54.462
- Okay, but the doctor is...
- No time to wait for a doctor.

15:54.464 --> 15:56.431
This baby's coming now. Go.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.104
Around that corner.

16:03.106 --> 16:04.792
Up that hill, about a mile away.

16:07.644 --> 16:09.377
Oh! Oh, my God!

16:12.582 --> 16:14.149
- Wyatt!
- Jiya!

16:16.678 --> 16:19.564
Wyatt! Wyatt!

16:19.566 --> 16:21.607
- Oh, my God.
- Artillery fire.

16:21.610 --> 16:24.603
No. Oh, my God.

16:24.605 --> 16:25.871
Wyatt!

16:25.873 --> 16:27.906
Oh, my God.

16:27.916 --> 16:30.149
That was close, huh?

16:36.583 --> 16:37.916
It's a girl.

16:46.889 --> 16:49.261
Jiya, Jiya.

16:52.032 --> 16:54.799
Oh, my God... oh.

16:56.259 --> 16:57.576
Wyatt delivered a baby.

16:57.579 --> 16:59.421
In the middle of a war
zone. Who does that?

16:59.424 --> 17:00.655
All right, wasn't a big deal.

17:00.658 --> 17:02.191
What else don't I know about you?

17:03.577 --> 17:05.310
Guys, we need to get to the Lifeboat.

17:05.311 --> 17:06.744
I'll try and find us a truck.

17:06.747 --> 17:09.131
We will make you as
comfortable as possible.

17:09.134 --> 17:10.814
But we have to get you on a boat soon.

17:10.817 --> 17:13.117
But how will I find
my husband and my son?

17:13.119 --> 17:15.153
There was no time for record keeping.

17:15.155 --> 17:16.755
You will see him in Pusan, I think.

17:16.757 --> 17:17.955
- No...
- No, no, no, Young-hee.

17:17.958 --> 17:19.124
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Young-hee.

17:19.126 --> 17:21.259
- Listen to me.
- Oma.

17:22.996 --> 17:24.763
Oh... Okay, okay.

17:36.814 --> 17:38.944
I think this little
treasure belongs to you.

17:42.938 --> 17:44.604
The boats are leaving soon.

17:44.607 --> 17:45.750
Thank you.

17:45.752 --> 17:47.285
- Oh.
- For everything.

17:47.287 --> 17:48.453
Of course, of course.

17:48.455 --> 17:50.488
Good luck. Good luck!

17:50.490 --> 17:52.691
Okay.

17:57.998 --> 18:00.237
Guys? Problem. We can't get a truck.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.663
Rufus, there's like
a million of 'em here.

18:01.665 --> 18:02.827
They're all rigged with explosives.

18:02.829 --> 18:05.193
They're gonna blow up the
minute the last boat leaves port.

18:05.196 --> 18:07.372
Anything with four wheels is a bomb.

18:11.878 --> 18:13.545
You okay?

18:13.547 --> 18:15.547
I'm trying to have a
vision of a hot shower.

18:15.549 --> 18:17.639
- Leave me alone.
- Cool, cool, cool.

18:17.642 --> 18:19.806
What are the signs of frostbite again?

18:28.693 --> 18:29.894
Who kills a nun?

18:32.873 --> 18:34.539
Communists.

18:35.545 --> 18:38.069
We're surrounded.

18:38.071 --> 18:40.171
Can't outrun 'em, we can't fight 'em.

18:40.173 --> 18:42.807
We need to hide. Come on.

18:52.052 --> 18:53.865
Stop. They'll see us.

18:53.868 --> 18:56.170
- What if they find us anyway?
- Well...

18:56.173 --> 18:58.155
I fire as many rounds as I have left.

18:58.158 --> 19:00.725
And then? Good talk.

19:00.727 --> 19:03.725
I just really don't
want to die... again.

19:03.728 --> 19:05.897
Would you stop it? We're
not gonna die, okay?

19:05.900 --> 19:07.589
Not after everything we've been through.

19:07.592 --> 19:10.101
Honestly, I hope you're right.

19:10.103 --> 19:14.606
I hope there is a god and
that he or she saves us.

19:14.608 --> 19:18.243
You'd think he/she would
save the nun, though, right?

19:20.047 --> 19:21.680
Just saying.

19:24.685 --> 19:27.652
See? You still laugh at my jokes.

19:32.059 --> 19:34.178
I'm glad we're...

19:34.181 --> 19:35.480
together.

19:40.451 --> 19:42.634
Look, Jiya, I know things
are different for you.

19:42.636 --> 19:44.602
But...

19:45.572 --> 19:48.473
...we're still us.

19:48.475 --> 19:50.170
And for me...

19:50.173 --> 19:51.779
there's no one else I'd rather face

19:51.782 --> 19:54.849
a bloodthirsty army of Communists with.

19:56.515 --> 19:57.814
Me, too.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.667
What are you thinking about?

20:21.608 --> 20:22.907
Flynn.

20:24.669 --> 20:26.936
The last thing that he
said to us before he left

20:26.939 --> 20:29.573
to get in the Lifeboat was...

20:29.576 --> 20:33.852
"If we all run off to save
Rufus, who will save the world?"

20:33.854 --> 20:35.086
If we die tonight...

20:35.088 --> 20:37.422
I'm not giving up yet.

20:41.261 --> 20:43.328
Guess it's all up to fate.

20:46.155 --> 20:47.488
What?

20:49.265 --> 20:50.565
Just you...

20:52.779 --> 20:54.372
...talking about fate.

20:58.111 --> 20:59.944
So you were right.

20:59.946 --> 21:03.281
And here you had me convinced
that there was no such thing.

21:04.551 --> 21:06.117
Timing is everything, huh?

21:17.697 --> 21:20.115
After that explosion,
I thought you were dead.

21:21.274 --> 21:24.168
And for a moment, I saw my...

21:24.171 --> 21:27.005
whole life without you...

21:27.007 --> 21:29.707
and my world ended, Wyatt.

21:29.709 --> 21:32.475
I just kept thinking about...

21:32.478 --> 21:35.145
all this time that we had wasted.

21:35.148 --> 21:37.315
Just wasting so much time and...

21:37.317 --> 21:39.250
and then all of a
sudden, there you were.

21:40.237 --> 21:42.971
Holding a stranger's baby
that you had delivered.

21:44.191 --> 21:45.757
And I knew.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.092
You knew what?

21:48.205 --> 21:49.993
I'd fallen in love with you.

21:49.996 --> 21:52.397
And nothing that
happened or didn't happen

21:52.400 --> 21:55.193
or might happen was
ever gonna change it.

22:06.446 --> 22:08.179
I love you, Wyatt Logan.

22:08.181 --> 22:10.515
I've loved you since the Alamo.

22:10.517 --> 22:13.418
Since you kissed me
with Bonnie and Clyde.

22:13.420 --> 22:16.354
Since that night in Hollywood.

22:16.356 --> 22:18.356
What happened after...

22:20.026 --> 22:22.193
I wanted to choose you.

22:22.196 --> 22:24.195
I just felt like I owed her something.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.599
I wish I could take it all back.

22:29.272 --> 22:31.870
And the crazy part
is, Flynn already did.

22:31.872 --> 22:34.943
And now... all that we have between us

22:34.946 --> 22:36.875
is a past that only we remember.

22:42.672 --> 22:44.004
So...

22:45.943 --> 22:47.785
I don't care about the past anymore.

22:47.787 --> 22:50.355
And we might not have a future.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.336
Maybe all that matters is right now.

23:34.123 --> 23:37.101
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

23:37.103 --> 23:39.137
I can't believe you're here.

23:39.139 --> 23:40.939
Oh...

23:40.941 --> 23:43.341
Oh.

23:43.343 --> 23:45.834
I didn't want to have to leave
you here to die on Christmas.

23:45.837 --> 23:48.246
Plus, I wanted to
time-travel at least once.

23:49.616 --> 23:51.201
What? No hug?

23:51.204 --> 23:52.725
What would Jesus do?

23:52.728 --> 23:54.139
And you brought Scrooge.

23:54.142 --> 23:55.820
Was it the Ghost of
Christmas Past or Future

23:55.822 --> 23:57.221
- that got her here?
- I think I liked it

23:57.223 --> 23:58.323
better when you were dead.

23:58.326 --> 23:59.417
Sorry it didn't take.

23:59.420 --> 24:00.834
How'd you like time-traveling?

24:00.837 --> 24:02.304
Not my choice of destinations,

24:02.306 --> 24:04.873
but still quite the miracle.

24:04.876 --> 24:07.565
Guys, it's just...

24:08.535 --> 24:10.101
St. Christopher.

24:12.238 --> 24:14.015
Agent Christopher.

24:14.018 --> 24:15.851
Oh, come on.

24:17.811 --> 24:18.977
Hey.

24:18.979 --> 24:20.712
Okay, wait, wait.

24:21.881 --> 24:23.772
I can bring Amy back.

24:25.552 --> 24:27.185
She's lying.

24:27.187 --> 24:29.754
Try me.

24:38.264 --> 24:41.034
I only did it 'cause
your mother ordered me to.

24:41.037 --> 24:42.866
But I can undo it.

24:42.869 --> 24:45.103
Means nothing to me
and everything to you.

24:47.116 --> 24:48.449
The truth is...

24:49.843 --> 24:52.043
I admire you, Lucy.

24:52.045 --> 24:55.092
We would make one hell of a team.

24:55.095 --> 24:56.722
Screw the Rittenhouse agenda;

24:56.725 --> 24:59.092
we could make history whatever we want.

25:04.257 --> 25:06.224
I want all of this to be over.

25:06.226 --> 25:09.293
And you want your sister back.

25:11.528 --> 25:13.361
I can make that happen.

25:13.364 --> 25:15.881
You just have to trust me.

25:25.343 --> 25:27.410
I don't.

25:29.115 --> 25:31.149
She gets any closer to
that ship, shoot her.

25:32.619 --> 25:34.652
Oh, oh.

25:35.422 --> 25:37.355
Everybody get to the Mothership!

25:41.561 --> 25:42.727
Come on!

25:53.588 --> 25:55.920
Rufus is gonna get the
Mothership home, right?

25:55.923 --> 25:58.490
Well, Rufus got us to
the Lifeboat, didn't he?

26:00.891 --> 26:02.958
Maybe our future selves
came back to save Rufus

26:02.960 --> 26:04.426
so that he could save us all.

26:04.428 --> 26:05.927
Yeah, or maybe...

26:05.929 --> 26:07.629
Maybe what?

26:09.600 --> 26:11.099
Maybe they wanted things to turn out

26:11.101 --> 26:12.667
differently for us than it did them.

26:18.074 --> 26:21.308
You know, I think I
can handle this by now.

26:21.311 --> 26:24.446
Oh, it's no problem at all... ma'am.

26:24.448 --> 26:26.948
Don't you call me "ma'am."

26:28.819 --> 26:30.185
What?

26:32.467 --> 26:34.423
We can try to get Amy back now.

26:34.425 --> 26:36.291
We have both time machines.

26:36.293 --> 26:37.732
No.

26:37.735 --> 26:39.894
- Yeah, but the stuff in the journal...
- No, Wyatt.

26:39.897 --> 26:41.196
I've thought a lot about this.

26:43.734 --> 26:45.522
Look at all the awful things

26:45.525 --> 26:47.936
that Flynn did in the
name of saving his family.

26:47.938 --> 26:50.272
Look what happened when
you got Jessica back.

26:50.274 --> 26:51.412
I mean, I am...

26:51.415 --> 26:53.818
so thankful that we saved Rufus,

26:53.821 --> 26:55.709
but it cost us Flynn.

26:57.114 --> 26:59.815
And if we're willing to use this machine

26:59.817 --> 27:01.479
to get back the things that we've lost,

27:01.482 --> 27:03.318
no matter the price, I mean,

27:03.320 --> 27:05.020
when will it end?

27:05.022 --> 27:08.023
We'd be no better
than my mother or Emma.

27:18.135 --> 27:19.948
You're sure you're okay with that?

27:19.951 --> 27:21.670
Of course not.

27:23.206 --> 27:26.467
But everybody loses
someone that they love...

27:26.470 --> 27:28.236
and no matter how badly they want to,

27:28.239 --> 27:30.106
they can't get them back.

27:34.384 --> 27:37.519
And in spite of that,
they find a way to go on.

27:40.557 --> 27:42.424
That's everyone's history.

27:50.868 --> 27:53.401
All right. Well...

27:53.403 --> 27:56.131
Jiya said autopilot, right?

27:56.134 --> 27:58.101
You sure you know what you're doing?

28:06.183 --> 28:07.749
All right.

28:07.751 --> 28:11.086
Looks like we'll be home
for Christmas after all.

28:30.741 --> 28:32.707
- We did it.
- You did it.

28:32.709 --> 28:34.075
I knew I could do it.

28:34.077 --> 28:36.104
Um, you were scared out of your mind.

28:36.107 --> 28:37.779
I was mildly anxious.

28:37.781 --> 28:38.857
You did it anyway.

28:38.860 --> 28:39.881
So much fun!

28:39.884 --> 28:41.909
- You flew the Mothership!
- Too bad it's being

28:41.912 --> 28:43.685
destroyed as we speak.

28:43.687 --> 28:46.187
Maybe we haven't changed
so much after all.

28:46.189 --> 28:49.524
I am so glad to hear you say that.

28:51.516 --> 28:53.961
So... what now?

28:53.964 --> 28:55.664
What now what?

28:57.900 --> 28:59.934
Well, we're gonna have to get new jobs.

28:59.937 --> 29:01.318
I guess so.

29:01.321 --> 29:03.421
Can't exactly put "time
traveler" on my résumé.

29:03.424 --> 29:05.758
Hmm.

29:05.761 --> 29:08.076
You get to see your family again.

29:08.078 --> 29:10.936
They think I died in an
explosion at Mason Industries.

29:10.939 --> 29:12.914
I'm making more comebacks than Elvis.

29:12.916 --> 29:14.482
You have practice.

29:14.484 --> 29:16.409
I guess I'll finally
have to get my own place.

29:16.412 --> 29:18.887
- Guess so.
- Still, it was a lot of fun...

29:18.889 --> 29:19.951
living together, right?

29:19.954 --> 29:21.488
Yeah, it had its moments.

29:21.491 --> 29:25.060
Gonna miss it... sort of, yeah.

29:27.464 --> 29:30.498
Is this your awkward way of
asking to move in with me?

29:30.501 --> 29:32.232
Way to take a hint, lady.

29:34.338 --> 29:36.638
So, is that a yes?

29:38.976 --> 29:40.542
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:40.545 --> 29:42.779
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's a yes, that's a yes.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.579
It's a yes. Go for it.

29:46.183 --> 29:48.283
- Hey, listen to this.
- Yep.

29:48.285 --> 29:53.288
Young-hee died in 2007;
she lived well into her 80s.

29:53.290 --> 29:56.157
Tae Woo's a retired
investment banker in Seoul.

29:56.159 --> 29:59.461
Their daughter is a teacher
just like their mother.

29:59.463 --> 30:01.930
- Two kids.
- Wow.

30:02.933 --> 30:05.133
Sounds like a crazy, ordinary...

30:05.135 --> 30:06.468
wonderful life.

30:06.470 --> 30:08.003
Thanks to you.

30:08.972 --> 30:10.205
No.

30:10.207 --> 30:12.217
That was your call.

30:12.220 --> 30:14.376
You're the one that said
everyone's important.

30:14.378 --> 30:15.717
Maybe not to history,

30:15.720 --> 30:18.647
but everybody's important
to someone, I think.

30:20.484 --> 30:21.750
Careful.

30:24.454 --> 30:25.881
How'd that get there?

30:25.884 --> 30:28.956
Apparently Agent Christopher has
a dirtier mind than we thought.

30:28.959 --> 30:31.201
Well...

30:31.204 --> 30:33.227
- I mean, it is a custom.
- Hmm.

30:33.230 --> 30:34.729
- All right?
- Hmm, hmm.

30:44.100 --> 30:46.474
That's the first time we've
done that in the present.

30:46.476 --> 30:49.544
I mean, our present. I mean... 2018.

30:49.546 --> 30:50.879
Hmm.

30:50.881 --> 30:53.148
Well, it's gonna be 2019 soon.

30:53.150 --> 30:54.349
True.

30:54.351 --> 30:56.519
So, maybe we should...

30:56.522 --> 30:58.586
Make up for lost time?

31:17.928 --> 31:20.655
- This one is for you.
- Uh, okay.

31:20.658 --> 31:22.530
This one for you.

31:22.533 --> 31:24.433
- This one is for you.
- Mmm.

31:24.436 --> 31:25.709
- Oh.
- And there you go.

31:25.712 --> 31:28.881
Wow, you shouldn't
have. You-you really...

31:28.884 --> 31:31.816
- really shouldn't have.
- It's the thought that counts.

31:31.819 --> 31:34.366
- And the thought was what, exactly?
- Hey.

31:34.368 --> 31:36.802
Uh, it's lovely.

31:38.639 --> 31:40.705
Guys...

31:41.875 --> 31:43.041
...we did it.

31:43.043 --> 31:46.912
We stopped Rittenhouse.

31:46.914 --> 31:48.980
We won.

31:49.944 --> 31:51.090
Cheers.

31:51.100 --> 31:52.483
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:52.486 --> 31:54.085
Flynn would be proud.

31:54.087 --> 31:56.555
Yes, he would have.

31:57.772 --> 31:59.691
So, is this our last morning together?

31:59.693 --> 32:02.160
- You know, as a family.
- Yep.

32:02.162 --> 32:05.597
As of 0900 hours, you
are all free to go.

32:05.599 --> 32:07.833
Except for you. The
paperwork came through.

32:07.835 --> 32:10.869
You're officially assigned
to special projects with me.

32:10.871 --> 32:12.437
No one I'd rather report to.

32:17.880 --> 32:20.047
You look bloody ridiculous.

32:20.050 --> 32:22.941
My children compete to find me
the ugliest Christmas sweater.

32:22.944 --> 32:24.049
And Mark won.

32:24.051 --> 32:25.373
I wear it with pride.

32:25.376 --> 32:26.825
Will you take that bloody
thing off your head?

32:26.827 --> 32:28.878
You look like some sort of drunk elf.

32:28.881 --> 32:31.338
You get a lump of coal
in your stocking or what?

32:31.341 --> 32:32.316
No.

32:32.319 --> 32:35.193
- Just this.
- What's that?

32:35.195 --> 32:37.062
All that's left of the Mothership.

32:37.064 --> 32:38.129
I'm sorry, Connor.

32:38.131 --> 32:39.567
No, don't be.

32:39.570 --> 32:41.269
If there's one thing I've learned,

32:41.272 --> 32:44.137
a machine that powerful is too
dangerous in anyone's hands.

32:44.140 --> 32:46.941
Now, I suppose, we need to
disassemble the Lifeboat.

32:46.944 --> 32:48.974
We're keeping the Lifeboat.

32:51.111 --> 32:53.078
A wise man once told me

32:53.080 --> 32:55.046
that if it's possible
to build a time machine,

32:55.048 --> 32:56.366
someone will build it,

32:56.369 --> 32:57.827
and we'll need a way to stop them.

32:57.830 --> 33:01.319
So the Lifeboat stays
here, under armed guard.

33:19.273 --> 33:21.678
- Uh, Professor Preston.
- Yeah?

33:21.681 --> 33:24.008
So, you were saying
that, without Alice Paul,

33:24.011 --> 33:26.378
Grace Humiston is just
a detective in New York?

33:26.381 --> 33:27.846
That's right.

33:27.848 --> 33:30.256
- How do you know...?
- Trust me. I know.

33:30.259 --> 33:32.182
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

33:32.185 --> 33:34.019
Hey, have a happy holiday,
and don't forget to review

33:34.021 --> 33:35.320
- the Harriet Tubman material, all right?
- Yes, okay.

33:35.322 --> 33:36.354
- Okay, see you soon.
- Bye.

33:36.356 --> 33:37.878
- Bye, Tegan.
- Hey.

33:37.881 --> 33:39.280
- Yeah?
- This was supposed to be

33:39.283 --> 33:41.319
a regular American history class.

33:41.322 --> 33:42.896
How come we're only studying women?

33:42.899 --> 33:45.363
I meant to get to the men,
but we just didn't have time.

33:45.366 --> 33:49.434
Maybe in the spring,
okay? Merry Christmas. Bye.

33:49.436 --> 33:53.972
Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!

33:55.175 --> 33:57.342
Get me, get me again, get me.

33:57.344 --> 34:00.834
Ah, ah, oh, no! Oh, no! Ah!

34:00.837 --> 34:02.069
Dad.

34:02.072 --> 34:04.649
Oh, it's back to basic training for me.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.217
- Hello. Hello, hello, hello!
- Mommy!

34:06.219 --> 34:08.053
Go see Mom.

34:08.056 --> 34:10.292
What are you torturing
Daddy with this time, huh?

34:10.295 --> 34:12.023
- Boot camp.
- Boot camp?

34:12.025 --> 34:14.326
Well, I hope you didn't
go too easy on him. Mwah.

34:14.328 --> 34:16.393
Go play.

34:20.333 --> 34:21.967
- Guess what.
- What?

34:21.969 --> 34:24.202
- I got tenure.
- You...

34:30.877 --> 34:33.110
- I am so proud of you.
- Thank you.

34:36.483 --> 34:39.851
Flynn! Amy! You ready to go?

34:39.853 --> 34:41.092
Come on.

34:42.255 --> 34:44.255
Come over here. Give me your hand.

34:44.257 --> 34:47.492
All right. You ready for this?

34:47.494 --> 34:49.594
Ready as I'll ever be.

34:51.271 --> 34:53.167
We were hoping to get a better facility,

34:53.170 --> 34:56.266
but funding was even shorter than usual.

34:56.268 --> 34:58.003
We all started somewhere.

34:58.005 --> 35:00.105
When Rufus and I
started Riya Industries,

35:00.107 --> 35:01.673
I wanted to build a better future.

35:01.675 --> 35:05.677
But Rufus, all about giving
back to the community.

35:05.679 --> 35:07.679
He was just like these kids once.

35:11.269 --> 35:12.602
It's called a Leyden jar,

35:12.605 --> 35:14.518
and it was actually the first capacitor.

35:14.521 --> 35:16.421
Yeah, I've seen one of these before,

35:16.423 --> 35:20.045
- but yours is definitely better.
- Hey, guys.

35:20.048 --> 35:22.761
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yeah, sure.

35:23.964 --> 35:26.331
Thank you.

35:28.811 --> 35:30.720
How come nobody asks for my autograph?

35:30.723 --> 35:32.090
'Cause you wanted to
be the mysterious one

35:32.092 --> 35:33.471
- behind the scenes.
- Ah.

35:33.473 --> 35:34.939
You know, I think it's about time

35:34.941 --> 35:36.541
- to, uh, do the...
- Rufus Carlin,

35:36.543 --> 35:37.876
if anything happens to you...

35:37.878 --> 35:40.645
Hey, I am the guy that
came back from the dead.

35:40.647 --> 35:42.213
You're never gonna stop
saying that, are you?

35:42.215 --> 35:44.147
Yeah, no. Why would I?

35:51.124 --> 35:53.272
The twins are in their pajamas,

35:53.275 --> 35:54.442
and they are brushing their teeth.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.460
They are so excited
about their sleepover.

35:56.463 --> 35:58.963
When I told them that Mommy
and Daddy used to live here...

35:58.965 --> 36:00.273
...they didn't believe me.

36:00.275 --> 36:01.351
That's because,

36:01.353 --> 36:02.800
like most government-funded housing,

36:02.803 --> 36:04.436
it's utterly uninhabitable
and always was.

36:04.438 --> 36:06.971
Says the man under
federal contract, right?

36:06.973 --> 36:08.639
Well, it turns out

36:08.642 --> 36:11.942
I liked, uh, saving the world
more than I liked saving money.

36:11.945 --> 36:14.446
So, you ever miss saving the world?

36:14.448 --> 36:16.842
Sometimes.

36:16.845 --> 36:19.109
- And then I think about North Korea...
- French and Indian War.

36:19.111 --> 36:21.019
...the Murder Castle, Al
Capone trying to kill us.

36:21.021 --> 36:24.122
- Benedict Arnold.
- Confederate slave owners.

36:24.124 --> 36:25.803
Nazis.

36:25.806 --> 36:27.858
Ready to do it one more time?

36:27.861 --> 36:28.952
We have to,

36:28.955 --> 36:31.945
or all of this could disappear.

36:31.948 --> 36:34.563
Hey! Anybody need a pilot?

36:38.472 --> 36:39.971
Hi.

36:39.973 --> 36:42.507
You didn't tell me he was coming.

36:42.509 --> 36:44.042
Think we'd let you do it alone?

36:44.044 --> 36:45.673
Yeah, the three of us started it,

36:45.676 --> 36:47.777
so let's finish it.

36:53.019 --> 36:55.286
- Okay, but if anything goes wrong...
- It won't.

36:55.288 --> 36:57.113
We get in and we get out.

36:57.116 --> 36:59.373
We got this, Lucy.

37:09.317 --> 37:14.607
_

37:26.117 --> 37:27.716
Is this seat taken?

37:27.719 --> 37:29.753
Eu nao falo English.

37:35.228 --> 37:38.506
I know you speak English, Flynn.

37:38.509 --> 37:40.417
Don't worry, I'm a friend.

37:40.420 --> 37:42.233
I mean, I will be a friend.

37:42.235 --> 37:44.035
- What do you want?
- I don't have a lot of time.

37:44.037 --> 37:45.336
I know about Rittenhouse.

37:45.338 --> 37:46.431
I know what they did to your family...

37:46.433 --> 37:48.005
Your wife Lorena, your daughter Iris.

37:48.008 --> 37:49.120
- Who are you?
- Shh!

37:49.123 --> 37:50.542
My name is Lucy Preston.

37:50.544 --> 37:52.010
I'm from the year 2023.

37:52.012 --> 37:54.081
And I know this is going to sound crazy,

37:54.084 --> 37:56.514
but someday you and I are
going to work together.

37:56.516 --> 37:59.751
My God. The time machine.

37:59.753 --> 38:02.120
Connor Mason actually
built it. I knew it.

38:02.122 --> 38:04.339
You were right. You were
right about everything.

38:04.342 --> 38:06.858
More than you will ever know.

38:06.860 --> 38:08.927
But you...

38:13.768 --> 38:16.152
Okay, look.

38:16.155 --> 38:19.103
You are going to have to
sacrifice everything for a cause

38:19.105 --> 38:20.905
that almost no one will believe in.

38:20.907 --> 38:24.042
The world will think that
you're a terrorist and a traitor.

38:24.044 --> 38:26.744
- Even I'm going to think that at first.
- Wha... What?

38:26.746 --> 38:29.414
Wait, listen to me. But you
aren't any of those things.

38:29.416 --> 38:31.549
And you're going to think
that you lost your humanity,

38:31.551 --> 38:33.918
but you didn't, and you never will.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.121
What about my family?

38:41.561 --> 38:43.094
You won't get them back.

38:43.096 --> 38:45.196
I'm sorry.

38:47.241 --> 38:49.341
You're a hero, I promise.

38:50.678 --> 38:52.678
Maybe the greatest hero of us all.

38:55.115 --> 38:58.014
But you're going to
need my help, okay, so...

38:59.980 --> 39:01.145
Oh, God...

39:01.147 --> 39:03.648
Hey, you okay?

39:06.585 --> 39:08.702
Here, take this.

39:08.705 --> 39:10.933
You are going to save history.

41:32.966 --> 41:35.295
Paulina. Dinner.

41:35.298 --> 41:37.464
Okay.

41:41.022 --> 41:42.839
Hey. Dinner. Now.

41:42.842 --> 41:45.276
You're working too much.

41:45.278 --> 41:48.012
Okay, I'll be right there.
