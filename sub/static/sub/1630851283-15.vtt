>> "60 MINUTES" TRAVELED
TO EUROPE, TO FIND OUT HOW
EXTREME WEATHER IS AFFECTING

00:15.782 --> 00:23.123
SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS WINES
IN THE WORLD.
HOW MANY BOTTLES WERE YOU ABLE
TO PRODUCE?

00:23.189 --> 00:31.431
>> A NORMAL YEAR, I PRODUCE
AROUND 40,000, 50,000 BOTTLES.
>> THIS YEAR?
>> ZERO.

00:31.498 --> 00:39.406
>> CLIMATE CHANGE HAS AFFECTED
MANY OF FRANCE'S VINTAGES
SEVERELY.
ITS ECONOMY, TOO.

00:39.472 --> 00:47.180
BUT IN RAINY OLD ENGLAND, ACROSS
THE CHANNEL, WE FOUND A VERY
DIFFERENT STORY.
DO YOU THINK THAT WINE LOVERS

00:47.247 --> 00:52.886
AROUND THE WORLD ALREADY KNOW
THAT GREAT WINES ARE COMING OUT
OF ENGLAND?
IN OTHER WORDS--

00:52.952 --> 00:56.823
IS IT “OOH, LA LA" NO MORE?
IT'S "JOLLY GOOD"?
(<i> LAUGHTER</i> )

01:01.494 --> 01:05.832
>> IF HE'S NOT PUBLIC ENEMY
NUMBER ONE IN CHINA, HE'S UP
THERE.
TONIGHT, WE'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO

01:05.899 --> 01:14.841
BADIUCAO.
PART GUERILLA ACTIVIST, PART
POLITICAL CARTOONIST, HE LIVES
IN EXILE, TRAVELING THE WORLD

01:14.908 --> 01:23.116
USING PAINT AND WIT-- ONLINE AND
ON WALLS-- TO DRAW TRUTH TO
POWER, INFURIATING THE C.C.P.--
THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY.

01:23.183 --> 01:30.890
>> I AM AN INDIVIDUAL.
I'M NOT CONTROLLED BY ANY
AUTHORITY, CERTAINLY NOT C.C.P.
THAT SCARES THEM.

01:30.957 --> 01:35.862
BECAUSE ALL THEY WANT IS
TOTAL CONTROL.
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> I'M LESLEY STAHL.

01:35.929 --> 01:40.467
>> I'M BILL WHITAKER.
>> I'M ANDERSON COOPER.
>> I'M SHARYN ALFONSI.
>> I'M JON WERTHEIM.

01:40.533 --> 01:51.811
>> I'M SCOTT PELLEY.
THOSE STORIES AND MORE, TONIGHT,
ON "60 MINUTES."
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:53.513 --> 01:59.018
>> Stahl: WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF
GLOBAL WARMING?
GLACIERS ARE MELTING AT AN
INCREASINGLY RAPID PACE.

01:59.085 --> 02:05.358
PERSISTENT DROUGHTS ARE
SPREADING.
WELL, WE HAVE ANOTHER TO
TELL YOU ABOUT--

02:05.425 --> 02:10.797
WINE.
AS IN, WHAT YOU PROBABLY CRACKED
OPEN FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER.
FARMERS WHO GROW THE GRAPES

02:10.864 --> 02:18.538
HAVE SEEN THE EFFECTS OF
CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE SOIL,
IN THE ROOTS OF THE VINES, AND
THE YIELDS OF THEIR CROPS.

02:18.605 --> 02:28.915
FRANCE, A MAJOR CENTER OF
WINEMAKING FOR CENTURIES, IS
EXPERIENCING INCREASINGLY HIGHER
TEMPERATURES AND EXTREME WEATHER

02:28.982 --> 02:34.120
CONDITIONS THAT HAVE DAMAGED
VINTAGES AND LIVELIHOODS.
THIS YEAR WAS PARTICULARLY
DRAMATIC.

02:34.187 --> 02:44.964
FRANCE RECORDED ITS SMALLEST
HARVEST SINCE 1957, AND STANDS
TO LOSE MORE THAN $2 BILLION IN
SALES, A HUGE BLOW TO THE

02:45.031 --> 02:53.506
COUNTRY'S SECOND-LARGEST EXPORT
INDUSTRY.
AND IT'S HITTING NEARLY ALL THE
WINE-GROWING REGIONS, WHERE THEY

02:53.573 --> 03:04.884
MAKE DRY WHITES, FRUITY REDS,
AND FIZZY CHAMPAGNE.
ALL BUBBLIES ARE CALLED
SPARKLING WINE, BUT CHAMPAGNE IS

03:04.951 --> 03:10.456
MADE HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE--
IN THESE VINEYARDS AND VILLAGES
OF CHAMPAGNE, LOCATED IN
NORTHEASTERN FRANCE.

03:10.523 --> 03:18.665
THERE'S A MYSTIQUE TO CHAMPAGNE,
AN AURA OF ROMANCE.
COCO CHANEL ONCE SAID, “I ONLY
DRINK CHAMPAGNE ON TWO

03:18.731 --> 03:28.775
OCCASIONS-- WHEN I'M IN LOVE,
AND WHEN I'M NOT."
THEY'VE BEEN PRODUCING THIS“
WINE OF KINGS” HERE FOR

03:28.841 --> 03:34.981
CENTURIES.
SO, HOW LONG HAS THIS WINEMAKING
BUSINESS AND THE VINEYARDS BEEN
IN YOUR FAMILY?

03:35.048 --> 03:40.920
>> Christine Sevillano: FROM
1700.
>> Stahl: 1700.
>> Sevillano: YES.

03:40.987 --> 03:47.594
>> Stahl: CHRISTINE SEVILLANO
TOOK OVER THE FAMILY BUSINESS
AND ITS 20 ACRES OF VINES
14 YEARS AGO.

03:47.660 --> 03:53.533
SHE'S THE TENTH GENERATION.
>> Sevillano: THIS IS THE CELLAR
OF MY GRANDFATHER.
>> Stahl: OH.

03:53.600 --> 04:02.041
AFTER SURVIVING THE FRENCH
REVOLUTION AND TWO WORLD WARS,
HER FAMILY'S HOUSE OF PIOT-
SEVILLANO FACED ITS WORST YEAR

04:02.108 --> 04:06.913
EVER IN 2021.
>> Sevillano: WE LOST 90% OF OUR
HARVEST.
>> Stahl: 90%?

04:06.980 --> 04:18.224
>> Sevillano: YES.
>> Stahl: HOW MANY BOTTLES WERE
YOU ABLE TO PRODUCE THIS YEAR,
AS OPPOSED TO A NORMAL YEAR?

04:18.291 --> 04:22.095
>> Sevillano: A NORMAL YEAR,
I PRODUCE AROUND 40,000, 50,000
BOTTLES.
>> Stahl: AND THIS YEAR?

04:22.161 --> 04:30.169
>> Sevillano: ZERO.
IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN THE
HISTORY OF MY WINERY THAT WE
WILL NOT MAKE CHAMPAGNE.

04:30.236 --> 04:37.977
>> Stahl: NOT A SINGLE BOTTLE
FROM THIS WINERY?
>> Sevillano: YES, YES.
>> Stahl: HIGHER TEMPERATURES

04:38.044 --> 04:45.284
AND EXTREME WEATHER EPISODES
DEVASTATED NOT ONLY HER HARVEST,
BUT MUCH OF CHAMPAGNE'S.
>> Sevillano: IT RAINED IN

04:45.351 --> 04:52.091
TWO OR THREE DAYS THAT IT
RAINED NORMALLY IN ONE MONTH.
EVEN MY FATHER TOLD ME THAT
IN HIS CAREER HE HAS NEVER SEEN

04:52.158 --> 04:58.031
THAT.
>> Stahl: ALMOST FLOOD-LIKE?
>> Sevillano: YES.
>> Stahl: THE WORST OF IT, SHE

04:58.097 --> 05:05.238
SAYS, CAME IN JUNE AND JULY,
WHEN THE HEAT AND THE RAINS
RESULTED IN A MORE CRIPPLING
OUTBREAK THAN USUAL OF FUNGUSES,

05:05.304 --> 05:15.181
LIKE MILDEW CONTAMINATION.
>> Sevillano: IN FACT, WHEN THE
GRAPES ARE CONTAMINATED, THE--
THE FRUIT IS DRYING.

05:15.248 --> 05:19.786
AND AFTER, WE CAN'T USE IT,
BECAUSE THERE IS NO JUICE,
NOTHING.
>> Stahl: AND YOU ATTRIBUTE THIS

05:19.852 --> 05:24.490
TO CLIMATE CHANGE?
>> Sevillano: YES.
BECAUSE IT WAS SO EXTREME.
IT'S NOT NORMAL.

05:24.557 --> 05:32.965
>> Stahl: THIS YEAR'S EXTREME
WEATHER NOT ONLY BATTERED
CHAMPAGNE AND THE FOUNDATION OF
ITS ECONOMY, BUT NEARLY EVERY

05:33.032 --> 05:40.673
ONE OF THE WINE-PRODUCING
REGIONS IN FRANCE-- BURGUNDY TO
BORDEAUX, WHERE SOME OF THE
HIGHEST QUALITY, BEST-KNOWN

05:40.740 --> 05:45.078
AND BEST-TASTING REDS AND WHITES
ARE MADE.
AND THESE ARE WHAT GRAPE?
WHAT, WHAT--

05:45.144 --> 05:50.116
>> Jacques Lurton: THIS IS
MERLOT.
>> Stahl: MERLOT!
I LOVE MERLOT.

05:50.183 --> 05:57.824
>> Lurton: YEAH, MERLOT MAKES A
BEAUTIFUL, SOFT-ROUNDED WINES.
>> Stahl: JACQUES LURTON, THE
HEAD OF A WINE FAMILY DYNASTY,

05:57.890 --> 06:04.630
RUNS THE CHATEAU LA LOUVIERE AND
SEVERAL OTHER WINERIES IN
BORDEAUX.
HE SAYS VINE DISEASE IS GETTING

06:04.697 --> 06:11.838
WORSE ALL OVER FRANCE BECAUSE OF
THE RISING TEMPERATURES.
>> Lurton: WE DON'T HAVE WINTERS
ANYMORE, ALMOST.

06:11.904 --> 06:18.377
IN WINTERTIME, NORMALLY YOU GET
COLDER CONDITIONS.
THESE COOL CONDITIONS TEND TO
KILL THE FUNGUSES OR THE

06:18.444 --> 06:27.687
DISEASE.
SO NORMALLY, WINTER CLEANS THE
SITUATION, YOU SEE?
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM

06:27.754 --> 06:34.460
THAT WE HAVE IS WHAT WE CALL
SPRING FROST.
>> Stahl: SPRING FROST WAS SO
SEVERE IN APRIL THIS YEAR THAT

06:34.527 --> 06:42.468
WINEGROWERS WERE ON THEIR KNEES
LIGHTING BALES OF HAY AND
CANDLES BETWEEN THEIR VINES IN A
MOSTLY FUTILE ATTEMPT TO PROTECT

06:42.535 --> 06:47.807
THEIR YOUNG BUDS.
>> Lurton: IT IS THE LARGEST
CATASTROPHE WE HAVE EVER
SUFFERED.

06:47.874 --> 06:57.283
BECAUSE, BEFORE, WE HAD SOME
SPRING FROST IN SOME REGIONS,
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE
HAVE IT ALL OVER FRANCE.

06:57.350 --> 07:05.458
NOW, DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE
DON'T HAVE THESE VERY STRONG
WINTERS, THE BUDS START TO OPEN,
AND THEN EXPOSE THEMSELF TO THIS

07:05.525 --> 07:10.263
SERIES OF SPRING FROST THAT WE
HAVE.
>> Stahl: AND THAT IS THE CRUX--
>> Lurton: AND THAT, YOU SEE, IS

07:10.329 --> 07:21.240
WHAT AFFECT THE MOST THE
QUANTITY OF THE GRAPES.
>> Stahl: SO, TELL US ABOUT THIS
YEAR, IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT.

07:21.307 --> 07:27.980
>> Lurton: IN AVERAGE, IN FRANCE
THIS YEAR, A LOSS OF 30%.
>> Stahl: 30% OF THE YIELDS.
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

07:28.047 --> 07:32.685
WHAT'S YOUR PERCENT?
>> Lurton: AND US, WE HAVE BEEN
AFFECTED UP TO 40%.
>> Stahl: SO, YOU'RE ONE OF THE

07:32.752 --> 07:38.391
LARGEST WINE PRODUCERS IN
BORDEAUX.
40% LOSS.
I MEAN, THAT'S ENORMOUS.

07:38.457 --> 07:46.265
>> Lurton: IT'S HUGE.
IT'S HUGE.
>> Stahl: FOR BORDEAUX, HE
ESTIMATES A LOSS OF ROUGHLY

07:46.332 --> 07:52.805
$800 MILLION IN SALES THIS YEAR.
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S
HAPPENING ALL OVER EUROPE OR--
OR JUST FRANCE?

07:52.872 --> 07:57.143
>> Greg Jones: NO.
IT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER EUROPE,
DEFINITELY.
>> Stahl: GREG JONES IS A

07:57.210 --> 08:05.184
RESEARCH CLIMATOLOGIST WITH
SOUTHERN OREGON UNIVERSITY, WHO
FOR 25 YEARS HAS SPECIALIZED IN
THE STUDY OF HOW CLIMATE

08:05.251 --> 08:11.958
INFLUENCES THE GROWING AND
HARVESTING OF WINE GRAPES.
>> Jones: WHAT WE'RE SEEING
TODAY IS, WE'RE SEEING MORE OF

08:12.024 --> 08:16.162
THESE EXTREME EVENTS HAPPENING
MORE FREQUENTLY AT GREATER
DEGREES AND CAUSING MORE
PROBLEMS.

08:16.229 --> 08:20.600
>> Stahl: YEAH, WE SEE IT
EVERYWHERE.
IT'S NOT JUST IN FARM REGIONS.
I MEAN, EVERY PART OF OUR

08:20.666 --> 08:29.976
COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING SOME
EXTREME WEATHER CONDITION.
SO, HOW DO YOU KNOW IT ISN'T
THAT "NORMAL" EXTREME WEATHER,

08:30.042 --> 08:35.615
AS OPPOSED TO A GENERAL CLIMATE
CHANGE?
>> Jones: THERE'S AN AREA IN
CLIMATE SCIENCE CALLED

08:35.681 --> 08:42.588
ATTRIBUTION SCIENCE.
AND ATTRIBUTION SCIENCE IS ALL
ABOUT TRYING TO KIND OF
UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH ROLE HUMANS

08:42.655 --> 08:46.325
HAVE IN THE GAME OF CLIMATE.
SO, THE IDEA--
>> Stahl: OR WHO TO ATTRIBUTE T
TO, OKAY.

08:46.392 --> 08:53.966
>> Jones: YEAH, YEAH.
SO, WHAT CLIMATOLOGISTS DO IS,
WE DEVELOP MODELS THAT LOOK AT
ASPECTS OF CLIMATE.

08:54.033 --> 09:00.006
AND THOSE MODELS THAT ARE COMING
OUT ARE REALLY TELLING US MORE
AND MORE THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF
HUMANS, MOST OF THESE THINGS

09:00.072 --> 09:05.478
WOULD NOT OCCUR TO THE SAME
DEGREE THEY'RE OCCURRING TODAY.
>> Stahl: TIE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
ABOUT CLIMATE TO WHAT'S GOING ON

09:05.544 --> 09:10.383
IN FRANCE NOW.
>> Jones: SURE.
IN-- IN-- IN FRANCE, JUST LIKE
MOST OF EUROPE, TEMPERATURES

09:10.449 --> 09:14.954
HAVE GONE UP.
SUMMERS HAVE GOTTEN DRYER.
AND WINE GRAPES ARE JUST
SENSITIVE.

09:15.021 --> 09:22.295
THEY'RE SENSITIVE TO THOSE KIND
OF CHANGES, AND-- AND WE'VE BEEN
SEEING IT WORLDWIDE.
AND EUROPE HAS BEEN AT THE

09:22.361 --> 09:30.036
EPICENTER OF IT.
>> Stahl: THIS WEATHER MAP OF
EUROPE FOR JUNE 2021, THE
SECOND-WARMEST JUNE IN EUROPE ON

09:30.102 --> 09:38.377
RECORD, SHOWS A RED BAND
DEPICTING HIGH SURFACE AIR
TEMPERATURES STRETCHING ACROSS
MUCH OF THE CONTINENT.

09:38.444 --> 09:46.452
HEAT WAVES WERE ALSO RECORDED
OVER WESTERN NORTH AMERICA IN
JUNE 2021.
SCORCHING TEMPERATURES AND

09:46.519 --> 09:58.397
DROUGHT CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTED
TO WILDFIRES IN 2020 AROUND NAPA
AND SONOMA, THE CENTER OF
AMERICA'S WINE INDUSTRY, WHERE

09:58.464 --> 10:05.771
FIELDS WERE LEFT BLACKENED.
IN AUSTRALIA, THE BUSH FIRES OF
2019 AND '20 BURNT SOME
VINEYARDS TO THE GROUND, WHILE

10:05.838 --> 10:16.015
SMOKE RUINED THE QUALITY OF THE
GRAPES.
IN 2017, IN ITALY, SPRING FROST,
COMBINED WITH HAILSTORMS AND A

10:16.082 --> 10:20.953
HEAT WAVE KNOWN AS “LUCIFER,”
LED TO THE LOWEST HARVEST IN
DECADES.
PARTICULARLY HARD HIT WAS

10:21.020 --> 10:29.829
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL ITALY,
WHERE PROSECCO, BAROLO AND
CHIANTI ARE MADE.
AND IN PARTS OF CHILE AND

10:29.895 --> 10:35.067
ARGENTINA, HIGHER TEMPERATURES
ARE PUSHING WINE-GROWERS TO
PLANT THEIR VINEYARDS AT
HIGHER ALTITUDES, WHERE

10:35.134 --> 10:42.742
TEMPERATURES ARE COOLER.
GREG JONES SAYS THE WARMING
ATMOSPHERE IS ALSO CHANGING THE
GRAPES' GROWTH CYCLE.

10:42.808 --> 10:49.181
>> Jones: IT ACCELERATES THAT
RIPENING TO THE POINT THAT WE'RE
PICKING EARLIER.
FOR EXAMPLE, 2020, IN BURGUNDY,

10:49.248 --> 10:58.024
THE PICKING DATE WAS AUGUST 20.
AND PRIOR TO THAT, WE'VE BEEN
AVERAGING FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS,
ABOUT SEPTEMBER 15.

10:58.090 --> 11:03.396
AND THEN, FOR 600 YEARS BEFORE
THAT, WE WERE AVERAGING THE END
OF SEPTEMBER, FIRST OF OCTOBER.
SO, YOU CAN--

11:03.462 --> 11:10.436
>> Stahl: OH, SO IT'S DRAMATIC.
>> Jones: SO IT'S PRETTY
DRAMATIC.
>> Stahl: THESE PAGES OF

11:10.503 --> 11:14.774
PARCHMENT, DOCUMENTING HARVEST
DATES GOING BACK AS FAR AS 1354,
WERE FOUND IN THE CHURCH OF
NOTRE DAME IN BURGUNDY.

11:14.840 --> 11:22.381
1354.
>> Jones: IT'S A WONDERFUL DATA
RECORD THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO
LOOK AT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

11:22.448 --> 11:27.686
WHAT CLIMATES WERE LIKE BACK
THEN, HOW IT AFFECTED HARVESTS,
AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE TODAY.
>> Stahl: I'M SMILING BECAUSE

11:27.753 --> 11:34.460
I'M THINKING, 1300s.
I'M THINKING, THE MONKS WERE
MAKING WINE.
>> Jones: WELL, EXACTLY.

11:34.527 --> 11:40.499
>> Stahl: THE WINE INDUSTRY IN
FRANCE IS SO VITAL TO THE
ECONOMY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS
SCIENTISTS STUDYING WAYS TO

11:40.566 --> 11:50.443
ADAPT AND MITIGATE THE CHANGING
ENVIRONMENT.
ONE ROUTE TO ADAPTATION IS TO
INTRODUCE NEW GRAPE VARIETIES.

11:50.509 --> 11:58.451
EXPERIMENTAL VINEYARDS HAVE BEEN
PLANTED WITH VINES FROM WARMER-
CLIMATE COUNTRIES TO SEE IF THEY
CAN GROW HERE, SO THE GRAPES CAN

11:58.517 --> 12:05.825
BE BLENDED IN WITH THE MERLOTS,
CABERNETS AND OTHER FRENCH
WINES.
NATHALIE OLLAT IS THE DIRECTOR

12:05.891 --> 12:12.164
OF THE PROJECT AT THE BORDEAUX
SCIENCE INSTITUTE OF VINE AND
WINE.
SO, YOU'RE LOOKING AT GRAPES

12:12.231 --> 12:16.936
THAT COME FROM SOUTHERN REGIONS
THAT MAYBE GROW BETTER IN WARMER
CLIMATES?
>> Nathalie Ollat: YES.

12:17.002 --> 12:22.508
>> Stahl: LIKE FROM WHERE?
>> Ollat: FROM SPAIN, FROM
PORTUGAL, FROM GREECE.
>> Stahl: HOW MANY ARE YOU

12:22.575 --> 12:29.381
ACTUALLY LOOKING AT?
>> Ollat: SO, IN THIS
EXPERIMENTAL VINEYARD, WE ARE
STUDYING 52 DIFFERENT VARIETIES.

12:29.448 --> 12:36.055
>> Stahl: THEY'VE CHOSEN SIX OF
THOSE VARIETIES THUS FAR TO BE
PLANTED IN BORDEAUX.
SO, THIS IS YOUR GREENHOUSE?

12:36.122 --> 12:41.961
>> Ollat: YES.
THIS-- IT IS.
>> Stahl: A SECOND ROUTE OF
ADAPTATION IS GENETIC BREEDING.

12:42.027 --> 12:48.167
ARE YOU ACTUALLY CREATING NEW
GRAPES; NEW, DIFFERENT KINDS OF
GRAPES?
>> Ollat: YES.

12:48.234 --> 12:58.711
THE IDEA IS TO HAVE GRAPES, NEW
VARIETIES WHICH CAN BE RESISTANT
TO DISEASE AND ALSO MORE ADAPTED
TO CLIMATE CHANGE CONDITION.

12:58.777 --> 13:06.819
>> Stahl: AND DO NOT COMPROMISE
THE DISTINCTIVE QUALITIES OF THE
FRENCH WINES.
AT THE INSTITUTE'S LABORATORY,

13:06.886 --> 13:12.858
SCIENTISTS ARE STUDYING THE
GENETICS OF WINE'S COLOR, AROMA
AND TASTE.
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

13:12.925 --> 13:18.531
PRESERVE EVEN AS YOU INTRODUCE
NEW GRAPES?
>> Ollat: YES.
I THINK WE-- WE WANT TO CHANGE

13:18.597 --> 13:24.770
WITHOUT CHANGING, I WOULD SAY.
>> Stahl: YES!
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO CRACK THE

13:24.837 --> 13:34.113
PUZZLE; YOU'RE GOING TO
FIGURE OUT HOW TO STAY AHEAD OF
CLIMATE CHANGE?
>> Ollat: ALL TOGETHER, WITH

13:34.180 --> 13:42.855
NEW VARIETIES, NEW GROWING
PRACTICE, I THINK WE CAN-- WE
CAN COPE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE, AT
LEAST UNTIL THE-- THE MIDDLE OF

13:42.922 --> 13:48.227
THE 21st CENTURY.
>> Stahl: THE MIDDLE OF THE
CENTURY IS ONLY 30 YEARS FROM
NOW.

13:48.294 --> 13:54.433
>> Ollat: YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stahl: SO, YOU'RE LOOKING AT
HOW FAST TEMPERATURES ARE
RISING, AND YOU'RE SAYING IT'S

13:54.500 --> 14:03.676
POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL RISE
ABOVE A POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T...
>> Ollat: THAT IT-- IT-- IT WILL
BE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED TO KEEP

14:03.742 --> 14:10.649
WHAT WE CALL BORDEAUX STYLE AND
BORDEAUX TASTE.
>> Stahl: WITH ALL THE GLOOM AND
DOOM ABOUT WARMING TEMPERATURES

14:10.716 --> 14:18.524
IN WINE COUNTRY, THERE'S
ACTUALLY A SURPRISING UPSIDE.
WHAT ABOUT QUALITY?
WHAT ABOUT THE TASTE?

14:18.591 --> 14:26.665
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT WINE?
HOW IS CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTING
THAT?
>> Lurton:<i> ALORS,</i> THE CLIMATE

14:26.732 --> 14:33.172
CHANGE IS AFFECTING THE QUALITY
VERY POSITIVELY.
>> Stahl: POSITIVELY?
>> Lurton: YES, EX-- EXACTLY.

14:33.239 --> 14:38.644
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A LARGE
QUANTITY OF GOOD VINTAGES OF
BORDEAUX WINES.
>> Stahl: WELL, EXPLAIN THAT.

14:38.711 --> 14:47.453
THAT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE.
>> Lurton: THANKS TO THE GLOBAL
WARMING AND THE CLIMATE CHANGE,
NOW WE HAVE WARMER SUMMERS AND

14:47.519 --> 14:54.860
WHICH MEANS THAT OUR GRAPES ARE
RIPENING BETTER.
IF WE GET GOOD, WARM CONDITIONS,
WE HAVE GOOD COLOR QUANTITY IN

14:54.927 --> 15:04.737
THE-- IN THE SKIN.
BUT, AS WELL, WE HAVE THE RIGHT
AMOUNT OF SUGAR.
>> Stahl: WHAT A PAINFUL IRONY--

15:04.803 --> 15:09.375
THE TASTE IMPROVES JUST AS THE
YIELDS ARE SHRINKING FOR
WINEMAKERS LIKE CHRISTINE
SEVILLANO.

15:09.441 --> 15:14.713
SO, MORE QUALITY, BUT FEWER
GRAPES.
DRAMATICALLY FEWER GRAPES.
>> Sevillano: YES.

15:14.780 --> 15:22.421
IT'S CRAZY.
>> Stahl: IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER
YEAR LIKE THIS ONE, FINANCIALLY,
CAN YOU SURVIVE?

15:22.488 --> 15:29.595
>> Sevillano: IT WILL BE
DIFFICULT.
REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M

15:29.662 --> 15:37.002
TRUSTFUL FOR NEXT YEAR.
I MEAN, I'M TRUSTFUL.
I HAVE TO.
>> Stahl: IMPROVED TASTE IS NOT

15:37.069 --> 15:45.577
THE ONLY UNFORESEEN BENEFIT OF
CLIMATE CHANGE FOR SOME
WINEMAKERS.
HOW IT'S AFFECTING THE BUBBLY

15:45.644 --> 15:54.820
YOU ARE LIKELY TO ENJOY ON NEW
YEAR'S EVE, WHEN WE RETURN.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

15:56.221 --> 16:03.095
>> Stahl: FOR SOME WINEGROWERS,
CLIMATE CHANGE HAS BEEN A
DISASTER, AS WE'VE SEEN.
BUT, AS IT TURNS OUT,

16:03.162 --> 16:09.435
CLIMATE CHANGE HAS BEEN A BOON
FOR OTHERS.
WHILE HIGHER TEMPERATURES HAVE
HURT GROWERS IN FRANCE AND

16:09.501 --> 16:16.575
ITALY, FOR INSTANCE, PLACES THAT
HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN TOO COLD
TO PRODUCE QUALITY WINES ARE
NOW TURNING OUT CONSISTENTLY

16:16.642 --> 16:25.351
GOOD ONES.
PLACES LIKE ENGLAND.
THE NOTION THAT IN ENGLAND THE
ONLY BEVERAGE IS LUKEWARM ALE AT

16:25.417 --> 16:34.593
THE PUB IS WOEFULLY OUTDATED.
TODAY, A NEW INDUSTRY HAS TAKEN
ROOT.
HEALTHY VINEYARDS IN ENGLAND ARE

16:34.660 --> 16:41.133
PRODUCING SOME OF THE WORLD'S
BEST WINES.
THIS SPRAWLING VINEYARD WITH
ACRES AND ACRES OF WINE GRAPES

16:41.200 --> 16:50.843
READY FOR HARVEST IS LOCATED IN
KENT, 40 MILES OUTSIDE OF
LONDON.
IT DIDN'T EXIST 15 YEARS AGO,

16:50.909 --> 16:56.949
BUT GREAT BRITAIN'S WINE-
PRODUCING FORTUNES HAVE BEEN
HEATING UP, ALONG WITH THE
PLANET.

16:57.015 --> 17:02.988
SO, HOW HAS CLIMATE CHANGE
AFFECTED THE GRAPES, THE WINE,
IN THIS REGION?
>> Stephen Skelton: WELL, IT'S

17:03.055 --> 17:08.994
COMPLETELY REVOLUTIONIZED IT.
>> Stahl: STEPHEN SKELTON, A
MEMBER OF THE HIGHLY-RESPECTED
INSTITUTE OF MASTERS OF WINE, IS

17:09.061 --> 17:16.602
A VITICULTURIST, AN EXPERT IN
THE SCIENCE, PRODUCTION, AND
BUSINESS OF WINE GRAPES.
I NEVER HEARD OF REALLY GOOD

17:16.668 --> 17:20.339
ENGLISH WINE, I HAVE TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.
>> Skelton: NO, IT WAS-- IT WAS
VERY, VERY RARE, UNTIL WE

17:20.406 --> 17:25.444
REALIZED THAT YOU COULD GROW
THESE CLASSIC FRENCH CHAMPAGNE
VARIETIES IN-- IN OUR CLIMATE.
>> Stahl: THIS IS WHAT THEY GROW

17:25.511 --> 17:33.018
IN CHAMPAGNE?
>> Skelton: YEAH.
AND THEY NOW GROW VERY, VERY
SUCCESSFULLY HERE IN THE U.K.

17:33.085 --> 17:40.492
>> Stahl: WHAT USED TO BE A
MINUTE COTTAGE INDUSTRY RUN BY
RETIREES AND GENTLEMAN FARMERS
IS TODAY ONE OF THE FASTEST

17:40.559 --> 17:44.363
WINE-GROWING REGIONS IN THE
WORLD.
THIS IS QUITE AN OPERATION GOING
ON.

17:44.430 --> 17:52.704
>> Skelton: OH, IT'S BIG.
IT'S A BIG WINERY.
>> Stahl: IN 2018, THE VINTAGE
IN ENGLAND WAS SO BOUNTIFUL THAT

17:52.771 --> 17:59.044
SOME VINEYARDS HAD TO SCRAMBLE
TO BUY VATS AND TANKS TO HOLD IT
ALL.
OTHERS SIMPLY THREW GRAPES AWAY.

17:59.111 --> 18:05.484
BY THE END OF THE DECADE,
WINEMAKERS HERE WILL PRODUCE AN
ESTIMATED 20 MILLION BOTTLES A
YEAR.

18:05.551 --> 18:11.323
>> Skelton: THE FOUNDATION OF
TODAY'S INDUSTRY IS THE FACT
THAT WE CAN GROW THESE
VARIETIES, WHICH WE COULDN'T

18:11.390 --> 18:15.761
GROW EARLIER.
>> Stahl: SO, WHY COULDN'T YOU
DO IT BEFORE?
>> Skelton: BECAUSE THE-- THE

18:15.828 --> 18:19.064
CLIMATE WAS TOO COLD.
>> Stahl: YOU JUST HAD TO GET
THE TEMPERATURE UP AND--
>> Skelton: YEAH.

18:19.131 --> 18:24.036
>> Stahl: SO, DOES GLOBAL
WARMING MEAN THAT ENGLAND NOW
HAS MORE DAYS FOR THE GRAPES TO
RIPEN?

18:24.102 --> 18:30.209
IS THAT--
>> Skelton: YEAH, BECAUSE WE
HAVE MORE DAYS OVER 85, 86
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

18:30.275 --> 18:37.716
WE ARE-- WE ARE IN THE U.K. NOW.
WE'RE NOW WHERE CHAMPAGNE WAS
30 OR 40 YEARS AGO.
THE CLIMATE HAS SHIFTED IN 30 OR

18:37.783 --> 18:45.557
40 YEARS UPWARDS; NORTH.
NORTHWARDS.
>> Stahl: SO, THE CLIMATE, RIGHT
NOW, WHERE YOU AND I ARE SITTING

18:45.624 --> 18:49.394
IN ENGLAND, IS THE SAME AS THE
CLIMATE WAS 40 YEARS AGO IN
FRANCE.
>> Skelton: IN CHAMPAGNE.

18:49.461 --> 18:53.365
>> Stahl: IN CHAMPAGNE, FRANCE.
>> Skelton: IN CHAMPAGNE.
YEAH.
>> Stahl: HE TRACES THE BIRTH OF

18:53.432 --> 19:01.139
THE INDUSTRY HERE TO 1988.
>> Skelton: THEN THERE CAME
TWO AMERICANS, THE MOSSES--
STUART AND SANDY MOSS.

19:01.206 --> 19:06.411
THEY BOUGHT AN ESTATE CALLED
NYETIMBER, WHICH IS VERY
WELL-KNOWN TODAY, AND THEY
WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO PLANT A

19:06.478 --> 19:10.048
BIG, COMMERCIAL VINEYARD.
>> Stahl: WHAT DID YOU THINK?
>> Skelton: I THOUGHT THEY WERE
BONKERS.

19:10.115 --> 19:14.119
I HAVE TO SAY.
>> Stahl: OKAY.
>> Skelton: YEAH, I THOUGHT THEY
WERE NUTS.

19:14.186 --> 19:20.492
I HEARD THEY WERE RICH AMERICANS
FROM UP IN THE HILLS.
AND HE HAD A FORTUNE FROM,
APPARENTLY, DENTAL.

19:20.559 --> 19:26.665
THE DENTAL BUSINESS.
AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE MAD.
THEIR FIRST WINE TOOK-- TOOK A
LONG WHILE TO MATURE.

19:26.732 --> 19:30.235
IT WAS FOUR YEARS IN THE MAKING
BEFORE IT WAS TASTED.
AND THEN IT WON THIS MAJOR
PRIZE.

19:30.302 --> 19:35.240
>> Stahl: RIGHT AWAY?
FOUR YEARS.
>> Skelton: YEAH, YEAH.
AND THE NEXT YEAR, THE

19:35.307 --> 19:43.649
SECOND YEAR, THEY WON AN EVEN
BIGGER PRIZE.
>> Stahl: ARE YOU THINKING THAT
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, THE

19:43.715 --> 19:47.753
ENGLISH SPARKLING WINE WILL BE
ACTUALLY BETTER THAN WHAT
THEY'RE GROWING IN CHAMPAGNE?
>> Skelton: THEY PRODUCE 300

19:47.819 --> 19:52.491
MILLION BOTTLES A YEAR.
THE BEST IS STILL VERY, VERY
GOOD.
THE BEST IS SUPERB.

19:52.558 --> 19:58.797
BUT YOU COULD LINE UP THE BEST
TEN ENGLISH SPARKLING WINES
AGAINST THE BEST TEN CHAMPAGNES
IN THE SAME SORT OF PRIZE

19:58.864 --> 20:05.470
CATEGORY; I CAN GUARANTEE YOU
THE ENGLISH WINES WOULD BE--
WOULD BE IN THE TOP HALF.
>> Stahl: TO PROVE HIS POINT,

20:05.537 --> 20:10.809
HE GAVE US A TASTE, OPENING A
TEN-YEAR-OLD BOTTLE.
>> Skelton: WE'RE GOING TO OPEN
IT... PROFESSIONALLY.

20:10.876 --> 20:16.815
>> Stahl: OH, NO POP!
>> Skelton: NO POP.
>> Stahl: LOOK AT THAT!
THE LONGER SPARKLING WINE AGES,

20:16.882 --> 20:23.121
HE SAYS, THE BETTER.
AND WHAT YOU LOOK FOR IS THE
SPRITZ OF FIZZ ON THE PALETTE.
>> Skelton: YOU SEE, YOU'VE GOT

20:23.188 --> 20:26.758
THE BUBBLES COMING FROM THERE.
>> Stahl: AND THAT'S A GOOD
THING.
>> Skelton: YEAH.

20:26.825 --> 20:31.263
YOU SEE, THEY'RE NICE AND SMALL.
AND THEN, YOU NOSE IT.
YOU GET A NICE, YEASTY
CHARACTER.

20:31.330 --> 20:39.838
BAKING BREAD--
BRIOCHE, AS WE CALL IT.
AND THAT'S A GORGEOUS, GORGEOUS
BOTTLE OF WINE.

20:39.905 --> 20:45.510
>> Stahl: WINSTON CHURCHILL ONCE
SAID, “I COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT
CHAMPAGNE.
IN VICTORY, I DESERVE IT;

20:45.577 --> 20:55.754
IN DEFEAT, I NEED IT!"
WELL, NOTHING WOULD HAVE PLEASED
HIM MORE THAN TO HEAR THAT
BECAUSE ENGLISH BUBBLY IS NOW SO

20:55.821 --> 21:03.362
GOOD, THE HOUSE OF TAITTINGER--
ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS OF
FRENCH CHAMPAGNE MAKERS-- IS IN
ENGLAND!

21:03.428 --> 21:09.201
IT'S NOW GROWING 120 ACRES OF
GRAPES AND IS MAKING SPARKLING
WINE NEAR CANTERBURY, IN
WHAT'S KNOWN AS “THE GARDEN OF

21:09.267 --> 21:16.875
ENGLAND.”
PATRICK McGRATH, WHO REPRESENTS
TAITTINGER IN GREAT BRITAIN,
PERSUADED THE COMPANY TO INVEST

21:16.942 --> 21:22.214
HERE IN 2015.
HAVE YOU BROUGHT THE GRAPES FROM
FRANCE?
>> Patrick McGrath: YEAH.

21:22.280 --> 21:31.456
THE-- THE VINES WERE IMPORTED
FROM FRANCE AS-- AS TINY, LITTLE
VINES, AND THE FIRST CROP WE HAD
FROM THEM WAS IN 2020.

21:31.523 --> 21:40.532
AND THEN, THAT WINE WILL BE
RELEASED AT THE END OF 2024.
>> Stahl: YOU KNOW, IN-- IN
FRANCE, PART OF THE PROBLEM IS

21:40.599 --> 21:46.738
NOT JUST WARMING; IT'S<i> EXTREME</i>
WEATHER CONDITIONS.
YOU KNOW, TOO MUCH FLOODING, TOO
MUCH FROST, TOO HOT.

21:46.805 --> 21:52.878
WON'T ENGLAND ALSO HAVE EXTREME
SITUATIONS LIKE THAT?
>> McGrath: NOT AT THE MOMENT.
WE'RE FORTUNATE, YOU KNOW.

21:52.944 --> 22:00.052
ENGLAND IS COMING ONTO THE RADAR
AS BEING AN AREA THAT IS
WARMING, BUT IS STILL MODERATE
IN TERMS OF HEAT, COMPARED TO

22:00.118 --> 22:08.827
SOUTH AND CENTRAL EUROPE, WHERE
IT'S BECOMING VERY, VERY HOT.
>> Stahl: DO YOU THINK THAT WINE
LOVERS AROUND THE WORLD ALREADY

22:08.894 --> 22:15.734
KNOW THAT GREAT WINES ARE COMING
OUT OF ENGLAND?
IN OTHER WORDS--
IS IT "OOH, LA LA" NO MORE?

22:15.801 --> 22:22.841
IT'S "JOLLY GOOD"?
>> McGrath: I THINK-- I THINK
IN-- WE'RE STILL AT THE, SORT
OF-- IN THE STARTING BLOCK.

22:22.908 --> 22:29.448
BUT, CERTAINLY, YES.
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THE--
FROM A SMALL BASE, THE SALES OF
ENGLISH HAVE BEEN GROWING

22:29.514 --> 22:40.659
SUBSTANTIALLY.
>> Stahl: TAITTINGER'S AIM IS TO
PRODUCE 300,000 BOTTLES A YEAR
BY 2025.

22:40.726 --> 22:46.598
OVERALL, THE ENGLISH WINE
INDUSTRY HAD $220 MILLION IN
SALES LAST YEAR.
THE IDEA OF FIRST-RATE ENGLISH

22:46.665 --> 22:57.342
WINE WOULD HAVE BEEN LAUGHED AT
20 YEARS AGO, BUT A SIMILAR
MIGRATION HAS HAPPENED ON THE
WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES,

22:57.409 --> 23:08.286
WHEE EXCELLENT AND INCREASINGLY
POPULAR PINOT AND CHARDONNAY
GRAPES ARE NOW FOUND 560 MILES
NORTH OF NAPA, IN

23:08.353 --> 23:13.358
WILLAMETTE VALLEY, OREGON.
>> Greg Jones: IN THE 1950s AND
'60s, THERE WERE REALLY ALMOST
NO GRAPES GROWN IN OREGON.

23:13.425 --> 23:17.496
AND THAT WAS BECAUSE THE
CLIMATES WERE TOO COLD.
AND SO, IF YOU FAST FORWARD TO
WHERE WE ARE TODAY, WE'RE JUST

23:17.562 --> 23:25.036
IN A DIFFERENT WORLD.
>> Stahl: GREG JONES, A WINE
CLIMATOLOGIST AT SOUTHERN
OREGON UNIVERSITY, SAYS GRAPES

23:25.103 --> 23:32.577
ARE NOW GROWING IN EVEN MORE
UNEXPECTED PLACES.
>> Jones: WE HAVE WINERIES TODAY
IN NORWAY, IN QUEBEC, IN-- IN

23:32.644 --> 23:37.349
BRITISH COLUMBIA, IN TASMANIA,
IN-- IN THE SOUTH ISLANDS OF--
OF CHILE.
>> Stahl: TASMANIAN WINE.

23:37.415 --> 23:41.720
>> Jones: YEAH, TASMANIA'S
REALLY BEEN BURGEONING AS REALLY
A GREAT WINE-PRODUCING REGION IN
AUSTRALIA.

23:41.787 --> 23:47.993
>> Stahl: OH, WELL, THAT'S
INTERESTING.
TASMANIA IS SOUTH OF AUSTRALIA.
>> Jones: SURE.

23:48.059 --> 23:52.831
>> Stahl: SO, AS WINEMAKING GOES
NORTH IN THE NORTHERN
HEMISPHERE, ARE YOU SAYING IT'S
GOING SOUTH...

23:52.898 --> 23:55.200
>> Jones: SOUTH.
YES, YEAH.
>> Stahl: ...IN THE SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE?

23:55.267 --> 24:04.242
>> Jones: YEAH.
IT'S GOING FURTHER POLEWARD IN
BOTH HEMISPHERES.
IN PARTS OF SOUTHERN ARGENTINA

24:04.309 --> 24:09.414
AND CHILE, AND-- AND PARTS OF--
MANY PARTS OF NORTHERN EUROPE
HAVE STARTED GROWING GRAPES.
>> Stahl: IN REAL TIME.

24:09.481 --> 24:16.254
>> Jones: IN REAL TIME.
>> Stahl: SO, IF YOU REALLY WANT
A VERY VIVID "NOW" EXAMPLE OF
WHAT'S HAPPENING DUE TO CLIMATE

24:16.321 --> 24:22.060
CHANGE, GO LOOK AT WINE.
>> Jones: YEAH, YOU CAN.
PEOPLE ARE EXPERIMENTING AT-- AT
NORTHERLY LATITUDES, THAT--

24:22.127 --> 24:31.336
I'M AMAZED THAT IN MY CAREER I
DIDN'T THINK I WOULD SEE IT.
>> Stahl: IN THE UNITED KINGDOM,
AS A MEASURE OF ITS ACCEPTANCE,

24:31.403 --> 24:37.843
ENGLISH SPARKLING WINE HAS HAD
THE ROYAL IMPRIMATUR, THE QUEEN
SERVING IT AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
AND IT WAS POURED AT THE RECENT

24:37.909 --> 24:47.085
CLIMATE CHANGE SUMMIT IN
SCOTLAND.
MASTER OF WINE STEPHEN SKELTON
IS BULLISH ON THE FUTURE.

24:47.152 --> 24:55.227
IF GLOBAL WARMING IS
INTENSIFYING, HOW WORRIED ARE
YOU AND THE OTHER ENGLISH
VINTNERS THAT IT'S GOING TO MOVE

24:55.293 --> 24:58.864
NORTH BEYOND YOUR ABILITY TO
GROW GOOD GRAPES?
>> Stephen Skelton: NO, I'M NOT
WORRIED AT ALL.

24:58.930 --> 25:02.534
I MEAN, THE NEXT 40 YEARS IS
GOING TO BE FASCINATING, I
THINK.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST ON

25:02.601 --> 25:06.805
THE CUSP OF IT BEING REALLY
COMMERCIAL.
OUR YIELD LEVELS ARE NOT QUITE
WHERE WE WANT THEM YET.

25:06.872 --> 25:13.478
YOU KNOW, WE WOULD LIKE A LITTLE
BIT MORE HEAT.
>> Stahl: YOU MIGHT GET IT.
>> Skelton: YEAH.

25:13.545 --> 25:18.783
>> Stahl: BUT EVENTUALLY...
>> Skelton: WHO KNOWS?
WE'LL HAVE TO START GROWING
ORANGES AND BANANAS.

25:18.850 --> 25:22.621
>> Stahl: I MEAN, IT'S A SERIOUS
QUESTION.
>> Skelton: YEAH.
PERSONALLY, I THINK WE WILL

25:22.687 --> 25:29.127
COPE WITH-- WITH WHAT'S BEING
THROWN AT US.
>> Stahl: SOME OF THE WINEMAKERS
WE MET ARE BENEFITING, SOME ARE

25:29.194 --> 25:35.767
SUFFERING, BUT ALL ARE SEEING
FIRST-HAND THE MESSAGE THAT
CLIMATE CHANGE IS DELIVERING.
>> Jones: WINE GRAPES HAVE OFTEN

25:35.834 --> 25:41.439
BEEN CALLED THE CANARY IN THE
COAL MINE.
>> Stahl: CLIMATOLOGIST GREG
JONES SAYS THAT'S BEEN TRUE

25:41.506 --> 25:52.651
SINCE THE FIRST WINE WAS MADE IN
6000 B.C. IN EASTERN EUROPE, AND
THEN SPREAD TO ANCIENT EGYPT,
GREECE, AND PERSIA.

25:52.717 --> 25:57.555
KINGS CELEBRATED THEIR VICTORIES
WITH WINE, AND THE CHRISTIAN
WORLD PUT IT AT THE HEART OF THE
EUCHARIST.

25:57.622 --> 26:04.863
WINE HISTORY, JONES SAYS, IS
HUMAN HISTORY.
>> Jones: WINE TOUCHES SOCIETY
IN SOME PRETTY POWERFUL WAYS.

26:04.930 --> 26:13.305
IT'S RELATED TO CIVILIZATIONS.
IT'S RELATED TO HISTORY.
IT'S RELATED TO GEOGRAPHY.
IT'S RELATED TO ROMANTICISM,

26:13.371 --> 26:21.146
ART, GASTRONOMY, BIOLOGY,
CHEMISTRY.
SO, THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT
ARE TIED TO IT THAT IT BECOMES

26:21.212 --> 26:28.186
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN-- WE CAN
TELL THE STORY OF CLIMATE CHANGE
THROUGH WINE PRETTY EASILY.

<i>WORLD.</i>

26:40.065 --> 26:41.766
(<i> TICKING</i> )

26:43.935 --> 26:52.344
>> Wertheim: WE'RE 40 DAYS AWAY
FROM THE 2022 WINTER OLYMPICS IN
BEIJING-- GAMES THAT COME
WREATHED IN CONTROVERSY.

26:52.410 --> 27:00.518
TO MANY, CHINA IS A PROBLEMATIC
HOST, GIVEN THE COUNTRY'S
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND HARD
AUTHORITARIAN TURN.

27:00.585 --> 27:10.295
ONE OF THE LOUDEST VOICES
CONDEMNING CHINA IS NOT A VOICE
AT ALL, BUT RATHER A HAND.
SINCE SELF-EXILING FROM CHINA IN

27:10.362 --> 27:16.401
2009, THE ARTIST KNOWN SIMPLY AS
BADIUCAO HAS USED HIS WORK TO
TAKE ON THE COUNTRY'S LEADER,
XI JINPING, SPECIFICALLY, AND

27:16.468 --> 27:24.409
THE REGIME MORE GENERALLY.
LIKE ALL THE BEST POLITICAL
CARTOONISTS, BADIUCAO IS
ALTERNATELY ANGRY AND PLAYFUL AS

27:24.476 --> 27:31.049
HE CALLS ATTENTION TO WHAT HE
SEES AS CHINA'S BRUTALITY.
IT'S COME AT A STEEP PRICE;
BADIUCAO MAY NEVER GO HOME

27:31.116 --> 27:37.188
AGAIN.
BUT ON HE GOES, TRAVELING
THE WORLD USING PAINT AND WIT,
ONLINE AND ON WALLS, TO DRAW

27:37.255 --> 27:46.131
TRUTH TO POWER.
HAD YOU BEEN IN MIAMI BEACH THIS
FALL, YOU'D BE FORGIVEN FOR
WALKING BY THIS PLAZA AND

27:46.197 --> 27:53.972
THINKING YOU'D ENCOUNTERED
PROMOTIONAL BILLBOARDS FOR THE
BEIJING WINTER OLYMPICS.
BUT A CLOSER LOOK REVEALED A

27:54.039 --> 28:01.613
PROVOCATIVE VISUAL ARGUMENT FOR
WHY CHINA IS UNFIT TO HOST THE
GAMES.
HERE WAS A CHINESE HOCKEY PLAYER

28:01.679 --> 28:08.686
BLOODYING A TIBETAN MONK; A
CHINESE SNOWBOARDER ATOP A
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA; A FACELESS
CHINESE BI-ATHLETE POISED TO

28:08.753 --> 28:19.764
EXECUTE A MEMBER OF THE UIGHUR
MINORITY; A CURLER, REPRESENTING
CHINA'S DELAY IN WARNING THE
WORLD ABOUT COVID.

28:19.831 --> 28:25.770
THIS WAS THE HANDIWORK OF
BADIUCAO, A 35-YEAR-OLD CHINESE
EXILE NOW BASED IN AUSTRALIA.
I NOTICE, IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY,

28:25.837 --> 28:32.110
THOSE AREN'T CONVENTIONAL
OLYMPIC RINGS.
>> Badiucao: THEY ARE ACTUALLY
MADE OF BARBED WIRE.

28:32.177 --> 28:39.784
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW CHINA IS
GOING TO USE OLYMPICS-- NOT AS A
CELEBRATION FOR HUMANITY, BUT
ACTUALLY USE IT AS A PLATFORM TO

28:39.851 --> 28:48.593
PROMOTING ITS PROPAGANDA, WHICH
IS FUNDAMENTALLY CRACKING DOWN
ON PEPLE'S BASIC RIGHTS.
(<i> APPLAUSE</i> )

28:48.660 --> 28:53.832
>> Wertheim: BADIUCAO HAD COME
TO SOUTH FLORIDA TO ACCEPT THE
HUMAN RIGHTS FOUNDATION'S
VACLAV HAVEL PRIZE FOR CREATIVE

28:53.898 --> 29:00.805
DISSENT.
WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE PURPOSE
OF YOUR ART?
>> Badiucao: I SOMETIMES JUST

29:00.872 --> 29:07.078
IMAGINE I'M THIS KID WHO'S
HOLDING A BIG ROCK AND JUST
THROW THE ROCK INTO THE LAKE,
SO THAT WE SEE ALL THE SPLASH,

29:07.145 --> 29:11.382
WE EE THE CHANGE.
>> Wertheim: YOU THROW YOUR ROCK
IN THIS LAKE, SEE THE SPLASH,
SEE WHERE THE RIPPLES, RIPPLE.

29:11.449 --> 29:19.090
>> Badiucao: EXACTLY.
>> Wertheim: CHINA DOES NOT
TOLERATE RIPPLES.
INSIDE CHINA, THERE ARE STRICT

29:19.157 --> 29:26.064
LAWS FORBIDDING MOCKING AND
QUESTIONING LEADERS OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY, KNOWN AS THE
C.C.P.

29:26.131 --> 29:32.270
EVEN OUTSIDE CHINA, DISSENT DOES
NOT GO OVER WELL.
DO YOU FEEL IN DANGER?
DO YOU FEEL UNSAFE?

29:32.337 --> 29:40.044
>> Badiucao: WELL, THIS IS
ACTUALLY MY DAILY ROUTINE, THAT
I WILL RECEIVE DEATH THREAT IN
A DAILY BASIS, ONLINE, ON MY

29:40.111 --> 29:46.651
SOCIAL MEDIA-- TWITTER,
INSTAGRAM, DIRECT MESSAGE.
>> Wertheim: BADIUCAO KNOWS THAT
AS AN ARTIST POKING THE CHINESE

29:46.718 --> 29:53.525
REGIME, HE RISKS RETALIATION
BOTH AGAINST HIMSELF AND HIS
FAMILY BACK IN CHINA.
FOR YEARS, HE HID BEHIND A MASK

29:53.591 --> 30:00.165
IN PUBLIC, WORKING INCOGNITO,
GUERILLA-STYLE, BOTH IN
AUSTRALIA AND ANY TIME HE
TRAVELED.

30:00.231 --> 30:06.471
HE ADOPTED A PSEUDONYM,
BADIUCAO--
A NAME THAT PURPOSELY, HE SAYS,
HAS NO MEANING.

30:06.538 --> 30:10.808
HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW YOUR
REAL NAME?
>> Badiucao: IF YOU KNOW I'M
BADIUCAO, THEN YOU DON'T KNOW MY

30:10.875 --> 30:16.548
REAL NAME.
AND IF YOU KNOW MY REAL NAME,
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW I'M
BADIUCAO.

30:16.614 --> 30:23.755
>> Wertheim: WHEN THE CHINESE
FIGURED OUT HIS REAL IDENTITY
THREE YEARS AGO, BADIUCAO
INITIALLY WENT UNDERGROUND.

30:23.821 --> 30:32.297
BUT HE TOOK OFF HIS MASK, AND
HAS CONTINUED HURLING DARTS AT
THE REGIME.
IN THIS RECENT CARTOON, TENNIS

30:32.363 --> 30:37.335
STAR PENG SHUAI CONFRONTS THE
REALITY OF ACCUSING A FORMER
VICE PREMIER OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.
>> Badiucao: I WANT TO BE AN

30:37.402 --> 30:44.275
INSPIRING FIGURE.
I WANT MY ART TO HELPING OTHERS
TO COLLECTING COURAGE AND JOIN
ME.

30:44.342 --> 30:51.282
BUT, IF I GIVING UP THIS,
THEN WHAT DOES IT SAY TO THE
REST OF THEM?
>> Wertheim: WHAT IS THE

30:51.349 --> 30:56.754
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR
POPULARITY AND YOUR SECURITY?
>> Badiucao: I DO THINK IT HAS A
VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP.

30:56.821 --> 31:01.693
>> Wertheim: SO, ALMOST THE MORE
POPULAR YOU GET, YOU'RE BUYING
YOURSELF AN EXTRA LAYER OF
SECURITY?

31:01.759 --> 31:06.731
>> Badiucao: YEAH.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU
CAN DO IT.

31:06.798 --> 31:12.804
>> Wertheim: MAYBE SO, BUT BEING
POPULAR ALSO MEANS HIS WORK HAS
BEEN SCRUBBED BY CENSORS INSIDE
CHINA.

31:12.870 --> 31:20.411
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR WORK THAT
DRIVES THIS REGIME CRAZY?
>> Badiucao: I GUESS IT'S THIS
ATTITUDE THAT, I DON'T CARE

31:20.478 --> 31:27.352
ABOUT HOW SERIOUS YOU ARE,
HOW DANGEROUS YOU ARE.
I'M JUST GOING TO BE MYSELF.
I AM AN INDIVIDUAL.

31:27.418 --> 31:35.460
I'M NOT CONTROLLED BY ANY
AUTHORITY, CERTAINLY NOT C.C.P.
THAT SCARES THEM.
BECAUSE ALL THEY WANT IS

31:35.526 --> 31:40.598
TOTAL CONTROL.
>> Wertheim: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT BUTTONS TO
PUSH, WHAT-- WHAT LEVERS TO PULL

31:40.665 --> 31:49.974
ON, THAT'S GOING TO TWEAK THEM.
>> Badiucao: I GUESS IT'S NOT ME
FINDING THE BUTTON, IT'S THEM
OFFERING THE BUTTON TO ME.

31:50.041 --> 31:56.114
>> Wertheim: ONE EXAMPLE AMONG
MANY: AN INTERNET MEME SURFACED
COMPARING XI JINPING AND
BARACK OBAMA TO WINNIE THE POOH

31:56.180 --> 32:03.588
AND TIGGER.
NO BIG DEAL, RIGHT?
CHINA CENSORED ANY MENTION OR
IMAGE LINKING XI TO POOH.

32:03.655 --> 32:08.960
TO BADIUCAO, THIS WAS
IRRESISTIBLE.
HE CREATED A SERIES OF CARTOONS
POKING FUN AT XI'S HARDLINE

32:09.027 --> 32:13.031
STANCE AGAINST AN ANIMATED
DISNEY CHARACTER.
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT WINNIE THE
POOH?

32:13.097 --> 32:19.671
WHY WAS THAT SO EFFECTIVE?
>> Badiucao: BECAUSE WINNIE THE
POOH IS SO LOVED BY THE PUBLIC.
IT'S SO RECOGNIZED.

32:19.737 --> 32:25.576
AND WHEN IT'S COMBINED WITH
XI JINPING'S IMAGE, THEN YOU
HAVE PEOPLE ASK QUESTIONS:
"WHY DO YOU WANT TO DELETE THAT

32:25.643 --> 32:32.550
YELLOW BEAR?"
>> Wertheim: YOU RECOGNIZE THE
ABSURDITY OF THIS TOWERING
SUPERPOWER BEING SO OFFENDED BY

32:32.617 --> 32:40.692
A BENIGN YELLOW BEAR.
>> Badiucao: EXACTLY.
IF YOU ARE IN THE DEMOCRATIC
SOCIETY, I THINK POLITICIAN WILL

32:40.758 --> 32:48.032
BE THRILLED IF THEY CAN COMPARE
WITH WINNIE THE POOH INSTEAD OF
SOME EVIL CHARACTER.
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHINA.

32:48.099 --> 32:59.210
>> Wertheim: WHEN XI WAS RE-
ELECTED BY CHINA'S PARLIAMENT,
THE MARGIN WAS 2,970 VOTES TO 0.
(<i> STANDING OVATION</i> )

32:59.277 --> 33:06.384
AND WHEN XI GOT RID OF TERM
LIMITS, ALLOWING HIM TO RULE
INDEFINITELY, BADIUCAO POSTED
THIS TONGUE-IN-CHEEK CREATION

33:06.451 --> 33:13.624
ONLINE HE CALLED “XI FOREVER.”
WHEN THE COMMUNIST PARTY WENT TO
WORK ON PASSING A RESOLUTION
FAVORABLY EQUATING XI TO THE

33:13.691 --> 33:21.332
DICTATOR MAO ZEDONG, BADIUCAO,
ARMED WITH POSTERS, HOMEMADE
GLUE AND A FULL SATCHEL OF
OUTRAGE, WENT TO WORK IN

33:21.399 --> 33:27.805
MANHATTAN.
HE COMPARED XI TO A MAGICIAN
CONJURING CHAIRMAN MAO'S SPIRIT.
>> Badiucao: XI JINPING HAS

33:27.872 --> 33:33.511
TRIED TO PORTRAY HIMSELF AS
ANOTHER MAO ZEDONG, ANOTHER
RED SUN OF CHINA.
HE WANTS TO ACHIEVE WHAT MAO

33:33.578 --> 33:43.020
HAS ACHIEVED.
HE WANTS TO BE CELEBRATED AS
THIS GODLIKE FIGURE, LIKE MAO
ENJOYED IN HIS TIME.

33:43.087 --> 33:49.227
>> Wertheim: IT WAS BY ACCIDENT
THAT BADIUCAO BECAME A LEADING
CRITIC OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST
PARTY.

33:49.293 --> 33:55.900
IN 2007, HE WAS A LAW STUDENT IN
HIS HOMETOWN OF SHANGHAI,
WATCHING A FILM ONLINE, WHEN
THE MOVIE ABRUPTLY SWITCHED TO

33:55.967 --> 34:02.540
FOOTAGE SOMEONE HAD SECRETLY
EMBEDDED DEPICTING THE
1989 STUDENT PROTESTS IN
TIANANMEN SQUARE.

34:02.607 --> 34:11.182
(<i> PROTESTS</i> )
>> Badiucao: AND THAT IS
ACTUALLY THE VERY FIRST TIME I
KNOW THIS EXISTS.

34:11.249 --> 34:14.919
>> Wertheim: SO, WAIT-- SO
YOU'RE IN LAW SCHOOL?
YOU'RE IN YOUR 20s.
>> Badiucao: I AM.

34:14.986 --> 34:19.724
>> Wertheim: AND THE FIRST TIME
YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT THE
TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE-- THIS
WORLDWIDE NEWS-- AND THE FIRST

34:19.791 --> 34:26.631
TIME YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT IT IS
WHEN RANDOMLY IT'S IN A
DOCUMENTARY YOU HAPPEN TO SEE?
>> Badiucao: YEAH.

34:26.697 --> 34:31.969
THANKS TO SOME, YOU KNOW, CLEVER
DISSIDENT WHO MADE THIS HAPPEN.
>> Wertheim: YOUR PARENTS HADN'T
TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS?

34:32.036 --> 34:38.242
>> Badiucao: NEVER.
>> Wertheim: TEACHERS?
>> Badiucao: NEVER.
>> Wertheim: DISCOVERING THE

34:38.309 --> 34:43.848
TRUTH ABOUT TIANANMEN SQUARE
MADE BADIUCAO WANT TO LEAVE
CHINA.
(<i> GUNFIRE</i> )

34:43.915 --> 34:52.790
IT WASN'T JUST WHAT HAD
HAPPENED; IT WAS<i> HOW EASILY</i> THE
HISTORY WAS ERASED.
IN 2009, HE RE-SETTLED TO

34:52.857 --> 34:58.529
AUSTRALIA, GAVE UP LAW, AND
STARTED DRAWING, DESPITE NO
FORMAL TRAINING.
HE EVENTUALLY BRANCHED OUT,

34:58.596 --> 35:04.669
TRAVELING AND PERFORMING
STREET ART TO HIGHLIGHT CHINA'S
REPRESSION.
IN THESE SCENES FROM THE

35:04.735 --> 35:12.710
AUSTRALIAN DOCUMENTARY “CHINA'S
ARTFUL DISSIDENT,” BADIUCAO,
STILL MASKED, POSED IN FRONT OF
BERLIN'S BRANDENBURG GATE.

35:12.777 --> 35:20.718
HE WAS HONORING ONE OF THE
MOST TABOO SUBJECTS IN CHINA:
TANK MAN, THE NAMELESS
PRO-DEMOCRACY PROTESTER WHO

35:20.785 --> 35:27.091
STOOD IN FRONT OF THE CHINESE
MILITARY IN 1989.
>> Badiucao: TANK MAN IS THE
GHOST HAUNTING C.C.P. THE MOST.

35:27.158 --> 35:34.465
>> Wertheim: WHAT DOES TANK MAN
REPRESENT?
>> Badiucao: IT SHOWS THAT ANY
ORDINARY PEOPLE OR PERSON COULD

35:34.532 --> 35:41.472
HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND IN
FRONT OF THE MOST POWERFUL
OBJECT.
>> Wertheim: I KNOW THE IMAGE OF

35:41.539 --> 35:49.780
TANK MAN IS ALWAYS NEAR YOU.
>> Badiucao: BEFORE THE 25th
ANNIVERSARY OF TIANANMEN
MASSACRE, I JUST WANT SOMETHING

35:49.847 --> 35:57.955
ON MY RIGHT ARM, THE ARM THAT I
USE TO DRAW, AS A REMINDER THAT
THIS ORDINARY CHINESE GUY,
WHO JUST COLLECT ALL THE COURAGE

35:58.022 --> 36:06.564
IN THE WORLD AND PUSH HIMSELF IN
FRONT OF THE TANK.
HE'S FEARLESS.
>> Wertheim: WHILE IN THE U.S.,

36:06.631 --> 36:12.203
BADIUCAO CONNECTED WITH STUDENTS
WHO MARCHED FOR DEMOCRACY IN
TIANANMEN SQUARE.
THEY ARE NOW MIDDLE-AGED,

36:12.270 --> 36:20.511
EXILED, AND STILL BEAR SCARS.
FANG ZHENG LOST HIS LEGS TO A
TANK DURING THE MASSACRE.
ZHOU FENGSUO WAS AMONG THE FIRST

36:20.578 --> 36:27.685
TO ENTER TIANANMEN SQUARE, AND
ONE OF THE LAST TO LEAVE.
THE FORMER STUDENTS SEE BADIUCAO
KEEPING ALIVE THEIR IDEALS.

36:27.752 --> 36:38.663
>> Zhou Fengsuo: IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION TO CARRY
THE TORCH ON.
AND I SEE THIS HOPE IN HIM.

36:38.729 --> 36:42.700
AND HE'S SO CREATIVE.
>> Wertheim: THAT'S HOW YOU
FEEL, HE'S CARRYING THE TORCH
FOR WHAT YOUR GENERATION

36:42.767 --> 36:48.539
STARTED?
>> Zhou: YES.
DEFINITELY.
>> Wertheim: AS A PROTEST

36:48.606 --> 36:55.680
LEADER, ZHOU BECAME THE
FIFTH-MOST WANTED MAN IN CHINA.
HE SPENT A YEAR IN JAIL, THEN
FLED TO THE U.S. IN THE MID-90s.

36:55.746 --> 37:02.620
ZHOU SAYS CHINA DOESN'T KNOW HOW
TO HANDLE BADIUCAO.
>> Zhou: CHINESE INFLUENCE OVER
THE WORLD, IT'S SO PERVASIVE.

37:02.687 --> 37:08.626
AND THEY CAN CONTROL ANYTHING--
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, U.S.
COMPANIES-- BUT STILL THEY
CANNOT CHANGE BADIUCAO.

37:08.693 --> 37:20.071
THIS ONE, SINGLE PERSON WHO CAN
ALWAYS COME OUT WITH ENDLESS
ARTS CHALLENGING THE AUTHORITY.
>> Wertheim: YOU'RE SAYING THE

37:20.137 --> 37:24.342
CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CAN
PRESSURE COMPANIES AND OTHER
NATIONS, BUT THEY CAN'T...
>> Zhou: THEY CAN'T CHANGE THIS

37:24.408 --> 37:28.946
PERSON.
>> Wertheim: ...PRESSURE THIS
GUY.
>> Zhou: YEAH.

37:29.013 --> 37:32.850
THAT'S THE SPIRIT OF TANK MAN,
THE PERSON, VERSUS TOTALITARIAN
NATION.
HE'S DEFINITELY A THORN IN THEIR

37:32.917 --> 37:40.191
EYE.
>> Wertheim: BADIUCAO MAY BE A
LONE DISSIDENT TAKING ON THE
WORLD'S LARGEST GOVERNMENT, BUT

37:40.257 --> 37:47.498
HE IS CONVINCED HIS IS NO
EXERCISE IN FUTILITY.
YOU SAID YOU ADMIRE THE
MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURE, SISYPHUS.

37:47.565 --> 37:50.801
>> Badiucao: RIGHT.
>> Wertheim: WHAT'D YOU MEAN BY
THAT?
>> Badiucao: HIS MISSION SEEMS,

37:50.868 --> 38:00.478
LIKE, DOOMED.
THAT HE WILL NEVER PUSH THE ROCK
TO THE VERY TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.
IT'S A BIT LIKE ME WHEN I'M

38:00.544 --> 38:08.819
CREATING ARTWORKS TO CHALLENGE
THE CHINESE REGIME.
I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL BE
CHANGED, OR I DON'T KNOW IF MY

38:08.886 --> 38:15.493
WORK WILL CHANGE IT AT ALL.
BUT EVEN IF THAT IS A REALITY,
DOES IT MEAN MY WORK HAS NO
MEANING?

38:15.559 --> 38:22.833
I DON'T THINK SO.
>> Wertheim: IN SEPTEMBER,
BADIUCAO BROUGHT OUT HIS
PAINTBRUSH TO CONVEY HIS

38:22.900 --> 38:29.573
OUTRAGE FOR CHINA'S CRACKDOWN
ON HONG KONG.
FASHIONING HONG KONG'S LEADER,
CARRIE LAM, AS A PUPPET OF

38:29.640 --> 38:36.080
XI JINPING, BADIUCAO MELDED
THEIR FACES.
LAST MONTH, IN NORTHERN ITALY,
A CENTER OF ART, THAT COMBINED

38:36.147 --> 38:43.688
IMAGE GREETED VISITORS, AS
BADIUCAO HELD HIS FIRST MAJOR
SOLO EXHIBITION IN THE CITY OF
BRESCIA.

38:43.754 --> 38:53.064
IT ALMOST DIDN'T HAPPEN.
AT THE LAST MINUTE, CHINA TRIED
TO FLEX ITS MUSCLE.
>> Badiucao: THEY'RE ACTUALLY

38:53.130 --> 39:00.805
WRITING THREATENING LETTERS.
IT'S LIKE A BLACKMAILING, YOU
KNOW?
"IF YOU DO BADIUCAO'S SHOW,

39:00.871 --> 39:03.441
THEN MAYBE IN THE FUTURE OUR
COLLABORATION WILL BE
PROBLEMATIC."
>> Wertheim: SPECIFICALLY, THE

39:03.507 --> 39:07.678
CHINESE EMBASSY IN ROME DEMANDED
THE SHOW BE CANCELLED BECAUSE
THE EXHIBITION WAS “FULL OF
ANTI-CHINESE LIES;” WOULD“

39:07.745 --> 39:14.919
SERIOUSLY WOUND THE FEELINGS OF
THE CHINESE PEOPLE;” AND POSED“
A THREAT TO FRIENDLY RELATIONS
BETWEEN CHINA AND ITALY."

39:14.985 --> 39:25.129
THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES HELD
FIRM, AND THE SHOW WENT ON.
THERE WAS A NOD TO WHAT BADIUCAO
SEES AS XI'S WILLFULLY SLOW

39:25.196 --> 39:30.434
RESPONSE TO COVID, AND HE PAID
HOMAGE TO THE UIGHUR MINORITY
THAT CHINA HAS IMPRISONED.
TO WHAT EXTENT ARE YOU

39:30.501 --> 39:36.340
REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE THAT
CAN'T EXPRESS THEMSELVES INSIDE
CHINA?
>> Badiucao: I THINK THIS IS

39:36.407 --> 39:44.915
THE REALITY, THAT CHINESE PEOPLE
DO NOT HAVE A SENSE OF SAFETY
THAT THEY CAN SPEAK FREELY.
BUT I AM IN THIS VERY PRIVILEGED

39:44.982 --> 39:59.096
POSITION THAT I'M NOT IN CHINA,
SO I HAVE EVERY RESPONSIBILITY
TO MAKE MY VOICE TO BE HEARD, TO
BECOME THEIR VOICES.

40:02.466 --> 40:09.273
>> Wertheim: NEXT SUNDAY, ON
"60 MINUTES PRESENTS," A
ONE-HOUR EXPANDED VERSION OF
OUR STORY ON WORLD WAR II'S

40:09.340 --> 40:14.145
SECRET INTELLIGENCE UNIT,
THE RITCHIE BOYS.
IT INCLUDES INTERVIEWS AND
FOOTAGE NOT BROADCAST

40:14.211 --> 40:18.616
PREVIOUSLY.
I'M JON WERTHEIM.
WE'LL BE BACK IN TWO WEEKS
WITH AN ALL-NEW EDITION OF

40:18.682 --> 40:19.683
"60 MINUTES."
