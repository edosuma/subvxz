No! No!

00:11.612 --> 00:12.480
No, no, no, no, no!

No, no, no!!!!

Let's go, honey!

01:01.195 --> 01:02.096
Come on, you can do this.

01:02.130 --> 01:02.763
See if you can catch up.

01:04.532 --> 01:05.199
First word.

01:06.300 --> 01:06.767
Curve.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.668
Curvy.

01:07.701 --> 01:08.769
Leaning tower of Pisa!

01:09.670 --> 01:10.338
No.

01:10.371 --> 01:10.804
Second word.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.106
Sounds like...

01:12.140 --> 01:13.674
Um... cut.

01:13.707 --> 01:14.342
Chop.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.543
Karate!

01:15.576 --> 01:16.744
Kung-fu.

01:16.777 --> 01:17.845
Uh, you're a ballet dancer.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.380
You're a... bull rider!

01:19.413 --> 01:20.681
Hey, don't talk!

01:20.714 --> 01:21.682
Sofa.

01:21.715 --> 01:22.516
Bum.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.151
Chop!

01:23.184 --> 01:23.684
Time!

01:23.717 --> 01:24.418
Sorry.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.586
Time. Time.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.521
Banana split!

01:27.555 --> 01:29.623
What?! How is that banana split?

01:29.657 --> 01:32.426
Could I make it any more clear,
Lindsay?

01:32.460 --> 01:33.327
Banana split?

01:33.361 --> 01:34.695
Banana split.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.829
That was mean, Mark.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.498
We're about to show you
how it's done.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.532
Look at the pros.

01:38.566 --> 01:39.233
Ok, alright.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.168
Time.

01:40.201 --> 01:40.801
Alright, okay.

01:40.834 --> 01:41.535
Ok, you ready?

01:41.569 --> 01:42.436
Ready?

01:42.470 --> 01:44.138
Yeah, I'm with you.

01:44.172 --> 01:44.605
Let's go!

01:44.638 --> 01:45.839
Me. I. You.

01:45.873 --> 01:46.540
Me and you.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.175
I.

01:47.208 --> 01:47.575
Sam.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.409
Kyle.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.578
Oooh.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.812
Making out?

01:51.845 --> 01:52.680
Bed time.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.614
Me, you.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.848
Heart, love.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.384
Mr. Romance?

01:56.417 --> 01:57.651
Ok, sounds like... bowl.

01:57.685 --> 01:58.819
Bowl, bowl, bowl, bowl.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.454
Bowl.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.822
Your mole?

02:01.855 --> 02:02.356
Almost out of time.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.493
Goal, soul, soul mate!

02:05.526 --> 02:06.427
Yes!

02:06.460 --> 02:08.162
Yaaay!

02:08.196 --> 02:10.663
Hey, hey, hey, I think I saw
some lip reading going on here.

02:10.698 --> 02:11.465
Good job.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.167
It doesn't matter.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.802
It doesn't matter, because they
are winning like ten to one.

02:16.204 --> 02:16.604
Wait, what did you say
the score was?

02:16.637 --> 02:17.438
Ten to two.

02:17.471 --> 02:17.905
Do you want more wine?

02:17.938 --> 02:18.706
That's bad.

02:18.739 --> 02:19.540
No, it's not ten to two.

02:19.573 --> 02:19.940
When did you get two?

02:19.973 --> 02:20.808
Ok, four.

02:20.841 --> 02:21.675
You just made that up.

02:21.709 --> 02:22.443
I am just getting started.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.211
You're cheating now.

02:23.244 --> 02:23.911
Woah, woah, woah.

02:23.944 --> 02:24.945
I gotta break up the party.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.946
I have an announcement to make.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.815
So H.O.S.T. just made
it's one millionth sale.

02:28.749 --> 02:29.917
Yay!

02:29.950 --> 02:30.618
Wooo!

02:30.651 --> 02:31.485
I knew it!

02:31.519 --> 02:32.453
Boom!

02:32.486 --> 02:34.422
What'd I say? What'd I say?

02:34.455 --> 02:35.423
Just pay me. Just pay me.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.558
Yes!

02:37.591 --> 02:38.926
I'm so proud of you.

02:38.959 --> 02:39.827
I'm proud of you.

02:39.860 --> 02:40.628
Guys.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.562
To good friends...

02:41.595 --> 02:42.763
Oh, he's talking.

02:42.796 --> 02:46.200
Business partners,
my beautiful wife,

02:46.234 --> 02:47.401
and to busting our humps

02:47.435 --> 02:49.737
so we could afford
this kick-ass wine.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.706
We are living the dream,
my friend.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.548
The search has
been officially suspended

03:00.581 --> 03:02.816
for missing tech mogul
Kyle Hastings.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.918
Hastings went missing six
weeks ago while climbing

03:04.952 --> 03:07.321
the rough terrain along
the coast,

03:07.355 --> 03:10.324
engaged in an extreme sport
known as coast tearing.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.293
Kyle and his partner,
Mark Chadwick,

03:12.326 --> 03:14.228
created the premier
home operating

03:14.262 --> 03:16.497
sync tool known as H.O.S.T,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.732
which has revolutionized
smart home technology

03:18.766 --> 03:22.002
by syncing entire houses
to a single app.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.938
Although an experienced climber,
it is believed that Hastings

03:24.972 --> 03:28.008
fell and drowned in
the waters off state park.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.379
Despite an extensive search his
body has yet to be recovered.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.647
Kyle, I have pre-selected
other channels you may enjoy.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.849
H.O.S.T. off.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.385
Kyle, I did not understand your last command.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.986
Please repeat.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.289
H.O.S.T., please turn off.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.690
Kyle, I did not understand...

03:42.723 --> 03:44.558
H.O.S.T., turn off!

03:44.592 --> 03:45.526
Kyle, I did not understand...

03:45.559 --> 03:47.461
Please, turn off!

03:47.495 --> 03:49.563
Kyle, I did not understand your last request.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.765
Please turn off!

03:51.799 --> 03:53.267
Kyle, I did not understand your last command.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.002
Why won't you turn off?!

03:55.035 --> 03:57.805
Kyle, I did not understand your last command.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.474
Please repeat.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.476
Please, just turn off.

04:09.517 --> 04:10.451
It's been twelve weeks, right?

04:11.985 --> 04:12.786
Yeah.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.455
The doctor's accurate.

04:14.488 --> 04:17.958
So... tell the whole world?

04:17.991 --> 04:20.428
Are you telling me that
you haven't even told Mark?

04:20.461 --> 04:23.364
I promised you I wouldn't
until you felt comfortable.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.499
Hmm. You're adorable.

04:25.533 --> 04:26.600
Adorable?

04:26.634 --> 04:27.768
That's a thing?

04:27.801 --> 04:30.504
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you prefer cute?

04:30.538 --> 04:31.605
Alright, babe, I
gotta finish up.

04:31.639 --> 04:32.873
Oh, listen.

04:32.906 --> 04:33.907
I'm having the crib delivered
next week.

04:33.941 --> 04:37.411
Babe, let's not jump the gun.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.947
You remember what happened
last time.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.982
Maybe we can just paint
the baby's room

04:42.015 --> 04:44.051
before we start shopping?

04:44.084 --> 04:46.654
Yeah, for sure.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.888
You alright?

04:47.921 --> 04:49.723
Hold this.

04:49.757 --> 04:53.394
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

04:53.427 --> 04:54.595
I'm having a spasm.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.696
I just-I'm gonna lie down
for a sec.

04:55.729 --> 04:56.564
Yeah.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.565
Take it easy.

05:02.670 --> 05:03.504
Sam?

05:04.772 --> 05:05.806
Sam?!

05:25.158 --> 05:28.396
Sam, system error.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.599
Sam, system error.

05:31.632 --> 05:34.868
Sam, system error.

05:34.902 --> 05:38.472
Sam, system error.

05:38.506 --> 05:43.644
Sam, system error.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.413
Shut off...

05:45.446 --> 05:47.715
Sam, system error.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.049
Stop.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.651
H.O.S.T. system engaged.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.033
Intruder detected Sam.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.935
Mrs. Hastings!

06:07.968 --> 06:09.903
Intruder detected Sam.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.705
Mrs. Hastings!

06:11.739 --> 06:13.006
Intruder detected Sam.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.751
Hello?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.155
Lindsay?

07:05.593 --> 07:07.761
If you're a reporter
I'm calling the police.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.797
Hey.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.499
You left these in the door.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.066
I didn't think you still used
good old fashioned keys.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.201
Was that you?

07:14.234 --> 07:16.003
Just now?

07:16.036 --> 07:17.170
What're you talking about?

07:18.939 --> 07:22.776
No, I-I just... thought I heard
someone in the house.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.712
You've got, like, the best
security system around.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.046
No one could get in here.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.482
Unless you leave the keys
in the door.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.484
Yeah, I turned the security
off, Jackie.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.852
At least the power to it.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.754
I just couldn't deal with it.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.123
Plus, these reporters
snuck onto the property.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.925
What?

07:37.958 --> 07:39.893
Why didn't you tell me that?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.629
Because I cry to you enough
as it is.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.830
You're my sister.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.732
You can cry to me as much
as you want.

07:44.765 --> 07:45.733
Jackie, here.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.268
Oh, do you need more?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.571
Jackie, those things
make me foggy.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.073
I just feel like I need
a clear head right now.

07:53.106 --> 07:57.511
It just... It doesn't make sense
that Kyle would... fall.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.948
He was too experienced
of a climber.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.751
There has to be another
explanation for this.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.118
Well, he wasn't in the clearest
state of mind

08:05.152 --> 08:07.955
when he left.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.657
I'm sorry.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.591
I don't know why I said that.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.659
I didn't mean to...

08:11.692 --> 08:14.127
You haven't told anyone,
have you?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.629
'Cause I feel guilty enough
about it.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.130
I know you do, and I haven't
told anyone.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.766
I promise.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.000
Never tell what?

08:21.334 --> 08:23.003
What're you doing here?

08:23.036 --> 08:24.705
Moral support.

08:24.738 --> 08:25.939
Sam, the door was open.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.140
I locked it for you.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.542
Thank you.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.043
So, what're you guys
talking about?

08:30.077 --> 08:31.679
Don't worry, I
can keep a secret.

08:31.712 --> 08:32.613
Oh really?

08:32.645 --> 08:34.014
Like Sam's surprise party?

08:34.047 --> 08:36.082
Most women don't come
to an event looking like

08:36.116 --> 08:38.552
they've been binging on take-out
and Netflix.

08:38.586 --> 08:39.787
Oh, ok.

08:39.820 --> 08:40.888
I guess a wine hangover
is a better look.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.857
Oh, hey, Linds... can you not
touch that, please?

08:43.890 --> 08:45.626
It was the last one Kyle
gave me.

08:48.328 --> 08:52.566
Sam, have you thought about maybe
getting out of town for a bit?

08:52.600 --> 08:56.036
Just until this blows over
and becomes old news.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.606
I have to agree with your sister
on that one.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.609
Guys, I can't just leave.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.176
This is my home.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.912
Well, come stay
with Mark and me.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.614
That way you won't be
leaving then.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.315
Yeah, but the reporters will
still find her at your place.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.883
The only way for her
to get peace of mind is

09:09.917 --> 09:11.018
if she leaves town.

09:11.051 --> 09:11.985
No thank you.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.053
Maybe.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.023
Maybe you guys are right.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.837
These are birth control pills.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.376
Please tell me you haven't
been taking those.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.078
I-I was going to talk to you...

10:11.111 --> 10:12.345
When?

10:12.379 --> 10:13.947
A month from now?

10:13.981 --> 10:14.815
And here I've been thinking
that we've been trying

10:14.848 --> 10:16.016
this whole time.

10:16.049 --> 10:19.219
Kyle, I'm sorry.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.154
I was just afraid that
after two disappointments

10:21.188 --> 10:22.923
I was really gonna
break your heart.

10:22.956 --> 10:23.824
So you thought
this would be better?

10:23.857 --> 10:25.158
Lying to me?

10:25.192 --> 10:26.259
I mean, what did I do to you
to make you think

10:26.293 --> 10:27.427
that you couldn't
trust me with this?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.295
Nothing. Nothing.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.262
You didn't do anything.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.898
This is all on me.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.399
No, Sam.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.935
This all isn't just on you.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.136
I thought we were
in this together.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.404
Don't we both want this?

10:37.437 --> 10:38.739
Of course we do.

10:38.772 --> 10:39.372
I- I want this too,

10:39.406 --> 10:41.108
I just...

10:41.141 --> 10:42.876
You lied to me.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.322
So how's the kitchen
renovation coming?

11:29.356 --> 11:30.490
Good!

11:30.523 --> 11:32.392
Though it's stalled
for the moment

11:32.425 --> 11:35.495
because I'm waiting for these
cabinets from Sweden.

11:35.528 --> 11:39.199
So tell me, where
is this tiny house?

11:39.232 --> 11:41.769
Um, a couple hours or so away?

11:41.802 --> 11:42.903
Oh, that's it?

11:42.936 --> 11:43.971
Mmmhmm.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.038
Are you gonna go check it out?

11:45.072 --> 11:46.273
I don't know.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.208
It might feel weird
without Kyle.

11:48.241 --> 11:51.478
Well, Sam, he obviously
intended the house for you.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.113
It sounds perfect to me.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.015
It's only 300 square feet.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.785
Ok, you lived in our treehouse
for a week

11:57.818 --> 11:59.953
before mom and dad made you
come back in here.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.755
If anyone could hack it,
it would be you,

12:01.789 --> 12:03.056
and I'm sure Kyle knew that.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.224
It's just weird.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.793
Why?

12:05.826 --> 12:07.460
Well, because Kyle never
mentioned anything to me.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.864
And apparently he wants me
to design this green space.

12:10.898 --> 12:14.234
So maybe I will just go see it.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.936
Yeah.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.005
But... don't worry,

12:18.038 --> 12:20.808
I'll be back to help with mom.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.476
Sam, she hasn't lost it yet.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.279
The doctors say her dementia
is very early stage.

12:26.313 --> 12:29.149
For now she can stay
in her own home.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.517
And I'm a nurse, remember?

12:30.550 --> 12:32.953
I can handle it.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.354
I've been looking after her
since dad died.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.388
Yeah, but I wanna help.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.091
It's fine. It's fine.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.326
Samantha?

12:39.359 --> 12:41.061
Yeah, mom?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.029
I'm here.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.465
Hi, mom.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.399
Hey, baby.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.467
How're you doing?

12:47.500 --> 12:48.401
I'm fine.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.336
Yeah?

12:49.369 --> 12:50.904
Yeah.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.340
You know, I could take you
to the spa today.

12:53.373 --> 12:57.945
Get your hair done
and your nails done.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.113
You know I can see
the sadness in your face.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.054
Ok.

13:07.087 --> 13:07.855
Excuse me.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.256
Here you go, mom.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.392
And remember,

13:12.425 --> 13:14.261
make sure you take these
with your lunch, mom.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.462
I know, Jackie.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.164
Same as every day.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.168
You know, mom,
Jackie's doing an amazing job

13:21.201 --> 13:22.936
looking after you.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.306
Sure. But she's going to turn
into a lonely old woman

13:26.339 --> 13:28.175
looking after me.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.344
Well, that is why
we have online dating.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.146
You're dating again?

13:33.180 --> 13:34.381
Maybe.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.016
What kind of bread is this?

13:36.049 --> 13:36.917
Sorry, mom.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.319
I bought the wrong one.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.420
Sorry.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.123
It's alright then.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.592
Alright, I should get going.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.493
I love you.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.495
I'll come see you soon, ok?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.498
I'll see you later.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.900
Call me when you get there.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.567
I will.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.335
Bye.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.069
Drive safely.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.370
I will.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.475
Butter on one side,
just the way you like it.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.909
What are you doing? Stop.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.987
Ok.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.678
Hi.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.213
Having some trouble?

15:13.246 --> 15:15.248
Am I ever glad to see you.

15:15.282 --> 15:15.949
Nice to meet you.

15:15.983 --> 15:16.649
I'm Ben Oxley.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.051
Samantha Hastings.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.287
And yes, I am having trouble.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.654
Let's take a look.

15:21.688 --> 15:22.522
Thank you.

15:22.555 --> 15:22.956
Yeah, you're welcome.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.958
It's so strange.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.961
It-the engine just... quit.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.163
It actually kinda went
crazy on me.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.632
I've never seen it do anything
like that before.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.968
Not so strange for around here.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.236
What do you mean?

15:36.269 --> 15:38.105
Gravity Hill didn't get
it's name by accident.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.708
They say there's a magnetic
field here, a vortex.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.676
Ok, more explanation, please?

15:43.710 --> 15:45.545
The earth's magnetic field
is concentrated here,

15:45.578 --> 15:47.247
no one can explain why

15:47.280 --> 15:50.650
electronics can just
fritz out or quit.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.185
Or start up by themselves.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.587
I had a tractor mower one
time gear up on its own

15:54.621 --> 15:57.157
and plough right through
the garage door.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.491
Wow.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.993
So you just visiting?

16:00.027 --> 16:01.694
Uh, something like that.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.331
I'm just taking some time
for myself.

16:04.364 --> 16:08.001
Well, you picked the right
place for it.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.203
The most spectacular
landscape on earth.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.472
You'll see things here you
won't see anywhere else.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.675
Natural dogwoods, wildlife,
mountain goats,

16:15.708 --> 16:18.111
year round grasses
and ground cover.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.512
You can't see it anywhere else.

16:19.546 --> 16:23.183
Well, I'm a landscape architect,
so I'm all about that.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.551
Good for you.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.718
Check it out, it should be
good to go.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.154
Oh, great.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.397
Alright.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.365
Thank you.

16:53.380 --> 16:53.813
Hi.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.548
Hey there.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.716
You must be Darren.

16:56.749 --> 16:57.750
That's me.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.052
Samantha Hastings.

16:59.086 --> 16:59.819
I figured.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.620
Nice to meet you.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.654
Nice to meet you.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.555
Wow.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.290
Yeah.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.559
Mark wanted me to give you
the key and get you all set up.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.361
Oh, so you and Mark are
working together now?

17:08.395 --> 17:10.297
I'm just helping him tie up
a few loose ends.

17:10.329 --> 17:13.599
Now that your husband is...

17:13.633 --> 17:15.102
that's a tough situation,
Samantha.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.170
I'm sorry.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.238
Do you want to show me inside?

17:18.271 --> 17:19.839
Sure, let's do that.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.142
You can drop your report
over at my office, Phil.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.513
Here it is.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.082
Oh, wow.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.754
I'd give you the tour
but this is it.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.257
This is incredible.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.360
It's amazing what they managed
to cram in here.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.429
I mean, the kitchen
is all state-of-the-art,

17:42.462 --> 17:44.397
so's the plumbing.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.166
Is there wifi here?

17:46.199 --> 17:47.534
We're working on it.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.602
In the meantime we can set up
a hotspot for you.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.338
Your cell phone will work
most of the time

17:51.371 --> 17:53.773
but you might lose signal
and have to go outside.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.242
Oh, check this out.

18:01.881 --> 18:02.782
A murphy bed.

18:02.815 --> 18:03.716
Yeah.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.884
Opens up the whole space.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.319
I've always wanted one of those.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.421
Me too.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.858
So, uh, based on the proposal
that I read in Kyle's file,

18:11.891 --> 18:14.561
his idea was to create a
community of these tiny houses?

18:14.594 --> 18:15.795
Right.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.564
Well, obviously things
have changed,

18:17.597 --> 18:18.765
with Kyle no longer with us

18:18.798 --> 18:20.767
Mark and I need
to discuss the plan.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.236
Yeah, well, I'll probably
be involved.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.305
Kyle wanted me to design
the green space.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.675
Sure.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.577
I'm sure your input will be
taken into consideration.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.582
You know, I think I'm gonna
take some time

18:35.615 --> 18:37.650
and look around so why don't you
just leave me the key

18:37.684 --> 18:40.253
and I'll lock up when I leave.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.588
Of course.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.490
If you need anything
just give me a holler.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.226
Thank you.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.327
You're welcome.

19:30.837 --> 19:31.971
Hello?

19:32.004 --> 19:34.207
Samantha, it's Detective
Sanders.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.910
Did you find him?

19:37.944 --> 19:41.514
No, but we have found something
you should take a look at.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.283
Can you come to
the station today?

19:45.418 --> 19:47.287
I'll be right down.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.767
Where did you find it?

20:00.800 --> 20:01.901
It washed up on shore
about a mile

20:01.934 --> 20:03.836
from where your husband
was climbing.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.940
Was his red ball cap with it?

20:07.974 --> 20:09.676
No, just the shoe.

20:12.679 --> 20:13.946
I know what you might
be thinking

20:13.980 --> 20:16.483
but that doesn't mean anything.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.952
No, it-it means something.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.989
It lends itself to our original
findings that he fell.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.631
I understand.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.466
I need to go.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.489
Sam, system compromised.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.792
Sam, system compromised.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.596
Sam, system compromised.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.999
Sam, system compromised.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.471
Sam, system compromised.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.373
Come on... turn off.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.275
H.O.S.T. system deactivate.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.011
Stay off.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.384
Ok, do you have everything
you need?

21:24.417 --> 21:26.052
Your phone charger?

21:26.085 --> 21:27.587
You should probably take a flashlight...

21:27.620 --> 21:28.355
Yes.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.088
Extra...

21:29.121 --> 21:32.492
Mom. I have everything.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.860
Almost done.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.796
And I got you these.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.498
Just to help you sleep.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.500
Thank you.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.834
Of course.

21:43.370 --> 21:43.603
I think I'm gonna take
both of them.

21:43.636 --> 21:44.504
Yes.

21:45.438 --> 21:45.938
Yeah, he looks good.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.040
Ok.

21:49.676 --> 21:50.543
Alright.

21:53.012 --> 21:53.946
I will call you when
I get there.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.114
Yes, and I will lock up.

21:55.147 --> 21:55.915
Don't worry about anything.

21:55.948 --> 21:56.949
I love you.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.618
I love you.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.553
Please drive safely.

22:00.587 --> 22:01.754
Bye.

22:01.788 --> 22:02.789
Bye.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.357
Come in!

22:40.560 --> 22:43.963
Hi, I saw your car parked
outside, thought I'd drop in.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.998
How's it going?

22:46.032 --> 22:47.166
It's going ok.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.602
It's going, I'm
just settling in.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.037
Yeah, this is a nice place.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.705
Thank you.

22:52.739 --> 22:53.906
Would you like some tea?

22:53.940 --> 22:55.141
Uh, sure. Thanks.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.043
So uh, whaddya got there?

22:57.076 --> 22:59.546
Yeah, this is something
I thought you might like.

22:59.579 --> 23:02.815
This is creeping thyme,
I also have dogwood,

23:02.849 --> 23:05.752
sage grasses, burberry,
you can water them,

23:05.785 --> 23:07.520
watch them bloom.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.823
Aw, that's so sweet of you.
Thank you.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.525
Uh, yeah.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.862
Just uh, kind of a little
housewarming kinda thing.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.197
I heard about your husband.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.066
I'm so sorry for your loss.

23:22.469 --> 23:23.603
Thank you.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.018
No!

23:39.051 --> 23:40.186
No, no, no, no, no.

24:07.547 --> 24:08.915
Sorry, little guy.

24:10.783 --> 24:11.884
I have tried everything,
Lindsay.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.053
Except for taking the whole
thing apart.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.522
Aw, Sam.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.857
I told you you were losing
too much weight.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.092
Maybe Mark knows someone
who can get it out.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.528
That would be great.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.730
And hey, don't use the disposal

24:23.763 --> 24:25.231
until you can get
someone in there.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.766
And who knows?

24:26.799 --> 24:27.967
Maybe I'll show up
with my tool belt.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.802
I can do amazing things
with a bottle opener.

24:32.004 --> 24:32.772
Thanks, Linds.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.073
I'll keep you posted.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.643
And please let me know
if Mark finds someone?

24:36.676 --> 24:38.044
Ok, bye.

24:38.077 --> 24:38.978
Bye.

24:58.998 --> 25:03.235
Mrs. Hastings, was your husband
known to climb solo?

25:03.269 --> 25:04.537
Yes.

25:04.571 --> 25:07.139
Yeah, he did it all the time.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.610
Said it helped clear his head.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.779
Clear his head?

25:12.812 --> 25:13.646
Ok.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.181
Was there any reason

25:15.214 --> 25:17.149
why he would have had to clear
his head that day?

25:20.319 --> 25:22.188
No.

25:22.221 --> 25:25.324
So there were no arguments
or disagreements.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.959
No.

25:26.993 --> 25:29.562
He was fine.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.964
And where were you?

25:31.998 --> 25:33.900
When he was out climbing?

25:33.933 --> 25:36.569
Here.

25:36.603 --> 25:39.271
Alone?

25:39.305 --> 25:40.740
Yeah.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.997
You're lucky.

26:38.030 --> 26:41.968
Those little spiders are nasty.

26:42.001 --> 26:45.071
One bite can leave a scar.

26:45.104 --> 26:50.176
And if you're not careful,
it'll fester and eat the flesh.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.217
You can send that
to Darren Zucker.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.019
So what you're saying is
we have lot of potential

27:00.052 --> 27:02.221
for 37 units on
the first parcel?

27:02.254 --> 27:03.956
Somewhere over 100 in all?

27:03.990 --> 27:05.357
Not bad.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.293
Yeah, can you leave the figures
on my desk?

27:07.326 --> 27:08.260
Sure, thanks.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.796
Talk later.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.099
Samantha, I am so sorry.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.200
But if I had known you were
coming to stay

27:14.233 --> 27:16.302
I would have ordered a full
inspection of the house.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.337
It's ok, it's getting done.

27:18.370 --> 27:21.373
So how long do you plan
on staying?

27:21.407 --> 27:23.710
Um, I don't know.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.311
I want to get a feel
for the area.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.747
Start putting together some
ideas of how the land

27:27.780 --> 27:30.016
could best be developed
without infringing too much

27:30.049 --> 27:31.984
on the green space.

27:32.018 --> 27:33.052
Well, the area's becoming
quite popular

27:33.085 --> 27:34.220
as a summer destination.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.688
It could prove quite lucrative.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.156
I'm sure.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.958
But if we destroy the reason
why people are coming

27:38.991 --> 27:42.128
then we have nothing. Do we?

27:42.161 --> 27:44.096
True.

28:57.870 --> 28:58.971
Hi, it's Darren, please
leave a message after the beep.

28:59.005 --> 29:02.408
Darren, it's Samantha.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.276
Um, your fumigator left
the door open.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.245
I just thought you should know.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.391
Do you recognize that song?

29:19.425 --> 29:21.193
Of course I do.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.129
It was the first dance
at our wedding.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.096
Mmmhmm.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.998
I put on a playlist for you.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.534
Seriously? A playlist?

29:28.567 --> 29:30.069
Are we in high school?

29:30.102 --> 29:31.503
Oh come on now,

29:31.537 --> 29:32.171
I think I'm better now than
I was in high school.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.439
Mmm.

29:33.472 --> 29:37.076
Mmmhmm.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.177
Oh, you are.

29:38.210 --> 29:38.978
You saved all your moves for me.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.212
Mmmhmm.

29:42.915 --> 29:45.885
I like that so far...

29:45.918 --> 29:47.386
What's wrong?

29:47.419 --> 29:50.456
I just thought I saw someone
at the window.

29:50.489 --> 29:53.392
It's probably Cruikshank
looking for his dog again.

29:53.425 --> 29:55.261
That dog is a serious
escape artist.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.562
Come here.

29:59.065 --> 30:00.132
What is it?

30:02.301 --> 30:04.036
I mean, it's gonna sound weird,
but, you know,

30:04.070 --> 30:06.538
I just feel like someone's
been watching me lately.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.340
What do you mean?

30:08.374 --> 30:10.009
I don't know, like right now.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.310
I mean, you know when someone's
watching you,

30:11.343 --> 30:14.213
you can, like, feel it?

30:14.246 --> 30:15.514
We were just doing our own thing

30:15.547 --> 30:18.084
and all of a sudden I just feel
like someone's looking at us.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.121
I see nothing.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.555
I don't think anyone's
over there, babe.

30:29.996 --> 30:32.164
Thanks again for doing this,
Ben.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.366
It's so nice of you.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.302
Happy to do it.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.169
Thanks.

30:37.203 --> 30:37.536
Just leave that there.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.005
Great.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.406
I should have mentioned it, Sam.

30:40.439 --> 30:43.242
I did some work
for your husband.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.476
Mainly environmental studies

30:44.510 --> 30:46.612
assessing the impact
of building small,

30:46.645 --> 30:48.580
keeping the footprint
of these homes compact.

30:50.917 --> 30:54.353
Recycling rainwater,
solar, you get the idea.

30:54.386 --> 30:55.621
Kyle wanted the natural
landscape

30:55.654 --> 30:58.424
to be the main attraction.

30:58.457 --> 31:01.027
He was so jazzed when
this house came together.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.195
It was meant to be a surprise
gift for you.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.467
You ok?

31:11.203 --> 31:14.006
Yeah, it's just still hard
for me to accept that, um...

31:14.040 --> 31:15.407
he's not here.

31:20.412 --> 31:24.050
You know, sometimes I feel like...

31:24.083 --> 31:27.586
like he's still with me and none
of this is real, but...

31:33.259 --> 31:35.027
Thanks for sharing that with me.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.311
Hey, Darren.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.980
Did you get my message?

31:54.013 --> 31:56.215
That's why I'm calling.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.951
It couldn't have been my guys
that left the house unlocked.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.086
Are you sure?

32:00.119 --> 32:01.587
'Cause it was clearly left open.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.389
I double checked myself,
Samantha.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.590
The door was locked.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.292
I tried both the front
door and the back door.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.094
Hello?

32:08.127 --> 32:09.461
Darren?

32:09.495 --> 32:10.296
Darren, you're cutting out.

32:10.329 --> 32:11.297
I can't hear you.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.190
No, no, no, no, no.

32:38.224 --> 32:39.191
No, where are you?

32:40.626 --> 32:41.527
Right here.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.496
Hey, I'm sorry.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.565
We thought we'd surprise you.

32:46.598 --> 32:47.599
No, it's my text messages.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.268
They're gone.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.170
They-they were right here
and now I can't find them.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.438
Well, can you... can you help her?

32:57.476 --> 32:58.410
Please, Mark.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.779
I had Kyle's last texts saved.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.515
Looks like they've been
permanently deleted.

33:03.549 --> 33:04.750
I can't pull them up.

33:04.783 --> 33:07.753
How could that happen?

33:07.786 --> 33:10.222
You may have unknowingly
pushed something

33:10.256 --> 33:11.723
while it was in your pocket.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.559
I don't...

33:13.592 --> 33:15.161
I was trying to get
the flashlight on the other day

33:15.194 --> 33:17.096
so I was pressing
all the buttons.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.266
That could have done it.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.034
Oh, I'm so sorry, Sam.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.137
It's just when I read
his message

33:25.171 --> 33:27.739
I could still hear his voice
in my head.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.775
Now I don't have anything.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.015
So what's your plan?

33:39.585 --> 33:41.187
I don't know.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.655
I think I'm just gonna
tough it out for now.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.091
It just doesn't feel right
being back home

33:45.124 --> 33:47.459
in all that empty space.

33:47.493 --> 33:50.196
There's gonna be construction
up here pretty soon.

33:50.229 --> 33:54.300
You mean a community of tiny
houses with green space, right?

33:54.333 --> 33:56.202
That's the idea?

33:59.171 --> 34:00.672
It's strange though,

34:00.706 --> 34:04.810
because Kyle wasn't very good
at keeping secrets from me

34:04.843 --> 34:07.246
and he did all this work

34:07.279 --> 34:12.484
and put time into it
and I didn't pick up on it.

34:12.518 --> 34:15.420
Apparently it was meant
to be a surprise.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.723
I think he was just waiting 'til
we were a little further along

34:17.755 --> 34:20.592
until he brought you up here.

34:20.626 --> 34:23.529
Good news, I found
the bottle opener.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.598
It was inside the cheese grater.

34:26.632 --> 34:29.067
I'm gonna go take a look around.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.206
Sam?

34:37.143 --> 34:38.677
Yeah, why not.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.379
Thank you.

34:42.781 --> 34:46.318
Here's to exhilarating views.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.420
Cheers.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.290
So how are you doing, Sam?

34:51.322 --> 34:52.591
For real.

34:54.260 --> 34:58.197
Well, I tossed my anxiety pills.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.565
That's something.

35:01.233 --> 35:02.168
I'm trying.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.735
Yeah.

35:03.769 --> 35:07.339
Sometimes I'm alright and then
this soul-crushing emptiness

35:07.373 --> 35:10.209
just comes over me.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.211
And now my ring's gone.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.779
So is Kyle's text.

35:20.819 --> 35:23.389
This place is so cute.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.323
I love the layout.

35:24.356 --> 35:25.557
Thank you.

35:25.591 --> 35:26.892
Yeah, I feel pretty
comfortable here.

35:26.925 --> 35:27.759
It's cozy.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.195
That's good.

35:29.228 --> 35:31.863
I am so sorry I can't offer you
a room

35:31.897 --> 35:34.800
but my place is a bit small.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.235
It's alright.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.737
Mark rented us a room at
the Gravity Hills Motel.

35:38.770 --> 35:39.671
Woo!

35:39.705 --> 35:41.407
It was the best they had.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.542
I'm sure it was, honey.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.277
And thank you.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.845
I just hope they still have
room service.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.514
Well, just in case they don't,

35:48.547 --> 35:50.482
make sure you have enough
change for the vending machine.

35:50.516 --> 35:51.483
Seriously?

35:51.517 --> 35:52.484
Yeah.

35:52.518 --> 35:53.485
You like chips.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.521
I love chips.

35:55.554 --> 35:56.555
Goodnight, Sam.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.725
Goodnight.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.927
She'll be asleep
before we get there.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.795
Hey, Mark?

36:03.829 --> 36:06.465
Listen, I know you have a lot
on your plate right now,

36:06.498 --> 36:07.933
running H.O.S.T. on your own,

36:07.966 --> 36:10.336
so I'd be happy to do
what I can with this place.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.703
Proposals, drawings...

36:11.737 --> 36:12.871
It's ok, I'll make time.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.440
It was important to Kyle.

36:14.473 --> 36:15.507
I'd love your input.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.275
Great.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.309
Talk to you soon.

36:17.343 --> 36:18.510
Alright, goodnight.

36:19.845 --> 36:20.679
Drive safe.

36:20.712 --> 36:21.813
Thank you.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.937
I guess I got lucky you decided
to come visit.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.006
Well, I'm not gonna leave
my little sister alone

37:21.039 --> 37:23.709
on her birthday, am I?

37:23.742 --> 37:24.510
Oh, wow.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.445
I actually forgot.

37:26.478 --> 37:27.346
Sam.

37:27.379 --> 37:28.614
Happy birthday to me.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.851
I'm having second thoughts about
staying here, Jackie.

37:32.884 --> 37:33.719
Really?

37:33.752 --> 37:34.820
Yeah.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.388
Because I have to agree
with Kyle,

37:36.422 --> 37:38.790
I think this place is amazing.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.492
Though I'm sure he didn't
mean for you

37:40.526 --> 37:41.960
to get your hand mauled.

37:41.993 --> 37:44.430
I just thought I could find
my ring.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.598
I double checked the garbage
disposal was off

37:46.632 --> 37:47.866
but I don't know,

37:47.899 --> 37:50.302
it must be this whole magnetic
vortex thing.

37:50.336 --> 37:56.308
Ok, so if you keep this on
for a couple of days

37:56.342 --> 37:59.745
it should heal without you
needing stitches.

37:59.778 --> 38:00.712
There we go.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.013
Thank you.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.582
You're welcome.

38:06.352 --> 38:08.320
Now... Let me treat the
birthday girl to lunch.

38:10.389 --> 38:13.559
Mmm. Why is it that all
the small town restaurants

38:13.592 --> 38:16.795
have the best cakes and pies?

38:16.828 --> 38:18.330
How's mom doing?

38:18.364 --> 38:19.731
She's ok.

38:19.765 --> 38:23.034
I mean, we both know
where this is gonna lead.

38:23.068 --> 38:25.704
Eventually she's gonna
have to be in a home.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.806
Yeah, I know.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.942
It's just hard.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.711
I have something for you.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.614
Ta-dah!

38:35.647 --> 38:36.348
Wow.

38:36.382 --> 38:37.883
Happy birthday.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.951
It's horribly practical but
I thought since you're kind of

38:39.985 --> 38:41.453
getting back to work...

38:45.524 --> 38:47.058
It's a magnetic board,
for your kitchen.

38:47.092 --> 38:48.394
Do you like it?

38:48.427 --> 38:49.094
I love it.

38:49.127 --> 38:49.995
Thank you.

38:50.028 --> 38:50.929
Here.

38:50.962 --> 38:52.030
Mom signed the card, too.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.402
So tell me.

38:58.637 --> 39:01.407
What are your plans
for the tiny house?

39:01.440 --> 39:04.676
Um... I'm gonna design a green space.

39:04.710 --> 39:05.544
Mmm.

39:05.577 --> 39:06.812
Yeah, like Kyle wanted.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.046
And Mark's on board, too.

39:08.079 --> 39:08.780
Really?

39:08.814 --> 39:09.881
Mmmhmm.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.417
That doesn't surprise me.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.452
What do you mean?

39:13.485 --> 39:15.421
He has the hots for you, Sam.

39:15.454 --> 39:16.922
Well, that's ridiculous.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.390
He's a good friend.

39:18.424 --> 39:21.026
Who's always wished
he was in Kyle's shoes.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.594
Oh, come on.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.430
You have to admit he dotes
on you quite a bit.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.798
I mean, look at how much he's
checked in on you since Kyle.

39:26.832 --> 39:28.934
He's just trying to be
supportive, Jackie.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.837
And may I remind you he's
married to my best friend?

39:31.870 --> 39:32.971
Fine.

39:33.004 --> 39:34.072
If that's what you wanna
think, fine.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.707
But I'm telling you,
with Kyle gone

39:35.741 --> 39:38.376
it's only a matter of time
before he makes his move.

39:41.012 --> 39:42.814
Kyle?

39:42.848 --> 39:44.082
Sam?

39:44.115 --> 39:44.883
Sam!

39:44.916 --> 39:46.452
Kyle!

39:46.485 --> 39:47.018
We'll be right back.

39:47.052 --> 39:47.786
Sam!

39:47.819 --> 39:50.656
Kyle!

39:51.623 --> 39:52.458
Kyle!

39:54.125 --> 39:54.960
Kyle!

39:56.462 --> 39:57.062
Kyle!

39:59.097 --> 40:02.968
I'm sorry, I thought you were
someone I knew.

40:07.473 --> 40:10.008
Sam, you know Kyle's gone,
right?

40:10.041 --> 40:11.109
No, it's just...

40:11.142 --> 40:12.578
What?

40:12.611 --> 40:14.880
No, the other stuff
that has been happening.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.749
It's like when Kyle felt like
someone was watching him.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.117
At-at the time I didn't
think anything of it

40:19.150 --> 40:22.621
but now I'm starting to feel it,
too.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.823
Have you stopped taking
your pills?

40:24.856 --> 40:27.192
That has nothing to do
with it, Jackie.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.661
I know what I'm feeling
and it's not paranoia

40:29.695 --> 40:31.630
or whatever it is that
you're thinking, ok?

40:31.663 --> 40:33.231
Something's not right.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.868
Kyle knew it wasn't right then
and it's not right now.

40:39.705 --> 40:41.807
Come on. Let's get you inside.

40:41.840 --> 40:42.874
It's freezing.

41:22.013 --> 41:23.682
Is this your glove?

41:23.715 --> 41:26.985
Uh... no.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.687
Huh.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.122
It's like someone's been...
messing around back here.

41:31.156 --> 41:32.758
Maybe it belongs to the air
conditioning tech that was here

41:32.791 --> 41:34.125
the other day.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.561
Yeah, but why would he be
back here if the unit's

41:35.594 --> 41:37.829
around the side of the house?

41:37.863 --> 41:39.097
Maybe he had to check
something out.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.836
You ok?

41:44.870 --> 41:47.072
Yeah, I just want you to be
safe, you know?

41:47.105 --> 41:48.874
You made us safe.

41:48.907 --> 41:51.877
But we can always get a dog.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.845
I heard puppies are good
practice for babies.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.153
Give me a signal, come on.

42:02.187 --> 42:03.822
Come on, give me a signal.

42:07.693 --> 42:08.927
Ah!

42:10.328 --> 42:11.362
Detective Sanders here,

42:11.396 --> 42:13.198
please leave a message
after the beep.

42:13.231 --> 42:15.734
Detective, hi,
it's Samantha Hastings.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.769
Listen, I need to talk to you
about a few things about Kyle.

42:17.803 --> 42:20.872
Can you please call me
as soon as you get this?

42:20.906 --> 42:22.307
Thank you.

42:34.886 --> 42:35.787
Hey, Linds.

42:35.821 --> 42:38.757
Hey, is Mark up there with you?

42:38.790 --> 42:40.325
No, why?

42:40.358 --> 42:43.194
I've sent him three texts
and he hasn't gotten back to me.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.896
And I'm worried, Sam.

42:44.930 --> 42:45.897
Oh, I'm sorry, Linds.

42:45.931 --> 42:47.733
I haven't seen him.

42:47.766 --> 42:48.900
I'm sure he's just busy.

42:48.934 --> 42:50.769
I guess.

42:50.802 --> 42:53.238
It just isn't like him to
disappear like this though.

42:53.271 --> 42:54.305
Let me know if you hear
from him?

43:19.765 --> 43:20.932
Let's see what we got here.

43:30.909 --> 43:32.343
Better than darts, huh?

43:32.377 --> 43:34.079
That's insane.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.947
Gravity Hills, Sam.

43:35.981 --> 43:37.949
It's the magnet in
that message board.

43:37.983 --> 43:39.985
Sounds like ooga-booga, I know.

43:40.018 --> 43:41.386
You should get rid of it.

43:41.419 --> 43:43.288
I'm surprised your builder
didn't tell you about it.

43:43.321 --> 43:47.092
Uh, my husband
hired the builder.

43:47.125 --> 43:48.226
Right.

43:48.259 --> 43:49.260
Sorry, didn't mean it like that.

43:49.294 --> 43:50.395
It's fine.

43:50.428 --> 43:52.230
These yours?

43:52.263 --> 43:53.932
Yeah.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.366
They're very good.

43:57.435 --> 43:58.804
I see you're trying to enhance
and preserve

43:58.837 --> 44:00.405
the plateau here.

44:00.438 --> 44:03.041
My husband's business partner
is ok with me doing this

44:03.074 --> 44:06.745
but I have to pitch it
to this new guy, Darren Zucker.

44:06.778 --> 44:08.279
Seriously?

44:08.313 --> 44:09.915
Yeah, why?

44:09.948 --> 44:11.382
Zucker's on the county board.

44:11.416 --> 44:13.685
He was behind that project
over at Stony Creek.

44:13.719 --> 44:16.221
Monster homes and block stores.

44:16.254 --> 44:19.791
Well, maybe he's
changed his mind.

44:19.825 --> 44:21.760
Wow. This is something,
Samantha.

44:21.793 --> 44:23.294
These are beautiful, really.

44:23.328 --> 44:24.662
Thank you.

44:26.197 --> 44:27.833
I don't know if Mark told you

44:27.866 --> 44:30.802
but this whole tiny house
project is on hold right now.

44:30.836 --> 44:31.803
Oh.

44:31.837 --> 44:32.537
Too many issues.

44:32.570 --> 44:34.372
Property rights, land titles...

44:34.405 --> 44:37.809
we need to get it all sorted out
before we get the go-ahead.

44:37.843 --> 44:40.278
Mind if I hang on to these
for a bit?

44:40.311 --> 44:40.979
No.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.413
No, not at all.

44:42.447 --> 44:44.215
I really appreciate your input
on this project,

44:44.249 --> 44:47.085
it means a lot to Mark and
I'd like to see this work out.

44:48.954 --> 44:51.322
Ok. Thank you, I-
I appreciate that.

44:51.356 --> 44:53.191
Can I walk you to your car?

44:53.224 --> 44:55.060
It's ok, I can walk myself out.

44:55.093 --> 44:56.294
Alright.

46:04.362 --> 46:05.964
Where are the photographs?

46:52.610 --> 46:54.812
They were right there.

47:01.486 --> 47:02.487
Hey babe?

47:02.520 --> 47:04.389
Yeah?

47:04.422 --> 47:06.491
Did you move things
around over here?

47:06.524 --> 47:08.526
No, why?

47:08.559 --> 47:11.096
You didn't move the wind chimes?

47:11.129 --> 47:13.198
No.

47:13.231 --> 47:15.967
Well, how could they be gone?

47:16.001 --> 47:19.871
I... I-you know, I had the
windows cleaned the other day.

47:19.905 --> 47:22.540
They probably moved them
and forgot to put them back.

47:22.573 --> 47:24.342
I'll call and I'll ask.

47:27.078 --> 47:30.315
I don't understand how stuff
keeps disappearing around here.

47:30.348 --> 47:31.917
I swear someone's coming
in our house.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.260
You've reached the Gravity Hill

47:42.293 --> 47:43.528
police department.

47:43.561 --> 47:45.130
If you know the extension
you're trying to reach...

47:50.035 --> 47:51.436
Sam.

47:51.469 --> 47:52.670
What's going on?

47:52.703 --> 47:53.905
Are you ok?

47:53.939 --> 47:54.605
Yeah, I'm fine.

47:54.639 --> 47:56.141
I'm just a little rattled.

47:56.174 --> 47:57.442
Uh, you need to call Lindsey.

47:57.475 --> 47:58.676
She's worried about you.

47:58.709 --> 47:59.444
We need to talk.

47:59.477 --> 48:00.545
It's important...

48:00.578 --> 48:01.379
Yeah, I already
know all about it.

48:01.412 --> 48:01.913
Darren told me the project's
on hold.

48:01.947 --> 48:03.014
Where are you going?

48:03.048 --> 48:04.182
To the police.

48:04.215 --> 48:05.050
Wait, what happened?

48:05.083 --> 48:05.917
Here, I'll go with you.

48:05.951 --> 48:07.185
No.

48:07.218 --> 48:09.254
Mark, please just go home
to Lindsey.

48:09.287 --> 48:10.421
I'll call you guys later.

48:21.632 --> 48:22.667
Mrs. Hastings.

48:22.700 --> 48:23.969
Hi.

48:24.002 --> 48:25.603
Didn't you get my message?

48:25.636 --> 48:27.205
Uh, yes.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.540
I'm sorry, I was uh...
off on a personal matter.

48:29.574 --> 48:31.943
So what can I do for you?

48:34.179 --> 48:38.316
I don't think my husband's
disappearance was an accident.

48:38.349 --> 48:42.087
For weeks before he went missing

48:42.120 --> 48:44.255
Kyle was sure he was
being stalked.

48:44.289 --> 48:47.959
Things were missing from our
home that were not explainable

48:47.993 --> 48:53.031
and at the time I just thought
he was being paranoid.

48:53.064 --> 48:55.500
But now the same thing
is happening to me.

48:55.533 --> 48:57.302
What do you mean,
the same thing?

48:57.335 --> 49:01.006
I've been staying in
the country recently.

49:01.039 --> 49:04.042
Someone's watching me
on the property.

49:04.075 --> 49:05.743
Things are going missing, too.

49:05.776 --> 49:08.179
Exactly what happened with Kyle.

49:08.213 --> 49:10.648
So, the same stalker?

49:10.681 --> 49:13.218
I have no idea.

49:13.251 --> 49:15.686
So what is it that you want
from me?

49:15.720 --> 49:17.555
Police protection?

49:19.657 --> 49:21.559
I don't know.

49:21.592 --> 49:26.097
Well, it's not under
my jurisdiction, anyway.

49:26.131 --> 49:28.299
Listen, Mrs. Hastings,

49:28.333 --> 49:30.601
this is a very difficult time
for you.

49:30.635 --> 49:33.404
I can tell.

49:33.438 --> 49:36.141
Do you have any help?

49:36.174 --> 49:39.177
Like people you can turn to?

49:39.210 --> 49:40.578
A support system?

49:45.050 --> 49:46.284
Yeah.

49:47.752 --> 49:49.020
My sister.

49:50.688 --> 49:52.290
She's a nurse.

49:55.693 --> 49:57.428
Thank you for your time.

50:15.646 --> 50:17.715
Sam?

50:17.748 --> 50:20.451
Are you alright?

50:20.485 --> 50:22.320
I wanted to talk
about your drawings.

50:33.298 --> 50:34.332
Sam?

50:36.367 --> 50:37.502
You ok?

50:52.450 --> 50:53.518
What're you doing here?

50:58.689 --> 51:00.691
What're you doing here?!

51:02.293 --> 51:03.461
That's it, I'm calling
the police right now.

51:14.672 --> 51:15.240
Hey.

51:15.273 --> 51:16.307
Hey.

51:18.443 --> 51:18.876
Here.

51:18.909 --> 51:19.844
Thanks.

51:22.513 --> 51:24.815
So that detective came
to see me last night.

51:24.849 --> 51:26.317
Oh, sorry.

51:26.351 --> 51:27.618
I should have told you
that he might follow up

51:27.652 --> 51:28.819
with some questions.

51:28.853 --> 51:31.156
No, he was more concerned
about you, Sam.

51:31.189 --> 51:33.458
And so am I.

51:33.491 --> 51:34.825
I mean,

51:34.859 --> 51:37.362
these conspiracy theories
you're coming up with...

51:37.395 --> 51:38.496
They're not theories, Jackie.

51:38.529 --> 51:39.830
Then what are they?

51:39.864 --> 51:41.566
Because we all know
what happened to Kyle

51:41.599 --> 51:45.903
and I'm not saying you have
to be ok with it, Sam.

51:45.936 --> 51:49.340
But you have to accept the fact
that you may never find him.

51:49.374 --> 51:50.641
You can't spend the rest
of your life

51:50.675 --> 51:54.179
wondering what happened to him.

51:54.212 --> 51:57.748
She's right, Sam.

51:57.782 --> 52:01.786
I am so sick of everyone
thinking that I'm crazy.

52:01.819 --> 52:02.887
And I'm sick of
everyone thinking

52:02.920 --> 52:04.689
that they know
what's best for me.

52:14.932 --> 52:16.334
Thank you.

52:16.367 --> 52:17.735
Thank you.

52:20.705 --> 52:21.839
So how was the drive up?

52:21.872 --> 52:23.541
Mmm, traffic was light.

52:23.574 --> 52:24.642
But how are you?

52:24.675 --> 52:26.611
What're you gonna do?

52:26.644 --> 52:28.246
I don't know.

52:28.279 --> 52:29.747
All my stuff is here.

52:29.780 --> 52:33.284
And, honestly, I'm not ready
to go back home yet.

52:33.318 --> 52:35.286
So I might just stay
with Jackie.

52:35.320 --> 52:35.953
What?

52:35.986 --> 52:37.755
No! Come stay with us.

52:37.788 --> 52:40.958
We can have a pajama party,
just like the old days.

52:40.991 --> 52:42.493
I don't know, Linds.

52:42.527 --> 52:44.462
Mark and I are really worried
about you.

52:44.495 --> 52:46.197
It's so isolated up here.

52:46.231 --> 52:48.366
You need to be with friends.

52:48.399 --> 52:50.535
I know.

52:50.568 --> 52:54.539
Um... how are you and Mark?

52:54.572 --> 52:58.809
Well, the truth is I think
he really misses Kyle.

52:58.843 --> 53:00.978
He hardly ever goes
to the office anymore.

53:01.011 --> 53:03.948
He used to open up to me but now it...

53:03.981 --> 53:04.715
wow.

53:04.749 --> 53:06.317
Look at me.

53:06.351 --> 53:08.486
You really don't need to hear
about my problems.

53:08.519 --> 53:08.986
No, no, no.

53:09.019 --> 53:10.888
I asked you.

53:10.921 --> 53:13.424
I want to know.

53:13.458 --> 53:15.626
This really sucks,
what you're going through,

53:15.660 --> 53:18.729
but please don't try
and do it all on your own.

53:18.763 --> 53:20.631
Ok?

53:20.665 --> 53:21.999
Mmmhmm.

53:22.032 --> 53:22.700
Is it good?

53:22.733 --> 53:23.468
It's good.

53:23.501 --> 53:24.835
How's yours?

53:24.869 --> 53:25.736
I need hot sauce.

53:25.770 --> 53:26.937
Mmm, yeah.

53:26.971 --> 53:27.805
Good idea.

53:27.838 --> 53:29.374
And sour cream.

53:29.407 --> 53:30.608
Where is he?

54:03.040 --> 54:04.842
Sam, is everything ok?

54:04.875 --> 54:06.477
Yeah, I'm fine.

54:06.511 --> 54:08.346
I just have a quick question.

54:08.379 --> 54:10.014
What do you know
about Ben Oxley?

54:12.016 --> 54:15.920
Ben's a very competent
environmental advisor,

54:15.953 --> 54:19.056
until we found out he went
off the deep end.

54:19.089 --> 54:21.326
What do you mean?

54:21.359 --> 54:23.628
Well, apparently he was
organizing protests

54:23.661 --> 54:25.596
that became violent.

54:25.630 --> 54:29.500
Kyle wouldn't fire him
so I had to.

54:29.534 --> 54:30.668
Why do you ask?

54:30.701 --> 54:32.337
I'm just curious.

54:32.370 --> 54:36.073
I met him up here and he seems
like a really great guy.

54:36.106 --> 54:40.445
Sam, do me a favour
and stay away from Ben.

54:40.478 --> 54:44.682
He's an unstable activist
with extreme views.

54:44.715 --> 54:47.017
An activist with extreme views.

54:47.051 --> 54:51.489
You mean he cares
about the environment.

54:51.522 --> 54:54.625
Why is that such a problem,
Mark?

54:54.659 --> 54:56.361
Just trust me.

57:13.063 --> 57:14.164
Hey.

57:14.198 --> 57:14.899
Hi, Ben.

57:14.932 --> 57:15.966
Sam, are you ok?

57:16.000 --> 57:17.034
You look like a gH.O.S.T..

57:19.269 --> 57:20.571
I just can't believe it.

57:20.605 --> 57:23.941
I literally just saw him
the other day.

57:23.974 --> 57:25.943
I was in his office.

57:25.976 --> 57:27.512
Yeah, I was never a big fan,

57:27.545 --> 57:31.148
but you hate to see
something like this.

57:31.181 --> 57:34.051
You can go, Mrs. Hastings.

57:34.084 --> 57:36.554
I appreciate you phoning it in
like this.

57:36.587 --> 57:38.789
Any idea how something like this
would have happened?

57:38.823 --> 57:41.692
We won't know for sure
until after the autopsy.

57:41.726 --> 57:43.661
It appears to be an accident
but it seems Mr. Zucker

57:43.694 --> 57:47.532
lost control of his vehicle
going around that hairpin.

57:47.565 --> 57:48.733
Thank you.

57:48.766 --> 57:50.568
Excuse me.

57:52.970 --> 57:55.039
Hey, Ben, I know this isn't
a good time

57:55.072 --> 57:57.642
but I just need to know.

57:57.675 --> 57:59.677
What happened with you and Mark?

57:59.710 --> 58:03.514
Well, actually, Mark and I got
along fine at first.

58:03.548 --> 58:04.615
But he changed when he started
spending time

58:04.649 --> 58:06.984
with Darren Zucker.

58:07.017 --> 58:09.119
I was running point in
the committee to oppose

58:09.153 --> 58:12.590
Zucker's development down
in Stony Creek.

58:12.623 --> 58:16.661
One of the protests
got a little out of hand.

58:16.694 --> 58:21.031
Zucker had it in for me
ever since.

58:21.065 --> 58:23.067
Of course, none of that
really matters anymore.

58:28.272 --> 58:29.807
Let's go.

58:36.714 --> 58:38.616
I am so sorry, Sam.

58:38.649 --> 58:39.884
What a day.

58:42.286 --> 58:44.922
Did you know the man who died?

58:44.955 --> 58:46.190
A little bit.

58:48.593 --> 58:50.327
I only met him a couple
of times.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.763
He was in business
with Kyle and Mark.

58:52.797 --> 58:54.632
Wow.

58:54.665 --> 58:55.866
That's heavy.

58:55.900 --> 58:58.135
What did you do with the doll?

58:58.168 --> 59:00.337
I took care of it.

59:00.370 --> 59:02.773
Who would do that?

59:02.807 --> 59:04.775
It's like they know me.

59:04.809 --> 59:06.243
Like they're taunting me.

59:09.346 --> 59:11.315
Sam.

59:11.348 --> 59:13.984
I know, I know.

59:14.018 --> 59:18.022
But after the day you've had

59:18.055 --> 59:23.093
I really think you could use
a good night's rest.

59:23.127 --> 59:24.595
Come on.

59:34.238 --> 59:36.741
I'm gonna stay the night.

59:36.774 --> 59:40.010
I'm gonna take care of you.

59:40.044 --> 59:41.578
You shouldn't be alone.

59:44.314 --> 59:45.916
Thank you.

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:26.223
Sam?

01:00:27.892 --> 01:00:29.259
Sam, are you ok?

01:00:31.929 --> 01:00:32.897
It's ok, Sam.

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:34.331
Come on, let's go back to sleep.

01:00:38.803 --> 01:00:39.837
Morning.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.271
Morning.

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:43.073
Are you feeling better?

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:44.875
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.

01:00:44.909 --> 01:00:47.812
And uh, you need to get back
to your life.

01:00:47.845 --> 01:00:48.713
Hmm.

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:49.413
Are you sure?

01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:51.048
Yes.

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:52.750
That's enough taking care
of your little sister,

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:54.151
Mother Theresa.

01:00:56.787 --> 01:00:59.089
Is that work or boys?

01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:02.793
It is... oh, work.

01:01:02.827 --> 01:01:04.094
I gotta go.

01:01:04.128 --> 01:01:05.329
Ok, well at least take one
for the road.

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:07.464
Thank you.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:10.801
Thanks again for coming.

01:01:10.835 --> 01:01:12.870
What are sisters for?

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:14.338
I'll call you, ok?

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:15.172
I love you.

01:01:15.205 --> 01:01:16.173
I love you.

01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:24.815
Hello?

01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:25.916
Samantha Hastings?

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:26.884
Who is this?

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:29.119
Office Campbell.

01:01:29.153 --> 01:01:31.856
We'd like you to come down
to the precinct.

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:33.758
Is now a good time?

01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:35.025
I can be there in 20 minutes.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:40.965
How did your drawings happen to
be in Darren Zucker's vehicle?

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:43.901
We were in discussions
about a project.

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:46.003
What kind of project?

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.938
Landscaping.

01:01:47.972 --> 01:01:49.306
It's what I do.

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:51.241
I was preparing a concept design
for the tiny house

01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:52.910
in Gravity Hills.

01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:54.945
And Kyle Hastings,
he's your husband, correct?

01:01:56.781 --> 01:01:58.949
Yes.

01:01:58.983 --> 01:02:01.185
Are you aware that Darren
Zucker and your husband's

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.320
business partner Mark

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:05.122
jointly owned the deed to
that property on Gravity Hill?

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:09.193
How can that be?

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:13.097
That was a partnership
between Kyle and Mark.

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:18.435
The permit is for high density
townhouses and a shopping mall.

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:21.438
I'm sorry but no,
that's impossible.

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.207
The paperwork doesn't lie.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.443
And in these transactions
things can go south in a hurry.

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:30.815
Jealousies, disagreements,
reneging on commitments.

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.382
There's a possibility that
Mr. Zucker's death

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:33.951
was not an accident.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.089
Mrs. Hastings, what was
your husband's relationship

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:44.294
like with his business partner,
Mark Chadwick?

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:46.263
They're best friends.

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:48.432
Like brothers.

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:50.367
And did they ever disagree?

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.270
About business ventures?

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:55.172
No, not that I know of.

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:19.563
I tried to tell you, Sam.

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:21.866
How could you, Mark?

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:24.835
You guys were like brothers
and you betrayed him.

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:27.504
What was I supposed to do?

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:29.039
H.O.S.T. was Kyle's baby.

01:03:29.073 --> 01:03:30.941
I didn't know what to do
with the business anymore.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:35.245
I thought it was a good idea.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.582
Are you serious?

01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:41.018
You knew perfectly well
that Kyle wanted to maintain

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:44.588
the beauty and integrity
of this land.

01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:46.924
This was a gift for me.

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.292
I thought it would be good
for all of us.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:51.261
It would secure our futures.

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:53.630
Our futures were already
secured, Mark.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:57.534
You were the one that said that
we were all living the dream.

01:03:59.636 --> 01:04:01.438
I'm sorry, Sam.

01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:07.611
Oh, and by the way,

01:04:07.644 --> 01:04:11.115
the autopsy report came back
on Darren Zucker.

01:04:11.148 --> 01:04:14.251
Apparently he died of
blunt force trauma

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:15.519
before the accident.

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.957
It's now a homicide
investigation.

01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:24.128
It wasn't an accident, Jackie.

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:25.495
He was killed.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:26.997
Somebody whacked him and
then threw him in his car

01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:28.365
and then pushed the car
over the cliff.

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:29.599
Calm down, Sam.

01:04:29.633 --> 01:04:31.035
Jackie, did you hear me?

01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:31.969
Sam?

01:04:32.002 --> 01:04:33.503
It's now a murder investigation.

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:35.272
Whoever did it
is still out there.

01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:36.140
Alright, Sam.

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:37.307
Just slow down.

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:39.109
Take it easy.

01:04:39.143 --> 01:04:40.310
I'm coming to get you.

01:04:40.344 --> 01:04:43.080
Just stay put, I'm on my way.

01:04:43.113 --> 01:04:44.114
Do you hear me?

01:04:44.148 --> 01:04:45.349
Sam, are you listening?

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.184
I'm on my way.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:48.518
I'm waiting.

01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:29.059
Lindsey, I can't talk right now.

01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:32.496
Sam, I am so, so sorry.

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:34.298
I had no idea.

01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:37.334
Mark told me everything.

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:39.069
We'll figure it out, Linds.

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:42.406
You... you believe me, right?

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:43.407
Yeah.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.342
Yeah, I believe you.

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:47.411
Just-we'll talk about it later.

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:48.678
I'm going to Jackie's.

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:54.151
Jackie!

01:05:56.486 --> 01:05:57.621
Jackie!

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:10.267
Jackie?

01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:37.154
Jackie?

01:07:41.658 --> 01:07:43.427
Jack-Jackie, are you down here?

01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:23.133
Kyle?

01:08:23.167 --> 01:08:24.734
Kyle?

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:26.803
Kyle?

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:28.705
Oh my... Kyle?

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:33.643
Sam?

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:34.544
Sam!

01:08:34.578 --> 01:08:35.545
Oh my god!

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:37.881
Sam!

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:39.183
What happened?!

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:39.649
It's Jackie.

01:08:39.683 --> 01:08:40.783
Jackie.

01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:43.353
What're you talking about?

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:45.389
Oh, my God...

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.857
I'm trying, I'm trying!

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:48.758
You can do it.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:49.893
You can do it, babe.

01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:51.395
You can do it.

01:08:51.428 --> 01:08:52.629
Come on, baby.

01:08:54.898 --> 01:08:57.367
Oh... oh my god-why
would Jackie do this?!

01:08:57.401 --> 01:09:00.337
Oh my god!

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.305
Ok, I-Ok, I um-I
have to go upstairs.

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:03.640
I'm going to go get something,
ok?

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:04.408
Don't leave me.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:05.242
I'll get the knife.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:07.511
I'm not leaving you.

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:08.444
I'll be right back.

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:10.613
I will be right back.

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:11.781
Sam-Sam!

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:16.786
I love you.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:17.687
I love you, too.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.488
I'll be back.

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:20.557
I love you!

01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:11.275
Mmm...

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:14.711
I guess Kyle's surprise tiny
house hasn't turned out so well.

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:21.751
I wonder what he would have
thought of you if those spiders

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:26.756
had actually chewed
through your skin.

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:29.659
I was sure you'd get more
than just one bite.

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:39.503
Oh, don't be sad, Sam.

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:41.505
All's well that ends well.

01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:47.977
Can I get some water?

01:10:52.449 --> 01:10:53.483
Sure.

01:10:57.554 --> 01:11:00.023
Anything for my little sister.

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:16.706
Can I uh, get you anything else,
Sam?

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.908
Oh, I don't know, maybe like...

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:20.577
a nice bowl of fruit?

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.578
Hmm?

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:24.748
Why, Jackie?

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:28.518
Did you really think you could
get away with this?

01:11:28.552 --> 01:11:31.054
I don't know.

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:32.989
I fooled you, didn't I?

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:37.494
I'm glad you were here.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:38.695
Of course.

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:39.529
Here, an iced tea
with fresh lemon,

01:11:39.563 --> 01:11:40.864
just the way you like it.

01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:41.965
Oh, you didn't have to bother.

01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:43.467
It's no bother, Kyle.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.969
I always keep some ready
in case you pop by.

01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:48.071
Well, thank you.

01:11:48.104 --> 01:11:50.006
You know, for listening.

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:52.542
I just felt so selfish.

01:11:52.576 --> 01:11:56.346
I mean, all Sam needs right
now is my love and my support.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.414
I gave her none of that.

01:11:57.447 --> 01:11:58.415
No.

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:00.484
No, don't blame yourself.

01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:04.421
It hurts that she can't carry
your babies.

01:12:04.454 --> 01:12:07.524
That she doesn't want to.

01:12:07.557 --> 01:12:12.496
But... that's ok.

01:12:12.529 --> 01:12:15.131
Because now we can be
together again.

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:16.366
Right?

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.101
Uh, Jackie.

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:21.371
Uh... I'm sorry, I didn't mean
anything by coming here,

01:12:21.405 --> 01:12:22.706
you know that, right?

01:12:22.739 --> 01:12:23.873
I just thought that maybe
you'd have some insight

01:12:23.907 --> 01:12:27.844
in how Sam's been feeling
lately 'cause you're her sister.

01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:29.946
I love Sam.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:30.947
I've only ever loved Sam.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:31.881
I know.

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:32.782
But you and I, we had this...

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:34.984
We dated in high school
for a few weeks.

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:36.085
That was it.

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:42.859
I'm gonna go.

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:44.894
She's toxic, Kyle.

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:46.796
She can't even keep
your babies alive.

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:47.797
Jackie, stop this!

01:12:47.831 --> 01:12:48.898
I can carry your babies!

01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:49.466
Don't.

01:12:49.499 --> 01:12:50.099
Jackie...

01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:50.900
As many as you want.

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:51.334
As many as you want!

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:51.935
Jack-Jackie!

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:57.040
I don't know what this is

01:12:57.073 --> 01:12:59.909
but there's something
wrong with you.

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:02.779
Ok?

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:04.013
I'm just gonna go.

01:13:09.018 --> 01:13:14.023
I'm not sure what started this,
but... just let go, alright?

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:27.103
You took him from me, Sam.

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:29.739
The life I was entitled to.

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:38.615
But that's ok.

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:48.057
When you couldn't keep
his babies anymore

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:52.862
it was only a matter of time
before he came back to me.

01:13:52.896 --> 01:13:56.666
You told me you were
happy for us.

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.503
What was I supposed to say?

01:13:59.536 --> 01:14:00.804
Huh?

01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:02.839
Congratulations?

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:05.909
Once again you got
what you wanted.

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:08.945
Perfect Sam, the one who mom
loves best.

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:11.648
The one who-who never
gets dumped.

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:14.618
Never loses her job.

01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:18.788
I mean, do you have any idea

01:14:18.822 --> 01:14:22.559
what it's like to be
tossed aside?

01:14:22.592 --> 01:14:23.727
Hmm?

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.830
Traded in for another?

01:14:26.863 --> 01:14:31.968
I thought when I met Ian
things would be different.

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:35.872
But no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:14:35.905 --> 01:14:38.808
He left Jackie, too.

01:14:38.842 --> 01:14:41.978
I'm sorry, Jackie.

01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:43.613
I really am.

01:14:46.616 --> 01:14:48.284
You're sorry?

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:51.220
That's a joke, right?

01:14:51.254 --> 01:14:53.256
Sam is sorry.

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:54.891
Oh.

01:14:54.924 --> 01:14:57.126
You know I lost my hospital job
stealing those pills

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.928
I was giving to you?

01:14:58.962 --> 01:15:01.565
And if you had taken them
like I told you to

01:15:01.598 --> 01:15:03.166
you'd be out of my hair by now.

01:15:07.303 --> 01:15:09.873
Look at me.

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:11.741
Look at me, Sam.

01:15:14.678 --> 01:15:16.980
This is all your fault.

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:19.015
You forced me into this.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:29.058
Soon, Kyle.

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:31.595
Soon I won't have to hide
our love anymore.

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:37.300
Mmm.

01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:39.936
Take off the gag.

01:15:39.969 --> 01:15:41.237
What?

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:44.107
Say it again.

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.609
Take the gag off, please?

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:50.146
Because you said "please".

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:01.958
Any chance we can loosen
these ropes?

01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:06.830
Please?

01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:08.798
Just let me go.

01:16:08.832 --> 01:16:11.300
I promise you I won't
tell anyone.

01:16:11.334 --> 01:16:12.669
Ever.

01:16:14.838 --> 01:16:16.039
You don't understand, Kyle.

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:26.883
It's not time yet.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.351
What?

01:16:28.384 --> 01:16:30.086
No, no, no, no, no.

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:31.788
No more of that, alright?

01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:32.856
Come on.

01:16:32.889 --> 01:16:33.823
Kyle.

01:16:33.857 --> 01:16:34.791
Don't touch me.

01:16:34.824 --> 01:16:36.159
Kyle.

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:39.095
You know I can't have anyone
finding you.

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:42.398
Especially not Sam.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.902
She left.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.003
She left town.

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:47.804
Lie.

01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:49.038
She did.

01:16:49.072 --> 01:16:52.976
Don't worry, I'm gonna
take care of her.

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:54.177
Don't you touch her.

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:56.846
Forever.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.047
Where'd you get that?!

01:16:58.081 --> 01:16:58.882
Kyle.

01:16:58.915 --> 01:16:59.883
Where'd you get it?

01:16:59.916 --> 01:17:00.950
I swear, if you touch her...

01:17:00.984 --> 01:17:02.418
Kyle.

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.888
Don't touch me!!!

01:17:04.921 --> 01:17:06.122
You make me sick.

01:17:06.155 --> 01:17:08.792
Utterly sick.

01:17:08.825 --> 01:17:10.960
You don't hold a candle
to your sister.

01:17:10.994 --> 01:17:13.162
You never will.

01:17:13.196 --> 01:17:15.699
That's right.

01:17:17.266 --> 01:17:19.736
I hate you.

01:17:19.769 --> 01:17:22.238
You might have my body,
but you'll never have me.

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:23.239
Shh.

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:24.908
Never. Ever.

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:35.351
Now what am I gonna do?

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:38.922
What am I gonna do?

01:17:57.741 --> 01:17:59.709
Oh, you'd be surprised
what you learn at a hospital,

01:17:59.743 --> 01:18:02.946
little sister.

01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:05.248
Some patients
can be very tricky.

01:18:07.951 --> 01:18:09.118
Now.

01:18:11.855 --> 01:18:15.892
You need to stay away
from sharp objects, Sam.

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:16.993
You could get hurt.

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:22.198
Jackie.

01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:27.971
Jackie!!!!!!!!!

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:30.306
Lockdown initiated.

01:18:32.008 --> 01:18:33.810
Lockdown initiated.

01:18:33.843 --> 01:18:35.945
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!

01:18:35.979 --> 01:18:36.946
Lockdown initiated.

01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:40.784
Lockdown initiated.

01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:45.855
Jackie!

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:48.224
Please, Jackie.

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:49.158
Please.

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:52.495
You're safe now, Sam.

01:18:52.528 --> 01:18:54.130
Jackie, please.

01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:56.065
Please don't do this, Jackie!

01:18:56.099 --> 01:18:57.400
Please!

01:18:57.433 --> 01:18:58.467
Jackie!

01:19:02.205 --> 01:19:03.272
Lockdown initiated.

01:19:24.894 --> 01:19:26.162
Jackie!

01:19:42.045 --> 01:19:43.046
Come on.

01:19:43.079 --> 01:19:44.047
Come on!

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:31.194
911, what's your emergency?

01:20:37.967 --> 01:20:38.935
H.O.S.T. off!

01:20:42.638 --> 01:20:44.373
H.O.S.T. off!

01:20:44.407 --> 01:20:46.009
Please turn off!

01:20:47.643 --> 01:20:48.411
H.O.S.T. of...

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:25.014
The whole system
must have glitched.

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:26.182
I bet she's trapped inside.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:27.450
Units one and two.

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:28.617
Take positions behind
the vehicle.

01:21:28.651 --> 01:21:29.518
I'm going in.

01:21:29.552 --> 01:21:30.886
Wait for my signal.

01:21:45.168 --> 01:21:45.935
Sam!

01:22:07.323 --> 01:22:08.291
Now, now, now, now, now!

01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:16.065
Sam!

01:22:16.099 --> 01:22:16.532
Sam!

01:22:16.565 --> 01:22:17.266
Kyle!

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:17.700
Sam!

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:18.267
Kyle!

01:22:18.301 --> 01:22:18.701
Help me!

01:22:18.734 --> 01:22:19.568
Help me!

01:22:19.602 --> 01:22:20.336
I don't know what to do!

01:22:20.369 --> 01:22:21.204
I'll be right back!

01:22:21.237 --> 01:22:22.271
I'm turning off H.O.S.T.!

01:22:22.305 --> 01:22:23.439
Kyle!

01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:44.460
H.O.S.T. system deactivate.

01:23:03.179 --> 01:23:04.147
Easy now.

01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:08.017
Easy.

01:23:14.457 --> 01:23:15.258
Sam!

01:23:15.291 --> 01:23:16.192
Hang on, I'm coming!

01:23:18.294 --> 01:23:19.495
Hang on!

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:22.265
Help me with this!

01:23:22.298 --> 01:23:23.699
Come on, come on.

01:23:25.134 --> 01:23:26.202
Hurry! Hurry!

01:23:29.705 --> 01:23:31.374
It's ok. I got you.

01:23:31.407 --> 01:23:32.275
I got you.

01:23:35.178 --> 01:23:35.811
It's ok.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.480
It's ok.

01:23:45.621 --> 01:23:47.356
Founder Kyle Hastings
latest venture is nothing

01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:49.058
short of innovative.

01:23:49.092 --> 01:23:50.759
Something we've grown
to expect from the company

01:23:50.793 --> 01:23:55.164
behind Gravity Hills' newest
and most unique development.

01:23:55.198 --> 01:23:56.832
Uh, yeah.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:58.067
I think what's unique about
our community of tiny houses

01:23:58.101 --> 01:24:00.069
is just the effort

01:24:00.103 --> 01:24:02.138
and the work that my wife
and I have put into,

01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:03.372
you know, working
with the local community

01:24:03.406 --> 01:24:05.174
and the local environmentalists

01:24:05.208 --> 01:24:06.542
to ensure that the natural
landscape

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:09.678
has been unaltered
as much as possible.

01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:10.813
Not too hard to do
when you're building

01:24:10.846 --> 01:24:13.149
a house that's 300 square feet.

01:24:13.182 --> 01:24:16.119
But make no mistake, these
tiny houses are fully loaded

01:24:16.152 --> 01:24:18.421
and they're perfect for a family of two...

01:24:18.454 --> 01:24:24.527
Oh Kyle, you're always
thinking of us.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.129
We'll be together again soon.

01:24:27.463 --> 01:24:28.664
Lights off.
