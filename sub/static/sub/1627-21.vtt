14:20.527 --> 14:22.609
for one last journey.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.104
Where?

14:26.450 --> 14:28.031
Back to our land.

14:28.660 --> 14:32.699
Where there's a solution
to a very delicate problem I have.

14:32.789 --> 14:36.122
How to get rid of the one person
who could break my curse.

14:36.960 --> 14:37.949
Emma.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.629
And why shouldn't I let her do just that?

14:42.716 --> 14:44.672
End the madness and go home.

14:44.885 --> 14:45.874

is the same as yours.

15:06.281 --> 15:07.737
lt's family.

15:08.992 --> 15:12.325
We both want our children back.
And we both can get them.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.078
If we work together.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.614
Why should I trust you now?

15:17.709 --> 15:19.324
You shouldn't.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.661
But it's the only offer you've got.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.706
After we're through,
l'll wake up your dear Grace,

15:25.801 --> 15:27.086
so she remembers who you are.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.212
No.

15:31.473 --> 15:34.636
Remembering is the worst curse.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.559
Two lives in her head, like me.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.724
I want to forget.

15:40.357 --> 15:43.315
I want you to write us a new story.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.360
A fresh start, here.

15:49.783 --> 15:53.446
Well, my dear Jefferson,
then that's exactly what you'll have.

15:57.374 --> 15:58.363
Oh.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.542
After we take care of Miss Swan.

You were gonna
make her believe. You have to.

I'm sorry. I failed.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.447
Failed?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.490
I tried to show her.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.198
First it was my legs.

20:06.289 --> 20:09.622
And now, now take a look

at the unvarnished truth.

been a good boy.

And,

20:48.957 --> 20:50.367
(PAINED EXHALE)

20:51.751 --> 20:53.207
well, if the curse doesn't break,

20:54.712 --> 20:56.327
this doesn't stop.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.710
So we show Emma that you're turning
back into the puppet you were.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.792
And then she has to believe!

21:01.886 --> 21:04.047
And when she does,
she could break the curse.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.299
I tried that.

21:05.390 --> 21:08.507
She doesn't want to see.
So she doesn't.

21:09.436 --> 21:12.178
There's nothing more that I can do.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.558
I'm getting tired.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.732
It's hard to ride and it's hard to walk.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.355
Soon it's gonna be hard to breathe.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.855
So we have to do something fast.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.281

21:25.743 --> 21:30.863

but I'm out of Operation Cobra.

But I'm afraid you don't have
any case for custody.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.235
Even after everything she's done?

22:10.330 --> 22:11.365
Which you can't prove.

22:12.832 --> 22:13.947
Let me just ask you a question.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.078
With this war raging on,
who really is getting hurt here?

22:16.169 --> 22:17.158
I know. Henry.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.993
But isn't it a good thing
that he's spending time with me?

22:19.088 --> 22:20.043
l'm his mother.

22:20.131 --> 22:21.917
Yes, you are.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.256
And so is Regina.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.880
And, well, look, the court is gonna
come in and look at him

22:26.971 --> 22:28.632
and see how he's been
since you've come into his life.

22:28.723 --> 22:29.838
And he's been happier, right?

22:30.850 --> 22:33.182
Maybe. But objectively? (SCOFFS)

22:33.353 --> 22:35.719
He's skipped school,
he's stolen a credit card, he's run off,

22:35.813 --> 22:38.190
he's endangered himself. Repeatedly.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.480
And so, in the eyes of the law,
it's not so...

22:39.567 --> 22:41.649
What about in your eyes?
What do you think?

22:43.404 --> 22:47.488
Well, I mean, a while ago, I told you
to engage him in his fantasy life,

22:47.575 --> 22:48.985
and perhaps it was wrong.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.942
Because he's only retreated
further into it.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.489
You think he's better off with her?

22:53.373 --> 22:54.988
I never said that.

22:59.254 --> 23:02.041
Do you think that
she would ever hurt him?

23:02.131 --> 23:04.042
No. Never.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.386
I mean, everyone else, but not him.

23:14.602 --> 23:18.140
but in many ways, your arrival
has woken a sleeping dragon.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.597
Tell me honestly,

23:21.734 --> 23:23.645
has he been better off since I got here?

23:24.320 --> 23:25.309
Oh.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.521
It's not a matter of better off.

Have you ever heard of a parley?

25:15.431 --> 25:19.674
We break off all this messy fighting
and have a little talk.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.180
Just you and me.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.772
Come unarmed.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.099
Where do I meet you?

25:29.320 --> 25:31.151

and unarmed.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.823
It's a parley. There are rules.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.034
You're too noble for your own good.

25:46.129 --> 25:47.244
I'm not.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.044
But enough of you
have risked your lives

25:49.132 --> 25:51.418

I don't like this.

Watch your step.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.668
What is this place?

26:34.552 --> 26:37.339
Where I've kept the last bit of my magic.

26:37.930 --> 26:41.764
The only magic in this world is in
the things I brought with me.

26:56.741 --> 26:59.323
(SIGHS) It's not spinning.
It's not working.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.868
It needs to absorb the magic that's here.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.322
l have some things left.

27:06.918 --> 27:08.874
A few trinkets.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.228
It's not enough.
You need something that still works.

Who's that?

27:39.575 --> 27:41.315

Well, whatever or whoever it is,

27:44.789 --> 27:46.745

what I can do with it.

If you want your son back,
if you want your revenge,

27:53.422 --> 27:55.834
give it to me.

28:16.279 --> 28:18.361
What's wrong?

28:18.823 --> 28:20.188
Why isn't it opening a portal?

28:20.950 --> 28:23.737
The magic. It's not enough.
We can't go anywhere.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.194
Then you've failed.

28:26.289 --> 28:27.620
Maybe not.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.368
There's enough magic
to touch the other side,

28:29.458 --> 28:31.039
just not to get us there.

28:31.127 --> 28:34.119
There might be enough to reach
through and retrieve something.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.796
I can bring something back?

28:38.551 --> 28:40.132
Is there an object that can help you?

28:40.219 --> 28:43.632
Perhaps I can open it enough
and reach through and grab it.

28:43.723 --> 28:45.133
It would have to be small.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.883
Something that you can
take with your hand.

28:47.977 --> 28:50.093
Is there anything like that
that can help you?

28:50.813 --> 28:54.852
Yes. Yes, I believe there is.

28:56.068 --> 28:59.981
Then you need to direct me to the time
and place where this object exists.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.025
How?

29:02.575 --> 29:04.190
Think about it.

It appears to be working.

when I saved your life?

30:26.200 --> 30:27.531
Of course.

-A grave.

Daniel's grave.

30:45.428 --> 30:48.261
Daniel. But I thought...

30:48.347 --> 30:50.087
He ran away?

30:51.308 --> 30:56.098
I told you that to spare your feelings.
Out of kindness.

30:57.398 --> 30:59.184
But he died because of you.

31:01.652 --> 31:02.641

31:05.156 --> 31:06.191
I'm sorry.

31:06.282 --> 31:07.772

31:08.659 --> 31:11.071
But nothing can change
what happened.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.163
What you did.

31:13.247 --> 31:16.159
You promised to keep my secret.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.995
You promised, but you lied.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.462
I was very young, and your mother...

31:20.546 --> 31:24.255
She ripped his heart out.
Because of you.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.336

What is that?

31:39.565 --> 31:41.476
It's just a morsel.

31:43.778 --> 31:46.815
Did you know that apples
stand for health and wisdom?

31:46.906 --> 31:48.897
So why do I get the feeling
that one might kill me?

31:48.991 --> 31:50.652
It won't kill you.

31:50.951 --> 31:53.738
No, what it will do is far worse.

31:53.829 --> 31:56.366
Your body will be your tomb

31:56.457 --> 32:01.372
and you'll be in there with nothing
but dreams formed of your own regrets.

32:01.796 --> 32:03.502
And you're going to force me to eat it.

32:04.715 --> 32:07.377
(CHUCKLES) No. Of course not.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.292
It wouldn't work anyway.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.091
The choice is yours.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.464
It must be taken willingly.

32:15.559 --> 32:18.392
And why would I do that?

32:18.479 --> 32:20.595
Because if you refuse the apple,

32:20.689 --> 32:23.852
your Prince, your Charming,

32:25.361 --> 32:26.851
Will be killed.

32:28.739 --> 32:30.024
No.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.357
As I said, the choice is yours.

32:34.370 --> 32:36.452
I take that apple and he lives?

Right. Look, this isn't easy.

I think that this...

Whatever is between us needs to end.

At last, something we can agree on.

I had left.

To get you to eat that.

41:42.292 --> 41:43.793
To get rid of the savior.

41:43.877 --> 41:46.994
Henry, come on. Why would she do that
when ljust told her I was gonna go?

41:47.089 --> 41:49.796
Because as long as you're alive,
you're a threat to the curse.

41:49.883 --> 41:51.965
Henry, you've gotta stop
thinking like this.

41:52.052 --> 41:53.167
But it's the truth.

41:53.261 --> 41:55.297
And your leaving
isn't gonna change that.

You may not believe in the curse.
Or in me.
