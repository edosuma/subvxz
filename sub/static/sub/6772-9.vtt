00:02.750 --> 00:04.680
Wow, what a gorgeous day.

00:05.170 --> 00:08.520
Rainbow Dash must have got up early for once and cleared all the clouds away.

00:08.970 --> 00:12.320
I bet all in Ponyville is got to be out enjoying the sunshine.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.960
What? Where is everypony?

00:22.220 --> 00:24.300
Is it some sort of pony holiday?

00:24.300 --> 00:25.600
Not that I know of.

00:26.010 --> 00:27.580
Does my breath stink?

00:29.620 --> 00:31.300
Not more than usual.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.640
Is it... zombies?!

00:33.640 --> 00:35.170
Nuh-uh... Not very likely.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.410
Not likely, but possible?

00:38.410 --> 00:39.640
*whispering* Pssst...

00:41.910 --> 00:43.470
Twilight!

00:44.250 --> 00:46.410
Spike! Come here!

00:47.190 --> 00:48.610
Come! Here!

00:48.790 --> 00:52.290
Hurry, before she gets you!

00:54.970 --> 00:57.280
Uh, who? The zombie pony?

00:57.500 --> 00:59.700
Zombie pony??

01:00.960 --> 01:03.340
Spike, there are no zombie ponies.

01:03.340 --> 01:06.210
Pinkie, what are you doing here alone in the dark?

01:06.210 --> 01:07.890
I'm not alone in the dark.

01:08.930 --> 01:11.650
Okay then, what are you all doing here in the dark?

01:11.870 --> 01:14.470
We're hiding from HER.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

02:03.890 --> 02:07.280
Did you see her, Twilight? Did you see Zecora?

02:07.280 --> 02:09.919
Applebloom. I told you never to say that name.

02:09.919 --> 02:12.190
Well, I saw her glance this way.

02:12.190 --> 02:15.170
Glance eeeevilly this way.

02:15.170 --> 02:17.890
And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason.

02:17.890 --> 02:19.670
No good reason?!

02:19.670 --> 02:22.240
You called protecting your kin "no good reason"?

02:22.240 --> 02:25.630
While as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town,

02:25.630 --> 02:27.970
she's started shaking in her little horse-shoes.

02:27.970 --> 02:29.910
D.i.d. .n.o.t.

02:29.910 --> 02:32.070
So I swept

02:32.070 --> 02:33.890
I walked here myself!

02:33.890 --> 02:35.080
For safe keep.

02:35.080 --> 02:39.250
Applejack! I'm not a baby. I can take care of myself.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.520
Not from that creepy Zecora.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.460
She's mysterious.

02:43.460 --> 02:44.950
Sinister.

02:44.950 --> 02:47.890
And spooooooky.

02:55.850 --> 02:58.230
Will you cut that out?!

02:58.230 --> 03:01.290
Just look at those stripes! So garish.

03:01.550 --> 03:03.150
She's a zebra.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.670
A what?!

03:04.670 --> 03:08.470
A zebra. And her stripes aren't a fashion choice, Rarity.

03:08.470 --> 03:10.070
They're what she was born with.

03:12.010 --> 03:15.840
Born weird. I never seen a pony like that in this parts,

03:15.840 --> 03:17.510
except HER.

03:17.510 --> 03:20.830
Well, she's probably not from here. And she's not a pony.

03:20.830 --> 03:23.800
My book say that zebras come from a far away land.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.230
But I've never seen her in Ponyville. Where does she live?

03:27.230 --> 03:32.740
That's just it. She lives in the Everfree Forest!

03:34.450 --> 03:35.600
Spike!

03:35.600 --> 03:37.130
Eh. Sorry.

03:37.610 --> 03:40.400
The Everfree Forest just ain't natural,

03:40.400 --> 03:41.890
the plants grow,

03:41.890 --> 03:44.090
animals care for themselves,

03:44.090 --> 03:46.140
and the clouds move

03:46.140 --> 03:48.370
ALL ON THEIR OWN!

03:50.120 --> 03:54.180
And that wicked Enchantress, Zecora, lives there doing her evil... stuff!

03:54.180 --> 03:56.600
Oh, she's so evil, I even wrote a song about her.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.010
Here we go...

03:58.010 --> 03:59.500
<i>She's an evil enchantress</i>

03:59.500 --> 04:00.840
<i>And she does evil dances</i>

04:00.840 --> 04:02.250
<i>And if you look deep in her eyes</i>

04:02.250 --> 04:03.670
<i>She will put you in trances</i>

04:03.670 --> 04:04.900
<i>Then what will she do?</i>

04:04.900 --> 04:06.380
<i>She'll mix up an evil brew</i>

04:06.380 --> 04:07.650
<i>And she'll gobble you up</i>

04:07.650 --> 04:08.800
<i>In a big tasty stew</i>

04:08.800 --> 04:10.030
<i>So... watch out!</i>

04:13.080 --> 04:14.460
Wow... Catchy.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.430
It's a work-in-progress.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.700
This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors.

04:18.700 --> 04:22.540
Now tell me, what exactly have you actually seen Zecora do?

04:22.540 --> 04:23.660
Well...

04:24.250 --> 04:28.010
Once a month... she comes into Ponyville.

04:28.010 --> 04:29.160
Ooooh...

04:29.160 --> 04:32.070
Then... she lurks by the stores...

04:32.070 --> 04:33.890
Oh my!

04:33.890 --> 04:37.090
And then... she digs at the ground.

04:37.090 --> 04:39.180
Good gracious!

04:39.510 --> 04:42.600
OK. I'm sorry... But how is any of this bad?

04:42.600 --> 04:44.910
Maybe she comes to town to visit?

04:44.910 --> 04:47.550
Yeah. Maybe she's just trying to be neighborly.

04:47.550 --> 04:51.650
And maybe she's not lurking by the stores. Maybe she's going to them,

04:51.650 --> 04:53.770
lurk free, to do some shopping.

04:53.770 --> 04:57.450
Yeah. Everypony likes to shop. You know what I think?

04:57.450 --> 04:59.870
Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk.

04:59.870 --> 05:02.140
I am a big pony...

05:02.510 --> 05:06.980
What about digging at the ground? You got to admit - that's weird.

05:06.980 --> 05:10.330
What if she's digging for innocent creatures?

05:10.330 --> 05:13.570
*Pinkie Pie singing in the background*
I'm sure there is an explanation for everything Zecora does.

05:13.570 --> 05:18.780
And if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth.

05:18.780 --> 05:22.610
Well, I'm brave enough. I'm gonna find out myself.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.880
You ponies are being ridiculous.

05:45.880 --> 05:49.670
Well, I heard that Zecora... eats hay.

05:49.670 --> 05:53.100
Pinkie, I eat hay, you eat hay!

05:53.100 --> 05:56.630
Yeah... But I heard it's the eeeevil way she eats hay...

05:56.630 --> 05:58.870
Hey! Where's Applebloom?

05:58.870 --> 06:00.880
The door's open!

06:00.880 --> 06:02.360
She went outside!

06:02.360 --> 06:04.900
And Zecora's still out there!

06:04.900 --> 06:08.390
That silly little filly. I've told her to stay put!

06:08.390 --> 06:11.600
Spike, you stay here in case Applebloom comes back.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.270
Will do!

06:37.170 --> 06:38.280
Applebloom?!

06:40.520 --> 06:42.710
You get back here right now!

06:42.710 --> 06:45.730
Beware! Beware, you ponyfolk!

06:45.730 --> 06:48.260
Those leaves of blue are not a joke!

06:48.850 --> 06:52.500
Y-You keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, you hear?

06:52.500 --> 06:54.880
Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!

06:54.880 --> 06:57.750
[gobble you up in a big tasty stew]

06:57.750 --> 06:59.130
Oh, brother...

06:59.420 --> 07:02.630
Beware! Beware!

07:02.810 --> 07:08.540
Yeah. Bat catch you Zecora. You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware.

07:08.540 --> 07:12.190
And you! Why couldn't you just listen to your big sister?

07:12.190 --> 07:13.640
I-I...

07:13.640 --> 07:16.700
Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could've just put on you?

07:16.840 --> 07:18.260
Just like in my song!

07:18.260 --> 07:20.790
[...evil enchantress and ... evil dances...]

07:20.790 --> 07:22.200
[..and the trances]

07:22.200 --> 07:24.770
You guys, there's no such thing as curses!

07:25.000 --> 07:29.610
Well, that's interesting to hear coming from this magic pants herself.

07:29.610 --> 07:34.150
My magic, real magic, comes from within. It's a skill you're born with,

07:34.150 --> 07:36.530
Curses are artificial, fake magic.

07:36.530 --> 07:41.070
It's counter with potions and incantations, while all smoke and mirrors meant to scare.

07:41.070 --> 07:44.690
But curses have no real power. They're just an old pony tale.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.100
Just you wait, Twilight.

07:47.100 --> 07:51.610
You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true.

07:57.150 --> 08:00.430
[She's an evil enchantress and she does evil dances]

08:00.430 --> 08:04.300
[Beware! Beware!]

08:04.930 --> 08:08.280
[And if you look deep in her eyes she will put you in trances]

08:08.280 --> 08:10.740
[Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!]

08:10.740 --> 08:11.970
[Wicked, wicked, seizor]

08:11.970 --> 08:12.490
[...curse]

08:12.490 --> 08:13.980
[Then what will she do?]

08:14.160 --> 08:18.300
[Just you wait, Twilight... some pony tales really are true.]

08:18.300 --> 08:21.870
[And she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew]

08:21.870 --> 08:28.830
[So... WATCH OUT!  *MWAHAHAA*]

08:31.770 --> 08:34.190
Ohh... What a dream.

08:34.190 --> 08:35.940
Curses-shmurses.

08:36.679 --> 08:40.890
Wow. Heh. Maybe Zecora cursed my hair... he-he.

08:45.130 --> 08:46.960
Or she cursed my horn!

08:49.060 --> 08:51.340
No, no, no, No, NO!

08:51.740 --> 08:53.570
None of these books have a cure!

08:54.570 --> 08:56.840
There has to be a real reason for this.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.080
An illness? An allergy?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.600
A curse!

09:00.600 --> 09:02.090
I said a real reason.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.440
Something that points to something real.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.930
How about this one?

09:06.710 --> 09:08.350
Supernaturals?

09:08.530 --> 09:13.300
Spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies.

09:13.300 --> 09:17.280
Which are as make-believe as curses! This books is just a bunch of hooey!

09:18.130 --> 09:21.260
But what if you're wrong, Twilight? What if this really is a...

09:21.260 --> 09:22.790
*a a truth!*

09:23.160 --> 09:25.360
A purse? How could it be a purse?

09:25.360 --> 09:27.700
Pinkie! What happened?

09:27.700 --> 09:31.090
*pfipfe pfupfopf pfu*

09:31.090 --> 09:33.920
Hey! Say it, don't spray it, Pinkie.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.510
*ouch*

09:35.670 --> 09:36.450
*ow*

09:37.300 --> 09:39.460
She's... trying to say *ouch*

09:39.760 --> 09:44.380
Zecora... she slabbed us all with a... curse!

09:44.640 --> 09:46.460
I'm afraid I have to agree.

09:49.140 --> 09:53.270
I hate to say I told you so, Twilight, but I told you so.

09:54.310 --> 09:56.550
It's a curse I tells ya.

09:56.550 --> 09:59.600
But Fluttershy seems just fine.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.060
Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.370
Fluttershy, are you okay?

10:06.740 --> 10:09.310
Is there something wrong with you?

10:09.980 --> 10:12.140
Would you care to tell us?

10:12.630 --> 10:15.860
So, you're not gonna tell us?

10:16.650 --> 10:19.030
Yes - you're not, or yes - you will?

10:19.030 --> 10:22.490
Good greaty, girl. What's wrong with you?

10:23.420 --> 10:25.690
*deep low voice*
I don't wanna talk about it.

10:27.810 --> 10:31.940
This is hilarious! Look at all of you. We got:

10:31.940 --> 10:32.840
"Hair"-ity,

10:32.840 --> 10:34.330
Rainbow "Crash",

10:34.330 --> 10:35.780
"Spitty" Pie,

10:35.780 --> 10:37.010
Apple-"tini",

10:37.010 --> 10:38.490
Flutter-"guy" and...

10:38.680 --> 10:41.620
eh... I got nothing.

10:41.620 --> 10:45.270
"Twilight Sparkle"... I mean, seriously, I can't even work with that.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.840
Ha-ha-ha. This is no joke, Spike.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.740
Now start looking for more books so I can find the cure.

10:56.730 --> 11:00.160
I think we'll find the cure to this curse at Zecora's place.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.500
It's not a curse.

11:02.690 --> 11:07.860
I agree with Dash. We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex.

11:07.860 --> 11:09.980
It's not a hex, either!

11:14.640 --> 11:19.770
This is all my fault. If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would've happen.

11:19.770 --> 11:22.410
I just got to fix this.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.140
Now where does she think she's going this time?

11:28.520 --> 11:34.770
I don't care what you say, Twilight. It's time to 'pony up', and confront Zecora! Come on, girls.

11:34.770 --> 11:35.780
Are you with me?

11:35.780 --> 11:36.970
*ayathpf*

11:36.970 --> 11:38.380
And I as well.

11:38.680 --> 11:42.630
I-I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.120
How about you, Applejack?

11:46.720 --> 11:47.730
Applejack?

11:48.100 --> 11:49.620
*shfe'f gonpf*

11:50.260 --> 11:52.680
Or somepony stepped on her?

11:54.390 --> 11:56.510
Or sat on her?..

11:58.670 --> 12:00.450
Rarity's hair!

12:00.450 --> 12:03.660
Ow, aw! Pinkie?! What are you doing?!

12:03.840 --> 12:06.370
Really! Did you hear of personal space?

12:06.860 --> 12:07.900
*nopf*

12:07.900 --> 12:09.690
Applebloom is gone too!

12:09.690 --> 12:11.810
I bet they went after Zecora.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.440
Well, we better go find them.

12:14.260 --> 12:15.900
Come on, girls. Let's go.

12:16.720 --> 12:17.580
Oh, dear.

12:18.060 --> 12:20.260
Oh, this is so unseemly.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.230
Hey! A little help here.

12:23.230 --> 12:25.880
Oopsie. Sorry.

12:30.900 --> 12:34.330
Eeemm... S-Spike? Are you coming?

12:34.330 --> 12:38.980
Nope. Em. Got to stay here and look for a cure.

12:39.310 --> 12:41.470
Oh! "Twilight Flopple"!

12:45.860 --> 12:47.730
Stop right there.

12:49.590 --> 12:51.890
Turn around right now, missy.

12:52.530 --> 12:53.940
No.

12:53.940 --> 12:58.260
No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister.

13:01.720 --> 13:05.260
Sorry, Applejack, but I'm the big sister now.

13:05.630 --> 13:08.790
Applebloom, you come back here right this instant!

13:08.980 --> 13:11.990
I'm gonna tell Big Macintosh on you!

13:12.700 --> 13:15.120
Ow, pony feathers.

13:17.390 --> 13:20.780
Come on, girls. We've got to get to Zecora's. Hurry!

13:23.940 --> 13:25.690
Easier said than done.

13:25.690 --> 13:29.080
Hey! Wait for me!

13:36.070 --> 13:39.830
Rainbow! Thanks Celestia. There's no time to lose!

13:43.480 --> 13:45.830
I need to get to Zecora's pronto.

13:45.830 --> 13:47.320
Get it up, pony!

13:47.320 --> 13:49.740
Eexcuuuseee me?!

13:49.740 --> 13:52.270
*YEEEHAWW*

13:52.270 --> 13:53.640
What tha?!

13:54.050 --> 13:56.140
No, Rainbow Dash, the other way!

14:02.540 --> 14:05.330
Ew, I look horrible!

14:05.480 --> 14:07.680
*thithp pflapth lopth horipfl*

14:07.680 --> 14:11.030
Oh, my. That place really does look horrible.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.900
Nice decorations.

14:14.900 --> 14:17.350
If you like creepy.

14:30.160 --> 14:34.250
*pth spththe mithn! pth spththe mithn!*

14:34.250 --> 14:36.150
She stole your song?

14:36.150 --> 14:39.720
No, Pinky, doesn't sound anything like your song.

14:47.730 --> 14:51.970
<i>She's an evil enchantress and she does evil dances</i>

14:51.970 --> 14:56.510
<i>And if you look deep in her eyes she will put you in trances</i>

14:56.510 --> 15:00.010
<i>Then what will she do? She'll mix up an evil brew</i>

15:00.010 --> 15:03.620
<i>And she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew</i>

15:03.620 --> 15:07.150
<i>So... watch out.</i>

15:07.150 --> 15:11.470
You saw those terrible things. Now you believe us, Twilight?

15:12.440 --> 15:17.990
Scary-looking masks, confusing incantations and a great big bubbling cauldron?

15:17.990 --> 15:22.340
Oh... Everything is pointing to Zecora being... bad.

15:22.340 --> 15:26.660
Or... What if Zecora's just making soup?

15:27.070 --> 15:32.990
Um... The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume. Now ....

15:32.990 --> 15:36.300
where is that little Appleboom?

15:36.300 --> 15:41.250
Or...  What if she's making Appleboom soup?!

15:41.500 --> 15:45.110
What if she's making Appleboom soup?!

15:49.020 --> 15:51.550
I'm coming for ya, Applebloom!

15:55.420 --> 15:59.180
Wow there! Easy Rainbow Crash.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.990
What have you done with Appleboom?!

16:05.990 --> 16:07.700
No! No!

16:21.700 --> 16:24.560
Ponies, what is this you do?

16:25.190 --> 16:27.990
No! You know not what you do.

16:27.990 --> 16:30.890
You've gone and spilled my precious brew!

16:30.890 --> 16:36.320
We're on to you, Zecora. I did not want to believe that you've cursed us. But the evidence is overwhelming.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.520
You made me look ridiculous.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.790
You made me sound ridiculous.

16:40.790 --> 16:43.770
***You made my tongue ridiculous!***

16:43.770 --> 16:45.550
You ruined my horn!

16:45.550 --> 16:47.270
How dare you?!

16:47.270 --> 16:50.210
You destroy my home, destroy my work.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.180
Then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?!

16:53.370 --> 16:55.080
You've put this curse on us!

16:55.080 --> 16:56.790
Now you're gonna uncurse us.

16:56.790 --> 16:59.850
It is unwise to be into down this road.

16:59.850 --> 17:02.860
Your actions will make my anger explode!

17:02.860 --> 17:05.359
Where is Applebloom?

17:06.099 --> 17:09.670
Zecora, I think I found all the things you've asked for.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.099
What in Ponyvile is going on here?!

17:13.920 --> 17:16.599
Applebloom! You're okay!

17:16.599 --> 17:17.680
Why wouldn't I be?

17:17.680 --> 17:21.960
Because Zecora is an evil Enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up in a soup!

17:23.150 --> 17:25.790
Ha-ha. Oh, Twilight.

17:25.790 --> 17:28.730
Did those silly fillies finally get into your head?

17:28.730 --> 17:31.110
You know there's no such thing as a curse.

17:31.110 --> 17:35.760
Applebloom, sweetie, you can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse.

17:35.950 --> 17:37.740
This isn't a curse.

17:37.740 --> 17:39.560
If you will remember back.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.280
The words I spoke were quite exact.

17:42.650 --> 17:45.930
Beware! Beware, you ponyfolk.

17:45.930 --> 17:49.160
Those leaves of blue are not a joke.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.060
It was a warning.

17:51.060 --> 17:52.660
About that blue plant.

17:52.660 --> 17:54.670
It's called "poison joke".

17:54.900 --> 17:57.460
That plant is much like poison oak.

17:57.460 --> 18:00.140
But it's results are like a joke.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.600
What in a hay does that mean?

18:02.790 --> 18:05.620
It means this plant does not breed wrath,

18:05.620 --> 18:08.780
Instead this plant just wants a laugh.

18:09.490 --> 18:12.240
Will somepony please talk normal.

18:12.240 --> 18:18.490
I think what she's saying is that when we ran into save Appleboom, we ran into the "poison joke".

18:18.490 --> 18:21.810
All our problems are just little jokes it played on us.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.260
Little jokes?!

18:23.260 --> 18:24.560
Very funny.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.760
Okay, fine. But what about the cauldron?

18:27.760 --> 18:29.360
And the chanting?

18:29.360 --> 18:30.850
And the creepy decor?

18:31.520 --> 18:34.570
Treasures of the native land where I am from.

18:34.570 --> 18:36.700
This one speaks "hello",

18:36.700 --> 18:38.820
and this "welcome".

18:38.820 --> 18:41.680
Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.510
The words I chanted were from olden times.

18:44.510 --> 18:46.890
Something you call a nursery rhyme.

18:47.190 --> 18:50.950
But the cauldron? The Applebloom soup?

18:50.950 --> 18:54.380
Looky here, Twilight. That part of water was not for me.

18:54.380 --> 18:56.500
It was for all these herbal ingredients.

18:56.500 --> 19:00.030
The cure for "poison joke" is a simple all-natural remedy.

19:00.030 --> 19:02.420
You just got to take a bubble bath.

19:02.420 --> 19:06.430
But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything.

19:06.430 --> 19:08.930
What book has this natural remedy?

19:08.930 --> 19:11.460
Here is the book, you see?

19:11.460 --> 19:14.400
Sad that you lack it in your library.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.560
Actually, I do have this book.

19:17.560 --> 19:22.140
But I did not look inside because the title was so... weird.

19:22.140 --> 19:27.060
Supernaturals. Natural remedies and cure-alls that are simply super.

19:27.540 --> 19:30.930
I... I... I'm so sorry Zecora.

19:30.930 --> 19:35.470
I had the answer the whole time, if only I bother to look inside...

19:35.470 --> 19:39.410
Ha-ha-ha. Maybe next time you will take a second look,

19:39.410 --> 19:42.240
and not judge the cover of the book.

19:43.470 --> 19:47.680
Zecora, would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath?

19:47.680 --> 19:50.130
Mix it up I certainly will.

19:50.130 --> 19:53.630
Yet I'm missing an herb from Ponyvile.

19:53.630 --> 19:58.280
Whenever Zecora comes to town all the shops are mysteriously closed.

19:58.690 --> 20:01.970
Oh, well, I think we can help you with that.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.810
Look, Rose! How awful!

20:07.810 --> 20:10.530
The wicked Enchantress has cursed them all!

20:11.050 --> 20:13.620
The horror! The horror!

20:18.160 --> 20:19.280
Run, ponies! Run!

20:23.110 --> 20:25.190
Daisy, we need to talk.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.540
Dear princess Celestia,

20:28.540 --> 20:32.010
My friends and I all learned an important lesson this week.

20:32.010 --> 20:33.940
Never judge the book by it's cover.

20:33.940 --> 20:40.570
Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary, but you have to look past that and learn what they are inside.

20:40.570 --> 20:45.480
Real friends don't care what your cover is, it's the contents of a pony that count.

20:45.480 --> 20:49.570
And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever.

20:49.570 --> 20:52.510
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.

20:52.510 --> 20:56.310
Miss Zecora, I would love to get a receipt for this bath.

20:56.310 --> 20:58.660
It simply luxurious.

20:59.070 --> 21:02.380
Applejack! Hey! Where is Applejack?

21:04.720 --> 21:07.290
I'm right here, LITTLE sis.

21:07.290 --> 21:09.150
I ain't tiny no more!

21:09.150 --> 21:14.550
Oh... I have never felt so lovely in all my life!

21:14.550 --> 21:17.680
Oh my gosh! I never realized how horrible is not to be able to talk!

21:17.680 --> 21:20.800
I mean I love talking so much but I can't
talk anymore when my tongue was all *bleh*

21:20.800 --> 21:23.930
It was the worst, don't you agree, Fluttershy?

21:25.310 --> 21:26.350
Yes.

21:27.305 --> 21:33.784
