00:23.600 --> 00:27.518
<i>It was good...</i>

00:28.105 --> 00:30.418
<i>... that you called us.</i>

00:31.459 --> 00:34.448
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

00:36.197 --> 00:38.146
<i>We were at the bar...</i>

00:39.585 --> 00:44.810
<i>... drinking, having fun...</i>

00:45.230 --> 00:51.076
<i>I don't even know how I got here.</i>

00:52.094 --> 00:54.840
Come on, she's been under too long.

00:54.995 --> 00:58.426
<i>You're the only one who can help me.</i>

01:03.477 --> 01:06.050
<i>Come on, come on...</i>

01:06.331 --> 01:12.419
<i>- Tell me what I need to know.</i>
<i>- They'll kill me.</i>

01:15.197 --> 01:17.136
<i>You asked for my help.</i>

01:18.929 --> 01:20.501
<i>Come on.</i>

01:24.818 --> 01:26.456
<i>The contact in Minsk...</i>

01:26.832 --> 01:29.290
Give us the name.

01:30.686 --> 01:34.781
Dimitri... Miediev.

01:49.062 --> 01:53.733
<i>- What now?</i>
<i>- Now we drink.</i>

01:54.132 --> 01:55.860
<i>To friends.</i>

02:16.251 --> 02:18.199
Get rid of that scum.

02:57.390 --> 03:00.886
- Did we get it?
- We got it.

03:56.769 --> 03:59.692
Would you like
to watch a movie, Mr Rosen?

04:05.416 --> 04:10.187
- Care to watch a movie, Mr Phelps?
- No, I prefer the theatre.

04:10.674 --> 04:13.729
Would you consider
the cinema of the Ukraine?

04:15.344 --> 04:17.183
Perhaps you'd choose one for me.

04:21.767 --> 04:24.009
Thank you.

04:47.981 --> 04:52.712
<i>Good morning, Mr Phelps.</i>
<i>This is Alexander Golitsyn, -</i>

04:52.926 --> 04:57.837
<i>- an attachÃ© at our embassy</i>
<i>in Prague. He is also a traitor.</i>

04:58.056 --> 05:01.390
<i>He has stolen one half</i>
<i>of a CIA NOC list-</i>

05:01.602 --> 05:04.888
<i>- of all our deep cover agents</i>
<i>in Eastern Europe.</i>

05:05.106 --> 05:09.566
<i>For security reasons,</i>
<i>the NOC list is divided in two.</i>

05:09.777 --> 05:13.147
<i>The portion Golitsyn has</i>
<i>contains code names.</i>

05:13.365 --> 05:18.786
<i>It is useless without its mate, which</i>
<i>matches the codes with true names.</i>

05:18.996 --> 05:25.330
<i>It is this half Golitsyn plans to steal</i>
<i>at an embassy reception tomorrow.</i>

05:25.544 --> 05:30.705
<i>Your mission, should you choose to</i>
<i>accept it, is to obtain proof of the theft.</i>

05:30.925 --> 05:35.552
<i>Shadow Golitsyn to his buyer</i>
<i>and apprehend them both.</i>

05:35.763 --> 05:39.632
<i>I've dispatched a team</i>
<i>selected from your group.</i>

05:39.852 --> 05:44.893
<i>Sarah Davies is undercover now. Jack</i>
<i>Harmon can hack into their system.</i>

05:45.107 --> 05:50.102
<i>Hannah Williams will do surveillance.</i>
<i>Your wife, Claire, will cover transport.</i>

05:50.321 --> 05:54.366
<i>And Ethan Hunt</i>
<i>will be your point man, as usual.</i>

05:54.576 --> 05:58.905
<i>He is now in Kiev and</i>
<i>will rendezvous with you in Prague.</i>

05:59.122 --> 06:03.618
<i>Should any member of your IM force</i>
<i>be caught or killed, -</i>

06:03.835 --> 06:07.834
<i>- the Secretary will disavow</i>
<i>all knowledge of your actions.</i>

06:08.049 --> 06:12.592
<i>This tape will self-destruct</i>
<i>in five seconds. Good luck, Jim.</i>

06:34.285 --> 06:37.619
A very straightforward objective.

06:37.830 --> 06:42.327
We photograph Golitsyn stealing the
NOC list, follow him to his buyer, -

06:42.543 --> 06:47.669
- apprehend both of them.
Now, here's the plot. Ethan...

06:47.883 --> 06:53.126
You go into the embassy in character,
during a party. Hide in plain sight.

06:53.347 --> 06:56.680
- You game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

06:56.892 --> 07:02.184
Sarah, you're there as the embassy's
Washington visitors' liaison.

07:02.399 --> 07:05.316
You and Ethan will run the game.

07:05.527 --> 07:11.151
- I haven't a thing to wear.
- Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

07:12.827 --> 07:19.992
Mark Golitsyn and hand him off
to Hannah. Hannah, you stay on him.

07:20.209 --> 07:25.501
Jack, fingerprint security is accessed
through the elevator shaft here.

07:25.716 --> 07:32.085
- So I guess I'm not wearing my tux.
- Open, close, get out.

07:32.305 --> 07:35.591
Claire, you're in the vehicle.

07:35.809 --> 07:41.480
Hannah will join you as Golitsyn
goes exterior. You two stay on him.

07:41.691 --> 07:45.475
If I call "abort",
everybody walk away immediately.

07:45.778 --> 07:49.823
Regroup here at 4:00 a.m.

07:50.033 --> 07:53.403
Any questions?

07:53.620 --> 07:59.042
Can we get a cappuccino machine?
I don't know what you call this.

07:59.251 --> 08:03.713
- I call it cruel and unusual.
- I made that coffee.

08:03.923 --> 08:08.170
Is it possible that it's worse
than the sludge you made in Kiev?

08:08.386 --> 08:14.471
- Hey, take it easy on my wife's coffee.
- We missed you in Kiev, Jim.

08:14.684 --> 08:19.228
- Off on a cushy recruiting assignment?
- Did they put you at the Plaza?

08:19.440 --> 08:22.227
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

08:22.443 --> 08:27.235
- Punishing! 24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.

08:27.448 --> 08:30.236
He's getting soft in his old age.

08:30.452 --> 08:34.746
Okay, listen. If that list
gets out into the open, -

08:34.956 --> 08:39.914
- the names of our agents will be
up for grabs to the highest bidders.

08:40.128 --> 08:47.461
Terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords.
Everyone who wants to get rid of us.

08:47.679 --> 08:51.463
If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

08:53.976 --> 08:59.185
I'll run the whole show from here.
Let's punch out the details.

08:59.400 --> 09:05.901
There's a camera built into the bridge.
It transmits what you see back here.

09:07.950 --> 09:13.372
Can you hear me?
No, you need an earpiece.

09:18.211 --> 09:21.995
You have lovely eyes...
Can you hear me now?

09:22.215 --> 09:27.376
If he has a car waiting, and he rolls,
stay with him no matter what.

09:27.596 --> 09:34.477
- You should check out these streets.
- What do you think I've been doing?

09:34.687 --> 09:38.271
- We're using Waltzer?
- He's our guy.

09:38.483 --> 09:43.644
- Isn't he chairing a hearing?
- Not this week.

09:43.864 --> 09:49.950
This week he's fly-fishing in County
Kildare with one of our Irish guides.

09:50.163 --> 09:54.077
And he won't be back anytime soon.

09:57.795 --> 10:02.174
<i>Senator, it sounds as if</i>
<i>you want to lead the kind of charge -</i>

10:02.384 --> 10:09.799
<i>- that Sen. Church led in the 70's, and</i>
<i>destroy the US's intelligence capability.</i>

10:10.017 --> 10:14.809
<i>I want to know who they are and how</i>
<i>they're spending the taxpayers'money.</i>

10:15.022 --> 10:18.606
<i>This is still a democracy.</i>

10:19.861 --> 10:25.484
Stick of gum, right?
No. Red light, green light.

10:25.700 --> 10:30.696
You have a lock you can't pick,
you mash them together...

10:30.915 --> 10:36.075
<i>Hasta</i> lasagne, don't get any on ya'.
You'll have about five seconds.

10:38.297 --> 10:41.049
Just don't chew it.

11:18.298 --> 11:22.131
Ethan, Jack's inside.
Let's go.

11:27.100 --> 11:31.263
<i>How do you do, Senator?</i>
<i>How was the opera?</i>

11:33.106 --> 11:37.436
- It was boring.
- Let me see if I can steer you through.

11:50.167 --> 11:55.327
- Windows open by 2300.
- Mr Brandl, the mayor, and Mrs Brandl.

11:55.547 --> 12:00.506
Senator,
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

12:00.720 --> 12:05.927
- Of course. How are you, Ms Norman?
- He's in pocket, on the stairway.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.766
Mr Golitsyn, nice to see you.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.025
Hannah.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.574
<i>Pull the shade.</i>

12:30.835 --> 12:35.213
<i>Sarah, mark the package</i>
<i>and go to two.</i>

12:38.802 --> 12:45.849
Your advance team said you'd like
a tour of the facility. This way.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.939
Oh, great.

12:59.157 --> 13:05.112
...which leads to the Denied Area,
the only limited access area here.

13:29.773 --> 13:33.024
Governor's in position now.

13:41.244 --> 13:47.497
- Can I help you?
- As you can see, there's surveillance.

13:47.710 --> 13:51.624
I'm sorry,
I know it's in here somewhere.

13:51.839 --> 13:54.875
Sergeant, why are you not in uniform?

13:55.092 --> 13:58.877
<i>We've been ordered</i>
<i>to wear civilian clothes, sir.</i>

14:01.558 --> 14:04.345
Be right back.

14:04.561 --> 14:11.560
- Do you have a Jack on your staff?
<i>- I believe we did.</i>

14:11.778 --> 14:17.116
An unreliable fellow, as I recall.
Constantly late and behind in his work.

14:19.994 --> 14:26.247
<i>We were forced to tie him to a horse</i>
<i>and drag him around my barn.</i>

14:26.585 --> 14:28.661
I'm working on it.

14:42.227 --> 14:46.355
Sorry.
Thank you. Have a nice evening.

14:58.369 --> 15:01.536
That date with Sarah is definitely off.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.106
Higher.

15:37.119 --> 15:39.491
He's heading to the Denied Area.

15:42.291 --> 15:46.159
Get moving, Ethan. He's rolling to you.

15:55.472 --> 15:58.224
Jack...

15:59.352 --> 16:02.970
Jack, we're in position here.

16:03.189 --> 16:05.680
I didn't touch it.

16:07.401 --> 16:12.693
- What about my coat? I'll freeze.
- Jack, open the doors.

16:20.665 --> 16:24.201
He's in the box, Ethan.

16:24.420 --> 16:28.418
- We'll take his exit. Open these doors.
- I don't have it.

16:29.801 --> 16:32.837
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

17:14.973 --> 17:18.473
- He's got it.
- All right.

17:18.686 --> 17:23.313
- I saved your ass again, Jack.
- Such a nice ass.

17:23.525 --> 17:27.522
- And a lonely ass.
- Transport in five minutes.

18:12.244 --> 18:17.535
Jack, we're in position. Open the doors
and let the package roll.

18:18.959 --> 18:23.041
Stairway, you're wrapped.
Go to transport.

18:31.807 --> 18:35.093
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

18:40.274 --> 18:44.983
I don't have control, Jack.
Cut the power.

18:47.908 --> 18:51.609
- Cut the power.
- Come on, Jack.

19:01.589 --> 19:03.582
Jack...

19:05.427 --> 19:09.341
Jack...
Jack?

19:10.932 --> 19:14.883
<i>- Jack, do you copy?</i>
- Man down, Ethan.

19:15.104 --> 19:17.773
<i>Man down.</i>

19:36.918 --> 19:41.297
Ethan, stay where you are.
I'm coming to you.

19:56.148 --> 19:59.731
The package is out in the open.

20:02.196 --> 20:06.574
- Jim, he's in the open.
- En route.

20:27.014 --> 20:29.588
Jim, he's in the open.

20:30.601 --> 20:34.053
Jim, the package is in the open.

20:36.942 --> 20:41.604
I've got a shadow.
I can't lose him. Abort!

20:41.822 --> 20:45.273
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

20:48.579 --> 20:52.529
- I can't do that.
- We're being ambushed. Abort!

20:52.750 --> 20:58.124
- Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.
<i>- No, dammit, I said abort!</i>

21:08.142 --> 21:12.306
- Eye on the package. Jim, I'm coming.
- Jim gave an abort.

21:12.522 --> 21:18.395
We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me? Now go!

21:50.479 --> 21:54.228
- Where are you?
- 200 yards from the bridge.

21:54.442 --> 21:57.063
<i>They're covering the frequency.</i>

21:57.278 --> 22:01.145
<i>Cut all radio communication.</i>

22:25.809 --> 22:28.382
<i>Ethan...</i>

22:59.721 --> 23:04.217
Sarah, abort.
Repeat: Abort!

23:07.228 --> 23:10.063
Abort! Do you read me?

23:14.486 --> 23:16.858
Sarah...

23:48.731 --> 23:52.267
Oh my God!

25:40.310 --> 25:44.142
<i>- Satcom 7.</i>
- Central Europe, unsecured.

25:44.355 --> 25:48.603
<i>- Designator?</i>
- Bravo, echo, one, one.

25:50.821 --> 25:55.448
<i>- This is Kittridge.</i>
- Go secure.

25:56.911 --> 26:00.908
This is Ethan Hunt. They're dead.

26:01.123 --> 26:05.620
<i>- Who's dead?</i>
- My team. My team is dead!

26:05.837 --> 26:12.089
Golitsyn's gone. They knew
we were coming. The disk is gone.

26:12.302 --> 26:17.546
<i>- Are you intact?</i>
- The list is in the open!

26:17.767 --> 26:23.058
<i>Letâ€™s just bring you in safely,</i>
<i>then we'll worry about that.</i>

26:23.272 --> 26:28.434
<i>- Were you followed?</i>
- I don't think so.

26:28.654 --> 26:31.820
<i>Don't think. Be sure.</i>
<i>Are you clean?</i>

26:32.032 --> 26:34.108
Yes.

26:34.326 --> 26:39.071
<i>Location Green, one hour.</i>
<i>I'll be there myself.</i>

26:39.289 --> 26:42.291
- You're in Prague?
<i>- One hour.</i>

27:37.728 --> 27:43.564
I... I can't tell you how sorry I am.

27:43.776 --> 27:48.688
I know how much Jim,
in particular, meant to you.

27:48.907 --> 27:54.363
- Personally as well as professionally.
- Yeah...

27:58.416 --> 28:02.664
Here's a passport and visa. Usual drill.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.964
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada -

28:06.175 --> 28:10.255
- and throw the Prague police a bone,
toss them a few suspects.

28:14.935 --> 28:20.605
- You follow me?
- Yeah, I follow you.

28:21.817 --> 28:27.607
- We've lost enough agents for tonight.
- You mean, <i>I have.</i>

28:29.367 --> 28:34.954
- You're bent on blaming yourself.
- Who else is left?

28:36.874 --> 28:40.410
Yeah, I see your point.

28:45.342 --> 28:48.793
- Why was there another team?
- What?

28:50.639 --> 28:53.345
The IMF agents at the embassy.

28:55.228 --> 28:58.727
I don't quite follow you.

29:00.358 --> 29:03.193
Then follow me around the room.

29:03.403 --> 29:08.232
The drunk Russians on
the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock.

29:09.285 --> 29:15.786
The couple waltzing around me,
the waiter standing behind Hannah.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.663
Bow tie at 12 o'clock.
The other IMF team.

29:20.881 --> 29:23.835
You're worried about me. Why?

29:26.178 --> 29:30.555
For two years
we've been spotting a blowback -

29:30.766 --> 29:34.301
- in IMF operations.
We have a penetration.

29:34.520 --> 29:39.645
We've decoded an Internet message
from a Czech we know as "Max".

29:39.859 --> 29:43.109
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

29:43.321 --> 29:50.867
Max has a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

29:51.080 --> 29:57.533
This time he got on the inside,
in a position to buy our NOC list.

29:57.753 --> 30:03.792
An operation he called "Job 3-14". He
thought Golitsyn was doing it tonight.

30:06.679 --> 30:11.722
- The list he stole was a decoy.
- That's correct.

30:11.936 --> 30:16.645
The actual list is secure at Langley.
Golitsyn was one of ours.

30:19.110 --> 30:24.104
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

30:29.246 --> 30:33.658
- The whole operation was a mole hunt.
- Yeah.

30:35.669 --> 30:39.370
The mole's deep inside.

30:40.425 --> 30:45.300
And like you said...

30:45.513 --> 30:48.218
...you survived.

30:50.184 --> 30:52.807
I want to show you something.

30:54.898 --> 30:59.856
Since your father's death, your
family's farm has been in receivership.

31:00.070 --> 31:04.021
Suddenly, they have 120 grand
in the bank.

31:04.242 --> 31:08.026
The illness was supposed to have
wiped out that account.

31:08.246 --> 31:13.916
Dying slowly in America can be
a very expensive proposition.

31:15.837 --> 31:22.090
So why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

31:25.014 --> 31:29.889
- I can understand you're very upset.
- You've never seen me very upset.

31:30.103 --> 31:32.559
Enough is enough.

31:32.773 --> 31:37.399
You've bribed and killed,
using loyalties on the inside.

31:37.611 --> 31:42.356
You want to shake hands with the
devil? Fine, but you'll do it in hell.

33:42.913 --> 33:46.329
Money, money...
Where's the damn money?

34:12.735 --> 34:18.905
<i>We've decoded an Internet message</i>
<i>from a Czech we know as "Max".</i>

34:19.118 --> 34:25.038
<i>He got in a position to buy our NOC</i>
<i>list. An operation he called "Job 3-14".</i>

35:21.226 --> 35:24.975
Job 3:14...

35:39.037 --> 35:43.581
"...asleep and at rest with kings
and counsellors of the earth..."

35:45.795 --> 35:49.128
You son of a bitch.

37:27.571 --> 37:30.904
Ethan...

37:31.116 --> 37:36.573
What are you doing?
I needed you.

37:36.789 --> 37:39.993
On the bridge.

37:40.210 --> 37:43.579
But you weren't there.

37:58.312 --> 38:03.057
- Don't move.
- Ethan...

38:03.275 --> 38:07.819
It's okay. Just calm down.
It's Claire.

38:09.699 --> 38:13.400
- You were in the car.
- No, I wasn't.

38:15.455 --> 38:20.795
- I heard on the radio...
- I saw you, you were in the car.

38:21.003 --> 38:26.294
No, I got out of the car. I ran to
the bridge. He said someone was...

38:26.509 --> 38:31.006
Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.
There was nobody there.

38:31.223 --> 38:36.977
- What happened to Jim?
- Wake up! Jim's dead! They're all dead!

38:45.029 --> 38:48.897
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead...

38:51.327 --> 38:54.946
Take off your coat.

39:08.637 --> 39:13.135
I walked away. He said abort.
I just walked away.

39:13.351 --> 39:20.101
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you? Did they send you?

39:20.317 --> 39:23.936
No one sent me.

39:24.155 --> 39:29.861
We were supposed to be back here
at four o'clock if we abort.

39:30.077 --> 39:34.704
0400. Four a.m. Four o'clock.
It's four o'clock.

39:34.916 --> 39:38.866
If we abort... four a.m.

39:58.733 --> 40:01.936
I've been disavowed.

40:06.700 --> 40:11.777
They actually think
I killed Jim and everyone else.

40:16.294 --> 40:20.624
Somehow, $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.

40:20.841 --> 40:26.380
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole,
employed by an arms dealer, Max, -

40:26.596 --> 40:31.058
- for the last two years,
to get him our NOC list.

40:32.895 --> 40:38.056
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get it for him.

40:38.276 --> 40:42.571
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

40:42.781 --> 40:47.443
Whoever the mole is,
he goes by the name of Job.

40:47.661 --> 40:52.904
I can't find him, but if he knows
I have the NOC list, he'll find me.

40:53.125 --> 40:58.167
I'm going to go in and tell Kittridge
you have nothing to do with this.

40:58.381 --> 41:04.336
Claire, if you're not dead,
he'll assume you're with me.

41:19.862 --> 41:23.196
The message is for Job.

41:23.408 --> 41:26.907
That's right.
And I'm going to answer it.

41:50.562 --> 41:55.271
Excuse me,
could I trouble you for a match?

42:11.543 --> 42:14.829
Remove your hat, please.

42:17.091 --> 42:20.376
- Why?
- You wish to meet Max?

42:20.594 --> 42:23.797
The price of admission.

42:33.233 --> 42:39.069
- I thought I was going to see Max.
- You misunderstood. No one sees Max.

42:39.281 --> 42:45.652
- Then why the hell am I here?
- So he can hear what you have to say.

42:45.872 --> 42:49.490
I don't communicate well
through a shroud.

42:49.709 --> 42:55.665
If Max doesn't like what you say,
you'll be wearing it indefinitely.

42:57.176 --> 43:00.758
I'm willing to take the chance.

43:04.725 --> 43:07.217
Very well.

43:10.315 --> 43:14.775
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

43:14.986 --> 43:18.272
I need $150,000.

43:19.909 --> 43:22.150
Really?

43:24.788 --> 43:30.412
And you thought if you simply
showed up, I might give it to you?

43:30.628 --> 43:34.377
Why not? You gave Job 125.

43:36.510 --> 43:41.337
The penny drops. You are not Job.

43:43.266 --> 43:48.178
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

43:48.397 --> 43:54.483
Its tone was aggressive but playful.
Job is not playful.

43:56.072 --> 44:01.529
- So you are something of a paradox.
- Well, that depends.

44:01.745 --> 44:05.659
- On what?
- Whether you like a paradox.

44:07.543 --> 44:13.249
- I want $150,000 today.
- That's quite out of the question.

44:15.468 --> 44:19.217
The disk Job sold you is worthless.

44:19.430 --> 44:23.642
It's bait. Part of an internal mole hunt.

44:27.982 --> 44:31.931
And how might you know that?

44:32.153 --> 44:36.067
Are you another company man?

44:36.282 --> 44:39.782
Like Job?

44:41.705 --> 44:45.572
We're asking about you.

44:45.792 --> 44:50.501
I'm NOC. Was...
Now disavowed.

44:51.674 --> 44:56.502
- Why, may I ask?
- That's what I want to ask Job.

44:56.721 --> 45:01.963
I don't know Job
any more than Job knows me.

45:02.185 --> 45:06.017
You could arrange an introduction.

45:06.231 --> 45:10.727
- Why should I?
- I can deliver the actual NOC list.

45:10.944 --> 45:17.113
Your list is worthless, and it's probably
equipped with a homing device.

45:21.122 --> 45:27.374
Boot it up. In 10 minutes you'll have the
CIA hopping around you like rabbits.

45:31.342 --> 45:37.462
It's easy to say it's worthless if I can't
look at it to see if it's worthless.

45:37.681 --> 45:43.186
- Not a tenable position, sir.
- Okay, use it.

45:43.395 --> 45:47.893
But I'd suggest you pack first.

46:02.959 --> 46:08.166
- 26-27. So far, so good.
- Not so good for you, my friend.

46:08.381 --> 46:12.296
I'd say you've got about two minutes.

46:42.918 --> 46:48.126
- 32 and 33.
- Doesn't mean it's a signal.

46:55.640 --> 46:59.341
44 and 45.

47:46.028 --> 47:51.319
The man's gone black, Barnes.
He's under until he decides to surface.

47:51.534 --> 47:57.952
- We can cut off his transportation.
- What can we do, Barnes?

47:58.166 --> 48:02.294
Put a guy at the airport?
How many identities does Hunt have?

48:02.504 --> 48:06.632
How many times
has he slipped past customs?

48:06.842 --> 48:11.670
These guys are trained to be ghosts.
We taught them!

48:11.889 --> 48:15.258
What do you suggest?

48:15.476 --> 48:19.094
Let's make him come to us.

48:19.313 --> 48:25.851
You find something that's personally
important to him and you squeeze.

48:31.118 --> 48:35.496
GÃ¼nther will never let me
have one of his apartments again.

48:36.624 --> 48:41.998
- Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
- Thanks, Max.

48:43.256 --> 48:46.423
Or is it Maxine?

48:46.634 --> 48:50.929
I don't have to tell you what a comfort
anonymity is in my profession.

48:52.224 --> 48:55.558
It's like a warm blanket.

48:58.689 --> 49:04.147
My deal with Job was subject to
a successful boot scan. The deal's off.

49:06.239 --> 49:10.403
- What was your deal with Job?
- Six million dollars.

49:10.619 --> 49:15.531
I'll give you the same, for the
complete list, not just Eastern Europe.

49:15.750 --> 49:19.700
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

49:19.921 --> 49:27.003
10 million, in negotiable US Treasury
certificates, coupons attached.

49:27.220 --> 49:30.138
And one more thing...

49:30.349 --> 49:35.343
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

49:51.579 --> 49:58.497
- Max made a deal with you?
- I deliver the list, Max delivers Job.

50:00.589 --> 50:05.085
We've 75 rounds for the Beretta,
but only 20 for the Sig-Sauer.

50:05.302 --> 50:09.218
One pair of Visco glasses.

50:09.432 --> 50:12.350
Plenty of passports...

50:15.897 --> 50:22.435
Well, you said it yourself.
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

50:24.073 --> 50:27.822
- Are you sure?
- Jim was my husband.

50:28.035 --> 50:32.744
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

50:32.957 --> 50:38.996
- We need help. They'll have to be local.
- What kind of help?

51:13.376 --> 51:17.919
Simple game. Four players.

51:18.131 --> 51:22.544
Exfil opens the pocket,
cyber ops lifts the wallet.

51:22.761 --> 51:27.091
- Bank?
- IMF mainframe.

51:27.308 --> 51:31.934
- Where exactly is it?
- In Langley.

51:33.773 --> 51:37.723
In Langley?
The one in Virginia?

51:39.279 --> 51:42.814
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

51:43.033 --> 51:46.532
- Is he serious?
- Always.

51:48.872 --> 51:52.705
Why don't we drop by Fort Knox?

51:52.919 --> 51:57.166
I can fly a helicopter into the vault.

51:57.382 --> 52:01.296
It would be easier
than breaking into the CIA.

52:01.511 --> 52:06.506
- What kind of information is it?
- Profitable.

52:08.227 --> 52:11.311
Payment on delivery.

52:12.273 --> 52:16.566
I don't know.
I just don't know.

52:18.028 --> 52:22.359
This doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

52:22.576 --> 52:27.072
What did they used to call you?
The Net Ranger?

52:27.289 --> 52:30.206
The only man to hack NATO Ghostcom.

52:30.417 --> 52:35.958
There was never any evidence
that I had anything to do with that...

52:36.173 --> 52:39.625
...with that exceptional piece of work.

52:43.306 --> 52:48.811
You don't know what you're missing.
This is the Mt Everest of hacks.

52:49.021 --> 52:55.640
You're kidding yourselves. Even with
top of the line crypto, Stu 3's...

52:55.861 --> 53:00.987
- Krieger can get it. Right?
- It may take a little time.

53:01.201 --> 53:04.901
That's not what Claire says about you.

53:05.121 --> 53:09.249
Thinking Machine laptops.

53:09.459 --> 53:14.916
The 686 prototypes,
with the artificial intelligence Risc chip.

53:15.132 --> 53:17.919
24 hours.

53:18.135 --> 53:22.596
And I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

53:22.806 --> 53:27.802
Luther,
I guess you're all out of excuses.

53:30.649 --> 53:34.598
Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

53:34.819 --> 53:40.989
No modem access to a mainframe.
It's in what we call a "stand-alone".

53:41.202 --> 53:46.706
Which means I'd have to be
physically at the terminal.

53:46.916 --> 53:50.784
Relax, it's much worse than you think.

53:51.004 --> 53:53.791
It's in a black vault lock-down.

53:54.007 --> 54:00.461
<i>The only person allowed in the room</i>
<i>has to pass through security checks.</i>

54:00.681 --> 54:06.138
<i>The first is a voiceprint identification</i>
<i>and a six-digit access code.</i>

54:08.731 --> 54:12.314
<i>This only gets him into the outer room.</i>

54:12.527 --> 54:16.275
<i>Next he has to pass a retinal scan.</i>

54:18.200 --> 54:24.488
<i>And the intrusion countermeasures are</i>
<i>deactivated by an electronic key card.</i>

54:24.707 --> 54:28.241
Which we won't have.

54:28.460 --> 54:35.627
<i>Inside the black vault, three systems</i>
<i>operate whenever the technician is out.</i>

54:35.844 --> 54:41.929
<i>The first is sound sensitive.</i>
<i>Anything above a whisper sets it off.</i>

54:42.142 --> 54:45.428
<i>The second system detects</i>
<i>any increase in temperature.</i>

54:45.646 --> 54:52.016
<i>The body heat of an intruder will trigger</i>
<i>it if the temperature rises one degree.</i>

54:56.825 --> 55:01.321
<i>That temperature is controlled</i>
<i>by the air conditioning duct, -</i>

55:01.538 --> 55:04.990
<i>- 30 feet above the floor.</i>

55:05.209 --> 55:08.126
<i>That vent is guarded by a laser net.</i>

55:11.341 --> 55:16.086
<i>The third system is on the floor</i>
<i>and is pressure sensitive.</i>

55:16.304 --> 55:20.633
<i>The slightest increase in weight</i>
<i>will trigger the alarm.</i>

55:20.850 --> 55:26.889
<i>If any one of these systems is set off,</i>
<i>it will activate an automatic lock-down.</i>

55:27.107 --> 55:33.146
<i>Believe me when I tell you,</i>
<i>all three systems are state of the art.</i>

55:37.702 --> 55:40.906
And you really think we can do this?

55:42.249 --> 55:44.288
We're going to do it.

56:17.996 --> 56:20.747
Alarms in sectors 3, 7 and 12.

56:20.957 --> 56:25.833
<i>- What sector's the air conditioning?</i>
<i>- 21. But there's no alarm in 21.</i>

56:32.469 --> 56:38.056
<i>No one goes into any sector where the</i>
<i>alarm hasn't gone off, and it hasn't...</i>

56:42.480 --> 56:46.478
<i>- It's gone off. Let's go.</i>
- Let's move.

56:57.580 --> 57:01.447
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

57:03.294 --> 57:06.211
21's through here.

57:12.179 --> 57:16.259
- He's recruiting. For what purpose?
- Survival.

57:16.475 --> 57:21.434
Too short-sighted. This guy initiates.
The question is, what does he want?

57:21.648 --> 57:26.440
Where does he need to get it?
Barnes, what the hell is that noise?

57:26.653 --> 57:32.406
- Fire alarm, Gene.
- Do we have to evacuate?

58:20.002 --> 58:22.837
Hey, where's the other guy?

58:26.216 --> 58:29.467
- Zero body count.
- We'll see.

01:00:03.071 --> 01:00:06.321
Hi, there.

01:01:05.221 --> 01:01:09.765
One, two, three.

01:01:09.976 --> 01:01:13.345
Toast, toast.

01:01:13.563 --> 01:01:19.021
<i>- Check.</i>
- Good. Okay, Luther, I'm going in.

01:01:19.237 --> 01:01:24.112
<i>Everest, man.</i>
<i>You ready to plant the flag?</i>

01:01:30.456 --> 01:01:35.796
- Damn.
- Krieger, from now on, total silence.

01:02:52.378 --> 01:02:55.083
He's rolling to you.

01:02:58.009 --> 01:03:01.793
- He's at the voiceprint corridor.
- William Donloe.

01:03:17.739 --> 01:03:19.897
Outer room.

01:03:23.453 --> 01:03:26.620
He's coming in the vault.

01:03:30.628 --> 01:03:33.166
Come on, move.

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:04.018
He's in the bathroom.

01:06:20.102 --> 01:06:22.474
A-W-9 -

01:06:22.688 --> 01:06:25.144
<i>- 6-B-6.</i>

01:06:44.085 --> 01:06:45.996
Holy mother of God.

01:06:46.213 --> 01:06:48.336
<i>A NOC list.</i>

01:09:45.322 --> 01:09:48.656
He's at the vault.

01:10:00.422 --> 01:10:02.165
Four yellows.

01:10:05.177 --> 01:10:08.178
One red.

01:10:17.899 --> 01:10:20.272
Get moving.

01:10:23.322 --> 01:10:25.563
Toast.

01:11:26.139 --> 01:11:28.465
Oh, my God.

01:11:44.242 --> 01:11:48.656
- It's for you.
- Kittridge.

01:12:11.896 --> 01:12:16.061
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops.

01:12:16.277 --> 01:12:19.776
- It never happened.
- What about him?

01:12:19.989 --> 01:12:24.366
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska by the end of the day.

01:13:04.578 --> 01:13:09.621
Are you contacting your buyer?
Ethan?

01:13:23.015 --> 01:13:25.767
Ethan?

01:13:27.144 --> 01:13:30.763
Oh, excuse me. "Mr Hunt".

01:13:39.032 --> 01:13:43.659
You're not going to any meeting
without me.

01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:48.783
My contact is extremely shy.

01:13:49.002 --> 01:13:53.130
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders.

01:13:53.339 --> 01:13:56.673
- Not while I'm holding this.
- Krieger...

01:13:56.884 --> 01:13:59.007
<i>Shut up.</i>

01:14:03.475 --> 01:14:06.975
- You mean this?
- That's not the list.

01:14:07.187 --> 01:14:10.687
You've never seen this trick?

01:14:18.158 --> 01:14:20.862
Where did it go?

01:14:23.913 --> 01:14:26.536
It's gone.

01:14:26.751 --> 01:14:30.333
- What?
- You... no?

01:14:37.345 --> 01:14:39.837
But not too far.

01:14:42.768 --> 01:14:45.555
I know what you're thinking.

01:14:45.771 --> 01:14:51.357
"In the computer room, I was up here
and he was down there."

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:57.529
"He was carrying two disks."

01:15:00.203 --> 01:15:04.450
- It's hard to keep track of these things.
- Where is it?

01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:24.103
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?

01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:29.982
Try any sleight of hand with my money
and I'll cut your throat.

01:15:55.053 --> 01:15:59.432
<i>- On a cushy recruiting assignment?</i>
<i>- Did they put you at the Plaza?</i>

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:03.307
<i>Drake Hotel, Chicago.</i>

01:16:04.272 --> 01:16:07.189
I'm so sorry.

01:16:12.031 --> 01:16:15.696
Krieger was my call.

01:16:20.497 --> 01:16:24.448
I'm sorry, Ethan.

01:16:27.339 --> 01:16:31.087
We did what we had to do.

01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:34.966
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:16.211
Krieger did have the NOC list?

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:30.190
Hold on to it. If you knew what you were
getting into, you wouldn't have done it.

01:17:36.454 --> 01:17:40.119
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

01:17:40.333 --> 01:17:46.704
Exactly. That's your job tomorrow on
the train. Don't let it get out in the open.

01:17:53.347 --> 01:17:58.176
- What is the range of this thing?
- It's hard to tell. I'll have to be close.

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:08.646
<i>The unlikely setting, a farm in the</i>
<i>heartland of America, Wisconsin.</i>

01:18:08.864 --> 01:18:13.361
<i>Here, Federal agents found the brains</i>
<i>behind an international drug ring:</i>

01:18:13.578 --> 01:18:18.738
<i>Margaret Ethan Hunt and her</i>
<i>brother-in-law, Donald Hunt.</i>

01:18:18.958 --> 01:18:24.333
<i>They were arrested this morning</i>
<i>in a major sting operation -</i>

01:18:24.548 --> 01:18:30.302
<i>- designed to expose the</i>
<i>illegal manufacture of the drug "khat".</i>

01:18:30.512 --> 01:18:33.050
<i>- What we have here is a case...</i>
- Kittridge.

01:19:04.216 --> 01:19:06.588
I see you've been out visiting the folks.

01:19:06.802 --> 01:19:10.135
It's Hunt.
What do you need for a pinpoint?

01:19:10.347 --> 01:19:13.383
Been watching a little TV?

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.726
Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.478
- He's in England.
- Get Ml5.

01:19:21.693 --> 01:19:26.271
My first order of business
after you come in -

01:19:26.489 --> 01:19:32.611
- is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped.

01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:35.665
If you come in now, -

01:19:35.874 --> 01:19:40.786
<i>- we can play down</i>
<i>the charges against you, as well.</i>

01:19:41.005 --> 01:19:45.667
- Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
- Certainly, Ethan.

01:19:45.885 --> 01:19:48.174
If you're dealing with someone -

01:19:48.388 --> 01:19:51.508
<i>- who's crushed, stabbed, -</i>

01:19:51.725 --> 01:19:54.476
- shot and detonated -

01:19:54.687 --> 01:19:59.064
<i>- five members of his own IMF team, -</i>

01:19:59.275 --> 01:20:04.566
- how devastated will you make him
by arresting Ma and Uncle Donald?

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:10.368
<i>I don't know, Ethan.</i>
<i>Why don't you tell me?</i>

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:15.541
Lost him.
We needed three more seconds.

01:20:15.751 --> 01:20:19.583
He wanted us to know
he was in London.

01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:36.100
You're a hard man to catch up with.

01:20:42.946 --> 01:20:46.944
The next day I dragged myself
back to the safe house.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:51.454
- I checked our aliases.
- And you picked us up in the States.

01:20:51.665 --> 01:20:54.998
But you'd gone,
and I could check just so many places.

01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:59.706
Some European countries
don't computerise customs records.

01:20:59.923 --> 01:21:03.340
Once you turned up in England,
it was easy.

01:21:03.552 --> 01:21:09.388
- You know I like Liverpool St. Rentals.
- I showed them to you.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.767
I remember.

01:21:12.978 --> 01:21:18.934
A doctor's got to look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

01:21:19.152 --> 01:21:26.448
I can sit up straight. I just can't
sit up straight very well. Sit down.

01:21:28.121 --> 01:21:32.996
Ethan... I saw who shot me.

01:21:33.209 --> 01:21:36.044
I saw the mole.

01:21:36.254 --> 01:21:39.873
- It was Kittridge.
- Kittridge...

01:21:40.092 --> 01:21:42.797
Kittridge, Ethan!

01:21:47.766 --> 01:21:52.393
Kittridge is the mole.
My God. Of course, you're right.

01:21:58.737 --> 01:22:03.399
He was at the embassy that night.

01:22:03.616 --> 01:22:07.947
First he took out Jack, at the elevator.

01:22:15.838 --> 01:22:19.457
He shot you on the bridge.

01:23:02.847 --> 01:23:07.675
He must have had back-up to take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

01:23:24.955 --> 01:23:28.905
How did he do Hannah?

01:23:51.942 --> 01:23:55.643
No, he could've done Hannah himself.

01:24:22.433 --> 01:24:26.680
Why, Jim?
Why?

01:24:29.774 --> 01:24:35.113
When you think about it,
it was inevitable. No more Cold War.

01:24:35.322 --> 01:24:41.490
No more secrets to keep
from everyone but yourself.

01:24:41.703 --> 01:24:48.039
Then suddenly the President is running
the country without your permission.

01:24:48.252 --> 01:24:54.338
The son of a bitch, how dare he?
And you realise it's over.

01:24:54.550 --> 01:25:00.305
You're obsolete hardware, with
a lousy marriage and 62 grand a year.

01:25:02.351 --> 01:25:07.392
Kittridge. We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch, big time.

01:25:12.445 --> 01:25:16.988
We won't have to.
He'll come after us.

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:22.325
- What's going to make him do that?
- What he didn't get in Prague.

01:25:22.539 --> 01:25:25.956
The NOC list.

01:25:26.168 --> 01:25:29.205
Jesus, Ethan.

01:25:29.422 --> 01:25:32.873
Good for you.

01:25:33.843 --> 01:25:41.009
- We meet tomorrow, the TGV to Paris.
- Tight security. No guns. Real plus.

01:25:41.226 --> 01:25:46.102
I deliver the NOC list to Max,
Max delivers Job to me.

01:25:46.314 --> 01:25:51.939
Claire and Luther will be on the train.
Krieger will have a helicopter in Paris.

01:25:55.241 --> 01:25:57.946
Jim?

01:26:05.711 --> 01:26:09.127
I was in a cafe, waiting for you...

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:13.040
...and there she was.

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:18.967
Standing in the rain, alive and beautiful,
thinking I'm dead and gone.

01:26:22.937 --> 01:26:27.979
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me, to keep going.

01:26:32.490 --> 01:26:36.357
She can't know about me. No one can.
Not till this is over.

01:26:36.577 --> 01:26:42.332
- You're probably right.
- There's too much at stake.

01:26:42.542 --> 01:26:47.916
Once we leave the safe house,
you get in there and crash.

01:26:48.131 --> 01:26:52.129
- I'll call from Paris.
- You got it.

01:27:15.119 --> 01:27:18.155
What happened?

01:27:20.457 --> 01:27:24.503
I sent the message to Max.

01:27:26.756 --> 01:27:30.505
We're on for tomorrow.

01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.721
Okay.

01:27:47.988 --> 01:27:50.561
Come here.

01:28:31.284 --> 01:28:34.867
- What's this?
- Incoming for you.

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:38.912
X-ray's clean. Non-explosive.

01:28:49.303 --> 01:28:52.506
Gene.

01:28:55.727 --> 01:29:00.188
How long to the London terminus?
We've got 10 minutes. Move!

01:29:38.898 --> 01:29:42.149
<i>- Give me Max.</i>
- It's him.

01:29:45.864 --> 01:29:50.823
- This was not what we discussed.
<i>- My apologies. It couldn't be helped.</i>

01:29:51.037 --> 01:29:54.370
<i>You'll find the disk under your seat.</i>

01:30:29.453 --> 01:30:36.120
Dear boy, I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

01:30:36.335 --> 01:30:41.840
<i>- Not if you tell me where the money is.</i>
- The mere chance is worth 10 million.

01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:47.969
Baggage car, rack 3,
silver briefcase, combination 3-1-4.

01:30:48.181 --> 01:30:53.686
<i>- What about Job?</i>
- I wouldn't worry, he'll find you.

01:31:11.039 --> 01:31:14.871
- What's the matter?
- It's not transmitting.

01:31:15.085 --> 01:31:20.163
We've got to get this through
before we hit the tunnel.

01:31:32.146 --> 01:31:37.057
- What's the problem?
- "Connection denied."

01:31:37.276 --> 01:31:41.736
- Did you check the batteries?
- I always check the batteries.

01:31:41.947 --> 01:31:45.198
Run it through from the top.

01:31:47.579 --> 01:31:50.995
We don't know what Max looks like.

01:31:51.207 --> 01:31:57.328
If he's got that list, he'll want
to check it. That means laptops.

01:32:08.309 --> 01:32:11.145
Excuse me, sir. Your telephone.

01:32:17.819 --> 01:32:23.158
- Is everything all right?
- It's working.

01:32:34.462 --> 01:32:36.620
He's in the baggage car.

01:32:37.925 --> 01:32:44.639
- Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.
<i>- I'll meet you in the baggage car.</i>

01:33:01.366 --> 01:33:03.443
Barnes.

01:33:40.575 --> 01:33:45.403
Ethan's right behind me.
Listen, Jim...

01:33:45.622 --> 01:33:48.410
Is it such a good idea to kill him?

01:33:52.379 --> 01:33:55.049
Kittridge is here.

01:33:57.886 --> 01:34:01.930
We take the money,
Ethan takes the blame.

01:34:04.392 --> 01:34:07.892
No one else has seen you alive.

01:34:09.106 --> 01:34:11.893
No one will believe him.

01:34:39.138 --> 01:34:44.974
Of course, I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

01:34:47.063 --> 01:34:52.687
- Ethan.
- Yes, Ethan Hunt. You remember him.

01:34:55.864 --> 01:35:00.692
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

01:35:00.911 --> 01:35:05.408
<i>When</i> he knew is a good question.
Mind telling me, Ethan?

01:35:05.625 --> 01:35:08.911
Before or after I showed up in London?

01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:14.709
Before London. After you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

01:35:16.262 --> 01:35:19.428
They stamped it, didn't they?
Damned Gideons.

01:35:20.850 --> 01:35:24.717
Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why?

01:35:24.937 --> 01:35:29.849
Why the masquerade?
Why take the risk?

01:35:30.068 --> 01:35:34.481
You've asked the question...
and you are the answer.

01:35:34.698 --> 01:35:39.739
- I knew about Jim.
- But he didn't know about you.

01:35:39.953 --> 01:35:45.245
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:49.042
But I was confident,
having tasted the goods.

01:35:51.215 --> 01:35:55.510
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife."

01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:02.968
- Let's just get the money and get out.
- Yes, let's get the money.

01:36:03.187 --> 01:36:07.137
Ethan, the money.

01:36:08.651 --> 01:36:12.317
Give her the money.

01:36:13.823 --> 01:36:17.323
You've earned it.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.876
- All 10 million.
- Claire was wrong about one thing.

01:36:28.089 --> 01:36:31.089
Oh, what's that?

01:36:50.405 --> 01:36:53.904
Good morning, Mr Phelps.

01:36:54.117 --> 01:36:57.949
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:03.953
- You son of a bitch.
- It's over, Jim.

01:37:10.134 --> 01:37:13.753
- Don't. Don't, Jim.
- "Don't, Jim"?

01:40:29.348 --> 01:40:35.434
No, he's in the tunnel.
He'll crash into us! Accelerate!

01:42:37.903 --> 01:42:41.653
Red light... green light.

01:43:34.423 --> 01:43:38.373
I think this is what you're looking for.

01:43:43.223 --> 01:43:45.512
Hello, Max.

01:43:45.726 --> 01:43:51.350
My lawyers will have a field day with it.
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict...

01:43:51.566 --> 01:43:55.730
Maybe we'll just leave the courts
out of this one.

01:43:57.614 --> 01:44:02.343
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

01:44:02.564 --> 01:44:07.454
<i>In a freak accident, a helicopter</i>
<i>lost altitude, veered into a tunnel, -</i>

01:44:07.589 --> 01:44:11.498
<i>- and collided with a high-speed train.</i>

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:17.052
<i>The pilot was killed,</i>
<i>but no one on the train was hurt...</i>

01:44:19.971 --> 01:44:23.950
- You call your folks? How do they feel?
- About what?

01:44:24.309 --> 01:44:30.393
The Justice Department apology,
VIP treatment, the whole nine yards.

01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:38.278
My mom didn't know how the DEA
mistook them for drug smugglers.

01:44:41.203 --> 01:44:45.336
- Cheers.
- To you, Luther.

01:44:45.713 --> 01:44:50.249
- And being off the disavowed list.
- Hey, I'm the flavour of the month.

01:44:52.506 --> 01:44:55.122
Why don't you come back with me?

01:44:56.928 --> 01:45:00.795
I just don't know why
I'd be doing it.

01:45:03.309 --> 01:45:09.025
I've got to catch my flight...
How does it feel to be a solid citizen?

01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:17.277
Man, I don't know.
I'm going to miss being disreputable.

01:45:17.491 --> 01:45:22.783
If it makes you feel any better,
I'll always think of you that way.

01:45:33.509 --> 01:45:35.747
Excuse me, Mr Hunt.

01:45:36.929 --> 01:45:39.045
Would you like to watch a movie?

01:45:40.263 --> 01:45:43.553
No, thank you.

01:45:44.248 --> 01:45:47.303
Would you consider the cinema
of the Caribbean?

01:45:49.561 --> 01:45:51.244
Aruba, perhaps.

01:49:55.082 --> 01:49:59.626
