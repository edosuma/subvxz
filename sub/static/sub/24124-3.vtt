WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:08.250 --> 01:10.958
The heffalumps and woozles!

01:10.958 --> 01:13.416
The heffalumps and woozles!

01:13.416 --> 01:17.583
- The heffalumps and woozles!

01:17.583 --> 01:21.708
Beware! Beware!

01:21.708 --> 01:23.750
Beware.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.125
Beware.

01:26.125 --> 01:27.958
Beware.

01:32.708 --> 01:34.083
Pooh!

01:35.583 --> 01:39.458
Oh! The heffalumps
and woozles have got me.

01:43.250 --> 01:45.458
- Yeek!

01:47.083 --> 01:49.875
Morning, Piglet.
Rise and shine.

01:51.583 --> 01:54.000
Pooh and I have come
to take you camping.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.625
Camping?

01:55.625 --> 01:58.625
Yep! The great outdoors
beckons!

02:00.125 --> 02:02.458
Nature is calling.

02:02.458 --> 02:06.125
Pooh, Tigger, I don't know.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.958
My house might miss me.

02:07.958 --> 02:11.208
Oh, come on, Piglet, old pal,
we're gonna have oodles of fun.

02:11.208 --> 02:13.625
- We'll build a campfire.
- And eat honey.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.333
And roast marshy-mallows.

02:15.333 --> 02:16.458
And eat honey.

02:16.458 --> 02:17.958
And bestest of all--

02:17.958 --> 02:19.958
- Eat honey?
- No.

02:19.958 --> 02:22.708
Sleepin' under
the wide-open skies.

02:22.708 --> 02:27.458
But what about
the heffalumps and woozles?

02:27.458 --> 02:29.958
Oh, let them find
their own campsite.

02:29.958 --> 02:31.958
No, I meant--

02:31.958 --> 02:35.000
Well, although I've
never actually met one,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.291
I hear they're very f-f-fierce.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.291
Don't worry about them palookas.

02:40.291 --> 02:42.375
Why, if they showed up,
I'll give 'em the old one-three.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.000
I'll give them the four-seven.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.833
I'll give 'em the eight-two!

02:45.833 --> 02:47.875
Fool around with
my arithmetic, huh?

02:47.875 --> 02:49.000
Whoa!

02:53.708 --> 02:55.291
That's odd.

02:55.291 --> 02:58.375
I thought I brought
more honey than that.

03:01.708 --> 03:04.416
Hey, buddy bear!
I set up your tent!

03:04.416 --> 03:06.166
Now what do I do?

03:06.166 --> 03:09.333
Oh, perhaps if we had
some firewood,

03:09.333 --> 03:10.833
we could light a fire.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.625
It's getting kind of dark.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.625
That's it! Firewood!

03:14.625 --> 03:16.333
Great idea, buddy bear!

03:16.333 --> 03:19.375
Tiggers are experts
at getting firewood.

03:19.375 --> 03:22.000
Uh, where do I look?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.875
Out there in the dark,
spooky w-w-woods.

03:25.875 --> 03:28.583
Firewood in the woods?

03:28.583 --> 03:30.333
That's-- Right you are.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.416
TTFN! Ta-ta for now.

03:38.083 --> 03:40.458
Nope, no firewood here.

03:40.458 --> 03:42.708
No firewood here, either.

03:42.708 --> 03:44.750
Not even any firewood down here.

03:48.583 --> 03:49.958
Hmm.

03:49.958 --> 03:52.875
This whole forest seems
fresh out of firewood.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.125
Whoa!

03:58.875 --> 04:01.875
Topeka! I found it!

04:01.875 --> 04:02.875
Firewood!

04:15.125 --> 04:17.708
I just can't wait

04:17.708 --> 04:20.250
until we reach
our home sweet home.

04:20.250 --> 04:24.708
Oh, and just in time
for a little lick of honey.

04:26.458 --> 04:30.125
Yes, Mama,
there's nothing like honey.

04:30.125 --> 04:34.125
And there's no place like--
Gasp!

04:34.125 --> 04:36.083
Our home!

04:36.083 --> 04:39.875
Someone has stolen our home!

04:43.458 --> 04:47.958
Isn't his wonderful?

04:47.958 --> 04:49.750
Mmm! Delictable!

04:49.750 --> 04:52.291
Anyone feel like going home yet?

04:52.291 --> 04:54.166
Don't be ridiculous, Piglet.

04:54.166 --> 04:56.416
Why, we haven't even told
the ghost stories yet.

04:57.416 --> 05:00.375
Ghost s-s-stories?

05:00.375 --> 05:03.833
Yeah, you're right.
Not scary enough.

05:03.833 --> 05:07.750
I know! How about a heffalumps
and woozles story?

05:07.750 --> 05:12.083
Heffalumps?

05:12.083 --> 05:13.458
Heffa--

05:13.458 --> 05:16.208
Help!

05:16.208 --> 05:18.583
Our house!

05:18.583 --> 05:21.375
Ding-ding-ding-ding!
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

05:21.375 --> 05:23.333
Man the lifeboats!
Women and children first!

05:23.333 --> 05:25.291
Ah-ooga! Ah-ooga!

05:25.291 --> 05:27.958
Dive! Dive!

05:34.458 --> 05:36.583
Uh-huh!
Ooh-hoo!
Hee-hee!

05:36.583 --> 05:38.875
- Piglet, Piglet.
-

05:38.875 --> 05:40.291
Piglet!

05:52.750 --> 05:55.875
Help! Help!

05:55.875 --> 05:59.333
Hey, that no-good heffalump's
taken our firewood.

06:00.625 --> 06:05.000
Piglet: Ooh! Tigger,
where are you?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.375
I'm waiting for you
to come find me.

06:16.583 --> 06:18.250
- Yipes!
- Yipes!

06:24.208 --> 06:28.416
Oh, excuse me,
but I thought you were a woozle.

06:28.416 --> 06:30.625
I'm not a woozle.

06:30.625 --> 06:33.458
I know, lucky for me.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.875
I'm a heffalump.

06:35.875 --> 06:39.708
- A heffalump!
- Please don't yell.

06:39.708 --> 06:43.375
- It scares me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:43.375 --> 06:45.250
Funny.

06:45.250 --> 06:48.416
I didn't know heffalumps
were such very small animals.

06:48.416 --> 06:50.708
I thought they were big
and scary.

06:50.708 --> 06:52.250
Scary?

06:52.250 --> 06:53.875
Nuh-uh.

06:53.875 --> 06:57.083
You know what's really scary?

06:57.083 --> 06:59.583
Being lost.

06:59.583 --> 07:01.583
Oh, d-d-dear.

07:03.291 --> 07:06.416
Pooh: Are you sure this
is going to work, Tigger?

07:06.416 --> 07:08.416
Tigger:
Abso-posi-tutly.

07:08.416 --> 07:10.708
The way to a woozle's firewood
is through his honey.

07:10.708 --> 07:13.416
But we've got to find Piglet.

07:13.416 --> 07:15.000
Don't worry, buddy, bear,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.125
Piglet's probably
home sweet homing it.

07:17.125 --> 07:19.000
We gotta get our firewood back.

07:23.458 --> 07:27.250
Mmm! Something smells yummy!

07:27.250 --> 07:29.166
Uh-oh.

07:29.166 --> 07:31.458
Oh, no.

07:31.458 --> 07:34.125
Oh, no.

07:34.125 --> 07:37.083
It must be honey!

07:37.083 --> 07:40.625
Oh, dear!
Papa's got honey feet!

07:42.625 --> 07:44.583
Oh, no.
Oh, now, come on.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.083
Oh, there it is, Mama.

07:46.083 --> 07:50.083
Stop! Stop, I tell you!

07:50.083 --> 07:52.000
I can't take it anymore!

07:52.000 --> 07:54.458
I can't stand it, I tell you!
I want it!

07:56.166 --> 07:58.625
I love it when honey
plays hard to get.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.208
It worked! It worked!

08:14.458 --> 08:18.958
Oh, my, we've fallen
into a deep, dark pit.

08:18.958 --> 08:20.375
So?

08:20.375 --> 08:22.291
Don't you remember,
Papa dear?

08:22.291 --> 08:24.833
You're allergic
to deep, dark pits.

08:24.833 --> 08:26.833
Oh, yeah.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.291
Unusual weather
we're having, Tigger.

08:33.291 --> 08:35.708
What do you mean,
Pooh boy?

08:35.708 --> 08:39.375
It seems to be raining
heffalumps and woozles.

08:42.625 --> 08:45.166
Can you see our way home,
Piglet?

08:45.166 --> 08:46.875
Uh, no.

08:46.875 --> 08:49.500
Well, what can you see?

08:49.500 --> 08:51.833
Treetops.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.708
Um...

08:53.708 --> 08:58.083
A long way down.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.875
What do we do now, Piglet?

09:01.875 --> 09:04.000
Call for h-h-help?

09:04.000 --> 09:07.291
Help!

09:07.291 --> 09:09.500
No! Gimme!
It's my woodpile!

09:09.500 --> 09:11.250
I saw it first!

09:11.250 --> 09:13.833
That's no woodpile!
That's my house!

09:16.708 --> 09:19.166
- No, it's firewood!
- Oh, no!

09:21.708 --> 09:25.583
- No, you don't!
- Help! Help!

09:25.583 --> 09:27.750
My baby!

09:27.750 --> 09:30.000
Piglet?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.208
Both: Help! Help!

09:32.208 --> 09:34.250
There they are!

09:34.250 --> 09:37.500
Pooh! We're stuck!

09:37.500 --> 09:40.125
And can't get down, too!

09:40.125 --> 09:44.416
Never fear!
Papa Heffalump is here!

09:44.416 --> 09:46.750
Step aside! Step aside!

09:46.750 --> 09:51.166
- Tiggers are experts
at climbing trees!
- One side! One side!

09:51.166 --> 09:52.958
Hey, watch where you're going,
you Sunday climber.

09:52.958 --> 09:55.583
Mama Heffalump: Yeah, Papa,
you're up awfully high.

09:55.583 --> 09:58.125
- So?
- Don't you remember?

09:58.125 --> 10:01.000
You're allergic to high heights.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.875
Heights too, huh?

10:12.875 --> 10:16.583
My baby!
Whatever shall we do?

10:18.458 --> 10:22.583
What we need is teamwork.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.000
Now, remember, everyone,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.625
on the count of three.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.958
One...

10:29.958 --> 10:31.333
Three!

10:33.500 --> 10:36.875
- Can we get down now?
- Down?

10:36.875 --> 10:38.875
Tigger:
That a boy, buddy bear.

10:38.875 --> 10:41.083
That's the way to throw
your weight around.

10:43.875 --> 10:46.500
Oh, bother.
For a camping trip,

10:46.500 --> 10:49.375
I sure am doing
a lot of flying.

10:49.375 --> 10:52.750
Yeah, and a lot of landing, too.

10:52.750 --> 10:57.458
Pooh:
Sorry we thought your house
was a woodpile, Mr. Heffalhip--

10:57.458 --> 11:00.166
um, Mr. half-a-hump--

11:00.166 --> 11:03.500
We'll help fix it up
in the morning.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.458
Papa Heffalump:
You're rootin'-tootin',
you will!

11:05.458 --> 11:09.875
It was all one big
misunderstanding.

11:09.875 --> 11:12.875
- Uh, have a marshmallow?
- Thanks!

11:14.333 --> 11:17.750
Oh, dear, Papa!
Marshmallows?

11:17.750 --> 11:20.291
So?

11:20.291 --> 11:21.958
Mama Heffalump:
Don't you remember?

11:21.958 --> 11:23.708
Papa Heffalump:
Oh, yeah.

11:50.708 --> 11:52.333
Oh, hello.

11:52.333 --> 11:55.375
Might Christopher Robin
be at home?

11:55.375 --> 11:59.291
Silly old bear, it is me.

11:59.291 --> 12:02.291
And who might that be?

12:02.291 --> 12:04.000
A balloon, Pooh.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.083
You know,
made of rubber and air?

12:08.083 --> 12:11.250
In that case,
may I take it for a walk?

12:11.250 --> 12:14.500
Well, if you're careful
not to pop it.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.875
I shall take care of it
as if it were--

12:17.875 --> 12:20.125
as if it were honey.

12:20.125 --> 12:24.291
Then it's in the best
of hands, Pooh.

12:24.291 --> 12:25.583
Whee!

12:30.291 --> 12:34.875
anywhere we please

12:44.458 --> 12:48.958
when we land

12:56.458 --> 13:01.583
in my hands

13:03.708 --> 13:09.166
-

13:09.166 --> 13:12.000
Why, you flying feather duster!

13:12.000 --> 13:14.750
I'll-- I'll-- Whoa!

13:21.333 --> 13:25.750
There's got to be a way to keep
those birds out of my garden.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.375
I've got it!

13:33.375 --> 13:35.333
A brilliant idea!

13:37.833 --> 13:40.750
But I need that balloon!

13:40.750 --> 13:43.750
Oh, hello, Rabbit.

13:43.750 --> 13:47.166
Why, hello, Pooh Bear.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.875
Nice balloon you've got there.

13:49.875 --> 13:52.125
Yes, isn't it?

13:52.125 --> 13:54.625
Christopher Robin
let me borrow it.

13:54.625 --> 14:01.708
You know, I was wondering
if I could borrow it from you.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.083
Well, I don't know.

14:06.958 --> 14:08.875
Honey!

14:08.875 --> 14:13.750
Yes, fresh honey.

14:13.750 --> 14:16.375
Fresh.

14:16.375 --> 14:19.875
You know, watching
Christopher Robin's balloon

14:19.875 --> 14:24.000
has made me a bit hungry,
Rabbit?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.875
I don't suppose
you could look after it for me?

14:27.875 --> 14:31.416
Pooh, I suppose I could.

14:31.416 --> 14:36.333
Always glad-- happy--
ready to help a friend.

14:36.333 --> 14:39.875
But be very, very careful
with it.

14:39.875 --> 14:43.875
I promised Christopher Robin
that I would take care of it.

14:45.833 --> 14:49.208
You're just the thing I need!

14:53.625 --> 14:55.833
Perfect!

15:00.583 --> 15:01.708
There.

15:01.708 --> 15:03.958
That should do the trick.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.083
Oh, hello. You must be
a friend of Rabbit's.

15:28.083 --> 15:29.458
Have you come to visit him?

15:30.875 --> 15:33.458
Oh, no need to be shy.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.166
I'm a friend of rabbit's, too.

15:37.958 --> 15:39.291
Yike!

15:41.875 --> 15:43.875
Help!

15:50.125 --> 15:52.583
Run, Tigger! Run!

15:52.583 --> 15:55.875
There's a big monster
right behind me!

15:55.875 --> 15:57.458
Where?

15:57.458 --> 16:00.166
Let me at him!
Let me at him!

16:00.166 --> 16:03.083
Hey, don't get pushy!
Don't get pushy!

16:03.083 --> 16:05.708
I think he's mad.

16:05.708 --> 16:07.500
Oh, a tough guy, eh?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.083
Ha! You missed me!

16:11.083 --> 16:12.833
This guy isn't so tough.

16:15.416 --> 16:16.708
Hmm.

16:16.708 --> 16:19.125
This calls for
a little strategery.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.833
Listen, Piglet, follow me.

16:26.291 --> 16:29.166
Okay, Piglet,
now, here's the plan.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.500
Get him!

16:39.291 --> 16:42.166
Good work, Piglet!
You got him on the run!

16:42.166 --> 16:43.458
Don't let go!

16:43.458 --> 16:46.708
What's going on? Wha--

16:47.750 --> 16:50.708
The balloon, it's gone.

16:52.291 --> 16:53.708
-

16:55.000 --> 16:57.125
Oh, my! Oh, my!
Oh, my, my, my!

16:57.125 --> 16:59.083
- Yo!

17:01.750 --> 17:03.250
I got you, kid!
I got--

17:03.250 --> 17:04.875
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

17:08.250 --> 17:11.625
Where's the balloon?

17:11.625 --> 17:13.458
How could you?

17:13.458 --> 17:15.583
How could you?

17:15.583 --> 17:18.166
How could we what,
bunny boy?

17:18.166 --> 17:20.875
You broke my scarecrow.

17:20.875 --> 17:23.708
Oh, my. Oh, my-- The balloon.

17:23.708 --> 17:26.000
I borrowed it from Booh Pear--
Pooh Bear--

17:26.000 --> 17:27.500
who borrowed it
from Ristopher Crobin--

17:27.500 --> 17:30.000
Ristopher Cribbin--

17:31.833 --> 17:34.000
It's Pooh Bear.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.625
Pooh Bear! Quick!
Back to the house!

17:35.625 --> 17:38.458
- I gotta go home!
-

17:45.000 --> 17:47.416
uh, treetop

17:51.000 --> 17:52.375
-

17:52.375 --> 17:54.708
- What happened to the ba--
- Shh!

17:54.708 --> 17:57.875
The balloon's asleep,
Pooh Bear.

17:57.875 --> 18:00.708
I don't hear it sleeping,
Rabbit.

18:03.291 --> 18:07.000
You know, it's much smaller
when it sleeps.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.250
Why absotively posilutely!

18:09.250 --> 18:11.083
They have to shrink, Pooh,

18:11.083 --> 18:14.333
so they can fit in the bed...

18:14.333 --> 18:16.750
for goodness sake.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.291
Wake up, balloon.

18:19.291 --> 18:23.083
Time to go back
to Christopher Robin.

18:23.083 --> 18:26.083
No, you'll wake it, Pooh.

18:26.083 --> 18:30.625
Why, it's not sleeping.
Its eyes are open.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.291
But shouldn't it be big now?

18:33.291 --> 18:35.125
Now that it's awake, I mean.

18:35.125 --> 18:37.583
Oh, it's no good.

18:37.583 --> 18:41.083
Pooh, we popped the balloon.

18:41.083 --> 18:42.625
Oh, bother.

18:44.625 --> 18:47.333
What shall I tell
Christopher Robin?

18:47.333 --> 18:50.875
You don't suppose he'd believe
it was asleep, do you?

18:50.875 --> 18:54.958
No! I must tell him the truth!

18:54.958 --> 18:58.708
No, no, no! If you tell him
that he popped his balloon,

18:58.708 --> 19:02.125
he'll never talk to us again.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.583
We must make a pact

19:04.583 --> 19:07.750
to never tell Christopher Robin
about this.

19:07.750 --> 19:11.625
Now raise your right hands
and right legs.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.708
Now, jump and down and promise,

19:15.708 --> 19:18.291
Friends together,
friends apart,

19:18.291 --> 19:21.333
I'll never, never,
cross my heart,

19:21.333 --> 19:23.375
tell how this balloon
was popped.

19:23.375 --> 19:27.500
And if I do, I hope I drop.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.125
Now you hide it.

19:38.875 --> 19:42.416
Oh, can't sleep either,
huh, balloon?

19:58.583 --> 20:02.875
You, Pooh Bear, have been
accused of popping a balloon!

20:05.166 --> 20:06.875
He broke my balloon!

20:06.875 --> 20:10.500
How can I ever speak
to him again?

20:11.833 --> 20:13.583
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

20:13.583 --> 20:15.625
Silence!

20:15.625 --> 20:18.583
Pooh Bear, how do you plead?

20:20.291 --> 20:22.166
Guilty!

20:22.166 --> 20:25.250
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

20:25.250 --> 20:28.000
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

20:28.000 --> 20:30.375
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

20:30.375 --> 20:34.083
Christopher!

20:34.083 --> 20:36.458
Oh, my! It's Pooh Bear!

20:36.458 --> 20:40.875
Oh, he's gonna tell
Christopher Robin
about the balloon.

20:45.708 --> 20:48.416
Watch where you're going!

20:48.416 --> 20:52.500
You almost made me drop
Christopher Robin's balloon.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.958
But I'm Christopher Robin's
balloon.

20:54.958 --> 20:59.083
What are you talking about?
I've got his balloon.

21:07.708 --> 21:10.750
Now, what are you three up to?

21:10.750 --> 21:13.291
I'm sorry,

21:13.291 --> 21:17.708
but I broke your balloon,
Christopher Robin.

21:17.708 --> 21:21.708
No, I did. Tiggers are
the ballooniest breakers.

21:21.708 --> 21:25.833
Uh, I'm actually the one
who p-p-popped it.

21:25.833 --> 21:29.625
Christopher Robin, we're sorry,
but we all broke your balloon.

21:33.458 --> 21:39.250
Christopher Robin,
I have broken your balloon.

21:39.250 --> 21:42.708
It's not broken,
it's only untied.

21:42.708 --> 21:44.166
The air's out of it.

21:50.125 --> 21:53.416
Oh, no! Not again!

21:53.416 --> 21:55.958
Hold on,
you two balloony brains!

21:58.958 --> 22:00.333
Oh, my.

22:00.333 --> 22:01.458
Oh, my.

22:01.458 --> 22:03.500
Oh, my.

22:03.500 --> 22:07.000
Hey! Come back,
you balloonatics!
