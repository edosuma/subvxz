WEBVTT

00:06.600 --> 00:09.440
I'm going to send you
to a series of checkpoints.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.000
You won't know the final destination
until you arrive.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.520
Mark isn't a part of this.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.480
I need to know that he's walking away.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.280
PALMER:  Do as I say,
he gets to go home

00:17.360 --> 00:18.440
and watch The One Show.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.240
JOHN:  And Alice?

00:20.800 --> 00:21.800
Sorry.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.400
You know how it is.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.760
I still need to know
he's all right, I need proof.

00:28.880 --> 00:29.880
You have my word.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.320
I said I need proof.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.360
PALMER: Stay by your phone.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.240
Oh...

01:48.760 --> 01:49.760
Oh, yeah.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.560
Yes, yes I did.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.600
-Organic, yes.
-Excuse me.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.440
And the kitchen rope.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.880
No, no, I got Braeburns instead.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.400
-Sorry, excuse me.
-About 10 minutes.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.760
Yeah. Love you. Yes. Yeah. Love you.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.360
-MAN: Bye.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.160
I'm so sorry.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.040
Er, I'm afraid you dropped this.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.120
That's so kind, thank you.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.080
No worries. Happy to help.

02:55.560 --> 03:00.720
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

03:02.280 --> 03:07.760
♪ For the ones
that feel it the most

03:09.640 --> 03:15.280
♪ Look at her
with her eyes like a flame

03:16.440 --> 03:19.760
♪ She will love you like a fly

03:19.840 --> 03:24.720
♪ Will never love you again ♪

03:44.240 --> 03:45.560
Stay away from the door, he said.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.400
He's not here, is he?

03:47.720 --> 03:49.120
He's out there.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.920
Preparing to kill John.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.960
And then you. And then me.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.640
If that's what he wants,
why hasn't he done it already?

03:59.800 --> 04:01.600
ALICE: John wouldn't come here
without proof of life.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.720
Well, your life anyway.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.960
Mine, not so much.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.720
You make a good bag lady.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.360
Thank you. Listen, we need every scrap
of insulation we can find

04:17.560 --> 04:19.640
or we'll have frozen to death
by the time he gets here.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.080
Don't you give me the runaround.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.480
Don't you give me the runaround.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.160
Guv, where are you?

04:44.280 --> 04:46.200
So it turns out Jeremy Lake was keeping,

04:46.360 --> 04:48.120
I don't know...
Er, I don't know what to call it,

04:48.200 --> 04:50.080
-Look, Catherine, I need some help.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.920
What sort of help?

04:52.120 --> 04:53.920
I just need you to find someone
for me, all right?

04:54.040 --> 04:55.560
His name's, er,

04:55.640 --> 04:57.240
Ronald Massey.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.960
He works for a man I need to find.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.720
Erm, Guv, I can't just...
I mean, who is he?

05:03.800 --> 05:05.960
JOHN:  Look, Catherine,
I'll be there as soon as I can.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.160
I'll bring in Jeremy Lake but I need you
to do this first, okay?

05:09.240 --> 05:10.520
Can you just do it?

05:10.600 --> 05:11.600
-Boss, I...
-JOHN: Catherine,

05:12.280 --> 05:13.280
do it.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.560
HALLIDAY: Massey. Let's see.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.840
Ronald Massey.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.800
HALLIDAY: The mask's
of Lake's own face,

06:22.880 --> 06:25.440
which is new behaviour,
as far as we know.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.680
But it is consistent with some
of the images in the diary.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.160
SCHENK: His condition disinhibiting him?

06:33.440 --> 06:35.880
Yeah, or maybe he knows
we're breathing down his neck

06:35.960 --> 06:38.800
and he's decided to go
all carpe diem on us.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.760
Do we have the faintest notion
where DCI Luther is?

06:43.880 --> 06:45.200
Sorry, boss.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.920
Catherine, do you know anything

06:49.000 --> 06:50.040
I don't know?

06:51.920 --> 06:53.280
Sorry, boss, no.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.560
Vivien Lake knows her husband's mind.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.600
She's the only one who can help us
get ahead on this.

07:01.920 --> 07:02.920
Let's bring her in.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.440
Well, she's being treated
at the hospital.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.840
I don't care.
Wheel her in in a gurney if needs be.

07:16.680 --> 07:20.440
Hey, Guv, I don't know what your
other thing is but the big boss

07:20.560 --> 07:22.200
he's on his last nerve and I...

07:22.320 --> 07:24.960
I don't feel comfortable lying for you.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.480
And things are really kicking off here.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.680
We need you.

07:33.880 --> 07:37.400
Hello, I'm inquiring about
the availability of Illeana.

07:37.680 --> 07:38.680
This evening.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.520
Overnight, for preference.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.840
Ah, good. Thank you.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.920
Yes, hello, King of Plumbers,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.240
I have a dreadful smell
coming from my drains.

08:10.760 --> 08:11.760
Thank you.

08:18.760 --> 08:19.800
SCHENK: Dr Lake,

08:21.360 --> 08:22.720
would you follow me, please?

08:35.040 --> 08:36.240
That's right, quickly now.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.400
Boss,

08:41.920 --> 08:42.920
we should probably go.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.720
Nah, sod it. It's just a drill.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.880
Well, they usually say
when it's a drill.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.840
We'll go when the hair on your bollocks
starts to sizzle.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.000
I just... Let me go and check.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.080
Yeah, yeah.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.280
Call him off.

09:36.800 --> 09:37.800
We're on schedule.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.680
Luther should be here soon.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.440
Er, yeah, I actually need you
to hold off on that for a bit.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.080
Why?

09:44.160 --> 09:45.240
CORNELIUS: Because that's what I want.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.680
We entered into a contract.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.040
Er, you... You'll get your money,
just, erm, tell me where they are

09:51.120 --> 09:53.080
and then, er,
take the rest of the day off.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.680
-Go to the pictures or something.
-Come on. Come on.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.840
It's not that easy.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.440
A police officer is dead.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.280
I can't have that coming back on me.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.840
Ah, it... It won't come back on you.

10:02.920 --> 10:04.760
Just text me the address and then

10:05.000 --> 10:07.240
pack your sandwiches and go home.
I'll make sure everything's

10:07.400 --> 10:08.400
tied off.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.480
He says a copper's dead.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.120
Yeah.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.080
-That would be your mate.
-Yes.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.160
Well, for what it's worth,
I didn't ask for that.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.280
Didn't you?

10:28.760 --> 10:30.400
Your mate chucked it in for free,
didn't he?

10:31.960 --> 10:33.360
So where does that leave us?

10:42.920 --> 10:44.440
I came to off you for Benny.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.800
-I'm going to end this.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.080
JOHN: All this eye for an eye bullshit,
it's all just a game, isn't it, George?

11:15.240 --> 11:16.240
You don't want this.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.520
You don't want any of it.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.120
Do you?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.160
You lost your discipline, George.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.880
You robbed Alice, she robbed you back,
now Alice is dead.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.440
That's not her fault, that's your fault.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.520
Benny's dead.
That's not your fault, that's my fault.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.520
I couldn't shoot you in the head
because I made a mistake.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.400
But if you can shoot me
then go ahead and do it.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.840
It doesn't change anything,
does it, George?

11:36.920 --> 11:38.760
What I lost was my son.

11:40.760 --> 11:41.760
George.

11:43.680 --> 11:44.680
Take it.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.360
Eye for an eye.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.880
You think I won't do this
and piss on your body after?

11:56.680 --> 11:57.880
Go on, George.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.200
Just do it.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.560
Just do it.

12:05.800 --> 12:06.800
Go on.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.240
PALMER: Stop there.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.600
Do you have a gun?

12:39.320 --> 12:40.320
Oh, er...

12:49.120 --> 12:50.240
So, where is Luther?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
He's in the boot.

12:54.840 --> 12:55.840
Dead?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.440
As a dodo's granddad.

13:00.720 --> 13:01.720
How did you find him?

13:02.680 --> 13:04.240
He came to me, as it happens.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.360
And how did he find you?

13:07.640 --> 13:09.280
I'm not entirely sure, to be frank.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.800
But there you are.
He was a clever old sausage,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.560
but not bulletproof, as it turns out.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.440
-Open the boot.
-CORNELIUS: Oh, come on.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.600
Now. If you would...

13:26.160 --> 13:27.960
Open the boot.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.720
All right, all right.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.360
As you speak, so shall it be.

13:45.880 --> 13:46.880
Oi!

14:01.200 --> 14:02.200
PALMER: I don't get it.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.520
Peace In Our Time.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.160
I'm Adolf, he's Neville,
you're the Sudetenland.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.920
JOHN: You're going to go down.
You're going to go to prison

14:08.000 --> 14:09.960
for killing my friend.
Do you understand that?

14:10.800 --> 14:11.920
And if I don't agree?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.440
I shoot you dead right now
and tell a story to my boss.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.760
-No!

14:31.080 --> 14:32.080
What did I tell you?

14:32.880 --> 14:34.000
You're going to jail.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.360
-And you're going to hate...

14:39.280 --> 14:40.600
CORNELIUS: Sorry, old bean.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.240
Couldn't take the risk.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.600
-Here we are.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.560
You, smoking gun,
damning evidence and whatnot.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.400
All in the cloud.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.680
Whatever that actually is.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.560
Hand over the gun.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.040
I think it's one of mine, anyway.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.720
You're a clever one, ain't you, George?

15:05.800 --> 15:07.160
You would have been a good copper.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.440
CORNELIUS: No.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.840
Too honest to have been a copper.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.440
Schenk came to me, John.

15:14.720 --> 15:17.280
He knows something's
not right between me and you.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.480
I'll settle this with Schenk.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.640
He trusts me.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.480
Yeah, so do I.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.760
But only because I got this.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.280
Alice?

16:07.120 --> 16:08.120
Alice?

16:21.680 --> 16:22.680
Oh, shit.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.360
Shit.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.520
MARK: Is your friend in there?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.720
JOHN: Yeah.
MARK: Aren't you gonna call someone?

16:39.840 --> 16:40.840
I'll find him.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.440
Well, we can't just leave him here.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.520
JOHN: We have to.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.240
For God's sake, he's your friend!

16:48.840 --> 16:50.800
Got himself killed trying to protect us.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.360
Do you think I want
to be doing this, Mark?

16:55.440 --> 16:57.640
Do you think I want to be doing this?

17:11.160 --> 17:12.440
Benny's dead.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.000
The man who killed him is dead.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.600
What I'm trying to do is handle it
so that your name is clear.

17:25.360 --> 17:26.720
What time does your wife get back?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.760
Half

17:30.160 --> 17:32.120
I think we need to get back
and clean the scene.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.920
What's happened to you, John?

18:05.880 --> 18:07.640
ALICE: What about
the George Cornelius problem?

18:08.520 --> 18:09.520
Have you dealt with it?

18:11.480 --> 18:12.480
Yeah.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.640
-Yeah.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.480
Because it's the only way.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.920
He'll kill us both. You do know that?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Alice, it's done.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.800
You wouldn't lie to me, would you, John?

18:25.640 --> 18:27.280
Not about something this important.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.480
No.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.440
Because you're the only person
I ever knew

18:38.480 --> 18:39.800
who always told me the truth.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.520
Come what may.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.640
You never lie to me.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.360
It's done.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.880
That'll be your fancy lady
calling you in for tea.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.400
Oh, why don't you just give it a rest.
I've got to deal with this thing.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.760
Deal with it, then.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.600
Just go home and we'll talk later.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.800
Good luck with your whatnot.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.360
CORNELIUS:  Hello?

19:49.640 --> 19:51.240
Hello, who is this?

19:53.880 --> 19:54.880
Hello...

20:26.240 --> 20:27.800
I hope you're not too uncomfortable.

20:29.320 --> 20:33.120
A young woman just stabbed me,
of course I'm uncomfortable.

20:34.080 --> 20:38.480
I'm afraid that a number of doctors
have certified you fit to be questioned.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.960
And if there's one thing we can all
agree on is, well,

20:43.040 --> 20:44.440
you can always trust a doctor.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.080
Right?

20:50.200 --> 20:52.880
SCHENK: We know your husband
is gravely ill, Vivien.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.960
Jeremy doesn't have long.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.040
One more Christmas, perhaps.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.880
But he'll never see another summer.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.840
Now, if we can find and detain him,

21:06.040 --> 21:07.680
his case will never get to court.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.560
He'll never go to prison.

21:10.320 --> 21:14.640
The worst he can expect is
a few months in a secure hospital.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.520
But he will stop.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.120
This will stop.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.360
This

21:30.960 --> 21:32.360
will stop.

21:38.800 --> 21:39.800
And this.

21:46.240 --> 21:49.520
It will stop.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.600
I have no idea
about Jeremy's activities.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.720
I'm as horrified as you.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.400
Oh, I doubt if you have the capacity.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.920
And to be fair, we did catch you
in a plastic-lined room

22:32.000 --> 22:35.600
getting ready to disarticulate
Penny Leyton with surgical tools.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.960
I'm afraid you've misinterpreted
that situation.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.600
Actually, I was there to rescue her.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.360
Get her out of there. Poor thing.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.560
But you were wearing surgical scrubs

22:46.960 --> 22:48.920
and were attacking her with a hammer.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.360
I was defending myself

22:52.440 --> 22:55.040
from a very confused
and frightened young woman.

22:55.840 --> 22:59.360
Who understandably, given her
state of delirium, misread the situation

22:59.600 --> 23:01.520
-and believed, incorrectly...

23:02.320 --> 23:03.920
...that I was there to do her ill.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.640
SCHENK: I have to make a call.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.880
We've had some urgent news.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.200
Let's hope it's the news we all want,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
eh?

23:24.480 --> 23:27.520
DS Halliday,
if you would hold the fort, please?

23:40.520 --> 23:41.760
Where have you been?

23:45.000 --> 23:48.040
I got called away, erm,
to something that didn't pan out, boss.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.760
Any news from Benny?

23:52.840 --> 23:55.480
No. No, he called in sick.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.640
I've been called away.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.520
I want you in there with Vivien Lake.

24:02.880 --> 24:03.960
On my way.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.280
MARTIN:
What do I need to know?

24:21.360 --> 24:24.240
Sir, we were investigating
reported gunshots.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.040
You might wanna get

24:26.160 --> 24:27.480
somewhere private.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.680
SCHENK: I am somewhere private.
Go ahead.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.040
We found a disposable phone
in the glovebox.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.320
Call reports?

24:51.080 --> 24:53.240
Most likely any calls were made
to another burner.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.600
SCHENK: Fine.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.080
So I will need you to determine

25:00.480 --> 25:02.320
where that phone was last used.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.280
See if you can find any CCTV footage

25:05.360 --> 25:07.120
corresponding with the time and place

25:07.400 --> 25:08.400
of that usage.

25:08.680 --> 25:09.680
Absolutely.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.520
You have all the resources you need,

25:11.720 --> 25:14.040
but none of the time. I want this now.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.320
End this.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.760
Stays schtum.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.400
Are we clear?

25:22.240 --> 25:24.400
Nobody says a word.

25:24.800 --> 25:25.840
Okay.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.840
Sorry, I'm late.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.240
I had a very busy day.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
So,

26:04.360 --> 26:05.640
where did you meet,

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
you and Jeremy?

26:10.120 --> 26:11.280
Is that relevant?

26:12.160 --> 26:13.160
I don't know.

26:16.840 --> 26:21.080
We struck up a conversation at
a dinner party talking about Tony Blair

26:22.000 --> 26:23.720
over baked Brie and raspberry jam.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
That's not true.

26:26.280 --> 26:29.800
You met at a play party,
basically a fetish club.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.560
You really are
a bourgeois little prince, aren't you?

26:37.240 --> 26:38.600
Thought police.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.760
Sex police.

26:42.120 --> 26:44.080
Erecting an edifice of speculation,

26:44.160 --> 26:45.240
a foundation

26:45.400 --> 26:47.240
for puritanical distaste.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.480
No, that's not what I'm doing.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.200
I'm basically trying to establish

26:51.280 --> 26:52.920
whether you would lie
to protect your privacy,

26:53.000 --> 26:56.880
and the answer turns out to be "yes",
which I find very interesting.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.560
Did you know that Jeremy

27:00.320 --> 27:01.600
kept a diary?

27:05.480 --> 27:07.520
Bit of a leap to conclude
that's a diary, isn't it?

27:07.600 --> 27:10.080
It looks more like a sketchbook to me.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.240
Okay, what about these?

27:15.480 --> 27:18.480
These are actual drawings
of murder scenes

27:18.720 --> 27:21.360
which makes me think about
these other sketches too,

27:21.480 --> 27:24.000
which are, well, I don't know, I mean,

27:24.160 --> 27:25.280
are these real too?

27:25.920 --> 27:26.920
Clearly not.

27:28.040 --> 27:31.080
It's an explication
of Jeremy's fantasy life. An outlet.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.360
A masturbatory aid, nothing more.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.800
Yeah, possibly, it could be.
But it's not just the drawings, is it?

27:38.720 --> 27:40.560
I mean it's the... The text.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.360
Well, that'll be, erm,

27:46.080 --> 27:48.400
cipher text of Jeremy's
own construction.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.720
Well, God knows what it says.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.080
Do you think you could
decipher it for us?

27:51.160 --> 27:52.320
Well, I'd love to.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.960
But I very much doubt I'd be able.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.320
You have to get rid
of this stuff properly.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.280
No throwing it away in your own bin.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.200
Oh, thank heavens I'm here with
a criminal mastermind.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.200
Otherwise whatever would I have done.

28:12.840 --> 28:13.960
I have to go, Mark.

28:14.240 --> 28:15.520
I promise you won't see me again.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.480
Well, that'll be a shame.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.240
Some valedictory advice.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.360
Don't let John Luther
back through your door.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.400
Not under any circumstance
or for any reason.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.520
He's not what you think he is.

28:41.680 --> 28:42.680
Alice,

28:45.000 --> 28:46.720
you have to stop.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.000
Oh, God knows you are what you are,
but you're not a psychopath!

28:51.080 --> 28:52.280
You're... You're not

28:53.160 --> 28:55.800
without conscience.
You cannot live like this!

28:57.840 --> 28:58.840
I know.

28:59.760 --> 29:00.840
Do you need help?

29:01.120 --> 29:02.680
-Is there something I...

29:04.840 --> 29:06.000
Hello?

29:16.680 --> 29:19.840
I had a boss, once.
Her name was Rose Teller.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.760
Really good cop.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.360
She used to say, erm,

29:24.600 --> 29:28.120
an assumption is something
you don't know you're making.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.240
Do you know the assumption
you're making, Vivien?

29:37.640 --> 29:41.000
Oh, I might be able to help answer that.

29:42.760 --> 29:48.520
You're assuming that Jeremy doesn't want
people to read what he's written.

29:48.760 --> 29:51.600
Then why employ a cipher text
in the first place?

29:52.600 --> 29:55.360
Because he doesn't want you
to know what he's written.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.640
He doesn't want you to know
that he's written it all down.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.360
Everything that you've done, together.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.840
Dates. Times.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.560
Places.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.520
JOHN: Because that's the difference
between you and him, isn't it?

30:13.600 --> 30:15.520
I mean, you are very private,

30:15.600 --> 30:18.360
don't want anyone to know the truth
about you, not ever.

30:18.440 --> 30:21.560
And he is very proud of what he's done.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.480
He's done with being anonymous.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.880
He's done with someone else
taking the credit.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.240
This isn't a diary, it's a confession,
isn't it?

30:33.760 --> 30:35.120
And where does that leave you?

30:36.640 --> 30:37.880
-I don't know...
-Yes, you do!

30:38.720 --> 30:40.360
You do, Vivien, don't you?

30:42.040 --> 30:43.120
You know exactly

30:44.040 --> 30:45.040
where that leaves you

30:45.200 --> 30:48.800
if Jeremy has implicated you
as an accessory to murder.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.600
You know exactly what that means.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.960
Well, obviously he wouldn't do that.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.440
Are you willing to bet
the rest of your life on that?

30:56.080 --> 30:58.240
JOHN: No, of course you're not.
Because he has

30:58.360 --> 31:00.440
been letting you down recently,
hasn't he?

31:02.400 --> 31:03.600
Come on, Vivien.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.600
Help us and we can help you.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.120
You are going to prison, Vivien,

31:11.600 --> 31:13.600
but for how long is really up to you.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.240
Can I have a glass of water, please?

31:24.600 --> 31:25.920
No, you may not.

31:35.760 --> 31:39.000
Jeremy's most outré fantasy,
and I have to stress,

31:39.120 --> 31:41.960
to the best of my knowledge,
it was just a fantasy,

31:43.280 --> 31:45.840
was to play a game of what he called
"Happy Families".

31:48.840 --> 31:51.520
To sit in a house
and summon people to him.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.040
Have them turn up at the door.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.440
Lambs to the slaughter.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.240
Sir.

32:36.520 --> 32:37.840
The phone was used here.

32:38.840 --> 32:39.840
He arrives alone.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.920
SCHENK: George Cornelius.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.880
All right, George,

33:00.640 --> 33:03.320
you wanted it old school.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.880
Thanks for coming so quickly.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.080
Yeah, no worries.
Erm, so what are we looking at?

33:17.200 --> 33:18.520
Oh, through there.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.120
HALLIDAY: So, Jeremy Lake's
gone to ground.

33:31.640 --> 33:34.160
He's holed up somewhere
getting people to come to him.

33:34.560 --> 33:35.840
How are we supposed to find him?

33:35.920 --> 33:38.080
There are like,
60,000 streets in London.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.560
And previous murders,
they don't tell us anything.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.680
There... There's no pattern.
They're random.

33:42.760 --> 33:44.520
But they're not disorganised, are they?

33:47.120 --> 33:48.120
I mean, everything he's doing,

33:48.200 --> 33:50.720
he's doing to tell himself
how clever he is.

33:50.800 --> 33:53.640
Oh, the audacity of that. I mean,

33:55.560 --> 33:58.160
he can take care of whoever he wants
whenever he wants.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.760
He can have the police
run around in circles.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.960
He can make the police
blame the wrong man

34:05.040 --> 34:06.640
and then he's come to an end.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.040
Which means he's gone somewhere

34:10.400 --> 34:12.240
of significance, with meaning.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.840
-To us.

34:15.160 --> 34:16.280
To him.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.600
And if you were him, right,
where's the most

34:18.960 --> 34:20.760
audacious place you could go?

34:21.280 --> 34:25.000
If I were him, I would go home.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.760
No. Too big a police presence.

34:29.040 --> 34:30.840
Where's the next best equivalent?

34:34.240 --> 34:37.040
Well, if I couldn't go to where
the police are,

34:37.720 --> 34:39.560
I'd go to where they just left.

34:39.680 --> 34:41.520
Left. Right, yes. Ballarat Street.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.960
The schoolteacher. Yeah.

34:45.440 --> 34:46.680
Should we tell someone?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.160
No.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.480
Not until we've checked it out.

34:52.200 --> 34:54.080
-I am sure. Come on.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.680
JEREMY: Illeana?

35:23.440 --> 35:26.160
-Wow, you look lovely.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.840

Without alerting DCI Luther
to this order, I need you

38:13.480 --> 38:16.600
to bring him back
to the station as soon as possible.

38:17.240 --> 38:18.280
Okay, yeah.

38:22.440 --> 38:25.920
every chance that he will run,
do you understand me?

38:26.280 --> 38:27.280
Yep, got it.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.480
Good.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.920
Now, get him back to the station.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.360
Tell him

38:36.000 --> 38:39.360
I have some interesting news.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.840
And I want to give him

38:41.920 --> 38:43.520
it face to face.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.800
Schenk has asked you to bring me
back in, hasn't he?

38:50.040 --> 38:51.360
Er, yeah.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.360
Yeah, he said that he's got some news,
something he wants to tell you.

38:57.120 --> 38:58.560
Fair dues.

39:13.360 --> 39:15.000
I'm not going anywhere until this

39:15.480 --> 39:16.480
is dealt with.

39:18.680 --> 39:20.160
You think he's in there?

39:21.000 --> 39:22.160
-I know he is.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.880
Plumber's van. Pest control.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.800
Food delivery.
All people that would come to you.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.520
We can get back up in nine, ten minutes.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.080
We've got no evidence.

39:37.760 --> 39:40.640
If we call it in, we'll have to go
through due process.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.080
Get a warrant.
It would go on and on and on

39:43.160 --> 39:45.040
and what does that mean
for anyone that's alive in there now?

39:50.560 --> 39:52.000
If you found out tomorrow

39:52.800 --> 39:55.080
that if we went in there today
you could have saved someone's life,

39:55.160 --> 39:57.360
-Boss, that's not fair.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.320
All right, do what you have to do.

42:44.040 --> 42:45.560
DELIVERY MAN: Pizza delivery.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.240
Catherine.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.800
Get rid of him.

42:50.720 --> 42:51.720
But what about you?

42:52.520 --> 42:54.800
-DELIVERY MAN: Pizza.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.160
Catherine!

43:25.320 --> 43:26.320
Catherine!

43:34.800 --> 43:35.960
HALLIDAY: Stop, boss.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.600
-Boss...

43:50.960 --> 43:52.880
What did you think

44:18.040 --> 44:19.040
Are you okay?

44:20.360 --> 44:21.440
Yeah, yeah.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.120
You should know, Schenk's on his way.

44:29.360 --> 44:30.960
You called it in, didn't you?

44:35.840 --> 44:36.960
You...

44:37.480 --> 44:39.040
You know they're coming for me, right?

44:39.200 --> 44:40.360
Yeah.

44:41.040 --> 44:42.240
What did you do?

44:45.320 --> 44:46.760
Nothing I can't fix.

44:47.520 --> 44:48.640
I just need time.

44:50.840 --> 44:52.480
Are you... Are you asking me to...

44:52.880 --> 44:53.880
To let you go?

44:54.600 --> 44:57.000
Catherine, I have to go, okay?

44:57.640 --> 44:58.680
It's a mess.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.440
But it's not what it looks like,
I promise you that.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.760
Can I stop you from leaving?

45:07.440 --> 45:08.440
No.

45:10.640 --> 45:11.640
Then I won't try.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.040
John?

45:24.840 --> 45:26.600
Did you use me as bait in there?

45:31.080 --> 45:33.880
Send me downstairs to lure him out?

45:35.320 --> 45:36.320
No.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.320
I think you did.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.040
I think you dragged me here

45:44.200 --> 45:45.960
and threw me in front of him

45:46.040 --> 45:47.840
so that you could be
the man to stop him.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.880
That is not what happened.

45:57.480 --> 45:58.480
So what did happen?

46:03.960 --> 46:06.160
Why are you making such a fuss?

46:07.160 --> 46:10.600
I mean, this is what happens, isn't it,
to those of us who are no longer useful.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.280
ALICE: Who's next, hmm?

46:17.520 --> 46:18.600
Could it be me, I wonder?

46:18.800 --> 46:20.520
Well, no.

46:20.760 --> 46:23.200
I won't let that happen, John. I can't

46:23.360 --> 46:24.440
allow it.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.600
JOHN: She did nothing

46:29.080 --> 46:30.520
to you, Alice!

46:30.840 --> 46:33.480
Neither did my parents, really,
or Henry Madsen.

46:33.680 --> 46:35.640
Or Ian Reed. It never seemed to...

46:35.840 --> 46:37.760
You never seemed to mind, really,
though, did you?

46:38.960 --> 46:41.200
Well, what are you going
to do this time, DCI Luther?

46:42.080 --> 46:43.880
Arrest me? Well yes, you should!

46:44.520 --> 46:45.560
But you won't, will you?

46:45.880 --> 46:46.880
You'll let me go.

46:47.640 --> 46:50.080
Because think of the tales I could tell.

46:52.680 --> 46:53.680
But how?

46:54.440 --> 46:57.120
How are you going to cover
this up, I wonder?

47:01.320 --> 47:03.440
Quick, John, think of a lie.

47:05.040 --> 47:07.680
-Come on, come on, think of a lie!
-Put it down.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.880
Make me, liar. Liar!

47:09.960 --> 47:11.120
Liar!

47:12.600 --> 47:13.920
Next one's in your mouth.

47:15.240 --> 47:16.600
Put it down, Alice.

47:16.960 --> 47:18.320
-In a minute, liar. In a minute.
-Stop...

47:19.480 --> 47:20.800
Oh, oops!

50:22.080 --> 50:23.440
How many more bullets, Alice?

50:23.880 --> 50:25.440
Come and see, John.

50:29.240 --> 50:30.800
Honestly, I'm embarrassed.

50:34.080 --> 50:37.320
I can't believe it took me so long
to see that Zoe was right about you.

50:39.720 --> 50:41.120
You don't care about anyone, John.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.760
Not unless they can feed
your compulsions.

50:45.600 --> 50:46.760
Friends,

50:47.400 --> 50:49.600
enemies, it's all the same to you.
It doesn't matter.

50:50.040 --> 50:52.400
Even Zoe, you loved her so much more

50:52.480 --> 50:54.040
-when she was dead.
-You need to stop.

50:54.120 --> 50:56.240
It gave you an excuse to behave
exactly how you wanted.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.360
JOHN: You need help.

50:59.120 --> 51:00.640
It's just words, isn't it, Alice?

51:01.640 --> 51:03.200
-Just words!

51:03.360 --> 51:05.560
Trying to justify what you
really came here to do.

51:05.760 --> 51:08.520
Please do tell me.
-Well, free yourself!

51:10.080 --> 51:11.280
From this.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.320
From me and you.

51:15.640 --> 51:16.760
You keep coming back,

51:17.920 --> 51:19.520
and coming back, and coming back,

51:19.680 --> 51:22.560
but you're never going to get
what you want, Alice. Never.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.800
-Because what I want doesn't exist.
-JOHN: No.

51:27.480 --> 51:28.600
So how many more bullets, Alice?

51:28.920 --> 51:30.320
Yeah, well, I've got enough. Enough.

51:30.920 --> 51:32.280
How many more?

52:01.520 --> 52:03.040
What now, John?

52:07.920 --> 52:09.280
Alice Morgan,

52:09.600 --> 52:12.240
I'm arresting you for the...
The murder of...

52:15.160 --> 52:16.520
For the murder

52:17.120 --> 52:19.000
of Sergeant Catherine Halliday.

52:21.720 --> 52:23.160
Of course, you are.

52:25.640 --> 52:26.880
You have the right to remain...

52:29.920 --> 52:32.280
The thing is, John,
you don't understand love.

52:32.560 --> 52:33.960
You can mimic it,

52:34.360 --> 52:35.760
you can recognise it in others,

52:35.880 --> 52:38.120
but you can never understand it.

52:40.160 --> 52:41.360
Is this it?

52:42.280 --> 52:44.600
Is this it

52:45.880 --> 52:46.880
Yes.

52:48.040 --> 52:50.160
Guess what? I lied, too.

52:51.240 --> 52:52.440
There's one bullet left.

52:57.080 --> 52:58.880
I just needed us to be really close.

53:07.360 --> 53:08.640
Good night, John.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.360
Don't.

53:22.640 --> 53:23.880
Alice.

53:24.560 --> 53:25.960
You need to help me.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.440
No, Alice.

53:42.400 --> 53:43.400
No.

54:16.440 --> 54:18.280
-OFFICER: Show me your hands!

54:25.400 --> 54:26.680
