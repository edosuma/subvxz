00:07.215 --> 00:10.218
[suspenseful music playing]

00:10.301 --> 00:12.178
-Uh.
-[Sarah whimpering]

00:13.513 --> 00:14.681
I need you to push down, okay?

00:14.764 --> 00:16.891
Look, this is gonna hurt,
but I need you to push down.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.184
-[gasps]
-I'm sorry.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.270
I know it hurts.
We've gotta stop the bleeding.

00:20.353 --> 00:23.231
Push down. Push down.
Look, we gotta take this shirt off.

00:23.314 --> 00:26.568
I'm gonna push down.
You take the shirt off. Okay, here you go.

00:27.777 --> 00:30.363
Okay. Okay, lean back. Lean back.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.157
Just stay as still as possible.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.450
I'm gonna call Terrance.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.411
[line ringing]

00:36.494 --> 00:38.663
-[Terrance] Did you get the gold?
-Hey, look, we got it.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.498
-[Terrance] All right!
-[Cleo] You did it!

00:40.582 --> 00:42.459
We got it,
but listen, we have bigger problems.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.960
-Sarah's been shot.
-[Terrance] What?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.004
Yes, she's been shot in the gut.
I need your help.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.089
We're up in the cane field,
a mile up on the left.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.758
-[Terrance] Where you at?
-I'm not sure.

00:49.841 --> 00:52.218
I'll drop a pin.
I don't know how to get here. Hurry.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.304
-[Terrance] On our way. We'll find you.
-Okay.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.222
[Sarah panting]

00:57.849 --> 01:00.643
Help is on the way, okay?
Just stay with me.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.729
[dramatic music playing]

01:08.234 --> 01:09.486
[Cleo] Shit.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.570
Sarah!

01:10.653 --> 01:13.865
I just texted you the address of a doctor!
Tell him I sent you!

01:13.948 --> 01:15.241
Okay, and it's a hospital, right?

01:15.325 --> 01:16.701
No. You wanna get caught?

01:16.785 --> 01:18.828
I really don't give a shit, T.
She needs help.

01:18.912 --> 01:22.207
He's better than any of the doctors
in that shitcan. He's my guy. He got ya.

01:23.124 --> 01:27.796
Sarah, look, you gon' be okay. Okay, baby?
Just breathe, relax. Everything's good.

01:28.546 --> 01:31.007
We're gonna meet
at the wharf in eight hours.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.010
No more. It is hot as hell out there.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.845
My guy's good.
He's gonna take care of you.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.515
-And this is him, right?
-That's him. He got you. He's a good guy.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.600
-T? Thank you.
-[Terrance] We good, baby.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.686
-Come on. I got you!
-Hey, hey. You're gonna need some money.

01:44.354 --> 01:49.776
John B, take care of my girl. Sarah!
You're a fighter, girl! Hold on! Hold on!

01:49.859 --> 01:51.653
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:51.736 --> 01:53.738
[suspenseful music playing]

01:59.077 --> 02:01.037
What if they…
what if they take the gold?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.705
Look, screw the gold, okay?

02:02.789 --> 02:04.833
I'll take care of you.
We'll get you to the doctor.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.878
[man] Whoa, man! Hey! Watch out!

02:08.962 --> 02:10.839
[continues shouting indistinctly]

02:18.054 --> 02:20.348
[GPS voice] Your destination is
in four miles.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.100
Hey, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.936
-I'm just gonna follow this GPS, okay?
-[whimpering]

02:25.019 --> 02:26.980
[John B] Just hang on.
Everything's gonna be fine.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.276
[GPS voice] Turn left on State Road…

02:31.359 --> 02:32.193
[John B] Shit.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.822
-[horn honking]
-[tires squealing]

02:35.905 --> 02:37.448
Shit! I need the directions.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.659
-[Sarah groaning]
-[GPS voice] Left at the fork.

02:41.786 --> 02:42.912
Sarah, it's okay. It's okay.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.499
-[Sarah] John B, car!
-Shit!

02:47.125 --> 02:48.001
[horn honking]

02:48.084 --> 02:49.502
[crying]

02:50.295 --> 02:51.421
[tires squealing]

02:51.504 --> 02:53.256
[John B panting]

02:59.012 --> 03:02.182
[GPS voice] Your destination
is in 2.3 miles.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.809
[door opens]

03:06.227 --> 03:09.856
-Mr. Sunn, can I borrow Pope for a minute?
-[Mr. Sunn] We're in the middle of a test.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.358
[man] I'm from the Vanderhorst Foundation.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.402
Mr. Heyward, it's for you.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.907
[man] Thank you. Good to see you, Pope.

03:19.532 --> 03:24.037
First, I want you to know how sorry I am
about how the scholarship went down.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.207
It's okay. I kinda figured I lost it
after I walked out of the interview.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.627
Nevertheless, some of us
were very impressed by your story

03:30.710 --> 03:33.129
and wanted to learn more
about this Royal Merchant.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.049
Unfortunately,
the skeptics were in the majority.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.469
But listen,
one of the benefactors heard about it

03:39.552 --> 03:41.221
and asked me to pass something along.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.016
Now I can't guarantee
anything about a scholarship, but

03:45.642 --> 03:48.811
if you can get in the good graces
of the family, who knows?

03:48.895 --> 03:50.104
They're very powerful.

03:50.897 --> 03:51.731
Good luck.

04:07.455 --> 04:08.623
Okay, what was that?

04:11.042 --> 04:13.044
-Is that the wheat symbol?
-[Pope] Yeah.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.171
What the f--

04:15.255 --> 04:17.465
fu… fu… fudge?

04:22.178 --> 04:24.222
Hold on, Sarah. I'm coming. I'm coming.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.518
-Here we go. I got you.
-[Sarah gasps]

04:28.601 --> 04:30.103
Okay. Ready? Let's go.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.480
-[groans]
-I got you. I got you. I got you.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.192
-You guys know where the doctor is?
-In there.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.152
-Thank you.
-Okay.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.196
[groaning]

04:41.698 --> 04:43.908
[buzzing]

04:43.992 --> 04:45.493
-Come on!
-[doctor] What do you want?

04:45.576 --> 04:48.705
-I'm looking for Dr. Nygard.
-[doctor] Dr. Nygard's not here.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.124
Okay, well,
do you know where I can find him?

04:51.207 --> 04:53.167
-[doctor] Who are you?
-I'm a friend of Terrance's.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.420
-Okay, look, somebody's been shot.
-[doctor] Aw, hell.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.798
There's a camera above to your left.
Look at it and let me see your faces.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.844
All right, go through the bar.
There's some stairs on the right.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.513
Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.432
[wincing]

05:07.515 --> 05:09.225
[both grunting]

05:09.309 --> 05:11.728
-Thank you.
-[man] You guys gotta squeeze in. Okay.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.314
-Let's take another one. Smile this time.
-[John B] Doc!

05:14.397 --> 05:16.274
-[doctor] Bring her in here!
-Doc, where are you?

05:16.357 --> 05:17.734
[doctor] Here! Right here!

05:18.568 --> 05:21.237
-Hey! Hey!
-Yeah. Come on. Oh!

05:21.988 --> 05:24.449
-It's not her head, is it?
-No, it's not her head. Come on.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.075
I don't do heads.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.911
-You're good. You got two more. Two more.
-[Sarah groaning]

05:28.995 --> 05:29.829
Whoa. Whoa.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.206
Ah.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.834
-[John B] I gotcha.
-Go to the left over there.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.169
[John B] Come on. Almost there.

05:36.252 --> 05:39.339
[doctor] Ah, looks like
they got you pretty good, didn't they?

05:41.090 --> 05:44.594
-Where do you want me to put her, Doc?
-Take her straight down the hallway here.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.055
Damn! She's in worse shape than I am.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.349
Put her up there
on that table, right there.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.433
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.560
[doctor] It's all right.
Hang on a second here.

05:52.643 --> 05:53.603
[Sarah whimpering]

05:55.813 --> 05:57.273
Stay with me. Stay with me.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.442
Tell me what to do, Doc.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.486
Let's have a look at this thing.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.617
So what have we got here?

06:07.700 --> 06:09.369
Ah. Oh boy.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.038
She's… she's gonna be okay, right?

06:12.872 --> 06:14.082
That remains to be seen.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.876
[dramatic music playing]

06:16.959 --> 06:21.214
Do you know how much money
we got in the back of this truck?

06:21.297 --> 06:22.924
[laughing maniacally]

06:23.007 --> 06:24.008
You're tweakin', boss.

06:24.092 --> 06:27.303
You gotta put it outta your mind.
Coppers can sense your transmissions.

06:27.387 --> 06:33.267
You just don't understand, man.
I never had this kinda load in my life!

06:33.351 --> 06:34.394
Neither have I.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.646
And one of us is already shot,
so slow down.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.273
Hey. There's Stubby.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.193
Stubby, we rich, man!

06:44.487 --> 06:46.114
Oh, shit. Cops.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.365
[boat horn blaring]

06:48.157 --> 06:49.325
Get the tarp. The tarp.

06:51.911 --> 06:52.912
Guys! Hurry!

06:53.496 --> 06:54.330
[siren chirps]

06:54.956 --> 06:56.707
[indistinct chattering on radio]

06:58.793 --> 07:00.628
Hi, guys. [laughs nervously]

07:00.711 --> 07:02.046
Have a good day.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.426
[doctor] Put some pressure
on that wound, here.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.928
Yes, sir. [splutters]
What kinda doctor are you?

07:09.804 --> 07:11.055
I'm not a doctor.

07:12.014 --> 07:15.560
Not in the eyes of the law, anyway.
I'm more like a service provider.

07:15.643 --> 07:16.811
What… what does that mean?

07:16.894 --> 07:19.939
Tell you what, if you find a cure
for arthritis in med school,

07:20.022 --> 07:22.150
the higher-ups don't like it very much.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.944
You know, the powers that be
don't give a damn about curing anything.

07:25.027 --> 07:27.738
All they care about is the green stuff,
the money, the bottom line.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.198
-Follow me?
-Yeah, totally.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.410
Is there anything else I should be doing?
I don't know anything about this.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.663
Just be quiet a bit. Take that off
and let me study it a minute.

07:37.623 --> 07:42.253
She's bleedin' a little on the outside,
and she's bleedin' a lot on the inside.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.337
What does that mean?

07:44.005 --> 07:45.298
It means I can go in.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.218
You're… you're gonna sanitize that, right?

07:49.802 --> 07:52.013
-Good call, kid.
-[John B] Just tryin' to help.

07:52.096 --> 07:55.057
Now when I do go in,
she's gonna lose a lot of blood.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.726
-[John B] Okay.
-And it may kill her.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.812
-No. No.
-[doctor] Or it may not kill her.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.857
Point is I can't be held liable
for this either way.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.735
-You're not liable, all right?
-Yeah. There's one more thing.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.945
Job like this costs 4K.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.822
[monitor beeping]

08:09.906 --> 08:11.324
[sniffling]

08:15.786 --> 08:17.038
This is all I've got.

08:22.585 --> 08:23.920
You're shittin' me.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.468
Hold that back.

08:31.886 --> 08:32.803
[John B] Doc.

08:34.430 --> 08:35.890
Save her. Please.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.312
[school bell rings]

08:41.395 --> 08:43.731
-[JJ] Is this a game of tag?
-I don't know.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.901
Am I gonna have to beat you
with your protractor? What's going on?

08:46.984 --> 08:49.362
[whispering] Seriously, Pope,
you are driving me insane.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.697
Okay, so that guy was
from the scholarship committee.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.199
Take a look at this.

08:53.282 --> 08:54.367
Read it.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.119
[Kie] Out loud.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.124
[whispering] I can't read cursive.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.629
"Dear Mr. Heyward, I am reaching out

09:06.712 --> 09:10.216
because I have material evidence
that can exonerate John B. Routledge."

09:10.925 --> 09:13.761
"It is of vital importance
that you come and meet with me in person

09:13.844 --> 09:18.307
at my offices at 27 King Street,
Charleston at 8:00 p.m. sharp tonight."

09:19.725 --> 09:20.893
"Please come alone."

09:21.519 --> 09:23.396
"Regards, C. Limbrey."

09:24.438 --> 09:25.731
-What the--
-Charleston?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.858
It's like an eight-hour drive
plus the ferry.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.528
-How will we get there tonight?
-[JJ] We'd have to leave right now.

09:30.611 --> 09:31.654
I have a free period.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.490
"Material evidence"? What does
that even mean, "material evidence"?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.450
It means he can clear John B.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.160
Oh, shit,
then we're going to Charleston.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.662
[Kie sighs] I gotta tell my mom.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.790
Look, if we get it this time,
we are not giving it to Shoupe.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.125
[JJ] Yeah. No duh.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.134
-[sighs]
-What?

09:53.759 --> 09:57.763
I'm not sure, but I think
whoever this Limbrey person is,

09:58.848 --> 10:02.351
they might be related
to the captain of the Royal Merchant.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.109
[monitor beeping]

10:10.192 --> 10:12.695
[doctor] That was
no garden-variety extraction,

10:12.778 --> 10:14.196
I can tell you that.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.367
Okay, give me the scissors.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.455
And then get me that salty dog,
if you would, please.

10:37.386 --> 10:38.220
Perfecto.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.183
-So what happens now?
-[doctor] We wait.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.352
And we hope she wakes up.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.023
Time for a refill.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.109
We're good though, right?

10:52.193 --> 10:53.694
[doctor] Only time will tell.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.613
[Terrance grunts]

10:57.865 --> 11:00.159
Hey. Go dump the truck.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.578
-Yes, please.
-[Terrance] Go, chop-chop!

11:05.498 --> 11:07.667
-How long did I say we'd wait?
-Eight hours.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.878
Sure I ain't say minutes?

Hey, Doc. Doc! Come here!

11:48.624 --> 11:51.210
-Can you feel it?
-I feel it here but not on her wrist.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.128
[doctor sighs]

11:52.628 --> 11:53.504
Oh, shit.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.882
What do you want…
what do you want me to do? [sniffles]

11:56.966 --> 11:58.467
She's got too much fluid already.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.594
More's gonna kill her.
She should be waking up.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.513
-Hey.
-[Sarah weakly] John B.

12:02.596 --> 12:03.597
Hey, Sarah, it's me.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.560
Hang on. I gotta go get something.
I'll be right back.

12:07.643 --> 12:08.602
[Sarah weakly] Hey.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.606
-[John B] Sleepyhead.
-[doctor] It's not here.

12:12.690 --> 12:13.858
Where is it? Shit!

12:17.486 --> 12:18.320
Shit!

12:18.988 --> 12:21.490
-[Sarah] John B?
-Hey. Hey, you're okay. [sniffles]

12:21.574 --> 12:23.659
I can't feel anything.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.121
No, no, no, no, no.
You're okay. It's okay. Just listen to me.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.415
God dang! Where is this thing?

12:30.458 --> 12:32.918
[weakly] If I don't make it--

12:33.002 --> 12:35.004
[John B] Don't talk like that.
You're gonna be fine.

12:35.087 --> 12:38.883
We'll leave this creepy doctor's office,
and everything's gonna be okay.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.303
-I need you to stay with me, okay?
-[doctor] Gah!

12:45.556 --> 12:47.308

-Doc! Hey!
-[monitor flatlining]

12:50.895 --> 12:52.188
-[doctor] Do you know CPR?
-No.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.273
That's a sternum.
Push on it till I tell you to stop.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.275
-Okay.
-And try not to break her ribs.

What's wrong?

13:40.528 --> 13:41.821
What's… what's going on?

13:44.448 --> 13:45.282
What are you doing?

13:46.575 --> 13:47.409
What?

13:47.493 --> 13:48.828
[monitor beeps off]

13:48.911 --> 13:51.539
Where are you going? Help. Help me.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.083
[doctor] She's just lost
too much blood, kid.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.001
I'll leave you with her.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.721
It's okay.

[indistinct chattering on radio]

17:08.736 --> 17:09.570
It was her.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.116
That was her, right? That was Sarah.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.659
It was her. Yeah.

17:16.618 --> 17:17.453

17:20.039 --> 17:21.165
She's alive.

17:21.957 --> 17:22.791

17:24.001 --> 17:26.295
I don't know
what the hell you were doing, though,

17:27.463 --> 17:29.214
shooting a gun right at her.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.676
She's lucky you didn't hit her.
Can't be shootin' a gun--

17:32.760 --> 17:33.719
I did.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.765
-What?
-I hit her.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.272
-You shot Sarah?
-I was trying to shoot John B, okay?

17:46.231 --> 17:48.776
It was an accident.
She stepped in the way.

17:48.859 --> 17:51.028
-Is she okay?
-I did not mean to shoot her.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.363
Okay. Okay. Okay.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.281
I'm sorry.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.825
But I don't care that I did.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.079
[Ward] What did you say?

18:01.163 --> 18:04.249
-Rafe, that is your sister, okay?
-[Rafe] My sister?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.710
-Yes, your sister.
-The one who stole from us?

18:06.794 --> 18:10.172
The one who had her boyfriend
pointing a gun at us, right?

18:10.255 --> 18:12.508
-Get the blinders off.
-[Ward] You need to shut your mouth.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.593
She's gonna kill our family,
you realize that?

18:14.676 --> 18:17.262
[officer] Sorry for the wait.
We got a photo from a tourist.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.022
Is this them?

18:28.398 --> 18:29.233
That's my Sarah.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.987
She was kidnapped,
and she was brainwashed by this…

18:36.281 --> 18:40.035
He's a very disturbed individual.
He's very, very dangerous,

18:40.119 --> 18:41.245
and you can see she's hurt.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.958
Can you please find them for me?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.919
We got the plates on the truck.
We got photos.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.338
We'll get 'em and your stolen property.

18:53.048 --> 18:53.966
We'll get 'em.

[suspenseful music plays]

18:55.968 --> 18:58.720
[Anna] Baby, no, you can't go
to Charleston on a school night.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.890
But this is my chance
to finally clear John B's name!

19:01.974 --> 19:02.808
Baby--

19:02.891 --> 19:04.726
What does it mean now
to clear John B's name?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.728
-He's gone.
-[Anna] Mike.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.230
-He's gone.
-Michael!

19:08.313 --> 19:10.440
-[Mike] You have to accept it.
-Stop it!

19:12.985 --> 19:13.819
Listen to me.

19:14.570 --> 19:15.779
I understand

19:16.363 --> 19:19.867
that what you are going through
right now is incredibly difficult.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.994
-Do you?
-[Anna] Baby, I do.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.580
All we're trying to say
is that we're worried

19:24.663 --> 19:26.790
'cause you're spending
all of your time with these boys.

19:26.874 --> 19:30.210
God, Mom. They're not just
some boys that I found on the street!

19:30.294 --> 19:33.797
-I know that, Kiara. I'm not saying--
-[Kie] They're my best friends!

19:33.881 --> 19:36.592
-[Anna] I know that!
-Since kindergarten! My only friends!

19:36.675 --> 19:39.303
I understand that,
but you are not a little girl anymore!

19:39.386 --> 19:41.263
-I'm a Pogue, Mom! Sorry!
-No.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.932
[Anna] Actually, you're not, Kiara,
'cause you live on Figure Eight!

19:44.016 --> 19:45.517
Don't walk away
when I'm talking to you!

19:45.601 --> 19:48.854
I'm still one of them!
You're so worried about me being a Pogue

19:48.937 --> 19:51.190
because you got pregnant
with a Pogue, and then you had me.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.399
-Kiara.
-It was a tragedy!

19:52.482 --> 19:54.610
Kiara! Seriously? This is not fair!

19:54.693 --> 19:57.029
Stop it! Do not walk away
when I'm talking to you!

19:57.112 --> 19:58.614
Turn and look at me right now!

19:58.697 --> 20:01.325
I am so sick of this shit!

20:01.825 --> 20:05.120
Every single time that you get in trouble,
you try and stir up the pot between us,

20:05.204 --> 20:06.788
and I am not having it anymore!

20:09.750 --> 20:10.584
I'm gonna tell her.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.419
Tell her.

20:13.545 --> 20:14.546
Tell me what?

20:16.048 --> 20:18.550
-[JJ] They're taking it really well.
-[Pope] Mm-hmm.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.720
How'd you get this rig? I know
your old man didn't let you have it.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.849
I undid the intake valves
on the carburetor. Made it start pinging.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.102
And now you're just gonna take it
to your cousin Jeff's house.

20:29.186 --> 20:31.021
Just gonna get it fixed.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.648
-Crash overnight.
-Crash overnight.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.608
I think I'm rubbing off on you, Pope.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.152
Lying to your old man, stealing his truck.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.570
Kinda sounds familiar.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.114
[upbeat music playing on radio]

20:41.198 --> 20:42.991
All right, that's a sore subject. My bad.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.787
I'd say we have about 18 hours
before he absolutely loses his shit.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.414
So as long as we get it back
before then, I think we're good.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.708
-Boarding school? What?
-It's just an option.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.253
It could broaden your horizons,
baby, get you out of OBX.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.047
-I'm not going to boarding school.
-[Mike] It would give you structure.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.340
They're not my people.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.051
Look at your life right now!
Look at your life!

21:02.386 --> 21:04.263
It's good to see y'all,
Mr. and Mrs. Carrera.

21:04.346 --> 21:08.767
Hi, uh, ma'am, sir. I… I promise to have
her back at a reasonable hour and safe.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.811
-What are you doing?
-[Anna] Kiara, listen to me.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.479
You wanna go, then you can go.

21:12.562 --> 21:14.815
But if you don't come back
at the proper time,

21:14.898 --> 21:16.525
then don't come back at all!

21:17.484 --> 21:18.318
She's bluffin'.

21:22.572 --> 21:23.448
Y'all have a good day.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.538
This shit would be
so much easier without parents.

They'll be here. Just wait on 'em.

They're lookin' all over for us.
They got patrols all on State Street.

21:56.857 --> 22:00.444
[sighs] It's ten minutes to six.
We gotta get the hell outta here.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.404
-We'll settle up later.
-We said we'd wait.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.865
Look, they could be dead.
They could've been caught.

22:04.948 --> 22:08.577
Get us outta here, Stubbs.
I am not waitin' to get pinched.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.787
Just wait ten more minutes!

Uh-oh.

Cheese on bread.

22:18.378 --> 22:21.882
[Marsh] She just needs to rest
for a few minutes. She'll come around.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.472
Come in. Have a seat.

You have to be somewhere?

22:51.244 --> 22:53.497
[Marsh] Whoa, little lady!
You need to go lie down.

22:53.580 --> 22:56.333
-How long did I sleep?
-[John B] Not long enough.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.836
-Can we still make it?
-No. No. We-- It's over. Okay?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.797
-No, it's not.
-[John B] Sarah--

23:01.880 --> 23:05.050
-[Sarah] We still have an hour.
-You need to rest. You just got shot.

23:06.009 --> 23:06.968
I am fine.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.179
We're going.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.183
[John B] Sarah, you shouldn't be standing.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.101
[Sarah] I'm fine.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.144
Okay. Relax.

-[people speaking indistinctly]
-[sirens wailing]

23:20.690 --> 23:21.775
We were just walking by.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.903
-You were taking pictures, right?
-Yeah. I was there. Okay.

23:26.530 --> 23:27.406
Shit.

23:29.616 --> 23:30.575
Are you kidding me?

23:32.494 --> 23:34.204
You guys got
a little heat on you, don't you?

23:35.038 --> 23:36.665
I've been there, and I've done that.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.000
But I got an idea.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.505
Friend of the devil is a friend of mine.

23:43.588 --> 23:44.506
Thanks, Doc.

23:45.882 --> 23:46.925
-Oh dear.
-Let's go.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.844
[John B] Okay. All right.

23:49.636 --> 23:52.347
So how bad's it gonna be
when the anesthesia wears off?

23:52.431 --> 23:53.723
Pretty much mind-bending.

23:55.559 --> 23:58.186
All right, Doc,
how do I get this baby back to you?

23:58.270 --> 24:01.606
-You're just going to the wharf, right?
-Yeah. Berth 39, right?

24:01.690 --> 24:05.152
[Marsh] Perfect. Put the keys
under the gas cap, and we're good.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.237
Are you sure we can take this?

24:07.320 --> 24:10.866
Well, you overpaid for the medical,
so have a nice trip.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.451
-Thank you.
-[John B] Thanks, Doc.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.702
[engine starts]

24:21.543 --> 24:24.004
[Kie] My parents are
so paranoid of me being a Pogue,

24:24.087 --> 24:26.506
like it's the worst thing
that could ever happen.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.050
Hey, I hear they got
good weed at boarding school, though.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.802
I'm not going to boarding school.

24:31.303 --> 24:35.390
They're gonna have to kidnap me,
tie me up, and throw me in a van.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.975
Well, I say…

24:38.477 --> 24:40.979

some herb right now.

24:43.356 --> 24:46.610
Hey, Kie, have you tried
to hit John B back on that number yet?

24:46.693 --> 24:50.405
-Like, twenty million times.
-That's quite a few times. [chuckles]

24:50.489 --> 24:52.866

at a hotel keeps answering.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.869
Well, until we hear from them again,
we gotta try and clear his name.

24:55.952 --> 24:59.706
-Right now, this letter's our best bet.
-Right. Stay on task.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.750
That's why I love ya, Pope.
[clears throat]

25:02.834 --> 25:04.628
What Pope are you gonna be today?

25:06.838 --> 25:07.672
I'm good.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.549
I'm gonna try to focus.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.384
Good Pope.

25:12.093 --> 25:14.012
Boring Pope. [sighs]

25:14.513 --> 25:16.306

-[John B] Not much.

-What happened?

25:40.330 --> 25:42.666

There was a shootout. Now move along.

Well, is everybody okay?

Move on.

-[man 1] Take it easy!
-[man 2] Look out, jerk!

27:00.577 --> 27:01.745
I almost hit that person!

-[John B] Cleo?

27:17.135 --> 27:19.596

-[John B] Cleo, Cleo, Cleo.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.349
-[man 4] Don't move. We'll call somebody.
-No. Don't call the cops.

27:22.432 --> 27:23.266
Come on. Come on.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.643
-You ran me over.
-I'm so sorry.

-Where'd you get your license?
-The great state of North Carolina.

27:27.395 --> 27:29.356
-You didn't see me in the street?
-No, I didn't.

27:29.439 --> 27:30.315
Mother--

27:30.398 --> 27:33.151
Hey! How'd you make it through, girl?

27:33.234 --> 27:34.486
Are you okay?

27:34.569 --> 27:38.573
Just a scrape, you know?
I went up and over. Been through worse.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.867
-We should get outta here now.
-Okay.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.912
[tires squealing]

27:44.496 --> 27:46.873
What happened back there?
We went to the Playboy,

27:46.956 --> 27:49.084
and that place was hot!
Cops were everywhere!

27:49.167 --> 27:52.212
We were waiting for you guys to show up,
and the coppers came.

27:52.295 --> 27:55.382
They came from every direction.
I jumped overboard.

27:55.465 --> 27:58.009
-Well, what about Terrance and Stubbs?
-[Cleo] I heard gunshots.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.010
What?

27:59.094 --> 28:01.763
I ran. I wanted to shoot it out with them,
but it was too many.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.684
-Oh boy! We got company. Okay.
-[Cleo] Oh no!

28:05.767 --> 28:07.727
-Drive!
-Does it go any faster?

28:07.811 --> 28:09.813
I don't know.
The speedometer doesn't work.

Guys, I've read this thing
like a thousand times. It makes no sense.

I mean, the Limbreys own,
like, half of Charleston.

28:25.578 --> 28:29.624
What do the Kook kings of Charleston know
about a murder on Kildare Island?

28:29.708 --> 28:32.377
Why you specifically?
That's the other creepy thing.

28:32.460 --> 28:35.130
-You know?
-"Please come alone." That's hella sus.

28:35.213 --> 28:38.091
I was thinking the same thing.
I think it's because--

28:38.174 --> 28:39.634
-[steam hissing]
-Oh, come on.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.635
[Kie] What's that?

28:40.719 --> 28:43.888
Pull over. That's a lot of smoke,
even for your dad's truck.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.640
Pope, I got sensitive lungs, man!

28:46.224 --> 28:48.309
-[Pope] I'm pulling over.
-[JJ] Pope, just slow down!

28:48.393 --> 28:51.771
-What are you doing, dude?
-[Kie] Okay, sure. Yeah, right now.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.231
[Pope laughs in disbelief]

28:54.524 --> 28:55.734
[Kie] Shit!

28:55.817 --> 28:57.277
No. No. No. No.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.028
-[JJ] Oh my.
-No. No.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.906
-[Kie] It's gonna blow up.
-[JJ] No, it's not gonna blow up.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.200
You probably unhooked the radiator, Pope.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.454
I haven't seen this before.
You knocked the entire hubcap off!

29:08.663 --> 29:10.123
Whoo! [laughs]

29:10.206 --> 29:12.417
You might wanna reschedule
your meeting tonight, Pope.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.837
Plan B?
We could, um… public transportation.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.423
We could hitchhike. We could rent bikes.

29:18.506 --> 29:21.342
-[JJ] Yeah, it's the radiator.
-My dad's gonna kill me.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.969
Yeah, he might. He might.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.639
[tires squealing]

[sirens wailing]

29:34.814 --> 29:35.815
-Okay.
-[groans]

29:39.778 --> 29:41.529
[John B] You sure we're good, Cleo?

29:41.613 --> 29:44.574
Yeah, man.
We'll just wait here until it cools down.

29:44.657 --> 29:47.160
[groaning softly]

29:48.203 --> 29:49.204
You good?

29:51.247 --> 29:52.081
Fine.

29:58.797 --> 30:02.634
I'm very, very grateful. I appreciate
you guys. Thank you so much. Thank you.

30:04.385 --> 30:06.846
That's unbelievable.
It's there. It's all there.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.848
As far as I can tell,
the gold's all there.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.184
[laughing]

30:12.435 --> 30:13.520
Oh my God.

30:14.979 --> 30:18.399
They say we can go in just a second here.
I'm gonna fly it out in the morning.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.360
Until then, it's in the capable hands

30:20.443 --> 30:22.946

I know you're feeling bad,

30:36.668 --> 30:39.462
but you don't have to, okay?
I know you didn't mean to hurt her.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.966
All right? They said that they've checked
the hospitals. They checked the morgue.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.426
There's been nothing.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.053
It's good news.

30:47.136 --> 30:49.472
Means she's okay, all right?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.226
She'll come back to us.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.356
What if I'm not okay?

31:00.483 --> 31:01.776
What? I'm sorry.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.280
-I'm not okay.
-[Ward] You are. You're okay, buddy.

31:05.363 --> 31:08.157
-No, Dad, I'm not okay.
-We'll go back, get a good night's sleep.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.076
We'll get a steak or something.

31:10.159 --> 31:12.912
You're gonna feel completely different
in the morning. I know you will.

31:12.996 --> 31:16.791
-Dad, I thought I was okay, but I'm not.
-Get control. Get control of yourself.

31:16.875 --> 31:21.546
I just keep… I keep having
these, um… these thoughts in my head,

31:21.629 --> 31:24.007
and I don't…
I don't know if I can control them.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.175
And I'm just…
I'm afraid of what's gonna happen.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.803
I don't know how much more
of this shit I can take, okay?

31:28.887 --> 31:30.513
-We'll talk about it.
-I'm just afraid.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.307
We'll go back
and talk about it at the house.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.642
-I need help, okay? Not her.
-He's all right.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.061
-I need it, okay?
-I know. I know. We can talk about it.

31:37.145 --> 31:40.231
[Rafe] You're not listening.
I'm having a hard time right now.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.442
You need to man up. You need-- Look at me.

31:44.986 --> 31:47.572
Man up. Right now.

31:49.115 --> 31:50.241
Thank you.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.494
He's good.
He's just a little… It's been crazy.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.247
He was… he was out there
on the road when the whole thing happened,

31:56.331 --> 31:59.083
so he's just a little freaked out.
But he will be okay.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.336
Again, I wanna thank you guys, all right?

32:01.419 --> 32:06.132
Streets is quiet. I can get you to a boat.
You have somewhere you can hole up?

32:06.215 --> 32:09.218
Yeah, we're gonna ride

to shell up on.

but you're innocent.

-I think we should go home.
-To OBX?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.691
-[Sarah] Yes.
-What about Ward?

32:23.775 --> 32:24.984
What about Ward?

32:25.068 --> 32:27.028
He's the one
who should be running, not us.

32:27.111 --> 32:30.531
He said he would tell the truth
if we came back. I can confront him.

32:30.615 --> 32:34.827
But it's not about you confronting him.
He's completely untrustworthy.

32:35.328 --> 32:38.539
Sure. But I'm your alibi. Trust me.
