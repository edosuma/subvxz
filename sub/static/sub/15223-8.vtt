01:01.667 --> 01:02.801
Excuse me.

01:02.834 --> 01:05.567
We're looking for
Louie De Palma.

01:05.601 --> 01:08.033
Well, we got one, but ours
is in the men's room.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.434
( <i>chuckles</i> )
Can I help you?

01:09.467 --> 01:11.934
Yeah. We're with
the Immigration
Department.

01:11.968 --> 01:13.200
Oh?

01:13.234 --> 01:14.767
We're trying to find
a Latka Gravas.

01:14.801 --> 01:16.501
A Latka Gravas?

01:16.534 --> 01:20.200
Do you mind if I see
your identification?

01:20.234 --> 01:21.534
Thank you.

01:21.567 --> 01:24.767
I never heard of him.

01:24.801 --> 01:26.868
Gentlemen, we're going
to grab a cup of coffee.

01:26.901 --> 01:29.200
We'll be back in a few
minutes to see Mr. De Palma.

01:29.234 --> 01:30.601
Fine.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.601
Latka.

01:33.634 --> 01:34.868
Get out of there.

01:34.901 --> 01:37.000
Latka.

01:37.033 --> 01:40.601
What do those men from
the Immigration Department
want to see you for?

01:40.634 --> 01:41.534
They send letter.

01:41.567 --> 01:42.534
Let me see.

01:42.567 --> 01:43.734
Yeah, it's from

01:43.767 --> 01:44.934
the Immigration Department.

01:44.968 --> 01:47.667
Latka, how long ago
did you get this?

01:47.701 --> 01:48.501
Two weeks.

01:48.534 --> 01:49.868
How come you

01:49.901 --> 01:52.400
didn't have any of us
translate it for you?

01:52.434 --> 01:53.501
Did it myself.

01:53.534 --> 01:55.200
How far did
you get?

01:55.234 --> 01:56.200
"Dear Allen."

01:56.234 --> 01:57.734
That's "Alien."

02:00.534 --> 02:03.234
Latka's Student Visa
ran out a month ago.

02:03.267 --> 02:05.534
Listen to this. "If you do not
contact this office by"--

02:05.567 --> 02:07.167
that's four days ago--

02:07.200 --> 02:10.199
"a warrant will be issued
for your arrest."

02:10.234 --> 02:11.601
Uh-oh.

02:11.634 --> 02:13.801
Latka, those men were here
today to arrest you.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.467
What means "arrest"?

02:15.501 --> 02:16.501
Prison.

02:16.534 --> 02:18.634
Uh... behind bars.

02:19.734 --> 02:20.367
Jail.

02:21.634 --> 02:22.801
Police.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.634
Oh, no. I...
( <i>speaks native language</i> )

02:24.667 --> 02:26.067
Latka, Latka,
Latka, sit down.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.267
Just sit down.

02:27.300 --> 02:28.901
Latka, La...
Do you have your papers?

02:28.934 --> 02:29.901
Papers?

02:29.934 --> 02:30.901
Papers.

02:30.934 --> 02:33.501
Zigzags?

02:33.534 --> 02:35.767
No.

02:35.801 --> 02:38.501
You know, Latka,
you're in real trouble.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.400
Hey, hey, hey,
what's the big deal?

02:40.434 --> 02:41.968
The worst thing that can happen

02:42.000 --> 02:44.067
is they send you back
where you came from.

02:44.100 --> 02:47.300
You ever see any of the letters
Latka gets from his homeland?

02:47.334 --> 02:49.901
They have postage stamps
that honor barbed wire.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.334
Okay, you bozos.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.734
I cleaned all
your filthy graffiti

02:54.767 --> 02:57.000
off the walls of the can.

02:57.033 --> 02:58.801
And I want you to know

02:58.834 --> 03:02.000
what you wrote about me
in there was disgusting.

03:02.033 --> 03:03.901
Some of it ain't even true.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.000
You should see

03:05.033 --> 03:06.501
what's written
about you

03:06.534 --> 03:08.868
on the walls of
the ladies' room.

03:08.901 --> 03:10.834
I know what it says in there.

03:10.868 --> 03:12.567
I wrote it.

03:14.567 --> 03:16.200
Hey, Louie, Louie,
a couple of guys...

03:16.234 --> 03:18.367
a couple of guys came in here
looking for Latka.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.767
They said they're going to come
back and talk to you.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.634
What do they
want Latka for?

03:22.667 --> 03:24.934
They want to arrest him
as an illegal alien.

03:24.968 --> 03:26.467
So, why didn't you
just give him to them?

03:26.501 --> 03:27.934
Do I have to do everything
around here?

03:27.968 --> 03:29.300
What?

03:29.334 --> 03:30.634
Louie, we've got to help Latka.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.000
This is very serious.

03:32.033 --> 03:33.634
Serious? What's serious?
ALEX:
Hey, Louie!

03:33.667 --> 03:35.167
You're not going to
turn him in, are you?

03:35.200 --> 03:37.033
Well, I ain't lying to no feds.

03:37.067 --> 03:38.167
I can't do it.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.133
I won't do it.

03:40.167 --> 03:42.200
You can get into too much
trouble doing that.

03:42.234 --> 03:43.734
Those guys scare me.

03:43.767 --> 03:46.067
Louie, this is Latka's life
we're talking about here.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.667
If we don't
help the guy,

03:47.701 --> 03:48.868
we may lose him.

03:48.901 --> 03:50.000
So?

03:50.033 --> 03:51.400
Oh, come on, Louie.

03:51.434 --> 03:53.400
I don't want to embarrass you,

03:53.434 --> 03:56.834
but if it's anybody you
sort of love, it's Latka.

03:56.868 --> 03:58.634
Hey, John,
it's not going to work.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.634
You're laying it on
a little thick.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.267
No, he's not.

04:04.234 --> 04:07.133
Latka's the poodle
I never had.

04:07.167 --> 04:09.300
Bring on those cops!

04:09.334 --> 04:10.501
Hey!
( <i>cheering</i> )

04:10.534 --> 04:12.033
ALEX:
Get Latka outside.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.534
Come on, Latka.
Under the cab.

04:13.567 --> 04:14.601
Pretend like...

04:14.634 --> 04:15.634
Hey! They're coming.

04:15.667 --> 04:16.666
All right, all right.

04:16.701 --> 04:18.166
Just be normal.
Just be normal.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.634
JOHN:
I don't think
this is a full deck.

04:19.666 --> 04:21.733
BOBBY:
Doesn't make any difference.
They'll never know.

04:21.767 --> 04:23.868
They'll never know.
Officer!

04:23.901 --> 04:24.968
What are you doing?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.167
They like
to be called officers.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.501
Did Mr. De Palma
come back?

04:29.534 --> 04:31.100
Ah, yes, sir.
Right there.

04:31.133 --> 04:33.033
Are you Louie De Palma?

04:33.067 --> 04:34.601
Yes, I am.

04:34.634 --> 04:36.767
We're investigators
from the Department

04:36.801 --> 04:38.701
of Immigration
and Naturalization.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.033
He's under that cab.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.033
Louie!

04:41.067 --> 04:42.033
You swine!

04:42.067 --> 04:43.200
( <i>shouting</i> )

04:44.534 --> 04:46.167
Mr. Gravas?

04:46.200 --> 04:48.634
Come out, please.

05:04.234 --> 05:05.934
WOMAN:
Taxi!

05:12.667 --> 05:14.133
Fifth Avenue and...

05:14.167 --> 05:15.634
( <i>screaming</i> )

05:15.667 --> 05:18.400
I don't know that
intersection.

05:18.434 --> 05:20.601
( <i>door slams</i> )

05:22.767 --> 05:23.934
Hello.
Oh, hi, Latka.

05:23.968 --> 05:25.601
We've been looking
all over town for you.

05:25.634 --> 05:28.067
Have you been back there
the whole time?

05:28.100 --> 05:29.667
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

05:31.067 --> 05:32.300
Latka, now listen to me good,

05:32.334 --> 05:33.934
because I've been thinking
about this.

05:33.968 --> 05:36.133
I think you're just making
things worse by running.

05:36.167 --> 05:37.834
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

05:37.868 --> 05:39.167
Who told you that?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.634
( <i>speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

05:40.667 --> 05:42.467
No, I think it's
best that you
turn yourself in.

05:42.501 --> 05:43.634
( <i>speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

05:43.667 --> 05:45.400
Well, we'll try to
find a good lawyer

05:45.434 --> 05:46.501
for you that can help.

05:46.534 --> 05:47.968
( <i>speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

05:48.000 --> 05:49.667
I know, I wish there
was some other way,

05:49.701 --> 05:50.801
but I can't
think of any.

05:50.834 --> 05:51.934
Well, Latka need...

05:53.267 --> 05:55.100
"Woman."

05:55.133 --> 05:56.801
Yeah, sure, that'll take
your mind off

05:56.834 --> 05:58.467
your troubles
for a while, but, uh...

05:58.501 --> 06:01.300
No, no.
Latka need woman to...

06:01.334 --> 06:02.701
eh...

06:02.734 --> 06:04.601
to... "marry."

06:04.634 --> 06:06.901
To marry.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.267
Oh, I see.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.501
Yeah, if you marry
an American woman

06:10.534 --> 06:11.934
they won't deport you.

06:11.968 --> 06:15.000
You take tongue
right out of my mouth.

06:15.033 --> 06:18.968
So, all we have to do
is find a woman, right?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.300
Got any ideas?

06:20.334 --> 06:21.834
Phyllis George.

06:25.434 --> 06:27.567
Right. Phyllis George.

06:43.868 --> 06:45.968
Good morning, everybody.

06:48.667 --> 06:51.434
Hey, it's my pal, Latka!

06:51.467 --> 06:53.567
Hey, I knew you'd
get away, buddy!

06:53.601 --> 06:57.100
That's why I was buying you time
when the feds came in.

06:57.133 --> 06:59.234
We really put one
over on them,

06:59.267 --> 07:01.834
didn't we, pal?

07:01.868 --> 07:03.634
Hey, Latka...

07:03.667 --> 07:06.734
when's the last time
I gave you money?

07:06.767 --> 07:08.400
A long time, huh?

07:08.434 --> 07:10.067
How about if I...

07:10.100 --> 07:12.167
if I give you a buck, huh?

07:12.200 --> 07:14.501
You like that?

07:14.534 --> 07:17.634
You want to play hard ball, huh?

07:17.667 --> 07:20.267
Well, how about two bucks?

07:20.300 --> 07:22.267
How did you like that?

07:22.300 --> 07:23.701
Money talks, boys...

07:23.734 --> 07:24.834
( <i>yells</i> )

07:24.868 --> 07:27.367
What, are you crazy?

07:27.400 --> 07:28.601
Kind of wonderful, isn't it?

07:28.634 --> 07:30.400
It never occurred to him
to just drop it.

07:32.267 --> 07:33.567
Hi, guys.

07:33.601 --> 07:35.300
Hi, Elaine.
Hey, Elaine.

07:35.334 --> 07:36.901
How you doing?
How you doing?

07:36.934 --> 07:38.934
Elaine?

07:39.901 --> 07:41.367
Elaine?

07:44.200 --> 07:45.667
Elaine?

07:45.701 --> 07:46.868
Yeah?

07:55.701 --> 07:57.467
Oh, Elaine...

07:58.834 --> 08:00.868
Oh, Elaine...

08:00.901 --> 08:03.901
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

08:16.000 --> 08:17.868
Oh...

08:17.901 --> 08:21.133
That's the sweetest thing
anybody ever said to me.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.467
I think.

08:22.501 --> 08:25.434
Hey, you want to tell me
what's going on here?

08:25.467 --> 08:26.601
Well, Elaine...

08:26.634 --> 08:28.901
you were just proposed to.

08:28.934 --> 08:30.334
Aw...

08:30.367 --> 08:32.734
No, really. They won't send
Latka out of the country

08:32.767 --> 08:34.333
if he marries
an American citizen.

08:34.366 --> 08:36.000
Yeah, Elaine, what do you think?

08:36.033 --> 08:38.167
Are you guys serious? Ooh!

08:38.200 --> 08:40.133
Hey, come on, we know how you
feel, but look at it this way--

08:40.167 --> 08:42.833
it wouldn't have to be
like a real marriage.

08:42.868 --> 08:44.000
Just a paper marriage.

08:44.033 --> 08:45.367
Right.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.100
You could get
divorced soon after.
Right.

08:47.133 --> 08:49.033
I mean, you don't have
to sleep with him

08:49.067 --> 08:50.901
or anything
like that.
Who asked you?

08:54.067 --> 08:56.501
Latka, believe me, I am
very, very flattered,

08:56.534 --> 08:58.434
but I'm sorry.

08:58.467 --> 08:59.501
I can't marry you.

08:59.534 --> 09:00.834
Please?

09:00.868 --> 09:02.033
I'm sorry.

09:02.067 --> 09:03.300
Please, please?

09:03.334 --> 09:04.501
N-o.

09:04.534 --> 09:07.000
Oh, boy,
we will be so happy.

09:07.033 --> 09:08.968
No. N-o spells "no."

09:09.000 --> 09:10.634
Aw, shup.

09:12.634 --> 09:13.868
Hey, everybody!

09:13.901 --> 09:16.400
I'd like you to meet
a new friend of mine,

09:16.434 --> 09:17.501
Vivian Harrow.

09:17.534 --> 09:18.567
( <i>murmuring</i> )

09:18.601 --> 09:20.133
Vivian has agreed
to marry Latka.

09:20.167 --> 09:21.200
JOHN:
Hey, that's great!

09:21.234 --> 09:22.200
This one...

09:22.234 --> 09:23.200
I found her...

09:23.234 --> 09:24.334
Alex!
What?

09:24.367 --> 09:27.200
You can't let Latka
just marry this hooker.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.534
She's not a hooker.
She's a call girl.

09:29.567 --> 09:32.367
Look, I don't like it,
either, but it might
be our only hope.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.701
Look, it's temporary.

09:33.734 --> 09:35.901
What day is good
for you, Vivian?

09:35.934 --> 09:38.701
Well, I got part
of Thursday afternoon open.

09:38.734 --> 09:40.200
Okay, Thursday it is.
Thursday.

09:40.234 --> 09:41.200
Okay, Thursday.

09:41.234 --> 09:42.234
Okay, but remember.

09:42.267 --> 09:43.868
You said 15 minutes, I'm gone

09:43.901 --> 09:46.267
I never have to see
the guy again

09:46.300 --> 09:47.701
and no strings attached.

09:47.734 --> 09:50.234
Right. No strings.
Come here. Latka?

09:50.267 --> 09:51.734
I want you to meet Vivian.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.767
She's agreed
to be your bride.

09:55.234 --> 09:57.234
How do you do?

09:57.267 --> 09:59.400
I love you.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.701
Latka, talk to me.

10:22.734 --> 10:24.734
Latka?

10:27.934 --> 10:30.534
Latka, I'll make
you talk to me.

10:30.567 --> 10:33.701
I'll keep saying your name
until you talk to me.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.534
Latka, Latka...
Latka! Latka! Latka!

10:36.567 --> 10:37.734
Latka! Latka!
Latka! Latka...

10:37.767 --> 10:39.267
Louie! Louie! Louie,
Louie! Louie...

10:39.300 --> 10:40.567
Latka, Latka...
Louie, Louie!

10:41.968 --> 10:43.934
Louie, pull
yourself together.

10:43.968 --> 10:46.667
I don't understand
why he won't forgive me.

10:46.701 --> 10:48.968
All I did was turn him in.

10:51.667 --> 10:55.300
Hey, Latka,
the big day, huh?

10:55.334 --> 10:56.801
Hey, John, you're
a married man.

10:56.834 --> 10:58.167
Why don't you give
Latka some tips?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.167
Yeah, yeah...

10:59.200 --> 11:01.167
Well, uh... Latka,

11:01.200 --> 11:04.601
I think the most important
thing in any marriage
is communication.

11:04.634 --> 11:06.834
( <i>speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

11:08.834 --> 11:11.100
But it's not
absolutely
necessary.

11:11.133 --> 11:12.501
( <i>chuckles</i> )

11:12.534 --> 11:14.767
Hey, this is going to
be a weird wedding.

11:14.801 --> 11:17.334
The line to kiss the bride
could take a while.

11:17.367 --> 11:20.501
I hear they asked the vice squad
to give the bride away.

11:20.534 --> 11:22.300
Would you guys
just cut it out?

11:22.334 --> 11:24.167
I mean just
kindly cut it out.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.534
I mean, we could try

11:26.567 --> 11:28.801
to treat this like
a wedding, couldn't we?

11:28.834 --> 11:31.601
You know, instead
of all these locker room jokes,

11:31.634 --> 11:34.133
I think we should consider
Latka's feelings.

11:34.167 --> 11:35.534
It's not a joke to him.

11:35.567 --> 11:37.467
I love her.

11:37.501 --> 11:40.033
ELAINE:
See?

11:40.067 --> 11:41.701
So I don't know
about the rest of you,

11:41.734 --> 11:44.100
but believe me, I'm going
to try to do the most I can

11:44.133 --> 11:46.501
to make this the best wedding
two kids have ever had.

11:46.534 --> 11:48.501
She's real interesting,
this one.

11:51.534 --> 11:53.334
Hi, Latka.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.000
Hello, Vivian.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.200
Vivian!

12:02.234 --> 12:04.634
Um, how about dressing
up for the wedding?

12:04.667 --> 12:06.033
What do you think?
I plan to.

12:06.067 --> 12:07.701
Oh, you're going to
wear a white dress?

12:07.734 --> 12:09.167
A white halter.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.501
How about wearing
my wedding gown?

12:12.534 --> 12:14.033
Oh, sure, honey.

12:14.067 --> 12:18.200
I've dressed up as everything
from Pocahontas to Darth Vader.

12:18.234 --> 12:20.234
You want me in a bridal gown?

12:20.267 --> 12:21.234
You got it.

12:21.267 --> 12:22.567
Okay, great.

12:22.601 --> 12:24.901
Now all we need
is a minister.

12:24.934 --> 12:26.033
Hey, there's a minister

12:26.067 --> 12:27.667
that hangs around
down at Mario's.

12:27.701 --> 12:30.834
I'll go and see if he'll perform
the ceremony for us, all right?

12:30.868 --> 12:31.968
ELAINE:
Hey, Bobby, thanks.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
ALEX:
Good, Bobby, good.

12:33.033 --> 12:34.033
We could get flowers...

12:34.067 --> 12:35.567
Oh! Excuse me,
Immigration Officer.

12:35.601 --> 12:37.033
I'm trying to get
out of your way,

12:37.067 --> 12:38.033
Immigration Officers.

12:38.067 --> 12:39.601
Hey, Bobby. Bobby.
That's all right.

12:39.634 --> 12:40.734
You don't have
to do that.

12:40.767 --> 12:42.200
No?
Latka's going
to be okay now.

12:42.234 --> 12:44.133
Latka here is marrying
an American citizen.

12:44.167 --> 12:46.801
It's not okay if he's only doing
it to stay in this country.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.167
It's got to be
a real marriage.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.734
Oh, of course,
it's a real marriage

12:49.767 --> 12:52.100
I'm afraid we'll have
to check that out.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.300
Mr. Gravas, we're going to have
to question you.

12:54.334 --> 12:56.501
How long ago did you meet

12:56.534 --> 12:58.501
this woman
you're going to marry?

13:01.567 --> 13:03.567
"How...

13:03.601 --> 13:05.767
"How...

13:05.801 --> 13:07.133
How..."

13:07.167 --> 13:09.133
Can anybody else
answer for him?
How..."

13:09.167 --> 13:10.901
I'm up for retirement
in two years.

13:10.934 --> 13:12.968
Yeah, I can.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.100
No, let me.

13:14.133 --> 13:14.968
No, I will.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.300
No, I want to do it.
"How..."

13:16.334 --> 13:18.434
Louie, I think
it's best that I do.
No. Mr. Richards?

13:18.467 --> 13:19.734
All right, Mr. De Palma

13:19.767 --> 13:21.067
Let's have it straight.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.801
If you're lying to me,
you're committing a crime.

13:23.834 --> 13:25.567
Is this a legitimate marriage?

13:32.767 --> 13:35.434
Of course it's legitimate.

13:35.467 --> 13:37.734
It's love, I tell you.

13:37.767 --> 13:40.100
Latka's in love
with this girl,

13:40.133 --> 13:42.601
and nothing can
change his mind.

13:42.634 --> 13:44.834
Nobody could talk
to the guy.

13:44.868 --> 13:46.501
I tried to talk him out of it.

13:46.534 --> 13:50.634
I said, "Latka, she's from
the other side of the tracks.

13:50.667 --> 13:53.167
"She's classy,
and you're just a grease monkey.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.501
It'll never work out."

13:54.534 --> 13:56.634
But he doesn't care,

13:56.667 --> 13:59.133
because it's love.

14:00.901 --> 14:02.834
Her family is
totally against it.

14:02.868 --> 14:04.634
They threatened
to disown her.

14:04.667 --> 14:09.000
In fact, they even went so far
as to offer Latka $1,000

14:09.033 --> 14:13.434
to leave their daughter alone,
but he wouldn't take it.

14:15.467 --> 14:18.467
And if that isn't love,

14:18.501 --> 14:21.167
then I don't know
what is, Officer.

14:23.234 --> 14:25.234
Thanks for your
time, gentlemen.

14:25.267 --> 14:26.968
Not at all.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.934
Whoa!

14:28.968 --> 14:32.434
( <i>shouting</i> )

14:32.467 --> 14:35.267
I want none of that stuff!

14:35.300 --> 14:36.934
Oh, good...
No!

14:36.968 --> 14:38.968
Drivers touching me?

14:41.200 --> 14:44.167
I don't want
nobody touching me,

14:44.200 --> 14:45.601
except...

14:45.634 --> 14:47.667
him.

14:47.701 --> 14:49.734
Aw...

14:55.234 --> 14:56.601
Hey, Louie,

14:56.634 --> 14:58.801
that was a very nice story
you made up.

14:58.834 --> 15:00.067
You know that?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.267
You mean about the family

15:01.300 --> 15:02.968
offering money
to give up the girl?

15:03.000 --> 15:03.701
Yes.

15:03.734 --> 15:05.434
I didn't make that up.

15:05.467 --> 15:08.234
That happened to me
five years ago.

15:08.267 --> 15:10.033
Really?
That surprises me, Louie.

15:10.067 --> 15:12.133
Except I changed two things.

15:12.167 --> 15:16.334
The parents only offered me
a lousy 50 bucks.

15:16.367 --> 15:17.367
What was the other thing?

15:17.400 --> 15:19.567
I took it.

15:19.601 --> 15:22.534
( <i>murmuring</i> )

15:33.367 --> 15:34.667
ALEX:
Okay, everybody

15:34.701 --> 15:36.334
let's take
our seats now.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.667
Come on, just find
a seat anywhere.

15:38.701 --> 15:40.067
Look, the bride's people
on one side,

15:40.100 --> 15:41.300
the groom's people
on the other.

15:41.334 --> 15:43.067
I know, it makes no difference.
Just sit down.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.934
Okay, and stay there.
I think I'm
going to go...

15:44.968 --> 15:46.501
I'm going to
go check on
the bride, okay?

15:46.534 --> 15:47.701
Good, good.

15:47.734 --> 15:49.167
Latka, you ready?
All right, Latka?
Listen.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.267
You're each going to come down
from over there, all right?

15:55.734 --> 15:57.868
Hey, everybody.

15:57.901 --> 15:59.868
This is Reverend Jim, uh...

15:59.901 --> 16:01.567
Jim...?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.467
That's it.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.133
Just, uh...
Reverend Jim.

16:11.167 --> 16:13.934
Uh, uh, well, um...

16:13.968 --> 16:16.334
He's going to perform
the ceremony for us.

16:16.367 --> 16:19.801
Reverend Jim,
I'm Cabby Alex.

16:21.834 --> 16:23.133
Listen, I don't want
to be impolite

16:23.167 --> 16:24.467
but you are
a minister,
aren't you?

16:24.501 --> 16:25.968
Certainly.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.534
I was ordained in '68--
Church of the Peaceful.

16:29.567 --> 16:33.434
The church was investigated
and cleared completely.

16:33.467 --> 16:35.667
Cleared of what?

16:35.701 --> 16:38.133
Why go into it?

16:40.133 --> 16:42.467
It doesn't even exist anymore.

16:42.501 --> 16:47.501
But I assure you, I'm a minister
recognized by the state.

16:48.801 --> 16:52.133
Now, does anybody have a drink
around here?

16:55.434 --> 16:56.567
Reverend Jim...

16:56.601 --> 16:58.067
Reverend Jim, look

16:58.100 --> 17:02.100
we'd like the ceremony to be
just as brief as possible, okay?

17:02.133 --> 17:03.434
I'll do my best,

17:03.467 --> 17:05.834
but I'm kind of out of practice
at weddings.

17:05.867 --> 17:07.467
How long has it been
since you done one?

17:07.501 --> 17:10.467
Always. This is my first.

17:10.501 --> 17:13.467
Well, we'll try
to be gentle.

17:13.501 --> 17:15.666
Thank you.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.567
Okay, she's ready.

17:17.601 --> 17:19.434
Oh, good.
Latka, you ready?

17:19.467 --> 17:21.968
You know, it's too bad
we don't have any music.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.233
Well, we could always...

17:23.267 --> 17:25.901
( <i>tuneless plucking</i> )

17:25.934 --> 17:27.367
( <i>groaning</i> )

17:27.400 --> 17:28.701
BOBBY:
Hey, Louie...

17:28.734 --> 17:29.868
Hey, you know...

17:29.901 --> 17:32.033
Don't give me no guff.

17:32.067 --> 17:33.601
Geez!

17:33.634 --> 17:37.300
My mother paid good money
for these lessons,

17:37.334 --> 17:42.501
and I thought Latka should have
some music for his nuptials.

17:48.234 --> 17:51.234
( <i>playing "Because"</i> )

17:59.400 --> 18:01.234
( <i>murmuring</i> )

18:02.400 --> 18:03.701
Wow!

18:03.734 --> 18:05.701
Oh, she's beautiful.

18:05.734 --> 18:08.300
Thank you.

18:41.501 --> 18:43.501
( <i>playing off-key</i> )

18:45.100 --> 18:46.601
Louie.

19:02.868 --> 19:05.100
You are very pretty.

19:05.133 --> 19:07.133
Thank you, Latka.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.434
Um...

19:10.467 --> 19:13.601
we're gathered here today

19:13.634 --> 19:17.501
to join these two
people in marriage.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.667
The question often asked
in our time is: Why marriage?

19:25.634 --> 19:29.601
The answer is hard to see,

19:29.634 --> 19:35.000
but as obvious
as a heartbeat to feel.

19:35.033 --> 19:40.000
We marry to have
a friend, a lover.

19:40.033 --> 19:42.567
We marry to deny

19:42.601 --> 19:48.267
solitude's cold hands on us.

19:48.300 --> 19:53.767
We marry because
after all the other, uh...

19:53.801 --> 19:56.767
alternatives
have been explored,

19:56.801 --> 20:01.767
we still want to
and need to and must.

20:01.801 --> 20:05.133
I bet you all thought
I was going to screw up,

20:05.167 --> 20:06.501
didn't you?

20:16.701 --> 20:19.701
Does the couple have
anything to say?

20:21.567 --> 20:23.467
Oh, yeah, um...

20:23.501 --> 20:24.467
Latka wanted me

20:24.501 --> 20:25.968
to read you
something.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.133
He stayed up all night
going through his dictionary

20:28.167 --> 20:30.234
trying to translate what
he wanted to say to you.

20:30.267 --> 20:31.501
So, here it is.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.167
"Even though we just recently
have been formally introduced,

20:38.200 --> 20:39.968
"somehow my mind tells me

20:40.000 --> 20:42.667
that you will always be
a tart to me."

20:42.701 --> 20:44.701
"A part of me."

20:55.267 --> 20:56.934
"A part of me."

20:58.434 --> 21:02.901
"And I know, even though
we not speak same language

21:02.934 --> 21:06.868
we have the same language
of the heart."

21:18.667 --> 21:20.167
Latka...

21:23.067 --> 21:28.601
Do you take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

21:31.501 --> 21:33.834
( <i>speaking</i>
<i>in native language</i> )

21:38.067 --> 21:39.567
He does...

21:39.601 --> 21:40.734
he does.

21:47.067 --> 21:50.033
And do you, Vivian,
take this man

21:50.067 --> 21:52.400
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

21:52.434 --> 21:55.100
( <i>repeating</i>
<i>Latka's response</i> )

22:00.367 --> 22:02.934
Um... yep.

22:02.968 --> 22:05.901
This is heavy.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.501
If no man here
has any reason

22:10.534 --> 22:13.801
why these two
should not be married

22:13.834 --> 22:20.300
by the power invested in me,
I do pronounce you man and wife.

22:20.334 --> 22:22.300
You may kiss the bride.

22:22.334 --> 22:24.334
Thank you very much.

22:38.767 --> 22:41.767
( <i>whistling</i> )

22:51.300 --> 22:53.267
We will love forever.

22:53.300 --> 22:54.501
You bet, honey.

22:54.534 --> 22:56.334
Um, look,
I got to go.

22:56.367 --> 22:58.601
Um...

22:58.634 --> 23:01.701
I got an appointment
over at the Hilton
I'm late for.

23:02.868 --> 23:03.868
It was fun, huh?

23:05.667 --> 23:07.467
ALEX:
Yeah.

23:07.501 --> 23:09.367
Thanks, guys.

23:10.767 --> 23:12.501
Ah, you...

23:12.534 --> 23:14.200
Hey, Latka...

23:15.734 --> 23:18.467
Latka, don't take it
so bad, huh?

23:18.501 --> 23:19.934
JOHN:
Yeah, don't worry, Latka.

23:19.968 --> 23:22.400
There'll be somebody else.
You'll see.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.000
I said we shouldn't
have done this.

23:24.033 --> 23:25.601
Wait. Latka wants
to say something.

23:25.634 --> 23:26.667
What is it, Latka?

23:26.701 --> 23:28.701
No honeymoon?

23:31.367 --> 23:32.801
No honeymoon.

23:34.934 --> 23:38.667
Boy, America's a tough town.
