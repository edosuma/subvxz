00:33.376 --> 00:36.847
Years ago, I was scheduled
to go on a vacation.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.616
First one I was going on

00:39.583 --> 00:42.452
since my dad passed.

00:45.321 --> 00:47.825
I was reluctant to go because my
business

00:47.858 --> 00:49.359
needed my attention.

00:50.761 --> 00:54.230
But I agreed to go

00:54.263 --> 00:56.165
because my family demanded it.

01:01.437 --> 01:06.175
But I wasn't prepared

01:06.209 --> 01:08.779
for what was to happen
just before we left.

01:26.462 --> 01:29.365
Today, I'm
scheduled to go on vacation.

01:30.333 --> 01:32.770
The first one I'm taking
since my dad passed.

01:33.937 --> 01:36.774
I'm reluctant to go because
Stoneware App Development

01:36.807 --> 01:37.908
needs my attention.

01:39.843 --> 01:41.912
Stoneware used to be my father's
company.

01:43.647 --> 01:46.282
It will always belong to him.

01:46.315 --> 01:49.687
But now ownership is split
between my mother, myself,

01:49.720 --> 01:50.988
Back off.

01:51.021 --> 01:53.256
And Richie
Howell.

01:53.289 --> 01:55.859
You do realize you just broke
into my property, don't you?

01:56.994 --> 01:59.495
Do I have the right to defend
myself?

01:59.529 --> 02:00.597
I trusted you.

02:03.533 --> 02:05.568
Don't you see I'm
trying to save this place?

02:06.536 --> 02:08.939
I mean you wanna keep your
precious little Ma and Pa?

02:08.972 --> 02:11.441
Wake up and smell the coffee,
Mia.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.745
You either sell now or you dry
up

02:14.778 --> 02:16.312
and vanish into oblivion!

02:17.513 --> 02:18.514
But not me, no.

02:21.051 --> 02:22.653
No I'm thinking of the future.

02:24.054 --> 02:25.555
And you're not a part of it.

02:35.231 --> 02:36.566
But I
could have never prepared

02:36.600 --> 02:38.869
for what happened just before we
left.

04:06.824 --> 04:08.926
I don't know why I try
to go back to sleep.

04:09.827 --> 04:12.729
I think I inherited
restlessness from my father.

04:14.397 --> 04:16.700
When I was a kid, he woke
up before the sun came up

04:16.733 --> 04:18.635
and left before we ever even saw
him.

04:24.708 --> 04:26.610
He rarely stopped to take a
vacation.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.880
Even when he did, he
brought his work with him.

04:32.850 --> 04:35.686
I started working for
him right out of college.

04:35.719 --> 04:37.588
That's what happens when
you switch your major

04:37.621 --> 04:41.091
three times and graduate with
a degree in communications.

04:41.124 --> 04:44.828
But it was probably the
closest we'd ever been.

04:44.862 --> 04:47.563
I finally had a relationship
with him,

04:47.598 --> 04:50.667
kind of like an ongoing
take your child to work day.

04:51.835 --> 04:53.604
He taught me a lot.

04:53.637 --> 04:55.504
He taught me that a great
company

04:55.538 --> 04:57.540
is built on loyalty.

04:57.573 --> 05:01.444
That's not some insincere,
overused company motto.

05:01.477 --> 05:05.115
My father knew loyal people
are the real treasure.

05:05.148 --> 05:07.951
He would buy coffee for his
employees every morning.

05:07.985 --> 05:11.121
Whatever they wanted from
Marie Catrib's Cafe, they got.

05:12.089 --> 05:13.223
He'd even buy me my fave,

05:13.257 --> 05:16.627
double skim latte with two
pumps of sugar-free caramel.

05:16.660 --> 05:19.562
He never forgot, and neither did
I.

05:19.596 --> 05:20.931
Miss Mia.

05:20.964 --> 05:22.099
Oh ho, thank ya.

05:22.132 --> 05:23.033
Oh you never forget.

05:23.066 --> 05:24.067
Here you go.

05:24.101 --> 05:26.103
Don't you drink my coffee, Mo.

05:26.136 --> 05:27.170
Yeah right.

05:27.204 --> 05:28.038
Where's my coffee, huh?

05:28.071 --> 05:30.506
Oh Richie, I could have sworn
I heard

05:30.539 --> 05:31.742
my six year old daughter.

05:31.775 --> 05:34.477
How much money have you wasted
on those people, seriously?

05:35.411 --> 05:37.648
You get to misappropriate
funds, and so do I.

05:37.681 --> 05:39.883
Coffee and liquor are
two different expenses.

05:39.917 --> 05:41.785
Hey, I handle the
expenses here, partner.

05:43.954 --> 05:44.855
Last day.

05:44.888 --> 05:45.989
Last day?

05:46.023 --> 05:47.157
Before your vacation.

05:47.190 --> 05:48.859
Oh, right.

05:48.892 --> 05:51.028
Wow, glad I reminded you.

05:51.061 --> 05:52.029
I spent a lot on those
reservations.

05:52.062 --> 05:52.996
Yeah, thanks.

05:53.030 --> 05:55.699
You haven't reminded me enough.

05:55.732 --> 05:56.633
Apparently not.

05:57.834 --> 05:59.502
I got that.

05:59.535 --> 06:01.972
Did you have Benny
wrap up that Park contract?

06:02.005 --> 06:03.006
It's in my office.

06:04.708 --> 06:05.574
What?

06:08.045 --> 06:09.012
Mhmm.

06:09.046 --> 06:10.213
Thanks, Mia, good morning.

06:10.247 --> 06:11.982
Good morning.

06:12.015 --> 06:14.017
Welcome to
Stoneware.

06:14.051 --> 06:15.986
Chris Park wants to move the
app meeting

06:16.019 --> 06:16.920
up to 10:30.

06:16.954 --> 06:17.788
10:30?

06:17.821 --> 06:18.622
What time is it?

06:18.655 --> 06:19.589
8:04.

06:19.623 --> 06:20.489
Shoot.

06:21.158 --> 06:22.793
It's crazy
here.

06:22.826 --> 06:24.127
Can you make sure that
projector's working?

06:24.161 --> 06:26.129
It kept stalling the other day.

06:26.163 --> 06:27.164
Do you want coffee?

06:27.197 --> 06:28.531
Drank some already today.

06:28.564 --> 06:29.933
So, yes.

06:31.101 --> 06:32.102
You can have mine.

06:33.203 --> 06:34.037
The truth is,
Louisa's

06:34.071 --> 06:36.073
always been the company's
heartbeat.

06:37.140 --> 06:40.010
So every benefit is
represented

06:40.043 --> 06:42.545
by eye-catching imagery
so that the consumer...

06:42.579 --> 06:43.512
Here it is.

06:43.546 --> 06:44.948
It's ready.

06:44.982 --> 06:45.916
Once you sign it.

06:52.022 --> 06:54.825
Mia, it's not an Apple
Conference.

06:54.858 --> 06:57.560
It's a small deal, just keep it
personal.

06:57.594 --> 06:59.863
Thank you, I think I know
how to give a presentation.

06:59.896 --> 07:01.564
Not a doubt in my
mind.

07:03.266 --> 07:06.236
Every benefit is captured by

07:06.269 --> 07:08.171
eye-catching imagery.

07:08.205 --> 07:10.573
Like this one right here for
example.

07:10.607 --> 07:14.611
So your app doesn't bog
people down with information.

07:14.644 --> 07:17.546
It shows more when they wanna
know more.

07:17.581 --> 07:18.849
Yeah, yeah.

07:18.882 --> 07:20.951
I can see it, but,

07:20.984 --> 07:22.652
I don't know.

07:22.686 --> 07:25.122
I mean when we met with Meta,

07:25.155 --> 07:26.590
they gave us a great option

07:26.623 --> 07:28.258
to track customer satisfaction.

07:28.291 --> 07:29.860
Do you have anything like that?

07:34.331 --> 07:37.167
So much for
my degree in communications.

07:39.302 --> 07:40.804
We need to think about it.

07:58.855 --> 08:00.657
Customer satisfaction?

08:02.192 --> 08:04.961
Customer satisfaction, I
mean you know, you have that.

08:06.163 --> 08:07.597
So does everybody else.

08:08.564 --> 08:10.767
Why do you think people
deck themselves out

08:10.801 --> 08:11.935
in Nike head to toe?

08:11.968 --> 08:13.336
Customer satisfaction?

08:14.838 --> 08:17.707
This layout is about loyalty to
the values

08:17.741 --> 08:19.242
of Park Insurance.

08:19.276 --> 08:20.877
It doesn't just sign people up,

08:20.911 --> 08:23.080
it keeps them signed up
because they wanna feel

08:23.113 --> 08:24.714
like they're a part of
something.

08:25.615 --> 08:28.985
Customer satisfaction, that's
worthless.

08:29.019 --> 08:32.121
Customer loyalty, that's
priceless.

08:49.439 --> 08:50.307
Sounds great.

08:51.208 --> 08:52.209
Thank you.

08:52.242 --> 08:53.376
I think you're gonna like it.

08:53.410 --> 08:55.011
I agree.

08:55.045 --> 08:56.113
Thank you very much.

08:56.146 --> 08:58.181
Like I
said, Stoneware's heartbeat.

08:58.215 --> 09:00.217
You have an updated contract?

09:00.250 --> 09:01.985
You'll have it first thing
tomorrow.

09:03.386 --> 09:04.421
Seriously?

09:04.454 --> 09:06.289
Okay, sure.

09:06.323 --> 09:06.990
All right.

09:07.023 --> 09:08.725
Hey, keep up the good work.

09:08.758 --> 09:09.392
Of course.

09:09.426 --> 09:10.293
Take care.

09:14.464 --> 09:16.867
What was that about?

09:16.900 --> 09:17.567
What?

09:17.602 --> 09:19.102
First thing in the morning?

09:19.136 --> 09:21.271
You have the contract signed and
ready.

09:21.304 --> 09:22.372
No, no, no, no, look.

09:22.405 --> 09:23.940
We gotta punch it up.

09:23.974 --> 09:24.875
He said he was talking to Meta.

09:24.908 --> 09:27.444
What, he said yes, as in yes

09:27.477 --> 09:30.680
I wanna sign the contract.

09:30.714 --> 09:31.381
Wait.

09:32.949 --> 09:35.085
You don't have the
updated contract, do you?

09:37.254 --> 09:38.722
You didn't get it back from
Benny

09:38.755 --> 09:40.390
because you were late!

09:40.423 --> 09:42.459
No, no, no, look, it's not
like that.

09:42.492 --> 09:43.360
- I got this.
- Show it to me.

09:43.393 --> 09:44.427
Show it to me then.

09:44.461 --> 09:47.197
All right, fine, okay?

09:48.798 --> 09:50.133
Just cut me some slack here.

09:51.001 --> 09:53.870
In five years, when have I lost
a client?

09:53.904 --> 09:54.871
Am I not reliable?

09:54.905 --> 09:56.072
Tell me I'm not reliable.

09:56.106 --> 09:57.440
You're not reliable.

09:57.474 --> 09:59.442
I got them in the room!

09:59.476 --> 10:01.978
I've locked down three
new clients this quarter.

10:02.879 --> 10:05.248
And I got you and your
hubby those tickets.

10:05.282 --> 10:06.149
Remember?

10:08.118 --> 10:10.420
You are something else.

10:10.453 --> 10:14.024
My father's
legacy lives another day.

10:14.057 --> 10:14.925
I think.

10:16.259 --> 10:18.195
What's it like being
out of the office, huh?

10:18.228 --> 10:20.964
Little lake time, family and
friends?

10:20.997 --> 10:23.400
It's a sad reminder
that my friends and family

10:23.433 --> 10:26.469
and my coworkers are the same
people.

10:26.503 --> 10:27.337
Think fast.

10:27.370 --> 10:28.305
Ooh.

10:28.338 --> 10:29.105
Well Dad, do you want me

10:29.139 --> 10:31.141
to look over the Kendall
agreement?

10:31.174 --> 10:33.343
You know she brought the
paperwork, did you Mia?

10:33.376 --> 10:34.444
Come on, you're on vacation.

10:34.477 --> 10:36.413
You should be analyzing
the inside of your eyelids.

10:36.446 --> 10:37.314
Mmm.

10:38.248 --> 10:39.115
Or my lips.

10:39.149 --> 10:40.383
You can analyze those too.

10:42.552 --> 10:43.186
Ooh.

10:43.220 --> 10:44.454
Oh come on, don't get it.

10:44.487 --> 10:46.356
Speak of the devil.

10:46.389 --> 10:47.257
Better answer.

10:50.327 --> 10:51.194
Mia Stone.

10:52.562 --> 10:54.297
Yeah, yeah Jason, yeah.

10:55.832 --> 10:57.300
Yeah, let me just call you back
in 10

10:57.334 --> 10:59.469
when I have it in front of me.

10:59.502 --> 11:00.804
Okay thanks, bye.

11:00.837 --> 11:01.471
Told you.

11:01.504 --> 11:02.973
Sorry.

11:03.006 --> 11:05.308
Mia, he's not going anywhere.

11:05.342 --> 11:06.376
Hey, I'll be right back.

11:06.409 --> 11:07.744
You guys do your thing.

11:09.145 --> 11:10.146
Come on, let's go.

11:34.904 --> 11:36.273
Come back!

11:37.374 --> 11:40.343
That was
the last time I saw him.

11:40.377 --> 11:43.780
It was the first vacation
he took in 22 years.

12:11.474 --> 12:14.244
Hey, honey, what are you doing
up?

12:15.879 --> 12:16.580
You hungry?

12:19.215 --> 12:23.153
You want some toast or cheese?

12:23.186 --> 12:25.889
Yeah.

12:25.922 --> 12:27.190
Do you have to go to work?

12:28.425 --> 12:30.560
I am just gonna take
care of a couple things

12:30.594 --> 12:32.095
and I'll be right back.

12:32.128 --> 12:33.563
We're supposed
to have tea later.

12:33.597 --> 12:35.165
Can you make that?

12:35.198 --> 12:36.066
Of course.

12:39.269 --> 12:40.136
Hey babe.

12:42.205 --> 12:43.073
Hey.

12:51.047 --> 12:51.915
Pancakes?

13:05.028 --> 13:05.895
Dang it!

13:07.297 --> 13:09.032
Can't I get a break?

13:19.042 --> 13:20.543
All right lady, wake up!

13:21.544 --> 13:23.113
Let's go, let's get out of here!

13:23.146 --> 13:24.314
Holy crap, holy crap.

13:24.347 --> 13:25.181
Let's go.

13:25.215 --> 13:26.049
Holy crap.

13:26.082 --> 13:27.317
Just take my money, just take my
money!

13:27.350 --> 13:29.018
I don't need your money.

13:29.052 --> 13:30.286
I got money.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.521
Now let's get outta here!

13:31.554 --> 13:33.189
No, just take my car and let
me go.

13:33.223 --> 13:34.023
Not a chance.

13:34.057 --> 13:36.226
We're in this together, all
right?

13:36.259 --> 13:39.462
Now put this car in gear
and let's get out of here

13:39.496 --> 13:41.431
or we'll both gonna be in the
slammer!

13:59.482 --> 14:02.051
Look, I don't know what you
want from me

14:02.085 --> 14:06.256
or what I did to upset you, but,

14:06.289 --> 14:07.991
I have a little girl.

14:08.024 --> 14:09.993
And all I wanna do is see her
again.

14:11.094 --> 14:14.598
And I'm sure all she wants
to do is see you again.

14:14.632 --> 14:16.332
Now you do exactly as I say

14:17.333 --> 14:19.936
and we'll get you home
in time for tea party.

14:25.743 --> 14:27.343
Can you at least tell
me where we're going?

14:27.377 --> 14:28.411
Right here.

14:28.445 --> 14:29.279
Here?

14:29.312 --> 14:30.213
- Right?
- Right here.

14:41.291 --> 14:42.693
We're here.

14:42.726 --> 14:44.160
Bring that bag of cash in.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.294
Actually it's that way.

15:38.181 --> 15:40.149
Put that right there on the
coffee table.

15:45.555 --> 15:46.523
Don't worry about that.

15:46.556 --> 15:47.591
I applaud the effort.

16:34.270 --> 16:35.471
It's not for you to see.

16:39.309 --> 16:40.376
At least, not yet.

16:41.645 --> 16:42.512
But this is.

16:43.346 --> 16:46.650
I figured since I pulled
you out of the cafe,

16:46.684 --> 16:50.219
the least I could do is coffee.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.462
Oh, oh no, don't worry, no.

17:00.664 --> 17:02.265
No mickey slippy here.

17:02.967 --> 17:04.602
It's just hot Colombian coffee.

17:09.906 --> 17:10.773
Mmm.

17:14.310 --> 17:15.713
Oh, sorry.

17:15.746 --> 17:16.847
Cream?

17:16.880 --> 17:17.748
Oh no, no, no, no.

17:17.781 --> 17:19.115
Here, here, here, wait.

17:22.285 --> 17:23.152
It's cream.

17:24.821 --> 17:25.689
I'm sorry.

17:26.422 --> 17:28.223
I can be a little weird
sometimes.

17:32.195 --> 17:34.598
Why do you have a
notebook with my name on it?

17:36.900 --> 17:37.768
You saw that.

17:40.470 --> 17:41.772
Are you stalking me?

17:42.973 --> 17:44.240
Stalking?

17:45.876 --> 17:47.276
That's a bit harsh.

17:48.211 --> 17:49.613
I've been watching.

17:49.647 --> 17:52.750
I've been observing you,

17:53.951 --> 17:55.653
kind of following.

17:55.686 --> 17:57.688
Yeah I guess you could say I was
stalking.

17:58.989 --> 18:00.858
Listen, I don't know
what you want from me

18:00.891 --> 18:02.291
or what you're gonna do

18:02.325 --> 18:04.394
but you don't have to do it.

18:05.561 --> 18:07.230
You can take this back.

18:07.263 --> 18:09.600
You can drop it off, you can
drive away.

18:09.633 --> 18:11.534
I won't tell a soul.

18:11.567 --> 18:12.903
As long as you let me go.

18:13.871 --> 18:14.537
You've got a choice.

18:14.570 --> 18:16.740
You can make the right decision.

18:17.808 --> 18:19.409
Starting now.

18:19.442 --> 18:20.844
It's not too late.

18:23.681 --> 18:26.650
You know,

18:26.684 --> 18:28.986
look out, I wish you were right.

18:29.019 --> 18:32.522
But, I'm kind of stuck in the
past.

18:33.222 --> 18:35.826
You see Mia, you and I
aren't that different.

18:37.828 --> 18:40.363
You know years ago, I was
scheduled to go

18:40.396 --> 18:41.531
on a vacation.

18:41.564 --> 18:44.735
The first one since my dad had
passed.

18:45.636 --> 18:50.540
But I wasn't prepared
for what was to happen

18:50.573 --> 18:52.341
just before we left.

18:58.882 --> 19:01.250
You know, I loved my mother.

19:02.418 --> 19:05.254
She was a great woman, a kind
woman.

19:05.288 --> 19:07.658
Always gave people the
benefit of the doubt.

19:07.691 --> 19:09.459
And she was a great cook.

19:10.961 --> 19:12.896
She sounds like a great woman.

19:15.531 --> 19:16.734
She was hit by a truck.

19:18.969 --> 19:21.370
She was on her way to meet a old
friend

19:21.404 --> 19:24.708
at her favorite cafe, Marie
Catrib's.

19:24.742 --> 19:29.545
Actually, ever been there?

19:29.580 --> 19:30.981
It's probably better that way.

19:32.515 --> 19:34.417
She didn't have to see the
family business

19:34.450 --> 19:35.819
get ripped off by a friend

19:35.853 --> 19:37.788
that we trusted for years.

19:37.821 --> 19:40.924
Something to do with share
redemption or something,

19:40.958 --> 19:42.025
I don't know.

19:42.826 --> 19:44.995
It was a lot of internal
corruption.

19:45.028 --> 19:48.364
That's an awful story, but,

19:52.836 --> 19:53.837
Are you all right?

19:56.405 --> 19:58.441
All of a sudden, you don't look
too good.

20:00.711 --> 20:02.079
You want some more coffee?

20:18.494 --> 20:22.599
Okay.

20:28.504 --> 20:29.773
After waking
up,

20:29.807 --> 20:32.542
I felt like I was in the
twilight zone.

20:34.678 --> 20:35.545
Mo?

20:36.814 --> 20:38.481
Was that real?

20:39.716 --> 20:40.684
Is this real?

20:42.518 --> 20:44.888
No Mo, no Leanne.

20:46.489 --> 20:47.624
What about Luisa?

20:51.829 --> 20:53.563
Miss Mia.

20:53.597 --> 20:55.132
Didn't expect to see you today.

20:55.165 --> 20:56.332
Yeah, I,

20:57.167 --> 20:58.769
where's Luisa?

20:58.802 --> 21:00.503
I think you told her
to take the day off,

21:00.536 --> 21:01.638
if I recall correctly.

21:02.673 --> 21:05.676
Oh, right, right.

21:05.709 --> 21:06.944
Are you okay?

21:06.977 --> 21:09.146
Should I call Luisa to come in?

21:09.179 --> 21:10.814
Oh no, no, I can.

21:10.848 --> 21:12.583
Amanda's here,

21:12.616 --> 21:15.451
which is hardly comforting.

21:15.484 --> 21:17.386
But if she's here,

21:17.420 --> 21:19.388
then I can bet someone else is
too.

21:24.862 --> 21:26.597
What are you doing
here?

21:26.630 --> 21:27.731
Yup.

21:27.764 --> 21:29.166
You're supposed to be on
vacation, you workaholic.

21:29.199 --> 21:31.500
Did you get Chris Park that
contract?

21:32.568 --> 21:33.937
Are you serious, Mia?

21:33.971 --> 21:34.872
I mean can you keep your little
fingers

21:34.905 --> 21:36.039
out of just one thing, please?

21:36.073 --> 21:38.008
Do not turn this back on me.

21:38.041 --> 21:39.610
You said first thing.

21:39.643 --> 21:40.978
He doesn't have it, does he?

21:43.013 --> 21:46.183
I can't afford to
lose another potential client.

21:46.216 --> 21:48.151
You mean lose another client
to Meta.

21:52.122 --> 21:54.992
Hey, hold on a second,
where are you going?

21:55.025 --> 21:56.660
Benny's, I can do it myself.

21:56.693 --> 21:57.928
No.

21:57.961 --> 21:59.562
Okay, I'm sorry.

22:01.131 --> 22:02.498
I'm sorry.

22:02.531 --> 22:05.702
I'm just worried about you is
all.

22:05.736 --> 22:07.070
You're going a million miles an
hour

22:07.104 --> 22:09.006
and you're supposed to be on
vacation.

22:09.039 --> 22:10.573
I got you two weeks at the Royal
Crown,

22:10.607 --> 22:12.075
you've already cut that in half.

22:13.043 --> 22:14.044
If you do your job,

22:14.077 --> 22:16.713
You need to learn how to
relax.

22:16.747 --> 22:18.215
I'm waiting to hear back from
Benny.

22:18.248 --> 22:19.548
Go home.

22:20.951 --> 22:22.653
I'll call him and put the heat
on

22:22.686 --> 22:26.189
and then I'll CC you when I
send it to Chris in two hours.

22:26.223 --> 22:27.490
Okay?

22:27.523 --> 22:29.826
Just promise me you'll leave.

22:32.696 --> 22:34.064
Okay.

22:34.097 --> 22:35.098
Okay.

22:35.132 --> 22:35.999
Hey.

22:37.234 --> 22:39.036
You're going home.

22:39.069 --> 22:41.071
Yeah, just give me a minute.

23:18.976 --> 23:20.577
This
isn't about a contract

23:20.610 --> 23:21.845
or even a company.

23:23.180 --> 23:24.547
It's about a legacy.

23:26.783 --> 23:27.651
A family.

23:44.001 --> 23:46.303
Benny Silverman has been the
family lawyer

23:46.336 --> 23:48.839
since before Stoneware existed.

23:48.872 --> 23:50.073
He runs a slew of companies

23:50.107 --> 23:51.742
with the help of his son Jacob.

23:55.645 --> 23:57.047
Hey Jacob?

23:57.080 --> 23:58.181
Is your dad here?

23:58.215 --> 23:59.082
Oh, hey.

24:02.019 --> 24:04.321
Yeah he's in his office.

24:04.354 --> 24:05.288
Could I see him?

24:06.957 --> 24:07.824
Dad?

24:08.925 --> 24:10.327
Yeah, what?

24:10.360 --> 24:12.729
It's on, oh hey!

24:12.763 --> 24:13.730
Hey, Benny.

24:15.232 --> 24:16.767
What can I do for you,
sweetheart?

24:16.800 --> 24:18.969
Oh, I need to wrap up
that deal with Chris Park

24:19.002 --> 24:20.837
but Richie didn't send you
the finalized agreement

24:20.871 --> 24:22.239
so here I am.

24:22.272 --> 24:23.572
What deal?

24:23.607 --> 24:25.342
With Chris Park, with Park
Insurance.

24:25.375 --> 24:26.977
I don't know what you're
talking about.

24:27.010 --> 24:28.345
Really?

24:28.378 --> 24:31.615
He didn't send over the
preliminary agreement?

24:31.648 --> 24:32.315
Afraid not.

24:34.151 --> 24:36.920
You know, I never liked
that kid, no offense.

24:38.922 --> 24:41.892
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be in the Caribbean?

24:41.925 --> 24:44.194
Yeah, that was supposed
to be this week and next

24:44.227 --> 24:46.229
but you know what two
weeks at an all inclusive

24:46.263 --> 24:48.832
tropical resort does for you.

24:48.865 --> 24:50.667
I come back looking like a
golden brown

24:50.700 --> 24:52.102
jet puffed marshmallow.

24:53.136 --> 24:54.671
So we're leaving tomorrow.

24:54.704 --> 24:57.607
Well I wish I'd received a
contract

24:57.641 --> 24:58.341
to finish up for you

24:58.375 --> 24:59.776
but I'm afraid I didn't.

25:05.849 --> 25:09.152
You know what, I was wondering
if you could take a look

25:09.186 --> 25:11.254
into that partnership
agreement for Stoneware.

25:11.288 --> 25:13.223
You wanna buy him out?

25:13.256 --> 25:15.659
No it would take a real ice
queen

25:15.692 --> 25:17.861
to Spartan kick him out
of the company, but,

25:18.862 --> 25:21.998
You're a loyal partner,
just like your father.

25:22.732 --> 25:26.770
You know, you'd have a hard
time buying him out anyway

25:26.803 --> 25:28.738
because your dad really
knew how to draw up

25:28.772 --> 25:30.307
a partnership agreement.

25:30.340 --> 25:31.174
Really?

25:31.208 --> 25:32.242
Yeah.

25:32.275 --> 25:35.879
He drafted something he
called the loyalty clause

25:35.912 --> 25:40.016
which makes your buyout offer an
agreement

25:40.050 --> 25:43.220
to be bought out up to five
years later

25:43.253 --> 25:44.721
for that same amount.

25:46.022 --> 25:46.890
Wait, what?

25:49.059 --> 25:49.926
So.

25:52.329 --> 25:55.432
Let's say at the start of this
contract,

25:55.465 --> 25:58.201
the little dick goes and blows
all of his money and assets

25:58.235 --> 26:01.404
on things that stay in Vegas.

26:01.438 --> 26:02.672
Sounds like Richie.

26:03.406 --> 26:06.376
He has to sell his shares for
a meal.

26:06.409 --> 26:08.178
And you're there on your high
horse

26:08.211 --> 26:12.048
to buy him out for peanuts.

26:12.082 --> 26:12.916
Hmm.

26:12.949 --> 26:13.850
But guess what.

26:14.718 --> 26:15.485
What?

26:15.519 --> 26:17.287
Four years and 11 months
later,

26:17.320 --> 26:20.390
Kevin took your kid and
kicks you out of the house

26:20.423 --> 26:21.825
and you're on the street.

26:22.559 --> 26:26.429
You have to sell your
shares back to Richie.

26:26.463 --> 26:27.330
Thanks.

26:28.331 --> 26:29.799
Guess for how much.

26:47.017 --> 26:48.285
Peanuts?

26:48.318 --> 26:49.386
Peanuts!

26:51.488 --> 26:53.957
Yeah, yeah, okay.

26:53.990 --> 26:56.226
Thanks, that's great Benny.

26:56.259 --> 26:57.394
Thou shall not lowball

26:57.427 --> 26:59.396
lest you be lowballed yourself.

26:59.429 --> 27:00.830
Noted, got it.

27:01.666 --> 27:04.501
Anyway, yeah, I'll take
a look at it for you.

27:04.534 --> 27:06.169
Okay, thanks, Benny.

27:06.203 --> 27:07.137
No problem.

27:07.170 --> 27:09.139
I live for this stuff.

27:09.172 --> 27:10.907
And a good ear of corn.

27:10.941 --> 27:11.808
Want some?

27:13.276 --> 27:15.078
No, never mind.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.012
Thanks.

27:16.046 --> 27:17.814
Don't worry about it, I'm sure
it's fine.

27:17.847 --> 27:18.915
Thanks, Benny.

27:18.949 --> 27:19.816
Sure!

27:21.451 --> 27:22.319
Mia.

27:26.957 --> 27:28.758
There's something I wanna show
you.

27:50.581 --> 27:51.781
It's up this way.

27:51.815 --> 27:52.882
Okay.

27:57.554 --> 28:02.759
This here is a 1994 Four
Winds recreational vehicle

28:03.460 --> 28:06.296
refurbished and ready to hit the
road.

28:06.329 --> 28:08.198
Looks great, Benny.

28:08.231 --> 28:09.099
Yeah.

28:10.433 --> 28:11.468
It was your father's.

28:12.469 --> 28:13.403
He bought it as a clunker

28:13.436 --> 28:16.406
and then asked me and Jacob to
fix her up.

28:18.942 --> 28:20.377
Then he passed away.

28:23.313 --> 28:25.882
I just thought I'd patch her up
anyway.

28:29.486 --> 28:33.023
You know, he really did change
there

28:33.056 --> 28:34.791
in those last few months.

28:36.359 --> 28:38.028
I'm not sure why.

28:38.061 --> 28:40.196
I mean who would have ever
thought of Donald Stone

28:40.230 --> 28:42.332
as a boating kind of a guy
anyway?

28:45.502 --> 28:48.438
I really think he just wished

28:48.471 --> 28:50.240
for the two of you to spend more
time

28:50.273 --> 28:51.975
out of the office together.

28:54.578 --> 28:55.445
Benny.

28:57.447 --> 28:58.548
I had this dream.

29:00.950 --> 29:04.454
I passed out in my car in
front of Marie Catrib's today.

29:05.522 --> 29:06.624
Really?

29:06.657 --> 29:08.158
Getting much sleep?

29:08.191 --> 29:09.459
Right?

29:09.492 --> 29:11.161
And I had this dream where this
old man

29:11.194 --> 29:14.064
kidnapped me, he had this big
bag of cash

29:14.097 --> 29:16.900
and he took me to his house

29:16.933 --> 29:19.436
and he drugged me with a cup of
coffee.

29:21.471 --> 29:23.039
Uh huh, what happened next?

29:24.174 --> 29:25.576
And then he told me this story

29:25.609 --> 29:29.580
about how he went on
vacation and lost everything

29:29.613 --> 29:30.880
in the same week.

29:32.182 --> 29:34.652
He lost his company, he lost his
family.

29:34.685 --> 29:37.420
I think maybe you've
been under a lot of stress.

29:40.123 --> 29:42.459
But it was so real.

29:42.492 --> 29:45.161
I know what his house smelled
like.

29:45.195 --> 29:47.130
I know how the cup of coffee
tasted.

29:47.832 --> 29:50.333
It was the worst coffee
I'd ever had in my life.

29:52.135 --> 29:55.004
Then I just, I suddenly woke up.

29:57.307 --> 29:58.174
So.

29:59.242 --> 30:02.412
Maybe this old man with a bag of
cash

30:02.445 --> 30:05.915
really drugged you and then
drove you back

30:05.949 --> 30:08.952
to Marie Catrib's.

30:08.985 --> 30:10.253
I know, it's ridiculous.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.389
- It's crazy.
- No it isn't.

30:12.422 --> 30:14.491
It's really very telling.

30:14.524 --> 30:17.026
Maybe this is your
subconscious talking to you.

30:18.294 --> 30:19.295
What's it saying?

30:20.463 --> 30:22.031
What's it asking of you?

30:31.975 --> 30:32.643
Hey.

30:34.578 --> 30:36.379
It's yours if you want it.

30:36.413 --> 30:38.381
Thanks Benny, but,

30:38.415 --> 30:39.482
I mean it looks great.

30:40.183 --> 30:42.051
Oh and if you ever need a
massage

30:42.085 --> 30:44.154
just give me or Jacob a call.

30:44.187 --> 30:46.289
For you we'd do 30 an hour.

30:46.322 --> 30:48.324
Since when are you a masseuse?

30:48.358 --> 30:50.326
The 2006 recession.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.695
And it's massage therapist.

30:51.729 --> 30:53.430
There's a big difference.

30:53.463 --> 30:54.297
Noted.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.331
I'll keep it in mind.

31:16.453 --> 31:17.688
Because you told me
to.

31:17.721 --> 31:19.522
So I did it.

31:19.556 --> 31:20.490
It might be a prince.

31:20.523 --> 31:22.125
Princes are better.

31:22.158 --> 31:23.193
Princesses are better.

31:23.226 --> 31:25.061
That's why I dressed you up.

31:25.094 --> 31:25.896
And what does
a princess do again?

31:25.930 --> 31:29.399
A princess, she's
pretty.

31:29.432 --> 31:30.467
Right.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.468
She's nice.

31:31.501 --> 31:32.168
Mhmm.

31:32.202 --> 31:34.337
And they do things.

31:34.370 --> 31:35.038
What do they do?

31:35.071 --> 31:37.307
So you gotta be quiet

31:37.340 --> 31:39.442
and do the tea party.

31:39.476 --> 31:41.579
I'll do the tea party.

31:41.612 --> 31:43.079
There's not much tea
left.

31:43.112 --> 31:44.314
Would you like the last cup?

31:44.347 --> 31:45.215
Sure.

31:49.820 --> 31:52.121
Mommy!

31:52.155 --> 31:53.523
Hey, sweetheart.

31:55.826 --> 31:58.027
So, who are you today?

31:58.061 --> 31:59.095
I'm just me.

31:59.128 --> 32:02.265
But I invited the Duchess
of Queensbridge for tea.

32:02.298 --> 32:03.601
How do you do?

32:03.634 --> 32:06.069
Playing dress up, sounds good.

32:06.102 --> 32:07.570
Why don't you and I do more of
that?

32:07.605 --> 32:09.272
Olive, I think mommy and daddy

32:09.305 --> 32:10.774
might need some alone time.

32:10.808 --> 32:13.076
Not now, look it up.

32:13.109 --> 32:13.777
All right.

32:13.811 --> 32:16.479
What are you doing home, Mom?

32:16.513 --> 32:19.617
I'm on vacation.

32:19.650 --> 32:21.484
Would you like to join the tea
party?

32:21.518 --> 32:22.653
Wait a minute.

32:22.686 --> 32:24.120
You said once you ran out of tea

32:24.153 --> 32:25.488
that you're gonna let Dad go
pack.

32:25.522 --> 32:28.324
No, I have
another kettle for Mom.

32:28.358 --> 32:30.493
So you were holding out
on me this whole time?

32:30.527 --> 32:32.830
Yeah, I just need to get it
ready.

32:32.863 --> 32:33.731
Okay.

32:33.764 --> 32:35.198
It's ready.

32:36.032 --> 32:38.268
So you told her you'd
stop playing tea party

32:38.301 --> 32:40.203
once the imaginary tea was gone?

32:40.236 --> 32:43.239
Well we weren't sure when
Mom was getting home today.

32:43.273 --> 32:45.441
When I got to work, everybody
was surprised to see me.

32:45.475 --> 32:48.444
Even Benny told me I should
go home in so many words.

32:48.478 --> 32:49.512
And what do we call that,

32:49.546 --> 32:51.180
a work-life balance?

32:51.214 --> 32:52.315
Yeah, yeah.

32:53.049 --> 32:56.185
That would be mommy's
aim for the next 10 days.

32:56.219 --> 32:57.287
Well cheers to that.

32:58.689 --> 33:00.658
Speaking of which, work
clothes do not do well

33:00.691 --> 33:02.258
for tea parties on the floor.

33:03.794 --> 33:06.195
Mom, I said your tea
is ready.

33:06.229 --> 33:07.631
I know honey, I'm just
changing

33:07.665 --> 33:09.633
into my royal family garb.

33:10.433 --> 33:12.402
So your mom is
coming over dinner tonight

33:12.435 --> 33:14.103
to send us off.

33:14.137 --> 33:15.238
She's making that casserole,

33:15.271 --> 33:19.409
and the spinach strawberry
raspberry thing she does.

33:19.442 --> 33:20.878
God, she loves you.

33:20.911 --> 33:21.612
Yeah she's

33:21.645 --> 33:22.880
- a great woman.
- A great woman.

33:22.913 --> 33:24.080
- A kind woman.
- A kind woman.

33:24.113 --> 33:26.650
Always gave people
the benefit of the doubt.

33:26.684 --> 33:29.720
- And she was a great cook.
- And she can cook.

33:37.260 --> 33:40.664
Why are you talking like that?

33:40.698 --> 33:42.231
Hmm, like what?

33:45.468 --> 33:46.336
Mia?

33:48.672 --> 33:50.741
I just remembered that I told
Mom

33:50.774 --> 33:52.743
that I was gonna meet her for
brunch.

33:52.776 --> 33:55.178
No, Mom, you're having tea
with me.

33:55.211 --> 33:55.846
Really?

33:55.879 --> 33:56.714
She's gonna see you tonight.

33:56.747 --> 33:57.581
I know, I know honey.

33:57.615 --> 33:58.849
I just actually wanna check in
with her

33:58.882 --> 34:00.149
and see if she's okay.

34:02.218 --> 34:02.886
Mia.

34:07.591 --> 34:08.458
What's wrong?

34:09.359 --> 34:10.126
I'll be right back.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.228
I just have to check on
something.

34:12.261 --> 34:14.330
What are you talking about?

34:14.364 --> 34:16.331
Is this really about your
mother?

34:16.366 --> 34:17.801
It is, actually.

34:17.835 --> 34:18.735
What is it then?

34:19.737 --> 34:20.771
I gotta go.

34:20.804 --> 34:21.972
It's just that I passed up
work

34:22.005 --> 34:24.808
so that we could all have
this time together, all of us.

34:24.842 --> 34:26.376
And now you're making up excuses

34:26.409 --> 34:27.210
so you can go to work again?

34:27.243 --> 34:29.445
I'm not making up excuses, I'm
not.

34:29.478 --> 34:30.914
So why are you leaving again?

34:33.382 --> 34:34.652
Because I had a bad dream

34:34.685 --> 34:36.452
that I'm not sure was a dream.

34:37.387 --> 34:38.521
I could have swore it was fake

34:38.554 --> 34:40.356
then you said what he said, and
then...

34:40.389 --> 34:41.792
Okay, whatever.

34:41.824 --> 34:43.292
I'll be right back.

34:43.326 --> 34:44.193
When?

34:45.293 --> 34:46.462
Before the tea's gone.

35:12.522 --> 35:13.389
This is crazy.

35:36.446 --> 35:39.616
Can I get you a
table?

35:39.650 --> 35:41.484
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

35:45.956 --> 35:46.824
Thanks.

35:58.434 --> 35:59.469
Thank you.

35:59.502 --> 36:00.971
Let me know
if you need anything else.

36:01.004 --> 36:01.872
Okay.

36:32.736 --> 36:33.604
Mia.

36:36.807 --> 36:38.976
What, how are you?

36:43.412 --> 36:44.748
I'm great.

36:44.782 --> 36:45.983
I'm sorry to bother you.

36:46.016 --> 36:46.950
I was just leaving.

36:48.518 --> 36:49.352
Mia?

36:49.385 --> 36:50.520
Mom?

36:50.553 --> 36:51.789
What are you doing here?

36:52.756 --> 36:55.525
I was looking for you.

36:55.558 --> 36:57.293
How'd you know I would be
here?

37:01.364 --> 37:03.399
Do you have something to do
with this?

37:03.432 --> 37:04.333
With what?

37:04.367 --> 37:06.904
With that weird guy with all
the money.

37:08.105 --> 37:09.006
How do you?

37:09.039 --> 37:11.407
Honey, what are you even
talking about?

37:11.440 --> 37:12.308
He was waiting here.

37:12.341 --> 37:15.311
He was planning something,
weren't you?

37:16.814 --> 37:18.715
Well I know that.

37:18.749 --> 37:19.616
You know that?

37:21.118 --> 37:21.985
Wait, why?

37:24.021 --> 37:26.556
Were you meeting Robert here?

37:27.591 --> 37:29.092
Well, yes.

37:30.393 --> 37:31.061
Why?

37:34.998 --> 37:36.800
Oh, no, no.

37:36.834 --> 37:37.901
Nope.

37:37.935 --> 37:39.837
Mia, what has gotten into you?

37:39.870 --> 37:40.804
Into me?

37:40.838 --> 37:42.806
You're the one meeting up with
that drunk.

37:43.506 --> 37:45.541
I got a tip that you were gonna
be here

37:45.576 --> 37:47.578
and that you were in danger.

37:47.611 --> 37:49.079
And I'm onto you.

37:49.112 --> 37:50.747
You think I don't know
why you're spending time

37:50.781 --> 37:53.650
with the woman who controls
20% of my company shares?

37:53.684 --> 37:55.686
She may buy your act but I
don't.

37:55.719 --> 37:56.687
Stay away from my company

37:56.720 --> 37:58.155
and stay away from my family!

37:58.188 --> 37:59.056
Mia!

38:01.058 --> 38:01.925
Ugh.

38:05.662 --> 38:08.599
You can see, there's
a real change in climate

38:08.632 --> 38:10.399
and there's a lot more to come.

38:10.433 --> 38:12.501
There's a big storm headed our
way.

38:12.535 --> 38:15.504
Now a lot of rain, possible
snow.

38:15.538 --> 38:17.708
I'd hurry outside if I were you.

38:28.752 --> 38:29.620
Mom!

38:30.754 --> 38:31.722
What?

38:33.624 --> 38:34.892
Emma!

38:36.827 --> 38:37.661
Are you all right?

38:37.694 --> 38:39.062
Yeah I'm fine.

38:39.096 --> 38:40.496
That's my car.

38:41.698 --> 38:43.566
She didn't have to
see the family business

38:43.600 --> 38:46.770
get ripped off by a friend
that we trusted for years.

38:47.905 --> 38:49.538
I'm okay, I'm fine.

38:52.876 --> 38:55.112
Mom, I need a favor.

38:55.145 --> 38:57.047
You need a favor?

38:57.080 --> 38:58.582
Well I don't know if it's 'cause
I almost

38:58.615 --> 38:59.883
repainted a tow truck

38:59.917 --> 39:01.450
or because you were being so
catty

39:01.484 --> 39:03.452
but I am not interested.

39:03.486 --> 39:04.254
No, mom, I need a car.

39:04.288 --> 39:05.956
I have to get back to the
office.

39:05.989 --> 39:07.758
Well you know I don't drive.

39:08.892 --> 39:09.960
I could drive.

39:09.993 --> 39:11.228
Very funny.

39:11.261 --> 39:13.830
He stopped drinking six months
ago.

39:13.864 --> 39:14.731
Excuse me.

39:15.799 --> 39:17.200
Do you want your check?

39:17.234 --> 39:19.502
Mom, do not spend
another minute with him.

39:19.535 --> 39:20.771
You've got a big heart but

39:20.804 --> 39:22.005
he's not worth your time.

39:22.906 --> 39:23.774
I'm sorry.

39:27.744 --> 39:28.745
Tell me you're
packing.

39:28.779 --> 39:30.247
Not exactly.

39:30.280 --> 39:34.651
Hey listen, do you trust your
dad?

39:34.685 --> 39:35.551
My dad?

39:36.519 --> 39:37.721
Not as far as I can throw him.

39:37.754 --> 39:38.554
Why, what's up?

39:38.588 --> 39:40.257
I'm kind of meeting up with my
mom.

39:40.290 --> 39:41.191
I think he's gonna make a grab

39:41.224 --> 39:43.160
for the shares in my trust or
something.

39:43.193 --> 39:44.594
Really?

39:44.628 --> 39:45.528
What makes you say that?

39:45.561 --> 39:46.763
Look, she controls 20%.

39:46.797 --> 39:49.199
He sold the rest of his stock
to her a couple of years ago

39:49.232 --> 39:52.035
because he was broke and he's
probably bitter about it.

39:52.069 --> 39:56.139
Plus I got this dream.

39:56.173 --> 39:57.573
Miss Hoffman?

39:57.607 --> 39:58.241
Yeah?

39:58.275 --> 39:59.609
Your card's been declined.

40:02.545 --> 40:03.479
You had a dream?

40:03.512 --> 40:05.782
Richie, why was my
company card declined?

40:07.150 --> 40:07.985
Would you calm down?

40:08.018 --> 40:09.219
You sound manic.

40:09.252 --> 40:11.655
You gotta try to be less
paranoid.

40:11.688 --> 40:13.056
Go home.

40:13.090 --> 40:14.124
I'm hanging up now.

40:15.192 --> 40:16.059
Richie.

40:17.194 --> 40:18.261
Richie, are you there?

40:22.165 --> 40:23.834
Here.

40:23.867 --> 40:25.135
Here's 20, keep the change.

40:26.169 --> 40:27.704
All right, yeah, this is it.

40:28.805 --> 40:29.673
Thanks.

40:36.313 --> 40:37.948
What the?

40:37.981 --> 40:39.116
Fig Newtons?

40:42.019 --> 40:44.221
Hey Benny, can you take
a look at that agreement

40:44.254 --> 40:45.022
I was asking you about?

40:45.055 --> 40:46.957
I'm concerned I don't know
enough

40:46.990 --> 40:48.592
- about this partnership.
- Excuse me.

40:48.625 --> 40:49.659
Excuse me.

40:50.627 --> 40:52.162
Hold on a second.

40:52.195 --> 40:53.730
Call me back.

40:53.764 --> 40:54.831
Who are you?

40:54.865 --> 40:55.699
- What's going on?
- Miss.

40:55.732 --> 40:57.067
Excuse me, I just need to see
your ID

40:57.100 --> 40:58.602
and I need you to sign in

40:58.635 --> 40:59.302
before you take another step.

40:59.336 --> 41:02.906
Okay, big guy, who are you?

41:02.939 --> 41:04.674
I'm Security Officer Jordan,
aight?

41:04.708 --> 41:06.877
We've implemented some
now safety procedures

41:06.910 --> 41:08.812
trying to protect the tenants
of this building, that's all,

41:08.845 --> 41:10.347
so I just need to see your ID

41:10.380 --> 41:11.815
and I need you to sign in
please.

41:11.848 --> 41:14.284
I am the tenant of this
building.

41:14.317 --> 41:16.720
I'm the owner of Stoneware, Mia
Stone?

41:16.753 --> 41:17.587
Okay, I understand.

41:17.621 --> 41:18.255
Been here five years.

41:18.288 --> 41:19.689
I understand all of that.

41:19.723 --> 41:21.258
I still need to see some ID.

41:23.060 --> 41:23.894
Fine.

41:23.927 --> 41:24.995
Thank you.

41:25.028 --> 41:25.862
Fine, here you go, I've got
one

41:25.896 --> 41:26.797
right there for you.

41:27.731 --> 41:29.066
Says Maya Hoffman.

41:29.099 --> 41:31.134
It's Mia and I'm married now.

41:36.073 --> 41:39.076
Sign in sheet's over there,
all right?

41:39.109 --> 41:40.644
Great, I'll go do that.

41:40.677 --> 41:41.344
Thank you.

41:43.647 --> 41:46.683
ID of a Mia
Hoffman, please, thank you.

41:46.716 --> 41:47.751
Wait, what's going on here?

41:47.784 --> 41:48.952
Just fill out the sheet

41:48.985 --> 41:50.754
and wait here until I can get
verification

41:50.787 --> 41:51.588
from a tenant, okay?

41:51.621 --> 41:53.723
I am a tenant, a verified
tenant.

41:53.757 --> 41:54.791
I can verify myself.

41:54.825 --> 41:57.260
Get it done please,
all right, and wait here.

41:57.294 --> 41:58.962
It won't be that long.

41:58.995 --> 41:59.830
Thank you.

41:59.863 --> 42:00.997
Well thank you.

42:04.067 --> 42:05.368
Hey, have you found anything?

42:05.402 --> 42:06.837
Definitely.

42:06.870 --> 42:08.939
It looks like you need
to exercise your option

42:08.972 --> 42:11.174
to redeem the shares
on the Stoneware trust.

42:11.208 --> 42:12.976
Yeah well I know that

42:13.009 --> 42:14.144
but I'm not gonna buy the
shares.

42:14.177 --> 42:15.312
We're keeping them in the trust.

42:15.345 --> 42:18.882
Okay, but as of midnight,
your partner can buy them.

42:18.915 --> 42:21.084
And if he buys all those stocks,

42:21.118 --> 42:23.787
then he overtakes you
as majority shareholder.

42:23.820 --> 42:25.288
Yeah but Richie's not gonna do
that.

42:25.322 --> 42:26.756
We talked about it.

42:26.790 --> 42:27.858
You talked about it?

42:29.025 --> 42:30.127
Did you write it down?

42:32.062 --> 42:36.099
Mia, he bought you 10 days at a
resort

42:36.133 --> 42:37.234
in another country,

42:37.267 --> 42:40.137
on the same week that your
right of redemption ends.

42:42.739 --> 42:44.941
Well he can't do it
without me knowing, right?

42:44.975 --> 42:47.043
Well that's what I'm confused
about.

42:47.844 --> 42:51.314
He has to put his offer into
writing

42:51.348 --> 42:53.850
and you have to agree upon it.

42:53.884 --> 42:56.686
Did he mention anything
about an agreement?

42:56.720 --> 42:57.888
No, he hasn't said anything

42:57.921 --> 42:59.890
and I haven't signed anything.

42:59.923 --> 43:01.691
Jacob!

43:01.725 --> 43:03.760
What are you doing?!

43:03.793 --> 43:04.461
Benny?

43:04.494 --> 43:05.428
Benny, I have to call you back.

43:05.462 --> 43:07.364
Just get everybody
and K9 right now, okay?

43:07.397 --> 43:09.166
Please, right now.

43:09.199 --> 43:10.033
Okay.

43:10.066 --> 43:10.967
Hey, hey!

43:14.471 --> 43:15.338
Mia?

43:16.339 --> 43:20.277
Unhand me, you
musclebound beefcake!

43:21.444 --> 43:22.946
My name is on the building!

43:22.979 --> 43:24.181
Sure it is.

43:35.859 --> 43:36.760
Hey, boss.

43:38.361 --> 43:40.830
What's going on, guys?

43:40.864 --> 43:42.465
Well we couldn't leave just
yet.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.501
What, what happened?

43:44.534 --> 43:47.037
Well we wanted to talk to you

43:47.070 --> 43:51.241
'cause we feel that we haven't
been treated properly today.

43:51.274 --> 43:52.776
And well, quite frankly,

43:52.809 --> 43:55.178
it's just not like you guys.

43:55.212 --> 43:56.746
Yeah I've been here so long

43:56.780 --> 43:58.248
I really don't know what else to
do.

43:58.281 --> 43:59.482
I can't afford...

43:59.516 --> 44:01.017
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on,
hold on.

44:01.051 --> 44:02.752
You were fired?

44:02.786 --> 44:04.821
Well, yes ma'am.

44:04.854 --> 44:06.456
That's why we're here.

44:06.489 --> 44:08.091
We're hoping you'll hear us
out

44:08.124 --> 44:09.960
and maybe reconsider.

44:09.993 --> 44:13.363
Leanne, Mo, I didn't fire you.

44:13.396 --> 44:15.465
I didn't even hear about this.

44:15.498 --> 44:17.133
I would never fire you two.

44:18.034 --> 44:19.903
Damn, good.

44:19.936 --> 44:22.472
'Cause I was actually out
here to mess up your car.

44:22.505 --> 44:26.376
Now I don't feel the need to
do that anymore.

44:26.409 --> 44:27.277
Oh.

44:27.310 --> 44:28.845
Well, that's settled.

44:33.250 --> 44:34.117
Guys?

44:36.219 --> 44:39.756
Give me a hand and we will
straighten this out together.

44:41.124 --> 44:43.326
Silly Officer
Jordan.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.362
He thinks Mo can just be
replaced.

44:46.329 --> 44:49.366
But that gentle giant was
my father's first hire.

44:49.399 --> 44:50.834
No, you gotta go.

44:52.135 --> 44:53.403
Look, you gotta get outta here,
okay?

44:53.436 --> 44:55.872
I cannot let you in the
building, all right?

44:55.905 --> 44:57.040
You've been relieved of your
duties,

44:57.073 --> 44:58.208
you can't be here.

44:58.241 --> 44:59.075
They played on
the same

44:59.109 --> 45:00.143
college team together

45:00.176 --> 45:03.513
and he was always known
to run a few trick plays.

45:04.481 --> 45:06.416
You can't be here, all right?

45:06.449 --> 45:07.550
You gotta go.

45:08.285 --> 45:10.020
Stop knocking on the windows!

45:10.053 --> 45:12.222
I need you to get off the
premises.

45:13.890 --> 45:16.192
Look, don't make me come
out there, all right?

45:18.094 --> 45:19.329
I said, don't make,

45:21.164 --> 45:22.032
This guy.

45:25.001 --> 45:26.303
Off the door, are you deaf?

45:26.336 --> 45:28.004
You can't be here.

45:29.572 --> 45:30.807
Go home.

45:33.543 --> 45:34.411
What?

45:37.447 --> 45:38.415
You're starting to irritate me.

45:38.448 --> 45:39.316
Go home.

45:41.384 --> 45:42.252
Hey!

45:44.387 --> 45:45.255
Hey what?

45:50.093 --> 45:50.927
Really?

45:52.095 --> 45:54.331
You!

45:58.301 --> 45:58.935
What are you do?

45:58.968 --> 46:00.837
Hey that's private property!

46:05.475 --> 46:06.509
You need to put that.

46:33.570 --> 46:36.039
Going up.

46:49.687 --> 46:51.421
What's taking so long?

46:51.454 --> 46:53.056
Shh.

46:53.089 --> 46:54.224
Hey!

46:54.257 --> 46:55.225
What are you doing?

46:56.359 --> 46:58.128
I'm just doing maintenance.

46:58.161 --> 46:59.028
Where?

46:59.996 --> 47:02.098
406.

47:03.333 --> 47:05.135
406, so you're gonna take this
trash can

47:05.168 --> 47:06.403
up four flights of stairs?

47:07.738 --> 47:08.905
No.

47:10.240 --> 47:11.274
Elevator's that way.

47:11.307 --> 47:13.543
Why don't you just use that?

47:16.012 --> 47:17.581
It's broken, right?

47:20.016 --> 47:21.284
No, ma'am.

47:21.317 --> 47:22.185
Just follow me.

47:27.390 --> 47:28.992
Leanne's
been the head janitor

47:29.025 --> 47:31.027
of Stoneware since its doors
opened.

47:34.531 --> 47:36.299
I played hide and seek
with her in this lobby

47:36.332 --> 47:38.134
when I was a kid.

47:38.168 --> 47:40.236
I don't think either of us had
any idea

47:40.270 --> 47:41.404
it would come in handy.

47:51.715 --> 47:53.216
There you go.

47:53.249 --> 47:54.384
Can you help me?

47:55.218 --> 47:57.420
It's a lot easier than
the stairs, isn't it?

47:58.589 --> 48:00.156
Oh, thank you.

48:01.257 --> 48:02.125
No problem.

48:09.132 --> 48:11.234
Hey, hey wait a minute, hey,
hey!

48:16.206 --> 48:17.207
It worked!

48:18.174 --> 48:20.376
Never thought this
is how my day would go.

48:20.410 --> 48:21.511
You're telling me.

48:27.183 --> 48:28.251
Good luck.

48:28.284 --> 48:29.620
Let's push for total
acquisition.

48:29.653 --> 48:31.689
But if they want some
type of acquisition merger

48:31.722 --> 48:33.657
that's gonna have to be
dependent on my position

48:33.691 --> 48:35.492
which of course will be acting
CEO.

48:40.463 --> 48:41.599
What's going on here?

48:42.565 --> 48:43.433
Richie.

48:45.134 --> 48:46.536
What are you doing here?

48:46.569 --> 48:48.806
I had to sneak past Mo 2.0

48:48.839 --> 48:50.473
to get in my own company.

48:50.507 --> 48:52.208
My card was declined,

48:52.242 --> 48:54.745
now there's a bougie sports
car in my parking spot.

48:54.778 --> 48:55.813
I don't know.

48:55.846 --> 48:57.781
But I think maybe you have
something to do with it.

48:57.815 --> 49:00.083
Mia, Mia, I don't know what
in the world you're doing.

49:00.116 --> 49:02.686
Stop, I know.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.487
You're aiming for majority
shareholder.

49:04.521 --> 49:06.356
You bought me a vacation
so you could buy up

49:06.389 --> 49:08.491
all the shares when I
was in the Caribbean.

49:09.526 --> 49:12.663
You lied to my face, why?

49:13.463 --> 49:15.699
So you could sell the company to
Meta?

49:17.267 --> 49:18.736
Exactly.

49:18.769 --> 49:20.570
Except you got one thing wrong.

49:20.604 --> 49:23.172
I'm not gonna try and buy the
shares.

49:23.206 --> 49:24.574
I already have.

49:24.608 --> 49:26.175
What are you talking about?

49:29.112 --> 49:30.046
See this?

49:31.381 --> 49:32.448
That's your signature.

49:34.317 --> 49:37.387
You're trying to keep this
company out of sentiment, okay?

49:37.420 --> 49:39.690
It's impractical.

49:39.723 --> 49:41.190
I trusted you, Richie.

49:42.358 --> 49:43.226
Yeah well.

49:44.494 --> 49:46.262
Get her out of here.

49:46.296 --> 49:47.698
Let's go.

49:47.731 --> 49:48.599
- Let's go!
- Take your sweat mittens

49:48.632 --> 49:49.499
off me!

49:49.532 --> 49:51.702
I run this place!

49:51.735 --> 49:52.836
And that doesn't change until
midnight

49:52.870 --> 49:54.705
no matter what that paper says.

49:54.738 --> 49:57.106
You know this company
belongs to my family.

49:57.140 --> 49:58.541
Enjoy your vacation, Mia.

49:58.576 --> 49:59.643
Give my best to Kevin.

50:04.682 --> 50:05.515
Calm down!

50:05.548 --> 50:06.850
Ow!

50:06.884 --> 50:09.352
Ooh, that had to hurt.

50:10.219 --> 50:11.087
Sorry.

50:13.891 --> 50:15.358
Get her out of here.

50:15.391 --> 50:17.293
Let me go!

50:17.327 --> 50:18.194
Let me go!

50:21.331 --> 50:22.733
Sorry about that gentlemen.

50:22.766 --> 50:24.133
Where were we?

50:24.167 --> 50:25.002
CEO.

50:25.035 --> 50:27.403
Yes, yes, that would
be me.

50:36.780 --> 50:37.881
Hello?

50:37.915 --> 50:39.415
Hey Mom, it's me.

50:39.449 --> 50:40.350
Are you at my house?

50:40.383 --> 50:42.552
Mia, whose phone are you
calling from?

50:42.586 --> 50:45.388
The 62nd precinct, where are
you?

50:45.421 --> 50:46.522
What are you doing at the
police station

50:46.556 --> 50:48.224
and where's your phone?

50:48.257 --> 50:52.763
They're just holding on to
it for me for a little while.

50:52.796 --> 50:55.565
I'm calling because I may need
your help.

50:55.599 --> 50:56.566
Are you in prison?

50:56.600 --> 50:57.901
No mom, of course not.

50:57.935 --> 50:59.235
I'm in jail.

50:59.268 --> 51:00.938
You're not there with Kevin, are
you?

51:00.971 --> 51:02.472
Look, Mom, listen.

51:02.505 --> 51:04.207
I need you to break open

51:04.240 --> 51:06.509
that slot machine piggy bank
and count out the quarters.

51:06.542 --> 51:08.646
We're aiming for 7500 dollars
here.

51:08.679 --> 51:10.581
Honey, I can't do that.

51:10.614 --> 51:11.915
You're being serious?

51:11.949 --> 51:13.851
That's from Reno, your
father got it for me.

51:13.884 --> 51:14.718
Okay, okay then.

51:14.752 --> 51:18.488
Your bunk hole money, your pinot
stash,

51:18.521 --> 51:20.189
anyway you can, I need it to get
here

51:20.223 --> 51:21.357
as soon as possible, okay?

51:21.391 --> 51:22.626
I don't have that kind of
money

51:22.660 --> 51:24.460
and I don't have a car.

51:24.494 --> 51:25.528
When'll I go to the police
station anyway?

51:25.561 --> 51:26.529
I don't know.

51:26.562 --> 51:27.631
I don't know.

51:27.665 --> 51:29.532
The basic idea here is that
you get to the precinct

51:29.565 --> 51:31.702
and bail me out in as
timely a manner as possible.

51:31.735 --> 51:33.771
I have to save Dad's
company from Richie Howell.

51:33.804 --> 51:35.538
Save the company?

51:35.571 --> 51:36.406
What happened?

51:36.439 --> 51:37.240
I'll explain to you when you
get here

51:37.273 --> 51:39.943
but time is of the essence,
okay?

51:41.277 --> 51:43.346
Well, I mean I can try.

51:43.379 --> 51:46.215
Whatever you do, do not
tell Kevin that I'm in jail

51:46.249 --> 51:47.785
or that you bailed me out in
jail

51:47.818 --> 51:49.987
or anything about jail or any of
this.

51:50.020 --> 51:51.521
Time's up!

51:51.554 --> 51:53.624
Mom, mom, I've gotta go, okay?

51:53.657 --> 51:55.558
I'm gonna see you soon, right?

51:55.592 --> 51:56.794
Right?

51:56.827 --> 51:57.761
- I
- don't know why I thought

51:57.795 --> 51:59.328
everything was going fine.

52:00.831 --> 52:03.366
I've lost my dad during
my obsession with work

52:03.399 --> 52:07.470
and now, losing Stoneware,

52:07.503 --> 52:09.606
my connection to my dad.

52:11.574 --> 52:14.510
I'm losing everything,
God, I need your help.

52:14.544 --> 52:16.446
I'm glad you're
here.

52:16.479 --> 52:17.313
Holy sh...

52:17.346 --> 52:18.615
No power, no hope.

52:18.649 --> 52:20.316
Guard?

52:20.349 --> 52:21.350
Guard?

52:21.384 --> 52:23.587
Your illogical and
overwhelming fear of loss

52:23.620 --> 52:24.888
has realized.

52:25.856 --> 52:26.924
Do you see that guy?

52:31.394 --> 52:32.896
Not the answer I was looking
for.

52:34.832 --> 52:36.365
What do you have now, huh?

52:38.635 --> 52:39.770
What?

52:39.803 --> 52:42.305
What do you have now that
hasn't been given to you?

52:43.306 --> 52:44.474
That can't be taken away?

52:46.009 --> 52:47.010
Your company?

52:48.311 --> 52:48.979
Your money?

52:50.948 --> 52:51.815
Family?

52:53.416 --> 52:54.283
Freedom?

52:55.619 --> 52:57.487
I don't know what you're
talking about.

52:57.520 --> 53:00.389
All I know is that you
kidnapped me, drugged me

53:00.423 --> 53:02.492
and then with some sick insight
of yours

53:02.525 --> 53:03.994
tipped me off about the company.

53:05.561 --> 53:06.663
What about your mom?

53:08.732 --> 53:09.600
And the truck?

53:16.106 --> 53:17.808
You don't have to be afraid,
Mia.

53:19.710 --> 53:20.878
I'm not afraid of you.

53:22.713 --> 53:23.981
Good.

53:24.014 --> 53:25.616
'Cause I'm not going anywhere.

53:28.786 --> 53:29.653
Who are you?

53:31.855 --> 53:32.956
I am who I am.

53:33.657 --> 53:36.960
And that's all that I am.

53:38.796 --> 53:40.363
That answer is so vague.

53:40.396 --> 53:42.666
I now wanna punch you in your
vague face.

53:45.434 --> 53:47.671
You wanna know what
happens next, don't you?

53:49.706 --> 53:50.573
Is that it?

53:51.942 --> 53:53.309
Are you from the future?

53:55.444 --> 53:56.546
Look, Mia.

53:58.481 --> 54:00.818
The past is set, can't change
it.

54:01.919 --> 54:05.022
The future, not so set.

54:05.055 --> 54:08.859
Not in the way that your
little brain can fathom.

54:11.695 --> 54:13.730
But it all begins here.

54:15.398 --> 54:17.034
It all begins now.

54:18.168 --> 54:19.636
What can I do?

54:20.804 --> 54:22.371
I'm stuck here in jail

54:22.405 --> 54:25.609
as my conniving business
partner steals my company.

54:26.310 --> 54:29.813
I almost killed my mom trying
to stop her from being killed.

54:32.983 --> 54:34.885
I feel like no matter what I do

54:34.918 --> 54:36.587
I'm destined to lose everything.

54:38.155 --> 54:39.555
Just like I lost my dad.

54:55.105 --> 54:56.472
And I'm going crazy.

55:08.018 --> 55:09.518
Maya Hoffman?

55:10.187 --> 55:11.655
It's Mia.

55:11.688 --> 55:13.824
You've been bonded, pack your
stuff.

55:24.067 --> 55:25.068
Hey, sweety.

55:25.102 --> 55:25.969
So I don't know how he did it

55:26.003 --> 55:28.105
but it looks like you did in
fact sign

55:28.138 --> 55:30.107
some kind of an agreement
between you and Richie.

55:30.140 --> 55:31.808
Yeah, thanks.

55:31.842 --> 55:34.044
And I've got it
right here in front of me.

55:34.077 --> 55:36.179
Look, everything
changes at midnight

55:36.213 --> 55:38.547
so you gotta call me back ASAP.

55:38.582 --> 55:41.218
I'd give it a 10 on the priority
meter.

55:41.251 --> 55:42.551
Jacob!

55:42.586 --> 55:43.654
Jacob no!

55:43.687 --> 55:45.789
No, no, no, no, not that one!

55:47.624 --> 55:48.692
No, no, no, no.

55:48.725 --> 55:49.593
Shoot!

55:51.161 --> 55:53.562
What took you so long?

55:53.597 --> 55:55.098
Do you mind telling
me why I'm bailing you out?

55:55.132 --> 55:56.967
Richie's trying to
take my company shares.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.101
I need to get to Benny's.

55:58.135 --> 55:59.736
How'd you get the cash anyway?

56:02.505 --> 56:03.173
Hey Mia.

56:05.809 --> 56:08.946
Robert paid $7,000 to post
your bail.

56:08.979 --> 56:10.479
And he'll get it back soon.

56:10.513 --> 56:11.682
And then that's it with him.

56:11.715 --> 56:13.083
He's up to something.

56:13.116 --> 56:15.619
No, Mia, he's not!

56:15.652 --> 56:18.722
He's not, he's just
looking for forgiveness.

56:18.755 --> 56:20.924
Are you the only one with a free
pass?

56:20.958 --> 56:24.027
Are you the only one with a
get out of jail free card?

56:24.061 --> 56:26.897
He was the one driving
the boat that day.

56:26.930 --> 56:28.131
I think that's a little
different.

56:28.165 --> 56:29.967
I lost him too, Mia!

56:32.302 --> 56:33.670
It was an accident.

56:35.005 --> 56:36.472
It was an accident.

56:39.676 --> 56:42.980
Hey Dad,
think fast.

56:48.652 --> 56:51.221
Were you drinking when
you were driving that boat?

56:51.254 --> 56:52.122
No.

56:53.724 --> 56:54.591
Were you drunk?

56:55.659 --> 56:58.028
I didn't start drinking
till after the accident.

56:58.061 --> 57:00.931
Oh, well, congratulations.

57:00.964 --> 57:02.799
You were sober when you flipped
a boat

57:02.833 --> 57:04.067
and killed my dad!

57:49.079 --> 57:50.213
We're going to Benny's.

57:59.122 --> 58:01.024
Come on, pick up, pick up, pick
up.

58:01.058 --> 58:03.927
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

58:03.960 --> 58:04.628
Mia!

58:04.661 --> 58:05.295
Benny, Benny, where are you?

58:05.328 --> 58:06.763
Come to my office.

58:06.797 --> 58:08.098
I'm printing everything out now.

58:08.131 --> 58:08.965
Okay we'll be there in five.

58:08.999 --> 58:10.734
Hey, punch it, we have to get to
Benny's.

58:10.767 --> 58:12.669
We are not endangering
everyone's lives

58:12.702 --> 58:13.904
just so you can make it to the
lawyer.

58:13.937 --> 58:15.005
Mom, stop.

58:15.038 --> 58:16.173
Will you just let me talk to
Robert?

58:16.206 --> 58:17.607
This is important.

58:17.641 --> 58:18.608
- Oh.
- Come on.

58:18.642 --> 58:20.010
As important as the
school council meeting

58:20.043 --> 58:21.111
at Chad Baker's house

58:21.144 --> 58:22.045
when his parents weren't home?

58:22.079 --> 58:23.246
Mom, not now!

58:23.280 --> 58:24.314
Or as important as a softball
tryout

58:24.347 --> 58:25.115
Are you going like

58:25.148 --> 58:26.049
- 20 miles per hour?
- That you never

58:26.083 --> 58:26.917
really attended.

58:26.950 --> 58:28.185
Fine.

58:28.218 --> 58:30.253
15 minutes, we'll be there in 15
minutes.

58:31.688 --> 58:32.389
Happy?

58:32.422 --> 58:35.225
Mhmm.

58:41.832 --> 58:43.200
This is Richie's little deal

58:43.233 --> 58:45.135
that you inadvertently signed.

58:45.168 --> 58:47.237
It exercises his right of
redemption

58:47.270 --> 58:49.806
making him the majority
shareholder.

58:49.840 --> 58:51.408
Little twerp went to another
lawyer

58:51.441 --> 58:52.409
to have it written up.

58:52.442 --> 58:55.745
So Richie is taking
control of the company?

58:55.779 --> 58:57.147
That is not fair.

58:57.180 --> 58:58.315
Not yet.

58:59.382 --> 59:01.685
This other lawyer, a friend of
mine

59:01.718 --> 59:03.186
by the name of Joe Epstein.

59:04.721 --> 59:06.656
He sent this over to me.

59:06.690 --> 59:09.259
And he dated it for today.

59:09.292 --> 59:10.794
But we all know

59:11.495 --> 59:14.131
that your right of
redemption doesn't expire

59:14.164 --> 59:15.966
until midnight tonight.

59:15.999 --> 59:17.234
So does that save me?

59:17.267 --> 59:18.168
Coffee?

59:18.201 --> 59:20.770
Unfortunately, no it doesn't.

59:20.804 --> 59:22.973
Come midnight, he owns the
shares.

59:24.174 --> 59:26.042
Here's the ticker.

59:26.076 --> 59:29.679
This is the Stoneware partner's
agreement.

59:29.713 --> 59:32.716
With the five year cycle
that I was telling you about?

59:32.749 --> 59:37.287
Now section seven specifies
the right of redemption

59:37.320 --> 59:39.823
that Richie's playing around
with.

59:39.856 --> 59:42.459
And that same section also lays
out

59:42.492 --> 59:45.295
the loyalty clause in another
paragraph.

59:45.962 --> 59:49.232
And guess what?

59:49.266 --> 59:53.136
Good old Joe Epstein didn't
specify

59:53.170 --> 59:57.040
which paragraph this agreement
refers to.

59:59.476 --> 01:00:04.381
Tomorrow, this is Richie's
right of redemption.

01:00:04.414 --> 01:00:09.119
But today, it's an offer to buy
you out.

01:00:10.153 --> 01:00:11.488
Get it?

01:00:11.521 --> 01:00:13.156
Anybody else
want some more coffee?

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:14.691
Hey, happy feet, save it.

01:00:15.492 --> 01:00:19.029
Mia, in the original
partnership agreement,

01:00:19.963 --> 01:00:22.332
what does Richie's buyout mean?

01:00:27.837 --> 01:00:31.174
It's an agreement to buy
him out at the same amount.

01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:33.944
Benny!

01:00:33.977 --> 01:00:35.111
Benny, you're a genius!

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:38.215
This is all your father's
work.

01:00:38.248 --> 01:00:41.218
Frankly it's a little
convoluted if you ask me.

01:00:41.251 --> 01:00:44.888
So Richie's left an open
door for me to buy him out

01:00:44.921 --> 01:00:46.122
and he doesn't even know it yet.

01:00:46.156 --> 01:00:49.326
He knows that he doesn't own
the company until tomorrow.

01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:51.494
He's waiting for the
clock to strike midnight.

01:00:51.528 --> 01:00:52.996
So we have to find Richie,

01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:54.331
we have to get him a
counter-offer.

01:00:54.364 --> 01:00:55.532
He's already signed the
paperwork

01:00:55.565 --> 01:00:56.900
so we just need a notary.

01:00:56.933 --> 01:00:58.535
You don't need a notary.

01:00:58.568 --> 01:00:59.536
Are you sure?

01:00:59.569 --> 01:01:00.403
Yeah.

01:01:00.437 --> 01:01:01.338
I am one.

01:01:03.506 --> 01:01:04.975
Of course you are, Benny.

01:01:06.176 --> 01:01:07.310
What's the offer?

01:01:07.344 --> 01:01:09.346
100,000.

01:01:09.379 --> 01:01:10.880
Dollars?

01:01:10.914 --> 01:01:12.382
Cash.

01:01:12.415 --> 01:01:16.486
Actually, it's more like
peanuts comparatively.

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:20.890
Clearly, he didn't expect
you to look at the offer

01:01:20.924 --> 01:01:22.192
while signing it.

01:01:24.261 --> 01:01:26.863
Benny, do you have anything?

01:01:28.198 --> 01:01:30.033
I hate to ask but you
know this would be a loan.

01:01:30.066 --> 01:01:32.535
I would, but I can't get my
hands

01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:34.504
on that kind of cash before
midnight.

01:01:34.537 --> 01:01:37.507
And this transaction needs to be
completed

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:40.277
before the right of redemption
expires.

01:02:06.202 --> 01:02:07.470
A measly 100K.

01:02:18.114 --> 01:02:18.982
Hmm.

01:02:25.989 --> 01:02:26.990
Where's Robert?

01:02:28.925 --> 01:02:29.893
Did he leave?

01:02:30.994 --> 01:02:31.861
Figures.

01:02:39.169 --> 01:02:40.036
Kid.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.874
You doing all right?

01:02:48.378 --> 01:02:49.846
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:55.051 --> 01:02:57.120
I'm just racking my brain

01:02:58.321 --> 01:02:59.456
trying to figure out

01:03:01.692 --> 01:03:02.892
what I can do.

01:03:27.016 --> 01:03:27.884
Yeah.

01:03:31.521 --> 01:03:33.890
I worked at my Dad's firm in the
80s.

01:03:35.191 --> 01:03:38.528
Cut my shark teeth on his
business model.

01:03:42.065 --> 01:03:45.402
Then he got sent into
prison for tax evasion

01:03:45.435 --> 01:03:48.405
and other things.

01:03:55.078 --> 01:03:56.913
I was heir to the throne.

01:04:01.117 --> 01:04:03.119
Now the throne was no Stoneware,

01:04:05.522 --> 01:04:08.024
but if there's anything worse

01:04:09.225 --> 01:04:10.628
than having big shoes to fill,

01:04:15.633 --> 01:04:17.635
it's having dirty shoes to fill.

01:04:26.009 --> 01:04:28.511
It eventually crashed
and burned on my watch.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.048
And I know it wasn't my fault,
but,

01:04:35.518 --> 01:04:39.989
I can't help but feel like I let
him down.

01:04:40.023 --> 01:04:41.558
Like I failed him.

01:04:46.597 --> 01:04:50.366
But, life goes on.

01:04:53.704 --> 01:04:57.340
Anyway, you wanna ride?

01:04:58.642 --> 01:05:00.176
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:01.444
I guess I'll need one.

01:05:05.415 --> 01:05:07.116
I got just the thing.

01:05:34.477 --> 01:05:35.345
I'll be right back.

01:05:35.378 --> 01:05:36.714
You guys do your thing.

01:05:36.747 --> 01:05:38.214
He's not going
anywhere.

01:05:38.248 --> 01:05:39.449
10 minutes, that's all.

01:05:41.084 --> 01:05:41.719
I love you.

01:05:46.089 --> 01:05:46.757
You too.

01:05:54.665 --> 01:05:57.066
That's an awful story, but,

01:06:00.336 --> 01:06:01.337
Are you all right?

01:06:03.239 --> 01:06:05.275
All of a sudden, you don't look
too good.

01:06:06.142 --> 01:06:07.377
You want some more coffee?

01:06:08.511 --> 01:06:10.079
No, no, no, no.

01:06:22.893 --> 01:06:27.196
I brought you here
for a specific reason.

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:28.766
To tell you that story.

01:07:05.769 --> 01:07:06.637
Kevin.

01:07:07.605 --> 01:07:08.471
Hey.

01:07:09.339 --> 01:07:10.540
I can explain everything.

01:07:13.276 --> 01:07:14.177
My right of redemption

01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:17.280
on the company shares expires
tomorrow.

01:07:17.313 --> 01:07:18.649
And it's all going to Richie

01:07:19.515 --> 01:07:23.654
unless I come up with $100,000
and an agreement by midnight.

01:07:24.788 --> 01:07:25.823
But we don't have it.

01:07:28.358 --> 01:07:29.225
I called.

01:07:33.229 --> 01:07:33.864
You couldn't explain any of this

01:07:33.897 --> 01:07:35.431
in the five times I called?

01:07:36.299 --> 01:07:38.234
You don't understand
the day that I've had.

01:07:38.267 --> 01:07:40.169
I've been packing all day

01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:44.608
and the later and later and
later it got,

01:07:44.642 --> 01:07:46.342
I'm thinking to myself,

01:07:46.376 --> 01:07:49.178
why am I not just packing
a bag for me and Olive?

01:07:50.146 --> 01:07:52.248
We could have just gone
on vacation by ourselves.

01:07:52.281 --> 01:07:53.083
Kevin.

01:07:53.117 --> 01:07:55.351
Then I think, that's
ridiculous.

01:07:55.385 --> 01:07:56.519
Thank you.

01:07:56.552 --> 01:07:57.420
You're going.

01:07:59.823 --> 01:08:02.358
No, I was doing this for you,
for us.

01:08:02.392 --> 01:08:03.894
Oh, really?

01:08:07.397 --> 01:08:08.464
No, you're going.

01:08:09.399 --> 01:08:11.635
You're going on a vacation by
yourself.

01:08:11.669 --> 01:08:14.672
And this way, you'll be
free of all the burdens

01:08:14.705 --> 01:08:16.272
of both work and home.

01:08:16.305 --> 01:08:17.675
No.

01:08:17.707 --> 01:08:20.542
No because I can't lose you too.

01:08:21.845 --> 01:08:24.212
Do you know why I'm
holding on to Stoneware

01:08:24.247 --> 01:08:25.381
with white knuckles?

01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:29.419
Because Don Stone is gone.

01:08:30.286 --> 01:08:32.756
He left me and this is
all I have left of him

01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:34.323
and I can't possibly stand to
lose

01:08:34.357 --> 01:08:35.893
anything more than I already
have!

01:08:59.582 --> 01:09:01.551
I don't want you to lose the
company.

01:09:03.453 --> 01:09:04.988
But I don't wanna lose you
either.

01:09:06.957 --> 01:09:08.692
I want you to do things for us,

01:09:08.725 --> 01:09:10.359
I want you to do things for
Olive.

01:09:10.393 --> 01:09:14.832
And if you lose the company,
we'll figure it out, together.

01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:18.035
Really?

01:09:18.068 --> 01:09:18.935
Yeah.

01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:27.542
Okay.

01:09:31.314 --> 01:09:31.982
Do you think

01:09:33.716 --> 01:09:35.886
that God sends angels to us?

01:09:39.055 --> 01:09:39.923
Yeah.

01:09:41.491 --> 01:09:42.390
I know he does.

01:09:45.394 --> 01:09:47.865
God always finds a way of
showing up

01:09:48.932 --> 01:09:50.433
and providing for us,

01:09:51.935 --> 01:09:52.970
of guiding us.

01:09:54.838 --> 01:09:57.608
And sometimes that's the only
way we know

01:09:58.876 --> 01:09:59.877
what was meant to be

01:10:02.478 --> 01:10:03.346
and what isn't.

01:10:48.826 --> 01:10:49.693
Hey!

01:10:53.396 --> 01:10:54.698
Listen, I don't need this.

01:10:54.731 --> 01:10:57.533
I appreciate the gesture
but I'm being serious.

01:11:01.404 --> 01:11:02.873
No.

01:11:02.906 --> 01:11:03.807
I just wanted to...

01:11:03.841 --> 01:11:06.475
No, you don't owe me anything.

01:11:08.511 --> 01:11:10.948
I'm sorry I held this
against you for so long.

01:11:12.616 --> 01:11:15.052
Listen, it's not your fault.

01:11:17.087 --> 01:11:19.089
One accident doesn't define you.

01:11:19.122 --> 01:11:21.592
You are one of the kindest
people I know.

01:11:22.726 --> 01:11:23.994
I'm just learning that now.

01:11:25.796 --> 01:11:26.830
It's who you are.

01:11:31.034 --> 01:11:31.902
Robert.

01:11:33.003 --> 01:11:33.871
The money.

01:11:35.072 --> 01:11:36.974
You're a good person yourself,
Mia.

01:11:38.507 --> 01:11:40.777
Don't let your father's
company go to Richie.

01:11:40.811 --> 01:11:43.714
He doesn't care about the
people.

01:11:43.747 --> 01:11:45.949
He only cares about the money.

01:11:45.983 --> 01:11:49.152
How did you get $100,000 in 20
minutes?

01:11:51.088 --> 01:11:52.455
Don't trust the banks.

01:12:08.471 --> 01:12:09.405
Better hurry up.

01:12:16.512 --> 01:12:18.782
Are you driving a Winnebago?

01:12:24.121 --> 01:12:25.889
So I'm gonna need you to call
Mo

01:12:25.923 --> 01:12:28.025
because we're gonna
need muscle, and Leanne.

01:12:28.058 --> 01:12:29.960
Leanne will not want to miss
this.

01:12:29.993 --> 01:12:30.827
Will do.

01:12:30.861 --> 01:12:32.996
I can't believe Richie would do
this.

01:12:33.964 --> 01:12:34.965
I actually can.

01:12:34.998 --> 01:12:36.700
And Benny, give Benny a call.

01:12:36.733 --> 01:12:38.869
I need him to draft me
up something real quick.

01:12:38.902 --> 01:12:41.038
Okay it takes 30 minutes
to get to Richie's house.

01:12:41.071 --> 01:12:43.140
Then how are we gonna get in?

01:12:43.173 --> 01:12:44.540
If I know Richie, he's not
gonna be

01:12:44.573 --> 01:12:45.742
at his place come midnight.

01:12:45.776 --> 01:12:46.977
Well where would he be?

01:12:48.078 --> 01:12:49.680
I'll meet you at the office.

01:13:13.637 --> 01:13:14.972
We have six minutes.

01:13:15.005 --> 01:13:16.572
What if he won't sign?

01:13:16.606 --> 01:13:17.506
He already signed.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.142
I just have to get the cash in
his hands.

01:13:19.176 --> 01:13:22.212
I think the elevator's been
deactivated.

01:13:25.248 --> 01:13:26.683
The stairs.

01:13:56.313 --> 01:13:58.849
Hey boss, remember earlier
today

01:13:58.882 --> 01:13:59.850
when we were in

01:13:59.883 --> 01:14:01.785
- the elevator together?
- Yeah, that was wild.

01:14:01.818 --> 01:14:03.186
I know, it was crazy.

01:14:13.897 --> 01:14:14.965
What time is it?

01:14:14.998 --> 01:14:19.136
11:56, we still have time,
we're good, don't worry.

01:14:19.169 --> 01:14:20.037
Amanda?

01:14:21.104 --> 01:14:22.639
Oh, hey guys.

01:14:22.672 --> 01:14:24.573
What are you doing here?

01:14:24.608 --> 01:14:25.709
Where's Richie?

01:14:25.742 --> 01:14:26.610
Oh yeah.

01:14:29.079 --> 01:14:30.313
Richie!

01:14:30.347 --> 01:14:31.581
Mia's coming for you!

01:14:33.016 --> 01:14:33.984
There he is!

01:14:34.017 --> 01:14:35.085
Let's go, go.

01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:41.958
Oh, hey there.

01:14:45.095 --> 01:14:45.962
Hey!

01:14:47.397 --> 01:14:49.366
What do you all want from me,
huh?

01:14:49.399 --> 01:14:51.768
You know, I'm gonna
take you up on that offer

01:14:51.802 --> 01:14:53.103
you gave me earlier today.

01:14:54.071 --> 01:14:56.239
Your shares are mine.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.643
You think I'm gonna sell
my shares, you're crazy.

01:14:59.676 --> 01:15:00.510
But you already did.

01:15:00.544 --> 01:15:02.612
All I have to do is give you the
cash.

01:15:04.414 --> 01:15:05.348
Give it!

01:15:05.382 --> 01:15:05.782
Richie, under
the reception desk!

01:15:05.816 --> 01:15:07.017
Give it up!

01:15:09.319 --> 01:15:10.654
It's over, Richie.

01:15:12.022 --> 01:15:12.923
You got that right.

01:15:12.956 --> 01:15:13.790
Whoah.

01:15:13.824 --> 01:15:14.958
Dude, a little too much.

01:15:15.926 --> 01:15:16.793
Get out.

01:15:23.934 --> 01:15:24.801
Back off!

01:15:28.271 --> 01:15:31.074
You do realize you just broke
into my property, don't you?

01:15:32.175 --> 01:15:34.044
Do I have the right to defend
myself?

01:15:37.247 --> 01:15:38.115
Not yet.

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:42.219
My watch says midnight.

01:15:42.252 --> 01:15:45.822
No, no, no, it's definitely
11:58.

01:15:45.856 --> 01:15:46.723
Shut up.

01:15:48.058 --> 01:15:49.159
I trusted you.

01:15:51.995 --> 01:15:54.131
Don't you see I'm
trying to save this place?

01:15:55.031 --> 01:15:57.434
I mean you want to keep your
precious little Ma and Pa?

01:15:57.467 --> 01:16:00.904
Wake up and smell the coffee,
Mia.

01:16:00.937 --> 01:16:02.839
Meta's consuming our entire
market.

01:16:02.873 --> 01:16:05.075
The world is waving a
giant flag in your face

01:16:05.108 --> 01:16:06.977
saying think bigger!

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:09.246
You either sell now or you dry
up

01:16:09.279 --> 01:16:10.947
and vanish into oblivion!

01:16:12.082 --> 01:16:14.117
But not me, no.

01:16:15.485 --> 01:16:17.087
No I'm thinking of the future.

01:16:18.822 --> 01:16:20.157
And you're not a part of it.

01:16:23.293 --> 01:16:24.327
Do it then.

01:16:24.361 --> 01:16:25.228
Mia, no.

01:16:26.429 --> 01:16:27.364
Put it down.

01:16:33.837 --> 01:16:34.804
Don't test me, Mia.

01:16:37.774 --> 01:16:40.043
It's 100,000, sound like a
deal?

01:16:43.246 --> 01:16:45.916
No, no, no!

01:16:45.949 --> 01:16:47.117
Time's up, dick,

01:16:48.051 --> 01:16:48.919
Hey!

01:16:58.361 --> 01:16:59.429
Coffee.

01:17:05.101 --> 01:17:07.404
What do you have
that hasn't been given to you?

01:17:11.408 --> 01:17:12.909
Enjoy your vacation, Mia.

01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:15.145
Freedom?

01:17:18.248 --> 01:17:19.049
Family?

01:17:19.082 --> 01:17:20.917
But I don't wanna lose you
either.

01:17:29.359 --> 01:17:31.294
No power, no hope.

01:17:31.328 --> 01:17:32.762
He's not going anywhere.

01:17:45.075 --> 01:17:46.876
Get your hands off me!

01:17:48.311 --> 01:17:50.013
You dodged a bullet.

01:17:50.046 --> 01:17:51.181
How'd you do that?

01:17:55.586 --> 01:17:56.920
Benny's right on time.

01:17:58.589 --> 01:18:00.156
She's the one trespassing!

01:18:00.190 --> 01:18:00.991
I'm the owner!

01:18:01.024 --> 01:18:02.492
Okay, she can't just waltz in
here

01:18:02.525 --> 01:18:04.828
and take this company back, it's
mine!

01:18:04.861 --> 01:18:05.795
Wait a minute!

01:18:05.829 --> 01:18:07.030
Who's the owner here?!

01:18:07.063 --> 01:18:07.897
I am!

01:18:07.931 --> 01:18:09.065
She is.

01:18:09.099 --> 01:18:10.000
And so is she.

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:11.534
What?

01:18:11.568 --> 01:18:13.470
And so are they.

01:18:13.503 --> 01:18:14.804
What?

01:18:16.172 --> 01:18:18.275
Mo, Leanne, Luisa,

01:18:18.308 --> 01:18:20.443
I'm gonna need your signatures
here.

01:18:20.477 --> 01:18:22.045
What's it for?

01:18:22.078 --> 01:18:24.414
It's for a share in
stock in Stoneware Inc.

01:18:25.348 --> 01:18:28.251
I'm giving you all partial
ownership of the company.

01:18:31.955 --> 01:18:33.390
No ma'am, I cannot.

01:18:33.423 --> 01:18:34.457
No ma'am.

01:18:34.491 --> 01:18:35.358
Just Mia.

01:18:37.427 --> 01:18:38.862
This is ridiculous.

01:18:38.895 --> 01:18:40.397
The same kind of bad
decision-making

01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:42.232
that's held this company back.

01:18:42.265 --> 01:18:45.302
You're gonna drive your father's
business into the ground.

01:18:45.335 --> 01:18:48.071
Mo, can you help Mr. Hulk here

01:18:48.104 --> 01:18:49.939
escort this man off the premises

01:18:49.973 --> 01:18:51.875
and into a police car?

01:18:51.908 --> 01:18:52.876
Yes, ma'am.

01:18:54.377 --> 01:18:56.112
As long as that's okay with
you guys.

01:18:56.146 --> 01:18:58.882
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

01:18:58.915 --> 01:19:00.383
You're gonna pay for this.

01:19:00.417 --> 01:19:02.452
Oh, yeah that reminds me.

01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:08.325
Wouldn't wanna leave without
that.

01:19:12.062 --> 01:19:13.196
And you're fired.

01:19:20.203 --> 01:19:21.538
Mia, thank you.

01:19:21.571 --> 01:19:23.440
Thank you, Luisa.

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.975
You've been a loyal assistant

01:19:26.009 --> 01:19:28.945
and friend for this
company for so many years

01:19:28.978 --> 01:19:31.081
even before I was ever your
boss.

01:19:31.114 --> 01:19:36.086
And for that, I'm making you
Executive Vice President.

01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:38.355
Executive Vice President?

01:19:40.357 --> 01:19:42.425
I mean, I don't know if I can.

01:19:43.326 --> 01:19:44.527
I have a feeling you could.

01:19:44.561 --> 01:19:46.529
Actually I know you could.

01:19:46.563 --> 01:19:47.430
What do you say?

01:19:54.437 --> 01:19:56.239
This is a huge
misunderstanding.

01:19:56.272 --> 01:19:57.374
I'm being framed.

01:19:58.475 --> 01:19:59.909
Could I get a break here!?

01:20:06.483 --> 01:20:09.152
Hey, I don't deserve to be in
here.

01:20:09.185 --> 01:20:10.688
This is my company.

01:20:10.721 --> 01:20:12.422
Yeah, yeah, I know,
I know.

01:20:12.455 --> 01:20:15.058
You're the real deal, the head
honcho.

01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:17.093
You're the owner, right Richie?

01:20:18.161 --> 01:20:19.195
Sorry, who are you?

01:20:20.598 --> 01:20:22.365
Whoah, whoah!

01:20:22.399 --> 01:20:23.533
What are you doing, man?

01:20:23.566 --> 01:20:25.034
How's it feel?

01:20:25.068 --> 01:20:25.935
Don't shoot.

01:20:25.969 --> 01:20:28.304
I'm sorry, I'll do whatever you
want.

01:20:28.338 --> 01:20:29.506
What do you say?

01:20:31.107 --> 01:20:31.941
Please?

01:20:31.975 --> 01:20:32.643
Please!

01:20:34.244 --> 01:20:35.679
It's too late.

01:20:43.319 --> 01:20:45.388
You should see your face.

01:20:56.433 --> 01:20:57.333
I can't
believe how much

01:20:57.367 --> 01:21:00.203
my life has changed in the last
two days.

01:21:00.236 --> 01:21:02.505
I almost lost my company to
Richie Howell.

01:21:06.543 --> 01:21:09.279
Fortunately, Stonewall was
built from the ground up.

01:21:09.312 --> 01:21:12.148
Oh, you read my mind.

01:21:13.617 --> 01:21:15.619
Oh thank you, Miss Lady.

01:21:15.653 --> 01:21:19.522
On coffee and
loyalty.

01:21:23.426 --> 01:21:24.628
Looking good.

01:21:27.497 --> 01:21:28.465
Uh hey, Miss Hernandez.

01:21:28.498 --> 01:21:30.033
Just call me Luisa.

01:21:30.066 --> 01:21:30.768
Gotcha.

01:21:30.801 --> 01:21:31.702
Thanks, Luisa.

01:21:33.503 --> 01:21:35.205
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:37.574
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:21:37.608 --> 01:21:39.275
Shall we get
started?

01:21:39.309 --> 01:21:40.310
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:21:40.343 --> 01:21:41.411
Please sit.

01:22:09.105 --> 01:22:11.040
Are you seeing Aunt
Jenny later?

01:22:11.074 --> 01:22:12.743
Yeah I'm going to a
dance lesson

01:22:12.776 --> 01:22:14.177
with Aunt Jenny.

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:15.411
Yeah, are you really
going dancing

01:22:15.445 --> 01:22:16.747
or are you going to a rager?

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:18.716
I don't know what a
rager is.

01:22:18.749 --> 01:22:22.252
Okay, I think that's later in
life.

01:22:22.285 --> 01:22:23.721
I guess I'll trust you for now.

01:22:25.756 --> 01:22:28.491
Oh, look who we woke up.

01:22:28.525 --> 01:22:30.728
Daddy, go back to bed.

01:22:30.761 --> 01:22:31.629
What?

01:22:32.328 --> 01:22:34.297
Why do I have to go back to bed?

01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:36.466
Breakfast in bed
can't be in the kitchen.

01:22:36.499 --> 01:22:38.067
You can't?

01:22:38.101 --> 01:22:39.202
You sure?

01:22:39.235 --> 01:22:41.371
All right, okay.

01:22:41.404 --> 01:22:42.505
Back to bed.

01:22:45.208 --> 01:22:47.210
Okay, keep stirring, I'll be
right back.

01:23:05.763 --> 01:23:08.364
I thought I was
getting breakfast in bed.

01:23:08.398 --> 01:23:10.099
I'm working on it.

01:23:10.133 --> 01:23:11.735
It's day one.

01:23:11.769 --> 01:23:12.803
Day one of what?

01:23:12.836 --> 01:23:15.104
Family vacation.

01:23:15.138 --> 01:23:17.507
Oh, family vacation?

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:19.275
I like the sound of that.

01:23:19.309 --> 01:23:20.844
Even better than the
Caribbean?

01:23:21.912 --> 01:23:23.513
As long as you're here.

01:23:23.546 --> 01:23:25.114
Good.

01:23:25.148 --> 01:23:26.482
'Cause we missed our flight.

01:23:27.718 --> 01:23:29.319
I figured that might happen.

01:23:31.287 --> 01:23:34.157
So what's on the itinerary?

01:23:35.693 --> 01:23:36.627
No work?

01:23:37.761 --> 01:23:38.796
It's in good hands.

01:23:38.829 --> 01:23:39.697
Hmm.

01:23:40.664 --> 01:23:41.599
So what then?

01:23:43.701 --> 01:23:45.736
Is it time for some dressup?

01:23:45.769 --> 01:23:47.503
Yeah, sounds good.

01:23:48.806 --> 01:23:51.642
Or, I was thinking,

01:24:07.858 --> 01:24:10.828
I never
knew someone was watching me

01:24:10.861 --> 01:24:12.161
but it's comforting to know

01:24:12.195 --> 01:24:14.430
that someone is watching over
me.

01:24:14.464 --> 01:24:16.466
Even if he was a stranger at
first.

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.936
Because I could never have been
prepared

01:24:18.969 --> 01:24:20.871
for what happened just before I
left.

01:24:21.772 --> 01:24:22.740
But he was.

01:24:23.573 --> 01:24:27.711
And he saved my company, my
family.

01:24:27.745 --> 01:24:29.379
He even saved me.

01:24:29.412 --> 01:24:32.181
Mommy, come play dolls with
me.

01:24:32.215 --> 01:24:33.216
Okay.

01:24:33.249 --> 01:24:34.618
I'll be right there.

01:24:36.887 --> 01:24:37.520
There
will always be things

01:24:37.553 --> 01:24:39.555
that demand your attention.

01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:41.357
But loyalty is deciding ahead of
time

01:24:41.391 --> 01:24:43.393
which things are most important

01:24:43.426 --> 01:24:46.964
and then doing those
things no matter what.

01:24:46.997 --> 01:24:48.164
So, Kev.

01:24:48.999 --> 01:24:50.634
How's the driving up there
anyway?

01:24:50.668 --> 01:24:52.535
Hey, don't make me come back
there.

01:24:53.904 --> 01:24:56.472
Mommy, where are we going?

01:24:56.506 --> 01:24:58.341
I don't know.

01:24:58.374 --> 01:24:59.542
I guess we'll find out.

01:25:30.392 --> 01:25:35.392
