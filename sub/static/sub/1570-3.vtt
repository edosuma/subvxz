00:36.463 --> 00:37.763
I don't believe this.

00:37.798 --> 00:39.631
How could they put me
at the kids' table?

00:39.665 --> 00:40.698
I'm 14.

00:40.733 --> 00:41.933
I'm Batman.

00:41.967 --> 00:43.200
No, you're not!

00:43.235 --> 00:44.969
I'm too old for this.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.838
I don't want to be
around all these babies

00:46.872 --> 00:48.606
playing Pokémon... badly.

00:48.641 --> 00:51.476
This kid right here is just
wasting his Charizard.

00:51.510 --> 00:54.245
You are wasting
your Charizard!

00:54.279 --> 00:57.213
Gentlemen, just in time
for the annual hunting trip,

00:57.248 --> 01:00.283
I've purchased an RV,
and I love it.

01:00.318 --> 01:02.986
It's like driving
a terrible little house.

01:03.020 --> 01:04.187
Hunting trip?

01:04.221 --> 01:05.656
That sounds awesome!

01:05.690 --> 01:06.857
Steve, that trip,

01:06.891 --> 01:09.192
like this table,
is for men only.

01:09.226 --> 01:10.427
Yeah, kid.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.328
So make like Pete Weber
in the tenth frame

01:12.362 --> 01:15.998
of the 2007 Pro Bowling
championships and split.

01:21.237 --> 01:22.538
♪ Da, da, da

01:22.573 --> 01:25.842
I love taking
the old '93 Mercury Sable

01:25.876 --> 01:27.342
out for a little joyride.

01:27.376 --> 01:29.911
Letting her stretch her legs.

01:31.614 --> 01:34.649
Oh, oh, odometer's about
to turn over to all zeros.

01:34.684 --> 01:37.185
That might be interesting
to see.

01:39.288 --> 01:41.255
Ooh, check out this girl.

01:41.290 --> 01:42.690
Just drifting along.

01:42.724 --> 01:44.825
What an interesting look
she has.

01:44.860 --> 01:46.694
I'm so interested
in things today.

01:46.728 --> 01:48.161
And well, I'll just say it:

01:48.196 --> 01:51.499
I'm behaving very interestingly.

01:53.535 --> 01:55.536
♪ Da, da, da

01:56.905 --> 01:58.905
♪ Da, da, da...

02:02.075 --> 02:03.209
Well, that's over.

02:04.512 --> 02:05.645
Oh, damn it!

02:05.679 --> 02:07.747
Y-You following
my daughter?

02:07.781 --> 02:09.215
Screw you, buddy!

02:09.249 --> 02:10.683
Get out of here,
you pervert!

02:10.717 --> 02:13.052
Your weird daughter
made me miss the zeros!

02:13.086 --> 02:14.487
She made me miss the thing!

02:14.521 --> 02:15.721
You freako!

02:15.755 --> 02:17.222
I don't know what
you're talking about!

02:17.256 --> 02:18.690
Get back in your house!

02:18.725 --> 02:21.059
Get back in
your damn house!

02:23.596 --> 02:25.764
Next on <i>Guy Who Gets Laid A Lot,</i>

02:25.798 --> 02:28.667
the guy spends the night alone.

02:28.701 --> 02:29.902
Aw...

02:29.936 --> 02:31.769
Psyche! He totally gets laid.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.037
Oh, they got me.

02:33.071 --> 02:34.471
They got me again.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.241
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what is this?

02:37.275 --> 02:38.910
A brief PowerPoint
presentation

02:38.944 --> 02:41.211
about why I should go
on that CIA hunting trip.

02:41.246 --> 02:43.380
No, I told you,
it's for men.

02:43.415 --> 02:45.482
Exactly, and as you can see,

02:45.517 --> 02:47.617
I've gone through multiple rites
of passage,

02:47.652 --> 02:50.587
any of which should qualify me
for this manhood you speak of.

02:52.590 --> 02:53.790
What?!

02:53.824 --> 02:55.458
PowerPoint?!

02:55.492 --> 02:57.060
Why does it keep going back?

02:57.094 --> 02:58.962
I don't even want
these transitions.

02:58.996 --> 03:00.897
It's too busy.

03:00.932 --> 03:03.198
Look, Steve, you couldn't
cut it on this hunting trip.

03:03.232 --> 03:05.601
It's for rough and ready men,
and you're a boy.

03:05.635 --> 03:07.536
Then how do I become a man?

03:07.571 --> 03:09.772
Simple-- you have to hunt
and kill an animal.

03:09.806 --> 03:11.473
Well, how am I supposed
to do that

03:11.507 --> 03:13.442
if you won't let me
on the hunting trip?

03:13.476 --> 03:15.044
That's a catch-22.

03:15.078 --> 03:18.047
Joseph Heller's
absurdist novel?

03:18.081 --> 03:19.380
Whoa, stop right there.

03:19.414 --> 03:22.016
You know I only read books
I've already read.

03:23.919 --> 03:25.319
She's a beauty, sir.

03:25.353 --> 03:27.655
You ever want to drive around
with your poop,

03:27.690 --> 03:29.757
this is the vehicle.

03:42.904 --> 03:44.137
Aah!

03:46.240 --> 03:47.440
Yay.

03:47.475 --> 03:48.609
Steve's here.

03:48.643 --> 03:52.144
A spare tire that doubles
as a human boy?

03:52.178 --> 03:54.546
We live in
wondrous times, Smith.

03:54.581 --> 03:56.682
Damn it, Steve, I'm
taking you home right now.

03:56.717 --> 03:59.619
Nonsense. We're here
and I'm ready to hunt.

03:59.653 --> 04:01.320
Now, let's set up camp.

04:01.354 --> 04:02.655
Move!

04:02.689 --> 04:03.956
That!

04:03.991 --> 04:05.958
Bus!

04:08.327 --> 04:10.929
This is how we're camping?

04:10.963 --> 04:12.296
It's glamping,
not camping.

04:12.331 --> 04:14.866
Oh "glamping," huh, Smith?

04:14.900 --> 04:17.869
You refuse to use that word
for six years,

04:17.903 --> 04:19.938
then suddenly your son
shows up,

04:19.971 --> 04:22.273
and it's like
you thought of it.

04:22.307 --> 04:24.642
We've got an oxygen bar,
a yoga studio,

04:24.676 --> 04:26.476
and a good but not amazing
Thai restaurant,

04:26.511 --> 04:27.711
but it's pretty good.

04:27.746 --> 04:29.113
What do you hunt with?

04:29.147 --> 04:31.348
The only gun I've seen
is the one on the buffet.

04:31.382 --> 04:32.883
Guns? Ha! Steve.

04:32.917 --> 04:34.818
It's glunting, not hunting.

04:34.853 --> 04:37.220
We use something
a bit more sophisticated.

04:37.255 --> 04:39.989
We use
the Hunting Command Center.

04:40.024 --> 04:42.759
Men, let's kill some animals.

04:47.698 --> 04:50.432
Movement detected in Sector K-7.

04:50.467 --> 04:53.435
Coordinating satellite path.

04:53.470 --> 04:55.070
Initiating laser.

04:55.104 --> 04:57.005
Firing in three...

04:57.040 --> 04:58.606
two...

05:01.243 --> 05:02.610
Squirrel hunted.

05:04.147 --> 05:05.881
Squirrel down.

05:08.918 --> 05:10.685
Deer!

05:18.860 --> 05:20.161
It's in the Command Center.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.629
We're powerless!

05:27.134 --> 05:29.402
That gun is meant
to be decorative.

05:29.436 --> 05:31.370
It's a conversation piece.

05:34.041 --> 05:36.475
Smile, you son of a bitch.

05:37.945 --> 05:39.179
You're smiling.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.380
You son of a bitch.

05:46.052 --> 05:47.686
It's learning.

05:47.721 --> 05:48.921
Kill it now!

05:48.955 --> 05:51.190
Steve,
this is your man moment.

06:02.134 --> 06:03.434
Steve, you miss...

06:04.569 --> 06:05.703
What?

06:09.875 --> 06:12.210
My boy is dead.

06:12.244 --> 06:14.578
Long live my man.

06:14.613 --> 06:17.380
Hey, they put out éclairs.

06:21.364 --> 06:23.422
*** from the
tree, Francine.

06:23.463 --> 06:24.796
It was one of those tree-bucks.

06:24.831 --> 06:25.998
You know the ones.

06:26.032 --> 06:27.166
Bang! Stab!

06:33.806 --> 06:36.040
Yeah, well, I just know

06:36.075 --> 06:37.475
they're both
in a better place now.

06:37.509 --> 06:38.642
That's right.

06:38.677 --> 06:41.679
Deer hell.

06:41.713 --> 06:43.514
You were so brave.

06:43.548 --> 06:45.450
I'm so proud of my little boy.

06:45.484 --> 06:47.284
Oh, he's no little boy,
Francine.

06:47.318 --> 06:48.886
He's a man.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.187
Great, I-I'm a man.

06:50.221 --> 06:52.289
Can we just not talk
about this anymore?

06:52.323 --> 06:53.724
Well, you're not a man yet.

06:53.758 --> 06:55.593
There's still the Regaling.

06:55.627 --> 06:57.060
What's the Regaling?

06:57.095 --> 06:58.261
"What's the Regaling?"

06:58.296 --> 07:00.197
He wants to know
what the Regaling is.

07:00.231 --> 07:02.198
Never heard of it, he says.
Can you believe this?

07:02.232 --> 07:04.100
If you want to ask me
a question, Stan,

07:04.134 --> 07:06.703
ask me a question,
but don't use me as a prop.

07:06.737 --> 07:08.638
The Regaling
is a marvelous thing.

07:08.672 --> 07:09.839
After every hunt...

07:09.874 --> 07:11.541
oh, it's just divine!

07:11.575 --> 07:12.809
You tell your hunting story

07:12.843 --> 07:14.443
to a bunch of
drunks at the Lodge.

07:14.478 --> 07:16.212
I have to tell my story?

07:16.246 --> 07:19.147
Yes, and the Regaling
will double as your man,

07:19.181 --> 07:21.683
uh, coming out party.

07:21.718 --> 07:23.886
Wait, no, no, no, your man...

07:23.920 --> 07:25.521
arriving at party.

07:25.555 --> 07:27.422
Your manutante party.

07:27.456 --> 07:28.991
Manutante ball.

07:29.025 --> 07:30.425
D-Don't rush me.

07:30.459 --> 07:31.760
Manutante balls.

07:31.794 --> 07:33.094
Uh, went past it.

07:33.129 --> 07:34.929
Steve, let the women
clear the table

07:34.963 --> 07:36.196
while we adjourn
to another room,

07:36.231 --> 07:38.432
so I can tell you
how proud I am of you

07:38.466 --> 07:40.401
without feeling
like a total gaylord.

07:43.805 --> 07:45.606
Roger, are you feeling okay?

07:45.641 --> 07:47.508
You've been quiet
all through dinner.

07:47.543 --> 07:48.776
Oh, Franny.

07:48.810 --> 07:50.544
You ever miss
a moment in your life,

07:50.578 --> 07:52.612
one of those things
you'll never get back?

07:52.647 --> 07:54.548
You know I have
no regrets, Roger.

07:54.582 --> 07:56.116
That's why I got this.

07:57.985 --> 07:59.553
Your arm is right.

07:59.587 --> 08:01.555
I'm gonna drive
another 100,000 miles

08:01.589 --> 08:03.424
and see those zeros,
if it kills me.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.526
Ooh, road trip.
Bring me.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.160
I've got lots
of good travel bits,

08:07.194 --> 08:09.828
like pretending exit names
are movie titles.

08:09.863 --> 08:11.597
<i>State Road,</i> coming soon.

08:11.631 --> 08:13.166
Or <i>Main Street,</i>

08:13.200 --> 08:14.867
from the makers of <i>State Road.</i>

08:14.901 --> 08:16.769
Hmm.

08:16.803 --> 08:18.104
I don't see that getting old.

08:18.138 --> 08:19.238
Let's do it.

08:19.273 --> 08:20.540
Good idea, guys.

08:20.574 --> 08:22.574
You won't "regert" it.

08:25.111 --> 08:27.612
Steve, we don't want to
be late for the Regaling.

08:27.646 --> 08:31.116
You look like the most
handsome man in the world,

08:31.150 --> 08:33.452
Bollywood star Akshay Kumar.

08:33.486 --> 08:36.054
Oh, did you expect me
to say Ryan Gosling?

08:36.089 --> 08:37.889
I said "the world," Steve.

08:37.923 --> 08:39.823
Get out of your
Euro-centric bubble.

08:39.857 --> 08:41.625
Anyway, you look good.

08:41.659 --> 08:43.094
Regaling!

08:43.128 --> 08:45.929
Regaling!

08:48.967 --> 08:51.068
Okay, now, Steve, when you're
telling your hunting story,

08:51.103 --> 08:52.803
don't forget to
mention all the blood.

08:52.837 --> 08:55.371
People love blood.

08:56.873 --> 08:59.875
Dad, when you first
killed something,

08:59.910 --> 09:01.444
did you feel,

09:01.479 --> 09:03.679
I don't know, guilty about...

09:03.714 --> 09:05.248
Steve, you're focusing
on the wrong thing.

09:05.282 --> 09:08.851
There is a lectern that
is exactly your size.

09:13.990 --> 09:15.390
Go get 'em, champ.

09:15.425 --> 09:16.791
Don't forget the bloo...

09:16.826 --> 09:18.693
Ah, he's gone.

09:21.598 --> 09:23.765
<i>You can do this, Steve.</i>

09:23.799 --> 09:26.001
<i>Be a man.</i>

09:27.336 --> 09:30.004
Uh, since time immemorial,

09:30.038 --> 09:33.174
mankind has been terrorized
by-by the deer.

09:33.208 --> 09:36.744
This fleet brown menace
has owned the night,

09:36.778 --> 09:38.646
nibbling at our gardens

09:38.680 --> 09:40.948
before slinking like cowards
back to the forest.

09:40.982 --> 09:43.183
I used to live
in the forest,

09:43.217 --> 09:44.884
but now I live on the wall

09:44.918 --> 09:47.053
with my wife up in my antlers.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.788
This is humiliating.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.056
Thanks, Steve.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.291
Uh...

09:51.325 --> 09:52.859
uh...

09:55.563 --> 09:59.064
Th-Th-These hideous,
huge, uh, vermin...

09:59.098 --> 10:00.899
He didn't even eat the meat.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.736
And all so he could
become a man?

10:04.771 --> 10:09.975
Well, least we know what
kind of man Steve's become...

10:12.145 --> 10:14.945
a bad man.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.447
Uh...

10:16.482 --> 10:17.715
hideous verm...

10:17.749 --> 10:19.016
uh...

10:19.051 --> 10:20.451
I can't.

10:20.486 --> 10:22.019
I can't do this.

10:22.054 --> 10:24.622
I want to be a man,
but not like this.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.791
I feel awful about what I did.

10:26.825 --> 10:28.193
I mean, when I fired,

10:28.227 --> 10:30.061
I was just trying
to scare it off.

10:30.095 --> 10:31.428
I wasn't trying to kill anyone.

10:31.462 --> 10:33.197
Did you hear that?

10:33.231 --> 10:35.532
He wasn't even trying!

10:35.567 --> 10:37.301
He's an effortless killer.

10:37.335 --> 10:38.569
That's right.

10:38.603 --> 10:42.105
With one shot, he slays not one,
not two, not three,

10:42.139 --> 10:43.473
but four deer!

10:43.508 --> 10:44.675
Four?!

10:44.709 --> 10:46.009
I wanted
to surprise you, Steve.

10:46.043 --> 10:48.844
But it turns out these deer
had babies,

10:48.878 --> 10:51.314
and without their parents,
they will surely starve.

10:51.348 --> 10:52.815
All right, Steve! Way to go!

10:52.849 --> 10:54.483
Congratulations!
That a guy!

10:57.387 --> 10:58.521
Steve...

10:58.555 --> 11:00.289
there's only one way
to be saved.

11:00.324 --> 11:02.257
Ugh! Again with this, Merv!

11:02.291 --> 11:06.127
Ever since you got mounted,
all you do is talk about Jesus!

11:06.161 --> 11:08.230
He is the light!

11:24.379 --> 11:26.947
Okay, we want to rack up
miles on this odometer

11:26.981 --> 11:28.148
as quickly as we can,

11:28.182 --> 11:30.451
so no stops,
drive-throughs only.

11:30.485 --> 11:32.819
And we're gonna share
your bowl as a bathroom.

11:32.854 --> 11:34.355
Oh, please, no.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.789
Not my bowl.

11:35.857 --> 11:38.358
Oh, well. I tried.

11:38.392 --> 11:41.128
You're a messed-up
fish, man.

11:41.162 --> 11:43.196
Is that Steve?

11:43.231 --> 11:45.698
He's in the middle of nowhere.

11:45.733 --> 11:47.600
We should pull over.
We don't have time.

11:47.635 --> 11:48.735
Don't make eye contact.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.320
Don't worry, little guys.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.289
I'm gonna
stay here and raise you.

12:11.323 --> 12:12.657
I owe you that much.

12:12.691 --> 12:15.660
And I'm never gonna kill again.

12:19.818 --> 12:21.369
***

12:22.258 --> 12:23.847
***

12:23.860 --> 12:26.727
***

12:35.185 --> 12:36.851
"Dear Mother and Father,

12:36.886 --> 12:38.353
"Do not worry about me.

12:38.388 --> 12:40.021
"I have something I must do.

12:40.056 --> 12:42.824
"I will return,
although I cannot say when.

12:42.858 --> 12:45.260
Tenderly yours,
Steven Anita."

12:45.295 --> 12:46.361
He's run away!

12:46.396 --> 12:47.362
He didn't run away.

12:47.397 --> 12:48.530
Children run away.

12:48.565 --> 12:49.864
Steve's a man now.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.532
He just went to take care
of some business.

12:51.567 --> 12:52.533
It's all here in the note.

12:52.568 --> 12:53.701
I'm worried.

12:53.735 --> 12:55.903
Francine, it says right here,
"Don't worry."

12:55.937 --> 12:57.572
Do you need to read
the note again?

12:57.606 --> 12:59.407
Your reading comprehension
is terrible.

12:59.441 --> 13:00.841
Look, he said he'll be back.

13:00.875 --> 13:03.211
How long can he possibly
be gone, anyway?

13:08.882 --> 13:10.150
That'll be Bullock.

13:10.184 --> 13:11.851
Time for the annual
CIA hunting trip.

13:12.987 --> 13:14.488
I can't believe
it's been a year

13:14.522 --> 13:15.822
since Steve left.

13:15.856 --> 13:17.457
God, I hope he's all right.

13:17.492 --> 13:18.825
I'm sure he's fine.

13:18.859 --> 13:20.693
He's probably living
up in Billings, Montana.

13:20.728 --> 13:22.329
Got a little stake
in a copper mine.

13:22.363 --> 13:23.963
Maybe a wife... Rose.

13:23.998 --> 13:26.532
Good ol' Rosie,
salt of the earth.

13:26.566 --> 13:29.201
He'll get down to Bozeman
one of these days.

13:29.236 --> 13:31.671
It's been so quiet around here.

13:31.705 --> 13:33.840
Roger, Klaus and Hayley
are still on

13:33.874 --> 13:35.675
that 100,000-mile
road trip.

13:35.709 --> 13:37.677
I didn't go on that trip.

13:37.711 --> 13:41.880
Hmm, you've really been flying
under the radar this year.

13:44.416 --> 13:47.885
Mmm! Eat plenty of moss,
my growing boys,

13:47.919 --> 13:49.887
or no lichen for dessert.

13:49.921 --> 13:52.590
I sure like lichen.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.192
Hey, where you going?

13:57.729 --> 13:59.797
The CIA hunting trip.

13:59.831 --> 14:03.066
So, it has been a year already.

14:04.435 --> 14:06.336
Again? You just went!

14:07.505 --> 14:09.339
What do you mean?
You know where it is.

14:09.374 --> 14:11.575
It's wherever
you want it to be.

14:18.215 --> 14:19.415
Is this lasagna?

14:19.449 --> 14:21.150
Did we agree on lasagna?

14:21.185 --> 14:23.419
I never would've voted
for lasagna.

14:23.453 --> 14:25.054
Father!

14:27.757 --> 14:29.124
Steve?!

14:30.427 --> 14:31.661
Steve! You're here!

14:31.695 --> 14:33.195
It's so good to see you.

14:33.229 --> 14:34.729
Well, you've seen me.

14:34.763 --> 14:36.731
And now it's time
for you and your kind

14:36.765 --> 14:38.132
to leave this place.

14:38.167 --> 14:39.601
What are you talking about?

14:39.635 --> 14:41.203
I have renounced
the ways of man,

14:41.237 --> 14:42.304
and have been living
in the woods

14:42.338 --> 14:43.971
raising the two deer
I orphaned.

14:44.006 --> 14:45.740
There will be no hunting
here today,

14:45.774 --> 14:47.375
nor ever again.

14:47.410 --> 14:48.976
But... the things
you're saying!

14:49.011 --> 14:50.477
All this time, I thought...

14:50.512 --> 14:53.480
you're not a man;
you're not even a mammal!

14:53.515 --> 14:54.948
You're an anti-mammal!

14:54.982 --> 14:56.650
That doesn't roll
off the tongue, does it?

14:56.685 --> 14:58.151
I'll have to combine
all those words,

14:58.186 --> 14:59.853
off the cuff,
to create a new word.

14:59.887 --> 15:02.523
I call you "an-i-mal."

15:02.557 --> 15:04.425
That's it...
"an-i-mal."

15:04.459 --> 15:07.227
It may not be a word,
but I know what it means.

15:07.261 --> 15:11.130
Will you make peace
with an... "an-i-mal"?

15:11.164 --> 15:12.298
Did I say that right?

15:12.333 --> 15:13.966
Yes, you did.
And no, I won't!

15:14.000 --> 15:15.968
Then you've brought
this war on yourself.

15:17.638 --> 15:19.972
So does this mean
you and Rosie split up?

15:20.006 --> 15:21.906
Marriage is hard, son!

15:21.941 --> 15:24.809
You gotta learn
to tune out the nonsense!

15:34.954 --> 15:36.888
This is it.
It's finally here!

15:36.922 --> 15:38.088
Oh, my God.

15:38.123 --> 15:40.625
Here we go.

15:47.499 --> 15:48.466
What?!

15:48.500 --> 15:50.167
This is a '93 Sable!

15:50.201 --> 15:51.802
How is this happening?

16:04.482 --> 16:06.150
You can do it.

16:06.184 --> 16:08.318
Almost there.

16:16.860 --> 16:20.696
I'm not a vet, but I think
you're overfeeding your fish.

16:20.730 --> 16:24.000
As for you, all your organs
are wrong and scary to me.

16:24.034 --> 16:25.668
You might want
to have that looked at.

16:25.702 --> 16:27.135
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!

16:27.170 --> 16:28.136
What? What is it?

16:28.171 --> 16:29.271
The ambulance odometer's

16:29.305 --> 16:31.106
about to roll over to 100,000!

16:31.140 --> 16:33.675
You gotta get up here
and see this, bro!

16:33.709 --> 16:35.010
Five zeros?!

16:35.044 --> 16:36.577
Hot dog!

16:37.880 --> 16:38.880
Dear Lord.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.215
Some people go their whole lives

16:40.249 --> 16:41.716
without seeing something
this beautiful.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.150
I can almost...

16:48.756 --> 16:52.026
Boys, all of your training
has been leading to this moment.

16:52.060 --> 16:53.760
Except for
the three months I wasted

16:53.795 --> 16:55.196
trying to teach you English.

16:55.230 --> 16:56.630
Go!

16:58.199 --> 17:00.533
And this one I scraped
on a rock,

17:00.567 --> 17:02.035
but it doesn't hurt.

17:02.069 --> 17:05.438
Sir, I'm picking up
something on the radar.

17:06.740 --> 17:08.842
I know what this is.

17:08.876 --> 17:12.578
Okay, my son wants a war,
let's give it to him.

17:22.355 --> 17:23.655
The sauna!

17:23.689 --> 17:24.923
We still have the steam room!

17:24.958 --> 17:26.558
But I prefer dry heat!

17:30.095 --> 17:32.096
It's an ambush!
We have to rally!

17:51.148 --> 17:52.615
Aah! Ticks!

17:52.649 --> 17:54.650
I feel tired all of a sudden.

17:54.685 --> 17:56.219
My muscles are achy,

17:56.254 --> 17:58.788
and my temperament
feels inconsistent.

18:01.792 --> 18:03.492
American bald eagles!

18:03.526 --> 18:04.726
We're saved!

18:06.429 --> 18:07.829
Snakes!

18:14.938 --> 18:17.172
Our espresso bar
with free WiFi!

18:17.207 --> 18:18.539
I've seen quite enough!

18:26.648 --> 18:27.949
Smith!
We're getting out of here!

18:27.983 --> 18:29.817
And surrender? Never!

18:29.851 --> 18:33.254
I'll tell your family
you were killed by chipmunks.

18:33.289 --> 18:35.555
(engine revs, tires screech

18:35.589 --> 18:39.626
It's about time that the hunter
who became the hunted

18:39.660 --> 18:41.795
becomes the hunter.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.197
Again.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.269
Boys? That you?

18:50.938 --> 18:52.871
It's over. We won.

18:54.274 --> 18:56.775
Dignan? Applejack?

18:58.312 --> 19:01.647
Ugh! I can't smell anything
with my seasonal allergies.

19:01.681 --> 19:02.681
Hey, Zyrtec!

19:03.317 --> 19:04.183
Aah!

19:05.319 --> 19:07.218
You can't stop me
from hunting, Steve.

19:07.253 --> 19:08.719
It's wrong, Dad.

19:08.754 --> 19:10.288
Hunting for sport is wrong.

19:10.323 --> 19:11.789
I feel very differently.

19:11.824 --> 19:13.425
My boys will come for me.

19:13.459 --> 19:14.859
Oh, I'm counting on it.

19:15.861 --> 19:17.996
Don't hurt him!
He's my son!

19:18.030 --> 19:19.965
You betrayed your species.

19:19.999 --> 19:21.166
He's not your son,

19:21.200 --> 19:23.133
he's something for drunks
to shoot at.

19:23.168 --> 19:24.634
I've told you a thousand times,

19:24.669 --> 19:26.770
it's killing
that makes the man.

19:29.540 --> 19:31.308
Clever boy.

19:38.215 --> 19:40.283
No! Don't kill him!

19:40.317 --> 19:41.684
It's not what we do!

19:41.718 --> 19:42.785
Yeah, what he said.

19:42.819 --> 19:44.220
Killing's not what makes a man.

19:44.254 --> 19:45.321
It's something else.

19:47.557 --> 19:49.058
You'll regret it.

19:49.093 --> 19:50.726
I did.

20:01.037 --> 20:03.738
Dad, I'd like you to meet
your grandchildren.

20:03.772 --> 20:05.407
Uh, hello.

20:05.441 --> 20:07.109
Sorry Peepaw tried to kill you.

20:07.143 --> 20:10.411
I've been dreading this day,
but it's time.

20:11.779 --> 20:12.613
You're ready now.

20:12.647 --> 20:14.015
You have to go!

20:14.049 --> 20:17.184
Go! Get out of here!
Shoo!

20:17.219 --> 20:20.488
Yeah, yeah, they left
as soon as you said "go."

20:23.291 --> 20:25.393
You're probably pretty
disappointed in me, huh?

20:25.427 --> 20:26.926
Why would I be
disappointed in you?

20:26.960 --> 20:29.896
'Cause I'm not a man,
and I guess I'll never be.

20:29.930 --> 20:32.298
No, Steve, I was wrong.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.100
Anyone can kill.

20:34.135 --> 20:36.302
But it takes a real man
to show mercy.

20:36.337 --> 20:38.004
You taught me that.

20:38.039 --> 20:39.672
So, I'm a man?

20:39.706 --> 20:41.974
At long last, I'm a man?

20:42.009 --> 20:43.942
You bet your ass you are.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.511
But only in the woods.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.847
And we're never coming
back here again.

20:48.881 --> 20:53.621
So those deer know how to
use guns, huh? That's cool.

20:53.652 --> 20:55.113

Well, we're almost to
100,000 again, Klaus...

21:10.799 --> 21:12.800
's bones.

21:15.202 --> 21:17.671
Ooh! Is that one of
those deer men?

21:17.705 --> 21:19.305
They're so interesting!

21:24.545 --> 21:26.145
Noooo!

21:26.180 --> 21:28.147
Bye, have a beautiful time!
