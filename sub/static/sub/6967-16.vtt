00:52.252 --> 00:53.480
God...

00:55.221 --> 00:57.655
- What are you doing to Barnett?
- Excuse me?

00:59.225 --> 01:00.317
What are you doing to Johnny?

01:02.095 --> 01:04.825
Go back to your ward. There's nothing
you can do for your friend now.

01:05.865 --> 01:07.924
- What?
- John Barnett is dead.

01:09.335 --> 01:10.700
No, I heard him screaming.

01:14.641 --> 01:16.506
I said John Barnett is dead.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.476
You understand?

01:22.749 --> 01:24.842
Go on, Crandall. Get outta here.

01:26.519 --> 01:29.647
There's nothing more to see here.
You understand?

02:35.421 --> 02:38.447
I still don't get it.
What does this have to do with us?

02:38.558 --> 02:41.356
Robbing ajewelry store is a federal crime.

02:41.427 --> 02:42.917
Thank you.

02:43.029 --> 02:48.194
I don't know. I got a call from a guy I worked
with in Violent Crimes. Said it was important.

02:54.674 --> 02:57.074
Reggie! Reggie!

02:57.177 --> 02:59.611
Mulder! I hate it when you do that.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.477
This is Special Agent Scully. Reggie Purdue.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.948
- How are you?
- Fine. What happened here?

03:05.018 --> 03:10.183
Lone gunman took out a salesgirl
after she filled up a bag for him.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.985
You guys turn up anything?

03:13.459 --> 03:15.984
Not much, except

03:16.062 --> 03:17.495
this.

03:17.597 --> 03:19.258
It's gonna blow your mind.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.992
Why?

03:21.067 --> 03:26.232
I'm telling you, Mulder,
this is going to blow... your... mind.

03:28.808 --> 03:31.641
- What is it?
- Wait... wait a second.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.908
- See why I called you?
- What about witness descriptions?

03:35.014 --> 03:38.506
White male, five-eleven to six feet, ski mask.

03:40.286 --> 03:43.619
- Damn it, Reggie. That's Barnett.
- Yeah, but it can't be.

03:45.491 --> 03:46.981
Who's Barnett?

03:52.332 --> 03:53.924
It was my first case at the Bureau.

03:54.033 --> 04:00.029
Barnett was doing armed jobs all over DC and
getting away with it. He killed seven people.

04:00.106 --> 04:03.007
There was this big task force.
Reggie was my ASAC.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.601
I was 28 years old. Right out of the Academy.

04:05.678 --> 04:09.876
I had this theory on the case.
Reggie thought I was full of it.

04:09.949 --> 04:11.416
I was full of it.

04:11.484 --> 04:14.851
- What was the theory?
- That Barnett had an inside connection.

04:14.921 --> 04:19.949
An employee at the armored car company
was tipping him off. I was sort of right.

04:20.059 --> 04:21.286
Sort of?

04:21.361 --> 04:25.457
Yeah, we planted bogus waybills
with the armored car company to set a trap.

04:25.531 --> 04:29.558
But Barnett was way ahead of us.
That's when the notes started.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.334
"Fox can't guard the chicken coop."

04:33.439 --> 04:35.498
Clever, huh?

04:35.575 --> 04:39.944
- So you never caught him?
- No, we did. We did, but not...

04:40.046 --> 04:41.479
not clean.

04:41.547 --> 04:44.277
An agent died because I screwed up.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.346
And what happened to Barnett?

04:50.256 --> 04:52.451
He avoided the death penalty
on a technicality,

04:52.525 --> 04:56.962
but he went down for every job he did.
Consecutive terms: 340 years.

04:57.063 --> 04:59.293
The judge promised me he'd die in prison.

05:00.366 --> 05:01.799
So you think he escaped?

05:01.901 --> 05:05.894
No, that's just it.
He did die in prison, four years ago.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.107
You're sure?

05:08.941 --> 05:10.806
I was paying attention.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.771
This guy a friend of yours?

05:16.883 --> 05:20.512
Yeah, I play golf with him
every Sunday. What do you think?

05:21.354 --> 05:23.549
You just brought this in ten minutes ago.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.090
You're slipping, Henderson.

05:26.159 --> 05:30.892
Ten minutes may be enough time for you.
Course, I wouldn't know from experience.

05:30.963 --> 05:33.591
Yeah... Seriously, what do you think?

05:33.700 --> 05:40.003
OK, first impressions: The ink is fresh,
the note was written in the last 48 hours.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.106
Ballpoint, but you knew that.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.304
A right-hander. Let's see...

05:46.379 --> 05:49.746
Written by someone sitting down.
Now I'm just showing off.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.909
Yeah. Does it match Barnett?

05:53.419 --> 05:55.319
I'd say it's him.

05:55.388 --> 05:56.855
But you're not sure?

05:56.956 --> 05:58.821
95 per cent.

05:58.925 --> 06:02.827
Writing's sloppy. Some of the ascenders
and descenders are heavier.

06:03.429 --> 06:06.956
Could it have been traced over
an old note of Barnett's?

06:07.033 --> 06:09.729
Could be, but it's a damn good job if it is.

06:10.536 --> 06:14.563
- Thanks, Henderson. I owe you one.
- Promises, promises.

06:17.977 --> 06:21.606
There's Barnett.
We staked out an airport warehouse,

06:21.681 --> 06:26.675
but everything went to hell when Barnett took
the driver of the armored truck hostage.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.413
Where's Mulder?

06:29.088 --> 06:32.182
There, coming round back.
Barnett doesn't see him.

06:35.194 --> 06:38.459
- He's got a clear shot.
- Yeah. He should have taken it.

06:39.832 --> 06:41.493
But he couldn't.

06:41.601 --> 06:44.195
No, no, not with the hostage so close.

06:46.205 --> 06:48.469
Because it's not by the book.

06:49.308 --> 06:53.005
It would have saved one life, maybe two.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.515
Bastard Barnettjust started blasting away.

07:00.186 --> 07:01.847
So Mulder did shoot Barnett.

07:03.022 --> 07:07.891
Twice - in the shoulder and hand.
But not before Barnett killed the driver

07:07.994 --> 07:10.588
and Agent Steve Wallenberg.

07:10.663 --> 07:14.656
Mulder... never forgave himself for that.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.926
You should have heard his testimony
at Barnett's trial.

07:18.037 --> 07:21.234
Probably had a lot to do with
the sentence Barnett got.

07:21.307 --> 07:25.903
I'll never forget Mulder
coming down from the witness stand

07:26.012 --> 07:30.676
and Barnett turning
and saying he'd get Mulder.

07:30.750 --> 07:36.450
To tell you the truth, I wish Mulder had killed
Barnett right there in the warehouse.

07:49.869 --> 07:54.533
- What did Henderson come up with?
- 95 per cent sure it's Barnett's handwriting.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.073
What's that?

07:56.142 --> 07:59.976
Federal Bureau of Prisons
sent me a copy of his death certificate.

08:00.079 --> 08:04.379
Name of deceased: Barnett, John Irvine.
Cause of death: Cardiac arrest.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.544
Date: September 16th 1989.

08:07.653 --> 08:11.953
- Then it must be a very clever copycat.
- The note was written in the last 48 hours.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.117
- Pull any prints?
- No prints.

08:14.260 --> 08:17.889
Barnett had time in prison
to plan this with someone on the outside.

08:17.964 --> 08:22.367
- Revenge from the grave? A neat trick.
- He planned to get you, didn't he?

08:26.138 --> 08:28.663
I was just down talking to Agent Purdue.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.407
He show you the video tape?

08:34.881 --> 08:38.317
- You did the right thing, Mulder.
- Did I?

08:38.384 --> 08:40.909
Steve Wallenberg had a wife and two kids.

08:40.986 --> 08:43.581
One boy is an all-star
on his football team now.

08:43.688 --> 08:48.092
I shoot two seconds earlier
and Wallenberg'd be here to see his kid play.

08:48.194 --> 08:53.188
Instead, I got some dead man robbing
jewelry stores and sending me haikus.

08:54.967 --> 08:56.901
Let's go!

08:57.503 --> 09:00.631
Go, go, go. Right in there!

09:03.509 --> 09:05.568
Very good!

09:06.245 --> 09:07.906
Way to go, Alec.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.648
Two! One! Hut!

10:22.088 --> 10:24.386
I'll get you, you son of a bitch!

10:52.918 --> 10:57.412
I've been thinking about it, Mulder, and
I think somebody is messing with your head.

10:57.490 --> 11:01.620
- Barnett said he'd get me. You were there.
- I don't care what he said. He's dead.

11:01.694 --> 11:04.322
- Apparently not.
- Aw, come on.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.524
There are a lot of guys
who know that Barnett made the threat.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.498
It's Barnett, Reggie!

11:09.568 --> 11:12.435
- How could you say that?
- I don't know. I just feel it.

11:23.082 --> 11:26.848
All this talk around here about
Spooky Mulder, I never paid it much mind.

11:26.919 --> 11:30.355
I figured it was just talk
about how paranoid you were an' all.

11:30.456 --> 11:31.946
And now?

11:33.159 --> 11:35.855
Remember the day you walked into my office
wet from Quantico?

11:35.928 --> 11:40.331
You pissed me offjust looking at you,
but then I saw how your mind worked.

11:40.399 --> 11:45.268
How you were always three jumps ahead.
It was scary, Mulder. Everybody said so.

11:45.337 --> 11:49.501
- I've heard this story.
- Well, maybe you ought to hear it again!

11:49.575 --> 11:54.069
You let a lot of people down here
in the Bureau. They had big plans for you.

11:54.146 --> 11:59.482
A lot of people are saying that Spooky Mulder
has become an embarrassment. A liability.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.079
What? Are you saying that
somebody from the Bureau's behind this?

12:03.155 --> 12:06.318
Maybe, maybe not.
Just always best to cover your ass.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.428
Sorry.

12:13.299 --> 12:14.960
This was just faxed.

12:15.034 --> 12:18.026
It's a copy of John Barnett's
last will and testament.

12:18.137 --> 12:20.196
No surviving relatives.

12:20.306 --> 12:24.106
Left what little he had to another prisoner,
a Joe Crandall,

12:24.176 --> 12:26.736
and instructions to be cremated.

12:26.812 --> 12:29.542
His will was executed
six months after his death

12:29.615 --> 12:34.143
and this states that his ashes were
spread along the bank of the Delaware River

12:34.220 --> 12:37.781
by an employee of the crematory
used by the prison.

12:37.857 --> 12:40.189
Somebody's messing with your head.

12:40.993 --> 12:43.461
Killing a salesclerkjust to leave me a note?

12:43.562 --> 12:46.463
I'd say that's going a little out of your way.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.562
He's older now.
He may have put on some weight.

12:54.673 --> 12:57.164
- How much older?
- Five years.

13:03.749 --> 13:06.775
He could be wearing any kind of disguise.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.028
Take us back to the day in question.

13:26.505 --> 13:31.602
Was it your impression, Agent Mulder,
that John Barnett took a perverse pleasure

13:31.677 --> 13:33.110
in his crimes?

13:33.212 --> 13:35.772
Didn't he send you notes to taunt you?

13:36.415 --> 13:39.316
Yes, I felt that he was daring us to catch him.

13:39.418 --> 13:43.013
That he killed his victims
almost as if it were part of a game.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.087
Describe for the court,
if you would, Agent Mulder,

13:46.192 --> 13:49.286
what happened
when you finally caught John Barnett.

13:50.930 --> 13:54.229
We had a customs warehouse
at the airport staked out.

13:54.300 --> 13:58.202
We knew Barnett had someone
working for the armored car transport

13:58.270 --> 14:01.103
tipping them off about large cash shipments.

14:01.207 --> 14:04.643
But we never figured
he'd be inside the vehicle when it arrived.

14:04.710 --> 14:08.407
That's how Barnett was able
to take the driver of the vehicle hostage.

14:08.514 --> 14:13.247
In other words, John Barnett
used his own accomplice as a hostage?

14:14.153 --> 14:15.211
Yes, ma'am.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.312
And then what happened?

14:17.423 --> 14:22.827
We surrounded Barnett and we ordered him
to surrender his hostage and his weapon.

14:22.895 --> 14:26.262
And where were you at this time,
Agent Mulder?

14:27.733 --> 14:29.633
I was right behind Barnett.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.133
With a clear shot of the suspect?

14:33.939 --> 14:35.429
Yes, ma'am.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.301
But you didn't fire. Why?

14:38.444 --> 14:44.246
No. It's against FBI regulations to
unnecessarily endanger the life of a hostage.

14:44.316 --> 14:47.979
And I thought that with no means of escape

14:48.087 --> 14:50.078
Barnett would give up.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.383
But what happened instead?

14:55.060 --> 14:58.461
The suspect, John Barnett,

14:59.398 --> 15:02.663
fired his weapon point-blank
at his hostage

15:03.302 --> 15:06.499
and then he turned his gun on
Steve Wallenberg.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.006
Shot him in the face.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.538
Thank you, Agent Mulder.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.479
No further questions at this time.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.712
He gunned him down just for spite.

15:22.788 --> 15:24.688
Your Honor, we object!

15:24.757 --> 15:27.920
This was a man
with a wife and two small children,

15:27.993 --> 15:31.929
and you shot him without...
hesitation, without a conscience

15:31.997 --> 15:34.329
- or humanity!
- Your Honor, do something!

15:34.400 --> 15:37.767
Which is why you should die like an animal,
you son of a bitch!

15:37.836 --> 15:41.897
If you do not stop,
it will be contempt of court. Order!

15:44.209 --> 15:47.770
If there's not order,
I will be forced to clear the courtroom!

15:47.846 --> 15:51.612
Your Honor,
this is inflammatory against the defendant.

15:51.717 --> 15:55.118
- I ask that it be stricken from the record.
- Duly noted.

15:55.187 --> 15:59.351
The jury will disregard
the witness's last statement.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.792
I'll... get... you.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.080
- I'll need printouts of every variation.
- Right.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.815
I just got off the phone with the prison.

16:25.884 --> 16:29.615
- What did they come up with?
- No, I called them on a hunch.

16:29.688 --> 16:33.852
Barnett died of a heart attack.
Or so it says on his death certificate.

16:33.959 --> 16:37.019
Well, I had them fax me
all of his medical records.

16:37.096 --> 16:41.590
Barnett was admitted to the prison infirmary
for an infection in his right hand.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.569
There isn't any indication or diagnosis
of coronary complications.

16:45.637 --> 16:50.233
In fact, on his physical six months earlier
he was given a clean bill of health.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.405
Crandall, someone to see you.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.643
I don't get many visitors.

16:59.718 --> 17:02.653
- You knew John Barnett?
- Yes, sir.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.814
How well did you know him?

17:04.890 --> 17:07.450
Pretty well.

17:07.526 --> 17:12.656
He left you everything in his will. You must
have known him better than "pretty well".

17:12.731 --> 17:17.531
I used to change his bandages
and we just got to... know each other.

17:17.636 --> 17:21.732
Are you aware that Barnett died of
cardiac arrest in this facility in 1989?

17:21.839 --> 17:26.242
- Cardiac arrest! Where's it say that?
- On his death certificate.

17:29.848 --> 17:30.837
He ain't dead, is he?

17:32.151 --> 17:33.709
Why do you say that?

17:33.819 --> 17:39.553
Last time I saw John Barnett
was right in that room over there.

17:39.658 --> 17:42.092
Doctor with a knife
took his bad hand clean off.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.322
- What doctor?
- Was it Dr Ridley?

17:44.430 --> 17:46.898
Yeah, it was Dr Ridley. That's the one.

17:48.934 --> 17:52.301
He told me Johnny was dead, but...
I knew it was a lie.

17:52.371 --> 17:54.896
He put a knife up under my chin
just for asking.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.235
How could you tell Barnett wasn't dead?

18:00.512 --> 18:02.571
I saw him looking at me.

18:03.382 --> 18:05.475
I saw him blink.

18:07.352 --> 18:09.980
I'll never forget those eyes.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.127
What are you gonna do?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.690
I know what I'm not gonna do.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.465
I'm not gonna wait for Barnett
to send me another valentine.

18:27.406 --> 18:29.499
You mean the ghost of John Barnett?

18:31.343 --> 18:33.937
I didn't know you believed in ghosts, Scully.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.385
Hello?

18:48.093 --> 18:49.720
Yeah, just a minute.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.922
It's for you.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.496
Mulder.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.129
Fox Mulder.

19:00.205 --> 19:02.765
- Barnett?
- I'll run a trace.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.399
- You sound surprised.
- You know...

19:05.511 --> 19:07.536
Shouldn't I be?

19:07.613 --> 19:10.912
You know, it's illegal
to tape another's phone call

19:11.383 --> 19:13.817
without their express permission.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.978
Isn't that what they call it?

19:16.054 --> 19:17.954
In some states.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.184
What makes you think I'm taping you?

19:20.259 --> 19:23.160
Same thing makes me think
you're tracing this call.

19:23.228 --> 19:24.991
What state are you in?

19:25.063 --> 19:27.156
Same state you are!

19:29.668 --> 19:33.195
I stood next to you in line
for coffee this morning.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.802
I don't think so.

19:38.977 --> 19:42.003
Man, I'm everywhere you are.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.840
Everywhere.

19:45.284 --> 19:47.377
I own you.

19:47.452 --> 19:49.386
How do I know it's really you?

19:49.454 --> 19:52.890
What did I say to you in the courtroom?

19:55.160 --> 19:57.219
Did you ever doubt me?

19:57.296 --> 19:59.423
I don't know. What did you tell me?

19:59.498 --> 20:06.768
Huh! If you think you're gonna keep me
on this phone with this... clumsy act...

20:06.838 --> 20:09.568
Listen, by all accounts,
John Barnett is a dead man.

20:10.576 --> 20:13.977
Oh, you're the dead man, Mulder!

20:15.380 --> 20:19.578
Fine. I just need confirmation
that you are who you say you are.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.779
You want confirmation,

20:23.789 --> 20:25.848
you got it.

20:30.829 --> 20:33.491
Barnett... You there?

20:37.202 --> 20:40.194
- You lost him?
- Yeah, he was hip to the trace.

20:40.272 --> 20:41.933
Was it Barnett?

20:42.040 --> 20:46.101
John Barnett was from New Hampshire.
He had a slight accent.

20:46.211 --> 20:48.270
Listen to this.

20:51.516 --> 20:54.883
Fine. I just need confiirmation
that you are who you say you are.

20:54.953 --> 20:58.218
You want confiirmation, you got it.

21:02.227 --> 21:08.132
- What did he mean by that?
- I don't know, but that is... John Barnett.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.394
I'm sure of it.

21:23.982 --> 21:26.075
- Yeah?
- Reggie, it's Mulder.

21:26.918 --> 21:29.443
What do you want?
It's the middle of the night.

21:30.856 --> 21:32.915
It's only 10:45, Reggie.

21:32.991 --> 21:35.789
Yeah, well, I was sleeping.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.995
Listen, it doesn't look like
Barnett's dead after all.

21:39.698 --> 21:40.722
Now what?

21:41.733 --> 21:46.568
I got an inmate at the prison who swears he
saw Barnett alive the night they say he died.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.673
Mulder,

21:49.741 --> 21:51.606
go home.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.268
Get some rest.

21:53.345 --> 21:56.109
Just one thing doesn't make sense to me.

21:56.181 --> 21:57.671
What's that?

21:57.749 --> 22:01.549
Agent Henderson said that
that note left at the jewelry store

22:01.620 --> 22:05.021
- was written by a right-hander.
- Yeah. So?

22:05.123 --> 22:08.149
This inmate swears he saw
Barnett's right hand amputated.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.297
Reggie, are you there?

22:15.967 --> 22:17.093
Hey, Reggie!

22:17.169 --> 22:19.694
Reggie, what's goin' on?

22:20.238 --> 22:22.138
Are you there?

22:22.207 --> 22:24.402
What the hell's goin' on, Reggie?

22:25.977 --> 22:27.410
Reggie!

22:27.512 --> 22:29.343
What happened? Hey, Reggie!

22:29.448 --> 22:32.747
Reggie! What's going on? Are you there?

22:32.818 --> 22:35.719
What the hell's goin' on, Reggie?

22:41.460 --> 22:45.521
I hope you brought your fine-tooth comb.
I want every piece of lint analyzed.

22:45.597 --> 22:48.464
If nothing turns up, run it through again.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.194
Mulder.

22:50.268 --> 22:54.728
His wife died of cancer six years ago.
He never liked to talk about it.

22:54.806 --> 22:57.775
As long as I knew him,
he was working on a mystery novel.

22:57.843 --> 23:02.940
He promised to show me it, but he never did.
I think he was afraid I wouldn't like it.

23:03.849 --> 23:07.148
I'm probably the only guy in the Bureau
he trusted enough to even ask.

23:08.954 --> 23:09.978
I'm sorry.

23:10.055 --> 23:14.185
I'm just thinking how different
things would have been if I'd shot Barnett.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.351
Mulder,

23:16.428 --> 23:19.397
we're still not 100 per cent sure this is him.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.850
Fresh ink, slightly smeared.

23:41.853 --> 23:44.845
I hate to tell you,
and I'm not known to be wrong,

23:44.923 --> 23:49.622
but this note was most certainly written
by a right-handed person.

23:49.694 --> 23:52.629
You see the pressure points
inside the pen grooves?

23:52.697 --> 23:54.790
It's a dead giveaway.

23:56.401 --> 24:01.600
Would you be able to tell if this was written
by somebody using a prosthetic hand?

24:02.340 --> 24:04.433
Well, this fella -

24:04.509 --> 24:08.673
and I'm assuming from the cursive figures
that it is a male suspect -

24:08.747 --> 24:12.239
he has a fairly nice, fluid style.

24:12.317 --> 24:16.617
Judging from the pressure variations
in the connectors,

24:16.688 --> 24:21.751
they would need good finger dexterity.
You won't get that with a prosthesis.

24:21.860 --> 24:24.852
You think it's the same person
that wrote the first note?

24:26.898 --> 24:29.765
- This the guy you think killed Agent Purdue?
- Yeah.

24:29.868 --> 24:31.529
Know what occurred to me?

24:32.904 --> 24:36.271
You never got any prints off those notes.

24:37.275 --> 24:43.145
If this guy was wearing a glove on his
pen hand, note wouldn't be smeared like it is.

24:43.248 --> 24:44.875
For what it's worth.

24:48.954 --> 24:51.752
I was just trying to find you. Listen to this.

24:51.857 --> 24:56.123
According to the AMA, Dr Ridley,
who signed Barnett's death certificate,

24:56.194 --> 24:59.891
hasn't officially been a doctor since 1979.

25:00.599 --> 25:03.898
- What do you mean?
- His membership wasn't renewed

25:03.969 --> 25:08.167
after Maryland State revoked
his medical license for research malpractice

25:08.273 --> 25:10.537
and misuse of a government grant.

25:10.609 --> 25:14.568
- Where does it say that?
- The National Institute of Health's journal.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.408
What kind of research?

25:16.515 --> 25:21.350
He was conducting experiments on children
afflicted with a disease called progeria.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.884
The patient, you see,
is an eight-year-old girl

25:25.957 --> 25:29.154
suffering from
the advanced stages of progeria.

25:29.227 --> 25:31.127
She looks about 90.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.927
Only about 100 cases have ever been
reported, so the disease is rare.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.127
But fatal.

25:38.203 --> 25:43.766
Some patients make it to early adulthood.
Others become terminal aged seven or eight.

25:44.609 --> 25:46.099
What's the cause of death?

25:46.177 --> 25:50.204
Clinically it's cardiac or
cerebral vascular disease, but actually

25:51.182 --> 25:53.742
these poor kids die of old age.

25:54.853 --> 25:56.115
Is that Dr Ridley?

25:56.187 --> 25:59.054
Yes. In 1974.

25:59.157 --> 26:04.390
Joe Ridley thought that he could take
their accelerated ageing and slow it down.

26:05.597 --> 26:10.967
Initially, some of his lab work was promising,
but then things got out of control.

26:11.536 --> 26:13.800
He wanted to begin human trials.

26:13.939 --> 26:15.600
Why wasn't he allowed to?

26:16.675 --> 26:19.007
Because he hadn't met the criteria.

26:19.077 --> 26:22.638
It was all too hypothetical, too dangerous!
I mean...

26:23.648 --> 26:26.742
I knew Joe Ridley.
He didn't care about those kids.

26:26.818 --> 26:30.254
He talked about them
as if they were laboratory animals.

26:30.355 --> 26:34.451
This terrible disease, progeria -
he saw it as a wonderful opportunity.

26:34.559 --> 26:39.895
He used those exact words with me once.
An "opportunity" to unlock all the secrets.

26:41.066 --> 26:44.194
When they refused to allow the human trials,
he became enraged.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.632
Do you know what they called Joe Ridley
behind his back?

26:47.706 --> 26:51.642
- What?
- Dr Mengele.

26:56.081 --> 27:00.074
So how did Dr Ridley
eventually lose his medical license?

27:00.185 --> 27:02.915
He went ahead with
the human trials secretly,

27:03.021 --> 27:05.080
on an outpatient basis.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.518
When we learnt about it,
we terminated his grant

27:09.628 --> 27:12.791
and filed charges
with the state medical boards.

27:13.898 --> 27:18.801
I'm afraid your colleague Dr Ridley
has dropped off the face of the earth.

27:18.870 --> 27:23.637
Yeah, although it's rumored he went
to South America to continue his work.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.741
- You don'tjust reverse ageing.
- Ridley's found a way.

27:31.850 --> 27:36.014
He wanted human research subjects, right?
Prisoners like John Barnett.

27:36.087 --> 27:37.918
It's science fiction.

27:38.023 --> 27:42.221
What would you have said 20 years ago
about gene splicing? DNA fingerprinting?

27:42.293 --> 27:44.420
Cloning? Artificial intelligence?

27:44.496 --> 27:46.555
Maybe the man's not in his late forties.

27:46.698 --> 27:50.464
Maybe John Barnett
has found the perfect disguise: Youth.

27:57.042 --> 28:01.376
I wanna age him backwards now.
Let's start with ten years.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.539
Now five years more.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.309
And add 20 pounds.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.778
A healthy 20 pounds.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.860
Ridley's notes from the human trials at NIH

28:21.933 --> 28:27.371
indicate he didn't see ageing as inevitable,
but as an opportunistic disease.

28:28.506 --> 28:31.669
A disease that could be prevented,
reversed even,

28:31.743 --> 28:35.201
by changing the chemical cues
that trigger certain genes.

28:36.414 --> 28:41.351
However, there is no evidence whatsoever
that Ridley's work yielded any results,

28:41.419 --> 28:45.719
or that his theories,
all hope to the contrary, hold any validity.

28:59.504 --> 29:04.237
According to scientifiic journals, projections
on this kind of genetic engineering

29:04.342 --> 29:07.334
are at best speculative and futuristic.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.606
Who is it?

30:51.816 --> 30:53.875
Dr Joe Ridley.

31:27.452 --> 31:31.081
If you're really Dr Joseph Ridley,
where have you been for the past five years?

31:32.323 --> 31:35.121
I originally continued my research
in Mexico,

31:35.260 --> 31:40.926
but for the last three years I spent my time
in Central America. In Belize, to be exact.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.665
What about Barnett?

31:44.736 --> 31:48.797
He's the only patient left.
The only one who survived the experiments.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.932
What about you?

31:51.009 --> 31:53.102
My appearance is deceiving.

31:53.211 --> 31:59.013
I have no more than a month to live as I am
dying from a rare cerebral vascular disease.

32:00.351 --> 32:02.819
The disease that kills kids with progeria?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.980
That's right.

32:05.089 --> 32:08.149
An unfortunate side effect of the treatment.

32:08.226 --> 32:11.354
By using the genetic
components of progeria,

32:11.429 --> 32:16.128
I was able to reverse the ageing process
in the same way the disease expedited it.

32:16.200 --> 32:21.399
At the same time, I and my patients
became susceptible to the same ailments

32:21.506 --> 32:25.135
a child of six or eight would
if he had the disease.

32:25.209 --> 32:26.836
What about Barnett?

32:28.112 --> 32:29.739
John Barnett.

32:29.814 --> 32:32.840
If I didn't so personally detest the man,

32:32.951 --> 32:35.351
I might call him my one triumph.

32:36.154 --> 32:37.348
Barnett's not dying?

32:38.556 --> 32:41.218
Only his eyes - which, for some reason,

32:41.326 --> 32:43.920
do not respond to the gene therapy.

32:43.995 --> 32:47.055
Otherwise,
John Barnett appears to be thriving.

32:47.765 --> 32:49.562
But how?

32:51.769 --> 32:53.828
I varied Barnett's treatment.

32:53.938 --> 32:59.069
Once I isolated the progeria receptors,
I stumbled on something quite unexpected.

32:59.177 --> 33:01.873
These same genes
related to myelin production.

33:02.013 --> 33:04.880
The material that insulates
neurons in the body.

33:05.883 --> 33:07.373
Yes.

33:07.452 --> 33:09.852
Myelin is not present in the very young,

33:09.954 --> 33:13.617
and by reversing the effects of ageing
I found with Barnett,

33:13.691 --> 33:16.558
I was able to regulate
the production of myelin.

33:16.627 --> 33:20.586
Myelin being the material
that prohibits you or I from, say,

33:21.265 --> 33:26.862
regenerating a new hand
if we were to have ours... cut... off.

33:28.573 --> 33:31.269
You were able to grow
John Barnett a new hand?

33:32.643 --> 33:34.702
Not exactly.

33:35.246 --> 33:37.305
Not a human hand anyway.

33:38.049 --> 33:41.678
I could never get the cells
to divide or behave properly.

33:41.786 --> 33:43.651
I-I'm afraid to ask.

33:45.590 --> 33:49.993
- What kind of hand did you grow?
- There'd been successful work in London.

33:50.728 --> 33:53.458
By taking samples
of what we call cell morphogens

33:53.531 --> 33:58.298
from an amputated salamander arm and
applying them to the back of the creature,

33:58.403 --> 34:02.100
they could grow a new limb
on a different part of the body.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.265
But only on salamanders.

34:04.342 --> 34:07.311
- Until John Barnett?
- Yeah.

34:08.045 --> 34:11.641
- Unbelievable.
- My work has cost me dearly.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.141
I'm an outcast in the medical community.

34:15.253 --> 34:20.121
I was called Dr Mengele, Dr Frankenstein,
but I didn't care.

34:20.224 --> 34:23.159
Because you knew that
if your theories panned out...

34:25.029 --> 34:28.362
The man who owns the fountain of youth
controls the world.

34:29.300 --> 34:33.134
When the AMA censured me,
certain sponsors came out of the woodwork.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.831
One of them was the US government.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.170
They financed your research?

34:39.110 --> 34:44.275
You might be more surprised to learn how
high up the ladder this dirty little secret goes.

35:04.335 --> 35:08.294
I know why you've contacted me.
Listen and I'll explain.

35:08.372 --> 35:11.967
I am not proud of the way
in which this matter was handled,

35:12.076 --> 35:15.603
but, like it or not,
John Barnett is a fact of life.

35:16.681 --> 35:19.912
I wish Agent Purdue were around
to appreciate the irony.

35:19.984 --> 35:23.715
The government knew full well
that Barnett was in the country.

35:23.788 --> 35:28.122
You, of course, know
that Barnett stole all of Ridley's research.

35:28.192 --> 35:35.098
What Ridley doesn't know is our government
is bargaining with Barnett to buy it from him.

35:39.937 --> 35:41.564
What does he want?

35:43.407 --> 35:46.934
A lot of money, immunity, safe haven.

35:47.011 --> 35:49.104
Will he get it?

35:50.414 --> 35:53.110
He holds all the cards.

35:54.585 --> 35:59.147
You're aware that this... freak of science
you're negotiating with is a murderer?

36:01.192 --> 36:03.922
The information he has

36:04.929 --> 36:08.330
could change the course of mankind.
Consider the options.

36:10.868 --> 36:12.961
I will.

36:38.596 --> 36:41.588
Hi, this is Dana Scully.

36:41.666 --> 36:44.100
Please leave a message after the tone.

36:45.770 --> 36:48.204
Retrieving messages.

36:49.840 --> 36:54.834
Hi, Dana. It's Mom. I just wanted to call
and say hi. Um, give me a call whenever.

36:54.912 --> 36:56.607
OK, hon. Bye-bye.

36:56.681 --> 37:00.583
Hi, Dana. It's Kathy. I hope
you'll still meet me before my cello recital.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.648
What's that?

37:03.721 --> 37:07.179
It's my private answering machine,
or at least it used to be.

37:07.258 --> 37:08.520
Meaning?

37:08.626 --> 37:13.859
This morning I heard someone dialing in
my private code and replaying my messages.

37:13.931 --> 37:17.264
Last night I could have sworn
someone was in my apartment,

37:17.335 --> 37:20.998
but when Ridley knocked
I thought I'd mistaken the noise for him.

37:21.072 --> 37:26.135
- Scully...
- I took this down to Prints before I came up.

37:26.244 --> 37:30.203
John Barnett's left index oblique
is on the underside of this unit.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.512
Mulder.

37:39.123 --> 37:41.023
Barnett?

37:42.860 --> 37:45.886
Your new friend- Ridley.

37:47.698 --> 37:51.293
Don't grow too fond of him.

37:54.772 --> 37:59.038
He's gonna die soon,
like the rest of your friends.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.078
The rest of my friends?

38:02.079 --> 38:04.673
One by one.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.474
You're not that smart.

38:10.888 --> 38:15.348
Tell me, you're not gonna make me
prove it to you again, are you?

38:16.160 --> 38:20.927
Oh, well, no matter.
It'll be your turn soon enough.

38:22.266 --> 38:24.359
But you won't get that chance.

38:25.503 --> 38:27.562
Oh, no?

38:30.107 --> 38:32.166
Who's gonna stop me, huh?

38:33.210 --> 38:36.373
Man! This is... this is the land of the free!

38:39.550 --> 38:41.814
Well, I'm just checking in.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.114
Bye...

38:45.189 --> 38:47.316
for now.

38:51.595 --> 38:54.086
What does Barnett know
from your messages?

38:54.165 --> 38:59.694
That my mother called for no reason and
I'm meeting a friend before her cello recital.

39:00.371 --> 39:02.430
Where's that?

39:05.376 --> 39:10.404
We're working at a disadvantage because we
don't know exactly what Barnett looks like.

39:10.514 --> 39:13.347
Study each of these faces. Know them.

39:13.417 --> 39:17.410
- Particularly the eyes.
- I'm including a diagram of the theater.

39:17.555 --> 39:21.013
You have six front entrances
and four more backstage.

39:21.125 --> 39:26.119
If he shows he'll key on Scully, so wherever
she is, she should not leave your sight.

39:26.230 --> 39:30.189
We've got two hours before the performance.
Know this place inside and out.

39:30.267 --> 39:34.966
We don't want any shots fired, if
we can help it. We want to take Barnett alive.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.234
OK?

39:37.341 --> 39:39.206
How you feelin'?

39:39.276 --> 39:42.040
This is the first time
I've ever played the target.

39:42.179 --> 39:44.875
Well, let's make sure it's not the last time.

41:23.514 --> 41:24.572
Gun!

41:27.384 --> 41:28.282
Down!

41:36.293 --> 41:37.191
Check her out!

41:49.540 --> 41:51.599
Get back, Mulder! Shut up!

41:52.176 --> 41:54.701
Back off! Back off!

41:55.346 --> 41:57.211
Don't even think about it.

41:59.016 --> 42:00.506
Just let her go.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.384
Go ahead and shoot!

42:03.487 --> 42:06.718
Go ahead, man! Shoot, Mulder.

42:06.824 --> 42:08.917
What are you afraid of, huh?

42:08.993 --> 42:11.689
What? It's against regulations, huh?

42:12.363 --> 42:14.558
No, man, you need me alive, don't you?

42:14.632 --> 42:18.090
Cos I'm the only one
who knows where the research is, huh?

42:19.169 --> 42:21.228
So I could shoot her

42:21.338 --> 42:24.034
and you just have to live with it,
don't you, huh?

42:24.542 --> 42:25.531
Shut up!

42:28.612 --> 42:30.705
How about it, Mulder?

42:31.515 --> 42:33.574
Just like old times, huh?

42:49.767 --> 42:52.031
- Call an ambulance!
- I'll do it!

42:52.136 --> 42:56.630
Hear me? It's OK, Scully.
An ambulance is on the way.

42:56.774 --> 42:59.242
Easy. You all right?

43:05.816 --> 43:07.875
Don't try to move.

43:13.791 --> 43:15.850
Where are they?

43:15.960 --> 43:18.292
Can you hear me? Barnett?

43:18.395 --> 43:20.454
Where did you hide them?

43:24.668 --> 43:28.001
- How you feeling?
- Like somebody kicked me in the ribs.

43:28.072 --> 43:31.803
The bullet went through eight layers
of Kevlar. You're lucky to be alive.

43:34.244 --> 43:36.109
What about him?

43:36.213 --> 43:38.909
They flew in three specialists to save his life.

43:39.016 --> 43:41.507
That guy in the ugly suit is probably CIA.

43:41.652 --> 43:44.052
He's been trying to talk to him.

43:44.121 --> 43:47.386
- Is Barnett conscious?
- Yeah, but he's not talking.

43:53.297 --> 43:56.733
Mulder, I know what you did
wasn't by the book.

43:56.834 --> 43:59.098
Tells you a lot about the book, doesn't it?

44:08.012 --> 44:10.606
Where is it? Barnett! Come on!

44:10.681 --> 44:12.649
Where are the papers?

44:14.551 --> 44:16.815
50 over palp. Vitals dropping.

44:16.887 --> 44:19.355
- OK, we're gonna have to hit him.
- Intubate.

44:19.456 --> 44:21.856
Come on! Come on! Shock him.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.853
Shock him now!

44:25.896 --> 44:27.955
Got no pulse, no rhythm.

44:31.068 --> 44:32.729
They lost him.

44:34.238 --> 44:37.674
Bastard'll take that research
with him to the grave.

44:39.076 --> 44:40.737
Where do you think it is?

44:43.847 --> 44:45.712
Who knows?

44:45.783 --> 44:49.310
If Barnett didn't destroy it,
he could have stashed it anywhere.

44:49.386 --> 44:51.752
Which would have a certain cruel irony.

44:51.855 --> 44:55.291
Scientifiic knowledge
that could change the course of mankind

44:55.359 --> 44:59.955
buried out in a fiield somewhere,
or sitting in some safe-deposit box,

45:00.064 --> 45:02.328
getting old just like the rest of us.

45:02.466 --> 45:07.733
If he didn't destroy it, chances are
somehow, someday, somebody will fiind it.

45:07.805 --> 45:12.401
And when they do, maybe he didn't
get his revenge from beyond the grave,

45:12.509 --> 45:16.673
but somehow I feel like
we haven't heard the last from John Barnett.
