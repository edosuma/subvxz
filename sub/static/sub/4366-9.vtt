WEBVTT

00:01.318 --> 00:03.113
You are being watched...

00:04.024 --> 00:06.084
The government has
a secret system,

00:06.273 --> 00:07.425
a machine

00:07.684 --> 00:10.168
that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.862 --> 00:12.107
I know because...

00:12.213 --> 00:13.254
I built it.

00:13.591 --> 00:15.776
I designed the machine to
detect acts of terror,

00:15.856 --> 00:17.136
but it sees everything...

00:17.138 --> 00:19.922
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:19.924 --> 00:21.357
people like you,

00:21.359 --> 00:25.027
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:25.029 --> 00:28.381
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:28.383 --> 00:30.249
But I needed a partner--

00:30.251 --> 00:32.952
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:32.954 --> 00:37.156
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:37.158 --> 00:39.108
You will never find us.

00:39.110 --> 00:41.110
But victim or perpetrator,

00:41.112 --> 00:44.046
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

01:03.137 --> 01:04.465
He's all yours.

01:05.903 --> 01:09.021
I already told
the other Americans...

01:09.023 --> 01:11.741
I deliver
fruits and vegetables.

01:11.743 --> 01:13.192
You deliver explosives
for Al-Qaeda.

01:13.194 --> 01:15.945
Your cell is responsible
for a suicide bomb

01:15.947 --> 01:18.647
that killed three U.S. soldiers
in Fallujah.

01:18.649 --> 01:20.216
You should tell me the location

01:20.218 --> 01:23.035
of the remainder
of those explosives.

01:23.037 --> 01:24.837
Talk to me,

01:24.839 --> 01:28.541
or else you're gonna have
to talk to my boss.

01:28.543 --> 01:29.992
And believe me when I tell you,

01:29.994 --> 01:33.129
you don't want to talk
to my boss.

01:34.932 --> 01:36.265
All right.

01:45.108 --> 01:47.476
Hello, Yusuf.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.501
Getting too close--
Enough already.

01:55.503 --> 01:56.786
She goes...Today.

01:56.788 --> 01:59.372
But it's got to be clean.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.757
You can't keep coming
in here like this.

02:01.759 --> 02:03.325
I gotta go.
Detective Carter?

02:03.327 --> 02:05.294
It's Mrs. Kovach here
to bail out her husband.

02:05.296 --> 02:06.262
Again?

02:06.264 --> 02:08.014
Figured maybe
you could talk to her.

02:08.015 --> 02:09.681
Thanks.

02:12.636 --> 02:16.839
I work homicide,
Mrs. Kovach, okay?

02:16.841 --> 02:18.808
I'm the one who ha
to investigate it

02:18.810 --> 02:22.228
when your husband finally
beats you to death.

02:28.652 --> 02:31.520
Look, every time you tell us
it was an accident,

02:31.522 --> 02:34.356
you're strengthening
the story he's gonna use

02:34.358 --> 02:37.359
to get out of it--
That you were clumsy,

02:37.361 --> 02:39.528
accident-prone.

02:39.530 --> 02:42.999
Do you hear me?

02:43.001 --> 02:46.419
The stairs.

02:46.421 --> 02:48.504
I fell down the stairs.

02:53.844 --> 02:56.211
If he puts his hands
on you again,

02:56.213 --> 02:57.546
call me.

03:00.684 --> 03:04.403
Sorry.
I have to go.

03:08.325 --> 03:10.242
I don't know
why you bother, Carter.

03:10.244 --> 03:11.393
You can't save 'em all.

03:11.395 --> 03:13.579
That's a homicide
waiting to happen.

03:13.581 --> 03:16.248
Figured I'd try to stop one
for a change.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.367
DNA came back on the shooter
you winged a couple weeks ago.

03:18.369 --> 03:20.036
The guy who took a shot at you.

03:20.038 --> 03:23.539
Half the DNA
matched Marlene Elias...

03:23.541 --> 03:26.292
The other half...
Don Moretti.

03:27.761 --> 03:31.964
Carl Elias-- The bastard son
you left to rot in the system

03:31.966 --> 03:35.051
after you murdered his mother
almost 40 years ago.

03:35.053 --> 03:36.251
Your mistress.

03:36.253 --> 03:37.920
I told you before, sweetheart.

03:37.922 --> 03:41.440
I ain't the father
of nobody by that name.

03:41.442 --> 03:43.275
DNA says otherwise, Don.

03:43.277 --> 03:45.444
You're a perfect match.

03:45.446 --> 03:46.779
And guess what.

03:46.781 --> 03:49.148
Your son's all grown up now.

03:49.150 --> 03:53.953
Just a few
of his recent victims.

03:53.955 --> 03:56.872
Retired Detective
Bernie Sullivan,

03:56.874 --> 03:59.959
your old capo Vincent Deluca.

04:03.246 --> 04:05.447
What is this?
What do I care?

04:05.449 --> 04:07.500
I'm gonna die
an old man in here.

04:07.502 --> 04:09.301
Maybe sooner than you think.

04:09.303 --> 04:11.671
You killed his mother,
and you left him to the wolves.

04:11.673 --> 04:15.307
What do you think
he's gonna do to you?

04:15.309 --> 04:19.394
I wouldn't expect
any father's day cards.

04:19.397 --> 04:21.480
If you help me,

04:21.482 --> 04:24.400
I can offer you
protective custody.

04:24.402 --> 04:27.302
Who do you think
you're talking to?

04:27.304 --> 04:30.773
You don't get it.
Elias can get to you anywhere.

04:30.775 --> 04:34.694
He can find someone you know,
turn them on you.

04:34.696 --> 04:35.811
And you know what?

04:35.813 --> 04:37.646
It's not a question of if,
but when.

04:37.648 --> 04:41.150
Telling me this guy
already took out a cop,

04:41.152 --> 04:44.086
took a shot at you
'cause you got too close,

04:44.088 --> 04:48.674
and you came here
to warn me, huh?

04:48.676 --> 04:51.160
Consider it a courtesy call.

04:53.180 --> 04:56.215
There a task force
going after this Elias,

04:56.217 --> 04:58.684
or is it just you, detective?

04:58.686 --> 05:00.186
What is that supposed to mean?

05:00.188 --> 05:04.440
Way it looks from my side
of the fence, you're all alone.

05:04.442 --> 05:08.144
Sounds to me like maybe
he's coming after you.

05:14.785 --> 05:16.952
All units respond--

05:16.954 --> 05:19.071
Shooting at 168th and Audubon.

05:19.073 --> 05:21.407
I came as soon as I heard
the description.

05:21.409 --> 05:23.492
Yeah, got a young
African-American male

05:23.494 --> 05:24.710
gunned down on his way home.

05:24.712 --> 05:25.995
I got 9-millimeter casings
all over the curb.

05:25.997 --> 05:27.863
Looks like
it was a drive-by.

05:27.865 --> 05:29.665
Any witnesses see the car?

05:29.667 --> 05:32.334
In this neighborhood?
You're kidding, right?

05:34.222 --> 05:37.556
- Ronnie Middleton.
- You knew this kid?

05:37.558 --> 05:40.426
He witnessed a shooting
six months ago up in the Bronx.

05:40.428 --> 05:43.729
ID'd the shooter-- Neighborhood
thug Hector Alvarez.

05:43.731 --> 05:45.381
- This kid was a snitch?
- Yeah.

05:45.383 --> 05:48.684
He got cold feet though.
Recanted his testimony.

05:48.686 --> 05:50.269
D.A. Dropped the case.

05:50.271 --> 05:51.821
Looks like Hector found him.

05:51.823 --> 05:53.606
He won't get away
with it again.

05:53.608 --> 05:55.241
Was Ronnie carrying?

05:55.243 --> 05:59.378
Yeah, just a, uh, cell phone,
and that soda bottle.

05:59.380 --> 06:02.248
Mariquitas Cola?

06:02.250 --> 06:04.900
Mexican soda.

06:04.902 --> 06:06.585
They don't sell that
everywhere.

06:06.587 --> 06:10.923
I think I know
a place that does.

06:10.925 --> 06:13.209
And I know
somebody saw something.

06:13.211 --> 06:15.294
Yeah, getting them to talk
is another matter.

06:15.296 --> 06:17.880
I'm sure you'll charm
something out of them, Fusco.

06:17.882 --> 06:19.799
You know, Carter,

06:19.801 --> 06:21.717
we've been working together
for a while now.

06:21.719 --> 06:24.436
My friends call me "Lionel."
You got a first name?

06:24.438 --> 06:27.189
Sure.
"Detective."

06:28.591 --> 06:32.144
My name's Detective Fusco
with the NYPD.

06:32.146 --> 06:33.779
If anyone has seen
or heard anything

06:33.781 --> 06:35.314
pertaining to what happened
here tonight,

06:35.316 --> 06:37.983
you can call me at--

06:37.985 --> 06:39.735
- I already have
your card, Lionel.

06:39.737 --> 06:42.037
What the hell
are you doing here?

06:42.039 --> 06:43.322
Just checking in.

06:43.324 --> 06:45.825
What happened here?

06:45.827 --> 06:47.326
Lead poisoning.

06:47.328 --> 06:49.829
It's going
around the neighborhood.

06:52.799 --> 06:54.750
NYPD, mister...?

06:54.752 --> 06:57.052
Castillo.
I'm-- I'm closed for the night.

06:57.054 --> 06:59.054
You see what happened
out here tonight, Mr. Castillo?

06:59.056 --> 07:00.422
I was busy in the back.

07:00.424 --> 07:03.509
I-I-I didn't hear anything
till the police showed up.

07:03.511 --> 07:06.095
See, I find that hard
to believe, Mr. Castillo.

07:06.097 --> 07:09.064
After that young man bought
this Mariquitas soda

07:09.066 --> 07:11.433
from your store...

07:11.435 --> 07:14.904
He walked out and got shot
like a dog in the street.

07:17.107 --> 07:19.408
He bought the soda.
He left the store.

07:19.410 --> 07:21.327
I heard the shots,
but-- but I didn't see anything.

07:21.329 --> 07:22.912
Okay, so you heard shots.

07:22.914 --> 07:25.080
You didn't look out,
see a car take off?

07:25.082 --> 07:27.533
Please...

07:27.535 --> 07:29.418
Not here.

07:29.420 --> 07:31.704
I understand.

07:31.706 --> 07:32.955
Why don't you come down

07:32.957 --> 07:34.840
to the precinct tomorrow,
give a statement?

07:34.842 --> 07:35.991
Just what you saw.

07:35.993 --> 07:38.794
Okay, I'll come down tomorrow.

07:48.972 --> 07:51.106
Mr. Reese?
Where have you been?

07:51.108 --> 07:53.225
We've got another number.

07:53.227 --> 07:55.444
If you're gonna
tell me Ronnie Middleton,

07:55.446 --> 07:56.478
you're a little late, Finch.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.446
Kid's already gone.

07:57.448 --> 07:59.565
What?
Where are you?

07:59.567 --> 08:02.017
At the scene of a homicide,

08:02.019 --> 08:03.852
wondering how
the machine can see one

08:03.854 --> 08:04.937
and miss another.

08:04.939 --> 08:06.238
I'm sorry, Mr. Reese.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.625
The machine detects acts
of premeditation.

08:09.627 --> 08:11.327
And I'm afraid we've got
a big problem

08:11.329 --> 08:13.162
with the one
it's seeing right now.

08:13.164 --> 08:15.798
Whose number came up?

08:15.800 --> 08:18.217
Mutual friend of ours...

08:19.869 --> 08:22.087
Detective Carter.

08:39.328 --> 08:41.828
Want to tell me
where you were last night?

08:41.831 --> 08:43.648
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

08:43.650 --> 08:45.950
- Working a new case.
- There you go.

08:45.952 --> 08:47.335
Thank you.

08:47.337 --> 08:49.253
And I don't have the curfew.

08:49.255 --> 08:51.372
You weren't home when I called,

08:51.374 --> 08:53.073
and you didn't answer
your cell, Taylor.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.675
I was only a half an hour late.

08:54.677 --> 08:56.410
Yeah. You're staying
with grandma

08:56.412 --> 08:58.096
till I'm off this case.

08:58.098 --> 08:59.597
- Hey, Taylor.
- Mmm.

09:03.770 --> 09:06.687
So I saw you got that,
uh, homecoming dance

09:06.689 --> 09:07.755
coming up Friday.

09:07.757 --> 09:09.607
You gonna go?

09:09.609 --> 09:11.809
Yeah, it must be tough
being a freshman.

09:11.811 --> 09:13.895
All the girls going out
with the older guys.

09:13.897 --> 09:16.430
I already asked somebody.

09:16.432 --> 09:18.282
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:18.284 --> 09:19.617
Well, I want to meet her.

09:19.619 --> 09:21.068
- I'm gonna be late for school.
- Uh-uh.

09:21.070 --> 09:22.320
I'm taking you.
I have time.

09:22.322 --> 09:24.739
Stay.

09:24.741 --> 09:27.942
I thought I charged this thing.

09:27.944 --> 09:30.044
- After you.
- Thank you.

09:30.046 --> 09:32.079
Raised you well.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.552
Did you know she had a son?

09:37.554 --> 09:38.836
Didn't know you cared.

09:38.838 --> 09:41.172
No dad in the picture
for some time.

09:41.174 --> 09:44.976
You been looking
into the detective, Mr. Reese?

09:44.978 --> 09:47.595
It pays to know the person
coming after you, Finch.

09:47.597 --> 09:51.315
Okay, they're leaving now.
You'd better hurry up.

09:51.317 --> 09:52.299
Almost got it.

09:52.301 --> 09:55.570
Forget it.
Get out of there now.

10:00.492 --> 10:03.778
Do we have picture?

10:03.780 --> 10:06.747
And a GPS tracker.

10:06.749 --> 10:08.249
Nice work, Harold.

10:08.251 --> 10:10.134
We need eyes and ears
on her 24-7,

10:10.136 --> 10:11.819
even inside the precinct.

10:18.494 --> 10:23.047
Finch, Carter's going
right into Hector's shop.

10:23.049 --> 10:25.666
Primary suspect in
the Ronnie Middleton shooting.

10:25.668 --> 10:28.970
How's the car business, Hector?

10:31.807 --> 10:34.025
You say that like
you really care, detective.

10:34.027 --> 10:35.693
Care about where
you were last night.

10:35.695 --> 10:38.679
Go ahead, spin that yarn,
dazzle me.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.482
Sorry.
I'm a domesticated man.

10:41.484 --> 10:44.368
I was back with my old lady,
watching some show.

10:44.370 --> 10:46.687
- Ask her.
- Of course.

10:46.689 --> 10:50.041
Always with the loyal alibi.

10:50.043 --> 10:52.860
You know, Monica, he's handsome,
but you can do better.

10:52.862 --> 10:55.379
You got some <i>huevos</i> coming
down here all alone, lady.

10:55.381 --> 10:57.215
So that wasn't your muscle car

10:57.217 --> 10:59.250
took a detour into
Washington Heights last night?

10:59.252 --> 11:01.702
Nah, I hear
it's dangerous down there.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.337
I know y'all heard

11:03.339 --> 11:06.007
what happened
to Ronnie Middleton.

11:06.009 --> 11:09.894
I heard he ate a bullet
that didn't agree with him.

11:09.896 --> 11:14.381
Nice shop, nice tools.

11:14.383 --> 11:17.401
Doing well for yourself,
Hector.

11:17.403 --> 11:19.520
You make all this money
fixing up old cars?

11:19.522 --> 11:21.789
I got a record.
I got to work for myself.

11:21.791 --> 11:23.824
This is a nice ride.
You mind if I check it out?

11:23.826 --> 11:25.660
Sure as hell do.

11:25.662 --> 11:28.279
You're gonna need
a warrant for that.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.668
You messed up,
taking that kid out, Hector.

11:33.670 --> 11:35.920
It's a shame
what happened to that kid...

11:35.922 --> 11:38.072
Even if he was
a punk-ass snitch.

11:38.074 --> 11:40.741
You won't get away
with it again.

11:40.743 --> 11:44.462
I will find a way
to bring you down.

11:44.464 --> 11:48.683
Good luck with
that warrant, detective.

11:57.726 --> 12:01.479
Didn't know
you collected dolls, Finch.

12:01.481 --> 12:04.865
As you know, I collect
rare books, Mr. Reese.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.484
180-gram vinyl

12:06.486 --> 12:10.771
and a Xerox Alto
when I can find one.

12:10.773 --> 12:14.659
This doll is
for Detective Fusco.

12:14.661 --> 12:16.494
Fusco's into dolls?

12:16.496 --> 12:19.780
He is now, if we want to
keep eyes on Detective Carter.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.799
I'll make sure
it lands on his desk.

12:21.801 --> 12:26.337
I've been looking
into our new number.

12:26.339 --> 12:30.091
Carter, detective first grade,
homicide task force.

12:30.093 --> 12:31.842
Single mom, teenage son,

12:31.844 --> 12:34.645
served as an army interrogator.

12:34.647 --> 12:35.796
Passed the bar in '04,

12:35.798 --> 12:37.348
gave it up to go back
on the force.

12:37.350 --> 12:40.001
- It's impressive, Mr. Reese.
- Impressive lady.

12:40.003 --> 12:41.268
Honest to a fault.

12:41.270 --> 12:43.237
Which means she made
a lot of enemies,

12:43.239 --> 12:45.923
both in the criminal world
and in her own department.

12:45.925 --> 12:47.641
I've narrowed the list
of possible suspects

12:47.643 --> 12:51.912
to a little over 300 or so.

12:51.914 --> 12:53.748
Day in the life
of a homicide detective.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.499
Any more immediate threats?

12:57.836 --> 13:00.604
Hector Alvarez...

13:00.606 --> 13:01.956
Indicted for homicide

13:01.958 --> 13:04.208
on a case she worked
six months ago...

13:04.210 --> 13:05.593
Till the charges were dropped.

13:05.595 --> 13:09.296
Edward Kovach--
Repeat felon, spouse abuser,

13:09.298 --> 13:11.349
whose wife she's taken
a keen interest in protecting.

13:11.351 --> 13:12.666
And then there's Elias--

13:12.668 --> 13:14.785
Ruthless killer,
organized crime boss,

13:14.787 --> 13:16.937
who's already taken
a shot at her.

13:16.939 --> 13:18.356
Well, she's a walking target.

13:18.358 --> 13:20.674
Gonna have to keep her
in sight at all times.

13:20.676 --> 13:21.842
You have to be careful.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.644
Get too close,
you risk getting caught.

13:23.646 --> 13:25.863
That's a chance I got to take.

13:25.865 --> 13:27.982
What am I supposed to do,
let her catch a bullet?

13:27.984 --> 13:29.533
What will you do
if she catches you?

13:29.535 --> 13:33.520
Well, I'm sure you'll figure
something out, Harold.

13:47.386 --> 13:48.719
What the hell?

13:54.342 --> 13:56.010
Detective Fusco.

13:56.012 --> 13:58.145
Happy birthday, Lionel.

13:58.147 --> 14:00.931
Thanks, but no thanks.
It's not my birthday.

14:00.933 --> 14:03.067
I don't know what the hell
you're trying to tell me here.

14:03.069 --> 14:05.686
Just putt on your desk
and face it towards Carter.

14:05.688 --> 14:07.054
Why?

14:07.056 --> 14:08.388
'Cause there's a camera inside,

14:08.390 --> 14:10.825
and we need to know
everyone she's talking to.

14:12.110 --> 14:15.329
You know something I don't?

14:15.331 --> 14:18.532
- She in trouble?
- Well, you tell me.

14:18.534 --> 14:20.501
Ask around with some
of your corrupt pals

14:20.503 --> 14:21.752
inside the force.

14:21.754 --> 14:23.788
Hey, what's going on?
What do you need?

14:23.790 --> 14:25.623
I need to find out
who might want

14:25.625 --> 14:26.891
- to take Carter out.
- Whoa, wait a minute.

14:26.893 --> 14:28.676
I can't be involved
in something like that.

14:28.678 --> 14:31.879
No, Lionel, just turn
the camera towards her desk.

14:33.932 --> 14:37.017
Nice doll.

14:37.019 --> 14:41.305
Yeah, my, uh--
My son gave it to me.

14:41.307 --> 14:43.390
How'd it go with the old Don
at the big house?

14:43.392 --> 14:44.642
Tried to reach out,

14:44.644 --> 14:46.977
see what he knew
about his biological son.

14:46.979 --> 14:50.531
- Elias, huh?
- Old man just shut me down.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.817
Seems to think
every cop is dirty.

14:52.819 --> 14:55.319
Yeah.

14:55.321 --> 14:56.987
Maybe back in his day.

14:56.989 --> 14:59.323
That bodega owner Castillo
come in yet?

14:59.325 --> 15:01.158
- Not that I know of.
- Huh.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.961
Gonna have to pay him
another visit.

15:03.963 --> 15:05.412
You coming?

15:05.414 --> 15:06.714
Nah, you know what?

15:06.716 --> 15:08.632
Why don't you, uh, go ahead?
I-I got a thing.

15:08.634 --> 15:10.284
I'll catch up
with you later, okay?

15:10.286 --> 15:12.253
Okay.

15:24.984 --> 15:26.784
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:26.786 --> 15:28.319
- Come here.
- Yo, I ain't done nothing.

15:28.321 --> 15:30.321
- Hands where I can see 'em.
- Get off.

15:30.323 --> 15:32.472
Got any needles?
Anything that's gonna stick me?

15:32.474 --> 15:34.641
This is violation
of my civil liberties.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.160
Finch, I don't like
the looks of this.

15:36.162 --> 15:37.411
Aah!

15:37.413 --> 15:39.446
Bitch, you better
get your hands off me.

15:39.448 --> 15:42.666
Shut up and get your head down.

15:42.668 --> 15:46.203
Yo, thanks for making it
look good, detective.

15:46.205 --> 15:47.872
I think I tweaked
my wrist, man.

15:47.874 --> 15:50.374
That was a little
too theatrical, Bottlecap.

15:50.376 --> 15:51.642
- Hey--
- Wait a minute, Reese.

15:51.644 --> 15:52.843
I think she knows him.

15:52.845 --> 15:54.345
It's all for show.

15:54.347 --> 15:56.580
Must be one of her CIS.

15:56.582 --> 15:58.632
That's 'cause
after I last got popped,

15:58.634 --> 16:01.018
I used my time
to rehabilitate myself.

16:01.020 --> 16:02.219
You got clean?

16:02.221 --> 16:04.305
- Come on now, BC.
- I'm serious.

16:04.307 --> 16:06.106
These pipes are junk-free.

16:06.108 --> 16:08.025
But I can always use
some scratch,

16:08.027 --> 16:09.109
you know what I'm saying?

16:09.111 --> 16:11.028
I need to know
what you've heard

16:11.030 --> 16:14.815
about the new guy Elias.

16:14.817 --> 16:18.518
Yeah, I've been hearing
that name up and coming a lot.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.820
I never seen him,

16:19.822 --> 16:23.874
but I-I hear he's a man
not to be trifled with.

16:23.876 --> 16:26.911
You, um, know anything
about that shooting last night

16:26.913 --> 16:28.579
over on 168th and Audubon?

16:28.581 --> 16:30.464
Drive-by, right?

16:30.466 --> 16:32.699
I know the block,
just not the players.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.919
You ever hear the name
Hector Alvarez come up

16:34.921 --> 16:37.721
or see him cruise
the block in his GTO?

16:37.723 --> 16:41.708
I didn't see the car or hear
nobody talk about Hector,

16:41.710 --> 16:43.761
but I can ask around.

16:43.763 --> 16:45.846
Good looking out, BC.

16:45.848 --> 16:49.883
If you get anything back
on, um, Hector or Elias,

16:49.885 --> 16:53.404
there's more
where that came from.

17:01.363 --> 17:02.830
Hey, captain.

17:02.832 --> 17:04.731
Welcome back, detective.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.567
Didn't think you'd grace us
with your presence again

17:07.569 --> 17:10.671
once you spent time
with the perfumed folk downtown.

17:11.840 --> 17:13.624
How'd a half-wit like you
pull that off?

17:13.626 --> 17:15.960
I guess the half's still
got some juice, huh, captain?

17:17.246 --> 17:19.246
They got me working
with Detective Carter,

17:19.248 --> 17:20.763
and, uh...

17:20.766 --> 17:22.516
I'm starting
to hear some things.

17:22.518 --> 17:24.935
Yeah?
Like what?

17:24.936 --> 17:26.686
Maybe she's not
so well-liked

17:26.689 --> 17:29.857
by, uh, a certain element.

17:29.859 --> 17:32.776
Listen, Lionel...

17:32.778 --> 17:34.695
Things are going back
to the way they used to be.

17:34.697 --> 17:36.146
Used to be?

17:36.148 --> 17:38.616
Thing about organized crime?
It was organized.

17:38.618 --> 17:41.735
Things worked.
Trains ran on time.

17:41.737 --> 17:44.538
This new guy...

17:44.540 --> 17:45.823
He knows the rules.

17:45.825 --> 17:48.492
New guy--
You mean Elias.

17:48.494 --> 17:50.878
Runs a tight ship...

17:50.880 --> 17:52.296
Low profile.

17:52.298 --> 17:54.581
Not like these cutthroat
Russian idiots.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.283
He knows who to grease...

17:56.285 --> 17:58.618
All the way up to city hall.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.888
Look, the economy's
in the toilet.

18:00.890 --> 18:04.091
Detective Carter
doesn't understand the rules.

18:04.093 --> 18:07.111
She's bad for business.

18:07.113 --> 18:09.179
- What'd she do?
- Sniffing around...

18:09.181 --> 18:10.981
Trying to build a case.

18:10.983 --> 18:14.518
She's gunning for Elias.
She's got to go.

18:15.987 --> 18:17.738
It's a tricky business,
getting rid of a cop.

18:17.740 --> 18:20.741
Went through
the proper back channels...

18:20.743 --> 18:23.277
Up the chain of command.

18:23.279 --> 18:24.695
Permission granted.

18:24.697 --> 18:26.580
It's just got to look...

18:26.582 --> 18:27.865
Clean.

18:27.867 --> 18:29.583
"Clean"?

18:29.585 --> 18:32.986
You mean like
in the line of duty?

18:32.988 --> 18:36.590
I'm starting to feel caught
in the middle here, captain.

18:36.592 --> 18:39.426
I'd keep my distance,
if I were you.

18:49.504 --> 18:52.206
You didn't come down
to the precinct

18:52.208 --> 18:54.975
like you told me you would,
Mr. Castillo.

18:54.977 --> 18:57.677
I got no help today.
I'm a very busy man.

18:57.679 --> 19:00.230
Did you see this car
before or after the shooting?

19:00.232 --> 19:03.400
You didn't tell me that
the guy that they killed

19:03.402 --> 19:05.352
was a witness
to another shooting.

19:05.354 --> 19:08.072
He decided not to testify.
Didn't save him.

19:08.074 --> 19:10.040
If you think
that's gonna convince me to,

19:10.042 --> 19:11.709
- it's not helping.
- The point is...

19:11.711 --> 19:15.579
If Hector Alvarez thinks
you saw him shoot someone,

19:15.581 --> 19:17.715
he's gonna come after you too.

19:17.717 --> 19:20.918
Please.
Look, I have a family.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.252
Exactly.

19:22.254 --> 19:24.054
If you help me,

19:24.056 --> 19:26.306
I can protect you
and your family.

19:26.308 --> 19:28.842
If you don't...

19:28.844 --> 19:32.379
He could still come after you.

19:32.381 --> 19:34.314
What's the word, Lionel?

19:34.316 --> 19:36.934
I did some checking around.

19:36.936 --> 19:39.937
Carter's name came up
and not in a good way.

19:39.939 --> 19:41.888
Elias wants her gone...
Today.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.941
Killing a cop
brings a lot of heat.

19:43.943 --> 19:46.110
Yeah, which is why they're
gonna make it look clean.

19:46.112 --> 19:47.861
He could set up a patsy
or pay someone off

19:47.863 --> 19:49.947
on a case she's working.

19:49.949 --> 19:52.166
All I know is, every door
that Carter walks through

19:52.168 --> 19:53.617
could have a bullet behind it.

19:53.619 --> 19:58.255
Did you see this guy
in your store last night?

19:58.257 --> 20:01.708
Please.
That's all I need.

20:06.214 --> 20:07.581
I saw him earlier.

20:07.583 --> 20:12.219
He's been in my store before,
to buy condoms, beer.

20:12.221 --> 20:13.470
What does it mater?

20:13.472 --> 20:15.189
I'm not gonna give you
a statement anyways.

20:15.191 --> 20:18.058
- Can you please leave my store?
- Okay.

20:18.060 --> 20:21.311
Okay.
Thank you.

20:27.236 --> 20:29.653
Oh, sorry, detective.

20:29.655 --> 20:32.239
I didn't realize
that was you from behind.

20:32.241 --> 20:34.374
Lot of fine girls out today.

20:34.376 --> 20:36.043
Keep it moving, lover boy.

20:36.045 --> 20:37.828
You got to be careful
on this block.

20:37.830 --> 20:41.248
I heard some kid
got popped last night.

20:41.250 --> 20:44.168
You got any kids, detective?

20:46.254 --> 20:47.454
Stay off this block.

20:47.456 --> 20:50.224
I see this car roll by
one more time,

20:50.226 --> 20:51.475
I'm gonna impound it.

20:51.477 --> 20:54.094
I'll be seeing you around,
Mr. Castillo.

20:57.516 --> 21:00.184
Get out of here.

21:00.186 --> 21:02.236
Let's go.

21:14.752 --> 21:16.336
Elias wants Carter gone.

21:16.338 --> 21:19.039
Possible he'll use
someone with motive...

21:19.041 --> 21:22.242
The suspect in one
of her cases.

21:24.879 --> 21:26.196
Carter's at a bar.

21:26.198 --> 21:28.048
I thought she was on duty.

21:28.050 --> 21:30.383
With this many people
after her,

21:30.385 --> 21:32.969
I'd be inclined
to pick up the tab.

21:36.273 --> 21:39.025
Tell me, Eddie...

21:39.027 --> 21:41.861
What kind of degenerate
does that to his wife?

21:41.863 --> 21:44.030
Carter's paying Kovach a visit.

21:44.032 --> 21:47.567
Why is a homicide detective
intervening in a domestic case?

21:47.569 --> 21:49.185
Maybe she's like us.

21:49.187 --> 21:51.821
Trying to prevent
something bad from happening.

21:54.542 --> 21:57.377
What happens between a man and
his woman behind closed doors

21:57.379 --> 21:59.212
is none of your damn business.

21:59.214 --> 22:01.214
Can't stop you
from boozing your life away.

22:01.216 --> 22:04.334
But you go home and put
your hands on your wife again,

22:04.336 --> 22:05.585
I'm coming after you.

22:05.587 --> 22:07.387
You come after me,

22:07.389 --> 22:11.424
and I will exercise
my second amendment rights.

22:11.426 --> 22:15.762
And I promise you,
I got a pretty big gun.

22:15.764 --> 22:19.566
Man as angry
and bitter as you are...

22:21.185 --> 22:25.989
I got a feeling
it ain't that big, Eddie.

22:28.659 --> 22:32.328
I got to admit, Finch,
I sure like her style.

22:32.330 --> 22:36.449
I think we got
a new front-runner.

22:40.237 --> 22:42.956
Mark Thomson,

22:42.958 --> 22:45.074
Ricky Lopez,

22:45.076 --> 22:47.177
Joseph McNally...

22:47.179 --> 22:50.880
All were killed
from a suicide vest

22:50.882 --> 22:53.383
you helped transport.

22:53.385 --> 22:56.136
They had families...

22:56.138 --> 22:58.488
People that loved them.

22:58.490 --> 23:01.357
I'm sorry for the soldiers,

23:01.359 --> 23:03.326
but I deliver vegetables.

23:03.328 --> 23:07.997
I know you're working
with Al-Qaeda, Yusuf...

23:07.999 --> 23:09.599
'Cause I have photos here

23:09.601 --> 23:12.602
of you loading vests
into your truck.

23:12.604 --> 23:14.904
Now, you want to tell me

23:14.906 --> 23:17.657
all these photos
of you are fake?

23:17.659 --> 23:19.042
Hmm?

23:19.044 --> 23:23.379
Show me where the other
suicide vests are hidden, Yusuf.

23:23.381 --> 23:25.131
Point to the location.

23:29.953 --> 23:32.755
Do you know what they will do

23:32.757 --> 23:36.176
if they find out
that I helped you?

23:36.178 --> 23:38.845
They will kill my wife.

23:38.847 --> 23:41.581
They will kill my son.

23:41.583 --> 23:44.484
I would rather
you just kill me now.

23:59.950 --> 24:01.935
Carter, is that
the DOA's phone--

24:01.937 --> 24:03.169
Ronnie Middleton?

24:03.171 --> 24:05.838
His mother hasn't even come
to the morgue.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.373
This kid was all alone.

24:07.375 --> 24:09.209
He deserved better.

24:09.211 --> 24:12.212
So far, I've got nothing
on Hector.

24:12.214 --> 24:14.047
Analyst from
the real-time crime center

24:14.049 --> 24:15.998
sent over footage
from some of the cameras

24:16.000 --> 24:17.050
around Bodega La Nueva.

24:17.052 --> 24:18.017
Some?

24:18.019 --> 24:19.636
There's more cameras than this?

24:19.638 --> 24:21.337
Yeah. Mayor wants one
on every corner.

24:21.339 --> 24:23.389
Wow, no wonder I feel
like I'm always being watched.

24:23.391 --> 24:26.192
I figured Hector's GTO
had to pass

24:26.194 --> 24:28.478
through this intersection,
but nothing, <i>nada.</i>

24:28.480 --> 24:30.280
Maybe he didn't drive.
Maybe he walked.

24:30.282 --> 24:34.350
Castillo said he came
into his market a couple times

24:34.352 --> 24:37.036
to purchase
some booze and trojans.

24:37.038 --> 24:38.154
So?

24:38.156 --> 24:39.822
His girlfriend lives
in the Bronx too.

24:39.824 --> 24:43.192
Why would he have to go
25 blocks downtown for condoms?

24:43.194 --> 24:46.879
'Cause Don Juan got
a little chicky on the side.

24:46.881 --> 24:48.715
Hmm.

24:48.717 --> 24:50.667
Hector was on foot.

24:50.669 --> 24:53.670
Maybe he walked from
her apartment to the market.

24:53.672 --> 24:55.588
And that's where Hector
bumped into Ronnie.

24:55.590 --> 24:56.973
If we can find this <i>chica,</i>

24:56.975 --> 24:58.641
we might have ourselves
a new witness.

24:58.643 --> 25:00.093
I'm gonna make some phone calls.

25:00.095 --> 25:01.043
Look, I got to go.

25:01.045 --> 25:02.061
You can thank me later,
all right?

25:03.315 --> 25:05.064
Hello.
What, do you miss me already?

25:05.066 --> 25:06.733
You're a hard man
to miss, Lionel.

25:06.735 --> 25:08.851
I'd say this Carter
situation's got you worried.

25:08.853 --> 25:11.404
What are you gonna do,
follow her around from now on?

25:11.406 --> 25:13.439
I'm not.
You are.

25:13.441 --> 25:16.326
I've got some business
to take care of.

25:16.328 --> 25:18.411
Don't let her get
in any trouble.

25:18.413 --> 25:19.445
Carter's gunning for you.

25:19.447 --> 25:20.997
Hell, she's probably
gonna catch you.

25:20.999 --> 25:23.366
Why you spending so much time
trying to protect her?

25:23.368 --> 25:25.418
She's a good cop...

25:25.420 --> 25:27.537
Good person.

25:27.539 --> 25:29.839
Hell, you should
try it sometime, Lionel.

25:29.841 --> 25:31.407
Yeah, thanks,
look, I'm just saying,

25:31.409 --> 25:33.126
if she wasn't around,
it would probably solve

25:33.128 --> 25:34.994
a lot of your problems,
now, wouldn't it?

25:34.996 --> 25:36.912
If anything happens
to her, Lionel,

25:36.914 --> 25:38.598
I'm coming for you next.

25:47.374 --> 25:48.691
What the--

26:00.871 --> 26:03.206
Knock, knock.

26:03.208 --> 26:04.657
What do we have here?

26:04.659 --> 26:08.378
Hector's a busy man--
Fixing cars and running guns.

26:08.380 --> 26:11.414
Who are you, man?

26:11.416 --> 26:14.300
Tell Hector I'm the guy that
just put him out of business.

26:17.671 --> 26:20.973
If I see him again, I'll close
down more than the shop.

26:41.312 --> 26:42.828
If you help us,

26:42.830 --> 26:46.165
I can protect you
and your family.

26:46.167 --> 26:49.068
I promise.

26:49.070 --> 26:52.521
This is just
a negotiation for you.

26:52.523 --> 26:55.574
You don't care
about me or my family.

26:55.576 --> 27:00.279
Your son--
He's named after you.

27:00.281 --> 27:02.114
He's turning 8
in 14 days, right?

27:02.116 --> 27:05.167
Favorite sport?
Soccer.

27:05.169 --> 27:08.004
But it's too dangerous
to play in the field by you.

27:08.006 --> 27:10.256
Your only brother, Naji,

27:10.258 --> 27:13.643
was killed nine months ago
by an IED.

27:13.645 --> 27:18.014
You visit his grave every day.

27:18.016 --> 27:21.684
So, you see...

27:21.686 --> 27:25.905
You are not
just a negotiation...

27:25.907 --> 27:28.074
Not to me.

27:30.977 --> 27:32.578
Do you have children?

27:32.580 --> 27:35.197
A son.
Taylor.

27:35.199 --> 27:37.983
Would you trust his life
to a complete stranger?

27:37.985 --> 27:41.620
I'd do whatever was
in my power to protect him.

27:41.622 --> 27:44.957
You lost your brother, Yusuf.

27:46.878 --> 27:50.880
I lost someone
very close to me too.

27:50.882 --> 27:54.383
It changed everything.

27:54.385 --> 27:55.634
You and me...

27:55.636 --> 27:57.720
We're not that different.

27:57.722 --> 27:58.804
No.

27:58.806 --> 28:01.006
We want the same thing.

28:01.008 --> 28:03.675
For our children
to walk down the street

28:03.677 --> 28:07.947
and not be afraid.

28:07.949 --> 28:12.851
Show me where
those explosives are.

28:18.358 --> 28:20.876
The location is not on the map.

28:20.878 --> 28:23.913
Then you'll take us to them.

28:23.915 --> 28:26.215
For our children.

28:29.419 --> 28:32.254
For our children.

28:41.732 --> 28:44.049
Hey, BC.

28:44.051 --> 28:46.569
You got anything
on Hector's new woman?

28:46.571 --> 28:49.388
Relax.
Fusco's all right.

28:49.390 --> 28:51.490
Easy there, hubcap.
I don't bite.

28:51.492 --> 28:55.227
All right,
let's make this quick.

28:55.229 --> 28:58.080
I seen Hector's GTO
outside the lookie-loo.

28:58.082 --> 29:02.034
Turns out he's bumping
one of the dancers-- Mei Li.

29:02.036 --> 29:04.870
If you ask ask me, Hector got
a little tired of his <i>chica</i>

29:04.872 --> 29:07.072
and wanted some strange.

29:07.074 --> 29:09.759
You done good.

29:09.761 --> 29:13.379
Uh, I thought you said...

29:13.381 --> 29:15.080
You know, real money...

29:15.082 --> 29:16.298
Reward money.

29:16.300 --> 29:17.600
Okay.

29:17.602 --> 29:20.636
Well, if this pans out, I will
get you that reward money.

29:20.638 --> 29:22.421
I'll meet you later,

29:22.423 --> 29:24.607
even take you to dinner
at your favorite spot.

29:24.609 --> 29:26.525
All right.

29:26.527 --> 29:28.694
Yeah, but only 'cause it's you.

29:28.696 --> 29:30.563
You always been
good to me, Carter.

29:30.565 --> 29:32.448
Okay.
Take care.

29:34.451 --> 29:36.986
Yes, me and Hector
was together all night.

29:36.988 --> 29:39.405
We watched tv,
and then we went to bed.

29:39.407 --> 29:41.073
- What'd you watch?
- I don't know.

29:41.075 --> 29:42.958
Hector's always changing
the channels.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.827
I heard that about that guy.

29:44.829 --> 29:47.546
He gets bored, he likes
to switch it up, huh?

29:47.548 --> 29:51.000
Is that why he has
that other girl on the side?

29:51.002 --> 29:53.252
No, no, no.

29:53.254 --> 29:55.421
You see, my man
don't step out on me.

29:55.423 --> 29:56.639
I'll cut it off.

29:56.641 --> 29:57.723
Ooh, okay.

29:57.725 --> 30:01.560
Come here.
I want you to see something.

30:01.562 --> 30:05.431
That's Hector's
cell phone bill.

30:05.433 --> 30:06.732
You know whose number that is?

30:06.734 --> 30:08.734
'Cause he dialed it 33 times.

30:08.736 --> 30:10.236
I don't know,
it's probably one of his homies.

30:10.238 --> 30:12.021
That man gossips
like a little schoolgirl.

30:12.023 --> 30:13.989
Well, it's easy enough
to find out.

30:13.991 --> 30:15.407
Go ahead.
Dial it.

30:15.409 --> 30:16.942
So you were
with Hector all night.

30:16.944 --> 30:19.645
Last night, this morning.

30:19.647 --> 30:21.497
Hector's a morning person.

30:21.499 --> 30:24.149
He likes to spoon.

30:24.151 --> 30:25.918
Hello?

30:27.587 --> 30:29.171
Hello?

30:29.173 --> 30:30.489
Who is this?

30:30.491 --> 30:33.992
Wait.
Who the hell are you?

30:33.994 --> 30:35.661
Okay, all right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:35.663 --> 30:37.847
Looks like you two
got a lot to sort out.

30:37.849 --> 30:40.432
Uh, make sure
they don't kill each other.

30:40.434 --> 30:41.667
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

30:41.669 --> 30:43.869
- You got to be kidding me!
- Aah! Aah!

30:45.640 --> 30:47.640
Carter, looks like
you're not the only one

30:47.642 --> 30:49.007
who's got a beef
with Hector Alvarez.

30:49.009 --> 30:52.194
Some guy came into his body shop
and shot up the place.

30:52.196 --> 30:54.230
Bangers inside got a taste
of their own medicines.

30:54.232 --> 30:56.148
Said the guy had
a submachine gun

30:56.150 --> 30:58.617
and a grenade launcher.

30:58.619 --> 31:00.519
You believe that?

31:00.521 --> 31:02.288
This guy wearing a suit?

31:02.290 --> 31:04.039
No, motorcycle jacket.
Why?

31:04.041 --> 31:06.242
Maybe it's in the cleaners.

31:06.244 --> 31:07.710
Hector's wanted
for questioning.

31:07.712 --> 31:09.879
Suffice it to say,
he's, uh, disappeared.

31:11.031 --> 31:12.998
Somebody knows where he is.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.702
If I find Hector,
I'll give him your best.

31:16.704 --> 31:19.338
Hector's on the run.

31:19.340 --> 31:21.090
He's not gonna be a problem
for Carter anymore.

31:21.092 --> 31:22.374
I'm not so sure about that.

31:22.376 --> 31:24.677
Carter is now determined
to get justice for Ronnie.

31:24.679 --> 31:26.896
One way or another, she will
find where Hector's hiding.

31:26.898 --> 31:29.932
The guy's running guns.

31:29.934 --> 31:32.268
Wherever he is,
he's heavily armed.

31:32.270 --> 31:33.736
And when she goes
to arrest him--

31:33.738 --> 31:36.155
- I'll just have
to get there first.

31:36.157 --> 31:39.692
Is everything okay,
Mr. Reese?

31:42.579 --> 31:45.381
We got into this
to stop bad things

31:45.383 --> 31:48.400
from happening to good people.

31:48.402 --> 31:51.704
Carter's been doing that
her whole life.

31:51.706 --> 31:55.140
She's not just
another number, Finch.

31:56.543 --> 32:00.212
Some people the world
can't afford to lose.

32:00.214 --> 32:02.264
Either one of you
ready to make a statement?

32:02.266 --> 32:04.433
Yeah, I got a statement.

32:04.435 --> 32:06.185
Hector Alvarez is a damn fool

32:06.187 --> 32:09.104
if he thinks
he can play us both.

32:09.106 --> 32:11.390
Bastard came to my place,
but he went out around midnight.

32:11.392 --> 32:13.859
- Did he go to the market?
- What he said.

32:13.861 --> 32:16.928
But he came back empty-handed
and changed his shirt.

32:16.930 --> 32:19.114
You wash this shirt of his?

32:19.116 --> 32:20.399
Oh, hell, no.

32:20.401 --> 32:24.119
It's all yours
along with all his stuff.

32:24.121 --> 32:27.373
So where is Hector?

32:27.375 --> 32:31.043
He has a warehouse in Queens...

32:31.045 --> 32:32.628
On 25th.

32:32.630 --> 32:35.798
He hangs out there sometimes
when he's expecting a shipment.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.751
Call ESU, get a ten standby.

32:38.753 --> 32:40.285
I'm gonna see
about getting a warrant.

32:40.287 --> 32:42.254
Hello?

32:42.256 --> 32:43.389
He's got a gun!

32:43.391 --> 32:44.673
Uh, wait a minute.
Calm down.

32:44.675 --> 32:46.158
- I can't understand you.
- He's got a gun!

32:46.160 --> 32:48.260
- Get out of there!
- Oh, God! Please!

32:48.262 --> 32:49.961
He's gonna kill me!
Hurry!

32:49.963 --> 32:51.630
Mrs. Kovach, where are you?

32:51.632 --> 32:53.632
- In the bathroom!
- Stay where you are.

32:53.634 --> 32:55.267
I'm gonna come and get you.

32:55.269 --> 32:57.353
Hello? Hello?

32:57.355 --> 32:59.971
Carter's going
to the Kovachs' house.

32:59.973 --> 33:04.109
He's armed,
sounds extremely agitated.

33:04.111 --> 33:06.779
Reese?

33:06.781 --> 33:08.113
Where are you?

33:08.115 --> 33:09.581
All units, we have a code ten.

33:09.583 --> 33:12.484
Shots fired at 326 Greentree
in Flushing.

33:12.486 --> 33:14.536
NYPD, open up!

33:15.988 --> 33:17.506
Sure we shouldn't wait
for backup?

33:17.508 --> 33:19.157
- I got a bad feeling about this.
- Mr. Kovach...

33:19.159 --> 33:22.160
It's the police.
Put down your weapon.

33:26.666 --> 33:30.352
What the hell?

33:33.139 --> 33:34.840
Somebody gift-wrapped him
for us.

33:34.842 --> 33:38.009
Somebody's been doing that
a lot lately.

33:38.011 --> 33:40.195
Mrs. Kovach?

33:40.197 --> 33:42.114
Mrs. Kovach?

33:47.538 --> 33:49.288
Mrs. Kovach,
are you okay?

33:49.290 --> 33:52.741
He was gonna kill me.
If that man hadn't shown up--

33:52.743 --> 33:55.044
- "That man"?
What'd he look like?

33:55.046 --> 33:58.163
Hello?

34:01.584 --> 34:04.303
It's for you.

34:08.007 --> 34:10.141
I guess I have you
to thank for this.

34:10.143 --> 34:11.726
How do you always know

34:11.728 --> 34:12.811
when something bad's
about to go down?

34:12.813 --> 34:15.013
You're in trouble, detective.

34:15.014 --> 34:18.382
I'm not the one who's hiding.

34:18.385 --> 34:21.018
Look, you keep playing God,
and sooner or later,

34:21.021 --> 34:22.888
an innocent person's
gonna get hurt.

34:22.889 --> 34:23.989
I can't let that happen.

34:23.991 --> 34:26.074
Listen, I didn't call
to talk about me.

34:26.077 --> 34:27.326
Your life's in danger.

34:27.328 --> 34:30.579
I'm a cop.
My life's always in danger.

34:30.581 --> 34:32.081
You're not listening to me.

34:32.083 --> 34:35.000
I'm trying to tell you
someone wants you dead.

34:36.786 --> 34:39.237
Who told you that?

34:39.239 --> 34:42.091
Why are you following me?
What do you want?

34:42.092 --> 34:44.176
I want you to start
being more careful.

34:44.178 --> 34:47.179
For instance, if you're gonna
take down Hector Alvarez,

34:47.181 --> 34:49.181
you should know
the man's running guns.

34:49.183 --> 34:51.600
He has an arsenal
at his fingertips.

34:51.601 --> 34:54.585
What-- Why are you
helping me?

34:54.588 --> 34:57.422
And how do you keep finding out
all of this information?

34:57.424 --> 34:58.757
Like you said...

34:58.759 --> 35:01.426
I always seem to know.

35:20.964 --> 35:22.548
I never saw his face.

35:22.550 --> 35:24.166
He came out of nowhere.

35:24.168 --> 35:27.336
He attacked me.
You people can't arrest me.

35:27.338 --> 35:28.337
Yes, we can.

35:28.339 --> 35:31.757
Your wife is pressing charges,
Eddie.

35:31.759 --> 35:33.625
We get a warrant
on Hector Alvarez yet?

35:33.627 --> 35:37.813
Yep, ESU's standing by.
Who died?

35:59.008 --> 36:01.710
Finch, Carter's
called an ESU unit

36:01.712 --> 36:03.879
to Hector's warehouse
in queens.

36:03.881 --> 36:06.849
They're getting ready to knock
on the door as we speak.

36:11.054 --> 36:12.955
It's time to roll.
Stay here.

36:12.957 --> 36:15.641
I'll advise you when we have
Alvarez apprehended.

36:15.643 --> 36:17.359
You have eyes on Carter?

36:17.361 --> 36:19.144
She's clear
of the line of fire.

36:19.146 --> 36:21.480
If Hector puts up a fight,
it could be dangerous.

36:21.482 --> 36:23.782
How will you be close enough
to protect her?

36:23.784 --> 36:24.783
Oh, I'm...

36:24.785 --> 36:26.068
Pretty close.

36:26.070 --> 36:27.653
They got this place
covered, right?

36:27.655 --> 36:28.704
Absolutely.

36:28.706 --> 36:30.372
Cover's going in.

36:30.374 --> 36:31.874
- Everybody set?
- Yes, sir.

36:31.876 --> 36:33.959
Open it.

36:33.961 --> 36:35.544
Do it.

36:35.546 --> 36:37.546
Move! Move! Move!
NYPD!

36:37.548 --> 36:40.782
Down on the ground now!

36:40.784 --> 36:43.502
That doesn't sound good.

36:46.557 --> 36:50.175
You hear something around back?

37:09.579 --> 37:11.780
Get out of the car.

37:11.782 --> 37:13.699
Suspect apprehended.

37:13.701 --> 37:15.317
Take it easy.

37:15.319 --> 37:17.169
Everything all right,
Mr. Reese?

37:17.171 --> 37:18.820
Hector's got
a new set of bracelets.

37:18.822 --> 37:21.673
Should keep him busy
for a while.

37:21.675 --> 37:23.509
That's for Ronnie.

37:23.511 --> 37:27.162
- I told you I'd get you.
- Oh, God.

37:28.664 --> 37:31.049
Hey, Taylor, baby.
I'm running a little late.

37:31.051 --> 37:34.686
I'll be there soon.

37:34.688 --> 37:37.389
Sounds like Carter's
headed home.

37:37.391 --> 37:39.174
Made it through the day.

37:39.176 --> 37:41.109
Have we eliminated
the threat yet?

37:41.111 --> 37:45.647
Kovach and Alvarez
are neutralized.

37:45.649 --> 37:47.533
But this is a tricky case.

37:47.535 --> 37:50.819
To be perfectly honest,
I'm just...

37:50.821 --> 37:51.954
Not sure.

37:51.956 --> 37:53.822
Finch, Carter lives uptown.

37:53.824 --> 37:55.991
So why is she headed downtown?

37:55.993 --> 37:57.376
Wait a minute.

37:57.378 --> 37:59.628
Where'd she go?

38:01.781 --> 38:03.582
I lost her.

38:03.584 --> 38:06.802
Track her phone for me.

38:11.140 --> 38:12.140
Where you been?

38:12.142 --> 38:13.675
You said you was gonna
buy me dinner.

38:13.677 --> 38:15.344
Where you been?
I been waiting.

38:15.346 --> 38:17.545
I'm sorry, BC.
I got to fill out a requisition

38:17.547 --> 38:20.465
for the big payout.

38:20.467 --> 38:23.151
But look, why don't you take
whatever I got?

38:23.153 --> 38:24.736
No, that's all right.
You ain't got to do all that.

38:24.738 --> 38:26.738
Let's just call this
a down payment, okay?

38:26.740 --> 38:29.691
I want you to have that.

38:29.693 --> 38:31.243
I'm sorry, Carter.

38:31.245 --> 38:32.911
You always been good to me,

38:32.913 --> 38:36.698
but I ain't got no choice.

38:36.700 --> 38:41.286
You told me to find
that guy Elias.

38:41.288 --> 38:42.871
Well, I found him.

38:45.675 --> 38:48.343
Sorry.

38:48.345 --> 38:50.912
He said it's either
gonna be you or me.

38:50.914 --> 38:53.682
And it ain't gonna be me.

39:10.149 --> 39:11.867
Look alive, Carter.

39:13.736 --> 39:15.370
About all that's left
of that storage facility

39:15.372 --> 39:16.738
your friend took us to.

39:16.740 --> 39:18.957
You found the explosives.

39:18.959 --> 39:20.442
Found and detonated.

39:20.444 --> 39:23.879
I, uh, couldn't have done
what you did,

39:23.881 --> 39:27.716
getting information
from that raghead.

39:27.718 --> 39:30.952
Where's Yusuf?

39:30.954 --> 39:35.340
Yeah, he, uh...
Didn't make it back.

39:35.342 --> 39:39.127
Accidents happen.

39:39.129 --> 39:42.130
He trusted me.

39:42.132 --> 39:46.184
I gave him my word.
I-I promised I'd protect him.

39:46.186 --> 39:49.154
You shouldn't make promises
you can't keep.

39:49.156 --> 39:51.523
Come on, you don't think
this guy was innocent, do you?

39:51.525 --> 39:54.142
He had a family.

39:54.144 --> 39:56.478
Don't you care
what happens to them?

39:56.480 --> 39:59.031
It's not my job to care.

39:59.033 --> 40:01.667
What is wrong with you?

40:01.669 --> 40:03.869
You can't just play God!

40:03.871 --> 40:07.122
You don't get to decide
who lives and who dies!

40:07.124 --> 40:11.093
You want to stand
on your high horse, go ahead.

40:11.095 --> 40:13.762
But don't expect me and my men
to back you up.

40:13.764 --> 40:15.547
It's a long war.

40:15.549 --> 40:18.433
And you're all alone.

40:26.726 --> 40:28.110
Glad you took my advice

40:28.112 --> 40:30.979
about wearing that vest,
detective.

40:30.981 --> 40:33.014
I know this
doesn't change anything.

40:33.016 --> 40:35.367
I know you'll still arrest me
if you get the chance.

40:35.369 --> 40:37.685
But you should know,

40:37.687 --> 40:40.355
whether you like me
or not, Joss,

40:40.357 --> 40:43.458
you're not alone.

40:54.637 --> 40:57.305
Elias got to Carter's CI.

40:57.307 --> 40:58.390
Turned him into his triggerman.

40:58.392 --> 41:00.726
- Is she safe?
- For now.

41:00.728 --> 41:03.979
Time to end this, Finch,
once and for all.

41:07.316 --> 41:10.068
Aah!

41:10.070 --> 41:12.404
Body falls from this height,
it's messy.

41:12.406 --> 41:15.723
Of course, I don't care
about making it look clean...

41:15.725 --> 41:16.992
Unlike your pal Elias.

41:16.994 --> 41:18.744
I don't know who you are,

41:18.746 --> 41:21.229
but you're threatening
a captain.

41:21.231 --> 41:23.231
Okay, okay, okay.

41:23.233 --> 41:26.568
Elias can't kill a cop
without permission.

41:26.570 --> 41:29.171
Run this up
the chain of command.

41:29.173 --> 41:30.905
Permission's been revoked.

41:30.907 --> 41:35.743
Tell Elias if he so much as
touches Detective Carter again,

41:35.745 --> 41:39.431
I will put him, you...

41:39.433 --> 41:41.850
Everyone in the ground.

41:41.852 --> 41:44.386
- You got that?
- Yeah.

41:44.388 --> 41:48.590
Oh. Oh.

41:58.868 --> 42:02.704
Grandma said you were late
for curfew again.

42:02.706 --> 42:05.657
Oh, come on, ma.
You're serious?

42:05.659 --> 42:07.159
I was at a dance.

42:07.161 --> 42:10.212
Is she pretty?

42:12.048 --> 42:14.382
Better be smart too.

42:14.384 --> 42:16.718
Smart and pretty.

42:22.725 --> 42:24.092
You all right, mom?

42:24.094 --> 42:27.145
Did you pull your back
or something?

42:27.147 --> 42:30.265
It's nothing that won't heal.

42:34.187 --> 42:37.105
Sorry I missed it, t.

42:37.107 --> 42:40.859
You work too hard.
You should quit.

42:40.861 --> 42:43.495
Wouldn't know
how to if I tried.

42:43.497 --> 42:46.998
I don't like it--
You out there every day.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.583
Who's got your back?

42:50.920 --> 42:53.655
You don't have to worry
about me.

42:53.657 --> 42:56.675
I can take care of myself.

42:56.677 --> 42:58.993
Besides...

42:58.995 --> 43:01.847
We got each other.

43:01.849 --> 43:04.099
Who else do we need?
