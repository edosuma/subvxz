— [Siren Chirping]
_ [Pol/be Rad/'0 Chatter]

00:05.965 --> 00:07.626
[ Booth ]
Okay. This is revolting.

00:07.758 --> 00:10.090
[ Hodgins ]
Yeah. The garbage barge ended up
capsizing during the hurricane.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.339
It all ended up
washing onto the coast.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.591
Well, even without
the garbage spill,

00:14.682 --> 00:18.425
coastal waters can have
over 240,000 parts per million
of fecal coliform.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.306
Fecal coliforms?
Is that what I think it is?

00:21.397 --> 00:22.933
- Oh, yeah.
— Not to mention,

00:23.024 --> 00:25.015
chemical contaminants from
illegal dumping, as well—

00:25.109 --> 00:27.521
Right, right, right.
Got it. Okay?
lt’s disgusting.

00:27.612 --> 00:31.275
[ Hodgins ]
Whoa—ho—ho. Is that thing
why they called us?

00:31.407 --> 00:33.648
[ Booth ]
What the hell is that?
[Hodgins ] We don’t know.

00:33.743 --> 00:36.610
It’s a... container of some sort.

00:38.831 --> 00:41.618
Whoa. Filled with...

00:41.709 --> 00:44.542
gelatinized human remains.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.752
At first,
I thought pod people.
[ Booth ] Of course you did.

00:46.881 --> 00:51.341
Hey, there are still a lot of
questions remaining about
the events at Area 51, you know.

00:51.427 --> 00:52.883
Do you know
that U.F.O. spottings—

00:52.970 --> 00:55.302
Let’s just keep it close to
Earth here, bug boy, okay?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.425
Just simplify the investigation.

00:57.516 --> 01:01.304
Reminds me of a ship in a bottle.
My dad gave me one when l was little.

01:01.395 --> 01:05.638
Right. So this, uh, kind of
brings up all these warm
and cuddly memories for you.

01:05.733 --> 01:06.893
That’s nice.

01:06.984 --> 01:10.226
I can’t make out enough detail
to determine gender.

01:10.321 --> 01:14.109
[Hodgins] l have no idea what
this is made from, or how he got
inside. There are no openings.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.283
- [ Beeping ]
— Based on angular eye orbits...

01:17.370 --> 01:19.907
and a large mastoid process,

01:19.997 --> 01:21.828
the decedent is male.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.372
Human?

01:23.459 --> 01:25.825
- Really?
— I’m just being thorough.

01:28.464 --> 01:30.500
[ Beeping ]

01:32.802 --> 01:35.635
[ Arastoo ]
l have a record
of my hours right here.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.586
You keep very
complete records, Mr. Vaziri.

01:37.682 --> 01:40.640
It’s not as if
I make a lot of money,
so every little bit helps.

01:40.726 --> 01:43.388
Well, I’ll check my records
and call Payroll.

01:43.479 --> 01:45.265
As soon as you can,
I’d appreciate it.

01:45.356 --> 01:47.597
According to my calculations,
l’m owed over $200,

01:47.692 --> 01:49.683
and l have a special
dinner planned, so—

01:49.777 --> 01:53.144
Well, a $200 dinner
must be very special.

01:53.239 --> 01:54.729
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah. I hope so.

01:54.824 --> 01:57.031
Well, I’ll just need you
to sign these forms.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.700
Hey, Cam, I got another text
from your doctor boyfriend.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.288
Oh, God. I’m sorry.

02:01.372 --> 02:02.828
And he’s not my boyfriend.

02:02.915 --> 02:06.624
Well, sounds like he thinks he is.
He wants me to tell you to call.

02:06.711 --> 02:09.794
I told him it was over.
I can’t date my daughter’s gynecologist.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.462
Every time we go out,
I can’t help thinking—

02:12.550 --> 02:14.381
It’s okay. It’s okay.
l—l get it.

02:14.468 --> 02:18.677
— Yeah. We all do.
— I told him that it was over,
that I’m seeing someone else.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.967
Uh, is there anything more
I need to sign?
No.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.764
That is good. Thanks.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.093
I will call him again,

02:26.188 --> 02:28.019
and he will not
bother you anymore.

02:28.107 --> 02:30.223
I guarantee it.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.900
You, uh— You didn’t tell me
you were seeing someone.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.477
Oh, I am.

02:34.572 --> 02:37.234
| just don’t like to bring
my personal life into work.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.941
Oh—ho—ho.
So you still haven’t
slept together?

02:40.036 --> 02:41.867
That would be talking about it.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.411
— Come on, Cam.
I’m not gonna tell anybody.
— Working.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.658
You’re no fun.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.536
That’s not what he says.

02:50.838 --> 02:54.672
Uh— Uh, nice.

02:54.759 --> 02:55.748
[ Exhales ]

02:58.637 --> 03:01.253
Brennan says that
he’s a male Caucasian.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.510
Age is impossible
to determine as of yet.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.592
Of course.
This is amazing.

03:05.728 --> 03:07.514
Yeah.
I thought pod people
were science fiction.

03:07.605 --> 03:10.267
Oh, “there are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio.”

03:10.358 --> 03:13.691
Once we get him out of there,
I’ll need to separate the bones
from the decomposing tissue.

03:13.778 --> 03:15.518
How are you planning
on getting him out of there?

03:15.613 --> 03:18.821
He seems to have been
sealed in somehow,
but I don’t see a seam.

03:18.908 --> 03:21.490
These two farmers
from South Dakota, right?

03:21.577 --> 03:24.410
They claimed to be abducted,
encased in this—

03:24.497 --> 03:26.704
in this solid,
glowing container,

03:26.791 --> 03:29.032
and then deposited
into this landfill.

03:29.168 --> 03:32.035
The Hadley brothers.
Yes, 1963.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.630
Very good, Arastoo.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.251
They had a blood—alcohol level
four times the legal limit.

03:36.342 --> 03:38.674
I’d like to believe that
the aliens were wonderful hosts.

03:38.761 --> 03:40.547
- Are you gonna
help me with this?
— Why me?

03:40.638 --> 03:44.222
Weird stuff is your area.
Bones are my area.
This is weird stuff.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.673
Absolutely.

03:45.768 --> 03:50.478
Man, this seems to be some kind
of multilayered organic polymer.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.146
You know you’re gonna
use the laser.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.475
You don’t have to
justify it to me.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.825
Ready?
Yeah.

04:07.123 --> 04:08.613
Here we go.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.325
[ Crackling ]

04:19.510 --> 04:20.670
Okay.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.210
Whoa.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.681
Wow.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.471
That was really easy.
You know why?

04:26.559 --> 04:28.424
— Laser.
— Yeah, exactly.

04:28.519 --> 04:32.011
Because a good workman
chooses the correct tool
for the job.

04:32.106 --> 04:35.974
So what now? Do we just tip it
over and let it drain into
a tub, or insert a tube or—

04:36.068 --> 04:39.652
Safety first.
Wanna make sure
everything’s safe in there.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.444
[ Sniffs ]
Oh.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.614
l have never smelled
anything like that before.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.488
I mean, I suppose
that that could be, um—

04:46.579 --> 04:48.365
[Thuds]

04:49.874 --> 04:53.913
[Alarm Blaring ]

04:54.003 --> 04:55.834
Hodgins. Hodgins!

05:27.912 --> 05:30.244
[ Saroyan ]
His eyes are opening.
[Hodgins Moans]

05:30.331 --> 05:32.071
[Arastoo, Distant]
Hodgins,
can you hear me?

05:32.166 --> 05:34.157
[ Brennan ]
He’s breathing.
If you take care of Hodgins,

05:34.251 --> 05:37.209
there’s no reason for me
not to look at the remains.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.037
Okay. How many fingers
am | holding up?

05:40.174 --> 05:42.165
Three?
[ Arastoo ]
He spoke. That’s a good sign.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.630
N—No, don’t—
don’t get up.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.177
[ Groans ]
How long was I out?

05:47.264 --> 05:49.300
[ Arastoo ]
Fifty—two seconds.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.970
You timed me?
It’s important to know
how long...

05:52.061 --> 05:54.677
a person is unconscious—
under a minute
counts as fainting...

05:54.772 --> 05:56.683
and doesn’t necessarily
require hospitalization.

05:56.774 --> 05:58.890
— You hit the ground hard.
— Does anything hurt?

05:58.984 --> 06:01.191
Only my pride.
What got me?

06:01.278 --> 06:03.860
The remains were trapped
in a primarily anaerobic environment,

06:03.948 --> 06:05.859
which caused the flesh to ferment.

06:05.950 --> 06:09.192
— Carbon dioxide.
— Oh, man. Totally rookie move.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.028
Anyone else feeling
the effects?

06:12.122 --> 06:15.535
Just me?
Okay. No, I’m fine, honestly.

06:15.626 --> 06:19.369
Just go, and l’ll— I’ll just—
I’ll be good as new in a minute.

06:19.463 --> 06:22.205
Blunt—force trauma
to the posterior plane...

06:22.299 --> 06:25.086
of the occipital
with rough—edged abrasions.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.884
- Likely cause of death.
- The decedent’s
upper and lower...

06:27.972 --> 06:30.588
central and lateral incisors
are missing.

06:30.683 --> 06:32.969
— Yet the root’s intact.
— Somebody smashed out
his teeth.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.346
Oh. Dr. Hodgins,
there appear to be...

06:35.437 --> 06:38.804
a number of different substances
suspended in the matrix.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.060
[Hodgins]
I’m good.
Totally fine.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.277
[Sighs]

06:42.361 --> 06:44.727
Do not fall into
the evidence,
Dr. Hodgins.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.608
It will only add
to your humiliation.

06:46.699 --> 06:49.190
She didn’t mean “add,”
because there’s no humiliation.

06:49.285 --> 06:52.903
[Hodgins Groans]
Uh, I’m gonna filter out
that big stuff and identify it,

06:52.997 --> 06:56.205
but it looks to me
like it’s wood splinters.

06:56.292 --> 06:59.534
What happened?
Are you— Are you okay?

06:59.628 --> 07:03.246
Uh, Dr. Hodgins foolishly
inhaled noxious gases
emanating from the remains,

07:03.340 --> 07:05.171
and... he fainted.

07:05.301 --> 07:08.759
- Not inhaled— sniffed.
— Now, come on.
Your kindness is looking like pity.

07:08.846 --> 07:12.430
Um, Booth wants me to do a
facial reconstruction A.S.A.P.,

07:12.516 --> 07:14.723
so I’m gonna need
to take a look at the skull.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.926
Oh, my God.

07:17.021 --> 07:19.763
— Looks like I’ll be
skipping lunch again.
- Whoa.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.347
Hodgins?

07:23.027 --> 07:24.767
You know, smashing out
the teeth suggests...

07:24.862 --> 07:26.727
that the murderer was trying
to make it difficult...

07:26.822 --> 07:28.278
to identify the victim.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.980
[ Booth ] Psychologically,
or in the real world?

07:30.075 --> 07:32.031
Was that a shot?
That sounded like a shot.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.280
Please don’t discuss the case
in front of Christine.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.282
Listen, uh, Christine is asleep.

07:36.373 --> 07:39.786
You can, uh— You can read
something a little bit more
mature than Hooligan Bear.

07:39.877 --> 07:43.461
Well, I... find I can’t relax
until Little Louie is safe.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.048
[ Sweets ]
Maybe it’s mob—related.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.588
If they didn’t
want the body
idenﬂﬁed,

07:46.675 --> 07:48.131
then why did they
leave the hands?

07:48.218 --> 07:50.504
— You’re still
discussing the case.
- Right. You see, we—

07:50.596 --> 07:53.212
— We try not to talk
about work at home.
— Or home at work.

07:53.307 --> 07:56.390
See, we believe a line between
work and life is important.

07:56.477 --> 07:59.514
I’m sorry. I have a hard time believing
Dr. Brennan can talk about anything else.

07:59.605 --> 08:00.890
She’s got lots of interests.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.599
Yes, I am currently considering
writing a children’s book.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.275
Oh, how are you gonna fit
a murder into that?

08:09.281 --> 08:11.317
That was a joke.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.114
Oh—
[ Laughing ]

08:13.202 --> 08:15.864
| get it.
It’s funny because...

08:15.954 --> 08:19.162
a murder would be
inappropriate for a toddler.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.831
[ Laughing Continues]

08:21.919 --> 08:23.409
You got it.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.795
— Why does your office
smell like Thanksgiving?
— l’m testing my pod theory.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.343
By roasting turkeys?

08:33.430 --> 08:35.386
In a manner
of speaking, yeah.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.260
The pod containing
our victim’s remains...

08:37.351 --> 08:38.807
showed the same
chemical properties...

08:38.894 --> 08:40.680
as normal types
of plastic sheeting,

08:40.771 --> 08:41.726
only harder.

08:41.814 --> 08:44.226
See, after the victim
was murdered, right,

08:44.316 --> 08:46.022
the killer wrapped
the body in plastic,

08:46.110 --> 08:49.227
then dumped it onto
the trash barge where it was
exposed to direct sunlight.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.233
The gases from the decomposing
body caused the plastic to expand.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.531
Yeah, the heat,
coupled with the
bacteria and lipids,

08:54.618 --> 08:57.155
combined to create a catalyst
which hardened the plastic.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.532
And we may actually be able
to figure out how long...

08:59.623 --> 09:01.864
our victim was stewing
in that pod before
we found him.

09:01.959 --> 09:05.417
You solved the “body in the pod” mystery.
[ Chuckles ]

09:05.504 --> 09:07.711
I’m not gonna ask why
it smells like turkey in here...

09:07.798 --> 09:10.380
because I’d like to
enjoy Thanksgiving...
for the rest of my life.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.174
— What we’re doing—
— No, I’m really not
gonna ask, Dr. Hodgins.

09:13.262 --> 09:16.504
- Okay.
— l merely came in to thank
Mr. Vaziri for his book.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.340
- What is that?
— Uh, something I wrote.

09:19.435 --> 09:22.893
I’m sorry. Is this something
you didn’t want people to know?

09:22.980 --> 09:25.767
— You’re a writer?
— It’s just poetry.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.940
It’s, like, a hobby.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.187
Based on the auricular surfaces
of the ilia,

09:30.279 --> 09:32.770
l determined that the victim
was in his early to mid-40s.

09:32.865 --> 09:34.730
I will put that
in the evidence binder.

09:34.825 --> 09:38.443
Apparently, Mr. Vaziri
is modest when it comes to
his literary achievements.

09:38.537 --> 09:43.156
Oh, man. My main experience
with writers is Dr. Brennan,
and she is not modest.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.453
What is this?
Yes, Dr. Hodgins.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.034
This is far more
interesting.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.541
Uh, it’s the wood splinters
found with the body.

09:49.631 --> 09:53.169
Uh, there’s a discoloration
on many of them
that turns out to be ink.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.876
- They were stamped?
- Yeah, perhaps by
the manufacturer.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.508
Hey, if you’re so modest,

09:58.599 --> 10:01.932
why did you give Cam
your poetry?

10:02.019 --> 10:05.136
Because I gave Mr. Vaziri time off
to meet with his publisher.

10:08.358 --> 10:11.020
Maybe Angela can
reconstruct that stamp.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.563
Yes, that’s our stamp—
Lumber For Less.

10:16.658 --> 10:20.571
- What’s this about?
— Uh, we are, uh,
trying to identify this man.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.076
This could be Lucky.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.623
Why? What’s going on?

10:26.710 --> 10:28.416
We are identifying
human remains.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.579
Oh, my God. Lucky’s dead?

10:31.673 --> 10:33.413
Does Lucky have a name?

10:33.509 --> 10:36.672
Yes. It’s, uh, Charles Milner.
He’s a regular customer.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.468
What happened to him?

10:38.597 --> 10:40.508
Was he a contractor or—
Sort of.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.682
— Sort of?
- He was one of those
crime scene cleanup guys.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.555
You know,
after a messy murder?

10:45.646 --> 10:47.557
We know quite a lot
about that subject.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.264
— Yes, we do.
— But you’re not positive
it’s Lucky, right?

10:50.359 --> 10:51.815
It could be somebody else.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.483
The police
are wrong about that—

10:53.570 --> 10:56.607
[Crying ]
kind of thing
all the time, right?

10:58.992 --> 11:01.153
Uh, is there something
you need to tell us?

11:01.245 --> 11:03.031
[Crying Continues]

11:03.121 --> 11:06.329
You should know that if
the victim is identified
as Charles Milner...

11:06.416 --> 11:08.407
and his death is
ruled a homicide,

11:08.502 --> 11:10.993
we will uncover everything
about his life.

11:11.088 --> 11:14.421
Everything. That includes
secrets between two people.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.794
[ Sniffles ]
Yes.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.217
Yes, you have something
to tell us?

11:19.805 --> 11:21.511
You’re right. Um,

11:21.598 --> 11:25.261
there was more between
me and Lucky besides wood.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.844
Look, he was married,
so I’m that woman.

11:28.939 --> 11:32.648
— Oh. So Mr. Milner was married?
— Yes, but he was gonna leave her.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.567
Statistically that statement
is unlikely to be true.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.940
Maybe Lucky’s wife didn’t
want to take any chances.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.489
Oh, my God.
Lucky said his wife
was unstable and dangerous,

11:41.577 --> 11:43.408
that he was afraid of her.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.032
That’s why it was taking him
so long to tell her.
Oh, God.

11:46.123 --> 11:50.116
[ Sobbing ]
l’ll die if Lucky
got murdered because of me.

11:50.836 --> 11:53.122
Oh, God.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.454
There, there.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.417
So how long were
you and Lucky married?

12:00.512 --> 12:04.630
Um, three years
next, uh, January.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.306
[ Clears Throat]

12:06.393 --> 12:08.679
Oh, God, this is horrible.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.226
Can I see him?

12:10.314 --> 12:11.804
I’d advise against that.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.606
Your husband’s remains
are pretty badly decomposed.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.979
Huh?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.903
Oh, God. Oh, no.
So he’s like somebody
he cleaned up?

12:19.990 --> 12:21.730
Is that what you’re saying?

12:21.825 --> 12:23.281
That’s ironic, right?

12:23.368 --> 12:25.950
I’m sorry I have to ask,
but were you aware of
the relationship...

12:26.038 --> 12:28.154
that your husband was having
with this Renee Mitchell?

12:29.207 --> 12:32.040
[ Sighs, Scoffs ]
l’m Lucky’s fourth wife.

12:32.127 --> 12:35.210
He met me while he was still
dating his second wife.

12:35.297 --> 12:39.040
I had no illusions about
what kind of man he was.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.962
Did you ever think about
killing your husband?
No!

12:41.053 --> 12:44.136
Lucky was good to me,
and he was great for my kid.

12:44.222 --> 12:47.430
I would have put up
with everything just for
the way he treated Davey.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.223
Why didn’t you
report him missing?

12:49.311 --> 12:51.427
You know, every once in a while,
Luckyjust took off—

12:51.521 --> 12:52.931
Atlantic City mostly.

12:53.065 --> 12:55.021
You sound angry.
Oh, yeah, I’m angry.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.271
l’m angry that bitch
took Lucky away from me.
I’m angry the bastard’s dead.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.819
I am angry that
I don’t know how
I’m gonna live now.

13:02.324 --> 13:06.033
And I’m angry
my boy lost another father,
and that’s the worst.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.787
God.
[ Sniffles ]

13:10.874 --> 13:13.411
Davey thought Lucky
hung the moon.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.121
And it’s gonna break his heart
when | tell him.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.838
So your son and Lucky
were close?
Yeah.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.338
Lucky got him working.
You know, he set him straight.

13:23.428 --> 13:26.170
Lucky told Davey
they’d be partners one day.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.638
— How about you and your son?
- [ Sighs ]

13:31.728 --> 13:34.435
Davey’s my only child.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.935
For a long time,
it was just him and me.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.729
We’d die for each other,
you know?

13:48.078 --> 13:50.114
I’m gonna have
to talk to Davey.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.321
[ Sighs ]
Yeah, sure.
I think he’s working.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.623
I think he’s just doing
some stuff for Lucky right now.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.371
How do |, uh, tell him?

13:57.462 --> 14:00.750
You know, I mean, how do |—
[ Sniffles ]

14:00.841 --> 14:02.832
how do | tell him Lucky’s gone?

14:05.971 --> 14:08.758
[Crying ]
How do | tell him
we’re alone again?

14:12.894 --> 14:15.351
[Angela] | used
photo—modeling software...

14:15.439 --> 14:18.681
to create a 3—D digital image
of the victim’s skull,

14:18.775 --> 14:21.517
including the damage
that was done to the occipital.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.233
Definitely sharp-force trauma.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.530
Yeah. Next | used
an algorithm to compare...

14:27.617 --> 14:31.485
the size and shape of
the most common tools used
during a crime scene cleanup.

14:31.580 --> 14:35.289
You think the victim
may have been killed
with his own tools?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.036
I don’t know.
I just needed
to start someplace.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.833
l’ll pull up
what I found.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.626
Hodgins told me
that Arastoo is a poet.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.878
- Yes, I know.
- You knew he was a poet?

14:45.969 --> 14:48.927
I read a rubaiyat
he wrote on the back
of an evidence report.

14:49.014 --> 14:52.006
He didn’t think I would notice
because it was in Farsi.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.761
Why didn’t you tell me?

14:53.852 --> 14:55.763
— He apologized.
— Apologized?

14:55.854 --> 14:59.096
He knew he shouldn’t have written
on Jeffersonian documentation.

14:59.191 --> 15:00.681
No, honey—
[ Stammers ]

15:00.776 --> 15:03.142
What about the poem?
Did he translate it for you?

15:03.236 --> 15:05.898
No need.
Although my Farsi is rusty,

15:05.989 --> 15:09.823
I recognized that it was
very beautiful...

15:09.910 --> 15:12.151
and... very sexual.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.870
So what are these?
Huh?

15:15.957 --> 15:19.040
Okay, uh, all these
wrecking bar-style tools...

15:19.127 --> 15:21.368
fit the basic profile
of the murder weapon,

15:21.463 --> 15:24.830
and they’re sold
at the lumber store
where Renee works.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.792
The curved edge is
the right size and angle...

15:27.886 --> 15:29.797
to have caused the trauma.

15:29.888 --> 15:33.506
Yeah, but the sides don’t
match the serrated marks
you found on the skull.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.428
Hmm, a claw hammer?
Yeah.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.680
Look at the serrated edges
on the clawed end.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.941
They seem to match up perfectly
with the abrasions,

15:45.028 --> 15:49.271
and the hammer face
could be used to smash in
the mandible and maxilla.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.822
That is great.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.116
Arastoo is a poet, huh?

15:53.203 --> 15:56.536
I am— I am reallyjust
gonna be looking at him
in a whole new way.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.864
[Speaking Farsi ]

16:06.383 --> 16:07.543
Damn.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.374
I told you it was beautiful.

16:11.138 --> 16:14.096
I started writing
in my first year
at university in Tehran.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.298
That was 1997.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.891
Wow, I’m impressed.
It seems I impressed
the authorities too.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.015
After the election,
we all thought that
the Khatami regime...

16:21.106 --> 16:23.222
would be more open
to secular work,

16:23.316 --> 16:25.181
but I was expelled
from school.

16:25.277 --> 16:27.484
Why?
What were you writing?

16:27.571 --> 16:32.031
l was 18.
Love, freedom, democracy, sex.

16:32.117 --> 16:35.701
l was foolish
and published the poems
with an underground press,

16:35.787 --> 16:38.199
so I had to leave the country
before I was arrested.

16:38.290 --> 16:39.871
You are amazing.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.199
What I am is a man
who can’t go home...

16:42.294 --> 16:45.286
and a man who will lose his job
if we don’t get back to work.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.336
Right. Yeah. So...

16:47.424 --> 16:51.508
turns out the tissue lesions
we found were caused by
proteases, amylases,

16:51.595 --> 16:54.837
cellulases and lipases
that were placed on
the victim’s remains.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.671
— Enzymes?
— Yeah, these supercharged,

16:56.766 --> 17:01.385
biodegradable cleaning agents
that break down organic material
on a molecular level.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.731
So the killer wanted
to hasten decomposition.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.431
Yes, the composition
of this cleaning agent
fits with the fact, too,

17:06.526 --> 17:09.268
that our victim worked
cleaning up crime scenes.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.444
So the killer had access
to the dead man’s material.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.271
Yeah, it looks that way.

- Well, your mother
was concerned about you.
— I’m okay.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.426
But she’s right.
You liked Lucky.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.097
Look, I didn’t do great
in high school.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.267
I got into fights.
I got high a lot.

17:42.354 --> 17:45.141

to work with him after school.
He paid me.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.814
After graduating,
I started working full—time.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.607

— You’re gonna miss him.
— I’m fine.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.612

Try and take over
his business.

I had what it took
to be partner one day.

Okay. But you’re pretty young
to run your own business.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.662

What else will me
and my mom do for money?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.785
— You care about your mother.
— Yeah. So?

18:04.876 --> 18:07.333
Were you aware that Lucky
wasn’t faithful to her?

18:08.546 --> 18:11.003
Look, sometimes on a job,
Lucky would send me away.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.752
I knew why.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.800
And Lucky must have known that
you knew he was cheating on her.

18:15.887 --> 18:19.095
Lucky had a code, all right?
He said in a marriage
you treat your woman good.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.764
You bring home the bacon.
You treat her with respect.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.978
But?

18:24.062 --> 18:27.225
But a man has a life.
He works hard,
he plays hard.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.180
What do you think of that?

18:29.276 --> 18:32.734
I think if he works hard
and he plays hard, he—
maybe he dies hard too.

18:32.821 --> 18:36.188
Hmm. So you’re saying
that cheating has consequences.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.906
After working with Lucky,

18:38.994 --> 18:41.610
you must be pretty good
at cleaning up evidence.

18:41.705 --> 18:44.321
— I didn’t kill Lucky.
— I wasn’t thinking of you.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.906
l was thinking of your mom.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.669
Now, if she realized
that you could run
the business on your own,

18:51.756 --> 18:53.257
she wouldn’t
need Lucky anymore.

Don’t talk shop in the house.

- Yeah.

involving finding a home.

Since he grew up an orphan,
the anger he’s sublimated...

19:47.270 --> 19:51.309
has paralyzed him from
developing a healthy perspective
on what having a home means.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.856
That made him bond with us
and our home,

19:53.943 --> 19:56.730
so he didn’t have
to deal with his own
emotional insecurities.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.734
Melvin had to lowball the bid,
then raise the price later.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.437
Right. So with Lucky
out of the way,

20:40.532 --> 20:43.740
Grim Sweeper Cleaning
is the only crime scene
cleanup business in town.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.284
What, so now it’s okay
to talk shop in the house?

20:46.371 --> 20:48.236
Well, we have a murderer
to catch, Booth.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.196
Yeah, Dr. Brennan’s
100% right on this.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.747
Okay, just because
you’re buttering her up...

20:51.835 --> 20:53.700
doesn’t mean you have to
stop looking for a place.

20:53.837 --> 20:57.125
I’m not buttering her up.
Want some more wine?
I don’t think— Thank you.

21:01.344 --> 21:03.300
Well, thanks for
coming in, Mr. Carville.

21:03.388 --> 21:06.175
Hey, F.B.l. sends guys to get you,
what’s gonna happen?

21:06.266 --> 21:07.722
You’re gonna go with ’em.

21:07.851 --> 21:09.887
Is that—
Blood? Yeah.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.593
And a little bit of brain.

21:11.729 --> 21:14.721
Oh.
Like I said, your people came
and got me straight from work.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.556
l was cleaning up
a shotgun suicide.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.183
Come—
This is what that looks like.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.768
You couldn’t have
taken that off?

21:19.863 --> 21:21.899
I didn’t want
to keep the FBI. waiting.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.488
So is this about Lucky?
Charles Milner, yeah.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.191
How’d Lucky buy the farm?

21:26.286 --> 21:29.494
— Someone bashed his head in.
- You think it was me?

21:29.581 --> 21:33.165
You’re business competitors.
You instigated legal proceedings
against the victim.

21:33.251 --> 21:34.912
That lawsuit?
You check. You’ll see.

21:35.003 --> 21:36.959
That got dropped
way before Lucky died.

21:37.088 --> 21:38.464
You know why?
Why?

21:38.548 --> 21:40.209
Because me and Lucky got smart.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.791
Always bidding
against each other
drove down both our incomes.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.838
You decided
to split the bids?
No.

21:44.929 --> 21:48.342
We decided to join forces.
Carville & Milner Cleaning Services.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.765
We were just about to get
the name registered
and everything.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.592
So you’re saying that if
you were gonna murder Lucky,

21:52.729 --> 21:55.641
you would have waited till
the merger was over so you could
keep the whole company?

21:55.732 --> 21:58.644
No. I’m saying
I would never murder anyone.

21:58.735 --> 22:02.694
But you know who didn’t
want us to join forces?
That kid.

22:02.780 --> 22:06.147
- What kid?
- Davey. Lucky’s stepson,
the heir apparent.

22:06.242 --> 22:07.982
Thanks for the tip.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.819
Meanwhile, we have a warrant
to examine your tools for blood.

22:10.914 --> 22:12.779
You— You’re gonna
check my tools for blood?

22:12.874 --> 22:15.206
You know what I do
for a living, right?

22:15.335 --> 22:17.417
Yes.
Every one of those tools...

22:17.504 --> 22:18.994
is gonna have blood
all over ’em.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.749
— So will Lucky’s tools.
- Right.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.047
You know what?
You tell Dr. Brennan and them...

22:23.134 --> 22:25.876
that their best chance
to find Lucky’s blood...

22:25.970 --> 22:28.461
is to check
the stepson’s toolbox first.

22:32.393 --> 22:35.260
[ Arastoo ]
These tools belong
to Melvin Carville,

22:35.355 --> 22:38.768
and these belong to
the victim and his stepson.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.144
There is blood on
every single one of Melvin’s.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.268
What about
Davey Benson’s tools?
Not a trace.

22:43.404 --> 22:46.271
Completely clean.
This looks like a pretty good
match to the murder weapon.

22:46.366 --> 22:49.904
Unfortunately,
a lot of people have that tool,
including Lucky and his stepson.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.326
So I compared
Lucky’s roll of plastic...

22:52.413 --> 22:55.325
to the sheeting
that Booth confiscated
from Melvin Carville.

22:55.416 --> 22:58.658
Melvin uses this high—grade
polyvinylidene chloride,

22:58.753 --> 23:01.711
which is basically like
a bionic Saran Wrap, right?

23:01.798 --> 23:05.040
While Lucky, he uses this
bargain—basement sheeting...

23:05.134 --> 23:07.625
that is basically
molecularly unstable.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.927
I mean, this is
the cheapest stuff
that money can buy.

23:10.056 --> 23:13.014
Which one made our pod?
Well, I compared isotopes...

23:13.101 --> 23:15.888
from each brand of sheeting
with the plastic from our pod.

23:15.979 --> 23:17.810
The winner is...

23:18.815 --> 23:20.305
turkey number three.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.732
- The pod was made
from Lucky’s plastic sheeting.
— Correct.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.686
Indicating that he was killed
at one of his own job sites.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.361
Yeah. That’s
a reasonable conclusion.

23:29.993 --> 23:31.949
I got your text,
Dr. Saroyan.
Did you need something?

23:32.036 --> 23:35.745
Remember when you
wrote my name out in Farsi?

23:35.832 --> 23:37.788
Yes.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.833
This is it here, isn’t it?

23:43.006 --> 23:44.667
Yes.

23:46.384 --> 23:48.170
You wrote a poem to me?

23:50.221 --> 23:52.177
Are you certain you want
to discuss this here?

23:53.725 --> 23:55.636
Just”

23:55.727 --> 23:57.843
would you say it for me?

24:06.237 --> 24:10.731
[Speaking Farsi ]

24:35.850 --> 24:39.468
I... didn’t understand
a word of that.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.606
— I think you did.
— Oh.

24:47.737 --> 24:50.649
So—So far, I have isolated...

24:50.740 --> 24:52.901
blood from
four different people.

24:52.992 --> 24:56.576
None of it is
the victim’s blood, so I—

24:56.663 --> 24:58.574
I’ll come back later.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.865
No. Dr. Hodgins?

25:02.502 --> 25:04.083
[Murmurs]
|_

25:05.171 --> 25:06.877
What did you find
on the tools?
Huh?

25:06.964 --> 25:10.377
Uh, we checked all of them
for blood, but only one set
tested positive.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.546
Whose tools?
Uh, Melvin Carville’s.

25:12.637 --> 25:15.595
The stepson
and the victim’s tools
were scrubbed clean.

25:15.682 --> 25:19.266
This may be the first time
that a lack of blood looks more
suspicious than buckets of it.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.434
You’re suggesting
that it was the stepson?

25:21.521 --> 25:23.477
Why else would he clean
the tools so carefully?

25:23.606 --> 25:26.268
He obviously
has something to hide.
Nothing special about that.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.020
People always have
something to hide.

25:28.111 --> 25:32.354
Perhaps the boy cleaned
his tools because he is serious
about doing a good job.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.484
Dr. Brennan, do you think
Melvin Carville’s our killer?

25:34.575 --> 25:36.076
- Yes.
— Based on—

25:37.245 --> 25:39.611
Seriously?
You’re working a hunch here?

25:39.706 --> 25:41.537
Melvin Carville
told Sweets specifically...

25:41.624 --> 25:43.489
to tell me personally
where to look for blood.

25:43.584 --> 25:44.960
— Like a challenge?
- Yes.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.909
Oh, you are most definitely
working a hunch.

25:47.004 --> 25:50.371
Hey, then I might have
some actual physical evidence
that will help.

25:52.510 --> 25:55.547
You narrowed down the sixjobs
where he was using
the cheap wood?

25:55.638 --> 25:57.503
Yeah.
The key is asbestos.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.598
The fiber Arastoo extracted
from the skull?
Mm—hmm.

26:00.685 --> 26:04.519
Actinolite asbestos.
It’s used in homes
built before 1970.

26:04.605 --> 26:08.018
How many of Milner’s job sites
were built before 1970?

26:08.109 --> 26:11.101
Uh— One.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.186
It was a home invasion murder
of an old lady...

26:13.281 --> 26:15.317
on H Street near the Red Line.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.148
Hey, if Booth can
get us in there,

26:17.243 --> 26:20.326
I guarantee we’ll be able
to find something that ties
the victim to the crime scene.

26:20.413 --> 26:23.029
— [ Sighs ]
— Dr. Brennan?

26:23.124 --> 26:25.080
lfthe killer
is Melvin Carville,

26:25.168 --> 26:27.250
the place will be
wiped clean of all evidence.

26:27.336 --> 26:30.578
Milner’s stepson, Davey Benson,
knew that Milner was cheating
on his mother.

26:30.673 --> 26:34.666
Plus, Davey is also
a trained crime scene
cleanup expert.

26:34.761 --> 26:38.925
lt’s ironic that while
all we care about
is preserving evidence,

26:39.015 --> 26:41.301
theirjob is to
wipe it out of existence.

26:41.392 --> 26:45.055
Like some kind of
primeval struggle
between us and them.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.487
Hodgins.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.983
Oh. Hey. What?

26:56.115 --> 26:58.071
Come on, man.
I don’t know what
you’re talking about.

26:58.201 --> 27:00.692
I didn’t see anything.
Okay.
I think that’s best too.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.948
You are totally making it
with the boss!

27:03.039 --> 27:05.280
— No!
- That was a love poem
you read to her.

27:05.374 --> 27:06.910
Do you speak Farsi?
No, you don’t.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.502
I’m a romantic.
I know what I heard.

27:08.586 --> 27:10.451
You have no idea
what that poem was.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.537
Oh, I got it.
And so did Cam.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.588
And she was not surprised.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.712
How long have you two
been together?

27:17.804 --> 27:19.669
My life is in your hands.

27:19.764 --> 27:22.631
You can either ruin
the best thing that has
ever happened to me,

27:22.725 --> 27:27.344
or you can remain silent and
earn my everlasting gratitude.

27:34.946 --> 27:36.937
[Sighs]

27:43.162 --> 27:44.663
You remember this place?

27:44.747 --> 27:46.203
Yep. Home invasion.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.155
Some dudes killed
the old lady who lived here...

27:48.251 --> 27:50.116
’cause they thought
she had a stash of cash.

27:50.211 --> 27:52.327
I mean, me and Lucky
did good work.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.457
There was blood everywhere
and chunky bits.

27:54.549 --> 27:57.791
But now you can hardly tell
a murder went down.

27:57.927 --> 27:59.883
I could find evidence.
I doubt it.

27:59.971 --> 28:02.132
Lucky was good at his job,
and so am I.

28:02.223 --> 28:05.511
Well, you keep boasting
about these kind of things,
you’re gonna end up in jail.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.592
He’s boasting because
he didn’t do it, Booth.

28:07.728 --> 28:10.470
You didn’t find the cash.
Oh, Lucky and I looked for it,
but there wasn’t any.

28:10.565 --> 28:13.398
You know,
Melvin Carville told us
that you didn’t want, uh,

28:13.484 --> 28:15.020
him and Lucky
in business together.

28:15.111 --> 28:17.397
Well, at first I didn’t,
but then Lucky showed me...

28:17.488 --> 28:19.444
how it would mean
more money for all of us.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.898
’Cause if they were
in business together,
you wouldn’t be half owner.

28:21.993 --> 28:25.156
- I guess.
- And now you would get
the whole shebang.

28:25.246 --> 28:27.157
[Scoffs]
I’m 18. I’m a rookie.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.284
How am I supposed to get
business from Grim Sweeper?

28:29.375 --> 28:30.990
Is this the last place
you saw Lucky?

28:31.085 --> 28:32.621
Yeah.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.202
Over there.

28:34.297 --> 28:37.255
He told me to go on home.
He was gonna
take care of it himself.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.332
[ Booth ]
Now, why would
he do that?

28:39.427 --> 28:41.759
Mmm. I don’t know.
Maybe because he was
cleaning these places up...

28:41.846 --> 28:43.336
and meeting other women?

28:43.431 --> 28:46.889
He said he was expecting
a delivery. Some flooring.
That’s all I know.

28:46.976 --> 28:49.763
Lucky ever mention a girl
by the name of Renee?

28:49.854 --> 28:52.345
It’s not her, Booth.
Or him or his mother.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.556
- lt’s Melvin Carville.
— Based on what?

28:54.650 --> 28:56.732
My gut, which,
according to Sweets’s book,

28:56.819 --> 29:00.061
is subconscious analysis
bubbling up to consciousness.

29:00.156 --> 29:03.273
No,no,no,no.
It’s my gut that bubbles,
you remember?

29:03.367 --> 29:06.825
— Melvin Carville is the killer.
- Every time you mention
Melvin Carville,

29:06.913 --> 29:09.199
it takes the pressure off
other viable suspects.

29:09.332 --> 29:11.163
I understand.
Thank you.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.911
- But it’s Melvin Carville.
— Just—

29:13.002 --> 29:15.493
So— Renee?
Does it sound familiar?

29:15.588 --> 29:18.170
She’s that skank
from Lumber For Less
where Lucky gets his flooring.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.793
Thank you, Davey.

29:19.884 --> 29:22.796
So, can we at least agree
that there are other motives
and suspects here?

29:22.887 --> 29:24.093
- Yes.
— Thank you.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.796
I want a team of techs
to tear apart this whole place.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.597
Well, I’m gonna talk
to Renee.

29:28.726 --> 29:30.717
It’s not her, Booth.
lt’s Mel—
Stop.

29:30.811 --> 29:34.850
Bones, I got your theory
loud and clear.
You’re right there.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.353
— Melvin Carville.
— Just put it away.
Don’t even think about Melvin.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.183
I can hear you thinking
right now.

29:40.988 --> 29:44.196
Davey said
I was the last person
to see Lucky alive?

29:44.325 --> 29:47.317
Were you?
|— I delivered flooring.
That’s all.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.992
Oh, right.
Come on, Renee.

29:49.080 --> 29:52.243
l-l wanted more,
but Lucky said
he was too busy.

29:52.333 --> 29:55.951
— He sent me packing.
- And how mad did that make you
on a scale from one to 10?

29:56.045 --> 29:59.208
One, being you’re fine with it.
Or 10, you just wanted
to bash his head in.

29:59.298 --> 30:02.040
I loved Lucky.
I didn’t kill him.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.671
- I mean, you do realize
how this sounds?
— Which part?

30:04.762 --> 30:07.549
All of it.
You show up, he rejects you.
You have a delivery van.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.346
You wrap the body in plastic.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.685
You’re saying that stuff.
I’m not saying
any of that stuff.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.851
— Fine.
Who do you think did it?
— His wife and her kid.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.428
It makes sense.
The two of them.

30:15.523 --> 30:17.639
They kill him,
she drives off with the body...

30:17.733 --> 30:21.100
and little Davey
cleans up the mess
just like Lucky taught him.

30:22.905 --> 30:24.691
[Sighs]

30:27.493 --> 30:29.154
[Angela ]
What time is it?

30:29.245 --> 30:31.952
Relax. We have another hour
before we have to
let the sitter go.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.121
— Have another glass.
- [ Chuckling]

30:34.208 --> 30:37.951
You’re right.
We work hard at a revolting job,

30:38.045 --> 30:39.831
and it is
really pretty up here.

30:39.922 --> 30:43.835
I know, right?
And I scanned a poem
from Arastoo’s book.

30:43.926 --> 30:46.542
- And did you learn Farsi too?
- I didn’t have to.

30:46.679 --> 30:49.546
I ran it through
an Internet translator.
Oh, genius.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.552
I am dying to hear

— No, let me gather my thoughts.

41:26.151 --> 41:29.188
That’s exactly why
we have music and poetry, Bones.

41:29.279 --> 41:32.066
Third, your physicality
is remarkable.

41:32.157 --> 41:35.240
Now you give me three
of your top reasons
for loving me.

41:35.327 --> 41:37.534
I don’t have reasons.

41:37.621 --> 41:39.111
[ Chuckles ]

41:39.206 --> 41:40.946
What?

41:41.041 --> 41:43.327
I think what you just said
is very romantic.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.249
What can I say?
I’m a romantic, Bones.

41:45.337 --> 41:47.498
Shall we? Huh?
We shall.

41:47.589 --> 41:50.046
Wine and dine, candle time?

41:50.175 --> 41:52.757
[ Chuckling ]
What does that mean?
I have no idea.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.545
[ Saroyan ]
Do you think Hodgins
will keep our secret?

41:56.682 --> 41:58.968
Yes.
From Angela?

41:59.059 --> 42:01.971
No. I’d be surprised
if she didn’t know
right now.

42:02.062 --> 42:04.553
And do you think Angela
can keep from telling Brennan?

42:04.648 --> 42:06.559
No. Not for long.

42:06.650 --> 42:10.609
Oh, man.
You need to learn how to lie.

42:10.696 --> 42:13.529
I’ll tell you what though.
It stops with Brennan.

42:13.657 --> 42:16.444
You don’t think
she’ll tell Booth?
No, only if he asks.

42:16.535 --> 42:17.741
Oh, God.

42:17.828 --> 42:20.991
And what are the chances
he asks that question?

42:21.081 --> 42:23.197
I’m sorry.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.452
I know you want
to keep this a secret.

42:25.544 --> 42:29.253
Oh, Arastoo, I don’t want
to keep this a secret at all.

42:32.467 --> 42:34.173
Except from
all the other interns.

42:34.261 --> 42:35.626
Definitely.

42:35.762 --> 42:39.129
And everyone who works
at the Jeffersonian.
Damn straight.

42:41.685 --> 42:43.892
You want me to quit?

42:43.979 --> 42:47.312
And live with that guilt?
Oh, no, thanks.

42:49.025 --> 42:50.981
Soto sum it up,

42:51.069 --> 42:54.937
you want to tell everyone,
but you don’t want
anyone to know.

42:55.031 --> 42:57.522
[ Sighs ]
Crazy, right?

42:58.535 --> 43:00.025
No, it’s poetic.

43:53.632 --> 43:55.042
What’s that mean?
