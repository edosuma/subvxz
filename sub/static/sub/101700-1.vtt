01:29.089 --> 01:31.008
What's in the bag?

01:31.049 --> 01:32.718
I can't say.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.386
Pull yourself together!

01:36.430 --> 01:38.223
Be quiet!

01:47.357 --> 01:50.194
Where's the package? Where is it?

01:50.235 --> 01:52.988
Tell us now or die a traitor!

01:53.030 --> 01:55.622
Fuck you! You'll never find it.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.492
Check the back.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.453
See if anyone is still alive.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.580
Find them right now!

02:01.872 --> 02:04.208
Let's go!

02:05.000 --> 02:06.960
Hey! Listen up...

02:07.002 --> 02:09.128
If we can't find it, we are dead.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.756
Hurry up!

02:11.381 --> 02:13.008
Go to the right.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.510
Over there!

02:15.969 --> 02:18.055
Where is it?

03:00.389 --> 03:02.850
Kinji?

03:05.060 --> 03:06.270
Are you okay?

03:06.311 --> 03:08.814
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. It's just...

03:08.856 --> 03:10.774
What's going on? Where have you been?

03:10.816 --> 03:14.027
Please, just sit down.
There's something I need to tell you.

03:14.069 --> 03:18.657
You're worrying me.
What's going on?

03:19.366 --> 03:22.995
Sakura, please just listen to me.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.998
We have to leave Tokyo.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.042
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean for this to happen.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.503
- When?
- Tonight.

03:31.545 --> 03:36.758
I'll explain more after we've left.
You just have to trust me.

03:36.800 --> 03:43.891
Of course I trust you. But go where?
You mean to another house or city?

03:43.932 --> 03:48.604
No. We have to leave Japan and move to London.
We have to leave now.

03:48.645 --> 03:53.275
- London? But that's...
- l know, but we don't have another choice.

03:53.317 --> 03:58.447
- Has it got something to do with your work?
- I can't say anymore here.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.617
We have to leave right away.

04:02.326 --> 04:05.913
Okay, I trust you.

04:05.954 --> 04:11.710
I'll sort the kids out and pack everything.
I hope you've got a plan for us Kinji.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.212
We can't let anything happen to them.

04:13.253 --> 04:18.509
Of course I do, don't worry. Everything will be fine.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.428
Nothing will happen to any of them.
I promise.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.848
Okay.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.677
Timmy, the food's ready.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.512
Okay, got it.

05:10.958 --> 05:13.627
We've got three more chicken
teriyakis for table eight

05:13.661 --> 05:15.395
and a shrimp sushi
platter for table four.

05:15.429 --> 05:17.263
Okay Mio, coming right up.

05:17.297 --> 05:18.364
Everything all right out there?

05:18.398 --> 05:19.734
Yeah, everything's fine.

05:19.767 --> 05:21.469
I think we have to start
turning people away soon though,

05:21.502 --> 05:22.937
the restaurant's pretty
packed at the moment.

05:22.970 --> 05:24.371
Oh no no no, Mio, we
never turn away customers.

05:24.405 --> 05:26.508
We always find space for
them, no matter what.

05:26.541 --> 05:28.009
Oh course father,

05:28.043 --> 05:29.511
we'll make sure everyone
has a table, don't worry.

05:29.544 --> 05:30.377
Great.

05:31.081 --> 05:35.836
Focus! No mistakes today.

05:37.452 --> 05:38.420
- Hi, thanks again.
- Hello.

05:38.453 --> 05:40.622
Hi Preena, thank you
so much for your help.

05:40.655 --> 05:41.456
No worries.

05:41.490 --> 05:42.289
How was he?

05:42.323 --> 05:43.692
He was a really
good boy, yeah.

05:43.725 --> 05:44.826
Oh thank you, we'll
see you next week.

05:44.860 --> 05:45.794
Yes, bye.

05:47.429 --> 05:48.030
Kinji.

05:48.898 --> 05:50.500
Jumpei's sleeping.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.746
Good night, Junpei.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.794
Sweet dreams.

06:50.094 --> 06:51.830
Should really cut
down on those, Frank,

06:51.863 --> 06:53.631
before I have to start
cooking for your kitchen, too.

06:53.665 --> 06:55.767
How you doing, Kinji?

06:55.800 --> 06:57.669
I'm good, thanks.

06:57.702 --> 06:58.603
Busy day?

06:58.636 --> 07:00.039
Oh yeah, you could say that.

07:00.072 --> 07:01.607
Got an earful from my staff

07:01.640 --> 07:02.741
so I came down
here for an escape.

07:02.775 --> 07:04.510
Ah, giving you
a hard time again?

07:04.543 --> 07:05.711
Bet your ass they are.

07:05.744 --> 07:07.613
They always want a raise
man, I mean come on.

07:07.646 --> 07:09.615
This is England, the land
of cheap and cheerful,

07:09.648 --> 07:11.750
that's why we came here, right?

07:11.784 --> 07:12.818
Anyway how are you doing?

07:12.852 --> 07:14.420
Looks like you're killing
it, man, good for you.

07:14.453 --> 07:17.423
I, I can't complain,
business is good.

07:17.456 --> 07:18.557
I do work them hard though.

07:18.591 --> 07:19.859
And so you should.

07:19.892 --> 07:22.595
I am thinking of
expanding into catering,

07:22.628 --> 07:25.966
but, Sakura's not sure
I'm ready for it yet.

07:25.999 --> 07:28.602
Why not, that's
a great idea man.

07:28.635 --> 07:29.769
Want me to talk to her?

07:29.803 --> 07:31.671
Maybe she'll buy the American
bullshit, greed is good.

07:33.673 --> 07:34.674
Great seeing you, Frank.

07:34.708 --> 07:36.076
You too, man.

07:36.109 --> 07:37.043
Go easy on your staff.

07:37.077 --> 07:38.678
Come on.

07:38.712 --> 07:40.881
I gotta get going
but, I'll see you soon.

07:40.914 --> 07:42.482
Hey, not if I see you first.

07:42.515 --> 07:43.183
Karate!

07:44.784 --> 07:45.919
See you later man.

07:45.952 --> 07:46.953
Convince her.

07:47.822 --> 07:48.956
Catering's a good idea.

08:02.236 --> 08:06.674
And this is the edimame,
your favorite, I assume.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.144
And your drink's
not here, is it?

08:10.177 --> 08:12.748
I'll get it for you right now.

08:16.079 --> 08:19.875
- How was everything?
- The food was great.

08:19.917 --> 08:24.296
- Please send my compliments to the chef.
- Thank you so much.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.675
How long have you had the restaurand for, may I ask?

08:30.010 --> 08:35.557
Must be 3 years now!
Time certainly does fly.

08:35.599 --> 08:38.143
Well you've certainly achieved a lot in 3 years.

08:38.184 --> 08:44.942
Thank you. We're still growing!
My husband has a lot of ideas.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.069
I can imagine.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.489
That must be the chef?

08:50.531 --> 08:52.574
Kinji.

08:54.535 --> 08:58.121
This gentleman was just paying you
a very nice compliment.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.791
Thank you so much.
My name is Kinji.

09:00.832 --> 09:05.546
- Yasuyuki.
- It's a pleasure to have you here.

09:05.587 --> 09:10.592
I've been trying to find a good
Japanese restaurant in London!

09:10.634 --> 09:14.346
I see. You are welcome back anytime, Yasuyuki.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.139
I will definitely be back. Thank you.

09:16.181 --> 09:21.687
Well, we are closing the kitchen soon.
It was nice to meet you, Yasuyuki.

09:21.728 --> 09:25.774
- Yes. Thank you.
- Excuse me.

09:25.816 --> 09:29.778
- Lovely to meet you.
- And you.

09:33.949 --> 09:38.745
Prawns, prawns, prawns...

09:38.787 --> 09:41.248
Carrot...
Boss, join us!

09:41.290 --> 09:43.125
Okay!

09:43.166 --> 09:46.753
- What's going on in here!?
- Let's dance, Mio!

09:46.795 --> 09:50.195
Prawns, prawns, prawns...

09:54.845 --> 09:56.322
Sorry, boss. I'm so sorry.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.063
So just send
everything to me, okay.

10:04.096 --> 10:06.098
I gotta go, I gotta go, bye.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.028
Jinpei!

10:14.374 --> 10:15.942
- Daddy!
- Having fun?

10:15.976 --> 10:17.844
I made a new friend today.

10:17.878 --> 10:18.678
Oh?

10:18.712 --> 10:20.047
He's called Masaki.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.815
Masaki, nice to meet you.

10:21.848 --> 10:23.016
Nice to meet you.

10:24.684 --> 10:26.119
Can we go play longer?

10:26.153 --> 10:28.755
I'm sorry, Jumpei, but I gotta
get back to the restaurant.

10:28.789 --> 10:29.356
Please?

10:29.389 --> 10:30.991
Tomorrow, I promise.

10:31.965 --> 10:36.762
- Kinji. Good to see you.
- Yasuyuki.

10:36.803 --> 10:40.516
I didn't know you had a son at the same school?

10:40.557 --> 10:44.895
Yes, he started a few weeks ago.

10:44.937 --> 10:46.772
What a coincidence!

10:46.813 --> 10:51.068
- It's a great school. He's in safe hands.
- Yes, so I've heard.

10:51.145 --> 10:52.180
Can we go play?

10:53.081 --> 10:53.981
Just for a minute, yeah.

10:54.015 --> 10:54.816
Okay.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.909
You should stop by the restaurant again.

10:58.951 --> 11:02.621
Bring your wife or a friend next time.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.832
My wife is out of town at the moment...

11:05.874 --> 11:10.420
but I may stop by again.
Thank you for the offer.

11:10.462 --> 11:14.550
You're welcome. We also have a new menu.

11:14.591 --> 11:19.805
New menu? That sounds very tempting.

11:19.847 --> 11:24.977
- Okay, I'll see you tonight.
- Great! See you later, Yasuyuki.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.938
Thank you. See you later.

11:28.218 --> 11:30.386
Jumpei, we do need to go.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.122
Masaki, nice to meet you.

11:32.155 --> 11:32.956
Bye.

11:32.989 --> 11:34.290
See you.

11:34.324 --> 11:35.291
He seems nice.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.333
Well hello again!

11:48.375 --> 11:53.797
- Great to see you back so soon.
- Thank you, it's nice to be back.

11:53.839 --> 11:57.843
Kinji told me about the new menu.
I would love to try it!

11:57.885 --> 12:02.848
Yes, it's a little different to what you
might expect.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.476
Is that right?
Looking forward to it.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.854
Mio, Mio!

12:11.523 --> 12:12.900
Hello!

12:12.941 --> 12:15.068
Mio, take Yasuyuki to a table.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.196
- This way, please.
- Sure.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.448
Enjoy!

12:21.241 --> 12:23.911
Here we go, best table in the house.

12:23.952 --> 12:28.540
- Thank you, that's very kind.
- And here is a menu for you.

12:42.895 --> 12:43.729
Boo!

12:51.804 --> 12:53.206
Hi, can I help?

12:55.007 --> 12:57.343
A table for
three, in the back.

13:00.247 --> 13:04.017
Would you be eating
or just drinking?

13:07.455 --> 13:09.756
Depends how good is the food.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.325
Where is your husband?

13:11.358 --> 13:12.359
My husband?

13:13.894 --> 13:15.162
Your husband.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.196
I imagine he is the boss.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.197
Where is the boss?

13:18.832 --> 13:21.835
Well, we both
own the restaurant,

13:21.868 --> 13:23.371
so we're both in charge.

13:26.207 --> 13:29.310
You are a woman, your
husband is the boss.

13:31.379 --> 13:32.213
Where is he?

13:33.549 --> 13:37.318
He's busy in the
kitchen at the moment.

13:37.352 --> 13:40.421
Very smart, he's the
chef too, very good.

13:41.624 --> 13:45.393
Tell him we will wait for
him there when he's finished.

13:46.595 --> 13:49.031
We close at 11:00 PM.

13:49.064 --> 13:50.432
We will wait.

13:53.936 --> 13:58.340
And bring a bottle of
vodka for our palette.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.822
- Kinji.
- What's wrong?

14:23.864 --> 14:27.284
Some strange men just walked into the restaurant.
They want to talk to you.

14:27.326 --> 14:30.412
Why do they want to talk to me?
What do you mean?

14:30.454 --> 14:35.125
They said they wanted to talk to the boss
and will wait until we're finished.

14:35.167 --> 14:39.296
Who are they? What do they want?

14:39.963 --> 14:42.049
I have no idea who they are.

14:42.090 --> 14:47.054
Don't worry, I'll talk to them.
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding...

14:47.095 --> 14:49.139
and they have the wrong place.

14:49.181 --> 14:53.018
It doesn't look like it!
They're drinking vodka.

14:53.060 --> 14:58.148
Don't worry, Sakura, everything will be okay.
Let's finish the orders first.

14:58.190 --> 15:02.986
As soon as we are done, take Mio home.
I will close up the restaurant. Okay?

15:03.028 --> 15:04.488
Okay.

15:04.530 --> 15:09.076
Just make sure they leave and don't come back.

15:09.117 --> 15:13.163
- They are scaring our customers away.
- Understood.

15:37.778 --> 15:39.245
Everything okay?

15:39.278 --> 15:40.113
Yeah?

15:41.013 --> 15:43.116
Ah, you must be the boss.

15:44.317 --> 15:47.187
Please sit, we've
been waiting for you.

15:49.356 --> 15:52.192
My wife says you wanted to
talk to me, how can I help?

15:53.260 --> 15:54.328
Yes and you have a,

15:56.598 --> 16:00.334
a very charming wife,
but to business.

16:02.704 --> 16:03.538
Business?

16:04.506 --> 16:07.007
Yes, you have a business,

16:07.040 --> 16:10.911
and now your business
is my business.

16:12.548 --> 16:14.315
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

16:16.384 --> 16:18.052
How long have
you had this place?

16:18.987 --> 16:20.255
Three years.

16:20.288 --> 16:22.257
Three years, long time.

16:23.626 --> 16:25.895
It's time you start
to pay your fees.

16:26.662 --> 16:28.296
Fees?

16:28.329 --> 16:32.033
Yes, your fees, for having
a restaurant in London.

16:33.234 --> 16:36.338
Everybody in this
town pays someone,

16:37.741 --> 16:39.643
and that someone is me.

16:42.111 --> 16:44.514
I'm sorry, I
still don't follow.

16:44.548 --> 16:47.651
This is our restaurant,
we have no debts,

16:47.684 --> 16:48.485
there's no one we need...

16:48.518 --> 16:49.952
You have a debt now!

16:50.720 --> 16:52.154
That debt belongs to me.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.358
Now let me explain how
it's going to work.

16:57.393 --> 16:59.764
The last Friday of every month,

16:59.797 --> 17:04.535
you will give us 20%
of what you make.

17:04.569 --> 17:06.604
Your turnover, not your profit.

17:08.438 --> 17:12.209
We will check your books,
we will check your tills,

17:12.242 --> 17:14.277
so you can hide nothing from us.

17:14.311 --> 17:16.714
I'm sorry, but that's
never gonna happen.

17:16.747 --> 17:19.282
The money we make here
is our hard earned money.

17:19.316 --> 17:22.720
And now some of that
hard earned money is mine!

17:26.692 --> 17:31.697
It's very simple, if you don't
pay we will hurt your family.

17:33.799 --> 17:35.767
And we will hurt you.

17:35.801 --> 17:37.335
Just leave my family alone.

17:39.370 --> 17:41.640
I will pay you what you want.

17:41.673 --> 17:43.040
Good.

17:43.074 --> 17:45.811
Finally, we are coming
to an understanding.

17:45.844 --> 17:47.547
I'm starting to like this man.

17:49.081 --> 17:53.118
Now remember, the last
Friday of every month,

17:53.151 --> 17:56.221
you will have the
money ready, yes?

17:59.124 --> 17:59.726
Good.

18:00.860 --> 18:01.694
We are done.

18:09.464 --> 18:10.632
Have you done your homework?

18:10.674 --> 18:14.803
Yeah, but I haven't read the book
so I might get told off.

18:14.845 --> 18:19.433
You haven't read it? I'm sure you'll be fine.

18:21.147 --> 18:21.782
Dad.

18:21.815 --> 18:22.883
Hm?

18:22.917 --> 18:24.518
Who were those men at
the restaurant last night?

18:25.486 --> 18:26.754
Who's that?

18:26.787 --> 18:28.087
You know who I mean.

18:30.123 --> 18:31.492
Oh those guys.

18:31.525 --> 18:33.861
They were nobody, don't worry.

18:33.894 --> 18:34.728
Just some people who wanted

18:34.762 --> 18:37.097
to make themselves
known in the area.

18:37.131 --> 18:39.568
Big cities sometimes
attract strange people.

18:41.402 --> 18:42.403
Thank you mommy.

18:42.436 --> 18:43.237
Can I stop?

18:43.270 --> 18:45.139
Of course, Jumpei.

18:45.172 --> 18:46.808
They were more
than strange, dad.

18:46.841 --> 18:48.275
The way they were
looking at people.

18:48.309 --> 18:51.111
Mio, your father
have dealt with it.

18:51.145 --> 18:52.079
Don't worry about them.

18:54.816 --> 18:58.520
Anyway, what have you
got on at college, today?

18:58.553 --> 19:01.657
Oh just preparing for
the exams, nothing crazy.

19:01.691 --> 19:03.391
Well that sounds important.

19:03.425 --> 19:05.861
Anything you want
us to help you with?

19:05.895 --> 19:08.864
No mom, I'm fine, but thanks.

19:08.898 --> 19:09.832
Oh, I gotta go.

19:09.865 --> 19:11.767
I'll see you both at
the restaurant later?

19:13.803 --> 19:14.637
Bye.

19:15.938 --> 19:16.772
Bye, dad.

19:18.239 --> 19:19.240
Kinji.

19:19.274 --> 19:20.175
Hm?

19:20.208 --> 19:21.142
Mio said goodbye.

19:22.143 --> 19:24.581
Oh, I'm sorry honey,
I'll see you tonight.

19:24.615 --> 19:25.849
Good luck at school.

19:25.882 --> 19:27.951
Oh, it's called
college now, dad.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.754
- Bye...
- Bye!

19:36.359 --> 19:41.263
Kinji, I really do hope
they won't be coming back.

19:41.297 --> 19:43.767
Please tell me you
have dealt with them.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.201
Of course.

19:45.234 --> 19:46.938
No, they just wanted to
make themselves known.

19:46.971 --> 19:49.306
Anyway, you know
me, I have a plan.

19:49.339 --> 19:50.240
I always have a plan.

19:52.677 --> 19:54.846
Do they have anything
to do with Doku?

19:57.882 --> 19:58.916
No.

19:58.950 --> 19:59.951
No no, of course not.

19:59.984 --> 20:01.853
Why would you say that?

20:01.886 --> 20:03.186
That's long in the past.

20:05.857 --> 20:08.238
Actually, thinking of
that, I do need to go.

20:08.309 --> 20:11.378
Right... I'm leaving.

20:11.420 --> 20:16.508
Junpei, be a good boy.

20:18.969 --> 20:21.430
See you at the restaurant.

20:21.471 --> 20:27.728
I need to do a few things before we open.

20:27.769 --> 20:30.981
- Okay. See you later.
- Bye bye.

20:45.364 --> 20:47.332
Excuse me, is Frank around?

20:47.366 --> 20:48.434
Sleep right here.

20:49.502 --> 20:51.538
Sorry, is Frank here?

20:54.306 --> 20:57.342
He's probably out back, man.

20:57.376 --> 20:59.345
Out, there?

21:00.481 --> 21:01.448
He's out the back.

21:02.449 --> 21:03.450
Okay.

21:05.452 --> 21:06.453
Thanks.

21:14.495 --> 21:15.730
Frank?

21:15.763 --> 21:16.697
Kinji, um.

21:17.631 --> 21:19.332
Uh what do you, what,
how'd you find me?

21:19.365 --> 21:20.333
What are you doing here?

21:20.366 --> 21:21.301
Your staff told me.

21:21.334 --> 21:22.771
Where are your customers?

21:22.804 --> 21:25.339
Um, thank you Brittany,
um you're doing very well.

21:25.372 --> 21:27.509
We'll take care of that
next week, all right.

21:29.343 --> 21:32.481
Um, my customers are, um,

21:34.549 --> 21:36.685
okay business isn't
doing that well.

21:36.718 --> 21:38.385
I don't think your
staff are helping.

21:38.419 --> 21:40.555
Yeah, I mean tell me about it.

21:40.589 --> 21:41.757
It's all going to shit.

21:43.492 --> 21:44.693
Listen, can we talk somewhere?

21:44.726 --> 21:45.761
Yeah sure.

21:45.794 --> 21:48.363
Oh, just, by the way that, that,

21:48.396 --> 21:49.297
wasn't what it looked like.

21:49.331 --> 21:51.934
That was just a staff thing.

21:52.835 --> 21:54.402
Yeah, sure.

21:54.436 --> 21:55.270
Okay.

21:57.372 --> 21:58.241
Hey guys, listen up.

21:58.273 --> 21:59.876
I want you to go for
lunch, all right.

21:59.909 --> 22:01.544
When you come back I
want you scrubbing tables

22:01.577 --> 22:03.513
or trying to get
customers in here.

22:03.546 --> 22:05.615
Or you're both fucking
fired, comprende?

22:05.648 --> 22:07.315
Let's go, let's go!

22:09.886 --> 22:11.454
Well, this is obviously

22:11.488 --> 22:13.456
where I'm doing
something wrong, Kinji.

22:14.892 --> 22:17.027
I mean, for a while we
had it really good there.

22:18.427 --> 22:19.395
Then the bloody
Russians showed up

22:19.428 --> 22:21.598
and all our customers went away.

22:21.632 --> 22:25.569
Whoa, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

22:27.604 --> 22:29.840
Aw geez, they haven't
called you already, have they?

22:31.407 --> 22:33.544
Oh shit man, you're screwed.

22:34.746 --> 22:35.914
Well how do they
get away with it?

22:35.947 --> 22:37.949
I mean, what do they want?

22:38.783 --> 22:39.651
Okay look.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.053
In London there's
always somebody

22:42.086 --> 22:43.188
calling the shots
behind the scenes.

22:43.221 --> 22:46.825
Could be the English, the
Irish, Russians, whatever.

22:46.858 --> 22:48.059
It's always one of them.

22:49.594 --> 22:51.529
When they smell a business
that's doing well,

22:51.563 --> 22:54.364
that's when they call on you.

22:54.398 --> 22:56.433
It's usually two
or three years in.

22:57.468 --> 22:58.636
Wait, did they do this to you?

22:58.670 --> 22:59.505
Yup.

23:01.106 --> 23:02.575
And what happened,
did you pay them?

23:02.608 --> 23:03.742
You bet your ass I did.

23:03.776 --> 23:05.611
I mean not right
away, but eventually.

23:06.612 --> 23:08.080
'Cause you don't pay them,

23:08.113 --> 23:10.149
they make your
life a living hell.

23:10.182 --> 23:12.484
Not to mention what they
do to your restaurant.

23:12.518 --> 23:13.418
What do you mean?

23:15.054 --> 23:18.490
Those burns up there,
yeah that was them.

23:19.457 --> 23:21.727
And after they torched the
place they threatened my family

23:21.760 --> 23:24.430
and that's when I
knew I had to pay.

23:24.464 --> 23:26.666
Which I did for
six months or so,

23:26.700 --> 23:28.802
while we still had customers.

23:28.835 --> 23:31.538
Then all the sudden,
customers went away

23:31.571 --> 23:32.873
and the business
turned upside down

23:32.906 --> 23:34.541
and the Russians
haven't been back since,

23:34.574 --> 23:36.776
which, maybe it's a blessing.

23:39.179 --> 23:40.446
So what are you saying, I,

23:40.480 --> 23:43.750
I just turn away my customers
and I hope that they go away.

23:43.783 --> 23:45.151
No Kinji, that's not.

23:46.687 --> 23:49.957
Okay, what I'm saying
is don't fight it.

23:49.991 --> 23:51.792
Okay just, just play ball.

23:51.826 --> 23:54.595
Do what they ask and if
you're lucky you'll get by.

23:55.696 --> 23:57.064
I need to find
out who they are.

23:57.098 --> 23:58.733
Who do they work for?

23:58.766 --> 24:01.702
Jesus Christ, Kinji, just
don't look into this all right?

24:01.736 --> 24:02.803
Stay out of it, okay?

24:04.171 --> 24:07.775
The deeper you dig, the
nastier it gets, trust me.

24:08.843 --> 24:11.613
They all answer to someone who
runs things from underground.

24:11.647 --> 24:14.549
I don't know his name, but
they all answer to him.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.853
The Italians, the Irish,
the Russians, everybody.

24:19.087 --> 24:20.856
He's bad news, Kinji.

24:22.524 --> 24:24.793
Think about your family,
don't do something stupid.

24:27.829 --> 24:29.798
No.

24:29.831 --> 24:31.600
No, I have to do something.

24:31.633 --> 24:32.801
I can't let them do
this to me or my.

24:32.834 --> 24:34.036
Kinji you could get.

24:34.069 --> 24:36.438
Just be patient Frank.

24:37.573 --> 24:39.008
I'm gonna fix this,
for both of us.

24:48.697 --> 24:52.910
Yasuyuki!
You're early!

24:52.951 --> 24:56.079
- The restaurant isn't open yet...
- No problem, Kinji.

24:56.121 --> 25:01.793
I was just passing by and thought
I would come to see you.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.635
Sorry to keep you waiting.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.804
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.683
How are things with you?

25:16.725 --> 25:19.770
They are well, thank you.

25:19.811 --> 25:23.649
Masaki is really enjoying his new school.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.442
That's great to hear.

25:25.484 --> 25:29.780
Maybe we can get our sons together again soon?

25:29.821 --> 25:34.826
I'm sure Masaki would like that.

25:36.495 --> 25:39.498
What about you? How's business going?

25:39.540 --> 25:42.251
The restaurant seems to be doing very well.

25:42.292 --> 25:47.589
Yes, it's going surprisingly well, thank you.

25:48.757 --> 25:50.133
But...

25:50.175 --> 25:56.014
But? Has something happened?

25:56.056 --> 26:00.811
I'm sure it's nothing, but...

26:00.853 --> 26:05.858
we had some trouble with a few Russian men.

26:05.899 --> 26:10.529
Yes, I saw them come in.
What did they want?

26:10.571 --> 26:12.865
Oh it's nothing really.

26:15.576 --> 26:18.120
I know it's not my business,

26:18.161 --> 26:23.125
but please let me know if there's anything I can help with.

26:23.166 --> 26:28.297
When the Russians came,
they must have wanted something?

26:28.338 --> 26:30.465
It was nothing really.

26:32.759 --> 26:37.139
I understand how important this restaurant is to you.

26:37.181 --> 26:42.102
I represent many businesses.

26:42.144 --> 26:48.358
So I know how the Russians operate in London.

26:50.152 --> 26:52.154
I see.

26:52.946 --> 26:58.202
You're a lawyer?

26:58.243 --> 27:01.413
Yes, I am.

27:03.832 --> 27:06.168
I see.

27:07.044 --> 27:11.840
I guess I'm still learning
how things operate in London.

27:11.882 --> 27:17.221
Would you be willing to help me in some way
with the restaurant?

27:18.096 --> 27:21.266
Of course.

27:21.683 --> 27:24.728
You can reach me anytime...

27:24.770 --> 27:27.272
and tell me how you think I can help.

27:27.314 --> 27:33.320
Thank you. I appreciate that.
But, not here.

27:33.362 --> 27:37.783
- My wife would start to worry if she heard us talk.
- That's okay.

27:37.824 --> 27:44.122
Just let me know where and when you want to talk.
I'll be there.

27:45.666 --> 27:49.419
My family means everything.

27:50.337 --> 27:59.763
Family is important.
You must always protect them first.

28:02.432 --> 28:04.852
Thank you.

28:06.103 --> 28:12.025
I must get back to preparing for lunch.
You are welcome to stay as long as you need.

28:32.184 --> 28:33.985
The way things
work around here,

28:34.019 --> 28:37.056
is when I ask for
something, I get it.

28:37.089 --> 28:38.257
Yeah?

28:38.291 --> 28:41.827
So when I ask for this very,
very important information,

28:41.861 --> 28:43.963
and you tell me it's
gonna be difficult,

28:43.996 --> 28:46.966
makes me wonder how fucking
useless you really are, huh?

28:48.334 --> 28:49.969
I don't want to
hear any of this,

28:50.002 --> 28:52.138
it's gonna be difficult,
bullshit, just get it done.

28:53.039 --> 28:56.209
I wanna hear solutions,
not fucking problems.

28:57.511 --> 28:59.146
Yeah?

28:59.179 --> 29:01.415
Or do I need to find someone
else to do the job, huh?

29:02.449 --> 29:04.318
- No.
- No.

29:04.351 --> 29:06.053
Not at all Mr Dyer,

29:06.086 --> 29:08.355
we're just talking
about the highest levels

29:08.388 --> 29:10.824
of government security and data.

29:10.857 --> 29:13.227
It, it's highly classified.

29:13.260 --> 29:15.829
It will take us just a
bit more time to obtain.

29:16.863 --> 29:17.464
I'm expecting more...

29:17.498 --> 29:18.432
Hang on there.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.299
Time?

29:20.501 --> 29:22.069
You want more fucking time?

29:23.539 --> 29:24.339
He wants more time.

29:25.206 --> 29:27.208
Fucking time?

29:27.242 --> 29:30.445
Time, is something you
don't have my son, yeah!

29:32.347 --> 29:34.550
Time, is always against us.

29:34.583 --> 29:36.251
So if there's one thing

29:36.284 --> 29:39.555
in this beautifully fucked
up world you don't have,

29:39.588 --> 29:40.421
it's time.

29:42.323 --> 29:43.791
Now do you understand the words

29:43.825 --> 29:44.959
that are coming out of my mouth?

29:44.993 --> 29:47.229
Or am I speaking
double fucking Dutch?

29:48.565 --> 29:49.398
Huh?

29:53.435 --> 29:55.070
Yes, yes Mr Dyer.

29:55.104 --> 29:56.305
We understand completely.

29:58.474 --> 30:00.009
Good.

30:00.042 --> 30:01.343
Now we're getting somewhere.

30:02.579 --> 30:05.582
We'll have everything
to you by tomorrow.

30:05.615 --> 30:07.383
I want it by the
end of tomorrow.

30:08.350 --> 30:10.887
And if I don't have it by then,

30:10.920 --> 30:12.422
let's just say your time's up.

30:14.024 --> 30:15.825
Now get the fuck out of my club!

30:26.269 --> 30:27.170
Set up a meet with the Russians.

30:27.203 --> 30:30.106
Sure boss,
where do you want it?

30:30.140 --> 30:31.207
Where the fuck do you think?

30:31.241 --> 30:32.075
Here, you idiot.

30:34.646 --> 30:36.515
No no, my love.

30:36.548 --> 30:38.550
Sakura, Sakura,

30:38.583 --> 30:40.384
You don't have to worry anymore.

30:41.152 --> 30:43.321
No I took care, they
won't be coming back.

30:46.658 --> 30:48.893
No, I know who they
work for and they.

30:48.926 --> 30:50.361
Hold on, I'm gonna
call you back, okay?

31:03.442 --> 31:05.578
Daddy, daddy, look
what I made today.

31:05.611 --> 31:07.012
Hey hey Jumpei.

31:08.347 --> 31:09.147
You have a good day?

31:09.181 --> 31:09.981
Yeah.

31:10.015 --> 31:11.350
Wow, what is this?

31:11.383 --> 31:13.085
I made it all by myself.

31:13.118 --> 31:14.953
I spent my whole break time.

31:14.986 --> 31:15.588
Is this for me?

31:15.621 --> 31:17.356
Yeah.

31:17.389 --> 31:18.957
Wow, I love it.

31:18.990 --> 31:20.593
Let's find a good place
for this in the restaurant.

31:20.626 --> 31:21.527
Yeah.

31:21.561 --> 31:22.428
Come on, let's go home.

31:42.014 --> 31:43.484
All right, darling?

31:43.517 --> 31:46.186
Yeah I'm fine baby, but
you seem a little tense.

31:46.855 --> 31:48.956
Is there anything I can do?

31:48.989 --> 31:52.226
Where those men
making you angry?

31:52.259 --> 31:54.461
Well those men, Vanessa,
are gonna change everything.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.363
Ooh, everything?

31:56.397 --> 31:57.297
Everything.

31:57.331 --> 31:58.065
I like the sound of that.

31:59.567 --> 32:00.367
Dylan.

32:01.569 --> 32:03.103
Go bring the car
out front, mate.

32:03.137 --> 32:05.272
We're gonna head out, yeah?

32:05.305 --> 32:07.609
Sorry darling, I've got to go.

32:11.547 --> 32:13.415
Yes, is everything okay?

32:13.448 --> 32:14.416
Everything okay dad?

32:14.449 --> 32:15.651
Yes, everything's fine.

32:15.684 --> 32:18.186
Well the kitchen needs you,
the restaurant's filling up.

32:18.219 --> 32:21.590
Okay, I'll be there in
minute, just handle it for now.

32:23.235 --> 32:26.363
Sorry, it was Mio.

32:26.405 --> 32:30.117
I'm worried they are going to do something.

32:30.158 --> 32:35.205
Yasuyuki, I really need your help.

32:35.247 --> 32:38.083
I can't risk anything happening to my family.

32:38.125 --> 32:41.253
I think it might be a good idea for you
to join us for dinner

32:41.295 --> 32:46.925
and get to know my family.

32:47.885 --> 32:51.180
Would you do that Yasuyuki?

32:51.221 --> 32:54.183
Great, I will send you our address.

32:54.224 --> 32:56.518
See you soon.

33:08.655 --> 33:13.160
See you boss, thanks for tonight.

33:13.202 --> 33:16.788
I'll be back in next week.
I'm off on holiday tomorrow.

33:16.830 --> 33:20.292
- Where are you off to again?
- Mexico, boss. Family re-union.

33:20.334 --> 33:24.004
Oh that's right, Mexico.
Well enjoy the Tequilas!

33:24.046 --> 33:27.341
Haha will do. Thanks boss.

33:27.382 --> 33:28.884
Thanks!

33:48.180 --> 33:49.616
Hello, Mr Kinji.

33:49.649 --> 33:51.651
So nice of you to
finally arrive, huh.

33:53.418 --> 33:56.321
Just getting friendly and
acquainted with young Timmy here,

33:56.355 --> 33:58.625
and his plans for Mexico.

33:58.658 --> 34:01.159
Such a fantastic destination.

34:01.193 --> 34:03.763
Would be a terrible shame if
he was never to see his friend.

34:03.796 --> 34:06.566
No, leave him out of this,
he has nothing to do with it.

34:06.599 --> 34:07.767
Let him go.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.301
He is our esteemed colleague,

34:09.334 --> 34:11.672
surely has everything
to do with our business.

34:11.705 --> 34:14.274
Look, I have your
money, just let him go

34:14.307 --> 34:15.543
and we can settle this.

34:17.377 --> 34:18.512
Why didn't you say so?

34:24.150 --> 34:27.086
Enjoy the margarita's friend.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.222
And be careful of the women,
they are very, very nasty.

34:34.361 --> 34:36.096
Where were we, oh yes.

34:36.130 --> 34:37.464
Go get my money.

34:40.769 --> 34:41.670
Fucking shit hole.

34:46.140 --> 34:46.741
What's this?

34:50.444 --> 34:51.813
Here, take it.

34:56.150 --> 34:57.519
Wasn't so hard, was it?

34:59.354 --> 35:01.389
But if I get one more sniff

35:01.423 --> 35:04.159
that you are trying
to avoid our business

35:04.192 --> 35:07.496
it will not be the neck
of Timmy under my arm,

35:07.530 --> 35:11.500
it will be the neck of
your little boy, Jumpei.

35:12.434 --> 35:13.435
It will be a terrible...

35:13.468 --> 35:14.302
Stop!

35:15.905 --> 35:18.239
Leave my family out of
this, I will pay you.

35:18.273 --> 35:20.509
Just leave my family alone.

35:22.913 --> 35:25.414
Good, it appears we
are getting somewhere.

35:27.951 --> 35:30.520
See you next month
my good friend.

35:47.689 --> 35:50.442
Listen up. We must find him no matter what.

35:50.484 --> 35:52.986
- This is your mission. Understood?
- Yes, sir.

35:53.362 --> 35:55.489
- Boss.
- What is it?

35:55.531 --> 35:58.325
It's for you, boss.

35:58.742 --> 36:01.954
Yes, hello, what is it?

36:04.414 --> 36:10.546
Everybody out. Now!

36:13.674 --> 36:18.345
You've found him?
Where is he? London!?

36:19.930 --> 36:24.017
Which restaurant?

36:24.059 --> 36:27.688
I will send Kazuki to assist you.

36:27.729 --> 36:32.025
Make sure you return what is ours,
no matter what.

36:34.152 --> 36:38.323
Well done, you should be proud.

36:44.162 --> 36:48.458
Prepare Kazuki. Send him to London immediately.

36:48.500 --> 36:52.254
Make sure he brings the device back.

36:52.296 --> 36:56.425
We have to finally put an end to this.

36:56.466 --> 37:01.555
- Kinji Suzuki must die.
- Understood.

37:09.396 --> 37:11.574
We've found him.

37:14.943 --> 37:18.447
Eat some vegetables too.

37:18.488 --> 37:21.366
You've really come a long way
with your cooking, Mio.

37:21.408 --> 37:23.285
Thanks for prearing dinner tonight.

37:23.327 --> 37:26.246
You haven't finished it yet, Mum!

37:26.288 --> 37:29.208
Besides, I've learned from the best,
haven't I, Dad?

37:29.249 --> 37:35.756
I'm not sure your father would consider
himself the best...

37:35.797 --> 37:39.343
Well, I think both of your cooking is delicious.

37:39.384 --> 37:46.975
I can definitely see you taking over
from your Dad one day.

37:49.728 --> 37:52.940
Mio, can you answer the door?

37:55.776 --> 37:59.112
- Would you like some?
- Thank you.

37:59.154 --> 38:04.493
Kinji?

38:05.118 --> 38:07.371
Cheers...

38:08.497 --> 38:10.541
Are you eating vegetables?

38:14.002 --> 38:16.296
- Hey everyone!
- Hello!

38:16.338 --> 38:17.631
Akiho's here.

38:17.673 --> 38:21.385
Did you cook this Mio?
Looks amazing!

38:21.426 --> 38:23.220
- Please join us.
- Thank you.

38:23.262 --> 38:27.182
Have some food.
Nice to see you.

38:28.308 --> 38:31.520
- How are your parents?
- They are fine.

38:31.562 --> 38:36.441
When did we see them last? 6 months ago?

38:38.360 --> 38:40.279
- I heard you moved?
- Yes, we have.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.239
- Where to?
- Just nearby.

38:42.281 --> 38:46.451
Really?
How near? Walking distance?

38:46.493 --> 38:47.828
About 10 minutes.

38:47.870 --> 38:50.330
Really? You should come by more.

38:50.372 --> 38:55.127
Mio didn't tell us.

38:57.045 --> 39:00.090
Mio, who's that man?

39:00.132 --> 39:04.303
Dad's new friend.
He often comes to the restaurant.

39:04.344 --> 39:08.640
Don't you think he's handsome?

39:08.682 --> 39:12.060
- Didn't know you like older men.
- Not like that. But he's very nice.

39:12.102 --> 39:15.814
- Who made this miso soup?
- Mio. She cooked it all.

39:15.856 --> 39:17.107
Except for the Nori seaweed...

39:17.149 --> 39:19.193
Yeah, the seaweed and the pickles.

39:19.234 --> 39:21.069
Isn't Mio's cooking great?

39:21.111 --> 39:23.113
You should ask her to cook again.

39:23.155 --> 39:25.449
Right, Mio?

39:27.409 --> 39:31.205
So Yakuyuki, tell us more about your work.

39:31.246 --> 39:36.710
Kinji tells me you're a lawyer?
How long have you been doing that?

39:36.752 --> 39:38.170
Let me think...

39:38.212 --> 39:42.424
Well I worked in this field for many years
back in Japan.

39:42.466 --> 39:45.511
So maybe around 15-20 years.

39:45.552 --> 39:51.266
Oh wow, you must be very experienced then.

39:53.852 --> 40:01.610
Yasuyuki is going to help our family business.
Make sure everything's in order for us.

40:01.652 --> 40:05.948
Really? Well we must be in very safe hands then.

40:08.116 --> 40:13.539
- Would you like some more?
- Thank you. I feel drunk now.

40:19.721 --> 40:20.856
Is everything okay?

40:20.889 --> 40:21.723
Hey!

40:21.757 --> 40:23.457
Hey, yeah.

40:23.491 --> 40:24.526
Yeah, everything's fine.

40:24.559 --> 40:25.761
Um, can I help?

40:25.794 --> 40:29.798
No, I'm just, last one here.

40:29.831 --> 40:30.732
- Oh.
- All done.

40:34.170 --> 40:36.005
Thanks, my love.

40:36.039 --> 40:38.541
It was a really nice dinner
with Yasuyuki-san tonight,

40:38.574 --> 40:39.609
wasn't it?

40:39.642 --> 40:41.577
Yeah, he liked Mio's fish.

40:42.912 --> 40:44.847
He seems to be
a very nice man.

40:45.815 --> 40:46.816
Yes, he is.

40:48.685 --> 40:50.153
I'm really glad you
have sorted out those men

40:50.186 --> 40:52.055
who came to the
restaurant last month.

40:52.088 --> 40:53.488
I was really worried that.

40:53.523 --> 40:56.059
You don't need
to worry, Sakura.

40:56.092 --> 41:00.496
I will always make sure
you're safe, before anything.

41:01.565 --> 41:03.667
Protecting you and the
kids is all I care about.

41:05.135 --> 41:09.006
You know this restaurant,
it's just a business.

41:09.039 --> 41:10.774
We can change it
anytime we want to.

41:12.676 --> 41:15.612
Well hopefully we don't have
to change too many more times.

41:16.547 --> 41:17.848
I'm beginning to like London.

41:18.682 --> 41:19.650
Oh?

41:19.683 --> 41:20.284
Mm-hm.

41:20.317 --> 41:21.151
Me too.

41:23.855 --> 41:24.990
I'm gonna go and
check on the kids.

41:25.023 --> 41:26.558
Okay.

41:26.591 --> 41:27.892
I'll see you soon.

42:33.126 --> 42:35.797
Welcome to the Madarin,
may I take your name?

42:37.932 --> 42:39.333
Yes yes, of course.

42:40.811 --> 42:43.105
Leave it!

42:43.838 --> 42:45.940
I will take this.

42:51.780 --> 42:55.492
- Yasuyuki! So good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

42:55.534 --> 42:59.329
- I wanted to thank you for a lovely dinner.
- That's very sweet.

42:59.371 --> 43:03.667
Your cooking was delicious, Mio.

43:03.709 --> 43:07.379
Thank you, Yasuyuki.
Such beautiful flowers!

43:07.421 --> 43:12.009
It was so lovely to have you over,
you must join us again.

43:12.050 --> 43:13.886
It would be my pleasure.

43:13.927 --> 43:17.931
- Maybe Junpei can cook next time!
- Maybe!

43:17.973 --> 43:20.976
Kinji should be here soon
if you wanted to say hello?

43:21.018 --> 43:24.271
That's okay, I have a few meetings to get to.

43:24.313 --> 43:26.982
Send him my regards. See you again soon.

43:27.024 --> 43:29.276
Thank you, I will do.

43:29.318 --> 43:32.321
We'll look forward to seeing you soon.

43:32.362 --> 43:35.991
- Thank you again for the flowers!
- You're welcome.

43:36.033 --> 43:38.160
Bye.

43:42.456 --> 43:44.082
- Look.
- They're beautiful.

43:44.124 --> 43:47.336
Why do you always get the flowers!

43:47.377 --> 43:50.297
I can't help being the best chef
in the family, Mum.

43:50.339 --> 43:52.758
Good for you.

44:28.413 --> 44:31.349
Well well well,
you must be Kazuki.

44:34.120 --> 44:37.056
Normally I'd say I've heard a
lot about ya, but I haven't.

44:37.089 --> 44:38.224
Please, sit down.

44:42.428 --> 44:43.229
Girls.

44:44.330 --> 44:45.164
No.

44:48.167 --> 44:49.202
Fuckin' hell, looks
like we're straight

44:49.235 --> 44:50.403
down to business, boys.

44:52.972 --> 44:56.242
You know I've been working
this city for 15 years.

44:56.275 --> 44:59.112
I never come across a Jap
as highly feared as you.

44:59.947 --> 45:02.182
See that's what I
love about this town.

45:02.216 --> 45:04.384
You never know who's
around the corner, do ya?

45:04.418 --> 45:05.852
Never ceases to...

45:05.886 --> 45:08.155
I didn't come here to
talk about your history,

45:08.188 --> 45:11.291
I came here to talk about
a man that I need to find.

45:11.325 --> 45:14.127
And I understand you are the
person to find such people.

45:16.797 --> 45:19.032
I'm sorry, is this your club?

45:21.201 --> 45:22.103
Huh?

45:22.136 --> 45:23.238
Is this your fucking city?

45:24.205 --> 45:25.873
Because I'm beginning to
feel like I'm in Japan

45:25.907 --> 45:27.976
or some other stupid
fucking country,

45:28.009 --> 45:30.044
where people don't
know who the fuck I am!

45:30.078 --> 45:31.179
Do you know who the fuck I am?

45:31.212 --> 45:32.146
Yes, I know.

45:33.281 --> 45:35.450
You're the person who's
gonna find me, Kinji Suzuki.

45:43.992 --> 45:44.826
Half now.

45:45.995 --> 45:48.130
Half after we're getting him.

45:48.163 --> 45:49.298
Look at this, fuckin' hell.

45:49.331 --> 45:51.166
At least you put your money
where your mouth is, mate.

45:57.039 --> 46:00.276
What's so special about this
Kinji Suzuji anyway, huh?

46:00.309 --> 46:01.243
What kind of name is that?

46:02.978 --> 46:05.981
What makes him special
is my business, not yours.

46:06.015 --> 46:07.449
You just need to
find him for me.

46:08.917 --> 46:09.553
Now.

46:12.155 --> 46:14.157
You come into my town,

46:14.190 --> 46:16.159
you want me to
clean up your mess.

46:17.327 --> 46:19.296
You say it's not my
fucking business.

46:20.096 --> 46:22.432
Who the fuck do you
think you are, huh?

46:24.901 --> 46:26.303
Throw him the fuck out, now.

46:40.251 --> 46:42.286
I came here
looking for answers,

46:42.320 --> 46:44.488
but all you've done
is show me problems.

46:45.489 --> 46:46.924
I was told you are the person

46:46.957 --> 46:49.193
who could find me
anyone in London.

46:49.226 --> 46:51.195
And supposedly run things here.

46:52.363 --> 46:56.000
Now, can you find
this man for me,

46:56.967 --> 47:00.372
or am I gonna have to
tear this city apart

47:00.405 --> 47:01.973
until I find him myself?

47:03.408 --> 47:06.345
Be careful who you're
fucking talking to, yeah?

47:08.113 --> 47:09.414
I'll find this man for ya,

47:10.382 --> 47:13.985
but once I do, if I
don't like what I see,

47:14.019 --> 47:16.154
I'll kill him my fucking self.

47:16.188 --> 47:17.557
And I'll send you
both back in a box

47:17.590 --> 47:19.257
to where you belong, yeah?

47:19.291 --> 47:21.427
I will be hearing
for more then.

47:25.632 --> 47:29.068
Well, fucking
get up you morons.

47:29.102 --> 47:31.971
What the fuck am I paying
for you stupid idiots?

47:32.004 --> 47:33.373
Just stand there like a
bunch of fucking lemons.

47:33.406 --> 47:36.275
Get out there and find him
and bring him back here now.

47:36.309 --> 47:37.143
Yes boss.

47:37.176 --> 47:42.148
Right then, come
on lads, let's go.

48:40.128 --> 48:43.757
Yes, I'm making progress.

48:43.799 --> 48:47.761
However the people I'm working with
over here are useless.

48:47.803 --> 48:54.268
But rest assured, if they don't find him then I will.

48:54.309 --> 48:56.478
Yes.

48:56.520 --> 49:01.400
I will update you at the end of each day until I do.

49:07.781 --> 49:12.536
- Kinji.
- Yasuyuki. Thanks for meeting me.

49:12.828 --> 49:17.040
I wasn't expecting your call so soon.
You sounded worried.

49:17.082 --> 49:20.002
Everything okay? You know I have an office...

49:20.043 --> 49:22.546
No, not in your office.

49:22.588 --> 49:26.675
I don't want anyone to know about this,
especially my family.

49:26.717 --> 49:31.555
Anyway, you said you could help?

49:31.597 --> 49:37.436
Of course, I can always help professionally.

49:37.477 --> 49:41.106
I don't think the law's going to help me.

49:41.148 --> 49:45.903
These men won't stop until they've bled my restaurant dry.

49:45.944 --> 49:50.115
I can't let them do this to my family.

49:50.157 --> 49:53.577
- I had to do something.
- Don't worry.

49:53.619 --> 49:57.497
I have contacts in many different areas.
I can help you.

50:02.461 --> 50:05.088
I need you to get me something.

50:08.759 --> 50:10.594
Okay.

50:10.636 --> 50:14.932
- Anything you need.
- Thank you.

50:18.646 --> 50:20.146
Frank!

50:20.179 --> 50:20.814
Oh Frank.

50:22.115 --> 50:23.817
Where the fuck are you?

50:25.753 --> 50:27.086
Oh shit.

50:27.120 --> 50:29.255
What are you
running for, Franky?

50:29.289 --> 50:31.291
Hello gorgeous, hello.

50:32.525 --> 50:34.461
What have you done, aye Frank?

50:34.495 --> 50:36.430
Nothing, nothing, I just,
look I got no money okay.

50:36.463 --> 50:37.866
I, I, I got nothing left.

50:37.899 --> 50:40.569
Everyone's bled me
dry, I got nothing.

50:40.602 --> 50:41.803
You better not be
fucking lying to me.

50:41.836 --> 50:43.170
I'm not.

50:43.203 --> 50:44.104
Bye, Frank.

50:45.306 --> 50:46.741
We don't need for
the money anyway.

50:47.642 --> 50:49.109
Better give us someone,

50:49.143 --> 50:51.378
some chat by the
name of Kinji Suzuki.

50:52.547 --> 50:53.447
Apparently he has a restaurant

50:53.480 --> 50:55.115
round these neck of the woods.

50:55.149 --> 50:57.152
Know anything about him?

50:57.185 --> 50:58.486
Name doesn't ring a bell.

50:59.922 --> 51:01.489
You fucking.

51:01.523 --> 51:03.158
Do me a favor will ya,

51:03.191 --> 51:05.661
we know you know every
fucker in this business.

51:05.695 --> 51:09.097
Now tell us where he is and
we'll make it worth your while.

51:10.498 --> 51:11.601
What?

51:11.634 --> 51:12.868
You heard me.

51:14.302 --> 51:15.303
Really?

51:15.337 --> 51:17.840
What would you like, Frank?

51:17.873 --> 51:19.075
Um, well if you could make it

51:19.107 --> 51:22.813
so the Russians never set foot
in here that would be nice.

51:22.846 --> 51:23.780
All right, done.

51:24.748 --> 51:25.849
Okay good.

51:25.882 --> 51:26.683
Now where's the fucking Jap?

51:26.717 --> 51:28.752
I don't know, I
don't know, but.

51:28.785 --> 51:30.319
Ask the Russians,
they'll know him okay.

51:30.353 --> 51:32.188
They run every
restaurant, they'll know.

51:32.221 --> 51:33.690
The Russians.

51:33.724 --> 51:34.825
You better not be
fucking lying to me, Frank.

51:34.858 --> 51:37.460
I'm not, I'm not.

51:37.493 --> 51:39.462
All right, but you know what?

51:40.529 --> 51:42.866
It's about time we paid those
dirty Russians a visit anyway.

51:42.899 --> 51:44.835
Yeah, you guys can take them.

51:44.868 --> 51:46.537
You call us if you
hear anything, all right?

51:46.571 --> 51:48.640
Sure sure, same
same, cell, mobile?

51:50.808 --> 51:51.809
Shut up.

51:51.843 --> 51:52.677
Okay.

51:53.611 --> 51:56.748
And Frank, so this
fucking restaurant here,

51:56.781 --> 51:58.583
it's a shit hole.

51:58.616 --> 51:59.684
Maybe change the
menu or something.

51:59.717 --> 52:00.551
Sure.

52:01.719 --> 52:03.353
All right George,
come on, let's go.

52:07.659 --> 52:10.228
Stop serving those bacon
triple cheeseburgers.

52:11.697 --> 52:13.932
I can't fucking help myself
and they're making me fat!

52:19.437 --> 52:21.239
All right, just gotta
call the boss quick then.

52:27.913 --> 52:28.914
Hello, boss?

52:29.948 --> 52:31.850
Yeah, apparently the
Russians know where he is.

52:32.885 --> 52:33.920
Yeah.

52:35.354 --> 52:36.956
So what, you want me to
set up a meet, or what?

52:38.257 --> 52:39.893
Yeah all right.

52:39.926 --> 52:42.361
All right I'm on it.

52:42.394 --> 52:44.329
Fuck me Georgie boy,

52:44.363 --> 52:46.633
this could get very ugly
mate, very ugly indeed.

52:46.666 --> 52:48.835
Fucking hate the Russians.

52:48.868 --> 52:51.470
Yeah me too, George, me too.

52:51.503 --> 52:55.975
Eh, can't we get a little
massage before we head back?

52:56.009 --> 52:57.178
Massage?

52:57.210 --> 52:58.979
Yeah, one of those Thai
one's, better than the others.

52:59.013 --> 53:00.014
You having a fucking laugh?

53:00.047 --> 53:00.948
No.

53:00.981 --> 53:01.816
All right, just a quick one.

53:01.849 --> 53:03.818
Huh, I'm always quick.

53:24.806 --> 53:28.043
Oh!

53:28.076 --> 53:29.711
Fuck!

53:29.745 --> 53:30.879
What do I owe the pleasure
of that slap, darling?

53:30.912 --> 53:34.515
I told you to get rid of
those whores from our club.

53:34.549 --> 53:37.418
All right Vanessa, but this
is a night club, isn't it?

53:37.451 --> 53:38.887
Guess you haven't realized,
sometimes that means

53:38.920 --> 53:41.056
having chicks around,
keeping customers happy.

53:41.089 --> 53:42.557
Yeah, I get that Vincent,

53:42.591 --> 53:44.025
but right now we
have no customers

53:44.059 --> 53:46.528
and it's the middle
of the fucking day.

53:46.562 --> 53:48.064
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

53:48.097 --> 53:48.998
I beg to differ, darling.

53:49.031 --> 53:50.967
I consider myself a
customer right now,

53:51.000 --> 53:52.034
wouldn't you guys?

53:52.068 --> 53:52.869
Yeah, me too!

53:55.537 --> 53:57.774
Shut up, Dylan, all right?

53:57.807 --> 54:00.308
Sorry darling, how
could I be so rude.

54:00.342 --> 54:02.310
All right girls, piss off.

54:35.146 --> 54:35.980
Kinji?

54:37.148 --> 54:39.349
Hey, hey my love.

54:39.383 --> 54:40.852
Is everything all right?

54:40.885 --> 54:42.386
Yeah, yeah.

54:43.087 --> 54:44.622
Everything is fine.

54:44.656 --> 54:48.927
Just another late shift
at the restaurant.

54:48.960 --> 54:49.961
You're wet.

54:52.063 --> 54:52.897
It's raining.

54:54.098 --> 54:56.500
Hm, you didn't
take the trolley?

54:56.533 --> 54:57.870
I never take the trolley.

55:02.975 --> 55:07.680
You know, you should take
some of your own advice

55:07.713 --> 55:09.347
and have a few days off.

55:11.550 --> 55:15.120
Maybe we can go away for
the weekend, without kids.

55:17.455 --> 55:18.090
Hm?

55:19.692 --> 55:20.759
Maybe we can.

55:22.428 --> 55:24.698
That sounds like a,
yeah that sounds like a,

55:24.731 --> 55:26.432
that sounds like a good idea.

55:26.465 --> 55:29.102
Maybe even more if we need to.

55:30.904 --> 55:32.772
Now we're talking.

55:33.907 --> 55:38.578
Um, maybe we can
go up to the lakes.

55:40.680 --> 55:41.848
I knew you'd say that.

55:43.817 --> 55:44.886
That does sound nice.

55:46.519 --> 55:47.822
Let's figure out a time

55:47.855 --> 55:49.790
we can close the
restaurant for a few weeks.

55:59.200 --> 56:01.434
Come up to bed.

56:01.468 --> 56:02.435
I will soon.

56:05.172 --> 56:06.007
Okay.

56:08.810 --> 56:09.611
Love you.

56:09.645 --> 56:10.545
Love you too.

56:14.917 --> 56:16.818
Don't stay up too late.

56:35.838 --> 56:36.639
All right, come on lads.

56:36.673 --> 56:37.941
Let's make this quick.

56:39.676 --> 56:40.877
I fucking hate the Russians.

56:40.910 --> 56:41.978
Sounds good, boss.

56:42.812 --> 56:44.580
Fucking hate them too.

56:44.614 --> 56:46.215
Don't worry boss,
we got you covered.

56:46.249 --> 56:47.083
Good.

56:49.285 --> 56:51.621
We'll wait for, Vincente the
villain, he's coming shortly.

56:52.288 --> 56:53.589
Practice our English.

56:53.623 --> 56:54.891
I hate the fucking English.

56:58.662 --> 56:59.830
Vincent!

56:59.863 --> 57:01.265
How nice of you to pop in.

57:02.866 --> 57:04.868
What's goin' on in here, lads?

57:04.902 --> 57:07.037
Looks like some rich
boy's fucking wedding.

57:08.205 --> 57:09.206
Who's the lucky man?

57:10.140 --> 57:12.109
Has Ivan finally tied
the knot, have ya?

57:12.142 --> 57:14.712
Ya fuck, get your
fucking ear on, mate.

57:15.579 --> 57:16.780
What can we do for you?

57:16.814 --> 57:18.849
Please, take a seat.

57:21.586 --> 57:26.591
All right, I'll tell you
what you can fucking do for us.

57:27.258 --> 57:28.693
You can start by telling us

57:28.727 --> 57:30.762
where this Kinji fucking
Suzuki's hold up, yeah?

57:31.763 --> 57:34.299
Some fucking Yakuza mob
just flew in from Japan

57:34.332 --> 57:37.035
and they want me to find him.

57:37.068 --> 57:39.270
So I need to know where he is

57:39.304 --> 57:43.108
and what makes him so
fucking valuable, yeah?

57:44.009 --> 57:44.844
Now,

57:46.812 --> 57:48.714
do you boys know
anything or what?

57:49.815 --> 57:54.653
If we do, what
is in it for us?

57:57.623 --> 57:59.725
What's in it for you?

57:59.759 --> 58:01.560
I'll tell you what's
in it for you, mate.

58:01.594 --> 58:02.695
I'll let you keep extorting

58:02.728 --> 58:04.597
all my fucking
restaurants in London,

58:04.630 --> 58:06.198
that's what's in it for you.

58:07.166 --> 58:11.772
Listen Vincent, yes
we have an arrangement.

58:11.805 --> 58:14.708
You have the clubs, we
have the restaurants.

58:14.741 --> 58:18.612
But I am not in
business with you.

58:18.645 --> 58:20.147
Hang on a minute.

58:22.015 --> 58:24.117
Hang on a fucking minute.

58:25.719 --> 58:28.321
We let you come here and
set up shop in London, yeah?

58:29.723 --> 58:31.758
And you say it's not
my fucking business?

58:31.792 --> 58:34.796
Your business is my
fucking business,

58:34.829 --> 58:36.564
ya bunch of fucking hooligans.

58:38.833 --> 58:39.934
Relax, relax.

58:39.967 --> 58:42.670
We can handle this like adults.

58:46.174 --> 58:48.709
Sit the fuck down
you beautiful man.

58:48.743 --> 58:49.877
It's okay, Ivan, sit.

58:56.985 --> 58:58.587
Vincent, it's very simple.

59:00.222 --> 59:02.825
If we give you this information,

59:02.858 --> 59:04.993
we want something out of it.

59:07.863 --> 59:08.864
All right.

59:09.798 --> 59:10.799
Fair is fair, yeah?

59:13.068 --> 59:16.839
How bout a 100 grand?

59:16.872 --> 59:18.974
There well, that
wasn't so hard, was it?

59:20.409 --> 59:23.746
We'll take 100 now, and
100 when you get the boy.

59:28.852 --> 59:30.220
Deal.

59:30.253 --> 59:31.688
Done.

59:31.721 --> 59:35.959
Now, where the fuck is he?

59:35.992 --> 59:37.994
Oh let me try and remember.

59:39.195 --> 59:43.066
He is in a little
Japanese restaurant

59:43.099 --> 59:46.403
on the corner of Beale
street and Shaft avenue.

59:48.806 --> 59:51.275
And he has a very,
very pretty wife.

59:53.277 --> 59:54.712
Nice.

59:54.745 --> 59:55.913
But be very careful,

59:57.748 --> 59:58.749
she bites.

1:00:06.423 --> 1:00:07.258
Now,

1:00:11.196 --> 1:00:12.898
I'm afraid I must
ask you to leave.

1:00:12.931 --> 1:00:16.268
We have a very important
event here today,

1:00:16.301 --> 1:00:18.103
to which you are not invited.

1:00:21.439 --> 1:00:23.275
All right, whatever.

1:00:24.376 --> 1:00:26.444
Pleasure doing
business, as always.

1:00:28.947 --> 1:00:30.749
Yeah, whatever.

1:00:30.782 --> 1:00:31.750
See ya later lads.

1:00:32.952 --> 1:00:33.953
Ya fuck.

1:00:33.986 --> 1:00:35.154
Thanks for the drink.

1:00:36.222 --> 1:00:37.890
Cheers fuckers.

1:00:37.924 --> 1:00:38.891
Come on lads.

1:00:38.925 --> 1:00:40.293
Let's go find this fucking Jap.

1:00:44.530 --> 1:00:46.065
Fuckers of mothers.

1:01:13.493 --> 1:01:14.795
You must be the wife.

1:01:15.996 --> 1:01:17.030
Not bad for a Jap.

1:01:18.232 --> 1:01:20.067
Well I'm more of
a Thai man myself.

1:01:23.438 --> 1:01:24.505
Can I help?

1:01:24.539 --> 1:01:25.940
Most certainly can, love.

1:01:25.974 --> 1:01:28.009
You can start by
telling everyone here

1:01:28.042 --> 1:01:29.877
to get the fuck out of
the restaurant, now!

1:01:29.911 --> 1:01:31.179
Everybody out!

1:01:31.212 --> 1:01:32.046
Get out!

1:01:36.084 --> 1:01:37.285
What are you doing?

1:01:37.318 --> 1:01:39.287
I told your people I would pay.

1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:40.955
Why are you here again?

1:01:40.989 --> 1:01:44.025
Those people you're
referring to, mate,

1:01:44.058 --> 1:01:46.161
work for me, yeah?

1:01:46.862 --> 1:01:50.532
Everyone in this fucking
city works for me.

1:01:50.567 --> 1:01:52.501
Whether they're
Russian, or Jewish,

1:01:52.534 --> 1:01:54.436
or whatever the
fuck they wanna be.

1:01:58.507 --> 1:02:03.512
I make the rules and decide
who works for who, all right?

1:02:06.215 --> 1:02:10.186
Now, you must be Kinji Suzuki.

1:02:10.220 --> 1:02:12.088
Is that right?

1:02:12.122 --> 1:02:13.556
Yes, that's me.

1:02:13.591 --> 1:02:15.158
What do you want?

1:02:15.191 --> 1:02:16.526
What I want from you?

1:02:18.094 --> 1:02:20.330
Well that's a million fucking
dollar question, mate.

1:02:20.363 --> 1:02:22.265
But it's not what
I want from you,

1:02:22.299 --> 1:02:25.135
it's what some fucking
Yakuza mob wants from you,

1:02:25.168 --> 1:02:27.237
and they want me
to hand you over

1:02:28.972 --> 1:02:30.173
for a lot of fucking money.

1:02:31.908 --> 1:02:35.146
And I want to know what makes
you so fucking valuable.

1:02:37.348 --> 1:02:40.084
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1:02:40.117 --> 1:02:43.187
I have no idea who these
people are or what they wanted.

1:02:44.255 --> 1:02:46.090
Maybe you have the wrong person.

1:02:46.123 --> 1:02:48.292
There are many
Kinji's in London.

1:02:48.326 --> 1:02:49.994
Yeah there fucking are,

1:02:50.027 --> 1:02:51.195
that's why it took so long

1:02:51.228 --> 1:02:52.863
to fucking find
you, didn't it, huh?

1:02:54.298 --> 1:02:57.469
But what did you do to get
the Yakuza mob on your back?

1:02:57.502 --> 1:02:59.137
- Nothing.
- That's what I want to know.

1:02:59.171 --> 1:03:01.006
Nothing, please.

1:03:01.039 --> 1:03:02.174
I've done nothing.

1:03:02.974 --> 1:03:05.544
They must, it must be
a different last name.

1:03:05.578 --> 1:03:08.213
Su, Suzumi.

1:03:16.121 --> 1:03:17.322
All right, let him go.

1:03:21.394 --> 1:03:22.462
Go on.

1:03:22.495 --> 1:03:23.329
Listen,

1:03:25.365 --> 1:03:27.367
it doesn't matter what
I've done to them,

1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:29.202
you can't hand me over.

1:03:29.235 --> 1:03:30.436
They'll kill my family.

1:03:32.205 --> 1:03:33.373
I don't think you seem

1:03:33.406 --> 1:03:35.274
to understand the
situation here, mate.

1:03:35.308 --> 1:03:37.578
We'll be doing the killing
if you don't tell me

1:03:37.611 --> 1:03:39.979
what I want to fucking hear!

1:03:40.012 --> 1:03:41.514
Okay, okay, look.

1:03:42.716 --> 1:03:45.419
I'll pay you double
what they're paying,

1:03:45.452 --> 1:03:47.421
just give me a week
to get the money.

1:03:47.454 --> 1:03:49.356
I'll get you the
money, I promise.

1:03:49.390 --> 1:03:53.327
Just please, don't hand
me over to them, please.

1:03:54.995 --> 1:03:56.096
I'll tell ya what,

1:03:56.130 --> 1:03:59.366
I'll give you three days
to get me two million quid.

1:04:00.334 --> 1:04:03.003
That's two million quid, yeah?

1:04:04.138 --> 1:04:07.374
Or I hand you over to them
on a silver fucking platter.

1:04:07.408 --> 1:04:10.311
Please, just don't
hand me over to them.

1:04:15.150 --> 1:04:20.121
All right, all right, just
calm down mate, calm down.

1:04:21.289 --> 1:04:22.190
But if I find out
you're lying to me,

1:04:22.223 --> 1:04:25.226
if you don't hand over
the fucking money,

1:04:25.260 --> 1:04:29.097
this will all be over
before you know it, yeah?

1:04:30.265 --> 1:04:31.099
All of it.

1:04:37.306 --> 1:04:38.608
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1:04:38.642 --> 1:04:40.342
This man's got
some money to find.

1:04:44.013 --> 1:04:45.514
I like what you've
done with the place.

1:04:45.548 --> 1:04:47.684
Got a bit of classic Asia to it.

1:04:49.418 --> 1:04:51.353
Be a shame if it all
came burning down.

1:04:54.156 --> 1:04:55.458
See you around, Kinji.

1:05:05.168 --> 1:05:07.705
- Hey my love.
- Kinji, what's going on?

1:05:07.738 --> 1:05:09.172
Who were those men?

1:05:09.206 --> 1:05:10.440
What do they want?

1:05:10.474 --> 1:05:11.508
Listen, I will explain
everything later, okay?

1:05:11.541 --> 1:05:14.411
Just get what you need
and go get the kids, okay?

1:05:15.412 --> 1:05:17.782
Yasuyuki's arriving any minute
to take you somewhere safe

1:05:17.815 --> 1:05:20.217
while I figure all this,
this stuff out, okay?

1:05:20.251 --> 1:05:21.452
Just please, please
listen to me.

1:05:21.486 --> 1:05:23.454
I need to get you and
the kids somewhere safe.

1:05:23.488 --> 1:05:25.189
But Kinji, you said this
would be the last time we move.

1:05:25.223 --> 1:05:27.358
I know, I know, I'm
sorry and I promise

1:05:27.391 --> 1:05:29.527
I will make it up
to you, I promise.

1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:30.796
But what about the kids?

1:05:30.829 --> 1:05:32.664
They were settled
in their schools.

1:05:32.698 --> 1:05:33.599
How long will it be?

1:05:33.632 --> 1:05:34.666
I don't know until I can,

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:37.301
Until I can fix everything
and sort everything out.

1:05:37.335 --> 1:05:38.704
Yasuyuki's here, we gotta go.

1:05:40.691 --> 1:05:43.110
Here, take these bags and pack
whatever you need to.

1:05:43.151 --> 1:05:46.030
We need to leave right away.

1:05:46.109 --> 1:05:47.479
My love, just go get the kids,

1:05:47.513 --> 1:05:48.447
I'll help pack the bags, okay?

1:05:48.480 --> 1:05:50.148
Yasuyuki's gonna take
you somewhere safe,

1:05:50.182 --> 1:05:51.751
I promise I'll be with
you as soon as I can.

1:05:51.972 --> 1:05:53.041
Quick. Hurry!

1:05:53.081 --> 1:05:55.287
Okay, this will be the last
time, you have my word.

1:05:56.589 --> 1:05:58.524
Mio, Jumpei.

1:06:13.641 --> 1:06:17.645
What you mean, endask
isn't a word, come on.

1:06:17.678 --> 1:06:18.511
Jesus.

1:06:21.514 --> 1:06:22.515
Kinji Suzuki.

1:06:22.549 --> 1:06:23.383
Oh Jesus Christ,

1:06:24.350 --> 1:06:25.451
how many times do I
have to tell you guys?

1:06:25.485 --> 1:06:26.286
Ask the fucking Russians.

1:06:29.590 --> 1:06:30.624
Russians?

1:06:30.658 --> 1:06:31.491
Yes.

1:06:32.594 --> 1:06:35.697
Whoa, you don't, you don't
look like one of them.

1:06:37.832 --> 1:06:40.769
I am the Yakuza.

1:06:40.802 --> 1:06:42.503
Okay, I, I, I don't
know where he is, okay?

1:06:42.536 --> 1:06:45.740
Like I told the others,
just ask the Russians.

1:06:45.774 --> 1:06:47.174
Where can I find the Russians?

1:06:47.207 --> 1:06:48.542
Majestic Soho,
just please, please,

1:06:48.577 --> 1:06:49.744
please leave me out of it.

1:06:49.778 --> 1:06:51.780
Just don't tell
him, I, just don't,

1:06:51.813 --> 1:06:53.615
don't tell him I told you where.

1:07:00.790 --> 1:07:02.324
Oh come on, man.

1:07:03.659 --> 1:07:04.727
For your inconvenience.

1:07:08.363 --> 1:07:09.197
For me?

1:07:14.737 --> 1:07:16.371
You better not be lying to me.

1:07:17.472 --> 1:07:18.674
I am not lying.

1:07:23.614 --> 1:07:24.648
Okay.

1:07:34.625 --> 1:07:35.458
Wow.

1:07:45.469 --> 1:07:46.470
Get to work.

1:08:34.821 --> 1:08:35.889
All right, all
right, all right.

1:08:35.922 --> 1:08:39.358
All right, all right, fun's
over boys, fun's over.

1:08:39.391 --> 1:08:40.426
Gotta talk business.

1:08:40.459 --> 1:08:41.293
Go on, Vanessa.

1:08:42.829 --> 1:08:43.863
Right.

1:08:44.798 --> 1:08:46.866
It's been three days.

1:08:46.900 --> 1:08:49.501
It's time to collect
our money, yeah?

1:08:49.535 --> 1:08:50.904
Yes boss.

1:08:50.937 --> 1:08:52.872
So should we take
all the lads or?

1:08:54.641 --> 1:08:56.576
What can one little
Asian man do, huh?

1:08:56.610 --> 1:08:59.914
We gotta keep our
bases covered, yeah?

1:08:59.947 --> 1:09:01.816
Just get out there,
find our money,

1:09:01.849 --> 1:09:04.250
bring him back
here in one piece.

1:09:04.284 --> 1:09:06.787
What you mean boss, what,
are we finishing him off?

1:09:06.821 --> 1:09:09.255
Nah, I haven't decided yet.

1:09:09.990 --> 1:09:12.492
I don't trust him, yeah.

1:09:13.794 --> 1:09:14.995
We gotta find out
what he's hiding

1:09:15.029 --> 1:09:16.864
and what makes him so valuable.

1:09:18.065 --> 1:09:19.499
So that Yakuza mob,

1:09:21.002 --> 1:09:22.436
we can't have them
coming to this town

1:09:22.470 --> 1:09:24.405
thinking they run
the place, yeah?

1:09:24.438 --> 1:09:25.607
'Cause that's not how

1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:26.574
we do business around
here boys, is it?

1:09:26.608 --> 1:09:27.776
Damn right it's not.

1:09:27.809 --> 1:09:29.711
Anything you want
boss, anything.

1:09:29.745 --> 1:09:30.679
Good, well quit sitting here

1:09:30.712 --> 1:09:33.314
like a bunch of fucking
tarts, get out there,

1:09:33.347 --> 1:09:35.784
find my money, bring
him back here now.

1:09:35.817 --> 1:09:38.620
And turn the restaurant
upside down if you have to.

1:09:38.653 --> 1:09:40.856
Whatever he's hiding, is
gonna be there somewhere.

1:09:40.889 --> 1:09:42.490
We're on it boss.

1:09:43.491 --> 1:09:44.459
All right boss, we'll
be back soon, all right.

1:09:44.493 --> 1:09:45.895
Yeah.

1:09:51.968 --> 1:09:52.935
This is the one.

1:09:52.969 --> 1:09:53.936
All right, gonna rough
him up good and proper

1:09:53.970 --> 1:09:56.505
before we bring him back
to the boss, all right?

1:09:56.538 --> 1:09:59.474
Can we get some food
in before we head back?

1:09:59.508 --> 1:10:00.943
It's proper tasty here.

1:10:00.977 --> 1:10:03.646
Don't be so
ridiculous you fat fuck.

1:10:03.679 --> 1:10:04.814
Have some will power.

1:10:04.847 --> 1:10:06.348
We'll get some food later.

1:10:06.381 --> 1:10:07.784
Fuckin' starvin'.

1:10:07.817 --> 1:10:08.952
You just have to
control yourself then,

1:10:08.986 --> 1:10:10.020
you mug, wouldn't ya?

1:10:11.454 --> 1:10:12.723
I'll try.

1:10:12.756 --> 1:10:13.556
Can't promise anything.

1:10:14.423 --> 1:10:15.058
Kinji.

1:10:16.459 --> 1:10:19.830
Open up, open this
fucking door, now.

1:10:19.863 --> 1:10:20.731
Kinji!

1:10:20.764 --> 1:10:22.065
Open the fucking door.

1:10:23.566 --> 1:10:24.400
Come on.

1:10:25.869 --> 1:10:27.037
Kinji.

1:10:27.070 --> 1:10:28.972
I said open up the door.

1:10:36.580 --> 1:10:37.414
Kinji.

1:10:39.083 --> 1:10:41.085
Open the fucking door.

1:10:41.119 --> 1:10:42.921
You fucking deaf?

1:10:42.954 --> 1:10:45.023
What you got the door
locked for, you mug?

1:10:45.056 --> 1:10:46.456
Where's our fucking money?

1:10:48.092 --> 1:10:49.761
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

1:10:49.794 --> 1:10:51.461
The Yakuza will stop at nothing

1:10:51.495 --> 1:10:52.697
until they get what they want.

1:10:52.730 --> 1:10:55.432
Just fucking let us
worry about the Yakuza.

1:10:55.465 --> 1:10:56.836
This is our town,

1:10:56.869 --> 1:10:58.971
nobody tells us how to
do things around here.

1:10:59.004 --> 1:11:00.873
Especially not
some Japanese mob.

1:11:00.906 --> 1:11:02.641
Now go and get us
our fucking money.

1:11:02.675 --> 1:11:04.109
Okay, okay.

1:11:04.143 --> 1:11:04.944
It's in my office.

1:11:04.977 --> 1:11:06.145
Over there.

1:11:06.178 --> 1:11:07.378
I'll get it for you.

1:11:07.412 --> 1:11:08.814
No.

1:11:08.848 --> 1:11:11.050
We're here, we'll get it.

1:11:11.083 --> 1:11:12.685
George, go and get the money.

1:11:12.718 --> 1:11:13.518
All right boss.

1:11:13.551 --> 1:11:14.419
Hurry up.

1:11:14.452 --> 1:11:15.054
Good boy.

1:11:38.510 --> 1:11:39.713
It's all here, Dylan.

1:11:39.746 --> 1:11:41.147
Now to hunger.

1:11:41.181 --> 1:11:45.552
Get some of that chicken teri,
teriyaki stuff now, yeah?

1:11:45.586 --> 1:11:47.054
Dylan!

1:11:47.088 --> 1:11:48.089
What the fuck?

1:11:48.122 --> 1:11:49.123
Dylan!

1:11:49.156 --> 1:11:49.991
What the?

1:13:01.265 --> 1:13:02.565
Follow him.

1:13:08.571 --> 1:13:09.940
Fuck.

1:13:09.974 --> 1:13:11.842
Where the fuck are they?

1:13:11.875 --> 1:13:13.811
They should have
been here by now.

1:13:13.844 --> 1:13:15.679
I dunno boss, they said
they're coming straight back.

1:13:15.713 --> 1:13:18.514
Yeah I know what
they said, you idiot.

1:13:18.548 --> 1:13:19.549
Don't just stand there,
go out there and find them

1:13:19.582 --> 1:13:21.086
and bring them back here now.

1:13:21.987 --> 1:13:22.887
- Eh?
- Yes boss.

1:13:22.921 --> 1:13:23.722
Come on.

1:13:23.755 --> 1:13:24.555
What, now?

1:13:24.589 --> 1:13:25.223
Yes!

1:13:27.192 --> 1:13:30.028
Don't worry baby,
I'm sure they're fine.

1:13:37.251 --> 1:13:40.087
Here...

1:13:45.676 --> 1:13:49.054
Thank you.

1:13:51.098 --> 1:13:54.476
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

1:13:54.518 --> 1:13:59.690
Everything's going to be just fine.
Don't you worry Junpei.

1:14:01.108 --> 1:14:04.570
Thank you for everything, Yasuyuki.

1:14:04.611 --> 1:14:08.115
Kinji told us to trust you.

1:14:08.156 --> 1:14:13.620
- I'm glad he has a friend like you.
- You're welcome.

1:14:14.621 --> 1:14:17.708
It's a dangerous city.

1:14:21.378 --> 1:14:24.631
We're all here for each other.

1:14:27.342 --> 1:14:32.806
Is this your house Yasuyuki?

1:16:11.029 --> 1:16:13.732
Hey, hey, isn't
that Yakuza, geezer?

1:16:13.765 --> 1:16:15.133
I think you're right, mate.

1:16:15.167 --> 1:16:16.735
What do you think we
should do, call boss?

1:16:16.768 --> 1:16:17.637
Of course we
should call the boss.

1:16:17.669 --> 1:16:19.271
Get to the back and
out what we need.

1:16:19.304 --> 1:16:20.105
Will do.

1:16:24.409 --> 1:16:25.243
Come on.

1:16:38.324 --> 1:16:39.759
Hey, Zeke.

1:16:39.792 --> 1:16:40.627
Can I have the shot
in this time, yeah?

1:16:40.661 --> 1:16:42.795
Yeah mate, go
on, it's your turn.

1:16:43.896 --> 1:16:45.097
All right, get in there.

1:16:50.986 --> 1:16:53.363
Kazuki...

1:16:53.947 --> 1:16:59.036
- How did you find me?
- You're not that hard to find, Kinji.

1:16:59.077 --> 1:17:02.247
You didn't think moving to the other side
of the world

1:17:02.289 --> 1:17:05.334
would prevent us from finding you, did you?

1:17:05.375 --> 1:17:08.337
- Give me that bag!
- What are you going to do with it?

1:17:08.378 --> 1:17:11.256
You can't release it, no one would...

1:17:11.298 --> 1:17:16.230
We'll decide what's best for it.
It was never yours to take, Kinji.

1:17:16.282 --> 1:17:17.550
Well well well.

1:17:17.998 --> 1:17:20.835
If it isn't tweedle dumb and
tweedle fucking dee, huh?

1:17:22.971 --> 1:17:24.372
You finally found him, boys.

1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:26.274
Good job.

1:17:27.875 --> 1:17:30.979
Now, what the fuck is
going on in here, eh?

1:17:31.012 --> 1:17:32.880
Stay back, Vincent.

1:17:32.914 --> 1:17:34.816
He belongs to me now.

1:17:34.849 --> 1:17:37.852
You've played your
part in finding him,

1:17:37.885 --> 1:17:39.787
whatever part that was.

1:17:39.821 --> 1:17:42.991
Now, just turn around
and go back to your club.

1:17:44.360 --> 1:17:46.895
Otherwise, I start shooting.

1:17:48.931 --> 1:17:51.166
Turn around and go
back to our fucking club?

1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:53.102
Are you having a
fucking laugh, mate?

1:17:53.135 --> 1:17:55.271
Who the fuck do you
think you are, huh?

1:17:55.304 --> 1:17:56.905
You think you can come here
and just take my people

1:17:56.939 --> 1:17:59.842
willy fucking nilly, huh?

1:17:59.875 --> 1:18:01.944
I don't know what you want.

1:18:01.977 --> 1:18:03.545
Just let the two of us leave.

1:18:03.579 --> 1:18:05.948
We can call this a day, huh?

1:18:05.981 --> 1:18:08.251
I have what I need now.

1:18:08.285 --> 1:18:09.819
Yeah?

1:18:09.853 --> 1:18:11.354
And what is it that
you need so badly

1:18:11.388 --> 1:18:13.323
that you flew all this
way over for, huh?

1:18:13.356 --> 1:18:15.292
He belongs to the Yakuza.

1:18:15.325 --> 1:18:16.226
It's our property.

1:18:16.259 --> 1:18:18.461
It has nothing to do with you!

1:18:18.495 --> 1:18:20.497
I'll fucking decide
if it's got anything

1:18:20.530 --> 1:18:24.100
to do with me or not, you
fucking walnut, all right?

1:18:24.134 --> 1:18:28.038
Now I've decided, I want
what's in that fucking bag.

1:18:28.071 --> 1:18:29.039
No no no no no.

1:18:29.072 --> 1:18:32.376
I will never let this
out of my sight again.

1:18:32.410 --> 1:18:34.512
It doesn't belong to you.

1:18:35.546 --> 1:18:37.148
Fucking hell.

1:18:39.016 --> 1:18:40.318
Vincente!

1:18:40.351 --> 1:18:41.519
There you are.

1:18:42.486 --> 1:18:43.321
Long time.

1:18:44.955 --> 1:18:47.626
Who would have thought that
we would be together again

1:18:47.659 --> 1:18:50.961
in the same building
just like old times?

1:18:50.995 --> 1:18:54.565
My fucking god, what the fuck
are you lot doing here, huh?

1:18:54.598 --> 1:18:55.668
I didn't ask for your
input on this one.

1:18:55.702 --> 1:19:00.005
We can handle this by our
fucking self, all right?

1:19:00.038 --> 1:19:03.041
Like Bob Dylan sing, the
times they are a changing,

1:19:03.075 --> 1:19:06.078
and you, are losing control

1:19:06.111 --> 1:19:08.580
over whatever you think
you have control of.

1:19:09.749 --> 1:19:12.618
I mean, who would let the
Japanese mob walk all over you?

1:19:12.652 --> 1:19:15.921
We had a partnership,
you broke it!

1:19:15.954 --> 1:19:17.856
Now I am going solo.

1:19:19.124 --> 1:19:21.060
I want what is in that bag.

1:19:22.061 --> 1:19:25.131
If it's so fucking valuable,
Moscow will have a piece of it.

1:19:25.164 --> 1:19:28.501
All right, now
listen here, Igor.

1:19:28.534 --> 1:19:31.337
Firstly, you work
for me you bald fuck.

1:19:31.371 --> 1:19:34.907
This ain't a fucking
partnership, yeah?

1:19:34.941 --> 1:19:36.142
And secondly, I ain't letting

1:19:36.175 --> 1:19:38.044
any Japanese mob
walk all over me,

1:19:38.077 --> 1:19:39.245
'cause as of right now mate,

1:19:39.278 --> 1:19:40.880
there is no fucking
Japanese mob.

1:19:46.186 --> 1:19:48.021
What took you so long?

1:19:53.227 --> 1:19:54.261
Chop chop.

1:19:55.129 --> 1:19:56.363
All right, now Kinji,

1:19:58.198 --> 1:19:59.967
where the fuck are my boys?

1:20:01.001 --> 1:20:02.169
Kinji wake the fuck up now!

1:20:04.138 --> 1:20:09.144
Sorry, they're in my
fridge, in the kitchen.

1:20:10.078 --> 1:20:10.613
In your fucking what?

1:20:12.213 --> 1:20:13.281
In the fridge.

1:20:14.482 --> 1:20:16.619
Don't worry, I turned the
temperature up, they're okay.

1:20:16.652 --> 1:20:18.420
What the fuck?

1:20:18.453 --> 1:20:20.455
All right, we got
what we came for.

1:20:22.257 --> 1:20:23.726
What do we do, boss?

1:20:23.759 --> 1:20:27.128
We are not leaving
without that backpack.

1:20:27.162 --> 1:20:28.329
Do you understand?

1:20:28.363 --> 1:20:30.198
And if you want to have
a gun fight with us,

1:20:30.231 --> 1:20:31.534
you know who's
going to win, huh?

1:20:39.175 --> 1:20:43.112
Nobody, extorts my restaurant
and threatens my family.

1:20:43.145 --> 1:20:43.979
Nobody!

1:20:52.221 --> 1:20:54.089
Fucking brilliant.

1:20:54.123 --> 1:20:55.090
Fucking!

1:20:56.393 --> 1:20:58.061
This guy.

1:20:58.094 --> 1:21:00.030
Steven, sort these fucking
two idiots out, will ya.

1:21:12.409 --> 1:21:17.380
I'll see you around Kinji, yeah?

1:21:18.148 --> 1:21:19.550
And one more thing,

1:21:19.584 --> 1:21:20.719
thanks for the backpack.

1:21:24.422 --> 1:21:25.456
Now,

1:21:27.626 --> 1:21:31.195
go back to your family and
live whatever normal life

1:21:31.229 --> 1:21:32.631
you lot fucking get up to.

1:21:34.198 --> 1:21:36.534
If you keep your head down,
you might just get by.

1:21:58.210 --> 1:22:01.630
Yasuyuki! Are they okay?

1:22:03.882 --> 1:22:06.009
Thank god.

1:22:06.051 --> 1:22:09.972
Thank you. Thank you!

1:22:10.472 --> 1:22:13.392
I'll be there as soon as I can.

1:22:59.354 --> 1:23:01.773
- Kinji!
- Sakura!

1:23:01.815 --> 1:23:03.859
Yasuyuki!

1:23:04.902 --> 1:23:07.487
What are you doing!?
Put that gun down!

1:23:07.529 --> 1:23:09.865
Sakura, are you okay?

1:23:09.907 --> 1:23:11.909
Where is Junpei and Mio!?

1:23:11.950 --> 1:23:14.286
Kinji...

1:23:14.953 --> 1:23:18.040
Where's the device?

1:23:19.583 --> 1:23:22.127
What device?

1:23:22.169 --> 1:23:24.171
Don't play dumb Kinji!

1:23:25.923 --> 1:23:29.760
I saw you put it in your backpack at the restaurant.

1:23:29.801 --> 1:23:32.221
If you don't give it to me...

1:23:34.264 --> 1:23:35.891
No, no!

1:23:35.933 --> 1:23:39.102
Leave Sakura out of this! She's done nothing.

1:23:39.770 --> 1:23:44.608
The backpack Kinji. I'm running out of patience.

1:23:44.650 --> 1:23:49.279
Look, I don't have it anymore! Vincent has it.

1:23:49.321 --> 1:23:53.325
He took it from me after he killed the Russians!

1:23:54.910 --> 1:23:56.453
When?

1:23:57.162 --> 1:24:01.166
Before I got here!
I led them all to a warehouse.

1:24:01.208 --> 1:24:05.170
Why are you doing this Yasuyuki?
I trusted you...

1:24:07.130 --> 1:24:09.716
Well, you were mistaken.

1:24:09.758 --> 1:24:16.890
Give me that backpack
or your wife and kids will die.

1:24:16.932 --> 1:24:18.809
No!

1:24:20.519 --> 1:24:24.189
Where is Junpei, Mio?

1:24:25.190 --> 1:24:28.360
They are tied up somewhere safe, for now.

1:24:31.613 --> 1:24:34.867
How did you know about the backpack?

1:24:35.993 --> 1:24:42.958
Didn't they teach you anything
in government intelligence?

1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.921
I've been watching you all of this time, Kinji.

1:25:06.982 --> 1:25:10.402
The night the Russians first came to your restaurant.

1:25:32.674 --> 1:25:36.845
And who do you think sent Kazuki to find you.

1:25:37.846 --> 1:25:41.266
You didn't think Hideshi would just let you go,
did you Kinji?

1:25:41.308 --> 1:25:44.978
Make sure you return what is ours,
no matter what.

1:25:46.897 --> 1:25:50.359
Well done, you should be proud.

1:26:05.624 --> 1:26:10.504
You've been playing me this whole time?
Ever since...

1:26:12.005 --> 1:26:15.759
Yes Kinji, ever since I first found you here in London.

1:26:17.344 --> 1:26:21.682
- Well done for finally working it out.
- Stop.

1:26:21.723 --> 1:26:25.811
I have it. It's in the back of my car.

1:26:26.395 --> 1:26:32.192
I have to go outside to get it for you...
just leave my family alone.

1:26:32.234 --> 1:26:38.699
Not so fast, Kinji, you will lead me to it.
I'm not that stupid.

1:26:38.740 --> 1:26:40.492
Okay.

1:26:40.534 --> 1:26:47.749
- Please!
- Shut up! I'm talking. Bring me to it now!

1:26:54.965 --> 1:26:57.467
This way.

1:27:00.262 --> 1:27:01.763
- Where is it?
- Over there.

1:27:01.805 --> 1:27:04.349
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

1:27:07.227 --> 1:27:10.272
It's inside the boot.

1:27:10.898 --> 1:27:13.609
Hurry! Hurry up!

1:27:13.650 --> 1:27:15.944
- It's inside the boot.
- Hurry up!

1:27:16.486 --> 1:27:18.488
Okay.

1:27:26.246 --> 1:27:30.167
Now let Sakura go and you can have the backpack.

1:27:33.253 --> 1:27:35.797
I don't think you're in a position
to be making demands.

1:27:35.839 --> 1:27:38.759
Oh yeah, how about now...

1:27:40.344 --> 1:27:44.056
Stop!
One more move and I destroy the device.

1:27:44.097 --> 1:27:46.225
If you don't believe me, you are welcome to try.

1:27:46.266 --> 1:27:49.978
Let Sakura go and you can have the backpack.

1:27:51.313 --> 1:27:53.857
I don't believe you. You would never...

1:27:53.899 --> 1:27:58.904
Yasuyuki, whatever's inside doesn't mean
as much to me as my family.

1:27:59.988 --> 1:28:04.451
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes
to make sure they are safe.

1:28:09.503 --> 1:28:11.991
Sakura!
Sakura, are you okay?

1:28:36.233 --> 1:28:40.577
I'm so sorry.
I never meant to put you through any of this.

1:28:43.323 --> 1:28:46.451
Mio, Junpei!

1:28:46.493 --> 1:28:48.996
Are you okay?

1:29:01.466 --> 1:29:02.913
Junpei! Mio!

1:29:26.891 --> 1:29:27.792
I said that, you know.

1:29:27.826 --> 1:29:29.593
Aw, thank you.

1:29:29.626 --> 1:29:31.628
Oh yeah, did you see his face?

1:29:31.663 --> 1:29:33.231
Georgy, love ya mate.

1:29:36.134 --> 1:29:38.236
Hey boys, let's have a toast.

1:29:38.269 --> 1:29:39.170
- Toast?
- Yeah?

1:29:39.204 --> 1:29:41.106
To our fucking good health

1:29:41.139 --> 1:29:43.709
and to teaching those
fuckers who runs this town.

1:29:43.743 --> 1:29:45.277
- Yeah!
- Hey, cheers!

1:29:50.716 --> 1:29:53.152
I am so sorry, my love.

1:29:53.185 --> 1:29:55.788
I never meant for any
of this to happen.

1:29:55.821 --> 1:29:58.090
This will all be
over now, I promise.

1:30:00.192 --> 1:30:02.161
How can you be so sure?

1:30:02.194 --> 1:30:04.596
You've said this to
me several times now.

1:30:05.264 --> 1:30:06.564
And look where we are.

1:30:13.306 --> 1:30:14.775
In about 30 seconds,

1:30:16.243 --> 1:30:18.577
we'll never have to worry
about anything ever again.

1:30:20.147 --> 1:30:21.580
Why?

1:30:21.614 --> 1:30:23.316
What's happening in 30 seconds?

1:30:31.959 --> 1:30:35.029
It's just a present I left
for someone, that's all.

1:30:39.333 --> 1:30:40.567
Kinji?

1:30:42.070 --> 1:30:42.970
Trust me.

1:30:44.338 --> 1:30:45.173
Trust me.

1:30:47.241 --> 1:30:49.243
Hey boys, any
thoughts on what seat

1:30:49.277 --> 1:30:51.145
we should take over next, huh?

1:30:51.179 --> 1:30:51.946
Russia.

1:30:51.979 --> 1:30:52.980
Russia?

1:30:53.014 --> 1:30:54.649
It's a fucking country, mate.

1:30:54.682 --> 1:30:56.985
It's the fucking
same, ain't it?

1:30:57.019 --> 1:30:57.820
Fucking cold there.

1:30:57.853 --> 1:30:58.654
Somewhere warm.

1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:06.395
Oh shit.

1:31:30.490 --> 1:31:33.723
Kinji!

1:31:42.733 --> 1:31:44.101
What's wrong?

1:31:44.135 --> 1:31:46.837
Is everything all right, Kinji?

1:31:46.871 --> 1:31:48.639
Everything is fine.

1:31:50.808 --> 1:31:53.377
Everything is perfectly fine.

1:31:58.782 --> 1:32:01.919
So how do you all feel
about moving to New York?

1:32:04.788 --> 1:32:05.456
New York?

1:32:11.796 --> 1:32:13.298
Come on guys, let's go home.

1:32:18.370 --> 1:32:20.305
Jumpei, you want to see the
Statue of Liberty, right?

1:32:20.338 --> 1:32:21.806
Yeah.
