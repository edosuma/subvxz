WEBVTT

02:17.792 --> 02:19.208
Come on, we're at Pondolem.

02:20.333 --> 02:21.625
Let's go, Pondolem.

02:25.583 --> 02:26.875
Let's go, Pondolem.

02:32.958 --> 02:34.125
Be careful, Peter.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.667
Where is Pondolem police station,
the new one?

02:41.875 --> 02:43.417
-Are you a police officer?
-Yes.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.833
Here it is.
Right in front of us.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.208
-It was inaugurated just last week.
-I see.

02:50.708 --> 02:53.917
The faded one right next to it
is the old police station.

02:54.917 --> 02:56.125
Okay, thanks.

02:56.417 --> 02:58.125
Police officers have breakfast here.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.958
Some of them eat breakfast,
lunch and dinner right here.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.958
-I see.
-Come over after duty hours.

03:05.958 --> 03:07.375
I'll serve you chilled beer
and fried fish.

03:09.042 --> 03:10.042
Let's see.

03:19.375 --> 03:20.542
Excuse me.

03:21.208 --> 03:23.458
-Who is the senior PI?
-Who are you?

03:23.958 --> 03:26.167
Satish Naik.
I have been transferred here.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.292
Sir, do come in. You're welcome.

03:30.792 --> 03:33.292
Have a seat.
Sir will be here, soon.

03:44.125 --> 03:45.167
Listen.

03:47.292 --> 03:51.208
-Isn't that Vijay Salgaonkar?
-Yes, sir. That's him.

03:51.833 --> 03:53.542
He seems to be pretty
straight forward.

03:54.083 --> 03:57.125
But appearances can be deceptive, sir.

03:57.458 --> 04:00.208
-What do you mean?
-I mean, what he has done...

04:00.917 --> 04:02.083
is still pretty unbelievable.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.042
Hey, get him!

04:41.000 --> 04:41.875
Go!

04:51.000 --> 04:53.917
-That was an awesome chase, sir!
-Awesome?

04:54.833 --> 04:56.997
They've edited it with fast cuts
and taken the audience for a ride.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.497
On top of that,
the music is pounding away!

04:58.597 --> 05:01.583
So that it seems as if a lot is going on,
but nothing is really happening.

05:01.958 --> 05:03.292
You need to feel the tension. Feel it!

05:03.917 --> 05:05.750
Mr. Vijay, I have an idea.

05:06.042 --> 05:09.833
You should make a movie.
Then the world will see that you...

05:10.500 --> 05:13.750
-I'll show it to you, first.
-No, Mr. Vijay! Sorry, sir!

05:14.000 --> 05:16.875
-Are you done with the collections?
-Yes, I'm done. Here, look.

05:17.875 --> 05:20.958
As always,
Inspector Gaitonde cribbed a bit.

05:21.083 --> 05:23.667
And Uncle Pinto's TV is flickering.

05:23.750 --> 05:26.000
That's a problem with his TV.
It's not a cable issue.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.500
-Tell him to buy a new one.
-You bet, I did!

05:28.958 --> 05:30.167
-Then?
-Rascal.

05:32.417 --> 05:34.917
-That's what he called you.
-And you let him abuse me?

05:35.083 --> 05:37.167
No, I didn't! I told him.

05:37.458 --> 05:41.917
I said, if you want to abuse Mr. Vijay,
say something logical.

05:42.417 --> 05:46.000
You can call him uneducated,
illiterate, 4th grade dropout

05:46.083 --> 05:47.875
call him an orphan. But...

05:49.917 --> 05:51.833
Am I right?

05:51.917 --> 05:53.583
-All right, then!
-Listen to me.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.292
You're right. I'll give you a bonus.

05:56.833 --> 05:59.542
Mr. Vijay, no! Sir, no!

06:10.958 --> 06:14.292
-He's waiting for SI Gaitonde.
-Why?

06:16.417 --> 06:19.250
He locked up his only son in prison.

06:20.208 --> 06:21.208
What did he do?

06:22.083 --> 06:25.250
Nothing, he took a loan
from a private finance company.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.417
He used to pay
all the installments on time.

06:27.833 --> 06:30.250
He just wasn't able to pay
the final installment.

06:31.167 --> 06:33.792
Mr. Gaitonde took my son away
two days ago.

06:34.167 --> 06:36.083
Now, the finance company is also saying...

06:36.458 --> 06:38.750
that the installment has to be paid
with interest first.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.667
That's when they'll let my son go.

06:43.292 --> 06:44.833
Why is Gaitonde taking
such an interest in this?

06:44.917 --> 06:47.708
Because his cousin runs
the finance company.

06:48.708 --> 06:52.167
-So, did you complain to Mr. Prabhu?
-Mr. Gaitonde told me...

06:53.083 --> 06:54.917
if I complain to anyone at all...

06:56.042 --> 06:57.458
then, he will kill my son.

06:58.125 --> 07:01.708
-Anyway, what's the point of complaining?
-File a lawsuit in the court then.

07:03.042 --> 07:04.042
On whom?

07:04.458 --> 07:06.958
His son wasn't locked up
by the finance company,

07:07.542 --> 07:09.083
Gaitonde did that.

07:11.792 --> 07:14.000
There is only one way
to get your brother out.

07:14.292 --> 07:16.083
-What's that?
-Habeas corpus.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.542
I'll tell you what to do. Habeas corpus.

07:19.875 --> 07:23.667
-What? Hibbus...
-Habeas corpus. It's a legal term.

07:23.833 --> 07:27.792
-How will that help?
-His son will get released, because...

07:27.958 --> 07:30.625
This is not an ordinary case.
This is a case involving habeas corpus.

07:30.958 --> 07:32.458
And if they tell the court

07:32.542 --> 07:35.375
that someone has locked up
his son illegally...

07:35.458 --> 07:37.292
Then the court will order the police to...

07:37.792 --> 07:40.083
present the man in the court at once.

07:40.250 --> 07:44.292
Then Gaitonde, or the senior PI or IG,
can't ignore the court's order.

07:44.458 --> 07:46.458
The police won't present him in the court.

07:46.917 --> 07:49.375
Because Gaitonde locked him up illegally.

07:49.542 --> 07:52.375
Why don't you do this?
I know a lawyer in Panaji.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.500
Shirish Kamath, I'll give you his number.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.250
Tell him this is a matter
concerning habeas corpus.

07:57.583 --> 07:58.667
I'll speak to him, too.

08:01.167 --> 08:02.875
Speak of the devil
and the devil appears!

08:03.542 --> 08:06.417
-He's coming this way.
-You have to get out of here!

08:06.667 --> 08:07.958
Leave, by the back door!

08:14.292 --> 08:17.208
Hey, Martin!
Did an old couple come in here?

08:17.958 --> 08:20.042
-Not at all.
-Where the heck did they go?

08:34.417 --> 08:35.625
What do you think?

08:36.167 --> 08:37.958
Are you the only one who can act?

08:38.250 --> 08:41.000
Today I have managed to act, somehow.

08:41.292 --> 08:42.458
I love you, Dad.

08:42.875 --> 08:46.333
Come on and wipe your tears, Dad.
Here's the handkerchief.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.417
Wipe your tears!

08:48.917 --> 08:52.167
You now carry a handkerchief
in your pocket?

08:52.708 --> 08:55.792
Sumi, I don't have to worry
about anything!

08:56.458 --> 08:59.167
-Your son is very responsible, now.
-Mr. Vijay. Mr. Vijay!

08:59.875 --> 09:01.875
Can I go home? It's really late.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.708
Yes, yes.

09:16.875 --> 09:20.250
Yes, I'll do that. Right away!

09:22.000 --> 09:23.833
It seems you received quite a drubbing.
What is it?

09:24.042 --> 09:25.500
Actually, it's Aunt Saldanha.

09:25.708 --> 09:28.583
The amplifier near her place
is not working. So I am...

09:29.042 --> 09:30.792
You just changed that three days ago.

09:31.417 --> 09:32.792
I forgot about that.

09:33.667 --> 09:36.458
-That's nice, you deserve the drubbing.
-I'm going there, at once.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.250
What else did you forget?

09:42.417 --> 09:44.125
Hello, I...

09:45.083 --> 09:47.625
Yes, done.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.250
Mr. Shirodkar, who is 75 years old,
has a request.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.833
Screen a nice, adult movie, today.

09:56.708 --> 09:59.167
But, wasn't he paralyzed?

09:59.833 --> 10:02.708
Come on, Mr. Vijay.
His left side is paralyzed.

10:02.958 --> 10:04.500
Whereas Shirodkar is right handed.

10:04.958 --> 10:06.875
-Get lost! Scat!
-No, I'm going.

10:07.292 --> 10:09.958
We can't lose, Dad.
We have to win.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.458
I love you, Dad.

10:12.792 --> 10:13.875
My son.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.667
-How are the studies coming along?
-Fine.

10:49.208 --> 10:51.417
-Where is Mom?
-In the kitchen.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.000
Where are the keys to the vault?
Tell me the truth!

11:08.750 --> 11:12.000
Which vault? I really don't know.
Let me go, please.

11:12.083 --> 11:13.333
Who knows if you don't?

11:16.667 --> 11:18.583
-Vijay...
-Who is Vijay?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.167
The man who is threatening me
with a carrot.

11:21.833 --> 11:24.042
It seems he hasn't even bathed yet.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.167
You're reeking of sweat.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.417
I'd bathe if you heat the water.

11:29.792 --> 11:32.042
Check in the bathroom. It's already there.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.542
-You come, too.
-Get away, naughty!

11:41.000 --> 11:42.042
Go!

11:47.583 --> 11:48.917
So, where is Miss India?

11:49.708 --> 11:51.875
She's probably rehearsing
how her cat walks in front of the mirror.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.875
-Anu!
-I'll be right there, Mom.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.875
I called you last night,
but I couldn't get through.

12:03.292 --> 12:05.958
-Did the phone die on you again?
-Yes.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.458
Why don't you buy a cell phone?

12:09.875 --> 12:12.000
What's the use?
That place is out of range.

12:12.333 --> 12:15.792
Really? So, how does Jose get
the range on his mobile?

12:16.625 --> 12:20.042
It's not like that, you want
an excuse to be away from us.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.875
The three of us stay here alone
and you are...

12:22.958 --> 12:24.125
One moment.

12:24.292 --> 12:26.875
Since there are three of you,
you're not alone.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.542
Don't crack silly jokes.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.917
You'd rather sit in office
and watch movies than come home.

12:36.875 --> 12:39.042
You don't have any sense
of responsibility towards us.

12:39.417 --> 12:41.542
You should consider us, at least.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.167
Okay, fine. What do you want?

12:46.542 --> 12:48.875
My darling wife, speak up.

12:52.292 --> 12:55.458
We want to go to Panaji.

12:57.208 --> 13:00.000
-Why?
-For shopping.

13:01.792 --> 13:03.333
We just went shopping six months ago.

13:05.208 --> 13:06.208
Yes, we did.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.958
You bought the cheapest clothes
to save money.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.833
Their colors have faded,
within six months.

13:11.375 --> 13:14.333
So, this time, let's shop here,
instead of going to Panaji.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.792
No, we want to go to Panaji.

13:18.083 --> 13:21.500
We don't just want to go shopping.
We also want to watch a movie.

13:21.875 --> 13:24.292
And we want to eat a pizza, too.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.083
-And ice cream?
-Yes, ice cream, too!

13:30.750 --> 13:32.917
People do all sorts of things
for their family!

13:33.292 --> 13:34.292
What do you do?

13:34.792 --> 13:37.958
-You can't even buy us an ice cream!
-Don't be so absurd!

13:38.583 --> 13:40.292
You can buy ice cream at Martin's, too!

13:40.458 --> 13:43.000
-What's so special about Panaji?
-You're denying our wishes, correct?

13:43.792 --> 13:46.500
Majority wins and you're still saying no!

13:47.333 --> 13:50.333
-We shall see.
-I didn't say no.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.167
I just asked.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.125
-Does that mean we're going to Panaji?
-Yes.

13:55.708 --> 13:58.375
-Are you sure?
-This Sunday we are going to Panaji.

13:58.625 --> 13:59.750
Happy?

16:13.042 --> 16:15.333
There's a nature camp next week.

16:15.750 --> 16:19.542
Two students from each school in Goa
are selected.

16:20.083 --> 16:23.208
And I've been selected from my school.

16:24.083 --> 16:27.250
-That's really nice.
-Yes, but...

16:27.333 --> 16:29.750
-I've told her, she can't go.
-Why?

16:30.917 --> 16:32.500
She should go for a nature camp.

16:32.583 --> 16:35.708
Nandini, real knowledge is not only found
in books.

16:35.875 --> 16:38.417
You have to visit new places for that.
You have to meet different people.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.750
You have to experience new things.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.833
In that case, why don't you pay the fees?

16:44.625 --> 16:46.750
-The fees?
-Around 1800 rupees.

16:51.667 --> 16:55.000
Real knowledge is only found in books.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.792
What? You just said yes!

16:59.083 --> 17:00.500
You can't go back on your word!

17:01.375 --> 17:05.625
Please, let me do this. Please, papa.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.833
-Okay, fine.
-Thank you!

18:50.208 --> 18:52.250
Mr. Vijay, it's been so long.

18:52.583 --> 18:53.833
-How are you, Rajesh?
-Fine.

18:53.917 --> 18:55.375
-How is the social work going on?
-Well...

18:55.583 --> 18:57.958
There's more politics
than social work involved.

18:58.167 --> 19:01.208
Right, our group has established
a political party.

19:02.792 --> 19:05.333
-I'm working on that.
-What's that in your hand?

19:06.208 --> 19:09.458
There is a stone quarry
about 15 km away in Paavelim.

19:09.708 --> 19:10.875
I mean, it was there earlier.

19:10.958 --> 19:12.667
We shut it down
after protesting against it.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.917
-Why?
-The project is not eco-friendly.

19:16.375 --> 19:18.417
There is a lake right
in the middle of the quarry.

19:18.708 --> 19:19.750
Have a look.

19:20.042 --> 19:21.458
All right, I've got to leave.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.875
-See you.
-Bye, Sis!

19:25.750 --> 19:29.917
So, as I was saying,
the girls are growing up.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.125
They are smart, too.
They should get into a good school.

19:33.542 --> 19:34.792
-For example...
-St. Thomas.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.667
Yes, St. Thomas.

19:37.250 --> 19:40.042
I've heard very good things
about that school.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.417
From whom? From Nandini, right?

19:44.458 --> 19:47.750
-Yes, I told her. So what?
-I knew it.

19:47.833 --> 19:49.667
Only you can come up
with such an uneducated idea.

19:49.750 --> 19:53.042
Who are you calling uneducated?
I'm more educated than you.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.875
Right, you've got a doctorate.

19:55.042 --> 19:56.500
I admit, I only studied
till the tenth grade.

19:56.792 --> 19:58.000
But at least, I cleared the exams!

19:58.542 --> 20:00.167
I didn't fail in the fourth grade,
like you did.

20:00.708 --> 20:01.833
That's where you're wrong.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.667
Clearing papers doesn't teach you
everything.

20:04.167 --> 20:05.542
-What?
-You bet!

20:06.167 --> 20:08.667
Once it took me four whole hours
to explain to her

20:08.750 --> 20:11.125
Sonu Nigam's brother isn't called
Telephone Nigam.

20:11.208 --> 20:12.792
She just wouldn't believe me.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.375
Just keep quiet! You always--

20:15.458 --> 20:17.875
Listen, please don't get
into another fight the both of you!

20:18.250 --> 20:20.833
You don't need to go to St. Thomas
to know all that.

20:20.917 --> 20:23.667
At least, don't scrimp
when it comes to education.

20:24.167 --> 20:25.750
I'm not scrimping.
I'm being sensible.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.792
It's not necessary everything
that is expensive is good.

20:28.208 --> 20:32.167
Besides, who really wish to study,
the can at any school and make it big.

20:32.542 --> 20:33.917
Am I right, Father-in-law?

20:34.708 --> 20:37.250
Yes, my son. You're absolutely right.

20:40.958 --> 20:42.125
Get it moving, quickly.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.833
-Hello, Rane!
-Hello, Uncle Martin! How are you?

20:44.958 --> 20:46.208
-Okay.
-What brings you here?

20:46.917 --> 20:48.792
-So, the work has begun.
-Yes, it'll be done soon.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.458
Are you done with the collections?

21:07.542 --> 21:08.625
Yes, you bet!

21:08.708 --> 21:11.250
What about D'costa
and Bandodkar's complaints?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.458
Yes, I'm on my way there.

21:13.667 --> 21:15.458
-Then, leave!
-Of course, I'll go.

21:15.958 --> 21:17.625
-I really want you to leave!
-Yes.

21:17.833 --> 21:19.583
Let me finish my special tea.

21:20.625 --> 21:21.833
-Where is it?
-Here...

21:24.625 --> 21:28.250
Hey, Peter! Where is my special tea?

21:28.917 --> 21:32.167
-You!
-No! Behind you, sir! I'm leaving!

21:32.667 --> 21:34.542
-Hey!
-Crazy!

21:36.000 --> 21:37.958
-Is he crazy?
-What's the matter, Vijay?

21:38.750 --> 21:40.167
He's getting too smart for his own good.

21:41.042 --> 21:42.667
Forget about it. He's a kid.

21:43.125 --> 21:46.833
Listen, Mr. Rane,
this is Mr. Vijay Salgaonkar.

21:47.625 --> 21:50.958
-He owns Mirage Cable.
-Really? That's nice.

21:51.042 --> 21:52.368
This is contractor Rane.

21:52.568 --> 21:54.389
He is working on the construction
of the police station.

21:54.489 --> 21:55.625
Okay, do come in.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.208
-After you.
-Sit down.

22:05.375 --> 22:08.542
Uncle Martin said you need
to get some odd jobs done.

22:09.375 --> 22:11.417
-I have a...
-Hey, Martin!

22:11.708 --> 22:14.250
I asked you if that old couple came over
the other day.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.625
You said no! You think I am some...?

22:18.292 --> 22:20.375
I know they came here.

22:20.625 --> 22:24.333
Some smart chap taught them
a few legal lessons.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.208
What the heck!

22:26.417 --> 22:29.458
What are you saying?
I don't remember anything.

22:29.708 --> 22:32.667
Really? So, your memory is failing.

22:32.917 --> 22:35.208
Or are you trying to protect
that wise guy?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.292
Listen, I'm an old man.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.542
Right, old man.

22:44.583 --> 22:47.333
So, Vijay. Do you remember the old couple?

22:48.417 --> 22:49.458
Which old couple?

22:52.792 --> 22:57.333
-Peter, what's on the menu today?
-The usual.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.375
What is this, Uncle?
You should have a today's special!

23:01.833 --> 23:03.500
I'm fed up of eating
the same food every day.

23:05.458 --> 23:07.042
-I am bored, too.
-See?

23:07.458 --> 23:10.083
But normally my customers pay
for their meals later.

23:10.667 --> 23:13.792
Some of them even eat free of cost.

23:14.167 --> 23:15.250
Right.

23:16.875 --> 23:18.250
For example, Vijay.

23:20.542 --> 23:22.167
I don't pay for my meals later.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.208
I clear my bills every week.

23:27.583 --> 23:30.750
So, that means you're taunting me, Uncle.

23:30.917 --> 23:35.000
-No! Just talking in general.
-No, let's settle your account today.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.042
Why do you keep going on and on
about money?

23:38.417 --> 23:39.792
What will you do with all that money?

23:40.583 --> 23:42.875
I'll put a today's special on the menu.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.542
Really? How much do I owe you?

23:49.000 --> 23:51.333
-Forget about it, sir.
-Take it, Uncle.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.750
When a cop offers to pay,
you should take it at once.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.250
Just keep your nose out of this.

23:57.708 --> 24:00.083
Cheeky fellow! We're having it out here.

24:00.750 --> 24:02.583
So, how much do I owe you?
Don't feel shy, tell me.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.417
About 3542 rupees.

24:04.792 --> 24:08.167
You remember that number really well,
but you don't remember that old couple!

24:08.667 --> 24:12.250
-I write my accounts down, you see.
-Okay, fine.

24:13.250 --> 24:15.750
Then 3542 rupees. That's it?

24:16.292 --> 24:18.542
Cheapskate, 3600 rupees.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.500
Let's make it a round figure.

24:21.292 --> 24:22.708
I'm going to settle it right away.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.167
Uncle, let's just assume...

24:24.625 --> 24:26.667
you've paid me 3600 rupees
as commission.

24:27.083 --> 24:28.333
What's the commission for?

24:29.792 --> 24:30.958
Don't you see that right in front?

24:31.417 --> 24:33.750
The new police station
is being constructed.

24:34.125 --> 24:37.250
So, all the workers come here to eat food.

24:37.750 --> 24:40.292
Why? Thanks to me.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.458
Look at that!
Contractor Rane is sitting here, too.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.167
What's up, Rane?

24:45.875 --> 24:47.750
I have given you so many customers...

24:48.458 --> 24:50.333
so, I should get paid a commission
for that, Uncle.

24:52.042 --> 24:53.792
These days, at our police station,

24:54.208 --> 24:56.417
we are observing
'the police is your friend' week.

25:03.708 --> 25:05.958
The police really know how to eat well.

25:06.333 --> 25:07.750
At least, work out a bit.

25:08.583 --> 25:09.958
What's your problem?

25:14.542 --> 25:16.250
There is no other hotel around here,
except this one.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.458
That's why the construction workers
come here to eat.

25:19.917 --> 25:21.333
You're not needed for that.

25:22.083 --> 25:23.333
I am a cop.

25:23.708 --> 25:25.625
I can stop them from coming here.

25:30.875 --> 25:32.583
Peter, get Mr. Sawant some coffee.

25:34.250 --> 25:36.042
Vijay, how are you doing?

25:38.125 --> 25:39.250
We were working out a deal.

25:39.667 --> 25:42.125
-We just settled on the commission.
-What's the commission for?

25:42.958 --> 25:46.375
For the meals of the construction workers
at the new police station.

25:46.958 --> 25:48.125
Who is taking a commission?

25:52.750 --> 25:55.250
-Mr. Sawant, coffee.
-Yes.

25:56.917 --> 25:59.417
Mr. Sawant, I know
I should not be saying this.

26:00.458 --> 26:02.125
What's the meaning of the friendly week?

26:03.542 --> 26:06.917
It's the duty of the police to be friendly
and help the public.

26:08.042 --> 26:10.292
Then, why is it being done for a week
in the whole year?

26:11.750 --> 26:12.917
You're right, Vijay.

26:13.875 --> 26:18.208
But, while the people are scared
to file complaints, it's impossible.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.083
That's why we're doing all this.

26:20.833 --> 26:22.000
It will sort itself out gradually.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.792
But all police officers aren't like you.

26:27.375 --> 26:29.792
Some are big, black bed bugs...

26:30.167 --> 26:31.792
who can only feed off
other people's blood.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.667
-What are you doing?
-I'm digging a pit for the compost.

26:54.292 --> 26:55.542
You know what?

26:55.917 --> 26:57.625
Compost and speed post are
two different things.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.292
I know what compost means.

26:59.667 --> 27:04.000
If you bury dry leaves and organic garbage
for six months,

27:04.125 --> 27:05.417
it turns into fertilizer.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.167
I learnt that in school.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.500
I just came to tell you

27:11.667 --> 27:13.625
that next weekend
on 2nd and 3rd October,

27:13.708 --> 27:16.042
Swami Chinmayanand is holding
a sermon in Panaji.

27:16.833 --> 27:18.750
-So?
-We should go!

27:18.833 --> 27:21.167
-It's been a year since we heard him.
-You go ahead.

27:21.417 --> 27:23.875
-Either we go together or nobody does.
-Mom!

27:24.189 --> 27:25.667
-I won't spare you! Mom can't save you.
-Mom!

27:25.750 --> 27:27.167
-Come here.
-No! Mom!

27:27.250 --> 27:28.375
-Come here!
-Anju.

27:28.958 --> 27:30.708
We spent so much to send you
on a nature camp.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.333
You didn't tell us about it.

27:33.125 --> 27:35.583
It was great fun!
There were students from 40 schools.

27:35.667 --> 27:38.458
We went sightseeing, had a bonfire,
we sang songs.

27:38.708 --> 27:39.792
And we had a lot of fun.

27:40.375 --> 27:42.125
There were kids from VIP families, too.

27:43.083 --> 27:44.667
One of them was called Sam.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.708
He used to keep shooting videos of girls
with his phone.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.500
-Did he shoot you, too?
-Yes.

27:50.583 --> 27:52.042
Why didn't you complain?

27:52.125 --> 27:55.500
Later, an advocate's daughter scolded him.

27:55.792 --> 27:57.125
Then, he stopped it.

27:57.292 --> 27:58.417
Which school was he from?

28:11.417 --> 28:13.125
-Is this an old construction?
-Yes.

28:13.583 --> 28:15.792
No wonder the foundation has crumbled.

28:16.583 --> 28:19.000
Don't worry, it will get done.
It'll be just a working day.

28:19.792 --> 28:21.625
-Do it whenever you have time.
-Okay.

28:21.792 --> 28:24.542
The slab laying work at the police station
is done.

28:24.917 --> 28:26.792
I have to start the flooring from Monday.

28:27.042 --> 28:29.417
So, once that's done,
we'll get this done. Okay?

28:29.792 --> 28:30.958
Okay, thank you.

28:33.667 --> 28:35.250
Just let me know about the money.

28:35.333 --> 28:36.772
I'd have taken the money
from any other guy.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.167
Mr. Rane, I'm sorry.

28:38.583 --> 28:40.333
I have taken your money.

28:40.667 --> 28:42.375
I will pay it back gradually.

28:42.667 --> 28:44.417
Just give me a few days.

28:45.667 --> 28:50.125
What the heck, Rane?
You think, you're too smart!

28:50.375 --> 28:53.000
Did you get taken in
by some uneducated fool?

28:53.792 --> 28:57.625
Do you think you'll be safe
if you complain to Mr. Prabhu about me?

28:58.208 --> 29:01.125
The money I have taken from you,

29:01.583 --> 29:04.583
included his cut, too.
Do you get that?

29:05.917 --> 29:07.083
He complained about me!

29:08.167 --> 29:11.375
If you do that again,
I'll make sure you pack up!

29:13.125 --> 29:16.083
Who are you threatening?
I know Mr. Prabhu really well.

29:16.875 --> 29:19.542
-He isn't like you.
-Why are you asking me?

29:19.833 --> 29:22.208
I don't have to ask, we all know you.

29:22.917 --> 29:25.292
Listen, Vijay.
I've had enough of your sass.

29:25.542 --> 29:27.542
-Just zip it.
-Why should I?

29:27.917 --> 29:30.500
Everyone knows you feed off more
on money, than you eat food.

29:30.875 --> 29:33.667
-What the heck...?
-Hey, Gaitonde! Stop!

29:34.042 --> 29:36.875
Okay, let me go!

29:41.708 --> 29:42.875
I won't spare you, Vijay.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.417
We will settle up later.

29:46.417 --> 29:47.417
I'll have my day.

29:50.542 --> 29:51.958
Every dog has his day.

29:59.083 --> 30:02.000
He came so defiantly,
but he's leaving like a mouse!

30:02.458 --> 30:04.750
Vijay, don't get into trouble over me.

30:05.292 --> 30:06.792
I will do the job and leave.

30:07.083 --> 30:09.042
He's going to harass you later
for no reason.

30:09.750 --> 30:11.167
Vijay, Gaitonde is a cop.

30:11.417 --> 30:16.625
-He has power. Don't mess with him.
-I didn't mess with him. And I didn't lie.

30:17.292 --> 30:18.917
Why are we so scared of cops?

30:19.417 --> 30:21.042
They are meant to serve us
and not the opposite.

30:36.458 --> 30:37.458
Very good.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.583
Four hundred fifty-one.

31:02.042 --> 31:03.625
Four hundred fifty-two.

31:03.792 --> 31:04.875
Jose?

31:05.500 --> 31:07.167
I've got a headache.
I'm going home, understood?

31:08.833 --> 31:10.083
He doesn't understand a thing.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.167
If it's Sunny Leone,
you're bound to get a headache.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.375
Dr. Joshi...

31:14.583 --> 31:16.250
Rascal, he understands everything.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.750
Sometimes, I wonder.

31:28.708 --> 31:32.625
Okay, who made you wonder today?

31:34.625 --> 31:37.708
-Let's go in, I'll tell you.
-No, tell me or I won't let you in.

31:38.333 --> 31:39.875
-Come on, you can't do that.
-Tell me.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.083
Sunny Leone, right?

31:45.125 --> 31:48.000
Jism 2 or Jackpot?

31:49.625 --> 31:50.625
Jackpot.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.667
You're now a dad,
but you still act like a kid.

32:02.583 --> 32:04.542
I'm not a kid. I'm young!

32:25.500 --> 32:28.750
Dad, did you come home last night?

32:29.292 --> 32:30.833
-Yes, dear.
-Why?

32:31.750 --> 32:33.375
Anu, don't ask nosy questions.

32:34.167 --> 32:37.750
Why? Dad comes home very rarely,
so I asked.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.708
Don't ask too many questions.
Don't you have to go to school?

32:40.875 --> 32:42.292
You're not even wearing your uniform yet.

32:42.542 --> 32:44.208
Come on, Dad!
How could you forget?

32:44.292 --> 32:46.333
-What?
-It's a holiday today.

32:46.583 --> 32:48.250
Did the school declare that,
or did you do that?

32:49.417 --> 32:51.792
Our daughters make excuses expertly.

32:52.042 --> 32:53.958
It's Sunday tomorrow.
Why do you have a holiday today?

32:54.417 --> 32:55.625
It's Gandhi Jayanti today.

32:56.667 --> 32:58.667
So? Go and study.

32:59.042 --> 33:00.667
No, Dad. I am going to play.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.542
These kids...

33:07.042 --> 33:08.292
Won't you bathe, today?

33:10.333 --> 33:11.500
I don't want to.

33:12.333 --> 33:14.250
So, who is going to work?

33:15.458 --> 33:16.583
I don't know.

33:18.292 --> 33:19.583
I ran out of stamina yesterday.

33:23.083 --> 33:24.417
I mean, that...

33:25.500 --> 33:28.708
my bike broke down on the way.
So, I had to push it home.

33:28.958 --> 33:30.083
I got tired.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.083
Anju?

33:33.208 --> 33:35.833
I'll give you a list.
Get some things from the market.

33:36.250 --> 33:38.583
Okay. Can I go in the evening, please?

33:38.750 --> 33:40.625
All right, but don't forget.

33:53.208 --> 33:56.792
Anju, do you remember me? It's Sam.

33:57.500 --> 34:02.083
Yes, I do. But, what are you doing here?

34:02.417 --> 34:06.000
Me? I came to meet you.

34:06.667 --> 34:07.875
Me?

34:08.708 --> 34:09.708
Why?

34:13.292 --> 34:14.458
Finish it. Okay?

34:16.625 --> 34:17.958
-See who is at the door.
-Okay.

34:20.625 --> 34:21.833
Hi, Anju.

34:43.417 --> 34:45.833
Don't worry,
I didn't show this video to anyone.

34:46.292 --> 34:49.417
In fact, I'm thinking of deleting it.

34:50.875 --> 34:51.917
You want that, too, right?

34:53.083 --> 34:55.958
Great! Make my wish come true.

34:58.042 --> 35:00.625
Tonight at 23:00, behind your house.

35:01.458 --> 35:02.500
You'll meet me, right?

35:03.458 --> 35:05.250
No! I won't come there.

35:05.417 --> 35:08.042
I didn't show this video to anyone,
not even my friends.

35:08.750 --> 35:11.708
I didn't forward it or think
of uploading it on the net.

35:13.750 --> 35:17.000
But, just think about it.
What if I do all that?

35:18.125 --> 35:19.500
What about your family's reputation?

35:24.375 --> 35:27.542
Please, delete this video.
Why are you hassling me? Please!

35:27.750 --> 35:30.042
I will do it. Tonight at 23:00.

35:30.375 --> 35:31.500
Behind your house.

35:32.167 --> 35:33.667
Alone, all right?

35:35.333 --> 35:36.333
No, Sam!

35:59.875 --> 36:00.917
What is it?

36:01.667 --> 36:03.125
I've a slight headache.

36:03.417 --> 36:04.458
Do you want some medicine?

36:04.792 --> 36:07.333
No, I'll be fine
once I lie down for a bit.

36:07.458 --> 36:09.458
Eat something. It's almost dinner time.

36:23.375 --> 36:25.208
-Run!
-No!

36:26.250 --> 36:27.333
Run!

36:29.083 --> 36:32.125
-It seems a storm is coming.
-Hey, don't jinx it!

36:33.417 --> 36:35.125
-I'm leaving.
-Got an umbrella?

36:36.375 --> 36:37.417
Yes.

37:12.042 --> 37:13.333
Anju, you shouldn't have done this.

37:14.250 --> 37:15.792
I guess you aren't taking me seriously.

37:17.250 --> 37:20.458
Sam, please! Don't harass me anymore.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.375
-Please, delete the video.
-Should I delete it?

37:24.167 --> 37:25.333
You cheated me.

37:26.250 --> 37:27.375
Just you wait.

37:28.292 --> 37:29.792
Why are you doing this?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.417
We didn't harm you in any way.

37:32.833 --> 37:34.292
I request you...

37:35.500 --> 37:37.208
don't ruin her life.

37:37.583 --> 37:38.625
It's no use now.

37:39.125 --> 37:42.458
She was ruined the day I shot this video.

37:44.750 --> 37:45.833
You've seen it today.

37:47.250 --> 37:49.708
Soon everyone will watch it
on the Internet.

37:51.417 --> 37:54.042
They'll know how she bathes.

37:58.208 --> 37:59.708
I request you.

38:00.417 --> 38:01.917
Please delete it.

38:02.417 --> 38:03.458
I won't.

38:04.917 --> 38:06.375
Don't you have any shame?

38:07.833 --> 38:09.500
-Delete it.
-No.

38:10.500 --> 38:13.500
-Please, delete it.
-I told you I won't do it.

38:40.208 --> 38:43.625
I beg you. Please, delete it.

38:46.667 --> 38:50.333
We'll be ruined, please!

38:54.500 --> 38:55.542
All right.

38:56.958 --> 38:59.292
I will delete the video.

39:00.667 --> 39:04.083
But you must give me what I want.

39:06.167 --> 39:07.292
What?

39:24.750 --> 39:25.750
Anju?

39:27.958 --> 39:29.125
Nandini!

39:30.875 --> 39:32.042
Anju!

39:33.250 --> 39:34.250
An--

39:42.917 --> 39:45.042
Anju, what happened?

39:47.958 --> 39:49.042
Nandini, what happened?

39:51.458 --> 39:52.958
Why doesn't someone tell me?

40:01.417 --> 40:03.625
I will delete the video.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.083
But, you must give me...

40:10.958 --> 40:12.042
what I want.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.333
Or I will...

40:26.500 --> 40:27.667
upload this video online.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.625
Anju!

40:58.292 --> 41:01.042
Anju, he's not breathing!

41:46.125 --> 41:48.833
-What happened?
-Mom, I can't get through to Dad.

41:48.917 --> 41:50.208
I guess the line is dead.

41:52.083 --> 41:53.458
Let's go, come with me!

42:51.167 --> 42:53.250
Anju, get the spade.

43:52.708 --> 43:55.583
-What will we do now?
-I don't know.

43:57.792 --> 44:00.833
I don't know
how I got the courage to bury him.

44:03.083 --> 44:05.000
But I'm shaking all over now.

44:06.833 --> 44:08.667
Did I make a mistake by burying him?

44:10.375 --> 44:11.458
No.

44:12.208 --> 44:13.292
You did the right thing.

44:14.167 --> 44:17.417
If we had informed the police at once...

44:18.250 --> 44:19.458
we wouldn't feel scared.

44:19.625 --> 44:21.083
If we'd gone to the police,

44:22.708 --> 44:24.458
Anju's life would be ruined.

44:26.167 --> 44:27.583
I'm really scared.

44:31.625 --> 44:34.750
Don't be scared.
I won't let anything happen to you.

44:35.958 --> 44:38.917
See what I found in the outhouse.

44:40.708 --> 44:45.083
-Did Sam have a car?
-Yes, he had a yellow car.

44:47.125 --> 44:48.875
He must have parked it nearby.

44:50.208 --> 44:51.667
Have you checked the outhouse properly?

44:52.667 --> 44:53.750
-No.
-No.

44:54.375 --> 44:55.583
Let's go.

45:04.833 --> 45:07.875
Where did Sam fall when you hit him?

45:08.750 --> 45:09.833
Right there.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.500
What are you searching for?

45:20.583 --> 45:23.500
Blood.
There's not a single drop of blood here.

45:25.458 --> 45:28.583
When you hit him with the stick,
did you hit his head?

45:32.083 --> 45:33.792
Perhaps it's an internal injury.

45:34.667 --> 45:36.333
We have to clean the outhouse thoroughly.

45:49.917 --> 45:51.083
Just a moment.

45:56.875 --> 45:58.958
Trace it, quickly!
As soon as the SIM card is put in...

45:59.042 --> 46:01.083
-Trace it fast.
-Trace the location of the SIM card.

46:01.167 --> 46:03.208
-Find out where he's travelling.
-We are getting the signal.

46:03.708 --> 46:05.375
It's really easy to trace his SIM now.

46:06.542 --> 46:08.000
He's talking from the second floor.

46:08.792 --> 46:10.906
Sir, if he speaks for five minutes,
we'll have the exact location.

46:11.011 --> 46:12.958
The SIM card has been activated.
So, the exact location...

46:13.042 --> 46:15.958
-Trace the SIM card.
-Sir, it's within a half kilometer radius.

46:16.083 --> 46:17.500
I guess he threw the mobile away.

46:17.958 --> 46:20.625
Sir, he's traveling via Rajasthan
to Haryana.

46:33.917 --> 46:36.875
Don't leave the house until I get back.

46:37.708 --> 46:39.042
Don't call anyone.

46:39.625 --> 46:41.250
Keep the doors and windows locked.

46:42.958 --> 46:44.708
It should appear as if no one is at home.

46:45.583 --> 46:46.792
Where are you going?

46:47.167 --> 46:49.292
I have to find the car
and take it somewhere else.

46:49.458 --> 46:50.833
Get back soon.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.625
-Anju...
-I didn't mean to kill Sam.

46:58.042 --> 47:01.125
I was just trying to break his phone.

47:01.542 --> 47:04.375
-But, he didn't let go...
-I know!

47:05.125 --> 47:07.250
I don't want to go to prison, please.

47:07.708 --> 47:08.833
Are you crazy?

47:10.125 --> 47:11.333
I'm still alive.

47:12.375 --> 47:13.708
I won't let you go to jail.

47:15.208 --> 47:16.458
Nothing will happen to you.

47:30.417 --> 47:33.667
Salvi, stop counting
and give all of that to me.

47:39.250 --> 47:41.833
Is that all you've got?

47:42.208 --> 47:43.917
Sir, isn't 500 rupees enough?

47:48.917 --> 47:52.500
It's not for a driver's license.
This is for passport verification.

47:53.625 --> 47:55.458
You want to go to London
to meet your son, right?

48:03.208 --> 48:05.125
-How much for you?
-Sir, it's 55.

48:05.708 --> 48:08.208
Do you think it's raining money?
55 it seems!

48:15.000 --> 48:16.667
Here, that's 30.

48:17.167 --> 48:18.375
Get going.

48:19.042 --> 48:20.083
All right, then.

48:20.625 --> 48:22.583
Get me a gift from London.

48:28.292 --> 48:29.500
What the heck? Who is it?

48:39.542 --> 48:42.125
-Isn't that Vijay Salgaonkar?
-It seems to be.

48:42.292 --> 48:45.083
-When did he buy a car?
-Where does he live?

48:49.750 --> 48:52.125
His garden is across the road.

49:13.375 --> 49:14.542
Mom.

49:16.542 --> 49:20.750
We'll be in big trouble because of me.

49:23.250 --> 49:24.375
Don't say that.

49:26.042 --> 49:27.292
We are with you.

49:29.167 --> 49:32.875
You don't know whose son he was.

49:34.417 --> 49:35.958
Whose son was he?

50:24.000 --> 50:26.333
Listen, I wanted to tell you

50:26.500 --> 50:28.333
on the next weekend
on the 2nd and 3rd of October,

50:28.417 --> 50:30.750
Swami Chinmayanand is holding
a sermon at Panaji.

50:36.833 --> 50:38.000
Come on now!

50:39.375 --> 50:41.167
Hey, move it!

51:25.917 --> 51:28.000
-Yes, sir?
-Can I buy a phone?

51:28.458 --> 51:30.458
-A new one?
-No, a used phone.

51:30.542 --> 51:31.625
Sure.

51:31.708 --> 51:34.167
-Make sure the battery is fully charged.
-Sure.

51:36.917 --> 51:37.958
Here you are, sir.

51:38.208 --> 51:39.708
-How much for this?
-Ninety hundred rupees.

51:51.917 --> 51:54.292
-Here you are.
-Could you put the SIM card in?

52:05.042 --> 52:06.125
Here you are, sir.

52:12.125 --> 52:15.042
-How do I reduce the volume?
-Here.

52:17.208 --> 52:18.250
It's done, sir.

53:43.542 --> 53:46.583
There is a stone quarry
about 15 km away in Paavelim.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.375
I mean, it used to be there.

53:48.458 --> 53:50.208
We got it shut down,
after protesting against it.

53:53.750 --> 53:55.333
There is a lake right in the middle of it.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.500
But the project is not eco-friendly.

56:14.042 --> 56:16.292
It's you! I thought you'd taken a holiday.

56:16.958 --> 56:18.917
-What happened today?
-Nothing much.

56:19.167 --> 56:20.125
I collected the payments.

56:20.208 --> 56:22.417
As always, Mrs. Pereira avoided
making the payment.

56:24.083 --> 56:25.583
Okay, listen to me.

56:26.292 --> 56:29.167
I am not here for 2 days.
I am going to Panaji for a sermon.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.250
Sermons?

56:32.042 --> 56:33.375
Nandini really wants to go.

56:34.500 --> 56:37.083
We are leaving, tomorrow.
Take care of things.

56:38.417 --> 56:39.417
Mr. Vijay...

56:41.625 --> 56:42.792
Anything wrong?

56:44.833 --> 56:48.708
-Not at all. Why?
-You just seem slightly 'off'. That's all.

56:51.583 --> 56:53.042
Not at all!

56:53.333 --> 56:55.750
But if I find out you've messed up,

56:56.083 --> 56:58.458
-I'll rub you out!
-Now that's more like you.

56:58.708 --> 57:00.792
Get lost.
Don't screen too many adult films.

57:01.667 --> 57:02.875
Sure.

57:30.125 --> 57:32.167
-Who is it?
-It's Vijay.

57:44.708 --> 57:47.000
Don't cry, dear. I'm back.

57:48.208 --> 57:51.458
Dad, don't ever leave me again.

57:51.875 --> 57:54.250
-I won't.
-Vijay...

57:55.875 --> 57:57.417
Sam was the son of the IG of Goa.

58:06.708 --> 58:07.792
You're lying!

58:09.250 --> 58:10.292
Tell me!

58:15.875 --> 58:17.042
Patil!

58:40.708 --> 58:42.667
Senior Inspector D'souza.

58:43.417 --> 58:44.917
And Inspector Mohite.

58:46.583 --> 58:49.042
These are the name
of the suspended officers.

58:51.542 --> 58:52.792
Because of whom?

58:55.833 --> 58:58.000
The court warned the police department.

58:59.958 --> 59:01.375
They may set up an enquiry, too.

59:02.958 --> 59:04.167
Because of whom?

59:06.167 --> 59:09.042
The murderer in this case is roaming
scot free.

59:10.583 --> 59:11.750
Because of whom?

59:13.208 --> 59:18.875
Because both of you testified in court
the police forced you to make a statement.

59:22.583 --> 59:25.250
Do you think
the police department is a joke...

59:27.292 --> 59:29.333
and you can do anything you want?

59:35.667 --> 59:37.625
I want you to give another statement.

59:39.125 --> 59:40.292
This time make it the truth.

59:40.792 --> 59:41.833
No, ma'am.

59:42.500 --> 59:44.125
Ma'am, they will kill us.

59:44.583 --> 59:46.875
They will kill you
and so you won't testify.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.667
And so, both my officers will stay
under suspension.

59:53.750 --> 59:54.792
Patil.

59:56.208 --> 59:58.167
Did anyone see you
when you fetched them?

59:59.167 --> 1:00:00.583
No, Madam. We were in civil clothes.

1:00:05.625 --> 1:00:06.708
All right, then.

1:00:08.625 --> 1:00:10.333
String them both up
with a noose around their necks.

1:00:12.125 --> 1:00:14.875
Anchor them with a heavy stone
and toss them into the sea.

1:00:15.583 --> 1:00:17.792
No one will know.
The corpses won't be found.

1:00:19.125 --> 1:00:21.625
I won't waste my time on them.

1:00:24.917 --> 1:00:26.875
No, ma'am!

1:00:27.250 --> 1:00:28.667
Ma'am, we'll tell the truth!

1:00:29.125 --> 1:00:31.833
Ma'am, they are innocent.
We will tell the truth.

1:00:33.875 --> 1:00:36.750
Patil, when they come to testify
in the court,

1:00:36.958 --> 1:00:38.500
bring in their families.

1:00:38.708 --> 1:00:39.750
Okay, ma'am.

1:00:39.875 --> 1:00:43.208
If they give a false testimony,
maim their families.

1:01:24.583 --> 1:01:25.708
Why are you smiling?

1:01:26.167 --> 1:01:28.333
-Aren't you tensed?
-About what?

1:01:28.833 --> 1:01:30.958
-That boy...
-Which boy?

1:01:33.083 --> 1:01:34.083
Who is Sam?

1:01:34.625 --> 1:01:36.417
-The one who--
-Just a moment.

1:01:38.750 --> 1:01:40.167
I don't know anyone called Sam.

1:01:41.375 --> 1:01:43.042
And no boy entered this house.

1:01:44.375 --> 1:01:46.208
From now on,
we are going to react just like that.

1:01:46.667 --> 1:01:47.958
As if nothing happened.

1:01:48.542 --> 1:01:51.792
Or the fear and tension may cause
problems for us.

1:01:53.625 --> 1:01:56.708
I just realized that a while back.

1:01:57.458 --> 1:01:59.083
Before I arrived home,
I went to the office.

1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:01.792
Jose asked me if anything was wrong.

1:02:03.833 --> 1:02:07.250
If Jose can figure out something is wrong
in a few moments,

1:02:08.250 --> 1:02:10.125
then others can figure it out, too.

1:02:11.625 --> 1:02:14.875
When I answered him as I normally do,
he was assured.

1:02:16.292 --> 1:02:18.667
So, forget what happened.

1:02:19.458 --> 1:02:22.167
Behave as if nothing has happened.

1:02:22.583 --> 1:02:23.750
Everything is normal.

1:02:24.250 --> 1:02:27.333
What did you do about the car?

1:02:27.583 --> 1:02:29.750
I won't tell you stuff...

1:02:30.583 --> 1:02:31.792
that you don't need to know about.

1:02:32.208 --> 1:02:33.958
Don't even try to find out.

1:02:37.292 --> 1:02:39.875
Pack your bags.
We leave tomorrow morning.

1:02:41.250 --> 1:02:42.292
Where to?

1:02:42.458 --> 1:02:44.042
We have to stay somewhere else
for two days.

1:02:45.458 --> 1:02:47.875
It'll be a good change and help us relax.

1:02:49.583 --> 1:02:51.625
If anyone asks you where we're going,
tell them...

1:02:52.917 --> 1:02:54.917
we are going to attend
Swami Chinmayanand's sermon.

1:02:56.042 --> 1:02:57.708
But that got over today.

1:03:19.750 --> 1:03:21.042
-Hello!
-Hi, Mahesh.

1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:24.625
-Are you going back or...
-Yes, I'll freshen up and go back.

1:03:26.042 --> 1:03:27.542
Meera, did you speak to Sam?

1:03:28.125 --> 1:03:30.125
I try to call since last night.
His phone is switched off.

1:03:31.667 --> 1:03:33.958
You call him constantly
and bother him, Mahesh.

1:03:34.042 --> 1:03:36.458
So, he must have switched it off
on purpose.

1:03:36.542 --> 1:03:39.083
That's nice.
You're scolding me for all my trouble.

1:03:39.792 --> 1:03:41.500
You've allowed him to take
too many liberties.

1:03:43.417 --> 1:03:47.875
Mahesh, kids want freedom at this age.
We must give it to them.

1:03:48.208 --> 1:03:51.042
Freedom? How much freedom does he want?

1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:52.625
We have given him everything.

1:03:52.792 --> 1:03:55.958
A phone, laptop, two credit cards, a car.
Why does he need all that?

1:03:56.750 --> 1:04:00.125
Did you see last month's credit card bill?
60,000 rupees.

1:04:00.833 --> 1:04:02.875
Yes, that's because he bought
a new laptop.

1:04:03.375 --> 1:04:06.250
-And I've seen the receipt.
-Why does he need another laptop?

1:04:06.792 --> 1:04:08.708
How does the receipt matter?
Did you see the laptop?

1:04:08.875 --> 1:04:09.875
I haven't seen it.

1:04:10.417 --> 1:04:12.542
Mahesh, stop doubting your son so much.

1:04:13.208 --> 1:04:14.583
He'll run away forever someday.

1:04:15.458 --> 1:04:17.250
I don't doubt him.
I worry about him, Meera.

1:04:17.833 --> 1:04:19.833
You're pampered him
to such an extent that...

1:04:21.083 --> 1:04:22.875
Sorry, I'm getting late.

1:04:23.750 --> 1:04:26.375
If you speak to him,
tell him to come home. Okay?

1:04:26.667 --> 1:04:27.667
Bye, Meera.

1:04:41.125 --> 1:04:42.583
All right, tickets, please.

1:04:42.792 --> 1:04:43.917
Mr. Salgaonkar!

1:04:44.417 --> 1:04:46.083
Are you going on a trip with the family?

1:04:47.292 --> 1:04:48.417
Did you buy a new bus?

1:04:48.667 --> 1:04:50.917
-No, it's a used bus.
-It's nice.

1:04:51.292 --> 1:04:52.500
Where are you off to?

1:04:52.917 --> 1:04:55.750
We are going to attend
our spiritual guru's sermon at Panaji.

1:04:56.500 --> 1:04:58.958
-Give me four tickets.
-What's wrong with you?

1:05:00.083 --> 1:05:02.542
I can't let you pay for tickets on my bus.

1:05:03.042 --> 1:05:04.292
Put it away.

1:05:05.167 --> 1:05:09.125
All right, tickets, please!

1:08:48.917 --> 1:08:50.000
What did I say to you?

1:08:51.042 --> 1:08:54.083
-I know, but I can't seem to forget.
-You have to forget.

1:08:55.292 --> 1:08:58.333
Our fear is the one last piece
of evidence of what happened.

1:08:58.917 --> 1:09:02.333
We have to get rid of that as well,
and there's just one more thing.

1:09:02.708 --> 1:09:05.458
Get a bill for everything you buy
from now on.

1:09:06.208 --> 1:09:09.708
Groceries, vegetables, fruits, pencils...
Get bills for the most trivial things.

1:09:37.208 --> 1:09:39.125
Let me speak to Kanvinde
from the cyber cell.

1:11:40.042 --> 1:11:43.417
Ma'am, we followed Sam's network
from Goa, Hublidarbar, Chittadurg,

1:11:43.500 --> 1:11:47.167
Bengaluru, to Tamil Nadu
and we lost trace in Kanchipuram.

1:11:47.792 --> 1:11:49.375
After that, his phone was switched off.

1:11:51.917 --> 1:11:55.000
He has friends in Bengaluru and Chennai.

1:11:55.333 --> 1:11:56.667
Yes, perhaps, he went there.

1:11:56.792 --> 1:11:59.708
But why did the phone get switched off
in Kanchipuram?

1:13:39.208 --> 1:13:40.292
ACP Rego.

1:13:42.708 --> 1:13:44.333
Ma'am, we just found the car here.

1:13:44.625 --> 1:13:45.833
Who saw it first?

1:13:46.125 --> 1:13:48.292
A few kids who were swimming here
found it.

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.417
How many days, do you reckon?

1:13:54.500 --> 1:13:56.500
It's been about two weeks.

1:14:03.792 --> 1:14:05.458
When the car was dumped, it was empty.

1:14:07.792 --> 1:14:10.458
Don't let this get to the media.

1:14:16.208 --> 1:14:17.958
The last call from Sam's mobile...

1:14:18.208 --> 1:14:21.125
was made on 2nd October at 19:12.

1:14:21.708 --> 1:14:24.500
The signal indicates
it was located in Pondolem.

1:14:24.958 --> 1:14:27.875
His phone went out of coverage at 22:30.

1:14:28.750 --> 1:14:29.750
The next morning,

1:14:30.167 --> 1:14:33.750
his phone was switched on once again
at Panaji at 9:25.

1:14:34.125 --> 1:14:38.250
After that, the phone went to Kanchipuram,
where it was switched off.

1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:42.750
Ma'am, given the information
we have so far, I think...

1:14:43.292 --> 1:14:46.208
we should confine
our investigation to Goa.

1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:53.208
Sam spoke to someone
for the last time on 2nd October.

1:14:53.708 --> 1:14:55.875
Get me the details for that number.

1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:00.167
Send him in.

1:15:07.125 --> 1:15:10.250
Ma'am, the account number
you gave us was accessed

1:15:10.333 --> 1:15:14.500
at 10:00 on 2nd October
at a cash ATM in Panaji.

1:15:14.750 --> 1:15:16.125
There is no transaction after that.

1:15:16.417 --> 1:15:18.417
How much cash was withdrawn?

1:15:18.542 --> 1:15:20.500
-Twenty thousand, sir.
-Twenty thousand?

1:15:22.708 --> 1:15:25.750
-Why did he need so much money?
-Sir, there's more.

1:15:26.500 --> 1:15:29.208
The phone which went out of range
on 2nd October

1:15:29.750 --> 1:15:32.667
and the one which was switched on
the morning of 3rd October...

1:15:33.083 --> 1:15:34.375
are two different phones.

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:37.750
The IMEI numbers are different.

1:15:38.708 --> 1:15:43.958
Ma'am, possibly he withdrew cash
to buy a new cell phone.

1:15:45.958 --> 1:15:47.083
I don't think so.

1:15:47.333 --> 1:15:50.542
He bought a new cell phone
just two months ago.

1:15:51.542 --> 1:15:54.000
I think our son is in big trouble.

1:16:06.042 --> 1:16:07.792
Hey, you. What's this?

1:16:10.708 --> 1:16:11.875
The Panchayat building tax.

1:16:12.542 --> 1:16:13.708
I told you to pay that, right?

1:16:15.083 --> 1:16:17.750
-When did I tell you?
-It was...

1:16:18.042 --> 1:16:20.708
-Three weeks ago.
-Three weeks?

1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:24.667
Sameer Deshmukh,
the only son of IG Meera Deshmukh.

1:16:25.125 --> 1:16:26.417
He's been missing since three weeks.

1:16:27.458 --> 1:16:30.542
According to the phone records,
he was in Pondolem on 2nd October.

1:16:33.083 --> 1:16:35.333
This is the car, he drove in here.

1:16:47.375 --> 1:16:49.958
This car was recovered from the lake
at Paavelim Stone Quarry.

1:16:50.333 --> 1:16:52.083
But there is no sign of Sameer.

1:17:13.750 --> 1:17:15.792
If you are facing a problem,
come to me and...

1:17:18.958 --> 1:17:20.042
What's up, Digambar?

1:17:20.500 --> 1:17:22.417
-How is your son now?
-He's fine, sir.

1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:24.125
He will be discharged
within a day or two.

1:17:24.208 --> 1:17:25.292
That's good.

1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:27.958
-Give me 200 rupees.
-I don't have any money.

1:17:28.208 --> 1:17:29.208
What do you mean?

1:17:29.500 --> 1:17:31.417
The hospital isn't treating your son
free of charge.

1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:32.750
-No--
-Come on, out with it.

1:17:32.833 --> 1:17:34.792
-What's in that pocket?
-It's nothing.

1:17:34.875 --> 1:17:36.375
Let's see it! Is that all?

1:17:37.250 --> 1:17:38.875
Fifty rupees? Get going.

1:17:43.417 --> 1:17:45.167
Martin, give me a packet of Pan Masala.

1:17:45.833 --> 1:17:47.542
What? The Pan masala?

1:17:47.917 --> 1:17:49.500
No tea for you today, Mr. Gaitonde?

1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:52.708
No, I don't have time for tea.

1:17:53.417 --> 1:17:55.333
I've been assigned to a major case.

1:17:56.250 --> 1:17:57.292
What is it about?

1:17:57.500 --> 1:17:59.833
A yellow Hyundai Getz car...

1:18:00.500 --> 1:18:02.750
was recovered from the lake
in Paavelim stone quarry.

1:18:11.750 --> 1:18:14.167
That's in Paavelim, right?
Why do you have to get involved?

1:18:14.875 --> 1:18:16.583
It's true but, I can't help it.

1:18:17.292 --> 1:18:19.000
The IG's office called, directly.

1:18:19.625 --> 1:18:22.042
The car belongs to the son of the IG.

1:18:23.500 --> 1:18:26.208
The IG will obviously employ
the entire police force to work.

1:18:27.958 --> 1:18:30.125
Mr. Sawant and I are working
on this case together.

1:18:30.542 --> 1:18:31.708
I'll leave now.

1:18:32.125 --> 1:18:33.167
What do you care?

1:18:38.875 --> 1:18:39.875
Mr. Sawant.

1:18:49.750 --> 1:18:52.750
-What's wrong? Everything okay?
-Yes, of course.

1:18:53.042 --> 1:18:54.333
Gaitonde, don't shoot your mouth off.

1:18:55.125 --> 1:18:58.042
Don't drag Vijay into this
because you have issues with him.

1:18:58.167 --> 1:19:02.125
I saw him getting into the car.
It's just--

1:19:07.542 --> 1:19:08.708
That's not all.

1:19:09.125 --> 1:19:12.583
A little while ago, I mentioned the car.
He was disturbed.

1:19:13.292 --> 1:19:17.583
You'll see he is slightly apprehensive,
he will look back.

1:19:29.042 --> 1:19:30.083
He's going to turn now.

1:19:44.625 --> 1:19:45.625
So, now what?

1:19:48.042 --> 1:19:49.458
You've lost it, Gaitonde.

1:19:53.375 --> 1:19:56.292
Vijay Salgaonkar and the IG's son,
Sameer Deshmukh.

1:19:56.792 --> 1:19:57.708
What's the connection?

1:19:58.083 --> 1:20:00.375
Gaitonde and Vijay can't stand each other.

1:20:01.042 --> 1:20:03.333
That's why Gaitonde is trying
to implicate Vijay.

1:20:03.875 --> 1:20:06.000
Or he is mistaken.

1:20:11.583 --> 1:20:13.792
Sir, on the 3rd of this month at 7:15,

1:20:14.292 --> 1:20:16.833
I went to Subhash Salvi's place
for passport verification.

1:20:18.667 --> 1:20:20.833
I saw Vijay Salgaonkar there.

1:20:22.625 --> 1:20:23.833
I am absolutely sure.

1:20:25.208 --> 1:20:27.250
Where were you on the afternoon
of the 2nd of this month?

1:20:28.292 --> 1:20:30.167
We went for a sermon to Panaji.

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.708
-When did you get back?
-The next day, on a Sunday.

1:20:34.292 --> 1:20:37.000
-At what time?
-In the evening.

1:20:37.708 --> 1:20:39.417
-Where was the sermon held?
-In Panaji.

1:20:39.708 --> 1:20:40.833
Where, in Panaji?

1:20:43.292 --> 1:20:44.292
Patto...

1:20:46.875 --> 1:20:50.875
-In Patto colony.
-Really? Was it in Patto colony?

1:20:53.958 --> 1:20:56.458
The hermitage is there.
That's where the sermon was held.

1:20:56.750 --> 1:20:58.292
Vijay, what's going on?

1:20:59.167 --> 1:21:00.917
Will the police actually come here?

1:21:02.917 --> 1:21:05.667
We don't know when they will come,
but they will certainly come over.

1:21:06.667 --> 1:21:08.250
But you don't have to worry.

1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:11.417
The police have no clues about Sam.

1:21:12.333 --> 1:21:13.542
They don't have any evidence either.

1:21:14.333 --> 1:21:17.542
But they will try to gather evidence.

1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000
So, they will cross question you.

1:21:22.792 --> 1:21:26.000
Either they will ask nicely
or they will scare you.

1:21:26.625 --> 1:21:30.083
Your mom and I may be beaten up
before you.

1:21:32.083 --> 1:21:35.833
If they don't get the answers they want,
they'll let us go.

1:21:37.500 --> 1:21:39.833
So, no matter what happens,
anything at all...

1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:43.833
you can't change your statement
under any circumstances.

1:21:45.125 --> 1:21:46.417
Just stick to your story.

1:21:48.083 --> 1:21:49.333
Can you both do that?

1:21:51.208 --> 1:21:54.667
Dad, will they beat you
and Mom up very badly?

1:21:56.417 --> 1:21:57.792
Don't think about that.

1:21:59.042 --> 1:22:01.458
When you are naughty,
I hit you too, right?

1:22:02.083 --> 1:22:03.333
That's about it.

1:22:04.583 --> 1:22:05.708
Don't be scared.

1:22:06.542 --> 1:22:08.292
It's late. Go to bed.

1:22:16.750 --> 1:22:20.583
Vijay, how are we going to prove
we weren't here on Saturday?

1:22:21.333 --> 1:22:24.458
Someone must have seen you
at the office or at Martin's corner.

1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:30.750
-Of course, they must have.
-Then what?

1:22:30.875 --> 1:22:32.875
Nandini, what happened to us...

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.083
has left us with only two options.

1:22:37.792 --> 1:22:39.250
Either we give in...

1:22:40.458 --> 1:22:42.000
or we stand up and fight.

1:22:43.208 --> 1:22:45.083
I don't think we've done anything wrong.

1:22:46.417 --> 1:22:48.083
So, there's no way I'm going to give in.

1:22:49.500 --> 1:22:50.750
We will fight.

1:22:51.292 --> 1:22:53.042
Now this is a game.

1:22:54.542 --> 1:22:57.583
We may win, or we may lose.

1:22:59.417 --> 1:23:00.917
But, I can guarantee one thing.

1:23:03.875 --> 1:23:05.083
No matter what happens,

1:23:06.083 --> 1:23:08.458
you or the kids won't go to prison.

1:23:12.583 --> 1:23:15.500
I can't say for sure,
that it was Vijay Salgaonkar.

1:23:15.792 --> 1:23:16.792
Really?

1:23:18.417 --> 1:23:20.250
You said it was Vijay.

1:23:20.333 --> 1:23:25.833
No, when you asked is that Vijay,
I thought, it was probably him.

1:23:25.917 --> 1:23:27.917
But, I can't say for sure
it was him.

1:23:28.042 --> 1:23:29.125
Who did you see?

1:23:29.708 --> 1:23:31.792
Sir, I couldn't see too clearly.

1:23:32.042 --> 1:23:34.125
I can't tell if it was Vijay
or someone else.

1:23:34.292 --> 1:23:36.500
When he mentioned Vijay,
I had a doubt.

1:23:37.292 --> 1:23:38.417
Was that the car?

1:23:39.333 --> 1:23:43.292
It was yellow, like this car.
But I can't say for sure.

1:23:43.625 --> 1:23:46.333
Salvi, there must be something

1:23:46.417 --> 1:23:48.583
-that you can be sure of!?
-Gaitonde!

1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.167
You?

1:23:52.542 --> 1:23:54.625
Sir, I didn't see the license number.

1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:56.458
But it was yellow like this one.

1:23:57.500 --> 1:23:59.125
There are many yellow cars, like this one.

1:23:59.625 --> 1:24:02.875
Sir, a retired professor lives next door.

1:24:03.125 --> 1:24:04.625
He has the same kind of yellow car.

1:24:04.875 --> 1:24:06.708
Oh, then it could be that car.

1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.125
What? You could say that for sure?

1:24:12.167 --> 1:24:13.542
He thinks he's so intelligent!

1:24:18.333 --> 1:24:19.750
Sir, a fax from the IG office.

1:24:19.917 --> 1:24:22.333
Sir, Sameer Deshmukh went
on a school trip the last month.

1:24:22.750 --> 1:24:25.375
Two students from Vidya Vikas Vidyalaya
were there, too.

1:24:25.708 --> 1:24:27.042
I have their names and addresses.

1:24:27.833 --> 1:24:29.208
One of them is Anju Salgaonkar.

1:24:30.375 --> 1:24:31.875
Vijay Salgaonkar's daughter.

1:24:32.958 --> 1:24:34.083
Adopted.

1:24:35.542 --> 1:24:36.833
-Adopted?
-Yeah.

1:24:38.375 --> 1:24:39.667
I didn't know that.

1:24:40.792 --> 1:24:43.625
Yes, sir. When Vijay was 21 years old,

1:24:44.042 --> 1:24:47.333
he found a baby near a garbage bin
on the road.

1:24:48.417 --> 1:24:50.917
Someone had abandoned that little baby.

1:24:52.083 --> 1:24:53.542
Vijay is an orphan himself.

1:24:54.167 --> 1:24:56.542
That's why he took the child home.

1:24:57.083 --> 1:24:59.125
Later he adopted her legally.

1:25:02.208 --> 1:25:04.875
I always thought
Anju and Vijay were related by blood.

1:25:06.917 --> 1:25:08.000
What is this, Gaitonde?

1:25:08.667 --> 1:25:12.000
Shame on you for accusing
such a decent man.

1:25:15.292 --> 1:25:19.250
Just because he adopted an orphan,
it doesn't mean he can't commit crimes.

1:25:19.750 --> 1:25:23.667
We just found out
Sameer and Anju are connected in some way.

1:25:24.833 --> 1:25:27.333
I think we should arrest Vijay,

1:25:27.417 --> 1:25:29.875
slap him around a bit
and he'll spill the beans.

1:25:30.875 --> 1:25:33.542
Don't let this information leak out
of this station.

1:25:34.417 --> 1:25:36.375
-It's...
-It's 11:30.

1:25:49.375 --> 1:25:52.125
Anju, the principal wants to see you.

1:26:05.292 --> 1:26:08.500
The police have one last piece of evidence
to prove what happened.

1:26:09.125 --> 1:26:10.125
Our fear.

1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:12.292
So, forget what happened.

1:26:13.167 --> 1:26:14.667
Try to behave normally.

1:26:15.417 --> 1:26:18.083
The police don't know
what happened in this house.

1:26:18.417 --> 1:26:21.833
They will question us
on the basis of circumstantial evidence.

1:26:22.458 --> 1:26:25.250
We have to answer them without any fear.

1:26:27.667 --> 1:26:29.208
They will fake things, too.

1:26:29.875 --> 1:26:31.583
But, you knew Sam.

1:26:32.250 --> 1:26:33.917
Don't ever refuse to accept that.

1:26:34.875 --> 1:26:38.000
Just don't tell them anything
that happened in this house.

1:26:40.917 --> 1:26:42.833
Are you Vijay Salgaonkar's daughter?

1:26:43.250 --> 1:26:44.167
Yes, sir.

1:26:45.500 --> 1:26:48.625
-Do you know this boy?
-Oh, that's Sam.

1:26:50.167 --> 1:26:52.500
So, how do you know Sam?

1:26:52.917 --> 1:26:55.958
I represented my school
at a nature camp last month.

1:26:56.583 --> 1:26:58.250
That's when I got to know him.

1:26:58.625 --> 1:27:00.250
Was it just an acquaintance or...

1:27:01.250 --> 1:27:03.083
No, sir. Just an acquaintance.

1:27:03.292 --> 1:27:06.167
Just like all the other students
at the camp.

1:27:06.375 --> 1:27:08.167
There were thousands of students
at the camp,

1:27:08.625 --> 1:27:10.875
how come you remember Sam's face?

1:27:11.333 --> 1:27:14.833
Sam was quite famous at the camp.

1:27:15.583 --> 1:27:18.667
-Why?
-He took pictures of girls at the camp.

1:27:19.042 --> 1:27:20.083
He shot videos, too.

1:27:20.500 --> 1:27:23.708
A lawyer's daughter complained about him.

1:27:24.375 --> 1:27:25.667
Oh, I see.

1:27:26.625 --> 1:27:29.083
Did Sam ever come to meet you
after the camp?

1:27:29.958 --> 1:27:31.917
-No, sir.
-Why are you lying?

1:27:32.125 --> 1:27:34.333
We were told he came to meet you!

1:27:34.917 --> 1:27:37.292
Who told you that? Did Sam tell you?

1:27:38.875 --> 1:27:40.792
Yes, he did.

1:27:41.542 --> 1:27:42.625
Sam told us.

1:27:42.958 --> 1:27:44.708
Sir, Sam is lying.

1:27:44.833 --> 1:27:49.375
Did Sam come to meet you
on the 2nd of October at your place?

1:27:49.583 --> 1:27:50.792
-To my place?
-Yes.

1:27:50.958 --> 1:27:52.000
Not at all.

1:27:52.292 --> 1:27:54.875
Besides, we weren't home
on the 2nd of October.

1:27:55.167 --> 1:27:56.208
Where did you go?

1:27:56.417 --> 1:27:58.958
Swami Chinmayanand was holding
a sermon at Panaji.

1:27:59.167 --> 1:28:01.333
-We all attended it.
-Who all attended it?

1:28:01.708 --> 1:28:04.708
Mom, Dad, my younger sister Anu and me.

1:28:04.875 --> 1:28:07.375
-When did you get back?
-The next day, the 3rd.

1:28:07.542 --> 1:28:09.208
Did the sermon last for two days?

1:28:09.792 --> 1:28:12.417
Yes, but we attended it on the 2nd.

1:28:12.792 --> 1:28:15.125
After that, we stayed in a hotel

1:28:15.250 --> 1:28:17.125
and saw a movie the next day
before returning home.

1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:18.583
I see.

1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:22.000
Ma'am, show us
the attendance register, please.

1:28:22.458 --> 1:28:25.625
Let's see, whether she came
to school on the second.

1:28:26.583 --> 1:28:28.542
There was a holiday at school on the 2nd.

1:28:28.958 --> 1:28:30.125
Gandhi Jayanti.

1:28:30.292 --> 1:28:34.083
Right, and the 3rd was a Sunday.
That's why we planned it.

1:28:34.417 --> 1:28:39.125
So, you mean you've never met Sam
after the camp.

1:28:39.708 --> 1:28:40.708
No, sir.

1:29:03.708 --> 1:29:05.833
Are you Vijay Salgaonkar's wife?

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.083
Yes.

1:29:20.208 --> 1:29:22.875
Vijay! How come you are home at this time?

1:29:24.417 --> 1:29:27.500
Anju's principal called Nandini
and informed her about your visit there.

1:29:28.125 --> 1:29:29.458
She got scared and called me.

1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:31.875
I went to the station
and found out you're here.

1:29:32.458 --> 1:29:33.667
I rushed home.

1:29:34.333 --> 1:29:37.042
-What has happened?
-We need to question you.

1:29:37.625 --> 1:29:38.917
Come in, let's sit down.

1:29:39.917 --> 1:29:41.833
Vijay, do you know this boy?

1:29:42.875 --> 1:29:43.917
No, sir.

1:29:44.208 --> 1:29:47.083
-What about you?
-No, sir.

1:29:49.250 --> 1:29:50.375
Have you seen this car?

1:29:51.792 --> 1:29:52.792
No, sir.

1:29:53.208 --> 1:29:54.333
What about you?

1:29:55.292 --> 1:29:56.292
No, sir.

1:30:00.250 --> 1:30:01.417
Let me be frank, here.

1:30:02.625 --> 1:30:03.792
That's what I'd prefer, too.

1:30:05.333 --> 1:30:08.292
This is IG Meera Deshmukh's only son,
Sam Deshmukh.

1:30:08.958 --> 1:30:10.750
He is missing since the last 25 days.

1:30:12.292 --> 1:30:15.958
Last month, during the nature camp,
he met your daughter, Anju.

1:30:16.667 --> 1:30:20.500
We also have proof, he came here
in a yellow Hyundai Getz.

1:30:21.417 --> 1:30:24.708
This car was recovered in the last month
from Paavelim Stone Quarry.

1:30:26.500 --> 1:30:27.917
We came here for two reasons.

1:30:28.625 --> 1:30:30.208
First, Anju knew Sam.

1:30:30.708 --> 1:30:34.875
Secondly, Gaitonde saw you
driving Sam's car.

1:30:35.958 --> 1:30:38.875
When you took the car
near Subhash Salvi's house...

1:30:39.750 --> 1:30:40.833
I was there.

1:30:43.042 --> 1:30:44.750
We think Sam came to your place.

1:30:45.333 --> 1:30:47.083
But we weren't here on the 2nd.

1:30:47.583 --> 1:30:50.250
We went to Panaji for a sermon
and got back on the third.

1:30:53.708 --> 1:30:55.750
Vijay Salgaonkar, your game is up.

1:30:57.750 --> 1:30:59.000
Sir, what more proof do you need?

1:31:00.667 --> 1:31:02.542
Don't you laugh at me.

1:31:03.458 --> 1:31:06.750
I didn't even mention
which date Sam came to your place.

1:31:07.208 --> 1:31:08.500
But your wife...

1:31:09.333 --> 1:31:10.708
blurted, without being asked.

1:31:11.792 --> 1:31:14.000
-Vijay, are you laughing at us?
-No, sir.

1:31:15.542 --> 1:31:16.833
Why should I laugh at the police?

1:31:17.917 --> 1:31:20.292
Look at her, she is still shocked.

1:31:21.167 --> 1:31:23.083
She doesn't know what is going on.

1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:25.792
You've really petrified her.

1:31:27.292 --> 1:31:30.875
I told you, earlier,
the principal called Nandini.

1:31:31.167 --> 1:31:33.917
She said you went to the school
about a case.

1:31:34.583 --> 1:31:36.292
You questioned Anju, too.

1:31:36.750 --> 1:31:40.292
The school authorities panic
in such situations.

1:31:40.833 --> 1:31:44.417
They think the case will ruin
the school's image.

1:31:45.375 --> 1:31:47.792
So, the principal called Nandini
and told her all about it.

1:31:48.417 --> 1:31:51.167
Even the dates. Simple.

1:31:52.250 --> 1:31:57.125
Gaitonde saw you driving Sam's car
on Sunday, the 3rd.

1:31:58.292 --> 1:31:59.708
You didn't answer him.

1:32:02.292 --> 1:32:04.375
-There's no use.
-Why?

1:32:05.292 --> 1:32:08.708
Because everyone knows
we can't stand each other.

1:32:10.125 --> 1:32:12.625
No matter what I say
he will brand me a liar.

1:32:13.375 --> 1:32:14.750
Forget about Gaitonde.

1:32:15.208 --> 1:32:16.333
Tell me the truth.

1:32:17.167 --> 1:32:18.875
If Gaitonde saw me,

1:32:19.542 --> 1:32:22.750
either he's lying or he is mistaken.

1:32:23.583 --> 1:32:25.917
Because on 2nd October from 8:00...

1:32:26.625 --> 1:32:28.917
to 3rd October till 17:00.

1:32:29.292 --> 1:32:30.875
My family and I were in Panaji.

1:32:31.333 --> 1:32:32.667
Sir, he's lying.

1:32:33.417 --> 1:32:34.875
I saw him that day!

1:32:36.583 --> 1:32:38.875
What did you do from 2nd to the 3rd?

1:32:39.625 --> 1:32:41.833
Where did you go?

1:32:43.250 --> 1:32:45.542
-Can you give me the details?
-Of course.

1:32:46.542 --> 1:32:49.625
On 2nd October, we took the 5:30 bus
and headed to Panaji.

1:33:12.958 --> 1:33:16.250
-When you got back, was it raining?
-Yes, it was.

1:33:17.042 --> 1:33:18.500
Nandini and the kids got drenched.

1:33:19.042 --> 1:33:20.458
So, they fell sick.

1:33:21.250 --> 1:33:23.750
-They missed school for a couple of days.
-Okay.

1:33:24.750 --> 1:33:28.042
So, you kept the bills and tickets
just to show us, right?

1:33:29.375 --> 1:33:32.083
Sir, whoever keeps bus tickets?

1:33:33.958 --> 1:33:36.625
Sir, we are middle class people.

1:33:37.833 --> 1:33:39.667
We try to save as much as we can.

1:33:40.958 --> 1:33:43.375
We check the bills
on the last day of the month.

1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:47.167
To find out the unnecessary expenses
and the savings.

1:33:59.292 --> 1:34:03.625
I messed up by talking about the dates?

1:34:07.750 --> 1:34:12.083
But you explained everything
and sent them away.

1:34:13.875 --> 1:34:15.250
They won't come back, right?

1:34:18.083 --> 1:34:19.875
Gaitonde, your allegations are nonsense.

1:34:20.833 --> 1:34:23.708
I think Vijay and his family went
to Panaji.

1:34:24.125 --> 1:34:26.625
Sir, I swear to you! It was Vijay.

1:34:27.167 --> 1:34:29.042
Sir, let's remand him to custody.

1:34:29.125 --> 1:34:32.083
He won't be so sharp
once he's beaten up a bit.

1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.125
Anyway, inform the IG.

1:34:36.417 --> 1:34:40.667
Sir, let's get hold of Vijay first.
What if we inform the IG later?

1:34:51.167 --> 1:34:54.167
Did the police believe us?

1:34:56.792 --> 1:34:58.208
I don't know, dear.

1:34:59.750 --> 1:35:01.417
Will they come back?

1:35:03.792 --> 1:35:05.708
Yes, they will be back.

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.333
-What is his name?
-Vijay Salgaonkar.

1:35:19.208 --> 1:35:21.542
Are you sure he was driving Sam's car?

1:35:22.250 --> 1:35:23.917
Ma'am, I don't remember
the license number.

1:35:24.333 --> 1:35:26.542
But it was a yellow Hyundai Getz car.

1:35:26.875 --> 1:35:29.917
But are you sure
Vijay Salgaonkar was driving it?

1:35:30.250 --> 1:35:32.083
Yes, sir. Absolutely sure.

1:35:32.292 --> 1:35:34.625
But they said they were
at Panaji on the 2nd and 3rd.

1:35:35.583 --> 1:35:37.667
-Sir, they're lying.
-They're lying?

1:35:38.958 --> 1:35:41.208
But what about all the proof of his trip?

1:35:41.667 --> 1:35:43.708
He showed us hotel bills and bus tickets.

1:35:44.208 --> 1:35:47.875
But we'll know if they are real or fake
only after we check them, sir.

1:35:50.500 --> 1:35:55.833
If Gaitonde is right,
those bills must be forged.

1:35:56.750 --> 1:35:59.458
That won't be too difficult to find out.

1:36:01.125 --> 1:36:05.292
After all, he is an illiterate,
fourth grade dropout.

1:36:05.375 --> 1:36:06.583
He can't be too smart.

1:36:07.500 --> 1:36:14.333
Tomorrow bring Vijay, his family
and all the evidence shown by him to me.

1:36:14.708 --> 1:36:16.625
But, on what charge can we bring them in?

1:36:17.208 --> 1:36:19.708
Kidnapping, not murder.

1:36:20.292 --> 1:36:22.125
Because we need a corpse to prove that.

1:36:23.542 --> 1:36:24.875
You don't worry about protocol.

1:36:31.375 --> 1:36:33.583
Uncle!

1:36:34.292 --> 1:36:36.625
Mr. Rane! You're here, early!

1:36:36.875 --> 1:36:39.292
The police took Vijay and his family in.

1:36:49.417 --> 1:36:51.167
When did you leave for Panaji?

1:36:51.542 --> 1:36:54.208
We took a private bus to Panaji at 5:30.

1:36:54.500 --> 1:36:55.958
So where is that bus ticket?

1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:00.583
His friend owns the bus,
so the conductor didn't let us pay.

1:37:01.167 --> 1:37:03.292
When did you reach
the venue of the sermon?

1:37:04.625 --> 1:37:08.000
At 8:30. The sermon had already begun.

1:37:08.625 --> 1:37:12.375
I guess about 8:30.

1:37:12.583 --> 1:37:15.333
When we arrived, the sermon had begun.

1:37:15.625 --> 1:37:17.708
When did you reach
the venue of the sermon?

1:37:22.292 --> 1:37:25.958
If our statements are exactly alike,
they may have doubts.

1:37:26.292 --> 1:37:27.542
Especially when it comes to timings.

1:37:28.250 --> 1:37:29.917
Mom and I will give the exact time.

1:37:30.708 --> 1:37:32.083
You can skirt around it.

1:37:32.583 --> 1:37:37.583
I don't remember the exact time,
but when we arrived the sermon had begun.

1:37:38.042 --> 1:37:42.000
What time did the sermon begin
after you got there?

1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:46.833
The police are going to try to ask
complicated questions.

1:37:47.750 --> 1:37:50.833
Listen to them carefully and then answer.

1:37:51.917 --> 1:37:54.833
The sermon began before we reached there.

1:37:55.750 --> 1:37:58.667
But your mom and dad said

1:37:58.750 --> 1:38:02.000
that the sermon began
after you reached the venue.

1:38:02.167 --> 1:38:03.500
After half an hour.

1:38:04.208 --> 1:38:07.042
They will lie about us
telling them something different.

1:38:07.500 --> 1:38:10.292
But stick to your story at all times.

1:38:11.458 --> 1:38:14.500
No! When we arrived,
the event had already begun.

1:38:18.250 --> 1:38:19.833
-Martin!
-This way.

1:38:20.125 --> 1:38:21.250
What's the matter? Where are they?

1:38:21.333 --> 1:38:22.625
-They were taken in.
-They were?

1:38:22.708 --> 1:38:24.125
These people aren't telling me anything!

1:38:24.208 --> 1:38:25.875
-We want to go in.
-You're not allowed in.

1:38:26.208 --> 1:38:27.625
-He's Vijay's father-in-law.
-I don't care!

1:38:27.708 --> 1:38:29.750
-He's not allowed in and that's all!
-How can you stop me?

1:38:29.917 --> 1:38:31.958
You have taken my daughter
into police custody, too!

1:38:32.042 --> 1:38:33.500
-Come on, open the gate--
-No!

1:38:33.583 --> 1:38:34.875
-No, get back.
-Open the gate.

1:38:34.958 --> 1:38:37.542
-Get back!
-Open the gate!

1:38:37.625 --> 1:38:39.958
Later we went to a restaurant to eat food.

1:38:40.417 --> 1:38:41.833
What was the name of the hotel?

1:38:44.875 --> 1:38:46.583
I don't remember that.

1:38:47.625 --> 1:38:50.250
-What did you eat?
-Pav Bhaji.

1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.792
-What did the others eat?
-Everyone ate Pav Bhaji.

1:38:54.208 --> 1:38:58.250
But Anju said she ate fried rice.

1:39:05.042 --> 1:39:10.208
No! She must have forgotten.
I remember we all ate Pav Bhaji.

1:39:13.167 --> 1:39:16.042
Hello? Yes, it's me. Tell me.

1:39:17.167 --> 1:39:18.583
No, that's a lie.

1:39:19.792 --> 1:39:21.042
Who told you that?

1:39:28.917 --> 1:39:30.250
A reporter from India TV called.

1:39:31.458 --> 1:39:33.333
They say they have information...

1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.083
we arrested a family
in connection with Sam's case.

1:39:36.250 --> 1:39:37.750
Forget about it. I don't care, Mahesh.

1:39:38.708 --> 1:39:39.792
What do you think?

1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:43.458
Ma'am, this family is even tougher
than we thought.

1:39:44.083 --> 1:39:45.750
No one changed their statements.

1:39:46.083 --> 1:39:47.708
Specially the younger daughter, Anu.

1:39:48.458 --> 1:39:51.833
I am surprised she stuck to her story
though she is so young!

1:39:53.250 --> 1:39:55.292
That's spot on. Absolutely correct.

1:39:55.542 --> 1:39:58.583
How can a child stick to her statement
so firmly?

1:39:58.750 --> 1:40:00.167
I'm sure something is wrong, ma'am.

1:40:03.958 --> 1:40:05.708
It's possible they are telling the truth.

1:40:06.458 --> 1:40:08.042
So, they are sticking to their statements.

1:40:09.208 --> 1:40:10.875
Perhaps, Gaitonde is mistaken.

1:40:13.083 --> 1:40:16.208
One thing is certain.
They know something about Sam.

1:40:16.542 --> 1:40:18.333
But, Meera, their statements so far--

1:40:18.417 --> 1:40:21.708
Mahesh, they're lying.
It's a cooked-up story.

1:40:22.125 --> 1:40:24.917
Ma'am, if they are lying,
then we can conduct a lie detector test.

1:40:25.042 --> 1:40:26.667
Are you stupid, Gaitonde?

1:40:27.131 --> 1:40:28.881
We can't conduct a lie detector test,
just like that!

1:40:29.006 --> 1:40:32.417
-We need a court order for that.
-So, why can't we get court orders?

1:40:34.125 --> 1:40:37.250
To do that, we have to prove
they are lying in the court.

1:40:37.458 --> 1:40:39.250
So far, all the evidence we have found

1:40:39.333 --> 1:40:42.833
proves the family wasn't there
on that weekend.

1:40:49.292 --> 1:40:50.333
Prabhu.

1:40:51.042 --> 1:40:52.917
They told us a story, right?

1:40:53.625 --> 1:40:55.667
So, bring all the characters
from that story here.

1:40:58.042 --> 1:40:59.125
Besides that...

1:41:00.083 --> 1:41:03.833
if Vijay is lying
about the trip to Panaji,

1:41:04.417 --> 1:41:06.625
then there is someone
who saw him here.

1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:08.167
Of course.

1:41:08.250 --> 1:41:10.542
A boy called Jose works in his office.

1:41:10.708 --> 1:41:12.583
Is there any other place
which he visits regularly?

1:41:13.833 --> 1:41:17.167
There's a hotel named Martin's Corner.
It's right in front of the police station.

1:41:17.292 --> 1:41:18.500
Vijay comes there every day.

1:41:19.667 --> 1:41:23.458
So, bring the office boy
and hotel manager here tomorrow.

1:41:26.917 --> 1:41:28.042
One more thing.

1:41:29.583 --> 1:41:33.958
When the family leaves,
they should feel we believed their story.

1:41:38.042 --> 1:41:43.250
I was really nervous
during the interrogation.

1:41:44.167 --> 1:41:45.917
Luckily, they believed us.

1:41:47.625 --> 1:41:49.333
Who said they believed us?

1:41:50.583 --> 1:41:51.625
What do you mean?

1:41:52.542 --> 1:41:54.875
They won't let us go so easily.

1:41:56.042 --> 1:41:57.250
They will be back.

1:41:58.125 --> 1:41:59.583
They will be even better prepared.

1:42:06.042 --> 1:42:07.083
They will be back.

1:42:07.917 --> 1:42:10.542
Why? Vijay, what's the problem?

1:42:11.875 --> 1:42:13.625
I am your brother-in-law.
At least, tell me.

1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.375
Rajesh, every family has some secrets...

1:42:17.375 --> 1:42:18.875
that are best kept hidden.

1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.292
I am sorry. I can't tell you anything.

1:42:22.833 --> 1:42:25.917
But I will need your help.

1:42:27.250 --> 1:42:28.417
What do you want me to do?

1:42:32.208 --> 1:42:34.417
I have known Vijay since he was a kid.

1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.333
He's really good and decent.

1:42:39.375 --> 1:42:41.750
I don't recall asking
whether he has a heart of gold or silver.

1:42:43.875 --> 1:42:47.917
How many times did he visit
your hotel on the 2nd of October?

1:42:48.292 --> 1:42:49.792
Normally he comes twice a day.

1:42:50.292 --> 1:42:51.750
For evening tea, dinner.

1:42:51.917 --> 1:42:53.333
Sometimes he comes over for lunch, too.

1:42:53.625 --> 1:42:56.250
I guess he came over twice
on the 2nd, too.

1:43:00.667 --> 1:43:01.833
No, wait!

1:43:02.750 --> 1:43:04.625
He wasn't here on the 2nd.

1:43:05.542 --> 1:43:06.958
He went to Panaji for a sermon.

1:43:07.042 --> 1:43:08.417
Then, why didn't you tell us that before?

1:43:09.250 --> 1:43:11.417
Sorry, sir.
I remembered it out of the blue.

1:43:12.250 --> 1:43:15.167
A few days ago,
Vijay and I spoke about that.

1:43:15.833 --> 1:43:17.500
What did he tell you about the sermon?

1:43:18.333 --> 1:43:20.333
He told me it was a very good event.

1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:24.792
He even told us
what Swami Chinmayanand said.

1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:26.542
So, what did he say?

1:43:26.917 --> 1:43:29.208
He narrated one of the Jataka fables.

1:43:29.625 --> 1:43:32.625
It was the story of the king of Benaras...

1:43:33.042 --> 1:43:34.667
defeating his enemy
with love and patience.

1:43:34.792 --> 1:43:36.333
When did Vijay get back from Panaji?

1:43:37.417 --> 1:43:39.167
-The next day.
-At what time?

1:43:40.125 --> 1:43:43.875
I don't know that.
He didn't come to the office that day.

1:43:44.083 --> 1:43:45.625
Did Vijay call you from Panaji?

1:43:47.083 --> 1:43:48.250
No.

1:43:48.542 --> 1:43:51.625
-Is Vijay Salgaonkar your friend?
-Yes, he is.

1:43:52.458 --> 1:43:56.750
-Did he travel on your bus recently?
-Yes.

1:43:57.542 --> 1:43:59.250
A few days ago.

1:43:59.833 --> 1:44:02.000
-And before that?
-Before that?

1:44:03.167 --> 1:44:04.583
Right, on the 2nd.

1:44:06.042 --> 1:44:08.542
-Where was he going?
-To Panaji.

1:44:09.542 --> 1:44:11.125
He was going to attend some sermon.

1:44:14.875 --> 1:44:16.875
Are you sure
those people were at your lodge?

1:44:18.458 --> 1:44:20.417
Are they your regular customers?

1:44:21.167 --> 1:44:23.500
-No, sir.
-Then, how can you be sure

1:44:23.583 --> 1:44:25.208
they were at your lodge?

1:44:27.875 --> 1:44:28.917
I need a double room.

1:44:30.250 --> 1:44:31.792
Eight hundred rupees plus taxes.

1:44:32.417 --> 1:44:34.833
What are you saying?
I have stayed here, before.

1:44:35.458 --> 1:44:36.792
You didn't charge taxes back then.

1:44:37.458 --> 1:44:39.500
-Then you won't get any bills.
-That will do.

1:44:44.208 --> 1:44:47.083
Listen, this lodge doesn't seem
to be good enough.

1:44:47.542 --> 1:44:49.208
Let's go to a family hotel.

1:44:49.292 --> 1:44:51.458
Come on, ma'am.
This is a family hotel.

1:44:51.708 --> 1:44:54.083
Don't worry. He's been here before.

1:44:54.583 --> 1:44:57.167
They checked the room first
and only then did they book it.

1:44:57.542 --> 1:44:58.583
When did that happen?

1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:01.167
I don't remember, sir.

1:45:01.542 --> 1:45:03.875
Did they tell you why they were in Panaji?

1:45:05.708 --> 1:45:06.833
No, I don't remember, sir.

1:45:07.708 --> 1:45:08.708
Did you check their register?

1:45:10.042 --> 1:45:13.667
He has two registers.
One of them has Vijay Salgaonkar's name.

1:45:14.208 --> 1:45:18.500
There's a check in on 2nd October,
and check out at 9:30 on the 3rd.

1:45:18.833 --> 1:45:20.125
Why do you have two registers?

1:45:22.208 --> 1:45:24.333
Why don't you answer ma'am?

1:45:25.333 --> 1:45:27.833
One register is for the billing customers.

1:45:28.208 --> 1:45:30.375
The other is for customers
who don't take bills.

1:45:30.875 --> 1:45:32.542
Do you know that's a crime?

1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:38.417
-How can you still remember them?
-Good customers are hard to forget.

1:45:42.792 --> 1:45:43.958
You own the hotel.

1:45:45.208 --> 1:45:46.250
Why? What's the matter?

1:45:46.333 --> 1:45:48.917
No, I have never eaten
such tasty Pav Bhaji.

1:45:49.583 --> 1:45:52.792
My wife makes that at home, but...

1:45:53.958 --> 1:45:56.250
We are famous for Pav Bhaji
in the city of Panaji.

1:45:56.583 --> 1:46:00.333
The hotel is really clean and hygienic.
The service is excellent.

1:46:00.917 --> 1:46:02.875
Once a hotel is famous these days...

1:46:03.292 --> 1:46:05.333
the service tends to get tacky.

1:46:05.792 --> 1:46:07.708
But you're not like that.
I really like that.

1:46:12.208 --> 1:46:16.292
-Uncle, the Pav Bhaji was really good.
-Really?

1:46:17.958 --> 1:46:19.125
What's your name, dear?

1:46:24.708 --> 1:46:27.458
I admit you'd remember customers
who appreciate you.

1:46:27.542 --> 1:46:31.750
But how do you remember which day
and why they came to Panaji?

1:46:32.250 --> 1:46:33.375
They told me.

1:46:34.625 --> 1:46:38.000
-As a businessman...
-Okay, fine!

1:46:38.667 --> 1:46:40.000
You can wait outside.

1:46:43.625 --> 1:46:48.417
If Vijay Salgaonkar met all these people
on 2nd and 3rd October,

1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:51.458
how can he be in Pondolem
at the same time?

1:46:52.333 --> 1:46:53.500
Ma'am, I don't know.

1:46:53.875 --> 1:46:55.583
Now I am a bit confused, too.

1:46:56.125 --> 1:46:57.125
Can I say something?

1:46:58.667 --> 1:47:02.208
If you ask me, I believe
Vijay and his family tell the truth.

1:47:03.958 --> 1:47:05.208
Perhaps your man is lying.

1:47:05.625 --> 1:47:07.792
No, sir. I'm telling the truth.

1:47:08.125 --> 1:47:09.708
It was Vijay Salgaonkar!

1:47:10.083 --> 1:47:13.375
I will resign if I am proved wrong.

1:47:17.292 --> 1:47:18.917
Did you speak to Swami Chinmayanand?

1:47:19.875 --> 1:47:21.083
He was out of town.

1:47:21.375 --> 1:47:23.250
-He may be back by now.
-Call him.

1:47:23.750 --> 1:47:25.667
Given what you've told me,

1:47:25.875 --> 1:47:29.000
it seems Vijay and his family...

1:47:29.458 --> 1:47:31.000
were present at our sermon that day.

1:47:32.500 --> 1:47:34.458
Because every sermon of mine is unique.

1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:36.417
I never repeat it.

1:47:37.417 --> 1:47:41.000
Perhaps someone who attended
it told Vijay later.

1:47:41.333 --> 1:47:45.750
But it's not possible someone remembered
all those details.

1:47:47.542 --> 1:47:48.542
Thank you, Swamiji.

1:47:57.708 --> 1:47:58.875
Where are Dad and Anu?

1:47:59.958 --> 1:48:01.250
This is a digital projector.

1:48:01.500 --> 1:48:03.708
I dream of having my own theater
in Pondolem.

1:48:03.792 --> 1:48:04.875
Very good!

1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.583
All the theaters have
digital projection these days.

1:48:07.875 --> 1:48:10.333
The costs are low
and the quality is pristine.

1:48:12.125 --> 1:48:14.708
-My elder daughter and my wife.
-Hello.

1:48:16.125 --> 1:48:18.625
-Do you remember when they came to you?
-On the 3rd of this month.

1:48:18.875 --> 1:48:20.167
How do you remember the date?

1:48:20.375 --> 1:48:23.833
He saw the first half of the film
from the projection room.

1:48:24.125 --> 1:48:28.667
He also told me he had come
to Panaji for a sermon.

1:48:29.083 --> 1:48:33.208
-And, he was staying in a lodge.
-Get out. Just get out!

1:48:34.542 --> 1:48:37.583
Let's go out, go on.

1:48:37.750 --> 1:48:40.500
Meera, come on.

1:48:58.500 --> 1:49:01.167
Nothing will happen to Sam, okay?
Just stop worrying.

1:49:02.250 --> 1:49:03.292
We'll find him.

1:49:06.625 --> 1:49:08.708
Don't worry and don't lose hope.

1:49:10.958 --> 1:49:12.667
I haven't given up, Mahesh.

1:49:14.375 --> 1:49:15.917
But I am a mom, too.

1:49:16.958 --> 1:49:18.000
I can't help that.

1:49:19.333 --> 1:49:20.458
Stop crying.

1:49:24.833 --> 1:49:25.917
Listen this.

1:49:26.750 --> 1:49:28.708
Is this investigation taking
the right course?

1:49:33.833 --> 1:49:35.583
Then, why can't we unearth any clues?

1:49:36.625 --> 1:49:39.125
All the clues and witnesses seem
to be in his favor.

1:49:43.750 --> 1:49:48.083
All the proof and witnesses are
in Vijay's favor.

1:49:50.125 --> 1:49:51.708
But I know he's lying.

1:49:52.208 --> 1:49:53.542
They are all lying.

1:50:04.125 --> 1:50:07.583
The police can tell
from the way a person talks...

1:50:08.375 --> 1:50:10.458
whether he's lying or telling the truth.

1:50:14.625 --> 1:50:18.292
I underestimated him
by considering him uneducated.

1:50:19.375 --> 1:50:20.667
That was a mistake.

1:50:21.917 --> 1:50:26.208
He may be a 4th grade dropout,
but he is extremely cunning.

1:50:26.625 --> 1:50:27.750
He is really wily.

1:50:28.917 --> 1:50:31.333
Vijay Salgaonkar is a very good man.

1:50:32.208 --> 1:50:33.625
I have checked his records.

1:50:34.917 --> 1:50:36.750
He came to this village 25 years ago.

1:50:37.958 --> 1:50:42.667
First, a tea stall, then a grocery shop,
a video library, a garage...

1:50:42.958 --> 1:50:46.000
He worked in diverse places and grew up.

1:50:46.250 --> 1:50:47.667
Later he started up his own business.

1:50:48.333 --> 1:50:49.500
He's a fourth-grade dropout.

1:50:49.708 --> 1:50:52.167
But he knows Marathi, Hindi,
English and Konkani.

1:50:52.417 --> 1:50:54.250
He says he learnt all that
from watching films.

1:50:55.333 --> 1:50:57.042
He does love movies.

1:50:57.667 --> 1:50:59.208
He never misses out a single film.

1:51:14.208 --> 1:51:16.542
-Come on, let's go!
-Wait a bit.

1:51:16.875 --> 1:51:19.542
-What is it?
-I forget to get money for the tickets.

1:51:19.625 --> 1:51:21.458
Is there any ATM nearby?

1:51:21.542 --> 1:51:24.708
What is this?
I'll have to hold up the bus for you.

1:51:24.917 --> 1:51:26.556
There's an ATM up ahead,
go ahead and hurry back.

1:51:26.656 --> 1:51:27.875
Two minutes. Go on.

1:51:35.292 --> 1:51:37.958
Prabhu, get me all the CCTV footage
from that ATM.

1:51:38.583 --> 1:51:39.958
Where is it? In Panaji?

1:51:40.167 --> 1:51:42.375
Taligaon bus stand,
five km away from Panaji.

1:51:42.708 --> 1:51:44.542
When was the bus scheduled to leave?

1:51:44.875 --> 1:51:45.958
At 15:00 in the afternoon.

1:51:46.667 --> 1:51:50.375
I want the CCTV footage for the ATM
for 3rd October,

1:51:50.458 --> 1:51:52.500
from 14:30 to 15:30 right now.

1:51:53.458 --> 1:51:54.583
Sawant!

1:51:55.500 --> 1:51:57.292
You meet thousands of passengers
every day.

1:51:57.375 --> 1:51:58.458
Yes.

1:51:58.542 --> 1:52:02.000
Let's say, you remember
the family due to the ATM.

1:52:02.625 --> 1:52:04.833
But when did the family go to Panaji?

1:52:04.917 --> 1:52:06.458
Why were they there?

1:52:06.667 --> 1:52:11.708
-It's impossible to remember all of that.
-He told you something 25 days ago.

1:52:11.875 --> 1:52:13.417
How do you still remember it?

1:52:13.667 --> 1:52:15.833
I don't remember. He told me.

1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.583
Yes, but you were told 25 days ago.

1:52:18.667 --> 1:52:20.125
-How can you still--
-No, I...

1:52:20.833 --> 1:52:22.458
-What do you mean?
-I mean...

1:52:22.833 --> 1:52:26.500
he told me that,
when we met again recently.

1:52:28.250 --> 1:52:29.500
-Again?
-Yes.

1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:31.042
When?

1:52:32.542 --> 1:52:33.750
A few days ago.

1:52:34.667 --> 1:52:35.833
Where?

1:52:37.125 --> 1:52:38.250
Where did you meet him?

1:52:42.125 --> 1:52:45.625
-Uncle!
-Oh, how are you?

1:52:46.542 --> 1:52:49.667
-How come you're here?
-Vijay, don't you remember him?

1:52:49.917 --> 1:52:53.583
We came here for Chinmayanand's sermon
on 2nd October.

1:52:53.708 --> 1:52:58.458
When we were going back the next day,
he was the conductor on our bus.

1:52:59.083 --> 1:53:01.542
You went to withdraw cash at the ATM.

1:53:01.875 --> 1:53:06.042
Oh, right! On the 2nd, after the sermon
we went back on the bus on the 3rd.

1:53:06.417 --> 1:53:07.958
-You were the conductor on that bus.
-Right.

1:53:08.250 --> 1:53:09.458
You forget everything!

1:53:09.708 --> 1:53:11.208
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

1:53:11.500 --> 1:53:12.750
-See you later.
-Okay.

1:53:21.542 --> 1:53:24.667
-Mr. Vasu, has the show begun?
-It's you!

1:53:25.083 --> 1:53:27.333
No, there's still time.
Where is your family?

1:53:27.417 --> 1:53:29.250
-No, I am alone today.
-Okay.

1:53:29.333 --> 1:53:31.958
There was a sermon on the 2nd, right?
That's why the family was with me.

1:53:32.375 --> 1:53:34.750
We went shopping on the 3rd
and then came for a movie.

1:53:35.042 --> 1:53:37.083
After that, we ate at the hotel
and then went back home.

1:53:37.417 --> 1:53:39.083
Imagine how expensive that can be.

1:53:44.208 --> 1:53:45.292
Dinkar.

1:53:45.500 --> 1:53:48.583
We went to the sermon at Panaji
on the 2nd on your bus.

1:53:49.208 --> 1:53:50.542
You didn't accept any money from me.

1:53:50.792 --> 1:53:52.167
But that won't happen today.

1:53:53.542 --> 1:53:56.833
-Let me buy the tickets today.
-Don't do that!

1:53:58.083 --> 1:53:59.792
Why don't you tell him?

1:53:59.917 --> 1:54:02.167
She won't say anything to me!
Here, give me tickets.

1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:08.292
You've come after a while, sir.

1:54:08.583 --> 1:54:11.458
No, we were here on the 2nd
for the sermon at Panaji.

1:54:11.792 --> 1:54:16.208
We visited exactly a day after the sermon.

1:54:16.458 --> 1:54:18.708
-On 3rd October.
-Right.

1:54:25.042 --> 1:54:26.000
Three weeks?

1:54:26.083 --> 1:54:28.125
I told you
I'm going to Panaji for the sermon.

1:54:28.208 --> 1:54:31.000
I told you to pay this
the day after I got back.

1:54:32.042 --> 1:54:33.875
-Yes.
-When did I go to Panaji?

1:54:34.458 --> 1:54:35.792
Well...

1:54:36.625 --> 1:54:38.375
On Saturday, the 2nd of October.

1:54:38.917 --> 1:54:40.542
-Yes.
-When did I go?

1:54:41.625 --> 1:54:42.958
On Saturday, the 2nd of October.

1:54:43.125 --> 1:54:46.500
When did I get back?
On Sunday the 3rd of October!

1:54:47.375 --> 1:54:50.000
Yes, you got back on Sunday,
3rd October.

1:54:50.542 --> 1:54:54.542
The next day on 4th October, a Monday,
I told you to pay this.

1:54:55.625 --> 1:54:56.958
-Yes.
-Go and pay it!

1:55:00.083 --> 1:55:02.667
The other king was reformed
by his example.

1:55:04.375 --> 1:55:06.750
The moral of this story is
we must cultivate...

1:55:07.708 --> 1:55:10.250
the power to forgive others.

1:55:16.375 --> 1:55:18.375
But how did you hear that story?

1:55:19.125 --> 1:55:20.750
I told you we went to Panaji...

1:55:21.333 --> 1:55:23.083
to attend Swami Chinmayanand's sermon.

1:55:23.458 --> 1:55:26.000
-When?
-Did you forget it yet?

1:55:26.792 --> 1:55:28.792
We went on the 2nd,
it was a Saturday.

1:55:29.167 --> 1:55:30.500
And we got back on the 3rd.

1:55:32.792 --> 1:55:33.917
That's where I heard this story.

1:55:38.667 --> 1:55:41.208
Ma'am, Swami Chinmayanand.

1:55:44.042 --> 1:55:48.500
-Yes, Swamiji.
-My followers record my sermons.

1:55:49.375 --> 1:55:52.333
They are provided to the devotees
via DVDs.

1:55:53.375 --> 1:55:55.125
The devotees can make bookings.

1:55:55.917 --> 1:55:59.000
They can pick them up from the ashram
within two weeks.

1:55:59.750 --> 1:56:02.292
I have seen the booking list
for the sermon on the 2nd.

1:56:02.958 --> 1:56:05.083
But Vijay's name doesn't feature in it.

1:56:06.250 --> 1:56:07.375
All right, thank you so much.

1:56:09.458 --> 1:56:11.833
Possibly he booked it under another name.

1:56:12.792 --> 1:56:13.917
It's possible.

1:56:14.792 --> 1:56:18.250
But it doesn't prove he wasn't
in Panaji on the 2nd and 3rd.

1:56:18.708 --> 1:56:22.083
Ma'am, the CCTV footage
for the ICICI Bank.

1:57:05.833 --> 1:57:08.708
Vijay was telling the truth.
We have wasted so much time!

1:57:11.542 --> 1:57:14.125
It may have been better
to try to find Sam instead.

1:57:14.667 --> 1:57:16.875
-But I really...
-Gaitonde.

1:57:17.625 --> 1:57:18.875
But what more proof do you want now?

1:57:29.375 --> 1:57:32.708
Meera, our investigation hinges
on the fact,

1:57:32.792 --> 1:57:35.833
whether Vijay was in Panaji
on the 2nd and 3rd, or not?

1:57:40.292 --> 1:57:43.625
The CCTV proves
Vijay was in Panaji on the 3rd.

1:57:51.375 --> 1:57:55.292
Vijay was in Panaji on the 3rd.

1:58:00.208 --> 1:58:03.750
Vijay was in Panaji on the 3rd, too!

1:58:15.417 --> 1:58:20.458
Mahesh, he knew we were going
to watch this CCTV footage.

1:58:20.542 --> 1:58:22.750
In fact, he wanted us to see it.

1:58:23.667 --> 1:58:25.500
That was part of his plan, Mahesh.

1:58:29.042 --> 1:58:30.875
It was an amazing plan.

1:58:43.708 --> 1:58:46.333
-At about 8:30.
-The sermon had started by then.

1:58:46.625 --> 1:58:48.417
Vijay wasn't here on the 2nd.

1:58:48.500 --> 1:58:51.500
He saw the entire first half of the film
in the projection room.

1:58:51.583 --> 1:58:53.375
No one forgets about good customers.

1:58:53.458 --> 1:58:56.458
He told me about that recently again
when we met.

1:58:56.542 --> 1:58:59.667
We had come to Panaji
for a sermon on the 2nd.

1:59:08.292 --> 1:59:10.042
The 2nd and 3rd of October.

1:59:10.542 --> 1:59:13.708
-What do you mean?
-What do we usually remember?

1:59:15.667 --> 1:59:17.750
Something we have seen for ourselves.

1:59:21.458 --> 1:59:22.458
Visuals.

1:59:23.708 --> 1:59:27.083
Something we see
can't be easily forgotten.

1:59:34.333 --> 1:59:35.500
For example, cinema.

1:59:35.917 --> 1:59:40.375
The stories you are watching are not real.

1:59:41.417 --> 1:59:43.375
But you still believe in them.

1:59:44.875 --> 1:59:48.458
Because you have seen the story
and lived it in a way.

1:59:48.833 --> 1:59:50.042
In the same way,

1:59:50.875 --> 1:59:55.125
Vijay and his family not only concocted
the story about Panaji...

1:59:55.958 --> 1:59:57.125
in fact, they lived it out.

1:59:59.958 --> 2:00:01.417
They actually went to Panaji.

2:00:02.250 --> 2:00:03.500
They stayed at a lodge.

2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:05.583
They did eat the Pav Bhaji.

2:00:05.875 --> 2:00:08.042
He sat in the projection room
and watched the film.

2:00:08.667 --> 2:00:12.333
So, they stuck to their statements,
during the interrogation.

2:00:12.500 --> 2:00:14.250
Because they were telling the truth.

2:00:14.708 --> 2:00:16.083
Apart from one little detail.

2:00:17.542 --> 2:00:18.583
What was that?

2:00:19.208 --> 2:00:22.542
They didn't do all that
on the 2nd and 3rd of October.

2:00:23.167 --> 2:00:24.458
They did that some other day.

2:00:24.958 --> 2:00:26.042
Perhaps the next day.

2:00:27.708 --> 2:00:30.875
Vijay said it was raining on the way back
they were drenched.

2:00:30.958 --> 2:00:32.667
And his family fell sick.

2:00:32.833 --> 2:00:35.833
He also said his kids missed school
for a few days.

2:00:36.208 --> 2:00:37.875
He showed us the medical bills, too.

2:00:38.667 --> 2:00:41.625
You can get fake medical bills
very easily, Sawant.

2:00:42.125 --> 2:00:45.917
Anyway, he's been throwing bills at us
from the word go.

2:00:47.333 --> 2:00:49.875
But there is an entry
in the lodge register for the 2nd.

2:00:50.583 --> 2:00:53.208
The bus and film tickets
for the 3rd are authentic, right?

2:00:57.125 --> 2:01:01.167
Very well played, fourth grade dropout,
Vijay Salgaonkar.

2:01:03.625 --> 2:01:05.750
But I know how you did that.

2:01:07.417 --> 2:01:10.167
Vijay went to Panaji on 3rd October
in Sam's car.

2:01:10.667 --> 2:01:12.792
He took a take away from a restaurant.

2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:16.167
Then he probably bought a used phone.

2:01:16.583 --> 2:01:18.458
He put Sam's SIM card into it.

2:01:18.708 --> 2:01:22.042
Then he dumped the phone
into a truck with a national permit.

2:01:22.667 --> 2:01:26.833
Then he probably dumped Sam's car
into the lake at the quarry.

2:01:27.458 --> 2:01:31.708
Then he went back to a restaurant
and bought four Pav Bhaji takeouts.

2:01:31.875 --> 2:01:34.375
He purchased four tickets
to the cinema on that day.

2:01:34.833 --> 2:01:36.583
Then he went to Taligaon bus stand

2:01:36.708 --> 2:01:39.917
and withdrew the money
from the ATM at 15:00.

2:01:42.042 --> 2:01:44.375
Then he took a Kadamba bus...

2:01:45.125 --> 2:01:47.250
bought four tickets
and got back to Pondolem.

2:01:48.417 --> 2:01:49.875
He went to his office at night.

2:01:49.958 --> 2:01:53.917
He told Jose he was going
for the sermon the next day.

2:01:54.250 --> 2:01:56.125
The next morning he took his family

2:01:56.208 --> 2:01:58.708
and travelled by Dinkar's private bus
to Panaji.

2:01:58.917 --> 2:02:02.667
Vijay told him he was going to Panaji
for the sermon.

2:02:02.917 --> 2:02:07.167
On reaching Panaji,
he may have reached the hermitage at 9:00.

2:02:07.333 --> 2:02:10.500
Then they spent the whole day
at the ashram.

2:02:11.042 --> 2:02:14.667
Meanwhile, he found out
about the DVDs for the sermon.

2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:18.083
He booked it under an assumed name.

2:02:19.167 --> 2:02:20.706
They arrived at Rishabh Lodge
in the evening.

2:02:21.625 --> 2:02:24.208
Then, I guess,
while the manager gave Nandini the tour,

2:02:24.917 --> 2:02:28.500
Vijay filled his name
in the entries for the 2nd.

2:02:29.167 --> 2:02:32.042
When the manager returned,
he disguised his handwriting

2:02:32.125 --> 2:02:33.792
and took the room
under an assumed name.

2:02:34.042 --> 2:02:35.792
They ate out at night.

2:02:36.167 --> 2:02:39.000
The next day, they ordered food
from the same restaurant

2:02:39.083 --> 2:02:41.500
where he bought the takeaways
on the 3rd.

2:02:41.792 --> 2:02:45.000
After checking out of the lodge,
he took his family to the hotel

2:02:45.208 --> 2:02:47.750
where he had ordered
four Pav Bhaji takeaways.

2:02:48.375 --> 2:02:51.125
Again, they ate pav bhaji there.

2:02:51.833 --> 2:02:54.167
They made friends with the owner
while paying the bill.

2:02:54.458 --> 2:02:56.000
Then they watched a film.

2:02:56.083 --> 2:02:58.750
They got acquainted
with the projectionist.

2:03:01.042 --> 2:03:03.667
Later, while withdrawing money
from the ATM at the bus stand,

2:03:03.750 --> 2:03:05.167
Vijay got off the bus.

2:03:07.917 --> 2:03:09.167
But he didn't enter the ATM.

2:03:13.542 --> 2:03:17.000
They made friends with the conductor
on the Kadamba bus.

2:03:18.333 --> 2:03:19.750
They got back home
and, a few days later,

2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:23.875
Vijay watched the sermon with his family.

2:03:24.083 --> 2:03:27.250
Then he destroyed all the bills
for the fifth.

2:03:27.875 --> 2:03:31.583
He showed us bills for the 3rd.

2:03:32.458 --> 2:03:35.625
A few days later he went back to Panaji
with his family.

2:03:36.333 --> 2:03:38.083
He met everyone, once again.

2:03:38.708 --> 2:03:44.000
Then, he very cleverly,
talked to them and implied...

2:03:44.833 --> 2:03:48.667
he and his family went to Panaji
on the 2nd for a sermon.

2:03:49.208 --> 2:03:51.583
He got back on the evening
of 3rd October.

2:03:52.250 --> 2:03:55.625
So, they all didn't realize
they were giving false testimonies.

2:04:00.833 --> 2:04:03.042
They kept thinking
they were telling the truth.

2:04:15.167 --> 2:04:16.917
So, Vijay Salgaonkar...

2:04:19.333 --> 2:04:21.792
mocked the entire police department.

2:04:23.083 --> 2:04:29.875
And despite knowing about all of that,
we have no proof or evidence against him.

2:04:31.208 --> 2:04:32.583
All we have is a theory.

2:04:37.708 --> 2:04:39.958
Without proof or witnesses...

2:04:41.083 --> 2:04:43.167
a confession is the greatest evidence.

2:04:44.792 --> 2:04:45.792
What do you mean?

2:04:47.667 --> 2:04:49.417
-Where are you taking me?
-Come on!

2:04:49.625 --> 2:04:51.042
-Let him go!
-Come on!

2:04:51.208 --> 2:04:53.292
-Don't shout!
-Come on.

2:04:53.375 --> 2:04:54.833
-Let me go, sir.
-Get in.

2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:57.292
-Take them all away!
-Get in, come on!

2:04:57.375 --> 2:04:58.917
How can they take them away?

2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:00.042
Let us go!

2:05:08.792 --> 2:05:10.333
I will need your help.

2:05:11.917 --> 2:05:14.583
-What do you want me to do?
-If the police take us again...

2:05:16.250 --> 2:05:17.833
just call these people.

2:05:45.375 --> 2:05:46.667
Where is my son?

2:05:48.167 --> 2:05:49.375
I don't know.

2:05:50.583 --> 2:05:52.208
We weren't at home.

2:05:54.250 --> 2:05:56.292
Do you think the police are fools?

2:05:57.208 --> 2:06:01.375
We have figured out your plan, Vijay.
It's no use lying now.

2:06:02.125 --> 2:06:04.167
We know you weren't in Panaji
on the 2nd or 3rd.

2:06:04.667 --> 2:06:06.083
You were there on the 4th and the 5th.

2:06:07.542 --> 2:06:10.083
You didn't attend any sermon.

2:06:21.042 --> 2:06:22.875
Why did my son come to meet you?

2:06:24.417 --> 2:06:25.833
What happened with the two of you?

2:06:27.333 --> 2:06:30.708
I never met Sam after the camp, really.

2:06:31.750 --> 2:06:32.875
Listen to me.

2:06:33.833 --> 2:06:36.417
I've had enough of your stories.
It's over!

2:06:38.167 --> 2:06:40.167
You better tell me the truth.

2:06:41.542 --> 2:06:43.958
Or we have other ways to do this.

2:06:45.625 --> 2:06:48.375
I'm telling the truth,
I don't know anything.

2:07:02.125 --> 2:07:03.875
You know how I feel, don't you?

2:07:04.708 --> 2:07:06.042
After all, you are a mom.

2:07:07.125 --> 2:07:08.333
Tell me the truth.

2:07:10.250 --> 2:07:12.625
My son came to meet your daughter
and vanished.

2:07:13.958 --> 2:07:15.167
What happened with them?

2:07:16.292 --> 2:07:18.667
We have already told the truth.

2:07:24.792 --> 2:07:25.875
Gaitonde!

2:07:36.750 --> 2:07:38.125
Tell me, what's the truth?

2:07:39.167 --> 2:07:41.625
Tell me! Tell me, what is it?

2:07:41.708 --> 2:07:43.708
-Please, don't!
-Get back!

2:07:43.875 --> 2:07:44.875
Speak up!

2:07:47.625 --> 2:07:48.708
Tell me!

2:07:53.875 --> 2:07:56.333
Let's see how much you can take.

2:07:56.458 --> 2:07:59.792
Tell me!

2:08:03.042 --> 2:08:04.917
Tell me! Where is Sam?

2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:06.500
Tell me!

2:08:07.208 --> 2:08:08.625
-Tell me!
-Don't hit him.

2:08:08.708 --> 2:08:09.875
What the heck!

2:08:11.458 --> 2:08:12.542
Tell me!

2:08:14.625 --> 2:08:15.917
You better tell me.

2:08:19.208 --> 2:08:22.250
Please, tell him to stop.

2:08:26.333 --> 2:08:27.417
Speak up!

2:08:28.917 --> 2:08:30.042
Please!

2:08:32.042 --> 2:08:33.042
Gaitonde!

2:08:50.333 --> 2:08:51.500
Wait.

2:08:54.292 --> 2:08:55.583
Wait here. You'll know soon enough.

2:08:55.833 --> 2:08:57.083
Where is my son?

2:09:04.667 --> 2:09:06.375
-Speak up!
-Come on!

2:09:06.625 --> 2:09:08.333
Come on, speak up!

2:09:11.292 --> 2:09:12.542
Tell me!

2:09:12.958 --> 2:09:16.292
Tell me where her son is!
Tell her, where is Sam?

2:09:16.583 --> 2:09:19.000
-Tell her!
-Speak up!

2:09:20.958 --> 2:09:22.125
Tell her!

2:09:24.292 --> 2:09:25.917
He came to meet you, right?

2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:27.833
-Tell us where is Sam?
-Go on!

2:09:28.208 --> 2:09:29.417
-Speak up!
-Mom!

2:09:35.792 --> 2:09:37.208
Tell us, where is Sam?

2:09:38.875 --> 2:09:40.208
Alex is here.

2:09:40.417 --> 2:09:41.625
-Send him in.
-Tell us!

2:09:45.208 --> 2:09:48.292
-Tell us, where is Sam?
-Meera, tell them to stop, please.

2:09:49.292 --> 2:09:51.917
-Alex is here.
-Speak up!

2:09:52.458 --> 2:09:54.625
-Tell us, where is Sam?
-Okay, stop it!

2:10:00.833 --> 2:10:01.958
Come with me.

2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:16.208
-You...
-Gaitonde, stop it!

2:10:19.542 --> 2:10:20.625
Get back.

2:10:26.917 --> 2:10:29.333
Vijay, tell me what you know.

2:10:31.667 --> 2:10:33.333
Do you people enjoy getting bashed up?

2:10:36.667 --> 2:10:39.583
I'm telling the truth.
I don't know anything.

2:10:42.250 --> 2:10:43.583
Do you know this girl?

2:10:45.917 --> 2:10:46.958
No, Aunt.

2:10:50.167 --> 2:10:53.250
Alex, Sam was with you
at the nature camp.

2:10:54.750 --> 2:10:57.250
Sam is missing for 26 days.
You know that.

2:10:58.417 --> 2:11:00.375
I'm sure she is connected
to his disappearance.

2:11:01.208 --> 2:11:03.375
So, please, if you have any information...

2:11:04.208 --> 2:11:05.417
do tell us right now.

2:11:06.292 --> 2:11:07.708
Uncle, I don't know anything.

2:11:07.875 --> 2:11:11.292
You called Sam on the day he vanished.
Correct?

2:11:12.250 --> 2:11:14.583
But you refused to admit to it
the other day.

2:11:15.917 --> 2:11:17.750
Are you going to tell me,
or should I tell them?

2:11:18.417 --> 2:11:23.792
Aunt, I spoke to him,
but he didn't tell me where he was.

2:11:24.042 --> 2:11:25.833
How is she connected to Sam?

2:11:26.583 --> 2:11:28.167
Tell me, or I am going to slap you.

2:11:30.542 --> 2:11:31.667
I'll tell you.

2:11:58.292 --> 2:11:59.375
Stay here.

2:12:10.958 --> 2:12:12.000
Hey, bro! Send this to me.

2:12:12.542 --> 2:12:14.250
Sorry, not yet.

2:12:14.625 --> 2:12:16.833
-Why? Send it!
-Not now.

2:12:17.875 --> 2:12:20.250
First, I should make use of this.

2:12:58.542 --> 2:13:00.333
Ma'am, there is a huge crowd outside.

2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:03.667
The media is asking for you.

2:13:03.833 --> 2:13:06.625
Tell them to get lost!
Don't let them get in!

2:13:06.875 --> 2:13:08.167
Call for reinforcements, if needed.

2:13:17.792 --> 2:13:18.875
Now what?

2:13:22.042 --> 2:13:23.167
What do we do?

2:13:27.042 --> 2:13:28.250
We'll end this.

2:13:34.167 --> 2:13:35.333
Go out everyone.

2:13:38.583 --> 2:13:39.833
Gaitonde, you stay here.

2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.208
I found out about the video clip.

2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:52.167
Where is Sam?

2:13:54.375 --> 2:13:55.917
We don't know, ma'am.

2:13:56.667 --> 2:13:58.042
I'm telling the truth.

2:14:08.958 --> 2:14:10.542
Gaitonde, I want the truth.

2:14:11.625 --> 2:14:12.708
Do whatever it takes.

2:14:18.250 --> 2:14:20.083
You darn, where is Sam?

2:14:20.375 --> 2:14:24.750
Tell me, where is Sam?

2:14:26.833 --> 2:14:28.000
You tell me!

2:14:28.542 --> 2:14:30.375
-Tell me, where is Sam?
-No!

2:14:30.458 --> 2:14:32.250
-Where is Sam?
-Mom!

2:14:32.625 --> 2:14:34.625
Tell me! Don't you know?

2:14:35.250 --> 2:14:36.333
You must know!

2:14:37.083 --> 2:14:39.750
Tell me, what did you do to Sam?

2:14:39.833 --> 2:14:42.375
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

2:14:43.875 --> 2:14:44.917
Tell me!

2:14:47.625 --> 2:14:48.875
Are you obstructing a police officer?

2:14:50.042 --> 2:14:51.333
Are you holding the police back?

2:14:55.833 --> 2:14:56.958
You, get lost!

2:14:59.125 --> 2:15:00.417
Are you holding the police back?

2:15:00.833 --> 2:15:02.375
Are you holding the police back?

2:15:02.625 --> 2:15:03.875
Are you holding the police back?

2:15:05.458 --> 2:15:07.500
Are you going to talk?

2:15:07.917 --> 2:15:09.292
Tell me, where is Sam?

2:15:09.667 --> 2:15:11.125
-I don't know, sir.
-You don't know?

2:15:11.208 --> 2:15:12.375
You don't know?

2:15:12.458 --> 2:15:14.583
Listen, I'm going to kill all of you.

2:15:15.667 --> 2:15:16.792
Tell me.

2:15:16.958 --> 2:15:19.542
-Won't you tell me?
-I don't know!

2:15:19.708 --> 2:15:20.667
You don't know?

2:15:20.750 --> 2:15:21.917
-Tell me.
-No, Mom!

2:15:22.750 --> 2:15:24.500
Meera, stop him. Please.

2:15:25.042 --> 2:15:26.583
Tell me. Where is Sam?

2:15:26.792 --> 2:15:29.125
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

2:16:04.042 --> 2:16:06.958
Look. If I hit them a bit more...

2:16:07.917 --> 2:16:11.042
your mom, dad and sister will die.

2:16:13.458 --> 2:16:15.917
If you don't want to tell the truth.

2:16:17.333 --> 2:16:18.667
-No...
-Tell us.

2:16:21.708 --> 2:16:22.833
Tell me.

2:16:28.750 --> 2:16:32.042
Listen, I'm going to kill them all.
Will that do?

2:16:33.625 --> 2:16:34.750
Tell me, are you okay with that?

2:16:49.958 --> 2:16:50.958
Gaitonde.

2:16:57.458 --> 2:16:59.833
She won't speak before the parents.
Send them away.

2:17:00.708 --> 2:17:01.875
Yes, ma'am.

2:17:07.708 --> 2:17:11.917
If you know anything about Sam, tell us!

2:17:18.750 --> 2:17:20.250
Where is Anu?

2:17:21.458 --> 2:17:22.917
-My daughter is in there.
-Wait.

2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:24.439
-My daughter is in there...
-You can't go in.

2:17:24.564 --> 2:17:25.708
-My daughter is in there!
-Wait.

2:17:28.167 --> 2:17:31.792
-Did he come to your house?
-I don't know, Uncle.

2:17:31.958 --> 2:17:34.458
I want to go to my parents.

2:17:35.042 --> 2:17:38.833
Be honest then,
I will take you to your parents.

2:17:45.417 --> 2:17:48.750
You better be honest,
or I am going to get upset.

2:17:49.333 --> 2:17:51.667
When I get angry...

2:17:53.125 --> 2:17:54.208
you know what I can do.

2:17:56.125 --> 2:17:58.875
Tell me the truth
or I am going to kill you!

2:18:00.667 --> 2:18:03.417
We should tell them the truth.

2:18:04.625 --> 2:18:06.583
Gaitonde is a monster.

2:18:07.083 --> 2:18:10.250
What if something happens to Anu?

2:18:11.042 --> 2:18:12.875
I am really scared now.

2:18:13.125 --> 2:18:15.125
I am going to confess.

2:18:15.250 --> 2:18:17.125
-Then, everything will be fine, right?
-No, Nandini.

2:18:19.167 --> 2:18:20.792
Why did we suffer so much?

2:18:22.333 --> 2:18:23.667
Why did we take the beatings?

2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:26.500
So we could give in?

2:18:29.375 --> 2:18:32.792
I promised you,
none of you will go to prison.

2:18:34.250 --> 2:18:35.750
I will keep my promise.

2:18:47.500 --> 2:18:48.833
Don't worry about Anu.

2:18:51.208 --> 2:18:52.542
She's a brave girl.

2:18:53.208 --> 2:18:56.042
-Tell me, what is the truth?
-Uncle, I don't know!

2:18:56.167 --> 2:18:58.208
I want to go to my mom and dad!

2:18:58.500 --> 2:19:01.250
Meera, this is it.
Just stop him! Enough is enough!

2:19:01.583 --> 2:19:03.000
What we're doing here is illegal!

2:19:03.250 --> 2:19:05.458
What about my son?
Who is going to look for him?

2:19:05.750 --> 2:19:07.792
We have to look for him,
but this is not the way!

2:19:07.875 --> 2:19:08.958
Who does this?

2:19:09.167 --> 2:19:10.625
At least, have mercy on that child.

2:19:11.750 --> 2:19:13.167
What are you doing to her?

2:19:13.375 --> 2:19:16.583
And what's going to happen after all this?
Did anyone tell you anything?

2:19:18.417 --> 2:19:22.083
I tell you after all this,
if we find out this family is innocent,

2:19:22.792 --> 2:19:23.875
we will really regret it.

2:19:25.042 --> 2:19:28.958
I mean, just consider for a moment,
what if Gaitonde is mistaken?

2:19:30.458 --> 2:19:32.000
Tell me the truth!

2:19:32.208 --> 2:19:34.000
-Tell me!
-Gaitonde! No!

2:19:35.500 --> 2:19:36.917
Don't hit me!

2:19:37.417 --> 2:19:38.875
I will tell you.

2:19:55.583 --> 2:19:58.333
-Where are you taking my daughter?
-Your daughter is taking us.

2:19:59.083 --> 2:20:00.708
Where you buried the boy.

2:20:01.958 --> 2:20:05.333
Your game is up, Vijay. All done.

2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:09.708
Your next family trip is going to be
in prison.

2:20:11.083 --> 2:20:14.208
Hey, get them all into the jeep.

2:20:44.625 --> 2:20:47.125
Get back! Come on.

2:20:49.875 --> 2:20:51.792
All right, let's go.

2:20:52.792 --> 2:20:54.375
Come on, get back.

2:20:54.667 --> 2:20:57.458
Get back. Come on, let's go.

2:20:57.667 --> 2:20:58.750
-Wait!
-Come on.

2:20:59.375 --> 2:21:01.125
Let us go in.

2:21:01.333 --> 2:21:02.417
He's our son.

2:21:02.833 --> 2:21:05.125
No one is allowed to meet the accused.

2:21:05.250 --> 2:21:07.417
Accused? What has he done?

2:21:07.500 --> 2:21:11.750
-Wait. You'll find out.
-Ma'am, Gaitonde did this.

2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:14.625
Vijay stood up to him.
Gaitonde wants revenge.

2:21:14.708 --> 2:21:16.250
Uncle, what's going on here?

2:21:16.375 --> 2:21:19.042
We don't know yet.
They won't even tell us anything.

2:21:19.167 --> 2:21:20.708
That's my daughter and son-in-law.

2:21:20.792 --> 2:21:23.542
The police remanded them
without any call, a few days back.

2:21:23.625 --> 2:21:26.667
-They were interrogated.
-Interrogated? About what?

2:21:26.875 --> 2:21:29.750
The IG's son is missing.
It's about him.

2:21:30.250 --> 2:21:32.542
-Who are you?
-This is my son.

2:21:32.958 --> 2:21:35.333
We all know Vijay and his family.

2:21:35.417 --> 2:21:38.500
They are good people.
They are being framed here.

2:21:38.958 --> 2:21:42.333
Gaitonde, the man next to Mr. Prabhu,
has been responsible for this!

2:22:24.083 --> 2:22:25.167
Meera!

2:22:55.083 --> 2:22:56.250
Anu!

2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:04.875
Sorry, Dad. I was scared.

2:23:05.167 --> 2:23:06.875
That's why I told them.

2:23:07.542 --> 2:23:08.833
That's okay, dear.

2:23:11.750 --> 2:23:14.167
-He hit you?
-Yes.

2:23:16.583 --> 2:23:18.292
Don't be scared. I'm with you.

2:24:29.458 --> 2:24:31.583
Meera, please.

2:24:35.292 --> 2:24:38.875
Rajesh, Gaitonde hit us.
He hit our baby Anu!

2:24:39.792 --> 2:24:42.583
We are innocent
and still we were thrashed in the room.

2:24:42.667 --> 2:24:43.708
Gaitonde did it!

2:24:44.458 --> 2:24:45.792
Wait, Gaitonde!

2:24:46.042 --> 2:24:48.875
-What the heck! You...
-He hit my daughter.

2:24:48.958 --> 2:24:51.750
-Don't touch him, okay?
-Who are you? Get lost.

2:24:51.917 --> 2:24:54.542
You hit a little girl! Hit him!

2:24:54.625 --> 2:24:56.250
-He hit a little girl!
-Sawant!

2:24:56.333 --> 2:24:57.583
Hit him!

2:24:57.833 --> 2:24:59.292
-He hit Anu!
-Ma'am. Sir.

2:24:59.375 --> 2:25:00.875
-Hit him!
-Meera, come, let's go.

2:25:01.708 --> 2:25:04.042
Hit him! He hit a little girl!

2:25:04.708 --> 2:25:07.750
-Don't you dare touch the child!
-Hit him!

2:25:08.333 --> 2:25:09.708
He hit a little girl!

2:25:29.875 --> 2:25:33.792
In the case of the missing Sam Deshmukh,
son of the Goa IG,

2:25:34.083 --> 2:25:36.792
the police has brutally tortured
Vijay Salgaonkar and his family

2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:38.792
despite their innocence.

2:25:38.958 --> 2:25:43.417
There is hostility all over against them.

2:25:43.833 --> 2:25:48.667
After this incident, the Pondolem police
SI Gaitonde has been suspended.

2:25:48.750 --> 2:25:50.875
Orders have been sent out
for further investigation.

2:25:50.958 --> 2:25:53.375
Senior PI Prabhu
and the officers on this case

2:25:53.458 --> 2:25:55.708
have all been transferred out at once.

2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:59.792
The DGP has sent IG Meera Deshmukh,
on an indefinite leave.

2:25:59.917 --> 2:26:03.458
In its verdict on a PIL,
the court has decreed

2:26:03.542 --> 2:26:09.250
that if the police want to interrogate
Vijay Salgaonkar or his family,

2:26:09.458 --> 2:26:11.125
they need court orders to do so.

2:26:14.458 --> 2:26:15.625
Vijay!

2:26:24.042 --> 2:26:25.625
Vijay, don't you think...

2:26:26.542 --> 2:26:28.750
their lives are completely ruined?

2:26:29.583 --> 2:26:31.042
Anyway, it wasn't her fault.

2:26:33.458 --> 2:26:35.500
She was an IG and a mother.

2:26:36.708 --> 2:26:39.958
I feel as if we did the crime
and she paid for it.

2:26:43.667 --> 2:26:45.667
It's good of you to feel that way.

2:26:47.333 --> 2:26:48.875
But if it were Anju instead of Sam...

2:26:49.583 --> 2:26:50.833
and vice versa...

2:26:52.500 --> 2:26:55.167
wouldn't IG Meera try to save her son?

2:26:56.500 --> 2:26:57.542
Of course, she would.

2:26:58.792 --> 2:27:00.333
There's nothing wrong or right about this.

2:27:03.542 --> 2:27:05.250
A person can't live without his family.

2:27:06.667 --> 2:27:08.125
He can go to any extent for his family.

2:27:10.083 --> 2:27:13.833
The world may call him
self-serving or selfish.

2:27:16.750 --> 2:27:18.542
I guess, it's best to forget about this.

2:27:20.375 --> 2:27:24.875
Vijay, when did you get
the corpse out of the pit?

2:27:25.458 --> 2:27:28.000
After I got back from disposing Sam's car.

2:27:29.458 --> 2:27:30.708
On Sunday night.

2:27:33.292 --> 2:27:34.417
Where did you bury it?

2:27:55.708 --> 2:27:57.167
I have kept that secret safe in my heart.

2:27:58.417 --> 2:27:59.792
That is best for all of us.

2:28:00.750 --> 2:28:02.750
I will take it with me when I die.

2:28:07.542 --> 2:28:09.042
Did you hope that Anu...

2:28:10.167 --> 2:28:13.625
would bear it all without giving in
till the end?

2:28:15.875 --> 2:28:16.958
No.

2:28:18.750 --> 2:28:22.292
The three of you couldn't keep it together
for so long.

2:28:24.208 --> 2:28:26.042
Anu could have spoken up earlier.

2:28:27.833 --> 2:28:28.833
Poor Anu.

2:28:32.708 --> 2:28:35.000
You've suffered a lot because of me.

2:28:35.292 --> 2:28:37.250
Dad, the police is here.

2:28:47.833 --> 2:28:50.292
Why are you here?
Are you back to harass them?

2:28:50.375 --> 2:28:53.333
-We just want to talk to Vijay.
-Do you have a court order?

2:29:00.292 --> 2:29:02.625
-What's up, Vijay?
-It's okay, you leave.

2:29:03.667 --> 2:29:04.875
I'm going to change and be with you.

2:29:41.042 --> 2:29:42.083
We are not here...

2:29:43.875 --> 2:29:48.625
as the IG, the police or a businessman.

2:29:50.583 --> 2:29:52.250
We are here as parents.

2:29:55.500 --> 2:29:58.042
We had given up hope of being parents.

2:29:59.875 --> 2:30:01.333
But then we suddenly had a son.

2:30:03.167 --> 2:30:04.375
Our only son.

2:30:05.042 --> 2:30:08.083
I guess, that's why
we pampered him so much...

2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:12.292
we are regretting it today.

2:30:20.125 --> 2:30:22.625
Vijay, when we thought
about it we realized...

2:30:24.708 --> 2:30:29.333
whatever our son has experienced
or not...

2:30:31.042 --> 2:30:32.750
is perhaps our own fault.

2:30:33.708 --> 2:30:37.167
We pampered him no end and ruined him.

2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:42.583
That's why we wanted to meet you, too.

2:30:44.792 --> 2:30:46.125
Inadvertently...

2:30:47.333 --> 2:30:49.917
we have harassed you
and your family a lot.

2:30:55.625 --> 2:30:56.875
We are sorry.

2:30:58.167 --> 2:30:59.417
We are really sorry.

2:31:03.333 --> 2:31:05.083
We are leaving the country.

2:31:06.542 --> 2:31:09.417
To London, to live with her brother.

2:31:11.625 --> 2:31:13.417
But, before we leave, Vijay...

2:31:17.583 --> 2:31:21.583
just tell us what happened to Sam?

2:31:28.042 --> 2:31:32.000
Whenever there is a call
we think it's Sam.

2:31:33.417 --> 2:31:36.417
When the doorbell rings,
it feels like he's there.

2:31:40.833 --> 2:31:42.667
We can't bear the suspense.

2:31:44.375 --> 2:31:46.125
We can't live like this.

2:31:47.042 --> 2:31:48.542
Just tell us, should we...

2:31:53.375 --> 2:31:55.250
wait for him?

2:31:57.333 --> 2:31:58.583
Or...

2:32:04.125 --> 2:32:05.375
That's all.

2:32:18.208 --> 2:32:19.417
No, Meera.

2:32:21.083 --> 2:32:22.167
It's not your fault.

2:32:28.417 --> 2:32:29.833
Why would you trust us?

2:32:43.375 --> 2:32:44.500
Meera, let's go!

2:32:45.250 --> 2:32:46.417
We are sorry, too.

2:32:52.167 --> 2:32:55.458
I wish I was as generous as you.

2:32:57.792 --> 2:32:59.875
But I am merely a fourth-grade dropout.

2:33:01.375 --> 2:33:02.708
I have a wife.

2:33:03.417 --> 2:33:04.792
I have two daughters.

2:33:05.250 --> 2:33:06.583
And that's the extent of my world.

2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:08.667
I have never thought beyond that.

2:33:10.458 --> 2:33:11.833
One day, my world...

2:33:12.792 --> 2:33:14.167
saw an unwanted guest enter.

2:33:15.125 --> 2:33:16.667
He wanted to...

2:33:18.125 --> 2:33:19.583
disrupt our world.

2:33:23.333 --> 2:33:25.250
We tried to stop him.

2:33:25.750 --> 2:33:26.958
We begged him.

2:33:29.167 --> 2:33:30.375
But he didn't listen.

2:33:33.083 --> 2:33:34.333
Then, somehow...

2:33:35.667 --> 2:33:36.875
a tragedy occurs.

2:33:41.792 --> 2:33:45.208
We send the unwanted guest...

2:33:46.667 --> 2:33:49.708
to a place
from where there is no coming back.

2:34:09.625 --> 2:34:12.000
We have given you
the greatest anguish in the world.

2:34:15.792 --> 2:34:17.625
I tried to say sorry many times.

2:34:19.417 --> 2:34:20.750
I did so in my heart.

2:34:22.792 --> 2:34:24.458
What else could we do?

2:34:25.958 --> 2:34:28.000
My family is most important to me.

2:34:30.208 --> 2:34:31.625
I could do anything for them.

2:34:32.542 --> 2:34:33.958
I could go to any extent.

2:34:35.542 --> 2:34:39.792
At that moment,
I lose sight of right or wrong.

2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:48.208
We are sorry.

2:35:37.167 --> 2:35:39.375
Listen to me. Sir has called you.

2:35:43.500 --> 2:35:45.375
Sir, I'm going to keep my bags
in the quarters.

2:35:47.625 --> 2:35:49.833
Sir, this is Vijay Salgaonkar.

2:35:51.667 --> 2:35:54.625
I know.
I have seen you on the TV.

2:35:55.542 --> 2:35:57.667
Here you are. Sign that.

2:36:01.083 --> 2:36:04.917
You must be feeling really proud.
You have fooled the police and all that.

2:36:06.292 --> 2:36:07.375
You just wait.

2:36:07.583 --> 2:36:10.417
Once the corpse is found,
then we shall see.

2:36:11.667 --> 2:36:14.583
I'm going to be here
for a couple of years.

2:36:15.750 --> 2:36:17.333
I am going to find it.

2:36:18.667 --> 2:36:20.042
No, sir.

2:36:20.750 --> 2:36:22.708
Who am I to fool the police?

2:36:24.792 --> 2:36:26.458
I respect the police.

2:36:27.750 --> 2:36:30.792
-I think the police protects us.
-Right.

2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:33.333
I believe...

2:36:34.583 --> 2:36:37.083
you and your police station...

2:36:38.083 --> 2:36:39.417
will always protect us.

2:36:41.625 --> 2:36:42.875
I'll leave now.

2:37:31.083 --> 2:37:33.042
The slab has been laid
at the police station.

2:37:33.583 --> 2:37:35.375
The flooring will be laid on Monday.
