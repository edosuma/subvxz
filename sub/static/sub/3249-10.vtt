00:09.160 --> 00:11.439
(FOOTSTEPS)

00:32.960 --> 00:36.919
So this is one of the last paintings
Van Gogh ever painted.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.759
Those final months of his life

00:38.840 --> 00:43.079
were probably the most astonishing
artistic outpouring in history.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.639
It was like Shakespeare
knocking off Othello,

00:46.720 --> 00:49.919
Macbeth and King Lear
over the summer hols.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.759
And especially astonishing
because Van Gogh did it

00:52.840 --> 00:55.599
with no hope of praise or reward.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.999
- Thanks for bringing me.
- You're welcome.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.639
You're being so nice to me.
Why are you being so nice to me?

01:00.720 --> 01:03.519
- I'm always nice to you.
- Not like this.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.879
These places you're taking me -

01:04.960 --> 01:08.959
Arcadia, the Trojan Gardens, now this.
I think it's suspicious.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.159
What? It's not! There's nothing
to be suspicious about.

01:11.240 --> 01:14.799
OK, I was joking. Why aren't you?

01:14.880 --> 01:18.599
CURATOR: Each of these pictures now
is worth tens of millions of pounds.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.839
Yet in his lifetime,
he was a commercial disaster.

01:20.920 --> 01:25.119
Sold only one painting,
and that to the sister of a friend.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.999
We have here possibly
the greatest artist of all time,

01:29.080 --> 01:32.319
but when he died, you could have sold
his entire body of work

01:32.400 --> 01:35.919
and got about enough money
to buy a sofa.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.919
And a couple of chairs.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.679
(LAUGHTER)

01:39.760 --> 01:41.599
If you follow me now...

01:41.680 --> 01:42.919
- CHILDREN: Who is it?
- It's the doctor!

01:43.000 --> 01:47.719
He was the doctor who took care of
Van Gogh when he started to go mad.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.359
- I knew that.
- AMY: Look!

01:49.440 --> 01:51.839
There it is, the actual one.

01:51.920 --> 01:55.439
Yes. You can almost feel his hand
painting it right in front of you.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.439
Carving the colours into shapes...

01:59.520 --> 02:01.479
- Wait a minute.
- What?

02:01.560 --> 02:04.199
Well, just look at that.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.479
- What?
- Something very not good indeed.

02:06.600 --> 02:10.079
- What thing very not good?
- Look there, in the window of the church.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.119
- Is it a face?
- Yes.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.839
And not a nice face at all.

02:18.920 --> 02:22.759
I know evil when I see it
and I see it in that window.

02:22.840 --> 02:26.559
CURATOR: It has changed hands
for something in the region of 20...

02:26.680 --> 02:30.279
DOCTOR: Excuse me. If I can just interrupt
for one second. Sorry, everyone.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.959
Routine inspection,
Ministry of Art and...

02:33.040 --> 02:34.959
- Artiness. So, um...
- Dr Black.

02:35.080 --> 02:38.479
Yes, that's right. Do you know when
that picture of the church was painted?

02:38.560 --> 02:40.799
Ah, well, ah!
What an interesting question.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.239
- Most people...
- I'm going to have to hurry you. When?

02:42.320 --> 02:43.999
- Exactly?
- As exactly as you can.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.159
Without a long speech, if poss.
I'm in a hurry.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.199
Well, in that case,
probably somewhere between

02:49.280 --> 02:50.839
- the 1 st and 3rd ofJune.
- What year?

02:50.920 --> 02:54.719
1 890. Less than a year before...

02:54.800 --> 02:57.199
Before he killed himself.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.519
Thank you, sir. Very helpful indeed.

03:00.600 --> 03:04.519
Nice bow tie. Bow ties are cool.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.559
- Yours is very...
- Oh, thank you.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.199
Keep telling them stuff.
We need to go.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.719
- What about the other pictures?
- Art can wait. This is life and death.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.839
We need to talk to Vincent Van Gogh.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.279
(METALLIC THRUMMING)

03:53.520 --> 03:55.919
(CAT SCREECHES, DOG BARKS)

03:58.320 --> 04:00.799
Right, so here's the plan.
We find Vincent,

04:00.880 --> 04:03.599
and he leads us straight to the church
and our nasty friend.

04:03.680 --> 04:04.759
- Easy-peasy.
- Well, no.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.199
I suspect nothing
will be easy with Mr Van Gogh.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.279
Now, he'll probably be
in the local café -

04:10.360 --> 04:15.159
sort of orangey light,
chairs and tables outside.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.519
- Like this?
- That's the one.

04:18.600 --> 04:22.479
Or indeed like...that.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.399
Yeah, exactly like that.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.199
Good evening.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.639
Does the name Vincent Van Gogh
ring a bell?

04:30.720 --> 04:32.839
Don't mention that man to me.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.879
Excuse me.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.719
- Do you know Vincent Van Gogh?
- Unfortunately.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.439
AMY: Unfortunately?

04:40.520 --> 04:44.639
He's drunk, he's mad
and he never pays his bills.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.279
Good painter, though, eh?

04:47.360 --> 04:49.919
(BOTH LAUGH)

04:50.000 --> 04:52.679
MAN: Come on! Come on!

04:52.760 --> 04:54.519
One painting for one drink.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.279
That's not a bad deal.

04:56.360 --> 04:58.439
It wouldn't be a bad deal
if the painting were any good.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.319
I can't hang that up on my walls.
It'd scare the customers half to death.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.999
It's bad enough having you
in here in person,

05:05.080 --> 05:07.959
let alone looming over the customers
day and night in a stupid hat.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.239
You pay money or you get out.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.319
- I'll pay if you like.
- What?

05:11.400 --> 05:13.799
Well, if you like,
I'll pay for the drink.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.159
Or I'll pay for the painting,

05:15.240 --> 05:17.439
and you can use the money
to pay for the drink.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.799
Exactly who are you?

05:20.880 --> 05:24.199
Oh, I'm...new in town.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.999
Well, in that case,
you don't know three things.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.919
One, I pay for my own drinks,
thank you.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.399
(LAUGHTER)

05:31.480 --> 05:33.679
Two, no-one ever buys
any of my paintings

05:33.760 --> 05:35.679
or they would
be laughed out of town,

05:35.800 --> 05:39.439
so if you want to stay in town,
I suggest you keep your cash to yourself.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.279
And three, your friend's cute,

05:41.360 --> 05:44.239
but you should keep your big nose
out of other people's business.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.279
Come on, just one more drink.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.959
- I'll pay tomorrow.
- No.

05:48.040 --> 05:51.919
Or, on the other hand,
slightly more compassionately, yes?

05:52.000 --> 05:55.439
Or, on the other hand, to protect
my business from madmen, no.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.479
Or...

05:56.560 --> 05:59.999
Oh, look, just shut up,
the pair of you!

06:00.080 --> 06:02.319
I would like a bottle of wine, please,

06:02.400 --> 06:05.839
which I will then share
with whomever I choose.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.799
That could be good.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.919
- That's good by me.
- Good.

06:18.280 --> 06:22.519
That accent of yours.
Are you from Holland, like me?

06:22.600 --> 06:25.199
- Yes.
- No.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.799
She means yes. So, start again.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.079
- Hello, I'm the Doctor.
- I knew it!

06:30.160 --> 06:32.319
Sorry?

06:32.400 --> 06:36.279
My brother's always sending doctors,
but you won't be able to help.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.479
No, not that kind of doctor.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.199
Isn't that incredible,
don't you think, Amy?

06:41.280 --> 06:43.879
- Absolutely. One of my favourites.
- One of my favourite whats?

06:43.960 --> 06:46.839
- You've never seen my work before.
- Ah, yes.

06:46.920 --> 06:51.039
One of my favourite paintings
that I've ever seen. Generally.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.679
Then you can't have seen
many paintings, then.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.679
I know it's terrible.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.599
It's the best I could do.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.839
Your hair is orange.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.999
Yes. So's yours.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.639
Yes.

07:09.720 --> 07:14.999
It was more orange,
but now is, of course...less.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.919
So, Vincent,
painted any churches recently?

07:19.000 --> 07:23.399
Any churchy plans? Are churches,
chapels, religiousy stuff like that,

07:23.480 --> 07:26.279
something you'd like to get into?
You know, fairly soon?

07:26.360 --> 07:30.999
Well, there is one church I'm thinking
of painting when the weather is right.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.679
That is very good news.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.239
- (SCREAMING)
- WOMAN: She's been murdered!

07:35.320 --> 07:36.359
Help me!

07:36.440 --> 07:38.319
That, on the other hand,
isn't quite such good news.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.479
Come on, Amy, Vincent!

07:42.760 --> 07:45.399
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

07:45.480 --> 07:47.599
MAN: She's been ripped to shreds!

07:49.400 --> 07:52.439
- Please, let me look. I'm a doctor.
- Who is it?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.519
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.159
MAN: Is she dead?

07:58.240 --> 08:03.039
Away, all of you vultures!
This is my daughter. Giselle.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.839
What monster could have done this?

08:05.920 --> 08:07.759
- Get away from her!
- OK, OK.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.519
Get that madman out of here!

08:09.600 --> 08:11.919
(HUBBUB)

08:14.440 --> 08:18.519
You bring this on us. Your madness!
You!

08:18.600 --> 08:19.879
He's to blame!

08:26.320 --> 08:27.319
Are you all right?

08:28.640 --> 08:31.399
VINCENT: Yes, I'm used to it.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.639
Has anything like this murder
happened here before?

08:33.720 --> 08:35.919
Only a week ago.
It's a terrible time.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.679
As I thought, as I thought.
Come on, we'd better get you home.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.319
- Where are you staying tonight?
- Oh, you're very kind.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.599
(AMY LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

08:52.120 --> 08:54.839
(DEEP SNORTING)

08:54.920 --> 08:58.759
- DOCTOR: Dark night, very starry.
- VINCENT: It's not much.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.199
I live on my own.

09:01.280 --> 09:05.239
But you should be OK for one night.
One night.

09:05.320 --> 09:09.039
- We're going to stay with him?
- Until he paints that church.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.279
- Watch out. That one's wet.
- What?

09:28.400 --> 09:30.359
Sorry about all the clutter.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.839
Some clutter.

09:33.880 --> 09:37.399
I've come to accept the only person
who's going to love my paintings is me.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.919
Wow.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.159
I mean, really. Wow.

09:41.240 --> 09:44.639
Yeah, I know, it's a mess.
I'll have a proper clear-out.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.039
I must, I really must.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.759
Coffee, anyone?

10:00.840 --> 10:02.319
DOCTOR: Not for me, actually.

10:03.800 --> 10:09.479
You know, you should be careful
with these. They're...precious.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.359
Precious to me.
Not precious to anyone else.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.999
AMY: They're precious to me!

10:14.080 --> 10:17.519
Well, you're very kind.
And kindness is most welcome.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.359
Right, so, this church, then.
Near here, is it?

10:21.440 --> 10:23.679
What is it with you and the church?

10:23.760 --> 10:26.159
Oh, just casually interested in it,
you know.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.879
Far from casual. Seems to me
you never talk about anything else.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.239
He's a strange one.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.279
OK, let's talk about you.
What are you interested in?

10:35.360 --> 10:38.719
Well, look around - art.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.639
It seems to me there's so much more

10:41.720 --> 10:44.239
to the world than the average eye
is allowed to see.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.359
I believe, if you look hard,

10:46.440 --> 10:50.279
there are more wonders in this universe

10:50.360 --> 10:52.879
than you could ever have dreamed of.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.879
You don't have to tell me.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.759
It's colour. Colour that holds the key.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.599
I can hear the colours.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.679
Listen to them.

11:03.760 --> 11:08.039
Every time I step outside,
I feel nature is shouting at me,

11:08.120 --> 11:10.279
"Come on. Come and get me. Come on.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.119
"Come on! Capture my mystery!"

11:14.680 --> 11:16.359
Maybe you've had enough coffee now.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.599
How about some nice calming tea?

11:18.680 --> 11:21.919
Let's get you a cup of camomile
or something, shall we? Amy?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.239
- Where's Amy?

No, no. No!

11:29.480 --> 11:30.599
What happened?

11:30.680 --> 11:32.239
I don't know, I didn't see it.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.559
I was having a look at the paintings out
here when something hit me from behind.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.319
It's OK.
He's gone now, and we're here.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.679
No!

11:38.720 --> 11:41.639
Take it easy. Take it easy!

11:41.720 --> 11:43.719
What's happening? What's he doing?

11:43.800 --> 11:45.279
I don't know!

Oh, dear.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.399

11:51.480 --> 11:53.039
Run. Run!

11:53.120 --> 11:54.879
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's not a bad idea.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.319
Amy, get back.
He's having some kind of fit.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.559
I'll try to calm him down.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.959
Easy, Vincent, easy.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.119
Look, look. It's me, it's me, it's me.
It's the Doctor, look.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.799
No-one else is here. So, Vincent...

12:18.360 --> 12:20.199
That is a good question.

12:20.280 --> 12:23.039
- Let me help you.
- You can see him too?

12:23.120 --> 12:24.919
Yes...ish.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.799
Well, no. Not really.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.959
(CREATURE ROARS)

13:07.760 --> 13:09.239
Right.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.279
So he's invisible? What did he look like?

13:12.360 --> 13:13.319
I'll show you.

Oh, no, no, no!

- It's just... That was quite a good...

Right.
Amy, make Mr Van Gogh comfortable.

in through the front door.

Don't worry, I'll risk it.
What's the worst that can happen?

13:59.200 --> 14:01.079
You could get torn into pieces
by a monster you can't see.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.759

to thank you for saving me last night.

Ah!

18:03.760 --> 18:05.639
I thought you might like, you know,

18:05.720 --> 18:09.599
possibly to perhaps paint them
or something? Might be a thought.

18:09.680 --> 18:10.719
Yes.
Well, they're not my favourite flower.

18:10.800 --> 18:14.439
- You don't like sunflowers?
- No, it's not that I don't like them.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.599
I find them complex.

Always somewhere between
living and dying.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.919
Half-human as they turn to the sun.
A little disgusting.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.559
But, you know,

18:25.640 --> 18:27.319
they are a challenge.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.999
And one I'm pretty sure you'll rise to.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.679
But, moving on,
there's something I need to show you.

18:34.160 --> 18:36.039
VINCENT: That's him!

18:36.120 --> 18:37.399
And the eyes.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.159
Without mercy.

18:39.240 --> 18:42.959
This is a creature called the Krafayis.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.399
They travel in space,
they travel as a pack.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.759
Scavenging across the universe.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.799
Sometimes one of them gets left behind,

18:49.880 --> 18:52.759
and because they are a brutal race,
the others never come back.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.399
So, dotted all around the universe
are individual,

18:56.480 --> 18:59.959
utterly merciless,
utterly abandoned Krafayis.

19:00.040 --> 19:03.599
And what they do is...
Well, kill, until they're killed.

19:03.680 --> 19:07.119
Which they usually aren't.
Because other creatures can't see them.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.599
- But I can.
- Yes. And that's why

19:09.680 --> 19:14.679

painting the church today?

- OK. I'll get my things.
- In your own time.

of your hair by this time tomorrow.

- Riskier than normal?

the net result of our pleasant little trip

of the greatest artist who ever lived.

- Then your experience is incomplete.

I'm not sure I do.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.119
OK. OK!

22:44.200 --> 22:47.119
So, now, we must have a plan.
When the creature returns...

22:47.200 --> 22:49.239
Then we shall fight him again.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.439
Well, yes, tick.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.479
But last night we were lucky.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.879
Amy could have been killed.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.319
So this time, for a start, we have
to make sure I can see him too.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.079
And how are we meant to do that,
suddenly?

23:03.160 --> 23:06.919
The answer's in this box. I had
an excellent, if smelly, godmother.

23:10.880 --> 23:14.599
VINCENT: Oh, no.
It's that poor girl from the village.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.439

23:37.520 --> 23:40.079
No.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.799

but with more greyness.

if you see any, you know, monsters.

23:55.640 --> 23:59.719

I'm not stupid.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.439
No, quite.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.439
And, to be honest...

24:06.160 --> 24:08.359
I'm not sure about mad either.

Paint!

24:22.880 --> 24:24.359
Do painting!

24:26.360 --> 24:29.839
I remember watching Michelangelo
painting the Sistine Chapel.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.759
Wow! What a whinger. I kept saying to him,

24:32.840 --> 24:35.719
"Look, if you're scared of heights,
you shouldn't have taken the job."

29:35.920 --> 29:37.639
Duck! Left!

29:38.960 --> 29:41.159
- (AMY SCREAMS)
- Right, sorry.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.199
Agh!

29:42.280 --> 29:43.919
Your right, my left.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.319
This is no good at all.
Run like crazy and regroup.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.799
Oh, come on, in here.

30:02.680 --> 30:04.319
Right. OK.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.839
- Here's the plan. Amy, Rory...
- Who?

30:06.920 --> 30:08.879
Sorry, um, Vincent.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.879
- What is the plan?
- I don't know, actually.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.239
My only definite plan is that in future,

30:12.320 --> 30:14.159
I'm just using this screwdriver
for screwing in screws.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.679
Give me a second. I'll be back.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.519
- I suppose we could try talking to him.
- Talking to him?!

30:20.600 --> 30:22.959
Well, yes. Might be interesting
to know his side of the story.

30:23.040 --> 30:23.999
(ROARING)

30:24.080 --> 30:27.519
Yes, though maybe he's not really
in the mood for conversation

30:27.600 --> 30:29.279
right at this precise moment.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.399
(BANGING AND GROWLING)

30:33.120 --> 30:36.799
Well, no harm trying. Listen.
Listen!

30:38.800 --> 30:40.439
I know you can understand me.

30:40.560 --> 30:44.879
Even though I know you won't
understand whyyou can understand me.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.239
I also know that no-one's talked to you
for a pretty long stretch,

30:49.320 --> 30:52.719
but please...listen.

30:54.960 --> 30:57.679
I also don't belong on this planet.

30:57.760 --> 31:01.239
I also am...alone.

31:02.320 --> 31:06.199
If you trust me, I'm sure
we can come to some kind of, you know,

31:06.280 --> 31:07.839
understanding.

31:07.920 --> 31:11.559
And then... And then, who knows?

31:11.640 --> 31:13.879
(SHATTERING)

31:17.200 --> 31:20.799
(ROARING)

31:22.160 --> 31:23.639
Over here, mate!

31:25.320 --> 31:26.999
What's it up to now?

31:27.080 --> 31:30.159
It's moving round the room.
Feeling its way around.

31:32.120 --> 31:35.079
- What?
- It's like it's trapped.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.159
It's moving round
the edges of the room.

31:39.720 --> 31:42.639
AMY: I can't see a thing.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.119
I am really stupid.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.799
Oh, get a grip! This is not a moment
to re-evaluate your self-esteem.

31:49.880 --> 31:54.279
No, I am really stupid
and I'm growing old.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.799
Why does it attack,
but never eat its victims?

31:56.880 --> 31:59.319
And why was it abandoned by its pack
and left here to die?

31:59.400 --> 32:04.519
And why is it feeling its way helplessly
around the walls of the room?

32:04.600 --> 32:07.199
It can't see, it's blind.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.599
And that, of course, explains
why it has such perfect hearing!

32:09.680 --> 32:12.199
Which unfortunately also
explains why it is now

32:12.280 --> 32:14.799
turning around
and heading straight for us.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.839
Vincent. Vincent, what's happening?

32:16.920 --> 32:19.679
It's charging now.
Get back. Get back!

32:22.160 --> 32:23.199
Wah!

32:26.240 --> 32:29.159

- Argh!

32:31.080 --> 32:35.479
(WAILING)

32:39.640 --> 32:41.719
He wasn't without mercy at all.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.399
He was without sight.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.479
I didn't mean that to happen.

32:46.560 --> 32:49.399
I only meant to wound it,
I never meant to...

32:49.480 --> 32:51.679
(GURGLING)

32:51.760 --> 32:53.399
He's trying to say something.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.839
What is it?

32:56.920 --> 33:00.399
I'm having trouble making it out,
but I think he's saying,

33:00.480 --> 33:04.359
"I'm afraid. I'm afraid."

33:08.480 --> 33:10.119
There, there.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.479
Ssh! Ssh!

33:11.560 --> 33:15.519
It's OK. It's OK. You'll be fine. Ssh!

33:18.560 --> 33:21.639
(SIGHS)

33:26.440 --> 33:28.959
He was frightened.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.799
And he lashed out

33:30.880 --> 33:35.119
like humans, who lash out
when they're frightened.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.399
Like the villagers who scream at me.

33:38.960 --> 33:41.519
Like the children
who throw stones at me.

33:43.400 --> 33:47.759
You know, sometimes winning -
winning is no fun at all.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.559
Hold my hand, Doctor.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.479
Try to see what I see.

34:13.560 --> 34:17.639
We are so lucky we are still alive
to see this beautiful world.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.159
Look at the sky.

34:19.240 --> 34:23.999
It's not dark and black
and without character.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.119
The black is in fact deep blue.

34:26.200 --> 34:29.279
And over there, lighter blue.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.119
And blowing through
the blueness and the blackness,

34:32.200 --> 34:34.399
the wind swirling through the air

34:34.480 --> 34:38.359
and then shining, burning,
bursting through - the stars!

34:38.440 --> 34:40.759
Can you see
how they roar their light?

34:42.400 --> 34:44.759
Everywhere we look,

34:44.840 --> 34:49.079
the complex magic of nature
blazes before our eyes.

34:51.640 --> 34:54.319
I've seen many things, my friend.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.799
But you're right.

34:57.800 --> 35:02.399
Nothing quite as wonderful
as the things you see.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.559
I will miss you terribly.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.959
I only wish I had something
of real value to give you.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.599
(DOCTOR GIGGLES)

35:31.680 --> 35:36.919
Oh, no, no. I could never accept
such an extraordinary gift.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.359
Very well.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.439
You are not the first
to decline the offer.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.399
Amy, the blessed, the wonderful.

35:45.960 --> 35:49.599
Be good to yourself
and be kind to yourself.

35:49.680 --> 35:50.959
I'll try my best.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.119
And maybe give the beard a little trim
before you next kiss someone.

35:54.200 --> 35:57.399
(LAUGHS) I will. I will.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.639
And if you tire
of this Doctor of yours, return.

35:59.720 --> 36:02.639
- And we will have children by the dozen.
- Eek!

36:04.200 --> 36:05.679
Doctor, my friend...

36:05.760 --> 36:09.399
we have fought monsters together
and we have won.

36:09.480 --> 36:13.679
On my own,
I fear I may not do as well.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.319
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

36:30.400 --> 36:32.919
I was thinking I may need some food
or something before we leave.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.159
Well, no, you're not thinking
exactly what I'm thinking.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.719
Vincent!

36:40.560 --> 36:43.559
Got something I'd like to show you.

36:43.640 --> 36:45.799
Maybe just tidy yourself up
a bit first.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.919
Now, you know we've had quite
a few chats about the possibility

36:53.000 --> 36:56.199
there might be more to life
than normal people imagine?

36:56.280 --> 36:58.319
Yes.

36:58.400 --> 37:02.279
- Well, brace yourself, Vinny.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.799
How come I'm the crazy one...

37:32.880 --> 37:35.319
and you two have stayed sane?

37:39.960 --> 37:44.079
- What do these things all do?
- Oh, a huge variety of things.

(DISTORTED ZOOMING)

37:55.920 --> 37:58.199
And this one makes
everything go absolutely tonto.

of the universe.

Good idea.

I'd like to show you first.

Musée d'Orsay.

- Yes.

the Church At Auvers.

- Oh, yes. Glad to be of help.
- You were nice about my tie.

40:05.640 --> 40:08.679
Yes. And today is another cracker,
if I may say so.

40:08.760 --> 40:12.599
But I just wondered,
between you and me, in 1 00 words,

40:12.680 --> 40:16.879
where do you think Van Gogh rates
in the history of art?

40:16.960 --> 40:21.359
Well, um...big question.

40:21.440 --> 40:25.439
But, to me, Van Gogh
is the finest painter of them all.

40:25.520 --> 40:31.159
Certainly, the most popular
great painter of all time,

40:31.240 --> 40:32.719
the most beloved.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.399
His command of colour,
the most magnificent.

40:35.520 --> 40:41.959
He transformed the pain of
his tormented life into ecstatic beauty.

40:42.040 --> 40:46.639
Pain is easy to portray,
but to use your passion and pain

40:46.720 --> 40:51.639
to portray the ecstasy and joy
and magnificence of our world -

40:51.720 --> 40:53.359
no-one had ever done it before.

40:53.440 --> 40:56.479
Perhaps no-one ever will again.

40:56.560 --> 41:02.999
To my mind, that strange, wild man
who roamed the fields of Provence

41:03.080 --> 41:06.199
was not only the world's
greatest artist,

41:06.280 --> 41:11.279
but also one of the greatest men
who ever lived.

41:13.720 --> 41:17.759
Vincent. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Is it too much?

41:18.840 --> 41:22.879

Come on!

43:18.560 --> 43:22.479
DR BLACK: We have here the last work
of Vincent Van Gogh,

43:22.560 --> 43:25.439
who committed suicide at only 37.

43:25.520 --> 43:29.559
He is now acknowledged to be
one of the foremost artists of all time.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.839
If you follow me now...

43:35.600 --> 43:38.639
So you were right.
No new paintings.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.359
We didn't make a difference at all.

43:43.440 --> 43:46.359
I wouldn't say that.

43:46.440 --> 43:52.479
The way I see it, every life is
a pile of good things and bad things.

43:52.560 --> 43:53.759
Hey.

43:55.160 --> 43:59.679
The good things don't always...
soften the bad things.

43:59.800 --> 44:02.879
But vice versa - the bad things
don't necessarily spoil the good things

44:02.960 --> 44:05.119
or make them unimportant.

44:06.400 --> 44:10.319
And we definitely added
to his pile of good things.

44:11.640 --> 44:15.119
And if you look carefully...

44:15.200 --> 44:19.639
maybe we did indeed make
a couple of little changes.

44:22.160 --> 44:25.559
