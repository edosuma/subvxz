00:57.976 --> 01:04.438
[kissing]

01:04.522 --> 01:06.651
This would be perfect if Iwasn't afraid I was going to

01:06.776 --> 01:08.068

01:08.152 --> 01:11.155

01:19.079 --> 01:20.164
Yeah?

01:20.248 --> 01:21.082
Mhm.

01:21.332 --> 01:22.792
I thought you said therewere no girls before me.

01:22.875 --> 01:27.714
No, what I said was there wereno great loves before you.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.591
I wish I was your8th grade girlfriend.

01:30.675 --> 01:33.594
I bet you were so adorable.

01:33.678 --> 01:35.972
But that might bebroken up by now.

01:36.055 --> 01:39.475
I don't plan on everbreaking up with you.

01:39.559 --> 01:42.437
I don't care whenwe would have met.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.355
Whenever we laid eyes oneach other we would have

01:44.480 --> 01:47.525
fallen madly in love.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.777
You're a hopeless romantic.

01:49.861 --> 01:51.696
Admit it, it's true.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.698
Right, whenever we laid eyeson each other we would have

01:53.824 --> 01:56.868
fallen madly in love.

01:58.162 --> 02:00.663
Say it like you mean it!

02:02.499 --> 02:05.752
Whenever we laid eyes oneach other we would have

02:05.877 --> 02:09.465
fallen hopelessly,completely in love.

02:09.548 --> 02:10.673
Better.

02:10.757 --> 02:15.887
[kissing]

02:16.012 --> 02:19.390
All right, so why did it takeyou so long to find me, huh?

02:19.474 --> 02:22.685
Perhaps because you werebusy marrying someone else.

02:22.769 --> 02:25.773
How could you let me makesuch a stupid mistake?

02:25.898 --> 02:26.815
I didn't even know you.

02:26.899 --> 02:29.108
My point exactly.

02:29.234 --> 02:30.235
You're right.

02:30.402 --> 02:32.445
I'm sorry; I shouldhave found you earlier.

02:32.570 --> 02:34.280
You should have.

02:38.077 --> 02:40.788
Well maybe I can makeit up to you right now.

02:40.913 --> 02:42.706
Oh yeah?

03:02.726 --> 03:04.269
What just happened in there?

03:04.394 --> 03:06.563
Do you really think aftereverything I went through in

03:06.647 --> 03:09.525
my first marriage that I'dbe prepared to do it again?

03:09.608 --> 03:11.485
Yeah, I hope so.

03:11.610 --> 03:13.278
Doug was awful.

03:13.404 --> 03:14.780
It was a nightmare!

03:14.863 --> 03:16.782
I'm not asking youto marry Doug baby,

03:16.865 --> 03:18.283
I'm asking you to marry me.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.953
It's all the same.

03:21.079 --> 03:23.747
Sorry, I didn't meanit the way it sounded.

03:23.831 --> 03:27.543
It's just...it'll end withsomeone's heart being

03:27.626 --> 03:30.588
completely shattered and Ican't sign up for that again.

03:30.672 --> 03:32.673
What are you saying?

03:32.798 --> 03:34.299
It's me, it's George.

I don't have a wife, youdon't have a husband and we

03:47.563 --> 03:49.189
don't have marriedand forever.

03:49.314 --> 03:51.650
Did you know that foreverlasts no longer than a year

03:51.733 --> 03:53.527
and usually ends in divorce?

03:53.652 --> 03:54.611
Well not if you marrythe right person.

03:54.696 --> 03:57.323
Really, how canyou be so sure?

03:57.448 --> 04:01.995
I've never been so sureof anything in my life.

04:02.077 --> 04:06.833
I just...I don'thave that luxury.

04:06.916 --> 04:08.501
I don't wantanybody but you.

04:08.626 --> 04:09.627
Nothing's going to change.

04:09.711 --> 04:11.296
I don't want anyonebut you either,

04:11.379 --> 04:13.089
that's what I'mtrying to tell you.

04:13.173 --> 04:17.969

04:27.145 --> 04:29.647

04:29.731 --> 04:32.942
I thought Dougloved me, you know.

04:33.026 --> 04:36.404
But all he wanted was a wifewho was smart enough to take

04:36.529 --> 04:38.740
to business dinners and dumbenough not to know he was

04:38.865 --> 04:41.201
messing aroundall over town.

04:41.285 --> 04:44.245
Do you love me Janie?

We're us; we'remeant to be together.

Dear Jane, mymother-in-law's a very sweet

08:13.331 --> 08:15.125
woman and we'vealways gotten along.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.585
In December she's havingsurgery and my husband wants

08:17.669 --> 08:20.089
her to stay with usfor the holidays.

08:20.172 --> 08:23.007
We usually stay with myfamily at that time of the year

08:23.092 --> 08:25.761
and I'm not sure how they'regoing to feel about this.

08:25.886 --> 08:28.305
How should I handle thissituation without upsetting

08:28.431 --> 08:29.557
my parents?

08:29.640 --> 08:32.893
Signed, a little mixed up.

08:35.354 --> 08:39.441
Dear Mixed up: Divorceseems the only alternative.

08:39.525 --> 08:42.403
Your husband's inconsideraterequest shows that he puts

08:42.486 --> 08:44.113
his mother before you.

08:44.196 --> 08:48.784
This is unacceptable,sincerely, Dear Jane.

08:48.909 --> 08:50.494
I can't print those.

08:50.619 --> 08:52.455
They're like those whackedout answers you wrote when

08:52.580 --> 08:55.249
you and Doug broke up.

08:55.332 --> 08:57.960
All right, here it is.

08:58.085 --> 08:59.545
George and I got engaged.

08:59.628 --> 09:02.673

09:49.095 --> 09:50.555
Well look atthe bright side,

09:50.680 --> 09:52.933
at least your mother won'tbe sitting Shiva this time.

Thank you, thanks for that.

09:57.978 --> 10:00.690

10:04.860 --> 10:06.905
She's had a Jane's 2ndwedding file since before my

10:07.030 --> 10:09.783

10:11.409 --> 10:13.578
Mary says I'm nervous nowand I shouldn't be and I

10:13.703 --> 10:16.206
should have been withDoug and I wasn't.

10:16.289 --> 10:18.124
She never liked him did she?

10:18.208 --> 10:20.794
No, always thoughthe was a jerk.

10:20.877 --> 10:23.171
You know I didn't even getit when he showed up half an

10:23.255 --> 10:25.423
hour late for ourwedding rehearsal.

10:25.549 --> 10:27.300
Well how could you know hewas in the honeymoon suite

10:27.385 --> 10:29.929
doing it with thewedding coordinator?

10:30.054 --> 10:32.055
Oh, I don't know.

10:32.138 --> 10:34.975
You know I swear I saw him winkat her during the ceremony.

10:35.058 --> 10:36.060
I'm not kidding.

10:36.351 --> 10:38.854
Well as long as your mom isour wedding coordinator,

10:38.937 --> 10:41.190
I can prettymuch guarantee history is

10:41.274 --> 10:43.275

Very funny.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.501
Hey, you didn't make a wish.

11:00.585 --> 11:02.669
I didn't want to be greedy.

11:02.753 --> 11:04.964
Mine already came true.

11:05.088 --> 11:06.674
Ah.

11:06.756 --> 11:08.550
All right, you're right,you're absolutely right.

It's so nice to see you,I'm glad you could make it.

11:19.770 --> 11:25.443
You know, marriage is notsomething you enter into

11:25.526 --> 11:28.237
frivolously, youknow what I mean?

11:28.321 --> 11:30.865
It involves avery sacred vow.

11:30.948 --> 11:32.867
The vows that Itake with George,

11:32.950 --> 11:36.662
I will honor allthe days of my life.

11:36.787 --> 11:39.540
My mommy says that yourfirst marriage was a disaster

11:39.624 --> 11:43.628
and that $100 weddinggift was a big waste of money.

11:43.753 --> 11:45.713
And daddy says he's notgetting into that monkey

11:45.796 --> 11:49.717
suit again foranybody, not even you.

29:54.230 --> 29:57.984
No, no, the paperdelivery office job.

29:58.067 --> 30:00.445
Well that's usually reservedfor someone who still lives

30:00.570 --> 30:02.572
at home with his parents.

30:02.697 --> 30:04.407
I just want to be in thenewspaper industry and I'm

30:04.490 --> 30:07.493

very strong feeling when Iwalked in that this is where

30:28.347 --> 30:29.515
I'm supposed to be.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.352

30:52.331 --> 30:56.460
Here's a list of all thedelivery locations and I'm

31:17.815 --> 31:20.734

31:20.818 --> 31:22.903
Jane I know we've only knowneach other for a few hours

31:22.986 --> 31:24.321

31:26.574 --> 31:29.118
Sure, I'll give the guy I'vebeen mad about since college

31:29.202 --> 31:32.996
to marry you, an overgrowncirculation engineer.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.706
Jane I'm not going tobeat around the bush.

31:34.832 --> 31:36.667
I've come from the futurewhere we're in love so we

31:36.792 --> 31:38.418
can fall in lovein the past.

31:38.502 --> 31:40.045
You must marry me.

31:40.170 --> 31:43.842
That'll work.

31:45.134 --> 31:48.221
Jane, marry me before I have aheart attack.

31:48.346 --> 31:49.848
Yeah, I alwaysfound the sympathy

31:49.973 --> 31:51.265

32:01.024 --> 32:02.068
I didn't mean to do that.

32:02.360 --> 32:03.945
What are you talking about?Your ideas were great.

32:04.028 --> 32:05.237
Well that's thething Harvey,

32:05.363 --> 32:06.489

32:06.573 --> 32:08.490
They were a whole bunchof other peoples'.

32:08.574 --> 32:10.201
I don't like it whenthe crazy talk starts.

32:10.284 --> 32:11.703
Harvey you shouldshow him your ideas;

32:11.786 --> 32:13.829
your ideas are great.

32:13.912 --> 32:16.249
How would you know?

32:16.373 --> 32:20.128
Crazy people know things.

32:23.673 --> 32:31.514
Look, if you change yourmind call me any time.

32:31.598 --> 32:34.683

You're welcome.

33:28.988 --> 33:29.949
Do you want to hear it?Mhm.

33:30.241 --> 33:34.411
Okay, I predict and myangel guide assures me,

33:34.495 --> 33:37.580
in the spirit of inclusionand enlightenment that our

33:37.664 --> 33:44.380
next president willdefinitely be a woman.

33:44.462 --> 33:47.383
It's her 10% success rate thatgives her such confidence.

33:47.466 --> 33:50.551
Pay no attention toher, I am very accurate.

33:50.635 --> 33:52.221

33:58.519 --> 34:01.063
It's not like there areany rules or anything.

34:01.146 --> 34:04.775
Uh, I don't think I'dbe any good at it.

34:04.858 --> 34:07.987
George, George, if you want tobe in the newspaper business

34:08.070 --> 34:10.906

34:31.510 --> 34:34.554
It's just...it has tobe somewhat realistic.

34:34.681 --> 34:36.348
You want to try again?

34:36.433 --> 34:39.185

50:12.796 --> 50:15.674
That's really sweet.

50:16.466 --> 50:17.758
Thanks.

50:17.841 --> 50:20.971
So George, you can't reallyturn down that advertising

50:21.053 --> 50:22.305

50:23.806 --> 50:24.848

50:28.936 --> 50:32.023
Maybe you'll becomethe next Dear Abby.

50:32.148 --> 50:33.817
Sounds good to me.

50:33.900 --> 50:36.152
Although right now I wish Iwas a little more Elizabeth

50:36.277 --> 50:38.612
Barrett Browning, but...

50:38.697 --> 50:40.239
Why is that?

50:40.322 --> 50:45.704
Well sort of trying to writeDoug a poem for the ceremony

50:45.829 --> 50:48.415
and it's not going well.

50:48.498 --> 50:51.793
Turns out it's a lot harderthan one would think.

50:51.876 --> 50:53.837
You know he's not going tolike it if its too romantic

50:53.920 --> 50:55.380
or mushy or...

50:55.505 --> 50:58.174
Well maybe I could help.

50:58.258 --> 50:59.467
Really?

50:59.551 --> 51:02.345
Okay, go ahead.

51:02.429 --> 51:05.516
Something not too mushyfor an unromantic groom.

51:05.640 --> 51:06.891
Okay, I didn't say that.

51:07.017 --> 51:11.229
Just you know,not too much...

51:11.354 --> 51:15.191
Roses are red,violets are blue,

51:15.275 --> 51:21.531
I hadn't met my soul matewhen I said I'd marry you.

51:21.656 --> 51:23.241
Maybe a littlemushier than that.

51:23.366 --> 51:24.452
More mushy?

51:24.535 --> 51:29.080
Yeah a little bit.

51:29.205 --> 51:34.669
Well it may not beverse but here goes.

51:34.753 --> 51:39.049
If I was marrying the womanof my dreams on Saturday,

51:39.175 --> 51:43.303
I would tell her that she isthe only woman in the world

51:43.386 --> 51:46.806
with whom I could spendthe rest of my life.

51:46.891 --> 51:50.935
And that once I found herewe'd really have no choice

51:51.061 --> 51:55.941
but to be together no matterthe place...

51:56.067 --> 51:59.904
no matter the time...

51:59.987 --> 52:02.656
Lucky girl.

52:03.574 --> 52:06.077

52:06.202 --> 52:08.788

What did you say?

54:54.539 --> 54:55.581

54:55.747 --> 54:58.709

55:02.630 --> 55:06.509
To my assertive training...

56:56.078 --> 56:58.205

Then one day she was gone.

57:11.343 --> 57:14.931
What was she like?

57:15.056 --> 57:20.395
Beautiful, smart,funny, a little nutty.

57:23.397 --> 57:26.401
No one every made mefeel the way she did.

57:28.861 --> 57:30.780
That's so sad.

57:34.992 --> 57:37.953
She broke my heart.

57:41.749 --> 57:45.461
You're too sweet tohave your heart broken.

57:45.586 --> 57:49.173

01:12:24.475 --> 01:12:25.642
Hold your tongue?

01:12:27.561 --> 01:12:28.562

01:12:28.896 --> 01:12:30.773
Yeah, but I never really gotto say what I needed to say

01:12:30.856 --> 01:12:34.318

01:12:34.401 --> 01:12:38.155

Don't settle for Doug,especially now that you've

01:13:07.101 --> 01:13:10.355
glimpsed a future in whichthere is the kind of love

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.776
