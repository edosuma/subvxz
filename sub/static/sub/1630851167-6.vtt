I'm sorry if I scared you, man.

01:31.007 --> 01:34.344

01:56.449 --> 01:58.409
Uh, coffee.

01:59.035 --> 02:03.081
Coffee. So it's good that you didn't get
me one because I definitely don't need it.

02:03.164 --> 02:06.042
Oh, great. I'm glad
I don't have to feel bad about it, then.

It's your first day, and you're nervous.

Just follow my lead

02:36.781 --> 02:38.408
I will. Absolutely.

Well, not that, let's hope.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.757
Yeah, maybe we should
stop focusing on ways for you

03:35.840 --> 03:38.760
to avoid taking responsibility
for your future disappearance.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.722
Well, the first two are acts of God.
So technically I am taking responsibility.

03:42.805 --> 03:47.852
Okay, then let's start thinking about Rory
and how she's feeling.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.271
Odd. That's what Maze said.

03:51.773 --> 03:52.982
That is odd.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.527
Anyway, the fact of the matter
is Rory feels abandoned.

03:56.611 --> 04:00.949
[sighs] Yes, and I'm not sure I have
the right to even be God, father to all,

04:01.032 --> 04:02.825
if my own daughter feels neglected.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.495
So how can I possibly fix things?

04:06.621 --> 04:07.789
Hang on.

04:07.872 --> 04:10.166
You abandoned your daughter,
and she doesn't hate you.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.377
-How did you pull that off?
-Well…

04:13.378 --> 04:14.796
you know the story.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.840
I stalked her for a while,

04:17.924 --> 04:20.301
then worked diligently behind her back

on what you can do, moving forward.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.021
Spend time with her now.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.732
Because what you can't do
is go back in time

04:34.816 --> 04:38.653

and Christmases that you missed.

04:38.736 --> 04:39.612

I mean, I suppose it's possible
if you tried hard enough,

05:06.764 --> 05:08.599
given the self-actualization of it all.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.144
Don't be so literal, Doctor.

in the therapy session.

you know, that you killed him…

06:54.205 --> 06:55.581
that was because of me.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.708
That was my fault.

06:58.918 --> 06:59.961
And…

07:01.003 --> 07:03.631
from the sound of how you grew up, I just…

07:04.549 --> 07:07.927
It sounds like it really wasn't great.
[voice breaks] And I'm sorry.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.178

07:09.762 --> 07:12.098
Mom, you have nothing to apologize for.

to our relationship.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.147

you are, and always have been,

07:46.215 --> 07:48.301
But you don't know Lucifer.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.802
Not yet.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.220
So maybe just…

07:52.096 --> 07:54.515
give him a chance. He might surprise you.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.431

08:35.515 --> 08:38.643
The scene is secure. I also
assembled a list of possible witnesses.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.895
I'm assuming it includes
Nosy McNoserson over there?

08:42.480 --> 08:43.439
[Amenadiel] Mm-hmm.

08:44.148 --> 08:47.860
But more importantly, I think there may be
one prime witness unaccounted for.

08:47.944 --> 08:48.778
Yeah, who's that?

08:48.861 --> 08:52.365
Well, did you check out the bathroom?
Because I counted two toothbrushes.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.326
Maybe the deceased had a girlfriend
or roommate who saw something.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.244
What do you think?

08:56.327 --> 08:59.497

It matters what he thinks.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.126
Right. The detective.

-Right. Right. I'm sorry.

We're still gathering details,

10:04.979 --> 10:08.274
but from what we know,
the victim is Kevin Campbell, 26.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.817
He was shot in the chest.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.612
Apparently, assailant busted down
the door and started shooting.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.988
This neighborhood's a war zone.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.866
Had a gang shooting
around the corner just last week.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.285
Only a matter of time
before somebody retaliated.

10:20.870 --> 10:21.954
Wanna add something, rookie?

10:24.165 --> 10:27.460
Well, you know, it just doesn't look like
a gangbanger lives here.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.837
Well, things aren't always what they seem.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.422
Agreed.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.344
How big of a perimeter
would you like us to process?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.347
[exhales] Let's keep it
to the living room.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.058
No need to waste taxpayer dollars
when we already know what happened.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.480
-What about the bathroom?
-What about it?

10:49.690 --> 10:52.276
Well, I noticed there were
two toothbrushes on the sink,

10:52.360 --> 10:55.029
the door lock is busted
and the window wide open.

10:55.112 --> 10:58.616
Maybe someone was staying here,
and they used that window as an escape.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.784
Sure.

10:59.867 --> 11:02.119
Or maybe the Easter bunny
came in through that window.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.248
[chuckles] Let's put out a BOLO for
a fuzzy dude with big ears, buck teeth.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.796
Look, I get it. When you're a rookie,
every toothbrush looks like a clue.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.340
But the simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

11:14.423 --> 11:18.052
You spend enough time on the job,
you trust your instincts on where to look.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.137

You wanna keep wearing it?

11:31.607 --> 11:33.901
Don't ever question a CO
like you did in there.

11:33.984 --> 11:36.987
You don't understand.
I've had a run-in with that guy before.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.739
Reiben. He's a bad cop!

11:38.823 --> 11:40.783
No, you don't understand.
Reiben is our boss!

11:40.866 --> 11:43.119
They do teach chain of command
at the academy, right?

11:43.202 --> 11:46.163
Yes, but they also teach proper procedure,
and Reiben wasn't following it.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.666
Ah, you're killing me.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.585
I used to be like you.

rocking the boat. Look where it got me.

what gets processed and what doesn't,

[chuckling] Oh, Amenadiel! Hi!

12:29.582 --> 12:32.126
I didn't hear you come in there.
You are a stealthy one.

12:32.209 --> 12:35.755
It's like you just flew in or something.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.465
I need to talk to you.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.507
In confidence.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.052
Oh, absolutely, buddy.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.637
Okay, you can tell me anything,

out of this world it might seem.

Okay, thank you.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.194
Well, I was assisting
at a murder scene today--

12:58.277 --> 13:01.739
Mm-hmm, right, 'cause you're just
a regular old, run-of-the-mill uni, right?

13:01.822 --> 13:05.659
Well, I am a sworn officer
of the law. So, yeah.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.411
Anyway, I'm at the scene,

13:07.495 --> 13:11.332
and I just keep having this strange
feeling that something isn't right.

13:11.916 --> 13:15.836
Oh, I knew it! It's--
it's like a-- a divine jankiness, right?

13:15.920 --> 13:18.881
No,, it's more like a feeling that
someone else was in the apartment.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.718
Oh! You mean like a holy spirit?

13:22.802 --> 13:23.969
No.

13:24.053 --> 13:27.139
Like a roommate.
Or maybe even the vic's girlfriend.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.935
You see, there was a second toothbrush
and a bathroom window was left wide open.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.229
So I'm wondering
if maybe you could check it out?

13:33.896 --> 13:38.734
So, uh,
is this coming from a "higher power"?

13:38.818 --> 13:39.902
Definitely not.

13:39.985 --> 13:44.073
Just your old pal Amenadiel,
asking you for a little favor, cop to cop.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.923

17:30.007 --> 17:31.717

17:31.800 --> 17:33.844
to prevent
this sort of thing from happening.

17:33.927 --> 17:37.806
I mean, I would assume he went
through extensive sensitivity training.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.685

no more sensitive than he was before.

Because that takes some serious cojones.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.449
Yes, sir.

27:41.534 --> 27:45.413
See, the training manual says to
examine a scene from both inside and out,

27:45.497 --> 27:48.667
that evidence found leading up to
and away from a scene could be vital.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.753
And Miss Lopez did find something
outside that bathroom, sir.

27:52.796 --> 27:57.342
So, if you wanna reprimand me,
well, then you go right ahead.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.636

-The kind that owns up to his mistakes.

to say you made the right call.

I was barking up the right tree after all.

-Gang ties?
-Ran with one, back in high school.

That doesn't means she's the killer.

29:14.502 --> 29:15.962

29:16.838 --> 29:19.549

clipped her before she took off,

I put a target on the back
of an innocent Black woman.

36:40.364 --> 36:41.616
It's not your fault.

36:43.117 --> 36:45.494
But next time,
consider talking to me first.

36:45.578 --> 36:47.747
And do what, hmm? Nothing?

36:48.956 --> 36:52.210
While a bigot makes asinine assumptions
instead of doing his job?

36:52.293 --> 36:53.586
No, no.

36:55.963 --> 36:59.217
An investigator
is supposed to investigate, Harris.

36:59.300 --> 37:03.221
Look at evidence, talk to witnesses.
I mean… [scoffs]

37:03.304 --> 37:04.680
Do you see what's happening?

37:04.764 --> 37:07.808
Are you seriously trying to school me
after being here for a hot minute?

37:09.644 --> 37:14.690
-[exhales] I'm sorry, I just don't--
-I have a niece in first grade.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.360
I was asked
to do Career Day at her school.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.904
God, I was so excited
to empower these kids,

37:19.987 --> 37:22.823
especially the girls,
you know, that they could be like me.

37:23.449 --> 37:26.035
You know what I felt
when I set foot on that campus?

37:27.245 --> 37:28.120
Fear.

37:31.999 --> 37:35.544
These kids don't have the luxury
to separate the person from the uniform.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.256
This uniform took their mom away.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.968
This uniform killed their brother.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.140
They're terrified of us.

37:53.562 --> 37:57.942
And every day we give them
thousands of reasons why they should be.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.071
And, yeah…

38:05.116 --> 38:05.992
I see.

38:07.618 --> 38:09.578
But we have to try and change that.

38:09.662 --> 38:13.582
Yeah, but not by bulldozing
into the lieutenant's office.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.252
You gotta dance between the raindrops.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.838
You gotta be accessible,
be there every day.

38:18.921 --> 38:22.508
This is why I didn't wanna get broomed
into a cushy job in the Palisades.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.220
If I see another cop
pull over a person of color,

38:27.722 --> 38:28.848
I can watch.

38:30.224 --> 38:32.601
If I see something, I can say something.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.811
But carefully.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.981
-To the right person.
-To the right person?

38:38.899 --> 38:40.943
No. No, that can't be it.

38:41.027 --> 38:43.237
You're only one person, Harris.
You can't be everywhere.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.614
Yeah, well, there's the battles
and then there's the war,

38:45.698 --> 38:48.284
but, you know,
you don't have to worry about that yet.

38:48.367 --> 38:49.410
Yes, I do.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.037
No, you don't.

38:53.789 --> 38:55.833
I would think before taking my side.

38:57.251 --> 39:00.588
I'm kind of the kid who gets picked last
for dodgeball around here.

39:03.215 --> 39:07.261
Well, I don't know what dodgeball is,

39:07.345 --> 39:10.306
so whatever it is, I would pick you first.

39:12.141 --> 39:13.809
You're a weird one. [chuckles]

39:13.893 --> 39:15.019
But you're all right.

39:17.271 --> 39:18.439
[Amenadiel] Who's that?

39:18.522 --> 39:20.524
Let's just say I might know a guy.

39:27.531 --> 39:30.159
-Who's that?
-[Harris] New partner. You can trust him.

39:30.242 --> 39:32.870
Amenadiel, this is Dr. Lamotte.

39:32.953 --> 39:36.540
She runs a free clinic around the corner
from Kevin Campbell's apartment.

39:36.624 --> 39:39.126
Why don't you catch him up
on what you told me on the phone?

39:40.169 --> 39:44.048
Michaela came by the clinic yesterday.
She had a gunshot wound in the thigh.

39:44.548 --> 39:45.549
Close to the artery.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.719
She was bleeding pretty bad.
I patched her up the best I could.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.429
You know where she is now?

39:50.513 --> 39:52.056
No, but…

39:53.682 --> 39:55.184
I do have this.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.063
That's the slug
I pulled out of Michaela's thigh.

39:59.855 --> 40:02.441
Thank you, Doctor, for helping us and her.

40:02.525 --> 40:06.112
And, hey, if you talk to her again,
please give her my number.

40:09.532 --> 40:11.033
This is great.

40:11.659 --> 40:14.161
But how the hell are we gonna run this
without anyone finding out?

40:15.830 --> 40:16.997
I might know a guy.

40:18.707 --> 40:21.001
Okay. So ballistics ran the slug.

40:21.085 --> 40:24.672
Oh. Don't worry. Linus from night shift
did it, and he owes me big time

40:24.755 --> 40:27.842
for introducing him
to my amazing D&D squad.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.970
Anyway, the bullet not only matches

40:31.053 --> 40:33.264
the one found
in your victim, Kevin Campbell,

40:33.347 --> 40:37.518
but Linus rushed both
through NIBIN and got a hit.

40:38.185 --> 40:42.231
Nine millimeter, owned by
some scary-ass loan shark leg-breaker

40:42.314 --> 40:43.941
named Logan McCarthy.

40:44.024 --> 40:47.445
Now, apparently McCarthy
has a reputation for getting all shooty

40:47.528 --> 40:48.988
on yahoos who owe him money.

40:49.071 --> 40:51.657
I bet Sam the Snake
was one of those yahoos.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.869
The guy who lived
in Kevin Campbell's apartment before.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.078
[cell phone vibrates]

40:57.037 --> 40:58.038
Officer Harris.

40:58.122 --> 41:02.042
[woman] Dr. Lamotte gave me your number.
I-- I didn't know who else to call.

41:03.210 --> 41:06.255
-Michaela?
-Yeah, the doctor said I could trust you.

41:06.338 --> 41:08.507
You can. Are you all right?

41:08.591 --> 41:10.426
-Tell us where you are.
-Hiding.

41:10.509 --> 41:14.096
I'm scared. I went back to the clinic,
but he must have guessed I would,

41:14.180 --> 41:15.890
'cause he followed me when I left.

41:16.599 --> 41:19.018
Who? Who followed you?

41:19.977 --> 41:21.562
The man who killed Kevin.

41:21.645 --> 41:25.065
I saw him do it, and he knows I saw.
You have to help me.

41:26.609 --> 41:28.527
Of course, just tell us where you are.

41:28.611 --> 41:32.072
Inglewood Cemetery,
in the big mausoleum on the right.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.574
[fearfully] Hurry, please.

41:33.657 --> 41:36.535
Stay where you are,
we'll be right there. Let's roll.

42:57.199 --> 42:58.867
Don't shoot! Don't shoot, please.

43:00.869 --> 43:03.998
Michaela, it's Officer Harris.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.208
We spoke on the phone. Are you all right?

43:06.292 --> 43:08.002
-[Michaela gasps]
-[Harris] You okay?

43:08.085 --> 43:10.588
[Michaela sighs] Yeah, I just, uh…

43:10.671 --> 43:13.882
-I think I ripped my stitches.
-Okay, we need to get you out of here.

43:13.966 --> 43:16.135
-Ow.
-[Amenadiel] Is it your leg?

43:16.218 --> 43:17.720
He's out there.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.597
You didn't see him?

43:20.764 --> 43:21.932
I saw him.

43:23.559 --> 43:24.893
I'm not lying.

43:26.270 --> 43:27.855
And I saw him shoot Kevin.

43:31.817 --> 43:33.569
It was so loud.

43:34.570 --> 43:35.571
The gun.

43:36.989 --> 43:39.533
Kevin didn't even have a chance to react.

43:40.326 --> 43:42.244
I saw Kevin's head fall back,

43:42.870 --> 43:44.246
and I couldn't think.

43:44.330 --> 43:48.083
I-- I screamed,
and I ran into the bathroom,

43:48.167 --> 43:49.668
and I got out the window.

43:51.045 --> 43:53.047
And he came in and shot at me.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.052
[crying] I know
you think I did it, but I didn't.

43:59.887 --> 44:00.971
I would never…

44:01.847 --> 44:03.432
ever hurt Kevin.

44:05.851 --> 44:06.935
I loved him…

44:08.312 --> 44:11.273
so much. [sobbing]

44:15.027 --> 44:16.487
You have to believe me.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! She's the victim!
That man is the perpetrator.

-What are you doing? Take her down!

46:17.858 --> 46:19.401
I said get her! She's armed.

46:19.485 --> 46:22.613
-[whimpering softly]
-[Reiben] Get away from her, you idiot!

46:22.696 --> 46:24.907
No, I'm not gonna do that
because she's innocent.

46:24.990 --> 46:27.284
-That's our killer!
-No! I'm not gonna do that!

You did some good work.

47:57.499 --> 48:00.043

Do this?

48:07.092 --> 48:09.052
Because I don't think that I can.

-Not right? It was criminal.
