00:08.258 --> 00:09.926
<i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:

00:10.010 --> 00:12.303
How did Hiram Lodge pin
Cassidy Bullock's murder on me?

00:12.387 --> 00:16.099
He paid Mr. Bullock's friends
to say that they saw you pull the trigger.

00:16.182 --> 00:17.934
It's my understanding
that they're in hiding.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.978
I'd hide in the mines by Shadow Lake.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.480
The warden said if I did this, I'd ascend.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.400
You're breaking Archie out of juvie?

00:25.483 --> 00:27.736
We'll need a distraction
to disorient the guards

00:27.819 --> 00:30.488
-and hide Archie's play for the grate.
Find him!

00:30.572 --> 00:32.824
Right now!

00:32.907 --> 00:35.201
Joaquin
Back to the Serpents?

00:35.285 --> 00:36.995
-No, I joined a different gang.
-Game Master.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.708
Everyone in this room is part of a pact.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.377
No one knows of Archie's whereabouts,
capisce?

00:45.170 --> 00:46.796
Does Hiram Lodge own you, too?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.923
My soul belongs
to no mere mortal.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.676
He's watching us. He's always watching.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.140
Oh, Archie.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.769
What does it mean?

01:19.537 --> 01:21.831
How are we gonna get out of this mess?

01:24.876 --> 01:25.919
Betty.

01:26.878 --> 01:27.879
I saw him.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.631
The Gargoyle King.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.676
Jug. What the hell

01:33.760 --> 01:36.846
Yeah. As I was walking home.
I followed him into a clearing.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.891
<i>Betty, there were others.</i>
<i>There's like ten of them.</i>

01:39.974 --> 01:42.727
<i>They looked like his disciples.</i>
<i>Like they were worshiping the king.</i>

01:43.019 --> 01:44.729
-Oh, my God.
-They had on these masks.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.398
Like they were a gang.
A gang of gargoyles.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.526
-Let's go after them.
-No. We shouldn't push our luck.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.986
-Not until we know more.

01:52.904 --> 01:53.822
Joaquin.

02:01.704 --> 02:04.582
Joaquin told Kevin about a new gang.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.919
And then Joaquin ran into the woods.

02:09.379 --> 02:12.090
We know Warden Norton is playing G&amp;G.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.384
And Joaquin was doing his dirty work.

02:15.051 --> 02:18.847
Another piece of damning evidence that
Warden Norton could be our Gargoyle King.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.321
Where have you been, young lady?

02:35.822 --> 02:38.241
There's a manhunt
for Archie Andrews underway.

02:38.658 --> 02:42.287
Police with guns and dogs,
all over the streets of Riverdale.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.372
-No, Mom.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.958
We didn't hear
about his escape until this morning.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.837
The warden from that juvie
killed himself last night.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.006
What?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.008
How come?

02:55.091 --> 02:59.429
RIVW is reporting
that he was found with blue lips.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.393
So, he was playing G&amp;G.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.396
Mom, did you know Warden Norton?

03:09.063 --> 03:10.148
Why would you even ask that?

03:10.231 --> 03:14.194
Because he had ties to Hiram Lodge,
who played G&amp;G with you 25 years ago.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.820
Sure you don't remember him?

03:15.904 --> 03:17.906
Yes, I am sure, Elizabeth.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.074
I've told you everything that I know.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.459
I missed this.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.921
I missed you, Archie.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.012
Ronnie.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.269
I may know where the Shadow Lake boys are.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.856
The warden thought they were camping
in the abandoned mines.

03:51.940 --> 03:52.982
I need to get there.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.151
No, Archie, I don't think you understand.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.239
Outside this bunker,
there is a manhunt going on.

03:59.322 --> 04:05.036
Roadblocks, checkpoints, wanted posters,
with your strong jawline all over town.

04:05.119 --> 04:09.165
I need to find those witnesses.
Warden said all three guys were paid off.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.417
They're the only ones
who can clear my name.

04:11.751 --> 04:12.919
So I can stop running.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.004
Paid off by my father, no doubt.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.594
Archie.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.846
This is a long shot, but...

04:24.347 --> 04:28.309
when Betty was working with Attorney McCoy
and your mom, that was at your house?

04:28.393 --> 04:29.227
Yeah.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.689
Are the case files still there?

04:32.772 --> 04:34.857
Yeah, but they've been through them all.

04:35.817 --> 04:36.818
And, Ronnie,

04:37.151 --> 04:39.237
my dad can't know where I am.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.906
Or that you saw me.
I don't want him wrapped up in this.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.117
-I feel bad enough you're involved.
-Hey.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.746
This was the only way
to get you out of that mess.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.501
Ronnie, I took that plea deal...

04:54.627 --> 04:58.047
because I was tired of putting my friends
and my family through hell.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.008
All the people who have helped you...

05:01.342 --> 05:03.261
are doing it because we love you.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.763
So, I need you to trust me

05:06.472 --> 05:07.473
to handle this.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.727
And stay put.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.028
<i>Archie is a murderer.</i>

05:20.111 --> 05:22.780
And we know he didn't escape alone.
He had help.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.783
Hiding a convict
or withholding information from the law

05:25.867 --> 05:27.327
is a felony offense.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.954
So, whoever's aided
and abetted Archie Andrews

05:30.038 --> 05:32.457
is just as much of a criminal as he is.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.167
I was busy all day, sheriff.

05:34.250 --> 05:38.296
You can check my browser history,
if you know what I mean.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.553
I don't know this Archie person.

05:45.636 --> 05:48.014
And on Mondays,
I host a group for teen Farmies.

05:48.097 --> 05:49.932
We are still accepting members.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.063
Where were you, Ms. McCoy,
at the time of the breakout?

05:56.689 --> 05:58.691
Don't look at me, sir. I, uh...

05:59.859 --> 06:00.693
I...

06:03.196 --> 06:05.406
I was in the music room.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.284
-Practicing.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.288
I'll look into all of your alibis.

06:12.372 --> 06:16.417
And if I find out later
that someone in here was involved,

06:17.001 --> 06:19.087
well, you can say goodbye to this school,

06:19.754 --> 06:22.048
your hopes and dreams.

06:22.131 --> 06:26.511
Your music, your entire future.
All of it goes away, just like that.

06:26.594 --> 06:30.181
Again, to be clear, if you know anything,
now's the time to tell me--

06:30.264 --> 06:31.307
Sheriff Minetta, back off!

06:40.400 --> 06:42.318
What just happened?
Is she okay?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.947
<i>Another seizure?</i>
<i>As if things weren't crazy enough.</i>

06:46.030 --> 06:49.117
I know. First me, then Ethel, then Josie?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.743
What's the connection there?

06:51.285 --> 06:53.704
Speaking of connections,
with Warden Norton dead,

06:53.788 --> 06:55.790
there goes our theory
of him as the Gargoyle King.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.254
Maybe not.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.424
Look.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.678
There's the connection between our parents
and Warden Norton.

07:09.137 --> 07:12.098
Warden Norton was the RROTC instructor
of Riverdale High?

07:12.181 --> 07:14.684
Yeah, the same year
our parents started the Midnight Club.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.352
This proves once more

07:16.436 --> 07:19.021
that our parents continue
to hide things from us.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.441
And it all started
with the Midnight Club, Jug.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.360
Featherhead was
the first blue-lipped death on record.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.822
Somehow I need to get our parents
to talk to us.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.074
Force them into telling us the truth.

07:30.158 --> 07:33.411
-Even if that backs them into a corner.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.831
Depends whether or not
I can borrow Veronica's speakeasy.

07:36.914 --> 07:40.293
Okay, while you're working on that,
I'm going to rally the Serpents.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.337
We have to find Joaquin.
As Norton's accomplice,

07:43.421 --> 07:46.549
he's our best shot to figure out
what was going on inside Norton's mind.

07:50.052 --> 07:50.887
Bye.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.770
Minetta's trashing tent city,
Jug, looking for Archie.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.525
I propose a manhunt of our own.
Every Serpent searching for Joaquin.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.943
No stone left unturned.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.030
Serpents don't just shiv other Serpents.
What got into him?

08:09.113 --> 08:11.616
According to Archie,
Joaquin did it for Warden Norton.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.619
The warden confronted Betty,
called Archie the Red Paladin.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.997
Plus the warden poisoned himself
with cyanide and blueberry Fresh-Aid.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.791
And he worked for Riverdale High
before the detention center.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.462
The question is, was he playing G&amp;G
with someone or for someone?

08:24.545 --> 08:27.548
And since he's dead,
Joaquin's the only one who can know.

08:27.632 --> 08:31.302
But Joaquin may not be alone.
Kevin said he's rolling with a new gang.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.429
-Exactly.

08:34.472 --> 08:39.018
And if the gang is working for the King,
then they're gonna take us right to him.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.022
Archie, you haven't eaten your burger.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.609
To be honest,
I'm not feeling so hot right now, Kev.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.655
Let me see your, uh, bandage.

08:57.787 --> 08:58.621
Okay.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.290
That is definitely infected.

09:02.124 --> 09:04.377
-Great.
-No worries, Arch.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.130
Betty's got a connection.
She'll know what to do.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.383
<i>It's okay, Kevin. He's a doctor.</i>

09:10.758 --> 09:11.884
We can trust him.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.763
Oh, and bring small bills.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.031
Elizabeth.
Don't tell me this is your doing.

09:38.953 --> 09:42.081
I sent the invitations
from the Gargoyle King.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.335
-And look, you all came.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.420
What are you up to?

09:47.503 --> 09:50.881
All of the secrets end now, Mom.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.718
And this was the only way
to get all of you together.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.970
Someone in this room is a murderer.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.776
Alice, we promised each other
we would never talk about this.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.904
-I told Betty to protect her,

10:13.988 --> 10:16.824
-so she wouldn't play the game.
-And it worked. I'm not playing the game.

10:16.907 --> 10:20.119
But many of your kids are.
This is about protecting them.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.495
Care?

10:21.579 --> 10:25.082
Josie had a seizure this morning.
I should be with her right now.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.127
Not here, rehashing the past,
when it has zero relevance.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.671
Attorney McCoy, it is relevant.

10:30.755 --> 10:34.634
Your daughter is playing the game,
along with Kevin and Cheryl.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.260
Even your son Reggie, Mr. Mantle,

10:36.344 --> 10:38.220
no matter
how many black eyes you give him.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.848
I would never hit my son.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.308
Another lie.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.727
Guys, it was bound to get out sometime.

10:44.810 --> 10:48.022
Our children need to know the truth.
Betty, where do we start?

10:48.105 --> 10:50.691
With the dead warden from Archie's juvie.

10:50.775 --> 10:54.862
He was also the RROTC instructor
when you guys were in high school.

10:54.945 --> 10:58.157
Mr. Keller, you were a cadet then.
Did you play the game with him?

10:58.240 --> 11:01.911
Major Norton just confiscated
a stray manual. That's all.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.331
Mr. Lodge, you had business dealings

11:05.414 --> 11:07.083
with Warden Norton until he died.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.212
What were they?
And did you know that he was playing G&amp;G?

11:11.295 --> 11:14.423
None of your business, and not a clue.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.467
What about Ascension Night

11:16.550 --> 11:18.010
How can we answer that?

11:18.094 --> 11:21.389
We were all high off our gourds,
hallucinating gargoyles.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.642
Wait, FP. You saw it, too?

11:25.059 --> 11:27.436
Oh, this is such a waste of our time.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.689
I have a job that I need to get back to.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.107
So, if you'll excuse me...

11:31.399 --> 11:32.400
No, Hiram.

11:34.068 --> 11:37.530
Let's just get this over with.
Otherwise, it will never end.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.202
Betty, you wanna know
who poisoned the chalice.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.289
The Game Master is the one
who sets up the game.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.000
So, my instinct is telling me that...

11:51.335 --> 11:53.003
the culprit was Penelope Blossom.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.966
My guess is maybe she grew the poison
in her greenhouse.

11:57.049 --> 12:00.094
You don't grow cyanide, Hermione.

12:00.177 --> 12:02.304
A fact that only a Blossom would know.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.689
It was Daryl Doiley.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.318
We were both Game Masters.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.821
And he was secretly in love with me.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.117
He put poison in the chalice,

12:23.617 --> 12:25.828
because he wanted us to ascend together.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.457
But I said no.

12:33.335 --> 12:34.378
I assumed...

12:35.796 --> 12:39.759
the chalices were emptied afterwards,
but they were not.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.261
Years later, Daryl came to me,

12:42.344 --> 12:44.847
riddled with guilt
over that tragic incident,

12:45.431 --> 12:46.432
and seeking comfort.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.436
And I refused him again.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.940
We were both married with families, and...

12:56.776 --> 13:02.364
I was afraid, you see,
of revisiting that unholy night.

13:04.658 --> 13:05.659
So, he left. The next day...

13:10.372 --> 13:11.999
he was found dead in his garage.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.796
Sitting in his sedan,
engine running, windows up.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.434
Dilton Doiley's dead dad did it?

13:30.518 --> 13:33.562
That explains how Dilton got his hands
on the game,

13:33.646 --> 13:35.022
and why he started playing.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.943
No, but that doesn't explain
who the Gargoyle King is today.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.945
-Jughead and I saw him.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.948
In Fox Forest.
We've tried to track him down ever since.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.991
Why do you think Jughead started playing?

13:46.075 --> 13:49.370
-I'm afraid so, Mr. Jones.

13:49.453 --> 13:53.499
He's made some really weird connections
between the game and Riverdale,

13:53.582 --> 13:55.918
-which he wouldn't have--
-I've heard enough.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.670
Boy's gonna be the death of me.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.807
Satisfied, Elizabeth?

14:09.890 --> 14:10.891
No, Mom.

14:12.726 --> 14:13.769
Not even close.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.362
Fangs. Did you find Joaquin?

14:23.445 --> 14:26.949
<i>Centerville Serpents spotted him</i>
<i>at the Last Resort Youth Hostel.</i>

14:27.032 --> 14:28.450
-<i>We're on our way.</i>
-Grab him.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.703
Take him to Fox Forest,
near the footbridge.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.872
-I'll meet you there.
-<i>On it, boss man.</i>

14:33.747 --> 14:36.000
Going somewhere, boy?
-To meet the Serpents.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.835
Yeah? Like hell you are.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.838
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

14:40.921 --> 14:42.965
What I should have done,
the second I saw you playing.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.968
You're addicted. G&amp;G's like a drug.
It got into your blood.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.052
I'm not addicted.

14:48.804 --> 14:49.930
I just need to ascend,

14:50.139 --> 14:53.350
so I can find the Gargoyle King,
and put an end to all this.

14:53.934 --> 14:54.935
You're right.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.855
You sound nothing like an addict.
My mistake.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.568
It's time for you to sober up, boy.
For your own good.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.166
Keep it clean and dry.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.877
As for the infection,

15:20.836 --> 15:23.339
I have some antibiotics in the back room.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.466
That is,

15:26.091 --> 15:28.010
if you have something for me.

15:28.385 --> 15:32.348
Thank you, Dr. Curdle Junior.
Betty said to pay you in small bills.

15:37.227 --> 15:40.189
-We should get back to the bunker.
-I can't go back there.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.650
I'm going to Shadow Lake, to the mines,

15:42.733 --> 15:44.735
to find the guys responsible
for putting me away.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.821
How far do you think you're gonna get,
on foot and alone?

15:47.905 --> 15:49.073
Will you help me, Kev?

15:51.825 --> 15:53.410
Veronica is going to kill me.

16:02.086 --> 16:05.005
<i>Okay, Donny.</i>
<i>Let's try this one more time.</i>

16:09.051 --> 16:10.552
<i>Come on. I don't have all day.</i>

16:13.722 --> 16:14.723
What the hell?

16:20.104 --> 16:22.356
Oh, my God. It's been edited.

16:23.899 --> 16:24.942
Veronica?

16:27.486 --> 16:28.696
Are those Archie's case files?

16:30.823 --> 16:33.867
He's not going to be
behind bars ever again, Daddy.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.286
That's a promise.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.718
There are too many variables
up at Shadow Lake.

16:51.885 --> 16:52.886
Take care of them. All of them.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.559
Jug?

16:58.976 --> 17:00.269
Betty.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.984
You don't have a trusty bobby pin, do you?

17:07.568 --> 17:08.402
Always.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.446
Did your dad do this?

17:10.529 --> 17:12.656
Yeah. He doesn't like me playing G&amp;G. That's my fault. I'm sorry.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.327
It came out when I talked
to all of our parents.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.329
How'd that sit

17:19.413 --> 17:23.333
Penelope Blossom said Daryl Doiley
is the one who poisoned the chalices.

17:26.879 --> 17:27.880
Dilton's dad?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.090
Yeah.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.508
Pretty convenient, right?

17:31.759 --> 17:34.970
The one man who can't confirm
or deny Penelope's story.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.930
-I don't buy that.
-Neither do I, Jug.

17:37.097 --> 17:41.101
I called Dr. Curdle Junior and asked
if he'd pull Mr. Doiley's autopsy report.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.936
Think you can handle this yourself?

17:43.020 --> 17:46.732
-Sweet Pea and Fangs maybe found Joaquin.
-Just be careful, Jug.

17:47.983 --> 17:50.819
I know we're getting close
to something, Betty.

18:05.584 --> 18:06.877
Hey, Veronica. What's up?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.713
Seriously, Kevin? You had one job to do.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.049
Put Archie on right the hell now.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.013
Don't blame Kev. It was all me.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.307
<i>If you tell me you're going</i>
<i>to Shadow Mines--</i>

18:20.390 --> 18:23.352
-I am. It's my one shot to clear my name.
-<i>But it's not.</i>

18:23.435 --> 18:24.686
I found something.

18:25.437 --> 18:30.150
Ten minutes of Minetta's interrogation
of the Shadow Lake boys was deleted.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.902
I just have to find the missing footage.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.862
-<i>No.</i>

18:33.946 --> 18:37.157
My dad hangs on to dirt
in case he needs to lord it over someone.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.534
Think it's in his study?

18:38.617 --> 18:40.828
Something as radioactive as this?

18:41.954 --> 18:44.039
He'd keep it far away from himself.

18:45.124 --> 18:49.378
Closer to, let's say, the Mayor's Office.

18:49.461 --> 18:52.047
It's worth a look,
but it won't change my plans.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.423
Fine.

18:54.174 --> 18:57.010
Tell Kevin if he doesn't
get you back to me in one piece,

18:57.094 --> 18:58.637
<i>I will eviscerate him.</i>

19:14.278 --> 19:17.156
So, what's the plan?
I mean, what if these guys are armed?

19:18.073 --> 19:20.200
And you're a sneeze away
from tearing those stitches.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.285
Kevin, I'm fine.

19:21.869 --> 19:22.828
Shh.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.538
Tango-ten-Charlie...

19:49.521 --> 19:50.689
Always my birthday.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.279
Holy crap. Please, be it.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.413
<i>Okay, Donny.</i>
<i>Let's try this one more time.</i>

20:07.122 --> 20:08.123
<i>Ten thousand apiece.</i>

20:08.916 --> 20:13.045
<i>You just say that you saw Archie Andrews</i>
<i>kill your friend Cassidy Bullock.</i>

20:13.128 --> 20:15.797
If that's not proof of coercion,
I don't know what is.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.767
Come on, Internet.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.644
Come on.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.105
She's in here.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.399
-Come on.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.906
I'm the mayor's daughter. I can be here.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.824
False. Her mother and father told me

20:42.908 --> 20:45.619
to call the Sheriff's Department
if she broke in again.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.957
Okay. That's not necessary.

20:52.000 --> 20:52.960
Get up.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.044
Get up!

20:54.127 --> 20:55.462
Look what we found on him.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.765
So, you jumped ship for the gargoyle gang?

21:07.683 --> 21:09.434
You have a lot of explaining to do.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.398
Why not start with why you shivved Archie,

21:14.481 --> 21:16.525
instead of protecting him,
like you were supposed to?

21:17.651 --> 21:19.903
The warden said I had no other choice.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.822
You don't know what it's like there.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.282
You do anything to survive.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.369
For me, it was being the warden's pawn.
A chess piece.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.914
-In some ways, he was a pawn, too.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.959
I saw him with these game cards
that told him what to do.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.795
Whoever sent them wanted Archie dead.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.965
From the moment he was locked up,
he was already marked.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.760
Marked with what?

21:45.387 --> 21:46.388
This symbol...

21:47.347 --> 21:49.349
the warden branded on Archie's hip?

21:49.725 --> 21:50.642
What does it mean?

21:51.184 --> 21:52.019
No, no.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.148
-Pick him up.
-No, no, no.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.526
Just-- Hey, just-- Just stop. Just stop.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.569
Okay.

22:03.905 --> 22:04.740
Sacrifice.

22:05.866 --> 22:06.867
It means that--

22:07.993 --> 22:09.619
It meant that Archie had to die.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.498
Look, I'm sorry, Jug.
I know he was your pal. I--

22:13.582 --> 22:14.708
Oh, Archie's alive.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.419
He won't be for much longer.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.046
Who's giving Warden Norton his orders?

22:19.546 --> 22:21.715
-No.
-Okay.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.176
-I don't think you understand.
-No.

22:24.259 --> 22:26.553
I can't let you go until you talk.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.519
I saw them meet once.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.064
But you know him, Jones.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.482
The man in the black suit.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.568
<i>An ancient evil long forgotten has awoken.</i>

22:41.651 --> 22:44.529
The embodiment of pure malice and cruelty.

22:46.907 --> 22:47.908
It finally happened.

22:48.825 --> 22:49.993
You've lost your mind.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.746
You met Warden Norton in high school.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.415
All this time,
you've sent him quest cards,

22:55.499 --> 22:58.418
instructing him how to torture
and then kill Archie.

22:58.502 --> 23:04.549
You're not just the criminal kingpin
of Riverdale. You're the Gargoyle King.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.426
-The Gargoyle King.

23:07.552 --> 23:10.806
The Ghoulies and this new gang
of gargoyles are your soldiers.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.016
The Southside is your kingdom.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.520
You orchestrated Archie's arrest
to put him under Norton's sadistic thumb.

23:16.603 --> 23:19.147
The game is how
you've been communicating with him,

23:19.231 --> 23:20.273
pulling the strings.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.776
Back in the day,
you killed Principal Featherhead

23:22.859 --> 23:24.319
in the same way you tried to kill me,

23:24.403 --> 23:26.279
and in the same way you tried
to kill Archie.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.323
You're the Gargoyle King, Hiram.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.537
I am not a 16-year-old nerd playing games

23:33.620 --> 23:36.957
to live out
my overactive hormonal fantasies.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.876
I'm not the Gargoyle King.
Because you know what?

23:40.544 --> 23:41.753
That's not a real thing.

23:42.212 --> 23:45.841
Nor am I the murderer that you
and Betty Cooper are looking for.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.885
But if homicidal parents
are what you're after,

23:48.969 --> 23:51.388
may I suggest Clifford Blossom...

23:52.347 --> 23:54.558
Hal Cooper, Tom Keller.

23:56.476 --> 23:57.519
And perhaps...

23:58.687 --> 23:59.813
even your own father.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.857
They all make solid suspects.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.321
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to take this.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.868
You'll see yourself out, won't you?

24:19.207 --> 24:20.333
This is Lodge.

24:22.419 --> 24:23.420
She did what?

24:29.843 --> 24:33.555
What exactly were you hoping to find
in your mother's office, Veronica?

24:33.972 --> 24:37.100
Does Mom even know
what you've been hiding on her desktop?

24:37.184 --> 24:39.019
She doesn't have a computer anymore. I've requested to speak to a lawyer.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.319
It's my right as an American citizen.

24:49.321 --> 24:53.825
So, get your lapdog, Sheriff Minetta,
to bring me to the phone.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.243
Minetta. Hmm.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.913
He's otherwise engaged.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.124
But let me see what I can do.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.295
<i>Yeah, Veronica, is everything okay?</i>

25:05.795 --> 25:07.172
Have you heard from Archie?

25:07.255 --> 25:10.008
He asked me not to tell you,
Mr. Andrews, but...

25:10.884 --> 25:13.345
Archie's headed for the mines
by Shadow Lake with Kevin

25:13.428 --> 25:15.347
<i>to look for the guys</i>
<i>who testified against him.</i>

25:16.223 --> 25:19.184
My intuition tells me
Sheriff Minetta may be doing the same.

25:19.976 --> 25:23.146
-Okay. Uh, I'm on the way.
-<i>Wait.</i>

25:23.230 --> 25:25.065
Tell Archie
I found what I was looking for.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.566
I just have to get it to the judge.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.276
-Veronica, I--
-<i>And on that note,</i>

25:28.360 --> 25:30.737
would you mind
calling Attorney McCoy for me?

25:36.701 --> 25:37.661
<i>I'm confused.</i>

25:37.744 --> 25:41.498
Why is there no mention
of carbon monoxide in Mr. Doiley's file?

25:41.581 --> 25:44.042
Because it was not
the cause of death, Ms. Cooper.

25:44.459 --> 25:48.213
Daryl Doiley was indeed found
in a running car with the windows up,

25:48.296 --> 25:51.007
but there was no trace
of carbon monoxide in his lungs.

25:51.174 --> 25:53.426
That can only mean he was dead beforehand.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.430
Then how did he die, Dr. Curdle Junior?

26:02.060 --> 26:02.894
Oleander.

26:02.978 --> 26:06.856
If ingested, it's one of the most
poisonous plants known to mankind.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.483
In my opinion, Ms. Cooper,

26:08.567 --> 26:12.153
Daryl Doiley's death was a murder,
disguised as a suicide.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.197
Can that be proven with this file?

26:14.281 --> 26:15.824
Unfortunately, no.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.286
This is from my father's
personal collection.

26:19.369 --> 26:22.455
Fine. Then I'll just have
to question whoever closed the case.

26:23.206 --> 26:24.040
Doctor...

26:25.041 --> 26:28.044
who was the sheriff
at the time of Mr. Doiley's death?

26:28.962 --> 26:30.839
Thank you for meeting me, Mr. Keller.

26:30.922 --> 26:31.840
Sure.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.592
Mr. Doiley's death was classified

26:33.675 --> 26:37.137
as suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning,
by your department.

26:37.554 --> 26:41.182
Yet oddly enough there wasn't
a trace of it found in his lungs.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.643
What is this, Betty?
Is this another ambush?

26:43.727 --> 26:45.270
Because I didn't kill anybody.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.731
Maybe not,
but you're complicit in a cover-up.

26:49.065 --> 26:50.483
Who were you protecting?

26:56.197 --> 26:57.198
All of us.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.243
Your mother included.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.996
Someone murdered Daryl Doiley.

27:03.079 --> 27:07.208
Whoever was pulling the strings back then
may be the one killing people today.

27:08.335 --> 27:11.421
The truth is it could've
been any member of the Midnight Club.

27:12.714 --> 27:17.385
But only one of us grows oleander
in their greenhouse.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.471
Now, I know this because I saw it

27:19.554 --> 27:22.223
when I was investigating
Jason Blossom's murder.

27:26.061 --> 27:26.895
Yeah, Fred. What?

27:28.813 --> 27:31.566
Son of a gun. All right, all right.
I'll be right there.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.942
-Mr. Keller--
-I gotta go.

27:58.051 --> 27:58.885
Come on.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.519
Let's keep going.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.993
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, no. It's the Shadow Lake crew.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.787
And Sheriff Minetta was just here.

28:31.084 --> 28:31.918
Hey, hey.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.381
He's still alive.
We gotta get him to a hospital.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.717
-Archie--
-Minetta shot them because of me.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.970
I can't have any more blood on my hands.
Now grab his legs.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.314
Someone's sending us
a message, Jones.

28:54.023 --> 28:55.483
-Come on.

29:15.378 --> 29:16.212
Joaquin.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.888
Who do you think did it?

29:27.390 --> 29:28.391
Uh...

29:30.310 --> 29:31.144
I don't know.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.608
The Gargoyle Gang, or Hiram Lodge.
It could be anyone.

29:38.359 --> 29:39.903
That symbol on his forehead.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.447
Sacrifice.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.660
I have to get to Archie.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.172
We're too late.

29:59.547 --> 30:03.009
Well, for all we know,
Archie and Kevin never made it here, Fred.

30:04.302 --> 30:07.263
Yeah, this is Tom Keller.
I'd like to report a multiple 187.

30:08.264 --> 30:10.475
Two young men, Shadow Lake Mine.

30:11.434 --> 30:12.268
Gunshots.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.401
Police were called
to Shadow Lake Hospital.

30:20.485 --> 30:23.112
A boy was brought in.
Critical condition with gunshot wounds.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.365
-They can't tell me.

30:25.448 --> 30:26.908
No ID. Come on. We should go.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.339
I just heard from the nurse.

30:42.131 --> 30:45.093
He didn't make it, Archie.
They said he lost too much blood.

30:46.302 --> 30:47.303
I'm sorry, man. Everywhere I go...

30:51.099 --> 30:53.560
everything I do just leads to more death.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.228
More pain.

30:55.311 --> 30:57.897
Those guys would still be alive
if I wasn't in the picture.

30:57.981 --> 31:00.316
Let me remind you,
those guys weren't innocent. Okay? They were-- They were criminals.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.571
They didn't deserve to die for it.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.616
Hiram Lodge has done everything
in his power to destroy me.

31:10.159 --> 31:12.287
And he won't stop until I'm dead, too.

31:13.037 --> 31:16.416
Even if by some-- Some miracle,

31:17.333 --> 31:18.710
my innocence is proven...

31:20.378 --> 31:22.463
I don't think I can go back to Riverdale.

31:30.263 --> 31:33.224
Attorney McCoy,
thank you for posting my bail.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.893
How's Josie doing?

31:34.976 --> 31:37.604
She's resting.
And what about you, Veronica?

31:37.687 --> 31:38.688
You tell me.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.525
If one has concrete proof of coercion

31:42.901 --> 31:44.235
and tampering of evidence,

31:45.069 --> 31:47.530
would it be enough
to free the wrongfully accused?

31:50.575 --> 31:51.784
<i>Mrs. Blossom.</i>

31:51.868 --> 31:53.870
Please, Betty. Call me Aunty.

31:55.747 --> 31:56.706
Aunty Blossom...

31:58.166 --> 32:01.294
Mr. Doiley died from oleander poisoning.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.715
Do you have that flower
in your greenhouse?

32:15.767 --> 32:19.854
Even if I wanted to poison Daryl Doiley...

32:21.397 --> 32:24.150
I wouldn't use oleander. It leaves traces.

32:26.819 --> 32:31.366
You know, Betty, I came here to help you,
out of the kindness of my heart.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.035
But if you're looking for someone
to accuse,

32:34.118 --> 32:35.244
it was your own mother

32:35.328 --> 32:37.747
who wrote the article
reporting Daryl's suicide.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.334
So, maybe you should ask yourself,
and her,

32:41.960 --> 32:44.462
what reasons she had
for covering up a murder.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.887
Well, do you have anything
to say for yourself, Mom?

32:54.013 --> 32:58.935
You have shaken every tree today.
I'm sure there's nothing left to say.

32:59.018 --> 33:02.021
How about that you helped
cover up Daryl Doiley's murder?

33:02.105 --> 33:04.065
Oh, Betty. When will you stop?

33:04.148 --> 33:06.359
When you stop lying to me, Mom.

33:06.442 --> 33:09.529
Mr. Doiley didn't die
from carbon monoxide inhalation,

33:09.612 --> 33:11.614
like you wrote in this article.

33:11.698 --> 33:13.992
Someone staged it to look like a suicide.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.995
Someone afraid
of what Mr. Doiley might say.

33:17.078 --> 33:20.081
Thanks to Sheriff Keller,
there was no murder investigation.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.958
You all have a hand in this.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.836
You're all just circling the wagons,
playing a part.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.379
Why, Mom?

33:27.088 --> 33:28.339
Who are you protecting?

33:32.969 --> 33:34.470
-Stay here.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.973
-I'll check the circuit breaker.
-No, I'm coming.

33:42.687 --> 33:43.688
Who is it

33:47.567 --> 33:48.401
Mom. Hello?

33:53.906 --> 33:54.991
Betty, call 911.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.385
Oh, my God.

34:16.512 --> 34:17.555
They were in here.

34:23.269 --> 34:24.353
Get behind me, Betty.

34:25.980 --> 34:26.981
Come on.

34:29.567 --> 34:33.529
Whoa, whoa. I was looking for Jughead,
but someone slammed the door in my face.

34:33.613 --> 34:36.783
-I was trying to get in.
-FP, the Gargoyle King is in the house.

34:36.866 --> 34:37.950
He's in the house.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.243
Shh.

34:40.661 --> 34:41.496
It's okay.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.247
It's okay.

34:52.673 --> 34:53.508
Excuse me.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.594
-A boy was brought here. He was shot.
Dad?

34:56.677 --> 34:57.512
Hey.

34:58.846 --> 35:00.473
-Yeah. I'm fine.

35:02.391 --> 35:04.393
Um, where's Archie

35:04.477 --> 35:07.355
He's okay, Mr. Andrews, but he's gone.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.566
He, uh-- He left you something. A note.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.292
Someone let you out of your cage, I see.

35:29.627 --> 35:30.837
What do you mean, Hiram?

35:31.170 --> 35:32.547
You didn't know, Mom?

35:33.631 --> 35:35.883
Your husband left me in a jail cell,

35:35.967 --> 35:37.885
for putting my nose
where it didn't belong.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.929
But it was so worth it.

35:40.012 --> 35:42.765
-Archie, of course.

35:43.432 --> 35:46.978
I found the deleted tape
of Sheriff Minetta coercing witnesses.

35:47.061 --> 35:50.648
Attorney McCoy's meeting with the judge
to overturn Archie's conviction.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.400
Your henchman, Minetta...

35:54.360 --> 35:56.279
is going down.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.031
And if you two evildoers go down with him,

36:01.033 --> 36:01.868
so be it.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.747
<i>We're no longer safe, Betty.</i>

36:06.831 --> 36:09.834
And that attack was only the beginning.

36:10.751 --> 36:13.379
It's clear that you won't
drop this investigation,

36:13.462 --> 36:15.006
no matter the consequences.

36:15.381 --> 36:17.300
And this house is no longer safe.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.177
Which is why...

36:21.137 --> 36:22.263
I'm going to the Farm,

36:23.389 --> 36:25.850
with Polly and the twins.

36:25.933 --> 36:26.934
Well, have fun.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.937
Because I'm definitely not going
to the Farm.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.939
No. You're not.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.277
Edgar said that you would resist.

36:37.028 --> 36:40.656
-And that we should send you elsewhere.
What's happening?

36:40.740 --> 36:43.743
Betty, there's no safer place for you now.

36:43.826 --> 36:46.537
The Sisters protected me.
They protected Polly.

36:46.621 --> 36:47.830
They'll watch over you. No. Mom.

36:50.541 --> 36:51.375
Mom.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.045
Are you out of your mind?
Why are you doing this?

36:54.128 --> 36:56.088
Because I love you, Elizabeth.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.423
Hey. Mom.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.550
Let me go. Mom.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.810
What do you mean, "he's gone," Kevin?

37:09.894 --> 37:12.688
Believe me, I tried.
Archie said he couldn't come back.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.857
Only because he doesn't know
he's been exonerated.

37:14.941 --> 37:17.777
-Not-- Not alone.

37:17.860 --> 37:18.736
He called--

37:27.703 --> 37:28.537
Veronica.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.582
I am so glad you called, Archie.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.543
We did it. Attorney McCoy worked it out
with the judge.

37:34.627 --> 37:38.005
-<i>You're a free man.</i>
-I shouldn't be surprised. You're amazing.

37:38.089 --> 37:41.884
-I promised you'd be free by homecoming.
-<i>Veronica Lodge keeps her word.</i>

37:41.968 --> 37:43.094
Thank you, Veronica.

37:44.387 --> 37:46.097
For everything you've done for me.

37:46.472 --> 37:47.848
No need to thank me, lover.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.351
Just tell me where to pick you up.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.110
Ronnie, I...

38:01.946 --> 38:03.197
I can't come home.

38:05.408 --> 38:06.492
Didn't you hear me?

38:08.786 --> 38:10.663
There's nothing to be afraid of.

38:10.746 --> 38:14.250
Sheriff Minetta's going to prison
for a long, long time.

38:14.333 --> 38:15.960
But your dad is still out there.

38:17.169 --> 38:18.629
And I can't escape him.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.506
As long as we're together,
he'll hunt me down.

38:20.589 --> 38:23.301
Everyone close to me is his target.
That includes you.

38:23.384 --> 38:24.385
Where are you?

38:25.469 --> 38:28.723
I'm not letting you go off,
God knows where, and alone.

38:30.599 --> 38:31.600
I'm not alone.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.818
Ronnie, when I first met you...

38:42.987 --> 38:43.946
you were it for me.

38:45.906 --> 38:47.616
Everything I could've ever wanted.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.745
I saw our whole future.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.581
Because we're endgame, Archie.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.586
I hope you know how much I love you.

38:59.670 --> 39:02.715
If you loved me, you would come home.

39:03.883 --> 39:06.052
You know in your heart
I'm right about this.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.303
It just hurts to admit it.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.308
Don't make me say goodbye to you,
Archie Andrews.

39:12.808 --> 39:14.560
<i>Because I don't wanna hear it back.</i>

39:18.105 --> 39:18.939
I can't.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.151
I can't. I...

39:40.878 --> 39:41.962
Goodbye, Veronica.

39:54.850 --> 39:55.851
Some money.

39:56.310 --> 39:57.520
A change of clothes.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.940
Granola bars, juice boxes. Thanks for coming out here, Jug.

40:07.279 --> 40:08.697
Sure you wanna do this, man?

40:10.116 --> 40:11.700
Leaving is my best option, Jug.

40:12.910 --> 40:13.911
It's my only option. I don't disagree.

40:24.880 --> 40:25.881
Joaquin is dead.

40:27.633 --> 40:30.845
That symbol you have branded on your hip,
he had one on his forehead.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.514
It means "sacrifice."

40:34.056 --> 40:34.890
What?

40:36.142 --> 40:38.269
-I don't know.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.064
I have a feeling
Hiram Lodge is a part of it.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.066
He always is.

40:45.734 --> 40:47.945
Don't worry.
I won't let you out of my sight.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.115
You ever hop a train before?

40:52.116 --> 40:52.950
No.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.161
<i>♪ Paladin ♪</i>

40:55.244 --> 40:56.245
We'll figure it out.

40:58.497 --> 41:03.752
<i>♪ Paladin, Paladin, where do you roam? ♪</i>

41:05.254 --> 41:11.260
<i>♪ Paladin, Paladin, far, far from home ♪</i>

41:13.804 --> 41:17.808
I know you've looked down on our practices
in the past, Ms. Cooper.

41:17.892 --> 41:21.187
But I want to assure you
that we're going to make you well.

41:33.657 --> 41:36.076
You're safe
with the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.
