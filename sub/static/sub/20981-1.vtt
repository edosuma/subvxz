00:24.491 --> 00:28.791
<i>And it was announced today that another</i>
<i>fifteen thousand National Guard troops</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:32.729
<i>would be called to active duty</i>
<i>and deployed to Iraq within the month.</i>

00:32.799 --> 00:35.529
<i>President George Bush</i>
<i>is urging all Americans</i>

00:35.602 --> 00:37.900
<i>to stand united on the war in Iraq.</i>

00:37.971 --> 00:40.269
<i>And the Bush administration is facing</i>
<i>some difficult decisions</i>

00:40.340 --> 00:42.570
<i>on troop levels for the war in Iraq.</i>

00:50.583 --> 00:54.542
<i>No, you are not bothering us.</i>
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>

00:54.621 --> 00:57.351
<i>- How is it going?</i>
- Not good.

00:58.358 --> 01:01.293
<i>Oh I do wish we were</i>
<i>there to help you out, hon.</i>

01:08.001 --> 01:10.094
<i>I saw on the news last night</i>
<i>that they are extending</i>

01:10.170 --> 01:12.900
<i>all the National Guard people over there.</i>

01:13.039 --> 01:15.530
<i>- Will Noah be extended?</i>
- October.

01:15.608 --> 01:20.841
<i>Oh, I can't believe it.</i>
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

01:21.481 --> 01:24.348
Well, we can't afford day care.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.442
But if I don't go back to work
in the next six weeks,

01:26.519 --> 01:29.579
we're going to lose
the kids' health insurance.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.556
All right you guys, cut it out now. Stop it.

01:31.624 --> 01:35.424
<i>I would offer to come out there and help.</i>
<i>But with Ed's condition I...</i>

01:35.495 --> 01:39.522
- No, I know.
- Mommy.

01:39.599 --> 01:43.968
<i>- Maybe your parents.</i>
- No.

01:44.037 --> 01:47.939
<i>- Well, what about Salman?</i>
- Salman?

01:50.343 --> 01:52.971
- What about him?
<i>- Maybe Salman could come out</i>

01:53.046 --> 01:56.607
<i>and help you for a while. I'm sure the boys</i>
<i>would love to meet their uncle.</i>

01:56.683 --> 01:59.846
I don't know. I mean, where is he now?

01:59.919 --> 02:02.513
<i>He is in Nevada.</i>

02:03.590 --> 02:04.579
What is he doing?

02:05.525 --> 02:07.152
Help! Help!

02:12.499 --> 02:14.797
Is he working?

02:14.868 --> 02:19.999
<i>No. He was fired again.</i>
<i>I just heard from him on Mother's Day.</i>

02:20.073 --> 02:22.303
- Yeah. What was he fired for?
<i>- Oh...</i>

02:24.511 --> 02:28.470
Okay. When you see the red light
that means it is hot enough to laminate.

02:28.548 --> 02:31.312
You just slide everything through here.

02:31.384 --> 02:32.942
And you have to pull it through
on the other side.

02:33.019 --> 02:36.318
Jesus Christ, can I just get one color copy?

02:38.525 --> 02:40.425
Here, I'll be right back.

03:16.396 --> 03:19.058
- I didn't want this laminated.
- Why not?

03:19.399 --> 03:20.730
This is my resume.

03:35.415 --> 03:38.350
- I don't know.
<i>- I'll call him right now.</i>

03:38.418 --> 03:40.716
<i>I have a number.</i>
<i>I think he is living with some friends.</i>

03:45.325 --> 03:49.921
<i>Now, Les, I don't want you to worry.</i>
<i>Everything is going to work out.</i>

03:49.996 --> 03:53.932
<i>Noah will be home in one piece</i>
<i>before you know it, God willing.</i>

03:54.000 --> 03:55.968
<i>I'll call Salman and leave him a message.</i>

03:56.035 --> 04:01.268
<i>It will all work itself out.</i>
<i>And it will all be okay. Okay?</i>

04:03.076 --> 04:06.637
<i>The Bush administration sends its top guns</i>
<i>from the Pentagon to Capitol Hill</i>

04:06.713 --> 04:08.977
<i>in an effort to reassure all Americans.</i>

04:09.048 --> 04:12.950
<i>A more emotional debate yesterday in the</i>
<i>House of Representatives on the war in Iraq.</i>

04:13.019 --> 04:15.180
<i>It ended, as expected,</i>

04:15.255 --> 04:18.690
<i>with passage of</i>
<i>a Republican draft resolution that...</i>

04:18.757 --> 04:22.751
<i>President Bush got a briefing</i>
<i>at the Pentagon today. And afterwards...</i>

04:40.480 --> 04:42.812
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

04:42.882 --> 04:45.146
- Come in.
- Hi.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.778
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:52.258 --> 04:55.955
- Don't you have luggage?
- Oh yeah.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.430
- I have this.
- Yeah, that is luggage.

04:59.499 --> 05:05.961
All my other stuff is in storage.
In Vermont and Dubuque.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.564
- Okay. Whatever.
- Okay.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.735
- That is an interesting belt.
- Oh, thanks.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.575
Yeah, I made it myself. At work.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.638
You know, it is basically a cardboard belt.

05:16.716 --> 05:22.348
But it is made with plastic.
So it is a plastic belt.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.549
- It is cool.
- Thanks.

05:27.860 --> 05:31.227
- So, that is one of them? That is Cameron?
- That is Lincoln.

05:31.297 --> 05:33.731
Oh. Okay.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.496
Hi, Cam. Hi, Lincoln. Hi. Hi, Lincoln.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.794
Hi, Lincoln.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.031
No!

05:40.873 --> 05:43.603
Well, yeah. They are kind of shy.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.337
Dinner!

05:46.179 --> 05:50.138
<i>Many questions today for</i>
<i>Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld...</i>

05:50.216 --> 05:51.945
Cameron, take a bite.

05:52.051 --> 05:55.111
No, I don't want to. I won't eat anything!

06:01.127 --> 06:03.425
This is good, water.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.563
So I guess we haven't seen you
since the wedding.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.268
Oh. Yeah.

06:15.341 --> 06:17.969
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.536
- You ever talk to Noah about that?
- No.

06:21.614 --> 06:26.677
I didn't want to. He was so mad.
I just didn't know if...

06:26.786 --> 06:30.449
The fire department and all.
We didn't talk about it.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.318
Oh.

06:34.394 --> 06:38.330
Yeah.
So I have to go back to work tomorrow.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.423
Oh, tomorrow? Okay. All right.
I thought it was next week.

06:40.500 --> 06:45.233
And I will be gone from 8:00 to 5:00.
But sometimes until 6:00.

06:45.304 --> 06:47.204
And that is when the kids have dinner.

06:47.273 --> 06:50.538
Right.
So I will be feeding them dinner at night.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.908
Making dinner for them. Okay.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.379
- And breakfast, and lunch.
- Oh right. Okay.

06:55.448 --> 06:58.246
- No, of course, I'll do all three.
- All day.

06:58.317 --> 07:01.286
Yeah, I know. It is feeding them. I know.

07:01.354 --> 07:06.917
I'll show you where everything is tonight.
You know, after the kids are in B-E-D.

07:08.194 --> 07:11.686
- In bed?
- No, I don't want to go to bed!

07:11.764 --> 07:14.597
No, mommy!

07:14.667 --> 07:15.759
Sorry.

07:17.003 --> 07:22.964
Yeah, so, this is the spare room.
So I thought you could just stay here.

07:27.580 --> 07:31.573
I didn't bring a bed with me.

07:32.919 --> 07:36.082
- This?
- Yes. The other sleeping bags are wet.

07:36.155 --> 07:39.090
Is that the one with vomit in it?

07:39.158 --> 07:40.625
I can't tell.

07:40.693 --> 07:44.561
And there is a lantern up there.
The light in that room doesn't work.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.894
- So, you should take that.
- This?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.992
No, that is a camp stove.
You can have that if you want it.

07:50.069 --> 07:52.264
I don't think I'll be cooking in there. Will I?

07:52.338 --> 07:56.172
Whatever. It is up to you.
Do you want the tent?

07:59.712 --> 08:01.839
Good night. I love you.

08:05.551 --> 08:08.850
I'm really tired right now.
So I don't feel like going over everything.

08:08.921 --> 08:11.981
Do you think you have it?

08:12.058 --> 08:15.084
- I guess so.
- Can we just talk in the morning then?

08:15.161 --> 08:16.890
Can I leave you a note? I'll leave you a note.

08:16.963 --> 08:20.797
What do I do if something happens
that I have to reach you?

08:21.701 --> 08:25.728
I have a text message, pager thing.
So, just leave me a message.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.572
Okay.

08:28.674 --> 08:32.371
You know what? That thing is really
for work. It is supposed to be for work.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.913
So don't page me. Do not page me.

08:34.981 --> 08:37.813
- Okay.
- And be really quiet

08:37.884 --> 08:39.943
when you are getting ready for bed.
They are right next door.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.681
- Okay.
- Did you use the bathroom yet?

08:44.590 --> 08:47.991
- No.
- Oh, my...

08:48.060 --> 08:52.053
But I can wait until morning, I guess.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.557
That is great. Okay. Thanks. That is good.

08:54.634 --> 08:57.330
- Good night.
- Good night.

09:47.653 --> 09:52.613
- Mommy is leaving!
- Mommy!

09:57.763 --> 09:59.094
Hello?

09:59.165 --> 10:01.429
Mommy! Mommy!

10:01.500 --> 10:05.129
- Guys...
- Mommy!

10:12.678 --> 10:14.305
Mommy!

10:17.249 --> 10:21.345
Mommy, mommy!

10:21.420 --> 10:26.187
Mommy! Mommy!

10:26.258 --> 10:28.317
Mommy!

11:17.510 --> 11:19.239
No more cookies.

11:24.183 --> 11:28.176
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

11:28.254 --> 11:30.085
I'm babysitting.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.262
So, they had cereal for dinner?

11:45.337 --> 11:49.603
No, no, that was just a snack.

11:49.675 --> 11:52.667
- What did they eat for lunch?
- Sandwiches.

11:52.745 --> 11:54.576
And breakfast?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.750
What did you do all day?

12:00.820 --> 12:04.688
Well, we played in their room
for a little while.

12:04.924 --> 12:08.519
Lincoln, we have to put underpants on
if we are going to be in polite society.

12:08.594 --> 12:10.892
I don't want to be hit on the shoulder.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.157
And then I gave them a bath.

12:15.468 --> 12:19.097
Hey kids. Just stay in the bath tub, all right?
I'm almost done!

12:21.006 --> 12:23.770
Cameron? Lincoln?

12:23.843 --> 12:26.903
Where are you?

12:26.979 --> 12:29.106
Lincoln? Cameron?
Lincoln! Wait a minute.

12:29.181 --> 12:30.808
It is okay. You are okay. Come on.

12:30.883 --> 12:33.784
Cameron? Where are you?
You are okay, Lincoln.

12:33.853 --> 12:37.345
- You are okay. Where is Cameron?
- I'm drowned.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.687
You are not drowned.
You are still talking.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.718
No towels. All right, let me get you a towel.
Hold on. Cameron?

12:46.232 --> 12:47.460
Hey!

12:48.467 --> 12:50.094
And then we went for a walk.

12:50.169 --> 12:53.900
Cameron? Cameron, come here!
Come back here, Cameron.

12:53.973 --> 12:57.204
Cameron! Cameron, come here!

13:05.684 --> 13:10.087
And maybe we could go over stuff,
like you said you would leave in that note.

13:10.156 --> 13:13.125
Because the note you left was fine.
Whatever.

13:13.192 --> 13:16.684
But I couldn't really find much food
besides cereal.

13:16.762 --> 13:19.663
Why didn't you just walk
to the grocery store?

13:19.732 --> 13:25.432
Oh. Well I didn't know that I could.
I mean, I will.

13:25.504 --> 13:27.870
I'm not against that.
I just didn't know it was an option.

13:27.940 --> 13:31.398
- What is that?
- It is the mail.

13:31.477 --> 13:35.971
- When did it come?
- Today. It is today's mail.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.073
- This came today?
- Yeah.

13:38.150 --> 13:42.348
This is from Noah. It is a letter from Noah.
Why didn't you page me?

13:42.421 --> 13:45.049
But you said not to page...

13:51.797 --> 13:56.860
Yeah, no. Yeah, of course.
Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Sorry.

14:15.721 --> 14:18.554
Come on, relax.

14:18.624 --> 14:20.319
Let us go!

14:25.297 --> 14:26.628
No, no!

15:01.867 --> 15:03.960
I can't take you both in at once.
I'll come right back.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.664
You are okay. It is okay.
I will be right back.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.798
Calm down, calm down.
Just relax. We will be right back.

15:08.874 --> 15:10.535
Excuse me.

15:10.609 --> 15:13.134
- What are you doing?
- Have you kidnapped these kids?

15:13.212 --> 15:16.978
What? No, no, no.
Their father is my brother.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.279
All right, whatever.
Because I'm just being safe.

15:19.351 --> 15:22.912
You would be surprised how many people
bring juvenile hostages into grocery stores.

15:22.988 --> 15:26.924
And then it is,
"Hello! AMBER alert."

15:26.992 --> 15:31.224
Sir, we can't have you tying your child
up outside the store. It looks very bad.

15:31.297 --> 15:35.825
They are not his kids.
Apparently he is their uncle. Or so he says.

15:35.901 --> 15:39.860
Please, just untie the child.
This is a family store.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.964
Or go over to the Shopway.

15:46.645 --> 15:50.046
Hold this. Cameron! Come back here.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.721
Cameron, Cameron? Cameron?

16:03.429 --> 16:05.454
All right, that is enough. Now let us go.
Now we are going home.

16:05.531 --> 16:11.902
Hey! Hey! What? Stop it. Stop it.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.099
- I hate you!
- Now Cameron, that is enough.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.233
Now let us go. Come on.

16:18.510 --> 16:23.038
I am going to kill you.

16:34.126 --> 16:37.186
- This is not working.
- Yeah. Well, I tried...

16:37.262 --> 16:40.390
Mommy, mommy,look at this
beautiful flower I drew for you.

16:40.599 --> 16:43.534
That is nice Cameron, but I'm talking
to uncle Salman right now. Okay?

16:43.602 --> 16:44.899
I love you, mommy.

16:44.970 --> 16:47.632
I love you too.
I'll look at it later on, all right?

16:56.281 --> 16:59.910
You know, your son there
threatened to kill me today.

16:59.985 --> 17:03.113
- Why would you say something like that?
- Because it is true.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.123
He told me he was going to kill me.
And you know, he had this

17:06.191 --> 17:08.682
incredibly cold look in his eyes.
And for a minute I just didn't know.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.854
Mommy, mommy, I drew you a princess.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.920
This, I mean, this right now.
This, what you're seeing right now?

17:12.998 --> 17:14.965
This is just a spin. This is just a front.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.730
I mean, you don't have any idea what
this kid is like when you are not around.

17:17.803 --> 17:21.603
You know? I mean, he may very well be like
Damien in <i>The Omen!</i> That does happen!

17:21.673 --> 17:24.141
- It is possible.
- Mommy, can I sit next to you at dinner?

17:24.209 --> 17:26.006
Okay. That is enough.

17:26.078 --> 17:30.139
Okay, Cameron, dinner is going
to be ready in a minute, honey.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.782
I think you should
go back to Nevada.

17:40.092 --> 17:42.356
- I can't.
- Why not?

17:43.429 --> 17:47.456
I don't have any money.
I can't afford to go anywhere.

17:49.268 --> 17:53.170
You are thirty-two years old
and you can't afford a bus ticket?

17:53.238 --> 17:54.432
No.

17:56.642 --> 18:00.203
Even if I did, it is not like I can
just get on the bus and go anywhere.

18:00.279 --> 18:03.373
I don't have any money.
I can't get an apartment.

18:03.449 --> 18:07.146
- So you don't have a credit card?
- Yes.

18:07.986 --> 18:11.217
But it's totally...

18:14.359 --> 18:15.587
Yeah.

19:22.394 --> 19:25.295
- Hi, mommy.
- Hi.

19:27.599 --> 19:31.558
- What are you...
- I came home for lunch.

19:33.272 --> 19:37.766
- Okay. We were just about to...
- I may know of a job for you.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.210
Really?

19:44.016 --> 19:46.780
<i>- Is it a full time job?</i>
<i>- I don't know what it is.</i>

19:46.852 --> 19:49.514
<i>It is with maintenance or</i>
<i>something in my building at work.</i>

19:49.588 --> 19:51.988
<i>I just heard they were hiring</i>
<i>and I gave them your name.</i>

19:52.057 --> 19:54.719
<i>- Does maintenance mean like trash pickup?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

19:54.793 --> 19:56.124
<i>Well, what are we going to do</i>
<i>about the boys?</i>

19:56.195 --> 19:59.392
<i>If it is not full time, the boys could</i>
<i>be in day care for a couple of days.</i>

19:59.464 --> 20:03.127
<i>- You can help me pay for that now.</i>
<i>- What is the actual job?</i>

20:03.202 --> 20:07.298
<i>Salman, look just go down there and</i>
<i>talk to them. I gave them your name.</i>

20:07.372 --> 20:09.101
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Yes. Say, "Thank you."</i>

20:09.174 --> 20:10.436
<i>Thank you.</i>

20:10.509 --> 20:12.773
He likes me.
There is nothing I can do about it.

20:12.844 --> 20:16.245
I don't know why I should be in
trouble because he likes me.

20:16.315 --> 20:18.374
So I told her right to her face,
"You can't talk to me like that.

20:18.450 --> 20:21.112
"I have been working for seven years.
And I don't have to take that."

20:21.186 --> 20:23.916
And I don't. And she knows that.

20:23.989 --> 20:26.981
And he smiled, he looked at me and I just...

20:28.093 --> 20:31.927
So I don't care. I didn't say anything.
She didn't say anything.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.589
That is just the kind of person I am.

20:33.665 --> 20:36.532
Is it my fault the other company's CEO
is flirting with me?

20:36.602 --> 20:39.196
Or if he thinks I'm cute or smart?
Or really good with PowerPoint?

20:39.271 --> 20:42.399
No, it is not. She can't even do her own
PowerPoint presentation.

20:42.474 --> 20:45.443
She can't even print her handouts
three to a page on a color printer.

20:45.510 --> 20:49.207
But you know, because she is the manager,
it is okay.

20:49.281 --> 20:52.614
You know, during the meeting he said,
"Who did these slides?"

20:52.684 --> 20:55.380
Because it is the same aqua color
I use on all my graphs.

20:55.454 --> 20:57.354
And I didn't say anything.
Because I never say anything.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.686
You know, do I say anything?
I never say anything.

20:59.758 --> 21:03.956
I just do my work and keep my mouth shut.
And I don't say anything.

21:16.842 --> 21:20.608
- I have a job interview here.
- Job interview?

21:20.679 --> 21:23.773
Nobody is getting hired here.

21:23.849 --> 21:26.977
I think so.
This Blunexion in this building, right?

21:27.052 --> 21:31.648
Yeah, well the whole building is Blunexion.
What is left of them.

21:31.723 --> 21:34.248
- What do you mean, what is left?
- Well, the market crashed

21:34.326 --> 21:36.385
before they could get everybody moved in,
didn't it?

21:36.461 --> 21:39.396
And who is working there now?
Ten people? Eight?

21:39.464 --> 21:44.401
For one little Internet web site.
No. There are no job interviews here.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.369
Shit.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.431
- Are you Trout?
- What?

21:49.508 --> 21:53.000
Trout, the brother of the receptionist, Leslie.
Or whatever.

21:53.078 --> 21:57.447
Oh, yeah, brother-in-law.
But it is Salman, not Trout.

21:57.516 --> 22:01.043
- Salmon?
- Salman. Like Salman Rushdie.

22:01.119 --> 22:03.144
You mean, "Salman Rushdie"?

22:04.289 --> 22:09.989
Jesus. Whatever. Just come with me.
And thank you for your help, Edgar.

22:18.370 --> 22:20.031
Get the door.

22:22.140 --> 22:24.370
Come on. Keep up.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.411
Take a seat.

22:31.917 --> 22:36.115
All right. I am going to be as honest
with you as I can possibly be.

22:37.789 --> 22:41.885
I cannot get you into the 401 K.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.427
Oh, okay.

22:43.495 --> 22:45.827
They are just barely
holding this place together, as it is.

22:45.897 --> 22:49.594
I can't even get a haircut because of
the bullshit I'm tied into down here.

22:49.668 --> 22:51.465
I thought this
was a maintenance position.

22:51.536 --> 22:54.767
Look this is the last favor
I'm doing for you guys upstairs.

22:54.840 --> 22:58.207
Now if Lyle wants to come down here
and screw me over, let him do it to my face.

22:58.276 --> 23:02.178
I am legally required to post this job
in the paper for two weeks.

23:02.247 --> 23:06.343
And accept resumes from minorities
and the mentally handicapped.

23:06.418 --> 23:10.718
Now, I will hire you.
But this is my last favor. The last one.

23:10.789 --> 23:15.453
That's it. You got it?
Oh, Jesus Crap Christ. What now?

23:15.527 --> 23:19.429
What the hell you doing, Kathleen?
Who gave you authorization to do this?

23:19.498 --> 23:23.457
If you must know, Ken told me to
get someone to publicize the rental space.

23:23.535 --> 23:26.026
- How much they paying you, dude?
- I don't know.

23:26.104 --> 23:29.369
I'm just trying to bring some revenue
into the building to keep up

23:29.441 --> 23:33.468
with the projections
that were set without my prior approval!

23:33.545 --> 23:36.844
You know what, Kathleen?
I don't need any of your bullshit right now!

23:36.915 --> 23:38.143
You get off my back!

23:38.216 --> 23:40.616
So help me God,
I am going to roast you, woman.

23:40.685 --> 23:43.848
- Just get out of here!
- Don't let her manipulate you, man!

23:43.922 --> 23:46.584
- Okay.
- Eat my mother-loving shit!

23:46.658 --> 23:50.754
Good one, Kathleen.
Got me on that one, didn't you?

23:56.334 --> 23:59.997
All right. Fuck!

24:00.071 --> 24:02.437
Are you ready to get started?

24:03.341 --> 24:06.606
But what is the job?

24:06.678 --> 24:11.377
All you have to do
is hand out flyers on the street.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.180
It is eight... It is six dollars an hour.

24:14.319 --> 24:17.948
And if you get someone to lease office
space, I will give you a two hundred...

24:18.023 --> 24:21.584
I'll give you a hundred dollar bonus.
All right?

24:21.660 --> 24:24.322
Okay. Now, get up and come here.

24:24.396 --> 24:27.388
I have to work every other day.
And then half day on Friday.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.990
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

24:29.067 --> 24:31.968
We just need to establish a street
presence to get the word out.

24:32.037 --> 24:34.471
- Do you suffocate?
- What?

24:34.539 --> 24:37.474
In small spaces. Do you asphyxiate?

24:37.542 --> 24:42.241
Are you...
Oh, you know, agorerotic or whatever?

24:42.314 --> 24:45.875
- No.
- Good. Okay, just get your feet in here.

24:45.951 --> 24:48.078
The head is really heavy
so we will start with the body.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.520
- Wait. I'm going to wear this?
- Well, I'm sure as hell not going to wear it.

24:51.590 --> 24:55.754
Look, we had a shitload of luck with this
thing at a company picnic a few years back.

24:55.827 --> 24:59.194
It is not like you have to dance around.
You just hand out flyers.

24:59.264 --> 25:02.563
Now get your foot in there, okay? Come on.

25:02.634 --> 25:05.398
- I have to get my other shoe off.
- Well then, let us do it.

25:05.504 --> 25:09.201
- Okay, other foot. That is it.
- Feels kind of weird.

25:09.274 --> 25:13.677
Oh this thing is going to be hot.
You are not a diabetic, are you?

25:23.088 --> 25:25.181
Come on!

25:41.740 --> 25:43.708
Let us go, Kabluey!

25:44.943 --> 25:49.403
Come on, you can do it.
Just follow the sound of my voice.

25:49.481 --> 25:54.418
Listen to me clap. Hear that?
Just follow the clapping.

25:54.486 --> 26:00.152
Let us go. One, two, three, four. Hey.
Whoa, whoa, Nellie, whoa. There we go.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.659
- Where are we going?
- I'm going to take you out front.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.161
You have to be out
where people can see you.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.528
- Okay.
- Now, I'm going to

26:07.599 --> 26:12.161
have to put you in the front of the car.
That suit is not going to fit in the back.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.864
- Is that your dog?
- Yeah, that is my dog.

26:13.939 --> 26:17.431
We will get to know each other on the drive.
Get into the car.

26:17.709 --> 26:19.108
- Okay. You okay?
- Yeah.

26:19.177 --> 26:21.111
All right, here we go.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.273
Don't give any flyers to assholes
who don't look serious.

26:25.350 --> 26:29.753
I don't want to be up all fricking night
Xeroxing a whole big bunch more.

26:29.821 --> 26:31.083
Okay, here we go.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.879
This is good. This is fine.

27:00.151 --> 27:02.711
- Okay, got the door.
- Okay, but...

27:02.787 --> 27:07.850
I have you, come on.
It is real simple.

27:08.927 --> 27:13.796
Here we go. Here we go.
Now, if it is too slow out here today,

27:13.865 --> 27:15.856
- we will move you further out tomorrow.
- But...

27:15.934 --> 27:19.370
Okay. Wait, you don't want to forget these.
No point in being out here

27:19.437 --> 27:22.634
if you don't have these.
Here you go.

27:22.741 --> 27:25.733
- Okay, but...
- Okay.

27:27.412 --> 27:28.845
- Here, just hang on to them.
- I don't have any hands.

27:28.913 --> 27:30.676
Oh, for Christ sake!

27:32.083 --> 27:36.486
There you go. There you go.
Now you are good. You are fine.

27:36.554 --> 27:40.490
Okay. Now if you need me...
Oh shit! My dog is puking.

27:40.558 --> 27:43.652
- Well, if you need me, just call me.
- I don't have a cell phone.

27:43.728 --> 27:45.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:51.036 --> 27:54.767
- You need a ride back at the end of the day?
- Yes.

27:54.839 --> 27:58.036
All right, I'll come back and get you.
Jesus.

28:30.475 --> 28:32.306
Bastards!

28:32.377 --> 28:35.312
You Blunexion assholes!

28:35.380 --> 28:39.248
You steal my practice! You ruined my life!

28:39.918 --> 28:44.582
How could you do this to me?
Give me back my life savings!

28:44.689 --> 28:45.917
Asshole!

29:08.413 --> 29:10.438
Flyer. Flyer.

29:27.332 --> 29:29.732
Hey! Hey! Hey!

29:31.002 --> 29:32.469
Help!

29:41.079 --> 29:42.944
What the hell is that?

29:45.350 --> 29:46.977
What is that?

29:55.226 --> 29:58.354
- What is up buddy, what are you doing?
- I'm working.

29:58.429 --> 30:00.226
Are you guys interested in
renting some office space?

30:00.298 --> 30:03.563
You are renting parts of this field
as office space?

30:03.635 --> 30:06.570
Oh, no. No, no, it is...

30:06.638 --> 30:10.768
It is a building down the road. I mean,
I don't know if you can see it from here.

30:10.842 --> 30:12.810
God damn, this is trippy.

30:12.877 --> 30:16.278
It is back over there, and if you're
interested, that would be great.

30:16.347 --> 30:19.316
Hey, you hot in there, man?
It is like mad hot today.

30:19.384 --> 30:20.851
- Yes.
- You want something to drink?

30:20.919 --> 30:23.114
Oh sure. That would be great.
Thanks.

30:23.188 --> 30:25.622
Jay, give me one of those brews.

30:28.693 --> 30:31.491
- Dude.
- That echoed.

30:31.563 --> 30:33.326
Here, hold out your hands.

30:33.398 --> 30:36.094
Here, hold on. There you go.
Squeeze it, man.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.828
- Can you feel that?
- Yeah.

30:37.902 --> 30:40.735
- Good luck, man.
- Okay.

30:40.805 --> 30:46.038
- Good luck, bro.
- Thanks guys. See you later.

30:46.110 --> 30:50.809
Bye. Thanks for the beer.
I will be here hanging out.

33:36.414 --> 33:39.178
So, how was it?

33:39.250 --> 33:41.480
What are they having you do?

34:40.344 --> 34:42.005
Hey!

34:43.313 --> 34:44.645
What the hell are you doing?

34:46.083 --> 34:48.518
- How do you know it was him?
- How do I know it was him?

34:48.585 --> 34:50.554
Who else would it be?

34:54.891 --> 34:58.089
Oh, and you should have seen today.
He was totally checking me out again.

34:58.162 --> 35:01.495
But he can't make a move, because
data streaming is a very small community.

35:01.566 --> 35:03.932
And everybody would know.
But he was checking me out.

35:04.001 --> 35:08.165
So I just went up to him,
"We should have lunch sometime."

35:08.239 --> 35:11.834
Just like that. Totally casual.
You should have seen him.

35:11.909 --> 35:15.902
Oh, he will call. He will.
I know he will.

35:17.148 --> 35:20.276
He is such a catch.
Oh my God, is that a deer?

35:35.366 --> 35:36.697
So, it's like you live nearby.

35:36.767 --> 35:39.099
And you could, like, get in your car
and drive to the office.

35:39.170 --> 35:42.970
And you have some office space.
And then come in every day.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.545
Office space for rent.

35:58.723 --> 36:00.315
Are you alive?

36:27.185 --> 36:28.777
What do we do?

36:46.037 --> 36:47.061
You are going to be okay.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.127
We can't call your mom.
No, you are okay.

37:25.343 --> 37:28.904
You know, it is not like he can ask
me out even if he totally wants to.

37:28.980 --> 37:32.245
Which he does. Trust me.
You look kind of strange today.

37:32.316 --> 37:36.150
Kind of greenish, are you okay?
Because I don't want to get sick.

37:42.193 --> 37:45.492
Listen, can I ask you a question?

37:45.563 --> 37:49.863
Are you a clown?

37:49.934 --> 37:53.461
What? What do you mean? No.

37:53.537 --> 37:57.064
But do you do children's parties?

37:58.209 --> 38:00.177
I don't know.

38:00.244 --> 38:06.308
Well, as you can see,
I have a bunch of kids who love you.

38:08.085 --> 38:12.715
They will only let me drive them home
on this road just to see you.

38:20.898 --> 38:25.562
Anyway, we are having a party
at our house this weekend.

38:25.636 --> 38:29.868
So, I was wondering
if you are available?

38:29.940 --> 38:32.465
- Yeah. But I don't...
- $50.

38:32.543 --> 38:34.773
- Oh, I mean...
- $75.

38:34.845 --> 38:36.540
It's not that I...
No, you don't have to.

38:36.614 --> 38:42.348
$100. Final offer, okay?
The ponies are ridiculous.

38:42.420 --> 38:45.048
You know what,
let me get you my card.

38:55.199 --> 38:59.135
Actually can you put it in my hand?
My real hand.

38:59.203 --> 39:02.297
Oh, really? Okay.

39:10.548 --> 39:15.281
- Thanks.
- Call me. If you are not interested.

39:15.353 --> 39:19.187
- In fact call me, either way, will you?
- Sure.

39:21.425 --> 39:26.328
- Hey, sorry do you know what time it is?
- 6:27.

39:26.397 --> 39:28.763
Really? Because my ride
was supposed to be here at 5:45.

39:28.833 --> 39:33.463
- Talk to you soon.
- Okay. Bye.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.843
Hello? Hello!

40:19.417 --> 40:21.112
Hello?

40:27.558 --> 40:28.752
Great.

40:31.495 --> 40:32.894
Hello?

42:37.788 --> 42:39.153
- What was that?
- I don't know.

42:48.933 --> 42:50.093
Hello?

43:12.957 --> 43:16.518
<i>Coalition forces there</i>
<i>have recovered two bodies.</i>

43:16.594 --> 43:18.926
<i>We are going now
to APN's Leslie Newton</i>

43:18.996 --> 43:20.793
<i>who has covered
this story in Baghdad.</i>

43:20.864 --> 43:24.527
<i>And Leslie, could you describe</i>
<i>the scale of the search</i>

43:24.602 --> 43:27.093
<i>for these two men</i>
<i>over the last several days?</i>

43:27.171 --> 43:32.473
<i>About eight thousand American forces,</i>
<i>as well as Iraqi security forces</i>

43:32.543 --> 43:35.910
<i>are involved in this huge effort</i>

43:35.980 --> 43:41.179
<i>to try and find the men from there, about</i>
<i>fifteen minutes after the attack took place.</i>

43:42.686 --> 43:47.589
I am going to kill you.

43:52.129 --> 43:56.031
<i>And now, Leslie, we are told</i>
<i>their bodies have been located.</i>

43:56.100 --> 43:57.931
<i>Which leaves us
with many questions.</i>

43:58.002 --> 44:00.197
<i>Some of which you may be</i>
<i>able to answer today.</i>

44:00.270 --> 44:03.205
<i>And some of which you may not.</i>
<i>Who took them?</i>

44:03.273 --> 44:05.969
<i>How were they treated?
Were they tortured?</i>

44:06.043 --> 44:08.477
<i>What condition were they in</i>
<i>when they were found?</i>

44:08.545 --> 44:12.208
<i>Where are the bodies now? And have</i>
<i>the families of the soldiers been notified?</i>

44:20.858 --> 44:25.158
- I want ice cream!
- You have had enough sugar today.

44:25.229 --> 44:27.220
No I haven't!

44:34.371 --> 44:35.497
Whoa.

44:45.616 --> 44:49.108
Would you like to try
our delicious new fat free Gouda?

44:51.689 --> 44:54.419
Would you like to try
our delicious new fat free Gouda?

44:54.491 --> 44:55.651
Yeah!

44:58.228 --> 45:03.530
Listen, will you run in there and get
some plastic wrap and sandwich bags?

45:04.068 --> 45:06.559
Okay. What are you guys going to do?

45:07.705 --> 45:11.334
- We are going to get our faces painted.
- Okay, over there?

45:12.743 --> 45:15.211
- Yeah.
- All right. I'll go in, buy the stuff

45:15.279 --> 45:17.839
and meet you back right there
in two minutes.

45:17.915 --> 45:19.644
I'll be right back.

45:24.488 --> 45:27.423
All right, come on you guys, let us go.

45:27.491 --> 45:29.482
All right, don't step in it.

45:30.594 --> 45:34.360
Sandwich... Sandwich... Sandwich bags.

45:34.431 --> 45:38.561
Oh, excuse me. Could you reach
a few boxes of that tin foil for me?

45:42.606 --> 45:46.303
Yes. Here you go.

45:48.045 --> 45:49.945
Thank you very much.

46:00.958 --> 46:02.050
Hi.

46:07.965 --> 46:10.160
That will be $8.09.

46:13.103 --> 46:15.003
I don't have any money with me.

46:15.072 --> 46:17.870
Can I just run outside,
and I'll be right back?

46:19.309 --> 46:21.004
You want to just take it?

46:21.078 --> 46:22.705
What? No.

46:22.780 --> 46:26.375
It is okay, our inventory system
is totally screwed up.

46:27.317 --> 46:31.253
- No.
- Hey, you want some watermelon?

46:32.189 --> 46:34.919
Not that bruised. Pretty tasty.

46:34.992 --> 46:38.018
No. I'll just... My sister-in-law...
I'll be right back.

46:39.129 --> 46:42.758
And where do you think you are going?
Get your butt back out there.

46:44.902 --> 46:46.335
Oh, you think that is funny?

46:46.403 --> 46:49.736
Okay then, why don't you take
second shiftinside Mr. Fromage?

46:49.807 --> 46:53.106
What? Oh, come on Frank. No!

46:53.844 --> 46:56.005
Hey, I need some money for the stuff.

46:56.880 --> 46:59.007
It is in my purse, behind me.

47:00.918 --> 47:02.044
Wait.

47:14.298 --> 47:15.424
Here.

47:16.867 --> 47:19.893
Okay. Thanks. I'll be right back.

47:42.459 --> 47:46.987
God damn. Well, what in the hell
is the service pump?

47:49.266 --> 47:50.995
- Hey, Kathleen?
- What?

47:51.735 --> 47:53.862
Oh, it is you. What do you want?

47:53.937 --> 47:57.998
Are you working today?
Crap, I didn't make any new flyers.

47:58.075 --> 48:01.101
I'll tell you what, just go out anyway.
Just make yourself known.

48:01.178 --> 48:03.476
Do you know anything about electricity?

48:03.547 --> 48:04.673
Actually, I'm not working today.

48:04.748 --> 48:07.342
I just wanted to know if I could
borrow the suit for a few hours.

48:07.417 --> 48:09.146
Borrow the what?

48:12.723 --> 48:14.190
Sorry!

48:14.925 --> 48:16.756
Jesus Christ, relax, bitch.

48:17.628 --> 48:19.493
Now what did you say?
Can you borrow the what?

48:19.563 --> 48:22.430
The suit.
I want to borrow it, briefly.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.669
- For what?
- Well there is this party.

48:26.737 --> 48:29.706
And this woman will pay me to be
there and entertain, in the suit.

48:29.773 --> 48:31.570
You are not going to
get jizz on it, are you?

48:31.642 --> 48:33.735
What? Oh, no.

48:33.810 --> 48:36.506
Is this one of those plushy things?
Because I don't know about that.

48:36.580 --> 48:39.310
I mean, unless you want to pay
for the dry cleaning. No. Even then, no.

48:39.383 --> 48:42.910
No, it is just a kid's birthday party.
I'll just be there for like an hour.

48:42.986 --> 48:47.446
I could use the money. And I just thought
I'd ask before I took the suit.

48:50.294 --> 48:53.161
- Just bring it back in one piece.
- Okay.

48:54.031 --> 48:57.899
- And clean... Bring it back clean.
- Okay.

48:58.535 --> 49:00.002
Clean.

49:02.005 --> 49:03.131
Shit.

49:14.518 --> 49:17.851
Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't realize
this was a changing room.

49:19.056 --> 49:21.456
Oh. Hello.

49:23.026 --> 49:26.621
- Are you working here?
- Today I am. We are catering this.

49:27.931 --> 49:32.265
- What are you doing?
- I'm the entertainment for the kids.

49:32.336 --> 49:33.860
Just like John Wayne Gacy.

49:33.937 --> 49:36.963
No, I'm just getting paid
to be here for the party.

49:38.642 --> 49:42.134
Look, can you do my zipper
and help me with the head?

49:42.212 --> 49:44.772
I can't get in and out
of this thing by myself.

49:48.885 --> 49:52.548
All right everybody, I have a big surprise.
Have a seat. Have a seat.

49:52.622 --> 49:56.217
Are you ready? Ready? Here we go.

50:09.306 --> 50:10.933
Yay!

50:11.608 --> 50:13.838
Come on, let us take this outside.

51:52.476 --> 51:54.876
And my dad, he is on a boat
and he went to the desert.

51:54.945 --> 51:57.641
And there are tanks.
And he can blow up stuff if he wants to.

51:57.714 --> 52:01.980
He can do stuff,
like he can blow up cactuses.

52:05.522 --> 52:07.752
Hey! A pony!

52:26.042 --> 52:28.237
I heard about the accident.

52:28.311 --> 52:29.903
No, I didn't invite them.

52:29.980 --> 52:32.710
Apparently, the neighbors
have some sort of restraining order.

52:32.782 --> 52:34.409
No, it is a lovely party, really.

52:34.484 --> 52:36.816
I just have to get
ahold of my locations.

52:38.355 --> 52:41.688
Great work.
Can you stay until after the ponies go?

52:41.758 --> 52:45.694
Here, have a piece of cake.
And don't let me forget to pay you.

52:46.563 --> 52:50.124
Boo-freaking-hoo, I feel so sorry for you
because you have eight zillion dollars

52:50.200 --> 52:51.565
and your company went under.

52:51.635 --> 52:54.160
I mean, I'm just not that sympathetic to him.

52:54.237 --> 52:58.901
I'm good. I'm better.
I have been running.

52:58.975 --> 53:01.944
Like twenty five miles a day.
I can probably do a triathlon.

53:02.012 --> 53:04.242
Believe me, I heard it firsthand.

53:04.314 --> 53:06.544
Well, you know, I know it for a fact.

53:06.616 --> 53:09.050
He has been gone forever,
these things happen.

53:09.119 --> 53:12.418
That poor guy.
When does he come home from Iraq?

53:12.489 --> 53:15.083
Well, it was supposed to be
a few months ago.

53:15.158 --> 53:17.422
But you know,
they extended everybody over there.

53:17.494 --> 53:18.859
I saw that graph in <i>USA Today.</i>

53:18.929 --> 53:20.863
- Oh yeah.
- So terrible.

53:21.798 --> 53:23.993
Do you think he has any idea?

53:25.468 --> 53:28.301
Tell me, tell me...

53:28.738 --> 53:32.902
What I heard was that they have probably
been together the whole time.

53:32.976 --> 53:34.409
Even before he left.

53:34.477 --> 53:39.141
Liz says she is going to leave him for Brad,
her boss. Can you believe that?

53:39.216 --> 53:42.117
If she was smart she would leave him
before what's-his-name gets back from Iran.

53:42.185 --> 53:43.584
- Iraq.
- Oh, whatever.

53:43.653 --> 53:45.450
- And they have two kids, right?
- Yes.

53:45.522 --> 53:48.650
- Oh, Rita! Hi! How are you?
- Oh, my God.

53:48.725 --> 53:51.785
She just turned to him and said,
"I want out of the marriage."

53:51.861 --> 53:54.796
I just don't enjoy myself anymore,
you know?

53:54.864 --> 53:59.062
I can't even answer the phone.
I just sit there in the darkness.

53:59.135 --> 54:02.161
- I need a drink.
- Okay.

54:05.041 --> 54:06.702
What do I do?

54:42.812 --> 54:47.772
Nice seeing you guys. Bye-bye, buddy.
Jamie. Good to see you.

54:48.918 --> 54:53.321
- I wonder where their mother is?
- Oh, where do you think?

54:53.957 --> 54:56.983
Are you going to drive them home?

54:57.060 --> 54:59.961
Please. I'm sure John will, eventually.

55:00.030 --> 55:02.692
You think I can call them a cab?

55:02.766 --> 55:06.224
- Is that inappropriate?
- Oh my gosh, a key.

55:06.970 --> 55:10.406
- You are so bad.
- No, me? Please.

55:11.041 --> 55:14.807
I mean seriously. Don't they have a
nanny or an au pair living with them?

55:14.878 --> 55:19.508
Oh yeah, but have you seen him?
He is totally bizarre.

55:19.582 --> 55:21.015
I can't handle it.

55:21.084 --> 55:23.518
You have to hire good help.

55:23.586 --> 55:25.645
- It is all about good help.
- Poor kids.

55:33.930 --> 55:34.988
Damn it.

56:31.388 --> 56:33.447
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:35.325 --> 56:36.656
Come in.

56:49.906 --> 56:52.033
You were inside there?

56:52.876 --> 56:53.934
Yes.

56:55.311 --> 56:57.939
That thing was you?

57:03.686 --> 57:07.918
- Okay now, are you guys ready to go home?
- Yes.

57:10.093 --> 57:13.859
Oh, hi. I'm here to pick up
Cameron and Lincoln.

57:14.597 --> 57:16.792
- And you are?
- Their uncle.

57:17.434 --> 57:20.528
Right.
Well, I don't know where they are.

57:20.603 --> 57:22.468
- Oh, here they are now.
- Here you go.

57:22.539 --> 57:25.804
- Coincidence.
- The head didn't fit in the trunk.

57:25.875 --> 57:28.207
- So I just stuffed it under the seat.
- Okay.

57:28.278 --> 57:30.872
Okay. So, thanks.
That is all. Thank you.

57:30.947 --> 57:34.246
Oh. And also, Barbara,
the woman with the thing.

57:34.317 --> 57:37.047
She thinks that you have gained
a lot of weight.

57:37.120 --> 57:40.055
But I think that, that is just because
she was talking to Nancy.

57:40.123 --> 57:43.320
Who says that Jane is sleeping
with your husband.

57:43.393 --> 57:46.021
And you don't know about it.
Okay, thanks.

57:46.863 --> 57:47.989
What?

57:57.540 --> 57:59.030
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hi.

57:59.108 --> 58:02.737
Oh... Oh, the party is over.

58:02.812 --> 58:07.010
I know, I'm sorry.
How are you? Hi.

58:08.551 --> 58:10.416
- Hi, Leslie. How are you?
- Good.

58:13.122 --> 58:15.989
So, I just came to get the kids.
Are they playing?

58:16.059 --> 58:18.687
Oh, no, no. They are gone.

58:18.761 --> 58:20.729
- That Salamander...
- Salman.

58:20.797 --> 58:22.822
Whatever his name is.
He came to pick them up.

58:22.899 --> 58:24.591
I thought you knew.

58:25.034 --> 58:27.628
No, I did. I did.
I just wasn't sure.

58:27.704 --> 58:32.732
All right. Well do you want to stay
and have a glass of wine or chai?

58:33.276 --> 58:35.073
I have to get going.

58:35.144 --> 58:36.975
But thanks anyway.

58:37.046 --> 58:39.014
- Say hi to Harold for me, Beth, okay?
- I will.

58:39.082 --> 58:41.482
- Bye, Betty. Thanks a lot.
- Rain check, okay.

58:41.551 --> 58:45.385
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

58:46.222 --> 58:49.385
Okay. The fire engine light is on.

58:49.459 --> 58:51.950
And let us see,
we have the curtains half way open.

58:52.028 --> 58:53.859
The teeth are mostly brushed.

58:53.930 --> 58:55.921
And your story book is right here.

58:55.999 --> 58:58.263
I'm not going to read it.
Your mom will do that when she gets here.

58:58.334 --> 59:03.397
I think that is it. So we are ready for bed.
Time for bed.

59:07.944 --> 59:10.469
What are you doing?
What is going on?

59:12.081 --> 59:15.642
- We have a question.
- Okay. What is it?

59:17.220 --> 59:18.881
Can you fly?

59:22.125 --> 59:23.183
No.

59:23.259 --> 59:25.352
Well, can you shoot
lasers out of your eyes?

59:25.428 --> 59:26.690
What? No.

59:26.763 --> 59:29.288
Melt him. Melt him with your eyes.
<i>Quick before Mommy gets home.</i>

59:29.365 --> 59:31.424
Hey, hey. Hey. No.

59:32.635 --> 59:35.229
I'm not a bad guy.

59:36.272 --> 59:39.298
I'm for good. I'm a good guy.

59:40.310 --> 59:42.608
You are here to protect us?

59:45.381 --> 59:46.575
Yes.

59:46.683 --> 59:48.344
And mom?

59:49.218 --> 59:51.948
Yes. For now.

59:57.527 --> 01:00:00.189
Here, read us our story.

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:06.894
Okay.

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.937
- No, you.
- Let's cover you up here.

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:18.310
Hello? Salman? Hello?

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.640
Oh, there they are. Okay.

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:27.383
- Peppie tonight?
- No, no. Here we go, let us put him in there.

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.449
I got to the party a little late
to pick them up.

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:32.687
And they were gone.

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:35.287
- No, I got them.
- Well, I figured.

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.490
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:41.095
- Okay, here you go.
- You go to bed.

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:42.398
I'm going to go to bed.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:45.032
Do you have their book? The story book?

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:46.769
Yeah. We did that.

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:51.209
Okay, okay. Good night. Good night.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.306
- You.
- Okay, you go to sleep.

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:56.511
And this goes right here.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:01:01.621
Okay. Now, which night light?

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:06.085
Anubis, Egyptian jackal god,
or melted football shape?

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.686
- Melted football shape.
- Egyptian.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.636
Yeah so, they are asleep now.

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:26.111
And you know I have Wednesday off.
So I thought maybe

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:28.776
I could take them to the zoo.
On Wednesday.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.654
I think they would like that.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.548
When are you leaving?

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:39.486
What do you mean?

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:42.690
Well, you must have enough money
for a bus ticket now.

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:46.362
But Noah doesn't get home
for another four months.

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:47.960
And?

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:53.073
Well, I thought you said
you couldn't afford the day care?

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:59.642
I think I can probably manage it now.
My boss gave me a raise.

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:10.959
Well, I don't mind staying.

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:13.052
It is up to you, I guess.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:51.093
Her? That whore can piss off!
I don't know who she thinks she is.

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:53.727
Feeding me all that bullshit every day.

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:56.863
Oh yeah, she is going to sleep with him.
And then he won't call her.

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:59.806
And who is going to have to
hear about it every day?

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:05.644
That bitch. I'm really tired of her
yakking all the time.

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:08.309
Why would I care? I don't know her.

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:13.754
She just yaps all the time
about how wonderful she is.

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:15.814
And about how great this guy is.

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:18.884
Anyway, what is going on with you?

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:22.430
Did you get that thing
burnt off your head?

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:26.252
Oh, wow. What is this?

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:29.123
Hey.

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:34.902
Hi.
Are you selling fireworks or something?

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:38.740
- Berries?
- I work for Blunexion.

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:42.007
We are renting out office space.

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:49.212
Oh. I see.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:58.622
- Come on. Let us go.
- Hey, this guy works for your company.

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:04.597
Yeah. A shit-load of good he does us.
Come on, let us go.

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:07.294
Well, very nice to meet you.

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:09.668
What the hell is that?

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:14.801
Jesus, those flyers don't grow on trees.
Pull it together, huh?

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:19.176
So anyway, have a nice day.

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:14.152
Hey!

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:26.938
Hey, what is going on?

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.281
I will be right back.

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:56.030
Hi.

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.603
I'm ready.

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:16.287
Say cheese, assholes!

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:20.028
Come here, you!

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:25.694
Stop it!

01:08:27.336 --> 01:08:28.529
Stop it!

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:34.733
Ha! I didn't feel that at all!

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:48.385
Stop it!

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:55.654
Whoa! You! You get away from her!

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:11.975
You paged me?

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:17.274
Leslie, call the police.
We are being attacked.

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:22.221
By cheese! And that blue thing
is trying to kill us.

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:31.224
Look at these Polaroids.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.631
He is sleeping with her.

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:35.261
They were about... Look at this photo.
He was about to have sex with her.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.635
Right before we got here.
He is having an affair with her.

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:38.968
He is having an affair with both of you.

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:42.533
He is a bad guy.
You can't leave Noah for him.

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:46.604
What are you doing?
They have two kids at home.

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:52.319
He is sleeping with her too.

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:53.854
He is sleeping with both of you.

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:55.754
You can't leave Noah.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.792
You stay the hell away from her!

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:15.973
What is going on here?

01:10:58.554 --> 01:10:59.782
No.

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:55.165
- I love your brother.
- Okay.

01:12:56.605 --> 01:13:00.132
- I wasn't in love with...
- Yeah. That is okay. It is okay.

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:04.875
- Okay. I wasn't going to leave Noah.
- Yeah. It is okay. I believe you.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.187
I wasn't expecting this.

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:17.015
That Noah would just go away.
I mean, I knew it could happen.

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:20.994
Abstractly, I knew it could happen.
I didn't think it would actually happen.

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:23.994
That I would be this war bride.

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:30.169
I mean, and then he was just gone.
Just gone.

01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:40.207
And Brad... And I just...

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:42.978
A year and a half
is a really long time.

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:52.258
- Mommy.
- Yeah?

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:57.722
- The lizard is gone.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.632
I love your brother. I do. I do.

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:11.642
- Yeah, I know.
- I do.

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:14.138
I believe you.

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:22.753
Cameron, what did we say
about the hammer?

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:29.121
- It is my fault. I gave it to him.
- Oh.

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:33.223
- Do you want me take it away?
- Probably not a great toy.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:37.762
- Okay. Sorry.
- It is all right, thank you.

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:48.303
Is that too tight? Okay.

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:54.982
Okay. Go get your coats on.
Get your coats, we have to go.

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:58.078
Hey, guys cut it out!

01:15:58.153 --> 01:16:01.054
Cameron, help your brother up
and apologize.

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.555
And?

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:10.321
Sorry, friends forever.

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:15.400
Let go. Stop hugging me.

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:57.468
I thought we were
going to pick him up?

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:04.516
It is okay.

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:56.636
Okay, go on. It is okay.
That is your dad.

01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:59.007
It is okay.
Go on.

01:19:59.008 --> 01:20:00.008
