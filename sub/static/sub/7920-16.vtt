WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:04.536
Good night, Sam. Uh, you got any
place I can put this change?

00:04.538 --> 00:06.105
Fahboh heh-mah.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.140
(garbled by mouth guard):
All right, sorry.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.708
I thought we had, uh, wrapped up

00:09.710 --> 00:10.976
the talking portion
of the evening.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.311
Uh, football helmet.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.612
You're a Bears fan?

00:13.614 --> 00:15.881
Oh, you know,
sometimes in life

00:15.883 --> 00:17.549
we collect things.
Trinkets.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.219
Some sentimental, some not.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.654
Nick gave it to me.
Is that, is that weird?

00:22.656 --> 00:24.556
N-n-no, that's fine. I, uh,

00:24.558 --> 00:26.859
can't really believe
I'm saying this, 'cause

00:26.861 --> 00:29.661
Nick being in your life has
definitely been hard for me,

00:29.663 --> 00:31.363
but I'm getting used to it.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.898
(garbled by mouth guard):
That makes me so happy.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.501
Hey, this is
gonna sound crazy,

00:35.503 --> 00:40.072
but my parents
are in town tomorrow,

00:40.074 --> 00:41.807
and I thought maybe you
could come meet them.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.208
Yes, I'd love that.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.477
Good. You know, family's
real important to me,

00:45.479 --> 00:47.146
and before I introduce you,

00:47.148 --> 00:49.048
I just wanted to make
sure that we were solid.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.083
We are so solid.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.758
(gasps)

00:59.760 --> 01:01.493
(quietly):
Cece.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.664
(quietly): I had a sex dream.
So?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.500
(quietly):
It was about Nick.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.269
(whisper-yell):
No!

01:10.271 --> 01:11.904
(whisper-yell):
I know!

01:11.906 --> 01:14.006
♪ ♪

01:15.709 --> 01:18.210
Where are my leftovers?

01:18.212 --> 01:19.578
What? Who cares?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.046
I care. I brought it up.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.948
I left perfectly nice
leftovers in the fridge,

01:22.950 --> 01:24.283
and I expect them to be there.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.350
Well, now they're not.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.485
End of discussion.
No.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.021
Middle of discussion.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.356
You're not even
gonna look at me?

01:32.626 --> 01:33.892
When you throw away my stuff,

01:33.894 --> 01:35.060
you're throwing me away.
Mm-hmm.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.195
I wanted to have

01:36.197 --> 01:37.763
cold scallop pizza
for breakfast,

01:37.765 --> 01:39.264
and you took that from me.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.532
You took that from me.

01:40.534 --> 01:41.700
I hope you can live
with yourself.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.068
You're disgusting.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.803
I'm actually really happy that
you're eating breakfast, Nick.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.238
It's nice to know that you're
taking care of yourself.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.406
Thank you.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.775
Well, I'm on my
way to meet Aly

01:49.777 --> 01:51.477
and her boyfriend for brunch.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.046
(laughing): And I am super
excited to meet him.

01:54.048 --> 01:55.881
Yeah, that was sarcasm.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.416
And this is shark-casm:

01:57.418 --> 02:00.052
I just hate eating people.

02:00.054 --> 02:02.254
Dear Lord, do you mean to tell
me that you're going to brunch

02:02.256 --> 02:04.256
with the woman that you love
and her boyfriend?

02:04.258 --> 02:06.058
That's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.093
No, it's not that bad. I mean,
I'm in a prank marriage, anyway.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.595
And I'm over Aly, so...

02:09.597 --> 02:11.063
Don't you lie to me, Winston.
I'm not lying.

02:11.065 --> 02:13.065
You and both know
that you are not

02:13.067 --> 02:15.234
even a little bit over Aly.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.069
I'm coming with you.

02:17.071 --> 02:18.237
All right, fine, Schmidt,
you can come.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.471
But please, do me a favor?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.473
Don't be weird and start
smelling people's bread.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.309
Either you eat bread,
or you don't eat bread.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.278
There's nothing in between, man.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.846
So in the dream,
what was Nick...

02:27.848 --> 02:29.515
He was wearing this.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.984
He was wearing a frickin'
football helmet. Ah, damn.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.418
What happened next was primal.

02:33.420 --> 02:34.686
Man versus woman.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.588
The ancient battle of the flesh.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.290
Calm down. It's probably
just happening

02:38.292 --> 02:40.325
because you're getting
more serious with Sam.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.693
Yes.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.595
And Sam is finally,
just a little bit,

02:43.597 --> 02:45.364
sort of, starting to trust me.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.099
And he wants me
to meet his parents.

02:47.101 --> 02:49.101
You can't meet
a man's parents if your ex

02:49.103 --> 02:50.702
is making love
to you in your head.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.137
I need my mind

02:52.139 --> 02:54.106
Nick-free by tonight.

02:54.108 --> 02:57.109
On this bed is
everything Nick gave me

02:57.111 --> 02:58.544
while we were together.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.946
I'm going to get rid of it
to clear my subconscious.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.181
All right.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.182
Good-bye, sex helmet.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.349
Good-bye, uh,

03:04.351 --> 03:06.385
lacquered bagel
with my name on it.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.453
Good-bye, world's
tiniest hedgehog.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.488
That was a gift?

03:09.490 --> 03:11.223
Good-bye almost
done Rubik's Cube.

03:11.225 --> 03:14.993
Literally, it was one turn
from the end

03:14.995 --> 03:17.996
and he would not finish it. That
makes sense with Nick, though.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.698
People try to pretend like
the brain is so complicated,

03:19.700 --> 03:21.733
but I feel better already.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.836
Well, the two most important men

03:24.838 --> 03:26.405
in my life are finally meeting.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.509
And for some reason this
other guy's here. Yo.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.910
Hey, brunch is on
me today, guys, okay?

03:31.912 --> 03:33.745
So, feel free to add
blue cheese to anything.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.647
I'm an agent for animal actors.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.649
He's doing pretty good.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.518
He recently signed the crow
from<i> Game of Thrones.</i>

03:39.520 --> 03:41.587
Darnell. You know his name.
Darnell. That's right.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.722
I didn't realize an animal
agent was a real job.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.158
Let me put it to you this way,
so the next<i> Avatar</i> movie

03:46.160 --> 03:48.060
takes place on a cat planet,

03:48.062 --> 03:50.495
and, uh, I was the first
one they called. Shut up.

03:50.497 --> 03:51.997
I know. I knew you were gonna like that.
A cat planet?

03:51.999 --> 03:53.198
I know.
He swore me to secrecy.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.399
I was gonna tell you.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.235
My good... you know,
I always thought

03:56.237 --> 03:57.536
Furguson should be
in the movies.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.538
Would you interested in,
uh, I don't know,

03:59.540 --> 04:01.006
taking a meeting with him?

04:01.008 --> 04:02.407
He's got no representation,
so he's...

04:02.409 --> 04:04.409
Let me guess. Wait.
He has an adorable yawn?

04:04.411 --> 04:05.410
Yeah.
Of course he does.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.346
He's a<i> cat.</i>

04:07.348 --> 04:09.715
But can he show up
every day to work?

04:09.717 --> 04:11.717
I run a business. Pass.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.585
Yeah, never mind. Dumb idea.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.054
Tripp, you have got
to sit down with Furguson.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.422
He's literally one
of the most beautiful creatures

04:17.424 --> 04:18.590
I've ever laid eyes on.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.058
Really? I thought you hated him.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.027
I thought you hated cats
in general, actually.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.229
I love Furguson, are you
kidding me? It's Furguson.

04:24.231 --> 04:27.633
He's got that, uh... he's got
the little, uh, his, uh...

04:27.635 --> 04:28.867
You know, his front?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.469
Does he have a headshot?

04:30.471 --> 04:33.972
No, but W-Winston,
actually does have a lot

04:33.974 --> 04:36.108
of 8x10 photos
of the cat's face.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.310
All right, fine.
Bring him by my office.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.712
Can't miss it. It's the tallest
building in Beverly Hills.

04:42.216 --> 04:44.750
Hey, hey, hey.
Where'd you get that?

04:44.752 --> 04:46.218
I got this from
the shoulder-less

04:46.220 --> 04:47.986
Dutch boy you live with.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.756
Jess?
Possibly.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.924
That's mine. Why are they
throwing away my stuff?

04:52.926 --> 04:55.294
They're throwing away me.
Give it back.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.928
All right, but my
babies come with it.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.497
I don't want your rock babies.

04:58.499 --> 05:01.466
Well, I'll just keep 'em.
Okay.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.268
(rock clattering)

05:03.270 --> 05:05.570
Sorry, Leviticus.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.005
He's tough.

05:10.644 --> 05:14.279
Why is everyone
throwing away my stuff?

05:14.281 --> 05:15.447
First of all,
that is not your helmet.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.915
You gave that to me.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.784
And second of all,
I need a clean house.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.952
I need a clean room.
A clean mind.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.254
Yeah, dirty room, dirty dreams.

05:22.256 --> 05:24.156
No dirty dreams.
No one had dirty dreams.

05:24.158 --> 05:26.091
What are you talking about?
No dirty dreams.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.593
So there have been dirty dreams?

05:28.595 --> 05:31.596
No. What'd you have
a dream about?

05:32.633 --> 05:34.099
It's interesting, Jessica.
What was it about?

05:34.101 --> 05:35.701
There was no dream, dude.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.102
Well, which one of you
is gonna crack

05:37.104 --> 05:38.403
and tell me what
the dream was about? Jess?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.406
Or Cece?

05:54.822 --> 05:56.054
You looked at the helmet.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.522
Cece!
I did not. I did not.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.291
You had a sex dream
about a Bear's helmet?

05:59.293 --> 06:00.625
Who was wearing it?
Ditka?

06:00.627 --> 06:02.160
Vic Fangio? John Fox?

06:02.162 --> 06:03.962
Our GM, Ryan Pace?

06:03.964 --> 06:06.531
He's cute, but come on.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.066
She doesn't know any
of those people, Nick.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.334
Cece!
So...

06:09.336 --> 06:10.802
She doesn't know<i> those</i> people.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.304
So it was somebody you know.

06:12.306 --> 06:15.340
There wasn't... No.
Absolutely not. No.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.909
Oh, my God.

06:17.911 --> 06:21.747
You had a sex dream about me.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.014
No.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.850
It was... no... there was no...

06:24.852 --> 06:27.719
Well, well,
well, well, well.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.254
Thanks a lot, Cece. That was my bad.
I'm sorry.

06:29.256 --> 06:32.357
Pancakes and syrup, girls.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.559
Let's eat.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.198
Nick, I have to meet
Sam's parents tonight.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.233
I don't have time for this.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.734
What will it take for you

06:42.736 --> 06:44.169
to just forget about this
and get rid of the helmet?

06:44.171 --> 06:46.037
Oh, just every single detail

06:46.039 --> 06:48.006
about the dream.
Damn.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.775
Now, and this one is a biggie,

06:49.777 --> 06:51.410
was I 100% percent human?
What?

06:51.412 --> 06:52.611
Obviously.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.612
Okay, I'm just trying
to figure out

06:53.614 --> 06:54.746
the reality of the dream.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.081
Well, we were having sex,

06:56.083 --> 06:57.849
so in that sense,

06:57.851 --> 06:59.351
it was not reality-based at all,

06:59.353 --> 07:01.086
because that's never
gonna happen again.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.421
Oh!

07:02.423 --> 07:04.089
You sound like the beginning
of a Salt-N-Pepa song,

07:04.091 --> 07:05.891
and I just wish we could just,
like, act like adults.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.959
Definitely, definitely,
definitely, definitely.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.362
Were you just recreating
our best encounter?

07:10.364 --> 07:11.630
Was it Glove City again?

07:11.632 --> 07:14.433
Our best was not Glove City.
Oh, it wasn't?

07:14.435 --> 07:16.701
It was for you,
but not for me.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.036
So what was our best,
in your opinion?

07:18.038 --> 07:20.439
Ooh, you just walked
right into that one.

07:20.441 --> 07:23.308
Okay, it wasn't something
that actually happened.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.210
It was historical.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.313
Oh, historical,
so was there a dragon?

07:28.315 --> 07:30.515
No, it was historical.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.118
You think dragons are real?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.386
I think there's a lot
of debate about it.

07:34.388 --> 07:35.887
And there's a lot
of blogs about it.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.122
And I know that as a fact,
'cause I've written one.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.657
Do you think dinosaurs
are dragons?

07:38.659 --> 07:39.958
There's debate
about dragons, Jess,

07:39.960 --> 07:41.059
and we're not doing
this right now.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.595
Wow, this office is nice.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.764
(sighs)

07:45.766 --> 07:47.599
M... look, this is
so nice of you, man.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.834
You didn't really have to come.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.268
Of course I came.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.838
I believe in yo...
I believe in Furguson.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.674
Is that offer a joke? Huh?

07:55.676 --> 07:59.611

08:23.670 --> 08:26.471
All right. This is catnip oil.

was caked in soot.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.558
Why was I a chimney sweep?

09:53.560 --> 09:55.460
Well, a chimney is hollow
and you're just like jamming

09:55.462 --> 09:57.228
something into it. What does
that have to do with sex?

09:57.230 --> 09:58.730
Get a hold of yourself.
Sorry.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.098
So you took me to a dark,
Victorian alley.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.933
It was filthy.
I was on top.

10:01.935 --> 10:02.934
Okay, I'm okay with that.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.302
Our passion drowns out

10:04.304 --> 10:06.237
the coughs from
the orphans inside.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.539
And then Winston
brings us scones.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.740
And that's it.

10:08.742 --> 10:09.908
Really sweet of him.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.276
I'm starving after sex,

10:11.278 --> 10:12.611
especially when I
have to lay on my back.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.045
You're starving all the time.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.614
Who invited you in this room?
JESS: All right?

10:15.616 --> 10:17.549
Are we good?
Can we get rid of the helmet?

10:17.551 --> 10:18.950
I'm concerned, as a friend,

10:18.952 --> 10:22.621
that Sam isn't
satisfying you sexually.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.922
I can confidently say

10:23.924 --> 10:26.157
that's not what this is about.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.994
Maybe he's just not rotating
your tires enough, Jess. What?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.562
You know you need that at
least once a month. Nick.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.497
For sex, that's not enough.

10:32.499 --> 10:36.167
And for literal tire rotation,
that's way too frequent.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.736
Not when you drive like I do.

10:37.738 --> 10:38.803
Not...

10:38.805 --> 10:40.905
when you drive like I do.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.273
I have to get ready
to meet Sam's parents.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.908
Will you please get out of here?

10:43.910 --> 10:45.410
Yes. I'm leaving,

10:45.412 --> 10:47.245
but I will not
throw away this helmet.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.681
Why? You didn't care about that
helmet when you gave it to me!

10:49.683 --> 10:51.516
Yes, I did.
It was a Christmas gift.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.318
I gave you a Christmas present,

10:53.320 --> 10:56.788
and you said,
"Christmas? What? Hold up."

10:56.790 --> 10:58.023
And then you went
and got that helmet.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.491
Unwrapped.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.759
What was I supposed
to do with it?

11:00.761 --> 11:02.494
Wear it?
I wouldn't do...

11:02.496 --> 11:05.096
Oh, the perfect ensemble
for a night at the theater.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.598
Throw whatever you want at me,
Blue Men.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.899
I'm ready.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.603
Oh, crap. That's Sam. Ugh.

11:11.605 --> 11:14.205
Okay, why won't this come off?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.540
Probably because it's
a child-size medium.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.442
What?!

11:17.444 --> 11:19.177
Why would you give me
a child's helmet?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.278
I didn't think you
were gonna put it on.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.946
Cece, help me, help me.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.982
Yeah, I got you. I can't meet
Sam's parents like this.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.850
Okay, ready?

11:25.852 --> 11:27.285
NICK:
It's not going to help.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.787
Okay, no, it's-it's
really stuck, babe.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.821
Suck your head in.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.489
I can't suck my head in.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.024
Then throw a jersey on
and pants,

11:33.026 --> 11:34.125
and just pretend you're
a little football player.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.027
I can't go out
with a helmet.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.295
You look ridiculous.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.963
I'm aware.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.703
Cece, can you go out there
and stall Sam?

11:44.705 --> 11:46.037
He knows that Nick
gave me this helmet

11:46.039 --> 11:48.640
(knocking)
and he can't see me in it.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.075
Okay, what's my lie? Chlamydia?

11:50.077 --> 11:53.011
No! No! Anything else.
Literally, anything else.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.212
Okay, anything else, okay.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.583
Hey, hey, Legs.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.919
What's up?

12:00.921 --> 12:03.822
You and I have never
really clicked, huh?

12:03.824 --> 12:04.923

Patches is walking
like a person.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.605
This was a enormous mistake.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.749
Is it, um, hard
being a doctor?

12:30.751 --> 12:32.584
Yeah.
Oh.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.252
What's taking Jess so long?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.187

12:48.902 --> 12:51.469
You gave me something
that your dad gave you?

12:54.141 --> 12:58.376

to put dirty change in.

I get it as much as someone

living, healthy parents can.

was that too harsh?

You know what?
I'm just gonna

13:25.071 --> 13:26.304
No.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.007

how to get it off.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.776

I don't want to

put it back in.

Oh. No, no. There was
a scallop pizza...

14:01.441 --> 14:02.974
No, I was mad at Nick,

14:02.976 --> 14:04.509
...and it was in the fridge.
so I put the helmet on.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.543
Schmidt threw it away.

Okay, um...

14:08.381 --> 14:09.647

14:12.052 --> 14:14.185
Let me back up.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.954
Last night, you asked me
about this helmet.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.822
Sorry. Let me fast forward.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.791
The helmet's stuck on my head.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.560
Look, I know this
is a lot to ask,

14:22.562 --> 14:26.030
but is there any way,
you could just trust me

14:26.032 --> 14:30.301
when I tell you that
it was just a stupid sex dream.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.572
Okay, yes. Yeah, no.
I trust you.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.774

Do you guys have
a screwdriver or a hammer?

14:47.721 --> 14:51.723
Oh, um, we can't break it
'cause...

14:51.725 --> 14:54.759
Nick's dad gave it to him.

14:57.030 --> 15:00.398
Right. Uh, well...

the self-esteem.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.396
Don't worry about Furguson,
okay?

15:31.398 --> 15:33.264

Patches is Tripp, all right?

16:31.091 --> 16:32.357
(meow)
Aha!

16:32.359 --> 16:33.992
(Patches meowing)

16:33.994 --> 16:35.593
It looks like Patches is gonna
have a little trouble

16:35.595 --> 16:37.128
concentrating on her audition.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.831
(people shouting)

16:39.833 --> 16:41.833
(stammering)

16:41.835 --> 16:43.334
God save me.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.504
Furguson, avenge me!

16:46.506 --> 16:47.772
Avenge me!

16:47.774 --> 16:49.340
(cats meowing)

16:55.648 --> 16:57.515
I need a straw.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.783
Ugh, I should be
charming the pants off

16:58.785 --> 17:01.386
Sam's parents right now.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.453
NICK:
Jess.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.222
We're gonna break it.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.190
But what about your dad?

17:06.192 --> 17:08.059
Look, it sucks to admit,

17:08.061 --> 17:11.362
but Sam's a really good guy
with above average handsomeness.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.732
And he's above six feet tall,
which I know means a lot to you.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.968
And he makes you happy,
and so...

17:18.171 --> 17:19.704
...I think it's time for me to

17:19.706 --> 17:22.440
stop coming
in between you guys.

17:25.345 --> 17:28.146
Let's do this. Let's have
a little bit of fun, huh?

17:28.148 --> 17:30.148
(clattering)

17:31.317 --> 17:33.918
I will be going
on the count of three.

17:33.920 --> 17:34.986
Okay.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.688
One, two, three, four, fi...

17:37.690 --> 17:38.823
What are you doing?

17:38.825 --> 17:40.224
You never go on three.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.559
You want to catch
the patient off guard.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.161
It's less scary that way.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.396
Everybody knows it.
It's just a doctor trick.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.832
Nick. So this time I
am going on three.

17:48.835 --> 17:52.336
One, two, three, four...
Do it!

17:52.338 --> 17:54.172
(Nick and Jess yelling)

17:55.575 --> 18:00.211
So this is the famous Patches.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.013
No. I am...

Winston L'andre Bishop

the king of cats.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.455
Lover of mats.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.523
No friend of rats.

I was four steps
away from freedom,

(sighs)
and I fell.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.171
Oh, they were on me,

I was their city,

May I just please take
a moment with Patches?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.010
She needs a, a moment
to center herself.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.778
She almost
OD'd on catnip.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.180
Forget about Patches.

more cats like Furguson.

What? What? You were
laughing at him.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.285
He's an original.

like a Culkin brother.

What?!

19:16.923 --> 19:18.623
(laughing)

19:18.625 --> 19:20.024
It's hard
to celebrate this moment

19:20.026 --> 19:23.361

in my mouth.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.629
You did it, buddy.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.197

Now you're gloating?

19:26.199 --> 19:27.632

Ah.

I mean, you're already
so intimidating.

Do you have to go out of
your way to actually get at me?

19:34.040 --> 19:35.606
Intimidating?

19:35.608 --> 19:37.375
Aly talks about you
all the time, obviously.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.343
You're a cop.
You're a hero.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.180
Last weekend, I went to
a turtle's birthday party.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.447
This is oddly emotional.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.850

Yes.
