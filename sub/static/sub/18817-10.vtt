WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:07.215
Hey, Pen, you busy?

00:07.299 --> 00:09.884
Yes. My mom is at the opera
with Dr. Berkowitz,

00:09.967 --> 00:11.053
both kids are out of the house

00:11.136 --> 00:13.638
and I am finally enjoying
some time to myself.

00:13.721 --> 00:16.516
Ooh, wine and coupons. Been there.

00:17.392 --> 00:21.020
Just substitute wine with whiskey,
and coupons with more whiskey.

00:23.481 --> 00:26.734
-Did you want something?
-Just to share some amazing news.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.112
I am... unplugged.

00:29.862 --> 00:33.450
Yeah. No more Internet, no social media,
not even a phone.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.785
Anyway, I really need
to use your computer.

00:35.868 --> 00:37.829
[chuckles] That was quick.

00:37.912 --> 00:40.873
-Why don't you use your own laptop?
-I locked it in my safe.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.710
-So?
-Combination to my safe is on my laptop.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.213
You didn't think to write it down--

00:46.296 --> 00:49.299
We all wish we had the last five minutes
of our life back, okay?

00:51.384 --> 00:52.510
I'm with you there!

00:52.594 --> 00:56.223
Anyway, I need to find a new place
to get my eyebrows threaded.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.058
Oh, you can just do
everything else silently.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.352
-[sighs]
-[woman moaning on laptop]

01:00.435 --> 01:01.269
Whoa!

01:04.106 --> 01:06.941
-Schneider, you came here to watch porn?
-No!

01:07.024 --> 01:08.901
-[pressing keys rapidly]
-Why won't it stop?

01:08.985 --> 01:11.321
No, I don't wanna chat with you!

01:13.656 --> 01:15.242
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:15.325 --> 01:18.661
[chuckles] Oh, come on, Pen.
No need to cover.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.623
I'm just happy you weren't actually
sittin' there clipping coupons.

01:23.916 --> 01:25.418
And a threesome, eh?

01:26.836 --> 01:28.630
Get your freak on, boo!

01:29.297 --> 01:30.840
Shut up, that's not my porn.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.009
-It's your computer.
-No, it's not my...

01:35.887 --> 01:37.222
It's Alex's.

01:40.057 --> 01:42.477
I'll just use
the old eyebrow-threading place.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.938
[theme song playing]

02:34.154 --> 02:35.196
Oh.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.450
[sighs] My baby's watching porn.

02:39.367 --> 02:42.662
[sighs] My sweet boy
is becoming a gross man!

02:43.580 --> 02:46.458
But, hey, silver lining, it's normal porn.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.211
A threesome is not normal.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.546
Okay, fine. It's aspirational.

02:54.131 --> 02:57.510
-How do I talk to him about this?
-Uh... you don't.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.637
I'm not looking forward to this, either.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.056
But I have to
because he's obviously curious.

03:02.139 --> 03:04.892
And I don't want it to get stuck
in his brain that this is what sex is.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.147
Yeah. He'd be in
for a long series of disappointments.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.985
What kinda sex talk
did your parents give you?

03:14.068 --> 03:15.862
Because I wanna do the opposite of that.

03:16.863 --> 03:21.117
Well, Father believed it's best to have
this kinda discussion in a car

03:21.200 --> 03:23.035
because you don't have
to make eye contact.

03:23.119 --> 03:27.540
Plus, you're traveling in the
same direction, which fosters intimacy.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.251
That's actually good advice.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.920
I was expecting
some unrelatable rich-guy story.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.298
So we're in the Bentley
with our chauffeur, Paco.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.969
Father said it's time to have the talk.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.389
We came to the next stoplight.
He hopped out, Paco told me everything.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.642
I need a Paco.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.729
I got a cousin named Paco,
but he's an idiot.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.691
Ay,  it's not fair that I'm stuck
giving both sex talks.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.402
Alex was supposed to be Victor's job.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.779
-I did my part with Elena.
-How'd it go?

03:57.862 --> 03:58.905
Not great.

03:59.697 --> 04:02.158
She asked me what a period was
when she was seven.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.369
I didn't get the period talk
till I was 12.

04:05.953 --> 04:07.955
Paco just called it "Shark Week."

04:13.336 --> 04:16.381
Well, they say you should answer
every question honestly, so I did.

04:17.006 --> 04:20.218
And I ended up going from periods
into the whole sex talk.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.764
Then, Elena said...
"Cool! What's an exclamation point?"

04:27.016 --> 04:29.018
Lucky she didn't ask about a colon.

04:29.101 --> 04:30.395
[laughs]

04:31.562 --> 04:33.731
Sorry, it's just fun to hear
about how you blew it.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.109
It's not like I had a great role model.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.904
My mom's sex talk
was her handing me a white handkerchief

04:39.987 --> 04:41.531
and telling me it was my virginity.

04:43.199 --> 04:46.995
[imitates Lydia] "Lupita,
nobody wants to marry a used handkerchief.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.666
So, you must keep
men from sneezing in it."

04:54.544 --> 04:55.920
Hello.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.131
[normal voice]
Here comes Professor Love now.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.551
-So how was the opera?
-Magnificent.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.679
-Oh, when Violetta died of consumption--
-[Schneider] Hey, hey.

05:04.762 --> 05:05.888
Spoilers.

05:07.390 --> 05:11.644
Sorry, it's just that her death scene
was so... [voice breaks]

05:11.728 --> 05:13.480
[Lydia] Aw. Aw!

05:13.563 --> 05:16.483
Here, you may have my handkerchief.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.781
[moans] Thank you.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.408
[blowing nose loudly]

05:29.120 --> 05:30.580
[whispering] I feel dirty.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.542
The singing was very good.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.420
But the choreography
could have used a little tweaking.

05:37.504 --> 05:41.090
I gave my number to the usher.
I'm sure he'll be calling.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.011
Uh, what was the name of that soprano?

05:45.094 --> 05:47.054
Oh, do you mind
if I just look it up quickly?

05:47.138 --> 05:49.056
-No!
-[woman moaning on laptop]

05:52.309 --> 05:53.770
[man grunting on laptop]

06:02.737 --> 06:04.196
Oh, my stars.

06:07.116 --> 06:10.703
I feel compelled to tell you
that this is not my computer.

06:12.997 --> 06:14.248
No, it's Alex's.

06:14.331 --> 06:16.959
That's what we've been talking about.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.711
What? What about Alex?

06:18.795 --> 06:21.005
Mami,  don't worry.
It's not really a big deal.

06:21.088 --> 06:23.550
Alex was watching a racy movie.
[chuckles nervously]

06:23.633 --> 06:25.051
Cars 2?

06:32.684 --> 06:34.351
More like  Cars 3.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.525
Okay, let's stop talking about this.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.486
Yeah, whatever it was, don't worry.

06:43.570 --> 06:47.574
You know, it's normal for a teenage boy
and it's healthy to be curious.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.742
I'm curious.
I wanna see how that movie ends.

06:51.410 --> 06:53.955
Boy, the world has changed.

06:54.038 --> 06:59.210
I-- Just think how difficult it was
to see a naked woman in the Renaissance.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.838
You had to pay someone a fortune

07:01.921 --> 07:05.633
to create a giant nude painting
that you couldn't hide from your wife.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.096
When I was a kid,
there was an adult section

07:10.179 --> 07:11.889
in the back of the video store.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.183
Behind the beads.

07:15.142 --> 07:16.894
[imitates beads rattling]

07:17.562 --> 07:20.523
I'd always chicken out
and just rent a Jane Fonda workout tape.

07:21.983 --> 07:22.984
Still worked.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.070
Still works.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.824
That's the thing.
It used to be hard to get.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.826
Now there are no restrictions.

07:31.909 --> 07:35.079
You can get a Renaissance painting
right on your computer.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.958
All of this is exactly why
I need to talk to Alex.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.544
You know, with the Internet,
kids see too much too soon.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.797
Then porn makes them grow up thinking
that's what sex is supposed to be like.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.884
How bad was this movie
that  papito  was watching?

07:47.967 --> 07:48.968
-Awful.
-Pretty tame.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.263
Okay. Show me.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.265
[chuckles] Yeah, that's not happening.

07:54.348 --> 07:58.019
Lydia, you asked me to turn away
when you buckled your shoe.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.771
This is not for you.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.648
-Por favor.
- No, Mami.

08:01.731 --> 08:02.732
¡Mira!

08:02.815 --> 08:05.192
I was married for over 40 years.

08:05.276 --> 08:09.155
If anything, it is a shame
that Berto and I went unrecorded.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.532
-¡Dame esa cosa!
-Ay.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.620
[woman moaning on laptop]

08:42.939 --> 08:44.440
Burn this.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.788
Why is everyone staring at me?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.040
Is there a bug on me?

09:01.791 --> 09:03.042
Is there a bug on me?

09:03.751 --> 09:07.171
No,  papito,  you are bug-free
and perfect as always.

09:07.254 --> 09:10.842
Yeah. Stand there,
so I can always remember you this way.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.555
Finn sent me a video to check out.
Have you seen my laptop?

09:15.638 --> 09:16.723
[all] No!

09:17.306 --> 09:20.017
What's wrong? Does it have a virus?

09:20.101 --> 09:22.061
It is sick. Yes.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.606
Is anybody gonna tell me what's going on?

09:25.690 --> 09:28.234
-Yeah, I'm out.
-Yes, I should probably go, too.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.027
Thank you for a lovely evening.

09:31.028 --> 09:31.946
Okay, sit down.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.906
We need to talk about something.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.282
I am going to leave.

09:35.366 --> 09:41.539
Because... this, like many things in life,
can best be done only between two peoples.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.799
-Seriously, what's going on?
-Don't worry. It's nothing bad.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.929
-It's just about sex.
-Oh, God!

09:59.891 --> 10:01.058
Okay...

10:04.770 --> 10:05.605
Great start.

10:07.439 --> 10:08.565
Ay...

10:09.567 --> 10:11.027
Look... [chuckles nervously]

10:11.861 --> 10:15.406
It's totally natural for you
to be curious about sex.

10:18.325 --> 10:20.202
If you ever have any questions,

10:20.286 --> 10:22.705
I want you to feel
like you can come to me.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.047
Do you have any questions?

10:32.423 --> 10:33.424
[Alex] Yes.

10:34.341 --> 10:37.136
When is this going to be over?

10:38.429 --> 10:41.390
I get it.
This is uncomfortable for me, too.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.518
But it's important
to talk about this stuff.

10:44.601 --> 10:48.189
[stuttering] Because I just...
I want you to understand that...

10:48.272 --> 10:49.523
[sighs]

10:51.150 --> 10:55.738
sex can be a really beautiful experience.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.740
[Alex groaning]

10:57.824 --> 10:58.991
I know.

10:59.075 --> 11:02.787
But look... there's reality,
then there's pornography.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.372
[Alex] Why are you doing this to me?

11:06.207 --> 11:08.292
For instance, two women with one man,

11:08.375 --> 11:09.376
-it's just--
-What?

11:09.460 --> 11:11.087
What are you talking about?

11:11.420 --> 11:12.797
You can do that?

11:16.092 --> 11:17.634
Alex, it's okay.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.470
I know you were watching a video like that
on the computer.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.138
-What? No, I wasn't.
-Don't lie to me.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.682
I'm not lying. I'm not stupid.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.476
I know you put software into it
that tells you everything I look at.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.439
That's right, mister.

11:31.816 --> 11:36.779
I did order that and installed that,
and that's how I found out about this.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.449
Mom, you gotta believe me.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.867
I would never do that.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.829
I spent my whole life
trying to avoid this conversation.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.126
Okay. Well, then, if wasn't you,
who was it?

11:51.585 --> 11:53.295
-Was it you?
-No!

11:54.046 --> 11:55.047
It wasn't me.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.801
-Abuelita?
-No!

12:00.469 --> 12:01.720
Hey, guys!

12:01.804 --> 12:03.347
I'm exhausted. Good night.

12:06.517 --> 12:07.977
Elena!

12:12.273 --> 12:15.693
Well, that is unexpected.
Did she admit to watching it?

12:15.777 --> 12:18.112
I didn't have the heart to ask her
about it last night.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.281
After introducing my 12-year-old son
to threesomes,

12:20.364 --> 12:22.825
I figured that was enough great parenting
for one day.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.078
I don't even know
what I'm gonna say to Elena.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.497
I can't believe I have to have
another porn conversation.

12:28.580 --> 12:31.208
Oh, you guys are talking about porn
without my sexpertise?

12:31.292 --> 12:34.545
[scoffs] Great, I was hoping to get
another opinion on this.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.713
Yes, let's catch you up.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.426
We were just saying
that with all the porn available now,

12:40.509 --> 12:41.928
it's a real problem.

12:42.011 --> 12:45.722
Yeah. There's not enough hours in a day
to watch it all. [chuckles]

12:45.807 --> 12:47.183
Okay, so we heard from you.

12:47.266 --> 12:51.062
Well, girls these days are exposed to
so much more than my generation was.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.480
Or... [scoffs]
your generation, Penelope.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.610
-I mean, 15 is the new 25.
-[Penelope] Yes.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.490
And I'm not naive.
But Elena's just not that advanced.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.991
She's never even had a boyfriend.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.577
She just started kinda seeing
this boy named Josh,

13:06.660 --> 13:08.287
but all they've done is kissed.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.289
Aw, you're adorable. [chuckles]

13:14.210 --> 13:17.546
I'm sure Josh is the one teenage boy
that loves just kissing.

13:17.629 --> 13:18.672
[laughing]

13:23.552 --> 13:25.888
Maybe I should be worried about Josh.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.140
Is he pressuring her?

13:29.141 --> 13:31.268
It is confusing for girls out there.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.145
I'm glad I got married so young.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.189
I was still a "virgin."

13:37.774 --> 13:40.987
-What do you mean?
-You know, a "virgin."

13:42.613 --> 13:43.614
What's this?

13:47.659 --> 13:51.705
I was a good Catholic girl,
so I wanted to save myself for marriage.

13:51.789 --> 13:55.459
But there are other ways to do it
that are creative but keep you pure.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.628
"Technically" pure.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.181
I guess we'll all spend
the rest of the day

14:09.265 --> 14:11.892
thinking of ways to look Lori in the eye.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.772
I totally forgot about
that Catholic-girl workaround.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.440
No, I know a bunch of stupid girls
who used...

14:18.524 --> 14:19.942
No, that's not what I...

14:20.026 --> 14:21.235
Ay,  whatever. You got snowed.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.905
I need to talk to Elena.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.827
-Do you want me to talk to Josh?
-I don't even want you to talk to me.

14:31.578 --> 14:34.123
-Big plans this weekend?
-Don't look at me.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.379
Where's Elena?
I really need to talk to her.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.630
You should.

14:41.713 --> 14:43.174
She is a porno.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.386
I think I know what you're saying,
and it's not fair

14:47.469 --> 14:49.513
'cause when you thought it was Alex,
you said it was healthy.

14:49.596 --> 14:52.308
Well, boys are supposed to want the sex.

14:52.391 --> 14:55.394
Girls are supposed to pretend
that they don't want the sex.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.354
Read your Bible, for God's sake.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.773
Watch the hair,  Abuelita.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.402
-Is Elena in her room?
-No, she's at Josh's.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.862
The family is having a movie night,
remember?

15:05.947 --> 15:07.573
-That's tonight?
-Yeah.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.826
Jeez, she's been at Josh's, like,
every day this week.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.787
[sighs] Great. Straight to voicemail.

15:13.870 --> 15:15.206
[takes deep breath]

15:15.289 --> 15:18.875
Elena, I really need to talk to you,
so call me as soon as you get this.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.170
No, better yet,
just come home right away.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.463
No, scratch that.

15:22.546 --> 15:26.258
Come home right away, but still call me
so I know you're coming home.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.219
This is your mother.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.264
[sighs]

15:33.224 --> 15:34.225
It's fine.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.518
I shouldn't worry
'cause she's with his family, right?

15:36.602 --> 15:37.561
Yeah!

15:38.979 --> 15:40.314
What?

15:41.315 --> 15:42.191
What is it?

15:43.192 --> 15:46.779
Well, it's just that some kids at school
said Josh is having a party...

15:47.237 --> 15:48.906
because his parents are out of town.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.825
No parents? That's terrible!

15:51.908 --> 15:53.953
I know! Who's gonna order the pizza?

15:54.036 --> 15:56.205
Who's gonna clean up the mess?

15:56.288 --> 15:57.748
[Penelope panting]

15:59.333 --> 16:02.628
Mami,  parties are not good.
There's alcohol.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.421
Then people pair off.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.589
And the next thing you know,

16:05.672 --> 16:09.010
Carlos Piñero's trying to unhook your bra
on your best friend's parents' bed.

16:09.093 --> 16:09.969
But...

16:11.553 --> 16:13.555
not me,  Mami,  I never did that.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.849
I'm happy to just leave.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.559
Oye.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.895
No seas ridícula.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.732
Elena would never give away her purity
at some party.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.277
[softly] Ah, yes.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.530
-Yes, you're right.
-Of course. She's a good Catholic girl.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.781
Oh, my God!

16:34.035 --> 16:35.786
[music playing]

16:38.830 --> 16:39.873
[doorknob rattles]

16:54.263 --> 16:55.306
[grunts]

16:55.389 --> 16:56.557
What is this?

16:59.143 --> 17:02.021
There's no party.
There's just three of them.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.315
[gasps] Three.

17:05.524 --> 17:07.359
As you can see, ladies,

17:07.443 --> 17:09.611
I've got more than enough
for the both of you.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.953
-[Elena] Ooh, relax, I got it.
-[Penelope gasps]

17:18.037 --> 17:19.121
Elena!

17:19.205 --> 17:22.999
-Mom, what are you doing?
-[shouts] What are you doing?

17:23.084 --> 17:25.877
I'm watching a movie
with Josh and his little sister!

17:25.961 --> 17:26.837
You scared me.

17:28.797 --> 17:29.965
What's going on?

17:30.049 --> 17:33.052
Hey, Barb, Dave. [chuckles]

17:33.135 --> 17:36.305
Ooh. Love these hardwood floors.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.016
What is this, bamboo?

17:40.601 --> 17:42.936
-Penelope, would you like to come in?
-Yeah, sure.

17:43.019 --> 17:44.438
You know, let me just unwedge myself

17:44.521 --> 17:46.648
from your doggy door
before I embarrass myself.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.111
-Just hold still.
-[Penelope yelling]

17:57.826 --> 18:00.329
Oh. It's good to see you two.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.038
All here. Not out of town.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.875
-Why would we be out of town?
-[scoffs] No reason.

18:04.958 --> 18:08.337
Just 12-year-olds who don't know anything,
they say a lot of stuff.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.632
We must not have heard you knock.
We were watching a movie.

18:11.715 --> 18:12.883
-Would you like to join us?
-No.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.010
No. Thank you.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.763
No, I just came by to bring Elena...

18:19.223 --> 18:20.391
my jacket.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.271
[softly] There you go.

18:26.855 --> 18:27.981
Okay.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.652
I'll just put it on over this jacket.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.238
Okay.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.867
I'm gonna go now. [chuckles]

18:38.951 --> 18:40.077
Yeah.

18:40.869 --> 18:44.039
Oh, just so you know,
some maniac drove over your mailbox.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.082
But they left 50 bucks,
so that seems fair, right?

18:49.378 --> 18:52.548
Guess what? Josh's parents? Home.

18:52.631 --> 18:56.302
You got fed some bad intel.
You gotta up your gossip game, son.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.387
Oh... yeah.

18:58.470 --> 19:02.558
It turns out it was Josh B's parents
who were out of town, not Josh F's.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.018
You didn't think to text me that?

19:07.062 --> 19:09.148
You know I always have my phone on me.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.150
Unplug, Penelope.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.113
Hey.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.909
-You're back early.
-Yeah.

19:20.992 --> 19:22.453
I left because I was embarrassed.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.996
Everyone was talking about my mom,
who ran over the mailbox

19:25.080 --> 19:26.290
to bring me a jacket.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.543
Sounds like you got a pretty cool mom.
[chuckles]

19:31.712 --> 19:34.298
Look, I am sorry. But we do need to talk.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.507
Oh, about what?

19:36.383 --> 19:39.261
Here. You're gonna want this.

19:44.391 --> 19:47.394
[shouts] Why does everybody think
I'm cold?

19:53.024 --> 19:54.818
-[door closes]
-What is going on?

19:54.901 --> 19:56.362
Why are you acting like a freak?

19:56.445 --> 20:00.199
Okay, Elena, I'm just gonna say it.
I know you've been looking at pornography.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.658
Oh, my God.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.703
I found it on your brother's computer.

20:05.287 --> 20:09.208
Thanks for an unnecessary yet super-fun
conversation with Alex, by the way.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.294
Sorry.

20:12.377 --> 20:15.255
I would've used my computer,
but I didn't want it to get a virus.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.844
Elena, that is... pretty smart, actually.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.430
But I still would've found out

20:23.514 --> 20:26.182
because I have that tracking software
on all your computers.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.310
-No, you don't.
-No, I don't!

20:31.730 --> 20:32.731
Okay.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.153
Obviously...

20:39.821 --> 20:41.282
you're curious about stuff.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.701
And that is completely normal.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.998
It just makes me wonder...

20:50.916 --> 20:52.584
if you're thinking about...

20:53.669 --> 20:55.921
or possibly having, you know...

20:57.464 --> 20:58.298
sex.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.055
I don't want you to feel like it's wrong.

21:05.681 --> 21:06.556
[scoffs]

21:07.308 --> 21:09.435
It's actually
a really beautiful experience

21:09.518 --> 21:12.103
that you're too young
to be having right now.

21:15.899 --> 21:16.817
But if you are...

21:17.734 --> 21:19.445
I want you to be safe...

21:22.072 --> 21:23.782
I want you to be doing it
for the right reasons,

21:23.865 --> 21:25.659
and not because you're feeling pressured.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.414
And I-- I want you to come to me.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.459
Because I didn't have that
with your  abuelita,

21:33.542 --> 21:35.210
and I want things to be different.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.754
-Mom, I'm not having sex.
-Oh, thank God!

21:40.256 --> 21:41.758
You're way too young.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.594
And guys are really bad at it
in the beginning.

21:43.677 --> 21:44.845
Not that I want you to be
with an older guy.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.805
-Mom, stop talking!
-Oh. I'm gonna stop talking.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.474
I'm gonna stop talking.

21:50.934 --> 21:51.935
[sighs]

21:52.018 --> 21:54.480
I felt like I was gonna black out there
for a second.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.274
Okay.

21:58.359 --> 21:59.818
I just, like... Oh, my...

21:59.901 --> 22:01.362
Just everything is happening so fast.

22:01.445 --> 22:03.530
You know, Josh is your first boyfriend.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.324
I know, and...

22:05.824 --> 22:07.826
-[sniffles]
-I really like him,

22:07.909 --> 22:10.829
but... I don't think I like him like that.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.122
Hey...

22:14.124 --> 22:14.958
that's okay.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.753
In fact, that's great. You know, you...

22:18.086 --> 22:21.172
you got your whole life ahead of you.
There'll be plenty of other boys.

22:22.633 --> 22:25.051
I don't think
I'll ever fall in love with a boy.

22:26.302 --> 22:27.929
[clicks tongue] Aw.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.347
[chuckles]

22:29.431 --> 22:30.849
Yeah, I get it.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.226
I've been there.

22:33.309 --> 22:36.605
But I promise you,
when you meet the right one, you'll know.

22:37.564 --> 22:39.441
What if that's not what I want?

22:40.859 --> 22:42.569
Oh, I know.

22:43.987 --> 22:47.824
Marriage is a patriarchal tool
invented to enslave women.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.576
All men are adult babies.
I know.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.454
That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about love.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.372
And I'm so happy
that we're talking like this.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.207
Because you can tell me anything.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.922
[sighs] Okay.

23:03.965 --> 23:05.592
Then what I'm trying to say...

23:06.176 --> 23:07.386
is that...

23:08.804 --> 23:10.639
when I think about love...

23:11.932 --> 23:13.266
I see myself...

23:15.227 --> 23:16.645
[sighs] someday...

23:18.313 --> 23:19.564
loving a woman.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.571
Oh.

23:29.450 --> 23:32.786
[scoffs] Why do I keep giving everyone
the wrong sex talk?

23:44.130 --> 23:45.674
When did you...

23:45.757 --> 23:47.593
[breath trembling]

23:47.676 --> 23:49.010
No. You know, you talk.

23:50.804 --> 23:53.932
It was just, I realized
that if I was going to be into a boy,

23:54.015 --> 23:55.016
it would be Josh.

23:55.100 --> 23:59.270
I mean, he's cute, and he's sweet,
and he's such a gentleman, but...

24:00.146 --> 24:02.941
I feel more when I look at
a picture of Kristen Stewart

24:03.024 --> 24:04.359
than I do when I kiss him.

24:05.026 --> 24:08.405
[sniffs] No wonder you saw
those  Twilight  movies so many times.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.075
Definitely wasn't
for the quality storytelling.

24:12.158 --> 24:13.451
[chuckles]

24:15.787 --> 24:18.331
Guess this also explains
the threesome movie.

24:18.415 --> 24:21.918
-Can we not talk about that ever again?
-Nothing would make me happier.

24:26.006 --> 24:26.882
So...

24:28.967 --> 24:30.301
Are you okay with this?

24:33.847 --> 24:34.973
Of course I am.

24:40.687 --> 24:43.356
I love you. And I want you to be happy.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.320
And you should never be afraid
to tell me anything about yourself.

24:51.364 --> 24:52.490
Thank you.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.743
I've been wanting to tell you
for a really long time.

24:55.661 --> 24:56.953
I'm glad you did.

24:58.496 --> 25:00.707
[exhales] Thank God.

25:00.791 --> 25:03.877
[inhales] It feels like this huge weight
has been lifted off my shoulders.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.296
Like... the hardest part is over.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.634
Hello, you two!

25:16.890 --> 25:18.809
Maybe not the hardest part.
