I know
we can make this work.

17:25.470 --> 17:28.838
- I don't know,
but I want to try.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.873
- I know
we can figure this out.

17:30.875 --> 17:34.577
We love each other
too much not to.

17:34.579 --> 17:35.845
- I know.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.747
Even if it means
something painful,

17:37.749 --> 17:41.751
like you giving up
your cheer captaincy.

17:41.753 --> 17:44.987
- Tamara and Sadie
had both spoken their minds,

17:44.989 --> 17:46.589
and it was time
for me to speak mine.

17:46.591 --> 17:48.858
Well, write mine out.

17:52.262 --> 17:53.562
- Hi.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.166
I'm sorry, I can't really
focus on that right now.

17:57.168 --> 17:58.901
[Whistle blows]

17:58.903 --> 18:00.836
Catch you later, okay?
I got to go.

18:00.838 --> 18:03.873
And just like that,
I was sophomore Jenna again.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.075
My worst fear had come true.

18:06.077 --> 18:08.344
I had made a huge mistake
by sleeping with Matty.

18:08.346 --> 18:10.679
I was so mad at myself,
I could scream.

18:10.681 --> 18:14.183
Well, theoretically.

18:17.654 --> 18:18.754
- Almost got it.

18:18.756 --> 18:20.189
Oh, jeez.
And--oh--

18:20.191 --> 18:21.724
- Valerie's making me
a peer mentor.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.592
Even though I didn't say
anything to these girls

18:23.594 --> 18:25.428
the whole time,
they absolutely loved me.

18:25.430 --> 18:27.730
And Sadie drives a food truck.
And she drove it on the field.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.031
And Jake and Tamara broke up.

18:29.033 --> 18:31.534
- You got to gargle with this.
Please.

18:31.536 --> 18:33.436
- [Gargles, spits]

18:33.438 --> 18:34.837
[Breathes deeply]

18:34.839 --> 18:37.440
And I have something else
to tell you.

18:37.442 --> 18:39.341
I slept with Matty.

18:39.343 --> 18:40.676
And now he's ignoring me,

18:40.678 --> 18:42.078
and he's playing
these stupid games

18:42.080 --> 18:43.512
that I thought we were past.

18:43.514 --> 18:46.882
- Honey, high school boys
can be so moody.

18:46.884 --> 18:48.284
- Well, now that I can talk,

18:48.286 --> 18:50.686
I'm gonna tell him exactly
how I feel about his mood.

18:50.688 --> 18:51.954
- No.

18:51.956 --> 18:54.290
This past day
has been fantastic,

18:54.292 --> 18:57.193
and I have never felt
closer to you.

18:57.195 --> 18:59.295
I will treasure
these mother-daughter moments

18:59.297 --> 19:00.896
we've had.

19:00.898 --> 19:02.798
- What moments?
I couldn't talk.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.301
- Right,
but you could listen.

19:05.303 --> 19:07.636
Maybe just sit tight
for a moment.

19:07.638 --> 19:09.438
Matty will talk to you
when he's ready to talk.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.906
- But I can't--

19:10.908 --> 19:13.609
- just promise me
you'll sleep on it.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.111
- Fine.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.779
- I treated myself
to a bag of pb pretzels

19:16.781 --> 19:18.981
and fell asleep watching
flash mob marriage proposals.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.416
I have a new lease on life.

19:20.418 --> 19:21.784
- I'm glad
you're feeling better.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.719
- What about you?
Any more intoxi-texting?

19:23.721 --> 19:26.589
- No, not since yesterday,
but I'm cool with it.

19:26.591 --> 19:27.823
If he wants to talk,
we'll talk.

19:27.825 --> 19:29.091
I'm not gonna push it.

19:29.093 --> 19:30.593
- Wow, look at us

19:30.595 --> 19:32.294
not letting boy drama
ruin our senior buzz.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.396
- I'm easy-breezy.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.400
But I wasn't.

19:38.402 --> 19:40.736
And before I knew it,
my mouth was open.

19:40.738 --> 19:42.505
Excuse me, Matty?

19:42.507 --> 19:45.641
- Hey, Jenna.
- Hey.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.443
Hey, well,
I'm sorry to bother you,

19:47.445 --> 19:48.811
but I know
you've been avoiding me,

19:48.813 --> 19:50.813
and I'm just wondering why.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.348
- I wasn't avoiding you.

19:52.350 --> 19:53.816
- Please don't treat me
like an idiot.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.151
We don't have to have
a big talk.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.685
I'm just wondering--
- listen, Jenna.

19:56.687 --> 19:58.621
The thing is--
- no, you listen to me, Matty.

19:58.623 --> 20:02.358
I am not gonna be
your shameful secret again.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.426
- What are you talking about?

20:04.428 --> 20:07.096
- The ignoring me.
The blowing me off.

20:07.098 --> 20:08.697
The not texting me back.
The "k."

20:08.699 --> 20:10.499
Is it because
we slept together?

20:10.501 --> 20:12.101
Pretending I don't exist

20:12.103 --> 20:14.270
is not the mature or nice way
to handle things.

20:14.272 --> 20:15.804
- This isn't about you.

20:15.806 --> 20:17.840
- Actually, it is, Matty,
because I was there too,

20:17.842 --> 20:19.708
and I have feelings too.

20:19.710 --> 20:22.011
It is about me.
It is all about me.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.980
- I'm adopted.

20:24.982 --> 20:29.518
I just found out,
and it's [Bleep].

20:29.520 --> 20:32.655
This isn't about you.

20:37.661 --> 20:38.761
- Next on <i>Awkward...</i>

20:38.763 --> 20:39.762
- What are we?
- Friends.

20:39.764 --> 20:40.996
- With benefits.

20:40.998 --> 20:43.098
- Yeah,
I guess we are.

20:43.100 --> 20:45.000
- You did break my heart.
[Girls aw]

20:45.002 --> 20:46.468
- I am not dating him,
but I have to know

20:46.470 --> 20:47.970
everything
that's going on with him.

20:47.972 --> 20:50.172
- I'm around to talk later
after school.

20:50.174 --> 20:53.108
- Yeah,
maybe I'll hit you up later.

20:53.110 --> 20:54.476
But it won't be to talk.

20:54.478 --> 20:56.278
- Oh, hey, Jenna.
- Is Matty here?
