00:02.127 --> 00:03.424
This season on Arrow...

00:03.586 --> 00:05.806
<i>Either I'm willing to do
whatever is necessary,</i>

00:05.964 --> 00:07.261
or I shouldn't be out there at all.

00:07.424 --> 00:10.598
One day, your actions might have
some unintended consequences.

00:11.929 --> 00:14.148
Prometheus, you want revenge.

00:14.473 --> 00:17.852
I'm going to show them
how everything you touch dies.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.279
He calls himself Adrian Chase.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.984
<i>He means to destroy you utterly.</i>

00:22.189 --> 00:24.362
Your crusade was based on a lie.

00:24.775 --> 00:28.996
Make it home, make it better,
right my wrongs. Survive.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.244
NO!

00:31.448 --> 00:34.793
<i>You used your father's memory
to justify a killing spree.</i>

00:35.369 --> 00:36.621
<i>I'm not going to kill you.</i>

00:36.954 --> 00:41.710
I am never going to give you
the satisfaction of being the man

00:41.875 --> 00:43.718
- that you think I am.
- You're wrong.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.345
<i>Please help me.</i>

00:45.671 --> 00:46.718
Where is my son?

00:46.964 --> 00:49.968
No! No! I said you let me go,
and I keep your loved ones safe.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.514
I'll see you on the boat.

00:51.718 --> 00:52.719
I know where he's taking them.

00:59.977 --> 01:03.106
<i>The name of the island
they found me on is Lian Yu.</i>

01:03.981 --> 01:06.325
<i>It's Mandarin for purgatory.</i>

01:16.326 --> 01:17.919
What brought you back to the island?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.085
Like I said...

01:21.832 --> 01:24.005
I need your help.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.335
What the hell's going on here?

01:25.836 --> 01:28.305
We have a problem,
and I need you to get off the island.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.382
I'm not going anywhere, neither is he.

01:30.549 --> 01:33.302
I'm taking him.
And I'm taking Digger Harkness.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.937
There's an A.R.G.U.S. supply boat
that is docked on the eastern shore,

01:36.138 --> 01:37.560
you take it and you go.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.021
I'm not abandoning my post.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.609
Suit yourself.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.696
Would you like to explain what's going on?

01:53.238 --> 01:55.491
I'd like to talk about you for a minute.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.246
- You seem...
- What, in possession of all my marbles?

02:02.039 --> 02:04.792
The Mirakuru wore off
a long time ago, kid.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.800
I mean, I remember
everything that happened,

02:09.003 --> 02:10.597
I'm not trying to escape that,

02:11.548 --> 02:13.892
but it feels like some bad dream.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.727
Now, regardless of my sanity,

02:19.306 --> 02:22.901
why do you want to help me
after everything I've done?

02:24.269 --> 02:27.990
There is a man here on the island
named Adrian Chase.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.820
He's holding my friends
and my family hostage,

02:33.904 --> 02:35.497
including Thea

02:37.699 --> 02:38.996
and my son.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.919
Since when you do you have a son?

02:41.244 --> 02:43.292
Slade, are you gonna help me or not?

02:44.289 --> 02:48.010
I think I'm stating the obvious
when I say I killed your mother.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.630
And for that alone
you should've killed me.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.009
Maybe what's happening now
is the reason I didn't.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.769
This is all the intel that I've been
able to gather on your son, Joe,

03:02.641 --> 03:04.518
including his present whereabouts.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.901
Are you offering to help me find my son?

03:08.188 --> 03:10.316
I want us to find both of our sons.

03:35.298 --> 03:39.428
You and me, kid, like old times.

03:50.731 --> 03:54.201
You know,
if we're going to fight side by side,

03:54.401 --> 03:56.278
you're going to have to
at least speak with me.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.783
I know, it's awful.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.160
Pity.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.791
By now, I thought you'd realized

04:01.992 --> 04:04.495
that by disbanding
the League of Assassins, I freed us both.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.662
Are you looking for applause?

04:05.829 --> 04:07.923
Clapping is a little more difficult
for me these days.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.675
Have you offloaded the supplies?

04:11.209 --> 04:12.882
Most. Guns and ammo
are still on the plane.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.339
By the way, what do you need an RPG for?

04:15.714 --> 04:17.341
Well, like I said,

04:18.175 --> 04:22.521
Chase has Talia, an army of her students,
Evelyn Sharp, and a meta-human.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.772
I have no interest
in this being a fair fight.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.188
Is that why you released
the animals from their cages?

04:27.350 --> 04:31.355
Oh, come on, love.
That is no way to start a new friendship.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.278
Look at me again like that,
and I'll feed you your eyes.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.700
You're not her type anyway.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.706
All right, that's enough.
Let's offload the rest of the gear...

04:47.454 --> 04:48.455
Ooh.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.206
So much for our gear.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.962
There goes our ride home, kid.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.807
Are you sure you heard the gunshot?

04:59.007 --> 05:01.009
Very sure. You sound surprised.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.224
Yeah, well, I know he would crack

05:04.262 --> 05:05.935
but I expected him to last
a little longer,

05:06.139 --> 05:08.141
it was almost disappointing.

05:16.858 --> 05:17.859
Find him.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.989
And, Gennady,

05:24.699 --> 05:26.576
no one kills him but me.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.727
- In 48 hours.
- <i>Da</i>. In two days.

06:07.576 --> 06:10.125
The RPG that took out the plane
came from over there,

06:11.371 --> 06:13.965
and the call from my son
originated just west of here.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.671
Hostages could be at either place.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.886
Or neither. This is a large island.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.510
- I'll check the RPG site.
- I'll accompany you.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.467
Oh, it's almost like
you don't trust me, Nyssa.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.727
No, it's exactly like I don't trust you.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.638
Check it out. Stay on comms.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.317
Why does he get a weapon and I don't?

06:36.646 --> 06:38.023
I trust him more than you.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.907
Didn't he kill your mother?

06:40.150 --> 06:41.618
You listen to me very carefully,

06:42.444 --> 06:44.492
you help me take down Chase, you walk.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.161
You screw with me even a little bit,

06:47.616 --> 06:49.744
and I will put you
right back into that hole.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.414
Just a gun is all I'm saying.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.127
Kid.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.091
I see movement.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.678
Stay sharp.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.390
Oliver!

07:12.766 --> 07:13.858
Keep your voice down.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.686
What the hell is he doing here?

07:17.562 --> 07:19.815
- Where is William?
- I don't know, we were separated.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.483
Oliver, what is going on?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.034
Why are they unguarded?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.036
Seems pretty obvious to me, mate.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.669
- It's a trap.
- Don't even think it, Oliver.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.418
Or your son loses his mother.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.749
Oh, and...

07:38.083 --> 07:40.085
And don't worry about that gun, mate.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.969
Mr. Chase gave me this nice new one.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.141
Along with a better offer.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.720
Adrian said it would be pointless
to reach out to you.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.565
Although, given this turn of events,
perhaps you've changed your mind?

07:53.932 --> 07:55.400
What's it gonna be, Slade?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.028
Care to side with the winners?

08:04.901 --> 08:06.073
What's it gonna be, mate?

08:10.198 --> 08:11.575
Put a gun to his head.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.961
<i>Sorry, kid,
but there's no giving up to these guys.</i>

08:19.457 --> 08:21.425
I assumed you'd wanna be
on the winning side.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.305
Assumption is the mother of all failures.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.235
Sister!

09:09.340 --> 09:12.765
Six men are dead. It's impossible!

09:15.346 --> 09:17.098
Nothing is impossible with him.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.935
Where you going?

09:20.101 --> 09:22.229
<i>Vertolet.</i> I'm gonna end this.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.617
- You okay?
- Go to hell.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.321
I'll take that as a yes.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.700
You've been left behind.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.328
You should choose your friends
more wisely.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.213
Where is everyone else?

09:41.456 --> 09:43.174
Not sure, Chase split us up into groups
when we got here.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.009
We are gonna talk about that, right?

09:45.168 --> 09:46.340
Yes, we're gonna talk about that.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.881
Right now, we need to focus
on finding the others.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.217
- Where are they?
- I wish I knew.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.928
So I could tell you
to go screw yourselves.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.517
Why did Chase split up all the hostages?

09:56.679 --> 09:58.056
Why does Chase do anything?

09:58.973 --> 10:00.975
So far, he hasn't laid out a single hoop

10:01.142 --> 10:02.860
you could keep yourself
from jumping through.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.738
Maybe leaving me here
was part of the plan.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.943
- How did Chase get you here?
- A plane.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.362
Do you think
you can find your way back to it?

10:11.528 --> 10:14.702
- Yeah, probably, but...
- Malcolm, can you fly a plane?

10:14.864 --> 10:17.367
If it's anything like
the three Gulfstreams I used to have, yes.

10:17.534 --> 10:20.083
Get them to the mainland
and then come right back for us.

10:20.245 --> 10:21.622
We are not leaving you here.

10:21.788 --> 10:25.042
I need to focus, and that means
getting you out of harm's way.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.470
And despite my better instincts,

10:28.628 --> 10:30.630
when this is all over
I will come back for you.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.595
When this is all over, you'll be dead.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.601
Can I talk to you for a sec?

10:35.760 --> 10:36.852
Yeah.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.229
- Okay, what the hell are you doing?
- What do you mean?

10:42.517 --> 10:44.565
I mean Slade Wilson and Malcolm Merlyn!

10:44.727 --> 10:47.526
- Thea, there...
- No, we are orphans because of those two.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.032
You know what I'm up against here.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.784
Yes, so why are you
sending Curtis and I away?

10:51.943 --> 10:55.914
Because I need the two of you
to keep Felicity and Samantha safe.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.916
- We need to get them off of the island.
- Okay, Curtis can handle that.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.952
I understand
if you don't wanna go with Malcolm.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.374
Damn right, I don't.

11:02.537 --> 11:05.461
And I do not want to rely on Slade Wilson.

11:07.542 --> 11:11.092
There's nothing about this situation
that's ideal, Thea.

11:11.838 --> 11:15.263
I need your help, Speedy,
and this is how you help me.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.104
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:21.890 --> 11:25.190
My sister and Harkness fled
into the forest, but I can track them.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.437
They might lead us
back to the rest of the hostages.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.530
They're our friends,
and we don't need your help.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.033
I see you haven't lost your feistiness,
Ms. Smoak.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.536
Get them to the plane,
make sure that everyone stays safe.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.991
Comms, just in case something goes wrong.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.325
You mean "when," right?

11:41.242 --> 11:44.712
Detailed satellite imagery of the island.
Again, just in case.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.632
- What was that for?
- "Just in case."

11:56.090 --> 11:57.216
We're gonna make it through this.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.931
You can't know that for sure.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.397
I didn't wanna regret not kissing you.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.810
When it comes to the two of us,
I regret enough as it is.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.941
Let's talk more about this
when we're off the island.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.577
You all keep each other safe.

12:25.370 --> 12:29.170
Nice place.
This island got a Big Belly Burger, too?

12:29.666 --> 12:33.387
Before the Chinese turned Lian Yu
into a prison, it was a holy retreat.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.805
But now you're using it for payback
for a guy you barely know,

12:36.047 --> 12:37.219
on a guy you barely know.

12:37.882 --> 12:41.432
Chase freed me.
I don't owe Oliver Queen a thing.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.565
- John!
- Hey.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.568
Hoss. You okay?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.774
- Rene.
- Okay, everyone, calm down.

12:55.358 --> 12:58.328
The four of you are gonna have
plenty of time to catch up.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.617
See you later.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.826
I'm assuming
that you tried your sonic scream.

13:05.201 --> 13:08.796
Sonic dampener. I can't even whistle.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.044
Don't worry.
Oliver will get us out of this.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.302
Yeah? What makes you think
he even knows where we are?

13:27.390 --> 13:29.267
- The trail's gone cold.
- Are you sure?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.194
No doubt my sister knew we would follow.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.448
Let me go on ahead,
see if I can recover the trail.

13:35.690 --> 13:36.737
Okay.

13:38.776 --> 13:42.952
So instead of marrying the blonde,
you marry Ra's al Ghul's daughter?

13:43.489 --> 13:45.992
Nyssa talks too much.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.162
She hasn't explained your beef with Chase.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.675
My past is coming back to haunt me.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.799
Seems to be
a recurring theme with you, kid.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.175
Don't know why.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.512
Well, it's not really that complicated.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.517
You suffer from survivor's guilt.

14:04.135 --> 14:06.012
You can't get over
the death of your father.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.645
Adrian Chase
has nothing to do with my father.

14:09.891 --> 14:13.316
Kid, when it comes to you,
everything has to do with your father.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.110
You and I are not dissimilar.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.613
We're both haunted by our pasts.

14:20.276 --> 14:24.247
And the only way you to bury that ghost
is by forgiving yourself.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.204
Forgiving myself? For what?

14:27.617 --> 14:30.461
You blame yourself
for your father's suicide,

14:31.371 --> 14:34.250
and everything else
that has gone wrong since.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.878
You need to forgive yourself
for your sins.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.467
You say that like it's easy.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.261
It is the hardest thing in this world.

14:47.053 --> 14:50.307
If the two of you are done relaxing,
I've picked up the trail.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.240
There's something I need to tell you.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.909
Can we save
the horribly awkward conversation

15:02.068 --> 15:03.115
for when we're off this island?

15:03.277 --> 15:04.870
No, that's what I need to say.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.031
When we get to the airplane,
I'm not gonna get on it.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.496
- What?
- I'm not leaving William behind.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.162
- No, Oliver will bring him back.
- I know,

15:12.328 --> 15:14.456
but I can't abandon my son.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.011
You know, for what it's worth,
I wasn't in favor of sending William away.

15:20.211 --> 15:22.134
Not that I was consulted, or...

15:22.588 --> 15:24.716
ls that why you two broke up?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.801
I'm sorry, I saw you're not wearing
your engagement ring.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.309
Yeah, no, it's just...
It was complicated, you know.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.182
I saw that kiss you gave him.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.018
Doesn't seem that complicated to me.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.695
You know, I traveled
halfway across the world to rescue you,

15:44.861 --> 15:46.704
I thought it would at least entitle me
to a conversation.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.115
Yeah? Well, it doesn't.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.500
Did it ever occur to you
that I'm here because I'm your father?

15:50.825 --> 15:53.999
No, you are not.
We are nothing to each other.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.789
Don't you ever understand that?

16:00.251 --> 16:02.299
Thea? You okay?

16:02.503 --> 16:03.720
No, she's not.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.883
She just activated a land mine.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.103
Don't move.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.487
The trigger's rusted over.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.399
Okay. That's good, right?
That's a good sign?

16:23.566 --> 16:26.661
No, that's really bad news.
It means we can't disarm it.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.496
Well, somebody needs to do something.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.123
Thea, on the count of three,
take your foot off the mine.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.329
No, that'll blow us all up!

16:32.575 --> 16:34.543
- I'm gonna take her place.
- That's crazy!

16:34.702 --> 16:35.919
Yeah, you're not the first one
to call him that.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.421
Look, I'll just find a boulder
around here or some...

16:37.622 --> 16:39.841
No, we don't have that kind of time!

16:39.999 --> 16:43.128
- Thea.
- No, okay? No one is doing this, okay?

16:43.294 --> 16:45.638
Okay, okay, it's all right.
All right.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.598
I forgot how stubborn you could be.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.934
Oh, my God!

16:53.429 --> 16:56.103
- Thank you for reminding me.
- What the hell are you doing?

16:56.599 --> 16:58.146
I'm gonna take care of them,

16:58.351 --> 16:59.944
disarm the mine,
and I'll catch up with you.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.946
- Yeah, and how are you gonna do that...
- He's not going to.

17:04.815 --> 17:08.319
No, okay? If you think that you needed
to prove something to me, you don't, okay?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.989
- You've proved it.
- I'm not trying to prove anything.

17:11.155 --> 17:15.376
From the moment you were born,
all I ever wanted was to protect you.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.878
You don't have to,
I didn't ask for you to!

17:18.119 --> 17:19.622
A child doesn't have to ask.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.883
Don't do this, okay?

17:24.085 --> 17:26.508
You may not think of me
as your father, Thea,

17:29.048 --> 17:30.971
but you'll always be my daughter.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.815
All right, go, quick!
Get her out of here. All of you, go!

17:39.058 --> 17:41.356
- No, seriously, this is insane!
- Go!

17:45.106 --> 17:47.825
- Go after the rest.
- I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.402
Oh...

17:50.987 --> 17:53.706
Well, you don't seem too bright,

17:54.365 --> 17:57.039
just standing out here
in the open like this.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.713
What kind of ass backwards strategy
is that?

18:02.290 --> 18:03.667
Let me show you.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.650
The trail continues this way.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.027
This place brings back memories?

18:27.648 --> 18:28.865
Feels like a lifetime ago.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.452
For Shado, it was.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.038
No time for nostalgia.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.532
I know where they're going.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.632
Do either of you
know anything about this place

19:26.791 --> 19:28.464
that could give us a tactical advantage?

19:28.626 --> 19:31.505
I've only seen it one time,
and that was from a distance.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.924
Well, maybe we should split up.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.101
Should we?

19:37.259 --> 19:39.432
Yeah, go on, Nyssa, we'll be fine.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.646
She doesn't trust me.

19:47.645 --> 19:48.646
Can you blame her?

19:49.146 --> 19:50.238
No.

19:59.573 --> 20:03.168
Tell Mr. Chase I have a gift for him.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.892
Oliver.

20:19.802 --> 20:23.978
Don't blame me, Mr. Wilson is the one
who gets credit for this trophy.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.980
Slade. You son of a bitch.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.441
I never should've trusted you.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.161
- Are you all right?
- Where's my son?

20:37.319 --> 20:38.821
William? Chase took him, too?

20:38.988 --> 20:41.161
We didn't know anyone else was here.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.575
Okay, what makes you think he's here?

20:43.451 --> 20:45.294
He took Samantha.

20:45.453 --> 20:46.705
He showed me a video of William.

20:47.663 --> 20:51.293
He is on this island somewhere
and we need to find him.

21:24.658 --> 21:28.003
I'd ask if you're okay,
but I don't see how you possibly could be.

21:28.162 --> 21:32.633
Honestly, I...
I don't even know how I feel right now.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.215
Twenty-four hours ago,

21:36.253 --> 21:38.722
I couldn't even think of Malcolm
without wanting to scream,

21:38.881 --> 21:41.634
and now, now I miss him?

21:42.968 --> 21:45.721
- Is that insane? I...
- It's not insane.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.723
He's your father.

21:47.890 --> 21:51.645
He manipulated me, he lied to me, he...

21:53.229 --> 21:56.779
He got me to kill my friend's sister, I...

21:57.566 --> 22:02.242
How can you miss somebody
that you have hated so much?

22:02.613 --> 22:05.958
Yeah. You know I have some experience
with evil dads, too.

22:06.992 --> 22:12.419
My father abandoned me, lied to me,
and then took a bullet for me,

22:12.581 --> 22:14.128
saving my life.

22:15.459 --> 22:19.464
Malcolm was not a good person,
and he was an even worse father,

22:19.630 --> 22:21.883
but in his own way,

22:22.049 --> 22:23.050
he loved you.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.428
Today, he proved that.

22:28.264 --> 22:32.519
God, I don't know,
it's like today I got to see

22:32.685 --> 22:34.562
the father that he could have been,

22:34.728 --> 22:38.574
but he'll never get to be

22:42.111 --> 22:43.454
because he's gone.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.203
"The plane, boss, the plane!"

22:53.372 --> 22:54.589
Reference too dated?

22:59.044 --> 23:00.387
Who's gonna fly the plane now?

23:00.588 --> 23:03.637
Oh, don't worry, between Curtis and I,
we have over 500 points of IQ,

23:03.799 --> 23:05.722
so we'll probably
be able to figure it out...

23:05.885 --> 23:07.853
- No.
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.559
No, it's not that.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.106
- Are those antennas?
- Yep.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.150
And that's C-4.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.649
This is way too many antennas
for a remote trigger.

23:19.857 --> 23:22.827
- They must be networked.
- Great, so there's more than one.

23:22.985 --> 23:25.158
Yeah, you could say that.

23:26.655 --> 23:27.998
Wait, there's hundreds.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.454
Way too many to defuse.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.173
All right, let's get out of here.

23:36.332 --> 23:38.585
I think Wilson did something to your head
when he knocked you out.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.715
Curtis worked this up for Dinah.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.004
It's gonna control your canary cry,

23:42.171 --> 23:43.969
but it's also gonna bypass
the sonic dampener.

23:44.131 --> 23:47.180
Oh, I love that Curtis!
This may hurt a bit.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.598
Just sing, Canary.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.305
Actually, it's Black Canary.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.985
The prisoners.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.865
Don't concern yourself with them.

24:07.571 --> 24:11.326
We have unfinished business, sister.

24:12.493 --> 24:15.372
I heard you gave up
the ring of the Demon's Head.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.416
What a foolish woman you've grown into.

24:19.124 --> 24:22.253
It was your selfishness
that forced me to grow up alone.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.599
Our father never would have
passed his mantle on to a woman.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.098
I had to forge my own path.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.890
And you left me,
knowing I would suffer at father's hand.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.559
And you wish to settle the score now?

24:41.313 --> 24:42.485
I stand with my friends.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.443
You ally yourself
with our father's murderer.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.237
He'd be ashamed of you.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.281
Father was always ashamed of me.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.249
No.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.253
Do not interfere.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.631
Do it.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.043
Father would have wanted you to.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.970
- You're late.
- But they are not.

25:54.678 --> 25:55.804
He was only pretending to screw with you?

25:55.971 --> 25:58.315
I needed a way
to get Curtis' device to Dinah.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.558
Have you seen my son?

25:59.725 --> 26:02.524
I've searched. Your son is not here.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.359
We gotta get my gear, and we gotta move.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.994
We find Chase, we find my son.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.947
Not so sure about that, hoss.

26:20.621 --> 26:24.000
Hello, Oliver. Welcome back to purgatory.

26:32.841 --> 26:33.888
Where's my son?

26:34.051 --> 26:35.303
I love this.

26:35.636 --> 26:38.606
Even now, at the end,
you're still ten steps behind.

26:38.806 --> 26:41.229
Where is my son?

26:41.558 --> 26:43.276
William, good name.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.647
Sort of a sweet kid, actually.
You sure he's yours?

26:45.813 --> 26:48.441
Adrian! Where is my son?

26:48.649 --> 26:51.653
If you wanna get your son back,
you know what you have to do.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.821
I know what you want me to do,

26:55.405 --> 26:56.748
and I won't do it.

26:56.907 --> 27:00.207
I'm not gonna kill you,
no matter what you do.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.171
That is never going to happen.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.458
Never say never.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.612
You said nothing ever really dies.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.491
You're going to.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.041
<i>Do svidanya, Konstantin.</i>

27:46.874 --> 27:52.131
My men overheard your conversation
with that traitor, Knyazev.

27:55.299 --> 27:58.769
The boat he's arranging will be here soon.

28:00.095 --> 28:02.644
I don't have to kill you, Oliver Queen.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.439
I only need to make sure
you never get on that boat.

29:01.031 --> 29:04.160
You thought you could replace me?

29:07.120 --> 29:08.292
That's cute.

29:11.541 --> 29:15.421
- You didn't have to do that.
- Oh, I did, for so many reasons.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.890
Oliver, do you copy?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.513
Are you sure you can't defuse these bombs?

29:20.676 --> 29:22.303
Well, I can with my equipment back
in Star City,

29:22.469 --> 29:23.561
but with this teeny-tiny, little tablet

29:23.720 --> 29:24.972
all I can do is try
and locate the trigger.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.140
- Okay, but you can try, right?
- Yeah, I can try.

29:27.474 --> 29:30.353
Okay, good, you do that. And, Curtis,
you just, you work on the comms, okay?

29:30.602 --> 29:32.275
- How?
- I don't know,

29:32.646 --> 29:34.569
you're the genius, all right?
You both are,

29:34.856 --> 29:36.199
so, we need you to do this.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.239
So you guys just gotta,
both, do this right now.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.505
There's the killer
that I know and love.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.144
Maybe you stronger
with that hood of yours.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.480
Tell me where my son is!

30:42.632 --> 30:44.100
"Pain is fascinating, isn't it?"

30:45.135 --> 30:48.264
I told you I was gonna make sure
that you were dead this time.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.897
Do it, Oliver.

30:57.064 --> 30:58.281
You know you want to.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.531
Adrian, tell me, tell me where my son is!

31:02.235 --> 31:03.236
Never.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.706
You're not gonna make that boat.

31:11.244 --> 31:16.375
This island
will remain your prison forever.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.810
It's all over, but only if you do it.

31:34.601 --> 31:39.152
Do it, Oliver, and show everyone,
show yourself who you really are.

31:44.903 --> 31:45.995
No!

31:59.835 --> 32:01.337
It's who I was.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.798
That's who I was, before!

32:06.800 --> 32:08.177
It's not who I am now.

32:10.512 --> 32:15.313
You can blame me for your father's death
for the rest of your life.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.776
Lam done blaming myself for mine.

32:22.899 --> 32:24.822
I knew it would come to this.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.704
Your son is dead, Oliver.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.649
I don't believe you

32:57.058 --> 32:58.731
because you're a liar.

33:00.520 --> 33:06.243
You're lying to me, to manipulate me
into doing what you want.

33:07.777 --> 33:12.157
But, Adrian, here's the thing,
if you are telling the truth,

33:14.576 --> 33:16.499
if you killed my son,

33:18.413 --> 33:22.714
I am never going to be
the person you want me to be.

33:25.587 --> 33:26.839
Not ever.

33:30.634 --> 33:33.228
<i>Oliver? Oliver, do you copy?</i>

33:33.553 --> 33:36.102
- Felicity.
- You can't kill Chase, did you hear me?

33:36.556 --> 33:37.557
What are you talking about?

33:37.724 --> 33:40.102
He's rigged the entire island
with explosives.

33:40.268 --> 33:42.145
They're remotely linked
to some sort of dead man's switch.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.732
If he dies, it detonates all the devices.

33:45.023 --> 33:48.277
He wants you to kill him
so it kills all of us.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.956
Oliver! Oliver, are you okay?

33:57.327 --> 33:58.749
It's okay, I'm fine.

33:59.079 --> 34:01.502
John, you need to get to the plane,
and make sure that everyone's safe.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.884
- Felicity can talk you in.
- Oliver, what the hell is going on?

34:04.125 --> 34:06.173
Chase has put explosive charges
all over the island.

34:07.003 --> 34:10.177
You need to get to the plane,
and you leave when you get there.

34:10.340 --> 34:12.717
- What are you gonna be doing?
- I'm going after my son.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.803
What if Chase is telling the truth?

34:15.637 --> 34:18.014
I don't believe him. I can't believe him.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.893
But either way, Adrian Chase
is not getting off this island.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.716
Where is William?

35:31.004 --> 35:32.005
Hmm.

36:09.250 --> 36:13.300
Where is William?

36:14.172 --> 36:15.469
You really love that kid, don't you?

36:15.632 --> 36:16.849
Adrian!

36:29.729 --> 36:33.279
For an absentee father,
your devotion is impressive.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.319
Here you are, worried about your kid

36:35.485 --> 36:36.782
when everyone else that you care about

36:36.986 --> 36:39.455
is on an island
about to get blown up sky high.

36:39.614 --> 36:43.710
My friends and my team
can take care of themselves.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.246
By using my plane to escape, right?

36:47.789 --> 36:48.915
I can't start the engine.

36:49.124 --> 36:51.001
John's right.
There is definitely something wrong.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.135
With the plane or with the pilot?
No offense.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.921
None taken. I'm no ace,

36:55.088 --> 36:57.841
but I know how to start a plane.
Whatever this was, it's not pilot error.

36:58.007 --> 37:01.807
Either way, we're not going anywhere
without Oliver, or his son.

37:02.595 --> 37:06.475
Actually, we're not going anywhere at all.
I found this ten feet from the wing.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.185
Please don't tell me
that's what I think it is.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.729
That depends on if you think
that's an on-wing hydraulic system.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.818
- Can we repair it?
- With what tools?

37:13.356 --> 37:14.733
So we're stuck here,
is that what you're saying?

37:15.024 --> 37:16.697
We have to tell Oliver. Now.

37:18.528 --> 37:19.871
Oliver, do you copy?

37:21.698 --> 37:23.541
- I'm here.
- Chase sabotaged the plane.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.701
We can't get off the island.

37:24.868 --> 37:27.121
There's an A.R.G.U.S. supply ship
on the eastern shore.

37:27.287 --> 37:28.334
That's on the other side of the island.

37:28.538 --> 37:30.165
Slade knows where it is. Go now!

37:30.331 --> 37:33.801
They'll never make it in time.
Besides, we're not finished here.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.420
Oh...

37:36.337 --> 37:39.432
Don't do that. Even if you had a shot,

37:40.216 --> 37:42.184
you've already told me
that you wouldn't kill me.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.889
Or have circumstances finally changed?

37:48.641 --> 37:52.191
If I die, everyone you care about dies.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.153
Except your son.

37:56.357 --> 38:00.032
But if you don't kill me, I kill him.

38:01.863 --> 38:03.080
You son of a bitch.

38:03.239 --> 38:06.869
William, or everyone else.

38:09.329 --> 38:12.708
You choose, right now.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.761
Either way, it proves me right, yeah?

38:17.170 --> 38:19.218
Either way, it's exactly like I told you,

38:20.548 --> 38:23.973
everyone around you,
everything you touch, dies.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.740
William! Come here! Hey, are you okay?

38:45.073 --> 38:47.246
Are you all right?
Did he hurt you? You all right?

38:47.575 --> 38:50.499
- He's gonna be fine.
- Don't you talk to him.

38:51.412 --> 38:52.789
Don't even look at him!

38:59.712 --> 39:00.713
<i>Hello?</i>

39:03.007 --> 39:05.510
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

39:06.553 --> 39:08.806
Mom, it's...

39:08.972 --> 39:09.973
It's Oliver.

39:12.684 --> 39:17.155
My son has been dead for five years.
Please don't call here again.

39:17.397 --> 39:20.367
<i>Mom, Mom, please!
Just listen to my voice.</i>

39:27.740 --> 39:28.912
It's Oliver.

39:30.118 --> 39:33.292
<i>I did not die on the Gambit,
I'm alive, I'm okay.</i>

39:34.914 --> 39:36.040
Oliver?

39:38.001 --> 39:39.253
Oliver, is that you?

39:39.419 --> 39:41.717
Yeah, Mom, it's me.
Just please don't hang up, okay?

39:41.963 --> 39:44.637
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, I won't.

39:46.342 --> 39:47.969
<i>- Oh, my beautiful boy.</i>

39:48.970 --> 39:52.224
Is... ls your father alive?

39:58.187 --> 39:59.313
No.

40:01.816 --> 40:04.410
No, he and, uh...

40:05.695 --> 40:07.072
And Sara didn't make it.

40:11.242 --> 40:16.123
Oliver, sweetheart, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.376
<i>Where are you?</i>

40:20.084 --> 40:21.085
I...

40:21.961 --> 40:27.889
I'm not entirely sure, but I'm...
I'm on a boat.

40:29.427 --> 40:34.183
I love you and I'm coming home, okay?

40:34.349 --> 40:36.977
I love you!

40:38.186 --> 40:40.234
<i>Oh, Oliver, I love you so much.</i>

40:42.941 --> 40:44.193
You won.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.991
Your son has his father back,

40:49.155 --> 40:51.704
and he learned exactly who his father was.

40:53.868 --> 40:57.873
Just like you learned who your father was,
right here.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.884
On these very same waters.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.591
- What?
- William's younger than you were,

41:05.463 --> 41:07.431
so he's gonna be fine, you know.

41:11.177 --> 41:12.770
And you have each other.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.514
What did you say?

41:14.681 --> 41:18.811
Which is good. Oliver, that's good.

41:20.353 --> 41:22.606
Because it's gonna be lonely

41:25.733 --> 41:29.738
without Mom, and Felicity.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.247
No, Adrian!

42:26.961 --> 42:27.962
