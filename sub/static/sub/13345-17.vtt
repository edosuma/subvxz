WEBVTT

00:07.741 --> 00:09.643
( types )

00:11.045 --> 00:13.214
( knocks on door )

00:29.763 --> 00:33.334
I KNOW I'M EARLY,
BUT IT'S COLD IN
THE WAITING ROOM.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.337
- CAN I COME INSIDE?
- SURE.

00:37.938 --> 00:40.074
I HAVE TO LEAVE
THIS ON.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.376
DANIEL MIGHT CALL
AND IF HE DOES,

00:42.476 --> 00:44.145
I'LL HAVE TO GO.

00:47.315 --> 00:49.617
( theme music playing )

01:08.436 --> 01:11.205
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- I'M FINE.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.776
GOOD.

01:17.245 --> 01:20.581
SO HOW DID
THE CONVERSATION GO
WITH YOUR MOTHER?

01:20.681 --> 01:23.083
I TOLD YOU I'D CALL YOU
AFTER IT WAS OVER.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.918
I DIDN'T HEAR
FROM YOU.

01:25.018 --> 01:27.255
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE CONVERSATION?

01:27.355 --> 01:28.656
NO.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.359
SHE WAS DRIVING WHEN
YOU CALLED HER, RIGHT?

01:31.459 --> 01:35.396
- RIGHT.
- DID SHE CALL YOU BACK?

01:35.496 --> 01:39.533
- DID YOU ANSWER?
- OF COURSE I ANSWERED.
DON'T I ALWAYS ANSWER?

01:41.001 --> 01:43.371
( stammers )
I COULDN'T TELL HER.

01:43.471 --> 01:47.141
- WHY NOT?
- I WASN'T IN A PLACE
WHERE I COULD TALK.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.577
OH, WHERE WERE YOU?

01:50.944 --> 01:54.382
THE LOBBY
OF SLOAN-KETTERING.

01:54.482 --> 01:57.651
I JUST WENT TO SEE
HOW IT WOULD FEEL.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.753
AND...

01:59.853 --> 02:01.955
HOW DID IT FEEL?

02:02.055 --> 02:04.692
LIKE GOING
TO A HOTEL.

02:04.792 --> 02:08.696
LIKE CHECKING
INTO ONE OF THOSE
FANCY AIRPORT HOTELS

02:08.796 --> 02:11.265
IN A CITY WHERE
NOBODY ACTUALLY LIVES.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.634
THERE WAS THIS GIRL
BEHIND THE DESK.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.269
SHE WAS LIKE MY AGE.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.772
SHE SMILED AT ME
AND SHE WAS LIKE,

02:18.872 --> 02:20.708
"CAN I HELP YOU?"

02:20.808 --> 02:23.844
AND I KNOW
THAT'S JUST SOMETHING
YOU SAY TO PEOPLE,

02:23.944 --> 02:27.581
BUT I SORT OF TOOK HER
AT FACE VALUE
IN THE MOMENT

02:27.681 --> 02:30.017
AND I WAS LIKE,

02:30.117 --> 02:32.920
"CAN SHE HELP ME?

02:33.020 --> 02:35.189
NO, PROBABLY NOT.

02:35.289 --> 02:38.158
I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO CURE CANCER."

02:38.259 --> 02:41.094
BUT STILL, SHE DEALS
WITH IT EVERY DAY.

02:41.195 --> 02:44.532
THE MINUTE
SHE LOOKED AT YOU,
SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.267
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT SHE DIDN'T--

02:46.367 --> 02:48.669
WELL, MY MOM,
SHE CALLED BACK

02:48.769 --> 02:51.405
AND I HAD TO LEAVE
TO GET RECEPTION.

02:53.707 --> 02:57.245
SHE WAS LIKE,
"WHERE ARE YOU?
YOU SOUND FUNNY."

02:57.345 --> 03:00.013
AND I WAS LIKE,

03:00.113 --> 03:03.284
"WELL, MOM, I'M--

03:03.384 --> 03:05.886
I'M ACTUALLY
A LITTLE SICK."

03:05.986 --> 03:09.657
SO SHE STARTED
TO LECTURE ME ON HOW I
DON'T TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.460
I DON'T WASH MY HANDS
WHEN I GET OFF OF THE SUBWAY

03:12.560 --> 03:15.195
AND I NEED
TO STOP BITING MY NAILS

03:15.296 --> 03:16.930
BECAUSE I'M A GROWNUP.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.734
- SHE WAS REALLY STRESSED OUT.
- WHY WAS SHE STRESSED OUT?

03:22.436 --> 03:24.872
DANIEL TRIED
TO KILL HIMSELF...

03:24.972 --> 03:26.807
AGAIN.

03:29.377 --> 03:32.012
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.014
LAST WEEK YOU SAID
HE WAS DOING BETTER.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.650
YEAH, WELL,
I SHOULD'VE REALIZED THAT
THAT WAS A WARNING SIGN.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.953
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- HE TRIED TO JUMP
OFF THE ROOF.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.393
ANYWAY, HE'S MEETING NOW
WITH ONE OF HIS OLD TEACHERS--

03:45.493 --> 03:48.862
THIS MIRACLE WORKER--

03:48.962 --> 03:50.798
MR. HEATH.

03:52.032 --> 03:56.036
HE'S THE ANNE SULLIVAN

03:56.136 --> 03:57.538
TO DANIEL'S
HELEN KELLER.

03:57.638 --> 04:00.274
HE TEACHES
AT THIS SPECIAL SCHOOL

04:00.374 --> 04:02.610
FOR AUTISTIC BOYS.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.546
MY PARENTS SENT
DANIEL THERE WHEN
HE WAS 10.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.649
THEY TOOK OUT
A SECOND MORTGAGE
TO PAY FOR IT,

04:08.749 --> 04:10.784
BECAUSE THINGS
HAD GOTTEN SO BAD.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.756
DANIEL HAD
THESE TWO BALD SPOTS

04:15.856 --> 04:18.959
ON EITHER SIDE OF HIS HEAD
FROM HITTING HIMSELF.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.295
THE HAIR JUST
STOPPED GROWING IN.

04:23.497 --> 04:27.635
AND WHAT WAS IT
THAT THIS

04:27.735 --> 04:31.071
MR. HEATH DID
FOR DANIEL?

04:31.171 --> 04:33.341
HE GOT DANIEL TO

04:33.441 --> 04:35.709
WEAR A HELMET
FOR A WHILE.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.279
AND DANIEL THOUGHT
THE HELMET

04:39.380 --> 04:41.882
GAVE HIM
SPECIAL POWERS.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.919
- HE THOUGHT IT MADE HIM--
- WHAT?

04:47.355 --> 04:49.523
IT MADE HIM
WHAT, APRIL?

04:49.623 --> 04:53.427
JUST STAY WITH THE THOUGHT.
IT MADE HIM WHAT?

04:56.063 --> 04:58.799
HE THOUGHT
IT MADE HIM SMART.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.608
ANYWAY...

05:07.708 --> 05:12.380
HE'S SUPPOSED TO CALL ME
AFTER THE MEETING'S OVER,

05:12.480 --> 05:15.416
SO I MIGHT HAVE
TO GO PICK HIM UP.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.117
WELL, CAN'T YOUR
MOTHER DO THAT?

05:17.217 --> 05:19.753
SHE-- SHE'S BUSY?

05:19.853 --> 05:22.423
NO, SHE--

05:22.523 --> 05:25.459
SHE CAN'T DEAL WITH HIM--
NOT WHEN HE'S THIS BAD.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.028
- NOT WHEN HE WANTS TO DIE.
- DID HE ACTUALLY SAY THAT?

05:28.128 --> 05:30.030
"I WANT TO DIE"?

05:30.130 --> 05:32.600
NO, HE SAYS

05:32.700 --> 05:36.870
HE WANTS
TO TURN INTO A CLOUD
AND FLOAT AWAY,

05:36.970 --> 05:39.807
BUT HE KNOWS WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM IF
HE STEPPED OFF A BUILDING.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.643
HE'S NOT STUPID.
HE JUST-- HE GETS SO TIRED

05:42.743 --> 05:45.312
OF EVERYTHING
FEELING SO STRANGE.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.748
MM-HMM.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.283
WELL, RIGHT NOW

05:50.384 --> 05:52.453
THE WORLD MUST SEEM

05:52.553 --> 05:55.589
PRETTY STRANGE
TO YOU AS WELL.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.525
YEAH.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.327
AND YOU'RE
GOING IT ALONE,

06:00.428 --> 06:03.163
WITHOUT ANY MR. HEATH

06:03.263 --> 06:05.098
TO SAVE YOU.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.968
ISN'T THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE YOUR JOB?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.803
YES, IT IS.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.239
BUT IF YOU DON'T LET ME IN,
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.442
AND THAT SCARES ME,

06:14.542 --> 06:16.610
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID
THAT IF YOU DON'T,

06:16.710 --> 06:19.379
WE'LL WASTE THE LITTLE TIME
THAT WE HAVE LEFT.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.316
JESUS.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.553
KIND OF BLUNT TODAY,
AREN'T YOU?

06:30.190 --> 06:32.292
I THINK
I'M DEPRESSED.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.628
OKAY.
TELL ME WHY.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.864
PROBABLY BECAUSE
I HAVE CANCER.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.932
RIGHT.

06:40.901 --> 06:45.072
BUT CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING?

06:46.406 --> 06:48.509
I'M NOT FEELING
ANYTHING.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.712
I'M JUST
SORT OF SICK

06:51.812 --> 06:53.013
AND TIRED

06:53.113 --> 06:56.750
AND JUST...

06:56.850 --> 06:58.886
I DON'T KNOW,
JUST KIND OF DISGUSTED

06:58.986 --> 07:00.454
WITH EVERYTHING.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.656
I'LL BE BRUSHING
MY TEETH

07:02.756 --> 07:05.158
AND I'LL LOOK
AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR

07:05.258 --> 07:09.463
AND SUDDENLY
I'LL LOOK SO UGLY,

07:09.563 --> 07:11.331
JUST AWFUL.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.134
AND BEFORE I KNOW IT

07:14.234 --> 07:15.936
I'M ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR,

07:16.036 --> 07:19.072
JUST STARTING AT THE LINT
IN THE BATH MAT

07:19.172 --> 07:21.942
AND I HAVE NO IDEA

07:22.042 --> 07:23.944
HOW I'M GOING TO GET
BACK UP AGAIN.

07:24.044 --> 07:27.748
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE DEPRESSION.

07:30.383 --> 07:33.654
IT ALSO MIGHT BE
WHAT HAPPENS

07:33.754 --> 07:36.123
WHEN YOU FEEL
THAT THINGS ARE

07:36.223 --> 07:38.926
SLIPPING OUT
OF YOUR CONTROL.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.128
IT'S HORRIBLE.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.997
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING
LIKE THAT, I WANT YOU
TO CALL ME.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.933
WHY?

07:46.033 --> 07:49.102
LISTEN TO ME.
I DON'T CARE WHAT TIME
OF THE DAY OR NIGHT IT IS,

07:49.202 --> 07:51.839
YOU CALL ME.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

07:51.939 --> 07:55.876
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO ME WHEN I'M ON
THE BATHROOM FLOOR?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.745
ANY TIME.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.850
OKAY.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.256
I SAW MY MOM
LAST WEEK

08:09.356 --> 08:11.124
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A WHILE.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.661
SHE TOOK ME
TO BRUNCH.

08:13.761 --> 08:17.965
OH. AND WHAT
DID YOU TALK ABOUT?

08:18.065 --> 08:20.067
MY BROTHER.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.204
DID SHE NOTICE HOW--

08:24.304 --> 08:26.439
HOW TIRED YOU LOOK?

08:26.540 --> 08:28.642
I PUT ON SOME MAKEUP--

08:28.742 --> 08:32.045
A LOT OF MAKEUP,
ACTUALLY.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.414
SO YOU DIDN'T
WANT HER

08:34.514 --> 08:36.617
TO NOT SEE YOU
AT YOUR BEST.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.152
I ALWAYS TRY
TO LOOK GOOD
WHEN I SEE HER.

08:39.252 --> 08:42.089
- WHY?
- IT MAKES HER
FEEL BETTER.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.024
BUT THIS LAST TIME

08:44.124 --> 08:46.459
I COULD'VE LOST
AN ARM AND SHE
WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.296
- BECAUSE OF DANIEL.
- SORT OF.

08:50.631 --> 08:54.534
ALSO SHE WANTS
TO LEAVE MY FATHER.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.470
- DID SHE TELL YOU THAT?
- YEAH.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.106
I MEAN,
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.975
SHE'S BEEN SAYING
THAT FOR AS LONG
AS I CAN REMEMBER.

09:02.075 --> 09:06.013
"LIFE WOULD BE
SO MUCH EASIER
WITHOUT YOUR FATHER.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.448
NEVER MARRY A WORKAHOLIC."
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.385
THE FUCKED UP THING
IS SHE DOESN'T ACTUALLY
WANT TO LEAVE HIM.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.254
SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT HIM.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.789
MM-HMM, SHE IS.

09:15.889 --> 09:19.359
BUT SHE SAID
SHE WANTED TO LEAVE.

09:19.459 --> 09:22.429
DO YOU THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

09:22.529 --> 09:24.231
WHAT SHE WANTS TO LEAVE

09:24.331 --> 09:26.299
IS DANIEL?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.770
YOU KNOW, I THINK
YOUR MOTHER PASSES

09:29.870 --> 09:31.772
A LOT OF HER
ANXIETY ON TO YOU.

09:31.872 --> 09:35.475
BUT I DON'T THINK
THE RELATIONSHIP
IS BALANCED,

09:35.575 --> 09:37.845
BECAUSE YOU DON'T PASS
YOUR PROBLEMS BACK TO HER.

09:37.945 --> 09:41.048
I'M SORRY
I BROUGHT HER UP. IT'S...

09:49.056 --> 09:52.025
YOU DON'T TALK
ABOUT YOUR DAD
A LOT IN HERE.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.694
I KNOW.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.997
I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH
TO SAY ABOUT HIM.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.768
HE'S NEVER AROUND.
HE'S ALWAYS AT THE HOSPITAL.

10:00.868 --> 10:04.672
FOR A WHILE
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG...

10:04.772 --> 10:07.307
DANIEL KEPT FORGETTING
WHO HE WAS.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.176
HE'D CALL HIM MISTER,

10:09.276 --> 10:11.078
LIKE, "HEY, MISTER."

10:12.445 --> 10:13.881
BUT DANIEL KEPT
GETTING WORSE

10:13.981 --> 10:15.683
AS HE GOT OLDER AND MY
DAD COULDN'T HANDLE IT

10:15.783 --> 10:18.218
- AND HE JUST CHECKED OUT.
- ON BOTH OF YOU?

10:19.519 --> 10:21.588
NO.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.390
HE AND I HAVE
OUR OWN RELATIONSHIP.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.259
I USED TO
WAIT UP FOR HIM

10:26.359 --> 10:27.828
UNTIL HE CAME HOME.

10:27.928 --> 10:31.131
I'D SIT WITH HIM
WHILE HE ATE HIS DINNER.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.701
HE'D TALK ABOUT HIS DAY,
HIS PATIENTS.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.837
SO HE TREATED YOU
LIKE AN ADULT.

10:36.937 --> 10:40.674
- IT WAS NICE.
- IT SOUNDS LIKE
HE UNDERSTANDS YOU.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.743
BUT HE DIDN'T RAISE ME.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.713
HE JUST GOT TO SWEEP IN
AT THE END OF THE DAY

10:45.813 --> 10:47.881
AND TALK
TO THE HEALTHY CHILD
FOR 15 MINUTES.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.018
SHE WAS WITH DANIEL
DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.987
DO YOU THINK PART
OF THE REASON THAT YOU
TREASURED THOSE MOMENTS

10:54.087 --> 10:58.025
WAS BECAUSE YOUR DAD WAS
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING
OTHER THAN DANIEL?

10:58.125 --> 11:01.594
- SHE NEEDS TO TALK TO SOMEONE.
- OF COURSE. I UNDERSTAND THAT,

11:01.695 --> 11:03.563
BUT WHY COULDN'T
SHE TELL A FRIEND?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.899
IT WASN'T
ANYBODY ELSE'S BUSINESS.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.468
IT'S OKAY, PAUL.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.237
I COULD HANDLE IT.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.105
I WANTED
TO HANDLE IT.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.207
SHE GETS OVERWHELMED.
SHE NEEDS TO VENT.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.778
SO AFTER SHE VENTS
AND SHE PUTS THE STRESS,
THE DISAPPOINTMENT

11:17.878 --> 11:20.147
AND THE WORRY
OF HER OWN LIFE
ON YOUR SHOULDERS,

11:20.247 --> 11:22.482
WHO DO YOU TURN TO?

11:22.582 --> 11:25.085
OR DO YOU JUST
CARRY IT WITH YOU,

11:25.185 --> 11:28.255
- YOUR BURDEN AND HERS?
- ARE WE OUT OF TIME?

11:28.355 --> 11:31.691
NO NO, WE DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THE TIME.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.495
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN--

11:35.595 --> 11:39.132
I'VE BEEN
READING UP ON AUTISM

11:39.232 --> 11:43.603
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S
SOME PRETTY PROMISING
RESEARCH COMING OUT.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.206
THERE'S NEVER
GONNA BE A CURE.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.075
YOU SEEM PRETTY CERTAIN
ABOUT THAT.

11:48.175 --> 11:51.311
IT'S NOT A DISEASE.
IF IT'S NOT A DISEASE,
THERE CAN'T BE A CURE.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.882
ACTUALLY, SOME SCIENTISTS
SEEM TO BE RECONSIDERING
THAT ASSUMPTION.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.784
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE BEING FUNDED

11:56.884 --> 11:58.886
BY RICH, DESPERATE PEOPLE.

11:58.986 --> 12:02.890
AUTISTIC CHILDREN
DON'T GET BETTER,
THEY JUST GET OLDER.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.227
I-- I'M SORRY
IF THAT SOUNDS CYNICAL.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.996
NO, IT DOESN'T.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.065
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
THOSE CHILDREN EVENTUALLY
BECOME ADULTS

12:12.165 --> 12:14.567
AND THEIR--
THEIR PARENTS DIE.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.970
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS

12:17.070 --> 12:19.406
IT FALLS ON SOMEBODY ELSE
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

12:19.506 --> 12:23.844
IN DANIEL'S CASE,
THAT WOULD BE YOU, APRIL,

12:25.145 --> 12:27.948
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.422
I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.490
WHY WOULD
YOU SAY THAT?

12:41.228 --> 12:43.730
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO DO IT.

12:43.831 --> 12:46.466
HE RUINED THEIR LIVES.
HE RUINED THEIR MARRIAGE.

12:46.566 --> 12:50.503
YOU CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T GIVE DANIEL
WHAT HE NEEDS

12:50.603 --> 12:52.339
AND HAVE ANY SPACE
FOR ANYONE ELSE.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.542
WELL, YOUR MOTHER COULDN'T,
BUT YOU'RE NOT YOUR MOTHER.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.878
YOU CAN MAKE
DIFFERENT CHOICES.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.113
SHE DIDN'T MAKE ANY CHOICES.
SHE GOT STUCK.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.449
SHE DID, APRIL.
BUT EVERY LIFE IS--

13:02.549 --> 13:04.684
IT'S A CONSTELLATION
OF CHOICES.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.087
NOBODY ESCAPES
MAKING THEM.

13:07.187 --> 13:10.157
YOU MOTHER MADE CHOICES
THAT KEPT HER LOCKED
INTO DANIEL.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.359
YOU CAN CHOOSE
DIFFERENTLY.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.762
- HE'S MY BROTHER.
- I'M NOT SUGGESTING
THAT YOU ABANDON HIM,

13:15.863 --> 13:18.966
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS
FOR EITHER OF YOU.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.201
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT SORT OF INNOVATIONS

13:21.301 --> 13:23.336
ARE GONNA COME ALONG
IN THE TREATMENT OF AUTISM.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.572
- BUT--
- YOU'RE NOT PSYCHIC, APRIL.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.407
YOU CAN'T PREDICT
THE FUTURE.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.376
YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.044
THE ONLY THING
YOU CAN DO

13:31.144 --> 13:33.914
IN RELATION
TO THE FUTURE NOW

13:34.014 --> 13:37.951
IS TO DECIDE
WHETHER OR NOT
YOU WANT TO BE IN IT.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.632
- I LOOK LIKE
SUCH SHIT RIGHT NOW.
- OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.235
WE HAVE TO START
TALKING NOW

13:55.335 --> 13:58.538
- ABOUT CHEMO.
- ( phone rings )

14:00.340 --> 14:02.075
HELLO? DANIEL?

14:02.175 --> 14:05.478
HI, DANIEL.
HOW WAS YOUR MEETING?

14:05.578 --> 14:07.380
YOU DIDN'T SEE
MR. HEATH?

14:07.480 --> 14:10.517
WHERE ARE YOU?

14:10.617 --> 14:13.386
OKAY, I'M GOING
TO CALL YOU BACK
IN JUST ONE MINUTE.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.088
WILL YOU
PICK UP THE PHONE?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.789
PROMISE?

14:16.890 --> 14:19.526
- OKAY, BYE.
- ( phone beeps )

14:25.899 --> 14:28.101
MR. HEATH.
HI, IT'S APRIL.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.171
YEAH, I KNOW.
I JUST SPOKE TO HIM.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.006
NO, HE'S FINE.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.342
HE'S IN CENTRAL PARK.
HE'S AT THE SAILBOAT POND.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.677
HE LIKES IT THERE.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.280
OKAY, BUT IF I GO
AND GET HIM RIGHT NOW

14:40.380 --> 14:42.015
COULD I STILL BRING HIM
TO SEE YOU TODAY?

14:42.115 --> 14:44.251
DO YOU STILL HAVE TIME?

14:44.351 --> 14:47.754
I'M IN BROOKLYN NOW,
SO IT'LL TAKE ME
A FEW HOURS.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.924
OKAY, THANK YOU
SO MUCH. BYE.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.260
- ( phone beeping )
- ( mutters )

14:57.430 --> 14:59.832
DAMN IT, PICK UP.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.801
COME ON, PICK UP.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.404
DANIEL. HI.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.406
I'M GONNA
COME AND MEET YOU
IN ABOUT AN HOUR,

15:06.506 --> 15:08.375
BUT I WANT YOU TO STAY
RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.178
OKAY, WILL YOU DO THAT?
WILL YOU STAY?

15:11.278 --> 15:13.446
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA SEE YOU SOON.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.249
BYE.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.953
APRIL? APRIL!

15:21.921 --> 15:24.491
OH. WHAT HAPPENED?

15:25.658 --> 15:28.128
- YOU FAINTED!
- WHAT?

15:28.228 --> 15:30.230
- NO WAY.
- YES WAY.

15:30.330 --> 15:34.067
YOU ARE SICK
AND YOU'RE NOT
TAKING CARE OF YOURSEL.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.037
SIT DOWN!
YOU NEED TO EAT.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.806
YOU NEED--
YOU NEED SUGAR
IN YOUR SYSTEM.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.408
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.810
YOU'RE NOT CALLING
THE SHOTS NOW, I AM!

15:43.910 --> 15:45.645
NOW YOU STAY THERE
AND YOU DON'T MOVE!

15:45.745 --> 15:48.448
I JUST STOOD UP
TOO QUICKLY. I HAVE
REALLY LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.418
- I'M USED TO IT.
I'M FINE. REALLY.
- DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

15:51.518 --> 15:53.987
YOU'RE TREATING ME
JUST THE WAY YOU TREAT
YOUR PARENTS.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.688
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT IT NEXT WEEK?

15:55.788 --> 15:58.125
ARE YOU SO AFRAID
THAT I WON'T BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU?

15:58.225 --> 16:01.261
- YEAH, I HAVE TO GO.
- TWO MINUTES AGO YOU WERE
PASSED OUT ON THE COUCH,

16:01.361 --> 16:03.196
NOW YOU'RE OFF
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.398
I'M NOT GOING
TO SAVE THE WORLD.
I'M GOING TO SAVE MY BROTHER.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.001
CALL YOUR MOTHER.
TELL HER TO GO GET HIM.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.602
- NO.
- WHY NOT?

16:09.702 --> 16:11.171
BECAUSE I CAN DO IT.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.041
THERE HAS TO BE
ANOTHER OPTION.

16:14.141 --> 16:17.110
YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING

16:17.210 --> 16:19.012
AND EVERYBODY
ALL THE TIME.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.014
LISTEN. IT'S OKAY
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THIS.

16:21.114 --> 16:24.184
- WHAT?
- I SAW HOW
YOU PANICKED THERE.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.354
I GET IT.
IT'S SCARY WHAT I HAVE,
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.989
YOU-- I DON'T HAVE
TO COME BACK HERE

16:30.090 --> 16:31.924
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.627
IS THAT WHAT
YOU THINK I WAS DOING?
YOU THINK I WAS PANICKING?

16:34.727 --> 16:37.630
- COME ON, YOU FREAKED.
- OKAY, LET'S SAY I FREAKED.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.600
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- THAT MEANS THAT I CAN'T
COME BACK HERE.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.403
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
HANDLE ME.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.572
IT'S POSSIBLE
TO LIVE IN A WORLD

16:45.672 --> 16:47.307
WHERE PEOPLE PANIC,

16:47.407 --> 16:49.442
WHERE PEOPLE
LET EACH OTHER DOWN,

16:49.542 --> 16:51.244
WHERE THEY DISAPPOINT
EACH OTHER

16:51.344 --> 16:53.646
BUT STILL HELP
EACH OTHER.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.583
I WILL GET SICKER
AND SICKER.

16:58.185 --> 17:01.121
I'M GONNA
KEEP PASSING OUT
ON YOUR COUCH.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.423
I'LL PROBABLY VOMIT
ON YOUR COUCH.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.992
AND THEN EVENTUALLY
I'M GONNA DIE ON YOUR COUCH.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.460
IS THAT REALLY
WHAT YOU WANT?

17:07.560 --> 17:10.363
NO! I WANT YOU TO GO
TO CHEMOTHERAPY!

17:10.463 --> 17:12.499
DO YOU--
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT CHEMO IS?!

17:12.599 --> 17:16.035
IT IS POISON
THAT THEY ADMINISTER
DIRECTLY TO YOUR HEART!

17:16.136 --> 17:20.006
THEY PUT THIS BIG PUMP
RIGHT TO YOUR HEART.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.441
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.410
BECAUSE IF THEY
JUST GAVE YOU A SHOT

17:23.510 --> 17:25.345
AND SOME OF IT GOT
UNDER YOUR SKIN,

17:25.445 --> 17:27.480
IT WOULD MELT
YOUR FUCKING FLESH!

17:27.580 --> 17:30.217
- THAT IS NOT
GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU!
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.519
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.288
YOU CAN'T STOP WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.458
THE-- THE--
THE NAUSEA

17:38.558 --> 17:40.860
AND THE PAIN,

17:40.960 --> 17:42.362
MY HAIR.

17:42.462 --> 17:46.799
YOU'LL-- YOU'LL TELL ME
THAT LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL

17:46.899 --> 17:48.335
AND I HAVE TO BE BRAVE

17:48.435 --> 17:50.703
AND I'LL SAY,
"YES YES YES,"
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

17:50.803 --> 17:54.407
BUT I'LL BE LYING
AND YOU KNOW THAT
I'LL BE LYING.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.910
AND ONE MORNING
YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP

17:58.010 --> 18:01.080
AND SAY TO YOURSELF,

18:02.014 --> 18:04.517
"I JUST WISH

18:04.617 --> 18:06.819
THAT FUCKING GIRL--

18:06.919 --> 18:09.689
I JUST WISH
THAT FUCKING GIRL
WOULD LEAVE ME ALONE

18:09.789 --> 18:12.559
SO I CAN BE HAPPY AGAIN."
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO HANDLE IT.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.362
YOU WON'T.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.831
SO TO HELP SOMEONE IS--

18:18.931 --> 18:21.268
( clears throat )
IS TORTURE.

18:21.368 --> 18:24.404
IT'S UNBELIEVABLY PAINFUL.
IT'S HELL.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.239
YEAH?

18:26.339 --> 18:28.275
IF YOU LET ME HELP YOU,

18:28.375 --> 18:30.943
I WILL HATE YOU FOR IT.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.045
YEAH?

18:33.146 --> 18:36.749
AND I'LL--
I'LL PROBABLY
FAIL YOU ANYWAY.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.252
YEAH?

18:42.255 --> 18:44.424
( cell phone ringing )

18:56.002 --> 18:57.704
HI, MOM.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.575
UH, NO, HE DIDN'T.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.979
I-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.848
HE'S IN CENTRAL PARK.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.017
I WAS--

19:11.117 --> 19:13.420
I WAS GONNA GO
AND GET HIM,

19:13.520 --> 19:15.788
BUT I GOT STUCK
SOMEWHERE.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.727
WELL, I'M IN BROOKLYN NOW.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.762
COULD YOU GO GET HIM?

19:24.231 --> 19:27.099
UM, BECAUSE I CAN'T LEAVE.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.337
NO, I CAN'T.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.772
I CAN'T.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.843
I CA--
I CAN'T, MO--

19:36.943 --> 19:39.212
( beeps )

19:39.312 --> 19:41.814
SHE--
SHE HUNG UP.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.321
OUR TIME IS UP.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.257
CAN YOU WAIT A MINUTE?
JUST SIT DOWN FOR A MINUTE.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.891
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANOTHER PATIENT?

19:51.991 --> 19:54.594
NO NO NO, I WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING
TO YOU. SIT DOWN.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.995
LISTEN.

19:56.095 --> 19:59.266
IF WE HAD MORE TIME,

19:59.366 --> 20:03.236
WE COULD FIND A WAY
TO TELL YOUR MOTHER AND SEE
IF SHE COULD HANDLE IT.

20:03.336 --> 20:06.406
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.941
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.978
AND, APRIL, I'M NOT GOING
TO SIT HERE WEEK AFTER WEEK

20:12.078 --> 20:13.813
AND WATCH YOU
JUST SLIP AWAY.

20:13.913 --> 20:18.217
WE HAVE TO BEGIN
TREATMENT TODAY, NOW.

20:18.318 --> 20:21.053
I TRIED.
I TOLD YOU
I WENT THERE.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.490
- I COULDN'T DO IT.
- LAST WEEK YOU SAID

20:23.590 --> 20:25.925
THAT THE THINGS WE
DISCUSS IN THIS ROOM
MAKE SENSE

20:26.025 --> 20:28.961
WHILE YOU'RE HERE,
AND THEN WHEN YOU LEAVE
EVERYTHING CHANGES.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.530
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

20:30.630 --> 20:33.366
WHAT IS IT
ABOUT THIS ROOM

20:33.466 --> 20:36.636
THAT MAKES
THINGS SEEM...

20:36.736 --> 20:38.605
DIFFERENT?

20:41.374 --> 20:43.576
I DON'T KNOW.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.745
THE ISOLATION,

20:45.845 --> 20:47.647
THE DETACHMENT.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.988
YOU.

21:02.228 --> 21:05.264
WHAT IF I COME WITH YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL?

21:08.134 --> 21:09.769
WOULD YOU?

21:09.869 --> 21:11.671
YES.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.675
NOW?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.610
YES.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.846
RIGHT NOW.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.414
( outer door shuts )

21:54.514 --> 21:56.983
( theme music playing )
