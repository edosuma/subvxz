WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:03.135
...and you clearly didn't trust me
to make the right decision.

00:03.400 --> 00:04.135
I was worried about you.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.335
You don't have to be worried
about me! I'm not a child.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.015
Can I help you?

00:08.960 --> 00:09.695
He doesn't know?

00:09.920 --> 00:10.615
It's my son.

00:10.840 --> 00:13.015
He is everything to me.
You understand?

00:14.160 --> 00:16.375
Elise, I found him.
I found Saban. He's alive...

00:21.920 --> 00:23.735
Dad...When you were
in charge of the case...

00:24.080 --> 00:25.975
...why did you ask me to
exclude the hotel L'Ã‰crin...

00:26.680 --> 00:27.775
...from the Charlie
Moreau investigation?

00:28.040 --> 00:29.215
I had an informant there.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.855
We got eleven missing person reports
in the last twenty four hours...

00:33.200 --> 00:33.895
...all from Folkestone.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.815
The last one is a delivery driver.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.335
He was driving a meat truck.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

02:52.200 --> 02:53.055
It's show time.

05:18.800 --> 05:19.415
Elise?

06:06.080 --> 06:07.135
Please don't come any closer, Karl.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.375
Stop. Please?

06:31.600 --> 06:32.375
Answer it.

06:36.680 --> 06:37.255
Hello?

06:40.560 --> 06:41.255
Hello?

06:43.480 --> 06:44.535
Lana, is that you?

06:46.480 --> 06:47.215
Can you hear me?

06:50.720 --> 06:52.095
Lana I have news for you.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.335
I have found Saban.

07:11.920 --> 07:12.855
Lana?

07:13.280 --> 07:13.935
Hello?

07:15.320 --> 07:15.935
Are you there?

07:18.120 --> 07:20.695
This is my time
to talk, DCI Roebuck.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.095
Hello Anton.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.215
The grumbling grew to a
mighty rumbling; And out of the...

07:33.240 --> 07:35.615
...houses the rats came tumbling.

07:37.800 --> 07:38.575
Can you see it?

07:56.800 --> 07:57.735
Pick it up.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.415
Do whatever they ask.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.375
Okay, I have it.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.775
The truck inside the tunnel
is filling with hydrogen sulphide.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.495
The people inside really
don't have long to live.

08:43.919 --> 08:44.735
Press that button...

08:44.960 --> 08:47.615
...the doors of the meat
truck will automatically open...

08:48.360 --> 08:49.575
...and those innocent
people will be free...

08:51.200 --> 08:52.775
...but your friend's necklace
will detonate.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.335
You have to decide
which is worth more...

09:01.760 --> 09:03.695
...her life or the lives
of those strangers.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.015
But Anton, listen to me...

09:12.240 --> 09:13.695
...you don't have to do any of this.

09:15.480 --> 09:16.095
Do you hear me?

09:17.400 --> 09:18.055
Anton?

09:19.040 --> 09:20.615
If I were you I'd hurry
up and make your choice.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.415
What did he say?

09:34.000 --> 09:34.615
Okay...

09:36.960 --> 09:40.975
Elise, what do we know?
What have you seen? Where are they?

09:42.840 --> 09:44.375
I don't know.
I heard them drive away.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.415
Right.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.095
There are eleven people in there.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.135
I think they're being gassed.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.055
Yeah.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.655
We need to get that contraption
off you. Is it live, do you think?

09:57.600 --> 09:58.615
I can hear it ticking.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.895
I...I can't see.
I don't know how long is left.

10:04.920 --> 10:05.575
Okay.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.815
Where the fuck are you Roebuck?

10:09.720 --> 10:12.455
I'm at the abandoned tunnel
in the cliff at Samphire Hoe.

10:12.800 --> 10:19.255
The co-ordinates are 51.1040
degrees North, 1.2705 degrees East.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.295
I need to get bomb
disposal squad here immediately.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.775
Elise Wassermann is
wearing a locked collar bomb.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.815
Also, the meat truck is here.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.775
There are eleven people inside.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.575
They're being slowly positioned
with hydrogen sulphate gas.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.095
They will die unless
I detonate the bomb.

10:38.560 --> 10:39.575
I'm supposed to choose.

10:41.680 --> 10:42.735
Mobilize bomb disposal.

10:45.080 --> 10:45.975
Hello?

10:47.480 --> 10:47.975
Hello?

10:48.440 --> 10:49.455
Yeah I'm still here.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.135
We're heading there now.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.095
Bomb squad will move in behind
you, but until they get there...

10:54.320 --> 10:55.375
...we can't intervene.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.095
How long will they be?

11:00.080 --> 11:00.815
Hello?

11:01.120 --> 11:01.815
How long will they take?

11:05.680 --> 11:06.815
We'll get there as quick as we can.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.415
He calls again.
Keep him talking.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.775
Yeah, right okay.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.615
He doesn't seem to be in
much of a mood for chatting...

11:15.840 --> 11:16.975
...but I'll...I'll
tell him a couple...

11:17.000 --> 11:18.175
...of jokes. See if that
warms him up a bit.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.095
Thank you.
Bye.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.495
Well what do you think?
You've been in touch with Anton.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.615
More of a, what...

11:38.200 --> 11:40.535
...anecdote sort of fella or a...

11:42.200 --> 11:43.295
...a knock-knock man?

11:44.960 --> 11:46.015
It's okay. You can...

11:47.680 --> 11:49.495
...skip the section
on establishing a rapport?

11:53.800 --> 11:54.935
You already have my trust.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.335
Do I?
I thought I'd lost it.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.455
I thought we could
express our anger...

12:03.680 --> 12:05.055
...with each other without
damaging our friendship.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.015
You're so hard to help.

12:13.640 --> 12:14.575
I'm sorry.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.175
I... I, I erm...

12:20.040 --> 12:21.335
Sorry if I did it wrong.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.855
Hello?
Anton.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.535
Time is ticking detective...

12:35.800 --> 12:37.335
Are you going
to press that button...

12:37.360 --> 12:38.655
...and save those poor
innocent people?

12:39.080 --> 12:41.535
Anton. You have to listen to me.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.695
I was wrong.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.015
Saban is not dead.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.535
I was deceived.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.015
Please tell Lana.
I can bring Saban here.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.335
Hydrogen sulphide smells...

12:56.080 --> 12:57.535
...like rotten eggs at first.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.775
Then you start to lose
your sense of smell.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.775
You think the gas has gone.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.855
Just when you think
you'll be okay...

13:09.160 --> 13:10.615
...asphyxiation starts.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.575
Listen to me.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.495
This is over.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.135
I've found Saban. Isn't
that what this was all about?

13:21.720 --> 13:22.335
Please!

13:23.440 --> 13:25.055
Please!
Let me speak to Lana.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.895
Lana isn't interested
in what you've got to say.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.575
You speak to me and only me.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.695
Do you know what it's like to live
your whole life without love?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.775
She made me feel again.
But you got between us.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.575
Well I'm sorry about that.
Truly I'm sorry.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.975
Tell me how I can fix this?

13:48.640 --> 13:50.295
What, what is it
that you want, Anton?

13:51.280 --> 13:52.655
I can't have what I want.

13:54.040 --> 13:54.855
It's too late.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.135
So what I want now is for you
to make your choice.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.495
A truck full of strangers.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.215
Or your friend.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.415
You have maybe, five minutes left.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.735
Then they suffocate.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.015
What's going on?

14:39.280 --> 14:40.415
There truck's filling with...

14:40.440 --> 14:42.055
...poisonous gas. They
want me to choose.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.375
What gag?

14:51.560 --> 14:52.575
Hydrogen sulphide.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.375
You've got to do it Karl.

15:41.840 --> 15:45.055
You can't make me
responsible for all those deaths?

15:46.280 --> 15:47.335
It has to be about numbers.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.215
I can't.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.815
If you press it me.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.095
It's just one life.

16:04.720 --> 16:05.655
And you can save them.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.215
Karl, you need to do it.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.335
There's no choice.

16:12.280 --> 16:13.375
Fucking help me!

16:19.480 --> 16:21.015
You need to press that button.

16:26.200 --> 16:26.855
I can't.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.335
Don't carry this with you.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.615
It's my choice.

16:36.840 --> 16:37.695
It's not theirs.

16:37.960 --> 16:38.975
It's not yours.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.055
Get justice for Charlie Moreau?

16:43.360 --> 16:43.735
Elise!

16:43.960 --> 16:44.935
And thank you for being my friend.

16:45.120 --> 16:45.655
No!

18:24.360 --> 18:25.095
Elise?

18:29.760 --> 18:30.455
Elise?

19:04.760 --> 19:05.775
Excuse me?

19:12.480 --> 19:13.575
I've lost my friend.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.375
Hello.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.615
I've lost Elise.
- You need to come with me.

19:22.240 --> 19:25.740
Thank you.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.575
Suspects sighted
in a stolen vehicle.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.335
I repeat, suspects
sighted in a stolen vehicle.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.095
It looks like
they're heading under...

20:13.120 --> 20:14.495
...the A20 bridge on
Abbot's Cliff Road.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.175
Aerial unit in pursuit.
Ground unit talk back.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.895
Suspects may still be
in possession of explosives.

20:22.080 --> 20:22.935
Police! Police!

20:23.240 --> 20:24.415
I just have to get
something from the car.

20:29.920 --> 20:33.055
No stop! Karl! You shouldn't
be driving in this state. Come on!

21:19.120 --> 21:20.495
Boss, they're heading towards...

21:20.520 --> 21:22.095
...the cliffs. DCI
Roebuck's in pursuit.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.735
I think they're
planning a Thelma and Louise.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.135
Shit.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.375
Fuck!

22:38.760 --> 22:39.535
Are you ready?

22:40.000 --> 22:40.775
I'm ready.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.735
Don't come any
closer or I'll shoot you.

23:41.640 --> 23:42.615
You killed Elise.

23:46.480 --> 23:49.735
I offered you your
son and you killed Elise.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.415
My son is dead.
- No, he's not.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.375
I told him to put you on the phone.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.455
Saban is alive.

23:55.720 --> 23:56.975
You're lying.
All you do is lie.

23:57.240 --> 23:57.895
I've seen him.

23:58.880 --> 23:59.735
Do you want to see a photo of him?

23:59.960 --> 24:01.695
No. I don't want to see this.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.615
He was adopted by a French couple.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.735
There! That's your son.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.015
He's lying!

24:09.840 --> 24:10.575
That's your son!

24:12.120 --> 24:13.855
Is name is Francois.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.975
He's happy.
He's getting married.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.375
I trusted you.

24:28.920 --> 24:29.535
No!

24:35.520 --> 24:36.895
Jesus fucking Christ.

24:39.560 --> 24:40.415
Put the gun down.

24:40.600 --> 24:44.655
Tell Saban I loved him
every day of my life.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.295
How dare you!

24:47.000 --> 24:47.775
How dare you!

24:49.760 --> 24:51.935
I'd do anything to have one day...

24:52.560 --> 24:56.215
...one minute with my son.

24:56.440 --> 24:57.735
Just to see his face.

25:00.720 --> 25:01.895
Just to tell him I loved him.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.215
You can have that minute.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.335
You can have it.
You can hold him in your arms.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.175
Police! Stay where you are!

25:30.080 --> 25:31.215
Stay where you are!
Don't move!

26:26.720 --> 26:27.975
Louise, Philippe...

26:29.080 --> 26:29.935
Would you come with me, please?

28:24.200 --> 28:25.655
Hello.
- Hello.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.175
Evelyne Chapelle.

29:20.840 --> 29:21.895
Terry Heaney.

29:27.480 --> 29:28.735
Lawrence Taylor.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.175
Father Francis Paine.

29:48.440 --> 29:49.415
Shirley Souness.

29:54.080 --> 29:54.815
Anton Stokes.

30:21.720 --> 30:22.415
Look at them.

30:24.760 --> 30:26.375
When can I see my son?
- Look at them.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.295
I was singing Saban to sleep...

30:52.520 --> 30:54.055
...when the soldiers came.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.335
Afterwards...

30:56.840 --> 30:58.495
...there were piles of bodies...

30:58.720 --> 30:59.775
...like rag dolls.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.695
We were not people to them.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.935
We were animals to be slaughtered.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.215
When you have
survived such things...

31:09.480 --> 31:10.455
...killing is nothing.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.095
I'll leave the photos with you.

31:19.320 --> 31:20.535
You'll have some time on your hands.

31:20.960 --> 31:21.815
<i>Where's m'; â€œY?</i>

31:23.440 --> 31:24.095
Now.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.255
You gave me a choice.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.935
Between killing my friend,
who I loved...

31:31.120 --> 31:35.455
...and killing eleven random,
innocent people that you abducted.

31:35.880 --> 31:36.935
I couldn't make that choice.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.175
Now I have another one.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.615
Do we let Saban...

31:42.040 --> 31:43.295
...get married, get
on with his life...

31:43.560 --> 31:44.655
...like anybody else.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.575
Or we tell him who is mother is...

31:48.240 --> 31:50.295
...and what she's done
in his name.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.335
I'll leave you with that.

32:37.920 --> 32:38.495
Karl...

32:43.000 --> 32:45.375
I am glad it was you with her.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.415
So...

33:15.640 --> 33:17.175
...let's honour her last request.

33:18.560 --> 33:19.375
What have you got?

33:22.080 --> 33:22.935
The day...

33:23.200 --> 33:24.495
...the day Charlie was taken...

33:25.120 --> 33:26.655
...there was a room
at the Hotel L'Ã‰crin...

33:26.800 --> 33:28.935
...occupied by this man
- Laurent Morel.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.135
He's a convicted sex offender...

33:32.360 --> 33:33.895
...and part of a
larger paedophile ring.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.775
And we're pretty sure
from Charlie's statements...

33:37.000 --> 33:39.455
...and his memories
from the Baie de Somme...

33:39.840 --> 33:41.815
...that Laurent Morel
was the one...

33:42.080 --> 33:42.935
...who took him.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.895
Astor Chaput was in charge
of sourcing witnesses...

33:47.960 --> 33:50.415
...but there was not a
single one from the Hotel L'Ã‰crin.

33:52.680 --> 33:55.095
I've just found Laurent
Morel's last known address.

33:56.960 --> 33:57.695
Let's go.

34:09.320 --> 34:11.935
Elise saw right
through you, didn't she?

34:13.600 --> 34:14.775
Are you protecting someone?

34:15.880 --> 34:17.335
You need to ask
yourself if they're worth...

34:17.520 --> 34:18.775
...throwing everything away for.

34:47.440 --> 34:48.215
Yes?

34:50.159 --> 34:51.255
Laurent was my uncle.

34:51.679 --> 34:52.614
He was bedridden.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.855
When the house caught
fire he couldn't escape.

34:55.920 --> 34:56.695
He was burned alive.

35:00.680 --> 35:01.855
The refurbishment
is only just finished.

35:02.360 --> 35:03.855
I'm sorting the
last of his papers...

35:04.120 --> 35:05.135
...before the house
goes on the market.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.735
What did you want with him?

35:08.960 --> 35:10.095
We think he was involved...

35:10.320 --> 35:11.935
...in the abduction of a child...

35:12.200 --> 35:13.615
...at the Baie de Somme
eight years ago.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.375
The Charlie Moreau case,
you may remember it.

35:17.440 --> 35:18.575
My uncle loved kids.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.015
He would never harm them.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.135
Your uncle was a
convicted paedophile.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.775
That was a misunderstanding.
- I don't think so.

35:29.720 --> 35:30.455
Shall we look around?

35:35.360 --> 35:36.655
If Charlie was kept here...

35:36.920 --> 35:37.975
...any evidence will be gone.

35:46.920 --> 35:47.815
It's over, Dad.

35:49.960 --> 35:52.415
Olivier Pujol knows
who took Charlie Moreau.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.055
A paedophile called Laurent Morel.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.975
Now you have
someone to prosecute...

36:02.520 --> 36:04.895
...perhaps the case can be closed.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.855
You ordered me to leave the
hotel out of the investigation. Why?

36:10.480 --> 36:11.615
There was no informant.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.335
Only a ring of paedophiles...

36:16.560 --> 36:18.055
...who came and
went as they pleased.

36:22.920 --> 36:23.935
Tell me you're not one of them.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.975
Morel and his friends
paid me to turn a blind eye.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.575
They used it to...

36:39.200 --> 36:40.815
Socialise?

36:42.880 --> 36:44.295
You mean, to rape children?

36:45.960 --> 36:47.575
They offered me money
and I took it.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.575
When I realised
they were involved...

36:51.880 --> 36:53.175
...in the Moreau
boy's disappearance...

36:54.280 --> 36:55.135
...I stopped it.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.135
Why didn't you arrest them?

36:58.520 --> 36:59.415
You could have found Charlie.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.135
Because I thought he was dead.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.855
Like everyone did.
- Right...

37:07.080 --> 37:08.895
It wasn't because you knew
we'd investigate the hotel...

37:09.160 --> 37:10.975
...and discover
your little arrangement.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.455
In this job, we see the
worst aspects of human nature.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.135
It's naive to think you can
save every victim.

37:20.720 --> 37:23.535
The best you can do is
protect your little patch.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.215
That's what I did.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.695
You followed my
order without question.

37:30.680 --> 37:31.655
No, I...
- Wait.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.175
You're just as guilty as I am.

37:41.480 --> 37:42.575
Monsieur Josef Chaput...

37:44.000 --> 37:45.255
...I am arresting
you for corruption,

37:45.320 --> 37:46.615
...and for perverting
the course of justice.

38:04.080 --> 38:05.775
There are too few
good men in this job.

38:08.120 --> 38:08.895
You are one of them.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.255
What do you think I
should do about Saban?

39:04.840 --> 39:05.935
You want to tell him the truth?

39:07.280 --> 39:09.495
Isn't it every
child's right to know?

39:09.960 --> 39:11.095
Not in France.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.175
Once a child is adopted...

39:14.400 --> 39:16.655
...it's the parents' choice
to tell or not.

39:17.560 --> 39:20.455
The state doesn't
interfere with parenting.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.375
Another great gulf
between our nations!

39:28.840 --> 39:30.015
What would Elise do?

39:35.360 --> 39:36.375
Tell the truth.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.255
She wasn't always right.

39:56.080 --> 39:56.815
Good morning.

39:57.720 --> 39:58.775
Good morning, sir.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.135
It's a new identity for FranÃ§ois.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.535
With you and your wife...

40:11.880 --> 40:17.655
It's erm... parents...
...biological.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.255
He's yours.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.335
But I...

40:32.960 --> 40:34.135
I don't know what to say.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.415
I don't know how to thank you.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.655
Could you do something for me?

41:18.480 --> 41:21.415
Security approved these but I
wanted to give them to you myself.

42:52.960 --> 42:55.415
I'll take Maya back home.
Give you some space.

42:58.440 --> 42:59.655
Don't think I need space.

43:01.560 --> 43:02.575
What can I do?

43:06.160 --> 43:07.055
I don't know.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.375
I miss you.

43:20.760 --> 43:21.815
I miss all of you.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.055
What are we going to do about that?

43:31.360 --> 43:32.095
Dunno.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.975
Life is too short not to grab...

44:15.120 --> 44:16.335
...what makes you happy
while you can.

44:20.960 --> 44:23.135
Would you like
to stay with me tonight...

44:24.080 --> 44:27.735
...and we can do more
of what makes you happy?

44:29.440 --> 44:30.535
How come?

44:31.560 --> 44:32.495
Duo Lingo.

44:35.120 --> 44:38.455
I hope this doesn't mean we'll
spend the whole night talking?

45:03.840 --> 45:07.215
How do you say no chance?

47:23.880 --> 47:24.815
He's lively.

47:43.880 --> 47:44.935
Hello!

47:52.920 --> 47:53.735
Hi!

47:54.280 --> 47:55.775
Hey, how you doing?

47:55.960 --> 47:57.055
Alright and you?

47:57.240 --> 47:58.135
Yeah good.

48:02.920 --> 48:03.615
Look Dad's here!

48:04.680 --> 48:05.655
Daddy!

48:36.640 --> 48:37.455
Billy?

48:38.720 --> 48:39.775
Maya?
Hannah?

48:45.600 --> 48:48.215
Help! Come and find me!

48:49.640 --> 48:50.455
Help!

48:57.760 --> 48:59.735
I'm lost! Maya!
