WEBVTT

00:00.393 --> 00:01.494
Please start from the beginning.

00:01.518 --> 00:03.644
I created an app and
put it up for download.

00:03.789 --> 00:06.207
It targets my ex-employer.

00:06.255 --> 00:07.688
Your request is denied.

00:07.713 --> 00:09.596
Your client must comply immediately.

00:09.621 --> 00:11.722
I'm the only one who knows
how to take down this app,

00:11.747 --> 00:12.879
and I'm not gonna do it.

00:12.904 --> 00:16.798
But you should know that that issue
in Millwood, I've been cleared.

00:16.885 --> 00:18.900
They're dropping
the charges against David.

00:19.001 --> 00:21.603
Guys like David get off with nothing!

00:21.704 --> 00:24.648
- He's gonna get what's coming to him.
- Get this letter to Taylor.

00:24.681 --> 00:26.647
- I don't know where she is.
- Yes, you do.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.138
He asked me to give this to you,

00:28.163 --> 00:29.748
but I can't make you read it.

00:29.773 --> 00:31.016
I'm just heading home.

00:31.041 --> 00:33.121
We'll walk with you.
That's why Bear Clan's out here.

00:33.764 --> 00:35.033
Hey, brother!

00:35.058 --> 00:36.462
- Shane.
- I'm back.

00:36.487 --> 00:38.372
Those lawyers today,
they were from Lovand.

00:38.397 --> 00:39.796
Let's just dump all
this on the sidewalk,

00:39.820 --> 00:40.994
and pretend we never got this case.

00:41.018 --> 00:43.186
We're his lawyers.
Once we say we're in, we're in.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.346
They'll kill anyone
who learns about their secret.

00:45.523 --> 00:48.035
Me and now you.

00:51.469 --> 00:54.482
Drop the case. You have been warned.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.911 --> 01:09.704
- What took you so long?
- I got here as soon as I could.

01:09.729 --> 01:11.342
What are you doing, man?

01:11.367 --> 01:13.174
I'm protecting myself, which is
what you should be doing too.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.766
- I'm not gonna get a gun!
- I'm not taking any chances!

01:15.867 --> 01:18.441
Dude, come on.

01:18.466 --> 01:19.973
- I can't do this anymore!
- Come on, man!

01:19.997 --> 01:22.492
No! OK? I'm out!

01:22.579 --> 01:26.315
- You need to try and calm down.
- Calm down?

01:27.838 --> 01:31.233
They're destroying my life, Noah.

01:32.271 --> 01:34.310
I know, I know,

01:34.412 --> 01:37.882
but we are going to get
through this together.

01:38.549 --> 01:40.216
You just gotta do me a favour.

01:40.317 --> 01:43.086
Put that down, man.
You are freaking me out.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.173
Thank you.

01:52.496 --> 01:53.863
Look...

01:56.400 --> 01:57.798
I need you.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.245
The movement needs you.

01:59.270 --> 02:01.543
- Screw the movement!
- No. No.

02:01.568 --> 02:03.657
The only reason that they're
playing dirty is because

02:03.682 --> 02:06.676
we have them on the ropes.
The app is up and it's working.

02:06.777 --> 02:09.112
We need to finish what we started.

02:10.017 --> 02:11.657
"Whatever it takes,"

02:12.379 --> 02:14.117
remember?

02:18.723 --> 02:20.857
You're right.

02:22.965 --> 02:24.260
Yeah?

02:24.819 --> 02:26.700
Whatever it takes.

02:26.867 --> 02:28.380
Yes. OK.

02:28.405 --> 02:31.608
That is what I like to hear, man.

02:32.393 --> 02:35.238
Look, I-I-I gotta go now but, um...

02:35.447 --> 02:37.607
we got this, OK?

03:52.862 --> 03:54.384
So someone broke into your car?

03:54.409 --> 03:57.106
- While I was still driving it.
- So, like a carjacking?

03:57.221 --> 03:59.549
Not exactly. They were not in the car;

03:59.574 --> 04:01.758
They gained control of it remotely.

04:02.011 --> 04:04.197
I was still behind the wheel,
but I was powerless.

04:04.267 --> 04:05.711
That must have been terrifying.

04:05.793 --> 04:09.833
And then they threatened me
through my In-Car system.

04:10.278 --> 04:12.635
I know how crazy I must sound.

04:12.736 --> 04:13.840
I don't think that.

04:13.894 --> 04:16.697
What you're reporting
here is a serious offence.

04:17.301 --> 04:20.134
The threat, what was said exactly?

04:23.540 --> 04:27.150
I can't tell you that. It'd be
breaking client privilege.

04:27.251 --> 04:29.386
So this is connected to a case?

04:29.552 --> 04:31.654
- What can you tell me about it?
- I can't.

04:32.192 --> 04:34.090
So you know who did this?

04:34.191 --> 04:36.222
I can't. I'm sorry, this was obviously

04:36.247 --> 04:38.229
- a mistake. I'm sorry.
- No, if you were threatened,

04:38.253 --> 04:41.397
you need to file a report.
Just hold on, OK?

04:41.498 --> 04:44.410
I'll give you my card.
When you're ready to contact...

04:59.984 --> 05:02.552
Captain, my Captain?

05:02.653 --> 05:05.740
I made coffee.
I hope it's not too strong.

05:06.717 --> 05:08.851
- How did you sleep?
- I didn't.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.211
Country air, sound of the river...

05:11.321 --> 05:13.712
it's more like being in a coma.

05:14.518 --> 05:17.754
- You hate my coffee?
- I haven't even tried it yet.

05:18.035 --> 05:20.470
Try it.

05:26.117 --> 05:29.103
- It's not coffee, it's beer.
- Not just any beer.

05:29.230 --> 05:31.897
That is what you call Millbrew.

05:31.937 --> 05:33.683
- Sorry?
- Bragg Creek.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.090
Flathead Lake, Creemore;

05:35.116 --> 05:38.021
What do all of these
crappy-ass towns have in common?

05:38.122 --> 05:41.291
They were all revitalized,
nay, reinvented...

05:41.392 --> 05:43.293
- Did you just say "nay"?
- By beer.

05:43.394 --> 05:45.795
By a local brewery to be more specific.

05:46.177 --> 05:48.131
Time to add Millwood to the list.

05:48.815 --> 05:51.037
- What's this?
- My plan to start

05:51.062 --> 05:53.073
a microbrewery right here, in Millwood.

05:53.124 --> 05:55.797
A microbrew brings tourists.
Some nice restaurants

05:55.822 --> 05:57.770
start to pop up. Next thing you know,

05:57.817 --> 06:00.461
town's hopping again. I've
actually done a ton of research.

06:00.486 --> 06:02.387
And it's pretty sound.

06:02.548 --> 06:06.215
I've even got investors
coming to talk this afternoon.

06:06.317 --> 06:08.084
You got an article about me in here.

06:08.185 --> 06:10.108
Yeah. I don't know
if you know, but what you did

06:10.133 --> 06:12.568
around here was a pretty big deal.

06:12.662 --> 06:13.929
I'm proud of you, man.

06:13.954 --> 06:16.216
Besides, she's a total smoke show.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.996
I'd keep that one in the spank bank.

06:19.703 --> 06:22.105
Crawford. Joanna?

06:22.223 --> 06:25.268
OK, that's just eerie.
If you build it...

06:26.483 --> 06:28.116
Why aren't you using your phone?

06:28.163 --> 06:29.843
It's a long story I
won't bore you with.

06:29.868 --> 06:31.265
I'm sure you're busy.

06:31.597 --> 06:32.803
Yeah.

06:32.903 --> 06:34.610
I didn't know who else to call.

06:34.712 --> 06:37.444
- What's going on?
- This case I'm working...

06:37.524 --> 06:39.897
- What case?
- This hacktivist kid,

06:39.922 --> 06:42.952
he's being sued by a private
military contractor.

06:43.053 --> 06:46.122
- Yeah, I read about that.
- It went kind of sideways.

06:46.254 --> 06:47.814
Is that why you're not
using your phone?

06:47.858 --> 06:50.696
- You know I can't tell you that.
- Look, if you're in danger,

06:50.721 --> 06:52.960
- privilege goes out the window.
- I'm fine.

06:53.060 --> 06:54.591
I'll be fine.

06:55.231 --> 06:57.433
That private security firm
you dealt with in town...

06:57.534 --> 06:59.152
Alright, now you're starting
to freak me out.

06:59.176 --> 07:02.305
Billy, can you get them to call me?

07:02.931 --> 07:04.440
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

07:06.079 --> 07:07.558
Hey,

07:07.670 --> 07:09.245
be careful.

07:10.613 --> 07:12.748
Bye, Billy.

07:15.007 --> 07:16.454
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:16.479 --> 07:19.281
I got the Lovand employee records,

07:19.306 --> 07:20.749
contractors, subcontractors

07:20.774 --> 07:22.480
dating back 15 years
just like you asked.

07:22.507 --> 07:24.594
- Thanks, Sunil.
- Lift with your knees.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.362
I mean, I... No, I can
put it down wherever.

07:26.386 --> 07:28.765
OK, I don't care.
I don't care. I don't care.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.632
- The answer is still no.
- Tough client?

07:30.668 --> 07:33.770
The toughest! My 11 year old
wants to pierce her belly button.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.046
Sorry I'm in late. Car trouble.

07:36.113 --> 07:37.493
This isn't a CTS, Joanna.

07:37.518 --> 07:39.732
No one's looking over your shoulder.

07:39.943 --> 07:43.179
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah. I think.

07:44.220 --> 07:46.516
My car got tampered with last night.

07:47.005 --> 07:48.851
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

07:48.952 --> 07:51.521
I think it has something to do
with our new case.

07:52.313 --> 07:53.725
Intimidation tactics?

07:53.778 --> 07:55.872
- It's nothing I can't handle.
- Good

07:55.897 --> 07:58.380
because this could be
a big case for us.

07:58.405 --> 07:59.507
This is a public figure;

07:59.532 --> 08:01.520
This guy could take
us to the next level.

08:01.545 --> 08:03.521
- With your help of course.
- Of course.

08:03.546 --> 08:06.594
I will be in my office going
over this tome if you need me.

08:06.674 --> 08:09.672
Joanna, to belly or not
to belly? That is the question.

08:09.773 --> 08:12.708
I feel like I could make a
compelling argument for both sides.

08:12.810 --> 08:15.110
- Of course you could.
- I will get my sister's

08:15.135 --> 08:17.904
expert opinion for you.

08:18.150 --> 08:20.783
What kind of lesbians
are you guys anyway?

08:20.884 --> 08:23.583
Apparently the kind that doesn't
know how to fix a television.

08:23.784 --> 08:26.845
Might be the only useful thing
that my father ever taught me.

08:26.870 --> 08:28.904
Hey, it's more than I can say for mine.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.858
I heard about the
charges being dropped.

08:31.943 --> 08:34.246
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

08:34.371 --> 08:37.467
Different rules apply
for rich white guys, I guess.

08:38.336 --> 08:39.846
Thanks for doing this, Tay.

08:39.871 --> 08:42.172
You know I can't live
without my videogames.

08:42.253 --> 08:43.393
Honestly, when you called,

08:43.418 --> 08:45.810
I was just happy to
have something to do.

08:45.839 --> 08:47.934
Taking it easy is kind
of driving me nuts.

08:47.997 --> 08:50.299
I wish my girlfriend had that problem.

08:50.581 --> 08:53.097
- What's that supposed to mean?
- University applications

08:53.122 --> 08:55.477
are due in less than a week,
and she still thinks

08:55.502 --> 08:57.757
- she's not going.
- "She" is

08:57.782 --> 08:59.683
sitting right here.

08:59.783 --> 09:01.684
I know.

09:01.777 --> 09:03.996
I'm just not spending
another year away from you.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.619
Montreal sounds awesome.

09:05.696 --> 09:08.108
I wish I could come with you guys.

09:08.201 --> 09:10.582
Sounds like somebody wants
to kiss some French boys.

09:10.635 --> 09:13.182
Actually,

09:13.214 --> 09:14.567
if my dad has his way,

09:14.592 --> 09:16.035
I'll be coming home any day now.

09:16.578 --> 09:18.988
- What is that?
- That's a letter from him.

09:19.013 --> 09:20.901
He sent it up with your uncle Billy.

09:21.692 --> 09:23.122
- And...?
- I don't know.

09:23.147 --> 09:26.275
I haven't read it yet.
You think I should?

09:26.383 --> 09:27.750
- Burn it.
- Absolutely.

09:28.166 --> 09:29.652
Thanks a lot!

09:32.351 --> 09:35.424
I'm just not sure that I'm ready
to hear his side of things.

09:35.526 --> 09:39.128
Deadbeat dads, we should just
abolish them all from the planet.

09:39.511 --> 09:41.595
Also, we have no food
in the cupboards,

09:41.620 --> 09:44.355
so I need to grab some takeout
before orientation.

09:45.289 --> 09:46.810
The Bear Clan thing,
I told you about it.

09:46.834 --> 09:49.705
Right. Yeah. I remember.

09:51.393 --> 09:55.511
- Hey, I got it!
- Yes! Taylor, you're a genius!

09:57.246 --> 09:59.415
- I love you.
- I love you more.

10:15.332 --> 10:18.968
Only one thing puts a smile
on your face like that.

10:19.503 --> 10:21.583
- How's she doing?
- She's great.

10:21.669 --> 10:23.839
She's on her way to volunteer
with the Bear Clan.

10:24.243 --> 10:25.975
It's our girl.

10:26.076 --> 10:27.843
Actually came to talk to you though.

10:27.945 --> 10:30.613
How are you doing
with all this Hanley business?

10:30.714 --> 10:32.370
Luna can't believe he
just gets away with it

10:32.394 --> 10:34.750
- just like she said he would.
- Joanna?

10:34.851 --> 10:36.786
She knows the law, I guess.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.324
Yeah, well, there's legal justice

10:38.349 --> 10:40.377
and there's actual justice.

10:40.510 --> 10:42.109
I won't stop until I get that.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.837
If the Crown doesn't think
there's a case then...

10:44.862 --> 10:47.216
Fine. They won't send him to jail;

10:47.241 --> 10:48.798
I'll send him to the bank.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.718
Are you talking about civil action?

10:50.743 --> 10:53.019
Money's the only thing
he cares about anyway.

10:53.184 --> 10:55.552
Now, I'll hire myself a good lawyer.

10:55.766 --> 10:57.613
- Crawford.
- Pff!

10:57.734 --> 11:00.674
No. Billy's too close to this.

11:00.844 --> 11:03.258
Lawsuits can get expensive;
You have money for that?

11:03.283 --> 11:06.073
- Still working that part out.
- Hey.

11:07.466 --> 11:09.785
Look, this is all still so fresh.

11:10.101 --> 11:12.121
You remember when my mom died?

11:12.222 --> 11:14.591
You told me not to make
any big life decisions

11:14.616 --> 11:16.957
- for at least six months.
- Except David Hanley

11:16.982 --> 11:19.896
is not dead. He's alive,
and he's walking around

11:19.921 --> 11:22.298
like he's made out of Teflon.
I just can't live with that.

11:24.629 --> 11:27.370
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah, put a bullet in him.

11:28.212 --> 11:29.805
I'm kidding.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.676
Sort of.

11:32.242 --> 11:34.243
You have a good day now, Owen.

11:37.681 --> 11:38.871
You too.

11:43.197 --> 11:44.464
Do you have any cayenne?

11:44.497 --> 11:46.736
I want to create an IPA
with a little kick.

11:47.631 --> 11:50.440
I like to play with the recipes.
I'm an artist, bro,

11:50.540 --> 11:52.668
- you know that.
- Yeah, and I'm a lawyer

11:52.769 --> 11:55.371
- with an MBA.
- Which is why we're the perfect team.

11:55.472 --> 11:57.980
- I reviewed your business model.
- Exciting, no?

11:58.047 --> 12:00.643
Shane, your floorplan
is drawn on a cocktail napkin.

12:01.101 --> 12:03.813
They're... preliminary renderings.

12:03.914 --> 12:06.133
I just think if you're
asking people for money...

12:06.158 --> 12:08.493
I'm not asking you for money.

12:10.113 --> 12:11.463
I didn't say that.

12:12.153 --> 12:14.457
This microbrewery
is a really good idea.

12:14.807 --> 12:16.226
- Thank you.
- But with money people,

12:16.250 --> 12:19.585
you have one chance to put
your best foot forward.

12:19.996 --> 12:21.715
- I think you should push the meeting.
- No way.

12:21.739 --> 12:23.552
Just 'til you're a little
more prepared to go in there.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.391
No. The window is open.

12:25.416 --> 12:26.763
We have to move on this now!

12:26.870 --> 12:29.805
Please, don't be
a buzzkill on this, Billy.

12:30.359 --> 12:33.584
Look, you did an amazing thing
for this town.

12:33.616 --> 12:36.035
I never have. Not one good thing

12:36.113 --> 12:37.848
in my whole life.

12:39.539 --> 12:41.951
We can bring this town
back to life, bro.

12:42.238 --> 12:43.812
Together.

12:48.892 --> 12:51.026
What time are you
meeting these investors?

12:51.716 --> 12:54.230
Yes! Yes!

13:25.490 --> 13:28.130
- Hello?
- Is this Joanna Chang?

13:28.231 --> 13:31.500
- Who is this?
- I'm a friend of Billy's.

13:33.572 --> 13:35.571
- Half-day, Boss?
- Something came up.

13:35.672 --> 13:37.324
I gotta go meet a client.

13:37.423 --> 13:39.643
Jared Lapinski,
He's an analyst Lovand hired

13:39.668 --> 13:41.777
on their military projects.
Do some digging for me?

13:41.878 --> 13:44.980
- On it like a bonnet.
- Thanks. I won't be long.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.626
- You didn't have trouble finding me?
- Just used my GPS.

14:18.491 --> 14:22.060
- I'm kidding.
- Billy said I'd like you.

14:22.326 --> 14:25.451
So, where should we start?

14:25.665 --> 14:27.738
Bro! Bro, bro, check this out.

14:27.763 --> 14:29.203
- Don't you knock?
- There's no door.

14:29.250 --> 14:32.816
- I thought I told you not to bug me.
- I know, but this was too good.

14:35.801 --> 14:38.102
- What am I looking at?
- Our logo.

14:38.700 --> 14:39.977
- OK...
- It just hit me.

14:40.002 --> 14:41.609
It's our initials woven together

14:41.634 --> 14:44.558
overlaid on the town's crest.
And look at the corner.

14:45.857 --> 14:47.639
It's the year Dad came to Millwood.

14:50.517 --> 14:53.657
You know, he asks
about you all the time.

14:53.717 --> 14:56.397
- It's not on the table.
- When was the last time you saw him?

14:56.422 --> 14:57.966
Shane...

14:58.317 --> 15:00.097
Are you gonna cry?

15:00.756 --> 15:02.680
Don't cry, Billy.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.070
Hey, it's OK.

15:04.095 --> 15:06.443
Look, you don't have to cry, Billy.
Don't cry.

15:06.468 --> 15:09.370
Get out! I'm working.

15:10.216 --> 15:12.063
Shut down any online presence.

15:12.164 --> 15:15.058
And whenever possible, deviate
from your normal routine.

15:15.137 --> 15:17.297
They're using disruption as a strategy.

15:17.322 --> 15:19.704
I used to do this
all the time at my old firm.

15:19.805 --> 15:22.073
You ever hacked into someone's car?

15:23.716 --> 15:25.517
Your safety is my main concern.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.589
I'm not letting them
bully me off this job.

15:27.646 --> 15:30.047
I'm gonna do whatever I can to help.

15:31.335 --> 15:33.869
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

15:34.286 --> 15:35.694
The truth?

15:38.036 --> 15:40.204
No.

15:42.979 --> 15:45.106
I'll pick your car up from the garage.

15:46.465 --> 15:48.566
It is all yours.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.054
I'll try to track the IP address

15:50.087 --> 15:52.330
for the threatening call,
but in the meantime,

15:52.380 --> 15:55.234
any communication between us,
we use this.

15:55.447 --> 15:58.810
We have to stay one step
ahead of them at all times.

16:02.047 --> 16:04.782
And take this threat very seriously.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.964
- Hello?
- Joanna, it's me.

16:41.989 --> 16:43.198
Look, you were right.

16:43.223 --> 16:45.296
Jared Lapinski is a major player.

16:45.398 --> 16:47.877
He's all over Lovand's website,
he worked in the same

16:47.902 --> 16:49.010
department as Noah,

16:49.035 --> 16:51.848
and it looks like he specializes
in this exact type of code.

16:52.055 --> 16:54.248
- Well, we're getting closer.
- You find this guy,

16:54.273 --> 16:56.433
I think you'll have all
the answers you're looking for.

17:03.382 --> 17:06.151
Indigenous women are going
missing and being murdered

17:06.175 --> 17:08.077
at an astronomical rate.

17:08.348 --> 17:10.548
A group of Winnipeggers had enough,

17:10.974 --> 17:12.563
started Bear Clan Patrol.

17:12.887 --> 17:14.425
We stop fights,

17:14.527 --> 17:16.047
break-ins,

17:16.161 --> 17:18.563
keep an eye on sex workers,

17:18.897 --> 17:21.700
make sure intoxicated
people get home safely.

17:22.094 --> 17:24.095
It's all about safety.

17:26.667 --> 17:29.981
I've worked out a few broad strokes
that we can present them with.

17:30.143 --> 17:33.896
Also drafted up a quick
partnership agreement between us.

17:33.921 --> 17:37.258
- You don't trust me?
- Is that a trick question?

17:37.650 --> 17:40.707
If this gains traction, we'll have
to go over this in more detail,

17:40.732 --> 17:44.083
but let's just go through it for
now so we're on the same page.

17:44.488 --> 17:46.091
Stout sampler while we do?

17:47.455 --> 17:48.822
Yeah.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.489
That's my boy.

17:53.291 --> 17:54.826
Feels good to be home.

17:54.927 --> 17:56.891
It's good to have you home.

17:57.138 --> 17:59.615
Yeah, I had to get
the hell out of Dodge.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.856
Alright. We'll split the
majority stake hold 50/50.

18:05.924 --> 18:08.826
You maintain 100% ownership of the IP,

18:08.988 --> 18:11.508
and I'm willing
to bankroll some start-up costs.

18:11.750 --> 18:14.092
Really? You'd do that?

18:14.484 --> 18:16.138
We get this going, we'd be able to hire

18:16.163 --> 18:18.255
a few people right away, so...

18:18.570 --> 18:20.505
that's something
I'm willing to invest in.

18:21.168 --> 18:24.035
This is gonna hit, bro. I can feel it.

18:24.136 --> 18:27.322
If it doesn't,
I built in a mutual out clause.

18:27.415 --> 18:28.895
If either of us are unhappy

18:28.920 --> 18:31.209
with the arrangement
at any time, we can exit.

18:31.504 --> 18:33.197
Do we get to stay brothers?

18:33.264 --> 18:36.648
Yeah, there's no loophole for that.
I've been looking for years.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.552
To beer!

18:41.834 --> 18:43.688
"If I were aboard a rowboat"

18:43.789 --> 18:47.037
"floating in the middle of all the
beer I've drunk in a lifetime",

18:47.128 --> 18:49.017
"I'd never be able to see the shore."

18:50.328 --> 18:55.441
Al Purdy. His poems always
remind me of the old man.

18:59.132 --> 19:02.067
Right. No-fly zone.

19:02.348 --> 19:03.849
Sorry.

19:08.846 --> 19:10.914
What?

19:12.106 --> 19:13.752
I didn't say anything.

19:14.333 --> 19:17.140
- Sorry, I thought.
- Dude, how "sampled" are you?

19:17.165 --> 19:19.048
I'm good.

19:19.297 --> 19:20.570
Brain fart.

19:20.595 --> 19:22.414
Come on! Game face.

19:22.491 --> 19:24.971
Alright. Go put on a clean shirt.
Actually...

19:25.064 --> 19:27.891
put on one of mine.
We better get going.

19:39.050 --> 19:41.251
Hi. I'm looking for Jared Lapinski.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.581
- Who are you?
- My name is Joanna Chang.

19:43.606 --> 19:45.874
I'm a lawyer at Steadman Lavery.

19:46.052 --> 19:49.220
- Is this about the computer?
- I'm sorry?

19:49.321 --> 19:51.222
Haven't you people done enough?

19:51.489 --> 19:54.788
I was just hoping that I
could speak with Mr. Lapinski.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.275
Then, you should have
been here a few days ago,

19:57.396 --> 19:59.631
before he killed himself.

20:07.613 --> 20:10.712
So, when we get there, I'm gonna
wow them with the opening spiel,

20:10.800 --> 20:13.690
and then you come in and you wow
them with the numbers.

20:14.370 --> 20:17.105
- Are you letting me drive?
- No, we're not driving.

20:17.192 --> 20:18.497
What are you talking about?

20:18.522 --> 20:20.411
Shane, I've been drinking
your beer since breakfast.

20:20.435 --> 20:22.364
Dude, the legal limit in Millwood

20:22.389 --> 20:23.678
is being able to find your keys.
Come on.

20:23.702 --> 20:25.235
No. Not doing that again.

20:25.431 --> 20:27.634
- Alright. Give me the keys.
- No, no. Wait,

20:27.661 --> 20:29.461
you've been going non-stop
since you got here,

20:29.486 --> 20:31.516
which we should also
talk about at some point.

20:31.541 --> 20:32.921
I've been back for one day,

20:32.947 --> 20:34.643
and you want to lecture me on
my self-medicating already?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.478
"Self-medicating," is
that you're calling it?

20:36.503 --> 20:38.190
That's what alcohol is, Billy boy.

20:38.215 --> 20:41.203
It's the cause of and solution
to all of life's problems.

20:41.228 --> 20:42.607
Is that more Al Purdy?

20:42.632 --> 20:44.604
- Homer Simpson.
- Different kind of poet.

20:44.629 --> 20:46.580
- Get in the truck, Billy.
- Not a chance.

20:46.647 --> 20:48.281
I can't believe you're gonna
sabotage this for me, man.

20:48.305 --> 20:50.334
- Whoa, calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!

20:50.359 --> 20:51.647
- Shane...
- Wind me up,

20:51.672 --> 20:53.250
and you tell me to calm down?
Don't do that!

20:53.274 --> 20:54.954
- Don't do that to me!
- Shane...

20:58.851 --> 21:00.326
Sorry.

21:00.798 --> 21:02.762
I... I feel like

21:02.978 --> 21:05.064
I've got a lot of people
counting on me.

21:06.006 --> 21:07.806
I got a lot riding on
this working out, Billy.

21:08.185 --> 21:10.903
Look, it takes me 25 minutes
to jog from here to Main Street.

21:11.375 --> 21:14.518
We got time, if we go at a good clip.

21:14.719 --> 21:16.391
We're gonna jog into town?

21:16.460 --> 21:19.462
Yeah, unless you don't
think you can keep up.

21:22.728 --> 21:25.468
Let's go, old man.
What are you waiting for?

21:29.740 --> 21:31.316
How did the Lapinski meeting go?

21:31.341 --> 21:35.090
- It didn't, he's dead.
- Ouch!

21:35.776 --> 21:37.780
He killed himself three days ago.

21:37.875 --> 21:39.664
Double ouch. So I guess
that means you don't need

21:39.688 --> 21:41.768
- that witness anymore.
- What are you talking about?

21:41.827 --> 21:43.296
Lovand counsel, he's...

21:43.321 --> 21:44.879
waiting to side-bar with
you in the conference room.

21:44.903 --> 21:46.051
What? Lovand is here?!

21:46.079 --> 21:48.347
- Yeah, I thought you knew that.
- No. They're trying

21:48.372 --> 21:50.626
to get in my head.
They're doing this on purpose.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.628
Next time, lead with that.

21:53.021 --> 21:55.701
OK. Is this a teachable moment or
should I be looking for a new job?

21:55.766 --> 21:58.411
I'm still deciding.
Meet me in the boardroom in 5.

22:00.203 --> 22:01.348
It's apples and oranges.

22:01.373 --> 22:03.338
One's blonde, the other's a brunette.

22:03.458 --> 22:06.175
One's got family money;
The other's wholesome...

22:06.264 --> 22:08.322
Someone's holding a gun to your head.

22:08.445 --> 22:10.346
- Betty.
- Really?

22:10.413 --> 22:11.908
Yeah, Betty.

22:12.008 --> 22:14.543
Wow! This is... Wow!

22:14.884 --> 22:17.719
- You thought I'd go for money.
- Absolutely.

22:18.319 --> 22:19.822
Where are you boys running to?

22:19.923 --> 22:21.969
We're heading into town
for a business meeting.

22:22.023 --> 22:24.003
Off to "Make Millwood great again."

22:24.063 --> 22:25.737
We're going to meet
some potential investors

22:25.761 --> 22:27.891
on a project that might bring
some work back to town.

22:27.916 --> 22:30.199
I'm all for that. Where's the truck?

22:31.001 --> 22:32.335
Wouldn't start.

22:32.436 --> 22:34.096
- I'll give you a lift.
- Really?

22:34.193 --> 22:36.672
Any chance to revive this town. Hop in.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.780
- Shotgun!
- No.

22:47.184 --> 22:49.585
So I ran into Gerrilynn.

22:49.853 --> 22:52.054
She said she's thinking
about suing David Hanley.

22:52.674 --> 22:55.591
- Why hasn't she called me?
- She's worried you're too close.

22:56.190 --> 22:58.230
Like Hanley's family or something.

22:58.296 --> 23:01.611
That piece of shit
is not part of our family.

23:01.678 --> 23:03.566
Someone should've taken
a run at him years ago.

23:04.629 --> 23:06.435
Anyway, I thought you should know.

23:08.071 --> 23:09.683
Thanks.

23:10.253 --> 23:11.874
Yo, Beck.

23:11.975 --> 23:15.144
Betty or Veronica, who do you choose?

23:16.072 --> 23:18.307
Buffy Sainte-Marie.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.201
When your call came into the office,

23:21.225 --> 23:23.126
I kind of jumped to take the listing.

23:23.186 --> 23:25.033
Um, six degrees of David Hanley?

23:25.058 --> 23:26.973
Yeah, something like that.

23:28.166 --> 23:29.852
I'm sorry that I didn't call

23:29.877 --> 23:31.992
when they dropped the
criminal charges...

23:32.030 --> 23:33.279
I was too...

23:33.304 --> 23:36.199
Yeah, me too. It's why I'm selling,

23:36.279 --> 23:39.119
then I'll have the money
and take care of him myself.

23:39.402 --> 23:42.608
No, I'm not putting
a hit out on him.

23:43.485 --> 23:45.775
Too bad. I'd have chipped in.

23:45.876 --> 23:48.311
I'm suing him for sexual misconduct

23:48.336 --> 23:49.919
and coercing a minor.

23:50.085 --> 23:52.504
Well, you're a braver woman than me.

23:52.884 --> 23:54.584
Or just stupider.

23:54.956 --> 23:56.376
This is Luna's room.

23:56.559 --> 23:57.820
She's been away all year,

23:57.845 --> 24:00.352
but I haven't had the heart
to change things much.

24:02.016 --> 24:04.203
Best moments of my life
happened in this room

24:04.268 --> 24:07.540
Bringing her tea,
snuggling her to sleep.

24:08.491 --> 24:11.193
But it's just a house, right?

24:11.249 --> 24:13.523
Kinda seemed more like a home.

24:13.710 --> 24:15.845
Never had one of those.

24:15.986 --> 24:17.887
Me neither.

24:18.055 --> 24:20.880
That's what he knew,
what he took advantage of.

24:21.137 --> 24:22.704
Prick.

24:22.966 --> 24:24.794
Yeah. Either way,

24:24.819 --> 24:26.334
Luna's a lucky girl.

24:26.412 --> 24:28.651
Mhm. So am I.

24:29.946 --> 24:33.396
So, what do you think
I could get for this bad boy?

24:33.684 --> 24:37.386
Umm, I made a preliminary assessment.

24:38.038 --> 24:39.528
Don't sell the house.

24:39.569 --> 24:41.831
Cases like ours, guys like him;

24:41.898 --> 24:44.200
Even if you win,
it's not gonna be enough.

24:44.225 --> 24:45.875
It's never gonna be enough.

24:46.063 --> 24:48.598
- I want him to pay.
- So do I.

24:48.714 --> 24:52.732
I just don't want you to
any more than you already have.

24:54.511 --> 24:55.978
Hey!

24:56.007 --> 24:58.481
- Hey!
- I got you some green juice

24:58.582 --> 25:02.585
- and a Flexi nature bar thing.
- Thanks,

25:02.610 --> 25:04.241
but I'm actually too excited to eat.

25:04.291 --> 25:06.678
It's not really like
eating; It's more like work.

25:06.703 --> 25:09.145
So Bear Clan was cool?

25:09.225 --> 25:11.679
My God, Tay!
I know it was just orientation,

25:11.704 --> 25:15.031
but I feel like my eyes
have been opened.

25:15.441 --> 25:17.538
That's amazing!

25:17.652 --> 25:19.175
Maybe now you'll have a place

25:19.200 --> 25:22.247
to channel some of
your David-Hanley rage.

25:23.301 --> 25:25.441
Sorry. I shouldn't call it rage.

25:25.542 --> 25:27.802
No, no. It's rage.

25:28.242 --> 25:30.135
I was just thinking
how I'd like to channel

25:30.160 --> 25:32.415
some of it directly at him.

25:32.516 --> 25:35.475
- You mean like, confront him?
- I've thought about it.

25:35.852 --> 25:37.987
What would you say?

25:39.733 --> 25:42.358
I don't know. Or what I'd do.

25:44.614 --> 25:46.227
Do you think it's weird

25:46.252 --> 25:48.884
that I texted you to meet me
here and not Molly?

25:49.994 --> 25:52.660
I don't know. I think
sometimes you need to talk

25:52.685 --> 25:54.870
to someone you're not
also sleeping with.

25:55.321 --> 25:58.841
I just... I feel like,
since I got back,

25:58.942 --> 26:00.643
like I'm bringing her down
or something.

26:00.736 --> 26:02.812
She hasn't said anything to me.

26:03.106 --> 26:05.874
We're just in
different places, I guess.

26:08.322 --> 26:09.681
Maybe you guys need to move

26:09.706 --> 26:12.092
in different directions for a while...

26:12.387 --> 26:15.157
to realize how much you guys
need to come back together.

26:15.641 --> 26:18.435
- When did you get so wise?
- When my father

26:18.460 --> 26:21.029
poisoned our hometown
and gave me cancer.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.699
And that grows you up a bit.

26:24.741 --> 26:26.153
Yeah.

26:28.639 --> 26:30.999
Have you decided what you're
gonna do about the letter?

26:31.119 --> 26:33.132
No. Not yet.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.678
Well, you know,
whichever way you decide,

26:35.779 --> 26:37.684
I've got your back.

26:38.115 --> 26:41.117
Right back at you.

26:53.770 --> 26:56.138
Shane, are those your investors?

26:58.456 --> 26:59.529
This right here

26:59.554 --> 27:01.317
is what we're looking at
as an initial investment.

27:01.341 --> 27:02.567
And that would be amortized?

27:02.592 --> 27:05.044
Over a five-year operating
budget, that's correct.

27:05.095 --> 27:07.355
We've got our feelers
out on several projects,

27:07.380 --> 27:10.171
but we're really looking
for our Trivial Pursuit.

27:10.334 --> 27:12.581
Our gran was one of
the initial investors.

27:12.606 --> 27:15.205
A thousand-buck investment
turned into twenty mil. Bam!

27:15.327 --> 27:17.727
Well, I'm not sure we can offer
those kind of profit margins.

27:17.788 --> 27:20.790
- My brother's just being cautious.
- Realistic.

27:20.891 --> 27:22.858
Guys, can you do a cannabis beer?

27:22.959 --> 27:25.870
Seriously, dude, the government
just put 600k into research on it.

27:25.923 --> 27:27.957
A weed beer?

27:28.010 --> 27:30.117
- Sick!
- Hahaha!

27:30.423 --> 27:32.535
Can we see this location

27:32.636 --> 27:35.070
where we're planning
to build this oasis of ale?

27:35.172 --> 27:37.471
- We'd like to take some specs.
- For sure.

27:37.553 --> 27:39.684
Road trip! Love it!

27:39.976 --> 27:41.723
I'll call Jeff, the property manager,

27:41.773 --> 27:43.879
tell him to meet us there.
Let's bounce!

27:46.961 --> 27:48.851
They're Trustafarians.

27:48.952 --> 27:51.987
People come in all shades
and colours, Billy boy,

27:52.088 --> 27:54.224
but money is always green.

27:54.284 --> 27:55.837
Hey, who's Jeff?

27:55.957 --> 27:58.527
Jeff. You know Jeff.

28:02.936 --> 28:03.975
The app is still

28:04.000 --> 28:05.637
up and running; That has got to change.

28:05.673 --> 28:08.153
I have advised my client to
comply with the injunction.

28:08.226 --> 28:10.593
- And why hasn't he?
- You know as well as I do

28:10.618 --> 28:13.209
that clients don't always
listen to their lawyers.

28:13.310 --> 28:15.644
Maybe we haven't been
persuasive enough.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.997
His contempt hearing
is in less than two hours.

28:21.022 --> 28:22.678
- We'd like to avoid it.
- So would we.

28:22.703 --> 28:25.883
- How we can make that happen?
- Lift the injunction against my client.

28:25.908 --> 28:27.847
That's not an option.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.329
He pulls the app,

28:31.355 --> 28:34.029
we cover all legal fees
incurred to this point.

28:38.801 --> 28:40.914
My client owns a company,

28:41.107 --> 28:44.438
a new start-up called Novatech
based in Silicon Valley.

28:44.627 --> 28:45.804
Novatech is all about

28:45.829 --> 28:48.558
innovation and privacy.

28:48.768 --> 28:50.560
Right up Mr. Achari's alley.

28:50.671 --> 28:52.778
My client is willing to
make him operating manager.

28:52.803 --> 28:56.418
- Starting salary?
- One that you or I can't even fathom.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.309
If he rejects this offer,

29:00.334 --> 29:03.637
of course, we'll have no choice
but to see you in court.

29:03.994 --> 29:06.395
I will take the offer to my client.

29:12.301 --> 29:14.869
I think I need to check my underwear.

29:16.806 --> 29:20.359
- It's a good offer.
- It's a great offer.

29:20.810 --> 29:22.751
He'd be stupid not to take it.

29:22.832 --> 29:25.205
- I'm not taking it.
- Please!

29:25.292 --> 29:27.554
Forget it!
I'm not working for the enemy.

29:27.604 --> 29:29.188
You worked for them before!

29:29.213 --> 29:31.874
And look how well that
turned out for Lapinski.

29:31.982 --> 29:34.116
This is an interesting offer, Noah.

29:34.187 --> 29:36.027
The only interesting thing about it

29:36.085 --> 29:38.257
is the fact that you thought
it was worth sharing with me.

29:38.281 --> 29:41.554
OK, as your lawyer, I have to
advise you to take this deal.

29:41.579 --> 29:44.890
And as your client, I have
to advise you that you're fired.

29:44.967 --> 29:47.353
You are due in court

29:47.378 --> 29:50.713
to face contempt charges
in less than two hours.

29:50.746 --> 29:53.369
Yeah, OK, and I'll be there, alone.

29:53.462 --> 29:56.030
From now on, I'm representing myself.

30:30.836 --> 30:31.963
Hello?

30:31.988 --> 30:34.550
I managed to track the IP
address for the car hacking.

30:35.248 --> 30:37.062
- Lovand?
- Yes.

30:37.163 --> 30:39.231
Good thing you didn't
mention them to the cops.

30:40.094 --> 30:42.501
- Why?
- They're defense contractors.

30:42.602 --> 30:44.600
Where do you think
retired cops go to work?

30:44.697 --> 30:47.715
Watch your back... more than ever now.

30:52.812 --> 30:56.615
Someone was blackmailing him.
I have proof.

30:57.049 --> 30:59.132
Please.

30:59.586 --> 31:01.263
Come in.

31:05.181 --> 31:06.981
Thought your guy was meeting us here.

31:07.247 --> 31:08.812
He should be here.

31:08.977 --> 31:12.016
- Did you actually talk to him?
- Left a message.

31:12.753 --> 31:15.308
We like you guys and
this project quite a bit,

31:15.333 --> 31:18.493
but it'd really help
to see the facility.

31:19.509 --> 31:22.554
- Screw it!
- Hey, what are you doing?

31:22.628 --> 31:24.812
Jeff won't mind if we
get started without him.

31:25.295 --> 31:26.521
Come on, fellas.

31:26.573 --> 31:30.039
Unless you boys don't
think you can scale it.

31:31.147 --> 31:33.428
Partner, you coming?

31:34.390 --> 31:35.924
Damnit, Shane.

31:40.189 --> 31:42.669
He wasn't himself for months before.

31:42.875 --> 31:45.114
Paranoid, withdrawn.

31:45.301 --> 31:47.302
Now I know why.

31:48.295 --> 31:50.886
Perfect credit score to bankruptcy.

31:51.303 --> 31:54.932
Online casino debts,
Ashley Madison account...

31:55.065 --> 31:57.426
Why didn't he tell me
that he was being set up?

31:57.586 --> 31:59.163
I don't know.

31:59.439 --> 32:01.421
Maybe he was trying to protect you.

32:04.109 --> 32:05.643
What?

32:05.879 --> 32:08.232
A few weeks back, he got really drunk,

32:08.257 --> 32:10.659
which also really wasn't like him,

32:10.666 --> 32:14.487
and he started saying all the
horrible things he'd done at work.

32:14.512 --> 32:15.581
How much did you know

32:15.606 --> 32:17.764
- about what he did at work?
- Not a lot.

32:17.814 --> 32:20.351
I know he worked for a small firm here

32:20.376 --> 32:24.127
that was owned by a huge
conglomerate based in Houston.

32:24.152 --> 32:25.703
Lovand?

32:26.218 --> 32:29.336
When I came by earlier,
you mentioned his computer.

32:29.436 --> 32:31.987
The police seized his computer.

32:32.088 --> 32:35.145
They received an anonymous tip
that he was in possession

32:35.170 --> 32:37.138
of child pornography.

32:37.552 --> 32:39.553
And then that night, he...

32:43.805 --> 32:45.527
I knew it couldn't be true.

32:45.552 --> 32:49.104
I knew he wasn't capable
of that, but then...

32:49.205 --> 32:51.325
- But then he killed himself.
- Yeah.

32:51.425 --> 32:53.273
- And you thought...
- Yeah.

32:54.229 --> 32:58.580
I can't believe I doubted him.

32:59.127 --> 33:01.962
He was just trying to protect me.

33:04.925 --> 33:06.826
Am I still in danger?

33:07.458 --> 33:09.467
The night he got really drunk,

33:09.492 --> 33:11.460
he started talking about

33:11.561 --> 33:15.206
his family, that we were
somehow his vulnerability,

33:15.231 --> 33:17.621
that somehow he put us in harm's way.

33:19.204 --> 33:22.664
Hey, Joanna.

33:26.501 --> 33:28.502
What have you done with my sister?

33:30.391 --> 33:32.826
Sorry. I'm sorry.

33:33.372 --> 33:35.383
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

33:35.763 --> 33:38.920
No. I don't know. Difficult client.

33:40.096 --> 33:41.756
Wanna come in for a cup of tea?

33:43.583 --> 33:46.085
- Yeah, I'd love that.
- OK.

33:52.641 --> 33:54.396
How long are we gonna wait, bro?

33:54.421 --> 33:55.704
Jeff should be here in a minute.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.521
You've been saying
that for half an hour.

33:57.546 --> 33:59.055
What a bust! Guy's a freak.

33:59.208 --> 34:02.344
- Come again?
- Dude, it's OK.

34:02.438 --> 34:03.850
No, I know it's OK.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.324
I just want to make
sure I heard you right.

34:05.348 --> 34:08.150
Did I stutter?
Your little boy bro's a freak.

34:08.251 --> 34:10.819
Guys, let's keep it calm.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.788
Rivers of beer, lakes of money.

34:14.592 --> 34:17.772
Let's jet, man. 'Cause I need to leave
this hick, douche town.

34:17.797 --> 34:18.847
OK.

34:28.591 --> 34:30.589
Yeah, they weren't the
right fit for us anyway.

34:30.614 --> 34:32.060
Zip it, Shane.

34:32.984 --> 34:35.100
He deserved to be punished...

34:35.871 --> 34:37.608
our father, but...

34:38.813 --> 34:40.949
but I didn't want him to be.

34:41.283 --> 34:43.118
Not like you did.

34:48.934 --> 34:52.027
Do you think it was a mistake
moving in here with her?

34:52.668 --> 34:53.929
What? You and Molly?

34:54.201 --> 34:56.347
- No, you guys make a great team.
- I know.

34:56.431 --> 34:59.657
But living together, it's different.

34:59.750 --> 35:01.324
I would not know.

35:01.377 --> 35:03.177
I've never lived with anyone.

35:03.304 --> 35:06.317
I think I might know someone

35:06.342 --> 35:09.077
you work in the flesh and blood with...

35:09.408 --> 35:11.813
Saved by the text.

35:12.359 --> 35:14.360
We're not done with this.

35:17.405 --> 35:18.880
Luna, where's your computer?

35:18.905 --> 35:21.690
We have laws to protect our privacy.

35:21.791 --> 35:23.931
Breaking and entering, peeping toms,

35:23.956 --> 35:25.355
stalking; These are crimes.

35:25.380 --> 35:26.752
So what am I looking at?

35:26.829 --> 35:28.897
You know, that difficult client?

35:28.998 --> 35:31.499
He's representing himself
in a contempt hearing.

35:32.216 --> 35:35.996
Corporations manipulate what
we watch, what we read...

35:36.021 --> 35:38.176
Is he allowed to video
record in a courtroom?

35:38.201 --> 35:39.344
Absolutely not.

35:39.369 --> 35:41.710
- Will he get arrested for that?
- Probably not.

35:41.811 --> 35:44.899
And we don't have any
kind of freedom, and so

35:44.924 --> 35:48.350
we need laws that act...

35:48.451 --> 35:52.249
But he will definitely
get arrested for that.

36:08.123 --> 36:11.926
Not only will you have
no privacy in the future,

36:12.020 --> 36:14.402
any privacy you thought
you had in the past

36:14.463 --> 36:17.079
will vanish as well. Of course,

36:17.189 --> 36:19.568
you'd argue this won't actually happen

36:19.593 --> 36:21.800
because I don't have anything to hide

36:21.825 --> 36:23.999
and the law protects me.

36:24.185 --> 36:28.113
For now, that's half true.
Western societies

36:28.153 --> 36:29.652
- are the main advocates...
- Hey.

36:29.704 --> 36:31.545
Are you following the Noah situation?

36:31.647 --> 36:33.040
It's kind of hard not to.

36:33.065 --> 36:34.650
It's all over the morning news cycle.

36:34.688 --> 36:36.317
Well, the bail hearing is in an hour.

36:36.418 --> 36:39.099
- Privacy issues...
- He broke up with me.

36:39.412 --> 36:40.667
I didn't hire a quitter.

36:40.759 --> 36:43.758
- It's time to win him back.
- I'm on it.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.463
Joanna,

36:45.488 --> 36:47.778
we only get one shot at
this, don't screw it up.

36:47.896 --> 36:51.144
Advocating for less
of governmental security.

36:51.299 --> 36:55.348
We can change the future!
In fact, we must!

37:02.607 --> 37:04.190
Every lawyer I've spoken to says

37:04.215 --> 37:06.217
this case isn't worth taking.

37:07.015 --> 37:09.350
That's because you
haven't spoken to me yet.

37:15.623 --> 37:18.292
- I'm going to pay you.
- Of course.

37:18.693 --> 37:20.261
After we win.

37:21.499 --> 37:22.854
Now, the first order

37:22.879 --> 37:24.879
of business will be
to create a statement of claim.

37:25.893 --> 37:28.169
- Sounds daunting.
- It's not.

37:28.194 --> 37:29.640
It's just your story.

37:29.665 --> 37:32.185
Everything you remember about
your encounters with David Hanley.

37:33.966 --> 37:36.033
You got any whiskey for this coffee?

37:36.773 --> 37:38.713
Now, this will be public record,

37:38.790 --> 37:40.797
so anything you say can and,

37:40.822 --> 37:42.841
knowing Hanley, will
likely be contested.

37:45.984 --> 37:49.290
I'm gonna record this if that's
alright with you.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.897
- You're ready?
- Are you kidding?

37:55.998 --> 37:59.066
I've been waiting 20 years for this.

38:06.241 --> 38:08.843
I met David at the Millwood
Golf and Country Club,

38:09.230 --> 38:12.199
where he was a member and I worked.

38:15.450 --> 38:17.356
I was just a kid.

38:33.835 --> 38:35.836
Brought you hash browns.

38:37.472 --> 38:39.359
I crashed at Julia's last night.

38:39.384 --> 38:41.566
You got my text, right?

38:43.459 --> 38:46.617
- Are you mad at me?
- Stop.

38:46.682 --> 38:49.383
Stop. Stop.

38:53.136 --> 38:54.779
I'm gonna shower.

38:54.895 --> 38:58.673
You can come with me if you want...

39:19.781 --> 39:22.623
Yeah. Well, I don't
like to be humiliated.

39:22.813 --> 39:25.820
Yes! Yes, that's exactly
what happened, Jeff.

39:25.999 --> 39:27.693
No, no, I had my people there,

39:27.718 --> 39:28.787
ready to open their wallets,

39:28.811 --> 39:30.453
and all you had to do was show up.

39:30.503 --> 39:32.860
So what are you gonna do about it?

39:33.339 --> 39:34.939
I thought you were
a serious businessman.

39:34.963 --> 39:36.528
I thought that I was dealing with a...

39:36.553 --> 39:38.386
No, don't. Don't...

39:44.025 --> 39:46.026
No. No, it's not.

39:47.649 --> 39:49.600
No, it's not.

39:50.925 --> 39:55.223
Don't say that to me.
Don't say that to me.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.304
I don't need you.

40:11.620 --> 40:14.121
It's not true. It's not true.

40:15.153 --> 40:16.630
Mr. Achari,

40:16.655 --> 40:19.584
you are being charged with one
count under the Justice Act

40:19.609 --> 40:21.749
for video recording in court

40:21.816 --> 40:24.969
and one count of assaulting
a peace officer.

40:25.779 --> 40:27.674
Do you have a lawyer?

40:30.408 --> 40:34.021
I'm actually representing myself.

40:34.122 --> 40:36.295
Not at a show cause hearing you're not.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.512
I'm appointing duty counsel.

40:44.395 --> 40:46.067
Mr. Tillson.

40:46.295 --> 40:47.768
Your Majesty,

40:47.793 --> 40:50.714
Mr. Achari was already being
held in contempt of court

40:50.739 --> 40:52.847
when he took it upon himself to record

40:52.872 --> 40:55.467
and livestream the proceedings.

40:55.673 --> 40:58.227
- I was just proving a point.
- Sir.

40:58.860 --> 41:00.394
I just find it really interesting

41:00.419 --> 41:02.416
how fiercely the court protects
its own privacy when...

41:02.440 --> 41:04.266
- Sir!
- Mr. Achari,

41:04.340 --> 41:06.887
I advise you to remain silent.

41:07.512 --> 41:09.229
Mr. Tillson, proceed.

41:09.324 --> 41:12.326
When an officer of the
peace tried to stop.

41:12.351 --> 41:14.668
Mr. Achari and apprehend his phone,

41:14.693 --> 41:18.933
Mr. Achari shoved the
officer, and a tussle ensued.

41:20.093 --> 41:22.303
Is there a surety present in the court?

41:22.397 --> 41:24.765
- Yeah.
- State your name for the court.

41:24.873 --> 41:26.176
Mara Tran.

41:26.201 --> 41:28.277
What's your relationship
to the accused?

41:28.302 --> 41:30.837
I'm his girlfriend, business partner.

41:31.176 --> 41:32.563
You live together?

41:32.650 --> 41:34.048
- Yeah.
- Any kids?

41:34.149 --> 41:35.563
OK. I don't see how that's

41:35.588 --> 41:37.676
- any of your business...
- Sir! No, no.

41:37.701 --> 41:38.996
You know what?

41:39.047 --> 41:42.189
I have no reason to believe
that you are gonna stop

41:42.290 --> 41:44.540
thumbing your nose at my court.

41:44.675 --> 41:49.087
And for that reason, I am detaining you
with no bond.

41:49.112 --> 41:50.525
- No, you can't do that!
- No, no. It's not fair!

41:50.549 --> 41:52.433
Your Majesty, Joanna Chang,

41:52.534 --> 41:53.902
counsel for the accused.

41:53.927 --> 41:56.737
Sorry I'm late. Traffic. If I may?

41:56.838 --> 41:58.973
If it'll stop him from talking.

42:00.293 --> 42:02.682
First, let me just say

42:02.735 --> 42:04.295
I'm sorry that your courtroom

42:04.340 --> 42:06.348
has been turned into a sideshow.

42:06.656 --> 42:09.563
When I found out that you were
the justice presiding,

42:09.588 --> 42:10.930
I did a little research,

42:10.955 --> 42:14.121
and I found a blog post you wrote

42:14.222 --> 42:16.734
dated April 2017.

42:16.824 --> 42:18.340
Where, in reference

42:18.365 --> 42:20.861
to an intern who apparently
didn't work out,

42:20.962 --> 42:23.164
you wrote a lengthy rant

42:23.265 --> 42:25.399
against the Millennial generation

42:25.493 --> 42:28.125
with their "avocado toast"

42:28.150 --> 42:32.852
and "faces glued to screens
like drooling baboons"

42:32.995 --> 42:37.645
"thinking that they should
get trophies for being gluten-free."

42:38.940 --> 42:40.748
Should I go on?

42:41.634 --> 42:43.527
Because of your obvious animus

42:43.552 --> 42:46.143
against my client, technology

42:46.168 --> 42:48.345
and, really, his entire generation,

42:48.370 --> 42:53.023
we ask that you recuse yourself
from this file, Your Majesty.

42:54.529 --> 42:56.341
You were bloody brilliant, lady.

42:56.366 --> 42:58.656
- "Lady"?
- Joanna, meet Mara.

42:58.681 --> 42:59.762
Enchantée.

42:59.787 --> 43:01.242
Those are some serious bond conditions;

43:01.266 --> 43:02.497
You make sure he sticks to them.

43:02.521 --> 43:04.271
Don't worry, I have my ways.

43:04.372 --> 43:07.367
Look, I feel like I owe you an apology.

43:07.561 --> 43:08.909
Save your breath.

43:08.934 --> 43:11.145
You gained 100000
new followers last night.

43:11.246 --> 43:13.507
150. Who's counting?

43:13.627 --> 43:16.548
You got arrested on purpose
as a publicity stunt.

43:16.573 --> 43:18.467
It was a command performance.

43:18.620 --> 43:21.689
- Yours wasn't so bad either.
- We got a lot of work to do.

43:21.790 --> 43:23.624
That is if I am still your lawyer.

43:24.003 --> 43:27.529
You know, I think this
is the start of a...

43:27.730 --> 43:29.029
beautiful friendship.
