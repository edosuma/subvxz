WEBVTT

00:58.158 --> 00:59.526
Stop getting in the way.

01:01.528 --> 01:03.463
I can't focus on practice

01:05.465 --> 01:06.566
in my studio.

01:07.434 --> 01:08.301
Your studio?

01:08.968 --> 01:09.836
Yes.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.038
My studio.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.574
Why are you two being like this?

01:14.641 --> 01:18.044
There's no reason to take sides and fight.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.480
Of course there is.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.850
They took our dorm from us,

01:24.451 --> 01:26.086
and now he calls this room his studio.

01:29.055 --> 01:31.791
You were just couch surfing, anyway.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.136
So, you didn't even have your own room?

01:43.870 --> 01:45.338
How absurd.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.084
Why did you say that?

02:06.826 --> 02:07.961
Hey, Jin Yu-jin.

02:08.728 --> 02:11.197
I didn't bring it up to embarrass you.
Can we talk about--

02:11.264 --> 02:12.932
-Do you think you're a saint?
-What?

02:15.702 --> 02:18.338
Aren't you angry?
Don't you think it's unfair?

02:18.872 --> 02:21.040
They're so full of themselves
even after taking what was yours.

02:23.176 --> 02:24.811
They didn't take anything from me.

02:25.545 --> 02:26.813
I let things be taken from me.

02:28.715 --> 02:29.682
What's the difference?

02:32.118 --> 02:33.920
Do you think it's okay for them to take

02:34.587 --> 02:36.022
what's yours because they're idol stars?

02:38.391 --> 02:40.093
How can you call yourself
a resident assistant?

02:41.294 --> 02:43.763
Oh, right. You lost that position too.

02:48.368 --> 02:49.536
I know it was you

02:50.603 --> 02:52.539
who pulled me out of the movie.

02:55.041 --> 02:56.476
I want to do this film.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.512
What have you gotten out of acting?

03:00.480 --> 03:02.649
Nothing but scathing criticism.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.652
You can go into acting when you get older.

03:09.088 --> 03:10.390
How much older?

03:12.659 --> 03:14.327
How long will our group last?

03:15.628 --> 03:17.430
Three years at most?

03:18.932 --> 03:22.001
The other girls can sing,
so they'll be fine.

03:23.670 --> 03:24.871
But what about me?

03:25.905 --> 03:27.874
Will I end up having to run
an online shopping mall?

03:29.008 --> 03:31.778
That doesn't sound like a bad idea.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.247
Acting is not cut out for you.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.819
What idol doesn't have
their acting criticized at first?

03:39.886 --> 03:41.955
Focus on music, so that
you're not a nuisance to the group.

03:43.089 --> 03:45.725
That comes first, you idiot.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.219
Please leave. This is my room.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.423
Ms. Ahn said we should share this room
for the time being.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.995
I don't even share a room
with my group members.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.131
I can't stand people touching my things.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.306
And it's uncomfortable
to be stared at too.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.676
Then lock the door and live alone.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.647
That's why I'm asking you to leave.

04:46.919 --> 04:47.987
Do you actually...

04:49.889 --> 04:51.224
go to sleep with this thing?

04:51.858 --> 04:54.027
Yes. Why?

04:55.828 --> 04:58.765
Doesn't it make you feel like a pervert?

04:59.399 --> 05:01.567
You're the pervert for even thinking that.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.809
In any case, this is our room too,

05:09.876 --> 05:11.444
so if you're uncomfortable,
you should leave.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.480
Let's go to bed.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.654
Let's go to bed.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.959
What are you doing?

05:36.302 --> 05:37.637
What are you doing?

05:37.704 --> 05:39.038
Go sleep in someone else's room.

05:39.605 --> 05:40.940
I'm sure you have friends.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.784
Creepy stalker.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.356
Do you take your fans as creepy stalkers?

05:56.689 --> 05:58.257
You're nothing without your fans.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.195
Don't touch my stuff.

06:09.268 --> 06:12.438
If you want to be treated
like a princess, go home.

06:13.573 --> 06:14.540
Stop it.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.210
Shall I pack your things for you?

06:17.543 --> 06:19.479
Give me your address.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.592
I told you not to touch my stuff.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.070
How far along are they?
Pulling each other's hair?

06:44.737 --> 06:46.406
They must be about at that point.

06:49.876 --> 06:53.413
-It's quiet in there.
-I'm so curious.

07:07.059 --> 07:08.961
Hae-seong lost.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.431
Did she get beaten up?

07:39.792 --> 07:43.362
Do you think it's okay for them to take
what's yours because they're idol stars?

07:44.030 --> 07:45.865
How can you call yourself
a resident assistant?

07:59.145 --> 08:00.046
Not yet?

08:04.016 --> 08:05.718
My hand went in.

08:05.785 --> 08:09.622
It's lights out soon.
Work faster and unclog it.

08:09.689 --> 08:10.623
Can't you wait outside?

08:10.690 --> 08:13.326
We're not close enough to be watching
something like this together.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.462
We have been working at the same school
for a few years now.

08:17.063 --> 08:18.397
You have changed, though.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.768
The old Ms. Ahn is gone
as soon as the new director came along.

08:23.069 --> 08:26.205
You're not who you used to be.

08:26.873 --> 08:29.775
Don't you know that women
are creatures of change?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.911
Unclog the toilet in ten minutes.

08:33.579 --> 08:34.814
"In ten minutes."

08:35.348 --> 08:36.182
Darn it.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.029
Ta-da.

08:50.863 --> 08:54.200
You'll never run out of bananas
if you keep me around, Mr. Yang.

08:54.734 --> 08:57.837
-What?
-A gift from your new roomie.

08:57.937 --> 09:00.006
We're not roommates. Go home to--

09:04.810 --> 09:06.012
What is it?

09:07.914 --> 09:10.783
How would I know how to fix the lock?

09:10.917 --> 09:11.751
Lock?

09:13.019 --> 09:14.086
Fine.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.391
Does she think
that she can just order me around?

09:19.258 --> 09:22.194
Hey, do I look like a pushover?

09:22.428 --> 09:24.430
What do they take me for?

09:24.997 --> 09:26.566
I know how to fix locks.

09:27.466 --> 09:29.569
I can also unclog a toilet
in three seconds.

09:30.169 --> 09:32.471
I change light bulbs in a flash.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.673
Look.

09:34.273 --> 09:37.176
This caretaker cap
was made for me. Amazing, isn't it?

09:40.479 --> 09:43.683
Should I do all
the caretaker duties in your place?

09:44.684 --> 09:45.952
In return for letting you live here?

10:01.834 --> 10:04.136
I have something to tell you

10:04.570 --> 10:06.539
as the former resident assistant
of this dorm.

10:06.739 --> 10:07.573
What?

10:08.407 --> 10:11.644
Have you ever watched
Dances with Wolves or Avatar?

10:11.811 --> 10:12.778
Why do you ask?

10:13.012 --> 10:16.182
In those movies, the bad guys invade
a peaceful village

10:16.349 --> 10:19.385
and steal houses and land.

10:19.585 --> 10:23.422
They drive out the locals
and kill the Na'vi.

10:23.522 --> 10:24.357
So?

10:25.491 --> 10:29.095
That's exactly what's happening
in our dorm.

10:30.062 --> 10:30.896
Really?

10:32.431 --> 10:35.001
The two movies have something in common.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.670
The characters who come to steal
the local people's land

10:37.737 --> 10:40.773
end up siding with them
and maintain the peace

10:40.840 --> 10:42.074
by putting their lives on the line.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.377
Isn't that moving?

10:46.445 --> 10:47.780
What is it that you want to say?

10:49.148 --> 10:53.953
I would like you to side with us
like those main characters did.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.856
We can't get kicked out
of the dorm like this.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.958
-If you--
-It doesn't concern me,

10:59.258 --> 11:00.660
so deal with it yourselves.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.335
But we got kicked out because of you guys.

11:09.468 --> 11:10.803
I didn't force you out.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.573
Don't you feel
even the least bit responsible?

11:16.042 --> 11:17.710
-Not at all.
-Why not?

11:18.144 --> 11:21.147
But I gave you back the CD
with that naked Russian woman--

11:21.213 --> 11:23.349
I don't feel like talking right now.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.493
Lights out.

11:42.468 --> 11:43.703
PEACE IN THE DORM

11:43.769 --> 11:45.171
GUARDIANS OF THE PEACE IN THE DORM

11:54.947 --> 12:00.453
So, you're the indigenous people,
the Na'vi?

12:01.654 --> 12:04.623
-Yes.
-And I'm the bad guy?

12:05.091 --> 12:07.259
No. I mean...

12:08.227 --> 12:12.131
You seem to have
quite the appetite for conquest.

12:19.004 --> 12:22.408
This isn't something
you should talk to me about.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.477
You should talk to the teacher
in charge of such matters.

12:24.710 --> 12:28.280
We did talk to Principal Ju, but...

12:28.414 --> 12:29.381
What did he say?

12:32.485 --> 12:34.253
What do you want me to do?

12:34.854 --> 12:37.923
It was decided by GPA,
as per school regulations.

12:38.557 --> 12:41.327
You should have worked harder
to keep up your GPAs.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.063
Go!

12:44.897 --> 12:47.366
Principal Ju is right.

12:47.666 --> 12:50.503
But we're no match for professional idols.

12:50.736 --> 12:51.937
This isn't fair.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.374
But you are all students here.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.076
There are no special privileges.

12:57.209 --> 12:58.110
Then let us all...

13:00.045 --> 13:02.515
be evaluated under the same condition.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.585
You said you were no match for them.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.421
Why waste the time and energy?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.625
If you think you can win,
I'll let you have a go at it.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.293
Do you think you can win?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.233
You have been living a sheltered life
in the comfort of this campus.

13:22.902 --> 13:27.306
But this campus is no longer
the safe haven it used to be.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.945
Kids way better than you
are diligently taking classes.

13:33.512 --> 13:36.182
Why are you wasting your time protesting?

13:39.852 --> 13:42.421
You know you get penalty points
for skipping classes, right?

13:43.422 --> 13:47.159
Just so you know, penalty points
pile up faster than spam mail.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.264
Get back to class!

14:00.906 --> 14:03.309
Where did they find such fools?

14:06.579 --> 14:09.648
-About Principal Ju Jeong-wan...
-Yes, sir?

14:10.683 --> 14:14.086
He's letting me have my way.
What do you think?

14:15.421 --> 14:16.956
Can he work hand in glove with me?

14:17.523 --> 14:18.891
We'll have to see.

14:21.727 --> 14:24.029
I should put him to the test to figure out

14:24.230 --> 14:26.265
whether he's a fangless tiger,

14:26.799 --> 14:28.634
or a hyena hiding his fangs.

14:42.481 --> 14:45.651
Where were you all this whole time?

14:47.019 --> 14:50.322
We had a meeting with the director.

14:54.793 --> 14:57.630
-Take your places.
-Yes, Ms. Ahn.

15:01.567 --> 15:06.805
We will now begin training
to increase your lung capacity.

15:07.673 --> 15:08.741
How?

15:10.242 --> 15:11.076
With this.

15:17.182 --> 15:20.486
Ready, set,

15:20.886 --> 15:21.720
go!

15:22.788 --> 15:25.090
You lose when the paper sticks
to your mouth.

15:25.391 --> 15:29.528
Keep breathing out slowly
and consistently.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.931
Working out helps you build muscle.

15:31.997 --> 15:36.402
Similarly, if you continue this,
your lung capacity will increase.

15:36.735 --> 15:39.939
Keep that in mind at all times.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.942
So, what should you do
with this breathing exercise?

15:44.476 --> 15:46.278
Make it a habit.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.618
Out.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.495
Out.

16:09.969 --> 16:10.836
Out.

16:17.009 --> 16:17.910
Sucker.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.313
Ms. Ahn, she's not breathing out.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.919
Shin Hae-seong, out.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.951
No wonder you're HershE's main vocalist.

16:59.084 --> 17:00.953
You could become a deep-sea diver.

17:03.655 --> 17:04.823
Na-na is living proof

17:05.257 --> 17:09.028
that breathing is crucial
to singing, right?

17:11.096 --> 17:14.033
-Now, the pail group.
-Yes?

17:14.400 --> 17:18.237
Each of you must work harder
so that you can breathe out

17:18.504 --> 17:22.875
for ten more seconds than now
by the end-of-the-month evaluation.

17:22.975 --> 17:24.343
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

17:25.911 --> 17:29.648
This month, you will be doing duets
for your evaluations.

17:30.082 --> 17:31.617
Each of you needs to find a partner.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.752
Enjoy preparing for the evaluation.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.558
The evaluation this month
will be comparable

17:40.125 --> 17:42.995
to a professional concert.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.749
-Hi, Mom.
-Hey, phones aren't allowed!

18:05.350 --> 18:08.353
If you don't think it's fair,
carry your cell phone around too.

18:09.955 --> 18:11.657
I can't talk right now.
I'll call you later.

18:11.723 --> 18:12.658
Bye.

18:13.158 --> 18:15.994
I need to film that brat
and put it up on the Internet.

18:17.162 --> 18:20.532
She acts like an angel
in front of cameras.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.138
Right?

18:30.075 --> 18:32.344
Who are you going to partner up with
for that monthly evaluation?

18:32.911 --> 18:35.547
Me? With Hae-seong, of course.

18:35.914 --> 18:39.952
-"Of course."
-The idol teams will crush us.

18:41.186 --> 18:42.855
It's not like they're all good.

18:42.921 --> 18:44.456
There's Rian, for one.

18:44.823 --> 18:48.894
-We're much better than her.
-Are we?

18:49.695 --> 18:52.998
She's in for an embarrassment.

18:53.832 --> 18:54.700
-Why?
-Why?

18:55.501 --> 18:57.369
There are three members in HershE.

18:57.569 --> 19:00.739
The other two members
won't want to pair up with Rian.

19:01.173 --> 19:03.542
And Rian can't carry a tune
without Na-na and Ailee.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.344
-I know.
-You're right.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.279
-Let's go.
-Okay.

19:07.713 --> 19:08.647
Come on.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.553
My goodness.

19:27.833 --> 19:28.967
Pick that up for me.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.504
Can't you hear me?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.512
You told me not to touch your stuff.

19:40.579 --> 19:42.381
How childish.

19:48.153 --> 19:50.956
I know I'm childish,
but I think you're worse.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.326
Hey!

19:58.864 --> 19:59.998
Gosh.

20:05.470 --> 20:06.505
Come down.

20:09.908 --> 20:12.411
-What's going on?
-It's Mr. Lee.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.181
PROVIDED BY OZ ENTERTAINMENT

20:16.248 --> 20:18.717
The mirror's dirty.
You need to keep it clean.

20:27.426 --> 20:30.762
-Don't push.
-What are you doing?

20:30.829 --> 20:31.930
-Hello, everyone.
-Quiet, guys.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.133
I'm Lee Gang-cheol,
the director of Kirin's board.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.205
Some students have claimed

20:40.505 --> 20:42.474
that the recent room assignment
was unfair.

20:43.308 --> 20:47.579
We will redo the room assignment,
as we respect your opinions

20:47.913 --> 20:51.984
and aim to run Kirin Art School
in a transparent manner.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.489
He never changes, does he?
He still loves being on TV.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.925
The outcome of our monthly evaluation

20:59.992 --> 21:02.594
will determine room assignments
in the dorm.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.596
To ensure impartiality,

21:05.330 --> 21:09.301
Principal Ju Jeong-wan
will be doing the evaluations.

21:12.137 --> 21:12.971
Me?

21:15.173 --> 21:18.210
You did it! It's good news!

21:21.313 --> 21:22.948
You did it, Shin Hae-seong!

21:23.148 --> 21:25.917
No wonder you were a resident assistant.

21:26.585 --> 21:28.854
Oh, stop. We all went
and talked to him together.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.223
Still, it's all thanks to you.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.692
When you suggested
the feather headdresses,

21:33.759 --> 21:35.127
I thought you were crazy.

21:35.193 --> 21:37.629
But it worked. This is great.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.499
What should we sing?

21:40.699 --> 21:43.335
What? Us?

21:43.435 --> 21:47.205
For the evaluation.
What's a good duet song?

21:47.572 --> 21:50.042
My strong vocals really need
to come out this time.

21:51.176 --> 21:53.178
Actually, I am...

21:56.181 --> 21:58.016
I'm teaming up with Yu-jin.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.819
What? But earlier, in the bathroom--

22:00.919 --> 22:02.421
I might get kicked out of the dorm

22:02.487 --> 22:04.089
if I don't take this seriously.

22:04.856 --> 22:06.858
Good luck to the both of us.

22:07.592 --> 22:08.493
Excuse me.

22:09.561 --> 22:12.397
How can she call herself a friend?

22:13.365 --> 22:16.635
I let her into my life
despite our religious differences.

22:17.602 --> 22:20.205
She shouldn't be doing this to me, right?

22:28.447 --> 22:32.017
The end-of-the-month evaluation
will be comparable to a showcase.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.819
Don't let your guard down.
Practice diligently.

22:34.152 --> 22:36.021
This is our first major event
since coming to Kirin.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.089
Got it?

22:37.856 --> 22:40.392
It's like being a trainee again.

22:41.393 --> 22:42.928
I told you.

22:43.228 --> 22:46.498
We're running the school just like
how we run the trainee program at Oz.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.202
-You're teaming up with Si-u, right?
-Yes.

22:51.503 --> 22:54.506
I'm looking for him too,
so let's keep trying.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.709
It looks like he's about to cause
another major incident, doesn't it?

22:58.877 --> 22:59.711
Yes.

23:00.579 --> 23:01.913
What about you girls?

23:04.416 --> 23:06.952
Should we do the duet we did
when we were trainees?

23:08.687 --> 23:11.423
Let's think about it. We don't necessarily
have to pair up together.

23:12.457 --> 23:13.759
You're not doing the duet with me?

23:16.895 --> 23:19.264
I need to watch the TV drama
to see how I did.

23:24.469 --> 23:25.971
All right. You're excused.

23:31.943 --> 23:32.978
Let's duet.

23:36.481 --> 23:37.682
We'll now begin...

23:40.285 --> 23:42.187
taking bids for our very own Hong-ju.

23:52.798 --> 23:53.899
What's the starting bid?

23:54.099 --> 23:55.367
This is Hong-ju we're talking about.

23:57.569 --> 23:58.770
Let's start with ten meal tickets.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.142
-You.
-Ten meal tickets.

24:04.376 --> 24:06.645
That's only the starting bid.

24:07.012 --> 24:12.717
Whoever picks Park Hong-ju
will come out on top at the evaluation.

24:13.251 --> 24:14.953
If you want to do the duet
with Park Hong-ju,

24:15.220 --> 24:16.955
make your bids now.

24:17.088 --> 24:19.291
Here!

24:19.357 --> 24:21.293
-You.
-I bid 20 meal tickets.

24:21.993 --> 24:23.762
You're bidding 20 meal tickets?
Are you kidding me?

24:25.163 --> 24:26.631
Here!

24:27.933 --> 24:29.734
-You.
-I bid 25 meal tickets.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.736
Come on, what's the difference?

24:37.409 --> 24:38.343
I bid ten more.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.181
No. We need something better than that.

24:43.415 --> 24:44.883
Who else?

24:45.984 --> 24:48.420
-What are they doing?
-I bid 50 meal tickets.

24:50.055 --> 24:51.790
No, that won't do.

24:51.857 --> 24:54.025
I think they're picking partners
for the duet.

24:55.794 --> 24:57.863
I bid 50 meal tickets,

24:58.330 --> 24:59.931
and you can have me as your slave.

25:02.801 --> 25:04.536
No, we need something better.

25:04.603 --> 25:07.038
Is this the best
that Kirin students can do?

25:09.608 --> 25:13.245
On top of everything she offered,
I'll set you up with ten different girls.

25:20.118 --> 25:23.221
I'll throw in all my CDs,

25:23.822 --> 25:25.557
plus all the conditions
of the previous bid.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.197
Good enough?

25:32.597 --> 25:34.232
Okay. Is that it? No more bids?

25:34.299 --> 25:38.837
All right then.
We're about to go with Hae-seong's bid.

25:43.108 --> 25:44.075
This is your last chance.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.778
May I join the bid?

25:57.422 --> 25:59.724
I'll wager my voice.

28:18.830 --> 28:19.998
So, what do you say?

28:20.665 --> 28:21.666
Sold!

28:32.777 --> 28:36.648
-Why are you sulking?
-I'm not.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.349
Yes, you are.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.652
I want to sing with you too.

28:41.019 --> 28:42.187
But what about Rian?

28:42.520 --> 28:45.223
If we pair up, she'll feel left out.

28:47.459 --> 28:48.727
Fine.

28:52.497 --> 28:55.567
But she won't even thank you
for being thoughtful.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.042
Mister!

29:06.845 --> 29:10.315
"Mister"? You can't address
our director like that.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.250
That's very rude of you.

29:12.383 --> 29:13.952
I just don't get it.

29:14.486 --> 29:17.255
Her tempo was off and both her head voice

29:17.322 --> 29:19.557
and chest voice were awful.

29:20.391 --> 29:23.228
Didn't you catch that?

29:24.462 --> 29:27.165
I'm sure you didn't. Had you caught that,
you definitely would've failed her.

29:27.966 --> 29:30.502
She just tagged along with me.

29:30.568 --> 29:34.773
She is... She's nothing.

29:35.073 --> 29:38.676
I'm first-rate while she's so third-rate.

29:40.011 --> 29:41.045
This is precisely why

29:41.379 --> 29:44.282
EUN-JUNG SHOULD BE THE MAIN CHARACTER

29:44.349 --> 29:46.184
RIAN, YOUR ACTING SUCKS

29:46.251 --> 29:48.787
EVEN THE GUM SHE'S CHEWING
WOULD DO BETTER THAN HER

29:48.853 --> 29:49.921
DREAM HIGH MAKES ME CRINGE

29:49.988 --> 29:51.956
NO IDOL IS THIS BAD AN ACTOR.
ARE YOU READING THIS, RIAN?

29:52.023 --> 29:53.691
WATCHING YOU ACT IS FUNNIER
THAN A COMEDY SHOW

29:58.563 --> 30:01.332
-Are you monitoring your acting?
-Yes.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.068
You don't look so happy.

30:04.769 --> 30:05.937
Did it turn out bad again?

30:09.674 --> 30:11.409
No. My own acting moved me.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.949
Don't you ever check
the viewers' comment board?

30:18.650 --> 30:21.452
I would like to, but we're not allowed
to use the Internet.

30:22.353 --> 30:24.088
Since when have you been
a stickler for the rules?

30:25.223 --> 30:26.124
Do you

30:26.991 --> 30:28.426
still have feelings for me?

30:28.660 --> 30:29.494
What?

30:30.929 --> 30:32.931
You're trying to pick a fight with me
like a child.

30:34.365 --> 30:37.802
I'm not the type to follow the rules,
but you are not.

30:39.270 --> 30:42.040
Dating is not allowed here.

30:51.449 --> 30:53.751
Hey! Let me use the mirror.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.293
What's with the stage makeup?

31:04.329 --> 31:05.530
I can hear you.

31:20.478 --> 31:23.314
-Did you use my perfume?
-No.

31:23.815 --> 31:27.518
Yes, you did. The cap's not on properly.

31:27.785 --> 31:29.554
You must not have closed it properly.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.168
Why are you sniffing me
like a drug detection dog?

31:44.502 --> 31:46.337
You smell like my perfume.

31:48.473 --> 31:53.244
You can have this, but don't use
my things from now on, okay?

31:54.779 --> 31:56.281
What do you take me for?

31:56.581 --> 32:00.652
Hey, I don't know how great this stuff is,

32:00.718 --> 32:02.253
but I don't want your things.

32:03.488 --> 32:04.322
Why?

32:04.989 --> 32:07.692
Is it more fun to sneak around?

32:09.027 --> 32:12.230
Be careful. You might need
to get your head checked for that.

32:16.901 --> 32:17.802
Hi, Mom.

32:19.637 --> 32:21.205
Hang up. We need to talk.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.474
Hey!

32:24.842 --> 32:25.910
They called?

32:27.679 --> 32:28.513
What did they say?

32:30.949 --> 32:31.783
Today?

32:34.786 --> 32:37.322
No, today's fine.

32:47.231 --> 32:51.202
We wanted to make her an actress.

32:51.769 --> 32:55.073
They said she should make her debut
as a singer to make herself known,

32:55.239 --> 32:57.308
so we thought it would just be temporary,

32:58.109 --> 33:01.579
but they've been making her sing and dance
all over the stage in absurdly high heels.

33:03.147 --> 33:06.985
It breaks my heart every time
I see her on stage.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.823
Her acting talent's going to waste.

33:11.889 --> 33:13.992
Please, Mom.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.497
My mom's a bit protective of me.

33:22.867 --> 33:26.471
If I switch agencies,
you'll tie up all the loose ends, right?

33:26.738 --> 33:28.539
Yes. Just leave that to us.

33:29.207 --> 33:32.343
Make your decision,
and we'll take care of everything else.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.912
We'll make sure this doesn't tarnish
Rian's public persona.

33:37.382 --> 33:38.616
Hello, President Hong.

33:39.717 --> 33:40.685
Oh, hi.

33:42.587 --> 33:43.421
Long time no see.

33:43.554 --> 33:44.589
What's a reporter doing here?

33:45.556 --> 33:47.158
I must be interrupting.

33:47.225 --> 33:48.893
No. We're all done here.

33:50.161 --> 33:51.396
Let's get going.

34:26.964 --> 34:28.366
This is one of Si-u's favorite joints.

34:28.433 --> 34:30.601
Go and bring him back, okay?

34:41.612 --> 34:44.649
Just leave me alone. You're just a minor.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.151
What's the matter with you?

34:48.453 --> 34:51.756
I was the most searched person
on the Internet today.

34:54.425 --> 34:57.695
See? "Shin Mi-so is a two-timer."

34:58.763 --> 35:01.232
The next most searched term
was "Shin Mi-so's sugar daddy"

35:01.432 --> 35:02.867
followed by "Kim Hui-jun."

35:04.735 --> 35:09.240
They say I'm the mistress of the son
of that company owner I did an ad for.

35:10.842 --> 35:13.010
Yet I met him only once
at a company dinner.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.513
This stuff happens all the time.

35:18.216 --> 35:19.984
Just because you get hit every day

35:20.952 --> 35:22.520
doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.990
Then take legal action.

35:28.559 --> 35:30.094
What did your agency say?

35:31.062 --> 35:32.463
They told me to lay low.

35:33.064 --> 35:36.767
They told me to keep my mouth shut
and stay home.

35:40.505 --> 35:42.206
I think they're going to drop me.

35:45.042 --> 35:46.844
I'm only 22 years old.

35:49.113 --> 35:50.448
How am I supposed to go on?

35:56.287 --> 35:57.655
I should never have become a singer.

36:28.286 --> 36:30.288
GUITAR LESSONS

36:30.354 --> 36:33.491
CURRENTLY A MUSIC STUDENT
AT KOREA UNIVERSITY OF ARTS

38:09.887 --> 38:13.457
Thank you. Don't forget to call.

38:13.858 --> 38:17.628
Thank you. Here you go. Thanks.

38:28.072 --> 38:29.507
Is that it?

38:31.275 --> 38:32.710
Don't you know any other songs?

38:34.478 --> 38:35.313
You...

38:39.350 --> 38:40.651
Sing a different song.

38:41.519 --> 38:43.087
I don't sing for just anyone.

38:44.255 --> 38:45.089
Leave.

38:46.624 --> 38:49.093
Am I just anyone?

38:54.498 --> 38:55.666
I'll play one more song,

38:56.534 --> 38:58.269
a song that's unique and soulful.

38:58.869 --> 39:01.072
I will not emulate others this time.

39:10.281 --> 39:14.051
-Look! It's JB! May I have your autograph?
-It's JB!

39:14.552 --> 39:15.653
I love you!

39:22.927 --> 39:24.795
Oh, my god! JB!

39:28.966 --> 39:31.035
You're so handsome!

39:33.204 --> 39:35.573
-Oh, my!
-Your autograph!

39:36.340 --> 39:39.043
-Can I get your autograph?
-Please?

39:40.077 --> 39:40.911
Thank you.

40:03.501 --> 40:04.969
Give me that camera.

40:10.274 --> 40:11.175
Run.

40:12.209 --> 40:13.077
Shit.

40:16.480 --> 40:17.381
Stop!

40:19.850 --> 40:21.018
Stop!

40:22.486 --> 40:23.554
Stop!

40:23.621 --> 40:25.256
What's it with him?

40:40.004 --> 40:42.807
If you want pictures of me, pay for them.

40:45.075 --> 40:48.145
Then again, my hourly rate is higher
than your annual salary.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.080
You bastard!

40:57.488 --> 41:00.591
Isn't it fraud to give lessons by lying
about your educational background?

41:02.026 --> 41:03.994
Come on. I was just having some fun.

41:05.596 --> 41:06.597
Some fun?

41:09.433 --> 41:12.903
You ruined my performance.
You call that "having some fun"?

41:13.337 --> 41:15.606
You said you didn't sing for just anyone.

41:16.607 --> 41:21.011
I wanted to let you know
that I'm not just anyone.

41:22.413 --> 41:23.614
Forget it.

41:24.615 --> 41:26.217
I shouldn't even bother
with the likes of you.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.120
This bastard.

41:30.187 --> 41:32.490
Do you have any idea how much that was?

41:35.025 --> 41:36.227
What are you going to do about it?

41:37.328 --> 41:39.997
Hey, I just asked you a damn question!

41:40.164 --> 41:42.366
Don't get yourself involved.

41:43.200 --> 41:46.237
Isn't he your friend?
Isn't he in your group?

41:46.504 --> 41:48.205
You want to be
the self-righteous one, don't you?

42:01.218 --> 42:03.120
-Get up, you--
-Hey.

42:05.990 --> 42:06.991
Are you two...

42:08.926 --> 42:10.261
ganging up on one guy?

42:12.796 --> 42:14.798
Don't cause trouble. Just go.

42:15.799 --> 42:18.235
And don't you dare call the cops.

42:27.511 --> 42:28.712
We're not done here yet.

42:31.582 --> 42:32.416
You brat.

42:35.286 --> 42:37.788
You're JB, aren't you?

42:40.758 --> 42:45.663
Idols should be more careful
about their public image, no?

42:50.634 --> 42:52.436
Don't you dare touch me
with your dirty hands.

42:53.537 --> 42:55.205
Didn't you say not to
get involved a second ago?

42:56.740 --> 42:59.109
I don't care if you're JB. You little...

43:01.512 --> 43:03.113
Damn it.

43:10.454 --> 43:11.989
Who the hell are you?

43:22.766 --> 43:23.834
Do you have a partner...

43:31.842 --> 43:35.779
Would you like to do the duet with me?

43:35.846 --> 43:38.382
What? Well, sorry.

43:40.951 --> 43:42.720
Oh. You must already have a partner.

43:44.088 --> 43:46.023
Oh, it's not that.

43:46.957 --> 43:48.525
Hey! Rian.

43:49.560 --> 43:54.665
If you don't have a partner yet,
would you like to do the duet with me?

43:59.136 --> 44:01.472
-Hi.
-Hi.

44:01.905 --> 44:02.740
What?

44:03.240 --> 44:05.843
Do you have a partner yet?

44:17.087 --> 44:19.690
LEARN TO SING IN THREE OCTAVES!

44:23.494 --> 44:27.164
Hang on. Rian. It's me, Sun-dong.

44:27.698 --> 44:30.801
Rian. Open the door. It's me.

44:37.675 --> 44:38.876
Can you also leave?

44:38.942 --> 44:42.179
Don't you get tired of repeating yourself?

44:43.547 --> 44:46.216
I want to be alone.
Go and sleep in someone else's room.

44:47.184 --> 44:49.586
I'm not going anywhere,

44:49.787 --> 44:51.422
so don't tell me what to do.

44:54.291 --> 44:55.426
This is so shitty.

44:56.393 --> 44:57.227
What?

44:59.396 --> 45:00.898
What did you just say?

45:05.135 --> 45:06.870
Do you think everyone is beneath you?

45:08.038 --> 45:09.640
I'm tired. Don't talk to me.

45:09.940 --> 45:11.442
Being an idol doesn't make you special.

45:11.675 --> 45:13.377
It's not even like you're any good.

45:14.745 --> 45:17.047
It's not like you're any better.

45:17.181 --> 45:19.283
But shouldn't you be better than me?

45:19.583 --> 45:22.820
Are you saying I'm not?

45:25.255 --> 45:27.891
My uncle's not particularly book-smart,

45:28.258 --> 45:30.694
but he studied for the bar exam
until he was over 30.

45:31.528 --> 45:33.831
He ended up trying to kill himself,

45:35.065 --> 45:36.333
and now he's just bumming around.

45:37.267 --> 45:39.803
Why are you telling me about your uncle?

45:40.104 --> 45:44.208
It's just that you remind me of him.

45:46.543 --> 45:50.547
You're not good enough to be a trainee
at any agency out there.

45:51.181 --> 45:53.383
I don't think big dreams are good for you.

45:54.284 --> 45:56.920
I think what you really need to do...

45:57.788 --> 45:58.856
is give up.

46:00.257 --> 46:02.059
You need a reality check.

46:03.494 --> 46:07.865
Look, stuck-up idols like you
need a good beating.

46:07.965 --> 46:09.399
Words don't get through to you, do they?

46:09.566 --> 46:12.136
Fighting cramps my style.

46:12.803 --> 46:14.204
Let go, or I'll make you.

46:14.838 --> 46:16.940
You worry about cramping your style
when you're fighting?

46:17.608 --> 46:19.476
What style is there to cramp?

46:19.576 --> 46:20.878
Why not show your stuff?

46:21.078 --> 46:21.912
Hey!

46:54.411 --> 46:56.613
Oh, my goodness. What are you doing here?

46:59.216 --> 47:04.788
Ms. Ahn, couldn't you let us stay here
for just one night?

47:15.299 --> 47:16.133
Stars?

47:18.869 --> 47:20.904
They look nice from far away, but...

47:35.686 --> 47:36.653
Hello?

47:41.225 --> 47:42.926
Hey, isn't that JB?

47:46.129 --> 47:49.766
Could you open the front entrance
of the dorm for me in five minutes?

47:50.667 --> 47:51.501
Yes.

47:54.938 --> 47:56.306
-Thanks.
-Hang on.

47:56.907 --> 47:57.774
Sure.

47:59.810 --> 48:00.711
NUMBER DELETED

48:01.979 --> 48:05.749
-Thank you.
-Could I take a picture with you?

48:06.250 --> 48:08.652
I'm sorry. Now is not a good time...

48:09.353 --> 48:10.687
Oh, okay.

48:22.499 --> 48:24.167
All done.

48:33.176 --> 48:34.011
Who is it?

48:41.718 --> 48:42.586
What are you doing here?

48:42.853 --> 48:45.889
It may be past curfew, but still,
it's not appropriate for you to be here.

48:45.956 --> 48:48.225
-You violated curfew yourself.
-Hey.

48:48.392 --> 48:51.161
-Just come.
-Let go of me.

48:51.728 --> 48:52.796
Focus the light on the floor.

49:05.442 --> 49:06.710
Much better.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.314
Did you get into a fight?

49:13.684 --> 49:16.720
You must have been studying your butt off.

49:18.288 --> 49:19.623
I had to. I was stressed.

49:22.693 --> 49:25.595
I solved a few math problems
to relieve stress.

49:25.729 --> 49:28.265
You relieve stress
by solving math problems?

49:29.032 --> 49:30.033
Don't you get more stressed?

49:34.471 --> 49:37.841
If there were a museum of humans,
you would be on exhibit.

49:39.543 --> 49:41.178
You're one of a kind.

49:50.253 --> 49:51.088
What?

50:03.967 --> 50:04.835
Hey.

50:05.736 --> 50:08.905
Wouldn't women normally
offer to cook ramen?

50:10.407 --> 50:12.709
Ramen noodles are best uncooked.

50:16.213 --> 50:17.748
I'll gain weight if I eat any more.

50:19.016 --> 50:19.916
Whatever.

50:25.122 --> 50:27.924
How are things going with Sun-dong?

50:28.091 --> 50:30.394
-What do you mean?
-The duet.

50:32.829 --> 50:34.831
I would be out of my mind
to do a duet with her.

50:35.198 --> 50:39.069
Then who's your partner?

50:41.872 --> 50:42.706
Hey.

50:44.741 --> 50:45.642
Would you like to...

50:47.778 --> 50:49.846
This is so salty. So salty.

50:50.814 --> 50:53.817
See? I told you not to dump
the flavoring powder on there.

50:54.684 --> 50:55.652
Here. It's a big one.

51:04.461 --> 51:08.098
I don't get why guys get into fights,
knowing they'll get beaten up.

51:08.632 --> 51:10.600
Are you saying I got beaten up?

51:10.667 --> 51:12.135
The guys I beat up have broken bones.

51:12.202 --> 51:14.204
They had to call 911.

51:15.338 --> 51:16.473
Okay, good job.

51:18.575 --> 51:20.410
What are you doing?

51:20.577 --> 51:22.012
Hold still.

51:22.212 --> 51:24.214
I'm doing this because you look ghastly.

51:55.612 --> 51:56.480
All done.

51:58.448 --> 52:01.184
-Take it easy.
-What? Okay.

52:07.324 --> 52:08.191
By the way,

52:09.459 --> 52:12.796
-thanks for the advice.
-What?

52:13.463 --> 52:17.134
About people taking
what's rightfully mine...

52:18.201 --> 52:19.202
You were right.

52:21.771 --> 52:24.274
I won't let them take what's mine.

52:25.208 --> 52:28.044
I'll prove it to them with my skills
and protect what is...

52:29.846 --> 52:30.680
rightfully mine.

52:56.540 --> 52:58.875
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

54:03.473 --> 54:04.841
What are you doing?

54:06.343 --> 54:07.244
Are you...

54:07.978 --> 54:10.113
-into men?
-What?

54:12.115 --> 54:15.518
You can't like me, okay?

54:16.753 --> 54:19.222
And could you put a shirt on?

54:19.289 --> 54:20.890
What is he talking about?

54:26.496 --> 54:29.032
Shin Hae-seong, that nutjob!

54:29.599 --> 54:32.669
Do you know what time it is?
Hurry up. Double-time.

54:33.903 --> 54:34.738
Run.

54:37.140 --> 54:39.242
-Chop-chop.
-Good morning.

54:42.212 --> 54:43.880
-Hello, Principal Ju.
-Hi.

54:44.180 --> 54:45.749
Excuse me. You can't park there.

54:45.815 --> 54:46.650
Mister.

54:47.684 --> 54:48.518
You...

54:52.922 --> 54:54.424
May I help you?

54:55.025 --> 54:58.528
Is there a senior student
named Jin Yu-jin here?

54:59.629 --> 55:01.698
Oh, boy.

55:04.868 --> 55:06.136
What did Yu-jin do?

55:07.704 --> 55:09.906
-Guys, make way.
-What the...

55:10.807 --> 55:11.641
Hey.

55:12.809 --> 55:13.943
We have a big problem.

55:16.613 --> 55:18.181
-Is it really Yu-jin?
-Really?

55:18.915 --> 55:20.750
-Is that for real?
-Oh, wow.

55:20.917 --> 55:22.786
DISCIPLINARY ACTION
LEE SI-U AND JIN YU-JIN, SUSPENDED

55:22.852 --> 55:23.987
How could this happen?

55:25.288 --> 55:27.157
-He got suspended.
-There was an assault.

55:27.223 --> 55:29.192
-Really?
-Si-u was involved.

55:29.259 --> 55:31.494
I:DN MEMBER SI-U EMBROILED
IN ANOTHER ASSAULT CASE

55:39.102 --> 55:40.270
Damn it!

55:41.571 --> 55:44.941
I thought he realized his mistakes. Why do
I have to read comments about him here?

55:47.243 --> 55:50.647
This username here,
"Dishonorable Yi Sun-sin."

55:50.714 --> 55:52.849
Report him to Cyber Crime Investigation.

55:53.817 --> 55:55.618
Flamers should know their limits.

55:56.586 --> 55:59.155
And look at his ID. "Dishonorable
Yi Sun-sin" is just so disgraceful.

55:59.723 --> 56:02.125
I checked JB and Si-u into a hospital.

56:02.625 --> 56:05.328
If there's an issue, we need to make
JB and Si-u look like the victims.

56:05.495 --> 56:06.796
I blocked the news articles.

56:07.964 --> 56:09.733
What good will blocking them do?

56:11.334 --> 56:13.737
We need to divert the attention
from JB using Si-u.

56:14.971 --> 56:18.141
Tell the press that Si-u's on the verge
of being dropped by Oz.

56:19.442 --> 56:20.276
What?

56:21.544 --> 56:23.279
How will you deal with the repercussions?

56:24.414 --> 56:26.116
Are you really planning to drop him?

56:27.917 --> 56:30.320
Tell him to find a school
he can transfer to.

56:32.922 --> 56:33.923
Mr. Lee...

56:37.227 --> 56:38.495
This isn't fair.

56:38.862 --> 56:41.331
The two of them had ganged up
on a single guy.

56:41.398 --> 56:43.833
-Was I supposed to watch?
-Be quiet. Not a peep.

56:44.234 --> 56:46.236
We're sorry. But from what you told us,

56:46.536 --> 56:50.173
I don't think the matter
warrants a settlement.

56:50.473 --> 56:52.842
Ask JB whether I'm telling the truth.

56:53.276 --> 56:55.412
He has already settled.

56:56.379 --> 56:57.280
Settled?

56:58.648 --> 57:01.184
Why should he give them money?
He was a victim too.

57:02.018 --> 57:02.852
Zip it.

57:03.787 --> 57:05.288
Now, Detective...

57:05.789 --> 57:08.391
You know how it is. Boys at this age

57:08.858 --> 57:12.695
get a surge of hormones,
and they can't control themselves.

57:12.762 --> 57:14.497
You do understand, right? We're so sorry.

57:15.031 --> 57:17.500
I think I relayed everything I needed to.

57:17.600 --> 57:19.536
When we're in contact again,
have him come in.

57:20.236 --> 57:21.471
I'll do that, Detective.

57:21.871 --> 57:22.739
Gosh.

57:23.740 --> 57:25.575
-Yes?
-Will you come with him?

57:25.909 --> 57:29.913
-Pardon?
-I used to be a Galaxy fan.

57:30.780 --> 57:33.283
-Oh! You recognized me.
-Yes.

57:33.349 --> 57:35.051
Let's have a drink sometime.

57:35.118 --> 57:37.053
-That would be great.
-Thank you so much.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.055
-Thank you.
-See you again.

57:39.656 --> 57:41.157
We ask for your kind understanding.

57:48.097 --> 57:48.965
Darn it.

57:56.773 --> 57:58.641
-What's this?
-Don't touch it.

57:59.509 --> 58:01.711
What is it? I have never seen this before.

58:03.279 --> 58:06.483
-It must be new.
-I told you not to touch it.

58:06.850 --> 58:08.551
I touch what I want to.

58:11.187 --> 58:12.489
This must have cost an arm and a leg.

58:12.755 --> 58:13.790
Oh, my.

58:17.327 --> 58:18.828
Do you threaten classmates for money?

58:18.928 --> 58:21.297
-What?
-Don't do that, okay?

58:24.734 --> 58:26.035
The sound is amazing.

58:29.072 --> 58:30.940
I like this a lot.
I'll use it for a while.

58:31.074 --> 58:34.177
-I'm confiscating it for now.
-Principal Ju!

58:35.612 --> 58:38.948
I'm your principal, so listen.
This is a warning.

58:39.516 --> 58:42.218
Stay out of trouble
if you want to graduate.

58:42.852 --> 58:45.255
What will you do if you get kicked out?

58:45.522 --> 58:47.690
Sing on the street with your guitar?

58:48.358 --> 58:49.425
Give me a break.

58:49.792 --> 58:50.727
Confiscated.

58:54.964 --> 58:56.366
WILL OZ ENTERTAINMENT DROP SI-U?

58:56.432 --> 58:59.269
OZ ENTERTAINMENT MIGHT DROP SI-U
WHO GOT INVOLVED IN AN ASSAULT CASE

59:07.143 --> 59:08.211
Is that an article about me?

59:15.785 --> 59:16.819
The agency...

59:18.054 --> 59:19.589
told me to find another school.

59:21.124 --> 59:22.926
It's their way of telling me
they're kicking me out.

59:26.296 --> 59:27.564
Isn't this what you wanted?

59:28.998 --> 59:30.233
You wanted to go solo.

59:35.972 --> 59:36.806
Here.

59:38.675 --> 59:42.445
I didn't know what to do with this,
but I've decided to give it to you.

59:44.047 --> 59:45.014
JEONG UI-BONG, BAD ATTITUDE

59:45.081 --> 59:46.049
JIN YU-JIN, BAD ATTITUDE

59:46.115 --> 59:47.216
SHIN HAE-SEONG, LACK OF TALENT

59:47.283 --> 59:48.484
SI-U, BAD ATTITUDE, OUT OF CONTROL

59:48.551 --> 59:50.320
LIST OF CANDIDATES FOR EXPULSION

59:52.555 --> 59:53.856
My name's on that list.

59:56.559 --> 59:59.562
I knew they were planning to kick me out,
so I was expecting for that day to come.

1:00:00.763 --> 1:00:02.498
But it happened
much sooner than I thought.

1:00:04.033 --> 1:00:05.368
I guess it's for the better.

1:00:07.136 --> 1:00:08.204
Why are you giving this to me?

1:00:09.372 --> 1:00:11.007
I wanted to see your reaction.

1:00:14.344 --> 1:00:15.244
The director

1:00:16.446 --> 1:00:20.116
took over Kirin to reorganize the agency
and kick out the existing Kirin kids--

1:00:20.183 --> 1:00:21.217
What's wrong with that?

1:00:22.652 --> 1:00:23.486
What?

1:00:23.753 --> 1:00:25.888
It is natural for the agency

1:00:26.823 --> 1:00:29.792
to get rid of kids
who aren't doing their jobs.

1:00:31.427 --> 1:00:33.963
Were you hoping
that I would go up against the agency?

1:00:35.598 --> 1:00:37.133
Don't be so emotional.

1:00:38.301 --> 1:00:39.636
You've changed a lot.

1:00:42.505 --> 1:00:44.040
Do you know that?

1:01:04.460 --> 1:01:05.595
What's wrong with change?

1:01:07.563 --> 1:01:10.099
I find it more unfortunate
that some people can't change.

1:01:27.850 --> 1:01:29.852
SI-U, LONG-TIME TROUBLEMAKER!

1:01:30.420 --> 1:01:32.288
They have no mercy.

1:01:33.389 --> 1:01:34.657
How will he make a comeback?

1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:39.095
Hello.

1:01:41.431 --> 1:01:42.465
Hello, sir.

1:01:44.634 --> 1:01:46.736
-Why are you so startled?
-Pardon?

1:01:47.904 --> 1:01:49.038
How's school treating you?

1:01:50.973 --> 1:01:51.841
Fine.

1:01:53.076 --> 1:01:53.910
Rian.

1:01:55.378 --> 1:01:58.247
I know more than you think I know.

1:01:58.981 --> 1:02:00.883
Word gets around, you know?

1:02:02.318 --> 1:02:03.486
If Si-u gets kicked out like this

1:02:04.954 --> 1:02:07.557
he'll have a hard time in this industry.

1:02:08.858 --> 1:02:11.728
If he's unlucky, he might have to leave
showbiz for good.

1:02:13.696 --> 1:02:15.131
I have enough on my mind as it is.

1:02:16.733 --> 1:02:18.568
Don't add on to it, all right?

1:02:21.571 --> 1:02:22.405
I won't.

1:02:32.915 --> 1:02:33.850
Take a seat.

1:02:38.521 --> 1:02:42.158
Whether it's my kids or your kids,

1:02:42.225 --> 1:02:44.527
shouldn't you discuss it with me first

1:02:44.961 --> 1:02:46.496
when it comes to
taking disciplinary action?

1:02:46.562 --> 1:02:48.030
I'm the principal, after all.

1:02:48.498 --> 1:02:49.799
I want to turn this school into

1:02:50.633 --> 1:02:53.669
-Korea's top school of art.
-Right.

1:02:53.736 --> 1:02:57.473
Whether they're your kids or mine,
I'm keeping those who show promise

1:02:58.307 --> 1:02:59.509
and cutting those who don't.

1:02:59.876 --> 1:03:01.244
This is a school.

1:03:01.410 --> 1:03:02.745
It's not an entertainment agency.

1:03:02.879 --> 1:03:05.848
As a school, we should be giving the kids
the time to grow and improve,

1:03:05.915 --> 1:03:07.984
and also protect them.
That's our main duty.

1:03:08.251 --> 1:03:09.085
Look, Jeong-wan.

1:03:10.119 --> 1:03:12.321
Don't torture the kids
with all that dream talk.

1:03:13.422 --> 1:03:17.460
Kids with zero potential are better off
if we tell them to give up.

1:03:17.794 --> 1:03:20.196
They should find their real talents
sooner rather than later.

1:03:20.263 --> 1:03:21.564
You can't just give them hope.

1:03:23.699 --> 1:03:25.635
If they amount to nothing,
will you take care of them?

1:03:26.435 --> 1:03:30.573
It's just that I think
they should be given a chance.

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:32.942
That's why we are having
this evaluation thing.

1:03:35.812 --> 1:03:36.813
Right.

1:03:37.013 --> 1:03:39.148
Our past is our past.

1:03:39.315 --> 1:03:42.018
We should work together
for the sake of this school now.

1:03:43.186 --> 1:03:45.955
So, the evaluation for room assignments...

1:03:46.355 --> 1:03:47.890
Are you doing that
to weed out the bad ones?

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:52.228
Pit one member of a pair
against the other.

1:03:54.230 --> 1:03:55.231
What do you mean?

1:03:56.732 --> 1:03:58.601
It won't be team versus team,

1:03:58.768 --> 1:04:00.570
but each kid will go up
against their duet partner

1:04:00.636 --> 1:04:02.905
and you'll fail one of them.
It's what they do these days.

1:04:04.373 --> 1:04:05.508
But why?

1:04:05.575 --> 1:04:07.176
We're not filming
some kind of survival show.

1:04:07.243 --> 1:04:10.112
It's the least we can do
to get the kids to work harder.

1:04:10.613 --> 1:04:12.949
Kids these days are out of control.

1:04:13.115 --> 1:04:15.184
They won't work hard
unless they feel threatened.

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:16.719
I see.

1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:20.523
If my kids go up against yours,
we all know the outcome.

1:04:20.690 --> 1:04:22.859
My kids may go against each other,

1:04:23.259 --> 1:04:26.028
and who knows,
your kids may win against mine.

1:04:26.729 --> 1:04:28.564
That's why I'm having you
evaluate the performances.

1:04:28.631 --> 1:04:29.799
So, what's the problem?

1:04:36.305 --> 1:04:38.708
Mom?

1:04:39.675 --> 1:04:41.410
Don't contact the president of Aurora.

1:04:42.111 --> 1:04:43.613
I think Mr. Lee knows.

1:04:45.081 --> 1:04:47.149
Don't do it, okay?

1:04:47.617 --> 1:04:49.352
Just look at what's happening to Si-u.

1:04:51.687 --> 1:04:53.756
I may end up just like him.

1:05:12.608 --> 1:05:14.710
You weaseled your way out with money.

1:05:17.013 --> 1:05:18.781
Give them what they want.

1:05:19.515 --> 1:05:20.750
They're relentless.

1:05:21.384 --> 1:05:23.419
You know why I got into that fight
in the first place.

1:05:23.486 --> 1:05:26.022
-Who asked you to butt in?
-What?

1:05:26.489 --> 1:05:28.324
Do you not have the money?

1:05:29.392 --> 1:05:30.526
If that's the case, let me know.

1:05:30.927 --> 1:05:32.128
I can lend you the money.

1:05:34.363 --> 1:05:37.433
You worthless scumbag.
You're such a coward!

1:05:45.841 --> 1:05:47.343
Let's do the duet together.

1:05:49.278 --> 1:05:50.112
What?

1:05:54.050 --> 1:05:55.084
Let's do it together.

1:05:56.585 --> 1:05:57.586
What are you scheming?

1:05:59.088 --> 1:06:00.990
You don't think I'm good enough.

1:06:02.358 --> 1:06:04.393
I want to see how great you are.

1:06:05.861 --> 1:06:06.696
Forget about it.

1:06:09.632 --> 1:06:11.400
You haven't found a partner yet, have you?

1:06:12.835 --> 1:06:14.704
You're in no position to play hardball.

1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:20.743
Plus, I would feel more comfortable
pairing up with you

1:06:21.744 --> 1:06:23.245
than someone I don't know at all.

1:06:25.681 --> 1:06:26.515
Let's do it.
