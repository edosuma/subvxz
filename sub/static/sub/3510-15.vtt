00:32.421 --> 00:37.153
Oh, I had the most exquisite
class this evening.

00:37.228 --> 00:39.345
My students are rehearsing
the boxing scene

00:39.366 --> 00:40.922
from "Who's Afraid
Of Virginia Woolf?"

00:41.160 --> 00:42.850
I'm just glad they
were using your studio

00:42.851 --> 00:44.048
and not my living room.

00:44.901 --> 00:49.474
Oh, you're making me your
fabulous pasta carbonara.

00:49.774 --> 00:51.732
Ohh. You shouldn't have.

00:52.134 --> 00:52.920
I didn't.

00:53.115 --> 00:54.600
Actually, it's for Alexis.

00:54.601 --> 00:56.548
She's just been, you
know, so busy lately.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.528
I thought we'd, uh, reconnect.

00:58.554 --> 01:00.541
- Mm.
- So her favorite dish,

01:00.542 --> 01:03.374
and then a screening of "Saw IV,"
the director's cut.

01:03.637 --> 01:05.752
Uh, I hate to tell you this,
darling, but she won't be here.

01:05.998 --> 01:07.196
What do you mean?
Where else would she be?

01:07.228 --> 01:08.358
She's starting a new internship.

01:09.432 --> 01:10.095
Another one?

01:10.144 --> 01:12.161
She did say she wanted
to try a few things

01:12.162 --> 01:13.601
to find her passion.

01:14.285 --> 01:15.947
It's... 9:00.

01:16.448 --> 01:19.477
What kind of passion is she
finding at this time of night?

01:20.043 --> 01:20.704
Um...

01:21.159 --> 01:23.490
Aha. There. Your better half.

01:23.491 --> 01:24.156
Uh, j--

01:24.157 --> 01:25.639
don't change the subject.

01:26.752 --> 01:28.401
What is this internship exactly?

01:28.758 --> 01:30.963
Richard, Alexis swore
me to secrecy.

01:30.964 --> 01:32.003
Yes, but as her father--

01:32.009 --> 01:33.871
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
My lips are sealed.

01:33.913 --> 01:34.709
Then you won't be using them

01:34.710 --> 01:38.145
to eat my... pasta carbonara.

01:38.782 --> 01:39.906
All right.
Well, let me say this.

01:39.907 --> 01:43.463
This internship has my
personal seal of approval.

01:45.401 --> 01:46.766
That doesn't make
me feel any better.

01:49.114 --> 01:50.951
The truth is, the internship
isn't the problem.

01:51.100 --> 01:52.376
It's the fact, she now
has three of them.

01:52.870 --> 01:53.823
Yeah, well, you
never know, Castle.

01:53.824 --> 01:55.236
This might be the one that
brings the two of you

01:55.237 --> 01:56.492
closer together somehow.

01:57.090 --> 01:58.832
I doubt it.
The best I could hope for now is,

01:58.833 --> 02:00.456
she learns to become more
of an underachiever.

02:00.571 --> 02:02.683
Yeah. Well, I'm sure you'll be
able to give her some tips.

02:03.056 --> 02:03.674
So...

02:04.202 --> 02:05.586
neighbors heard a
hellacious fight,

02:05.587 --> 02:06.580
and then our victim here

02:06.668 --> 02:08.279
sailed out of that
fourth-floor window.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.335
Was that his apartment?

02:09.429 --> 02:11.038
We're checking, but it
doesn't look like it.

02:11.038 --> 02:12.884
Tenants don't recognize him
and he doesn't have any ID.

02:13.381 --> 02:15.471
No ID, but lots
of causes of death.

02:15.735 --> 02:16.976
You mean other than gravity?

02:16.977 --> 02:17.720
Oh, yeah.

02:18.609 --> 02:19.545
See that bullet wound?

02:20.363 --> 02:21.695
So he was shot before he fell?

02:21.927 --> 02:22.732
And stabbed.

02:23.361 --> 02:24.276
Shot and stabbed?

02:24.411 --> 02:25.166
And choked,

02:25.216 --> 02:27.412
and has a pencil jammed
in the side of his neck.

02:27.551 --> 02:30.497
Ah. Gives new meaning
to the term "overkill."

02:31.198 --> 02:32.441
Did anyone see his attacker?

02:32.752 --> 02:33.821
Uh, we're checking
with witnesses,

02:33.822 --> 02:36.104
but I figure that our perp
slipped out of the building

02:36.105 --> 02:37.127
during all the confusion.

02:37.233 --> 02:38.422
All right.
Let's go see what they got.

02:42.470 --> 02:43.395
- Hey, Alexis.
- Hey.

02:45.535 --> 02:46.365
Alexis?

02:47.438 --> 02:48.295
Hey, dad.

02:48.737 --> 02:49.974
What are you doing here?

02:51.456 --> 02:52.030
Is...

02:52.136 --> 02:53.404
is this your new internship?

02:53.712 --> 02:55.422
Dr. Parish agreed to
let me shadow her.

02:55.737 --> 02:56.776
I thought, if I
go to med school,

02:56.777 --> 02:58.862
this will give me a better
grasp of forensic pathology.

02:59.226 --> 03:01.372
I've learned so much
in just two days.

03:01.493 --> 03:02.234
Sweetie...

03:03.445 --> 03:04.641
why wouldn't you tell me?

03:04.780 --> 03:06.267
I guess I was afraid
you'd veto it,

03:06.514 --> 03:08.395
like maybe you'd
think me being here

03:08.396 --> 03:10.015
was invading your territory or--

03:10.016 --> 03:10.723
What?

03:11.551 --> 03:14.268
That's crazy. I wouldn't...
think that.

03:14.356 --> 03:15.007
That's...

03:15.958 --> 03:16.758
this is great.

03:17.512 --> 03:18.605
- Yeah.
- It's--I just--I don't know

03:18.606 --> 03:20.759
if you should be exposed to
crime scenes and dead bodies.

03:20.817 --> 03:21.748
Oh, I'm already used to it.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.443
It's equal parts gross and cool.

03:24.091 --> 03:24.920
I heard that

03:25.011 --> 03:26.278
and I couldn't agree
with you more.

03:26.713 --> 03:28.451
I finally get why
you're into this, dad.

03:29.154 --> 03:30.162
Now I'm into it, too.

03:31.800 --> 03:32.495
That's great.

03:35.896 --> 03:36.619
Great.

03:37.914 --> 03:38.633
My worlds are colliding.

03:39.129 --> 03:40.079
You mean Alexis?

03:40.526 --> 03:41.397
You knew about this?

03:41.568 --> 03:43.169
Come on, Castle.
You're the one who said you wanted

03:43.170 --> 03:45.056
to find a way of spending
more time with her.

03:45.061 --> 03:45.852
Not like this.

03:46.433 --> 03:47.429
This is my thing.

03:47.527 --> 03:48.422
This is our thing.

03:49.301 --> 03:50.785
It's a violation of
church and state.

03:50.787 --> 03:51.509
This would be like me

03:51.510 --> 03:53.416
just showing up at her
school and teaching.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.919
I really think that
you're overreacting.

03:55.956 --> 03:56.857
But what if I'm not?

03:57.523 --> 03:59.994
What if this upsets
the delicate synergy

04:00.045 --> 04:00.976
of our partnership?

04:00.996 --> 04:02.725
What if it undermines
our unit cohesion?

04:02.910 --> 04:04.273
See? Major problem.

04:04.376 --> 04:07.338
- Not that. This.
- That's a lot of blood.

04:07.339 --> 04:09.584
One of our witnesses saw a
man leaving the building.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.548
He was limping.

04:11.268 --> 04:12.425
Our suspect was injured.

04:12.516 --> 04:14.780
And the trail goes that way.

04:17.442 --> 04:19.065
A brutal killer betrayed

04:19.065 --> 04:20.954
by the frailty of his own flesh.

04:21.382 --> 04:24.483
His path revealed by
that most primal stain.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.656
Except the path ends here.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.119
Multiple drops in one spot?

04:29.236 --> 04:31.104
He must have stood
here for a minute.

04:32.378 --> 04:33.254
He got into a car.

04:34.853 --> 04:36.775
Well, if he did, maybe
he got caught on tape.

04:37.750 --> 04:39.876
The first 9-1-1
call came at 8:42,

04:39.877 --> 04:41.691
just after our
victim crash landed.

04:42.638 --> 04:44.187
So our guy probably
made it to the corner

04:44.188 --> 04:45.263
a minute or two later.

04:46.094 --> 04:48.630
Hey. Pretty cool about
Alexis' internship.

04:50.514 --> 04:51.189
Or not.

04:53.020 --> 04:53.690
There.

04:53.717 --> 04:54.545
That's gotta be him.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.223
He's wounded, the
cops are after him,

04:57.224 --> 04:58.404
and he's looking
for a place to go.

05:00.572 --> 05:01.279
He has a hostage.

05:02.477 --> 05:04.080
Track the taxi off the
medallion number,

05:04.081 --> 05:04.946
find out where it went.

05:07.101 --> 05:09.006
NYPD! Let me see your hands!

05:09.307 --> 05:11.388
- NYPD! Hands in the air.
- Get up.

05:11.389 --> 05:12.206
Show us your hands.

05:12.697 --> 05:13.731
Get up. Hands in the air.

05:13.732 --> 05:15.038
Get up. Get up.

05:16.120 --> 05:16.961
Put your hands on your head.

05:19.322 --> 05:20.322
Hands on your head now.

05:21.434 --> 05:22.268
Drop to your knees.

05:29.864 --> 05:30.832
Thomas Gage.

05:32.677 --> 05:35.000
For the record, have I
advised you of your rights?

05:37.180 --> 05:37.739
Yes.

05:38.626 --> 05:40.241
Including your right
to an attorney?

05:41.735 --> 05:42.591
I won't need one.

05:45.861 --> 05:46.839
Do you recognize this man?

05:49.693 --> 05:50.952
Looks like he took a nasty fall.

05:51.335 --> 05:52.529
Well, he had a little help.

05:53.088 --> 05:53.943
Fingerprint evidence

05:53.944 --> 05:57.187
will show that he was
thrown out a window by you.

05:58.106 --> 05:58.773
After which,

05:59.424 --> 06:01.323
you kidnapped Tina
Massey in full view

06:01.324 --> 06:02.251
of a security camera.

06:02.769 --> 06:04.159
Murder, plus kidnapping,
that equals

06:04.160 --> 06:05.974
more years in prison
than you have left.

06:07.260 --> 06:08.276
Unless you cooperate.

06:14.745 --> 06:16.186
Everything that you have on me...

06:17.464 --> 06:18.532
or you think you have...

06:20.093 --> 06:21.227
it's all going away.

06:23.953 --> 06:24.660
And we're done here.

06:28.912 --> 06:30.370
This guy should be
sweating bullets.

06:30.482 --> 06:31.592
This doesn't feel right.

06:31.951 --> 06:33.328
It's like he knows
something we don't.

06:33.437 --> 06:36.071
I want you to pull everything
you can on Thomas Gage.

06:36.084 --> 06:37.721
The problem is, that's
not his real name.

06:38.186 --> 06:39.402
His driver's license is bogus,

06:39.427 --> 06:40.761
and his prints aren't
in the system.

06:40.788 --> 06:43.365
Bottom line is, we have
no idea who this man is.

06:48.159 --> 06:49.719
The guy was super
calm the whole time.

06:50.070 --> 06:51.402
Not big on chitchat either.

06:51.838 --> 06:52.900
His opening line was,

06:52.901 --> 06:54.384
"Get your ass in the cab,
or I'll kill you."

06:54.748 --> 06:56.361
And what about when you went
back to your apartment,

06:56.377 --> 06:57.089
what did he talk about?

06:57.258 --> 06:58.773
After he promised
not to murder me,

06:58.867 --> 07:00.262
he asked me to patch up his leg.

07:00.656 --> 07:01.774
He had a real gash.

07:02.378 --> 07:03.710
Could you tell how
he got the injury?

07:04.094 --> 07:05.508
He said he got
slashed with a knife

07:06.477 --> 07:07.505
while he was killing a guy.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.464
And he admitted that to you?

07:09.801 --> 07:11.175
More like just made
the statement.

07:11.861 --> 07:14.220
And did he say who this guy was

07:14.325 --> 07:15.517
or why he killed him?

07:15.881 --> 07:18.419
All he told me was that
the man doesn't exist.

07:20.509 --> 07:22.209
The man doesn't exist

07:22.210 --> 07:23.338
as far as I can tell.

07:23.546 --> 07:24.817
So you haven't IDed him yet?

07:24.898 --> 07:26.535
Look, I'm trying, but
his fingerprints

07:26.536 --> 07:28.195
aren't in any database,
which is weird,

07:28.196 --> 07:30.264
because I thought for sure he'd
have a criminal record.

07:30.280 --> 07:30.983
How come?

07:31.006 --> 07:32.749
It's not the first time
this guy has mixed it up--

07:32.750 --> 07:33.936
old gunshot wounds,

07:33.937 --> 07:35.763
callused hands from
martial arts training,

07:35.764 --> 07:37.619
more broken bones
than evel knievel.

07:37.620 --> 07:38.990
You're not gonna
believe his X-rays.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.312
Where is my John Doe?

07:48.129 --> 07:49.319
Where is my John Doe?

07:50.557 --> 07:51.788
He was right there when I left.

07:52.373 --> 07:53.572
I-I was only gone a minute.

07:53.625 --> 07:55.209
I know he was right there.

07:55.210 --> 07:56.644
I was just about
to cut him open.

07:57.030 --> 07:59.734
Well, now he really
doesn't exist.

08:00.475 --> 08:02.801
How does a body just
vanish from a morgue?

08:02.860 --> 08:04.914
I don't know, but
Thomas Gage does.

08:05.187 --> 08:05.950
Remember what he said--

08:05.951 --> 08:07.412
whatever you think you
have is going away?

08:08.109 --> 08:08.913
He's in on this.

08:09.248 --> 08:11.406
Espo, did Gage get transferred
to central booking yet?

08:11.483 --> 08:12.420
No, he's still in holding.

08:12.683 --> 08:13.801
He's gonna give us some answers.

08:20.429 --> 08:21.188
Where the hell is he?

08:25.967 --> 08:26.998
He was here. I-I--

08:27.263 --> 08:28.404
I secured him myself.

08:30.780 --> 08:31.696
Lock down the precinct.

08:32.092 --> 08:32.768
All right. Move.

08:47.271 --> 08:47.919
Hey, dad.

08:48.806 --> 08:51.494
I tried to wait up, but you must
have gotten in really late.

08:51.596 --> 08:54.189
Not by choice.
Our suspect pulled a Houdini,

08:54.190 --> 08:56.188
so they locked down
the entire station.

08:56.687 --> 08:58.519
But by then, the
mysterious steely killer,

08:58.546 --> 09:00.828
going by the nom de
guerre of Thomas Gage,

09:01.411 --> 09:02.336
was long gone.

09:03.662 --> 09:04.902
I'm writing up notes
on this case.

09:04.903 --> 09:06.692
Solid-gold material
for my next book.

09:06.701 --> 09:07.268
Wait.

09:07.269 --> 09:09.223
The guy who threw John Doe
out the window, he escaped?

09:09.224 --> 09:11.400
Uh-huh, but only after

09:11.682 --> 09:13.763
orchestrating the theft
of John Doe's body

09:13.764 --> 09:14.597
from the morgue.

09:15.273 --> 09:16.102
How awesome is that?

09:16.142 --> 09:17.969
Not so awesome if you're the
person who let it happen.

09:18.339 --> 09:19.538
Oh, honey, it's not your fault.

09:19.539 --> 09:21.704
I was with that body,
but a friend called,

09:21.705 --> 09:23.121
and I stepped away to talk.
I didn't--

09:23.122 --> 09:24.928
Okay, hang on. Listen to me.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.161
I'm glad you weren't there

09:27.576 --> 09:29.867
because the kind of person
who took John Doe's body

09:30.123 --> 09:32.118
is the kind of person who
wouldn't think twice

09:32.119 --> 09:33.510
about hurting whoever
got in the way.

09:34.047 --> 09:35.915
Still, I thought working
with Dr. Parish,

09:35.916 --> 09:37.606
there'd be zero chance
I'd make a mistake

09:37.607 --> 09:38.521
that would affect a patient.

09:38.992 --> 09:40.600
I mean, how could I, right?

09:41.400 --> 09:42.150
Well, I found a way.

09:43.265 --> 09:44.308
Y-you know, honey,

09:45.262 --> 09:47.815
if this internship
isn't the right fit,

09:48.646 --> 09:50.449
I'm sure Lanie would understand.

09:50.690 --> 09:51.268
No.

09:52.005 --> 09:53.638
Dr. Parish gave me
this opportunity,

09:53.639 --> 09:54.796
and I want to see it through.

09:58.717 --> 09:59.309
Well?

10:00.241 --> 10:02.258
The apartment where
John Doe was killed,

10:02.259 --> 10:03.822
we think Thomas Gage
was squatting there.

10:03.823 --> 10:05.290
- Turns--
- I don't care where Gage was

10:05.344 --> 10:07.195
unless it tells me
where he is now.

10:07.542 --> 10:09.159
But I'm very
interested in knowing

10:09.160 --> 10:11.198
how he got out of that
holding cell on your watch.

10:12.501 --> 10:13.878
We're not clear on that, sir.

10:14.027 --> 10:15.935
But we do know how he
left this precinct.

10:16.522 --> 10:18.853
I assume he snuck out
of the back exit.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.085
Actually, he went out
through the front door.

10:23.479 --> 10:25.148
This is him heading
to the lobby.

10:28.899 --> 10:30.485
Where did this man
get a uniform?

10:30.966 --> 10:32.836
He stole it from
the locker room.

10:34.143 --> 10:35.545
Find out what else he did.

10:35.858 --> 10:38.418
Check our security video
and retrace his steps.

10:38.419 --> 10:39.972
I want to know every
move that he made.

10:40.240 --> 10:40.818
Okay.

10:42.596 --> 10:44.796
Gage has been two steps ahead
of us this whole time.

10:45.216 --> 10:46.927
Not only that, but he
must have a partner

10:46.928 --> 10:48.256
who took John Doe
from the morgue.

10:48.428 --> 10:50.079
Which still doesn't
explain why he ended up

10:50.080 --> 10:50.861
wearing those blues.

10:52.730 --> 10:54.371
Why risk stealing a uniform

10:54.372 --> 10:56.137
when he could've just
walked out of the building?

10:56.225 --> 10:58.715
I'll tell you why.
He needed something inside our precinct.

10:59.364 --> 11:00.538
The guy got into our database.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.068
- Looking for what?
- Not what.

11:04.679 --> 11:05.286
Who.

11:09.339 --> 11:10.719
Tracy McGrath of Queens.

11:11.607 --> 11:13.181
He ran her name, and
I think I know why.

11:13.347 --> 11:14.452
Her address is unlisted.

11:15.188 --> 11:17.338
What if getting arrested
was part of Gage's plan?

11:17.611 --> 11:20.218
So he could access our
data for Tracy's address.

11:21.226 --> 11:23.094
All right, you guys pull up
everything you can on Tracy.

11:23.095 --> 11:24.541
Castle and I will
go over there now.

11:24.545 --> 11:25.135
Okay.

11:28.018 --> 11:29.525
Her phone's going
straight to voice mail.

11:30.441 --> 11:32.049
What is her connection
to all this?

11:32.354 --> 11:33.723
Why is Gage so
interested in her?

11:34.212 --> 11:36.098
With any luck, she knows
who Gage really is.

11:47.003 --> 11:47.647
Tracy McGrath?

11:48.811 --> 11:49.695
NYPD.

11:55.225 --> 11:55.809
Castle.

12:05.888 --> 12:08.109
Espo, yeah, we got
here too late.

12:09.088 --> 12:10.993
Uh, she's got one to
the back of the head.

12:11.286 --> 12:13.275
Can you call Lanie and get her
to bring CSU down here?

12:13.904 --> 12:15.084
Yeah. I'm on it.

12:16.175 --> 12:16.901
Captain Gates,

12:17.152 --> 12:19.020
looks like Tracy McGrath
was Gage's next victim.

12:19.401 --> 12:20.360
What do we know about her?

12:20.426 --> 12:22.215
Well, she's 33, no family.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.789
A scientist at a
research foundation.

12:24.313 --> 12:25.554
All right.
Talk to her coworkers.

12:25.722 --> 12:27.465
Find out why Gage
would've wanted her dead.

12:29.869 --> 12:31.122
Looks like she's
been here a while.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.706
Yeah, well, it makes sense.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.716
Gage escaped last night.
He had a 10-hour lead on us.

12:36.912 --> 12:37.622
You stay put.

12:37.700 --> 12:38.979
I'm gonna check the
rest of the place.

13:07.126 --> 13:08.116
Castle...

13:22.310 --> 13:23.436
Where is everybody?

13:23.815 --> 13:25.734
We usually beat the
uniforms to the scenes.

13:25.735 --> 13:27.816
It's not like they want to
hurry and stand around.

13:28.255 --> 13:29.779
Just so you know, I'm
not letting this victim

13:29.780 --> 13:30.562
out of my sight.

13:30.597 --> 13:32.581
- Crazy.
- What is?

13:32.708 --> 13:34.113
The fact that Richard Castle,

13:34.114 --> 13:36.088
a man unburdened by
regret and guilt,

13:36.089 --> 13:38.007
has a child that carries
the weight of the world.

13:38.287 --> 13:40.846
It is not on you that a
dead man came up missing.

13:41.563 --> 13:43.621
Well, how often does something
like that happen anyway?

13:43.728 --> 13:46.814
It never happens, honey. So relax.
It was a freak thing.

13:46.878 --> 13:48.346
Bodies just don't disappear.

13:50.771 --> 13:51.689
Detective Beckett?

13:52.545 --> 13:53.510
Detective Beckett.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.347
Okay, I see where
the blood stain is.

14:00.166 --> 14:01.092
Where is the body?

14:05.560 --> 14:06.134
You okay?

14:06.307 --> 14:07.064
Yeah. You?

14:09.194 --> 14:09.892
Who are you?

14:12.169 --> 14:13.432
Where the hell are
you taking us?

14:17.036 --> 14:18.087
Wherever it is...

14:18.152 --> 14:19.280
it's way down.

14:33.124 --> 14:33.969
What is this place?

14:38.425 --> 14:39.674
I don't know. I have no idea.

14:40.206 --> 14:42.330
Rick Castle at a loss for words?

14:44.307 --> 14:45.491
That must be a first for you.

14:48.210 --> 14:49.345
Sophia Turner?

14:51.210 --> 14:51.972
Hello, Rick.

14:53.123 --> 14:54.346
Welcome to the CIA.

14:57.461 --> 14:58.565
Yeah, that's her.

14:59.210 --> 15:01.058
Tracy's worked for me at
the Newton Foundation

15:01.059 --> 15:01.975
for five years.

15:02.657 --> 15:03.853
I just talked to her yesterday.

15:04.261 --> 15:06.493
We debated the merits
of the Chevy Corvair.

15:07.471 --> 15:08.978
She's a classic car buff.

15:10.137 --> 15:10.748
She was.

15:11.749 --> 15:13.266
And what kind of work
did Tracy do exactly?

15:14.437 --> 15:16.309
It wouldn't get you killed,
if that's what you're asking.

15:16.884 --> 15:19.179
Tracy had a PHD in
applied mathematics.

15:19.648 --> 15:21.559
She'd been developing
statistical models

15:21.560 --> 15:23.423
to predict the affects
of climate change.

15:24.151 --> 15:25.175
Did she have any enemies,

15:25.176 --> 15:26.513
anybody who might
want to do her harm?

15:26.761 --> 15:27.704
None that I know of.

15:28.450 --> 15:29.125
Hold on.

15:29.952 --> 15:31.109
There was something, yesterday.

15:31.110 --> 15:33.888
Uh, she left the office
rather suddenly,

15:33.932 --> 15:34.830
about 3:00.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.758
She didn't check in with me.
She was just gone for two hours.

15:38.699 --> 15:39.658
That wasn't like her.

15:40.595 --> 15:42.092
Do you have any idea
where she went?

15:42.121 --> 15:43.559
No, and when I asked,

15:43.560 --> 15:45.117
she didn't seem to
want to tell me.

15:45.839 --> 15:47.352
We're gonna need access
to her computer,

15:47.443 --> 15:49.119
her e-mails, her
documents, everything.

15:49.768 --> 15:50.718
It's all on our server.

15:51.645 --> 15:52.988
I can log into there from here.

15:54.146 --> 15:55.883
Secret underground headquarters?

15:56.060 --> 15:57.682
This is straight
out of James Bond.

15:59.769 --> 16:01.446
Castle, you're
avoiding the question.

16:02.180 --> 16:03.818
Who's Sophia Turner?
How do you know her?

16:04.293 --> 16:06.339
Uh, it's a... long story.

16:06.360 --> 16:07.559
Well, I'll take the
short version.

16:07.974 --> 16:08.922
Let me give it to you.

16:10.434 --> 16:11.354
What has it been,

16:12.125 --> 16:12.788
12 years?

16:12.789 --> 16:13.618
11 and a half.

16:15.043 --> 16:15.764
Rick and I met

16:15.855 --> 16:17.358
when he was just
beginning to do research

16:17.359 --> 16:18.944
on his first Derrick
Storm novel.

16:20.055 --> 16:22.826
He wanted an
up-close-and-personal look

16:22.827 --> 16:24.478
at the life of a
female CIA agent.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.034
So I gave him one.

16:32.186 --> 16:33.716
You're Clara Strike,

16:33.937 --> 16:36.261
the Clara Strike from the
Derrick Storm books?

16:36.870 --> 16:38.773
I wouldn't say that
I am Clara Strike,

16:38.815 --> 16:41.837
but I'd like to think
that I inspired Rick

16:41.838 --> 16:43.016
in some small way.

16:44.506 --> 16:46.284
Well, that is just fascinating.

16:46.913 --> 16:48.181
- You look good.
- You, too.

16:48.226 --> 16:50.242
Okay, so I hate to
interrupt this reunion,

16:50.243 --> 16:52.468
but we're being
illegally detained,

16:52.733 --> 16:53.718
at least I am.

16:54.094 --> 16:55.277
This is not a detention.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.134
This is a debriefing,
approved by the NYPD.

16:58.900 --> 17:00.259
Feel free to call Ted McQuinn.

17:00.734 --> 17:01.786
The chief of detectives?

17:02.134 --> 17:04.090
He assured me you'd give
us your full cooperation.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.435
I need to know everything
you know about Thomas Gage.

17:06.974 --> 17:09.438
No. Not until you tell me what
the hell is going on here.

17:12.929 --> 17:13.559
Fine.

17:14.448 --> 17:15.470
But that would be getting into

17:15.471 --> 17:17.252
highly classified information

17:17.328 --> 17:18.967
regarding national security,

17:19.213 --> 17:20.936
which, if you were to
reveal it to anyone,

17:21.009 --> 17:22.568
would be considered a
treasonable offense

17:22.569 --> 17:24.169
against the United
States of America,

17:24.358 --> 17:25.606
punishable by death.

17:26.244 --> 17:27.969
So... you still want to know?

17:31.006 --> 17:34.626
We recruited Thomas Gage out
of Seal Team Six in 1997.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.066
Smart, highly trained,
fluent in 11 languages,

17:38.449 --> 17:40.330
Gage was our most
effective asset.

17:40.824 --> 17:42.302
We sent him into conflict zones,

17:42.334 --> 17:43.678
failed states all
over the world.

17:44.054 --> 17:45.698
Gage was adept in
every situation.

17:46.283 --> 17:48.734
Unfortunately, he went rogue.

17:50.107 --> 17:51.542
Based on NSA intercepts,

17:51.543 --> 17:53.106
we believe that Gage
is trying to initiate

17:53.166 --> 17:54.217
a catastrophic event,

17:54.541 --> 17:56.566
which poses an imminent
threat to the country.

17:56.683 --> 17:57.388
So...

17:57.446 --> 18:00.853
that man that Gage pushed
out the window, he was CIA.

18:01.242 --> 18:02.768
Gary Harper. One of our best.

18:02.837 --> 18:04.430
We got a tip on
Gage's whereabouts.

18:04.431 --> 18:05.552
We sent Harper to bring him in.

18:05.827 --> 18:08.067
Obviously, that operation
didn't go as planned.

18:08.620 --> 18:11.462
At which point, you took
the body from the morgue.

18:11.472 --> 18:13.824
This is a national
security crisis.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.365
We didn't want the
NYPD underfoot.

18:16.455 --> 18:17.225
Well, good to know.

18:17.592 --> 18:19.481
So how did you guys get
on to Tracy McGrath?

18:19.530 --> 18:21.268
We monitored data
from your precinct.

18:21.543 --> 18:23.045
Her name came up,
but unfortunately,

18:23.046 --> 18:25.155
by the time our agent got
there, she was already dead.

18:25.226 --> 18:26.251
So why did Gage kill her?

18:26.659 --> 18:27.834
We were hoping you would know.

18:29.291 --> 18:30.423
You can go ahead
and answer that.

18:30.478 --> 18:31.484
Yeah, I was planning on it.

18:32.321 --> 18:33.885
Would you mind terribly
putting it on speaker?

18:36.336 --> 18:37.348
Espo, you're on speaker.

18:37.564 --> 18:40.339
Yeah, so, uh, word came
down from chief of D's.

18:40.547 --> 18:43.106
He said you were on some
kind of special assignment.

18:43.146 --> 18:43.891
What's that about?

18:45.877 --> 18:46.993
Uh, it's a long story.

18:46.994 --> 18:48.423
What do you got
on Tracy McGrath?

18:48.750 --> 18:49.521
It may be nothing,

18:49.522 --> 18:51.283
but she ditched work
yesterday for two hours.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.921
She has a notation
in her day planner,

18:52.922 --> 18:55.002
but all it says is "Pandora."

18:56.751 --> 18:57.800
You know what?
Let me get back to you.

18:59.185 --> 18:59.964
What's Pandora?

19:03.320 --> 19:04.300
According to the chatter,

19:04.469 --> 19:06.932
Pandora is the code name
for Gage's mission,

19:07.399 --> 19:08.993
which means that
the McGrath woman

19:08.994 --> 19:09.962
is mixed up in it.

19:10.185 --> 19:11.980
Now the two of you
know as much as we do.

19:12.283 --> 19:14.124
Look, you have done
impressive work on this case.

19:14.477 --> 19:16.627
I want you to take the lead
in finding Thomas Gage.

19:16.693 --> 19:17.404
Sophia--

19:17.444 --> 19:19.477
Martin, we are up
against the wall.

19:20.316 --> 19:22.350
The CIA is barred from
domestic investigation.

19:22.610 --> 19:24.149
Well, isn't that
what the FBI is for?

19:24.188 --> 19:25.527
Thomas Gage is a hired gun.

19:25.528 --> 19:28.244
We don't know who he works
for or how deep this goes.

19:28.683 --> 19:31.930
All I am asking is that you
continue your investigation,

19:32.148 --> 19:34.659
and we will share all
information we get on him.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.302
And what's the catch?

19:36.490 --> 19:37.332
That you do the same,

19:37.645 --> 19:39.022
and that you report only to me.

19:39.023 --> 19:40.258
This has to stay between us.

19:40.362 --> 19:42.395
Our techs have uploaded
icons on both your phones,

19:42.396 --> 19:44.139
which will connect you
to my direct line.

19:44.369 --> 19:45.987
You've seen what
Gage is capable of.

19:46.110 --> 19:47.787
He's one of our most
dangerous operatives,

19:47.788 --> 19:49.899
and I have no doubt that,
whatever he is planning,

19:50.268 --> 19:52.587
he is completely capable
of carrying out.

19:54.304 --> 19:55.695
I wouldn't put you
in this position,

19:56.537 --> 19:57.891
but this man has to be stopped.

19:59.939 --> 20:01.709
Can I count on you
for your help?

20:02.021 --> 20:03.194
Yes.

20:18.256 --> 20:20.605
Do you realize what this means?

20:20.788 --> 20:22.115
We're spies.

20:22.210 --> 20:23.916
This is like being in
a Jason Bourne movie,

20:23.917 --> 20:26.417
only he's the bad guy, and
the CIA are the good guys.

20:26.418 --> 20:28.643
- That remains to be seen.
- Ooh, wait.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.226
I've gotta see those
direct-dial icons

20:31.227 --> 20:32.792
they put on our phones.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.913
Hey. Why is mine a panic button?

20:38.520 --> 20:40.152
I guess she really
does know you well.

20:41.134 --> 20:42.094
Okay.

20:42.111 --> 20:43.382
- You're upset.
- I'm not upset.

20:43.383 --> 20:44.176
Then what are you?

20:44.177 --> 20:46.540
I am just a little
bit uncomfortable

20:46.541 --> 20:48.603
with the new command structure.

20:48.652 --> 20:50.984
I don't like keeping secrets
from my own people.

20:50.985 --> 20:52.622
You're sure this
isn't about Sophia?

20:52.623 --> 20:53.860
No, why would it be?

20:53.861 --> 20:54.407
Oh, I don't know.

20:54.408 --> 20:56.117
Maybe because I based
a character on her.

20:56.118 --> 20:57.433
Oh, don't flatter
yourself, Castle.

20:57.434 --> 20:58.708
It's not that big an honor.

20:58.709 --> 21:01.097
Good, because Sophia
is on our side.

21:01.098 --> 21:02.112
We're on the same team.

21:02.113 --> 21:03.366
And that doesn't concern you?

21:03.367 --> 21:06.930
You don't think that that will
undermine our unit cohesion?

21:07.280 --> 21:09.146
Hey, I am willing
to let that slide

21:09.147 --> 21:11.499
in the interest of
national security.

21:13.719 --> 21:15.133
Yeah, well, I guess I am, too.

21:18.554 --> 21:20.466
It's just, I might have been
a little bit taken aback

21:20.467 --> 21:22.269
to find out that you had...

21:22.424 --> 21:24.297
researched with someone else.

21:26.053 --> 21:29.902
Look, it was never the way
it is with you and me.

21:29.978 --> 21:32.086
I just hung out with
her for a while

21:32.087 --> 21:34.787
to lend some authenticity
to Clara Strike.

21:34.788 --> 21:37.792
It was a brief moment
a long time ago.

21:38.877 --> 21:40.133
And besides, Nikki Heat

21:40.134 --> 21:42.982
is a far more complex and...

21:43.259 --> 21:45.173
nuanced character.

21:45.174 --> 21:46.171
She is.

21:46.325 --> 21:48.396
And I'm a far more
experienced writer,

21:49.098 --> 21:50.329
more mature.

21:51.855 --> 21:53.216
- One out of two is...
- Mm.

21:53.568 --> 21:55.577
So how long did the
two of you hang out?

21:58.953 --> 21:59.865
A year?

21:59.866 --> 22:02.181
That's your idea
of a brief moment?

22:02.182 --> 22:04.522
I was young, and she
had a lot to teach me.

22:04.523 --> 22:05.856
Ha! Yeah, I'll bet.

22:05.857 --> 22:07.734
A-about the shadowy
world of espionage.

22:07.735 --> 22:09.710
Let me ask you this--
how many other women

22:09.711 --> 22:12.464
have you semi-stalked in
the name of research?

22:13.367 --> 22:14.447
Is this a trick question?

22:14.448 --> 22:16.337
You know what?
I don't even want to know.

22:16.338 --> 22:17.628
Detective Beckett,

22:17.872 --> 22:20.419
Mr. Castle, good
of you to drop by.

22:20.488 --> 22:23.437
So tell me about this special
assignment of yours.

22:23.997 --> 22:25.335
I'm afraid I can't, sir.

22:25.659 --> 22:26.586
Excuse me?

22:26.587 --> 22:29.700
Yes, it's on a
need-to-know basis.

22:31.594 --> 22:33.168
And I need to know.

22:33.554 --> 22:35.263
Sir, I think that the
chief of detectives

22:35.264 --> 22:37.090
would back me up on this one.

22:40.294 --> 22:41.328
Well...

22:41.477 --> 22:42.766
we'll see about that.

22:45.669 --> 22:47.537
Did you see how mad she was?

22:47.603 --> 22:48.953
God, that was so good.

22:49.528 --> 22:50.434
So...

22:50.435 --> 22:51.454
seriously, what's going on?

22:51.455 --> 22:53.708
Guys, I'm sorry.
We really can't talk about it.

22:53.709 --> 22:55.300
Come on. This is us.

22:58.529 --> 23:00.087
No. Hey, sorry, boys.

23:00.088 --> 23:02.047
Classified. Top secret.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.250
Our eyes only.

23:03.251 --> 23:04.371
Defcon 1.

23:04.642 --> 23:05.929
And if I did tell you,

23:07.140 --> 23:08.487
well, then I'd have to kill you.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.879
- Yeah? Good luck with that.
- Yeah, realistically, that's not--

23:10.880 --> 23:12.501
I'm gonna go on record
and say that this sucks.

23:12.533 --> 23:13.181
It sucks.

23:13.204 --> 23:15.496
And noted.
Now let's move on to Tracy McGrath.

23:15.497 --> 23:16.891
Where'd she go after
she left work?

23:16.892 --> 23:18.814
Well, according to her E-Z pass,

23:18.884 --> 23:20.212
she drove down the
Jersey Turnpike

23:20.213 --> 23:22.377
and exited somewhere
near Newark Airport.

23:22.378 --> 23:23.721
We're still trying to
figure out where she went.

23:23.722 --> 23:25.664
Maybe the answer's still
at the crime scene.

23:27.596 --> 23:30.066
There's no signs of
forced entry or struggle.

23:30.067 --> 23:32.655
It's like she knew her
killer, she let him in.

23:32.826 --> 23:34.252
She walked in front of him,

23:34.253 --> 23:35.888
and he shot her in the
back of the head.

23:35.889 --> 23:37.969
Which means she knew Gage.

23:37.970 --> 23:40.048
So how is a climate scientist

23:40.049 --> 23:43.047
mixed up with a
ruthless ex-CIA agent?

23:43.048 --> 23:44.954
And how is she
connected to Pandora?

23:53.527 --> 23:55.967
There's gotta be something
here that ties them together.

23:56.496 --> 23:58.507
Well, she has excellent
taste in cars.

23:58.809 --> 24:00.085
Here's an auto repair manual

24:00.086 --> 24:02.874
for a 1967 Pontiac GTO.

24:04.115 --> 24:05.166
That's funny.

24:06.144 --> 24:08.588
The keys are sitting on a
pile of yesterday's mail.

24:08.589 --> 24:10.241
She drove it before she died.

24:10.262 --> 24:12.248
Except there's no
GTO in the street.

24:12.262 --> 24:14.058
Or in the garage,
so where's the car?

24:14.093 --> 24:16.941
I see a recurring charge
on her credit card.

24:17.197 --> 24:19.860
It looks like she's
paying 100 bucks a month

24:19.861 --> 24:21.079
for Frenchie's Parking.

24:21.281 --> 24:23.448
100 bucks? That's not gonna
get you a space in Manhattan.

24:23.449 --> 24:25.435
Bingo. Billing info says
that Frenchie's is in

24:25.436 --> 24:26.692
Elizabethport, New Jersey.

24:26.693 --> 24:28.321
That's right near
Newark Airport.

24:28.322 --> 24:31.257
So the mystery ride Tracy
took has to do with the GTO.

24:32.792 --> 24:33.645
There it is.

24:33.646 --> 24:36.781
Now that is some classic
Motor City iron.

24:36.952 --> 24:40.113
400 cubic inches with
a Rochester 4-barrel

24:40.114 --> 24:42.095
and 360 horsepower.

24:42.096 --> 24:44.240
- You know muscle cars?
- Oh, yeah.

24:45.869 --> 24:47.806
We should go to the
track sometime, Castle.

24:48.049 --> 24:49.318
See who laps who.

24:51.091 --> 24:53.288
So why do you think Tracy

24:53.289 --> 24:55.205
took off work to come down here?

24:55.689 --> 24:57.908
Maybe to drive it
to a clandestine

24:57.909 --> 25:00.458
Pandora-related, uh, rendezvous?

25:00.459 --> 25:02.146
No. Look at the dust on this.

25:02.338 --> 25:04.100
This hasn't gone
anywhere in a while.

25:06.183 --> 25:07.504
Castle, look.

25:07.864 --> 25:10.577
Maybe she came to stash
something in the trunk.

25:11.283 --> 25:13.193
Handprints, indicating
someone's been in there.

25:13.194 --> 25:14.529
Yeah.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.798
That is not original equipment.

25:18.859 --> 25:21.297
No, but it's probably
why she came here.

25:21.802 --> 25:22.637
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:22.638 --> 25:23.922
Wait--wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

25:24.378 --> 25:25.675
We don't know what's in there.

25:25.874 --> 25:27.416
Yeah, well, there's only
one way to find out.

25:27.417 --> 25:29.378
Yeah, but it might be Pandora,

25:29.584 --> 25:32.921
as in "Pandora's Box,"
as in opening that

25:32.922 --> 25:34.923
could unleash an
unstoppable tide of evil.

25:34.924 --> 25:36.257
Castle, that's a myth.

25:36.258 --> 25:38.066
I'm speaking metaphorically.

25:38.067 --> 25:40.977
Gage is planning a
catastrophic event, right?

25:41.036 --> 25:43.391
So what if there's a
doomsday device in that case

25:43.392 --> 25:44.920
set to go off when you open it?

25:44.921 --> 25:47.694
And ground zero is a parking
garage in New Jersey?

25:47.695 --> 25:48.863
I doubt it.

25:48.864 --> 25:49.882
I ju--

25:55.315 --> 25:57.875
That is a military-grade
cell phone and a scrambler.

25:57.876 --> 25:59.150
That's spy equipment.

25:59.151 --> 26:00.922
Tracy came here to
make a phone call,

26:00.923 --> 26:03.239
and I bet you that the
last number she dialed

26:03.276 --> 26:04.837
is still on the phone.

26:04.928 --> 26:06.752
Close the case and turn around.

26:06.993 --> 26:08.228
Hands in the air.

26:12.523 --> 26:13.635
Gage.

26:14.719 --> 26:16.547
Your weapon and
phones on the ground.

26:18.771 --> 26:21.159
Really?
You put your hands in the air.

26:22.459 --> 26:23.434
Whoa.

26:24.244 --> 26:25.612
Your phones on the ground.

26:25.613 --> 26:26.812
I just upgraded.

26:26.813 --> 26:28.316
This is a brand-new phone.

26:35.066 --> 26:36.409
Now... I'm afraid

26:36.410 --> 26:38.214
you're not gonna like
what comes next.

26:49.935 --> 26:50.926
Castle.

26:55.033 --> 26:56.387
Castle, what are you doing?

26:56.884 --> 26:59.677
Bracing myself to shield you
from a hail of bullets.

27:00.372 --> 27:01.596
Yeah, well, that's
very gallant of you,

27:01.597 --> 27:02.632
but you can stop bracing.

27:02.633 --> 27:04.765
- I think he left.
- Oh.

27:04.766 --> 27:06.691
Man, my life was passing
before my eyes.

27:06.692 --> 27:08.042
I think I lost track of time.

27:08.478 --> 27:10.225
What do you know
about trunk latches?

27:12.478 --> 27:15.021
Well, the bad news is,

27:15.022 --> 27:17.556
this one was not designed
to open from the inside.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.078
And the good news?

27:19.079 --> 27:20.894
At least this time, we're
not handcuffed together.

27:21.195 --> 27:22.987
You know, it's
surprisingly roomy in here.

27:22.988 --> 27:23.872
Well, it's not that roomy.

27:23.873 --> 27:25.892
Sooner or later, we're
gonna run out of air.

27:25.943 --> 27:27.115
We gotta get out of here.

27:27.350 --> 27:29.006
Well, maybe somebody
will find us.

27:29.063 --> 27:32.167
Castle, we are locked
in the trunk of a car

27:32.168 --> 27:33.501
in long-term parking.

27:33.502 --> 27:36.573
It's gonna be hours before anyone
realizes that we're missing.

27:36.574 --> 27:38.443
Who do you think
is gonna find us?

27:38.808 --> 27:41.185
I just feel, in
situations like this,

27:41.186 --> 27:42.483
it's important to have faith.

27:44.941 --> 27:46.344
You pressed the panic
button, didn't you?

27:46.345 --> 27:48.278
Well, if there was
ever a time to panic,

27:48.279 --> 27:49.821
- I think this was it.
- I am--

27:49.822 --> 27:51.895
- You should be thanking me.
- No.

27:51.896 --> 27:55.021
I am not gonna be rescued
by your girlfriend.

27:55.022 --> 27:56.098
Move, Castle.

27:56.099 --> 27:57.777
- Ow. What are you--
- I need to get under there.

27:57.778 --> 27:58.769
Hey!

27:58.770 --> 28:00.517
Hey. Hey!
What are you-- what are you doing?

28:01.049 --> 28:01.665
I got it.

28:01.666 --> 28:02.603
What?

28:02.754 --> 28:04.181
This. Here.

28:06.131 --> 28:07.030
Is it in?

28:07.031 --> 28:07.890
To the left.

28:07.891 --> 28:09.237
Okay. Push.

28:09.854 --> 28:10.816
Scoot down.

28:15.155 --> 28:16.409
- Yes.
- Nice.

28:26.046 --> 28:27.023
For you.

28:33.701 --> 28:35.106
I believe this is yours.

28:35.671 --> 28:37.740
Agent Jones found it in
the parking structure.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.813
Finding the car was great work.

28:41.031 --> 28:42.446
I think it might just
be the break we need.

28:42.447 --> 28:44.115
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

28:44.116 --> 28:47.042
Yeah, especially since it was
detective Ryan who found it.

28:47.119 --> 28:48.873
Well, in any case, the
phone is obviously key,

28:48.874 --> 28:50.544
or else Gage wouldn't
have gone after it.

28:50.566 --> 28:53.014
Well, Tracy McGrath used
it on the day she died.

28:53.323 --> 28:55.496
Maybe she called someone
connected to Pandora...

28:55.497 --> 28:57.579
And then Gage eliminated
her and took the phone

28:57.580 --> 28:59.110
to tie off all loose ends.

29:00.180 --> 29:03.132
Which still doesn't
explain where Gage is now

29:03.133 --> 29:04.945
or who Tracy called.

29:04.946 --> 29:07.144
Well, we'll find that out once
we track the call she made.

29:07.145 --> 29:08.558
But Gage took the phone.

29:08.671 --> 29:10.661
How can you do that when you don't
know what number she called

29:10.662 --> 29:12.368
or even the number
she called it from?

29:12.369 --> 29:14.102
By using all the coolest toys.

29:16.997 --> 29:18.991
Bring up Newton Foundation
to Frenchie's Parking,

29:18.992 --> 29:21.523
commute time by car
at 3:00 pm yesterday

29:21.524 --> 29:22.597
via the turnpike.

29:27.114 --> 29:28.087
41 minutes.

29:28.088 --> 29:30.606
There was a Fender bender
on the GW Bridge.

29:30.607 --> 29:32.354
Factoring the time it
would have taken her

29:32.355 --> 29:33.155
to get to her car,

29:33.156 --> 29:35.260
let's say she got
there at 3:45 pm.

29:35.261 --> 29:37.871
Pull up all cell phone traffic
for the next 15 minutes.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.410
The call would've pinged off
the nearest cell tower.

29:41.411 --> 29:43.737
This guy at the south end
of the Newark Airport,

29:43.738 --> 29:44.925
which processed...

29:46.572 --> 29:49.738
5,429 calls in the
15-minute time frame.

29:49.739 --> 29:51.838
Filter it to calls just to
New York and New Jersey.

29:52.382 --> 29:54.964
That takes us to 4,112.

29:54.965 --> 29:57.386
Now just pay phones and
unregistered cells.

29:59.429 --> 30:01.079
Down to 712.

30:01.112 --> 30:02.097
Calls under a minute.

30:02.098 --> 30:03.378
She would've kept it brief.

30:05.653 --> 30:06.723
We're at 42.

30:07.312 --> 30:09.336
Okay, now triangulate
those 42 signals,

30:09.337 --> 30:10.658
and let's see which
one originates

30:10.659 --> 30:12.382
closest to that
parking structure.

30:20.661 --> 30:23.605
Got it. Yesterday at 3:56 pm.

30:23.606 --> 30:25.196
This call pinged off the tower

30:25.197 --> 30:26.759
and was routed to a pay
phone in Brooklyn.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.825
Uh, intersection of
Plymouth and Gold.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.041
Wow.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.641
It's gotta be the number
Tracy McGrath called.

30:31.642 --> 30:33.104
Get me eyes on that pay phone.

30:33.105 --> 30:35.727
Any local surveillance from
yesterday at 3:56 pm.

30:37.525 --> 30:38.197
Found one.

30:38.198 --> 30:39.276
Isolating now.

30:40.078 --> 30:41.974
There's a video. At 3:56 pm.

30:43.567 --> 30:44.601
Zoom in.

30:45.968 --> 30:47.551
He's got a scrambler.
That's our guy.

30:50.789 --> 30:52.000
He looks familiar.

30:53.639 --> 30:54.577
Freeze there.

30:57.034 --> 30:58.025
Oh, my God.

30:58.259 --> 30:59.590
That's impossible.

31:00.211 --> 31:01.685
He's supposed to be dead.

31:03.392 --> 31:04.384
Who is he?

31:04.962 --> 31:06.473
Dr. Nelson Blakely.

31:06.561 --> 31:08.015
Mathematics professor.

31:08.272 --> 31:09.975
He was a legend at the agency.

31:09.976 --> 31:11.947
A genius. Consulted for us,

31:11.948 --> 31:13.517
but died in 2002,

31:13.518 --> 31:16.361
or at least that's what we
thought until just now.

31:16.704 --> 31:18.252
So he faked his own death.

31:18.779 --> 31:20.154
This just keeps getting better.

31:20.155 --> 31:21.305
No, it doesn't,

31:21.306 --> 31:23.144
not with what this
man is capable of.

31:23.383 --> 31:25.835
Blakely designed math-based
predictive models for us,

31:25.836 --> 31:28.365
models to help create
geopolitical change.

31:28.366 --> 31:29.245
What do you mean by that?

31:29.246 --> 31:31.187
The agency would bring
him a problem--

31:31.188 --> 31:34.202
how can we prevent country
"A" from getting the bomb

31:34.203 --> 31:36.867
or cause regime change
in country "B."

31:36.940 --> 31:38.310
Blakely found solutions

31:38.311 --> 31:41.233
using what he called
linchpin theory.

31:41.263 --> 31:43.918
His approach was to
find a small event

31:43.919 --> 31:45.543
that could trigger
a large event.

31:45.544 --> 31:47.519
Like the assassination
of Archduke Ferdinand

31:47.520 --> 31:48.621
causing World War I.

31:48.622 --> 31:49.602
Exactly.

31:49.855 --> 31:52.429
He once said that you only had
to knock over one domino,

31:52.430 --> 31:53.883
but if it was the right domino,

31:54.262 --> 31:55.443
the rest would fall.

31:57.748 --> 31:59.316
If Blakely is the one
who planned Pandora,

31:59.317 --> 32:00.983
this is beyond a
worst-case scenario.

32:00.984 --> 32:03.835
Blakely is just a
hired gun, like Gage.

32:04.265 --> 32:05.448
He's not the one behind this.

32:05.449 --> 32:07.053
Agent Turner, I've got it.

32:07.335 --> 32:09.483
The video's clean enough
to track his lip movement.

32:09.660 --> 32:10.703
What's he saying?

32:12.606 --> 32:15.297
Meet me Thursday at 5:00 pm.

32:15.392 --> 32:17.565
Bishop A-5,

32:17.566 --> 32:20.744
bishop C-4, pawn E-3.

32:20.855 --> 32:21.977
Chess moves?

32:22.368 --> 32:24.843
Blakely was a world-class
chess player.

32:25.369 --> 32:26.871
It's some sort of code.

32:26.939 --> 32:29.729
Run that pattern against anything
in the encryption database.

32:34.813 --> 32:36.779
This takes us into
a sensitive area.

32:38.175 --> 32:40.376
For your eyes only. I get it.

32:41.857 --> 32:43.207
Thank you so much for your help.

32:44.188 --> 32:45.454
Agent Jones will show you out.

32:45.455 --> 32:47.502
W-wait a minute.
What about Gage?

32:47.503 --> 32:49.982
We need to invest all of our
resources into finding Blakely.

32:49.983 --> 32:51.093
He's the weak link here.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.456
Right, but if you find something
on Gage, you'll let us know.

32:53.814 --> 32:55.818
Absolutely.
We're in this together.

33:02.709 --> 33:03.779
You know what I think?

33:04.537 --> 33:06.326
I think we should crack
that chess code.

33:06.327 --> 33:07.997
The CIA can handle it, Castle.

33:08.215 --> 33:09.362
With their track record?

33:09.363 --> 33:10.538
I'm not so sure.

33:12.206 --> 33:13.273
I'm just sayin'.

33:13.349 --> 33:16.463
Look, we decipher that code,
we can save this country

33:16.464 --> 33:18.580
from a nameless
cataclysmic event.

33:18.581 --> 33:21.363
Look, if you want to go
after Blakely, go ahead.

33:21.714 --> 33:23.426
I'm a homicide detective.

33:23.427 --> 33:24.805
I have to find Thomas Gage,

33:24.806 --> 33:27.230
and I can't do that by
answering to Sophia Turner.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.358
What do you mean?

33:28.359 --> 33:29.636
He killed two people, Castle.

33:29.637 --> 33:30.842
Do you think she even
cares about that?

33:30.843 --> 33:32.703
No. She's got a whole
different agenda.

33:32.704 --> 33:35.362
Yeah, like saving the world.
We're all on the same team here.

33:35.363 --> 33:36.859
No, you're on her team,

33:37.688 --> 33:38.783
'cause the way you look at her,

33:38.784 --> 33:40.414
you're sure as hell not on mine.

33:43.572 --> 33:44.568
Seriously?

33:44.586 --> 33:46.184
This is a secure facility.

33:46.369 --> 33:47.788
We need to keep it that way.

34:02.253 --> 34:03.580
I just had a talk with Alexis.

34:03.581 --> 34:06.540
I am so pleased you are on
board with this internship.

34:06.541 --> 34:08.327
Because I was forced
to be on board.

34:08.328 --> 34:09.902
How could you let
that happen, mother?

34:09.904 --> 34:11.027
Oh, darling, don't be silly.

34:11.027 --> 34:12.150
And you're just in a foul mood

34:12.150 --> 34:13.478
because you had a
spat with Beckett.

34:13.478 --> 34:14.583
I am not in a--

34:15.572 --> 34:17.034
How did you find out about that?

34:17.034 --> 34:19.097
No, wait. Let me guess.

34:19.168 --> 34:21.938
- Beckett to Lanie to Alexis to you.
- W--

34:21.940 --> 34:25.742
See? This, this is
what I was afraid of.

34:25.743 --> 34:27.880
For your information,
we did not have a spat.

34:27.880 --> 34:31.051
I simply chose to
work at home today.

34:31.091 --> 34:33.754
On a case involving

34:33.755 --> 34:34.870
vanishing bodies

34:34.871 --> 34:37.078
and special assignments.

34:37.079 --> 34:39.196
Really? She told you that, too?

34:39.349 --> 34:41.289
- Is nothing sacred?
- Not much.

34:41.290 --> 34:44.141
Yes, well, in any event, I'm
not allowed to discuss it.

34:44.141 --> 34:45.998
Oh, please.
When has that stopped you before?

34:45.998 --> 34:46.909
Well, clearly it's time

34:46.909 --> 34:49.166
I start setting some
boundaries around here.

34:49.167 --> 34:50.465
All right.

34:50.679 --> 34:52.134
I can tell you this much.

34:52.135 --> 34:54.119
- I'm working on a code...
- Uh-huh.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.202
Involving these
three chess pieces.

34:56.203 --> 34:58.544
The answer to which could
avert a catastrophe.

34:58.545 --> 35:00.843
Two bishops and a pawn.
What could it mean?

35:00.844 --> 35:01.952
- I don't know.
- Ohh.

35:02.272 --> 35:03.912
I've been looking up
classic strategies.

35:03.913 --> 35:05.440
I've looked up
famous chess matches

35:05.441 --> 35:07.157
with Fischer, Karpov, Kasparov,

35:07.158 --> 35:10.122
but this pattern never occurs.

35:10.123 --> 35:12.414
Maybe the pieces have nothing
to do with the chess game.

35:12.415 --> 35:17.047
Maybe the pieces represent
something else...

35:17.425 --> 35:18.621
entirely.

35:29.595 --> 35:30.610
Yo, Beckett.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.607
Nothing on Gage, but
remember you asked me

35:33.608 --> 35:35.333
to look for a link
between Tracy McGrath

35:35.334 --> 35:36.968
and some guy named
Nelson Blakely?

35:36.969 --> 35:37.533
Yeah.

35:37.534 --> 35:39.564
I found one from ten years ago.

35:39.643 --> 35:41.572
Tracy and a bunch of her
grad student friends

35:41.573 --> 35:43.128
went on a white-water
rafting trip

35:43.129 --> 35:45.713
with a Dr. Blakely,
their professor,

35:45.714 --> 35:47.353
although it wasn't a
good time for him.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.052
He drowned during the trip.

35:51.122 --> 35:52.377
So he faked his death

35:52.546 --> 35:54.014
and Tracy was in on it.

35:54.181 --> 35:55.668
Who faked his death-- Blakely?

35:56.572 --> 35:58.130
Uh... I'm sorry.

35:58.174 --> 35:59.257
I can't tell you.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.890
You know, a man can
only take so much.

36:06.914 --> 36:07.612
Hey.

36:07.613 --> 36:09.999
- Hey. What are you doing here?
- I found something.

36:10.215 --> 36:11.497
It's about Blakely.

36:11.749 --> 36:13.693
Well, shouldn't you
tell Sophia about it?

36:14.187 --> 36:15.544
She isn't my partner.

36:16.152 --> 36:17.062
You are.

36:20.715 --> 36:21.682
May I?

36:26.901 --> 36:27.911
All right.

36:28.479 --> 36:31.774
Bishop, bishop, pawn.

36:31.775 --> 36:33.516
We know Blakely was a
world-class chess player.

36:33.517 --> 36:35.681
Tracy McGrath played, too.
She had a game timer.

36:35.682 --> 36:38.671
Yet, this placement makes
no tactical sense.

36:38.689 --> 36:39.967
I'm guessing you got a theory?

36:39.968 --> 36:41.941
I don't think the pieces have
anything to do with the game.

36:42.441 --> 36:45.227
I think Blakely was leaving
Tracy a coded message,

36:45.228 --> 36:46.675
telling her where to meet him.

36:46.676 --> 36:48.766
Maybe even a place
where they play chess.

36:48.767 --> 36:51.988
Okay, well, uh, people
play chess in parks.

36:51.989 --> 36:54.782
Uh, Central Park,
Washington Square Park--

36:54.783 --> 36:56.787
those would be great places
to meet up with someone

36:56.788 --> 36:57.955
without drawing attention.

36:57.970 --> 37:03.168
Exactly. Now what if each piece stood
for the first letter of a word?

37:03.169 --> 37:04.709
Bishop for "B," pawn for "P"?

37:04.710 --> 37:06.200
Okay, "B" and then seven spaces,

37:06.201 --> 37:07.398
that could be...

37:08.562 --> 37:09.586
Brooklyn.

37:09.605 --> 37:11.376
And Blakely made his phone
call from Brooklyn.

37:11.377 --> 37:13.424
So Brooklyn-- B-B-P.

37:13.425 --> 37:15.877
Uh, Brooklyn... Bridge Park?

37:17.121 --> 37:19.287
That meeting is at 5:00.
That's in half an hour.

37:19.569 --> 37:22.385
If Blakely shows, we can
find out what Pandora is

37:22.386 --> 37:23.908
and we can find Gage.

37:25.494 --> 37:26.499
What do you say?

37:33.140 --> 37:35.111
Blakely should've
been here by now.

37:36.506 --> 37:37.816
Maybe he knows that Tracy's dead

37:37.817 --> 37:39.797
or maybe Gage
already killed him.

37:40.089 --> 37:42.581
I choose the audacity of hope.

37:42.809 --> 37:44.405
I say, he'll be here.

37:45.206 --> 37:46.789
Well, then shouldn't
you call Sophia?

37:47.588 --> 37:49.052
And look like an
ass if I'm wrong?

37:50.157 --> 37:51.859
You know, I have to admit, I'm
actually kind of surprised

37:51.860 --> 37:53.459
that you've never
mentioned her before.

37:53.677 --> 37:54.943
I wasn't allowed to.

37:55.418 --> 37:57.377
She is an active CIA agent.

37:57.378 --> 37:58.127
I see.

37:58.128 --> 38:00.121
Look, if you want,

38:00.482 --> 38:03.187
I will answer any question
you have about her--

38:03.188 --> 38:04.055
anything at all.

38:04.056 --> 38:05.496
No. Thanks.

38:06.554 --> 38:07.433
Are you sure?

38:07.434 --> 38:09.368
Yeah, I mean, it's really
none of my business.

38:10.252 --> 38:11.902
Okay.
Well, we're done with it then.

38:11.903 --> 38:12.852
Fine.

38:19.876 --> 38:20.834
So...

38:21.955 --> 38:23.315
how close were the two of you

38:23.316 --> 38:24.414
exactly?

38:27.490 --> 38:28.438
There he is.

38:28.705 --> 38:30.279
Come on, Castle.
You said I could ask you anything.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.006
No, seriously. There he is.

38:34.996 --> 38:36.261
Dr. Blakely.

38:38.424 --> 38:41.054
I'm afraid you've mistaken
me for someone else.

38:41.055 --> 38:42.912
No, there is no mistake.

38:45.127 --> 38:46.359
How did you find me?

38:46.544 --> 38:47.712
Through Tracy.

38:48.759 --> 38:49.688
She's dead.

38:50.687 --> 38:52.452
If they got to her,
they can get to me.

38:53.631 --> 38:55.341
We need to leave here now.

38:59.766 --> 39:01.711
I always knew this
day would come.

39:02.703 --> 39:03.934
But Tracy...

39:04.429 --> 39:06.044
Dr. Blakely, what's going on?

39:06.045 --> 39:07.238
What's Pandora?

39:07.854 --> 39:10.342
I need you to drive
me to pier 32.

39:10.343 --> 39:11.674
You're not in a position
to bargain here.

39:11.675 --> 39:14.315
I got in this car voluntarily,
and I'll get right back out

39:14.316 --> 39:16.047
if you don't take me
where I want to go.

39:16.048 --> 39:17.856
Okay, what's at pier 32?

39:18.844 --> 39:20.017
Once we're there,

39:20.649 --> 39:22.081
I'll tell you what
you want to know.

39:24.661 --> 39:26.331
You were top of your field,

39:27.199 --> 39:29.401
a professor, an
advisor for the CIA.

39:29.402 --> 39:30.903
Why fake your own death?

39:32.025 --> 39:35.026
I brought down nations
for the agency.

39:35.027 --> 39:36.896
I played God, but...

39:37.056 --> 39:40.484
my linchpin theory didn't
factor in the human cost.

39:40.485 --> 39:43.451
I knew they'd never let
me leave, so I died

39:43.889 --> 39:45.322
and was reborn.

39:45.690 --> 39:47.405
And the only one who
knew was Tracy?

39:47.824 --> 39:51.117
She was my lifeline.
She steered consulting work my way.

39:51.561 --> 39:54.881
I helped reduce
cholera in Africa.

39:54.882 --> 39:57.931
I predicted that a lone
act of civil disobedience

39:57.932 --> 40:01.159
would trigger an uprising
and remake the arab world.

40:01.160 --> 40:03.730
I-I did good things.

40:07.749 --> 40:08.892
Who killed her?

40:10.687 --> 40:12.834
The same man that's trying
to pull off Pandora.

40:14.296 --> 40:16.377
You mean, they're trying
to make it happen?

40:17.664 --> 40:19.698
This is even worse
than I thought.

40:28.013 --> 40:29.202
All right, talk.

40:29.217 --> 40:30.867
I need to go inside first.

40:30.868 --> 40:32.827
You're not going anywhere until
you tell me about Pandora.

40:32.828 --> 40:33.788
What is it?

40:35.945 --> 40:38.729
It was the name of a white
paper that I wrote.

40:38.730 --> 40:39.745
For whom?

40:39.860 --> 40:41.564
I was hired by a think tank

40:41.565 --> 40:44.361
to identify weaknesses
in US security

40:44.362 --> 40:47.030
so they could be
shored up, protected.

40:48.541 --> 40:51.370
I found an alarming
vulnerability--

40:51.413 --> 40:54.417
a linchpin that was
tied to the economy

40:54.418 --> 40:56.862
that would cause
crisis and devastation

40:56.863 --> 40:58.818
beyond anything we'd ever seen.

40:59.170 --> 41:02.581
The dominos would just
never stop falling.

41:03.586 --> 41:06.210
I asked Tracy to follow
up with the think tank,

41:06.211 --> 41:07.363
but they don't exist.

41:07.364 --> 41:09.823
Whoever they are, I
gave them the blueprint

41:09.824 --> 41:12.767
that will bring about the end
of our country as we know it.

41:15.127 --> 41:16.276
Dr. Blakely,

41:16.752 --> 41:17.861
what is the linchpin?

41:21.197 --> 41:22.825
A flock of pigeons?

41:25.169 --> 41:26.895
Blakely, the linchpin,
what is it?

41:26.896 --> 41:29.303
Pigeons don't fly in flocks

41:29.304 --> 41:31.060
unless they're
fleeing a predator.

41:31.061 --> 41:32.171
They're here.

41:35.833 --> 41:37.179
Wait. Wait! Wait! Wait!

41:37.180 --> 41:38.203
- Hey!
- Blakely!

41:43.293 --> 41:44.827
Come on. Come on!

41:45.727 --> 41:46.992
- Beckett!
- Hold on, Castle.

41:46.993 --> 41:49.171
- Hold on!
- Brake! Beckett!

41:49.172 --> 41:51.815
Hold on, Castle! Aah!

41:52.703 --> 41:57.406
