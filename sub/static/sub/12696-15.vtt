WEBVTT

00:08.233 --> 00:10.267
- Max, we need your help!

00:10.367 --> 00:11.533
- We borrowed mom's tablet
and brought it to school

00:11.633 --> 00:14.167
without asking and
the teacher took it.

00:14.267 --> 00:17.433
- Sounds like you'll be in
trouble if your mom finds out.

00:17.533 --> 00:19.167
Barb!!

00:19.267 --> 00:22.033
- This is serious, Colosso--
we're supposed to take care of

00:22.133 --> 00:24.100
Blobbin's bulldog
Doggin tomorrow.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.733
- And if mom finds out
the school has her tablet,

00:26.833 --> 00:28.133
we'll never get to dog sit.

00:28.233 --> 00:30.300
So, what do we do, Max?

00:32.567 --> 00:34.133
- I'm gonna be honest
with you guys--

00:34.233 --> 00:35.533
I wasn't listening.

00:35.633 --> 00:38.733
- Focus. There's dog
time on the line.

00:38.833 --> 00:41.167
- All right, but first let me
finish my science experiment.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.333
We know what the Animalizer

00:45.433 --> 00:48.900
does to humans,
but what, pray tell,

00:49.000 --> 00:54.500
does it do to wild animals?

00:55.933 --> 00:59.600
- Okay, yeah!
Our problem can wait.

00:59.700 --> 01:03.067
- Prepare yourselves as I pick
up where Mother Nature left off.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.167
- Science!

01:10.267 --> 01:12.133
- NORA: Whoa!
- BILLY: Cool!

01:12.233 --> 01:15.467
He looks crazy.

01:15.567 --> 01:18.100
- Unh, only aggressive
around trash.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.067
- So, unless you're carrying
a big bag of garbage,

01:21.167 --> 01:23.067
you're totally safe.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.667
Uh-oh!

01:28.767 --> 01:30.333
- Gimme that trash!

01:30.433 --> 01:33.567
- Rudest garbage man ever.

01:33.667 --> 01:34.700
- Change it back, Max.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.900
- I will--

01:36.067 --> 01:36.933
after it attacks.

01:37.067 --> 01:38.967
- NORA & BILLY: Max!

01:47.433 --> 01:50.233
- Nope, that was science!

01:51.900 --> 01:54.067
- *

01:54.133 --> 01:55.300
* What you see

01:55.400 --> 01:57.067
* Is not what you get

01:57.100 --> 02:00.167
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:00.267 --> 02:01.900
* We fit right in

02:02.067 --> 02:03.367
* Bet you never guessed

02:03.467 --> 02:04.900
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:05.067 --> 02:06.467
* Just like all the rest

02:06.567 --> 02:08.267
* A picture
perfect family *

02:08.367 --> 02:10.367
* Is what we try to be

02:10.467 --> 02:11.733
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:11.833 --> 02:13.367
* The crazy things we do

02:13.467 --> 02:15.067
* This isn't
make believe *

02:15.133 --> 02:16.800
* It's our reality

02:16.900 --> 02:18.233
* Just your average family

02:18.333 --> 02:21.300
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:21.400 --> 02:25.167
* Livin' a double life *

02:28.300 --> 02:30.333
- How did you even get
the Animalizer?

02:30.433 --> 02:32.467
I thought dad installed
a new security system.

02:32.567 --> 02:34.633
- Yeah, the facial recognition
isn't very sophisticated.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.067
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Welcome back, Hank.

02:42.167 --> 02:44.633
Lookin' good!

02:44.733 --> 02:47.200
- Max, how are we gonna
get mom's tablet back?

02:47.300 --> 02:50.133
- Lucky for you two,
I have a plan.

02:50.233 --> 02:52.167
- Let me guess. Your plan
involves stealing?

02:52.267 --> 02:54.133
- It does not involve stealing.

02:54.233 --> 02:56.467
It is stealing!

02:56.567 --> 02:58.067
All right, everyone
grab a ski mask.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.400
- No! No! No! No! No!
No! No! No! No!

03:00.500 --> 03:02.967
These children are not
committing a felony.

03:03.067 --> 03:06.433
Just give your teacher a basket
of cookies and apologize.

03:06.533 --> 03:07.700
She'll see how mature
you're acting

03:07.800 --> 03:09.333
and give it back to
you willingly.

03:09.433 --> 03:10.967
- Your plan is boring.

03:11.067 --> 03:14.300
Mine has ski masks!

03:14.400 --> 03:16.667
- We're going with
Phoebe's plan.

03:16.767 --> 03:19.500
- Yeah, you peaked
at raccoon, man.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.067
- *

03:22.133 --> 03:23.900
- CHLOE:
And I can do this.

03:25.467 --> 03:27.067
- HANK: Oh!
- BARB: Oh!

03:27.100 --> 03:28.967
Looks like we have a little
gymnast on our hands.

03:29.067 --> 03:32.067
- Oh, either that or she's
doing the pee-pee dance.

03:32.167 --> 03:34.400
- I wanna do gymnastics.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.767
- Oh, ho, ho, how can
we say no to that face?

03:36.867 --> 03:39.067
Of course, you can
do gymnastics.

03:39.167 --> 03:40.800
- Yay!

03:40.900 --> 03:42.800
- BARB: Oh.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.833
- A little gymnastics
class, huh?

03:45.933 --> 03:47.333
Are you sure you guys
are ready for that?

03:47.433 --> 03:48.867
- We'll be fine, Phoebe.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.667
- I'm just saying--I remember
quite a few Saturdays

03:50.767 --> 03:53.067
that turned into
the Hank and Barb Show.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.733
- Hank, talk to your daughter.

03:55.833 --> 03:58.567
- Don't worry, I will keep
an eye on your mom.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.667
- And who's gonna
keep an eye on you?

04:00.767 --> 04:02.833
And who's
gonna keep an eye on you?

04:04.067 --> 04:09.567
- *

04:13.067 --> 04:15.100
- BLOBBIN: Hi-ya! Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

04:15.200 --> 04:16.567
Oh!

04:16.667 --> 04:17.600
Sorry, Cousin Blobbin.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.533
I thought you were
a raccoon man.

04:19.633 --> 04:21.700
- I get that a lot.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.533
Oh, Doggin!

04:28.333 --> 04:30.267
- Aw, she's so cute.

04:30.367 --> 04:32.133
- Just like her daddy.

04:32.233 --> 04:34.200
She's me!

04:34.300 --> 04:36.633
- Bark twice if you need help.

04:36.733 --> 04:39.533
- Be sure Billy and Nora get
these care instructions,

04:39.633 --> 04:41.833
and her favorite
doggy treats.

04:41.933 --> 04:44.067
I've gotta get back to Blob-Co.

04:44.167 --> 04:47.967
My scientists are culture
perfecting text traveling.

04:49.567 --> 04:51.867
Unfortunately it's still
a little ticklish.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.100
- NORA & BILLY:
Doggin!

05:02.200 --> 05:04.600
- NORA: Hi-ya.
You're so cute.

05:04.700 --> 05:05.933
- Oh, hey, how'd it go
with you guys' teacher?

05:06.067 --> 05:09.533
- Awful. Your apology
idea totally backfired.

05:09.633 --> 05:12.233
- Yeah, the teacher felt
the cookies were a bribe.

05:12.333 --> 05:13.800
She's calling mom today.

05:13.900 --> 05:17.367
- That's what ya get for
taking advice from Mom Jr.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.067
Am I Mom Jr.?
- Yep.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.500
We usually only call you that
when you're not around.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.767
- Or when we write
it in secret notes.

05:29.267 --> 05:30.867
So true.

05:33.633 --> 05:36.900
- Hey, kids, we're taking
Chloe to gymnastics--

05:37.067 --> 05:39.533
because she wants to go.

05:39.633 --> 05:42.200
I can't find it anywhere.

05:46.067 --> 05:48.400
Hasn't seen it either.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.067
- I'm sure it'll
turn up somewhere.

05:50.167 --> 05:53.833
Have fun with Doggin.
See you guys later.

05:53.933 --> 05:55.833
- It's our teacher!

05:55.933 --> 05:57.233
- I'll get it.
- No, it's for me.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.800
- I'm expecting a call about--
- Armpit fungus.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.067
- Armpit fungus.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.500
- For Max.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.600
- Touché.

06:11.133 --> 06:13.167
- If we don't answer,
she'll call mom's cell.

06:14.933 --> 06:17.867
Yes, she's home.
One moment.

06:17.967 --> 06:20.533
- Where are you going
with this, Mom Jr.?

06:20.633 --> 06:22.467
- Mom Jr. is no more.

06:22.567 --> 06:25.267
From now on there's
only Fun Phoebe--

06:25.367 --> 06:30.100
and she says let
the fun begin!

06:30.200 --> 06:34.400
Hey, there,
this is Barb, don't ya know?

06:36.733 --> 06:39.400
- Close your eyes.
It's like she's here.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.067
- Oh, ya don't say.

06:41.133 --> 06:44.800
I sure would like to get my
tablet doohickey back, though.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.300
Oh, no, no, no, that's no
bother. You don't have to--

06:47.400 --> 06:49.700
Okie-dokie,
see you in a bit.

06:49.800 --> 06:54.633
Great news. Fun Phoebe
got your tablet back--

06:54.733 --> 06:57.067
and your teacher's
coming over to meet mom.

06:57.133 --> 07:00.533
- Did you say our
teacher's coming over?

07:00.633 --> 07:03.433
- I also said...
* I got your tablet back

07:03.533 --> 07:08.700
- *

07:08.800 --> 07:11.533
- Well, we haven't done
anything all class.

07:11.633 --> 07:13.067
I mean, maybe we
should join in

07:13.100 --> 07:15.167
and make her feel
more comfortable.

07:15.267 --> 07:16.933
- Yeah. For a minute or two.

07:17.067 --> 07:20.867
For Chloe.
- Of course. For Chloe.

07:20.967 --> 07:23.067
- Chloe, how come you
aren't jumping around

07:23.167 --> 07:24.300
like you do at home?

07:24.400 --> 07:25.433
- I don't wanna.

07:25.533 --> 07:29.833
- Aw, come on,
it'll be fun. Watch.

07:32.133 --> 07:33.700
- Hup!
- Hup!

07:35.133 --> 07:36.700
- Hup!
- Hup!

07:40.067 --> 07:42.200
- KIDS: Oooohhh...

07:42.300 --> 07:44.467
- BARB & HANK:
Tumblemans!

07:44.567 --> 07:46.867
- ADULTS & KIDS:

07:51.833 --> 07:53.300
- That was fantastic.
- HANK: Oh.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.367
- Do you think you could do
a little more for everyone

07:55.467 --> 07:56.900
to get the kids into it?

07:57.067 --> 07:58.633
- I'm sorry, Coach Gibbons,

07:58.733 --> 08:01.133
but we're not really
dressed for that.

08:03.533 --> 08:05.733
- BARB & HANK:
Now we are!

08:09.600 --> 08:11.667
- How can you even play with
Doggin at a time like this?

08:11.767 --> 08:13.967
- 'Cause this is the last
dog we'll ever see.

08:14.067 --> 08:15.733
By the time we're
done being grounded,

08:15.833 --> 08:17.900
cats will have won the war.

08:18.067 --> 08:19.833
- Nobody's getting
grounded, okay?

08:19.933 --> 08:22.700
We're gonna use
the Animalizer on Doggin

08:22.800 --> 08:24.667
and train her to be mom.

08:24.767 --> 08:26.533
- I like it.
Do we need a dad?

08:26.633 --> 08:28.400
There's a possum
in the backyard

08:28.500 --> 08:30.267
sittin' around
doin' nothin'.

08:30.367 --> 08:31.767
- Max, stop talking crazy.

08:31.867 --> 08:34.067
Now let's turn Doggin
into our mom.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.100
There's nothing on
the sheet saying we can't.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.567
All right.

08:45.867 --> 08:47.633
What

08:47.733 --> 08:49.167
How'd I get so tall?
How'd I get so tall?

08:49.267 --> 08:50.533
This house
smells like baloney?

08:50.633 --> 08:52.167
Is there baloney?

08:52.267 --> 08:53.567
- Let's see how well
these treats work.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.967
- Oh, my treats!
My treats! My treats!

08:55.067 --> 08:57.667
- Doggin, sit.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.433
I love sitting. Look! Look!
I'm sitting. I'm sitting.

08:59.533 --> 09:02.567
Yum! That's the stuff.
That's the stuff.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.700
- Doggin, shake hands.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.733
I know how to do that.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.633
Wow, fingers are fun.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.867
- Okay, now say,
"My name is Barb

09:12.967 --> 09:15.833
and I want my tablet
back, please."

09:18.300 --> 09:23.200
- My name is Barb and I want
my tablet back, please.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.967
Did I do good

09:25.067 --> 09:28.367
Did I
Did I do good?

09:28.467 --> 09:33.967
- *

09:34.067 --> 09:35.767
- Okay, Doggin, remember
what I taught you?

09:35.867 --> 09:37.133
- Yes, I remember.

09:37.233 --> 09:39.333
I'm your mom
and Phoebe is a butt.

09:39.433 --> 09:41.067
- MAX: Okay. Good. Good.

09:41.100 --> 09:42.967
- Door! Someone's at the door!

09:43.067 --> 09:44.900
Open the door! Door!
Door! Open the door!

09:45.067 --> 09:47.067
Door! Door! Door! Door!

09:47.100 --> 09:48.900
- PHOEBE: Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

09:49.067 --> 09:51.233
Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.667
- Duh-duh-door-door...

09:53.767 --> 09:55.733
- Wait, the face.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.100
- Hi, I'm Max,
and you have no idea

10:04.200 --> 10:06.467
how excited I am for
you to meet my mom.

10:06.567 --> 10:08.800
- Oh, thank you.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.300
Mrs. Thunderman, it's nice
to finally meet you.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.767
Thank you for having me.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.567
- You have a dog, too.

10:17.667 --> 10:19.433
- PHOEBE: Mom. Mom.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.100
Mom!

10:23.900 --> 10:26.367
Why don't we all
just sit...down.

10:38.033 --> 10:41.933
- We love sitting
on the ground.

10:42.033 --> 10:44.833
Oh, those wacky
Thundermans.

10:44.933 --> 10:49.100
- I'm Barb and I want
my tablet back.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.733
- Honestly, I felt
bad taking it.

10:51.833 --> 10:54.400
But Nora and Billy were
warned to put it away,

10:54.500 --> 10:56.733
and I really had no choice.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.267
- Phoebe is a butt.

11:02.633 --> 11:06.767
- Yep, Mom,
Phoebe is a butt...

11:06.867 --> 11:09.567
'cause I totally forgot
the appetizers.

11:09.667 --> 11:10.967
I'll be right back.
- It's okay.

11:11.067 --> 11:13.700
I can't stay long, anyway.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.067
Uh, here is your tablet,
Mrs. Thunderman.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.600
- Sorry you have to go.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.367
- Or stay. Mom's got
a lot of tricks.

11:24.467 --> 11:26.100
- Bye!

11:29.400 --> 11:31.867
- I can't believe
Fun Phoebe pulled it off.

11:31.967 --> 11:33.733
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

11:33.833 --> 11:35.967
Incoming transmission
from Cousin Blobbin.

11:36.067 --> 11:38.100
- Oh, yay, the show
isn't over.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.133
- Oh, no.
Quick, hide Doggin.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.800
- Doggin, oh, look, yummy meat!
Come on. Come on.

11:43.900 --> 11:46.100
- Meat! Meat! I like meat!

11:46.200 --> 11:49.833
- Hey, guys, how's
my doggie woggins?

11:49.933 --> 11:51.900
- She's a real lady.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.667
Oh, I see you're having
a little snack.

11:55.767 --> 11:59.267
Remember, meat makes
Doggin very destructive.

11:59.367 --> 12:01.700
Why isn't that on here?

12:01.800 --> 12:03.867
- Oh, it is. Turn it over.

12:07.967 --> 12:10.167
You see this
chewed up brick?

12:10.267 --> 12:12.667
It's all that's left of
Blobbin's Steak & Karaoke Bar.

12:14.233 --> 12:19.067
It's also a reminder--
never ever give her meat.

12:20.467 --> 12:22.500
Anyway, glad things
are going well.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.167
Bye!

12:29.833 --> 12:31.933
- Okay, nobody panic.

12:32.067 --> 12:33.867
We just have to get
that chicken from her.

12:33.967 --> 12:35.667
Billy, super-speed over there
and grab the chicken.

12:39.833 --> 12:43.067
Another bad idea,
Fun Phoebe.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.433
- All done.

12:48.533 --> 12:50.733
Need...more...

12:50.833 --> 12:53.967
mea-a-a-a-a-t!!

12:55.367 --> 12:57.133
Mea-a-a-a-a-t!!!

13:00.567 --> 13:02.767
- Wow, she's fast.

13:02.867 --> 13:04.733
- Huh, who's having
as much fun as I am?

13:04.833 --> 13:06.900
Raise your hand.

13:10.633 --> 13:13.433
- She's not in the neighborhood.
We've checked everywhere.

13:13.533 --> 13:15.333
- Max, you have to come
help us find Doggin

13:15.433 --> 13:16.900
before Blobbin comes
back to pick her up.

13:17.067 --> 13:19.867
This is all your fault, Funbe.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.767
- Uh, or is it the fault
of a diabolical genius

13:22.867 --> 13:26.500
seen here disabling
dad's security system?

13:26.600 --> 13:28.333
- Okay, you got me.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.267
That's a good picture.
Can you send it to me?

13:30.367 --> 13:32.233
- Max, quit joking around.
You're gonna help us.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.433
Doggin's never been
a human before.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.233
Who knows what she's up to.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.733
- Must...find...

13:37.833 --> 13:39.500
mea-a-a-a-a-t!!!

13:43.233 --> 13:45.233
- I think I found
something that might help.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.900
It's a barcode for
Doggin's UPS tracker. See?

13:48.067 --> 13:49.500
- Hand it over.

13:49.600 --> 13:53.400
I'll use my expert computer
skills to find her.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.667
Thunder monitor, find her.

13:57.767 --> 13:59.467
- Hopefully,
she'll come back.

13:59.567 --> 14:02.600
Unless she finds a place where
meat just falls from the sky.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.100
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Doggin is entering Splatburger.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.933
- Splatburger--where meat
just falls from the sky.

14:19.767 --> 14:22.800
- HANK: Hup!
- BARB: Hup!

14:22.900 --> 14:26.967
- ADULTS & KIDS:

14:27.067 --> 14:28.167
- BARB: Thank you.

14:28.267 --> 14:30.633
We are "The Tumblemans."
- HANK: Hup!

14:30.733 --> 14:32.633
- Mommy, Daddy,
I'm ready now.

14:32.733 --> 14:33.867
- Oh, in a minute, sweetie.

14:33.967 --> 14:35.967
I think the kids want
more Tumblemans.

14:36.067 --> 14:37.900
- KIDS: Yeah!

14:38.067 --> 14:40.600
- Okay. Get off
the mat, sweetie.

14:40.700 --> 14:43.167
I think these nice people
are trying to take our picture.

14:43.267 --> 14:45.833
- HANK: Hup!
- BARB: Hup!

14:45.933 --> 14:48.067
- Okay. All right,
Hank, this is it.

14:48.167 --> 14:50.133
Let's do the Tumblemans'
twisty flip 'n throw.

14:50.233 --> 14:51.967
- Oh, that trick's too hard.

14:52.067 --> 14:53.733
We've never even
gotten it right.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.233
- Today is our day.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.067
We both knew this was
happening when we squeezed

14:57.133 --> 14:58.833
into these tights and hid
'em under our clothes.

14:58.933 --> 15:00.767
- Okay, let's do it!

15:01.867 --> 15:03.500
Hup!
- Hup!

15:06.933 --> 15:11.167
- Oh, my clavicle!
- Oh, my back!

15:17.967 --> 15:20.467
What is this stuff?

15:20.567 --> 15:22.967
It's delicious!

15:23.067 --> 15:26.533
Oh! Oh! All food
should be this!

15:26.633 --> 15:29.233
- MRS. WONG:
Stop it!

15:29.333 --> 15:31.800
Keep that ruckus down,
you lunatic!

15:31.900 --> 15:34.767
- Bring me more burgers!!

15:34.867 --> 15:39.133
Burger-r-r-r-rs!!

15:41.200 --> 15:43.800
- Well, this isn't
in the commercial.

15:43.900 --> 15:48.133
- Hey, do you like
bacon burgers?

15:48.233 --> 15:50.933
- That's two meats, ha!

15:51.067 --> 15:54.333
Ah! Get! Get! Get! Get!

15:54.433 --> 15:57.067
Not to worry, customers.

15:57.167 --> 15:59.367
She's the cops' problem now.

15:59.467 --> 16:02.767
Please, go back to
stuffing your faces.

16:02.867 --> 16:04.233
Hello, police?

16:04.333 --> 16:06.700
- Oh, no, Cousin Blobbin's gonna
come back and find out

16:06.800 --> 16:08.367
that we got his dog arrested.

16:08.467 --> 16:13.067
- Don't worry, Fun Phoebe's
got this, don't ya know?

16:13.167 --> 16:15.700
- Stop it. We don't need
Fun Phoebe right now,

16:15.800 --> 16:17.167
we need Mom Jr.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.567
- I thought you guys
didn't like Mom Jr.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.733
- We never said
we didn't like her.

16:20.833 --> 16:22.300
- For the record--I did.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.667
- But at least Mom Jr.
looks out for us.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.100
- Aww...

16:27.200 --> 16:29.200
Okay, that settles it.

16:29.300 --> 16:33.367
Mom Jr.'s back and she's got
a bonzer of a plan, mate!

16:33.467 --> 16:35.767
I'm done with accents.
Come on.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.067
- Here's the thing, Chloe.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.933
Years ago, your father
and I went undercover

16:43.067 --> 16:45.333
and joined the circus
to catch a villain.

16:45.433 --> 16:47.900
- But we caught more than
a villain on that mission.

16:48.067 --> 16:51.067
We caught "Tumble Fever."
- Mm-hm.

16:51.133 --> 16:53.067
We also caught a real fever.

16:53.133 --> 16:58.233
That's because clowns
don't wash their hands.

16:58.333 --> 17:01.300
Since then, having you
kids in these classes,

17:01.400 --> 17:03.800
it's our only chance
to get our tumble on.

17:03.900 --> 17:07.633
- We got carried away and forgot
the real reason we came here--

17:07.733 --> 17:08.867
for you.

17:08.967 --> 17:10.767
- Yeah. We're sorry.

17:10.867 --> 17:12.067
So, what do you say, hm?

17:12.167 --> 17:13.967
Feel like doing
some gymnastics?

17:14.067 --> 17:15.967
- Can I do it with
the Tumblemans?

17:16.067 --> 17:17.567
- Oh, sure.

17:17.667 --> 17:21.067
I just wish we had one of
those cool costumes for you.

17:21.100 --> 17:24.500
- ADULTS & KIDS:

17:24.600 --> 17:26.600
- A Tumbleman's
always prepared.

17:26.700 --> 17:30.200
You'd have remembered that if
you hadn't gotten clown fever.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.700
- All right, guys,
this is it.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.933
Let's give 'em the Tumblemans'
twisty flip 'n throw.

17:34.067 --> 17:35.567
- CHLOE & BARB: Yeah!

17:35.667 --> 17:37.433
- Hup! Hup!

17:37.533 --> 17:39.233
Hup!

17:41.600 --> 17:43.633
- ADULTS & KIDS:

17:43.733 --> 17:45.733
- We are the Tumblemans!

17:45.833 --> 17:47.567
- ADULTS & KIDS:

17:49.400 --> 17:52.733
- *

17:52.833 --> 17:54.933
- Okay, Mom Jr. is gonna
try to keep them busy

17:55.067 --> 17:56.433
as long as she can.

17:56.533 --> 18:00.367
The rest is up to you.
- Okay, entering stealth mode.

18:04.733 --> 18:06.400
- Starting now.

18:08.067 --> 18:09.900
- Finally!

18:12.067 --> 18:13.733
- The problem is Loco Lucy.

18:13.833 --> 18:15.667
I have her trapped
in my office. Come on.

18:15.767 --> 18:18.533
- Uh, Mrs. Wong,
I brought you something.

18:18.633 --> 18:21.333
- Oh, I love cookies.
But why?

18:21.433 --> 18:25.067
I hate you and your
family so much.

18:25.133 --> 18:27.067
- The truth is
I feel bad about

18:27.167 --> 18:29.200
what my dog did to
your restaurant.

18:30.367 --> 18:32.833
That's a crazy
lady in there.

18:32.933 --> 18:35.333
- Uh, no, it's a dog.

18:35.433 --> 18:38.200
The crazy lady
might be out here.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.267
Anyway, officers, you should
throw the book at me.

18:41.367 --> 18:43.433
All the books.
Heavy ones first.

18:43.533 --> 18:45.367
- We don't actually
throw books.

18:45.467 --> 18:46.933
You know that, right?

18:47.067 --> 18:48.667
- I keep suggesting it,

18:48.767 --> 18:51.067
but nobody ever
takes me seriously.

18:51.133 --> 18:53.133
- Yep.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.367
- Looks like we're doing
this just in time.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.700
So, uh, what kinda books are
you thinking about throwing?

18:58.800 --> 19:00.867
Paperbacks

19:00.967 --> 19:03.067
Audio books?

19:07.367 --> 19:09.067
- Look at this mess.

19:09.133 --> 19:12.067
- It wasn't me.

19:12.167 --> 19:14.567
- This is hilarious.

19:14.667 --> 19:17.900
- It was me! It was me!
I did the entire thing myself!

19:18.067 --> 19:19.533
- Good girl.

19:19.633 --> 19:21.500
When we get home, I'm gonna need
you to do this to Phoebe's room.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.600
- Phoebe's a butt.
- Yeah. That's it.

19:26.267 --> 19:27.633
Come on.
- Give me a boost, Nora.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.367
- You got it.
- Let's go.

19:29.467 --> 19:32.267
- BILLY: Whoa!

19:32.367 --> 19:34.067
- Come on, get up.
We don't have much time.

19:34.167 --> 19:35.267
Give me the Animalizer.

19:35.367 --> 19:39.067
- Oh! Oh! My toy! My toy!
Chase me!

19:39.133 --> 19:40.433
- Get her, Billy!

19:40.533 --> 19:42.467
- Chase me! Chase me!

19:42.567 --> 19:45.733
- MAX: Whoa!

19:45.833 --> 19:48.833
- Come and get it!!!

19:48.933 --> 19:51.467
- So, Officer Batista, if you
don't wanna throw books,

19:51.567 --> 19:53.133
what do you wanna throw?

19:53.233 --> 19:54.300
- He likes to throw
his attitude around.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.667
- Buh! Buh! Buh! Buh!

19:55.767 --> 19:58.667
Officer Batista has
the talking spoon.

19:58.767 --> 20:02.033
- Excuse me. May I have
the talking spoon?

20:02.133 --> 20:04.033
- Sure.
- Thank you.

20:04.133 --> 20:06.733
What is wrong
with you bozos?

20:06.833 --> 20:09.400
Nutball Nancy is tearing
my office apart.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.700
If you won't go
in there, I will.

20:14.167 --> 20:16.767
- MRS. WONG: Oh!

20:16.867 --> 20:18.267
What is happening?

20:18.367 --> 20:20.167
Why won't this open?

20:20.267 --> 20:22.500
- Huh, the door's locked.

20:26.367 --> 20:28.267
Why are you everywhere?

20:31.900 --> 20:33.367
- My dog!

20:33.467 --> 20:36.933
- Where did that
dog come from?

20:37.033 --> 20:39.867
Where's Wacky Wendy?

20:39.967 --> 20:40.900
- The room's clear, Martin.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.400
- But there was a woman,
a real woman.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.967
- I'm sorry, ma'am,
but we can't arrest dogs.

20:46.067 --> 20:48.033
No, we can't.

20:48.133 --> 20:50.067
No, we can't.
No, we can't.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.500
- Martin, grow up.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.500
- All right,
come on, Doggin.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.500
Let's leave Mrs. Wong
to her imaginary friends.

20:56.600 --> 21:00.333
- Huh! I'm not making her up.
She's real!

21:00.433 --> 21:02.433
My chicken might be made
in a lab in my basement,

21:02.533 --> 21:04.767
but she's real!

21:13.267 --> 21:16.567
- Why are you
even out here?

21:20.300 --> 21:22.267
- Hup!
- Hup!

21:22.367 --> 21:25.233
- Yay. That was amazing.

21:25.333 --> 21:26.600
Can I have my dog now?

21:26.700 --> 21:29.067
- Well, the kids probably
took her for a walk.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.633
You know, they weren't
here when we got home.

21:30.733 --> 21:33.100
- I guess that means you have
some more time to enjoy--

21:33.200 --> 21:35.133
the Tumblemans!

21:35.233 --> 21:36.467
Hup!

21:36.567 --> 21:39.600
- BLOBBIN: Oh, thank goodness!
Doggie woggins.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.333
- Thanks for letting us play
with her, Cousin Blobbin.

21:41.433 --> 21:42.867
- No, thank you.

21:42.967 --> 21:45.067
You can't tell,
but this is her happy face.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.800
Oh, nope,
that's her potty face.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.100
Gotta go.

21:52.533 --> 21:55.533
Oh, no, what have
you been eating?

21:55.633 --> 21:57.467
- We're actually getting
away with this.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.800
- Whose face is that
on our portrait?

21:59.900 --> 22:01.633
- Fun Phoebe did it!

22:10.967 --> 22:26.567
- *
