WEBVTT

00:01.934 --> 00:06.052
He goes from the top of the key.
He shoots, he scores!

00:08.054 --> 00:11.649
l cannot believe Justin Timberlake
is from the same species.

00:11.693 --> 00:13.844
Some boys are such pigs.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.532
-Lilly!
-What?

00:18.214 --> 00:21.251
Close your mouth.
We're in the ninth grade.

00:21.294 --> 00:25.048
You got to start acting more like,
l don't know, a girl.

00:25.774 --> 00:29.210
What are you talking about?
l act like a girl all the time.

00:29.254 --> 00:30.607
lncoming!

00:31.174 --> 00:33.369
Truscott from downtown!

00:35.054 --> 00:36.612
Don't say boo-yah, don't say boo-yah.

00:36.654 --> 00:38.133
Boo-yah!

00:39.734 --> 00:41.804
Yeah, nice shot, Shaq.

00:41.854 --> 00:43.685
<i>Muy</i> macko.

00:43.734 --> 00:45.372
lt's ''macho.''

00:45.414 --> 00:48.133
Whatever. You know l'm bad at French.

00:49.494 --> 00:52.372
Well, at least l know how to be a girl.

00:56.254 --> 00:59.007
l never thought this day would come,

00:59.614 --> 01:01.013
but Amber and Ashley are right.

01:01.054 --> 01:02.931
l hate you for making me say that.

01:02.974 --> 01:04.646
They're not right!
l know how to be a girl.

01:04.694 --> 01:07.254
Yeah? Then why don't you have a date
for the dance on Friday?

01:07.294 --> 01:09.808
Not everyone is going to the dance.
You're not going.

01:09.854 --> 01:12.163
l've got a Hannah concert.

01:12.214 --> 01:13.886
Details. Details.

01:14.414 --> 01:16.609
Hey, guys, did you hear
who's going to the dance Friday night

01:16.654 --> 01:18.053
with Gabe Lamotti?

01:18.094 --> 01:22.007
You mean, Hottie Lamotti
with the swimmer's body?

01:22.054 --> 01:23.612
-Who?
-Me!

01:23.654 --> 01:26.168
We started as lab partners
and the next thing l know,

01:26.214 --> 01:30.173
l'm growing his boutonniere
in its own self-contained biosphere.

01:31.534 --> 01:32.808
Who are you guys going with?

01:32.854 --> 01:35.288
l'm not going. l have a thing.

01:35.734 --> 01:37.725
Yeah, l got a thing, too.

01:37.774 --> 01:41.403
Different thing than her thing,
but a thing. Big thing.

01:42.734 --> 01:46.613
No dates? Well, don't feel bad.
There'll be more dances.

01:46.654 --> 01:50.010
Unless global warming kills us first.
Bye!

01:51.574 --> 01:54.486
You're right. Even Saint Sarah
has a date for the dance.

01:54.534 --> 01:55.933
l'm a failure as a girl!

01:55.974 --> 01:59.284
No. Listen, l'm not going
to let you give up, okay?

01:59.334 --> 02:01.370
There's a ninth-grade girl
in there somewhere,

02:01.414 --> 02:03.245
we just got to get her out, okay?

02:03.294 --> 02:07.606
Let's start with this hat,
and stop sitting like a guy.

02:07.654 --> 02:10.043
And <i>basta</i> with the pasta already!

02:11.774 --> 02:14.288
Like that is gonna do any good.

02:15.374 --> 02:17.330
Well, it looks like it's working
for Matt Marshall.

02:17.374 --> 02:19.763
Matt Marshall! l've been crushing
on him ever since the first time...

02:19.814 --> 02:22.044
-Hey, Lilly.
-'Sup, Matt?

02:22.974 --> 02:24.726
Act like a girl.

02:24.774 --> 02:27.413
So, Matthew, come here often?

02:29.094 --> 02:31.608
Of course he does, it's school!

02:32.654 --> 02:35.168
So are you going to the dance
this Friday?

02:35.214 --> 02:36.772
No, l don't think l'll actually...

02:36.814 --> 02:38.486
l don't know. Maybe. Why do you ask?

02:38.534 --> 02:41.253
l just thought if you were going then,
you know, we could maybe...

02:41.294 --> 02:42.693
-Carpool?
-No, l kind of meant...

02:42.734 --> 02:43.803
-Yeah?
-What?

02:43.854 --> 02:45.412
-What?
-Sweet niblets.

02:45.454 --> 02:47.604
Of course
she'll go to the dance with you!

02:47.654 --> 02:49.326
-Cool!
-Cool.

02:49.374 --> 02:51.490
l'm going to the dance with Matt! Yes!

02:51.534 --> 02:53.126
How do l do it?

02:59.094 --> 03:00.607
<i>come on!</i>

03:00.654 --> 03:04.647
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

03:04.694 --> 03:08.289
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe</i>
<i>every colour</i>

03:08.334 --> 03:12.213
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

03:12.254 --> 03:17.089
<i>lt's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

03:17.134 --> 03:20.444
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

03:20.494 --> 03:25.727
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:25.774 --> 03:29.847
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:29.894 --> 03:31.771
<i>chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:31.814 --> 03:33.486
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:33.534 --> 03:37.812
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:37.854 --> 03:39.526
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:39.574 --> 03:42.930
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:49.094 --> 03:50.812
So cool. l love this part.

03:50.854 --> 03:54.733
Lilly. Lilly, l hope
you've got your shopping shoes on,

03:54.774 --> 03:58.767
'cause l'm gonna take you
from skate chick to date chick.

03:59.654 --> 04:01.167
Okay. One second,
but l'm watching <i>Teen court.</i>

04:01.214 --> 04:03.045
lt's almost over.

04:03.374 --> 04:06.332
<i>Let's listen as Judge Joe</i>
<i>hands down his verdict</i>

04:06.374 --> 04:10.526
<i>in the case of ''Bobby and Michael</i>
<i>and the Busted Motorcycle. ''</i>

04:10.574 --> 04:14.010
<i>Bobby, you borrowed a bike</i>
<i>and brought it back busted.</i>

04:14.054 --> 04:15.453
<i>That's bologna.</i>

04:15.494 --> 04:20.204
And speaking of food,
it's time for justice to be served.

04:20.733 --> 04:22.132
-Serve it up.
-Serve it up.

04:22.174 --> 04:24.290
What's on the menu for today, Big D?

04:24.334 --> 04:29.124
<i>We're going to treat our guilty party</i>
<i>to a hearty helping of oatmeal,</i>

04:29.934 --> 04:32.971
<i>with plenty of</i>
<i>Vermont's finest maple syrup.</i>

04:34.974 --> 04:38.967
<i>Yes, sir, Big D,</i>
<i>that is some sweet justice.</i>

04:39.014 --> 04:40.049
<i>case closed.</i>

04:40.494 --> 04:44.453
Dude, he got served!
Breakfast, lunch, and...

04:48.014 --> 04:50.164
This is what
you were talking about, right?

04:50.214 --> 04:54.446
Yeah. Listen, just because
Matt already asked you to the dance

04:54.494 --> 04:56.371
doesn't mean
that he can't change his mind.

04:56.414 --> 04:58.450
You know,
you got him nibbling on the cheese,

04:58.494 --> 05:01.247
but now you got to snap the trap!

05:02.494 --> 05:04.052
Miley, he already asked me,

05:04.094 --> 05:06.403
it's not like he's gonna dump me
and then ask some...

05:06.454 --> 05:08.172
What is he doing?

05:08.214 --> 05:10.887
l love skateboarding. lt's so viral.

05:11.494 --> 05:15.089
-lt's ''virile.''
-Who cares. lt's still hot!

05:16.734 --> 05:18.770
-And so are you.
-And so are you.

05:22.334 --> 05:24.723
Looks like someone's
messing with your man.

05:24.774 --> 05:28.926
That's it. l'm through being
one of the guys. Girl me up, baby.

05:32.094 --> 05:35.564
<i>JBAD 1 09.6, Los Angeles.</i>

05:35.614 --> 05:37.252
<i>Now get those dialling digits ready,</i>

05:37.294 --> 05:40.491

05:45.894 --> 05:47.964
Hey, there, new buddy, how's it going?

05:48.014 --> 05:50.005
-Not now, Thor!
-Okay.

05:51.414 --> 05:53.291
-How about now?
-No!

05:53.334 --> 05:54.733
Okay.

05:56.574 --> 05:58.451
-How about now?
-No!

05:58.494 --> 06:01.133
Look, l'm trying to win a contest here,

06:01.174 --> 06:03.893
<i>congratulations!</i>
<i>You're the lucky 2 4th caller!</i>

<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

06:07.774 --> 06:11.892

<i>Hello?</i>

06:13.094 --> 06:14.766
-Hello?
-Hello?

06:14.814 --> 06:16.293
<i>lf you're gone, l'm moving on.</i>

06:16.334 --> 06:18.643
Hello? Hello?

06:18.694 --> 06:21.527
Hello? Sorry, can't talk now.

06:23.214 --> 06:24.693
Holy cow.

06:24.734 --> 06:27.202
You! Don't hang up!

06:29.574 --> 06:31.326
Let me help, eh?

06:31.374 --> 06:32.932
No!

06:35.254 --> 06:39.611
Yes, thank you.
Thank you. J-Bad rocks!

06:40.334 --> 06:44.009
Wow. Courtside seats for the Lakers!

06:45.134 --> 06:48.331
You know what l'd do
if l had courtside seats for the Lakers?

06:48.374 --> 06:51.127
l'd take you
'cause you're my new buddy.

06:51.174 --> 06:53.369
So who are you gonna take?

06:53.934 --> 06:57.006
Well, actually, Thor,
l hadn't really thought about it.

06:57.814 --> 07:00.931
l get it. You got lots of friends.

07:00.974 --> 07:04.967
Hey, l know what that's like.
Back on the farm, l had tons of friends.

07:05.014 --> 07:06.493
And cows.

07:07.814 --> 07:09.691
Okay, all my friends were cows,

07:09.734 --> 07:16.765
but they were really good listeners
with big brown eyes, sweet smiles...

07:18.254 --> 07:19.972
Don't look at me!

07:22.094 --> 07:24.767
Thor, do you want to go to the game?

07:26.414 --> 07:30.692
Yes! Yes! Thank you, Jackson!
Thank you.

07:31.174 --> 07:33.927
You are the ice beneath my skates.

07:33.974 --> 07:36.204
Don't ever say that again!

07:36.254 --> 07:38.563
Okey-dokey, artichoke-y.

07:39.614 --> 07:41.172
That, either!

07:42.294 --> 07:46.890
There he is! l just heard you on J-Bad!

07:46.934 --> 07:53.089
Yee, doggies! Me and my boy are
gonna sit courtside at a playoff game!

07:54.374 --> 07:57.764
Can you believe this is happening?

08:01.654 --> 08:03.485
Come on, Lilly.
Nobody's gonna laugh at you.

08:03.534 --> 08:05.923
-You look great.
-l do not.

08:05.974 --> 08:11.128
l look like Amber and Ashley
threw up on me. l can't do this.

08:11.174 --> 08:13.927
-Hello.
-Hey, hey, new girl.

08:13.974 --> 08:17.125
Where'd you come from? Hot-sylvania?

08:17.174 --> 08:18.846
Shut up, Nick. lt's me.

08:19.494 --> 08:22.292
The new girl sounds kind of like Lilly.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.932
lt is Lilly!

08:26.254 --> 08:29.803
What happened to you? You look fine!

08:29.854 --> 08:31.128
-Really?
-Totally.

08:31.174 --> 08:32.448
Yeah.

08:32.974 --> 08:34.532
Books, books.

08:35.134 --> 08:37.693
Oh, my. These books are so heavy.

08:39.014 --> 08:41.847

-No, no, please. l got them. l got them.

08:41.894 --> 08:44.044

08:53.014 --> 08:55.653
<i>Happy, happy playoffs</i>
<i>May all your dreams come true</i>

<i>My mom made it for you</i>

09:01.014 --> 09:04.245
-Man.
-Yeah, it's a basketball cake.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.604
And there's 1 3 pounds of
Minnesota cream cheese in there.

09:07.654 --> 09:10.214
That'll put some junk in your trunk.

09:10.694 --> 09:12.412
Yeah, it looks great.

09:12.454 --> 09:15.446
lt should.
My mom stayed up all night baking it.

09:15.494 --> 09:19.089
She's just so happy
l've finally got a two-legged friend.

09:19.574 --> 09:22.611
Any-hoo, what were you gonna say
about the game?

09:22.654 --> 09:26.408
-You're paying for parking.
-Okey-dokey, artichoke-y.

09:26.454 --> 09:29.446
Thor, stop thaying that! Thaying that!

09:30.854 --> 09:34.529
Listen, Thor, l'm late for thience clath!
Dang flabbit!

09:35.654 --> 09:38.214
-Todd, you're so funny.
-Lower and slower.

09:38.694 --> 09:41.367
Todd, you are so funny.

09:42.374 --> 09:46.333
So, New Lilly, you want to hang
at the dance with me?

09:46.374 --> 09:48.842
Sorry, boys, she's taken.

09:49.494 --> 09:52.566
l am not just good. l am scary good.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.891
-Lilly?
-Oh, boy.

10:00.574 --> 10:02.963
-Wow, you look so...
-l know.

10:03.014 --> 10:06.290
-And it's all for you.
-And it's all for you.

10:08.974 --> 10:10.965
Save it for the dance.

10:13.334 --> 10:14.608
Bye.

10:15.694 --> 10:19.209
''Save it for the dance.''
Way to snap the trap!

10:19.734 --> 10:21.087
Nails.

10:21.534 --> 10:23.092
l am so proud of you.

10:25.494 --> 10:28.372
<i>l'd like to dedicate this song</i>
<i>to a special friend</i>

10:31.694 --> 10:32.763
<i>How did l get here?</i>

10:32.814 --> 10:35.567
<i>l turned around and there you were</i>

10:35.614 --> 10:38.082
<i>l didn't think twice or rationalise</i>

10:38.134 --> 10:41.365
<i>'cause somehow l knew</i>

10:41.414 --> 10:44.611
<i>That there was more</i>
<i>than just chemistry</i>

10:44.654 --> 10:47.532
<i>l mean, l knew</i>

10:47.574 --> 10:51.453
<i>But l figured it's too good to be true</i>

10:55.174 --> 10:57.972
Go ahead, honey. l'll be right there.

10:58.734 --> 11:01.089
Lilly, what are you doing here?

11:01.134 --> 11:03.807
l tried calling you
every time l got offstage.

11:03.854 --> 11:06.527
Were you a little too busy with Matt?

11:06.574 --> 11:08.292
He stood me up.

11:10.094 --> 11:14.007
-What?
-l sat at home waiting for two hours.

11:16.534 --> 11:19.606
Lilly. Look at you.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.687
l bet some hearts were broken tonight.

11:24.294 --> 11:25.852
Just one.

11:28.214 --> 11:29.966
Way to go, Dad.

11:37.694 --> 11:42.927
How can boys be so cruel?

11:44.174 --> 11:46.290
How could someone do
something like that to Lilly?

11:46.334 --> 11:49.883
Don't they know
how delicate and fragile girls are?

11:51.414 --> 11:54.212
Sugar and spice and hands like a vice.

11:54.254 --> 11:56.529
Heaven help the boy
who stands you up.

11:56.574 --> 11:58.690
You got that right, bub!

12:04.774 --> 12:06.048
Morning.

12:07.014 --> 12:09.369
-How you feeling?
-Okay.

12:09.414 --> 12:13.373
-Thanks for letting me sleep over.
-lt was our pleasure, Lilly.

12:13.854 --> 12:17.085
Lilly! That's what Matt called me!

12:19.174 --> 12:21.210
-Dad!
-That's her name.

12:22.174 --> 12:24.290
-Think a little!
-Okay.

12:25.534 --> 12:29.846
Would you like some bacon,
little pieces of bacon?

12:32.294 --> 12:35.650
No, thanks.
But don't let me spoil your morning.

12:35.694 --> 12:39.130
You go ahead
and live your happy lives. Enjoy.

12:40.654 --> 12:43.851
-Dad, maybe you should...
-Gotcha.

12:45.414 --> 12:47.211
l'm just gonna go out on the deck
and eat.

12:47.254 --> 12:49.563
l just need to get one
of these placemats.

12:49.614 --> 12:51.047
Matt!

12:52.854 --> 12:54.207
Out!

12:56.054 --> 12:59.490
Lilly, l hate seeing you like this.
lt's not right.

12:59.534 --> 13:01.172
There's got to be a way to get him back

13:01.214 --> 13:03.489
for all the pain and suffering
he's caused you.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.570
l'd like to know how.

13:06.894 --> 13:09.408
<i>Have you been put through</i>
<i>pain and suffering?</i>

13:09.774 --> 13:11.890
<i>Did someone do you wrong?</i>

13:11.934 --> 13:14.732
-They did her wrong!
-Heck, yeah!

13:14.774 --> 13:19.404
<i>Well, don't just sit there and take it,</i>
<i>take it to court.</i> The Teen Court.

13:19.454 --> 13:22.287
-<i>Where justice is served.</i>
-Where justice is served!

13:35.774 --> 13:38.686
Hey, Dad, l need to talk to you
about these tickets.

13:39.534 --> 13:42.844
Who cares if your boy
got into Harvard?

13:42.894 --> 13:45.249
My boy's taking me to the Laker game.

13:45.974 --> 13:48.090
Yep. Courtside seats.

13:48.614 --> 13:50.366
He could've taken anybody
he wanted to,

13:50.414 --> 13:53.963
but he decided to take the old man.
Yep.

13:54.014 --> 13:55.686
All right, Fred, listen,
l got to get off here.

13:55.734 --> 13:59.886
l got to go give my boy a big bear hug.
Talk at you later.

14:01.494 --> 14:02.722
My boy!

14:05.894 --> 14:09.204
So what was it you wanted to say
about the tickets?

14:10.014 --> 14:12.289
They have holograms.

14:12.334 --> 14:14.052
Look, he's dunking, now he's not.

14:14.094 --> 14:17.882
Dunking. Not. Dunking. Not. Dunking.
Not. Dunking. Not. Dunking. Not.

14:17.934 --> 14:18.969
Bye.

14:21.454 --> 14:24.844
My boy. My strange, strange boy.

14:36.294 --> 14:37.727
Hey, Dad!

14:39.094 --> 14:40.163
What's up, good buddy?

14:40.214 --> 14:42.444
Hey, hey, l just wanted to tell you
how much l'm looking forward

14:42.494 --> 14:44.166
to going to that game with you tonight,

14:44.214 --> 14:47.604
sitting side by side,
right next to each other.

14:49.894 --> 14:53.284
Excuse me.
You know what these burritos do to me.

14:55.254 --> 14:57.210
But l love them!

14:59.334 --> 15:01.802
Are you gonna be all right
for the game tonight, Son?

15:01.854 --> 15:03.606
Yeah. Yeah, Dad. No, l'll be fine.

15:03.654 --> 15:07.932
l just hope you don't mind
because this is my third.

15:10.614 --> 15:12.764
And l probably shouldn't
have gone <i>con queso.</i>

15:12.814 --> 15:14.566
You know what l'm saying?

15:18.574 --> 15:22.567
You know, come to think of it, l do have
some paperwork l need to catch up on.

15:22.614 --> 15:24.889
Maybe you could find somebody else
to go with you.

15:24.934 --> 15:28.290
But, Dad, it's supposed
to be just the two of us.

15:31.734 --> 15:34.965
There's no one else
l'd rather share this experience with.

15:35.814 --> 15:37.167
Lucky me.

15:37.214 --> 15:39.045
But, hey, if you don't really want to go,

15:39.094 --> 15:41.403
l mean,
l could probably find somebody.

15:43.814 --> 15:47.693
Lakers rule!
So, what time are we leaving?

15:50.174 --> 15:52.290
Hey, maybe Thor would like to go.

15:52.974 --> 15:55.488
-Jackson?
-What? What? lt's like fate!

15:55.534 --> 16:00.130
Him just showing up here like
l invited him, which, of course, l didn't!

16:01.174 --> 16:03.483
l get it. You want me to lie.

16:04.814 --> 16:08.011
Mr Stewart,
is it okay if l lie in your house?

16:09.734 --> 16:13.932
All right, fine. l... l invited Thor first,

16:13.974 --> 16:16.693
but then you went all ''my boy'' on me,

16:16.734 --> 16:18.804
and he brought over
that basketball deathcake.

16:18.854 --> 16:21.573
l gained five pounds
just looking at the thing!

16:21.614 --> 16:22.683
-Now, hold on, son.
-No, l know.

16:22.734 --> 16:24.486
l know, Dad,
l screwed up and l'm sorry.

16:24.534 --> 16:26.047
l'm a terrible person.

16:26.094 --> 16:28.130
Look, l don't even deserve
to go to this game.

16:28.174 --> 16:29.607
Why don't you guys
just take the tickets?

16:29.654 --> 16:31.133
Son, l screwed up and l'm sorry.

16:31.174 --> 16:32.527
You don't have to yell at me.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.566
l mean,
l'll just watch the game on Tv and...

16:35.974 --> 16:37.407
You're sorry?

16:37.454 --> 16:40.571
They were your tickets. l invited myself.

16:40.614 --> 16:43.845
And l'll tell you what, you were just
trying not to hurt the old man's feelings

16:43.894 --> 16:47.773
and that means more to me
than any old silly basketball game.

16:49.294 --> 16:53.287
l'll just let you guys
have your father-and-son moment.

16:53.334 --> 16:54.926
So beautiful.

16:59.574 --> 17:04.170
Okay. l know what you're thinking,
but that was not me.

17:06.414 --> 17:08.530
<i>Welcome to</i> The Teen Court.

17:08.574 --> 17:12.532
<i>Today, we hear the case of</i>
<i>''Dissed, Dumped and Dateless. ''</i>

17:12.574 --> 17:15.771
<i>First, let's meet our defendant,</i>
<i>Matt Marshall,</i>

17:15.814 --> 17:18.328
<i>high school sophomore</i>
<i>and alleged dumper.</i>

17:18.374 --> 17:22.162
<i>And now our dumpee</i>
<i>is entering the courtroom.</i>

17:23.814 --> 17:25.213
You're going down, pal.

17:31.494 --> 17:32.847
-Save it for the judge.
-Right.

17:32.894 --> 17:36.773
<i>All rise for</i>
<i>the honourable Judge Joe Barrett.</i>

17:36.814 --> 17:38.611
Thank you, Big D.

17:39.654 --> 17:43.488
When l first read this case,
l pushed it to the top of my docket.

17:43.534 --> 17:47.322
You want to know why?
Because l've got a daughter, hotshot.

17:48.014 --> 17:49.163
Yeah.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.366
Slam dunk, baby.

17:52.214 --> 17:54.045
Now, sweetheart, it says here

17:54.094 --> 17:58.007
that you're suing for the cost of a dress,
hair and makeup.

17:58.054 --> 18:00.204
-ls that true, darling?
-Don't forget the shoes.

18:00.254 --> 18:02.609
-Tears.
-And mani-pedi.

18:04.734 --> 18:07.294
This girl got a mani-pedi for you?

18:07.934 --> 18:10.812
-l can explain.
-You'll have your chance.

18:10.854 --> 18:13.652
l have to say that. He's got no chance.

18:15.574 --> 18:17.883
Now, tell me what happened, angel.

18:18.974 --> 18:23.172
My friend's too upset to speak,
so she asked me to plead her case.

18:23.214 --> 18:26.172
-Go on and proceed, baby girl.
-Thank you.

18:28.094 --> 18:32.724
Your Honour,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

18:32.774 --> 18:36.892
what would this country be
if men didn't keep their promises?

18:36.934 --> 18:40.244
What if George Washington
promised to cross the Delaware,

18:40.294 --> 18:44.731
but didn't
because it was a little chilly outside?

18:44.774 --> 18:48.892
What if Abraham Lincoln promised
to save the Union,

18:48.934 --> 18:52.893
but broke that promise
'cause he wanted to buy a new hat?

18:53.254 --> 18:56.371
What if Rutherford B. Hayes...

18:56.414 --> 18:59.565
Yo, Tina Talks-a-lot, come here.

19:02.654 --> 19:04.565
l know what you're thinking.

19:04.614 --> 19:07.492
How does she do it without any notes?
Well...

19:09.054 --> 19:11.124
l'll tell you what l'm thinking.

19:11.174 --> 19:14.644
lf somebody doesn't get food dumped
on them in the next five minutes,

19:14.694 --> 19:17.003
then my audience is going to dump me.

19:17.054 --> 19:20.842
And if Joe gets dumped,
Joe can't pay for his big boat.

19:20.894 --> 19:23.283
And Joe likes his big boat.

19:24.174 --> 19:25.607
Got it.

19:25.654 --> 19:30.933
Okay, so you asked her out,
you stood her up

19:30.974 --> 19:32.965
and you broke her heart.

19:33.694 --> 19:38.563
And now all we want to know is, why?
Why? Why? Why?

19:38.614 --> 19:40.445
-Big boat!
-l'm done.

19:42.614 --> 19:45.492
Now, before l pronounce you guilty,
do you have anything to say?

19:45.534 --> 19:46.569
Your Honour...

19:46.614 --> 19:49.606
Come on, come on,
he hasn't got all day!

19:50.854 --> 19:56.008
This isn't fair. l only changed my mind.
She changed her... Everything.

19:57.734 --> 20:00.453
l asked out this really cool skater girl,

20:00.494 --> 20:05.648
and the next day,
she's all girly and frilly and weird.

20:05.694 --> 20:09.767
l mean, ''Save it for the dance.''
Where'd that come from?

20:11.454 --> 20:14.571
She just wasn't the girl
l had a crush on.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.889
-You had a crush on me?
-Yeah.

20:16.934 --> 20:21.803
-ls this true? Did you change?
-Well, she made me.

20:23.174 --> 20:25.324
Everything seems to come back to you.

20:25.374 --> 20:28.127
Well, l was just trying
to turn her into a ninth-grader.

20:28.174 --> 20:31.530
l mean, you should've seen
the way she looked before.

20:31.574 --> 20:34.611
-l liked the way she looked before.
-You did?

20:34.654 --> 20:39.045
What does he know? Has he ever read
a teen fashion magazine? l think not!

20:39.614 --> 20:40.888
He doesn't know what he wants.

20:40.934 --> 20:44.085
He needs to be told what he wants.
He's a boy!

20:44.134 --> 20:47.922
l'll tell you what l want.
l want to serve up some justice.

20:47.974 --> 20:51.011
And l think l know just who
l want to serve it up on.

20:51.054 --> 20:54.842
-Serve it up! Serve it up! Serve it up!
-Serve it up! Serve it up! Serve it up!

20:54.894 --> 20:57.044
-Serve it up! Serve it up!
-Serve it up! Serve it up!

20:57.094 --> 20:59.972
Whoa, whoa, whoa, two seconds.
l'm begging!

21:00.014 --> 21:01.413
Thank you.

21:02.414 --> 21:07.124
lsn't the important thing that these
two wonderful kids are back together?

21:07.174 --> 21:09.642
lsn't that why we're all here?

21:09.694 --> 21:12.686
Have you ever seen this show?
Look around.

21:15.054 --> 21:16.965
Okay, l admit it. l'm sorry.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.333
Lilly, l should've never tried
to change you.

21:18.374 --> 21:19.443
You're great the way you are.

21:19.494 --> 21:20.563
Totally.

21:20.614 --> 21:23.492
-So you forgive me?
-Yeah. Sure, whatever.

21:23.534 --> 21:25.968
Look at that. Everybody's happy.

21:26.574 --> 21:29.884
Looks like another <i>Teen court</i> case
is closed.

21:29.934 --> 21:31.492
Not quite.

21:32.974 --> 21:34.327
Oh, boy.

21:35.574 --> 21:39.169
<i>Today's guilty party</i>
<i>gets a heaping plate of spaghetti,</i>

21:40.094 --> 21:42.813
<i>smothered in a hearty tomato sauce</i>

21:42.854 --> 21:47.291
<i>and topped with plenty of</i>
<i>squirmy, oily anchovies!</i>

21:50.614 --> 21:53.970
That is some stinky justice!
Case closed.

21:54.774 --> 21:58.733
Where'd you get these anchovies, Joe?
Fishing on your big boat?

22:03.654 --> 22:07.727
Trading two seats for three.
That was sheer genius, Son.

22:07.774 --> 22:10.447
And getting up here
was great exercise.

22:11.054 --> 22:12.931
My lungs are on fire.

22:12.974 --> 22:15.283
Criminy, my nose is bleeding.

22:16.014 --> 22:19.643
So we're a little high up.
At least the sound is great.

22:20.934 --> 22:23.732
Dad! Dad, save the popcorn!
