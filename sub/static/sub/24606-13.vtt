J Disturb the sound of silence

41:05.040 --> 41:10.353
<i>3 Fools said I you do not know</i>

41:10.440 --> 41:15.753
<i>3 Silence like a cancer grows</i>

41:15.840 --> 41:21.597
J Hear my words that I might teach you

41:21.680 --> 41:26.675
J Take my arms that I might reach you

41:26.760 --> 41:30.355
<i>3 But my words</i>

41:30.440 --> 41:34.798
<i>3 Like silent raindrops fell</i>

41:37.080 --> 41:41.278
J And echoed in the wells

41:41.360 --> 41:45.797
& Of silence

41:45.880 --> 41:50.477
<i>3 And the people bowed and prayed</i>

41:50.560 --> 41:56.317
J To the neon god they made

41:56.400 --> 42:01.429
<i>3 And the sign flashed out its warning</i>

42:01.520 --> 42:07.232
<i>3 In the words that it was forming</i>

42:07.320 --> 42:09.470
<i>3 And the sign said</i>

42:09.560 --> 42:13.440
J The words of the prophets
are written on

42:13.520 --> 42:16.592
<i>3 The subway walls</i>

42:16.720 --> 42:20.918
J And tenement halls

42:21.000 --> 42:24.277
