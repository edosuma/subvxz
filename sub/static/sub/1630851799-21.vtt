<i>- Tonight the four-part
Beverly Hills reunion begins.</i>

00:10.401 --> 00:12.142
<i>♪</i>

00:14.318 --> 00:15.319
- How are you?
- Hi!

00:15.363 --> 00:16.668
- You look wonderful.

00:16.712 --> 00:19.410
- You look wonderful.
- Get on in here.

00:19.454 --> 00:20.716
- Everyone's like,

00:20.759 --> 00:21.804
"Oh, my God, is she gonna
go to the reunion?"

00:21.847 --> 00:23.066
I'm like,
"yeah, [bleep]."

00:23.110 --> 00:24.154
- Yeah, I'm going.
- "She's shown up

00:24.198 --> 00:25.460
for everything else.
Why wouldn't she?"

00:25.503 --> 00:26.939
- quitter.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.593
Last night, I had a dream
that we were at the reunion.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.421
- Don't you say that to me.
Don't--

00:30.465 --> 00:32.206
- I can say anything
I want to say.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.337
- You go--
- So can I!

00:33.381 --> 00:34.947
- So can all of us.

00:34.991 --> 00:38.168
- There's gonna be some shots
taken and some shots fired.

00:38.212 --> 00:40.518
the moment you call me a liar,
it's game on.

00:40.562 --> 00:43.086
- You don't know that!
- Let me finish, Garcelle!

00:43.130 --> 00:44.479
- Why didn't you
come to say,

00:44.522 --> 00:46.089
"Rinna, what are you doing?"

00:46.133 --> 00:48.265
- And guess what.
There's gonna be some winners,

00:48.309 --> 00:49.658
and there's gonna be
some losers.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.355
- Well, that's life, baby.

00:51.399 --> 00:52.835
- Where's your anger
towards him?

00:52.878 --> 00:55.838
- Am I angry now
enough for you?

00:55.881 --> 00:57.535
Remember when you called me
and you said,

00:57.579 --> 00:59.189
"These girls have
flipped on you"?

00:59.233 --> 01:03.367
- Well, that'll come up
at the reunion. Get ready.

01:03.411 --> 01:07.458
<i>- Tonight the four-part
Beverly Hills reunion begins.</i>

01:07.502 --> 01:09.591
Do you stand by your assertion
that the leather pants--

01:09.634 --> 01:12.724
- They weren't my favorite.
- I am longwinded.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.378
I just want to say this, Andy,

01:14.422 --> 01:16.685
and this is really important,
am I boring you?

01:16.728 --> 01:18.165
- Oh!

01:18.208 --> 01:21.907
- We are joined by the one
and only Kathy Hilton.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.127
- I have a few notes in case,

01:24.171 --> 01:26.129
'cause I wanted to address
a few things.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.131
- Bring it, Kathy!
Bring it, bitch.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.611
- All these things
I don't feel great about.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.526
I did them. It happened.

01:31.569 --> 01:33.876
Each and every one
of them haunts me.

01:33.919 --> 01:37.445
- You really experienced
threats and hate speech.

01:37.488 --> 01:40.143
- It's hundreds a day.
- Wow.

01:44.191 --> 01:48.238
- First I say too much,
and then I don't say enough.

01:48.282 --> 01:51.415
- What you just threw down
shows exactly who you are.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.939
- You and your husband and you
and your husband

01:53.983 --> 01:55.550
were laughing
at my up life.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.160
- I can't control what comes
out of their mouth.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.728
- And you know what? I can't
control what Tom Girardi did.

01:59.771 --> 02:02.600
- The way that you spoke to me
is not okay.

02:02.644 --> 02:07.170
- You were being a bitchy

02:07.214 --> 02:09.172
- We're gonna put you
on a skewer, and I'm gonna

02:09.216 --> 02:10.608
fire up the barbecue.

02:10.652 --> 02:11.914
Why didn't you leave
Tom sooner?

02:11.957 --> 02:13.220
- Where was I going?

02:13.263 --> 02:14.351
- I know what you make
on this show.

02:14.395 --> 02:15.657
- Hold on.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.268
- Did you feel you were
held captive?

02:18.312 --> 02:19.878
He's having multiple affairs.

02:19.922 --> 02:22.185
Yet as we know,
he put $20 million...

02:22.229 --> 02:23.447
- No.

02:23.491 --> 02:27.190
- And more into your account.
Who believes

02:27.234 --> 02:30.280
Erika did not know anything
about what Tom was doing?

02:30.324 --> 02:32.456
- Can someone please back me
the up

02:32.500 --> 02:34.676
on what I'm saying?

02:34.719 --> 02:37.331
- You were manipulating
the narrative by saying

02:37.374 --> 02:40.290
that the cognitive decline
started three years ago.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.727
- That's not true.
Again here you are

02:42.771 --> 02:45.208
looking at me
rolling your eyes.

02:45.252 --> 02:50.300
- It lands differently when
there are air crash victims.

02:50.344 --> 02:53.303
Have you asked him
if he did it?

02:53.347 --> 02:56.959
- I asked him why am I--why...

03:12.888 --> 03:17.675
<i>♪</i>

03:17.719 --> 03:18.720
- I'm Ready.
- You're ready?

03:18.763 --> 03:20.417
- Right this way.

03:20.461 --> 03:21.940
- What time does
my sister get here?

03:21.984 --> 03:23.594
- Thanks, Radu.

03:25.074 --> 03:27.381
- How cushy
and comfortable for her.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.688
- If I don't put fake lashes
on, then I'm not in a reunion.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.864
- In 11 years of doing it,

03:32.908 --> 03:36.041
this one seems like
the stakes are higher.

03:36.085 --> 03:39.001
- Well, for some people more
than others, obviously.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.698
- How's it gonna go with Erika?

03:40.742 --> 03:42.265
- Keep seeing,
like, stories online

03:42.309 --> 03:44.441
that she's not talking to me
and she's not happy.

03:44.485 --> 03:45.616
- Well, is she talking to you?

03:45.660 --> 03:47.314
- No.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.751
- You nervous about seeing her?
- Yeah. She said she hated me.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.622
- I know who's gonna
come for me. I have an idea.

03:51.666 --> 03:56.279
- Who's coming for you?
- Dorit, Rinna. I'll handle it.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.802
- You always do.

03:57.846 --> 04:01.284
- Come on, baby. Let's go.
You're in the right room now.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.720
- Five minutes to air,
everyone.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.287
Let's make sure
everybody's in place.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.723
- Come on in.
- Where are we sitting?

04:05.767 --> 04:07.290
- Oh, just seat yourself.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.814
- Ready came four on Andy.
- Steven.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.816
I need Steven
to do hand makeup.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.818
- How do you make
the phone turn off?

04:13.862 --> 04:15.124
- We need a millennial.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.387
- All right, guys, let's go.
- Clear the set.

04:17.431 --> 04:18.736
- Three. Two.

04:18.780 --> 04:19.781
- Okay, you're
stressing me out.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.173
- One.
- Hey, everybody.

04:21.217 --> 04:24.438
Welcome to the "Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"

04:24.481 --> 04:27.049
season 11 reunion.
I'm Andy Cohen

04:27.092 --> 04:30.008
joined by the stunning women
of Beverly Hills.

04:30.052 --> 04:32.663
Hi, ladies.
Hi, Andy.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.404
- Crystal, welcome
to your first reunion.

04:34.448 --> 04:35.536
- Thanks.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.886
- How you feeling?
- I feel good.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.844
- I half--half expected you

04:39.888 --> 04:41.759
to show up
in the leather pants.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.632
- They belong in the clubhouse.
- They do!

04:44.675 --> 04:47.722
I know, they do, yes.
Hi, Sutton.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.114
- Hi, Andy.
- How are you?

04:49.158 --> 04:51.465
- I'm good.
- And how's your ankle?

04:51.508 --> 04:53.075
- It's doing good.
I mean, we're, like--

04:53.118 --> 04:54.729
- I see you're in high heels.
Those are some...

04:54.772 --> 04:56.208
- Y'all, I'm very--
- shoes.

04:56.252 --> 04:58.341
- I'm very excited, because
this is the highest heel

04:58.385 --> 05:00.604
that I've worn
in probably a year.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.084
- Really pretty.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.086
- Maybe we could put your boot
in the clubhouse too.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.131
- Oh, gosh, no.
- That's all right.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.916
- Like, "I'm good."
- Hi, Dorit.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.526
- Hi, Andy.
- Great to see you.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.747
- Good to see you as well.
- Are you wearing a Dorit...

05:12.790 --> 05:14.401
- Design.
- Wedding gown?

05:14.444 --> 05:15.793
- This is part of, like,
the ready-to-wear,

05:15.837 --> 05:17.012
but it could also be,

05:17.055 --> 05:19.362
you know, in the wedding
dress collection.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.757
It's got thousands of
embellished white glass pearls.

05:22.800 --> 05:23.975
- Looks great.
- I love it.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.412
- Thank you.
- Gorgeous.

05:25.455 --> 05:26.674
- Hi, Garcelle.
- Hi, Andy.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.458
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.

05:28.502 --> 05:31.592
- I noticed you sipping some
tequila just a few minutes ago.

05:31.635 --> 05:35.552
- Andy! Get my picture
with my tequila.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.467
- Did that--did that...
- Yeah, it's good.

05:37.511 --> 05:38.642
- Equalize you?

05:38.686 --> 05:40.035
- I mean, this is
my first in person.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.472
Last time was, you know,
on Zoom. And so...

05:42.516 --> 05:45.519
- Oh, that's true.
- Yeah, let's go.

05:45.562 --> 05:46.650
- All right. Hey, Rinna.

05:46.694 --> 05:47.869
- Hi.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.479
- Who is she tonight?

05:49.523 --> 05:51.002
- We haven't really named her.
- Okay.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.395
- Why don't you guys
come with a name?

05:52.439 --> 05:53.918
- Priscilla.
- Priscilla! I like Priscilla!

05:53.962 --> 05:55.659
- I like Priscilla.
- Yeah, I like that too.

05:55.703 --> 05:56.878
- What do you think
about Priscilla?

05:56.921 --> 05:57.922
All right.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.402
We agree on something.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.577
- Hey!

06:00.621 --> 06:02.579
- There we go.
Good way to start the day.

06:02.623 --> 06:03.667
- Love it.
- Hey, Kyle.

06:03.711 --> 06:04.842
- Hey, Andy.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.801
- Welcome to your 11th reunion.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.846
- Can you believe that?
- Wow.

06:08.890 --> 06:09.978
- You have a different sister

06:10.021 --> 06:11.501
that's gonna be
joining us tonight.

06:11.545 --> 06:12.894
- Yes, I do.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.635
- Having sat here with you
so many years

06:14.678 --> 06:15.897
<i>when Kim was joining,</i>

06:15.940 --> 06:17.899
<i>when you two weren't
in the best place,</i>

06:17.942 --> 06:19.988
tonight should be
a cakewalk with Kathy, right?

06:20.031 --> 06:22.686
- Absolutely.
- Yes. And I should mention,

06:22.730 --> 06:27.082
we are in a simulation
of Kathy Hilton's backyard.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.563
<i>- That is incredible.
- What's your prediction?</i>

06:29.606 --> 06:32.217
<i>Will Kathy recognize
where we are?</i>

06:32.261 --> 06:33.697
- I don't know. Maybe.

06:33.741 --> 06:34.872
- She's gonna say,
"Where are we?"

06:34.916 --> 06:36.221
- "What is this?"
- Yeah.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.527
- It's "inspired by."

06:37.571 --> 06:38.876
- Right. Right.

06:38.920 --> 06:44.055
- Yes.
- Hey, Erika. What's new?

06:44.099 --> 06:45.230
- A lot.
- Yes.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.058
- A lot is new.
- A lot is new.

06:47.102 --> 06:48.973
How are you feeling
about being here tonight?

06:49.017 --> 06:50.540
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

06:50.584 --> 06:52.847
- Yeah.
- How'd you sleep?

06:52.890 --> 06:54.675
- Very well.
- Really?

06:54.718 --> 06:56.764
- Yeah. Was I supposed
to sleep any other way?

06:56.807 --> 06:58.809
- I don't know. I don't know
if today was something

06:58.853 --> 07:01.899
that you were looking forward
to or dreading.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.205
- Actually--no, actually I am.
- Why?

07:03.248 --> 07:04.554
- I'm looking forward

07:04.598 --> 07:06.469
to closing this chapter
and moving on.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.079
- Mm-hmm.
- So, yeah.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.560
- There's obviously so much
going on with you this season,

07:10.604 --> 07:12.954
and it's a highly
unusual situation,

07:12.997 --> 07:16.261
because things are still
unfolding as we speak,

07:16.305 --> 07:19.743
and even between the time
that we tape this and airing

07:19.787 --> 07:22.006
new things could come out.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.573
I mean, how are you
feeling about

07:23.617 --> 07:28.099
finally kind of addressing
this stuff with the viewers?

07:28.143 --> 07:29.536
- I'm happy to do so.
- You are.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.668
- I'm happy to say everything
that I can say.

07:31.712 --> 07:32.974
Please understand there are
some things

07:33.017 --> 07:36.151
that I cannot answer,
but I will do my best

07:36.194 --> 07:39.067
to give every part
of the story that I can.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.285
- Okay.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.026
- This is the toughest part
of my life.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.593
- I can imagine.

07:43.637 --> 07:46.988
- And I asked for patience
with the ladies and got some,

07:47.031 --> 07:49.599
and some I didn't.
I asked for an understanding

07:49.643 --> 07:51.166
that these things
are complicated,

07:51.209 --> 07:54.125
that I was finding them out
in real time myself,

07:54.169 --> 07:56.519
and I don't have
all the answers

07:56.563 --> 07:58.216
and still do not have
all the answers to this day.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.827
- What do you think
at this moment

07:59.870 --> 08:02.133
is the biggest misconception
about you?

08:02.177 --> 08:05.572
- You know, there's a lot
of talk about me being cold

08:05.615 --> 08:08.792
and a lot of talk about me not
having empathy and sympathy.

08:08.836 --> 08:12.970
The truth is, I do, but I'm in
an almost impossible situation,

08:13.014 --> 08:14.972
and anyone that
has been wronged,

08:15.016 --> 08:17.279
I want them to be made whole.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.281
- You're talking about
the victim of Tom's--

08:19.324 --> 08:21.805
- Yeah, I'm talking about
the alleged victims

08:21.849 --> 08:24.852
of all of Tom's
alleged misdoings.

08:24.895 --> 08:28.943
And it's important
that people hear that from me.

08:28.986 --> 08:33.164
- Do you understand how people
watching could think

08:33.208 --> 08:35.036
that you don't have sympathy?
- Yes.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.864
- When you're reading
about victims,

08:36.907 --> 08:38.692
that's very hard to digest.

08:38.735 --> 08:42.696
- How do you think I feel?
Look at my life.

08:44.262 --> 08:47.570
- But they're also looking at
it through their own eyes,

08:47.614 --> 08:49.050
and they don't know
what I know,

08:49.093 --> 08:51.879
and they did not live
what I have lived through.

08:51.922 --> 08:55.360
- What was it like for you
watching the show back?

08:55.404 --> 08:57.928
- It was really, really hard.

08:57.972 --> 09:01.584
- What were your feelings
towards the other women

09:01.628 --> 09:04.718
as you watched their reaction
to it playing out?

09:04.761 --> 09:07.808
- Disappointment.
Anger.

09:07.851 --> 09:12.813
Sadness. And then some hope
and some love and some support.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.336
- I know that, Sutton,

09:14.379 --> 09:16.947
you spoke to an attorney
at some point during filming.

09:16.991 --> 09:19.254
- I want to be clear, though.
I didn't talk to my attorney.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.951
I talked to a friend
who is an attorney.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.170
- Okay.

09:22.213 --> 09:25.826
- I didn't call my attorney.
That's all.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.916
- Did any of the other women
speak to attorneys?

09:28.959 --> 09:30.221
You did, Crystal.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.571
- I did.
- Yeah.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.660
- Just for the first time
signed legal documents

09:33.703 --> 09:34.835
to be on TV.

09:34.878 --> 09:37.881
So for me
it was all very overwhelming.

09:37.925 --> 09:41.711
But I consult my lawyers
a lot in general.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.931
- Anyone else?
- I asked Faye's husband,

09:43.974 --> 09:45.323
<i>who is an attorney,
just to break down</i>

09:45.367 --> 09:47.848
<i>the "LA Times" article,
because it was so long.</i>

09:47.891 --> 09:50.894
- I'm sure your lawyers
have had a lot to say

09:50.938 --> 09:53.767
as the episodes have aired.

09:53.810 --> 09:56.813
Did they ever advise you
to quit the show?

09:56.857 --> 09:59.163
- They did. And then I said no.
- Why?

09:59.207 --> 10:00.991
- Because I have
nothing to hide.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.341
And they said, "Well, you know
that this

10:03.385 --> 10:04.821
can get flipped around you."

10:04.865 --> 10:07.041
- Meaning everything you say
can be used against you.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.957
- Everything can be parsed,
twisted, turned, and yes,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.264
possibly used against you.
Whether it is true or not,

10:13.308 --> 10:15.745
it almost doesn't even matter
at this point.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.660
- Did you ever think
of quitting the show?

10:17.704 --> 10:19.357
- Yes.
But I'm not a quitter,

10:19.401 --> 10:21.011
and I wanted to honor
my commitment.

10:21.055 --> 10:24.232
And I wasn't gonna run away
from what's coming at me.

10:24.275 --> 10:27.104
- How much did the fact
that you don't have

10:27.148 --> 10:33.371
your former husband's income
to rely on play into this?

10:33.415 --> 10:35.460
This is now your main job.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.898
- Yeah. Unfortunately, it is.

10:37.941 --> 10:43.120
You know, that is more now
of a consideration.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.905
Back then, while we were
shooting the show,

10:44.948 --> 10:46.863
I was literally
trying to survive.

10:46.907 --> 10:49.126
- Okay.
- So now that we're here, yes,

10:49.170 --> 10:51.955
that has come more
into consideration.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.435
- You have not been charged
with a crime.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.915
- No.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.438
- Yet if you look
on social media--

10:56.481 --> 10:57.961
- You would think I had.

10:58.005 --> 11:01.225
- And you would see
a lot of people saying,

11:01.269 --> 11:03.314
"She needs to be fired
from the show."

11:03.358 --> 11:04.707
<i>What's your reaction to that?</i>

11:04.751 --> 11:06.796
- No.
- No what? No why?

11:06.840 --> 11:08.276
- Why would I--why
should I be fired?

11:08.319 --> 11:10.234
Why are you presuming
that I've done something?

11:10.278 --> 11:13.194
Why aren't we letting
the legal process play out?

11:13.237 --> 11:14.412
You've heard one side

11:14.456 --> 11:17.198
and a lot of bull
on that side.

11:17.241 --> 11:19.504
Give me a chance
to defend myself. Watch me.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.768
I'm ready for the challenge.
Watch me do it.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.684
- All right, we're gonna be
right back after this.

11:26.947 --> 11:27.904
<i>Coming up...</i>

11:27.948 --> 11:29.210
<i>how was she as a tenant, Kyle?</i>

11:29.253 --> 11:30.951
- She did almost
burn my house down.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.996
- That is not my fault.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.128
- Sutton.
- We're gonna go to court.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.043
- Who was living there?

11:41.178 --> 11:42.353
- Welcome back to the

11:42.397 --> 11:46.096
"Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills" reunion.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.055
Sutton, you were kind of front
and center

11:48.098 --> 11:49.752
with a lot of the drama
this season.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.363
The big question is whether you
brought your face roller today

11:52.407 --> 11:53.538
to keep you calm.

11:53.582 --> 11:56.716
- It is in my trailer.
Roll it out.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.369
- It's in your trailer?
You may need it out here.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.544
- I know.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.503
- Well, some call her
over-the-top.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.940
Others call
her overly sensitive.

12:03.984 --> 12:07.639
But despite outside opinions,
Sutton is just trying

12:07.683 --> 12:12.688
to live her best life one
Sutty Buddy Butthole at a time.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.472
- That sounds so...
- Let's watch. I know.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.431
- Grindr-ish.
- I know.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.128
Sorry. I didn't like it up.

12:18.172 --> 12:21.044
- I didn't make it up either.
- You're going kind of slow.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.437
- Okay, wait,
I'll give her a little kick.

12:22.480 --> 12:26.006
- Yeah! Oh, my God!

12:26.049 --> 12:28.573
Sutton is fun.
She's a little odd.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.488
She's a little kooky.
But I like that.

12:30.532 --> 12:33.317
- I don't know what
you're doing over there.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.276
- Did I say it like that?
- Mr. Poppins.

12:35.319 --> 12:38.627
- When I saw that dadgum
doo-doo nail

12:38.670 --> 12:40.934
pointing at my face...
-

12:40.977 --> 12:44.024
- This helps me,

12:44.067 --> 12:46.069
because I feel
so uncomfortable.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.942
- Sutton should win an Oscar
for being a drama queen.

12:48.985 --> 12:52.075
- I pray to Jesus every day.
You think he'd throw me a bone.

12:52.119 --> 12:55.383
- What's up?
- I just need a vodka.

12:55.426 --> 13:00.518
- Oh, my God, I think Sutton
is more hormonal than my kids.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.172
And they're teenagers.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.739
- I'm telling you right now
as your friend

13:03.783 --> 13:05.610
you're being overly sensitive.
Look at me.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.221
- You are sensitive...
- pay attention to me.

13:07.264 --> 13:09.614
- I--okay. All right.
- No. Pay attention.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.616
<i>It is like taking care
of a toddler.</i>

13:11.660 --> 13:13.009
You gotta help her up.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.490
You have to put her
in the seat.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.362
- Oh! We did that very well
and elegantly.

13:18.406 --> 13:19.624
- She gets upset.

13:19.668 --> 13:22.062
She doesn't listen.
She does on and on.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.629
- I was ridiculous, crazy,
paranoid, and irrational,

13:24.673 --> 13:26.283
and too sensitive.
I've got it.

13:26.327 --> 13:27.763
- Yeah.
-

13:27.807 --> 13:29.156
- Why are you defensive
about that?

13:29.199 --> 13:30.374
- Defensive.
- Take that in.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.593
- Add the defensive.
- Defensive.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.160
- Oh, for the love of God.
I mean--

13:33.203 --> 13:34.552
- It's true.

13:34.596 --> 13:37.425
- I want to put a pacifier
in her mouth sometimes.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.122
- Bought a house,
and it's crazy,

13:39.166 --> 13:42.212
and I think it really, like,
released something in me.

13:42.256 --> 13:46.042
<i>After my divorce, I personally
was a shell of a person,</i>

13:46.086 --> 13:48.305
and ended up at the finish line
with a new house

13:48.349 --> 13:50.351
and a new Bentley
and great friends

13:50.394 --> 13:52.135
and living my best life.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.485
I'm a strong,
impassioned woman...

13:54.529 --> 13:57.271
That makes me want to cry.

13:57.314 --> 14:00.013
Who really doesn't
give a

14:03.320 --> 14:04.713
- Aww.
- I cried a lot.

14:04.756 --> 14:07.716
- You did cry a lot.
- And I was hormonal, I think.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.587
- Cody from Cupertino said,

14:09.631 --> 14:11.676
"Sutton, your therapist mom
seems tough as nails."

14:11.720 --> 14:13.069
- Whew!

14:13.113 --> 14:15.463
- What was it like being
psychoanalyzed growing up?

14:15.506 --> 14:19.162
- She's still very hard on me.
When I say something,

14:19.206 --> 14:21.382
she really wants to get
to the deeper meaning of it.

14:21.425 --> 14:24.646
Sometimes I just don't say
anything, 'cause it's easier.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.169
- What was her reaction

14:26.213 --> 14:27.692
to seeing you
on the show this season?

14:27.736 --> 14:30.478
- You know what's interesting,
when we did the flashback

14:30.521 --> 14:33.873
to talk about my dad,
she said nothing.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.613
I wish you had come
to the opening.

14:35.657 --> 14:38.181
There's a lot of Dad in this.

14:38.225 --> 14:41.097
Don't you miss him,
like, a little?

14:41.141 --> 14:45.188
- I don't miss him.
- What was her reaction

14:45.232 --> 14:47.321
to how you and Crystal
were not getting along?

14:47.364 --> 14:49.758
- She sent me a text,
and she said, you know,

14:49.801 --> 14:53.544
"With Crystal, you just need
to take her for what she is

14:53.588 --> 14:54.719
and not take things so..."

14:54.763 --> 14:56.243
- Personal.

14:56.286 --> 14:57.679
- "Personally." And she said,
"Don't do that.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.376
Y'all are just
kind of different people,

14:59.420 --> 15:01.465
and don't get so reactive."

15:01.509 --> 15:03.076
- And did you follow
that advice?

15:03.119 --> 15:04.555
- Yeah, I think I did.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.906
And it's also very funny,
one of my best friends said,

15:06.949 --> 15:08.864
"I think you and Crystal
are more alike than you know."

15:08.908 --> 15:10.387
- I've heard that too
from friends.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.867
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.261
'Cause I'm also
quite reactive too.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.698
- How has your store managed
during the pandemic?

15:16.741 --> 15:18.004
<i>- It's been great, actually.</i>

15:18.047 --> 15:19.396
It's growing bigger
and bigger--my business.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.702
Really growing.

15:20.745 --> 15:21.833
- Did you just point at me
when you said that?

15:21.877 --> 15:23.226
- Yes. It is a business.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.532
- Oh!
- It's growing.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.099
It's growing, actually,

15:26.142 --> 15:27.883
excrementally--more than
I thought that it would.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.798
- Did you shade her business?
- Did you shade her business?

15:29.841 --> 15:31.452
- Did I--what'd I say
in an interview?

15:31.495 --> 15:33.193
- Sutton doesn't really
have a business.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.455
- Well...
- No, but I'm saying.

15:34.498 --> 15:35.804
- She has her store.
- She has the shop.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.153
- She has her store...
- Okay.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.502
- But you know what I'm saying.
- Okay.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.591
- It's not like--like,
I don't understand that.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.158
Oh. Well, you had a store,

15:42.202 --> 15:43.594
so I didn't consider
a business at the time.

15:43.638 --> 15:44.813
- Uh-huh.
- But it is.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.597
- It is.
- Sutton, it was kind of funny.

15:46.641 --> 15:50.819
I mean, how would Amelia
and Porter vibe on a playdate?

15:50.862 --> 15:53.865
You said, "I don't think so."

15:53.909 --> 15:56.694
Yeah, I don't know
about that playdate.

15:56.738 --> 16:00.220
I don't know about that.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.351
- What was your
reaction to that?

16:01.395 --> 16:02.657
- It didn't feel great,

16:02.700 --> 16:03.832
because we're, like,
momma bears with our kids.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.225
- Yeah.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.618
- You know, so I, of course,
didn't love it. No.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.186
- They just grew up
in a different way.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.840
Porter didn't grow up
with Hollywood parents,

16:11.883 --> 16:13.363
so it's
a very different lifestyle.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.800
I didn't mean it in a bad way.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.977
- Sutton, have you moved
into your new house yet?

16:18.020 --> 16:21.632
- I did. We moved in last week.

16:21.676 --> 16:22.807
I'm in.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.940
This is where the
should go.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.421
This has been
one of the craziest journeys

16:27.464 --> 16:30.250
I think I've ever sone.
It feels amazing.

16:30.293 --> 16:31.903
<i>Every morning I wake up,
and I'm, like,</i>

16:31.947 --> 16:32.948
<i>this is amazing.</i>

16:32.992 --> 16:35.603
<i>It's so great. I'm so happy.</i>

16:35.646 --> 16:36.821
- So you wound up living

16:36.865 --> 16:39.650
at Kyle's
old Bel-Air house for how long?

16:39.694 --> 16:41.826
- Well, for a long time.
- Almost a year.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.611
- How was she
as a tenant, Kyle?

16:43.654 --> 16:45.482
- I was actually so happy
to have her there.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.615
She was a great tenant,

16:47.658 --> 16:49.878
although she did
almost burn my house down.

16:49.921 --> 16:53.403
- I did? I did? What did I do?

16:53.447 --> 16:55.536
Did I really? Stop it.
I did not.

16:55.579 --> 16:56.972
- No, I swear.
- I did? What did I do?

16:57.016 --> 16:59.801
- Well, because they just did,
like, a walkthrough,

16:59.844 --> 17:01.585
and they're like,

17:01.629 --> 17:03.892
"The house was almost burnt
down with the fireplace there."

17:03.935 --> 17:07.678
- Why? Well, I know,
I saw the--the smoky stuff.

17:07.722 --> 17:10.768
- The smoky--wait, no, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.032
They sent me the picture.
Wait, wait.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.685
- Yeah.
- Look. Wait, look.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.340
- Oh!
- Why it is doing that, though?

17:17.384 --> 17:18.994
- Because you almost burned
the house down!

17:19.038 --> 17:20.343
- Oh,

17:20.387 --> 17:21.736
- Oh!
- It is not my fault.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.868
<i>I just turned
the fireplace on.</i>

17:23.912 --> 17:26.219
- And so the house is standing
in Bel-Air,

17:26.262 --> 17:27.437
and it's on the market?

17:27.481 --> 17:28.743
- We took it off the market,

17:28.786 --> 17:30.440
'cause we have to do
some repairs right now.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.705
- Well, wouldn't that come out
of her security deposit?

17:34.749 --> 17:36.055
- I didn't know there was one.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.578
- We didn't ask for one.
- She didn't ask for one.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.449
- Because she was supposed
to be there only one month.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.538
- You know I'll fix anything.
- I know that.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.323
I know. That's why
I'm laughing about it.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.716
- It was not--that
is not my fault.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.196
We're gonna go to court.

17:47.240 --> 17:50.330
- Who was living there?
- Oh, good, someone else...

17:50.373 --> 17:52.549
- Right.
- Besides me.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.769
- All right, on that note,
we're gonna take a break.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.162
<i>Next...</i>

17:56.205 --> 17:57.076
- You didn't say anything
in the moment, and then--

17:57.119 --> 17:58.338
- You don't know that.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.731
- Let me finish, Garcelle!

18:06.607 --> 18:09.653
- So what look were you
going for today, Erika?

18:09.697 --> 18:12.917
- Hot. Single.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.745
- Speaking of single,
have you considered dating?

18:14.789 --> 18:15.790
Are you seeing anybody?

18:15.833 --> 18:17.052
- I'm trying!

18:17.096 --> 18:18.227
- Are you?
- Yes!

18:18.271 --> 18:20.099
I'd love--anybody, hello, help.
Yes.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.796
- What kind of guy
are you looking for?

18:21.839 --> 18:22.927
- Something with a big penis.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.146
- Ooh!
- Really?

18:24.190 --> 18:25.495
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:25.539 --> 18:26.757
- Yeah.
I would like some hot sex.

18:26.801 --> 18:27.976
- I'm sure you're gonna have

18:28.019 --> 18:29.543
a lot of takers
after that comment.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.110
- Well, I'm just saying.
- The DMs are--are open.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.502
- For sure.

18:32.546 --> 18:33.808
- Coming in.
- Okay.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.070
- Well, they are open.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.506
- Sutton,
you and your boyfriend

18:36.550 --> 18:38.726
Michael broke up, unfortunately.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.119
- Yes.
- What happened?

18:40.162 --> 18:42.121
- We're on a nice
Valentine's weekend,

18:42.164 --> 18:43.470
and he broke up weekend.

18:43.513 --> 18:44.732
- On the weekend?
- Oh, wow.

18:44.775 --> 18:45.950
- On Valentine's weekend?
- Yes.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.474
- That's not okay.
That's not okay.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.215
- So it wasn't that nice
of a Valentine's weekend. Wow.

18:49.258 --> 18:50.738
- Well, I guess it wasn't
that nice

18:50.781 --> 18:51.826
of a Valentine's weekend, then.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.697
- What reason did he give you?

18:53.741 --> 18:55.134
- That he--he said,
"I just can't."

18:55.177 --> 18:56.222
- "I just can't"?
- Yeah.

18:56.265 --> 18:57.701
- Wow.

18:57.745 --> 19:00.051
- There's really no comeback
to that. I was devastated.

19:00.095 --> 19:01.531
But now I'm not.
I'm dating.

19:01.575 --> 19:02.619
- Good.
- You are.

19:02.663 --> 19:03.881
- Good.
- Yes.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.100
- Who are you dating?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.536
- You know what?
I'm--I think I'm dating--

19:06.580 --> 19:07.972
- 'Cause I ain't got no dates.
What the

19:08.016 --> 19:10.279
- In my life. Dating's fun.
I highly recommend it.

19:10.323 --> 19:13.804
- Garcelle, Payton from Dallas
wants to know if your son Jade

19:13.848 --> 19:16.155
has come around to the idea
of you getting married again,

19:16.198 --> 19:18.200
or does he want to be
the main man in your life?

19:18.244 --> 19:19.810
- No,
I think that was a moment.

19:19.854 --> 19:22.944
I don't really believe that,
'cause they've met, you know,

19:22.987 --> 19:25.512
like, one or two people
that I've dated in the past,

19:25.555 --> 19:27.296
and they didn't seem
that protective.

19:27.340 --> 19:31.082
It felt like it was something
he was going through.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.084
But I think he'd be okay
if it was someone he knew

19:33.128 --> 19:35.130
that I was
genuinely happy with.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.741
- Well, this season,
Garcelle often felt like

19:37.785 --> 19:39.656
she didn't quite belong.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.182
Did "The Real" host
have herself some fake friends?

19:43.225 --> 19:47.273
Or was she not making
a "real" effort? Watch.

19:47.316 --> 19:50.798
- I don't know where I sit,
honestly, with this group.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.147
I feel like--in a way,

19:52.191 --> 19:53.844
feel like an outsider
a little bit.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.890
I think ever since I started
hanging with this group,

19:55.933 --> 19:58.545
I felt like there's
an inner circle to our group.

19:58.588 --> 20:01.025
I feel like the four of you
are together,

20:01.069 --> 20:03.071
and then me and Crystal
and Sutton

20:03.114 --> 20:04.855
are on the other side
of everything.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.553
- Why? Do you really?
- I do. I do.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.946
And I just feel like you guys
look out for each other,

20:08.990 --> 20:11.601
but I don't feel
like you look out for me.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.081
- Do you like the women
at this table?

20:13.124 --> 20:14.256
- Absolutely!

20:14.300 --> 20:15.953
- Okay.
- Some more than others.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.477
- Okay.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.654
Garcelle throws little darts,
and people are like, "Ow."

20:20.697 --> 20:23.961
- The regular goldfish is Kyle.
- Oh,

20:24.005 --> 20:27.051
<i>- Why is Kyle a goldfish?</i>

20:27.095 --> 20:30.707
It's ordinary.
She's longwinded.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.753
Should you give her a timer?

20:32.796 --> 20:34.233
- Is that another opportunity
for you

20:34.276 --> 20:37.061
to throw a little
passive-aggressive dig?

20:37.105 --> 20:40.151
Because of course
there's a smile.

20:40.195 --> 20:42.241
Do you have a problem
with me, Garcelle?

20:42.284 --> 20:44.852
I start to think, jeez,
you had a problem with Kyle,

20:44.895 --> 20:46.723
and then what you did
in Palm Springs,

20:46.767 --> 20:47.898
which in my opinion--

20:47.942 --> 20:50.379
- you with that.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.903
- That's from Crystal,
Kathy, and me.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.863
- Yes!
- Let me see. Let me see.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.168
- Wow!
- Wait.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.214
- Should I do it like this?
Yes!

20:59.258 --> 21:01.608
- That is beautiful.
- Thank you so much.

21:01.651 --> 21:02.957
- You're very welcome.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.176
- I think that we've all
really made an effort

21:05.220 --> 21:08.702
to make Garcelle feel
more comfortable in this group.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.138
It's Kyle's birthday.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.314
- Oh, I didn't know that!
- Here's the thing,

21:12.358 --> 21:16.144
friendship is a two-way street,
and she has to make an effort.

21:16.187 --> 21:21.280
- My whole life
I've had to try to fit in.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.238
- But you fit in here.
- You do fit in.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.109
- It doesn't always feel
like that.

21:25.153 --> 21:26.763
I walk in a room all the time,

21:26.807 --> 21:28.939
and I always
have to prove myself!

21:28.983 --> 21:30.376
Have you guys ever walked
into a room

21:30.419 --> 21:33.030
and felt like you're
the only one that's different?

21:33.074 --> 21:37.078
- Yeah.

21:37.121 --> 21:41.387
- Try it your whole life.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.649
Whew.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.346
- Garcelle, you were
so vulnerable

21:44.390 --> 21:46.957
when you opened up
to the group in Del Mar.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.264
Did you have
any follow-up conversations

21:49.308 --> 21:50.961
with anyone after that?

21:51.005 --> 21:54.313
- Rinna and Dorit came up to me
and said, "How did it feel?"

21:54.356 --> 21:56.837
And it made them see me
in a different way,

21:56.880 --> 21:58.360
and it made me feel like
I opened up

21:58.404 --> 22:00.057
differently too to them.

22:00.101 --> 22:01.668
- Did you feel closer
to Garcelle

22:01.711 --> 22:02.712
after she opened up that night?

22:02.756 --> 22:03.844
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.367
- Yeah. I mean, you know,
Garcelle was

22:05.411 --> 22:10.024
one of those people that I felt
an immediate bond towards.

22:10.067 --> 22:14.158
I think that Garcelle
can be passively provocative,

22:14.202 --> 22:17.379
and it doesn't really give
someone a chance to respond

22:17.423 --> 22:18.989
or defend themselves.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.905
I liked that she opened up
and was vulnerable in Del Mar,

22:21.949 --> 22:24.821
because I really believe
that showing that vulnerability

22:24.865 --> 22:27.041
was really real and raw,

22:27.084 --> 22:30.784
and it was like this part
of her which I had felt

22:30.827 --> 22:33.439
that she was doing
deliberately,

22:33.482 --> 22:35.354
again, passively provocative,

22:35.397 --> 22:38.139
almost to be relevant,
to be interesting.

22:38.182 --> 22:40.141
- What? I don't need
to do anything to be relevant.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.360
Let me just say that.

22:41.403 --> 22:44.188
- Okay. Well, I felt like
you've taken jabs

22:44.232 --> 22:47.366
and swipes at me.
And then I confronted you,

22:47.409 --> 22:50.369
and then you made it seem
that I was coming after you.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.979
In that moment,

22:52.022 --> 22:53.850
I used a word that I shouldn't
have used, and it was wrong.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.156
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah, and--

22:55.199 --> 22:57.027
- And I need an apology
for that, honestly.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.421
- You're making a lot
of jabs at me.

22:59.465 --> 23:05.035
- Have I?
- It's like a bully.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.734
- I need an apology for that.
I am not a bully.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.213
- Garcelle.
- Yes.

23:09.257 --> 23:11.346
- You didn't give me a chance
to actually apologize.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.348
- Because it was hurtful.
- I completely--

23:13.392 --> 23:15.089
- It was hurtful...
- Garcelle, I raised it--

23:15.132 --> 23:16.743
- And also unnecessary.

23:16.786 --> 23:17.918
- I raised it. I raised it.
- Okay.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.441
- That was the wrong word.
- Okay.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.748
- And I want you to understand
that popped in my head,

23:21.791 --> 23:26.274
because an element of a bully
is incessive. It's incessant.

23:26.317 --> 23:29.886
I felt like the jabs you were
doing at me were incessant.

23:29.930 --> 23:33.368
- You got absolutely hazed
for calling her a bully.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.891
- Right.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.589
- Bridget from Arkansas said,

23:36.632 --> 23:39.940
after witnessing Erika verbally
attack Teddy, Eileen, Sutton,

23:39.983 --> 23:42.029
and being on
the receiving end yourself,

23:42.072 --> 23:46.033
why call Garcelle a bully
and not Erika?

23:46.076 --> 23:48.470
King Danielle said Dorit
using the word "bully"

23:48.514 --> 23:50.429
is an attempt to paint Garcelle

23:50.472 --> 23:52.474
into the angry
Black woman stereotype.

23:52.518 --> 23:53.954
That's a new low.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.999
So, Dorit, what's your response
to all this?

23:56.043 --> 23:58.349
- Okay, well, that's very
layered, you know,

23:58.393 --> 24:00.003
so let me just break this down.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.789
First of all, that was not
at all in an effort

24:02.832 --> 24:04.443
to paint that picture.

24:04.486 --> 24:07.576
And like I just said,
an element of the word "bully"

24:07.620 --> 24:10.013
is incessant,
and when Erika had had moments

24:10.057 --> 24:11.798
with all of the ones
that you mentioned,

24:11.841 --> 24:13.016
they were
all isolated incidents.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.235
- Oh, come on.

24:14.278 --> 24:16.933
- This was over
a period of months.

24:16.977 --> 24:19.283
Listen, I will own
all day long

24:19.327 --> 24:21.372
that I can choose words poorly.
I wish I could take it back.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.026
- It's okay.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.072
- And it wasn't the right word,
and I'm very sorry for that.

24:25.115 --> 24:26.421
- Thank you.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.598
- But Garcelle says a lot
in her confessionals,

24:29.642 --> 24:31.948
but she doesn't say
it directly to your face.

24:31.992 --> 24:34.298
- That's not true.
- I'd have to agree with Dorit.

24:34.342 --> 24:35.474
- We all do it.
- I mean, but you all do it.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.692
- We all do it.

24:36.736 --> 24:37.606
- We all do it.
We absolutely all do it.

24:37.650 --> 24:38.955
- We all do it.
- Well...

24:38.999 --> 24:39.956
- You seem to do it the most.
- Yeah.

24:40.000 --> 24:40.957
- No, I don't
think that's true.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.132
- And there's a lot of times--

24:42.176 --> 24:43.873
- You're the most comfortable
doing it.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.310
- You don't say much when we're
together, or to someone's face,

24:46.354 --> 24:47.921
and then you'll say it
in the confessional.

24:47.964 --> 24:51.490
- First I say too much,
and then I don't say enough.

24:51.533 --> 24:52.839
Like, I can't win with you.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.144
- It's not direct.
- I can't win.

24:54.188 --> 24:55.972
- No, you can.
- It is direct. It is direct.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.365
- No, it's not.
- I've said to you, Dorit--

24:57.408 --> 24:58.975
- It's very passive.
- Dorit, I've said to you--

24:59.019 --> 25:00.368
- And it's with a smile.
- Come on.

25:00.411 --> 25:01.891
- You've said--you said
you want her to be direct,

25:01.935 --> 25:03.980
but then you accuse of her
of throwing darts, so...

25:04.024 --> 25:06.156
- Thank you.
- I want her to be direct.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.418
I don't want her
to throw darts.

25:07.462 --> 25:08.594
Throwing darts
is not being direct, Andy.

25:08.637 --> 25:10.160
- Okay.

25:10.204 --> 25:11.510
- When you have an issue
with someone, you look at them,

25:11.553 --> 25:12.902
you tell them
you have an issue.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.469
- Okay.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.037
- You don't throw a passive-
aggressive jab with a smile.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.429
- Okay.
- Oh, please.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.519
And can I just say this?
Don't we all want to grow?

25:20.562 --> 25:21.998
If somebody keeps saying
to you,

25:22.042 --> 25:23.913
don't you want to go
look at it and go--

25:23.957 --> 25:25.611
- Not at this age, honey.
I'm set.

25:25.654 --> 25:27.656
- I said you talk too much.

25:27.700 --> 25:31.225
You go for my integrity
and call me inauthentic

25:31.268 --> 25:32.966
<i>and call me a bully,
which you've...</i>

25:33.009 --> 25:34.402
- Apologized for.
- Apologized for..

25:34.445 --> 25:35.403
- Apologized.
- So we're gonna

25:35.446 --> 25:36.535
put that aside,

25:36.578 --> 25:37.536
and we're really gonna
put it aside.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.928
- Great.
- That's nice.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.060
- I'm not one to bring it
back up again. All right?

25:40.103 --> 25:41.975
- Really? That's nice.
- Rinna, stop.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.020
- That's great.
- We'll get to it.

25:44.064 --> 25:45.544
Like, hold on, girl.
Hold on.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.197
- Garcelle, I'll do
whatever I want.

25:47.241 --> 25:49.591
Don't you tell me
to do anything, okay?

25:49.635 --> 25:52.072
Thanks. Don't--

25:52.115 --> 25:53.552
- I can say anything
I want to say.

25:53.595 --> 25:54.596
- You go--
- So can I!

25:54.640 --> 25:56.903
- So can all of us!

25:56.946 --> 25:58.382
- We all can!
- Okay.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.210
- Don't you tell me
to do a thing.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.911
- Crystal, do you think
that Garcelle has a tendency

26:04.954 --> 26:06.608
to throw jabs and run away?

26:06.652 --> 26:09.568
- I'll just refer to my dinner,
like, when she says

26:09.611 --> 26:11.178
you don't say it in front,

26:11.221 --> 26:13.615
and then you made that, like,
jab at me.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.051
- What did I say about you?

26:15.095 --> 26:16.575
- That you don't--you
didn't know who I was.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.533
- I've never heard of her.
Ever.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.013
- How about this?

26:20.056 --> 26:22.711
Before I met Crystal,
I didn't know Crystal.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.539
I knew Rob Minkoff.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.149
- I'm glad you brought up
the dinner,

26:26.193 --> 26:28.499
but that wasn't even the jab
I was talking about.

26:28.543 --> 26:32.025
You guys were all talking
about Sutton. You were there.

26:32.068 --> 26:33.635
You didn't say anything
in the moment, and then--

26:33.679 --> 26:36.464
- You don't know that.
- Let me finish, Garcelle!

26:36.507 --> 26:37.726
- Oh!

26:37.770 --> 26:40.511
- This is the second time
you've cut me off!

26:40.555 --> 26:41.774
I'm gonna make a point.

26:41.817 --> 26:43.340
- That's very loud.
- Make a point, Dorit.

26:46.387 --> 26:48.955
<i>♪</i>

26:51.784 --> 26:54.134
- You guys were all talking
about Sutton. You were there.

26:54.177 --> 26:55.701
You didn't say anything
in the moment, and then--

26:55.744 --> 26:57.441
- You don't know that.
- Let me finish, Garcelle!

26:57.485 --> 26:58.660
- Oh!

26:58.704 --> 27:00.880
- This is the second time
you've cut me off!

27:00.923 --> 27:02.490
I'm gonna make a point.

27:02.533 --> 27:03.752
- Make a point, Dorit.

27:03.796 --> 27:06.450
- Flash to your confessional,
and you said,

27:06.494 --> 27:10.106
"Why are they saying all
these things? I'm Team Sutton."

27:10.150 --> 27:12.239
- Yeah. She's finally
getting a voice.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.284
- I think her voice
is very awkward.

27:14.328 --> 27:15.677
- Why are they saying this
in front of me?

27:15.721 --> 27:19.638
They know I'm Team Sutton.
Like, come on.

27:19.681 --> 27:23.554
- Why not in that moment, say,
"Guys, I don't agree with this.

27:23.598 --> 27:24.904
"And, you guys,
I'm friends with Sutton.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.253
I don't appreciate this."

27:26.296 --> 27:27.558
- Why are you talking

27:27.602 --> 27:30.257
about something
that you weren't even there?

27:30.300 --> 27:32.476
- I want to move on
to Rinna and Garcelle.

27:32.520 --> 27:38.308
But before I do, where do you
two stand, Dorit and Garcelle?

27:38.352 --> 27:39.440
- Well, the ball
is in your court.

27:39.483 --> 27:40.659
- Okay.

27:40.702 --> 27:41.877
- I would like to move on.
I thought we did.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.923
- I would like
to move on as well.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.838
Like, I don't dislike her.

27:45.881 --> 27:48.275
- Okay.
- At all.

27:48.318 --> 27:50.494
- "I don't dislike her at all."
- I mean--okay.

27:50.538 --> 27:51.670
- Great.
- I mean, no.

27:51.713 --> 27:52.975
- That's really convincing,
Garcelle.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.324
- Sounds great.
- You know what I'm saying?

27:54.368 --> 27:55.499
I don't--
- Is that a double negative?

27:55.543 --> 27:57.371
- Yeah, I think
that's what it is.

27:57.414 --> 27:58.807
I don't have anything against
Dorit, honestly.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.200
- Okay. Okay.

28:00.243 --> 28:01.462
- I really don't.

28:01.505 --> 28:04.160
- So you two
are clean right now.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.901
I want to move on to...

28:05.945 --> 28:07.468
- Fish.
- Lisa Rinna.

28:07.511 --> 28:11.298
And Garcelle, you struggled
with the ups and downs

28:11.341 --> 28:14.736
of your 20-year friendship
with Lisa Rinna.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.913
Do you think you've earned back
your friendship with Garcelle?

28:17.957 --> 28:20.655
- Well, I certainly
did everything that I could.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.702
You know, I think at this point
you'd have to ask Garcelle,

28:23.745 --> 28:25.007
'cause I really tried.

28:25.051 --> 28:27.923
I think Garcelle has
some expectations from me.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.316
- She threw you
a birthday party.

28:29.359 --> 28:30.447
- Yeah.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.927
- And she brought you sauce.
- Yeah.

28:31.971 --> 28:33.799
- Did you take those as her
playing chess,

28:33.842 --> 28:37.324
or did you take them as,
"Wow, she's making an effort"?

28:37.367 --> 28:38.673
- That's a really good
question.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.457
If I'm gonna be really honest,

28:40.501 --> 28:44.592
I'm not sure how
I took them, honestly.

28:44.635 --> 28:48.291
Those were lovely things to do.
I just don't trust.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.206
And when you don't trust--

28:50.250 --> 28:53.601
- Should she stop reaching out,
because you don't trust?

28:53.644 --> 28:55.037
You know what I'm saying?

28:55.081 --> 28:56.299
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like, should she stop that?

28:56.343 --> 28:57.561
- Yeah. I don't know
what to say, honestly.

28:57.605 --> 28:58.911
- 'Cause she's gonna
come to a point--

28:58.954 --> 29:00.390
- I've never--

29:00.434 --> 29:01.391
- I mean, let me speak for you
for one second.

29:01.435 --> 29:02.871
- You can speak. You can.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.177
- I think she's gonna come
to a point where she's like,

29:04.220 --> 29:05.221
"Hey, I've really tried."
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:05.265 --> 29:06.353
- "She doesn't trust me."
- I tried.

29:06.396 --> 29:07.920
- I understand that.
- That's enough.

29:07.963 --> 29:09.008
- You know what I'm saying?
There's gonna be a point...

29:09.051 --> 29:10.052
- Your birthday was
very genuine.

29:10.096 --> 29:10.923
- Oh, I know that.
- The text thread

29:10.966 --> 29:12.011
amongst all of us...
- I know that.

29:12.054 --> 29:13.447
- I think--
- Was super sweet.

29:13.490 --> 29:14.883
- I think if I could just say,
you know,

29:14.927 --> 29:17.843
I just feel like you
break the chain with me.

29:17.886 --> 29:19.279
For whatever reason,

29:19.322 --> 29:21.368
you don't want to go
a little bit further.

29:21.411 --> 29:24.545
And I--and I have to just
take that in now. I really do.

29:24.588 --> 29:25.807
- Okay. I'm sorry.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.461
- Do you--do you want
to punish her

29:27.504 --> 29:28.636
for the way she treated you?

29:28.679 --> 29:29.855
- No, I'm done with that.
- Okay.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.291
- I mean, Denise can
fight her own battles.

29:31.334 --> 29:32.422
- Okay.

29:32.466 --> 29:34.337
- I mean, I'm really
done with that.

29:34.381 --> 29:37.819
- Okay. But to bring that up
at the final party--

29:37.863 --> 29:43.520
- I would love to see a reach
out to Denise at some point.

29:43.564 --> 29:47.350
- It's, like, we went for four
months, and you have to bring

29:47.394 --> 29:49.570
Denise up again.
When are you gonna let it go?

29:49.613 --> 29:50.789
- I have let it go.
- When?

29:50.832 --> 29:52.355
- Just now.

29:52.399 --> 29:53.879
- Okay, thank the Lord Jesus.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.358
- I don't care.

29:55.402 --> 29:56.490
- Thank the Lord Jesus!
Hallelujah!

29:56.533 --> 29:57.752
- I don't care.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.406
- I hope I never hear
that again from you.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.016
- You will not hear it
from me, girl.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.583
- Let me ask you a question.

30:02.626 --> 30:04.977
Garcelle, you expressed
your disappointment in Rinna

30:05.020 --> 30:07.631
for not standing up for you
throughout the season.

30:07.675 --> 30:10.373
What were you expecting of her?

30:10.417 --> 30:12.027
Given that you went into
saying,

30:12.071 --> 30:13.986
"Okay, we're on pause,
I'm leery..."

30:14.029 --> 30:15.465
- "I don't trust you."

30:15.509 --> 30:16.945
- "I don't know,
I don't trust you,"

30:16.989 --> 30:18.860
what did you expect of her,
that she didn't give you?

30:18.904 --> 30:21.950
- I didn't expect for her to,
like, stop everything

30:21.994 --> 30:25.040
and come and save me.
I don't need that. I felt like

30:25.084 --> 30:29.915
when we were at your lip kit
launch that--when Dorit

30:29.958 --> 30:33.657
and I had our incident,
for lack of a better word--and

30:33.701 --> 30:35.050
I thought maybe Rinna
would have been like,

30:35.094 --> 30:38.967
"Well"--something, anything.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.273
- But I agreed with Dorit.
- Anything.

30:40.316 --> 30:42.623
- You know? So I wouldn't
have had your side,

30:42.666 --> 30:44.799
because I thought what
Dorit was saying was correct.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.931
- Gotcha.
-

30:45.974 --> 30:47.933
I feel like the last
couple of months

30:47.976 --> 30:50.109
you've been making
a lot of jabs at me.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.111
What is going on?

30:52.154 --> 30:53.590
- You know, Sutton,

30:53.634 --> 30:56.811
I'm curious your reaction
to this conversation.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.682
You know, I mean,
Garcelle's your--

30:58.726 --> 31:00.641
- Yeah, and I think--
we've talked about this.

31:00.684 --> 31:05.907
I think one of the trust things
is Lisa not having my back too

31:05.951 --> 31:07.822
and her saying, you know,
"Lisa's your friend,

31:07.866 --> 31:10.651
and she's not
helping you out at all."

31:10.694 --> 31:13.436
- Listen, if I up,
or I'd been mean to you,

31:13.480 --> 31:15.482
or if I'd done something,
I'd understand it."

31:15.525 --> 31:18.659
- You--someone told me
that you said

31:18.702 --> 31:21.618
that I should have never
brought race into this show,

31:21.662 --> 31:25.840
that this show is not
that kind of show.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.494
And that really bothered me.

31:27.537 --> 31:29.017
- Well, if that were the case,
you should have come to me

31:29.061 --> 31:30.584
and asked me that,
because I did not say that.

31:30.627 --> 31:31.802
- Oh, please, there's so many
other things

31:31.846 --> 31:33.239
you guys don't come to me
and say directly.

31:33.282 --> 31:34.849
- Yeah, but that's a big one.
- That's a big one.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.372
- No, that is a big one.
- That's a big one, Garcelle.

31:36.416 --> 31:37.721
- And you know what?

31:37.765 --> 31:39.375
- Garcelle, I would never say
that, by the way.

31:39.419 --> 31:42.944
- I don't know that.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.512
- Garcelle, you have it out
for me, and I want to know why.

31:45.555 --> 31:46.861
- I don't have it out
for you, Rinna.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.428
- Why?
- No. But when you--

31:48.471 --> 31:49.472
- Why?
- When I heard that...

31:49.516 --> 31:50.996
- Why?
- That pissed me off.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.475
- Well then why didn't you
come to me and say,

31:52.519 --> 31:54.913
"Rinna, what are you doing"?

32:00.744 --> 32:03.008
- Someone told me that you said

32:03.051 --> 32:05.793
that I should have never
brought race into this show,

32:05.836 --> 32:08.752
that this show is not
that kind of show.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.276
And that pissed me off.

32:10.319 --> 32:11.755
- Well then why didn't you
come to me and say,

32:11.799 --> 32:13.061
"Rinna, what are you doing"?

32:13.105 --> 32:14.976
- So you're gonna blame me
for something that--

32:15.020 --> 32:16.108
- I'm not blaming you.

32:16.151 --> 32:17.631
- For being upset
about something.

32:17.674 --> 32:19.328
- I want to know why you were
so mean to me all season,

32:19.372 --> 32:21.156
and you go, "I heard that,

32:21.200 --> 32:22.679
and that's why
I was mean to you."

32:22.723 --> 32:24.203
- The race thing
really bothered me.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.682
- I bet.
- But I never said it!

32:25.726 --> 32:26.857
So, where'd you get it?

32:26.901 --> 32:28.294
- I'm not saying a word
about that.

32:28.337 --> 32:29.730
- You know, it's
pretty unbelievable--

32:29.773 --> 32:30.992
- But I was sent some texts.
- That's really awful.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.428
- You guys,
that's pretty unbelievable

32:32.472 --> 32:33.734
that you just did that.

32:33.777 --> 32:34.953
- Okay, so not you're gonna
turn it around...

32:34.996 --> 32:36.302
- I'm not turning it
around, honey.

32:36.345 --> 32:37.346
- And use it, when I was
the one that was hurt.

32:37.390 --> 32:38.652
- You turned it around.

32:38.695 --> 32:39.783
- No, I didn't.
- You just did this.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.002
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.221
- No, I didn't.
Why is this rattling you?

32:42.264 --> 32:43.613
- You know why?
- Why is it rattling you?

32:43.657 --> 32:45.050
- Because you were

32:45.093 --> 32:47.008
to me all season, and
you're not being honest why.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.271
That's not why you were
to me. Why were you--

32:49.315 --> 32:50.969
- Why was I to you?
- You tell me. Why?

32:51.012 --> 32:52.187
- Because I don't trust you.
I didn't trust you.

32:52.231 --> 32:53.667
- Okay, there we go!
Then let's go there!

32:53.710 --> 32:55.190
- I've been saying that!

32:55.234 --> 32:56.365
- But here's the thing,
why didn't you just say to me,

32:56.409 --> 32:57.714
"Lisa, I don't want
to be your friend.

32:57.758 --> 32:59.368
I don't trust you"?
why did you say--

32:59.412 --> 33:00.848
- I've that to you.

33:00.891 --> 33:02.415
- No, but you say,
"I want to move on.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.459
Let's move on."
And by the way--

33:03.503 --> 33:05.113
- I said I'm open to moving on.

33:05.157 --> 33:06.985
- But you said--
- I said I'm open to moving on.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.856
- Okay. After the "Watch
What Happens Live" moment

33:08.899 --> 33:11.163
when you basically
wanted to say,

33:11.206 --> 33:13.730
"I want--we want Lisa Rinna
fired so Denise can come back."

33:13.774 --> 33:15.080
- No, I didn't say that.

33:15.123 --> 33:16.733
- Are you in touch with Denise
at all these days?

33:16.777 --> 33:17.952
- I am.
- You are?

33:17.996 --> 33:19.084
- I am.
- And--

33:19.127 --> 33:20.346
- I think she wants
to come back.

33:20.389 --> 33:22.304
- Oh, really?

33:22.348 --> 33:24.350
- Somebody's gotta go, though.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.700
- Oh!

33:26.743 --> 33:30.399
Are her initials LR?
- Oh! I did not say--

33:30.443 --> 33:31.835
- What you said was--

33:31.879 --> 33:32.880
- I said--I know
exactly what I said.

33:32.923 --> 33:34.142
- You said
Denise would come back...

33:34.186 --> 33:35.317
- Right.
- If someone else left.

33:35.361 --> 33:36.927
- Yes.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.320
- And were you referring
to Lisa Rinna?

33:38.364 --> 33:40.148
- I was referring
to Lisa Rinna,

33:40.192 --> 33:42.020
but you said LR, Andy Cohen.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.325
- I said,
"Are her initials LR?"

33:43.369 --> 33:44.674
- You did.

33:44.718 --> 33:45.936
- And I figured--yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.025
- But you were
referring to her.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.069
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.505
- So let me ask you
a question.

33:49.549 --> 33:50.898
If you don't trust me,
why did you reach out to me

33:50.941 --> 33:52.856
after that and say,
"Let's make things better"?

33:52.900 --> 33:54.945
- No, you reached out
to me and said...

33:54.989 --> 33:56.425
- And said that hurt my--
- I threatened your job.

33:56.469 --> 33:57.426
- I said and it
hurt my feelings.

33:57.470 --> 33:58.819
- You said a lot of things.

33:58.862 --> 34:00.081
- Yeah.
- You said a lot of things.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.648
- Because--and
they're all true.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.432
- And then when I clarified
it--and when I clarified it,

34:03.476 --> 34:05.043
you were like,

34:05.086 --> 34:06.914
"Oh, I guess
I was just in my feelings."

34:06.957 --> 34:08.785
- I was.
- Okay.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.049
- But you know what?
What you just did

34:11.092 --> 34:13.268
and what you just threw down,
the insinuation...

34:13.312 --> 34:14.487
- Yeah.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.097
- It shows exactly who you are.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.926
- So you want to tell me that
every single one of you

34:18.969 --> 34:21.102
were truly okay--the fact
that all of a sudden now

34:21.146 --> 34:23.148
we're talking about different
things that you never--

34:23.191 --> 34:24.410
- I'm okay with it.

34:24.453 --> 34:25.802
- That you never had
to talk about before.

34:25.846 --> 34:27.195
- It is what it is.
- Wait, but you do add

34:27.239 --> 34:30.068
a completely different
perspective, you know.

34:30.111 --> 34:32.809
- And that's the real world.
That's why it's great.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.376
- I'm sorry.
- This is real life.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.464
- Well, I just don't understand
why you had to say that,

34:35.508 --> 34:37.118
because it's not true.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.293
- She would have loved
if you'd come to her, babe.

34:38.337 --> 34:39.468
- Okay, well then say
it's not true...

34:39.512 --> 34:40.904
- It's not true!
- And drop it.

34:40.948 --> 34:42.123
- But she never had a chance
before today.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.081
- Then say it's not true
and drop--okay,

34:43.124 --> 34:44.343
well,
I'm just telling her now.

34:44.386 --> 34:45.866
- And you know what?
- She can say it now.

34:45.909 --> 34:49.043
- I'd like an apology
for you insinuating that to me.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.089
Because Garcelle,
I would never say that.

34:51.132 --> 34:53.352
I was happy that
you came on the show.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.528
I like you.
Why would you insinuate that?

34:55.571 --> 34:57.095
- I don't know.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.227
- Unless you asked me yourself,
"Lisa, did you say that?"

34:59.271 --> 35:01.969
Or, "Lisa, do you feel that?"
And I'd answer it.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.275
- Would you really tell me

35:03.318 --> 35:05.407
I wish you hadn't
brought up race on the show?

35:05.451 --> 35:07.496
Would you have actually
said that to my face?

35:07.540 --> 35:09.977
- Yeah, I would have.
- Yeah. This one? Yeah.

35:10.020 --> 35:14.590
- Look who you're talking to.
- I guess as I wrap this out

35:14.634 --> 35:20.292
I do wonder--I don't know
where you two go from here.

35:20.335 --> 35:22.120
- I don't know.
- Why can't we move on?

35:22.163 --> 35:23.860
- I don't know.
- You--

35:23.904 --> 35:25.123
- Do you want to move on?

35:25.166 --> 35:27.125
- I've said that
the entire season!

35:27.168 --> 35:29.301
- What would you like to see me
do that would look like--

35:29.344 --> 35:31.041
- Just be the Garcelle
I knew before.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.173
You know, I gotta
tell you one thing--

35:32.217 --> 35:33.479
- You just be the Lisa
I know before.

35:33.522 --> 35:34.915
- I'd like to be.

35:34.958 --> 35:36.438
- What happened to the Lisa
I knew before.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.353
- I'd like to tell you.
- You were warm. You were fun.

35:38.397 --> 35:40.138
- Am I not warm?
- You were supportive.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.574
- Am I not fun?
- Yes are.

35:41.617 --> 35:43.402
- Am I not supportive?
- You are, but you're--look,

35:43.445 --> 35:45.012
she's gonna call you
on everything.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.232
That's who she is. I mean--

35:47.275 --> 35:48.798
- I mean, Harry's been
watching,

35:48.842 --> 35:50.539
and he said to me--he goes,
"What happened to Garcelle?"

35:50.583 --> 35:52.193
- Oh, stop.

35:52.237 --> 35:55.065
- He said, "She looks
so unhappy. Is she okay?"

35:55.109 --> 35:56.197
- Oh, stop.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.199
- I'm not kidding.
- Do I look unhappy?

35:58.243 --> 36:00.158
- I don't see you look
miserable,

36:00.201 --> 36:02.508
but I feel like you check out.

36:02.551 --> 36:05.859
- I check out?
Honey, I show up.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.077
- So do I!
- I show up.

36:07.121 --> 36:08.296
I'm not saying
you don't show up.

36:08.340 --> 36:09.428
- I show up.

36:09.471 --> 36:11.038
- But why do you
hold it with me?

36:11.081 --> 36:13.214
You don't hold it with Kyle.
You don't hold it with Dorit.

36:13.258 --> 36:14.476
- I don't know.
- Why do you hold it with me?

36:14.520 --> 36:15.999
- I don't know.

36:16.043 --> 36:17.305
- Maybe because you've
known her the longest.

36:17.349 --> 36:19.220
- Maybe. Maybe my expectations
are higher.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.439
- Uh-huh.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.092
- Maybe my experiences
are higher.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.007
- Do you think that there
would be any way--'cause

36:24.051 --> 36:25.313
I would love to move on,

36:25.357 --> 36:27.054
because when you and I
are good, we're great.

36:27.097 --> 36:28.229
- So good.
- We're so funny.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.057
- So good.
- I love you so much.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.885
I really do. I know
it doesn't seem like I do.

36:31.928 --> 36:33.234
- I'm sorry.
- No, it doesn't.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.583
- But I get really
mad at you, though!

36:34.627 --> 36:35.802
I do a little.

36:35.845 --> 36:37.238
- You can be mad at you.
I'm mad at you!

36:37.282 --> 36:38.500
- Okay. Okay, so what do we do?

36:40.154 --> 36:41.373
- Well, it seems like
one of the ways...

36:41.416 --> 36:44.027
to rebuilt trust
is just time.

36:44.071 --> 36:45.246
- Right.
- You know, and so--

36:45.290 --> 36:46.552
- What have I said? Yes!

36:46.595 --> 36:49.119
- This has now been a year
where you've been...

36:49.163 --> 36:50.295
- In action.
- Rebuilding.

36:50.338 --> 36:52.993
- Yeah.
- And so--

36:53.036 --> 36:56.344
- Garcelle, could we please--
- I need a roller.

36:56.388 --> 36:57.824
- Oh, yeah,
I'll let you borrow mine.

36:57.867 --> 36:59.260
- Garcelle, let me come sit
next to you for a second.

36:59.304 --> 37:00.392
I want--
- Oh, gosh.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.698
- I really, really--no,
I'm serious.

37:02.742 --> 37:03.917
I'm done with this.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.224
- I want to move on with you.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.921
I know you don't
trust me.

37:07.964 --> 37:10.445
I know you don't
like me. But give me a chance.

37:10.489 --> 37:14.971
- Just give me a chance.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.234
- You got it.
- There.

37:16.277 --> 37:17.583
- Wow!
- Just give me a chance!

37:17.626 --> 37:19.019
- But do you mean it?
Garcelle, do you mean it?

37:19.062 --> 37:20.150
- What am I gonna do?
She's right here!

37:20.194 --> 37:21.413
No, I'm serious.

37:21.456 --> 37:22.588
- Dorit, don't push it.

37:22.631 --> 37:24.111
- I'm not talking
to you right now.

37:24.154 --> 37:26.244
- Shut up.
- Do you mean it?

37:26.287 --> 37:28.071
- We've got to move on.
- Let's move on.

37:28.115 --> 37:29.551
- Life is too short.

37:29.595 --> 37:30.987
- Agree.
- Stop this bull

37:31.031 --> 37:33.990
- And mean it.
- And let's move on!

37:34.034 --> 37:36.428
- Garcelle, did you
like the sauce?

37:36.471 --> 37:38.560
- The sauce was great,
which is why I loved it

37:38.604 --> 37:40.388
so much that she brought it up.

37:40.432 --> 37:41.955
- Lookit,
I'm gonna grab her hard

37:41.998 --> 37:44.131
and say you're
not going anywhere.

37:44.174 --> 37:46.307
Now, you stop this,
and let's move on, God damn it!

37:46.351 --> 37:47.569
- Let's move on!
- Aww.

37:47.613 --> 37:49.223
- I like you too much...
- Me too.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.529
- To do this anymore.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.313
If I didn't like you,
I'd say, "you,

37:52.357 --> 37:53.662
go away." [bleep],
you know I would.

37:53.706 --> 37:54.750
- Yeah, I know you do.
- Okay, can we be done?

37:54.794 --> 37:56.274
- Are we done?
- Yeah.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.318
- We're not doing it anymore.

37:57.362 --> 37:58.580
- Can we go
on commercial break?

37:58.624 --> 37:59.755
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

37:59.799 --> 38:01.279
- We're gonna take a break.

38:01.322 --> 38:03.759
This is--this is positive.
We're ending on positivity.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.718
- Oh, my gosh!
- We're gonna be right back.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.589
- Oh, come on now.
Lisa, no, not the legs.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.722
- Watch out; you're gonna
kick Sutton in the face.

38:09.765 --> 38:12.028
- Oh, gosh! <i>
- Coming up next...</i>

38:12.072 --> 38:15.467
- I've said to Tom, "If you are
in love with someone else,

38:15.510 --> 38:18.426
divorce me and go be with her."

38:18.470 --> 38:20.298
- He said?

38:25.694 --> 38:27.130
- Welcome back to the

38:27.174 --> 38:28.610
"Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills" reunion.

38:28.654 --> 38:31.831
We are joined by the one
and only Kathy Hilton.

38:31.874 --> 38:34.355
- Yeah!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

38:34.399 --> 38:35.530
welcome to the stage.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.663
- And I have a few
notes in case,

38:37.706 --> 38:39.447
'cause I wanted to address
a few things.

38:39.491 --> 38:40.622
- We call these receipts,
Kathy.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.407
- Well, I see Garcelle's name.

38:42.450 --> 38:46.324
- Bring it, Kathy.
Bring it, bitch.

38:46.367 --> 38:52.634
- Kathy, do you recognize
where we're sitting tonight?

38:52.678 --> 38:53.940
- I don't know.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.334
- What does this look
like to you?

38:56.377 --> 38:58.292
- Oh. My house?
- Yes!

38:58.336 --> 39:01.295
Yay!

39:01.339 --> 39:03.384
<i>- That's so--it's beautiful.</i>

39:03.428 --> 39:05.560
- How does it feel to be here?
- I can't believe I'm here.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.214
I really don't feel
like it's real.

39:07.257 --> 39:08.781
- I can't believe you're here
either to be honest with you.

39:08.824 --> 39:09.912
- Right?

39:09.956 --> 39:11.784
- Well, you know, Kathy,
after making

39:11.827 --> 39:14.830
the occasional appearance
on the show over the years...

39:14.874 --> 39:16.615
- Mm-hmm.
Did you order his boutonniere?

39:16.658 --> 39:18.268
- What's a boutonniere?
- What is a boutonniere?

39:18.312 --> 39:19.792
- You're joking.
- You're joking.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.315
- Is that you're wearing.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.839
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

39:23.883 --> 39:26.407
- Thank God I was doing
my magic act, because--

39:26.451 --> 39:27.713
- You do magic now?

39:27.756 --> 39:29.889
- Well, I did magic earlier.
Where were you?

39:29.932 --> 39:31.456
- Oh, my God.

39:31.499 --> 39:37.244
- Why did you decide to join
this gang now 11 years in?

39:37.287 --> 39:40.639
- I pushed her.
- I--yeah.

39:40.682 --> 39:43.555
- Kyle, Grace from Roswell,
Georgia, wonders,

39:43.598 --> 39:45.644
"How exactly did you
break your nose?

39:45.687 --> 39:47.428
"Are you sure
it wasn't an excuse

39:47.472 --> 39:49.387
to get another nose job?"

39:49.430 --> 39:50.823
- No, it was not an excuse,
but I was happy

39:50.866 --> 39:54.435
that it was broken,
so I could get it done again.

39:54.479 --> 39:55.654
- Were you unhappy
with it before?

39:55.697 --> 39:56.959
- Yeah, I wasn't thrilled.

39:57.003 --> 39:59.745
But I actually did break
it shooting "Halloween."

39:59.788 --> 40:02.356
So I thought, okay, well, fine,
I'll fix the bone that's broken

40:02.400 --> 40:03.923
and make it a little cuter
while I'm at it.

40:03.966 --> 40:06.447
- So I heard you had
an interesting encounter

40:06.491 --> 40:09.450
on your way
to the show this morning.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.017
- Yeah, you could
say that again.

40:11.060 --> 40:15.325
Car is here.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.980
I love you guys.

40:26.293 --> 40:27.903
Ahh!

40:27.947 --> 40:29.905
<i>♪</i>

40:29.949 --> 40:35.694
- Kathy, did you do that?
- Did you--did you do that?

40:35.737 --> 40:37.478
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.611
- No! That's good!

40:39.654 --> 40:40.829
- Speaking
of "Halloween Kills,"

40:40.873 --> 40:43.702
what was it like
stepping back into a role

40:43.745 --> 40:45.530
that you first played
40 years ago?

40:45.573 --> 40:46.835
- It was even more than that.

40:46.879 --> 40:50.491
But it's been unbelievable
reprising this role

40:50.535 --> 40:52.450
all these years later,

40:52.493 --> 40:54.582
<i>working with
Jamie Lee Curtis again.</i>

40:54.626 --> 40:57.498
And just, it's been amazing
just to be part of this film

40:57.542 --> 40:58.891
that's such
a, you know, cult film.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.806
- It means so much
to so many people.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.504
- So much.
I mean, the "Halloween" fans

41:03.548 --> 41:05.898
are like nothing
I have ever seen.

41:05.941 --> 41:07.856
It's gonna be great,
and it comes out October 15th.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.423
- Wow.
- Yay!

41:09.467 --> 41:11.294
- It's going to be in theaters,
so you guys can go see it

41:11.338 --> 41:14.776
and see what happens
and see how I broke my nose.

41:14.820 --> 41:16.386
- It gets bigger
every year anyway.

41:16.430 --> 41:17.779
- Exactly.
Kathy likes to tell me

41:17.823 --> 41:19.302
all the time, "You know,
your ears and your nose

41:19.346 --> 41:20.608
are gonna grow until you die."

41:20.652 --> 41:21.653
I'm like, thanks
for the reminder.

41:24.351 --> 41:26.875
- Okay, switching gears
to something serious.

41:26.919 --> 41:29.835
Erika, I have a lot of
questions about your marriage.

41:29.878 --> 41:31.097
I remember when
your book came out.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.620
- Yeah.

41:32.664 --> 41:33.752
- And I said to you, "What
does Tom think of the book?"

41:33.795 --> 41:34.840
- And I said he hadn't read it.

41:34.883 --> 41:36.406
- And you said
he hasn't read it.

41:36.450 --> 41:37.625
- That's right.

41:37.669 --> 41:39.540
- And I thought that was
so weird.

41:39.584 --> 41:43.849
And I asked you about it,
and you were so defensive.

41:43.892 --> 41:45.546
What does Tom think?

41:45.590 --> 41:47.417
- He hasn't read it either.
No one's read it.

41:47.461 --> 41:48.941
No one's read it in my family.

41:48.984 --> 41:51.944
- I think that's weird.
- Yeah. What's weird about it?

41:51.987 --> 41:54.468
- I mean, you speak about him
so much in the book.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.383
- Yeah, and I speak
about him very kindly.

41:56.426 --> 41:57.950
I mean, he sounds great.

41:57.993 --> 41:59.952
Look, Kyle's gonna
defend Mauricio.

41:59.995 --> 42:01.562
She's gonna defend Rick.

42:01.606 --> 42:04.478
You know what I'm saying?
This is what we do as women.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.088
- And then last year

42:06.132 --> 42:08.830
when you said he hadn't come
to Chicago, I was blown away.

42:08.874 --> 42:10.745
- That was big. Yeah.
- So was I.

42:10.789 --> 42:13.139
- What did Tom think, Erika?

42:13.182 --> 42:14.967
- Well, you know, Tom wasn't
able to come to the show.

42:15.010 --> 42:17.709
We were waiting until
the--yeah, Tom did not make it.

42:17.752 --> 42:20.842
He was gonna come the last
week, and COVID happened.

42:20.886 --> 42:24.324
So he never saw the show.

42:24.367 --> 42:25.847
I'm not giving him
a pass for that,

42:25.891 --> 42:27.980
because I know
that he was in D.C.

42:28.023 --> 42:31.505
and never bothered to come
to New York City.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.420
And I found that out later.

42:33.463 --> 42:36.815
- Why not leave him sooner
if he was cheating on you?

42:36.858 --> 42:41.733
- The cheating is a part of it.
There's so much more there.

42:41.776 --> 42:44.126
And I've said to Tom,
"If you are in love

42:44.170 --> 42:48.478
with someone else,
divorce me and go be with her."

42:48.522 --> 42:50.872
- He said?

42:50.916 --> 42:52.744
- Nothing.
- Zero.

42:52.787 --> 42:54.528
- Were you faithful to him?

42:57.575 --> 43:00.795
<i>♪</i>

43:00.839 --> 43:04.190
<i>Next week,
the reunion continues.</i>

43:04.233 --> 43:05.931
You brought me sauce?
Are you kidding me?

43:05.974 --> 43:07.149
- This is Harry Hamlin's sauce

43:07.193 --> 43:09.630
that he made
before he went to Canada.

43:09.674 --> 43:12.851
- Make sure when you eat it
you send a text the next day.

43:12.894 --> 43:14.853
- I was about to say.
-

43:14.896 --> 43:16.550
- Snuggle me,

43:17.943 --> 43:19.466
- She had sent a picture
of her tits.

43:19.509 --> 43:21.555
And he has a flip phone,
you know, so I responded,

43:21.599 --> 43:24.427
"Nice tits, stupid bitch."

43:24.471 --> 43:25.951
- You pretended
to be my friend.

43:25.994 --> 43:27.735
And you know what that is?
Lying.

43:27.779 --> 43:30.564
- No, that's actually
just playing your ass.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.783
I loved my husband.

43:31.826 --> 43:33.741
Now he's allegedly
defrauding widows,

43:33.785 --> 43:35.090
orphans, and burn victims.

43:35.134 --> 43:37.484
How the
do you think I feel?

43:37.527 --> 43:40.139
- Why are you not saying it
to the victims?

43:40.182 --> 43:42.532
- Why would you leave with me

43:42.576 --> 43:47.494
millions of dollars in lawsuits
pointed at me?

43:47.537 --> 43:49.670
- It's not doing any favors
with the Instagram.

43:49.714 --> 43:51.672
- It's feeding the fire.

43:51.716 --> 43:54.806
- It became
almost preposterous.

43:54.849 --> 43:57.896
- Did any of you hear that Tom
was having money problems?

43:57.939 --> 43:59.680
- Andy knows as much as I do.

43:59.724 --> 44:02.596
- It's only in Beverly Hills
that everybody's so precious.
