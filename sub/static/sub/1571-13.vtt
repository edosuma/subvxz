All right, who's ready
for a little tailgating?

00:40.841 --> 00:43.208
Hey, Brian,
toss me a cold one!

00:44.310 --> 00:46.879
Ah. Nothing better
than a 7:00 a.m. beer

00:46.881 --> 00:48.347
in an unbrushed mouth.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.349
Peter, I don't want
you drinking too much.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.650
You're driving
us all home.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.852
Lois, I know
how many beers I can drink

00:53.854 --> 00:55.320
and still be able to drive.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.388
I figured it out.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.390
(tires screeching)

00:58.858 --> 00:59.591
(screams)

00:59.593 --> 01:00.559
(tires screeching)

01:00.561 --> 01:01.794
(horn blaring)

01:05.398 --> 01:07.800
Seven.

01:08.601 --> 01:10.469
Six.

01:13.106 --> 01:16.275
Hey, Cleveland,
what are you doing back in town?

01:16.277 --> 01:18.444
Just back up here
for my monthly haircut.

01:18.446 --> 01:21.613
When a black man finds
a barber, it's for life.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.349
Oh, my God, there's the CEO
of my company!

01:24.351 --> 01:25.918
Now's my chance
to impress him.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.386
Hey, Mr. Carlisle!

01:27.388 --> 01:28.954
Check this out.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.322
(squawks)

01:31.291 --> 01:32.925
That's what I can do
for the company.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.460
Really?

01:34.462 --> 01:36.762
Can you do <i>other</i>
<i>things for the company?</i>

01:36.764 --> 01:39.298
No! No! No! I don't want
to be promoted that way!

01:39.300 --> 01:40.466
I want to be promoted

01:40.468 --> 01:42.501
the shooting-hawks
with-a-crossbow way.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.771
"The NFL Experience."

01:45.773 --> 01:47.106
That sounds cool.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.540
Kid, you're the best.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.275
Sign with me, and you're
gonna make millions.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.543
Griffin, get out there!

01:51.545 --> 01:52.878
Ow!
It's his knee.

01:52.880 --> 01:53.979
Doc?!

01:53.981 --> 01:55.280
You'll never
play football again.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.482
Too bad, kid.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.317
You was gonna
buy me a house!

01:58.319 --> 01:59.952
Now I have headaches.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.354
I'm gonna save my brain
for science.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.257
Come on, guys.
It's game time.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.959
Yeah!
Patriots!

02:06.961 --> 02:09.495
All right! This is the greatest
Sunday tradition ever.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.063
Except for getting
all my cutaway gags

02:11.065 --> 02:12.731
ready for the week.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.968
Okay, my Great-Uncle-wears
a-ski-hat-all-the-time Griffin

02:15.970 --> 02:18.003
will be followed
by Nick Nolte's handkerchief,

02:18.005 --> 02:20.305
followed by Japanese Abe
Lincoln, and then monkey rabbi.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.741
Hey, where's the monkey rabbi?

02:22.743 --> 02:24.943
Here's your Torah.
You be here on Tuesday at 9:00.

02:24.945 --> 02:25.978
Check in with Shirley.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.412
You gonna need me
this week?

02:27.414 --> 02:28.780
Ah, maybe.
Maybe, Friday.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.349
Uh, now, where are the gays?

02:30.351 --> 02:32.618
Over here.
No, no, no,
the really cartoony gays?

02:32.620 --> 02:34.253
(sing-songy):
Yoo-hoo!

02:34.255 --> 02:36.555
There you are. We're gonna
need you guys all week.

02:42.028 --> 02:43.996
Okay, Brian, so
what are the rules?
What?

02:43.998 --> 02:45.964
Rules? What are the rules?
How do you make points?

02:45.966 --> 02:47.533
Oh, no.
Come on, we're here.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.468
Just give me
the Cliff Notes version.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.370
Like-like who's the guy
with the football ball?

02:51.372 --> 02:52.938
It's just called
a football.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.874
Okay, okay, shorthand lingo.
I like it. I like it.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.943
Now, I see some elements
of Red Rover

02:57.945 --> 02:59.778
with a little bit
of spud mixed in.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.014
And is anyone ever going
to blow a raspberry

03:02.016 --> 03:03.215
on the quarterback's belly?

03:03.217 --> 03:04.550
No, Stewie, that
never happens.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.151
MALE SPORTS ANNOUNCER:
Down goes Brady!

03:06.153 --> 03:08.320
And it looks like
Williams is pulling up his shirt

03:08.322 --> 03:10.189
and having a little fun
with his tummy!

03:10.191 --> 03:11.823
(laughing):
Look! He's doing it!

03:11.825 --> 03:13.659
Aw, this is my favorite part
of the game.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.861
When two drunk guys,
each holding a baby,

03:15.863 --> 03:17.196
get into a fistfight.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.397
You're stupid!

03:18.399 --> 03:20.365
No, you're stupid!

03:20.367 --> 03:22.201
Oh, now their wives
are getting into it.

03:22.203 --> 03:23.468
They're gonna put
their cigarettes

03:23.470 --> 03:24.703
in their mouths
and bump boobs.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.139
You got no class,
you bitch!

03:27.141 --> 03:28.907
No,    <i>y</i>got no class!

03:28.909 --> 03:31.510
And now here comes security
to kick out the wrong person.

03:31.512 --> 03:35.180
(Boston accent):
Come on, Miyagi,
take that karate outside!

03:35.182 --> 03:36.982
(crowd cheering)

03:36.984 --> 03:38.917
ANNOUNCER:
With a five-point lead
and only ten seconds left,

03:38.919 --> 03:41.820
all the Patriots have to do
is kneel down with the ball,

03:41.822 --> 03:44.856
and the game is...
Oh, my God, it's a fumble!

03:44.858 --> 03:46.525
It's picked up by the Bills,

03:46.527 --> 03:48.760
and they're gonna score
the game-winning touchdown!

03:48.762 --> 03:50.028
(crowd booing)

03:50.030 --> 03:51.196
Oh, come on!

03:51.198 --> 03:53.065
My God,
ten losses in a row?!

03:53.067 --> 03:55.167
This whole season's been
one long bad dream.

03:55.169 --> 03:57.536
Yeah, like that one
where I walk into the bank,

03:57.538 --> 03:59.238
and I ain't got
no clothes on.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.240
Sir, what are you doing?
You have no clothes on.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.875
Ah, must be having one
of those dreams again.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.544
Better wake myself up.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.379
Oh, thank God.

04:07.381 --> 04:10.749
Well, time to apply for
this small business loan.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.055
TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to Turner
Classic Movies' presentation

04:17.057 --> 04:21.093
of John Wayne's final Western,
<i>Big Bill Doyle.</i>

04:21.095 --> 04:22.928
♪

04:24.631 --> 04:27.599
Big Bill, two men got off
the 2:40 from Amarillo.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.534
JOHN WAYNE:
Saddle my horse.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.537
John Wayne only ate beef
and coffee for every meal,

04:32.539 --> 04:34.873
so the director had to shoot
around the fact

04:34.875 --> 04:36.908
that he was on the toilet
all the time.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.243
Yee-hoo!
Yee-hoo!

04:38.245 --> 04:40.412
Reach for the sky, pilgrims.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.047
(horse whinnies)

04:42.049 --> 04:43.582
Big Bill Doyle!

04:43.584 --> 04:44.716
That's right.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.586
And I just made
a Big Bill coil.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.987
Damn it,
I'm so angry

04:48.989 --> 04:50.455
the stupid
Pats lost.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.623
And to Buffalo!

04:51.625 --> 04:53.158
Buffalo's got
everything.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.926
They don't need
a win like this.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.828
You know, I am gonna
channel this anger

04:56.830 --> 04:58.230
into something useful.

04:58.232 --> 05:00.399
Like trying to get sand
out of my backpack.

05:02.001 --> 05:03.502
(yelling)

05:03.504 --> 05:06.171
It's been four years
since I went to the beach!

05:06.173 --> 05:07.606
Try turning it
inside out.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.807
Don't you think
I tried that?!

05:08.809 --> 05:10.575
That's the first
thing I did!

05:10.577 --> 05:13.512
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return
to the Fox NFL Post-Game Show.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.147
I'm here with
C.J. Spiller.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.482
C.J., you ran for
200 yards today.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.118
How did you manage that
against the Patriots' defense?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.120
Well, we just gelled
as a team today,

05:22.122 --> 05:24.323
and was fortunate
to come away with the win.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.258
All thanks
and praise goes to God.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.126
He really won
this one for us.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.429
Mario Williams, you scored
the winning touchdown.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.364
How does it feel
to beat the Patriots?

05:32.366 --> 05:35.100
I'd like to thank God
and a jury of my peers,

05:35.102 --> 05:37.969
who are both responsible for
me being able to play today.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.938
What the hell?!
This is such bull crap!

05:39.940 --> 05:42.040
Well, what are you
talking about?
Isn't it obvious?

05:42.042 --> 05:43.041
God hates the Patriots.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.309
He made 'em lose again!

05:44.311 --> 05:45.677
Peter, uncross your legs.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.512
It's weird to yell
with your legs crossed.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.781
Come on, don't you notice that
whenever the Patriots lose,

05:49.783 --> 05:51.350
the other team
always thanks God?

05:51.352 --> 05:53.352
Huh. Peter
does kind of
have a point.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.520
Guys, I'm tired of God
messing with football.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.489
We got to do something
about it!

05:57.491 --> 05:58.690
Like what?

05:58.692 --> 05:59.958
We got to find God

05:59.960 --> 06:01.360
and tell him
to cut the crap.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.729
How many times
is God gonna ruin our Sunday

06:03.731 --> 06:05.530
with both church
and bad football?

06:05.532 --> 06:07.966
It's time someone told God
to stay where He belongs--

06:07.968 --> 06:09.668
in our schools,

06:09.670 --> 06:12.204
and-and telling people where
they can stick their wieners.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.338
Now, what do you say?

06:13.340 --> 06:15.040
Let's go find God!

06:15.042 --> 06:16.742
All right, I'm in!
Me, too!

06:16.744 --> 06:18.810
Let's do this!

06:18.812 --> 06:20.645
Whoa, whoa, Joe, Joe!
What the hell?!

06:20.647 --> 06:21.980
What?

06:21.982 --> 06:24.082
I thought, uh, "Find God"
was a code word.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.151
No. We meant literally
go and find him.

06:26.153 --> 06:29.488
Oh. Well, I already
texted Bonnie.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.557
(phone buzzes)

06:37.163 --> 06:39.398
(glass breaking)

06:41.000 --> 06:43.468
(explosion thunders)

06:51.043 --> 06:54.913
Ugh. What a night.

06:56.616 --> 07:00.552
Whew! What... a... night.

07:00.554 --> 07:04.790
Ca... ray... zy.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.759
Uh, yes, telegram
for hungover.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.228
Yes, I'll-I'll sign for that,
thank you very much.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.897
Oh, boy.
(sighs)

07:11.899 --> 07:13.432
How was your
night, Stewie?

07:13.434 --> 07:15.467
Ugh! Get your own life, bro.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.068
Get off my sack.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.571
Well, Lois, the guys and
I are off to find God.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.972
Peter, that's ridiculous.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.407
This is ridiculous?

07:22.409 --> 07:25.110
There's 500 old grocery
bags neatly folded

07:25.112 --> 07:26.945
and crammed into
one of our cabinets.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.613
I'm leaving those
for the kids.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.415
Peter, the idea of God,
let alone

07:30.417 --> 07:32.484
that he'd care anything
about football, is absurd.

07:32.486 --> 07:35.554
Well, it's absurd to think that
my hand scratching on the couch

07:35.556 --> 07:37.856
is some kind of animal,
but you do.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.203
What the (bleep) is that?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.741
Okay, this is God's house,
so we'll just go in there,

07:56.743 --> 07:59.077
talk to Him, and take care
of this whole thing.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.313
It'll be easy as one, two...

08:09.689 --> 08:11.723
(no voice)

08:23.970 --> 08:26.671
(British accent):
Three.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.473
Hang on, guys.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.642

"First Headline Read Aloud

09:06.580 --> 09:08.346
No, no, not that one,
the one below it.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.849
Oh. "Carrie Underwood

09:12.920 --> 09:14.986

where we can find Him?

09:14.988 --> 09:16.488
I'm sure she does.

09:16.490 --> 09:19.357
She's smart.
She won her job in a contest.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.826
Guys, we are going to Nashville.

09:29.335 --> 09:30.936
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>That wasn't our line.</i>

09:30.938 --> 09:33.238
<i>Here comes our line.</i>

09:40.379 --> 09:42.781
Wow, the Country
Music Awards!

09:42.783 --> 09:45.617
And you know it's huge 'cause
it's on a Tuesday night.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.252
Hey, look, there's
Taylor Swift.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.088
And there's Taylor
Not-So-Swift.

09:50.090 --> 09:54.025
♪ I broke up with
a birthday cake. ♪

09:54.027 --> 09:56.995
Ugh. We went on,
like, two dates.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.631
Hey, you're Carrie Underwood,
right?

09:59.633 --> 10:01.866
I sure am.
You want an autograph?

10:01.868 --> 10:03.802
Yeah, can you get me
Randy Travis's?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.870
Uh, I don't think so.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.906
Hey, in that song,
"Jesus, Take the Wheel,"

10:07.908 --> 10:11.476
was that, like, the real Jesus,
or was it just some Mexican guy?

10:11.478 --> 10:13.545
No, it was the
real Jesus.

10:13.547 --> 10:14.913
Wow. So, you know Him?

10:14.915 --> 10:16.381
We're actually looking
for His father.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.083
Do you know
where we can find God?

10:18.085 --> 10:19.951
Well, God is
everywhere.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.988
He's in our hearts, and we take
Him with us wherever we go.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.589
Yeah, we're looking for,
like, an address.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.558
Look, you guys,
I don't know who you are,

10:26.560 --> 10:28.126
but I have
to go perform.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.261
Peter, I don't think
she knows where God is.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.830
Let's go.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.800
Hey, you know I don't like
you talking to other guys.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.469
I'm sorry, Jesus.
Whatever.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.271
Give me 40 bucks.
I want to get a Toby Keith hat.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.906
You sure you don't want
to stay for the show?

10:41.908 --> 10:43.408
Nah. This place
gives me the creeps.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.477
Like when I went to
that Pedophile Opera.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.913
OPERA ANNOUNCER:
We are proud to present Mozart's
<i>The Magic Flute...</i>

10:48.915 --> 10:51.149
in A minor.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.986
And you still won't give us
an Emmy? Come on!

10:54.988 --> 10:56.621
If   <i>Modern Famil</i>did that joke,

10:56.623 --> 10:59.224
you'd be carrying 'em around
on your shoulders!

11:03.095 --> 11:05.430
Well, God wasn't in
Nashville either.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.766
Maybe it's time to
throw in the towel.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.801
All right, look, maybe I'm
not like other football fans,

11:09.803 --> 11:12.671
but I don't have a fulfilling
career and a rich family life.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.873
Football is all I got.
Peter's right.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.342
We all live and die
with the Patriots.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.010
Yeah, we got to do this.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.046
Even if it means travelling
to the ends of the Earth.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.048
That's the spirit, guys.
We'll find him.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.650
It can't be any harder
than finding that cheese.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.352
I think the cheese
is that way.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.020
I'm pretty sure
it's over here.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.290
Guys, guys, finding the cheese
is what they want us to do.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.392
Let's just chill.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.861
I don't know where they're
getting all this weed.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.130
♪

11:43.869 --> 11:46.838
"In Greece, it was commonly held
that one could speak to the gods

11:46.840 --> 11:48.540
from the top
of Mount Olympus."

11:48.542 --> 11:50.008
We should probably
go there.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.876
What do you mean "gods"?
There's more than one?

11:51.878 --> 11:53.878
Yes, Peter.
Greece is polytheistic.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.680
PETER:

Words.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.552
Yeah, you get it.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.692
Apparently, the Greeks have
a bunch of different gods.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.260
Athena's the goddess
of wisdom.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.162
Poseidon is the god
of the sea.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.364
And I am Chronos,
the god of time.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.766
Oh, cool,
what do you do?

12:14.768 --> 12:17.102
I tell the time and
make gift baskets.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.537
So are you also
the god of gift baskets?

12:19.539 --> 12:22.307
I don't know;
you tell me.

Rosewood-mango candle?!

Chronos!

by the way.

12:32.351 --> 12:33.618
(tires screech)

12:35.187 --> 12:37.355
All right, what better place
to find God than the birthplace

12:37.357 --> 12:39.891
of all of Western
civilization's great religions

12:39.893 --> 12:41.459
and one really mean one.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.795
I had a feeling this is
what this place would be like.

Oh, God, it's so hot out.
Why is there never
any parking downtown?

12:46.032 --> 12:48.299
Who gets married on a Tuesday?
I got to get off
these bad feet.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.701
Ailments!

12:49.703 --> 12:52.003
Oh, look, Joe's
feeding 'em pennies.

12:54.140 --> 12:57.542
Oh, oh!
Somebody take a picture.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.245
I can't believe we didn't
find God in Jerusalem.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.713
Well, we'll have
to keep looking.

13:01.715 --> 13:03.515
Oh, here's our bus
to the airport.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.386
(coughing):
Wow.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.523

That was super loud.

country in the world.

engines rumbling)

13:26.138 --> 13:29.307
God is not here.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.479
Well, that whole
trip was pointless.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.815
Yeah, plus I left
my Jacuzzi on the whole time,

13:36.817 --> 13:38.750
came home
to a boiled raccoon.

13:38.752 --> 13:40.485
You guys, I feel terrible.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.087
I'm sorry I dragged you around
the world looking for God.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.290
I guess it was
a huge waste of time.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.625
Like bringin' a married guy
to Vegas.

13:47.627 --> 13:51.129
So I'm thinking steak house.
Do they have salad?
I can't eat red meat.

13:51.131 --> 13:54.933
Yeah. Then we hit the tables.
I'm already down
30 bucks.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.101
Maybe the sportsbook.
Is that near Caesars?

13:57.103 --> 13:59.304
I got to get Brandy
a Celine Dion T-shirt.

13:59.306 --> 14:02.540
And then the strip club.
Guys, we have
a 7:00 a.m. tee time.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.976
And are we just gonna bail
on the Hoover Dam?

14:04.978 --> 14:06.444
Hey, guys.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.446
Hey, Death.
What are you doing here?

14:08.448 --> 14:10.515
Actually, I'm here
for your show.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.984
Oh, come on, man.
I'm on vacation.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.886
Wait a minute, Death,
you work with God!

14:14.888 --> 14:16.221
Will you take us to Him?

14:16.223 --> 14:17.488
Sure, I guess
I could.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.491
But don't
you mean "her"?

14:20.493 --> 14:22.560
(laughs)
Look at your faces!

14:22.562 --> 14:24.929
Of course it's a dude.
Come on, let's go.

14:31.503 --> 14:34.172
Aw, Death, we really appreciate
you taking us to see God.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.406
No problem.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.875
I was supposed
to kill Russell Brand,

14:36.877 --> 14:38.843
but I'll just
do this instead.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.345
Oh, w-well, wait, wait now.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.747
I mean, you could just
pick us up after...

14:47.152 --> 14:49.087
What the...
Where the hell are we?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.222
This is Heaven.
This is Heaven?!

14:51.224 --> 14:52.757
It looks
like a Sandals.

14:52.759 --> 14:55.260
Oh, hey, I'm God.
Welcome to Heaven.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.228
Oh, you got
to be kidding me!

14:57.230 --> 14:59.163
Handicapped is still
a thing up here?

14:59.165 --> 15:00.832
Oh, yeah, you're
like this forever.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.867
Hey, how come everyone
has different kinds of towels?

15:02.869 --> 15:05.236
Well, we don't provide towels;
you have to bring your own.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.405
It's very important
that you die holding towels.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.840
Have the priests
not been passing this along?

15:08.842 --> 15:10.608
It's very important.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.911
You know, I actually can't
believe they let me into Heaven.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.947
They won't even let me umpire
little league games anymore.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.916
Strike two!

15:17.918 --> 15:20.551
And, Ricky, you have got
the best ass on this field.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.288
Look, God, the reason we're
here is we wanted to tell you

15:23.290 --> 15:25.223
to stop messing
with the Patriots!

15:25.225 --> 15:26.925
(laughs)
What?!

15:26.927 --> 15:28.793
You really think I'd get
involved with football games

15:28.795 --> 15:31.062
when there's people dying
in Africa?

15:31.064 --> 15:33.932
Are you gonna do something about
the people dying in Africa?

15:33.934 --> 15:35.733
No, but I'm pretty upset
about it.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.568
Come off it, God,
you know what you're doing.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.137
Stop making
the Patriots lose!

15:39.139 --> 15:41.072
I'm God. I don't
have to do anything.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.707
Ah, so you admit it!

15:42.709 --> 15:43.875
Maybe.

15:43.877 --> 15:45.310
Oh, my God,
it's true?!

15:45.312 --> 15:46.911
You don't, like, pay attention

15:46.913 --> 15:49.948
to how much each individual tips
at each meal, right?

15:49.950 --> 15:53.451
Look, look, God, why... why
you got to hurt Patriots fans?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.119
These are good, drunk people

15:55.121 --> 15:57.889
who work hard to get
absolutely nowhere in life.

15:57.891 --> 15:59.290
There are three million
fishermen

15:59.292 --> 16:01.492
and only seven fish left
in the sea.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.394
But they live to watch football,

16:03.396 --> 16:06.831
many of them still on Zenith
or Sylvania television sets.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.434
Please, God, we're beggin' ya,

16:09.436 --> 16:10.969
leave football alone.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.437
It's all we got.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.771
(sighs)

16:13.773 --> 16:15.273
Look, it-it's not the fans.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.841
It's just...
It's Belichick.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.576
I don't like him.

16:18.578 --> 16:22.080
I gave that guy three Super
Bowls, and he never smiled once.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.248
Not even at home.
Be grateful!

16:24.250 --> 16:25.950
But... but that's
just Belichick.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.251
Yeah, come on, God.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.687
Um, I'm locked out
of my room again.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.489
Oh, yeah, go directly
to the boss.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.291
Don't even try to ask
an employee.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.259
You got to lock
the doors in Heaven?

16:35.261 --> 16:38.196
One guy lost a laptop,
and everybody went nuts.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.131
All right, all right,
I'll tell you what.

16:40.133 --> 16:43.134
If you make Belichick smile,
I'll let the Patriots win again.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.602
Oh. Okay, you're on.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.437
I don't know, Peter,
that's gonna be tough.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.940
Don't worry, I got a lot of
practice making people smile.

16:48.942 --> 16:51.442
I used to be a celebrity
baby photographer.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.112
Okay, Apple, Apple,
smile for Peter.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.980
Smile for... No? No?

16:55.982 --> 16:57.949
Okay, okay, look over there.
Who's that? Who's that?

16:57.951 --> 17:00.284
Who loves you over there?
That's right.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.986
Can you smile
for Nanny Number Two?

17:01.988 --> 17:04.022
(giggles)
That's it!
There you go.

17:04.024 --> 17:07.225
And your mommy said that
she'll be able to Skype at 8:30

17:07.227 --> 17:09.761
if drinks don't turn
into dinner.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.671
Okay, okay,
shh, here he comes.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.640
Hiya, Mr. Belichick!

17:22.642 --> 17:24.575
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.477
We are here
to make you smile.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.047
And if there's one thing
that always gets me to smile,

17:29.049 --> 17:30.481
it's a child's laughter.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.250
So, I found this kid
in the parking lot,

17:32.252 --> 17:34.419
and I'm gonna make
him laugh for you.

17:37.923 --> 17:39.524
Come on, laugh.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.526
Who's your bubba?
Wudgie, wudgie, wudgie, wudgie.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.261
(monotone):
Don't touch my son's face.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.695
Get over here,
little man.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.831
This flight is cleared
for liftoff.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.066
Vroom. Liftoff.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.367
(monotone):
Whee.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.568
Who's flying?
Whee.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.936
You're flying.
Again.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.171
Who's daddy's
little jet?

17:53.173 --> 17:56.240
I love you,
Daddy.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.413
Oh, God,
you guys again?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.715
All right, Coach,
another surefire equation

18:04.717 --> 18:07.251
for comedy is tragedy plus time.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.087
(yelling)

18:09.089 --> 18:11.422
And now we wait.

18:13.058 --> 18:15.393
All right, Coach, now one
thing that's always funny is

18:15.395 --> 18:17.795
when I dub my voice
over animal footage

18:17.797 --> 18:21.532
and introduce human foibles
into their situations.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.201
PETER'S VOICE:
Tough day at the bank?

18:23.203 --> 18:25.103
PETER'S VOICE (deeper):
No. Just had a bad lunch.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.037
What did you have?

18:26.039 --> 18:28.239
Serengeti and meatballs.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.608
(giggling):
How absurd!

18:30.610 --> 18:33.211
Look, you guys have been
following me around all day

18:33.213 --> 18:34.645
making fools out
of yourselves.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.114
Would you just
leave me alone?

18:36.116 --> 18:37.648
I've got work to do.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.884
Oh, guys,
I guess we failed.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.652
Sorry for wasting
your time, Coach.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.321
We got to get to
the hospital anyway.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.989
Our friend
Joe here has

18:44.991 --> 18:46.924
to have his fluids
changed every 72 hours,

18:46.926 --> 18:49.827
or else he swells up and
his eyes turn yellow.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.229
BELICHICK:
Huh.
What was that?

18:51.231 --> 18:52.396
Oh, my God, Joe, quick!

18:52.398 --> 18:54.499
Tell him more
about your sad life.

18:54.501 --> 18:57.502
Uh, every morning, I wake up
drenched in my own urine.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.905
My feet are just shoes sewn
to the bottom of my pants.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.407
Last week, the handicapped seat
on the bus was taken,

19:03.409 --> 19:05.776
so they put me on the front,
like a bicycle.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.411
After I injured my legs,

19:07.413 --> 19:10.448
my doctor said I'd be walking
again in two weeks.

19:10.450 --> 19:14.152
(monotone):
Huh. That's hysterical.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.319
Oh, my God, yes!

19:15.321 --> 19:16.754
All right! All right!
He smiled!

19:16.756 --> 19:18.156
We did it!

19:18.158 --> 19:19.957
Aw, man, this is
my biggest accomplishment

19:19.959 --> 19:23.728
since my 1920s solo flight
across the Atlantic.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.598
(crowd cheers and applauds)

19:29.134 --> 19:30.268
<i>Vive</i> Pierre Griffin!

19:30.270 --> 19:31.202
<i>Incroyable!</i>

19:31.204 --> 19:32.637
Don't look in there.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.438
Don't look in there.
It's all craps.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.374
All right, we got to put toilets
in these things

19:36.376 --> 19:38.910
if we're gonna be in 'em
for more than two hours.

19:41.613 --> 19:43.848
Wow. You guys
pulled it off.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.116
Well, a deal's a deal.

19:45.118 --> 19:47.151
I'll leave the
Patriots alone.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.219
Oh, thanks, God!

19:48.221 --> 19:50.188
Yeah!
Really appreciate it.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.722
Aw, come here, you!
(laughs)

19:51.724 --> 19:53.291
Ah, ah, ah!
Get off me!

19:53.293 --> 19:55.026
Get off me!
What the hell?

19:55.028 --> 19:57.295
God's mildly
autistic.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.330
You can't touch Him,
especially on the head.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.232
It's all right,
it's all right,
it's all right.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.034
Just-Just-Just
don't do that!

20:03.036 --> 20:04.335
Sorry about that.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.403
Well, uh, again, thanks.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.537
We won't forget this.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.206
Oh, by the way...

20:08.208 --> 20:10.341
Conway Twitty
says cut it out.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.877
Just write a joke.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.250
Well, Peter,
I'm glad you're home,

20:19.252 --> 20:21.586
and I'm happy you guys found
what you were looking for.

20:21.588 --> 20:24.555
Yeah, and this trip made me
realize that 98% of the world

20:24.557 --> 20:26.557
is just making
each other blankets.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.192
So, Brian, you still
an atheist

20:28.194 --> 20:29.393
now that Dad's
met God?

20:29.395 --> 20:30.761
Stewie, who knows
who he met?

20:30.763 --> 20:32.530
Every time we go
to Disney World,

20:32.532 --> 20:34.932
he thinks Mickey Mouse just
happened to be there that day.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.401
I'll tell ya, seeing God in
Heaven was just like that time

20:37.403 --> 20:39.170
I met Mickey and Donald
outside Thunder Mountain.

20:39.172 --> 20:40.571
I mean, what are the odds?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.240
But, Peter, I still
don't understand why

20:42.242 --> 20:44.041
you would go
to all that trouble

20:44.043 --> 20:46.344
to find God and only ask
about the Patriots.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.179
Oh, I asked
for one more thing.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.381
Aah! What's happening?!

20:50.383 --> 20:51.749
Don't look at her.
Don't look at her.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.050
It's okay.
Just go with it.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.652
It'll all be over
in a second.
