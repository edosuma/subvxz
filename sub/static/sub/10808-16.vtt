00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:21.715 --> 01:25.708
(radio broadcast
playing indistinctly)

01:30.190 --> 01:32.590
(phone ringing)

01:41.068 --> 01:43.366
(phone continues ringing)

01:45.072 --> 01:46.674
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
More of the same tomorrow,

01:46.674 --> 01:48.609
with a high of only 60.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.511
And now, here are
today's top stories.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.780
Chasbury police are looking
for the man or animal

01:52.780 --> 01:55.516
whose savage attack has left
a man in critical condition

01:55.516 --> 01:57.084
-(ringing continues)
-at Mercy Hospital.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.986
The spokesman for
the sheriff's office says

01:58.986 --> 02:01.121
the attack may be linked
to the bizarre slaying

02:01.121 --> 02:03.490
of a dog in an area home,
late last night.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.427
Chief of Police Merle Johnson
is asking local residents

02:06.427 --> 02:09.263
to report any sightings
of wild animals or dog packs

02:09.263 --> 02:12.755
to his office immediately,
and to keep children inside.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.432
(ringing continues)

02:18.806 --> 02:20.574
(sighs)

02:20.574 --> 02:22.565
(ringing continues)

02:27.314 --> 02:28.542
Hello?

02:30.551 --> 02:34.221
(whispering): Janice,
how did you get this number?

02:34.221 --> 02:36.957
No, you cannot talk to Bobby.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.559
You're gonna have to believe

02:38.559 --> 02:41.095
that I'm acting
in our boy's best interests.

02:41.095 --> 02:42.563
I cannot be more specific!

02:42.563 --> 02:44.131
There's a problem.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.866
A terrible problem.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.901
But I'm gonna take care of it.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.938
Nobody's gonna get hurt,
I'm gonna see to that.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.373
I know what has to be done.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.375
No. l...

02:55.375 --> 02:58.245
Of course I'd never harm him.

02:58.245 --> 03:00.080
I'm not crazy.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.983
lwished l were.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.085
0h, never mind.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.187
I'm
s

03:07.187 --> 03:09.757
I'm exhausted.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.059
Look, I got to hang up now.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.495
We're gonna be
leaving here soon.

03:14.495 --> 03:17.030
No, I will not tell you
where we're going.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.967
You've got to stop
following us.

03:19.967 --> 03:23.704
Janice... we...

03:23.704 --> 03:26.874
we're not a family anymore.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.175
Good-bye.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.166
(hangs up)

03:31.211 --> 03:33.147
(footsteps approaching)

03:33.147 --> 03:35.082
-(door creaks)
-Son?

03:35.082 --> 03:36.517
That was your mother.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.919
That means we're gonna
have to be leaving here

03:38.919 --> 03:40.352
as soon as you can.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.858
Trust me, I know what's best.

03:44.858 --> 03:49.897
It wouldn't even be safe...
for Mom to come.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.433
We don't want anything
to happen to her.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.424
Right?

03:58.605 --> 04:02.609
One of these days,
we're gonna find a cure for you,

04:02.609 --> 04:06.443
and then everything will be
just like it used to be.

04:14.521 --> 04:17.354
(crow cawing in distance)

04:26.066 --> 04:28.557
(sofa creaking)

04:41.548 --> 04:43.539
(bird hooting)

04:45.519 --> 04:49.156
(softly): Dad?

04:49.156 --> 04:50.714
Dad?

04:57.431 --> 05:00.367
(bird trilling quietly)

05:00.367 --> 05:02.426
(panting softly)

05:16.149 --> 05:18.447
(raspy snarling)

05:20.454 --> 05:22.854
(snarling)

05:26.226 --> 05:29.129
(growling)

05:29.129 --> 05:31.461
(growling, snarling)

05:37.104 --> 05:39.629
(deep, vicious growling)

05:41.575 --> 05:44.244
(deep, echoing howl)

05:44.244 --> 05:46.007
(deep snarl)

05:47.581 --> 05:49.216
(deep snarling)

05:49.216 --> 05:51.207
(low growling, snarling)

05:53.887 --> 05:56.757
(deep growling)

05:56.757 --> 05:58.292
(fierce snarl)

05:58.292 --> 06:01.695
(low growling)

06:01.695 --> 06:03.397
(bolting door)

06:03.397 --> 06:05.888
(muffled growling)

06:10.370 --> 06:12.361
(howling)

06:19.813 --> 06:21.682
WOMAN: Now, let's see,
you're Mrs. Perry?

06:21.682 --> 06:23.951
Please, call me Janice.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.384
Fine. Janice.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.980
Now, how can I help you?

06:31.925 --> 06:34.962
(exhales)

06:34.962 --> 06:37.531
My husband has kidnapped
our son.

06:37.531 --> 06:41.068
It happened about
six months ago.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.804
We were on vacation
in Ireland.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.807
There was a hunting accident.

06:46.807 --> 06:51.878
Both my son and I
ended up in the hospital.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.815
Bobby was very badly hurt.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.917
(sobs)
It was terrible.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.919
But he's all right now?

06:58.919 --> 07:00.147
Oh, yeah.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.557
I had a head injury.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.026
When I came out of it,
the doctors told me that Robert

07:06.026 --> 07:08.495
had just taken Bobby late
one night and run off with him.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.630
No explanation? Nothing?

07:10.630 --> 07:11.832
(exhales)

07:11.832 --> 07:13.567
A letter.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.635
Wild and very vague.

07:15.635 --> 07:18.605
Something about Bobby
had some kind of problem

07:18.605 --> 07:21.308
and I had to trust him.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.144
lthink he's
out of his mind.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.146
He just left his job.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.448
Didn't give any notice,
didn't call anybody.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.117
He's literally been on the run

07:30.117 --> 07:32.052
with Bobby
since they left Ireland.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.221
He's dragging that boy
all over the country.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.857
I'm afraid Bobby hasn't had
a decent meal in six months,

07:36.857 --> 07:38.692
let alone been in school.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.127
You've got to help us.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.962
Why don't you go to the police?

07:41.962 --> 07:44.453
No. Not the police.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.368
I don't want to cause
any serious problems

07:48.368 --> 07:50.470
for my husband.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.672
| just want my son back.

07:52.672 --> 07:56.243
(sighs)
I know where he is.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.378
I found the house
that they've rented.

07:58.378 --> 08:01.248
Maybe if you would go to him...

08:01.248 --> 08:03.483
tell him he can't
do this anymore,

08:03.483 --> 08:05.886
that-that what he's doing
is against the law

08:05.886 --> 08:09.056
and he must give Bobby up,
he might do it.

08:09.056 --> 08:12.826
I don't think this is something
I can help you with.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.961
I am reporting
a clear-cut case

08:14.961 --> 08:16.696
of negligence, if not abuse.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.999
This is the Child Service
Department, isn't it?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.735
What else do you do here?!

08:21.735 --> 08:23.170
You're absolutely sure

08:23.170 --> 08:25.338
that your husband
has been abusing your son?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.507
(quietly):
Yes.

08:27.507 --> 08:31.044
I've spoken to Robert
a few times on the phone.

08:31.044 --> 08:35.015
He's got this idea that there's
something wrong with Bobby

08:35.015 --> 08:37.551
and he has to lock him up!

08:37.551 --> 08:40.821
It's insane!

08:40.821 --> 08:43.813
I'm afraid he's gonna hurt him.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.930
You see...

08:49.930 --> 08:53.867
my son and l
have always been very close.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.358
I think Robert
is jealous of that.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.841
All right.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.944
We won't make this official.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.146
We'll just pay your husband
an informal visit,

09:06.146 --> 09:08.315
see if we can
make him see reason.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.517
(quietly):
Thank you.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.883
(sniffles) I'm sure
you're doing the right thing.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.188
A mother should never
be separated from her child.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.861
(bird trilling)

09:20.861 --> 09:23.853
(low, deep heartbeat)

09:25.132 --> 09:27.225
(deep growling)

09:29.236 --> 09:31.761
-(heartbeat continues)
-(chains rattle)

09:34.508 --> 09:36.510
(latch echoing)

09:36.510 --> 09:38.478
(heartbeat continues)

09:39.513 --> 09:41.378
(raspy, hollow breathing)

09:43.383 --> 09:44.885
(deep voice):
Bobby...

09:44.885 --> 09:48.021
ROBERT:
Bobby? Wake up, son.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.512
-(birds chirping)
-Oh, Dad.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.762
What time is it?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.764
It's almost 3:00.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.800
You nearly slept
the whole day away.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.132
I brought you some food.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.951
Do you feel okay today?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.350
Feel great!

10:21.555 --> 10:23.156
(birds chirping)

10:23.156 --> 10:26.092
I'd like to get out of here
for a while.

10:26.092 --> 10:29.396
lfeel like taking a nice,
long run in the country.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.031
No.

10:31.031 --> 10:35.402
We can't take a chance
on your being seen by anyone.

10:35.402 --> 10:38.438
Besides, it's gonna
get dark real soon.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.962
Okay.

10:41.575 --> 10:44.311
Bobby, you know that
bad feeling you get

10:44.311 --> 10:46.079
when it happens.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.215
That's gone now, right?

10:48.215 --> 10:50.217
You feel like yourself again?

10:50.217 --> 10:52.686
I guess so.
I don't know.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.755
I've been feeling a little...
different lately.

10:55.755 --> 10:57.324
How?

10:57.324 --> 11:00.460
Well, always before
when it happened,

11:00.460 --> 11:03.430
I didn't want it to,
but I couldn't stop it.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.132
Even when l was right
in the middle of it,

11:06.132 --> 11:07.968
I wanted it to stop.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.437
I remember looking down
at my hands,

11:10.437 --> 11:12.906
and them looking
like an animal's.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.975
l was really scared.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.878
But the past couple of times,
it's been different.

11:18.878 --> 11:22.115
It still hurts
when it first happens,

11:22.115 --> 11:24.351
but after the pain goes away,

11:24.351 --> 11:26.453
and I start changing,

11:26.453 --> 11:29.522
lfeel like I want it to happen,
and that l rea...

11:29.522 --> 11:31.024
No, you don't.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.526
You're just not
remembering right.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.961
Yes, I am.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.030
lfeel wild and crazy

11:37.030 --> 11:40.834
and really strong,
like I could do anything.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.336
Bobby...

11:43.336 --> 11:45.702
do you remember anything
about last night?

11:47.607 --> 11:50.677
(car drives up)

11:50.677 --> 11:52.979
-(car doors open, shut)
-No matter what happens,

11:52.979 --> 11:55.315
I want you to promise me
you'll stay in this room;

11:55.315 --> 11:56.549
you won't come out that door.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.351
-Dad!
-Promise me.

11:58.351 --> 12:01.154
(footsteps approaching)

12:01.154 --> 12:03.213
Promise.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.964
(door opens)

12:10.964 --> 12:12.955
(door shuts)

12:16.002 --> 12:17.871
WOMAN:
Why all the bolts and bar?

12:17.871 --> 12:19.339
(Robert sighs)

12:19.339 --> 12:21.508
What's behind that door,
Mr. Perry?

12:21.508 --> 12:23.910
He's got my boy in there.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.312
Just go away.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.715
Just open the door
and let us take a look.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.518
We'll be happy to leave
when we see what's inside.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.154
I'm not a child, miss.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.022
Or an incompetent.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.757
We both know who's in there.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.959
My son is in there!

12:39.959 --> 12:42.228
And that's where
he's gonna stay.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.798
Why are you doing this, Robert?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.333
What's happened to you?

12:46.333 --> 12:47.500
ROBERT:
It's not me.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.702
Don't you understand?

12:48.702 --> 12:50.770
It's Bobby.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.872
Bobby's changed,

12:52.872 --> 12:55.466
and I'm the only one
who can help him.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.569
You shouldn't have brought
an outsider into this.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.085
Mr. Perry, your wife
is very worried about her son.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.887
Surely you can understand that.

13:07.887 --> 13:11.658
She hasn't seen him
for six months. Please!

13:11.658 --> 13:14.928
Just let us take a look,
see that he's okay.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.954
Then we'll leave.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.746
No.

13:32.746 --> 13:36.216
Get away from that door!

13:36.216 --> 13:38.707
-Mom!
-Oh, Bobby!

13:40.553 --> 13:43.390
Get out of here.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.654
Right now!

13:46.760 --> 13:48.785
No! Dad, what are you doing?

13:49.729 --> 13:52.232
They can't stay here.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.700
Come on, Janice.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.702
We're leaving, Mr. Perry.

13:55.702 --> 13:56.936
Janice, let's go.

13:56.936 --> 13:59.200
Let's go, Janice.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.243
You are not gonna get away
with this!

14:03.243 --> 14:04.944
He's my son, too!

14:04.944 --> 14:06.146
You're crazy.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.480
You're a maniac!

14:07.480 --> 14:10.040
They're gonna lock you up!

14:11.351 --> 14:13.553
I'll be back for you, Bobby.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.222
You know that.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.019
(whispers):
I'll be back.

14:29.068 --> 14:30.236
ROBERT:
Bobby?

14:30.236 --> 14:31.704
What?

14:31.704 --> 14:34.808
Think I'm gonna buy a couple
tickets to Miami this time.

14:34.808 --> 14:37.110
Be a nice change
from all this cold weather.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.278
What do you think?

14:38.278 --> 14:39.646
Fine.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.615
Buy two tickets
to the Moon, if you like.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.452
Son, I can understand
you being angry.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.353
BOBBY:
You pulled a gun on Mom!

14:47.353 --> 14:50.523
I had to. To protect her.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.760
BOBBY: That's what you keep
saying, and I'm sick of it!

14:53.760 --> 14:56.429
I'd never hurt Mom!

14:56.429 --> 14:59.299
What's that for?
What are you doing?

14:59.299 --> 15:02.168
Let go of my arm, son.

15:02.168 --> 15:05.604
You're keeping me here like
some type of animal in the zoo.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.577
You got out of here again
last night.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.378
Good.

15:12.378 --> 15:14.814
You don't know what you're like
when it happens.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.544
Yes, I do, and I love it.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.888
You little idiot...

15:21.888 --> 15:23.890
you killed a man last night.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.881
What?

15:28.828 --> 15:31.058
It's not your fault.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.169
Wow.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.671
Guess I am kind of dangerous.

15:38.671 --> 15:42.275
Yeah, I can see why
you're so scared, Dad.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.878
Where's Mom?

15:44.878 --> 15:46.212
I don't know.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.547
I want to see her!

15:47.547 --> 15:49.538
No!

15:55.688 --> 15:57.679
You calm down.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.286
I'm coming right back.

16:07.066 --> 16:08.727
(door closes)

16:16.342 --> 16:18.333
(wind whistling)

16:26.886 --> 16:28.054
(insects chirring)

16:28.054 --> 16:29.489
(door rattles)

16:29.489 --> 16:31.024
ROBERT:
Bobby?

16:31.024 --> 16:32.258
(door rattling)

16:32.258 --> 16:34.260
Bobby?! Bobby.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.852
-(door rattling)
-Open the door!

16:43.136 --> 16:45.127
(snarling)

16:46.573 --> 16:48.564
(growling)

16:54.647 --> 16:56.638
(howling)

17:02.155 --> 17:04.524
Janice.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.858
What are you doing here?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.493
Did you get the court order?

17:07.493 --> 17:09.629
The sheriff will serve it
to Robert tonight.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.197
Fine.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.188
I want to be there.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.536
I'm afraid
he's gonna hurt Bobby.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.527
Wait.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.974
I'll go with you.

17:20.974 --> 17:22.965
Okay.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.316
(wind whistling)

17:30.316 --> 17:32.118
(knocking)

17:32.118 --> 17:35.281
Mr. Perry, are you there?

17:40.226 --> 17:41.995
Oh...!

17:41.995 --> 17:43.997
What happened here?

17:43.997 --> 17:45.865
Mr. Perry?

17:45.865 --> 17:46.957
Bobby?!

17:52.138 --> 17:53.162
(woman gasps)

17:55.208 --> 17:56.976
Take it easy.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.144
(Janice whimpering)

17:58.144 --> 18:00.339
Just... take it easy.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.582
Here.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.217
You wait here.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.752
I'll be right back.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.221
I'll go in and see about Bobby.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.155
Don't move.

18:18.965 --> 18:21.126
(door creaking)

18:33.212 --> 18:34.747
(rustling)

18:34.747 --> 18:37.307
Bobby?

18:44.757 --> 18:47.660
Bobby?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.184
(panting)

18:50.530 --> 18:53.332
Bobby... Bobby, come on.

18:53.332 --> 18:54.734
We have to go now.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.102
(panting continues)

18:56.102 --> 18:58.671
WOMAN: Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.007
-(Bobby snarling)
-Bobby?

19:01.007 --> 19:03.810
(snarling)

19:03.810 --> 19:05.801
(growling)

19:09.382 --> 19:11.714
(growling continues)

19:14.353 --> 19:16.255
(fierce growl)

19:16.255 --> 19:17.690
(howling)

19:17.690 --> 19:20.181
(screaming, growling)

19:24.363 --> 19:27.300
Help me! Help me, please!

19:27.300 --> 19:28.568
I can't get this thing...

19:28.568 --> 19:29.802
Can't...

19:29.802 --> 19:31.370
Get out of here!

19:31.370 --> 19:32.605
Your husband was right.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.096
He's some sort of a monster!

19:40.313 --> 19:42.304
Get away.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.785
I'll take care of it.

19:45.785 --> 19:46.774
No!

19:48.821 --> 19:50.389
(gunshot)

19:50.389 --> 19:53.654
(snarling)

19:58.097 --> 20:00.088
(growling)

20:05.304 --> 20:06.606
No...

20:06.606 --> 20:08.975
No!

20:08.975 --> 20:10.510
-(grow|ing)
-(woman whimpering)

20:10.510 --> 20:12.603
(woman screaming)

20:16.482 --> 20:18.473
(growling continues)

20:19.652 --> 20:21.779
(fierce growl)

20:57.156 --> 20:59.590
(both howling)

21:03.062 --> 21:05.394
(howling continues)

21:18.544 --> 21:22.348
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:22.348 --> 21:24.884
Waiting for us to enter.

21:24.884 --> 21:28.120
Waiting to enter us.

21:28.120 --> 21:34.355
Until next time,
try to enjoy the daylight.
