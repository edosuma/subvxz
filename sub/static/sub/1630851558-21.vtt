WEBVTT

00:10.533 --> 00:12.867
You know, this season
we put a lot of our eggs

00:12.900 --> 00:15.166
in the Mud Mountain basket

00:15.200 --> 00:18.033
and it's really not paying
off like we expected.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.000
Less than a month

00:21.033 --> 00:23.100
before winter
freezes him out,

00:23.133 --> 00:26.133
Parker Schnabel's season
is in the balance.

00:29.467 --> 00:31.567
I don't even know if we're
gonna break even in it

00:31.600 --> 00:33.667
which is a real bummer,

00:33.700 --> 00:35.300
spent a lot of money in there

00:35.333 --> 00:36.867
and everybody
killed themselves

00:36.900 --> 00:38.333
trying to make it happen.

00:38.367 --> 00:40.367
Parker has spent
four months

00:40.400 --> 00:42.533
and four and a half
million dollars

00:42.567 --> 00:45.233
getting to pay dirt
at Mud Mountain

00:45.266 --> 00:47.100
searching for a hotspot

00:47.133 --> 00:50.166
that could hold
8,000 ounces of gold.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.400
The piece that's left though
is the center of the cuts

00:53.433 --> 00:55.467
where the best drilling was
that Liam did

00:55.500 --> 00:58.967
and so hopefully at eight,
ten ounces an hour,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.333
it doesn't take long
to have a really good cleanup,

01:02.367 --> 01:03.867
so there's still hope.

01:03.900 --> 01:05.567
If last week's scale

01:05.600 --> 01:09.300
busting 600 ounces
is any indication,

01:09.333 --> 01:12.533
they may have hit
a massive honey hole.

01:14.066 --> 01:16.166
We had an awesome week
with Big Red last week.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.634
We will just try and keep
that momentum going but,

01:18.667 --> 01:20.467
you know, we don't know
what exactly we're gonna find

01:20.500 --> 01:22.033
as we keep going
through Mud Mountain.

01:22.066 --> 01:24.467
Was that, you know,
just one really good spot

01:24.500 --> 01:26.834
or is the rest of it gonna run
that way, we don't know.

01:28.233 --> 01:30.800
While Mitch
works through Mud Mountain,

01:30.834 --> 01:32.934
Parker is relying
on Tyson Lee

01:32.967 --> 01:35.500
to get through
the Promised Land pay dirt

01:35.533 --> 01:38.767
before winter shuts him down.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.533
We just started the ugly cut

01:40.567 --> 01:43.333
and the first week
is what decides

01:43.367 --> 01:44.900
how things are gonna go.

01:46.100 --> 01:47.367
You know,
this is the last place

01:47.400 --> 01:49.200
this wash plant's gonna be
this season,

01:49.233 --> 01:52.200
so I wanna make it a good one
and make it count.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.200
Are you driving?

02:00.266 --> 02:01.900
Go on, move your bum.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.834
Move your...

02:05.867 --> 02:09.634
I didn't say lie down,
I said move.

02:09.667 --> 02:10.867
You know,
there's not much time

02:10.900 --> 02:12.166
to get through this ground.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.734
The pressure is on,
the heat is on,

02:13.767 --> 02:16.533
we have to get this pay
down in here.

02:16.567 --> 02:19.600
Sluicing
an eight-acre cut like this

02:19.634 --> 02:21.767
normally takes six weeks

02:21.800 --> 02:25.033
but winter will likely hit
in less than four.

02:25.066 --> 02:26.533
You know, so far,
we've been sluicing

02:26.567 --> 02:27.934
in the ugly cut.

02:27.967 --> 02:30.934
The wash plant pad
is looking pretty good,

02:30.967 --> 02:33.634
the biggest wash plant pad
we've built this year

02:33.667 --> 02:36.867
and, you know,
I'm definitely liking it.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.133
First couple of days
was a little sketchy but,

02:39.166 --> 02:41.133
you know,
we're almost at the point

02:41.166 --> 02:44.166
where the wash plant's
not gonna go anywhere.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.533
Whoa, whoa, Jerry,
shut her down.

02:52.567 --> 02:53.734
Shut her down.

03:01.467 --> 03:03.634
Oh, my

03:17.166 --> 03:19.200
Well, the belt stopped.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.333
And now
it's all backed up here

03:21.367 --> 03:24.600
and we have to shovel to see

03:24.634 --> 03:27.634
if we can get the conveyer
to work again.

03:33.834 --> 03:35.700
- Watch yourself, Tat.
- Okay.

03:37.934 --> 03:38.934
Junk.

03:40.033 --> 03:41.266
- No?
- No.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.066
Okay.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.834
The belt's just loading up
and not spinning so...

03:46.867 --> 03:48.834
but this is a normal amount
of dirt

03:48.867 --> 03:50.867
for this thing to have on it.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.166
Hey, Tat, I'm gonna try it
again here.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.367
Okay.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.567
There's no way
this much material

03:57.600 --> 03:59.066
should be holding
this thing up.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.000
This is a problem
we've had happen

04:02.033 --> 04:04.233
many times in the past

04:04.266 --> 04:06.200
with these conveyers and...

04:08.934 --> 04:13.233
But why it does not wanna go?

04:14.333 --> 04:15.533
I do not know.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.066
Hey, Mitch,
you got a copy, Mitch?

04:24.100 --> 04:25.333
Yeah, go ahead.

04:35.533 --> 04:36.934
Yeah, you can see here,

04:36.967 --> 04:38.834
this is one
of the ball bearings

04:38.867 --> 04:40.967
that should be inside
that bearing.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.133
Uh, there's a whole pile
of them right there.

04:43.166 --> 04:44.867
We're gonna need
to throw some bearings

04:44.900 --> 04:47.233
and we're gonna lose probably
the rest of the dayshift today

04:47.266 --> 04:49.367
but hopefully we can have it
running by nightshift.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.467
- Hopefully.
- Yeah.

04:54.567 --> 04:56.934
Alec just ran back to the yard
to grab the bearings.

04:56.967 --> 04:58.300
So what we're gonna do
right now is to start

04:58.333 --> 04:59.500
breaking everything down.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.900
As soon as we get this apart,

05:00.934 --> 05:02.233
we're gonna throw
those new parts in there

05:02.266 --> 05:03.900
and get it back together.

05:03.934 --> 05:05.767
Last time
they replaced the bearing

05:05.800 --> 05:08.533
on the conveyer,
it took four hours.

05:08.567 --> 05:10.533
Precious time
they can't afford

05:10.567 --> 05:12.700
this late in the season.

05:12.734 --> 05:15.233
Well, it's really important
we get this conveyer fixed,

05:15.266 --> 05:17.433
we get Slucifer fired back
up here before nightshift,

05:17.467 --> 05:18.734
we can get through this dirt.

05:20.133 --> 05:22.033
This is gonna need
to be like a pit stop.

05:24.467 --> 05:25.767
What do you think, Alec?

05:25.800 --> 05:27.567
Does it look like
we have the right ones?

05:27.600 --> 05:29.934
- Oh, yeah.
- Perfect.

05:29.967 --> 05:32.000
The biggest thing here
is just time.

05:32.033 --> 05:33.567
Alec, if you wanna start
busting things apart.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.767
- Yes.
- All right.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.734
- I'll see you in a few.
- See ya.

05:36.767 --> 05:38.233
First up,

05:38.266 --> 05:41.033
Alec and Tyson must remove
the drive motor

05:41.066 --> 05:43.066
to access the bearing unit.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.867
Oh, yeah.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.433
I wonder if we can just
man-bear-pig this thing,

05:48.467 --> 05:49.767
it's not that heavy.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.100
Okay.

05:54.033 --> 05:55.500
Oh, yeah.

05:55.533 --> 05:57.400
Bend those knees.

06:01.367 --> 06:04.066
Tyson takes
the weight of the driveshaft

06:04.100 --> 06:07.166
so Alec can remove
the bearings.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.433
That will do there.

06:09.467 --> 06:11.767
We're losing time
and time is money

06:11.800 --> 06:14.800
and, well, the cold weather
is only coming.

06:14.834 --> 06:16.266
Howdy, howdy.

06:16.300 --> 06:19.266
We'll get her cleaned up
and get it swapped out.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.700
We'd have lots of grease
in there but...

06:21.734 --> 06:24.500
- Sometimes it's just time.
- We're out.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.700
That is what's left of that.

06:27.734 --> 06:30.300
It's, uh, seen better days.

06:30.333 --> 06:34.834
It's the old, uh, tool truck
rebuild here.

06:34.867 --> 06:38.066
Get it thrown back together.
I like that.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.934
Oh, yeah, that's what
we're looking for right there.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.734
I think we're good.

06:42.767 --> 06:44.767
Come on.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.433
- Oh, man.
- Whoa.

06:47.467 --> 06:49.600
- Nice job.
- Yeah.

06:49.634 --> 06:51.934
Let's get sluicing.

06:51.967 --> 06:54.867
Alec and Tyson
attach the drive motor.

06:56.233 --> 06:58.100
Can't forget this part.

06:58.133 --> 06:59.400
Slucifer's been down

06:59.433 --> 07:00.900
over two hours longer

07:00.934 --> 07:03.266
than last time
they replaced the bearing

07:03.300 --> 07:07.066
and has cost Parker
nearly $30,000 in lost gold.

07:07.100 --> 07:08.734
Here we go.

07:08.767 --> 07:10.967
But they're ready
to fire back up.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.433
Moment of truth.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.500
So that was six
and a half hours of downtime

07:16.533 --> 07:18.333
that took from the time
we shut down

07:18.367 --> 07:20.166
to the time we fired up
and just in time,

07:20.200 --> 07:22.433
nightshift's gonna be here
any minute.

07:24.667 --> 07:27.867
All right. Here we go
with the first scoop,

07:27.900 --> 07:29.200
it's back up and running

07:29.233 --> 07:30.800
and we just got to keep her
that way.

07:51.934 --> 07:53.634
This season
has been a grind, man.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.800
There's only a couple weeks
left in the season,

07:55.834 --> 07:57.600
and we need to keep going
full throttle

07:57.634 --> 08:00.500
to hit our 2,000 ounce gold.

08:00.533 --> 08:02.800
In the mountains
above Keno City,

08:02.834 --> 08:04.433
mine boss Rick Ness

08:04.467 --> 08:06.900
is risking his future
as a gold miner

08:06.934 --> 08:11.467
on a colossal
190-foot deep cut.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.333
But after two months
mining Rally Valley,

08:14.367 --> 08:17.567
Rick is still 30 feet
from the best pay,

08:17.600 --> 08:21.000
which has two times
more gold per 100 yards

08:21.033 --> 08:22.767
than the rest of the cut.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.433
So we hit this gravel layer
that's, uh,

08:27.467 --> 08:29.400
quite away above me right now.

08:29.433 --> 08:31.367
I'm in a big panic
to get down here

08:31.400 --> 08:34.767
to that real good
bottom layer of pay

08:34.800 --> 08:37.033
which we're hoping
for about 30 to 40 feet up

08:37.066 --> 08:38.467
before bedrock.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.133
That is one piece
of the puzzle

08:40.166 --> 08:43.367
we really need to get us
2,000 ounces or more.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.467
In order to get
to the finish line,

08:46.500 --> 08:49.133
I called somebody up,
he's always been there for me.

08:49.166 --> 08:50.867
He's actually showing up today

08:50.900 --> 08:52.367
and I'm hoping he brings
the energy

08:52.400 --> 08:53.734
that we're gonna need.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.400
Time's running out for Rick.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.300
You know,
in this gold mining business,

09:00.333 --> 09:01.634
it's make it
or break it stuff

09:01.667 --> 09:03.166
because it can ruin you.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.934
I mean, it can totally
ruin you financially.

09:09.033 --> 09:12.166
Being his dad, I mean,
I always kind of knew,

09:12.200 --> 09:13.967
you know, he was
a little bit adventurous,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.700
but I never I guess
would have guessed that

09:16.734 --> 09:18.800
he would have been
this much of a gambler.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.133
This business,

09:20.166 --> 09:21.967
it's a gamble
no matter what they say.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.400
I mean,
that's my biggest worry,

09:24.433 --> 09:27.000
uh, with him doing this.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.400
Rick went out on his own

09:28.433 --> 09:30.700
and it's actually scary,
to be honest.

09:30.734 --> 09:32.033
But he's got
the experience now,

09:32.066 --> 09:33.367
he knows what he's doing,

09:33.400 --> 09:35.033
and the end result
hopefully, you know,

09:35.066 --> 09:37.200
will be a good pay out.

09:37.233 --> 09:39.967
I know he's a little behind
in his goal that he's got set

09:40.000 --> 09:42.400
and, uh, maybe I can help
give him that extra push

09:42.433 --> 09:43.767
and try to meet his goal.

09:45.934 --> 09:47.500
At Rally Valley,

09:47.533 --> 09:51.100
Monster Red is chewing
through 300 yards an hour

09:51.133 --> 09:54.533
of gold rich pay dirt
with just a skeleton crew.

09:56.266 --> 09:58.066
I've been struggling
to find people all year

09:58.100 --> 10:00.100
and so it's great
because I get to see my dad,

10:00.133 --> 10:01.767
but also he gets
to put in the work

10:01.800 --> 10:04.066
and that's something
I desperately need right now.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.333
You know,
he runs all this equipment,

10:05.367 --> 10:07.333
he can fix stuff.
So it's just...

10:07.367 --> 10:09.600
he's a good guy to have here
at the end of the season,

10:09.634 --> 10:12.133
especially when we, uh,
we need a little fresh energy

10:12.166 --> 10:15.033
for, uh,
end of the season push.

10:18.667 --> 10:21.033
Oh, look at that.

10:27.133 --> 10:28.500
- Good to see you, Dad.
- Good to see you, son.

10:28.533 --> 10:30.667
- You made it.
- Oh, my

10:30.700 --> 10:32.433
- Man.
- Holy, I am impressed.

10:32.467 --> 10:34.367
This is one hell
of an operation.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.367
- Holy
- Yeah.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.600
It got a little bigger
this year.

10:37.634 --> 10:38.934
No kidding. Wow.

10:38.967 --> 10:40.667
I, uh, I don't even know
what to say.

10:40.700 --> 10:41.767
It's unreal.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.200
We got a long ways to go.

10:43.233 --> 10:44.900
But we've been, you know,

10:44.934 --> 10:46.433
sure you see the big hole
on the way in,

10:46.467 --> 10:48.634
we've been going very,
very deep and, you know,

10:48.667 --> 10:50.734
trying to hit this good pay
at the bottom.

10:50.767 --> 10:52.467
You know,
stuff that drilled out at...

10:52.500 --> 10:54.066
three ounces
per hundred yards.

10:54.100 --> 10:56.266
We have to get because
with the time we have left,

10:56.300 --> 10:57.600
we have to be running
that stuff

10:57.634 --> 10:59.166
to be able to hit 2000 ounces.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.700
Wow. That's crazy.

11:01.734 --> 11:03.967
How many people you got
working right now?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.166
Uh, eight.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.567
Holy I can't believe
what you have gotten done

11:08.600 --> 11:09.867
with just eight people?

11:09.900 --> 11:11.300
Yeah, we just been...

11:11.333 --> 11:13.300
Whoever I can find
to fill in where needed.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.834
Everybody's doing
two or three jobs,

11:14.867 --> 11:16.800
that's just how it's gone.

11:16.834 --> 11:19.767
So, uh, well, I came up here
to give you a hand, man.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.200
And, uh, I mean, whatever
you need me to do, right?

11:22.233 --> 11:23.867
I'm here to help you,
whatever you want.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.634
Well, yeah,
there's plenty for you to do.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.300
Well, find me a machine
or something, man.

11:27.333 --> 11:28.767
I'll go ahead
and jump right into her.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.333
All right, let's do it.

11:33.634 --> 11:34.934
It's great my dad's here,

11:34.967 --> 11:36.734
you know, he can do
a bit of everything.

11:36.767 --> 11:39.367
He's gonna be a massive help
to us getting 2,000 ounces.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.834
And now I get to share it
not only just

11:40.867 --> 11:43.100
with my small crew,
but with my dad as well.

11:45.567 --> 11:47.934
Rick puts his dad
straight to work

11:47.967 --> 11:52.133
feeding Monster Red
with the low grade pay.

11:52.166 --> 11:53.834
The amount of time
and effort and money

11:53.867 --> 11:56.333
that they put in
to stripping this overburden

11:56.367 --> 11:59.467
to get to that pay layer
is just astronomical.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.700
It's always my goal
to make sure that

12:01.734 --> 12:03.200
Rick succeeds,

12:03.233 --> 12:06.100
and I'll do what I have to
to, uh, help him.

12:06.133 --> 12:08.700
I just hope it pays off
for him.

12:08.734 --> 12:10.367
A hundred and twenty feet

12:10.400 --> 12:11.734
down in the cut,

12:11.767 --> 12:15.066
Foreman Brennan Ruault
digs the pay.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.634
Rick's old man showed up
there today and, uh,

12:17.667 --> 12:20.200
you know, sure nice to have
an extra set of hands here

12:20.233 --> 12:22.233
if we need all the help
we can get right now.

12:22.266 --> 12:24.767
And, you know,
he's a super positive guy.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.033
Hey, Dad, how's that loader
working in that pile there

12:32.066 --> 12:33.867
kind of...kind of
some big rock, eh?

12:33.900 --> 12:36.166
Yeah, this stuff is,
uh, brutal.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.734
I'm trying not to spin
the tires

12:37.767 --> 12:39.600
and go easy on the machine.

12:39.634 --> 12:40.934
Yeah, exactly.

12:40.967 --> 12:42.600
Yeah, we need to take care
of that thing.

12:42.634 --> 12:44.834
It's getting kind of late now
on the season, eh?

12:44.867 --> 12:46.100
Yeah, I'm nervous about it.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.367
We've got a lot of gold to get

12:47.400 --> 12:49.667
before we can leave.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.900
So what you're saying is
if it snowed and it's cold,

12:52.934 --> 12:54.667
I'm still gonna be here?

12:56.734 --> 12:58.900
I believe, you got...
you got better things to do?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.600
It's just a pleasure
to be here

13:01.634 --> 13:03.634
and see your operation

13:03.667 --> 13:05.500
and be able to say
I can help you.

13:05.533 --> 13:06.700
I love it.

13:16.533 --> 13:19.533
What the hell...

13:23.533 --> 13:25.700
wrong with this thing.

13:49.867 --> 13:52.166
What in the...
I don't know what's going on

13:52.200 --> 13:54.533
with this thing
but the damn thing

13:54.567 --> 13:56.467
decided to...
It don't wanna lift,

13:56.500 --> 13:58.634
the thing got no power
or something here.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.100
Deep in the Rally Valley,

14:01.133 --> 14:04.166
Brennan Ruault's
700 excavator

14:04.200 --> 14:06.500
has lost its lifting power.

14:06.533 --> 14:08.567
damn it.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.400
Got a copy there, Rick?

14:12.600 --> 14:14.600
Yeah, go for Rick.

14:14.634 --> 14:16.200
Hey, buddy, I don't know
what's going on

14:16.233 --> 14:17.233
in the 700 here.

14:17.266 --> 14:18.667
This thing seems like

14:18.700 --> 14:20.400
it doesn't have any power
anymore to dig.

14:20.433 --> 14:21.734
I don't know, like,

14:21.767 --> 14:23.233
it's losing pressure
or something.

14:23.266 --> 14:25.300
I have no idea
what it might be here.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.533
This is getting painful.

14:28.567 --> 14:31.100
I can barely get
through the ground.

14:31.133 --> 14:32.467
Uh, okay. Yeah.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.800
Um, give me a second.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.700
Uh, hey, Dad,
are you on the radio?

14:37.333 --> 14:39.266
Yep, I'm here. Go ahead.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.000
Dad, 700 is coming out
of the cut.

14:41.033 --> 14:43.367
Um, do you think you could go
take a look at it?

14:43.400 --> 14:45.600
Uh, see if you could fix it,
see what's wrong with it.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.867
We really need
that machine.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.667
Yeah, roger that.
I'll, uh,

14:49.700 --> 14:51.767
I'll take a run over there
and get a good look at it.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.300
Rick Sr. spent 40 years

14:54.333 --> 14:56.567
in the family
construction business,

14:56.600 --> 14:58.300
running, managing,

14:58.333 --> 15:01.200
and fixing heavy equipment.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.100
If my dad can't get
that 700 fixed,

15:03.133 --> 15:05.767
there's no way we're gonna hit
our 2,000 ounce goal.

15:21.834 --> 15:25.400
So, the main boom cylinder
on the 700 here

15:25.433 --> 15:27.200
is fed by...

15:27.233 --> 15:29.433
those hydraulic tubes
to those hydraulic hoses.

15:29.467 --> 15:31.634
Well, one of them tubes
has a T on it

15:31.667 --> 15:33.667
and, uh, it's been...

15:33.700 --> 15:35.834
Appears to be fixed
from before

15:35.867 --> 15:37.900
but the welds have cracked

15:37.934 --> 15:40.867
and now we're chasing
those cracks with more weld.

15:43.433 --> 15:45.066
The boom arm is operated

15:45.100 --> 15:48.166
by four hydraulic cylinders,

15:48.200 --> 15:50.500
powered by pressurized fluid

15:50.533 --> 15:52.734
fed to the cylinders
through hoses

15:52.767 --> 15:55.200
connected with a T-joint.

15:55.233 --> 15:57.033
The T-joint is cracked,

15:57.066 --> 16:00.433
causing the 700
to lose power.

16:00.467 --> 16:02.133
To get it back in action,

16:02.166 --> 16:05.767
Rick Sr. will patch
the cracks with welds.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.500
This is just a quick fix
to get it back to work.

16:10.533 --> 16:12.767
But if there's any oil
in that crack at all,

16:12.800 --> 16:15.000
it ain't gonna seal up,
you know,

16:15.033 --> 16:16.934
without draining
the whole system.

16:16.967 --> 16:18.967
Just kind of keep an eye on it
when I weld on it

16:19.000 --> 16:20.767
because there's so much grease
and oil in there,

16:20.800 --> 16:22.233
I'm worried about fire.

16:28.667 --> 16:32.400
Big Rick has joined us,
clearly perfect timing.

16:32.433 --> 16:35.200
The guy can run anything here.

16:35.233 --> 16:36.900
I think our chances
are improving again

16:36.934 --> 16:38.533
to 2,000 ounces.

16:38.567 --> 16:40.266
I mean, it certainly
can't hurt.

16:52.834 --> 16:54.066
Come on.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.433
The material is so light,
I blew a hole in it,

17:00.467 --> 17:02.233
now it's worse.

17:02.266 --> 17:03.900
Before, it was such
a hairline crack,

17:03.934 --> 17:05.600
so I thought
if I could chase it real quick

17:05.634 --> 17:08.567
with a weld and seal it up,

17:08.600 --> 17:11.367
but it popped out and...

17:11.400 --> 17:13.166
started blowing oil.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.300
Now, I got a hole
bigger than I had before.

17:16.333 --> 17:18.200
And so we're probably
looking at...

17:18.233 --> 17:20.600
another day away from...

17:20.634 --> 17:21.967
being able to use it.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.634
We're looking
at a challenge right now

17:52.667 --> 17:54.700
that many people would
probably turn away from.

17:54.734 --> 17:56.533
These guys are trained
in combat

17:56.567 --> 18:00.066
and we're not gonna stop
until we're on gold.

18:00.100 --> 18:03.266
Fred Lewis
has mined 71 ounces

18:03.300 --> 18:05.700
towards his 100-ounce
season goal.

18:06.967 --> 18:08.233
So we're teamed up
with the Claytons

18:08.266 --> 18:09.700
to save both of our seasons.

18:09.734 --> 18:11.300
You know, it's thinking
outside the box

18:11.333 --> 18:12.500
and it's solving the problem.

18:14.133 --> 18:15.734
Fred has joined forces

18:15.767 --> 18:19.233
with neighboring miners
Brandon and Brady Clayton.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.867
We're putting
all of our money

18:20.900 --> 18:22.266
on their good pay.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.700
With this team-up
with the Claytons,

18:23.734 --> 18:26.066
we've really stepped up
our game.

18:26.100 --> 18:29.967
Fred has shut down
his small wash plant,

18:30.000 --> 18:33.333
gambling on combining
manpower and equipment

18:33.367 --> 18:35.967
to run pay
at 90 yards an hour

18:36.000 --> 18:39.133
through the Clayton's trommel
24/7,

18:39.166 --> 18:41.900
splitting the gold 50-50.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.100
You know, the collaboration,
I like it.

18:46.133 --> 18:47.266
I can tell
that everybody is trying

18:47.300 --> 18:48.800
not to be the weakest link.

18:48.834 --> 18:51.233
There's no time for slack,
that's for sure.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.467
All of us
are former military guys,

18:55.500 --> 18:57.734
but gold mining is all new.

18:57.767 --> 18:59.867
This is the chance
of a lifetime, and fun,

18:59.900 --> 19:02.266
and challenging, and all that.

19:02.300 --> 19:06.133
But finding enough gold
to be able to go home with

19:06.166 --> 19:09.066
and have it worth being here.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.467
Oh, this is probably
the worst weather we've had

19:14.500 --> 19:16.433
since we got here.
I filled my rain barrel,

19:16.467 --> 19:17.867
it's 55 gallons,

19:17.900 --> 19:21.133
and I filled it in one night
on my RV,

19:21.166 --> 19:23.634
so it rained a lot.

19:23.667 --> 19:24.934
Freddy, you got a copy?

19:26.333 --> 19:27.900
This is Fred.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.967
Hey, Fred,
we need you down our cut

19:30.000 --> 19:32.900
as soon as possible,
we got an issue down here.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.400
Roger that,
I'll be right there.

19:52.734 --> 19:53.900
That doesn't look good.

19:58.166 --> 19:59.834
That's a lot of water.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.667
Oh, no.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.367
What the hell are we gonna do
about that?

20:10.400 --> 20:13.767
Overnight,
rain has burst a berm,

20:13.800 --> 20:17.100
and Brandon now has a river
running through his cut.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.634
I don't know, man.

20:18.667 --> 20:21.066
I don't think we can pull
pay out on my side.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.100
I think we gotta resort
to your side.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.667
Pulling from over there until
this is accessible again?

20:31.700 --> 20:35.033
Yeah. Throw everything we got
at your side.

20:35.066 --> 20:37.634
What we've got over there
is only averaging 0.6, 0.7,

20:37.667 --> 20:39.600
so we're gonna have to pull
a hell of a lot more dirt

20:39.634 --> 20:41.166
to pick up for this two ounce
a hundred...

20:41.200 --> 20:42.700
- Yeah.
- stuff.

20:42.734 --> 20:44.500
The pay in Brandon's cut

20:44.533 --> 20:48.367
delivers three times
as much gold as Fred's.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.900
We ain't pulling
from here.

20:49.934 --> 20:51.600
- No.
- So we go to my side.

20:51.634 --> 20:53.700
I'll get my guys focused,
you get your guys focused.

20:53.734 --> 20:55.300
we'll get it...we'll get it...
we'll get it done.

20:55.333 --> 20:56.700
We need a little more yards
now though.

20:56.734 --> 20:58.700
Oh, sure. See you later, Fred.

20:58.734 --> 21:00.300
- Yeah.
- See you, mate.

21:01.567 --> 21:03.667
You know,
this really sucks bad.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.233
Right now,
the high-quality pay

21:05.266 --> 21:06.634
is underwater,

21:06.667 --> 21:09.767
so the big gamble we played
to come out here

21:09.800 --> 21:12.333
put us right back
on our ground.

21:12.367 --> 21:13.934
And this really sucks.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.500
To maintain production,

21:19.533 --> 21:23.100
Fred will have to deliver
three times as much pay,

21:23.133 --> 21:25.333
so he needs
to radically speed up

21:25.367 --> 21:28.367
how fast he hauls it
from his claim,

21:28.400 --> 21:31.667
half a mile
to the Clayton's wash plant,

21:31.700 --> 21:33.100
Dirt Devil.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.700
At this point, I'm gonna have
to look at my operation

21:37.734 --> 21:40.667
and see if there's ways
I can speed up my feed.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.233
I don't think
there's anything we can do

21:42.266 --> 21:43.800
with the equipment we have.

21:43.834 --> 21:46.300
So I'm going to have
to figure something out here,

21:46.333 --> 21:47.967
and I don't really know
what to do,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.300
but something has to be done.

21:50.333 --> 21:52.300
Gonna have to think
outside the box here.

21:57.967 --> 22:00.667
All right. We're gonna move
our wash plant out,

22:00.700 --> 22:03.000
- we're gonna pull it.
- Okay.

22:03.033 --> 22:04.500
- Pull it completely.
- Why?

22:04.533 --> 22:06.200
Pull more pay
and run more pay,

22:06.233 --> 22:09.033
we're gonna make this
road-efficient.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.533
We can pull a lot more pay
out of here

22:10.567 --> 22:11.734
with this method, I think.

22:11.767 --> 22:13.500
No more backing
the rock trucks up?

22:13.533 --> 22:15.433
Exactly. So we've gotta pull
our plant

22:15.467 --> 22:17.500
- to get access to our pay.
- Yeah.

22:17.533 --> 22:19.867
And we'll just drag it
to the pad

22:19.900 --> 22:21.900
that we've created over there
for the turnaround spots,

22:21.934 --> 22:23.400
and we'll just park it there.

22:23.433 --> 22:24.900
So that's the call,

22:24.934 --> 22:26.934
hopefully, we won't regret it.

22:26.967 --> 22:27.934
- All right.
- You guys good?

22:27.967 --> 22:28.934
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:28.967 --> 22:30.233
- All right.
- Mmm-hmm.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.400
I'm golden.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.867
There's a single track

22:36.900 --> 22:39.767
from Fred's cut
to the Clayton's wash plant.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.700
To create a loop
between the pay

22:41.734 --> 22:43.166
and the wash plant,

22:43.200 --> 22:45.233
Fred needs to haul
his wash plant

22:45.266 --> 22:46.700
out of the way,

22:46.734 --> 22:49.867
then build a second
half-mile road

22:49.900 --> 22:52.800
so that the rock trucks
can circulate freely

22:52.834 --> 22:55.300
and deliver enough pay
to the plant.

22:57.700 --> 22:59.667
All right, guys.
This is probably the most

22:59.700 --> 23:01.567
dangerous part we have,
moving this wash plant.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.033
We'll have two guys
ground-guiding up,

23:03.066 --> 23:04.567
making sure nothing's going
on with the plant,

23:04.600 --> 23:06.000
we'll watch the conveyor,

23:06.033 --> 23:07.834
so you can just worry
about moving it.

23:07.867 --> 23:09.100
All right. Let's do it.

23:09.133 --> 23:11.300
- All right.
- We're doing it.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.734
Buzz will drag
Fred's wash plant

23:13.767 --> 23:15.834
50 yards out of the cut,

23:15.867 --> 23:17.333
up a steep bank,

23:17.367 --> 23:20.300
to clear the route
to the pay.

23:20.333 --> 23:23.266
So, it's really crucial that
we do this move correctly.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.233
We've gotta watch our conveyor

23:25.266 --> 23:26.567
to make sure
it's not bouncing a lot,

23:26.600 --> 23:28.800
that can also cause damage
in the frame.

23:28.834 --> 23:31.066
Because we don't own
this wash plant, it's leased,

23:31.100 --> 23:32.700
so if we break it, we buy it.

23:46.066 --> 23:47.333
Gently.

23:50.867 --> 23:52.433
It's only 12 tons.

23:52.467 --> 23:53.867
I know, right?

24:02.834 --> 24:04.333
All right.
You're coming up on that hill,

24:04.367 --> 24:05.300
you take it nice and easy,

24:05.333 --> 24:06.867
and we'll walk with you, okay?

24:10.967 --> 24:13.000
Whoa Buzz, you're right
on the edge over there.

24:13.033 --> 24:14.867
Yeah, you're running out
of space on this side

24:14.900 --> 24:17.433
and you're running out
of space on that side.

24:19.533 --> 24:21.834
Yeah.
You're lined up nice now.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.867
- Yay!
- All right.

24:28.900 --> 24:32.367
That's it, Buzz. Good job.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.133
Wash plant moved,

24:34.166 --> 24:37.200
Fred and his crew
will build a road

24:37.233 --> 24:39.767
using old tailings
to create a loop

24:39.800 --> 24:42.800
between the pay
and Brandon's plant.

24:42.834 --> 24:44.533
The reason why
we're so frantically

24:44.567 --> 24:46.100
trying to build this road

24:46.133 --> 24:47.600
is it's gonna give us
better access.

24:47.634 --> 24:50.467
So driving the rock truck now,

24:50.500 --> 24:52.767
we have to do
three-point turnarounds,

24:52.800 --> 24:53.967
there's a number of times

24:54.000 --> 24:55.567
we have to back up
into places.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.567
If we are able
to build this road,

24:57.600 --> 25:00.100
then we would have
almost a race track.

25:00.133 --> 25:01.934
So, the truck
would never have to back up,

25:01.967 --> 25:04.000
it would constantly always
just be moving forward.

25:04.033 --> 25:05.967
Because we know efficiency
is the key

25:06.000 --> 25:07.533
and the name of the game
to gold mining.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.367
After six hours,

25:16.400 --> 25:19.000
Fred and his crew
have built a loop road,

25:19.033 --> 25:23.900
cutting the time it takes
to bring pay to the plant.

25:23.934 --> 25:25.634
We're done.
We are done.

25:25.667 --> 25:26.800
We now have access

25:26.834 --> 25:28.533
to all the pay
we need access to,

25:28.567 --> 25:29.734
and we can get it over
to Brandon's side

25:29.767 --> 25:30.934
really quickly now.

25:30.967 --> 25:32.100
We'll be sending trucks
in one way,

25:32.133 --> 25:33.066
get it filled up
with pay dirt

25:33.100 --> 25:34.166
and coming out the other way.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.133
And we can keep that up,

25:35.166 --> 25:36.467
we'll hit those numbers
we're looking for

25:36.500 --> 25:37.433
and this will be a good move.

25:52.367 --> 25:54.333
There's just no way
I'm gonna be able to keep up

25:54.367 --> 25:55.734
with tailings on this thing.

25:55.767 --> 25:57.500
We can wave
2,000 ounces goodbye,

25:57.533 --> 25:58.700
that's for damn sure.

25:58.734 --> 26:00.800
At Duncan Creek,

26:00.834 --> 26:04.333
Rick's vital 700 excavator
is down

26:04.367 --> 26:06.900
with a cracked
hydraulic line.

26:06.934 --> 26:08.600
He's come up
with a workaround,

26:08.634 --> 26:11.367
but it's slowing him down.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.834
Rick brought down the 754

26:13.867 --> 26:16.800
and we threw the 330 up there
to do tailings.

26:16.834 --> 26:19.600
As long as we can keep
this gold rolling up
to the plant,

26:19.634 --> 26:22.967
that's the only thing
that matters.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.600
The 700's got, you know,

26:24.634 --> 26:26.533
the four and a half yards
bucket on it,

26:26.567 --> 26:28.600
and, you know, this 330,

26:28.634 --> 26:31.567
it's barely even
a yard-sized bucket so,

26:31.600 --> 26:34.934
you know, four times
the amount of scoops.

26:34.967 --> 26:36.367
To keep Monster Red running,

26:36.400 --> 26:38.233
Rick needs to clear

26:38.266 --> 26:41.900
over 400 tons of tailings
every hour.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.667
it's gonna take me
30 buckets

26:44.700 --> 26:47.734
to fill a rock truck.

26:47.767 --> 26:49.400
Rick Sr. is racing

26:49.433 --> 26:52.867
to get the 700 excavator
back into service.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.266
I thought my days
of playing mechanic

26:57.300 --> 27:01.266
were over a long time ago,
but I guess not.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.634
It's now that I'm up here
looking closer,

27:03.667 --> 27:07.967
it got... It got freaking
welds on both sides of this T,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.734
up and down, and the back,
it's a...

27:10.767 --> 27:12.834
it's a disaster.

27:12.867 --> 27:15.433
It's weld on top of weld
on top of weld on top of weld.

27:18.133 --> 27:21.700
When Rick welded up
a T-joint on the 700,

27:21.734 --> 27:23.600
he burned a hole through it.

27:23.634 --> 27:26.600
Now, he must drain
the hydraulic fluid

27:26.634 --> 27:30.967
before he can re-weld
the T-joint.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.166
Hopefully,
we can get the oil

27:32.200 --> 27:33.967
out of the...
out of the system,

27:34.000 --> 27:35.333
because oil will not
allow you to weld.

27:35.367 --> 27:38.367
We're running 300 yards
an hour

27:38.400 --> 27:40.166
and we're producing
a lot of tailings,

27:40.200 --> 27:44.900
so if my dad can't get that
700 fixed and soon,

27:44.934 --> 27:46.767
it's almost a guarantee
that we're gonna have

27:46.800 --> 27:48.233
to turn down
to 200 yards an hour

27:48.266 --> 27:50.867
for them to be able
to keep up.

27:50.900 --> 27:53.867
No oil.
That's awesome.

27:53.900 --> 27:57.100
Now that we have evacuated
the oil

27:57.133 --> 27:58.934
over to that tube there,

27:58.967 --> 28:01.033
we got a lot
better fighting chance

28:01.066 --> 28:03.066
of sealing up with weld,

28:03.100 --> 28:05.200
because we're not fighting
the oil.

28:10.800 --> 28:14.233
This would be a miracle
if this freaking holds.

28:14.266 --> 28:17.934
All right.
So now, I'm gonna fire it up.

28:17.967 --> 28:20.100
After three hours of welding,

28:20.133 --> 28:22.000
it's the moment of truth.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.266
If the welds don't hold,

28:24.300 --> 28:26.867
the 700 can't dig tailings

28:26.900 --> 28:30.700
and Rick will have
to slow down the plant.

28:30.734 --> 28:32.867
First things first, we'll just
watch for a leak as it idles,

28:32.900 --> 28:35.100
and if it leaks when it idles,

28:35.133 --> 28:36.900
then we're really

28:36.934 --> 28:38.700
If it doesn't,
then we'll run it up,

28:38.734 --> 28:40.033
we're gonna run the boom up
in the air

28:40.066 --> 28:41.567
until it hits the stop,

28:41.600 --> 28:44.333
and then I'll put
quite a bit of pressure on it

28:44.367 --> 28:45.867
to see what it does then.

29:12.967 --> 29:15.634
Sweet.

29:15.667 --> 29:17.900
Looking really good,
really good.

29:17.934 --> 29:20.600
And I put full pressure
on her, wide open.

29:20.634 --> 29:22.567
And we got
the 700 repaired here,

29:22.600 --> 29:24.634
and we gotta get it back
in the cut

29:24.667 --> 29:27.400
if we have any hope of meeting
that 2,000-ounce goal,

29:27.433 --> 29:29.934
this thing's gotta be
in the cut.

29:29.967 --> 29:32.166
After two days of work,

29:32.200 --> 29:35.934
the 700 is back
up and running.

29:35.967 --> 29:37.400
So nice that my dad was able

29:37.433 --> 29:38.767
to get that 700 back
up and running.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.200
Having someone like dad around
is just invaluable.

29:41.233 --> 29:42.567
I wish I could afford my dad,

29:42.600 --> 29:43.900
I'd have him work here fulltime,

29:43.934 --> 29:47.233
but just to have him here
for a couple of weeks is...

29:47.266 --> 29:48.400
Man, it's so nice,

29:48.433 --> 29:49.533
especially
at the end of the season.

29:49.567 --> 29:51.667
Now, we don't have a lot
of time to be messing around,

29:51.700 --> 29:55.166
so luckily,
we're back up and on target,

29:55.200 --> 29:57.233
and hopefully,
that 2,000-ounce goal

29:57.266 --> 29:59.100
is within reach.

30:12.767 --> 30:13.867
If things don't pick up,

30:13.900 --> 30:17.567
we're at pretty high risk
of not beating last season.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.767
It's a good thing we've got
such good people out there.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.533
We've got a great group
of mechanics,

30:21.567 --> 30:24.533
we've got great managers

30:24.567 --> 30:25.800
that are keeping things running

30:25.834 --> 30:26.967
and doing a really good job.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.367
Everybody's gonna step up.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.634
There's a lot of people
stepping up.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.400
And they certainly
don't need me

30:31.433 --> 30:32.767
running around the mine site.

30:32.800 --> 30:36.166
Parker Schnabel's streak
of successful seasons

30:36.200 --> 30:40.433
depends on how much gold his
trusted lieutenants can mine

30:40.467 --> 30:42.567
in the next four weeks.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.400
All right. Now, I have Tatiana

30:44.433 --> 30:46.433
feeding the plant,
Froggy digging pay,

30:46.467 --> 30:49.967
and I'm doing coarse tailings.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.300
At the Ugly Cut,

30:51.333 --> 30:55.734
Tyson's under pressure
to keep the gold coming in.

30:55.767 --> 30:58.066
You know, we only have
a certain amount of days
of sluicing left

30:58.100 --> 31:02.000
and every minute counts
right now.

31:02.033 --> 31:04.800
Loader operator,
Tatiana Costa,

31:04.834 --> 31:09.433
feeds Slucifer 240 yards
of pay dirt an hour.

31:09.467 --> 31:12.066
We currently
only have one loader,

31:12.100 --> 31:16.967
so we... I'm really trying
to do all I can

31:17.000 --> 31:19.667
to be nice and easy
with this loader

31:19.700 --> 31:21.300
to make sure
we do not break down

31:21.333 --> 31:24.100
because that will be
catastrophic right now.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.600
Hey, Tyson,
you got a copy, Tyson?

31:38.634 --> 31:40.867
Go ahead, Tater tots.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.667
Uh, there's something wrong
with the plant.

31:43.700 --> 31:46.000
If you could come over here
and have a look.

31:46.033 --> 31:47.233
I'm on my way.

31:56.900 --> 31:59.166
Something's wrong
with our pump.

32:05.100 --> 32:07.934
Hey, Alec,
you got a copy, Alec?

32:07.967 --> 32:08.967
Yeah, go ahead.

32:20.333 --> 32:21.934
What's going on, Alec?

32:21.967 --> 32:24.300
So we're not getting
as much water

32:24.333 --> 32:26.700
out of the water pump
as we should be.

32:26.734 --> 32:28.300
Because the fan
was not quite spinning

32:28.333 --> 32:29.467
and the crankshaft
was basically

32:29.500 --> 32:31.400
slipping on the belt

32:31.433 --> 32:33.066
and then I noticed
that stall in here

32:33.100 --> 32:35.500
and you can see like
it's been wearing all night.

32:35.533 --> 32:40.400
Literally, the belt
just coming apart on us.

32:40.433 --> 32:42.567
Slucifer's 10-inch water pump

32:42.600 --> 32:44.533
is powered by a generator.

32:44.567 --> 32:46.934
A fan cools the engine.

32:46.967 --> 32:50.300
The belt driving
the fan has worn so thin,

32:50.333 --> 32:52.600
it's no longer spinning
the fan.

32:52.634 --> 32:54.200
The result,

32:54.233 --> 32:55.800
an overheated engine.

32:58.166 --> 32:59.900
We actually don't have
a backup water pump

33:01.200 --> 33:03.734
and it's pretty concerning

33:03.767 --> 33:05.433
seeing as we got
a whole cut to sluice out.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.533
What's up?

33:14.567 --> 33:16.266
So the plant pump
is giving us some grief,

33:16.300 --> 33:18.967
wondering if you have
a different pump lying around

33:19.000 --> 33:21.767
that we can steal
and put into play.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.400
No, they just...

33:23.433 --> 33:26.200
The motor is pretty much shot
on that other backup one.

33:26.233 --> 33:28.734
It's the fan belt on it,

33:28.767 --> 33:31.533
it's slipping and
kind of overheating on us

33:31.567 --> 33:36.467
so we're gonna need a new belt
or a different pump or...

33:36.500 --> 33:38.300
And you're gonna lose
four hours of sluicing

33:38.333 --> 33:39.767
if we have to send someone
to town?

33:39.800 --> 33:42.133
Yup.

33:42.166 --> 33:44.333
The four-hour
round trip to Dawson

33:44.367 --> 33:47.800
for the new fan belt
is going to cost Parker

33:47.834 --> 33:51.033
over $17,000 in downtime.

33:51.066 --> 33:53.266
Okay. I'll get on this.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.333
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.266
Yeah.
I need to call in a favor.

33:57.300 --> 33:58.900
When can you be here?

33:58.934 --> 34:00.634
I can't afford for us

34:00.667 --> 34:02.667
to drag on any longer
than it has to.

34:13.900 --> 34:15.567
Right now, all I know is

34:15.600 --> 34:16.900
we have a wash plant
that isn't running.

34:16.934 --> 34:19.000
At the Promised Land,

34:19.033 --> 34:22.000
wash plant Slucifer
is shut down

34:22.033 --> 34:24.934
with a broken water pump.

34:50.533 --> 34:51.567
What'd you do, Jordan?

34:54.934 --> 34:56.467
No

34:56.500 --> 34:57.934
I didn't expect you back
this fast.

34:57.967 --> 34:59.600
Alec can now just
swap the belts out.

34:59.634 --> 35:01.900
- Sounds good.
- And put her back on line.

35:01.934 --> 35:02.967
- Right on.
- Right on.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.667
- Thanks, man.
- No worries.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.033
Well, Jordan just flew in
in a helicopter

35:07.066 --> 35:09.100
with the parts for the pump.

35:09.133 --> 35:12.500
So, belt is $20,
delivery $2,000.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.567
Part of it's on, eh?

35:21.600 --> 35:23.700
Yeah. Just starting
to go into the grove there.

35:23.734 --> 35:26.166
Might get a little tough
but yeah, there she's going.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.400
There, how's that?

35:27.433 --> 35:29.133
- We got her.
- Nice.

35:29.166 --> 35:30.700
All clear and tight
on this side.

35:30.734 --> 35:32.266
- You happy, Jordan?
- Yeah.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.400
One side is all set and good.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.700
We'll be sluicing.

35:44.266 --> 35:45.500
You're the man, Jordan.

35:45.533 --> 35:48.467
After two
and a half hours of downtime.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.900
Give her Tater tots.

35:50.934 --> 35:54.500
Wash plant Slucifer
is back up and running.

35:54.533 --> 35:55.700
Got rocks.

35:55.734 --> 35:56.700
- Oh, yeah.
- Right here.

35:56.734 --> 35:57.934
Got lots of water.

35:57.967 --> 35:59.367
Chartering the helicopter

35:59.400 --> 36:01.734
cost Parker $2,000

36:01.767 --> 36:04.800
but reducing his downtime
by three hours

36:04.834 --> 36:08.467
has saved him over $10,000.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.767
- Right on, boys.
- Yeah.

36:09.800 --> 36:10.867
- We're sluicing.
- We're back sluicing.

36:24.333 --> 36:25.967
Well, it's what we like
to be doing right now.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.133
I'm out here pulling pay,

36:28.166 --> 36:30.600
getting it sent out
to the wash plant,

36:30.634 --> 36:32.800
going through the wash plant
and making us money.

36:33.967 --> 36:35.700
The plant is hungry
when it's running,

36:35.734 --> 36:38.433
so here to keep the beast fed.

36:40.100 --> 36:41.600
At California Creek,

36:41.634 --> 36:45.600
Fred is digging low grade pay
from his cut.

36:45.634 --> 36:48.567
To stay on track
for his season goal,

36:48.600 --> 36:50.400
his misfits crew

36:50.433 --> 36:53.133
needs to get three truckloads
of pay an hour

36:53.166 --> 36:56.300
to the Claytons' wash plant.

36:56.333 --> 36:57.734
We have no other choice

36:57.767 --> 37:01.600
but to simply just run
Fred's material right now,

37:01.634 --> 37:04.000
it's a lower concentration
of gold.

37:07.567 --> 37:09.800
For us to really do
really well this season,

37:09.834 --> 37:11.333
it's important for us
to get back down

37:11.367 --> 37:13.000
where the better gold is.

37:13.033 --> 37:15.300
I'm just lucky that
I was paired with Fred

37:15.333 --> 37:17.000
and we were able to actually
keep running.

37:19.233 --> 37:21.433
I'm pretty much the best
rock truck driver here,

37:21.467 --> 37:23.066
which is pretty sad
because the rock truck

37:23.100 --> 37:25.667
is pretty easy.

37:25.700 --> 37:27.667
Recently, we joined up
with the Claytons.

37:27.700 --> 37:29.734
It's kind of a risky move,

37:29.767 --> 37:31.433
a lot of their vehicles
go down

37:31.467 --> 37:34.533
and in all honesty,
I just don't see it

37:34.567 --> 37:36.166
panning out the way
Fred wants it to.

37:36.200 --> 37:38.500
With all the heavy rainfall
that we've been getting,

37:38.533 --> 37:40.700
Brandon's cut flooded completely

37:40.734 --> 37:44.200
so now we're only pulling pay
from our cut.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.433
Go, damn it, go.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.767
Bucket won't lift up.

38:03.967 --> 38:05.834
Sometimes you got to rev up
the engine

38:05.867 --> 38:06.967
to get it to start going

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
but right now
it's just not doing it.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.467
Well, I don't think
this is gonna get resolved

38:12.500 --> 38:13.634
anytime soon,

38:13.667 --> 38:16.100
uh, you guys are just wasting
film at this point.

38:19.033 --> 38:20.934
It's pretty
frustrating. Yeah.

38:21.734 --> 38:22.967
Hey, JB.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.433
Can you take a look
at the rock truck?

38:25.400 --> 38:26.934
Sure. What's wrong with it?

38:26.967 --> 38:28.333
No matter how much I rev

38:28.367 --> 38:29.300
the engine,

38:29.333 --> 38:30.900
the bucket wouldn't go up.

38:32.967 --> 38:36.433
Crew mechanic JB
fixed tanks in Iraq

38:36.467 --> 38:38.767
in the first Gulf War.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.600
Man, it looks like
some massive hydraulic leak

38:41.634 --> 38:44.367
underneath the hood there
from somewhere.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.200
It's so far underneath the cab

38:46.233 --> 38:47.700
and so hard to get to that it,

38:47.734 --> 38:50.300
uh, it's a pretty major fix.

38:50.333 --> 38:52.367
This could be the season
for that rock truck.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.400
Yeah, that's what
it could end up being,

38:54.433 --> 38:56.667
uh, it pretty much
might be done.

39:00.066 --> 39:01.367
Uh, he's gonna take it apart,

39:01.400 --> 39:03.033
we're gonna get
the part number,

39:03.066 --> 39:04.967
see if we can get
that part rushed,

39:05.000 --> 39:06.233
not what we needed.

39:07.367 --> 39:08.800
Oh, yeah, you got her.

39:13.266 --> 39:14.834
It's got a bad spot in it.

39:14.867 --> 39:16.400
- Right there.
- Yeah.

39:16.433 --> 39:18.333
We'll take this
to the auto parts store

39:18.367 --> 39:19.667
and they'll make a line
just like that

39:19.700 --> 39:21.700
and be done with it,
put it back in.

39:23.266 --> 39:24.934
JB heads to town

39:24.967 --> 39:26.233
to get the part he needs

39:26.266 --> 39:29.233
but it's a six-hour
round trip.

39:40.300 --> 39:41.667
We're down a rock truck

39:41.700 --> 39:44.533
and the pay pile is, uh,
looking pretty damn small.

39:44.567 --> 39:47.500
I probably have
35 buckets of pay

39:47.533 --> 39:49.066
before I run out.

39:49.100 --> 39:51.200
Right now, I'm running
a little bit slower

39:51.233 --> 39:52.533
to give them
a little more time.

39:52.567 --> 39:54.767
They need to pick up
the pace because, um,

39:54.800 --> 39:57.200
I don't wanna have
to shut this plant down.

39:58.333 --> 40:00.066
Looks like
Fred's fleet is basically

40:00.100 --> 40:01.333
falling apart on us.

40:01.367 --> 40:02.467
We're behind right now.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.400
Pay is not coming to the plant
as fast as we want it.

40:04.433 --> 40:06.166
We're trying to keep
Dirt Devil fed

40:06.200 --> 40:07.667
and it's just not working out.

40:14.166 --> 40:17.100
Eight hours after
Chris' rock truck broke down.

40:17.133 --> 40:20.700
I had to go to town
to get the hydraulic lines.

40:20.734 --> 40:24.333
JB is ready to test
the new hydraulic hose.

40:30.367 --> 40:31.667
We got smoke.

40:31.700 --> 40:33.400
Where there's smoke,
there's fire...

40:33.433 --> 40:35.934
It's been slowing us down.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.133
We need every vehicle we can,

40:38.166 --> 40:40.634
uh, so we got it up
and running,

40:40.667 --> 40:42.033
big, big relief.

40:42.066 --> 40:43.367
Big relief and, uh,

40:43.400 --> 40:44.900
we're ready to go pull
some more pay.

40:51.033 --> 40:53.233
We are taking all of our pay.

40:54.734 --> 40:57.734
Both rock trucks running,
full bore

40:57.767 --> 40:59.967
and taking the pay over here
to the big plant.

41:00.066 --> 41:02.000
Pretty exciting.

41:13.133 --> 41:15.367
You know, it looks like
we're stuck in the river.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.600
Ugh, you have gotta be
kidding me.

41:17.634 --> 41:19.266
It just died.

41:19.300 --> 41:22.000
Kruse's route
across Duncan Creek

41:22.033 --> 41:24.700
is blocked by the film crew.

41:24.734 --> 41:27.433
Hey, sorry about this, guys.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.700
Here we go.

41:48.367 --> 41:50.066
- Sorry about this, Kruse.
- Sorry, Kruse.

41:52.266 --> 41:54.133
Now we know
how the miners feel

41:54.166 --> 41:55.400
having cameras in their faces.

41:57.700 --> 42:00.066
Sorry man.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.767
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah. Here's your strap.

42:14.934 --> 42:16.033
What's up guys?

42:16.066 --> 42:17.533
- What's up?
- Hey.

42:17.567 --> 42:19.600
At California Creek,

42:19.634 --> 42:22.533
Brandon's high grade cut
flooded out,

42:22.567 --> 42:24.934
so the only gold
at this weigh in

42:24.967 --> 42:28.000
comes from Fred's
low grade pay dirt.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
We had a lot of problems
this last week,

42:31.033 --> 42:33.433
but it's not stuff we really
could have prevented.

42:33.467 --> 42:34.600
I mean, Brandon's creek overflowing.

42:34.634 --> 42:35.734
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

42:35.767 --> 42:36.867
What are we gonna do
about that?

42:36.900 --> 42:40.100
The equipment, uh, problems,
that's mining,

42:40.133 --> 42:43.066
so I feel like we're working
really well together.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.333
Yeah, I think so.

42:44.367 --> 42:47.033
So I guess it's time
to see what it is, huh?

42:47.066 --> 42:48.200
Fred's talking about it
too much.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.333
Let's put it on there.

42:49.367 --> 42:50.500
Yeah.
Let's put it on the plate.

42:50.533 --> 42:51.767
- Mmm-hmm. All right.
- All right, here we go.

42:51.800 --> 42:56.166
Fred and Brendan
will split the gold 50-50.

42:56.200 --> 42:59.700
One, two, three, four.

42:59.734 --> 43:02.834
To hit his
100-ounce season goal,

43:02.867 --> 43:06.967
Fred needs at least
9.4 ounces every week.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.867
13, 14, 15, 16...

43:10.634 --> 43:12.834
28, 30.

43:12.867 --> 43:15.266
30.865.

43:16.934 --> 43:20.767
Fred's share,
15.43 ounces

43:20.800 --> 43:23.767
worth $28,000.

43:23.800 --> 43:25.567
- Not bad, right?
- Not bad at all.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.900
I'm happy as a goat with this.

43:26.934 --> 43:30.333
I know it's less than
our last collaboration week

43:30.367 --> 43:33.133
but I think
this is a bigger victory.

43:33.166 --> 43:35.900
Because of all the
we had to fight to get this.

43:35.934 --> 43:37.734
I think we've already beat
the odds.

43:37.767 --> 43:39.200
Hell yeah, we have.

43:39.233 --> 43:42.567
Fred's total
stands at 87 ounces,

43:42.600 --> 43:46.433
13 short of his
100-ounce season goal.

43:46.467 --> 43:48.266
So we're knocking on that door
of our season...

43:48.300 --> 43:49.367
our season goal.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.500
We can get back out there

43:50.533 --> 43:52.433
and start washing
and hauling and...

43:52.467 --> 43:53.400
- Yeah.
- get us there.

43:53.433 --> 43:54.734
I think he means
like right now, guys, so.

43:55.867 --> 43:57.033
Okay.

44:12.266 --> 44:13.200
Richard.

44:13.233 --> 44:14.667
Oh, hello, guys.

44:14.700 --> 44:16.767
Brandon,
don't look so excited.

44:17.900 --> 44:19.066
I'm tired,
it's been a long week.

44:19.100 --> 44:20.500
Oh, I know.

44:20.533 --> 44:22.400
We still got
a big jar of gold though.

44:22.433 --> 44:24.734
It looks pretty hefty.

44:24.767 --> 44:27.266
Wow, that's...
What the heck is in there?

44:27.300 --> 44:29.834
Those are all your welding
rods from fixing that hole.

44:31.800 --> 44:32.967
Yeah. I feel kind of bad.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.400
You just get here, throw you
right in the hydraulic weld.

44:34.433 --> 44:36.266
I break it down
and he gets to fix it.

44:37.634 --> 44:39.533
So you're still happy
you came?

44:39.567 --> 44:41.700
Uh, I did not expect
to be working

44:41.734 --> 44:44.400
a 12-hour shift
the minute I got here.

44:45.433 --> 44:46.667
But, uh, you know,
I mean, it is what it is.

44:46.700 --> 44:47.734
- So...
- Yeah.

44:47.767 --> 44:49.567
Well, I knew you could
handle it, Dad.

44:49.600 --> 44:50.800
Well, I appreciate that, son.

44:53.867 --> 44:56.266
Well, should we see what
this week weighed out to?

44:56.300 --> 44:59.233
To reach his
2,000 ounce season goal,

44:59.266 --> 45:02.333
Rick must average
250 ounces a week.

45:03.700 --> 45:05.166
All right.
What do we got here?

45:07.433 --> 45:10.400
We got 30, 40, 70, 80.

45:10.433 --> 45:11.433
Nice.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.033
Wow, 120.

45:14.066 --> 45:16.133
Still coming...

45:17.400 --> 45:18.834
122.31.

45:18.867 --> 45:21.500
Worth $220,000,

45:21.533 --> 45:24.533
less than half
of what Rick needs.

45:24.567 --> 45:27.500
But the deeper into
the Rally Valley he goes,

45:27.533 --> 45:29.300
the better the gold.

45:29.333 --> 45:30.433
I know you guys
are getting tired

45:30.467 --> 45:31.967
but we've got some weeks left

45:32.000 --> 45:33.367
and I know you're all up
for it, right?

45:33.400 --> 45:35.700
I just wanna get to the bottom
of that now.

45:35.734 --> 45:37.100
They're gonna be bigger
and bigger, man.

45:37.133 --> 45:38.667
We're gonna need
two, three pans.

45:38.700 --> 45:40.567
Let's go double
this pan, boys.

45:40.600 --> 45:42.266
- I love it.
- Yeah.

45:42.300 --> 45:44.600
- Thanks a lot, guys.
- Yeah, you bet.

45:57.734 --> 45:58.834
Hey there, youngster.

45:58.867 --> 46:00.066
What's happening?

46:00.667 --> 46:01.700
How was your day?

46:01.734 --> 46:03.567
Oh, not too bad.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.567
I mean, I didn't have to
have a helicopter fly parts in

46:05.600 --> 46:08.333
for the water pump so...

46:08.367 --> 46:09.734
Don't get used to it, Tyson.

46:11.533 --> 46:12.700
You wanna see your Ugly Cut?

46:12.734 --> 46:14.000
You better take an ounce
out of there

46:14.033 --> 46:16.300
because it's going
to the helicopter company.

46:18.367 --> 46:19.734
First cleanup of the Ugly.

46:19.767 --> 46:22.033
The Promised Land's
other cuts,

46:22.066 --> 46:24.100
the Good and the Bad,

46:24.133 --> 46:26.834
averaged 200 ounces a week.

46:26.867 --> 46:29.700
Forty, sixty,

46:29.734 --> 46:30.834
eighty,

46:31.834 --> 46:33.166
a hundred.

46:34.133 --> 46:37.000
108.15.

46:37.033 --> 46:38.900
It's not bad
for a first cleanup.

46:38.934 --> 46:43.233
Worth almost $195,000

46:43.266 --> 46:45.900
but half the average
for the Promised Land.

46:45.934 --> 46:49.300
So Mitch, he had a smoking
week last week, right?

46:49.333 --> 46:51.400
Next up, Mud Mountain

46:51.433 --> 46:54.233
and Big Red where last week,

46:54.266 --> 46:56.200
Mitch hauled in
a season's best

46:56.233 --> 46:58.433
600 ounces of gold.

46:58.467 --> 47:00.634
Well, I got to know, Chris.
Did we beat it again?

47:00.667 --> 47:01.834
Well, I'll tell you what,

47:01.867 --> 47:04.100
you have another two-pan week.

47:08.567 --> 47:10.100
Is that yummy-looking or what?

47:10.133 --> 47:11.600
That looks very nice.

47:13.734 --> 47:14.934
So there is your 400.

47:14.967 --> 47:17.367
Okay.

47:17.400 --> 47:18.834
And you got another big
thermos out

47:18.867 --> 47:20.233
so I'm feeling pretty good.

47:20.266 --> 47:21.734
You wanna count this one,
Mitch?

47:22.967 --> 47:23.900
Here we go.

47:23.934 --> 47:24.900
Let's see what we got.

47:25.767 --> 47:29.333
Ten, thirty, forty.

47:29.367 --> 47:31.033
Oh, is that all you got
in there?

47:31.066 --> 47:33.200
45.45.

47:34.266 --> 47:35.266
Yeah.

47:35.300 --> 47:37.066
You know, you can't break
records every week, man.

47:37.100 --> 47:38.200
Well, I mean...

47:38.233 --> 47:40.400
So 445.45.

47:40.433 --> 47:44.033
Worth over $800,000.

47:44.066 --> 47:46.667
Four hundred and fifty ounces
in a week, man.

47:46.700 --> 47:48.300
- Yeah.
- You really can't complain.

47:48.333 --> 47:49.467
Yeah, you can.

47:52.500 --> 47:53.500
So you guys, for the season,

47:53.533 --> 47:57.000
it's 6657.85.

47:57.033 --> 47:59.333
We're gaining on last season.

47:59.367 --> 48:00.433
That's good.

48:00.467 --> 48:01.634
All right.
Well, let's finish strong.

48:01.667 --> 48:03.100
- Let's do it.
- Cheers.
