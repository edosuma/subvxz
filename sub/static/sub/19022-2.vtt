00:04.724 --> 00:06.957
The United States has been
fighting a war against terror

00:06.959 --> 00:08.092
for 15 years.

00:10.130 --> 00:12.463
SEAL Team Six and other
Special Operations forces

00:12.465 --> 00:15.400
have been deployed for 5,400 days.

00:17.137 --> 00:19.604
It is the longest war
in American history.

00:19.606 --> 00:21.005
Knock it out!

00:22.842 --> 00:26.043
Terror attacks all over the world

00:26.045 --> 00:27.912
are at an all-time high.

00:31.484 --> 00:32.950
Muttaqi did this.

00:32.952 --> 00:35.820
He's hiding in a village in Kunar.

00:35.822 --> 00:39.123
Command wants us to take a shot tonight.

00:39.125 --> 00:40.458
Check this out.

00:40.460 --> 00:41.592
Goddamn savages.

00:41.594 --> 00:43.261
Wait! Wait! I'm American!

00:43.263 --> 00:45.029
I want to go home.

00:45.031 --> 00:46.364
No!

00:46.366 --> 00:48.299
He surrendered. He was an American.

00:48.301 --> 00:49.767
He was a threat.

00:49.769 --> 00:53.137
Been almost a year. We have to move on.

00:53.139 --> 00:54.436
If you don't get
current on your payments,

00:54.460 --> 00:55.822
it's called contempt of court.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.596
This man's your father, in
case you don't recognize him.

00:57.598 --> 00:58.609
I'm getting out.

00:58.611 --> 00:59.834
Can't just quit on us.

00:59.859 --> 01:01.333
I'll make sure the new
guy's ready to roll.

01:01.335 --> 01:02.947
You do know our names, don't you?

01:02.949 --> 01:04.147
This is the new guy scene,

01:04.150 --> 01:05.370
where you guys give me shit, right?

01:05.373 --> 01:07.385
Take the girls inside... Now!

01:11.124 --> 01:14.392
24 hours ago, armed men
assaulted a girls school

01:14.394 --> 01:17.328
80 miles northwest of
Benin City, Nigeria.

01:17.330 --> 01:18.696
Hostages were taken.

01:18.698 --> 01:20.198
They also captured Richard Taggart,

01:20.200 --> 01:22.233
former troop chief at this command.

01:23.336 --> 01:25.636
- Let him go, Bear.
- He's there because of you.

01:25.638 --> 01:27.972
Hey. We're gonna fix this,
because that's what we do.

01:27.974 --> 01:29.474
It's just till we get Rip back.

01:29.476 --> 01:30.675
Come home to me, Ricky.

01:30.677 --> 01:32.109
I always do.

01:34.747 --> 01:35.813
Who's that?

01:39.118 --> 01:41.419
That's the man who killed my brother.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.103 --> 01:59.136
Hey, Delta Echo, bring it in.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.693
_

02:01.908 --> 02:04.775
HVT is Ebo Buhari.

02:04.777 --> 02:07.044
Been running as a courier
for Boko Haram and ISIL

02:07.046 --> 02:08.713
these past few months.

02:08.715 --> 02:10.448
He knows where Rip is.

02:10.449 --> 02:13.618
He's been operating out of
a cargo ship in Lagos Harbor.

02:13.620 --> 02:16.454
He will have guards,
and they will be armed.

02:16.456 --> 02:19.790
All right, ISR shows a
periodic stationary sentry here,

02:19.792 --> 02:21.759
an irregular roving patrol here,

02:21.761 --> 02:24.028
so we board at the portside stern.

02:24.030 --> 02:26.030
Hook and climb two
ladders, own a footprint,

02:26.032 --> 02:27.098
secure the deck.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.466
Point man.

02:28.468 --> 02:29.767
Fishbait.

02:31.137 --> 02:33.304
Your element secures the high ground

02:33.306 --> 02:34.972
and sets up an overwatch.

02:34.974 --> 02:39.076
I will take my element down
one deck to this area over here,

02:39.078 --> 02:41.879
start knocking on doors,
and hope that our guy's home.

02:41.881 --> 02:43.614
Breacher.

02:43.616 --> 02:46.784
Based on the sister ship study,
we focus on the cabin doors,

02:46.786 --> 02:48.753
take a standard load-out for VBSS.

02:48.755 --> 02:50.709
We want to get through
something, we'll get through it.

02:50.711 --> 02:51.989
Why is he talking?

02:51.991 --> 02:53.958
Chase is the lead breacher on this op.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.393
I'm just assist.

02:55.395 --> 02:57.595
No, he can learn on
another op. You take it.

02:57.597 --> 02:59.063
Okay.

02:59.065 --> 03:00.398
What he said.

03:05.305 --> 03:08.272
Once we have the HVT
and the target is secure,

03:08.274 --> 03:09.407
we commence SSE.

03:09.409 --> 03:11.509
Bag everything for intel.

03:11.511 --> 03:12.977
New guy, that's your job.

03:12.979 --> 03:15.346
We have two minutes to get what we need.

03:15.348 --> 03:18.849
After that, Delta and Echo units
link up here at the hook point.

03:18.851 --> 03:20.618
Then we call the extract birds.

03:20.620 --> 03:22.086
If everything goes as planned...

03:22.088 --> 03:23.854
Which, as we know, it always does.

03:23.856 --> 03:25.256
Now they know who Rip is,

03:25.258 --> 03:26.588
there's no telling what they might do,

03:26.612 --> 03:28.681
so it's up to us to get
there before they do it.

03:28.683 --> 03:30.361
This guy gets us there.

03:30.363 --> 03:33.998
We get in, we get out, we
ask for forgiveness later.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.034
We cannot and will not dick this up.

04:11.906 --> 04:13.032
_

04:13.555 --> 04:16.213
_

04:17.877 --> 04:18.909
Special soldier!

04:18.911 --> 04:21.144
More of you come?

04:21.147 --> 04:22.747
Come for you?

04:28.209 --> 04:29.835
_

04:29.956 --> 04:31.496
_

04:31.581 --> 04:32.718
_

04:33.027 --> 04:34.633
_

04:35.197 --> 04:36.605
_

04:36.982 --> 04:38.383
_

04:47.507 --> 04:49.740
Michael? Some assistance.

04:51.544 --> 04:52.710
Talk to me.

04:52.712 --> 04:55.613
Marissa Wyatt, Oregon, 17 years old,

04:55.615 --> 04:57.081
three months in development.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.737
Her grandmother's telling
her to cut contact.

04:58.739 --> 05:01.018
Where are you in the script?

05:01.020 --> 05:02.853
The script isn't working.

05:02.855 --> 05:04.555
Well, you make it work.

05:04.557 --> 05:05.923
Give me a lead.

05:05.925 --> 05:07.377
She likes soccer, but she can't play.

05:07.379 --> 05:08.626
She's asthmatic.

05:08.628 --> 05:11.062
She wants to be part of a team.

05:11.064 --> 05:12.063
That's in the script.

05:12.065 --> 05:13.898
So? What do you sell?

05:13.900 --> 05:16.534
Camaraderie, purpose,
opportunity for leadership.

05:16.536 --> 05:19.704
Family, dude. Always
bring it back to family.

05:19.706 --> 05:20.971
What else?

05:20.973 --> 05:22.640
We set up her own Twitter account,

05:22.642 --> 05:23.808
make her feel important.

05:23.810 --> 05:25.643
We're ready.

05:25.645 --> 05:28.079
Muttaqi's on the game.

05:28.081 --> 05:31.148
Look at all these selfies.

05:31.150 --> 05:34.251
Tell you what... send
her an Alex Morgan jersey,

05:34.253 --> 05:36.153
a Nikon DSLR.

05:36.155 --> 05:38.055
And don't worry about Grandma.

05:38.057 --> 05:40.057
She's not gonna be an issue.

05:45.231 --> 05:46.230
You've seen the news?

05:46.232 --> 05:47.683
Of course.

05:47.708 --> 05:50.601
Everyone here is very
pleased with the embassy.

05:50.603 --> 05:52.336
Are you prepared for the next phase?

05:52.338 --> 05:54.905
I'm talking about the
American soldier...

05:54.907 --> 05:56.348
The one Boko Haram picked up.

05:56.373 --> 05:57.648
_

05:57.673 --> 05:58.738
I want him.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.598
_

06:01.013 --> 06:02.513
This will be bigger than that.

06:02.547 --> 06:05.361
_

06:06.486 --> 06:08.252
What did he say?

06:11.548 --> 06:12.814
He says we're on.

06:23.603 --> 06:25.636
What's gonna happen to us?

06:25.638 --> 06:27.938
Somebody answer me.

06:27.940 --> 06:30.174
You're the security guy.

06:30.176 --> 06:32.109
You can do something, right?

06:32.111 --> 06:35.146
He's a drunk. He is no help to us.

06:35.148 --> 06:37.548
Tell it to us straight.

06:37.550 --> 06:39.283
What are we dealing with here?

06:39.285 --> 06:40.885
You don't want to know.

06:40.887 --> 06:42.686
We will be dead in a week.

06:42.688 --> 06:43.821
Jesus Christ.

06:43.823 --> 06:45.456
The women and girls...

06:45.458 --> 06:48.692
They will wish they
had never lived at all.

06:48.811 --> 06:50.119
_

06:52.999 --> 06:56.233
Those men outside... They saw you on TV.

06:56.235 --> 06:58.569
They said you had special skills.

06:58.594 --> 07:01.042
You were right the first
time. I can't help you.

07:02.175 --> 07:05.543
Okay, let's, uh...
let's think about this.

07:05.545 --> 07:08.212
If he's on TV, then so are we.

07:08.214 --> 07:11.415
They're probably negotiating
our release right now.

07:11.417 --> 07:13.918
They have a price they're asking, right?

07:13.920 --> 07:15.319
So my company will pay it.

07:15.321 --> 07:17.254
We just have to wait until they do.

07:17.256 --> 07:18.823
Who is going to pay for them?

07:18.825 --> 07:20.191
They'll pay for all of us.

07:20.193 --> 07:22.359
That's bullshit.

07:22.361 --> 07:24.895
They're on their own, and you know it.

07:24.897 --> 07:25.896
Is this true?

07:25.898 --> 07:27.531
No. It's not true.

07:27.533 --> 07:29.233
I need you to be more positive.

07:29.235 --> 07:31.235
I don't work for you anymore,

07:31.237 --> 07:33.504
so what you need isn't my problem.

07:33.506 --> 07:36.807
I'm not going to let anything
else happen to my girls.

07:36.809 --> 07:42.346
And if any of you have a speck
of humanity in your hearts,

07:42.348 --> 07:44.315
neither will you.

07:47.211 --> 07:49.778
Lady, heart ain't got
anything to do with it.

08:12.192 --> 08:17.054
_

08:33.466 --> 08:35.099
That's it.

08:35.101 --> 08:37.301
What do you say, Team Leader?

08:37.303 --> 08:39.068
Let's take it down.

09:57.966 --> 10:01.067
Delta 1 making entry. On the clock.

11:05.225 --> 11:07.937
_

11:07.962 --> 11:09.246
_

11:25.420 --> 11:27.554
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

11:38.700 --> 11:39.933
It's him.

11:39.935 --> 11:41.568
Great. Let's pack it up and go.

11:43.296 --> 11:45.705
All stations, this is Delta 1.

11:45.707 --> 11:48.460
Jackpot. I say again... jackpot.

11:57.886 --> 11:59.953
Hey. Where's this man?

11:59.955 --> 12:02.455
It's been two minutes, Bear.
Now let's get off the X.

12:02.457 --> 12:05.358
I'm gonna ask you
again... Where's this man?!

12:05.360 --> 12:07.060
Let it go. They'll debrief him later.

12:07.062 --> 12:09.129
By the grace of Allah, in the ground.

12:21.309 --> 12:22.742
Where is he?

12:22.744 --> 12:23.977
Where is he?

12:23.979 --> 12:26.246
I don't know!

12:26.248 --> 12:28.681
Bullshit! You know!

12:28.683 --> 12:30.216
Let's go!

12:30.218 --> 12:32.252
Where is he?!

12:32.254 --> 12:34.621
Bear, let's roll!

12:41.963 --> 12:43.930
I'm in!

12:46.501 --> 12:47.567
Grenade!

12:49.934 --> 12:51.437
Jesus! What the hell?

12:51.439 --> 12:52.727
Are you hit?

12:52.729 --> 12:56.242
No, no. I'm good. I'm good!

13:06.454 --> 13:08.688
Help! Help!!

13:08.690 --> 13:10.390
Shut up! Caulder, get us out of here.

13:10.392 --> 13:11.724
Oh, so now you're in a hurry.

13:11.726 --> 13:13.226
- This way!
- That you guys?

13:13.228 --> 13:14.615
Roger that. We're
engaging multiple targets.

13:14.617 --> 13:16.262
We're moving out.

13:16.264 --> 13:17.897
They heard the blast.
Get up here... now!

13:17.899 --> 13:18.932
Working on it.

13:18.934 --> 13:20.633
On me!

13:43.658 --> 13:47.093
Any stations on this
net, this is Delta 1.

13:47.095 --> 13:48.094
Radio check.

13:48.096 --> 13:49.629
Foxtrot 2-2 copies.

13:49.631 --> 13:51.998
Be advised, helos are two minutes out.

13:59.007 --> 14:00.173
What the hell, Caulder?

14:00.175 --> 14:01.741
It's cool. We go through it.

14:01.743 --> 14:03.376
- Breacher.
- Got it.

14:11.086 --> 14:12.185
Going explosive.

14:12.187 --> 14:13.186
In here?

14:13.188 --> 14:14.254
Yeah.

14:14.256 --> 14:15.822
No.

14:15.824 --> 14:18.091
Chase, roll out.

14:18.093 --> 14:19.425
We're cutting through.

14:22.864 --> 14:24.397
Get the hoolie ready.

14:40.148 --> 14:42.882
Delta 1, Foxtrot 2-2,
helos are on station.

14:42.884 --> 14:44.017
Anytime.

14:49.624 --> 14:50.790
You're up.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.146
_

14:52.398 --> 14:53.970
_

14:55.063 --> 14:56.729
Move him! Move!

15:00.168 --> 15:01.434
Let's go, Chase.

15:05.840 --> 15:06.839
Ready?

15:10.145 --> 15:11.844
Come on!

15:11.846 --> 15:13.579
- Open!
- On me!

15:13.581 --> 15:15.315
We're at the portside aft ladders.

15:15.317 --> 15:18.651
Going external on the main deck.

15:18.653 --> 15:20.219
Move!

15:20.221 --> 15:23.222
Delta 1, Delta 4, we have your position.

15:23.224 --> 15:25.325
We have your egress covered.

15:39.007 --> 15:40.606
All right, come on, come on, come on.

15:44.079 --> 15:45.678
They're on the dock!

15:59.861 --> 16:01.284
- One.
- Last man!

16:01.930 --> 16:02.929
Two.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.866
Three.

16:06.868 --> 16:08.568
Four.

16:10.939 --> 16:12.872
Five. Six.

16:22.918 --> 16:24.484
It was a judgment call.

16:24.486 --> 16:26.853
Yeah, a bad one. The
risk-reward ratio was way off.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.255
The reward was on the ship.

16:28.257 --> 16:29.744
The guy might've told us where Rip was.

16:29.746 --> 16:31.658
By now, he's had a chance to clam up.

16:31.660 --> 16:33.748
Maybe yes, maybe no, but there's a
right and a wrong way to do things.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.817
And you decide what's right and
what's wrong? It's what you do?

16:35.819 --> 16:37.564
What I don't do is drag out a B.I.,

16:37.566 --> 16:40.233
getting us into a gunfight
that could have been avoided.

16:41.370 --> 16:43.403
Do you want to save Rip or don't you?

16:44.707 --> 16:47.841
All right, you can ask that once.

16:47.843 --> 16:49.376
But what I'm wondering...

16:49.378 --> 16:51.433
And, Buddha, you can let me
know if I'm way off here...

16:51.435 --> 16:54.514
Is, maybe you want to save Rip too much.

16:57.620 --> 17:00.320
I asked that man to be the
godfather to my daughter.

17:00.322 --> 17:01.788
Do you remember that?

17:01.790 --> 17:03.557
'Cause you were there, and so were you.

17:03.559 --> 17:06.393
- Okay, Bear...
- You better believe that it is personal.

17:06.395 --> 17:08.762
It is about as personal as it gets.

17:11.453 --> 17:14.201
You know...

17:14.203 --> 17:16.269
it must be great...

17:16.271 --> 17:18.739
Not feeling anything for anybody.

17:22.810 --> 17:24.711
Hey, Bear. Come on.

17:30.486 --> 17:32.753
I'm feeling something right now.

17:34.690 --> 17:36.256
You're awfully quiet.

17:36.258 --> 17:39.259
'Course, I would be, too,
if I had to go face Jackie.

17:39.261 --> 17:42.162
This is some deep shit
for Bear. You know it.

17:42.164 --> 17:43.430
I know it is.

17:43.432 --> 17:45.432
But he pushed it too hard on that op.

17:45.434 --> 17:48.702
We lost the initiative. We
got behind the eight-ball.

17:48.704 --> 17:50.370
We can't let that happen again.

17:50.372 --> 17:51.772
Better not.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.941
- Hey, just so you know...
- Mm-hmm?

17:54.943 --> 17:58.178
In my family, I am el jefe, okay?

17:59.002 --> 18:00.468
Sure you are.

18:07.623 --> 18:09.523
I don't even believe it when I say it.

18:15.175 --> 18:16.741
Monita, I'm home.

18:19.980 --> 18:21.680
Hey, RJ.

18:21.682 --> 18:23.215
What's up, buddy?

18:23.217 --> 18:24.382
Hey.

18:29.156 --> 18:31.022
Uh, so, uh...

18:31.024 --> 18:33.425
did you pass that thing where the, um...

18:33.427 --> 18:34.759
Yep.

18:34.761 --> 18:36.394
Cool.

18:36.396 --> 18:37.429
Is Mom home?

18:37.431 --> 18:39.498
Think she went out.

18:40.834 --> 18:42.400
It's Career Day at school tomorrow.

18:42.402 --> 18:44.569
Everybody's dad's gonna be there.

18:46.006 --> 18:49.207
Yeah. We can't talk about what I do.

18:49.209 --> 18:50.577
You know that, right?

18:52.071 --> 18:53.838
Maybe next year?

18:55.015 --> 18:56.114
Yeah, sure.

18:56.116 --> 18:57.449
Yeah.

18:57.451 --> 18:59.817
Hey, you know where Mom keeps the Advil?

18:59.819 --> 19:00.852
Bathroom, maybe?

19:00.854 --> 19:02.287
Good call.

19:10.731 --> 19:12.564
Don't be a brat, RJ.

19:12.566 --> 19:15.033
It's Papa. I'm home.

19:15.035 --> 19:16.234
Come back later.

19:16.236 --> 19:18.853
What?! I want to see you. Open up.

19:18.878 --> 19:20.110
Come on.

19:21.575 --> 19:22.807
Hey.

19:22.809 --> 19:23.909
How you doing?

19:23.911 --> 19:25.443
Homework.

19:25.445 --> 19:26.778
I mean, fine.

19:26.780 --> 19:27.913
Give me a hug.

19:27.915 --> 19:29.948
Come on. What's up?

19:31.489 --> 19:32.988
We weren't doing anything.

19:35.422 --> 19:36.587
Dad.

19:36.589 --> 19:38.089
I want you to know, Mr. Ortiz,

19:38.091 --> 19:39.907
that I respect your
daughter as... as a woman.

19:39.909 --> 19:41.326
Oh, for Christ's sake.

19:41.328 --> 19:42.727
Come back in 10 years.

19:42.729 --> 19:44.050
I can't believe you just did that.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.664
- Where's your mother?
- Working, okay?

19:45.666 --> 19:47.999
God, I hate you! You're
ruining everything!

19:48.001 --> 19:49.296
No, no, no. Wait, you can't...

20:35.983 --> 20:37.449
How was it?

20:37.451 --> 20:38.450
Good.

20:38.452 --> 20:39.618
We all got back.

20:39.620 --> 20:41.586
You ready?

20:48.795 --> 20:49.828
Nice shot.

20:49.830 --> 20:51.229
Thank you.

20:51.231 --> 20:53.665
Hey, Beermeister.
Thought you didn't drink.

20:53.667 --> 20:56.167
Yeah, well, you damn
frogmen drove me to it.

20:57.571 --> 20:58.870
That happens.

20:58.872 --> 21:01.973
Skipper says the beer lamp is lit.

21:01.975 --> 21:03.808
Thank you.

21:05.345 --> 21:06.678
What do we got?

21:06.680 --> 21:07.979
A little Jose.

21:07.981 --> 21:09.447
Yeah, my middle name.

21:11.685 --> 21:12.817
There you go.

21:12.819 --> 21:14.653
Yeah, buddy.

21:14.655 --> 21:19.524
The fewer, the prouder, the braver.

21:19.526 --> 21:20.592
Salud.

21:20.594 --> 21:22.093
Mm.

21:22.095 --> 21:23.895
You want one, Buck?

21:23.897 --> 21:25.096
Nah, I'm good.

21:25.098 --> 21:26.898
Whoa, Buck, you don't want a shot?

21:26.923 --> 21:28.978
Come on, man. You need to stop
doing this shit in the bar.

21:28.980 --> 21:31.259
Jerk off in your cave.

21:33.206 --> 21:35.874
I think Babydoll might
be cheating on me.

21:35.876 --> 21:36.908
Hope not.

21:36.910 --> 21:38.443
Are you kidding me?

21:38.445 --> 21:40.211
You're spying on your wife.

21:40.213 --> 21:41.780
Yeah, I am.

21:41.782 --> 21:43.615
You have heard of
couples therapy, right?

21:43.617 --> 21:45.283
Ain't nobody got no time for that.

21:45.285 --> 21:47.786
Hey, Buck,
can you send me that link?

21:47.788 --> 21:48.787
Dick.

21:50.090 --> 21:51.823
No, I'm serious. Send me the link.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.914
What actually happened
to Senior Chief Taggart?

21:58.598 --> 22:00.932
Above my pay grade, bro.

22:09.242 --> 22:11.576
What are you looking at?

22:11.578 --> 22:13.712
I'm counting the guards.

22:13.714 --> 22:16.715
There are five guards.

22:16.717 --> 22:18.616
Maybe 15 shooters.

22:18.618 --> 22:20.952
I heard them talking.

22:20.954 --> 22:23.388
They're afraid of you.

22:23.390 --> 22:26.891
When their leader comes,
they will kill you.

22:26.893 --> 22:29.461
Yeah, well, shit happens.

22:32.966 --> 22:36.501
Do you know what Boko
Haram does to girls?

22:36.503 --> 22:38.636
They will sell them as slaves,

22:38.638 --> 22:41.506
and they'll be raped by
their so-called husbands,

22:41.508 --> 22:42.841
forced into motherhood

22:42.843 --> 22:46.644
before they can even
be children themselves.

22:46.646 --> 22:49.180
Their own families will shun them.

22:49.182 --> 22:51.449
They will be turned away as outcasts,

22:51.451 --> 22:55.086
and they won't ever be
able to go home again.

22:55.088 --> 22:56.855
Look at them.

22:56.857 --> 22:58.356
Can you imagine what that...

22:58.358 --> 23:00.458
Like I said, shit happens.

23:00.460 --> 23:03.628
Nothing anybody can do about it.

23:03.630 --> 23:05.930
Please.

23:05.932 --> 23:09.934
They don't have much, but I
can put something together.

23:09.936 --> 23:11.136
We can pay you.

23:11.138 --> 23:13.271
You work for money, don't you?

23:13.273 --> 23:14.405
Mister?

23:18.145 --> 23:20.311
It's true what you say, isn't it?

23:20.313 --> 23:22.514
They won't pay for us.

23:22.516 --> 23:25.517
Bertina... That's my sister...

23:25.519 --> 23:29.120
She doesn't know how to feed my bird.

23:29.122 --> 23:31.356
If I am not there, who will feed him?

23:31.358 --> 23:32.891
Did you put her up to this?

23:32.893 --> 23:34.058
No.

23:34.060 --> 23:37.529
The seeds are in a tin under my bed.

23:37.531 --> 23:40.231
Can you tell her I said that?

23:50.644 --> 23:52.911
Esther.

23:52.913 --> 23:56.014
Her name is Esther.

23:56.016 --> 23:57.415
She's a Christian.

23:57.417 --> 24:00.018
Some of the others are Muslim.

24:00.020 --> 24:01.586
But neither God nor Allah

24:01.588 --> 24:02.909
- will save them unless...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:02.911 --> 24:04.122
Okay, okay.

24:04.124 --> 24:05.256
Okay.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.714
$25,000.

24:20.716 --> 24:22.916
For the
first attempt, yes.

24:22.918 --> 24:24.284
If payment is a concern,

24:24.286 --> 24:26.319
we offer credit with excellent terms.

24:26.321 --> 24:27.487
That's IVF.

24:27.489 --> 24:29.422
We're gonna start smaller, right?

24:29.424 --> 24:31.558
Yes, we typically
begin with Clomid to see

24:31.560 --> 24:33.927
if we can stimulate
ovulation and go from there.

24:33.929 --> 24:35.328
And that's...

24:35.330 --> 24:37.497
Inexpensive... Maybe $50.

24:40.215 --> 24:45.199
Is there anything else that
she can try, um, at home?

24:45.224 --> 24:46.523
You know, naturally?

24:46.548 --> 24:50.076
Well, given her age and past history,

24:50.078 --> 24:51.578
it's not surprising

24:51.580 --> 24:53.446
that your wife is having
trouble conceiving.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.248
I'd like to do a physical exam

24:55.250 --> 24:57.484
to check for any cervical irregularities

24:57.486 --> 24:59.252
and draw blood for labs.

25:00.135 --> 25:02.669
We should also get a semen sample.

25:02.671 --> 25:03.670
Why?

25:03.672 --> 25:05.138
Joseph.

25:05.140 --> 25:08.108
The more information
we have, the better.

25:08.110 --> 25:10.944
All right. Okay.

25:16.686 --> 25:17.719
Now?

25:21.523 --> 25:23.824
Fine.

25:26.695 --> 25:29.196
Ohh!

25:59.762 --> 26:00.894
Of course.

26:12.541 --> 26:14.441
I'm f... I'm fine.

26:14.443 --> 26:15.942
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:15.944 --> 26:17.477
It's me.

26:21.350 --> 26:23.216
Did you already do it?

26:23.218 --> 26:24.918
Look, I-I think that we should just,

26:24.920 --> 26:26.720
you know, come back another day.

26:26.722 --> 26:27.788
Oh, my God.

26:27.790 --> 26:29.589
- Is that a VCR?
- Yeah.

26:29.591 --> 26:30.757
Uh, no. Don't...

26:35.297 --> 26:36.730
Wow.

26:36.732 --> 26:38.865
Her boobs are so big.

26:38.867 --> 26:40.600
How does she even run?

26:40.602 --> 26:42.856
I don't think that's a big priority.

26:44.552 --> 26:45.551
Hmm.

26:45.576 --> 26:46.842
Mm.

27:01.290 --> 27:03.490
The last time we watched
an actual porn film

27:03.492 --> 27:05.425
was in high school.

27:05.427 --> 27:07.828
Remember that?

27:07.830 --> 27:09.029
On the church trip.

27:09.031 --> 27:10.163
Mm-hmm.

27:16.171 --> 27:17.237
Mm?

27:17.239 --> 27:18.905
Mm!

27:25.147 --> 27:26.146
Mm!

27:26.148 --> 27:28.315
My big Bear.

27:33.522 --> 27:35.922
Lena, I just...

27:35.924 --> 27:37.324
What?

27:37.326 --> 27:39.793
Do you want me to stop?

27:39.795 --> 27:41.595
Don't you dare.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.665
Shh!

27:45.667 --> 27:47.701
You "Shh."

27:49.104 --> 27:50.303
Okay. Get the cup.

27:50.305 --> 27:51.438
Get the cup!

27:51.440 --> 27:52.873
Get the cup!

28:01.283 --> 28:03.016
Oh, Jesus Christ!

28:03.018 --> 28:04.785
What was that?

28:04.787 --> 28:08.588
Two essences melding together
in a single fleeting moment.

28:12.728 --> 28:14.728
Don't ruin it, hon.

28:16.632 --> 28:18.465
I still get my French toast, right?

28:18.467 --> 28:23.637
You can order anything
off my menu anytime.

29:45.921 --> 29:47.420
Alex.

30:10.279 --> 30:12.512
Hey! You're home.

30:12.514 --> 30:14.681
You're the only one
that noticed I was gone.

30:16.183 --> 30:17.148
Mm.

30:19.821 --> 30:22.022
Mi rey, I would have made you something.

30:22.024 --> 30:23.356
It's okay. I'm fine.

30:23.358 --> 30:25.358
How'd it go?

30:25.360 --> 30:27.661
Good. We got the target we wanted.

30:27.663 --> 30:29.029
Now let's see what he says.

30:29.031 --> 30:31.431
And the new guy? What's his name?

30:31.433 --> 30:33.767
Chase? Oh, he's getting there.

30:33.769 --> 30:35.335
Well, he's lucky to have you.

30:35.337 --> 30:37.091
You know, we should
invite him over for dinner,

30:37.093 --> 30:38.838
like Rip did for you.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.407
Yeah, we should.

30:40.409 --> 30:42.375
Hey, where were you?

30:44.880 --> 30:47.213
I was working.

30:47.215 --> 30:49.382
You fill in somewhere,
like a temp or something?

30:49.384 --> 30:51.017
No.

30:51.019 --> 30:53.887
Mi amor, uh... listen.

30:53.889 --> 30:57.624
The drug company that I used
to work for before Anabel?

30:57.626 --> 30:59.359
They had a sales opening.

30:59.361 --> 31:03.196
If I work nights and
weekends, it might be enough.

31:03.198 --> 31:05.332
Hey, hey, hey. Nights and weekends?

31:05.334 --> 31:07.701
What about the kids? They need you here.

31:07.703 --> 31:10.637
If we need the extra
help, we can ask my mom.

31:10.639 --> 31:11.871
Your mother? Here?

31:11.873 --> 31:13.907
Why don't you kill me first?

31:13.909 --> 31:15.875
Hey, that contracting job...

31:15.877 --> 31:18.311
Once we have Rip, I'll take it, okay?

31:18.313 --> 31:19.346
It's all gonna be fine.

31:19.348 --> 31:20.480
Ricky.

31:20.482 --> 31:22.015
You're living in a dreamland.

31:22.017 --> 31:24.384
We need the deposit for Anabel now.

31:24.386 --> 31:27.187
If we want this for her, then
this is how it's gonna be.

31:27.189 --> 31:29.243
You know what your daughter
was doing while you were gone?

31:29.245 --> 31:32.192
She was in her room with a
boy and the door was locked.

31:32.194 --> 31:33.936
Can we talk about this later?

31:34.830 --> 31:36.172
Give me that. Go brush your teeth.

31:36.174 --> 31:37.485
Hey, I think we should really ta...

31:38.734 --> 31:40.033
- What is it, baby?
- Nada, nada.

31:40.035 --> 31:41.101
- Is it your knee?
- No.

31:41.103 --> 31:42.769
- Let me see it.
- I'm fine.

31:42.771 --> 31:44.437
Let me see it.

31:47.943 --> 31:49.009
Whoa!

31:49.011 --> 31:50.410
Can you bend it?

31:50.412 --> 31:52.012
Yes, of course I can.

31:52.014 --> 31:53.246
Feels hot.

31:53.248 --> 31:54.554
That's because I ran out of peas.

31:54.556 --> 31:56.383
- Anabel!
- What?

31:56.385 --> 31:58.373
Get the keys to the van. We're
taking your dad to the hospital.

31:58.375 --> 31:59.614
Why? What happened?

31:59.639 --> 32:01.409
Nothing. I'm fine. Hey,
you're overreacting.

32:01.411 --> 32:02.231
Can I drive?

32:02.256 --> 32:04.112
No. You can't drive. RJ, you stay here.

32:04.114 --> 32:05.392
No way! I'm coming, too!

32:05.394 --> 32:06.714
We're going to the hospital at Sandhill.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.194
Hey, hey! Stop! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:08.196 --> 32:10.096
Hey. I'm fine.

32:10.098 --> 32:12.232
I can go to our clinic tomorrow, okay?

32:12.234 --> 32:15.235
They'll give me a shot
of cortisone or something.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.369
Please.

32:16.371 --> 32:18.071
Just... Just come and sit

32:18.073 --> 32:21.775
and we can spend some time
together as a family, okay?

32:23.078 --> 32:24.110
Ricky.

32:25.747 --> 32:26.880
Get in the van.

32:26.882 --> 32:28.048
Shotgun!

32:39.161 --> 32:41.728
Everybody in position?

32:43.298 --> 32:44.731
Make it happen.

33:03.852 --> 33:05.552
It's taken care of.

33:05.577 --> 33:09.066
_

33:09.091 --> 33:10.457
Allahu Akbar.

33:10.459 --> 33:11.624
Allahu Akbar.

33:11.626 --> 33:13.159
I'm going to get the SEAL.

33:13.161 --> 33:14.694
Not without approval.

33:14.696 --> 33:16.863
He is a distraction from your mission.

33:16.865 --> 33:19.132
This is Boko Haram we're talking about.

33:19.134 --> 33:22.702
They're gonna wrap this guy
in Goodyears and torch him.

33:22.704 --> 33:25.772
With all respect, he's
important for our cause.

33:25.774 --> 33:28.875
Respect is real when given
without hope for reward.

33:28.877 --> 33:30.977
Meet me in Qatar in two days.

33:45.326 --> 33:48.193
How did you find out where I lived?

33:48.195 --> 33:50.329
Court records, Alex. They're public.

33:50.331 --> 33:51.363
Did you make this?

33:51.365 --> 33:52.364
Yes, I made it.

33:52.366 --> 33:53.499
Where is your mother?

33:53.501 --> 33:54.500
Like I would know.

33:54.502 --> 33:55.801
You could call Brad,

33:55.803 --> 33:58.504
but he says you're a war criminal.

33:58.506 --> 34:00.706
A what?

34:00.708 --> 34:03.309
He uses the N-word a lot.

34:03.311 --> 34:04.543
He does know I'm white?

34:04.545 --> 34:06.345
"Nazi."

34:06.347 --> 34:09.181
You know, you do atrocities
like kill women and children.

34:09.183 --> 34:11.083
Is that what you think of me?

34:11.085 --> 34:13.072
No, I just don't think of you.

34:14.822 --> 34:17.156
Okay. Just because I'm
your father doesn't...

34:17.158 --> 34:19.525
Look, you know this isn't cool, right?

34:19.527 --> 34:21.181
Showing up here unannounced
in the middle of...

34:21.183 --> 34:22.293
What?

34:25.194 --> 34:27.474
This. Everything.

34:30.170 --> 34:33.005
Look, I just need a place
to crash for a few days.

34:33.007 --> 34:34.106
Okay?

34:34.108 --> 34:36.241
No. No, not okay.

34:39.580 --> 34:41.246
Hey, don't unpack.

34:41.248 --> 34:43.782
Relax, Alex. It's only vapor.

34:45.953 --> 34:48.786
Okay, it may not look like it,

34:48.789 --> 34:50.589
but everything in this house...

34:50.591 --> 34:51.623
Shack.

34:56.266 --> 34:59.122
...has a purpose, a place.

35:02.236 --> 35:04.370
Don't touch anything.

35:04.372 --> 35:05.721
Where are you going?

35:09.010 --> 35:10.109
Out.

35:19.553 --> 35:23.389
We've all been brought
into this brotherhood.

35:23.391 --> 35:26.825
Okay, now the traditions in this room...

35:26.827 --> 35:28.427
They're not in any books.

35:28.429 --> 35:29.928
They're not in a manual.

35:29.930 --> 35:32.264
They got passed down from man to man.

35:32.266 --> 35:34.833
Our word is our bond.

35:34.835 --> 35:37.102
You never dishonor your country,

35:37.104 --> 35:39.238
you never dishonor this squadron.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.973
This is your family.

35:40.975 --> 35:42.007
All right?

35:45.613 --> 35:47.746
Your replacement, Buddha.

35:47.748 --> 35:49.481
The wheel of time turning,

35:49.483 --> 35:51.283
the young rising up to devour the old,

35:51.285 --> 35:52.851
the snake eating its tail,

35:52.853 --> 35:54.586
Oedipus killing his father...

35:54.588 --> 35:55.854
I get it, bro.

35:57.324 --> 35:58.991
Oh, man.

36:01.095 --> 36:02.327
It's about that time.

36:06.367 --> 36:07.366
Drink!

36:07.368 --> 36:09.334
- Yeah!
- Drink!

36:09.336 --> 36:11.336
Ready? Go! Go!

36:11.338 --> 36:13.439
This is a timed evolution, Chase.

36:13.441 --> 36:14.706
Put it down.

36:14.708 --> 36:17.109
Drink! Drink! Drink!

36:17.111 --> 36:20.145
Come on! You got this!
Make me proud, Chase!

36:20.170 --> 36:21.257
1:21!

36:21.282 --> 36:22.948
Up! Get it in!

36:22.950 --> 36:24.450
Come on! Finish it!

36:24.452 --> 36:25.451
1:27!

36:27.121 --> 36:28.153
Ohh!

36:28.155 --> 36:30.122
- Hey! Good?
- Yeah. I'm good.

36:30.124 --> 36:31.390
Okay, you're not finished.

36:31.392 --> 36:33.025
- No, come on, guys.
- No, you're not done.

36:33.027 --> 36:35.060
No. No, no, no.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.061
This...

36:38.699 --> 36:42.701
...is a symbol of the brothers
that you have sworn to protect.

36:42.703 --> 36:44.036
Uh-huh.

36:44.038 --> 36:45.904
Okay, so...

36:45.906 --> 36:48.807
you guard him with your life.

36:51.412 --> 36:53.078
Hey, Ghetto, if that needs some air,

36:53.080 --> 36:54.680
you know where to blow it, don't you?

36:56.150 --> 36:57.704
Oh, you can show him,
Buck. You had him last.

36:57.706 --> 36:59.017
Yes, he can.

37:01.188 --> 37:04.323
And this... the weapon you
will use to defend them.

37:04.325 --> 37:06.758
Keep it oiled and ready at all times.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.527
- On your knees.
- Take a knee.

37:08.529 --> 37:10.429
Go down! On your knees!

37:10.431 --> 37:13.198
You keep this on you at all times.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.233
All times!

37:14.235 --> 37:17.169
I'm deathly serious.

37:22.621 --> 37:24.187
Welcome to White Squadron.

37:26.580 --> 37:28.080
Don't suck.

37:28.082 --> 37:29.248
Welcome, brother.

37:32.353 --> 37:34.186
Don't be afraid to
live by your own rules.

37:34.188 --> 37:37.122
Hey, if you ever try to
blow a hole in a steel ship

37:37.124 --> 37:39.691
with us in it again,
I will take that away.

37:39.693 --> 37:40.692
Got it.

37:40.694 --> 37:41.727
- Okay?
- Yeah.

37:41.729 --> 37:42.694
Yeah.

37:47.801 --> 37:49.635
Cheers, guys. Thank you.

37:49.637 --> 37:52.037
That was us not too long ago.

37:52.039 --> 37:53.071
Total noobs.

37:53.073 --> 37:54.940
Yeah, Rip yarded us in.

37:55.910 --> 37:57.709
You remember his speech?

37:57.711 --> 37:59.633
I know you don't. You were
too busy running your mouth.

37:59.635 --> 38:00.879
Of course I do.

38:00.881 --> 38:02.915
You just said it word for word.

38:02.917 --> 38:03.916
All right.

38:03.918 --> 38:05.384
Don't look so surprised.

38:05.386 --> 38:07.653
I remember everything that man said.

38:07.655 --> 38:10.222
Just, you know, don't talk
about him like he's dead.

38:13.227 --> 38:17.396
Now that kid is looking at us
the same way we looked at Rip.

38:17.398 --> 38:19.331
You believe that?

38:19.333 --> 38:22.668
It's a good thing we
got it all figured out.

38:33.247 --> 38:34.980
All right, everyone out!

38:34.982 --> 38:36.081
Out!

38:38.919 --> 38:40.919
You too!

38:56.403 --> 39:01.607
Na... vy... SEAL.

39:04.924 --> 39:06.223
No.

39:11.118 --> 39:13.852
Sir. Please.

39:13.854 --> 39:15.320
Whatever you want...

39:16.490 --> 39:18.624
I should be talking to you?

39:20.327 --> 39:22.194
Terry McAlwain?

39:22.196 --> 39:24.196
Uh, yes. Yes.

39:24.198 --> 39:26.198
So, you've spoken to SymcoPetro.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.700
They'll pay you. Did they tell you that?

39:28.702 --> 39:31.336
Whatever it is you want,
they'll give it to you.

39:31.338 --> 39:32.504
They will.

39:32.506 --> 39:34.706
But... we're not animals.

39:34.708 --> 39:38.243
Y-You can't keep us here like this.

39:38.245 --> 39:40.979
We're hungry, and...

39:40.981 --> 39:42.881
Let him see.

39:42.883 --> 39:43.915
See what?

39:43.917 --> 39:45.050
Your hands.

39:46.887 --> 39:48.253
Why?

39:48.255 --> 39:50.922
I want him to see how hard you work.

39:50.924 --> 39:51.923
Don't do it.

39:51.925 --> 39:53.592
Show him!

39:57.097 --> 39:58.096
Show him.

40:11.178 --> 40:14.279
He says your hands
are soft, like a baby.

40:22.122 --> 40:23.755
What do you do now?

40:37.771 --> 40:40.605
No, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

40:40.607 --> 40:42.787
You got to tie that down!
Tie it down! Above the elbow!

40:42.789 --> 40:43.942
I give the orders!

40:48.415 --> 40:49.815
You are Navy SEAL.

40:51.315 --> 40:52.948
Special Forces.

40:57.257 --> 41:01.293
Na... vy...

41:01.295 --> 41:02.494
SEAL!

41:03.731 --> 41:07.866
Na... vy... SEAL.

41:07.868 --> 41:08.967
Hmm?

41:12.106 --> 41:15.240
Navy SEAL.

41:19.742 --> 41:22.914
Navy... SEAL.

41:22.916 --> 41:24.349
Yeah.

41:24.351 --> 41:27.085
I'm a Navy motherfucking SEAL.
