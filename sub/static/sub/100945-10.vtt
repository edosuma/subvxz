WEBVTT

00:21.062 --> 00:23.815
That is the most horrifying thing
I have ever seen.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.650
It's desecrating a sacred object.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.570
Agreed. They just trampled over
the American Koran.

00:28.653 --> 00:31.489
Isn't that breaking a US law,
even on the moon?

00:31.573 --> 00:34.034
US law applies 200 miles from a US flag.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.702
Two hundred miles from the coastline.

00:35.785 --> 00:38.121
Now, is the moon 200 miles away?

00:38.204 --> 00:40.957
It is not,
and running over a flag is not illegal.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.208
You're not a lawyer, Naird.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.418
I'm a corporate lawyer.

00:43.501 --> 00:46.087
They could argue that we abandoned
that flag when we left the moon.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.338
That would make it trash.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.925
Take... that... back.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.343
I just meant legally.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.971
Obviously, it's not trash.
It's the soul of America.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.515
We should run over one of their flags,
tit for tat.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.726
Where we gonna find a Chinese flag
on the moon?

01:00.268 --> 01:01.519
Make one out of our own?

01:01.603 --> 01:06.357
You don't rip up an American flag
to create a Chinese flag, you moron.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.817
We need to hit back hard.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.735
We can bomb.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.403
Big bomb, little bomb.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.905
-Smart bomb, stupid bomb.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.364
There's one for every occasion.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.991
A flag is a symbol.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.494
You can't kill people
for insulting a symbol.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.037
If it were up to me, we'd invade.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.288
I'm talking some serious

01:20.371 --> 01:22.707
-bull-in-a-China shop action.

01:22.791 --> 01:25.126
Let's knock down the Great Wall
they're so proud of.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.087
We got all these weapons.
We're never allowed to use them.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.046
Drives me crazy.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.757
Yeah, I talk to my therapist about this
all the time.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.383
-Where are we at with nukes?

01:32.467 --> 01:33.927
No, no. We're not going to nuke China.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.304
Could we get back on track here
for a second?

01:36.387 --> 01:38.473
Does anyone have
a valid suggestion to make?

01:38.556 --> 01:40.809
We're just joking around, Grandma. Jeez!

01:40.892 --> 01:43.561
Yeah, just blowing off steam there.
Don't be such a pussy.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.814
Wait. What? No. No, no, no.

01:45.897 --> 01:50.151
We need to do one of these ideas,
at least. Maybe more, right? Come on!

01:50.235 --> 01:53.404
I mean, aren't you guys tired
of everybody using us like a doormat?

01:56.199 --> 02:00.453
Look, this happened in space,
so the response must be in space as well.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.456
-I have consulted a space attorney.
-What the fuck?

02:03.540 --> 02:06.376
-There's no such thing. You got scammed.
-Now who's the dope?

02:06.459 --> 02:09.337
We signed
an international outer space treaty.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.923
Any sort of violence
and we break that treaty.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.758
We must retaliate. I will handle it.

02:13.842 --> 02:14.968
POTUS will be very happy.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.428
We will do something
significant and proportionate.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.765
I don't think POTUS will be happy
with a proportionate response.

02:21.599 --> 02:25.228
Well, then,
it'll be a little more than proportionate.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.939
I have taken it upon myself
to have a focus group

02:28.022 --> 02:31.484
in which we can determine
what would be an appropriate response.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.779
Ideally, what would you like to see happen
on the moon? Anybody.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.325
Research that benefits mankind.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.578
Yeah. Okay. What about you?
What about you?

02:41.661 --> 02:45.165
Yeah, something that helps everyone
and justifies the cost.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.374
Yeah. Yeah.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.002
What would be an example of something bad
that could happen on the moon?

02:49.085 --> 02:50.503
Anybody wanna answer that?

02:51.504 --> 02:55.300
An accident where a person gets hurt.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.843
Yeah, that would be bad,
wouldn't it?

02:57.343 --> 02:59.762
Could you ever imagine
supporting a war on the moon?

02:59.846 --> 03:00.763
No.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.599
That would be a terrible waste.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.600
Really?

03:03.975 --> 03:05.768
Do me a favor.
Watch this video real quick.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.482
That's America!
Keep watching. It's not over.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.612
Beep, beep, beep. Crunch.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.071
Huh?

03:17.155 --> 03:19.073
Does nobody respect us? Keep looking.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.618
That is our country
they're rolling all over.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.495
Yeah, we have to do something about that.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.832
I mean, maybe not a war,
but we should definitely do something.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.876
I'm loving this. Okay, this is fantastic.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.795
Let's feel out this direction.
Let's keep it going. Okay, what else?

03:32.879 --> 03:35.089
It should be retaliation
on the same level.

03:35.173 --> 03:38.134
Like, it should be a prank.
It should be like... graffiti!

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
Graffiti? All right, keep going.
That's not bad.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.679
Um... ding-dong ditch.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.266
Brown paper bag on fire,
but there's poop in it.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.437
-I don't know whose poop.
-Right, okay.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.148
-TP their rocket!
-TP their rocket!

03:52.232 --> 03:53.149
I love this.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.108
That's what it takes,

03:54.192 --> 03:56.110
a 100-year-old white man
to make this work!

03:56.194 --> 03:59.030
Okay, let's pop it on the board.
Here we go!

04:32.814 --> 04:34.691
How can there be no hammers?

04:34.774 --> 04:36.442
We must have packed hammers.

04:36.526 --> 04:40.238
<i>No. None of the big doctor brains</i>
<i>packed a hammer.</i>

04:40.321 --> 04:43.783
There are wrenches.
Then use a wrench as a hammer.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.536
<i>That's not how</i>
<i>you take care of your wrenches!</i>

04:46.619 --> 04:48.997
<i>No toothbrushes or deodorant either,</i>

04:49.080 --> 04:52.166
<i>but there are ten years' worth of tampons,</i>
<i>for some reason.</i>

04:52.250 --> 04:55.753
Wait.
Young man, what are you using as a shovel?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.715
<i>Sir, it's actually</i>
<i>Spaceman Obie Hanrahan, sir!</i>

04:58.798 --> 05:00.800
<i>And I'm using a metal moon scoop</i>

05:00.883 --> 05:03.594
<i>with an adjustable</i>
<i>crescent-shaped head, sir!</i>

05:03.678 --> 05:05.805
-<i> That's a wrench, you dimwit.</i>

05:05.888 --> 05:07.849
<i>Hey, what's that hissing noise?</i>

05:07.932 --> 05:09.017
Jesus-- Uh...

05:09.100 --> 05:12.562
you have to patch that up immediately,
or you'll all die.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.106
The-- The duct tape's in locker 1.

05:15.189 --> 05:18.943
Dr. Mallory, the Chinese Space Agency
just posted some video of their base.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.031
-Wow.
-Put it on the big screen.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.372
How many pillows do you need?

05:31.456 --> 05:33.291
It's already one-sixth gravity.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.169
How many did you serve like this?

05:36.252 --> 05:39.422
"How many did you serve like this?"

05:39.505 --> 05:40.965
Are you drunk right now?

05:43.259 --> 05:44.677
Fine. You're fired.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.179
Should I tell your dad?

05:46.971 --> 05:48.222
You know, sure, dude.

05:48.681 --> 05:49.766
Tell him.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.602
He doesn't have a fucking leg to stand on.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.236
Okay, this is what I learned,

06:02.320 --> 06:04.030
and I think you're gonna go crazy
for this.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.824
There are three cans of shaving cream
on that moon base,

06:06.908 --> 06:08.451
and there's two cans of hairspray.

06:08.534 --> 06:12.121
If we just switch those nozzles,
we can cause some serious mischief.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.415
It's not enough. They trampled our flag.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.541
What else you got?

06:15.625 --> 06:19.962
Okay, your eyebrows tested poorly
in men and women ages six to 45.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.464
Why are you testing my eyebrows?

06:21.547 --> 06:22.423
It was unsolicited.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.050
People just want
to talk about your eyebrows.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.010
The joint chiefs are on the phone
in the conference room.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.136
They want an update.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.473
<i>How's it going, General?</i>

06:30.556 --> 06:31.808
<i>Every news outlet on the planet</i>

06:31.891 --> 06:35.019
<i>is showing some Chinese rover</i>
<i>doing donuts on our most sacred...</i>

06:35.561 --> 06:36.562
<i>cloth.</i>

06:37.021 --> 06:39.107
We need a quick military response.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.650
-Oorah!
-Hooah!

06:40.733 --> 06:41.567
-Hooyah!
-Hooyah!

06:41.651 --> 06:43.236
Booyah!

06:43.319 --> 06:45.446
You have the go-ahead
to attack the Chinese base.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.489
How do you wanna do it?

06:46.572 --> 06:48.658
Our lead suggestion from the focus group

06:48.741 --> 06:50.743
would be to shaving-cream
the shit out of them.

06:51.327 --> 06:52.578
And if that's not enough,

06:53.037 --> 06:56.416
we also have the capability to TP as well.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.710
<i>And possibly graffiti the side</i>
<i>of their base with "China sucks."</i>

07:00.920 --> 07:01.754
Sound good?

07:01.838 --> 07:04.006
-Oora--
-No! No, no, no.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.509
We need to burn that Chinese base
to the ground.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.469
I thought that's why
you brought an arsonist!

07:10.263 --> 07:13.307
Well, not really, obviously.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.685
Yes, really, obviously!

07:15.768 --> 07:19.021
This-- This has been debated
in the policy circles

07:19.439 --> 07:21.441
as high up in the administration
as you can think!

07:21.524 --> 07:22.692
It's time to stand tough!

07:25.361 --> 07:27.864
Look, nobody wants to get back
at these commie bastards

07:27.947 --> 07:29.407
more than I do, but...

07:29.824 --> 07:34.287
breaking a treaty with a reprisal attack
of unwarranted destruction,

07:34.370 --> 07:38.499
and putting noncombatant scientists
in harm's way...

07:38.875 --> 07:40.001
Mmm...

07:40.084 --> 07:42.420
That's like three violations
of the Geneva Convention.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.838
Okay, look.

07:43.921 --> 07:45.715
I'm not a professional politician,

07:45.798 --> 07:48.718
but this European International Treaty,
come on!

07:48.801 --> 07:50.303
Don't get captured like a bunch of losers,

07:50.386 --> 07:52.513
and you don't have to worry about
how they treat you.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.184
How about we just continue to look for
some more creative solutions?

07:56.267 --> 07:58.436
Yeah, well,
I think destroying the base is lame,

07:58.519 --> 08:02.064
and it's a war crime, uh,
which you should never ever do.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.149
-All right, look!
-Uh, okay.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.734
You have your orders, Naird!

08:05.193 --> 08:07.111
<i>I need a complete outline and strategy</i>

08:07.195 --> 08:09.822
<i>for this battle plan</i>
<i>to destroy this Chinese base,</i>

08:09.906 --> 08:13.159
<i>and I need it shock, I need awe,</i>
<i>and I need it in PDF,</i>

08:13.242 --> 08:14.994
<i>'cause my computer doesn't have Word.</i>

08:18.706 --> 08:19.624
God.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.629
So that is the order from the top.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.839
You can't do that.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.635
These are scientists and astronauts.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.595
I have to. It's the chain of command.

08:32.678 --> 08:37.517
Mark, they just named the flat area
where we landed The Plains of Mallory.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.561
Oh, that is so cool. Congrats.

08:40.645 --> 08:45.483
Thank you. But now, it could become
the site of the first moon atrocity.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.902
I don't want to read that in a textbook.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.487
Yeah, nobody wants that.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.490
I'm sure cooler heads will prevail.

08:52.573 --> 08:53.824
Just some saber-rattling.

08:54.909 --> 08:58.079
The next resupply
can't launch for a month, so...

08:58.829 --> 09:02.833
hopefully, they'll have the time
to cool off before the guns show up.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.044
Yeah.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.976
Captain Ali,
I'd like you to look in locker 5.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.144
<i>It says "spare oxygen."</i>

09:22.228 --> 09:23.145
Just open it.

09:30.528 --> 09:33.030
Okay, but we do have spare oxygen
somewhere, right?

09:34.949 --> 09:36.450
What do you want us to do with these,
General?

09:36.534 --> 09:37.535
I'm not sure yet.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.413
Just, uh, show everyone how to use them.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.665
Make sure they're cleaned and loaded.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.625
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

09:45.876 --> 09:47.795
Loading and cleaning guns.

09:48.212 --> 09:52.883
Feels like no matter what I start doing,
I always end up loading and cleaning guns.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.803
I haven't been allowed
to touch one of these in forever.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.722
I just hope the general knows
what he's doing.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.141
What if the Chinese have guns?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.060
No. They're a research center.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.645
So are we.

10:07.982 --> 10:11.152
You already have guns on board?

10:11.235 --> 10:14.614
No toothbrushes, but room for guns?

10:14.697 --> 10:16.449
You lied to me, Naird!

10:16.532 --> 10:18.117
General Naird, Chief Scientist!

10:18.618 --> 10:20.036
They were for self-defense.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.370
Oh, sure they were!

10:21.454 --> 10:24.999
Sometimes,
provocation requires a show of force!

10:25.082 --> 10:28.461
Neville Chamberlain didn't do that,
and Hitler invaded Poland!

10:28.544 --> 10:31.255
Not everything is World War II!

10:31.339 --> 10:33.507
Well, not everything is Vietnam!

10:33.591 --> 10:36.093
I thought you were one of the good guys,

10:36.177 --> 10:38.554
with your John Wayne swagger.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.514
But you're no John Wayne.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.516
You are Wayne John!

10:43.601 --> 10:45.728
-Who?
-Wayne John!

10:45.811 --> 10:46.979
Wayne John!

10:47.438 --> 10:48.939
I worked with him at IBM!

10:49.023 --> 10:50.900
He stole pencils!

10:50.983 --> 10:52.360
My pencils!

10:52.443 --> 10:55.404
If you had any integrity at all,
you would quit!

10:55.488 --> 10:58.658
The person in line behind me
will be even worse!

10:58.741 --> 11:02.536
I know I'm not perfect,
but I know I'm not the worst.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.956
Well, you take that up
with your next chief scientist.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.875
-I quit!
-Adrian!

11:07.958 --> 11:08.876
Adrian!

11:10.294 --> 11:11.337
Adrian!

11:11.420 --> 11:14.298
Adrian! Adrian!

11:14.382 --> 11:16.717
Rocky! Rocky!

11:16.801 --> 11:17.802
Right?

11:35.027 --> 11:36.195
Hey, Captain Ali.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.535
<i>Whoa. What up, stalker?</i>

11:43.077 --> 11:45.705
<i>Just sitting there all creepy,</i>
<i>staring at me.</i>

11:46.956 --> 11:48.624
<i>How long have you been watching me, huh?</i>

11:48.958 --> 11:51.043
<i>Do you watch me sleep, too? </i>

11:51.127 --> 11:53.295
Do you want me to be watching you?

11:54.422 --> 11:57.341
<i>Uh, no. Gross. I was just messing around.</i>

11:58.551 --> 12:00.636
Well, that's not the story
your heart rate is telling.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.557
<i>I'm going into battle tomorrow.</i>

12:06.058 --> 12:09.603
<i>Anyway, um, I kind of thought</i>
<i>you were calling me</i>

12:09.687 --> 12:12.314
<i>with an "I just want you to know."</i>

12:12.398 --> 12:13.482
A what?

12:14.275 --> 12:15.735
<i>You know, an "I just want you to know."</i>

12:15.818 --> 12:19.321
<i>It's like when people are like,</i>
<i>"If we never see each other again,</i>

12:19.739 --> 12:21.115
<i>I just want you to know,</i>

12:22.158 --> 12:24.535
<i>like, how I feel."</i>

12:26.746 --> 12:27.955
Um...

12:28.205 --> 12:30.958
You know that all communications
with the launch room

12:31.041 --> 12:33.461
are recorded for posterity, Captain?

12:35.212 --> 12:37.006
<i>Okay. No. Copy that, Scientist.</i>

12:37.089 --> 12:39.675
<i>Yes, loud and clear, and never mind.</i>

12:40.217 --> 12:41.844
Actually, Chief Scientist now.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.220
Dr. Mallory quit today.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.389
<i>Oh, wow. I mean...</i>

12:46.474 --> 12:47.641
<i>Congratulations, I guess.</i>

12:47.725 --> 12:50.561
<i>But I also can't help thinking</i>
<i>that means I'm fucked.</i>

12:51.228 --> 12:52.855
No. You're a superhero.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.732
And the queen of TikTok.

12:55.524 --> 12:56.609
<i>The what?</i>

12:57.067 --> 12:58.736
<i>It's good to be black on the moon.</i>

12:58.819 --> 12:59.695
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

12:59.779 --> 13:01.697
<i>Okay.</i>

13:02.239 --> 13:05.910
<i>I cannot believe that's only like</i>
<i>the tenth weirdest thing about today.</i>

13:07.578 --> 13:08.704
Thanks for showing me.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.832
Yeah.<i> </i>Well, I just wanted you to know.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.626
That I'm a meme?

13:13.709 --> 13:16.712
Yeah!<i> </i>You know, in case, like,
we never see each other again,

13:17.296 --> 13:18.881
I just wanted you to know.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.181
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.770
Is there any, uh, sauce?

13:36.524 --> 13:37.650
I forgot the sauce.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.318
Oh, that's no problem.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.738
Do you have any cheese or, uh,
is there salad?

13:45.991 --> 13:48.244
Mark, you said you were a good cook.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.161
Yeah.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.622
I'm so sorry. I'm not gonna eat this.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.916
I'm not two years old.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.000
I apologize.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.502
My focus is off.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.921
-What's up?
-Adrian Mallory quit today.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.799
Why? Did you make him dinner?

14:03.634 --> 14:07.012
He didn't like something
that the military was doing.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.807
Oh, well,
he sounds like a spoiled little shit.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.476
Sometimes he is, but not this time.

14:13.477 --> 14:16.355
Well, will he come back
if you stop doing what you're doing?

14:16.772 --> 14:18.941
Ah, I can't. It was an order.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.528
No, what are you doing?

14:22.611 --> 14:25.656
Mark, what are you--
No. Stop it. I cannot let you eat that.

14:25.739 --> 14:26.574
It's barely cooked.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.741
It's crunchy.

14:27.825 --> 14:28.951
Oh, God. Here.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.745
No, no, no. No, no.

14:34.290 --> 14:38.043
I may be called upon to make a decision
that I have to be completely sober for.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.213
It's not about sex, is it?
Cause I don't mind if you're tipsy.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.762
I have to be prepared
to order soldiers into battle.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.473
Can't really talk about it.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.980
I don't know what to do.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.696
When you asked me out,

15:06.530 --> 15:08.699
you knew you had to tell me
about your wife.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.327
Even though it would probably ruin things.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.622
You literally couldn't do the wrong thing.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.249
So I'm not worried about you.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.754
What if I don't know
what the right thing to do is?

15:25.591 --> 15:26.508
But you do.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.177
Don't you?

15:38.103 --> 15:39.355
Help me defy an order.

15:43.984 --> 15:45.027
Ooh.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.656
That is where I shine.

15:49.281 --> 15:52.534
I've been defying authority
since I was 13.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.873
And now I'm gonna teach you

15:57.957 --> 16:00.918
to use the most subversive weapon
known to man:

16:01.001 --> 16:02.127
passive-aggression.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.504
Oh, God, I hate that.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.463
Yeah, of course,

16:04.546 --> 16:08.217
because you're a straight white male,
you always had other weapons.

16:08.300 --> 16:12.096
But the rest of us,
we have to be subtle in our disobedience,

16:12.179 --> 16:13.305
or we risk punishment.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.724
Oh, so interesting.
Go on. I'm so interested.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.519
No, see, that's sarcasm. That's different.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.771
Imagine in this situation,

16:20.854 --> 16:24.233
you could say that
you're following through with the order,

16:24.316 --> 16:25.985
but then you forget to,

16:26.068 --> 16:28.862
or you can interpret
that order creatively.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.615
"Destroy the bathroom"
could mean a number of things

16:31.699 --> 16:35.202
and, if all else fails,
you can feign incompetent,

16:35.285 --> 16:36.578
which shouldn't be a problem.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.539
Well, that explains Brad, doesn't it?

16:38.622 --> 16:39.915
Not entirely.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.250
Huh.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.840
-What are we to do?
-I'll handle it!

16:47.923 --> 16:48.924
He'll handle it.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.970
Mr. Secretary, I just want to let you know
before we begin,

16:53.053 --> 16:55.723
that I am running low on cell battery,
so I may lose you.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.850
Uh, here's the situation as it stands.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.560
Well done, sir.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.895
Nobody answer the phone
for the next two hours.

17:01.979 --> 17:02.938
Yes, sir.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.112
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

17:10.487 --> 17:12.906
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

17:21.123 --> 17:21.957
Got a smoke?

17:25.502 --> 17:26.670
Can't buy your own?

17:27.296 --> 17:28.172
I can.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.507
Just don't feel like it.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.140
Tell you what.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.392
I'll give it to you in my truck.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.816
Come on. We're going to a party.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.615
Fuck it.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.682
I've got it.

18:20.766 --> 18:24.436
Beijing is hosting
the Winter Olympics 2022.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.437
We boycott.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.814
Then they win even more medals.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.775
No, China's surprisingly awful
at Winter Olympic sports.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.777
But boy-oh-boy, Norway would be happy.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.821
Okay, say you are a criminal.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.615
What would be meaner
than TP-ing somebody's house,

18:36.698 --> 18:39.660
but not as aggressive
as home invasion-slash-murder?

18:39.743 --> 18:42.412
Tying the family up and letting them think
they're gonna be murdered.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.748
Then they live
with the fear and horror forever.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.544
Jesus, Brad.
No wonder my dogs are scared of you.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.422
Uh, excuse me, General, sir.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.800
The Sec Def is on
in the conference room for you.

18:56.009 --> 18:56.969
Balls!

18:57.261 --> 18:59.346
All right, tell him I'll be right there.

18:59.429 --> 19:00.472
Put him on hold.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.559
-What are you gonna say?
-I'm not gonna say anything.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.145
I'm gonna go eat egg salad sandwiches
until I puke.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.448
Uh...

19:20.576 --> 19:21.743
Hey. Hey!

19:22.244 --> 19:24.580
Hey, I think, um, you can just let me out,
like, right here.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.540
That's-- That's totally fine.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.419
Hey. You guys.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.046
Hey! Let me out here, okay?

19:34.673 --> 19:36.008
Excuse me!

19:36.758 --> 19:38.552
Can you please let me out?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.597
Fucking kidding me!

19:45.809 --> 19:48.562
What the hell?
Did you guys not hear me yelling?

20:09.291 --> 20:10.334
They're stonewalling us.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.294
Where-- Where-- Where's Grabaston?

20:12.377 --> 20:14.046
<i>In the air</i>
<i>and ready to swoop in!</i>

20:14.546 --> 20:17.716
<i>Big Eagle is ready to replace</i>
<i>the Dodo Bird!</i>

20:17.799 --> 20:19.843
I like what you said up there.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.803
I wish I was black on the moon.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.555
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

20:24.389 --> 20:27.434
Captain, when we first met,
you disobeyed an order.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.896
<i>Yeah, I remember it well, sir.</i>

20:31.480 --> 20:33.357
Today, I'm thinking about doing the same.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.027
<i>This is being recorded, General.</i>

20:40.447 --> 20:45.410
The generation that won World War II
was exposed to so much awful reality

20:45.494 --> 20:50.332
that they made mostly good decisions
for a long time after.

20:52.042 --> 20:56.171
Forget history, and you are doomed
to repeat the mistakes of the past.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.715
Forget how bad polio was,

20:59.341 --> 21:00.968
people stop taking vaccines.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.263
Forget how bad world wars are,

21:04.346 --> 21:06.390
people start puffing out their chests.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.851
The real enemy is arrogance.

21:14.356 --> 21:18.193
Angela, I think there are springs
and bolts and such

21:18.277 --> 21:20.404
in those Manchester Arms devices

21:20.487 --> 21:22.948
that would be better used
to build your habitat.

21:23.031 --> 21:26.702
I'd like you to disassemble them
and let Eddie use the parts.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.997
<i>You're telling me to...</i>

21:30.080 --> 21:32.708
<i>...to take the guns apart,</i>
<i>which would disable them, General.</i>

21:32.791 --> 21:33.834
That is correct.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.171
<i>Thin ice, General.</i>

21:39.131 --> 21:40.257
<i>Thin ice.</i>

21:58.734 --> 21:59.693
ID?

22:01.611 --> 22:02.779
Step aside, Gomer.

22:03.655 --> 22:07.784
Sir, I need to see some Space Force ID
to let anyone inside.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.120
Here is my Space Force ID.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.588
And a second ID with a photo.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.258
A passport, Costco card.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.260
If you have to run on home--

22:25.344 --> 22:26.803
Oh, for fuck's sakes, restrain him.

22:26.887 --> 22:27.763
Gladly.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.230
General Naird!

22:37.981 --> 22:42.402
You were ordered to order an attack,
and I am ordering you to obey that order.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.029
I'm not your waitress, Kick.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.615
I'm going to count to 125.

22:46.698 --> 22:47.949
Just count to three.

22:48.033 --> 22:51.411
Counting to 125 will give you ample time
to think it over.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.788
This is wrong, Kick.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.790
Deep down, you know it, too.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.458
I don't give a shit.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.085
Arrest him.

22:59.753 --> 23:03.131
And don't try to run, Naird,
or we'll shoot you in the back.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.136
Get me whoever is in charge up there.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.971
Her name is Captain Ali, sir.

23:10.472 --> 23:14.684
Captain Ali, you are hereby ordered
to attack the Chinese base.

23:14.768 --> 23:15.727
<i>Can't, sir.</i>

23:15.811 --> 23:16.728
<i>Guns are disabled.</i>

23:16.812 --> 23:20.107
<i>The barrels are now water pipes,</i>
<i>and the springs are in the thermostats.</i>

23:20.190 --> 23:22.901
Naird... that's treason.

23:22.984 --> 23:25.612
It's not treason
to disobey an unlawful order.

23:26.279 --> 23:29.241
Well, there must be something else
you can use as weapons.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.743
<i>We have a crazy amount of wrenches.</i>

23:31.827 --> 23:34.663
<i>The big brainiac</i>
<i>packed wrench after wrench.</i>

23:34.746 --> 23:35.705
Go get 'em.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.207
Bigger the better.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.334
<i>Sir, where is General Naird?</i>

23:39.418 --> 23:41.002
I am in command now.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.505
It's wrenchin' time.

23:44.923 --> 23:48.093
It, um... It looks like
we're actually doing this.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.429
Everybody suit up.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.055
Boots on the moon.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.558
Boots on the moon.

24:00.355 --> 24:01.189
Julio!

24:02.023 --> 24:04.109
-Spacesuit.
-Oh. Yes.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.152
Oh, okay.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.998
Hey, Bug, it's not really a good time.

25:00.081 --> 25:03.627
Dad, Dad, I'm in the desert, west of town,
with some sketchy dudes.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.297
Erin, it doesn't sound like
you're making good choices.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.924
You have to make good choices.

25:09.007 --> 25:12.093
It wasn't. It was a terrible choice,
but I need you to come get me, okay?

25:12.177 --> 25:14.221
You said I could always call you
if I needed a ride.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.432
I know, I know I did.
But I can't come right now.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.600
I've been arrested.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.977
What? No. Mom was arrested.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.312
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.439
I'm... I have been, too. I'm sorry.

25:25.565 --> 25:26.525
Well, that's great!

25:26.608 --> 25:29.236
Both my parents are in jail,
and I can't get a tattoo. Okay.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.278
Honey! Honey!

25:30.695 --> 25:31.571
God.

25:32.739 --> 25:33.657
Fu...

25:35.408 --> 25:36.326
All right.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.623
Yeah.

25:45.293 --> 25:47.170
<i>Duncan, it's Erin.</i>
<i>Can you come get me?</i>

25:47.254 --> 25:49.422
No. I'm sitting next to your dad.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.049
I got arrested, too.

25:51.132 --> 25:51.967
<i> Fuck!</i>

26:19.703 --> 26:22.581
For the record, I am against this action.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.873
Someone's taking notes, right?

26:25.542 --> 26:27.252
This is all Kick's baby now.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.465
We can't let this happen.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.050
Fuck Tony, come with me.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.597
My name is Dr. Adrian Mallory.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.684
I am the former Chief Scientist
of Space Force.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.521
And if the world
does not stop this madness,

26:46.605 --> 26:49.441
I will set myself on fire!

26:49.524 --> 26:51.359
Yes, the entire world is listening.
This is your moment.

26:51.818 --> 26:55.780
I'll give you one chance to change course!

26:55.864 --> 26:57.407
Don't do it. Don't do it.

26:57.490 --> 27:00.035
Don't you try and stop me, Brad!

27:00.118 --> 27:01.453
I am doing it!

27:01.953 --> 27:04.789
Okey-dokey. Well, you're a better man
than I'll ever be.

27:04.873 --> 27:05.707
Wait.

27:06.249 --> 27:07.751
Don't-- Goodbye!

27:09.169 --> 27:10.920
Okay, so what's in the can.
Is it gasoline?

27:11.004 --> 27:12.339
Yes, this is gas.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.382
I guess the first step would be
to sprinkle it on your pants.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.344
So I suppose I should do that now?

27:17.427 --> 27:18.261
Yeah.

27:20.805 --> 27:21.765
Oh, Jesus.

27:22.265 --> 27:24.059
If you need help,
I can help you out. Here...

27:24.142 --> 27:27.020
Thank you, Fuck Tony, but you know what?

27:27.729 --> 27:32.442
I-- I think I've proven
what I wanted to prove.

27:32.859 --> 27:35.987
I mean, let's face it.
At the end of the day, I think I'm done.

27:36.071 --> 27:38.198
-I'm good.
-We're already here. We got the gasoline.

27:38.281 --> 27:41.368
No, I know, but it's...
I'm good. It's fine. Thank you.

27:42.202 --> 27:43.036
Mom, I'm in trouble,

27:43.119 --> 27:45.622
and Dad and the only other guy I know
who could help are useless.

27:46.039 --> 27:48.458
Well, don't tell me that
when I can't do anything.

27:48.541 --> 27:49.751
Jesus, honey!

27:49.834 --> 27:51.169
Mommy, I'm scared.

27:53.213 --> 27:56.758
Erin, you're gonna have to handle this one
on your own.

28:18.488 --> 28:19.364
Fuck.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.687
Do you have your lighter in your pocket?

28:50.770 --> 28:52.856
Or are you just glad to see me?

28:52.939 --> 28:53.857
What?

28:55.066 --> 28:56.067
I have it.

28:58.445 --> 28:59.696
Okay. Okay.

29:01.990 --> 29:02.949
Good. Good. Good.

29:07.996 --> 29:08.872
There you go.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.416
Okay.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.168
Okay.

29:28.725 --> 29:29.601
Fuck.

29:49.120 --> 29:49.954
Fuck!

30:18.608 --> 30:20.777
Jesus! Erin, no helmet?

30:20.860 --> 30:22.111
I know. Sorry.

30:22.195 --> 30:24.531
-So, who doesn't have your back?
-Okay, yes.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.950
- You're my hero.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.339
It looks deserted.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.054
Okay.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.597
Let's do this thing.

30:51.808 --> 30:55.186
Wait. Dad, do you see something down there
in the gully?

30:58.231 --> 30:59.691
Oh, my God.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.328
-Maggie?
- Whoo!

31:12.412 --> 31:13.621
-Mom!
-Hi!

31:13.705 --> 31:14.831
I escaped!

31:14.914 --> 31:16.457
Just came to save you!

31:17.125 --> 31:18.126
Sweetie!

31:19.669 --> 31:21.129
Oh, you guys!

31:26.050 --> 31:27.886
-This is Louise.
-Hi.

31:27.969 --> 31:29.512
She's been very helpful.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.056
This is great!

31:33.308 --> 31:34.475
We're all together.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.061
And Louise.

31:51.910 --> 31:56.164
Tell General Grabaston we've rendered
the Chinese moon base inoperable.

31:56.247 --> 31:58.166
Destroyed the life-support systems,

31:58.249 --> 32:00.710
breached the capsule walls in all pods,

32:00.793 --> 32:03.254
and released the oxygen as ordered.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.882
We are returning with their extra stores

32:05.965 --> 32:10.178
and will prepare to receive the scientists
as refugees at the US base.

32:12.931 --> 32:13.890
Oh, shit!

32:14.265 --> 32:15.099
Captain Ali?

32:34.702 --> 32:35.870
Now what do we do?

32:38.831 --> 32:40.500
<i>You have one new message.</i>

32:40.625 --> 32:42.877
<i>Uh, sir,</i>
<i>I noticed that you escaped,</i>

32:42.961 --> 32:44.420
<i>which is great. Congrats.</i>

32:44.504 --> 32:46.547
<i>I don't believe you're a traitor.</i>

32:46.631 --> 32:49.384
<i>No matter, you know, what they're saying.</i>
<i>I don't wanna worry you,</i>

32:49.467 --> 32:52.387
<i>but the spacemen</i>
<i>are just a little tiny bit fucked.</i>

32:52.470 --> 32:55.306
<i>So if you could maybe sneak back</i>
<i>and give us a hand,</i>

32:55.390 --> 32:56.349
<i>you know, it'd be great.</i>

32:56.432 --> 32:57.767
<i>But, you know, of course,</i>

32:57.850 --> 33:01.354
<i>you'll probably be court-martialed</i>
<i>if you come back, so tough choice.</i>

33:01.437 --> 33:03.439
