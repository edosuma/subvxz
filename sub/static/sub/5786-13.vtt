00:00.710 --> 00:02.253
<i>Previously, on iZombie...</i>

00:02.462 --> 00:04.673
This is our guy.
I think he's the Chaos Killer.

00:04.881 --> 00:07.300
Blaine. This is the suspect
in the Meat Cute massacre.

00:07.509 --> 00:08.927
We found him.

00:09.135 --> 00:12.430
- So, we use FBI resources.
- Then we bust this SOB.

00:12.639 --> 00:14.349
I'm reading the news

00:14.557 --> 00:17.102
and then suddenly
your scary ass Pops
is staring at me.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.688
<i>The Chaos Killer
kidnapped the guy
just like our other customers.</i>

00:19.896 --> 00:22.357
We'll be taking
that tainted Utopium
that we need to make the cure.

00:22.565 --> 00:23.942
You said he knew
where to find it.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.236
Old high school buddy of mine
was a drug dealer.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.697
Him and this other dealer
swallowed a bunch of condoms
full of Utopium.

00:28.905 --> 00:33.326
So we have two bodies
packed full of tainted Utopium
buried in a shallow grave.

00:33.535 --> 00:36.246
<i>We've narrowed the location
to a single 100-acre field.</i>

00:39.040 --> 00:41.793
<i>Welcome to Boba Chatt,
the podcast of the Dark Side.</i>

00:47.966 --> 00:50.719
<i>Kylo Ren.
Emo brat, or supreme badass?</i>
Ravi!

00:50.927 --> 00:51.845
Ravi!

00:55.473 --> 00:56.975
- Ravi!
<i>- Kylo was the guy</i>

00:57.183 --> 00:58.727
<i>who claims that Fall Out Boy
was more than music.</i>

00:58.935 --> 01:00.812
<i>I'm more scared
of Rick Moranis
as Dark Helmet</i>

01:01.021 --> 01:02.272
<i>than Kylo Ren.</i>

01:11.406 --> 01:12.699
We did it!

01:12.907 --> 01:15.744
Here he is! Huh?
Zombie cure, here we come!

01:16.870 --> 01:18.288
It isn't one of our guys.

01:19.998 --> 01:22.542
Ours have been
dead for nearly two years.

01:22.751 --> 01:24.627
This one's only
a couple of months gone.

01:26.838 --> 01:27.964
Then who is this?

01:54.491 --> 01:55.408
Geo-whatting?

01:55.617 --> 01:56.993
Geocaching.

01:57.202 --> 01:58.995
It's a real world outdoor
treasure hunting game.

01:59.204 --> 02:01.915
Strangers leave caches,
post the GPS coordinates,

02:02.123 --> 02:03.583
and then people like us
go out and find them.

02:03.792 --> 02:04.793
That's what we were doing.

02:05.001 --> 02:05.877
What sort of treasures?

02:06.086 --> 02:07.545
Oh! Let's see.

02:07.754 --> 02:10.173
Um, Matchbox cars,
sets of crayons.

02:10.381 --> 02:12.258
Yeah. I found
a wheat penny once.

02:12.467 --> 02:14.552
So treasures for children.

02:14.761 --> 02:17.263
It's more about the joy
of discovery.

02:17.472 --> 02:19.390
Why do men
climb mountains, Clive?

02:19.599 --> 02:21.017
Because it tests
their endurance,
their courage,

02:21.226 --> 02:23.728
their sense of themselves
as men?

02:23.937 --> 02:25.980
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you drawing a comparison?

02:26.189 --> 02:27.315
Clive?

02:27.524 --> 02:30.026
The victim appears
to be in his 30s.

02:30.235 --> 02:32.070
One gunshot wound
in his chest. One in his back.

02:32.278 --> 02:36.241
No ID, but a coaster
with a phone number.

02:36.449 --> 02:39.536
Maybe whoever's answered
this number can ID our vic.

02:39.744 --> 02:41.830
Major, can I have a word?

02:45.917 --> 02:47.961
What can I do for you,
Detective?

02:48.169 --> 02:50.296
Some new evidence
came to light in the
Meat Cute case,

02:50.505 --> 02:52.757
and I wanted to ask you
a couple more questions.

02:52.966 --> 02:55.552
What do you suppose
Clive is asking Major about?

02:55.760 --> 02:56.886
Dunno.

02:57.095 --> 02:58.263
He didn't buy
the geocaching story?

02:58.471 --> 03:00.181
I thought he did,
but who knows?

03:00.390 --> 03:02.892
You were arrested
for breaking into a man's car.

03:03.101 --> 03:08.523
You said this man,
Julien Dupont, was in
possession of a human brain.

03:08.731 --> 03:10.692
This was the same man
you later claimed
broke into your house.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.652
Look, I said a lot of things,

03:12.861 --> 03:14.988
and was urged to seek
medical treatment.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.448
By you, if I recall.

03:17.657 --> 03:19.450
Well, good news.

03:19.659 --> 03:21.202
The doctors
at the mental institution
were able to cure me.

03:22.871 --> 03:24.622
Realized it was all
just in my head.

03:26.624 --> 03:28.209
I had a vision
last night, Ravi.

03:28.418 --> 03:29.878
Yeah?

03:30.086 --> 03:32.463
You know
some idiot is moving in
on Mr. Boss' drug trade?

03:32.672 --> 03:34.257
That would explain
the corner boys ending up
in our drawers

03:34.465 --> 03:35.425
with pocketfuls of lucky U.

03:35.633 --> 03:36.926
That idiot is Blaine.

03:37.969 --> 03:39.429
Are you sure?

03:39.637 --> 03:42.473
In my vision,
Blaine's flunky, Don E.,
was selling it.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.477
These brains, man.

03:46.686 --> 03:49.105
You handed me
a Holocaust survivor.

03:49.314 --> 03:51.357
You want me to describe
some of my visions to you?

03:51.566 --> 03:53.234
She was a classical violinist.

03:53.443 --> 03:54.694
Go out
and impress some ladies.

03:54.903 --> 03:56.029
Where's Natalie, man?

03:56.237 --> 03:57.989
<i>I'm a zombie. I'm not dead.</i>

03:58.198 --> 03:59.741
Natalie's not available.

04:00.617 --> 04:01.826
Work it out, Blaine.

04:02.035 --> 04:03.661
Or maybe the next story
I publish in the paper

04:03.870 --> 04:05.413
you won't like as much
as the last one.

04:10.084 --> 04:11.461
It's gonna be gross, isn't it?

04:11.669 --> 04:13.338
He has been dead
for a couple of months.

04:13.546 --> 04:15.965
But I don't even
know anyone who's died.

04:16.174 --> 04:17.759
He had your phone number
written on a coaster.

04:17.967 --> 04:19.677
I'm afraid
you're our only lead.

04:20.803 --> 04:21.846
Okay.

04:22.055 --> 04:22.972
Do it.

04:26.726 --> 04:27.685
Oh!

04:30.438 --> 04:32.565
Oh, this jackass.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.359
You do know him?

04:34.567 --> 04:36.819
Kind of. His name's Corey.

04:37.028 --> 04:39.030
I hooked up with him
a couple months ago.

04:39.239 --> 04:41.366
Dick never called me again.

04:41.574 --> 04:43.618
Possibly because he was dead?

04:46.621 --> 04:50.583
Yeah. You're right.
That's probably why.

04:50.792 --> 04:51.834
'Cause I know
he had a good time.

04:53.378 --> 04:54.504
You know
this Corey's last name?

04:54.712 --> 04:56.297
Mmm-mmm.

04:56.506 --> 04:58.091
He was just a guy
I'd always see
at Possibilities.

04:58.299 --> 04:59.634
- That's a bar?
- Yeah.

04:59.842 --> 05:00.760
Did he work there?

05:01.886 --> 05:05.640
No. He was an FBI agent.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.559
He was in Seattle
infiltrating a gang
of bank robbers.

05:12.063 --> 05:14.065
I'll run this by Bozzio.

05:14.274 --> 05:17.193
If she bears your children,
you'll start using her
first name, right?

05:18.945 --> 05:20.655
Thank you for your help,
Miss Schafer.

05:20.863 --> 05:21.823
I'll show you out.

05:22.573 --> 05:23.533
Bye.

05:24.701 --> 05:25.994
You realize this Corey's brain

05:26.202 --> 05:27.578
could lead us to the
tainted Utopium?

05:27.787 --> 05:28.871
How do you figure?

05:29.080 --> 05:30.206
Well, it stands to reason
there aren't multiple killers

05:30.415 --> 05:31.666
dumping bodies
in the same field.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.501
So whoever executed
this FBI agent...

05:33.668 --> 05:36.462
Probably also
murdered the two guys
we've been digging for.

05:36.671 --> 05:38.089
Find Corey's killer...

05:38.298 --> 05:39.799
And maybe we can get him
to tell us where he buried

05:40.008 --> 05:41.592
Drake's high school buddy
and his friend.

05:41.801 --> 05:43.886
What better time
to be on FBI agent brain.

05:58.026 --> 06:01.070
Would Bozzio even know
if the FBI sent an agent
to Seattle

06:01.279 --> 06:03.239
who was working
deep undercover?

06:03.448 --> 06:06.951
She says if an agent had been
missing for a couple months,
she would.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.703
This Corey guy's not FBI.

06:10.288 --> 06:12.081
You know,
I used to bartend.

06:12.290 --> 06:13.416
You never mentioned that.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.126
Yeah.

06:15.335 --> 06:17.295
At this island-themed place
called Jamaican Me Thirsty.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.048
The bartenders were the show,
juggling bottles,

06:20.256 --> 06:22.425
making drinks blindfolded,
dancing on the bar.

06:23.551 --> 06:24.719
I was kind of a big deal.

06:26.262 --> 06:27.680
Don't bother
looking for the place now.

06:27.889 --> 06:29.265
Wasn't planning to.

06:29.474 --> 06:31.059
Went under back in '09.

06:33.478 --> 06:35.104
I invented the Orgasm, Clive.

06:35.855 --> 06:37.273
Amaretto.

06:37.482 --> 06:39.609
Irish Cream whiskey.
Coffee liqueur. That was me.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.155
Seattle PD.

06:44.364 --> 06:47.116
Do you recognize this man?

06:47.325 --> 06:48.618
Give a girl a little warning.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.247
Yeah, that's Big Fish.

06:53.456 --> 06:54.749
Hasn't been around
in a while, though.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.292
We were told
his name was Corey.

06:56.501 --> 06:58.378
Yeah, Corey Carp.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.004
But everyone
called him Big Fish.

07:00.213 --> 07:02.173
Because he's a big guy
and his name is Carp?

07:02.382 --> 07:03.716
No.

07:03.925 --> 07:05.968
Because everything
out of his mouth was a lie.

07:06.177 --> 07:07.053
Ah!

07:07.261 --> 07:08.304
A fish story.

07:09.639 --> 07:10.515
How'd he die?

07:10.723 --> 07:11.682
He was murdered.

07:11.891 --> 07:13.059
The woman
who identified his body

07:13.267 --> 07:14.519
said she saw him here often.

07:14.727 --> 07:16.312
Yeah. He worked
for the company

07:16.521 --> 07:18.689
that rents us
all our arcade games.

07:18.898 --> 07:20.858
He'd come in
a couple nights a week,
collect all the quarters,

07:21.067 --> 07:23.152
then he'd sit around and try
and chat up the ladies.

07:23.361 --> 07:24.695
He'd sniff out
the drunkest girls

07:24.904 --> 07:26.322
and tell them anything.

07:26.531 --> 07:28.699
That he was
a 9/11 first responder,

07:28.908 --> 07:30.785
or that he was drafted
by the Seahawks,

07:30.993 --> 07:32.912
but blew out a knee
before he ever played a snap.

07:33.121 --> 07:36.582
Or an FBI agent
infiltrating a gang
of bank robbers.

07:36.791 --> 07:37.667
Yeah.

07:37.875 --> 07:38.793
Stuff like that.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.337
Too bad about Big Fish.
Nice guy.

07:41.546 --> 07:42.463
Hey.

07:43.548 --> 07:44.507
What's up?

07:51.347 --> 07:57.145
"Pinball Vintage Amusements.
Pier 55. 8500 Alaskan Way."

07:57.353 --> 07:59.814
You recognize that address?

08:00.022 --> 08:01.899
Mr. Boss' warehouse.

08:02.108 --> 08:04.402
Big Fish worked for Mr. Boss.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.695
And now he's dead.

08:14.871 --> 08:17.832
Still the insolent boy.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.919
I blame my upbringing.

08:22.128 --> 08:23.880
Clearly, I wasn't
beaten enough as a child.

08:24.088 --> 08:26.340
It remains my greatest regret.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.302
Really?

08:29.510 --> 08:32.263
So you're over losing out
to Eva Braun, huh?

08:32.472 --> 08:35.475
Why has my father's
domestic help joined us
for the reading of his will?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.768
It was a stipulation
he requested.

08:37.977 --> 08:39.020
And it won't be a reading.

08:39.228 --> 08:40.438
Not exactly.

08:40.646 --> 08:42.440
Hmm.

08:42.648 --> 08:46.110
<i>To my dear friend,
Frieda Bader,</i>

08:46.319 --> 08:49.780
<i>who has served me loyally
for 35 years,</i>

08:49.989 --> 08:52.950
<i>I leave $10 million
and the Lake Como estate.</i>

08:53.159 --> 08:54.911
And why not?

08:55.119 --> 08:57.288
She only starved
your son to punish him
for tracking in mud.

08:57.497 --> 09:00.458
Gave away his dog
when he was caught
shoplifting bubblegum.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.793
And you still believe
that barking, shedding mutt

09:03.002 --> 09:04.921
was given away.

09:05.129 --> 09:07.632
You never wondered
why the rose bush
in the south garden

09:07.840 --> 09:09.008
grew so fast and full?

09:10.593 --> 09:12.595
<i>To my son, Blaine.</i>

09:12.803 --> 09:15.431
Blaine! Old man
Newcomb's on the phone.

09:15.640 --> 09:16.599
Handle it.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.017
Says it's urgent.

09:20.645 --> 09:21.604
Fine. We'll handle it.

09:24.982 --> 09:28.361
<i>To my son, Blaine,
I leave the balance
of my assets.</i>

09:28.569 --> 09:32.156
<i>The houses
in Seattle and Maui,
the cabin in Whistler,</i>

09:32.365 --> 09:34.992
<i>the controlling shares
in Vantage Elite Properties.</i>

09:35.201 --> 09:37.203
<i>In the following
circumstances, however,</i>

09:37.411 --> 09:40.289
<i>this section of the will
becomes null.</i>

09:42.500 --> 09:46.796
<i>If my death has resulted
from foul play,</i>

09:47.004 --> 09:52.176
<i>then all of my assets will
be awarded to Frau Bader</i>

09:52.385 --> 09:55.805
<i>and her descendants
should she not outlive me.</i>

09:57.682 --> 09:58.724
He can't do this.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.476
A prescient man, your father.

10:00.685 --> 10:02.687
He was murdered
by a serial killer!

10:02.895 --> 10:05.147
Or anyone
with a can of spray paint.

10:05.356 --> 10:06.941
Liquidate everything.

10:07.149 --> 10:08.484
Deposit all funds
to this account.

10:11.529 --> 10:12.572
I'm contesting this.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.074
You're welcome to.

10:15.283 --> 10:19.662
But I can assure you,
it's legally-binding.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.421
Blaine, you need
to come down here, quick!

10:28.629 --> 10:30.506
<i>Why's that, Don E?</i>

10:30.715 --> 10:32.883
We blew one of our breakers,
the fridge has been off

10:33.092 --> 10:34.760
and I think
our brains went bad.

10:40.600 --> 10:45.396
<i>♪ Happy birthday
to you, Blaine</i>

10:45.605 --> 10:47.607
<i>♪ I think this gift
will make good...</i>

10:47.815 --> 10:49.859
It's not my birthday, Don E.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.445
<i>♪...brain ♪</i>

10:52.653 --> 10:54.905
Well, then maybe we should
return your present.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.881
Old man Newcomb trapped him
in his panic room.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.801
- It's the Chaos Killer.
- What?

11:16.010 --> 11:17.511
He had spray paint cans
on him.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.181
And this.

11:23.267 --> 11:24.560
We meet again, old friend.

11:32.777 --> 11:35.863
Ah! He's waking up.

11:41.369 --> 11:42.995
Scott E?

11:43.204 --> 11:46.666
Nope. I'm flattered, though.
That was one good-looking man.

11:49.001 --> 11:51.170
Rise and shine, Major Bummer.

11:51.379 --> 11:53.297
What do you think
of my latest business venture?

11:53.506 --> 11:56.050
Your girlfriend gives it
her old zombie stamp
of approval.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.678
Liv doesn't...

11:58.886 --> 12:01.472
No, she's totally down with me
getting my brains from people
that don't need them anymore.

12:01.681 --> 12:03.224
We're BFFs now.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.726
Who else is gonna feed
Seattle's zombies?

12:05.935 --> 12:07.978
At least until
you kill them all, right?

12:08.187 --> 12:09.063
I'm not killing...

12:10.856 --> 12:13.818
The lying to save your
life section comes later.

12:14.026 --> 12:17.238
So, you're the Chaos Killer.

12:17.405 --> 12:18.656
Did you know that
those are my customers

12:18.864 --> 12:19.740
you've been taking out?

12:19.949 --> 12:21.867
My income stream?

12:22.076 --> 12:23.160
I'm sure you did.

12:23.369 --> 12:25.287
Don E.

12:25.496 --> 12:27.832
How soon
could you have a grave dug?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.417
I have plans, actually.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.086
A few hours.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.754
Well, let's get 'er done.

12:36.716 --> 12:38.259
Bad news, brother.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.679
Today is the last day
of your life.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.514
So you better get straight
with your God,

12:43.723 --> 12:44.932
'cause here comes
the big one.

12:45.141 --> 12:47.143
You comfy in there?

12:47.351 --> 12:50.896
I ask, because it's where
you're going to be
spending eternity.

12:51.105 --> 12:54.525
But because
I'm a forgiving man,

12:54.734 --> 12:56.861
I'm willing to let you decide
which way you go out.

12:57.069 --> 12:58.696
There's quick and painless,

12:58.904 --> 13:00.781
a bullet straight
to the heart.

13:00.990 --> 13:02.825
I know, a head shot
would be quicker,

13:03.033 --> 13:05.828
but that brain of yours
is gonna fetch a pretty penny.

13:06.036 --> 13:09.999
Or ,
we turn you into a zombie

13:11.542 --> 13:13.252
and we bury you in this box,

13:13.461 --> 13:14.962
where you will suffer forever

13:15.171 --> 13:17.256
with an abiding
hunger for brains

13:17.465 --> 13:18.758
that you will never sate.

13:18.966 --> 13:22.511
Wait.
What do you want to know?

13:22.720 --> 13:26.098
Well, it's obvious
there's a leak in
my organization.

13:26.307 --> 13:29.059
I mean, how else are you
finding my zombies?

13:29.268 --> 13:32.229
Give me a name,
and we'll go the quick route.

13:32.438 --> 13:33.731
Scout's honor.

13:33.939 --> 13:37.526
Otherwise it is...

13:37.735 --> 13:38.903
...express train
to Zombieland.

13:39.111 --> 13:40.738
You're not a zombie,
all right?

13:40.946 --> 13:42.615
So what do you plan
on doing with that finger?

13:44.992 --> 13:47.161
Chief!

13:47.369 --> 13:49.413
So, you've got zombie-dar.

13:49.622 --> 13:51.665
That explains so much.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.459
Of course, you're not just
wandering around the streets

13:53.667 --> 13:54.752
waiting for it to go...

13:56.420 --> 13:57.379
...off.

14:01.509 --> 14:04.094
Do you believe me now? Hmm?

14:04.303 --> 14:05.888
The part about me
turning you into a zombie?

14:07.056 --> 14:09.141
I was given a list.

14:09.350 --> 14:12.812
Three hundred names,
all suspected zombies,

14:13.020 --> 14:18.651
all connoisseurs of fake tans,
hair dye and hot sauce.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.946
My job was to figure out
which ones were zombies
and which ones weren't,

14:22.154 --> 14:23.864
and get rid of the ones
that are.

14:24.073 --> 14:26.033
I was told
that if I didn't do it,

14:26.242 --> 14:28.911
they would take out
every single person
on the list,

14:29.119 --> 14:30.746
and they would start with Liv.

14:30.955 --> 14:34.542
Oh. Who's the "they"?

14:34.750 --> 14:36.585
Let me know
who's making you do this.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.421
No.

14:39.630 --> 14:42.383
You must have a pair on you
the size of watermelons.

14:42.550 --> 14:45.928
If I told you,
you have no reason
to keep me alive.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.513
And aren't you a little
bit interested to know

14:47.721 --> 14:49.640
if you're on their list?

14:49.849 --> 14:51.350
Maybe a few more
hours in the dark

14:51.559 --> 14:53.644
will make that quick death
more appealing.

14:55.396 --> 14:57.940
Close him up.
I'm not going to miss you.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.574
This pathological liar brain
is gonna get me in trouble.

15:06.782 --> 15:07.700
I can feel it.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.034
Not with me.

15:09.243 --> 15:11.036
I'll know the truth
when I hear it.

15:11.245 --> 15:12.454
Ahh!

15:12.663 --> 15:14.123
I stand corrected.

15:14.331 --> 15:17.710
- It's a bloodbath.
- Oh, damn it.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.086
I was afraid of that.

15:19.253 --> 15:21.422
What am I looking at, Ravi?

15:21.630 --> 15:23.173
Matricide.

15:23.382 --> 15:25.843
These six young zombie rats
are clones of New Hope.

15:26.051 --> 15:28.929
The remains you see here
are those of the mother
that gave birth to them.

15:29.138 --> 15:32.641
Apparently, the little clones
decided it was time to switch
from mother's milk to brains.

15:32.850 --> 15:33.893
Why the clones?

15:34.101 --> 15:36.103
When we find
the tainted Utopium,

15:36.312 --> 15:38.772
I'd prefer to test on rats,
normal and zombie,
rather than humans.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.441
New Hope,
like Blaine and Major,

15:40.649 --> 15:42.526
became a zombie
and was given the cure.

15:42.735 --> 15:44.695
Her clone should give us
the most accurate picture

15:44.904 --> 15:46.196
of what Blaine and Major
can expect.

15:46.405 --> 15:48.657
I'd hate to lose
a perfectly good zombie rat.

15:48.866 --> 15:49.867
Let's use Blaine
as our guinea pig.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.619
You don't really mean that.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.454
What does he need to do
to prove to you that
he's the devil?

15:53.662 --> 15:55.080
Put up a sign?

15:56.624 --> 16:00.210
- He's mocking us.
- I really hate this guy.

16:00.419 --> 16:01.670
I'm gonna keep up
surveillance on him,

16:01.879 --> 16:03.339
but he knows we're out there.

16:03.547 --> 16:04.882
He can pull that hearse
right up to their back door,

16:05.090 --> 16:06.800
smuggle whatever he wants
in and out.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.470
Could there be a better front
for a serial killer?

16:09.678 --> 16:11.889
I mean, he can cremate bodies,
bury bodies.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.390
Hey.

16:13.599 --> 16:14.892
Hey, Liv. What's up?

16:15.100 --> 16:16.018
Clive didn't tell you?

16:17.311 --> 16:18.395
About my lottery ticket?

16:18.604 --> 16:20.522
First I've heard of it.

16:20.731 --> 16:22.483
I hit five out of six numbers,
and I only missed the sixth
by one.

16:22.650 --> 16:25.069
I was this close
to $40 million.

16:25.277 --> 16:26.820
Five out of six numbers,

16:27.029 --> 16:28.530
I think that
still wins you 50 grand
or something like that.

16:30.074 --> 16:31.951
Oh shoot!

16:32.159 --> 16:36.330
Why did I tear up my ticket?
I just was so mad.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.165
Live and learn, I guess.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.086
That's very Zen of you.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.088
Well, back to the salt mines.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.048
You texted?

16:46.256 --> 16:47.591
Yeah.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.177
It turns out Corey Carp's
$75,000 luxury sedan

16:50.386 --> 16:52.096
has been in our impound lot
for the past couple of months.

16:52.304 --> 16:53.389
How did he afford...

16:53.597 --> 16:55.057
Guess what we found
in the trunk?

16:55.265 --> 16:57.142
A goose that lays golden eggs?

16:57.351 --> 17:00.270
Thirteen thousand quarters
stashed in his spare tire
wheel well.

17:00.479 --> 17:02.439
What if he was skimming
and Mr. Boss found out?

17:02.648 --> 17:06.026
Well, that's one way to end up
buried in a shallow grave.

17:06.235 --> 17:09.613
Look, I know it's hard
to feel bad for someone
that grew up with a nanny,

17:09.822 --> 17:11.907
but I hope no one is picturing
Mary Poppins here.

17:13.993 --> 17:15.452
Should we see what he wants?

17:15.661 --> 17:17.413
I sure don't want my hole
to go to waste.

17:19.665 --> 17:22.543
Yeah, Chief,
"That's what she said."

17:22.710 --> 17:23.711
Don't bother.

17:29.508 --> 17:30.926
So?

17:31.135 --> 17:32.261
Your customers aren't dead.

17:33.846 --> 17:37.099
I can bring them back to you.
Eventually.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.475
They're not dead?

17:38.684 --> 17:39.935
Hey, Blaine!
You can get your dad back!

17:43.605 --> 17:45.274
How badly do you want
to see your dad again?

17:55.367 --> 17:57.453
My handlers don't care
which zombie I take out next

17:57.661 --> 17:59.663
as long as I make my way
steadily down my list.

17:59.872 --> 18:01.540
And they have you freeze them?

18:01.749 --> 18:05.669
- They think I'm killing them.
- Killing sounds easier.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.671
Yeah, except I'm
not a murderer.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.549
I bet you tell that
to all the families

18:10.758 --> 18:12.009
grieving for their loved ones.

18:13.677 --> 18:16.346
So, how did they find you?

18:16.555 --> 18:19.058
Help wanted ad?
"Zombie killer needed."

18:19.266 --> 18:23.353
They knew Liv was a zombie.
So they bugged her phone
and learned stuff.

18:23.562 --> 18:26.982
So who would want
zombies gone, but
want it done quietly?

18:28.817 --> 18:30.152
I'll figure it out.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.989
In the meantime,
I'm gonna need my dad back.

18:34.198 --> 18:35.824
God, do I miss that man.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.622
Nope. Can't do it.
You need me to
show you a photo or...

18:41.830 --> 18:44.333
No, I have no doubt
which one is your dad.

18:44.541 --> 18:48.253
Imperious, fancy dresser,
owns a bust of himself.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.005
That's the guy!

18:50.214 --> 18:52.508
And from here on, I tell you
which zombies you take out.

18:52.716 --> 18:54.426
I think we could solve a few
of each other's problems.

18:54.635 --> 18:55.969
There's someone out there.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.137
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.431
Hey. Hey. Hey.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.267
It's the FBI, man.
They've got a crush on me.

19:02.476 --> 19:04.561
They've got it in their head
that I'm the Chaos Killer.

19:04.770 --> 19:07.856
You're gonna have
to leave here the same way
you came in, back of a hearse.

19:08.065 --> 19:09.274
Chief will take you.

19:10.692 --> 19:11.944
All right.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.070
Uh, Major.

19:13.695 --> 19:14.655
Yeah?

19:15.906 --> 19:17.324
I know where you live.

19:17.533 --> 19:21.203
I know where Liv, um, lives.

19:21.411 --> 19:24.039
Give me my dad or things
are gonna get ugly fast, okay?

19:28.460 --> 19:29.753
How can you not see it?

19:29.962 --> 19:31.672
Sorry, mate.
Not sure I follow.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.549
She takes on
certain personality traits

19:33.757 --> 19:35.759
of the victims
we're investigating.

19:35.968 --> 19:37.636
Now, I do my best
to roll with it,

19:37.845 --> 19:40.681
figure it
helps her get in tune,
psychically-speaking.

19:40.889 --> 19:43.016
If you say so, um...

19:43.225 --> 19:45.227
Right now, for instance,
the guy we're investigating
is a pathological liar.

19:45.435 --> 19:46.728
- She...
- Lunch is here!

19:46.937 --> 19:48.939
Finally. Did you get lost?

19:49.148 --> 19:50.899
I would've been back sooner,

19:51.108 --> 19:52.985
but the guy in front
of me in line had a
mild heart attack.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.863
I had to administer CPR,
wait for paramedics...

19:56.071 --> 19:59.158
He'll survive, but your
kung pao chicken may be cold.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.160
Then it would be small of me
to complain.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.744
Ballistics came back.

20:02.953 --> 20:04.496
The gun found
buried with Big Fish

20:04.705 --> 20:06.665
matches an unsolved murder
from last year.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.128
Popeye Collier. Dock worker.

20:11.336 --> 20:12.754
He witnessed
a Utopium shipment

20:12.963 --> 20:15.048
arrive from Hong Kong,

20:15.257 --> 20:17.801
was gonna testify against the
men from Mr. Boss' crew
he saw unloading it.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.052
He was killed in his home.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.721
Looked like
a professional hit.

20:22.431 --> 20:24.057
That's Terrell Johnson.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.476
Captured at the murder scene,
covered in Collier's blood.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.145
Ex-con.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.980
No weapon was found though,

20:30.189 --> 20:32.566
and there was
no gunshot residue
on Terrell's hands.

20:32.774 --> 20:36.778
I talked to Lieutenant Devore
who handled the Collier case
back when she was in Vice.

20:36.987 --> 20:40.282
She said they were sure
Johnson was the killer,
just couldn't make it stick.

20:41.950 --> 20:45.287
Terrell Johnson could be
a hitman working for Boss.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.164
If he's taken out
two of Boss' enemies,

20:47.372 --> 20:50.626
he's probably taken out
a lot more.

20:50.834 --> 20:53.587
Devore said Terrell
disappeared without a trace
after the trial,

20:53.795 --> 20:57.299
but... I've tracked him down.

20:59.384 --> 21:01.595
Terrell Johnson?
Seattle PD, we'd like to talk.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.597
Has this seemed
like the longest day?

21:11.897 --> 21:12.856
What do you want?

21:13.065 --> 21:14.149
You know this man?

21:15.567 --> 21:17.986
Name's Corey Carp.
Goes by "Big Fish."

21:18.195 --> 21:19.446
No. Why?

21:20.197 --> 21:21.073
He was murdered.

21:23.033 --> 21:26.036
The same gun that was used
as the Popeye Collier murder.

21:26.245 --> 21:30.332
You want to talk to me,
I'm gonna be needing
a lawyer present.

21:35.337 --> 21:39.383
- Any visions?
- No. But he sure felt
like our guy.

21:39.591 --> 21:43.136
I'm not disputing
that Bonnie and Clyde
are like family to you,

21:43.345 --> 21:47.432
but the IRS doesn't
allow you to claim pit bulls
as dependents.

21:47.641 --> 21:50.686
But I'm their sole provider.

21:50.894 --> 21:53.605
I know, but I always
advise my clients

21:53.814 --> 21:55.565
to stay on the
right side of the law.

21:55.774 --> 21:56.858
Hey, Boss.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.027
Our friend in the SPD
just called.

21:59.236 --> 22:02.406
Detectives working
the Big Fish case
like Terrell Johnson for it.

22:02.614 --> 22:03.490
They tracked the guy down.

22:03.699 --> 22:04.574
They do, huh?

22:04.783 --> 22:06.118
Want me to handle it?

22:07.911 --> 22:09.037
Where's Drake?

22:11.206 --> 22:12.165
You feel that?

22:14.251 --> 22:16.253
It's a tumor.

22:16.461 --> 22:19.631
It's not a toomah.
It's a muscle.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.967
You could have it removed,
but then you'd only have
a five pack.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.176
It's too risky.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.886
You're not
taking me seriously.

22:25.095 --> 22:27.264
You already told me
you're on hypochondriac brain.

22:27.472 --> 22:28.432
You should've
kept that to yourself

22:28.640 --> 22:29.683
if you wanted more sympathy.

22:29.891 --> 22:31.435
Blaine gives
all the best brains,

22:31.643 --> 22:34.271
the people with the fun obits,
to his paying customers.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.398
His hired help
gets the leftovers.

22:38.775 --> 22:41.194
I want you to be
careful down there.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.281
Blaine is selling Utopium
out of Shady Plots.
I'm sure of it.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.783
He's taking on Mr. Boss.

22:48.285 --> 22:49.828
You almost had me.

22:50.037 --> 22:52.164
Pathological liar brain.
I'm gonna have to be careful.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.249
No. This is the truth.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.500
You need to watch your back.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.510
- Major?
- Hey.

23:05.719 --> 23:08.722
You're not really
palling around with
Blaine, are you?

23:15.937 --> 23:18.106
What makes you think
I've been palling around
with Blaine?

23:18.315 --> 23:20.025
Well, it must've been
when he said you two
were BFFs now.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.861
Shh. My roommate's sleeping.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.446
What are you doing
palling around with Blaine?

23:24.654 --> 23:26.073
I'm not.

23:26.281 --> 23:28.825
Look, I'm taking
my grandmother
on a tour of cemeteries,

23:29.034 --> 23:31.703
- and surprise, surprise...
- You visited Shady Plots.

23:31.912 --> 23:33.330
So you do know
what he's up to.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.290
But I'm not palling around
with him.

23:35.499 --> 23:37.376
One of the weird, um,
"perks" of my job

23:37.584 --> 23:38.668
is that I get to know
just about

23:38.877 --> 23:39.920
every funeral director
in the city.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.255
You didn't tell me.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.049
Yeah, because I thought
you might do something unwise
with the information.

23:45.092 --> 23:46.760
Drop by the grenade store.

23:46.968 --> 23:49.096
Okay, look,
anything I might do to him,

23:49.304 --> 23:50.555
he'd deserve.

23:50.764 --> 23:54.810
No arguments here,
but you've gotta know
that he serves a purpose.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.520
He's in charge of feeding
Seattle's zombies.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.188
That's his gig.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.481
At least now he's doing it
without murdering people.

23:59.689 --> 24:01.983
- Okay. You need to move.
- What?

24:02.192 --> 24:03.318
He thought it would be
cute to mention that

24:03.527 --> 24:04.820
he knows here you live.

24:05.028 --> 24:06.780
Look, just a building

24:06.988 --> 24:08.657
with a doorman
and security cameras.

24:08.865 --> 24:09.908
He knows where I work, too.

24:10.117 --> 24:10.992
So...

24:11.201 --> 24:12.702
Oh.

24:12.911 --> 24:14.913
- You have company?
- Sorry?

24:15.122 --> 24:17.290
It seems like there's someone
moving around in your bedroom.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.042
Oh, no.
That's... That's my brother.

24:19.251 --> 24:21.253
Oh, really? So, uh, you...

24:21.461 --> 24:22.462
You two have
patched things up.

24:22.671 --> 24:23.964
Everything's hunky-dory.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.882
It must be if you're having
slumber parties.

24:26.091 --> 24:28.051
His buddy
dropped him off here.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.178
Evan tied one on,
and he's crashing here,

24:30.387 --> 24:32.848
so that he doesn't
have to face Mom
until he's sobered up.

24:33.056 --> 24:34.933
And you know he's allergic
to pet dander, so...

24:35.142 --> 24:38.353
- Oh, I didn't, actually.
- Yeah.

24:38.562 --> 24:41.148
And my roommate
is dog-sitting her uncle's
mini golden doodle.

24:41.356 --> 24:43.066
So cute.
The dog, not the uncle.

24:43.275 --> 24:44.901
Anyway, there's dog hair
all over the couch,

24:45.110 --> 24:47.779
- and if Evan
even gets close...
- Okay. Yeah, I got it.

24:47.988 --> 24:50.198
Long story short, I am
sleeping on the couch tonight.

24:50.407 --> 24:51.867
But I should get back to Evan

24:52.075 --> 24:54.828
because I was
just on a mission
to get his puke bucket.

24:56.288 --> 24:57.706
Thank you
for worrying about me.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.875
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.793
I'm sorry for swinging by
so late.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.254
Tell Evan hi for me.

25:09.301 --> 25:10.635
Sorry that took so long.

25:10.844 --> 25:12.721
Oh, it's no biggie.
Work called.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.140
G-Rad got attacked
by a drunk bachelorette.

25:15.348 --> 25:17.517
Girl nearly took his eye out
with a penis straw.

25:17.726 --> 25:21.605
They need me to go down there
and cover the door.

25:21.813 --> 25:25.233
How about dinner tomorrow?
I make a mean brain ziti.

25:25.442 --> 25:28.570
Yeah. Sounds great.
Wait. Is that another lie?

25:28.778 --> 25:29.696
Hand to God.

25:31.198 --> 25:32.741
I'll leave the key
under the mat

25:32.949 --> 25:34.868
in case you beat me here.

25:35.076 --> 25:38.371
And if you want
to bring another girl,
we can make it a real party.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.081
Cool.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.085
That last part was a lie.

25:44.294 --> 25:45.420
I know.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.386
You wanted to see me, Boss?

25:53.595 --> 25:55.388
You've been with us for about
a year-and-a-half now, Drake.

25:55.597 --> 25:58.475
You work hard,
but even better,
you work smart.

25:58.683 --> 26:00.977
I think it's about time
we gave you more to
do around here, huh?

26:01.186 --> 26:02.354
You ready to pop that cherry?

26:02.562 --> 26:04.898
I don't even need
to be sweet-talked.

26:05.106 --> 26:08.151
Terrell Johnson.
He lives at 555 Brooksbank.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.655
By tomorrow, that should
no longer be a true statement.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.615
No problem. What did he do?

26:14.449 --> 26:15.534
Does it matter?

26:15.742 --> 26:16.952
Not even a little bit.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.790
He took out one of our guys.

26:21.998 --> 26:24.709
Looks like he's
got it in his head
to settle old scores.

26:28.838 --> 26:30.298
<i>Everyone lies.</i>

26:30.507 --> 26:33.760
<i>It's a coping mechanism.
A key survival trait.</i>

26:33.969 --> 26:39.099
<i>Show me someone
who always tells the truth,
and I'll show you a weirdo.</i>

26:39.307 --> 26:40.809
<i>But maybe
the most dangerous lies</i>

26:41.017 --> 26:42.435
<i>are the ones
we tell ourselves.</i>

26:44.312 --> 26:46.356
<i>That boy you like?</i>

26:46.565 --> 26:48.900
<i>The one who gets shot,
the one who hangs out
with Don E. and Blaine</i>

26:49.109 --> 26:51.444
<i>and disappears
in the middle of the night.</i>

26:51.611 --> 26:54.406
<i>You've never seen his place
or met his friends.</i>

27:17.387 --> 27:18.680
<i>Babineaux.</i>

27:18.888 --> 27:20.181
<i>Clive, it's me.
I had a vision.</i>

27:20.390 --> 27:21.850
<i>Terrell was lying.
He knew Big Fish.</i>

27:22.058 --> 27:24.227
He did?

27:24.436 --> 27:28.189
Big Fish saw Terrell bent over
Popeye Collier's dead body,
blood on his hands.

27:28.398 --> 27:29.983
Big Fish could've put
Terrell away for murder.

27:30.191 --> 27:31.610
That has to be why
Terrell killed him.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.612
We should
drop back in on Terrell.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.405
I can swing by first thing.

27:35.614 --> 27:37.324
Great. I'll be ready.

27:37.532 --> 27:40.076
Oh, and Clive,
if you can, pick me up
a soy vanilla latte.

27:40.285 --> 27:43.705
There's this new study
that says caffeine helps
stimulate psychic activity.

27:44.372 --> 27:45.415
<i>Clive?</i>

27:45.999 --> 27:47.000
Clive!

27:56.301 --> 27:57.469
Hey, Terrell.

28:00.639 --> 28:01.973
Mr. Boss sent me.

28:02.182 --> 28:03.725
I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

28:13.902 --> 28:16.071
Mr. Johnson?
It's Detective Babineaux.

28:16.279 --> 28:19.616
- Mr. Johnson!
- The door's ajar.
Can't we just go in?

28:23.370 --> 28:24.996
Mr. Johnson! Seattle PD.

28:26.539 --> 28:27.499
Show yourself.

28:29.209 --> 28:30.377
Mr. Johnson!

28:35.715 --> 28:37.509
I'm gonna check the back.
Stay here.

28:58.947 --> 29:01.282
Liv. Come here.

29:06.996 --> 29:07.956
Someone left in a hurry?

29:10.583 --> 29:12.085
Check out this laptop.

29:14.254 --> 29:15.755
He was
researching flights to Mexico.

29:15.964 --> 29:17.841
All of them leaving
the first thing this morning.

29:18.049 --> 29:20.301
Looks like
our visit motivated him
to get the hell out of Dodge.

29:20.510 --> 29:23.430
An innocent man
doesn't hightail it to Mexico.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.181
I'll call Homeland Security.

29:25.390 --> 29:26.891
We should be able to have
someone waiting for him

29:27.100 --> 29:29.269
if he gets on
one of these flights.

29:29.477 --> 29:33.022
Ooh, I could do blood
dripping out of the corners
of your mouth.

29:33.231 --> 29:34.607
Make you even scarier.

29:34.816 --> 29:35.942
That's not really the object.

29:36.151 --> 29:39.738
A warning.
Your dad's still frozen.

29:44.659 --> 29:47.412
I guess someone's
gotta make an obligatory
popsicle joke, right?

29:49.330 --> 29:52.000
No? When did it get
so highbrow in here?

29:52.208 --> 29:55.712
Hey, this isn't
for my benefit, right?

29:55.920 --> 29:57.380
I still know
you're not a zombie.

29:57.589 --> 29:59.966
Ah, but it's only a matter
of time, though, isn't it?

30:00.133 --> 30:02.385
If we're on the same path
as Ravi's test rat?

30:02.594 --> 30:03.762
We might as well
get comfortable with it.

30:09.476 --> 30:13.730
Oh! They're so cute
when they're sleeping.

30:13.938 --> 30:16.441
So, I held up
my end of the bargain.

30:17.150 --> 30:18.902
You?

30:19.110 --> 30:20.862
Why do you think I went
through all of this trouble?

30:24.115 --> 30:26.451
Jeremy Chu. Our friend
in the fourth estate.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.661
Welcome to Shady Plots.

30:28.870 --> 30:31.790
Hmm, a funeral home.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.167
I should've known that's how
you were getting your brains.

30:34.375 --> 30:37.754
Well, how else
would one manage it?

30:37.962 --> 30:42.550
I appreciate your patience
in regards to our sudden
dearth in undead courtesans.

30:42.759 --> 30:46.221
Luckily,
there's always a few ladies
dying to join the team.

30:48.056 --> 30:50.391
- Well, hello.
- Hi, there.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.602
I'm Candy.

30:52.811 --> 30:54.729
There's a
Rolling Stones lyric.

30:54.938 --> 30:58.191
"You could make a dead man..."

31:01.903 --> 31:04.197
You see? Wasn't that easier?

31:05.365 --> 31:07.534
Now, for the real makeup job.

31:10.203 --> 31:11.204
Little help here?

31:12.872 --> 31:14.499
Where's the big zombie?

31:24.050 --> 31:25.885
<i>- This is Drake.
- Leave a message.</i>

31:26.094 --> 31:30.473
Hey, it's me.
I thought you were
coming over for dinner.

31:30.682 --> 31:32.725
Text me
so I know you're alive?

31:32.934 --> 31:36.187
Unless I'm being ghosted.
In which case that would
defeat the purpose.

31:49.909 --> 31:50.869
Ah, frack!

31:58.501 --> 32:00.503
Fish. You don't gotta do this.

32:14.893 --> 32:17.812
Hey. It's just me.

32:18.021 --> 32:19.731
I'm sorry
I'm getting here so late.

32:20.690 --> 32:21.649
I saw you.

32:22.609 --> 32:23.943
The night you were shot.

32:24.152 --> 32:25.320
You didn't tell me
the whole story, did you?

32:27.071 --> 32:29.574
You're an accessory to the
murder I'm investigating.

32:38.291 --> 32:40.209
So Don E. killed Big Fish,

32:40.418 --> 32:43.046
and Big Fish killed our two
would-be Utopium smugglers.

32:43.254 --> 32:45.465
Vic Parisi and Lonny Evans.

32:45.673 --> 32:48.384
And when Big Fish found out
that Don E. and Drake were
looking for their bodies,

32:48.593 --> 32:49.677
he tried to kill them, too.

32:49.886 --> 32:50.845
That's great!

32:51.054 --> 32:52.847
How is that great?

32:53.056 --> 32:55.391
Don E. is the killer
that Clive and I have
been looking for,

32:55.600 --> 32:57.560
but Don E. knows
all about zombies.

32:57.769 --> 32:59.729
And he shot Big Fish
in defense of my boyfriend,

32:59.938 --> 33:02.065
who, by the way,
helped bury Big Fish's body.

33:02.273 --> 33:03.441
That's obstruction at least.

33:03.650 --> 33:05.568
Okay. So not so great
on that front.

33:05.777 --> 33:08.571
But we know somewhere
in those Big Fish memories
in your head,

33:08.780 --> 33:10.114
you likely have
the information

33:10.323 --> 33:11.824
about where our
Utopium smugglers are buried.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.202
You just have to trigger
the vision.

33:14.410 --> 33:17.997
I know. That's why I'm meeting
Drake at his high school buddy
Vic's place later.

33:18.206 --> 33:19.415
He's gonna get me
in the house,

33:19.624 --> 33:21.668
and, with any luck,
the magic'll happen.

33:21.876 --> 33:22.961
What's the Missy Elliott song,

33:23.169 --> 33:24.379
"Cerebellum,
don't fail me now"?

33:24.587 --> 33:26.214
I don't think
that's how it goes.

33:27.966 --> 33:30.134
I've got an update
on the Big Fish homicide.

33:30.343 --> 33:32.220
Our guy Terrell Johnson?
He's on the lam.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.347
His passport and ID
were missing from his house.

33:34.555 --> 33:36.182
Most of his clothes
were gone, too.

33:36.391 --> 33:37.850
All signs point to Mexico.

33:38.059 --> 33:39.978
Hmm.

33:40.186 --> 33:41.813
Cops start sniffing around,
so he bought himself
a one way ticket.

33:42.021 --> 33:43.231
I'll put out an APB
and I'll...

33:43.439 --> 33:45.191
Homeland Security
can look for Johnson.

33:45.358 --> 33:47.276
He's not your problem anymore.

33:47.485 --> 33:50.446
Keep the coffee fresh
until another homicide
lands on your desk.

33:53.366 --> 33:54.993
- They're K cups.
- Clive.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.288
I just can't win
with that woman.

33:59.497 --> 34:01.374
Check out this Shady Plots
surveillance photo.

34:01.582 --> 34:03.626
It's blurry,
it won't hold up in court,
but it could be something.

34:05.253 --> 34:06.713
That's Blaine, obviously.

34:06.921 --> 34:09.674
But the other guy. Doesn't it
kind of look like...

34:09.882 --> 34:10.967
Major.

34:17.724 --> 34:19.726
I'm here. Where are you?

34:19.934 --> 34:22.228
<i>I'm so sorry, Liv.
I can't make it.</i>

34:22.437 --> 34:24.897
<i>I swear to God it feels like
I'm having an appendicitis.</i>

34:25.106 --> 34:27.859
<i>I know it's the brain,
but I feel like I'm dying.</i>

34:28.067 --> 34:30.903
<i>As soon as I'm on
another brain, we'll
drop by Vic's, okay?</i>

34:31.112 --> 34:32.071
Seriously?

34:32.280 --> 34:33.614
<i>Oh, God. Yes.</i>

34:33.823 --> 34:37.118
Okay. Feel better soon. Bye.

34:37.326 --> 34:38.244
<i>Bye.</i>

34:42.415 --> 34:43.291
Hello?

34:43.499 --> 34:44.417
Mrs. Parisi?

34:45.460 --> 34:47.170
I'm Amy Allen.

34:47.378 --> 34:51.257
I don't mean to bother you,
I was hoping to talk to you.

34:51.466 --> 34:52.508
About your son, Vic.

34:53.968 --> 34:56.137
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

34:56.345 --> 34:59.348
My boyfriend was a friend
of Vic's back in high school,
Drake Holloway.

35:00.308 --> 35:01.267
Drake who?

35:01.476 --> 35:02.435
Holloway.

35:02.643 --> 35:05.980
Uh, I don't know who that is.

35:06.189 --> 35:10.401
- Oh.
- But sometimes I think
Vic had a whole secret life.

35:10.610 --> 35:12.278
Oh.

35:12.487 --> 35:16.783
Well, uh, the reason
Drake suggested
coming to see you

35:16.991 --> 35:19.035
is I'm a reporter.

35:19.243 --> 35:21.746
I'm working on a story
for <i>Stars and Stripes</i>
about decorated war heroes

35:21.954 --> 35:24.582
who struggled to find work
upon returning home.

35:24.791 --> 35:27.627
I was hoping to talk to you
about Vic.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.378
Sure. Come on in.

35:32.381 --> 35:35.384
It's been nearly two years
since Vic went missing.

35:35.593 --> 35:38.346
Probably took me
about half that to admit
to myself he was dead.

35:42.558 --> 35:45.770
Do you have any more
recent pictures of Vic,

35:45.978 --> 35:48.981
maybe from his service
or after he got back?

35:49.190 --> 35:50.233
Sure.

35:53.903 --> 35:59.867
That's his platoon in Fallujah
and this one's from his
welcome home party.

36:00.076 --> 36:02.787
And here he is
with his best friend Lonny.

36:07.959 --> 36:12.004
- Please! You don't
have to do this!
- Arghh!

36:23.683 --> 36:25.560
He survived so much
over there.

36:25.768 --> 36:28.020
Lost his leg.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.898
However he died,
I hope he wasn't afraid.

36:31.107 --> 36:34.735
I hope it was quick,
and he didn't see it coming.

36:38.364 --> 36:39.532
I'm sure it was.

36:42.451 --> 36:44.662
Sorry.
I'm gonna go grab a tissue.

36:50.585 --> 36:52.211
<i>Hello.</i>

36:52.420 --> 36:55.715
Ravi, I know where to dig.

36:55.923 --> 36:58.217
He's buried by a swing set.

36:58.426 --> 37:01.429
I can't tell you
how badly we needed
this news right now.

37:01.637 --> 37:02.638
Why? What's wrong?

37:02.847 --> 37:03.931
It's New Hope.

37:05.057 --> 37:07.476
She died this afternoon.

37:07.685 --> 37:09.437
- So Major.
<i>- And Blaine.</i>

37:09.645 --> 37:11.731
They're on borrowed time now.

37:11.939 --> 37:14.066
We need to find
that one-legged corpse ASAP.

37:36.631 --> 37:37.548
Daddy?

37:38.466 --> 37:40.384
You've come back to us.

37:40.593 --> 37:43.804
After 50 years of praying,
here you are.

37:45.181 --> 37:47.058
You missed it all.

37:47.266 --> 37:50.603
The Zombie Apocalypse,
the Rapture,

37:50.811 --> 37:54.690
the Ginger Rapture,
the Great Floods
of '28 and '44.

37:54.899 --> 37:57.318
Blaine? Is that you?

37:57.526 --> 37:59.320
Quick!

37:59.528 --> 38:01.405
We've got to get you
out of here before
Dr. Zaius catches us!

38:01.614 --> 38:03.491
You see, winter is coming!

38:06.661 --> 38:08.037
Son!

38:08.246 --> 38:09.747
Please!

38:11.624 --> 38:12.833
Help me!

38:16.462 --> 38:17.421
"Please help me."

38:19.298 --> 38:20.800
Where have I heard
that before?

38:22.969 --> 38:25.137
I know. I said it.

38:26.514 --> 38:28.432
"Daddy, please help me.

38:29.642 --> 38:31.018
<i>" Frau</i> Bader beat me.

38:33.479 --> 38:34.772
"Please help me,

38:34.981 --> 38:35.856
<i>" Frau</i> Bader made me
clean the kitchen floor

38:36.065 --> 38:37.358
"with my tongue.

38:37.566 --> 38:40.611
<i>" Frau</i> Bader locked me
in a dog crate all day."

38:41.988 --> 38:45.866
You gave that woman
$100 million!

38:47.493 --> 38:51.122
I see.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.499
How long have I been out?
A few days?

38:54.709 --> 38:58.045
If Frieda
is getting all my money,

38:58.254 --> 39:00.089
that means
people think I'm dead

39:01.173 --> 39:03.509
and that I ,

39:03.718 --> 39:06.470
forgive my inability
to make air quotes,

39:06.679 --> 39:07.805
died mysteriously.

39:10.099 --> 39:14.854
And now your feelings are hurt
because I had the temerity

39:15.062 --> 39:17.523
to include a provision
in my will

39:17.732 --> 39:20.192
that has further evidenced

39:20.401 --> 39:24.864
the remarkable foresight
on which my company was built!

39:25.072 --> 39:28.826
You know,
someone should teach you
how to humblebrag.

39:29.035 --> 39:31.120
People might hate you less.

39:31.329 --> 39:34.498
And for what it's worth,
I didn't "kill you."

39:34.707 --> 39:36.751
I just negotiated
for your body.

39:36.959 --> 39:41.964
For this. This moment.
For the joy it gives me.

39:46.052 --> 39:48.346
Are you ready for your
close up, Poppy dearest?

39:48.554 --> 39:50.514
You're about to make
a new video will.

39:50.723 --> 39:52.183
No, son. I am not.

39:54.060 --> 39:55.019
Because I know you.

39:59.023 --> 40:02.193
You don't have the stomach
to do what's necessary.

40:04.070 --> 40:05.988
I guess we'll never know.

40:06.197 --> 40:08.783
You see, I'm gonna go upstairs
and have a sandwich,

40:08.991 --> 40:10.910
leave you with a couple of
friends!

40:14.622 --> 40:16.332
You might remember Chief?

40:16.540 --> 40:17.708
You had him shot in the face.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.628
Oh, and Candy.

40:20.836 --> 40:23.214
You tortured her,
cut off her fingers.

40:25.049 --> 40:26.467
Have fun, you guys.

40:26.675 --> 40:28.469
Come find me when he's ready
to make a new will.

40:28.677 --> 40:31.097
Oh, and avoid the face.

40:31.305 --> 40:33.099
We wanna leave him
camera-ready.

40:34.767 --> 40:35.935
Blaine.

40:38.938 --> 40:39.980
Son!

40:41.982 --> 40:44.276
Son!

40:55.121 --> 40:56.414
Right around here.

41:38.539 --> 41:39.498
Oh!

41:41.500 --> 41:43.502
Whoo-hoo. Whoo!

41:46.005 --> 41:46.964
Yeah!

41:48.340 --> 41:49.717
Whoo!

41:53.721 --> 41:54.722
Yay!
