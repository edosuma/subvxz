00:04.437 --> 00:06.638
- Happy birthday, Andy!
Go on, make a wish.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.774
- I wish to write

00:08.909 --> 00:12.644
a great Canadian novel
by the time I am 35.

00:12.779 --> 00:15.280
- And you will,
but don't say it out loud

00:15.282 --> 00:17.849
or it might not come true.
Where's your mother?

00:17.985 --> 00:20.852
Andrea! Boy's just about
to blow his candles!

00:20.988 --> 00:23.188
(moaning)

00:23.324 --> 00:25.457
- Rollie!
- You alright?

00:25.592 --> 00:27.859
- It's time!
- It's happening, is it?

00:27.895 --> 00:29.861
(screaming)
OK, I'm coming!

00:29.997 --> 00:31.863
I can't believe it!
I'm gonna have a new son!

00:31.998 --> 00:36.401
- Wait, Daddy!
What about my party?
And opening my presents?

00:36.404 --> 00:38.670
- Andy, you are just about
to get a new baby brother.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.707
Can't ask for a better present
than that! Dear God!

00:47.048 --> 00:50.883
For the new baby boy.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.955
(musical theme)

00:59.025 --> 01:01.426
(Rollie):
And for the record...

01:01.562 --> 01:06.131
Woah! Fifteen!
(laughing)

01:06.266 --> 01:09.034
- Dear God, Dad!
- Ah!

01:09.169 --> 01:11.303
- You guys eat breakfast
without me?

01:11.438 --> 01:13.638
- I knew I was
forgetting something.

01:13.773 --> 01:16.441
Go and have a seat, Andy!
It's your brother's birthday!

01:16.577 --> 01:18.844
- Finally, my boyhood
is behind me.

01:18.979 --> 01:21.046
- Yeah, well, you're still a boy
in my book.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.114
I mean, you do cry while
you're having your hair cut.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.383
- Well, they cut too much.
It's not what I asked for.

01:25.519 --> 01:29.721
It's never what I asked for.
- Are we forgetting anything?

01:29.856 --> 01:31.656
- Um...
- Uh...

01:31.725 --> 01:33.992
- Family gathering,
pancakes... Uh...

01:34.061 --> 01:36.394
Mark's birthday's stocking's up.
I don't think so.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.931
- It's my birthday too.
- Oh?

01:40.067 --> 01:42.234
- It's my birthday too.
Mark and I were born

01:42.369 --> 01:45.537
on the same day.
- No. You... You sure?

01:45.573 --> 01:47.539
Cause you seem more
like a...

01:47.575 --> 01:49.607
winter birthday boy to me.
- I think I know

01:49.743 --> 01:52.677
when my birthday is, Dad.
- I just think this is terrific

01:52.746 --> 01:55.481
Andy, would you like
some birthday pancakes?

01:55.616 --> 01:58.951
They're chocolate chip.
- I'm allergic to chocolate.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.619
- Really?
- What?

02:00.754 --> 02:02.488
- Like you're some king of dog.
- That's OK.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.556
I'll just take out
the chocolate pieces.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.425
It'll look like a hungry
little mouse got at them!

02:06.560 --> 02:08.527
- There you go! Problem solved.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.162
Right! We got to party
to crack on!

02:11.198 --> 02:13.765
Obviously, it was designed
just for Mark,

02:13.901 --> 02:17.102
but now it can be
for the both of you.
So that's alright, isn't it?

02:17.237 --> 02:19.838
- Yeah. That's... I guess.
- There's that joyless

02:19.840 --> 02:22.440
submission to fate
we've all grown to love

02:22.576 --> 02:25.677
and cherish.
Good lad! Right! Come on!

02:25.812 --> 02:28.313
Fifteen pancakes!
- Yeah, that was a lot!

02:28.448 --> 02:31.250
(chattering)

02:31.385 --> 02:34.986
- (all): Surprise!
- Oh, my goodness!

02:35.055 --> 02:37.756
- See? It's a surprise party!
- How long have you guys
been waiting out here?

02:37.891 --> 02:40.058
Cause we just had
like a full breakfast.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.461
- A very long time.
- You see,

02:42.596 --> 02:44.463
I missed so many
of your birthdays

02:44.598 --> 02:46.531
when you were growing up,
I just wanted to make up

02:46.567 --> 02:48.667
for some lost time.
Go and have a seat.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.002
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention!

02:51.138 --> 02:55.073
You can all take a seat, please.
Thank you for being here today

02:55.075 --> 02:57.142
to celebrate Mark's birthday.

02:57.277 --> 03:01.079
Oh, and as some of us have
recently discovered, Andy's.

03:01.081 --> 03:05.483
Now, the one thing
that these two boys

03:05.519 --> 03:07.619
had in common
when they were kids

03:07.688 --> 03:10.021
was their love of magic.
Isn't that true?

03:10.157 --> 03:13.892
- Actually, yes. Yes, it was.
- And so, with that in mind,

03:13.894 --> 03:17.495
I have hired a local magician
to astound us all.

03:17.631 --> 03:21.700
Please welcome Quantum
the Unyielding!
(applause)

03:21.835 --> 03:25.237
- Thank you! Thank you!
Hello, friends.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.505
I am Quantum the Unyielding,

03:27.541 --> 03:29.708
formally Quantum
the Spectacular,

03:29.710 --> 03:33.311
but recently changed due to
the darkest spell of them all:

03:33.447 --> 03:36.514
copyright infringement. Ha! Ha!
- It's a good joke.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.517
- Look at our two birthday boys
surrounded by their friends.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.120
You know, they say friendship
is the most valuable thing.

03:42.122 --> 03:45.857
But I think it's actually gold!

03:45.992 --> 03:49.394
- Oh, my goodness!
- Magic is real.

03:49.529 --> 03:52.531
- You know,
if you clean behind your ears,

03:52.666 --> 03:54.666
you could get rich!
- I will keep that in mind.

03:54.801 --> 03:58.403
- Your ears
also look a bit dirty,
but it's not gold back there.

03:58.538 --> 04:01.273
Hang on. What?
(all exclaiming)

04:01.275 --> 04:04.476
How did that get back there?
(laughing)

04:04.611 --> 04:07.546
- Oh, my goodness! Andy!

04:07.681 --> 04:10.082
- You were probably
saving it for later.

04:10.217 --> 04:13.018
- Aren't you a kids' magician?
- Oh, yes. I should clarify

04:13.020 --> 04:15.487
that I did select
the Quantum adult option.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.789
I think we're seeing
what that means!

04:17.924 --> 04:21.192
- You're God damn right.
- For my next trick,

04:21.262 --> 04:24.029
a classic with a deck of cards.
Please, sir,

04:24.031 --> 04:26.798
select a card.
- Um... There we go.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.268
- Memorise it,
show it to the gathered crowd.

04:29.403 --> 04:33.438
Replace it in the deck.
I shall shuffle the cards,

04:33.573 --> 04:36.108
place them here on this table

04:36.243 --> 04:39.911
and with but a snap...
Sir, check inside

04:40.046 --> 04:42.214
your jacket pocket
and reveal the chosen card.

04:44.585 --> 04:48.286
- What the...?
- Oh, my God! Ha! Ha! Ha!

04:48.289 --> 04:50.188
- How did that get in there?
- It's another dildo!

04:50.190 --> 04:51.989
- Yeah. This isn't mine.
This isn't mine.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.159
- No judgement, sir.
Nobody's kink shaming anybody.

04:54.228 --> 04:57.229
To each his own.
Right, everyone?
- To each his own.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.664
- It's not my kink, though.
I mean, it's not... It's...

04:59.667 --> 05:02.734
I mean, it's fine if...
- Now... for my final,
most spectacular effect,

05:02.869 --> 05:05.804
I will reveal
that at this very moment,

05:05.806 --> 05:07.939
this man has hidden
about this person

05:08.075 --> 05:10.275
an unfathomable number
of dildos!

05:10.410 --> 05:12.310
(laughing)
- OK. I'm done! I'm good.

05:12.346 --> 05:15.213
Excuse me, excuse me.
- Come on, Andy! It's funny.
Where are you going?

05:15.348 --> 05:18.116
- For a walk.
- Oh, Andy, come on, man!

05:18.185 --> 05:20.952
Don't do that! Oh, my goodness,
would you look at this?

05:21.021 --> 05:23.155
There's a dildo
right on his chair!

05:23.157 --> 05:25.624
Where he was sitting!
How did you do that?

05:25.759 --> 05:29.895
- Magic, dear friends, magic.
- What a triumph!

05:30.030 --> 05:32.197
(cheering and laughing)

05:36.102 --> 05:40.638
- You look like a fellow
with a lot on his mind.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.442
- Oh, I didn't see you there.
- Yeah, it happens sometimes

05:43.577 --> 05:46.177
Gotta work on my signage.
So what's wrong, friend?

05:46.213 --> 05:48.380
You've got a face longer
than an Austrian crescent.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.381
That's a type of potato.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.951
- It's my birthday today.
- Oh! Happy birthday!

05:53.086 --> 05:55.186
- Thank you! Thank you.
Actually,

05:55.222 --> 05:57.989
no one really remembered, so...
- Oh!

05:58.058 --> 05:59.991
- Yeah. Just once,
I'd like to be the center

06:00.060 --> 06:02.193
of attention in a good way,
you know, not the bad way.

06:02.328 --> 06:04.396
- Right, right.
Well, what's the bad way?

06:04.398 --> 06:07.065
- I don't know, people pointing
at me... laughing at me...

06:07.200 --> 06:09.668
- Laughing at you, sure.
- Pulling dildos from my ear.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.437
- Yeah, alright. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Is that... OK.

06:12.439 --> 06:15.473
Well, listen, man.
If, uh... if you want to talk,

06:15.609 --> 06:17.809
I'm here for you. But...

06:17.845 --> 06:20.512
Looks like someone else
might want to have a chat too.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.682
- What up? What up?

06:24.818 --> 06:27.519
Hey, man! You took off.
What are you doing?

06:27.654 --> 06:29.621
Buying some... potatoes?
- What are you doing here?

06:29.756 --> 06:33.391
- I brought you some cake.
- Is that chocolate?

06:33.526 --> 06:36.527
- Yeah, why? Oh, right.
You don't like chocolate.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.663
- I'm allergic!
- You're allergic.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.699
You're allergic, that's right.
Check out my new shirt!

06:40.701 --> 06:42.634
Dad got it for me.
Also, the scooter.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.637
I'm already learning
how to do tail whips.
You want to try it out?

06:45.772 --> 06:47.872
- I don't care
about your stupid scooter.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.174
Just leave me alone, OK?
- OK. Me thinks we're talking

06:50.210 --> 06:52.310
about more than just
the scooter here.

06:52.445 --> 06:55.580
- Yeah, maybe. Uh, I don't know.
- You don't get it!

06:55.582 --> 06:57.916
Up until I was four,
my birthday was just about me

06:57.918 --> 06:59.851
and then you come along
and all of the sudden,

06:59.986 --> 07:02.053
I have to play second fiddle to
Markie boy and I am tired of it!

07:02.189 --> 07:04.990
- That's not fair.
- No! I am tired of it, Mark.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.859
I mean, maybe if I hadn't been
shat on for 30 years,

07:07.861 --> 07:10.862
I could've mounted to something.
- Maybe you could've been
a contender!

07:10.997 --> 07:13.398
- You know what the truth is?
The truth is

07:13.533 --> 07:15.533
my life would've been better
if you'd never been born.

07:15.669 --> 07:20.004
- What did you just say to me?
- I said I wish you were
never born!

07:20.139 --> 07:22.139
- Wow! OK.

07:22.176 --> 07:25.744
Well, someone just talked
his way out of the cake.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.879
Ah, who am I kidding?
You can have the cake.

07:28.014 --> 07:29.914
- I'm allergic to the cake!
- Oh!

07:30.050 --> 07:32.149
Thanks, Andy! Really nice.
- Ooooh!

07:32.286 --> 07:35.554
(honking)
- Well, it's alright, son.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.089
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.759
- Dad? How did I get here?
Where's Mark?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.828
- It's good to see you awake,
Mr. Tennesen.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.764
How are you feeling?
- Where is my brother

07:45.899 --> 07:48.766
Where's Mark?
- Uh...Andy...

07:48.902 --> 07:51.136
You haven't got a brother

07:51.271 --> 07:54.139
Uh... What's a "mark"?

08:02.048 --> 08:04.916
with some dildos, please
just tell me.
- Andy,

08:04.918 --> 08:08.686
who are you talking about?
- Mark! You know, Mark.
Everybody loves him,

08:08.722 --> 08:12.123
he... doesn't have a job,
he just kind of floats
through life.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.525
- Andrew, please, would you
listen to what you're saying?

08:13.527 --> 08:16.528
How would this Mark
even sustain a living?

08:16.663 --> 08:19.397
What's more likely is
you really hit your head hard

08:19.399 --> 08:21.800
in that accident
and you're confused. Alright?

08:21.935 --> 08:23.802
Now, fortunately,
I have the cure right here.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.870
A loving father.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.806
Plus some pills
which I'll prescribe.

08:27.941 --> 08:32.244
- I'm glad you're alright.
I'll see you soon.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.715
Hey! You got me worried.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.884
(chuckles)
- Oh, pardon me.

08:39.887 --> 08:42.554
(sighs)
How are we feeling here? Um?

08:42.556 --> 08:44.489
Better?
- I'm fine. I just...

08:44.624 --> 08:47.158
You're that potato salesman.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.694
- Hey.
- What's going on here?

08:49.829 --> 08:53.098
- Well, you made a wish, Andy.
Remember?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.033
- A wish? When...
when did I make a wish?

08:55.168 --> 08:58.570
- You wished that Mark
had never been born.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.772
And here we are,
in a Mark-free world.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.641
Literally. The name Mark
doesn't even exist.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.011
You know who invented Facebook
in this world?

09:06.013 --> 09:08.513
- No.
- Huey Zuckerberg.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.648
- Huey?
- He looks the exact same.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.650
He looks... still looks
like a... kind of like a deer

09:12.786 --> 09:15.720
that wants to take your soul.
You know, with his eyes
way over here.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.689
- I don't understand.
Wishes don't come true.

09:17.824 --> 09:20.392
- Oh, they do on your birthday.
- No, they don't.

09:20.527 --> 09:24.195
- They don't. I'm just messing
with you. I'm an angel.
- Yeah. You're an angel?

09:24.330 --> 09:28.132
- And I am here to show you
what life would've been
like had your brother

09:28.268 --> 09:31.469
never been born. So let's just
pop those slippies on...

09:31.538 --> 09:35.006
and go on a little adventure.
But I should warn you, Andy.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.208
You may not like what you see.
- Hold on a second.

09:37.210 --> 09:40.145
So... God is real?
- Oh. Uh...

09:40.280 --> 09:42.881
Yeah, we're not gonna...
We're not gonna get
into all of that.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.884
Let's just say that I'm an angel
and we will leave it at that.

09:46.019 --> 09:50.722
- OK. Yeah.
- OK? Cool? Yeah. Here we go!

09:55.428 --> 09:58.162
- Is this my home?
- Sure is.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.099
- Ha! Ha! This is literally
out of my dreams.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.835
This is my dream home!
- Yeah, well, you designed it.

10:03.904 --> 10:07.705
But look closer and you...
you may start to see cracks

10:07.741 --> 10:10.642
in this perfect façade.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.044
- What are these?
- Um?

10:13.080 --> 10:16.114
- Are these literally awards?
- Oh, yeah.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.650
- Oh, my God, is this a Coastie?
The award for the best
Canadian novel

10:18.785 --> 10:20.852
from the east or west coast
but not the middle?

10:20.854 --> 10:23.187
- Uh... Sure. Man, I don't know.
Is that a real thing?

10:23.256 --> 10:26.191
Yeah, I guess that's...
Seems to be what it is.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.728
- That must mean
I'm a... published author.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.930
<i> The husks of harvests past,</i>

10:31.932 --> 10:34.532
by Andrew C. Tennesen.
I did it!

10:34.534 --> 10:37.135
I actually published a novel!
Ha! Ha!

10:37.270 --> 10:40.205
What a title!
- Yeah. Yeah. You wrote
a best-selling novel and yes,

10:40.340 --> 10:43.274
it's been optioned for a movie.
- Directed by Tobey Maguire?

10:43.276 --> 10:45.777
I didn't even know he directed.
- Yeah, in this reality,

10:45.912 --> 10:47.679
he got into directing
instead of acting,

10:47.814 --> 10:50.949
something about Mark being born
and the butterfly effect.
- Hold on a second.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.818
Molly and I are married?
- Yes.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.688
And that's actually
a great place to start,
because where is she?

10:56.823 --> 10:59.257
You know, why didn't she visit
you at the hospital? Um?

10:59.392 --> 11:01.625
Trouble in paradise, that's why.
And notice anything

11:01.762 --> 11:04.028
missing here?
In this little photo?

11:04.163 --> 11:06.297
Um?
- No Mark?

11:06.433 --> 11:08.699
- No Mark.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.569
Just to reiterate,
in this reality,

11:11.605 --> 11:14.639
your dear brother Mark
does not exist.

11:14.774 --> 11:17.976
This probably seems cool,
right? All of this?
- Yes! It does!

11:18.111 --> 11:20.411
- Well, think again.
I'll show you

11:20.414 --> 11:22.379
how uncool it is

11:22.416 --> 11:24.849
by taking you
to your party.

11:24.984 --> 11:28.186
- What party?
- Your first birthday party

11:28.255 --> 11:32.390
without your brother.
Yes, my friend.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.659
Yes,

11:34.794 --> 11:38.530
I'm referring to a party...
(clears throat)

11:38.665 --> 11:41.999
...without Mark.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.469
F---, dude, I was supposed
to do like a...

11:44.604 --> 11:46.805
- You... OK.
- One sec. Why the hell

11:46.940 --> 11:49.406
did I do that? I'm trying
to do like a magic thing.

11:49.543 --> 11:52.210
Without Mark. Goddamn!
One second. Once second.

11:52.279 --> 11:55.613
What did I do wrong? And... Ah!
- OK.

11:55.615 --> 11:58.082
- Angel power.
Alright. Alright.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.351
- Is it the turn?
Are you turning the right way?

12:00.487 --> 12:03.020
- Tut-tut. A party...

12:03.056 --> 12:05.690
I feel good about this one.

12:05.825 --> 12:08.426
...without Mark.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.629
- Wow! Magic!

12:11.765 --> 12:13.964
OK.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.700
- Enjoy your party, Andy!
- Hey, can I get a drink?

12:16.737 --> 12:19.904
- Not a waiter. Not a waiter.

12:20.039 --> 12:22.907
- Andy!
How's my favorite client?

12:23.042 --> 12:26.644
- Hey, Ruth! Client?
(laughing)

12:26.780 --> 12:29.581
- Good one! Ha! Ha! Ha!
But seriously,

12:29.583 --> 12:31.715

at other agents,

12:31.752 --> 12:34.118
I will sue you

13:02.081 --> 13:05.617
I should like to propose a toast
to my one and only son.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.386
There comes a time
in every parent's life

13:08.388 --> 13:11.956
when their child must pull away
and focus on his own life

13:12.091 --> 13:15.627
and his own career.
It can be humbling,

13:15.762 --> 13:18.963
it can be very sad,
or so I've heard,

13:19.098 --> 13:21.966

It's beautiful.
- And now, ladies and gentlemen,

13:53.967 --> 13:56.334
we have a rather large
carrot cake here,

13:56.469 --> 13:59.670
the best cake in the world.
Much better than chocolate!

13:59.805 --> 14:01.739
- Hey, birthday boy!
Let's get the party started

14:01.741 --> 14:03.775
if you know what I mean.

14:03.777 --> 14:07.212

14:19.492 --> 14:22.093

14:26.032 --> 14:28.900
Oh! Gee! Oh! God!
- Hey there, Andy.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.169
How's it going? You...
You looking for someone else?

14:31.304 --> 14:34.072
- Yeah. I was just... coming out
to see this woman that I...
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:34.074 --> 14:38.376
The woman who isn't your wife?
- It's not like I was gonna
hook up with her.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.045
- Oh, come on!
Yes, you were! I'm an angel!

14:41.114 --> 14:43.982
I know what you were gonna do.
So how's the party going?

14:44.117 --> 14:47.852
Um? Having a good time, Andy?
- Honestly, it is like the
best night of my life.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.821
It's incredible!
- Oh, it is? Yeah, what's
been your favorite part so far?

14:50.957 --> 14:53.758
Is it almost cheating
on your wife? Or maybe hanging
out with all those fake friends

14:53.760 --> 14:55.727
who only like you
for your fame and your money?

14:55.862 --> 14:58.262
- OK, sure. Fine. Maybe it's
not the best behaviour,

14:58.265 --> 15:01.399
but did you see my other life?
I mean, that's a requirement--

15:01.534 --> 15:03.801
- Man, listen to yourself!
You wished your brother

15:03.937 --> 15:06.537
out of existence!
- Alright, fine!

15:06.573 --> 15:10.040
It's not like I killed him, OK?
Just... He never existed.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.910
I mean, you could argue that
this is just an extension of
Kant's categorical imperative.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.980
You know what I mean? Like,
if you actually think about it--

15:16.115 --> 15:18.049
- Shut the f--- up! Shut up!
- What?

15:18.118 --> 15:20.084
- Shut your fu----- mouth
right now.

15:20.219 --> 15:22.019
- An angel can swear?
You're an angel!

15:22.154 --> 15:24.322
- An angel can do whatever
the f--- he wants always!

15:24.391 --> 15:26.724
I could kick your dick
across the moon, man.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.827

I do whatever I want!
- Fine, you can swear! OK!

15:29.829 --> 15:32.029
Congrats!
- And what I want

15:32.065 --> 15:34.966
is to teach you a lesson
about how much

15:34.968 --> 15:37.501
you love your brother
deep down and somehow,

15:37.637 --> 15:39.670
with all my power,
I haven't managed

15:39.739 --> 15:42.707
to get that through
your thick, thick skull. Pig!

15:42.709 --> 15:45.510
So, too bad, so sad.
We're going back.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.145
- No!
- Man, tbh,

I haven't had a lesson go
this south on me since Dahmer.

You give a guy one taste
of human flesh just to show him

15:52.185 --> 15:54.285

- I am not going back, OK?

15:54.420 --> 15:58.456

Now... Looks to me
like you got yourself
a big trunk right there,

17:23.143 --> 17:25.676

I mean, you could just put it--
