be facing an FBI inquiry,

39:09.420 --> 39:12.250

you're really thinking about

39:15.080 --> 39:20.040
is what happens now
between you and Alex.

39:20.040 --> 39:22.920
I'm not thinking
about that.

Hey.

39:51.290 --> 39:54.080
I've been thinking about when
we all first met at Quantico.

39:56.170 --> 39:59.330
We were such kids.

39:59.330 --> 40:02.040
None of us
knew who we were yet.
