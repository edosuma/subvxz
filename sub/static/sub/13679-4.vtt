BRADY: <i>That is the belt that was used</i>

00:05.336 --> 00:07.536
<i>to strangle David Morales
and is Cam wearing it.</i>

00:07.703 --> 00:09.509
You got to get Cam to
reconsider giving his DNA.

00:09.534 --> 00:10.504
I told you, it's a no.

00:10.506 --> 00:12.439
BRADY: <i>I need you to
test one of these hairs</i>

00:12.441 --> 00:13.607
against the blood on the SBK belt.

00:13.609 --> 00:15.209
You betrayed my trust.

00:15.211 --> 00:16.677
ALISON: <i>People were
transported to the hospital.</i>

00:16.679 --> 00:18.345
Tell me Hawthorne Concrete didn't supply

00:18.347 --> 00:19.246
that part of the tunnel.

00:19.248 --> 00:20.247
MARGARET: I've decided to sell.

00:20.249 --> 00:21.315
ALISON: <i>Tom.</i>

00:21.317 --> 00:22.616
You bought Hawthorne Concrete.

00:29.125 --> 00:30.291
Yeah, my father was

00:30.293 --> 00:32.026
a victim of the Silver Bells Killer.

00:32.028 --> 00:36.530
MARGARET: <i>Gunther Holzmann</i> had access
to both the belt and the work site.

Can you see who that is?

00:55.584 --> 00:56.951

01:01.656 --> 01:04.291
- It's your mother.

01:05.795 --> 01:07.027

01:07.029 --> 01:09.163
Ignore her.

01:09.165 --> 01:12.333
No, I have to take that.

01:12.335 --> 01:15.302
(sighs)

01:15.304 --> 01:18.906
Hey, Mom, what's up?

01:18.908 --> 01:20.241
Oh, my God.

01:20.243 --> 01:22.610
Okay.

01:22.612 --> 01:24.545
Right.

01:24.547 --> 01:26.146
Sure.

01:26.148 --> 01:27.548
I'm on my way.

01:29.017 --> 01:31.118

01:33.890 --> 01:36.657

01:43.265 --> 01:46.400
Deceased is Gunther Holzmann, 53.

01:46.402 --> 01:48.802
Hung himself with an electrical cord.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.405
Left a note, "I'm sorry"

01:51.407 --> 01:53.440
And you think he's the
Silver Bells Killer?

01:53.442 --> 01:54.808
Yes, sir, I do.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.745
Lieutenant, I'm happy to
take the lead on this,

01:57.747 --> 01:59.346
given Detective Ross'
conflict of interest.

01:59.348 --> 02:00.748
Gunther was the Hawthorne's landscaper.

02:00.750 --> 02:03.851
He was the handyman and
groundskeeper, actually, sir.

02:03.853 --> 02:05.319
Worked here for nearly 18 years.

02:05.321 --> 02:07.955
Well, 20, to be exact.
If I may, Lieutenant?

02:07.957 --> 02:11.125
My connection here is not so
much a conflict of interest,

02:11.127 --> 02:12.726
as a useful source of information.

02:12.728 --> 02:14.495
In fact,

02:14.497 --> 02:17.197
I found this photo in
the Hawthorne house.

02:17.199 --> 02:19.400
- When did you...
- The belt is clearly the same one

02:19.402 --> 02:21.602
that SBK used to murder David Morales.

02:21.604 --> 02:22.903
They found it in

02:22.905 --> 02:24.705
a bag of clothes the
family gave to Goodwill.

02:24.707 --> 02:27.007
Gunther was the guy who took it there.

02:27.009 --> 02:28.509
But not before he liberated the belt.

02:28.511 --> 02:30.844
According to one employee here,

02:30.846 --> 02:32.813
he secretly hated rich people.

02:32.815 --> 02:35.049
All smiles to the family, but apparently

02:35.051 --> 02:36.951
in private, Gunther could
get pretty worked up

02:36.953 --> 02:38.319
about the one percent.

02:38.321 --> 02:39.586
And he killed himself because...

02:39.588 --> 02:41.488
Well, SBK case

02:41.490 --> 02:43.190
is back in the news, he would've known

02:43.192 --> 02:45.459
that eventually we could trace
the belt from the tunnel

02:45.461 --> 02:46.827
back to him.

02:46.829 --> 02:48.896
My guess, he sensed we were closing in.

02:48.898 --> 02:51.532
Took the easy way out.

02:51.534 --> 02:53.300
No press.

02:53.302 --> 02:56.036
No word about this at all
until we're 100% sure.

02:56.038 --> 02:57.805
Yeah, absolutely.

02:57.807 --> 03:01.008
Oh, sure. When the
Hawthornes have some guy

03:01.010 --> 03:03.110
kill himself, a zillion cops show up.

03:03.112 --> 03:05.646
But when my cat gets his tail cut off,

03:05.648 --> 03:06.947
I get the runaround.

03:08.183 --> 03:10.784
It's all yours, Cutter.

03:10.786 --> 03:12.653
(indistinct radio
transmissions, car door closes)

03:15.123 --> 03:17.257
We should tell the
police about the bells.

03:17.259 --> 03:17.851
Tessa...

03:17.876 --> 03:19.626
It's obvious now why
they were in the shed.

03:19.628 --> 03:21.762
They were Gunther's, they weren't Dad's.

03:21.764 --> 03:23.263
We've got to tell the police.

03:23.265 --> 03:24.832
Absolutely not.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.066
What? Why?

03:26.068 --> 03:27.434
Tessa, the bells are gone.

03:27.436 --> 03:29.436
I had Gunther get rid of them.

03:29.438 --> 03:31.005
- Well, you didn't know.
- I didn't know what?

03:31.007 --> 03:33.807
That there was a Silver
Bells Killer on the loose?

03:33.809 --> 03:35.442
Of course I did, the whole world did.

03:35.444 --> 03:37.544
Now, at the very least,

03:37.546 --> 03:39.580
I'm guilty of destroying evidence.

03:39.582 --> 03:40.881
At the worst...

03:40.883 --> 03:42.449
who knows what the police might think.

03:42.451 --> 03:45.119
ALISON: I talked to the cops.

03:45.121 --> 03:48.088
You found him just... hanging?

03:48.090 --> 03:49.390
Yeah.

03:49.392 --> 03:51.158
Oh, my God.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.526
Are you both okay?

03:52.528 --> 03:53.660
(sighs)

03:53.662 --> 03:55.329
Okay.

03:55.331 --> 03:56.764
At least there's no press around.

03:56.766 --> 03:58.499
There probably won't be
until the police decide

03:58.501 --> 03:59.800
to make a formal announcement.

03:59.802 --> 04:01.468
- (scoffs)
- Tessa thinks that

04:01.470 --> 04:02.970
we should tell the
police about the bells

04:02.972 --> 04:05.506
- from the shed.
- What?

04:05.508 --> 04:07.274
No, no way.

04:07.276 --> 04:09.710
There is no reason to drag
us deeper into this mess

04:09.712 --> 04:11.045
when the killer is dead.

04:11.047 --> 04:12.846
I mean, who knows what the cops... no.

04:12.848 --> 04:14.081
No.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.550
It's nothing personal to Brady.

04:16.552 --> 04:19.553
But who's to say his
loyalty lies with us

What's the strategy for
this latest problem?

07:25.507 --> 07:28.275
I was just telling Alison
that the Gunther issue

07:28.277 --> 07:30.177
- might actually be a...
- No, not Gunther.

07:31.679 --> 07:33.914
(sighs) Could you give
us a moment, please?

07:38.086 --> 07:40.821
For goodness sake, Alison,
check your Google alerts.

07:40.823 --> 07:42.456
Do you remember the
woman who was injured

07:42.458 --> 07:43.790
in the tunnel collapse?

07:43.792 --> 07:45.225
She lost her foot?

07:52.066 --> 07:53.934
...and so today I have filed suit

07:53.936 --> 07:55.802
against the state of Massachusetts,

07:55.804 --> 07:58.672
the city, and Hawthorne
Concrete of Boston.

07:58.674 --> 08:01.008
They are all responsible
for what happened to me

08:01.010 --> 08:02.643
and must be made accountable

08:02.645 --> 08:04.044
- for their actions.
- Okay,

08:04.046 --> 08:05.879
so the company is getting sued.

08:05.881 --> 08:07.514
If a tunnel collapsed

08:07.516 --> 08:09.650
and chopped off my foot, I'd
be suing everybody, too.

08:09.652 --> 08:12.419
You are not appreciating the
gravity of this situation.

08:12.421 --> 08:13.754
The company isn't liable.

08:13.756 --> 08:15.489
I read the NTSB report.

08:15.491 --> 08:17.224
The collapse wasn't
caused by the concrete,

08:17.226 --> 08:18.392
it was the bolt anchors.

08:18.394 --> 08:20.227
Yes, but a lawsuit means discovery.

08:20.229 --> 08:23.363
And discovery means turning
over old records and files.

08:23.365 --> 08:25.866
Do you remember when I told
you I was glad to sell

08:25.868 --> 08:27.634
because of certain skeletons?

08:29.170 --> 08:31.705
We could be liable for millions.

08:31.707 --> 08:33.106
The company could go under,

08:33.107 --> 08:35.008
and I don't think I
need to explain to you

08:35.010 --> 08:36.977
about the effect this would
have on your campaign.

08:36.979 --> 08:38.679
Now, granted, this is

08:38.681 --> 08:40.113
a larger problem for the new owners,

08:40.115 --> 08:41.982
- but neverthe...
- Unbelievable.

08:41.984 --> 08:44.251
Tom is the new owner.

08:44.253 --> 08:45.619
Excuse me?

08:45.621 --> 08:47.721
Those Moscow investors
that bought the company,

08:47.723 --> 08:49.389
Tom put the deal together.

08:49.391 --> 08:51.892
Tom is now the owner
of Hawthorne Concrete.

08:51.894 --> 08:54.261
Oh, my God.

08:54.263 --> 08:55.829
What do we do?

08:57.465 --> 08:59.766
Make this lawsuit go away.

09:13.504 --> 09:15.270
I own the company now,
I didn't own it then.

09:15.567 --> 09:18.168
No, my father owned it then,

09:18.170 --> 09:20.103
and if you hadn't stepped in
to buy it behind my back,

09:20.105 --> 09:22.105
some massive conglomerate
would have scooped it up,

09:22.107 --> 09:24.074
and this whole mess would have
been their problem, not ours.

09:24.076 --> 09:25.308
Let's get this over with.

09:36.822 --> 09:39.489
what happened to you was awful.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.391
There's no denying that.

09:41.393 --> 09:43.460
It was a horrible accident.

09:43.462 --> 09:45.228
Um, you've suffered

09:45.230 --> 09:47.797
bodily injury and loss of mobility.

09:47.799 --> 09:49.566
Uh-huh.

09:49.568 --> 09:51.901
Now, we know in situations like this,

09:51.903 --> 09:54.838
the injured party will
file suit against, well,

09:54.840 --> 09:56.272
- everybody.
- But I can assure you,

09:56.274 --> 09:58.375
as the new CEO of Hawthorne Concrete

09:58.377 --> 10:00.910
that my company was
in no way responsible

10:00.912 --> 10:02.579
for what happened to you.

10:02.581 --> 10:04.047
Uh-huh.

10:04.049 --> 10:05.915
ALISON: That being said, we're prepared

10:05.917 --> 10:07.384
to offer you as a...

10:07.386 --> 10:09.619
well, as a sort of gift...

10:09.621 --> 10:10.620
The sum of $200,000.

10:10.622 --> 10:12.055
What?!

10:12.057 --> 10:14.090
- That was not the plan.
- Not your plan.

10:14.092 --> 10:15.592
We agreed not to try to low-ball her.

10:15.594 --> 10:17.560
You agreed, I didn't want
to give her anything!

10:17.562 --> 10:19.295
- Eva, I'm so sorry.
- 200 grand.

10:19.297 --> 10:20.630
Take it or leave it. Wait, wait, wait.

10:20.632 --> 10:22.399
Let's just stay calm here.

10:22.401 --> 10:26.036
We were prepared to offer you $500,000,

10:26.038 --> 10:28.505
but you know what? Let's
make it a million dollars.

10:28.507 --> 10:31.307
Contingent on your dropping the lawsuit.

10:32.143 --> 10:34.477
(chuckles)

10:38.315 --> 10:40.917
Wow, look at that.

10:40.919 --> 10:42.952
A little play, right in my living room.

10:42.954 --> 10:46.723
Bad cop and blonde cop.

10:46.725 --> 10:48.124
Listen, idiots.

10:48.126 --> 10:50.260
I lost my foot, not my brain,

10:50.262 --> 10:52.262
so here's how it's gonna be.

10:52.264 --> 10:53.997
I'll drop the lawsuit today,

10:53.999 --> 10:56.299
in return for $15 million.

10:58.736 --> 11:02.205
Or... you can just give me my foot back.

11:05.342 --> 11:07.110
She's savvier than we guessed.

11:07.112 --> 11:08.878
- What's Plan B?
- (sighs)

11:11.248 --> 11:13.216
(phones ringing)

11:19.056 --> 11:21.624
It's 3:15.

11:21.626 --> 11:23.393
Okay.

11:23.395 --> 11:24.794
I have an appointment with you.

11:24.796 --> 11:26.563
Since when?

11:26.565 --> 11:28.398
Since last night at the Hawthorne place,

11:28.400 --> 11:31.401
when you and a zillion cops
came over to investigate after

11:31.403 --> 11:33.636
Gunther hung himself. Why?

11:33.638 --> 11:35.705
To figure out who did it?
The dead guy did it.

11:35.707 --> 11:37.207
He killed himself.

11:37.209 --> 11:38.975
I solved the case, make me a detective.

11:38.977 --> 11:40.176
Okay, ma'am...

11:40.178 --> 11:41.678
Never mind that, look, I talked to that

11:41.680 --> 11:43.513
lady cop, and I was telling
her about Caramel.

11:43.515 --> 11:45.081
She said to come here

11:45.083 --> 11:47.317
at 3:15 today and talk

11:47.319 --> 11:48.318
to Detective Ross.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.619
She promised you'd help me.

11:54.258 --> 11:55.758
Great. Uh, great,

11:55.760 --> 11:57.861
why don't you take a seat?

12:08.205 --> 12:11.074
("Shave and a Haircut" knocking at door)

12:16.113 --> 12:18.314
(vigorous knocking)

12:23.954 --> 12:25.121
Where's Sophie?

12:25.123 --> 12:27.423
Hey, man.

12:28.559 --> 12:29.759
Uh...

12:29.761 --> 12:31.694
Who the hell are you?

12:31.696 --> 12:32.795
I'm Link.

12:32.797 --> 12:34.831
Like from <i>Zelda?</i>

12:34.833 --> 12:36.232
I sell dope to that little fiend.

12:36.234 --> 12:38.268
No, let me correct myself.

12:38.270 --> 12:39.736
It's only really selling

12:39.738 --> 12:41.271
when the other person
pays for it, right?

12:41.273 --> 12:43.706
Look, man, I have no idea

12:43.708 --> 12:45.175
what you're talking about.

12:45.177 --> 12:47.710
I'm talking about the
four grand she owes me.

12:47.712 --> 12:49.078
Four grand?

12:49.080 --> 12:50.947
Yeah, four grand.

12:52.283 --> 12:53.416
You got four grand?

12:53.418 --> 12:55.952
Uh, no, not on me.

12:55.954 --> 12:58.922
Right.

12:58.924 --> 13:00.290
Oh.

13:00.292 --> 13:02.392
Hey, hey, look, man, I really think

13:02.394 --> 13:03.760
you should leave.

13:03.762 --> 13:05.695
Yeah?

13:06.597 --> 13:07.997
Yeah.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.234
Okay.

13:11.236 --> 13:13.203
Whatever you say, man.

13:21.412 --> 13:22.812
Now you tell that little bitch

13:22.814 --> 13:24.647
I want my money by tomorrow night.

13:24.649 --> 13:25.848
(groans)

13:25.850 --> 13:27.450
PHYLLIS: <i>Can you imagine the pain?</i>

13:27.452 --> 13:29.852
His tail was cut off
and then sewn back on,

13:29.854 --> 13:31.287
and the Hawthornes did it.

13:31.289 --> 13:32.789
Why?

13:32.791 --> 13:34.157
Why would they do that?

13:34.159 --> 13:36.059
(sighs) They've always
been after my cats.

13:36.061 --> 13:39.195
Before Caramel, they almost
took out poor Toblerone.

13:39.197 --> 13:41.364
That idiot Gunther...
may he rest in peace

13:41.366 --> 13:42.699
while he's rotting in hell...

13:42.701 --> 13:45.101
nearly ran over him
on his stupid bicycle

13:45.103 --> 13:46.436
back in June '99.

13:46.438 --> 13:49.105
Luckily, Gunther veered
off and hit a curb.

13:49.107 --> 13:50.974
The paramedics made
such a fuss over him,

13:50.976 --> 13:52.742
rushing him off to Fisher Hill.

13:52.744 --> 13:55.345
Never once thought to ask,
"Hey, is the cat traumatized?

13:55.347 --> 13:57.447
What about the cat?"

13:57.449 --> 13:58.848
Hmm.

13:58.850 --> 14:00.984
Gunther was out of
commission for a few months.

14:00.986 --> 14:03.119
The Hawthornes had to
hire a new gardener.

14:03.121 --> 14:05.588
Killed all their hydrangeas.

14:05.590 --> 14:07.090
I'm sorry, ma'am, you'll
have to wrap this up.

14:07.092 --> 14:08.591
But I'm not finished.

14:08.593 --> 14:10.994
There was also a recent
incident of denture theft.

14:10.996 --> 14:14.063
Yeah, well, we'll have to
deal with that another day.

14:14.065 --> 14:15.765
(scoffs)

14:15.767 --> 14:17.800
Oh, you're supposed
to protect and serve?

14:17.802 --> 14:19.869
Well, you're doing neither.

14:19.871 --> 14:21.671
You're giving me the shaft.

14:23.407 --> 14:24.807
What is it?

14:24.809 --> 14:27.110
We have to get to Fisher
Hill Hospital right now.

14:27.112 --> 14:29.712
- Why?
- Because you might have been wrong.

14:29.714 --> 14:31.347
Gunther may not be our killer.

14:42.784 --> 14:44.978
We're in trouble, aren't we?

14:45.003 --> 14:47.403
Definitely seeing a pattern here.

14:47.578 --> 14:50.046
Contractor complains that the
concrete isn't up to code,

14:50.048 --> 14:52.381
cash withdrawal from
Hawthorne's business account,

14:52.383 --> 14:53.883
contractor complaint withdrawn.

14:53.885 --> 14:55.151
Doesn't take a genius

14:55.153 --> 14:56.752
to figure out what's going on, does it?

14:56.754 --> 14:59.355
No, and that's the fourth
payoff we've found.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.290
Way to do us proud, Dad.

15:01.292 --> 15:03.159
Yeah, I need a change of pace.

15:03.161 --> 15:06.696
(sighs)

15:06.698 --> 15:08.497
Safety inspection reports, what a breath

15:08.499 --> 15:09.832
of fresh air.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.600
You know, we need to fix this.

15:11.602 --> 15:13.736
If the business is exposed as dirty,

15:13.738 --> 15:16.505
both the company and my
campaign will circle the drain.

15:16.507 --> 15:19.175
Look at this.

15:19.177 --> 15:21.377
It's a safety inspection report,

15:21.379 --> 15:23.512
signing off on the exact area
where the collapse happened.

15:24.981 --> 15:26.115
So what?

15:26.117 --> 15:28.250
So look who signed it.

15:30.020 --> 15:32.221
(chuckles)

15:33.323 --> 15:35.057
Remember the good old days,

15:35.059 --> 15:36.692
before you were a corrupt mayor,

15:36.694 --> 15:39.362
when you were just a corrupt
public safety inspector?

15:39.364 --> 15:42.565
You signed off on the
tunnel that collapsed

15:42.567 --> 15:44.300
and injured Eva Tyler.

15:44.302 --> 15:47.837
The woman who's suing us, and soon, you.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.308
So... let's work together

15:52.310 --> 15:54.944
to shut her down.

15:54.946 --> 15:57.313
We both have oppo research teams.

15:57.315 --> 16:00.116
Why don't we train them on her,

16:00.118 --> 16:01.550
instead of each other?

16:01.552 --> 16:04.019
I don't love the idea
of teaming up with you.

16:04.021 --> 16:05.354
Oh, it's mutual,

16:05.356 --> 16:07.056
but play this out in your head.

16:07.058 --> 16:08.924
We'd both be screwed.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.760
If I'm going down, so are you.

16:11.628 --> 16:13.662
(sighs)

16:13.664 --> 16:15.831
I've told him a hundred times

16:15.833 --> 16:17.233
I'm gonna pay him.

16:17.235 --> 16:18.634
Yeah, paying him and telling him

16:18.636 --> 16:20.536
is not the same thing, Soph.

16:20.538 --> 16:21.604
- Ow.
- Sorry.

16:21.606 --> 16:22.538
Sorry, sorry.

16:22.540 --> 16:23.706
- Ow.
- Sorry.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.941
Come here.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.444
(groans)

16:28.446 --> 16:29.845
How you feeling?

16:29.847 --> 16:32.448
Like I just got the
crap kicked out of me.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.785
You really owe that guy four grand?!

16:37.587 --> 16:40.856
Look, it's my problem...
I'll take care of it.

16:40.858 --> 16:43.893
Sophie, where are you gonna get $4,000?

16:43.895 --> 16:46.095
(groaning)

16:47.697 --> 16:49.665
I'll find it.

16:51.301 --> 16:54.170
No.

16:54.172 --> 16:56.439
I'll get it.

16:56.441 --> 16:59.175
Okay? I'll get it, and I'll
pay that son of a bitch,

16:59.177 --> 17:01.410
and then I don't want you
going near him again, okay?

17:01.412 --> 17:03.279
You understand?

17:05.382 --> 17:08.117
I think I've got some Hydro in my bag.

17:09.118 --> 17:11.686
You want it?

17:11.689 --> 17:14.190
Yes, please.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.263
Hey, Mom.

17:22.266 --> 17:23.866
Hey.

17:30.707 --> 17:34.109
You know, in all the years
we've lived in this house,

17:34.111 --> 17:36.178
I don't think I ever remember

17:36.180 --> 17:37.947
sitting on the stairs.

17:41.485 --> 17:43.586
So, you gonna tell me what's going on,

17:43.588 --> 17:45.788
or do I have to drag it out of you?

17:49.459 --> 17:53.195
I don't think I want to
have a baby anymore.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.132
Okay.

17:57.134 --> 18:00.503
I mean...

18:00.505 --> 18:04.139
I do, of course, in theory,
want to have a baby.

18:04.141 --> 18:06.208
But...

18:08.512 --> 18:11.213
...what Brady did

18:11.215 --> 18:12.448
and his betrayal,

18:12.450 --> 18:14.149
I don't know. I'm...

18:14.151 --> 18:16.519
(crying): just having major cold feet.

18:18.655 --> 18:20.823
And I miss Dad.

18:20.825 --> 18:23.325
Oh.

18:23.327 --> 18:26.395
I know how much you loved your father.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.797
I used to love just...

18:28.799 --> 18:30.966
watching you look at him.

18:30.968 --> 18:34.169
You could see it in your eyes,
you thought he was perfect.

18:36.306 --> 18:38.574
He wasn't.

18:39.843 --> 18:41.343
But I loved him.

18:41.345 --> 18:43.913
You know,

18:43.915 --> 18:47.850
if you wait until everything
is perfect to have a family,

18:47.852 --> 18:50.019
then you never will,

18:50.021 --> 18:54.056
and there's nothing more
important than family.

18:54.058 --> 18:56.625
Nothing.

19:02.098 --> 19:04.099
So...

19:04.101 --> 19:05.935
give me my grandchild.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.503
(chuckles)

19:07.505 --> 19:11.073
I mean, the twins are
precious and Jack is...

19:11.075 --> 19:12.274
fascinating.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.409
(laughs)

19:13.411 --> 19:17.379
But I want a little you.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.793
Maybe we could sit on the
steps again sometime.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.630
No, this was it for me.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.665
(laughter)

19:37.934 --> 19:39.568
- Another one?
- I'm good.

19:39.570 --> 19:40.970
Thanks.

In the bar?

21:17.134 --> 21:19.568
You're an observant stalker.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.177
I'm a stranger.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.714
No, you're not.

21:33.583 --> 21:36.051
I mean, you saved my life.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.854
Right.

21:38.856 --> 21:43.258
I think I did a spectacular job here.

21:45.428 --> 21:47.262
Even though I was a little distracted.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.565
Why?

21:53.670 --> 21:57.706
You know, I'm the doctor, and
you're the patient, and...

21:57.708 --> 21:59.108
ethics.

22:07.484 --> 22:10.586
I just found out that they
got my father's killer.

22:12.255 --> 22:15.624
He's dead.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.793
There you have it, the
source of my happiness

22:17.795 --> 22:20.129
is death.

22:21.965 --> 22:23.599
How twisted is that?

22:26.703 --> 22:28.137
No judgment here.

22:31.241 --> 22:33.075
I figure...

22:33.077 --> 22:36.745
I'll come out and celebrate
with the basics.

22:36.747 --> 22:39.915
Some alcohol,

22:39.917 --> 22:41.350
cigarettes...

22:44.721 --> 22:47.356
...anything else that presents itself.

23:07.944 --> 23:09.945
(belt jangling)

23:09.947 --> 23:11.980
(unzipping)

23:11.982 --> 23:15.317
(moaning)

23:15.319 --> 23:19.221
Sorry it took so long for
me to process your request.

23:19.223 --> 23:22.124
Lot of records for Mr. Holzmann.

23:22.126 --> 23:23.992
Here it is.

23:23.994 --> 23:25.360
Gunther Holzmann,

23:25.362 --> 23:28.163
admitted June 18, 1999.

23:28.165 --> 23:31.066
Discharged six days later.

23:31.068 --> 23:34.436
Got out of his upper body
cast after nine weeks.

23:34.438 --> 23:36.839
Continued rehab into the fall.

23:36.841 --> 23:38.073
(sighs)

23:38.075 --> 23:40.008
- Nine weeks.
- We got the wrong guy.

23:40.010 --> 23:41.810
You can't strangle someone
when you're in a body cast.

23:41.812 --> 23:43.145
Was there anything else?

23:43.147 --> 23:45.781
Sorry, why are there so
many medical records

23:45.783 --> 23:47.883
for Mr. Holzmann? He'd
been in quite a bit

23:47.885 --> 23:49.518
because of his condition.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.954
And what condition is that?

23:51.956 --> 23:55.023
Mr. Holzmann had lung cancer.

23:55.025 --> 23:56.725
Diagnosed three years ago.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.627
He probably only had a few months left.

23:58.629 --> 23:59.795
(both sigh)

23:59.797 --> 24:01.430
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

24:01.432 --> 24:02.931
(sighs)

24:02.933 --> 24:04.900
Well, maybe that explains
why he killed himself,

24:04.902 --> 24:06.134
but I mean, the note?

24:06.136 --> 24:07.903
"I'm sorry""

24:07.905 --> 24:09.571
You know what I think?

24:09.573 --> 24:11.173
I think we should look into his family,

24:11.175 --> 24:13.675
his finances, see if there's
been an influx of cash.

24:13.677 --> 24:15.244
Why?

24:15.246 --> 24:16.712
All right, this is weird,

24:16.714 --> 24:18.046
and it's a long shot,

24:18.048 --> 24:21.583
but what if somebody convinced Gunther

24:21.585 --> 24:23.185
to take the fall for this?

24:23.187 --> 24:24.720
I mean, he's dying already.

24:24.722 --> 24:27.556
Somebody had enough money
to talk him into it.

24:27.558 --> 24:29.725
- "Somebody" being the real SBK.
- Yeah, exactly.

24:29.727 --> 24:31.660
Well, that means the Silver Bells
Killer is still out there.

24:31.662 --> 24:34.196
Yeah, and we're looking
for someone rich.

24:49.381 --> 24:51.416
Well, you look awful.

24:51.418 --> 24:52.817
Thanks, man.

24:55.754 --> 24:57.155
What happened?

24:57.157 --> 24:58.623
(groans)

24:58.625 --> 25:00.691
I got into a scuffle.

25:00.693 --> 25:01.893
You all right?

25:01.895 --> 25:03.261
Yeah, except I need to get

25:03.263 --> 25:06.364
four grand from Mom.

25:06.366 --> 25:08.232
And of course she'll
think it's for drugs.

25:08.234 --> 25:10.501
- Is it?
- No.

25:10.503 --> 25:11.903
It's drugs adjacent.

25:11.905 --> 25:13.304
Drug debt. Sophie's debt.

25:13.306 --> 25:16.140
Of course, I can't tell her that,

25:16.142 --> 25:19.110
so I'll spin some yarn
about why I need it.

25:19.112 --> 25:21.412
About 30, 40% chance she'll buy it.

25:21.414 --> 25:24.182
Stick around... be a real nail-biter.

25:26.919 --> 25:29.287
You look awful.

25:29.289 --> 25:31.322
That's what I hear.

25:31.324 --> 25:35.827
- What on earth...
- GARRETT: Mom, I need $4,000.

25:35.829 --> 25:37.728
- Wh-Why?
- Doesn't matter why.

25:37.730 --> 25:41.099
I haven't asked you for
anything in 14 years.

25:41.101 --> 25:42.700
(sighs softly)

25:42.702 --> 25:44.836
Why don't you just take
it out of whatever

25:44.838 --> 25:47.138
the old man left me in the will.

25:47.140 --> 25:49.173
(sighs)

25:54.146 --> 25:55.646
Make it out to cash.

26:03.822 --> 26:05.957
Are you at least gonna
tell me what it's for?

26:05.959 --> 26:08.159
It's for Cam.

26:08.161 --> 26:10.595
Be smart.

26:10.597 --> 26:12.363
Ow. Thanks, man.

26:13.799 --> 26:15.500
I'm taking this, too.

26:19.771 --> 26:21.672
I'm taking this, too.

26:26.879 --> 26:28.079
(sighs)

26:28.081 --> 26:29.647
Hey.

26:29.649 --> 26:32.316
Listen, um, I've been thinking,

26:32.318 --> 26:34.685
I just want to clear the air, okay?

26:34.687 --> 26:36.754
You know, you apologized,

26:36.756 --> 26:38.823
and I forgive you.

26:38.825 --> 26:41.259
So let's just move on.

26:41.261 --> 26:44.228
Uh, yeah, yeah, done.

26:44.230 --> 26:45.730
And...

26:45.732 --> 26:48.566
I say we go back to
trying to start a family.

26:48.568 --> 26:49.867
Tonight.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.669
T... Okay, great.

26:51.671 --> 26:53.237
Uh, is it the right...

26:53.239 --> 26:54.772
time, or, you know, whatever?

26:54.774 --> 26:56.707
No, but I think we should do it anyway.

26:56.709 --> 26:58.743
You know, just to keep our skills up.

26:58.745 --> 27:01.946
(chuckles)

27:01.948 --> 27:04.115
All right, if you insist.

27:04.117 --> 27:05.283
I love you big.

27:05.285 --> 27:07.251
Love <i>you</i> big.

27:19.565 --> 27:21.465
This is nice.

27:21.467 --> 27:24.468
Yeah.

27:24.470 --> 27:27.505
I never knew this place was here.

27:27.507 --> 27:29.073
How long have you lived in Boston?

27:29.075 --> 27:31.209
All my life.

27:31.211 --> 27:33.945
On and off.

27:33.947 --> 27:35.379
- You?
- I moved here

27:35.381 --> 27:36.981
with my father when I was six.

27:36.983 --> 27:38.516
Mm-hmm.

27:38.518 --> 27:40.885
My mother died when I was a baby.

27:40.887 --> 27:43.321
I'm sorry.

27:45.157 --> 27:47.358
Thank you, but...

27:47.360 --> 27:49.660
I don't know, it's not,
it's not sad for me.

27:49.662 --> 27:51.128
I mean, I didn't know her.

27:52.764 --> 27:56.167
My father...

27:56.169 --> 27:57.635
That was sad.

27:59.605 --> 28:02.273
Yeah. It almost destroyed me.

28:02.275 --> 28:05.610
You know, it probably had
nothing to do with you.

28:06.845 --> 28:08.913
What do you mean?

28:08.915 --> 28:11.449
Well, the killer...

28:14.453 --> 28:18.556
He probably wasn't thinking
about collateral damage.

28:18.558 --> 28:21.592
Never crossed his mind
that a 16-year-old

28:21.594 --> 28:24.829
was gonna wake up Sunday morning,

28:24.831 --> 28:26.831
head downstairs for breakfast, and...

28:32.371 --> 28:34.071
You found him?

28:35.274 --> 28:36.841
Yeah.

28:38.310 --> 28:41.045
Yeah.

28:41.047 --> 28:42.513
I don't want to talk about it.

28:42.515 --> 28:45.850
You do the talking.

28:45.852 --> 28:47.952
Uh, about what?

28:47.954 --> 28:50.655
I don't know, your baggage?

28:50.657 --> 28:51.856
I know you have it.

28:51.858 --> 28:54.392
It's written all over your face.

28:54.394 --> 28:56.494
(sighs)

28:56.496 --> 28:57.728
I'll get it out of you

28:57.730 --> 28:59.664
eventually.

28:59.666 --> 29:01.065
I will.

29:04.369 --> 29:07.338
Well, this is unexpected.

29:07.340 --> 29:09.573
Aren't you two competitors?

29:09.575 --> 29:12.677
Oh, we can always reach across
the aisle for the right cause.

29:12.679 --> 29:14.245
How is your...

29:14.247 --> 29:15.479
your injury?

29:15.481 --> 29:16.981
It hurts more than I can say.

29:16.983 --> 29:18.916
Although when it comes
time to tell the jury,

29:18.918 --> 29:20.184
I'll find the words.

29:20.186 --> 29:21.285
(chuckles)

29:21.287 --> 29:23.587
We're prepared to offer you

29:23.589 --> 29:25.523
one million dollars today

29:25.525 --> 29:27.758
- to drop the lawsuit.
- (scoffs)

29:27.760 --> 29:28.893
See you in court.

29:28.895 --> 29:30.594
Hold on. Hear us out, sweetheart.

29:30.596 --> 29:31.762
Oh, I can't wait

29:31.764 --> 29:33.497
till you're not mayor anymore.

29:33.499 --> 29:35.433
Not that I'm a big fan
of yours, Blondie.

29:35.435 --> 29:38.202
- (soft chuckling)
- See, we've discovered

29:38.204 --> 29:40.905
- a very, um, lively video.
- Mm.

29:42.240 --> 29:46.077
(slurred): Happy Birthday,
Lizzie, you whore!

29:46.079 --> 29:47.278
Mwah!

29:47.280 --> 29:49.580
Mm, what's the difference

29:49.582 --> 29:52.383
between Lizzie and a whore?

29:52.385 --> 29:55.553
(laughing): Oh, wait, I forgot my joke.

29:55.555 --> 29:56.787
(laughter)

29:56.789 --> 29:58.389
Love you, Lizzie!

29:58.391 --> 29:59.990
(video stops)

29:59.992 --> 30:02.626
Where did you get that?

30:02.628 --> 30:04.795
The Cloud, it rained.

30:04.797 --> 30:07.298
When that video was recorded,

30:07.300 --> 30:09.200
you were on probation for a DUI.

30:09.202 --> 30:11.402
And one of the conditions
of your probation

30:11.404 --> 30:13.304
was absolutely no alcohol.

30:13.306 --> 30:15.473
CONLEY: And in that regard,
the video speaks for itself.

30:15.475 --> 30:18.075
So if you move forward
with this lawsuit,

30:18.077 --> 30:20.644
your probation officer gets that video.

30:20.646 --> 30:22.413
And you could end up in jail, Eva.

30:22.415 --> 30:25.049
Which is not a comfortable place
for people with two feet.

30:25.051 --> 30:26.984
Oh, my God.

30:26.986 --> 30:28.919
So I get nothing?

30:28.921 --> 30:30.755
I lost my foot.

30:30.757 --> 30:33.491
The offer of a million
dollars still stands,

30:33.493 --> 30:37.328
but you have to drop the lawsuit today,

30:37.330 --> 30:40.498
and you also have to do one more thing.

30:43.034 --> 30:45.936
...therefore, I am dropping my lawsuit,

30:45.938 --> 30:48.806
and I am very, very grateful

30:48.808 --> 30:51.375
to Mayor Conley, Alison Hawthorne-Price,

30:51.377 --> 30:53.544
and Hawthorne Concrete of Boston,

30:53.546 --> 30:55.646
for agreeing to do whatever it takes

30:55.648 --> 30:59.517
to ensure that something like
this never happens again.

31:27.512 --> 31:31.449
How much time do you have
before your function tonight?

31:31.451 --> 31:33.117
I just came home to change.

31:33.119 --> 31:35.986
Well, isn't the first
step of changing...

31:35.988 --> 31:37.221
(unzipping)

31:37.223 --> 31:38.722
..taking off your clothes?

31:38.724 --> 31:40.758
(giggles)

31:49.067 --> 31:50.701
(giggles)

31:56.074 --> 31:57.608
What is this?

32:00.545 --> 32:01.812
Is this yours?

32:01.814 --> 32:03.013
No.

32:03.015 --> 32:06.250
Whose is it?

32:09.254 --> 32:10.588
It's Naomi's.

32:10.590 --> 32:12.957
Naomi was in here.

32:16.495 --> 32:19.230
You had sex with her.

32:21.433 --> 32:22.666
Yes.

32:22.668 --> 32:26.036
In our bed.

32:28.173 --> 32:30.941
Yes.

32:30.943 --> 32:33.410
Tell me more.

32:33.412 --> 32:36.447
(chuckles)

32:36.449 --> 32:38.549
Well, first,

32:38.551 --> 32:41.485
we started kissing at
the edge of the bed.

32:58.746 --> 33:00.996
Got some DNA news from Dana.

33:01.059 --> 33:03.559
I know. Gunther's not a match.

33:03.561 --> 33:04.694
Back to square one.

33:04.696 --> 33:07.763
(chuckles) A different DNA.

33:07.765 --> 33:11.901
The full workup on the
hair from your wife.

33:11.903 --> 33:15.104
I got to say, I was surprised
to hear she's Hispanic.

33:15.106 --> 33:16.539
You wouldn't guess it looking at her.

33:16.541 --> 33:17.907
What are you talking about?

33:17.909 --> 33:21.577
Hispanic female.

33:21.579 --> 33:23.446
That's what the DNA showed.

33:23.448 --> 33:25.514
Did you fake

33:25.516 --> 33:28.150
a DNA test to clear your wife's family?

33:28.152 --> 33:29.485
What? No!

33:29.487 --> 33:30.886
'Cause it sure as hell looks that way.

33:30.888 --> 33:32.922
(scoffs) Look, I just thought

33:32.924 --> 33:35.458
I'd give you a heads up
before I told the lieutenant.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.159
Cutter. Cutter.

33:37.161 --> 33:38.961
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:38.963 --> 33:40.162
Come on, look.

33:40.164 --> 33:41.397
There's obviously been some kind

33:41.399 --> 33:43.399
- of screw-up here, okay?
- Hmm.

33:43.401 --> 33:45.134
I know you don't like me, but you know

33:45.136 --> 33:47.703
that I wouldn't do something like this.

33:47.705 --> 33:50.172
You've got to give me some
time to figure this out.

33:55.846 --> 33:57.780
30 minutes.

33:57.782 --> 33:59.382
Then I see the lieutenant.

34:03.353 --> 34:06.122
I need you to tell Linda that
you screwed up the sample.

34:06.124 --> 34:08.623
(scoffs) No way. I don't screw up.

34:08.626 --> 34:10.126
Look, she thinks I did
this deliberately,

34:10.128 --> 34:12.094
to protect the Hawthornes,
and I didn't do that.

34:12.096 --> 34:13.829
- Just tell her the truth.
- I can't tell her the truth.

34:13.831 --> 34:15.297
She's not gonna believe me
if I tell her the truth,

34:15.300 --> 34:16.966
and that sounds like...

34:16.967 --> 34:19.135
Like Tessa was covering for
someone in her family?

34:19.137 --> 34:21.036
Yeah. So I'm gonna lose my job

34:21.039 --> 34:22.938
or my marriage or both.

34:22.940 --> 34:24.840
Dana, please. Come on. You
got to help me out here.

34:24.842 --> 34:26.007
My perfect record.

34:26.010 --> 34:27.275
(sighs)

34:27.277 --> 34:29.812
Dana, what do you want me to say?

34:29.813 --> 34:31.280
You can have anything you want.

34:31.282 --> 34:32.782
Just name it, okay?

34:32.784 --> 34:35.217
But I need you to go and
tell Linda right now.

34:38.054 --> 34:41.324
(groans) Two things.

34:41.326 --> 34:43.292
One, if it turns out your wife

34:43.293 --> 34:45.127
is connected to Silver Bells,
you've got to come clean

34:45.129 --> 34:46.395
and keep my name out of it.

34:46.397 --> 34:48.563
You got it.

34:48.565 --> 34:49.864
Second?

34:50.900 --> 34:52.168
A boat.

34:52.170 --> 34:54.203
A boat?

34:56.005 --> 34:57.673
What kind?

34:57.675 --> 34:58.974
I'll let you know.

34:58.976 --> 35:02.345
CONLEY: These are unreasonable demands.

35:02.347 --> 35:05.648
But my opponent wants to
keep coddling these unions,

35:05.650 --> 35:07.783
regardless of what it
does to the economy.

35:07.785 --> 35:11.587
Regardless of the effect it has
on our city's job creators.

35:11.589 --> 35:14.123
(laughter)

35:14.125 --> 35:16.025
Well, we're back to normal.

35:16.027 --> 35:17.993
Oh.

35:17.995 --> 35:20.196
You left this behind the other night.

35:20.198 --> 35:21.364
Oh, my God.

35:21.366 --> 35:23.132
Did Tom see this?

35:23.134 --> 35:25.868
Don't worry.

35:47.958 --> 35:50.559
I got the money.

35:53.130 --> 35:56.065
Oh, hey, man. No, we're cool.

35:56.067 --> 35:58.367
What do you mean?

35:58.369 --> 36:01.737
I mean, your girl came
by, and we settled up.

36:01.739 --> 36:03.939
Oh, Sophie gave you the money?

36:05.409 --> 36:07.643
I said we settled up.

36:07.645 --> 36:09.612
I didn't say anything about money.

36:17.287 --> 36:19.989
(groaning)

36:30.767 --> 36:32.034
SOPHIE: <i>Would you relax?</i>

36:32.036 --> 36:33.502
<i>This is not a crisis.</i>

36:33.504 --> 36:35.805
I'm a very sexual person.
I saved us money.

36:35.807 --> 36:38.441
You had sex with a guy

36:38.443 --> 36:40.943
to pay off drug debt.

36:40.945 --> 36:43.112
And you don't think there's
anything wrong with that?

36:43.114 --> 36:46.515
No. God, Cam, when did you
become so middle class?

36:46.517 --> 36:49.084
What is wrong with us?

36:49.086 --> 36:50.753
Are we delusional?

36:50.755 --> 36:52.288
Look at this place. Look at us.

36:52.290 --> 36:53.489
Look at our kid.

36:53.491 --> 36:54.790
He's like us. He's creative.

36:54.792 --> 36:55.958
He's different.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.893
He's demented!

36:57.895 --> 37:00.896
He stole dentures from the
old lady down the street,

37:00.898 --> 37:02.965
and stuffed them

37:02.967 --> 37:05.000
into a disemboweled doll.

37:05.002 --> 37:06.368
It's depraved.

37:06.370 --> 37:09.104
And settling debt with sex is depraved.

37:09.106 --> 37:10.206
Oh, yeah.

37:10.208 --> 37:11.640
And I'm depraved thinking

37:11.642 --> 37:14.977
that this warped little
family can even work.

37:14.979 --> 37:16.345
Yeah.

37:16.347 --> 37:18.514
Run!

37:21.485 --> 37:23.686
(sighing)

37:30.660 --> 37:32.027
I couldn't resist.

37:32.029 --> 37:33.696
I made a lasagna.

37:33.698 --> 37:36.398
Did you put someone else's
hair in your brush?

37:38.735 --> 37:41.437
Did you put someone else's hair

37:41.439 --> 37:42.538
in your brush, Tess?

37:42.540 --> 37:43.739
I told you my family didn't want

37:43.741 --> 37:45.040
to give you a DNA sample,

37:45.042 --> 37:46.475
Brady, I told you that.

37:46.477 --> 37:48.277
You were so mad at me for taking it,

37:48.279 --> 37:51.347
and you made me feel so guilty,

37:51.349 --> 37:52.648
and you planted

37:52.650 --> 37:55.117
- someone else's hair.
- Brady.

37:55.119 --> 37:55.986
What else are you lying
to me about, Tess?

37:56.011 --> 37:58.020
I'm not lying about anything.

37:58.022 --> 37:59.288
I was testing you.

37:59.290 --> 38:01.724
- You were testing me?
- I was testing you. And you failed.

38:01.726 --> 38:03.959
- I failed?
- You betrayed me.

38:03.961 --> 38:07.139
What the hell is wrong with you? I've
been trying to clear your family,

38:07.164 --> 38:09.164
because I thought they
were all innocent.

38:09.166 --> 38:11.267
They are innocent. It was Gunther.

38:11.269 --> 38:12.501
No, it wasn't Gunther!

38:12.503 --> 38:14.270
What-what do you mean?

38:14.272 --> 38:16.772
I mean that the DNA was
not a match for Gunther.

38:16.774 --> 38:18.240
I mean that Gunther was in the hospital

38:18.242 --> 38:19.408
during one of the murders.

38:19.410 --> 38:21.544
I mean that he is not SBK!

38:24.114 --> 38:25.614
Okay, I was wrong.

38:25.616 --> 38:27.249
I was wrong to put the
hair on the hairbrush,

38:27.251 --> 38:28.517
but you were wrong to take it.

38:28.519 --> 38:29.952
That is not the same thing.

38:29.954 --> 38:31.887
What I did was not illegal, Tess.

38:31.889 --> 38:34.990
What I did didn't
interfere with an ongoing

38:34.992 --> 38:37.426
criminal investigation.

38:40.030 --> 38:42.064
Let me tell you this.

38:42.066 --> 38:45.100
I am gonna do my job.

38:47.470 --> 38:50.105
And if Cam or Garrett,

38:50.107 --> 38:52.441
or anyone else in your family

38:52.443 --> 38:54.577
has anything to do with SBK...

38:56.680 --> 38:58.847
...I am gonna make sure

38:58.849 --> 39:01.317
that they go to prison.

39:04.554 --> 39:06.088
(door slams)

39:06.090 --> 39:07.656
<i>(knocking)</i>

39:18.268 --> 39:19.802
