00:01.400 --> 00:05.280
(Kurt) In a double bed,
silk sheets, candles, champagne,

00:05.280 --> 00:08.280
- soft music, with Clare.
- (Brian) Or?

00:08.879 --> 00:12.119
Or on the floor of
the staff toilet with Penny.

00:12.119 --> 00:13.678
(Brian) Penny.

00:13.679 --> 00:17.199
I'd settle for Clare
on the floor of the staff toilet now.

00:17.199 --> 00:20.199
- I'm off. I'll see you.
- Nine weeks.

00:20.920 --> 00:24.910
Nine fucking weeks
since I last had a shag. Unbelievable.

00:25.119 --> 00:27.399
- You know...
- Anyone fancy a drink?

00:27.399 --> 00:29.439
- I'm OK.
- I'm fine.

00:29.440 --> 00:32.659
I've got to get some sleep.
Bye-bye, children.

00:32.679 --> 00:35.679
- (All) Bye.
- Can I ask a favour?

00:36.040 --> 00:38.359
- Sure.
- Can I stay at yours tonight?

00:38.359 --> 00:40.719
The family I'm lodging with...

00:40.720 --> 00:43.879
It's a long story.
But I've got to find somewhere else.

00:43.879 --> 00:45.720
We're full up. Can't help you.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.358
- There's the floor.
- Which floor?

00:48.359 --> 00:51.359
In the living room.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.719
My room? He can't stay there.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.558
- Why not?
- I might...

00:56.559 --> 01:00.129
meet someone later
and she might wanna, you know...

01:01.199 --> 01:04.199
sleep with me.

01:05.080 --> 01:08.080
Nah.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.860
(Shutters clatter)

01:15.560 --> 01:18.560
(Groans) God.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.158

01:21.159 --> 01:22.719

02:26.639 --> 02:28.760
There might be something in it.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.720
Can you tell us whether Simon's
gonna have sex before Christmas?

02:32.720 --> 02:34.920
We all know the answer to that one.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.839
(Chuckles) Fuck off.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.599
How long's it been?

02:38.600 --> 02:40.599
Erm...

02:40.600 --> 02:42.638
is that any of your business?

02:42.639 --> 02:46.139
- (Kurt) Nine weeks.
- But multiply that by seven.

02:46.759 --> 02:49.159
- What?
- It's like dog years.

02:49.160 --> 02:53.240
So that means you've been celibate
for the equivalent of...

02:53.240 --> 02:56.240
- 63 weeks.
- What, you mean, no sex...

02:59.279 --> 03:02.709
Since Jenny?
She was the last person you shagged?

03:02.880 --> 03:04.678
Does it really matter?

03:04.679 --> 03:07.969
- It does to you.
- (Kurt) Nothing since Jenny.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.279
Oh.

03:09.279 --> 03:11.199
No wonder we run out of tissues.

03:11.199 --> 03:13.960
Didn't you give Maggie one
before you dumped her?

03:13.960 --> 03:16.158
- No.
- Prat.

03:16.159 --> 03:18.469
Maybe this is the curse of Jenny.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.930
Maybe every bloke she sleeps with
never has sex ever again.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.010
I have. I've had plenty of sex
since Jenny.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.160
Sex with yourself doesn't count.

03:30.919 --> 03:35.049
Morning. A reminder that
it's uniform and facial hair week.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.520
I don't want to see any students

03:39.520 --> 03:42.600
wearing non-regulation
clothing or footwear.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.839
Confiscate offending items
and bring them to my office.

03:45.839 --> 03:48.559
Carol will show you where to put them.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.439
Moustaches and beards
must be shaved off

03:51.440 --> 03:54.440
and I will want students
who flout the rules

03:54.440 --> 03:57.440
to be sent home to get rid of them.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.600
Sideburns...

04:02.039 --> 04:05.039
I leave to your discretion. Thank you.

04:07.440 --> 04:11.640
You know, I've never really
looked at Clare's arse before...

04:14.039 --> 04:17.039
Oh, shit, I've gotta find someone to shag.

04:18.119 --> 04:19.759
Lee,

04:19.760 --> 04:21.517
Martin,

04:21.519 --> 04:24.158
Robin, Anna...

04:24.159 --> 04:27.159
- Brandon.
- Yeah.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.440
- What's that?
- You tell me, sir.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.719
- It's a moustache.
- Well done.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.399
They're not allowed.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.359
Is that why you haven't got one, sir?

04:39.360 --> 04:42.319
I could... grow a moustache.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.320
(Bell)

04:47.480 --> 04:50.480
(Banging)

04:53.399 --> 04:54.899
OK, The Crucible.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.599
- Let's start at the beginning.
- Is there any sex in it, sir?

05:01.599 --> 05:04.319
- Is that important?
- You normally go on about it.

05:04.319 --> 05:07.259
- That's... That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

05:07.399 --> 05:09.840
Not today.
Today, we're gonna talk about...

05:09.840 --> 05:11.000
What?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
(Howling wind)

05:15.519 --> 05:17.678
(Bell)

05:17.679 --> 05:20.679
Sit down! Sit down.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.000
- That can't be right.
- It's the fire alarm.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.799
Is there supposed to be a drill?

05:25.799 --> 05:27.639
We ought to evacuate, sir.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.640
I know. I know.

05:30.679 --> 05:33.078
Where do we go?

05:33.079 --> 05:36.079
OK, come on, quickly. Move along.

05:37.959 --> 05:41.119
(Kurt) You've seen me
with a moustache, haven't you?

05:41.119 --> 05:44.519
(Brian) I've seen you with
some fluffy stuff round your chin.

05:44.519 --> 05:47.559
On holiday I didn't shave
for a week, remember?

05:47.559 --> 05:50.000
- No.
- I had a moustache and a beard.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.799
I was going to keep a goatee
but you said it didn't suit me.

05:53.799 --> 05:55.558
- (Siren)
- Are you sure?

05:55.559 --> 05:57.639
I thought it looked really good.

05:57.639 --> 05:59.760
No one looks good with a goatee.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.040
That's what you said.
That's why I shaved it off.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.360
I don't remember any of that.
I must've been pissed.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.360
- For a whole week?
- Yeah.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.399
Year 11's round the back.
You should know that.

06:14.399 --> 06:15.999
Oh, I do, I just...

06:16.000 --> 06:18.399
- Kimberley Sutcliffe's 3-1.
- Sorry?

06:18.399 --> 06:21.159
Kurt's taking bets
as to who's starting the fires.

06:21.159 --> 06:24.159
- Kimberley's a firm favourite.
- 3-1.

06:26.599 --> 06:29.599
Kayla, Kimberley.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.480
(♪ Bach: Toccata and Fugue in D minor)

06:40.360 --> 06:43.360
OK...

06:43.880 --> 06:46.880
Kimberley, do you know who I am?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.360
My name's Alec
and I'm here to try and help you.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.750
I'm what we call
an educational psychologist.

06:56.159 --> 07:00.359
All that means is you can talk to me
about anything you like

07:00.799 --> 07:03.438
and I'll listen very carefully.

07:03.439 --> 07:06.439
So, let's make a start, shall we?

07:10.200 --> 07:13.200
You were happy at your previous school.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.640
No problems there?

07:18.200 --> 07:21.200
So what's changed?

07:23.360 --> 07:27.770
Mr Steadman says you're always
getting into trouble these days.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.920
I didn't say that... exactly.

07:41.519 --> 07:44.109
- Is Clare in there?
- (Sighs deeply)

07:45.160 --> 07:48.160
Carol.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.010
- This is pathetic.
- (Mumbles) ..pathetic.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.158
What?

07:55.159 --> 07:57.159
Jenny.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.559
Oh, hi.

07:58.559 --> 08:01.238
- Alec.
- Alec.

08:01.239 --> 08:04.239
Of course.

08:08.399 --> 08:11.399
(Moaning)

08:14.559 --> 08:17.559
(Ecstatic moaning and groaning)

08:20.080 --> 08:22.878
(Animalistic orgasmic cries)

08:22.879 --> 08:25.879
(Climactic roaring)

08:27.440 --> 08:29.479
- What noise?
- (Susan) I can't do it.

08:29.479 --> 08:32.479
Was it like mmm-ha!

08:32.520 --> 08:34.399
No.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.530
A sort of moaning to begin with
like she was uncomfortable.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.158
Mmm-hah!

08:41.159 --> 08:42.719
No.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.118
Just do it now... quietly.

08:45.119 --> 08:48.119
It was...

08:48.479 --> 08:50.279
Ah...

08:50.280 --> 08:53.430
I really can't.
Anyway, you must've heard it.

08:54.039 --> 08:58.319
I'd have thought you'd remember
every detail of your last shag.

08:58.319 --> 09:01.679
Well, there was plenty of noise,
lots of action.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.280
All sorts of... groaning and stuff.

09:07.679 --> 09:09.478
Groaning. Mm.

09:09.479 --> 09:12.239
You really must know
how to satisfy a woman.

09:12.239 --> 09:13.879
Jenny seemed happy.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.319
- Who was the bloke?
- Was it a bloke?

09:16.319 --> 09:18.999
Sounded like a bloke.
Not that he said much.

09:18.999 --> 09:21.839
- Anyone we know?
- I didn't see.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.840
Didn't you stick your head
round the door?

09:28.120 --> 09:30.998
Mm. What do you think?

09:30.999 --> 09:33.999
- About what?
- My moustache.

09:35.519 --> 09:37.759
Can you tell I haven't shaved?

09:37.760 --> 09:40.760
- No.
- You didn't look.

(Kurt) A fiver says it's the piano tuner.

10:15.559 --> 10:17.199
Who?

10:17.200 --> 10:20.639
Jenny was talking to the bloke
who tunes the piano last week.

10:20.639 --> 10:22.400
That'll be who she's shagging.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.279
He's blind or deaf... or something.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.290
If he can't hear,
how does he tune a piano?

10:28.559 --> 10:32.059
Blind, then.
Maybe that's why he's so good in bed.

10:32.239 --> 10:36.039
- Who says he's good in bed?
- I think I can vouch for that.

10:36.039 --> 10:39.999
That happens when you lose a sense.
Your other senses get better.

10:39.999 --> 10:43.000
I don't think that applies
to sexual technique.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.119
Might do. Your eyesight
and knob are connected.

10:46.119 --> 10:48.479
- Do explain.
- Wanking makes you blind.

10:48.479 --> 10:50.918
That's true. Er, Simon...

10:50.919 --> 10:53.878
how many fingers am I holding up?

10:53.879 --> 10:56.159
Fuck off.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.598
Er, can I ask you something?

10:58.599 --> 11:00.359
There is nothing I can say

11:00.359 --> 11:03.359
that's going to help you
grow a moustache.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.038
Cheers.

11:08.039 --> 11:10.119
(Laughs)

11:10.120 --> 11:12.319
Have I missed something funny?

11:12.320 --> 11:14.358
Simon was telling this joke.

11:14.359 --> 11:16.199
It was fucking hilarious.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.080
- He's over there now.
- Then I'll stay here.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.279
Me too.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.280
(Simon groans)

11:24.720 --> 11:26.759
Ah, just ignore them.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.760
You don't think I try?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.798
Go and find a girl, talk to her,

11:32.799 --> 11:34.358
shag her.

11:34.359 --> 11:36.999
What, just... like that?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Yeah.

11:42.039 --> 11:46.029
OK, I'm a woman. You're a man.
We've just met in the bar.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.120
What do you say?

11:51.119 --> 11:52.839
Hello.

11:52.840 --> 11:56.340
Excuse me. Would you like
to have a drink with me?

11:56.400 --> 11:58.199
- No.
- Why not?

11:58.200 --> 12:00.879
That "excuse me" was too creepy.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.118
(Sighs heavily)

12:03.119 --> 12:04.560
Hi.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.000
Too cocky.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.879
- I don't suppose...
- Too nervous.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.880
Get your coat, you've pulled.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.760
Yeah. That's... perfect.

12:18.119 --> 12:20.358
What's happened to me?

12:20.359 --> 12:23.359
- The curse of Jenny.
- Yeah, could be.

12:23.880 --> 12:28.150
She's humping away every night
and I'm here... talking shite.

12:29.199 --> 12:33.329
Give it time. You just need
to sort out some opening lines.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.359
And some follow-ups.

12:36.360 --> 12:39.400
And then how
you're gonna take it from there.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.679
I'm never gonna have sex again, am I?

12:41.679 --> 12:44.679
You might. Just the once.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.679
I want it more than that.

12:46.680 --> 12:51.160
More than one person's going to fall
for your scabby old chat-up lines?

12:51.160 --> 12:53.518
It's possible.

12:53.519 --> 12:55.689
So what the fuck do I do, then?

12:55.839 --> 12:57.839
I don't know.

12:57.840 --> 13:02.180
Look, let's say you do find
some poor girl stupid enough or...

13:04.600 --> 13:07.600
drunk enough to get into bed with you...

13:07.960 --> 13:10.398
- Yeah.
- ..don't let her go.

13:10.399 --> 13:12.439
How do you mean?

13:12.440 --> 13:14.559
Well, if she's fallen for it once,

13:14.559 --> 13:17.640
there's a fair chance
she'll fall for it again.

13:17.640 --> 13:20.038
What, like a girlfriend?

13:20.039 --> 13:22.078
Exactly.

13:22.079 --> 13:23.579
- A girlfriend.
- Mm.

13:24.839 --> 13:27.478
You know, that's not such a bad idea.

13:27.479 --> 13:30.799
Even if I did pull,
where am I going to take a girl?

13:30.799 --> 13:32.678
Back to the Bates Motel?

13:32.679 --> 13:35.639
I thought you liked
living with Brian and Kurt.

13:35.639 --> 13:37.358
Yeah, I did.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.639
What are you going to do about it?

13:39.639 --> 13:42.160
- Move out, I guess.
- And live where?

13:42.160 --> 13:43.998
- Dunno.
- By yourself?

13:43.999 --> 13:46.160
- Maybe.
- With your girlfriend?

13:46.160 --> 13:48.599
Oh, no, I forgot!

13:48.600 --> 13:51.600
You haven't got one.

13:53.879 --> 13:56.520
You don't fancy sharing with me,
do you?

13:56.520 --> 13:59.279
Susan?

13:59.280 --> 14:01.558
Is that a no?

14:01.559 --> 14:04.559
(Low conversation)

14:05.680 --> 14:08.680
Will they talk about us
when we start shagging?

14:08.680 --> 14:11.239
- That's not gonna happen.
- Not me and you.

14:11.239 --> 14:13.199
I mean, if you get a girlfriend,

14:13.199 --> 14:16.039
are they going to discuss it
as much as Jenny?

14:16.039 --> 14:19.160
Yeah, if I get a girlfriend,
they may discuss it.

14:19.160 --> 14:23.150
And if I get a boyfriend,
they'll try to guess who he is.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.318
Unless it's one of them.

14:26.319 --> 14:28.440
Especially if it's one of them.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.279
Which one would it be?

14:30.280 --> 14:33.960
If you had to shag one of that lot tonight,
who would it be?

14:33.960 --> 14:35.200
If I had to...

14:35.200 --> 14:36.559
- Oh, God.
- What?

14:36.559 --> 14:39.569
It's like we're playing one of their games.

14:42.239 --> 14:45.239
We're turning into them.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.760
(Door slams)

15:03.759 --> 15:05.199
(Gasps)

15:05.199 --> 15:07.240
Sorry. Didn't know you were here.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.250
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't think anyone was...

15:10.760 --> 15:13.760
Er, sorry.

15:18.319 --> 15:21.319
I'd better...

15:26.560 --> 15:29.560
(Groaning)

15:30.639 --> 15:33.639
(Bed squeaks and groaning intensifies)

15:37.039 --> 15:40.039
(Orgasmic groaning)

15:44.399 --> 15:46.559
(Yelling and roaring)

15:46.560 --> 15:49.199
- (Roaring echoes)
- Yes, I'll live with you.

15:49.199 --> 15:52.699
- What?
- I'll move out and share a flat with you.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.879
But there are rules.

15:54.880 --> 15:59.850
One, no talking before or during
breakfast. Two, no talking about work.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.118
Three, no talking if I don't want to talk.

16:03.119 --> 16:07.679
Four, if you get on my nerve
you have to sit quietly in another room

16:07.679 --> 16:11.039
until I tell you it's OK
to come out. All right?

16:11.160 --> 16:14.160
- Yeah, yeah, I think so.
- Good.

16:14.679 --> 16:17.679
(Clinking on cup)

16:18.359 --> 16:21.038
Just to let you know...

16:21.039 --> 16:24.039
the person shagging Jenny is...

16:26.759 --> 16:29.159
Alec.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.078
(Brian) The Ed Psych?

16:31.079 --> 16:33.919
- He's only just got here.
- They met a while ago.

16:33.919 --> 16:36.919
Some residential course in Snowdonia.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.380
The words you're looking for
are, "Thank you".

16:46.919 --> 16:49.919
Fucking hell!

16:50.880 --> 16:52.279
(Alarm)

16:52.279 --> 16:54.840
(Simon) Would you say
he was good-looking?

16:54.840 --> 16:56.678
(Susan) Yeah. Why?

16:56.679 --> 16:59.759
I wouldn't have thought
he was Jenny's type.

16:59.760 --> 17:03.239
- Who says she's got a type?
- Everyone's got a type.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.719
What's yours? Female with a pulse?

17:05.720 --> 17:07.239
(Chuckles)

17:07.240 --> 17:11.118
Here's one. "Two bedrooms,
living room, kitchen, diner."

17:11.118 --> 17:14.199
- How big's the living room?
- It doesn't say.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.878
We'll need one at least 15 foot by 12.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.598
Well, that's massive.

17:18.599 --> 17:21.720
- You can't share a room any smaller.
- Says who?

17:21.720 --> 17:24.720
I've tried it. It doesn't work.

17:24.759 --> 17:27.759
(Simon) OK, line up now! Single file.

17:30.599 --> 17:32.839
You were gonna shave that off.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.850
And you were gonna grow one.
Oh, hang on...

17:36.159 --> 17:38.518
Coming along nicely, sir.

17:38.519 --> 17:41.519
- Only joking.
- (Kids laugh)

17:45.759 --> 17:48.719
- It's Alec, isn't it?
- Yes.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.720
I was just wondering...

17:53.079 --> 17:55.119
I think I need some help.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.398
From me?

17:57.399 --> 18:01.519
When I was their age,
I was too scared of my teachers to talk.

18:01.519 --> 18:04.519
Now he's arrived, they all laugh at me.

18:05.079 --> 18:06.579
At you or with you?

18:07.080 --> 18:09.718
At me. Definitely.

18:09.719 --> 18:12.719
- It's all down to Brandon.
- What's he done?

18:12.719 --> 18:15.078
He...

18:15.079 --> 18:18.079
pretended he couldn't see
my moustache.

18:24.319 --> 18:27.049
Is Brandon the only disruptive student?

18:27.679 --> 18:30.158
He's the worst.

18:30.159 --> 18:33.589
If he was in hospital ill,
that'd be all right...

18:33.919 --> 18:35.959
if he was off school for a while.

18:35.959 --> 18:37.880
You'd like him to be in hospital?

18:37.880 --> 18:40.158
Is that too much?

18:40.159 --> 18:45.199
Well, I... think you might have blown this
out of proportion just a tiny bit.

18:45.199 --> 18:48.199
(♪ Music cue)

18:51.000 --> 18:53.639
♪ Let me tell you 'bout
the end of the beginning... ♪

18:53.639 --> 18:55.119
OK.

18:55.119 --> 18:58.119
Armchair number one...

18:59.799 --> 19:01.358
here...

19:01.359 --> 19:04.359
at right angles to armchair number two.

19:07.599 --> 19:10.599
Not too close.

19:10.839 --> 19:13.119
Not too far away.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.900
You can... pass a packet
of crisps without getting up.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.960
- OK...
- This is the sofa...

19:23.039 --> 19:26.039
facing armchair one.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.958
Again...

19:30.959 --> 19:33.959
not too close and not too far away.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.838
Right.

19:36.839 --> 19:39.319
Do you think
I should rise above Brandon?

19:39.319 --> 19:42.318
- Physically?
- Alec thinks I'm obsessing.

19:42.319 --> 19:44.158
We got talking.

19:44.159 --> 19:45.958
- When?
- This morning.

19:45.959 --> 19:48.799
He made a lot of sense,
some good suggestions.

19:48.799 --> 19:51.799
- Such as?
- Avoid confrontation.

19:52.279 --> 19:56.479
(Giggles) It seems to me
you should show Brandon who's boss.

19:56.839 --> 19:58.918
- Really?
- Hm.

19:58.919 --> 20:02.489
I'll double-check with Alec
and see what he thinks.

20:05.959 --> 20:08.959
Just a moment, Ricky.

20:09.679 --> 20:12.158
Did you look in the mirror today?

20:12.159 --> 20:13.959
- Yes.
- Good.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.600
Then you must've seen
the bum fluff on your top lip.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.279
Some people might think
it's a sign of maturity.

20:20.279 --> 20:24.129
You and I both know
it just makes you look like a twat.

20:25.359 --> 20:27.179
I'm not being funny, miss,

20:27.360 --> 20:30.360
but you've got a bit of a tache yourself.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.999
(Brian) So you're gonna live with Susan?

20:38.999 --> 20:41.038
- Yeah.
- Like a couple?

20:41.039 --> 20:43.240
- No.
- Think you'll see her naked?

20:43.240 --> 20:44.719
- No.
- You might.

20:44.719 --> 20:46.480
That's not why I'm doing this.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.839
- Don't you fancy her?
- Don't think so.

20:48.839 --> 20:51.678
- Why not? She's a woman.
- She's Susan.

20:51.679 --> 20:53.960
It'd make a lot of sense if you did.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.960
She'd be in your flat.
You could try and shag her.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.040
- It's Susan.
- You are desperate.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.120
- That's true.
- And she's pretty fit.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.799
Even if you don't fancy her,
you could still shag her. I would.

21:04.799 --> 21:07.240
- I won't have to chat her up.
- No need.

21:07.240 --> 21:11.039
Maybe I could make myself fancy her...
if I made an effort.

21:11.039 --> 21:14.039
(♪ Romantic waltz)

21:15.199 --> 21:18.199
(Birdsong)

21:28.199 --> 21:31.199
Do you think I've got a moustache?

21:36.399 --> 21:40.529
Two bedrooms, living room, kitchen,
use of communal garden.

21:43.559 --> 21:46.558
You can see it, can't you?

21:46.559 --> 21:48.000
What's wrong?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.279
You know in this light from here,

21:50.279 --> 21:53.279
- you don't look too bad.
- I'm sorry?

21:53.359 --> 21:55.399
I mean, you're not unattractive.

21:55.399 --> 21:58.960
Objectively, you've got
all the bits in the right place,

21:58.960 --> 22:01.960
and your face, well, it's... OK, isn't it?

22:03.640 --> 22:06.640
- Is it?
- Shiny hair, nose not too big,

22:07.159 --> 22:09.078
lips...

22:09.079 --> 22:11.319
under the nose, and your eyes...

22:12.719 --> 22:16.919
bit bloodshot maybe
but nothing an early night couldn't fix.

22:18.399 --> 22:20.439
Finished?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.958
(Mouths)

22:22.959 --> 22:25.959
Good.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.600
So, how about this flat? Should we...?

22:30.600 --> 22:32.639
Wear skirts more often. They suit you.

22:32.639 --> 22:36.400
My mum thinks Kimberley
should get an individual action plan.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.840
Oh, really?

22:37.840 --> 22:41.279
She thinks the system's
let her down - and you have.

22:41.279 --> 22:44.480
I don't care what
your mum thinks about anything.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.480
Good afternoon, Mr Steadman.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.479
It would be tricky enough
if she was just another student

22:55.479 --> 22:58.799
- but her mum works here...
- Who are we talking about?

22:58.799 --> 23:01.399
- Kayla.
- I haven't got time for this.

23:01.399 --> 23:04.689
- You found time for Kurt.
- Kurt's got issues.

23:04.919 --> 23:07.919
I've got issues! Well, one issue. Kayla.

23:08.559 --> 23:10.638
A 12-year-old girl?

23:10.639 --> 23:14.699
She might be 12 on paper.
It's like she's 25 in real life.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.119
Why 25?

23:17.120 --> 23:19.120
It's a bigger number than 12.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.680
- So why pick on that age?
- It's just a random number.

23:22.680 --> 23:26.600
The point is, Kayla's a little bastard
who's doing my head in.

23:26.600 --> 23:30.959
No, the point is she's a schoolgirl
and you're a grown-up teacher.

23:30.959 --> 23:33.959
Supposedly.

23:34.399 --> 23:37.399
(Water pouring)

23:42.279 --> 23:45.840
- Why doesn't he talk to me?
- He wants professional help.

23:45.840 --> 23:48.840
- What am I?
- A teacher.

23:55.039 --> 23:57.359
For God's sake, I'm going to bleach it.

23:57.359 --> 24:00.519
- I wasn't...
- Do you want to give me a complex?

24:00.519 --> 24:03.278
No, I was just thinking.

24:03.279 --> 24:06.279
About?

24:06.519 --> 24:09.519
Whether I want a biscuit or not.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.240
You will let me know, won't you?

24:22.840 --> 24:25.159
Are you sure
they haven't shagged before?

24:25.159 --> 24:28.359
- He says they didn't.
- They went to college together.

24:28.359 --> 24:31.119
Maybe they tried but it didn't work out.

24:31.119 --> 24:34.119
- Why not?
- Maybe she's deformed.

24:34.839 --> 24:36.959
Maybe she's got a third nipple.

24:36.959 --> 24:40.599
A big, fucking purple nodule
in the middle of her chest.

24:40.599 --> 24:43.719
Simon couldn't even look at it
let alone touch it.

24:43.719 --> 24:46.439
Yeah, that's possible.
Why don't you ask him?

24:46.439 --> 24:50.149
No, he's probably spent years
trying to block it out.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.360
Have you tried getting drunk with her?

24:53.360 --> 24:55.439
I do that down the pub every night.

24:55.439 --> 24:59.709
No, I mean just the two of you
across a table somewhere dark.

24:59.879 --> 25:03.839
You drink lots of wine
and then stick your face close to hers.

25:03.839 --> 25:07.199
She goes blurry
and your mind starts playing tricks -

25:07.199 --> 25:10.279
she's the most beautiful woman
in the world.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.318
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

25:12.319 --> 25:15.539
You won't even remember
about her deformities.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.878
If she's got any.

25:18.879 --> 25:21.638
Works every time.

25:21.639 --> 25:23.279
Yeah, sounds good.

25:23.280 --> 25:26.280
(Susan) Simon! Simon!

25:26.640 --> 25:29.039
I found one. Ten minutes from school

25:29.039 --> 25:32.469
big garden, not too expensive.
What do you think?

25:34.359 --> 25:36.398
What do you think?

25:36.399 --> 25:39.399
How big's the living room?

25:41.359 --> 25:44.359
(Chuckling)

25:47.559 --> 25:49.198
Can I, er...

25:49.199 --> 25:52.079
- come back to yours for a bit?
- What for?

25:52.079 --> 25:55.509
I, er... thought it might be nice
to have a chat.

25:55.919 --> 25:58.919
A chat? About what?

25:59.320 --> 26:01.760
- You think Alec will be there.
- Eh?

26:01.760 --> 26:06.030
You want to hear them shagging
and hear Jenny make her noise.

26:07.319 --> 26:08.819
Yeah, that's right.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.359
- Pervert.
- Me?

26:11.360 --> 26:13.720
You're the one who listens every night.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.119
I don't go round impersonating Jenny.

26:16.119 --> 26:17.839
- I won't stay for long.
- No.

26:17.839 --> 26:18.959
- Half an hour.
- No.

26:18.959 --> 26:20.479
Ten minutes.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.078
Ten minutes?

26:22.079 --> 26:25.079
No.

26:32.279 --> 26:35.279
(Birdsong)

26:49.920 --> 26:52.639
- What are you doing here?
- Eh?

26:52.640 --> 26:55.320
I couldn't stay at my place
so I came round.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.518
Fucking hell!

26:57.519 --> 27:00.519
♪ So what about me?
♪ I can't take it

27:02.519 --> 27:05.519
♪ What I wanna be
♪ I won't make it

27:06.759 --> 27:09.759
♪ What about me?
♪ I can't take it

27:10.999 --> 27:13.999
♪ Hear me when I speak
♪ I won't make it

27:16.600 --> 27:19.680
♪ But sometimes I feel it
You know how it is

27:20.800 --> 27:24.160
♪ You wake up in the morning

♪ I'm still hoping tomorrow feels like this

27:29.559 --> 27:31.719

27:31.720 --> 27:33.919
Alec, have you got five minutes?

27:33.919 --> 27:36.919
- Now?
- Yeah.

27:37.280 --> 27:40.280
OK.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.040
(Alarm)

27:47.040 --> 27:49.079
(Simon sighs)

27:49.080 --> 27:52.920
(Simon) I can look at her
and I can see she's beautiful.

27:52.920 --> 27:56.770
Objectively, there's no doubt about it.
She's gorgeous.

27:56.879 --> 27:59.320
- (Siren)
- So how come I don't fancy her?

27:59.320 --> 28:01.678
You tell me.

28:01.679 --> 28:04.319
I can't, can I?
That's why I'm asking you.

28:04.319 --> 28:07.319
You're asking me what exactly?

28:07.440 --> 28:09.479
Why can't I fancy Susan?

28:09.480 --> 28:11.479
I wanna...

28:11.480 --> 28:13.198
want her.

28:13.199 --> 28:16.629
To be honest,
I don't think you've got a problem.

28:16.639 --> 28:18.680
But I just told you. I can't...

28:18.680 --> 28:22.040
Make myself fancy Susan.
Yeah, you've said that.

28:22.079 --> 28:24.279
Several times.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.199
But how is that a problem?

28:26.200 --> 28:30.540
Susan's not your wife or even your lover.
She's just a friend.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.680
Do you think you should
fancy all your friends?

28:34.680 --> 28:37.439
Do you think
there's something wrong with you

28:37.439 --> 28:40.559
because you're not
physically aroused by someone

28:40.559 --> 28:43.639
with whom you enjoy
a Platonic relationship?

28:44.680 --> 28:47.680
You just don't get it, do you?

28:52.840 --> 28:55.919
I hope you don't mind
but I'm going to move out.

28:55.919 --> 28:57.479
Oh.

28:57.480 --> 29:01.039
I'm moving in with Simon.
And yes, I know what I'm doing.

29:01.039 --> 29:04.159
And no, I can't think
of anyone else to share with.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.879
How sad am I?

29:05.880 --> 29:09.450
Don't be silly.
I'm sure it'll be... an experience.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.039
Thanks for letting me stay.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.439
- I enjoyed it.
- So did I.

29:14.440 --> 29:17.079
But it was only supposed
to be temporary.

29:17.079 --> 29:18.619
- I guess so.
- And...

29:20.360 --> 29:23.278
Well, no, it doesn't matter.

29:23.279 --> 29:26.118
- What doesn't matter?
- Not important.

29:26.119 --> 29:29.119
- What?
- (Sighs heavily)

29:39.320 --> 29:42.320
(Orgasmic groaning)

29:45.119 --> 29:48.119
(Groaning intensifies)

29:48.200 --> 29:49.918
(Animalistic cries)

29:49.919 --> 29:52.919
(Machine clicks off)

29:56.559 --> 29:59.278
Are you sure that's me?

29:59.279 --> 30:03.689
It's not some wild animal that's dying...
in pain or something?

30:04.280 --> 30:06.039
That's you,

30:06.040 --> 30:09.040
believe me.

30:12.079 --> 30:15.079
(Photocopier churning)

30:19.960 --> 30:22.718
I told Jenny.

30:22.719 --> 30:25.719
She took it pretty well.

30:25.999 --> 30:28.999
Oh, and I bleached my tache. Look.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.279
(Gasps)

30:37.280 --> 30:38.958
(Shuffling paper)

30:38.959 --> 30:40.558
Are you OK?

30:40.559 --> 30:42.279
- You're...
- (Panting)

30:42.280 --> 30:43.520
..clammy.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.719
I think I, er...

30:45.720 --> 30:48.720
rode my bike a bit fast.

30:49.359 --> 30:52.359
- Three hours ago.
- I'm out of condition.

30:53.920 --> 30:58.680
That doesn't explain your behaviour,
which is strange, even for you.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.078
- I'm excited.
- Sorry?

31:01.079 --> 31:02.759
I'm excited... by the...

31:04.840 --> 31:07.840
progress I'm making with my year 11s.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.278
Very strange.

31:10.279 --> 31:13.279
(Bell)

31:13.920 --> 31:15.920
(Katherine) "I am innocent to a witch.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.599
"I know not what a witch is."

31:17.599 --> 31:20.520
(Curtis) "How do you know then
that you're not a witch?"

31:20.520 --> 31:23.799
Is she a witch or not?
Hands up all those who think she is.

31:23.799 --> 31:26.799
- There's no evidence yet.
- Exactly!

31:27.320 --> 31:30.279
So let's focus on
the atmosphere in Salem

31:30.280 --> 31:31.999
at the start of act three.

31:31.999 --> 31:34.999
There's a witch hunt

31:35.880 --> 31:38.038
in progress.

31:38.039 --> 31:41.539
What's the big question...
everyone has to answer?

31:43.640 --> 31:46.078
The big... question.

31:46.079 --> 31:49.120
Do you now or have you
ever fancied Susan Gately?

31:49.120 --> 31:50.718
(Panting)

31:50.719 --> 31:53.159
It's a simple question, Mr Casey.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.798
Yes or no, please?

31:54.799 --> 31:56.199
Yes or no?

31:56.199 --> 31:59.199
Yes!

32:02.600 --> 32:05.600
(Jenny's groaning)

32:08.000 --> 32:10.478
(Groaning intensifies)

32:10.479 --> 32:13.198
(Orgasmic roaring)

32:13.199 --> 32:14.679
(Tape clicks off)

32:14.679 --> 32:17.079
Did you?

32:17.080 --> 32:18.838
- Never.
- Me neither.

32:18.839 --> 32:21.839
- Can I keep that?
- No.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.919
Hmmm-aah!

32:31.920 --> 32:34.799
Nothing like it.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.999
What are you doing tonight?

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
Pub, I guess, unless I can think of...

32:41.120 --> 32:43.159
No. Pub.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.198
How about a meal somewhere?

32:45.199 --> 32:47.879
Just the... two of us.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.999
You've not rethinking the flat?

32:49.999 --> 32:52.999
No, God, no.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.238
Well, then, what?

32:56.239 --> 32:59.118
I j...

32:59.119 --> 33:01.079
I just...

33:01.080 --> 33:03.438
I just wanna ask you something.

33:03.439 --> 33:04.999
What are you up to?

33:05.000 --> 33:08.160
- Nothing.
- I can always tell when you're lying.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.559
Please, just come out with me. I'll pay.

33:10.559 --> 33:13.559
For yourself?

33:14.199 --> 33:17.199
Both of us.

33:18.040 --> 33:21.039
Whatever you want from me
you're not going to get it.

33:21.039 --> 33:24.049
But... as long as we're clear about that...

33:26.080 --> 33:29.080
fine.

33:30.880 --> 33:33.880
(Orgasmic groaning)

33:35.480 --> 33:37.399
Rubbish.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.158
It's...

33:39.159 --> 33:40.659
Hmm-aaa-aah!

33:41.640 --> 33:44.640
What's wrong with you?

33:47.039 --> 33:49.078
Did you have the fish cakes?

33:49.079 --> 33:50.479
No.

33:50.479 --> 33:53.479
Well, he did.

33:53.839 --> 33:56.839
(Guttural groaning)

33:59.080 --> 34:01.159
Who's better, me or Brian?

34:01.160 --> 34:04.160
(Gentle moaning) Mmm-aaah!

34:07.199 --> 34:10.199
Mm-mmm aah-aah!

34:10.958 --> 34:13.879
- What's that supposed to be?
- Jenny.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.880
- It sounds nothing like it.
- You try.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.960
No, no, I've got too much to think about.

34:20.879 --> 34:23.159
I really fancy Susan.

34:23.159 --> 34:24.878
Since when?

34:24.879 --> 34:28.239
This morning.
I was standing really close to her

34:28.600 --> 34:31.518
and suddenly I felt...

34:31.520 --> 34:33.279
Her arse?

34:33.280 --> 34:35.998
Excited.

34:35.998 --> 34:39.399
She's lovely.
I can't believe I never saw it before.

34:39.399 --> 34:42.399
She'd just be my perfect girlfriend.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.598
- No.
- What?

34:44.599 --> 34:47.599
No, he wasn't talking about you.

34:53.799 --> 34:56.079
It's chatting up practice, isn't it?

34:56.079 --> 34:58.118
- What?
- This evening.

34:58.119 --> 35:01.880
You've learnt some new lines
and you want to try them on me.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.880
- Maybe.
- Good. I can hardly wait.

35:07.319 --> 35:10.319
I think you're gorgeous.

35:12.479 --> 35:15.479
Way too slimy.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.199
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.719
Don't tell me you've been to see him?

35:22.719 --> 35:24.759
Oh, I just asked...

35:24.760 --> 35:27.400
There was this problem.
He said he'd listen.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.480
- I can listen.
- Alec talks a lot of sense.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.839
And I don't?

35:32.840 --> 35:34.960
He's a professional psychologist.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.799
- I teach psychology.
- I teach gym,

35:37.800 --> 35:40.800
doesn't make me a gymnast.

35:41.080 --> 35:44.399
Thanks a lot.
With friends like you who needs...

35:44.399 --> 35:47.399
friends like you.

35:54.959 --> 35:57.959
(Banging on door)

35:59.279 --> 36:02.279
(Simon) Susan.

36:12.159 --> 36:15.159
Sorry.

36:20.119 --> 36:23.679
I talked to Alec cos it was something
I couldn't say to you.

36:23.679 --> 36:26.679
Oh, yeah?

36:26.960 --> 36:28.678
What?

36:28.679 --> 36:31.278
I just said, I can't talk to you.

36:31.279 --> 36:34.279
Fine. Keep it to yourself.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.320
I don't want to keep it to myself.

36:39.639 --> 36:42.639
- Sorry, Susan.
- Forget it.

36:43.239 --> 36:46.280
I didn't think you'd want to
hear me banging on about Kayla.

36:46.280 --> 36:49.119
- She doesn't.
- I know she's just a kid.

36:49.119 --> 36:50.920
I shouldn't let her get to me.

36:50.920 --> 36:53.919
I only talked to Alec
cos I thought you'd laugh at me.

36:53.919 --> 36:56.919
- But Alec didn't?
- No, he did.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.439
(♪ Jingly Mediterranean music)

37:02.439 --> 37:05.439
Can I have a... bottle of house red?

37:05.800 --> 37:08.800
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

37:12.960 --> 37:16.390
Could you imagine them doing it?
Simon and Susan.

37:17.759 --> 37:19.799
Yeah.

37:19.800 --> 37:24.070
Susan's on top. She's got a tub
of ice cream, chocolate chip.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.840
- She's tipping it...
- Stop it.

37:30.519 --> 37:34.229
It's like thinking of
your mum and dad having a shag.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.598
Has she got blonde hair, your mum?

37:39.599 --> 37:41.198
Yeah. Why?

37:41.199 --> 37:43.998
I was... trying to picture her...

37:43.999 --> 37:46.999
Stop it.

37:50.399 --> 37:51.880
Oh. (Sniffs)

37:51.880 --> 37:54.880
Your... moustache looks good.

37:55.999 --> 37:58.999
- Does it?
- Hm.

38:00.199 --> 38:03.199
Thanks.

38:04.360 --> 38:07.360
(♪ Jingly Mediterranean music)

38:12.079 --> 38:14.439
We could've done this at the pub.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.440
With Brian and Kurt listening?

38:16.440 --> 38:19.999
- You've hardly said a thing.
- I'm building up to it.

38:19.999 --> 38:21.999
Creating the right atmosphere.

38:21.999 --> 38:24.999
The right atmosphere.
For what exactly?

38:31.639 --> 38:34.639
I can't believe I've never...

38:35.080 --> 38:37.878
I haven't really noticed how...

38:37.879 --> 38:40.879
pretty... beautiful you are.

38:45.279 --> 38:47.438
That's terrible.

38:47.439 --> 38:49.640
I think you really are really...

38:49.640 --> 38:52.640
very...

38:53.639 --> 38:55.198
special.

38:55.199 --> 38:58.199
- Pitiful.
- Please, Susan, let me finish.

39:03.800 --> 39:07.999
I know in the past, up to now,
we've always been mates but...

39:07.999 --> 39:09.998
I want that to change.

39:09.999 --> 39:12.999
I want us to be something more.

39:13.079 --> 39:15.198
Different.

39:15.199 --> 39:18.199
I really, really fancy you.

39:19.479 --> 39:22.639
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I was kissing you.

39:22.639 --> 39:24.000
Why?

39:24.000 --> 39:25.638
Because it makes sense.

39:25.639 --> 39:27.800
You and me, we're made for each other.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.438
Plus I fancy you.

39:29.439 --> 39:31.919
- That was for real?
- Yeah.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.878
Is that so bad?

39:33.879 --> 39:35.999
- Yes, it fucking well is!
- Why?

39:35.999 --> 39:40.279
We're friends. Friends do not
suddenly get off with each other.

39:40.279 --> 39:42.440
- It happens all the time.
- Not to us.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.120
- Give me a reason why not.
- I don't fancy you.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.439
- Don't you?
- No!

39:46.439 --> 39:48.439
- Why not?
- I just don't.

39:48.440 --> 39:51.440
But I'm... good-looking, aren't I?

39:52.599 --> 39:55.599
I suppose so, in a boyish, obvious way.

39:55.639 --> 39:57.600
"Obvious"? What does that mean?

39:57.600 --> 39:59.919
I am not having this conversation.

39:59.919 --> 40:03.279
We've got to sort this out,
right here, tonight.

40:03.399 --> 40:06.689
- You're not attracted...
- I do not fancy you!

40:06.799 --> 40:09.799
But you might - one day.

40:10.479 --> 40:14.239
I never thought I'd want
to shag you but I worked on it.

40:14.239 --> 40:17.719
Made a big effort to see you
in a new light and it worked.

40:17.719 --> 40:21.079
This morning,
when I was looking at your lips...

40:21.160 --> 40:23.280
Stop it! You're scaring me now.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.678
Why?

40:25.679 --> 40:28.679
Because... you're not Simon.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.760
Yes, I am.

40:33.439 --> 40:36.439
Oh, shit.

40:39.240 --> 40:42.240
This isn't going the way I'd expected.

40:42.360 --> 40:44.999
If I'd eased in
or given you more warning...

40:44.999 --> 40:49.549
I'm not sure any amount of warning
could've prepared me for this.

40:52.559 --> 40:55.479
Have I really fucked things up?

40:55.480 --> 40:57.278
It could be better.

40:57.279 --> 41:00.279
Oh, I wish this evening hadn't happened.

41:02.599 --> 41:05.558
Well, let's just decide it didn't.

41:05.559 --> 41:08.559
Let's... try and forget the whole thing.

41:16.959 --> 41:20.039
We can still live with each other,
can't we?

41:22.719 --> 41:25.719
- Are you trying to be funny?
- (Gulps)

41:41.120 --> 41:44.120
(Bottles chinking)

41:48.959 --> 41:50.798
Oh, hi. That was quick.

41:50.799 --> 41:53.799
I wasn't hungry.

41:54.920 --> 41:57.000
Alec, could you do me a favour?

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
- If it's about the noise...
- No, no.

42:00.199 --> 42:03.199
Erm, it's about me moving out.

42:04.559 --> 42:08.599
Could you tell Jenny
I'd like to stay if that's OK with her?

42:08.599 --> 42:12.519
And if you stop walking around
in the nude all the time.

42:13.919 --> 42:16.239
Oh, and Alec...

42:16.240 --> 42:20.510
Brian and Kurt have always come to me
for advice in the past.

42:20.719 --> 42:25.199
I like to think I've helped them fuck up
most of their sad little lives.

42:25.199 --> 42:28.319
If you want them back,
you're more than welcome.

42:28.319 --> 42:31.319
Thanks. But...

42:32.200 --> 42:34.238
you can talk to Simon,

42:34.239 --> 42:36.359
naked, if you like.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.678
Tell him to be a bit more normal.

42:38.679 --> 42:41.679
I like him when he's normal.

42:41.720 --> 42:44.720
OK?

43:03.800 --> 43:06.800
- What did he do?
- The usual.

43:07.439 --> 43:10.600
Tried to get off with me.
Told me he fancied me.

43:10.600 --> 43:13.600
All that... boring stuff.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.519
And you told him...?

43:15.520 --> 43:18.520
To leave me alone.

43:21.399 --> 43:24.280
Have you really never thought
you'd be good together?

43:24.280 --> 43:27.500
I can't believe you
of all people saying that.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.799
Don't just turn him down

43:29.800 --> 43:32.950
because you think
I might laugh in your face.

43:34.159 --> 43:36.279
Actually, on second thoughts,

43:36.280 --> 43:39.500
maybe I would be better off
living with Simon.

43:52.839 --> 43:56.719
Susan doesn't want to share
a flat with me so I'm staying.

43:56.719 --> 43:59.160
- You can't. JP's moving in.
- When?

43:59.160 --> 44:03.150
Tomorrow. For a month or so
till he finds somewhere else.

44:05.679 --> 44:08.679
(Sighs heavily)

44:13.199 --> 44:16.199
(Door buzzer)

44:22.999 --> 44:25.999
(Gentle knocking)

44:36.359 --> 44:38.759
- Did I wake you?
- Yeah.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.799
Can I come in?

44:40.800 --> 44:43.800
No.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.838
- I'm sorry.
- You should be.

44:47.839 --> 44:50.238
Well, I am.

44:50.239 --> 44:52.679
(Sighs)

44:52.680 --> 44:55.640
Forget what I said.
Just come and live with me.

44:55.640 --> 44:58.639
- You're hopeless.
- That's why you love me.

44:58.639 --> 45:01.639
- Go away.
- Secretly you do, don't you?

45:01.679 --> 45:05.529
Yes, I secretly love
every psychotic man I've ever met.

45:05.840 --> 45:09.080
- Including me?
- I'm not going to live with you.

45:09.080 --> 45:13.070
(Sighs) If I promise never
to mention tonight ever again,

45:13.280 --> 45:16.479
ever, ever, ever again,
will you change your mind?

45:16.479 --> 45:18.280
- No.
- We'd have a laugh.

45:18.280 --> 45:21.679
No, we would've had a laugh
if you hadn't gone mental.

45:21.679 --> 45:24.440
There's no way
I could live with you now.

45:24.440 --> 45:27.359
I'd be checking
my bedroom door was locked

45:27.359 --> 45:30.800
and you'd be... drilling holes
in the bathroom wall.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.519
I wouldn't.

45:32.520 --> 45:35.520
Well, just the one... maybe.

45:36.120 --> 45:39.120
(Sighs)

45:39.839 --> 45:42.839
Are we friends again?

45:43.559 --> 45:47.400
If you stay at least five feet
away from me at all times,

45:47.400 --> 45:50.239
get me a coffee
first thing every morning

45:50.239 --> 45:53.239
and two pints every night, perhaps.

45:57.639 --> 46:01.279
- And no chance of a shag then?
- Good night, Simon.
