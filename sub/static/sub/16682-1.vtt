00:12.145 --> 00:14.175
I don't even.
I mean, why?

00:14.181 --> 00:15.611
He just talks to
her, he doesn't talk to her.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.776
He talks to her,
he doesn't talk to her.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.315
Yeah, that's exactly right,
it's like 4:00 in the morning,

00:19.320 --> 00:21.220
and I'm like, "Oh, my
God, Tim, Tim, Tim?"

00:21.222 --> 00:22.856
Okay, so not worth it.

00:26.293 --> 00:28.862
- Did you catch a word of that?
- Nope.

00:28.863 --> 00:31.163
It's a known fact
that the adult male brain

00:31.165 --> 00:33.995
is incapable of understanding
female speed talking.

00:34.001 --> 00:37.170
Last time I tried,
my head hurt for three days.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.612
Barkeep?

00:45.613 --> 00:47.582
Can't we put a game on
or something?

00:47.583 --> 00:49.681
Anything but
this sentimental crap?

00:49.683 --> 00:51.723
The movie stays on!

00:52.452 --> 00:53.792
Whatever.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.617
Women are demented.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.656
They babble incoherently, they
cry at the drop of a hat.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.632
To me, those are two
major symptoms of crazy.

01:03.633 --> 01:06.031
And there's Sam Wellman,
expert opinion on women.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.333
Damn straight.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.504
There ain't a female
on this planet

01:08.505 --> 01:10.440
that I can't figure out
in a minute flat.

01:10.441 --> 01:11.698
Especially Georgette.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.905
Diagnosis, nymphomania.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.676
Oh, would you get over yourself?

01:16.677 --> 01:19.446
It's about time that you found
yourself a nice woman

01:19.447 --> 01:21.607
and you settle down, huh?

01:21.615 --> 01:23.075
Like you and Cynthia?

01:23.084 --> 01:25.053
Don't go there.
Classic ball buster.

01:25.054 --> 01:26.822
I'm a happy man.
Shut the hell up.

01:26.823 --> 01:30.056
Is there a model
in Milan, New York,

01:30.057 --> 01:32.017
Paris, you haven't banged yet?

01:32.026 --> 01:34.756
I got a hot one tonight, Doc.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.097
This new girl at the agency.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.658
Oof.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.732
Oh, no.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.234
Don't tell me you caught
something again?

01:42.236 --> 01:43.796
Nah, it's just my dick
in my jockstrap.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.039
Great, can't help you with that.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.641
What would I do without you
when I got the clap?

01:49.643 --> 01:52.782
You would go to a urologist
instead of a G-Y-N.

01:52.783 --> 01:55.010
You're the only doctor
I can trust with my privacy.

01:55.015 --> 01:58.445
And I kind of like being the only guy
in New York with a gynecologist.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.252
You're a regular riot, Alice.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.390
Hey, honey.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.592
Speak of the devil.

02:06.594 --> 02:10.163
Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.864
Just having a drink with Sam.

02:11.866 --> 02:13.966
You know,
I could've guessed that.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.898
How's our favorite little
whoremonger doing?

02:15.903 --> 02:18.438
Ow! What are you doing?

02:18.439 --> 02:19.639
She's not gonna
come over here, is she?

02:19.640 --> 02:22.570
So, where are you taking me
to dinner tonight?

02:22.576 --> 02:24.876
Somewhere expensive.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.579
Oh, right answer.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.520
Oh, my God,
tell Sam I heard that.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.676
<i>He's beyond repugnant.</i>

02:34.121 --> 02:36.691
See you later, Soo-Soo.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.560
What?

02:45.566 --> 02:49.026
You know what...
Poo-Poo.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.696
You're going to the
bachelor party, right?

02:50.704 --> 02:51.844
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

02:51.845 --> 02:53.169
You gonna behave yourself?

02:53.174 --> 02:54.644
I was thinking about
sending Stephen

02:54.645 --> 02:57.142
some videos of me
and the blushing bride.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.914
I might just post them
on the Internet.

02:58.915 --> 03:00.913
I hope you're kidding.

03:09.756 --> 03:10.956
Good morning, Sam.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.458
Morning, morning.

03:12.459 --> 03:15.189
Listen, I retyped your proposal,
added a couple things.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.696
Hope you like it.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.537
We're gonna do that dinner,
Margaret, I swear.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.038
That'd be great, Sam.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.107
Good morning,
Mr. Wellman.

03:28.108 --> 03:31.038
Mr. Cavalo would like to see you
in his office when you're ready.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.605
Hello, Melissa.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.183
How was your weekend?
Fine, thank you.

03:35.184 --> 03:36.622
Should I ask how yours was?

03:36.623 --> 03:39.147
Oh, you know, usual debauchery.

03:39.153 --> 03:42.222
Grist for my novel.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.492
And, uh, what would that
novel be about again?

03:44.493 --> 03:46.231
It's about an office assistant.

03:46.232 --> 03:48.757
Demure, passionate, very lonely.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.262
Madly in love with her
incredibly attractive boss.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.765
Wow, you have quite
the imagination.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.336
You wouldn't wanna help me
do the research, would you?

03:56.337 --> 03:58.067
You know, I'm writing
my own novel.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.542
Would you like to hear about it?

03:59.543 --> 04:00.840
No.

04:09.849 --> 04:13.549
Do you know the first thing
I notice about a woman?

04:13.554 --> 04:15.922
Her ass.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.723
I mean, have you ever
noticed how a woman's ass

04:17.725 --> 04:20.285
gets a little firmer
when she's nervous?

04:21.528 --> 04:23.498
It's a thing of beauty.

04:24.797 --> 04:26.897
I should be writing
this down, shouldn't I?

04:26.900 --> 04:29.430
Let's take a closer look.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.107
Oh...

04:34.108 --> 04:36.068
Oh, listen,

04:36.076 --> 04:39.506
Lulu loved our suggestion
on the new brassiere line.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.648
Outstanding.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.519
How's it going with her
by the way?

04:43.520 --> 04:44.847
How's it going?

04:44.852 --> 04:46.590
She tied me
to the bed last night

04:46.591 --> 04:48.787
and beat the crap out of me,
that's how it's going.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.289
That good, huh?
And by the way...

04:51.859 --> 04:55.228
Lulu said she was stopping by
on the way to a fashion show

04:55.229 --> 04:57.329
to tell you in person.
She should be here...

04:57.331 --> 04:59.501
Excuse me, uh,
Mr. Cavalo, Lulu's here.

04:59.502 --> 05:01.370
She's waiting for you
in the conference room.

05:01.371 --> 05:03.236
Just about now.

05:03.237 --> 05:05.367
Thank you. Tell her
we'll be right there.

05:05.372 --> 05:07.042
Yes, Mr. Cavalo.

05:10.643 --> 05:14.247
So, last night, Stephanie?

05:15.516 --> 05:18.916
Oh, hey, wait, taxi's on me.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.589
I should've listened
to Christina.

05:20.590 --> 05:22.647
She said you were a pig.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.759
It's a work in progress.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.860
A work in progress?

05:28.862 --> 05:32.131
Sam, don't over think it,
it's Pavlovian.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.466
Huh?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.767
It's Pavlovian.

05:39.205 --> 05:41.365
Pavlov's dogs?

05:41.375 --> 05:43.335
You push the right buttons,
they salivate.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.614
I mean, for some women,
it's money.

05:44.615 --> 05:46.711
Other women, it's marriage.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.484
But whatever it is, you
give 'em the right spiel,

05:49.485 --> 05:51.351
they roll over.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.720
Got you, Sey.
Lulu.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.321
We gotta stop meeting like this.

05:55.322 --> 05:58.057
Aw, poor Seymour.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.258
Oh, I imagine you're still
smarting from last night.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.391
Mmm-hmm.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.226
We did get a bit adventurous.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.598
A bit.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.429
Especially with that spatula.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.734
Shh...

06:08.736 --> 06:10.396
Ooh, God, that thing
leaves marks.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.474
Tell me about it.

06:12.475 --> 06:15.007
Hmm. Oh, Sam.
Hey!

06:15.008 --> 06:17.608
Oh, you make
an adorable executive.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.911
So cute in that suit.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.913
God, I could just eat him
up with peanut butter.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.446
Hell, forget the peanut butter,
just give him to me plain.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.552
It's nice to see you, Lulu.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.561
I hope you liked the models we
sent you for the lingerie show.

06:30.562 --> 06:33.787
They were skinny, stupid, and
drugged out of their minds.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.364
Uh...
Uh...

06:36.362 --> 06:38.862
In other words,
they were perfect.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.526
The buyers loved them.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.934
I want them for
the next two shows.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.066
So, you'll make sure
Mr. Naughty

06:46.073 --> 06:47.907
stays out of trouble.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.976
Ahh!

06:49.977 --> 06:52.537
Until our rendezvous
later at the hotel?

06:52.546 --> 06:55.376
It's a date.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.782
Okay.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.046
Bye-bye, cutie pie.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.419
That's it? Quick
and almost painless?

07:05.426 --> 07:06.686
What?

07:07.293 --> 07:08.528
Mr. Naughty?

07:08.529 --> 07:09.929
I'm telling you something, Sam.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.599
You remind me so much
of me when I was younger.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.067
A genius?

07:15.068 --> 07:17.837
No, a complete asshole.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.538
But a brilliant one.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.040
To tell you the truth,

07:21.041 --> 07:23.711
I wasn't half as slick as you
are when I was your age.

07:23.712 --> 07:25.910
Guess I am a bit of a prodigy.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.614
Move over, Mozart.
Wait a minute, Sam.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.416
I gotta ask you.
Stephanie?

07:32.419 --> 07:33.789
Does she...

07:34.654 --> 07:37.123
Does she wear panties?

07:37.124 --> 07:39.424
Congratulations
on the Lulu account, Sam.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.286
We just got the memo
about our next show.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.785
Couldn't have done it
without you, Margaret, baby.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.526
I just told Seymour that, too.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.101
What, what, I don't know...
Right, right, Seymour?

07:46.102 --> 07:49.938
Yes, Margaret, of course, it
was a great job, lovely, yes.

07:49.939 --> 07:52.037
Can you do us a favor?
Can you, uh...

07:52.039 --> 07:53.339
Can you excuse us?
Of course.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.310
We're talking very
important business here.

07:56.542 --> 07:57.812
So...

07:58.444 --> 08:00.146
You were saying?

08:02.114 --> 08:03.649
No.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.988
I wish that wasn't
as true as it sounds.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.034
Hey, I wanna propose
a toast real quick.

08:16.035 --> 08:17.459
Okay.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.098
To my buddy, Stephen.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.799
You know what they say, Stephen.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.731
What do they say?

08:22.736 --> 08:24.866
Marriage is the only war where
you sleep with the enemy.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.572
Hey!

08:31.010 --> 08:33.645
Joey, keep 'em coming!
Another round.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.006
You got it, buddy.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.674
Here's to Stephen.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.923
Congratu-fricku-lations, you
horny little son-of-a-bitch.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.350
Okay.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.716
That's all right.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.961
Okay.
Hey, maybe...

08:44.962 --> 08:46.888
I'll get it.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.832
Hey, whoa, whoa,
turn the tunes down.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.499
Oh, no.
Are we being loud here?

08:51.500 --> 08:53.298
We're probably in trouble.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.500
It's show time!

08:56.503 --> 08:58.703
Whoo! It's show time.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.065
Whoo-hoo.

09:00.073 --> 09:03.242
Look at this.
Wow!

09:03.243 --> 09:04.977
Yo. Come on,
get your ass out here.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.378
Wow! Come on.
Let's see those asses.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.176
Come on, let's see those asses.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.485
Pull up a chair for this guy.

09:13.487 --> 09:16.587
Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.863
What, you had to bring
your own tequila?

09:24.865 --> 09:26.525
We didn't have enough
bottles here for you?

09:26.533 --> 09:29.268
It's not tequila, it's Anejo.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.169
An-e-Jo.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.941
I stand corrected.
You stand corrected.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.272
Hey, Stevie, you gonna wear

09:36.276 --> 09:37.876
your wedding ring
when you get married?

09:42.416 --> 09:43.776
What the hell
are you doing, man?

09:43.784 --> 09:45.753
I'm documenting for posterity.

09:45.754 --> 09:47.922
You're gonna send those
to Georgette.

09:47.923 --> 09:50.089
That's a great idea.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.690
That's very wrong, Sam.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.062
Yeah, well, who are
you, my priest?

09:53.063 --> 09:54.590
No, I'm your best friend.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.025
Yeah, well,
you know what, friend?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.729
What, friend?

09:59.365 --> 10:00.895
Mind your own freaking business.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.801
Okay, I have to be a good boy.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.074
You girls go see Joey.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.238
What's your name, baby?

10:10.243 --> 10:11.477
My name's Cat.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.078
How about you?
Legs.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.210
Oh, man, I'm right where
I'm supposed to be.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.516
Whew.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.422
Where the hell are you going?

10:24.424 --> 10:25.858
Out.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.159
You got a problem with that?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.830
Yeah, I got a problem with that.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.662
Tough.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.915
Excuse me.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.231
Hmm.

11:28.921 --> 11:30.961
That's a good-looking hat.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.060
Can I help you, young man?

11:42.134 --> 11:44.244
Oh, nice hat.

11:44.737 --> 11:45.867
Thank you.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.172
Didn't offer much protection

11:47.174 --> 11:50.009
from the cold at Valley Forge,

11:50.010 --> 11:53.310
but it looked good at the victory
parade a few years later.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.980
Tea?

11:54.981 --> 11:56.549
Got anything stronger?

11:56.550 --> 11:59.150
Oh, it's strong tea.
It's a special blend.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.319
Sit down.

12:13.466 --> 12:14.666
Good?

12:15.334 --> 12:16.634
Yeah.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.505
Big night on the town, eh?

12:21.508 --> 12:23.408
Bachelor party.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.611
Not mine.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.612
Confirmed bachelor, eh?

12:28.914 --> 12:30.983
Hmm.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.924
Are the happy couple
good friends?

12:32.925 --> 12:34.049
Huh?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.454
Relationships work best

12:35.455 --> 12:37.755
when there's a strong bond
of friendship.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.688
Trust, a core of trust?

12:40.694 --> 12:44.201
He's crazy if he trusts her,
I can tell you that much.

12:44.202 --> 12:45.797
A good-looking
young man like you

12:45.799 --> 12:47.629
must have a girlfriend.

12:47.634 --> 12:48.774
Whenever I want.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.400
No one special?

12:53.072 --> 12:55.841
No such thing.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.812
You're not very fond
of the female

12:57.813 --> 12:59.480
of the species, are you?

12:59.481 --> 13:03.149
Good for one thing
and one thing only.

13:03.150 --> 13:06.719
Women are God's gift
to the world, son.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.150
I guess He forgot
to give me my present.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.386
How do you know God's a he?

13:12.392 --> 13:13.562
Please.

13:15.194 --> 13:18.133
Well, thanks for the tea,
old-timer. I gotta get going.

13:18.134 --> 13:19.661
Where do you live, son?

13:19.666 --> 13:21.226
Murray Hill.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.003
Murray Hill.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.974
That's a very nice neighborhood.

13:25.975 --> 13:27.339
Thanks.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.240
Do you know how Murray
Hill got its name?

13:29.242 --> 13:31.242
Murray's Deli?

13:31.244 --> 13:32.978
No.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.747
The Murray family.

13:34.748 --> 13:36.748
Quakers.
They were Quakers,

13:36.750 --> 13:40.219
you know, like the oatmeal?
Right.

13:40.220 --> 13:44.156
They had a fine mansion up
at the top of Murray Hill.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.027
It was about where
37th and Park is today.

13:48.928 --> 13:52.128
Mrs. Murray was
a very good-looking woman.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.532
Good for Mr. Murray.

13:54.534 --> 13:59.071
Yeah, well, Mr. Murray wasn't
around on September 15, 1776

13:59.072 --> 14:03.982
when 20,000 British and Hessian
troops invaded Manhattan.

14:05.077 --> 14:07.277
They landed at Kips Bay.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.916
That's about where
34th Street is today.

14:10.917 --> 14:13.177
Washington had about
9,000 troops,

14:13.186 --> 14:15.986
but they were most of them
stationed downtown.

14:15.989 --> 14:19.619
The British were about ready
to cut the rebels in two.

14:19.626 --> 14:23.086
But Mrs. Murray
outsmarted them.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.996
She plied the soldiers with wine

14:24.998 --> 14:26.828
and flirted with the general.

14:26.833 --> 14:30.202
Just like a broad.
Well,

14:30.203 --> 14:32.173
while she was entertaining
the top brass,

14:32.174 --> 14:34.742
the rebels escaped
up the west side.

14:35.908 --> 14:37.108
Yes, without her,

14:37.110 --> 14:40.579
the war would've been over
before it started.

14:40.580 --> 14:44.617
Washington, Jefferson,
John Adams.

14:44.618 --> 14:48.048
The whole bunch of 'em would've
been hanged for treason.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.524
Hmm.

14:50.189 --> 14:51.659
A woman?

14:52.224 --> 14:54.760
It's the truth.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.861
Mrs. Murray saved
the Americans.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.534
She saved the revolution.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.636
She saved the brand-new
U.S. of A.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.737
Well, that's a hell
of a story, Pops.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.707
I'll remember it next time
I'm walking down Park Avenue.

15:07.708 --> 15:09.367
Yeah, remember what
I told you about women.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.776
That's why I told you the story.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.847
Well, they must've broke
the mold when they made her,

15:14.848 --> 15:17.818
'cause ever chick nowadays
is a total bitch.

15:20.719 --> 15:23.119
Maybe you just need to
live a little bit more.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.363
There's nothing like
experience to open your eyes.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.233
Yeah, right.

15:30.863 --> 15:34.867
Uh, hey, uh, which way
is 7th Avenue?

15:34.868 --> 15:38.068
Guy who laid out these streets
must've been cross-eyed.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.940
You take the first right
out the door.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.441
Then you take
the next two rights.

15:45.210 --> 15:48.480
Well, thanks, Pops.
I'll see ya.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.722
Yes, you will.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.942
Cool dream.

16:44.103 --> 16:46.472
Oh, my God, oh, my God,

16:46.473 --> 16:48.040
oh, my God!

16:48.041 --> 16:51.311
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

17:00.452 --> 17:03.288
A hallucination.
A hallucination.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.459
A hallucination.

17:10.561 --> 17:11.932
Shit.

17:12.498 --> 17:13.728
Shit!

17:16.101 --> 17:18.401
Hi, can I help you?
Where's Doc?

17:18.405 --> 17:19.795
I'm sorry, who are you
here to see?

17:19.806 --> 17:21.036
Doc.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.108
Dr. Andrew Bellamy,
O-B-G-Y-N.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.578
It says it right there
on the door.

17:24.579 --> 17:26.577
Well, Dr. Bellamy's with
a patient right now.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.279
Okay, well,
I need to see him now.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.522
Okay, young lady,
please calm yourself down.

17:31.523 --> 17:33.348
Yes, please.

17:33.353 --> 17:36.388
Oh, mind your
own business, Miss STD!

17:36.389 --> 17:38.057
Okay, you know what?

17:38.058 --> 17:40.288
I will set up an appointment
for you with Dr. Bellamy...

17:40.293 --> 17:41.627
Hey!

17:41.628 --> 17:44.058
Don't mess with me, bitch!

17:50.569 --> 17:52.099
Doc!

17:52.105 --> 17:53.905
Look what fuckin'
happened to me, dude!

17:53.907 --> 17:55.437
Look at me!

17:55.442 --> 17:57.912
Miss, please, I am in the
middle of an examination here.

17:57.913 --> 18:01.880
Would you tell trash mouth
Sally here to wait her turn?

18:01.881 --> 18:03.551
Oh, shut the hell up, lady!

18:03.552 --> 18:04.880
Doc, you got...

18:04.884 --> 18:07.054
Miss, if you do not behave,
I will call security.

18:07.055 --> 18:09.053
Angie, that won't be necessary.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.415
Help me with
Mrs. Goldfarb here.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.923
We're gonna move you
to another room.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.555
Thank you, Doctor and Angie.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.990
What a <i>yakhneh!</i>

18:16.595 --> 18:18.325
Angie, I won't be long.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.269
Doc, I don't know
what happened, man.

18:22.270 --> 18:24.698
I woke up this morning,
and I'm a fuckin' broad!

18:24.704 --> 18:26.504
Okay, there are a lot of

18:26.506 --> 18:28.436
psychologist's offices
in the building.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.371
Are you sure you didn't
walk into the wrong one?

18:30.376 --> 18:31.906
Doc, you gotta believe me.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.981
I feel like I'm in
this, like, this nightmare.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.710
Like, I just keep
waiting to wake up!

18:36.716 --> 18:39.946
Dude, it's me!
It's Sam!

18:39.953 --> 18:41.320
Sam?

18:41.321 --> 18:44.590
Sam! Sam Wellman,
your best friend?

18:44.591 --> 18:46.658
Okay, very good.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.289
How much is he paying you?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.164
Ask me something.
Ask me anything.

18:50.165 --> 18:51.763
Really, I get the joke.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.402
Yeah, okay, ask me something
about... About Cynthia.

18:54.403 --> 18:55.630
You know about Cynthia?

18:55.635 --> 18:56.925
Dude, I know
everything about you.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.266
You're Boo-Boo,
she's Soo-Soo.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.039
He told you that?

19:01.040 --> 19:03.470
Oh! You were nine years old.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.106
You showed it
to Lauren Abramsky.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.411
She kicked you in the nuts.

19:06.412 --> 19:07.882
You told your mom
you fell off the swing.

19:07.883 --> 19:10.111
He told you that?
I was there, dude.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.576
I practically carried you home.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.718
Oh!

19:12.719 --> 19:14.889
Senior Prom,
Sandi O'Malley gave you

19:14.890 --> 19:16.718
your second blow job
under the bleachers.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.093
Your first blow job,
March 1st, 1993,

19:19.094 --> 19:21.092
Lisa Kaminsky in your basement,

19:21.094 --> 19:22.294
your mom came home...

19:22.295 --> 19:23.825
Is there anything that prick
didn't tell you?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.230
I am that prick!

19:26.098 --> 19:27.368
Oh!

19:28.667 --> 19:31.236
DNA!

19:31.237 --> 19:33.537
Miss, please,
put down the scissors.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.207
Doc, DNA.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.838
DNA.
Get a DNA test done.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.281
Great, please, the scissors,
before someone gets hurt.

19:39.282 --> 19:41.809
Yeah, but Doc, you have the
blood from the paternity suit.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.183
We get a DNA test done,
poof, yeah.

19:44.184 --> 19:47.419
Okay, sure, great.
Now, give me the scissors.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.350
And go home
and get some rest, huh?

19:49.355 --> 19:50.885
Okay, but you're gonna do it.
You'll do it right away.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.157
Yeah, as soon as you leave,

19:52.158 --> 19:53.818
it goes right to
the DNA office or whatever.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.326
Yeah? Okay.
Yeah, sure, great.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.458
Okay, good,
but you're gonna do it?

19:56.462 --> 19:57.596
Uh-huh.
Okay.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.257
Just relax.
Okay.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.455
Go home.
Okay.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.266
Get some rest.
All right.

20:06.438 --> 20:08.908
Fucking Sam, Jesus.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.640
Have an amazing day,
Mr. Johnson.

20:15.147 --> 20:16.347
Excuse me.
Hey, Lou, what's up?

20:16.349 --> 20:17.718
Excuse me, can I help you?

20:17.719 --> 20:19.477
I can't right now, Lou,
I got a situation.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.845
Excuse me, Miss?

20:20.853 --> 20:22.287
Uh...

20:22.288 --> 20:24.756
You're here to see who?

20:24.757 --> 20:27.226
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.787
I am Sam Wellman's cousin.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.956
I, uh...
He gave me the keys.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.900
Yeah, Sam, he's a great guy.
Uh-huh.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.302
Yeah, he's letting me stay here

20:37.303 --> 20:38.603
just for, uh, for a little bit.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.365
That's great, Miss...

20:40.373 --> 20:43.308
Samantha Wellman.
Samantha Wellman.

20:43.309 --> 20:46.039
Lou, but you knew that already.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.445
Yeah, Sam, uh, speaks
very highly of you.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.048
Is that right?
Yeah.

20:51.283 --> 20:52.783
Let me know if there's
anything I can do for you?

20:52.785 --> 20:54.485
All right, cool, cool.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.287
Thanks, Lou.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.119
Boom, yeah.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.324
Cool!

21:10.736 --> 21:11.896
Doc!

21:11.904 --> 21:13.604
Ah, I knew that you'd call.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.966
Dude, yo, yo, yo, you get
those test results back yet?

21:15.975 --> 21:18.275
Look, I don't know who you are

21:18.278 --> 21:20.278
or what you think
you're doing, lady,

21:20.280 --> 21:22.480
but this stopped being funny
a long time ago.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.082
<i>Now where the hell is Sa?</i>

21:24.083 --> 21:25.450
Doc, come on, dude!

21:25.451 --> 21:27.851
<i>It's me, it's Sam!
You gotta...</i>

21:27.854 --> 21:29.524
Ugh! Ugh!

21:30.222 --> 21:31.722
Hey, baby.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.858
Hey, hey, hey.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.859
How's it going?
Good.

21:34.861 --> 21:35.961
Mmm...

21:41.701 --> 21:44.601
Melissa, hey, yeah.

21:45.570 --> 21:47.670
Really? No messages.

21:47.674 --> 21:51.276
Yeah, I called him, but
some lady keeps answering.

21:51.277 --> 21:53.177
I don't know who she is.
Call girl.

21:53.179 --> 21:56.379
I'm sure he is just
sleeping it off

21:56.382 --> 21:58.752
in a motel somewhere, you know?

21:59.785 --> 22:01.915
Okay.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.521
Yeah, let me know as soon as

22:03.523 --> 22:06.491
you hear anything, please, okay?

22:06.492 --> 22:07.859
Bye.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.998
Honey, Sam's a big boy.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.829
He can take care of himself.

22:19.205 --> 22:21.365
You gotta be kidding me.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.308
All right, lady, you win!

22:23.309 --> 22:24.839
Now where the hell is Sam?

22:24.844 --> 22:27.784
Oh, my God, I am so sick of Sam.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.417
Okay, okay.

22:32.418 --> 22:33.878
Either Boo-Boo
apologizes

22:33.886 --> 22:36.616
and gets very snuggly,
very quickly,

22:36.622 --> 22:39.422
or Soo-Soo is gonna
squeeze Boo-Boo's balls.

22:39.425 --> 22:41.255
And I guarantee,
you're not gonna like it.

22:47.499 --> 22:50.129
Boo-Boo,
what's the matter?

22:50.136 --> 22:51.866
I'm sorry.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.341
Did Boo-Boo take
all his vitamins today?

22:54.342 --> 22:56.110
Yeah, yeah.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.311
I just left something at work.

23:01.314 --> 23:03.248
I have to go to work, yeah.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.519
Ugh.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.885
At 11:30 at night?

23:14.226 --> 23:16.986
Okay, God, I must be crazy.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.777
Oh, fuck.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.824
Okay, but you'll process
that right away.

23:39.825 --> 23:40.986
Rush job.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.387
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

23:42.388 --> 23:44.388
<i>Maybe tomorrow.
No promises.</i>

23:46.058 --> 23:48.488
Excuse me, Doctor,
your 1:00 p.m. is here.

23:48.494 --> 23:50.394
Okay, I'll be out in a minute.

23:52.031 --> 23:55.300
Just let me know as soon
as you hear something, okay?

23:55.301 --> 23:57.601
Melissa, come on,
where the hell is he?

23:57.603 --> 24:00.141
We have a very important
lunch meeting today.

24:00.142 --> 24:02.369
I've tried him on both lines, Mr.
Cavalo.

24:02.375 --> 24:03.705
Yes, and?

24:03.709 --> 24:05.078
And he hasn't answered,

24:05.079 --> 24:07.237
and he isn't answering
his e-mails either.

24:07.246 --> 24:08.846
I don't care what kind
of a bender he's on,

24:08.848 --> 24:10.378
it's just not like him.

24:10.383 --> 24:12.283
Well, he had a bachelor party
that he had to go to.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.885
I know, who do you think
got him the strippers?

24:17.690 --> 24:20.090
Now you sleep with the fishes,

24:20.092 --> 24:22.992
Don Cheech.

24:27.032 --> 24:29.732
Boo-Boo?

24:29.735 --> 24:31.235
What?

24:33.905 --> 24:37.365
Why couldn't you have
been a chiropodist?

24:37.376 --> 24:38.936
What?

24:38.945 --> 24:41.105
You stare at it all day.

24:41.113 --> 24:44.113
And now you've lost
your sex drive!

25:00.199 --> 25:03.829
Okay, "I have been called
away by a family emergency."

25:03.836 --> 25:08.006
"My cousin, Samantha,
is here to save the day."

25:08.007 --> 25:10.037
"She's got just as much
experience as me"

25:10.042 --> 25:12.742
"and can cover my accounts
just as well as me"

25:12.745 --> 25:16.505
"until I get back from..."

25:18.116 --> 25:20.416
"From..." No.

25:21.052 --> 25:22.892
"Till I get back."

25:24.890 --> 25:26.120
Huh.

25:26.125 --> 25:29.355
Cousin Samantha, huh?

25:29.362 --> 25:32.197
Well, as long as she's hot.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.088
Could I get some help over here?

25:59.091 --> 26:00.859
Oh.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.460
Okay, all right.

26:30.221 --> 26:32.461
- Morning, morning.
- Good morning.

26:35.393 --> 26:37.696
Excuse me, can I help you?

26:37.697 --> 26:39.697
Margaret.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.229
Er, do I know you?

26:42.234 --> 26:44.336
Right, um, indirectly.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.767
I am Sam Wellman's cousin.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.072
Samantha.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.174
What a pleasure to meet you.

26:50.176 --> 26:53.036
Sam has just told me so...

26:53.045 --> 26:55.875
Well, actually, he never
mentioned you at all.

26:55.881 --> 26:57.150
That didn't come out right.

26:57.151 --> 26:59.279
Oh, no, no, no, no,
it's fine, um, see,

26:59.285 --> 27:03.045
Sam and I have a...
A very complex relationship.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.315
But look, I'm happy to help
out in his time of need.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.162
Okay, I hope everything is okay
with your family, I mean...

27:08.163 --> 27:11.299
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm sure
everything will be just fine.

27:11.300 --> 27:13.757
Mmm-hmm, I'm gonna
go see Mr. Cavalo.

27:13.766 --> 27:14.996
Sure, let me show you.

27:15.001 --> 27:18.301
No, it's fine, I know...
Sam.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.704
Right.

27:19.705 --> 27:22.005
Gonna do that dinner, though,
Margaret, I swear.

27:27.112 --> 27:30.212
Ah, Melissa, good.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.746
Samantha Wellman, Sam's
fine, everything's good.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.852
He will be back soon.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.154
Nice to meet you, Miss Wellman.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.545
Oh, please, Mel.

27:37.556 --> 27:40.016
Sam, Samantha, Sam, just
like the other guy, cool?

27:40.026 --> 27:41.786
Yeah, up, up, come.

27:41.794 --> 27:44.734
Uh, go grab me that Lulu
file like a good girl, huh?

27:44.735 --> 27:45.960
Sure.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.025
You look great
in that dress, oof.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.915
Sam never told me about you.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.388
And now I know why.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.989
Why?
Come on in.

28:12.757 --> 28:14.187
Can I offer you a drink?

28:14.193 --> 28:15.593
A Bloody Mary?

28:15.594 --> 28:16.861
Sit.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.962
So Samantha.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.029
So Seymour.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.565
Welcome to the family.

28:24.570 --> 28:25.870
Yeah, no.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.609
Um, why don't we talk
about the Lulu account?

28:28.610 --> 28:30.967
Sam has given me
a thorough briefing.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.806
Let's not talk
about business yet.

28:32.812 --> 28:35.980
We haven't even gotten
to know each other.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.181
Yeah, well, you know, Sam's gonna
be back before we know it,

28:38.184 --> 28:41.586
so... I hope.
Think! Think.

28:41.587 --> 28:44.147
We gotta get to know each
other, right? Family.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.656
One of the family.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.163
Do you know the first thing
I notice about a woman?

28:50.164 --> 28:52.502
Her ass?
Exa... No!

28:53.264 --> 28:54.966
Her eyes.

28:54.967 --> 28:58.167
Oh, yeah, okay. What?

28:58.170 --> 29:00.970
Our eyes are the windows
to our soul.

29:00.973 --> 29:05.310
And I can see that our windows
are connecting beautifully.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.178
Oh, oh, are they?

29:07.179 --> 29:11.349
You know, maybe you and I
should grab a bite.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.050
Dinner tonight.

29:13.052 --> 29:16.392
Oh, you know what? I can't.
I actually, I have plans.

29:16.393 --> 29:17.618
Cancel them.

29:17.623 --> 29:18.923
With my boyfriend.

29:18.924 --> 29:21.126
Invite him, bring him along.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.027
We can always send him
home early.

29:23.028 --> 29:26.328
Yeah, but, you know, it...
It's our anniversary.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.232
So three's a crowd
kind of a thing.

29:28.234 --> 29:29.934
Maybe tomorrow night.
Yeah, okay.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.165
So, yeah, no,
I actually, I gotta go.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.770
I'm gonna go, I have to work.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.913
Work, work, work,
you know, see you, Sey.

29:35.914 --> 29:37.608
I'm gonna work.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.110
Work, work, work!

29:43.815 --> 29:45.545
Samantha, hi.

29:46.151 --> 29:48.119
Margaret.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.820
Everything go well with Seymour?

29:49.822 --> 29:51.362
He can be a little brusque.

29:51.363 --> 29:52.887
Yeah.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.392
Fine, just fine.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.087
Here.

29:57.096 --> 29:58.896
Here, let me help.

30:00.765 --> 30:03.995
You know, you just let me
know if there's anything

30:04.003 --> 30:06.003
I can do for you
during your stay with us.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.835
Thanks, Margaret,
thanks a million.

30:08.841 --> 30:10.811
Sam would want that,
don't you think?

30:11.476 --> 30:13.106
Yeah.

30:13.112 --> 30:15.852
Listen, you knew my name
when you came in.

30:15.853 --> 30:18.516
Sam must've talked about me.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.517
Did he?
Uh, yeah, yeah, he did.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.120
He said, um...

30:24.123 --> 30:26.291
"Margaret..."

30:26.292 --> 30:29.292
"Great gal."

30:29.295 --> 30:31.955
Uh, you have a wonderful day.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.528
You too.

30:48.546 --> 30:50.976
Who are those for?
Sam?

30:52.016 --> 30:55.886
No, they're for you,
Soo-Soo.

30:55.888 --> 30:58.488
12 white roses for "I'm sorry,"

30:58.490 --> 31:01.560
and one red rose
for "I love you."

31:02.527 --> 31:03.787
13?

31:17.976 --> 31:19.876
Here's to you,
Soo-Soo.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.483
Mmm.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.419
No, no.

31:32.424 --> 31:33.724
Just...
Don't.

31:33.726 --> 31:34.956
Let me...
Don't.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.629
Check really quick.
See who it is.

31:37.630 --> 31:39.400
If that's Sam and you answer it,

31:39.401 --> 31:41.328
we are so over.

31:44.269 --> 31:46.239
Johnny, did you get the results?

31:46.240 --> 31:48.368
This is the goddamnedest thing.

31:48.374 --> 31:49.944
I've never seen such
a spot-on correlation

31:49.945 --> 31:51.582
between male and female DNA.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.943
What?
<i>Ever.</i>

31:54.712 --> 31:57.348
Ever.
<i>Never.</i>

31:57.349 --> 31:59.709
I've seen identical twins that
were nowhere near this close.

31:59.984 --> 32:02.154
But... How, um...

32:02.987 --> 32:05.187
Who do these belong to anyway?

32:05.190 --> 32:08.130
Thanks, Johnny.
I owe you one.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.900
So, uh, what was that all about?

32:12.901 --> 32:15.068
If I'm not being
too inquisitive.

32:15.069 --> 32:16.567
It's a long story.

32:26.010 --> 32:28.746
Good, so write me a letter.

32:28.747 --> 32:29.977
Okay.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.819
You son of a bitch.

32:34.820 --> 32:36.688
Okay.

32:46.664 --> 32:48.800
Okay, okay!

32:48.801 --> 32:50.801
Oh.

32:52.904 --> 32:54.973
Okay, all right, all right.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.644
Keep your pants on!

32:58.409 --> 32:59.809
Ugh.

33:03.681 --> 33:05.881
Doc, Doc, did you hear?

33:05.884 --> 33:07.986
Yeah, oh, yeah, I heard.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.487
So now you believe me.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.318
I don't know what to believe.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.393
Yeah, but it was a match, right?
That's what the man said.

33:13.394 --> 33:14.732
Yes!

33:15.626 --> 33:17.126
Uh...
Oh.

33:17.695 --> 33:19.255
All right.

33:19.264 --> 33:22.433
I don't necessarily believe you.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.772
Okay, you dumb bastard,
what more proof do you need?

33:24.773 --> 33:28.010
But I don't necessarily think
that you're lying either.

33:28.011 --> 33:31.876
I just...
Jesus.

33:31.877 --> 33:34.607
Yeah, well, I've been busy, pal.

33:35.446 --> 33:37.646
That's what Sam always said.

33:37.949 --> 33:39.417
Said?

33:39.418 --> 33:41.148
Dude, I'm not dead.
I'm standing right here.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.623
Oh, God, I need a drink, Jesus.

33:50.061 --> 33:52.901
Doc, you're my best friend.

33:54.232 --> 33:56.732
Actually, you're my only friend.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.295
Doc, you gotta believe me.

33:58.303 --> 33:59.703
Man, you gotta help me.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.835
I just... I don't know
where to turn.

34:03.641 --> 34:05.281
I wanna...

34:06.110 --> 34:09.647
I wanna help you, Sam.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.047
Sam, that's a good start.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.817
But I don't know how.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.088
Well, goddamned if I know!

34:17.321 --> 34:18.821
When did this happen?

34:19.524 --> 34:21.592
After the bachelor party.

34:21.592 --> 34:24.062
And what did you say to me right
when you left the bachelor party?

34:24.063 --> 34:26.397
Mind your own frickin' business.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.966
Shit.
Prick.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.367
So I go into this little
shop down in the Village,

34:31.370 --> 34:33.770
I talk to some funny old dude.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.172
I go home, I wake up in the
morning, and I'm a chick.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.534
Do you remember
where this place was?

34:38.543 --> 34:40.411
Well, I don't know exactly.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.882
Well, come on.

34:42.612 --> 34:44.083
Come on!

34:50.688 --> 34:53.157
So where's this magical shop?

34:53.158 --> 34:55.188
I'm telling you,
this is the street.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.794
Hmm. Sure.

34:58.529 --> 34:59.997
Um, excuse me.

34:59.998 --> 35:01.328
Hi, excuse me.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.171
I'm sorry, is there,
um, like a little

35:03.172 --> 35:05.538
bric-a-brac shop on this street?
A what?

35:05.539 --> 35:07.467
You know, like, um, uh,
a shop with like

35:07.473 --> 35:09.173
a whole bunch of old crap in it?

35:09.174 --> 35:10.844
In this neighborhood? Yeah.

35:10.845 --> 35:12.612
Yeah, maybe like 50 years ago.

35:12.613 --> 35:14.581
You know what the rent
is like around here?

35:17.682 --> 35:19.452
"You know what the
rent is like around here?"

35:19.453 --> 35:20.651
Nah-nah.

35:21.185 --> 35:22.545
Bric-a-brac?

35:22.554 --> 35:23.888
Okay, okay, fine.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.756
Maybe it's not this street.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.317
Maybe you're not Sam.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.486
I have patients in the
morning, and I'm gonna go.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.755
No, no, wait, okay, wait, wait.

35:30.762 --> 35:34.332
Just... Can we meet
tomorrow then at our spot?

35:34.333 --> 35:35.573
You know what I'm talking about?

35:35.574 --> 35:37.367
I do, but do you?

35:37.369 --> 35:39.539
Alice in Wonderland statue,
Central Park.

35:39.540 --> 35:41.338
Well?

35:41.340 --> 35:43.370
Dude, come on, deal?

35:45.877 --> 35:47.237
Cool.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.997
She even eats like him.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.143
Why, you got a problem?

36:13.771 --> 36:15.339
You're a pig.

36:15.340 --> 36:18.410
Yeah, well, I'm hungry.

36:19.710 --> 36:22.110
Hey, finished with that?

36:22.114 --> 36:23.314
No?

36:29.620 --> 36:30.990
All right, let's go
to your office.

36:30.991 --> 36:32.489
I want you to examine me.

36:33.591 --> 36:35.059
What?

36:35.060 --> 36:37.990
No! No.
Eww, no way!

36:37.996 --> 36:40.096
Maybe you can find something.

36:40.098 --> 36:41.728
Like my cock.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.800
No.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.502
Why the hell not?

36:45.504 --> 36:48.139
Because it's weird, that's why.

36:48.140 --> 36:50.470
I'm not looking for your cock.

36:50.475 --> 36:53.175
I'll send you
a referral or something.

36:53.178 --> 36:56.678
I don't want another
gynecologist, I want you.

36:56.682 --> 36:59.252
You're my best friend.
Nice talking to you.

37:06.225 --> 37:08.255
My gynecologist.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.390
I hear he's very good.

37:17.236 --> 37:19.396
Yo, Sey.

37:19.404 --> 37:22.940
Lulu, you are looking
lovely as usual.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.609
I'm sorry, who are you?

37:24.610 --> 37:27.840
Oh, Lulu, this is
Sam's cousin, Samantha.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.406
She's just filling in for Sam

37:29.414 --> 37:31.754
while he's off on
some little sabbatical.

37:31.755 --> 37:33.317
Family business.

37:33.318 --> 37:34.678
Oh.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.816
Oh, nothing serious.
Uh, but excuse me.

37:36.822 --> 37:40.491
I gotta take a leak.
A pee... A pi... Um...

37:40.492 --> 37:42.662
Gonna use
the little girl's room.

37:44.096 --> 37:46.696
She's quite a pistol, that one.

37:46.698 --> 37:50.268
Seymour, that girl
needs a makeover.

37:50.269 --> 37:53.099
She cannot meet my new
partner looking like that.

37:53.105 --> 37:55.365
You're absolutely right.
I'll speak to her.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.544
You know,
she's not from New York.

37:57.545 --> 37:59.342
Oh, where is she from?

37:59.344 --> 38:01.312
Uh, she's from, uh...

38:01.313 --> 38:04.113
Um, actually, I don't know
where she's from.

38:04.116 --> 38:07.546
Well, just make sure she
does something with herself.

38:07.552 --> 38:10.921
Yes, darling.
And Seymour,

38:10.922 --> 38:13.262
you haven't forgotten
our little toys

38:13.263 --> 38:16.327
for our rendezvous
later tonight?

38:16.328 --> 38:20.598
Or else you will feel
the sting of my spatula.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.799
No, I...

38:22.801 --> 38:24.301
I'm never without them.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.403
And besides, I love
the sting of your spatula.

38:26.405 --> 38:27.895
Mmm.

38:27.906 --> 38:30.406
I have got you trained
so well, don't I?

38:30.409 --> 38:32.239
Who's your little puppy?

38:32.244 --> 38:33.444
Mmm.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.005
Oh!

38:37.748 --> 38:39.118
Mmm.

38:41.519 --> 38:43.819
See you later. Mmm-hmm.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.360
Samantha?

38:51.363 --> 38:53.431
Oh! Down.
Do what?

38:53.432 --> 38:54.702
Get down.

38:54.703 --> 38:57.600
Okay, um, is this yours?

38:57.602 --> 39:00.271
Oh, yeah.

39:00.272 --> 39:01.639
Damned earring.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.170
I don't know how the hell
they wear these things.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.575
Oh, they fall out so easy.

39:05.577 --> 39:08.007
Listen, um, I know it's
sometimes rough starting

39:08.013 --> 39:11.513
a new job, but I think
you will like it here.

39:11.516 --> 39:15.486
Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh,
getting used to it already.

39:15.487 --> 39:20.057
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you, okay?

39:20.058 --> 39:22.028
Thanks, Margaret.
Yeah, thanks a lot.

39:22.029 --> 39:24.827
You know, us girls
gotta stick together.

39:24.830 --> 39:27.498
Um, yeah.

39:27.499 --> 39:30.929
Listen, um, have you
heard from Sam?

39:30.936 --> 39:33.636
Sam? Oh, God, are you okay?

39:33.638 --> 39:35.638
I mean, Samantha.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.140
Could I have a word
with you, please?

39:38.709 --> 39:40.409
Uh, yeah.

39:40.412 --> 39:42.012
Margaret.

39:44.782 --> 39:46.452
Thank you.
Gotcha.

39:47.351 --> 39:48.621
What's going on around here?

39:48.622 --> 39:50.050
Oh, shit.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.861
You're beside yourself.
What's going on?

39:53.862 --> 39:55.629
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

39:55.630 --> 39:59.527
Well, listen, we have this
very important presentation

39:59.531 --> 40:01.031
for Lulu coming up.

40:01.032 --> 40:03.601
Yeah, I know, I'm...
I'm working on it right now.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.872
Right, well, I need you
to do me a favor.

40:05.873 --> 40:08.471
I'd like you to go see my friend, Al.
He's a...

40:09.440 --> 40:11.609
He's an image consultant.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.077
Phew.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.078
You think I need
an image consultant?

40:15.080 --> 40:17.850
I mean, it couldn't hurt to let
him fix you up a little bit.

40:17.851 --> 40:19.919
I mean, on the company,
of course.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.787
Okay, if you... That's what
you think that I need.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.118
I mean, come on.

40:24.122 --> 40:27.291
All women love makeovers, right?

40:27.292 --> 40:30.027
I'm not all women, believe me.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.396
Oh, believe me, I believe you.

40:32.397 --> 40:33.997
I can see for myself.

40:33.999 --> 40:38.199
I mean, sometimes you seem
really tense, you know?

40:38.203 --> 40:39.370
Okay.

40:39.371 --> 40:41.701
What's the matter?
I give a great massage.

40:41.706 --> 40:43.636
Yeah, well, you know, I...

40:43.642 --> 40:45.876
Have very tender muscles.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.077
Tell me about it.

40:48.079 --> 40:49.949
I have a tender muscle
as we speak.

40:49.950 --> 40:51.508
Yeah, okay, so what...

40:51.516 --> 40:53.916
What kind of a makeover
were you thinking?

40:53.919 --> 40:56.919
Nah, just, you know,
maybe a little makeup.

40:56.922 --> 41:00.092
And hair and maybe a
little cleavage, you know.

41:00.093 --> 41:02.431
Something a little more
flattering down here.

41:02.432 --> 41:04.827
Okay, yeah, goddamn it, Seymour.

41:04.830 --> 41:07.600
What? You're a frickin'
octopus, you know that?

41:07.601 --> 41:11.068
Samantha, that language
is very unladylike.

41:11.069 --> 41:13.838
Oh, yeah? Who said
I'm a lady, huh?

41:13.839 --> 41:17.109
Look, I know you're upset. Come here.
I just wanna give you a hug.

41:17.110 --> 41:18.678
Hey, can I do anything for you?

41:18.679 --> 41:20.577
Yeah, yeah, you can.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.479
You can get me a frickin' gun.

41:24.182 --> 41:27.052
Wow. Very sensitive.

41:27.451 --> 41:28.921
Clearly.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.153
How 'bout you?

41:31.156 --> 41:32.816
How 'bout me what?

41:32.824 --> 41:34.724
Are you tense?

41:34.726 --> 41:37.026
Loose as a goose,
Mr. Cavalo.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.868
Shame.

41:51.443 --> 41:53.243
Yes, Miss, what can I get you?

41:53.245 --> 41:54.975
Okay, uh, let's see,

41:54.980 --> 41:57.149
a pint and a shot
of whiskey, please.

41:57.150 --> 41:59.517
And, um, actually,
can you give me the whiskey

41:59.518 --> 42:01.818
while you pour the pint?
Certainly.

42:03.754 --> 42:05.394
You look like you could use one.

42:06.123 --> 42:08.063
Here you go.
Enjoy.

42:10.794 --> 42:12.496
Oh.

42:12.497 --> 42:14.857
You know, I just love a woman

42:14.866 --> 42:17.926
who knows how to drink a drink.

42:17.936 --> 42:20.796
Are you ser... Seriously, dude,
just screw off, all right?

42:20.805 --> 42:22.465
You... You don't
have to get nasty.

42:22.474 --> 42:24.774
I was gonna buy you
the next one.

42:24.776 --> 42:26.076
Maybe two.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.777
Okay, you know what?
Barkeep, here.

42:28.780 --> 42:29.980
Cancel the pint.

42:31.248 --> 42:32.716
Screw off, man.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.547
Your loss, baby.

42:40.291 --> 42:43.431
Hi, may I offer you
some scotch and sofa?

42:51.001 --> 42:52.241
Oh.

43:02.113 --> 43:03.613
What is go...

43:03.615 --> 43:05.675
I'll get rid of whoever
it is, all right?

43:09.187 --> 43:11.187
Yah! Yes?

43:11.189 --> 43:12.556
Jesus.

43:14.559 --> 43:15.889
Doc.
Oh, no.

43:15.894 --> 43:17.728
Please, no.

43:17.729 --> 43:18.996
I'm bleeding.

43:18.997 --> 43:20.497
Now is not a good time.

43:20.498 --> 43:25.168
I have been hemorrhaging
all night down there.

43:25.170 --> 43:27.270
You're menstruating.
What?

43:27.272 --> 43:28.812
You're having your period.

43:28.813 --> 43:30.907
I'm riding the cotton pony?

43:30.909 --> 43:32.309
Andrew?

43:32.310 --> 43:34.110
Doesn't your colorful
friend realize

43:34.112 --> 43:35.582
that office hours haven't begun?

43:35.583 --> 43:37.380
Doc, what am I gonna do?

43:37.382 --> 43:38.782
Buy yourself some tampons.

43:38.783 --> 43:41.051
Oh, my God.

43:41.052 --> 43:42.886
Okay, you need
to leave right now.

43:42.887 --> 43:44.087
You need to... You need to
get out of here. Andrew,

43:44.089 --> 43:45.557
you should make her
leave this instant.

43:45.558 --> 43:47.057
Oh, she's still bossing
you around, huh?

43:47.058 --> 43:49.258
Oh! Andrew,
I can't believe

43:49.260 --> 43:52.460
that you are letting this
creature talk to me like that.

43:52.464 --> 43:54.064
"Oh, Andrew, I can't
believe you're allowing"

43:54.065 --> 43:55.595
"this creature to talk
to me like that."

43:55.600 --> 43:57.670
Fuck you and the horse
that you rode in on.

43:57.671 --> 44:00.169
Please, please! Do I
have to throw you out myself?

44:00.171 --> 44:02.539
Oh! Try it, bitch.

44:02.540 --> 44:04.810
I am warning you,
I do kickboxing.

44:04.811 --> 44:06.379
Chicks only hit chicks

44:06.380 --> 44:08.278
in the movies, am I right?

44:10.214 --> 44:12.349
Yeah?
Yeah!

44:12.350 --> 44:14.450
Stop it, stop, stop!

44:14.452 --> 44:16.120
Ah! Ow!

44:16.121 --> 44:17.988
Get off of me!

44:23.028 --> 44:24.128
Stop!

44:24.129 --> 44:26.029
Get her off of me!
God!

44:26.031 --> 44:27.361
No!

44:27.365 --> 44:30.195
All right, enough, enough!

44:30.201 --> 44:31.871
She started it!
She started it!

44:32.770 --> 44:35.200
Sam, I think you better go.

44:35.739 --> 44:37.508
Sam?

44:37.509 --> 44:39.309
Did you just call her Sam?

44:39.310 --> 44:42.046
Samantha, she's, uh,
Sam's cousin.

44:42.047 --> 44:43.447
Oh.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.648
Oh, okay, well, this
makes perfect sense.

44:45.650 --> 44:47.520
Shut up.
Why doesn't she go?

44:47.521 --> 44:50.988
Because she is my fiancee.

44:50.989 --> 44:53.989
And you are my patient.

44:53.992 --> 44:56.560
Don't ever do this again.

44:56.561 --> 44:58.030
Wait, no, can we just...

44:58.031 --> 44:59.398
Can we just talk about this?

44:59.399 --> 45:01.197
Later. Well, wait,
but later-later,

45:01.199 --> 45:04.029
or never-later?
Just go.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.265
Oh.

45:05.836 --> 45:06.996
Wait.

45:20.651 --> 45:23.321
Well, what am I supposed
to do with these?

45:33.597 --> 45:35.127
Great.

45:42.039 --> 45:44.169
You're her to see
Mr. Blondell?

45:44.175 --> 45:46.175
Yeah, yeah.

45:46.177 --> 45:48.677
Okay, he's with a client.

45:48.680 --> 45:50.250
I gotta get back.

45:56.019 --> 45:59.319
Whatever you do,
don't make a sound.

45:59.324 --> 46:02.794
And don't touch anything.

46:04.194 --> 46:05.964
Okay.

46:13.337 --> 46:14.867
Mother, isn't it just divine?

46:14.873 --> 46:16.243
It's... It's glorious.

46:16.244 --> 46:18.709
Shall I wrap it?
Alexander?

46:18.710 --> 46:21.410
I can see clear now
that my work is done here.

46:22.680 --> 46:25.010
Thank you, Alexander.
You're wonderful.

46:25.016 --> 46:27.376
Mwah, mwah.

46:27.385 --> 46:29.385
Thank you.
Mwah, mwah.

46:29.387 --> 46:32.117
Come on, honey,
you look gorgeous!

46:34.024 --> 46:36.034
Oh, Marie, pretty box.

46:44.701 --> 46:46.571
Oh, and don't forget the purse!

46:55.479 --> 46:57.879
You're Samantha,
my 1:30.

46:58.415 --> 47:00.345
Yeah, no.

47:00.351 --> 47:02.419
No, I'm a...

47:02.420 --> 47:04.250
I'm a...
I gotta go.

47:04.255 --> 47:05.485
Come here.

47:05.490 --> 47:07.220
Okay, look, pal...

47:07.225 --> 47:08.755
I am not pal.

47:08.760 --> 47:10.828
I am Alexander Blondell.

47:10.829 --> 47:12.859
Cool, uh, look, Al...

47:12.864 --> 47:15.098
Mr. Blondell.

47:15.099 --> 47:19.136
Blondie.
Mr. Blondell.

47:19.137 --> 47:21.767
Okay, well, this is
clearly a mistake.

47:21.773 --> 47:23.113
I don't make mistakes.

47:23.114 --> 47:25.507
I make miracles.
And, my dear,

47:25.510 --> 47:28.640
you are in desperate
need of one.

47:28.646 --> 47:31.846
Now come here.
I don't bite.

47:31.850 --> 47:34.420
Unless you displease me.

47:38.755 --> 47:39.915
Turn around.

47:43.527 --> 47:44.787
Gum.

47:51.368 --> 47:52.938
Hmm...

47:53.570 --> 47:54.800
Hmm.

47:54.806 --> 47:56.236
Hmm.

47:56.241 --> 47:57.941
Is...
No, det-det-det-det.

47:57.942 --> 48:00.110
I'm evaluating you.

48:00.111 --> 48:02.141
Skin, repulsive.

48:02.146 --> 48:03.306
Nails, oh, my God,

48:03.314 --> 48:05.054
what are you a migrant worker?

48:05.055 --> 48:06.619
That hair.

48:08.085 --> 48:10.045
Did you just throw up? Mmm.

48:10.054 --> 48:12.923
I do believe that covers
the preliminaries.

48:12.924 --> 48:14.424
Okay, cool,
so what's the deal then?

48:14.425 --> 48:15.925
Did I pass or what?

48:15.927 --> 48:18.357
If you had passed, there would
be nothing for us to do.

48:19.697 --> 48:21.227
My studio, tomorrow,
3:00 p.m.,

48:21.232 --> 48:22.902
and let's do try
to be on time now.

48:22.903 --> 48:24.101
Shall we?

48:25.035 --> 48:28.235
Marie, do something.

48:33.944 --> 48:37.614
Yes, there is such a
thing as an overheated balance.

48:37.615 --> 48:39.345
Look at it!

48:39.350 --> 48:41.580
No, I do not want puce.
I do not want pilot.

48:41.586 --> 48:43.016
It's all...
It looks like a...

48:43.021 --> 48:44.851
<i>Entrez, entrez!</i>

48:44.856 --> 48:47.056
It looks like
a bad Picasso, really.

48:47.058 --> 48:48.928
No, I don't mean to insult you.
I know he's fantastic.

48:48.929 --> 48:51.287
He's a wonderful
designer, but I...

48:51.296 --> 48:53.526
Oh, oh, my God.

48:53.531 --> 48:55.399
I'll have to call you back.

48:55.400 --> 48:57.600
My 3:00 lump of clay
has arrived.

48:58.702 --> 49:00.472
Be a dear, put this on.

49:03.207 --> 49:05.267
Uh, yeah, man, listen, uh,

49:05.276 --> 49:07.306
I'm not here for dance lessons.

49:07.312 --> 49:10.052
Oh, honey, after 30
years in choreography,

49:10.053 --> 49:14.117
the last thing I want to do is
to give you a dance lesson.

49:14.118 --> 49:18.448
I am here to teach you
to be a girl.

49:18.456 --> 49:19.786
What?
Oh, you know,

49:19.791 --> 49:21.391
pink ribbons and petticoats.

49:21.392 --> 49:22.630
Should I try bangs?

49:22.631 --> 49:24.187
Let's bake brownies
and call boys.

49:24.195 --> 49:25.795
You're kidding, right?

49:25.797 --> 49:29.027
Oh, don't think of it as losing
your Quasimodo posture or...

49:30.435 --> 49:32.095
that hair.

49:32.103 --> 49:35.203
Think of it as gaining
a new sense of style.

49:35.206 --> 49:36.866
Not to mention
a brand-new arsenal

49:36.874 --> 49:38.909
in the war between the sexes.

49:38.910 --> 49:41.178
Yeah, see, dude, uh,

49:41.179 --> 49:42.949
my sexes are
warring enough, so...

49:42.950 --> 49:44.077
No.

49:44.082 --> 49:45.312
No.
No!

49:53.090 --> 49:57.290
My "galdar" tells me
you like to wager.

49:57.295 --> 49:59.225
I'm sorry, did you say "galdar"?

49:59.230 --> 50:03.630
Yes, it's like gaydar except
it reads women flawlessly.

50:03.634 --> 50:05.068
Hmm.

50:05.069 --> 50:07.269
You like to bet.

50:07.271 --> 50:08.971
Yeah, I mean, I've, uh,

50:08.973 --> 50:10.273
I've shuffled a deck or two.

50:10.274 --> 50:11.744
Well, I've got a wager for you.

50:11.745 --> 50:15.443
If after two weeks with me,
you're not knocking them dead,

50:15.446 --> 50:17.346
I'll pay you my fee.

50:18.415 --> 50:19.945
All right, pal, you're on.

50:19.951 --> 50:22.051
Okay, I detect a pattern here.

50:22.053 --> 50:25.453
It's not pal, it's not dude, it's Mr.
Blondell.

50:25.456 --> 50:28.416
M-I-S-T-E-R
B-L-O-N-D-E-L-L.

50:28.426 --> 50:30.456
All right, whatever.
Now put this on.

50:30.461 --> 50:32.831
No, dude, I...
I'm not wearing a tutu.

50:32.832 --> 50:35.970
It is not a tutu, now put it on.

50:40.337 --> 50:42.437
Okay, fine, whatever.

50:42.440 --> 50:44.710
Where do you want me
to put on the fucking tutu?

50:46.810 --> 50:48.078
Oh, man.

50:48.079 --> 50:50.779
You can wash your mouth out,
you little slut.

50:50.782 --> 50:53.550
Any time before Armageddon
will be fine.

50:53.551 --> 50:56.451
Ugh! Dude, seriously,
I'm not coming out in this.

50:56.454 --> 50:59.224
Come out, come out,
whatever you are.

51:06.530 --> 51:08.530
To the mirror.

51:08.533 --> 51:11.401
To the mirror.

51:11.402 --> 51:13.236
Tutu's creeping up my butt.

51:13.237 --> 51:15.067
Not a pleasant journey
for the Lycra, now is it?

51:15.073 --> 51:17.343
Hands out of your leotard.

51:19.209 --> 51:21.979
Look at yourself.
What do you see?

51:23.146 --> 51:25.076
Um...

51:25.083 --> 51:26.620
I don't know, I see someone

51:26.621 --> 51:28.777
who should've left
ten minutes ago?

51:30.854 --> 51:32.289
I see beauty.

51:32.290 --> 51:33.790
Just the very inkling of it.

51:33.791 --> 51:38.291
First little bud pushing
its head above the earth.

51:38.296 --> 51:39.796
But it is there.

51:41.064 --> 51:42.734
And for the next two weeks,

51:42.735 --> 51:48.803
you and I are going
to feed it and water it

51:48.806 --> 51:52.906
and grow it into the most magnificent
flower of feminine exquisiteness

51:52.910 --> 51:56.050
since Audrey Hepburn had her
breakfast at Tiffany's.

51:56.051 --> 51:59.647
And so, my little gamine,

51:59.650 --> 52:02.690
do you have the courage
to bloom?

52:04.554 --> 52:06.690
Uh, um...

52:06.691 --> 52:08.661
I don't know, would it make
a difference if I said no?

52:08.662 --> 52:10.389
Absolutely not.

52:10.394 --> 52:12.034
Let's get started.

53:30.774 --> 53:33.384
All right, Mrs. Smith?

53:47.490 --> 53:48.590
No.

53:49.125 --> 53:50.725
Doc, you okay?

53:50.728 --> 53:52.328
- No.
- Doc.

53:52.330 --> 53:53.430
- No.
- Doc!

53:53.431 --> 53:54.731
No.

53:54.732 --> 53:55.932
Doc?

54:02.739 --> 54:06.539
Doc, please just hear me out.
No.

54:06.544 --> 54:09.354
Doc, please.

54:10.447 --> 54:12.207
You have five minutes.

54:12.216 --> 54:13.446
Well, I paid for an hour.

54:13.451 --> 54:15.451
I'll reimburse you.

54:16.386 --> 54:18.616
Four minutes, 50 seconds.

54:18.623 --> 54:20.192
Why don't you start
by telling me

54:20.193 --> 54:22.729
what the hell
you're doing in my office?

54:22.730 --> 54:25.227
Well, I tried calling you.
I've tried e-mailing you.

54:25.229 --> 54:26.829
It's been two weeks!

54:26.831 --> 54:29.566
I was hoping
you'd get the message.

54:29.567 --> 54:31.397
What message?
The message...

54:31.402 --> 54:35.772
That my life was fine
before you happened!

54:35.773 --> 54:37.307
And totally screwed
everything up.

54:37.308 --> 54:38.668
Did you think
I was just gonna forget

54:38.676 --> 54:41.736
how you nearly broke up
Cynthia and I?

54:41.746 --> 54:44.206
Doc, we're dudes.

54:44.215 --> 54:46.545
We fight, get drunk,
and then make up.

54:47.517 --> 54:50.387
We are not dudes, Sam!

54:50.388 --> 54:54.618
Only one of us is a dude!
That's the problem!

54:55.993 --> 54:59.229
That's always going
to be the problem.

54:59.230 --> 55:01.460
Don't you think that
I'm sick of this, too?

55:01.465 --> 55:04.195
Hearing Alvin the Chipmunk
coming out of my mouth

55:04.201 --> 55:05.531
every time I speak?

55:05.536 --> 55:08.836
Having this face staring
back at me every morning!

55:08.839 --> 55:12.609
Okay, relax,
it's not such a bad face.

55:12.610 --> 55:14.440
Maybe you could get used to it.

55:14.445 --> 55:15.935
No, Doc, no.

55:15.946 --> 55:17.846
I'm not gonna get used to this.

55:17.848 --> 55:20.048
I don't wanna live
this life anymore.

55:20.051 --> 55:22.581
Hey, don't talk like that.

55:24.388 --> 55:28.418
You know about... About
drugs and hormone therapy

55:28.426 --> 55:31.256
and all that, so...

55:31.262 --> 55:33.332
I don't know, maybe
if I was a dude again,

55:33.333 --> 55:36.299
then everything
would just be okay.

55:36.300 --> 55:38.970
You know, maybe we could
go back to being friends.

55:41.271 --> 55:43.711
You're serious.
As a heart attack.

55:45.775 --> 55:47.375
What you're talking about

55:47.378 --> 55:49.708
requires a lot more
than hormones.

55:52.515 --> 55:53.615
How much more?

55:53.617 --> 55:55.177
We're talking about
serious stuff.

55:55.186 --> 55:57.546
I mean, it's a full sex change.

55:57.555 --> 56:00.385
Major, major stuff.

56:00.391 --> 56:01.961
How major we talking?

56:15.906 --> 56:17.566
You okay?

56:20.310 --> 56:21.840
You sure you wanna do this?

56:24.914 --> 56:27.150
Give it some time, okay?

56:27.151 --> 56:28.881
Take a minute.

56:28.886 --> 56:30.416
How about we...

56:30.421 --> 56:33.391
We just think it over and...

56:37.928 --> 56:39.328
Okay.

56:39.330 --> 56:42.400
Let's just keep this between
the two of us, all right?

56:44.501 --> 56:46.031
Mum's the word, pal.

56:49.339 --> 56:51.608
You know, I am...
I'm starving.

56:51.609 --> 56:54.377
Wanna grab a bite?

56:54.378 --> 56:56.078
And the man at the store
insisted that the ring

56:56.080 --> 56:58.248
was two carats, but I swear it
was a karat and a half at most,

56:58.249 --> 56:59.779
and I wanted it yellow backed, anyway.

56:59.784 --> 57:01.622
Oh, and get a medial dome
to go with the blooming veil.

57:01.623 --> 57:03.589
I mean, a Y-dome would just get lost
in that kind of a dress, you know?

57:03.590 --> 57:05.087
Oh, my God.
What?

57:05.955 --> 57:08.415
I understood them.
Who?

57:08.892 --> 57:10.660
Them.

57:10.661 --> 57:12.901
I understood
what they said, I...

57:12.902 --> 57:16.027
Doc, I speak woman.
Or, is it "womanese"?

57:17.301 --> 57:18.601
Okay, you know what?
Five bucks.

57:18.602 --> 57:19.972
Five bucks says
I know what they said.

57:19.973 --> 57:21.970
Yeah?
You're on.

57:21.972 --> 57:23.612
What'd they say?

57:37.487 --> 57:39.017
Uh, excuse me, I...

57:39.023 --> 57:40.790
Ladies, I'm sorry,

57:40.791 --> 57:42.991
I don't mean to be rude. I kinda
have a bet going with a friend,

57:42.993 --> 57:44.333
and I just wanted
to ask you guys,

57:44.334 --> 57:46.698
are you talking about
matching a yellow diamond

57:46.699 --> 57:48.427
with a blue veil?

57:48.432 --> 57:50.132
As a matter of fact,
we were, but...

57:50.134 --> 57:52.204
Who the hell told
you that anyway?

57:53.636 --> 57:54.836
Him.

57:57.006 --> 57:58.766
Check, please!

58:07.584 --> 58:10.753
Where'd you learn
to eat like that?

58:10.754 --> 58:11.954
Been taking lessons.

58:17.627 --> 58:20.997
It's really good to see you
smile for a change.

58:23.567 --> 58:26.567
So, am I allowed to ask
about you and you-know-who?

58:26.570 --> 58:27.640
No.

58:30.740 --> 58:32.670
We're fine, okay?

58:33.810 --> 58:36.610
She's fine.
That good, huh?

58:36.614 --> 58:38.952
Okay, okay, okay, I'm...
Look, I'm behaving.

58:38.953 --> 58:40.279
This is me behaving.

58:42.652 --> 58:44.621
What?

58:44.622 --> 58:46.152
Nothing.

58:49.826 --> 58:52.226
Um...

58:53.329 --> 58:56.199
In the office, uh,

58:56.200 --> 58:58.570
did you really mean
what you said about me

58:58.571 --> 59:00.569
not looking so bad?

59:00.571 --> 59:02.201
Fishing for compliments?

59:02.206 --> 59:03.366
Whatever, forget it.

59:05.475 --> 59:07.135
I...

59:07.144 --> 59:09.679
I, uh, meant what I said.

59:09.680 --> 59:13.850
You look pretty okay.

59:15.652 --> 59:18.552
I look pretty okay
or I look pretty, okay?

59:18.556 --> 59:20.156
You know what I mean.

59:20.157 --> 59:23.327
And for the record, you don't
sound like Alvin the Chipmunk.

59:24.761 --> 59:27.030
I don't, really?

59:27.031 --> 59:29.501
Theodore, maybe.

59:34.003 --> 59:36.839
Hey, um...

59:36.840 --> 59:40.009
I need you to explain
something to me.

59:40.010 --> 59:42.178
The doctor is in.

59:42.179 --> 59:44.547
I, uh...

59:44.548 --> 59:46.148
I need you to explain to me

59:46.150 --> 59:50.150
why there is nothing
happening down there.

59:50.154 --> 59:51.921
You skipped your period.

59:51.922 --> 59:53.522
What?
Oh, my God.

59:53.524 --> 59:56.124
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

59:56.126 --> 59:58.056
I, um...

59:58.062 --> 01:00:01.062
You know, there's
nothing happening.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:03.065
What?
Oh, God.

01:00:03.067 --> 01:00:05.227
You know,
I look at girls, nothing.

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:07.865
I look at guys, nothing.
I look at porn, nothing.

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.565
So, what am I, frigid?

01:00:10.574 --> 01:00:12.114
Do I have some kind
of mental problems?

01:00:12.115 --> 01:00:14.077
I mean...

01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:16.478
I don't know, I feel
like a fucking female eunuch.

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.450
What? What?
A little louder.

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:22.551
I don't think they heard
you in Cleveland. Tsk.

01:00:22.553 --> 01:00:23.893
Look...

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.656
It's complex.

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:28.187
Complex?

01:00:28.192 --> 01:00:30.730
You touch 'em in the right
spot, they get hot.

01:00:30.731 --> 01:00:32.658
Some women can achieve
full arousal

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:33.930
as quickly as men.

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:35.198
Most can't.

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:37.099
Yeah, but that's just plumbing.

01:00:37.101 --> 01:00:40.136
It takes them
a little longer to warm up,

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:42.167
but with me, there's just
like nothing happening.

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:43.710
Women have
a completely different

01:00:43.711 --> 01:00:45.537
mind-body connection
than men.

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:47.542
Their arousal is more subtle.

01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:49.612
It's more intricate.

01:00:49.613 --> 01:00:52.613
Which, translated from New Age
psychobabble, means what?

01:00:52.616 --> 01:00:54.876
They have to really like
the person they're with

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:56.275
to feel fully aroused.

01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:58.986
Let's face it,
women are complicated.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.089
Yeah, you're telling me.

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:05.587
Oh, shoot.

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:08.331
The office.

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:10.272
Meeting got pushed up.
I gotta go.

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:15.099
No.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.805
What's wrong?

01:01:16.807 --> 01:01:18.237
Can, um...

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:19.942
Can I just call you later

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:23.012
and maybe talk more
about the issue?

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.547
Sure.

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:27.778
Just, uh, remember
to stay out of trouble.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:29.315
Promise.

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:31.049
Cross my tits and hope to die.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:34.720
See ya.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:50.106
You look so nice, Samantha.

01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:52.837
Thanks, Margaret.
So do you.

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:55.143
Okay, they're waiting for you
in the conference room.

01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:57.145
I punched up the graphics
in the proposal.

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.047
Added some extras.

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:02.176
Wow.

01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:03.716
Nice work, Margaret.

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:12.729
Well, she certainly
cleans up nicely.

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:14.230
You look...

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:15.761
Stunning.

01:02:15.766 --> 01:02:18.296
I... I mean stun-ning.

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:20.942
Uh, come over here
and sit next to Seymour.

01:02:20.943 --> 01:02:23.968
I'm fine right over here.

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:28.244
Allow me to introduce
my joint venture partner,

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.175
Jean Georges Verham.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.150
<i>Le Conte de Cassis.</i>

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:34.816
Exquisite.

01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:36.418
It is truly my pleasure.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.220
Um, uh, thank you.

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:41.922
Have you ever beheld
the Seine at night?

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:45.525
The bridges alight.
A place for lovers.

01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:47.829
Well, you're in Manhattan now,
Jean Georges.

01:02:47.831 --> 01:02:52.131
Yes, can we please begin
the presentation, please?

01:02:52.136 --> 01:02:55.696
Perhaps we could meet
a bit later?

01:02:55.706 --> 01:02:57.436
Oh, you know, um...

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.141
I'm... I'm very busy
right now.

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:01.483
My schedule is just
filling up very rapidly.

01:03:01.484 --> 01:03:04.447
Hmm, <i>quel dommage, ma petite.</i>

01:03:05.716 --> 01:03:07.846
Samantha, as I recall,

01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:11.220
you had some wonderful ideas
about our Internet campaign?

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:13.489
Oh, yes.

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:14.857
And before I begin,

01:03:14.858 --> 01:03:16.758
I would like to just say
thank you

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.390
to Margaret
for all the wonderful work

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:20.255
that she did on these reports.

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:24.765
Now, as you can see
from this chart,

01:03:24.768 --> 01:03:28.137
the models that we used on
this season's online campaign

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:33.068
scored highest between
the ages of 34 and 44.

01:03:33.076 --> 01:03:34.906
And the numbers start
to lessen as we...

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:37.512
Seymour, darling,

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:39.982
if you do not remove your nose

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.983
from Samantha's, admittedly,

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:44.745
attractive derriere
immediately...

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:50.860
I will not be tying you up
or spanking you tonight,

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:53.196
or any other night,

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:56.397
and you will lose my account.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.267
Are we perfectly clear?

01:03:58.268 --> 01:03:59.368
Perfectly clear.

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:01.637
Oh, good.
Mwah.

01:04:01.638 --> 01:04:03.919
Certain things that
are gonna get men's attention.

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:05.441
Great.

01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:07.510
Fabulous.

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:09.478
Gorgeous.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:11.379
An excellent presentation, Sam.

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:12.911
May I call you Sam?

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:14.776
I prefer it, actually.

01:04:14.785 --> 01:04:17.285
We will be in touch
about the details.

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.017
I look forward to it.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:22.422
I think this calls
for a little promotion.

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:24.126
We'll go over the specifics
in my office.

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:26.557
Cocktails mandatory.

01:04:26.563 --> 01:04:28.233
How about we skip the cocktails

01:04:28.234 --> 01:04:30.800
and settle on 20% raise? Huh?

01:04:30.801 --> 01:04:32.869
Well, then I would be
earning as much as Sam

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:34.940
for doing the exact same job.
Yeah, well, that's...

01:04:34.941 --> 01:04:38.068
A raise, I think
that's a capital idea.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:40.075
And a bonus, too.

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:42.877
I mean, after all,
she's earned it, hasn't she?

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.510
I suppose we could do
a bonus, but...

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:47.315
Seymour...

01:04:47.317 --> 01:04:50.047
Remember our little
understanding, don't you?

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.387
Oh, of course.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:54.218
Everything's perfectly clear,
my little tigress.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:56.592
Mmm...

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:58.027
Meow, baby.

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:08.143
I think a raise this big
deserves a hug.

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:12.905
Ah, you don't know
what you're missing.

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:15.080
Oh, I'm pretty sure I do.

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:18.275
And another thing.

01:05:18.282 --> 01:05:21.250
That promotion,
it's going to Margaret.

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:23.251
Huh? It is?

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:25.721
Yeah, she earned it.

01:05:25.722 --> 01:05:27.392
Actually, she should've
gotten it three years ago,

01:05:27.393 --> 01:05:28.891
but you and Sam were too busy

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:31.462
stealing all of her ideas
to give it to her.

01:05:31.463 --> 01:05:34.130
I don't know about that.

01:05:34.131 --> 01:05:35.531
I do.

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:37.432
And I'm sure Lulu
would love to hear

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.704
about Margaret's contributions
over the years.

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:41.943
You would do that?

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.273
Us girls have to stick together.

01:05:48.577 --> 01:05:49.707
Uh...

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.980
Samantha.

01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:54.417
Hey, Margaret.

01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:56.278
You know, you didn't need
to say that about me

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.386
in the meeting
and to Mr. Cavalo.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.216
Actually, I did.

01:06:01.224 --> 01:06:03.759
I don't know how to thank you.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.297
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.698
Um, I have a favor.
Maybe I shouldn't ask.

01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:12.501
No, of course,
of course, anything.

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:15.071
Um, if you speak
with your cousin,

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:16.572
would you tell him
something for me?

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:19.106
Of course.

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:20.909
Would you tell him
that, you know,

01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:25.381
I think about him every day
and I really miss him.

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:26.816
You do?

01:06:26.817 --> 01:06:29.117
Sure, he's a...
He's a really great guy.

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:32.689
He was? Is?

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:35.091
Yeah, uh...

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:38.062
Tell you the truth, I have
the worst crush on him.

01:06:38.063 --> 01:06:42.461
And, um, why is that?

01:06:42.466 --> 01:06:46.466
He played like he didn't care
about anyone special, but...

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:48.970
I knew it was just an act.

01:06:48.972 --> 01:06:51.342
Deep down, he has a
really romantic heart.

01:06:51.343 --> 01:06:53.741
A girl can just see
these things.

01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:55.782
Oh, and please, don't tell him

01:06:55.783 --> 01:06:58.079
I said that about
the romantic stuff.

01:06:58.081 --> 01:07:00.621
And thanks again.

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:02.820
Of course.

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:31.112
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:33.454
That feels good, Sam.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.947
Sam?
Mmm.

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:44.060
What is it, Soo-Soo?

01:07:44.061 --> 01:07:47.096
You, you just called me Sam.

01:07:47.097 --> 01:07:49.157
No, I didn't.

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:51.466
Yes, you most certainly did.

01:07:51.468 --> 01:07:55.068
What the... What the hell
is going on right now?

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:57.640
What are you talking about?

01:07:57.641 --> 01:07:59.410
Is it that cousin of his?

01:07:59.411 --> 01:08:01.779
That little tramp
that showed up here

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:04.348
faking her period?
She wasn't faking it.

01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:06.077
Oh, so now you're defending her?

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:07.450
No, what, I...

01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:08.951
You're... That's not
what I said, I...

01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:11.748
Oh, my God.

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:13.315
Oh, my God, you're gay!

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.457
What?
That's it!

01:08:17.461 --> 01:08:20.595
I've been a perfect fool.

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:24.197
You and Mr. Sleazebag have
been having a secret affair

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:25.901
behind my back,
and all this time

01:08:25.902 --> 01:08:27.902
I thought you were straight!

01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:29.371
Oh, my God!

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:31.006
Oh, my God!

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:33.341
Oh, my God.

01:08:33.343 --> 01:08:36.511
You, you might be
one really good actor,

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:40.116
but you are one lousy
human being.

01:08:40.117 --> 01:08:42.417
I'm straight.

01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:43.849
Can we just talk this over?

01:08:43.854 --> 01:08:45.754
There's nothing to talk about.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:47.154
Good-bye!

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.057
Don't be like this!

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:51.560
You're making things up.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.595
Oh.
Can we just communicate?

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:55.256
What...
Sit down for a second.

01:08:55.265 --> 01:08:57.194
We'll talk...
You make me sick!

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.667
Get over yourself, man.

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:07.812
Soo-Soo...

01:09:07.813 --> 01:09:09.841
Boo-Boo is sorry.

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:18.685
Shit.

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:29.158
So how bad a fight was it?

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:31.666
I didn't say we had a fight.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.268
You didn't have to.

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:36.100
You got that
post-fight look.

01:09:36.106 --> 01:09:38.435
Droopy shoulders, a little
mopey around the edges.

01:09:38.441 --> 01:09:41.441
Sam, I don't wanna
talk about it.

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:43.514
All right, fine, man,
suit yourself.

01:09:46.983 --> 01:09:49.151
Hey, dude.

01:09:49.152 --> 01:09:50.752
What about me?

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:52.354
What about you?

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.585
Well, I might be
a few pounds lighter,

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:54.890
but I can still
catch a football.

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:58.327
Sam, we don't play
tackle football with women.

01:09:58.328 --> 01:09:59.588
End of discussion.

01:09:59.596 --> 01:10:01.326
Dude, I still got
the chops, come...

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:02.861
Case closed.

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:05.827
Sexist pig.

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:07.865
I heard that.

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:16.837
Ready?
Yeah, I guess so.

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:20.376
All right, guys,
let's play some football!

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:21.552
Yeah, this chick...

01:10:21.553 --> 01:10:22.621
Her name's Samantha.

01:10:22.622 --> 01:10:24.549
She's Sam's cousin.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:25.654
Yeah, Steve.

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:27.755
Sam's told me
all about you, dude.

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:29.787
Congratulations on the
wedding, by the way.

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:30.993
From what Sam tells me,

01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:33.529
you're getting, uh,
quite a girl.

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:35.000
Okay.

01:10:35.001 --> 01:10:36.498
Quite a girl.

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:38.199
Are you kidding about playing?

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:41.001
Yeah, she's kidding.
No, no, she's not kidding.

01:10:41.004 --> 01:10:43.104
We're all great football
players in my family.

01:10:43.106 --> 01:10:45.636
And believe me, guys,
I know how to handle a ball.

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:49.607
I'm sure you do.

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:51.280
One play. No.

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:53.719
Just give me one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.817
Okay, let's let her play,
one play.

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:57.649
Come on, let's go.
You're overruled.

01:10:57.654 --> 01:10:58.854
Come on, one play.

01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:00.355
- Let's do it.
- Come on, guys.

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:01.887
Red team, ball.

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:03.859
Whoo!

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.730
I hope you're better than Sam!
Team!

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:09.459
Set, hike.

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:14.798
Oh, got it!
Oh, shit!

01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:20.309
You, fucking, Steve!
You get off of me!

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:22.310
Steve, stop grabbing my ass!

01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:25.213
- Fucker!
- Wait, what?

01:11:25.215 --> 01:11:27.145
Get off, Steve!

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:28.517
God!

01:11:28.518 --> 01:11:30.448
Save it for Georgette! What?

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:31.821
You better shut this girl up.

01:11:31.822 --> 01:11:33.491
No, I know how much
you like the ass play.

01:11:33.492 --> 01:11:35.257
Relax. Come on.

01:11:35.258 --> 01:11:36.788
No, you know what, I don't even
know why you're hanging out

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.562
with this bitch instead
of Cynthia anyway.

01:11:38.563 --> 01:11:40.061
Don't call her a bitch, Stephen.

01:11:40.063 --> 01:11:41.330
Oh, she's a bitch.

01:11:41.331 --> 01:11:42.831
Okay, so now I'm a bitch.

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:44.532
Oh, you're a Grade A bitch.

01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:46.504
I told you not
to call her a bitch.

01:11:46.505 --> 01:11:48.470
Oh, sorry, little bitch.

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:50.411
- Guys, guys...
- Fucking asshole.

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:52.808
Fight!

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.739
Relax, come on, relax.

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:57.484
Listen, come on, we're all friends.
Shake hands, come on.

01:11:58.747 --> 01:12:00.647
Uh-huh.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:01.820
We're friends.

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:07.655
Doc.

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.487
Come on, man, it's okay.
Let it go.

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:10.792
No.

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:13.494
It's not okay, all right?

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:16.356
Nothing is okay.

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:17.496
Doc.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.867
You were right.

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:20.736
She left me!

01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:22.397
Are you happy now?

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:25.806
Come on, man,
can we just chat about it?

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:28.577
No, just go home.

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:30.078
All right, I'm sick of you.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.680
Hey, what about the game?

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.682
Samantha?

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:39.022
I want her on my team next time.

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:44.532
Shit.

01:12:51.433 --> 01:12:54.503
Ugh!
Bunch of assholes!

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:55.974
Freakin' Steve.

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:20.657
Peace offering.

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:35.568
Listen, Doc, um...

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:39.107
I know that Cynthia
and I don't get along,

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:42.538
but if she's what
you want, then...

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:45.875
Lately, I don't know
what I want.

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:50.586
I do know I am sick of getting
my balls busted by her.

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:52.617
Well, at least you have balls.

01:14:54.756 --> 01:14:57.016
Oh, God.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.660
You're having a muscle spasm.

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:00.962
No, it's fine, it's fine.

01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:02.034
I'll just take some aspirin.

01:15:02.035 --> 01:15:04.631
Who's the doctor here?
Lay down.

01:15:04.634 --> 01:15:06.204
Come on.

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:09.571
Turn over.

01:15:09.572 --> 01:15:11.106
Okay.

01:15:11.107 --> 01:15:12.437
Right there?

01:15:12.442 --> 01:15:13.876
Oh, God, yeah.

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:15.607
How does that feel?

01:15:15.612 --> 01:15:17.952
Oh, much better.

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:21.348
Mmm.

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:28.390
I, um...

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:30.191
I have to use the John.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:31.263
Oh...

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:44.741
Oh, my God.

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.608
She's alive.

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:01.957
You?

01:16:01.958 --> 01:16:04.588
Yes, me.

01:16:04.594 --> 01:16:07.164
The doorman was kind enough
to let me up.

01:16:07.165 --> 01:16:11.733
And, um, I think
it's time that, um,

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:13.734
you know, you and I
had a little talk.

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:17.536
Uh, what would you
like to talk about?

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:21.009
The fact that you stole my man,

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:23.540
and I'd like him back.

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:28.776
Decent men in this city
are few and far between.

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:33.745
Decent, straight, unmarried
ones are even rarer.

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:35.886
Oh, you forgot rich.

01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:42.798
Women like me, okay,
successful career women.

01:16:42.799 --> 01:16:45.767
Women who think about tomorrow.

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:47.968
Women who plan maybe five,

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:49.901
ten years ahead in their life,

01:16:49.906 --> 01:16:54.636
we sometimes, we have to settle.

01:16:54.644 --> 01:16:55.978
Settle?

01:16:55.979 --> 01:16:58.679
Settle, or were you
born yesterday?

01:16:58.681 --> 01:17:00.211
Actually, about a month ago.

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:06.588
Andrew is...
He's well-bred, okay?

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:08.019
He's handsome,

01:17:08.024 --> 01:17:11.760
he's got all the right
credentials, and...

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:15.161
He's gonna make an excellent
father to our children.

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:17.604
Wow, you got it all planned
out, don't you, sister?

01:17:17.605 --> 01:17:19.630
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:22.136
And he doesn't get
a say in any of this?

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:24.738
No, he doesn't.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.776
But you do.

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:29.477
Which brings me

01:17:29.479 --> 01:17:31.409
to the point of my visit.

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:32.881
Oh?

01:17:32.882 --> 01:17:34.982
How much?

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:36.584
What?

01:17:36.586 --> 01:17:37.986
You heard me.

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:40.347
How much do you want
to, uh, let him go?

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:49.097
I'm sorry, are you
trying to buy me off?

01:17:49.098 --> 01:17:53.068
I mean, you're obviously
the type, you know?

01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:56.138
I mean, if it walks
like a duck...

01:17:56.139 --> 01:17:58.039
How would you like me
to belt you

01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:00.211
in the mouth like a duck?
Okay...

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:04.951
Andrew.

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:11.149
I... I'm...
I'm so sorry.

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:16.215
Just please...
Please what?

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:18.125
Bark?

01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:19.787
Roll over?

01:18:19.796 --> 01:18:22.326
Play dead?

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:25.531
We are so...

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:28.172
done

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:34.407
Okay.

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:37.079
All right, well, when you change
your mind and you come begging,

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.380
don't bother calling, okay,

01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:39.711
because I'm changing my number.

01:18:39.716 --> 01:18:41.916
Change your hairstyle
while you're at it.

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:43.617
Ugh...

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:45.049
It's really not a good...

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:46.994
look on her, you know?

01:18:51.294 --> 01:18:54.529
Look, Doc, I would say
that I'm sorry,

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:57.000
but, you know, I'm...
I'm just... I'm just not.

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:01.602
Please.

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:06.769
You just did me
the biggest favor of my life.

01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:08.036
Yeah?

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:13.677
Were you really gonna belt her?

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:16.151
Hell, yeah.

01:19:16.152 --> 01:19:18.022
Spunky little thing, aren't you?

01:19:19.889 --> 01:19:21.359
In a manner of speaking.

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.997
Damn.
What?

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:31.198
I just realized I don't have
a date to Steve's wedding.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.365
You're still going
to that thing?

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.970
You saw, we shook.

01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:39.173
Well, I would go
with you only...

01:19:39.175 --> 01:19:40.835
You are going with me.

01:19:40.843 --> 01:19:42.381
Yeah, man, I don't really think

01:19:42.382 --> 01:19:43.838
that Steve would
be cool with that.

01:19:43.846 --> 01:19:45.776
Tough.

01:19:45.782 --> 01:19:48.650
We're a team, package deal.

01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:51.851
Anybody who doesn't like it
can shove it.

01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:55.857
All right, man, cool.

01:19:55.858 --> 01:19:57.058
Package deal.

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:08.465
Oh...

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.642
I can't zip this thing up.

01:20:11.643 --> 01:20:13.441
Suck it in, girl.

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:15.712
Come on, this dress
is not made for a human being.

01:20:15.713 --> 01:20:17.911
- It's made for a...
- Anorexic mannequin?

01:20:17.914 --> 01:20:19.384
Welcome to the
world of high fashion.

01:20:19.385 --> 01:20:21.422
Now get out there, killer.

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:36.196
Doc, what do you think?

01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:39.269
Is this appropriate enough
for the wedding?

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.635
I...

01:20:41.637 --> 01:20:42.697
Uh...

01:20:42.705 --> 01:20:44.265
Oh, hashtag clue.

01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:47.212
A dress like this has nothing
to do with appropriateness.

01:20:47.213 --> 01:20:50.240
Its sole purpose is to engender
insane jealousy among women.

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:52.476
And hormonal overload
in the men.

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:54.981
Well, the straight ones,
at least.

01:20:54.984 --> 01:20:57.919
All the gay ones' eyeballs will be
all over your boyfriend over here.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.120
Oh, no, he's not my boyfriend.

01:20:59.121 --> 01:21:00.221
I'm not her boyfriend.

01:21:00.223 --> 01:21:02.057
They say rather loudly.

01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:08.059
So, Doc, what do you think?
Is this the one?

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:10.004
Yeah, it's good.

01:21:10.005 --> 01:21:12.167
It's fine.
Write it up, Marie.

01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:14.098
Excellent choice.

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:18.406
What?

01:21:18.407 --> 01:21:20.367
Oh, nothing,
I was just thinking of

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:23.606
the looks on the guys' faces if
I play my game at the wedding.

01:21:24.412 --> 01:21:25.947
Your what?

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:30.118
The tricks that chicks use
to get guys' attention?

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:32.589
Okay. For example...

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:35.088
The hair toss.

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:42.232
The lipstick check.

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.267
Work it, work it.

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:47.736
If you got it, flaunt it.

01:21:47.737 --> 01:21:49.837
I love that movie.

01:21:49.839 --> 01:21:52.009
And last,
but certainly not least,

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:54.784
the stocking check.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:59.182
Oh, my goodness.

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:04.345
Is that a run?
How perfectly awful.

01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:06.221
Yeah.

01:22:06.222 --> 01:22:09.190
Works like a charm every time.

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:11.431
But you gotta have
the gams to back it up.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.460
All right,
let's get this baby in a box

01:22:16.465 --> 01:22:18.665
and get you back in
your street <i>schmates.</i>

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:26.567
Hmm.

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:31.975
Oh, my God.

01:23:16.358 --> 01:23:18.188
Sam, what's going on?

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:22.358
What, are...
Is everything all right?

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:25.195
You're downstairs?
Um...

01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:28.401
Yeah, uh, yeah, just come on up.

01:23:28.404 --> 01:23:30.674
All right, bye.

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:42.752
What am I doing?

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:44.853
He's...

01:23:44.854 --> 01:23:47.724
She is sloppier than I am.

01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:55.729
Come on in.

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:02.037
How's it going?

01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:06.968
Um, yeah, good, good, yeah,
I think, um, probably.

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:10.076
Probably?
What's wrong?

01:24:10.079 --> 01:24:13.479
You know what?
I'm sorry, I, um...

01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:14.982
I'm gonna go. This can... Oh!

01:24:14.984 --> 01:24:17.084
This isn't... This can wait.
Oh, hey.

01:24:17.086 --> 01:24:18.746
Hold on, what's wrong?

01:24:18.754 --> 01:24:21.324
I'm sensing a disturbance
in the Force.

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:24.457
What's going on?

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:29.200
Well, it's, um,
it's about the issue.

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:33.295
The issue?
Yeah.

01:24:33.302 --> 01:24:35.372
Ah, the issue, oh.
Yeah.

01:24:35.373 --> 01:24:37.441
The issue, the...

01:24:37.442 --> 01:24:40.040
You're still having problems
with the arousal thing?

01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:44.212
Oh, God, no, no, actually,
um, it's been fine.

01:24:44.213 --> 01:24:48.450
Uh, how fine, like,
um, you know, once a day?

01:24:48.451 --> 01:24:49.781
More.

01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:53.116
Two, three times a day?

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:57.089
More than three times?
Yeah.

01:24:57.093 --> 01:24:59.060
Per day?
Yeah.

01:24:59.061 --> 01:25:00.591
How much more?
Six.

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.131
Today?

01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:05.700
Tonight.

01:25:05.701 --> 01:25:07.901
You know what, Doc?
I'm so sorry.

01:25:07.903 --> 01:25:10.071
I'm really embarrassed.
I think...

01:25:10.072 --> 01:25:11.272
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go.

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:13.313
Whoa, whoa!
Come on, it's fine.

01:25:13.314 --> 01:25:15.777
What's going on?

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:18.648
I don't know, it's just that,
you know, she's, um...

01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:23.351
She's being
really specific about...

01:25:23.352 --> 01:25:25.820
About, um, who she wants.

01:25:25.821 --> 01:25:27.751
Like, if I, um, if I think of,

01:25:27.756 --> 01:25:30.656
um, this one person,

01:25:30.659 --> 01:25:33.728
she gets, like,
really, really happy.

01:25:33.729 --> 01:25:35.529
And then if I think
about anyone else,

01:25:35.531 --> 01:25:38.299
she gets, like, really cranky.

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.770
So, uh...
Who's the lucky, uh...

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:50.308
No, no!
Fuck, oh, fuck, no!

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:51.780
Yeah, Doc, you know, oh, my God...
No...

01:25:51.781 --> 01:25:53.410
It... Ah! It's so stupid.
I'm so sorry.

01:25:53.415 --> 01:25:54.615
You know what, just forget
that I said anything.

01:25:54.617 --> 01:25:56.077
Oh, no, no.

01:25:56.085 --> 01:25:57.445
Well, you know what,
just wait, hold on.

01:25:57.453 --> 01:26:00.353
Uh, um...

01:26:00.356 --> 01:26:02.856
Listen, I'm the one who
should be apologizing here

01:26:02.858 --> 01:26:06.528
because you come in and then
you are honest with me,

01:26:06.529 --> 01:26:09.159
and what I do is I play
20 questions with you.

01:26:09.165 --> 01:26:11.165
Um, that's not fair 'cause...

01:26:11.167 --> 01:26:13.727
What you're dealing with is...

01:26:13.736 --> 01:26:15.596
You're trying to compact, like,

01:26:15.604 --> 01:26:18.142
30 years of female
psychological development

01:26:18.143 --> 01:26:20.140
into a few really
short months and...

01:26:20.142 --> 01:26:22.842
And, um... I think that
what you're gonna find

01:26:22.845 --> 01:26:26.175
is that, uh, in time
the sexual focus,

01:26:26.182 --> 01:26:29.250
uh, shifts and it expands.

01:26:29.251 --> 01:26:33.621
And that, uh, there are
techniques you can use,

01:26:33.622 --> 01:26:36.422
um, to, uh...

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:39.559
I'm babbling.

01:26:39.562 --> 01:26:41.232
Yeah.

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:45.728
'Cause I'm completely
full of shit.

01:26:47.635 --> 01:26:48.935
Yep.

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:50.971
Sam!

01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:55.109
Buddy.

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:58.210
We... We used to
chase babes together.

01:26:58.214 --> 01:26:59.384
You know, we would...

01:26:59.385 --> 01:27:00.850
We'd get hammered together.

01:27:00.851 --> 01:27:02.879
I can't help it!
She won't listen to me.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.590
Time out.

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:08.256
Okay.

01:27:08.257 --> 01:27:10.257
Time out.
Let's, um...

01:27:10.259 --> 01:27:11.789
Let's breathe.

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.456
Oh, that's good.
Right like that.

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:18.265
We're gonna breathe.

01:27:18.267 --> 01:27:21.897
We had a moment and,
uh, the moment passed.

01:27:22.604 --> 01:27:24.004
And we're fine.

01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:26.636
You're fine!
I'm in heat!

01:27:26.642 --> 01:27:28.610
Sam... Oh, sit, just...

01:27:28.611 --> 01:27:30.281
Why don't you sit?
Why don't, um...

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.949
Eat some chips.

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:37.680
And I'm gonna get,
uh, you a beer.

01:27:37.686 --> 01:27:38.916
We're gonna get a beer,

01:27:38.921 --> 01:27:40.621
and we're gonna talk this out.

01:27:40.623 --> 01:27:42.393
Mmm.

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:48.461
Oh...

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:54.966
Oh.
That's nice.

01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:57.770
You, you know...

01:27:57.773 --> 01:27:59.843
We are gonna look back at this,

01:27:59.844 --> 01:28:01.012
and we're gonna...

01:28:04.213 --> 01:28:09.623
Oh, God, you smell so...

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:12.789
good.

01:28:15.523 --> 01:28:17.458
Um...

01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:20.928
That's... Those
are, uh, it's just androgens.

01:28:20.929 --> 01:28:24.359
Those are pheromones and
it's a chemical...

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:30.997
What?

01:28:32.206 --> 01:28:35.236
I'm getting the
uncontrollable urge to...

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:37.310
Cuddle.

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:40.513
Oh.

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:44.017
Wow.

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:48.418
Mmm.

01:29:07.575 --> 01:29:10.705
Good day, Miss Wellman.

01:29:10.713 --> 01:29:12.651
Well, you know
what they say, Lou.

01:29:12.652 --> 01:29:14.348
Every day above ground's
a good one.

01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:15.850
Ain't that the truth.

01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:24.931
Wow.

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:45.814
"Ye Old Curiosity Shoppe."

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:54.691
"Tonight at midnight,
to make the choice."

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:48.576
Congratulations.

01:30:48.577 --> 01:30:50.877
Oh, thanks, Doc.
Thanks for coming.

01:30:50.879 --> 01:30:53.579
And, uh, you're here.

01:30:53.582 --> 01:30:55.252
It was a beautiful ceremony.

01:30:55.253 --> 01:30:56.750
Thank you.

01:30:56.752 --> 01:30:59.587
So, you're Sam's cousin.

01:30:59.588 --> 01:31:02.488
Same blood runs
through our veins.

01:31:02.491 --> 01:31:03.721
I've heard a lot about you.

01:31:03.725 --> 01:31:05.325
Only good things, right?

01:31:05.327 --> 01:31:07.857
So, uh, how is Sam doing anyway?

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:12.926
Oh, uh, he's like a new person.

01:31:12.935 --> 01:31:15.095
Sort of feels like
he's with us here in spirit.

01:31:16.638 --> 01:31:19.538
Well, uh, we don't want
to hoard all of your time.

01:31:19.541 --> 01:31:21.509
Come on, Sam... Mantha.

01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:22.580
Let's go get a cocktail.

01:31:22.581 --> 01:31:24.008
Enjoy.

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:26.676
Weird.

01:31:26.682 --> 01:31:28.782
Feeling a little bit cocky, eh?

01:31:28.784 --> 01:31:30.952
Sorry, couldn't resist.

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:39.288
Oh. Hi.

01:31:39.294 --> 01:31:41.164
Hi.

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:45.030
Having fun?
Yeah.

01:31:45.033 --> 01:31:47.668
Uh, you know, you're supposed to

01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:49.969
only get married once.

01:31:49.972 --> 01:31:52.507
In theory, anyway.

01:31:52.508 --> 01:31:55.438
Listen, Georgette, I, um...

01:31:55.444 --> 01:31:57.244
I know that you don't like me.

01:31:57.246 --> 01:31:59.346
I don't really know you.

01:31:59.348 --> 01:32:01.778
Um, I...

01:32:01.783 --> 01:32:03.653
You know me better
than you think.

01:32:03.654 --> 01:32:04.919
I do?

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.650
Oh, yeah, you know,
that whole...

01:32:07.890 --> 01:32:09.960
female intuition thing, right?

01:32:09.961 --> 01:32:11.558
Right. Uh...

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.060
Anyway, um...

01:32:14.062 --> 01:32:15.562
I hope I'm not out of line.

01:32:15.564 --> 01:32:17.204
Um, just a thought.

01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:20.573
If you want it
to work out with Stephen,

01:32:20.574 --> 01:32:23.839
I mean, really work out
for the long haul,

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:26.769
just be his friend,

01:32:26.775 --> 01:32:31.205
and everything will fall
into place from there.

01:32:31.846 --> 01:32:33.076
Wow, uh...

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.779
I really didn't
expect that from you.

01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:38.045
Yeah, neither did I.

01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:43.916
Thank you, Samantha.

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:08.649
You know, when I was a guy,
I used to do this for girls.

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:12.153
Oh, who am I kidding?

01:33:12.154 --> 01:33:13.954
I don't think I've ever done
this for a woman.

01:33:13.956 --> 01:33:15.716
You know...

01:33:15.724 --> 01:33:18.734
I think you've grown
your own brand of chivalry.

01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:22.029
Thanks, Doc.

01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:23.700
What's wrong, Sam?

01:33:24.699 --> 01:33:26.029
You seem sad.

01:33:26.034 --> 01:33:28.544
I noticed in the car
on the way over.

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:32.541
Let's just talk
about it later, okay?

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:36.043
You know what?
I think...

01:33:36.044 --> 01:33:38.813
I think they might be
playing our song.

01:33:38.814 --> 01:33:40.781
We have a song?

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:42.422
We do now.

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:44.120
Come on.

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:50.919
May I have this dance?

01:33:50.926 --> 01:33:53.756
Eh, does a bear shit...

01:33:53.762 --> 01:33:54.962
Of course you may.

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:10.343
So, what's it like?

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.680
What's what like?

01:34:14.683 --> 01:34:16.383
Being a woman.

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:21.188
It's, um...

01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:23.189
Tsk. It's, like, uh,

01:34:23.191 --> 01:34:26.861
someone added 27 frequencies
to my radio dial.

01:34:27.628 --> 01:34:29.598
Which means...

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:32.099
Um...

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:34.368
Which means...

01:34:34.369 --> 01:34:35.939
When I walk into a room,

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.797
I pretty much know

01:34:37.806 --> 01:34:39.606
what's going on with everybody,

01:34:39.608 --> 01:34:42.108
whether they're happy or horny

01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:44.910
or sad or...

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:48.152
If they have a chance in hell

01:34:48.153 --> 01:34:49.950
of stealing you away from me.

01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:53.151
Anybody in here, uh...

01:34:53.155 --> 01:34:55.355
Giving you any competition?

01:34:57.858 --> 01:34:59.958
See that blonde over there
by the punch bowl?

01:34:59.961 --> 01:35:01.661
Yeah.

01:35:01.663 --> 01:35:03.733
Well, she'd have a shot at you.

01:35:03.734 --> 01:35:06.402
If she wasn't so busy
checking out that guy's Rolex

01:35:06.403 --> 01:35:09.671
and if...

01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:12.067
Yeah?

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:16.205
If you weren't totally
smitten with me.

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:17.641
Oh.

01:35:17.646 --> 01:35:19.776
I'm smitten, huh?

01:35:20.581 --> 01:35:22.451
Crazy in love.

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:27.249
Wow, you're good.

01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:36.361
Feeling's mutual, by the way.

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:47.141
I know it's you...

01:35:47.142 --> 01:35:48.942
Sam.

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:53.082
But you're different.

01:35:55.616 --> 01:35:56.776
Good different?

01:35:56.785 --> 01:35:58.115
No.

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.190
Not good.

01:36:04.992 --> 01:36:06.232
Amazing.

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:17.339
When's the last
time you kissed me like that?

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:20.839
Tonight.

01:36:20.842 --> 01:36:22.042
Mmm-hmm.

01:36:30.184 --> 01:36:31.424
Wow.

01:36:40.995 --> 01:36:42.425
What?

01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:43.900
What, do you have
a hot date or something?

01:36:43.901 --> 01:36:45.969
Come on, you're spoiling
my afterglow.

01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:49.198
I have to talk to you outside.

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:51.437
Right now.

01:36:58.612 --> 01:37:00.447
I need a favor.

01:37:00.448 --> 01:37:02.716
Anything.

01:37:02.717 --> 01:37:04.147
Can you drive me
down to the Village?

01:37:04.152 --> 01:37:05.786
Now?

01:37:05.787 --> 01:37:07.217
What for?

01:37:07.222 --> 01:37:08.822
Do you trust me?

01:37:08.824 --> 01:37:10.691
Of course, I trust you.

01:37:10.692 --> 01:37:13.162
Well, then, just please
don't ask any questions.

01:37:13.163 --> 01:37:14.829
Okay.

01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:17.230
If that's the way you want it.

01:37:17.232 --> 01:37:19.967
Okay, but we have to
leave right now.

01:37:19.968 --> 01:37:21.398
I need to be there by midnight.

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.800
Doc...

01:37:54.803 --> 01:37:56.270
No.
Sam...

01:37:56.271 --> 01:37:57.541
No.
