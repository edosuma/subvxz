No, go ahead.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.378
Thanks.

10:06.780 --> 10:10.131
Okay. So, it looks like
he grabbed the bike.

Somewhere
around here.

We got your texts.Is Gina okay?

10:41.553 --> 10:44.687
Yeah, but the SUV didn't show up
at any nearby gas stations.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.734
So it's got to be near
the one it was stolen from.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.692
But it didn't show up on
any satellite images either,

10:49.736 --> 10:52.303

it's under cover somewhere.

Hey, could you guys check out

10:53.783 --> 10:55.698

Of course.

Uh, how big of an area
are we talking?

11:01.878 --> 11:03.445
A three-mile radius
of the gas station.

11:03.488 --> 11:06.143
Right, we're on it.
Thank you.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.712

we've got something.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.671
Joseph Giles.

11:12.497 --> 11:14.325
Does he have a record?No.

11:14.369 --> 11:18.329

Uh, hey, you know that SUV

11:30.080 --> 11:31.734
that was reported stolen
this morning?

11:31.778 --> 11:34.215
On average, there are 15 cars
stolen in Hawaii every day.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.217
Believe it or not,
I don't make it a point

11:36.260 --> 11:37.958
to know about every one of them.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.003
Okay, well, the victim hired us
and we've identified the thief.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.265
His name is Joseph Giles.

11:41.309 --> 11:42.484
Joseph Giles?

11:42.527 --> 11:43.920
Yeah. Could you look him up?

11:43.964 --> 11:45.661
Don't need to.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.620
He's part of an open
HPD investigation.What do you mean?

11:48.664 --> 11:49.839
Giles was reported
kidnapped last night.

11:49.883 --> 11:50.840
His neighbor saw

11:50.884 --> 11:51.928
a couple guys grab him

11:51.972 --> 11:53.669
outside their apartment complex.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.758
Well, that makes sense
with the footage that we saw.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.194
He didn't take the SUV

11:57.238 --> 11:58.500
just 'cause he wanted it.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.762
MAGNUM:
No, he must have somehow escaped

11:59.806 --> 12:01.677

to evade his captors.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.419
So it seems like our car thief
is actually a victim on the run.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.167
Just because you figured out
Giles is a victim,

12:13.210 --> 12:14.342
that doesn't make him
your client.

12:14.385 --> 12:15.909
No, I never
said he was.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.345
Our priority is to
find our client's dog,

12:17.388 --> 12:19.782
and the best way to
do that: find Giles.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.479
Like it or not,
our cases are linked.

12:21.523 --> 12:24.265
Assuming Giles reached
Gina's SUV on foot,

12:24.308 --> 12:26.136
the place he escaped from
had to be

12:26.180 --> 12:28.051
within walking distance
of the gas station.

12:28.095 --> 12:30.401
We figure out where that is,
we have a lead.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.490
Problem is there's over
three million square feet

12:32.534 --> 12:34.101
of commercial real estate
in that area.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.494
It'd take us over a week
to canvass that much ground.

12:36.538 --> 12:39.410
We need some way
to narrow it down.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.717
Any idea why somebody
would want to grab Giles?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.764
None. The guy's
a high school anatomy teacher.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.113
The only record on him is

12:46.156 --> 12:47.201
the number of service awards
he's been given.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.290
Perhaps he has a secret life.

12:49.333 --> 12:52.902
Well, if that's the case,
whatever vice he was into

12:52.946 --> 12:54.643
wasn't gambling
or anything expensive.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.036
His financials are clean.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.559
Yeah,
but what's odd is,

12:57.602 --> 13:00.040
if he did escape,
he should have surfaced by now,

13:00.083 --> 13:01.693
or at least called HPD.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.347
He may be laying low.

13:03.391 --> 13:04.696
Or maybe he's been recaptured.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.743
The neighbor who
reported Giles missing--

13:07.787 --> 13:09.658
was he able to identify
the kidnapper?

Yeah. Guy named Lee Sung.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.748
But we haven't found him.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.576
Our biggest lead is
he's a member of Jumak.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.883
Jumak?It's a ruthless
Korean gang.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.885
They're good at operating
off the grid,

I know just the thing
to celebrate.

41:44.023 --> 41:45.720
This, my friends, is
called the M-800.

41:45.764 --> 41:47.461
It is technically
considered dynamite

41:47.505 --> 41:48.767
in 13 states.[others shouting]

41:48.810 --> 41:50.072
Oh! Whoa, whoa. Jin, Jin.

41:50.116 --> 41:51.900
Hand it over.
Give it, give it here.

41:51.944 --> 41:53.206
Let's save this

41:53.249 --> 41:54.555
for when we go mining
in the quarry.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.905
How about a round of beers,
on the house?

41:56.949 --> 41:58.254
HIGGINS:
Oh, hey, uh,

41:58.298 --> 42:00.474
Giles called.
He wanted to apologize to Gina.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.999
And he offered to pay
for Atticus's procedure.

42:04.043 --> 42:05.697
Really? That's great.

42:06.915 --> 42:08.438
Well, how about a toast?

42:08.482 --> 42:09.657
To Giles?

42:09.701 --> 42:11.224
Nah. The lads.

42:12.921 --> 42:14.183
Really?

42:15.271 --> 42:17.360
Even though we're sworn enemies,
uh, companionship

42:17.404 --> 42:19.580
and loyalty go a
long way with me.

42:19.624 --> 42:23.105
Even though sometimes it takes
me a little time to see that.

42:23.149 --> 42:25.281
Huh. To the lads.

42:25.325 --> 42:28.110
ALL:
To the lads.

42:28.154 --> 42:30.765
[laughter]MAGNUM: Cheers.
