our marriage will work.

I even mentioned the test.

it’s your turn.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.665
would you be angry

if Cousin Larry was working late

10:00.734 --> 10:02.936
and he didn’t call you
and therefore

10:02.969 --> 10:05.672
the pig snout that you prepared
for dinner was ruined?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.677
Well, that‐that’s
a difficult question, Balki.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.647
I‐I know how involved
Larry can get with his work

10:13.680 --> 10:15.949
so, I guess I would understand
if he forgot to call me

10:15.982 --> 10:18.284
once or twice
but if it happened all the time

10:18.318 --> 10:20.253
I suppose I would get angry?

10:23.123 --> 10:25.726
Well, go‐good
answer! Good answer!

10:31.331 --> 10:33.233
Isn’t that
a‐a good answer, Balki?

10:33.266 --> 10:34.968
Cousin, as I’ve explained before

10:35.001 --> 10:36.970
there are no good
or bad answers.

10:37.003 --> 10:39.740

and scoring those responses

10:45.278 --> 10:47.180

this test has been

a number of years.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.755
It is not a game and I think
we should remember that.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.459
I don’t believe
I said anything about juggling.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.229
Oh, oh, God, does that mean
I got the part

12:09.262 --> 12:11.231
about standing on, uh,
one foot wrong too?

12:13.534 --> 12:15.268
Sit down, please.
Put the apples away.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.940
Cousin, as I explained before
there is no right and wrong.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.742
Were you not listening?

12:23.510 --> 12:24.811
Larry was listening.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.046
He‐he’s a very good listener.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.181
Uh, he, uh, he should get
extra credit for that.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.917
Fine, the test is finished.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.353
I’ll just, uh,
compute your score.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.621
Oh, God. I hope we passed.

12:34.655 --> 12:37.223
Oh, we... D‐don’t worry.
Don’t worry. I’m sure we did.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.459
Honey, your answers
were, were wonderful.

12:39.492 --> 12:42.529
And, and I did a hundred
and twenty‐five push‐ups.

12:44.330 --> 12:47.033
So, so, Balki, what do we have
to score to be compatible?

12:47.067 --> 12:49.369
‐Sixty.
‐We‐well, so what did we score?

12:49.402 --> 12:51.772
‐Eighty, ninety?
‐Three. Your score is three.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.975
[instrumental music]

13:00.046 --> 13:01.948
[instrumental music]

13:07.087 --> 13:10.891
I skipped rope with a book
on my head and we got a three?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.094
It’s my fault.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.097
I should have been more
enthusiastic about vacuuming.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.503
Jennifer, uh, Cousin Larry

13:22.536 --> 13:26.339
I, uh, I really
feel like babasticki.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.474
I never would have asked you
to take the test

13:28.509 --> 13:30.577
if I thought
you would do so badly.

13:31.512 --> 13:33.046
I sucked a lemon

13:33.079 --> 13:35.481
and whistled "The Battle Hymn
of the Republic..."

13:37.050 --> 13:39.352
...and we get a three?

13:41.888 --> 13:45.391
[stammers]
Well‐well‐well, so what?

13:47.293 --> 13:49.563
I mean, even if
the‐the test means something

13:49.596 --> 13:51.264
and‐and I’m not saying
that it does

13:51.297 --> 13:54.000
uh, B‐Balki probably didn’t even
give the test right.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.402
I beg to back issue with you.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.506
I know how to
administer this test.

13:59.540 --> 14:02.909
I happen to be a licensed
Nupitiki Doctor Ruthiki.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.182
A Nupitiki Doctor Ruthiki?

14:10.684 --> 14:13.386
That’s a Myposian
marriage counselor.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.221
You’re a Myposian
marriage counselor?

14:15.255 --> 14:17.558
‐That is correct.
‐What do you do?

14:17.591 --> 14:20.426
Start with shaky sheep marriages
and work your way up to people?

14:22.362 --> 14:25.566
Sheep don’t have problem
with their marriages.

14:25.599 --> 14:28.602
Pigs, on the other hand, often
have problems with commitment.

14:31.237 --> 14:34.007
That’s why they call them pigs.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.109
Balki, uh, I have to agree
with Larry.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.545
I mean, just because the test
has never been wrong before

14:38.579 --> 14:40.346
doesn’t mean
it can’t be wrong now.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.115
And‐and just because
you’ve given the test before

14:42.148 --> 14:44.250
that doesn’t mean you didn’t
make a mistake this time.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.553
Well, that’s the kind of talk
I, I like to hear.

14:46.587 --> 14:49.289
I mean, so‐so w‐we’ll
still get married.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.024
We‐we‐we’ll take the test again.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.159
We’ll‐we’ll take a year,
two years tops.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.161
We‐we’ll study,
we’ll pass the test

14:55.195 --> 14:57.430
and we’ll get married
two years from June.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.533
Right, Jennifer?

14:59.566 --> 15:02.068
Right, right!

15:02.102 --> 15:03.469
Oh! Oh, uh, Larry.

15:03.504 --> 15:04.705
Uh, I‐I just remembered.

15:04.738 --> 15:08.575
Um, two years from, from, uh,
now is right around the time

15:08.609 --> 15:10.176
my father was going to retire.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.578
See, he and my mother
are gonna buy a Winnebago

15:11.612 --> 15:12.779
and travel across the country.

15:12.813 --> 15:15.081
I‐I think our wedding might
interfere with their plans.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.952
Well, oh, well‐well,
we’ll just start planning

15:18.985 --> 15:20.086
when they get back.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.254
’Uh‐uh‐uh, two years’

15:21.287 --> 15:23.156
uh‐uh‐uh, until his retirement

15:23.189 --> 15:25.091
and say, uh, two years
in a Winnebago

15:25.125 --> 15:27.360
a year of planning,
well, we’re looking at

15:27.393 --> 15:29.563
uh, June, five years from now.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.232
Uh, does that work
for you, Jennifer?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.067
Five years.
I‐I can wait five years.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.602
I mean, after all,
what’s five years

15:35.636 --> 15:37.604
when your marriage
is doomed anyway?

15:39.105 --> 15:41.241
Oh, it’s, it’s gonna be alright.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.945
I think I can help.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.215
How?

15:49.249 --> 15:51.317
Well, it’s a longshot

15:51.351 --> 15:54.120
but I think
your only hope of happiness

15:54.154 --> 15:55.989
is for both of you to take

15:56.022 --> 15:58.291
the Nupitiki
Spic ’n Spanakopita.

16:00.393 --> 16:03.063
The Nupitiki
Spic ’n Spanakopita?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.666
The Myposian
marriage cleansing ritual.

16:07.768 --> 16:10.637
Now i‐i‐it will either
make you compatible

16:10.671 --> 16:13.406
or remove the waxy buildup
from your linoleum.

16:16.242 --> 16:19.145
But either way it’s gonna make
a big difference in your lives.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.648
[instrumental music]

16:27.420 --> 16:29.255
Jennifer, are‐are you sure
you want to go through

16:29.289 --> 16:31.324
with this purification ritual?

16:31.357 --> 16:32.292
We’ve got to, Larry.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.528
We’re not getting anywhere
on our own.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.331
Balki, that’s a very
interesting medallion.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.500
I‐I‐I may be wrong but it...

16:40.534 --> 16:42.503
...looks like it’s in the shape
of a lamb chop.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.139
Well, that’s very observant
of you, Jennifer.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.575
Actually, it’s the shape
of the island of Mypos.

16:48.609 --> 16:52.546
Um, my little village,
Podunki, is right here

16:52.579 --> 16:55.015
in the gristle area and...

16:56.783 --> 16:58.318
...over here in the tenderloin

16:58.351 --> 17:00.120
is Six Flags over Mypos.

17:01.487 --> 17:02.689
Well, the stone
is very beautiful.

17:02.723 --> 17:07.127
Well, the deep color reflects
the turmoil in your relationship

17:07.160 --> 17:09.530
that is preventing you
from having a happy marriage

17:09.563 --> 17:12.298
and if purification takes place

17:12.332 --> 17:14.367
and I’m not making any promises

17:14.400 --> 17:16.435
the color will become lighter

17:16.469 --> 17:18.571
and lighter until it is just

17:18.605 --> 17:21.541
as clear and pure
as your love for each other.

17:24.678 --> 17:27.180
Okay, that’s it.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.849
I am not letting
my future be determined

17:28.882 --> 17:31.752
by some madman
wearing a mood lamb chop.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.524
Larry, I think
we should try the ritual.

17:39.693 --> 17:40.794
Alright.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.229
Then let the purification begin.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.481
[humming]

18:20.166 --> 18:22.268
Oh‐oh. Still blue.
It didn’t work.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.806
I did my best to purify you

18:25.839 --> 18:27.874
but, uh, I’m afraid
your marriage is doomed.

18:27.908 --> 18:29.375
Out of the pool, please.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.178
Out of the pool, please, please.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.280
I’m not even sure you two
should even be friends.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.784
Our marriage is still doomed?

18:37.818 --> 18:41.321
Larry, why did you even
let us try this stupid ritual?

18:41.354 --> 18:44.658
W‐well, you’re the one
who forced us into this.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.527
W‐well, you’re the one
who couldn’t set a date

18:46.560 --> 18:47.694
because you’re so, you’re so...

18:47.728 --> 18:49.796
‐Afraid.
‐Afraid.

18:49.830 --> 18:51.397
Cousin, she just said
you were afraid.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.733
How does that make you feel?

18:52.766 --> 18:54.701
Afraid.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.372
I’m‐I’m afraid that‐that
after we’re married...

18:59.405 --> 19:02.375
...you’ll realize that
I’m‐I’m not the charming

19:02.408 --> 19:04.578
sophisticated man
you thought I was.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.215
And Jennifer?

19:09.249 --> 19:11.552
Well, I’m afraid that
once we’re married

19:11.585 --> 19:15.155
you’ll...find out
I’m not perfect.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.592
Well, I don’t care
if you’re not perfect.

19:19.660 --> 19:21.762
I mean n‐n‐look at you. Uh...

19:21.795 --> 19:24.531
Y‐you’ve never looked
so awful a‐and...

19:26.332 --> 19:29.269
...and I’ve‐I’ve never loved you
so much.

19:31.872 --> 19:32.806
Oh, Larry.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.975
I’ve never seen you
look worse, either.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.343
[instrumental music]

19:37.377 --> 19:40.413
‐I love you too.
‐Well, what about the test?

19:40.446 --> 19:42.248
Well, I‐I don’t care
if the test said

19:42.282 --> 19:44.551
we don’t belong together.

19:44.585 --> 19:46.620
I‐I‐I don’t care
if a‐a million tests

19:46.653 --> 19:49.289
say we don’t belong together.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.591
I want to marry you, Jennifer.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.492
Larry, I want to marry you.

19:52.526 --> 19:53.927
Well, then let’s get married.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.862
Okay, uh, when?

19:55.896 --> 19:57.230
Tonight.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.765
Tonight’s no good.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.901
Oh, God.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.837
No, no, no! I mean, we have to
make, make, uh, arrangements.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.640
How about, uh...September?

20:07.841 --> 20:09.876
Alright, September.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.414
[instrumental music]

20:17.684 --> 20:19.886
There, we’re getting
married this year

20:19.920 --> 20:21.955
and‐and nothing’s gonna stop us.

20:21.988 --> 20:25.358
So, what do you say to that,
Mr. Myposian marriage counselor?

20:25.391 --> 20:27.661
You just passed
the Myposian marriage test

20:27.694 --> 20:28.962
with flying colors.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.366
What?

20:33.399 --> 20:35.368
[laughs]
Cousin...

20:37.571 --> 20:39.472
...everybody fails
the first part.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.674
We make sure of that.

20:40.707 --> 20:44.611
And we make sure that everyone
fails the second part too

20:44.645 --> 20:47.280
and then, and then if the people
still want to be married

20:47.313 --> 20:48.381
to each other then we know that

20:48.414 --> 20:49.950
they have
a really deep commitment

20:49.983 --> 20:52.318
and that they will live
happily ever after.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.492
Well, you‐you mean we would have
failed no matter what we did?

21:00.961 --> 21:03.930
We took mud in the face
for nothing?

21:03.964 --> 21:05.699
No, no, cousin,
it wasn’t for nothing.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.400
I‐it was to prove
to you that you two

21:07.433 --> 21:09.035
have nothing to be afraid of.

21:11.738 --> 21:15.308
Well, Balki, thank you
for helping us see that.

21:16.643 --> 21:19.680
Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

21:19.713 --> 21:23.049
Oh, you know, I‐I‐I guess
I did kind of

21:23.083 --> 21:26.319
do a pretty good job
if I must say so myself.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.457
Well, so, this is what couples
have to go through on Mypos?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.960
Well, uh, to, to, to
some extent. Yeah.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.568
Wha‐what do you mean,
"To some extent?"

21:41.602 --> 21:45.405
Well, we usually make do
with a written test

21:45.438 --> 21:46.940
and some verbal abuse

21:46.973 --> 21:50.410
and a carefully
monitored psychodrama.

21:50.443 --> 21:53.947
But, uh, si‐since no one
on Mypos

21:53.980 --> 21:55.582
is quite as neurotic as you two

21:55.616 --> 21:58.819
I had to kind of put in
some, some special touches.

22:02.589 --> 22:03.990
Special touches?

22:04.024 --> 22:07.060
Well, the, the mud was
kind of my idea, and, uh...

22:15.836 --> 22:17.771
You know, Balki...

22:19.039 --> 22:20.974
...words cannot express

22:21.007 --> 22:23.877
what we feel right now.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.011
Isn’t that right, Jennifer?

22:25.045 --> 22:26.479
Oh, no, they can’t.

22:26.513 --> 22:30.050
Oh, come on, you guys,
I love you!

22:30.083 --> 22:33.754
‐Uh, you don’t owe me anything.
‐Oh, well...

22:33.787 --> 22:36.089
Oh, yes, we do.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.766
Oh, you two!

22:45.799 --> 22:47.768
[instrumental music]

22:55.776 --> 22:58.411
[theme music]

23:14.494 --> 23:15.662
[music continues]
