(SIGHS)

00:24.158 --> 00:26.094
You okay?

00:26.227 --> 00:28.396
I stamped and addressed
all the Save the Date cards.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.231
I hope two months' notice
is enough.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.201
The wedding planning books
all said four to six is best.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.503
You definitely
could have waited
until you had a day off.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.305
I couldn't sleep.

00:38.005 --> 00:38.806
I'm sorry.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.144
I know change
is hard for you.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.881
Salen's changes are not hard
because of my ASD.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.017
The new soap, hand dryers,
and scrubs

00:50.151 --> 00:53.053
are all inferior
to what we had before.

00:53.187 --> 00:56.023
Now I have to bring
my own soap
and paper towels.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.659
I've seen you adapt
to things before.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.662
Like the toilet paper
and how I cut avocados.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.698
She uses the same stuff
at her other hospitals,

01:04.832 --> 01:07.101
and the staff
apparently likes them.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.138
I need to show her
my evidence.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.005
I'm sure Salen
has her own evidence.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.707
She's all about
collecting data.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.176
I'm not wrong.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.044
I didn't say you were.

01:17.178 --> 01:20.248
Maybe you should see
what the others think first.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.450
If the studies
prove I'm right,

01:22.583 --> 01:24.084
what others think
doesn't matter.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.853
To you, yes,

01:25.986 --> 01:28.822
but she installed smile-frown
buttons in every room.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.860
To get Salen
to change her mind,

01:32.993 --> 01:36.029
you need to think about what's
important to her, not you.

01:37.831 --> 01:38.766
That is...

01:40.134 --> 01:41.101
Good advice.

01:41.669 --> 01:42.536
Uh, thank you.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.872
You're welcome.

01:45.005 --> 01:47.408
And thank you
for taking care of these.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.043
I will mail them out today.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.547
This is so exciting.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.550
Yes, it is.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.759
DR. LIM: Well,
you signed a year lease.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.729
Might be worth buying a couch,
putting some art on the wall.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.731
The art I like
I can't afford.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.201
And you didn't like
watching TV in bed?

02:14.735 --> 02:18.239
I definitely liked
not watching TV in bed.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.576
At least get
a damn coffee maker.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.577
Si, Jefa.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.681
Andrews is tu jefe now.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.049
Mmm, suerte la mia.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.586
I know it's been a while
since you've been supervised.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.358
I've got enough on my plate
dealing with Salen,

02:37.491 --> 02:39.159
so please...
Make it work.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.663
I've worked with
trust fund donors
and dictators.

02:43.931 --> 02:44.898
I can manage Andrews.

02:48.369 --> 02:51.171
JORDAN:
** Oh, what
a beautiful morning

02:51.305 --> 02:53.807
** Oh, what a beautiful day

02:53.941 --> 02:55.476
Somebody's
in a good mood.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.611
(CHUCKLES) Just had my first
personal training session

02:57.745 --> 02:59.112
in our new fitness center.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.981
I highly recommend Rafael.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.384
Cute?
Very.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.019
And he knows
just how hard to push
when stretching you out.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.822
I'll stick to
working out at home.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.824
Where he can pretend
he's Rocky Balboa.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.159
More like Soo Woong Lee.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.262
Salen would probably install
a heavy bag if you asked.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.397
She seems eager
to upgrade the amenities.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.433
She's eager for a reduced rate
on our health insurance,
which a gym gives her.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.435
And you prefer
she pay more?

03:21.569 --> 03:23.136
After she's done
with the paint
and window treatments,

03:23.271 --> 03:24.338
the cuts will come.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.806
You're complaining about
upgrades you agree with

03:25.939 --> 03:27.375
because you're
annoyed about cuts

03:27.508 --> 03:28.409
that haven't
even been proposed?

03:29.142 --> 03:30.544
If you're so optimistic,

03:30.678 --> 03:31.645
why were you tossing
and turning all night?

03:33.581 --> 03:34.648
I was hot,
and I hate your mattress.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.217
Don't you have
an ACL to repair?

03:44.858 --> 03:46.660
It was in the low 60s
last night.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.432
(SIGHS) I got tacos
on the way home,

03:51.565 --> 03:52.666
and then I couldn't...

03:54.201 --> 03:56.837
You know,
while we were in bed.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.906
I am still in so much pain
and totally bloated.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.210
Would you fart
in front of a boyfriend?
Absolutely no.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.546
I'm all for being real,
but not that...

04:08.382 --> 04:09.383
Good morning.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.719
We were just saying...

04:11.852 --> 04:13.153
How much we love
the gym. It's...

04:13.287 --> 04:14.355
Stop talking.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.861
(CHUCKLES) I had
an inspiration
in the shower.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.563
I never wait
to jot down a good idea.

04:23.130 --> 04:23.897
All right.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.034
First time I sleep over
at a guy's place,

04:27.167 --> 04:29.036
in the morning,
while he's in the shower,

04:29.169 --> 04:31.705
I go in, take a seat
on the toilet, drop a deuce.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.975
Really separates the men
from the boys.

04:39.947 --> 04:40.948
EMT: We need some help
over here!

04:42.383 --> 04:44.752
27-year-old male.
Severe craniofacial trauma.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.119
Non-responsive.
Breathing's shallow.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.422
ASHER: Need an airway cart
and ICP bolt set-up.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.057
He get hit by a car?

04:50.190 --> 04:51.525
EMT:
His front tire got caught
in a drain grate.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.394
Flew over the handlebars
and crashed face-first
into the curb.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.762
His mouth
is full of blood.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.296
We need to secure his airway
before we lose it.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.947
I need to get a brain
and face CT.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.817
We're also going to need
3-D CT recon scans.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.455
To create a stereolithographic
model of the two...

05:21.589 --> 05:23.557
Actually three surgeries
he'll need

05:23.691 --> 05:25.459
to repair his mandible,
nasal bones, frontal sinus,

05:25.593 --> 05:27.561
and skull and the orbital
blowout fractures.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.763
Damn. That's gonna be awesome.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.601
That we get to help him.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.939
It's also going to be
some very cool surgeries.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.012
COMPUTER: Thank you.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.984
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

05:58.726 --> 05:59.960
Surgery number one
will be a creation of

06:00.093 --> 06:01.629
a submental airway.

06:01.762 --> 06:02.763
The new soap smells awful

06:02.896 --> 06:03.997
and it takes
too long to rinse.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.699
Do you agree?
I like it.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.635
Surgery number two
will be an ORIF

06:07.768 --> 06:09.503
to repair his
nasoorbitoethmoid frontal bone

06:09.637 --> 06:10.971
and sinus fractures.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.206
And the jet air hand dryers
are too loud,

06:13.340 --> 06:15.876
and they aerosolize germs,
increasing their spread.

06:16.009 --> 06:16.977
They're better
for the environment,

06:17.110 --> 06:18.979
and if you've
washed properly,

06:19.112 --> 06:20.313
there shouldn't be
any germs to spread.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.682
Okay, you're wrong.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.717
I'll show you the research
before I talk to Salen.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.786
The third and final surgery
will be ORIF

06:25.919 --> 06:27.555
of the bilateral
mandible fractures, ZMC,

06:27.688 --> 06:28.989
and complex repair
of all orbital fractures

06:29.122 --> 06:31.091
with free tissue transfer,
customized miniplates,

06:31.224 --> 06:32.493
and PEEK implants.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.961
This is gonna
be awesome.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.363
You're gonna talk to Salen
about the hand dryers?

06:36.497 --> 06:38.365
And the soap and scrubs.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.534
Start prepping him
for the submental airway

06:40.668 --> 06:41.835
while I brief Dr. Lim.

06:46.774 --> 06:47.841
There's new soap?

06:53.514 --> 06:56.249
The device was implanted
into my skull two years ago.

06:56.383 --> 06:57.851
And you're still
experiencing the seizures.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.020
No.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.023
For the first time in my life,
I'm able to go on walks alone,

07:03.156 --> 07:06.627
drive a car, actually interact
with clients at work.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.663
Well, if it's working so well,
why does Dr. Karlson
want to take it out?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.398
The company that
made the implant

07:11.532 --> 07:12.566
wants to turn it off.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.704
MATEO: That doesn't
make any sense.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.438
They can't force her
to have it removed.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.640
Yeah, but they can stop

07:19.773 --> 07:21.575
the software updates
it needs to work,

07:21.709 --> 07:23.611
which could make her seizures
even worse.

07:23.744 --> 07:26.213
(SIGHS) The implant's
an experimental prototype.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.281
Worked only for a tiny
percentage of patients,

07:28.415 --> 07:30.651
which makes it not profitable
enough to continue support.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.385
That's absurd.
It's evil.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.888
It's capitalism.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.090
Karlson's right.
It has to come out.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.426
But he's wrong that going back
to the old meds

07:39.560 --> 07:40.961
is her best
treatment option.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.663
What if we swapped
the RNS device

07:42.796 --> 07:44.031
for a vagal nerve
stimulator?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.065
She already had one.
Didn't work.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.936
I was thinking laser
interstitial thermal therapy.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.605
Would only be
partially effective.

07:51.739 --> 07:52.973
She was having
50 seizures a day.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.709
"Partially" can make
a big difference in her life.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.111
Not big enough.
(SIGHS)

07:58.245 --> 08:01.414
What about combining
multiple subpial transections

08:01.549 --> 08:05.519
within the eloquent cortex
with intraoperative ECoG

08:05.653 --> 08:07.621
to resect the adjacent
seizure focus?

08:07.755 --> 08:11.224
That would be complex,
and being even
a few millimeters off target

08:11.358 --> 08:13.293
could leave her
a hemiplegic.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.596
Could happen...
If another surgeon
was doing it.

08:18.231 --> 08:21.301
I'm confident with you at
the helm, we can pull it off.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.306
Trying to "manage up"

08:26.439 --> 08:28.609
is not the way to get an idea
approved by me.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.112
But I'll never
turn down a good idea

08:32.245 --> 08:33.647
because it was
presented poorly.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.184
And it's actually
a great idea.

****

09:09.182 --> 09:10.183
(SIGHS)

09:13.420 --> 09:14.722
I see
you've scheduled a surgery

09:14.855 --> 09:15.856
that has no billing code

09:15.989 --> 09:17.758
because it's never
been done before.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.526
Yes,
the client consented,

09:19.660 --> 09:21.528
and we've already gotten
insurance pre-approval.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.997
Fantastic.
Have you also
run it past legal?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.967
Why would we do that?

09:27.100 --> 09:29.002
Because we could get sued
and it sounds risky.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.739
Is there a Plan B?

09:31.872 --> 09:34.374
There isn't
a comparable option.
Not even remotely?

09:34.507 --> 09:37.577
Well, as is usually the case,
there is a less risky option,

09:37.711 --> 09:39.179
but would also
be less effective.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.915
Seems better
to start with an approach

09:42.049 --> 09:43.717
that leaves us
with less liability.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.989
But as long as it's covered
by insurance...

09:49.589 --> 09:50.658
It's your call.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.094
That was weird.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.696
More like
totally inappropriate.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.030
Hold up.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.566
She's not even a doctor.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.768
She is our boss.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.569
So we're gonna
tell the patient,

10:02.703 --> 10:05.105
"Sorry, that surgery we just
told you about isn't happening

10:05.238 --> 10:06.539
"because we're afraid
you'll sue us"?

10:06.674 --> 10:08.909
No. We're gonna do
exactly as we planned

10:09.042 --> 10:10.811
after we get Salen
on board.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.246
Salen needs to stay
in her lane.
No, you do.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.448
We've got time, right?

10:15.582 --> 10:17.651
There's no harm in you and I
doing a bit more research

10:17.785 --> 10:19.586
while he works on Salen.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.054
Keep me posted.

10:23.891 --> 10:24.958
Great, let me
just finish this up,

10:25.092 --> 10:26.426
and then I can meet you
in 10.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.896
You've got a client scheduled
for three surgeries,

10:29.029 --> 10:31.031
one of which includes
custom prefabricated

10:31.164 --> 10:33.400
polyetheretherketone
implants.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.168
All this for a guy
who fell of his bike?

10:35.302 --> 10:38.205
Actually, better make that 20.
Mmm-hmm.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.307
He didn't fall,
he crashed face-first

10:40.440 --> 10:43.343
into a cement curb
at over 30 miles an hour.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.813
And PEEK implants
are the gold standard

10:45.946 --> 10:46.947
for facial
reconstruction.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.682
Hmm, no doubt.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.851
Problem is, your client's
got Aluminum insurance,

10:50.984 --> 10:54.654
so anything that's not fully
covered we can't offer him.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.357
He can't be transferred.
There's too much brain edema.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.993
And without the PEEK,
he'll have vision deficiencies

11:00.127 --> 11:01.461
and difficulty
eating solid food.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.431
Mmm.
That's unfortunate.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.266
W... (SCOFFS)

11:06.399 --> 11:09.169
I seem to remember
this impassioned speech

11:09.302 --> 11:11.004
about how your struggles
with healthcare

11:11.138 --> 11:12.940
inspired you
to start Ethicure

11:13.073 --> 11:16.176
and how dedicated you were
to improving the system.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.645
For people who make
responsible choices.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.113
He's an adult
with a good job

11:20.247 --> 11:22.682
who thought a $10,000
European road bike

11:22.816 --> 11:24.017
was a better investment

11:24.151 --> 11:25.452
than a premium
health insurance plan.

11:25.585 --> 11:26.987
He was wrong.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.823
And decisions
have consequences.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.125
****

11:39.599 --> 11:40.834
Salen won't let us ...

11:41.735 --> 11:42.970
Can I help you?

11:43.103 --> 11:44.071
Oh, hello.
Where's Nicole?

11:44.204 --> 11:45.305
She's been reassigned.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.507
I'm Ellen,
Aaron's new executive aide.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.443
And he's unavailable
at the moment.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.879
Can I ...
Where is he?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.046
As I said,
he's unavailable.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.314
Can I take a message?

11:54.447 --> 11:55.849
Yes. Salen told Dr. Lim

11:55.983 --> 11:57.650
everything we do needs
to be covered by insurance,

11:57.785 --> 12:00.520
so Dr. Lim told me to prep our
patient for his first surgery

12:00.653 --> 12:04.691
while she ties to get
the polyetheretherketone
implants covered.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.927
Was that two "ethers"?
Is there a space?

12:07.060 --> 12:10.130
Okay, Dr. Glassman
needs to change things back

12:10.263 --> 12:11.164
to the way
they were before.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.601
Okay, I'll make sure
he gets that message.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.169
Good.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.704
And, uh,
what's your name?

12:17.838 --> 12:20.140
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.443
Dr. Glassman will know
if you just say Shaun.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.612
****

12:31.018 --> 12:33.086
You try drinking every meal
for the rest of your life

12:33.220 --> 12:35.055
through a straw.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.258
No, no,
don't put me on hold.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.593
Your day
going any better?

12:40.727 --> 12:43.163
Park and I
just spent two hours
debating the merits

12:43.296 --> 12:45.132
of surgeries neither of us
believes we should do

12:45.265 --> 12:46.566
because I already
came up with

12:46.699 --> 12:48.401
what Andrews thinks
is a "great idea."

12:48.535 --> 12:50.737
But Salen thinks
it's too risky,

12:50.871 --> 12:52.372
and Andrews
won't do anything

12:52.505 --> 12:55.408
without her
unqualified support.

12:55.542 --> 12:59.579
So you're mad
because your boss
likes your idea

12:59.712 --> 13:02.315
and wants to do it
but won't do it right away.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.051
Think maybe
your real problem

13:04.184 --> 13:05.452
is that you're not
used to having a boss?

13:07.988 --> 13:09.589
Could you try not being right
all the time?

13:09.722 --> 13:12.926
****

13:19.933 --> 13:24.404
Your pushback forced me
to think of this differently.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.006
Magnetoencephalography.

13:26.974 --> 13:30.277
Brain scan
before the surgery.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.811
It'll help give us
an accurate picture

13:31.945 --> 13:33.513
of where Jenna's seizures
are starting.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.982
And we may be able to do
the surgery

13:35.115 --> 13:36.583
entirely using
laser ablation,

13:36.716 --> 13:38.385
which would significantly
reduce the risk.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.020
Cool.

13:41.922 --> 13:42.755
Let me know
what you find out.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.394
Marcus.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.462
Thanks for coming
to me.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.331
****

13:59.306 --> 14:01.574
I'm gonna have to go with
"Vitality Puffs."

14:01.708 --> 14:02.575
Mmm.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.812
How's wedding planning
going?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.480
Not bad.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.983
Ugh, tastes like a toenail
dusted with stevia.

14:11.751 --> 14:14.021
And "not bad"
sounds pretty bad.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.490
When I went to mail the
Save the Dates this morning,

14:17.624 --> 14:19.859
I found one
addressed to Shaun's mom,

14:19.993 --> 14:21.861
who he hasn't talked to
since his dad died.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.296
Could be messy.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.632
I want the day to be about
our future, not the past.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.234
I don't want
to reopen old wounds

14:27.367 --> 14:29.236
and, and risk him
melting down

14:29.369 --> 14:30.303
right before
I walk down the aisle.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.473
(GROANS)
I sound so selfish.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.641
I should just send it.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.376
You do sound selfish.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.278
Which is fine.
It's your wedding.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.547
But it's his wedding,
too.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.949
And do you think
he'd hesitate to tell you

14:42.082 --> 14:44.484
if he didn't want
your mom there?
No.

14:44.617 --> 14:48.288
But he's already so stressed
with all the changes here.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.190
You've never handled Shaun
with kid gloves.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.691
No need to start
coddling him now.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.026
Mmm.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.464
Do you fart
in front of Shaun?

14:57.597 --> 15:00.267
Uh, doesn't everyone
stop holding them in

15:00.400 --> 15:02.135
after, like,
the third date?

15:02.269 --> 15:05.738
I like to be seen as sexy.
It keeps the spark alive.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.174
(LAUGHS)

15:07.307 --> 15:09.176
When I first moved in
with Shaun,

15:09.309 --> 15:11.144
I convinced him
to order in atomic wings,

15:11.278 --> 15:13.113
and I got
terrible diarrhea.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.116
But Shaun prescribed
the perfect mixture

15:16.249 --> 15:17.884
of Pepto
and ginger root.

15:18.018 --> 15:21.688
It was disgusting, but I was
also totally vulnerable,

15:21.821 --> 15:23.356
and that can be
a turn-on, too.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.493
Not in the moment.

15:26.626 --> 15:27.694
Long term.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.262
But you think the man

15:29.396 --> 15:31.064
who happily helped you
with your explosive diarrhea

15:31.198 --> 15:32.865
can't handle your opinion
about his estranged mom?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.368
****

15:38.838 --> 15:41.341
So this is
where you're hiding.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.176
It's my home.
It's not a safe house.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.880
Your home that has a phone
you're refusing to answer.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.551
You okay?

15:51.684 --> 15:52.986
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm great.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.555
Always wanted a bit more time
to perfect my dovetails.

15:59.426 --> 16:04.097
I have an issue with
a patient's insurance company.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.199
Could use some
presidential clout.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.900
I have
presidential clout?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.639
Do you even want to know
what the problem is?
(SIGHS)

16:12.772 --> 16:15.642
You want to do everything
you can
for an underinsured patient,

16:15.775 --> 16:17.777
and Salen wants to do
as little as possible

16:17.910 --> 16:19.879
for a client
who can't pay.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.815
(SIGHS) Okay, fine.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.984
I'll call
the insurance company,
but it's not gonna help,

16:25.118 --> 16:29.256
and Salen
will come down on you
like a bat out of a barn.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.824
Since when are you
so defeatist?

16:33.060 --> 16:34.427
Since I was defeated.

Mmm.

16:49.876 --> 16:50.677
Yes.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.985
When I went to mail
the Save the Date cards, I...

16:59.119 --> 17:00.120
It won't work.

17:01.588 --> 17:05.358
There's nothing
as good as the PEEK.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.859
Shaun, could you take a break
for just a minute?

17:06.993 --> 17:09.462

17:09.596 --> 17:11.231

we would each make

17:11.364 --> 17:14.067

Everything is worse.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.737
The dryers are loud
and distracting,

17:17.870 --> 17:19.306
the soap smells terrible,

17:19.439 --> 17:20.973
and I can't properly repair
my patient's face.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.680
Hey.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.048
You're brilliant.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.483
You'll figure it out.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.224
It's time to go stabilize
his airway.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.137
We're gonna
turn off the implant

at your brain

17:51.971 --> 17:53.873
while you're
having a seizure.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.743
It's gonna help us figure out
the safest surgical approach.

turned up, Murphy?

Yes, please.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.932
It's already freezing
in here.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.568
I'm wearing
long underwear

18:21.701 --> 18:23.703
so I won't feel the synthetic
scrubs against my skin.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.905
Placing a stay suture.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.241
And the elastic ankles
ride up my legs.

Careful, don't want
to put too much tension.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.745

the new scrubs

18:32.879 --> 18:34.714
are incredibly
uncomfortable.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.116
ASHER: Maybe a bit,
but they do look better on me.

Oh, I kind of
like them, too.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.054

I think the new scrubs

18:42.189 --> 18:44.491

Oh, yes,
the hand dryers are worse.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.495
I hear they're
shrinking the chapel

18:48.628 --> 18:50.963
to make room
for VIP birthing suites.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.965
Well,
they can invest the profit
in patient care.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.968
Having a place
for families to pray

18:56.102 --> 18:57.870
is an investment
in patient care.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.172
It's not a good one.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.907
Encouraging people
to waste their time

19:01.040 --> 19:03.343
begging some magic man
in the sky for help?

of finite resources.

Silk ties.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.484
What if we didn't need
three surgeries?

19:11.618 --> 19:13.420
What if we could
do it in two?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.355
We could contour mesh
ourselves

19:15.488 --> 19:18.090
and use an SCA flap instead
of a free tissue transfer.

19:18.225 --> 19:21.160
That will let us fix the upper
and midface, orbit,

19:21.294 --> 19:22.595
and mandible
all at the same time.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.498
That would be
a much more risky surgery

19:25.632 --> 19:28.167
and still doesn't get
the PEEK implants covered.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.002
It would save us
almost $90,000.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.171
Which could cover the cost
of the PEEK.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.606
Salen wouldn't
have a problem

19:33.740 --> 19:35.041
if the total cost
remains the same.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.943
Good idea.

We have a client who
needs surgery even
more than we thought

and a boss who was worried
about the risks

20:37.003 --> 20:38.405

do your surgery,

No, I'm not afraid.
