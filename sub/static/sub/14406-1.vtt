00:47.313 --> 00:49.213
Careful, Tucker.

00:49.315 --> 00:53.945
The floor is hot lava. You can't touch
the ground, or you'll burn up.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.818
We gotta get to Craig's room
to get the treasure before we burn up.

00:56.923 --> 01:00.051
- Whas the treasure?
- Craig just got a MichaelJordan rookie card.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.958
It cost him, like, a hundred bucks.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.293
Whoa.

01:05.397 --> 01:08.890
Did you know that in
MichaelJordan's first year with the Bulls...

01:09.002 --> 01:11.903
MichaelJordan had 138 rebounds?

01:12.005 --> 01:14.974
Yeah. But you know who
the Bulls rebound leader is, though?

01:15.075 --> 01:17.305
- Yeah. Scottie Pippen.
- Yeah.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.675
- Where's the card?
- Is in the closet in a shoe box.

01:23.383 --> 01:27.080
He's got the MichaelJordan rookie card
and a Hank Aaron card.

01:27.187 --> 01:30.088
Is not in mint condition,
but is a good card.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.093
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:34.194 --> 01:37.163
- Your brother's got a Playboy.
- No, he doesn't.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.699
- Whas a Playboy?
- A magazine with naked ladies.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.961
What? He doesn't have that.

01:43.069 --> 01:46.368
Look. Dude, I think your brother
can go to jail for this.

01:46.473 --> 01:49.601
Shut up. Don't open it.

01:53.546 --> 01:55.446
Is that what girls look like?

01:55.548 --> 01:57.448
They look so weird.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.450
How do they pee?

01:59.552 --> 02:01.520
It must come out of those.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.384
Gross.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.390
Oh, my God.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.392
Look at that one.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.985
- Tucker, you just stepped
on hot lava. You're on fire.
- Whatever.

02:11.097 --> 02:13.588
#Give me some
of your sweetness, honey #

02:15.401 --> 02:18.427
#Give me some
of that sweet thing now #

02:19.939 --> 02:22.635
Oh, my God.

02:22.742 --> 02:25.233
Look at the ass on that thing.

02:25.345 --> 02:28.542
- Hello.
- What?

02:28.648 --> 02:32.015
You could bounce a quarter off
that sweet turd-cutter.

02:32.118 --> 02:35.554
Tucker, stop it.
Thas Eleanore, our friend.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.555
Her mom's my piano teacher.

02:37.657 --> 02:42.094
Oh, man. I want her to
French-kiss my dick so bad.

02:42.195 --> 02:45.221
Oh, my God.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.265
#Give me some of that
sweetness, honey ##

02:47.367 --> 02:49.426
Look at this.

02:49.536 --> 02:52.937
Jenny's tits are the exact
same size as Miss November's.

02:53.039 --> 02:56.941
- I don't care.
- This means that this is
whatJenny looks like naked.

02:57.043 --> 02:59.603
- Thas amazing.
- That is amazing.

02:59.712 --> 03:01.543
- Hi, Stacy.
- Drop dead.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.843
- Hi, Sheila.
- Eat me, Tucker.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.919
- Set the time and place.
- The two of you can eat shit and die.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.079
Sheila!

03:09.189 --> 03:11.089
Thank you. You know
she's friends with Cindi.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.887
Now she's gonna tell her,
I'm gonna hear all about this. Good job.

03:13.993 --> 03:17.724
Relax. Your girlfrienďs gonna know
it wasn't you. She knows your deal.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.730
Hey, Candace. Looking good.

03:19.832 --> 03:21.766
Heard you went on the pill.

03:25.405 --> 03:29.102
What the fuck did you just say to me?

03:29.209 --> 03:31.268
Nothing. I-I didn't say anything.

03:35.815 --> 03:38.545
Candace, uh, sorry.
I won't go out with you.

03:38.651 --> 03:41.085
I just- I don't dig handicapped chicks.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.020
I have epilepsy, you limp-dicked shit.

03:45.124 --> 03:46.989
I'm not handicapped. Is a condition.

03:47.093 --> 03:51.359
Tucker, if you so much as
make eye contact with me again...

03:51.464 --> 03:53.364
my brother will kill you.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.900
- He's a firefighter, and they're crazy.
- Okay, okay.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.970
Deal. Deal. Deal.

04:02.208 --> 04:05.405
Geez. What a bitch.

04:05.511 --> 04:08.605
- What was that?
- Nothing. I didn't say anything.

04:16.055 --> 04:20.423
Man, why do you even do these sermons?
They don't even pay you.

04:20.526 --> 04:25.327
Tucker, I have told you.
They're not sermons, they're seminars.

04:25.431 --> 04:29.595
I do them because I believe in them, and
I think kids need to hear this message.

04:29.702 --> 04:32.296
I wish my brother
had had a seminar like this.

04:39.178 --> 04:42.909
Shh.

04:43.016 --> 04:47.817
And now I'd like to bring up
Eugene Bell and Cindi Whitehall...

04:47.920 --> 04:53.187
a young couple who will be graduating
from our high school this year.

04:53.293 --> 04:58.162
Les give a nice, warm
Jefferson County Middle School welcome...

04:58.264 --> 05:00.960
to Eugene and Cindi.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.162
Come on!

05:07.807 --> 05:10.002
Hey, gang.

05:10.109 --> 05:14.205
We're here today to talk to you about one of
the most important decisions that you can make.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.579
Now, I know at your age you guys
probably think all the older guys and gals...

05:17.684 --> 05:19.584
are out there having sex.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.586
But Cindi and I...

05:21.688 --> 05:24.316
have been in a relationship
for two and a half years now...

05:24.424 --> 05:27.359
and we've decided to
save ourselves for marriage.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.087
Thas right, Eugene.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.720
We have a happy, healthy romance...

05:31.831 --> 05:34.732
and we don't need intercourse
to prove that.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.735
I'd like to tell you guys
a story right now if I can.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.273
This is a true story that happened to
my older brother, Craig.

05:41.374 --> 05:45.435
Craig was a nice, normal kid,
just like me or you.

05:45.545 --> 05:50.608
Then one night, he and his
girlfriend of two years...

05:50.717 --> 05:53.618
decided to go-
all the way.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.188
It was Craig's first time having sex...

05:56.289 --> 05:59.190
and he thought, hey, whas
the worst thing that could happen?

05:59.292 --> 06:01.658
He thought they were sharing
something very special.

06:01.761 --> 06:04.059
But what she was sharing
with him was syphilis.

06:04.163 --> 06:06.290
He got syphilis.

06:06.399 --> 06:10.392
Then she got pregnant, and
because she smoked cigarettes...

06:10.503 --> 06:12.869
the baby came out a crackhead.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.874
The once-happy couple soon broke up.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.877
Craig had to drop out of high school
and work two jobs so he could keep up with...

06:19.979 --> 06:21.879
the child support payments
and the medical bills.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.779
But it didn't stop there.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.877
One afternoon while my mother was babysitting
for Craig, the baby set the house on fire.

06:28.988 --> 06:31.548
Because he was a crackhead.

06:31.657 --> 06:34.888
My mother and little nephew
died in that blaze...

06:34.994 --> 06:37.895
and the grief from that,
along with the advanced stages of syphilis...

06:37.997 --> 06:40.898
which put an enormous amount
of pressure on Craig's frontal lobe...

06:41.000 --> 06:42.729
drove him insane.

06:42.835 --> 06:45.668
Today Eugene's brother
sits in a padded cell...

06:45.772 --> 06:48.332
doing nothing but eating his own feces-

06:48.441 --> 06:50.500
And regretting the one time...

06:50.610 --> 06:52.805
that he had sex.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.903
Whoa!

06:55.014 --> 06:57.244
Here, buddy.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.318
Lights, please.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.853
This is a venereal disease.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.045
- Hey.
- Hey. I'm in the tree.

07:36.322 --> 07:38.483
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:38.591 --> 07:41.492
- Are your parents asleep?
- Yeah, they just went to bed.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.791
Hey, so Tucker told me about this awesome
party this weekend after the dance.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.797
I think we should totally go.

07:46.899 --> 07:50.528
You want to go to a party
with Tucker after prom?

07:50.636 --> 07:53.571
Yeah. I mean, thas-
thas what people do, right?

07:53.673 --> 07:57.404
Eugene, did you think about
what we talked about?

07:57.510 --> 08:01.002
Uh, yeah, you know, I did think about it.

08:01.113 --> 08:05.015
But, like, I think I need a little bit more time
just to work everything out in my head...

08:05.117 --> 08:07.517
like a month or just a couple of weeks...

08:07.620 --> 08:09.747
'cause there's, like, a lot of factors.

08:09.856 --> 08:13.519
Eugene, I love you. We've been going out
for two and a half years.

08:13.626 --> 08:17.027
- I think we're ready.
- Thas what Sandra said to Craig.

08:17.129 --> 08:20.690
Oh, will you stop talking about
your crazy brother? That was a fluke.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.600
My younger sister has sex all the time,
and neither of her babies are crackheads.

08:24.704 --> 08:27.605
Cindi, I can't believe
what I'm hearing right now.

08:27.707 --> 08:31.404
What about the seminar? What about
everything we said to those kids this afternoon?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.275
I don't think that 15-year-old kids
should be having sex.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.577
You have to wait until you find
that special someone.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.618
But, Eugene, you are my special someone.

08:40.720 --> 08:45.953
And if I'm not yours, then I think that we have
a whole other set of problems to worry about.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.894
I'm gonna go to bed.

08:49.996 --> 08:52.226
I'll call you tomorrow.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.761
Cindi, wait.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.630
I'll have sex with you on prom night.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.538
You promise?

09:04.777 --> 09:07.473
I promise I'll have sex
with you on prom night.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.480
I love you, Eugene.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.743
I love you, Cindi.

09:22.561 --> 09:24.756
- Hello?
- Dude!

09:24.863 --> 09:26.990
Five hours till you're chode deep.

09:27.098 --> 09:28.793
Yes, I know that. Thank you.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.232
Are you psyched? Are you psyched?

09:31.336 --> 09:33.236
Yes, I'm very psyched.

09:33.338 --> 09:35.829
- Did you shave your cock yet?
- What?

09:35.941 --> 09:38.842
You gotta shave your cock.
It makes it look bigger.

09:38.944 --> 09:41.344
Really? Wh- I'm not shaving my cock.

09:41.446 --> 09:45.075
You have to. You gonna have shaved balls
and a hairy cock? Thas gonna look weird.

09:45.183 --> 09:46.844
I'm not shaving my balls either.

09:46.952 --> 09:49.750
- Oh, my God.
- Tucker, I've got this, okay?

09:49.854 --> 09:52.652
Eugene, no, you don't got this.

09:52.757 --> 09:56.693
Look, man, I've already slept with 12 women.
Thas punishable by stoning in some countries.

09:56.795 --> 09:59.320
- Thas great, Tucker.
- That is great.

09:59.431 --> 10:02.923
And I've only been having sex
for two years. Thas six women a year.

10:03.034 --> 10:05.093
Do you know what that means?

10:05.203 --> 10:08.195
That means in 10 years,
I'll have banged, like, 600 chicks.

10:08.306 --> 10:10.831
Did you get the limo? I'm supposed
to pick Cindi up in half an hour.

10:10.942 --> 10:14.378
Horsedick. MPEG's got it.
He's picking you up.

10:14.479 --> 10:18.279
- Who is Horsedick. MPEG?
- Oh, thas Phil, man. Thas his M.C. Name.

10:18.383 --> 10:21.284
- Phil's M.C. Name is Horsedick?
- Dot-MPEG.

10:21.386 --> 10:23.684
Dot-MPEG. That is so ridiculous.

10:23.788 --> 10:26.450
Dude, you are so white.
And whas with this attitude?

10:26.558 --> 10:29.459
This is gonna be the best
night of your life.

10:29.561 --> 10:33.554
Look, I'm not even sure I'm ready to be
doing this. Do you have any helpful advice?

10:33.665 --> 10:37.431
Do you have any tips on how I can make this
a wonderful, romantic night for Cindi...

10:37.535 --> 10:40.163
and everything she wants it to be?

10:40.271 --> 10:42.171
Shave your cock.

10:42.273 --> 10:44.400
Yeah.

10:44.509 --> 10:47.603
Hold on. I think the limo's here.

10:47.712 --> 10:51.170
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

10:51.282 --> 10:55.082
# I'm gon'fuck
a white bitch, I'm gon'fuck a white bitch #

10:55.186 --> 10:58.747
Man, I ain't seen this motherfucker in,
like, four-11 years or some shit.

10:58.857 --> 11:02.759
I didn't know they let people that
dropped out of high school go to prom.

11:05.363 --> 11:08.423
You're stupid! You're stupid!

11:08.533 --> 11:10.694
No, Crystal's still in high school.

11:10.802 --> 11:14.363
I also didn't know
they let freshmen go to prom.

11:14.472 --> 11:17.532
Well, they're gonna let us in there
when Horsedick. MPEG rolls up.

11:17.642 --> 11:20.543
I'm about to sign me a record deal.

11:20.645 --> 11:23.409
Horsedick's got a song on the Internet!

11:24.516 --> 11:26.848
The Internet. Wow.

11:26.951 --> 11:29.784
You know how many motherfuckers
use the Internet?

11:29.888 --> 11:32.220
I know a lot do.

11:32.323 --> 11:36.020
Half of them! I'm talkin' 'bout thousands
and thousands of motherfuckers, man.

11:36.127 --> 11:40.723
And now my shit is up there.
Whoo. We celebratin;

11:40.832 --> 11:42.595
Um, hey, Horsedick?

11:42.701 --> 11:45.602
- Dot-MPEG!
- Dot-MPEG.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.604
Sorry.

11:47.706 --> 11:51.107
Would you mind turning the music down just
a bit? We're almost to my girlfrienďs house.

11:51.209 --> 11:53.769
You can't turn Horsedick. MPEG down.

11:53.878 --> 11:56.608
This is my shit. I made this.

11:56.715 --> 11:59.115
- I made this.
- # I'm gon'fuck a white bitch #

11:59.217 --> 12:01.651
- # I'm gon'fuck a white bitch #
- # I made this shit #

12:02.487 --> 12:05.945
This is my shit!

12:12.163 --> 12:15.394
# I'm gon' fuck a white bitch
I'm gon' fuck a white bitch #

12:23.475 --> 12:26.069
Hi, Cindi. Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Whitehall.

12:26.177 --> 12:28.077
Hi.

12:28.179 --> 12:30.511
Thas some ride
you've got there, Eugene.

12:30.615 --> 12:34.073
Thank you.

12:34.185 --> 12:37.279
- So, there won't be any drinking
going on tonight, will there?
- Dad.

12:37.388 --> 12:39.219
No, sir. Not at all.

12:39.324 --> 12:43.055
Let me get a picture of the two of you.

12:45.864 --> 12:49.300
Oh, Horsedick, you are nasty!

12:52.137 --> 12:54.537
Hey, Daddy.

12:54.639 --> 12:57.904
Come on, get in the car, baby.

12:59.277 --> 13:01.609
Come here, motherfucker.

13:05.216 --> 13:07.343
- Yeah!
- Spank it!

13:18.096 --> 13:21.554
Whoo!

13:38.183 --> 13:40.083
I'm sorry.

13:40.185 --> 13:44.212
I'm sure this is not as romantic
as you probably envisioned the prom.

13:44.322 --> 13:46.222
Hey, everybody!

13:46.324 --> 13:48.986
Denise is so wasted,
she's blowing Brian in the den.

13:52.011 --> 13:55.708
- I'm gonna go get the keys
to the master bedroom.
- Okay.

13:55.815 --> 13:58.340
Aaah!
Okay!

13:58.451 --> 14:00.783
- Meet me upstairs in five minutes?
- Sure.

14:01.921 --> 14:03.718
Sure.

14:08.961 --> 14:11.122
Dude! Where's Cindi?

14:11.230 --> 14:14.393
- Shouldn't you be banging her out by now?
- I'm about to bang her out.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.833
- She just went upstairs.
- Yet you look like you're going to a funeral.

14:17.937 --> 14:20.599
Tucker, I'm just
dealing with this in my own way.

14:20.706 --> 14:23.607
"Dealing with this"?
You're not going upstairs to have surgery.

14:23.709 --> 14:26.906
You're going upstairs
to have sex! With a girl!

14:27.013 --> 14:31.882
And yeah, she may not be the most attractive
girl in school, but she's a solid, solid seven.

14:31.984 --> 14:34.043
What? She's a seven?

14:34.153 --> 14:36.587
Look, you've already decided to do this.

14:36.689 --> 14:40.090
So you can go and trudge through it like
is a chore and end up hurting her feelings...

14:40.192 --> 14:43.491
or you can go enjoy yourself and have sex.

14:43.596 --> 14:45.496
I know, I know.

14:45.598 --> 14:49.329
Look, most guys end up losing their virginity
to some sort of stripper or one-night stand.

14:49.435 --> 14:53.462
You're lucky enough to have it be with a
girl that you actually love, and loves you back.

14:53.573 --> 14:56.474
You're right. You're right.

14:56.576 --> 14:59.977
And that means she may let you do anal.

15:00.079 --> 15:03.480
Thank you, Tucker. That was actually-
That was oddly helpful.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.483
All right. I'm gonna do it.

15:05.585 --> 15:07.485
- I'm gonna do it.
- Yeah!

15:07.587 --> 15:09.487
- I'm gonna do it now.
- All right!

15:09.589 --> 15:11.489
- I'm gonna have sex.
- Yes, you are.

15:11.591 --> 15:15.118
- Oh, my God, I'm nervous.
- That, too, I can help you out with.

15:18.598 --> 15:22.034
- A little whiskey always calms the nerves.
- Cheers!

15:22.134 --> 15:25.035
You should probably have one more
since this is your first time...

15:25.137 --> 15:28.038
'cause you'll explode
as soon as you get it in there.

15:28.140 --> 15:31.041
- Gotta numb the senses.
- Really? That makes sense.

15:33.980 --> 15:36.471
- Whoo!
- I am gonna do it.

15:36.582 --> 15:39.312
Go for it, Eugene.
But one more for good luck.

15:39.418 --> 15:43.548
Yeah. Good luck to me for having sex!

15:46.926 --> 15:50.987
The next time you see me, I will be a man.

15:51.097 --> 15:54.498
Go get 'em, Eugene-Wait!
Thas not the hallway!

15:57.970 --> 15:59.699
Eugene!

16:05.511 --> 16:08.605
Whoa. Punked.

16:26.198 --> 16:29.599
Okay, buddy, nowjust hold still.

16:29.702 --> 16:32.262
I have an idea.

16:32.371 --> 16:34.134
And... wake up.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.107
I knew it! I knew it would work.

16:37.209 --> 16:41.270
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
- You're alive. Whoa!

16:41.380 --> 16:44.872
What the fuck is going on?

16:44.984 --> 16:47.885
- You probably can't move yet. You have atrophy.
- Why can't I move?

16:47.987 --> 16:50.080
Why can't I move and hurt you?

16:50.189 --> 16:53.454
Because you haven't used your body in,
like, four years. You gotta take it easy.

16:53.559 --> 16:56.494
Tucker, whas happening? Why am I here?

16:56.595 --> 16:59.496
You fell down the stairs after prom
and were in a coma for four years.

16:59.598 --> 17:02.499
Then I saved your life,
because I'm a genius.

17:02.601 --> 17:06.002
You! I told you no hit mister with the bat.

17:06.105 --> 17:08.630
Juanita, I brought him back to life.

17:08.741 --> 17:12.301
- I told you the bat trick would work.
- Policía. Policía.

17:12.411 --> 17:15.243
- What the fuck is going on?
- Eugene, don't do that. You'll overexert yourself.

17:19.050 --> 17:21.611
Oh! You're pooping!

17:27.675 --> 17:30.576
Your body is in
an extreme state of atrophy...

17:30.678 --> 17:35.308
but you're in surprisingly good shape for
someone who's been in a coma for four years.

17:35.416 --> 17:38.317
You've healed from all the damage
you received in your initial fall...

17:38.419 --> 17:41.752
so all that you'll need to recover from
is from the effects of the coma itself.

17:41.856 --> 17:45.121
What about my face?

17:45.226 --> 17:48.127
Yes, well, your nose was broken
by the force of the baseball bat...

17:48.229 --> 17:51.687
and the frontal palate of your skull has
some pretty bad fractures.

17:51.799 --> 17:53.426
But we've set most of that.

17:53.534 --> 17:56.298
You were hit pretty hard though.

17:58.372 --> 18:00.533
But you'll find over time...

18:00.641 --> 18:03.906
that your muscle strength will return,
as well as bowel control.

18:04.011 --> 18:07.640
- Until then, is best
to avoid strenuous situations.

18:07.748 --> 18:09.409
Thas why you pooped.

18:09.517 --> 18:12.042
Yeah.

18:12.153 --> 18:15.122
Yeah, you did. A lot.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.515
Lots of poop.

18:18.626 --> 18:20.526
Like, almost four years worth of poop.

18:22.363 --> 18:24.593
Should call you Poopy Pants.

18:24.698 --> 18:26.598
Mr. Poopy Pants.

18:28.769 --> 18:32.330
Sorry. Anyway, I'll let you get some rest.

18:32.440 --> 18:36.206
I'm sure you and your friend
have some catching up to do.

18:38.145 --> 18:42.047
- Oh, and, Tucker, off the record-
- Yeah?

18:42.149 --> 18:44.174
I like your style.

18:48.088 --> 18:50.556
# Fuck me a white-#

18:50.658 --> 18:53.218
I can't believe
I've been here for four years.

18:53.327 --> 18:56.558
Yeah. You gotta watch
where you're walking.

18:56.664 --> 18:59.292
It doesn't feel like four years ago.

18:59.400 --> 19:02.460
I feel like just five seconds ago
I was getting wasted with you...

19:02.570 --> 19:06.006
and going upstairs to have sex.

19:06.106 --> 19:09.007
Wait a minute. How come
just you're here? Where's Cindi?

19:09.109 --> 19:12.806
- Where's my Dad?
- Oh, his job moved him down to Florida.

19:12.913 --> 19:15.643
What? He left me in the hospital?

19:15.749 --> 19:17.478
Well, dude, you were a vegetable.

19:17.585 --> 19:19.610
Besides, he still has an apartment here.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.280
- What about Cindi?
- Oh, I don't know where she is.

19:22.389 --> 19:27.122
- Well, give me your cell phone.
- No, I don't know where she is.
She moved after graduation.

19:27.228 --> 19:29.696
- She left me too?
- You were a vegetable.

19:29.797 --> 19:31.628
Then how come you're still here?

19:31.732 --> 19:33.495
'Cause we're homeys, dude. Lock it up.

19:33.601 --> 19:35.592
I can't believe she would
just leave me like that.

19:35.703 --> 19:38.103
She was around for a little while...

19:38.205 --> 19:41.971
but then she got into college and it really
didn't look like you were gonna wake up.

19:42.076 --> 19:44.977
I mean, it took me four years
to figure out the bat trick.

19:45.079 --> 19:47.809
I tried to look her up
about a year or so ago...

19:47.915 --> 19:52.215
but she dropped out after freshman year,
and the trail goes cold.

19:53.854 --> 19:56.880
Tucker, I appreciate you
being here. L- I really do.

19:56.991 --> 19:59.892
But I think right now
I just need to be alone for a while.

19:59.994 --> 20:01.894
Okay, man.

20:01.996 --> 20:03.896
I'll check on you tomorrow.

20:03.998 --> 20:06.398
Besides, I got a date with the old lady.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.060
Wait. You have a girlfriend?

20:09.169 --> 20:11.069
Well, I'm not the kind of guy...

20:11.171 --> 20:13.071
that gets chained down to one woman...

20:13.173 --> 20:15.471
but lately I've been banging Candace.

20:15.576 --> 20:17.476
That crazy handicapped chick?

20:17.578 --> 20:19.978
Hey. Epilepsy, dude. Is a condition.

20:20.080 --> 20:23.140
Plus, is kind of hot.
She, like, vibrates.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.649
Nice.

20:26.421 --> 20:28.548
All right.

20:28.655 --> 20:31.647
Okay, looking good. Looking good.

20:31.758 --> 20:34.454
Bobby, you wanna sit up
real straight for me there?

20:34.561 --> 20:36.995
- Sit up straight, sweetie.
- All right.

20:37.097 --> 20:40.589
Everybody say, "Fuzzy pickles."

20:40.701 --> 20:42.896
Fuzzy pickles.

20:43.003 --> 20:44.903
That was great. That was great.

20:45.005 --> 20:50.500
I'm gonna try one more, and let me
work with Mommy for a second.

20:50.611 --> 20:52.272
All right, les see.

20:52.379 --> 20:56.281
Les brush some of this hair away
from Mommy's neck-

20:56.383 --> 20:58.283
Bring out Mommy's pretty neck.

20:58.385 --> 21:01.081
Thas good. Thas good. Okay.

21:01.188 --> 21:04.783
Les have a couple wisps
hang down here by the nape of the neck.

21:04.892 --> 21:07.190
Thas good. That looks great. There we go.

21:07.294 --> 21:11.856
And here, position three-quarters
there like that. Okay? Like that.

21:11.965 --> 21:13.933
Thas good. Thas good.

21:14.034 --> 21:16.696
- Like that, and-
- Okay, okay.

21:16.803 --> 21:20.000
- Okay, thas enough playful, pal.
- Is gonna be good.

21:20.107 --> 21:22.507
All right, stay like that.

21:22.609 --> 21:26.511
Is gonna be good. Okay, now
everybody say, "Mommy's a vision."

21:26.613 --> 21:29.377
Mommy's a vision.

21:30.517 --> 21:33.418
Do not run away.
Hey, this is big-time stuff.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.420
Mr. Biederman is extremely upset.

21:35.522 --> 21:39.151
He brings his family in for a photo
and you turn that into soft-core pornography.

21:39.259 --> 21:41.159
He's crazy. I think he does drugs.

21:41.261 --> 21:44.162
Well, he said that you unbuttoned
his wife's shirt.

21:44.264 --> 21:47.165
He said you handed her
your phone number as she was leaving.

21:47.267 --> 21:49.667
- What the "H", bro? Come on!
- Some mail came for you.

21:49.770 --> 21:51.670
Sweet. New Playboy.

21:51.772 --> 21:54.673
How many times have I told you not to
have that delivered here? About a million?

21:54.775 --> 21:57.676
Why doesn't anybody
listen to me, ever? Jesus!

21:57.778 --> 21:59.541
Oh, my God.

21:59.646 --> 22:01.477
What?

22:01.582 --> 22:03.573
Pack your bags, Eugene. I found her.

22:03.684 --> 22:06.585
- No, no, no. You cannot be here.
- Juanita, vámonos.

22:06.687 --> 22:08.780
- I found Cindi.
- What? Where?

22:08.889 --> 22:11.289
Right there.

22:13.860 --> 22:16.090
Mierda.

22:17.764 --> 22:19.994
I can't believe Cindi would do this.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.500
She's changed, man. She's all growed up.

22:22.603 --> 22:24.901
The girl next door is now
one of The Girls Next Door.

22:25.005 --> 22:28.702
Oh, my God. It says one ofher likes
is sex on the beach.

22:28.809 --> 22:31.073
Calm down. That could just be the drink.

22:31.178 --> 22:34.341
Tucker, do you think
that Cindi's still a virgin?

22:34.448 --> 22:36.348
Les see.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.920
No, afraid not.

22:42.022 --> 22:44.217
- Oh, my God.
- This is perfect.

22:44.324 --> 22:46.224
How is this perfect?

22:46.326 --> 22:49.727
This Saturday is Playboy's
annual anniversary bash.

22:49.830 --> 22:51.730
So?

22:51.832 --> 22:54.733
So, this Saturday
all the Playmates, including Cindi...

22:54.835 --> 22:56.735
are gonna be at the Playboy Mansion...

22:56.837 --> 22:59.897
mingling with guests,
sipping slightly alcoholic beverages.

23:01.141 --> 23:03.132
- Yeah, but, Tucker-
- Dude, this is meant to be.

23:03.243 --> 23:05.768
What are the odds that this issue would
come out right now...

23:05.879 --> 23:07.779
as you're getting out of your coma?

23:07.881 --> 23:09.781
I guess.

23:09.883 --> 23:12.784
This is true love speaking. True love doesn't
speak often, but is speaking to us now.

23:12.886 --> 23:15.411
Is telling us to go
to the Playboy Mansion.

23:15.522 --> 23:17.786
Yeah, but, Tucker,
I can't even walk here, man.

23:17.891 --> 23:20.826
- You're getting a little better every day, right?
- Yeah.

23:20.927 --> 23:24.294
So the party's Saturday night. That means
we have to catch a plane Saturday morning.

23:24.398 --> 23:27.959
Is Thursday today, so that gives us
three days to get you on your feet.

23:28.068 --> 23:30.229
Think you can do it?

23:30.337 --> 23:32.305
- I can try.
- Yes! Thas the spirit!

23:32.406 --> 23:34.397
We're going to the Playboy Mansion!

23:34.508 --> 23:37.500
- Yeah! Playboy.
- Ow!

24:17.684 --> 24:20.983
Mister, you have a telephone call from a Mr. Bell.

24:23.390 --> 24:25.517
- Dad?
- Eugene?

24:25.625 --> 24:27.752
- Hey, sport.
- Hey, Dad.

24:27.861 --> 24:31.763
I can't tell you how glad I was when
they told me you came out of that coma.

24:31.865 --> 24:35.062
- Thas great. Thas really great.
- Yeah.

24:35.168 --> 24:37.728
Um, is been weird here.

24:37.838 --> 24:41.330
This actually works out great, 'cause I'm
gonna be up there in a few weeks on business.

24:41.441 --> 24:43.466
In a few weeks?

24:43.577 --> 24:45.807
Thas right, buddy.

24:45.912 --> 24:48.813
Oh, wait a minute.
I'm getting another call.

24:48.915 --> 24:51.816
- You know what? Is Japan.
I'm gonna have to take this.
- Okay.

24:51.918 --> 24:54.113
Okay, but in a few weeks-

24:54.221 --> 24:56.212
What?

24:56.323 --> 24:59.224
Oh, shit. Is this still Eugene? Hold on.

25:10.537 --> 25:12.334
Whoa.

25:12.439 --> 25:17.570
Wow. This is the nicest place
you've ever taken me to, Tucker.

25:17.677 --> 25:20.202
Yeah. They don't even have a drive-through.

25:20.313 --> 25:22.110
Sir, may I help you?

25:22.215 --> 25:26.117
Yeah, we'll take a plate
ofTater-Tots and... Jäger?

25:26.219 --> 25:29.518
- TwoJägers.
- Excellent choice, sir.

25:29.623 --> 25:33.423
- Wanna get your picture taken with the waiter?
- Could I?

25:37.063 --> 25:39.054
Come on, closer.

25:39.166 --> 25:41.691
And-

25:41.802 --> 25:44.566
- Awesome.
- Very good.

25:46.306 --> 25:49.537
So, Tucker, I got you
an anniversary present.

25:49.643 --> 25:52.134
I know. I'm sorry.

25:52.245 --> 25:55.737
I know how you feel about that term,
but it was 13 months ago tonight that-

25:55.849 --> 25:59.012
That we did each other for the first time.

25:59.119 --> 26:02.646
Yes, that we did each other
for the first time.

26:02.756 --> 26:05.919
This is just a little something
to say that is been a great 13 months.

26:06.026 --> 26:09.792
- Thank you.
- Cool! A card.

26:12.265 --> 26:14.233
Is there a check?

26:14.334 --> 26:17.997
No, there's no check.
Is an anniversary card.

26:22.943 --> 26:25.241
You got me the Black Billiard.

26:25.345 --> 26:28.178
This is just like the pipe
that Hugh Hefner used to smoke.

26:28.281 --> 26:30.408
I know.

26:33.920 --> 26:37.515
Candace, you're, like,
so totally the coolest girl in the world.

26:38.625 --> 26:40.490
So, where are we going after this?

26:40.594 --> 26:43.495
Don't you worry about it, babe.
I got it all planned out.

26:43.597 --> 26:45.462
Tonight is gonna be awesome.

26:53.807 --> 26:56.275
What was that? Who is that?

26:57.444 --> 27:00.641
What the fuck?

27:00.747 --> 27:03.307
- Tucker?
- We gotta go, man. Get your stuff.

27:03.416 --> 27:06.510
- What are you talking about? Whas going on?
- We gotta go. Now, now, now.

27:06.620 --> 27:08.520
- We're not leaving till Saturday.
- Plans change.

27:08.622 --> 27:10.453
I'm not ready!

27:12.425 --> 27:15.292
No. No! You can't be here! He's stealing the mister!

27:15.395 --> 27:17.295
Tucker, what the fuck is going on?

27:17.397 --> 27:20.127
We have to get out of town.
I'll explain in the car.

27:20.233 --> 27:22.724
- Get out of town?
- There he is! That son of a bitch!

27:22.836 --> 27:25.202
- Detour, Eugene.
- Let me at him.

27:26.406 --> 27:30.172
You're a dead man,
Tucker Cleigh! A dead man!

27:30.277 --> 27:32.745
- Mister!
- Tucker, what the hell is happening?

27:32.846 --> 27:35.906
Ah! Jesus! Oww!

27:36.016 --> 27:38.678
- There's a ramp right there!
- No time for the ramp.

27:38.785 --> 27:40.685
Hey, hey, take it easy. Hey!

27:40.787 --> 27:42.687
Oww!

27:42.789 --> 27:44.689
Tucker, I can't even walk here.

27:44.791 --> 27:47.692
If I take a shit in your car,
is gonna be a pretty short trip.

27:49.529 --> 27:51.497
Stop! You can't take the mister!

27:51.598 --> 27:54.123
Policla! He's not ready.

27:54.234 --> 27:58.762
- Good-bye, Juanita.
I'll bring him back in one piece.

28:05.445 --> 28:07.811
Pendejo.

28:13.520 --> 28:16.421
Okay, Tucker, what is going on?
Whas wrong with your balls?

28:16.523 --> 28:19.754
- I got to get rid of this cell phone.
They can track it.
- What are you talking about?

28:19.859 --> 28:22.259
Whas going on? Slow down
and tell me what happened.

28:22.362 --> 28:24.922
- I had a problem with Candace.
- Obviously.

28:25.031 --> 28:26.862
What kind of problem?

28:26.967 --> 28:28.867
Well, it was the 13-month anniversary...

28:28.969 --> 28:31.096
of when Candace and I
first started boning.

28:31.204 --> 28:34.139
- Okay.
- So I wanted to do something
really nice and special.

28:34.240 --> 28:38.643
So we got tanked at this really nice
restaurant and then ditched out on the check.

28:38.745 --> 28:42.738
Then we poured some Maker's into a 3-liter of
Coke and did donuts in the Wendy's parking lot.

28:42.849 --> 28:44.749
It was pretty sweet.

28:44.851 --> 28:48.446
Everything was going great.
Then I went to give her her present.

28:48.555 --> 28:51.456
Come into the living room.
I got you something.

28:51.558 --> 28:54.026
Oh, Tucker, thas so sweet.

28:54.127 --> 28:57.096
- What is it? What is it?
- Ta-da!

28:57.197 --> 28:59.131
Apole?

28:59.232 --> 29:01.132
A stripper pole.

29:01.234 --> 29:03.134
A stripper pole?

29:03.236 --> 29:05.534
Happy 13 months boning.

29:05.638 --> 29:07.970
- Tucker.
- Come on, go do a dance.

29:08.074 --> 29:10.804
Do a sexy strip dance or something.

29:12.679 --> 29:14.579
I don't know.

29:14.681 --> 29:16.581
Miss January of this year...

29:16.683 --> 29:19.584
said that 90% of the reason
that relationships fall apart...

29:19.686 --> 29:22.086
is because people don't
spice up the bedroom.

29:22.188 --> 29:24.452
- We're in the living room.
- I know.

29:28.828 --> 29:31.592
Huh? Come on, give it a spin.

29:33.199 --> 29:36.100
Come on.

29:36.202 --> 29:38.762
Yeah, there you go.

29:55.922 --> 29:58.982
#I love myself
I want you to love me #

29:59.092 --> 30:03.153
- # When I'm feelin'down I want you above me #
- Yeah, go on.

30:03.263 --> 30:06.391
#I search myself
I want you to find me #

30:06.499 --> 30:11.994
#I forget myself
I want you to remind me #

30:12.105 --> 30:15.131
Go on.

30:15.241 --> 30:18.233
So anyway, then she kind of
started to get into it.

30:18.344 --> 30:20.073
#Anybody else #

30:20.180 --> 30:24.207
#When I think about you
I touch myself, ohh-ohh-oh #

30:24.317 --> 30:27.184
You look so awesome right now!

30:27.287 --> 30:30.518
Then she started to, like, really
get into it. Man, it was awesome.

30:30.623 --> 30:34.753
She was whipping her hair around,
sticking her butt up in the air.

30:46.372 --> 30:48.567
Okay.

30:48.675 --> 30:51.644
Then she started to go downtown,
if you know what I mean.

30:53.213 --> 30:55.181
Yeah, I know what you mean.

31:01.354 --> 31:04.016
Oh, that feels good.

31:04.124 --> 31:06.524
Oh, thas great.

31:06.626 --> 31:08.560
Oh, thas awesome.

31:08.661 --> 31:11.687
Man, it was great.
Perfect form, lots of tongue.

31:11.798 --> 31:14.596
Hey, check it out. Strobe lights.

31:17.804 --> 31:22.400
You're biting! You're biting! Candace?
You're biting, Candace!

31:22.509 --> 31:26.206
You're biting! Candace!
You're biting me! Candace!

31:26.312 --> 31:28.610
I don't know.
Candace must just hate strobe lights.

31:28.715 --> 31:30.808
Tucker, that was probably the epilepsy.

31:30.917 --> 31:31.975
Don't make jokes, man.

31:33.485 --> 31:38.548
I didn't know what to do, so I panicked
and I grabbed a fork off the counter...

31:38.656 --> 31:41.147
and I stabbed her in the face!

31:41.259 --> 31:42.692
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

31:42.794 --> 31:44.694
I didn't know what to do. I panicked.

31:44.796 --> 31:48.527
- So you stabbed her?
- I thought she was gonna bite my dick clear off.

31:48.633 --> 31:50.897
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

31:51.002 --> 31:53.232
No wonder she looked so pissed off.

31:53.338 --> 31:56.739
Okay, thas terrible, but why
do we have to get out of town like this?

31:59.411 --> 32:03.177
- Oh, no! Her brother!
- You're gonna die tonight, Tucker Cleigh.

32:03.281 --> 32:05.374
Her brother's a fireman.

32:05.483 --> 32:07.883
Have you ever met one of them?
They're crazy.

32:11.790 --> 32:14.418
- They must have put an A.P.B. Out on my plates.
- What?

32:30.308 --> 32:32.776
Roll up your window! Roll up your window!

32:43.154 --> 32:46.055
Whas he gonna do now?

32:49.794 --> 32:52.024
Tucker, do something!

33:07.194 --> 33:09.059
Stupid firemen.

33:09.162 --> 33:11.824
- Can't turn their trucks around.
- My God.

33:24.944 --> 33:28.778
Okay, Tucker, have you put
any thought into this at all?

33:28.881 --> 33:32.476
The Playboy Mansion is on the other side
of the country. Thas a long way to drive.

33:32.585 --> 33:35.110
Well, the country is,
like, 10 states wide.

33:35.221 --> 33:38.281
Each state is roughly a hundred miles across,
so thas like a thousand miles.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.291
We're moving at 60 miles an hour.

33:40.393 --> 33:43.851
We should be there in, like, 600 minutes.

33:43.963 --> 33:46.864
Okay, well, not one part of that
was correct, so let me ask you this.

33:46.966 --> 33:49.867
Have you thought about how we're gonna
get into the mansion once we arrive?

33:51.971 --> 33:54.735
- # I'm-a love a white girl
I'm-a love a white girl #

33:54.841 --> 33:57.435
Wait a minute. Is this Horsedick?

33:57.543 --> 34:00.273
- Dot-MPEG.
- Dot-MPEG.

34:00.380 --> 34:04.282
- Did he change his lyrics?
- Yeah, this is the radio-friendly version.

34:04.384 --> 34:06.284
Wait a minute. Horsedick's on the radio?

34:06.386 --> 34:09.446
Yeah, man. He blew up.
He's like the biggest star on the planet.

34:09.554 --> 34:12.353
They even play his song
during Monday Night Football.

34:12.458 --> 34:14.358
I'm asleep for four years.

34:14.460 --> 34:18.190
My dad moves out of town, my girlfrienďs
in Playboy, and your stupid friend is famous.

34:18.297 --> 34:20.527
Yep. Is kind of like
when Han got unfrozen in Jedi.

34:20.632 --> 34:24.433
Yeah, is exactly like
when Han got unfrozen in Jedi.

34:24.536 --> 34:27.370
Yo, whas up, everybody? You know who that was.

34:27.473 --> 34:30.203
Horsedick. MPEG with the track
"I'm-a Love a White Girl';...

34:30.309 --> 34:31.969
offhis multi-platinum CD Donkey Dong.

34:32.078 --> 34:34.978
Pick it up if you ain't heard.

34:35.081 --> 34:38.608
Wait a minute. If Horsedick's
the most famous person in the world...

34:38.717 --> 34:41.619
then he could get into
the Playboy Mansion, right?

34:41.721 --> 34:44.690
Oh, yeah. He could just walk right in.

34:51.496 --> 34:55.228
We should totally get
Horsedick. MPEG to get us in!

34:55.333 --> 34:58.235
He lives in Chicago. He's always
trying to get me to come up and visit.

34:58.337 --> 35:00.771
He'd be totally down to fly us
out to L.A. And hook us up.

35:00.873 --> 35:03.137
Good idea, Tucker.

35:03.242 --> 35:07.804
Okay. Well, at least we have
a plan now- Horsedick.

35:07.914 --> 35:10.280
Thas our plan. Horsedick.

35:10.383 --> 35:12.817
- Dot-MPEG.
- Dot-MPEG.

35:13.052 --> 35:14.815
All points bulletin.

35:14.921 --> 35:17.287
Be on the lookout for a Tucker Cleigh.

35:17.390 --> 35:21.326
White male, six foot five.
No visible tattoos.

35:21.427 --> 35:23.418
Last seen April 17.

35:23.529 --> 35:26.430
I just can't believe
the firemen were that angry.

35:26.532 --> 35:28.932
Dude, firemen
breathe noxious fumes all day.

35:29.035 --> 35:31.936
Is their job. Makes them psycho.

35:32.038 --> 35:33.938
I guess that makes sense.

35:34.040 --> 35:37.237
Trust me, dude. Firemen are bad news.

35:37.343 --> 35:40.676
Hey, Tucker, I don't really want
to go in there dressed like this.

35:40.780 --> 35:45.046
Can you get me like a shirt, some pants,
and I think a hoodie would be good.

35:45.151 --> 35:47.585
Sure, no sweat. Just fill her up for me.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.655
Wh- No! Tucker!

35:49.755 --> 35:51.950
I have atrophy!

36:19.018 --> 36:21.509
Ridiculous.

36:43.276 --> 36:45.244
Whoa.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.714
Hugh.

37:37.997 --> 37:39.897
Hey, this is Candace.

37:39.999 --> 37:44.902
I can't come to the phone right now because
I'm out hunting down my piece-of-shit boyfriend.

37:45.004 --> 37:48.030
Leave a message.

37:48.140 --> 37:51.337
Uh, h-hi, Candace.

37:51.444 --> 37:54.379
Thas a-Thas a pretty funny message.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.471
Um, look...

37:56.582 --> 38:01.281
I-I just wanted to call
and talk about what you did.

38:01.387 --> 38:06.848
Um, I want you to know
that I'm not mad at you...

38:06.959 --> 38:10.861
and I realize that you seemed...

38:10.963 --> 38:13.056
a little...

38:13.165 --> 38:15.065
cross.

38:15.167 --> 38:18.568
And I may have overreacted
a little bit to you biting me.

38:18.671 --> 38:21.572
But... you know how I am.

38:21.674 --> 38:26.634
My brain just shuts down whenever
I feel like I'm close to getting some.

38:29.181 --> 38:31.843
Anyway, I just-

38:31.951 --> 38:36.547
I hope this doesn't get in the way of us
hooking up and hanging out and stuff-

38:38.658 --> 38:41.627
Because I really like doing that.

38:43.329 --> 38:48.028
I mean, not like we're
exclusive or anything.

38:48.134 --> 38:51.035
By the way, did your answering machine
say "my boyfriend"?

38:51.137 --> 38:53.037
Because-weird.

38:53.139 --> 38:55.198
I mean, we've talked about that.

38:55.308 --> 38:59.210
Um, anyway, I guess
I'm just trying to say...

38:59.312 --> 39:01.371
I forgive you.

39:01.480 --> 39:04.040
I just hope...

39:04.150 --> 39:07.051
you're not gonna be a dick about this.

39:07.153 --> 39:09.121
Okay, bye.

39:19.298 --> 39:22.734
Well, I think I patched
things up with Candace.

39:22.835 --> 39:24.860
Why is your dress all wet?

39:25.971 --> 39:27.871
Give me my clothes.

39:39.952 --> 39:42.113
Really?

39:42.221 --> 39:44.519
That shirs awesome, man.

39:47.159 --> 39:49.389
I'm getting pretty tired.

39:49.495 --> 39:52.931
- Do you want to get a motel or something?
- No, man, I'm wired.

39:53.032 --> 39:56.229
I ate, like, 10 packets of those Horny Goat
Weed stamina things at the gas station.

39:56.335 --> 39:58.462
You can get some shut-eye though.

39:59.638 --> 40:03.631
All right, just wake me
if you need me, okay?

40:03.743 --> 40:05.870
And, Tucker...

40:05.978 --> 40:09.379
thank you for everything.

40:09.482 --> 40:11.575
No problem, dude.
We're homeys. Lock it up.

40:11.684 --> 40:13.584
Hey! Hey!

40:13.686 --> 40:16.211
- Whoa! Sorry.
- Asshole.

40:16.322 --> 40:18.552
Just watch the road. Okay?

40:18.657 --> 40:20.625
Will do.

40:21.827 --> 40:23.795
Good night.

40:37.076 --> 40:39.067
Hey, Eugene.

40:39.178 --> 40:41.942
- Want to party?
- Cindi.

40:42.047 --> 40:47.349
I got tired of waiting for you,
Eugene, so I went out and I blew everyone.

40:47.453 --> 40:50.945
- No! Cindi!
- Why did you have to get drunk, Eugene?

40:51.056 --> 40:54.617
- Why couldn't you just make love to me?
- No! I'm sorry!

40:54.727 --> 40:57.457
You've turned me into a whore, Eugene.

40:57.563 --> 41:00.589
This is a venereal disease, Eugene...

41:00.699 --> 41:03.133
and I have thousands of them.

41:03.235 --> 41:05.931
- No!
- I'm just like your brother, Eugene!

41:06.038 --> 41:09.007
Just like your brother!

41:09.108 --> 41:10.939
No!

41:19.118 --> 41:20.881
What state are we in?

41:22.755 --> 41:25.656
- Hey. Tucker.
- What?

41:28.160 --> 41:30.060
Sorry about that.

41:30.162 --> 41:34.155
I started drinking all this NyQuil because that
Horny Goat Weed was giving me the jitters.

41:34.266 --> 41:36.996
There's clothes in this bag if you want them.

41:37.102 --> 41:39.662
But I feel good to go now.
We don't need to stay here.

41:39.772 --> 41:43.208
Tucker, you can't drive all night long
without sleep. Is not safe.

41:43.309 --> 41:46.210
I got some sleep in the car. I'm serious.

41:46.312 --> 41:49.213
We could go get our money back
from the motel, jump back in the car...

41:49.315 --> 41:53.081
be in Chicago in a couple hours, and then
by this time tomorrow be at the mansion.

41:53.185 --> 41:55.050
Tucker, is 4:00 in the morning.

41:55.154 --> 41:57.054
The stupid fucking mansion can wait.

41:58.157 --> 42:00.250
The stupid what-ing mansion?

42:00.359 --> 42:02.259
Oh, God.

42:02.361 --> 42:04.886
That mansion is a historical
and cultural landmark...

42:04.997 --> 42:08.398
where some of the greatest minds
have gathered to exchange ideas and-

42:08.501 --> 42:11.197
And watch naked ladies
take baths together. Yes, I know.

42:11.303 --> 42:14.670
Oh, my God. You don't know.

42:14.773 --> 42:17.867
I need to give you a crash course
in sophistication and the Playboy way.

42:17.977 --> 42:20.411
You're gonna give me
a lesson in sophistication?

42:20.513 --> 42:24.574
Yeah. I've had a subscription
to this magazine for, like, 13 years.

42:24.683 --> 42:28.244
God, you're right, Tucker.
Teach me more about etiquette.

42:28.354 --> 42:30.254
Okay.

42:30.356 --> 42:32.221
Here, put this on.

42:32.324 --> 42:34.519
Ow. I don't wanna.

42:34.627 --> 42:36.754
Put it on.

42:36.862 --> 42:41.424
This is a bathrobe. We'll probably be issued
one of these when we get to the mansion.

42:41.534 --> 42:43.729
Is the western equivalent
of the Greek toga.

42:43.836 --> 42:45.736
There's a stain on mine.

42:45.838 --> 42:48.864
It signifies both power and leisure.

42:48.974 --> 42:50.874
Say that with me-

42:50.976 --> 42:53.604
power and leisure.

42:53.712 --> 42:56.738
Say it. Power and leisure.

42:56.849 --> 42:58.407
Power and leisure.

42:58.517 --> 43:00.109
Good. Now, lesson two.

43:00.219 --> 43:03.120
When you get to the mansion
and you see a pretty girl...

43:03.222 --> 43:05.918
you can't just walk up to her
and ask her to have sex with you.

43:06.025 --> 43:08.459
Okay.

43:08.561 --> 43:11.462
You have to engage her in
stimulating conversation first.

43:11.564 --> 43:13.464
Find out who she is.

43:13.566 --> 43:15.864
Ask her questions like
what is her favorite animal...

43:15.968 --> 43:17.936
or whas her most embarrassing moment?

43:20.239 --> 43:22.469
This is a pipe.

43:22.575 --> 43:26.875
Smoking a pipe is the equivalent
of wearing a fine tuxedo.

43:30.382 --> 43:32.145
Tucker!

43:43.262 --> 43:45.890
- This usually never happens.
- Shut up, Tucker.

43:50.769 --> 43:54.762
Uh-oh, dude, here come the firemen.

44:11.490 --> 44:14.254
Uh-oh, dude, here come the firemen.

44:15.594 --> 44:18.654
They know about Candace!

44:21.066 --> 44:23.500
Come on. Get in.

44:24.770 --> 44:27.534
- We must be three states away!
- Firemen talk, dude.

44:28.841 --> 44:31.332
You're a dead man, Tucker Cleigh!

44:57.936 --> 44:59.904
How's that atrophy coming?

45:05.744 --> 45:07.712
Are you still mad?

45:13.285 --> 45:16.686
Hey, do you want to
get something to eat or anything?

45:16.789 --> 45:18.689
Well, how much money do we have?

45:18.791 --> 45:23.854
Because we just spent 75 bucks on a motel
room that we got to use for all of five minutes.

45:23.962 --> 45:27.125
Les see. I've got... seven dollars.

45:27.232 --> 45:29.928
Do you have any money?

45:30.035 --> 45:32.833
No, I don't have any money.
I don't have a bank account.

45:32.938 --> 45:36.430
I've been in a coma since high school.

45:36.542 --> 45:38.442
Okay. Seven bucks.

45:38.544 --> 45:41.411
Seven bucks should be enough
to feed the both of us.

45:52.605 --> 45:55.733
- Are you mad?
- Yes, I'm mad!

45:55.841 --> 45:59.868
What kind of fuckin' idiot goes on a
cross-country road trip with less than $100?

45:59.979 --> 46:03.176
Well, to be fair, dude,
I had to buy you all those clothes...

46:03.282 --> 46:06.342
and you're the one
that wanted to stay at the motel.

46:06.452 --> 46:09.683
You had to buy clothes for me
because you kidnapped me...

46:09.789 --> 46:13.054
and I wanted the motel
because you almost killed me!

46:13.159 --> 46:16.492
But then wait! You burned down the motel
and almost killed me yet again.

46:16.595 --> 46:21.692
And then you pissed off firemen
and almost got me killed yet another time!

46:21.801 --> 46:25.897
- I think you're overreacting a little bit.
- I am not overreacting!

46:26.005 --> 46:30.169
I am trying to reclaim my life here, Tucker,
and you're not taking this seriously.

46:30.276 --> 46:33.143
This is all some dumb excuse
for you to go to the mansion...

46:33.245 --> 46:37.773
so you can finally rub up on all those strippers
you've been dreaming about your whole life.

46:40.119 --> 46:43.577
Rub up? Strippers?

46:43.689 --> 46:46.123
We talked about this last night...

46:46.225 --> 46:49.319
and I will not allow that sort of filth
or degrading speech...

46:49.428 --> 46:51.328
in my car!

46:51.430 --> 46:53.330
Oh, look! Horsedick.

47:23.295 --> 47:25.855
- Speak.
- Just got a visual confirmation.

47:25.965 --> 47:28.229
They've been spotted
in Chicago.

47:31.003 --> 47:34.905
#Uh, wh-what did you say #

47:35.007 --> 47:37.532
#You know who it is #

47:39.945 --> 47:41.708
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

47:41.814 --> 47:44.442
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

47:44.550 --> 47:46.882
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

47:46.986 --> 47:49.511
# Suck upon my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

47:49.622 --> 47:51.954
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

47:52.057 --> 47:54.218
# Suck upon my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

47:54.326 --> 47:56.760
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

47:56.862 --> 47:59.194
# Suck upon my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

47:59.298 --> 48:01.698
#Your dick while you fuck my ass #

48:01.800 --> 48:04.928
- Yeah. Quit singin'-
- #Your dick while you fuck my ass #

48:05.037 --> 48:07.369
- and suck my dick.
- #Your dick while you fuck my ass, hey #

48:07.473 --> 48:10.408
- You know, these lyrics don't even make any sense.
- What?

48:10.509 --> 48:12.909
Shut up, Eugene.
This song is awesome.

48:13.012 --> 48:16.175
I wish Candace were here.
She would love this song.

48:16.282 --> 48:19.581
Tucker, if Candace were here right now,
she would try and kill you.

48:19.685 --> 48:22.051
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

48:22.154 --> 48:24.588
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

48:24.690 --> 48:27.284
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

48:27.393 --> 48:29.623
# Suck upon my dick
while I fuck that ass #

48:29.728 --> 48:32.094
#Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

48:32.198 --> 48:34.428
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

48:34.533 --> 48:37.229
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

48:37.336 --> 48:39.531
# Suck upon my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

48:39.638 --> 48:42.198
Bitch!
#That ass, hey #

48:42.308 --> 48:44.776
#Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass ##

48:46.412 --> 48:48.312
Respect.

48:48.414 --> 48:51.076
Cut. Thas a wrap.

48:51.183 --> 48:53.743
Great job, Horsedick. MPEG.
Hip-hop is back!

48:53.852 --> 48:55.877
- You think they're gonna get the message though?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

48:55.988 --> 48:57.888
- Yo, Horsedick.
- Yo, yo, yo.

48:57.990 --> 48:59.924
You know these dudes, man?

49:00.025 --> 49:03.461
Hell, yeah! Tucker Cleigh
from the down S. C!

49:03.562 --> 49:06.554
What up, brother?

49:06.665 --> 49:10.101
- How you feel, man?
- Great, man. Thanks for letting us visit your shoot.

49:10.202 --> 49:11.726
- Of course. Any time.
- You remember Eugene from prom?

49:13.489 --> 49:16.515
- Oh, the Stairmaster. How you doin', man?
- Good.

49:16.625 --> 49:18.923
I heard you was all
Regarding Henry and shit.

49:19.027 --> 49:22.360
- Yeah, I was in a coma for a while.
- Thas cool.

49:22.464 --> 49:24.489
I see you've been doin' really well.
Congratulations.

49:24.599 --> 49:28.729
Thanks, bro. Man, my last CD dropped,
motherfuckers got killed at the Tower Records.

49:28.837 --> 49:32.034
- Motherfuckers got killed!
- Whoa. Thas awesome.

49:32.140 --> 49:35.405
Thank God. You know what I'm sayin'?
What brings y'all to Chicago?

49:35.510 --> 49:38.035
- We just came to see you, dog.
- Okay.

49:38.146 --> 49:40.046
Dude.

49:40.148 --> 49:42.742
Oh, and we were wondering if you could
get us into the Playboy Mansion.

49:42.851 --> 49:44.079
Most definitely.

49:46.187 --> 49:50.248
Wow, Horsedick. You're very generous with
your time and resources.

49:50.358 --> 49:53.885
Anything for my bro, man.
Come on. Lock it up. Come on. Lock it up.

49:53.995 --> 49:56.520
See? I told you Horsedick
would hook us up.

49:56.631 --> 50:00.965
We're gonna have you back in Cindi's arms
in no time. Then you can finally have sex.

50:03.171 --> 50:05.469
Finally have sex? You a virgin?

50:07.309 --> 50:10.437
Are you tellin' me you're-Turn the music off!

50:10.545 --> 50:13.912
Do you mean to tell me
you have never been with a woman?

50:14.015 --> 50:16.108
Never?

50:16.217 --> 50:19.243
I was going to in high school,
but, uh, then I fell down the stairs.

50:19.354 --> 50:21.982
Crystal! Janine!

50:22.090 --> 50:25.491
Get your asses in here
and have sex with this man!

50:25.593 --> 50:28.289
- Oh, no, Horsedick.
- Dot-MPEG.

50:28.396 --> 50:30.728
Dot-MPEG, yes. Thas not necessary.

50:30.832 --> 50:33.767
I'm saving myself, uh,
for my girlfriend...

50:33.868 --> 50:35.335
who's gonna be at the party...

50:35.437 --> 50:38.270
so thank you, but I'm gonna wait.

50:40.742 --> 50:43.609
- I'll have sex with those girls.
- Come hook my brother up.

50:43.712 --> 50:45.441
I gotta take a shit.

50:45.547 --> 50:47.811
- You okay with just Crystal?
- Yeah, thas cool.

50:48.883 --> 50:50.976
Come on, baby.

50:55.256 --> 50:58.851
You and me gonna have a long talk.

50:58.960 --> 51:03.158
We gonna smoke this here,
and you gonna tell Uncle Horsedick...

51:03.264 --> 51:05.425
exactly what the problem is.

51:05.533 --> 51:09.299
Thank you again,
Horsedick. MPEG, but I don't smoke.

51:09.404 --> 51:10.996
Look here, man.

51:11.106 --> 51:13.734
This is a party bus.

51:13.842 --> 51:17.539
There's only one rule on a party bus-
You got to party.

51:17.645 --> 51:21.274
So you're either gonna fuck
one of them girls, or you smoke this "J."

51:21.383 --> 51:24.477
We out of toilet paper.

51:32.093 --> 51:33.993
#Bounce that, bounce that #

51:34.095 --> 51:36.620
#Know that I'm a better man #

51:38.233 --> 51:40.633
#So now you can know my name #

51:40.735 --> 51:44.000
#Girl, you gotta bounce that #

51:44.105 --> 51:45.868
#Nonstop to the break of dawn #

51:45.974 --> 51:48.306
#Know that I'm a better man #

51:48.410 --> 51:51.243
#Whoa, whoa #

51:51.346 --> 51:53.576
I gotta warn you,
I'm a little drunk, so...

51:53.681 --> 51:55.649
this could take two or three minutes.

51:55.750 --> 51:58.947
- # Sittin'on the pillow like a porno star#
- Shh.

51:59.053 --> 52:01.419
#See-through panties
and a push-up bra #

52:01.523 --> 52:03.218
#Look so good #

52:07.962 --> 52:12.296
I don't understand it. I mean, how much
can a person change in four years?

52:12.400 --> 52:14.368
Is, like, I knew her.

52:14.469 --> 52:17.233
You know, like, I really knew her.

52:17.338 --> 52:22.241
Then you wake up,
and she's a completely different person.

52:24.779 --> 52:27.213
This bitch one time...

52:27.315 --> 52:30.341
tore my heart out, man, for reals, yo.

52:30.452 --> 52:33.182
- Oh, Horsedick.
- Dot-MPEG.

52:33.288 --> 52:35.188
Dot-MPEG.

52:36.891 --> 52:40.793
You know, I think
I'm startin' to feel high.

52:42.430 --> 52:45.888
I don't even know where I am.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.127
What was we talking about?

52:48.236 --> 52:50.602
#Take that off#

52:50.705 --> 52:54.232
- You like this?
- Uh- Uh-huh.

52:58.513 --> 53:00.447
You want this?

53:00.548 --> 53:03.039
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

53:03.151 --> 53:07.053
Then come and get it.

53:07.155 --> 53:10.318
# You comin'one more time #

53:12.861 --> 53:16.228
Goddamn. Hey, Charlie.
Control this motherfuckin'bus.

53:19.934 --> 53:21.959
Crazy-ass bus driver.

53:23.204 --> 53:27.106
#Girl, you gotta bounce that #

53:27.208 --> 53:29.199
#So now you can know my name #

53:29.310 --> 53:32.302
#Know that I'm a better man #

53:32.413 --> 53:34.779
#So now you can know my name #

53:34.883 --> 53:38.182
#Girl, you gotta bounce that #

53:38.286 --> 53:42.086
#Nonstop to the break of dawn ##

53:42.190 --> 53:44.522
She said the most...

53:46.961 --> 53:49.657
mean, hurtful things...

53:49.764 --> 53:51.664
to people...

53:53.234 --> 53:55.634
and they laughed at me.

53:55.737 --> 53:57.967
And it was-

53:58.072 --> 54:01.166
So thas why, you know, I'm a dog now.

54:01.276 --> 54:03.005
Cut through bitches like water.

54:03.111 --> 54:06.103
No emotional attachment.
Ain't that right, Tuck?

54:06.214 --> 54:08.876
- Huh? What?
- How was it back there, man?

54:08.983 --> 54:12.578
Good. Real- Really good.

54:13.888 --> 54:17.221
- I gotta go to bed.
- Ha! Ha-ha-ha!

54:17.325 --> 54:20.055
He's tired! Thas what I'm talkin' about!

54:29.085 --> 54:31.986
When you give something to a bitch...

54:32.088 --> 54:34.056
they don't do nothin' but take.

54:35.391 --> 54:38.622
Thas why I don't give 'em
nothin'but the dick.

54:40.529 --> 54:42.963
'Cause they can't take that away.

54:45.167 --> 54:48.068
You'll see tomorrow at the mansion.

54:48.170 --> 54:52.504
We'll run a train on, like,
seven, eight, nine, 11 of them honeys!

54:52.608 --> 54:54.576
Ain't a Playmate there I ain't tagged yet.

54:54.677 --> 54:56.838
Wait a minute. What?

54:56.946 --> 54:58.937
All of them, dog.

54:59.048 --> 55:01.915
Okay. Horsedick,
you couldn't have "hit" all of them.

55:02.017 --> 55:05.418
- I mean, thas crazy.
- Miss January on my dick.

55:05.521 --> 55:08.081
Miss February on my dick.

55:08.190 --> 55:10.590
- Miss March?
- On my dick, dog!

55:10.693 --> 55:12.661
Cindi Whitehall.
Have you had sex with her?

55:12.762 --> 55:15.754
Man, I had that bitch
screamin' like her house was on fire.

55:15.865 --> 55:18.857
She was chompin' down on my dick
like it was a hot-dog eating contest...

55:18.968 --> 55:20.936
and she was some little Asian dude.

55:29.378 --> 55:31.278
What the fuck?

55:38.354 --> 55:40.788
Get the fuck back here, you pervert!

55:40.890 --> 55:43.358
I hope you get V.D.
And your dick falls off!

55:43.459 --> 55:46.917
Cindi would never sleep with you!

55:48.497 --> 55:51.193
Oh, fuck.

55:52.334 --> 55:54.234
You all right, man?

55:54.336 --> 55:56.463
She slept with him.

55:56.572 --> 56:00.099
She slept with a shallow,
ignorant asshole like that!

56:03.779 --> 56:05.747
How could she do that?

56:07.449 --> 56:11.180
I don't even know what I'm doing out here,
Tucker. She's gone!

56:11.287 --> 56:16.020
She's not gone, man.
She just had sex with a guy.

56:16.125 --> 56:18.093
She's still Cindi.

56:18.194 --> 56:20.662
But we had something special.

56:23.499 --> 56:25.490
You wouldn't understand, Tucker.

56:25.601 --> 56:27.569
Come on, man.

56:28.838 --> 56:31.033
We got a long way to walk.

56:39.582 --> 56:42.415
Man, I wish Candace were here.

56:42.518 --> 56:45.385
Really? Again?

56:45.487 --> 56:47.455
She's trying to kill you.

56:47.556 --> 56:51.014
Yeah. She has a car though.

56:51.126 --> 56:53.720
We have 12 hours
to get across two states.

56:55.030 --> 56:58.989
Hey!

56:59.101 --> 57:01.365
People are assholes.

57:01.470 --> 57:05.065
Someone will stop.
Don't worry, dude. Things work out.

57:05.174 --> 57:07.642
No, they don't. Things do not work out.

57:07.743 --> 57:11.702
I am living proof of that.

57:11.814 --> 57:16.080
Are you boys looking for a ride?

57:16.185 --> 57:20.884
Here is the deal.
I am Katja. This is my girlfriend, Vonka.

57:20.990 --> 57:23.550
Your... girlfriend?

57:23.659 --> 57:26.992
Yes. We're lesbians. Does that bother you?

57:28.163 --> 57:29.630
No. No. No.

57:29.732 --> 57:33.168
We're driving to Los Angeles,
but we are just so madly in love...

57:33.269 --> 57:35.737
that we can't keep our hands
off each other.

57:35.838 --> 57:38.636
We have to make out
and make love all the time.

57:38.741 --> 57:41.107
- Oh.
- Oh.

57:41.210 --> 57:43.804
So we need you boys
to drive the car to Los Angeles...

57:43.913 --> 57:45.904
so we can get crazy in the backseat...

57:46.015 --> 57:49.917
and make love and suck
and fuck each other the whole way.

57:50.019 --> 57:51.953
Can you boys do that?

57:53.923 --> 57:57.154
Yeah. Yeah. We-We can do that.

58:10.906 --> 58:13.534
Katja.

58:13.642 --> 58:17.009
Oh. Right there. Katja!

58:32.795 --> 58:36.663
Whoa! Aah!

58:40.435 --> 58:45.304
- Is there going to be a problem?
- No. No.

58:45.406 --> 58:48.534
You almost make me bite Vonka's labia.

58:48.643 --> 58:50.611
Oh, sweet God.

59:14.102 --> 59:17.094
Thirty miles to Los Angeles.
We're almost there.

59:22.110 --> 59:25.546
Is this going to happen
every five minutes?

59:25.646 --> 59:28.444
No. No. I got it. I got it.

59:30.485 --> 59:33.648
No.

59:33.755 --> 59:35.985
Ain't seen shit in here.

59:38.292 --> 59:41.853
Speak.

59:41.963 --> 59:44.989
One of our trucks saw them
heading into Los Angeles.

59:45.099 --> 59:47.932
Los Angeles. Of course.

59:48.035 --> 59:50.526
Yeah, but the trail goes cold after that.

59:50.638 --> 59:52.606
No, it doesn't.

59:52.707 --> 59:56.609
You tell your men I know
exactly where he's going.

01:00:06.788 --> 01:00:09.951
Look, lesbians! Palm trees.

01:00:10.057 --> 01:00:13.493
You know, lesbians,
I didn't want to say anything before...

01:00:13.594 --> 01:00:16.586
but the car is really starting to smell.

01:00:17.598 --> 01:00:21.125
So we have an hour till this thing starts.
You know where the mansion is?

01:00:21.235 --> 01:00:26.298
10228 Charring Cross Road,
Los Angeles, California, 90024.

01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:29.510
Whas up, boys and girls?
I'm Carrie Keagan...

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:33.137
and we're at Playboy's
annual anniversary bash.

01:00:34.816 --> 01:00:38.343
I heard Horsedick. MPEG
is actually in the mansion right now.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.850
Wow. I can't believe we made it.

01:00:43.958 --> 01:00:46.688
My God. We're 20 minutes late.
They've already started the party.

01:00:48.663 --> 01:00:50.654
Look. I think right there
is where you sign in.

01:00:52.366 --> 01:00:54.357
Oh, no. You have to be on that list.

01:00:54.469 --> 01:00:58.098
Oh, man. We are way out of our league.
How the hell are we gonna get in here?

01:00:58.206 --> 01:01:00.800
We need some sort of angle.

01:01:00.908 --> 01:01:05.208
Oh, God!

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:14.846
Hey there, everybody.
We are here to party.

01:01:14.956 --> 01:01:19.256
- Just here with our dates now.
- Yeah. Not bad, huh?

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.386
Pretty good. Hey, those
are our dates. Hey, lesbians!

01:01:22.497 --> 01:01:25.728
- Those are our-
- Ow!

01:01:25.833 --> 01:01:28.700
- Whoo!
- Wow. Ow! Ow!

01:01:28.803 --> 01:01:32.330
That didn't work. Now what do we do?

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.465
Firemen!

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:37.610
Is a trap.

01:01:41.816 --> 01:01:44.512
Wait a minute. What the hell's going on?
There's no fire here.

01:01:44.619 --> 01:01:47.918
Sure there is. All right, men.
Keep your eyes peeled.

01:01:48.022 --> 01:01:50.149
He's around here somewhere.

01:01:53.027 --> 01:01:56.258
Cover the rear, gentlemen. Come on.
Les move. Les move, les move.

01:01:56.364 --> 01:01:58.559
Go on, move, move!

01:01:58.666 --> 01:02:00.793
Eugene.

01:02:00.902 --> 01:02:03.700
- I think I have a plan.
- What?

01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:06.466
- Follow me.
- No, Tucker. Wait!

01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:10.209
I'm afraid.

01:02:11.579 --> 01:02:13.479
Sorry about this, fellas.

01:02:13.581 --> 01:02:16.641
We're just dumb firemen
trying to do our jobs.

01:02:23.391 --> 01:02:26.292
#Come and get me to it #

01:02:28.129 --> 01:02:31.121
- # Show me how to do this #
- # Love my body Touch my body #

01:02:31.232 --> 01:02:33.427
#Get your body movin'#

01:02:35.536 --> 01:02:38.994
- # You like how I do it #
- # Kiss my body, kiss my body #

01:02:39.106 --> 01:02:41.836
#Just sittin'here watching your curves
thinking it worked #

01:02:41.943 --> 01:02:44.468
#Thinking my vision's blurred ##

01:02:44.579 --> 01:02:49.539
All right, boys! Keep your eyes peeled
for that son of a bitch Tucker Cleigh!

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:52.118
We have word he's at this party!

01:02:58.626 --> 01:03:01.561
Uh-uh. You gotta go to
the back of the line, lady.

01:03:01.662 --> 01:03:05.996
Yeah, have fun at the party. Let her in! Let her in.

01:03:07.969 --> 01:03:10.904
Damn. Bitch is crazy.

01:03:13.407 --> 01:03:15.375
Okay. First things first.

01:03:15.476 --> 01:03:17.808
Gotta get rid of these outfits
and get poolside.

01:03:17.912 --> 01:03:20.904
What? Tucker, you can't ditch your outfit.
What if the firemen see you?

01:03:21.015 --> 01:03:24.974
I can't work like this. Firemen
never get laid. Everyone knows that.

01:03:25.086 --> 01:03:28.578
- People hate firemen.
- What are you gonna do?

01:03:28.689 --> 01:03:31.556
I'm gonna go mingle.
There's three girls for every guy at this party.

01:03:31.659 --> 01:03:34.856
Okay. Fine. Do me a favor and keep
your eyes peeled for Cindi, all right?

01:03:34.962 --> 01:03:37.362
Okay. Good luck.

01:03:45.606 --> 01:03:48.336
Hey, ladies.

01:03:48.442 --> 01:03:51.275
I'm from South Carolina.

01:04:01.555 --> 01:04:05.355
Hey, gorgeous.
So-What are your hobbies?

01:04:05.459 --> 01:04:07.723
- My hobbies?
- Yeah. You know-

01:04:07.828 --> 01:04:09.955
What are your turn-ons?

01:04:10.064 --> 01:04:11.861
Shit. Where's my pepper spray?

01:04:15.469 --> 01:04:17.369
Ugh.

01:04:25.546 --> 01:04:27.514
Hey, girl of my dreams.

01:04:27.615 --> 01:04:29.583
Ugh!

01:04:32.486 --> 01:04:36.388
Hey! All right. MI LF.

01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:39.118
- I'm 25.
- Really?

01:04:39.226 --> 01:04:41.524
Fuck off.

01:04:50.504 --> 01:04:53.598
Sara Jean Underwood...

01:04:53.708 --> 01:04:55.938
Playmate of the Year, 2007?

01:04:56.043 --> 01:05:00.275
- Thas me.
- Oh, my God! Is such an honor to meet you!

01:05:00.381 --> 01:05:02.611
- Aw. Why, thank you.
- I'm Tucker Cleigh.

01:05:02.717 --> 01:05:04.617
And who is this little guy?

01:05:04.719 --> 01:05:08.655
Oh, this is Puddles, and he's a rescue.
I got him from the pound last week.

01:05:08.756 --> 01:05:10.519
Oh, no way.
I call the pound all the time.

01:05:10.624 --> 01:05:13.252
- You do?
- Yeah. Last week even.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:16.124
Some loser lost his jerk Labrador...

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:18.357
'cause I caught him going
through my trash looking for food.

01:05:18.466 --> 01:05:22.197
And you sent this
"jerk Labrador" to the pound?

01:05:22.303 --> 01:05:24.362
- Big time.
- Thas horrible.

01:05:24.472 --> 01:05:27.464
No. I know. I mean, what? Why?

01:05:27.575 --> 01:05:30.203
Because they put dogs
to sleep at the pound.

01:05:30.311 --> 01:05:34.213
They were gonna put Puddles here down
'cause he was sick and nobody would adopt him.

01:05:34.315 --> 01:05:37.182
So I took him home with me and I've
slowly been nursing him back to health.

01:05:37.284 --> 01:05:39.980
Whoa. Thas so weird.

01:05:40.087 --> 01:05:42.282
It is?

01:05:42.389 --> 01:05:45.153
I mean, I just- I didn't realize
that human beings...

01:05:45.259 --> 01:05:47.159
could nurse dogs.

01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:51.821
I'm not literally nursing him.

01:05:51.932 --> 01:05:54.958
Oh! I thought you meant with your-

01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:59.802
I'm sorry. I was-
I was thinking about... your boobs.

01:05:59.907 --> 01:06:04.276
- I mean, because that sort of
stuff does happen nowadays...

01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:06.312
especially with modern times.

01:06:06.413 --> 01:06:09.576
And I've seen that
on the Internet a bunch.

01:06:09.683 --> 01:06:11.776
You've seen a lot of that
on the Internet?

01:06:11.886 --> 01:06:13.877
Yeah, I mean-

01:06:13.988 --> 01:06:18.857
Some girls will even have s-
make love to dogs on the Internet.

01:06:18.959 --> 01:06:22.486
Not that thas good at all,
'cause thas bad-

01:06:22.596 --> 01:06:26.430
Unless you do that, and then,
whatever. I'm not judging.

01:06:26.534 --> 01:06:29.697
I'm sorry, Tucker.
Who is it that you're here with again?

01:06:29.804 --> 01:06:32.932
I-I'm sorry. I have such
a problem with rambling...

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.600
especially when I'm
meeting people like you.

01:06:35.709 --> 01:06:38.735
I'm always blowing first impressions.

01:06:38.846 --> 01:06:41.212
Can we just start over?
Give me another chance.

01:06:41.315 --> 01:06:43.215
Can I get you a drink or anything?

01:06:43.317 --> 01:06:45.911
Thas sweet, Tucker, but I actually
have to take Puddles out to the lawn.

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:48.784
- He has to go to the bathroom pretty badly.
- I'll take him to the bathroom!

01:06:48.889 --> 01:06:50.652
No, thas really not necessary.

01:06:50.758 --> 01:06:52.726
I insist. Is the least I can do.

01:06:52.827 --> 01:06:56.058
- Please?
- Okay.

01:06:56.163 --> 01:06:58.393
Okay, Tucker. You win.

01:06:58.499 --> 01:07:01.832
You won't regret this,
Playmate of the Year, 2007!

01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:03.904
Bring him right back!

01:07:06.106 --> 01:07:11.669
Oh, my God.
That is the cutest little dog I've ever seen.

01:07:11.779 --> 01:07:13.644
- Is it yours?
- Um-

01:07:13.747 --> 01:07:16.045
- What is his name?
- I think is, uh-

01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:19.142
Oh, my God! Look at his little feet!

01:07:19.253 --> 01:07:21.153
I love men with dogs.

01:07:21.255 --> 01:07:22.847
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:25.585
My last boyfriend hated dogs.
Such an asshole!

01:07:25.693 --> 01:07:28.491
I mean, what kind of psycho doesn't like dogs?

01:07:28.596 --> 01:07:31.030
And thas just when I knew
that he was not for me.

01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:33.565
I mean, look at his little paws!

01:07:33.667 --> 01:07:36.932
- Yeah, they're pretty small.
- I know, right?

01:07:37.037 --> 01:07:39.528
Oh. Oh, uh-

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.905
Mmm. What?

01:07:44.245 --> 01:07:48.511
- Nothing.
- I just want to talk to you all night.

01:07:48.616 --> 01:07:51.449
Can you get me, like, another drink?

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.917
Wow! You're good!

01:07:59.059 --> 01:08:00.959
This tastes like shit!

01:08:01.061 --> 01:08:03.461
I mean, the other one
tasted different, you know.

01:08:03.564 --> 01:08:07.022
- It tasted like- I don't know-
- Pee?

01:08:07.134 --> 01:08:10.297
No! You're funny.

01:08:10.404 --> 01:08:14.238
Okay. Here's the plan.
I'm gonna go use the little girls'room.

01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:16.707
You're gonna go find me
some more of the good stuff.

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:19.904
And then we're gonna rendezvous
back here in, like, five minutes, okay?

01:08:20.014 --> 01:08:22.573
And make sure you bring him!

01:08:22.683 --> 01:08:25.049
Okay. Bye.

01:08:32.091 --> 01:08:33.992
...cute T-shirt.

01:08:34.094 --> 01:08:36.062
I'm, like, thas cool.
Whatever. Make a wish.

01:08:36.162 --> 01:08:39.256
Then this little motherfucker...

01:08:39.366 --> 01:08:42.733
hits me... and poops all over my bus.

01:08:42.836 --> 01:08:44.497
Man, I hate poop.

01:08:44.604 --> 01:08:47.665
I'm hopin' those little shits
do make it over here.

01:08:47.774 --> 01:08:51.643
Gonna kill that little bitch.
He's gonna suck my dick.

01:08:51.745 --> 01:08:54.645
I'm-a just gonna hold
his little dead head right there.

01:08:54.747 --> 01:08:56.648
Thas whas up, man.

01:08:57.885 --> 01:08:59.978
Thas whas up.

01:09:03.524 --> 01:09:06.823
Come on, Puddles. Come on.
Come on, Puddles. Come on.

01:09:06.926 --> 01:09:09.555
Whas the matter? Here we go. Here we go.

01:09:09.662 --> 01:09:12.256
Here we go. Here we go. Put it over that and go.

01:09:12.366 --> 01:09:14.493
Puddles, go to the bathroom.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.069
Whas the matter?

01:09:17.171 --> 01:09:19.162
Maybe you're empty.

01:09:19.273 --> 01:09:23.107
Um- No. Here we go. A little beer?

01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:25.508
Little beer. Little bit of beer.

01:09:25.612 --> 01:09:29.104
- Little bit of-
- Oh, my God!

01:09:29.216 --> 01:09:32.652
Oh, my God. Puddles.

01:09:34.721 --> 01:09:36.849
What the shit?

01:09:36.957 --> 01:09:39.926
- Oh! Sorry.
- Hi. May I help you?

01:09:40.027 --> 01:09:42.154
Um, no. No, thank you.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:46.130
Actually, yeah. Have you seen
Cindi Whitehall around here?

01:09:46.233 --> 01:09:49.031
Oh, my God. Are you a stalker?

01:09:49.136 --> 01:09:51.899
- We have a 2-14!
- What? I'm not a stalker.

01:09:52.006 --> 01:09:54.873
Oh, good. What are you drinkin'?

01:09:54.975 --> 01:09:57.307
Nothing. Never mind.

01:09:58.612 --> 01:10:01.581
So we're goin'at it
there in the driveway, and she's, like...

01:10:01.682 --> 01:10:06.244
"Oh, my God, this is the best
sex I have ever had."

01:10:06.353 --> 01:10:10.722
And I'm, like,
"Everyone keeps telling me that."

01:10:12.126 --> 01:10:14.026
Isn't that weird?

01:10:14.128 --> 01:10:16.028
Isn't-

01:10:40.854 --> 01:10:43.288
The Grotto.

01:10:47.227 --> 01:10:49.195
Um, excuse me, sir.
I'm looking for Cindi Whitehall.

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:55.148
- What you want with Cindi Whitehall?
- Oh, I'm her boyfriend.

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:58.515
- Or I was her boyfriend,
but then we got separated.
- We got a 2-14.

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.884
No, no, no. I'm not a stalker.
Ow! I'm not a stalker!

01:11:00.989 --> 01:11:03.389
I came across the country
just to see her!

01:11:03.492 --> 01:11:05.153
Hey, l-

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:15.836
Cindi. Cindi!

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.904
No, Cindi! I'm her boyfriend
from high school!

01:11:20.008 --> 01:11:23.136
- Eugene?
- We were sweethearts in high school!

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:26.339
- Cindi.
- Eugene?

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:29.713
Oh. Candace.

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:31.786
Good to see you.

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:34.321
I was worried sick.

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:37.551
Uh, how are you?

01:11:37.659 --> 01:11:39.854
Your face looks-

01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:44.897
Comin' along.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.026
By the way, sorry about that.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:51.072
Did I ever tell you that,
'cause I'm not sure-

01:11:51.173 --> 01:11:55.371
- You get back here, Tucker Cleigh!
- There he is! Everybody move!

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:58.002
Ow! Let me go! Ow!

01:11:58.113 --> 01:12:00.741
- Ow!
- You're gonna sit your ass here
till the police show up!

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:04.842
I need to talk to Cindi!
I'm not a stalker! I know her!

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:09.824
Quick! To the second floor!

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.893
Fan out.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:19.699
- Check on this floor.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.468
Come on, boys. He went that way.

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:30.242
Lesbians! Help me break this door down.

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:32.245
Where are the bedrooms?

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:35.976
Vonka and I thought of a new position,
and we need a bed against a wall.

01:12:36.084 --> 01:12:38.416
There's bedrooms through this door!
And Jacuzzis too.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.114
- There are?
- Jacuzzis?

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:45.284
- Yeah. But is locked. You gotta help me.
- Step aside.

01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:13.948
- Okay. Come on. Go, go, go, go, go!
- There he is. Get him.

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:22.190
Good idea, lesbians!

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:25.266
Lesbians! Lesbians!

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:41.279
What seems to be the problem, son?

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:43.851
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:47.012
I can't look. I can't look.
I can't look, I can't look.

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:51.024
- Oh! Oh! I can't- Oh, my God!
- Relax, son. Whas your name?

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:54.095
Oh! Tucker Cleigh, sir.

01:13:54.196 --> 01:13:56.824
And I am your biggest fan.

01:13:56.932 --> 01:14:01.369
I try to apply your methods and principles
to every aspect of my life.

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:04.303
Oh, yeah? How's that workin'out for you?

01:14:04.406 --> 01:14:08.502
- Good. Great. Awesome.
- Well, thas great.

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:12.068
The party's outside. Have a good time.

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:19.717
Something wrong?

01:14:22.557 --> 01:14:26.118
Well, yeah, actually.

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:32.366
Things haven't been going
so great for me lately.

01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:35.868
I mean, I'm here at the Playboy Mansion...

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:40.431
and-
I'm still striking out.

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:42.442
I don't get it.

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:46.046
Have a seat, son.

01:14:49.885 --> 01:14:51.785
Eugene?

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:53.548
Cindi.

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:56.180
Oh, my God! I can't believe this!

01:14:56.291 --> 01:15:00.387
- When did you wake up?
- About three days ago.

01:15:00.495 --> 01:15:04.261
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't too hard.

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:07.426
- What does that mean?
- Where have you been?

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:09.436
What?

01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:12.803
- Where have you been?
- I've been a couple of places.

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:14.808
- Been working.
- Working?

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:18.038
Working as what? A whore?

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:21.379
- Stop that! I know him.
- Ow!

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:26.113
Sorry, miss. It just really sticks in my craw
when people disrespect women.

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:28.086
What?

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:31.057
Eugene, how could you say
something like that?

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:32.990
- You left me!
- Eugene, l-

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:35.655
You left me in a hospital bed
when I needed you the most.

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:37.959
Eugene, you were in a coma for four years.

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:41.866
Yeah! I was in a coma, and you've been
running around doing God knows what.

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.734
- What are you talking about?
- You're doing pornography.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.638
You're posing naked for everyone to see.

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:50.974
- Eugene.
- How many guys have you slept with, Cindi?

01:15:51.079 --> 01:15:53.377
100? 200?

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:58.251
Ow! Ah.

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:02.653
Just imagine how you would feel, Cindi...

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:05.192
if you woke up one morning...

01:16:05.293 --> 01:16:08.421
and everyone that you loved
had left you...

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.259
and your dad had bailed on you...

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:13.994
and the one person that you thought
would always be there for you...

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:16.627
is out flashing her tits to the world...

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:20.299
and blowing everyone she meets. Ow!

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:22.340
So, you-you have a girlfriend.

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:26.744
Yeah, and she's great.
She's the coolest chick I've ever met.

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:29.544
Most girls want to kill me
after two or three nights...

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:31.983
and it took her 13 whole months.

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:34.885
Then whas the problem?
Sounds like you found a great girl.

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:37.618
She is great. Is just-

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:41.787
I can't get settled down yet.
I have to hit a respectable quota.

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:45.856
Tucker, is the quality,
not the quantity...

01:16:45.967 --> 01:16:48.800
of the relationships that counts.

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:51.896
But you're dating seven women at once.

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:57.879
Here. Look at this.

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:02.073
Oh! Gross!

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:05.347
- Thas Gertrude VonBrauer.
- Whas wrong with her eye?

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:07.251
- Is dead.
- Aah!

01:17:07.355 --> 01:17:09.983
Gertrude was my next door neighbor.

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:13.926
Our childhood friendship
blossomed into a romance by high school.

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:15.656
Hef, no!

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.664
Tucker, yes.

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:20.826
Gertrude VonBrauer
was the love of my life.

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:23.632
But she's, like...

01:17:23.738 --> 01:17:27.765
the worst-looking person I have ever seen.

01:17:27.876 --> 01:17:30.106
Give me back that photograph.

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:39.018
Gertrude died when she was 18 years old.

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:41.282
Oh, thank God.

01:17:43.391 --> 01:17:45.450
Tucker, the point I'm trying to make...

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.154
is that when you find
that special someone in your life...

01:17:48.263 --> 01:17:50.197
you have to hold on to them.

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:53.893
Now, I've known
quite a few women in my life...

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:56.937
and I've had a phenomenal sex life.

01:17:57.038 --> 01:18:00.166
But I'd trade it all in
for just one more afternoon...

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:03.802
with this young 18-year-old girl
from Milford, Kentucky.

01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:05.777
Who's busted.

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:09.339
Tucker, there's a bunny...

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:12.249
deep down inside each and every woman.

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:17.256
They're just not bunnies
you'd put in your magazine.

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.259
No, they're not.

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:22.159
But if you can see
the bunny in those girls...

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:25.028
then you're on to something, my friend.

01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:28.726
I think I get it.

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:33.797
I was trying to turn my girlfriend
into a Playboy bunny...

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:35.877
and thas why she had that seizure...

01:18:35.977 --> 01:18:38.502
and I stabbed her in the face a bunch.

01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:41.741
But if I just realized she was a bunny...

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:45.445
then none of these firemen
would be trying to kill me.

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:50.015
I gotta be honest with you.
I'm gonna call Security.

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:52.355
Okay, Mr. Hefner. Thanks for the talk.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:55.588
No problem, son.

01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:58.492
Look, I've said what I have to say.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.898
There's nothing else to do.

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:04.631
Things will never be the same because I
am always gonna think...

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:08.368
about you with those guys.

01:19:08.476 --> 01:19:11.934
I don't even know why I came here.

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:14.481
Closure, I think.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:19.520
Eugene, everything I've done since
you fell down the stairs has been for you.

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:22.886
Oh, yeah, right. Posing naked in Playboy
is really helping me out a lot.

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:24.891
Thanks for that.

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:27.359
Eugene, where do you think
the money came from?

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:30.056
- What money?
- The money for your hospital care.

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.368
Your dad didn't think
that you would ever wake up...

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:38.462
and he was gonna have you
moved to a class "D" hospice where they-

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:41.041
where they basically
just store you till you die.

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:44.507
I sent whatever money I could...

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:46.581
from part-time waitressing
during college...

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:48.706
but it never really amounted to much.

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:51.650
Then I started making
some real money modeling...

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:53.880
and had you moved
to a better treatment center.

01:19:56.524 --> 01:19:59.425
Tucker never told you any of this?

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:05.666
No. He never did.

01:20:07.135 --> 01:20:09.501
Okay. Hef s orders:
All stalkers out of the mansion.

01:20:11.172 --> 01:20:14.039
Let me go!

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:16.042
Ow!

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:18.044
- Eugene!
- Tucker!

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:21.013
I met Hef. He talked to me.
I think I had a breakthrough.

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:24.415
- How could you, you son of a bitch?
- What are you talking about?

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:27.181
You fucking brought me all the way
out here to your stupid party...

01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:29.382
- when you knew Cindi never left me.
- Eugene!

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:31.891
Wait. She was at the hospital
the whole time?

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:35.429
Don't play dumb with me!
She was paying for my medical bills.

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.521
How could you not know that?

01:20:37.632 --> 01:20:40.965
Mister's girlfriend not pay all this money
for you to use this as a porno room.

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:44.197
Juanita, I don't speak Spanish.
Ándale! Ándale!

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:46.831
The mister's girlfriend is on the phone.
You want to talk to her?

01:20:46.941 --> 01:20:48.465
Go away, Juanita.

01:20:48.576 --> 01:20:50.703
What an angel that young
Cindi Whitehall is...

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.780
for paying all this man's medical bills.

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:56.408
- I've never seen more devotion
in all my years of medicine.
- Go!

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:59.180
Juanita, I'm trying to do something.
Do you comprende?

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:00.811
No!

01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:03.152
You let me think Cindi had abandoned me!

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:06.716
But wait a minute. If Cindi was paying
your hospital bills this whole time...

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:08.762
then she obviously still loves you.

01:21:08.863 --> 01:21:09.921
- You should be excited.
- Tucker Cleigh!

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:13.125
Candace!

01:21:13.234 --> 01:21:16.397
And Candace's brother, Rick!

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.836
Put him down!

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:25.040
You are gonna die
for what you did to my sister.

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:27.944
- Yeah!
- Make it slow, Rick.

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:29.607
L-

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:33.449
There goes that
sissy-hitting motherfucker!

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:36.956
- Eugene. So we meet again, huh?
- Horsedick.

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:40.027
- Dot-MPEG! Dot-MPEG!
- Dot-MPEG.

01:21:40.128 --> 01:21:43.757
I was just telling my friends here,
if I ever saw your pretty little face again...

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:46.095
I was gonna rip it off and fuck it.

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:48.692
- No.
- And I don't lie to my friends.

01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:52.102
All right, men.
Les do this fireman-style.

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:54.903
Yeah!

01:21:57.645 --> 01:22:01.775
I shall now bathe my steel
in the blood of the offender.

01:22:01.883 --> 01:22:04.716
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:22:04.819 --> 01:22:09.017
Before you kill me,
let me just say one thing.

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:14.426
Candace, I know you're mad, and you have
every right to do whatever you want to me.

01:22:14.529 --> 01:22:17.396
But I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:20.366
See, I was just hangin'out with Hef...

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:22.993
and I realized something-

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:26.835
You're my busted girl from Kentucky.

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:30.570
We both hate the same music
and like getting wasted and stuff.

01:22:30.678 --> 01:22:33.374
And you like me despite all my faults.

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:36.348
So the least I can do is look past yours.

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:42.086
- My faults?
- Yeah. Candace, your face is a wreck.

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:45.489
- You stabbed me!
- Thas one of my faults.

01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:48.153
And you have this really stupid
hatred of strobe lights.

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:52.563
When you have epilepsy,
strobe lights trigger seizures.

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:54.999
See? Thas stupid.

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:57.003
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:59.938
The point I'm trying to make
is that none of that matters.

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:02.407
I like you anyway.

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:05.445
Look, I always hoped
when I met someone like you...

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:08.948
I'd already have this crazy,
impressive sexual history.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:11.712
But now I realize that
none of thas important...

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.378
once you find someone that you truly love.

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:15.388
And when I'm with you...

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:19.256
none of the other chicks that I've nailed
in the past matter anyway.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.385
Candace...

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:25.455
you're the last person
that I ever want to bang.

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:28.593
And if your weird brain thing makes you
bite my junk while you're blowing me...

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:31.866
then so be it.

01:23:31.973 --> 01:23:35.067
I'll never stab you again.

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.918
I love you, Tucker Cleigh.

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:50.717
Goddamn it!

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:53.157
I need to talk to Cindi.

01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:56.890
Well, that was real sweet.

01:23:56.998 --> 01:24:00.729
How you gonna get out of this, Eugene?
You gonna tell me you love me?

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:03.804
Horsedick, you gotta let me go.
I need to talk to Cindi.

01:24:03.905 --> 01:24:06.806
Why don't you write
a message for her on my dick...

01:24:06.908 --> 01:24:09.502
and I will make sure she gets it.

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:16.683
You know what, Phil?

01:24:16.784 --> 01:24:19.912
That kind of thing would have bothered me
before- that you had sex with Cindi-

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:23.787
but not now, 'cause I had
a relationship with her.

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.690
She's not just some trophy.
She's the total package.

01:24:26.794 --> 01:24:28.955
And a guy like you, Horsedick-

01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:31.497
You wouldn't even know
what to do with a girl like that.

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:34.124
- I'll say he wouldn't.
- Cindi.

01:24:34.235 --> 01:24:37.864
Cindi! Wh-Whas up, baby?
How you doin'?

01:24:37.972 --> 01:24:40.372
Horsedick wouldn't know what to do
with a blow-up doll.

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:44.070
- What? What is she talkin' about?
- Nothin'!

01:24:44.178 --> 01:24:46.146
Hey, les go back up
to the mansion, y'all.

01:24:46.247 --> 01:24:48.442
There's a D.J. He's supposed
to be cold-blooded. Come on.

01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:50.950
Horsedick doesn't have a dick.

01:24:51.052 --> 01:24:53.316
Bitch! You promised.

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:55.981
- What?
- Horsedick wasn't born with genitalia.

01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:58.354
He has to pee through a straw.

01:24:58.459 --> 01:25:00.723
This bitch has gone crazy.

01:25:00.828 --> 01:25:03.888
Hey, everybody go
to the Horsedick. MPEG party bus!

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:06.523
- Come on! Is a party!
- Wait a minute.

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:09.364
- What about all those girls you banged?
- Yeah, dog.

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:12.030
What about all them girls?

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:15.906
You know what? I've never actually seen
Horsedick make it with a ho.

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.978
Why you wanna see that?

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:21.981
Never thought I'd say this-
Fuck that! Let me see your penis, dog.

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:24.381
I ain't showin' you shit, man. All y'all-

01:25:24.485 --> 01:25:26.715
What you doin'?

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:37.992
It ain't my fault.
My mama was on acne medication.

01:25:38.099 --> 01:25:40.897
- Oh, man!
- Leave me alone!

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:48.007
Cindi. Cindi.

01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:50.907
Cindi. Listen, I'm sorry.

01:25:51.012 --> 01:25:53.776
And what happened in the past is the past.

01:25:53.881 --> 01:25:58.113
Whas important is right now. I wanna-
I wanna start over, if you'll have me.

01:25:58.219 --> 01:26:00.619
- I just think that-
- Aw.

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:05.588
Okay.

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:09.459
Okay. I just have a question. Why didn't
you call me when I woke up in the hospital?

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:13.591
I call the hospital every Monday.
When did you wake up?

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.999
On, uh, Wednesday.

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:20.131
- And you just immediately ran off?
- Yeah, I guess.

01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:22.072
Tucker's idea.

01:26:22.176 --> 01:26:24.804
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

01:26:24.912 --> 01:26:28.575
We've really gotta
get you some new friends.

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:37.385
No. This one's okay.

01:26:51.773 --> 01:26:53.673
Let 'em in.

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:58.135
Let 'em in, damn it.

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.817
- Mmm.
- I'll see you later.

01:27:07.922 --> 01:27:09.822
- Okay.
- Bye.

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:12.392
Bye. Bye.

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:20.490
- So, Candace, huh?
- Yeah. Isn't she the best?

01:27:20.601 --> 01:27:22.694
She's somethin' else, all right.

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:24.965
So you guys are like-You're good now?

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:27.200
Yeah. Candace thinks that we
should try to get pregnant.

01:27:27.308 --> 01:27:29.276
You know, really try to work things out.

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:31.641
Thas a great idea, Tucker.

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:35.147
That is a great idea. How are we gonna fight
if there's always a baby around?

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:39.481
And I'm gonna see if Hef can hook me up
with an internship at the photo department.

01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:41.680
- Hey, thas awesome.
- Yeah.

01:27:41.789 --> 01:27:43.814
So, what about you and Cindi?

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:47.520
I don't know, but, uh,
I feel really good about it.

01:27:47.628 --> 01:27:49.220
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:51.958
- Cool.
- You wanna know something crazy?

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:55.832
- You don't have a dick.
- No.

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:58.132
She's upstairs waiting for me right now.

01:27:58.239 --> 01:28:00.104
- No!
- Yep.

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.835
- No!
- Yep.

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:05.401
Your first time is going to be
with a Playboy Playmate...

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:07.777
at the Playboy Mansion?

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:09.816
- Yes.
- How do you feel?

01:28:09.917 --> 01:28:14.377
Um, I feel ready. I feel ready.

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:15.979
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:17.557
A toast.

01:28:17.658 --> 01:28:19.489
- To new beginnings.
- To new beginnings. Well put.

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:24.440
Oh!

01:28:24.542 --> 01:28:26.942
Whoo!

01:28:27.045 --> 01:28:28.979
You're probably gonna wanna
have another one, so you'll last longer.

01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.548
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:28:31.650 --> 01:28:34.813
All right, everybody,
I'm goin' upstairs...

01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:36.854
to have sex...

01:28:36.955 --> 01:28:39.116
with my girlfriend!

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.160
- Is it good?
- Oh, yeah, Eugene.

01:28:44.262 --> 01:28:46.196
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:46.298 --> 01:28:48.732
Thas good, 'cause
I'm tryin' really hard.

01:28:48.833 --> 01:28:50.858
Oh, you're doing
a really good job, Eugene.

01:28:50.969 --> 01:28:52.800
- Does it feel good?
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:52.904 --> 01:28:55.532
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.801
Eugene, be careful. Don't overexert yourself.

01:28:58.009 --> 01:29:00.477
#Give me some of your
sweetness, honey #

01:29:03.081 --> 01:29:05.549
#Give me some
of that sweet thing now #

01:29:07.352 --> 01:29:09.320
During my time in South Carolina...

01:29:09.421 --> 01:29:12.618
I discovered a groundbreaking
and new experimental way...

01:29:12.724 --> 01:29:15.693
of reinstating consciousness
to the comatose.

01:29:15.794 --> 01:29:18.695
It has proven itself
to be quite effective.

01:29:35.613 --> 01:29:38.912
Blue Team to I.C. U, please.

01:29:39.017 --> 01:29:42.180
I swear I saw this work once.

01:29:56.801 --> 01:29:59.269

01:32:40.098 --> 01:32:42.566
#Bet you hit the dirt when
they put that tip to you #

01:32:42.667 --> 01:32:45.568
#No lies
No more eatin'off them pies #

01:32:45.670 --> 01:32:48.798
#Seen you flyin'in the friendly skies
Have a safe trip #

01:32:48.907 --> 01:32:51.034
#Now I don't care
if you blue or you red #

01:32:51.142 --> 01:32:53.804
#Try to take mine
Either you do or you're dead #

01:32:53.912 --> 01:32:56.210
#'Cause you know I'm alive
doin'a few in the fed #

01:32:56.314 --> 01:32:58.373
#You can't take
whas in my head #

01:32:58.483 --> 01:33:00.542
#This is, homeys
is the art of war#

01:33:00.652 --> 01:33:02.882
#And I don't know
what you thinkin'#

01:33:02.987 --> 01:33:05.421
#But when you see
them lasers blinkin'#

01:33:05.523 --> 01:33:09.653
#Next thing is the preacher preaching
that he was a young man #

01:33:09.761 --> 01:33:13.288
#'Cause is the art of war
I gotta keep my enemies close #

01:33:13.398 --> 01:33:16.026
#And if you want my bread
then I'll give you the toast #

01:33:16.134 --> 01:33:19.035
#Save poppin'jags
while they taggin'your toes #

01:33:19.137 --> 01:33:21.469
#Thas a hurtin'plan ##
