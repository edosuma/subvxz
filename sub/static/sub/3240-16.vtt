20:11.077 --> 20:13.211
The fantasy
wasn't realistic enough?

20:13.213 --> 20:16.214
She had
her cellphone, and...

20:16.216 --> 20:19.383
I forbade any items
from sarah's regular life,

20:19.385 --> 20:21.552
And that threw me off.
Made you angry.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.421
She ruined your fantasy.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.655
So, you stabbed her,
didn't you?

20:24.657 --> 20:26.557
I think so. Yes.

Who created
some whack-a-doodle fantasy

Well, maybe it's time you
get yourself back out there.

You're saying that neville held
her down and watched her die?

23:46.459 --> 23:49.794
Yes. I suppose that was part
of his perverse fantasy.

23:49.796 --> 23:52.730
No, that doesn't make any sense,
not based on his profile.

24:03.609 --> 24:07.645
The only way you can really
understand someone's fantasy...

Is to inhabit it.

would he have left this stain?

remember spilling it.

But make him believe

You know, i don't get it.
Didn't he confess?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.176
However, in re-enacting

27:26.178 --> 27:27.945
Neville's fantasy
in the apartment,

27:27.947 --> 27:29.346
We discovered a clue

27:29.348 --> 27:31.448
That will shed new light
on his confession.

Well, you're the one who
suggested i ask her on a date.

with dinner and a movie, doc.

No, fear is
an underrated aphrodisiac.

27:47.199 --> 27:50.267
So, did the strategy pay...
Dividends?

27:52.605 --> 27:54.471
Afterwards...

27:54.473 --> 27:57.007
I brought her back to the lab,
and we ran a tox report

27:57.009 --> 27:58.876
Which proves that neville
was poisoned.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.679
Smooth! I bet that
buttered her muffin.

of 250 milligrams,

And when neville came to
with sarah's body before him

28:19.732 --> 28:21.532
And a fondue skewer
in his hand,

28:21.534 --> 28:24.702
His mind leapt to the grim,
logical conclusion.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.737
Lucas:
That he killed her?

28:26.739 --> 28:28.806
While someone else
snuck in

28:28.808 --> 28:31.008
While neville
was knocked out.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.509
And killed
his fake wife.

28:32.511 --> 28:34.545
Yeah, right, and left
the murder weapon in his hand.

28:34.547 --> 28:37.181
I don't know.
This sounds...
I agree.
It sounds farfetched.

to talk to neville again.

Recreational drugs?

Why?

28:59.772 --> 29:02.539
We recovered spilt bourbon
at the scene.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.174
It was laced
with a sedative.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.610
What sedative?

29:06.612 --> 29:08.846
Ketamine. It's an anesthetic,
but it can also be used --

29:08.848 --> 29:11.081
Recreationally.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.685
I know
what ketamine is.

29:14.687 --> 29:17.588
Did you catch that?
He...

29:19.358 --> 29:21.759
Of course you did.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.094
Would you be willing to subject
yourself to a blood test?

29:24.096 --> 29:26.463
Jo:
We may be able to prove

29:26.465 --> 29:28.665
That someone slipped ketamine
into your drink.

29:29.869 --> 29:33.537
But i already told you --
i did it.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.807
I killed sarah.

29:36.809 --> 29:39.443
<i>Mr. Neville, i'm not sure</i>
<i>you understand what i'm saying.</i>

29:39.445 --> 29:41.278
He knows what he's doing.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.147
He's covering for someone.

29:43.149 --> 29:46.383
Someone who framed him for
murder, destroyed his fantasy?

29:46.385 --> 29:48.919
Who could he possibly
be covering for?

29:48.921 --> 29:52.556
Another person whose life
was ruined when his wife died.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.892
Remember
neville's fantasy?

29:55.895 --> 29:59.797
The night when his wife told him
that she was pregnant.

born november 20, 1979.

30:03.435 --> 30:06.003
Nine months after the night
neville wanted to immortalize.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.305
No wonder he wanted to go
back in time. Check it out.

Daughter ran away from home
at 15, petty larceny charge.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.212
Two years ago,
she was arrested for possession.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.948
Ketamine.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.783
No wonder neville
took the blame.

30:19.785 --> 30:21.318
He was protecting
his daughter.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.319
Where is she now?

30:22.321 --> 30:23.921
Paroled last month.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.156
P.O.'s got her working
at a coffeehouse on 10th.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.525
Jo: Three days ago,

30:28.527 --> 30:31.929
A woman was murdered in an
apartment you used to live in.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.197
Okay.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.600
Sorry,
that's terrible.

30:36.602 --> 30:37.968
The same night,

Your father was drugged
in the same apartment.

30:41.507 --> 30:42.940
This is getting weird.

we'd like you to tell us

30:44.810 --> 30:47.211
About your relationship
with your father.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.513
There is none.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.849
Why?
Did something happen?

30:51.851 --> 30:53.450
My father
wasn't a bad person.
