00:03.504 --> 00:05.547
There's a lot of good things

00:03.504 --> 00:05.547
about weekends:

00:05.589 --> 00:08.049
no school, cartoons.

00:08.091 --> 00:10.427
But the best thing about

00:08.091 --> 00:10.427
weekends is having a neighbor

00:10.469 --> 00:13.472
like old Mrs. Jansen.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.019
(doorbell rings)

00:20.103 --> 00:21.480
ALL:

00:20.103 --> 00:21.480
Trick or treat!

00:21.522 --> 00:23.482
Oh, my! Look at

00:23.524 --> 00:26.067
what nice costumes

00:23.524 --> 00:26.067
you have!

00:26.109 --> 00:28.863
Here's two for you

00:28.904 --> 00:30.071
and two for you.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.740
There.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.283
ALL:

00:31.782 --> 00:33.283
Thank you, Mrs. Jansen.

00:33.325 --> 00:34.535
Good-bye.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.289
Hey, before

00:37.329 --> 00:39.289
you condemn us,

00:39.331 --> 00:41.166
we're the only kids

00:39.331 --> 00:41.166
who even talk to her.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.668
So if it wasn't for us,

00:42.710 --> 00:45.212
she would have no

00:42.710 --> 00:45.212
human contact at all.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.260
We shoveled

00:50.384 --> 00:52.260
your walkway.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.095
Oh!

00:54.137 --> 00:55.263
It looks wonderful.

00:55.305 --> 00:58.017
Let me get my purse.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.102
Okay, now you

00:58.058 --> 01:01.102
can condemn us.

It's Mom's birthday.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.562
She took us down

01:41.393 --> 01:43.562
to the store where she works

01:43.604 --> 01:45.188
so we could buy presents

01:43.604 --> 01:45.188
for her.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.775
So far, it's working

01:45.230 --> 01:47.775
out pretty well.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.652
Reese, for crying out loud!

01:50.694 --> 01:52.988
(grunts)

01:53.030 --> 01:55.407
It's killing me!

01:53.030 --> 01:55.407
I'm so close!

01:56.283 --> 01:58.159
Get your hand

01:56.283 --> 01:58.159
out of there!

01:58.201 --> 01:59.453
I can't!

02:01.204 --> 02:02.957
Ow!

02:02.998 --> 02:04.165
All right!

02:04.207 --> 02:05.166
I got it!

02:05.208 --> 02:06.961
Okay, now listen up.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.004
I'm going to give you

02:07.002 --> 02:09.004
each ten dollars

02:09.046 --> 02:10.213
to buy me something.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.173
We've never

02:10.255 --> 02:12.173
done this before.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.636
Usually on her birthday,

02:12.215 --> 02:15.636
we just make her stuff.

02:21.224 --> 02:26.229
Honey, it's... nice.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.522
It's a potato bank.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.275
I made it.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.029
Now, you can each

02:32.235 --> 02:34.029
get me something,

02:34.071 --> 02:35.572
or you can

02:34.071 --> 02:35.572
put your money together

02:35.614 --> 02:38.575
and get me...

02:35.614 --> 02:38.575
um, I don't know.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.036
Oh, well, now, look at that.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.204
A foot massager.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.373
Hey, and it's only $25.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.126
And you've got, uh, $30

02:47.167 --> 02:48.127
between you?

02:48.167 --> 02:49.878
Huh.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.213
Well, I'm sure whatever

02:49.920 --> 02:52.213
you get me, I'll love it.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.924
Now meet me back here

02:52.255 --> 02:53.924
in ten minutes...

02:53.966 --> 02:55.009
Stop pushing!

02:55.050 --> 02:57.302
Come on!

02:55.050 --> 02:57.302
Dewey, you...

03:00.097 --> 03:01.015
Lois!

03:01.056 --> 03:02.307
Hi, Craig.

03:02.349 --> 03:05.102
What are you doing here

03:02.349 --> 03:05.102
on your... day off?

03:05.144 --> 03:06.436
Oh, I just stopped in

03:05.144 --> 03:06.436
with the boys

03:06.478 --> 03:08.022
so they could buy me

03:06.478 --> 03:08.022
a birthday present.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.230
Oh!

03:09.272 --> 03:10.607
It's-it's your birthday?

03:10.649 --> 03:12.233
I'd-I'd completely forgotten.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.028
Seems like any

03:12.275 --> 03:14.028
other day, actually.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.612
Yeah, well...

03:15.654 --> 03:17.238
Craig to aisle seven.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.449
Of course, you can't

03:17.280 --> 03:19.449
blame me for forgetting.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.242
I've been so busy lately.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.537
Seems like I'm always hitting

03:21.284 --> 03:23.537
the weights at the gym,

03:23.578 --> 03:24.538
working on the guns.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.664
(laughs)

03:25.706 --> 03:27.248
Craig, aisle seven.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.250
Yeah, and when

03:27.290 --> 03:29.250
I'm not at the gym,

03:29.292 --> 03:31.712
I'm usually with

03:29.292 --> 03:31.712
my Dixieland jazz group.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.254
Really? What do you play?

03:33.296 --> 03:34.715
I'm the costumer.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.092
You know, there are four

03:34.756 --> 03:37.092
different types of straw hats,

03:37.134 --> 03:38.969
and if you ever need

03:37.134 --> 03:38.969
those arm garters...

03:39.011 --> 03:40.721
Craig, I can see you.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.222
Bye.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.437
FRANCIS:

03:48.187 --> 03:49.437
And it's my mom's birthday,

03:49.479 --> 03:51.523
so it means a lot to her

03:49.479 --> 03:51.523
for me to come home.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.274
Just as a coincidence,

03:53.316 --> 03:56.570
my friend Richie is throwing

03:53.316 --> 03:56.570
a huge party on the same day.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.279
But enough about me.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.907
I can't believe

03:58.321 --> 03:59.907
that you and your schoolmates

03:59.948 --> 04:01.533
have come all the way

03:59.948 --> 04:01.533
from Mozambique

04:01.575 --> 04:03.952
just to see a bunch

04:01.575 --> 04:03.952
of national parks and monuments.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.704
I mean, I don't

04:03.994 --> 04:05.704
want to criticize,

04:05.746 --> 04:07.497
but you really

04:05.746 --> 04:07.497
haven't seen America

04:07.539 --> 04:09.290
until you've seen

04:07.539 --> 04:09.290
the small towns,

04:09.332 --> 04:10.959
met the people,

04:11.001 --> 04:13.087
studied the way my friend

04:11.001 --> 04:13.087
Richie throws a keg party.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.295
You're wasting

04:13.128 --> 04:14.295
your time.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.297
She doesn't

04:14.337 --> 04:16.297
speak English.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.550
Oh.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.677
Which is just as

04:18.592 --> 04:20.677
well, because if she

04:20.719 --> 04:23.180
understood the crap

04:20.719 --> 04:23.180
you were feeding her,

04:23.222 --> 04:25.807
she'd laugh

04:23.222 --> 04:25.807
in your face.

04:25.849 --> 04:29.310
I, on the other hand,

04:25.849 --> 04:29.310
find your desperation charming.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.021
Really?

04:31.063 --> 04:33.273
Oh, well, there's plenty more

04:31.063 --> 04:33.273
where that came from.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.318
MALCOLM: Get out of my way!

04:34.649 --> 04:37.318
Let go of me!

04:37.360 --> 04:39.320
Come on, move, move!

04:39.362 --> 04:40.906
Here you go, Mom--

04:39.362 --> 04:40.906
happy birthday.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.116
Don't you want to wrap it?

04:42.157 --> 04:44.367
No, it's okay.

04:47.246 --> 04:50.165
An eyeglass repair kit.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.837
Box of

04:53.585 --> 04:55.837
throat lozenges.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.801
A dirt bike magazine.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.262
I might want to look at

05:00.842 --> 05:03.262
that when you're done.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.763
This cost you $30?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.056
No, it was, like, eight.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.225
This store's

05:06.098 --> 05:08.225
great, Mom.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.269
When can I have my candy?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.020
Relax, dude, we have

05:10.310 --> 05:12.020
20 bucks worth.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.272
Shotgun!

05:13.354 --> 05:14.355
Hey! Wait!

05:14.397 --> 05:16.650
(boys arguing)

05:22.405 --> 05:23.782
Mom, what's for dinner?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.075
Oh, I don't know.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.368
Why don't you have some candy.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.495
Yay!

05:37.087 --> 05:39.631
Dewey, take off the wrappers.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.841
Does Mom seem okay

05:39.673 --> 05:40.841
to you?

05:40.882 --> 05:42.176
What do you mean?

05:42.217 --> 05:43.384
I don't know.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.428
I think she might be upset

05:43.426 --> 05:45.428
about something.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.889
Maybe I should go ask if...

05:47.931 --> 05:50.433
Ooh. Skinny Fonzie.

05:52.019 --> 05:56.982
...19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.108
All here.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.693
You can go.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.912
This is my house.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.414
Can't you just feel

06:10.954 --> 06:13.414
the authenticity of it?

06:13.456 --> 06:15.416
Not like those crappy

06:13.456 --> 06:15.416
plastic national parks

06:15.458 --> 06:16.793
you've been going to.

06:16.835 --> 06:17.919
You can relax, Francis.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.296
I got off the bus already.

06:19.338 --> 06:20.421
Right, okay.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.049
Here's the deal:

06:20.463 --> 06:22.049
we go inside,

06:22.090 --> 06:24.425
make a polite appearance

06:22.090 --> 06:24.425
for my mother's birthday,

06:24.467 --> 06:25.802
have some cake with her,

06:24.467 --> 06:25.802
drop off my laundry,

06:25.844 --> 06:27.221
and then we go

06:25.844 --> 06:27.221
to the party.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.056
My God!

06:29.097 --> 06:30.015
What?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.432
Do you even know

06:31.474 --> 06:33.810
how astonishingly

06:31.474 --> 06:33.810
beautiful you are?

06:33.852 --> 06:34.936
Oh, yes.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.688
I've had 15 marriage proposals.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.149
That's why the general

06:36.730 --> 06:39.149
sent me on this trip--

06:39.191 --> 06:40.984
to keep me out of trouble.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.295
Hey, boys.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.295
Where's Mom?

07:00.337 --> 07:01.462
Bedroom.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.298
Oh, yeah?

07:06.218 --> 07:07.468
Honey?

07:07.510 --> 07:08.845
What?

07:08.887 --> 07:11.431
Are you okay?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.770
Hey.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.980
What's wrong?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.484
The boys.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.652
Ah.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.487
Don't let them get to you.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.950
They'll be out of the house

07:26.529 --> 07:29.950
in ten years.

07:29.991 --> 07:33.870
Hey, what did

07:29.991 --> 07:33.870
those mean boys do, huh?

07:33.912 --> 07:36.873
I gave them $30 to

07:33.912 --> 07:36.873
buy me something nice,

07:36.915 --> 07:40.752
and they spent it

07:36.915 --> 07:40.752
all on themselves.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.339
They don't even care

07:40.794 --> 07:44.339
that it's my birthday.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.011
Oh, well!

07:50.053 --> 07:52.472
Those boys are going to hear

07:50.053 --> 07:52.472
from me, let me tell you.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.727
They are going to get

07:53.974 --> 07:57.727
one heck of a talking-to.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.355
And th-then I think

07:57.769 --> 08:00.355
I'll go for a drive,

08:00.397 --> 08:03.775
I'm just so furious.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.573
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

08:10.615 --> 08:11.825
Her birthday's on the 12th.

08:11.866 --> 08:12.951
It can't be the... oh!

08:12.993 --> 08:14.577
No, no!

08:14.619 --> 08:16.246
I programmed this stupid watch

08:16.288 --> 08:17.538
to remind me that...

08:17.580 --> 08:19.540
("Happy Birthday to You"

08:17.580 --> 08:19.540
playing)

08:19.582 --> 08:21.876
No, no, no, no!

08:24.463 --> 08:26.756
You boys

08:24.463 --> 08:26.756
are in so much trouble!

08:26.798 --> 08:28.175
(whispering):

08:26.798 --> 08:28.175
Help me on this.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.384
(shouting):

08:28.216 --> 08:29.384
I can't believe

08:29.426 --> 08:30.760
that you could be

08:29.426 --> 08:30.760
so thoughtless!

08:30.802 --> 08:33.763
(whispering): We all

08:30.802 --> 08:33.763
screwed up really big this time.

08:33.805 --> 08:36.391
I have a good mind to use

08:33.805 --> 08:36.391
the belt on all three of you!

08:36.433 --> 08:37.558
Why are you yelling at us?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.019
Sorry isn't good enough, mister.

08:39.060 --> 08:42.439
(shouting):

08:39.060 --> 08:42.439
I forgot your mom's birthday!

08:42.481 --> 08:44.565
Oh... Oh!

08:44.607 --> 08:45.984
(groaning)

08:46.901 --> 08:48.487
(doorbell ringing)

08:48.528 --> 08:49.821
What?!

08:51.406 --> 08:53.533
What?!

08:54.493 --> 08:55.452
What?!

08:55.494 --> 08:56.577
Hi, Hal.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.246
Craig, what do you want?

08:58.288 --> 09:00.499
Well, Lois and I had

08:58.288 --> 09:00.499
an exchange, and I felt bad,

09:00.540 --> 09:02.459
so... I'm sure

09:00.540 --> 09:02.459
she told you all about it.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.044
No, actually,

09:02.501 --> 09:04.044
she didn't say anything.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.420
Craig, we're in the middle of...

09:05.462 --> 09:06.587
Well, it's complicated.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.424
You see,

09:06.629 --> 09:09.424
I didn't buy Lois a present,

09:09.466 --> 09:11.885
even though I wanted to,

09:09.466 --> 09:11.885
and I thought "this is silly,"

09:11.926 --> 09:16.056
so I went ahead and got her one,

09:11.926 --> 09:16.056
and here it is.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.977
Oh... great.

09:21.019 --> 09:24.814
I-I'll take it in

09:21.019 --> 09:24.814
to her right now.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.817
Oh, such a nice,

09:27.859 --> 09:29.486
nice gift.

09:29.528 --> 09:30.778
You know what,

09:29.528 --> 09:30.778
second thought, uh,

09:30.820 --> 09:32.613
I can take care

09:30.820 --> 09:32.613
of this tomorrow.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.115
I'll bring it in to work.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.115
Oh, no, wouldn't be

09:34.157 --> 09:35.658
any trouble at all.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.658
Really?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.994
(laughs) No, I'd be happy

09:35.700 --> 09:37.994
to take it in to her.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.330
Yeah, I'd really hate

09:38.036 --> 09:40.330
to put you out.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.289
Don't be silly.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.333
(both laugh)

09:47.670 --> 09:49.506
Give it!

09:49.548 --> 09:51.799
Lois, it's Craig!

09:49.548 --> 09:51.799
He's stealing your present!

09:51.841 --> 09:55.136
It's a present

09:51.841 --> 09:55.136
that I paid $129 for!

09:59.682 --> 10:01.893
Honey?

10:03.895 --> 10:05.688
Honey, where

10:03.895 --> 10:05.688
are you going?

10:05.730 --> 10:08.442
Wherever I want.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.277
Well...

10:10.318 --> 10:12.737
when are you

10:10.318 --> 10:12.737
coming home?

10:12.779 --> 10:14.322
When?

10:14.364 --> 10:17.617
Whenever somebody

10:14.364 --> 10:17.617
in this family gives a damn.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.882
Happy birthday, Mom!

10:38.346 --> 10:40.181
(grunting over TV)

10:42.350 --> 10:43.684
This is bad.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.728
Mom's never taken off

10:43.726 --> 10:45.728
on us like this before.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.855
Yeah. She usually

10:45.770 --> 10:47.855
throws  us  out.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.900
You bought candy?

10:50.942 --> 10:53.153
You don't just...!

10:53.194 --> 10:55.113
It was her...!

10:55.155 --> 10:57.907
If I only had the...!

10:57.949 --> 10:59.700
Stupid watch!

10:59.742 --> 11:01.620
Candy?!

11:01.661 --> 11:03.704
What were you...?!

11:05.748 --> 11:07.167
D'oh!

11:13.340 --> 11:14.341
(door slams)

11:14.382 --> 11:16.092
What's his problem?

11:16.134 --> 11:18.637
He's not the only one

11:16.134 --> 11:18.637
pissed at you little twerps.

11:18.677 --> 11:19.887
What are you

11:18.677 --> 11:19.887
talking about?

11:19.929 --> 11:21.722
I had this great

11:19.929 --> 11:21.722
party lined up

11:21.764 --> 11:23.099
with this beautiful girl,

11:23.141 --> 11:25.018
and all I had to do

11:23.141 --> 11:25.018
was come home,

11:25.059 --> 11:26.727
make an appearance

11:25.059 --> 11:26.727
at Mom's birthday--

11:26.769 --> 11:28.021
be the good son.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.523
Everything would've been fine,

11:29.564 --> 11:31.732
but now my trip home

11:29.564 --> 11:31.732
has been tainted.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.818
In her mind,

11:31.774 --> 11:33.818
we're all thoughtless jerks,

11:33.860 --> 11:35.612
thanks to you guys.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.447
What did we do?

11:35.654 --> 11:37.447
Think about it.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.740
Mom gave you money

11:37.489 --> 11:39.740
to buy her a present

11:39.782 --> 11:41.742
and you spent

11:39.782 --> 11:41.742
most of it on candy.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.161
And the rest

11:41.784 --> 11:43.161
on her presents.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.955
But you spent

11:43.203 --> 11:45.955
most of it on candy.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.374
We've established that.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.125
We're just going around

11:47.415 --> 11:49.125
in circles here.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.960
Okay, look.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.754
How would you feel

11:51.002 --> 11:53.754
if Mom didn't buy you a present?

11:53.796 --> 11:55.756
Mom's not buying me

11:53.796 --> 11:55.756
a birthday present?

11:55.798 --> 11:57.634
No, that's not what I'm saying.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.634
I'm saying...

11:57.676 --> 11:59.010
But it's my birthday.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.261
No, it's not.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.762
Francis, it's Mom.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.057
We've never made a big deal

12:01.804 --> 12:04.057
out of her birthday.

12:04.098 --> 12:07.686
And plus, she said she'd be

12:04.098 --> 12:07.686
happy with whatever we got her.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.728
And was she happy?

12:11.022 --> 12:13.983
Oh, man... we suck.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.152
Did we make Mom mad?

12:16.194 --> 12:17.778
No, Dewey, worse.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.781
You hurt her.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.243
Okay, I'm lost.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.619
Ow!

12:24.661 --> 12:27.414
That's how Mom feels

12:24.661 --> 12:27.414
on the inside.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.250
So what are we

12:28.331 --> 12:30.250
supposed to do?

12:30.291 --> 12:31.376
"We"?

12:31.418 --> 12:32.960
Haven't you guys been listening?

12:33.002 --> 12:35.255
You screwed up, not me.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.255
I'm not doing anything.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.425
I don't know what you're going

12:35.296 --> 12:38.425
to do, and I don't care.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.800
I have my own problems.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.637
I have to go to a kegger,

12:39.842 --> 12:42.637
party with my friends,

12:42.679 --> 12:46.224
make out with an African goddess

12:42.679 --> 12:46.224
with this hanging over my head.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.727
Come on, Amaani.

12:48.767 --> 12:49.810
This isn't fair.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.605
Mom never should

12:49.852 --> 12:51.605
have taken us

12:51.646 --> 12:53.231
to a store that

12:51.646 --> 12:53.231
sells candy.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.399
She set us up!

12:54.441 --> 12:56.067
Shut up, Reese.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.694
We blew it.

12:57.736 --> 13:00.530
We made our own mom

even have to ask?

If it's so obvious

17:43.229 --> 17:46.566
I need a little

17:43.229 --> 17:46.566
human consideration,

17:46.607 --> 17:49.193
I shouldn't even have to ask.

17:51.612 --> 17:56.034
Oh, geez, honey,

17:51.612 --> 17:56.034
that's never going to happen.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.785
What?

17:57.827 --> 17:59.787
We're not smart enough

17:57.827 --> 17:59.787
to do that.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.288
Look who you're talking to.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.124
You might as well

18:01.330 --> 18:04.124
ask us all to be a foot taller.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.378
Sweetie, you're always going

18:04.166 --> 18:07.378
to have to tell us what to do.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.630
I mean, look at this

half-baked celebration.

of our game here.

Honey, the only

18:11.799 --> 18:13.009
thing that

18:13.051 --> 18:14.218
we're ever going to be able

18:14.260 --> 18:18.347
to offer you

18:14.260 --> 18:18.347
is our total abject obedience.

I-I know

18:20.182 --> 18:22.351
that doesn't sound like much,

18:22.393 --> 18:24.520
but if you look at it this way,

18:24.562 --> 18:30.068
our meager abilities

18:24.562 --> 18:30.068
are yours completely-- 100%.
