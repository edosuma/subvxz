WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.081
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.160 --> 00:03.241
We need to talk.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.164
She's a suspect in
a double homicide

00:05.240 --> 00:07.242
and I'm having a bit
of a problem with this.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.045
I think you're gonna have to
tell him the truth, Nick.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.491
- You're the Grimm.
- What do you want?

00:10.760 --> 00:12.842
There are people
who find what you are

00:12.920 --> 00:14.888
and what you can
do very important.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.843
And, Theresa.
Tell no one.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.763
For your sake and theirs.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.410
In order for
you to help your friend,

00:20.480 --> 00:22.040
you need to know
what was in the potion.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.088
Here's the spell she used.
Can you reverse it?

00:24.360 --> 00:26.601
I need a place that's untainted
by another Hexenbiest.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.001
We could go
to the Spice Shop.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.242
Please,
get me out of here.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.250
It's a treacherous journey.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.291
You will need
your strength.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.446
Eat this. Oh, my
God, you have food.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.083
"Oh, remember that
you fashioned me from clay!

00:46.160 --> 00:49.130
"Will you then bring me down to dust?"

01:09.640 --> 01:10.721
This doesn't make sense.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.006
What doesn't make sense?

01:12.320 --> 01:13.560
How Adalind did this.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.243
For this to have worked,

01:16.320 --> 01:18.846
Adalind would've had to have
lost her powers at some point.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.481
Yeah, she did.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.008
Then that would explain the
Grimm's blood at work here.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.490
Actually, Nick's blood.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.483
That's how she
lost her powers.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.162
Even so, she would have had to
undergo the Contaminatio Ritualis

01:32.240 --> 01:33.480
while she was pregnant.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.686
With my grandchild.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.811
Which makes the child even more
valuable than I'd imagined.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.529
I should have given
Adalind more credit.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.331
This is going to take
much longer than I thought.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.284
Whoa!

01:53.360 --> 01:54.441
What the hell!

01:54.520 --> 01:55.567
Monroe!

01:56.000 --> 01:57.126
Someone threw a brick.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.361
It's not just a brick.

02:00.880 --> 02:01.881
What?

02:05.680 --> 02:06.886
A Wolfsangel.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.245
It's German.
It means "wolf trap."

02:09.320 --> 02:10.321
It's a warning.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.124
Is it because a Grimm
showed up at our wedding?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.201
Uh-uh.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.530
I think it's because
we got married.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.090
It's Mischehen.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.167
Some Wesen are against mixed marriages.
You must know that.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.447
Yes, but a brick
through the window?

02:25.640 --> 02:26.721
I'm calling Nick.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.120
If it's Wesen,
he can't help.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.720
If you're interested in your
friend ever being a Grimm again,

02:32.440 --> 02:34.280
let's board up the window
and get back to work.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.040
Wow, that smells great.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.246
In the kitchen.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.080
Well, I didn't think it was
coming from the bathroom.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.765
Ooh! A stir-fry.
Good idea.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.200
Yeah, it's ready
when you are.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.085
Wanna get Trubel?
Yeah, I'll get her.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.768
Trubel.

02:56.840 --> 02:57.921
Dinner.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.570
Nick! You better
get up here.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.480
Where is she?
She's gone.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.885
Her bag, everything.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.562
Did she say anything to you?
No. Anything to you?

03:19.440 --> 03:20.521
No.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.126
I can't believe this.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.726
No, Something must
have happened.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.840
She wouldn't have just left
without saying anything.

03:29.920 --> 03:30.967
Maybe she did.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.445
She wouldn't
have just left this.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.125
Ferula Tingitana.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.280
I got some in
the back room.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.323
Do you need anything else? Time.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.241
That would be next to the
parsley and sage, of course.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.169
No, the other kind.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.484
I should have known you'd...
Will you excuse me?

03:58.080 --> 04:00.367
Look, I just want
you to know

04:00.440 --> 04:02.647
that when all this is over,
however long it takes,

04:04.120 --> 04:05.690
we are going to
have our honeymoon.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.923
All right. Bed time.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.970
Lights out in ten.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.769
And I don't want to hear
that video game, mister.

04:25.840 --> 04:26.966
Okay, Mom.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.087
You can't be here, Keith.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.851
I want to see my family.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.690
You're drunk.
Sara.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.691
I wanna see my
boy and my wife.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.171
I'm not your wife anymore.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.645
You are my wife!

04:51.720 --> 04:53.484
It's over. Deal with it!

04:55.920 --> 04:57.888
Don't do this.
I'm calling the police.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.524
You can't take
away my family!

05:01.880 --> 05:02.881
Get out!

05:06.480 --> 05:07.481
Leave her alone!

05:07.800 --> 05:09.882
This is between
your mom and me.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.725
You go to your room!
No!

05:13.600 --> 05:15.125
I said, you go
to your room!

05:19.680 --> 05:21.205
You do this
to me, you know.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.370
You make me hurt you.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.562
I don't do this to you.
This is who you are.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.411
Go, David! Go!

05:35.920 --> 05:38.446
Go. Go, go, go.
It's okay. Good boy. Run.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.246
Get back here!

05:46.040 --> 05:47.371
Sara!
Ugh!

05:48.760 --> 05:50.046
Sara! Stop!

05:51.840 --> 05:55.242
If you don't come back,
I'll kill us all!

06:32.560 --> 06:33.607
Excuse me.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.245
I'm looking
for Sara Fisher.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.925
She was just admitted.
I'm her brother.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.208
Room 404, which
is right over there.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.408
But just so you know, visiting
hours are about to end.

06:41.480 --> 06:42.606
Thank you.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.721
Hey.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.241
That son of a bitch!

06:51.320 --> 06:52.321
Ben, don't.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.761
Did you call the police?

06:53.960 --> 06:56.167
I didn't have time, but the
doctors did once I got here.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.890
Oh, God, Sara.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.681
I'm sorry.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.040
How long are
they keeping you?

07:03.360 --> 07:05.089
Just overnight,
in case of concussion.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.640
If he ever
touches you again...

07:06.680 --> 07:07.841
Please.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.560
It's been a rough night.

07:10.840 --> 07:11.921
Okay?

07:18.560 --> 07:19.721
How you doing, David?

07:21.240 --> 07:22.401
Okay.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.206
What happened
to your wrist?

07:26.520 --> 07:27.851
He sprained it
when he fell.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.245
Did your stepdad
do that to you?

07:39.520 --> 07:41.488
Sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave,

07:41.560 --> 07:43.130
it's past visiting hours.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.406
It's okay.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.766
Never again, Sara.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.480
Thank God, she's here.

08:27.640 --> 08:28.687
Don't do that.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.560
I needed to make sure
you weren't followed.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.801
You don't think I
know what I'm doing?

08:32.039 --> 08:33.405
Yeah, you don't
know everything.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.841
That's why I'm here.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.446
I didn't tell
you something.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.446
Yeah, that you
were leaving.

08:41.720 --> 08:42.846
That's why I left
my black knight,

08:42.919 --> 08:44.081
so you'd know
I was here.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.241
I was trying to be safe.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.724
You know that FBI Agent,
I think her name's Chavez?

08:48.960 --> 08:50.121
She's Wesen.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.966
You saw her Woge?

08:52.120 --> 08:53.406
Yeah, when she
kidnapped me.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.930
What're you talking about?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.161
I wasn't supposed
to tell anybody.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.811
It was sort of like a
threat, against me and you.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.281
Which is why I'm here.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.642
Okay, why would
the FBI wanna kidnap you?

09:03.720 --> 09:05.563
No, she said it had
nothing to do with the FBI.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.285
There were
three guys with her,

09:07.440 --> 09:08.407
they grabbed me
off the street

09:08.480 --> 09:09.800
when I was riding
Juliette's bike,

09:09.920 --> 09:11.046
put a bag over my head,

09:11.120 --> 09:12.440
and took me to
some old warehouse.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.970
And then she Woged,
right in my face.

09:14.760 --> 09:16.360
She wanted to see if
I was a Grimm, Nick.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.646
Did she come
and see you?

09:18.880 --> 09:21.565
Yeah, she did.
She said it was just between

09:22.400 --> 09:23.481
the two of us.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.210
Why don't you tell me
about the young lady

09:26.280 --> 09:29.011
living in your house,
Theresa Rubel?

09:29.480 --> 09:31.323
She's awfully
handy with a machete.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.049
She was very
interested in you.

09:36.680 --> 09:37.681
What did you say to her?

09:37.800 --> 09:38.801
Nothing.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.408
But, Nick, she said
there were people

09:41.520 --> 09:43.682
that were very
interested in my services.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.329
Said that being
able to identify

09:46.480 --> 09:48.209
and destroy Wesen
influence in society

09:48.280 --> 09:50.408
was like a very valuable gift.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.649
She wanted me to be
a part of some group.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.491
And she told me
to think about it

09:54.600 --> 09:56.011
and not to tell
anyone, otherwise

09:57.000 --> 09:59.207
they'd, you know, have to
kill us or whatever.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.330
She didn't say
anything else about

10:02.440 --> 10:05.250
who this group was
or where they were?

10:05.560 --> 10:07.130
No, she just said she'd
be in contact with me.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.611
I was hoping you'd
know who they were.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.761
I have no idea.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.931
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.249
I was afraid they'd
hurt you and Juliette.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.563
I think you should come back home.
Nick...

10:18.680 --> 10:22.321
If they find out that
you just suddenly left,

10:23.360 --> 10:25.044
they might think
that you told me.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.564
You and I have to
remain very close,

10:27.640 --> 10:30.928
at least until we can
figure out who Chavez is

10:31.000 --> 10:33.048
and what it is
we're dealing with.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.240
Now, if she
contacts you again...

10:36.320 --> 10:38.891
Trust me, I'm telling you.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.081
Good.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.080
Look, all I'm saying
is that the Wolfsangel

10:44.160 --> 10:45.730
isn't necessarily
a symbol of hate.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.525
Like, in the 17th century,

10:47.600 --> 10:50.126
royal foresters used them, you
know, as a boundary marker.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.284
Royal foresters didn't throw a
brick through our window, Monroe!

10:53.360 --> 10:54.486
I know, I know.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.847
And to be fair, it was
unfortunately appropriated

10:56.920 --> 10:58.968
by an SS Panzer
Division in World War ll.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.691
But originally-originally,
a Wolfsangel was a trap,

11:02.080 --> 11:03.445
literally "wolf-hook."

11:03.520 --> 11:04.806
In fact, a lot of
Blutbaden perished as a...

11:04.920 --> 11:06.251
Okay, you're not helping.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.286
We're done.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.001
Done?
That's it?

11:10.080 --> 11:11.366
For tonight.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.244
It needs to garen lassen.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.681
What do you mean?
Like, ferment?

11:17.400 --> 11:18.481
In a way.

11:19.080 --> 11:22.050
I suggest you two go home
and get a little sleep.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.366
What about you?

11:26.440 --> 11:28.408
No. I won't be
done for a while.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.762
Um, yeah, sleep is good.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.280
Make yourself at home.

12:24.680 --> 12:31.086
Lord God of all the earth,
guide your hand...

12:33.440 --> 12:39.129
and cast your protection
upon the blood of my blood.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.206
Sara!

12:52.440 --> 12:54.204
Shut up, you damn dogs.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.281
What the hell?

13:26.760 --> 13:27.807
What do we got?

13:28.160 --> 13:29.446
Nothing but
fun and games.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.800
By that, I mean I don't know what
the hell we're dealing with.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.451
Victim's name
is Keith Harrow.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.041
Who found the body?

13:36.160 --> 13:37.241
That would be me.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.290
Woman who lives
here, Sara Fisher,

13:39.360 --> 13:41.089
was signed in at
Treeview Hospital last night.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.003
Hospital made
the domestic abuse call.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.891
Ms. Fisher has
a restraining order,

13:44.960 --> 13:46.644
which the vic didn't
pay much attention to.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.201
In retrospect,
he should have.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.040
Looks like there's something
coming out of every orifice.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.167
Clay, I think.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.562
My guess is Ultisol,
judging by the reddish color.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.770
Not exactly native
to northwest climates.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.084
I've heard of Russian mob guys pouring
cement down an informant's throat,

14:03.240 --> 14:04.526
but clay's a first.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.931
Where would
they get it all?

14:06.160 --> 14:07.650
Maybe they brought
a cement mixer.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.166
With a lot of clay in it.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.285
What's going on? Keith!

14:12.760 --> 14:14.842
Hey, sir!
You can't come out here.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.520
That's my brother! What happened?
Hey!

14:18.160 --> 14:19.161
We got it, Wu.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.524
What's your name?
Nate Harrow.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.246
Your brother's body was
discovered by one of our officers

14:24.320 --> 14:26.049
in response to
a domestic abuse call.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.124
My God, he's dead?
Yes.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.681
I don't believe it.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.807
This is an active
crime scene, sir.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.126
My brother was murdered?

14:32.280 --> 14:33.960
We won't know that
until after the autopsy.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.406
Was he shot, stabbed?

14:35.520 --> 14:36.885
What's that all over his body?
Who did this?

14:36.960 --> 14:40.043
Did you know your brother had a restraining
order against him being on this property?

14:40.120 --> 14:41.281
Where's Sara?

14:41.560 --> 14:43.244
Answer my question.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.320
Yeah, I knew.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.481
He tried calling
me last night,

14:46.560 --> 14:48.400
but I didn't get the
message till this morning.

14:48.960 --> 14:49.961
But I could tell
he was messed up.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.371
He said he was
coming over here.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.480
If anybody killed him,
it was Sara.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.600
His ex-wife?

14:54.640 --> 14:55.641
She hated him.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.401
Keith wasn't no saint, but he was
trying to get his life together.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.721
She either did this,
or hired somebody to.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.242
Sir, this officer's gonna
take down your information.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.960
We'll call you when we know more.
Come on.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.161
There's no way his
wife was strong enough

15:12.240 --> 15:14.004
to do that to him.
Unless she's Wesen.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.845
Yeah, what kind of Wesen would
use clay to kill somebody?

15:17.640 --> 15:19.005
I think we need
to talk to her.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.969
But the only way we're going to find
out if she's Wesen is to bring...

15:25.520 --> 15:26.885
Just in case.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.204
I'm not letting you go back to that
house unless he's behind bars.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.204
He never stays
in jail, Ben.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.246
Well, then you and David
will come live with me.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.560
He'd find me. You don't know what
happens when he gets like this.

15:42.920 --> 15:43.921
He changes.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.365
Yeah, into something evil.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.802
No, it's more than that.
Something happens to him.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.568
I can't explain it.
Maybe I'm just crazy.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.880
No, you're not.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.044
It's okay. This is not
your fault, Sara.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.361
Please.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.240
You just, you married
a monster, that's all.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.050
Sara Fisher?
Yeah.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.564
I'm Detective Burkhardt, this is
my partner, Detective Griffin.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.406
We've just come
from your home.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.960
Is this about Keith?

16:09.400 --> 16:10.401
Your name, sir?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.889
I'm Ben Fisher.
I'm Sara's brother.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.930
Did you arrest Keith?

16:15.600 --> 16:16.761
This your son?

16:17.360 --> 16:18.521
Yes, that's David.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.882
It's probably best if David
waits outside with Theresa

16:22.000 --> 16:23.600
while we speak with
you and your brother.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.046
Hey, David.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.802
David, can you go
outside with Theresa

16:30.920 --> 16:33.002
while your uncle and
I talk to these men?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.160
That's a pretty ugly-looking
bad guy you got there.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.200
You know, I've seen
a few like that.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.205
You have?
Sure.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.650
You want me to
tell you about 'em?

16:44.080 --> 16:45.241
Okay.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.446
Let's go in here.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.286
What happened?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.200
An officer went to
your house in response

16:59.240 --> 17:00.685
to the report of
domestic violence.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.926
He found your
husband's body.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.839
Keith's dead?

17:06.640 --> 17:07.686
I'm afraid he is.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.684
How did that happen?

17:09.960 --> 17:11.119
We're waiting
for the autopsy,

17:11.160 --> 17:13.162
but until we figure
out cause of death,

17:13.280 --> 17:15.281
we're investigating
as a possible homicide.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.085
Tell us what
happened last night.

17:22.319 --> 17:23.526
How'd you hurt your wrist?

17:24.760 --> 17:25.840
I fell.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.041
Does it hurt?

17:36.520 --> 17:38.045
Looks like
the bad guy's winning.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.520
He always does.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.120
Well, that doesn't
seem right.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.520
Why don't you let
the good guy win?

17:44.160 --> 17:45.286
Because he doesn't.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.325
Sounds like you've
seen the bad guy.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.286
Did he do that to you?

17:52.920 --> 17:54.604
Yeah.
Was it your dad?

17:55.160 --> 17:56.241
My stepdad.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.000
When he gets mad,
the monster comes out.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.291
You mean like maybe
there's a monster inside him?

18:08.600 --> 18:09.931
What did he look like?

18:11.040 --> 18:12.371
Real bad and scary.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.491
Hey, hey.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.608
You know,
when I was a kid,

18:16.680 --> 18:18.489
I saw some real
scary monsters, too.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.402
Some of them had big black
eyes, big yellow teeth.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.043
Others were really hairy,
and you know what?

18:27.280 --> 18:28.281
What?

18:29.200 --> 18:31.885
Some of them stunk so bad
I couldn't even breathe.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.121
Wow.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.284
Did they hurt you?

18:38.360 --> 18:39.521
They tried.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.040
What did you do?

18:42.960 --> 18:44.121
I fought back.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.446
Did you kill any of them?

18:46.200 --> 18:47.326
Eh, One or two.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.006
H ow?

18:50.480 --> 18:51.845
I guess by
believing I could.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.725
That scares
them, you know?

18:57.680 --> 18:59.648
I bet you could
scare some bad guys, too.

19:01.840 --> 19:02.841
Mmm-hmm.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.450
Yeah, a strong guy like you.
We're done.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.001
Bye, David.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.201
Bye, Theresa.

19:16.840 --> 19:17.921
Anything from Sara?

19:18.120 --> 19:19.121
No Woge.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.524
But David said when his stepdad
gets mad, he turns into a monster.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.644
So the stepdad's a Wesen.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.400
Yeah, too late to
figure out what kind.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.686
You think Sara knows?

19:27.760 --> 19:29.922
Not sure I know how to ask
that question right now.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.920
If she saw something, she
might just think she's crazy.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.126
I hear that.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.446
But if David's stepdad was
Wesen, what killed him?

20:10.200 --> 20:12.560
Hey, you ever wonder how many
Grimms there are in the world?

20:14.240 --> 20:15.446
Occasionally.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.480
However many there are,
there aren't enough.

20:20.080 --> 20:23.607
Well, I'm not finding anything
with clay as its M.O.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.803
Maybe what killed
him wasn't Wesen.

20:26.120 --> 20:29.966
Like a Volcanalis,
or that ghost lady.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.771
Whoa.Whoa.
Wait a minute.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.960
You're saying there's
more than just Wesen?

20:34.680 --> 20:36.250
Yeah, actually.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.563
Oh, great. Just when I was getting
a handle on this. Perfect.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.161
Detective Griffin.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.846
Mr. Fisher.

20:46.440 --> 20:47.601
Where are you?

20:49.880 --> 20:51.291
Okay, stay there.
We'll come over.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.685
That was Sara's
brother, Ben.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.246
He's interested
in confessing

20:56.320 --> 20:57.481
to the murder
of Keith Harrow.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.441
Mr. Fisher?

21:18.040 --> 21:19.166
Thank you for coming.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.129
Not every day someone
wants to confess.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.363
You killed Keith Harrow?
I did.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.891
Wanna tell us how?

21:28.360 --> 21:29.800
There's something
I need to show you.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.286
In my study.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.281
Please. This way.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.161
You're a rabbi?

21:37.480 --> 21:38.561
For ten years.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.322
I was a grad
student in linguistics.

21:41.480 --> 21:44.051
My thesis was translating
ancient kabbalistic texts.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.281
Eventually, I read
myself into a new calling.

21:48.960 --> 21:52.203
What I'm about to tell you will
be hard for you to understand,

21:54.160 --> 21:55.400
let alone believe.

21:57.480 --> 21:58.641
Try us.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.407
All right.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.168
In the 16th century,

22:06.240 --> 22:10.006
several rabbinical sources
recorded Rabbi Judah Loew,

22:10.720 --> 22:16.363
the Maharal of Prague, raising a
golem from clay using this scroll.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.204
A golem is Jewish
folklore, right?

22:19.400 --> 22:20.481
Exactly.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.011
It's an
anthropomorphic creature

22:22.080 --> 22:23.411
that's supposed to
protect its people

22:23.480 --> 22:26.086
from the Holy Roman
Emperor Rudolf ll.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.640
Only, it proved too
dangerous to wield.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.322
Now, the remains of the golem were
supposed to be kept in the attic

22:32.400 --> 22:35.449
of the Alt Neu Shul
in Prague, the synagogue,

22:36.920 --> 22:38.126
but...

22:47.920 --> 22:50.730
The remains were
reported missing in 1984,

22:51.760 --> 22:54.081
when a documentary film crew
went looking for it.

22:56.320 --> 23:00.689
Are you telling us that this jar
contained the remains of a golem?

23:01.400 --> 23:02.845
Well, I didn't
really think so.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.451
The rabbi before
me, Meisel,

23:04.520 --> 23:06.522
he brought it over with
several other artifacts,

23:06.600 --> 23:08.443
when he immigrated
from Moravia.

23:09.080 --> 23:12.482
I didn't think it would do
anything, but I was desperate.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.446
So I prayed.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.290
I prayed because
I was so angry.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.608
This man was
destroying my family.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.122
So you read that scroll and called
up a golem to kill Keith Harrow?

23:23.600 --> 23:24.601
I did.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.125
And you believe your
prayers were answered?

23:26.320 --> 23:27.481
I know they were.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.241
We appreciate you
wanting to confess,

23:29.320 --> 23:31.607
but we can't arrest you for
praying for someone to die.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.160
Yeah, but I'm
telling you the truth.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.401
And you don't believe me.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.684
Doesn't matter what we believe,
it's what we can prove.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.001
Praying isn't a crime.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.810
I'm telling you,
this is what happened.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.089
All right, we'll take the
jar and test the residue.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.164
If it's the same clay that killed
Keith Harrow, our lab will verify it.

23:48.680 --> 23:49.727
And if they do?

23:49.960 --> 23:51.200
We'll start believing.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.364
Residue from the jar matches
the clay at the crime scene.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.171
So we have a murder weapon.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.160
All we need is
a "How in the hell,"

24:10.200 --> 24:11.486
and we got this
one wrapped up.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.803
And how do we
arrest a golem?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.485
Or Ben praying for one.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.809
Can't wait to
explain that to the DA.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.450
Hey!

24:23.200 --> 24:24.201
Whoo!

24:25.600 --> 24:26.726
Thank you.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.482
All right.
Thank you. Please.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.246
Thank you.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.244
Well, you know,
lying in a hospital bed

24:36.360 --> 24:37.930
really gives a man
a chance to think.

24:39.240 --> 24:42.483
These past few years, this precinct
has basically been my home.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.688
And I just want
you all to know

24:44.760 --> 24:46.330
how grateful I am to each
and every one of you

24:46.400 --> 24:47.731
for all of your support.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.446
And it's great to be back.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.526
Sara, please.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.000
You really need
to hear me.

25:05.720 --> 25:09.486
Sara, when I left
you at the hospital,

25:09.920 --> 25:11.445
I went to
the temple and I prayed.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.647
I prayed for a golem.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.006
Stop it, Ben.
Listen to me.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.684
That is what
killed Keith.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.361
You have to believe me.
Ben,

25:17.440 --> 25:19.681
you didn't kill Keith,
and neither did a golem.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.606
I'm not looking for a reason,
and I'm not asking for one.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.010
Whatever happened
to him, he deserved.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.361
Sara.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.970
David, come on,
let's go inside, sweetie.

25:31.920 --> 25:32.967
David.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.326
We're good. All right.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.646
Nate, what are
you doing here?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.041
Somebody killed Keith,

25:40.120 --> 25:42.441
and I'm thinking you and your brother
had something to do with it.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.051
What? What? I don't give
a damn what you think.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.163
Hold on. Hey, you have to leave.
Now.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.721
You know what
happened to my brother

25:49.800 --> 25:50.881
that night,
don't you, Davey boy?

25:50.960 --> 25:51.927
No. I'm calling
the police...

25:56.320 --> 25:59.847
Be a good boy, and tell your Uncle
Nate who they've been talking to.

26:01.640 --> 26:02.801
Tell me!

26:03.800 --> 26:05.290
Stay away from him!

26:06.400 --> 26:09.563
Yeah. My brother-in-law is attacking us.
33 Evergreen, Kenton.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.362
When I find out how
you two killed my brother,

26:12.440 --> 26:13.646
I'm gonna rip you apart.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.410
You should've
told me, boy.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.684
I saw the monster.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.760
Don't let him get me!

26:22.920 --> 26:24.729
I saw him.
It's okay. It's okay.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.729
Don't let him get me.
I'm sorry.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.010
Sara Fisher, wife of your vic.
Yeah.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.447
Just reported somebody attacking
her at her house, units en route.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.601
Thank you.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.086
Come in.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.485
Good to have
you back, Captain.

26:59.560 --> 27:00.800
Thank you.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.450
Got a minute?
Sure.

27:08.320 --> 27:11.210
Have you had the chance to read
the report of when you got shot?

27:11.600 --> 27:12.601
Yeah, I did.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.406
And I especially want to thank
you for how you handled that.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.280
I'm not sure I
would've made it

27:17.400 --> 27:18.606
if you didn't get me
into that ambulance

27:18.680 --> 27:20.045
as quick as you did.

27:20.520 --> 27:21.885
Then you read
about Theresa Rubel?

27:22.240 --> 27:24.720
Yeah, the young
woman staying with Nick.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.404
Maybe I got this
all wrong, but...

27:34.720 --> 27:36.848
Surveillance
photo of a suspect

27:36.920 --> 27:39.924
in a double homicide Burkhardt and
Griffin were working a few weeks ago.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.527
Suspect was identified
as Theresa Rubel.

27:42.920 --> 27:45.400
Then later, Nick and Hank
brought her to a crime scene

27:45.480 --> 27:47.369
and introduced her as
a criminology student.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.880
And you think it
might be the same person?

27:51.640 --> 27:52.641
I do.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.206
I didn't want to
bring this to you,

27:55.280 --> 27:57.248
but I think Nick's protecting
her for some reason.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.366
Look, Captain, I don't like
going over anybody's head,

28:01.440 --> 28:03.408
and I have the greatest
respect for him,

28:05.440 --> 28:07.283
but I just...

28:08.760 --> 28:10.171
I can't figure this out.

28:11.720 --> 28:12.960
Let me see what
I can find out.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.041
Thank you, sir.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.361
What's the status?

28:28.440 --> 28:29.646
Suspect is the brother-in-law
of the victim,

28:29.720 --> 28:31.802
Sara Fisher. She's inside
with her brother and son.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.962
What about the suspect? Left
the scene before we got here.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.600
You want to tell
us what happened?

28:36.360 --> 28:38.280
Keith's brother, Nate,
was here when we got home.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.960
Yeah, he thinks we have something
to do with Keith's death.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.087
And he hit you?

28:42.160 --> 28:45.323
Yeah, that doesn't matter.
He threatened Sara and David.

28:45.760 --> 28:46.886
Do you know
where he lives?

28:46.960 --> 28:48.121
Off Germantown Road.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.526
All right. We're gonna
leave officers here

28:49.640 --> 28:51.120
until we make sure
that we've got him.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.327
Okay. Thank you.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.642
I should go with you
'cause it's very remote.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.090
Okay.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.720
Be out in a second.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.566
How you doing, David?

29:08.400 --> 29:09.686
He was mean.

29:10.360 --> 29:11.691
Like my stepdad.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.324
Well, I want you to know that
nobody should do that to you.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.526
Where's Theresa?

29:22.160 --> 29:23.321
She's at home.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.041
Can she come over?

29:27.840 --> 29:29.444
She sees
the monsters, too.

29:32.640 --> 29:33.721
I can give her a call.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.161
Thanks.

29:43.560 --> 29:48.646
AUSTRIA

29:51.920 --> 29:54.127
How much further?

29:54.280 --> 29:56.248
We gotta be at the top
of the castle by now.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.882
Don't wake them.

29:59.640 --> 30:00.721
There's nobody here.

30:01.320 --> 30:03.163
I'm here. I heard you.

30:03.640 --> 30:04.766
Now you've done it.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.005
No, don't go.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.490
I know where your baby is.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.369
What?
I know where she is.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.089
Where?
Don't listen to them!

30:19.760 --> 30:21.489
We must go now!

30:21.560 --> 30:23.562
Last chance! I know
where your baby is.

30:25.400 --> 30:26.401
Where?

30:26.480 --> 30:27.481
I know where
your baby is.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.160
Please, please just tell me
where she is!

30:31.760 --> 30:34.001
Where?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.684
Tell me where she is!

30:37.600 --> 30:39.090
- Shut up!
- Listen to me.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.410
I know where your baby is.
Listen to me.

30:41.480 --> 30:44.484
Stop! Stop! Stop!

30:47.080 --> 30:48.844
Please, just tell me
where she is!

30:57.840 --> 30:59.001
No, no!

30:59.560 --> 31:01.289
Stop crying! Stop!

31:01.920 --> 31:03.445
Stop! Stop!

31:04.960 --> 31:07.440
Stop! Please!

31:07.600 --> 31:09.090
Stop! Stop!

31:09.800 --> 31:11.370
Stop! Please, just stop!

31:12.200 --> 31:13.486
Stop!

31:17.080 --> 31:18.411
This can't be
happening now.

31:20.560 --> 31:21.561
No!

31:24.160 --> 31:26.447
No, no, no. No, no, no.

31:26.520 --> 31:27.681
You have to stop.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.726
Stop crying.

31:31.480 --> 31:32.641
You have to stop.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.530
Stop crying!

31:36.520 --> 31:38.170
Stop!

31:47.360 --> 31:48.486
Elizabeth?

31:49.920 --> 31:51.081
We're back!

31:54.720 --> 31:55.846
So am I.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.441
You need to leave.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.131
Really? Why?

32:04.640 --> 32:05.766
Didn't you miss me?

32:05.880 --> 32:07.041
Where's Elizabeth?

32:07.160 --> 32:08.366
Oh, she's long gone.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.001
Did you really think
she could undo what I did?

32:11.280 --> 32:13.089
Actually, no.
But maybe I can.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.361
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.201
It worked.

32:17.520 --> 32:20.205
Oh, Rosalee, you're taking
all the fun out of it.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.041
What fun?

32:22.560 --> 32:23.800
What are you
talking about?

32:24.040 --> 32:25.041
It's not Adalind,

32:26.280 --> 32:27.361
it's Elizabeth.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.168
I hope you don't mind me
borrowing your shirt,

32:30.760 --> 32:33.570
I just felt a little
sluttier as Adalind.

32:34.440 --> 32:35.771
Is that a terrible
thing to say

32:35.880 --> 32:37.320
about the mother
of my granddaughter?

32:37.800 --> 32:39.848
Oh, my God.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.090
No wonder Nick
fell for it.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.561
So, what, do you just
sleep with Nick now?

32:44.760 --> 32:46.603
You can't
possibly think it's

32:48.600 --> 32:49.761
that easy.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.281
Okay.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.404
That was
really unsettling.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.643
So, what, do you have
everything you need, now?

32:55.960 --> 32:57.200
No.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.408
We're missing the most
important ingredient.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.721
Then we'll get it.

33:00.840 --> 33:02.080
It's not up to you.

33:02.560 --> 33:03.607
Or me.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.360
Well, then who's it up to?

33:11.080 --> 33:12.081
No!

33:36.800 --> 33:37.926
Damn it!

33:43.040 --> 33:44.246
What the...

33:54.000 --> 33:55.126
Oh, man.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.410
Oh, my God. It's real.

34:08.840 --> 34:09.966
That's Nate.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.205
I don't believe it.
It killed Nate.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.561
Why did you call it back?

34:13.639 --> 34:14.641
I didn't.

34:14.920 --> 34:15.920
It just happened
to kill the guy

34:16.040 --> 34:17.041
after he
threatened your family?

34:17.120 --> 34:18.565
I was with Sara
and David.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.239
Well, you said you
prayed for this thing.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.241
Look, the golem, it's a
guardian, it's not a mercenary.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.288
I didn't pray for
it to kill someone.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.563
I just I prayed for
it to protect David.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.130
That's it, okay?
For how long?

34:29.880 --> 34:32.007
I wasn't specific.
I just prayed, that's it.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.880
So this thing's
just gonna keep killing

34:34.000 --> 34:35.639
anyone who threatens
David for any reason?

34:36.040 --> 34:37.360
As long as David
feels threatened.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.208
I'd hate to be the one
who scares him next.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.485
This kid's gonna
leave a trail of bodies

34:40.679 --> 34:41.920
with a guardian
angel like that.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.440
We better find this thing.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.811
And until we do, we have to pull
the police off of Sara's house.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.639
They could be in danger
if it shows up again.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.725
Well, if he does, you got a
prayer to get rid of it?

34:55.520 --> 34:56.726
I need the scroll.

35:01.800 --> 35:02.847
Thanks for coming.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.840
You must have made
quite an impression on him.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.361
Hey, David.

35:10.680 --> 35:11.920
Hi.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.764
Oh, no.
More monsters, huh?

35:18.880 --> 35:21.121
Well, we'll see what
we can do about that.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.441
In order to stop the golem,
I have to write a shem.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.887
Don't know what that is, but if
that's what it takes, write one.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.371
It means
the name of God.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.805
You have to put the shem
inside the golem's mouth.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.089
Unfortunately,
there's nothing in the text

35:36.160 --> 35:37.491
which will bring
the golem to me.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.808
We can't put an APB
out on a mud-slick.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.964
The golem is
David's protector,

35:44.040 --> 35:46.202
it should show up to destroy
whoever threatens him.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.726
You want
to threaten the kid?

35:47.920 --> 35:49.843
No, I don't want to, but
is there another choice?

35:50.200 --> 35:51.281
I'll do it.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.644
The golem is my
responsibility.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.685
No, you worry about stuffing
the shem into its mouth.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.561
Better come with me.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.890
Oh, Oh, Oh!

36:05.000 --> 36:06.411
You can't keep
moving him like that.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.610
Well, that's what the good guy's gotta
do, otherwise the monsters win.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.490
Huh? You gotta
tire 'em out.

36:12.200 --> 36:14.726
And then, when they
least expect it...

36:16.240 --> 36:17.890
Oh, you nail 'em.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.125
Hold on, I gotta take this, bud.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.241
Hey, Nick.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.442
Yeah, just sitting here
on the couch with David.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.361
Yeah?

36:32.400 --> 36:33.731
No way.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.766
Okay, I got it.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.604
The detectives
are coming back.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.200
What'd they say?

36:41.640 --> 36:43.640
They just want me to stay
here until they get back.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.086
You sure you
can handle this?

37:02.160 --> 37:04.401
I don't know, that kid's
been through a lot already.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.689
If he doesn't feel threatened,
it's going to be a no-show.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.921
It's my sister
I'm worried about.

37:08.040 --> 37:09.280
She doesn't
believe any of this.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.845
Then the less she knows,
the better.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.006
Let's do this.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.285
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.169
So did you arrest Nate?

37:29.320 --> 37:32.051
You don't have to worry about
Nate, he's taken care of.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.004
- Where's Ben?
- He's outside.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.964
We want to talk to David
about what happened.

37:38.240 --> 37:40.049
And I wanna talk with you.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.921
Okay.

37:43.480 --> 37:44.527
David.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.200
Your uncle's outside, and he
wants to talk to you, okay?

37:50.000 --> 37:51.126
Okay?

37:53.160 --> 37:54.446
It's okay,
I'll come with you.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.488
Hmm, Come on.

38:07.600 --> 38:09.204
Is he dead?
Yes.

38:10.720 --> 38:11.881
This is unbelievable.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.287
Hey, why don't you sit down,
and we can talk about it?

38:15.040 --> 38:16.087
Okay.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.201
Hi, Uncle Ben.

38:24.440 --> 38:25.566
Don't forget that.

38:34.240 --> 38:35.840
You know how much
I love you, right?

38:36.680 --> 38:38.284
Yeah.
Yeah.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.440
And you know I would never
do anything to hurt you.

38:43.680 --> 38:44.727
Yeah...

38:45.960 --> 38:47.246
I'm so sorry.

38:48.680 --> 38:49.966
But this has to happen.

38:50.760 --> 38:51.886
What do you mean?

38:59.320 --> 39:00.446
David.

39:04.880 --> 39:05.927
What's wrong with you?

39:06.600 --> 39:08.602
Why would you
lie to all of us?

39:14.280 --> 39:15.486
Listen to me.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.204
Now, I'm going to
have to arrest you

39:19.160 --> 39:20.286
and take you to jail.

39:20.520 --> 39:22.966
And you can't play
with toys in jail!

39:23.160 --> 39:24.491
Come on!
No!

39:25.440 --> 39:27.488
Uncle Ben!
Stop! It's not working.

39:27.560 --> 39:28.721
Don't.
Stop, don't!

39:29.160 --> 39:30.525
Here you go.
Thank you.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.928
Stop it! Let go!

39:33.040 --> 39:34.600
What the hell is he doing?
Please don't.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.445
- What is going on?
- Stop it!

39:37.400 --> 39:38.765
You're hurting me! You're
gonna have to trust us.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.126
No, that's my
son out there!

39:40.280 --> 39:42.123
- Let me go!
- Leave me alone!

39:43.680 --> 39:44.966
Why are you doing this?

39:45.080 --> 39:46.730
You can make all this stop.
Just tell me what you did.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.006
Nick!

39:50.640 --> 39:52.244
Oh, my God! David!

39:52.320 --> 39:53.606
The shem, do it now!

39:54.160 --> 39:55.650
No! Uncle Ben!

39:59.160 --> 40:00.400
Ben.
It didn't work.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.481
Ow!

40:08.640 --> 40:10.005
Theresa!

40:14.760 --> 40:15.807
I can't move!

40:17.240 --> 40:18.321
Don't hurt her!

40:21.840 --> 40:22.966
Get away from her!

40:23.080 --> 40:24.241
It's okay.

40:24.400 --> 40:25.561
Leave her alone!

40:25.800 --> 40:27.962
Get away from her! Stop it!

40:30.760 --> 40:32.364
Go away!

40:42.960 --> 40:44.007
David.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.281
You got him.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.601
I got him!

40:50.800 --> 40:51.881
I got him, Mom.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.164
I guess you did.
I got him!

40:54.280 --> 40:55.361
I got him!

40:55.520 --> 40:57.124
Anybody wanna tell me
what the hell just happened?

40:57.360 --> 40:58.441
I got him.

40:58.840 --> 40:59.921
I got him!

41:00.040 --> 41:01.121
Didn't I?

41:02.200 --> 41:04.043
That's the last time
lever yell at a kid.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.688
So the golem
was an answer to a prayer.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.571
A real badass prayer.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.524
It's kind of a big deal,
don't you think?

41:15.640 --> 41:18.644
Maybe somebody should be proclaiming
this from a mountaintop.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.286
Yeah, I've tried to proclaim a lot
of things, look where it got me.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.408
If David hadn't
turned on his protector,

41:23.480 --> 41:25.562
we wouldn't be having
this conversation right now.

41:25.640 --> 41:26.641
Hmm.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.081
I'll get it.

41:29.560 --> 41:30.600
Being a Grimm didn't help?

41:30.840 --> 41:32.524
Mmm. That thing
wasn't Wesen.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.361
Uh-oh.

41:37.440 --> 41:41.240
No, no, hear us out,
and then you can, "Uh-oh."

41:41.440 --> 41:44.091
We've identified exactly
what Adalind did to you.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.447
Yeah.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.768
We figured out a way for you
to get your Grimm back.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.762
It's a spell,
but a complicated one.

41:56.720 --> 41:57.960
How complicated?

41:58.480 --> 41:59.970
There is a key
ingredient missing.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.440
And you're not going
to like what it is.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.286
What is it?

42:05.720 --> 42:06.960
Her.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.046
What?
