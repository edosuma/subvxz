WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:02.616
Thanks for waiting,
Miss Pierce.

00:02.650 --> 00:04.217
Please, just call me Brittany.

00:04.252 --> 00:05.202
Brittany,

00:05.253 --> 00:07.370
this is Dr. Leonard Hauptman.

00:07.421 --> 00:09.289
I am Dr. Donald Langdon,

00:09.323 --> 00:12.125
the dean of the mathematics
department here at MIT.

00:12.159 --> 00:13.960
Brittany,

00:13.995 --> 00:16.463
when MIT heard about your
near-perfect SAT score,

00:16.497 --> 00:17.964
we were a little skeptical.

00:17.998 --> 00:19.299
A 0.2 grade point

00:19.333 --> 00:23.169
is practically unheard of.

00:23.204 --> 00:24.871
That means you've
never gotten higher

00:24.906 --> 00:25.906
than a D-minus.

00:25.940 --> 00:27.390
Is that why I had to take

00:27.441 --> 00:28.642
that math test this morning?

00:28.676 --> 00:33.012
We needed to see for ourselves

00:33.030 --> 00:35.232
if you were MIT material.

00:35.266 --> 00:36.233
And how did I do?

00:36.284 --> 00:37.567
You scored a zero.

00:37.618 --> 00:39.903
Brittany, you lack
a basic understanding

00:39.954 --> 00:41.755
of even the simplest arithmetic,

00:41.789 --> 00:43.406
and I don't know why
you couldn't have used

00:43.457 --> 00:45.024
a number-two pencil,
like we asked.

00:45.042 --> 00:47.661
Filling out the ovals in crayon

00:47.695 --> 00:49.212
broke our Scantron machine.

00:49.247 --> 00:51.164
I'm sorry.
However,

00:51.198 --> 00:56.336
we would like to ask you
about these numbers

00:56.370 --> 00:58.338
that you scribbled
on the back of your test.

00:58.372 --> 00:59.673
Yeah.

00:59.707 --> 01:01.007
I don't know.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.559
I didn't know any of the answers
on the test, so...

01:02.593 --> 01:05.227
I had all these numbers swirling
around in my head,

01:05.263 --> 01:07.397
so I just decided
to write them all down

01:07.431 --> 01:09.099
so my brain would stop
feeling so tickly.

01:11.552 --> 01:13.236
Jill.

01:15.606 --> 01:19.192
Brittany, this is no ordinary
series of numbers.

01:19.226 --> 01:21.528
When you start
in the upper left-hand corner

01:21.562 --> 01:23.079
and read it from left to right,

01:23.114 --> 01:24.080
it's a prime number.

01:24.115 --> 01:25.248
Okay.

01:25.283 --> 01:26.733
Normally you'd need
a supercomputer

01:26.751 --> 01:28.201
to find a prime number
that large.

01:28.235 --> 01:30.537
Totes.
But when you start

01:30.571 --> 01:32.622
from the upper right
and read it from right to left,

01:32.673 --> 01:34.457
you get Avogadro's constant.

01:34.508 --> 01:36.376
Sweet.
But that's not even

01:36.410 --> 01:37.544
the most amazing part.

01:37.578 --> 01:39.462
When you start
in the lower left-hand corner

01:39.513 --> 01:41.631
and read the number
counterclockwise,

01:41.682 --> 01:43.550
you get Planck's constant,

01:43.584 --> 01:45.769
which is the fundamental unit

01:45.803 --> 01:49.306
of measurement
in quantum mechanics.

01:49.357 --> 01:51.057
We-we don't even know
what it means.

01:51.091 --> 01:52.392
We believe

01:52.426 --> 01:55.562
that what we are now calling
the Brittany Code...

01:55.596 --> 01:56.563
The Brittany Code.

01:56.597 --> 01:57.614
...will go
down in history

01:57.648 --> 01:59.232
as the most important

01:59.266 --> 02:01.951
scientific breakthrough
of the 21st century.

02:01.986 --> 02:03.453
Oh, my God.

02:03.487 --> 02:04.788
That is...

02:04.822 --> 02:06.606
totally a-amazing.

02:06.624 --> 02:08.574
I thought you were gonna tell me
that I was an idiot,

02:08.609 --> 02:10.293
and that's bullying,
and I won't tolerate that.

02:14.799 --> 02:17.617
Brittany, it's possible
that you may be

02:17.635 --> 02:21.421
the most brilliant scientific
mind since Albert Einstein.

02:21.455 --> 02:23.006
No way.

02:23.057 --> 02:24.841
And that is why

02:24.892 --> 02:27.977
we here at MIT

02:28.012 --> 02:31.264
would like to present to you

02:31.298 --> 02:33.149
a very unusual proposition.

All right, guys.

03:01.545 --> 03:02.962
It's finally here.

03:02.996 --> 03:04.130
Regionals.

03:05.383 --> 03:06.800
Yeah!
That's right!

03:06.834 --> 03:08.184
I just found out,

03:08.219 --> 03:10.203
because of safety concerns
related to

03:10.237 --> 03:12.872
late-season tornados,
Indianapolis has declined

03:12.907 --> 03:13.973
to host the competition.

03:14.008 --> 03:15.959
So! As defending champions,

03:15.993 --> 03:17.627
we're having regionals here,

03:17.661 --> 03:18.628
in our auditorium.

03:18.662 --> 03:19.712
Did you hear that?
Yes!

03:19.747 --> 03:21.965
Home court advantage,
yo!

03:21.999 --> 03:24.084
Now, because of
a sexting scandal

03:24.118 --> 03:25.468
at Our Lady of Perpetual
Loneliness,

03:25.503 --> 03:27.637
their glee club,
the Nun-touchables,

03:27.671 --> 03:29.556
has been excommunicated
by the new pope.

03:29.590 --> 03:30.557
They've been replaced

03:30.591 --> 03:31.641
by the world-famous

03:31.675 --> 03:33.393
boys of Ziegler Prep,

03:33.427 --> 03:34.727
the Waffle-toots.

03:34.762 --> 03:36.646
Like cake farts?
They're very good.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.731
The Hoosierdaddies are still
the odds-on favorite.

03:38.766 --> 03:40.767
I mean, their lead vocalist,
Frida Romero,

03:40.801 --> 03:42.986
is a tiny juggernaut of talent.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.939
We are in for
the fight of our lives.

03:45.973 --> 03:48.908
So... let's get real.

03:48.943 --> 03:50.844
<i>There comes a moment</i>
<i>in every performer's life</i>

03:50.878 --> 03:52.529
<i>that defines him or her,</i>

03:52.580 --> 03:54.581
<i>sometimes for</i>
<i>the rest of their career.</i>

03:54.615 --> 03:56.416
This is our moment.

03:56.450 --> 03:58.751
We've struggled, we've endured,

03:58.786 --> 04:01.621
and now we must triumph.

04:01.655 --> 04:02.956
<i>And speaking of that,</i>

04:02.990 --> 04:05.175
<i>I want us all</i>
<i>to just take a moment</i>

04:05.209 --> 04:06.876
<i>to send some positive energy</i>

04:06.927 --> 04:08.261
<i>to one of our very own.</i>

04:08.295 --> 04:11.164
She has her final callback
for <i>Funny Girl</i> today.

04:13.217 --> 04:14.350
Rachel Berry.

04:14.385 --> 04:16.469
We're ready for you.

04:16.503 --> 04:18.771
<i>So, let's all give a big</i>
<i>round of applause to Rachel,</i>

04:18.805 --> 04:20.190
<i>wherever she is.</i>

04:22.893 --> 04:24.394
Hi, I'm Rachel Berry,

04:24.428 --> 04:26.696
and I'll be auditioning for
the role of Fanny Brice today,

04:26.730 --> 04:27.881
and I'll be singing.

04:27.915 --> 04:30.483

Thank you, Rachel.

07:12.730 --> 07:13.896
We'll let you know.

07:18.185 --> 07:19.869
You can only do this once,

07:19.903 --> 07:22.238
so it-it has to be perfect.

07:22.289 --> 07:23.706
It has to be,
you know, special.

07:23.741 --> 07:26.159
Are you actually talking
about a marriage proposal?

07:26.193 --> 07:28.161
Dude, we're in high school.

07:28.195 --> 07:29.495
You're not ready
to get married,

07:29.529 --> 07:30.630
and I'm not letting you.

07:30.664 --> 07:32.298
Well, I'm not asking
for your permission.

07:32.333 --> 07:33.666
I'm already gonna do it.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.802
What I'm asking for is your
help about how to do this.

07:35.836 --> 07:37.053
From my best friend.

07:37.087 --> 07:38.221
Okay.

07:38.255 --> 07:39.672
Then, as your best friend,
I need to remind you

07:39.706 --> 07:41.591
that just a few weeks ago,
you were totally confused.

07:41.642 --> 07:43.309
You didn't even know where
Kurt stood with this Adam guy.

07:43.344 --> 07:45.311
Well, I don't remember
you being

07:45.346 --> 07:47.847
this introspective when you were
asking Brittany to marry you.

07:47.881 --> 07:51.067
One, I don't even know
what that means, and two,

07:51.101 --> 07:52.268
we thought the world
was ending.

07:52.319 --> 07:53.736
And when we realized
it wasn't...

07:53.771 --> 07:54.904
I regretted it.

07:54.938 --> 07:56.189
Will you listen to yourself?

07:56.223 --> 07:58.241
You sound exactly like
the rest of the world,

07:58.275 --> 07:59.525
saying that
"it's not time yet."

07:59.559 --> 08:00.943
Well, you know what?

08:00.994 --> 08:02.412
People like me
have been hearing that

08:02.446 --> 08:04.247
for hundreds and
hundreds of years.

08:04.281 --> 08:05.581
This is happening.

08:05.616 --> 08:07.750
I am gonna ask Kurt
to marry me.

08:07.785 --> 08:10.253
And not only are you
one of my best friends,

08:10.287 --> 08:12.922
but I was kind of hoping
that you would be my best man.

08:12.956 --> 08:15.375
So let me know if you,
uh, change your mind.

08:18.128 --> 08:20.380
You know what? Someone has to do the
right thing here. Marley, stop...

08:20.414 --> 08:21.547
Jake...

08:21.581 --> 08:23.883
...six, seven, eight, nine...

08:23.917 --> 08:25.601
Uh, are, are Joe and Sugar here?

08:25.636 --> 08:28.271
Present, Mr. Shue.

08:28.305 --> 08:30.056
Come on.

08:30.090 --> 08:31.691
Sugar!
Great. Okay.

08:31.725 --> 08:34.227
Guys, I have finalized
our set list.

08:34.260 --> 08:36.279
We are going with "I Love It"
by Icona Pop...

08:36.313 --> 08:37.647
I love it!
Yes.

08:37.698 --> 08:39.448
"Hall of Fame" by The Script
and will. I.am.

08:40.734 --> 08:43.486
And Marley's original song
"All or Nothing."

08:45.322 --> 08:47.657
Hey, Mr. Shue, what
about <i>my</i> original song?

08:47.708 --> 08:48.658
Do you remember?

08:48.709 --> 08:50.243
♪ My cup, my cup

08:50.277 --> 08:51.711
♪ Sayin' "What's up?"

08:51.745 --> 08:53.129
♪ To my cup, my cup

08:53.163 --> 08:55.131
♪ More of a friend...
"My Cup" is one of a kind,

08:55.165 --> 08:56.549
but we're going
with Marley's song.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.301
Oh, come on, boo.

08:58.335 --> 08:59.469
Two thumbs down.

08:59.503 --> 09:01.304
The only way to polish
that turd of a song

09:01.338 --> 09:03.055
is with my angelic alto voice.
Whoa.

09:03.090 --> 09:06.142
So I demand to sing it
as a solo.

09:06.176 --> 09:09.896
And I demand to sing all
the good songs as solos.

09:09.930 --> 09:11.681
Everyone can snap their fingers

09:11.732 --> 09:13.015
and march around behind me.

09:13.066 --> 09:14.984
Tina, please make
an exact replica

09:15.018 --> 09:16.602
of Jennifer Lawrence's
Oscar dress.

09:16.636 --> 09:17.603
Um, no.

09:17.637 --> 09:18.938
Um... yes.

09:18.972 --> 09:20.273
Let me break it down.

09:20.307 --> 09:21.741
No one in this musty choir room

09:21.775 --> 09:24.327
compares to my megawatt
star power.

09:24.361 --> 09:26.162
Blaine, you're shorter
than your average lawn gnome.

09:26.196 --> 09:27.914
Joe, you look like
a Yucatán spider monkey.

09:27.948 --> 09:30.249
Tina is... you know,
she's... Tina.

09:30.284 --> 09:31.250
Wait, baby.
Baby, I love you,

09:31.285 --> 09:32.502
but you're really
out of line, here.

09:32.536 --> 09:33.669
And would you stop texting?

09:33.704 --> 09:34.954
I'm trying to talk to you,
it's really rude.

09:38.258 --> 09:39.759
Did you seriously
just break up with me?

09:39.793 --> 09:40.793
By a text?

09:40.827 --> 09:42.628
Yeah.
As fascinated as I am

09:42.662 --> 09:44.347
by your down-filled,
pillow-soft lips

09:44.381 --> 09:46.349
that are ten times
too big for your face,

09:46.383 --> 09:48.017
I really miss my sweet,
sweet lady kisses.

09:48.051 --> 09:49.852
Sorry/not sorry.

09:49.887 --> 09:52.138
Moving on, I repeat:

09:52.172 --> 09:54.023
I require all the solos.

09:54.057 --> 09:56.058
That's just the way
it's gonna be.

09:57.394 --> 09:58.644
Brittany, why are
you doing this?

09:58.678 --> 10:00.897
Well, I'm just living
your lesson, Mr. Shue.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.148
It's all or nothing.

10:02.182 --> 10:04.834
All or nothing!

10:08.431 --> 10:09.398
Come in!

10:11.934 --> 10:13.435
I said, come in.

10:15.038 --> 10:16.405
What the hell are you doing?

10:16.439 --> 10:18.707
I'm nailing my 95 theses
to the door.

10:18.742 --> 10:20.242
Your 95 what?

10:20.276 --> 10:22.544
They're 95 reasons
why I'm quitting the Cheerios!

10:22.579 --> 10:25.664
"Number one. It is true
that members of the Cheerios!

10:25.715 --> 10:27.416
"received illegal salaries
and kickbacks.

10:27.450 --> 10:30.252
"Last year alone,
I earned $5,000.

10:30.286 --> 10:32.504
Number two..."
I can read them myself

10:32.555 --> 10:34.006
without you reading them to me
like I'm some idiot.

10:34.057 --> 10:35.724
"Number three."

10:35.759 --> 10:38.394
Last year Sue Sylvester locked
seven Cheerios! In a...

10:38.428 --> 10:39.812
"dog crate in order
to potty-train them."

10:39.846 --> 10:41.563
What are you doing?

10:41.598 --> 10:43.732
I soaked my uniform
in lighter fluid overnight,

10:43.767 --> 10:46.485
and will now solemnize
my departure from the Cheerios!

10:46.519 --> 10:49.772
By lighting it on fire.

10:49.806 --> 10:51.240
Lord Jesus!

10:51.274 --> 10:53.692
This fool done tried
to set my hair on fire!

10:54.527 --> 10:56.912
Okay, guys, listen up.

10:56.946 --> 10:59.114
Uh, first up, we're gonna tackle Icona Pop.

10:59.148 --> 11:01.667
It's got a unique beat,
but not entire different from...

11:01.701 --> 11:03.168
All right, look.
I'm-I'm sorry.

11:03.203 --> 11:04.753
Excuse me, Mr. Shue,
but I've got to say something.

11:04.788 --> 11:05.587
Okay.

11:08.708 --> 11:10.843
Look, so I hate
to pull a Brittany here,

11:10.877 --> 11:13.095
but the bottom line is,
I'm not performing in regionals

11:13.129 --> 11:15.097
until Catfish reveals
themselves.

11:15.131 --> 11:17.800
This whole situation is out
of hand and needs to end.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.519
Hey, look, I'm serious, okay?

11:20.553 --> 11:23.439
I can't take it anymore,
it-it's tearing me apart.

11:23.473 --> 11:26.025
And someone in this room
is playing games with me,

11:26.059 --> 11:28.027
and I want to know who!

11:28.061 --> 11:29.895
Somebody, just say who it is.
I don't think it's any of us.

11:29.946 --> 11:32.481
Pull out your phones! Everybody
pull out your phones right now!

11:32.515 --> 11:33.732
Ryder, relax, man.
Dude.

11:33.783 --> 11:35.234
I know this is upsetting, but...

11:35.285 --> 11:36.535
Well, now nobody
is going to admit it

11:36.569 --> 11:38.570
for fear of being murdered.

11:38.621 --> 11:40.072
I've told this person
everything,

11:40.123 --> 11:42.291
and I want to know who it is.

11:42.325 --> 11:44.460
I know you're upset... I want to know...
No, you don't know.

11:44.494 --> 11:46.245
You don't know, okay? Who is it?

11:46.296 --> 11:47.329
It's not me.

11:47.363 --> 11:49.298
All right, fine.
If nobody's gonna say anything,

11:49.332 --> 11:51.500
pull out your phones. And I want
to see all of your phones.

11:51.534 --> 11:53.469
Are you serious?
All of your phones.

11:53.503 --> 11:56.221
Pull out your texts. I'm serious!
Texts!

11:56.256 --> 11:57.923
Whoever it is, just say it.

11:57.974 --> 12:00.041
Who is it?
It's me.

12:01.210 --> 12:02.311
I'm Catfish.

12:09.936 --> 12:11.987
What? What do you...?

12:12.021 --> 12:14.773
No, I-I-I asked you.
You swore to me.

12:14.808 --> 12:16.241
I'm sorry.

12:16.276 --> 12:19.194
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

12:19.228 --> 12:21.363
Look, just take it easy,
Ryder, okay?

12:21.397 --> 12:22.998
This was just a little joke.

12:23.032 --> 12:24.500
Things got out of hand.

12:26.402 --> 12:29.588
What, you're-you're
defending her?

12:29.622 --> 12:31.340
Huh? Are you kidding me?

12:34.076 --> 12:36.578
What's wrong with you people?

12:37.680 --> 12:39.681
Ryder...

12:44.020 --> 12:47.222
Marley, that's messed up.

12:47.256 --> 12:49.691
Well, if you were asking me
to marry you,

12:49.726 --> 12:51.393
I'd want that big one.

12:51.427 --> 12:53.112
My fingers are on
the larger side,

12:53.146 --> 12:55.063
and you have to figure,
with my build,

12:55.097 --> 12:56.732
after we have a few babies,

12:56.766 --> 12:59.451
I may put on
a couple of pounds.

12:59.486 --> 13:01.153
Tina, I'm looking
for a ring for Kurt.

13:01.204 --> 13:03.822
He is so lucky.

13:03.873 --> 13:06.291
Those are engagement rings.

13:06.326 --> 13:08.994
That's good because I'm looking
to get engaged.

13:09.045 --> 13:10.245
I am constantly

13:10.279 --> 13:12.998
telling my nieces
and nephews to wear condoms.

13:13.049 --> 13:14.917
It's for my boyfriend.
I'm not pregnant.

13:14.951 --> 13:16.001
He used to be

13:16.052 --> 13:17.503
my boyfriend. It was...
the whole thing,

13:17.554 --> 13:19.304
it's very complicated.
I won't get into it.

13:19.339 --> 13:20.639
But basically,
I love him very much,

13:20.673 --> 13:23.142
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with him,

13:23.176 --> 13:25.177
so I'm going to ask
him to marry me.

13:25.228 --> 13:26.929
Tell me about your man.

13:26.963 --> 13:30.015
Really?

13:30.066 --> 13:32.684
Is he your soul mate?

13:32.735 --> 13:34.937
Yes, he is.

13:40.610 --> 13:43.111
I met Liz when we were 18.

13:43.145 --> 13:45.280
It was at a Styx concert

13:45.314 --> 13:47.366
back when they were doing
hard rock,

13:47.417 --> 13:50.252
not this weird robot stuff.

13:50.286 --> 13:53.088
We've been together ever since.

13:53.122 --> 13:56.341
Doesn't matter
how young or old you are.

13:56.376 --> 13:58.293
True love is true love.

13:58.327 --> 14:01.630
My friends have been
giving me so much flak.

14:01.664 --> 14:04.766
If we all had listened,
we wouldn't be moments away

14:04.801 --> 14:07.886
from the Supreme Court
finally telling us

14:07.937 --> 14:11.390
that we are just as crazy
and awesome as everybody else.

14:11.441 --> 14:12.941
Hey, dude.

14:12.976 --> 14:14.776
Don't try to stop me.
I'm doing this, okay?

14:14.811 --> 14:16.862
I love you and I want to support
you, so if you're really

14:16.896 --> 14:18.647
gonna do this, I'm helping
you pick out the ring.

14:18.681 --> 14:20.649
I have, like, the best taste.
Is this him?

14:20.683 --> 14:21.950
No. Oh, no.
No.

14:21.985 --> 14:24.052
I mean, he wants to do me,
but we're just friends.

14:24.086 --> 14:26.054
Sam.
Jan.

14:26.088 --> 14:28.557
Would you excuse us
for just a moment?

14:28.591 --> 14:29.558
Yeah, sure.

14:29.592 --> 14:31.092
I don't.

14:31.110 --> 14:33.094
You <i>do</i> want to do me.

14:34.948 --> 14:36.398
Forgive me for being pushy,

14:36.432 --> 14:39.735
but do you have anyone
to advise you on this?

14:39.769 --> 14:41.954
Someone who would
really understand?

14:41.988 --> 14:44.573
Someone... gay?

14:44.607 --> 14:46.241
Yeah.
Not really.

14:46.275 --> 14:49.244
I just want you guys
to see what's possible

14:49.278 --> 14:51.179
when two people
really love each other.

14:51.214 --> 14:53.916
Sound good?

15:01.674 --> 15:03.124
Brittany, have a seat.

15:03.142 --> 15:04.509
We need to chat.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.795
I thought you were teaching
aerobics to fat soccer moms.

15:06.813 --> 15:08.764
Oh, I just stopped
by the teachers' lounge

15:08.798 --> 15:11.033
to retrieve my baby's
placenta in the fridge.

15:11.801 --> 15:13.485
Brittany, Sue and I are

15:13.519 --> 15:14.937
very worried about you.

15:14.971 --> 15:16.939
And we need to know
what's going on.

15:16.973 --> 15:20.025
I refuse to speak to either of
you in this office. It's dusty

15:20.076 --> 15:21.977
and drab and Mr. Shue's
"Teacher of The Year"

15:21.995 --> 15:23.862
picture really creeps me out.
So there's

15:23.913 --> 15:25.313
only one place that I'll talk:

15:25.331 --> 15:29.150
My turf, my rules, my <i>Fondue.</i>

15:29.168 --> 15:31.119
♪ Fondue for two! ♪
♪ Hey!

15:31.154 --> 15:33.538
♪ Fondue for two!
♪ That's some hot dish!

15:33.589 --> 15:35.540
♪ Fondue for two!

15:35.591 --> 15:37.659
Welcome back to <i>Fondue for Two.</i>

15:37.677 --> 15:40.345
Tonight's guests are two sworn
enemies who became friends,

15:40.380 --> 15:43.215
then became enemies again,
then became friends again,

15:43.266 --> 15:46.001
then enemies, and then
everybody stopped caring.

15:46.019 --> 15:48.003
Sue Sylvester
and Will Schuester.

15:48.021 --> 15:49.671
It's great to be here.
Yeah.

15:49.689 --> 15:50.856
Oh, my goodness,

15:50.890 --> 15:52.841
this fondue smells disgusting.

15:52.859 --> 15:54.860
It's like somebody poured
chardonnay on a homeless woman

15:54.894 --> 15:56.028
who'd been dead several days.

15:56.062 --> 15:57.145
Yeah, fantastic.

15:57.179 --> 15:59.815
So, Mr. Shue, is it true
that you and Emma

15:59.849 --> 16:00.983
are finally getting married?

16:01.017 --> 16:02.200
Yeah, it looks like it.

16:02.235 --> 16:04.185
Awesome. Do you plan
on having children,

16:04.203 --> 16:06.321
or just continue to have
weirdly intimate relationships

16:06.355 --> 16:07.990
with high school students
instead of children?

16:08.024 --> 16:09.408
No, we'd like to have kids.

16:09.459 --> 16:11.376
Speaking of kids,
Sue Sylvester,

16:11.411 --> 16:14.913
what if I were to tell you
that I know the true identity

16:14.964 --> 16:16.081
of your baby's
celebrity father?

16:16.132 --> 16:18.083
I would say that's highly unlikely.
What if I were

16:18.134 --> 16:20.736
to tell you that I know for a
fact that it's Michael Bolton?

16:20.770 --> 16:23.655
I would say that you have
no proof.

16:23.690 --> 16:27.943
Well, Michael Bolton played in
a concert in Columbus, Ohio

16:27.977 --> 16:30.445
nine months to the day before
your daughter was born.

16:30.479 --> 16:33.165
Also, Robin's birth certificate
says she was born in.

16:33.199 --> 16:36.118
"Ol' Milton Beach," which is
an anagram for "Michael Bolton."

16:36.152 --> 16:39.621
Also, Michael Bolton has a new
album out, and track number one

16:39.655 --> 16:43.675
is called "So Proud to Be
Your Father, Robin Sylvester."

16:43.710 --> 16:46.011
Michael Bolton and I met in 1994
in Los Angeles

16:46.045 --> 16:48.130
when I punctured his windpipe
with a letter opener

16:48.164 --> 16:51.350
at Kate Mantilini's where
he was having lunch and

16:51.384 --> 16:53.435
I just happened
to be doing my taxes.

16:53.469 --> 16:56.271
He choked after inhaling in
a chunk of his own hair,

16:56.305 --> 16:59.057
and I saved his life.
He's owed me a favor ever since.

16:59.108 --> 17:01.610
And just in case
you're wondering,

17:01.644 --> 17:04.061
Michael Bolton
is a fantastic lover.

17:04.113 --> 17:06.114
Wow. We did it all night, Will.

17:06.148 --> 17:07.866
We did it every which way.

17:07.900 --> 17:09.401
Cool.

17:11.570 --> 17:13.121
Pick up.

17:14.290 --> 17:16.290
I'm sorry, did,
uh, hell just freeze over

17:16.325 --> 17:18.877
or did you just White Chocolate
butt-dial me?

17:18.911 --> 17:20.212
Hey, look,
I need to talk to you.

17:20.246 --> 17:22.748
Sorry, no can do, Trouts,
I just got back

17:22.799 --> 17:25.550
from a dance class and
I'm already five minutes late

17:25.585 --> 17:28.420
for drinks with this insanely
hot off-Broadway <i>choreographer.</i>

17:28.471 --> 17:30.055
It's about Brittany.
Obviously.

17:30.089 --> 17:31.807
Okay, she broke up with me.
Inevitably.

17:31.841 --> 17:33.675
Okay, look, she's been acting
really weird since she met with

17:33.709 --> 17:35.594
those people at MIT, okay? She
even dropped out of regionals.

17:35.645 --> 17:37.229
Okay, and are we sure

17:37.263 --> 17:39.815
it's not just Britney 3.0 Week
in Glee Club?

17:39.849 --> 17:41.566
Look, okay, I know I'm not
your favorite person,

17:41.601 --> 17:43.151
but you also know
that I'd help you

17:43.186 --> 17:46.488
if you ever asked me to.

17:46.522 --> 17:51.109
Something, something's wrong.
I'm asking you for help.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.279
It was love at first sticks,

17:55.306 --> 17:57.808
that's what we always say.

17:57.842 --> 18:00.427
Well, the irony was that we met
at the concert, you know.

18:00.478 --> 18:03.597
We grew up in the same town just a
few blocks from each other. Wow.

18:03.648 --> 18:05.816
We went to the same high school.
You guys are

18:05.850 --> 18:07.184
like a Nora Ephron movie.
Exactly.

18:07.218 --> 18:08.685
Did you go to prom together?

18:08.719 --> 18:09.987
No.
Yeah, well...

18:10.021 --> 18:11.888
Well, we went together
as a group.

18:11.906 --> 18:13.440
We took boys, of course.

18:13.491 --> 18:15.058
Merle and Tommy,
those poor fools.

18:15.076 --> 18:17.494
Merle and Tom. They had no
idea what was going on.

18:17.529 --> 18:21.231
It was different times then,
you know.

18:21.249 --> 18:23.733
There were, there were
no gay clubs at school.

18:23.752 --> 18:27.538
You know, nobody talked about
it. We had no representation.

18:27.572 --> 18:30.073
But somehow
we always found a way.

18:30.091 --> 18:32.960
That summer we went on a bus
tour of the United States.

18:33.011 --> 18:35.212
We saw all the sights.

18:35.246 --> 18:38.348
And in the end we decided
we liked Ohio the best.

18:38.383 --> 18:42.970
Yeah, yeah, came back,
moved in together,

18:43.021 --> 18:46.390
got each other through college,
and we broke up twice,

18:46.424 --> 18:48.475
and got back
together again twice.

18:48.526 --> 18:50.227
And then we bought
the house in Lima.

18:50.261 --> 18:52.362
What haven't
we seen from our porch?

18:52.397 --> 18:53.864
Nothing.
Hmm.

18:53.898 --> 18:55.265
AIDS.
Yeah.

18:55.283 --> 18:57.067
Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

18:57.101 --> 18:59.036
<i>Ellen.</i>

18:59.070 --> 19:02.156
We've seen it all
side-by-side.

19:02.207 --> 19:05.659
Remember when we couldn't even
do this in public, hold hands?

19:05.710 --> 19:07.161
Oh, yeah.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.445
You guys are so sweet.

19:08.463 --> 19:11.165
But you know, when I asked you
"How did you guys meet?"

19:11.216 --> 19:13.250
I actually meant,
"How did you meet Blaine?"

19:13.284 --> 19:14.751
Oh! At the mall.

19:14.785 --> 19:16.620
I was clothes shopping with Tina

19:16.638 --> 19:19.756
and we were at the food court
at Sbarro,

19:19.790 --> 19:22.009
and Jan and I just got
to talking.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.927
And I said,
"Why don't we continue this

19:23.961 --> 19:26.296
over dinner at Breadstix?"
We've been coming here 20 years.

19:26.314 --> 19:27.397
Thirty.

19:27.432 --> 19:28.599
30 years? 30. Wow.

19:28.633 --> 19:31.018
We camped out
for the grand opening.

19:31.069 --> 19:32.569
Yes, we did.

19:32.604 --> 19:34.188
Well, I'm glad
you recommended it, Jan.

19:34.239 --> 19:36.440
I mean, it's great and really
inspiring to hear your story.

19:36.474 --> 19:39.142
You know, I know I don't, and we
don't really have too many

19:39.160 --> 19:41.311
gay and lesbian role models
to look up to, so...

19:41.329 --> 19:43.447
You guys are a sweet couple.

19:43.481 --> 19:45.866
Thank you.
Oh, we're not a couple.

19:45.917 --> 19:49.036
Would you have married me
if I had asked you?

19:49.087 --> 19:50.787
I mean, if we were allowed to?

19:50.821 --> 19:51.821
I always said yeah,

19:51.840 --> 19:53.757
as soon as it's legal in Ohio.

19:53.791 --> 19:54.824
It will be.
Yeah.

19:54.843 --> 19:56.543
Eventually.

19:56.594 --> 20:00.664
But in the meantime, there are still
plenty of places where it's legal.

20:00.682 --> 20:05.636
And so, Elizabeth
Margaret Stevens...

20:07.171 --> 20:09.389
...will you legally marry me?

20:09.440 --> 20:11.275
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, oh!

20:11.309 --> 20:13.610
Oh, honey, yes.

20:23.655 --> 20:25.188
Hey, can we talk?

20:25.206 --> 20:27.023
Why don't you just text me?

20:28.459 --> 20:30.994
I know it was wrong
and I know you're hurt,

20:31.028 --> 20:33.413
but you're taking it
out on everyone,

20:33.464 --> 20:36.083
and that's not fair.
We need you for regionals!

20:36.134 --> 20:37.751
You don't need me, all right?

20:37.802 --> 20:39.703
Jake's a better dancer,
Artie's a better singer,

20:39.721 --> 20:40.870
and Sam's better looking.

20:40.889 --> 20:42.372
Now you're just feeling
sorry for yourself.

20:42.390 --> 20:44.541
We're not competing with
each other, we're a team and...

20:44.559 --> 20:45.976
Why?

20:46.010 --> 20:49.146
Why what? I need to know why.
Okay, you say we're

20:49.180 --> 20:52.048
a team, but you've been lying
to me and messing with my head,

20:52.066 --> 20:54.884
and I need some kind of explanation
if I'm gonna go to regionals.

20:54.903 --> 20:56.320
Because....

20:58.523 --> 21:01.241
because I know
I'm not your vision of beauty.

21:03.328 --> 21:05.562
Wait. It-It was...?

21:05.580 --> 21:08.949
Yes, I'm Unique aka Wade,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.734
aka Katie, aka Catfish.

21:10.752 --> 21:13.537
Marley, I love you,
but you don't have to cover

21:13.571 --> 21:14.671
for me anymore.

21:14.706 --> 21:16.974
It started
off innocent at first,

21:17.008 --> 21:20.127
and then he started
telling me things,

21:20.178 --> 21:22.346
and it got way
too deep to stop.

21:22.380 --> 21:23.847
And you don't know how long

21:23.881 --> 21:26.216
it's been since I felt this
close to someone

21:26.250 --> 21:27.751
without all of this

21:27.769 --> 21:29.052
<i>getting in the way.</i>

21:31.272 --> 21:34.308
I know you're probably
gonna punch me in the face,

21:34.359 --> 21:38.478
but the truth is, I reached out
to you because I liked you.

21:38.529 --> 21:40.647
So I got a picture
of a cute blonde

21:40.698 --> 21:42.099
to make you like me back.

21:42.133 --> 21:46.036
But all the stories,
all the jokes,

21:46.070 --> 21:48.822
the connection that we had,
that was all me.

21:48.873 --> 21:51.375
And that was all real.

21:51.409 --> 21:53.744
I'm sorry I stayed hidden.

21:53.778 --> 21:57.113
I didn't do it to hurt you.

21:57.131 --> 21:59.115
I just...

21:59.133 --> 22:02.052
I really don't want
to lose what we have.

22:05.890 --> 22:08.458
We don't have anything.

22:10.561 --> 22:12.562
I'm not gonna punch you
in the face.

22:15.966 --> 22:18.735
But I'm also not gonna
talk to you ever again.

22:26.110 --> 22:28.111
♪ Fresh fondue for two!

22:28.145 --> 22:30.530

22:30.581 --> 22:33.200
very special episode

22:37.338 --> 22:38.422
Let's get started.

22:38.456 --> 22:40.657
Thank you again
for taking the Lima Express

22:40.675 --> 22:43.043
all the way from New York City,
again, to be here.

22:43.094 --> 22:44.828
Well, actually, Britt, I
came here to talk to you,

22:44.846 --> 22:46.129
not do a show, but...

22:46.163 --> 22:48.265
Well, it's the same
thing, so true or false?

22:48.299 --> 22:51.268
Lady Hummel and Grandma Berry
both play bingo down

22:51.302 --> 22:54.271
at the V.A. and knit alpaca
mittens on Saturday nights.

22:54.305 --> 22:55.439
No, no, totally false.

22:55.473 --> 22:56.723
I wish they were that exciting.
Aw, shoot.

22:56.774 --> 22:57.808
But seriously, Britt,
enough is enough.

22:57.842 --> 22:58.809
I'm turning this off.

22:58.843 --> 23:00.110
What are you doing?

23:00.144 --> 23:01.111
Lord Tubbington's a stickler

Brittany, stop it.

23:04.148 --> 23:07.067
Seriously, what the hell
is going on with you?

23:07.118 --> 23:08.402
You're acting like a
completely different person,

23:08.453 --> 23:10.237
and it's making me sad.

23:10.288 --> 23:11.822
Well, get over it...
sadness is stupid.

23:14.459 --> 23:17.828
Britt, I still care about you.

23:17.862 --> 23:20.914
As a person and as
a friend, and...

23:20.965 --> 23:22.899
this just isn't you.

23:24.869 --> 23:26.420
What I'm about to tell you

23:26.471 --> 23:28.505
is going to change
everything, Santana.

23:33.506 --> 23:35.452
Oh, I made it. Hi.

23:35.486 --> 23:37.621
Sorry... I'm so nervous.

23:37.655 --> 23:40.858
I had to ran and got us some
gummy bears to calm my stomach.

23:40.892 --> 23:43.093
No wonder you're nervous...
you're wearing white.

23:43.111 --> 23:44.928
That's not exactly
your lucky color.

23:44.946 --> 23:46.596
I think you'll find our luck's
about to change, Santana.

23:47.649 --> 23:50.000

All right, everybody.

28:58.563 --> 29:00.864
New
Directions!,

29:00.898 --> 29:03.867
um, before we go onstage,

29:03.901 --> 29:06.570
I have something I want
to tell you guys.

29:09.207 --> 29:11.542
I got offered
early admission to MIT.

29:14.078 --> 29:15.879
I never thought that I would...

29:15.913 --> 29:18.181
graduate high school, let
alone go to college, so...

29:18.216 --> 29:21.251
I have to jump on this offer
before it gets taken away.

29:21.269 --> 29:22.886
They want me
to leave immediately.

29:22.920 --> 29:25.689
That's why I had that meltdown.

29:27.425 --> 29:30.894
Um... my entire life,

29:30.928 --> 29:34.731
people have always told me
that I was stupid.

29:34.765 --> 29:39.769
And... after a while
I started to believe them.

29:40.771 --> 29:43.740
And it wasn't until...

29:43.774 --> 29:46.743
I walked in this room...

29:46.777 --> 29:48.612
...and I joined this club

29:48.630 --> 29:51.114
that I really started
believing in myself.

29:51.132 --> 29:54.668
And as soon as I did that,
as soon as...

29:54.719 --> 29:58.672
I started believing that maybe
I was smart after all,

29:58.723 --> 30:01.341
I think
the whole world did, too.

30:04.095 --> 30:07.064
And I'm really
gonna miss you guys.

30:09.100 --> 30:11.234
'Cause you guys
are like my family.

30:13.438 --> 30:15.772
Mr. Shue's like our dad.

30:16.741 --> 30:21.244
And Mercedes and Tina

30:21.279 --> 30:24.648
and Sugar and Mercedes,

30:24.666 --> 30:26.700
you guys are all
like my sisters.

30:26.751 --> 30:29.119
And Mike Chang

30:29.153 --> 30:30.704
and Blaine and Jim,
you guys are all

30:30.755 --> 30:32.155
like my brothers.

30:32.173 --> 30:35.425
My name's Joe.
And, Artie,

30:35.460 --> 30:37.711
you're like
the boy next door who...

30:37.762 --> 30:41.465
builds robots in his basement
and who I take his virginity,

30:41.499 --> 30:43.667
and Jake and Marley and Ryder

30:43.685 --> 30:47.387
and Kitty, you guys are
all like the foster kids

30:47.438 --> 30:49.940
who come to live with us
when the orphanage closes

30:49.974 --> 30:53.276

we've all been waiting for.

37:54.332 --> 37:57.334
In second place...

...from Indianapolis, Indiana,
the Hoosierdaddies,

39:15.296 --> 39:16.913

on its way to becoming

39:16.964 --> 39:19.082
a regionals dynasty!

39:19.133 --> 39:21.585
Only 24 more of these babies
before we catch up

39:21.636 --> 39:23.169
to Vocal Adrenaline.
Oh, please.

39:23.203 --> 39:24.838
Vocal Adrenaline's time
has passed.

39:24.872 --> 39:27.841
The present and the future is
all about the New Directions!

39:27.875 --> 39:31.011
And we are going to prove it
when we go to sunny Los Angeles

39:31.045 --> 39:33.847
for nationals and take home
our second national championship

39:33.881 --> 39:36.433
in a row! That's right.
That's right.

39:36.484 --> 39:39.436
Miss Pillsbury,
who's your friend?

39:40.821 --> 39:42.939
Um, Miss Pillsbury, you're
supposed to bring someone in

39:42.990 --> 39:44.941
to bless the team
<i>before</i> the big game.

39:44.992 --> 39:47.360
Okay. Thank you.

39:47.394 --> 39:50.530
Um, I figured out
that I can't handle the pressure

39:50.564 --> 39:53.667
of a big wedding,
so I told Will,

39:53.701 --> 39:57.671
if we're gonna get married, that
I wanted an intimate ceremony

39:57.705 --> 40:02.175
in a special place surrounded
by the people that we love.

40:02.209 --> 40:04.177
Are you guys seriously
throwing a surprise wedding?

40:04.211 --> 40:06.296
Just like Brooke Burke
and David Charvet?

40:06.347 --> 40:10.100
Yes.  No music,
no reception, no planning.

40:10.134 --> 40:13.270
Just me, the one true love
of my life,

40:13.304 --> 40:15.805
and then we'll have
a little dinner at Breadstix.

40:52.677 --> 40:54.978
- You're still here.
- I'm here.

40:55.012 --> 40:56.680
Do you guys have

40:56.731 --> 40:59.149
vows prepared?
I knew I forgot something

40:59.183 --> 41:00.817
No.

41:00.851 --> 41:03.937
Um... Well, hold on. You always get
to make the romantic speeches,

41:03.971 --> 41:07.190
so, um, why don't you
let me do it this time?

41:07.241 --> 41:10.910
I'd love that.
Yeah? Okay.

41:10.945 --> 41:12.912
There was this one day, um,

41:12.947 --> 41:15.115
right around the time
that we first met.

41:15.149 --> 41:16.533
Um, out in the courtyard.

41:16.584 --> 41:18.835
And I had gum stuck

41:18.869 --> 41:20.003
to the bottom of my shoe,

41:20.037 --> 41:22.839
and you scraped it off
with a credit card.

41:22.873 --> 41:24.541
And whenever things in my head

41:24.592 --> 41:27.844
get all gooey and sticky and
messy and I can't get 'em out,

41:27.878 --> 41:30.380
you always come along
and you make me feel clean

41:30.431 --> 41:33.183
and you make me feel
whole again.

41:33.217 --> 41:37.103
Will, just as I know
that the sky is blue,

41:37.138 --> 41:41.524
I know that you and I
are meant to be together.

41:41.559 --> 41:44.227
You are my hero, you are...

41:44.278 --> 41:47.364
my one true love,
you are my inspiration.

41:47.398 --> 41:49.733
I love you, Will Schuester.

41:49.784 --> 41:52.619
I can't
believe this is happening.

41:57.291 --> 42:00.577
I-I remember
that day with the gum.

42:00.628 --> 42:03.380
And the day you chaperoned
the field trip to Carmel High.

42:03.414 --> 42:05.715
And the red coat you wore

42:05.750 --> 42:08.051
when you took the team
to their first sectionals.

42:08.085 --> 42:09.753
I love that coat. I got it on sale.

42:12.256 --> 42:15.392
I remember and notice
everything about you.

42:17.428 --> 42:20.063
You only get one
true love of your life.

42:20.097 --> 42:22.098
And you are mine, Emma.

42:22.149 --> 42:24.484
And I promise you
that as long as you

42:24.518 --> 42:26.736
just keep being you
and-and let me love you,

42:26.771 --> 42:28.405
I will be
the happiest man alive.

42:28.439 --> 42:31.074
And can we just skip to the
"I do" part because I can't...

42:31.108 --> 42:32.075
I can't

42:32.109 --> 42:33.443
spend one more minute

42:33.494 --> 42:35.111
without being
this woman's husband.

42:35.162 --> 42:37.747
Works for me. I have
a reservation at Breadstix, too.

42:37.782 --> 42:39.666
We'll see you there.

42:39.700 --> 42:40.667
Emma,

42:40.701 --> 42:43.203
do you take Will
to be your husband,

42:43.237 --> 42:46.756
to love and honor, forsaking all
others from this day forward?

42:46.791 --> 42:49.759
I do. I do. I do. I do.

42:49.794 --> 42:50.760
Will?

42:50.795 --> 42:52.178
Oh, I definitely do.

42:53.631 --> 42:55.598
By the power vested in me

42:55.633 --> 42:58.435
and all the rest, Will, Emma...

42:58.469 --> 43:02.605
Wemma... I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

43:02.640 --> 43:04.691
Oh!
