01:10.947 --> 01:12.657
Wilee.

01:52.530 --> 01:53.656
Shit.

01:58.870 --> 02:01.039
<i>I can't work in an office.</i>

02:01.122 --> 02:03.082
<i>I don't like wearing suits.</i>

02:03.166 --> 02:04.334
<i>I like to ride.</i>

02:04.959 --> 02:07.128
<i>Fixed gear, steel frame, no brakes.</i>

02:07.212 --> 02:09.047
<i>The bike cannot coast.</i>

02:09.214 --> 02:11.466
<i>The pedals never stop turning.</i>

02:11.883 --> 02:13.009
<i>Can't stop.</i>

02:13.676 --> 02:14.803
<i>Don't want to either.</i>

02:16.888 --> 02:19.599
<i>There are 1,500 bike messengers
on the street in New York City.</i>

02:20.141 --> 02:22.769
<i>You can e-mail it, FedEx
it, fax it, scan it,</i>

02:22.852 --> 02:24.729
<i>but when none of that shit works</i>

02:24.813 --> 02:28.024
<i>and this thing has to be
at that place by this time,</i>

02:28.191 --> 02:29.567
<i>you need us.</i>

02:32.779 --> 02:35.323
<i>Some of us get killed out here.</i>

02:35.406 --> 02:36.741
<i>Pedestrians are a menace.</i>

02:38.451 --> 02:39.577
<i>Cabs are killers.</i>

02:40.703 --> 02:43.122
<i>One time or another we all get hit.</i>

02:43.206 --> 02:45.333
<i>Sometimes we gotta hit back.</i>

02:45.792 --> 02:47.544
If you're not gonna use it,

02:49.754 --> 02:50.922
I guess you don't need it.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.006
My mirror!

02:55.927 --> 03:00.890
<i>And we stick together, 'cause most people
just wish we'd get off the street.</i>

03:00.974 --> 03:04.269
<i>"Go get a haircut. Take a shower.
Get out of the way. "</i>

03:04.644 --> 03:05.812
Stop!

03:07.355 --> 03:09.065
Pay heed!

03:09.983 --> 03:13.528
<i>They have no idea why anyone would
risk their lives in a death maze</i>

03:13.611 --> 03:15.280
<i>for 80 bucks on a good day.</i>

03:16.990 --> 03:19.242
<i>But if you're out here
thinking about the money,</i>

03:19.701 --> 03:21.995
<i>you're not gonna be around to spend it.</i>

03:44.267 --> 03:45.518
Hey!

04:04.662 --> 04:08.082
<i>Hey, it's Vanessa.
Leave me a message and I'll call you back.</i>

04:08.166 --> 04:12.086
'Kay, I'm actually leaving a voice mail now.
This is demeaning. Why won't you call me?

04:12.879 --> 04:14.005
Hey.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.427
- Samantha Harris, TVM?
- Yep.

04:21.596 --> 04:23.723
And sign here, please.

04:24.891 --> 04:26.517
You need a number, too?

04:27.185 --> 04:29.062
- You got a pickup for me?
- You already got it.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.438
Positive I did not.

04:30.521 --> 04:31.856
No, someone from your company.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.524
What'd he look like?

04:33.608 --> 04:35.360
He was prettier than me.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.207
Hey, watch your back.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.805
Manny's office, this is Manny.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.056
Dude, you jumped my route?

05:05.556 --> 05:07.308
I had a drop-off.
It was sitting right there, man.

05:07.392 --> 05:08.559
<i>Dude, but that's my tag.</i>

05:08.643 --> 05:10.186
Then how come it's in my bag?

05:10.269 --> 05:11.521
I'm coming to get it.

05:11.604 --> 05:13.231
<i>Wasting your time, man.
I'm almost there already.</i>

05:14.190 --> 05:15.441
Well, I'm right behind you.

05:15.608 --> 05:18.236
Yo, it isn't yours, it's mine now.
Like your girlfriend.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.530
Oh, I'm getting worried, dude.
Real concerned.

05:20.613 --> 05:23.616
It's been a couple of days.
Manny's a gentleman,

05:23.783 --> 05:25.785
but Manny's got appetites. Click!

05:26.202 --> 05:27.412
Asshole.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.265
No, no, no, sweetheart.
Think Gandhi, not Sitting Bull. Boom!

05:47.348 --> 05:48.349
Yes, I'm already on it.

05:48.433 --> 05:49.892
Sweetheart, I gotta go.

05:49.976 --> 05:51.686
Security Courier.

05:52.228 --> 05:54.230
- Get line two a 20 on Squid.
- Got it.

05:54.313 --> 05:57.442
I'm right here. Goddamn radio got run over.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.694
Raj. What the hell, man.
Manny jumped my route?

05:59.777 --> 06:00.945
Is it so?

06:01.029 --> 06:04.198
Yes, it's so. You shouldn't try to be Zen,
dude. You're wearing a gold chain.

06:04.282 --> 06:08.536
Tito, my midtown monster,
slow and steady comes in last.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.288
You get passed by a hot dog cart today?

06:10.371 --> 06:13.624
The pedals turn, Raj. Not just the
left one, but the right one, too.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.209
I have no idea what he's talking about.

06:15.293 --> 06:19.380
The words he says, they don't go together
to create meaning in a traditional sense,

06:19.464 --> 06:20.965
but I believe it is profound.

06:21.049 --> 06:22.800
Hey, I'm light. You got
anything else today?

06:22.884 --> 06:24.969
- I need another job.
- The pedals turn, my friend, the pedals turn.

06:25.053 --> 06:27.346
- That doesn't mean anything.
- Well, Tito said it, not me.

06:28.639 --> 06:29.724
No hello?

06:29.807 --> 06:32.560
Hey, Vanessa, I hope you're gonna fix
that wheel and get back out there.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.728
Yep.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.069
Why didn't you call me back?

06:41.152 --> 06:43.654
I don't have anything else to say.

06:46.991 --> 06:48.868
Okay, I know you're not
about to kiss me right now.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.079
Why? You don't want me to?

06:51.162 --> 06:52.747
My hand to God, I don't.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.415
Then why did your back just arch?

06:54.499 --> 06:55.750
- It did not.
- Yes, it did.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.960
- Nope.
- Like it always does.

06:59.337 --> 07:01.589
- See, you did it again.
- Stop!

07:03.049 --> 07:05.051
- Really? Come on.
- No.

07:05.510 --> 07:06.761
Okay. Ride safe.

07:07.637 --> 07:08.930
Security Courier.

07:09.013 --> 07:11.182
Yo, Nima, what's up?

07:11.766 --> 07:13.768
Yeah, he's here. Where we going?

07:13.851 --> 07:15.019
Okay.

07:15.853 --> 07:19.232
Okay. All right. Great. Got it.

07:19.315 --> 07:21.776
Wilee, you're in luck.
Your alma mater summons.

07:21.859 --> 07:25.738
116th Street entrance, law school
main office, drop is in Chinatown.

07:25.822 --> 07:28.282
I need you south of Pell in 90 minutes.
Let's go.

07:28.366 --> 07:30.535
You're getting 50 for that run at least.
Give me 40.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.370
Forget it. Tito.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.538
Never mind.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.624
Marco. Polo.
I got a nice long run for you guys.

07:36.707 --> 07:37.959
- Can't do it.
- Why not?

07:38.042 --> 07:39.752
- Gotta get hammered.
- Fair enough.

07:39.836 --> 07:43.297
Come on, man. I'm tired, I'm hungry, my day is
taking a turn for the shitty, give me the 40.

07:43.381 --> 07:46.342
I'll give you 30. Don't screw it up.
It's premium rush.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.055
Hey, Wilee.

07:51.139 --> 07:53.391
You and me, man! Central Park.
Just one lap.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.976
Straight up bicycle race.

07:55.059 --> 07:58.146
No whale riding, no bumper surfing,
none-a your alleycat bullshit.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.065
I'll kick your ass, man.
Have you seen my thighs?

08:01.149 --> 08:03.234
Have you seen my thighs?

08:26.007 --> 08:27.008
What do you want?

08:27.592 --> 08:29.093
So you into Spandex now?

08:29.260 --> 08:30.761
On your right!

08:31.095 --> 08:33.847
God, can you forget about Manny?
He's just helping me move.

08:34.265 --> 08:36.142
Move? What, you guys are moving?

08:36.225 --> 08:38.852
<i>- No, I'm moving, she's staying.</i>
- Why?

08:38.936 --> 08:41.522
<i>I don't wanna talk about it.
She wants me out by the end of the day.</i>

08:41.606 --> 08:43.191
<i>What, did you get into
a fight with her, too?</i>

08:43.274 --> 08:44.692
I'll call you back.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.277
Shit.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.715
Hey, walk that thing!

09:11.052 --> 09:13.304
Wilee? It is you.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.805
Hey, man.

09:15.306 --> 09:16.724
Hey, what you been up to, man?

09:16.807 --> 09:18.809
You know, running reds, killing peds.

09:18.893 --> 09:20.853
I heard you never took the bar.

09:20.937 --> 09:22.647
It's on my list.

09:22.730 --> 09:23.981
Don't stress about it.

09:24.065 --> 09:26.567
Hey, they say if you snort some Ritalin,
it's a cakewalk.

09:26.651 --> 09:28.486
Sage advice, Mr Hand.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.202
Hey, Nima. They didn't tell me
it was you who called. That it?

09:36.285 --> 09:39.455
It must be there by 7:00.
Deliver only to Sister Chen.

09:39.538 --> 09:40.665
Where am I going?

09:40.748 --> 09:44.835
Chinatown. 147, Doyers.
Is that going to be difficult?

09:45.503 --> 09:46.587
Would be for some.

09:46.671 --> 09:50.675
- It's a tiny street, very hard to see...
<i>- I'll</i> find it. Time is now 5:33.

09:51.968 --> 09:55.012
Sign here
and print your name under it, please.

09:57.181 --> 09:58.391
You Okay?

09:58.849 --> 10:03.104
I heard you got roommate troubles.
I feel bad, I kinda hooked you guys up.

10:03.187 --> 10:07.149
Deliver only to Sister Chen.
It must be there by 7:00.

10:07.525 --> 10:08.859
It's extremely important.

10:09.694 --> 10:10.987
Always is.

10:16.951 --> 10:18.119
Gonna need the envelope.

10:22.707 --> 10:24.667
Thanks. Have a nice day.

10:29.880 --> 10:30.923
Hey!

10:31.048 --> 10:32.842
Hey, there you are.

11:02.580 --> 11:03.748
Hey!

11:04.248 --> 11:05.791
Hey, excuse me, messenger guy.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.877
That envelope you picked up,
I gotta ask for it back.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.378
- Who are you?
- Forrest J. Ackerman.

11:09.462 --> 11:11.672
Head of campus security.
The woman who gave you the envelope,

11:11.756 --> 11:13.591
she's not authorized
to use the school account.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.510
It's an internal matter I've been investigating.
Not your problem.

11:16.594 --> 11:18.012
Can I have the envelope, please?

11:18.387 --> 11:20.848
Yeah, the thing is, once it goes in
the bag, it's gotta stay in the bag

11:20.931 --> 11:22.516
unless I hear from a dispatcher.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.353
Fine. Call him. I'll talk to him.
I got the receipt right here.

11:25.436 --> 11:27.521
- Nima gave that to you?
- Who?

11:28.189 --> 11:29.315
Nima.

11:29.398 --> 11:32.276
You don't know the name
of the woman you're investigating?

11:32.360 --> 11:34.862
Yeah. Nima, right. I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you. Your mouth was full.

11:35.696 --> 11:39.533
Thing is, man, company I work for,
it's called "Security Courier."

11:39.617 --> 11:42.036
The "Security" part means that
once people give us their shit,

11:42.119 --> 11:44.622
we don't just hand it out to
random strangers on the street, so...

11:44.789 --> 11:47.792
Listen, I just spent $7
on this delicious urban food log,

11:47.875 --> 11:50.211
so if you'd step aside and let me eat,
that'd be great.

11:52.296 --> 11:53.547
What's your name?

11:53.631 --> 11:55.132
- Wilee.
- Wilee.

11:55.925 --> 11:58.427
Wile E? Like the coyote?

11:59.303 --> 12:00.679
- That's cute.
- Thanks.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.807
You got a real name? A girlfriend?

12:02.890 --> 12:05.351
Family? People who give a shit
if they see you again?

12:06.477 --> 12:07.728
Who are you, man?

12:07.812 --> 12:10.314
I'm the guy you don't fuck with.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.486
Hold my log.

12:20.324 --> 12:21.617
Hey!

12:24.412 --> 12:26.080
Have a nice day, douche bag!

12:26.622 --> 12:27.748
Okay.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.603
I just wanted to say I was sorry.

12:49.687 --> 12:53.607
That thing was important to me.
Maybe that doesn't mean shit to you...

12:53.691 --> 12:55.609
No, it means something to me.
I just forgot, that's all.

12:55.693 --> 12:57.027
Okay, I get it.

12:57.278 --> 12:58.863
Look, this is three sorrys now.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.197
<i>It's actually only two.</i>

13:00.281 --> 13:03.451
Well, you hung up on one of 'em,
so that's on you.

13:03.534 --> 13:06.537
I don't get it. Honestly? Watch it!

13:06.620 --> 13:07.705
Excuse me.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.290
I just don't get it.

13:09.373 --> 13:12.418
I mean, you have opportunity
and all that brain and you throw it away.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.379
Look, why are we having this conversation?
You get it. You ride like I do.

13:15.463 --> 13:18.966
No, I ride, but not like you, Wilee.
I put a brake on my bike and I use it.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.469
Yeah, and that brake's gonna get you killed.
You should get rid of that.

13:21.552 --> 13:23.762
The worst shit that ever happened to me
happened when I had a brake.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.139
Brakes are death.

13:25.473 --> 13:29.477
You know what? That thing you
say, it's not as cute any more.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.312
You could have any job you want.

13:31.395 --> 13:34.482
When I see a guy in a grey business suit,
my age,

13:34.565 --> 13:36.942
makes my balls shrivel up into my abdomen.

13:37.026 --> 13:38.235
Whatever.

13:38.319 --> 13:39.403
Hi, Alonzo.

13:39.487 --> 13:42.490
We get paid to ride.
What could be better than that?

13:42.573 --> 13:44.366
<i>Do you know why I ride?</i>

13:44.450 --> 13:46.660
Because I hate waiting tables. Thank you.

13:46.744 --> 13:50.289
Look, I'm sorry
that I didn't come to your school thing.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.957
But what do you want me to
do about it right now?

13:52.041 --> 13:53.125
<i>My "school thing"?</i>

13:53.209 --> 13:56.086
It was graduation
and you blew it off for a race.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.631
Look, I know it took me eight years
to get my degree,

13:58.714 --> 14:02.343
but I'm gonna get a decent job
and sit behind a desk all day.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.970
I don't need anyone in my life
telling me that it's meaningless

14:05.054 --> 14:06.680
'cause it means something to me.

14:06.764 --> 14:09.099
<i>And I need to know that I can count on you.</i>

14:10.518 --> 14:11.644
<i>Hello?</i>

14:11.727 --> 14:13.687
- I gotta go.
- Of course you do.

14:13.771 --> 14:15.856
I'm gonna call you back.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.527
Hey, what?

14:19.777 --> 14:22.363
Douche bag?
What the hell's the matter with you?

14:22.446 --> 14:25.449
Come on, son, this is silly.
You're gonna skin your knee.

14:25.533 --> 14:27.535
I think I'll be all right.
Thank you, though.

14:27.618 --> 14:29.328
Just pull over, right up here.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.163
Come on.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.375
You're a very uncooperative guy,
you know that?

14:35.042 --> 14:36.794
- Come on, give it to me!
- No!

14:40.589 --> 14:41.674
You take care now!

14:43.592 --> 14:44.843
Shit!

15:19.628 --> 15:20.754
Shit.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.342
I'm chasing a bicycle.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.707
Jesus.

16:28.072 --> 16:29.365
Tricky.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.078
- You moron!
- You're right!

16:34.161 --> 16:36.330
- You maniac!
- Sorry! My fault!

16:39.667 --> 16:42.044
Hey! Give me the envelope!

16:42.461 --> 16:43.504
What?

16:43.587 --> 16:46.423
- You can hear me, you little shit.
- Sorry, I can't hear you!

16:46.507 --> 16:48.842
What's it to you? Come on!

16:50.219 --> 16:52.971
Give me the goddamn envelope!

16:53.430 --> 16:55.265
That? No.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.023
No, no, no.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.991
I just wish they wouldn't ride
on the sidewalk, you know?

17:13.075 --> 17:15.118
I mean, look,
I understand you've got a job to do.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.329
Excuse me!

17:27.756 --> 17:28.841
Hey, hey!

17:28.924 --> 17:30.926
Hey, hey, hey! Slow down!

17:37.850 --> 17:40.394
Now, see?
I told you this wouldn't end well for you.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.065
Where'd you go?

17:46.734 --> 17:47.776
Hey!

17:48.235 --> 17:49.486
Come here!

17:53.866 --> 17:55.659
Hey!

18:00.414 --> 18:01.999
Yo, you crazy?

18:02.833 --> 18:05.669
NYPD! I wanna talk to you for a minute!

18:05.753 --> 18:07.004
Great.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.382
Hey! Pull over!

18:13.594 --> 18:14.678
Hey!

18:17.347 --> 18:19.183
Delinquent scum!

18:21.393 --> 18:22.978
Red shirt on the bicycle!

18:23.187 --> 18:24.605
NYPD!

18:26.440 --> 18:29.318
You just caused an accident back there!
Pull over!

18:31.695 --> 18:32.863
Come on.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.085
Oh, shit!

19:01.141 --> 19:02.309
My baby!

19:30.879 --> 19:32.089
Shit.

19:33.090 --> 19:34.466
You little shit.

19:41.723 --> 19:44.643
- Thanks for helping me with this.
- You know I'm always there for you.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.980
Well, I couldn't have done it on my own,
so thanks.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.858
Look, it's none of my business,

19:50.941 --> 19:54.486
but you know you saved yourself a lot of
heartache breaking up with the Coyote Man.

19:54.570 --> 19:56.780
I mean, seriously, you know, he's crazy.

19:56.989 --> 19:58.866
And it's not like
he's some great cyclist or something.

19:58.949 --> 20:02.953
I mean, he's just got a death wish, that's all.
That's no skill.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.420
Only reason he beats me in alleycats
is 'cause the man got a mental instability.

20:11.503 --> 20:14.631
I mean, all that fixie bullshit.
You know, the no brakes, no gears.

20:14.882 --> 20:17.175
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, I hear ya.

20:17.259 --> 20:20.053
Look, think about it, okay?

20:20.304 --> 20:24.641
He's broke his left collarbone twice. Got
a couple concussions, a pin in his wrist.

20:24.725 --> 20:27.811
That's when he was doing all that trick stuff.
He's not into that any more.

20:27.936 --> 20:32.024
Okay, sure, but the way he rides.
What does that tell you?

20:32.441 --> 20:34.234
How much he loves it, I guess.

20:34.735 --> 20:37.237
Then he's got him
some confused priorities, babe.

20:44.328 --> 20:46.538
Yeah. No, Manny.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.961
Hey, my roommate's in some kind of trouble
and she won't text me back.

20:53.045 --> 20:56.924
Can you just drop me off over on Broadway?
Please? I gotta go find her.

20:57.007 --> 20:59.217
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- Thanks.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.193
Jesus.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.070
Shit.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.952
- This douche bag tried to...
- I can hear you.

21:25.035 --> 21:26.244
Sorry.

21:27.079 --> 21:29.373
Guy tried to rob me
and run me over with his car.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.916
- Are you injured?
- No.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.377
- You wanna file a complaint?
- No, I want him arrested.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.587
It's like attempted vehicular manslaughter,
or whatever.

21:35.671 --> 21:36.755
Is it, Your Honour? Have a seat,

21:36.838 --> 21:38.199
someone will be right out to
take your statement.

21:38.215 --> 21:40.425
I also have a picture
of his license plate number.

21:40.509 --> 21:42.719
That's fantastic. Have a seat,
someone will be right with you.

21:42.803 --> 21:45.055
Thank you for your concern.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.621
Holy moly.

22:10.956 --> 22:12.416
Hey. What do ya know?

22:13.041 --> 22:15.377
Detective Monday graces us
with his presence.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.753
Yeah. I'm sorry I'm late.

22:16.878 --> 22:19.006
Your wife had a lot of unusual requests.

22:19.089 --> 22:21.508
- Yeah? She still got that rash?
- Yeah. I worked around it.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.012
What's the matter with your face, Monday?

22:25.095 --> 22:28.640
Goddamn tooth went abscess on me, vicious
little bastard. I go to the dentist,

22:29.808 --> 22:31.601
son of a bitch got me in the waiting room
an hour and a half.

22:31.685 --> 22:33.687
Finally, he sits me in the chair,
takes one look at it...

22:33.770 --> 22:37.691
Yanks it right out of my head. Can you believe it?
Yeah, that's why I'm late.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.213
Oh, yeah.

23:05.343 --> 23:07.512
Yeah. Got you now, sucker.

23:09.264 --> 23:10.557
Monster hand, monster hand.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.519
Jesus, you're kidding me!

23:14.853 --> 23:17.939
Goddamn shit! No!

23:18.106 --> 23:21.359
Next time better luck, Bobby, huh?
Not bad hand, not bad hand.

23:21.485 --> 23:22.486
Almost, Bobby.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.908
Everything okay, Bobby?

23:27.991 --> 23:30.452
It's great. I just gotta
get to work is all.

23:30.535 --> 23:32.287
Same old, same old.

23:32.579 --> 23:35.123
Mr Monday, Mr Sunday.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.419
Rebuy.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.091
Hello? Rebuy.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.683
- Let me get you a Coke, Bobby.
- No, thank you.

23:53.767 --> 23:56.728
- I need five grand. What's the problem?
- It's up to 17.

23:56.812 --> 23:58.396
Which happens to be my lucky number.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.149
This isn't your game, man.
Anglos don't have the math for Pai Gow.

24:01.233 --> 24:03.735
- Mr Lin thinks...
- What does Mr Lin think?

24:03.819 --> 24:06.404
He can't get shut down
'cause a cop owes him a few dollars?

24:06.488 --> 24:08.949
- Come on, you don't wanna talk like that.
- 72nd Street. Brooklyn Players.

24:09.032 --> 24:12.119
They all went down eventually.
They all go down, Charlie Chan.

24:12.202 --> 24:15.288
- Maybe you need to go get some fresh air.
- You take a walk in the park!

24:15.372 --> 24:16.540
I want a rebuy!

24:21.795 --> 24:24.256
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry.

24:24.339 --> 24:25.507
Sorry.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.551
Look, if you really need cash...

24:27.801 --> 24:30.178
- I shouldn't be telling you this.
- What?

24:30.262 --> 24:32.055
You know that bitch snakehead
my sister works for?

24:32.139 --> 24:34.182
- Yeah.
- She said they got a serious ticket

24:34.266 --> 24:36.560
coming down from a hawaladar
in Morning side, tonight.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.813
- How much is it worth?
- Fifty grand.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.815
And that ticket is as good as cash.

24:41.898 --> 24:43.692
If you get a hold of that thing
and bring it here,

24:43.775 --> 24:45.694
your money problems with us are over.

24:45.777 --> 24:49.072
Maybe I take a little finder's fee,
let's just say a third.

24:49.156 --> 24:51.825
Mr Lin gets the rest, and you're even.

24:52.742 --> 24:55.495
What do I look like,
a change-snatcher to you? I'm a cop.

24:55.579 --> 24:57.664
I look like a purse-pincher,
a goddamn mugger?

24:57.747 --> 24:59.791
I'm just trying to help you out.

24:59.875 --> 25:04.754
You don't wanna do that, then be a big boy,
go to the Shy, borrow what you gotta borrow.

25:04.838 --> 25:08.341
- Mr Lin gets his 17, you're right back in.
- Yeah.

25:13.430 --> 25:15.015
- What's the vig?
- Twenty points.

25:15.098 --> 25:17.184
- That's ridiculous.
- Don't take it.

25:17.267 --> 25:20.145
- From our friends in Ozone Park?
- You wish.

25:20.228 --> 25:21.688
- Brighton Beach.
- Shit.

25:21.771 --> 25:23.773
Seriously, don't take it.

25:25.609 --> 25:26.902
Give it to me.

25:38.330 --> 25:40.165
Hey, where you going?

25:49.299 --> 25:51.801
- He took it across the street.
- I have now seen it all.

25:51.927 --> 25:53.595
Look at that sick bastard.

26:11.488 --> 26:12.739
Come on.

26:13.823 --> 26:16.284
Yeah, come on, come on.

26:17.327 --> 26:19.412
Are you sure you want
to put that all in one hand?

26:19.496 --> 26:20.997
Yeah, I'm sure.

26:22.249 --> 26:23.458
Come on.

26:23.541 --> 26:25.168
This is the one.

26:26.002 --> 26:29.047
Let's see, what do we got here?
What do we got?

26:29.130 --> 26:31.675
Keep your eyes to yourself,
all right, buddy?

26:31.841 --> 26:33.385
I'm not done.

26:33.593 --> 26:35.595
Six plus seven is shit!

26:35.679 --> 26:37.013
Six plus five is shit.

26:37.097 --> 26:40.225
Eight plus five is six...
Is seven... Is shit.

26:40.308 --> 26:43.103
It's all shit, no matter how you add it up.

26:46.773 --> 26:47.941
Yeah.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.527
Whatever, whatever. Thanks a lot.

26:57.367 --> 26:59.744
- That a Chinese phone book?
- Yeah.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.748
Don't stop yet.

27:05.041 --> 27:08.586
Why, you getting tired?
Hey, wait a minute. Wait.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.883
Tired, my ass.

27:23.476 --> 27:25.061
What... That...

27:26.354 --> 27:29.441
That's my tooth! You piece of shit!

27:29.524 --> 27:31.526
I said nothing permanent!

27:32.193 --> 27:34.279
Hey, I'm talking to you! Get over here!

27:34.821 --> 27:39.284
There are goddamn rules about this shit!
Okay? You think it doesn't apply?

27:39.367 --> 27:41.286
I'll take a lump or two
if I cross the line,

27:41.369 --> 27:43.246
but you think I'm gonna grow new teeth
at my age?

27:43.580 --> 27:45.623
- Mr Lin...
- Mr Lin!

27:45.707 --> 27:46.916
Hey!

27:47.751 --> 27:49.753
What? ls Mr Lin in charge?

27:51.046 --> 27:54.466
Is Mr Lin President of the United States?

27:55.717 --> 27:59.554
Let me tell ya something, boys. I am a cop!

28:01.264 --> 28:04.059
You do not do this!

28:11.483 --> 28:14.194
Hey. Come on, it wasn't that bad.

28:19.407 --> 28:22.410
He'll be all right. Come on. Come on, <i>papi.</i>

28:24.162 --> 28:26.122
Yeah, there you go. See?

28:28.625 --> 28:30.585
Get your buddy to Bellevue.

28:35.298 --> 28:37.675
Fourteen minutes. I timed it.

28:37.759 --> 28:41.513
That's how long it took you to soak
yourself in gasoline and set it on fire.

28:46.184 --> 28:48.812
That ticket you were talking about?

28:49.437 --> 28:51.898
I think I'm gonna need the address.

28:54.359 --> 28:57.737
Yeah, the goddamn dentist.
Is that a good enough reason for you?

28:57.821 --> 28:59.989
Two hours in the chair. Can you believe it?

29:01.324 --> 29:03.785
Well, a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

29:03.868 --> 29:07.247
I'm gonna go get my morphine.
I'll be right back.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.715
- You know, I've been thinking about firemen.
- What about 'em?

29:59.007 --> 30:02.886
They hang out together,
you know, they work out. They cook pasta.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.137
Pose for calendars.

30:04.554 --> 30:06.514
- What are you talking about?
- We should do that.

30:06.598 --> 30:07.765
I'm not posing for any calendar.

30:15.607 --> 30:16.816
No towels?

30:16.900 --> 30:18.234
Depressing.

30:47.096 --> 30:50.433
- Hey, look who's here, Lance Armstrong.
- Hey, what's up?

30:50.517 --> 30:52.977
- Hey, guys.
- Hold up a minute.

30:53.478 --> 30:55.104
- What's up?
- What happened to you?

30:55.230 --> 30:58.024
I just got my ass kicked
by a kid on a bicycle.

30:58.107 --> 31:00.610
- Jesus, you okay?
- I'm all right.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.989
Monday, come on, we gotta see that guy.

31:05.073 --> 31:06.783
Yeah, all right.

31:10.620 --> 31:13.081
Monday, seriously, we gotta go. Let's go.

31:14.082 --> 31:16.543
You talk to him this time.
He responds to you better.

31:16.626 --> 31:20.171
Really? I don't know why.
I can't stand the guy.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.632
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.

31:30.807 --> 31:32.934
Monday, are you coming?

31:34.936 --> 31:36.354
Yeah, I...

31:37.564 --> 31:40.316
I forgot my bullets.
I'll meet you guys there, okay?

31:40.775 --> 31:42.402
Who forgets their bullets?

31:42.485 --> 31:43.695
Monday.

32:14.517 --> 32:15.560
Shit.

32:25.028 --> 32:26.946
Hey, red shirt! NYPD!

32:27.030 --> 32:28.281
Come on, dude.

32:33.578 --> 32:35.496
Oh, really? I'm working on it.

32:35.580 --> 32:37.081
<i>- The guy's dead.</i>
- What?

32:37.165 --> 32:40.043
The guy you beat up, Bobby. He didn't
even make the ride to the hospital.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.753
You got a real knack for making it worse,
you know that?

32:44.672 --> 32:46.132
God damn it.

32:47.216 --> 32:48.509
I'll make amends.

32:48.593 --> 32:49.636
<i>Stan' with the money.</i>

32:49.719 --> 32:52.013
Get that ticket.
Bring it to Mr Lin's shop on 28th.

32:52.096 --> 32:53.848
You got one hour.

33:06.110 --> 33:09.155
Heads up. Look out, look out.
Outta the way.

33:18.456 --> 33:21.042
Police! On your left, lady, look out!

33:23.002 --> 33:24.545
Jesus Christ.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.256
What do you want me to do?

33:33.721 --> 33:35.890
Hello, everybody! Stand still!

33:35.973 --> 33:37.600
Lady, stand still! You're good.
There you go.

33:41.437 --> 33:44.273
Police! Coming through. Lady, please.

33:44.565 --> 33:45.775
Heads up, man.

33:59.539 --> 34:00.998
VVhoa, buddy!

34:03.918 --> 34:05.920
Oh, my God! Stop already!

34:13.886 --> 34:17.139
You're making it worse for yourself,
I swear to God!

34:17.348 --> 34:20.268
Keep the kids back! Keep 'em back! NYPD!

34:28.735 --> 34:29.777
No!

34:34.239 --> 34:36.033
God damn it!

35:18.868 --> 35:19.952
Mister!

35:20.036 --> 35:21.329
That Way!

35:23.122 --> 35:25.333
Get your arms inside the bus!

35:53.611 --> 35:54.654
<i>Dispatch.</i>

35:54.737 --> 35:56.614
What did you do to me, man?
What the hell am I carrying?

35:56.697 --> 35:57.782
Wilee? Where are you?

35:57.865 --> 36:00.701
I do not carry drug shit,
or whatever the hell this is!

36:00.785 --> 36:02.703
It's not drugs. It can't be drugs.

36:02.787 --> 36:04.831
It's from a highly respected
East Coast college.

36:04.914 --> 36:06.457
- It's probably drugs.
- Yep.

36:06.582 --> 36:10.044
Listen to me. I almost got my ass killed
three times in the last 20 minutes!

36:10.127 --> 36:11.254
And it wasn't my fault!

36:11.504 --> 36:13.631
Is somebody messing with you?
You need backup?

36:13.714 --> 36:15.925
No. I just wanna get rid of the thing.

36:16.008 --> 36:17.093
Well, I got nobody else.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.470
The only person here is Tito,
and I can't send him that far north.

36:19.554 --> 36:22.390
The guy's like 98 years old. No of fence.

36:23.432 --> 36:24.433
Dude, just call the college

36:24.517 --> 36:26.769
and tell them I'm bringing the package
back, okay? I'm done with it.

36:26.936 --> 36:30.398
No, no, don't take it back!
Come on! Wilee...

36:33.484 --> 36:35.027
Manny.

36:35.194 --> 36:37.029
Just the person I need to see.

36:37.780 --> 36:38.781
What's up?

37:06.017 --> 37:10.104
Yeah, hello. I'm calling about
an order you just picked up.

37:11.647 --> 37:13.149
Order number?

37:14.609 --> 37:18.321
Yep, yep, got it right here. 2231970.

37:21.157 --> 37:22.909
Yeah, that's it.

37:23.826 --> 37:27.830
I'm gonna need to change
the delivery address on that envelope.

37:29.290 --> 37:32.752
Yeah. Me, I'm Forrest J. Ackerman,
Dean of Students.

37:41.844 --> 37:44.096
I've got that appointment now.
I'll see you in a bit.

37:44.180 --> 37:45.306
Okay.

38:16.003 --> 38:17.380
- Hi.
- Hey.

38:17.630 --> 38:20.341
I'm almost done.
My friend borrowed a truck to help me move,

38:20.424 --> 38:22.677
so I'll be outta here by 6:00.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.095
Thank you.

38:24.178 --> 38:27.348
I'm sorry it is so sudden.
You will be all right?

38:27.515 --> 38:30.393
Yeah. I'm staying with my aunt
until I find a place.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.686
Okay, good.

38:31.769 --> 38:33.145
I still don't get what happened.

38:33.229 --> 38:35.356
Did I do something
to piss you off or something?

38:35.439 --> 38:37.400
No, I told you, it's a private matter.

38:38.484 --> 38:39.568
Okay.

38:40.361 --> 38:43.197
Excuse me, I have some things
to take care of.

38:55.793 --> 38:57.837
- Where'd you get all that?
- This is my business.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.047
- Better for you to stay out of it.
- Are you going out with that?

39:00.131 --> 39:02.550
'Cause this is New York City,
you can't walk around with all that money.

39:02.633 --> 39:04.802
- Where are you going?
- Down the street.

39:04.885 --> 39:06.137
- Where?
- The nail salon.

39:06.262 --> 39:07.263
The nail salon?

39:07.430 --> 39:09.974
This is something I have to do.
I don't have a choice.

39:10.057 --> 39:11.308
Okay. I'm coming with you.

39:11.434 --> 39:13.060
No, thank you.

40:04.028 --> 40:05.446
Mr Leung?

40:22.505 --> 40:24.507
- NYPD.
- Yeah?

40:25.007 --> 40:26.175
You got a minute?

40:38.979 --> 40:40.189
Count it.

40:44.276 --> 40:46.362
A lot of money for a young lady.

40:46.654 --> 40:49.281
Took me two years. I work three jobs.

40:50.783 --> 40:52.785
American dream, huh?

40:53.244 --> 40:54.578
Is to work three jobs?

40:54.912 --> 40:56.622
These days, yes.

40:59.208 --> 41:00.751
You speak Mandarin?

41:01.168 --> 41:02.545
Yes.

41:03.045 --> 41:08.342
If you lose the ticket
I cannot give you back the money.

41:09.051 --> 41:10.803
You understand?

41:12.346 --> 41:14.557
This ticket now is money.

41:15.391 --> 41:17.893
For whoever holds it.

41:20.521 --> 41:22.565
If you have problems

41:23.232 --> 41:25.276
you don't call the police

41:25.901 --> 41:27.736
you call this number.

41:30.156 --> 41:33.826
The Hawala system settles its own problems.

41:36.745 --> 41:39.248
This money is for a snakehead?

41:39.415 --> 41:40.958
- Yes.
- Which one?

41:41.417 --> 41:42.459
Sister Chen.

41:42.626 --> 41:44.420
She won't take cash.

41:44.628 --> 41:46.255
She sent me to you.

41:47.047 --> 41:51.468
Did you tell anyone you were coming here?

41:51.927 --> 41:53.721
Only my friend.

41:54.763 --> 41:57.766
This city is not your village.

41:58.684 --> 42:02.396
Many people would rob you
if they know what you have.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.607
My friend wouldn't tell anyone.

42:04.857 --> 42:07.443
If she did they may be watching for you.

42:14.366 --> 42:17.077
Can someone else deliver
the ticket for you?

42:17.369 --> 42:20.247
Someone they won't recognise?

42:21.248 --> 42:22.708
I don't know.

42:23.959 --> 42:25.002
Think about it.

42:25.336 --> 42:28.589
May the Buddha watch over you.

42:50.152 --> 42:51.403
Hey!

43:19.556 --> 43:20.975
Security Courier.

43:21.058 --> 43:22.601
Yo, Nima. What's up?

43:22.768 --> 43:27.064
I have a pickup from our office.
It will be ready in about 10 minutes.

43:28.023 --> 43:29.108
Is Wilee available?

43:29.525 --> 43:31.610
Yeah, he's here. Where we going?

43:31.694 --> 43:32.820
Okay.

43:33.737 --> 43:36.865
Okay, all right. Great. Got it.

43:37.157 --> 43:39.034
Wilee, you're in luck.
Your alma mater summons.

43:47.793 --> 43:49.044
Come on!

44:18.615 --> 44:20.409
Good to see you, too.

44:21.702 --> 44:23.078
Excuse me.

44:41.680 --> 44:42.765
Damn.

44:46.268 --> 44:47.603
Damn it.

44:49.021 --> 44:50.689
- Hey. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

44:50.773 --> 44:51.857
NYPD.

44:51.940 --> 44:56.403
I'm looking for a young Asian woman,
about 22, 23, blue shirt, black pants.

44:56.487 --> 44:58.530
She just walked by a minute ago.

44:58.614 --> 45:00.532
- Know where I can find her?
- Let me think. Yeah, I do.

45:00.616 --> 45:02.659
Hey, walk that thing!

45:02.743 --> 45:03.869
Yeah, I believe so.

45:05.954 --> 45:08.040
Thanks. Have a nice day.

45:13.253 --> 45:15.839
Hey! Hey, there you are.

45:17.383 --> 45:18.884
Hey, there.

45:19.468 --> 45:23.180
Forrest J. Ackerman, Internal Revenue
Service, Wire Fraud Investigation Unit.

45:23.389 --> 45:24.390
Yes?

45:24.473 --> 45:29.061
Now, young lady, you realise this system
of money transfer you're participating in

45:29.144 --> 45:32.356
circumvents about 18 different
United States banking regulations?

45:33.357 --> 45:35.275
- I'm not sure I understand.
- Relax.

45:35.609 --> 45:38.487
It's not you that's facing jail time.
At least I don't think so.

45:38.570 --> 45:42.491
These hawaladars are known to prey on
unsuspecting illegal immigrants.

45:42.699 --> 45:45.077
- I'm not illegal.
- We don't have to get into that.

45:45.160 --> 45:46.995
- I have a student visa.
- With you?

45:47.204 --> 45:48.330
At home.

45:48.414 --> 45:50.874
See, it's supposed to be
with you at all times.

45:50.958 --> 45:53.544
Yeah, you leave it at home,
that's a good way to get yourself deported.

45:53.627 --> 45:56.088
But we don't have to go down to Immigration
and talk about that now.

45:56.171 --> 45:59.007
That's totally unnecessary.
We need to settle it right here.

45:59.091 --> 46:02.928
I just need to see the envelope
the hawaladar gave you. Please.

46:05.222 --> 46:06.682
I don't understand.

46:07.558 --> 46:08.934
What don't you understand?

46:09.017 --> 46:14.648
Why someone who says he's an IRS agent has
a New York City police detective's badge.

46:18.193 --> 46:19.820
Come over here.

46:20.028 --> 46:21.405
Okay.

46:22.823 --> 46:25.200
What are you doing? Let me go!

46:25.826 --> 46:27.286
Okay, smarty-pants.

46:28.579 --> 46:30.747
You know what the HR shrink said I have?

46:31.540 --> 46:33.375
Impulse control issues.

46:35.002 --> 46:37.588
Like you need a college degree
to figure that out.

46:37.671 --> 46:41.091
I'm telling you this so you know
that it's in your best interest

46:41.175 --> 46:43.469
not to lie to me or waste my time,

46:43.552 --> 46:45.846
but give me the goddamn envelope.

46:45.929 --> 46:49.641
Please. Before I lose my shit
and rip your throat out.

46:49.892 --> 46:51.226
Clear enough?

46:53.854 --> 46:55.147
What's that?

47:01.487 --> 47:03.155
What did you do?

47:10.370 --> 47:12.080
Damn it. Damn it.

47:14.041 --> 47:15.083
Hey!

47:15.918 --> 47:17.211
Excuse me!

47:17.294 --> 47:18.921
Messenger guy!

47:19.004 --> 47:22.132
That envelope you just picked up?
I'm gonna have to ask for that back.

47:25.260 --> 47:26.929
What are you doing here?

47:27.012 --> 47:28.555
- What is up with you?
- Nothing.

47:28.639 --> 47:30.265
Well, that doesn't look like nothing.

47:30.349 --> 47:32.434
It's my problem. It's personal.

47:32.518 --> 47:34.520
Did that cop find you?

47:35.103 --> 47:36.605
You saw him?

47:37.397 --> 47:38.732
What did you tell him?

47:38.815 --> 47:41.693
He said there were some people planning to
rob you and he was trying to stop it.

47:41.777 --> 47:43.320
He wanted to help you.

47:43.403 --> 47:46.240
- Yes, he helped me very much.
- What's going on?

47:46.406 --> 47:48.992
- You're no friend. We are not friends.
- Yes, we are.

47:49.159 --> 47:52.037
I told you one thing,
and you almost ruined it all.

47:52.120 --> 47:53.455
I'll take care of myself.

47:53.622 --> 47:57.459
Nima. You gotta start trusting somebody.
Please, tell me.

47:58.377 --> 47:59.962
What's going on?

48:03.924 --> 48:06.051
Wilee? What are you doing here?

48:06.134 --> 48:07.219
Nima.

48:07.302 --> 48:08.845
You can't have delivered already,
it's not possible.

48:08.929 --> 48:10.681
You know what? It's really uncool
to let a messenger service

48:10.764 --> 48:12.266
deliver your illegal bullshit.

48:12.349 --> 48:13.892
- Where is my envelope?
- It's hard enough out there.

48:13.976 --> 48:17.062
- Where is it?
- I gave it back to the front desk.

48:22.818 --> 48:25.195
Did a messenger just come by
and drop off an envelope?

48:25.279 --> 48:27.322
Yeah, and another one
just came and picked it up.

48:30.158 --> 48:31.368
Who told them to change the address?

48:53.056 --> 48:54.266
Hey.

48:55.350 --> 48:56.602
You get your envelope back?

48:58.312 --> 48:59.688
Someone else come and pick it up?

49:01.523 --> 49:03.442
But it's going to the wrong place.

49:03.525 --> 49:04.610
What?

49:05.235 --> 49:06.278
Why?

49:06.361 --> 49:07.529
What do you care?

49:26.298 --> 49:29.009
So, what was that thing I was carrying?

49:29.343 --> 49:33.055
It's like a receipt for
a great deal of money.

49:34.640 --> 49:36.266
What's the money for?

49:36.433 --> 49:38.560
A <i>she-tou</i>. A snakehead.

49:39.061 --> 49:41.563
- What's that?
- It's a kind of importer.

49:42.648 --> 49:47.235
Right. So you're involved
in some kind of drug thing?

49:48.487 --> 49:49.571
No.

49:50.072 --> 49:52.074
What are you "importing"?

49:55.702 --> 49:56.870
My son.

49:58.413 --> 50:02.584
I came to this country on a student visa.
He was to come right after me.

50:03.126 --> 50:05.921
It is not illegal. He
can travel on my visa.

50:06.588 --> 50:10.842
But then an article I wrote about Tibet
a long time ago was posted on the Internet.

50:12.594 --> 50:15.931
For the past years
they have not let him leave China.

50:18.100 --> 50:20.894
So I have to get him out another way.

50:20.977 --> 50:22.729
Because I will have my son.

50:27.901 --> 50:29.945
Why'd you have to go and ask for me?

50:31.071 --> 50:34.449
Vanessa always said you was the best
at what you do.

50:35.117 --> 50:36.827
She says maybe she can never count on you,

50:36.952 --> 50:40.122
but at work, there's no one better.

50:40.789 --> 50:42.416
She said that?

50:42.791 --> 50:44.126
Is it true?

50:45.544 --> 50:47.295
Can I count on you?

50:51.258 --> 50:52.718
Let me see the name on the sheet.

50:58.807 --> 51:01.268
How come you don't answer my calls?

51:01.351 --> 51:03.562
Because I got a business to run.
What do you want?

51:03.645 --> 51:07.566
You picked up an envelope from Nima
at the college office at 5:30. Where is it?

51:07.649 --> 51:08.942
Jesus, what is it with this envelope?

51:09.025 --> 51:11.653
People love it, they hate it, they gotta
have it, they gotta get rid of it.

51:11.737 --> 51:13.405
It's like cigarettes or Democrats.

51:13.488 --> 51:15.115
Where is the opener?

51:15.198 --> 51:16.366
Who's got it, Raj?

51:16.491 --> 51:19.411
Your boy Wilee pussied out.
He said he was taking it back.

51:19.494 --> 51:20.871
So it's back at the school?

51:20.954 --> 51:23.915
Negativo. Somebody called to
change the drop-off address.

51:23.999 --> 51:26.877
Why are there a million tools in here
and nothing to open a beer?

51:26.960 --> 51:29.337
- A man or a woman?
- That would be a dude.

51:29.421 --> 51:30.839
So who's gonna pick it up?

51:30.922 --> 51:32.424
I gave it to Manny.

51:32.507 --> 51:33.592
Shit.

52:07.501 --> 52:10.670
Which way are you going,
you roided-out freak?

52:25.227 --> 52:26.478
Really?

52:30.232 --> 52:31.274
Hey, where are you?

52:31.358 --> 52:33.527
Corner of Broadway and Kiss My Ass.
What do you want?

52:33.610 --> 52:35.153
Need that envelope you just got.

52:35.237 --> 52:36.321
<i>Oh, do you really?</i>

52:36.404 --> 52:38.240
Yeah, seriously. You don't know what it is.

52:38.323 --> 52:40.575
I know exactly what it is,
50 bucks if I get it there by 7:00.

52:41.034 --> 52:43.161
What, you're getting 50?
Raj is only giving me 30!

52:43.245 --> 52:44.704
Yeah, speed costs money, pussy!

52:44.996 --> 52:47.249
Pull over and give it to me, man!
I'll explain later.

52:47.332 --> 52:50.252
Okay, pussy, I'll wait right here.
There, I just stopped at 112th.

52:52.170 --> 52:54.589
Bullshit, dude, I can hear the wind.
You're still moving.

52:54.673 --> 52:58.510
Yeah, Manny rides fast!
You should try it, it feels good!

52:59.052 --> 53:01.096
Hello? Asshole!

53:03.348 --> 53:04.975
<i>- Wilee?</i>
- Now you want to talk?

53:05.058 --> 53:06.560
This whole thing is my fault.

53:06.852 --> 53:09.729
You're hard to keep track of.
I accept your apology. Can I call you back?

53:09.813 --> 53:12.607
That envelope Nima gave you is for her kid.
She has a kid.

53:12.774 --> 53:14.943
- I know. I just talked to her.
<i>- Well, do you still have it?</i>

53:15.110 --> 53:17.696
I'm chasing it down Broadway right now.
I really gotta call you back.

53:17.779 --> 53:20.782
Manny is taking it to the wrong people.
I tried to call him, but he won't pick up.

53:20.949 --> 53:22.450
I'm on it. I'll get him.

53:22.534 --> 53:24.828
No, it's my fault.
You don't need to get involved.

53:24.953 --> 53:28.331
- Well, it's on my way home anyway.
<i>- Just tell me where you are.</i>

53:28.415 --> 53:31.167
Baby, this situation sucks.
I don't want you anywhere near it.

53:31.251 --> 53:34.337
Hey, Jersey,
you wanna move your fat-ass SUV!

53:34.629 --> 53:36.548
You know how sexy you are
when you talk like that?

53:36.631 --> 53:38.300
<i>- Wilee.</i>
- I'll call you when I deliver.

53:38.550 --> 53:40.719
- Wait!
- Count on it.

53:43.889 --> 53:44.890
Shit.

53:59.738 --> 54:02.657
Hey, Wilee, I got an idea.
Why don't you race me for it?

54:02.782 --> 54:05.702
<i>You get to 28th Street before I do,
I'll give you the envelope.</i>

54:05.785 --> 54:07.579
<i>We'll go through the park. Enter on 106.</i>

54:07.662 --> 54:09.372
I don't have time for this bullshit, man.

54:09.456 --> 54:10.624
You don't got the legs for it, man.

54:10.707 --> 54:13.043
And that steel pig you're riding
ain't gonna help you neither.

54:13.126 --> 54:16.129
Be like me, baby.
Parlee, custom-cut carbon fibre!

54:16.296 --> 54:17.505
I am begging you.

54:17.672 --> 54:19.507
My bike fits me like a Naturalamb, son.

54:19.633 --> 54:20.967
Just listen for one second.

54:21.051 --> 54:22.093
See you in the park.

54:22.177 --> 54:23.428
- Manny!
<i>- Peace!</i>

54:23.511 --> 54:24.971
God damn it.

54:27.766 --> 54:30.936
Okay. You wanna race, let's race.

54:53.875 --> 54:55.168
Dispatch.

54:55.251 --> 54:57.671
Raj, I need that address
you sent Manny to right now.

54:57.754 --> 55:00.173
Manny? Come on.
Don't the three of you ever get tired

55:00.256 --> 55:02.050
of this <i>Real World</i> shit you keep playing?

55:02.175 --> 55:03.259
Raj!

55:03.343 --> 55:05.720
Manny, Wilee, Wilee, Manny.

55:06.304 --> 55:08.723
When does Raj get to climb Mount Vanessa?

55:08.848 --> 55:10.892
The address, God damn it!

55:11.351 --> 55:13.228
Hold on, let me look for it.

55:16.189 --> 55:17.649
Piece of shit.

55:31.871 --> 55:33.123
Fellas.

55:35.333 --> 55:36.501
Manny!

55:36.710 --> 55:38.420
I'll give you the 50 bucks!

55:38.503 --> 55:41.131
Manny can't hear you,
Manny's moving too fast.

55:41.256 --> 55:43.800
Come on, man, you don't wanna drag
your hefty ass up this hill.

55:45.927 --> 55:49.014
Not a problem for me, baby.
I'll just drop into my little ring.

55:54.936 --> 55:57.939
Hey, Fixie, I bet you wish you
had gears now, don't you?

56:11.703 --> 56:14.205
Gravity, you is my friend again, baby.

56:30.638 --> 56:33.224
Hey, Wilee, I got something for ya!

56:34.309 --> 56:36.061
You like that, huh?

56:36.227 --> 56:38.438
Yeah, I know you do, you little bitch.

57:02.462 --> 57:05.465
I got you, Spandex! I'm on your wheel!

57:08.384 --> 57:10.804
I'm in your draft, dude!
It's like you're on my team!

57:10.887 --> 57:14.099
- Slow down! Hey.
- Guys, get off of the path!

57:15.642 --> 57:18.103
21 dispatch. 21 dispatch, come in.

57:18.770 --> 57:20.355
2-1, bike post 3, you on the air?

57:20.522 --> 57:22.190
Yeah, this is Roselli. Go ahead.

57:22.357 --> 57:24.776
<i>Your bike freak. Beat-up white bike,
red shin?</i>

57:24.859 --> 57:25.902
Yeah?

57:25.985 --> 57:28.363
He's at it again. Park Drive,
headed south towards 7th.

57:28.446 --> 57:29.739
I'm on it.

57:34.119 --> 57:36.162
Careful on the path, ma'am.

57:38.331 --> 57:39.999
Dude, when's the race starting?

58:11.030 --> 58:14.367
People, please! Stay awake! Stay alive!

58:17.745 --> 58:19.914
Look out! Look out!

58:28.923 --> 58:29.924
God!

58:33.970 --> 58:35.054
That one hurt.

59:16.221 --> 59:17.889
You're too slow!

59:45.833 --> 59:47.168
Give it up!

59:49.921 --> 59:51.297
NYPD!

59:53.466 --> 59:55.677
Stop the bikes! Both of you!

01:00:09.274 --> 01:00:10.441
Back it up!

01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:19.492
You're such an asshole!

01:00:20.326 --> 01:00:21.661
Screw you, Wilee!

01:00:38.553 --> 01:00:41.014
Billy, pull forward! Pull forward!

01:00:41.556 --> 01:00:42.557
Hey!

01:00:56.154 --> 01:00:58.197
Who the hell are you guys?

01:01:00.575 --> 01:01:01.617
Damn!

01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:04.746
Is that it?

01:01:05.747 --> 01:01:07.582
No! Gimme that! Gimme! No!

01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:09.000
Look at you.

01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:11.961
You have got to be kidding me!
Come here! Come here!

01:01:17.884 --> 01:01:20.720
Hey, what happened to you here?
You use that goddamn brake again?

01:01:20.803 --> 01:01:22.138
Yeah, I took that shit off.

01:01:24.557 --> 01:01:25.808
Thank you, Jesus.

01:01:25.892 --> 01:01:27.060
Hey!

01:01:27.393 --> 01:01:29.062
Them! Them!

01:01:29.145 --> 01:01:30.188
This way, this way.

01:01:41.366 --> 01:01:42.533
Shit!

01:01:49.457 --> 01:01:50.625
What are you doing?

01:01:52.293 --> 01:01:53.544
Looking for the thing.

01:01:53.628 --> 01:01:54.754
Here it is.

01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:59.175
Roll this up. Really tight, really tight.

01:01:59.258 --> 01:02:00.676
Okay. Shit.

01:02:02.303 --> 01:02:03.596
I mean, holy shit, right?

01:02:03.763 --> 01:02:04.806
I know.

01:02:04.972 --> 01:02:06.099
Is it good?

01:02:06.224 --> 01:02:07.517
Yeah.

01:02:11.145 --> 01:02:12.397
Come on, guys.

01:02:12.897 --> 01:02:14.148
Come on!

01:02:14.232 --> 01:02:15.316
Hey!

01:02:15.817 --> 01:02:16.859
No, you don't.

01:02:23.658 --> 01:02:24.826
Oh, shit.

01:02:25.493 --> 01:02:26.661
Wilee!

01:02:45.847 --> 01:02:46.973
Shit.

01:02:56.649 --> 01:02:58.776
<i>Wilee? Aren't you afraid
you're gonna get killed?</i>

01:02:58.860 --> 01:02:59.861
<i>You believe in luck.</i>

01:02:59.944 --> 01:03:01.696
<i>When your number's up, your number's up.</i>

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:05.032
<i>Aren't you afraid you're gonna get killed?
I mean, the way you ride.</i>

01:03:05.116 --> 01:03:06.492
<i>Wilee! Wilee!</i>

01:03:08.494 --> 01:03:10.538
Aren't you afraid you're gonna get killed?

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:13.458
Yeah, but if it comes,
that's just gonna come outta nowhere.

01:03:13.541 --> 01:03:17.920
Am I afraid? Sure, but that's part of it,
you know? There's no feeling like that.

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:19.964
When your number's up, your number's up.

01:03:20.548 --> 01:03:23.718
- You could say that.
- So you're a Buddhist, then.

01:03:25.678 --> 01:03:28.055
<i>Yo, give it up for Sleigh Bells!</i>

01:03:28.473 --> 01:03:30.933
<i>That's what's up, that's what's up!
Sleigh Bells, yo!</i>

01:03:31.017 --> 01:03:32.101
You believe in luck.

01:03:32.185 --> 01:03:34.145
You know it's the Taoists
that believed in luck.

01:03:34.228 --> 01:03:37.773
The Buddha rejected all that.
He insisted on cause and effect.

01:03:38.149 --> 01:03:39.817
What kind of bike messenger are you?

01:03:40.568 --> 01:03:43.654
The kind with a Masters
in Bullshit and Obfuscation.

01:03:45.406 --> 01:03:47.825
You still haven't answered
my original question.

01:03:47.909 --> 01:03:50.745
Aren't you afraid of dying?
I mean, the way you ride.

01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:51.996
You wanna know what scares me

01:03:52.079 --> 01:03:54.540
is what happened to my friends
who just got out of law school.

01:03:54.624 --> 01:03:57.126
That is collective insanity.

01:03:57.376 --> 01:04:00.421
Compared to that, going down Broadway
at 50 with no brakes is fine.

01:04:00.505 --> 01:04:01.506
Sounds good.

01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:03.049
It also sounds like bullshit.

01:04:03.508 --> 01:04:06.344
The bike wants to go fast.
It's steadier that way.

01:04:06.427 --> 01:04:11.390
I've never been hurt going all-out.
It's just the hesitation that'll kill you.

01:04:11.933 --> 01:04:14.685
So you're one of those guys. No brakes.

01:04:14.769 --> 01:04:16.103
No, I hate brakes.

01:04:16.437 --> 01:04:18.147
Brakes are death.

01:04:23.277 --> 01:04:24.695
<i>Now it's time to announce the winner</i>

01:04:24.779 --> 01:04:28.449
<i>of the Fifth Annual New York
Bike Messenger Association Alleycat Race.</i>

01:04:28.533 --> 01:04:31.786
<i>Grand prize is $100 and Felipe's bike.</i>

01:04:33.538 --> 01:04:34.956
<i>You like that?</i>

01:04:35.957 --> 01:04:39.544
<i>To the winner for the
third consecutive year,</i>

01:04:39.627 --> 01:04:41.712
<i>the original bumper surfer,</i>

01:04:42.129 --> 01:04:45.299
<i>the Coyote Man, Wilee!</i>

01:04:46.133 --> 01:04:49.220
Wilee! That's my boy, right there!
All right, baby!

01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:50.930
<i>Well, come on. Come and get it.</i>

01:04:51.556 --> 01:04:52.640
<i>Get up here.</i>

01:04:55.935 --> 01:04:57.895
<i>Give it up, give it up!</i>

01:04:57.979 --> 01:04:58.980
Yeah!

01:05:00.273 --> 01:05:01.524
You back?

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:03.818
Where's my bike?

01:05:03.985 --> 01:05:05.236
Yeah, you're back.

01:05:05.653 --> 01:05:07.280
- Where's my bike, seriously?
- Relax. Relax.

01:05:07.405 --> 01:05:08.698
I can't leave without the bike.

01:05:08.823 --> 01:05:10.408
- I'm going with him.
- No.

01:05:10.491 --> 01:05:11.909
- What the hell are you doing?
- You stay here.

01:05:11.993 --> 01:05:13.828
Hey, I need some help over here.
This woman is unruly.

01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:14.996
- What?
- Calm down.

01:05:15.079 --> 01:05:16.998
- I didn't even do anything.
- You got to relax.

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:18.165
Fine. Okay.

01:05:18.249 --> 01:05:19.834
Is this my bag? Thank
you, I appreciate that.

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:22.378
Hopefully there's nothing missing.
This crazy man...

01:05:22.503 --> 01:05:25.089
I don't care what happened!
Because you tackled me!

01:05:25.172 --> 01:05:28.551
- I didn't mean to tackle you.
- Just FYI, there's a lawsuit happening.

01:05:28.634 --> 01:05:32.597
I'm not saying I'm gonna do it or whatnot,
but there is one coming. Thank you.

01:05:34.557 --> 01:05:36.767
All right, come on. Get your stuff.

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:38.436
Hey, chief, I need to talk to you.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.398
- Hey, what's up?
- I need to talk to you.

01:05:42.481 --> 01:05:45.151
- Did he come to?
- Yeah. He's awake. A little messed up.

01:05:45.234 --> 01:05:46.902
He's got a couple of bruised ribs,
but he'll be all right.

01:05:46.986 --> 01:05:49.030
- Listen, I gotta ask you a favour.
- Yeah, shoot.

01:05:49.113 --> 01:05:50.865
I have got to talk to this guy right away.

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:52.116
V?

01:05:53.451 --> 01:05:54.702
The bike.

01:05:57.038 --> 01:05:59.624
His partner got away.
I gotta find him before he gets too far.

01:05:59.707 --> 01:06:01.917
Is there any way I could ride
and ask him a couple of questions?

01:06:02.001 --> 01:06:03.127
- What, right now?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:05.630
If I could just sit with him
on the way to the hospital?

01:06:05.713 --> 01:06:06.797
- That's very unusual.
- Oh, yeah?

01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:09.925
- Yeah.
- Well, NYPD needs a favour. Okay?

01:06:10.176 --> 01:06:11.469
Okay, chum?

01:06:11.552 --> 01:06:13.846
- All right, come and ride with us.
- All right. Thanks.

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:18.225
Drive.

01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:20.895
Hey, buddy? Hey, buddy? Hey...

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:23.481
They're not your buddies.
You're one of these bike assholes.

01:06:23.564 --> 01:06:26.067
You know how much time they waste
scraping you shitheads off the street?

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:28.235
This whole city hates you.

01:06:33.366 --> 01:06:36.077
Hey, man. You headed to the impound?

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.495
Yeah. Why?

01:06:37.578 --> 01:06:40.081
Good. Take this thing. I'll meet you there.

01:06:40.164 --> 01:06:43.250
When this asshole comes for his bike,
he's mine.

01:06:51.884 --> 01:06:53.427
Time to quit dicking around, son.

01:06:53.511 --> 01:06:56.263
You got involved
with some people with real problems.

01:06:56.347 --> 01:06:58.933
Real deadlines. Life and death shit.

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:01.018
What is this to you?

01:07:01.102 --> 01:07:03.646
What, the slope that gave you the ticket,
she gave you some sad story?

01:07:03.771 --> 01:07:06.148
Eighteen cousins in Fujian
that wanna come to Chinatown,

01:07:06.232 --> 01:07:08.651
dish out Mongolian beef with snow peas?

01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:11.737
Well, life's hard. Turns
out they can't come.

01:07:11.821 --> 01:07:13.322
It's for her kid, man.

01:07:14.657 --> 01:07:17.159
Do I bother her with my problems?

01:07:18.619 --> 01:07:19.745
Where's the ticket?

01:07:26.544 --> 01:07:30.214
Yeah, I hear you got some cracked ribs,
that's gotta sting.

01:07:32.258 --> 01:07:33.426
We better be careful.

01:07:33.509 --> 01:07:36.470
Don't want you bouncing around
too much in here. Might poke a lung.

01:07:38.139 --> 01:07:40.683
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that uncomfortable?

01:07:40.975 --> 01:07:42.226
Douche bag.

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:44.228
I don't really care much
for that term "douche bag."

01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:47.273
People throw it around like crazy
these days, like it's suddenly okay.

01:07:47.356 --> 01:07:49.191
You know what else people say now?
"Suck it."

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:52.862
I was watching TV the other night, 8:30,
middle of prime time.

01:07:52.945 --> 01:07:55.322
Kids could be watching.
Guy says, "Suck it."

01:07:55.406 --> 01:07:57.450
Everybody's laughing.

01:07:57.533 --> 01:07:59.410
How is that appropriate?

01:08:00.411 --> 01:08:01.996
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:04.999
And you're gonna give me
one-word answers,

01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:06.417
yes or no.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.711
Even a bagboy should be
able to handle that.

01:08:08.794 --> 01:08:11.172
First question.
Do you know where the ticket is?

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.341
Hello!

01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:42.495
You better give me an answer or I'm
gonna snap your ribs like toothpicks.

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:49.042
Do you know where the ticket is?

01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:52.462
Will you give it to me?

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:55.966
Good boy.

01:08:56.509 --> 01:08:57.968
Just get me my bike.

01:08:58.051 --> 01:08:59.595
Are you negotiating?

01:08:59.678 --> 01:09:01.764
Yeah. Yeah, and you're outta time.

01:09:01.846 --> 01:09:03.015
You might have these assholes in the bag,

01:09:03.098 --> 01:09:05.475
but you can't lean on me like this
when we get to the hospital.

01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:07.353
That's my offer! Get me my bike!

01:09:07.853 --> 01:09:09.522
I'll get you the ticket.

01:09:10.648 --> 01:09:11.899
How do we make that happen?

01:09:12.066 --> 01:09:14.151
Manny. Bring me Manny.

01:10:09.206 --> 01:10:11.041
How ya doing, George?

01:10:29.727 --> 01:10:31.979
Charlie, pull up to the side!

01:10:34.481 --> 01:10:36.233
Put it back there?

01:10:36.317 --> 01:10:37.818
Yeah, I'm pushing it through.

01:10:37.902 --> 01:10:39.111
Shit.

01:11:01.342 --> 01:11:03.469
Get out. Come on.

01:11:05.846 --> 01:11:07.181
Here they come.

01:11:08.182 --> 01:11:10.559
I'm gonna kick your ass
till Thursday if he doesn't have it.

01:11:10.643 --> 01:11:13.228
It's in his bag.
Why do you think I was chasing him?

01:11:13.312 --> 01:11:14.939
Can I get my bike now, please?

01:11:15.022 --> 01:11:16.857
Hey. Hey, fellas.

01:11:18.776 --> 01:11:20.194
What's up?

01:11:21.445 --> 01:11:24.031
- Take this kid inside to get his bike.
- All right.

01:11:24.114 --> 01:11:26.408
- But bring him back.
- Will do.

01:11:29.787 --> 01:11:32.414
Hello, sir! Rough day, huh?

01:11:33.874 --> 01:11:35.125
Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:51.767 --> 01:11:53.477
Have to ask your permission
to search your bag.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.729
You're not in any trouble at all.
I have reason to believe somebody

01:11:55.813 --> 01:11:58.399
may have put something in there
without your knowledge.

01:11:58.482 --> 01:11:59.483
Okay.

01:11:59.566 --> 01:12:01.944
- Hey, did you just bring a bike in?
- End of the row.

01:12:02.027 --> 01:12:03.195
Okay.

01:12:03.612 --> 01:12:05.823
Hey, you see somebody
hanging on the back of my truck?

01:12:05.906 --> 01:12:07.366
No, I just got here. Like who?

01:12:07.533 --> 01:12:09.868
Like some batshit crazy messenger chick.

01:12:10.035 --> 01:12:13.247
I think she was holding on the whole time
I was on the West Side Highway.

01:12:14.999 --> 01:12:16.000
Damn.

01:12:21.088 --> 01:12:24.675
Something I've been looking for
all damn clay.

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:27.845
- I've had a bit of a rough day myself.
- What are you doing?

01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:40.065
Got it.

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:41.775
Nice!

01:12:42.109 --> 01:12:45.237
Are there any more compartments?
For what?

01:12:49.116 --> 01:12:50.409
Over here.

01:12:50.868 --> 01:12:52.453
I love you for more than one reason.

01:12:53.454 --> 01:12:55.247
God damn it!

01:12:55.956 --> 01:12:57.207
Have a nice day.

01:12:57.291 --> 01:13:00.544
Yeah, just leave it right there!
I'll take care of it, not a problem!

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.130
Shit.

01:13:10.804 --> 01:13:12.973
I'm gonna shred the living shit
outta that thing.

01:13:13.057 --> 01:13:14.266
Wait.

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:16.810
I'll see you outside.

01:13:16.894 --> 01:13:18.812
Hey! Where is the little shit?

01:13:18.896 --> 01:13:21.065
Left him back there behind the bikes.
End of the row.

01:13:21.148 --> 01:13:22.232
You left him?

01:13:22.316 --> 01:13:24.026
What, you wanted me to
watch him the whole time?

01:13:24.109 --> 01:13:27.571
No, I wanted you to give him the keys
to your car, jackass.

01:13:27.654 --> 01:13:29.281
Where'd he go?

01:13:30.657 --> 01:13:32.117
God damn it.

01:13:44.004 --> 01:13:45.506
Bastard!

01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:52.012
Can I get some help here?

01:13:57.684 --> 01:13:59.436
Go round the other side!

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.021
Outta my way!

01:14:14.868 --> 01:14:16.829
Hey! Come here!

01:14:20.332 --> 01:14:21.333
Cut him off!

01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:23.377
Jesus Christ!

01:14:24.128 --> 01:14:26.547
Hey! Close the doors!

01:14:26.964 --> 01:14:28.590
Okey-doke.

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:33.053
Come on.

01:14:35.722 --> 01:14:39.017
Hey, somebody stop her!
The girl on the bike!

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.894
Come on!

01:14:47.901 --> 01:14:49.653
Close the doors!

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:55.742
Angus, grab her!

01:15:01.707 --> 01:15:03.125
Come on! Come on!

01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:19.725
Come on!

01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:26.106
Hey!

01:15:28.317 --> 01:15:30.152
You know what? I'm done.

01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:44.708
- Hello?
- Hey, you out?

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:48.754
Holy shit! That was the most fun
I ever had with my clothes on!

01:15:48.921 --> 01:15:50.214
You know what to tell him?

01:15:50.297 --> 01:15:51.715
I'm on it.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.082
I need a flash mob, like, five minutes ago.

01:17:53.003 --> 01:17:54.087
24/7 Delivery.

01:17:54.254 --> 01:17:55.922
- Moosey, it's Raj.
<i>- Hey, what's up, Raj?</i>

01:17:56.006 --> 01:17:57.507
I need the cavalry, bro.

01:17:57.591 --> 01:17:59.760
No shit. Where we going?

01:18:01.094 --> 01:18:02.429
Roadrunner.

01:18:02.721 --> 01:18:05.140
Thought I told you not to call me, Raj.

01:18:05.223 --> 01:18:06.475
Oh, really?

01:18:06.558 --> 01:18:08.060
Hey, it's Phoebe. Who's at the bridge?

01:18:08.769 --> 01:18:09.853
Cyclehawk.

01:18:10.687 --> 01:18:11.688
This is Johnny.

01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:29.915
Yeah. I got it. I got it.

01:18:31.124 --> 01:18:32.376
Well, tell him I got it.

01:18:32.459 --> 01:18:33.502
He can send whoever he wants,

01:18:33.585 --> 01:18:36.505
the Red Army, General Chow,
I don't give a hoot.

01:18:36.588 --> 01:18:38.465
Yeah, I have the money.

01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:43.637
147, Doyers Street. Cross is Pell.
Five minutes.

01:18:52.562 --> 01:18:54.648
- Check this out.
- Man! That was a fauxback.

01:19:01.321 --> 01:19:03.156
Oh, shit. Come on, I gotta go. I gotta go.

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:11.164
Time to ride!

01:19:11.998 --> 01:19:13.166
Pay heed, people!

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.086
Here we go!

01:19:50.704 --> 01:19:54.166
You know how they say, "There's enough
to go around for everybody"?

01:19:56.126 --> 01:19:57.794
There isn't.

01:19:59.379 --> 01:20:00.547
Give me the ticket.

01:20:09.973 --> 01:20:13.685
Yeah, you know the thing about these folks?
They never testify.

01:20:16.897 --> 01:20:18.773
Who's to say you didn't lunge at me?

01:20:21.234 --> 01:20:24.362
Give me the ticket.

01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:32.662
What, is that your backup?

01:20:35.248 --> 01:20:36.249
Yup.

01:20:44.549 --> 01:20:45.759
Them, too.

01:20:48.762 --> 01:20:50.430
Suck it, douche bag.

01:20:51.097 --> 01:20:52.265
Get off me!

01:20:54.726 --> 01:20:57.437
Stay the hell off me. I said stay away!

01:21:23.797 --> 01:21:25.048
Sister Chen?

01:21:26.258 --> 01:21:27.551
Delivery.

01:21:37.143 --> 01:21:38.311
Oh, shit.

01:21:45.944 --> 01:21:48.280
Yeah, what? What, huh?

01:21:48.488 --> 01:21:51.032
I'm a cop, you zipperheads.
What are you going to do?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.167
What?

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:05.130
Wait a second.

01:22:07.591 --> 01:22:09.551
Wait a second. I need a...

01:22:17.017 --> 01:22:18.351
Okay.

01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:23.356
Okay, just gimme a break.
I need to think for a second.

01:23:25.085 --> 01:23:26.127
Thank God.

01:23:36.429 --> 01:23:37.931
Are you okay?

01:24:04.749 --> 01:24:08.878
<i>I'll still take 6th Avenue at rush hour
over an office with a view.</i>

01:24:09.879 --> 01:24:13.425
<i>Might have to put on the suit someday,
but not yet.</i>

01:24:14.259 --> 01:24:17.804
<i>Fixed gear, steel frame, no brakes.</i>

01:24:22.142 --> 01:24:23.143
<i>Can't stop.</i>

01:24:26.312 --> 01:24:27.647
<i>Don't want to, either.</i>

01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:38.510
<i>Let's get this.</i>

01:25:38.676 --> 01:25:40.220
This is Joe's bike.

01:25:40.386 --> 01:25:43.473
And that's where he ended up.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.141
- That's rough.
- This is cool.

01:25:45.225 --> 01:25:47.560
I mean, kids, don't try this at home
or nothing, but, like...

01:25:47.644 --> 01:25:49.395
Seriously, let's get you to the hospital.
