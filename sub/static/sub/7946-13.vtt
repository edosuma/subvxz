07:15.042 --> 07:17.167
a passing freighter.

07:17.209 --> 07:18.560
- It sounds like they're
- speaking Russian.

07:18.584 --> 07:20.250
Ooh, I speak Russian!

07:20.292 --> 07:22.000
- (IN RUSSIAN ACCENT)
- We need help!

07:23.918 --> 07:25.522
That's not Russian, you're

07:25.523 --> 07:27.125
just doing a terrible accent!

07:27.167 --> 07:28.897
Sheesh. A crisis is

07:28.898 --> 07:30.626
no excuse to be hurtful.

07:31.792 --> 07:34.250
Give me that mic, Yakov!

07:34.292 --> 07:36.000
- Come here, you
- broke the radio.

07:36.042 --> 07:38.105
Jessie... Oh... Do you

07:38.106 --> 07:40.167
guys want to be alone?

07:42.292 --> 07:43.668
No, no, no. No, we were

07:43.669 --> 07:45.042
just, you know, going over

07:45.083 --> 07:46.313
our double Dutch

07:46.314 --> 07:47.542
routine. Good sesh.

07:49.834 --> 07:50.856
So, did you guys find

07:50.857 --> 07:51.876
the emergency supplies?

07:51.918 --> 07:53.147
Sure did. I shot

07:53.148 --> 07:54.375
off all the flares.

07:54.417 --> 07:55.542
At me.

07:56.584 --> 08:00.667
Oh, relax! I missed.

08:00.709 --> 08:02.293
Great. So, instead of

08:02.294 --> 08:03.876
signaling for help, you

08:00.709 --> 08:03.876
tried to roast Ravi.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.897
On a related note, the

08:05.898 --> 08:07.876
fire extinguisher works.

08:07.918 --> 08:09.668
Well, I just want you

08:09.669 --> 08:11.417
guys to know we have

08:07.918 --> 08:11.417
everything under control,

08:11.459 --> 08:12.938
and we will all be saved in

08:12.939 --> 08:14.417
no time. Right, Bertram?

08:14.459 --> 08:15.626
We're all gonna

08:15.627 --> 08:16.792
die! (SOBBING)

08:18.083 --> 08:20.000
- Some of us
- sooner than others.

08:22.042 --> 08:23.959
Okay, I have locked off the

08:23.960 --> 08:25.876
steering wheel, so at

08:22.042 --> 08:25.876
least we're headed straight.

08:25.918 --> 08:27.834
- Straight for what,
- I have no idea.

08:27.876 --> 08:28.960
Now, let's divide

08:28.961 --> 08:30.042
up the food.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.334
Well, this should hold

08:31.335 --> 08:32.583
me over until dinner.

08:32.626 --> 08:34.208
Wrong! This is all the food we

08:34.210 --> 08:35.792
have until we get rescued.

08:35.833 --> 08:37.417
We need to share.

08:37.458 --> 08:38.668
Emma, you're in charge

08:38.669 --> 08:39.876
of rationing saltines.

08:39.918 --> 08:41.272
Great. Instead of starting my

08:41.273 --> 08:42.626
career as a fashion designer,

08:42.667 --> 08:44.043
I'm stuck here

08:44.044 --> 08:45.417
being a cracker cop.

08:45.459 --> 08:46.459
Thanks a

08:46.460 --> 08:47.460
lot, Jessie.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.668
Jessie Prescott, crushing

08:48.669 --> 08:49.834
dreams since 2010.

08:51.417 --> 08:53.334
- I think I should
- get extra food.

08:53.375 --> 08:54.564
After all,

08:54.565 --> 08:55.751
I am the cutest.

08:55.792 --> 08:57.334
In your dreams!

08:57.375 --> 08:58.688
These dimples beat

08:58.689 --> 09:00.000
those freckles any

08:57.375 --> 09:00.000
day of the week.

09:00.042 --> 09:01.876
- They do not!
- (ALL ARGUING)

09:01.918 --> 09:04.084
Siblings, siblings. This is

09:04.085 --> 09:06.250
no time to be selfish.

09:06.292 --> 09:07.376
That is why,

09:07.377 --> 09:08.459
as a last resort,

09:08.500 --> 09:09.564
when we are down

09:09.565 --> 09:10.626
to our last morsel,

09:10.667 --> 09:12.521
I am willing to

09:12.522 --> 09:14.375
sacrifice myself as a

09:10.667 --> 09:14.375
life-prolonging meal.

09:15.334 --> 09:16.647
Oh, who am I kidding?

09:16.648 --> 09:17.959
A light snack.

09:19.375 --> 09:20.668
You know what?

09:20.669 --> 09:21.959
Ravi's right.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.959
Jessie!

09:22.000 --> 09:23.647
At least wait until the

09:23.648 --> 09:25.292
crackers are gone!

09:25.334 --> 09:26.438
Not the part

09:26.439 --> 09:27.542
about eating you.

09:27.584 --> 09:29.438
Bertram would probably

09:29.439 --> 09:31.292
refuse to cook

09:27.584 --> 09:31.292
him for us anyway.

09:31.334 --> 09:32.938
"I could cook Ravi,

09:32.939 --> 09:34.542
or you could learn to

09:31.334 --> 09:34.542
cook him yourself."

09:36.709 --> 09:38.709
I do not sound like that!

09:40.542 --> 09:42.418
I meant Ravi was

09:42.419 --> 09:44.292
right about you

09:40.542 --> 09:44.292
all being selfish.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.813
Now, since you

09:45.814 --> 09:47.292
can't be trusted to

09:44.334 --> 09:47.292
be fair to one another,

09:47.334 --> 09:48.481
I will divide up

09:48.482 --> 09:49.626
the food myself.

09:49.667 --> 09:51.292
- Nobody eat Ravi
- while I'm gone.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.980
Uh, Jessie, I just

09:57.981 --> 09:59.959
want to say...

10:00.000 --> 10:01.876
- I'm sorry
- I was selfish.

10:01.918 --> 10:03.189
I appreciate that,

10:03.190 --> 10:04.459
Luke, but you're still

10:01.918 --> 10:04.459
not getting extra food.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.022
Oh, come on! It took

10:06.023 --> 10:07.542
me an hour to

10:04.500 --> 10:07.542
write that speech!

10:10.083 --> 10:11.418
Oh, Bertram, girls,

10:11.419 --> 10:12.751
I need your help.

10:12.792 --> 10:14.314
Since we have no

10:14.315 --> 10:15.834
idea how to work

10:12.792 --> 10:15.834
the ship's controls,

10:15.876 --> 10:16.960
we need to get back to land

10:16.961 --> 10:18.042
the old-fashioned way,

10:18.083 --> 10:19.375
- by harnessing
- the wind.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.042
So Luke is going to

10:21.043 --> 10:22.667
fart our way back?

10:22.709 --> 10:24.231
Hey, hand me that salami,

10:24.232 --> 10:25.751
and I'll have us

10:22.709 --> 10:25.751
in port by midnight!

10:28.083 --> 10:30.001
Just when the ozone

10:30.002 --> 10:31.918
was starting to heal.

10:31.959 --> 10:34.021
No, I meant Bertram

10:34.022 --> 10:36.083
and the girls

10:31.959 --> 10:36.083
should make a sail.

10:36.125 --> 10:38.042
- Oh, so you're saying
- I should make a sail,

10:38.083 --> 10:39.518
- Because if I'm stuck
- with these two,

10:39.542 --> 10:40.585
I'll end up doing

10:40.586 --> 10:41.626
all the work myself.

10:41.667 --> 10:42.772
Hello? If I'm good enough

10:42.773 --> 10:43.876
for Arturo Vitalli,

10:43.918 --> 10:45.643
- I think I'm good enough
- to stitch a sail.

10:45.667 --> 10:46.875
I do want most of

10:46.876 --> 10:48.083
you to survive.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.584
Let me guess,

10:49.585 --> 10:51.042
I didn't make the cut?

10:51.083 --> 10:52.292
How about you,

10:52.293 --> 10:53.500
Zuri? Can I expect

10:51.083 --> 10:53.500
you to help?

10:53.542 --> 10:55.793
Thanks, but I'm really

10:55.794 --> 10:58.042
more comfortable in

10:53.542 --> 10:58.042
a managerial role.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.709
Don't worry, Jessie.

10:59.710 --> 11:01.334
I promise to keep

10:58.083 --> 11:01.334
them on task.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.083
Jessie, you

11:05.084 --> 11:07.083
need to see this!

11:07.125 --> 11:08.584
Mmm, the squiggly lines

11:08.585 --> 11:10.042
are surrounding the dots

11:10.083 --> 11:12.042
- and the numbers are...
- Meaningless.

11:12.083 --> 11:14.959
What am I looking at?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.022
Using these charts,

11:17.023 --> 11:19.042
and a precise algorithm

11:15.000 --> 11:19.042
based on our drift speed,

11:19.083 --> 11:20.083
I have calculated

11:20.084 --> 11:21.084
our position.

11:21.125 --> 11:22.772
Man, you can even make

11:22.773 --> 11:24.417
dying at sea boring.

11:25.834 --> 11:27.751
As I was saying,

11:27.792 --> 11:29.668
we are clearly

11:29.669 --> 11:31.542
drifting farther and

11:27.792 --> 11:31.542
farther from land.

11:31.584 --> 11:33.042
And, I am afraid

11:33.043 --> 11:34.500
there is even

11:31.584 --> 11:34.500
worse news.

11:34.542 --> 11:35.605
Don't tell me,

11:35.606 --> 11:36.667
the crabs came back?

11:36.709 --> 11:39.042
No!

11:39.083 --> 11:40.542
Are you kidding me?

11:40.543 --> 11:42.000
These things are relentless.

11:44.584 --> 11:47.022
According to the radar,

11:47.023 --> 11:49.459
we are drifting right

11:44.584 --> 11:49.459
into a gigantic storm.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.042
What? Okay, okay.

11:52.083 --> 11:54.042
- We need to batten
- down the hatches!

11:54.083 --> 11:56.042
Anybody know where

11:56.043 --> 11:58.000
the hatches are or

11:54.083 --> 11:58.000
what "batten" means?

11:58.042 --> 12:00.105
Do not panic. We still

12:00.106 --> 12:02.167
have time. I have yet

11:58.042 --> 12:02.167
to hear any thunder.

12:02.209 --> 12:04.000
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

12:07.083 --> 12:08.251
Any chance at all

12:08.252 --> 12:09.417
that was one of

12:07.083 --> 12:09.417
Luke's salami farts?

12:14.751 --> 12:15.876
I hope we have enough

12:15.877 --> 12:17.000
to make a sail.

12:17.042 --> 12:18.810
- If we don't take advantage
- of the wind now,

12:18.834 --> 12:20.685
- The waves will start
- bouncing us around like...

Hey, Professor

12:24.231 --> 12:25.500
Quackington likes that!

12:25.542 --> 12:26.626
- He surfs on
- the soap.

12:28.834 --> 12:30.500
- What's the thread
- count on these?

12:30.542 --> 12:32.126
Emma, this is no time to

12:32.127 --> 12:33.709
complain about

12:30.542 --> 12:33.709
the accommodations.

12:33.751 --> 12:35.209
But I agree,

12:35.210 --> 12:36.667
these sheets are

12:33.751 --> 12:36.667
like sandpaper.

12:36.709 --> 12:37.939
No, I mean, with winds

12:37.940 --> 12:39.167
like these, we're gonna

12:36.709 --> 12:39.167
need stronger fabric.

12:44.083 --> 12:46.042
- Don't you use that
- to make clothes?

12:46.083 --> 12:47.105
Yep, my nylon

12:47.106 --> 12:48.125
couture active wear

12:48.167 --> 12:50.417
features fabric so strong,

12:50.418 --> 12:52.667
you can rappel down a mountain

12:48.167 --> 12:52.667
without looking repellent.

12:52.709 --> 12:54.000
- It'll make a
- supes cute sail.

12:56.959 --> 12:59.042
Well, good luck, you two.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.876

13:00.877 --> 13:02.667
lasso a seagull and

12:59.083 --> 13:02.667
fly on out of here.

13:02.709 --> 13:04.727
- Oh, no, you don't. If we're
- gonna get out of this,

13:04.751 --> 13:06.584
Everyone has to pitch in.

13:06.626 --> 13:07.813
Okay, but I just

13:07.814 --> 13:09.000
want to point out,

13:09.042 --> 13:10.397
you're making me

13:10.398 --> 13:11.751
do something that

13:09.042 --> 13:11.751
I don't want to do,

- while handing
- me a tiny sword.

- something.

I'll risk it.

13:24.792 --> 13:27.000
Good call.

13:34.125 --> 13:35.250
You guys okay?

13:35.292 --> 13:36.292
Yeah. Jessie is

13:36.293 --> 13:37.293
putting up the sail.

13:37.334 --> 13:38.813
It was tough, but with all

13:38.814 --> 13:40.292
of us working together,

13:37.334 --> 13:40.292
we got it finished.

13:40.334 --> 13:42.000
Wait, all of you?

13:42.834 --> 13:44.042
Zuri helped?

13:44.083 --> 13:45.563
Act a little more

13:45.564 --> 13:47.042
shocked, why don't you?

13:47.083 --> 13:48.918
See, I told you it

13:48.919 --> 13:50.751
wouldn't hurt to learn

13:47.083 --> 13:50.751
some basic life skills.

13:50.792 --> 13:52.751
- Actually,
- it hurt a lot.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.710
Needles and choppy seas

13:54.711 --> 13:56.626
don't mix.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.189
It appears as though

13:58.190 --> 13:59.709
there are several

13:56.667 --> 13:59.709
storms converging.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.417
Nobody has ever been

14:01.418 --> 14:03.083
able to record a weather

13:59.751 --> 14:03.083
event such as this.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.084
I hope everyone

14:05.085 --> 14:07.042
realizes how

14:03.125 --> 14:07.042
lucky we are!

14:07.083 --> 14:08.459
Yeah, I'll be sure to

14:08.460 --> 14:09.834
tell all my friends.

14:09.876 --> 14:11.230
Oh, wait. I can't,

14:11.231 --> 14:12.584
because I'll be dead!

14:14.709 --> 14:15.876
Speaking of,

14:15.877 --> 14:17.042
I hope Jessie's

14:14.709 --> 14:17.042
okay out there.

14:21.794 --> 14:22.876
you doing?

14:22.918 --> 14:24.918
- Oh, just using my forehead
- as a squeegee.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.959
- Someone needs
- to go help her.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.042
Uh, maybe the adult.

14:31.083 --> 14:33.042
- Hey, you're very
- mature for your age.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.439
Fine. Luke,

14:35.440 --> 14:36.626
take the wheel!

14:37.751 --> 14:39.751
I got it.

14:39.792 --> 14:41.272
The waves are coming

14:41.273 --> 14:42.751
from the northeast.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.251
Steer the boat into

14:44.252 --> 14:45.709
them or we will

14:42.792 --> 14:45.709
capsize and sink.

14:46.876 --> 14:49.792
But no pressure.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.751
Hey, this is exactly like the

14:51.752 --> 14:53.667
controls on my boat simulator!

14:53.709 --> 14:55.685
- So you know what - all these buttons
- And switches do?

14:55.709 --> 14:57.855
Yeah. Although I can't

14:57.856 --> 15:00.000
seem to find the

14:55.709 --> 15:00.000
cyborg whale harpoon.

15:02.083 --> 15:03.375
Ah! Oh!

15:05.209 --> 15:06.876
(GRUNTING)

15:07.792 --> 15:08.897
(SPITS)

15:08.898 --> 15:10.000
Okay!

15:11.918 --> 15:13.876
- Jessie, Bertram,
- great news!

15:13.918 --> 15:14.980
Luke knows how

15:14.981 --> 15:16.042
to work the controls.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.834
That's awesome! Luke,

15:17.876 --> 15:18.876
is there a way to

15:18.877 --> 15:19.876
start the engine

15:17.876 --> 15:19.876
without a key?

15:19.918 --> 15:21.459
Of course. I just need to

15:21.460 --> 15:23.000
go to the drop-down menu

15:19.918 --> 15:23.000
and select "New Game."

15:24.918 --> 15:25.959
Great, so we're pretty

15:25.960 --> 15:27.000
much still doomed.

15:24.918 --> 15:27.000
Oh...

15:27.918 --> 15:29.334
Not necessarily.

15:29.375 --> 15:30.584
The sail actually

15:30.585 --> 15:31.792
seems to be working.

15:31.834 --> 15:32.939
Indeed, it has us

15:32.940 --> 15:34.042
moving at 10 knots.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.042
- If it holds for
- another few minutes,

15:36.083 --> 15:37.501
We should be able

15:37.502 --> 15:38.918
to push past the leading

15:36.083 --> 15:38.918
edge of the storm.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.250
What...

15:42.292 --> 15:43.522
Well, so much

15:43.523 --> 15:44.751
for the sail.

15:44.792 --> 15:45.918
But Emma, that

15:45.919 --> 15:47.042
is beautiful work.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.563
Oh, thanks. I thought the

15:48.564 --> 15:50.042
red would really pop

15:47.083 --> 15:50.042
against the storm clouds.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.709
Yeah, and the yellow is

15:51.710 --> 15:53.334
a nice, cheerful...

15:50.083 --> 15:53.334
Can we focus, people?

15:57.083 --> 15:59.209
Goodbye, sail.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.085
See? This is why I don't

16:01.086 --> 16:02.918
help work on things!

16:02.959 --> 16:04.418
On the bright side,

16:04.419 --> 16:05.876
maybe Emma's design will

16:02.959 --> 16:05.876
reach Milan after all.

16:16.439 --> 16:18.000
right? Maybe that was

16:14.876 --> 16:18.000
the worst of it.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.918
- Actually, that was
- the smallest

16:19.959 --> 16:21.501
Of several enormous waves

16:21.502 --> 16:23.042
headed right for us!

16:23.083 --> 16:24.751
I am not sure

16:24.752 --> 16:26.417
this vessel can handle

16:23.083 --> 16:26.417
that sort of punishment.

16:26.459 --> 16:27.813
Jessie, tell us

16:27.814 --> 16:29.167
we're going to be okay!

16:29.209 --> 16:30.522
I can't. I don't want

16:30.523 --> 16:31.834
the last thing I say to

16:29.209 --> 16:31.834
you to be a lie.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.709
Ah, here,

16:34.710 --> 16:36.042

16:36.083 --> 16:37.563

16:37.564 --> 16:39.042
from the windows,

16:36.083 --> 16:39.042
and huddle up.

I want you to know

16:49.083 --> 16:50.292
I'm sorry for being

16:50.293 --> 16:51.500
such a jerk about Milan.

16:51.542 --> 16:52.689
I know you were just

16:52.690 --> 16:53.834
looking out for my safety.

16:53.876 --> 16:55.418
Which is a bit ironic,

16:55.419 --> 16:56.959
considering our circumstances.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.083
Well, it is!

My selfie with Reba was fake.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.000
It was taken at a wax museum.

17:29.959 --> 17:31.418
I bite my toenails.

17:31.419 --> 17:32.876
And chew them.

17:33.626 --> 17:35.918
And swallow them.

17:35.919 --> 17:38.209
And I love it.
