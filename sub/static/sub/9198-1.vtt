11:51.001 --> 11:53.336
- GUS, CHECK THIS OUT.
- YEAH.

11:53.504 --> 11:57.090
- PURE BILLY ''CATCH'' POOLER. WATCH THIS.
- OKAY.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.842
BACK,
DROP.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.261
- BACK, DROP.
- Y-YOU'RE FLICKIN' TOO MUCH.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.931
- I CAN'T GET THE FLICK.
- OKAY, WAIT. LET ME SHOW YOU.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.933
WHICH IS THE FLICK AND
WHICH IS THE DIP?

12:07.101 --> 12:09.936
IT'S IN THE WRIST.
THINK OF FLICK INSTEAD OF FLIP.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.813
- FLICK.
- FLICK, DIP.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.275
SEE, I CAN'T--I GET THE FLICK
AND THE DIP MIXED ALL THE TIME.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.610
- UH, PARDON ME.
- OH, SORRY.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.947
I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING YOU HAVE
A FISHING LURE ON YOUR KEY RING.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.365
YEAH.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.908
THAT WOULDN'T BE A DEADLY INVADER,
WOULD IT?

12:24.076 --> 12:25.368
IT IS!

12:25.536 --> 12:26.786
- YOU FISH?
- NOT PROFESSIONALLY.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.413
YOU COULD CALL ME A FRUSTRATED
AMATEUR.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.750
YOU'RE A FRUSTRATED AMATEUR.
[Laughing]

12:31.917 --> 12:34.961
- THAT'S GOOD.
- I WAS JUST KIDDIN'. JUST MAKIN' A JOKE.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.130
- IT WAS A JOKE.
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.467
WHAT ABOUT YOU TWO?
YOU'RE PROFESSIONALS, RIGHT?

12:40.634 --> 12:43.136
WELL, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THAT, IN A WAY.

12:43.304 --> 12:47.015
WE'RE SEMI-PRO. WE WON A LOT OF
FISHIN' MEDALS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.476
- NOT LATELY, THOUGH.
- WELL, SCOUT CAMP--

12:49.643 --> 12:52.687
THAT COUNTS, DOESN'T IT?
STUFF LIKE THAT.

12:52.855 --> 12:56.107
- SORRY, THE REASON I ASK IS--SORRY. SORRY.
- OH.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.319
- DO YOU MIND IF I JOIN YOU?
- NO, COME ON.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.155
THANKS.

13:02.323 --> 13:05.283
YOU SEE, MY FATHER WAS
A PROFESSIONAL FISHERMAN.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.619
- [Joe] REALLY?
- HE WAS TELLING ME...

13:07.787 --> 13:10.580
THAT HE WAS WORKING ON THE
DEADLY INVADER.

13:10.748 --> 13:14.167
YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN
ONE OF HIS LAST ORIGINAL DESIGNS.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.920
- BY THE WAY, I'M JOE.
- OH, UH, MARTIN.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.588
- HOW YA DOIN'?
- MARTIN JEFFRIES.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.673
GUS.
YEAH.

13:20.841 --> 13:24.677
- ANYWAY, ARE YOU TWO MARRIED?
- UH, YEAH, YEAH.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.555
- CHILDREN?
- NO, THEY'RE OUR AGE.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.140
- NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.558
- OH, I'M SORRY.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.685
- DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN?
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.146
- THEY ALL GET TOGETHER.
- THEY'RE GREAT KIDS, THOUGH.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.399
- SEE, FIONA AND I, WE NEVER HAD CHILDREN.
- OH, GEEZ.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.569
WHEN FIONA DIED, I SUDDENLY
REALIZED...

13:41.737 --> 13:43.988
I'D WASTED SO MUCH OF MY LIFE,
YOU KNOW?

13:44.156 --> 13:47.158
- I'D SPENT 20 YEARS BEHIND A DESK.
- THAT'S A LONG TIME TO BE SITTIN'.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.537
- YOU'RE 1 00% RIGHT.
- RIGHT, JOE?

13:50.704 --> 13:54.791
- I WAS ALWAYS JEALOUS OF MEN LIKE YOU.
- REALLY?

13:54.959 --> 13:58.211
OF COURSE, I'M CHANGING ALL THAT
NOW, YOU KNOW. MY LIFE'S DIFFERENT.

13:58.379 --> 14:02.382
LISTEN, I WON'T HOLD YOU UP. ANYWAY,
LOOK, IT WAS A REAL HONOR MEETING YOU.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.051
- HEY, THE PLEASURE'S OURS.
- YEAH, THANKS.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.470
THANKS SO MUCH.
AND GOOD LUCK WITH THE FISHING.

14:07.638 --> 14:10.014
YEAH. HEY, TRY FISHING.
YOU'LL SEE.

14:10.182 --> 14:13.476
- I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.
- ALL RIGHT. HE'S A NICE GUY, HUH?

14:13.644 --> 14:16.563
HEY, WHAT KIND OF ACCENT IS THAT?
POLISH OR SOMETHIN'?

14:16.730 --> 14:18.898
- I THINK IT'S IRISH.
- YEAH, IRISH, SCOTTISH.

14:19.066 --> 14:23.319
HERE. I'M GLAD Y'ALL DIDN'T BUY
A BRIDGE FROM THAT GENTLEMAN.

14:23.487 --> 14:26.573
WHY? HE SEEMED LIKE A NICE GUY. HE
DIDN'T TRY TO SELL US ANYTHING.

14:26.740 --> 14:30.660
- SEEMED LIKE A NICE GUY HAVIN' A TOUGH TIME.
- OH, REALLY?

14:30.828 --> 14:32.120
THE POOR GUY JUST RECENTLY LOST
HIS WIFE, YOU KNOW?

14:32.288 --> 14:33.663
YEAH.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.875
DID YOU KNOW YOU JUST RECENTLY
LOST YOUR CAR?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.418
HEY GUS, LOOK AT THAT,
THERE'S A CAR JUST LIKE MINE!

14:38.586 --> 14:39.961
JOE, THAT'S YOUR CAR!

14:40.129 --> 14:43.381
IT IS! WITH MY KEYS!
[Tires Screeching]

14:43.549 --> 14:46.718
- HEY, JOE!
- [Screaming]

14:55.895 --> 14:57.896
HOLY
SMOKES!

14:59.773 --> 15:01.608
[Woman]
IT'S SIMPLE.

15:01.775 --> 15:04.527
WHEN WE FIND THAT GUY WHO STOLE MY
MOM'S MONEY AND BROKE HER HEART,

15:04.695 --> 15:06.571
I'M GONNA KILL
HIM.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.287
- FOOD.
- WHAT--WHAT?

15:14.455 --> 15:15.872
FOOD.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.374
OH, NO. COME ON.
WE ALREADY LOST TWO HOURS.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.799
- HI.
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?

15:26.967 --> 15:31.054
OKAY. WHAT
HAPPENED?

15:31.221 --> 15:34.682
OH, WE JUST HAD OURSELVES A
LITTLE BOATIN' ACCIDENT.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.602
SOME FELLA STOLE A
CAR.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.689
- BIG MESS.
- OH, YEAH?

15:41.857 --> 15:45.401
HE DIDN'T HAPPEN TO LOOK LIKE
THIS GUY, DID HE?

15:47.905 --> 15:51.032
WELL, THAT WAS
HIM.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.910
- HE WAS HERE!
- WELL, WHEN DID HE LEAVE?

15:54.078 --> 15:56.788
- A COUPLE HOURS AGO.
- WAS HE ALONE?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.331
WHEN HE GOT
HERE.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.709
THEN HE SAT OVER AT THAT TABLE
WITH A COUPLE OF FELLAS AND...

16:01.877 --> 16:05.421
THEY CHIT-CHATTED FOR A WHILE
AND--AND HE TOOK THEIR CAR.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.219
THOSE GUYS WHOSE CAR WAS STOLEN,
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

16:11.387 --> 16:15.348
OH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY
TROUBLE FINDIN' THEM. [Laughs]

16:15.516 --> 16:18.184
[Laughs]

16:25.693 --> 16:27.694
[Joe And Gus
Panting]

16:27.861 --> 16:30.613
MY POOR CAR, GUS. MY POOR
CAR.

16:30.781 --> 16:34.367
MY POOR FEET.
HEY.

16:34.535 --> 16:38.746
[Car Horn

16:38.914 --> 16:42.041
[Boy In Car]
HEY, YOU DORKS!

16:42.209 --> 16:52.719
[Bird
Squawking]

16:52.886 --> 16:56.222
THIS TRIP AIN'T EVEN A ONE.
IT'S A FRIGGIN' ZERO.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.225
- IT COULD BE WORSE, JOE.
- HOW COULD IT BE WORSE?

16:59.393 --> 17:01.894
YOU CAN'T GET ANY LOWER THAN
ZERO, RIGHT, GUS?

17:02.062 --> 17:05.565
HEY, AT LEAST WE'RE ALIVE. WE
ALMOST GOT KILLED BY OUR OWN BOAT.

17:05.733 --> 17:09.402
MY LIFE STINKS, GUS. BUT IT STUNK
A LOT LESS WHEN MY CAR WAS IN IT.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.405
- YEAH.
- THAT CAR MEANT A LOT TO ME, GUS.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.657
I GOT MEMORIES OF THAT CAR I
CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.411
YEAH, BUT AT LEAST WE'RE GOIN'
FISHING.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.579
YEAH.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.040
- HEY, JOE?
- YEAH?

17:23.208 --> 17:26.711
I-I WAS JUST THINKIN'. SAY, 1 00
YEARS AGO WE WERE GOIN' FISHIN'.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.380
- THIS IS WHAT WE'D BE DOIN'.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:29.548 --> 17:32.467
YEAH, THINK ABOUT IT.
[Chuckles]

17:32.634 --> 17:35.303
THIS IS HOW WE'D GET OUR BOAT TO
THE WATER.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.765
SO WE CAN'T LET THAT GUY RUIN
OUR FLORIDA VACATION, EH?

17:38.932 --> 17:40.933
HEY, MAYBE YOU'RE
RIGHT.

17:41.101 --> 17:45.438
YEAH, AND 1 ,000 YEARS AGO, WE
WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE PAVED ROADS.

17:45.606 --> 17:49.609
HEY, THAT'S RIGHT, GUS. IT WOULD BE
FILLED WITH ROCKS AND EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

17:49.777 --> 17:52.111
Y-Y-YEAH. AND THE BOATS WOULD BE
HEAVIER.

17:52.279 --> 17:55.156
THAT'S RIGHT. DON'T FORGET WE GOT
THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY WOOD.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.616
THIS BOAT'S LIGHT, RIGHT, GUS?

17:56.784 --> 17:59.619
YEAH, AND GUESS WHAT, JOE? A
MILLION YEARS AGO,

17:59.787 --> 18:03.081
WE WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE WHEELS FOR
OUR TRAILER. [Laughing]

18:03.248 --> 18:06.250
AND WE WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE A FRIGGIN'
TRAILER, RIGHT, GUS?

18:06.418 --> 18:09.796
A-A-AND GUS, IF IT WAS THAT LONG AGO,
OUR BRAINS WOULD BE SMALLER.

18:09.963 --> 18:12.840
WE WOULDN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

18:13.008 --> 18:17.261
- OH, MAN, YEAH. SO, IT MAY NOT BE A TEN YET--
- YEAH.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.264
BUT IT DEFINITELY AIN'T A ZERO.
[Horn Honking]

18:20.432 --> 18:22.558
[Laughing]
HEY, HEY!

18:22.726 --> 18:25.561

18:39.159 --> 18:41.327
GUS, WHAT KIND OF KNOT DID YOU
TIE?

18:41.495 --> 18:43.496
A DOUBLE SHAMBO FIGURE
EIGHT.

18:43.664 --> 18:48.000
YOU WENT OVER, UNDER, OVER. UH, THE
SHAMBO GOES OVER, UNDER, UNDER.

18:48.168 --> 18:52.213

18:54.508 --> 18:57.009
- HI.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.095
HEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU
GIRLS TO GIVE US A RIDE LIKE THIS.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.555
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.348
- YEAH.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.684
IT'S REALLY TOO BAD ABOUT YOUR
CAR. I FEEL BAD.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.311
- WE FEEL BAD TOO, YEAH.
- YEAH. HMM.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.939
DID YOU REPORT THE CAR STOLEN?
YEAH, WITH THE DEPUTY.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.192
CAUSE THE SHERIFF WAS OUT
FISHIN'. AIN'T THAT A BUMMER?

19:13.360 --> 19:16.028
Y-YOU KNOW THE-- YOU KNOW YOUR
LICENSE PLATE NUMBER, RIGHT?

19:16.196 --> 19:18.823
THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT JOE
DOES REMEMBER. [Laughs]

19:18.991 --> 19:21.617
THAT'S RIGHT.
UH, ''JGTT542.''

19:21.785 --> 19:24.537
- WAIT, WAIT, CAN YOU--WHAT IS IT?
- ''J'' WHAT? WAIT.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.122
COULD YOU DO THAT AGAIN?

19:26.290 --> 19:27.582
MAYBE I'LL BUMP INTO THE POLICE,
AND I CAN HELP YOU.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.125
YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

19:29.293 --> 19:32.003
- THANK YOU. THAT'S NICE OF YOU.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.005
- ''J'' FOR JOE, ''G'' FOR GUS--
- THAT'S ME.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.215
''T'' FOR TUNA, ''T'' FOR
TROUT.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.676
''5,'' I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
THE FIRST TIME I TASTED BEER.

19:38.844 --> 19:42.805
AND ''42'' WAS GUS'S OLD FOOTBALL JERSEY
BEFORE HE DISLOCATED BOTH HIS KNEES.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.309
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW I HURT MY KNEES,
YOU KNOW. I SLEEPWALK WHEN I EAT RED MEAT.

19:46.476 --> 19:49.687
- SLEEPWALK?
- THAT'S RIGHT. HEY, LISTEN TO THIS.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.857
ONE TIME AT A JULY 4th BARBECUE
WE HAD--

19:53.025 --> 19:57.403
AFTER IT WAS OVER, GUS SLEEPWALKED ALL
THE WAY OVER TO THE 7-1 1 ON THE INTERSTATE.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.907
GOT WIPED OUT BY A MOTORCYCLE. ALMOST
KILLED HIM. HEY, TRUE STORY, I SWEAR TO GOD.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.909
- IT'S A TRUE STORY.
- RIGHT, GUS?

20:03.076 --> 20:04.911
- YEAH, RIGHT.
- EXCUSE US.

20:05.078 --> 20:06.913
HEY, WE'LL TALK TO YOU
LATER.

20:07.080 --> 20:11.042
[Laughing,
Whooping]

20:11.210 --> 20:13.920
HEY, HEY, YOU KNOW,
JOE?

20:14.087 --> 20:16.088
LIFE IS SO UNPREDICTABLE,
MAN.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.424
ONE MINUTE, WE'RE DRAGGIN' OUR
BOAT,

20:18.592 --> 20:21.177
NEXT MINUTE, WE'RE GETTIN' A
RIDE WITH BABES!

20:21.345 --> 20:25.348
HEY, YOU KNOW SOMETHIN' ELSE? I

20:25.515 --> 20:27.934

20:28.101 --> 20:30.061
HEY, MAYBE THEY THINK WE'RE

20:30.229 --> 20:32.355
- YEAH, YEAH.

20:32.522 --> 20:35.274
WE HAVE THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER.
WE KNOW THAT IT'S A BLUE BARRACUDA.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.944
AND IF WE SEE THIS GUY, WE'RE
GOING TO CALL THE POLICE.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.487
OF COURSE, WE'RE GONNA CALL THE
POLICE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:39.655 --> 20:40.905
OKAY.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.615
- HEY, HEY, REMEMBER THE KILLER LOOKS?
- THE WHAT?

20:42.783 --> 20:44.784
- THE KILLER LOOKS. [Mutters]
- KILLER LOOKS?

20:44.952 --> 20:48.621
OH, JOE! YOUR MEMORY'S SO BAD.
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.375
WE'D BE SITTIN' IN THE BLEACHERS
AND GIVIN' THE KILLER LOOKS...

20:52.542 --> 20:55.544

20:55.712 --> 20:57.630

20:57.798 --> 21:00.549
WHAT WE GOTTA DO IS FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO WITH THESE GUYS.

21:00.717 --> 21:04.011
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS THINKIN' OF

UH, IT WAS-- IT LOOKED MORE LIKE
A PURSE TO ME.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.244
YEAH, YEAH, HE WAS A MAN WITH A
PURSE, YEAH.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.913
