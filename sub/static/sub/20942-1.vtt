03:25.373 --> 03:30.461
<i>There were seven girls on
The Albatross</i>

03:32.338 --> 03:37.635
<i>But it's you who left
this sadness in my head</i>

03:39.095 --> 03:44.017
<i>You were seventeen
when we were dating</i>

03:45.852 --> 03:51.065
<i>It was in Augustรณw
that I first laid eyes on you</i>

03:52.734 --> 03:57.906
<i>Your name was Beata</i>

03:59.574 --> 04:04.412
<i>It's a beautiful name, my love</i>

04:10.919 --> 04:15.173
<i>Help us come ashore</i>

04:15.590 --> 04:18.384
<i>There's no need to fear</i>

04:18.927 --> 04:21.846
<i>We won't eat you, my dear</i>

04:22.430 --> 04:25.767
<i>Eat you, eat you...</i>

05:31.666 --> 05:38.840
THE LURE

06:41.736 --> 06:43.738
What are you doing?

06:56.292 --> 06:58.211
Hi there.

07:04.300 --> 07:08.096
- What's that smell?
- Beats me, boss. I got a cold.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.932
Then stay home
and don't spread it around.

07:56.352 --> 07:58.646
Mrs. Rockets, what's that smell?

07:59.147 --> 08:01.983
We're cooking in here, boss.

09:06.881 --> 09:09.717
Actually they're a friend's kids.

09:09.842 --> 09:11.844
And this is a nightclub

09:11.969 --> 09:14.972
with a liquor license
and adult entertainment.

09:15.223 --> 09:21.062
And this room is
for authorized staff only.

09:21.938 --> 09:24.482
Beat it, you two.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.235
Fine.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.370
Excuse me, boss.

09:39.247 --> 09:40.748
Here you go.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.546
Take your clothes off.

10:04.814 --> 10:06.399
Nothing.

10:06.524 --> 10:08.025
Sit down.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.867
Smooth as Barbie dolls.

10:56.782 --> 11:00.244
This is great!

11:00.995 --> 11:04.457
I have to say
you really got me this time.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.335
Are those real?

11:08.294 --> 11:10.087
Check for yourself.

11:11.339 --> 11:13.424
Sure they won't bite?

11:13.549 --> 11:15.634
They're still young.

11:16.177 --> 11:18.179
So what do you suggest?

11:20.556 --> 11:22.850
The slit in the tail?

11:27.229 --> 11:29.565
Where's it supposed to be?

11:41.702 --> 11:43.704
There it is!

11:44.747 --> 11:47.124
Thing is, they smell fishy.

11:49.377 --> 11:51.170
It's not that bad.

12:10.523 --> 12:13.901
And if they dry out and change back,

12:14.276 --> 12:17.071
just splash some water on them.

12:20.491 --> 12:24.662
No offense, but I was wondering...

12:25.413 --> 12:28.374
where'd you learn to speak Polish?

12:28.916 --> 12:31.669
On the beach in Bulgaria.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.588
That's great.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.299
Just great.

12:40.928 --> 12:45.099
Give it up for Miss Muffet
and "The Banana Song"!

13:12.376 --> 13:14.837
<i>Swinging in the sun</i>

13:16.380 --> 13:18.382
<i>And thinking lazy thoughts</i>

13:23.596 --> 13:26.140
<i>There's a noise up in the sky</i>

13:27.600 --> 13:30.394
<i>I slowly raise my eyes</i>

13:35.649 --> 13:39.820
<i>I see a jet full of businesspeople</i>

13:40.988 --> 13:44.825
<i>Packed to capacity</i>

13:45.326 --> 13:49.914
<i>While down here
there's just a carefree song</i>

13:50.164 --> 13:52.625
<i>And the lapping of the sea</i>

13:55.878 --> 13:57.630
<i>It's the banana song</i>

14:22.863 --> 14:25.407
It'll be all right...

14:30.454 --> 14:33.832
I just splashed water on them.
I didn't hurt them.

14:43.092 --> 14:44.552
Hold on.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.808
- Breadstick?
- Please!

15:33.851 --> 15:35.394
What are your names?

15:35.728 --> 15:37.813
- I'm Golden.
- And I'm Silver.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.316
"Imgolden," "Andimsilver."

15:40.441 --> 15:42.401
Very nice.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.363
They can do
backup vocals and strip.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.490
Here's an advance.

15:48.616 --> 15:51.785
Now get them
something decent to wear.

16:07.301 --> 16:09.386
<i>I'm new to the city</i>

16:09.762 --> 16:13.766
<i>I wanted to put
my best foot forward</i>

16:13.891 --> 16:20.105
<i>Change what I can change
and get their attention</i>

16:20.272 --> 16:23.192
<i>A mention, a nod
I could be soaring</i>

16:23.400 --> 16:26.362
<i>But life's gross and boring</i>

16:26.654 --> 16:31.742
<i>I walk through the city
Cars honking, polluting</i>

16:32.785 --> 16:35.204
<i>New sights all around me</i>

16:35.954 --> 16:38.999
<i>The lights, sounds, and faces
never cease to astound me</i>

16:39.166 --> 16:41.418
<i>Bright shiny neon</i>

16:42.544 --> 16:45.673
<i>Is saying this is
the best street to be on</i>

16:45.839 --> 16:49.051
<i>Hustle and bustle
Buses, people, and cars</i>

16:49.176 --> 16:52.221
<i>So exciting we're not leaving
We like it here</i>

16:58.686 --> 17:03.691
<i>The city will tell us
what it is we lack</i>

17:06.276 --> 17:09.655
<i>The city will tell us
what is it we lack</i>

17:12.116 --> 17:17.246
<i>We've chosen to live here
We want things to be clear</i>

17:17.538 --> 17:20.790
<i>The city will tell us</i>

17:21.165 --> 17:23.377
<i>What is it we lack</i>

17:24.502 --> 17:30.426
<i>There's not a dull minute
Lots of people live in it</i>

17:30.634 --> 17:33.846
<i>The tastes, smells, and pleasures</i>

17:33.971 --> 17:36.890
<i>The garbage, the treasures</i>

17:37.224 --> 17:42.855
<i>Pigeons and sirens
Horns and pylons</i>

17:43.480 --> 17:48.152
<i>Streets hot and exciting
Parks cool and inviting</i>

17:50.112 --> 17:52.781
<i>The city will tell us</i>

17:53.115 --> 17:55.117
<i>What it is we lack</i>

17:57.244 --> 18:01.457
<i>It knows for a fact
what it is we lack</i>

18:03.584 --> 18:05.711
<i>We've chosen to live here</i>

18:05.836 --> 18:08.881
<i>We want things to be clear</i>

18:16.305 --> 18:21.101
<i>Hands made filthy by dirty deeds</i>

18:22.895 --> 18:28.150
<i>Can't stand to watch it go to seed</i>

19:05.437 --> 19:09.358
<i>Want to hang out here a while
before swimming to America?</i>

19:15.364 --> 19:17.282
<i>Sure.</i>

19:22.704 --> 19:24.248
<i>Silver...</i>

19:24.915 --> 19:27.334
<i>what if you fall in love?</i>

19:30.504 --> 19:31.755
<i>Don't be silly.</i>

19:33.465 --> 19:34.758
<i>Would you eat him?</i>

19:34.925 --> 19:36.844
<i>Girls...</i>

19:37.219 --> 19:41.306
I want you to cover up a bit
when you're singing.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.684
Why that?

19:44.268 --> 19:47.145
Give 'em something
to look forward to.

19:47.688 --> 19:50.691
Remember: Give it 100%...

19:51.358 --> 19:53.527
But not 200% or 300%.

20:15.215 --> 20:18.886
- Knock 'em dead, Krysia.
- Nervous, girls?

20:22.431 --> 20:25.392
Just have fun
and let the rest happen.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.227
Follow me.

20:29.980 --> 20:32.065
Don't touch me.

20:32.733 --> 20:35.485
The next act is Figs 'n' Dates...

20:36.111 --> 20:39.865
featuring two sisters...

20:40.824 --> 20:43.410
two little mermaids.

20:49.416 --> 20:53.295
Let's hear it
for Silver and Golden!

20:57.007 --> 20:58.508
Nice, huh?

21:18.153 --> 21:20.614
<i>You were my heart's beating</i>

21:23.200 --> 21:25.452
<i>My life and spring so fleeting</i>

21:28.038 --> 21:30.457
<i>My dreams before and after</i>

21:33.126 --> 21:35.587
<i>My wind, my wine, my laughter</i>

21:37.714 --> 21:41.969
<i>After midnight in my town
the streetcars all get lost</i>

21:42.719 --> 21:46.932
<i>The night is run by demons
and the wires all get crossed</i>

21:47.766 --> 21:52.396
<i>Infernal powers fiddle with the routes
It's all in limbo</i>

21:52.688 --> 21:57.609
<i>And for some reason all the lines
end up outside your window</i>

21:58.151 --> 22:00.487
<i>You were my heart's beating</i>

22:03.323 --> 22:05.492
<i>My life and spring so fleeting</i>

22:08.120 --> 22:10.330
<i>My dreams before and after</i>

22:13.208 --> 22:15.627
<i>My wind, my wine, my laughter</i>

22:18.213 --> 22:22.843
<i>Someone asked me how you are
How's it going</i>

22:23.135 --> 22:28.306
<i>Someone with whom you're at war
Out there, longing</i>

22:28.432 --> 22:33.103
<i>Someone rushes
through the night on a streetcar</i>

22:33.228 --> 22:37.941
<i>They think they know the score
but I'm already at your door</i>

22:58.420 --> 23:00.630
<i>You were my heart's beating</i>

23:03.300 --> 23:05.635
<i>My life and spring so fleeting</i>

23:08.221 --> 23:10.348
<i>My dreams before and after</i>

23:13.268 --> 23:15.645
<i>My wind, my wine, my laughter</i>

23:30.035 --> 23:31.828
Girls...

23:32.579 --> 23:34.539
I'm so proud of you.

23:36.166 --> 23:38.877
My pretty girls.

23:40.295 --> 23:41.838
Jesus...

24:30.470 --> 24:33.473
Where did you disappear to?

24:45.318 --> 24:46.820
Golden!

24:47.487 --> 24:51.074
- Who me?
- No, Santa Claus.

25:32.324 --> 25:36.703
<i>It's been a long time
since I've felt this lonesome</i>

25:36.912 --> 25:41.041
<i>It can't be the weather
though it's pretty loathsome</i>

25:41.208 --> 25:47.547
<i>At night I get cravings
that aren't quite wholesome</i>

25:49.925 --> 25:54.262
<i>It's been a long time
since I've felt this lonesome</i>

25:54.554 --> 25:58.433
<i>It can't be the weather
though it's pretty loathsome</i>

25:58.558 --> 26:05.273
<i>At night I get cravings
that aren't quite wholesome</i>

26:07.150 --> 26:11.404
<i>Because I'm sad and so are you</i>

26:11.821 --> 26:15.533
<i>Now he's sad 'cause we're sad too</i>

26:15.825 --> 26:19.955
<i>You're all sad and they're all sad</i>

26:20.288 --> 26:24.251
<i>We're all gloomy as hell</i>

26:27.003 --> 26:31.007
<i>Bid farewell to cheerful smiles</i>

26:31.633 --> 26:35.262
<i>Dark thoughts eat me up alive</i>

26:35.637 --> 26:42.560
<i>I'm a fly facing winter
heavy, black, and sleepy</i>

26:44.354 --> 26:48.316
<i>Because I'm sad and so are you</i>

26:48.775 --> 26:52.779
<i>Now he's sad 'cause we're sad too</i>

26:52.988 --> 26:57.284
<i>You're all sad and they're all sad</i>

26:57.450 --> 27:00.745
<i>We're all gloomy as hell</i>

27:59.804 --> 28:01.723
Champagne.

28:23.495 --> 28:25.497
Hey, Silver!

28:26.206 --> 28:28.041
What the fuck?

28:28.208 --> 28:31.753
The name's Golden.
I'll be right back.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.759
You know I'm hung up on you.

28:42.555 --> 28:44.224
I love you...

28:44.891 --> 28:46.726
but don't tell anyone.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.212
Golden?

29:31.771 --> 29:33.273
Golden!

29:40.655 --> 29:43.241
Open up, Golden. I give up.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.118
You win.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.484
Silver.

30:19.611 --> 30:23.281
- Have you seen my sister?
- She didn't come this way.

30:28.328 --> 30:30.330
Have a smoke, child.

30:32.165 --> 30:33.625
Go on.

30:36.211 --> 30:38.296
I've never smoked before.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.673
That's not good.

30:44.594 --> 30:46.679
You want to have a pussy, huh?

30:52.852 --> 30:54.896
I'm shaking all over.

30:55.438 --> 30:57.982
"I'm such a shy thing."

31:03.238 --> 31:06.032
You know it'll make you
lose your voice?

32:33.536 --> 32:35.788
I have to tell you something.

32:38.041 --> 32:40.877
I really went crazy.
You were amazing today.

32:49.469 --> 32:51.596
I'm the one who's crazy.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.512
Put it in.

33:46.526 --> 33:47.777
Silver...

33:49.195 --> 33:51.322
You want me to be a girl?

33:54.992 --> 33:56.828
Don't be angry...

33:58.121 --> 34:02.125
but to me you'll always be
a fish, an animal.

34:03.626 --> 34:06.796
I can't do this,
as much as I'd like to.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.656
Darling Mietek...

34:34.824 --> 34:37.577
you'll be the world's
first four-handed bass player.

34:41.121 --> 34:42.748
Kiss me first.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.651
<i>Come watch over me closely</i>

35:11.360 --> 35:14.113
<i>Follow my every movement</i>

35:14.489 --> 35:19.118
<i>Take note of my tics and habits
Memorize all my gestures</i>

35:21.621 --> 35:24.624
<i>Be there at the right moment</i>

35:25.124 --> 35:28.294
<i>Tell me when something seems false</i>

35:28.753 --> 35:33.800
<i>Put your hand deep inside me
and drag me onto the shore</i>

35:35.468 --> 35:41.307
<i>If you do, I'll convert</i>

35:42.558 --> 35:48.147
<i>To a life not bound up with virtue</i>

35:49.315 --> 35:54.070
<i>Regain my former composure</i>

35:55.488 --> 36:00.409
<i>Learn all your secrets anew</i>

36:02.495 --> 36:04.872
<i>Come watch over me closely</i>

36:05.164 --> 36:07.333
<i>Follow my every movement</i>

36:07.667 --> 36:11.879
<i>Take note of my tics and habits
Memorize all my gestures</i>

36:13.005 --> 36:15.466
<i>Be there at the right moment</i>

36:15.800 --> 36:18.261
<i>Tell me when something seems false</i>

36:18.511 --> 36:23.182
<i>Put your hand deep inside me
and drag me onto the shore</i>

36:23.474 --> 36:27.854
<i>And if there's any time left</i>

36:28.437 --> 36:32.984
<i>I'll have another try</i>

36:34.360 --> 36:39.073
<i>At catching you off guard</i>

36:39.198 --> 36:43.703
<i>In any way I can</i>

37:27.872 --> 37:30.499
<i>That which endures forever</i>

37:33.085 --> 37:35.922
<i>Inscribed in our memories</i>

37:38.507 --> 37:40.927
<i>That which endures forever</i>

37:43.763 --> 37:46.349
<i>Inscribed in our memories</i>

37:50.102 --> 37:54.315
There you are! Come in.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.859
Next you'll be growing a tail!

37:56.984 --> 37:58.778
Want some herring?

38:13.167 --> 38:14.752
It was a cow.

38:24.470 --> 38:28.474
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

38:29.141 --> 38:33.312
Mermaids make their way
up from the abyss to the seabed.

38:33.479 --> 38:37.775
Then they use it for leverage
and swim to the surface.

38:38.234 --> 38:41.988
I give you... The Lure!

39:04.677 --> 39:07.221
<i>You come in and look me over</i>

39:09.432 --> 39:11.684
<i>You're picky and you're choosy</i>

39:14.186 --> 39:16.230
<i>They all want to be with you</i>

39:18.441 --> 39:21.485
<i>Every day of the week</i>

39:23.195 --> 39:27.908
<i>A wink like a fish scale
flashing in the depths</i>

39:32.246 --> 39:36.125
<i>So many albums
we could have danced to</i>

39:41.422 --> 39:43.799
<i>You choose a vowel A-A-A-A</i>

39:46.052 --> 39:49.055
<i>I'll have it played</i>

39:50.723 --> 39:53.142
<i>Letters spinning quicker</i>

39:55.061 --> 39:58.397
<i>Someone spiked our liquor</i>

39:59.648 --> 40:01.776
<i>Let go for a second</i>

40:01.901 --> 40:03.861
<i>Let love flow inside you</i>

40:09.033 --> 40:13.412
<i>Discover the flavor
of all that's denied you</i>

40:18.000 --> 40:20.252
<i>Holy moly</i>

40:20.419 --> 40:22.505
<i>Bitter tastes can be delicious</i>

40:22.630 --> 40:24.632
<i>So you're lonely</i>

40:24.757 --> 40:27.093
<i>Now I know that love is vicious</i>

40:27.218 --> 40:29.595
<i>Holy moly</i>

40:29.720 --> 40:31.764
<i>Bitter tastes can be delicious</i>

40:31.889 --> 40:33.891
<i>So you're lonely</i>

40:34.016 --> 40:36.435
<i>Now I know that love is vicious</i>

41:03.671 --> 41:07.800
<i>They promised frutti di mare</i>

41:08.092 --> 41:12.888
<i>Now we're feeling sorry</i>

41:13.139 --> 41:16.976
<i>I'm angry as hell</i>

41:17.351 --> 41:23.482
<i>Picking at love's cracked-up shells</i>

41:26.735 --> 41:30.531
<i>One last piece of flesh</i>

41:30.990 --> 41:35.202
<i>Lands on my plate</i>

41:35.452 --> 41:39.832
<i>Charred like some scrap</i>

41:40.374 --> 41:44.670
<i>No one wants to wrap</i>

42:05.983 --> 42:07.693
The head of entertainment.

42:07.943 --> 42:10.571
I loved your act!

42:10.696 --> 42:12.740
You were sensational!

42:45.356 --> 42:47.733
The fiends are on the scene.

43:12.258 --> 43:15.511
Don't push your luck
or you'll get a broken arm.

43:23.978 --> 43:27.481
You are my blood.
I have horns under my flesh.

43:30.776 --> 43:33.654
A fisherman broke this one off.

43:34.905 --> 43:37.116
I tore this one out myself.

43:47.835 --> 43:51.088
You're so beautiful,
and you have a great fish tail.

43:53.757 --> 43:56.051
And an amazing voice.

43:57.928 --> 44:00.222
Want to sing with my band?

44:11.817 --> 44:13.694
<i>Keep an eye on her.</i>

44:17.740 --> 44:21.869
<i>If she falls in love with a human
and he marries someone else...</i>

44:24.913 --> 44:28.751
<i>she'll turn into sea foam
before the night is out.</i>

44:50.564 --> 44:52.107
Police.

44:53.233 --> 44:54.860
Good evening.

44:55.903 --> 44:57.696
What's "police"?

45:00.532 --> 45:04.119
I can put the squeeze on you
so hard you'll gasp for breath.

45:13.045 --> 45:16.423
You ate a citizen
who was out on the town.

45:19.343 --> 45:21.261
I know nothing about that.

45:24.098 --> 45:26.850
I wasn't born yesterday.

45:29.520 --> 45:33.774
<i>Leaves are falling
like they've gone crazy</i>

45:34.066 --> 45:37.736
<i>Ravens are pecking at nuts</i>

45:39.029 --> 45:43.742
<i>The wind raises goose bumps
on the bare ankles</i>

45:43.951 --> 45:47.329
<i>Of girls walking home
from their classes</i>

45:48.038 --> 45:51.834
<i>The wind feels freezing
on my bare skin</i>

45:52.126 --> 45:55.712
<i>I just need
some warmth and comfort</i>

45:56.338 --> 45:59.967
<i>Leaves are falling
like they've gone crazy</i>

46:00.217 --> 46:03.554
<i>Ravens are pecking at nuts</i>

46:05.431 --> 46:08.559
<i>Leaves are falling
like they've gone crazy</i>

46:08.684 --> 46:12.271
<i>Ravens are pecking at nuts</i>

46:12.896 --> 46:16.525
<i>My breath condenses
in the storm of the senses</i>

46:16.859 --> 46:20.612
<i>Anxiety tugs at my elbow</i>

46:20.946 --> 46:24.867
<i>Frost and dampness
are now in motion</i>

46:25.409 --> 46:28.370
<i>Bodies swell with emotion</i>

46:29.455 --> 46:33.041
<i>Leaves are falling
like they've gone crazy</i>

46:33.250 --> 46:36.962
<i>Ravens are pecking at nuts</i>

46:51.101 --> 46:54.396
<i>Oil on your palms
Le! me hold them</i>

46:54.605 --> 46:58.108
<i>Babe, I'll take you to Disneyland</i>

46:58.275 --> 47:01.737
<i>We'll watch Paris burn together</i>

47:02.112 --> 47:04.531
<i>See fire spread in Rome</i>

47:04.823 --> 47:06.700
<i>Or in me</i>

47:12.998 --> 47:16.627
<i>You have your doubts about going out
I had a talk with Daddy</i>

47:16.752 --> 47:19.796
<i>He has no buts regarding sluts</i>

47:20.172 --> 47:23.550
<i>So what if you blew your debut</i>

47:23.842 --> 47:26.595
<i>Next time you're bound to get lucky</i>

47:27.554 --> 47:30.516
<i>Karma's like that, it can dog you</i>

47:30.974 --> 47:33.352
<i>The limelight tastes sour</i>

47:34.978 --> 47:38.398
<i>You have your doubts about going out
I had a talk with Daddy</i>

47:38.524 --> 47:41.360
<i>He has no buts regarding sluts</i>

47:41.944 --> 47:45.614
<i>Oil on your palms
Le! me hold them</i>

47:45.739 --> 47:49.034
<i>Babe, I'll take you to Disneyland</i>

47:49.243 --> 47:52.704
<i>We'll watch Paris burn together</i>

47:53.080 --> 47:56.124
<i>See fire spread in Rome</i>

49:33.639 --> 49:36.058
How come you reek of fish?

49:41.146 --> 49:43.106
I ate some herring.

49:44.066 --> 49:45.734
With your fingers?

49:46.735 --> 49:47.903
Krysia...

49:48.236 --> 49:53.367
Go and bone
those fucking fish of yours!

50:23.271 --> 50:25.107
I worry about you.

50:26.108 --> 50:27.651
Stop it.

50:32.406 --> 50:34.574
<i>Nothing in the obituaries.</i>

50:34.700 --> 50:36.785
<i>- Looking for someone in particular?
- You!</i>

50:37.202 --> 50:41.832
<i>This one goes out from an admiring
drummer to a semi-obscure singer.</i>

50:41.957 --> 50:44.501
<i>Bill Chase with "Cronus."</i>

50:44.626 --> 50:47.045
- I don't believe this.
- Stop it.

52:12.005 --> 52:13.256
<i>Good evening.</i>

52:13.965 --> 52:17.803
<i>We open tonight's program
with an exceptional case</i>

52:17.928 --> 52:20.222
<i>that occurred last week,</i>

52:20.347 --> 52:24.226
<i>when a Warsaw beach became
the scene of a gruesome murder.</i>

52:25.143 --> 52:28.313
<i>The victim's throat was ripped open
and his heart torn out.</i>

52:28.480 --> 52:30.607
<i>Missing body parts
have not been found.</i>

52:30.732 --> 52:34.694
<i>Foxes and dogs have been ruled out.</i>

52:38.198 --> 52:40.909
<i>Witnesses are asked to come forward.</i>

52:41.660 --> 52:45.872
<i>The only tracks on the scene are
of a human and something reptilian.</i>

52:45.997 --> 52:50.168
<i>If any of our viewers
has any information,</i>

52:50.293 --> 52:53.046
<i>please call our studios</i>

52:53.171 --> 52:55.632
<i>at 43-10-53...</i>

52:55.757 --> 52:58.844
<i>or contact
your nearest police station...</i>

53:02.305 --> 53:03.598
Fuck!

53:05.016 --> 53:07.769
How come we never play
volleyball together?

53:08.019 --> 53:12.816
We never roller-skate
or ice-skate or ride scooters.

53:12.941 --> 53:15.193
We can't go
to restaurants or bars.

53:15.360 --> 53:18.029
We work,
but we don't get any money.

53:19.197 --> 53:21.241
You're still kids.

53:21.533 --> 53:23.910
Kids can't have everything they want.

53:24.035 --> 53:26.204
- Brats.
- Why?

53:34.170 --> 53:36.089
I'll smack her, I swear.

54:25.138 --> 54:29.309
<i>One jellyfish, two jellyfishes</i>

54:29.726 --> 54:33.688
<i>I wanna grow up
and get all my wishes</i>

54:34.105 --> 54:37.943
<i>Three jellyfishes, four jellybeanses</i>

54:38.151 --> 54:41.613
<i>We want the plankton
scrubbing our fins</i>

54:41.821 --> 54:44.783
<i>Five jellyfishees, six jellyfishoos</i>

54:44.991 --> 54:47.619
<i>Wanna walk on the water
in my high-heeled shoes</i>

54:47.744 --> 54:49.621
<i>Seven jellyfishes, eight jellybabies</i>

54:49.788 --> 54:51.831
<i>Wanna drown in the water
and stay dead for ages</i>

54:51.957 --> 54:55.001
<i>Nine jellyfishoos, ten jellyfishus</i>

54:55.126 --> 54:57.629
<i>Give me a boyfriend
who isn't amphibious!</i>

56:28.178 --> 56:29.888
Let go of him!

56:32.932 --> 56:34.392
Leave him alone!

58:56.242 --> 59:01.915
<i>Poison</i>

59:04.959 --> 59:11.049
<i>Inside you</i>

59:14.302 --> 59:26.231
<i>That's what the smell is</i>

59:30.401 --> 59:34.530
<i>But is it done, is it done, is it done?</i>

01:00:33.881 --> 01:00:39.387
<i>It goes to your head</i>

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:48.521
<i>Noxious and nasty</i>

01:00:48.938 --> 01:00:53.026
<i>But is it done, is it done, is it done?</i>

01:01:07.999 --> 01:01:14.797
<i>I can't walk this one off</i>

01:01:17.008 --> 01:01:22.722
<i>I need my glucose</i>

01:01:25.433 --> 01:01:31.522
<i>My hair feels like viscose</i>

01:01:34.317 --> 01:01:39.072
<i>The pain's made me morose</i>

01:01:41.324 --> 01:01:45.161
<i>But is it done, is it done, is it done?</i>

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:15.710
I want to apologize...

01:03:17.253 --> 01:03:19.422
for what happened before.

01:03:21.174 --> 01:03:22.675
I'm sorry.

01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:26.971
Oh, we're not mad.

01:04:55.393 --> 01:04:56.978
Mind if I join you?

01:04:59.981 --> 01:05:02.233
Hi.

01:05:07.863 --> 01:05:10.783
I'll be getting
real legs and a pussy.

01:05:13.578 --> 01:05:16.247
You can have my tail if you want.

01:05:17.456 --> 01:05:18.958
You want it?

01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:20.960
What for?

01:05:22.461 --> 01:05:24.880
I know you want a fish tail.

01:05:27.091 --> 01:05:28.634
No, I don't.

01:05:52.867 --> 01:05:55.328
You can't talk to him now.

01:05:55.453 --> 01:05:57.788
He's getting
psyched up for the gig.

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:03.044
Are you a mermaid?

01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:04.837
We'll just see.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.406
<i>The colors keep changing</i>

01:06:32.531 --> 01:06:34.659
<i>From green to yellow to red</i>

01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:02.561
<i>Someone who never existed
walked out on me</i>

01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:21.122
<i>I'm getting up and falling</i>

01:07:21.247 --> 01:07:24.458
<i>I'm falling! I'm falling!</i>

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:28.045
<i>Don't ask where I'm going</i>

01:07:46.397 --> 01:07:49.233
Triton! Triton! Triton!

01:07:55.865 --> 01:07:58.033
You were really...

01:07:58.868 --> 01:08:00.911
You need a lot of practice.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:00.805
<i>Triton said if you out off your tail,
you'll lose your voice.</i>

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:04.725
<i>Nothing happened to him, did it?</i>

01:09:07.728 --> 01:09:12.107
<i>Silver, you have to sing.
We have to sing together.</i>

01:09:19.782 --> 01:09:22.701
<i>That's a superstition, you moron.</i>

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:37.216
<i>Try to stop me
and you'll never see me again.</i>

01:09:39.551 --> 01:09:40.845
<i>Got that?</i>

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:34.565
It's not my birthday.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.402
What can I do for you?

01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:52.124
<i>I'm bound to the bed
There's bile in the drip</i>

01:10:56.545 --> 01:11:00.633
<i>No veil, just a tube in my vein</i>

01:11:04.803 --> 01:11:13.479
<i>I'll be wheeled down the aisle
in my surgical gown</i>

01:11:13.604 --> 01:11:18.025
<i>As orderlies roll on their latex</i>

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:24.198
<i>The bedpan's bright gold
The dinner's grown cold</i>

01:11:27.117 --> 01:11:32.790
<i>And time flows like sweat
off a midwife's brow</i>

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:41.966
<i>I cheer myself up
with bitter chocolate</i>

01:11:44.426 --> 01:11:48.722
<i>Bitter chocolate makes me better</i>

01:11:52.309 --> 01:11:59.316
<i>You can always choose to walk out</i>

01:12:00.776 --> 01:12:04.196
<i>As long as you sign
the release papers</i>

01:12:06.073 --> 01:12:10.285
<i>On your own responsibility</i>

01:12:10.786 --> 01:12:16.750
<i>Your own responsibility</i>

01:13:24.193 --> 01:13:31.075
<i>You can always choose to walk out</i>

01:13:32.951 --> 01:13:36.538
<i>As long as you sign
the release papers</i>

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:43.087
<i>On your own responsibility</i>

01:13:53.597 --> 01:13:57.059
That's for you, sis.
To cheer you up.

01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:23.460
<i>So much smoke
it makes my mouth dry</i>

01:14:23.585 --> 01:14:25.712
<i>Bodies on the dance floor dancing by</i>

01:14:26.213 --> 01:14:28.507
<i>Did I catch your eye on purpose?</i>

01:14:28.966 --> 01:14:31.468
<i>I'm no rookie but I'm nervous</i>

01:14:31.677 --> 01:14:34.429
<i>Spilling smokes
my hands are shaking</i>

01:14:34.555 --> 01:14:37.141
<i>Is this the wrong step I'm taking?</i>

01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:42.396
<i>As fatal as hara-kiri
my emotions make me silly</i>

01:14:42.604 --> 01:14:45.149
<i>Hearts' magnetism pulls me in</i>

01:14:45.274 --> 01:14:47.985
<i>Don't want to fall in love again</i>

01:14:59.329 --> 01:15:01.707
<i>Just one moment and I'm reeling</i>

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.585
<i>You lit the fire of my feelings</i>

01:15:04.793 --> 01:15:07.462
<i>On this dance floor I'll dance for you</i>

01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:10.007
<i>Cheat on you but still adore you</i>

01:15:15.637 --> 01:15:17.931
<i>Hearts' magnetism pulls me in</i>

01:15:18.223 --> 01:15:21.185
<i>Don't want to fall in love again</i>

01:16:51.608 --> 01:16:53.402
Boss...

01:16:55.279 --> 01:16:58.198
Silver could lip-synch.
It'd be great.

01:16:58.365 --> 01:17:00.951
In my club?
Over my dead body.

01:17:03.912 --> 01:17:07.833
Silver, don't get me wrong.

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:10.252
Everyone loves you.

01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:13.672
I love all of you. Lots.

01:17:14.548 --> 01:17:19.803
This is hard for me,
but everyone wants duos now.

01:17:25.517 --> 01:17:27.769
We'll have Golden go solo.

01:17:30.105 --> 01:17:32.024
I don't sing solo.

01:17:45.829 --> 01:17:49.124
My whole band's sick.

01:17:49.583 --> 01:17:52.085
How are you holding up?
- Fit as a fiddle.

01:17:52.252 --> 01:17:55.422
I like that song of yours "The Fly."

01:17:55.547 --> 01:17:57.758
That one's by The Lure.

01:17:59.343 --> 01:18:01.261
Let's rock it a bit, huh?

01:18:04.389 --> 01:18:06.099
What do I play?

01:20:02.257 --> 01:20:05.844
<i>Because I'm sad and so are you</i>

01:20:06.511 --> 01:20:10.140
<i>Now he's sad 'cause we're sad too</i>

01:20:10.265 --> 01:20:13.852
<i>You're all sad and they're all sad</i>

01:20:14.394 --> 01:20:17.522
<i>We're all gloomy as hell</i>

01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:22.903
<i>Because I'm sad and so are you</i>

01:20:23.361 --> 01:20:27.365
<i>Now he's sad 'cause we're sad too</i>

01:20:27.491 --> 01:20:30.911
<i>You're all sad and they're all sad</i>

01:20:31.119 --> 01:20:35.040
<i>We're all gloomy as hell</i>

01:20:58.897 --> 01:21:01.691
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

01:21:01.942 --> 01:21:05.487
Let's hear it for the newlyweds! Kiss!

01:21:05.612 --> 01:21:08.573
The name of the band is
Ballady I Romanse!

01:21:18.667 --> 01:21:21.044
You have to eat him by daybreak.

01:21:24.172 --> 01:21:26.049
Chickadee...

01:21:29.052 --> 01:21:32.764
He's just a human.
You'll be sea foam if you don't.

01:21:34.683 --> 01:21:39.062
We're not human.
We're just on vacation here.

01:21:41.231 --> 01:21:43.400
You'll vanish into thin air.

01:21:43.525 --> 01:21:45.944
<i>Give me this night</i>

01:21:46.903 --> 01:21:49.072
<i>Just this one night</i>

01:21:50.407 --> 01:21:52.951
<i>Give me this night</i>

01:21:54.035 --> 01:21:56.621
<i>Just this one night</i>

01:21:57.747 --> 01:22:00.792
<i>In warm houses people fret</i>

01:22:01.293 --> 01:22:04.462
<i>All the stress, too much to cope</i>

01:22:04.796 --> 01:22:08.008
<i>But here hands are holding hands</i>

01:22:08.383 --> 01:22:11.219
<i>And in every glass there's hope</i>

01:22:11.803 --> 01:22:14.806
<i>We don't need that much at all</i>

01:22:15.432 --> 01:22:18.268
<i>Just to party till we weep</i>

01:22:18.977 --> 01:22:22.105
<i>Surrounded by these spinning walls</i>

01:22:22.439 --> 01:22:25.817
<i>And the rain of dancing lights</i>

01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:46.755
<i>Enjoy the fun before it's gone</i>

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.655
<i>Let's get lost and forget again</i>

01:23:11.905 --> 01:23:15.200
<i>All the times when we felt down</i>

01:23:15.408 --> 01:23:18.495
<i>There'll be time for all of that</i>

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:22.165
<i>When daylight comes around</i>

01:23:30.298 --> 01:23:31.758
Eat him.

01:26:49.372 --> 01:26:51.165
What the fuck!

01:29:11.973 --> 01:29:19.731
<i>My fingers slowly ease
their grip on your hand</i>

01:29:22.859 --> 01:29:30.992
<i>The sludge of despair
sinks to the bottom</i>

01:29:33.953 --> 01:29:36.372
<i>One thing is certain</i>

01:29:37.999 --> 01:29:46.299
<i>I'll be warmer here than in your arms</i>

01:29:48.968 --> 01:29:56.976
<i>I'll be warmer amid these weeds
and old car parts</i>

01:30:01.981 --> 01:30:08.112
<i>Than on your knee</i>

01:30:10.114 --> 01:30:19.040
<i>The undertow that drags me down</i>

01:30:23.044 --> 01:30:30.134
<i>Is gentler than your hands and lips</i>

01:30:32.595 --> 01:30:35.348
<i>One thing is certain</i>

01:30:36.682 --> 01:30:45.024
<i>I'll be warmer here than in your arms</i>

01:30:50.404 --> 01:30:55.868
<i>Now that I'm surrounded
by creatures of the sea</i>

01:30:55.993 --> 01:31:03.501
<i>Don't pretend you're sorry</i>

01:31:18.808 --> 01:31:21.727
<i>'Cause I'll be better off here</i>

01:31:24.397 --> 01:31:27.483
<i>So much warmer here</i>

01:31:29.944 --> 01:31:34.198
<i>Amid these old car parts</i>

01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:41.205
<i>Than on your knee</i>

01:31:42.305 --> 01:31:48.331
