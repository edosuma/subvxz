01:06.100 --> 01:10.013
Amazing.
The last strawberry in the universe.

01:12.500 --> 01:17.016
Calibrator locked and set.
Organic infrastructure recorded and stored.

01:17.220 --> 01:19.734
Engage the triplicator.

01:19.900 --> 01:23.336
It works!

01:23.500 --> 01:26.173
- What works?
- We've adapted the matter paddle.

01:26.380 --> 01:29.213
Now the returning signal
is split three ways,

01:29.380 --> 01:33.976
so as well as receiving the original object,
we get two identical copies.

01:34.140 --> 01:36.574
This will solve all our supply problems.

01:36.780 --> 01:38.975
Taking into account recalibration,

01:39.140 --> 01:42.655
we can produce four,
perhaps even five strawberries a week.

01:44.100 --> 01:49.572
Well, if the Nobel Prize people run
a fruit section, you're this year's hot tip.

01:50.380 --> 01:52.371
Gentlemen, history beckons.

01:52.580 --> 01:56.653
You'll be famous. They'll build statues,
even name towns after you.

01:56.860 --> 01:59.328
"Dorksville" springs instantly to mind.

02:00.340 --> 02:03.035
This machine could
revolutionise our lives.

02:03.036 --> 02:03.855
Absolutely.

02:04.020 --> 02:09.252
With this little baby, we could have
a full fruit salad by the end of the year.

02:10.539 --> 02:15.330
Look, it's not just strawberries.
It can duplicate anything. It can...

02:16.180 --> 02:18.171
Sir, what's wrong?

02:18.340 --> 02:21.855
This strawberry's incredible! So succulent.

02:22.020 --> 02:24.011
It's divine.

02:24.700 --> 02:27.578
- Is that the same?
- Oh, no, no!

02:27.740 --> 02:31.016
- How's it different?
- It's bitter, rancid.

02:31.180 --> 02:33.296
- Sir, I, um...
- Kind of tangy.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.451
- Sir, I...
- Crunchy.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.736
- Sir.
- Tangy. Kind of chewy.

02:37.900 --> 02:41.973
Meaty, even. It's a...
funny kind of wriggly texture.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.739
Oh, smeg!

02:45.940 --> 02:49.535
It's as if it extracted the best elements
from one duplicate

02:49.700 --> 02:51.816
and the worst from the other.

02:52.020 --> 02:55.330
So what would happen
if we reversed the process?

03:10.180 --> 03:14.093
Nice experiment. What do you do
for an encore? Neutron bomb juggling?

03:14.300 --> 03:16.689
Rude alert! Rude alert!

03:16.860 --> 03:20.409
An electrical fire has knocked out
my voice recognition unicycle.

03:20.620 --> 03:23.399
Many Wurlitzers are
missing from my database.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.694
Abandon shop! This is not a daffodil!

03:25.860 --> 03:28.010
This is not a daffodil.

03:29.580 --> 03:32.413
Well, thankfully, Holly's unaffected.

03:32.900 --> 03:37.655
She's right! The engine core is approaching
critical mass. Meltdown in 15 minutes!

03:37.820 --> 03:42.735
A brisk stroll towards the cargo bay
could be in order at this point.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.891
Red Dwarf's gonna blow?

03:45.100 --> 03:48.092
In less time than Norwegians take
to buy ski boots.

03:48.260 --> 03:53.812
Hey, guys! They're playing the Awooga Waltz.
Care to join me in a quickstep?

04:02.260 --> 04:04.251
Holly, open cargo bay doors.

04:04.460 --> 04:07.975
Er, Holly, those cargo bay doors
we talked about earlier,

04:08.140 --> 04:10.131
would you mind opening them, please?

04:10.300 --> 04:14.657
- Holly! The doors, Holly!
- "Cargo bay doors" isn't in my lexicon.

04:14.860 --> 04:17.089
- Manual override!
- "Manual override" isn't...

04:17.260 --> 04:19.057
Oh, forget it!

04:28.700 --> 04:32.818
That's eighty clicks. We should be clear
of any possible blast zone.

04:33.620 --> 04:36.657
- You really think it'll blow?
- This can't be happening.

04:36.860 --> 04:40.773
Nothing's gonna happen.
We're just here as a precaution.

04:40.940 --> 04:43.579
The whole ship's full of fail-safes anyway -

04:43.740 --> 04:46.777
cooling systems,
containment panels, vacuum shields...

04:46.940 --> 04:49.249
The chances of it blowing
are about one in...

04:57.100 --> 04:58.897
. one.

05:06.580 --> 05:08.571
Well, according to the charts,

05:08.740 --> 05:12.528
the nearest asteroid
with an S-3 atmosphere is six hours away.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.533
But we only have enough
fuel for five hours' flight.

05:15.740 --> 05:19.176
I don't think that's a
major problem, though,

05:19.340 --> 05:23.333
because we only have enough oxygen
for seven minutes.

05:26.940 --> 05:29.818
Well, that doesn't affect us, does it?

05:29.980 --> 05:33.370
- Sorry, sir?
- We don't need oxygen.

05:33.540 --> 05:38.295
Here's a thought. If we ejected
their corpses into outer space,

05:38.500 --> 05:41.617
would the weight reduction
help us reach the asteroid?

05:48.340 --> 05:50.410
- That's not the attitude.
- Sorry?

05:50.580 --> 05:54.368
That's not the Red Dwarf way.
One in trouble, all in trouble.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.571
- The posse.
- Boys from the Dwarf.

05:56.740 --> 06:00.289
- The homeboys always band together.
- That's the way it is.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.889
Have you got anything in writing?

06:04.740 --> 06:06.890
You're a toad, Rimmer. A weasel.

06:07.060 --> 06:10.894
You're a slimy rodent
with the morals of a praying mantis.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.809
I'm just being a realist.
You have seven minutes left to live.

06:14.980 --> 06:18.052
That's tragic. God, it's tragic!

06:18.220 --> 06:25.058
- But for the rest of us, life must go on.
- If I may interject, that's not quite true.

06:25.220 --> 06:29.736
Remember, you are operating on emergency
battery supplies. We have no spares.

06:29.900 --> 06:34.655
In fact, you yourself, sir, will expire
in a little under four minutes.

06:37.220 --> 06:39.814
. OK, homeboys, let's posse!

06:41.780 --> 06:44.533
- Right, Kryten, scan the wreckage.
- Straight away, sir.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.817
Cat, get suited up.
Maybe some oxygen tanks survived.

06:47.980 --> 06:52.735
Maybe some fuel tanks.
If we get a fix, we bring them on-board.

06:53.460 --> 06:57.578
Meanwhile, turn Rimmer down to minimum
power. It'll triple his running time.

06:57.740 --> 07:00.049
Sirs, there's something out there.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.212
Two objects, far too vast to be debris.

07:03.380 --> 07:07.009
According to the backlog,
they materialised just before the explosion.

07:07.180 --> 07:10.331
- Can we get in any closer?
- Enhance maximum.

07:14.980 --> 07:18.211
Of course. Two copies of Red Dwarf.

07:18.420 --> 07:21.651
- How?
- Presumably, in reverse,

07:21.820 --> 07:26.371
the triplicator reversed the field
of the beam, projecting it out, not in.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.538
So, instead of the strawberries,
it copied the entire ship?

07:29.740 --> 07:35.690
Precisely. Presumably, the resultant power
drain caused the original to blow.

07:35.900 --> 07:39.575
So, like the strawberries,
there are two new Red Dwarfs,

07:39.740 --> 07:41.731
one succulent and divine,

07:41.900 --> 07:44.539
- the other...
- Fish bait.

07:44.700 --> 07:49.615
So what's the problem? We got us a ship
that's better than the original.

07:49.820 --> 07:54.257
- Not quite.
- In the lab, copies had a limited lifespan.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.020
- How limited?
- About an hour.

07:57.220 --> 08:01.577
There may be a solution. The ship's contents
should be triplicated too.

08:01.780 --> 08:06.456
There will be a working triplicator on-board
whichever of the ships is superior.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.088
Theoretically, we can reverse the reversal

08:09.300 --> 08:13.373
and replicate the original Red Dwarf
by amalgamating the two copies.

08:13.540 --> 08:16.259
He makes it sound so simple.

08:25.780 --> 08:31.776
We have to find a terminal to re-boost Mr
Rimmer's battery pack. We'll catch you up.

08:37.140 --> 08:42.931
Check that music. It's magnificent!
I never heard anything like it before.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.456
Ooh!
Get a lungful of that air, man!

08:46.620 --> 08:49.498
Hmm! Makes you feel good to be alive.

08:49.660 --> 08:53.414
Everything about this ship is...
well, it's divine.

08:54.740 --> 08:56.890
Hey, let's check the food.

08:58.380 --> 09:01.770
- What did you order?
- Ultimate test - Pot Noodle.

09:05.340 --> 09:07.774
Mmm!

09:08.580 --> 09:12.732
I tell you this, I've visited a parallel
universe, seen time running backwards,

09:12.900 --> 09:15.858
played pool with planets
and given birth to twins,

09:16.020 --> 09:21.014
but I never thought in my entire life
I'd taste an edible Pot Noodle.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.211
Brothers, we bid you welcome.

09:24.940 --> 09:29.377
There must be much
you do not understand. Come.

09:31.740 --> 09:34.049
You're me but you're not me...?

09:34.220 --> 09:39.248
I am part of you, your higher self.
I exist in you as potential.

09:39.420 --> 09:42.139
Now I'm here, extrapolated from your being.

09:42.300 --> 09:45.576
Extrapo-what-alated?
Buddy, no way are you part of me.

09:45.740 --> 09:49.619
No part of me would be seen in sandals.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.561
I find clothes a distraction

09:51.562 --> 09:55.292
from the pursuit of spiritual
and intellectual fulfilment.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.537
That's weird - I find spiritual
and intellectual fulfilment

09:58.740 --> 10:01.652
a distraction from the pursuit of clothes.

10:01.860 --> 10:06.775
Let us join our friends in the meditation
chamber. We can spend the evening

10:06.940 --> 10:10.979
seeking answers to the metaphysical conundra
that have always plagued mankind.

10:11.140 --> 10:14.132
- Sounds wild.
- Hold me back.

10:14.860 --> 10:19.251
Philosophy, poetry, music and study.
That is how we spend our time.

10:19.420 --> 10:23.618
Trying to expand our minds
and unlock our full potential for humankind.

10:24.260 --> 10:26.251
What a pair of losers.

10:26.900 --> 10:31.018
Oh! More visitors. Come, soul-sibling,
let us prepare some refreshments.

10:31.220 --> 10:36.169
May your path lead to wisdom,
and in wisdom know ye peace.

10:42.420 --> 10:45.776
These guys are part of us? I don't buy it.

10:45.980 --> 10:51.657
These are the people we could have become
if all our negative aspects were removed.

10:51.820 --> 10:54.050
Look, you got the gizmo,

10:54.220 --> 10:59.010
let's scram before we're roped into an
evening of philosophy and self-flagellation.

10:59.820 --> 11:04.052
It's not that simple. This triplicator
has only half the vital components.

11:04.220 --> 11:06.939
We need the triplicator from the "low" ship.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.531
Let the entertainment begin.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.229
But first, music and dance.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.754
Brother Rimmer is portraying agony.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.559
The agony of the soul searching out truth.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.433
The truth danced by Brother Cat.

11:30.960 --> 11:35.954
- But truth is elusive.
- It flits like a firefly through the soul,

11:36.120 --> 11:38.031
teasing, confusing.

11:38.240 --> 11:43.109
And agony, in torment,
searches forever in vain.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.836
- Brothers, I am compelled to intrude.
- What is it, sister?

11:49.040 --> 11:53.716
I am receiving a distress call from a ship
which appears to be identical to our own.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.196
Then, we must help them.
With haste, brothers.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.091
Keep 'em peeled, guys.

12:39.820 --> 12:42.937
Welcome, brothers.
We bring food and medical supplies.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.496
Poor devil.
His gun must have gone off accidentally.

12:49.180 --> 12:52.570
Welcome, my children.
We bring you balms and tinctures.

12:54.300 --> 12:58.009
I come in peace to sing you healing hymns.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.568
- Is he dead?
- We can only hope.

13:03.060 --> 13:06.257
Oh! The poor wretch! He has a faulty gun.

13:06.420 --> 13:10.095
He accidentally shot me five times.
Oh, how I love him!

13:10.260 --> 13:15.573
Brother, there is a grievous fault with
thine weapon. It keepeth shooting people.

13:17.260 --> 13:19.330
You see? There it goes again.

13:20.860 --> 13:24.489
- What is this?
- A greeting gift. A sparkling welcome orb.

13:24.700 --> 13:28.659
Come, let us embrace its splendid beauty
and share in its vibrations.

13:28.820 --> 13:31.539
It's exquisite.
What does it say to you, brother?

14:30.480 --> 14:32.471
Rimmer?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.077
Rimmer?

14:39.040 --> 14:41.998
- Rimmer?
- Looking for someone?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.792
Holy smeg!

14:46.960 --> 14:48.996
Hello, my pretty.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.954
What do you want with me?

14:54.120 --> 14:56.634
- I want to hurt you.
- Why?

14:56.840 --> 15:01.516
Because I'm not a very nice person.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.193
A holo-whip.

15:10.920 --> 15:15.755
I'm going to lash you
to within an inch of your life.

15:15.920 --> 15:19.629
And then I'm going to have you.

15:38.920 --> 15:44.711
Sirs, we have less than 20 minutes to
find the second triplicator and set it up.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.030
I suggest we divide our efforts.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.954
- A sage suggestion, brother.
- Perhaps I should go with Brother Cat?

15:51.160 --> 15:55.950
- You haven't got a weapon.
- We have no need. We wear protective herbs.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.150
- I'm going with Bot-Brain.
- As you wish, brother.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.436
Thank you, friend.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.949
- It is ready.
- Put it in his spine.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.429
Wake up. You don't want to miss the pain.

16:23.640 --> 16:28.270
Can you feel the needles
as they burrow into your spine?

16:32.080 --> 16:35.436
You guys are two lettuces short
of an allotment.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.034
- What are you after?
- Your vessel.

16:38.240 --> 16:42.392
- Nothing works here, man.
- Everything is in decay.

16:42.560 --> 16:47.236
And here is how we're going to get it.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.754
- I can't move.
- Of course not.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.956
He hasn't turned you on yet.

16:59.640 --> 17:02.029
Show him.

17:10.960 --> 17:16.193
- He applauds our efforts.
- Maybe he'd like to go for a little walk.

17:16.400 --> 17:20.712
- Game over now, eh?
- I wonder what's in that supply cabinet?

17:39.220 --> 17:41.973
Hmm... Nice movie collection.

17:42.140 --> 17:45.815
"Revenge of the Mutant Splat Gore Monster".

17:45.980 --> 17:48.448
"Die Screaming
with Sharp Things in Your Head".

17:49.260 --> 17:51.455
Gore movies. Weapons magazines.

17:51.620 --> 17:54.578
This is a shrine to all that's low and base,

17:54.740 --> 17:59.097
everything designed to sicken the soul
and shrivel the spirit.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.535
Urgh! Toastie Toppers.

18:03.380 --> 18:04.859
Urgh!

18:05.020 --> 18:07.534
Cinema hot dogs.

18:07.700 --> 18:11.852
Oh! Sweaty kebabs with stringy brown lettuce
coming out. Oh!

18:12.460 --> 18:16.851
Look at this music -
"Hammond Heaven", "Karaoke Krazy",

18:17.020 --> 18:20.217
"Peter Perfect Plays Tuneful Tunes
for Elderly Ladies".

18:20.380 --> 18:23.736
- Let's get outta here.
- Oh, wait. Here it is!

18:23.900 --> 18:27.051
Oh. Clearly,
they have no idea as to its purpose.

18:27.260 --> 18:30.889
- How long do we have?
- Barely eight minutes, sir.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.453
Have I told today how much I love thee?

18:36.620 --> 18:41.569
How much my heart glimmers like a newborn
star when I gaze upon thine countenance?

18:41.740 --> 18:45.494
Thy love refreshes and cleanses me
like a babbling mountain stream.

18:46.860 --> 18:50.409
Mmmmwwwwmm! Mmmnnph!

18:51.180 --> 18:53.330
Your likeness, brother.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.609
Mwww mmffff mmm! Fwwm mmw mmmrrrm!

19:00.820 --> 19:03.288
A knife. Are you hungry, brother?

19:03.460 --> 19:06.930
I have pulses and curd for your refreshment.

19:11.420 --> 19:15.299
Forgive me, brother. I have stained
thy knife-end with my blood.

19:15.860 --> 19:17.851
A thousand apologies.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.652
Brother, let me provide a fresh knife.

19:28.820 --> 19:31.732
Farewell, brother, my brook is babbled.

19:47.100 --> 19:50.092
I found Goalpost-Head.
No sign of Dormouse-Cheeks, though.

19:50.260 --> 19:53.377
- Sir, what happened?
- We were ambushed by Lows.

19:53.540 --> 19:57.738
- I led a valiant rearguard action.
- I found him shivering in a box.

19:58.660 --> 20:03.495
- It was a tactical manoeuvre.
- As was using his uniform as a latrine.

20:04.740 --> 20:06.731
- Where is Mr Lister?
- We got jumped.

20:06.900 --> 20:11.052
He ran off like a gazelle on steroids.
We'll have to leave him.

20:11.260 --> 20:13.979
In four minutes, this
ship will no longer exist.

20:14.420 --> 20:17.617
- Hey, there he is!
- Mmmwww! Hwwwmmm!

20:17.780 --> 20:19.771
What took you so long, buddy?

20:20.460 --> 20:23.293
- What?
- Look out! I'm gonna kill ya!

20:24.340 --> 20:28.413
I'm a homicidal maniac. My body's being
remote-controlled by the Lows.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.857
Kryten, look out!

20:32.020 --> 20:34.215
You gotta stop me!

20:37.540 --> 20:39.132
- Shoot him!
- What?!

20:39.340 --> 20:42.412
- Blow his kneecaps off!
- Give me a break, Rimmer!

20:42.620 --> 20:44.815
He's homicidal. Put him down!

20:45.020 --> 20:48.012
There must be another
way to incapacitate me.

20:48.220 --> 20:51.053
There, Kryten. Hit him with that axe.

20:51.260 --> 20:54.411
- That'll kill me!
- Not if he does it gently.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.418
- He's killing the Cat.
- What can I do?

20:57.620 --> 20:59.975
Incapacitate me in a painless way.

21:03.380 --> 21:05.371
That was unnecessary.

21:05.540 --> 21:09.897
Unnecessary? Look at my neckline.
This stuff never springs back.

21:10.980 --> 21:14.416
Oh, my God!
I think I'm going for the bazookoid!

21:14.620 --> 21:15.939
Duck!

21:16.140 --> 21:17.573
Left!

21:17.780 --> 21:19.259
Right!

21:19.460 --> 21:21.530
I'm trying to reload! Get behind me!

21:21.740 --> 21:25.449
- I'm coming behind you now, sir.
- Take me by surprise.

21:25.620 --> 21:28.612
- I'm taking you by surprise, sir.
- Get on with it!

21:28.780 --> 21:31.214
You may get
an unpleasant sensation of chloroform!

21:31.380 --> 21:34.372
- Surprise me now!
- Here comes my surprise, sir.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.528
OK. How long
before the triplicator activates?

21:43.700 --> 21:45.975
Less than two minutes.

21:52.100 --> 21:54.136
Hurry!

22:03.220 --> 22:06.257
Damn! Flat battery.
Who left the lights on?

22:06.460 --> 22:08.576
No, the magnetic coils have depolarised.

22:08.740 --> 22:11.459
It's as if the decay here is contagious.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.651
- 35 seconds.
- Try the back-up.

22:18.020 --> 22:20.215
Let's get out of here.

22:20.820 --> 22:22.538
All systems check.

22:25.100 --> 22:27.091
We're up. Looking good.

22:30.900 --> 22:33.573
- Not again!
- Watch where you're steering!

22:33.780 --> 22:38.296
- Chloroform him!
- Wait. I've located the spinal implant.

22:41.380 --> 22:44.690
- Where is it? I've lost it.
- It's in his neck.

23:01.900 --> 23:03.697
Holly's back!

23:03.860 --> 23:06.693
Mr Lister, wake up, sir. We're safe now.

23:06.900 --> 23:11.212
Engaging autopilot.
Course zero zero mark zero. Taking her home.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.889
See what you did to my blouson?

23:19.060 --> 23:22.211
- Plus, you almost killed me.
- It wasn't my fault.

23:22.380 --> 23:26.578
- Once you get one of them things in you...
- Sir, what's wrong?

23:26.780 --> 23:30.932
- I think he just sat on the implant.
- But who's controlling him?

23:36.540 --> 23:39.373
I'll remove the implant and destroy it.

23:42.220 --> 23:45.053
Uh-uh. Wait. One week, that's all I ask.

23:45.220 --> 23:47.290
What are you talking about?

23:50.460 --> 23:52.610
Boy, this is gonna be fun.

23:53.305 --> 23:59.922
