01:49.568 --> 01:50.985
Al:
You might, Dan,

01:51.153 --> 01:53.780
want to learn how to indicate
interest in a girl

01:53.947 --> 01:56.991
other than murdering
another person.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.827
I apologize for the disruption

01:59.995 --> 02:03.706
and the free drinks you had
to give out restoring order.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.876
Jesus Christ,
it's false dawn, Al.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.544
False dawn already.

02:08.711 --> 02:12.298
If we're gonna act,
we should do it in darkness.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.966
Where's the fucking whore?

02:14.134 --> 02:16.677
Wherever Trixie is,
we know what we need to.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.180
Bullock's four square
behind the New York woman.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.182
The question's do we act?

02:21.350 --> 02:23.684
And to me, the course is clear.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.228
Well, what's the course?

02:25.395 --> 02:27.313
Murder them where they sleep!

02:27.481 --> 02:30.316
The New York woman
and Bullock both.

02:30.484 --> 02:34.403
Dan, loan EB your knife.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.988
I won't brandish the knife,

02:36.156 --> 02:39.033
but I'll wield a passkey
at the widow's door.

02:39.201 --> 02:42.036
As for Bullock, he sleeps
on his store's second floor,

02:42.204 --> 02:44.372
and I'll steady a ladder,
Dan, at that wall,

02:44.540 --> 02:46.415
while you climb up
and bushwhack him.

02:47.709 --> 02:51.045
Then, with them dead
and disposed of,

02:51.213 --> 02:54.549
we forge a predated bill of sale,
take possession of the claim

02:54.716 --> 02:57.218
with the allocated
percentages of ownership

02:57.386 --> 02:59.929
previously agreed to
in our internal discussions,

03:00.097 --> 03:03.474
and don't spend a fucking
dollar in the process.

03:08.564 --> 03:09.897
Bold?

03:10.941 --> 03:12.275
I suppose.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.402
But when boldness is called for,

03:14.570 --> 03:16.153
bold men do not shrink.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.114
That's what the B
in EB Farnum stands for.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.574
Bold.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.576
(slams desk)
You're goddamn right.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.077
Say it, Al.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.913
Say the fucking words
my bones already know.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.457
You're gonna back off
on that fucking claim.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.877
(gunshots)

03:31.044 --> 03:33.004
(cheering)

03:36.425 --> 03:40.177
We brung it, sir. Vaccine for the smallpox,
secured in Cheyenne.

03:40.345 --> 03:44.223
Well done, fellas, and congratulations
from the entire fucking settlement.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.226
EB, get downstairs and give
these heroes what they're owed.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.062
- Yes, sir. $50 a man.
- If you don't spend it in my joint,

03:50.230 --> 03:52.356
I'll turn the mourning
over to weeping.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.151
You won't shed nary a tear
on our account, Mr. Swearengen.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.361
Vaccine to Doc Cochran
in the pest tent.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.865
We'll be toasting the treaty too
with the fucking heathens.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.117
- Explain yourself.
- Man: They've all been

04:03.285 --> 04:05.661
called back to the agency.
We heard that in Cheyenne.

04:05.829 --> 04:09.165
- Are they going's the fucking question.
- Fuck yeah, they are.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.125
Man #2:
That's the word in Cheyenne.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.920
Red Cloud and Spotted Tail
are leading their people in.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.632
Dan, $10 in bonus credits
across the board for these heroes.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.593
10 in pussy, 10 in faro, 10 in booze.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.429
- (men cheer)
- God bless you, Mr. Swearengen!

04:23.597 --> 04:25.306
Well, not likely,

04:25.474 --> 04:27.808
but my short-term prospects
just improved.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.062
Say the words,
so I can let the dream die.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.189
EB, did you not hear
the fucking news?

04:33.357 --> 04:35.316
Did you not listen
to the fucking news?

04:35.484 --> 04:37.610
The plague's end's in prospect.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.947
And so's peace with the fucking
dirt worshippers.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.367
Come here, come here.

04:45.369 --> 04:46.744
Sit down.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.789
The dam...

04:49.957 --> 04:51.666
has broken, young man,

04:51.833 --> 04:54.919
and only ourselves can fuck up,

04:55.087 --> 04:57.296
for we are about to be
swimming in money.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.507
And how could we fuck up?

04:59.675 --> 05:02.385
By engaging in open
fucking bloodletting.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.179
When right here at hand
in our very hour of need

05:05.347 --> 05:07.682
is the priggish fucking
douchebag Bullock,

05:07.849 --> 05:09.809
who only wants
to sell pots and pans,

05:09.977 --> 05:12.103
fan his pretty face and hold his nose

05:12.270 --> 05:14.814
from the stench of our sordid
carryings on over here,

05:14.982 --> 05:18.025
all the time thinking he can protect
the meek and innocent.

05:18.193 --> 05:21.028
The perfect fucking front man.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.197
And you want to kill him?

05:23.365 --> 05:25.783
Much as we might
want the widow's claim,

05:25.951 --> 05:28.577
it's a luxury now to forego.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.123
EB, find yourself
somewhere to lie down

05:32.290 --> 05:34.375
till the feeling passes, huh?

05:35.794 --> 05:38.504
First I'll go give
the hoople-heads their money.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.047
Thank you.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.640
You go find that fucking whore.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.102
What the fuck is this, huh?

05:54.813 --> 05:56.439
(hoarsely)
I lost my voice.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.400
(knocks)

06:01.028 --> 06:04.905
- What happened?
- I seen something bad.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.824
Come in.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.124
Here, sit down.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.878
I seen something
at the place my brother works.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.048
A man was stabbed and killed
right in front of me.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.092
One man said he didn't
like the way the other man

06:25.260 --> 06:27.636
was looking at me
and he stabbed and killed him.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.441
Drink this.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.946
Where's your brother now?

06:46.114 --> 06:48.115
We got a room.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.243
I'll go in a minute.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.412
It's all right, Flora.

06:55.290 --> 06:58.667
I just come to say
I don't know if I can do this.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.669
It's horrible.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.588
It's one thing leads to another

07:02.756 --> 07:05.132
and you never know
when it's gonna happen.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.343
Mostly you can steer it, sweetheart,

07:07.511 --> 07:09.929
and when it's gonna
get to where you can't,

07:10.097 --> 07:12.848
you get just a little notice,
just a couple of seconds

07:13.016 --> 07:15.392
before the one thing
turns into the other.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.979
It's like a funny smell
comes into the air,

07:19.147 --> 07:21.690
then you know there's
no more steering

07:21.858 --> 07:23.859
and get the hell out of the way.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.321
I smelled it in the saloon.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.532
And did you get out
of the way in time?

07:33.161 --> 07:35.121
It's all right. It's all right.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.584
Miles doesn't know nothing.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.711
He didn't smell nothing and he

07:42.879 --> 07:44.880
didn't know nothing
about what to do.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.800
All right, I know.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.554
Can I stay?

07:51.721 --> 07:55.724
Can I sleep here with you just this last
little while before we have to get up?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.435
Yeah, you can sleep
here with me.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.045
Can you help?

09:19.100 --> 09:21.977
- Name?
- Mullins.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.520
Make your mark.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.564
Saint Andy Cramed.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.110
All that's missing are
the scourges and flays.

09:31.613 --> 09:35.407
- Maybe they're under his shirt.
- (laughs)

09:48.380 --> 09:51.048
Kind of you to let us work
out of the horseshit and flies.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.716
Sure.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.974
(groans)

10:00.141 --> 10:02.142
Jesus Christ!

10:12.112 --> 10:14.321
(rasping)
Have you seen Trixie, Doc?

10:14.489 --> 10:16.532
What?

10:18.994 --> 10:20.494
Trixie.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.957
No. Tea and honey.

10:26.793 --> 10:30.254
- For this?
- You are a stupid son of a bitch.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.173
Yeah, the traffic's a boon, Seth.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.885
We're up $27 already
from yesterday's entire proceeds.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.595
Good.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.724
Pitiful specimen you are.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.728
It wasn't the pinprick. I ain't ate.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.939
Really?
Strange you never keeled over

10:49.107 --> 10:51.108
when we was hungry
on the fucking trail.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.989
Your boss speak to you about
sending me an assayer this morning?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.408
No, sir, he didn't.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.578
I will remind him

11:02.746 --> 11:04.747
once I finish this errand I'm on.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.082
I only got one place left to look:

11:07.250 --> 11:09.501
Bella Union--
that's our competition.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.213
Well, I'll tell him what you said.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.844
Good morning.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.096
Good morning, Mr. Bullock.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.557
Come to have
the child inoculated?

11:23.725 --> 11:25.392
Yes, and to tell you,

11:25.560 --> 11:28.520
for reasons we needn't explore,
that my plans have changed.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.231
As soon as I can
arrange transportation

11:31.399 --> 11:33.901
I'll return with the child
to New York City.

11:34.069 --> 11:37.154
Why needn't we
explore your reasons?

11:37.322 --> 11:39.656
Because, Mr. Bullock, I've already

11:39.824 --> 11:41.825
quite sufficiently imposed upon you

11:41.993 --> 11:43.827
my private reasons and facts.

11:46.373 --> 11:50.209
As regards to the claim my husband
purchased before his murder,

11:50.377 --> 11:53.837
I'm inclined to accept the last bid
from Mr. Swearengen's hand-puppet

11:54.005 --> 11:57.216
and I would be very grateful
if you would tell Mr. Farnum so,

11:57.384 --> 11:59.927
as speaking to him directly makes me ill.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.305
I'm gonna assay your claim,
Mrs. Garret.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.016
I promised Mr. Hickok
and I promised you.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.644
I released you from your promise
to me yesterday.

12:08.812 --> 12:12.648
- And today I instruct you not to keep it.
- You do tend to change your mind,

12:12.816 --> 12:16.193
and the first promise,
you weren't a party to.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.115
Why don't you get the child inoculated?
I'll go about my business,

12:21.282 --> 12:24.451
and we'll revisit
the whole mess subsequently.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.292
Don't fucking lead Ellsworth right to it

12:32.460 --> 12:34.837
so he can hoop and holler
and hail fucking Bullock.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.089
You walk around.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.800
You're discouraged.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.804
It's not even worth it
to make the steep ascent.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.514
I start from below?

12:46.808 --> 12:50.144
You start at the fucking creek.
What, do you want to start at the cliff?

12:50.311 --> 12:52.896
The three of you leap
the fuck off holding hands?

12:55.316 --> 12:56.859
Top o' the mornin'.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.739
I'm to lead you
to the widow Garret's claim.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.576
- You're the assayer?
- Nope.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.455
- I'm to take you to him.
- He's one claim over.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.206
Nice fucking guy

13:11.374 --> 13:13.500
and a dead eye
for the fucking color.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.377
- Ellsworth.
- Ellsworth...

13:15.545 --> 13:17.671
is absolutely right.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.465
Dan: Well, come on.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.643
I was inoculated some time ago,

13:31.811 --> 13:34.688
but I thought she should
be treated before our trip.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.858
I am delighted
you're taking her with you.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.651
It was Trixie who made me realize

13:39.819 --> 13:42.029
that my reasons
for staying weren't sound.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.448
Glad she succeeded where I failed.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.117
I intend to write her
a note of profound thanks.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.412
I hope that you'll deliver it to her
at Mr. Swearengen's saloon.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.248
Is that where she went
when she left you?

13:53.416 --> 13:56.126
Yes. I certainly assume so.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.927
Sorry, I'm sorry, honey.
It's all over.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.597
When will you be leavin'?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.807
As quickly as is practical.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.352
Mr. Utter can see
to your travel arrangements.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.271
Soon as he gets his wits back,
I'll send him to you.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.273
Thank you, Doctor.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.151
Thank you for everything.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.251
What did she say about Trixie?

14:37.418 --> 14:39.253
Nothin'.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.758
How'd you do with that bloodstain?

14:44.926 --> 14:47.636
I scrubbed it real hard.

14:47.804 --> 14:51.557
Did I ask you how hard
you fucking scrubbed?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.058
- No.
- No.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.645
I asked if you got it out.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.694
Get me the fuckin' scrub brush.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.863
Every fucking thing
I gotta do myself, huh?

15:07.031 --> 15:09.616
- Where is she?!
- Trixie?

15:09.784 --> 15:12.244
No, Queen fucking Victoria.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.664
Last I saw her was yesterday
when she came to see you.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.791
Just get me the fucking scrub brush.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.127
Gives her word she'll return,

15:20.295 --> 15:21.670
where the fuck is she, huh?

15:25.049 --> 15:26.925
What'd she say to you
when you saw her?

15:27.093 --> 15:29.386
She said her pussy hurt
where you grabbed it.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.638
That has a ring of fucking truth.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.807
She said you nearly killed her.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.059
She said to me she'd be right back.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.146
A fool's fucking errand, anyway.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.065
I found out what I needed to know
when I looked

15:42.233 --> 15:45.569
in that cocksucker Bullock's eyes
while Dority was spilling blood

15:45.737 --> 15:48.989
that you have failed
to adequately clean up.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.907
You want me to do some more?

15:51.075 --> 15:52.951
No, shut the fuck up.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.496
Now what's she doin'?

15:56.664 --> 15:58.415
Is she making a point?

15:58.583 --> 16:00.792
No grabbing at the cunt?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.753
- Is that what she said to you?
- No.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.422
I mean, y-you-- she told you,
right, that I grabbed her?

16:05.590 --> 16:07.090
Did she have an attitude about it?

16:07.258 --> 16:09.968
She didn't have an attitude.
She just said her pussy hurt.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.887
Agh.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.056
Point's made
with the snatch grabs, okay.

16:15.767 --> 16:19.186
50 other fucking things
I should be paying attention to,

16:19.354 --> 16:21.605
rosiest prospects of my career,

16:21.773 --> 16:24.941
and here I am on
my fucking hands and knees

16:25.109 --> 16:27.444
discussing snippets
of information with a gimp.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.862
There!

16:29.030 --> 16:32.366
Now that's how you scrub
a fucking bloodstain!

16:33.493 --> 16:35.160
I couldn't find Trixie.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.539
You see her, you send her
the fuck back to me,

16:39.707 --> 16:43.001
'cause if I see her outside, she'll wish
I had fucking killed her before.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.671
That shot didn't hurt too bad, Al,

16:45.838 --> 16:47.422
but it fucking itches.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.508
Yeah? Good.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.135
You had your shot yet, kid?

16:52.303 --> 16:53.720
Not yet. The line was too long

16:53.888 --> 16:55.722
and I did not want
to be late for work.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.642
Open for business.
And talk like him

16:58.810 --> 17:01.770
- until further instructed.
- (rasps) Yes, sir.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.576
Aw, Jesus.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.329
Trixie?

17:26.170 --> 17:28.588
God damn it, Trixie, wake up.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.924
- Wake up, Trixie.
- (knock on door)

17:31.092 --> 17:33.593
- Trixie, wake up--
- AW: Doc! Doc!

17:34.929 --> 17:36.221
- What?!
- Doc!

17:36.389 --> 17:38.390
- Stay the fuck over there!
- It's AW, Doc.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.935
Stay the fuck over there, anyway.

17:42.103 --> 17:45.272
Uh, I don't take your
bad temper personally, Doc.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.691
The hours you're working
would try a saint.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.276
What do you want?

17:49.444 --> 17:52.571
(panting) I'm in pain, Doc,
in the small of my back,

17:52.739 --> 17:55.949
which I'm aware is
a precursor symptom.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.951
- When did the pain start?
- Am I warm?

17:58.119 --> 17:59.953
Answer the question.

18:00.121 --> 18:03.915
Well, it's become more
concentrated and severe.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.503
- Why did you strike me?
- To secure your attention.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.630
When did the pain start?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.633
The original pain I've lived with
for quite some time,

18:13.801 --> 18:15.093
but in this last period,

18:15.261 --> 18:18.805
it's become much more
concentrated and severe.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.767
In viewing the context of this outbreak,

18:21.934 --> 18:23.894
I knew I should consult you.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.812
- Ow.
- You don't have a fever.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.272
- I don't?
- No.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.024
You put on weight?

18:30.568 --> 18:32.652
May I ask that query's relevance?

18:32.820 --> 18:36.198
It's harder on your back
as you get fatter.

18:38.576 --> 18:41.077
So in concert with the symptoms

18:41.245 --> 18:43.038
I'm already exhibiting,

18:43.206 --> 18:46.416
you'd say be alert for fever?

18:46.584 --> 18:48.668
And work hard on your paper.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.962
- And get yourself inoculated.
- Uh-huh.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.923
And try to eat less.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.812
You botched this job pretty good,

19:06.979 --> 19:08.688
didn't you, young lady?

19:16.197 --> 19:19.950
Now you listen to me--
if you want,

19:20.117 --> 19:23.703
I will do the job for you right.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.039
But first, I want you to know that

19:26.207 --> 19:27.999
that rich woman is leaving town

19:28.167 --> 19:31.211
and she told me that
she would take you with her.

19:31.379 --> 19:34.214
I know that you
thought enough of that woman

19:34.382 --> 19:36.591
to help her get off this... stuff

19:36.759 --> 19:39.469
you tried to use to kill yourself with.

19:39.637 --> 19:43.056
But what I don't know is
if you wanted to die period,

19:43.224 --> 19:45.725
or 'cause you thought you didn't
have a way out of here?

19:45.893 --> 19:49.563
'Cause you do have a way out.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.903
Is that a vote for New York City?

19:59.740 --> 20:01.491
All right, then.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.047
(door opens)

21:04.764 --> 21:06.306
Morning, Mr. Tolliver.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.142
Good morning, Flora.

21:10.645 --> 21:13.271
I swear I saw you leave
last night after your shift.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.731
I come back.

21:14.899 --> 21:18.026
A man was murdered where
my brother works, at The Gem saloon,

21:18.194 --> 21:20.612
- and I got scared.
- You saw it, honey?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.657
Yes, sir. I was there
picking my brother up.

21:23.824 --> 21:26.868
You're brave to even be
in a joint like that.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.041
And after,

21:33.209 --> 21:35.293
you sought refuge
with Joanie, did you?

21:35.461 --> 21:38.755
- Yes, sir.
- No better port in a storm.

21:39.882 --> 21:43.176
- Anyways, I'll go change.
- Good girl. Good for you.

21:45.012 --> 21:48.515
- You've settle in real good, Flora.
- Thank you, sir.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.730
Mm-hmm, Joanie Stubbs.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.441
Is that a fresh scalp
I see hanging from your belt?

21:58.609 --> 22:00.026
She saw a gutting last night.

22:00.194 --> 22:03.113
She was upset. I held her.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.116
Terrance: I was watching
for you at the door, Flora,

22:06.283 --> 22:08.743
but here you are already inside.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.370
Not working yet, Terrance.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.288
Poor thing.

22:12.456 --> 22:15.417
Adjusting so smooth
to losing her cherry

22:15.584 --> 22:18.211
and yet that upset by blood.

22:18.379 --> 22:21.131
She lost her cherry back home.
I told you that.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.049
Gonna put your garters on now?

22:39.233 --> 22:41.901
I'll give you $2 for that apple
and a piece of cheese.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.157
It's my knife.
You want to buy that?

22:47.324 --> 22:48.950
I've got a fucking knife.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.545
I'll just be a second--
take my brother his lunch.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.213
Sure, honey.

23:08.554 --> 23:11.222
Unless she ain't upset at all.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.903
What happened now, Flora?

23:25.071 --> 23:28.490
I thought you was changin'
into your garters.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.366
You geek-looking fuck.

23:30.534 --> 23:33.536
Get away from me before
I cut your fucking heart out.

23:47.301 --> 23:49.969
(knocks)
It's Dr. Cochran.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.728
Doctor.

23:58.896 --> 24:01.606
Trixie tried to commit suicide
with laudanum.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.859
- My God.
- She punctured her vein.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.946
That's the only reason
why she's still alive.

24:17.832 --> 24:20.125
Who's with her?

24:20.292 --> 24:23.586
No one at the goddamn moment
is with her, Mrs. Garret.

24:23.754 --> 24:27.799
Her situation in this camp isn't such
that that would be safe.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.677
Which is why,
while trying to dissuade her

24:30.845 --> 24:33.304
from future efforts at murdering herself,

24:33.472 --> 24:36.558
I told a fib,

24:36.725 --> 24:39.477
invoking your name
and willingness

24:39.645 --> 24:41.896
to take her with you on your trip.

24:43.649 --> 24:46.442
Last night, Doctor,
I made that very offer to Trixie.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.528
She refused.

24:51.282 --> 24:53.408
More precisely,

24:53.576 --> 24:56.786
I offered to send Trixie
to New York

24:56.954 --> 24:59.497
with the child,
to make the appropriate

24:59.665 --> 25:01.207
introductions to my family

25:01.375 --> 25:03.835
and to pay to see them established.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.045
Is it possible, Mrs. Garret,

25:06.213 --> 25:10.049
that leaving this camp
and heading to New York City

25:10.217 --> 25:13.344
in service to you
and the child might,

25:13.512 --> 25:18.016
to a girl like Trixie,
appear a more realistic proposition

25:18.184 --> 25:22.604
than being dispatched
on some cruel masquerade?

25:27.276 --> 25:30.361
Please tell her she's welcome.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.406
Tell her she's necessary.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.910
If her indisposition
doesn't preclude it,

25:37.077 --> 25:39.204
I'd be happy to tell her myself.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.497
Thank you, madam.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.330
Ellsworth:
If I'm to get my throat cut, Dan,

26:22.498 --> 26:25.667
I'd rather not exert myself further.

26:27.044 --> 26:30.463
If I have any choice in the matter,
I'd prefer one behind the ear.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.966
Keep climbing, Ellsworth.

26:33.133 --> 26:36.302
You're off the hook for seeing
that New York dude's accident.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.308
If Swearengen was
moved to trust,

26:42.476 --> 26:44.477
I know you spoke for me hard.

26:44.645 --> 26:46.896
Well, I didn't.
Didn't speak against you.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.693
You might try takin'
a gander over to your right.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.654
You don't have to tell me
where to fucking look.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.490
If you're the goddamn assayer,

26:57.658 --> 26:59.909
shouldn't I be following you?

27:02.288 --> 27:04.247
Head on back down, Mr. Bullock.

27:04.415 --> 27:07.333
We think we found
a formation worth looking at.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.219
Young lady, thank Christ.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.346
I'd feared after the murder
you'd shun us.

27:20.514 --> 27:22.390
I come for lunch with Miles.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.726
Bless you then
for being a caring sister.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.936
- Miles!
- Sir?

27:27.104 --> 27:30.189
Miles, you lucky son of a bitch,
your sister's here with your lunch.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.858
She brought you a fresh apple

27:32.026 --> 27:34.360
and some kind of delicacy
wrapped in swaddling.

27:36.739 --> 27:40.325
I've been scrubbing that bloodstain
all mornin', and the cripple has too.

27:40.492 --> 27:44.162
Situate your sister to spare her
staring at that fucking stain, huh?

27:52.046 --> 27:54.005
- Let's do it.
- Now?

27:54.173 --> 27:56.632
- Now, and get the fuck outta here.
- What if--

27:56.800 --> 27:59.385
Flora, if we do it slow and right,
we're 50 miles gone

27:59.553 --> 28:02.013
- before anyone knows we blew.
- My boss is onto me.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.974
Savvy operator from Chicago
and you can tell he's on to you?

28:05.142 --> 28:08.519
Savvy enough that he didn't crack
and I still could fucking tell.

28:12.983 --> 28:15.777
You're full of shit.
You want to do it fast and dirty

28:15.944 --> 28:18.321
so you have to cut somebody's throat.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.916
- This joint you want to take?
- Where I work.

28:30.084 --> 28:33.252
- Where your boss is onto you?
- I can move the dyke.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.925
Held me in her arms all night
like I was a little fucking kid.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.640
Can I assume
there's a fucking plan?

28:55.567 --> 28:57.151
Mr. Bullock, what ho?

28:57.319 --> 28:58.694
Mrs. Garret's room.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.738
Number two.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.294
Don't sell, Mrs. Garret.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.984
Darling...

29:38.152 --> 29:41.362
um, I'm going to be unspeakably rude

29:41.530 --> 29:43.614
and leave you here alone
for just a moment

29:43.782 --> 29:45.616
while I go downstairs
with Mr. Bullock,

29:45.784 --> 29:48.286
who's just arrived
with the most interesting news,

29:48.454 --> 29:50.621
and whom I-- I can't
receive here in my room,

29:50.789 --> 29:52.665
particularly with you present--

29:52.833 --> 29:55.293
for reasons too boring
and complex to explain.

29:55.461 --> 29:59.964
So I'm going to go downstairs
to speak with Mr. Bullock

30:00.132 --> 30:01.966
in Mr. Farnum's absurd restaurant,

30:02.134 --> 30:03.593
then I'll come back up

30:03.760 --> 30:06.762
and we will continue to ready
our leaving. All right, darling?

30:08.348 --> 30:12.185
I'll be in the restaurant
for just one moment.

30:13.187 --> 30:14.729
Can I bring you a glass of milk?

30:16.732 --> 30:18.024
All right.

30:18.192 --> 30:20.359
I'll-- I'll be right back.

30:31.538 --> 30:34.081
May I inquire
as to the assay's outcome?

30:34.249 --> 30:36.792
- Ask the owner.
- Mrs. Garret?

30:36.960 --> 30:39.545
Is the technical term "bonanza"?

30:39.713 --> 30:41.130
That's the look of it.

30:41.298 --> 30:42.965
It's a bonanza, Mr. Farnum.

30:45.719 --> 30:49.180
I see. Congratulations.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.143
(whimpers)

30:54.311 --> 30:57.480
Does the find change your mind
at all about New York City?

31:00.609 --> 31:02.902
I can't see why it would.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.613
I can't either, but I don't count.

31:05.781 --> 31:08.366
Of course you count.
Why wouldn't you?

31:08.534 --> 31:12.745
'Cause your changes of mind
come so quick and often I can't keep up.

31:12.913 --> 31:16.207
I can't understand what changed
your mind from yesterday

31:16.375 --> 31:18.209
when it was made up to stay.

31:19.503 --> 31:22.046
I was made to understand last night
that my reasons

31:22.214 --> 31:24.966
for wanting to stay have been
completely selfish.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.343
- By who?
- Trixie.

31:27.511 --> 31:31.180
I'd offered to send her
to New York City with the child,

31:31.348 --> 31:33.474
where Trixie,
I've since come to realize,

31:33.642 --> 31:36.102
would be completely unsuited

31:36.270 --> 31:40.481
and because I wished
to stay here unencumbered

31:40.649 --> 31:44.860
when I should be caring for the child.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.029
Why can't you care for her here?

31:49.908 --> 31:51.784
Where the fuck is he?

31:51.952 --> 31:54.870
Said he was gonna go tell
the widow of her find.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.206
How the fuck long
does it take to tell her?

31:57.374 --> 31:59.417
I don't know, Al.
I'm here with you.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.044
- Are you getting smart with me now?
- No.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.797
Cocksucker Bullock.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.799
When you can't stand the sight of him,

32:06.967 --> 32:09.135
he's nowhere but underfoot.

32:09.303 --> 32:11.596
Sir, my sister was told of a man

32:11.763 --> 32:14.348
who resembles our father's
photograph down by Lead,

32:14.516 --> 32:16.309
and I'd be grateful if this afternoon

32:16.476 --> 32:19.270
I could go look and maybe I could
take a night shift to make up.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.813
If I said no,

32:20.981 --> 32:24.233
I'd hope you'd walk out
and go looking anyway,

32:24.401 --> 32:27.194
then seek a new job elsewhere after.

32:27.362 --> 32:28.613
That is what I'd do, sir.

32:28.780 --> 32:32.241
All right, kid. Go look for him.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.327
Tell Arnette at the livery stable

32:34.494 --> 32:36.537
I'll stand metal for the horse.

32:36.705 --> 32:40.041
If your sister looks with you,
tell Arnette I'm good for her mount.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.252
So you think it's
a good idea to go?

32:43.420 --> 32:45.379
It's why the fuck
you're here, isn't it?

32:45.547 --> 32:47.256
Right.

32:47.424 --> 32:50.134
I'm gonna go get the horses then.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.095
Permission to leave
the bar, trooper.

32:57.059 --> 32:59.101
Thanks to both of you.

33:03.357 --> 33:06.108
Ah, struck rich
for the widow, huh, Bullock?

33:06.276 --> 33:07.735
Free drink!

33:13.200 --> 33:15.534
Big, huh?

33:16.536 --> 33:18.996
Rich and fucking thick,
that vein is?

33:19.164 --> 33:21.248
Not being expert,
I can't guess at the extent.

33:21.416 --> 33:25.002
Dan's a fucking expert. When he's not
shit-faced drunk, so is Ellsworth.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.380
The immediate result
is she won't be sellin'.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.382
Of course, she fucking won't.

33:29.549 --> 33:31.717
I should fucking think not, huh?

33:31.885 --> 33:34.178
Not for any $20,000 at least.

33:36.056 --> 33:39.433
Come here, Bullock.
Come drink with your vanquished foe.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.897
Al: Very good of you
and Mr. Star, incidentally,

33:45.065 --> 33:48.317
to make your venue available
so the hoople-heads could get vaccinated.

33:48.485 --> 33:50.945
I was the second hoople-head stuck.

33:51.113 --> 33:53.322
Them riders that
brought the vaccine

33:53.490 --> 33:55.908
say the heathens have been
called back to the agency.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.369
In a spasm of good sense,
they're fucking going.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.870
I heard.

34:01.164 --> 34:04.500
Before you know it, we'll have
laws here and every other fucking thing.

34:04.668 --> 34:07.545
Yeah, which brings me, Bullock,
to the matter of the widow.

34:07.713 --> 34:11.924
I wanted to show you
my bona fides for cooperation.

34:12.092 --> 34:15.761
If a treaty is signed,
be wise for you and me

34:15.929 --> 34:17.471
to paddle in the same direction.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.933
Tics or habits of behavior
either finds dislikable in the other

34:21.101 --> 34:23.436
gotta be overlooked
or taken with a grain of salt.

34:23.603 --> 34:27.188
Would your bona fides extend
to Mrs. Garret's future safety?

34:30.610 --> 34:32.319
My oath on this:

34:32.487 --> 34:35.947
every day that the widow sits
on her ass in New York City,

34:36.116 --> 34:38.284
looks west at sunset
and thinks to herself,

34:38.452 --> 34:41.036
"God bless you ignorant
cocksuckers in Deadwood,

34:41.204 --> 34:43.289
who strive mightily and at little money

34:43.456 --> 34:45.666
to add to my ever-increasing fortune,"

34:45.833 --> 34:48.168
she'll be safe from the wiles
of Al Swearengen.

34:48.335 --> 34:49.837
She's stayin'.

34:53.967 --> 34:56.427
The oath stands
as a gesture to you.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.431
- Can I take a shave over here?
- Please.

35:04.478 --> 35:09.106
Barney, be careful in the area
of the throat, huh?

35:11.902 --> 35:15.154
If you authorized an offer
of 20 on the widow's claim...

35:16.156 --> 35:18.449
your agent was looking
to skim a little cream.

35:18.617 --> 35:22.203
- How high did EB go?
- $19,500.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.166
I wouldn't trust a man
that wouldn't try to steal a little.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.889
Where's that fucking whore?

35:54.986 --> 35:57.530
You stay here, sweetheart.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.927
I'm so very sorry...

36:20.095 --> 36:22.721
for any part that
I may have played in this.

36:25.684 --> 36:29.270
I don't remember you being the one
that made me a whore, Mrs. Garret.

36:32.899 --> 36:36.151
I'm going to stay in the camp
with the child, Trixie.

36:37.571 --> 36:40.072
Dr. Cochran explained
to me the difficulties

36:40.240 --> 36:42.324
your extraordinary kindness toward me

36:42.492 --> 36:45.077
has put you in in relationship
to Mr. Swearengen.

36:45.245 --> 36:46.787
If you wish to stay,

36:46.955 --> 36:50.541
I'd be so grateful
if you'd stay with us.

36:54.754 --> 36:57.339
But perhaps you want to go, Trixie.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.717
If you do...

37:01.303 --> 37:03.137
take this...

37:05.473 --> 37:08.475
as your earnest claim on the future.

37:10.020 --> 37:11.979
I'll send you more.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.274
I appear to have struck it rich.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.860
I'll send you all that you need.

37:18.028 --> 37:19.945
Girl: Trixie?

37:26.411 --> 37:27.870
Trixie?

37:28.038 --> 37:30.497
Hello, sweetheart.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.083
(whispers)
Don't I look tired?

37:33.251 --> 37:35.377
Sofia.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.716
Sofia.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.762
Sofia.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.724
You're so beautiful.

37:49.893 --> 37:52.186
I should've guessed it.

37:55.857 --> 37:57.942
Take her home, Mrs. Garret.

38:05.575 --> 38:07.576
How do you take my suggestion?

38:09.079 --> 38:10.913
Are you sure that gold's real?

38:11.081 --> 38:13.207
Absolutely.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.543
Uh, let me think things through.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.506
All right.

38:28.682 --> 38:30.724
(door opens, closes)

38:39.025 --> 38:42.194
- What's your name?
- Elizabeth.

38:44.948 --> 38:48.325
- I'm quittin'.
- All right, Flora.

38:48.493 --> 38:51.662
I left a pin up in your room.
I wanna go look for it.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.208
Go ahead and look.

39:00.922 --> 39:04.091
When does the part come when that little
piece of trim finally gets into

39:04.259 --> 39:07.052
her working clothes and starts
making us some fucking money?

39:07.220 --> 39:09.346
She's quitting, Cy.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.182
She's quitting?

39:12.350 --> 39:16.020
And that seems to be your room
she's walking into yet again.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.272
She lost a pin up there.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.442
A pin?

39:47.510 --> 39:49.970
Can you tell the stones
from the paste?

39:51.347 --> 39:53.557
Show me which is which.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.102
I don't think so.

39:57.270 --> 39:59.605
- Let me take it.
- Get outta here, Flora.

39:59.773 --> 40:03.192
Put down my things and I'll let you
get out without raising hell.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.945
Why don't let me go with your things
and shut your fucking mouth?

40:07.113 --> 40:10.866
Because I remind you of whoever
the fuck I remind you of.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.745
No.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.164
Now what are you gonna do,
Flora, kill me?

40:19.459 --> 40:20.918
Maybe.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.753
You think you're gonna
get out of here alive?

40:22.921 --> 40:26.381
- I'll give it a goddamn whirl.
- You're not gonna get out alive.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.010
You're gonna die here.

40:30.178 --> 40:32.596
Who am I?

40:35.141 --> 40:37.226
Your little baby?

40:37.393 --> 40:38.769
Your little sister?

40:40.563 --> 40:42.106
You?

40:57.789 --> 40:59.623
I wouldn't move this.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.761
- Did you find your pin?
- I did, sir.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.596
Joanie tells me you're leaving us.

41:14.764 --> 41:16.932
Can't take it anymore, sir.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.851
Decided I wasn't cut out for it.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.435
My brother too.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.521
Decided he wasn't cut out for what?

41:22.689 --> 41:24.398
Sweeping up
at The Gem saloon.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.860
(chuckling)
I see.

41:28.027 --> 41:31.029
My first take on your meaning was
they were fucking your brother

41:31.197 --> 41:33.824
for money over there
like you was gettin' done to here.

41:35.368 --> 41:38.954
- Step aside and let me do my business.
- (door closes)

41:40.123 --> 41:42.207
And what is your fucking business?!

41:42.375 --> 41:44.251
You with your beady little ferret eyes.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.628
She came to say goodbye, Cy.
She's moving on.

41:46.796 --> 41:49.631
- It don't feel right to me, babe.
- (grunts)

41:51.885 --> 41:53.886
But if I'm mistaken in my judgment,

41:54.053 --> 41:56.513
may I regret what I just did
for the rest of my life.

41:56.681 --> 41:59.099
- Now let her go!
- (grunts)

41:59.267 --> 42:02.060
- (Flora screaming)
- You little cunt!

42:03.479 --> 42:05.230
You're gonna die here!

42:05.398 --> 42:06.899
(continues screaming)

42:07.066 --> 42:08.692
Come on!

42:11.196 --> 42:14.990
Get outta here. Get her out front.
Get around! They're goin' over the top!

42:18.411 --> 42:19.661
Come on.

42:19.829 --> 42:22.039
Don't impede her progress, Joanie.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.083
Don't do nothing rash.

42:48.816 --> 42:51.610
- What are you doing?
- What's none of your business!

42:51.778 --> 42:54.863
Them two robbed my joint.
That's where they're gonna be dealt with.

42:55.031 --> 42:58.533
I guess they needn't
get beat anymore out here.

42:59.994 --> 43:01.995
Take 'em the fuck inside, boys.

43:07.252 --> 43:11.088
And you can help your delicate
sensibilities by turning the fuck away.

43:36.489 --> 43:39.283
Cy wants you up there, honey.

43:55.133 --> 43:58.677
Cy: I tell you, sweetheart, your face
come out of that in pretty good shape.

43:58.845 --> 44:01.513
Matters took a happy turn,
you could still probably work.

44:01.681 --> 44:02.931
(door opens)

44:03.099 --> 44:05.100
Come on in, honey,

44:05.268 --> 44:08.645
over here on what the dagos
call my sinister side.

44:08.813 --> 44:12.899
Although your beady little rat eyes
don't seem like they're taking in the view.

44:13.067 --> 44:15.319
You bust something up
there, sweetheart?!

44:15.486 --> 44:18.447
Does that fuckin' hurt you?!
You fuckin' understand me?!

44:19.699 --> 44:22.534
See, that upsets Joanie now.

44:22.702 --> 44:26.413
"Oh, Cy, do up the boy.
My God, I can't stand to see the other."

44:26.581 --> 44:28.457
You want me to see to the boy, Joanie?

44:28.624 --> 44:30.584
'Cause you know
I'm clay in your hands.

44:30.752 --> 44:32.169
- Cy.
- What is it, Eddie?

44:32.337 --> 44:35.505
- We could all be elsewhere?
- Nothing but true.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.341
Are you awake, Miles?

44:37.508 --> 44:39.843
Don't be fucking
passing out, youngster.

44:40.011 --> 44:44.097
Next breath you draw, the smell of sulfur's
liable to be strong in your nose.

44:44.265 --> 44:47.476
Where is your fucking nose, anyway?

44:47.643 --> 44:49.227
Fuck it, Miles!

44:49.395 --> 44:51.646
You're found fuckin'
guilty of being a cunt.

44:51.814 --> 44:53.565
I'm hereby passing judgment

44:53.733 --> 44:56.401
for your lettin' this bitch
push you around and tell you what to do

44:56.569 --> 44:59.654
when you were supposed to be a man
and showing her the fucking rules!

45:00.948 --> 45:03.700
You hear me, Miles?
Enough of being the cunt you are now,

45:03.868 --> 45:05.911
before you could have been a man,

45:06.079 --> 45:09.081
done your fucking part,
you little piece of shit.

45:10.291 --> 45:12.751
- (whimpers)
- I know you don't want out of here, Joanie.

45:12.919 --> 45:15.796
- Don't hurt her, Cy.
- Don't hurt her?

45:15.963 --> 45:18.090
You mean before I kill her?

45:18.257 --> 45:20.092
Yes.

45:20.259 --> 45:23.303
Listen to that, Flora.
That's the person you robbed,

45:23.471 --> 45:27.224
who had those kind of feelings for you.

45:29.227 --> 45:31.812
But I'm the one you stabbed.

45:31.979 --> 45:36.108
See, I think your fuckin'
skull's broken, Flora.

45:36.275 --> 45:39.528
If you're trying for the knife,
it's maybe a foot to your left.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.324
This is fucking pitiful.

45:47.703 --> 45:51.206
Why don't you put that
out of its misery?

45:55.253 --> 45:57.421
(moaning)

46:03.970 --> 46:05.554
- (gunshot)
- (grunts)

46:09.267 --> 46:12.436
Don't do nothin'.

46:12.603 --> 46:15.730
Whatever you want to do
will be a mistake.

46:15.898 --> 46:19.568
You keep drawing breath right here.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.992
(piano playing)

46:39.797 --> 46:41.798
You did everything you could, EB,

46:41.966 --> 46:44.301
to preserve our fucking interests.

46:44.469 --> 46:46.720
I mean, you know,
sometimes the cards go cold.

46:46.888 --> 46:49.973
Far as the events at the Bella Union,

46:50.141 --> 46:52.517
by all accounts,
it was two young thieves,

46:52.685 --> 46:54.227
a boy and a girl.

46:54.395 --> 46:55.937
We all know who they are.

46:56.105 --> 46:59.441
Who they are now is
late night vittles for Wu's pigs.

46:59.609 --> 47:01.776
That young girl had me fooled.

47:01.944 --> 47:03.445
Your dick had you fooled.

47:03.613 --> 47:05.530
And in that state of addlement,

47:05.698 --> 47:08.033
you mistook her purpose,
her so-called brother's

47:08.201 --> 47:10.827
and their entire fucking cockeyed story.

47:11.871 --> 47:14.206
You did do everything
you could, didn't you, EB?

47:14.373 --> 47:17.375
- You went to the limit on our offer.
- Everything humanly possible.

47:17.543 --> 47:20.712
- You did go to the limit?
- Well, I went to the limit's precipice.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.715
Sounds like you didn't go to the limit.

47:23.883 --> 47:26.635
Al, I held back a few dollars--

47:26.802 --> 47:30.722
- against some final unforeseen turn.
- So we'll never know if them few dollars

47:30.890 --> 47:34.726
you held back wouldn't have
made us both fucking rich.

47:35.728 --> 47:37.771
(retching)

47:40.525 --> 47:41.942
I'm going up.

47:43.569 --> 47:46.321
Find out how much Tolliver paid Wu.

47:48.074 --> 47:51.243
Don't want to be suckin'
hind tit on disposal fees.

48:11.264 --> 48:14.307
Don't think I enjoyed
that bullshit, Joanie.

48:15.726 --> 48:19.062
Certain things you have to do
to impress upon people

48:19.230 --> 48:21.648
what you're willing to do.
Do you like it? No.

48:21.816 --> 48:23.817
Do you enjoy it? No.

48:23.985 --> 48:27.904
Do you have to look
like you do? Yes.

48:29.282 --> 48:31.700
I got Eddie in there.

48:31.867 --> 48:33.326
Gotta let him know.

48:33.494 --> 48:36.413
Capra's downstairs,
gonna hear about it.

48:37.748 --> 48:40.458
When people come to rob you,
Joanie, you gotta get rough.

48:40.626 --> 48:42.794
If it looks like an act,
it's not gonna work.

48:46.382 --> 48:50.635
And then I grab your hand...

48:51.887 --> 48:54.514
and I think, "My God,
this poor fucking girl."

48:56.976 --> 48:59.477
But I did what I had to do in that room.

49:01.647 --> 49:03.189
And now I'm out here.

49:04.609 --> 49:05.859
I'm telling you,

49:06.027 --> 49:08.361
your happiness
is important to me.

49:08.529 --> 49:11.865
And whatever the fuck I gotta do,
if you're too much in my shadow,

49:12.033 --> 49:14.492
if I make things too tough on you,
then we'll stop it.

49:14.660 --> 49:18.038
- We're gonna do something else.
- Cy.

49:18.205 --> 49:21.791
You bring warmth into my life.

49:23.169 --> 49:27.297
I can't bear to see you
unhappy like this.

49:29.967 --> 49:31.635
I want...

49:32.845 --> 49:34.846
to set you up
in your own business here.

49:36.432 --> 49:39.142
Independent fucking operator.
I'll put up the money.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.561
Any kind of interest
in return, that's fine,

49:41.729 --> 49:44.981
but that ain't what this is about.
It'll be your place.

49:45.149 --> 49:46.983
I want you to feel when I walk in there

49:47.151 --> 49:49.653
that you can say, "I'm busy, Cy.
Come back later."

49:49.820 --> 49:52.113
I want you to watch me
turn around when you say that

49:52.281 --> 49:54.866
like I'm some rube trick
with my chin down on the floor.

49:55.034 --> 49:56.868
"When should I try
you again, Joanie?"

49:57.036 --> 50:00.705
"I'll let you know, Cy."
That's how I want you to feel.

50:00.873 --> 50:03.708
I used to make you warm,
didn't I, Cy?

50:03.876 --> 50:07.253
And I could make you feel like
something was funny.

50:07.421 --> 50:09.255
You still do, honey.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.509
When you're happy, you still do.

50:14.595 --> 50:16.721
Kill me too, Cy,

50:16.889 --> 50:18.890
or let me go.

50:21.268 --> 50:23.478
I understood myself to be sayin', Joanie,

50:23.646 --> 50:26.189
I want to find a way
to give you a looser fucking rein.

50:26.357 --> 50:29.067
You've gotta figure out
a way to mean it.

50:29.235 --> 50:31.861
If you don't kill me or let me go,
I'm gonna kill you.

51:50.816 --> 51:54.360
Has he got you at your hands and knees
at 2:00 in the fucking morning?

51:54.528 --> 51:57.113
I got myself on
my hands and knees,

51:57.281 --> 51:59.657
wondering what became of you.

52:12.671 --> 52:14.464
Wake up, David.

52:16.217 --> 52:17.842
