ALL SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY

00:38.167 --> 00:40.100
IN A COURT OF LAW.

00:41.633 --> 00:43.567

00:43.667 --> 00:45.533
I BELIEVE IN WORKING
WITH MY TROOPS,

00:45.633 --> 00:47.033
WORKING WITH THE TEAMS,

00:47.133 --> 00:48.633
BEING OUT ON THE STREET
WITH THE GUYS AND GIRLS.

00:48.733 --> 00:49.900
IT MAKES FOR BETTER TEAMWORK.

00:55.467 --> 00:57.167
WHO ARE WORKING THE STREETS
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:57.267 --> 01:00.567
I CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO DO
SOMETHING I DON'T DO.

01:01.900 --> 01:06.300
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A TRUCK
BLOCKING THE MIDDLE LANE.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.200
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MAY
BE BEHIND A CAR.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.300
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.100
THE DRIVER IS FLAGGING US DOWN.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.300

04:06.100 --> 04:07.667
WHEN SHE STARTED ROLLING

04:07.767 --> 04:09.067
I WAS GETTING READY
TO SMASH THE WINDOW.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.633
IT TOOK OUT MY ASS,
BUT SHE ROLLED, SHE STOPPED,

04:11.733 --> 04:14.067
AND THEN SHE JUST

04:14.167 --> 04:15.333

05:15.833 --> 05:17.300
-OKAY. COME ON.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.267
-DID YOU EVEN LET ME ANSWER?

WE CAN DO IT RIGHT HERE.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.333
TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN,
WRAP YOUR LIPS

05:26.433 --> 05:27.700
AROUND THE SMALL TUBE,
BLOW STRONG AND HARD

05:27.800 --> 05:29.333
UNTIL I TELL YOU TO STOP.

05:29.433 --> 05:31.733
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING...

05:31.833 --> 05:34.700
IT'S GONNA FEEL LIKE
IT'S TAKING ALL THE AIR
OUT OF YOU.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.600
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING...

05:36.700 --> 05:38.567
ALMOST THERE.
A FEW MORE SECONDS.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.633
ALL RIGHT, JENNIFER.
WE'RE LOOKING AT...

05:44.733 --> 05:50.233
YOUR TWO BREATH TEST RESULTS
ARE A .148 AND A .144, OKAY?

05:50.333 --> 05:51.567
-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

05:51.667 --> 05:54.067
-THE LEGAL LIMIT
IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA
IS A .08.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.100
SO YOU ARE NEARLY
TWICE THE LEGAL LIMIT.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.167
THE TWO BEERS AT 5:00
DOESN'T QUITE ADD UP.

05:59.267 --> 06:02.367
-IMMEDIATELY UPON CONTACT,
I COULD SMELL THE ODOR

06:02.467 --> 06:04.133
OF AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE
COMING OFF OF HER.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.100
I REALLY DIDN'T SEE
HER EYES TOO CLEARLY,

06:06.200 --> 06:08.067
BUT I COULD JUST GET
THE STRONG ODOR AT FIRST.

06:08.133 --> 06:09.733
AND THEN WE WERE OUT OF THE CAR.
THAT WAS IT.

06:09.833 --> 06:12.533
SHE WAS AGAINST THE CAR,
AND ALL OF THE OTHER
BACKUP UNITS STARTED TO SHOW UP.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.067
AT THAT POINT, WE STOPPED
AND WAITED FOR YOU.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.333
-OKAY. I'LL ISSUE THE CITATIONS
FOR STOPPING IN THE ROAD.

06:18.433 --> 06:19.700

06:21.967 --> 06:23.233
-Officer:

I KNOW IT'S TOUGH
FOR MY WIFE DISPATCHING ME

06:34.933 --> 06:38.300
NOT KNOWING THE OUTCOME
TILL I'M ABLE TO TEXT HER

06:38.400 --> 06:41.200
OR LET HER KNOW VIA RADIO
WHAT'S GOING ON.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.200
WE'RE GOING TO
A SUSPICIOUS CALL

06:45.300 --> 06:49.567
IN REFERENCE TO A MALE SUSPECT
RUNNING AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
YELLING FOR HELP.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.433
WE'RE JUST AROUND THE CORNER,
SO WE'RE GONNA TRY

06:51.533 --> 06:53.667
TO GET THERE QUICK
AND LOCATE THE MALE SUSPECT.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.767
-(police radio chatter)

06:58.067 --> 06:59.567
-(car door opens)

07:04.133 --> 07:05.867
-OH, THERE'S A GUY
DOWN RIGHT THERE.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.133
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:07.233 --> 07:08.300

07:13.567 --> 07:15.067

07:15.167 --> 07:17.467
-'CAUSE THEY WAS BEATING ME
AND I HAD TO RUN.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.267
AND HE WAS CHOKING ME.
I CAN'T BREATHE.

07:19.367 --> 07:20.433
-ARE YOU HURT AT ALL?

07:20.533 --> 07:21.633
-YEAH.
-WHERE ARE YOU HURT AT?

07:21.733 --> 07:23.867
-MY ARMS, MY HEAD.

07:23.967 --> 07:26.667
SHE WAS LIKE CUTTING
MY HAIR WITH A KNIFE.

07:26.767 --> 07:29.633
AND HE WAS PUNCHING ME
IN MY STOMACH AND MY FACE.

07:29.733 --> 07:31.200
I BARELY GOT AWAY.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.367
-WHERE ARE YOU COMING FROM?

07:32.467 --> 07:33.867
-I LIVE ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN,

07:33.967 --> 07:35.700
BUT THEY, LIKE,
KIDNAPPED ME.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.433
-ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN
IN LEHIGH?

07:37.533 --> 07:39.467
-YEAH, I LIVE OFF

07:43.067 --> 07:45.633
THEY LIVE A COUPLE

07:45.733 --> 07:47.367
AND THEY TOOK ME THERE

07:47.467 --> 07:48.633
TO TIE ME UP.

07:48.733 --> 07:49.900
-WHY'D THEY TIE YOU UP?

07:50.067 --> 07:52.100
-THEY SAID THAT I TOLD
SOMEBODY WHERE THEY LIVED,

07:52.200 --> 07:53.733
THAT I SNITCHED ON THEM
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.267
-WHY, WHAT WERE THEY DOING?

07:55.367 --> 07:57.367
-I GUESS HE ROBBED SOMEBODY,

07:57.467 --> 07:59.900
AND HE SAID THAT I TOLD THEM

ONE OF OUR CANINE UNITS
IS FAMILIAR WITH THIS GENTLEMAN,

08:19.667 --> 08:20.967
AND WE'RE GONNA GO

08:21.067 --> 08:23.133

08:23.233 --> 08:24.733
THAT'S A BLACK BMW RIGHT THERE.

08:52.367 --> 08:53.933
-(Man speaks indistinctly)
-OKAY.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.467
COME ON OVER HERE FOR ME.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.400
STEP TO THIS CAR, OKAY?

08:57.500 --> 08:58.767
-I GOT YOU.

08:58.867 --> 09:00.733
-JUST KEEP YOUR HANDS
ON THAT CAR, OKAY?
TURN AROUND.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.267
JUST TURN AROUND, THANK YOU.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.700
WHO ELSE IS IN THERE?

09:03.800 --> 09:05.167
I JUST WENT-- NEXT DOOR.

09:05.267 --> 09:06.667
-MY FRIEND, KENNETH--

09:06.767 --> 09:07.767
-(police radio chatter)

09:07.867 --> 09:10.433
-MY FIANCEE, AND MY KIDS.

09:10.533 --> 09:11.767
-OKAY.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.933
-THERE'S ONE OTHER PERSON
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

09:14.067 --> 09:15.400
WHERE'S HE AT?

09:15.500 --> 09:17.133
-YOU KNOW WHO
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

09:17.233 --> 09:18.567
DON'T LIE TO US.

09:18.667 --> 09:21.067
-THAT BMW, WHO WAS
DRIVING THE BMW?

09:21.100 --> 09:22.667
-THESE ARE OUR ONLY
TWO CARS, SIR.

09:22.767 --> 09:23.767
-OKAY.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.367
-GO OVER TO THAT DEPUTY
OVER THERE, GO.

09:25.467 --> 09:26.733
GO. GO.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.533
LISTEN, IS THERE ANYBODY
ELSE IN THE HOUSE?

09:29.633 --> 09:31.633
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST
'CAUSE I'M GONNA GO IN THERE
AND SEARCH.

09:31.733 --> 09:33.367
-LISTEN, CAN I GET
MY DOG, PLEASE?
BEFORE Y'ALL--

09:33.467 --> 09:35.200
-SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
IN THE HOUSE.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.900
-NO, SIR.

09:37.067 --> 09:38.800
-WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY
TO GET HURT, BRO. YOU HAVE
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.267
-ME NEITHER. I WANT
TO GET MY DOG.

09:40.367 --> 09:41.867
-SO WHO ELSE

09:41.967 --> 09:43.433

09:43.533 --> 09:44.633
MY DOG.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.133
-LEE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE!

09:48.233 --> 09:49.800
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE,

YOUR HANDS UP!

09:51.167 --> 09:52.467

TO THE LEFT GOING IN.

09:52.567 --> 09:53.600
-(mumbles)

09:57.833 --> 09:59.833
-JUST SHUT THAT DOOR,
HE CAN'T COME OUT.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.067
-(door opens)

10:09.633 --> 10:10.600
-THERE HE IS!

10:10.700 --> 10:12.067

10:14.667 --> 10:15.667
-MY HANDS BROKE! NO, STOP!

10:15.767 --> 10:17.000
-LAY DOWN, LAY DOWN!

10:17.100 --> 10:18.667

10:24.400 --> 10:26.367

10:33.067 --> 10:34.433
-HERE, HERE, HERE!

10:34.533 --> 10:35.700
GET IT!

10:35.800 --> 10:37.100
I PROMISE IT'S BROKE.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.533
-COMING OUT.

10:38.633 --> 10:40.067
-I PROMISE IT'S BROKE.
LOOK AT MY HAND.

10:40.167 --> 10:41.867
LOOK AT MY HAND,
IT'S BROKE.

10:41.967 --> 10:43.400
-THEY ALL LIE.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.600
-OW, SIR.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.867
-(all chattering)
-HIDING IN THE BATHROOM.

10:46.967 --> 10:49.933
-MAURICE?
DO WE HAVE MAURICE?

10:50.033 --> 10:51.233
-HEY!

10:51.333 --> 10:52.700
PUT HIM IN HANDCUFFS.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.933
GOING TO JAIL, HE'S GOING
TO JAIL TOO FOR OBSTRUCTION.

10:55.033 --> 10:56.233
-(chattering)

10:56.333 --> 10:57.633
-SIT.
-SIT DOWN.

10:57.733 --> 10:58.933
-WAIT.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.600
-CROSS YOUR LEGS.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.433
ALL RIGHT, DUDE. WELL YOU COULD
HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
A LONG TIME AGO.

11:03.533 --> 11:05.233
SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
A LONG TIME AGO.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.533
-WHEN WE ANNOUNCED
"SHERIFF'S OFFICE," WHY DIDN'T
YOU COME OUT?

11:07.633 --> 11:09.067
-I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.
-NO?

11:09.167 --> 11:10.833
-YOU COULDN'T HEAR
"SHERIFF'S OFFICE"? DUDE,
I WAS YELLING IT.

11:10.933 --> 11:12.467
-I SAID IT PRETTY LOUD AS WELL.

11:12.567 --> 11:15.067
YOU GUYS HANG OUT
IN THE BATHROOM NORMALLY
WITH FRIENDS?

11:15.167 --> 11:16.867
YOU DIDN'T HEAR US ANNOUNCE
"SHERIFF'S OFFICE"?

11:16.967 --> 11:18.867
-NOT UNTIL, LIKE,
THE LAST TIME YOU SAID IT.

11:19.933 --> 11:21.567
-WE WERE YELLING IT
PRETTY LOUD, MAN.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.767
-HEY BROTHER-IN-LAW,
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T TELL US
ANYBODY WAS IN THE HOUSE?

11:23.867 --> 11:25.467
-DEAD SLEEPING.
-ASLEEP.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.467
-YOU WERE ASLEEP,
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHO
WAS IN YOUR HOUSE?

11:27.567 --> 11:28.800
-NO, SIR.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.900
-THEY JUST OPENED THE DOOR
AND MADE THEMSELVES AT HOME?

11:31.067 --> 11:33.367
-YOU GUYS SAW.
-IN YOUR BATHROOM
IN YOUR MASTER BEDROOM?

11:33.467 --> 11:34.900
-YES, SIR, AND...

11:35.067 --> 11:36.767
-I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHO Y'ALL WERE LOOKING FOR.

11:36.867 --> 11:37.967
-WHO'S BEEMER IS THAT? YOURS?

11:38.067 --> 11:39.267
-NO, SIR.

11:39.367 --> 11:40.867
-HOW DID YOU GUYS GET HERE
IF YOU GUYS JUST GOT HERE?

11:40.967 --> 11:42.500
-I GOT DROPPED OFF
AROUND 6:00.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.200
-OKAY. HOW ABOUT YOU TWO,
HOW'D YOU GUYS GET HERE?

11:44.300 --> 11:45.667
-WE GOT DROPPED OFF, OFFICER.

11:45.767 --> 11:47.433
-YOU GOT DROPPED OFF?
BY WHO?

11:47.533 --> 11:49.367
-MY GIRL.

11:49.467 --> 11:51.067
-YOU AIN'T GOT NO
INJURIES ON YOU?

11:51.133 --> 11:53.500
-LOOK, LOOK AT THE FACE,
LOOK AT MY HANDS. SEE THAT?

11:54.833 --> 11:56.200
-HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
GO TO A HOSPITAL?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.367
-I WAS ON MY WAY.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.567
-HUH?
-I WAS ON MY WAY.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.167
-HOW ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY
IF YOU'RE IN A BATHROOM?

12:00.267 --> 12:01.767
-YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY
HIDING IN A BATHROOM?

12:01.867 --> 12:02.933
-I WAS WAITING ON MY RIDE.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.300
-IN A BATHROOM?

12:04.400 --> 12:06.167
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.833
-SO YOUR GIRLFRIEND--
YOU JUST SAID YOUR GIRLFRIEND
DROPPED YOU OFF HERE.

12:09.933 --> 12:12.167
SO YOUR GIRLFRIEND DROPPED
YOU OFF TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER RIDE

12:12.267 --> 12:14.567
TO TAKE YOU TO A HOSPITAL
FOR A BROKEN HAND?

12:14.667 --> 12:17.667
-NO, BECAUSE SHE HAD
TO TAKE MY DAUGHTER,
DROP MY DAUGHTER OFF.

12:17.767 --> 12:21.067
-MMM. IF YOU ALREADY KNOW
YOU'RE IN A BIND, HONESTY
IS THE BEST WAY.

12:21.133 --> 12:23.233
BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO THAT ROUTE,

12:23.333 --> 12:25.200
YOU'RE JUST GONNA DIG YOURSELF
IN A BIGGER HOLE.

12:27.233 --> 12:30.800
-SO WHAT HAPPENED?
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW, LIKE,
YOU GOT AWAY AND STUFF?

12:30.900 --> 12:34.767
UM, THE GUY SENT HIS GIRLFRIEND
TO GET MORE ZIP TIES

12:34.867 --> 12:36.900
TO TRY TO TIE ME BACK UP.

12:37.067 --> 12:40.500
AND, UH, HE WAS ALREADY
FATIGUED BECAUSE I GUESS
HE'S BIGGER THAN ME,

12:40.600 --> 12:43.967
FIGHTING WITH ME, AND I GOT
A CHANCE TO BREAK LOOSE
AND I RAN.

12:44.067 --> 12:49.133
AND, UM, I GOT TO A NEIGHBOR'S
HOUSE AND WAS ABLE TO CALL THE
LEE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

12:49.233 --> 12:51.400
-YEAH? WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, OKAY?

12:51.500 --> 12:53.067
-ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
-ALL RIGHT, MAN, GOOD LUCK.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.100
GOT THE ZIP TIES.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.567
THE CAR MATCHES THE DESCRIPTION
OF THE VEHICLE THAT WE WERE
LOOKING FOR. SO...

13:02.667 --> 13:04.733
-WE'RE GONNA CHARGE HIM WITH
PROBABLY KIDNAPPING,

13:04.833 --> 13:07.800
AGG. ASSAULT, AND AT LEAST
OBSTRUCTION FOR THE PEOPLE
THAT DIDN'T LET US IN THE HOUSE.

13:07.900 --> 13:11.267
-WE'LL HAVE THE DETECTIVES
COME OUT, AND THEY'LL TAKE
EVERYTHING OVER FROM US.

13:13.867 --> 13:15.467
Officer:
FIRST NAME IS ADRIAN.

13:15.567 --> 13:17.533
GOT THAT NAME
FROM MY MOTHER BECAUSE,

13:17.633 --> 13:19.400
AT THE TIME OF HER PREGNANCY,

13:19.500 --> 13:23.267
MOTHER THOROUGHLY ENJOYED
A SHOW CALLED "HIGHLANDER."

13:23.367 --> 13:26.067
AND THE CHARACTER ON THE SHOW,

13:26.100 --> 13:28.100
HIS NAME JUST HAPPENED
TO BE ADRIAN,

13:28.200 --> 13:30.767
AND IT JUST SEEMED
TO WORK OUT WELL FOR HER.

13:30.867 --> 13:32.633
-(police radio chatter)

13:32.733 --> 13:36.733
-SPOTTED A BROWN-COLORED
VEHICLE UP HERE,
WEAVING IN AND OUT OF TRAFFIC

13:36.833 --> 13:38.400
PRETTY ERRATICALLY.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.467
TRY TO GET THIS VEHICLE STOPPED,
SEE WHAT THEY GOT GOING ON.

13:41.567 --> 13:45.467
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA
TAKE OFF, BUT WE'RE PULLING IN.

13:45.567 --> 13:48.067
RIGHT HERE, JUST
OUTSIDE THE BI-LO

13:48.100 --> 13:50.333
ON SAINT ANDREWS,
OCCUPIED TWICE.

13:52.367 --> 13:54.200
-(door closes)

13:57.800 --> 13:59.267
-SOMETHING WRONG?

13:59.367 --> 14:02.500
-NO, SIR. I'M JUST HONESTLY
GOING TO PICK UP MY BEST FRIEND.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.633
-YOU'RE JUST HONESTLY GOING
TO PICK UP YOUR BEST FRIEND?

14:04.733 --> 14:05.800
-YES, SIR.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.433
-HOW WE DOIN' TODAY?

14:07.533 --> 14:09.367
-I JUST TOLD HER TO SLOW DOWN
A COUPLE MINUTES AGO.

14:09.467 --> 14:11.167
-WHY-- WHY--
THE WINDOW DON'T WORK?

14:11.267 --> 14:12.700
-NO, SIR. IT DOESN'T.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.500
I'M SORRY. I'M VERY POOR,

14:14.600 --> 14:15.933
TO BE HONEST.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.433
-OKAY.
-I HAVE A ROUGH LIFE,

14:17.533 --> 14:18.800
TO BE HONEST.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.767
-YOU LIVE A ROUGH LIFE,
TO BE HONEST?
-YES, SIR.

14:20.867 --> 14:22.400
-WHERE YOU COMING FROM?

14:22.500 --> 14:24.300
-I'M COMING FROM ERMO.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.900
-ERMO? OKAY.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.500
STEP OUT OF THE CAR
HERE FOR ME.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.933
STEP BACK HERE FOR ME.

14:29.067 --> 14:30.067
-YES, SIR.

14:30.133 --> 14:31.700
I'M FINE.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.067
-YOU'RE FINE?
-YES, SIR.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.267
-ARE YOU SURE? OKAY.
-I'M POSITIVE.

14:34.367 --> 14:35.900
-STEP BACK HERE,
STEP BACK HERE, STEP BACK HERE.

14:36.067 --> 14:37.800
OKAY, I'M GONNA TELL YOU NOW,

14:37.900 --> 14:40.167
AND I'M JUST GONNA BE
100 PERCENT STRAIGHT WITH YOU.

14:40.267 --> 14:43.100
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT YOU
THAT SAYS THAT YOU'RE FINE
RIGHT NOW.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.700
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.533
YOU HAVE ONE--
STOP. LISTEN TO ME.
LET ME TALK.

14:47.633 --> 14:49.733
YOU HAVE ONE OPPORTUNITY
TO BE HONEST WITH ME

14:49.833 --> 14:51.600
AND TELL ME WHAT THE DEAL IS.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.500
-I LIVE A ROUGH LIFE, SIR.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.200
UM...

14:55.300 --> 14:58.100
IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME
TO TALK ABOUT IF YOU WANT
ME TO BE HONEST.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.967
NO, I DON'T-- I JUST WANT
TO KNOW WHY YOU'RE SO NERVOUS

15:02.067 --> 15:04.667
AND WHY YOU'RE ACTING THE WAY
THAT YOU'RE ACTING RIGHT NOW.

15:04.767 --> 15:05.967
IS THERE ANYTHING ILLEGAL
INSIDE THE CAR?

15:06.067 --> 15:07.600
-NO, SIR.
-ARE YOU SURE?

15:07.700 --> 15:09.100
-SWEAR TO GOD.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.667
I PROMISE TO YOU ON
MY GRANDPARENTS' GRAVES.

15:11.767 --> 15:13.067
-THERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL
INSIDE THE CAR?

15:13.167 --> 15:14.667
-NO, SIR.
-WHO IS THIS GENTLEMAN HERE?

15:14.767 --> 15:15.933
-THAT'S MY BOYFRIEND.

15:16.067 --> 15:17.167
-THAT'S YOUR BOYFRIEND?
-YES, SIR.

15:17.267 --> 15:18.733
-OKAY.
-AND, UM...

15:18.833 --> 15:21.200
I LIVE A ROUGH LIFE
AND I, UM, LIVE ON MY OWN.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.267
I'VE BEEN LIVING ON MY OWN
SINCE I WAS 15.

15:23.367 --> 15:25.233
-OKAY.
-YES, SIR.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.667
-IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ME,
I WOULD LOVE IT--

15:27.767 --> 15:29.333
-WHY ARE YOU DRIVING THE WAY
THAT YOU'RE DRIVING?

15:29.433 --> 15:30.533
IS YOUR LICENSE SUSPENDED?

15:30.633 --> 15:31.767
-NO, SIR, IT'S NOT.
CHECK ME.

15:31.867 --> 15:33.367
-DO YOU HAVE WARRANTS?
-NO, SIR.

15:33.467 --> 15:34.867
NOT AT ALL.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.133
-OKAY. DO YOU USE
ANY KIND OF DRUGS?

15:37.233 --> 15:38.933
-NO, SIR.
-DON'T SMOKE ANY MARIJUANA?

15:39.067 --> 15:40.867
YOU DON'T USE ANY KIND OF DRUGS
THAT REQUIRE A NEEDLE?

15:40.967 --> 15:42.367
-NO, SIR.

15:42.467 --> 15:43.767
-AND I'M NOT GONNA FIND
ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT
INSIDE THE CAR?

15:43.867 --> 15:45.267
-NO, SIR.
-OKAY.

15:45.367 --> 15:46.600
-SWEAR TO YOU.

15:46.700 --> 15:49.200
-I'M GONNA ASK YOU JUST LIKE
I ASKED HER.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.867
IS THERE ANYTHING ILLEGAL
INSIDE THE CAR?

15:50.967 --> 15:52.367
-UH, NOT THAT I KNOW ABOUT.

15:52.467 --> 15:54.167
I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE SPAZZED
WHEN YOU OPENED THE DOOR.

15:54.267 --> 15:55.600
THAT THREW ME OFF
SAME AS IT THREW YOU OFF.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.567
SHE SOUNDS EXTREMELY NERVOUS
AND NOT SURE AND UNSURE.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.067
-HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN HER?

16:00.133 --> 16:02.633
-UH, I HAVEN'T HUNG OUT WITH HER
IN, LIKE, FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS.

16:02.733 --> 16:04.100
-WAS THAT ALCOHOL
INSIDE THAT CUP?

16:04.200 --> 16:05.500
-NO, OFFICER, IT'S NOT.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.167
-SO WHO'S BEEN DRINKING? YOU?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.600
-NO, SIR.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.400
-WHO'S BEEN DRINKING?
-YOU CAN BREATHALYZE ME.
I'LL BLOW ZEROS.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.133
-AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DRINKING?
SO WHY AM I SMELLING ALCOHOL?

16:13.233 --> 16:15.333
OKAY. AGAIN...

16:15.433 --> 16:17.333
I'M DONE ASKING.

16:17.433 --> 16:20.967
-SIR, I HAVE BEEN DRINKING
WAY EARLIER, BUT I HAVEN'T
DRANK IN AWHILE.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.733
-OKAY. I'M GONNA SEARCH
YOUR CAR, JUST LIKE I SAID.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.200
I ASKED YOU TO BE
HONEST WITH ME.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.400
-I HAVE BEEN, SIR.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.567
-OKAY, COOL. COOL.
-NO LIE.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.633
-WE'LL SEARCH THE CAR HERE.

16:31.733 --> 16:33.333
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER
SAYS THAT...

16:34.900 --> 16:37.167
SHE'S DIRTY. YOU GOT
VISINE HERE.

16:37.267 --> 16:40.333
YOU GOT LITTLE CRUMBS
OF MARIJUANA IN THE BOTTOM
OF THAT.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.467
-AND I KNOW WHAT IT IS
AND I NEVER WANT TO OBEY--

16:44.567 --> 16:47.133
ALL I WANT TO DO IS JUST OBEY.

16:47.233 --> 16:48.500
AND, UM...

16:48.600 --> 16:50.600
ALL I AM DOING IS GOING
TO PICK UP MY BEST FRIEND.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.700
-I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
YOU LITERALLY FROZE.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.767
LIKE YOU TURNED INTO
A FREAKING STONE--

16:54.867 --> 16:56.567
-BECAUSE I RESPECT THEM.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.100
-NO, YOU WERE GENUINELY SCARED.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.067
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN RESPECT AND BEING
SCARED GENUINELY.

17:01.100 --> 17:03.367
-I'M NOT SCARED,
I JUST RESPECT...

17:03.467 --> 17:05.067
-ALL RIGHT.
-...THE LAW.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.500
NOT TO LIE.
I DON'T KNOW.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.667
THAT'S JUST ME.

17:10.767 --> 17:11.900
-THIS VODKA BELONG TO YOU?

17:12.067 --> 17:13.067
-YES, SIR.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.800
-BUT IT'S IN YOUR CAR.
-YES, SIR.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.500
BUT YOU CAN TAKE THE VODKA.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.733
-HUH?

17:17.833 --> 17:19.167
-YOU CAN HAVE THAT.

17:19.267 --> 17:20.467
-WHY WOULD I WANT THAT?

17:20.567 --> 17:21.733
-WELL...

17:21.833 --> 17:23.367
-(boyfriend laughs)

17:23.467 --> 17:25.200
-YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET IN TROUBLE FOR IT.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.500
-YES, SIR, BECAUSE I, UM...

17:27.600 --> 17:30.133
I'M JUST TRYING TO PICK HER UP
FROM GETTING HER TATTOO.
THAT'S ALL.

17:30.233 --> 17:32.167
I WATCHED HER KIDS TODAY.

17:32.267 --> 17:33.667
AND I'M BEING HONEST.

17:33.767 --> 17:35.133
-CAN YOU SEARCH AROUND FOR ME?

17:35.233 --> 17:37.333
LET ME RUN BOTH THEIR NAMES
AND STUFF.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.333
(sighs) THAT'S WHY
SHE'S SO NERVOUS.

17:40.433 --> 17:45.700
SHE'S WANTED FOR
A HIT AND RUN OUT OF
COLUMBIA POLICE DEPARTMENT

17:45.800 --> 17:47.167
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.100
THEY ACTUALLY ENTERED
THE WARRANT TODAY.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.067
YOU DONE SEARCHING HER?

17:54.933 --> 17:57.833
YOU DONE? 69 FLEMINGS, 72.

17:57.933 --> 17:59.900
C.P.D. DOES THAT HIT AND RUN.

18:00.067 --> 18:01.400
HAD THAT HIT AND RUN WARRANT.

18:01.500 --> 18:05.100
THEY'RE GONNA HEAD OUT HERE
TO COME PICK HER UP RIGHT NOW.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.233
-SHE PICKED ME UP.
WE STARTED RACING AROUND,

18:09.333 --> 18:11.233
TALKING ABOUT, "WE NEED TO FIND
A LIQUOR STORE."

18:11.333 --> 18:12.867
AND THE WAY SHE WAS ACTING,
I TOLD HER, MAN,

18:12.967 --> 18:15.300
SHE MIGHT BE FREAKING A LITTLE
OVER THE ALCOHOLIC SIDE.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.900
-OKAY.
-YOU KNOW, JUST THE WAY...

18:17.067 --> 18:18.633
IT SOUNDED MORE OF A NEED
AT THAT POINT THAN A WANT.

18:18.733 --> 18:19.900
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
-I UNDERSTAND.

18:20.067 --> 18:21.900
GONNA TALK TO HER REAL QUICK.

18:23.933 --> 18:25.633
-CAN I PAY IT?
-HUH?

18:25.733 --> 18:26.833
-CAN I PAY IT?

18:26.933 --> 18:28.067
-WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO PAY IT.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.667
-CAN I PLEASE PAY IT
RIGHT NOW?

18:29.767 --> 18:31.900
-YOU CAN'T PAY IT
RIGHT NOW. HOW MUCH
HAVE YOU HAD TO DRINK TODAY?

18:32.067 --> 18:35.633
-I HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH.
I'M JUST SCARED BECAUSE I NEVER
KNEW ABOUT THIS, SIR.

18:35.733 --> 18:37.133
-OKAY, WELL, I MEAN, IT'S--

18:37.233 --> 18:38.600
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.333
-IT IS, BUT I HAVE
A CARD THOUGH.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.933
-LISTEN, YOUR ERRATIC DRIVING
AND YOUR BEHAVIOR--

18:43.067 --> 18:44.533
-(whines)

18:44.633 --> 18:47.733
-EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU SAYS THAT
ALCOHOL HAS MADE THIS A BAD DAY
FOR YOU.

18:47.833 --> 18:49.067
-IT'S NOT THAT, SIR.

18:49.167 --> 18:50.967
-OKAY? THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS.

18:51.067 --> 18:53.967
-I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
I HAVE THAT. THAT'S WHAT
I'M TELLING YOU.

18:54.067 --> 18:56.067
-BUT YOU DO.
YOU HAVE A WARRANT.

18:56.167 --> 18:57.500
-UGH!

18:57.600 --> 19:00.067
-DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
ANYTHING ABOUT IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:00.100 --> 19:02.067
-NO, SIR. I DON'T EVEN
KNOW ABOUT IT.

19:02.167 --> 19:03.133
I NEVER KNEW.

19:03.233 --> 19:04.467
-IT'S A WARRANT FOR
A HIT AND RUN.

19:04.567 --> 19:05.967
-I NEVER KNEW ABOUT IT, SIR.

19:06.067 --> 19:08.733
-OKAY, SO WHY WOULD THEY
GET YOUR NAME AND PUT
THAT CHARGE ON YOU?

19:08.833 --> 19:10.533
-BECAUSE SOMEONE DID THAT.

19:10.633 --> 19:12.867
I'M ASSUMING THAT
SOMEONE KNEW ME.

19:12.967 --> 19:15.667
AND I NEVER DID IT.
I SWEAR. I SWEAR TO GOD.

19:15.767 --> 19:17.733
-SO YOU'RE SAYING SOMEBODY PUT
YOUR NAME DOWN--

19:17.833 --> 19:19.067
-YES! I'M TELLING YOU.

19:19.167 --> 19:21.067
-SO SOMEBODY FRAMED YOU?
-YES, SIR.

19:21.167 --> 19:23.233
-AND GOT CHARGED WITH A HIT
AND RUN. THEY PUT THE WARRANT
ON YOU?

19:23.333 --> 19:25.567
-I PROMISE. I PINKY PROMISE.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.167
I DON'T MEAN TO FREAK OUT.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.133
THE ONLY REASON I FREAK OUT
IS BECAUSE I LOVE SO MUCH.

19:30.233 --> 19:31.833
AND I WANT A LIFE.

19:31.933 --> 19:34.900
AND I'M TRYING
AND I'M GOING TO SCHOOL
AND I'M DOING ALL THIS.

19:35.067 --> 19:36.833
-ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'M NOT
GONNA BE A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

19:36.933 --> 19:39.833
OR A LIFE COACH,
BUT I'M GONNA TELL YOU
THE FIRST PART

19:39.933 --> 19:41.267
IS TO STOP DRINKING...

19:41.367 --> 19:42.633
-YES, SIR, AND I PROMISE.
-...AND DRIVING.

19:42.733 --> 19:43.900
-YES, SIR.

19:44.067 --> 19:45.800
-COLUMBIA POLICE DEPARTMENT
IS GONNA COME GET YOU.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.700
THEY'RE GONNA HOUSE YOU,
AND THEN YOU CAN GO
FROM THERE.

19:48.733 --> 19:51.300
- Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.267
- Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:53.367 --> 19:54.300
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.367
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:02.933 --> 20:05.767
- Dispatcher:
OKAY, WE'LL STILL SEND
A CODE THREE.

20:05.867 --> 20:07.333
- (theme music playing)
