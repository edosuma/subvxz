03:16.906 --> 03:20.208
Go on, do your prayers, Eddie. Go on.

03:21.535 --> 03:27.716
God bless Mama and Daddy
and the farm. Amen.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.854
- Mama.
- Mmm-hmm?

03:41.263 --> 03:45.442
- What's wrong with Daddy tonight?
- Nothing, Eddie.

03:45.809 --> 03:48.570
You mind me and you go
right to sleep, you hear?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.349
Will it be all right?

04:59.842 --> 05:01.768
Should I be afraid?

06:04.948 --> 06:09.911
Tom Harley. Open up, Tom.
It's me, Clayton Heller. Tom.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.341
Please open the door.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.836
For God's sakes, Tom.
Open up, please!

06:18.837 --> 06:20.922
It's after me, Tom.
It's gonna get me.

06:20.923 --> 06:24.425
God in heaven, Tom.
We can't just sit here.

06:24.426 --> 06:28.554
We have to, Ellie. This has
nothing to do with us.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.599
What kind of a Christian
are you, for God's sakes?

06:31.600 --> 06:33.768
- You got to help me, Harley!
- Tom.

06:33.769 --> 06:36.270
- Mama.
- See to the boy.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.106
Tom, it's gonna get me if
you don't open the door!

06:38.107 --> 06:41.901
For God's sake, please help me! Tom.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.821
Why doesn't Daddy let the man in?

06:44.822 --> 06:49.959
- Please open the door!
- He can't, baby. He just can't.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.800
Get away from my door.

06:57.960 --> 07:01.629
- Get away from me and my family!
- Tom, please!

07:03.090 --> 07:05.767
You got to help me, Tom.

07:06.218 --> 07:10.430
It's coming. I didn't kill that girl.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.182
I don't know nothing about that,
and I don't want to.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.977
They said I did, Tom. But I didn't.

07:15.978 --> 07:20.398
Now, I'm sorry. I am. But I can't
risk my family for you, Clayton.

07:20.399 --> 07:23.109
Now, I got my shotgun here.

07:23.110 --> 07:27.163
Get away. Get away
afore I have to use it.

08:26.048 --> 08:29.183
Gypsy, ready? Ready?

08:31.220 --> 08:34.480
Pick it up. Come here. Come on.

08:35.807 --> 08:39.736
All right, ready? Go get it.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.202
Come on.

09:00.791 --> 09:04.177
Now, young man, come up here.

09:06.213 --> 09:10.049
- I thank you. What've you been doing?
- Playing with Gypsy.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.592
Mmm-hmm.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.728
That's good.

09:15.556 --> 09:18.099
You know something?
When I was your age,

09:18.100 --> 09:21.060
your great-grandmama
used to wash my hands.

09:21.061 --> 09:25.606
And she was so old that the skin on
her hands was thin as tissue paper.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.909
It felt so good.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.780
Guess what?

09:32.781 --> 09:37.201
Last one in the house will get the
privilege of washing the breakfast dishes.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.504
Get out of town.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.177
Come on, Gypsy.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.606
- Not at the table, Billy.
- But he's awful hungry, Daddy.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.950
Put it in the bowl.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.212
- Is it story time?
- I reckon.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.590
Wait. I got to get something.

10:27.502 --> 10:30.254
- Daddy?
- Hold on.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.266
- I made you a present.
- You did?

10:35.469 --> 10:37.812
I like presents.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.859
Oh, well. Now, this is something.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.988
It goes around your neck.

10:47.731 --> 10:50.066
This is something special.

10:50.067 --> 10:53.027
- You really like it?
- I love it.

10:53.028 --> 10:56.656
You don't have to wear it every day
or nothing. Just when it strikes you.

10:56.657 --> 11:00.918
Give me a hug. I ain't
never taking it off, punk.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.578
All right, now, wait a minute.

11:02.579 --> 11:05.998
Once upon a time,
there was this scruffy old man,

11:05.999 --> 11:09.927
and you know, he was one of
them yes-and-no kind of guys.

11:10.212 --> 11:13.673
So anyhow, he was very proud
'cause he had this very clever son,

11:13.674 --> 11:15.216
and he knew that one day,

11:15.217 --> 11:18.594
this son was gonna grow up
to be something very special.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.688
So, and one day...

11:23.809 --> 11:27.728
Really, Tracy. You know, Joel is a
great guy once you get to know him.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.281
Honey, get me a beer.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.992
So how much further is
it to the cabin, Steve?

11:41.993 --> 11:43.878
About 50 miles.

11:46.957 --> 11:50.334
Why do you always have to
carry that stupid rifle with you?

11:50.335 --> 11:54.222
'Cause you never know what you're
gonna find in the jungle, yo.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.850
- Sorry.
- Thank you, klutz.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.661
Okay, come on.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.891
- Let her rip.
- Now?

12:39.593 --> 12:42.270
Get the potatoes, kid.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.529
Sweet potatoes.
Come on, get it over there.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.488
- Wait, Steve, pull over.
- What?

13:00.489 --> 13:04.241
- I want to take a picture of this.
- These people can get pretty weird, Trace.

13:04.242 --> 13:08.078
We heard a story a couple years
ago about a guy who killed his wife

13:08.079 --> 13:10.289
and ate her just to get
rid of the evidence.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.916
- Yeah.
- That's disgusting.

13:11.917 --> 13:15.044
No, the cops found, like,
her foot or something in this big pot

13:15.045 --> 13:18.422
with all these carrots and onions.
It was like foot stew.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.550
You know, I think this
was the guy, too.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.936
This was the guy.

13:25.597 --> 13:29.692
Get a few more of these. Here you go.
Get a few more of them, boy.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.853
All right, here we are.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.606
- Where?
- Downtown Bradley Mountain.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.951
Cabin's the next stop.
Just a few miles from here.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.736
- Kimbo.
- Yeah?

13:40.737 --> 13:42.872
Help me out.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.494
This is your last chance to shop, lady.
Breathe deep. The air is clean.

13:48.495 --> 13:52.164
- You guys are animals.
- Civilization is behind us.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.216
No, Gypsy!

13:54.793 --> 13:56.710
- Hook shot.
- No, Gypsy.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.139
- Whoa! Nice dog.
- No.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.433
Gypsy!

14:04.177 --> 14:06.762
Made a friend there
already, huh, Joel?

14:06.763 --> 14:07.847
Gypsy, no.

14:07.848 --> 14:10.558
Check out this kid's glasses.
We're talking Coke bottles.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.184
Jesus.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.821
- What? All I said was...
- We heard you, man.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.283
Come on, Scratch. Let's do it.

14:27.284 --> 14:30.661
- What's your name?
- Billy. This is my dog Gypsy.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.705
Hey, Gypsy. How're you doing?

14:32.706 --> 14:34.799
Hey, Gypsy.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.668
Come on. I thought we were gonna
get everyone settled in first.

14:37.669 --> 14:42.339
Listen. If you want to stay here and play
with the vegetables, that's fine with me.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.841
I'm going.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.519
Fetch, boy. Go get it.

14:47.679 --> 14:53.776
- Come on, Gypsy. Come on. Come on.
- Yeah. Good dog. That a boy, Gypsy.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.715
Come on.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.460
Come on, Joe.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.211
- Come on, Jimmy Joe.
- Shut up.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.005
- You shut up.
- Stop it.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.090
You young ones just
stay put now, you hear?

15:25.091 --> 15:27.059
Yes, sir.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.735
- What's that?
- It's a camera, stupid.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.905
Yeah, it's my camera. See?

15:40.357 --> 15:43.117
Hey, can I take your picture?

15:44.736 --> 15:46.954
There you go.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.573
Good afternoon, Mr. Wallace.
What do you know today?

15:49.574 --> 15:50.991
No more than I did yesterday.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.711
Honey. Honey.

15:53.745 --> 15:57.673
- Do you have any beer, sir?
- No. No liquor.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.043
- Hessie, look.
- What?

16:01.044 --> 16:03.462
Jimmy Joe, you give that here.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.464
Jimmy Joe gots the ball
and won't give it up.

16:05.465 --> 16:09.226
Give it here. Give it.
Come on. Give it.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.234
Jimmy Joe, you done bad.

16:17.268 --> 16:20.312
Y'all know what settles
on bad ones, don't you?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.731
- Pumpkinhead.
- Pumpkinhead.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.359
Y'all stop.
There ain't no Pumpkinhead.

16:25.360 --> 16:29.071
- What about old Mr. Foley?
- He moved away.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.864
Uh-uh.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.366
Pumpkinhead got him.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.451
Teared off his head
and drank all the blood.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.078
- Did not.
- Did too.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.204
Shut up, Hessie!

16:37.205 --> 16:40.833
"Keep away from Pumpkinhead
Unless you're tired of living

16:40.834 --> 16:45.087
"His enemies are mostly dead
He's mean and unforgiving"

16:45.088 --> 16:47.056
Stop it!

16:53.304 --> 16:56.724
- Stop it!
- "Bolted doors and windows barred

16:56.725 --> 16:59.226
- "Guard dogs prowling in the yard"
- Pumpkinhead. Pumpkinhead.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.645
"Won't protect you till you're dead

17:01.646 --> 17:06.150
"Nothing will, from Pumpkinhead
So keep away from Pumpkinhead"

17:06.151 --> 17:08.536
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

17:10.905 --> 17:14.782
I mean, well,
you've got him pretty scared.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.502
- Pumpkinhead.
- All right.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.968
Get in the truck. Come on.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.346
Hey.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.108
Come on.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.661
Here you go, Billy.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.166
I was just about to
say something myself.

17:57.368 --> 18:00.037
- That'll do it for you, Mr. Wallace?
- That and my feed.

18:00.038 --> 18:02.915
Damn, I left it up at the house.
Give me a couple of minutes. Will you?

18:02.916 --> 18:05.084
I ain't got it. I'm due back now.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.586
Suppose I drop it off right at
your door? How'd that be?

18:07.587 --> 18:09.004
Be there before dark.

18:17.055 --> 18:20.432
Billy, bring Gypsy inside
out of the sun for a while.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.526
Yes, Daddy.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.481
- Got to admit, he's pretty good.
- He's a jerk.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.942
Yeah, but he's a talented jerk.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.319
Nah.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.371
He's just a jerk jerk.

18:36.825 --> 18:39.660
Billy, I want you to stay right
here and mind things, okay?

18:39.661 --> 18:41.537
I got to fetch something
up at the house.

18:41.538 --> 18:44.131
- Yes, sir, Daddy.
- Then we'll take us a little ride.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.335
Do you have to encourage him?

18:48.336 --> 18:52.222
Maggie, he's my brother.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.772
Be a good boy, now.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.158
- You man enough?
- Go for it!

19:40.430 --> 19:41.889
Gypsy, no.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.700
Little boy?

20:02.827 --> 20:04.661
- Are you okay?
- Little boy?

20:04.662 --> 20:06.463
What?

20:08.917 --> 20:10.801
Gypsy!

20:23.932 --> 20:25.733
No!

20:30.647 --> 20:32.064
Jesus.

20:38.947 --> 20:42.666
- Don't move him.
- He just came out of nowhere.

20:42.951 --> 20:45.836
- Is he all right?
- He's cold.

20:48.790 --> 20:51.550
It's gonna be okay, Billy.

20:53.127 --> 20:56.597
All right, keep him warm.
Keep him warm.

20:56.631 --> 20:59.341
- It's gonna be okay, little boy.
- Oh, God.

20:59.342 --> 21:03.136
- Hey! Stay here.
- We got to do something.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.814
You're gonna be fine.

21:10.061 --> 21:12.145
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

21:12.146 --> 21:14.648
We stay, I'm fucked, man.
Is that what you want?

21:14.649 --> 21:16.400
It was an accident.
I almost hit him myself.

21:16.401 --> 21:19.486
Yeah, but I've been drinking.
They'll fry me.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.612
You got to help me, Scratch.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.739
- Call an ambulance.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.625
Hurry!

21:26.286 --> 21:28.620
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Get in the car.

21:28.621 --> 21:32.508
- Get in the car. Get in the fucking car.
- No, we can't just leave him.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.970
Damn it.

21:42.552 --> 21:47.014
Joel, get back here!
Where the fuck is he going?

21:47.015 --> 21:50.901
- Forget Joel.
- Forget... Fuck.

21:51.644 --> 21:55.405
It'll be fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.150
- Come on.
- Chris, did you get through?

21:58.151 --> 22:00.736
- No phone.
- What about that guy at the stand?

22:00.737 --> 22:02.988
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone!

22:02.989 --> 22:07.200
Oh, God. Get to the cabin.
There's a phone over there.

22:07.201 --> 22:10.427
It's all right. Chris.
Take care of her...

22:10.428 --> 22:12.831
- and I'll stay with the kid.
- Yeah.

22:12.832 --> 22:16.793
Go help Chris with Maggie,
and I'll stay with the kid.

22:16.794 --> 22:20.430
- Are you sure?
- I'll stay with him. Go! Go!

22:21.466 --> 22:24.726
It's okay, Maggie. It's okay.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.527
Go.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.056
Billy?

23:10.681 --> 23:12.608
Billy?

23:13.101 --> 23:14.226
Gypsy.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.696
Billy.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.407
Gypsy.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.716
Billy. Billy, Daddy's here.

24:04.485 --> 24:06.620
It's okay.

24:18.249 --> 24:21.927
Nobody saw him. It was
an accident. Can I help?

24:58.915 --> 25:01.583
- Okay, Maggie, come on.
- Come on, Maggie.

25:01.584 --> 25:04.878
Maggie, come on. Listen. Just get up
to the cabin and get on that phone.

25:04.879 --> 25:05.962
I'm right behind you.

25:05.963 --> 25:09.975
- I just stay on this trail?
- Yes, stay on the trail.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.910
Did you call for help?

25:32.490 --> 25:35.042
Jesus. This is crazy.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.180
Damn you!

25:51.717 --> 25:53.843
Jesus, he just ripped the
phone cord out of the wall.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.220
What?

25:55.221 --> 25:57.138
I'm going back. I'm gonna
drive to the nearest town.

25:57.139 --> 25:59.224
You're not going anywhere.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.059
- Hey!
- Hey!

26:01.060 --> 26:02.769
What's up, man?

26:02.770 --> 26:04.479
Chris, please.

26:04.480 --> 26:08.316
Joel was in another accident a couple
of months ago and a girl was hurt.

26:08.317 --> 26:10.485
He's on probation right now.
If the police find out about it,

26:10.486 --> 26:13.488
- he could go to jail.
- They're not gonna find out about it.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.323
Look, man, I'm real sorry about that,

26:15.324 --> 26:19.252
but that little boy down
there needs our help now.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.880
Joel,

26:23.791 --> 26:26.835
just give me the keys, all right?

26:34.552 --> 26:36.928
- You okay?
- Yeah. Go.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.272
He wouldn't stop.

27:10.421 --> 27:14.724
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.965
Once upon a time,

27:47.875 --> 27:50.594
there was this old man,

27:52.755 --> 27:57.225
and he had a very, very special son.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.270
- Daddy.
- Yeah, baby?

28:50.980 --> 28:54.566
- Hey, are you okay?
- Steve! Steve!

28:54.567 --> 28:57.953
Hey, Steve, let us out, man!
We're in here!

28:59.864 --> 29:01.906
Oh, man. I just don't believe this.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.491
I'm not going to jail
for a fucking accident.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.285
- Come on, Steve! Damn it!
- Come on!

29:05.286 --> 29:08.204
Just look, the kid's father showed up.
He took the kid away.

29:08.205 --> 29:09.789
Now, I think everything's
gonna be okay.

29:09.790 --> 29:10.957
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:10.958 --> 29:13.918
- Did you tell him what happened?
- I told him it was an accident.

29:13.919 --> 29:17.213
- And?
- And he just looked at me.

29:17.214 --> 29:20.383
- What do you mean, he just looked at you?
- I don't know.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.594
Don't lie to me!

29:22.595 --> 29:25.397
He looked at me like
he wanted to kill me.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.483
Looking for your pa.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.109
- Hey! Bunt!
- Sir?

30:20.110 --> 30:23.079
- Fetch your grandpa.
- Okay.

30:28.452 --> 30:31.746
Grandpa, Pa wants you.
Mr. Harley's outside with the feed.

30:31.747 --> 30:35.550
You go on out and unload
the feed. I'll be out directly.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.392
- Here's what I owe you.
- Keep it if you can help me.

30:52.393 --> 30:55.320
I'm looking for an old woman.

30:55.354 --> 30:58.857
She lives somewhere in
the mountains hereabouts.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.484
Some folkses say as
how she's got powers.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.903
I never heared of no such woman.

31:03.904 --> 31:06.990
Mr. Wallace. Please.

31:06.991 --> 31:10.293
I can't tell you what I don't know.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.341
- Bunt.
- Sir?

31:25.342 --> 31:27.886
- Get over by the house.
- But you told me to do this first.

31:27.887 --> 31:30.597
You do what I told you,
boy, and you do it now.

31:30.598 --> 31:32.440
Okay.

31:36.353 --> 31:40.156
- What killed him?
- City folks run him over.

31:42.526 --> 31:45.278
- Left him.
- I'm sorry about your boy.

31:45.279 --> 31:48.197
You got to tell me. She's the
only one that can help him.

31:48.198 --> 31:52.785
- Like I said, I'm sorry.
- You got to tell me, God damn it!

31:52.786 --> 31:57.582
She can't help him. All she can
do is take you straight to hell.

31:57.583 --> 32:03.054
Now, you go on home. You go
home and you bury your boy.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.272
Hold it!

32:20.648 --> 32:25.869
Mr. Harley, I heard you
talking to my grandpa.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.997
I know who you're looking for.

32:29.531 --> 32:32.492
- What's your trade?
- What?

32:32.493 --> 32:34.919
Her name's Haggis.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.963
She's up on Black Ridge.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.631
Get in back.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.600
No way.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.762
You got to show me. Get in back.

32:52.763 --> 32:55.982
Okay, but I'm only going part way.

32:58.769 --> 33:01.696
That old woman scares
the piss out of me.

33:04.441 --> 33:08.411
Stop it! Stop the truck! Stop!

33:11.115 --> 33:14.951
This is as far as I go.
You keep on straight.

33:14.952 --> 33:17.161
Follow this road till
you can't no more.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.215
You come to a cabin, that's her.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.069
Who are you?

35:07.147 --> 35:08.981
Ed Harley. I thought...

35:08.982 --> 35:14.120
Afraid raising the dead
ain't within my power.

35:49.898 --> 35:52.033
This is...

35:53.318 --> 35:56.746
This is all I got.
This is everything.

36:02.870 --> 36:05.630
Nothing I can do for him.

36:05.664 --> 36:10.001
- When I was young...
- I said, there's nothing I can do.

36:10.002 --> 36:12.804
- I saw it.
- What?

36:14.756 --> 36:17.976
What do you want, Ed Harley?

36:18.135 --> 36:20.144
Say it.

36:22.806 --> 36:27.026
Say it! Say it!

36:30.230 --> 36:33.691
When I was young,
folks used to talk about you.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.693
Said as how you knew things.

36:35.694 --> 36:39.864
Said if a man had been wronged,
he could come to you

36:39.865 --> 36:43.743
and you'd called upon this
thing in that man's name,

36:43.744 --> 36:46.245
and that man, he'd be avenged.

36:46.246 --> 36:48.798
What you're asking

36:49.124 --> 36:52.969
got a powerful price.

36:53.754 --> 36:56.047
They killed my boy.

36:56.048 --> 36:59.809
They run him over and they left him.

37:03.472 --> 37:07.525
Ever hear of Razorback Hollow?

37:09.603 --> 37:12.146
There's an old graveyard

37:12.147 --> 37:15.283
way back deep in them woods.

37:16.068 --> 37:21.205
Mountain folk used to bury kin
in there, kin they's ashamed of.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.450
Bring a shovel.

37:24.451 --> 37:28.046
The thing you're
looking for is in there.

37:29.456 --> 37:31.457
Bring it back here.

37:31.458 --> 37:36.763
Some things I got to do to it
before it'll be any use to you.

37:37.214 --> 37:41.434
- That graveyard... How will I know...
- You'll know, Ed Harley.

37:42.636 --> 37:44.812
You'll know.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.029
Leave the boy.

40:16.623 --> 40:18.424
God.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.854
When we get out of here,

41:21.855 --> 41:25.566
Joel's gonna be carrying his
balls home in a knapsack.

41:25.567 --> 41:28.652
Remind me never to
piss you off, Tracy.

41:28.653 --> 41:31.071
I'll tell them it was my fault,

41:31.072 --> 41:34.250
that it was my bike that hit him.

41:34.784 --> 41:39.005
The worst they're gonna give
me is a slap on the wrist.

41:39.247 --> 41:41.048
No.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.727
Look, I'm really starting
to worry about Maggie.

42:04.898 --> 42:07.199
Bring it here.

42:24.751 --> 42:29.972
- What is it?
- It's what you wanted, Ed Harley.

42:31.508 --> 42:38.472
For each of man's evils,
a special demon exists.

42:38.473 --> 42:41.016
You're looking at vengeance,

42:41.017 --> 42:47.323
cruel, devious,
pure-as-venom vengeance.

42:49.150 --> 42:51.619
Give me your hand.

45:17.841 --> 45:21.143
You can go now, Ed Harley.

45:22.470 --> 45:24.772
Now it begins.

45:51.666 --> 45:54.260
What'd you do, Daddy?

46:28.745 --> 46:33.549
Well, fuck it. Let's just kidnap
Chris and Tracy and go to Mexico.

46:35.668 --> 46:37.553
Guys.

46:39.756 --> 46:44.101
You got to do the right thing,
and you got to do it now.

46:50.350 --> 46:54.570
They killed our boy, Lynn, honey.
Now they're gonna pay.

47:19.045 --> 47:21.013
Maggie.

47:24.092 --> 47:27.019
Here. Look.

47:27.136 --> 47:29.221
Look, Maggie. Look at it.

47:29.222 --> 47:32.182
You always found your
strength from this.

47:32.183 --> 47:34.810
Well, find it now and come back.

47:34.811 --> 47:36.937
I need you.

47:36.938 --> 47:40.065
Steve. Steve.

47:40.066 --> 47:41.950
Yeah.

47:47.824 --> 47:50.751
It's okay. I'm sure the
boy's gonna be fine.

47:51.911 --> 47:54.004
I'm sure his father's
taking care of everything.

47:57.500 --> 48:01.887
Steve! No!

48:20.899 --> 48:25.536
Help! Steve! No!

48:35.538 --> 48:38.173
I'm always fucking up.

48:39.626 --> 48:42.720
My whole life, one big fuck-up.

48:43.296 --> 48:45.723
But it stops now.

48:59.812 --> 49:02.940
- Help me! Help me!
- Maggie!

49:02.941 --> 49:05.659
- Maggie, what happened?
- It's killing him!

49:10.156 --> 49:12.416
Lock the door.

49:15.370 --> 49:17.296
Steve!

49:18.706 --> 49:23.251
If those scum hurt my brother,
I'll rip their fucking hearts out. Steve!

49:23.252 --> 49:25.337
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...

49:25.338 --> 49:28.173
Maggie, whatever you saw
out there, it wasn't the devil.

49:28.174 --> 49:29.424
It was!

49:29.425 --> 49:32.728
- There is no such thing.
- There is! I saw it!

49:33.930 --> 49:37.983
Oh, man, be okay, Steve. Be okay.
We're gonna find him, man.

50:05.378 --> 50:09.339
They should be okay, right? I mean,
they took the gun and everything.

50:09.340 --> 50:13.685
God is the only thing that can
stop what's out there, Kim.

50:26.941 --> 50:29.535
Just in case God doesn't show.

50:40.246 --> 50:42.381
Oh, God, Steve.

50:43.291 --> 50:45.843
Cabin, man! Come on!

50:56.429 --> 50:58.397
Jesus.

50:58.848 --> 51:00.474
- Joel!
- You all right?

51:00.475 --> 51:02.434
- There was something at the window.
- What about Steve?

51:02.435 --> 51:03.602
We couldn't find him.

51:03.603 --> 51:05.479
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

51:05.480 --> 51:07.105
We've got to get
the hell out of here.

51:07.106 --> 51:09.357
We're not going
anywhere without Steve.

51:09.358 --> 51:12.402
- Maggie, we don't know what's out there.
- Steve is out there.

51:12.403 --> 51:14.488
She's right. Now, come on.
We're gonna find him.

51:14.489 --> 51:16.498
Maggie, wait!

51:32.173 --> 51:35.893
- Here, help me!
- Maggie!

51:40.098 --> 51:42.065
Tracy!

51:42.850 --> 51:47.145
- Maggie! Maggie!
- God damn it! Tracy! Wait!

52:17.677 --> 52:21.388
- Maggie! Maggie!
- Did you see something?

52:21.389 --> 52:25.150
- I saw something. I don't know what...
- Just stay close, okay?

53:13.524 --> 53:16.159
It'll pass, Ed Harley.

53:16.736 --> 53:20.822
- Let it finish.
- No, you got to stop it.

53:20.823 --> 53:23.158
It's what you wanted.

53:23.159 --> 53:26.953
No! Not like this! Not like this!

53:26.954 --> 53:30.090
I see it. This is wrong.

53:30.208 --> 53:32.542
Nothing I can do.

53:32.543 --> 53:35.637
It's got to run its course now.

53:35.713 --> 53:39.341
What did you think? It'd be easy,

53:39.342 --> 53:42.552
neat and clean and painless?

53:42.553 --> 53:45.555
- You're a fool.
- If you won't help me...

53:45.556 --> 53:48.183
If you don't help me,
then I'll do it myself.

53:48.184 --> 53:50.602
I'll do it, I'll do it myself.

53:50.603 --> 53:56.024
You'll fail, Ed Harley.
You'll fail and you'll die, too.

53:56.025 --> 53:58.318
Then I'll die. Then I'll die!

53:58.319 --> 54:02.906
And pay the final
price all the sooner.

54:02.907 --> 54:05.533
God damn you. God damn you.

54:05.534 --> 54:09.171
He already has, son.

54:10.498 --> 54:13.383
He already has.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.888
Maggie!

54:48.369 --> 54:52.255
No! No!

55:30.328 --> 55:32.921
I'm the one you want!

56:11.994 --> 56:14.337
No!

56:20.544 --> 56:22.962
No!

56:22.963 --> 56:24.806
No!

56:26.467 --> 56:29.886
- Oh, my God, Joel. What's wrong?
- It's got Kim.

56:29.887 --> 56:31.638
- What's got her?
- It's a thing.

56:31.639 --> 56:34.274
- What thing, man?
- It's a thing! I don't know! It's a thing!

56:37.686 --> 56:40.855
- Kim! Kim! Kim!
- Come on, man. Come on, man.

56:40.856 --> 56:43.116
Tracy, come on!

56:43.609 --> 56:46.286
Kim! Kim!

56:47.696 --> 56:51.416
- Joel!
- Oh, my God.

56:51.742 --> 56:53.410
Kim!

56:58.457 --> 57:01.251
- No.
- No!

57:03.754 --> 57:05.555
No!

57:11.053 --> 57:13.847
Joel, come on. We got to move, man.

57:13.848 --> 57:15.857
Come on!

58:41.352 --> 58:43.361
Help us!

58:44.021 --> 58:46.814
- Hello?
- Why is this happening?

58:46.815 --> 58:51.119
- I don't know!
- We got to move. Let's go.

58:53.614 --> 58:56.741
- Help! Somebody help us!
- Help!

58:56.742 --> 58:58.618
Help us!

58:58.619 --> 59:02.413
Anybody in there, please?
There's something after us.

59:02.414 --> 59:04.341
Please!

59:05.417 --> 59:07.585
Where's Steve at?

59:07.586 --> 59:09.128
Please!

59:09.129 --> 59:11.348
Don't be mad.

59:12.132 --> 59:14.642
- I'm cold.
- Come on.

59:16.178 --> 59:18.229
Steve's dead.

59:20.975 --> 59:22.976
Come on, man.

59:22.977 --> 59:24.769
Come on.

59:24.770 --> 59:26.780
Come on.

59:33.070 --> 59:35.038
Tracy.

59:43.706 --> 59:46.374
Shit. It's locked.

59:46.375 --> 59:49.552
Okay, just get back.

59:54.008 --> 59:56.643
Empty your hands, son.

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:03.608
Get away from here.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:06.403
- Go on. Get.
- Look, mister.

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:12.450
We got something chasing us.
We just want to use your truck, okay?

01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:15.870
- Please.
- Get off my land.

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:18.531
Don't make me have to shoot you.

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:22.994
- Please. We just need your help.
- I can't help you.

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:25.163
You folks is marked.

01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:28.258
Marked? What do you mean, marked?

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:11.759
Joel. Joel, no. No, Joel,
you don't know if it's dead!

01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:20.977
It's dead.

01:01:42.074 --> 01:01:43.958
Joel!

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:23.573
Come on.

01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:24.782
- Come on.
- What is it?

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:28.411
I don't know! But whatever it is, it's
not gonna get us. Do you hear me?

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:33.174
It's not gonna get us! There must
be somebody that can help us!

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:35.718
Come on!

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:54.070
Bunt, get away from that window.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:57.356
Grandpa, you sure that thing
ain't gonna hurt the animals?

01:02:57.357 --> 01:03:00.276
It only kills what it was
called upon to kill.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:03.029
Them, and whatever gets in its way.

01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:04.781
Our animals will be fine.

01:03:04.782 --> 01:03:08.751
You get away from that
window, and you get to bed.

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:13.915
Help! Help us!

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:16.926
Get to bed like I told you. Now.

01:03:17.628 --> 01:03:19.712
For God's sake, please.

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:23.057
Help us! Come on, man! Let us in.

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:30.648
Damn.

01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:02.213
- Bunt?
- Go back to sleep, Hessie.

01:04:02.214 --> 01:04:04.974
- What you doing?
- Nothing.

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:13.441
Okay.

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:18.646
If I tell you, you got to promise
not to tell nobody. Not a soul.

01:04:18.647 --> 01:04:21.491
- I won't.
- Cross your heart.

01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:24.861
- Now swear.
- I swear.

01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:26.704
Spit.

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:33.995
I'm gonna help those folks, Hessie. I got
to find out if it's real or just a story.

01:04:33.996 --> 01:04:35.955
Grandpa will whip you
good if he finds out.

01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:38.758
He ain't gonna find out.

01:04:41.587 --> 01:04:43.680
Be careful.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.850
Of course I'm gonna be careful.

01:05:06.028 --> 01:05:07.829
Hey.

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:12.867
Shh.

01:05:12.868 --> 01:05:14.794
Come on.

01:05:19.124 --> 01:05:21.459
- It's you.
- Did you get a look at it?

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.711
- What's it look like? Is it big?
- Who are you?

01:05:23.712 --> 01:05:28.558
- Man, what's going on?
- I'm trying to help you, for Christ's sake.

01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:31.761
My name's Bunt. I live
in this house here.

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:34.430
How come nobody answered
the door? Didn't they hear us?

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:37.767
They can hear you.
They ain't allowed to help.

01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:39.977
They ain't allowed to let you in.
They can't get involved.

01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:43.147
- What do you mean, man?
- A man back there said we were marked.

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:47.902
We can't talk about this here. Come on.
I know a place that might be safe.

01:05:47.903 --> 01:05:49.779
Come on.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:55.251
I know where we can go.
Come on. Come on.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:43.758
Ain't it neat?

01:06:44.251 --> 01:06:48.921
About 40 years ago, they tried to
start a congregation up around here.

01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:51.716
Didn't work out, I guess.

01:06:51.717 --> 01:06:55.177
I figure it's a holy place,
so it might not like it here.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:57.146
Come on.

01:06:57.973 --> 01:07:00.483
Come on. Watch out.

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:17.166
Bunt. What do you know about
that thing that's after us?

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:20.336
It's some kind of demon.

01:07:22.414 --> 01:07:23.539
Before tonight I didn't believe it.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:28.627
I thought it was just something that
they made up to scare the little kids.

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:33.132
But when the sun went down, my grandpa
fetched the whole family together.

01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:36.302
And he told us that some outsider
folks had done something real bad.

01:07:36.303 --> 01:07:39.522
He wouldn't say what. He just said

01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:43.100
that Pumpkinhead was
gonna be out after them,

01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:45.144
and that we better stay
inside till he got them.

01:07:45.145 --> 01:07:48.531
- Pumpkinhead?
- That's what it's called,

01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:51.567
'cause it comes from the old
pumpkin patch graveyard.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:55.196
- Well, do you know why it's after us?
- No, ma'am.

01:07:55.197 --> 01:07:57.531
But you must have done something bad.

01:07:57.532 --> 01:08:00.868
See, according to the legend, if one
man does something bad to another man,

01:08:00.869 --> 01:08:04.497
it's got to be something real bad,
something like killing...

01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:09.010
Then that other man can have Pumpkinhead
conjured up to take revenge.

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:13.089
The kid at the stand.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:16.850
What? What?

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:20.520
There was an accident earlier.

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:25.818
One of our friends hit a
little boy with a motorcycle.

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:28.020
Where?

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:32.073
At the fruit stand a couple
of miles down the road.

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:34.359
Gosh almighty. Billy Harley.

01:08:34.361 --> 01:08:37.330
You know? You heard about it?

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:42.952
I took his...

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:48.591
I saw his pa, Mr. Harley, this afternoon.
I took him somewhere.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:52.094
- Well, was his son okay?
- I can't say for sure.

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:55.548
But if that thing's hunting you,
I suppose not.

01:08:55.549 --> 01:08:57.299
Oh, my God.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:01.228
- Your friends, where are they now?
- They're dead.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.685
Do you know the spot
on Bradley Mountain

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:09.603
- where people park their cars?
- Yes.

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:12.198
- Can you take us there?
- Uh-huh.

01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:16.535
I think it's here now.

01:09:37.174 --> 01:09:38.924
Go!

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:41.102
Go! Move it!

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:43.122
Wallace! Wallace! Open up!

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:48.753
Wallace, open up! Wallace!

01:10:48.787 --> 01:10:51.121
We got to stop it!

01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:55.051
We got to stop it, or it's
going to kill them all.

01:10:55.794 --> 01:10:59.129
Open up or I'll blow the
goddamn thing off the hinges.

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:01.432
Lose it, Harley.

01:11:07.389 --> 01:11:11.609
You get away from here.
Get away from me and my kin.

01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:29.960
This way.

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:43.465
Stay here.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.768
- No.
- Stay here.

01:12:11.703 --> 01:12:13.629
Chris!

01:12:30.472 --> 01:12:32.481
Chris.

01:12:39.314 --> 01:12:41.240
Chris.

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:44.201
Come on. Please.

01:12:46.071 --> 01:12:47.830
Come on.

01:12:54.788 --> 01:12:57.331
Ma'am, you got to get up.
Come on. We got to go.

01:12:57.332 --> 01:13:00.459
Please. We can't stop it. No one can.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.636
Somebody can.

01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:06.757
- Mr. Harley.
- Come with me.

01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:08.926
Mr. Harley,
it's Pumpkinhead. It's real.

01:13:08.927 --> 01:13:10.686
Now.

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:13.856
Come on.

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:23.949
Get in.

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:56.857
Get in the house.

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:58.817
Do you wanna live?

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:23.333
You Okay?

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:25.177
Yeah.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:29.431
Thanks to you.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:36.605
I'm gonna go outside
and talk to Mr. Harley.

01:14:37.265 --> 01:14:39.984
I want you to stay here.

01:14:41.019 --> 01:14:42.778
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:18.223 --> 01:15:20.482
Mr. Harley?

01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:23.527
Mr. Harley.

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:27.740
It was an accident.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:32.286
He's dead.

01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:36.790
Nobody saw him until it was too late.

01:15:46.668 --> 01:15:51.305
Can't you stop this?
Can't you call it off?

01:15:52.799 --> 01:15:55.517
Nothing can call it off.

01:15:57.387 --> 01:16:01.732
But I'm gonna send it back to
whatever hell it come from.

01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:33.013
You old dog.

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:52.825
Mr. Harley?

01:17:24.182 --> 01:17:26.516
Mr. Harley, are you okay?

01:18:14.482 --> 01:18:16.408
Chris.

01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:42.137
Kill me.

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:49.410
