00:02.564 --> 00:05.397
<i>It all started when a time-travel
experiment I was conducting... </i>

00:05.467 --> 00:08.402
<i>went... a little caca. </i>

00:08.470 --> 00:11.962
<i>In the blink of a cosmic clock,</i>
<i>I went from quantum physicist... </i>

00:12.040 --> 00:15.407
<i>... to air force test pilot,</i>

00:15.477 --> 00:18.878
<i>which could have been fun</i>
<i>if I knew how to fly. </i>

00:18.947 --> 00:22.644
<i>Fortunately, I had help... </i>
<i>an observer from the project named Al. </i>

00:22.718 --> 00:27.155
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram,</i>
<i>so all he can lend is moral support. </i>

00:27.222 --> 00:30.214
<i>Anyway, here I am,</i>
<i>bouncing around in time,</i>

00:30.292 --> 00:32.226
<i>putting things right</i>
<i>that once went wrong... </i>

00:32.293 --> 00:36.321
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone Ranger</i>
<i>with Al as my Tonto,</i>

00:36.398 --> 00:39.333
<i>and I don't even need a mask. </i>

00:40.335 --> 00:41.859
Oh, boy.

01:57.379 --> 01:59.847
<i>Bouncing around in time</i>
<i>can be a little disorienting,</i>

01:59.915 --> 02:02.941
<i>a little taxing on the nerves,</i>

02:03.018 --> 02:06.419
<i>a little jolting to the... equilibrium. </i>

02:07.556 --> 02:10.354
<i>It can also be very rewarding. </i>

02:10.425 --> 02:12.985
<i>Unfortunately, like the Bible says,</i>

02:13.061 --> 02:15.052
<i>the Lord giveth... </i>

02:18.567 --> 02:20.797
<i>And the Lord taketh away. </i>

02:34.850 --> 02:37.785
Not gonna do it.
I want heirs, Tess.

02:37.853 --> 02:41.687
I want Riata to stay in the family,
to go to my grandsons.

02:41.756 --> 02:45.920
Well, I don't see that happening, Chance.
So if you're so damn set on disinheriting me...

02:45.994 --> 02:48.827
if I don't lift up my tail
and act like a brood mare,

02:48.897 --> 02:53.027
then maybe you should figure out some way to
take the spread with you when the time comes.

02:53.101 --> 02:56.669
It's all my fault. I raised you
to run this place like a man,

02:56.670 --> 02:58.971
and now you don't
know how to be a woman.

02:59.040 --> 03:02.806
That's just fine with me. I never
did take to sashayin' and swoonin'.

03:02.878 --> 03:06.678
Well, your mama, God rest her soul, she'd
have made a woman of you instead of a cowboy.

03:06.748 --> 03:09.216
Why can't I be both?
'Cause it ain't natural.

03:09.284 --> 03:12.481
Get married, Tess.
Who do you expect me to marry?

03:12.554 --> 03:14.818
Ben or Eddie...

03:14.890 --> 03:17.256
or Zeke?

03:19.060 --> 03:22.052
I won't breed with inferior stock,
Chance.

03:22.130 --> 03:24.564
The man I marry has to be
more of a man than I am.

03:24.633 --> 03:27.602
Now, daughter, I'm here to tell you.
I don't want to hurt your feelings,

03:27.669 --> 03:31.036
but any man on this ranch
is more man than you are.

03:31.106 --> 03:35.543
Bull. Nobody here can keep
up with me, including Wayne.

03:35.610 --> 03:38.511
Aw, now you're talkin'
like a fool, girl.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.525
And I'll tell you what. If
there's a man on this ranch

03:40.526 --> 03:42.949
who can keep up with me for
one week, then I'll marry him.

03:43.018 --> 03:46.920
But if he can't, then we forget about
this marriage business once and for all.

03:46.988 --> 03:49.889
Honey, you just overplayed your hand.
I pick.

03:49.958 --> 03:53.359
No. I pick him.

03:53.428 --> 03:55.191
I pick...

04:01.970 --> 04:04.097
Him.

04:04.172 --> 04:06.970
Tess, you can't be serious.

04:07.042 --> 04:10.136
You said any man on the ranch,
Chance, and a deal's a deal.

04:10.211 --> 04:13.078
Right, Doc? Right.

04:13.148 --> 04:16.276
- You go for it, Doc?
- Go for what?

04:16.351 --> 04:20.720
Marriage, son.
To Tess and 50,000 acres of Riata.

04:20.789 --> 04:24.885
If you can outride,
out rope and all-around out cowboy me.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.418
- You're kiddin', right?
- This is Texas, son.

04:28.496 --> 04:32.933
We don't kid about our land,
our women or our livestock.

04:33.001 --> 04:37.768
- Now, what's the matter with that little pig?
- Uh... Wha...

04:37.839 --> 04:43.778
- It's hog cholera, ain't it?
- Hog cholera, uh...

04:43.845 --> 04:47.008
Well, you... you never know with pigs.

04:47.082 --> 04:52.645
Damn, I was afraid of that. We're gonna
have to shoot the whole mess of'em.

04:52.721 --> 04:54.985
- Shoot 'em?
- Then burn 'em.

04:57.192 --> 04:59.285
No, no, no, no, no. You can't...
You can't shoot 'em,

04:59.361 --> 05:04.458
because I, uh, haven't made
a... a diagnosis yet.

05:04.532 --> 05:06.864
Uh, okay?

05:14.442 --> 05:16.876
Well, what do ya say?

05:16.945 --> 05:21.143
I'll take the pig.
You keep the daughter.

05:30.792 --> 05:34.455
Well, pick another one.
Nope. It's Doc or nothin'.

05:34.529 --> 05:37.657
Come on, Tess.
Or nothin', Chance.

05:42.537 --> 05:44.528
Doc's a fool.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.716
<i>Thad and me... </i>

05:55.784 --> 05:58.753
<i>... thad and me</i>

05:58.820 --> 06:04.690
<i>All he does is chew and chew</i>

06:08.229 --> 06:13.561
<i>Thad and me</i>

06:13.635 --> 06:17.196
<i>All he does is</i>

06:17.272 --> 06:19.604
<i>Baa at me</i>

06:26.715 --> 06:27.688
<i>Every time I leap,</i>

06:27.689 --> 06:32.312
<i>I do this song and dance to find </i>
<i>out who I am and where I live. </i>

06:32.387 --> 06:36.346
<i>Sometimes... it's hard,</i>

06:36.424 --> 06:39.359
<i>and sometimes it's easy. </i>

06:39.427 --> 06:44.990
<i>All he does is baa at me</i>

06:48.036 --> 06:52.084
<i>Figuring out the names of everyone I'm
supposed to know is a little tougher,</i>

06:52.085 --> 06:53.770
<i>especially if they're alone. </i>

06:53.842 --> 06:57.938
- Hey, Doc.
- Hi, uh, pard.

06:58.012 --> 07:01.243
What happened to you?

07:01.316 --> 07:03.614
Oh, just had a little accident.

07:03.685 --> 07:06.483
Looks like you got us
another patient there.

07:06.554 --> 07:09.112
Yeah, gotta figure out what's
causin' this little guy's runny nose.

07:09.113 --> 07:10.354
Think it might be the hog cholera?

07:10.425 --> 07:12.950
No, it's not hog chol... cholera.

07:13.027 --> 07:15.018
Whatever you say, Doc.

07:15.096 --> 07:19.897
Listen, I fed and watered all the
animals and, uh, cleaned out the cages.

07:19.968 --> 07:23.597
Thanks, uh, pard.

07:23.671 --> 07:28.005
See ya tomorrow, Doc.
Come on, Pard. Let's go.

07:33.882 --> 07:36.442
Couldn't you give 'em name tags?

07:36.518 --> 07:38.509
Or tattoos.

07:42.323 --> 07:45.952
Tina's got her name in a tattoo.

07:46.027 --> 07:48.860
Course, that wouldn't do you much good,
because it's...

07:48.930 --> 07:52.093
It's in a super private part
of her anatomy.

07:53.535 --> 07:58.802
Of course, she always thought
you were kind of cute.

07:58.873 --> 08:04.175
Uh, Sam, you've never seen
Tina's tattoo, have you?

08:19.060 --> 08:22.052
- You didn't answer my question, Sam.
- What?

08:22.130 --> 08:27.796
- Did you ever see Tina's tattoo?
- Are you serious?

08:27.869 --> 08:30.463
You've seen it.

08:31.873 --> 08:36.741
Al, I don't even remember Tina,
let alone her tattoo.

08:36.811 --> 08:41.373
- You're hiding behind your Swiss cheese brain.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

08:41.448 --> 08:46.011
Nah, it couldn't be you.
You're stuck here in 1956.

08:46.087 --> 08:49.398
56's? I'm still a baby. My
sister Kate's not even born yet.

08:49.399 --> 08:50.888
Who's President, Eisenhower?

08:50.959 --> 08:54.190
- Ike Bentenhoff.
- What?

08:54.262 --> 08:55.696
He works in Imaging Control.

08:55.697 --> 08:59.996
At the Christmas party, when Lucille and
I slipped off into the energizing chamber...

09:00.068 --> 09:02.332
- to... to...
- I know, I know.

09:02.403 --> 09:08.273
Exchange gifts, that dirty dog took
advantage of my absence to cozy up to Tina.

09:08.343 --> 09:12.746
- Tina's cheating on you?
- Can you believe it?

09:12.814 --> 09:15.112
It boggles the mind.

09:19.787 --> 09:21.982
Come in here, Al.

09:23.758 --> 09:26.158
It's like Noah's Ark.

09:26.227 --> 09:28.559
Well, this is kinda fun.

09:30.565 --> 09:33.864
Oh, listen, Al. You figure out
what I'm here to do?

09:33.935 --> 09:37.496
Oh, uh, no, I haven't finished
the computation yet.

09:37.572 --> 09:39.563
Uh, just a second.

09:40.742 --> 09:42.903
Uh, well, according to Ziggy,

09:42.977 --> 09:48.074
there's a 72% chance
you're here to cure the pig.

09:48.149 --> 09:53.246
For a minute I thought I was
here to marry Tess. Huh! Oh.

09:53.321 --> 09:57.121
"Oh," what? Oh, oh, well, I haven't
run a number on that yet. Wait.

09:58.993 --> 10:01.154
Oh, it's not so bad, Sam.

10:01.229 --> 10:05.256
Uh, there's only a 47% chance
you're gonna marry this girl Tess.

10:05.333 --> 10:09.463
- Hey, Al, do pigs like milk?
- Oh, they adore it.

10:09.537 --> 10:12.995
Do you know what's wrong with this...
with him?

10:13.074 --> 10:16.339
Uh, it's not a him, Sam. It's a girl.

10:16.411 --> 10:19.039
Trust me, Sam.

10:22.216 --> 10:26.277
Runny nose, watery eyes...

10:26.354 --> 10:30.518
Squeaky voice... loud squeaky voice.

10:32.927 --> 10:35.088
I don't know, Al. I don't know...

10:35.163 --> 10:39.031
Al. Al, that raccoon can see you.

10:39.100 --> 10:42.331
Oh, well, almost all animals can see me.

10:42.403 --> 10:44.746
But, you know, there must be
somethin' weird lookin' about me,

10:44.747 --> 10:46.430
because I seem to intimidate them.

10:46.507 --> 10:48.771
Maybe it's your clothes.

10:51.746 --> 10:56.046
Hey, Al.
Here's a scrapbook on Tess McGill.

10:58.386 --> 11:01.878
- Look at this.
- What?

11:01.956 --> 11:04.720
Well, it-it's Doc's diary.

11:04.792 --> 11:08.193
Correction, it's your diary.

11:08.262 --> 11:11.026
Well, technically it is, but,

11:11.099 --> 11:14.193
I mean, you know,
in reality it's...

11:14.268 --> 11:17.999
Just go ahead
and read the diary, Sam.

11:20.375 --> 11:24.573
"I saw her today. She was having trouble
getting her prize stallion to mate.

11:24.645 --> 11:27.170
That's a cross we all have to bear...

11:27.248 --> 11:30.945
performance under pressure.

11:31.019 --> 11:34.318
"I wanted to take her in my arms,
to kiss her cheeks, her eyes, her lips,

11:34.389 --> 11:37.085
"but after all these years,
I'm still dumbstruck in her presence.

11:37.158 --> 11:41.151
Will I ever have the courage
to tell Tess how much I love her?"

11:41.229 --> 11:44.062
Al, Doc's in love with Tess.

11:44.132 --> 11:46.396
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh," what?

11:46.467 --> 11:50.062
Well, uh, there's a 97% probability...

11:50.138 --> 11:54.006
that someone who's been sending
her love letters will marry Tess.

11:54.075 --> 11:59.012
Well, uh, then I'm okay, because this is a diary.
It's not love letters.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.311
Don't fight it, Sam.
You're here to marry this cowboy.

12:02.383 --> 12:06.012
Uh, boy-girl. Cowgirl. Girl.

12:15.596 --> 12:17.587
Tess, look here.

12:23.871 --> 12:25.805
Mornin', Doc.

12:25.873 --> 12:27.864
Chance.

12:29.210 --> 12:31.542
Does your bein' here
mean we got to shoot 'em?

12:31.612 --> 12:33.603
Shoot 'em?

12:33.681 --> 12:36.582
Oh, uh, no, no. Uh, I haven't
figured out what's wrong with Piggy,

12:36.651 --> 12:38.585
but it's not hog cholera.
Piggy?

12:38.653 --> 12:42.987
That's what I-I... named the little pig.

12:43.057 --> 12:45.048
Piggy.

12:45.126 --> 12:47.788
Then you're here
to take me on, Doc?

12:47.862 --> 12:52.322
That's right, Tess.
I'm here to take you on.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.631
Yahoo, boys!
We got us a contest!

12:59.674 --> 13:02.142
Get you in shape.

13:02.210 --> 13:04.940
Come on. Take this, would ya?
Take this thing.

13:05.012 --> 13:07.173
Easy.

13:07.248 --> 13:09.409
Here, Doc. You don't have to do that. Oh.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.475
Take that one.
Thanks.

13:20.628 --> 13:23.119
First thing my Dad taught me
about mounting an unknown horse...

13:23.197 --> 13:27.861
was to look him straight in the eye
and show him who's boss.

13:27.935 --> 13:31.462
Then, with a good grip on the reins,

13:31.539 --> 13:34.167
mount quickly and take a firm seat.

13:34.242 --> 13:37.143
After that, the rest was easy.

13:47.421 --> 13:49.787
Uuh!

13:55.263 --> 14:00.030
<i>Hey, Doc! Got a bottle of liniment for
you right here! Get up there!</i>

14:01.135 --> 14:03.330
What the hell's got into you, Doc?

14:03.404 --> 14:07.238
All of Texas knows nobody's ever
ridden Widowmaker, except me.

14:11.879 --> 14:13.870
Ooh!

14:17.451 --> 14:20.352
Hope you don't mind, Doc.

14:24.625 --> 14:27.116
Just a little cowboy humor.

14:27.195 --> 14:30.392
Well, I...
I always liked a good joke.

14:59.794 --> 15:03.161
Ever do any ropin', Doc?

15:03.231 --> 15:05.495
Well, it's been a while.

15:05.566 --> 15:08.034
You, uh, knot your rope to the horn,
or you dally it?

15:08.102 --> 15:11.538
- Dally?
- From the Mex... dale vuelta.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.597
It means to give it a turn.

15:13.674 --> 15:16.268
See, you just take the rope
in your hand like this,

15:16.344 --> 15:19.507
give it a turn
around the horn for leverage.

15:19.580 --> 15:22.913
Easier to release.

15:22.984 --> 15:25.919
It's your turn, Doc. You up to it?

15:25.987 --> 15:29.514
Dale... Vuelta.

15:29.590 --> 15:32.491
- Dale vuelta.
- Yeah. Go get 'em.

15:34.996 --> 15:36.395
Yah!

15:44.905 --> 15:47.567
What were you two palaverin' about?

15:47.642 --> 15:51.134
Oh, I was just, uh,
showin' him how to dally his rope.

16:10.898 --> 16:14.834
You tell him to keep his thumb up?

16:14.902 --> 16:17.996
Wayne, if he's not careful
that rope will jerk his thumb off.

16:18.072 --> 16:20.438
You wanna win this contest or not?

16:21.842 --> 16:25.300
Now, I'm tellin' you somethin'.
The main mistake you're makin' is...

16:25.379 --> 16:27.847
pick one and stay on him, patient.

16:27.915 --> 16:32.011
Even if another one is closer,
don't go after this'un and after that'un.

16:32.086 --> 16:36.682
Pick one and stay with that one.
Now go try it again. Go on.

16:36.757 --> 16:40.523
Whoo! Yeah!

16:52.640 --> 16:56.076
Gosh, Doc. Didn't I tell you
to keep your thumb up?

16:56.143 --> 16:58.577
- No!
- I'm sorry.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.041
God!

17:02.116 --> 17:05.882
I guess I'll just have to...
grow a new one.

17:09.256 --> 17:12.248
Heh! Just a little
cowboy humor there, Wayne.

17:12.326 --> 17:14.487
Yeah. Giddap!

17:42.990 --> 17:45.288
Where you goin', Doc?

17:45.359 --> 17:49.557
Oh, I just... I thought I might
go home and have a hot bath,

17:49.630 --> 17:54.693
eat a little supper, have a hot
bath... Well, we got business in town.

17:54.769 --> 17:58.466
There's a buyer interested in one of our prize
bulls, and if you intend to run Riata with me,

17:58.539 --> 18:01.872
- I think maybe you better come along.
- Without a bath?

18:01.942 --> 18:04.274
You got it, cowboy.

18:04.345 --> 18:07.246
Bonanza was never like this.

18:21.328 --> 18:23.489
Wayne, I want a good hand.

18:23.564 --> 18:25.725
Yeah, I know you do.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.792
Now, Orly, you weren't serious
when you offered 6,000...

18:28.869 --> 18:31.997
for my prize-winnin' bull,
were you?

18:32.072 --> 18:37.442
I heard rumors that bull's gone the way
of Hollywood, if you know what I mean.

18:37.511 --> 18:42.676
Not true, Orly. Hell, half my
heifers are fightin'to get near him,

18:42.750 --> 18:45.947
and the other half
just sit back and admire his work.

18:46.020 --> 18:49.581
Now, don't ya think 7,500
would be a more Christian offer?

18:49.657 --> 18:51.591
Hmm.

18:53.327 --> 18:56.524
No, thanks.
I'll just stick with beer.

18:56.597 --> 18:59.691
Part of bein' a cowboy is bein' able to hold
your liquor while you're holdin' your cards.

18:59.767 --> 19:01.826
I said, no, thank you.
And I said drink it.

19:01.902 --> 19:03.301
- Wayne!
- What?

19:03.370 --> 19:06.430
Back off. Well, ante up, Doc.

19:06.507 --> 19:10.273
You're losin'bad, and I ain't marryin'
no man who can't beat me at poker.

19:13.013 --> 19:16.949
Tina and I met
over a poker table...

19:17.017 --> 19:19.008
in Las Vegas.

19:20.087 --> 19:23.352
I had a flush. She had a pair.

19:24.358 --> 19:26.349
Oh, what a pair.

19:26.427 --> 19:30.363
- Gimme two, Wayne.
- She ran out on me, Sam.

19:30.431 --> 19:33.525
She took my second-most-favorite organ...

19:33.601 --> 19:37.628
and stomped it to death
with her four-inch spike heels.

19:37.705 --> 19:42.199
- Coulda been worse.
- You tryin' to bluff us there, Doc?

19:47.147 --> 19:51.743
You'll never guess who she ran off with...
Gooshie.

19:51.819 --> 19:54.652
- Gooshie?
- Gooshie?

19:54.722 --> 19:56.713
Yeah. G-G-Gooshie.

19:56.790 --> 20:00.692
It's, uh, Navajo for...

20:01.862 --> 20:03.853
I'll see ya.

20:03.931 --> 20:06.661
You know,
you're wasting your money, Sam.

20:06.734 --> 20:09.567
Three kings.
He's got a full boat, aces over eights.

20:09.637 --> 20:11.571
Wayne?

20:11.639 --> 20:16.235
Yeah. Two dollars and, uh,

20:16.310 --> 20:18.244
two more.

20:18.312 --> 20:20.678
He's cheating.

20:20.748 --> 20:24.775
He took the best cards from the
last hand, three aces and two eights.

20:24.852 --> 20:27.013
That's what he's got,
aces and eights.

20:27.087 --> 20:28.117
What about it, Doc?

20:28.118 --> 20:32.184
You gonna stare into space like a
castrated steer, or are you gonna call me?

20:32.259 --> 20:34.625
- Can't beat a full boat.
- How do you know what I'm holding?

20:34.695 --> 20:37.528
Because you're cheating.

20:45.339 --> 20:47.739
- That's it.
- Hold it, Wayne.

20:50.311 --> 20:52.472
Doc, you better know
what you're sayin'.

20:52.546 --> 20:56.539
- I do. Tell them Wayne was palming,
- He was palming,

20:56.617 --> 20:58.608
stacking, shifting,
stacking, shifting...

20:58.686 --> 21:01.985
dealing seconds, dealing base,
dealing sides... cheating.

21:02.056 --> 21:04.650
- Cheating.
- That's why I know...

21:04.725 --> 21:08.388
that... he's got aces and eights.

21:09.897 --> 21:13.458
I got a right to stomp him, Chance.
Not if he's tellin' the truth.

21:13.534 --> 21:16.332
And there's an easy way to find out.

21:21.308 --> 21:24.004
He was cheating, Sam. I swear it.

21:27.514 --> 21:31.170
Uh, Wayne, look, I'm sorry.
I apologize. I just...

21:31.171 --> 21:32.747
That ain't good enough.

21:32.820 --> 21:34.515
Yes, it is.

21:37.191 --> 21:39.159
Buy me a drink, Wayne.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.130
Well, Orly, let's me and you
go talk a little bull. Eh, heh!

21:50.204 --> 21:52.604
I'll hold the money.

21:54.675 --> 21:56.140
Let's get something straight, Wayne.

21:56.141 --> 21:59.112
This is my test, and I'm gonna win it
fair or I'm not gonna win it at all.

21:59.179 --> 22:01.374
You gonna marry Doc?
I ain't marryin' no man.

22:01.448 --> 22:04.349
You are if he wins.
Doc can't out cowboy me.

22:04.418 --> 22:07.615
I don't know, Tess.
There's somethin' different about Doc.

22:07.688 --> 22:09.679
Aces and eights.

22:11.258 --> 22:13.783
That's a dead man's hand,
isn't it... isn't it?

22:14.995 --> 22:18.362
Isn't it?
Yeah, it is.

22:22.436 --> 22:27.100
Ah! Oh!
Turn over Tess's hand.

22:27.174 --> 22:31.474
Forget it, Al. You were wrong.
Sam, turn over Tess's hand.

22:32.479 --> 22:34.470
Come on!

22:36.617 --> 22:39.484
See, I knew it... aces and eights.

22:39.553 --> 22:42.681
He was cheatin'.
He dealt 'em to her so she could beat you.

22:44.825 --> 22:47.692
So that's how she's gonna play it.

23:03.777 --> 23:07.474
You oughta take some salt tablets
and some water.

23:07.548 --> 23:09.539
I ain't thirsty.

23:11.985 --> 23:14.078
No sense killin' yourself.

23:14.154 --> 23:16.952
You're two posts behind,
and there are only three holes left.

23:17.024 --> 23:21.324
- I don't need no help!
- Oh, Women's Lib is gonna love you.

23:21.395 --> 23:24.387
What's that?
Somethin' on the horizon,

23:24.465 --> 23:26.456
like that storm.

23:28.135 --> 23:30.365
We'll beat it. It's an hour off.

23:38.445 --> 23:40.436
Here.

23:40.514 --> 23:42.505
I ain't thirsty.

23:46.253 --> 23:48.414
Tess,

23:48.489 --> 23:50.650
you're pale,

23:50.724 --> 23:54.660
you're hot,
and I'll bet nauseous.

23:54.728 --> 23:58.095
I want you out of the sun.
I ain't no quitter.

23:58.165 --> 24:00.326
Look, nobody said you were.

24:00.400 --> 24:04.632
It's just, there's some things that...
that a man can do better than a woman.

24:04.705 --> 24:07.833
There ain't nothin' that
you can do better than me.

24:07.908 --> 24:11.105
And there are some things that a woman can
do better than a man, like havin' babies.

24:11.178 --> 24:16.206
Babies? I ain't havin' no babies.

24:16.283 --> 24:19.946
Isn't that why you're gettin' married, so you
can have children and keep Riata in the family?

24:20.020 --> 24:22.318
I ain't gettin' married.

24:22.389 --> 24:25.324
Well, you are if I can
keep up with you,

24:25.392 --> 24:27.883
and, uh, I figure that
I'm ahead on points.

24:30.230 --> 24:33.825
Come on. Let go of me! I ain't lettin' no man...

24:33.901 --> 24:35.892
Whoop.

24:58.225 --> 25:03.629
Pard and me
Pardon me for loving you

25:09.603 --> 25:12.504
What is it, Doc?

25:12.573 --> 25:17.476
Heat exhaustion. Get me a half teaspoon of salt
in a quart of cold water, and get me a washcloth.

25:17.544 --> 25:19.535
All right.

25:39.333 --> 25:42.700
Here you go, Doc. I got the well water
and salt like y'all... Oh, Lordy!

25:42.769 --> 25:44.964
Pour me a glass.

25:46.340 --> 25:50.037
She gonna be all right?
Soon as I get her cooled off...

25:50.110 --> 25:52.840
and get some fluids in her,
she'll be fine.

25:52.913 --> 25:55.074
Fetch me a fan, would ya?
All right.

25:55.148 --> 25:57.480
"Fetch. " I'm talkin' like them.

26:13.500 --> 26:17.368
I'll go get the animals.

26:17.437 --> 26:19.632
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

26:24.278 --> 26:28.647
What happened?
I mentioned babies and you fainted.

26:28.715 --> 26:34.051
I swooned?
Well, yeah. Uh, drink this.

26:36.823 --> 26:39.815
Salt water?
Just drink it, please.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.188
Why'd you bring me here?

26:48.189 --> 26:52.466
It's closer than your place. Now, just
drink a little bit more, and slowly.

26:54.207 --> 26:56.198
That's it.

27:02.916 --> 27:04.907
You... You man!

27:11.224 --> 27:13.215
Oh, that's smart.

27:13.293 --> 27:17.093
You're... You got heat prostration,
and you cover yourself up with a blanket.

27:17.164 --> 27:20.998
Pass out again if you want to.
I'll just take off all of your clothes.

27:25.238 --> 27:27.968
- Hi, Miss McGill. Feelin' any better?
- Hi, B...

27:30.777 --> 27:33.439
Doc, if you don't mind...
I put the animals up.

27:33.513 --> 27:36.744
I'd kinda like to get back.
Looks like it's gonna be a pretty big one.

27:36.817 --> 27:39.718
Yeah, well it's fine by me.

27:39.786 --> 27:42.619
Well, I better get home too.

27:42.689 --> 27:47.353
Yeah, you're not goin' anywhere
for at least an hour.

27:47.427 --> 27:49.418
You, uh...

27:50.430 --> 27:52.421
You want...

27:53.867 --> 27:56.427
You want the boy to stay?

27:58.405 --> 28:01.806
- No.
- Y'all take care now, you hear?

28:06.979 --> 28:10.172
Thank you for trusting me.

28:11.251 --> 28:14.379
I don't trust ya, Doc. I trust me.

28:24.464 --> 28:27.627
What's wrong with Piggy?

28:29.736 --> 28:32.000
She has allergies.

28:33.140 --> 28:35.131
What?

28:35.208 --> 28:39.838
Uh, she's allergic to something
on your ranch. She's fine here.

28:41.314 --> 28:43.805
Then you keep her.

28:43.884 --> 28:48.617
Well, thank you, Tess.
That's, uh... That's mighty nice.

28:50.057 --> 28:54.187
Just payment for the doctorin' and
the loan of the clothes, that's all.

28:56.329 --> 28:59.355
Shh, shh, shh. Easy.

28:59.433 --> 29:02.266
Easy, Piggy.
That ol' thunder can't hurt you.

29:03.804 --> 29:06.602
She can't understand you.

29:06.673 --> 29:10.165
I'm just usin' my voice to...
soothe her.

29:17.584 --> 29:19.882
Thunder scares me.

29:19.953 --> 29:24.856
Always has, always will.
I guess I'm no smarter than Piggy.

29:24.925 --> 29:28.417
There's no sin in bein' afraid.
It is in Texas.

29:32.699 --> 29:35.327
Well, I think the worst is over.

29:38.038 --> 29:41.166
You wanna dance?

29:41.241 --> 29:43.266
What?

29:43.343 --> 29:45.402
Dance.

29:51.016 --> 29:52.816
I don't dance.

30:35.860 --> 30:36.660
No!

30:37.531 --> 30:38.249
What did I do?

30:38.250 --> 30:39.863
It's not what you did.
It's what you're gonna do.

30:39.933 --> 30:41.867
I ain't gonna lose in here
what I won out there.

30:41.935 --> 30:44.961
I didn't think dancing
was part of the contest.

30:45.038 --> 30:46.437
Everything's part of the contest, Doc,

30:46.438 --> 30:49.566
and so far you ain't been able to keep up
with me at anything except posthole diggin'!

30:49.643 --> 30:53.636
And poker.
I figure I'm ahead in poker.

31:00.253 --> 31:02.517
I didn't know Wayne
was gonna do that.

31:06.893 --> 31:09.418
I'm-I'm glad you weren't in on it.

31:12.766 --> 31:16.099
So...
So...

31:16.169 --> 31:20.902
Uh, the way I see it, I bested you
in ropin', wranglin' and drinkin',

31:20.974 --> 31:23.807
and you got a leg up on me...

31:23.877 --> 31:28.246
in poker, posthole diggin'
and dancin'.

31:28.315 --> 31:32.718
Sounds like a tie to me. Contest
wasn't to tie me. It was to beat me.

31:32.786 --> 31:35.084
Well, I still have tomorrow.
Tomorrow's Sunday,

31:35.155 --> 31:40.320
and, unless you intend to out pray me,
you just lost, Doc.

31:40.393 --> 31:42.554
Look, Tess.

31:42.629 --> 31:44.756
Come on.
You owe me a tiebreaker.

31:48.768 --> 31:52.101
Okay. One last test.

31:52.172 --> 31:57.007
Shoot.
You want to marry me, Doc?

31:57.077 --> 31:59.068
Ride Widowmaker.

32:03.950 --> 32:05.941
That's what I thought.

32:33.747 --> 32:36.648
I like you, too, Piggy. Yeah.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.643
Funny thing is...

32:41.755 --> 32:45.589
Till we danced, I didn't realize
how much I liked her.

33:11.051 --> 33:13.042
Tess!

33:17.157 --> 33:19.625
I'm comin', Chance.
The Lord has waited all week for...

33:19.693 --> 33:23.390
Ain't that Doc
and Widowmaker down there?

33:26.032 --> 33:29.092
Al, Widowmaker.

33:29.169 --> 33:31.160
Oh, hello, Widowmaker.

33:32.205 --> 33:37.336
Do you know where she and that
jockstrap breath went over the weekend?

33:37.410 --> 33:42.074
To Vegas. Can you believe it? Our Vegas. Al.

33:42.148 --> 33:46.551
If that Tina came to me on her knees...
on her knees and begged me,

33:46.619 --> 33:49.816
I wouldn't give her the sweat off of my... Al.

33:51.291 --> 33:53.691
Oh, uh, you want me
to control the horse.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.194
Please.

33:56.262 --> 33:59.026
- Hey, Doc, you crazy?
- Ask Tess.

33:59.099 --> 34:03.559
He's gonna get himself killed.
Is this here part of the contest?

34:03.636 --> 34:05.831
This is the contest.

34:05.905 --> 34:08.703
Come on, boys!
He's gonna try her again!

34:08.775 --> 34:12.005
Ohhmmm.

34:12.078 --> 34:14.638
- You ready? Al?
- Ohhmmm.

34:14.714 --> 34:16.875
- Al?
- Yeah, yeah. Get on. Go ahead.

34:16.949 --> 34:20.043
Ohhmmm.

34:25.824 --> 34:28.123
Ohhmmm... What?

34:28.194 --> 34:32.960
No, I'm busy right now.
Ohhmmm.

34:33.032 --> 34:36.024
- No, I can't come to the phone right now.
- Al.

34:36.101 --> 34:38.969
Ohhmmm... Who is it?

34:39.938 --> 34:42.100
Tina? Uh, um...

34:42.175 --> 34:46.407
Uh, just... just stay right there
for a while, uh, Sam.

34:46.478 --> 34:49.277
I'll be right back, huh?
Yeah. Just...

34:49.349 --> 34:51.340
Just...

34:54.821 --> 34:56.344
Yee-aa-aah!

35:01.728 --> 35:03.628
Ride him, Doc!

35:04.664 --> 35:07.462
- Come on.
- Come on, Doc.

35:08.468 --> 35:09.992
Come on, Doc.
Come on, Doc.

35:12.305 --> 35:14.933
Come on, Doc!
Ride him!

35:16.242 --> 35:19.609
- Ride him, Doc!
- Come on, Doc!

35:33.693 --> 35:36.924
- God dang!
- All right. I seen some ridin' out there.

35:36.996 --> 35:39.658
Good ride, Doc.

35:39.732 --> 35:43.133
Good ride. You know, I think
Widowmaker could use a new name.

35:43.203 --> 35:47.299
- Welcome to the family, son.
- Thanks, but no thanks. I just, uh...

35:47.373 --> 35:51.537
I wanted to see if I could ride him,
not her.

36:11.030 --> 36:13.157
Oh, now, now, daughter.

36:13.233 --> 36:16.134
I guess the laugh's on me.
Nobody's laughin', Tess.

36:16.202 --> 36:18.432
They better not.

36:18.505 --> 36:21.167
Go after him.

36:21.241 --> 36:23.232
Chase a man?

36:23.309 --> 36:28.508
A calf has to be roped before you can
put your brand on him. Why not a man?

36:28.581 --> 36:30.572
It'd be humiliating.

36:30.650 --> 36:34.177
Any more than what you've
been doin' to Doc this past week?

36:34.254 --> 36:38.816
Tess, for once in your life, act
like a woman instead of a cowboy.

36:38.892 --> 36:41.190
Hmm?

36:43.830 --> 36:46.424
You gotta trust me, Doc.

36:46.499 --> 36:49.696
I'm doin' what I think is best.

36:49.769 --> 36:52.966
Winning a contest isn't enough.
I mean, she's gotta want...

36:53.039 --> 36:55.371
You always talk to yourself,
Doc?

36:56.376 --> 36:58.435
You always...

36:58.511 --> 37:01.674
come into a man's house
without knocking?

37:01.748 --> 37:03.841
Sorry.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.385
You oughta wear a dress more often.

37:06.452 --> 37:08.545
Kinda hard to work a ranch
wearin' a dress.

37:08.621 --> 37:11.488
- Don't you ever back off?
- Can't afford to.

37:11.558 --> 37:16.110
Oh, yeah, I forgot. You're a Texan, and
Texans gotta be tougher than rawhide.

37:16.111 --> 37:17.394
What do you want, Tess?

37:17.463 --> 37:20.899
Well, I was just wonderin'...

37:20.967 --> 37:25.563
...why you risked your life
for 50,000 acres of prime Texas land...

37:25.638 --> 37:26.849
and then turned it down.

37:26.850 --> 37:29.472
Is that what you think this
is about? Getting Riata?

37:29.542 --> 37:33.911
- Well, it sure as hell ain't about love.
- You speakin' for me or for yourself?

37:37.483 --> 37:41.886
Doc, in all the years
we've known each other,

37:41.955 --> 37:45.391
the only thing we ever talked
about was sick critters.

37:48.227 --> 37:52.789
- Okay, uh, how about those Dodgers?
- What?

37:52.865 --> 37:58.303
Look, Tess, it's hard to talk to you
about anything except Riata.

37:58.371 --> 38:03.604
Especially if, uh...
I mean, if a fella's shy.

38:03.676 --> 38:06.873
You never struck me as bein' shy. Well, I was.

38:06.946 --> 38:09.881
At least I was when
it came to expressing...

38:10.883 --> 38:13.113
my feelings for you.

38:15.254 --> 38:17.245
So, uh,

38:19.092 --> 38:21.253
I wrote 'em all down.

38:54.494 --> 38:56.792
This isn't fair, you know.

38:56.863 --> 38:59.923
You can't expect me to do this
and not get involved.

38:59.999 --> 39:02.900
So if Tess falls in love with Doc,

39:02.969 --> 39:07.338
I'd appreciate it if you'd just
leap me outta here as soon as possible.

39:12.879 --> 39:14.870
Doc.

39:16.482 --> 39:19.781
Can we dance?

39:19.852 --> 39:21.843
Sure.

39:38.137 --> 39:43.632
Doc, Riata's in my blood.
I just can't give her up.

39:43.710 --> 39:45.905
Nobody's askin' you to.

39:45.978 --> 39:50.540
But if I marry you, then all the men'll
look to you after Chance is gone.

39:52.085 --> 39:54.246
Couldn't we run it together?

40:00.960 --> 40:02.951
Together?

40:03.963 --> 40:05.954
Together.

40:21.180 --> 40:24.513
<i>Tess! Tess McGill!</i>

40:24.584 --> 40:27.451
<i>I know you're in there.!</i>

40:28.154 --> 40:30.918
Wayne, what're you doin' here?

40:30.990 --> 40:33.584
I wanna know if you're marryin' Doc.

40:33.659 --> 40:36.958
Well, that's none
of your damn business.

40:37.029 --> 40:39.554
Now, Tess, I figure it is.

40:40.566 --> 40:43.763
I ain't been bustin' my butt for you all
these years to have you go run off with Doc.

40:43.836 --> 40:46.304
You were paid for every day you worked,
and plenty you didn't.

40:46.372 --> 40:50.172
Do you think I worked at Riata for
three squares and 50 bucks a month?

40:53.479 --> 40:57.779
I ain't some bowlegged cowboy
like Eddie or Zeke.

40:57.850 --> 41:01.911
I... I was hopin' some day to rope you.

41:01.988 --> 41:04.821
- You mean Riata.
- You can keep Riata.

41:08.394 --> 41:10.862
I want you.

41:10.930 --> 41:12.921
What?

41:20.206 --> 41:22.470
I love you, Tess.

41:22.542 --> 41:24.942
I have ever since
the first day I rode in.

41:25.011 --> 41:27.002
Just...

41:29.615 --> 41:32.243
Just never had the guts to say so.

41:34.587 --> 41:37.215
But I wrote these letters.

42:01.280 --> 42:05.341
Would you mind
if I danced with Wayne...

42:06.819 --> 42:09.219
just to see how it feels?

42:11.991 --> 42:15.358
Uh...
No. Sure.

42:19.932 --> 42:21.923
Uh...

42:25.004 --> 42:28.371
I don't know how to dance, Tess.

42:28.441 --> 42:32.070
That's okay. I'll lead.

42:43.456 --> 42:46.152
<i>Wayne danced about as well as I did... </i>

42:46.225 --> 42:50.559
<i>with Miss Morgan</i>
<i>at my kindergarten graduation. </i>

42:50.630 --> 42:55.761
<i>She married the principal that summer, and I
didn't get over it until I met Miss Sedlack. </i>

42:55.835 --> 43:00.033
<i>She was my first-grade teacher. </i>

43:00.106 --> 43:03.564
<i>I hoped getting over Tess</i>
<i>wouldn't take as long. </i>

43:07.513 --> 43:09.981
At least you're still my girl.

43:10.049 --> 43:12.643
Oop.

43:12.718 --> 43:14.709
That's it.

43:18.791 --> 43:21.555
- Fickle.
- You're lookin'pretty sharp, Sam.

43:24.864 --> 43:28.630
Oh, hello. I love those silver tips
on your boots. Those are nice.

43:28.701 --> 43:33.900
And, oh, you've got matching ones
on your collar. Ha-ha! "Trés" western.

43:33.973 --> 43:38.000
Oh, come on, Sam. Gimme a break.
I knew you could ride that nag.

43:38.077 --> 43:44.016
Nag? You call that half ton of Texas
lightning that tried to castrate me a nag?

43:44.083 --> 43:46.643
Yeah, but he didn't.
You rode him, cowboy!

43:46.719 --> 43:49.187
Oh, gee, shucks, Mr. Dillon.

43:49.255 --> 43:53.453
Sam, if I hadn't taken that phone call,
I would have lost Tina forever.

43:53.526 --> 43:55.517
She's back?
Yeah.

43:55.594 --> 44:00.224
She gave Gooshie a case
of mouthwash and sent him packing.

44:00.299 --> 44:03.097
She only did it
to make me jealous.

44:03.169 --> 44:06.764
And-And she never slept
with that rotten bum.

44:10.176 --> 44:12.974
I believe her.
You believed Ziggy.

44:13.045 --> 44:15.741
Well, technically Ziggy wasn't wrong.

44:15.815 --> 44:19.876
He said he predicted Tess would marry
someone who wrote her love letters.

44:19.952 --> 44:22.113
You're right, Al.
Yeah. Of course.

44:22.188 --> 44:24.349
I can't blame Ziggy.
No.

44:24.423 --> 44:27.358
I mean, you were the one who said
I had to marry her to leap. Me?

44:27.426 --> 44:30.554
Yeah, you.
I don't know that I ever said that.

44:30.629 --> 44:34.793
I do. Well, I, uh... You know,
I never really believed it.

44:34.867 --> 44:37.859
You didn't, huh?
Did you?

44:39.105 --> 44:41.437
Come here. Come here.

44:41.507 --> 44:43.498
What?
Look in here.

44:46.979 --> 44:48.970
Check it out.

44:50.049 --> 44:52.040
Go on.

44:57.189 --> 45:00.249
You had a lot to overcome, Sam.

45:04.196 --> 45:06.187
Hi, Doc.

45:14.874 --> 45:17.035
Could you just once use the door?

45:22.782 --> 45:24.773
Happy?
Thank you.

45:27.153 --> 45:30.418
Best man's lookin'real sharp.
Sharp indeed.

45:30.489 --> 45:33.219
Thanks, son.

45:34.393 --> 45:38.090
Uh, Tess getting married might still
be your ticket out of here.

45:38.164 --> 45:40.394
Ziggy's sayin' there's
a 50-50 chance...

45:40.466 --> 45:44.300
that you'll leap the minute
she says, "I do. " Ziggy.

45:44.370 --> 45:46.361
Uh, you seen Piggy?

45:46.439 --> 45:49.234
She's around here someplace.
You want me to go find her?

45:49.235 --> 45:50.705
No, that's okay. I'll look.

45:50.776 --> 45:52.767
Piggy?

45:54.246 --> 45:56.237
Piggy.

45:58.150 --> 46:00.482
<i>Piggy</i>

46:01.487 --> 46:03.921
Here, Piggy. Souee!

46:03.989 --> 46:06.082
<i>Piggy souee</i>

46:06.158 --> 46:09.025
Piggy. Piggy souee.

46:09.095 --> 46:11.563
<i>Piggy souee, piggy souee</i>

46:11.630 --> 46:14.599
<i>Oh, how my heart yearns for you</i>

46:14.667 --> 46:16.862
<i>Oh, Piggy</i>

46:16.936 --> 46:19.029
<i>My Piggy souee</i>

46:20.372 --> 46:24.570
<i>Well, I love you, gal
and I need you, Piggy, souee</i>

46:24.643 --> 46:28.943
Why don't you go ahead and try it? Buddy.

46:29.014 --> 46:31.574
Yeah, Doc?

46:31.650 --> 46:36.519
Uh, why don't you try "Peggy Sue"?
It might sound a little better.

46:36.589 --> 46:38.580
All right.

46:43.462 --> 46:46.363
<i>Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue</i>

46:46.432 --> 46:48.866
<i>Oh, how my heart yearns for you</i>

46:48.934 --> 46:51.061
<i>Oh, oh, Peggy</i>

46:51.137 --> 46:54.868
<i>My Peggy Sue</i>

46:54.940 --> 46:59.377
<i>Well, I love you, gal</i>
<i>and I need you, Peggy Sue</i>

47:01.046 --> 47:04.243
<i>Oh, I need you, Peggy Sue</i>

47:04.316 --> 47:06.807
<i>With a love that's rare and true</i>

47:06.886 --> 47:11.118
<i>Oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue</i>

47:11.190 --> 47:13.181
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

47:13.259 --> 47:17.161
<i>Well, I love you, gal</i>
<i>and I need you, Peggy Sue</i>

47:19.365 --> 47:22.061
Thanks, Frankie. You was terrific.
