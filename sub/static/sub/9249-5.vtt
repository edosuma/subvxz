WEBVTT

00:03.873 --> 00:04.939
That's it.

00:04.942 --> 00:07.175
Hold that son of a bitch closer.

00:07.177 --> 00:08.977
Come on, change.

00:08.979 --> 00:10.946
Damn you, change!

00:10.948 --> 00:13.515
Oh, just get new batteries.

00:13.517 --> 00:15.383
This is not your fight, Joyce.

00:15.385 --> 00:16.918
VINCE: Let the man be.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.320
There's two things I
never question him on...

00:18.322 --> 00:19.587
how to handle a remote,

00:19.589 --> 00:21.990
and how long to warm a piece of pie.

00:23.659 --> 00:24.993
There.

00:24.995 --> 00:27.762
I can lick another two
months out of these batteries.

00:27.764 --> 00:29.230
MOLLY: I did it!

00:29.232 --> 00:32.433
(laughing gleefully): I
finished! I finished the book!

00:32.435 --> 00:36.471
If the only copy wasn't on
this laptop, I would spike it!

00:36.473 --> 00:39.140
(whooping)

00:39.142 --> 00:41.309
Hey! Hey!

00:41.311 --> 00:42.343
Good for you.

00:42.345 --> 00:43.378
Way to go.

00:43.380 --> 00:44.913
Congratulations.

00:44.915 --> 00:46.781
Okay, where is the love?

00:46.783 --> 00:50.485
You did the wave when
Vince got out of jury duty.

00:50.487 --> 00:52.653
Honey, this is the fifth time
you've finished that book,

00:52.655 --> 00:54.689
only to go back for another rewrite.

00:54.691 --> 00:56.091
First time, we did a conga line.

00:57.426 --> 00:59.328
Second time, you woke us
up at 3:00 in the morning

00:59.330 --> 01:01.696
to sing, "She's a Molly Good Fellow."

01:03.332 --> 01:05.000
Fourth time... was that when she wanted

01:05.001 --> 01:06.901
to fire Mike's police pistol in the air?

01:06.903 --> 01:08.503
Well, I didn't really want to shoot it.

01:08.505 --> 01:10.705
I just wanted to, you know,
wave it around in the air.

01:10.707 --> 01:14.476
You, little lady, are
the girl who cried "book."

01:14.478 --> 01:18.847
All right, I admit it, there
has been a couple false alarms,

01:18.849 --> 01:20.348
but this time I am serious.

01:20.350 --> 01:21.649
I am finished.

01:21.651 --> 01:23.651
- You're sure?
- Yes.

01:23.653 --> 01:25.587
Look me in the eye and say it.

01:25.589 --> 01:28.856
Feed it, burp it and put it to
bed, 'cause this baby's done.

01:28.858 --> 01:29.824
(laughs)

01:29.826 --> 01:31.025
- That's my girl.
- Aw...

01:31.027 --> 01:32.493
I'll get the champagne.

01:32.495 --> 01:33.628
Congratulations, sweetie.

01:33.630 --> 01:34.696
I'm proud of you.

01:34.698 --> 01:36.030
I can't remember all the nice things I said

01:36.032 --> 01:37.599
the third time you were
done, but I mean it.

01:37.601 --> 01:39.233
Well, thank you.

01:39.235 --> 01:40.902
And this rewrite was a doozy.

01:40.904 --> 01:43.471
I took two characters
and merged them into one.

01:43.473 --> 01:45.406
And, you know, they were male and a female,

01:45.408 --> 01:46.841
so I had to choose the gender

01:46.843 --> 01:48.242
and then switch all the pronouns... ugh.

01:48.244 --> 01:50.945
You know, it would have been
easier if you just combined them

01:50.947 --> 01:52.947
into one of them LGBLTs.

01:52.949 --> 01:55.316
Well...

01:55.318 --> 01:57.318
Okay, Vince, you can't just...

01:57.320 --> 01:58.386
Hey...

01:58.388 --> 01:59.754
No.

01:59.756 --> 02:01.455
I don't have a transgender character.

02:01.457 --> 02:02.690
No, you don't need one.

02:02.692 --> 02:05.259
I read your book, at first
because I felt I had to,

02:05.261 --> 02:06.727
but then I really liked it.

02:06.729 --> 02:08.596
Ooh, but this will make it so much better.

02:08.598 --> 02:10.564
Don't worry, this will
not be a big rewrite.

02:10.566 --> 02:12.933
I will be shooting that gun off in no time.

02:14.870 --> 02:18.072
Flag on the play... jackass
here gave her an idea.

02:18.074 --> 02:19.473
How the hell was I supposed to know

02:19.475 --> 02:21.108
I was gonna say something insightful?

02:22.611 --> 02:23.778
What are you doing?

02:23.780 --> 02:25.379
Oh, don't worry... I bought a case.

02:25.381 --> 02:28.082
This turned out to be a fun drinking game.

03:03.167 --> 03:04.666
Don't bother, she can't hear you.

03:04.668 --> 03:05.834
She's in a zone.

03:05.836 --> 03:07.469
Here, watch this.

03:07.471 --> 03:09.438
That's not really a
birthmark on your leg...

03:09.440 --> 03:11.606
I dropped a cigarette in your crib.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.375
See?

03:13.377 --> 03:16.511
I mean, I'm telling her stuff
I was saving for my deathbed.

- Hey!
- Hey!

03:32.362 --> 03:35.397
Hey! Good morning, sunshine.

03:35.399 --> 03:36.598
Mike, I was writing.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.533
- You're always writing.
- That's true.

03:38.535 --> 03:40.468
I come home from drinking, you're writing.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.570
I get up to smoke a bowl, you're writing.

03:43.706 --> 03:46.641
Honey, you have a serious problem.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.143
I don't have a problem.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.577
And I'm so close to being done.

03:49.579 --> 03:50.712
I even have a title.

03:50.714 --> 03:52.747
Mm, she never had a title before.

03:52.749 --> 03:53.982
That's just bargaining.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.317
She'll do anything to
score a couple more days.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.652
Let her talk.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.387
So, what's your title?

03:59.389 --> 04:01.055
Well, I wanted something succinct,

04:01.057 --> 04:02.957
but still, you know, to convey passion.

04:02.959 --> 04:05.860
<i>So what do you think
about, Within Her Walls?</i>

04:05.862 --> 04:06.894
I love it.

04:06.896 --> 04:08.563
That's great.

04:08.565 --> 04:09.731
Print and send.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.632
Uh, I...

04:11.634 --> 04:13.935
It just scares me that you all like it.

04:13.937 --> 04:16.070
Why?

04:16.072 --> 04:18.272
Well, I love you all, but
you're way too supportive.

04:18.274 --> 04:19.774
I mean, "You're brilliant,"
"You're amazing,"

04:19.776 --> 04:21.242
"You can't go wrong... " (babbles)

04:21.244 --> 04:22.977
What am I supposed to do with that?

04:22.979 --> 04:25.546
I mean, all this love
and support is exactly why

04:25.548 --> 04:27.081
I sent my book to your mom.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.750
Molly, are you nuts?

04:29.752 --> 04:32.219
I grew up with her criticism, it's brutal.

04:32.221 --> 04:36.424
Her words don't just cut,
they burrow in and lay eggs.

04:36.426 --> 04:38.259
I know, and that's exactly
what I'm looking for.

04:38.261 --> 04:41.362
Mike, I don't need a pat on the
back, I need a kick in the ass.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.297
And Peggy's not afraid
to give it to me good.

04:43.299 --> 04:46.333
"Give it to me good."

04:46.335 --> 04:48.235
Now that's a great title.

04:48.237 --> 04:50.604
It's a little on the nose.

04:50.606 --> 04:52.439
"A little on the nose"?

04:52.441 --> 04:54.742
That's even better.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.282
(doorbell rings twice)

05:04.185 --> 05:05.953
Hey, Peggy, did you get a chance...

05:05.955 --> 05:07.121
Oh.

05:07.123 --> 05:08.756
I'm sorry.

05:08.758 --> 05:11.692
Am I interrupting your, um, coven?

05:11.694 --> 05:14.995
It's my church book group,
but you're not far off.

05:14.997 --> 05:16.463
Joan used to be a Methodist.

05:16.465 --> 05:18.599
Lutheran.

05:18.601 --> 05:19.900
That's between you and God.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.870
I'm not the one who has to forgive you.

05:22.872 --> 05:23.837
Nice to meet you.

05:23.839 --> 05:25.339
- No, come on in.
- Oh.

05:25.341 --> 05:27.374
This is my daughter-in-law, Molly.

05:27.376 --> 05:28.442
The writer.

05:28.444 --> 05:29.843
ALL: Oh...

05:29.845 --> 05:32.279
Your book is very blue.

05:32.281 --> 05:34.281
Wait, you let them read it?

05:34.283 --> 05:35.248
Sure.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.850
This is right in their wheelhouse.

05:36.852 --> 05:39.119
Mickey was married eight times,

05:39.121 --> 05:40.754
Joan slept with a lady once,

05:40.756 --> 05:43.590
and Rose shacked up with
an Indian for 30 years.

05:43.592 --> 05:46.326
Not the casino kind, the 7-Eleven kind.

05:47.528 --> 05:49.262
You know what they say...

05:49.264 --> 05:51.631
there's nothing a Hindu won't do.

05:51.633 --> 05:53.366
(laughing)

05:53.368 --> 05:56.703
Well, Peggy, I don't know if
my book was ready for this.

05:56.705 --> 06:00.974
It was just for friends and family and you.

06:00.976 --> 06:02.776
Too late... these gals ate it up.

06:02.778 --> 06:05.579
Oh, like the way Milly
in your book gobbled up

06:05.581 --> 06:07.447
that stuttering pool boy.

06:07.449 --> 06:08.915
He wasn't a stutterer.

06:08.917 --> 06:11.084
He was just nervous 'cause
his step-aunt was giving him

06:11.086 --> 06:13.086
the old "crooked corkscrew."

06:13.088 --> 06:15.522
Where I'm from, we called
it the "little Jack Horner."

06:15.524 --> 06:18.458
You mean the "randy hitchhiker."

06:18.460 --> 06:20.426
We're all saying the same thing.

06:20.428 --> 06:23.229
I... I don't know that we are.

06:23.231 --> 06:25.064
Well, then you might want to take notes.

06:25.066 --> 06:29.068
These old buzzards talk fast and
don't remember a word they say.

06:29.070 --> 06:30.403
(chuckles)

06:30.405 --> 06:32.672
I like your outfit.

06:32.674 --> 06:35.141
Are you the lady-dabbler?

06:35.143 --> 06:36.709
Yeah? Okay.

06:39.179 --> 06:41.147
I'll take the scrambled
eggs, he'll have the oatmeal.

06:41.149 --> 06:42.849
I don't feel like oatmeal today.

06:42.851 --> 06:44.550
But it's Monday.

06:44.552 --> 06:46.185
I know what day it is.

06:46.187 --> 06:47.520
I want to hear the specials.

06:47.522 --> 06:48.521
Since when?

06:48.523 --> 06:50.022
In all the time I've known you,

06:50.024 --> 06:51.491
it's been "Oatmeal Monday,"
"Egg Whites Tuesdays,"

06:51.493 --> 06:53.326
"Corn Flakes Wednesdays,"
"Turkey Bacon Thursdays,"

06:53.328 --> 06:56.963
and "Fresh Fruit So You
Eat Half My Omelet Friday."

06:56.965 --> 06:58.498
I'm branching out.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.532
Let's hear 'em.

06:59.534 --> 07:01.834
Well, there's the salmon Benedict,

07:01.836 --> 07:05.037
uh, bacon quiche, vegetable frittata...

07:05.039 --> 07:07.740
You know what, I really don't
feel comfortable with this.

07:07.742 --> 07:09.208
What is your hang-up?

07:09.210 --> 07:10.710
A man wants to try something different.

07:10.712 --> 07:12.044
What are you so scared of?

07:12.046 --> 07:14.080
Maybe because there are
few certainties in life,

07:14.082 --> 07:15.815
and your stomach is one of them.

07:16.984 --> 07:19.385
Mm-hmm, like a
lactose-intolerant Swiss watch.

07:20.787 --> 07:23.222
Believe me, I didn't come to
this new way of thinking easily.

07:23.224 --> 07:24.890
I was reading something the other day...

07:24.892 --> 07:26.559
Uh... he's reading, too.

07:28.462 --> 07:29.762
It was in Molly's book.

07:29.764 --> 07:31.730
It's all about trying new
things, giving up control,

07:31.732 --> 07:33.499
and losing yourself in the experience.

07:33.501 --> 07:35.401
- That was in Molly's book?
- Yeah.

07:35.403 --> 07:38.070
I mean, the chapter was about
a lady taking on three guys,

07:38.072 --> 07:40.572
but you can apply that to breakfast food.

07:40.574 --> 07:42.074
You been applying any of
that new adventurous nature

07:42.076 --> 07:43.509
into the bedroom?

07:43.511 --> 07:44.543
Oh, God, no.

07:44.545 --> 07:45.811
It's still lights off, T-shirt on.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.346
But I will say... the other night,

07:47.348 --> 07:51.283
my T-shirt rolled up, I
didn't pull it back down.

07:53.086 --> 07:56.021
You know something, I
will have that frittata.

07:56.023 --> 07:57.256
I like your style.

07:57.258 --> 07:58.824
I'll have the oatmeal.

08:02.962 --> 08:04.630
You say "engorged" quite a bit.

08:04.632 --> 08:07.933
It's a good word, but I
feel like it can be overused.

08:07.935 --> 08:09.234
You're right, okay, you're right.

08:09.236 --> 08:11.770
But it does paint a picture.

08:11.772 --> 08:15.374
You could use "swollen,"
"enlarged," "full," "inflamed."

08:15.376 --> 08:17.376
"Inflamed" sounds like there's
something wrong with it.

08:17.378 --> 08:19.711
Like it's discolored, or there's a rash.

08:20.813 --> 08:22.347
All right, ladies, she has a thesaurus.

08:22.349 --> 08:23.949
Let's give her something concrete.

08:23.951 --> 08:26.685
A... are there any moments where
you thought it went too far?

08:26.687 --> 08:27.886
Oh, God, no.

08:27.888 --> 08:29.888
If anything, you could go further.

08:29.890 --> 08:33.491
I may regret asking this, but further how?

08:33.494 --> 08:36.461
Why can't a woman get
roughed up in your book?

08:36.462 --> 08:38.563
Uh, hair-pulling is very in right now.

08:38.765 --> 08:39.864
ROSE: I'd try it,

08:39.866 --> 08:43.134
but mine's already
coming out by the fistful.

08:43.135 --> 08:45.837
I'm not really comfortable
with, you know, that rough stuff.

08:45.839 --> 08:47.872
How can you expect your
characters to let go,

08:47.874 --> 08:48.807
if you can't?

08:48.809 --> 08:49.774
I did let go.

08:49.776 --> 08:51.209
Did you read chapter seven?

08:51.211 --> 08:53.578
It's a nude cotillion.

08:53.580 --> 08:56.848
A naked minuet is very erotic.

08:56.850 --> 08:58.950
I don't think she's ready for this.

08:58.952 --> 09:01.086
No, (stammers) I am ready.

09:01.088 --> 09:02.520
If you don't think I've gone far enough,

09:02.522 --> 09:03.922
then... (breathes deeply)

09:03.924 --> 09:08.760
let's hear where you think I should go.

09:08.762 --> 09:10.261
You should delve into fantasies.

09:10.263 --> 09:12.297
That shows where the person wants to go

09:12.299 --> 09:13.898
but is afraid to.

09:13.900 --> 09:17.202
I've always wanted to
make love to a centaur.

09:18.537 --> 09:20.438
Is that the half-man, half-horse?

09:20.440 --> 09:23.775
Yeah, I grew up on a farm.

09:23.777 --> 09:26.444
You're a strange little bird, aren't you?

09:26.446 --> 09:28.613
You don't know the half of it, honey.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.586
<i>MIKE: Molly?</i>

09:35.588 --> 09:37.755
In here.

09:42.628 --> 09:44.962
I told you my mom was rough.

09:44.964 --> 09:47.632
It wasn't your mom, it
was your mom's friends.

09:47.634 --> 09:49.333
Her church friends?

09:49.335 --> 09:50.735
Aw, they're a cute bunch.

09:50.737 --> 09:51.602
No, they're not.

09:51.604 --> 09:53.971
They are dirty, dirty birds.

09:53.973 --> 09:57.375
They wanted me to take my
book to a dark, dark place,

09:57.377 --> 09:58.876
so I'm just gonna stay in here

09:58.878 --> 10:01.145
until I can remember
something sweet and innocent

10:01.147 --> 10:03.581
like holding hands or my first kiss.

10:03.583 --> 10:06.484
Okay, but why in the closet?

10:06.486 --> 10:07.985
Because this is where it happened.

10:07.987 --> 10:10.988
"Seven minutes in
heaven" with Stevie Dugan.

10:10.990 --> 10:12.823
It was my 14th birthday party.

10:12.825 --> 10:15.059
Father Dugan?

10:16.094 --> 10:19.096
Not at the time.

10:19.098 --> 10:22.166
I don't know, maybe I should
just start the whole book over,

10:22.168 --> 10:24.868
tear it apart and build it
back up from the beginning.

10:24.870 --> 10:26.904
You know, just rethink the whole thing.

10:26.906 --> 10:28.105
What are you talking about?

10:28.107 --> 10:29.406
Sweetie, you're making yourself insane.

10:29.408 --> 10:31.508
What you wrote is great.

10:31.510 --> 10:32.977
Yeah, but it could be better.

10:32.979 --> 10:34.978
You know what you're doing, don't you?

10:34.980 --> 10:38.182
This is my Super Bowl
guacamole all over again.

10:39.417 --> 10:44.021
I can't hear that story one more time.

10:48.526 --> 10:51.261
Well, you're gonna hear it.

10:51.263 --> 10:54.564
Because a valuable lesson
was learned that horrible day.

10:54.566 --> 10:58.302
Oh, when I first mixed
it up, it was delicious.

10:58.304 --> 11:00.103
Damn near perfect.

11:00.105 --> 11:03.173
But I thought I could
make it better, you see?

11:03.175 --> 11:05.208
And I added more lemon,

11:05.210 --> 11:06.510
and... and I added more peppers,

11:06.512 --> 11:08.545
and then Vince said, "Put in salsa."

11:08.547 --> 11:10.580
And then I panicked.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.549
I put in olives.

11:12.551 --> 11:16.052
And pickles.

11:16.054 --> 11:18.255
And something called capers.

11:21.058 --> 11:22.792
And in the end, in the end,

11:22.794 --> 11:24.928
even flies wouldn't land on it.

11:27.031 --> 11:29.165
You still ate it!

11:29.167 --> 11:31.368
That is not my point!

11:33.104 --> 11:34.504
You know what, you know what,

11:34.506 --> 11:36.873
there's no reason to talk about it anymore.

11:38.709 --> 11:40.176
Wh...

11:40.178 --> 11:42.145
Mike?

11:42.147 --> 11:45.181
Mike?!

11:45.183 --> 11:47.350
Are you still there?

11:50.521 --> 11:51.754
What are you doing?

11:51.756 --> 11:53.490
Just finishing up something.

11:53.492 --> 11:55.692
Then we're gonna go
make out in that closet.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.461
There. Done.

11:58.463 --> 11:59.662
What'd you do?

11:59.664 --> 12:01.331
I did what you should have
done a couple of weeks ago.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.099
I sent your book to your publisher.

12:03.101 --> 12:04.367
You're welcome.

12:04.369 --> 12:06.836
You what?

12:06.838 --> 12:07.870
Hey. Hey.

12:07.872 --> 12:09.806
I know you can't see it right now,

12:09.808 --> 12:12.108
but I just saved your guacamole.

12:12.110 --> 12:13.776
Oh, my God, you sent it.

12:13.778 --> 12:15.411
You actually sent it.

12:15.413 --> 12:17.413
Why would you do something like that?!

12:17.415 --> 12:18.915
Oh, my God!

12:19.917 --> 12:21.884
Know what this is?!

12:21.886 --> 12:24.086
This. Is. Your. Face.

12:26.957 --> 12:29.158
(screams)

12:40.842 --> 12:42.676
MIKE: Oh, come...

12:42.678 --> 12:44.078
Come on, Molly.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.746
Look, I did it for your own good.

12:45.748 --> 12:47.448
<i>No, you did it for your own good.</i>

12:47.450 --> 12:49.350
You just wanted your
doting little wife back.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.185
"Doting"?

12:51.187 --> 12:52.820
Are you saying I don't
take good care of you?

12:52.822 --> 12:54.255
Of course you do.

12:54.257 --> 12:55.522
You just don't dote.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.091
Why am I even talking to you?

12:57.093 --> 12:58.692
Girls, let's go, we're going drinking.

12:58.694 --> 12:59.560
What's the occasion?

12:59.562 --> 13:00.761
Mike sent in my book.

13:00.763 --> 13:02.530
- Congratulations!
- Oh! Hey!

13:02.532 --> 13:04.632
ALL: ♪ For she's a
Molly good fellow... ♪

13:04.634 --> 13:05.900
No, no!

13:05.902 --> 13:07.868
No, not in a good way.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.103
But we're still going drinking, right?

13:09.105 --> 13:10.237
You can't un-ring that bell.

13:10.239 --> 13:12.806
Just like you can't un-send an e-mail.

13:12.808 --> 13:14.908
Mol, come on, your book's great.

13:14.910 --> 13:16.944
Well, you have to say
that, you're my husband.

13:16.946 --> 13:20.280
I said the same thing about your
crappy Super Bowl Franken-guac.

13:27.121 --> 13:28.589
If I didn't push that button,

13:28.591 --> 13:30.257
she would have never handed it in.

13:30.259 --> 13:31.758
It was the right thing to do.

13:31.760 --> 13:32.859
Obviously.

13:32.861 --> 13:35.128
Everything worked out great.

13:41.469 --> 13:42.803
What do you think, Harry?

13:42.805 --> 13:44.071
Can you get the e-mail back?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.906
That is the $64 question.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.141
Which actually is my hourly rate.

13:48.143 --> 13:50.977
But you're a friend, so you
can just take me to dinner.

13:50.979 --> 13:52.612
Probably cheaper to pay him.

13:53.881 --> 13:55.449
Listen, Harry, you get this book back

13:55.451 --> 13:56.917
before Molly's publisher reads it,

13:56.919 --> 14:00.854
I will chew up a prime rib and
feed it to you like a baby bird.

14:00.856 --> 14:02.656
I can't believe you're
already backing down.

14:02.658 --> 14:05.392
Hey, Mike Biggs does not back down.

14:05.394 --> 14:07.260
He may, however, raise the white flag,

14:07.262 --> 14:09.062
so he doesn't get a black eye.

14:09.064 --> 14:12.298
You should have seen
what she did to that ball.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.067
Well, you are a similar shape.

14:14.069 --> 14:16.169
HARRY: Quiet, guys.

14:16.171 --> 14:19.072
I got to get past this firewall.

14:19.074 --> 14:22.075
Boy, this is a lot trickier than I thought.

14:22.077 --> 14:23.977
Uh, Mike, hand me that hair clip.

14:25.846 --> 14:28.381
This guy is locked up tight.

14:28.383 --> 14:30.416
Give me that!

14:30.418 --> 14:31.518
That's disgusting.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.554
Use car keys, like a normal person.

14:34.556 --> 14:37.891
You know, we could save
ourselves a lot of trouble

14:37.893 --> 14:40.293
if I just sent this
publisher a Trojan virus.

14:40.295 --> 14:41.094
The hell's that?

14:41.496 --> 14:42.829
It's the nuclear option.

14:42.831 --> 14:45.265
He gets an innocent little
e-mail with the subject line,

14:45.267 --> 14:47.800
"Jessica Alba nip slip."

14:47.802 --> 14:49.269
He's intrigued.

14:49.271 --> 14:50.603
Curious.

14:50.605 --> 14:52.605
He clicks it and... boom.

14:52.607 --> 14:54.073
His hard drive is fried.

14:54.075 --> 14:55.842
And, suddenly, he's an organ donor,

14:55.844 --> 14:58.678
whether he likes it or not.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.781
You know, these computers
give you freaks too much power.

15:01.783 --> 15:04.951
The lunch tables have turned.

15:04.953 --> 15:07.220
All right, look, no nip slips, no viruses,

15:07.222 --> 15:10.423
and you are never
borrowing my car keys again.

15:15.095 --> 15:18.931
Just call your publisher and
explain to him what happened.

15:18.933 --> 15:20.666
I can't talk to him.

15:20.668 --> 15:22.935
I've told so many lies about
why I couldn't hand the book in

15:22.937 --> 15:25.504
that I've lost track. I'm
either admitting you to rehab

15:25.506 --> 15:29.408
or rescuing you from a doomsday cult.

15:29.410 --> 15:32.711
Thank you for not putting me in rehab.

15:32.713 --> 15:34.814
Mike had no right to send that book in.

15:34.816 --> 15:36.916
I'm the only one that
should decide when it's done.

15:36.918 --> 15:39.719
That's true. It was your choice to make.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.687
Even if you were never gonna send it in.

15:41.689 --> 15:44.290
I was gonna send it in. Eventually.

15:44.292 --> 15:45.658
M... maybe.

15:45.660 --> 15:48.594
Probably.

15:48.596 --> 15:50.462
What is going on with you?

15:50.464 --> 15:53.599
Your whole life, you've always
finished what you've started.

15:53.601 --> 15:55.868
If not on time, two
weeks before it was due.

15:56.070 --> 15:58.971
You potty-trained yourself at 18 months.

15:58.973 --> 16:02.574
Well, diapers were humiliating.

16:02.576 --> 16:04.576
It was very hard being your sister.

16:04.578 --> 16:07.846
The only thing I ever did
early was grow breasts.

16:07.848 --> 16:09.348
I'm not sure those are done yet.

16:09.350 --> 16:11.583
This is different. This is my first book.

16:11.585 --> 16:13.485
This is a very big deal.

16:13.487 --> 16:16.522
If they don't like it, it's
over. My career is done.

16:16.524 --> 16:18.457
(sighs)

16:18.459 --> 16:21.493
As long as I was working on
that book, I was still a writer.

16:21.495 --> 16:23.662
But, sweetie,

16:23.664 --> 16:26.698
don't you also want to be a written-er?

16:27.533 --> 16:29.868
What?

16:35.041 --> 16:36.808
Harry?

16:36.810 --> 16:38.877
Hello!

16:38.879 --> 16:41.546
Mike. Mike, Mike, Mike.

16:41.548 --> 16:43.715
Harry is in our bedroom.

16:43.717 --> 16:46.251
Oh, hey, sweetie. We were just, uh...

16:46.253 --> 16:47.819
What were we doing?

16:47.821 --> 16:49.487
Hacking into her publisher's computer.

16:49.489 --> 16:50.722
What?

16:50.724 --> 16:52.157
I want to make this right.

16:52.159 --> 16:54.426
By hacking into his
computer? That's illegal.

16:54.428 --> 16:56.428
Can you actually do that?

16:56.430 --> 16:58.863
I'm already in. I've been
poking around his hard drive.

16:58.865 --> 17:01.700
This puppy is into some sick stuff.

17:01.702 --> 17:03.735
Threesomes, bondage, S and M.

17:03.737 --> 17:06.838
That's my book.

17:06.839 --> 17:09.674
Okay, well, just, uh, delete it.

17:09.675 --> 17:12.143
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

17:12.145 --> 17:14.078
Molly, you should only send your book in

17:14.079 --> 17:15.980
when you're completely happy with it.

17:15.982 --> 17:18.282
To be honest, I don't
know if I'm ever gonna be.

17:18.285 --> 17:20.551
Well, it's your book, your call.

17:20.554 --> 17:21.986
I don't know.

17:21.988 --> 17:24.189
I need an answer. We're
running out of time.

17:24.191 --> 17:25.323
Why? Is he logging in?

17:25.325 --> 17:28.425
No, I just want to go home.

17:28.428 --> 17:30.495
Mol, look, I know that it's scary,

17:30.497 --> 17:32.397
but sometimes you just
got to give up control

17:32.399 --> 17:34.132
and let what happens happen.

17:34.134 --> 17:35.500
Where'd you get that?

17:35.502 --> 17:38.002
That filthy, wonderful book you wrote.

17:38.004 --> 17:41.205
All right, Harry, leave it.

17:41.207 --> 17:43.207
We are clear.

17:43.209 --> 17:45.043
I'll just update your Adobe Flash...

17:45.045 --> 17:47.278
- Scram, Harry.
- You got it.

17:48.781 --> 17:50.815
Well, I did it, Mike.

17:50.817 --> 17:53.451
I turned in a book. It's done.

17:53.453 --> 17:55.620
- I'm a written-er.
- (Chuckles)

17:55.622 --> 17:58.556
I'm proud of you. Mwah.

17:58.558 --> 18:01.626
What do you say we celebrate with
a little seven minutes in heaven?

18:01.628 --> 18:03.794
Yeah, let's go.

18:05.030 --> 18:07.231
(giggling)

18:10.602 --> 18:12.370
MIKE: A little tight in here.

18:12.372 --> 18:14.472
MOLLY: It smells like mothballs.

18:14.474 --> 18:17.141
MIKE: How 'bout two minutes in heaven?

18:25.410 --> 18:27.078
Here you go. Don't get
up. I just wanted to...

18:27.080 --> 18:29.347
bring you some thank you
gifts for all of your notes.

18:29.349 --> 18:31.782
They opened my eyes to a whole new world

18:31.784 --> 18:34.385
I didn't want to know existed.

18:34.387 --> 18:36.253
You're very welcome, honey.

18:36.255 --> 18:39.090
I think I know what this is.

18:39.092 --> 18:40.724
Nope. Candlesticks.

18:40.726 --> 18:42.860
For decoration only.

18:44.329 --> 18:45.963
You didn't really need their notes.

18:45.965 --> 18:48.566
It was already a very good read.

18:48.568 --> 18:51.702
Now you're gonna be supportive?
Where was that with me?

18:51.704 --> 18:53.804
We got you a little something, too, doll.

18:53.806 --> 18:55.739
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

18:55.741 --> 18:57.841
- It's a picture from our Women's Club calendar.
- Aw.

18:57.843 --> 19:02.146
Oh... Oh, God. Where are your clothes?

19:02.148 --> 19:03.647
It was for charity.
