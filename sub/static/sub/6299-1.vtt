00:06.757 --> 00:08.964
{acoustic version of "Back to
the Future" theme playing]

00:30.197 --> 00:35.237
-[Dan Harmon] It's just such an
endlessly-entertaining myth,

00:35.536 --> 00:39.825
and it has a little bit
of modernized aesthetic to it.

00:40.123 --> 00:44.037
But it really is just satisfying on
the level of "Jack and the Beanstalk"

00:44.336 --> 00:46.828
or Ulysses fighting
a cyclops or something.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.088
It's just sort of a bunch of
neat shit to happen to a kid.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.356
-[Bob Gale]
Ray Bradbury once said that

01:08.652 --> 01:11.189
coming up with an idea is like
trying to behead the Medusa.

01:11.488 --> 01:14.025
If you face the problem straight-on,
you get turned to stone.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.530
You might just snag it.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.412
We never had any idea

01:24.668 --> 01:28.957
I nt OOIIhe-elÃ©i aats o n -

01:29.256 --> 01:31.213
Just-- It was
that magic something.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.000
- This is gonna sound like
hyperbole, and I don't mean it to.

01:34.303 --> 01:35.793
But it's almost a perfect movie.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.803
- It's a flawless film.
It's perfect.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.341
You can't change a thing... Can't
improve a thing on it. It's perfect.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.351
- It's a masterpiece.
There's really nothing like it.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.728
This tone that they did,

01:47.024 --> 01:49.311
the comedy,
the suspense, the drama...

01:49.610 --> 01:51.351
You just care
about the characters.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.441
It really is
kind of unparalleled.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.196
- It was beautifully cast.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.609
It was beautifully directed,
beautifully written.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.243
- The writing and the acting
was so good,

02:02.539 --> 02:05.031
and the editing was so good,
and the timing was so good.

02:05.334 --> 02:10.294
Every thread that Bob Gale laid down
to be picked up later got picked up.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.455
- They really cared
for that film so much,

02:12.758 --> 02:15.750
and it's just
so very, very well-written,

02:16.053 --> 02:17.714
well-produced, well-acted,

02:18.013 --> 02:20.300
and, of course,
they picked the right song.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.932
You got a DeLorean
for crying out loud,

02:27.230 --> 02:33.522
and you have these very defined,
quirky yet compelling characters.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.029
Stir it all together in the soup.
Look what you got.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.985
- It really is, for me,

02:39.284 --> 02:42.276
inarguably the greatest time-travel
movie ever put on film.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.994
For years and years,
since the '70s,

02:55.467 --> 02:59.176
We had tentatively titled it
"Professor Brown Visits the Future."

02:59.471 --> 03:00.802
And that was
pretty much all we had.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.556
- Who knows if they've got
cotton underwear in the future?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.636
I'm allergic to all synthetics.

03:05.936 --> 03:10.521
- We were never able to really come up with
anything every time we kicked it around

03:10.816 --> 03:15.151
until, uh, I was visiting my parents in St.
Louis, Missouri

03:15.445 --> 03:16.776
over the summer of 1980,

03:17.072 --> 03:19.359
came across my father's
high school yearbook.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.195
My father had gone to the same
high school that I'd went to,

03:22.494 --> 03:25.361
and I discovered he was the
president of his graduating class.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.280
And I had no idea of this,

03:27.582 --> 03:30.870
a n u re

03:31.169 --> 03:32.751
"President Mark Gale."

03:33.046 --> 03:35.287
And I'm thinking about the
president of my graduating class.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.376
He was kind of a jerk.

03:37.676 --> 03:43.171
And I thought to myself, "Gee, was my dad
one of these ra-ra, school spirit guys

03:43.473 --> 03:45.214
"that I couldn't stand?

03:45.517 --> 03:47.758
"If I had gone to high school with my
dad, would I have been friends with him?"

03:48.061 --> 03:50.302
- Which one is your pop?

03:50.605 --> 03:51.345
- That's him.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.145
- Okay. Okay, you 9W5-

03:55.444 --> 03:58.152
[laughing sarcastically]
Very funny.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.188
You guys are being real mature.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.651
- Maybe you were adopted.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.236
-[Gale] so when I came back
to California after that,

04:03.535 --> 04:05.367
I'm telling Bob about this,

04:05.662 --> 04:07.778
and he's loving it,
and he's thinking to himself,

04:08.081 --> 04:10.448
"Yeah." Says, "What if your morn
went to the same high school?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.412
"What if it turned out
she was, like, the school slut?"

04:12.711 --> 04:14.543
- Do you mind if I sit here?

04:14.838 --> 04:16.749
- No, fine. No, good.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.334
-[Gale] it just started
going, and going, and going.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.341
And pretty soon,
we had the germ of this idea

04:21.636 --> 04:23.343
about a kid
who goes back in time

04:23.638 --> 04:26.346
and ends up in high school
with his parents.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.678
- George, buddy,

04:28.977 --> 04:31.435
remember that girl
I introduced you to, Lorraine?

04:31.730 --> 04:35.314
-[Gale] We eventually worked
the thing up into a pitch.

04:35.609 --> 04:39.193
We were at Columbia Pictures, because we'd
just made a movie called "Used Cars."

04:39.488 --> 04:41.980
-["Stars and Stripes Forever"
playing]

04:43.909 --> 04:45.240
- Good morning!

04:45.535 --> 04:47.617
-[Steven Spielberg] I'd
produced their film "Used Cars"

04:47.913 --> 04:49.278
Over at Columbia with them.

04:49.581 --> 04:50.992
I really believed in them
so much.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.249
Bob Zemeckis brought me
a USC short film he had made

04:54.544 --> 04:56.876
just before I went off
to direct "Jaws" in 1974.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.378
It was called "Field of Honor."

04:58.673 --> 05:00.334
-[tense music playing]

05:00.634 --> 05:01.920
- Stop, or I'll shoot!

05:08.141 --> 05:09.506
-[Spielberg]
And I saw that movie,

05:09.810 --> 05:11.346
And I said, "Oh, my goodness,
this guy is a great filmmaker."

05:11.645 --> 05:15.263
[laughs] And I came back from "Jaws,"
came back from that experience,

05:15.565 --> 05:17.897
and we began hanging around,
and we were friends.

05:18.193 --> 05:22.687
Bob Gale, Bob Zemeckis, we used to go
shooting skeet and trap with John Milius.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.606
And we were sort of... It was Milius,
and me, and Gale, and Zemeckis,

05:25.909 --> 05:27.491
And that was the team
for a long time.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.619
-[Gale] Frank Price, the head of
the studio, loved "Used Cars."

05:30.914 --> 05:35.203
And he told us when we had our next idea,
please... he wanted to hear it first.

05:39.047 --> 05:42.381
And Columbia hired us
to write "Back to the Future."

05:42.676 --> 05:45.839
- They pitched me
"Back to the Future,"

05:46.137 --> 05:48.925
and I liked... I've always liked
science-fiction.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.306
So this was old home week.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.717
I grew up on science-fiction.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.637
- As a writer, you aspire
to write something like this.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.351
When you sit down,

05:58.650 --> 06:00.266
you want everything to be the
"Back to the Future" screenplay.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.778
You want everything set up
perfectly paid off.

06:04.072 --> 06:08.191
You want every character to be complex,
three-dimensional, compelling.

06:08.493 --> 06:12.077
<i>Ajo-AEE </i> I

06:12.372 --> 06:15.615
But even... It's...

06:15.917 --> 06:18.033
You probably have one of
those in you in a lifetime.

06:18.336 --> 06:21.545
-[Frank Price] Columbia had been
extremely successful

06:21.840 --> 06:24.332
between 1978, when I went there,

06:24.634 --> 06:27.342
and this is now 1982.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.719
"Blue Lagoon" turned out
a huge hit.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.929
"Kramer" was a huge hit.
We had "Tootsie," "Karate Kid."

06:34.227 --> 06:36.889
So Coca-Cola bought Columbia,

06:37.188 --> 06:40.431
and that was a huge revolution.

06:40.734 --> 06:46.104
And there were some problems of
fit, though, once Coke was there,

06:46.406 --> 06:50.866
because Coke prided itself
on its marketing.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.448
And I thought we did
very good marketing.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.704
They started interfering
with our marketing.

06:55.999 --> 06:59.412
We couldn't get an agreement on
how to run the movie operation,

06:59.711 --> 07:03.249
So that's when I left behind
a lot of projects.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.916
-" Back to the Future" breaks
as many rules as it follows.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.299
I mean, it...

07:08.595 --> 07:12.179
Marty McFly is
a flawless protagonist.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.511
He doesn't learn a damn thing.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.801
He has no unconscious wish
that he needs to fulfill

07:23.443 --> 07:25.775
Which is a selfish, dumb thing
to wish for.

07:26.071 --> 07:29.530
And it's not like he learns
a lesson through any of it.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.816
He's just this willing hero that
charges across this threshold

07:33.119 --> 07:35.030
and mucks things up
a little bit.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.616
He's really nervous
that his mom is gonna,

07:36.915 --> 07:39.577
you know, give him
a HJ in the parking lot.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.243
- Oh, you mean like how you're
supposed to act on a first date.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.956
-[Harmon]
It's so richly satisfying

07:44.255 --> 07:48.169
for a movie where the guy that
you're in the shoes of doesn%...

07:48.468 --> 07:49.924
he doesn't have an arc.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.757
And that's one of many things
about that movie that's like,

07:53.056 --> 07:56.469
oh, this, strictly speaking, according to
Robert McKee or a screenwriting class,

07:56.768 --> 07:59.681
it shouldn't be
as satisfying as it is.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.562
- I mean, it's definitely not
a perfect movie.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.438
There might even be
one or two shots in it

08:03.733 --> 08:05.599
that are a little bit,
a hair out of focus.

08:05.902 --> 08:06.937
You know,
so it's not a perfect movie.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.819
But the screenplay
is really good.

08:09.114 --> 08:14.029
I mean, that's really something that
they should study in film school.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.536
-[Lea Thompson] I know people who
have been to USC film school,

08:17.831 --> 08:20.243
and certain teachers use the
script of "Back to the Future"

08:20.542 --> 08:21.498
as the perfect script.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.785
- It rides this

08:25.088 --> 08:30.174
razor's edge between an absurd
amount of exposition...

08:30.468 --> 08:31.958
- Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.253
I'm standing in a parking lot
at Twin Pines Mall.

08:34.556 --> 08:38.015
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.

08:38.308 --> 08:39.595
And this is
temporal experiment number one.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.135
-...and total immersification.

08:43.982 --> 08:49.648
It's just bursting at the seams
with pipe.

08:49.946 --> 08:54.406
- The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.907
- Where the hell are they?

08:56.202 --> 08:58.864
- The appropriate question is
when the hell are they?

08:59.164 --> 09:05.251
- You're being told so many facts
for the first quarter of that movie

09:05.545 --> 09:08.663
simply so that the Sudoku
can complete itself.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.171
- This readout tells you
where you're going.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.377
This one tells you
where you are.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.791
This one tells you
where you were.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.882
- And that's
a rule being broken.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.551
It's not supposed to, uh, be
fair to do that to an audience.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.810
- I'm gonna make you
flying-saucer shaped pancakes.

09:24.105 --> 09:27.348
- Oh, there's no need to do that, Beth.
Regular pancakes are fine.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.567
"Ch, my god!
What is happening?

09:37.077 --> 09:40.160
-[Harmon]
"Rick and Morty" was

09:40.455 --> 09:46.041
Justin Roiland's frustrated,
punk rock tantrum

09:46.336 --> 09:50.421
that he was throwing after finishing
working on someone else's show.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.376
He was spending a year

09:52.675 --> 09:57.511
having no control over the content
he was expected to invest in.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.218
And he came off of that job,
and he just made,

10:00.517 --> 10:04.260
in his opinion, the most kind of
sacrilegious thing he could do.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.020
For him, the equivalent
of Mickey Mouse [beep] Pluto.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.103
But who cares about Mickey Mouse
and Pluto in this generation?

10:10.401 --> 10:16.693
I don't know if the writers know more than
they're telling... than is clear in the movie

10:16.991 --> 10:23.237
about how this teenage guitarist ended up
hanging out with this bankrupt scientist.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.451
- Today, if we tried
to make that movie,

10:25.750 --> 10:28.742
people would start wondering, "Gee, is Doc
Brown, like, a child molester or something?"

10:29.045 --> 10:33.380
But back in the day,
nobody ever thought about that.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.087
-[Spielberg] The infectious
character of Marty McFly,

10:36.386 --> 10:39.048
and his positivity,
and his high spirits.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.508
The crazy Doc Brown.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.845
That two-hander
between McFly and Brown,

10:44.144 --> 10:45.885
That's like Laurel and Hardy.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.269
That's like Abbott and Costello.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.852
I mean, those guys
will go down in history

10:51.151 --> 10:54.109
as the best two for one
since Hope and Crosby.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.360
So Zemeckis and Gale really
found lightning in a bottle.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.072
Yo u f? ifart' u n c:I

11:06.291 --> 11:09.033
-[Gale] We took it around
to every studio in town,

11:09.335 --> 11:13.329
and they would all say, "It's very nice.
It's very sweet.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.042
"Why don't you guys
take it to Disney?"

11:15.341 --> 11:16.923
We also would hear,

11:17.218 --> 11:19.255
"It's a time-travel movie, and time-travel
movies don't make any money."

11:19.554 --> 11:22.922
- Everybody said, "Oh, you can't
make time-travel movies.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.760
"People don't go see them."

11:25.059 --> 11:29.644
Well, you just don't make bad time-travel
movies. You make a good one.

11:29.939 --> 11:33.523
- So finally, after we
heard that about 15 or 20 times,

11:33.818 --> 11:37.356
Bob and I kind of shrugged, said, "Well,
what the hell? Let's take it to Disney."

11:37.655 --> 11:39.145
So we submitted it to Disney.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.655
We took a meeting over there.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.284
And the exec at Disney,
we walk into his office,

11:44.579 --> 11:46.786
and he looks at us
like we're completely insane.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.072
He says, "Are you guys nuts?

11:49.375 --> 11:52.208
"We can't make this movie here.
We're Disney,

11:52.503 --> 11:54.665
"and you guys have
written a movie about incest."

11:54.964 --> 11:58.173
So, it was nice and sweet for
everybody else except Disney,

11:58.468 --> 12:00.050
and for them, it was taboo.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.928
- Marty, I'm almost 18 years old.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.759
It's not like
I've never parked before.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.265
- What?

12:07.560 --> 12:08.766
- Fl'hompson] Lorraine McFly is
essentially in love with her own son,

12:09.062 --> 12:11.224
which I thought was hilarious.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.685
And I always have had a kind
of subversive sense of humor.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.442
So I definitely got it
when I got the part.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.354
But I really loved
the crazy aspect of that.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.695
She was just like... [purrs] I mean, I
played her like a kitty cat in heat.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.734
And I still think it's funny
that people think

12:26.037 --> 12:29.871
I'm, like, so white bread,
and sweet, and cute

12:30.166 --> 12:33.454
when I'm really known for a part
where I wanted to sleep with my son.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.421
- You know what I do
in those situations?

12:37.715 --> 12:38.750
- What?

12:39.050 --> 12:39.960
- I don't worry.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.668
-[Gale] Steven Spielberg
always liked it.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.259
But we'd made three pictures
with Steven,

12:46.557 --> 12:48.548
and none had made
any money at the box office.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.139
So we were afraid if we did another
picture with Steven, and it tanked,

12:52.438 --> 12:54.054
we'd never work again.

12:54.357 --> 12:57.099
And Bob said, "I gotta get
a movie made that's mine,

13:03.700 --> 13:07.443
And after all the frustration of not
getting "Back to the Future" made,

13:07.745 --> 13:11.534
Bob finally said, "I'm gonna take the next
decent script that gets submitted to rne."

13:13.126 --> 13:14.958
-[Spielberg] After I'd produced
their first two movies,

13:20.883 --> 13:23.250
- Back off me, creep.
Just back off.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.544
- Oh. Oh, I'm the creep, huh?

13:25.847 --> 13:28.714
Well, at least I'm honest.
I'm stealing this stone.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.054
I'm not trying to
romance it out from under her.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.434
- Out of nowhere,
this phone call comes

13:33.730 --> 13:39.316
from the music editor, Torn Carlin,
who I had worked with on "C.H.I.P.S."

13:39.610 --> 13:43.820
And he's doing this movie
called "Romancing the Stone"

13:44.115 --> 13:47.028
with this guy named
Robert Zemeckis.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.694
Introduced us on the phone.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.578
Bob described this scene,

13:51.873 --> 13:56.162
a guy and a girl running through the
jungle. Raining, machetes, federali.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.327
"Can you do, like,
three minutes of that

13:58.629 --> 14:01.371
"and come in around 9:30
tomorrow morning"

14:01.674 --> 14:05.713
I put a little, quickie,
demo mock-up together,

14:06.012 --> 14:08.049
went in, got the job.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.682
-[Gale] It's a big, big hit.
Everybody wants his next picture.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.513
The movie he wants to make the
most is "Back to the Future."

14:14.812 --> 14:19.101
And he decides rather than make it with
any of his new, fair-weather friends,

14:19.400 --> 14:22.358
who now wanna be in business
with him because he made a hit,

14:22.653 --> 14:26.362
we should go back to the guy
who believed in it originally,

14:26.657 --> 14:28.273
which was Steven.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.783
- They came back, and they brought me
the script called "Back to the Future."

14:31.079 --> 14:33.616
And they said, you know,

14:33.915 --> 14:35.371
"We'd like you
to be involved in this.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.203
"We think it's something
we really wanna do."

14:38.503 --> 14:40.665
And I read it and loved it.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.547
I mean, I couldn't believe what an
accomplished and fun piece of writing it was.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.958
And it was different than anything
I'd ever seen in a movie theater.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.093
The stow was off-the-wall,

14:49.389 --> 14:52.051
and out-of-sight, and out-of-the-box,
and all those other terms.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.307
And so, I brought it
to Sid Sheinberg,

14:54.602 --> 14:57.811
and Sid loved it too and gave us the
financing to go off and make it.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.188
- So we got it set up
at Universal.

15:00.483 --> 15:05.444
And lo and behold, the guy who was in charge
of the studio at Universal was Frank Price,

15:05.738 --> 15:08.400
who originally brought us on
to write it.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.407
- Guy McElwaine,
who had worked for me,

15:11.702 --> 15:13.818
who was now running Columbia,

15:14.122 --> 15:17.831
I mentioned to him that
a project he had with Peter Falk

15:18.126 --> 15:20.493
seemed a lot
like "Double indemnity."

15:20.795 --> 15:22.832
And he was committed
to making it.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.498
Guy had his lawyers check it,

15:25.800 --> 15:28.542
read the script
and make comparisons.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.928
And I got
an urgent call from him,

15:32.223 --> 15:35.466
saying, "My god, you're right.
It's 'Double Indemnity,'

15:35.768 --> 15:37.258
"and I'm committed."

15:37.562 --> 15:42.807
As it turned out, Universal owned
the rights to "Double indemnity."

15:43.109 --> 15:45.646
I came up with two projects

15:45.945 --> 15:50.815
that, as I put it, I'd had them in
development, couldn't get them quite right,

15:51.117 --> 15:54.280
but I know I'd like to
work on them more.

15:54.579 --> 15:58.698
And one is the other project, and the
other one is "Back to the Future."

15:59.000 --> 16:03.961
I knew Guy. He would have been suspicious
if it was just "Back to the Future."

16:04.255 --> 16:05.586
He agreed to the deal.

16:05.882 --> 16:09.170
And I gave him the license
for "Double indemnity,"

16:09.469 --> 16:12.302
and he gave me the two properties,
one of which I didn't want,

16:12.597 --> 16:14.304
but I got the one I wanted.

16:14.599 --> 16:18.058
- I originally was in a film
in the early '80s

16:18.352 --> 16:21.219
called "Scared Straight! Another
Story," which was a CBS film.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.058
-[laughing]
- What? That's funny?

16:23.357 --> 16:24.563
Seeing James wreck up his hand?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.520
- Hey, he's demented.

16:26.819 --> 16:31.313
- And the casting director
was so impressed with my work

16:31.616 --> 16:34.028
that they were casting
"Back to the Future,"

16:34.327 --> 16:37.695
so they set up a meeting
for me to meet Bob Zemeckis.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.704
-[Christopher Lloyd] I was
making a film in Mexico City,

16:39.999 --> 16:44.835
and my agent, Bob Durst, sent me the
script for "Back to the Future."

16:45.129 --> 16:46.585
I wasn't thrilled at it.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.210
Which I was enthusiastic about.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.096
Things weren't going that great,

16:57.391 --> 17:01.134
and I thought
I should get back to my roots.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.678
- I always thought
I might wanna go to Hollywood.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.814
But I said I'm never going to
Hollywood till they send for me.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.863
I got a script
from Robert Zemeckis,

17:17.161 --> 17:18.367
And it was "Back to the Future."

17:18.663 --> 17:20.574
And I say, "Okay, well,
maybe this is my chance

17:20.873 --> 17:23.455
"to go out to Hollywood
and see what's going on."

17:26.503 --> 17:28.369
- You're a slacker, McFly.

17:28.673 --> 17:32.632
- I always told myself I'd
always leave no stone unturned,

17:32.927 --> 17:36.465
so I took another look
at the script,

17:36.764 --> 17:40.598
went back, met Bob Zemeckis,
and that was that.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.600
{Claudia Wells] It was very
hard for me to get commercials.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.805
'Cause they always
used to tell me

17:44.105 --> 17:45.266
that I would distract
from the product.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.897
I had a callback
later that day for a commercial,

17:48.192 --> 17:51.275
and I was more excited about the callback for
the commercial 'cause it was so unusual.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.653
- For some reason, I just
really got the characters.

17:53.948 --> 17:57.066
You just never know. Sometimes, characters
just come to you really clearly.

17:57.368 --> 17:58.699
- It's terrible.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.451
Girls these days,

18:00.746 --> 18:03.613
smoking pot, drinking booze.
[scoffs]

18:05.084 --> 18:06.540
It's terrible.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.372
- Look up. Don't put your head down.
- Don't put my head down?

18:08.671 --> 18:10.287
- Look more straight above the lens
here, so you're not looking down.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.207
- C)h, I see. -'Cause the
hair might shadow your face.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.465
-[Fullilove]
I went and met with Bob,

18:14.760 --> 18:15.750
and he asked me
a bunch of questions.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.714
You know, I never auditioned
or read anything.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.504
He was just asking me questions,

18:19.807 --> 18:22.925
and next thing you know,
I'm Goldie Wilson.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.843
- And one day,
I'm gonna be somebody.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.853
- That's right.
He's gonna be mayor.

18:27.148 --> 18:27.979
- Yeah, I'm gonna...

18:29.525 --> 18:30.560
Mayor!

18:30.860 --> 18:32.567
- Oh. [laughs]

18:34.155 --> 18:36.237
If I had a penny

18:36.532 --> 18:39.615
for every time
I was asked to say,

18:41.078 --> 18:43.115
<i>ll ll</i>

18:45.207 --> 18:46.288
Yeah.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.996
Hey, you know what?
It made me almost famous.

18:53.424 --> 18:54.960
{Thompson} Movies are magic.

18:55.259 --> 18:58.297
You can write a great script, and
cast just a couple people wrong,

18:58.596 --> 19:00.587
or one person wrong, and the
whole thing will fall apart.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.551
And, you know,
that kind of was the case.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.887
I was lucky enough to be in
movie called "The Wild Life,"

19:05.186 --> 19:07.598
and they were thinking about Eric
Stoltz, who was my boyfriend.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.183
- You're the one
who needed your freedom.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.597
- Well, I didn't know
that was an excuse

19:10.900 --> 19:12.561
for you to start going out
with the entire male race.

19:12.860 --> 19:16.398
- I made a decision
that was based on, um,

19:16.697 --> 19:19.109
you know, just the desire
to get the movie made.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.274
And I was given an ultimatum
by the head of the studio

19:21.577 --> 19:24.615
that if I didn't start the movie on a
specific day, they weren't gonna make it.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.121
-[Zemeckis] My first choice
for the part was unavailable

19:27.416 --> 19:28.872
because he was in a TV show.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.626
So Eric is a really good actor,

19:31.921 --> 19:33.958
and I made the decision
to put him in the movie,

19:34.256 --> 19:37.123
but it turned out that
his instincts

19:37.426 --> 19:43.172
and the type of comedy that we
were doing wasn't really gelling.

19:43.474 --> 19:48.810
- It became clear
as the picture progressed

19:49.105 --> 19:53.565
that the humor just wasn't
working the way it should.

19:53.859 --> 19:58.103
It is something
to recast at that point.

19:58.406 --> 20:03.492
This was a terrific picture,
should be,

20:03.786 --> 20:05.993
and it wasn't coming alive.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.201
{Christopher Lloyd] When we broke
for dinner at, like, 1 :00 a.m.,

20:09.500 --> 20:11.457
all the suits were there
and everything.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.837
Bob Zemeckis made
an announcement.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.839
It was very sad, you know.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.753
God, if I was an actor for six
weeks on something, and I got...

20:24.598 --> 20:26.965
You don't recover from that.

20:27.268 --> 20:28.383
-L, um...

20:30.104 --> 20:32.266
didn't wanna believe
that it wasn't working,

20:32.565 --> 20:34.306
so that's why
I kept shooting and shooting.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.098
I was kind of
in denial about it.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.734
And I had to ultimately
accept the truth.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.986
It was very painful
for everybody.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.068
- They started to shoot
the movie without me,

20:43.367 --> 20:45.028
and I didn't know
anything went on.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.739
And then Gary called me into
his office one day and said

20:48.038 --> 20:50.621
that they had
approached me originally,

20:50.916 --> 20:53.374
and then they'd shot, and they
weren't happy with what they had,

20:53.669 --> 20:55.455
and would I consider
doing it now?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.245
He thought I could do it.

20:57.548 --> 21:01.462
As long as I did the show in the
daytime, and the movie at night.

21:01.761 --> 21:05.504
- The minute Michael J. Fox
was in it,

21:07.892 --> 21:10.634
it was clear a very good
decision had been made,

21:10.936 --> 21:12.722
because it all
started working then.

21:13.022 --> 21:16.890
-[Gale] Listen, I'll tell you everybody
would love to see the Eric Stoltz footage

21:17.193 --> 21:19.184
that we did not destroy.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.398
Someday,
that footage will be released.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.815
So we can look forward to that.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.357
No promises as to when.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.697
- They were really welcoming to me.
They were really great.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.658
I mean, there was
some concern...

21:31.957 --> 21:34.540
There were
practical realities...

21:34.835 --> 21:37.167
There were scenes
where my coverage was shot,

21:37.463 --> 21:40.706
where the other actors
are reacting to Eric.

21:41.008 --> 21:44.000
They'd shot the stuff already,

21:44.303 --> 21:46.169
and so they went and inserted
my coverage into it.

21:46.472 --> 21:49.885
So it's really strange.
I mean, it's...

21:50.184 --> 21:55.975
We would do days of shooting just one piece
of coverage from previously-filmed sequences.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.139
So, that was kind of strange.

21:58.442 --> 22:03.482
But then very quickly, it became
just the way it was supposed to be.

22:03.781 --> 22:08.776
And I don't mean that in any
derogatory sense towards Eric.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.570
Just in the sense that we hit a rhythm
that they were comfortable with,

22:11.872 --> 22:13.328
that was what they had in mind.

22:13.624 --> 22:17.208
I would wake up at 10:00 in the
morning, and go to "Family Ties,"

22:17.503 --> 22:18.959
and work until 6:00.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.622
Then they'd pick me up after work
and take me out to Universal,

22:21.924 --> 22:23.790
and I'd work there until like
2:00, 3:00 in the morning,

22:24.093 --> 22:26.334
and then I'd go back
and crawl into bed.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.841
It would get
to the point literally

22:30.140 --> 22:32.177
where a teamster was coming, turning
on the shower, waking me up,

22:32.476 --> 22:34.217
and hustling me
toward the shower,

22:34.520 --> 22:36.261
and getting me in the car,

22:36.564 --> 22:40.102
and I'd catch a nap
on the way into work.

22:40.401 --> 22:43.860
It was pretty incredible,
but it was, um...

22:44.154 --> 22:46.566
You really felt like you were doing
something oool. It was really energizing.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.904
-[" Power of Love" playing]

23:06.093 --> 23:07.583
- Okay, thank you.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.798
Thank you. Thank you very much.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.383
Hold it, fellas.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.764
I'm afraid you're just
too darn loud.

23:14.059 --> 23:19.145
- I remember we were contacted by
Steven Spielberg, I think, first.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.683
And we took a meeting,
my manager Bob Brown and I,

23:22.985 --> 23:25.818
With the two Bobs and Steven.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.696
And they said
they'd just written this film,

23:28.991 --> 23:35.033
and this character, Marty McFly, his favorite
band would be Huey Lewis and the News.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.868
So, "How would you like
to write a song for the film?"

23:38.167 --> 23:43.003
I told them I was flattered, but I didn't
know how to write for film necessarily,

23:43.297 --> 23:47.757
and I wasn't too chuffed with the idea of
writing a song called "Back to the Future."

23:48.052 --> 23:49.759
And they said,
"Oh, don't worry about it.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.421
"You don't have to oall it 'Back to the
Future.' Call it whatever you want."

23:52.723 --> 23:54.384
And I said, "Well, cool."

23:54.683 --> 23:58.426
I said, "I'll tell you what. We'll just
go off and try and write something,

23:58.729 --> 24:02.063
"and we'll send you the first thing
we write, send it down to you?"

24:02.358 --> 24:04.099
I know it's been a few years.

24:04.401 --> 24:05.983
I know it's been a few years.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.144
But Hollywood finally called.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.946
That's it. Your favorite group
is in the movie business.

24:20.793 --> 24:21.783
- What's going on in there?

24:22.086 --> 24:23.076
- Music.
- What kind of music?

24:23.379 --> 24:24.995
- Dancing.
- Rock and roll.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.002
_l-lu6Y-

24:26.298 --> 24:27.709
- This is the place!

24:28.008 --> 24:31.000
- And almost the first thing
we wrote was "Power of..."

24:31.303 --> 24:33.089
I remember it as being
the first thing we wrote.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.096
Bob, I think,
remembers it differently.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.678
But either the first
or second thing we wrote,

24:37.977 --> 24:38.842
sent it down
was "Power of Love."

24:39.144 --> 24:41.101
-[" Power of Love" playing]

24:51.699 --> 24:54.031
-[Huey Lewis] I really didn't think it
was gonna work in the film so much.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.112
'Cause it's tangential.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.905
You know, "Power of Love," what does
that have to do with the plot at all?

25:00.207 --> 25:02.949
<i>I</i> The power of love
is a curious thing âª

25:03.252 --> 25:05.994
But it turns out, that works
better in a way, you know,

25:06.296 --> 25:08.958
than a song written
specifically for the film.

25:09.258 --> 25:14.173
Bob Zemeckis credits us
with the greatest rollout ever,

25:14.471 --> 25:17.213
they released the song,
before this movie came out.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.257
Because it took that long
to build the song.

25:19.560 --> 25:23.269
So I think the week
that the film was released,

25:23.564 --> 25:25.225
"Power of Love" was on top.

25:25.524 --> 25:29.438
So that was a real help
for the film in this country.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.728
But then when the film
became such a smash,

25:32.031 --> 25:33.396
and then it went international,

25:33.699 --> 25:36.111
the film drove
the song internationally.

25:36.410 --> 25:40.620
And so, from then on, it really opened up
all kinds of doors for us internationally.

25:40.914 --> 25:43.201
-[" Power of Love" playing]

25:47.713 --> 25:50.705
-.P The power of love
is a curious thing âª

25:51.008 --> 25:52.999
-[Man] we wanted
to take people back in time,

25:53.302 --> 25:56.215
and music is really the ultimate
way to do that in our opinion.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.174
Music is a time machine itself,

25:58.474 --> 26:03.810
so we get to really, like, exploit
the whole time-travel funcfion

26:04.104 --> 26:05.811
of what it is that we do.

26:09.526 --> 26:13.770
Is because we really hit that emotional
chord with people, you know.

26:14.073 --> 26:18.192
And that's one of the common themes
I see throughout our shows is,

26:18.494 --> 26:20.360
you know, We hit that emotion.

26:20.662 --> 26:23.279
And having that reference
with "Back to the Future,"

26:23.582 --> 26:25.619
"Back to the Future,"
that gets that out of everybody.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.961
-[Man 3]
After a little time went by,

26:35.260 --> 26:37.251
we started getting into
the cosplay circuit

26:37.554 --> 26:42.549
For Comic Cons, and Comikaze, and all
the conventions that are going around.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.717
We don't consider ourselves
cosplayers by any means,

26:45.020 --> 26:47.261
but it's cool to be
a part of that world.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.020
-[Man 1] We did it
for the love of the film.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.933
We didn't do it because we know
there was a world out there

26:52.236 --> 26:55.570
with DeLoreans
and time machines.

26:55.864 --> 26:59.402
We weren't aware of how big the
"Back to the Future" universe was.

26:59.701 --> 27:04.446
So really quickly, we started
bumping into time machine owners.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.206
And then Don Fullilove
came to one of our shows,

27:07.501 --> 27:09.117
and he was digging it,
Mayor Goldie Wilson.

27:09.419 --> 27:12.161
And then we started
doing things with Claudia Wells.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.501
- Last night,
we had a rehearsal,

27:14.800 --> 27:17.792
and Mayor Goldie Wilson
stopped by with beef jerky

27:18.095 --> 27:21.884
and just gave us beef jerky that
he picked up from a road trip,

27:22.182 --> 27:24.173
And hung out,
listened to a couple songs.

27:24.476 --> 27:29.516
And it's just like that's so cool
just to have those opportunities.

27:29.815 --> 27:33.353
-[Man 1] Since what we play and
what we represent means so much

27:33.652 --> 27:35.768
to just the public in general,

27:37.865 --> 27:39.321
we can do this
for years to come.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.857
And that's one of the things
that we look forward to

27:42.161 --> 27:44.152
is sort of going
around the world

27:44.454 --> 27:46.616
and bringing people
back in time.

27:51.628 --> 27:57.044
- I do remember the first preview
of "Back to the Future."

27:57.342 --> 28:00.130
We all got on a plane
and went up to San Jose.

28:00.429 --> 28:03.171
And those
are usually terrifying,

28:03.473 --> 28:08.013
because it's the first time you're
gonna show the film to an audience,

28:08.312 --> 28:12.351
and you really don't know
what's gonna happen.

28:12.649 --> 28:13.935
-[Man] MTV was just getting
off the ground,

28:14.234 --> 28:16.771
and the VJs, and all that
good stuff, Torn Petty.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.777
I mean, it was just crazy.

28:19.072 --> 28:22.940
And they were talking about win these
tickets to a movie, blah, blah, blah.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.531
So I submitted my name.
I never win anything, you know.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.822
And I won the tickets,
not really knowing...

28:30.125 --> 28:31.911
You know, there was no Internet.

28:32.211 --> 28:36.375
There was maybe smoke signals telling you,
"Hey, great movie!" No Twitter, nothing.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.789
So we were sitting there, and there
were these crowds of people.

28:39.092 --> 28:42.460
And there's no pictures, nothing
telling you what this movie is about.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.846
- I'll never forget. The lights
came down in this theater.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.973
We were all sitting
way in the back.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.226
And on the screen,

28:51.521 --> 28:54.730
It says,
"Steven Spielberg presents."

28:55.025 --> 28:57.608
The place went crazy.

28:57.903 --> 29:00.144
And then it said,
"A Robert Zemeckis film."

29:00.447 --> 29:02.484
They went crazy.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.399
- I was just like this...

29:04.701 --> 29:08.660
throughout the whole film. Just like
totally just loving every aspect.

29:08.956 --> 29:13.120
- I saw that, I think,
with "Star Wars."

29:13.418 --> 29:16.035
I saw that with "Ghostbusters."

29:16.338 --> 29:19.547
There's no accounting for it.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.378
- After seeing the film,
I wanted to buy a DeLorean.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.715
I mean, I bet you everybody did.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.254
Well, obviously,
at 18 years old,

29:27.557 --> 29:29.264
with a couple of waiter jobs,
parking cars,

29:29.559 --> 29:30.594
I'm not gonna buy a DeLorean.

29:32.521 --> 29:36.014
It was one of those
bucket list things in life.

29:36.316 --> 29:39.650
It's almost like some people want a Rolex
watch when they turned a certain age

29:39.945 --> 29:41.185
because it's a sign of success.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.775
Well, you know what? I wanted
a DeLorean time machine.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.109
That's not too much to ask.

29:45.409 --> 29:46.114
And I did it.

30:05.095 --> 30:08.963
-[Gale] In the first two drafts, the
time machine was not a DeLorean at all.

30:09.266 --> 30:11.223
It was not in a car.
It was not mobile.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.852
It was a time ray
that shot into a time chamber.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.979
And in the climax

30:17.274 --> 30:20.767
that took place at a nuclear test
site in those early versions,

30:21.069 --> 30:25.028
the time chamber, Doc converted a
refrigerator and put lead lining in it.

30:25.324 --> 30:28.487
And Marty was protected
from the nuclear blast

30:28.785 --> 30:32.153
by being inside of a time chamber
made of an old refrigerator.

30:32.456 --> 30:35.574
-[Warning system]
Four, three,

30:35.876 --> 30:39.414
two, one, zero.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.454
- The original ending
for the first movie

30:41.757 --> 30:44.590
turned out to be "lndiana Jones and
The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."

30:44.885 --> 30:46.296
I don't know
if you're familiar with this,

30:46.595 --> 30:48.177
but the idea,
the nuke the fridge thing,

30:48.472 --> 30:51.180
actually came out of an early
draft of the first movie.

30:51.475 --> 30:52.556
I didn't know that.

30:53.810 --> 30:54.891
That was a pretty big moment
for me

30:55.187 --> 30:56.723
when I was reading the script
and said,

30:57.022 --> 30:59.138
"Hey, wait a minute.
I've seen this before,

30:59.441 --> 31:00.852
"and I didn't like it."

31:01.151 --> 31:02.391
- We started thinking about this
and thought,

31:02.694 --> 31:04.810
"Well, if you really were gonna
build a time machine,

31:05.113 --> 31:07.104
"you would build it
in a vehicle,

31:07.407 --> 31:09.569
"because you'd have to be able
to get around."

31:09.868 --> 31:11.825
We came up with the idea
of the DeLorean

31:12.120 --> 31:15.704
simply because it had gull-wing
doors, and we had this joke...

31:15.999 --> 31:18.741
- That ain't no airplane. Look.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.627
-[Zemeckis] In the '50s, when
the kid is in the farmhouse,

31:21.922 --> 31:25.131
And they go in the barn, and he
thinks it's a Martian that landed.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.166
So we thought what kind of a
car looks like a spaceship?

31:27.469 --> 31:29.130
Well, a DeLorean
'cause of the gull-wing doors.

31:31.014 --> 31:34.223
-[Andrew Probert] Ron comes
aboard, a really amazing guy.

31:34.518 --> 31:37.385
Gets to work, and designs
an initial version of the car,

31:37.687 --> 31:40.679
and then leaves
to go do another show.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.518
The producers looked at it
and said,

31:42.818 --> 31:44.775
"You know,
we like what Ron's done,

31:45.070 --> 31:46.401
"but can you take it
another step further?"

31:47.697 --> 31:49.938
So, I was able to get in there

31:50.242 --> 31:54.611
and take his basic car, and add a bunch
of stuff to it, rearrange some things,

31:54.913 --> 31:56.995
and come up
with a final version.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.783
- I had worked on a TV show
that had been pretty successful.

32:01.086 --> 32:05.296
I had made a car... kind of a
talking car for a TV show.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.831
- Welcome aboard
the Knight Two Thousand.

32:08.135 --> 32:10.422
- Thank you.
What's all this?

32:10.720 --> 32:12.302
Looks like
Darth Vader's bathroom.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.463
-[Michael Scheffe] "Knight Rider" was
one of the biggest-budget things

32:14.766 --> 32:16.006
that I'd worked on.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.892
And what I would sketch was
something I knew I could build,

32:19.187 --> 32:20.973
or I knew someone could build.

32:21.273 --> 32:24.516
- If you're gonna build a time machine
into a car, why not do it with some style?

32:24.818 --> 32:27.105
- I mean, the whole story
of John DeLorean

32:27.404 --> 32:31.363
is sort of a classic, American
folklore story unto itself,

32:31.658 --> 32:36.027
so I think that ties in to the whole
Doc Brown being an American inventor.

32:36.329 --> 32:41.324
It's also unique in the fact that it's
the only car that the company produced.

32:41.626 --> 32:45.085
If they would have lasted longer
and produced other models oars,

32:45.380 --> 32:48.839
maybe even the bus,
maybe even the snowplow,

32:49.134 --> 32:51.922
you would see a lot more of them out here
today, and it wouldn't be so special.

32:52.220 --> 32:56.589
-[Bill Shea] If the DeLorean was still around
today, even though it was in the movie,

32:56.892 --> 32:59.475
I truly feel that
it would not be as iconic,

32:59.769 --> 33:02.887
because people would say,
"It's just another car."

33:03.190 --> 33:07.980
So the fact that it failed
made it successful.

33:08.278 --> 33:13.739
The fact that it failed made it a piece
of movie history and American history.

33:14.034 --> 33:15.445
-[Ron Ferguson]
Out of 9,000 made,

33:15.744 --> 33:18.736
it's now, what, 33 years
since the last car was produced,

33:19.039 --> 33:21.781
and over 6,500 are
probably still around.

33:22.083 --> 33:25.075
I mean, the day after the
last Pinto came off the line,

33:25.378 --> 33:26.960
you didn't see
any of those anymore.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.997
- I thought they built that car
just for the movie.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.291
I didn't know.
I wasn't a car guy.

33:32.594 --> 33:35.586
Years later, I found out it was
a real car, and I was like...

33:35.889 --> 33:40.429
"One of these days,
I'm gonna get one of those cars,

33:40.727 --> 33:43.264
"and I'm gonna turn it
into a time machine."

33:43.563 --> 33:46.931
- I've been thinking very
seriously about getting one.

33:47.234 --> 33:49.100
I've ridden
in quite a few of them.

33:56.409 --> 33:57.695
-[Man] There we go. There We go.

33:57.994 --> 33:59.359
-[Fullilove] Oh, yeah.
-[Man] I got DeLorean.

33:59.663 --> 34:02.280
And it's an eagle.
That's an eagle.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.993
- An eagle?
- That's an eagle.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.454
- His excitement is not
that exciting to me.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.835
-[Man] My yard is all dirt, like sand.
Nothing would grow there.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.996
I tried every grass
when I first bought the place

34:11.299 --> 34:12.039
and it wouldn't work.

34:12.342 --> 34:13.581
So I was like,
"I'll put a deck in."

34:13.885 --> 34:15.670
I'm from Ohio. We just make decks.
It's just what we do.

34:15.971 --> 34:18.087
And then I thought, "Hey, I've always
wanted a little putting green."

34:18.389 --> 34:21.553
So I just laid down some cement,
got the Astroturf, you know.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.684
And I was like, "well, I'll
just make another tee box."

34:24.980 --> 34:27.187
And I was done at, like, three
holes, and I let it go.

34:27.482 --> 34:31.440
And then I had to make another deck, and
then I went, "Well, we'll make it six."

34:31.735 --> 34:34.524
You know what happens. You just
eventually go, "I gotta have nine holes."

34:34.822 --> 34:37.030
I got some charities
involved in some events,

34:37.324 --> 34:38.690
and once
I got charities involved,

34:38.994 --> 34:41.326
I went and looked for some
celebrities that were close by.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.704
And Claudia Wells has a store
really close to here.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.616
So I went there,
and I talked to her,

34:46.918 --> 34:50.706
and I said, "Wouldn't it be cool if we
made, like, a Jennifer Parker hole?"

34:51.005 --> 34:53.668
And she went, "Hmm," and I said,
"a 'Back to the Future' hole."

34:53.967 --> 34:55.878
And she said,
"Okay, that will work."

34:56.177 --> 34:58.009
And so I thought, "Awesome.

34:58.305 --> 35:01.388
"Do you know anybody else in
the movie who could be in it?"

35:01.683 --> 35:03.469
Mayor Goldie Wilson,
Don Fullilove.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.725
So they came out,

35:06.021 --> 35:07.762
got the news out,

35:08.064 --> 35:11.523
became this massive event with them
christening the "Back to the Future" hole.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.559
- Ladies should go first.
Am I right about this?

35:13.862 --> 35:15.523
- Yes!
- Absolutely. Chivalry is not dead.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.278
- So, you're right there.
- Okay, what do I do?

35:17.574 --> 35:19.030
- You put the ball on the tee.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.567
- See the little hole
right here behind you?

35:21.870 --> 35:23.577
- Oh, this is gonna be
a long game, everybody.

35:24.623 --> 35:25.658
It's gonna be a long game.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.745
- And I just did it
all just for that moment,

35:29.044 --> 35:31.206
to help with her charity,
kids in the spotlight.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.541
And I said, "Hey, do you know
anybody who has a time machine?"

35:33.840 --> 35:35.296
And she said, "Sure."

35:35.592 --> 35:37.424
And she found a guy, and he
was gonna bring the car up,

35:37.719 --> 35:39.801
and it ends up

35:40.096 --> 35:42.838
that he was gonna sell his car
right when he said he would do it.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.257
And I got freaked out,
so I looked into getting my own.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.643
And I bought a DeLorean
in Memphis,

35:48.938 --> 35:52.021
and I shipped it to a builder.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.603
And he had
some pre-fabricated parts,

35:53.902 --> 35:55.813
but he also had
some original parts

35:56.112 --> 35:59.980
that were bought in Burbank at Apex Hardware
where they got a lot of the original parts.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.526
And got it all done in time
for Memorial Day, 2014.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.946
It's been crazy. And we're raising
money with every tournament we do.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.205
So it's awesome.
It's a win-win.

36:09.501 --> 36:13.745
- When I came on board,
they had a lot of the car begun.

36:14.047 --> 36:18.006
They got as far, even, as making some
of those time circuits on the outside.

36:18.301 --> 36:21.669
But all the same, it was gonna
take some detail sketches

36:21.971 --> 36:23.928
about where
all the little heat seeks go,

36:24.224 --> 36:26.306
and where are we gonna put
these tubes and pipes,

36:26.601 --> 36:28.558
and how do these things
get arranged on the back?

36:28.853 --> 36:31.015
These are made
as much for the guys in the shop

36:31.314 --> 36:32.475
as for the guys
in the art department.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.014
Just so it stays organized.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.478
And the things
we're talking about,

36:35.777 --> 36:37.893
they end up kind of
where we're hoping they'd be.

36:38.196 --> 36:42.656
On the back of the DeLorean, there's a
little plutonium door that Dr. Brown opens

36:42.951 --> 36:45.864
to load in the plutonium
he's got from the terrorists.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.823
So how does that work?

36:48.123 --> 36:51.206
Well, there's this little door right in
the middle of the Dodge hubcap, right'?

36:51.501 --> 36:54.289
And it has to unscrew, so it's
got kind of a bayonet mount.

36:54.587 --> 36:57.420
So you turn it, and the little
pins index with these slots,

36:57.716 --> 36:58.706
and then you can pull it out.

36:59.008 --> 37:00.715
And there was
a little gag inside.

37:01.010 --> 37:04.844
So he could put the little container
with the plutonium into the holder here,

37:05.140 --> 37:08.178
and then the little tube with the
plutonium would drop out the bottom.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.558
-[Gale] Universal put us in touch
with a product placement company.

37:10.854 --> 37:16.190
Their job was to find partners whose
products would be put in the movie

37:16.484 --> 37:19.067
in exchange for some cash.

37:19.362 --> 37:22.104
And one day,
the product placement guy

37:22.407 --> 37:25.775
and an exec from Universal are in
my office, and they say, "Bob..."

37:26.077 --> 37:28.944
They said to me, "if you change
the DeLorean to a Ford Mustang,

37:29.247 --> 37:31.409
"you'll get $75,000."

37:31.708 --> 37:33.494
And I looked this guy straight
in the eye, and I said...

37:33.793 --> 37:36.660
"Richard, Doc Brown
doesn't drive a [beep] Mustang."

37:51.060 --> 37:54.519
For a while, the DeLorean
was displayed prominently

37:54.814 --> 37:56.350
at the front
of the Universal tour.

37:56.649 --> 38:00.813
And then, for whatever reason, they
stuck it in the back somewhere.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.979
And you could only see it
when the tram drove past it

38:04.282 --> 38:06.319
with a bunch
of other picture cars.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.904
And I didn't pay
any attention to it.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.319
- We would see the a-car on the
backlot at Universal Studios,

38:10.622 --> 38:12.078
And it was sad, you know.

38:12.373 --> 38:15.957
Here's this iconic piece
of so many people's childhoods

38:16.252 --> 38:17.708
just sitting there
falling apart and rotting.

38:18.004 --> 38:20.746
-[Gale]
The car was on display outside,

38:21.049 --> 38:23.381
and you could just
walk right up to it

38:23.676 --> 38:25.917
and take a piece
off of the back.

38:26.221 --> 38:29.213
And people were walking off with pieces.
It was crazy.

38:29.516 --> 38:31.928
-[Joe Walser] I was at Universal
Studios with a buddy of mine,

38:32.227 --> 38:34.343
looked at the car,
and I was like,

38:34.646 --> 38:37.388
"Dude, I could totally build this.
I could do this."

38:37.690 --> 38:39.852
And my buddy was like,
"Let's do it!"

38:40.151 --> 38:42.483
And I was like,
"All right, don't mess with me,

38:42.779 --> 38:45.612
"'cause I'll do it."

38:45.907 --> 38:47.272
We bought a DeLorean

38:47.575 --> 38:51.739
and started to research what it
meant to build a time machine.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.995
It took four years
to build my car.

38:54.290 --> 38:57.123
And I became known pretty quick

38:57.418 --> 39:01.082
for being the guy that was
truly obsessed with nailing it.

39:01.381 --> 39:07.093
- I had met a lot of people who were
in the DeLorean cult, if you will.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.337
The DeLorean fan base.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.756
And there were a couple guys
in I.A.,

39:13.059 --> 39:16.427
Joe Walser and Terry Matalas,
in particular,

39:16.729 --> 39:19.141
who had their own DeLoreans

39:19.440 --> 39:21.556
that they had turned into "Back
to the Future" DeLoreans.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.818
-[Walser] I think Bob
was rightfully disappointed

39:25.113 --> 39:28.447
in the condition of the a-car

39:28.741 --> 39:31.199
and said, "Something
has gotta be done about this."

39:31.494 --> 39:35.829
- The guy at the backlot
on the tour, Fred Diedrich,

39:36.124 --> 39:40.038
he had us come up, and we
brought Terry's car up there,

39:40.336 --> 39:43.374
and showed him what
it could really look like.

39:43.673 --> 39:45.289
And Fred got
very excited about it.

39:45.592 --> 39:49.961
We went to them and said, "Look, the
DeLorean shouldn't look like this.

39:50.263 --> 39:52.755
"This is a part
of Universal's film history.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.263
"Let's restore it.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.096
"And if you guys don't wanna
restore it, that's okay.

39:57.395 --> 40:01.104
"We'll get the Smithsonian to do
it, or the Petersen Car Museum.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.561
"There's a lot of places
that would step up."

40:03.860 --> 40:05.976
And Scott said, "No, no, no, we'll do it.
We'll do it."

40:09.073 --> 40:10.529
-[Walser] For me,
it was all about accuracy.

40:10.825 --> 40:13.783
I was like, "I'm not trying
to build a time machine."

40:14.078 --> 40:16.740
I wasn't trying to build
Joe's time machine.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.247
I was trying to build
the time machine.

40:19.542 --> 40:26.005
The details are as important to me
as the fact that it's a DeLorean.

40:26.299 --> 40:28.540
I'm like, "You're gonna
skimp on the details,

40:28.843 --> 40:30.584
"Why don't you use
a Fiero or something?"

40:30.887 --> 40:33.549
-if I could tell myself when I was
a little kid watching that movie

40:33.848 --> 40:37.216
that someday I'd be working on that
car, I'd be like, "You're crazy."

40:37.518 --> 40:40.510
So you know, it's just awesome.
It's the fulfillment of a dream.

40:40.813 --> 40:47.025
- He let me do some work on the
88-mile-an-hour speedometer box.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.231
And then after we did that,

40:49.530 --> 40:51.271
he's like, "You're gonna
help me build the flux bands

40:51.574 --> 40:54.066
"and put the flux capacitor
back together."

40:54.369 --> 40:55.905
So I think that was
when I had known

40:56.204 --> 40:59.572
that I must have proved myself to
Joe and some of the other members.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.115
It was an honor to be able to put
back together the flux capacitor.

41:02.418 --> 41:04.534
- There were some times
when even Bob Gale said,

41:04.837 --> 41:08.205
"This is actually better than
the car when we first got it."

41:08.508 --> 41:10.624
And that's just...
You're like, "Holy crap! Okay."

41:10.927 --> 41:13.544
The guys that helped us, too,
the Universal staff,

41:13.846 --> 41:16.008
they were always
really eager to help, too.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.514
You could tell that
they were interested, too.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.599
And these are guys that you would
think nothing really fazes them.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.104
You know, they got E.T.'s
head sitting in the corner,

41:25.400 --> 41:26.686
and it's like,
"Oh, no big deal. E.T.'s head."

41:26.985 --> 41:30.273
Even these guys that
work on props day by day,

41:30.571 --> 41:33.984
you know, this was still
like a holy grail for them, too.

41:34.283 --> 41:40.655
- One of the coolest things I've done since the
restoration is just go hang out by the car,

41:40.957 --> 41:42.948
just listen
to people's reactions.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.959
-[Ed Hillary] It's so great
seeing somebody with their kids,

41:46.254 --> 41:48.996
explaining what this is
that they're looking at.

41:49.298 --> 41:53.508
The kids are like, "Yeah, okay," but you know
that the dads are just, like, flipping out.

41:53.803 --> 41:57.341
The car is one of the stars
of the movie,

41:57.640 --> 42:00.507
and here you are, like,
12 inches from it, you know.

42:00.810 --> 42:04.348
I mean, it would be like being 12
inches away from Michael J. Fox.

42:04.647 --> 42:07.184
You know, it's a celebrity
in its own right.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.224
- We didn't half-ass anything.

42:09.527 --> 42:13.612
I mean, we worked really hard
to nail it,

42:13.906 --> 42:16.318
to nail every single piece
on the car,

42:16.617 --> 42:22.112
so that everybody could get to see it
the way that it was meant to look.

42:30.173 --> 42:33.586
- My name is Bill Shea, and I
live in central Massachusetts,

42:33.885 --> 42:36.627
and you might call me
a "Back to the Future" fanatic.

42:36.929 --> 42:38.670
-[Patrick Shea]
My father, Bill, and I

42:38.973 --> 42:43.092
are the lucky owners of the "Back
to the Future lll" DeLorean

42:43.394 --> 42:46.557
and the "Back to the Future <i>ll</i>
and lll" Toyota pickup.

42:48.649 --> 42:52.859
The pinnacle moment for me
was when the ramps came down,

42:53.154 --> 42:55.236
and that DeLorean
came out of that truck.

42:55.531 --> 42:56.987
And you saw her
for the first time

42:57.283 --> 42:59.115
with the smoke, and all the
noise, and everything like that.

42:59.410 --> 43:02.823
And he rolled it off, and they had the sound
effects of the exhaust and everything.

43:06.334 --> 43:09.122
- All of my life, I've been
involved in collectibles,

43:09.420 --> 43:13.789
whether they be comic books,
or coins, or military antiques.

43:14.092 --> 43:16.424
That's been absolutely
part of my life,

43:16.719 --> 43:18.175
and a very enjoyable
part of my life,

43:18.471 --> 43:20.587
and something
that I make a living at,

43:20.890 --> 43:22.472
and had the opportunity
to employ my family.

43:22.767 --> 43:25.304
- You know, Marty,
you look so familiar to me.

43:25.603 --> 43:26.684
Do I know your mother?

43:28.439 --> 43:29.929
- Yeah, I think maybe you do.

43:30.233 --> 43:33.021
-[Patrick Shea] My mother works
full-time for my father, as do i.

43:33.319 --> 43:36.107
And most recently, my daughter has come
on board, and she now works full-time.

43:36.405 --> 43:40.615
So the daughter, the grandkids, the son-in-lavv,
the mother, the father, the whole family...

43:40.910 --> 43:43.493
It's a wonderful experience.
I'm very, very fortunate.

43:43.788 --> 43:48.203
- My son, Patrick, who is very
much involved in everything I do,

43:48.501 --> 43:50.037
including the cars,

43:50.336 --> 43:53.874
and without whom, I wouldn't do
this, because he's a real mechanic.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.914
I'm Irish.
He has more patience than i.

43:56.217 --> 43:58.675
I think he's inherited his
mother's patience and the like.

43:58.970 --> 44:00.085
- Ready.

44:04.058 --> 44:05.890
- That's running perfect now,
Bill.

44:06.185 --> 44:10.554
- This is the home of the rebirth of
the beautiful truck you see behind me,

44:10.857 --> 44:16.478
Marty's 1985 Toyota Xtra Cab
SR5 4x4.

44:18.030 --> 44:19.987
- Check out that 4x4.

44:20.283 --> 44:21.398
That is hot.

44:21.701 --> 44:23.533
- The truck that
was used in Part One

44:23.828 --> 44:27.321
was a contest.
They gave it way.

44:27.623 --> 44:29.455
The stow goes it was destroyed.

44:29.750 --> 44:31.411
I don't know for sure,
so I can't really say.

44:31.711 --> 44:34.749
But they needed a truck
to do Part Two and Part Three

44:35.047 --> 44:38.005
that was exactly like
the truck from Part One.

44:38.301 --> 44:41.339
So they contacted
this movie rental company.

44:49.395 --> 44:53.730
After that, it went back to its normal
life as a movie studio rental vehicle.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.642
-[Man] It's like a celebrity being
in the garage all the time.

44:57.987 --> 45:00.775
Extra care is taken
every step of the way.

45:01.073 --> 45:05.818
It's really special to be part
of something this unique.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.610
You know,
it's once-in-a-lifetime.

45:13.502 --> 45:16.494
-[Bill Shea] The part
three car happens to be

45:16.797 --> 45:20.540
the one and only
screen-used DeLorean

45:20.843 --> 45:23.881
that will ever be
in private hands.

45:24.180 --> 45:26.842
According to most
in the consensus,

45:27.141 --> 45:30.725
there were seven DeLoreans that
were used in the three movies,

45:31.020 --> 45:33.307
and three of them still exist.

45:33.606 --> 45:36.223
One is in Universal Studios
in Hollywood.

45:36.525 --> 45:39.267
The other is in
Universal Studios in Florida.

45:39.570 --> 45:42.904
And of course, one is sitting
right behind us here.

45:43.199 --> 45:46.533
When all was said and done,
and the hammer was knocked down,

45:46.827 --> 45:51.742
including the commission
charges, it was around $528,000.

45:52.041 --> 45:55.784
And of course, we had bought a few
other things at that auction already.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.749
We had purchased some actual
props from the movie.

45:59.048 --> 46:01.540
So I was warmed up,
let's put it that way.

46:01.842 --> 46:05.335
And I work hard, I stay
straight, and I felt that...

46:05.638 --> 46:08.050
Guess what, I really feel
I made a good investment.

46:08.349 --> 46:09.259
- Shoot.

46:13.479 --> 46:15.061
-[Patrick Shea]
My father mentioned that

46:15.356 --> 46:16.767
if they could build
a sarcophagus big enough

46:17.066 --> 46:19.603
for him to take all of his toys
with him, that's what he'd enjoy.

46:19.902 --> 46:22.894
But I don't think he wants that. I think he
wants everybody in the family to enjoy it.

46:23.197 --> 46:27.282
Between me, my daughter,
my son, my grandkids, my family,

46:27.576 --> 46:29.158
It's gonna be
in the family forcer.

46:29.453 --> 46:34.573
- I have found that "Back to the Future"
is unquestionably a family affair.

46:34.875 --> 46:37.958
When you see people
come up to the car,

46:38.254 --> 46:39.995
generally, they're not
by themselves.

46:40.298 --> 46:43.666
They're with their wife, they're with their
children, and everybody gets involved,

46:43.968 --> 46:45.379
and they stay there.

46:45.678 --> 46:47.419
And their kids are just as excited
about it as the parents are.

46:47.722 --> 46:52.637
Sc once again, it transcends the
generations, and that'll never change.

46:52.935 --> 46:55.142
-[Instrumental version of
"Power of Love" playing]

47:03.654 --> 47:04.485
- Thank you so much.

47:10.870 --> 47:13.703
-[Probert] There are car shows
around the country,

47:13.998 --> 47:15.705
and the DeLorean car show
is one of them,

47:16.000 --> 47:18.833
and it has a lot
of enthusiastic members.

47:19.128 --> 47:21.745
-[Woman] I love
the DeLorean community.

47:22.048 --> 47:24.005
When we went to the DCS show,

47:24.300 --> 47:28.419
it was incredible how everyone was so friendly,
and so into it, and all the things they do.

47:28.721 --> 47:31.338
I just love that we could be a
part of something like that.

47:31.640 --> 47:34.928
With something that's so close
to us that brought us together.

47:35.227 --> 47:36.217
It's incredible.

47:54.830 --> 47:56.412
- The wonderful thing
about this show

47:56.707 --> 47:59.699
is that so many things
amazing have happened.

48:00.002 --> 48:04.872
But today, you get to have something
that's going to be even more amazing.

48:05.174 --> 48:07.882
There's a young man here
that I'm looking for.

48:08.177 --> 48:11.636
His name is nick. Nick?
Oh, Nick!

48:11.931 --> 48:16.346
Nick would like to take a moment
with all of you here.

48:16.644 --> 48:20.558
- Everybody is incredibly
friendly, and incredibly helpful,

48:20.856 --> 48:22.642
and very motivational.

48:22.942 --> 48:25.650
They don't try
to bring you down, you know.

48:25.945 --> 48:27.686
Everyone thinks, you know,

48:27.988 --> 48:30.355
you're gonna bring a beat-down oar to a
oar show, you're gonna get ripped apart.

48:30.658 --> 48:33.241
Quite the opposite. We got
there, and they praised us.

48:33.536 --> 48:37.655
They were happy to see a car
in the shape it was,

48:37.957 --> 48:39.994
'cause, you know,
everybody has a complete car.

48:40.292 --> 48:44.331
Here we are with just a body tub on
some wheels and some wires hanging out.

48:46.340 --> 48:48.126
It's nice to examine
what's underneath the skin.

48:48.426 --> 48:50.667
This is our first DCS,
me and Meghan.

48:50.970 --> 48:53.052
Meghan, please come on up.

48:53.347 --> 48:54.633
Come on. Don't be shy.

48:54.932 --> 48:57.469
She's very shy.
So come on, Meghan. Come on.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.224
-[Meghan] I didn't know
he was planning anything.

48:59.520 --> 49:02.012
I was just excited
to go see the play.

49:02.314 --> 49:04.225
So it was definitely
a big surprise to me.

49:04.525 --> 49:07.438
- Meghan, I love you more than
anything in the entire world.

49:11.574 --> 49:13.281
In front of everybody here...

49:29.383 --> 49:32.842

and be my wife?

49:35.222 --> 49:36.587
Will you marry me?

49:38.017 --> 49:39.553
- Of course. Yes.

49:42.813 --> 49:45.305

49:48.194 --> 49:49.559

50:37.284 --> 50:39.195
-[Shawn Kerkhoff] I got to work
on a show called "American Dad"

50:39.495 --> 50:42.157
where an episode of the show was
called "The DeLorean Story-an,"

50:42.456 --> 50:45.448
which was partially inspired
by me getting my own DeLorean

50:45.751 --> 50:47.207
and my fandom
of "Back to the Future."

50:47.503 --> 50:50.120
- Take it easy out there,
Mr. Smith, Mr. Kerkhoff.

50:50.422 --> 50:52.880
I mean, what kind of a rush
could you two be in'?

50:53.175 --> 50:54.665
You're in time machines.

50:54.969 --> 50:56.630
You got all the time you need.

50:59.640 --> 51:00.721
- I don't get it.

51:01.016 --> 51:02.131
- They let me have the honor
of being animated

51:02.434 --> 51:04.471
and get to do my own voice
in the show.

51:04.770 --> 51:06.556
- Hey, that's not your DeLorean.

51:06.855 --> 51:08.892
- Oh, Whoops. My mistake.

51:10.609 --> 51:11.940
- Butthead.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.772
- A lot of my positive memories,
a lot of my happy memories,

51:14.071 --> 51:18.315
are connected to things I've done with
the car or as part of the fandom.

51:18.617 --> 51:20.654
And it inspired
my interest in sound.

51:20.953 --> 51:24.241
The sounds in the movie were very
impactful and very effective,

51:24.540 --> 51:27.749
and my interest and my career
in sound came from that.

51:28.043 --> 51:30.910
It's definitely influenced
my world as a whole.

51:31.213 --> 51:32.624
And it'll always be
a positive thing.

51:32.923 --> 51:34.334
-[moaning] Oh, yeah.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.169

51:44.268 --> 51:47.306
-[Marco Pasqua] I'd be lying if I said it
was easy growing up with a disability.

51:47.605 --> 51:50.768
I actually kind of connected
a little bit with George McFly.

51:51.066 --> 51:52.682
He's a guy that was an outcast.

51:52.985 --> 51:55.443
He had big dreams.
He had big goals

51:55.738 --> 51:59.982
of being this person that no one
else thought that he could be.

52:02.036 --> 52:03.322
I have cerebral palsy,

52:03.621 --> 52:06.534
and in my case,
it's called spastic triplegia.

52:06.832 --> 52:08.789
That affects my two legs
and my right arm.

52:09.084 --> 52:14.545
The connection in living here in the
area, essentially, where Mike grew up

52:14.840 --> 52:16.205
is just fantastic.

52:16.508 --> 52:20.217
I mean, I know some of his family
members and his nephew Jeff.

52:20.512 --> 52:22.719
For me to be able
to go out into the world

52:23.015 --> 52:24.676
and know that I'm actually
from the same community,

52:24.975 --> 52:28.764
and that here's Mike, a guy from
Burnaby, growing up with his family,

52:29.063 --> 52:30.929
and he's done so much
for himself and his family,

52:31.231 --> 52:33.768
and was able to sort of
go off into Hollywood,

52:34.068 --> 52:36.150
and find a new home
in New York.

52:36.445 --> 52:38.152
If he's showing that
that was possible for him,

52:38.447 --> 52:41.565
then I knew that for me, and what I
wanted to do in following my passions,

52:41.867 --> 52:44.780
then it was possible
for me as well.

52:45.079 --> 52:47.867
My dad was an immigrant.
He came here from Italy.

52:48.165 --> 52:49.906
And I've said this
in my presentations before,

52:50.209 --> 52:52.166
he had huge dreams
of me being a soccer star.

52:52.461 --> 52:54.247
Well, obviously,
being in a chair,

52:54.546 --> 52:56.128
I'm not gonna necessarily
be the next soccer star.

52:56.423 --> 52:59.461
But I wanted to show him
that these things were possible.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.376
So instead of getting involved
in one sport,

53:01.679 --> 53:03.966
I went ahead
and got involved in five sports,

53:04.264 --> 53:07.177
wheelchair basketball, horseback
riding, weight lifting, swimming.

53:07.476 --> 53:08.966
I mean, you name it, I did it.

53:09.269 --> 53:12.682
And I was able to go on to compete
in the BC Summer and Winter Games

53:12.981 --> 53:14.142
for athletes with disabilities.

53:14.441 --> 53:17.934
And I did earn 22 gold,
1 O silver, <i>2</i> bronze medals

53:18.237 --> 53:20.569
in various sports
throughout the time.

53:20.864 --> 53:22.946
And I remember
thinking to myself,

53:23.242 --> 53:28.203
"Well, I wasn't able to do it in the
traditional fashion, but I was able to do it."

53:28.497 --> 53:31.159
I was always looking
for motivational figures,

53:31.458 --> 53:34.200
figures that could push rne through
the next day, and the next day,

53:34.503 --> 53:35.743
'cause it's not always easy.

53:36.046 --> 53:39.038
And, of course, right away,
I connected with Michael J. Fox

53:39.341 --> 53:41.548
as far as just a figure
that I could look up to.

53:41.844 --> 53:45.007
I started my own speaking business
to help inspire other people

53:45.305 --> 53:48.172
and show them that if you creatively
utilize your best energy,

53:48.475 --> 53:51.513
in your own life, with the right
people and the right team around you,

53:51.812 --> 53:53.223
then anything is
really possible.

53:59.111 --> 54:03.070
-[Gale] The fans are instrumental in
keeping "Back to the Future" alive.

54:03.365 --> 54:05.356
-[Stephen Clark] Probably if
my wife had a time machine,

54:05.659 --> 54:08.572
she probably would have steered
me away from ever seeing it.

54:08.871 --> 54:11.909
But it was not
until a year later

54:12.207 --> 54:16.667
when the movie came out on VHS,
on home video for the first time,

54:16.962 --> 54:20.796
that I really got involved, really
got my geek switch turned on.

54:21.091 --> 54:23.924
- Bttf.com, which is now
backtothefuture.com,

54:24.219 --> 54:29.055
has become the go-to site for all
information about "Back to the Future."

54:29.349 --> 54:31.636
It's the best place to find "Back
to the Future" merchandise.

54:31.935 --> 54:35.223
Stephen has become
a good friend over the years.

54:35.522 --> 54:36.853
We use him now as a consultant,

54:37.149 --> 54:39.857
because he's got
such great fan insight.

54:40.152 --> 54:41.984
-[Clark] One of the other things
that we do is

54:42.279 --> 54:45.567
get involved with the licensees
of official product.

54:45.866 --> 54:50.861
We've worked with Mattel, and Lego,
and a lot of the other companies.

54:51.163 --> 54:52.653
I've written
a lot of the material

54:52.956 --> 54:55.243
that goes on the back
of the packaging for products,

54:55.542 --> 54:57.624
the booklets
inside the products.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.582
And kind of authenticate
their efforts.

55:00.881 --> 55:02.667
-[Gale] And he does it so well

55:02.966 --> 55:06.584
that it becomes the portal,
the source authority, really,

55:06.887 --> 55:09.003
for all news
about "Back to the Future."

55:09.306 --> 55:14.551
To such an extent that he does the
job better than the studio could do,

55:14.853 --> 55:16.764
because he has
the passion for it.

55:17.064 --> 55:19.101
- There's a lot of books
in the works now

55:19.399 --> 55:22.687
that We're actively working
with the book authors on.

55:22.986 --> 55:24.727
- Currently, I actually have
a book coming out

55:25.030 --> 55:29.115
called "The Back to the Future
Almanac 1985 - 2015,"

55:29.409 --> 55:32.902
which is about all the "Back to the
Future" memorabilia that's been made.

55:33.205 --> 55:35.242
-[Rich Handley]
The first one is the lexicon.

55:35.541 --> 55:38.659
Inside is a breakdown of every
person, place, or thing.

55:38.961 --> 55:43.330
When I say every, I'm kind of anally
compulsive about this sort of thing.

55:43.632 --> 55:46.499
If it's a license plate,
and I was able to read it.

55:46.802 --> 55:48.839
Or if it's a license plate,
and I wasn't able to read it

55:49.137 --> 55:50.673
until I spent a half an hour
staring at a screen

55:50.973 --> 55:53.635
that had been blown up six
times too many, it's in there.

55:53.934 --> 55:56.517
Everything, basically,
that appears in the movies,

55:56.812 --> 55:59.019
in the cartoons,
in the comic books,

55:59.314 --> 56:01.430
the video game
from telltale games,

56:01.733 --> 56:06.478
the collectible card game, the old draft
scripts, we mined everything we could.

56:06.780 --> 56:10.648
- My interaction with fans, I
worry sometimes frustrates them,

56:10.951 --> 56:12.908
because they know more
about the movie than I do.

56:13.203 --> 56:17.197
I mean, people oome up to rne and ask
me questions about flux capacitors,

56:17.499 --> 56:21.663
and I say, "I was just standing
in a parking lot in Puente Hills

56:21.962 --> 56:22.952
"with flames
running between my legs.

56:23.255 --> 56:24.165
"I had no idea
what was happening."

56:24.464 --> 56:26.330
- I started out
just as a superfan.

56:26.633 --> 56:28.920
I was one of those guys that
was looking for information.

56:29.219 --> 56:32.962
And I know there's a lot of other folks
out there looking for that information.

56:33.265 --> 56:36.508
And we've got
a world-wide audience now.

56:36.810 --> 56:41.054
"Back to the Future" knows no
boundaries within a certain country.

56:41.356 --> 56:43.097
It's world-wide.

56:56.330 --> 56:58.697
-[Fabien Riggall] Secret Cinema
is a film organization

56:58.999 --> 57:02.742
that essentially creates
immersive film experiences

57:03.045 --> 57:06.629
where the audience become part
of a story.

57:06.924 --> 57:09.757
For me, "Back to the Future"
is one of my favorite films,

57:10.052 --> 57:14.467
and it represents a sort of
nostalgia of this innocent time.

57:14.765 --> 57:19.225
And the 1955 part of "Back to
the Future," I think represents

57:19.519 --> 57:22.056
this kind of
dream-like Technicolor,

57:22.356 --> 57:26.441
which I think has such resonance with what
we're trying to do with Secret Cinema,

57:26.735 --> 57:28.521
which is this sense of romance,

57:28.820 --> 57:32.279
this sense of ambition, this sense
that you can be anyone you wanna be,

57:32.574 --> 57:34.235
and you can do
anything you wanna do.

57:34.534 --> 57:37.697
-[Man] Secret Cinema is about people
engaging with a film in a different way.

57:37.996 --> 57:39.578
Experiencing it,
being part of the cast,

57:39.873 --> 57:43.332
feeling a little bit of what it must
have felt like making that movie.

57:43.627 --> 57:46.085
And that's why everybody's here.
That's why everybody loves it.

57:46.380 --> 57:49.543
It's kind of the social media
of old media.

57:52.094 --> 57:55.553
-[Riggall] Well, we wanted to
build the town of Hill Valley.

57:55.847 --> 57:58.214
From the beginning, it was like we wanna
build the real town of Hill \/alley,

57:58.517 --> 58:00.804
one in which
every single shop is replicated.

58:01.103 --> 58:03.936
And you go into the shop, and
there is a little world inside.

58:04.231 --> 58:06.768
There is actors playing
the roles of the shopkeepers.

58:07.067 --> 58:08.978
The audience themselves
were given characters.

58:09.277 --> 58:13.145
And for us, the idea of it

58:13.448 --> 58:16.065
is inspired from
the "Sandman" moment,

58:16.368 --> 58:18.325
when Marty first arrives
in Hill Valley.

58:18.620 --> 58:22.158
And he's thrown into this world,
and he has to find his way.

58:22.457 --> 58:25.415
-[clock tower bell ringing]

58:30.882 --> 58:34.420
-[Riggall] We actually built a
small farm with over 20 animals,

58:34.720 --> 58:35.960
which is Peabody's farm.

58:36.263 --> 58:38.049
And the audience arrive
through the farm

58:38.348 --> 58:40.055
in the same way
Marty does in the film.

58:40.350 --> 58:45.595
Then the suburbia is having each different
house from the characters in the film

58:45.897 --> 58:48.639
from George McFly, to Biff
Tannen, all the way through.

58:48.942 --> 58:53.402
So that the audience literally
were taken into the world.

58:53.697 --> 58:56.439
-" Back to the Future" is the
greatest '80s movie ever made.

58:56.742 --> 58:58.653
- It's my favorite film ever.
- Favorite film ever.

58:58.952 --> 59:00.863
- I couldn't not come.

59:01.163 --> 59:04.747
-[Riggall] I think because "Back to the Future"
represents something in people's hearts...

59:06.626 --> 59:09.334
It's something that represents
a sense of ambition

59:09.629 --> 59:11.620
and a sense of wanting to be
whatever you want to be.

59:11.923 --> 59:13.755
And I think
when people come to this show,

59:14.051 --> 59:16.213
why they wanna come
is they wanna be that character.

59:16.511 --> 59:17.592
They wanna be Marty McFly.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.219
They wanna travel
back to the future.

59:19.514 --> 59:21.221
They wanna fall in love with their mother.
I'm joking.

59:21.516 --> 59:23.928
You know, they wanna
have an adventure.

59:29.232 --> 59:32.190
- What's that thing he's on?
- It's a board with wheels.

59:32.486 --> 59:34.022
- He's an absolute dream.

59:34.321 --> 59:37.689
-[Adam F. Goldberg] I remember my mom
came back from the movie theater

59:37.991 --> 59:41.404
and said to rne, "I just saw this amazing
movie called 'Back to the Future.'

59:41.703 --> 59:45.037
"It's about a boy who goes back
and falls in love with his mom."

59:45.332 --> 59:46.572
And it was so interesting to me.

59:46.875 --> 59:48.536
I was like,
"That sounds terrible."

59:50.128 --> 59:54.338
Because as a kid with an
overbearing, Jewish mother,

59:54.633 --> 59:57.091
I'm like, "Who would make
a movie like that?"

59:57.385 --> 59:58.625
- I love you so much.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.090
I love you, too.

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:01.594
I love you.
- Mom!

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:02.846
- I love you, boopy.

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:04.552
I love you so much.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.559
Hey, you with the window open,
tell my baby I love him!

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:11.848
Adam, if you need to make,
call me. I'll pick you up.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.686
- Of course, that's not
what the movie is about at all,

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:16.852
but I loved that my mom, to her,
that's what the movie was about,

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:20.364
a boy who goes back in time
and hangs out with his mom.

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.275
- I was so excited about it.

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:27.322
I made my parents, who were separated
at the time, go see it with me,

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:31.162
'cause it had such
a generational theme to it.

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:34.920
And maybe subconsciously
I was like,

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:36.876
"Maybe my parents
will get back together...

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:39.382
[laughs] "if they watch this."

01:00:39.678 --> 01:00:40.793
They did get back together.

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:44.464
And I got to Work
under Zemeckis years later,

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:48.259
and one of
his development people,

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:51.099
as he was walking through
the lobby at lmageMovers,

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:53.560
said, "You got his parents
back together."

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:55.145
And he was like, "Huh?"

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:57.559
"His parents got back together
'cause of 'Back to the Future."'

01:00:57.863 --> 01:00:59.604
Which is not strictly true.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:02.068
But assuming that it was,

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:04.278
Zemeckis's response was,
"Eh,goodf

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:08.492
Because he's probably
heard that 7,000 times.

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.334
-[interviewer] Michael, here
we are at this royal premiere.

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:16.415
Huge, great crowd standing
behind us now as we're talking.

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:17.671
-[Fox]
Yeah, I'm not nervous at all.

01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:20.958
- What do you make
of an occasion like this?

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:21.966
- It's...

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:24.674
It's wonderfully exciting.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:28.637
I mean, it's, uh...
It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:33.680
If indeed it is only a once-in-a-lifetime
thing for me, I'll die satisfied.

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:36.940
-[Fox] The greeting line
where we met the royals,

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:39.146
Princess Diana
and Prince Charles,

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:43.064
and we had this little guy, this little
super-serious protocol guy tell us,

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.948
"You can't speak
unless you're spoken to.

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:46.825
"You can't turn your back
on a royal.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.363
"You can't touch a royal. You can't..."
All these things you can't do.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:54.203
And I was Canadian,
so I had some skin in the game.

01:01:54.502 --> 01:01:56.084
I was a little careful
what I did.

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:57.540
I didn't wanna make
a fool out of myself.

01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:59.170
So we do the thing,
and we meet them,

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:02.549
and I managed to avoid
any kind of royal gaffe.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:06.177
And then we were
sitting in the theater,

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:08.510
and I realized that
the seat next to me was empty.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:10.390
And we were standing waiting
for the royals to come in,

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:14.679
and it dawns on me that Princess Diana
is gonna be sitting next to me.

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:17.848
And so, sure enough, she comes in.
She sits down next to me.

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:20.267
And the movie starts,

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:21.981
and it occurs to me

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.068
that I'm, like, a fake yawn
and an arm stretch away

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:27.278
from being on a date
with the Princess of Wales.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.193
- She would chuckle now and then.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:34.616
But when the truckload
of turds, manure,

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:38.832
was dumped on Biff and his gang
in the convertible...

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:41.838
-[All] Shit!

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:48.425
- She outright laughed.

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:52.717
You know, she just...
That conservative... You know...

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:56.721
dropped,
and she totally went with it.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:58.889
So it reaches everyone.

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:02.480
- And then the other thing I realized very
quickly was that I had to go to the bathroom.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.565
And I was screwed,

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:07.856
because I can't say to her, "Excuse me,
your highness. I have to go to the loo."

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:09.524
'Cause I can't talk to her
unless she talks to me.

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:12.661
I can't tap her on the shoulder
and motion I'm going out.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:15.288
And I can't get up
and turn my back on her.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:18.450
So I'd have to kind of, like,
moonwalk backwards out of the theater

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:20.209
to get out of there.

01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:23.293
And so I sat there, and I was
just in agony the whole time.

01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:25.548
So the whole thing was

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:28.962
I sat in total pain watching the
movie with the Princess of Wales,

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:31.676
And it was great. It was...

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:33.181
She was smoking hot.

01:03:45.447 --> 01:03:47.029
-[Oliver Holler]
Everybody has dreams, right?

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:51.450
And owning a DeLorean
was our dream.

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.736
But life gets in the way.

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:58.078
You know, reality,
day-to-day things.

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:01.869
And I think everybody has probably
said at one time or another,

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.209
"if I ever win the lottery,
I'm going to..."

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:05.463
- To do that.
- Do that.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.170
I'm gonna get me this.
I'm gonna buy something.

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:12.305
- Yeah, but as you know
if you're into statistics,

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:15.341
we all have a better chance of getting
struck by a bolt of lightning

01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:16.929
than winning the lottery.
- Yeah.

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:19.344
And we did get struck by a
bolt of lightning in a sense.

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:21.684
It was August 4, 2000,

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:24.145
Oliver was diagnosed
with cancer.

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:26.151
- And the doctor gave me
six months to live.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.857
- Fl'erry Holler] You get your bucket list
in line when somebody gives you six months.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.400
- Yeah, it's pretty motivational.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:37.116
So we made a will,

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:42.376
and we traveled a little bit, and visited family
and friends that we hadn't seen in a while,

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:44.331
basically to say
goodbye to them.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:46.713
And we got something
in the mail

01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:49.716
that said that we had been
approved for a credit card.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:51.126
- Yeah, a nice, big balance.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:55.013
- So we maxed out that card
on a DeLorean,

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.891
and we made it
into a time machine.

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:04.981
One thing that I think
we should mention,

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.187
we actually built
the time machine ourselves.

01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:11.404
This was roughly 15 years ago.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:15.442
All we had to go on
was a VHS copy of the movie.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.201
- From a distance,
it looked perfect.

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:20.364
But it was kind of almost a folk
art interpretation of the car,

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:23.750
'cause when you got close, they
had just used what they'd found

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:26.127
to make this car.
It was fantastic.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:29.256
- We would pause
the videotape player,

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:31.292
and the picture would be
a little jerky,

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:35.383
and I would make little sketches and
notes about what we were seeing,

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:37.639
and then we would
fabricate it ourselves

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.517
out of metal and scraps
that we found at the scrapyard.

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:42.519
-[Sche1'-fe] It's like an
impressionist painting or something.

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:44.430
You get close, and you see
those brush strokes, right?

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:47.099
You got close, and you saw what
they used to put it together.

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:49.313
You stepped back,
the effect was perfect.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:54.732
- I think the conversion of his
DeLorean to a "Back to the Future" car

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:55.819
kind of saved his life.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:57.860
- And what are they doing
with that car?

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:03.329
They drive around the country working
for Michael J. Fox's charity.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:04.616
That's amazing.

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:06.535
- We're volunteers.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:11.127
We chose to do this because it was,
for us, the right thing to do.

01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:13.963
Meeting Michael Wasn't really
on the radar.

01:06:14.262 --> 01:06:16.219
"Wouldn't that be nice?"
was the thought.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:20.974
When we did meet him,
he knew who we were.

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:25.012
He knew we were Terry and Oliver from
South Carolina, and Team Fox members,

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.521
and that is humbling.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.727
-[Fox] For years,
Terry and Oliver Holler

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:32.315
have been hitting the road in their DeLorean
time machine to speed a future without PD.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:33.945
They've raised
dollars and awareness

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.322
in more states and countries
than any other Team Fox member.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:39.906
They've spent more time in a DeLorean than
even I have, which is saying something.

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:42.037
The people that are
big "Back to the Future" fans

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:46.075
have been huge supporters of our efforts
to try to find a oure for Parkinson's.

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:49.085
And more importantly,
they've just shown interest

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:54.966
and an ongoing sense
of curiosity and concern

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:58.720
for me
and for what we're doing.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:00.176
It's amazing.

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:04.134
It's great to have a bunch
of lunatics on your side.

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.929
'Cause they're crazy,
but they're crazy-good.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:08.939
-[Oliver Holler] Well, we set
a personal goal for ourselves

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:13.273
to drive the DeLorean time
machine to all 5O states.

01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:15.232
-[Terry Holler]
And we've done it.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.648
-[Oliver Holler] Raising money and awareness
for the Michael .J. Fox Foundation.

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:20.488
-[Terry Holler] We've raised over
a quarter of a million dollars.

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:23.700
-[Oliver Holler] When we built the
car, it was for selfish reasons.

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:28.413
We loved the movie, and we wanted
to drive a DeLorean time machine.

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:32.420
And that was a wonderful thrill
and an accomplishment personally,

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.581
but we never...

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.500
just like the car,
there were no blueprints.

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:42.219
And our life has taken us places we
really never knew it would take us.

01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:43.973
- We're one of their sponsors.

01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:46.601
We do all their web promotion
for them,

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.512
host their websites

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:53.981
to allow them to get out and travel across
the nation and into other countries

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:58.193
raising funds for the Michael .J. Fox
Foundation for Parkinson's research.

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:02.280
- We say this at every panel
we're asked to present.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:05.116
Your future hasn't
been written yet, right?

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:06.371
- No one's has.

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.498
- No one's has!

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.955
Your future is
whatever you make it.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:13.291
- So, make it a good one.
- Make it a good one.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:14.250
- Ta-da.

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:17.381
-["Jaws" Theme playing]

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:22.880
-[screaming]

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:26.595
-[Gale] People always say to us, "Well, you
guys must have known you were gonna do sequels

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:28.430
"because of the ending
of the first movie."

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.095
Well, no, we didn't.

01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:33.265
And the ending of the first movie
is the heroes get in the car

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:38.404
and ride off into the sunset for another
adventure. That's just a classic ending.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:41.359
- Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't
have enough road to get up to 88.

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:45.448
-"Where we're going,
we don't need roads."

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:47.828
-[Gale] And as Bob Zemeckis
has said many times,

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.238
if we knew
we were gonna do a sequel,

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.499
we would have never
put Jennifer in the car.

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.660
Because when it was time
to write the sequel,

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:56.203
we didn't know what to do with her,
and we end up knocking her out.

01:08:56.506 --> 01:08:59.465
She's unconscious
for Part Two and Part Three.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:01.377
- Doc, what the hell
are you doing?

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:04.511
- Relax, Marty. It's just a
sleep-inducing alpha rhythm generator.

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:09.392
-[Gale] Home video happens in
between the two movies, basically,

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:13.975
where we put "To be Continued"
at the end of Part One

01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:18.143
when we released it
for home video.

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:23.031
If people saw it on a VHS for their
first time, that's what they think.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:25.033
We took that off of the DVD.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:28.912
- The most fun perhaps was "Back
to the Future lll" for me.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.707
There was horseback riding,
which I love doing.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:35.038
- Somehow, "Back to the
Future lll" is just as funny

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.124
as "Back to the Future"
I and ll.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.538
I think that might actually be
a large part of it.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:41.674
It's a trilogy
that doesn't suck.

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:44.426
There's no point where you watch it
and go, "That's the really bad one."

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:46.679
- Two and three, I think...
Come on.

01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:51.263
I know you're interviewing Gale
and I think Zemeokis.

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:54.020
I mean, these guys are my heroes 'cause
they wrote "Back to the Future,"

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:57.433
but they took seven years
to write "Back to the Future."

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:59.772
And come on.

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:02.984
Everybody knows
<i>ll</i> and Ill suck.

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:05.444
-"Back to the Future ll"
has always been my favorite.

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:07.325
Because I like that it's dark.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.110
I like that it get
into the headiness

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:12.497
of what would happen
if just one little thing turned.

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:13.998
And I love the future idea.

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:15.875
The whole concept of
what's the future gonna be?

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:18.377
- I guess you guys
aren't ready for that yet.

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:21.581
But your kids are gonna love it.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:28.009
-[Kontras] They went back into the first
movie. I mean, it's never been done,

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:29.672
and it's never been done since.

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:34.470
What a brilliant, brilliant
stroke of creativity as a writer.

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:36.058
I thought it was great.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:40.271
- It suggested this digital
reality that we all live in now,

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:44.063
this kind of cyber-world
that we all occupy.

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:50.987
- I had, as you know, been strung up and
put in an "ortho-lev" of the future.

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:55.328
It was rough, because being hung upside
down almost all day for two weeks

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:57.287
is a bit hard on the back.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.579
But then again, they didn't wanna get
me down in between takes all the time.

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:03.670
So they had built a ladder
with a board on it

01:11:03.968 --> 01:11:07.757
that I could just do my sit-up
and lie back down on.

01:11:08.055 --> 01:11:11.548
They put it underneath rne, so they wouldn't
have to get rne down in between takes,

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:14.343
which would have been
an extra couple of minutes.

01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:16.227
And time definitely
was money on this shoot.

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:18.638
-[Fox]
What's really cool about it is

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:22.479
the generational aspect of it
still plays.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.646
I mean,
there's still that confused...

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.438
- I'm young!
- I'm old!

01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:32.862
- Not enmity, but just kind
of suspicion and befuddlement

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:36.873
between the previous generation
and the next generation.

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:42.413
I mean, I have three teenage daughters
and a son who's in his mid-20s,

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.251
and I don't understand
what the hell they're saying.

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.593
-[Kevin Pike] A lot of times I get
asked about the special effects.

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:53.927
What did we do?

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:56.514
The clock tower,
the speaker gag,

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.180
Doc Brown's lab,
the trails of fire.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:03.646
A lot of work went into it on the
special-effects level that were very common.

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:07.529
Wind, rain, fire, snow, all of
the normal stuff that we do.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:09.531
A lot of prop creation
that we did.

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:11.567
And all of that
is our rote work.

01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:13.451
And that was our trade
and our craft.

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:16.238
And the stow didn't demand

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:20.205
some of the bigger visual
effects that are now so common.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:22.995
So it doesn't date itself.

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:28.292
People ask me about how come we
never had any CGI work on "Jaws."

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:31.086
Well, we didn't have the C.
We never had computers.

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:32.971
We didn't even have cell phones.

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:35.132
Now, they make
whole movies on cell phones.

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:38.392
A lot of the work that we
did on "Back to the Future"

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:42.932
was straight, across the board,
special, mechanical effects,

01:12:43.234 --> 01:12:48.354
along with a small dose of pyro, and
a great amount of prop creation.

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:50.192
That stands up.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:53.825
Because a lot of times, we'll see
movies that are brilliantly clone,

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.986
the CG gets better and better
all the time,

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:59.122
but a lot of people enjoy
a taste of the real way.

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:00.873
And I think that's
one of the ways

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:03.375
that it still endears itself
to an audience.

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:06.584
-[Gale] When we were making Part
Two, we always used to say,

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:10.797
"Wow, in 2015, we'll all get
together and see what we got right."

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:12.460
We got a lot of stuff right.

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:15.881
- Yeah, you know, we did a pretty good job.
We hit about 50%.

01:13:16.183 --> 01:13:20.393
-[Gale] We got the flat-screen T\/s
and phone video conferencing right.

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:22.645
-[Clark]
The drones walking dogs.

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:26.274
-[Gale]
We got the Google glasses right.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:29.732
-[Clark] TVs with touchscreen and
hundreds of different channels.

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:34.275
-[Gale] We decided that what we were gonna
do was just have fun with the future.

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:36.409
We knew we weren't
gonna get it right.

01:13:36.704 --> 01:13:39.822
We knew that there weren't gonna be
flying cars. That we were sure of.

01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:42.866
- No one is ever gonna be
in a flying car.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:46.082
No one wants to fly in a car.
It's too scary.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:47.996
People are scared
to leave the ground.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.843
-[Man] People want flying cars.

01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:01.510
The limits of physics don't prevent
us from having flying cars.

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:05.851
The reasons that we don't have flying
cars today are really societal.

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:09.396
Aviation evolved
in a certain way,

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:11.185
and driving on the ground
evolved in a certain way.

01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:12.570
But these are all
human institutions.

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:15.152
These are human constructs,
so they can be changed.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:19.410
But we have to show people, hey, it
can actually be better than this,

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:23.243
and there is no physical law that we are
breaking to make it better than this.

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:26.330
We just have to show people, hey,
this is what it could be like.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:28.211
It could be a whole lot
better than it is today.

01:14:29.548 --> 01:14:32.131
Terrafugia is
a flying car company.

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:35.760
We're developing a practical
vision for the future

01:14:36.055 --> 01:14:39.138
and creating the path for how
to get from where we are today

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:42.175
to a world with flying cars
that anybody can use.

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:44.890
Growing up, I was definitely inspired
by movies like "Back to the Future"

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:50.480
and that vision of the DeLorean lifting
off and shooting over everybody.

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:53.145
And I was fascinated
with aviation

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:57.566
and trying to make practical
personal aviation.

01:14:57.868 --> 01:15:01.953
We have these images of people
flying in lanes and stuff like that.

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:05.661
Why would you fly in a lane if you've
got all this three-dimensional space?

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.997
You know, you need lanes
on the ground,

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:11.458
because you need to know where the
other cars are gonna be running,

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:14.340
so that you can have people playing
over here or something like that.

01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:17.923
Up in the air,
you don't need lanes, right?

01:15:18.222 --> 01:15:21.431
You need to know where all the other
aircraft are, and you need to avoid them.

01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:23.558
But you don't need
a lane of traffic

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.594
in order to know
where the other aircraft are.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:27.762
So I think the future
is gonna be a little different

01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:30.898
than it was laid out
in "Back to the Future,"

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:35.312
but the idea behind it
is the right idea,

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:36.729
and that's where we wanna go.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:39.115
- I need to borrow your...

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:40.775
hoverboard?

01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:45.242
- That was a true, total invention
of "Back to the Future ll."

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.498
But what's cool is that people
are trying to invent them now.

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:57.174
There's this old saying
that life imitates art.

01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:00.508
And the rocket scientist
Robert Goddard,

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:04.470
he always said that
what inspired him to do rocketry

01:16:04.769 --> 01:16:08.012
was reading Jules Verne's "From the
Earth to the Moon" when he was a kid.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:11.022
So, Bob and I cook up
this idea of hoverboards.

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:14.230
That's just a riff on our skateboard
chase from the first movie,

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:17.190
but, wow, does that capture
everybody's imagination.

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:21.950
The Hendo hoverboard, I saw that,
and I got so excited. Wow!

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:25.327
And it's working on magnetism,
which was the idea that we had.

01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:27.034
So how cool is that?

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:29.074
-[Greg Henderson] When you look
at the building industry,

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:31.743
the largest industry
in the U.S.,

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:34.834
it's a very difficult
thing to change.

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:37.043
But there's a better way
to build.

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:41.928
And so, in July of this year,
July of 2014,

01:16:42.223 --> 01:16:45.887
we had a patent issued for something
we've been working on for a long time.

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:48.722
And that is, essentially,
a three-part foundation system.

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:53.898
One of the key components of this
three-part foundation system

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:56.651
is something we call
the buffer medium.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:17:00.314
And that buffer medium can be
a liquid, it can be a gas,

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:04.735
and as we discovered, why not
an electromagnetic field?

01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:09.031
If you can hover a 50,000-kilogram
train, why not a house?

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:12.371
However, the new Maglev trains
in Japan, for instance,

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:15.879
have to be going 170 kilometers
per hour to levitate.

01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:18.790
There was no good way
to levitate a stationary object.

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:20.583
And so, started thinking.

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:24.504
What if you had a train that levitated,
and that train went in a circle?

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:28.391
Now, what if that train was
the same length as the track?

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:33.021
You essentially have a stationary
object relative to the earth,

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:34.851
and that was the first epiphany.

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:38.815
When you realize you oan hover a
dynamic load in a stationary position,

01:17:39.113 --> 01:17:41.605
something that has been
impossible up till now...

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:43.739
-[Jill Henderson] That's the
first thing that comes to mind.

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:45.866
-[Greg Henderson] What better
way to demonstrate this...

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:47.652
-[Jill Henderson]
ls a hoverboard? Absolutely.

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:52.324
- We got letters from kids all
over the world wanting to know,

01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:54.412
"Can I have a hoverboard?
Can I have one, please?"

01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:57.204
- Yeah, for a couple years when I was
young, I thought that thing was real.

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:58.996
Man, yeah, it really scarred me.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:03.760
- Well, that little behind the scenes
thing that was put out early on.

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:05.385
Robert Zemeckis saying,
"Oh, they're real,

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.046
"and the only reason
that we don't release them

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.010
"is parents don't think
they're gonna be very safe."

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:10.220
Or something like that.

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:11.805
That did affect
a lot of kids from the '80s.

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:14.971
- I remember seeing
the Zemeckis interview,

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:17.185
and he said
hoverboards were real.

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:18.895
-[Zemeckis]
They've been around for years.

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:22.733
Just the parents' groups have not
let toy manufacturers make them,

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:24.568
but we got our hands on some.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:26.904
- I remember being
with a couple of my friends

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:30.036
and saying, "Yeah, yeah,
I road a hoverboard."

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:32.493
And they were all like,
"No, you didn't."

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:35.328
And I said, "Nope, it's true.
I road a hoverboard."

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:37.335
- Wait.
Are you serious right now?

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.713
- True story. I was walking through the
mall, and a scientist walked up to me,

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:42.919
a real Doc Brown type,

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:46.553
and he asked if I wanted to be in a select
group of kids to test hoverboard technology.

01:18:46.847 --> 01:18:48.303
- Yeah, I call bullcrap.

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:51.136
- It was really not fun
doing the hoverboard.

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:53.142
- What you gotta do
is you gotta aim it.

01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:54.643
You gotta kind of pop it
on an arc.

01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:56.054
- Qkay_
'Qkay?

01:18:57.316 --> 01:18:58.056
- Ready?
- Ready

01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:01.776
- That's perfect. Like that.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:05.359
-[Zemec:kis] We didn't have
computer-generated images in those days,

01:19:05.658 --> 01:19:08.195
and we had to have
actors hanging on wires.

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:09.780
And the wires
had to be really thin,

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.820
'cause you couldn't
graft them out on the computer.

01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:14.614
You had to hid them
from the camera.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:16.328
And it was really
time-consuming,

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:18.618
and it was really, really,
difficult to do.

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:21.629
-[Fox] I mean, people think
that it looked so smooth,

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:25.337
but I this thing stapled to my foot,
and I was dangling from wires.

01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:28.173
- Anyone who's probably, like,

01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:31.134
I don't know unless their parents
show them "Back to the Future,"

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.265
if it's an important movie
to them, they1lseeiL

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.177
I know that Sean's parents love
the movie and showed it to him,

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.720
so he was very familiar with it.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:40.185
I don't know that he has that
passion for it that I did.

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:43.226
What he loved was watching
the hoverboarding videos

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:46.442
and getting to do that scene where
he's up in the tree hoverboarding.

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.606
- Yippee! Here I am,

01:19:48.909 --> 01:19:51.742
testing out the world's first
actual hover...

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:54.369
Ow! Ow! It's squishing my parts.

01:19:54.665 --> 01:19:56.326
- He was really excited
to do that.

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.161
I mean, you know, anyone
wants to ride a hoverboard.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.167
It's a fantasy everyone wants
to live, and he got to do it.

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.042
It's pretty amazing.

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:03.830
- May 31, 2013,

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:08.923
and you're looking at the world's
first ridable hoverboard.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:10.711
- Well, the first ride,
it was pretty amazing,

01:20:11.015 --> 01:20:13.882
because we were in our kitchen, and
we had to literally chain it down,

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:16.050
because we had no idea

01:20:16.353 --> 01:20:21.314
how powerful this beast
of a hoverboard was.

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.234
- All right, it's hovering, guys.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:38.869
-[cheering]

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:43.874
-[.Jill Henderson] It was one of those
moments where I felt like I was 1 C).

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:49.009
I mean, it was one of those really
powerful moments of what was yet to oome.

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:50.384
It was just the beginning.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.795
- See, that chokes me up.
- It does.

01:20:57.478 --> 01:21:00.516
- Okay, check the ESCs.
I'm gonna keep rolling here.

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:02.725
Unbelievable, Jill.
How the [beep] was that?

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:06.313
-[Greg Henderson] It was clunky, very
clunky. It was not so attractive,

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:07.477
but it worked.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:12.445
If we can keep
taking care of each other,

01:21:12.743 --> 01:21:16.907
and allowing this extra time
and energy to dare to wonder.

01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:19.910
It's a great time to be alive.

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.416
Wouldn't trade it
for any other time in history.

01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:33.381
-[Zemeckis] Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
do "Back to the Future" anymore.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.796
Three is enough. You know,
three is a good number.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:39.434
- After Bob and I made
the third movie,

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:41.810
we actually had t-shirts made up

01:21:42.106 --> 01:21:44.643
that had
"Back to the Future lV"

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:47.684
with a circle and slash
through the roman numeral four.

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:51.149
We'd said what we wanted to say. We'd done
what we wanted to do with the characters.

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:55.191
And if we went back
to the well another time,

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:57.531
it'd be kind of
an act of prostitution, really.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:59.412
- Three is a dramatic number.

01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:04.075
You know, it's the trinity.
It's the three-act structure.

01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:06.540
Four is a boring number.

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.831
You know, it's bland. It's even.

01:22:10.134 --> 01:22:11.340
There's no drama in four.

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:14.753
- Sometimes, I'm asked if
they ever came up with a Iv,

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:16.671
"Back to the Future IV,"
would I still do it?

01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:18.764
You bet.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:20.842
Totally.

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:25.851
- Oh, I'll do I, ll, Ill, IV, V,
whatever it...

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:27.732
What could be bad, you know?

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:29.437
But I don't think
they ever should.

01:22:29.736 --> 01:22:32.148
- Someb0dy might do it. I mean,
maybe somebody after I'm dead...

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:34.815
Universal could maybe...
or if my kids...

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:37.233
if my kids need to make money

01:22:37.536 --> 01:22:44.249
and Wanna have Universal,
you know, do the movie

01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:46.580
with some new concept
or something,

01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:48.165
I guess they'll do it.

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:49.875
But it's nothing
I'm interested in.

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:52.381
- Yes, people keep asking
for more.

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:55.885
So, we did the telltale game,

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.545
which was pretty good.

01:22:57.848 --> 01:23:02.263
It pretty nicely captures the
energy of the movies, I think.

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:07.806
And Bob and I had started kicking
around, oh, almost 1 O years ago,

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:12.978
the idea of putting
"Back to the Future"

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:17.990
on Broadway, or in the West End, or
someplace to do a musical production of it.

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:20.993
- I think all of us want,

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:26.324
first and foremost, to adhere
to the Hippocratic oath,

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:28.459
and do no harm.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:34.340
So we're very... You know, we're looking
very carefully at how to proceed with this,

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:39.971
because "Back to the Future"
deserves the best we know...

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.424
you know, the best we can do.

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:46.094
And we wanna really make sure

01:23:46.396 --> 01:23:49.479
that what we do in that capacity

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:53.769
adds to, again, the legacy
of "Back to the Future."

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:02.910
- What about all that talk

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:07.039
about screwing up future events,
the space-time continuum?

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:10.618
- Well, I figured, what the hell?

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:14.130
- There comes a time
in every child's life

01:24:14.424 --> 01:24:20.090
when he truly understands
that adults were once kids,

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.881
that his parents
were once children.

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:27.723
Seven, eight, nine,
ten years old, it clicks.

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:31.685
You realize, "Oh, my god. I'm
gonna grow up to be an adult,

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:35.443
"which means that my adult
parents were once children too."

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.899
{Thompson} The idea that
your parents were once young

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:41.691
and had the same dreams that you
are gonna have or have right now,

01:24:41.994 --> 01:24:44.782
and that we're all just people, and
we all still feel young at heart.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.289
-[Gale] And that's what
"Back to the Future" is about,

01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:50.166
that sudden realization,

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:53.578
that idea that
your infallible parents,

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.962
who you think are infallible
when you're a little kid,

01:24:56.258 --> 01:24:58.590
they were gawky teenagers,

01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:01.547
and fumbled around in a car, and didn't
know what the hell they were doing.

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:05.556
And that resonates
through all generations

01:25:05.851 --> 01:25:07.012
and through every culture
in the world.

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:09.848
That's why the movie
is a big hit everywhere.

01:25:10.147 --> 01:25:13.731
-[Dean Cundey] The appeal to "Back
to the Future" for me, of course,

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:20.147
but also for an audience, is the fact that
it was such an interesting look at...

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:22.907
I guess you'd call it
wish fulfillment,

01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:27.695
which is who wouldn't wanna go
back in time and fix something?

01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:32.333
- Fl'hompson] I think when George McFly has
the courage to punch Biff at that moment,

01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:35.165
I think that moment
was so perfectly constructed.

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:37.671
I think we all wonder
about that.

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:39.707
If we would have done something
different at one moment,

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:43.719
would it have changed our whole lives
for the better or for the worse?

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:46.597
- Now, 3O years later, you look
back at a project like this,

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:52.683
and you try to remember just what
your part in all of this was.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:55.598
And it's just
a pretty small part.

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:58.393
I mean, yeah, the car is
featured in all of these scenes,

01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:00.106
and it's used,
and it's cherished,

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:01.770
and plastic models
are made of it.

01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:04.736
It's nice being a part of that.

01:26:05.035 --> 01:26:06.992
- Well, the movie is just...

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:11.326
you know, the movie defines the taste
of buttered popcorn. It really does.

01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:14.333
- We actually use the same logic

01:26:14.628 --> 01:26:17.120
when we go to see movies
as we do walking into a casino.

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:20.960
We largely know
we're gonna get ripped off,

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:23.000
but the chance is worth it.

01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:26.421
If it were any other industry, we
would have long ago shut it down

01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:28.384
and sued everybody.

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:30.391
Because if it was cans of tuna,

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:34.771
the equivalent would be like every
third can had a human finger in it.

01:26:35.065 --> 01:26:36.476
Movies are so bad now.

01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:38.857
And they're allowed to be,

01:26:39.152 --> 01:26:41.689
because that's how good
"Back to the Future" was.

01:26:42.906 --> 01:26:44.146
- It's just
one of those things, man.

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:46.235
You know, it's one of
those things that worked.

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:47.445
It just worked.

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:49.701
- So how far ahead are you going?

01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:52.988
- About 30 years.
It's a nice, round number.

01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:55.373
- Look me up
when you get there, all right?

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:57.376
I guess I'll be about 47.

01:26:57.671 --> 01:26:58.581
- I will.

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:02.878
- Take care.
- You, too.

01:27:03.176 --> 01:27:05.258
- All right.
Bye bye, Einie.

01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:07.420
Oh, and watch that re-entry.

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:09.009
It's a little bumpy.

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:09.967
- You bet.

01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:28.653
- To the future!

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.666
-[Dr. Brown] All right, Marty, you all set?
- YÃ©ah,yeah,go!

01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:44.377
- There are so many places I would
like to see if I had a time machine.

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:46.258
Every era, I would love to see.

01:27:46.553 --> 01:27:48.260
And I am so lucky.

01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:50.592
I have been able to
a lot on film.

01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:52.381
- Boy, if I can go
anywhere in time,

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:53.640
you know where
I would probably go?

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:58.600
I would go back to maybe
the MGM auction of 1970,

01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:01.231
and I would hopefully be able
to go back there

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:03.733
with 10 or $20,000
in my back pocket.

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:07.147
And I'd buy all the stuff that I keep
hearing over the years went for nothing.

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:11.443
- Well, it depends
what the time travel rules are.

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:12.860
You know, I mean...

01:28:14.498 --> 01:28:18.787
I guess if I could
only go one way,

01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:20.450
I would go in the future.

01:28:20.754 --> 01:28:23.121
- I think about 10,000 years in
the future might be interesting.

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:28.042
- I probably wanna go
into the future

01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:29.801
about four and a half weeks
right now.

01:28:30.096 --> 01:28:34.135
Because I'm writing
on a film right now,

01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:37.017
and I'm working really hard.

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:40.225
And about four and a half weeks
from now, I think I'll be finished.

01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:42.982
- I don't know
if you've ever seen "Henry V,"

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:44.983
Olivier's "Henry V."

01:28:46.112 --> 01:28:48.649
All the backstage activity,

01:28:48.949 --> 01:28:52.408
people throwing things from
the groundings who'd paid...

01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:56.445
the re-writes going on.

01:28:56.748 --> 01:29:01.914
It would have been kind of cool to go
back, be an observer of that today.

01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:05.045
- I was doing a TV movie
with Woody Allen,

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.753
and we were talking, as always
happens to me on sets and stuff,

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:10.634
people ask me that question.

01:29:10.929 --> 01:29:15.218
So we were in a full-fledged discussion
about where we would go in time.

01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:20.683
And Woody Allen was normally
preoccupied with other things,

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:22.471
but he was listening to us.

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:26.859
And so someone summoned up the courage
to ask him where he would go,

01:29:27.153 --> 01:29:30.362
and he said, "No time before
the invention of penicillin."

01:29:30.657 --> 01:29:32.864
I always thought that
was a good rule of thumb.

01:29:33.159 --> 01:29:36.368
But I would think...
-[car alarm blaring]

01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:38.279
- Sometime before car alarms.

01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:41.449
- I think I would rather go back
in time than forward in time.

01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:44.209
Because I think
when you go forward in time,

01:29:44.504 --> 01:29:45.869
it's gonna be disastrous.

01:29:46.172 --> 01:29:49.085
- There's your 10-year-old,
horny self

01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:55.471
that remembers that in the '80s,
women were the most beautiful.

01:29:57.517 --> 01:30:02.512
When I think about femininity,
and sexuality, and music,

01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:07.900
and all the things that make a
little kid squirm and feel alive,

01:30:08.194 --> 01:30:09.434
I think of the '80s.

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:11.445
And so, I would wanna
revisit that time.

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:15.779
- I'm a big in the moment guy. I like
right now. I've always liked right now.

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:18.068
I've never yearned
for times in the past.

01:30:18.371 --> 01:30:20.578
We have all that information.
We can watch all the movies.

01:30:20.874 --> 01:30:23.536
But the future.
Yeah, it's gotta be the future.

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:25.872
You gotta go past
when you're gonna die

01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:27.878
and see how we kill ourselves,
right?

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:32.041
- You know, if you're curious, you've
gotta say, "How does this all work out?

01:30:32.344 --> 01:30:34.506
"What happens with humanity?

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:38.388
"What's the next iPhone like?"

01:30:38.683 --> 01:30:39.844
You know,
all those important things.

01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:42.430
- I'd like to travel
'I00 years into the future.

01:30:42.729 --> 01:30:45.517
Because just looking back
at what has evolved

01:30:45.815 --> 01:30:48.807
and what's happened over the
past 1 O0 years is mind-blowing.

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:51.147
So I only need to go
'I00 years into the future

01:30:51.446 --> 01:30:54.359
to see some amazing things.

01:30:54.658 --> 01:30:57.275
I really...
I'm gonna sound like a crackpot,

01:30:57.577 --> 01:31:02.447
but I really believe that, because so many
things have been transmitted digitally now,

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:04.160
over the past 100 years,

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:09.124
I think there's a real possibility
of some sort of teleportation.

01:31:09.422 --> 01:31:13.256
Physical matter being transmitted
in some kind of digital form.

01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:14.882
And I know that sounds crazy,

01:31:15.178 --> 01:31:17.465
but everything does
before it happens.

01:31:17.764 --> 01:31:20.756
- Then there's the objective
kind of like fascination.

01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:23.721
I think I'd like to go back
to the 1920s.

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:30.733
'Cause it seemed like
such a crazy, historic...

01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:35.942
simultaneously gritty and pretentious
kind of culture. I don't know.

01:31:36.241 --> 01:31:37.697
I'd get to wear a hat.

01:31:37.993 --> 01:31:39.404
I could probably wear a hat now.

01:31:40.578 --> 01:31:42.819
But it makes me nervous.

01:31:43.123 --> 01:31:45.160
- If there's an opportunity
to tweak things

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:47.665
and not upset
the space-time continuum,

01:31:47.961 --> 01:31:51.704
I could go back and bitch-slap
a couple people. I don't know.

01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:56.217
[crew member laughing]

01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:59.879

the Future" theme playing]
