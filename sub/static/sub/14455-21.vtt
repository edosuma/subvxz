00:12.233 --> 00:15.033
Narrator: Coming up,
Why is Joe getting frisky?

00:15.033 --> 00:16.233
These are sexy beasts.

00:17.900 --> 00:20.567
What's got Murr
dishing out the insults?

00:20.567 --> 00:22.467
You look like
a slutty carrot.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.067
And which losing Joker
will be under fire

00:27.067 --> 00:30.033
in tonight's
silent

00:31.333 --> 00:34.033
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.167
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:36.733 --> 00:38.133
Murr: I want my mommy!

00:40.233 --> 00:42.867
Sal: I will never forgive you!

00:42.867 --> 00:44.500
Joe: Larry!

00:49.600 --> 00:52.067
Today, we are Focus Plus
competing head-to-head

00:52.067 --> 00:54.167
as toy designers
asking the group,

00:54.167 --> 00:55.400
"Who has the better toys?"

00:55.400 --> 00:57.967
Except our toys are
completely ridiculous

00:57.967 --> 00:59.433
and have been designed
by the other guys.

00:59.433 --> 01:02.067
At the end, we will ask
the group by show of hands

01:02.067 --> 01:04.400
who amongst us is
the better toy designer.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.300
If the people don't
pick you, you lose.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.367
**

01:10.367 --> 01:12.067
Q, I don't know
how you did this, but...

01:12.067 --> 01:13.167
it's heavy back here.

01:13.167 --> 01:14.300
Yeah.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.467
I'm surprised you
didn't dye it, though.

01:15.467 --> 01:17.100
There's a little bit
of grey there.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.900
Well, I'm not gonna deny
the aging process.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.200
I don't even like working out
or getting my body in shape.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.867
Let's just age.

01:22.867 --> 01:24.167
-Correct.
-Yeah.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.833
-Welcome. Welcome.
-Hello. Pleasure.

01:25.833 --> 01:28.700
So, Joe made Murray's toy,
Murray made Joe's toy?

01:28.700 --> 01:29.367
Correct.

01:29.367 --> 01:30.067
What we do is we

01:30.067 --> 01:31.100
test out new products

01:31.100 --> 01:31.967
that we're thinking of bringing

01:31.967 --> 01:33.333
to market for children.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.933
-Okay. Here we go, Joe.
-So, this is mine here.

01:35.933 --> 01:38.700
This...

01:41.300 --> 01:43.167
These are Sexy Beasts.

01:44.833 --> 01:47.533
I got the idea because my
daughter put my wife's lingerie

01:47.533 --> 01:49.067
on her stuffies.
And then, you know,

01:49.067 --> 01:50.300
there's something
for the ladies too,

01:50.300 --> 01:52.333
'cause you could just
have a raccoon with abs.

01:54.067 --> 01:57.100
So obviously,
the walrus has huge jugs.

01:59.700 --> 02:04.067
And the kangaroo is more
of a leg-and-back situation.

02:04.067 --> 02:06.367
Are these marketed
towards adults?

02:06.367 --> 02:08.633
This is for children,
bought by adults.

02:08.633 --> 02:09.633
No.

02:09.633 --> 02:11.133
Sorry?

02:11.133 --> 02:12.233
No.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.533
You gotta think --
it's 2-k-17 now.

02:13.533 --> 02:14.933
You have to jump
off the shelves,

02:14.933 --> 02:16.633
and that's what we're trying
to do here with Sexy Beasts.

02:16.633 --> 02:17.800
This is a lawsuit,
dude.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.200
You think this is
a lawsuit?

02:19.200 --> 02:20.600
Why don't you show them the
commercial for Sexy Beasts?

02:20.600 --> 02:22.133
Oh. Yeah. I can't wait
till you see this one.

02:24.467 --> 02:26.867
**

02:26.867 --> 02:28.400
Woman:
Babe-A-Roo.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.533
Hard-Bodied Raccoon.

02:35.567 --> 02:37.267
Mother Coconuts.

02:40.933 --> 02:43.333
Hot Toys.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.900
-Oy.

02:45.900 --> 02:46.933
How does this happen?

02:46.933 --> 02:48.067
Mother Coconuts?

02:50.100 --> 02:52.233
A for effort, but
this is a terrible idea.

02:52.233 --> 02:54.267
A for effort,
but terrible idea. Okay.

02:55.567 --> 02:58.100
Okay, so...my item...

02:58.100 --> 03:01.767
Let's take a look
at what this is.

03:01.767 --> 03:03.867
Right here.
Aha!

03:03.867 --> 03:06.200
This is...

03:06.200 --> 03:09.233
It's a pregnant belly
for children.

03:09.233 --> 03:13.167
It's for future
single moms, okay?

03:13.167 --> 03:14.667
Q: Nice one, Joey.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.833
Oh, okay.
Oh, there it is.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.500
Now, this is a prototype.
Okay.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.767
Uhh... So what this is is it--
it's for little girls

03:23.767 --> 03:26.133
that are going to be future
single moms one day.

03:27.567 --> 03:28.867
My daughter, for example,

03:28.867 --> 03:31.533
she loves to play
single-mom-with-one-on-the-way.

03:31.533 --> 03:33.600
Now she can let her
imagination run wild

03:33.600 --> 03:35.900
and actually experience
what it's like to --

03:35.900 --> 03:38.067
to be with child
for nine months.

03:40.267 --> 03:42.633
We did go Caucasian
with the bump, but --

03:42.633 --> 03:45.467
but it could be, obviously...

03:46.733 --> 03:49.667
He points to the black guy.

03:49.667 --> 03:52.233
-Well, show them the commercial.
-Uh, so we have a commercial.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.933
Yeah.

03:53.933 --> 03:59.800
**

04:03.300 --> 04:05.533
-There. Pregnancy Belly.

04:05.533 --> 04:06.567
Yeah, that's it.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.200
You want to walk arou--
see seven-year-old

04:10.200 --> 04:11.733
pregnant girls, really?

04:11.733 --> 04:14.167
Seriously, how do you see
that on Christmas day?

04:14.167 --> 04:16.600
Yeah, that's a good point.
No, he's got a point there.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.633
It's machine-washable.
And it's got Velcro.

04:21.900 --> 04:24.133
Uh, if we had to take
one of these two to market,

04:24.133 --> 04:25.900
who would say to bring the, uh,

04:25.900 --> 04:27.433
pregnant belly
for kids to market,

04:27.433 --> 04:29.667
by show of hands?

04:29.667 --> 04:31.067
Who thinks we should
choose Sexy Beasts?

04:31.067 --> 04:32.533
Hands up.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.867
-Ohh!
-Ohhh! Blowout.

04:34.867 --> 04:36.433
Yeah, yeah.
That's a closeout.

04:36.433 --> 04:37.233
Son of a...

04:41.767 --> 04:43.667
-Here we go.
-We develop toys.

04:43.667 --> 04:46.633
And we're deciding which one
we might move forward

04:46.633 --> 04:48.300
in developing
and going to market with.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.067
All right, Sal.
What's your toy?

04:50.067 --> 04:51.600
Uh, I'll help you.
I'll pull it out for you.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.633
Q has designed this toy
for Sal.

04:53.633 --> 04:56.367
This is really exciting.
This is next level, guys.

04:56.367 --> 04:57.900
-Let me see.
-Oh yeah.

04:57.900 --> 04:58.867
You really
outdid yourself.

04:58.867 --> 05:00.500
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow!

05:00.500 --> 05:02.733
-Okay. Oh, wow.
-Boom.

05:02.733 --> 05:06.067
Murr:
It's a toilet with guns on it.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.867
We call this
Toilet Soldiers.

05:08.867 --> 05:11.700
And this can make
any standard-sized toilet

05:11.700 --> 05:13.700
into a whole entire
military base.

05:16.067 --> 05:18.467
You want children
to play with a toilet.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.667
Sal:
It actually is ergonomically
the perfect battle station.

05:21.667 --> 05:23.233
**

05:23.233 --> 05:24.833
There you go.

05:24.833 --> 05:27.500
This is...if the kid
is also on the toilet,

05:27.500 --> 05:29.567
"I'm in here.
Don't come in!" Boom!

05:29.567 --> 05:31.333
Shoots the gun at the door,
like kinda thing.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.500
So it's combining privacy --

05:33.500 --> 05:35.767
it's making it more
masculine, more fun.

05:35.767 --> 05:37.533
What happens if the boy
takes the G.I. Joe,

05:37.533 --> 05:38.867
pretends he goes up
the ladder,

05:38.867 --> 05:41.367
sticks his hand in the dirty
toilet water and does all that?

05:41.367 --> 05:43.967
-Ooh.
-Okay so, we -- I...

05:43.967 --> 05:46.433
I envision
that the child would play

05:46.433 --> 05:50.067
before the making.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.867
But that's not how
it's always gonna happen.

05:51.867 --> 05:53.933
Kids do whatever they want.

05:53.933 --> 05:55.667
I will tell you.
We showed this to children,

05:55.667 --> 05:57.933
and their eyes lit up.

05:57.933 --> 06:01.167
That's fine. But you got
to think about the dirty water.

06:01.167 --> 06:02.867
Joe: This guy is all over Sal.

06:02.867 --> 06:04.933
You still got the,
uh, the ladder?

06:04.933 --> 06:06.667
-Yes.
-Okay. So they're gonna

06:06.667 --> 06:08.700
bring in their own soldier
and climb the ladder

06:08.700 --> 06:10.267
and, "Oh, let's see
if he can swim."

06:10.267 --> 06:12.067
The ladder opens up
and, guess what?

06:12.067 --> 06:13.933
"Look, there's water. He could
go swimming in the water."

06:13.933 --> 06:15.133
Okay. So the ladder...

06:15.133 --> 06:16.433
I would remove the ladder.

06:16.433 --> 06:17.700
I'll move -- move --
move -- the ladder!

06:19.767 --> 06:21.700
You know what? Why don't you
show them the commercial?

06:21.700 --> 06:22.600
Yeah, let's see
the commercial.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.867
Got...
I got a commercial, huh?

06:23.867 --> 06:26.233
Yes.
Okay. Here we go.

06:26.233 --> 06:27.900
* Da-da-da da-da-da

06:27.900 --> 06:29.467
* Toilet Soldiers!

06:29.467 --> 06:30.967
* Da-da-da da-da-da
* Toilet Soldiers!

06:30.967 --> 06:32.833
* Toilet Soldiiieeeerrrs
* Toilet Soldiers!

06:32.833 --> 06:34.733
See?

06:34.733 --> 06:36.233
-Ohh!
-Oh, no!

06:36.233 --> 06:37.467
-No!
-Oh, no!

06:39.100 --> 06:40.567
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no!

06:40.567 --> 06:42.133
-They're playing in the toilet.
-That's not good!

06:42.133 --> 06:44.200
They're flushing
the guys down the toilet.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.500
Sal.
He knows he has no shot!

06:47.500 --> 06:50.600
-Survey says, "Ennnnh!".
-Survey says "Enh." Okay.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.567
-Well, you haven't seen his yet.
-Can't wait.

06:52.567 --> 06:54.833
Okay.
Yes. I love this one.

06:54.833 --> 06:57.067
Okay. I think you guys
are gonna like this, too.

06:57.067 --> 06:58.733
So, Sal designed
this for Q.

06:58.733 --> 06:59.800
Joe: Yes.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.767
This is the, uh,
Sister Tracker Spy Kit.

07:02.767 --> 07:05.633
All right? Everybody
knows, uh, you know,

07:05.633 --> 07:07.767
rivalry between
brother and sister.

07:07.767 --> 07:10.900
It's worldwide. We want to
give the edge to the boys.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.433
And in doing so,
we want to be able to track

07:13.433 --> 07:15.633
their sister at all times.

07:15.633 --> 07:17.500
**

07:17.500 --> 07:20.100
Hey...
Toilet's not so bad, huh?

07:25.633 --> 07:27.367
This little gun...

07:27.367 --> 07:29.533
you can be able to hear
anything your sister says.

07:30.933 --> 07:33.333
Oh, is sister in the pool
with her friends?

07:33.333 --> 07:35.067
Well, let me just see
what's going on there.

07:36.133 --> 07:37.300
You weirdo!

07:37.300 --> 07:39.100
You're making it creepier
than you have to!

07:39.100 --> 07:40.400
You have a jingle.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.700
Uh, we -- we did, like,
a little marketing jingle.

07:41.700 --> 07:42.733
Yes, we did.

07:42.733 --> 07:43.733
So this is the jingle,

07:43.733 --> 07:45.067
just to bring it all home.

07:45.067 --> 07:47.267
* What is she doing?
* Sister Tracker

07:47.267 --> 07:49.733
* Where is she going?
* Sister Tracker

07:49.733 --> 07:51.933
* What's she wearing?
* Sister Tracker

07:51.933 --> 07:54.400
* Who's she kissing?
* Sister Tracker

07:54.400 --> 07:56.767
* Sister in the shower
* Where's your sister?

07:56.767 --> 07:59.200
* Sister in the bedroom
* Where's your sister?

07:59.200 --> 08:01.667
* She's a good girl
* Sister Tracker

08:01.667 --> 08:04.800
* Should've had boys
* Yeah

08:04.800 --> 08:06.700
-Ha-ha!

08:06.700 --> 08:08.567
How would you feel
if that was your sister?

08:08.567 --> 08:11.167
No, no. I created this
with my sister in mind.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.400
Based on everything
you saw here today,

08:15.400 --> 08:18.167
who thinks I have
the better idea?

08:18.167 --> 08:21.133
And who thinks Brian
had the better toy?

08:23.900 --> 08:27.367
Yeah, but if something bad
happens to your sister,

08:27.367 --> 08:29.067
who's the hero
that's tracking her down?

08:30.300 --> 08:31.767
-Sal loses!
-That's it!

08:31.767 --> 08:34.367
NARRATOR: Sal and Murr's toys
got sent back to the workshop,

08:34.367 --> 08:37.200
so they're first up
on the loser board.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.867
Today, we're
approaching strangers,

08:38.867 --> 08:41.433
trying to get approval on an
important e-mail we're writing.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.867
The catch is, the other
guys have written

08:42.867 --> 08:45.333
this ridiculous e-mail for us,
and we don't get to see it

08:45.333 --> 08:46.733
until the moment
we open it to read it.

08:46.733 --> 08:48.733
If they don't agree that
that e-mail is ready

08:48.733 --> 08:51.267
to send as is,
you lose.

08:51.267 --> 08:52.933
Put that in your ea--

08:52.933 --> 08:55.167
You messed up your one --
he messed up his one line.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.167
One line!

08:56.167 --> 09:00.233
**

09:00.233 --> 09:02.900
Murr: This is amazing.
This is the best location
we've ever filmed at.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.167
Joe: It's an indoor park.
Yeah.

09:04.167 --> 09:05.967
It's cool,
air-conditioned.

09:05.967 --> 09:07.167
Unbelievable.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.533
What's

09:08.533 --> 09:10.900
It's a mixture of banana, mango,
pineapple juice.

09:10.900 --> 09:11.933
Ohhh.

09:11.933 --> 09:12.833
There's free --
this guy walks around

09:12.833 --> 09:13.933
and gives you
free smoothies.

09:13.933 --> 09:15.067
Free smoothies.
Free smoothie samples.

09:15.067 --> 09:16.367
Sal: Get the
out of here.

09:16.367 --> 09:19.100
Pete, we're filming here
all the  time.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.833
Oh, my God!
There's hair in my...

09:21.833 --> 09:22.600
from Q's hair!

09:22.600 --> 09:23.533
It's about  time.

09:23.533 --> 09:27.300
Look at this!
It's in my lo mein!

09:27.300 --> 09:31.667
-Here we go.
-Here we go.

09:31.667 --> 09:33.167
Excuse me.

09:33.167 --> 09:35.633
Can I ask your opinion
on something real quick?

09:35.633 --> 09:37.167
Thanks. I'm just trying
to send this e-mail.

09:37.167 --> 09:38.300
I don't if
it's good to go.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.833
Before I hit send,
I just wanted to get

09:39.833 --> 09:40.967
another person's opinion.

09:40.967 --> 09:42.067
Here we go.

09:42.067 --> 09:45.400
It's to, uh, step-daughter's
principal.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.933
Uh-hah.

09:46.933 --> 09:49.200
"Thanks again for meeting
with me and my step-daughter.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.767
We both learned a lot
about what is and isn't
allowed in schools today.

09:53.767 --> 09:58.433
I hope the 'Asian-American'
student in Alex's class" --

09:58.433 --> 10:00.133
that's my step-daughter --
"returns soon.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.600
I know that in our day,
it would've been okay to say

10:02.600 --> 10:05.333
what Alex said, but the times
they are a-changin'.

10:05.333 --> 10:09.067
Growing up, I'd often
get called a shylock,

10:09.067 --> 10:10.433
and I'm not even
a 'Jewish.'

10:11.567 --> 10:14.367
Thanks again for time,
and stay 'black'."

10:19.167 --> 10:23.800
Yeah, he's black.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.867
"I have no idea
what to say to you."

10:28.967 --> 10:32.167
Well, what's the PC
way to say that?

10:33.867 --> 10:37.400
So not ready
to send as

10:37.400 --> 10:39.900
-Ahh!
-All right! Loser!

10:39.900 --> 10:41.367
You can't say anything.
All right.

10:46.867 --> 10:49.367
Q: Look at him.
Where you lookin', Joe?

10:49.367 --> 10:51.100
Where you lookin'?
-Look at your face!

10:54.967 --> 10:57.133
Let me ask you something.
I'm about to send this e-mail.

10:57.133 --> 10:59.033
I just wanted your opinion, too.
You seem like a smart guy.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.600
It says, "Aunt June...

11:00.600 --> 11:02.833
I'm sorry but you
can't baby-sit anymore.

11:02.833 --> 11:04.767
We hid a camera
in the teddy bear's eye.

11:04.767 --> 11:07.333
We say you eat
the crayons.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.667
How could you blame it
on the dog?

11:08.667 --> 11:10.333
We had to put her
down for that."

11:11.467 --> 11:13.933
Why did you put down
the dog for eating crayons?

11:13.933 --> 11:16.067
In hindsight, it might've
been way too much

11:16.067 --> 11:17.567
of a punishment
for the dog.

11:17.567 --> 11:19.267
Yeah.

11:19.267 --> 11:21.933
Do you think this spells out
everything correctly?

11:24.067 --> 11:25.300
Oh, no. She's got
her wits about her.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.067
Yeah. She's fine.
She's -- yeah, yeah.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.100
But she enjoys
a good crayon.

11:30.267 --> 11:31.533
"Okay."

11:31.533 --> 11:32.667
So I want her to know
the whole scope.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.067
Do you think that
everything is --

11:34.067 --> 11:35.433
-"It sounds fine."

11:35.433 --> 11:36.833
There you go!

11:36.833 --> 11:38.833
Probably shouldn't
have put the dog down.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.867
Very good!

11:42.867 --> 11:44.800
You know what? Let me
ask you -- excuse me.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.733
Do you have one second?

11:45.733 --> 11:46.400
Yeah.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.600
Here we go.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.067
I'm writing an e-mail.
I'm about to hit send.

11:49.067 --> 11:50.967
And I just want to run it by
one other person

11:50.967 --> 11:52.733
before I send it, 'cause it's
like, if the tone is right.

11:52.733 --> 11:54.467
And I just want to run it by
one other person -"D.

11:54.467 --> 11:56.367
I'm so freaking good
at karate now,

11:56.367 --> 11:57.567
and it's not even funny.

11:57.567 --> 11:59.267
But you still laugh at me
when I show you

11:59.267 --> 12:00.833
my karate moves,
so I'm done.

12:00.833 --> 12:03.933
I'm done. I want a divorce,
and I want the kids.

12:03.933 --> 12:07.467
Challenge me...

12:07.467 --> 12:10.067
and you'll discover
just how good I am

12:10.067 --> 12:11.800
at doing karate
to people."

12:13.633 --> 12:16.733
Doing karate to people.

12:16.733 --> 12:18.700
Yeah,
but just to scare her.

12:20.200 --> 12:24.133
For six years,
I've been taking karate.

12:24.133 --> 12:26.967
Taekwondo.

12:26.967 --> 12:29.467
I was a p-- purple.

12:29.467 --> 12:30.433
Six.

12:30.433 --> 12:32.267
Are you a martial artist?
You...

12:32.267 --> 12:33.400
Q: Ohh!

12:33.400 --> 12:34.567
You practice martial arts?

12:34.567 --> 12:36.267
-Yeah.

12:36.267 --> 12:38.967
So then you know
that six years...

12:38.967 --> 12:42.833
it's not possible?

12:44.500 --> 12:46.067
He's laughing
in your face.

12:46.067 --> 12:48.133
What belt are you?

12:48.133 --> 12:50.133
Dark blue? Where is...
where, um --

12:50.133 --> 12:51.133
Yeah, I know what
you're talking about.

12:51.133 --> 12:51.967
-Yeah.
-Yeah, right.

12:51.967 --> 12:53.700
Sal...

12:53.700 --> 12:55.300
Can I -- can I send
the e

12:55.300 --> 12:58.300
Do you think
that's fine?

12:58.300 --> 12:59.633
You wouldn't send it.

13:04.467 --> 13:05.933
I knew that.

13:05.933 --> 13:07.433
He corrected his bow!

13:07.433 --> 13:09.933
-He didn't give the bow right!
-He can't even bow!

13:13.133 --> 13:15.067
How you doin'?

13:15.067 --> 13:18.500
Good. How are you?
Do you work here?

13:18.500 --> 13:19.800
Oh, sweet.
What do you do?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.567
-Murray's in.
-Oh, cool.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.800
Yeah, I live, like,
three blocks away.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.833
Murr's really looking
to make a friend.

13:25.833 --> 13:27.400
It's just an internship
for the summer, so...

13:27.400 --> 13:29.500
Oh, cool. What's, uh --
what kind of company?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.200
See if he wants to go
to "Aladdin" tonight.

13:33.067 --> 13:35.067
Everybody else on the crew
was a hard pass.

13:35.067 --> 13:37.333
Murray's ordering tickets
for "Aladdin" tonight,

13:37.333 --> 13:40.067
to go see the Broadway play,
and he just sourced everybody,

13:40.067 --> 13:41.633
got a big fat goose egg.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.867
"Does anyone of our crew of 60
want to go with me

13:45.867 --> 13:47.267
to a Broadway play?"

13:47.267 --> 13:50.067
"I'll pay.
No?"

13:50.067 --> 13:51.833
Do you mind if I run --
I'm writing an e-mail.

13:51.833 --> 13:54.067
Do you mind if I run it by you,
to see if it's the right tone?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.433
-Go for it.
-Okay.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.833
I wrote, you know, "Darlene,
you are my wife and I love you.

13:57.833 --> 14:00.067
But come on with
the spray tans.

14:00.067 --> 14:02.367
You look like
a slutty carrot"?

14:04.900 --> 14:06.367
So, what do you think?
Is that, uh --

14:06.367 --> 14:07.967
What's the point
of that message?

14:07.967 --> 14:09.767
Stop the spray tans!

14:09.767 --> 14:12.200
What if you
started with, "Dar--"

14:12.200 --> 14:15.133
Wait, why can't you
just tell her in person?

14:16.767 --> 14:18.333
Because then we
wouldn't have a game.

14:18.333 --> 14:21.133
You know, something like this
is better just electronically.

14:21.133 --> 14:21.900
I don't have to deal
with --

14:21.900 --> 14:22.567
To your wife?

14:22.567 --> 14:24.400
Yeah!

14:24.400 --> 14:25.800
This guy's awesome!

14:25.800 --> 14:27.333
Can I help you reword it
a little bit?

14:27.333 --> 14:29.067
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

14:29.067 --> 14:30.567
-Unprompted!
-I love --

14:30.567 --> 14:31.667
-This is the greatest...
-I love him.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.500
...human on the planet.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.633
He's typing.
He's straight-up typing.

14:35.633 --> 14:38.067
Which line are you working
the slutty carrot into?

14:38.067 --> 14:39.067
Um...

14:40.767 --> 14:42.467
Does it have to be
specifically slutty carrot?

14:42.467 --> 14:43.600
Is that what you're
really going for?

14:45.867 --> 14:47.500
-Okay. Here we go. Here we go.
-Here we go, here we go.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.600
-Here it is.
-"Darlene, you know I love you

14:49.600 --> 14:51.300
more than anyone else."
Good beginning.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.600
"I wanted the real you.
Keep the carrots for dinner.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.767
You look like a deluxe
Oompa Loompa.

14:56.767 --> 14:58.067
XOXO, James."

14:58.067 --> 14:58.833
Very good.

14:58.833 --> 15:00.433
-Wow!
-Wow!

15:00.433 --> 15:01.767
He changed it.
That's a loss.

15:01.767 --> 15:02.567
Thank you, man.
I appreciate it.

15:02.567 --> 15:03.567
Hey, good luck.

15:03.567 --> 15:04.600
Have you seen "Aladdin?"
On Broadway?

15:04.600 --> 15:05.467
No.

15:07.233 --> 15:09.167
Do you want to go?
I mean, if you want to
go, just let me know.

15:09.167 --> 15:10.833
Oh, my God. He has to come to
"Aladdin" tonight. For real.

15:10.833 --> 15:12.133
He's gotta go, dude.
We'll send a camera.

15:12.133 --> 15:14.167
Murr, if this guy goes
to "Aladdin" with you,

15:14.167 --> 15:15.300
you can have the win.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.533
Do y--
would you seriously go?

15:16.533 --> 15:17.700
7:00?

15:17.700 --> 15:18.733
All right.

15:18.733 --> 15:21.067
-Oh, I love him!
-This is unbelievable!

15:21.067 --> 15:23.100
He found someone
to go to "Aladdin"!

15:23.100 --> 15:24.200
You're going to "Aladdin"?

15:24.200 --> 15:25.733
I'm free --
I had a haircut,

15:25.733 --> 15:27.567
but I'll reschedule for
a free "Aladdin" show.

15:27.567 --> 15:29.200
Sal: Free "Aladdin"?
"I had a haircut,
but I'd cancel it"!

15:29.200 --> 15:31.567
"I had a haircut,
but I can cancel it."

15:31.567 --> 15:33.967
Yeah. I'll -- I'll
comb it for tonight.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.867
**

15:35.867 --> 15:37.933
If he doesn't show...

15:37.933 --> 15:39.800
Oh, hey!
You weren't kidding
about the haircut, man.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.333
Dude, the guy just
took it all off.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.867
So, let's go inside.
This is gonna be awesome.

15:43.867 --> 15:46.333
One thing
I wanted to mention...

15:46.333 --> 15:48.200
You guys should also
check out the TV show

15:48.200 --> 15:49.533
"Impractical Jokers."

15:49.533 --> 15:52.067
"Impra--"
What's it about?

15:52.067 --> 15:53.867
You never heard
of "Impractical Jokers"?

15:53.867 --> 15:56.200
No! Why?
Is that a popular show?

15:56.200 --> 15:58.267
**

15:59.833 --> 16:02.667
Narrator: Q and Sal's e-mails
got stuck in the outbox,

16:02.667 --> 16:05.633
which makes Sal
tonight's big loser.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.733
All right!
Sal is our big loser!

16:07.733 --> 16:09.867
We've brought him to
the Willowbrook Mall
for his punishment.

16:09.867 --> 16:11.533
Buddy, we want you to
go down to the food court

16:11.533 --> 16:13.800
and then await
further instructions.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.200
That's how it's gonna be?
We're not gonna reveal any info?

16:16.200 --> 16:17.900
Await further instructions.
Always with the...

16:17.900 --> 16:19.800
You're not gonna tell me
what I got to do right now?

16:19.800 --> 16:21.067
-No!
-No.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.267
Just, shh.
There's gonna be
a big twist

16:22.267 --> 16:24.767
No, watch this.
Ready? Swipe.

16:24.767 --> 16:26.900
**

16:26.900 --> 16:29.300
There he is.
King of the food court.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.667
Q: No, he hates food courts.
Sal is not a food-court fan.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.167
You ready for what
you have to do?

16:33.167 --> 16:35.367
-Sure. Take a guess.

16:35.367 --> 16:39.067
There is a person here,
I have to find out who they are,

16:39.067 --> 16:41.067
and I have to go
through everybody.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.433
What is this, season 2?

16:43.600 --> 16:46.233
I'm gonna put you on
with the wig master general.

16:46.233 --> 16:47.533
Murr: Sal, you see how
there's all these people

16:47.533 --> 16:50.100
talking in the food court?

16:50.100 --> 16:51.100
Yeah...

16:51.100 --> 16:52.667
So, we want you
to shush people.

16:53.933 --> 16:56.100
Q: One on one, go up to people
and ask them to --

16:56.100 --> 16:58.100
Individual shushing is
what we're looking for.

16:58.100 --> 16:58.933
Let's just bring it down.

16:58.933 --> 17:00.933
Oh, boy. All right.

17:00.933 --> 17:01.900
Ohh.

17:03.733 --> 17:06.167
Oh, they're talkin'.

17:06.167 --> 17:07.867
You son of a bitch.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.867
Ready? In 3, 2, 1...

17:14.867 --> 17:16.600
shush!

17:16.600 --> 17:17.633
Ohh...

17:18.633 --> 17:20.333
You just shoot a blank?
Come on.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.433
Shhhh!

17:24.167 --> 17:26.667
They're doing their best
to ignore him!

17:26.667 --> 17:28.100
I say you hit 'er again.

17:28.100 --> 17:29.767
Please, guys, guys, guys...

17:29.767 --> 17:32.367
Okay.
Ready, Sal?

17:32.367 --> 17:33.967
you guys.

17:33.967 --> 17:37.067
3, 2, 1...

17:37.067 --> 17:38.067
Shhhh!

17:38.067 --> 17:40.267
Oh! Oh!

17:42.567 --> 17:44.733
-No!

17:44.733 --> 17:46.067
No!

17:46.067 --> 17:47.067
Q: There's about 100 more people
in this food court.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.700
No!

17:48.700 --> 17:51.067
In front of you are a bunch
of construction workers.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.067
Joe: Sending him in
for the shush.

17:54.067 --> 17:55.667
I'm not gonna lie, buddy,
I straight up

17:55.667 --> 17:58.233
want to see you get killed.

17:58.233 --> 18:03.067
All: 4, 3, 2, 1...

18:03.067 --> 18:04.900
Shh!

18:05.900 --> 18:09.867
-Ohh-ho-ho!
-One more -- shush!

18:09.867 --> 18:13.200
Shh.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.967
I'm out of here.
I'm leaving real fast.

18:18.067 --> 18:21.367
And he's gonna -- the slight jog
down the steps, and he's out!

18:21.367 --> 18:23.233
This is harder than
anything I've done.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.233
Sal's not being rude.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.667
They're being rude
being so loud!

18:25.667 --> 18:27.733
Yes. So Sal is doing
a service.

18:27.733 --> 18:30.067
**

18:30.067 --> 18:33.433
She's talkin'!
She's talkin'!

18:33.433 --> 18:35.667
Here we go.

18:35.667 --> 18:38.600
I would love it
if you shushed.

18:38.600 --> 18:39.733
Ohh-ho!

18:39.733 --> 18:43.533
I would love it
if you shhh -- shushed.

18:43.533 --> 18:45.767
Her husband, too.

18:45.767 --> 18:48.100
Well, both of you.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.833
If you sh-- if you shhh.

18:50.833 --> 18:53.233
-Uh...
-'Cause I said so.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.433
'Cause I said.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.500
Here we go! There it is!
There's the table!

19:03.500 --> 19:06.367
Q: Sal, you remember in, um,
"Pee-wee's Big Adventure"

19:06.367 --> 19:09.967
where he's like, "I'm trying
to use the phoooone!"

19:09.967 --> 19:10.933
Gimme that.

19:15.067 --> 19:18.167
I'm trying to use the phone!

19:19.700 --> 19:21.333
Shh.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.167
Ohh.

19:23.167 --> 19:25.600
Ohh.
-Ahh!

19:25.600 --> 19:26.833
Can I please leave?

19:26.833 --> 19:29.867
One more. One more.
Shush!

19:29.867 --> 19:31.600
Phone! Shush!

19:34.800 --> 19:36.767
You can get up.
Walk away.

19:36.767 --> 19:39.067
Sal, I'm gonna want you
to do a drive-by --

19:39.067 --> 19:42.333
"Phone, phone, shush, shush,"
and just keep going.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.467
Shh. Shh.
Phone. Phone.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.900
Sal, you know, that's a pretty
good impersonation, buddy.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.567
Joe: It's not bad.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.133
Sal, what about this
girl right in front of
you on the cell phone?

19:54.133 --> 19:57.100
-Yeah. Good luck.
-Be aggressive.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.600
Get her! Get her!

19:58.600 --> 20:01.200
He's comin' in hot
for the shush.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.700
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

20:07.633 --> 20:09.967
He's hiding.

20:09.967 --> 20:11.867
Murr: "Mind your
own business"! Ahh!

20:13.767 --> 20:14.467
Oh, look! Look!

20:14.467 --> 20:17.600
Uh-oh!

20:17.600 --> 20:19.867
-Wow!
-Ohh!

20:19.867 --> 20:22.033
-Good luck with that.
-Oh, wow!

20:22.033 --> 20:24.667
I gotta -- I gotta --
I gotta -- Ow!

20:24.667 --> 20:26.833
Sal, why you going
in there?!

20:26.833 --> 20:29.933
He ran into the door!

20:29.933 --> 20:32.067
He had to get out!

20:32.067 --> 20:33.400
I'm not doing any more.
I'm done now.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.733
That's it. I'm not gonna
do it anymore.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.433
Q: All right, you're done!
You're done!

20:36.433 --> 20:40.000
**

20:40.000 --> 20:41.333
Welcome to
"Impractical Insider."

20:41.333 --> 20:43.167
Sal just got served
in the food court,

20:43.167 --> 20:45.733
having to tell people shh
while they're eating.

20:45.733 --> 20:47.300
Sal...

20:47.300 --> 20:48.600
how do you feel?

20:48.600 --> 20:51.267
Shh! We're gonna show you
behind the scenes right now.

20:51.267 --> 20:53.767
Pete: Punishments
like today can be

20:53.767 --> 20:55.800
the most cringe-worthy
that we do.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.733
Yeah.
It's just -- you feel --

20:56.733 --> 20:58.333
It's painful watching.

20:58.333 --> 21:01.600
Or like, something as simple
as Q crossing out the kid's...

21:01.600 --> 21:03.500
-Yeah, yeah.
-...art project.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.900
-Oh, no!
-My life is horrible.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.700
-3, 2, 1...
-All right!

21:10.700 --> 21:12.300
Sal is our big loser!

21:12.300 --> 21:13.367
There's gonna be a big
twist

21:13.367 --> 21:15.100
Watch this.
Ready? Swipe.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.333
Good. All right, cut.
Good work, guys.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.833
-Cut.
-So, it's very hot

21:18.833 --> 21:19.933
out right now.

21:19.933 --> 21:21.300
That was probably
the quickest intro

21:21.300 --> 21:23.133
in "Impractical Jokers"
history.

21:23.133 --> 21:25.167
They did not want to stand
out here, and I don't either.

21:25.167 --> 21:26.833
Why am I wearing
this sweatshirt?

21:26.833 --> 21:28.933
Joe: Individual shushing
is what we're looking for.

21:28.933 --> 21:30.300
'Cause it's way too loud
down there, buddy.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.733
Let's just bring it down.

21:31.733 --> 21:32.900
Ohh, boy. All right.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.533
There he is! Sending him
in for the shush.

21:35.533 --> 21:36.933
I was just --
I was just passing by.

21:36.933 --> 21:38.467
I wanted to say, shhh.

21:38.467 --> 21:40.067
-Oh.
-Shh.

21:41.667 --> 21:44.400
Sal, kinda whisper under
your breath, "Still talkin'."

21:44.400 --> 21:46.767
Still talkin'.
Still talkin'.

21:49.067 --> 21:51.600
They took it great.
They also have life experience.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.100
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-They're good sports.

21:53.100 --> 21:54.500
What do you think, guys?
I almost done?

21:54.500 --> 21:55.833
-No!
-No!

21:55.833 --> 21:57.567
I have one thing
to say to that...

21:57.567 --> 21:58.633
Shhh!

22:00.600 --> 22:02.067
Okay, and, we're gonna
shush in...

22:02.067 --> 22:05.767
All: 3, 2, 1...

22:05.767 --> 22:07.167
Shh!

22:07.167 --> 22:07.900
Q: Oh!

22:11.733 --> 22:13.133
I can't stay here.

22:13.133 --> 22:14.533
I'll let you escape
from this moment

22:14.533 --> 22:15.633
if you turn to them
and go...

22:15.633 --> 22:17.067
* Da-da-da-da-da da,
shh! *

22:17.067 --> 22:18.067
...and run away.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.733
It's so stupid.

22:23.733 --> 22:26.867
3, 2, 1...

22:26.867 --> 22:29.167
* Bee-dah-bop buh-do bop,
shush! *

22:32.833 --> 22:35.700
The slight jog down
the steps, and he's out!

22:35.700 --> 22:38.767
-He's movin'!
-Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

22:43.067 --> 22:44.933
-Oh, my God!
-Uh-oh!

22:44.933 --> 22:46.567
"Mind you own business"!
Ohhh!

22:46.567 --> 22:49.567
Q: Wow!

22:49.567 --> 22:51.333
That's why this
is a punishment.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.733
Wow.

22:52.733 --> 22:54.533
The toughest things to do
are the most simple.

22:54.533 --> 22:56.367
Like give an old woman
the middle finger?

22:56.367 --> 23:00.500
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

23:00.500 --> 23:02.633
This is breaking
social convention...

23:02.633 --> 23:03.333
Mm-hmm.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.467
Ohh.

23:04.467 --> 23:05.867
Joe:
You just shoot a blank?

23:05.867 --> 23:07.133
Come on.
I think people are

23:07.133 --> 23:09.100
calling you
the cringe king.

23:09.100 --> 23:11.733
Don't get that started.
No one's calling me that.

23:11.733 --> 23:13.333
Everyone's calling --
#CringeKing.

23:13.333 --> 23:15.600
What are you doing?
What are you, looking to...

23:15.600 --> 23:19.067
Why are you branding me
the cringe king?

23:19.067 --> 23:21.967
Growing up, I hated cantaloupe
and honeydew melon.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.767
Now I think it's
like God's gift to us.

23:24.767 --> 23:26.467
You're an -- You sound
like an ass

23:26.467 --> 23:28.067
-No one likes cantaloupe.

23:28.067 --> 23:29.267
That's the cheap
they throw on...

23:29.267 --> 23:31.133
Cantaloupe's the filler...
to get around the pineapple

23:31.133 --> 23:32.433
and the grapes
and the strawberries.

23:32.433 --> 23:34.433
If you never knew what the price
point was of any fruit

23:34.433 --> 23:35.867
and you just blind
taste-tested them,

23:35.867 --> 23:37.133
this would still
come out on top.

23:37.133 --> 23:38.933
When 50% of it's that
and nobody eats it.

23:40.500 --> 23:41.700
The cherry's
an underused fruit.

23:41.700 --> 23:44.700
Cherries are the best.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.400
I'll go on record
saying it --

23:46.400 --> 23:48.833
I don't give a
what you think, Cole.

23:48.833 --> 23:50.467
-They're bad.

23:50.467 --> 23:53.067
I wonder if bananas had a pit,
would people eat them as much.

23:53.067 --> 23:57.933
**

23:57.933 --> 24:02.900
**

24:02.900 --> 24:04.800
Go  yourself, Al.
I'm hungry.
