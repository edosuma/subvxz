WEBVTT

00:03.320 --> 00:05.733
We was camping,
and we was eating,

00:06.111 --> 00:09.185
and it was a mountain lion jump
all the way down and eat my leg.

00:10.325 --> 00:13.685
I think a mountain lion jump
down and eat someone's grammar.

00:13.686 --> 00:15.152
The auto-tune
remix is way better.

00:15.153 --> 00:16.956
Go to related videos. - Uh-huh.

00:16.957 --> 00:21.849
We was... we was camping, camping,
we was eeeeeeating, eating...

00:21.850 --> 00:24.345
- Professor?
- Oh, Annie, please don't start.

00:24.346 --> 00:25.394
We've been through this.

00:25.395 --> 00:27.780
Anthropology is the
study of humanity.

00:27.781 --> 00:29.107
Nothing is off topic.

00:29.282 --> 00:31.215
No, it's just,
I've seen this one.

00:31.270 --> 00:33.879
Put in "car crash camel toe."

00:33.884 --> 00:38.839
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
"Ski lift ninja crotch rip."

00:38.942 --> 00:41.323
Whoo! I'm a ski lift ninja!

00:41.324 --> 00:42.535
Oh!

00:46.553 --> 00:48.568
Look, Dolly Parton
eating a hot dog.

00:48.668 --> 00:50.153
- Stop that!
- Yeah.

00:50.514 --> 00:51.829
I can do what I want.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.340
Uh, what happens
if you type in "God"?

00:54.341 --> 00:55.634
Boo!

00:56.961 --> 00:58.546
No, no, no, no, no.
Do not boo her.

00:58.547 --> 01:01.692
This subject's lack of
definition cuts both ways.

01:01.719 --> 01:04.294
If farts are fair game, so is God.

01:04.918 --> 01:06.699
Top hit, "God of farts."

01:08.064 --> 01:10.082
- You ask for it...
- It balances out.

01:12.046 --> 01:13.909
That's blasphemous.
Who wants to see that?

01:13.910 --> 01:17.087
- 17 million people.
- Oh.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.919
There were nine people
at my church last night.

01:24.875 --> 01:26.361
Auto-tune God of farts. - Yeah!

01:26.362 --> 01:28.418
Yeah!...
way ahead of you.

02:06.907 --> 02:08.967
Abed, guess who's got two thumbs

02:08.967 --> 02:11.033
and has an exciting career
opportunity for you?

02:11.754 --> 02:12.768
This guy.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.383
I'm pointing my thumbs at God.

02:15.513 --> 02:17.193
I'm using one thumb
to say that's great.

02:17.194 --> 02:19.014
Um, I told my
pastor about YouTube

02:19.015 --> 02:20.456
and how there's no light
there for the kids,

02:20.457 --> 02:21.809
and our church wants to sponsor

02:21.810 --> 02:23.916
the making of a viral video
with a Christian message.

02:23.917 --> 02:26.010
Ha! What are you gonna do,
"rapping Jesus"?

02:26.011 --> 02:27.119
Pierce, please just step aside

02:27.120 --> 02:28.529
and make room for
a new generation.

02:28.921 --> 02:31.789
Um, Abed, would you like to
make a Christian YouTube?

02:31.790 --> 02:32.782
I know you're Muslim.

02:32.783 --> 02:33.935
As a Muslim,
I'd be happy to do it.

02:33.936 --> 02:35.254
As a filmmaker, no way.

02:35.255 --> 02:36.630
I'm a storyteller, not a preacher.

02:36.631 --> 02:39.710
Well, the Bible has been called
the greatest story ever told.

02:39.940 --> 02:41.918
Ben Lyons said the same
thing about I am legend.

02:42.213 --> 02:45.008
Oh, well, I'll have
to rent that, then.

02:45.946 --> 02:47.872
- Whoa.
- What?

02:48.341 --> 02:49.849
That's a lot of
pasta for no veggies.

02:49.850 --> 02:51.428
You're not in
charge of what I eat.

02:51.429 --> 02:53.139
That's true. Britta!

02:57.426 --> 02:59.643
And some damn broccoli, please.

02:59.911 --> 03:01.837
Pierce has been
acting out a lot lately.

03:01.838 --> 03:03.159
Maybe you should talk to him.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.582
How is that my job?

03:06.016 --> 03:07.670
Aren't you, like, the dad?

03:07.671 --> 03:09.934
Would the dad walk away
from this conversation?

03:10.355 --> 03:11.267
No?

03:11.710 --> 03:12.574
Ah!

03:16.730 --> 03:18.080
You're having cookies for lunch?

03:18.081 --> 03:20.320
- Yeah.
- Hey, you didn't pay for those.

03:20.363 --> 03:21.632
Call a cop.

03:24.457 --> 03:25.858
Heads up, gay wads.

03:25.859 --> 03:27.963
- Hey!
- Cookies!

03:28.213 --> 03:30.124
***

03:31.937 --> 03:33.498
What are you looking at?

03:33.942 --> 03:34.987
Your face.

03:34.988 --> 03:37.157
That's what you're
supposed to look at.

03:37.709 --> 03:38.392
So?

03:38.393 --> 03:40.050
So? You gonna sit down or what?

03:40.051 --> 03:43.527
Oh, no, I usually sit
with the younger people.

03:43.528 --> 03:46.020
Well, la de da de da.

03:46.021 --> 03:47.974
No, no, we watch
videos on "youtune,"

03:47.975 --> 03:50.446
and you guys probably don't
even know what that is.

03:50.447 --> 03:51.491
We don't care.

03:51.492 --> 03:52.613
Pierce, are you looking for us?

03:52.614 --> 03:54.416
We're sitting over there.
I can see!

03:54.417 --> 03:56.929
Sheesh! Did you take your pills?

03:56.930 --> 03:59.227
- Ooh!
- Mama's boy.

03:59.228 --> 04:01.718
We're having a private
conversation here.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.606
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, hi.

04:03.607 --> 04:06.244
I'm... I'm Britta, Pierce's...
Pbbt!

04:07.495 --> 04:09.638
Very nice meeting you guys.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.377
"Very nice meeting you guys."

04:16.913 --> 04:18.041
She's a lesbian.

04:26.189 --> 04:27.300
- Shirley.
- Hmm?

04:27.301 --> 04:29.789
- I read the new testament.
- The whole thing?

04:29.853 --> 04:31.159
You know, being
raised by TV and movies,

04:31.160 --> 04:32.872
I always thought that
Jesus just walked on water

04:32.873 --> 04:34.299
and told people not
to have abortions,

04:34.300 --> 04:35.804
but it's so much cooler than that.

04:35.827 --> 04:38.800
He was like E.T., Edward Scissorhands,
and Marty McFly combined.

04:39.652 --> 04:41.132
I would love to
make a Jesus movie.

04:41.133 --> 04:43.165
Oh, Abed, that's wonderful!

04:43.171 --> 04:44.409
What do you think we should do?

04:44.410 --> 04:46.094
It needs to be cool and addictive,

04:46.095 --> 04:48.385
like that video of the
kitten falling asleep.

04:48.386 --> 04:49.301
Absolutely.

04:49.302 --> 04:50.347
But the story's
been told to death,

04:50.348 --> 04:51.790
so I want to approach
it in a new way.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.465
We need a Jesus movie for
the post post-modern world.

04:54.776 --> 04:57.830
Like Jesus as a rapper?

04:57.831 --> 04:58.707
No.

04:59.564 --> 05:00.778
I want to tell the story of Jesus

05:00.779 --> 05:03.381
from the perspective of a filmmaker
exploring the life of Jesus.

05:03.382 --> 05:06.332
That sounds very
appealing to filmmakers.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.491
See, in the filmmaker's film,
Jesus is a filmmaker

05:08.492 --> 05:09.973
trying to find God
with his camera.

05:09.974 --> 05:12.075
But then the filmmaker realizes
that he's actually Jesus

05:12.076 --> 05:13.646
and he's being filmed
by God's camera.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.127
And it goes like that
forever in both directions,

05:15.128 --> 05:15.987
like a mirror in a mirror,

05:15.988 --> 05:17.343
because all of the
filmmakers are Jesus,

05:17.344 --> 05:20.698
and all their cameras are God,
and the movie is called Abed.

05:21.970 --> 05:23.194
All caps.

05:23.195 --> 05:26.224
Filmmaking beyond film.
A metafilm.

05:26.337 --> 05:27.666
My masterpiece.

05:27.667 --> 05:32.035
- But I don't like it.
- Well, that's okay.

05:32.036 --> 05:34.022
You know, you're reacting the
way the world did to Jesus.

05:34.958 --> 05:36.403
I'm reacting the
way the world does

05:36.404 --> 05:38.922
to movies about making
movies about making movies.

05:38.923 --> 05:40.140
I mean, come on, Charlie Kaufman,

05:40.141 --> 05:42.013
some of us have work
in the morning, damn.

05:42.022 --> 05:43.642
Does this mean you don't
want to work on the movie?

05:44.217 --> 05:45.823
This means there is no movie.

05:52.263 --> 05:53.836
This is the movie.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.616
The game is Jacks
and deuces wild.

05:57.617 --> 06:00.712
Except if the dean comes in,
and then it's bingo.

06:03.678 --> 06:05.421
Keep it. I've got another one.

06:06.316 --> 06:10.327
If you get caught with that, just
say it's your 90th birthday.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.095
Suddenly, it's adorable.

06:13.251 --> 06:14.221
That's right.

06:14.225 --> 06:17.066
All right, now.
What is this again?

06:17.783 --> 06:19.390
B-19.

06:19.391 --> 06:21.305
No. B-19, my butt.

06:21.306 --> 06:23.710
I told you guys no poker,
all right?

06:23.711 --> 06:25.630
Shut this down!

06:25.631 --> 06:28.192
Shut your mouth down, fruit.

06:28.193 --> 06:31.228
Oh, hey, unacceptable,
and none of your business,

06:31.229 --> 06:32.501
and barely the whole truth.

06:32.502 --> 06:34.929
All right, everyone go home.

06:34.930 --> 06:37.461
- Excuse me, mister?
- What, Pierce?

06:38.130 --> 06:39.118
What year is it?

06:39.119 --> 06:40.016
What?

06:40.684 --> 06:42.656
Poker helps him remember.

06:43.714 --> 06:44.710
Veronica.

06:55.119 --> 06:56.970
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

06:56.980 --> 06:58.052
You are okay, kid.

06:58.053 --> 06:59.525
Go ahead and deal. Let's go.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.932
Jesus, did you really die
for our sins? That's dopey.

07:02.933 --> 07:04.539
Oh, uh, dope.

07:04.540 --> 07:08.338
Ooh, freudian slip, perhaps due
to my feeling kind of dopey.

07:08.339 --> 07:09.749
Do the line, atheist.

07:09.750 --> 07:12.077
Jesus, did you really
die for our sins?

07:12.078 --> 07:13.511
That's dope.

07:14.188 --> 07:15.559
You think that's dope?

07:15.560 --> 07:19.051
Check out these... beatitudes.

07:25.965 --> 07:28.092
Blessed be the peacemakers,
word to the meek,

07:28.093 --> 07:32.546
the kingdom of heaven is open all
week, Jesus and me were... oh!

07:32.859 --> 07:34.425
I have arrived!

07:34.426 --> 07:37.224
I am watched, as I am watching.

07:37.685 --> 07:41.188
I am audience and creation.

07:43.150 --> 07:45.303
The earth shall know my power!

07:45.454 --> 07:47.193
Abed, what are you doing?

07:47.194 --> 07:49.615
Oh, great! You blew the take!

07:49.616 --> 07:51.890
No, no, keep rolling.

07:53.237 --> 07:54.763
This can all be part of it.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.562
There are no takes.

07:57.759 --> 07:59.098
There is no viewer.

07:59.851 --> 08:01.294
The film is the story.

08:01.295 --> 08:02.795
The story is us.

08:03.318 --> 08:05.435
We are the film.

08:05.436 --> 08:06.666
It's totally meta.

08:06.667 --> 08:09.495
Well, let's get back to our
non-meta production, shall we?

08:09.496 --> 08:11.624
Come on. - No,
I want to watch this.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.960
Troy, there's no time.

08:13.513 --> 08:15.855
Then, we quit. Right, Britta?

08:15.856 --> 08:18.987
I don't even believe in God,
but I love me some Abed.

08:18.988 --> 08:20.003
Yeah.

08:21.121 --> 08:22.223
Wait, wait.

08:36.278 --> 08:39.091
"The story of the
story is the story."

08:39.251 --> 08:41.342
Sure, that'll play
in poughkeepsie.

08:41.482 --> 08:44.275
I heard some theaters are
gonna show it in reverse.

08:44.275 --> 08:46.910
I heard it's the same
movie backward and forward.

08:46.911 --> 08:49.195
I heard the deleted
scenes are the scenes

08:49.196 --> 08:51.409
and the scenes are
the deleted scenes.

08:51.410 --> 08:53.462
I heard Jesus died for our sins.

08:54.151 --> 08:55.198
Oh, hey, guys,

08:55.624 --> 08:58.175
the director's answering
questions in the cafeteria,

08:58.176 --> 09:00.829
and it both is and isn't
part of the movie!

09:00.830 --> 09:02.148
- Ah!
- Get a table!

09:05.027 --> 09:08.267
Abed, are we all in
the movie right now?

09:09.705 --> 09:12.905
We are all in a movie,
even when there are no cameras.

09:13.876 --> 09:15.693
When will the movie be released?

09:16.256 --> 09:17.751
When is life released?

09:18.807 --> 09:20.739
Every minute of our lives
is a world premiere,

09:20.740 --> 09:22.603
and my father has already
bought the popcorn.

09:22.608 --> 09:23.806
Whoa!

09:24.401 --> 09:27.898
Excuse me, Abed, but you
aren't actually trying to say

09:27.899 --> 09:30.466
that you're Jesus, are you?

09:30.727 --> 09:32.761
I am who you say I am.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.084
Oh, man.

09:35.573 --> 09:39.056
Okay, yeah, ooh, it's meta now.

09:39.057 --> 09:40.460
Except here's the thing.

09:40.461 --> 09:42.708
I'm a devout Christian,
and you guys

09:42.709 --> 09:45.651
are feeding into this
poor boy's delusions.

09:45.652 --> 09:49.245
So cool! She's an actual
real life pharisee!

09:49.308 --> 09:51.828
Hey, bitch, why don't you
go back to your temple?

09:51.829 --> 09:52.748
Yeah!

09:53.519 --> 09:56.088
Why don't you all
stop confusing Jesus

09:56.089 --> 09:59.228
with an egotistical
filmmaking lunatic?

10:02.124 --> 10:03.353
I forgive her.

10:20.144 --> 10:22.730
So, how's your film going, Abed?

10:22.731 --> 10:23.959
Blasphemously.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.330
It's not blasphemy to say
that we are God, Shirley.

10:27.149 --> 10:28.502
First Corinthians:

10:28.769 --> 10:32.991
"He who unites himself with the
lord is one with him in spirit."

10:32.992 --> 10:34.839
Did you just
scripture me, Muslim?

10:35.118 --> 10:36.307
Jesus was Jewish.

10:36.308 --> 10:38.003
Are you ever gonna let that go?

10:38.061 --> 10:40.302
Hey. No religious talk.

10:42.582 --> 10:43.808
Somebody's late.

10:44.350 --> 10:45.862
What is that in your pocket?

10:46.522 --> 10:48.716
Jeff, Britta,
Pierce is smoking cigars.

10:50.580 --> 10:52.145
What's it to you, butt-breath?

10:52.669 --> 10:53.791
Look at your eyes.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.212
Have you been out all
night with those hipsters?

10:55.213 --> 10:56.270
Hipsters?

10:56.271 --> 10:58.345
That pack of old people that
hang out in the cafeteria.

10:58.346 --> 11:00.423
People call them hipsters 'cause
they all have hip replacements.

11:00.424 --> 11:01.806
They do not.

11:02.167 --> 11:04.047
Leonard could probably
kick your ass.

11:05.049 --> 11:06.004
Leonard?

11:06.629 --> 11:08.192
You're hanging out with Leonard?

11:08.574 --> 11:09.626
You know I hate him.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.873
So? Everybody hates him.

11:11.874 --> 11:13.219
That's why he's cool.

11:14.188 --> 11:15.416
You people don't get it.

11:15.417 --> 11:17.670
Well, Pierce, I'm not
sure that I want to get it,

11:17.671 --> 11:19.085
and I think you ought
to take a break

11:19.086 --> 11:20.167
from these new friends of yours.

11:20.168 --> 11:21.719
They've got you all riled up.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.174
That's what Leonard
said you'd say.

11:23.175 --> 11:25.894
Well, Leonard is not a
part of this study group,

11:25.895 --> 11:27.882
so you apologize right now to...

11:28.204 --> 11:29.410
what? Ah!

11:29.568 --> 11:30.758
I'm not your father!

11:30.759 --> 11:32.033
I never said you were!

11:32.336 --> 11:34.127
- Where are you going?
- Out!

11:35.627 --> 11:37.772
When did Pierce become awesome?

11:37.773 --> 11:39.799
I am gonna shut you down,
you know that?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.529
- I do.
- Oh! Oh, I get it!

11:41.530 --> 11:42.659
I'm supposed to shut you down.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.990
Well, I'm not gonna do it.
Don't.

11:43.991 --> 11:45.324
- I won't.
- Good.

11:45.325 --> 11:46.387
I am gonna shut you down.

11:46.388 --> 11:47.287
Good.

11:52.981 --> 11:54.363
You should have seen his face.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.309
He was terrified.

11:56.745 --> 11:59.106
You're his worst nightmare now.

11:59.107 --> 12:00.899
You're old and you
don't give a damn.

12:00.900 --> 12:01.906
Booyah!

12:09.893 --> 12:11.937
Don't make eye contact,
and we'll be fine.

12:14.188 --> 12:15.632
Mmm, here comes the boss!

12:16.278 --> 12:19.272
- The dean has got a date.
- What a lovely couple.

12:19.273 --> 12:21.022
Please, give us a break,
will you?

12:21.023 --> 12:23.579
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh!

12:24.463 --> 12:26.599
I don't want to see you hipsters
when I come back out here!

12:26.600 --> 12:28.406
Go! Run, run. We made them angry.

12:28.407 --> 12:30.973
We've made them angry.
Hey, he left his keys.

12:30.974 --> 12:33.137
Ooh, who's up for a joyride?

12:33.138 --> 12:35.410
- Hell yeah.
- Oh, I don't know.

12:35.411 --> 12:37.353
We could get into some
serious trouble here.

12:37.354 --> 12:38.303
Oh, come on.

12:38.304 --> 12:41.726
We get caught, we can just
pretend we're disoriented,

12:41.727 --> 12:43.374
and he can give us a ride home.

12:43.375 --> 12:46.957
Where am I? What year is it?

12:48.956 --> 12:50.257
But we've all been drinking.

12:50.258 --> 12:52.463
Oh, grow a schmekel.

12:55.266 --> 12:56.797
Okay, everyone,
this is the last scene.

12:56.893 --> 12:59.193
I want to thank you all for
contributing in your small way

12:59.194 --> 13:01.588
to the greatest film ever made.

13:01.589 --> 13:04.996
And on the seventh day,
Shirley shut down production.

13:04.997 --> 13:06.510
Abed, Shirley has informed me

13:06.511 --> 13:07.862
that you are using
school equipment

13:07.863 --> 13:10.530
on school property to
make a religious film.

13:10.531 --> 13:12.550
She has filed an
official complaint,

13:12.551 --> 13:14.996
invoking the separation
of church and state.

13:14.997 --> 13:16.963
I pointed out the
irony to her already.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.646
Don't give a crap.
Let's be ironic.

13:18.647 --> 13:19.538
Shut it down. - Okay.

13:19.539 --> 13:22.485
Abed, are you making
a religious film?

13:22.865 --> 13:24.662
All movies are religious to me.

13:24.902 --> 13:28.252
Nice. But is it a
movie about Jesus?

13:28.253 --> 13:30.623
Is the matrix? Is Robocop?

13:30.791 --> 13:32.428
Is superman returns?

13:32.618 --> 13:35.258
All stories are about
death and resurrection.

13:35.259 --> 13:37.332
I've got one.
Wrath of Khan, hmm?

13:37.333 --> 13:38.124
That's a good one.

13:38.125 --> 13:40.756
Spock sacrifices himself
for the crew and gets reborn.

13:40.757 --> 13:43.504
How captivating was
Ricardo Montalban in that?

13:43.505 --> 13:46.929
Except in Abed's film,
the character's name isn't Spock!

13:47.239 --> 13:50.035
That's true. It's Abed.

13:50.036 --> 13:53.374
Oh. I'm getting
creative goose bumps here.

13:53.386 --> 13:55.174
I love Charlie Kaufman.

13:55.175 --> 13:56.731
I need to run into
editing for one second,

13:56.732 --> 13:58.046
but if you want,
we can grab you a chair

13:58.047 --> 13:59.326
and you can watch a take.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.130
I would love that.

14:02.416 --> 14:03.953
I've never watched a take before.

14:03.954 --> 14:06.210
This is exciting. - Uh, you...

14:07.848 --> 14:11.498
say what you will about Abed,
but the man cannot be killed.

14:13.451 --> 14:15.199
I mean, it's almost
like he's Jesus.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.572
I got it.

14:17.156 --> 14:18.657
I don't think we
should be driving.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.877
I mean, we're all,
you know, old and groggy.

14:21.878 --> 14:23.908
God, stop worrying.

14:24.021 --> 14:26.253
Richard flew zeroes
during the big one.

14:27.101 --> 14:28.194
What do you mean, "flew zeroes"?

14:28.195 --> 14:29.238
He's not Japanese.

14:29.239 --> 14:31.722
Well, what did you fly
during the big one, rich?

14:32.141 --> 14:33.387
Where am I?

14:33.388 --> 14:34.942
Oh, come on.
Stop farting around.

14:34.943 --> 14:37.254
Seriously,
I don't know where I am.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.228
What year is it?

14:41.016 --> 14:42.200
How do I drive?

14:59.362 --> 15:00.375
Let's bail.

15:00.793 --> 15:02.133
Wait a minute.
What about Richard?

15:02.134 --> 15:04.567
Screw Richard!
It's every man for himself!

15:13.169 --> 15:14.526
Richard, are you all right?

15:14.993 --> 15:18.009
Well, am I Richard?

15:18.432 --> 15:19.253
Yes.

15:19.254 --> 15:20.438
Then I'm fine.

15:20.513 --> 15:23.029
But who were those
people that ran away?

15:23.030 --> 15:24.282
Our friends?

15:25.227 --> 15:26.495
That's a good question.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.599
Oh.

15:29.399 --> 15:30.478
What is?

15:35.058 --> 15:37.826
There are no takes.
There is no viewer.

15:38.781 --> 15:41.552
The film is the story.
The story is us.

15:42.243 --> 15:44.295
We are the film.

15:46.093 --> 15:48.329
So, what do you think?

15:49.731 --> 15:50.890
I need to take a walk.

16:05.269 --> 16:08.362
Dear God, my movie is
the worst piece of crap

16:08.363 --> 16:10.061
I have ever seen
in my entire life.

16:11.465 --> 16:12.931
How could I have been so blind?

16:13.616 --> 16:15.296
It's a self-indulgent,
adolescent mess.

16:15.297 --> 16:16.682
I can barely sit through it.

16:18.466 --> 16:19.363
And now, with all this hype,

16:19.364 --> 16:21.035
I've got a real snakes
on a plane brewing.

16:22.506 --> 16:23.647
The critics are gonna crucify me.

16:23.648 --> 16:25.602
My career will be
over before it begins.

16:26.859 --> 16:29.815
God, if you're out there,
I know I don't deserve it,

16:29.816 --> 16:31.135
but I need your help.

16:31.197 --> 16:32.942
Please take this
project away from me.

16:33.585 --> 16:36.061
Make it rain, send a meteor,

16:36.713 --> 16:39.038
anything. Please?

16:40.053 --> 16:41.222
Now?

16:45.828 --> 16:48.514
Okay, I get it.
This is what I deserve.

16:50.581 --> 16:51.845
I'll finish it up.

17:50.279 --> 17:53.165
Hi, I'm Pierce Hawthorne's
emergency contact.

17:53.166 --> 17:54.539
- You're here to pick him up?
- No, no.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.956
I'm here to be removed
as his emergency contact.

17:57.171 --> 18:00.640
- One second.
- Hey, I got a class!

18:01.533 --> 18:02.630
Where is everybody?

18:02.882 --> 18:04.374
Is anyone coming to get Leonard?

18:05.027 --> 18:07.511
No. Nobody comes
for him anymore.

18:07.745 --> 18:09.886
His kids asked us to
stop calling them.

18:11.199 --> 18:12.787
Why do you think
he acts like that?

18:18.173 --> 18:19.621
So we're in prison, right?

18:21.932 --> 18:23.080
All right, bring him out.

18:24.599 --> 18:26.830
Over here, Pierce.
Come on. Book.

18:29.066 --> 18:29.737
Hey.

18:29.738 --> 18:30.949
Go wait in the car.

18:31.586 --> 18:32.395
It wasn't my fault.

18:32.396 --> 18:34.945
Go. Wait. In. The. Car.

18:37.609 --> 18:38.596
Ooh!...

18:41.055 --> 18:42.514
you want me to
change that or not?

18:42.515 --> 18:43.684
I guess not.

18:44.411 --> 18:45.935
Uh, but, um,
could you do me a favor?

18:45.936 --> 18:48.810
Could you add Britta
Perry as a contact?

18:48.822 --> 18:50.461
P-e-r-r-y.

18:50.683 --> 18:52.517
And would you give her a call
a couple of times a week?

18:52.518 --> 18:54.079
She gets pretty worried about him.

18:54.655 --> 18:57.371
And, uh, she works days,
so make sure you call at night.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.370
Everyone thinks what you
did was destined to happen,

19:18.122 --> 19:20.176
that it was proof that
God was making my movie,

19:20.269 --> 19:21.918
a movie so good,
it could never exist.

19:22.284 --> 19:24.301
They think I'm a genius,
and they think you're a villain.

19:27.987 --> 19:29.172
You heard me praying.

19:29.922 --> 19:31.388
I don't know what you mean.

19:32.618 --> 19:34.330
Oh, this is gonna be good!

19:34.331 --> 19:38.703
Abed sent me a new link, and that
man knows his video virality.

19:38.704 --> 19:42.438
So you're just gonna drop all
pretense of actually teaching us?

19:42.439 --> 19:44.091
Yeah. Here we go.

19:44.628 --> 19:47.352
Blessed be the peacemakers,
word to the meek,

19:47.353 --> 19:50.326
the kingdom of heaven
is open all week.

19:50.327 --> 19:51.813
You finished my movie.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.521
I don't know what you mean.

19:59.037 --> 20:00.059
You humble me.

20:01.168 --> 20:02.616
You humble me too.

20:10.834 --> 20:14.729
Okay, open your books, because
Abed has broken the Internet.

20:22.900 --> 20:23.930
 Great.

20:23.993 --> 20:28.294
So which one of us is gonna
head home and change?

20:31.614 --> 20:32.787
Hilarious.

20:32.788 --> 20:34.943
So you guys bought
one of my outfits

20:34.944 --> 20:38.929
and then staked out my apartment
every day until I wore it?

20:38.964 --> 20:40.457
That's not pathetic.

20:40.804 --> 20:41.702
Okay.

20:42.373 --> 20:43.257
Well.

20:43.774 --> 20:45.102
Good job.

20:45.425 --> 20:47.842
I guess I'm heading
home to change now.

20:49.322 --> 20:51.418
Oh, I hit traffic.
Did I miss it?
