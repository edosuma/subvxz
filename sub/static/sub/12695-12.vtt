00:07.667 --> 00:10.467
- *

00:13.000 --> 00:15.867
- Fry interception!

00:15.967 --> 00:20.300
- Jerk kick!
- Oww! Oh...

00:20.400 --> 00:22.500
Hey, Jay Jay, why isn't
the ketchup workin'?

00:22.600 --> 00:23.867
- Ketchup's offline.

00:23.967 --> 00:26.033
Table 8 had
a splat-tastrophe.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.533
You can't use your powers
to get that ketchup.

00:34.633 --> 00:35.867
People will see you.

00:35.967 --> 00:37.067
I'll get it.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.067
- You are such a scaredy cat.

00:39.167 --> 00:40.533
And a chicken.

00:40.633 --> 00:42.867
You're a chicken-cat.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.233
I eat food out of
mystery tubes.

00:47.333 --> 00:49.400
- Then use your powers,
chicken-cat.

00:55.533 --> 00:58.467
- Ha, who's
the chicken

00:58.567 --> 01:02.233
- Why don't you ask the guy who
just saw you use your powers?

01:05.133 --> 01:07.133
- Fix it.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.167
- I know--I'll just live
under this table forever.

01:10.267 --> 01:12.400
Send money and clothes.

01:12.500 --> 01:16.100
- No, go over there
and make him un-see it.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.833
- Okay, fine,
he saw my superpowers,

01:18.933 --> 01:20.967
now he's gonna see
my girly powers.

01:21.067 --> 01:22.867
- Hm...

01:26.667 --> 01:29.800
- Hi. So, did you, uh,
see my little magic trick there?

01:29.900 --> 01:32.433
I've got a million of 'em.

01:32.533 --> 01:34.433
Oh!

01:34.533 --> 01:37.500
- That's cool.
Hey, can you do this?

01:39.333 --> 01:42.067
- No, I cannot.

01:42.167 --> 01:46.867
- My name's Link and
I have superpowers like you.

01:53.167 --> 01:55.367
- Way to fix
things, Phoebe.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.100
- *

02:01.200 --> 02:02.333
* What you see

02:02.433 --> 02:03.967
* Is not what you get

02:04.067 --> 02:07.067
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:07.167 --> 02:08.867
* We fit right in

02:08.967 --> 02:10.300
* Bet you never guessed

02:10.400 --> 02:11.867
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:11.967 --> 02:13.467
* Just like all the rest

02:13.567 --> 02:15.233
* A picture
perfect family *

02:15.333 --> 02:17.300
* Is what we try to be

02:17.400 --> 02:18.500
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:18.600 --> 02:20.267
* The crazy things we do

02:20.367 --> 02:21.967
* This isn't
make believe *

02:22.067 --> 02:23.800
* It's our reality

02:23.900 --> 02:25.200
* Just your average family

02:25.300 --> 02:28.267
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:28.367 --> 02:31.933
* Livin' a double life

02:34.700 --> 02:37.333
- Okay, once I hack
into the Supe database

02:37.433 --> 02:40.067
we'll know exactly
who this Link guy is.

02:40.167 --> 02:41.833
- I can't believe there's
somebody else

02:41.933 --> 02:43.200
with powers in Hiddenville--

02:43.300 --> 02:47.267
and with such
a super cute smile.

02:47.367 --> 02:50.400
You're not gonna
believe who his father is.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.533
Dad's greatest enemy.

02:52.633 --> 02:54.433
- MAX: Evilman!

02:54.533 --> 02:58.533
- Ach, I thought his greatest
enemy was skinny jeans.

02:58.633 --> 03:00.800
- Evilman is Link's dad.
This is awful.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.267
Dad hates Evilman.

03:02.367 --> 03:04.300
- That's 'cause he's
the one supervillain

03:04.400 --> 03:06.300
your father could
never beat.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.733
Every fight ended in tie
and a city being destroyed.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.567
Those were the days.

03:11.667 --> 03:15.667
- Dad's just jealous of
Evilman's awesome laugh.

03:15.767 --> 03:19.167
- EVILMAN:

03:21.967 --> 03:23.633
Where is he?

03:23.733 --> 03:26.100
I hear Evilman's
stupid laugh.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.267
No, no, no.

03:27.367 --> 03:29.267
Uh, that was just me
trying to find

03:29.367 --> 03:32.167
my signature
supervillain laugh.

03:32.267 --> 03:33.700
So what do you
think of this?

03:33.800 --> 03:37.200
Ha. Ha. Ha.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.267
- I like that.
But not the other one.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.833
That laugh, and anything
to do with Evilman,

03:42.933 --> 03:45.900
is forbidden in this house.

03:48.900 --> 03:51.200
- I've never seen him
move that fast.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.333
- Or get that mad.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.633
So, when are you
goin' out with Link?

03:55.733 --> 03:58.133
I'm cancelling right now.

03:58.233 --> 03:59.600
- No, Phoebe, you've
gotta go out with him.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.467
Then me and his dad
can become evil besties

04:02.567 --> 04:05.933
and I'll inherit
his ice base, huh?

04:06.067 --> 04:07.600
Thirty acres of frozen evil.

04:07.700 --> 04:10.300
It's the ultimate
supervillain lair.

04:12.533 --> 04:14.767
- It smells like a pet store.

04:14.867 --> 04:19.367
- Oh, Phoebe,
you just got burned.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.400
- All right, it's done.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.433
No super cutie for me.

04:28.633 --> 04:31.667
- I'm not losing
my ice base.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.100
"Hey, Link, J.K.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.533
We're totes on for tomorrow."

04:35.633 --> 04:38.133
Smiley. Wink. Heart.

04:38.233 --> 04:41.133
Pft! Girls sound so dumb.

04:41.233 --> 04:43.767
Now what am I gonna wear
to meet Evilman?

04:52.800 --> 04:55.367
- Two hundred and eighty
thousand jumps.

04:55.467 --> 04:57.067
Think you can beat that?

04:59.367 --> 05:02.333
I guess we'll never know.

05:04.067 --> 05:07.067
- WOMAN ANNOUNCING: Alert!
Alert! Package delivered.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.467
- I can't wait to see
what it is.

05:13.567 --> 05:18.400
I hope it is a jump rope.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.733
- Cool. A remote-controlled
helicopter.

05:21.833 --> 05:24.933
- Nora, the box says it's for
somebody named "Pete Fisher."

05:25.067 --> 05:26.800
We can't open this.
We have to tell mom.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.700
- Why do that when we can
just play with it first,

05:29.800 --> 05:33.300
then put it back in the box
and nobody would ever know.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.933
- Not if I call you "Pete
Fisher" for the rest of the day.

05:38.067 --> 05:40.167
- I don't know.
It doesn't sound right.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.867
- I would!

05:45.667 --> 05:47.500
- WOMAN ANNOUNCING:
Alert! Alert!

05:47.600 --> 05:49.300
Son of Evilman approaching.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.667
- Shhh, be cool,
Thunder monitor.

05:54.067 --> 05:56.100
This dude has the key
to my ice base.

05:56.200 --> 06:00.767
Phoebe, Overachievers of America
are at the door for you.

06:00.867 --> 06:04.400
They're a week early.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.233
Of course, they are.

06:10.467 --> 06:13.467
Hey, Link. Link? Link!

06:15.067 --> 06:16.400
How do I look?

06:16.500 --> 06:18.433
Why did you do this?

06:18.533 --> 06:21.800
Ice base.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.667
- Max, you can't
let Evilman's son--

06:23.767 --> 06:25.900
Hey!

06:26.067 --> 06:29.467
Sorry about that.
Doors are weird.

06:29.567 --> 06:31.733
- No worries.
I brought you a gift.

06:31.833 --> 06:34.767
The ketchup that
brought us together.

06:34.867 --> 06:36.100
- Aw...

06:36.200 --> 06:39.900
- Phoebe, are you trying
to say, "Please come in."

06:40.067 --> 06:42.200
- Uh-huh.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.333
Come in.

06:44.433 --> 06:46.100
- MAX: Yes!

06:46.200 --> 06:50.567
I just really love ketchup.

06:50.667 --> 06:51.900
- So, listen,
before we go out,

06:52.067 --> 06:53.933
there's something
you should know.

06:54.067 --> 06:59.167
The reason I have superpowers
is because my dad is...

06:59.267 --> 07:01.300
Evilman.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.700
- PHOEBE & MAX:
Wha

07:04.800 --> 07:06.500
- It's haunted me
my whole life.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.800
But, trust me,
I'm nothing like my dad.

07:08.900 --> 07:10.933
- Look, I believe you, but my
parents would never let me

07:11.067 --> 07:12.900
go out with you if they knew
your dad is Evilman.

07:13.067 --> 07:15.200
So we should just go.
- Okay.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.200
I'll leave this here.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.600
Your dad's Thunderman?!

07:20.700 --> 07:22.700
- Keep your voice down.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.567
- Oh, this is terrible.
My dad hates your dad.

07:24.667 --> 07:25.867
Like hate-hates.

07:25.967 --> 07:29.067
Like even more than
being woken up from naps.

07:29.133 --> 07:31.200
- Our parents never
have to find out.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.667
This is about you and me.

07:32.767 --> 07:35.267
- And maybe an ice base.

07:37.833 --> 07:41.200
- Oh. Hey, guys.
Who's this?

07:41.300 --> 07:43.400
- Hey, Mom, this is Link.

07:43.500 --> 07:47.367
- Hi, Link.
- Hi, I'm...I'm...I'm Link.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.633
- Yes, I heard.

07:49.733 --> 07:51.833
- Uh, we were
just goin' out.

07:51.933 --> 07:55.167
- Oh, that must be your car
in the driveway.

07:55.267 --> 08:00.067
Hank, Phoebe's going out
with a boy who has a car!

08:07.233 --> 08:08.833
- You were wrong before.

08:08.933 --> 08:10.833
That's the fastest
he's ever moved.

08:10.933 --> 08:13.800
- Link.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.433
- Link.
- Link.

08:16.533 --> 08:18.367
- Does Link have
a last name?

08:18.467 --> 08:20.700
- Uh, Link Link.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.833
- Link Link--so you're
named after a panda

08:22.933 --> 08:25.633
and you wanna drive
my daughter around?

08:25.733 --> 08:27.333
- Uh, yes, sir.

08:27.433 --> 08:30.533
Uh, it's very nice to meet you,
sir, Mr. Thunder, sir.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.300
- Hm, you're already
afraid of me.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.600
We're off to a good start.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.833
So, let's check out
this "car."

08:37.933 --> 08:39.367
- Ahem!

08:39.467 --> 08:42.833
- After I put on
some "pants."

08:45.967 --> 08:50.167
Nice car, Link Link.
Got a rearview mirror?

08:50.267 --> 08:52.700
'Cause you never know when
someone's following you.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.067
Watching your every move.
- Ah!

08:56.167 --> 08:57.900
Yeah, yeah, I got
a rearview mirror

08:58.067 --> 08:59.567
and a side view mirror
and even a little mirror

08:59.667 --> 09:00.933
inside the side view mirror.

09:01.067 --> 09:03.267
Is that enough mirrors?
Please like me.

09:03.367 --> 09:06.067
- Okay, Dad, I think Link
has passed your little test.

09:06.133 --> 09:07.967
- You have nothing to
worry about, sir.

09:08.067 --> 09:09.900
My dad even installed
an emergency G.P.S. button

09:10.067 --> 09:11.867
that alerts him to my exact
location of the car

09:11.967 --> 09:13.200
if it breaks down.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.333
- Hm, your dad sounds
like a smart man.

09:15.433 --> 09:17.300
I like him already.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.667
- LINK:

09:23.867 --> 09:27.200
- See you soon, Evilman.

09:29.300 --> 09:34.367
- Uh, I said, let's see if Link
can pass the vision test...man.

09:34.467 --> 09:38.067
- Good point. I'd hate to
see you get blindsided!

09:40.667 --> 09:42.900
- You're doing great!

09:45.967 --> 09:48.433
- On behalf of Captain Nora
and Co-pilot Peter Fisher,

09:48.533 --> 09:50.833
thank you for choosing
ThunderAir.

09:56.433 --> 09:58.800
- We're flying!

09:58.900 --> 10:01.267
Ah, we're crashing!

10:01.367 --> 10:05.233
- Nobody panic!

10:05.333 --> 10:06.767
- It's Mom!

10:06.867 --> 10:08.800
- Everybody panic!

10:08.900 --> 10:10.733
- Hide the evidence!

10:15.433 --> 10:19.333
- Aw, you look so cute.

10:19.433 --> 10:20.867
Have you two seen a package?

10:20.967 --> 10:22.600
Mr. Fisher from
down the street

10:22.700 --> 10:24.633
said it was delivered
here by mistake.

10:24.733 --> 10:27.533
- We haven't seen a thing,
have we, Billy?

10:30.900 --> 10:33.000
- Well, Max swears
he didn't take it,

10:33.100 --> 10:35.033
but I had to
double-check, you know.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.233
Can't trust Max,
but I can trust you guys.

10:41.733 --> 10:45.433
- Congratulations.
Your first crime.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.167
We didn't commit a crime.

10:52.267 --> 10:53.700
- Tell that to the cops
when they come

10:53.800 --> 10:55.133
to take you away
for stealing.

10:55.233 --> 10:57.300
They're gonna throw
the book at ya!

10:59.333 --> 11:02.067
I don't even like it when
books are handed to me.

11:02.133 --> 11:03.600
- All we have to do
is fix the helicopter,

11:03.700 --> 11:06.233
put it back in the box
and say we found it.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.833
We'll be heroes.

11:07.933 --> 11:10.400
- Congratulations,
your first cover-up!

11:18.067 --> 11:20.800
- Okay, Link, you have
my permission

11:20.900 --> 11:22.833
to go out with Phoebe.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.400
Clearly, you were
raised right.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.533
- Okay, Max, as soon
as Evilman gets here,

11:29.633 --> 11:31.500
just tell him
you're a big fan

11:31.600 --> 11:33.267
and he's the father
you never had.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.433
I'll get it! I'll get it!
I'll get it!

11:41.633 --> 11:46.500
Hi, I wanna fan
your father!

11:46.600 --> 11:50.567
Oh, immature!

11:50.667 --> 11:52.133
- Dad, what are you
doing here?

11:52.233 --> 11:54.067
- Your car's emergency
alert went off.

11:54.133 --> 11:55.800
I came here as fast
as I could.

11:58.833 --> 12:00.633
- Come on in, Mr. Link.

12:01.967 --> 12:04.533
It's Mike Evilman,
thank you.

12:04.633 --> 12:08.967
- Wait a minute.
You look familiar.

12:09.067 --> 12:13.300
You're the mattress guy
from those commercials!

12:13.400 --> 12:15.067
I'll put you down!

12:15.167 --> 12:18.667
- BOTH: * On the most comfy
mattress in town *

12:18.767 --> 12:22.100
- Hank Thunderman.
Please, have a seat.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.867
- Well, it's been a pleasure
talking to Link.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.733
He seems like
a very good boy.

12:26.833 --> 12:31.100
- Oh, yes, some might
say too good.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.600
- I have the opposite
problem with my son.

12:33.700 --> 12:37.567
You wanna trade?

12:46.433 --> 12:47.800
- I know that laugh.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.333
- No. No, you don't.

12:49.433 --> 12:51.500
This is a person you're meeting
for the first time.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.600
- You're Evilman!

12:55.800 --> 12:58.133
- You're Thunderman!

13:01.067 --> 13:02.733
- MAX, PHOEBE, LINK:
Uh-oh!

13:02.833 --> 13:04.400
- No, no, no, no, no!

13:04.500 --> 13:07.500
You two are not destroying
another one of my homes!

13:07.600 --> 13:09.967
Or cities.

13:10.067 --> 13:12.300
- Save your sparks,
Electriss.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.967
Link and I were
just leaving.

13:15.067 --> 13:19.100
- You're not leaving.
I am kicking you out!

13:21.733 --> 13:23.867
Evilman's son, Phoebe?
Really?

13:23.967 --> 13:27.833
Oh, you are never to
see that boy again!

13:27.933 --> 13:31.567
- But he's super cutie!
- My ice base!

13:34.600 --> 13:36.933
- I guess I should have waited
until I had my ice base

13:37.067 --> 13:39.567
before I ordered
this ice furniture.

13:41.567 --> 13:43.667
- Hey, Max, I know, uh,
you're pretty bummed,

13:43.767 --> 13:45.333
so I brought you a sandwich.

13:45.433 --> 13:46.867
- Aw, thanks, sis.

13:46.967 --> 13:48.867
- You idiot!
Evilman was in our house!

13:48.967 --> 13:50.967
- I know and the only
thing I could say was

13:51.067 --> 13:52.833
"I wanna fan your father."

13:52.933 --> 13:55.100
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

13:55.200 --> 13:56.333
- Not that--now dad
is freaking out

13:56.433 --> 13:58.633
because his worst enemy
knows where we live.

13:58.733 --> 14:00.933
He's calling the Hero League now
to find out what we should do.

14:01.067 --> 14:02.900
- Oh, I know what
we shouldn't do.

14:03.067 --> 14:04.533
Waste perfectly
good sandwiches!

14:06.167 --> 14:08.067
I'm still gonna eat
that when you leave.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.500
- You're also gonna cover for me

14:09.600 --> 14:11.700
so I can go sneak out and see
Link one last time.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.200
- After what happened,

14:13.300 --> 14:15.400
how do you know he wants
to see you again?

14:19.667 --> 14:21.533
Aw...

14:25.900 --> 14:28.100
- Okay, I'll do it for love.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.400
- Yeah.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.733
The love of that ice base.
- I'll take it.

14:36.067 --> 14:37.600
- So you're really
gonna help her?

14:37.700 --> 14:39.800
- No.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.500
I'm gonna rat out
those lovebirds.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.067
Then dad will need Evilman
to track down Link's car

14:44.167 --> 14:45.833
and I can finally meet him.

14:45.933 --> 14:47.833
- Didn't you already
meet Evilman?

14:47.933 --> 14:50.067
- That didn't count!

14:51.367 --> 14:53.233
- Just melt this spinny thing
to the pointy thing

14:53.333 --> 14:56.367
and we can stay out
of the jaily thing.

14:57.967 --> 15:00.100
Done. Let's make
sure it works.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.733
- I don't wanna be
Pete Fisher any more.

15:13.433 --> 15:14.767
- Our intel indicates
that Evilman

15:14.867 --> 15:16.700
has been retired
for over ten years

15:16.800 --> 15:18.367
and poses no threat.

15:18.467 --> 15:20.067
Has he done anything wrong?

15:20.100 --> 15:23.800
- His son asked
my daughter out.

15:23.900 --> 15:28.133
- Okay, this is the Hero League
emergency number, Thunderman,

15:28.233 --> 15:31.600
not the Desperate Dad
Helpline.

15:33.333 --> 15:37.800
- Oh, I have it right...here.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.900
- Wait!

15:40.067 --> 15:42.067
- Dad, Phoebe snuck out
to meet Link.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.467
- But we've gotta find Evilman
so we can track down Link's car.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.567
- Oh, he's probably
at his mattress store.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.467
Thunderman, away!

15:51.467 --> 15:54.067
- All right. I'm gettin'
a second chance.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.733
You're Max Thunderman.

15:55.833 --> 15:57.700
He's lucky to
be meeting you!

16:01.200 --> 16:03.767
- I hate being
woken up from naps!

16:05.400 --> 16:08.367
- Hi, I'm Carl Callaghan.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.667
Where'd that even come from?

16:11.767 --> 16:14.833
- Your evil spawn ran
off with my daughter.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.100
- Impossible!

16:17.200 --> 16:20.300
I told him to stay away from
that goody-two-shoes.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.567
I'm putting an end
to this right now.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.567
- Ho, not if I put
an end to it first!

16:25.667 --> 16:26.833
- Um, I've got the phone

16:26.933 --> 16:29.167
that can track down Link's
car and their location.

16:29.267 --> 16:31.333
- I allow you to proceed.

16:31.433 --> 16:34.100
Oh, thank you.

16:35.933 --> 16:40.100
They're at some terribly-named
place called Splatburger.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.133
- Thunderman, away!

16:42.233 --> 16:44.500
- Evilman, rise!

16:45.700 --> 16:48.800
- Max, catching the bus!

16:50.300 --> 16:52.200
- Remember, we got rid
of the evidence.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.667
So we're in the clear.
Just be cool.

16:54.767 --> 16:57.533
- Don't worry. I am totally
cool under pressure.

16:57.633 --> 17:01.667
- Freeze right there.
- Ahhhhh, they found us!

17:04.767 --> 17:07.500
- I thought I heard
my little angels.

17:07.600 --> 17:11.200
Oh, hello, officer.
What's going on?

17:11.300 --> 17:12.733
- It's all my fault!

17:12.833 --> 17:14.733
We lied and stole Pete Fisher's
toy then broke it.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.800
- Then we fixed it.
- Then we blew it up.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.067
- Then we buried
it out back.

17:19.167 --> 17:20.800
- Please don't let him
take us to kid jail.

17:20.900 --> 17:24.333
- Billy and Nora, I can't
believe you lied to me.

17:24.433 --> 17:28.200
Officer, I am so sorry.
- I'm sorry, too, ma'am.

17:28.300 --> 17:31.100
- That you're not
eating a hot dog!

17:33.333 --> 17:35.133
- I'm from the new
restaurant Cop Dog

17:35.233 --> 17:37.533
and I'm here to protect
and serve you...

17:37.633 --> 17:39.067
this coupon!

17:39.167 --> 17:41.433
Have a hot doggity day.

17:46.433 --> 17:50.467
- So, wonder who
made this mess?

17:55.367 --> 17:56.967
- I'm gonna win this one.
- Yes.

17:57.067 --> 17:58.667
No.
- No, you're not.

17:58.767 --> 18:00.267
Thank you.
- Thanks.

18:00.367 --> 18:01.700
Aw, they forgot the ice.

18:01.800 --> 18:06.533
- Oh, I got this.

18:06.633 --> 18:08.633
- Thanks.

18:11.067 --> 18:15.233
- Just a little superpower fun.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.400
- I never get to
do stuff like this.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.167
I always have to pretend to be
normal when I'm out.

18:19.267 --> 18:20.967
- I know.
Normal's so boring.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.433
My dad's a mattress
salesman now.

18:22.533 --> 18:24.733
He basically sleeps
while he works.

18:24.833 --> 18:26.533
- Oh, my dad's retired,
so he basically

18:26.633 --> 18:29.067
sleeps on the couch
until it's time to go to bed.

18:31.067 --> 18:33.233
- Are you worried about us
getting caught together?

18:33.333 --> 18:35.333
- Nah, if there's one thing
my brother's good at--

18:35.433 --> 18:37.233
it's lying to our parents.

18:41.533 --> 18:44.167
- And apparently to me.

18:44.267 --> 18:47.433
- There they are!
- I saw them first!

18:51.067 --> 18:52.833
- So much in common.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.367
- Oh!
- Eeeh!

18:58.467 --> 19:01.100
- Phoebe, you are
in big trouble.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.200
- And I explicitly
forbid you

19:03.300 --> 19:05.267
from seeing this
good girl again.

19:05.367 --> 19:06.633
Because
of your issues?

19:06.733 --> 19:08.833
We're not you.
Why can't we hang out?

19:08.933 --> 19:13.067
- Your daughter
is manipulating my son.

19:13.100 --> 19:14.333
- Oooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

19:14.433 --> 19:16.467
You're so lucky there's
all these people around.

19:16.567 --> 19:20.167
- Since when did I ever
care about people?

19:20.267 --> 19:22.167
Wear the tube, boob!

19:22.267 --> 19:24.267
- Dad! No!
- Don't!

19:24.367 --> 19:26.067
- Don't do this, please!

19:26.167 --> 19:28.667
- Food fight!

19:32.967 --> 19:34.833
- Eat chicken, turkey face!

19:37.767 --> 19:39.900
- Hope you like cupcakes,
cupcake!

19:44.367 --> 19:46.933
- Looks like it's nacho day!

19:52.633 --> 19:55.300
- I'm gonna knock
your guac off.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.967
- Enough!
Stop behaving like children!

20:04.067 --> 20:06.433
- BOTH: He started it!

20:07.933 --> 20:10.933
- Do you guys realize how
much you have in common?

20:11.033 --> 20:12.500
You both hung up your capes.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.333
You moved your families
to the suburbs.

20:14.433 --> 20:15.967
And you both sleep all day.

20:16.067 --> 20:18.233
You're basically
the same person.

20:18.333 --> 20:20.333
- I have better hair.

20:20.433 --> 20:22.467
- Well, I'm a beloved
local TV celebrity.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.367
- LINK & PHOEBE: Dad.

20:24.467 --> 20:28.833
- Fine, but only because
I hate wasting food.

20:32.567 --> 20:34.500
The fact that you're willing
to put down your tube

20:34.600 --> 20:36.167
makes me realize that...

20:36.267 --> 20:38.500
you're defenseless!

20:38.600 --> 20:42.900
Hasta la vista, baby!
- PHOEBE: No!

20:47.733 --> 20:51.233
- Ha, the weird
kid got it!

20:55.267 --> 20:58.333
- Look, Dad, I'm sorry
I lied, but...

20:58.433 --> 21:00.067
Link and I really like each
other and you were

21:00.167 --> 21:02.400
trying to keep us apart
because of your past.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.100
- You guys are right.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.133
We should be
apologizing to you.

21:06.233 --> 21:08.233
You're not...us.

21:08.333 --> 21:11.700
- Yeah, we're not even
us any more.

21:11.800 --> 21:12.967
Look at this.

21:13.067 --> 21:15.167
We couldn't even destroy
this tacky restaurant.

21:15.267 --> 21:17.867
- Well, since you're
old and sleepy,

21:17.967 --> 21:19.667
how about you give
me your ice base?

21:19.767 --> 21:23.300
- Oh, I sold that to open
up my mattress store.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.233
- Mattresses aren't evil.

21:25.333 --> 21:26.367
- Try lyin' on mine.

21:26.467 --> 21:29.067
It's like a boulder
with a sheet on it.

21:29.100 --> 21:31.067
You should come on by.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.500
- Oooh.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.733
- I will put you down on...

21:34.833 --> 21:38.300
- BOTH: * The most comfy
mattress in town *

21:43.167 --> 21:45.367
- Did we just end
a lifelong feud?

21:45.467 --> 21:48.700
- And it only cost you $372!

21:50.800 --> 21:52.867
- Don't worry, ha,
I got this.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.300
My dad's wallet.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.767
I'm a little evil.

22:01.867 --> 22:03.433
We'll split it.

22:03.533 --> 22:05.067
My brother's wallet.

22:05.133 --> 22:07.067
- Ahhhh...

22:10.333 --> 22:26.200
- *
