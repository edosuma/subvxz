00:01.169 --> 00:02.830
Previously on Farscape.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.376
What is the matter?

00:04.463 --> 00:05.919
Radiation.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.292
Massive radiation.

00:07.383 --> 00:08.372
I love you.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.207
I love you.

00:11.304 --> 00:13.670
Crais:
The ah, other Crichton.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.265
He's dead.

00:15.808 --> 00:16.763
Hello, John.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.432
D'Argo:
Oh, my friend. |...

00:18.519 --> 00:20.350
this is difficult, isn't it?

00:20.438 --> 00:22.724
You're jealous of
the other you.

00:22.815 --> 00:25.852
He died. Now Aeryn thinks
that you're the copy.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.729
Peacekeepers.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.403
They're your problem.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.401
Don't let Scorpius crack this.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.153
Whatever it takes.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.451
I'm going to the
Command Carrier.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.620
I'm going to stop Scorpius.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.663
Good luck, John.

00:45.588 --> 00:49.752
And now on Farscape.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.333
Jool:
I'm a squillion metres from
anywhere I wanna be.

00:52.428 --> 00:54.965
Then come with me.

00:57.183 --> 00:58.218
I can't.

00:58.309 --> 01:02.302
Jool, your friends are
negotiating with Peacekeepers.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.433
You stay here,
you'll end up dead.

01:05.524 --> 01:08.015
I'm sure on the
medical facility,

01:08.110 --> 01:12.695
there'll be someone who can
help you find your home.

01:13.449 --> 01:14.950
Aeryn aboard?

01:15.034 --> 01:17.366
Pilot:
Just finished her
reconnaissance.

01:17.453 --> 01:21.162
The ship on approach is
definitely a medical facility.

01:21.249 --> 01:25.162
It is unarmed, five or six
hundred on board.
And they'll take our Scarran.

01:25.253 --> 01:28.290
Let's get Naj Gil out of here
before they change their minds.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.007
You all right?

01:35.012 --> 01:36.593
Any word from D'Argo and Rygel?

01:36.681 --> 01:38.091
No, they're out of range.

01:38.182 --> 01:41.049
So after we leave here,
we're really going to do this?

01:41.143 --> 01:42.644
There's no turning back.
We're...

01:42.728 --> 01:45.390
We're gonna go on a Command
Carrier with Scorpius.

01:45.481 --> 01:47.437
Well, that's the plan, if they
can hammer out a deal.

01:47.525 --> 01:49.481
Scorpius doesn't deal.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.695
Rygel thinks he will.

01:51.779 --> 01:56.022
No, no, no. Right now, Scorpius
is probably frying D'Argo
in the Aurora Chair.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.529
A-a-and then he's gonna find us
and he's gonna kick us to death!

01:58.619 --> 02:00.200
But... but you know what?

02:00.288 --> 02:03.155
It doesn't matter because
lwon't be here.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.202
l'm splittin' Crichton.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.330
The next planet we pass.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.799
Peacekeepers.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.676
I... | see Peacekeepers.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.602
You know, I don't think
Scorpius is going to show.

02:30.693 --> 02:34.026
He'll show. Eat, calm down.

02:34.113 --> 02:35.228
No, I can't.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.154
I smell a double cross.

02:37.241 --> 02:41.701
How can you smell anything with
these ganoks on the table?

02:42.204 --> 02:43.239
Try one.

02:43.331 --> 02:46.289
No. How can you eat that?
It smells like pralt.

02:46.375 --> 02:52.120
They're our specialty.
People come from planets you've
never heard of, just to eat our marjools.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.956
Look, can you please just
get out of my way?

02:55.051 --> 02:57.633
Go, go! Go!
-Ah, they're here.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.294
Lieutenant.

03:00.931 --> 03:03.058
Just the two of you?

03:03.142 --> 03:04.257
No others?

03:04.352 --> 03:07.094
Correct. Where's Scorpius?

03:08.647 --> 03:11.138
Ah, the Luxan.

03:14.445 --> 03:16.310
And the Dominar.

03:16.405 --> 03:17.611
( chuckles )

03:17.698 --> 03:18.938
You're late.

03:19.033 --> 03:22.446
I presume you're both unarmed.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.743
That was the deal.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.536
Yes, it was.

03:26.624 --> 03:28.865
Shall we get down to business?

03:28.959 --> 03:31.120
Not yet.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.168
( banging )
Rygel, move! It's a trap!

03:33.255 --> 03:34.631
(grunts)

03:36.217 --> 03:37.297
(weapons charging )

03:46.977 --> 03:48.353
Lieutenant.

03:48.938 --> 03:51.304
Prepare to execute them.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.685
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

03:57.780 --> 04:01.489
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

04:01.575 --> 04:03.156
I'm trying to stay alive...

04:03.244 --> 04:05.155
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

04:05.246 --> 04:07.953
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.496
If you can hear me...
Beware.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.574
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

04:11.669 --> 04:14.160
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

04:14.255 --> 04:18.965
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.133
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

04:21.220 --> 04:23.927
Not show them...
You exist...

04:24.014 --> 04:27.723
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

04:59.592 --> 05:01.298
Where's your rescue squad?

05:01.385 --> 05:03.250
Hmm?

05:03.345 --> 05:04.846
Where's Aeryn Sun?

05:04.930 --> 05:06.431
Get frelled.

05:08.392 --> 05:09.723
Not afraid of death?

05:09.810 --> 05:12.597
Oh, just let me finish these.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.474
Then please, don't miss.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.305
Aim for the head, hmm?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.140
( chuckles )

05:21.363 --> 05:23.194
Look, we're ready to deal.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.364
When you've finished your
little game.

05:25.451 --> 05:30.070
I had to make sure you
were both... alone.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.200
Mmm, of course.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.781
Weapons down.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.873
(grunts)

05:45.513 --> 05:47.344
So...

05:48.432 --> 05:49.797
(grunts)

05:51.519 --> 05:54.261
You weren't really going
to kill us?

05:54.355 --> 05:55.140
Of course not.

05:55.231 --> 05:56.516
(grunts)

05:59.527 --> 06:03.111
Are you certain about that?

06:03.197 --> 06:04.653
Quite.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.105
Ah, Ka-D'Argo.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.067
If you knockout another,

06:09.161 --> 06:12.278
there'll be no soldiers to carry
these three back to the ship.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.204
Rygel:
He's right.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.373
We're here to talk.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.085
Okay.

06:21.131 --> 06:24.589
But I want no Comms and
no more surprises.

06:36.564 --> 06:40.148
Now get these tralks out of here
before you start to waste...

06:40.234 --> 06:42.316
any more of my time.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.654
Hmm.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.229
Braca:
Withdraw to the ship.
Await our return. -Peacekeepers!

06:47.324 --> 06:49.610
Esssk:
Well, what are we gonna do?
-Get the frellhezmana out of here.

06:49.702 --> 06:51.909
I'm not going out there.
No way.

06:52.204 --> 06:53.319
Vooodi!

06:53.414 --> 06:55.120
Oh, zangblats!

06:55.207 --> 06:56.162
Shh!

06:56.250 --> 06:57.740
We gotta run, Esssk.
We gotta run.

06:57.835 --> 06:59.120
What? Run where? Where?!

06:59.211 --> 07:01.418
Like we've got somewhere to run?

07:10.639 --> 07:11.970
Naj Gil!

07:12.057 --> 07:13.342
Has he gone yet?

07:13.434 --> 07:16.221
Yeah, the Transport Pod just
left for the Med Ship.

07:16.312 --> 07:17.848
What are you doing?

07:17.938 --> 07:21.180
Listen Chi, I've got nothing
against the Peacekeepers.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.266
I was never a prisoner.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.275
So you guys want to fight 'em,
or stop 'em, or whatever it is
you're planning, fine.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.901
Good luck. But I'm leaving.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.903
Ah, you're going on
the Med Ship?

07:31.994 --> 07:34.952
Yup. Naj Gil said they'd check
out my eye, and then they're
gonna take me home.

07:35.039 --> 07:37.200
You can't go.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.155
Why not?

07:38.250 --> 07:40.115
Because I saw myself
mourning for you.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.201
Okay. One, I don't think
you can see dren,

07:42.296 --> 07:44.287
and two, it's really none of...

07:47.509 --> 07:49.841
Let me understand.

07:49.928 --> 07:53.637
You wish to board my
Command Carrier?

07:53.724 --> 07:59.185
You want full amnesty and
relocation to your own planets
as free citizens.

07:59.271 --> 08:06.985
And in return, Crichton will
help me in my wormhole
research?

08:07.071 --> 08:09.278
That's about the short
of it, yes.

08:09.365 --> 08:11.276
And why would Crichton do this?

08:12.534 --> 08:15.321
Do you know who the
Charrids are?

08:15.412 --> 08:17.664
Yes.

08:17.748 --> 08:20.831
Not very friendly towards
Hynerians, ifl recall.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.534
The Charrids have formed an
alliance with the Scarrans.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.870
I am aware of the political
situation.

08:25.964 --> 08:29.627
The Scarrans' goal is to build
wormhole technology.

08:29.718 --> 08:33.836
We stopped them, but it won't
belong until they start again.

08:33.931 --> 08:37.344
So Crichton has a choice,

08:37.434 --> 08:41.973
and he would rather you
had it than them.

08:42.064 --> 08:43.349
We've got to get them
out of here.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.771
So what are you gonna do?

08:44.858 --> 08:47.065
Esssk, I've got to tell
you something.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.186
(grunting)

08:50.280 --> 08:52.362
Oh, don't worry. This could
turn out good.

08:52.449 --> 08:56.408
If you cook 'em the greatest
Leearvink ever, maybe...

08:56.495 --> 08:58.451
we could get a Peacekeeper
supply contract...

08:58.539 --> 09:00.120
No, we're going to get killed.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.415
No, no, no. Why would
they kill us?

09:05.129 --> 09:07.120
I... I don't know how to
make Leearvink.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.000
I haven't got the skills.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.877
You do. You do.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.129
You were a great chef
once, Vooodi.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.802
You...

09:15.889 --> 09:17.265
can do it.

09:17.349 --> 09:21.433
Crichton, Aeryn, there are
Peacekeepers approaching.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.307
Chiana:
I knew it. I knew Peacekeepers
were coming.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.559
Come on. Come on.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.141
What, did you see that too? Is
there anything you don't see?
-Nice.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.648
Talyn has also spotted the
Peacekeeper craft.

09:31.739 --> 09:32.945
A Prowler and a Marauder.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.771
Pilot, give us immediate
Starburst!

09:34.867 --> 09:38.451
We cannot Starburst until
we are clear of the
Medical Facility.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.698
Talyn, prime the main canon.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.201
Identify targets and stay calm.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.498
Stay calm, Talyn.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.450
Are the Peacekeepers
here to find us?

09:46.545 --> 09:47.705
I don't know.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.412
Chiana:
Crichton, it's Scorpius.
He sent them.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.122
I told you. I told you
they would screw us.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.333
That means that D'Argo
and Rygel are dead.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.588
Pip, we do not know that.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.215
What are you doing?

09:57.306 --> 09:59.012
You bitch, I could be gone.
I could be on that Med Ship.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.431
But no, you had to see things.
And then you punched me!

10:01.518 --> 10:03.474
Prime main canons only.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.348
Do not fire until my signal.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.646
Peacekeeper ships in
visual range.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.724
Moya senses they've
targeted us.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.900
We don't have any choice.
Do it now, Crais.

10:11.987 --> 10:14.444
Talyn, fire at will.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.406
Pilot, status of the
Peacekeeper vessels?

10:22.498 --> 10:25.911
They are no longer
on Moya's scans.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.241
Good work, Talyn.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.167
Starburst in 50 microts.

10:29.254 --> 10:33.998
The Hospital Craft is moving
away and its Commander sends
us his gratitude

10:34.092 --> 10:36.708
for destroying the
Peacekeepers' ships.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.886
Crais:
Wait, wait, Talyn.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.303
The Med Ship is not a threat.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.132
What is he doing, Crais?
-No, Talyn! The Med Ship
is not a threat!

10:43.227 --> 10:45.013
Crais, what is going on
out there?

10:45.103 --> 10:46.604
Crais:
No, Talyn!

10:46.688 --> 10:50.306
No, Talyn, no! Power down now!

11:01.578 --> 11:04.820
( panting )
You!

11:04.915 --> 11:09.329
There were innocent people
aboard that ship! Naj Gil!
-I know. There was nothing I could do.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.250
Talyn attacked on his
own accord.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.750
You coulda stopped him.
-Jool.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.173
Somehow, you coulda
stopped him.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.255
Now they're dead.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.052
Six hundred souls.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.675
And you!

11:24.601 --> 11:25.852
You knew.

11:25.936 --> 11:29.144
No. l... I only saw myself
in mourning.

11:29.231 --> 11:31.847
I thought it was for you.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.604
Crichton:
Pilot, why haven't we Starburst?

11:34.695 --> 11:37.152
Peacekeepers are sure to
send out another patrol.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.695
I'm afraid...

11:38.782 --> 11:41.819
Moya is now refusing to move.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.320
Why?

11:43.412 --> 11:46.620
Since Talyn powered down,
I can't contact him.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.619
He's not responding
to my Comms.

11:49.710 --> 11:53.248
And Moya is refusing
to abandon him.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.879
We are agreed.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.799
You will all board my
Command Carrier.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.252
We're not quite finished yet.

12:01.346 --> 12:05.305
We will need a guarantee for
our safety when we're
onboard your ship.

12:05.392 --> 12:11.012
And I'm afraid we'll need
something more tangible than
reassuring words.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.690
I-Yensch bracelets.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.235
Sir.

12:20.032 --> 12:22.114
Put one on, Braca.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.946
Ka-D'Argo?

12:25.454 --> 12:27.319
If you will.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.870
What does it do?

12:28.957 --> 12:31.164
This gets you onboard my ship.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.742
Rygel:
We have almost closed the deal.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.168
Put it on.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.086
That's easy for you to say.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.793
Do you feel anything?

12:44.348 --> 12:46.179
No.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.850
Braca, pay homage to
the Dominar.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.143
What?

12:57.319 --> 13:01.062
Scorpius:
I invite you, Dominar,
to attack the Lieutenant.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.147
I have no quarrel with him.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.368
Humor me.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.996
(grunts)

13:12.084 --> 13:13.119
( laughs )

13:13.210 --> 13:15.201
Synchronized nerve impulses.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.128
Those wearing the bracelets
will feel each other's pain.

13:18.215 --> 13:21.799
If one is injured,
then both will be.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.836
Very good.
And if one is killed?

13:26.598 --> 13:28.509
Both will be dead.

13:28.600 --> 13:34.266
Uh huh. The bracelets seem
acceptable, but who wears them?

13:34.356 --> 13:36.312
Well, Crichton, of course.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.265
And my second in command,
Braca.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.349
Braca!

13:39.444 --> 13:41.560
You would not hesitate
to kill him.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.941
Scorpius:
I will not wear an
I-Yensch bracelet.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.739
Rygel:
Crichton wears one,
you wear one.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.284
Each of us gets to configure
the arming sequence

13:49.371 --> 13:52.113
so we can be assured
there's no tampering.

13:52.207 --> 13:57.076
The only way we'll trust you,
Scorpius, is if we know we
can control you.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.285
Unacceptable.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.541
Then we have no deal.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.247
So be it.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.582
(door bursts open)

14:03.677 --> 14:05.588
(yelling)

14:08.932 --> 14:10.297
Get down! Down!

14:16.273 --> 14:17.729
This is a robbery.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.226
( growls )

14:21.069 --> 14:22.275
How many more are there, huh?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.272
There's no one!

14:29.995 --> 14:32.111
Manon, grillas, whatever
you've got.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.117
Give it to me in a pile,
nice and slow.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.914
I have nothing.

14:37.002 --> 14:39.459
Sko! I'm trying to tell
you something.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.207
( squawking )

14:41.298 --> 14:42.333
I know.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.210
They're Peacekeeper officers.
Who gives a frell?

14:44.301 --> 14:46.337
He never told us about
the Peacekeepers.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.669
(We and Sko squawking)

14:48.764 --> 14:50.550
You. You!

14:50.640 --> 14:52.301
Up, up, up, up.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.132
Up, up, up, up.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.972
We go out there now...

14:57.064 --> 14:58.224
your troops...

14:58.315 --> 14:59.475
they shoot us in the head.
How many?

14:59.566 --> 15:00.601
How many are there?

15:00.692 --> 15:01.898
None.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.816
( squawking )
A liar!

15:03.904 --> 15:06.646
Peacekeeper Officer can't even
stiv without his troops.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.698
I can stiv on my own,
thank you very much.

15:11.203 --> 15:11.862
Up, up.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.033
Up, up, up.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.281
Up!

15:14.956 --> 15:16.492
You, Comm them.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.164
Tell them show themselves.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.331
Hands up in the air.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.707
I have no Comms.
The Luxan destroyed them.

15:29.096 --> 15:29.801
( screaming )

15:29.888 --> 15:31.298
( hooting )

15:31.389 --> 15:32.424
Why did you hit me?!

15:32.516 --> 15:34.347
Wh-What did I do?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.049
You, just go.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.554
Cook!
-What?

15:37.646 --> 15:39.637
Now, you go help him cook. Now!

15:39.731 --> 15:40.891
What?
-I don't care what!

15:40.982 --> 15:42.233
Go, go, go.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.521
( screaming )

15:50.408 --> 15:51.989
(groaning)

15:52.077 --> 15:53.487
( snorting )

15:58.208 --> 16:00.494
What's going on?
What's going on?

16:00.585 --> 16:02.576
What's going on?!
What's going on?

16:02.671 --> 16:06.129
That's a long story, freII-jek.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.877
(sighs)

16:07.968 --> 16:11.381
Crais:
Talyn is in shock.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.383
He has expressed absolute
remorse for his mistake.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.430
Six hundred dead.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.804
That's a little more than
a mistake, Crais.

16:18.895 --> 16:22.513
Yes. And I believe that unless
we act, it may happen again.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.347
What will happen again?

16:24.442 --> 16:26.603
Extreme paranoia.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.560
Reactions unwarranted
to the situation.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.193
Talyn is a danger to himself,
as well as us.

16:32.284 --> 16:35.902
Crichton:
Crais, what do you wanna do?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.332
IbeHeve”.

16:43.753 --> 16:46.244
we should shut down all his
mechanoid systems.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.547
(loud rumbling)

16:49.634 --> 16:51.545
Pilot:
Stay calm, Moya.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.127
We're just discussing a plan.

16:54.222 --> 16:57.305
No one's doing anything yet.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.303
Are you talking about
killing Talyn?

16:59.394 --> 17:01.430
Of course not.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.979
His biologics will remain
on artificial support.

17:05.066 --> 17:09.730
But we must get him to a place
where the anomalies in his
character can be repaired.

17:09.821 --> 17:12.198
Then you'll bring him back?

17:12.282 --> 17:14.113
With full system replacement.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.567
(loud rumbling)

17:18.496 --> 17:21.488
When he comes back,
will he still be Talyn?

17:24.211 --> 17:25.917
No.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.619
He will be, uh...

17:28.590 --> 17:30.421
different.

17:30.508 --> 17:31.839
Brand new.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.259
But something has to be done.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.554
Moya must know that.

17:39.434 --> 17:42.847
600 innocents have just
lost their lives.

17:42.938 --> 17:47.398
Pilot:
Moya is aware that Talyn
has acted irrationally.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.442
I will speak to her. Alone.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.235
U Rygel:
h... (coughing)

17:53.323 --> 17:55.154
Could I offer a suggestion?

17:55.242 --> 17:56.698
Shut up!
(squawking)

17:56.785 --> 17:59.618
Why don't you forget the
robbery and think bigger?

17:59.704 --> 18:03.367
If I were you, I'd hold the
Peacekeepers for ransom.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.414
Let us go. You don't need us.

18:05.502 --> 18:08.118
But they'll pay anything to
get those two back.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.124
Rygel, shut up!

18:10.215 --> 18:14.709
Rygel:
This robbery doesn't seem to be
turning out like you planned.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.259
If you had a plan which...
( squawking )

18:16.346 --> 18:19.179
don't get upset, doesn't
seem to be the case.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.472
We're doing fine.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.968
This is fine?

18:22.060 --> 18:24.096
I'd hate to see when
you do badly.

18:25.689 --> 18:30.399
When we burn this place down,
(hooting ) I'll make sure
you're in it!

18:30.485 --> 18:31.691
( screeching )

18:31.778 --> 18:33.234
Burn it down?

18:33.321 --> 18:35.607
I thought you were robbing it.

18:35.699 --> 18:38.065
This isn't a robbery, is it?

18:38.159 --> 18:39.990
It's for insurance.

18:40.078 --> 18:42.740
Garanzai currency, yes?

18:42.831 --> 18:47.325
Before, you said he didn't
tell us there would be
Peacekeepers here.

18:47.419 --> 18:49.455
It's the cook.
( laughing )

18:49.546 --> 18:52.959
You're burning it down
for the cook.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.335
Vooodi, get out here now!

18:56.344 --> 18:58.460
(chittering )

18:58.555 --> 18:59.920
We've got your food.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.755
Get it out of my face!
-We've got Leearvink.

19:01.850 --> 19:05.308
( squawking )
I'll just put it over there,
okay? Maybe your friend will...

19:07.188 --> 19:08.268
(whispering ):
He knows.

19:08.356 --> 19:11.189
What did you tell him?
What did you tell him?!

19:11.276 --> 19:12.356
What did you tell him?!

19:12.444 --> 19:13.854
( squawks )

19:15.530 --> 19:17.395
Tell what?

19:17.949 --> 19:19.234
The worm knows.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.318
Vooodi hired us to burn
this place down.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.902
Esssk:
You did what?

19:23.997 --> 19:26.033
I would have told you.
I should have, Esssk, but...

19:26.124 --> 19:27.864
You want to burn this?
-But... I wanted to tell you...

19:27.959 --> 19:30.245
But I love this place, Voodi!
-I should have told you!

19:30.337 --> 19:32.248
Shut up! Shut up!

19:32.339 --> 19:35.831
( screeching )

19:35.925 --> 19:38.507
What have you been doing?
Have you been telling him
my life story?

19:38.595 --> 19:40.927
I didn't. He guessed.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.093
He came up with a better plan.

19:44.184 --> 19:49.474
Instead of doing the insurance
job, we take these two for
ransom instead.

19:49.564 --> 19:51.304
( squawks )
-I wouldn't do that.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.685
Sko:
We don't care what you'd do.

19:53.777 --> 19:56.814
Look, we've got the guns.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.190
We're in control.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.067
And we're gonna be rich.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.240
Rich! Rich, Rich, Rich!

20:02.327 --> 20:03.692
No you won't.

20:03.787 --> 20:07.325
(squawking and screeching )

20:07.415 --> 20:11.249
Talyn has activated a full
lockdown. He's not letting
Crais on board.

20:11.336 --> 20:15.045
Moya is still refusing to move.
She won't even talk to Pilot.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.087
What do you think we should do?

20:19.386 --> 20:21.047
You're asking me?

20:22.389 --> 20:23.845
Yes.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.140
We can still work
together, John.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.183
We always did that well.

20:31.439 --> 20:36.479
The only voice that Talyn is
gonna listen to is Moya.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.315
Someone needs to talk to her
and convince her

20:39.406 --> 20:42.239
that we're not hurting Talyn
because we want to.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.283
Ithink...

20:46.371 --> 20:50.410
maybe you should talk to Moya.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.872
She knows that you love Talyn.

20:56.798 --> 20:58.789
There's nothing I can do.

20:58.883 --> 21:05.971
Moya knows Talyn's acting
irrationally, but she believes
he will heal himself.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.139
May I speak with her?

21:08.226 --> 21:09.841
I'll ask.

21:11.855 --> 21:14.016
Moya will listen to you.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.643
Proceed.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.225
( clears throat)

21:21.030 --> 21:22.895
Hello, Moya.

21:26.244 --> 21:28.860
Talyn has been our home,

21:28.955 --> 21:33.915
and on more than one occasion,
he has saved our lives.

21:34.002 --> 21:38.712
I personally have shared with
him some of the best

21:38.798 --> 21:42.165
and also some of the
worst times.

21:42.260 --> 21:45.752
You must know that I would
never harm him.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.089
Crais is right.

21:49.184 --> 21:52.768
We have to shut Talyn down,
and it is for his own good.

21:52.854 --> 21:58.440
And I swear that we will all
work to bring him back
just as he was.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.904
(rumbling)

22:03.406 --> 22:05.397
It is the only way.

22:06.242 --> 22:07.982
(rumbling)

22:11.706 --> 22:14.823
Sko:
I can handle Peacekeepers.
I know what they'll do.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.124
( squawking )

22:16.211 --> 22:19.203
They'll send out a Prowler,
maybe two.

22:19.297 --> 22:25.338
But I'll keep this gun at your
head to make sure there's no
funny ganak.

22:25.428 --> 22:29.421
Then you'll organize a ransom
and get them to give you
a very fast ship?

22:29.516 --> 22:31.848
That's right.

22:31.935 --> 22:34.142
The moment you Comm them,
you're dead.

22:34.229 --> 22:37.312
And you won't even see
them coming.

22:37.398 --> 22:43.109
Why risk it, when you have a
far greater prize here and you
don't even know it?

22:43.196 --> 22:47.155
Behold, Rygel the Sixteenth,
Sovereign of Hyneria,

22:47.242 --> 22:49.949
heir to all of its wealth and
fabled star planets.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.620
He, you should ransom.

22:57.293 --> 23:01.787
Pilot:
Talyn's agreed to let Crais
reboard and start his work.

23:01.881 --> 23:05.794
I sense Talyn waking up from
Iockdown and powering up.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.341
Thank Moya for us, Pilot.

23:07.428 --> 23:11.137
I think it best to
leave Moya alone.

23:11.224 --> 23:15.558
She knows what we do is
necessary, but still...

23:15.645 --> 23:17.556
she is heartbroken.

23:17.647 --> 23:19.387
She's not the only one.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.101
Crais?

23:21.192 --> 23:22.693
What's Talyn doing?

23:22.777 --> 23:24.142
He's aiming at us.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.728
Start evasive procedures.
-Shut down, Talyn! Shut down!

23:26.823 --> 23:28.313
Evasive procedures now!

23:29.284 --> 23:30.740
( screaming )

23:34.622 --> 23:36.078
( screaming )

23:43.923 --> 23:47.336
D'Argo:
Must... stay awake.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.213
(choked yells)

23:50.430 --> 23:52.170
No, no sleep.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.221
No sleep. No sleep!

23:54.309 --> 23:55.719
(both yell)

23:58.438 --> 23:59.598
( growls )

24:00.565 --> 24:01.930
He needs water.

24:02.025 --> 24:05.267
Ah, shut up!
He's not important.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.443
Let the hostages die.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.566
Brilliant negotiating position.

24:09.657 --> 24:14.321
Oh, you're the only one we care
about little slime toad.

24:14.412 --> 24:17.279
Now, shut up!

24:17.373 --> 24:19.364
While we figure out what
to do next.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.825
He needs water now.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.126
(screeching laughter)

24:32.096 --> 24:33.961
Imbecile.

24:34.599 --> 24:35.588
(pounding table)

24:35.683 --> 24:37.344
Bring me water!

24:37.435 --> 24:39.926
And bring me food!

24:40.021 --> 24:41.386
I left your... ( snorts)

24:41.481 --> 24:43.437
...Leearvink on the table.

24:44.734 --> 24:48.226
Well, that Leearvink's cold.

24:48.321 --> 24:51.188
You should bring me some more.

24:55.036 --> 24:57.698
(flatulating )

25:00.208 --> 25:03.200
Yes. I think he bought it.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.295
They want more Leearvink.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.383
Come on!

25:09.467 --> 25:12.174
Why don't they stick their
Leearvink up their fekik?!

25:12.261 --> 25:14.877
No, no, no, why don't we put a
frelling sign out the front?

25:14.972 --> 25:18.339
Huh? Huh? Yeah?
"Leearvink not done here!"

25:18.434 --> 25:20.265
What sign?

25:20.353 --> 25:23.686
You were gonna burn the
place down, Vooodi.
-No!

25:23.773 --> 25:26.731
This place is killing us.
Don't you understand that?

25:26.818 --> 25:28.774
Esssk, I want to start over.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.852
I want to start over together.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.448
I've been thinking about it.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.401
We shouldn't kill anyone.

25:38.496 --> 25:40.703
We should just burn
the place down.

25:40.790 --> 25:43.156
If we do this ransom thing,

25:43.251 --> 25:46.368
you know someone's gonna...
(screech ) ...end up dead.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.625
( both shrieking )

25:49.716 --> 25:51.707
Have you looked in the
mirror lately?

25:51.801 --> 25:53.507
Are you getting any younger?

25:53.594 --> 25:55.255
No!

25:55.346 --> 25:58.179
We take the score that's
fallen in our lap.

25:59.434 --> 26:02.642
We market the runt.

26:02.729 --> 26:06.813
We have only a limited window
before they discover no one
will pay a kretmar for you.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.481
That's your fault.
You told them to ransom me.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.935
If they'd Commed in a
Peacekeeper squad like
you suggested,

26:12.029 --> 26:15.362
it's quite likely one of us
would have died at the
hands of these idiots!

26:16.242 --> 26:18.278
No, uh...

26:19.537 --> 26:21.402
we do this ourselves.

26:21.497 --> 26:22.577
If you're up to it.

26:22.665 --> 26:24.496
( laughs )

26:24.584 --> 26:28.247
I know the combination to
Braca's bracelet.

26:28.337 --> 26:33.252
While holding two lights
continuously, depress 3-1-4.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.628
Then release all.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.335
(sighs)

26:37.430 --> 26:39.011
Hmm...

26:41.893 --> 26:43.633
Give us a hand here, Princess.

26:43.728 --> 26:46.219
I can't believe Talyn
blew up Moya.

26:46.314 --> 26:50.478
I'm sure it was an accident. Bet
he was really aiming for you.

26:50.568 --> 26:51.808
(grunts)

26:55.698 --> 26:58.781
Crais:
We are the only ones
who can help you.

26:58.868 --> 27:01.405
Talyn, please.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.363
Talyn, please!

27:12.381 --> 27:14.292
Bay Three Hangar is opening.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.294
Talyn is letting us dock.

27:17.303 --> 27:20.887
Okay, here's what we do.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.225
We call your people,

27:23.643 --> 27:25.383
W8...

27:25.478 --> 27:29.266
ask for ten million
kretmars ransom.

27:29.357 --> 27:30.767
VVeleave.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.940
We wait.
They come.

27:33.027 --> 27:35.609
When they come, we arrange
the exchange.

27:35.696 --> 27:39.029
His ship will decode the
transmission.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.617
Ha.So?

27:40.701 --> 27:42.111
We'll be metres away.

27:42.203 --> 27:45.866
Rygel:
In something that can outrun
an attack Marauder?

27:46.749 --> 27:48.250
Oh, he's right, you know.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.871
(grunting and screeching )

27:50.962 --> 27:53.203
Oh, why so difficult?

27:53.297 --> 27:54.412
( squawking )

27:54.507 --> 27:56.418
Uh, we could take my ship.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.716
It's fast.
They won't ever catch us.

27:58.803 --> 28:00.009
(snons)
Good.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.428
(chittering )

28:02.515 --> 28:04.130
But he's...

28:04.225 --> 28:06.466
the only one that can fly it.

28:06.561 --> 28:08.176
I don't believe you.

28:08.271 --> 28:10.353
D'Argo:
It's true.

28:10.439 --> 28:13.146
Responds to DNA particles
and voice ident.

28:13.234 --> 28:15.099
( howls )

28:15.194 --> 28:16.695
Why so difficult?!

28:16.779 --> 28:17.689
( screeches )

28:17.780 --> 28:18.940
Here!

28:19.031 --> 28:20.646
Vooodi's made you more
Leearvink.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.652
Smells like krank!

28:22.743 --> 28:24.324
You get me something I can eat!

28:24.412 --> 28:25.492
Esssk:
Let go!

28:25.580 --> 28:28.322
Don't fight me, bitch!
-You hurting me!

28:28.416 --> 28:30.748
Oh! Get the frell outta here!

28:30.835 --> 28:32.666
I want you gone now!

28:32.753 --> 28:33.833
Now!

28:33.921 --> 28:35.252
Get back to the kitchen!

28:35.339 --> 28:38.126
No, this is my place!
You work for me now.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.253
Burn it some other time.
I don't care.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.426
Just get out of here!

28:42.513 --> 28:43.548
Now!

28:43.639 --> 28:45.379
I'm warning you.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.133
Vooodi!

28:49.228 --> 28:51.344
( Esssk sobs )

28:54.358 --> 28:56.895
Why?

28:56.986 --> 29:01.070
( choking ):
I wanted to give you something.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.568
Vooodi.

29:05.995 --> 29:09.328
Burn this place down
in my honor.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.295
(screeching and grunting )

29:28.809 --> 29:30.515
Rygel:
Braca's I-Yensch...

29:30.603 --> 29:32.719
hold two continuously
as you press...

29:32.813 --> 29:33.848
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.146
Oh...

29:35.232 --> 29:38.816
Slime Finger.
What are you doing?

29:38.903 --> 29:41.315
Helping keep this man alive.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.442
Oh, no, you're not!

29:46.619 --> 29:48.200
Get back over there.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.118
Yes, yes.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.616
( inhales deeply)

29:51.707 --> 29:53.288
( coughs )

29:53.376 --> 29:55.241
Rygel (whispering ):
Press 3-1-4.

29:55.336 --> 29:56.621
Mm...

29:58.965 --> 30:00.330
Talyn?

30:01.342 --> 30:05.005
You know what must happen next.

30:07.390 --> 30:09.221
He's right, Talyn.

30:11.978 --> 30:16.096
Talyn, you listen to me.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.647
You destroyed a ship with many
innocent people onboard.

30:18.734 --> 30:22.226
You shot your own mother.
You would never do that,

30:22.321 --> 30:25.438
unless you were sick
and frightened.

30:27.994 --> 30:33.409
When Moya told you what we
had to do, you panicked
and struck out.

30:33.499 --> 30:36.206
I don't think you really
meant to hurt Moya.

30:36.293 --> 30:39.160
You could have destroyed her if
you wanted to, but you didn't.

30:39.255 --> 30:42.042
Just as I'm hoping that you
don't really want to hurt us,

30:42.133 --> 30:44.749
because we don't want
to hurt you.

30:49.140 --> 30:51.381
Talyn, you know you're sick.

30:52.226 --> 30:55.343
You let us board.

30:55.438 --> 30:58.521
Now, I don't want you to
be frightened.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.859
You're not going to die.

31:02.403 --> 31:04.109
You'll be reborn.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.278
It's a fresh start.

31:07.408 --> 31:09.319
Please, Talyn.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.616
Let us take away your pain.

31:30.848 --> 31:32.338
(groaning)

31:34.143 --> 31:35.599
Stay awake.

31:36.312 --> 31:37.301
Stay awake!

31:37.396 --> 31:38.727
(grunt, yell)

31:38.814 --> 31:40.475
Stay awake.

31:43.027 --> 31:47.111
Wa:
Please, Sko, no more killing.
We should just get out of here.

31:47.198 --> 31:49.063
No! No! We are too far in.

31:49.158 --> 31:51.240
So. You!

31:51.327 --> 31:52.316
Rygel:
Yes?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.527
You were meeting with him,
weren't you?

31:54.622 --> 31:56.408
Why?

31:56.499 --> 32:00.583
To negotiate our freedom.
We're escaped prisoners.

32:00.669 --> 32:02.876
Oh, really?! Really?!

32:02.963 --> 32:05.340
Uh-huh.

32:05.424 --> 32:09.212
So, you don't like
Peacekeepers either.

32:09.303 --> 32:11.965
Not in the slightest.

32:13.641 --> 32:16.348
This one's the most valuable?

32:16.435 --> 32:18.346
Higher even than a Captain.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.429
Look. No insignia.

32:21.524 --> 32:24.266
So. We take him in your ship.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.067
We have better chance of
escaping, eh?

32:27.154 --> 32:28.485
Mmm...

32:29.907 --> 32:31.397
( screeches, snorts )

32:32.743 --> 32:33.778
Come!

32:33.869 --> 32:35.484
Come, come, Slimey!
(groaning)

32:35.579 --> 32:37.115
Wa! Wa!

32:37.206 --> 32:38.821
Aim at the Hynerian.

32:38.916 --> 32:40.622
( screeches )

32:40.709 --> 32:41.835
What?

32:43.129 --> 32:45.290
Well, pull the trigger.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.839
Kill the Peacekeeper.

32:48.926 --> 32:51.133
I'll trust you,

32:51.220 --> 32:54.257
and we'll both be happy.

32:58.352 --> 33:00.138
( moans softly )

33:00.229 --> 33:01.309
Pull the trigger.

33:01.397 --> 33:02.933
( screeching )

33:08.195 --> 33:11.813
Kill him now, or We kills you.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.323
( squawks )

33:21.458 --> 33:22.368
Pull the trigger!

33:22.459 --> 33:26.168
(howling)

33:26.255 --> 33:28.291
I'm waiting.

33:34.388 --> 33:36.925
I told you before.

33:37.016 --> 33:39.598
If I kill him, D'Argo dies.

33:39.685 --> 33:43.803
If D'Argo dies, no one
can fly the ship.

33:43.898 --> 33:48.392
If no one can fly the ship,
you don't go anywhere.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.818
Pull the trigger!

33:56.577 --> 34:00.946
You want me to kill someone
so you'll trust me?

34:01.040 --> 34:04.282
How about...

34:08.422 --> 34:09.923
Dominar...

34:10.007 --> 34:11.497
Butcher.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.962
You said this one was
more valuable.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.469
That was a microt ago.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.475
All right.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.682
(growling)

34:31.362 --> 34:32.852
( screeching )

34:34.198 --> 34:35.734
(chattering )

34:38.285 --> 34:40.526
Right. We're outta here.

34:40.621 --> 34:42.577
Oh, why notjust kill everyone?

34:42.665 --> 34:44.155
Everyone.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.582
(whispering ):
There's a knife under
the Leearvink.

34:54.343 --> 34:56.174
You okay?

34:56.262 --> 34:57.547
Fine.

34:58.639 --> 35:00.800
Listen, Crais and I can
wrap it up from here.

35:00.891 --> 35:02.847
I can finish the job.

35:02.935 --> 35:03.924
I know.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.135
But if you want to go
back to Moya...

35:06.230 --> 35:07.936
Idont

35:13.487 --> 35:15.102
But thank you.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.313
Are you ready?

35:18.701 --> 35:19.816
Yeah.

35:19.910 --> 35:21.286
Crais?

35:22.705 --> 35:24.320
We're ready now.

35:24.415 --> 35:26.451
( beeping )
Yes, Talyn.

35:28.877 --> 35:32.165
I promise you that I will
do everything I can

35:32.256 --> 35:36.169
and Crichton and Aeryn
will as well.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.376
We're all here with you.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.257
You have not disappointed me.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.091
I don't hold you responsible.

35:46.895 --> 35:48.226
Neither does Moya.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.430
( beeps and whirs)

35:50.524 --> 35:52.355
Oh, no, no.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.026
On the contrary, Talyn.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.072
You are very brave.

36:00.159 --> 36:02.400
( soft beeps )

36:05.831 --> 36:07.867
As you wish.

36:24.892 --> 36:27.850
( powering down )

36:38.447 --> 36:41.610
(rumbling)

36:46.288 --> 36:51.282
( chanting softly)

36:54.296 --> 36:56.378
He's gone.

37:20.656 --> 37:21.896
( screeching )

37:21.990 --> 37:24.242
Get him up.
-I'm trying to keep him awake.

37:24.326 --> 37:26.817
If you want me to pilot that
ship for you, he must
remain conscious.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.777
( screeching )

37:28.872 --> 37:29.907
Waitress.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.454
Waitress!

37:34.920 --> 37:38.788
Time to join your
cook boyfriend.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.463
Rygel:
No.

37:40.551 --> 37:44.294
I'll get you all the currency
you could ever want.

37:45.180 --> 37:47.341
Leave her alone.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.445
(snons)

38:00.529 --> 38:02.394
( screeching )

38:03.532 --> 38:07.946
Go back in the kitchen.
Don't come out again.

38:13.584 --> 38:15.825
( screeching )

38:15.919 --> 38:17.329
Where are you going?

38:17.421 --> 38:18.251
(chuckling)

38:18.338 --> 38:21.205
Need a kill souvenir.
Want to help?

38:21.300 --> 38:23.291
Ah, sick toad.

38:23.385 --> 38:25.125
(snickering )

38:25.220 --> 38:26.300
We have to go.

38:26.388 --> 38:27.924
Just give me a microt.

38:28.015 --> 38:29.300
(snons)

38:34.313 --> 38:40.525
Sorry I had to shoot you,
but you know how it goes.

38:40.611 --> 38:43.102
How did you know I was
wearing body armor?

38:43.197 --> 38:44.528
(mirthless chuckle)

38:44.615 --> 38:46.321
I wasn't sure, but...

38:46.408 --> 38:53.280
131 cycles in Peacekeeper
captivity teaches you
a few things.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.284
And what if you were wrong?

38:55.375 --> 38:59.209
Well, not so bad for me
either way.

38:59.296 --> 39:00.832
( chuckling softly)

39:01.673 --> 39:03.629
Plan?

39:03.717 --> 39:06.925
We can't leave with them,
or we're all dead.

39:07.804 --> 39:10.056
There's a knife under
the plate.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.301
It's on the floor in front
of the counter.

39:12.392 --> 39:15.259
( screeching )
Hynerian!

39:15.354 --> 39:16.810
Almost done.

39:16.897 --> 39:19.889
( laughing )
His ears are tougher
than I thought.

39:19.983 --> 39:21.939
(screeching and hooting )

39:23.487 --> 39:26.229
You got anything to contribute?

39:30.911 --> 39:32.572
(gasping)

39:32.663 --> 39:34.494
The silver one. Hurry.

39:40.629 --> 39:43.587
Single pulse charge.
You've only got one.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.334
Good luck.

39:45.425 --> 39:46.756
Be there.

39:46.843 --> 39:50.301
(screeching and yelling)
Hynerian!

39:53.433 --> 39:55.424
Get off. Get over there!

40:01.316 --> 40:02.817
(clearing throat)

40:02.901 --> 40:04.357
I've changed my mind.

40:04.444 --> 40:05.274
What?! What?!

40:05.362 --> 40:07.148
I'm not going with you.

40:07.239 --> 40:08.820
You can kill those two
if you like.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.022
Why, you dirty little...

40:10.117 --> 40:11.197
Ah!

40:11.285 --> 40:12.946
What's this about?

40:13.036 --> 40:14.151
Regrets.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.862
I'd rather be dead than deal
with the likes of you.

40:16.957 --> 40:18.822
(howling)

40:20.294 --> 40:23.832
Oh, why so difficult?!

40:23.922 --> 40:26.789
Because you didn't think it
through, fekkik.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.544
You didn't have a plan.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.967
What's that? What's that there?
What's that you've got?!

40:31.054 --> 40:32.794
My leg!

40:33.765 --> 40:35.301
Get it off my leg!

40:35.392 --> 40:36.928
(screeching and yelling)

40:38.228 --> 40:40.184
Kill them all!

40:40.272 --> 40:42.388
( screeching )

40:43.483 --> 40:45.940
(screeching, yelling,
and gunfire)

41:14.890 --> 41:16.926
(grunting)

41:17.017 --> 41:18.723
( hooting )

41:24.733 --> 41:26.098
D'Argo...

41:26.652 --> 41:28.267
(grunting)

41:28.362 --> 41:30.398
D'Argo.

41:30.489 --> 41:31.820
( panting ):
What?

41:31.907 --> 41:34.489
Are you all right?

41:34.576 --> 41:36.112
Ah, I'm fine.

41:36.203 --> 41:38.694
I've got a, uh...

41:38.789 --> 41:40.780
I've got a hard skull.

41:40.874 --> 41:43.206
Ijust think I'll, uh...
(chuckling)

41:44.127 --> 41:45.958
( howling softly)

41:48.340 --> 41:50.331
(growling)

41:50.967 --> 41:51.956
(clearing throat)

41:52.052 --> 41:54.634
Now, about our deal.

41:58.558 --> 42:00.344
Yes.

42:00.435 --> 42:02.551
I believe perhaps...

42:02.646 --> 42:05.979
there is a basis for us to
trust one another.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.690
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

42:09.778 --> 42:11.643
(chuckling)

42:44.146 --> 42:45.727
Chiana:
Ah! So, you're all right?

42:45.814 --> 42:47.350
D'Argo:
As well as can be expected.

42:47.441 --> 42:48.806
( laughing )

42:48.900 --> 42:52.017
D'Argo's hurt his leg, his
head, and burnt his hand.

42:52.112 --> 42:53.522
But he'll survive.

42:53.613 --> 42:55.945
What happened to you guys?
Why didn't you call in?

42:56.032 --> 42:58.318
Well, the restaurant, it, uh...

42:58.410 --> 43:00.492
it sort of burned down.
I don't want to talk about it.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.945
It's a long story.
Anything happen here on Moya?

43:03.039 --> 43:05.416
Chiana:
Oh, yeah. Just the usual.

43:05.500 --> 43:07.161
Rygel, do we have a deal?

43:07.252 --> 43:08.992
Oh, very much.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.999
I'm proud to say I've secured
everything we wanted,

43:12.090 --> 43:16.003
including acceptable
security precautions.

43:16.094 --> 43:17.550
(chuckling)

43:20.307 --> 43:22.298
I have a bad feeling.

43:23.268 --> 43:25.350
About the Command Carrier.

43:26.313 --> 43:27.723
Do you think we shouldn't go?

43:27.814 --> 43:29.099
I don't think we have a choice.

43:29.191 --> 43:33.230
If Scorpius masters
wormholes then...

43:34.529 --> 43:39.364
Yeah, some things you die for.

43:46.374 --> 43:50.993
| just can't watch that
happen again.

43:52.214 --> 43:56.173
It was perfect.
We were so... perfect

43:56.259 --> 43:58.466
and you're just like him.
I mean, you are him.

43:58.553 --> 44:00.134
No.

44:01.181 --> 44:03.263
I'm me.

44:03.350 --> 44:05.215
I was here.

44:10.273 --> 44:12.935
I missed that dance.

44:16.404 --> 44:18.019
Aeryn.

44:21.368 --> 44:23.108
Don't come with us.

44:27.582 --> 44:30.745
No, we started this together,
Crichton.

44:36.132 --> 44:38.259
That's how we'll end it.
