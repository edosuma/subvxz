<i>Crossbow, this is Watchdog.
Confirm transmissions.</i>

02:19.520 --> 02:25.038
<i>Roger, Watchdog. Crossbow is on
Discriminator, and all systems are go.</i>

02:27.320 --> 02:31.438
<i>Roger, we mark you go
for maneuvering sequence.</i>

02:33.520 --> 02:37.354
Watchdog, this is Crossbow.
Confirm we are go for arm.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.033
<i>Affirmative, Crossbow.</i>

02:39.280 --> 02:44.274
<i>Select electrics to max, vents
to open, and systems to onboard.</i>

02:44.520 --> 02:46.875
<i>- Roger. Crossbow is armed.
- Roger.</i>

02:47.080 --> 02:49.719
<i>We have confirmation.
Rabbit in the hole.</i>

02:49.960 --> 02:53.032
Moving Target Indicator, engaged.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.119
<i>- Pathfinder on. I'm going on the scope.
- Roger.</i>

02:59.520 --> 03:00.748
<i>Scanner on.</i>

03:01.240 --> 03:03.834
Target locked.
Tracking locked.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.197
<i>- Roger.
- Easy does it. That's it.</i>

03:07.440 --> 03:09.351
Hold it right there.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.590
<i>The Crossbow Project.</i>

03:24.800 --> 03:28.952
<i>- There's no defence like a good offense.
- Mission accomplished.</i>

03:30.320 --> 03:34.871
<i>- Outstanding, Crossbow.
- Just like shooting ducks in a barrel.</i>

03:35.120 --> 03:38.635
<i>Our scientists are
turning an engineering dream...</i>

03:38.880 --> 03:43.476
<i>...into an effective reality.
- All we have to do is build it.</i>

03:43.720 --> 03:47.315
- Nice weapon, isn't it?
- What did you think, Roy?

03:47.560 --> 03:50.438
I think there weren't
enough girls in it.

03:50.720 --> 03:54.508
I have a tape on alternate uses,
mini-shuttle plans...

03:54.720 --> 03:57.553
...and B-1 modifications
for aerial launch.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.593
Does any responsible agency
know about this?

04:00.800 --> 04:03.997
It's a need-to-know basis.
The CIA's responsible.

04:04.240 --> 04:08.233
They do need to know.
You're gonna cause an escalation.

04:08.480 --> 04:12.678
Our studies indicate
this weapon is useless in warfare.

04:12.920 --> 04:17.994
It's not for war. It's a peacetime
weapon. That's why it's secret.

04:18.240 --> 04:22.119
- So it's both immoral and unethical?
- Yes.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.396
When do we get it?

04:24.640 --> 04:28.872
There is a tiny technical
problem with the energy source...

04:29.120 --> 04:33.318
I don't want problems.
We have plans for it this summer.

04:34.120 --> 04:38.432
I need a success. I don't need
any delays jeopardizing that.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.672
- Am I making myself clear?
- Clear as vodka.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.673
Tell Dr. Hathaway to get on the stick.

04:44.920 --> 04:49.755
- I'm gonna have to push harder.
- As long as we have a weapon by June.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.638
- Right?
- I wouldn't know.

04:51.880 --> 04:54.838
I haven't had
a working weapon since Korea.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.309
I'm sorry, this is too much.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.951
- I'm gonna ask for a reassignment.
- I'm sorry to hear that, George.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.348
I urge you to stop.

05:09.600 --> 05:13.115
Thanks for your input.
Sorry you won't be on the team.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.276
Maybe next time.

05:15.520 --> 05:19.035
Too bad. Used to be a good man.

05:19.240 --> 05:22.437
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to liberate George.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.279
Liberate? You mean, liquidate?

05:30.520 --> 05:35.640
Let's see that film on blinding
techniques. Then we'll have lunch.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.838
- Could you sign this?
- Are you Doctor Hathaway?

05:57.040 --> 06:03.434
- I just loved your television show.
- Thank you. That's very kind of you.

06:03.880 --> 06:09.398
- What is Mr. Einstein really like?
- Dead.

06:09.680 --> 06:14.834
Dad, laser means light amplification
by stimulated emissions of radiation.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.275
So this is coherent light.

06:17.520 --> 06:20.796
- Oh, so it talks, right?
- No.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.878
- Dr. Hathaway, what a surprise!
- How are you?

06:24.120 --> 06:28.716
Is something wrong with the test
scores? If there is, it's because...

06:28.920 --> 06:31.832
I thought I'd bring
you the news myself.

06:32.040 --> 06:36.477
I got word from admissions.
Mitch is in at Pacific Tech.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.278
- Wonderful!
- Way to go!

06:38.520 --> 06:40.078
Don't shake his head!

06:40.320 --> 06:41.878
- How you doing?
- Fine.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.270
- Nice display here.
- Thanks.

06:44.520 --> 06:48.274
It's a flash lamp
ultraviolet laser at 342 nanometres.

06:48.520 --> 06:53.036
As you know, there is interest
in the iodine laser for fusion.

06:53.240 --> 06:58.394
This is molecular iodine. This laser
doesn't suffer from recombination.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.439
You must be proud.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.874
- Proud?
- Sure.

07:02.080 --> 07:05.755
He's the first student we've
accepted for winter term.

07:06.920 --> 07:10.913
- I bet he's the youngest too.
- The youngest was 12.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.236
He cracked under the pressure...

07:13.480 --> 07:16.438
He's 15. There won't be any problem.

07:16.640 --> 07:21.395
Listen, about the scholarship.
You're gonna give him a bonus, right?

07:21.600 --> 07:25.434
No. But by allowing Mitch to progress
at a quicker rate...

07:25.680 --> 07:30.117
...we give him the chance to fill
a greater portion of his potential.

07:30.320 --> 07:35.440
We want the best for Mitchie. I saw
your show on radioactive isotopes.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.069
- And I've got a question.
- Yes?

07:38.320 --> 07:40.709
- Is that your real hair?
- Yeah?

07:41.280 --> 07:44.033
- Tell me, is Mitch adopted?
- Why, no!

07:44.280 --> 07:46.032
- It's amazing.
- Isn't it?

07:46.240 --> 07:48.390
I need something to eat. Come on.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.632
- Bye, Dr. Hathaway.
- Goodbye.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.515
See you later, honey.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.838
They're okay. Sometimes they
don't know what I'm talking about.

08:00.080 --> 08:04.471
I'm sure about that. Tell me,
are you gonna miss your friends?

08:04.720 --> 08:08.110
- No, I think I intimidate other kids.
- Good boy.

08:08.720 --> 08:14.078
Understand, compared to you, most
people have the IQ of a carrot.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.471
We're different from most people.
Better. I'm...

08:17.720 --> 08:21.679
- There you are, doctor!
- Hi. Yes, one second.

08:21.920 --> 08:26.630
I've put you on my research team
with the best minds. This is only...

08:26.880 --> 08:31.635
...the second time for a freshman.
- The first was Chris Knight, right?

08:31.840 --> 08:34.751
- You've heard of him?
- He's a physics legend.

08:34.960 --> 08:40.193
You'll be working with him. He's
a senior now, as brilliant as ever.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.431
Wow!

08:43.919 --> 08:47.276
- This job will be waiting, Chris.
- Great.

08:47.520 --> 08:51.035
- We have a physical plant here.
- You have a Jacuzzi?

08:51.240 --> 08:52.673
- Absolutely.
- Good.

08:52.920 --> 08:57.436
And the labs and offices are
over this way. Follow me, please.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.436
Guys!

09:08.720 --> 09:12.679
- Meet Chris Knight. This is Sherry.
- Pleased to meet you.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.480
- This is Mike Dodd.
- Dr. Dodd?

09:15.720 --> 09:20.236
- He designed our new Telcom satellite.
- It's an honour to meet you.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.072
Telcom.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.437
The satellite raining debris
all over Europe?

09:25.640 --> 09:27.358
Why is that on your head?

09:27.600 --> 09:30.433
If I wear it anywhere else,
it chafes.

09:30.640 --> 09:34.269
I'm sorry. I didn't want you
to think I was stuffy.

09:34.520 --> 09:38.433
You know, no fun.
All brain, no penis.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.677
- Pardon me?
- I'm sorry.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.480
It's an infantile response
to authority.

09:43.720 --> 09:47.793
- You are Chris Knight?
- I hope so. I'm wearing his underwear.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.878
It's a joke! I get it!
Funny!

09:51.120 --> 09:53.270
I can't help it.
You're such fun.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.478
We try to be.
Isn't that right, Mike?

09:56.720 --> 09:58.438
No.

09:58.640 --> 10:04.476
Sherry's gonna show you around. Ask
questions about benefits, dress codes.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.473
- I'll see you in my office later.
- Great.

10:07.720 --> 10:12.635
Take care of him. He's one of the ten
finest minds in the country!

10:12.840 --> 10:15.434
Someday I hope to be two of them.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.831
- You are beautiful.
- Thanks.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.473
Did I come off stuffy?

10:21.720 --> 10:24.678
You don't act like
one of the top ten minds.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.275
- How many have you met?
- Seven.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.715
- Really?
- You'll be eight.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.678
Professor Hostetler was number six.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.992
Old Professor Hostetler?
Isn't he dead?

10:38.520 --> 10:40.590
He is now.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.473
Hello. I'm looking
for the Freshman Tea?

10:49.720 --> 10:53.110
Oh, good. I'm so glad
we have one then.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.837
- I don't think so.
- Gene.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.874
- This is Mitch Taylor.
- Hathaway's bright star.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.953
- Yes, sir.
- You're already on his project.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.476
- We expect great things from you.
- I hope so.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.156
- A bit of advice.
- Oh, thank you.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.670
Always...

11:13.920 --> 11:17.230
Never forget to check
your references.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.871
Okay. Thank you.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.475
I better be going. Sorry.

11:26.880 --> 11:31.078
The young people enjoy it
when I "get down" verbally.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.835
Where's the funeral?

11:45.320 --> 11:48.039
How you doing, sport?

11:50.520 --> 11:53.239
Hey, Bobby, wait up, man!

11:55.280 --> 11:58.829
See if he's in his room.
He might be in there.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.238
Hello?

12:43.480 --> 12:46.199
- What kind of place is this?
- Hi.

12:46.440 --> 12:50.228
Would you be prepared
if gravity reversed itself?

12:51.320 --> 12:54.835
I can't figure out how
to keep change in my pocket.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.753
I've got it! Nudity!

12:58.920 --> 13:00.478
I was here earlier...

13:00.720 --> 13:02.676
- You didn't straighten up?
- No.

13:02.920 --> 13:07.869
Good. All my filth is in alphabetical
order. This was under "H" for toy.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.235
What is that?

13:09.440 --> 13:11.476
It's a penis stretcher.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.948
- Wanna try it?
- No!

13:13.280 --> 13:19.594
I'm kidding. It's another diversion
in an attempt to avoid responsibility.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.229
I left my bags. Now they're empty.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.838
You see, Mitch, I used to be you.

13:29.320 --> 13:34.314
I've been missing me, so I asked
if I could room with me again.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.393
I put your stuff in the bottom drawer.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.996
I threw out the sports jacket.
Duck!

13:42.080 --> 13:45.436
Nice reflexes. I'm Chris Knight.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.676
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes. Duck again!

13:51.800 --> 13:56.635
Oh, my God! It's heading
for the gas tanks. Duck!

13:58.920 --> 14:02.549
Was that a launch problem
or a design problem?

14:04.120 --> 14:07.510
- We're falling behind.
- We're not making sandwiches.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.031
Get down!

14:10.360 --> 14:13.238
Are you crazy?
You could have killed us!

14:13.480 --> 14:15.835
I cannot be seen with you.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.430
But since I'm driving,
shouldn't you be hiding?

14:19.640 --> 14:21.710
He saw me.

14:22.120 --> 14:27.513
The climate has changed. We need a
working model in four months, not 18.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.832
You can't dictate innovation, Don.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.752
I'll put it another way.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.236
- You know the money for development?
- Yes.

14:36.480 --> 14:41.634
When a project gets cut off, the
finance boys always run an audit.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.831
I see.

14:45.680 --> 14:51.437
Having a little work done on
the old place, Jer? Fraud is a felony.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.639
What are you looking at?
You're labourers!

14:59.840 --> 15:03.071
That's what you get
for not having an education.

15:03.320 --> 15:07.836
Get out of here!
Go on! Get out!

15:09.320 --> 15:10.469
- Got it!
- Yeah!

15:23.160 --> 15:24.434
Are you two...?

15:24.680 --> 15:25.715
- Hey!
- Yes?

15:25.920 --> 15:28.309
- Put down the sandwiches and go.
- Me?

15:28.520 --> 15:30.909
- No, Yoda. Yeah, you!
- Just a bit.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.872
- I don't have any...
- Brains?

15:33.120 --> 15:35.475
- No. Sandwiches.
- What good are you?

15:35.720 --> 15:39.110
- What will we eat?
- Are you from the restaurant?

15:39.360 --> 15:45.230
No! I'm Mitch Taylor. I'm a student.
Dr. Hathaway told me to come up here.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.957
So you're the new stud, are you?

15:50.640 --> 15:53.473
- How do you mean?
- Stud. Hotshot. Brain.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.429
- You're 12, right?
- I'm 15. Are you expecting him...?

15:57.640 --> 15:59.915
Yeah. Can I get you something?

16:00.160 --> 16:04.676
- A balloon?
- I'm supposed to check over your work.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.639
- Check it over?
- Well, yes.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.876
- For what?
- Mistakes, I guess.

16:10.120 --> 16:15.399
- He said you guys were stuck.
- No! Let's get something clear here.

16:15.640 --> 16:19.076
Okay, when Jerry's not here,
you do what I say.

16:19.320 --> 16:24.075
It goes from God to Jerry to me.
Get it?

16:26.320 --> 16:27.355
Hello, Jerry.

16:27.680 --> 16:31.559
- You don't get to use my first name.
- Did I?

16:31.880 --> 16:35.839
How you doing, Mitch?
I'm sure you'll all be friends.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.832
- We're on our way.
- Good.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.277
I want you to take
your cues from Mitch.

16:41.520 --> 16:45.069
His ideas are
the most original I've seen.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.995
- So Mitch is in charge of the group.
- Really, Jerry?

16:49.240 --> 16:51.708
- You're doing it again.
- Oh, am I?

16:51.960 --> 16:57.034
- Where is Knight?
- He didn't bother to come in today.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.674
- Yes?
- He said he didn't feel like it.

16:59.920 --> 17:04.435
I said, "You better or you'll be
in trouble." He said, "Jam it!"

17:04.680 --> 17:08.832
- Great. You're not stuttering.
- I give myself shock treatments.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.268
Up the voltage.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.876
- I'm sorry he's not here...
- That clown? Look!

17:14.119 --> 17:16.714
Kent decided to start without him.

17:16.920 --> 17:20.595
The yield's insignificant.
We think the sample's damaged.

17:20.920 --> 17:24.276
- What?
- Obviously the result of negligence.

17:24.520 --> 17:28.877
It'll take a week to prepare a new
sample. I was afraid of this.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.554
- Are you sure?
- We're sure. Positive.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.678
- Excuse me.
- There is no excuse for it.

17:34.920 --> 17:39.072
- Yeah, Mitch, what is it?
- The pump laser is down.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.038
Look.

17:45.480 --> 17:46.674
There.

17:46.920 --> 17:50.117
Well, it seems to be all better now.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.079
Don't touch other people's things!

17:53.320 --> 17:56.630
- Kent, I need you.
- Anything, Jerry.

17:56.880 --> 18:00.475
What? Do you want me to teach
your class for you?

18:00.720 --> 18:04.633
No, I need you to get copies
of all the data so far.

18:04.840 --> 18:08.037
So Mitch can check
everything tomorrow.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.676
- My pleasure.
- After that, stop by my cleaners.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.831
Don't give it a thought.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.271
- Mitch, shall we? On the moment.
- Sure.

18:22.440 --> 18:27.389
Well, I guess it goes from God
to Jerry to you...

18:27.640 --> 18:29.835
...to the cleaners.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.435
Right, Kent?

18:34.240 --> 18:39.439
Library. Library... 205.

18:49.080 --> 18:53.517
Welcome to Pacific Tech's
"Smart People on Ice."

18:55.440 --> 18:58.671
Let's go skating.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.354
Ick, the ice turned out great!

19:01.600 --> 19:04.637
Yeah, it worked, didn't it?

19:04.880 --> 19:06.632
- How did you do it?
- Sure.

19:06.880 --> 19:12.637
I tell you, you tell somebody else,
next we're in another ice age.

19:13.720 --> 19:17.076
- Everybody must be skating.
- You're a slack!

19:17.320 --> 19:19.436
- Moles and trolls.
- What?

19:19.680 --> 19:22.911
Moles and trolls. Work.
We never see daylight.

19:23.160 --> 19:27.119
We plan for weeks and all
they do is study. I'm disgusted.

19:27.320 --> 19:31.154
I'm sorry, but it's not like me.
I'm depressed.

19:31.400 --> 19:35.678
We had one entry for the Madame Curie
look-alike contest...

19:35.920 --> 19:40.675
...and he was disqualified later.
Why do I bother?

19:40.920 --> 19:43.992
Let's go! What are you,
a bunch of weirdos?

19:44.240 --> 19:48.438
- Want a cherry? I grow them myself.
- What?

19:49.120 --> 19:51.839
Okay, push once.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.389
Are you okay?

19:59.480 --> 20:03.075
No, not emotionally.
I'm disappointed. Not terribly.

20:03.280 --> 20:05.714
It should have gone further, faster.

20:05.960 --> 20:09.236
The problem is obviously
the drag coefficient.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.870
I'll have to redesign the blades.
I can do that.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.192
But I've got to cut them,
and that takes time.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.472
- How long will this last?
- Maybe a half an hour.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.631
That's great. I can do that.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.030
- Okay. What's your name?
- Mitch.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.669
Thanks for your help.
See you later.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.478
You're welcome!

20:28.720 --> 20:30.199
- Who was that?
- That...

20:30.400 --> 20:34.439
I'm Jordan. I heard there was
someone new. Are you it?

20:34.680 --> 20:35.749
Yes.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.592
- Do you have a bed?
- Yeah.

20:37.800 --> 20:42.032
I'd make you one, but you have one.
Okay, see you later. Bye.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.037
Bye.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.518
- What's all this?
- This? This is ice.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.439
This is what happens
when water gets cold.

20:52.640 --> 20:57.839
This is Kent. This is what happens
when people get sexually frustrated.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.672
This should keep you busy.

21:00.920 --> 21:04.515
This with your classes should
turn your brain to mush.

21:04.760 --> 21:08.833
That's unfair. And we were gonna
make you carnival king.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.116
Yeah?

21:11.360 --> 21:14.636
Ha, ha. You're in on this too.
Did you make it?

21:14.840 --> 21:17.115
- I'm not saying.
- Who'll clean it?

21:17.360 --> 21:21.433
You don't have to.
It's gonna go directly to gas.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.039
Really? What is it?

21:23.320 --> 21:26.676
All I can tell you is
it's rare and unstable.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.638
Just like you.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.717
- You're degenerates.
- We are?

21:30.960 --> 21:33.872
- I found you naked with Jell-O!
- You did not!

21:34.080 --> 21:35.229
This is true.

21:35.480 --> 21:38.472
I was hot, and I was hungry. Okay?

21:39.040 --> 21:41.110
I got news for you, Knight.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.079
- You're not first anymore.
- First what?

21:44.320 --> 21:48.233
- Mitch beat your scores by 20 points.
- Yeah, you did?

21:48.440 --> 21:52.069
- You think you're hot stuff, huh?
- No.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.470
Maybe you are smarter than me.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.234
But can you do this?

22:04.720 --> 22:08.633
- Ick, what's happening with the ice?
- Open a window!

22:10.080 --> 22:12.958
Ick, I'm melting!

22:13.320 --> 22:14.878
- It worked!
- Neat!

22:15.120 --> 22:20.035
- Now if we can keep it from exploding.
- Exploding? Oh, God.

22:20.840 --> 22:25.868
Hey, Ick. You're just joking
about exploding, right?

22:26.120 --> 22:29.590
Ick? It's a joke, right?

23:33.320 --> 23:38.030
Good morning. I saw you come in.
We met last night? I'm Jordan.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.714
- I made you a sweater.
- Last night?

23:40.960 --> 23:43.872
It's something I do.
Hope the size is right.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.395
I used my brother
as a comparison.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.076
I went ahead and made you one,
because I was up.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.675
- Are you peeing?
- Yeah.

23:52.920 --> 23:56.117
I never sleep.
I drove my roommate nuts.

23:56.320 --> 24:01.314
She's okay, but she had to transfer.
I don't know if that's my fault.

24:01.560 --> 24:06.839
If you ever need to talk, let me know,
because I never sleep, okay?

24:07.080 --> 24:08.752
- I will.
- Are you done?

24:09.520 --> 24:11.829
- I can't start.
- Because I'm here?

24:12.080 --> 24:13.877
I think so.

24:14.120 --> 24:18.033
- Weird. Well, I have to go.
- Me too.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.236
Bye.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.434
Good morning!

24:39.160 --> 24:41.276
- Chris?
- Morning.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.756
You know, something strange
happened this morning.

24:44.960 --> 24:49.476
Was it a dream where you're standing
in a robe on a pyramid...

24:49.720 --> 24:53.872
...with 1000 naked women screaming
and throwing pickles at you?

24:54.120 --> 24:55.269
No.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.830
Why am I the only person
that has that dream?

25:03.080 --> 25:05.640
Is that liquid nitrogen?

25:06.160 --> 25:08.151
- Coffee?
- No.

25:13.920 --> 25:17.151
- What happened?
- There's a guy in our closet.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.196
You've seen him too?

25:20.480 --> 25:21.993
Who is he?

25:25.560 --> 25:26.549
Hollyfeld.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.314
- Why does he go in?
- Why do you go in?

25:29.520 --> 25:32.478
To get my clothes.
But that's not why he does.

25:32.720 --> 25:36.315
Of course not.
Your clothes would never fit him.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.631
Yeah.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.071
Think before you ask.

25:41.320 --> 25:46.030
Twenty points higher and thinks
a guy like that can wear his clothes.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.512
<i>plus y, equals zero.</i>

29:51.720 --> 29:53.631
This is it!

31:43.520 --> 31:45.909
Come on, get out of here! Get!

31:46.320 --> 31:48.834
- You wanted to see me?
- Mr. Knight.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.838
Right on time.
Unusual these days.

31:52.040 --> 31:55.237
- You still run?
- Only when chased.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.875
- What smells?
- Must be the dog.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.712
- That's popcorn.
- I know.

31:59.920 --> 32:04.072
Get it away from me. I hate popcorn.
Put it over there.

32:04.320 --> 32:07.437
Now I know what to get you
for your birthday.

32:08.120 --> 32:11.430
I guess we're moving up
in the world, eh?

32:11.680 --> 32:14.433
- Very elegant.
- Try not to touch anything.

32:14.640 --> 32:18.235
- Is this okay, sir?
- It's oak, it's not plywood.

32:18.440 --> 32:21.830
- Quite a change from the old place.
- Shoes.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.474
I want to see
more of you in the lab.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.233
Fine. I'll gain weight.

32:26.440 --> 32:30.274
- You're very funny, Chris.
- Thanks, Jerry, we try.

32:32.440 --> 32:34.431
You can sit.

32:34.720 --> 32:38.633
When I brought you here,
I thought you'd be an Einstein.

32:38.880 --> 32:42.077
- You were on your way. Then?
- I got a haircut.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.914
- You're disappointing me.
- And you me.

32:45.160 --> 32:49.039
- Look, it's about our deal.
- I know, Jerry.

32:49.280 --> 32:52.192
I've advanced your project
more than anyone.

32:52.440 --> 32:55.352
Yesterday. What have you done
for me today?

32:56.520 --> 32:59.034
Well, uh...

33:00.120 --> 33:03.430
I want five megawatts by mid-May.

33:04.720 --> 33:11.114
I think you might be getting obsessive
about all this. I took in Mitch, okay?

33:11.520 --> 33:15.069
He's coming along fine.
He's working his guts out.

33:15.320 --> 33:19.108
- So, what do you want?
- I want five megawatts by mid-May.

33:19.320 --> 33:24.030
Look, I don't care
if you're arrogant or disrespectful.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.471
But you're distracting Mitch.
That I won't have.

33:27.720 --> 33:31.633
The rules have changed.
I want it by mid-May.

33:31.880 --> 33:37.477
Jerry, I think you're forgetting
one little detail. I'm out of here.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.029
I'm gone, I'm history.
I'm Casper.

33:40.280 --> 33:44.592
- I'm graduating.
- To graduate, you need my course.

33:44.800 --> 33:48.110
I have a say about
what you do and where you go.

33:48.520 --> 33:52.069
So you and Mitch will spend
every moment in the lab.

33:52.320 --> 33:56.438
You will solve my power problem
by my deadline.

33:59.240 --> 34:04.837
If you think that threatening me
will make me your slave, you're right.

34:05.080 --> 34:08.231
But I'm only saying this
because I care.

34:08.480 --> 34:13.679
There are decaffeinated brands
that are as tasty as the real thing.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.434
I'm not kidding, Chris.

34:17.719 --> 34:20.234
Neither am I, Jerry.

34:29.639 --> 34:30.708
Hi, Mitch.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.193
Do me a favour.

34:33.400 --> 34:37.234
Taste this.
Come on, you won't hurt my feelings.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.074
What, too sweet?

34:39.840 --> 34:43.514
- What is it?
- I don't know, it was in the lab.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.358
Relax, it's just yogurt.

34:48.560 --> 34:52.792
- Mitch, are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.869
This combination of cyanide is dumb.
This is the wrong direction.

34:58.120 --> 35:03.433
Only you know how to use this garbage.
And I'm getting brain-fried.

35:03.720 --> 35:08.077
I'll make it up to you.
Let's just pause, put that down.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.796
Let's just take a step back.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.195
No, take a step forward.

35:14.440 --> 35:19.036
Now, take a step back.
And a step forward. Then step back.

35:19.640 --> 35:23.349
- Will you stop? I'm serious.
- Okay, I'm serious too.

35:23.560 --> 35:26.836
Let's charge it up.
Give me everything you got.

35:27.080 --> 35:32.359
- I gotta connect the capacitors.
- Okay, this is work time.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.996
- How you doing?
- Fine. Don't rush me.

35:43.240 --> 35:47.392
Okay, just take your time.
Everything's fine.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.674
What is taking so long?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.389
I'm coming.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.074
Charging.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.993
Shades.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.389
- What are you doing?
- Waiting.

36:10.400 --> 36:14.234
It's just the fuse.
It'll be back on in a minute.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.995
I shouldn't have used
the building transformer.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.988
But, more importantly,
did we get a charge?

36:24.040 --> 36:25.234
What'd you do?

36:25.720 --> 36:27.472
- Wait!
- Come on, Sputnik.

36:27.680 --> 36:30.558
You wanted help,
so here we go.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.078
- Beautiful minds.
- We have work.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.788
We're going to work.
Hard work.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.195
This must've taken hours.

36:39.400 --> 36:40.719
Let's find out.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.919
I told you they'd come back on.

36:48.160 --> 36:51.391
- What's this?
- It's a laser beam, bozo.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.598
- What's it for?
- Not what. Where.

36:54.800 --> 36:58.588
- What?
- Follow it. It's a surprise.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.511
Like it?

37:04.280 --> 37:07.272
Hey, what's the beam splitter for?

37:08.200 --> 37:12.671
What's the matter?
Need everything spelled out for you?

37:16.320 --> 37:18.390
Come on, let's tan!

37:20.880 --> 37:22.279
One for Mitch.

37:34.080 --> 37:37.231
Come on in,
the South Pacific calls you.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.513
- Who're the girls?
- Not from around here.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.908
- They're from a nearby college.
- Where?

37:45.160 --> 37:47.549
The Wanda Trossler Beauty School.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.435
- They're beauticians?
- Not yet.

37:50.640 --> 37:54.519
- I don't know.
- Your genius might impress them.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.631
I don't see how.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.630
Given the type of guys you are...

37:59.880 --> 38:05.637
...this may be your only chance
in your entire lives...

38:05.880 --> 38:07.836
...to have sex.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.110
Think about it.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.748
Destiny!
I've got her now.

38:46.200 --> 38:50.637
Don't you know that eating that
can give you large breasts?

38:50.880 --> 38:53.394
Oh, my God.
I'm too late.

39:05.960 --> 39:09.032
Don't think I don't
want my invention to work.

39:09.280 --> 39:13.273
- The day's only so long.
- Ready to go.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.717
Pushing me doesn't help.
Tell them that.

39:16.960 --> 39:21.033
Start showing results
or they'll find somebody else.

39:21.280 --> 39:24.431
- Oh, really?
- You won't have your big toys.

39:24.640 --> 39:28.269
I'm the best.
Do you know who you're dealing with?

39:28.840 --> 39:31.593
How dare you try this.
I have to go on.

39:31.800 --> 39:35.236
This conversation is in
incredibly poor taste.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.153
- Son of a bitch.
- Asshole.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.629
<i>Welcome to Everything,
with Jerome Hathaway.</i>

39:44.880 --> 39:49.635
<i>Funded by a grant from
Darlington E lectronic Instruments.</i>

39:49.840 --> 39:53.628
<i>Hi, I'm Jerry Hathaway,
with Everything.</i>

39:53.880 --> 39:59.716
Tonight, we'll look at something
that most of us take for granted.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.869
The colon.
What does it look like?

40:04.680 --> 40:05.908
Get out of there.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.791
- Kent!
- Cut!

40:09.000 --> 40:13.471
- You're in front of the teleprompter.
- Well, I didn't know.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.833
- We need to talk.
- Get my laundry?

40:17.080 --> 40:19.594
- Yes, but there's more.
- The gravy.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.913
No, that came out.
Chris and Mitch, they're at a party.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.111
With girls.

40:27.880 --> 40:30.872
- I want you to show me.
- My pleasure.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.875
- Hi, are you busy?
- Yes. No.

41:12.080 --> 41:15.914
Wanna help test my rebreather?
Come on!

41:16.160 --> 41:17.593
Sure!

41:23.040 --> 41:26.669
It's a simple principle.
It's basically a filter.

41:26.920 --> 41:31.198
It lets CO2 out and O2 back in,
but no bubbles.

41:32.560 --> 41:36.189
- How come you're not...?
- Necking? I'm not gay!

41:36.600 --> 41:37.874
No, partying.

41:38.680 --> 41:42.878
Because I'm 19 and I'm brilliant
and hyperkinetic.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.913
Guys are afraid.
I guess I should be upset.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.519
I think you're very nice.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.440
I think you're nice too.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.595
Do you want to try this?

42:07.560 --> 42:11.109
- It's lighter in the water.
- How about you?

42:22.880 --> 42:24.154
Taylor!

42:30.480 --> 42:33.358
- Why aren't you in the lab?
- I just...

42:33.560 --> 42:36.199
You're here to work,
not to play doctor.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.039
- I got delayed.
- Where's Knight?

42:39.280 --> 42:42.158
- You both make me sick.
- Kent!

42:44.200 --> 42:49.274
I took a chance recommending you.
I can see I made a mistake.

42:49.480 --> 42:51.948
I hope you're proud of yourself.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.956
- Dr. Hathaway?
- What?

43:00.440 --> 43:02.476
Are you wearing makeup?

43:04.360 --> 43:05.759
What?

43:36.360 --> 43:41.195
I need one more course
to complete my humanities credits.

43:53.160 --> 43:57.358
I'd like to make a collect call
to Mrs. Bill Taylor.

43:57.880 --> 44:00.394
- Come on, come on.
- Mitch Taylor.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.874
I got a great idea.

44:04.120 --> 44:05.599
- What?
- Hold it down!

44:05.800 --> 44:07.392
Mom, I...

44:11.400 --> 44:13.789
I want to come home.

44:21.320 --> 44:24.630
<i>- Are you there?
- Baby, you sound upset.</i>

44:25.040 --> 44:28.510
I don't like it here.
I wanna come home.

44:29.480 --> 44:32.153
You rented out my room?!
To who?

44:32.360 --> 44:35.238
<i>Mr. Echevarria, the plumber.</i>

44:47.480 --> 44:52.998
- Where were you last night?
- The lab, where you should've been.

44:55.840 --> 45:00.630
Jordan said that Hathaway was mad.
What exactly did he...?

45:02.640 --> 45:06.030
Let me hold that thought
and get back to you.

45:12.120 --> 45:15.396
<i>- Are you there?
- Baby, you sound upset.</i>

45:15.600 --> 45:18.797
<i>I don't like it here.
I wanna come home.</i>

45:19.000 --> 45:21.878
<i>It's not for you to like,
it's for you to do.</i>

45:22.080 --> 45:25.834
<i>- You're 15 years old.
- I wanna come home.</i>

45:26.080 --> 45:29.834
<i>- You want to live with me and Daddy?
- Yeah.</i>

45:30.440 --> 45:34.638
<i>- I'll go back to high school.
- We've rented out your room.</i>

45:35.680 --> 45:38.638
<i>- Mom, to who?
- Mr. Echevarria, the plumber.</i>

45:38.880 --> 45:42.190
<i>We can share it.
I don't wanna stay here.</i>

45:43.240 --> 45:48.553
<i>- That doesn't sound like my soldier.
- Mitch, this is your dad.</i>

45:49.960 --> 45:52.838
<i>- Hi, Dad.
- Are you crying?</i>

45:53.040 --> 45:55.429
<i>- I'm sorry.
- I hope nobody sees.</i>

45:56.680 --> 46:00.036
<i>- I'm a kid.
- You've never been just a kid.</i>

46:22.560 --> 46:26.678
If you wanna leave, go ahead.

46:27.280 --> 46:30.875
But you're gonna miss the fun.

46:31.080 --> 46:32.399
What fun?

46:32.600 --> 46:36.115
Ick's releasing a new virus
in Kent's room.

46:36.320 --> 46:40.791
- The other night I needed your help.
- I helped you relax.

46:41.040 --> 46:44.237
Being snubbed by beauticians
is not relaxing.

46:44.440 --> 46:46.795
Student beauticians.

46:47.840 --> 46:52.118
I thought this place was different.
But it's the same.

46:52.360 --> 46:55.113
In high school,
I got put in a mailbox.

46:55.320 --> 46:57.993
Teachers hated me
because I was smarter.

46:58.200 --> 47:01.795
Students hated me because
I blew the bell curve.

47:02.040 --> 47:03.632
I was just like you.

47:03.880 --> 47:07.793
I had white shirts and Hush Puppies
and a briefcase.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.911
Girls never talked to me.

47:10.160 --> 47:13.869
When I got here, for
three years I studied constantly.

47:15.160 --> 47:17.037
- You?
- Yeah.

47:17.480 --> 47:21.314
One night, sitting right here,
I had a vision.

47:21.600 --> 47:23.830
- What?
- Hollyfeld.

47:24.440 --> 47:28.319
- The guy in the closet?
- Lazlo Hollyfeld.

47:28.520 --> 47:32.399
I followed him into the closet,
down into the tunnels.

47:32.600 --> 47:36.388
There I saw the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.716
- What?
- Lazlo in his pajamas.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.800
- So?
- So I talked to him.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.439
- You did?
- Yeah.

47:44.680 --> 47:49.708
He was a stud around here in the '70s.
Smarter than us put together.

47:50.640 --> 47:52.995
What happened?
Did he crack?

47:53.240 --> 47:55.037
He cracked, severely.

47:55.280 --> 47:58.397
- Why?
- He loved his work.

47:58.800 --> 48:02.395
- What's wrong with that?
- That's all he did.

48:02.600 --> 48:05.831
He loved problems,
he loved the answers.

48:06.080 --> 48:11.074
But he thought that the answers
were the answers for everything.

48:11.560 --> 48:13.596
All science,
no philosophy.

48:13.840 --> 48:18.789
One day, someone told him
the stuff he made was killing people.

48:20.240 --> 48:23.118
So, what?
I'm gonna end up in a tunnel?

48:23.760 --> 48:25.557
- Yeah.
- What?

48:25.760 --> 48:28.672
You are,
if you keep up like this.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.990
You don't need to run away.

48:31.240 --> 48:34.437
When you're smart,
people need you.

48:34.680 --> 48:37.956
You can use your mind creatively.

48:38.560 --> 48:41.632
- I noticed you don't study hard.
- Bingo.

48:45.920 --> 48:49.708
Yeah, but if I stay,
what should I do?

48:49.960 --> 48:54.112
First, get even with Kent.
It's a moral imperative.

48:57.240 --> 48:58.559
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

49:01.360 --> 49:02.839
Now, you try it.

49:05.400 --> 49:08.472
- Now, let's unpack.
- Right.

49:28.360 --> 49:31.432
That's what makes Darlington
so sweet.

49:31.680 --> 49:35.195
- But Knight's got it locked.
- Maybe, maybe not.

49:41.240 --> 49:44.073
Come on, you guys.
He's gone.

49:52.080 --> 49:55.390
- Kent's name is on his plates.
- Like my underwear.

49:55.640 --> 49:59.189
You have license plates
in your underwear?

50:13.960 --> 50:15.473
Hey, Kent.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.238
That's your car.

50:18.480 --> 50:23.395
- You're not supposed to park on campus.
- This isn't funny.

50:23.960 --> 50:27.236
- You've gone too far.
- I had help.

50:28.520 --> 50:30.272
You, huh?

50:30.880 --> 50:35.954
Dr. Hathaway's gonna hear about this.
You'll rue the day!

50:36.160 --> 50:40.119
"Rue the day"?
Who talks like that?

50:50.840 --> 50:52.956
Wow. Hello.

50:53.640 --> 50:55.392
Hi.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.992
Jerry asked me to drop by.
What about you?

51:06.200 --> 51:09.590
- What?
- Which word didn't you understand?

51:09.840 --> 51:11.796
- You here for the meeting?
- Meeting?

51:12.040 --> 51:14.679
- I don't know.
- Okay.

51:15.480 --> 51:18.631
- Look, I'm just waiting.
- Great.

51:18.960 --> 51:22.430
If you can't do it,
we'll get somebody else.

51:22.680 --> 51:27.071
- I have a timetable.
- We're close, everything'll be fine.

51:27.320 --> 51:30.596
Remember, you work for me.
I've made my point.

51:30.840 --> 51:34.389
- Crystal clear.
- Anything I should know about?

51:34.600 --> 51:38.957
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Goodbye, Jerry. Susan.

51:39.160 --> 51:45.554
I guess this is goodbye. I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to know you.

51:47.200 --> 51:50.510
Have you ever
seen a body like this before?

51:50.760 --> 51:54.594
- She's my daughter.
- Well, then I guess you have.

51:55.040 --> 51:57.395
- Coming, Don?
- Yeah.

51:59.080 --> 52:03.153
If there's ever anything
I can do for you...

52:03.360 --> 52:06.113
...or to you,
you let me know.

52:06.960 --> 52:10.475
- Can you hammer a nail with your penis?
- Not now.

52:10.880 --> 52:14.270
A girl's gotta have her standards.

52:17.280 --> 52:19.589
- Smart girl.
- What're you doing?

52:19.840 --> 52:22.559
- You said come over.
- Stay off the rug.

52:24.640 --> 52:26.198
Take off your shoes.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.516
- What's up, doc?
- Sit down.

52:28.760 --> 52:31.638
- Who were they?
- You're of no use to me!

52:31.880 --> 52:35.555
- Interesting way to start.
- I'm giving Kent the job.

52:35.760 --> 52:38.957
- You gave me the job.
- You need a degree.

52:39.160 --> 52:43.039
- I'll pass your exam.
- Even if you pass, you don't pass.

52:43.280 --> 52:48.400
- Why don't you leave right now?
- I'll go to Dr. Meredith.

52:48.640 --> 52:54.397
- The work I've done merits a degree.
- Who will he believe, you or me?

52:56.160 --> 53:00.119
- You can't do this.
- It's done. Now get out!

53:00.320 --> 53:02.834
You'll never work in this field.

53:03.080 --> 53:06.277
- You unbelievable bastard.
- Count on it.

53:30.360 --> 53:32.112
What're you doing?

53:35.440 --> 53:41.436
I was thinking of the immortal
words of Socrates, who said:

53:42.000 --> 53:43.911
"I drank what?"

53:44.280 --> 53:46.271
Is there something wrong?

53:46.600 --> 53:50.434
Hathaway is going
to flunk me out of school.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.555
- Why?
- I screwed up.

53:55.760 --> 53:58.558
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll leave.

53:58.760 --> 54:01.149
You can't!
You'll be a failure!

54:03.000 --> 54:04.399
Thank you, Mitch.

54:09.640 --> 54:12.871
You just can't leave.
You owe me ten bucks.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.233
You can't quit.

54:20.000 --> 54:25.028
If for no other reason than
to see a five-megawatt laser fire.

54:25.480 --> 54:27.311
That would be nice.

54:29.280 --> 54:32.397
- Finish what you start.
- Who said that?

54:32.640 --> 54:34.358
You know that.

54:35.080 --> 54:39.870
That's right, Mitch.
But that's no way to motivate someone.

54:42.440 --> 54:45.034
You've got to get even
with Hathaway.

54:45.280 --> 54:47.191
It's a moral imperative.

54:49.760 --> 54:52.069
That's a good point.

58:01.080 --> 58:02.832
Vito, not again.

58:13.480 --> 58:16.040
Why don't you get some sleep.

58:16.280 --> 58:21.354
It's not like we're driving or
anything. You're still a growing boy.

58:24.840 --> 58:27.479
Hey, Lazlo.

58:29.080 --> 58:30.672
Lazlo?

58:32.960 --> 58:35.554
That's me.
Hello.

58:37.240 --> 58:39.390
I've been watching you.

58:41.240 --> 58:42.832
Thanks.

58:44.240 --> 58:50.236
I thought I'd help, so I found
every question Hathaway's asked...

58:50.640 --> 58:52.790
...on every final he's given.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.719
Gee, I didn't get you anything.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.399
Are those they?

58:59.600 --> 59:00.999
No.

59:01.200 --> 59:03.919
These are sweepstakes entries.

59:04.160 --> 59:07.038
Enter as often as you want,
so I am.

59:07.240 --> 59:10.038
That's great!
How many times?

59:10.400 --> 59:15.394
Well, this batch makes it 1,650,000.

59:15.600 --> 59:19.195
I should win 32.6% of the prizes,
plus the car.

59:19.400 --> 59:22.631
That takes the fun out of it,
doesn't it?

59:22.880 --> 59:28.193
They set up the rules, and I realized
I have certain materialistic needs.

59:28.840 --> 59:30.114
So...

59:31.080 --> 59:33.036
Where are the questions?

59:33.960 --> 59:35.996
I memorized them.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.468
Sure.

59:43.040 --> 59:45.679
I gotta go to sleep.

59:45.960 --> 59:48.315
Did you wanna borrow my pajamas?

59:48.560 --> 59:51.632
No, thanks.

59:53.680 --> 59:56.911
- Hey, he's a pretty smart kid.
- Yeah.

59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.519
He'll grow five inches
in the next year.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.200
- Mitch?
- Jordan?

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.196
Mitch Taylor?

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.668
Who...

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.596
My name is Sherry Nugil.
I've waited three years for this.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.798
- For what?
- For you to be old enough.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.555
- For what?
- For this.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.273
Come in!

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.190
Hi, Mitch!
I'm just sanding my floor!

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.152
Could you turn that off a second?!

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.390
How come you're so sweaty?

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.713
I came back from helping Chris,
and a woman was in my room.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.313
- Pardon?
- A woman. You know, she was an adult.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.275
Well, she wanted to...

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.869
- How can I say this?
- Jump you?

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.911
- Yeah.
- You made it?

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.275
- No. That's what was unbelievable.
- Pardon?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.037
I stopped her.
I told her I didn't want to.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.157
Why?

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.593
Because I really did want to.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.430
I wanted to,
but not with her.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.399
Oh.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.508
- This is my class hour!
- It's May 10th.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.550
- What are you doing here?
- Me?! What are you doing here?

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.837
Decker is dangerous!
Where's the laser?

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.640
- Coming.
- It's not even breathing hard.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.394
He wants it
by the end of the week!

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.512
Now you listen to me!
You grovelling bug!

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.719
I have exams! I'm doing what I can,
so get off my back!

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.915
That should just about do the trick,
as long as you stay cool.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.393
- Let's go, girls.
- What does that mean?

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.718
It's a figure of speech.
You guys coming to the exam?

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.476
I guess, since Hathaway's
gone to the trouble of having one.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.870
You coming, buddy boy?

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.193
I'll catch up.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.837
I don't think that's gonna
help your confidence any, do you?

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.676
Buddy boy.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.949
Let's see how funny you think this is.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.152
Buddy boy.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.231
All right, we...

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.475
We have exactly three hours.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.951
And remember,
we believe in the honour system.

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.917
It'll be apparent how many of you
haven't absorbed this material.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.833
Take one,
like your IQ was normal.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.957
Good luck, buddy boy.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:52.951
Can I name my first child after you?
"Dipshit Knight" has a nice ring.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.434
No. No!

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.953
No!

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.392
My condolences on your meltdown.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.556
What meltdown, Kent?

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.591
I'm not saying that you had one,
because how would I know?

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.910
But just in case you do.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.039
- You slime.
- It's your own fault.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:03.275
Didn't anyone ever tell you
to make sure your optics are clean?

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:44.390
I can do it!
How does it feel to be frozen?!

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.870
Ice is nice!

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:50.436
- Lazlo, buddy! Seen Mitch?
- No.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.838
He's not in there.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.510
- How'd you do?
- I passed! But I failed!

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.951
Well, then I'm happy and sad for you.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.435
Gotta find Mitch.
Mitch!

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.591
He's not in the toilet.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.799
I'll freeze it and get
at least an order of magnitude.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.879
Because it's gonna be frozen.
I think I can do it.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.308
Bye!

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.994
Hey, man!
You're not Mitch.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.876
Hey, Lazlo!
Wanna see a demonstration of gravity?

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.790
It can be done!
That's a window! That's a door!

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.028
Mitch!
Where's your math!?

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.799
Hey, you jerk!

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.992
I'm very sorry.
I'll buy you a car.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.913
I don't have one.
It's my dad's.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.635
How's it going, Jerry?

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.239
What do you want?

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.472
World peace,
but this isn't the time.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.757
- Get out!
- This might interest you.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.520
- I'm not interested.
- Dr. Hathaway...

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.149
Susan.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.113
I solved the power problem, Jerry.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.438
- Jerry?
- Take a cab.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:32.319
So you'll hammer later.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.877
We were working
on the cyanide system.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.908
Well, earlier today,
it ate itself.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:49.517
But that's just what we needed
to take a giant step forward.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.238
Right, Kent?

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.390
Needless to say,
I was despondent about the meltdown.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.115
In the midst of my preparations
for hari-kari...

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:01.157
...it came to me.

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:05.511
It's possible to synthesize
bromide in an argon matrix.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:10.555
- Excimers, frozen in an excited state.
- That's impossible.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:14.069
It's a chemical laser,
but solid, not gaseous.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:18.990
Put simply, in deference to Kent,
it's like lasing dynamite.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.513
We couple it to a state that is
radiatively coupled to the ground.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.676
Extracting 10-to-the-21 st
protons per cubic centimetre...

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:35.438
...will give 1 kilojoule per cubic
centimetre, or a megajoule per litre.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.913
Hotter than the sun.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.270
- It's small.
- It's meant to be.

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.948
We only have the one sample...

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:46.511
...and it's going to destroy itself
as it lases.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.314
But everything will be fine.

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:53.639
- Right, Mitch?
- Yeah.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.189
This is a complete waste of time.

01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:00.154
Kent, put the target
in front of the cinder blocks.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.909
Okay, come behind the shield.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.432
Okay, Mr. Taylor.
Any time you're ready.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:29.719
Ready? Laser on!

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.711
All right!

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.879
Look at this!

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.918
Wow!

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.792
- Sorry about the window.
- And the trees across the quad!

01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.839
You did it.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.359
I did my part too.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.189
You graduate.
You get the job.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.428
What? You can't!
That's my job.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.116
I've done everything
you've ever asked me to.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.440
I teach your classes for you!

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.712
- I get your laundry!
- What is he doing?

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:25.432
I mounted the optics
for the target-tracking system.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.710
Look!

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.440
Wait. Wait.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.592
- Let's celebrate!
- Absolutely.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.870
You see anything unusual
on the campus?

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:48.112
- My glasses!
- Well, try not to wobble.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:52.235
- There is a complete hole.
- That's great.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.998
Look.

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.159
Let's get a burger.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.675
- Let's go!
- In there?

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.232
This place is wild.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.993
- Do you see that?
- Like her? She's from Playa del Rey.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.873
- Am I gonna meet your parents?
- No.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:33.671
- Why? Are you ashamed of me?
- No, them.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.152
Remember the right people
to thank on this.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.630
- I'd like to thank my fish.
- What?!

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.673
- And Mr. Ikagami!
- I love it.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.113
What are you saying?

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.039
Lazlo!

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.558
I'm glad you came out.
Want a hamburger?

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.236
I've been thinking about
your laser solution.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:12.998
- You've increased it to 6 megawatts.
- Yeah, about that.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.836
- What would you use it for?
- Enormous Swiss cheese?

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.153
It can do anything.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.558
No. The beam would last for what,
15 seconds?

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:28.277
- What good is that?
- I respect you, but I graduated.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:31.637
Let the engineers figure that out.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.110
Maybe it already has a use...

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.874
...for which it's designed.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.350
Hathaway has something in mind?

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:43.155
Look at the facts.
Very high power, portable...

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:47.035
...limited firing time,
unlimited range.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.073
With a tracking system
and a mirror...

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.953
...you could vaporize
a human from space.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.715
This is not good.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.393
No!

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.711
What happened?

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.952
Oh, no.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.390
- Chris.
- I'm all right.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.791
- They took everything.
- Kent's tracking system is gone!

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.959
How could you build that mirror?!

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.510
He lied to us.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.038
It's easy to lie to you, Mitch.

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.034
You trust people.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.030
I'm a cynic.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.711
I'm such an asshole.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.872
I understand how you feel.
You're right.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.356
But we need to find out
what he's doing.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.079
Kent.

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.476
Shh, you guys!

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.598
- We'll have two minutes.
- Pardon?

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.551
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.315
Okay, open his mouth.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.951
Bulldogs.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.271
And transceiver.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.476
And tweezers.

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.080
The braces gave me the idea.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.278
Perfect antennae.
His head becomes a speaker.

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.796
It's about time someone
put it to good use.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.077
Kent?

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.513
<i>Kent.
Wake up, Kent.</i>

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.874
<i>- Kent.
- What?</i>

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.317
<i>I'm talking to you, Kent.</i>

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.469
<i>- What is this?
- I said, I'm talking to you.</i>

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.234
- No.
- Yeah.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.074
Well, I'm not asleep.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:58.833
<i>- I must be overworked.
- You're not overworked, Kent.</i>

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.315
Well, I'm not insane!

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.039
<i>- Or am I?
- That remains to be seen, Kent.</i>

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.590
But we are having a conversation.

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:16.550
<i>- Okay, who is this?
- This is Jesus, Kent.</i>

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.912
And you've been a very naughty boy!

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.357
All right, who is this?

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.677
- Cut the crap. You built a weapon.
- What?

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:34.233
What do you think a secret phase
conjugate tracking system is for?

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.358
<i>A big mirror makes a big beam.</i>

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.236
I guess it could be.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.119
Where's the laser now?

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:52.396
I overheard Jerry mention something
about a test on the 27th.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.558
<i>But I don't know where.
It's classified.</i>

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:01.630
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.038
I want you to think about
what you've done, Kent.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.389
And from now on...

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.434
<i>...stop playing with yourself!</i>

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.034
It is God.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.592
Now what?

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.079
Phase two.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.034
What is it with you?

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.794
What's that?

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:11.876
- These military are so untrusting.
- Can we get clearance?

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.636
- We will. It'll just take six hours.
- Forget it. We'll balls it.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.478
How do these look?

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.592
Mine looks like him,
and his looks like me.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.639
Great, I hope.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.559
- What if they don't work?
- They shoot us.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.319
I. D?

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.913
- Show these to the next guard.
- You bet.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.794
I.D. s?

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:58.671
Can you snap it up?
We're late, we're tired, we're hungry.

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:03.070
- Are you crazy?
- You gotta intimidate these guys.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.118
You're not on the list.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.272
Yeah, that's because we're classified.

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.352
Security.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.995
Aren't you young for technicians?

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.316
Lasers are a young science.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.830
There, I said it.
Now we're both in trouble.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:28.198
- I'll call the duty officer.
- Hey there, Airborne.

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.400
Make that call, and it's our jobs.
We're four hours late.

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:42.952
Give us a break. Someday you'll
be in the private sector.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.230
Yeah.

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.556
We're dead.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.236
- All right!
- I love it!

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:02.749
Absolutely, sir.
Consider it done.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.797
Yes, sir.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:10.428
Look for anything
out of the ordinary.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.035
Mitch, come here.

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:17.519
My God.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.519
Come on.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.237
- Communication link?
- Open.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:55.830
Diagnostics seem okay.
Final check ready.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.958
Sixty-five degrees, nineteen minutes.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.869
All systems go.
We're finished here, fellas.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.108
What!?

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:49.349
This little polynomial will
keep the computer busy.

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:54.029
Where are they?

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.433
We've got a connection!
They're in!

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.950
<i>- Abbott to Costello.
- Go ahead.</i>

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:14.909
<i>- We've got the goodies.
- We've got target coordinates.</i>

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:18.678
Roger, we're sending.

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.270
What is it?

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.113
Oh, nothing.

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.878
You didn't think we'd
test in space?

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.318
Yes, I did, because
that's what it was designed for.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.235
But if you want to crawl
before we walk...

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.517
...that's fine too.
Really.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.792
- Attention!
- What?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.958
- Superior officer in the room!
- As you were.

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:57.556
We're ready for the final
on-board laser check.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.033
All clear.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:14.312
I'm replacing the PROM
with our EPROM.

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.112
Okay, shoot.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.031
May I have the coordinates, please?

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:34.469
34 degrees, 10 minutes.
15.21 seconds north.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:39.951
119 degrees, 7 minutes...

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.472
Right this way.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.070
I'm gonna check the stairs.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.959
Hathaway's coming!

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:07.909
Mitch has told me that
Herr Professor is approaching.

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.350
- What now?
- Hathaway's coming.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.110
I don't work well under pressure.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.277
Watch your head there.

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.028
I hope that works.

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.114
Okay, Chris, I mean, Abbott.
Hello? Hello?

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.157
They're gone!

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.794
- Okay. Fine.
- Fine.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:38.989
Dr. Goy can answer
any questions you might have.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.431
Is there any problem
with reusing the weapon?

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:48.869
No, the fuel is frozen
and contains a self-sufficient unit.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.356
The beauty of this system is...

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.919
- Is everything all right here?
- Why shouldn't it be?

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.837
I think that
just about sums it up.

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.355
Shall we take our exit?

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.239
- Okay, they're gone.
- That was close.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.039
Nothing like borrowing a B-1,
huh, general?

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.548
What is it?

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.955
Nothing.

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:43.356
Diagnosis of schizophrenia
by objective personal analysis...

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.036
<i>Hi, Kent.</i>

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:51.028
Oh, I thought you'd gone.

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:54.829
<i>Not yet.
Have you been touching yourself?</i>

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.516
Yes. I mean, no!

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.672
<i>Good.
Listen, Kent.</i>

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:05.957
<i>Dad, you know, God,
wants to show you something.</i>

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:08.555
Why?
I meant what?

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.558
I've learned not to ask.

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:15.349
He says to wait in front of
Dr. Hathaway's house...

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:21.596
<i>...at 639 Ivy Crest Drive,
at precisely 7:08 this morning.</i>

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:23.908
Ivy Crest?

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:29.234
<i>Wait there and you shall receive
a sign, but do not go inside.</i>

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.635
Well, why not?

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.388
Hello?

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.113
Hello, Jesus?

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.273
He hung up.

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:03.558
Crossbow One, radar contact,
heading 0-2-5.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:07.036
Maintain flight level 6-5-0.

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:12.035
<i>Roger. Steer 0-2-5 out of five thousand
for flight level 6-5-0.</i>

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:37.797
They're here.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:46.831
Mr. Knight, why is it that I am
not surprised to see you here?

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:53.030
I suppose you have an explanation
for this event that we're to witness.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:57.831
First, let me compliment you
on your fashion sense.

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.315
Particularly your slippers.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.356
Yes, well, Philomena likes them.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.113
Hey, guys!

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.591
Good morning.

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:15.277
Congressman Doogan.
What brings you around?

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.758
I was told there was a situation
of international importance.

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:31.031
The weapon is controlled from
this module, as it would be in space.

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.352
This is an exact duplicate
of the cockpit.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:36.750
The accuracy will be as exact.

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:42.239
<i>- We are nearing the target.
- Open the bomb bay doors.</i>

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.956
- Those are serious accusations.
- I know.

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:57.715
If it's true,
I'm going to need proof.

01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:01.270
We can accommodate you
in just one minute.

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:03.476
Duck.

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:07.196
Congressman?

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:50.000
Now, listen to me, Jesus.

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:55.910
This is Jerry's house,
and we're very close.

01:31:56.120 --> 01:32:00.238
If you don't answer me,
I'm just gonna have to go in.

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:05.229
- So I'm going.
- No, Kent!

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.632
- Get away!
- Kent!

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.549
Target locked.
In ten.

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:19.639
<i>Nine.</i>

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.993
<i>E ight.</i>

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.832
- Kent!
- Come out, Kent!

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:45.554
Okay, God!
Let me have it!

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.114
Popcorn!

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.756
I don't understand.
Did it fire?

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.036
Yes, but there's a problem.

01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:59.755
- It's not shutting down.
- Well, shut it down!

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:02.633
- What's the problem?
- Shut it down!

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.114
Kent!

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.557
Kent.

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.798
- Kent, you okay?
- That was great!

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:51.356
Something is very wrong.

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.676
Out!

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:56.511
Unlock the bird's-eye.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:58.348
Unlocked.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.513
I'm tracking where the shot went.
I want to know it worked.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:14.639
Oh, no.

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:19.559
- My house.
- What have you done?

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.191
All right!

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:51.749
It's Hollyfeld...

01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.678
...in a Winnebago!

01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.350
Lazlo, buddy!

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.955
I think we used too much.

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:09.031
- I'm sorry you missed it.
- I had to pack.

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:11.629
- Why?
- Well, I'm getting married.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.276
- To whom?
- What is all this stuff?

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:19.713
Oh, yeah. I won,
31.8% of the prizes.

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:22.918
I'll figure it out.
But not this summer.

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:27.109
Sherry?
Sherry Nugil?

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.473
Isn't it great?
This is number one.

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.710
I've been looking for him
for ten years.

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:47.153
- What can I say? She loves me.
- Congratulations.

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:53.273
- You'll have to come and visit us.
- What?

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:57.029
I have a little
survival place in Wyoming.

01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.755
Yeah, it's getting
kinda weird around here.

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:03.952
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.310
- Is it getting too weird around here?
- Absolutely.

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:25.115
- I didn't notice.
- I like it.
