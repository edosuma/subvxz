00:15.686 --> 00:19.045
You have a ten-second firing window.
Ready?

00:20.285 --> 00:21.885
Ready.

00:22.964 --> 00:24.444
Go.

00:32.682 --> 00:34.362
Time.

00:36.241 --> 00:37.962
Any better?

00:38.162 --> 00:41.121
Your hit-to-miss ratio
is still below 50 percent.

00:41.321 --> 00:42.920
If those had been live rounds,

00:43.120 --> 00:45.880
you'd have blown out
two or three bulkheads.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.839
I never had this much trouble
with the EM-33.

00:50.599 --> 00:53.238
This is an entirely new weapon.

00:54.118 --> 00:58.237
Unlike the EM-33, you don't have
to compensate for particle drift.

00:58.477 --> 01:02.156
Just point straight at the target.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.756
And try and keep your
shoulders relaxed.

01:04.956 --> 01:08.315
It's hard to aim accurately
when you're tense.

01:10.675 --> 01:13.914
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

01:14.154 --> 01:18.233
You'll get the hang of it.
Let's try for 20 seconds this time.

01:22.032 --> 01:24.791
I thought we were staying at warp
for the next few days.

01:25.111 --> 01:29.031
Oh, we're approaching a gas giant.
Class 9.

01:29.831 --> 01:31.911
So much for target practice.

01:32.871 --> 01:34.710
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

01:39.549 --> 01:44.868
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:47.347 --> 01:50.746
"It's been a long time"

01:50.906 --> 01:54.786
"But my time is finally near"

01:54.986 --> 01:59.265
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:59.465 --> 02:02.384
"I will touch the sky"

02:02.584 --> 02:06.383
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

02:06.543 --> 02:09.583
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

02:09.823 --> 02:14.502
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

02:14.781 --> 02:17.702
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

02:17.862 --> 02:22.421
"I've got faith to believe"

02:22.661 --> 02:25.220
"I can do anything"

02:25.420 --> 02:29.939
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:30.139 --> 02:33.018
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:33.218 --> 02:38.577
"I can reach any star"

02:38.937 --> 02:42.657
"I've got faith"

02:42.897 --> 02:46.576
"I've got faith"

02:46.816 --> 02:51.615
"Faith of the heart"

03:10.237 --> 03:13.197
The probe's entered
the outer atmosphere.

03:13.676 --> 03:17.115
- Can we clean up the signal?
- I'm trying, sir.

03:17.275 --> 03:22.753
There's a lot of EM interference.
It sounds very strange.

03:22.913 --> 03:26.871
Intense magnetic fields often create
unique waveforms.

03:28.631 --> 03:30.470
Let's hear them.

03:37.029 --> 03:39.348
Siren calls.

03:39.988 --> 03:42.267
That's what we called them
when I was a kid.

03:42.467 --> 03:46.786
My dad put them through the speakers
whenever we flew by a gas giant.

03:47.345 --> 03:50.105
It gave me nightmares sometimes.

03:52.103 --> 03:54.223
Other than keeping
Ensign Mayweather up at night,

03:54.463 --> 03:57.502
I'm not sure what we expect
to accomplish here.

03:57.702 --> 04:00.261
There are four gas giants
in your own solar system.

04:00.461 --> 04:02.141
None of them are Class 9.

04:02.341 --> 04:05.300
I think this one's worth a closer look.

04:10.698 --> 04:14.937
I'm reading an anomalous power
signature in the lower atmosphere.

04:15.417 --> 04:17.696
And several bio-signs.

04:20.454 --> 04:23.135
- Get the probe closer.
- Aye, sir.

04:31.932 --> 04:34.411
We can travel faster
than the speed of light.

04:34.651 --> 04:37.289
You'd think we could find a cure
for the common cold.

04:37.489 --> 04:40.609
You should be grateful.
A human cold is so mild.

04:40.809 --> 04:44.888
I once had a patient with
the Kamaraazite flu.

04:45.087 --> 04:50.166
He sneezed so violently,
he nearly regurgitated his pineal gland.

04:50.726 --> 04:52.926
I don't see how I could
actually catch a cold

04:53.206 --> 04:55.444
on a hermetically sealed starship.

04:55.684 --> 04:58.603
Oh, you may have picked up the virus
from a piece of equipment.

04:58.763 --> 05:02.082
It could have been lurking
inside a sealed container.

05:02.282 --> 05:04.281
I did open a case of plasma coolant.

05:04.481 --> 05:08.360
Well, whoever packed that case
was probably nursing a cold.

05:09.320 --> 05:13.199
But that was back in space dock
five months ago.

05:13.359 --> 05:16.198
You underestimate the tenacity
of a virus, lieutenant.

05:16.358 --> 05:21.396
It can lay dormant for months, adapt to
whatever environment it finds itself in.

05:21.836 --> 05:24.755
This should ease the symptoms.

05:25.195 --> 05:29.554
But the only cure I know of
involves bed rest.

05:29.754 --> 05:31.672
No, that will have to wait.

05:31.872 --> 05:35.551
The captain wants me on the team
investigating that shipwreck.

05:35.751 --> 05:37.912
You won't be contagious inside
an environment suit.

05:38.192 --> 05:41.430
Just try not to sneeze
in your helmet.

05:43.550 --> 05:45.589
I'll do my best.

05:51.747 --> 05:53.386
Come in.

05:55.386 --> 05:56.785
Hoshi.

05:56.985 --> 06:00.184
- Do you have a minute, sir?
- Of course. What's on your mind?

06:00.384 --> 06:02.143
That shipwreck.

06:02.303 --> 06:06.303
We have no idea what type of life
forms we'll find on that alien vessel.

06:06.502 --> 06:09.861
And there's a lot of interference
in the atmosphere.

06:10.101 --> 06:13.540
Are you sure the Away Team
won't need a translator?

06:13.980 --> 06:17.818
They have their UTs, and we'll try
to keep an open comlink.

06:18.018 --> 06:21.537
What about the language on
the control panels, the hatches?

06:21.737 --> 06:24.976
They might need someone to help
them find their way around.

06:25.216 --> 06:27.695
Are you trying to tell me something?

06:29.336 --> 06:31.575
I realize that I haven't always been

06:31.815 --> 06:36.773
the first one in line to volunteer
for this type of mission.

06:36.973 --> 06:40.172
But I want you to know that I'm
prepared to go.

06:40.732 --> 06:44.530
Took a while, but I think I finally
got my space legs.

06:44.810 --> 06:46.769
I never doubted that you'd find them.

06:48.969 --> 06:51.567
Your timing couldn't be better.

06:52.647 --> 06:55.367
T'Pol just asked me
to assign you to the team.

06:56.767 --> 07:00.046
You'd better get to the launch bay
before they leave without you.

07:00.605 --> 07:02.365
Aye, sir.

07:13.361 --> 07:15.601
I thought you were acquainted
with the environmental suit.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.000
I am. I'm just brushing up
on the backup systems.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.839
I wouldn't want the emergency oxygen
to fail during a hull breach.

07:22.039 --> 07:24.598
Trust me, ensign.
If there's a hull breach,

07:24.798 --> 07:29.156
the pressure will crush you
into something about this big.

07:31.836 --> 07:33.915
I requested you for your skills
as a translator,

07:34.195 --> 07:37.793
- but if you're uncomfortable...
- I'm perfectly comfortable.

07:39.873 --> 07:43.353
I used to find the suits a little
claustrophobic...

07:44.553 --> 07:46.511
...but I'm getting used to them.

07:46.631 --> 07:49.270
I'll see you in the shuttlepod.

07:58.787 --> 08:02.506
It's 100 kilometres below us,
still descending.

08:02.746 --> 08:05.665
Gravity's pulling it deeper
into the atmosphere.

08:05.864 --> 08:11.104
At their current altitude,
the pressure is 15,000 g.s.c.

08:11.624 --> 08:15.302
- That's well within our hull tolerance.
- For the moment.

08:15.542 --> 08:19.621
But at the rate that vessel is sinking,
we'll have an hour at most.

08:19.821 --> 08:22.579
You sound uncomfortable,
sub-commander.

08:22.779 --> 08:24.299
I'm merely stating facts.

08:24.499 --> 08:27.658
We'll be on our way back
well before we're in any danger.

08:27.858 --> 08:31.016
I for one have no interest
in imploding a valuable shuttlepod.

08:31.296 --> 08:33.457
Or three valuable officers.

08:36.535 --> 08:38.895
We've entered an eddy
of liquid helium.

08:45.933 --> 08:49.051
- We're clear.
- That wasn't so bad.

08:55.090 --> 08:56.689
One hundred metres.

08:57.449 --> 09:00.728
- Is that a hatch on the port side?
- I see it.

09:02.128 --> 09:04.647
Fifty metres.

09:04.807 --> 09:06.887
Forty.

09:08.445 --> 09:10.685
- What's that?
- It's just the proximity alarm.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.124
Twenty metres.

09:13.364 --> 09:15.604
Ten.

09:18.682 --> 09:20.722
Engaging docking interface.

09:30.199 --> 09:32.599
Nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.

09:32.759 --> 09:36.757
Carbon dioxide levels are high,
but nothing's toxic.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.636
It's breathable.

09:38.796 --> 09:40.556
You first.

09:54.711 --> 09:56.751
Perhaps we should leave
the helmets on.

09:56.991 --> 09:58.550
What is it?

09:58.710 --> 10:03.228
- You can't smell that?
- No. This damn cold.

10:03.428 --> 10:04.708
Count your blessings.

10:15.905 --> 10:18.505
You two might wanna
take a look at this.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.463
It says, "Deck 2, Red Sector."

10:21.703 --> 10:23.742
What language?

10:24.662 --> 10:26.182
Klingon.

10:30.060 --> 10:31.979
I thought you knew Klingon ships.

10:32.259 --> 10:34.539
Why didn't you recognize this one
from the outside?

10:34.779 --> 10:38.258
There are many classes of ships.
I'm not familiar with all of them.

10:38.418 --> 10:41.777
So I'm assuming you don't know
how many Klingons are onboard.

10:41.977 --> 10:44.017
I'm reading three bio-signs.

10:44.257 --> 10:47.135
That way. All very weak.

10:47.375 --> 10:49.334
How weak?

11:20.445 --> 11:21.845
They're still alive.

11:22.523 --> 11:25.083
We should leave before
they regain consciousness.

11:25.363 --> 11:26.362
And what if they don't?

11:26.562 --> 11:29.123
The atmosphere's gonna crush
this ship like an eggshell soon.

11:29.363 --> 11:32.281
- Shouldn't we try to help them?
- They don't want our help.

11:32.521 --> 11:35.360
- How do you know?
- They're Klingons.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.520
To die at their posts assures them
a path to the afterlife.

11:38.759 --> 11:41.318
If we rescue them,
they'd be dishonoured.

11:41.558 --> 11:45.077
Well, I for one don't intend to
just fly off and let these people die,

11:45.317 --> 11:46.917
honourable deaths or not.

11:47.116 --> 11:50.555
Your compassion is admirable
but misguided.

11:50.755 --> 11:54.915
If they awake and find us
on their ship, they'll kill us.

12:21.186 --> 12:24.066
- How many are there?
- Three on the bridge.

12:24.306 --> 12:27.704
But I'm detecting at least nine more
bio-signs onboard.

12:27.944 --> 12:30.183
You can't tell what happened
to them?

12:30.463 --> 12:33.982
I'm detecting residual amounts of
a carbon-dioxide-based neurotoxin.

12:34.182 --> 12:37.580
But it seems to have dissipated.
There's not enough to afect us.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.820
Stand by.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.699
How long is the pod's hull
going to hold up?

12:42.899 --> 12:45.419
At their present rate of descent...

12:45.938 --> 12:48.138
...half-hour, give or take.

12:51.697 --> 12:53.536
- T'Pol.
- Yes, captain.

12:53.736 --> 12:57.255
You've got 20 minutes to see
if you can do anything for that crew.

12:57.495 --> 12:59.934
Then I want you out of there.
Understood?

13:00.094 --> 13:02.532
I don't believe there's anything
we can do in 20 minutes.

13:02.772 --> 13:06.891
- I suggest we leave now.
- You have a margin of safety.

13:08.092 --> 13:09.692
Captain?

13:12.690 --> 13:14.889
T'Pol to Enterprise.

13:17.049 --> 13:19.448
- Damn interference.
- Or we've dropped out of com range.

13:19.608 --> 13:21.007
We still have 20 minutes.

13:21.167 --> 13:24.086
It doesn't make sense to place
ourselves at risk when they'd rather die.

13:24.366 --> 13:26.126
There must be something
we can do.

13:26.326 --> 13:28.645
Maybe they have a distress beacon
we can activate.

13:28.844 --> 13:31.563
I doubt you'll find one.
Klingons don't call for help.

13:31.803 --> 13:33.404
What if we carry some of them
into the pod?

13:33.844 --> 13:35.963
We could save three or four.

13:36.123 --> 13:38.642
And if they wake up
on the trip back to Enterprise?

14:20.509 --> 14:24.308
- What's that?
- It's our shuttlepod taking off.

14:36.624 --> 14:38.623
Try it now.

14:40.623 --> 14:42.222
Archer to T'Pol.

14:42.461 --> 14:44.541
What's your status?

14:48.021 --> 14:49.421
They're back in com range.

14:49.661 --> 14:51.699
Captain.

14:52.779 --> 14:55.818
Shuttlepod One, respond.

14:58.138 --> 15:01.216
Sir, they're heading into open space.

15:03.375 --> 15:05.895
I'm picking up something.

15:11.093 --> 15:12.772
Sounds like Klingon.

15:13.693 --> 15:15.453
I'll try to tie in the UT.

15:20.050 --> 15:22.130
- In range. Respond.

15:22.370 --> 15:26.648
We've been attacked by an unknown
ship, designation Enterprise NX-01.

15:26.848 --> 15:30.167
Any warships in range, respond.

15:30.367 --> 15:33.086
- Set a pursuit course.
- Aye, sir.

15:34.246 --> 15:36.724
Bring the grappler online.

15:47.082 --> 15:49.002
We've got it.

15:50.121 --> 15:51.641
Bridge to Security.

15:51.841 --> 15:54.159
Send a team to Launch Bay 1.
Trip.

15:54.359 --> 15:57.199
- The bridge is yours, Travis.
- Yes, sir.

16:36.707 --> 16:38.826
Everybody all right?

16:46.624 --> 16:49.062
- Archer to the bridge.
- Mayweather.

16:49.302 --> 16:50.902
Have you still got a fix
on the shipwreck?

16:51.102 --> 16:52.621
Yes, sir.

16:52.821 --> 16:55.342
Transfer the coordinates
to the launch bay.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.260
I'm going back
for the boarding party.

16:57.460 --> 17:00.060
Sir, the alien ship sunk
another 2000 metres.

17:00.259 --> 17:02.739
It's below the shuttle's safety limits.

17:05.857 --> 17:08.297
Then polarise the hull plating.

17:09.136 --> 17:10.695
We'll take Enterprise down.

17:12.056 --> 17:13.855
There's got to be some way
off this ship.

17:14.055 --> 17:15.334
What about escape pods?

17:15.534 --> 17:18.214
I don't know about the structural
integrity of Klingon escape pods.

17:18.414 --> 17:20.214
My guess is we're better off in here.

17:20.414 --> 17:25.051
It's irrelevant, lieutenant.
Klingons don't use escape pods.

17:25.771 --> 17:28.731
It would be considered an act
of cowardice to abandon ship.

17:28.931 --> 17:31.650
Maybe we can use their com system
to contact Enterprise.

17:31.850 --> 17:35.328
I doubt their com will penetrate the
EM field any better than our own.

17:35.528 --> 17:37.448
If we can access
their helm controls,

17:37.648 --> 17:39.847
we might be able to put this vessel
into a stable orbit.

17:40.047 --> 17:43.366
I haven't had much experience
at piloting Klingon ships.

17:43.566 --> 17:46.006
We have no other choice.

17:50.684 --> 17:52.523
Start translating those consoles.

17:52.723 --> 17:55.242
Look for anything marked "propulsion,"
"helm," "navigation."

17:55.442 --> 17:59.081
I'll try, but reading Klingon is
a lot different than speaking it.

17:59.281 --> 18:02.360
We could always try waking
one of them to help us.

18:02.560 --> 18:03.919
All right.

18:13.597 --> 18:17.116
"Plasma containment," maybe?

18:17.316 --> 18:19.634
You're certain?

18:19.834 --> 18:21.794
"Containment."

18:22.714 --> 18:24.833
I'm certain.

18:36.070 --> 18:38.829
Something they call
"photon torpedoes."

18:39.069 --> 18:42.948
Photon torpedoes? I've never heard
of anything like that. What else?

18:43.188 --> 18:45.226
Well, this all looks like
weapons systems.

18:45.426 --> 18:48.506
Torpedoes, tactical sensors,
disruptor arrays.

18:49.065 --> 18:51.425
What about this one?

18:55.183 --> 18:57.622
I recognize "pressure."

18:58.863 --> 19:01.902
That can mean "wall," or "barrier."

19:02.102 --> 19:04.741
- Or "hull"?
- Maybe.

19:04.941 --> 19:07.860
If I'm reading this correctly,
we've got a few hours at most.

19:08.020 --> 19:09.979
The hull integrity is failing.

19:10.259 --> 19:12.298
Then we better hurry.

19:12.538 --> 19:15.337
This appears to be the helm station.

19:15.577 --> 19:18.616
I think you're right.
"Lmpulse drive."

19:18.776 --> 19:20.856
Good work, Hoshi.

19:30.932 --> 19:32.012
Hoshi?

19:32.212 --> 19:35.331
It says the pressure's failing
in the...

19:35.571 --> 19:37.571
"Fusion manifold."
Do you know what that means?

19:37.971 --> 19:41.929
To quote our very own Mr Tucker,
it means we're dead in the water.

19:42.209 --> 19:45.288
Archer to boarding party.
Come in.

19:47.527 --> 19:48.887
We read you, captain.

19:49.047 --> 19:51.846
- How are you holding up?
- We're doing okay, sir.

19:52.006 --> 19:53.686
It's nice to hear your voice.

19:53.886 --> 19:55.206
What's your status?

19:55.486 --> 19:57.364
We've been attempting
to restart their engines,

19:57.604 --> 19:59.404
but they appear to be off-line.

19:59.644 --> 20:02.683
Don't worry about it.
We're coming to get you.

20:03.962 --> 20:05.722
Travis, how much farther?

20:05.962 --> 20:10.200
Ten thousand metres, but I'm having
a hard time getting a fix on them.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.599
Too much interference.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.838
- Is our probe still working?
- Barely.

20:19.038 --> 20:21.957
Try using it to triangulate
their position.

20:27.675 --> 20:29.674
The probe's gone.

20:33.912 --> 20:36.752
Sir, external pressure's at maximum.

20:40.752 --> 20:43.910
I'm afraid we've got a little hitch
in our rescue plan.

20:45.710 --> 20:48.189
The hull plating's failing.

20:51.387 --> 20:53.187
We'll be back for you
as soon as we can.

20:53.427 --> 20:56.266
In the meantime, just sit tight...

20:57.906 --> 21:00.225
Captain, you're breaking up.

21:01.304 --> 21:03.144
Captain?

21:09.822 --> 21:15.340
Release me. Cowards!
Let me die on my feet.

21:15.820 --> 21:17.340
T'Pol was right.

21:17.580 --> 21:20.018
There's a neurotoxin
in her bloodstream.

21:20.258 --> 21:22.938
Untreated, it could kill her
within a day or two.

21:23.178 --> 21:25.777
- Can you do anything?
- I'm working on it.

21:25.977 --> 21:29.056
T'Pol said the Klingons
were unconscious.

21:29.296 --> 21:31.256
Why is this one so lively?

21:31.456 --> 21:33.695
She's showing the effects
of hypothermia.

21:33.895 --> 21:35.255
My guess is, she took refuge

21:35.455 --> 21:37.733
in a low-temperature environment
aboard her ship.

21:37.893 --> 21:40.252
The cold would have delayed
the effects of the toxin.

21:40.412 --> 21:43.652
I demand to speak to your captain.

21:43.812 --> 21:46.290
You know, I read if they sense
a leader's weak,

21:46.530 --> 21:49.169
they'll try to kill him
and take command.

21:54.049 --> 21:56.128
I'm the captain.

21:57.767 --> 21:59.487
I've never seen your kind before,

21:59.767 --> 22:02.766
but you have made an enemy
of the Klingon Empire.

22:02.886 --> 22:06.084
From what I've noticed,
that's not hard to do.

22:06.724 --> 22:09.124
You stranded three of my people
down there.

22:09.323 --> 22:11.603
You raided my vessel,
infected my crew.

22:11.803 --> 22:14.001
We didn't infect anyone.

22:14.201 --> 22:17.960
- We boarded your ship to try and help.
- Liar.

22:19.241 --> 22:22.359
Look, I don't know what happened
to your crew,

22:22.559 --> 22:25.759
but we had nothing
to do with it.

22:25.919 --> 22:28.158
Now your vessel is sinking deeper
into the atmosphere.

22:28.318 --> 22:31.836
Unless we do something,
it'll be destroyed.

22:32.076 --> 22:35.195
Better that than let it fall
into your hands.

22:37.355 --> 22:41.913
I've got three very capable people
on your ship. Let them help.

22:42.632 --> 22:46.113
If you tell them how to get the engines
running, they can fly it out of there.

22:46.353 --> 22:50.791
And fly it where? Back to your world
to steal our secrets?

22:51.630 --> 22:52.790
No.

22:53.350 --> 22:57.709
When our birds-of-prey arrive,
your ship will be destroyed.

23:04.346 --> 23:07.225
Remind me to stop
trying to help people.

23:15.144 --> 23:17.582
I found these schematics
in the Vulcan database.

23:17.822 --> 23:19.742
It's a Raptor-class scout vessel.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.501
How long will it last down there?

23:22.741 --> 23:24.859
Lts hull's at least twice as thick
as ours,

23:25.019 --> 23:28.019
reinforced with some kind of
coherent molecular alloy.

23:28.219 --> 23:33.418
Yeah, it's a tough little ship, but it can't
hold up under that pressure forever.

23:37.776 --> 23:41.175
What if we use duratanium braces
to reinforce a shuttlepod?

23:41.375 --> 23:43.014
It won't look pretty,

23:43.174 --> 23:46.593
but it might hold up long enough
for us to get our people out.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.973
Our only other option is
for T'Pol and Malcolm

23:49.133 --> 23:53.051
to fix a broken-down Klingon ship
and fly it out themselves.

23:55.570 --> 23:59.010
I don't think we're gonna get any help
from our guest in Sickbay.

24:00.490 --> 24:02.808
Get started on those braces.

24:03.008 --> 24:05.088
Keep an eye out for any Klingon ships
coming this way.

24:05.328 --> 24:06.927
Aye, sir.

24:09.607 --> 24:12.085
The one time we need our
chief engineer...

24:12.285 --> 24:14.285
...is the one time
we leave him behind.

24:14.324 --> 24:16.444
Come look at this.

24:32.959 --> 24:35.039
Class planet.

24:35.159 --> 24:37.437
We destroyed their ship,

24:37.677 --> 24:42.076
but we've sustained damage
in our port fusion injector.

24:42.756 --> 24:47.874
We've descended into the outer
atmosphere of a Q'tahL-class planet

24:48.113 --> 24:53.593
to make repairs in case there are
other Xarantine ships in the area.

24:59.431 --> 25:04.589
My crew is falling ill, and I have been
unable to determine why.

25:04.948 --> 25:07.428
If we had died when
the Xarantine attacked,

25:07.668 --> 25:09.307
our honour would be secure.

25:09.587 --> 25:13.106
But to fall victim to some disease,

25:13.266 --> 25:19.065
to be crushed into nothing in the
depths of this miserable planet...

25:24.583 --> 25:27.862
Sounds like we need to find
the port fusion injector.

25:28.062 --> 25:30.461
Wait, I saw that somewhere.

25:35.499 --> 25:37.339
Here. One deck below us.

25:37.539 --> 25:39.899
It's in the "Reactor Pit."

25:40.139 --> 25:42.337
Reactor Pit?
Could that be Engineering?

25:42.497 --> 25:44.417
Could be.

26:07.011 --> 26:09.769
- This one?
- No.

26:09.929 --> 26:13.048
That says something about
plasma induction.

26:21.165 --> 26:23.125
Here it is.

26:25.444 --> 26:27.683
"Port fusion injector."

26:40.280 --> 26:44.038
I think I might have made a tactical
error dealing with the Klingon woman.

26:44.238 --> 26:45.957
I asked her for help.

26:46.117 --> 26:48.037
She could see that
as a sign of weakness.

26:48.237 --> 26:51.516
You been boning up on your
Klingon psychology?

26:52.236 --> 26:54.675
We've run into them three times.

26:54.875 --> 26:56.515
Every time they've wanted
to destroy us.

26:56.675 --> 26:59.074
I'd love to figure out why.

26:59.314 --> 27:01.712
Well, maybe the best thing is
just to steer clear of them.

27:01.952 --> 27:06.511
That might not be so easy.
And we could use their help right now.

27:07.911 --> 27:11.309
If we could reestablish a com signal
with T'Pol and the others,

27:11.509 --> 27:15.228
the Klingon woman could probably
talk them through the repairs.

27:15.348 --> 27:19.388
But she's got 1,000 generations
of instinct telling her not to trust me.

27:19.588 --> 27:22.946
Maybe it's time you start
thinking like a Klingon.

27:43.460 --> 27:46.380
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.418
I seem to be getting
a little light-headed.

27:49.738 --> 27:51.697
Must be the heat.

27:52.377 --> 27:54.617
You're dehydrated.
You need some water.

27:54.897 --> 27:58.175
I saw a galley on the schematics.
Deck 4, Blue Sector.

27:58.335 --> 27:59.575
I'll see what I can find.

27:59.855 --> 28:01.214
You shouldn't go alone.

28:04.134 --> 28:06.372
Watch yourselves.

28:23.727 --> 28:25.046
It's called "gagh."

28:25.286 --> 28:28.446
It's a Klingon delicacy,
but only when they're alive.

28:28.606 --> 28:32.524
- They look like worms.
- They are worms.

29:29.707 --> 29:31.866
Targs.

29:32.066 --> 29:35.305
Klingons prefer their food
freshly slaughtered.

29:39.184 --> 29:40.583
Are you all right?

29:40.863 --> 29:43.303
I promised myself I wouldn't do this.

29:44.222 --> 29:47.981
You're in a dangerous situation
in an alien environment.

29:48.181 --> 29:50.581
Your anxiety is understandable.

29:53.179 --> 29:57.818
- Don't you mean "for a human"?
- You can't deny your nature.

29:58.098 --> 30:00.418
This may sound strange...

30:02.416 --> 30:05.136
...but I envy you sometimes.

30:05.375 --> 30:10.574
I know, another pesky
human emotion.

30:11.813 --> 30:15.693
But there are times I wish I could
just ignore my feelings.

30:16.333 --> 30:19.372
Bury them, the way Vulcans do.

30:22.610 --> 30:24.090
Take my hand.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.689
Excuse me?

30:29.528 --> 30:31.327
My hand.

30:39.645 --> 30:40.965
Close your eyes.

30:47.682 --> 30:50.802
Think of yourself
on a turbulent ocean.

30:52.961 --> 30:56.160
You have the power
to control the waves.

30:59.718 --> 31:02.238
Whatever it is you're trying to do,
it's not working.

31:02.478 --> 31:04.158
Focus.

31:06.157 --> 31:08.476
The waves are subsiding.

31:09.036 --> 31:11.676
The water is growing still.

31:14.674 --> 31:17.273
You're in control.

31:28.990 --> 31:32.430
That was amazing.

31:33.068 --> 31:34.948
When we return to the ship,

31:35.148 --> 31:38.547
I'll teach you how to do it
on your own.

31:39.787 --> 31:40.947
Thanks.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.384
Lieutenant Reed, report.

31:48.304 --> 31:50.303
The hull pressure's
approaching critical.

31:50.543 --> 31:53.022
This ship's about to be crushed.

32:03.099 --> 32:05.459
It will work.

32:06.778 --> 32:09.297
If you're wrong, you could destroy
the ship.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.975
Look, even with Hoshi's help,

32:15.175 --> 32:18.054
it could take hours just to find
the fusion injector in here.

32:18.255 --> 32:20.854
- We're out of time.
- I say we try the weapons.

32:21.094 --> 32:24.093
How do you know you can
even access the tactical systems?

32:24.373 --> 32:27.251
If there's one thing onboard this ship
I ought to be able to figure out,

32:27.451 --> 32:28.811
it's the torpedoes.

32:29.451 --> 32:32.930
I'd like to run one more structural
diagnostic before you launch.

32:36.728 --> 32:39.408
- Beg your pardon?
- Success.

32:39.927 --> 32:43.007
I decided to take your advice
about thinking like a Klingon.

32:43.488 --> 32:46.566
The Vulcan database has
about 900 pages on them.

32:46.806 --> 32:49.165
- Learn anything?
- Plenty.

32:49.325 --> 32:51.085
They're driven by a warrior mentality.

32:51.245 --> 32:54.363
They tend to view anyone they meet
as a potential enemy.

32:55.163 --> 32:58.202
That might explain why
our guest is so irritable.

32:58.442 --> 33:01.121
They also have
a strong sense of duty.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.999
"Death before dishonour."

33:09.639 --> 33:11.639
Finish up that diagnostic.
I'll be in Sickbay.

33:11.878 --> 33:15.237
- Gonna put your homework to use?
- Something like that.

33:24.394 --> 33:26.353
Please relax.

33:26.553 --> 33:29.193
If you strain against the straps,
you might hurt yourself.

33:29.393 --> 33:33.392
What's that? Is that what you used
against my crew?

33:33.592 --> 33:37.071
Dr Phlox has developed an antidote
to the neurotoxin in your system.

33:37.791 --> 33:40.789
Is this how you plan
to gain my trust?

33:40.989 --> 33:45.268
First poison me,
then miraculously cure me?

33:47.067 --> 33:50.106
- Have you had a drink lately?
- What?

33:50.306 --> 33:53.665
The bio-agent that affected you
and your crew was consumed.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.064
Apparently, in alcohol.

33:56.304 --> 34:01.943
Specifically, the toxin was bonded to
a molecule unique to Xarantine ale.

34:03.902 --> 34:07.620
- There was a raid.
- Yes?

34:10.500 --> 34:12.579
I can understand your not wanting
to talk about it,

34:12.779 --> 34:15.058
if the raid went badly for you.

34:15.297 --> 34:16.976
The Xarantines are no match for us.

34:17.177 --> 34:19.697
We attacked their outpost
and took what we wanted.

34:19.976 --> 34:23.176
And that included
some Xarantine ale?

34:24.255 --> 34:26.775
Did your whole crew drink it?

34:26.975 --> 34:28.853
The triumph belonged to all.

34:29.054 --> 34:31.654
I'll take that as a yes.

34:31.853 --> 34:35.572
It was that ale that infected you,
not us.

34:36.572 --> 34:38.571
Think about it.

34:38.771 --> 34:41.570
When did your crew start
getting sick?

34:41.770 --> 34:43.969
Was it right after the raid?

34:44.168 --> 34:47.328
After you celebrated your victory?

34:48.047 --> 34:50.088
- This is a trick.
- Is it?

34:50.368 --> 34:51.847
How do you feel?

34:52.047 --> 34:55.485
Better or worse since the injection?

34:58.285 --> 35:03.443
We can make enough of this for your
entire crew, if it's not too late.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.560
What if this isn't a trick?

35:12.800 --> 35:15.160
What if we're telling you the truth?

35:15.840 --> 35:18.838
You'd be letting your crew die
a very dishonourable death

35:19.318 --> 35:21.598
when you could have saved them.

35:23.117 --> 35:24.837
Can you live with that?

35:31.634 --> 35:33.154
One thousand metres.

35:33.434 --> 35:34.914
Two thousand.

35:35.114 --> 35:36.392
Three thousand.

35:39.872 --> 35:41.872
No effect. We're still sinking.

35:42.152 --> 35:44.591
The shock wave dissipated
before it reached us.

35:44.791 --> 35:47.630
We'll need to detonate one closer
next time.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.149
The ship's hull is under enough
pressure already.

35:50.349 --> 35:53.268
- If you detonate a torpedo too close...
- And if I don't?

35:53.468 --> 35:55.387
We need to generate
a large enough shock wave

35:55.587 --> 35:57.026
to push us into a higher orbit.

35:57.226 --> 36:00.825
To do that, the blast has to be big,
and it has to be close.

36:03.745 --> 36:07.144
You heard the sub-commander.
Load two this time.

36:11.583 --> 36:13.861
Sensor resolution's dropping off.

36:14.141 --> 36:15.421
This was your plan?

36:15.661 --> 36:19.020
To grope in the darkness and hope
to stumble across my ship?

36:19.260 --> 36:21.618
That's how we found it the first time.

36:23.578 --> 36:25.457
What was that?

36:26.377 --> 36:29.058
- Weapons fire.
- Where?

36:29.258 --> 36:33.935
Bearing 297 mark 261,
down about two kilometres.

36:34.215 --> 36:35.455
Did it work?

36:35.655 --> 36:37.375
We've moved up,
but only 200 metres.

36:37.575 --> 36:39.534
That's all?

36:41.493 --> 36:43.652
A compartment just collapsed.
Deck 3, Green Sector.

36:43.892 --> 36:45.772
This whole damn ship's
coming apart.

36:45.972 --> 36:48.171
- How many torpedoes we have left?
- Six.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.850
- Load two more.
- It won't be enough.

36:50.050 --> 36:51.889
- Load the weapons.
- We tried. It didn't work.

36:52.089 --> 36:53.890
- Ensign.
- She's right.

36:54.090 --> 36:55.369
We'll never reach a safe altitude

36:55.609 --> 36:58.288
climbing a few hundred metres
at a time.

36:58.568 --> 37:01.447
The longer we stand around arguing,
the more ground we lose.

37:02.727 --> 37:04.606
Fire them all.

37:04.806 --> 37:08.404
What if we detonated
all the torpedoes at once?

37:08.924 --> 37:12.563
We may gain enough altitude,
but I doubt we'd make it in one piece.

37:12.843 --> 37:15.961
I don't know about you,
but I'm willing to take the chance.

37:16.681 --> 37:18.842
We'll detonate at 800 metres.

37:19.162 --> 37:21.921
I was thinking more like 500.

37:22.201 --> 37:24.759
Look, I didn't come all this way
to get crushed in the atmosphere

37:24.999 --> 37:27.279
of some anonymous gas giant.

37:29.198 --> 37:31.318
Loading ports one through six.

37:31.518 --> 37:33.437
Brace yourselves.

37:35.916 --> 37:37.595
Torpedoes armed.

37:44.474 --> 37:46.553
What is it?

37:46.753 --> 37:48.473
Another explosion.

37:48.673 --> 37:51.392
There's a shock wave this time.
Hang on.

38:11.345 --> 38:13.904
- T'Pol.
- What have you been shooting at?

38:14.104 --> 38:17.344
We used the shock waves to gain
some altitude, but it's only temporary.

38:17.584 --> 38:18.783
We'll start sinking again

38:18.982 --> 38:21.262
unless we come up with a way
to get this ship out of here.

38:21.702 --> 38:25.181
I brought someone who should
be able to help do just that.

38:25.381 --> 38:27.380
We're docking now.

38:40.056 --> 38:42.816
I believe you've all met
Officer Bu'kaH.

38:45.935 --> 38:47.453
What's the status of their engines?

38:47.613 --> 38:50.093
The Klingon crew made most
of the necessary repairs

38:50.333 --> 38:52.052
before they were overcome.

38:52.292 --> 38:54.972
But the port fusion injector
is still damaged.

38:55.730 --> 38:58.331
I will tend to my own ship.

38:59.211 --> 39:02.250
I didn't bring you down here just so
you could die with your shipmates.

39:02.490 --> 39:05.928
My crew risked their lives
to get this ship out of danger.

39:06.688 --> 39:09.447
I don't intend to leave
until the job is finished.

39:14.605 --> 39:17.804
Sir, there are two ships approaching
at high warp.

39:18.044 --> 39:19.764
I think they're Klingon.

39:20.004 --> 39:21.843
How long till they get here?

39:22.083 --> 39:24.643
Sixteen minutes.

39:24.882 --> 39:27.362
We're being hailed.
It's the captain.

39:27.522 --> 39:28.962
On screen.

39:29.241 --> 39:33.399
This is Klingon Raptor Somraw
hailing Enterprise.

39:34.439 --> 39:37.718
Request permission to disembark
four passengers.

39:40.597 --> 39:42.836
Well, I don't see why not.

39:50.074 --> 39:53.274
- I kept your seat warm for you.
- Thanks.

39:53.754 --> 39:55.313
Get ready to break orbit, Travis.

39:55.513 --> 39:57.513
I think we've had about enough
of this place.

39:57.713 --> 39:59.831
Aye, captain.

40:00.871 --> 40:04.030
It's the Raptor, sir.
They're hailing us.

40:04.270 --> 40:07.868
- Calling to say thanks?
- I doubt it.

40:08.068 --> 40:10.068
Put it through.

40:11.107 --> 40:14.788
- What can I do for you?
- Prepare to surrender your vessel.

40:15.027 --> 40:16.666
Maybe your engineer neglected
to tell you,

40:16.866 --> 40:20.105
but we just saved you
and your crew.

40:20.345 --> 40:23.544
You violated our ship,
accessed our weapons.

40:23.784 --> 40:26.663
It was either that or stand by
and watch you get crushed.

40:27.303 --> 40:30.822
- Disruptors.
- They're charging weapons.

40:36.059 --> 40:39.340
You wouldn't last ten seconds
in a battle with us.

40:39.540 --> 40:42.099
You've got multiple hull breaches.
Your shields are down.

40:42.339 --> 40:44.937
And from what I'm told,
you're fresh out of torpedoes.

40:45.177 --> 40:49.616
If I were you, I'd take what little honour
I had left and go home.

40:52.734 --> 40:58.173
Fire one shot, and I'll blast you
right back to where we found you.

41:03.492 --> 41:05.371
They're moving off.

41:07.331 --> 41:10.489
Get us out of here
before their friends show up.

41:31.363 --> 41:35.482
- Is someone gonna get that?
- You're closer.

41:47.477 --> 41:49.877
- T'Pol.
- This is Dr Phlox.

41:50.037 --> 41:53.156
You'll be happy to know that you're
now free of any microbes or parasites.

41:53.437 --> 41:57.035
Your captivity in Decon is over.

41:57.675 --> 41:59.155
Are you sure, doctor?

41:59.434 --> 42:01.434
Who knows what was living
on that ship?

42:01.634 --> 42:04.593
What if we picked up something
your scans can't detect?

42:04.712 --> 42:09.071
Well, I'm quite sure you didn't.
I've run every possible test.

42:17.548 --> 42:19.189
Maybe you should run them again,
doctor.

42:19.389 --> 42:23.187
I believe I'm developing
a slight headache.

42:23.787 --> 42:27.466
Of course, if you insist.
I wouldn't want to miss anything.

42:27.706 --> 42:29.625
Thank you, doctor.

42:36.703 --> 42:40.102
That should buy us at least
another half an hour.

42:40.742 --> 42:43.861
Oh, I could stay in here all day.

42:45.300 --> 42:49.659
Went to a spa once in Mexico.

42:49.858 --> 42:52.698
The most relaxing place
I've ever been.

42:52.898 --> 42:55.537
But it doesn't compare to this.

42:56.617 --> 43:00.455
Oh, it certainly feels nice
to be clean again.

43:00.895 --> 43:03.454
It is pleasant.

43:07.573 --> 43:09.573
Do you smell that?

43:12.372 --> 43:16.131
- I don't smell anything.
- Exactly.
