00:01.806 --> 00:04.779
Sean was not a perfect husband.
I was not a perfect wife.

00:04.804 --> 00:06.047
Do you love him?

00:06.616 --> 00:07.710
No.

00:07.742 --> 00:09.577
But you had to think about it.

00:09.636 --> 00:11.844
We found Sean's plane
thousands of miles away

to have disappeared.

you get what you want

00:16.689 --> 00:18.016

00:18.041 --> 00:19.680
Don't you want to know where your dad is?

00:19.705 --> 00:21.836
He's experiencing some kind of memory loss.

00:21.861 --> 00:23.805

they represent a place?

00:23.830 --> 00:25.055
I don't know until I get there.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.625
- What happens when you do?
- Nothing good.

out of that facility.

Why would anyone want to
undo a nuclear meltdown?

Not undo, sir... contain.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.250
Imagine this possibility.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.945
Somehow, through technology
we're not yet familiar with,

01:51.945 --> 01:55.145
you're able to contain...
trap, if you will...

01:55.170 --> 01:57.181
the energy of that meltdown.

01:57.292 --> 01:59.628
We're talking the equivalent
of four Hiroshimas.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.985
To be used without the
launch of a nuclear device.

02:03.010 --> 02:05.137

02:05.162 --> 02:07.865
Frommer: We need to know who's behind this,

02:07.890 --> 02:10.158

02:10.774 --> 02:12.432
There's only one man

02:12.457 --> 02:14.426
who can answer all of our questions.

02:16.632 --> 02:20.632
Sean Bennigan was there
on someone's direct orders.

02:48.199 --> 02:50.572
Mrs. Bennigan, we ran a
thorough series of tests

02:50.604 --> 02:52.739
on you and your son.

02:53.005 --> 02:56.606
There is absolutely no evidence
of any radiation exposure.

02:57.005 --> 02:59.205
You should both be dead
right now. Instead...

02:59.230 --> 03:01.426
Instead, my son is hearing again,

03:01.583 --> 03:04.643
which we were told was not possible.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.420
So how is all this happening?

03:07.420 --> 03:08.788
I don't know.

03:08.788 --> 03:10.490
But we're looking at a miracle.

03:10.584 --> 03:13.075
Sorry, Doctor.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.781
I don't believe in miracles.

03:15.806 --> 03:17.880
Henry: Mommy?

03:22.250 --> 03:24.753
Hi.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.692
Mommy, are we dying?

03:30.410 --> 03:31.745
No.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.414
We are okay.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.000
Henry, what you did,

03:36.025 --> 03:39.629
- going into that place, that...
- Drill told me to trust him.

03:39.819 --> 03:42.822
He said it would be
okay, and... He was right.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.457
Drill...

03:44.457 --> 03:46.196
You can't see him, can you?

03:46.221 --> 03:49.671
No, he's just in my head.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.909
And he helped you get into the reactor?

03:51.934 --> 03:53.397
He said it was a game.

03:53.422 --> 03:55.310
He said I would get a prize if I won,

03:55.335 --> 03:56.770
and I did.

03:57.828 --> 03:59.730
I found daddy.

04:03.543 --> 04:05.712
Do you know how he made
the explosion go away?

04:05.712 --> 04:06.896
I don't know.

04:06.921 --> 04:09.323
I guess the same way he
gave me back my hearing.

04:09.605 --> 04:11.252
How is that?

04:11.883 --> 04:13.760

04:32.406 --> 04:36.402
having all the answers is coming up short.

04:36.427 --> 04:39.033
That's because he's not
asking the right questions.

- How did you gain entry into the nuclear power plant?

04:59.355 --> 05:00.934

This whole amnesia thing, it's very smart.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.876
You think I'm faking it?

05:11.878 --> 05:14.142
Why would I fake something like this?

05:14.167 --> 05:15.402
Because maybe there are some things

05:15.427 --> 05:16.902
you don't want to come home to.

how we know each other?

Did you choose them just to punish us?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.796
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:29.796 --> 05:31.264
I saved that boy.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.399
If it wasn't for me, he'd
have been washed away.

05:32.399 --> 05:33.679
If it wasn't for you, that meltdown

05:33.704 --> 05:35.239
would never have happened, Sean.

05:35.264 --> 05:38.598
- Are you saying I caused a meltdown?
- When you sealed off the pipe,

05:38.612 --> 05:41.000
you blocked the water
from cooling the reactor.

05:41.025 --> 05:43.890
- No, that's not...
- Sean, who's Drill? Is it a person?

05:43.915 --> 05:46.093
A government organization?
Are they state-sponsored?

05:46.119 --> 05:47.563
- I don't...
- Who are they, Sean?

05:47.588 --> 05:48.726
I don't know.

05:48.751 --> 05:50.867
How many times do I have
to say it? I don't know.

Okay.

05:57.303 --> 05:59.070
Look at me.

06:00.201 --> 06:02.371
I have nothing.

No memories...

No past...

06:09.919 --> 06:11.971
Barely a present.

06:13.244 --> 06:15.871
And the future?

06:16.444 --> 06:18.249
The mere notion of a future

06:18.274 --> 06:20.531

Okay.

06:38.548 --> 06:40.683
Okay, Sean.

06:40.708 --> 06:42.985
Why don't you tell me what you do remember?

06:43.010 --> 06:44.946
The first thing I remember is the pain.

06:44.971 --> 06:49.017
I had just woken up...
somewhere in the desert.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.278

06:55.315 --> 06:57.617
Now, I don't how long it had been there

06:57.617 --> 06:59.696
or how long I had been there, but I knew...

06:59.721 --> 07:02.119
I knew that if I didn't get this thing

07:02.144 --> 07:04.954
out of me, that I was gonna die.

07:04.995 --> 07:07.053
So I had a choice to make.

07:07.397 --> 07:10.954
Give up, die with no name,

07:11.076 --> 07:13.053
or take it upon myself to live...

to stay here and stop it.

What's happening at the office?

12:53.354 --> 12:55.517
- You know I can't talk...
- Oh, come on. You're kidding me?

12:55.542 --> 12:56.469
Come on, Bennigan.

12:56.494 --> 12:57.915
You know you can't stay on this case.

12:57.940 --> 12:59.074
[Sighs]

12:59.212 --> 13:02.516
They sent me here to collect your files.

13:02.913 --> 13:05.882
And you get a new partner.

13:05.907 --> 13:08.588
Hey, I didn't ask for this.

13:08.885 --> 13:11.888
I heard what you did.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.200
Buying me time in the
reactor to get to Henry.

13:15.225 --> 13:17.728
Not according to my report.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.901
Thank you.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.739
I'll get you those files.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.076
Just keep me in the loop.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.647
He's my husband, Jessup.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.916
Have you seen him yet?

13:36.941 --> 13:38.556
D.O.D. hasn't cleared me.

13:38.581 --> 13:40.119
Well, you have a pretty good

13:40.144 --> 13:41.228
friend there, don't you?

13:41.253 --> 13:43.427
I'm sure it can be arranged.

13:43.452 --> 13:46.427
Okay.

13:58.614 --> 14:01.316
What?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.210
What is it?

14:03.210 --> 14:04.511
[Sighs]

14:04.511 --> 14:08.215
Just thinking about how my wish came true.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.850
Yeah, what did you wish for?

14:09.850 --> 14:13.850
For Drill to make you and
daddy love each other again.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.794
Just let me know if you need anything.

14:20.794 --> 14:22.404
There you are.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.765
I told Mrs. Bennigan
you'd be here any minute.

14:24.765 --> 14:26.767
Thanks, Renee.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.532
No, leave it open.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.679
I need to see him.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.081
He's still being debriefed.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.882
There are a lot of unanswered questions.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.151
Yes, I know, Wes, but...

14:45.323 --> 14:47.325
But what?

14:48.422 --> 14:51.392
Drill.

14:51.392 --> 14:54.295
I don't think we're dealing with a "who."

14:54.695 --> 14:57.597
I think we're dealing with a "what."

14:57.597 --> 14:59.800
It's the only way it makes sense.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.195
Henry says that he... he can't see Drill,

15:04.220 --> 15:06.781
he just hears him in his
head. How else can you explain

15:06.806 --> 15:08.367
an invisible friend that makes our kids

15:08.392 --> 15:09.962
do things that...

15:10.152 --> 15:12.662
They would never do on their own?

15:13.112 --> 15:14.844
So, then, what is it?

15:14.869 --> 15:16.704
I'm not sure yet,

15:16.729 --> 15:19.298
but that's why I have to talk to Sean.

15:19.323 --> 15:20.825
Claire, he's not the same person.

15:20.850 --> 15:22.285
He is.

15:22.310 --> 15:25.880
He's just forgotten.

15:31.832 --> 15:35.469
You're not just some FBI agent, are you?

15:39.039 --> 15:41.708
My name is Claire Bennigan.

15:42.106 --> 15:44.675
I'm your wife.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.919
You don't remember anything...

15:52.919 --> 15:54.921
About us?

15:58.890 --> 16:02.260
I brought something...

16:02.385 --> 16:04.721
That...

16:04.746 --> 16:07.228
Maybe can help.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.766
We look happy.

16:41.693 --> 16:44.830
Were we?

16:47.307 --> 16:50.010
We were married.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.803
I know you're in there, Sean...

17:16.803 --> 17:19.672
Somewhere.

17:23.204 --> 17:25.853
Sir, we've been going over the readings

17:25.877 --> 17:26.977
from Bennigan's polygraph.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.337
What does it show us?

17:28.362 --> 17:29.977
That's just it.

17:30.618 --> 17:32.120
We're not sure.

17:32.145 --> 17:33.153
What's happening here?

17:33.178 --> 17:34.678
Looks like a malfunction, right?

17:34.703 --> 17:36.405
But the machine, the recording equipment,

17:36.430 --> 17:38.916
- they all check out.
- It makes no sense.

17:49.002 --> 17:51.704
What is it, sir?

17:57.377 --> 18:00.413
It's exactly the same.

18:10.417 --> 18:12.345
How did we meet?

18:12.370 --> 18:13.938
My father.

18:15.206 --> 18:17.018
He set us up.

18:17.043 --> 18:20.617
He'd drove his car into a ditch

18:20.642 --> 18:24.218
trying to avoid... hitting a deer,

18:24.243 --> 18:26.917
and it was dark out.

18:26.942 --> 18:30.279
His phone wasn't getting
any service, and...

18:30.304 --> 18:32.973
Just when he thought he
would have to spend the night

18:32.998 --> 18:36.168
sleeping in his car...

18:36.193 --> 18:39.066
There you were.

18:40.187 --> 18:44.187
On leave from training, in your uniform.

18:44.212 --> 18:46.266
He said you looked like some...

18:46.603 --> 18:48.939
Damn superhero.

18:51.427 --> 18:52.862
Mm.

18:53.068 --> 18:55.904
He had you over to the house

18:55.929 --> 18:57.449
for dinner later that week.

18:57.474 --> 18:58.996
I knew...

18:59.074 --> 19:03.074
I knew exactly what he was doing.

19:03.445 --> 19:06.790
And I was determined to hate you.

19:06.815 --> 19:09.184
- But you didn't.
- No, I did.

19:09.209 --> 19:11.552
[Chuckling] I did...

19:11.591 --> 19:14.427
At first.

19:14.730 --> 19:18.300
I never saw myself as a military wife.

19:18.426 --> 19:22.230
But I swept you off your feet.

19:22.401 --> 19:25.070
Yeah.

19:26.488 --> 19:29.158
Yeah, something like that.

19:34.766 --> 19:38.070
I like that story.

19:38.195 --> 19:40.430
I sound like a good guy.

19:40.455 --> 19:42.991
You are, Sean.

20:02.964 --> 20:07.172
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

20:18.453 --> 20:21.023
[Children shouting]

20:21.546 --> 20:24.048
Man: Welcome to the fun sphere.

20:24.073 --> 20:26.068
Let's celebrate Jenny's birthday!

20:26.093 --> 20:29.197
[Shouting continues]

20:29.197 --> 20:31.799
[Up-tempo music plays]

20:37.820 --> 20:41.123
How can such little people
create so much noise?

20:41.148 --> 20:43.053
[Chuckles]

20:43.593 --> 20:45.500
Oh, Minx looks like she's having fun.

20:45.525 --> 20:46.884
Yeah.

20:46.909 --> 20:47.955
Yeah, unfortunately,

20:47.980 --> 20:50.015
I don't think we've solved our problem.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.228
Thank you for recommending Dr. Rosen.

20:52.253 --> 20:55.289
Wait. You didn't hear?

20:55.289 --> 20:56.502
Hear what?

20:56.527 --> 20:58.763
He was killed the other night.

20:58.788 --> 21:01.157
Apparently some kind of freak accident.

21:01.569 --> 21:04.342
I don't know all the details,
but something about a kid

21:04.367 --> 21:06.903
jumping out in front of him
just right on the street.

21:06.928 --> 21:09.697
Dr. Rosen's bike slammed into a car.

21:09.722 --> 21:11.187
A little kid?

21:11.212 --> 21:12.988
Came out of nowhere.

21:15.248 --> 21:18.852
Wait, d-d-did you see where she went?

21:21.582 --> 21:23.759
Heather, where's Minx?

21:23.784 --> 21:25.095
I don't know.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.689
She said she needed to talk to a friend.

21:27.714 --> 21:30.215
[Whispering]

21:44.606 --> 21:46.674
It's got to be a coincidence.

21:46.861 --> 21:49.099
You think that's a coincidence?

21:49.123 --> 21:50.959
Well, I just...

21:51.546 --> 21:54.015
- The machine clearly malfunctioned.
- And what if it didn't?

21:54.190 --> 21:56.292
Sorry. I'm not following, sir.

21:56.317 --> 21:58.572
Sean Bennigan's subconscious.

21:58.688 --> 22:01.558
I mean, what if the machine

22:01.583 --> 22:03.199
was picking up something there?

22:03.224 --> 22:04.325
That's not how this works.

22:04.350 --> 22:08.583
I understand that, but...
so far, everything about

22:08.608 --> 22:11.512
this entire operation has not
gone the way it was planned.

22:11.537 --> 22:13.239
We need to start looking
at everything differently.

22:13.264 --> 22:15.211
[Telephone rings]

22:15.236 --> 22:17.137
Renee: Hello?

22:18.250 --> 22:20.182
Honey, I think the problem with the volcano

22:20.207 --> 22:21.937
is what's underneath.

22:21.962 --> 22:24.083
[Chuckles] Well, your friend's right.

22:24.108 --> 22:26.142
It's the heat underneath the volcano

22:26.167 --> 22:28.403
that causes the eruption.

22:28.428 --> 22:30.607
That's what pushes the lava up.

22:35.966 --> 22:39.074
I'll stop on my way home
and get a bigger battery.

22:39.227 --> 22:40.628
It's underneath.

22:41.181 --> 22:42.883
What?

22:42.908 --> 22:46.908
Like lava formations... they're caused

22:46.934 --> 22:50.277
by the volcano erupting
from the heat underneath.

22:50.302 --> 22:53.809
The... the fulgurite. It's caused by heat.

22:53.908 --> 22:57.578
It's not the crash site that's important.

22:57.578 --> 22:59.277
It's what's underneath it.

22:59.302 --> 23:02.387
- [Children shouting]
- Minx?

23:15.905 --> 23:18.541
Minx, stop it! Stop talking to him!

23:18.566 --> 23:22.070
What are you doing? You're embarrassing me.

23:26.436 --> 23:28.296
[Cellphone ringing]

23:29.755 --> 23:31.457
[Beep]

23:31.482 --> 23:32.616
Wes.

23:32.764 --> 23:34.633
I have to go back.

23:34.658 --> 23:36.008
What? Where?

23:36.033 --> 23:37.367
Mali.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.594
To the desert, back where it all started.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.226
You're leaving us?

23:41.251 --> 23:42.437
I have to.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.745
The answers that we need,
they're... they're there.

23:44.770 --> 23:45.804
I know it.

23:45.829 --> 23:48.532
Wes...

23:48.966 --> 23:52.224
Lena, are you... All right?

23:52.249 --> 23:54.033
Did something happen?

23:55.700 --> 23:58.533
No. Nothing's wrong.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.028
Just, um, be safe, okay?

24:02.053 --> 24:03.552
I love you.

24:04.414 --> 24:06.853
I love you, too.

24:10.210 --> 24:13.127
You want to know what happened?

24:20.481 --> 24:22.316
This was the first one.

24:22.496 --> 24:25.032
As I was waiting in a cave,

24:25.057 --> 24:26.680
not sure if I was gonna make it,

24:26.705 --> 24:28.299
I kept seeing this image,

24:28.654 --> 24:32.157
and I knew that it was important,

24:32.182 --> 24:34.557
and I couldn't forget.

24:38.554 --> 24:40.923
After that, more images kept coming.

24:40.948 --> 24:44.285
Some of them... told me things.

24:44.285 --> 24:47.154
Some of them... brought me places.

24:49.929 --> 24:51.964
These visions,

24:51.989 --> 24:55.287
you said that they led you to places.

24:55.586 --> 24:56.867
Seville.

24:56.892 --> 24:58.513
There was a train accident,

24:58.538 --> 25:03.265
some strange power outage, two people dead.

25:04.142 --> 25:06.144
I couldn't save them.

25:06.169 --> 25:07.021
Sean.

25:07.046 --> 25:09.943
I had to... I-I had to keep going, though.

25:10.443 --> 25:14.208
A dam in Bordeaux... more casualties.

25:14.482 --> 25:16.451
And that's when I knew.

25:16.572 --> 25:18.073
These visions,

25:18.098 --> 25:20.161
they were giving me a
roadmap to destruction.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.283
And for some reason, I was
being asked to follow it.

25:27.035 --> 25:29.704
And then...

25:30.398 --> 25:32.929
Harper's tree house.

25:41.376 --> 25:43.397
Nuclear plant.

25:45.104 --> 25:46.998
A blackout.

25:47.085 --> 25:50.359
A dam. A nuclear reactor.

25:50.594 --> 25:52.145
All things...

25:52.170 --> 25:54.072
Related to an energy source.

25:54.889 --> 25:57.391
Energy.

26:01.291 --> 26:03.660
What is that, that one?

26:03.685 --> 26:05.130
"A.S. 33"?

26:05.155 --> 26:06.175
I don't know.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.403
I haven't solved that one yet.

26:12.243 --> 26:14.821
Arsenic... atomic number 33,

26:14.846 --> 26:16.548
the only tattoo on Sean's body

26:16.573 --> 26:18.087
that he hasn't been able to solve.

26:18.112 --> 26:19.280
And all the other ones?

26:19.280 --> 26:22.283
Have led to some kind of disaster.

26:22.283 --> 26:23.918
A.S. 33.

26:23.918 --> 26:26.685
So, we're talking about a mass poisoning?

26:26.710 --> 26:27.797
Worse.

26:27.822 --> 26:30.091
You dose a nuclear weapon
with arsenic, and you get...

26:30.116 --> 26:31.093
A salted bomb.

26:31.118 --> 26:33.351
Larger radioactive
fallout, longer half-life.

26:33.794 --> 26:36.405
The reactor wasn't the end game.

26:36.632 --> 26:40.697
It was just the beginning.

26:49.685 --> 26:52.187
No sign of any arsenic?

26:52.212 --> 26:54.556
No missing inventory from
any medical or research labs.

26:54.581 --> 26:56.510
I'll move on to chemical warehouses.

26:56.535 --> 26:58.604
I'm getting nada from the universities.

26:58.629 --> 26:59.809
You're sure?

27:00.256 --> 27:01.291
Nothing.

27:01.430 --> 27:03.031
Well, there's got to be.

27:03.056 --> 27:07.309
Expand the search beyond U.S. borders.

27:08.529 --> 27:10.309

27:10.490 --> 27:12.710
Do it.

27:13.542 --> 27:16.687
Lena: I shouldn't have taken her

27:16.712 --> 27:18.246
to that party today.

27:18.271 --> 27:20.849
With everything that's
going on, it was too much.

27:20.874 --> 27:23.726
You thought she was missing, you panicked.

27:23.751 --> 27:25.252
I would have done the same thing.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.311
Well, that's just it, I
didn't think she was missing.

27:27.336 --> 27:28.837
I thought she was...

27:28.862 --> 27:31.125
You thought she was what?

27:32.819 --> 27:35.755
She and Noah had a playdate last week.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.827
Did he mention anything about her?

27:37.852 --> 27:40.132
No. Why?

27:40.157 --> 27:43.277
What about the other moms?
I know they like to gossip.

27:43.302 --> 27:46.350
Lena, talk to me.

27:50.946 --> 27:53.890
She's changing, Callie.

27:53.915 --> 27:56.667
Minx... she's talking back,

27:56.710 --> 28:00.047
sneaking out of the
house, doing things that...

28:02.190 --> 28:04.693
What if she's turning
into one of those kids?

28:04.718 --> 28:06.920
You know, the ones we whisper about,

28:06.945 --> 28:10.249
the ones you make up excuses
to keep your kid away from.

28:14.345 --> 28:16.981
Do you remember why I asked
for that therapist's number?

28:17.006 --> 28:19.008
The imaginary-friend thing.

28:19.253 --> 28:21.876
Well, it turns out he isn't so imaginary.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.547
What? Have you met this friend?

28:24.572 --> 28:28.049
Not yet. It's complicated.

28:28.074 --> 28:28.855
Look, Lena,

28:28.880 --> 28:30.882
when it comes to protecting your family,

28:30.984 --> 28:33.577
there's no such thing as "complicated."

28:34.232 --> 28:35.978
You do what you have to do.

28:38.754 --> 28:41.286
Sorry, Claire, but without
any concrete results...

28:41.311 --> 28:43.313
Well, I know. It's just...

28:43.338 --> 28:45.106
- I really thought...
- We'll keep digging.

28:45.131 --> 28:47.500
I'll let you know if anything pops up.

28:51.565 --> 28:54.401
[Birds chirping]

29:07.014 --> 29:09.563
Oh, my God.

29:15.322 --> 29:17.689
"A's."

29:36.773 --> 29:39.515
Man: There's the thermal imagery.

29:39.540 --> 29:40.890
As you can see, there's nothing underneath.

29:40.915 --> 29:43.867
We've used gravity
meters and magnetometers.

29:43.891 --> 29:45.538
There's no evidence there's anything more

29:45.563 --> 29:46.624
to the site than what's visible.

29:46.649 --> 29:48.757
But there's no way to be
absolutely sure until we dig.

29:48.782 --> 29:50.380
Digging takes money and equipment.

29:50.405 --> 29:52.577
Given the information that
we have, there's no rush.

29:52.602 --> 29:53.874
We need time to evaluate the surface...

29:53.899 --> 29:55.033
I don't think you understand.

29:55.570 --> 29:59.407
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

30:00.142 --> 30:03.021
Tangara: You will get
your request, Mr. Lawrence,

30:03.046 --> 30:07.770
but... Whatever it is you expect to find...

30:08.471 --> 30:10.770
You may study...

30:10.795 --> 30:14.371
But you may not remove.

30:19.906 --> 30:25.493
It belongs to my country, not yours.

31:00.603 --> 31:02.572
Claire: I need to talk to Ethan.

31:02.597 --> 31:03.991
It's important.

31:04.241 --> 31:06.420
I don't know. I... I
need to ask his mother.

31:06.445 --> 31:07.535
So call her.

31:07.535 --> 31:08.359
Now.

31:08.384 --> 31:10.118
But in the meantime, I
need to prevent an attack

31:10.143 --> 31:12.195
that's about to happen on U.S. soil.

31:12.873 --> 31:14.897
So where is he?

31:21.984 --> 31:23.852
[Indistinct shouting in distance]

31:49.010 --> 31:51.579
Claire: Ethan...

31:52.149 --> 31:55.552
Do you know someone named Drill?

32:00.021 --> 32:03.157
[Sighs] Are you one of his friends?

32:03.407 --> 32:05.910
It's okay.

32:05.935 --> 32:07.126
You can talk to her.

32:07.151 --> 32:10.621
Ethan, what are you building?

32:11.774 --> 32:13.910
It's a volcano.

32:13.935 --> 32:16.938
See, it's a mountain on top,

32:16.938 --> 32:19.340
but there's a battery.

32:19.340 --> 32:22.643
So when I push this, it'll explode.

32:22.643 --> 32:25.254
Can I ask you a question about Drill?

32:25.279 --> 32:27.447
How do you know Drill?

32:27.472 --> 32:29.625
He doesn't like grown-ups.

32:29.650 --> 32:32.620
My son, Henry,

32:32.620 --> 32:35.323
he's a friend of Drill's.

32:35.323 --> 32:36.990
Drill told me there were others.

32:37.015 --> 32:40.352
Did he tell you how many?

32:42.403 --> 32:44.234
Ethan...

32:44.259 --> 32:46.227
[Sighs]

32:46.421 --> 32:48.703
Did Drill ask you to build this?

32:48.736 --> 32:52.519
Yes, he said I needed to make it...

32:52.908 --> 32:56.314
And to call my mom if it didn't work.

32:56.339 --> 32:59.890
I needed to call her at a certain time,

32:59.915 --> 33:03.317
and then she solved it.

33:04.007 --> 33:06.720
I just needed a bigger battery.

33:06.745 --> 33:08.598
I don't want anyone questioning my son

33:08.623 --> 33:11.056
without me present.

33:12.589 --> 33:14.866
Mrs. Bennigan, what are you doing here?

33:15.088 --> 33:17.157
Renee.

33:24.018 --> 33:25.987
Renee...

33:26.012 --> 33:28.481
Where's Wes?

33:55.603 --> 33:57.924
- [Clang]
- [Groans]

33:58.759 --> 34:00.918
[Gasps]

34:02.577 --> 34:04.045
[Grunts]

34:04.647 --> 34:07.203
- [Clanging]
- Stop!

34:07.228 --> 34:09.958
We hit something!

34:13.272 --> 34:16.076
[Indistinct shouting]

34:34.458 --> 34:37.462
[Breathing heavily]

34:37.487 --> 34:40.525
They found it.

34:42.931 --> 34:45.735
[Indistinct conversations]

34:46.150 --> 34:47.935
But it's impossible.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.300
Our scans would have picked it up.

34:49.324 --> 34:50.768
Everyone, please, step back.

34:50.793 --> 34:52.822
Please.

35:06.172 --> 35:08.641
Dig it out.

35:08.909 --> 35:11.387
Claire: Come on, Wes. Pick up.

35:11.724 --> 35:14.514
Damn it.

35:30.944 --> 35:33.914
[Clatter]

35:36.066 --> 35:38.355
[Dog barking in distance]

35:47.446 --> 35:50.184
[Crickets chirping]

36:07.143 --> 36:08.444
[Clang]

36:08.469 --> 36:10.471
[Barking continues]

36:16.330 --> 36:18.840
- [Telephone ringing]
- [Gasps]

36:23.539 --> 36:26.429
[Beep] Hello?

36:26.454 --> 36:27.822
Claire: Lena...

36:28.056 --> 36:31.242
It's Claire Bennigan.

36:31.648 --> 36:35.219
I'm sorry to be calling.
I know... I know this is...

36:35.538 --> 36:38.374
But it's about Wes.

36:38.374 --> 36:40.555
Has he called you?

36:40.580 --> 36:43.249
Why? What's going on?

36:43.274 --> 36:44.942
I know that he's in Africa,

36:44.967 --> 36:46.480
and I've been trying to reach him.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.874
There's another child

36:49.109 --> 36:52.540
being manipulated by Drill,

36:52.939 --> 36:55.908
like Henry and Minx.

36:56.024 --> 36:59.184
I think that it has
something to do with Wes.

36:59.242 --> 37:00.743
What?

37:00.954 --> 37:03.824
I think he's a target.

37:03.824 --> 37:06.846
I think that Drill wanted
Wes to go to Africa.

37:06.969 --> 37:09.004
I haven't been able to reach him,

37:09.029 --> 37:10.479
and neither has Renee,

37:10.504 --> 37:13.941
and I just... I-I thought that...

37:13.966 --> 37:16.969
I thought that you should know,

37:16.994 --> 37:18.713
in case he calls.

37:20.140 --> 37:22.976
Uh, I-if he calls I'll... I'll tell him.

37:22.976 --> 37:24.166
Lena...

37:24.191 --> 37:26.433
Thank you for calling.

37:26.458 --> 37:28.534
[Beep]

37:31.059 --> 37:34.096
Wes, it's me.

37:34.121 --> 37:37.283
If you get this, call me,
please, as soon as you can.

37:37.308 --> 37:38.250
It's important.

37:38.275 --> 37:39.880
[Beep]

37:39.905 --> 37:41.080
[Cellphone thuds]

37:41.105 --> 37:43.749
[Beeping]

38:10.288 --> 38:12.624
Jessup: Looks like she's
in bed for the night.

38:12.945 --> 38:16.248
Frommer: Let me know if that
partner of yours goes anywhere.

38:16.273 --> 38:19.243
Of course. I'll keep you posted.

38:19.268 --> 38:20.996
Thank you, Agent Rollins.

38:21.021 --> 38:23.891
Sir, I wanted to ask you something.

38:23.916 --> 38:28.806
With all due respect,
sir... what's this all about?

38:29.017 --> 38:31.660
Does this have to do with
what happened at the reactor?

38:31.685 --> 38:33.761
Do you think that Agent Bennigan
had something to do with it?

38:33.786 --> 38:35.878
If I thought Claire
Bennigan was responsible,

38:35.904 --> 38:38.126
you'd be doing more than following her.

38:38.151 --> 38:39.352
Then why?

38:39.352 --> 38:41.316
Do you watch the news, Agent Rollins?

38:41.341 --> 38:43.457
I prefer to get mine
from the papers, but...

38:43.482 --> 38:46.034
I hear people say they hate
watching the news on television.

38:46.245 --> 38:49.299
It scares them, seeing all
the madness in the world.

38:49.324 --> 38:51.999
It's not the things I
can see that scare me.

38:52.024 --> 38:55.636
It's the things I can't
see, Agent Rollins...

38:56.265 --> 38:57.903
The unknown.

38:57.928 --> 39:02.403
That's what this is about.

39:08.081 --> 39:10.550
[Warbling]

39:15.062 --> 39:16.618
[Electricity crackling]

39:21.461 --> 39:24.255
[Indistinct shouting]

39:34.261 --> 39:36.230
Up.

39:51.024 --> 39:52.459
Take it.

39:52.459 --> 39:55.619
Whatever it is, it's yours.

39:55.644 --> 39:57.386
Just take it.
