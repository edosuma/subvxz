01:23.574 --> 01:25.209
Do you love her?

01:34.987 --> 01:37.822
I know you do.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.534
It's five kilos
of uncut cocaine.

01:54.339 --> 01:56.540
I'm givin' it to you.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.179
Oh, but
it fuckin' belongs to me.

02:02.514 --> 02:05.450
Because I have something
that belongs to you.

02:23.401 --> 02:25.403
You have 12 fuckin' hours.

03:11.916 --> 03:13.517
That's nice.

03:14.418 --> 03:15.684
Trey...

03:15.686 --> 03:17.187
I'm on vacation.

03:17.422 --> 03:19.654
You're smuggling
drugs into Mexico.

03:19.656 --> 03:22.458
I wouldn't call it
smuggling per se.

03:22.460 --> 03:24.593
What do you think the cops are
gonna call it down here, huh?

03:24.595 --> 03:26.897
I don't know. <i>Gringo loco?</i>
I don't know.

03:26.899 --> 03:28.530
Fuckin' idiot.

03:28.532 --> 03:32.202
Well, we made it through,
so I suggest we smoke it.

03:33.370 --> 03:35.203
- Of course you do.
- Relax, Michael.

03:35.205 --> 03:37.340
It's Mexico, not Switzerland.

04:32.229 --> 04:34.031
No.

05:22.145 --> 05:24.548
Hey. Aren't you going to surf?

05:25.516 --> 05:27.718
The waves too big for you today?

05:41.032 --> 05:43.333
Michael!

05:43.335 --> 05:45.336
Let me go!

05:45.837 --> 05:47.638
Let me go.

06:50.100 --> 06:53.503
Dude, she's so fucking hot!

06:54.239 --> 06:56.741
But are you sure
about this girl?

06:56.808 --> 06:58.342
Honestly?

06:59.643 --> 07:01.812
If she says yes, I'm gonna
settle down with this one.

07:01.845 --> 07:03.413
What?

07:04.280 --> 07:07.949
No way. After just six months?

07:07.951 --> 07:10.787
Michael, are you...
You're kidding, right?

07:12.023 --> 07:15.324
So, I guess you're not coming
to the club tonight.

08:19.590 --> 08:21.324
Door!

08:30.400 --> 08:32.400
- Tony?
- Keep 'em busy!

08:33.438 --> 08:34.471
Move!

08:35.938 --> 08:37.240
<i>Tony.</i>

10:02.226 --> 10:03.860
Let's go!

11:51.569 --> 11:53.404
You look beautiful.

11:53.571 --> 11:55.106
Thank you.

11:57.875 --> 12:00.110
I told you
this place is amazing.

12:01.744 --> 12:03.446
Surreal almost.

12:03.781 --> 12:05.516
There's not a lot
of people around, huh?

12:07.752 --> 12:10.121
See all those luxury hotels?

12:11.154 --> 12:12.723
Unfinished.

12:14.825 --> 12:16.659
Yeah, they overbuilt.

12:16.661 --> 12:18.560
Big time.

12:18.562 --> 12:20.795
Well,
just when the economy tanked,

12:20.797 --> 12:23.665
the president
declared the war on drugs.

12:23.667 --> 12:26.903
The media blew it out of
proportion, tourists got scared.

12:27.404 --> 12:29.172
They stopped building.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.112
I wanna meet your family.

12:35.412 --> 12:37.013
Can I?

12:41.317 --> 12:42.952
Please?

12:44.154 --> 12:46.189
Sure. Let's do it.

12:48.759 --> 12:50.795
Just let me get my
purse from the room.

12:53.297 --> 12:55.064
I'll see you in the lobby.

13:42.647 --> 13:43.945
Do you really think that?

13:43.947 --> 13:45.881
Fuck, no, man.

13:45.883 --> 13:47.882
Dude, we totally lost him
for the night, bro.

13:47.884 --> 13:49.252
Oh!

13:50.553 --> 13:51.988
Yeah!

13:55.659 --> 13:56.891
<i>Hola, Senor.</i>

13:56.893 --> 13:58.993
Hey, <i>andale!</i>

13:58.995 --> 14:00.930
Uh, what do you call
a strip club here again?

14:42.239 --> 14:43.438
Excuse me.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.141
Hi.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.342
Did you by any chance
see a young woman?

14:47.344 --> 14:51.148
She's wearing a pink dress.
She's about 5'7".

14:52.148 --> 14:54.617
No, sir.
I'm sorry. I didn't see.

14:56.387 --> 14:57.486
All right. Thanks.

14:57.488 --> 14:59.122
You're welcome.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.801
Hello.

15:44.534 --> 15:47.670
<i>Go to the hotel entrance. You
have two minutes. Come alone.</i>

16:28.512 --> 16:30.814
Yeah. Hey!

16:31.548 --> 16:32.981
Yeah!

16:32.983 --> 16:34.516
Woo!

16:34.518 --> 16:36.852
- Ay!
- Ooh!

16:36.854 --> 16:38.422
Oh, yeah!

16:39.690 --> 16:41.225
Nice.

16:41.325 --> 16:42.925
What!

16:46.529 --> 16:49.564
I love you!

16:49.566 --> 16:52.335
I love you!

18:17.721 --> 18:20.824
<i>You're gonna deliver it
across the border to San Diego.</i>

18:20.858 --> 18:22.826
If it's lost,

18:23.260 --> 18:27.831
stolen, or you get arrested,
she'll die.

18:29.766 --> 18:32.033
<i>If it's damaged in
any way, she'll die.</i>

18:34.638 --> 18:36.240
<i>Gracias.</i>

18:41.678 --> 18:44.982
<i>If try to go back to your
hotel or contact the police...</i>

18:45.616 --> 18:47.184
<i>We'll know.</i>

18:47.217 --> 18:49.251
<i>Because I'll be watching you.</i>

18:49.253 --> 18:51.789
And I'll slice her
fucking throat myself.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.013
<i>- Destination?
- Tijuana.</i>

19:17.179 --> 19:18.647
Sign here, please.

20:08.197 --> 20:09.933
Are you okay?

20:10.434 --> 20:12.768
- You don't look okay.
- I'm fine.

20:12.770 --> 20:14.371
Wait...

20:17.474 --> 20:19.343
Your eye is bleeding.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.311
Can I?

20:32.423 --> 20:33.856
Excuse me, sir...

20:44.201 --> 20:46.167
That's the best you can do?

20:58.715 --> 21:00.550
Hey, I'm sorry
about your partner.

21:04.187 --> 21:06.689
The streets have ears.

21:16.199 --> 21:18.067
Something bad happened?

21:20.737 --> 21:23.105
Tell me.
What were you doing in Baja?

21:23.674 --> 21:26.276
I just came down
with my friends to surf.

21:27.878 --> 21:29.479
What?

21:30.379 --> 21:32.683
I live a mile from the beach
and I never go.

21:33.283 --> 21:35.151
Maybe I should.

21:35.318 --> 21:37.220
Yeah. You should.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.576
Yep.

23:04.207 --> 23:07.243
Thanks for cleaning me up.

23:24.727 --> 23:27.129
Hey! Stop that girl.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.533
Hey!

26:37.286 --> 26:39.021
She stole my bag.

26:39.490 --> 26:41.024
I want it back.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.532
Get him, <i>ese!</i>

26:50.867 --> 26:53.336
Fuck him! Fuck him up!

26:53.936 --> 26:56.472
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah,
come on!

27:03.013 --> 27:04.347
Yeah!

27:07.717 --> 27:09.018
Fuck him up!

27:24.868 --> 27:26.802
Feed this <i>puto</i> to the dogs.

27:34.377 --> 27:35.912
No, no!

27:56.899 --> 27:59.200
That was one hell of a move
you pulled back there.

27:59.202 --> 28:02.338
But if were me and you, I would
have let that train plow you.

28:04.975 --> 28:07.010
It would cut you right in half.

28:08.344 --> 28:10.512
This doesn't belong to you.

28:11.848 --> 28:14.651
Cartels often wrap their dope
in a specific manner.

28:14.952 --> 28:16.784
It's like their signature.

28:16.786 --> 28:21.990
For example, the Venegas Cartel
wraps their dope like a cocoon.

28:23.694 --> 28:26.996
La Sombra wraps
their dope crisscross.

28:27.830 --> 28:31.800
This is crisscross.
Unbroken seal.

28:35.071 --> 28:37.672
Any one of us tried
to move this dope,

28:37.674 --> 28:39.509
it could start a war.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.610
Or be a death sentence.

28:42.244 --> 28:45.447
Which makes it
less than worthless to me.

28:46.750 --> 28:48.852
In fact it's a liability.

28:49.484 --> 28:51.752
I don't care who it belongs to.

28:51.754 --> 28:53.620
I have to take it
across the border.

28:53.622 --> 28:55.591
<i>Americano bandito.</i>

28:57.359 --> 29:02.030
If you carry dope in Mexico,
you have to be willing to die.

29:04.266 --> 29:06.136
Are you willing to die?

29:10.072 --> 29:11.472
Yes.

29:11.474 --> 29:13.741
And how do you plan on carrying
this across the border?

29:13.743 --> 29:15.845
I'm American. I'll just walk.

29:16.545 --> 29:17.878
Or I'll buy my way across.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.682
Why is it an American's answer
to everything is money?

29:20.684 --> 29:22.485
Hmm?

29:23.853 --> 29:25.655
Listen...

29:26.289 --> 29:28.792
I appreciate what
you did for my niece.

29:29.459 --> 29:30.993
I really do.

29:31.328 --> 29:33.294
But you are going
to have to leave.

29:33.296 --> 29:34.897
Now.

29:35.330 --> 29:36.899
This...

29:38.702 --> 29:40.636
It puts us all at risk.

29:45.109 --> 29:46.742
It's all yours.

29:48.978 --> 29:51.180
Just in case you
need a Plan B...

29:52.815 --> 29:55.415
Here. Mermaid's.

29:55.417 --> 29:57.777
You're going to tell the doorman
that you need to see Pedro.

29:57.853 --> 29:59.753
Anybody ask you who sent you,

29:59.755 --> 30:02.925
you tell them with a straight face,
"None of your fucking business."

30:04.194 --> 30:05.728
<i>Me entiendes?</i>

30:06.362 --> 30:07.963
Okay.

30:09.465 --> 30:10.964
Pull this. He'll understand.

30:10.966 --> 30:13.535
Why'd you help me like this?

30:15.338 --> 30:17.271
Because you saved my niece here,

30:17.273 --> 30:19.406
even after she
tried to jack you.

30:19.408 --> 30:20.944
That takes heart.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.680
Do you know how to use it?

30:26.282 --> 30:29.819
You take this butt and you
slam it on someone's face.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.689
Then all you
have to do is point.

30:36.559 --> 30:40.896
If you travel with drugs in Mexico,
you are going to need this.

30:43.698 --> 30:45.267
Thanks.

30:45.968 --> 30:47.803
The border is that way.

30:48.237 --> 30:51.107
Just look for the metal arch
on Revolucion.

30:52.442 --> 30:55.278
And <i>gringo,</i> be careful.

32:01.578 --> 32:03.912
Michael. Olivia.

32:03.914 --> 32:05.648
Hello?

32:08.752 --> 32:10.318
Should get somebody
to open the door.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.752
There's a guy
there back in the hall.

32:11.754 --> 32:13.856
All right.

32:31.107 --> 32:33.473
<i>You can leave
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

32:33.475 --> 32:35.677
Dude, when you get this,
give me a call.

32:37.879 --> 32:40.215
Yeah, right. Please.

32:43.786 --> 32:45.351
Yo, Michael!

32:45.353 --> 32:47.223
Olivia?

32:55.631 --> 32:57.367
Try him again, dude.

33:00.336 --> 33:02.337
<i>Hi, this is Michael.
I'm not in right now,</i>

33:02.339 --> 33:04.739
<i>but you can leave a message
and I'll call you back.</i>

33:04.741 --> 33:06.574
It's his voicemail again.

33:06.576 --> 33:08.244
Are you kidding me?

33:09.344 --> 33:10.946
Okay.

33:13.882 --> 33:15.915
<i>Rosarita Beach Hotel.</i>

33:15.917 --> 33:21.057
Yeah, hi. Um, I need some help. We're
actually looking for our friends.

35:34.223 --> 35:35.891
<i>Identificacion?</i>

35:45.368 --> 35:47.537
We need to look in the backpack.

36:15.831 --> 36:17.331
Hello?

36:17.333 --> 36:19.035
<i>I see you're making progress.</i>

36:20.335 --> 36:22.370
<i>Next time we speak,
you'll be on the other side.</i>

36:23.739 --> 36:26.008
<i>Don't try anything stupid.</i>

36:26.109 --> 36:28.910
Hey, wait!
I wanna talk to her.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.879
I need to know she's okay.

36:32.114 --> 36:33.915
Hello?

38:05.507 --> 38:08.077
You looking for
something to steal?

38:08.710 --> 38:10.444
I thought I might
try drug running.

38:10.446 --> 38:13.015
But I guess you have
that covered already.

38:15.116 --> 38:17.953
Get in.
I take you to Plan B.

38:21.056 --> 38:22.590
Come on.

38:35.938 --> 38:39.572
Sure you want to ride with me
and these drugs?

38:39.574 --> 38:42.177
I'm not planning on getting caught.
Are you?

38:47.850 --> 38:50.318
I'm sorry about
trying to steal your bag.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.722
You were an easy mark.

38:54.956 --> 38:57.458
No, really. Thank you...

38:57.460 --> 39:00.596
For pulling me off the track.
I owe you my life.

39:13.543 --> 39:15.711
What's the deal
with this guy Pedro?

39:16.712 --> 39:18.613
He's a coyote.

39:19.081 --> 39:20.947
He will help you to
get across, but...

39:20.949 --> 39:22.648
I don't trust him.

39:22.650 --> 39:24.220
Why not?

39:24.953 --> 39:26.688
You have money?

39:28.156 --> 39:29.790
Not much.

39:29.792 --> 39:32.627
You need money. A good
coyote don't come cheap.

39:36.132 --> 39:37.163
Do you want me to come with you?

39:37.165 --> 39:40.135
No. I got this. But thank you.

39:41.136 --> 39:42.804
I still owe you.

39:42.904 --> 39:44.472
We're even.

39:57.319 --> 39:59.085
How can I help you?

39:59.087 --> 40:00.688
I need to see Pedro.

40:01.322 --> 40:03.191
Who sent you?

40:03.525 --> 40:05.594
None of your fuckin' business.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.830
Andres, huh? Get in there.

40:33.255 --> 40:35.191
I'm here to see Pedro.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.095
Go do something.

40:44.067 --> 40:46.635
A gun?

40:47.703 --> 40:50.171
Come on.
Sit down, asshole. Sit down!

40:57.714 --> 40:59.880
So Andres either gave you
that <i>pistolero,</i>

40:59.882 --> 41:02.516
or you're some badass motherfucker,
and you took it from him.

41:02.518 --> 41:05.052
My guess, the former?

41:05.054 --> 41:06.889
He said you could help me.

41:07.790 --> 41:09.558
How so?

41:11.627 --> 41:13.159
I need to get across the border.

41:13.161 --> 41:16.331
Hey, I thought white boys
crossed the border legally.

41:20.103 --> 41:23.472
I suppose it has something to do
with what's in that bag, right?

41:26.342 --> 41:28.808
I have to get across the border.
Are you gonna help me or not?

41:28.810 --> 41:31.279
So, what are you gonna do? Hop
a fence like a goddamn beaner?

41:32.081 --> 41:34.315
'Cause you need a pro
to take you, okay?

41:34.317 --> 41:35.715
It's an hour's drive east,

41:35.717 --> 41:38.050
over the roughest terrain
Mexico has to offer.

41:38.052 --> 41:42.056
You'll be dodgin' criminals,
outlaws, dirty cops, federales,

41:42.058 --> 41:44.498
not to mention the cartel who's
land you'll be trespassing on.

41:44.793 --> 41:48.463
Listen to this,
you don't know where to cross.

41:49.665 --> 41:51.632
I don't give a shit what's in that bag.
All right?

41:51.634 --> 41:53.166
I don't give a shit,
but listen to me.

41:53.168 --> 41:56.671
And know this, You screw over the
wrong motherfucker down here,

41:57.940 --> 42:01.176
they will cut your face off and
staple it to a soccer ball.

42:04.813 --> 42:08.918
I am that wrong motherfucker.
Understand? Understood?

42:09.585 --> 42:12.288
Yeah? Good.

42:12.621 --> 42:14.487
So, how soon do you
need to get there?

42:14.489 --> 42:16.157
- Soon as possible.
- Hours or days?

42:16.159 --> 42:17.724
Hours.

42:17.726 --> 42:19.495
How much money
do you got on you?

42:20.429 --> 42:22.698
Like 500 bucks.

42:23.065 --> 42:24.800
500 bucks?

42:28.170 --> 42:30.238
500 bucks!

42:30.806 --> 42:34.743
You're joking me, right?
You need $10,000.

42:37.112 --> 42:38.512
Now, is it a problem?

42:38.514 --> 42:40.947
'Cause if it is, take your ass
up, get your ass up right now

42:40.949 --> 42:42.949
and walk away
from here right now, okay?

42:42.951 --> 42:46.253
Go to the bank. Get the money.
Don't forget the money.

42:46.255 --> 42:47.987
Bring your ass back here
as fast as you can,

42:47.989 --> 42:50.590
have your sweet ass back on
American soil, late afternoon.

42:50.592 --> 42:52.294
- Deal?
- Okay?

42:52.393 --> 42:53.659
Forgetting somethin'?

42:53.661 --> 42:54.962
Leave the bag.

42:54.964 --> 42:56.832
Well, I'm gonna
need my passport!

42:57.634 --> 42:58.866
Now let's not tell me
what you're going to need.

42:58.868 --> 43:00.400
I'm gonna tell you
what you need? Okay?

43:00.402 --> 43:02.369
I don't give
a fuck about the bag,

43:02.371 --> 43:04.103
the bag's collateral, all right?

43:04.105 --> 43:05.505
It's safer here with me

43:05.507 --> 43:07.875
than it is with your dumb ass
running around out there.

43:07.877 --> 43:09.979
- Get it? Give him his passport.
- Yeah.

43:10.246 --> 43:12.414
Get outta here.

43:13.049 --> 43:16.318
Hurry the fuck up, man. You're
cutting into my ass time.

43:17.520 --> 43:18.921
Rosy, get your ass out here.

44:20.882 --> 44:23.683
- I need a cash advance on all of these. Okay?
- Okay.

44:23.685 --> 44:26.588
Start with this one.
Max out what you can.

44:50.346 --> 44:52.814
<i>Senor</i> Taylor,
is everything all right?

44:52.915 --> 44:54.550
Pardon?

44:55.418 --> 44:58.854
Do you mind to take off
your hat and glasses?

45:10.031 --> 45:13.833
I wonder if this is
some sort of emergency.

45:13.835 --> 45:16.405
No. No, emergency.
Just a rough night.

45:16.839 --> 45:18.771
As you understand,
the interest rates

45:18.773 --> 45:22.509
and fees on cash advances
are very high.

45:22.511 --> 45:27.049
Perhaps I could arrange a wire
transfer from another source?

45:27.516 --> 45:29.651
No. No, that's fine.

45:29.685 --> 45:31.486
Just get me the money, please.

45:31.554 --> 45:32.886
I'm in a hurry.

45:32.888 --> 45:36.425
On cash withdrawals
of more than $10,000,

45:37.726 --> 45:39.391
we'll need you to
fill out some forms.

45:39.393 --> 45:40.460
Yeah.

45:40.462 --> 45:41.561
That's fine.

45:41.563 --> 45:43.065
One moment, please.

46:38.753 --> 46:42.490
Look at him. He can barely fit in
the elevator, let alone a tunnel.

46:42.590 --> 46:44.660
I was just saying, man.

47:08.484 --> 47:10.451
Hey, baby.

47:10.453 --> 47:12.553
He's on his way.

47:12.721 --> 47:14.956
He's paying for the coyote.

47:16.025 --> 47:18.126
I want more this time.

47:21.630 --> 47:23.232
You'll get what we agreed.

47:23.465 --> 47:25.200
Mateo.

47:26.835 --> 47:28.836
I want more.

47:51.127 --> 47:54.427
Hey. Hey, relax, kid. Man.

47:54.429 --> 47:56.896
Come on. This is a gentleman's retreat,
man. It's a place of business.

47:56.898 --> 47:59.001
All right? Be cool. Here.

48:05.339 --> 48:08.276
Hey. My fucking money.
You got the money?

48:10.277 --> 48:12.013
Good.

48:14.683 --> 48:17.483
Hey, you know what? You
better tell my parole officer

48:17.485 --> 48:19.552
that I'm living in Mexico.
I'm a desperado.

48:19.554 --> 48:23.125
I won't be at my three o'clock
on Wednesday, okay?

49:15.744 --> 49:16.977
Hey, Chuy.

49:23.886 --> 49:25.386
Michael Taylor.

49:37.900 --> 49:39.901
Hello?

49:40.802 --> 49:42.771
Have you heard anything?

49:44.607 --> 49:46.308
Okay, well, we'll be up here.

49:47.076 --> 49:48.977
Come on up.

49:49.444 --> 49:51.245
<i>Gracias.</i>

50:04.860 --> 50:07.295
- American?
- Yeah.

50:07.529 --> 50:09.397
My name is Gabriel.

50:09.531 --> 50:11.163
I am from Nicaragua.

50:11.165 --> 50:13.801
- You know Nicaragua?
- I do.

50:14.603 --> 50:15.701
May I ask you a question?

50:15.703 --> 50:17.371
Sure.

50:17.639 --> 50:19.741
What are you doing here?

50:21.110 --> 50:23.576
Just trying to get across.
Same as you.

50:23.578 --> 50:27.181
No, no. Same as you?
No, you're not same as me.

50:27.183 --> 50:30.018
You are American.
You are going home.

50:32.154 --> 50:35.790
I don't want any trouble.
I'm just trying to get across.

50:36.324 --> 50:38.725
Well, perhaps we're the same.

50:55.911 --> 50:57.711
Shit.

51:02.851 --> 51:04.886
- Hi, gentlemen.
- Hello.

51:05.953 --> 51:07.988
Do you recognize this person?

51:12.060 --> 51:14.062
Yeah. That's him.

51:14.196 --> 51:16.397
Yeah, it's Michael Taylor.

52:29.772 --> 52:31.538
How much longer?

52:31.540 --> 52:33.475
Very soon, Michael.

52:35.310 --> 52:37.143
How do you know my name?

52:37.145 --> 52:38.879
Gringo.

52:38.913 --> 52:40.013
Hey!

53:23.424 --> 53:25.724
Please! Please!
Don't hurt me.

53:25.726 --> 53:27.461
Not gonna hurt you.

53:27.730 --> 53:29.598
They were going to kill me.

53:36.203 --> 53:38.205
Let's go.

54:51.779 --> 54:53.112
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

54:53.114 --> 54:54.716
Good luck.

55:19.574 --> 55:23.345
This is crisscross.
Unbroken seal.

55:25.647 --> 55:28.316
Hey. My fucking money.
You got the money?

55:28.817 --> 55:31.516
Hey, you know what? You
better tell my parole officer

55:31.518 --> 55:33.620
that I'm living in Mexico.
I'm a desperado.

55:35.757 --> 55:37.492
Pedro.

55:58.681 --> 56:02.083
Looks like we got a rabbit
on the run here, huh?

56:03.752 --> 56:05.016
I'm American.

56:05.018 --> 56:06.487
We'll see about that.

56:07.154 --> 56:09.557
On your knees, boy. Get down.

56:11.926 --> 56:13.761
Easy now.

56:14.728 --> 56:17.197
- I'm reaching for my passport.
- Okay.

56:20.768 --> 56:22.302
Mmm?

56:22.304 --> 56:24.239
What do you think?

56:26.808 --> 56:28.710
Okay. Get up.

56:30.277 --> 56:31.409
What you doing out here, boy?

56:31.411 --> 56:33.247
It's a long story.

56:34.281 --> 56:36.450
How about making it a short one?

56:36.551 --> 56:38.117
What happened to your face?

56:38.119 --> 56:40.254
You look a little beat up there.

56:40.855 --> 56:42.723
What's in the bag?

56:45.560 --> 56:47.828
I asked you, what's in the bag?

56:48.197 --> 56:49.798
Just my belongings.

56:49.831 --> 56:51.533
Show us.

56:52.232 --> 56:53.967
This is America.
You have no right to...

56:53.969 --> 56:56.067
Show us what's in the bag!

56:56.069 --> 56:57.805
Now.

57:00.775 --> 57:02.544
Thank you.

57:02.677 --> 57:04.546
Open.

57:20.994 --> 57:23.597
You. On the ground. Now.

57:25.299 --> 57:28.169
The passport. Throw it to me.

57:33.308 --> 57:36.310
Now, cuff yourself to him.

57:37.045 --> 57:39.414
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

57:46.453 --> 57:49.156
- Throw me the keys.
- No.

57:59.801 --> 58:01.468
Really?

58:07.042 --> 58:10.178
Hey! Where you going? Hey!

58:10.411 --> 58:12.347
What do you think you're doing?

58:13.181 --> 58:14.915
Hey!

58:34.668 --> 58:36.703
He was just at the border, man.

58:37.071 --> 58:39.005
Now it looks like
he's turning around.

58:39.007 --> 58:40.807
What's going on?

58:44.913 --> 58:47.848
Look. Your fucking boyfriend's
getting cold feet.

58:49.384 --> 58:50.884
I thought he was being followed.

58:50.886 --> 58:53.655
Or maybe his backpack
was stolen, man.

58:54.855 --> 58:57.925
Hey. You're still paying me.
I did my part.

58:58.627 --> 59:00.495
Mateo.

59:01.929 --> 59:04.566
Any time you want to fucking go
back to where I found you...

59:09.136 --> 59:10.972
Could've been jumped.

59:27.956 --> 59:30.121
<i>Is there a problem, my friend?</i>

59:30.123 --> 59:31.858
No. I'm on schedule.

59:31.860 --> 59:33.726
<i>If you don't make
the fucking delivery,</i>

59:33.728 --> 59:35.460
<i>she's not the only
one that's gonna die.</i>

59:35.462 --> 59:39.099
<i>Do you understand me? You have
less than three fucking hours.</i>

01:00:52.139 --> 01:00:53.773
You switched it,
you son of a bitch.

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:54.974
Relax, kid.
Okay, just put the gun down.

01:00:54.976 --> 01:00:56.175
And you tried to
have your men kill me.

01:00:56.177 --> 01:00:57.342
Put the gun down.

01:00:57.344 --> 01:00:58.978
I'm not going out like that.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.213
Okay, that's cool.
What do you want from me?

01:01:01.215 --> 01:01:02.782
I want it back.

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:04.385
Hey, fuck you.
I can't do it, all right?

01:01:07.456 --> 01:01:09.387
Okay.

01:01:09.389 --> 01:01:11.758
Come on, have a beer.

01:01:12.293 --> 01:01:14.893
All right. Just don't
shoot me, all right?

01:01:14.895 --> 01:01:17.397
I like my head.
I don't wanna lose it.

01:01:22.436 --> 01:01:27.408
Hey, look. Look, man. This isn't yours.
It's not yours. It's not...

01:01:27.507 --> 01:01:29.875
Okay. They're gonna
want it back.

01:01:29.877 --> 01:01:32.110
They're gonna want it back and
they're gonna wanna know...

01:01:32.112 --> 01:01:34.380
And they're gonna wanna know
who gave it to you.

01:01:34.382 --> 01:01:36.583
So they're
probably gonna kill me.

01:01:36.585 --> 01:01:38.953
And they're
definitely gonna kill you.

01:01:39.786 --> 01:01:42.122
Look. Look, smart ass.

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:44.725
You can tell them yourself.

01:02:50.123 --> 01:02:51.558
I told you I didn't trust him.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.391
Good call.

01:02:53.393 --> 01:02:56.494
My uncle called Pedro
and sniffed out his bullshit.

01:02:56.496 --> 01:02:59.197
He's going to get a serious
beating for crossing you.

01:02:59.199 --> 01:03:04.137
Andres vouched for you. We don't
take that lightly around here.

01:03:09.944 --> 01:03:12.811
Are you gonna
come clean now? Mmm?

01:03:12.813 --> 01:03:15.114
They kidnapped my girlfriend

01:03:15.116 --> 01:03:18.016
and told me to take these
drugs across the border.

01:03:18.018 --> 01:03:21.054
I've got an hour left
before they kill her.

01:03:22.922 --> 01:03:24.190
Well, how's that funny?

01:03:24.192 --> 01:03:27.227
I wish someone cared
about me that much.

01:03:35.335 --> 01:03:37.203
Listen, I'm running out of time.

01:03:37.205 --> 01:03:40.508
We gonna take a tunnel.
It's simple as that.

01:04:52.346 --> 01:04:55.582
It's gonna be okay.
You'll get her back.

01:04:56.817 --> 01:04:58.618
Where is it?

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.289
You're standing on it.
Move it.

01:05:09.764 --> 01:05:12.033
You're on your own from here.

01:05:12.366 --> 01:05:14.035
Thanks.

01:05:14.235 --> 01:05:16.136
Now we're even.

01:05:21.241 --> 01:05:24.245
You need to go, Michael.
Go. Now! Go!

01:05:29.183 --> 01:05:32.185
Go. Please. Go, Michael!

01:05:32.686 --> 01:05:34.553
Go, go, go.

01:06:19.299 --> 01:06:21.702
Baby, it's all coming together.

01:06:25.806 --> 01:06:28.009
<i>- Salud.
- Salud.</i>

01:06:33.681 --> 01:06:35.982
Hey.

01:07:21.962 --> 01:07:23.796
Mateo.

01:07:27.301 --> 01:07:31.104
The kid is on US soil, man. We need
to get our people in place now.

01:07:35.877 --> 01:07:40.214
Are you sure you can't give me
something extra this time?

01:07:43.016 --> 01:07:46.352
Don't worry.
I'll make it quick.

01:08:33.232 --> 01:08:35.868
Michael Taylor.
I've been looking for you.

01:08:37.304 --> 01:08:39.770
Jesus Valencia, Tijuana Police.

01:08:39.773 --> 01:08:41.809
I know they have Olivia.

01:08:45.779 --> 01:08:47.078
You know who's got her?

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.015
We're close.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:52.852
If we work together,
we can find them.

01:08:56.723 --> 01:08:58.724
No. If I talk to police,
they'll kill her.

01:08:58.725 --> 01:09:00.158
I can help you, Michael.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.528
I can't take that chance.
I'm sorry.

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:07.033
You do this on your own, neither
one of you will survive.

01:09:07.968 --> 01:09:10.270
These guys do not
like loose ends.

01:09:10.504 --> 01:09:14.274
You help me find them,
I'll let you walk.

01:09:18.946 --> 01:09:20.546
Give me the gun.

01:09:23.716 --> 01:09:25.452
I don't have much time.

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:27.854
We don't need much time.

01:09:44.037 --> 01:09:46.037
<i>We set a sting up, on our side.</i>

01:09:46.038 --> 01:09:48.808
<i>Mr. Valencia has Mateo's
residence in T.J.</i>

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:51.475
You tell him the truth, you stay
on the U.S. side of the border

01:09:51.478 --> 01:09:53.545
near the crossing. Don't give him
a chance to ask you questions.

01:09:53.546 --> 01:09:55.413
You ask him about Olivia.
Say, "Is she still alive?"

01:09:55.415 --> 01:09:57.318
Say you want to speak to her.

01:09:58.018 --> 01:10:00.253
He'll probably refuse,
but that's okay.

01:10:01.254 --> 01:10:02.454
When he tells you
where to make the drop,

01:10:02.456 --> 01:10:04.456
you keep it nice and slow.

01:10:04.458 --> 01:10:07.093
He says he needs 30 minutes,
you say you need 45.

01:10:08.362 --> 01:10:10.395
You gotta buy us as much
time as you can, Michael.

01:10:10.397 --> 01:10:12.965
I don't know. He's tracking
the phone, I think.

01:10:12.967 --> 01:10:15.135
He is. Don't worry,
this place doesn't exist.

01:10:27.514 --> 01:10:30.282
Hey, kid. Come on.
Hey, keep it together.

01:10:30.284 --> 01:10:32.586
Hang in there.
Just a bit longer, okay?

01:10:33.152 --> 01:10:34.954
We do this every day.

01:10:36.123 --> 01:10:37.958
You're gonna be okay.

01:10:38.426 --> 01:10:40.261
We have an incoming.

01:10:41.928 --> 01:10:44.296
Fucking idiot.

01:10:44.298 --> 01:10:48.266
So, I backtracked the number
to an address in T.J.

01:10:48.268 --> 01:10:51.372
It's registered to
a Mateo Fuentes and...

01:10:52.072 --> 01:10:54.675
Guess what. He's on our watch list.

01:10:59.847 --> 01:11:01.415
That him?

01:11:05.919 --> 01:11:07.986
Just give me another
minute to split off the trace.

01:11:14.227 --> 01:11:15.827
Hello.

01:11:15.829 --> 01:11:17.563
<i>So you made it?</i>

01:11:17.798 --> 01:11:19.533
I did.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:20.832
Where the fuck are you?

01:11:20.834 --> 01:11:22.568
San Ysidro.

01:11:25.873 --> 01:11:27.473
Very good, my friend.

01:11:27.642 --> 01:11:28.739
<i>You got my shit?</i>

01:11:28.741 --> 01:11:30.410
I have it.

01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:32.446
Okay.

01:11:33.313 --> 01:11:36.150
What about Olivia?
I wanna talk to her.

01:11:37.218 --> 01:11:39.051
<i>You can talk to her after.</i>

01:11:39.053 --> 01:11:41.086
It's what we agreed.

01:11:41.088 --> 01:11:43.021
Tell me what to do.

01:11:43.023 --> 01:11:46.092
<i>Go to Chicano Park,
look for a Lady Guadalupe.</i>

01:11:47.227 --> 01:11:49.296
<i>There'll be a bin
with a red X on it.</i>

01:11:50.063 --> 01:11:52.631
<i>Make the fucking drop inside.</i>

01:11:52.633 --> 01:11:53.998
<i>And get the hell out of there.</i>

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.970
When do I get to see her?

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:58.436
<i>After we verify the product.</i>

01:11:58.438 --> 01:12:00.173
I need more time.

01:12:00.741 --> 01:12:02.140
I'm on foot.

01:12:02.142 --> 01:12:05.646
<i>Take a damn taxi. You have
30 minutes or she's dead.</i>

01:12:07.681 --> 01:12:09.681
- I got him.
- Okay, time to go.

01:12:09.683 --> 01:12:11.951
I'll split the trace.
You're all clear, Jesus.

01:12:11.953 --> 01:12:13.752
We're going to get this guy.

01:12:13.754 --> 01:12:15.887
We're going to bring
back Olivia unharmed.

01:12:15.889 --> 01:12:18.025
I'm going with you.

01:13:11.812 --> 01:13:14.248
<i>The drop will
be made in 30 minutes or less.</i>

01:13:14.748 --> 01:13:17.217
Make sure to check the fucking
bag before you get out.

01:13:21.088 --> 01:13:22.854
<i>As soon as the drop is made,</i>

01:13:22.856 --> 01:13:24.690
kill him.

01:14:05.165 --> 01:14:06.765
Hey, Mateo.

01:14:06.767 --> 01:14:08.500
He just dropped
the bag, but, uh...

01:14:08.502 --> 01:14:10.335
<i>But what?</i>

01:14:10.337 --> 01:14:11.702
He's just standing there, homie.

01:14:11.704 --> 01:14:13.573
He ain't fucking leaving.

01:14:18.445 --> 01:14:20.945
Get my shit, then slice
his fucking throat.

01:14:20.947 --> 01:14:22.913
What? Right here?

01:14:22.915 --> 01:14:25.584
What the fuck did I just tell you?
Just fucking do it!

01:14:27.487 --> 01:14:29.455
Just fucking do it, homie.

01:14:32.593 --> 01:14:35.896
<i>We've got movement.
Wait on my call.</i>

01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:51.378
Hey, white boy.

01:14:52.079 --> 01:14:53.177
Freeze! Freeze!

01:14:53.179 --> 01:14:55.848
Hands on the floor now! Now!

01:14:56.182 --> 01:14:58.449
On your knees now!

01:14:58.451 --> 01:15:01.788
Hands! Hands!
On the floor now!

01:15:02.455 --> 01:15:04.089
Cuff 'em.

01:16:03.618 --> 01:16:05.452
Hey, something's
fucking wrong, man.

01:16:19.532 --> 01:16:21.568
What the hell?
Where the fuck is my shit?

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.972
Boom.

01:16:36.583 --> 01:16:37.950
<i>Vamonos!</i>

01:16:42.789 --> 01:16:44.391
Let's go. Let's go.

01:16:51.898 --> 01:16:54.001
That fucking...

01:17:06.713 --> 01:17:08.949
All right, fucking bitch!

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:21.495
It's okay.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.315
Michael!

01:17:46.919 --> 01:17:48.753
You're safe now.

01:17:48.755 --> 01:17:50.724
Michael, I want to go home.

01:17:54.328 --> 01:17:56.562
My home.

01:18:15.615 --> 01:18:17.515
So, you just took it?

01:18:17.517 --> 01:18:20.918
Yeah. It was mine.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:24.790
The guy tried to kill me, so I figured
he at least owed me that much.

01:18:25.057 --> 01:18:26.859
My hero.

01:19:36.929 --> 01:19:38.096
- Hello?
- <i>Michael. It's Jesus,</i>

01:19:38.098 --> 01:19:39.865
Tijuana Police.

01:19:40.801 --> 01:19:44.538
We found a copy of Mateo's phone logs
and found his connection to you.

01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:46.506
It's Olivia Duran.

01:19:47.106 --> 01:19:49.475
We're tracking your phone.
We're on our way to you.

01:19:50.043 --> 01:19:51.876
If you are with her,
you are in danger, Michael.

01:19:51.878 --> 01:19:53.780
<i>You understand me?</i>

01:19:55.315 --> 01:19:58.584
No, that's great. We're actually
just on our way to meet O's family.

01:20:00.053 --> 01:20:02.556
I'll call you guys back.
All right?

01:20:03.022 --> 01:20:04.757
Okay.

01:20:05.659 --> 01:20:07.625
- Who you talking to?
- Just the guys.

01:20:07.627 --> 01:20:10.664
- Checking up on us.
- You okay?

01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:15.766
Yeah, just gonna go
wash up real quick.

01:20:15.768 --> 01:20:17.937
- And I'll be right back.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:38.959
<i>They still had
to choose you for a reason.</i>

01:22:32.639 --> 01:22:34.673
Michael.

01:22:38.012 --> 01:22:40.347
I can smell you.

01:22:41.147 --> 01:22:43.283
I know you're back here.

01:23:04.837 --> 01:23:07.639
You know, I have to tell you.

01:23:07.641 --> 01:23:10.141
I have done this before.

01:23:10.143 --> 01:23:13.845
And you made it more
interesting than any of them.

01:23:13.847 --> 01:23:16.415
But you had to mess
it up, didn't you?

01:23:16.917 --> 01:23:19.319
Couldn't you do
as you were asked?

01:23:21.887 --> 01:23:24.690
You cost me, Michael.

01:23:26.325 --> 01:23:29.662
And now what? You're
gonna to turn me in?

01:23:32.766 --> 01:23:34.934
Not gonna happen.

01:24:18.143 --> 01:24:20.379
If you needed money,
you could have asked.

01:24:22.115 --> 01:24:24.416
I would have done
anything for you.

01:24:24.418 --> 01:24:27.287
Men just want to use me
for my body. That's it.

01:24:28.288 --> 01:24:30.155
And you're no different.

01:24:31.223 --> 01:24:34.327
So, you want to do
something for me now?

01:24:35.128 --> 01:24:37.829
Well, you can. You can burn.

01:24:56.982 --> 01:24:59.485
Michael. What are you doing?

01:24:59.585 --> 01:25:01.921
Are you insane?

01:25:03.123 --> 01:25:04.856
Michael, you don't
have to do this.

01:25:06.159 --> 01:25:08.026
You always have a choice.

01:25:22.842 --> 01:25:25.178
Michael, help me!

01:25:25.878 --> 01:25:29.115
Come here, Michael! Help me!

01:25:40.259 --> 01:25:42.694
Michael! Help me!

01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:59.145
Michael, what happened?

01:25:59.713 --> 01:26:01.446
Where's Olivia?

01:26:02.548 --> 01:26:04.716
Careful. I have her
secured in the back.

01:26:04.718 --> 01:26:07.487
She's covered in gasoline.
She has a lighter.

01:26:07.887 --> 01:26:10.056
She killed the clerk.

01:26:23.936 --> 01:26:26.839
Thank you. You saved me twice.

01:26:26.972 --> 01:26:28.874
I'm just doing my job.

01:26:29.909 --> 01:26:31.475
Michael.

01:26:31.477 --> 01:26:34.046
There's something for you
in the glove compartment.

01:26:34.079 --> 01:26:36.315
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

01:27:51.123 --> 01:27:53.123
Hanging up your guns, cowboy?

01:27:53.125 --> 01:27:54.694
Something like that.

01:27:56.463 --> 01:27:58.531
This is why you
came all the way here?

01:28:13.963 --> 01:28:18.963
