and I think we know that now.

-However --
-You may just want to

20:45.922 --> 20:48.005
-stop right there.
-Almost done.

20:48.046 --> 20:51.839
However, you are totally
within your rights to bitch

20:51.880 --> 20:53.213
about the color of the door

20:53.255 --> 20:55.296
and anything that happens
outside of it,

20:55.338 --> 21:00.130

none of your fucking business.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.505
-Oh.
-Are we clear?

21:02.547 --> 21:04.338
You made your point,
Sugar Baby.

21:04.380 --> 21:06.005
Mm, that's gonna stop.

21:06.046 --> 21:08.088
I'm gonna need you to say
"We're clear, Izzy,"

21:08.130 --> 21:09.547
because that's my name.

21:09.588 --> 21:11.046
-We are clear, Izzy
-We're clear, Izzy.

21:11.088 --> 21:12.505
I never had an issue with you.

21:12.547 --> 21:14.422
I know.

21:14.463 --> 21:16.130
I will take that, so, thanks.

21:16.171 --> 21:20.422
Um, one last thing,
I want the house, okay?

21:20.463 --> 21:23.463
-I can't fuck this up for them.
-Sorry. It's out of my hands
now.

21:23.505 --> 21:25.422
Whoa.

21:25.463 --> 21:28.213
Okay, maybe I can make
the other offer go away,

21:28.255 --> 21:30.255
but it won't be easy.

21:30.296 --> 21:32.547
Done.
Ah, I'm exhausted.

21:32.588 --> 21:33.839
You owe me.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.296
I'm gonna go take
a well-deserved nap.

21:35.338 --> 21:36.630

21:36.672 --> 21:37.714

though, sorry.

-Okay.
-I'm hugging.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.547

if he used vinegar.
