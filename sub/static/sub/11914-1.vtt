WEBVTT

00:08.600 --> 00:09.761
- Are we on?
- We're on.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.445
<i>Where we at</i>
<i>with the levels?</i>

00:11.520 --> 00:13.010
<i>TECH 2; Left.</i>
<i>Right.</i>

00:13.760 --> 00:15.091
<i>I'm getting a little</i>
<i>hum from the guitar amp.</i>

00:15.200 --> 00:16.929
<i>You like it with</i>
<i>that sort of gutbucket sound.</i>

00:17.000 --> 00:18.206
<i>I want to be</i>
<i>convertible on this.</i>

00:18.280 --> 00:20.442
<i>I want to be able to switch it</i>
<i>back if it doesn't fit.</i>

00:20.440 --> 00:22.124
<i>- Check, check. Check.</i>
<i>- That's good.</i>

00:22.200 --> 00:24.009
<i>Jerry,</i>
<i>we're ready now.</i>

00:24.080 --> 00:26.162
<i>- Groovy, man. Let's go.</i>
<i>- Yeah, man.</i>

00:43.000 --> 00:45.685
<i>Sleep all day</i>
<i>Out all night</i>

00:45.680 --> 00:48.286
I I
<i>I know where you re goin</i>

00:48.280 --> 00:50.965
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>that's actin' right</i>

00:51.040 --> 00:53.964
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>it's showin'</i>

00:55.680 --> 00:58.160
- So these are your P30 tires, huh?
- That's right.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.446
- How many?
- A hundred thousand.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.521
A hundred thousand?

01:00.600 --> 01:01.647
God, that's a mountain
of rubber, Ben.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.324
Please don't tell me you're
offloading to a liquidator.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.525
- We use Cemensky Brothers.
- Cemensky Brothers?

01:04.519 --> 01:05.521
Look, I'm kind of
pressed for time.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.681
Can you get to the point?

01:06.760 --> 01:08.364
What, for 10 cents
on the dollar?

01:08.440 --> 01:09.726
Two percent
of your wholesale cost?

01:09.800 --> 01:11.404
What happens when
they dump 100,000 P30s

01:11.480 --> 01:13.642
to every discount chain that's
competing for your clients?

01:13.640 --> 01:17.201
Okay. Ten minutes.
Bottom line it for me. What's your cut?

01:17.320 --> 01:19.084
Well, I could pay you
100 cents on the dollar,

01:19.160 --> 01:20.730
your full wholesale cost,

01:20.800 --> 01:22.325
guarantee to
re-market overseas

01:22.400 --> 01:23.731
so you don't undercut
domestic sales,

01:23.800 --> 01:25.325
and for that, believe me,

01:25.400 --> 01:27.243
it's a river of shit
you don't want to go swimming in,

01:27.320 --> 01:29.084
we only pull 30 % commission.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.208
What is it you do again?
You buy tires?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.531
Among other things, yeah.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.444
I work in corporate barter.
I'm a facilitator.

01:36.520 --> 01:37.726
Thank you so much
for taking the time.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.689
Sam Harper,
Allied Trade Consultants.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.250
We buy and sell overstock.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.722
It's the barter system, Omar.
The original form of commerce.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.370
Look, every company
has leftovers

01:46.360 --> 01:47.521
after a sales cycle, right?

01:47.600 --> 01:48.761
Last year's electronics,

01:48.840 --> 01:50.444
ketchup bottles,
kitten calendars,

01:50.520 --> 01:51.931
toys that didn't sell
at Christmas.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.411
Anything with
an expiration date.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.811
Questionable baby formula.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.609
There's a market
for everything, Phil.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.569
Weyerhaeuser Paper,
U.S. Steel,

01:58.560 --> 02:00.210
Exxon Mobil, Fortune 500s.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.281
We work for the biggest
in the world.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.407
Do you have my card?

02:02.480 --> 02:04.767
Because in this economy,
paper is paper,

02:04.840 --> 02:06.842
but goods are good.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.765
Unlike the dollar,
barter does not depreciate

02:09.840 --> 02:12.241
one single percent.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.241
It's the new money.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.441
I mean, that's how
you have to think of it.

02:14.520 --> 02:18.730
You are getting in
on the ground floor of money!

02:25.480 --> 02:26.481
All right.

02:27.640 --> 02:28.766
Allied Trade Consultants?

02:28.760 --> 02:30.444
Allied Trade
and Barter, please hold.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.441
Allied Trade Consultants.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.567
Please hold
while I transfer your call.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.528
- Sammy!
- What's up, baby?

02:36.400 --> 02:38.323
- Oh, he's leaving.
- Uh-huh. Okay.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.606
I closed Lincoln Tire,

02:39.720 --> 02:42.291
a million, two,
in product. Yes!

02:42.400 --> 02:43.401
Yeah,
I'll make it right.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.448
You should've seen me
in there, buddy. It was a thing of beauty!

02:45.560 --> 02:46.607
I fed him
your "new money" line.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.443
It was like feeding a baby
a pacifier.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.325
Did you ship 100,000 cases
of tomato bisque to Ecuador?

02:51.440 --> 02:53.442
Yeah. Yeah, National Soup had
overstock they had to dump.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.601
And you shipped by train?

02:54.600 --> 02:56.443
Of course I did.
It was half as much as air freight.

02:56.520 --> 02:59.569
Through Mexico.
115 degrees and you ship by train.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.489
- What... What's the problem?
- The problem?

03:01.480 --> 03:02.641
I'll tell you the problem.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.767
Did you get Dolores
on the phone yet?

03:03.760 --> 03:05.171
Yes. Here's the list.
She'll be very happy.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.491
Thank you.
It's all about Dolores.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.481
I don't know
why you have to

03:07.560 --> 03:08.641
micromanage me
all of a sudden, Jim.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.211
I'm the best guy
you have on the floor. I'm a killer.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.327
Am I saving you
too much money?

03:12.400 --> 03:13.481
Yeah,
you're saving me money

03:13.560 --> 03:16.484
by shipping boxes
of soup in an unrefrigerated train car.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.166
- No, no, Jim, they were cans.
- No, they were boxes.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.890
I know specifically
that they were boxes

03:20.960 --> 03:23.167
because when
boxes get hot, they expand,

03:23.160 --> 03:24.650
and when they expand
they explode,

03:24.640 --> 03:26.847
and that train car
looked like a birthing suite at Bellevue.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.490
Shit!

03:28.640 --> 03:30.165
- You know what you did?
- This isn't a big deal, Jim.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.282
You violated nine provisions

03:32.360 --> 03:33.486
of the Sanitary Food
Transportation Act.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.289
I get it, Jim.
Will you listen to me for a second?

03:35.280 --> 03:36.850
And as soon as the Federal
Trade Commission finds out

03:36.920 --> 03:38.524
they're going to shove
a flashlight,

03:38.600 --> 03:40.728
a Klieg light, in my anus!
They're gonna put a light.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.131
Jesus Christ!
Wanna keep it down?

03:42.240 --> 03:43.241
Yeah, they're gonna
shine it up there

03:43.320 --> 03:44.481
because they want
to shut us down!

03:44.480 --> 03:45.686
You know they want
to shut us down!

03:45.760 --> 03:48.331
We barter.
We don't pay taxes!

03:48.440 --> 03:49.646
I will go
down to National,

03:49.640 --> 03:51.210
I'll talk to Phil Hymore,
the VP of Sales...

03:51.200 --> 03:52.531
- He loves me. I'll have...
- I talked to Phil Hymore.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.682
Phil Hymore's the one
who's threatening to call the FTC.

03:54.680 --> 03:55.886
Phil Hymore's
not calling the FTC.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.405
Yeah, he knows he has us
over a barrel.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.527
I'll throw him a deal

03:58.520 --> 03:59.521
and corrugate it
for his next shipment.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.365
He does not want corrugated.
Phil Hymore wants an addition.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.521
- An addition?
- To his house.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.726
He wants an addition
to his house.

04:04.720 --> 04:05.926
He's got a new wife,
Dolores.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.525
She doesn't like
the master suite.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.364
Smells his ex in the walls or
something. Do I give a shit?

04:10.360 --> 04:12.567
Are you telling me
you're bribing Phil Hymore

04:12.560 --> 04:13.846
not to report us
to the FTC

04:13.920 --> 04:15.888
by buying him
an addition to his house?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.723
For the record,
I did not use that word, okay?

04:17.720 --> 04:18.801
You're a genius! Genius!

04:18.920 --> 04:20.410
You moved, what,
two million of Lincoln Tire?

04:20.480 --> 04:21.527
Yeah.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.284
What's that
in commission, about 80K?

04:23.360 --> 04:24.407
Eighty-four.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.401
Eighty-four thousand.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.641
That should
just about cover it.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.204
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
No, no, don't do that to me.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.930
Jim, that's my year!
That's my nut, man!

04:32.040 --> 04:34.566
Technically it's not yours, it's
mine. Read your contract.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.251
Commissions are discretionary,
which means it's up to me.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.403
Jim, I need this money.
I need this money.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.245
You need? I need.
My two ex-wives need.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.810
My son in rehab needs.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.531
Which is why you need to
get everything on this list.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.369
That's lumber, copper,
conduit, piping,

04:49.440 --> 04:50.726
everything, all right?

04:50.800 --> 04:53.041
Call your vendors.
You got three days. Cut a deal.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.603
Let's see
a little ingenuity, okay?

04:55.680 --> 04:58.763
Get me the shit on that list,
otherwise your ass is fired!

04:58.880 --> 05:00.405
I'm not kidding!

05:14.040 --> 05:15.644
Shit!

05:20.440 --> 05:22.044
Hannah?

05:22.360 --> 05:24.408
I got to bail
on Kim's dinner thing.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.005
I need
a horse tranquilizer.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.881
Why are you cooking?

05:32.760 --> 05:34.046
You wouldn't
answer your phone.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.522
What's... What's wrong?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.722
Your mom's been
trying you all day.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.564
Your dad died.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.046
I'm so sorry.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.725
I'm so sorry.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.840
What's for dinner?

06:05.760 --> 06:08.366
Annie. Sam Harper,
Allied Trade. How are you?

06:08.480 --> 06:10.448
I'm in a bind.
I'm leaving town for a couple days.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.806
I was just hoping
you could help me out.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.848
Get a pen.
I'm gonna give you a list of all the stuff...

06:13.840 --> 06:15.888
Yeah...
No, I'm sure you are busy,

06:15.960 --> 06:17.769
but I happen to be in the
market for a little lumber.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.803
- Next in line, please?
- I know... I got to run.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.290
What do you mean
there's a lumber shortage

06:21.400 --> 06:22.686
- in the northeast?
- Sam... Okay?

06:22.680 --> 06:23.806
If you help me out
with this wood,

06:23.800 --> 06:25.006
I will get
your truck fleet...

06:25.080 --> 06:26.570
Sir, we need
your photo ID, please.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.483
I'll call you
when I land. Bye.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.561
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.971
- I just need your picture ID.
- Yeah, sure.

06:37.840 --> 06:38.966
What?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.523
I left it on the table
while I was packing.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.324
Sir, we can't let you board
the plane without ID.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.050
It is my father's funeral.
Tonight.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.406
It's a family emergency.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.891
If you go over to TSA, they can help you.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.370
I can't go to TSA...

06:51.160 --> 06:52.491
Nope,
that gets in too late.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.608
Is there anything
that gets into L.A. tonight?

06:54.680 --> 06:57.570
Listen, I just
need you to be a person right now.

06:57.640 --> 06:58.926
We are trying
to get to a funeral.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.526
Yes. Uh-huh. Okay.
What about going through...

07:01.600 --> 07:02.840
Come on. Let's go.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.524
What time
does that get in?

07:04.640 --> 07:06.563
Okay, let me just get
a pen out of the glove compartment.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.005
There are still
seats available?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.082
No, that's great.
And when does that leave?

07:10.440 --> 07:11.521
I don't know
if we can make that,

07:11.520 --> 07:12.806
but let me just
write that down.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.161
Oh, my God!
Baby, look!

07:16.480 --> 07:17.891
- Oh, my God!
- It was on the floor.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.008
Hang on. It must have
fallen under the seat.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.487
Yeah, it must have
fallen out of my...

07:22.600 --> 07:23.726
We can go.
We can go right now.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.644
No! She said that
was the last flight.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.046
No, no, no.
I'm talking to her now.

07:28.120 --> 07:29.610
She said there's a flight,
it goes through Denver.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.727
We'll get there late.
It'll be close,

07:30.800 --> 07:32.040
but we'll get there.
What's...

07:32.040 --> 07:33.121
Yeah, well, then,
let's do it.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.440
- Great! Okay.
- Thank you.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.601
I'll give you the number
right now. It is 5184,

07:39.040 --> 07:41.042
3801, 2373...

07:44.840 --> 07:46.444
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

07:46.440 --> 07:48.886
<i>I'd like to welcome everyone</i>
<i>on flight 86A to Los Angeles.</i>

07:48.880 --> 07:51.565
<i>We are currently cruising at</i>
<i>an altitude of 33,000 feet</i>

07:51.640 --> 07:53.802
<i>at an air speed of</i>
<i>about 400 miles an hour.</i>

07:54.440 --> 07:56.442
<i>Weather looks good, and with</i>
<i>the tailwind on our side...</i>

07:56.920 --> 07:58.001
I'll be right back.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.490
Well, he's not here.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.490
Friends,
thank you all for coming.

08:37.559 --> 08:38.607
We all knew Jerry...

09:14.400 --> 09:15.481
Hey, Mom.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.405
Okay,
I'm going to take off.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.009
- Love you, sweetie.
- Okay. Love you. Thanks.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.320
- Hi, Sheila.
- Hello, Sam.

09:29.920 --> 09:33.003
- You get my message?
- Oh, yeah, the airlines.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.685
They wouldn't even let me
on the plane.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.922
Yeah, just the way it is
these days.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.001
Yeah.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.850
Mom, this is, uh, Hannah.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.206
I'm so sorry.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.962
Now I have a face
to the voice.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.366
Beautiful face.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.249
How can I help?
What do you need me to do?

09:56.320 --> 09:57.924
I could clean,
I could do anything.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.202
- How long are you staying?
- We got to get back tomorrow.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.850
Hannah's got
a law school interview.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.884
Wow! Law school.
Your parents must be proud.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.842
- Where do they live?
- Chicago.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.889
- You get home to them much?
- Mom...

10:13.360 --> 10:14.964
I'm gonna go unpack.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.491
He would've liked her.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.521
Mom, I...

10:38.880 --> 10:41.042
The linens are in
the closet upstairs.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.890
I'm glad you're home.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.564
- What are you doing?
- It fell.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.287
"Hannah's got to get back
for an interview."

12:59.360 --> 13:00.964
Really? It's next week.

13:01.120 --> 13:05.045
I know. I'm sorry.
I just didn't know what to say.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.165
That's a first.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.248
What is this,
his man cave?

13:11.440 --> 13:13.204
More or less, I guess.

13:14.240 --> 13:17.210
I don't think
I've been up here since I was like, eight.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.201
Since you were eight?

13:18.280 --> 13:19.406
He'd come in
and lock the door...

13:19.400 --> 13:20.447
What do you mean,
"He locked the door"?

13:20.520 --> 13:22.443
I am cold.
Are you cold?

13:22.520 --> 13:24.568
No. Oh, my God,
is that Elvis Costello?

13:26.040 --> 13:30.728
Uh, yeah, he gave him his
first pair of ugly glasses,

13:31.080 --> 13:32.320
and, um, sort of
got Columbia to sign him.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.289
He doesn't look like
how you described him.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.965
I imagined this cold
Mr. Frost guy.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.242
He's got kind of
a sweet face.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.124
Yes, that's not
the guy I knew.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.485
Come on.

13:42.600 --> 13:46.241
It's your dad!
You don't have one happy memory?

13:46.360 --> 13:47.521
Yeah, one.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.607
He used to take me
to this park on Sundays.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.248
- That's nice.
- He never got out of the car.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.562
He'd sit and watch me
so he could...

13:58.680 --> 14:00.250
Listen to his demos.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.444
But, hey, you know,
that's how he discovered Kajagoogoo,

14:03.560 --> 14:05.324
so he did make
a major contribution

14:05.320 --> 14:06.321
to the human race.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.170
<i>Hi, Sam, it's Ike Rafferty,</i>

14:10.240 --> 14:11.969
<i>your father's attorney.</i>

14:12.120 --> 14:14.487
<i>I'd like to talk to you</i>
<i>about your father's estate.</i>

14:14.560 --> 14:16.005
<i>I could meet you for lunch.</i>

14:16.120 --> 14:19.602
<i>And maybe we should</i>
<i>keep this between us for now, okay?</i>

14:49.400 --> 14:51.164
Hey, Ike, sorry I'm late.
Parking was a nightmare.

14:51.240 --> 14:52.241
It is, yeah.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.527
- Been a long time, huh?
- It has been a long time.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.647
Wow, wow, wow.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.166
I won't say you look
the same, you're taller,

14:58.240 --> 15:00.607
but you do look
like your dad.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.368
Yeah, look at you,
the Manhattans.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.642
We used to have lunch
every Friday.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.210
The four of us, right here.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.090
- Same booth?
- Thirty-five years.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.521
- Wow.
- I'm the last of the Mohicans.

15:13.800 --> 15:14.847
So...

15:15.840 --> 15:18.241
How about the will?

15:19.760 --> 15:21.091
- The will is not complicated.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.002
Basically, the house and the furniture
go to your mom.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.001
Mmm-hmm.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.846
He left you his records.
Old vinyl. Pretty great stuff.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.325
And the money?
And what about the money?

15:30.640 --> 15:33.246
Well, you could probably
sell them for a lot.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.050
I think he'd rather
that you listen to them

15:35.040 --> 15:36.166
once in a while.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.850
Get your groove back.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.286
Get my groove back?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.250
Because what happened
to my groove?

15:47.240 --> 15:48.924
I knew I had it
here somewhere.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.883
All right.
You're disappointed. I get it.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.611
I am. I'm just
a little disappointed.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.728
I'm a little disappointed.
You get it.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.723
A week ago he asked me to
come see him at the house.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.211
He gave me this.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.645
It's for you.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.762
All I know is that
it's something

16:04.840 --> 16:06.729
he said he was working on
for a long, long time.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.964
He wanted you to have it.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.326
His shaving kit.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.249
Wow. That's great.
Did you open it?

16:17.320 --> 16:18.765
No, I didn't open it.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.250
Look, son.
I lent your father a suit

16:25.240 --> 16:26.890
so that he could
marry your mother.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.241
I never saw
that suit again.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.408
And I got the bill
from the caterer.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.726
That's the way it was
for 35 years.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.690
I loved him anyway.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.366
I hope you can, too.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.929
- Thanks, Peggy.
- Thanks, doll.

17:26.680 --> 17:27.886
Oh, my...

17:55.440 --> 17:57.442
- Yo, Josh, hold on.
- Yo, dude, shut up.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.847
What is it?

17:59.920 --> 18:01.331
Sodium from
the science lab.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.847
This hits the pool,
it'll totally detonate.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.163
- You mean it'll blow up?
- Yes. It'll blow up.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.766
- Bullshit.
- Dude, I'm telling you.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.450
It's a chemical. Watch.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.324
- I told you noth...
- Whoa!

18:27.960 --> 18:28.961
Oh, shit!

18:30.400 --> 18:33.051
- Shit! We got to go! Go!
- Let's go, let's go!

18:35.120 --> 18:37.282
Oh, my God,
that was awesome!

18:44.800 --> 18:46.040
I know your mother.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.120
Really?

18:54.240 --> 18:56.891
I'm sure you deal
with your share of working moms,

18:56.960 --> 18:58.166
more than your share,

18:58.320 --> 19:00.129
so I know you understand.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.009
Vandalism, Miss Davis.

19:02.160 --> 19:05.846
It's Frankie. Please.
And I know, it's my fault.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.371
You are right
to think that.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.129
I work in a bar.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.770
So, I'm sure that
there's something

19:11.840 --> 19:12.921
we can work out here.
Josh is...

19:13.000 --> 19:14.081
There's nothing you can say

19:14.080 --> 19:15.923
that has any relevance
to Josh's expulsion.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.406
You're going to expel him.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.966
What did you expect?
Your son blew up a pool.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.122
I can't have him putting
other students in danger.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.089
Frankly, I don't see
what more there is to talk about,

19:25.080 --> 19:27.242
and I have another meeting,
if you don't mind.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.322
There are some exit papers
I need you to sign.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.450
Where did Josh
get the sodium?

19:34.320 --> 19:35.924
Obviously
the science lab.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.361
Oh, okay, so,
just so I don't misunderstand.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.522
Is that the only
explosive material

19:40.600 --> 19:42.602
you leave lying around
for students to play with?

19:42.920 --> 19:44.490
Don't try
to shift the blame to his teachers.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.449
Where did he learn
it would explode in water?

19:46.440 --> 19:47.521
I don't care for your tone.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.921
Your school's recklessness
nearly killed my son.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.526
Good thing
he figured it out

19:51.600 --> 19:53.284
before he lost an eye,
or a finger,

19:53.280 --> 19:55.442
or a shitload of
Board of Ed. funding,

19:55.440 --> 19:56.965
because some parent

19:57.040 --> 20:01.011
might just be concerned enough to
go out and find a lawyer.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.009
Like those tough
pro bono types

20:03.000 --> 20:04.411
that hang out
in my bar at night

20:04.520 --> 20:06.329
and stare at my, well...

20:08.880 --> 20:10.450
I think you know
what I'm saying.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.961
I have no idea
what you were thinking today.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.208
Hey! Josh!
Are you even listening to me?

20:36.280 --> 20:38.567
Joshua Alan Davis,
this is serious!

20:38.640 --> 20:40.529
I mean, why couldn't you
shoplift or trespass?

20:40.880 --> 20:42.530
Where you lose me
is explosives.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.488
That's where I feel
like I'm not getting through to you.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.886
Hey, are you
listening to me?

20:45.960 --> 20:47.371
How am I going to
pay for that pool, huh?

20:47.440 --> 20:49.044
A lemonade stand?

20:49.040 --> 20:50.041
Oh, you think
you're the only one

20:50.120 --> 20:51.167
who can act like
an 11-year-old?

20:51.160 --> 20:53.162
I invented acting out
for attention.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.170
And congratulations,
you got to go to see a shrink now.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.005
She wants you to
fill out some workbook for your anger.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.525
- No way, Carol!
- Yes way.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.568
I'm not doing it, Carol.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.928
Don't call me Carol!
My name is not Carol.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.047
It's Mom,
for once in your life.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.690
No TV, no computer.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.045
That's child abuse.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.286
Yeah, well,
I can't wait for you

21:10.360 --> 21:11.646
to tell your shrink about it!

21:19.520 --> 21:24.048
Come on, monkey.
We both know you're smart.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.248
I know you're listening
in science class.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.042
Hey, Jenny,
can I call you back, please?

21:37.040 --> 21:38.280
It's a really
bad time right...

21:40.480 --> 21:41.561
Whoa, whoa, wait.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.726
No, what article?

21:53.040 --> 21:55.566
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.041
No, I'm...

21:59.320 --> 22:02.085
Yeah. I'll go. I'm gonna go.
I'll go right now.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.241
Thanks.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.489
- Hey, Frankie. Sorry.
- Hey, Ted.

22:22.560 --> 22:23.971
Do you have
yesterday's paper?

22:23.960 --> 22:25.610
Yeah.
Let me grab it. This is yesterday.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.446
Wow. You really need
that horoscope, huh?

22:32.160 --> 22:33.650
So, I was going to get
some dinner at some point.

22:33.640 --> 22:36.211
I don't know if you
have plans tonight, or...

22:37.480 --> 22:40.165
- Hello? Frankie?
- Do you mind if I keep this?

22:40.280 --> 22:41.691
No, of course not.
Go ahead.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.605
- Hey, are you all right?
- Can you watch Josh for me?

22:44.680 --> 22:46.603
For, like, an hour?
It's the last time, I promise.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.601
Absolutely.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.603
I have this emergency
that I have to go, um...

22:49.600 --> 22:50.681
Of course. Yeah.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.683
And, you know,
sorry about the dinner thing. It was...

22:52.760 --> 22:54.125
- Yeah. We're going to.
- Whenever.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.605
- Thanks, Ted.
- Okay.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.685
Come on,
come on, come on.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.285
No, no, no, no!
Come on!

23:17.400 --> 23:20.290
You had a yellow light,
for Christ's sake. Go!

23:20.400 --> 23:22.209
Come on! Come on! Move!

23:48.320 --> 23:49.765
Now it's
a different story.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.208
I'm not saying that
every day is a cakewalk,

23:52.200 --> 23:53.201
but it's working.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.203
I mean,
this program, it works.

23:56.160 --> 24:00.085
I'm a dumb,
antagonistic drunk

24:00.200 --> 24:03.363
who fought this
from day one.

24:03.520 --> 24:07.411
Surrender still sounds
like losing to me.

24:08.840 --> 24:13.164
But I stuck around,
and I'm sober. Thanks.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.446
All right.

24:15.520 --> 24:19.241
Before we take a break,
does anyone have a burning desire?

24:20.720 --> 24:23.849
Yeah. Hi. Hi.
Frankie, alcoholic.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.650
Hi, Frankie.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.891
Um...

24:28.120 --> 24:30.646
I wasn't planning
on coming today. This isn't my, um...

24:31.400 --> 24:33.641
I'm supposed
to be at work. At the bar.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.566
Uh...

24:35.560 --> 24:39.246
Temptation being
the mother of all tips.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.366
Uh...

24:41.720 --> 24:45.645
My son blew up a pool
at school today.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.765
With salt.

24:49.240 --> 24:52.926
And then I got a call
from my sponsor who...

24:54.600 --> 24:55.726
That, uh...

24:58.400 --> 25:00.243
"American record producer

25:19.440 --> 25:20.851
"and A & R man

25:20.920 --> 25:25.289
"who never achieved the
fame or credit he deserved."

25:34.200 --> 25:39.286
"He is survived
by his wife and son."

25:40.800 --> 25:41.881
So...

25:43.560 --> 25:44.800
It's official.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.483
I don't exist.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.480
Whoo-hoo!

25:51.280 --> 25:53.282
I'm beginning to think the
<i>editors at the L.A. Times</i>

25:53.400 --> 25:55.289
are even bigger pricks
than my dad was.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.922
I feel numb. Nothing.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.281
So...

26:03.760 --> 26:05.489
Why is it that I want

26:06.400 --> 26:08.528
five dirty martinis

26:09.480 --> 26:11.289
and a lot of other stuff?

26:12.400 --> 26:15.324
Just to cover up the...

26:18.800 --> 26:21.007
Okay. Blah, blah.

26:22.760 --> 26:25.001
So, that's...
That's all I got.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.800
Thank you. Thanks for
all the other sharers.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.321
Coffee and cigarettes
and onwards.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.288
Okay.
Who's next?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.445
Hi.

26:57.800 --> 26:58.847
You new?

27:00.520 --> 27:01.681
Knew what?

27:03.000 --> 27:06.243
N-E-W, newcomer
to the meeting?

27:06.560 --> 27:09.006
To the meeting.
No, no, no, no. No. I, um...

27:11.760 --> 27:14.684
I started in Tarzana,

27:14.800 --> 27:17.929
and then Culver City,

27:18.280 --> 27:20.760
and Studio City
was too sceney,

27:20.840 --> 27:21.966
but I heard great things
about this one.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.926
- I move around a lot to...
- Stay anonymous?

27:26.720 --> 27:27.767
It's just... It's...

27:28.280 --> 27:29.725
That's funny. Anonymous.

27:32.560 --> 27:35.643
That was a really
crazy share.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.330
Oh. Yeah.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.010
Do you have
another cigarette by any chance?

27:39.320 --> 27:42.369
I'm trying the gum to quit,
but it's killing me.

27:42.480 --> 27:43.561
Probably.

27:46.520 --> 27:47.931
Oh, no.
It's your last one.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.844
Oh, that's cool.
I like to pretend

27:49.920 --> 27:51.331
I didn't smoke
the whole pack.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.566
Thanks.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.446
Here. You know what?
It's a little...

27:58.440 --> 27:59.487
My hands are cold
or something.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.046
Just a little...
I have lady hands.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.521
I'm...

28:11.960 --> 28:13.405
I'm Sam.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.363
Oh! There goes anonymous.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.442
Frankie. Uh, welcome, Sam,
if you decide to stay.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.803
And you need
to learn to let go of your toiletries, man.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.120
It's the third step.

28:45.720 --> 28:46.721
Hey.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.441
Where is she?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.403
I'll assume that's an apology
and I didn't understand it.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.521
Is she upstairs?
Is she asleep?

28:51.600 --> 28:52.681
Yeah,
she's probably upstairs.

28:52.760 --> 28:53.886
She's probably exhausted
after spending

28:54.000 --> 28:55.161
the last eight hours

28:55.160 --> 28:57.003
cleaning the house
with her son's girlfriend.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.162
Where you been, Sam?
Did you have a nice day?

29:01.480 --> 29:02.606
What is wrong with you?

29:04.120 --> 29:05.360
What's going on?

29:05.440 --> 29:07.044
Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

29:15.160 --> 29:16.571
- Where did you get that?
- My dad.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.044
Hundred and fifty
thousand dollars.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.651
That he left to a woman
whose kid is my...

29:28.440 --> 29:31.091
In theory,
the kid is my nephew.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.010
I don't understand.
How could you have a nephew?

29:34.120 --> 29:35.724
You don't have
any brothers or sisters.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.041
I do now!

29:43.360 --> 29:45.886
At first I think
she's his mistress.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.804
I mean, that makes complete
sense, knowing my father.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.650
But then I look at her.

29:51.360 --> 29:55.684
She has my father's eyes
and his nose, and she...

29:55.920 --> 29:56.921
Sam.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.885
How are you going
to tell your mom?

29:59.240 --> 30:02.881
Surprise! You won
the golden ticket to the shit factory!

30:02.880 --> 30:04.450
I mean,
you have to tell her.

30:04.560 --> 30:05.607
I mean,
she has to know the truth

30:05.680 --> 30:07.648
and she's gonna find out that
he left them this money.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.250
Not if I don't
give it to them.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.602
- No, you're not serious.
- Listen to me. I am very serious.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.801
- It's $150,000.
- I know.

30:16.560 --> 30:17.891
That he left
in his shaving kit

30:17.880 --> 30:20.531
for some alcoholic
love child. I mean...

30:20.640 --> 30:23.371
- It's for the kid.
- It's for me! I'm his son!

30:23.480 --> 30:25.562
I'm supposed to hand it over
with a smile on my face?

30:25.560 --> 30:26.607
He waits
until he's dead

30:26.680 --> 30:27.806
to tell me about
his secret family?

30:27.880 --> 30:29.291
I can't tell her who I am.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.930
There's no way
I'm telling her who I am.

30:31.240 --> 30:34.244
I am buried, buried,
under a shit pile of debt, Hannah.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.845
- What are you talking about?
- A shit pile of debt!

30:35.920 --> 30:38.241
- We're in debt?
- No, no, we're not in debt.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.890
There is no "we," Hannah.
There's no "we."

30:39.960 --> 30:41.291
What do you mean
there's no "we"?

30:41.280 --> 30:42.361
"L." I'm in debt.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.646
I was gonna
get this commission

30:43.720 --> 30:45.529
to help dig me out
but now Phil Hymore's new wife

30:45.600 --> 30:46.647
needs an addition
to her deck...

30:46.720 --> 30:47.767
When were you planning
on telling me

30:47.840 --> 30:48.841
that there is no "we"?

30:48.960 --> 30:51.645
Is there any part
of my life that is off-limits? Any?

30:51.720 --> 30:52.801
Jesus!

30:54.400 --> 30:56.050
I knew we shouldn't
have come out here.

31:01.760 --> 31:02.966
Oh, my God.

31:06.280 --> 31:07.441
The wallet.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.361
What?

31:09.480 --> 31:11.960
You hid the wallet
in the car

31:12.040 --> 31:14.042
so you could avoid
coming out here.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.362
What?
That's complete bullshit.

31:19.480 --> 31:22.643
Yeah, yeah, it is, Sam.
It is complete bullshit!

31:22.800 --> 31:24.006
Will you
listen to yourself? Please listen...

31:24.000 --> 31:25.331
Why did you even
bring me through that

31:25.400 --> 31:27.004
ridiculous charade
at the airport?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.001
Come on, Han!

31:28.080 --> 31:29.525
Why did you even
get on the plane?

31:29.520 --> 31:31.488
Because you found us
another flight!

31:35.520 --> 31:37.488
Who the hell are you, Sam?

31:43.520 --> 31:44.931
Hannah, I understand
that you're angry.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.525
I would like to talk
to you about this.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.204
I'm so sorry, sir.
Thank you.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.851
- Hannah, I need you.
- Why do you need me?

31:50.840 --> 31:52.524
What, you need
someone else you can lie to?

31:52.520 --> 31:53.726
You don't have
enough suckers in your life, Sam?

31:53.720 --> 31:54.767
No.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.366
Goodbye.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.407
Hannah...

31:58.480 --> 31:59.766
Just go.

32:33.040 --> 32:36.089
Is Johnny there?
Johnny Dillon?

32:37.520 --> 32:39.045
I'm looking for Natalia.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.681
I'm Jerry Harper's son.
Jerry Harper.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.610
Jesus Christ.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.643
This is an odd question.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.449
Do you have a daughter?
Frankie?

32:49.560 --> 32:50.561
Hello?

33:14.080 --> 33:15.605
Hey, you'd love this.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.404
It's for the young
working woman

33:17.480 --> 33:20.404
struggling to maintain
a balance between her career

33:20.480 --> 33:21.811
and her personal life.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.686
At least
you think I'm young.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.609
I can see the bags
under your eyes.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.802
- You got to watch...
- Frances, Josh, I'm Amanda.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.763
Hi! Uh, sorry we're late.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.888
There was a ton
of traffic and stuff, so...

33:32.600 --> 33:34.648
All right, little man,
we'll see you...

33:34.640 --> 33:35.766
Why don't you
come in and join us?

33:36.040 --> 33:37.201
Oh.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.568
- All right.
- Sit wherever you like.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.050
Hey, oh, ah, ah, ah.
Come on.

33:44.160 --> 33:45.969
She said sit wherever
you want, so, uh...

33:46.040 --> 33:47.121
She doesn't mean
her desk. Get out.

33:47.440 --> 33:50.125
You know, today,
let's sit wherever we want.

33:57.720 --> 34:01.805
Oh, that's my...
This is for me. Okay.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.007
So, Josh,
I want you to know that

34:06.080 --> 34:08.208
whatever you're feeling
right now, it's all right.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.766
You can say whatever's on your
mind or nothing at all.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.130
She doesn't
want to be here.

34:13.199 --> 34:15.885
Yeah, but we have
to be here, so...

34:16.000 --> 34:18.650
- Well, for now, Frances...
- Oh, Frankie. Gosh.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.687
Frances...

34:19.760 --> 34:21.683
Please, call me Frankie.

34:21.679 --> 34:23.170
Frankie. Okay.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.244
Why don't you tell me
good things about Josh.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.649
Is this a trick question?

34:27.719 --> 34:29.484
There are
no trick questions.

34:29.639 --> 34:31.005
Just whatever
comes to mind.

34:31.679 --> 34:34.159
Yeah, no,
I have a great kid, I have a great kid.

34:34.480 --> 34:38.724
So, obviously,
he's very smart.

34:38.840 --> 34:41.491
And he's very funny.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.004
And, you know,
he was great right from the get-go.

34:45.159 --> 34:46.206
He was a great baby.

34:46.199 --> 34:50.170
He slept through the night,
you know, right away.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.844
He really never cried.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.121
Why do you think
that was?

34:55.239 --> 34:57.049
I'm sorry.
Why do I think what was?

34:57.040 --> 34:58.530
Why he never cried.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.286
- Why do you think that was?
- I don't know yet.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.250
Okay, well,

35:04.240 --> 35:07.084
my insurance covers four
50 minute sessions here

35:07.200 --> 35:08.611
and then
it's out of pocket,

35:08.680 --> 35:10.523
so I'd love it
if you could figure it out.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.523
And I don't know
how this usually works,

35:12.640 --> 35:13.926
but I was thinking
we could start by

35:14.000 --> 35:15.570
asking Josh some questions.

35:15.680 --> 35:16.681
Great.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.881
So, Josh,
why don't you tell us

35:19.880 --> 35:21.211
how you feel
about being here.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.285
I feel better already.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.681
Ah!

35:35.880 --> 35:37.882
- Oh, so you're still here.
- What?

35:44.320 --> 35:45.731
Hannah still asleep?

35:46.240 --> 35:48.720
She left.
She had to leave.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.731
Oh. I thought you guys
were going together.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.167
Looks like I have
to see some clients while I'm in town.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.570
What for?

35:56.720 --> 35:59.007
Oh, you know...

36:00.600 --> 36:01.761
Our company
just did a deal

36:01.760 --> 36:03.091
to donate
a million soccer balls

36:03.200 --> 36:04.804
made out of
disaster relief packaging

36:04.800 --> 36:05.801
to kids in the Sudan,

36:05.920 --> 36:07.251
so we do the logistics.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.080
So I figured
I'd stay around for a couple days,

36:18.160 --> 36:19.605
if that's cool with you.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.286
Stay as long as you like.

36:26.160 --> 36:28.766
No, Andy was supposed to call
you about this two days ago.

36:28.880 --> 36:31.247
About the wood, Bill.
About the wood!

36:31.360 --> 36:33.169
If I don't get
this guy's wife enough wood

36:33.240 --> 36:34.605
to build a deck
in eight hours,

36:34.600 --> 36:36.284
he's gonna report me
to the FTC.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.604
Here's my list.
She wants Mangaris wood, okay?

36:39.800 --> 36:41.802
It needs to be
diamond-finished Mangaris.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.122
Also, the barbecue
needs to be a...

36:45.280 --> 36:48.170
Needs to be
a 48-inch Viking,

36:48.920 --> 36:52.003
high-end stainless steel
with an infrared burner.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.690
What's up, guys?

36:55.320 --> 36:56.970
Bill, I'll call you back
in five minutes.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.291
Did you tell anybody
we were at the pool with you?

36:58.400 --> 36:59.640
No.

36:59.640 --> 37:00.641
If you say
anything about us,

37:00.720 --> 37:01.926
we'll beat
the living shit out of you!

37:59.160 --> 38:00.161
No.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.730
You're not getting
10 feet out the door.

38:02.840 --> 38:03.966
Look. Look!

38:06.040 --> 38:08.202
You can't be stealing CDs.
Nobody even buys CDs anymore.

38:08.280 --> 38:09.361
And it's a record store.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.885
You can't shoplift
from a record store.

38:10.960 --> 38:12.041
It's like kicking
a dead man.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.041
Do you work here?

38:15.720 --> 38:16.960
Probably only
a matter of time.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.246
I'm Sam.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.725
I sort of know your mom.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.801
You're not going
to tell her, are you?

38:25.920 --> 38:28.241
That your taste
in music blows? I don't know. Maybe.

38:28.400 --> 38:32.371
Look, this right here,
this is what you're looking for.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.245
Dude, if you try
and grab my balls...

38:35.360 --> 38:39.365
Whoa, whoa. What the fuck?
Try and grab your balls?

38:39.480 --> 38:41.289
If you even try,

38:41.280 --> 38:43.203
I will bite
your finger off. I swear to God.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.924
I totally get it.
Here you go.

38:45.880 --> 38:46.881
Go ahead.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.046
How do you know her?

38:50.160 --> 38:53.084
We, you know,
met in a meeting.

38:53.200 --> 38:56.283
- What step are you on?
- Eight.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.004
- Make your list yet?
- Huh?

38:58.120 --> 39:00.521
- Of people you screwed over?
- Oh, yeah.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.769
It's a long list.
I'll be on eight for a while.

39:03.880 --> 39:04.927
You know the steps?

39:04.920 --> 39:06.331
Carol has them
on the fridge.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.930
- Who's Carol?
- Frankie.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.087
Why do you call her Carol?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.764
Carol's our fat-ass
building manager.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.042
Has a moustache,
smells like deep-fried farts.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.850
Frankie doesn't see
the resemblance.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.046
I have to remind her.

39:16.160 --> 39:18.128
- How old are you?
- Eleven.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.969
What do 11-year-olds
do nowadays?

39:20.120 --> 39:23.124
- I blew up a pool.
- What?

39:23.240 --> 39:25.811
Yeah, I threw in
a sodium rock and it blew up.

39:25.880 --> 39:26.961
Part of it.
The deep end.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.320
Carol was pissed.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.965
Now I have to go
to kid therapy

39:29.960 --> 39:32.964
and play with blocks
till I cry.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.487
All right.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.006
Here we go.
Listen up.

39:37.080 --> 39:39.367
You're going to start
with Gang of Four, okay?

39:40.120 --> 39:43.090
Then you'll move
to The Buzzcocks.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.170
Then Joy Division.
Then The Clash.

39:46.320 --> 39:49.324
Finish up with Television.
In that order.

39:50.800 --> 39:51.847
You going to remember
that order?

39:51.920 --> 39:53.490
Maybe.

39:55.440 --> 39:56.885
All right. Here you go.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.441
Pay for them.

40:09.520 --> 40:12.126
Whoa! That's your car?

40:12.240 --> 40:14.322
Sweet wheels, dude.
Give me a ride.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.003
No, no.
Definitely not.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.441
Come on, Music Man,
you're already super weird.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.561
It's not going to
get any weirder.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.569
Look, can you just...
I got to go, man.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.449
I got to go. I'm sorry.
Can you just...

40:25.160 --> 40:26.161
<i>30")'-</i>

40:26.920 --> 40:30.402
All right!
Public transportation sucks ass!

40:44.040 --> 40:47.442
<i>Spanish songs</i>
<i>in Andalucia</i>

40:47.520 --> 40:50.410
<i>The shooting sites</i>

40:50.480 --> 40:53.450
<i>Oh, please, leave</i>

40:55.480 --> 40:57.608
- Your mom's not home?
- Work.

40:57.880 --> 40:58.927
Huh.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.081
Where?

41:01.160 --> 41:03.128
That hotel downtown,
The Standard.

41:03.240 --> 41:05.481
When, now?
Does she work nights?

41:05.600 --> 41:08.922
She kind of works nights,
double shifts. Whatever.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.882
She's not worried about you
being home by yourself?

41:12.040 --> 41:13.929
Dude, I know how
to microwave pizza.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.044
Plus, there's
Ted downstairs, Lucy next door.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.891
Seventeen, Mexican.
Goes braless.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.962
Owns a yoga DVD.
It's win-win.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.048
Oh. Don't forget this.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.209
Your musical edification.

41:32.200 --> 41:35.568
Gang of Four, The Buzzcocks,
Joy Division, The Clash,

41:35.640 --> 41:37.369
finish up with Television.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.289
But if you really
want to go number one with a bullet,

41:39.360 --> 41:40.964
there's six things
you got to know.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.041
Six things?

41:42.600 --> 41:44.170
Maybe I'll tell you
one day.

41:47.080 --> 41:48.923
Thanks for not
kidnapping me.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.441
No sweat.

42:03.760 --> 42:04.807
<i>They're attracted to me</i>

43:12.160 --> 43:13.161
Hi.

43:17.080 --> 43:18.320
I'm your brother.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.125
Hey, um...

43:29.200 --> 43:30.201
Oh.

43:30.280 --> 43:32.487
- Frankie.
- Mr. Anonymous.

43:32.640 --> 43:34.449
- You work here.
- Are you following me?

43:34.520 --> 43:37.569
No, I had a had
a work thing in the lobby downstairs

43:37.640 --> 43:39.130
at 8:00 p.m. Just ended.

43:39.240 --> 43:40.730
I thought I'd come up

43:40.720 --> 43:42.051
and check out the view
and the pool.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.121
Uh-huh.

43:43.200 --> 43:44.611
You know when
people are lying

43:44.600 --> 43:46.409
they tend to
over-invent details.

43:46.480 --> 43:48.244
Uh...

43:48.240 --> 43:50.368
- That was a joke.
- Caught again.

43:50.520 --> 43:53.330
Which you took seriously,
because maybe you are lying.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.726
Oh, no, no.
You shouldn't use maraschinos.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.722
They're soaked in
artificial food dye.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.087
Some people are allergic.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.248
Most companies
switch to natural.

44:03.320 --> 44:04.606
It's my job.

44:04.680 --> 44:06.648
Cherry activist?

44:06.720 --> 44:08.404
No, I'm sort of
a facilitator.

44:08.560 --> 44:10.528
You're a robot sent from
the future to kill me?

44:10.640 --> 44:12.244
Uh, corporate barter.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.641
You know, barter,
the original form of commerce.

44:14.760 --> 44:17.445
"Hey, you're a goat shepherd.
Sweet, I'm a chicken farmer.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.403
"I'll trade you
25 chickens for a goat."

44:19.480 --> 44:21.050
Goats, huh?

44:21.240 --> 44:22.446
Is your shift over?

44:22.800 --> 44:25.246
Yeah... Um...

44:28.160 --> 44:30.527
Can I get you something?

44:30.640 --> 44:32.085
That they sell here?

44:34.560 --> 44:36.483
No, no, no, no. Look...

44:36.480 --> 44:38.323
I swear to you
on my life I'm not

44:38.320 --> 44:40.800
and will never
hit on you, ever.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.768
Wow, thank you.

44:42.760 --> 44:45.081
I'm sure that was meant
to reassure me.

44:45.280 --> 44:46.770
No, I'm just...
I'm sure you get hit on all the time.

44:46.760 --> 44:47.761
I'm not one of those guys...

44:47.840 --> 44:49.604
I'm in a relationship
right now, so...

44:49.720 --> 44:52.610
Oh, that's so great for you.
What's his name?

44:56.120 --> 44:57.281
Can I get a Coke?

45:00.880 --> 45:02.928
Ah! That will be
25 chickens, please.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.326
I'm all chickened out.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.286
You can owe me.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.448
Management used
to let us wear sneakers,

45:10.640 --> 45:14.281
till they decided that
that was not upscale skank enough.

45:17.160 --> 45:19.162
- I'm sorry about your dad.
- Do you remember...

45:19.280 --> 45:20.486
- What?
- No, you.

45:20.560 --> 45:21.800
- No, go ahead.
- No, you were saying.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.531
- I'm sorry you were...
- No, you.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.409
All right, me. Um...

45:25.520 --> 45:26.646
I was just going to ask

45:26.720 --> 45:28.643
if you ever go
to the meeting on Colfax.

45:28.800 --> 45:31.371
No, I just...
I came out from New York.

45:31.360 --> 45:33.169
Because for some reason
you seem,

45:34.320 --> 45:37.563
I don't know... Familiar.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.884
I'm really sorry
about your dad.

45:46.840 --> 45:49.320
That's nice of you to say,
but don't be sorry.

45:49.400 --> 45:50.765
He was a dick.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.365
Why a dick?

45:55.360 --> 45:56.725
Well, he bailed
when I was little.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.688
Pretty much qualifies him
for dick status.

45:58.760 --> 46:00.205
How old were you?

46:01.520 --> 46:02.646
Uh...

46:03.440 --> 46:04.566
I don't know, eight.

46:05.720 --> 46:07.529
So, he was in your life
eight years?

46:07.520 --> 46:08.885
You know
what I love to do

46:08.880 --> 46:11.281
at the end of my
really long shift?

46:11.360 --> 46:12.521
Talk about my childhood.

46:12.640 --> 46:16.281
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

46:19.400 --> 46:23.530
My dad died, too, recently,
and, you know,

46:23.640 --> 46:27.725
he wasn't exactly
a gem of a human being, either, so...

46:28.720 --> 46:29.960
I've been there.

46:32.520 --> 46:33.806
- Sorry.
- No, no.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.888
God, you have no reason
to apologize.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.201
I'm the one peppering you
with questions.

46:41.560 --> 46:42.925
I'm gonna go.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.565
Yeah, I don't want
to keep you. I'm sorry.

46:44.560 --> 46:47.450
- Uh... Weird running into you.
- Yes.

46:47.440 --> 46:49.329
- Maybe I'll see you around.
- Sure.

46:50.240 --> 46:51.241
Okay.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.403
I do owe you
those 25 chickens, so...

46:54.400 --> 46:55.401
Yeah.

47:46.600 --> 47:48.807
<i>- Hi there.</i>
- Hi.

47:48.920 --> 47:51.002
<i>Do you have a hard time</i>
<i>making friends</i>

47:51.000 --> 47:52.684
<i>or connecting with people?</i>

47:52.760 --> 47:53.886
No.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.530
<i>Do you feel lonely sometimes?</i>

47:55.680 --> 47:57.284
“Hey!
- Hey.

47:57.440 --> 48:00.649
<i>Like you don't know how to</i>
<i>talk to anyone around you,</i>

48:00.720 --> 48:03.041
<i>maybe even the people</i>
<i>in your own family.</i>

48:06.040 --> 48:10.523
<i>Does it make you feel</i>
<i>frustrated? Sad? Angry?</i>

48:12.000 --> 48:13.729
<i>Are there days</i>
<i>when you just wish</i>

48:13.800 --> 48:15.484
<i>you could be</i>
<i>somewhere else,</i>

48:15.560 --> 48:17.324
<i>or even someone else?</i>

48:18.640 --> 48:21.007
<i>You may think you're</i>
<i>the only person out there</i>

48:21.000 --> 48:22.490
<i>who feels these things.</i>

48:23.760 --> 48:28.926
<i>But it's part of being human.</i>
<i>So welcome to people.</i>

48:30.040 --> 48:32.964
<i>We're about to learn some</i>
<i>simple relaxation tools</i>

48:33.080 --> 48:36.482
<i>to calm those angry</i>
<i>and frustrated feelings.</i>

48:36.640 --> 48:40.850
<i>Ready? First,</i>
<i>accept the way you feel.</i>

48:41.920 --> 48:45.527
<i>Try making a fist</i>
<i>with each hand, and then let go.</i>

48:46.000 --> 48:48.002
<i>Can you feel the difference?</i>

48:48.840 --> 48:53.562
<i>Second, find</i>
<i>a soothing activity to distract yourself.</i>

48:54.720 --> 48:56.927
<i>Maybe it's playing</i>
<i>with your favorite toy,</i>

48:57.000 --> 48:58.604
<i>or riding a bike.</i>

49:01.120 --> 49:02.531
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:06.680 --> 49:07.761
Oh, shit!

49:08.360 --> 49:11.523
<i>Don't be disappointed</i>
<i>if you don't feel better right away.</i>

49:11.680 --> 49:13.887
<i>It takes time</i>
<i>to find a perfect fit.</i>

49:14.040 --> 49:15.769
- You want to watch TV?
- You know, my kid's

49:15.760 --> 49:17.808
going to be up soon, so...

49:18.480 --> 49:19.970
Yeah. Okay.

49:20.680 --> 49:22.967
<i>Now, counting</i>
<i>down from five,</i>

49:23.080 --> 49:26.084
<i>let the relaxation</i>
<i>spread like a wave</i>

49:26.400 --> 49:27.890
<i>through your whole body.</i>

49:28.040 --> 49:32.125
<i>Five, four, three,</i>

49:32.480 --> 49:35.006
<i>two, one.</i>

49:35.120 --> 49:36.610
You found his meds.

49:37.400 --> 49:38.765
I believe so.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.487
Oh, God.
I shouldn't have done this.

49:49.600 --> 49:52.251
This is the medicine
for the nausea from the chemo.

49:52.400 --> 49:54.402
It's like...
I don't know what. It's like

49:54.480 --> 49:56.289
drinking altar wine.

49:56.280 --> 49:57.805
Oh, wow.

49:58.560 --> 50:01.609
You smell like your father.
Patchouli.

50:01.760 --> 50:05.242
Oh, God.
That used to turn me on.

50:05.400 --> 50:09.450
Oh, Mom. I'm not that stoned.
I will never be that stoned.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.930
How did you
end up with him, anyway?

50:11.240 --> 50:13.322
What do you mean?
You know we met at The Faces concert.

50:13.320 --> 50:15.926
No, no, no. I mean, you're
you, and he wasn't exactly

50:15.920 --> 50:17.604
the quarterback
of the football team.

50:17.760 --> 50:20.969
- He was handsome.
- Mom. He was a warlock.

50:23.480 --> 50:24.766
Don't laugh at me.

50:28.480 --> 50:30.642
You have to understand
something, Sammy.

50:30.760 --> 50:33.650
I was the hatcheck girl
at the Troubadour.

50:34.600 --> 50:38.810
I was 17 years old,
and he was like...

50:40.760 --> 50:42.728
The king of L.A.

50:42.840 --> 50:45.525
He said I reminded him
of Joni Mitchell.

50:45.520 --> 50:46.851
She's the reason
I moved here.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.962
I heard her voice
on the radio,

50:50.520 --> 50:53.330
and I said,
"Why can't that be me?"

50:53.440 --> 50:54.805
I could sing.

50:56.640 --> 50:58.051
Everybody said it.

50:59.760 --> 51:04.641
So, I came here
and I met your dad

51:04.640 --> 51:06.642
and then I met
Joni Mitchell.

51:06.840 --> 51:07.841
Oh, man.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.368
I met Linda Ronstadt
and Stevie Nicks.

51:15.600 --> 51:19.321
And Lillian Cresbauer
from Nutley, New Jersey.

51:20.840 --> 51:25.448
One night, we were
all sitting around joking and singing,

51:25.600 --> 51:27.887
and Jerry pushed me
toward the piano

51:27.880 --> 51:30.531
and said, "Get up there,
Lillian. They'll love you!"

51:30.680 --> 51:33.604
Nobody had ears
like your dad. He knew.

51:36.480 --> 51:37.925
He knew I was good.

51:39.520 --> 51:41.522
For Nutley, New Jersey.

51:44.520 --> 51:47.364
So, I sang.

51:49.720 --> 51:51.051
After that I...

51:53.000 --> 51:55.685
I never felt
like those people were my friends again.

52:01.920 --> 52:05.720
Wow.
You never told me that.

52:05.880 --> 52:07.769
Why would he do that?

52:07.840 --> 52:08.966
I don't know.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.604
He wasn't always
easy to understand.

52:12.600 --> 52:13.726
You know your father.

52:13.880 --> 52:18.681
What is not
to understand, Mom? He was a f...

52:19.720 --> 52:21.006
He was a prick.

52:22.880 --> 52:24.803
He humiliated you.

52:24.920 --> 52:27.082
You want to know
what was humiliating?

52:28.400 --> 52:29.890
I was the only one
at the funeral

52:29.880 --> 52:31.689
sitting next to
an empty seat.

52:32.600 --> 52:34.443
That was fun.
I didn't have to answer

52:34.520 --> 52:36.443
any weird questions
about that one.

52:37.840 --> 52:40.764
Oh, there's the sarcasm.
I remember that.

52:40.840 --> 52:42.968
Yeah, well,
what you probably don't remember

52:43.040 --> 52:45.691
is me changing
the plastic bags in his abdomen

52:45.760 --> 52:47.524
every two hours
so his shit wouldn't leak.

52:48.080 --> 52:49.445
Wow, Mom.

52:49.560 --> 52:51.927
That was like a double twist
on the high degree

52:51.920 --> 52:53.160
of difficulty
on that insult dive.

52:53.480 --> 52:55.448
He was in and out
of the hospital for a year.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.646
You never even called him.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.649
He didn't want
me around, Mom.

52:58.640 --> 52:59.880
Is that what
you tell yourself?

53:00.000 --> 53:01.923
And you let him
not want me around.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.810
You came home
maybe four times in the last 13 years.

53:04.920 --> 53:06.490
Usually to borrow money.

53:06.480 --> 53:07.925
How is the T-shirt
business, anyway?

53:08.120 --> 53:10.168
- Good night.
- That's right. Run away.

53:10.480 --> 53:12.926
At least it's the one thing
you're consistent about.

53:14.200 --> 53:15.770
You think you knew him?

53:15.840 --> 53:17.922
You saw what
you wanted to see.

53:19.600 --> 53:21.489
Can you really believe
I didn't know the man

53:21.560 --> 53:22.766
I was married to?

53:28.760 --> 53:29.807
Jane MacKenna again

53:29.880 --> 53:31.564
<i>from the Federal Trade</i>
<i>Commission, Mr. Harper.</i>

53:31.640 --> 53:33.005
<i>This is my second call.</i>

53:33.080 --> 53:34.525
<i>If you're not in our</i>
<i>Manhattan offices</i>

53:34.520 --> 53:35.521
<i>by the end of the week</i>

53:35.600 --> 53:36.840
<i>to assist our investigation,</i>

53:36.840 --> 53:38.842
<i>we'll be forced</i>
<i>to issue you a subpoena</i>

53:38.920 --> 53:40.524
<i>End of new messages.</i>

53:50.240 --> 53:52.686
We could tell her
we've been waiting here for 20 minutes

53:52.680 --> 53:53.727
and the button didn't work.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.484
So sorry we're late.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.688
The pickup line at school
was a total disaster.

53:57.760 --> 53:59.091
- No, it wasn't.
- Kind of was.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.491
Kind of wasn't.

54:00.920 --> 54:02.081
Can I talk to you
alone for a second?

54:07.160 --> 54:08.525
When I first got sober,

54:08.520 --> 54:09.806
I heard everyone
tell all the old-timers...

54:09.920 --> 54:11.046
I'm embarrassed,
I'm ashamed.

54:11.120 --> 54:12.690
I've been sitting here
listening to everyone.

54:12.680 --> 54:14.205
Frankly, I think
you're all quite mad.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.244
So, thank you all
for listening

54:16.520 --> 54:18.682
and keep coming back.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.683
- Good night, Frankie.
- Yeah, good night.

54:23.800 --> 54:24.881
Oh, shit!

54:30.960 --> 54:33.850
Pretty sure the purse was
designed to keep things

54:33.840 --> 54:34.841
inside itself.

54:35.040 --> 54:38.089
But I don't want to
mess up your process.

54:38.840 --> 54:42.890
I know what you're thinking.
"You again." Again.

54:44.280 --> 54:46.886
My last meeting.
I got to go back to New York.

54:46.880 --> 54:48.166
Thought I'd say goodbye.

54:48.280 --> 54:49.770
Cherry season
already, huh?

54:49.880 --> 54:52.008
Yeah.
Something like that.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.804
You know, it's...
Thank you.

54:59.760 --> 55:01.285
Assuming you've had
better days, huh?

55:05.560 --> 55:06.891
What gave it away?

55:07.040 --> 55:10.965
Shit, right before this
I got fired by my kid's therapist.

55:11.080 --> 55:15.608
Is it fired, do you think?
Or broken up with?

55:15.720 --> 55:16.721
What happened?

55:17.560 --> 55:19.130
I got caught in a lie.
I just...

55:19.240 --> 55:23.211
I was late, and I lied
about it in front of my kid.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.845
So...

55:29.200 --> 55:33.250
Look, I know
we don't really know each other at all,

55:35.200 --> 55:37.931
but you seem
like a really...

55:39.680 --> 55:41.205
Like a really
great person.

55:42.040 --> 55:45.761
I'm not a professional

55:46.840 --> 55:48.968
parent or whatever,

55:51.280 --> 55:52.850
but I'm pretty sure
there's no such thing

55:52.920 --> 55:54.365
as a textbook mom.

55:57.680 --> 55:59.648
Your kid's really lucky
to have you.

56:02.760 --> 56:03.761
Bye, Frankie.

56:09.240 --> 56:10.321
Wait!

56:13.680 --> 56:15.125
I mean...
You're leaving now?

56:15.280 --> 56:17.965
I mean, before it was okay,
but now...

56:18.960 --> 56:20.883
We should get a taco
or something.

56:22.280 --> 56:23.281
Really?

56:23.640 --> 56:25.927
- Or not. Never mind.
- Absolutely.

56:26.040 --> 56:27.883
Absolutely never mind?

56:28.880 --> 56:30.644
Absolutely tacos.

56:32.960 --> 56:34.803
I realized that

56:34.920 --> 56:38.402
I feel sorry for my clothes
that I don't wear,

56:38.760 --> 56:43.129
so I rearranged my closets
so the stuff from the back

56:43.240 --> 56:47.370
got moved to the front
so it could have more face time.

56:49.080 --> 56:50.320
- I'm nuts.
- That's crazy.

56:50.640 --> 56:53.325
In high school
I was in a band called Technical Virgin.

56:54.840 --> 56:56.330
In high school
I was on a team

56:56.320 --> 56:58.721
of technical virgins
called "cheerleaders."

56:58.840 --> 57:01.320
- No!
- I got kicked oh' the team.

57:01.680 --> 57:03.842
- Why?
- I wouldn't do lame cheers.

57:03.960 --> 57:06.042
It's not good to have
the pompon girl be like,

57:06.120 --> 57:07.167
"This is bullshit!"

57:07.280 --> 57:08.406
Can you show me
a lame cheer?

57:08.720 --> 57:10.210
- I'm not doing any cheers.
- Come on.

57:10.320 --> 57:12.687
I know one cheer.
It's from a Faith No More song.

57:12.800 --> 57:16.043
"Be aggressive.
Be-Be aggressive.

57:16.200 --> 57:19.090
"B-E-A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E."
Anybody?

57:19.200 --> 57:21.726
"Be aggressive.
Be-Be aggressive."

57:21.840 --> 57:25.686
Let me just recap.
So, you're losing and I am winning.

57:25.800 --> 57:28.201
No, I'm not. I'm very
competitive right now.

57:28.360 --> 57:29.885
You were in a shitty band.

57:29.960 --> 57:32.008
That's all you've brought
to this entire situation.

57:32.120 --> 57:33.724
You better come up
with something good.

57:33.840 --> 57:35.046
Wow.

57:37.280 --> 57:39.169
I lied to avoid a funeral.

57:40.120 --> 57:43.329
- I give that like a six.
- Six? Bullshit, six.

57:44.480 --> 57:46.960
Good lord,
it's like watching the nature channel.

57:47.080 --> 57:48.206
Don't watch me eat.

57:48.320 --> 57:51.722
Every spring, the wild
Frankie migrates to the...

57:52.880 --> 57:54.120
All right.
I'm going to finish you.

57:54.240 --> 57:56.368
I'm going to sweep the leg.
Here it comes. You ready?

57:56.480 --> 57:58.289
Yeah. Please. I'm ready.

58:02.200 --> 58:05.488
I was a bit of a nightmare

58:05.800 --> 58:08.280
when I got pregnant
with my kid.

58:08.360 --> 58:09.407
Mmm-hmm.

58:09.480 --> 58:12.404
I would you know,
wake up, drink,

58:14.040 --> 58:17.169
score, bump, get laid,

58:19.080 --> 58:21.128
pass out, rinse, repeat.

58:24.040 --> 58:27.283
No numbers.
No names. So...

58:29.520 --> 58:33.764
I have no idea
who my kid's dad is.

58:35.440 --> 58:40.401
And I still ended up
with my little munchkin

58:43.080 --> 58:44.491
and he saved my life.

58:49.760 --> 58:52.127
- Ta-da!
- I fold.

58:53.320 --> 58:54.970
You can't win this game
if you don't have kids.

58:55.120 --> 58:58.010
Speaking of folding,
I have to go do laundry. I'm sorry.

58:58.120 --> 59:00.407
I don't want to intrude on
your laundering space, but...

59:00.520 --> 59:03.126
I would love
to not go to the laundromat by myself.

59:03.200 --> 59:04.964
So, sure.

59:07.080 --> 59:09.447
You ate
a lot of nachos.

59:09.560 --> 59:11.130
- So what?
- Not.

59:11.120 --> 59:12.531
Not an astronaut?
Why not?

59:12.520 --> 59:14.124
It's not going
to be astronaut.

59:14.240 --> 59:16.208
I don't know.
In another life,

59:16.320 --> 59:18.527
I could've been a landscape
architect or something.

59:18.520 --> 59:20.522
Why not this life?
Why another life?

59:20.840 --> 59:22.524
You need a degree
or something.

59:22.840 --> 59:24.410
Why not do that now?

59:24.520 --> 59:26.249
I barely made it through
school the first time.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.162
Yeah, well, I shouldn't be
doling out career advice.

59:29.320 --> 59:31.368
Trust me,
career advice from me is...

59:32.920 --> 59:35.969
No. Be afraid.
Be very afraid.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.161
Are you all right?

59:42.480 --> 59:44.005
It's my dad.

59:44.840 --> 59:46.410
He used to bring a change
of clothes to our house

59:46.480 --> 59:47.527
when he came to visit.

59:47.840 --> 59:49.001
He always smelled
like patchouli,

59:49.080 --> 59:50.206
and my mom hated it.

59:50.960 --> 59:55.443
So it was my job to wash
and fold his laundry.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.600
Anyway.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.201
How did they meet?

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.844
Backstage at a
King Crimson concert.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.522
My dad was a music
manager. A & R guy.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.205
My mom was this
L.A. scenester.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.406
A groupie, basically.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.961
For a while, he'd come on
Sundays. We'd go to movies,

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.280
have a picnic.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.529
He just had this light.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.089
And when he would laugh,

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.527
it made me feel like
I was really funny.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.371
But then he stopped coming.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.050
No more light.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.571
Did you ever
see him again?

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.047
I tried to see him.
When I was 15.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:00.642
I actually bought a dress,
took the bus to his studio.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.404
He kept me an hour
waiting in his office

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.090
and then we
finally got in his car...

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.605
Which one?
I mean, what kind?

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.288
He had a Country Squire.
That's an old station wagon.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.923
And we went to this house
in Los Feliz. Some guitarist.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.328
And I was standing
in the corner,

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.126
staring at my shoes
in my discount prom dress.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.482
They were smoking
and drinking and...

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.082
I just kept telling myself,

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.966
"Do not give this man
your tears."

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.246
After a while
he drove me home, gave me a $50 bill,

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.450
and my last image of my dad

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:59.409
are taillights
while he drove away

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.125
to his other family.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.326
And the crazy thing is,
you don't ask,

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.163
"What's wrong with him?"

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.406
No. You ask,
"What's wrong with me?"

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.691
There's nothing wrong
with you.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.047
Mostly I'm just still pissed
he got me in a dress.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.681
So, the...

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.484
The other family,
did he ever talk about them?

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.600
I didn't want to know.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.049
I hated them.
They got him.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.600
What about your mom?

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.244
My mom died
a couple years ago.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.770
My sweet mom.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.202
You know, she never said
a bad word about him.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.565
Can I just say,

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:15.406
your life is ass.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.609
It's really...

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.085
Don't laugh at me.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.282
No, I'm not.
I'm not laughing at you.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.569
I'm just thinking
how strong you are.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.200
- I don't feel strong.
- You're incredibly strong.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.765
So when is your flight?

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.801
Uh...

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.642
I got
a text earlier, actually,

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.240
and things are shifting
around at work, so...

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.323
Looks like I have to stay
in L.A. a little longer.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.526
I know
it's about the nachos.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.401
Nachos, please.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.166
You stuffing your face
like a wildebeest in heat.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.121
<i>Early one morning the sun was shining</i>
<i>I was laying in bed</i>

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.125
<i>Wondering if she'd changed at all</i>
<i>If her hair was still red</i>

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.971
<i>Her folks, they said our lives together</i>
<i>Sure was gonna be rough</i>

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.967
<i>They never did like</i>
<i>Mama's homemade dress</i>

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:14.281
<i>Papa's bankbook</i>
<i>wasn't big enough</i>

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.329
<i>And I was standing</i>
<i>on the side of the road</i>

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.609
<i>Heading out</i>
<i>for the East Coast</i>

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.365
<i>Lord knows I've paid</i>
<i>some dues getting through</i>

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.364
Come on. Let's go.
Hustle, Carol.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.601
Okay.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.409
Hey, man. No.
Oh', off, off.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.288
Hey, look. Your backpack
that you left in the backseat?

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.361
It's in the trunk.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.481
That's where that was?

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.721
Also, the ride home
from the record store,

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.801
maybe not mention it, okay?

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.690
- Why?
- Hey, there.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.806
Nice car, huh, Josh?

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.284
Josh, Sam.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.521
Howdy.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.640
What's up?

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.490
All right, child. Hey, hey!
No, no, no! Oh... Okay...

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.325
<i>We drove that car</i>
<i>as far as we could</i>

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.561
<i>Abandoned it out west</i>

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.850
A little glamour face.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.651
I can't actually
shoot anything.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.364
- Are you filming?
- Yeah!

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.888
<i>I heard her say</i>
<i>over my shoulder</i>

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:20.169
<i>"We'll meet again someday</i>
<i>on the avenue"</i>

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.561
Whoo!

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.721
<i>Tangled up in blue</i>

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.681
This is incredible.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.526
My gosh,
look at its little face.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.601
It's looking right at me.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.603
Please, sir, spare my life.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.808
I don't deserve
to be eaten, mate.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.685
What? Why is
the crab British?

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.600
You gotta
mallet that thing.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.767
Because I'm a hater.

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.966
Let's hear
a little Keith Moon.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.805
Whoo! Drum duet!

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.761
Hit it!

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.205
Oh!

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.406
Let me show you a trick.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.687
Take the crab leg like such.
We go like that.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.647
We take our handy red
crab claw.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.646
There you go, buddy.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.326
- Yeah, I've seen better.
- Oh, yeah.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.246
Yeah, God,
is this the best you got?

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.881
- Ugh!
- Josh!

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.761
But it's real.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:41.686
Thank you!

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.245
And I'm still crying.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.481
Hello?

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.284
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.006
How are you?

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.721
<i>You know. Amazing.</i>

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.002
<i>A woman keeps calling</i>
<i>and leaving messages.</i>

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.411
<i>I think she wants</i>
<i>to arrest you.</i>

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.329
<i>So, at least</i>
<i>I'm not the only one.</i>

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.771
Why did you call?

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.928
Just wanted to hear
that I didn't lose you

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.966
to some circus troupe
of lawyers.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.885
I know you do.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.008
- I should go.
- I met her.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.805
<i>Her name's Frankie.</i>

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.486
<i>She tried so hard</i>
<i>to get his attention.</i>

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.811
Get him to notice her.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.006
It's almost like we did
grow up in the same house.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.970
Except you ran away from him
and she didn't have a choice.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.002
<i>You're good at running away,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.481
Yeah.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.370
<i>I've been practicing</i>
<i>a long time.</i>

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.805
<i>And I know</i>
<i>it's hard on you.</i>

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.050
<i>Did you tell her</i>
<i>everything you know?</i>

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.001
<i>I don't know how.</i>

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.600
Sam...

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.564
<i>You're going</i>
<i>to hurt this woman, you realize that.</i>

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.569
<i>And you got to make it right.</i>

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.840
<i>I got to go,</i>

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.728
Dude, I could
totally be in a band.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.359
You know what I'd call it?
My Friend's Band.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.086
Like, "You got to see
My Friend's Band."

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.845
Or like, "You got to hear
My Friend's Band."

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.883
Oh, my God.
People would be so confused.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.923
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, Luce.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.569
<i>That girl is so caliente,</i>

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.721
I don't even know
what to do with myself.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.569
Actually, I do know
what to do with myself.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.042
Oh, God, no.
No, Romeo.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.920
So, can I just
ask you questions

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.081
and you answer me?

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.965
Not as my mentor,
just as some old dude?

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.002
Oh, that would be great.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.171
How do you get
girls to like you?

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:28.084
"How do you get
girls to like you?"

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.049
Well, you know,
you just want to be the...

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.925
Well, you want to be
the kind of guy that, like...

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:35.966
Uh...

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:37.850
- You know.
- No, I don't know.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.206
And it sounds like
you don't either.

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:41.442
That's true.
Here. Strawberries.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.841
At least tell me
the six rules.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.281
Nah. You're not ready.
Soon enough.

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:49.046
- Come on. Come on.
- Soon. Soon, I swear.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.486
Don't deny me
like that, man.

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:51.481
He)'

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.764
Hurricane Carol
finally made landfall today,

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.121
pulverizing
Southern California.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.967
Nice catch.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.127
- What is this?
- That's a salami sampler.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.810
Because it turns out
there is more than

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.211
one type of salami.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:08.483
Hot salami, sweet salami,
all the kinds of salami.

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.080
- Whoa, whoa. I got it.
- That made my day.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.202
Josh, can you go
do your homework

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.406
or something, please?

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.847
Why? You barely
made it through high school.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.126
Look how well
you turned out.

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.210
Hey, hey. All right.
Thank you. Goodbye.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.521
Go be productive, please.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.329
Yeah, let me go
invent something.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.207
Do I look like
I can't provide for my kid? I work.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.402
No. I know.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.926
You got a lot on your plate.
I was just trying to help out.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.090
What's going on?

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.405
A lawyer called today.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.327
Mmm-hmm.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.165
My dad left Josh 150 grand.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.011
Wow. That's...

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.161
- That's great.
- No.

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.124
I don't want his
dead bribe money.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.365
You can't turn down
$150,000, Frankie. That's...

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.283
Frankie,
you could buy a house

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.407
with a yard
for your gardening.

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.567
You could
pay oh' the pool,

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.001
you can go back to school.
Whatever.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.201
He wanted you to have it.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.406
What, are you
on his side now?

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.124
It's 150 grand!

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.486
Okay.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:20.245
What is this?
What's going on here?

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.090
This...

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:26.209
This is Josh missed the bus
and I picked him up.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.407
He said you guys
needed some groceries,

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.606
- so I decided to help out.
- No. This.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.122
This hanging outwith us.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.526
I like hanging out
with you guys.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.121
Why don't I know
anything about you? I mean...

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.890
What is with
the 20 questions?

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.371
Why won't you ever
talk about your recovery?

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.931
Most of us
can't talk about it enough.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:40.921
I don't know.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.042
Why do you have
these weirdly long pauses

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.087
when I ask a question?

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.440
I bought you groceries!

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.885
I didn't ask you
to do that.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.365
- You're grilling me?
- Just answer my questions.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.086
The world does not need
another AA sob story.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.004
Is that a good enough
answer for you?

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.608
It's a really shitty
answer, actually.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.125
Do you hate the idea
of making your life better?

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.361
Is it that bad of an idea?

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.642
Well, you're one to talk,
Mr. Goat Leverager.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.401
I mean, is that you
realizing your potential?

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.562
I'm just saying,
you can have a better life. All right?

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.245
You can leave the bar
and be appreciated.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.169
- For what?
- For who you are!

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.521
- The same goes for Josh.
- Okay, whoa.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.330
You think maybe you're not
in the best position

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.164
to be handing out
parenting advice?

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.328
Have you ever even
taken care of a goldfish?

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.444
Do you comprehend
what it is to be responsible

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.010
for another human being?

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.250
You cart him around.
You... You stock my fridge.

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.363
You're atoning for
I don't know what.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.403
'Cause I enjoy hanging out
with him. He's a good kid!

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.090
You're gonna go back
to New York.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.723
And how's my kid
gonna deal with that?

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.962
So I'm just asking you,
what do you want here?

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.005
You want me
to tell you to stay?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.128
No, no.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.685
Is that what
you're looking for?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.561
I said it. I would like you
guys to be happy. That's it.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.686
That's all you want?

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.640
I got to go.

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.171
Mom.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.049
- Oh...
- What's wrong?

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.008
Oh, I just...
I stood up too fast.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.521
I just get
a little dizzy sometimes.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.608
Sometimes? How often?
How long has this been going on for?

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.529
Where have you been, huh?

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.721
Does she have a name?

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.048
I liked Hannah.
She's good for you.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.770
Let me just help you up.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.525
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.125
Do you want me
to call a doctor?

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.690
No, please. No violins.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.569
I just need
a little fresh air.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.369
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, I understand.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.201
Mmm-hmm.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.089
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.241
<i>Okay, I'm here to help.</i>

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.367
Okay, We-

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.446
She said
you have some kind of

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.726
plaque buildup
around your heart.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.165
Mmm-hmm.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.483
- Arterio...
- Sclerosis.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.766
Mmm-hmm.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.444
You've known about it
for a year.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.090
Why aren't you treating it?

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.567
- I am treating it.
- By not eating Entenmann's?

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.291
That happens to be
a real sacrifice.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.450
It's an outpatient procedure.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.648
It will take four hours.
It's not surgery.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.445
I've had enough doctors
for one lifetime.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.090
That's great, Mom,
suffer in silence.

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.081
That's really smart.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.810
At least I do it
in silence.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.770
What a wonderful
philosophy, Mom.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.129
It really made
for a happy home.

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.485
I mean,
it's a great philosophy.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.807
You didn't want to talk,
he didn't want to listen.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:25.767
No one actually tells anyone
what's really happening.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:29.442
Okay. Seeing that
your father is too dead to defend himself,

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.441
you got me.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.762
Let's hear all about
how bad you had it.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.606
He was a liar.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.326
- Professionally.
- It's a lot to live down to.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.441
And this girl
you're dating,

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.443
that's the real reason
you're hanging around here, isn't it?

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:41.521
What is she,
a waitress?

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.325
Ah. Kid?

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.446
You don't want to
have this conversation, Mom.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.561
How'd you guys meet?

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.687
No, no, no, play fair.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.325
You don't want to
have this conversation.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.811
It's really not right
that you know all about Jerry

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.120
and I'm not allowed
to go after...

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.526
What was her name again?

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.849
You want to hear about her?
I'll tell you all about her.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:58.411
Oh, can we rule out
Princess Charlotte of Monaco?

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.124
She has a son,
she's an ex-addict,

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.241
and we met at AA.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.283
Trifecta! AA?

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.164
And she's Jerry's daughter.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:20.169
You are an only child.
You know that.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:30.291
Wait a minute. Did you know?
Hey, answer me. Did you know?

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.686
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.205
Oh, my God.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.169
Will you please stop lying
and just tell me the truth?

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.161
You know her name.
Say it.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.366
I don't know what
you want me to say.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.203
Say it.
Say her name. Say it.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.765
I am not going to have
this conversation with you.

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.848
- It's Frankie!
- Who told you?

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:49.207
We moved past this
a long time ago. It's over.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.681
You knew.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.366
His responsibility
was to this family.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.289
Our family.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:02.370
For you, for your sake,
you should be grateful.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.644
She grew up
without a father.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.283
It was his choice.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.206
- Was it?
- He made peace with it.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.403
He hid $150,000
and gave me instructions

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:16.720
to give it to her.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.401
Stop it.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.040
- He wanted us to meet.
- I don't want to hear this.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.571
He has a grandson.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.800
What did you do?

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.526
What did you do?

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.408
It's been lovely
to see you, Sam.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.131
Maybe we'll do it again
in another couple of years.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.449
Mr. Harper, I'm an attorney

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.771
<i>calling on behalf</i>
<i>of James Richards</i>

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.125
<i>to let you know</i>
<i>your employment</i>

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.247
<i>is hereby terminated.</i>

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.609
<i>Under the circumstances,</i>
<i>you'd be well advised</i>

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.603
<i>to seek legal counsel</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.488
All right.
It's arranged by genre, okay?

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.807
You got old school R&B,
mid-'70s funk shit,

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.404
pretty obscure jazz,

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.284
world music,
some West African drumming,

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.362
soundtracks to
the French pornos.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.449
My personal top 40.

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.329
It's a lot of rare shit.
It's worth money.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.249
This is so awesome.

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.441
Let's hook up
the record player

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.205
and play shit really loud
until she gets home.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.285
I can't.

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.602
Wait. Come on.
Grand Theft Auto, pizza...

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.723
Maybe I'll even do
a little homework.

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.444
I can't. I got to go.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.528
- When can you?
- I don't know.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.641
Let's make a plan.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:32.644
Enough with it.
Enough! Okay?

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.842
"Let's eat pizza, Sam.
Let's play video games."

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.330
I have real shit
to deal with.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.527
And I can't babysit you

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.523
because you don't have
any real friends.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.569
Don't look at me like that.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.806
I have to go back
to New York now.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.531
Will you tell, uh...

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.681
Will you tell Frankie that

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:47.727
I'll call her
when I get there?

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:52.328
You tell her, douche.
I'm not your fucking secretary.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.608
All right, guys,
we have the helix.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.801
There's two different
parts of it.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.406
You have the tangent
and the axis.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.885
Can anyone
tell me the difference

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.486
between the right
and the left-handed helix?

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:36.881
Yeah.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.365
Yes, it is.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.565
Hi, this is Sam Harper.

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:46.641
You've been trying
to reach me?

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.802
<i>You've been avoiding</i>
<i>us, Mr. Harper.</i>

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.809
<i>You're being charged</i>
<i>with violating Section 5</i>

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.370
<i>of the Federal Trade</i>
<i>Commission Act.</i>

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.521
<i>We need a complete accounting</i>
<i>of your records</i>

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.971
<i>or we'll go after you</i>
<i>as an individual.</i>

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.565
- Do you understand?
- Can you hold on for a second?

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.244
<i>Look, I don't think</i>
<i>you're taking this seriously enough.</i>

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.446
<i>We can hold you in contempt.</i>

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.488
I could not be taking this
any more seriously.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.721
Please, if you could just
give me a second.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.803
- I need to take this call.
<i>- You have 30 seconds.</i>

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.488
Hi. I was
going to call you.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.284
Hey. Josh broke
a kid's nose,

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.488
<i>and the parents</i>
<i>are going to press charges.</i>

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.607
Oh, Jesus...

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.647
Yeah. I'm headed
to school right now.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:16.721
Can you please come?

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.690
I'm totally freaking out.
Hello?

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.731
I'm at the airport.

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.570
Right. Yeah, forget it.
Forget it. Fuck.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.441
Sir?

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:32.606
Picture ID?

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.891
Come on.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.809
I'm here
to pick up my son.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:58.926
Josh...

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.721
Hi.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:14.086
Hey, monkey.
Are you okay?

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.961
I'm sorry.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.729
I know. I know you are.

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.647
I've convinced
Derek's parents not to press charges.

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.000
Oh, thank God.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.570
Let's talk in my office.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.481
Thank you.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.809
Hey, I had money
on the fight.

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.169
So,
maybe I could do like

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.004
40 hours of
community service?

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.926
And I could go back
to Toluca Park?

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.480
No, honey.

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:54.487
Are you sure?

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.523
We got to find you
a new school.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.287
We can talk about it
tomorrow, okay?

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.965
It's going to be
okay, monkey.

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.880
Can I...
Can I talk to him for a second?

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.567
Six rules.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.006
And listen up,
because I don't know

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.528
if I'm gonna be able to
tell you this again, okay?

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.369
These are from my father.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.288
Number one.
If you like something

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.647
because you think
other people are gonna like it,

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.649
it's a sure bet
no one will.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:49.604
Number two.
Most doors in the world are closed,

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:52.485
so if you find one
that you want to get into,

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.728
you damn well better have
an interesting knock.

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.770
And if you knock
like you drum, you'll be fine.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:02.561
Number three.
Everything that you think is important

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.404
isn't.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.089
And everything that
you think is unimportant is.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.405
Number four.
Don't shit where you eat.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.045
I wasn't planning on it.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.645
He meant that
metaphorically, of course.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:21.643
Now, bear in mind
my father was not all that successful.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:24.491
Number five.
Lean into it.

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.766
What does that mean?

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.410
It means that the outcome
doesn't matter.

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.926
What matters is
that you're there for it.

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.411
Whatever "it" is,
good or bad.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.889
Kind of like right now.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.644
And finally, number six,
a personal favorite.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.127
Never sleep with someone who
has more problems than you.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.361
Hey!

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.485
And my very own.
Always assume your mother's listening.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.968
That is definitely a rule.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.885
Your mom is
always listening.

01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.091
So those are the rules.

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:01.806
Thanks, man.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.766
Good luck, champ.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.961
Sleep.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.521
We have to...

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.405
Please don't go.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.724
I just...

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.689
Oh, God,
I'm a horrible person.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.007
He)'

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.722
I want you to stay with us.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.842
- Please don't.
- It's okay.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.166
I've heard everything.

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:59.684
Come on. Relapses, jail,
I've heard everything.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.010
I'm scared, too.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:04.920
We'll figure it out.

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.205
You are going
to hate me.

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.528
How do you know
what I'm going to feel, huh?

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.887
Are you me?

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.565
Yeah...

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.201
Sort of.

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.721
I'm his son.

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.722
Jerry, he's my father.

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.807
He asked me
to give you the money.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:39.571
I wanted to tell you.
I should have told you.

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:40.727
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:46.484
- Frankie, I am so sorry.
- Get out. Get out.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.683
Get out. Get out.
Get out. Get out!

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.201
Get out of my house!
Get out!

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.484
I'm going. Okay.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.601
Get out!

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:56.649
I'm okay.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.963
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry you had to see that.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.324
Are you okay?

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:11.527
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm okay, we're okay, honey. We're okay.

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.281
Thanks.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.011
Hi, Carol.

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.523
<i>If this is redemption</i>

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.241
<i>Why do I bother at all?</i>

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.562
<i>There's nothing to mention</i>

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.010
<i>And nothing has changed</i>

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.730
<i>Still I'd rather be</i>
<i>working for something</i>

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.291
<i>Than praying for the rain</i>

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.844
<i>So I wander on</i>
<i>till someone else is saved</i>

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.044
<i>Me I was holding</i>

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:26.484
<i>All of my secrets</i>
<i>soft and hid</i>

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.722
<i>Pages were folded</i>
<i>then there was nothing at all</i>

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.720
Um, sit wherever you want.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.607
<i>If in the future</i>
<i>I might need myself a savior</i>

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:48.241
<i>I'll remember</i>
<i>what was written on that wall</i>

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:56.090
<i>That we don't eat until</i>
<i>your father's at the table</i>

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:04.209
<i>We don't drink until</i>
<i>the devil's turned to dust</i>

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:12.964
<i>Never once has any man</i>
<i>I've met been able to love</i>

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:19.327
<i>So if I were you</i>
<i>I'd have a little trust</i>

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.562
<i>Hey, it's Hannah. Leave a message.</i>

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.328
Hey, Han, it's me.

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:31.249
My mom's going
into Cedars tomorrow.

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:37.125
Cedars is a...
It's not a forest, it's a hospital.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.288
<i>It's just for this,</i>
<i>uh, well...</i>

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:43.284
<i>It's supposed to be</i>
<i>for this outpatient procedure.</i>

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:46.245
<i>It's not an emergency</i>
<i>or anything.</i>

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.891
<i>But I just thought</i>
<i>I'd tell you that.</i>

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.205
I also really wanted
to tell you that I'm...

01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.805
<i>If you're happy with your message,</i>

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:00.847
<i>press one.</i>

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.843
<i>To delete this message,</i>
<i>press two.</i>

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:11.362
<i>So if in the future</i>
<i>I might need myself a savior</i>

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:17.321
<i>I'll remember what</i>
<i>was written on that wall</i>

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.768
You can wait downstairs.
It shouldn't be too long.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.080
All right.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.843
I'll be here
when you get out, okay?

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.321
Okay.

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.288
Oh, would you take these?

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.440
Finish your sentence.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.291
What's the other reason
you were calling?

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.769
I'm sorry about everything.

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:09.041
I'm sorry.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.486
I love you.

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:21.124
Sweetie, you look like
all kinds of shit.

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:27.808
I told her.
I gave her the money.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.845
I knew you would.

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:34.444
You're not coming
back, are you?

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.924
Well, that may be up to
the fine people

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.570
at the Federal
Trade Commission.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.001
It's a good thing
you're going to be a lawyer.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.411
I'm gonna need one.

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:49.323
I will dig my way out,
one mess at a time.

01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:53.123
But this is where
I'm supposed to be.

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.524
I'm not worried
about you anymore.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.362
Or as worried.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.802
I was thinking maybe
you could stay.

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.129
I got into NYU.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.084
Han, that's...
That's great!

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:18.010
Congratulations.
That's wonderful.

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.363
I'm happy for you.

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.566
And UCLA.

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:33.249
I knew you'd turn out to be
a halfway-decent guy.

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.441
Mom?

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.326
Mom?

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:16.241
You okay?

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.564
I made him choose.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.045
And he chose us.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.529
Marriage, Sam.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.202
Well, you're going
to find out.

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.728
I didn't think
it would turn out this way.

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:46.645
I don't know...
If I hadn't have done it,

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:48.290
I don't know that
things would have

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:51.170
turned out any better.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:55.089
Maybe there'd be
another family. And another.

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.724
Well, he made up his mind.

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:08.409
I wasn't going to let him ruin the
one thing I had created.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.080
The only thing
that made sense.

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:14.966
You.

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:21.206
But it didn't really
work out that way, did it?

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:25.250
Every time he looked at me,
he must have seen Frankie.

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.491
He saw what he gave up.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.242
I would have
avoided me, too.

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.761
I hope you never
have to know what it's like

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.286
to love someone

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.966
and then find out
you're not enough.

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:48.610
I was trying to protect you
from ever feeling that.

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:54.086
Don't you think
I believed I was flying to your defense

01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:58.006
with all the courage
in my heart?

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.563
You're my son, Sam.
My son.

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.804
It was the only thing
I could do.

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.441
I'm not sure if we're ever
going to agree on that.

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:30.326
But I love you.

01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.720
I guess

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:47.603
maybe we could both
start trying to be...

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:49.687
Be people.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.606
Be People!

01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:01.081
I told him
it was my fault

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.091
that you were always
so far away, and he said,

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.603
"Just watch.
Sam's going to surprise you."

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.247
Oh.

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:45.407
I think this is
meant for you.

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:30.800
Come on, man,
it's her last check.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:31.801
She must have left something.

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.644
A forwarding address,
a phone number?

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.888
Look, man. I don't
know what to tell you. She just quit.

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.325
Our course materials
are designed

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.971
with the career-oriented
student in mind.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.329
Our first semester
covers landscaping

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:48.209
in the age of technology,

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:52.370
pricing your proposed design,
interior plant-soaping,

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:56.690
and understanding
what the client wants.

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.522
Josh, your records
are in the living room.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.806
All right.

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.806
Okay.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.970
- Last one.
- I love it. I'll take it.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.691
You want some help
getting these in?

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.489
No, you did
enough already.

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.891
- Whatever.
- Thanks so much.

01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.849
Okay, so,
dinner Thursday.

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.330
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.209
- Baked ziti.
- Sure. Whatever that is.

01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.882
<i>This is what I call</i>
<i>a healthy meal.</i>

01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.689
Oh!

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.802
<i>All right. Let me hear</i>
<i>Keith Moon! Keith Moon!</i>

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:03.802
Well, that was quite a knock.
Is it Halloween?

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.121
Is Sam home?

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.006
No. He's out.
Who are you?

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:12.807
I'm Josh.

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:27.926
Lillian.

01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:31.005
Um...

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:32.605
Can I leave him a note?

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:55.571
Josh! Enough chips.
We're having dinner.

01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:59.167
But it's sour cream and onion.
It's like milk and vegetables.

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.246
Give me one.

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.844
You did this?

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.285
Mom.

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.365
You need to talk to him.

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:20.045
Just lean into it, man.

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:26.721
What do you want?

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:27.881
I came to tell you
how sorry I am.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.970
The one guy taking
interest in my kid and it had to be you.

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:33.930
And you lied
about recovering. Who does that?

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.081
- That is sacred!
- I know.

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:38.369
No, you don't know.
I let you in.

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:41.402
You humiliated me.

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.807
Please. Just go.

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.285
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.964
I never meant
to do that, Frankie.

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:50.770
Please, let me tell you this.
Let me show you something.

01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.811
If you never want
to see me again,

01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.006
I completely understand.

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:58.330
Just don't turn your back
on me. Just listen. Please.

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.451
Why did you do this to me?

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.888
- I was scared.
- Of what?

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.128
Of you! Of everything!

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:08.849
Six weeks ago
I had no idea you existed,

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:10.285
and there you were.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.764
And I needed the money.
You know?

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:15.161
I was selfish.
I was a coward.

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:20.320
I was scared of this.
I don't know how to do this.

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:23.969
We're the only two people
on this planet

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.962
that know what it was like
to be his kid.

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:28.131
You and me.
That's it.

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.168
That's like...
It's, uh...

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:32.971
It's a miracle or something.
I mean, it is. It's a miracle.

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:36.205
How am I ever supposed
to trust you?

01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:43.491
Because...

01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.405
Because we're family.

01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:54.726
And families make mistakes,
and I am the king of mistakes.

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:00.929
I'm asking you
to forgive me.

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.163
And I know it's a lot.
I just...

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.365
Let me be your brother.

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.040
I am your brother.

01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:15.405
I want you
to be my sister.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.240
It's all I want.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.002
I left the money
on the table, you know.

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.531
I got all the way
to the elevator and I realized

01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:38.525
I couldn't do it to Josh.

01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:41.211
So I took it.

01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.408
He deserves more than
what we had.

01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:52.811
I think that I waited
my whole life

01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:56.042
for him to come back to me.

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.885
He sent you.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.004
He wanted
to come back.

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.562
You said he used to
take you on picnics?

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:34.927
Yeah.

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:39.126
Your mom
kept taking you after he left.

01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:41.921
Yeah.

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.602
Can I show you
something, please?

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:11.010
<i>I'm taking all</i>
<i>my dreams with me</i>

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:20.489
<i>On a mattress</i>
<i>full of memories</i>

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:29.764
<i>I'm taking all</i>
<i>my dreams with me</i>

01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:49.445
<i>And if anyone asks you</i>
<i>where I've been</i>

01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:57.406
<i>I've been out having fun</i>
<i>with my friends again</i>

01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:02.281
<i>We're dancing real close</i>
<i>but you can always cut in</i>

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.843
<i>We'll be dancing real close</i>
<i>but you can always cut in</i>

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:12.882
<i>'Cause I signed</i>
<i>on the dotted line</i>

01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:21.765
<i>And that mess</i>
<i>on your plate is mine</i>

01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:32.725
<i>And I ain't asking you</i>
<i>to trust me</i>

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:36.087
<i>Anymore</i>

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:40.449
<i>I'm trusting you</i>

01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:44.969
<i>And I say it enough</i>

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:59.963
<i>We never had a chance</i>

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:05.285
<i>To watch out for one another</i>

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:10.127
<i>We both need that</i>

01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:14.762
<i>It's hard when a friend</i>
<i>turns their back</i>

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:19.289
<i>But when you turned around</i>

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:23.689
<i>I knew I'd finally found</i>

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:29.085
<i>Someone whose heart</i>
<i>beats the same</i>

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:31.606
<i>I don't remember too much</i>

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:38.449
<i>But I remember the day that</i>
<i>I signed on the dotted line</i>

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:49.686
<i>And that name</i>
<i>next to yours is mine</i>

01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:59.965
<i>And I ain't asking you</i>
<i>to trust me</i>

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:03.201
<i>This time</i>

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:07.524
<i>I'm trusting you</i>

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:12.527
<i>And I say it enough</i>
