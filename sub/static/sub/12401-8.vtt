                 No. The RC car

00:06.707 --> 00:08.039
                    on the left.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.274
                Huh?

00:09.276 --> 00:11.377
                Your other left!

00:11.379 --> 00:12.711
                    Oh.

00:16.616 --> 00:18.183
          Nice choice.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.853
     She's a beauty.

00:20.855 --> 00:21.987
       There we go.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.123
      Oh. No, I'm sorry.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.291
       You don't have
       enough points.

00:26.293 --> 00:29.962
    But you can have anything
    from here to there.

00:29.964 --> 00:32.398
               Come on,
               don't be a dick.

00:33.466 --> 00:36.135
    Look, I'm sorry,
    but I have to go

00:36.137 --> 00:38.737
  with what's on the receipt.
  Rules are rules.

00:38.739 --> 00:42.641
              Just... forget it.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.943
        We'll just get some of
        those plastic handcuffs.

00:46.379 --> 00:47.913
Oh, there you go.

00:47.915 --> 00:52.084
You can play by the rules
and still have fun.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.519
          Here.

00:53.521 --> 00:56.155
    Here's a few tokens
    on the house.

00:57.323 --> 00:58.891

01:57.718 --> 01:59.885
   I brought a treat for you.

01:59.887 --> 02:00.953
           Huh?

02:06.226 --> 02:07.359
             Yeah.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.162
Oh, it's all right.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.965
It's all right, yeah.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.101
             There.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.570

             Well, good mornin'!

04:14.688 --> 04:17.422
   I'm placing you
   under arrest for assault.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.558
   Come on down here
   and keep them hands
   where I can see.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.860
You have the right
to remain silent.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.629
Any shit you do say
can and will be used

04:23.631 --> 04:25.530
 against you in a court of law.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.199
       You have a right
       to an attorney.

04:27.201 --> 04:30.302
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

04:30.304 --> 04:33.305
Do you understand these rights
that I have just read to you?

04:34.974 --> 04:38.677

05:37.670 --> 05:39.371
You wanna sulk, fine.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.206
Try and act normal
around Holly.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.943
She's not an idiot.
         No, she's not.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.679
        You don't think
        she saw you sleeping
        on the couch last night?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.382
Just like she never notices
when you won't talk
to me for days,

05:50.384 --> 05:52.317
   'cause I gave you
   too much attitude.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.786
      I didn't realize
      this was a contest, Megan.
It's not.

05:54.788 --> 05:55.887
                  All right,
                  you know what?
                  You win.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.989
                 Right or wrong,
                 you always win.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.730
          Why are we letting him
          do this to us?

06:06.165 --> 06:09.134
   Donnie's not the problem.

06:10.803 --> 06:14.272
  He is a piece-of-shit rapist
  who got what he deserved.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.743
       Look, Megan,
       we gotta talk about this.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.547
         Nothin'?

06:49.208 --> 06:50.942
Well, good mornin',
little lady.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.544
Are those for me?

06:52.546 --> 06:53.745
    They're for my grandma.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.580
Well, they're very pretty.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.582
                   Hey, Firefly,

06:57.584 --> 06:59.584
             breakfast is ready.

07:05.224 --> 07:09.261
Amber, uh, just use
a lot of ketchup.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.430
          Uh-oh.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.931
            Is your wife here?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.933
Uh, she was.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.102
         Well, that's
         a positive development.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.737
         We'll see.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.006
How was the turnout
at service this mornin'?

07:22.308 --> 07:24.609
          They'll be back.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.044
       Is he there?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.746
Jesus, come on, Rev.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.848
Didn't you do enough damage
the other night?

07:31.584 --> 07:33.618
        I want him to see me
        on my feet.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.620
       For him to know
       that I've beat the count.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.755
           Round two.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.491
You really think
he's the devil?

07:39.493 --> 07:41.460
              You saw
              what he did to me.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.128
     Yeah, I did.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.564
You made sure
everybody saw that.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.066
           What? You-- you think
           I did this to myself?

07:48.068 --> 07:50.101
If he is,
then why is he goin'

07:50.103 --> 07:52.571
and showin' himself like that?
               I don't know!
               Let's go ask him!

07:53.606 --> 07:55.073
He's gone, Rev.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.510
Giles came by
first thing this mornin'.

07:58.512 --> 07:59.945
Took him off
in his squad car.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.480
               No!

08:01.482 --> 08:04.783
     No! Goddamn it,
     he's giving him
     exactly what he wants!

08:04.785 --> 08:06.785
                   What are
                   you gonna do?

08:06.787 --> 08:09.087
                           Rev.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.022
           Rev!
         (engine revs)

08:18.965 --> 08:20.632
                 AARON: (laughs)

08:20.634 --> 08:22.100
          What's that?

08:22.102 --> 08:23.335
                 My buddy, Jake.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.604
       He was at the memorial...
    ANDERSON: (yelling)

08:25.606 --> 08:28.507
                ...and he filmed
                the whole thing
                on his phone.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.942
                It's priceless.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.611
               Hey, that's mine.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.846
 You get it back
 once I delete this.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.349
                 Hey, good luck.

08:37.351 --> 08:40.150
         It's already out there.

08:40.153 --> 08:43.955
John has protected us
in ways you'll never understand.

08:43.957 --> 08:47.492
           You know,
           the whole town knows.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.794
                  You're gossip.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.630
                  The town slut.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.739
Did you paint
that horrible symbol
on the statue?

09:00.741 --> 09:01.873
                I did it.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.542
               It was me!

09:03.544 --> 09:05.310
              Hail Satan!

09:08.548 --> 09:10.549
I love you so much.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.520
       You are so smart.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.323
             What are you doing?
And you can be so kind.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.858
               What do you want?

09:19.860 --> 09:24.329
All I've ever wanted
is for you to be happy.

09:24.331 --> 09:27.465
Can't you just want that
for me, too?

09:36.042 --> 09:37.943
                 ANDERSON:
                 I told you not
                 to do anythin'.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.278
GILES:
The man assaulted you.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.081
And that's all he is,
by the way, a man.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.382
              You keep him here,

09:44.384 --> 09:46.718
            just gonna make
            the situation worse.
     How?

09:46.720 --> 09:49.187
        Crazy Anderson attacks
        a poor, defenseless man.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.855
             It's Martyrdom 101.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.857
         You're just handing him
         the ammunition to build
         a following.

09:52.859 --> 09:56.795
Look, now,
we've done it your way
for quite some time now,

09:56.797 --> 09:58.863
and I don't see the situation
getting much better.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.899
In fact, your little show
proves to me

10:00.901 --> 10:02.567
that I need to get up
on out of the backseat.

10:02.569 --> 10:05.737
         Now, that's your bigger
         plan of action, right?

10:05.739 --> 10:07.305
    I mean, hell,
    you can't arrest all of 'em.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.075
If it helps
to keep the town safe,
I can sure as hell try.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.443
     It's his word against mine!

10:11.445 --> 10:14.212
Oh, I can find some people
who will swear they witnessed

10:14.214 --> 10:16.281
him assaulting you
if it comes to that.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.150
        And they made you chief.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.789
Look, Johnny.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.294
I want to know
who this son of a bitch is.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.796
It's like he just--
         Came down from the sky.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.099
Well, now, you can give him
any name you want.

10:34.101 --> 10:37.168
To me, he's a perp
until I hear different.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.037
That's just how
I'm gonna treat him.

10:42.408 --> 10:47.312
 You know, this used to happen
 once or twice a year,

10:47.314 --> 10:51.049
but lately,
it's happening too often.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.386
And to people I know.

10:58.457 --> 10:59.658
        (sighs)

10:59.660 --> 11:01.526
                 Is there anyone
                 in particular?

11:03.929 --> 11:06.598
              <i> ¶ ¶</i>

11:12.872 --> 11:16.441
     Her hair's more gray
     than last time.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.777
                  Yeah, well...

11:20.546 --> 11:23.281
            we haven't been here
            in a while, and...

11:23.283 --> 11:25.083
            that's what happens.

11:27.453 --> 11:30.588
Amber, why don't you come
have a seat? Uh...

11:34.060 --> 11:36.227
Gotta explain
something to you.

11:42.068 --> 11:44.202
    So...

11:44.204 --> 11:45.804
     uh...

11:45.806 --> 11:48.406
You remember that day
with your mom?

11:48.408 --> 11:50.842
Well, the same thing happened

11:50.844 --> 11:54.479
with me and my mom
a long time ago.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.283
Something got inside
of her, and...

12:01.654 --> 12:05.523
and it scared me,
like I know it scared you.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.058
But that wasn't her.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.729
And, baby,
it wasn't your fault.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.363
I want you
to understand that, okay?

12:12.365 --> 12:14.165
  It wasn't your fault.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.370
 Is Momma going to be like that?

12:19.372 --> 12:22.107
       Maybe that would be okay.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.243
         No, baby.

12:27.546 --> 12:30.348
      She's not ever gonna
      hurt us again, okay?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.817
      She loves both of us
      more than anything.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.188
Why don't you go put
them pretty flowers
in a vase for your grandma?

12:38.891 --> 12:41.292
          Then we can give her
          a funny hairdo.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.696
What do
I do with these?

12:44.698 --> 12:46.331
                     Hm?

12:54.373 --> 12:56.441
          Excuse me.
                    Hm?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.743
Has somebody been in
to visit my mother,
Sarah Barnes?

12:58.745 --> 13:00.311
                 Um...

13:00.313 --> 13:03.581
         someone came by
         for her a few days ago.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.918
          Who?
                I don't remember
                his name. Um...

13:06.920 --> 13:10.755
            he... showed up
            with a box of candy.

13:10.757 --> 13:13.992
     I told him there was no use
     giving them to your mother,

13:13.994 --> 13:15.894
           so he left them
           for the staff to eat.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.929
      White hair?
                          Maybe.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.165
              Uh, he wore a hat.

14:29.835 --> 14:31.803
           (knocking)

14:34.540 --> 14:38.509
            (knocks harder)
Jesus! Don't bang it down!

14:38.511 --> 14:40.211
                 Sorry.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.113
Oh, my God.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.315
Hi, sweetie.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.917
        Hi, Aunt Megan!

14:48.554 --> 14:49.988
You know what?

14:49.990 --> 14:51.990
Holly is in the kitchen.

14:51.992 --> 14:55.159
  Why don't you two girls go
  and play in the backyard?

14:55.161 --> 14:56.761
     Thank you.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.330
  What have you done?

14:59.332 --> 15:01.432
        I didn't-- Why is that
        the first thing you ask?

15:01.434 --> 15:03.701
Well, because--
       Allison brought her over.

15:03.703 --> 15:04.903
          They stayed the night.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.238
Are you guys...

15:07.240 --> 15:08.840
  I mean--
              No, no, no.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.842
She didn't want
anything to do with you.

15:12.011 --> 15:14.946
            Yeah, well, that
            may still be true.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.414
         I woke up
         and Allison was gone.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.750
 Should I tell Mark? Um--
                  No, no, no.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.119
        But will you watch Amber
        for this afternoon?

15:21.121 --> 15:22.587
     Yeah.
               I gotta take care
               of somethin'.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.088
   What?

15:24.090 --> 15:26.591
                 I'll be back
                 in a few hours
                 to pick her up.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.327
Does this have something
to do with Anderson?

15:31.230 --> 15:32.397
                  Not exactly.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.399
That man is mentally unstable.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.467
Seriously, don't let him
drag you down with him.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.802
            I got it, okay?

15:37.804 --> 15:39.370
              Don't worry.

15:40.806 --> 15:41.906
               Thank you.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.274
         Sure.

15:52.418 --> 15:54.852
                      Oh, great.

16:01.560 --> 16:05.063
     (music plays on radio)

16:06.598 --> 16:07.999
             You need some help?

16:08.001 --> 16:09.567
      Oh, I'm just gonna
      call Lenny,

16:09.569 --> 16:11.436
       have him come
       change it for me.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.104
          Who knows
          how long that'll take?

16:13.106 --> 16:14.138
            You know him.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.306
             Where you wanna go?

16:16.275 --> 16:17.442
        I'll be fine.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.277
          Thank you.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.179
         I understand.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.014
      Don't wanna be seen
      hoppin' in the car

16:23.016 --> 16:26.017
         with the...
         town lunatic.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.085
           (chuckles)

16:27.087 --> 16:30.154
Well, it had crossed my mind.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.657
           You'd be helping
           salvage my reputation

16:32.659 --> 16:34.892
           if you were to let me
           do you a good turn.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.062
I don't know, Reverend.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.399
            Come on.

16:43.035 --> 16:44.335
         All right.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.413
                    GILES:
                    Kyle Barnes.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.616
          As I live and breathe.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.621
I need to talk to Sidney.

17:03.623 --> 17:04.955
                  About what?

17:06.224 --> 17:07.458
Reverend sent me.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.328
                  Is that right?

17:10.329 --> 17:13.064
             And what is it that
             the Reverend asked
             you to do?

17:15.501 --> 17:18.202
He needs to know
if he's one of 'em,

17:18.204 --> 17:19.971
like your friend's wife.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.807
               Really.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.977
        I thought he had
        already decided

17:25.979 --> 17:28.479
       that this one was
       the devil himself.

17:30.182 --> 17:32.583
I just need to talk to him,
ask him questions.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.786
         He's not talking, Kyle.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.489
I think he'll talk to me.

17:40.592 --> 17:41.759
          (door opens)

17:41.761 --> 17:43.094
         (door closes)

18:17.863 --> 18:19.764
                    (door opens)

18:19.766 --> 18:20.965
                  (door closes)

18:20.967 --> 18:22.767
How do you know
my mother?

18:24.570 --> 18:26.771
              I don't know
              your mother, Kyle.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.307
          I never met the lady
          before I came to town.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.376
Why are you
bringing her flowers?

18:32.378 --> 18:34.612
        I heard a lot about her.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.449
            They say she put up
            one hell of a fight.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.355
You ain't seen a fight yet.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.626
          How often do you go
          see your mother, Kyle?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.461
                   Once a month?

18:50.463 --> 18:53.464
            Christmas? Birthday?

18:53.466 --> 18:56.167
       You drag your little girl
       along if you remember to?

18:58.303 --> 19:01.405
          She's been
          in that bed for years,

19:01.407 --> 19:02.740
   ever since you put her there.

19:03.742 --> 19:05.276
           (grunts)

19:05.278 --> 19:06.344
   Who are you?

19:07.846 --> 19:09.614
I'll take you right out
of this man, I swear.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.015
I've done it before.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.950
                 And you've hurt
                 a lot of people
                 in the process.

19:12.952 --> 19:13.985
         (grunts)
                (yelps)

19:13.987 --> 19:15.286
                Aah!
           (sizzling)

19:15.288 --> 19:17.455
Difference is, I don't give
a shit about you.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.157
                   (grunts)

19:19.159 --> 19:22.093
      You take this out of me...

19:22.095 --> 19:24.562
           you will leave behind
           a monster.

19:27.966 --> 19:30.368

19:40.045 --> 19:42.713

19:42.715 --> 19:44.215
                 (grunts)

19:51.990 --> 19:54.625
              <i> ¶ ¶</i>

20:22.221 --> 20:24.322
    SIDNEY:
    You don't get to choose.

20:24.324 --> 20:29.393
     The saints are just as
     susceptible as the sinners.

20:29.395 --> 20:34.565
So, someone's just
walking down the street one day,

20:34.567 --> 20:36.267
and all of a sudden,
there you are,

20:36.269 --> 20:38.236
lookin' through their eyes?

20:40.205 --> 20:42.440
      You land where you land...

20:44.076 --> 20:47.745
      <i> and I wound up</i>
      <i> with a real winner.</i>

20:51.883 --> 20:55.353
                   (coughing)

21:00.792 --> 21:03.127
   If it's random,
   like you say...

21:04.730 --> 21:06.864
then why does it happen
to people around me?

21:07.933 --> 21:10.368
                You're like a...

21:10.370 --> 21:12.703
                 like a match...

21:12.705 --> 21:15.439
    flickering through the trees
    of a dark forest.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.776
           It gives us something
           to grope toward.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.114
  I'm causing this?

21:23.116 --> 21:24.815
             We'd have found
             our way eventually.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.884
        You just make it easier.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.887
           (coughing)

21:32.324 --> 21:33.991
      (groans)

21:38.630 --> 21:39.864
            (gasps)

21:43.969 --> 21:45.202
      <i> (jazz music playing)</i>

22:02.921 --> 22:04.588
             BOY:
             Help!

22:08.794 --> 22:10.561
           Somebody!

22:13.765 --> 22:15.266
                 Please help me!

22:17.936 --> 22:19.370
         (door rattles)

22:21.273 --> 22:22.773
                        Help me!

22:24.876 --> 22:26.277
                         Please!

22:32.484 --> 22:33.684
       Is that...

22:35.887 --> 22:38.155
Is that what happened
to my mother?

22:38.157 --> 22:41.092
          'Til you ripped
          half of her away.

22:42.828 --> 22:45.129
                I know you tried
                to help her,

22:45.131 --> 22:46.831
            but it was too late.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.866
       If you'd just let her be,

22:48.868 --> 22:51.068
               they'd have found
               a way to coexist.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.404
           She'd be in your life
           right now.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.974
       As what?

22:58.710 --> 23:01.679
Half my mother and half...

23:01.681 --> 23:04.448
        Isn't that better than
        what you have now, Kyle?

23:06.418 --> 23:09.620
             A dribbling,
             lifeless vegetable?

23:10.722 --> 23:12.156
You know,
if I hadn't fought back,

23:12.158 --> 23:14.759
my mother might have
killed me that day.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.727
And if I hadn't stopped
Allison, she--

23:16.729 --> 23:18.596
              Like I said,

23:18.598 --> 23:21.732
            those first few days
            can be rough.

23:29.441 --> 23:30.775
     This'll just take a minute.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.610
   Take me to the firehouse.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.878
                         I will.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.247
        Told you, I just gotta
        make a quick stop first.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.682
Church business.
Why don't you come in with me?

23:38.684 --> 23:40.518
                 I'll wait here.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.187
  Come on, I think you'll get
  a kick out of it.

23:46.691 --> 23:48.259
                Who lives here?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.961
          Kyle Barnes.

23:57.202 --> 23:58.269
             (grunts)

24:09.047 --> 24:10.281
           Get in!

24:14.820 --> 24:16.053
                      Get in!

24:49.120 --> 24:50.721
How many more of you?

24:52.023 --> 24:54.158
      Hundreds?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.660
Thousands?

24:56.662 --> 24:58.395
What is his plan?

24:59.698 --> 25:01.999
Why does he need
these souls, your soul?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.734
Why now?

25:06.171 --> 25:07.738
        I have a theory!

25:09.307 --> 25:11.942
    The Apostle Paul...

25:11.944 --> 25:15.279
said in later times,
some abandon their faith...

25:16.815 --> 25:19.350
and follow deceiving spirits.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.952
Do you know what
I mean by later times?
Of course you do!

25:21.954 --> 25:24.221
End times!

25:24.223 --> 25:26.724
The Apocalypse!

25:26.726 --> 25:28.392
That's why he's here,
isn't it?

25:29.528 --> 25:31.762
Preparing the Great Tribulation.

25:40.705 --> 25:44.508
        You're focusin'
        on the negative,
        Debbie Downer.

25:44.510 --> 25:45.809
                 Famines...

25:45.811 --> 25:49.914
      plagues, false messiahs.

25:49.916 --> 25:53.918
But the end of days means
that the real deal is returning.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.854
                 Right?

25:56.856 --> 26:01.158
  You been screechin' about it
  on Sunday mornin' for years.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.328
     "Jesus is coming!
     Everybody look busy!"

26:05.897 --> 26:08.165
      So, why are you so scared?

26:09.234 --> 26:11.402
     You should be tickled pink.

26:13.838 --> 26:17.107
    Unless you don't believe
    it's true.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.256
     Whew.

26:32.258 --> 26:35.526
I heard you arrested
that old white-haired guy?

26:35.528 --> 26:38.596
The one Anderson
went ape-shit on
at Remembrance Day?

26:38.598 --> 26:42.633
        Let me guess, you're his
        legal representation.

26:42.635 --> 26:46.303
Well, I can get him out,
if that's what you're askin'.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.039
                  I'm intrigued.

26:51.476 --> 26:53.777
I was at the church,

26:53.779 --> 26:57.815
and I saw the Reverend carve
that pentagram on himself.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.684
And that guy you busted,
he wasn't even there.

27:04.255 --> 27:06.991
       Why would the Reverend do
       that to himself?

27:08.059 --> 27:10.327
     Why do you think?

27:10.329 --> 27:13.397
'Cause he's a little man,
with a crappy little church.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.666
Now he's got
everybody talkin' about him.

27:15.668 --> 27:18.102
         Why are you doing this?

27:18.104 --> 27:20.504
Well, I'm tellin' the truth.

27:22.007 --> 27:24.241
                Look, son.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.844
     I know this whole situation
     can't be easy on you,

27:26.846 --> 27:30.014
     but your mother has a right
     to a life of her own.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.750
      If I have to testify,
      I will.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.251
  Who are they gonna believe?

27:34.253 --> 27:37.354
Anderson's lost his mind.
Everyone knows it.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.923
He's over at Kyle Barnes' place
with some woman right now.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.592
He's probably rapin' her
or somethin'.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.895
          What woman?

28:20.999 --> 28:22.833
                   Jesus Christ.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.468
ANDERSON:
Kyle.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.803
Been waitin' for you.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.137
KYLE:
What did you do?

28:27.139 --> 28:29.406
              You both are gonna
              pay for this.

28:29.408 --> 28:30.974
               Take it easy.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.676
        No one's gonna hurt you.

28:32.678 --> 28:34.511
                   That's right.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.080
           Once we're done here,

28:36.082 --> 28:38.682
 all your suffering
 will be over.

28:38.684 --> 28:39.983
          LENNY:
          Where is he?

28:39.985 --> 28:42.686
           I went by the church.
           He's not there.

28:42.688 --> 28:45.422
               I've been drivin'
               all over town!
   Lenny, Lenny, slow down.

28:45.424 --> 28:48.092
            I found Kat's car
            with a tire slashed.
Lenny, get in the car.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.193
      Get in the car!

28:49.195 --> 28:50.994
     Get in the damn car, Lenny!

28:56.568 --> 28:59.269
Judy at the hardware store
said Anderson picked her up.
            Lenny--

28:59.271 --> 29:01.238
That son of a bitch
kidnapped my wife!
            Lenny--

29:01.240 --> 29:03.373
      Lenny, now
      she's gonna be all right.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.609
You know about this?

29:05.611 --> 29:08.445
   All I know is that
   he's just trying to help.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.248
      We don't want any help!
      We're fine just as we are!

29:11.250 --> 29:12.683
Lenny, stop. Lenny!

29:14.619 --> 29:16.153
Okay.

29:18.056 --> 29:19.089
       (exhales)

29:19.091 --> 29:20.290
       All right.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.328
Now, when did it all start?

29:26.264 --> 29:28.031
      Summer before last.

29:30.401 --> 29:32.202
Up at the cabin.

29:33.138 --> 29:34.204
             (sighs)

29:34.206 --> 29:36.774
    At first, I--
    I thought she was sick.

29:38.076 --> 29:40.077
     But I-- I couldn't get
     her in the car,

29:40.079 --> 29:41.612
       and I didn't know
       what to do.

29:44.048 --> 29:46.350
     After a while,
     she seemed to be okay.

29:48.486 --> 29:50.354
   More than okay.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.159
                    Oh.

29:55.161 --> 29:58.162
    What does that camper
    in the woods have to do
    with anything?

29:59.464 --> 30:02.900
       When it happens,
       the-- the change,

30:02.902 --> 30:04.735
     they can hurt
     themselves or others.

30:04.737 --> 30:08.238
   They... they need a place
   to ride it out.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.706
"They"?

30:10.942 --> 30:13.043
           Well, how many
           of them are there?

30:14.412 --> 30:17.681
Half a dozen.
                Jesus Christ.

30:17.683 --> 30:21.185
Last one was
that gal Lisa Peyton.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.786
She... (chuckles)

30:22.788 --> 30:25.222
     <i> ...damn near destroyed</i>
     <i> the thing.</i>
     (rattling, clattering)

30:26.991 --> 30:28.525
          Lenny...

30:29.761 --> 30:31.962
       Why don't you let
       the Reverend help?

30:31.964 --> 30:34.164
              Maybe he can bring
              her back.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.667
I don't want her back!

30:38.636 --> 30:40.003
                  God.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.272
I don't mean it that way.

30:42.274 --> 30:45.209
    I mean, Kat is still
    in there somewhere.

30:46.978 --> 30:50.180
And now everything's...
different, exciting.

30:52.217 --> 30:53.283
She...

30:54.319 --> 30:55.819
        tastes things...

30:55.821 --> 30:58.188
        like they're...

30:58.190 --> 31:00.123
    like they're brand-new.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.727
     Can you imagine that?

31:03.729 --> 31:06.396
    Your-- your first beer?

31:06.398 --> 31:10.334
       Your first fight,
       Your first fuck...

31:10.336 --> 31:12.636
       all over again?

31:16.307 --> 31:17.574
       Lenny.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.243
              Please?

31:20.745 --> 31:24.915
   That woman that I woke up
   next to this morning...

31:26.985 --> 31:30.654
 she's the one I want to spend
 the rest of my life with.

31:33.358 --> 31:34.958
ANDERSON:
What are you waitin' for?

31:36.327 --> 31:38.428
This is what
we have to do.

31:39.497 --> 31:40.731
       Why?

31:40.733 --> 31:42.833
            She's not a monster.

31:42.835 --> 31:45.269
                Her family sees
                the same person
                they always saw.

31:45.271 --> 31:48.872
        And what becomes of
        the real Kat Ogden, huh,

31:48.874 --> 31:52.943
                 and not this...
                 perversion?

31:52.945 --> 31:54.211
It's not how it works.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.313
                 Kat Ogden is...

31:57.548 --> 31:58.982
                 still in there.

32:00.218 --> 32:01.285
How do you know?

32:01.287 --> 32:03.654
           He knows.

32:04.722 --> 32:06.757
     He knows what we are.

32:11.029 --> 32:12.296
                       How?

32:14.799 --> 32:16.466
            You've been talkin'
            to him, haven't you?

32:17.402 --> 32:18.902
That's not how it is.

32:18.904 --> 32:20.771
     No, you've been lettin' him
     get inside of your head...

32:21.806 --> 32:23.106
    because that's what he does.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.309
You think you know
what this is about.

32:25.311 --> 32:26.743
Reverend, I'm telling you.
You're wrong.

32:26.745 --> 32:27.911
                         Fine.

32:27.913 --> 32:30.547
      Why don't you
      talk me through it?

32:30.549 --> 32:32.649
I mean, what are
we up against here?

32:32.651 --> 32:37.587
 What is it inside of her, huh?

32:37.589 --> 32:41.959
Look, until we know,
we gotta let it be.

32:41.961 --> 32:44.227
For now, okay?

32:54.105 --> 32:55.806
                     Come on.

32:55.808 --> 32:57.240
             I'll take you home.

32:57.242 --> 32:58.842
                (grunts)
         (screams)

32:58.844 --> 33:00.243
                      No, stop!

33:01.646 --> 33:03.146
         What the hell
         is the matter with you?

33:03.148 --> 33:05.482
          You saw how he turned
          the people against me!

33:05.484 --> 33:06.616
       They were laughin' at me!

33:06.618 --> 33:08.251
       Now, if-- if I can
       bring her back,

33:08.253 --> 33:10.187
   they'll be packing
   my church every week!

33:10.189 --> 33:11.855
  Every week!

33:13.858 --> 33:15.492
             I'm sorry. No.

33:18.796 --> 33:20.197
             Let's go.

33:27.672 --> 33:28.739
        Kyle!

33:31.142 --> 33:33.343
        Goddamn it!
                  What the hell?

33:33.345 --> 33:34.845
We're doing this!

33:39.350 --> 33:40.584
          Stop it!

33:49.527 --> 33:51.661
                Stop it!
                Goddamn it!

33:51.663 --> 33:53.363
  Kat!

33:53.365 --> 33:55.699
Kyle! Goddamn it!

33:55.701 --> 33:58.969
          You're finished. Stop!
          Johnny, stay! Stay!

33:58.971 --> 34:01.171
                         Enough!
You don't know
what you're doin'!

34:01.173 --> 34:03.140
               Now, he explained
               some of it to me.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.075
             He loves her.
             That much is clear.

34:05.077 --> 34:06.643
    And that makes it right?

34:06.645 --> 34:08.578
   You're a cop.
   You're supposed to
   represent justice.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.414
     We're all just trying
     to look out for each other.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.815
Are we? Well, I don't see
no evidence of that!

34:12.818 --> 34:15.351
What I see is a community
lookin' out for itself!

34:15.353 --> 34:16.719
       Fuck thy neighbor!

34:16.722 --> 34:18.822
  Fine, you have it your way,
  but whatever happens,

34:18.824 --> 34:20.357
it's on you!

34:20.359 --> 34:21.824
    You just remember that!

34:29.100 --> 34:31.001
       Kyle, go on in the house.

34:31.003 --> 34:32.735
                   I got this.
        (engine revs)

34:46.583 --> 34:48.652
      (door opens, closes)

34:52.556 --> 34:57.427
    (footsteps approaching)

35:04.102 --> 35:06.136
    Where have you been all day?

35:17.815 --> 35:19.549
                    Mark...

35:19.551 --> 35:21.218
             tell me you didn't.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.886
         Do what?

35:23.988 --> 35:26.056
     Kill him and take
     our money back?

35:30.761 --> 35:32.863
I thought about it.

35:34.665 --> 35:36.333
But he ain't worth it.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.436
           Well, where did you--
    I sold my truck.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.804
                  What?

35:40.806 --> 35:44.307
Traded it in
for some piece of shit
out in the driveway.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.209
You can go look
if you don't believe me.

35:49.113 --> 35:51.214
          Why would you do that?

35:53.851 --> 35:57.420
I got us into
this shit-storm, not you.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.990
Tomorrow morning,
we're gonna go get
your ring back.

36:05.463 --> 36:08.632
Oh, he can take my truck.

36:08.634 --> 36:12.369
He can even take my badge,
but he ain't taking your ring.

36:22.713 --> 36:24.414
                  Thank you.

36:39.730 --> 36:44.067
            You can pick up
            your personal items
            from the front desk.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.874
           I ain't got much
           in the way of family,

36:50.876 --> 36:54.544
              so my friends mean
              a lot to me.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.614
           I will cross the line
           to protect them.

37:30.448 --> 37:33.450
        (rocking chair creaking)

37:46.264 --> 37:48.031
            Where have you been?

37:49.233 --> 37:50.667
                    Have a seat.

37:52.770 --> 37:55.205
You're offering me a seat
in my own home?

37:55.207 --> 37:57.540
This house belongs to God

37:57.542 --> 37:59.809
and the people
of this congregation.

37:59.811 --> 38:02.012
                    Not you.

38:12.623 --> 38:14.491
           As chairman of
           the Board of Deacons,

38:14.493 --> 38:17.360
         I convened an emergency
         meeting this morning.

38:19.263 --> 38:20.930
   Well, I guess
   that would explain

38:20.932 --> 38:22.899
    why none of you were
    at the service.

38:22.901 --> 38:25.735
       You think this is
       a joking matter?

38:25.737 --> 38:28.571
      After your behavior?

38:28.573 --> 38:31.541
   That hideous mutilation
   you displayed to the town?

38:37.415 --> 38:39.316
       I'm not proud
       of that incident.

38:40.284 --> 38:43.353
       And I plan to make
       a full apology

38:43.355 --> 38:44.688
           during my sermon
           next Sunday.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.857
              John, can I--
But I will not apologize...

38:47.859 --> 38:50.360
        for the message
        that I am sending out.

38:51.796 --> 38:54.297
       There is a disease
       in this town,

38:54.299 --> 38:56.266
       and it's spreading
       like a wildfire.

38:56.268 --> 38:57.534
           Now, you--
           you can sit there

38:57.536 --> 39:01.137
with your smug, self-righteous
looks on your faces...

39:01.139 --> 39:02.872
or you can open
your fucking eyes

39:02.874 --> 39:05.542
to the devil
in your midst.

39:05.544 --> 39:08.445
           I've already informed
           the District Council

39:08.447 --> 39:10.213
            of your termination.

39:10.215 --> 39:12.582
      They're beginning a search
      for your replacement.
         Don't do this.

39:13.551 --> 39:14.884
                Unfortunately...

39:14.886 --> 39:17.320
             the rectory is
             on church property.

39:17.322 --> 39:19.222
        You're gonna need
        to clear out your things

39:19.224 --> 39:21.057
            as soon as possible.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.994
You're making a big mistake.

39:24.996 --> 39:27.464
A big mistake.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.600
                   (sobs)

39:32.303 --> 39:33.837
            Hi.
                  Hi.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.205
     Come on in.

39:38.976 --> 39:40.143
            How's Amber?

39:40.145 --> 39:41.845
    Oh, she's fine.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.981
Holly's been entertainin'
her all day.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.049
            Good.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.251
Did you get any word
from Allison?

39:48.253 --> 39:50.253
           Nothin'.

39:50.255 --> 39:51.721
She'll come back.

39:51.723 --> 39:52.956
When she's ready.

39:56.427 --> 39:57.894
            No.

40:00.431 --> 40:01.898
       She won't, Megan.

40:04.101 --> 40:06.736
         You never asked me why.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.538
                  Why I hit her.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.706
      Kyle--

40:09.708 --> 40:12.108
        Was I drunk,
        or did I lose my temper.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.344
          Like, you knew
          I always had a temper.

40:16.013 --> 40:18.181
   But this at least,
   it didn't make sense, did it?

40:19.250 --> 40:21.017
It didn't makes sense
to anybody.

40:22.887 --> 40:25.555
         I need you to keep
         that in mind right now.

40:25.557 --> 40:28.691
           I need you to hold on
           to that because...

40:28.693 --> 40:31.494
          none of this is gonna
          make any sense, ever.

40:36.734 --> 40:39.869
                I was trying
                to protect them.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.074
 What the fuck
 are you talking about?
                       That day.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.110
              I came home...

40:49.213 --> 40:51.381
           and I-- I heard them.

40:51.383 --> 40:54.818
              I came upstairs,
              and Allison was...

40:54.820 --> 40:55.985
            attacking Amber.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.220
          She was on top of her.

40:57.222 --> 41:00.657
    What?
              But then I--
              I had to stop her.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.326
       And that was the only way
       I could stop her.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.028
             That's the only way
             she stopped.

41:06.831 --> 41:09.098
             And now, I think...

41:09.100 --> 41:11.334
     I think that she's startin'
     to remember

41:11.336 --> 41:13.269
          or that she has
          remembered everything

41:13.271 --> 41:14.804
      and that's why she's gone.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.842
        Megan, I gotta find her,

41:18.844 --> 41:21.644
   because that's what
   I've been protecting her from

41:21.646 --> 41:23.480
  this entire time, that memory.

41:23.482 --> 41:25.148
    Because I know
    if she remembers everything,

41:25.150 --> 41:27.283
         she's not gonna be able
         to live with herself.

41:27.285 --> 41:29.052
        I gotta find her, Megan.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.254
              Hey.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.072
    I should've called first.

41:50.674 --> 41:52.775
        Is everything okay?

41:56.547 --> 41:58.748
    I'm sorry. I didn't know
    where else to go.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.892
           You've been fightin'.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.396
For a while now...

42:15.366 --> 42:17.567
for the first time...

42:19.336 --> 42:21.771
I feel like I'm losin'.

43:05.416 --> 43:08.184
 (television chatter)
            (loud music playing)

43:22.733 --> 43:24.300
(television and music turns off)

43:27.137 --> 43:28.705
                       Hey.

43:30.307 --> 43:32.041
           I'm Aaron.

43:32.043 --> 43:34.043
            Aaron McCready.

43:35.212 --> 43:36.980
           Okay.

43:36.982 --> 43:39.616
               I'm the one
               who got you out.

43:39.618 --> 43:42.585
          Told Giles I witnessed
          the whole thing.

43:42.587 --> 43:45.388
      Said Anderson carved
      that pentagram on himself.

43:47.324 --> 43:49.959
We both know
that's not what happened.

43:51.562 --> 43:53.262
                  I was there,

43:53.264 --> 43:55.732
             outside the window.

43:55.734 --> 43:57.500
      I saw what you did to him.

43:57.502 --> 43:59.335
                And I gotta say,

43:59.337 --> 44:01.738
              that was some
              serious shit, man.

44:13.117 --> 44:15.551
    Does your momma know
    where you are?

44:16.687 --> 44:17.887
                What?

44:23.494 --> 44:25.194
          Go home.

44:26.363 --> 44:28.598
    While you're still safe.

44:29.767 --> 44:32.669
          I don't wanna go home.

44:32.671 --> 44:34.504
     Not if he's gonna be there.

44:36.774 --> 44:37.974
Why do I get the feeling

44:37.976 --> 44:41.477
we're talking about
a mutual friend?

44:41.479 --> 44:43.212
                      Anderson.

44:47.818 --> 44:50.286
         I want him out
         of my life.

44:54.725 --> 44:56.025
                MEGAN:
                Want more
                mashed potatoes?

44:56.027 --> 44:57.527
             Hold-- hold on.
              A lot or a little?

44:57.529 --> 44:59.395
Here, come sit down...
           All right,
           here it comes. A lot.

44:59.397 --> 45:01.664
             What about chicken?

45:01.666 --> 45:03.132
          KYLE:
          Do you want a biscuit?

45:06.070 --> 45:07.170
     Here, Amber.

45:07.172 --> 45:08.671
                 Come on.

45:08.673 --> 45:10.540
  You got it?
       You want some tea?

45:10.542 --> 45:12.408
Can we say grace?

45:14.511 --> 45:17.380
      That's not something
      we normally do.

45:17.382 --> 45:20.883
Well, Debusey at school
says grace every lunchtime,

45:20.885 --> 45:23.052
     and Debusey is really cool.

45:23.054 --> 45:26.522
  Wait. There's a kid
  at your school called Debusey?

45:26.524 --> 45:29.592
                  When did that
                  become a name?

45:29.594 --> 45:31.894
    If saying grace is
    good enough for Debusey,

45:31.896 --> 45:34.263
      it's good enough
      for the Holter family.

45:35.265 --> 45:36.332
            Mm-hmm.

45:36.334 --> 45:38.334
            And guests.

45:38.336 --> 45:40.737
All right, well, let's link up.

45:42.005 --> 45:43.639
     Gonna do it,
     better do it right.
                         Mm-hmm.

45:55.686 --> 45:58.554
     Dear Lord,
     thank you for the food

45:58.556 --> 46:00.757
    we are about to receive.

46:02.760 --> 46:06.129
      <i> May this food</i>
      <i> restore our strength</i>

46:06.131 --> 46:10.299
      <i> and give new energy</i>
      <i> to tired limbs.</i>

46:13.971 --> 46:17.473
        <i> We pray that</i>
        <i> it will nourish</i>

46:17.475 --> 46:22.478
    <i> and rejuvenate our body</i>
    <i> and our soul.</i>

46:24.448 --> 46:28.985
     <i> If any poor creature</i>
     <i> is hungry or thirsty,</i>

46:28.987 --> 46:31.053
       <i> send him our way</i>

46:31.055 --> 46:34.824
    <i> and we would do our best</i>
    <i> to feed him.</i>

46:34.826 --> 46:39.562
   We will share our food
   with all who are in need,

46:39.564 --> 46:43.332
       just as you share
       your gifts with us.

46:45.769 --> 46:48.271
        Amen.
KYLE: Amen.

46:48.273 --> 46:49.972
Where'd you learn that?

46:49.974 --> 46:51.174
            Debusey.

46:51.176 --> 46:52.809
  Well, that was pretty good.

46:52.811 --> 46:55.678
     MEGAN: What would you like?
      You need a biscuit?
