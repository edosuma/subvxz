00:08.510 --> 00:11.054
<i>NARRATOR".
A peaceful evening at Wayne Manor.</i>

00:11.221 --> 00:15.517
<i>Inside the stately living room,
a musical rehearsal.</i>

00:15.892 --> 00:20.271
Imagine me singing to the piano
of the world-famous Chandell.

00:20.438 --> 00:22.148
I must have lost my wits.

00:22.315 --> 00:24.943
But you have a voice of a nightingale.

00:25.109 --> 00:27.820
And remember what we're rehearsing for...

00:27.987 --> 00:31.449
...the annual benefit
of the great Wayne Foundation.

00:31.616 --> 00:36.704
Oh, my, yes. It's downright selfish of me
to be so nervous, isn't it?

00:36.871 --> 00:38.414
Listen for a moment.

00:38.581 --> 00:44.128
I'll toy idly with the keys
and set the mood again.

00:47.465 --> 00:49.342
Such mastery of the keyboard.

00:49.509 --> 00:51.427
It's almost hypnotic.

00:51.594 --> 00:56.558
I can almost smell the Highland heather,
remembered so fondly from my youth.

00:56.724 --> 01:00.186
And I can see the Gordens
and the Campbells...

01:00.353 --> 01:03.690
...coming down the slopes
of Loch Lomond to meet--

01:06.109 --> 01:09.571
- Bless my eyesight.
- Oh.

01:11.990 --> 01:16.327
Good day to you, lads and lassies.
A very good day to you.

01:21.124 --> 01:24.419
Hand over your jewelry, will you now?

01:24.586 --> 01:29.632
You fiendish figments of
the imagination, what's the meaning of this?

01:29.799 --> 01:32.218
We are ghosts, maestro.

01:32.385 --> 01:35.263
We've been called from slumber
by your bonny music.

01:35.430 --> 01:39.350
Aye, it will happen again and again
wherever you perform.

01:39.517 --> 01:40.602
Go away.

01:40.768 --> 01:44.897
I've never heard such a monstrous threat
in all my life.

01:45.064 --> 01:47.567
Hear this then, maestro.

01:49.402 --> 01:51.362
Oh, it's inhuman.

01:51.529 --> 01:54.240
Indeed, madam. Demonic.

02:02.206 --> 02:05.543
- Oh.
- Swiftly now, lassies, we've much to do.

02:06.002 --> 02:10.131
- The bonny baubles are in the bag.
-Well done, lassies.

02:10.298 --> 02:14.177
Now, let's see what else we can pick up
in handsome Wayne Manor...

02:14.344 --> 02:18.306
...then it's over the hills and far away.

02:20.266 --> 02:24.812
Oh. Oh, maestro, maestro.

02:24.979 --> 02:28.691
Oh, mercy alive. Police.

02:31.903 --> 02:34.572
Amazing, an armed assault
by female phantoms.

02:34.739 --> 02:36.574
Ha. Almost beyond belief.

02:36.741 --> 02:39.369
And in our house too.

02:39.535 --> 02:43.831
What on Earth will Bruce and Dick say
when they get home?

02:43.998 --> 02:46.709
Get home? Uh, Mr. Wayne is away?

02:46.876 --> 02:50.004
Oh, yes, he's off in the wilds
with the Millionaires Hunting Club...

02:50.171 --> 02:53.049
...and my nephew, Dick,
is on a school holiday.

02:53.216 --> 02:57.387
Maybe a blessing. With any luck, we'll
have this wrapped up by the time they return.

02:57.553 --> 03:00.098
Luck spelled "Caped Crusaders."

03:00.264 --> 03:02.308
Oh. What a wonderful idea.

03:02.475 --> 03:05.269
- Why didn't I think of them?
Heh-heh.

03:11.526 --> 03:13.528
Police headquarters.

03:14.529 --> 03:16.322
Switchboard, Commissioner Gordon here.

03:16.489 --> 03:18.950
Plug me in at once
into the hotline Batphone circuit.

03:22.161 --> 03:26.207
I regret to say, sir,
Batman and Robin are not at present available.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.583
What?

03:27.750 --> 03:30.336
Well, surely, you must be jesting.

03:30.670 --> 03:32.505
Alas, sir, I am not.

03:32.672 --> 03:36.175
Batman is enjoying
one of his infrequent vacations.

03:40.888 --> 03:44.517
Catastrophic, unprecedented.

03:44.684 --> 03:48.855
Batman and Robin not available.

03:49.397 --> 03:53.609
You-- You know what this means, don't you?

03:53.776 --> 03:57.238
If you're thinking
what I'm afraid you're thinking...

03:57.405 --> 04:00.658
Precisely, Chief O'Hara.

04:01.826 --> 04:06.164
The moment we've dreaded for years
has arrived.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.499
This time...

04:09.667 --> 04:12.712
...we're going to have to solve a case...

04:13.671 --> 04:14.922
...ourselves.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:35.419 --> 05:39.215
Who knew in advance
that you would be playing a Scotch theme?

05:39.382 --> 05:43.719
Yes, Mr. Chandell, who indeed?
Who beside yourself?

05:43.886 --> 05:48.182
Really, gentlemen, I'm dismayed.

05:51.269 --> 05:56.983
<i>This morning's Gotham City Times,
the society</i> page:

05:57.149 --> 05:58.734
"Among the highlights...

05:58.901 --> 06:02.613
...will be a medley of Highland airs
sung by Mrs. Harriet Cooper...

06:02.780 --> 06:06.450
...to the piano
of the incomparable Chandell."

06:06.617 --> 06:08.661
This travesty's gone far enough.

06:08.828 --> 06:13.249
Now, are you going to call Batman,
or do I have to call him myself...

06:14.041 --> 06:17.879
...on that famous hotline
I've read so much about?

06:18.045 --> 06:19.922
Mr. Chandell.

06:20.715 --> 06:22.133
It's useless.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.094
The grim truth is that Batman and Robin
are on vacation.

06:25.261 --> 06:28.514
The Dynamic Duo, out of town?

06:28.681 --> 06:30.308
How crushing.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.018
Crushing, indeed.

06:32.184 --> 06:37.565
Well, who is going to protect my concert
tonight at Gotham Town Hall?

06:37.732 --> 06:39.567
Tonight?

06:41.611 --> 06:44.947
Now, hear this, emergency, cancel all leaves.

06:45.114 --> 06:49.035
Throw a complete anti-criminal cordon
around Gotham Town Hall.

06:49.368 --> 06:53.539
Don't count us out, Mr. Chandell.
The situation is well in hand.

06:53.706 --> 06:55.249
Good day, sir.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.668
A good day, sir.

06:58.169 --> 07:03.090
But will it be a good night?

07:08.387 --> 07:10.932
I'm frightened, Chief O'Hara.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.434
An echo haunts my ears.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.770
I'd give me right arm to hear it now.

07:15.937 --> 07:22.068
The noblest, most inspiring words
in the entire English language:

07:22.234 --> 07:25.696
"To the Batmobile, Robin. Let's go."

07:27.281 --> 07:30.493
<i>NARRATOR".
Behind the facade of a bankrupt manufacturer...</i>

07:30.660 --> 07:34.246
<i>...of music rolls for mechanical player pianos...</i>

07:34.413 --> 07:38.459
<i>...the headquarters
of an infamous criminal genius, Chandell.</i>

07:40.086 --> 07:44.382
Seems almost too easy
with Batman and Robin on vacation.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.802
Chandell, love, could it be a trap?

07:47.969 --> 07:50.221
Oh, impossible, my sweets.

07:50.388 --> 07:53.975
You should have seen
the dear commissioner's face.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.644
The Dynamic Duo is away, all right.

07:56.811 --> 07:58.646
What a break.

07:58.813 --> 08:02.274
The one every super crook has dreamed of.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.819
They're utterly fooled.

08:04.986 --> 08:10.783
Our clever charade at Wayne Manor
has put me above suspicion.

08:10.950 --> 08:12.410
Gee.

08:14.954 --> 08:19.291
Oh, that must be your twin brother, Harry,
at the secret entrance.

08:19.458 --> 08:24.130
Get into your costumes, dearies.
I'll let him in.

08:38.269 --> 08:40.229
Everything set for tonight's caper?

08:40.395 --> 08:41.688
Of course.

08:41.856 --> 08:45.317
Tiny radio transmitter hooked up
inside your criminal piano?

08:45.484 --> 08:49.071
- Naturally.
-It should be a pretty good haul.

08:49.238 --> 08:52.324
I'll take 95 percent this time.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.951
You fiend.

08:54.285 --> 08:58.956
Blackmailing a genius like myself
into a life of crime.

08:59.123 --> 09:01.333
It's your own fault, Chandell, kid...

09:01.500 --> 09:05.421
...using a mechanical player piano
at the White House concert...

09:05.588 --> 09:07.089
...which made you famous.

09:07.256 --> 09:11.135
What else could I do?
I'd hurt my fingers in the piano lid.

09:11.302 --> 09:12.720
Who cares?

09:12.887 --> 09:18.267
If I expose what you did, the great Chandell
is deader than this music roll factory.

09:18.434 --> 09:23.355
Using a player piano,
fooling the president of the U.S.A...

09:23.522 --> 09:27.318
...with a roll out by Paderewski.

09:30.738 --> 09:35.826
Harry, what would it take
for me to get out of your power?

09:36.368 --> 09:39.371
Five million bucks, cash.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.373
I can get it for you, Harry.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.626
Five million? Where?

09:44.126 --> 09:46.796
I have a fantastic plan.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.923
In fact, I've already started.

09:49.090 --> 09:54.178
If it works, I'll have the entire fortune
of the Wayne family.

09:54.345 --> 09:57.807
Chandell, have you flipped your keyboard?

09:58.265 --> 10:02.269
Ask me no more, dear brother, you'll see.

10:11.654 --> 10:16.826
What, we have to be fingerprinted
before we enter the auditorium?

10:16.992 --> 10:19.495
- How very gauche, if I may say so.
-Oh!

10:19.662 --> 10:20.746
All right, Hoffman.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.332
Officer.

10:23.499 --> 10:24.875
Let these people through.

10:25.042 --> 10:28.379
As I scarcely need tell you, Mrs. Cooper,
we have grave fears tonight.

10:28.546 --> 10:30.923
I'm taking no chance
of a criminal slipping through.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.467
Of course, I understand.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.512
But how embarrassing for poor Chandell.

10:36.679 --> 10:40.307
Can't be helped. I'm leaving no stone
unturned in our effort to protect him.

10:40.474 --> 10:43.561
- Have a pleasant evening.
-Thank you.

10:51.694 --> 10:54.321
Still, it nags at me.

10:54.488 --> 10:58.534
There's a certain indefinable
clumsiness in our procedure.

10:58.701 --> 11:02.371
D-minus-5 seconds, curtain going up.

11:02.538 --> 11:06.667
Commissioner Gordon to all machine gunners
stationed in theater boxes, get ready.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.963
At the first sign of criminal activity,
make every bullet count.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.296
Strange.

12:34.463 --> 12:37.007
Strange? Strange what?

12:37.174 --> 12:41.804
I've been listening to that Chandell concert
from Gotham Town Hall.

12:41.971 --> 12:47.434
Just before the end of "Danse Arabe"
he struck a C-minor chord...

12:47.601 --> 12:50.479
...that I'm positive doesn't belong there.

12:50.646 --> 12:52.815
I'm not sure I follow you.

12:52.982 --> 12:57.569
Oh, I don't know, just a simple error.

12:57.987 --> 13:02.449
But do me a favor, chum,
run out and check the muskrat traps?

13:02.616 --> 13:04.868
Sure thing, Bruce.

13:13.544 --> 13:15.421
Gee, Sal.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.756
Gosh, Dick.

13:18.090 --> 13:21.635
- That about says everything, doesn't it?
-Uh-huh.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.770
Oh, me and my left-footed thumbs,
how did I do that?

13:31.937 --> 13:33.689
It's all right, Dick, I'll mop it up.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.232
- Are you sure?
-Uh-huh.

13:35.399 --> 13:37.609
Oh, don't be upset.

13:46.035 --> 13:49.872
- Dick Grayson to Bruce Wayne, what's up?
-Not sure. What would you say if I said...

13:50.039 --> 13:53.083
...the great Chandell had just made a mistake
in a C-minor chord?

13:53.250 --> 13:54.668
Holy impossibility.

13:54.835 --> 13:59.757
Precisely, Dick.
Something strange and unusual is going on.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.217
I'm afraid it means the end of our vacations.

14:02.384 --> 14:05.095
Oh, of all the awful luck.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.890
- Mm, beg pardon?
-Never mind, Bruce.

14:08.057 --> 14:11.268
The fight against crime
comes before everything.

14:11.435 --> 14:14.146
- Where do you want me to meet you?
-Wayne Manor.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.774
I fear we haven't a moment to lose.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.154
Good heavens.

14:22.321 --> 14:26.116
The Burma Import Company,
it's just been blasted and robbed.

14:26.283 --> 14:29.370
Saints alive.
While he was playing a Burmese number.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.247
The same dreadful pattern.

14:32.414 --> 14:38.796
The felons were a trio of female phantoms,
apparently Burmese dancing girls.

14:39.171 --> 14:41.965
Chief O'Hara to all machine gunners...

14:42.132 --> 14:47.429
...you can put back on your safety catches,
we've been outfoxed.

14:47.596 --> 14:49.390
Batman.

14:49.556 --> 14:53.936
Batman, where the devil are you
in this hour of need?

15:02.486 --> 15:03.570
<i>Yes?</i>

15:03.737 --> 15:05.906
Chandell here, my sweets. How did it go?

15:06.073 --> 15:08.826
Like a dream, lover.

15:08.992 --> 15:13.747
Too bad we have to turn over 95 percent
to that chiseling, bad nick brother of yours.

15:13.914 --> 15:18.335
Don't worry,
we'll buy him off forever, quite soon.

15:18.502 --> 15:21.171
Instructions, stake out Wayne Manor...

15:21.338 --> 15:24.716
...and let me know the moment
Bruce Wayne and his young ward return.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.220
A grim tale, indeed.

15:28.387 --> 15:31.390
I reproach myself bitterly
for having been out of touch.

15:31.557 --> 15:33.100
Oh, I wouldn't do that, sir.

15:33.267 --> 15:36.728
Doubtless your brief excursion
into the wilderness has sharpened your mind.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.981
True, Alfred, and yet...

15:39.148 --> 15:40.357
Where's Mrs. Cooper now?

15:40.691 --> 15:44.486
At her request, sir,
I left her at Gotham Town Hall.

15:44.653 --> 15:49.450
She insisted on paying a private visit
to the great maestro in his dressing room.

15:49.616 --> 15:53.162
Gosh, he's quite a famous ladies' man,
isn't he?

15:53.328 --> 15:59.293
Really, Dick, I'm afraid some romantic interlude
has fevered your imagination.

15:59.460 --> 16:03.422
Your Aunt Harriet is utterly above reproach.

16:03.589 --> 16:06.425
Gee, whiz, I certainly didn't mean that she...

16:09.428 --> 16:11.013
Holy apparition.

16:20.272 --> 16:22.649
Gone, like wraiths.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.693
Who the heck were they?

16:24.860 --> 16:27.613
Criminal tools, of course.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.325
There's a mystery here...

16:31.492 --> 16:37.498
...and I have a strange hunch
that Chandell is at the heart of it.

16:40.876 --> 16:45.005
- Will the commissioner be in his office?
-Of course. In the face of this crime wave...

16:45.172 --> 16:48.842
<i>...he'll be alertly marshaling
all the forces of law and order.</i>

16:54.223 --> 16:57.309
- Yes?
-Put any fears you may have had aside...

16:57.476 --> 16:59.603
...commissioner, we're back in action.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.438
Batman. Batman.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.607
The answer to a policeman's prayer.

17:03.774 --> 17:05.567
Thank you, commissioner.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.319
Good night.

17:07.903 --> 17:11.156
First on the agenda, check on Aunt Harriet.

17:11.323 --> 17:14.451
To the Batpoles. Let's go.

17:18.579 --> 17:22.459
Bonnie, call Chandell in his dressing room
at Gotham Town Hall.

17:22.626 --> 17:25.420
Tell him the Dynamic Duo is back in action.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.047
Yes, sir.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.313
Back in action?

17:43.480 --> 17:45.649
Uh, how reassuring.

17:45.816 --> 17:48.443
Thank you for the information.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.072
What is it, maestro?

17:52.239 --> 17:55.367
Oh, nothing, just a call from my agent.

17:55.534 --> 18:00.289
- Are you enjoying your root beer?
-Oh, yes, it's delicious.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.249
May I?

18:17.014 --> 18:21.560
Yes, sweet lady,
it has been most delicious...

18:21.727 --> 18:26.481
...but I fear this thrilling téte-à-téte
must come to an end for now.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.692
Oh, how thoughtless of me.

18:28.859 --> 18:32.988
Artists like yourself need sleep, don't they?

18:33.155 --> 18:35.574
You put it so well.

18:35.741 --> 18:38.869
Dear Harriet, until tomorrow?

18:39.036 --> 18:43.707
Oh, what dreams I'll have.

18:46.084 --> 18:50.005
I trust you'll have no trouble getting home,
my pet?

18:53.550 --> 18:56.762
I sent Alfred on ahead...

18:56.928 --> 19:01.016
...but there's almost always
a cab waiting downstairs.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.393
Until tomorrow.

19:03.560 --> 19:08.231
- Parting is such sweet sorrow.
-Oh.

19:19.743 --> 19:22.496
Until tomorrow.

19:38.387 --> 19:42.724
Good news, Chandell, kiddo,
your pal, Mr. Wayne, is back.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.977
Bad news, so are the Caped Crusaders.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.562
They must be eliminated.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.732
<i>- How?
- Are your nasty piano movers handy?</i>

19:50.899 --> 19:53.568
Yeah. They're snoozing in the back room.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.237
Awaken them at once.

19:55.404 --> 19:57.114
Do exactly as I say.

19:58.573 --> 20:01.118
There's Aunt Harriet now,
getting into that cab.

20:01.284 --> 20:04.371
- Holy relief, she must be on her way home.
-No doubt, Robin.

20:04.538 --> 20:07.416
Let's have a word with Chandell, shall we?

20:32.774 --> 20:35.026
The poor devil.

20:35.193 --> 20:37.946
He's been assaulted with a root beer bottle.

20:38.113 --> 20:42.284
What luck. Here's a bottle of smelling salts.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.876
Heavenly days, am I dreaming?

20:51.042 --> 20:54.129
No, it's us, in the flesh. Who attacked you?

20:54.296 --> 21:00.552
I've covered for the fiend long enough.
It was my criminal twin brother, Harry.

21:00.719 --> 21:02.262
Holy fratricide.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.097
Any idea where he hangs out?

21:04.264 --> 21:06.308
As a matter of fact, yes.

21:06.475 --> 21:09.936
His lair is an abandoned music roll factory.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.355
Twenty Befront Street.

21:12.522 --> 21:19.488
Zip code, 9999979.

21:19.654 --> 21:22.240
Thank you, Chandell. We'll take care of him.

21:22.407 --> 21:24.159
Come on, Robin.

21:37.047 --> 21:39.466
Look, Batman, the felonious phantoms.

21:39.633 --> 21:43.094
Indeed, Robin. From the looks in their eyes,
I think they're the victims...

21:43.261 --> 21:45.555
...of some kind of criminal hypnotism.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.057
Let's interrogate them, huh?

21:47.224 --> 21:50.018
Good thought, Robin.
Perhaps we can learn something.

23:06.469 --> 23:09.472
Take them to the cutting machine.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.951
Holy pianola, what is this?

23:30.493 --> 23:36.458
It's obvious, we're about to be fed
into a machine...

23:36.625 --> 23:40.712
...designed to perforate paper
into player piano rolls.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.925
Farewell, costumed clowns.

23:45.091 --> 23:50.722
And now, exit music for a pair of bats.

23:53.016 --> 23:56.895
You'll come out presently
as perforated music rolls.

23:57.395 --> 24:03.193
The great Chandell could play
no more prettily than you will.

24:06.196 --> 24:08.365
Good bye.
