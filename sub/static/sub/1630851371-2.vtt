So how much fun did you have
as mother nature?

01:13.115 --> 01:15.991
Oh, my gosh.
This has been exhilarating.

01:16.035 --> 01:18.368
I challenged myself.

You know, I've done
so many things in my career,

And we have new student
transfers here tonight

03:43.140 --> 03:46.391
as two wild cards
enter the competition.

03:46.435 --> 03:50.187
And let's face it,
we're all a little suspicious
of the new kids, right?

03:50.231 --> 03:53.232
Now, let's give it up
for the cool kids,

03:53.275 --> 03:55.859

04:04.954 --> 04:08.330
You know what?
I also have some other big news.

04:08.374 --> 04:12.876
This season, we're introducing
something monumental, panel.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.504
We're making tv history.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.632
It's called...

04:18.676 --> 04:20.884
The take it off buzzer.

04:20.886 --> 04:23.470
- What?
- Wow.

04:23.514 --> 04:26.139
Oh, my gosh.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.475
Oh, my god!
It looks dangerous.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.644
It's hot. Steaming hot.

04:30.688 --> 04:32.271
- Oh, yeah.
- Ken: Whoa.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.472
- It's about to get good.
- That looks dangerous, guys.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.400
Front and center.

04:36.402 --> 04:39.194
- That is so cool.
- Nick: Ahh!

04:39.238 --> 04:42.364
- Don't touch it! Stop it!
- I won't touch it.

04:42.408 --> 04:44.032
- Just looking at it.
- ( vocalizing )

04:44.034 --> 04:45.993
this is how it works.

04:45.995 --> 04:49.079
Panel, if you're 100% certain

04:49.123 --> 04:51.206
you know the identity
of a singer,

04:51.250 --> 04:53.959
you can hit
the take it off buzzer.

04:54.003 --> 04:55.168
And if you're right,

04:55.212 --> 04:58.171
the singer must unmask
on the spot

04:58.215 --> 05:00.632
and will be sent home
immediately.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.883
What?

05:01.927 --> 05:04.136
And because of that,
you will be rewarded

05:04.138 --> 05:05.887
with two extra points...

05:05.931 --> 05:07.014
Yes!

05:07.057 --> 05:08.307
...Towards
the golden ear trophy.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.851
- Really?
- That's awesome.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.269
But if you're wrong,

05:12.271 --> 05:15.022
you will be
significantly punished!

05:15.065 --> 05:17.399
Not significantly punished!

05:17.443 --> 05:20.485
- Significantly punished!
- Oh, my gosh.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.321
But only one of you can use it
per group, all right?

05:22.364 --> 05:25.991
And whatever you do,
please, please, please

05:26.035 --> 05:28.035
be extremely cautious--

05:28.078 --> 05:30.078
- oh, ken!
- What?

05:30.122 --> 05:32.331
- What are you doing?
- Ken! Ken!

05:32.374 --> 05:33.915
You're not supposed
to do that right now!

05:33.959 --> 05:37.252
- Robin: Significant!
- What are you thinking?

05:37.296 --> 05:40.038
- I'm gonna take it off.
- He's fired.

05:40.049 --> 05:42.591
I'm sorry! I got excited!

05:42.634 --> 05:44.259
You're like
one of those kids
who just can't--

05:44.303 --> 05:46.219
I can't help it!
Have you met me?

05:46.263 --> 05:47.387
Of course I'm gonna do that!

05:47.431 --> 05:50.140
Should we significantly
punish ken?

05:50.142 --> 05:53.352
- Yes!
- Yes, punish ken!

05:53.395 --> 05:55.354
No! Daddy,
I want a second chance.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.357
I think that jacket
is punishment enough.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.151
Thank you.
Thank you, daddy.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.403
Sit your ass down, ken.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.115
Okay, and for
the first time ever,

06:07.159 --> 06:11.286
let's kick things off
with a wild card!

06:11.330 --> 06:14.623
We have a new character entering
the hallways of group a.

looks like though.

Now this is a costume.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.401
Oh, my gosh.

06:42.403 --> 06:45.362
What are you doing,
hamster?

06:48.158 --> 06:50.992
I wanted to become the hamster
because unfortunately

06:50.994 --> 06:53.995
my body is shaped
very much like a hamster.

06:53.997 --> 06:59.751
And also I felt stuck
in a bit of a wheel
going round and round.

06:59.795 --> 07:04.131
I mean, who hasn't felt all
cooped up the last year or so?

07:04.174 --> 07:06.341
- Headphones.
- Could be, like, a dj.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.927
But it has been difficult
because I'm kinda, like, a guy

07:08.971 --> 07:13.306
who's always jumping
from one project to the next
with my famous friends.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.185

07:17.229 --> 07:19.855

has been tricky

07:22.109 --> 07:24.025
trying to keep momentum going.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.945
But now I'm breaking routine

07:26.989 --> 07:30.866

all that pent up energy
as the wild card!

11:08.418 --> 11:09.793
Look at that locker budget.

11:09.836 --> 11:10.669
Here we go.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.129
Hamster, I'm about
to go up in here.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.173
Let's see what you got.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.549
- Okay.
- What's that?

11:16.593 --> 11:19.386
We got a baseball bat.

11:19.429 --> 11:23.139
Ooh, it stinks, too.
It really smells like
a hamster cage.

11:23.141 --> 11:26.434
Hamster, what can you tell us
about your stank-ass locker?

11:28.021 --> 11:32.265
It's sunny
and I like to play baseball.

11:32.275 --> 11:35.151
I mean, that leads me to,
like, danny devito.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.820
I'm way ( bell rings ) taller.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.446
Whoa!

11:41.159 --> 11:43.952
This hamster is un-caged.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.287
Hamster, what are you--
you can't get in the locker.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.249
- Ken: Wow.
- Is this helping you out any?

11:49.251 --> 11:51.042
I tell you
with that kind of energy,

11:51.086 --> 11:54.003
- that hamster
reminds me of me.
- Yes!

11:54.005 --> 11:55.839
I would say this was you
if I didn't know any better.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.049
Ken: He's a comedic actor.
He's gotta be.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.427
You know who the voice
reminds me of though?

12:00.470 --> 12:01.553
- Who?
- Bill murray.

12:01.847 --> 12:05.181
Just him singing like
the lounge singer on "snl."

12:05.225 --> 12:07.809
- yeah.
- He's got that kind of tone.

12:07.853 --> 12:10.145
But it could also
be brendan fraser.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.105
I did a movie with him.
"furry vengeance."

12:12.149 --> 12:13.273
look it up.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.275
Well, you know when
I saw the goldfish,

12:15.318 --> 12:18.319
I thought maybe, like, someone

12:18.363 --> 12:20.238
that was in "finding nemo,"
like an albert brooks.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.157
- Robin: Yeah.
- Okay.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.160
But I was also thinking,
like, a tim allen

12:25.162 --> 12:26.786
- who I know can sing.
- That's true.

12:26.830 --> 12:27.829
Kelsey grammer
and andy richter.

12:27.873 --> 12:28.913
Andy richter, I like that.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.625
- He's gotta be a comedian.
- He's a show-stealer.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.085
He's a show-stealer.

12:34.129 --> 12:37.589
Only people like dr. Ken
would go for this many jokes

12:37.632 --> 12:39.132
in one segment.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.884
You know who's
a real showman,
a real entertainer?

12:40.927 --> 12:44.095
- Jack black.
- Whoo.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.306
Nicole: Okay.
Thank you, audience.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.684
- That's an audience
that showed up today.
- I love that.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.270
- I love jack black.
- There it is. Great guess,

12:52.314 --> 12:56.858
great job, panel,
and great job to the hamster

12:56.902 --> 12:58.943
and all of this insane energy.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.236
Now...

13:02.032 --> 13:03.406
He's going to be around.
That's a crowd favorite.

13:04.367 --> 13:08.161
- ( thunk )
- hamster, hamster!

13:08.205 --> 13:12.040
Oh, my god.
I love him so much.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.042
It's over!

13:14.085 --> 13:15.543
Please let me
get to round two.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.462
I'll make nick
even more uncomfortable.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.051
<i> - ♪ who is that? </i>
- ( bell rings )

13:26.932 --> 13:30.600
welcome to
back to school night here
on "the masked singer."

13:30.644 --> 13:33.019
our next singer got straight as

13:33.063 --> 13:34.854
for her performance last night,

13:34.898 --> 13:37.106
but what was her rep
back in school?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.483
I'll let her explain.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.861
( bell rings )

13:41.905 --> 13:44.364
I feel like
I'm forever a student.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.407
But, you know...

13:46.451 --> 13:49.244
The biggest I've learned
is that life happens.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.121
School was always easy for me.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.957
I had a full ride scholarship

13:54.000 --> 13:57.043
when I got some unexpected news

13:57.087 --> 13:58.670
that changed everything.

13:58.713 --> 14:02.257
- Wow.
- Did she have a baby
or something?

14:02.300 --> 14:04.217
I was forced to take
a different course,

14:04.261 --> 14:08.221
but I learned life lessons
I'd never get in the classroom.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.932
Success isn't measured
in a diploma.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.851
- She's a golfer?
- A pro athlete?

14:12.894 --> 14:16.020
And it turns out,
that pivot in my life

14:16.064 --> 14:18.690
was the greatest degree
I could ever get.

14:18.692 --> 14:22.443
So I've decided to sing a song
for all the women out there

14:22.487 --> 14:24.904
who put their own dreams
on hold for others,

14:24.948 --> 14:28.157

- Absolutely amazing.

16:35.620 --> 16:39.789
We are not worthy!

16:39.833 --> 16:42.166
I've got to bow down.

16:42.210 --> 16:46.838
One of the best
vocal performances I've ever
witnessed in my life.

16:46.881 --> 16:50.258
Six seasons, I have never
got up on this desk like that.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.552
That was the funk, the stank,

16:52.595 --> 16:54.137
the skunk, the whoo!

16:54.139 --> 16:56.139
The funk, the stank,
and the skunk!

16:56.182 --> 16:58.433
When you take pain and passion

16:58.435 --> 17:02.270
and turn it into the joy
and the voice of god?

17:02.272 --> 17:05.106
- Thank you so much, skunk.
- Wow, robin!

17:05.984 --> 17:09.569
Well said.
What kind of student

17:09.612 --> 17:11.154
was skunk back in the day?

17:11.156 --> 17:14.323
Men in black,
bring out the locker.

17:16.995 --> 17:19.078
Aw, man, I'm still
coming down from it.

17:19.122 --> 17:22.165
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.333
So, let's see
what's in her locker.

17:25.462 --> 17:29.630
- Oh, oh.
- Oh, razzle dazzle.

17:29.632 --> 17:32.133
Squad tryouts, french final.

17:32.177 --> 17:34.302
We see-
it's a projector in here.

17:34.345 --> 17:38.181
Because of ms. Education,
I'm always ready for the action.

17:38.224 --> 17:43.227
You know what?
Ms. Education makes me think
of lauryn hill right now.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.481
Nick: The audience
is agreeing with you.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.941
This is someone
who has an acting career.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.151
She was in
"sister act part ii."

17:50.195 --> 17:53.196
almost as good as
"hangover part ii"

17:53.239 --> 17:55.865
and better than
"the godfather part ii."

17:55.909 --> 17:57.366
and that is a fact.
Look it up.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.119
She had a crash course
in motherhood

18:00.163 --> 18:02.121
which has influenced her art.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.082
It all makes sense.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.418
This is the special
ken fan club episode.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.295
- Nick: Yeah, exactly.
- They got all free seats.

18:09.297 --> 18:12.131
They're my children, robin!

18:12.133 --> 18:14.842
Okay, now there's a few--
we'll run through a few names

18:14.877 --> 18:16.844
who can sing
at that high of a level.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.931
- There is yolanda adams.
- Nicole: Yeah.
I just wrote that down.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.182
She's a little taller though.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.309
- There's jill scott.
- Yes.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.145
And also fantasia,
who I toured with.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.939
- Fantasia.
- Oh, fantasia.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.148
Ken: That's a good guess.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.150
Oh, this is frustrating.

18:31.152 --> 18:35.113
Well, first of all, we have
the book of acting, right?

18:35.156 --> 18:37.156
So I was like, who are some
great actors that can sing?

18:37.158 --> 18:40.618
Janelle monáe. She can sing.
Super talented.

18:40.620 --> 18:44.038
- Janelle monáe always
wears black and white.
- Nick: That is true.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.748
I would say that's some
powerhouse guesses.

18:45.792 --> 18:50.086
Make some noise,
because we got a legend
in the building.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.421
- Skunk, incredible job.
- Thank you.

18:52.423 --> 18:55.842
- Now head on backstage.
- Outstanding!

18:55.885 --> 18:59.387
Singing "a man's world"
really reminds me
of my past struggles.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.347
Sacrifice is always
worth it though,

19:01.391 --> 19:03.516
and I hope they feel that
in my performance.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.208
Let's check it out.

19:32.297 --> 19:34.338
When I was in school,
I was sheltered.

19:34.382 --> 19:37.425
My household was very religious.

19:37.427 --> 19:40.303
While the other kids
were off going to movies
and listening to music,

19:40.346 --> 19:42.805
all of that
was off limits to me,

19:42.849 --> 19:44.015
and I to keep my dreams
to myself.

19:44.058 --> 19:47.185
A diary?
"diary of alicia keys."

19:47.187 --> 19:49.854
when I first rose to fame,
I definitely turned heads.

19:49.898 --> 19:53.149
Cardinals? Could that be
st. Louis cardinals?

19:53.151 --> 19:56.319
Some of these I wore got people
talking back at church.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.405
But I didn't care.
It felt good to express myself.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.991
I'm leaning in
to that sexy side here.

because I couldn't hear
her vocals that much,

22:26.888 --> 22:28.429
and I don't know who it is,
and it's driving me crazy.

22:28.473 --> 22:29.388
She's a singer or a rapper.
I'm very confused.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.349
Nick: Well, maybe
we can help y'all out.

- Ooh.

Bring it out.

22:40.151 --> 22:43.152

- I am so stumped.

22:43.196 --> 22:46.197

22:47.450 --> 22:48.449
Ooh.

22:49.410 --> 22:52.161
- Spelling bee champion.
- Yeah.

22:52.163 --> 22:53.412
- Smarty pants.
- Yeah.

22:53.414 --> 22:58.250
Well, there is a clue.
I mean, I have bars.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.587
- I got moves.
- Okay.

23:01.631 --> 23:03.255
But also have letters.

23:03.299 --> 23:06.133
Is this just, like, m.I.A.?

23:06.135 --> 23:09.220
Are these, like, letters
that are spelled out as letters?

23:09.263 --> 23:10.846
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.556
So you're guessing already, ken?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.266
I'm always guessing.

23:15.395 --> 23:18.020
You know, I saw that bird,
and I thought,

23:18.022 --> 23:20.231
okay, maybe this
is nelly furtado.

23:20.274 --> 23:21.315
Yes.

23:21.359 --> 23:23.025
Nick: Yeah, yeah.
"I'm like a bird."

23:23.069 --> 23:24.193
it could be nelly furtado, yeah.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.028
I think that's a solid guess.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.155
But what about somebody
like vanessa hudgens?

23:28.157 --> 23:30.825
- Could be.
- It's vanessa's cute body.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.702
You know, I mean,
I'm just also thinking about
the sci-fi of it all,

23:33.746 --> 23:36.539
like the ufos, because
this could be an actress,

23:36.582 --> 23:38.165
someone like zoe saldana

23:38.209 --> 23:40.126
who's been in "star trek,"
"guardians of the galaxy,"

23:40.169 --> 23:42.294
- "avatar"--
- "drumline"!

23:42.338 --> 23:43.254
Really?

23:43.297 --> 23:45.673
Don't forget
where it all started.

23:45.716 --> 23:48.884
- Zoe was in "drumline"?
- How do you not know that?

23:48.928 --> 23:52.346
You know,
I only watched it for you.

23:52.390 --> 23:53.806
Jenny: Can I ask you
a question, robin?

23:53.850 --> 23:55.141
Could she be
disguising her voice?

23:55.143 --> 23:56.392
Yes, she's definitely
disguising--

23:56.436 --> 23:58.686
she is.
That's why we're so perturbed.

23:58.729 --> 24:02.857

24:14.162 --> 24:16.036
I miss performing so much.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.872
I haven't been able to perform

I felt the most free

24:52.158 --> 24:54.950
to be myself-- my garage.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.619
In that dusty space,

I created my own world.

25:00.166 --> 25:03.250
I put on shows.
I gave the best performances.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.127
That's the disney concert hall.

25:05.129 --> 25:08.589
And my shows
were always sold out.

in the bull's locker.

- Oh, my gosh!

All right, stop.
How dare you?

28:25.454 --> 28:27.913
Ah!

28:27.957 --> 28:31.208
I've always been a fan
of school spirit,

28:31.252 --> 28:36.880
but nothing makes me happier
than the cheer of the crowd!

28:36.882 --> 28:39.007
That's what
makes me happy, nick.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.592
That sound right there.

28:40.594 --> 28:41.593
All right.

28:41.637 --> 28:42.928
Off of that, you know,

28:42.972 --> 28:45.222
it makes me think,
just with the locker,

28:45.266 --> 28:47.182
with the cheerleaders,
like, the high school motif,

28:47.184 --> 28:49.184
it made me think
of darren criss,

28:49.228 --> 28:52.062
because he's got the same
kind of body size.

28:52.106 --> 28:54.022
- He's so multitalented.
- Yeah.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.233
Or it could be
a recording artist

28:56.277 --> 28:58.277
- singing another genre.
- Yeah.

28:58.279 --> 29:01.029
And maybe because
this was a country song,

29:01.073 --> 29:02.322
like, I loved
justin timberlake's version

29:02.366 --> 29:04.533
of "tennessee whiskey"
with chris stapleton.

29:04.577 --> 29:06.910
- Oh, loved it.
- You think that's
justin timberlake?

29:06.954 --> 29:09.788
I'm saying--
I'm just thinking off of this--

29:09.832 --> 29:11.290
that wouldn't be a bad guess.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.293
Thank you, daddy.
I appreciate that.

29:14.295 --> 29:16.420
Robin: But honestly,
the voice is so strong,

29:16.464 --> 29:18.297
and he's so strong
as a performer,

29:18.340 --> 29:21.049
I have a pretty good feeling
I've never heard
your voice before.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.635
- Really?
- Because you would know it.

29:23.679 --> 29:27.055
- I feel like it's so good.
- That's the purpose
of this show, robin.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.057
Yes, exactly.
A talent not all of us
know about.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.851
- Yeah.
- But I hear a little bit

29:30.895 --> 29:33.937
of a rock singer in there
who can riff,

29:33.981 --> 29:35.355
so I think of the killers,
brandon flowers.

29:35.399 --> 29:39.902
Rufus wainwright
comes to mind.

29:39.945 --> 29:42.821
I like that guess,
but based off the clue,

29:42.865 --> 29:44.364
when I saw
the disney concert hall,

29:44.408 --> 29:46.408
I kinda went towards
that disney feel.

29:46.452 --> 29:49.077
Could it be maybe one of
the jonas brothers?

29:49.121 --> 29:51.371
- Maybe kevin jonas?
- Ken: It's a good guess.

29:51.415 --> 29:54.416

Not getting a jobro.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.418
But then I saw
those cheerleaders pop out.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.129
I don't know.
I want it to be
zac efron so badly.

"high school musical"
and everything with
the cheerleaders.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.720
- That's not bad.
- All right, thanks, nick.

30:06.764 --> 30:11.016
I just want to mention,
that performance was so raw
and emotional,

30:11.060 --> 30:15.020

Like, I'm not gonna lie,

34:24.688 --> 34:28.023

you have a really great voice.

34:28.025 --> 34:32.277
- Thank you. Thank you.

- Okay, so it's time
for our panel's

34:41.997 --> 34:44.790

- First impression of a baby?

34:44.833 --> 34:50.796
Write them down
and then put them in
the baby basket right there.

34:50.839 --> 34:55.092

- I have no idea.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.599
Everybody put theirs

35:02.643 --> 35:05.060
Nicole: I have no idea.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.313
All right, time's up, panel.

35:08.357 --> 35:11.983
- ( baby burps )
- well, you know what?

35:12.027 --> 35:13.110
I'm gonna give you guys
so more help.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.277
Yeah, help us.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.404
The locker,
bring it out, bring it out.

35:16.406 --> 35:19.241
- ( bell rings )
- oh, baby was in high school.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.492
- So, precocious.
- It's an advanced baby.

35:20.536 --> 35:22.994
Got it.
It was a benjamin
button's baby, okay.

35:24.456 --> 35:27.999
- He's so cute.
- So we're going to
the baby's locker.

35:28.043 --> 35:29.584
- You guys ready?
- Yeah!

35:29.628 --> 35:32.212
- Baby!
- The baby.

35:32.256 --> 35:33.797
Ken:
Baby got a report card.

35:33.841 --> 35:36.591
All right.
Failed driver's ed.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.010
"too many high speed chases."

35:39.054 --> 35:40.929
I'm telling you,
action movie star.

35:40.973 --> 35:44.015
Sometimes when
I don't get a nap,

35:44.059 --> 35:47.144
I get the need to feed.

35:47.187 --> 35:50.230
He has the need to feed,
a play on a need--

35:50.274 --> 35:52.440
- for speed.
- Oh!

35:52.484 --> 35:55.193
If you look at the clues,
this is a big action star.

35:55.237 --> 35:57.654
You saw white house,
you saw "independence day,"

35:57.698 --> 36:00.532
so I'm thinking will smith,
big action star.

36:00.576 --> 36:03.702
Hugh jackman because
of the australian accent.

36:03.737 --> 36:06.872
But would hugh jackman
replace arnold schwarzenegger
in anything?

36:06.874 --> 36:09.082
- I don't see a close--
- oh, yeah.

36:09.126 --> 36:11.126
I think in hollywood,
people get replaced all--

36:11.128 --> 36:13.003
I almost got the part
in "drumline."

36:13.046 --> 36:15.088
I was, like, on the shortlist.

36:15.132 --> 36:17.090
- Literally the shortlist.
- Literally the short list.

36:17.134 --> 36:19.551
They said,
"if you needed someone shorter
and less talented,

36:19.595 --> 36:21.136
ken's your boy."

36:21.138 --> 36:22.888
you know,
I was thinking, too, like,

36:22.931 --> 36:24.222
the vin diesels of the world.

36:24.266 --> 36:26.349
- Vin diesel is a great guess.
- Oh, yeah.

36:26.393 --> 36:29.019
And vin diesel
was in "the pacifier."

36:29.062 --> 36:30.187
- there you go.
- That's true.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.521
Ooh.

36:31.565 --> 36:33.356
All: Oh!

36:33.400 --> 36:35.317

36:35.360 --> 36:38.153
Robin: The only person that
I think could do all of that,

36:38.155 --> 36:42.157
from "walker texas ranger,"
the cop, chuck norris!

36:42.159 --> 36:45.202
Could this be chuck norris?
That would be amazing.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.871
Oh, my gosh!
That's so good, robin.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.456
Whoever I am,
I'm really hot.

36:49.499 --> 36:52.626
Yes, the baby is ready to go.

36:52.628 --> 36:54.336
Y'all give it up for the baby.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.089
Yo, how does
he even get in that?

36:58.133 --> 36:59.382
That's crazy.

36:59.426 --> 37:00.842
He's "scawwy."

38:20.924 --> 38:23.341

38:23.385 --> 38:25.343
really wanted to see
the wild cards again.

38:25.387 --> 38:29.014
All: Puffer fish,

38:38.275 --> 38:40.358
so I can laugh my butt off.

38:44.823 --> 38:48.158
Oh, this might be
the biggest upset in
"masked singer" history.

38:48.160 --> 38:51.036
- The biggest upset ever?
- Ever!

38:51.079 --> 38:53.580
- Wow.
- I think you guys
are gonna be upset

38:53.623 --> 38:56.624
that you decided
to keep the wild cards
over this performer.

38:56.668 --> 39:00.086
- So she really tricked us.
- Let's start with robin.

39:00.130 --> 39:02.213
- Yes.
- Robin, your first
impression guess...

39:02.257 --> 39:06.092
- Hi, puffer.
- Jessica alba.

39:06.136 --> 39:07.594
- Not bad.
- Are you sticking with that?

39:07.637 --> 39:10.638
Puffer fish in both performances
did a lot of dancing.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.058
- We know jessica alba
was in "honey."
- that's right.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.976
That would be
an exciting reveal for me.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.437
That would be
an exciting reveal. Jenny?

39:17.481 --> 39:18.563
Oh, no, nick.

39:18.607 --> 39:21.483
You chose j. Lo.
Are you sticking with it?

39:21.526 --> 39:23.818
That would be a huge upset
though, right?

39:23.862 --> 39:24.903
I know, audience! I know!

39:25.238 --> 39:28.114
That would be a great upset,
but I think I'm gonna be

39:28.158 --> 39:30.408
totally shocked
when her mask comes off,

39:30.452 --> 39:32.994
but I'm gonna go with
nelly furtado right now.

39:32.996 --> 39:36.790
- All right.
- Not a bad guess.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.833
- Ken?
- Yes, daddy?

39:38.877 --> 39:43.254
- Issa rae.
- Yes.

39:43.298 --> 39:44.422
Not bad.
You sticking with it?

39:44.424 --> 39:47.884
You know,
the space clues led me

39:47.928 --> 39:49.803
to this talented actress,

39:49.846 --> 39:52.680
the star of "drumline,"

39:52.724 --> 39:53.681
zoe saldana.

39:53.975 --> 39:57.519
- Thanks. I agree with you.
- Yep. The star.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.438
Uh, nicole? Paula abdul.

40:02.150 --> 40:04.317
I love me some paula.
I love her so much.

40:04.361 --> 40:06.361
- Sticking with it?
- I'm gonna switch it up.

40:06.405 --> 40:10.031
I heard something in the tone
a little bit more and rapping.

40:10.033 --> 40:13.243
So I was like,
is this someone like monica

40:13.286 --> 40:16.246
- trying to, like, fool us?
- Good guess.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.997
- So I'm gonna go with monica.
- That's a very good guess.

40:18.041 --> 40:21.126
I didn't even think
of that though,
but that's a very good guess.

40:21.128 --> 40:23.211
- Right?
With that tone, right?
- Yeah.

40:23.255 --> 40:26.423
Okay, panel, you've made
your final guesses.

- She did every performance

41:44.836 --> 41:48.004
- No way.
- Oh, that's why the sound
was so different.

41:48.048 --> 41:51.382
Yeah. I've been in a house
the whole pandemic,

41:51.426 --> 41:53.051
and I've seen them
do something fun.

41:53.094 --> 41:54.260
But I had to be
even extra cautious

41:54.304 --> 41:56.095
and do it with the mask
underneath the mask.
