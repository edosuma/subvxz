WEBVTT

00:04.640 --> 00:06.210
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.400 --> 00:09.449
Cesar, my code isn't working.
Can you just let me upstairs?

00:09.600 --> 00:12.120
If you're not on the visitors' list
and you don't have the code,

00:12.145 --> 00:14.201
I have to call up like I would
with anyone else.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.204
- Tasha, what the fuck are you doing?
- I'm so glad "Mrs. St. Patrick"

00:17.360 --> 00:19.567
enjoyed her massage at Eden Roc.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.166
LaKeisha was a mistake.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.209
But I know that this isn't.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.363
You convinced those fuckheads
that Tommy is Ghost.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.249
- You're protecting James.
- What?

00:31.400 --> 00:34.882
I want out of this
and I want Tommy out of this.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.042
Yeah, you make that happen,

00:37.200 --> 00:39.851
or I go in there
and tell your partners

00:40.000 --> 00:41.923
that you're fucking
the real Ghost.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.330

So how do you know James?

02:26.240 --> 02:29.164
It was pretty hot
that night at Truth.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.687
Looked like you were having
a pretty good time.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.163
Up against the wall
is always sick.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.164
Holly. We need to focus.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.527
What would those assholes
at your job think

02:40.720 --> 02:43.041
if they knew you were
fucking a drug dealer?

02:43.200 --> 02:45.123
Those assholes are lawyers.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.762
They're not gonna think anything
without proof.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.684
And I haven't seen
any proof from you

02:50.840 --> 02:52.968
that James St. Patrick is Ghost.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.122
We're running out of time.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.961
Have you ever seen James do anything
illegal with your own eyes?

02:59.120 --> 03:01.726
No, but Tommy's told me
about a lot of stuff he's done.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.962
Hearsay. Doesn't count
in a court of law.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.481
If you can't come up
with something better than that,

03:06.640 --> 03:08.483
I'm not gonna be able
to help Tommy.

03:08.640 --> 03:12.326
He's going to get indicted, Holly.
He's going to go to jail.

03:13.400 --> 03:18.122
Okay... maybe I never saw
James commit a crime,

03:18.280 --> 03:21.204
but I did see him
with a gun once.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.522
When? Where?

03:23.720 --> 03:28.044
One night James came
to Tommy's loft.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.487
He was spooked.
They were whispering.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.529
I couldn't hear
everything that was said,

03:32.680 --> 03:35.729
but I saw James
hand Tommy a gun.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.928
Tommy was supposed
to hide it for him.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.040
- What kind of gun was it?
- I don't know anything

03:40.065 --> 03:42.843
about that kind of shit.
It had that long part on the front.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.321
- A silencer?
- I guess.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.562
When was this?

03:47.720 --> 03:50.200
Do you remember anything
from that night?

03:50.360 --> 03:53.045
A show on TV?
The weather? Anything?

03:54.480 --> 03:57.131
It was the night
of the big snowstorm.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.924
Have you ever heard
of a guy named Rolla?

04:08.120 --> 04:09.804
Sorry, no.

04:15.160 --> 04:19.084
If I find that gun,
will you believe me?

04:19.240 --> 04:20.605
And Tommy can walk?

04:20.760 --> 04:23.525
If you find that gun,
I'll believe you.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.802
Good to have you on board,
brother.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.800
This is a one-time thing
until Milan is back up and running.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.400
Don't be so fucking sure
you want to go back to the cannibal.

04:40.425 --> 04:43.110
I didn't know you had company.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.888
You have this wrong.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.247
We did not go against you.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.922
- We no steal from you.
- Lying piece of shit.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.687
If we came for you,
we would claim it proudly.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.047
We would not hide behind masks.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.641
It is true.

05:09.800 --> 05:13.282
You're usually stupid enough
to brag about your own mistakes.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.603
But only an Albanian
would call me a "gypsy"

05:16.760 --> 05:19.240
and then be foolish enough
to think he could walk away.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.882
- Please, don't.
- Shut this motherfucker up.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.611
Kid's got more stories
than Walt Disney.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.248
- Please, no.
- Speaking of masks...

05:29.400 --> 05:31.880
this will teach you
to cover your face.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.680
Oh, shit!

05:42.880 --> 05:45.087
Oh, shit.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.923
Uncle G. Maybe I should...

06:06.080 --> 06:08.890
I don't know this guy.
The Serb is Tommy's friend.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.601
Maybe you should get going.
I'll catch a ride back with Tommy.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.001
And call your father.
Find out where he is, all right?

06:15.160 --> 06:16.810
Got you.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.204
Guy brings him a duck,
he said, "No, where's the crow at?"

06:34.360 --> 06:38.160
There he is.
Vladimir, meet Ghost.

06:38.320 --> 06:41.563
Ghost, meet Vlad,
our new partner.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.609
Please forgive the mess.

06:44.760 --> 06:49.129
Hate for this to be the first impression
we give to your organization.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.403
Well, we all experience problems
at some point, right, Vladimir?

06:53.560 --> 06:56.080
Part of the game we play.
We're just glad that we could be there

06:56.160 --> 06:57.605
in your time of need.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.240
We want you to join us
for a meeting tomorrow.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.400
Want you to know the people who'll be
moving product through your territory

07:03.425 --> 07:06.608
so you don't accidentally
beef with them on the streets.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.888
- I will be there.
- Good.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.805
As I told Thomas,
I hope you understand

07:11.960 --> 07:14.281
that this is only temporary
until my distributor

07:14.440 --> 07:16.681
- is ready to start back up.
- Fully aware.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.683
But after working with us,
you may decide

07:18.840 --> 07:21.081
it should be
a permanent arrangement.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.483
That is, of course,
if your security is under control.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.610
You can rest assured
that your product

07:27.800 --> 07:30.485
will be safe in our territory.

07:30.640 --> 07:35.009
In fact, I thought you might
like to watch me repay my debt.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.084
The Albanians take the life
of one of my men.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.208
I do the same to them.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.522
Unless you'd rather.
You are my guest.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.284
Didn't bring
a change of clothes.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.768
Well, then...

08:08.680 --> 08:10.560
He cut that motherfucker up
like it was nothing.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.324
No shit, like it was nothing.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.289
He don't give two shits
about a dead Albanian.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.283
These motherfuckers
fight all the time.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.841
Bringing the hostage in front of me,
taking my fucking gun...

08:19.000 --> 08:21.367
Every move was a show of power.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.369
He's not gonna be easy
to control, Tommy.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.160
And I don't know
how he's gonna get along

08:25.185 --> 08:26.843
or play with the others
at this meet-up.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.729
By the way,
you let all of them know?

08:28.880 --> 08:30.484
I told Dre already.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.768
I'll tell the others
when I talk to them today.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.720
You're hanging pretty tight
with this Dre kid.

08:34.745 --> 08:36.727
- What you know about him?
- All I need to know.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.644
He stood tall
with that Serb shit.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.326
Kept a cool head,
only used his gun when it mattered,

08:41.480 --> 08:43.159
and a dead shot
when he pulled the trigger.

08:43.184 --> 08:45.361
He killed the motherfucker
that shot Ruiz's guy Poncho.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.568
Far as I'm concerned,
the kid's 100.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.927
Kanan spoke for him
and he was right, like always.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.529
Okay, but leave the kid
out of this meeting.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.126
With Kanan out of town,
we should have Dre there to represent.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.521
Nah, he's too young to sit
with the big dogs quite yet.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.610
He gaps off, Tommy, we're at war
with that crazy Serbian motherfucker.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.250
Bring the kid
into the inner circle

09:03.400 --> 09:05.084
when his big brother's
there to chaperone.

09:09.120 --> 09:12.329
Mrs. Baker said
that we did the best report...

09:12.480 --> 09:16.769
Tariq is usually very smart,
polite, and disciplined.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.570
Thank you. That's good to hear.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.404
So you can understand my concern

09:20.560 --> 09:24.121
with his suddenly acting
so out of character.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.965
Is he having any
behavioral problems at home?

09:27.120 --> 09:29.566
No, not at all.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.370
Tariq mentioned
that your husband

09:31.520 --> 09:34.126
hasn't been staying at home.

09:34.280 --> 09:38.410
Domestic transition can affect
children in ways we can't see.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.767
My kids are fine.
My family is fine.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.251
Of course they are.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.609
Boys need their fathers.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.842
Maybe your husband
could talk with him.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.843
If he's available.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.482
Thank you, Ms. Chambers.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.803
I didn't realize my donation
paid for all this concern.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.960
I had dinner the other night
with a friend in Homeland.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.361
Felipe Lobos's name
came across their desk.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.330
It turns out that Lobos's
long-running dispute

10:09.480 --> 10:11.608
with the Jimenez Cartel
in Mexico has turned deadly

10:11.760 --> 10:13.285
and Lobos is on the move.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.920
Now, word is
is that he's looking

10:16.080 --> 10:18.162
to secure as much capital
as he can.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.766
Federals think he's gonna be
in New York within a week or two,

10:20.920 --> 10:23.969
so I'm guessing he's gonna hook up
with his distributor, Ghost.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.964
To pick up his money in person
so he doesn't have to go back to Mexico.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.690
That's smart. With hard dollars,

10:28.840 --> 10:30.729
he can hide from the Jimenez
anywhere he wants.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.451
Or buy enough soldiers
to win the war against him.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.967
If we want Lobos, now would be
the time to set a trap.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.771
If we got Lobos in town
engaging in a possible drug deal,

10:38.920 --> 10:41.241
we can get him and Ghost.
It's a win-win.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.164
We can see if Egan's
our guy once and for all

10:43.320 --> 10:45.129
or if that was just bullshit.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.044
This is really great work, Knox.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.850
I'd like to move efforts
into finding out

10:49.040 --> 10:50.760
where and when this meeting
will take place.

10:50.785 --> 10:51.911
Right.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.923
Hey, real quick.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.931
The other night after we talked
to Egan's girlfriend,

11:02.080 --> 11:04.400
I saw you leave the building
and you looked a little upset.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.323
Were you okay?

11:06.480 --> 11:08.562
Problems with Paz, as usual.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.081
I was thinking about coming
by your place, actually.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.163
- Were you home?
- Yep.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.489
Just went home
and went to bed early.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.449
Okay.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.888
- So you're good, then?
- I'm good.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.802
- Jamie, I was thinking...
- Angela.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.849
I'm sorry, just a lot
on my mind. Go ahead.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.365
No, you.

11:44.520 --> 11:48.570
It's Tariq.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.404
He got suspended today
for fighting.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.682
Has that ever happened before?

11:52.840 --> 11:55.684
Never. You know,
he's not like that. He's a good kid.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.605
It's like he's changing right before me
and I'm not there to help him.

11:58.760 --> 12:03.129
Or worse... it's because
I'm not there to help him.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.084
Jamie, I don't want
to fuck up your kids.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.282
You're not. Stop.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.284
I made this choice to be with you
and it's the right choice.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.090
I'll figure out how to help him.

12:12.240 --> 12:15.722
I mean, you know, Tommy
would stop by if he could, but...

12:15.920 --> 12:17.206
Where is Tommy?

12:17.360 --> 12:19.601
He's with his girlfriend,
the redhead.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.087
- Remember I told you?
- I remember.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.926
Besides, I thought we agreed
to not talk about him, right?

12:26.080 --> 12:28.003
Something about
needing a new topic?

12:28.160 --> 12:30.200
Unless, of course,
there's something I need to know.

12:30.225 --> 12:31.848
No.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.968
Anything I need to know?

12:34.120 --> 12:35.690
No.

13:02.680 --> 13:06.162
'Sup, sexy?

13:06.320 --> 13:09.529
- What you looking for?
- Wine opener.

13:11.880 --> 13:15.123
So, you never told me
where you were the other day.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.169
I didn't hear you come in.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.767
I wake up, you're right next to me
like fucking Batman and shit.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.400
I had some thinking to do...
about us.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.961
I said I was sorry
about that Julio thing.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.361
I'm here, aren't I?

13:29.680 --> 13:31.409
Where were you all day?

13:31.560 --> 13:34.245
I was out with Ghost

13:34.400 --> 13:36.402
making us money.

13:40.200 --> 13:44.285
Listen, when you
and Ghost are working,

13:44.440 --> 13:46.010
I want you to be careful, okay?

13:46.160 --> 13:49.050
If you ever got hurt
or arrested,

13:49.200 --> 13:50.804
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.008
I'm too smart to get shot.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.764
Thanks.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.844
No problem.
And I'm too smart to get caught.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.209
- Prison is for assholes.
- That's what I thought

14:01.400 --> 14:03.801
till I was arrested a few times.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.000
I thought they changed
my first name to "Defendant."

14:06.025 --> 14:09.427
I bet the guards
loved seeing you walk their way.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.527
I wouldn't have minded
getting you as a fish.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.401
I would have
stripped you down...

14:20.760 --> 14:22.410
naked,

14:22.560 --> 14:24.130
order you to the ground,

14:24.280 --> 14:29.446
and then I would fuck you
in front of that whole place.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.841
Let everybody know
that you're mine.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.485
You're mine.
You know that, right?

14:43.920 --> 14:46.651
I don't belong to anybody.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.446
No, you're mine.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.642
Just like I said.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.686
You're not gonna hurt me,
are you, Officer?

15:03.880 --> 15:06.247
Not unless you ask nice.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.931
Come here.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.287
Now, I know most of y'all
know each other.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.721
But for those of you that don't,

16:08.880 --> 16:11.042
on Ghost's right is Ruiz.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.971
He runs the Soldado Nation
out of Boogie Down.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.361
The man in red is Drifty.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.329
Him and the Haitians
run North Jersey.

16:18.480 --> 16:21.324
And on my left
is Vladimir and the Serbs.

16:21.480 --> 16:25.007
They hold down Staten Island
and the Lower East Side.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.924
Aren't we missing someone?

16:27.080 --> 16:31.085
Kanan and Dre, who run
the old RSK territory in Queens,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.129
couldn't be here.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.681
You expect us to be here.
They get to call in sick?

16:35.840 --> 16:38.320
Don't matter
what the fuck they do.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.480
This meeting is about
what each and every one of us

16:40.505 --> 16:41.566
is gonna do going forward.

16:41.655 --> 16:43.815
Now you've all been given
extra product on consignment.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.400
Ruiz has re-upped,
a few of you haven't.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.600
I'm here to let you know
the due date's been pushed up,

16:47.640 --> 16:48.641
so now I'm pushing.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.485
How the hell do you expect us
to push more product faster?

16:51.640 --> 16:54.883
We ain't making rockets, Drift.
We slinging dope.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.407
Junkies want their fix regardless.
So you motherfuckers

16:57.560 --> 16:59.847
need to keep your people
out on them corners 24/7.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.650
Pushing the tempo like this
might cause us

17:01.800 --> 17:03.564
to step on each other's toes.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.848
Gentlemen,
the purpose of this meeting

17:06.040 --> 17:07.880
was to introduce you all
and outline territory.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.883
Now, the last I checked,
this New York City.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.884
Take as much fucking territory
as you want, just not from each other.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.247
What if the issue
is outside this room?

17:15.400 --> 17:17.040
If one of you at this table
has a problem,

17:17.119 --> 17:18.690
that problem belongs to us all.

17:18.839 --> 17:21.002
We make more money
together than apart.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.403
If you ain't trying to do that, you
and your crew should step off now.

17:27.640 --> 17:30.849
Very well. Tommy here
will contact you about pickups.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.002
Let's get paid.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.841
Plane? Something
about a plane, right?

17:47.040 --> 17:48.371
That was the Federals.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.921
Lobos's plane took off
without him on it.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.208
Left the airstrip,
no idea where he is.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.805
He's probably traveling by land

17:54.960 --> 17:56.800
to meet the plane somewhere.
It's pretty smart.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.041
So Lobos is officially
on the move.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.247
On his way here.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.326
Going out?

18:08.520 --> 18:11.603
My dad has
a doctor's appointment.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.730
If Mike asks,
I'll be back this afternoon.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.405
Bye, Greg.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.888
"P-M-54-3-5-9."

18:43.120 --> 18:46.363
"P-M-54-3-5-9."

18:49.200 --> 18:51.282
What the fuck?

19:02.760 --> 19:05.445
Did you find it someplace
Tommy'll notice it's missing?

19:05.600 --> 19:07.443
I don't think so.
It was pretty buried.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.204
Pass it to me.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.407
Under the table.

19:27.400 --> 19:31.041
- What?
- This isn't the gun that killed Rolla.

19:31.200 --> 19:35.000
- It's not?
- Rolla was shot with a Walther.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.400
This is a Smith & Wesson.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.370
I told you, I don't know shit
about guns.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.171
Give it back.

19:43.320 --> 19:46.210
Give it the fuck back.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.001
Is there anywhere else
you haven't looked?

19:56.160 --> 19:58.891
Sure, but I have to be careful
he doesn't catch me.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.281
If you can't find it,
we'd better find another way.

20:03.080 --> 20:06.289
You could ask him about Rolla.
I could wire you up.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.807
Wear a wire around Tommy?
Are you out of your mind?

20:08.960 --> 20:10.724
Besides, he doesn't let me
keep my clothes on

20:10.880 --> 20:12.245
long enough to wear
a wire anyway.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.135
We could make your phone
into a recording device.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.720
You could leave it out,
get him talking.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.880
Why do I get the feeling
that you're more freaked out

20:17.905 --> 20:19.794
about this than I am?

20:21.320 --> 20:23.926
Why do you want James
to be Ghost so badly?

20:24.080 --> 20:26.162
I just want the truth.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.120
You want to know
if he's a good guy or bad guy

20:28.160 --> 20:31.050
so you can decide
if you should keep fucking him.

20:31.200 --> 20:35.091
But be real.
Who wants to fuck a good guy?

20:35.240 --> 20:36.571
Okay, fine.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.688
But if I don't prove
James is Ghost,

20:38.880 --> 20:40.530
Tommy's gonna take the hit.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.967
See you here tomorrow night
with the gun...

20:43.120 --> 20:45.327
Something, anything
I can work with.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.323
See you here at 10:00.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.325
Tasha, hey.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.409
What are you doing down here?
Everything okay?

20:59.560 --> 21:03.087
Yeah, you dropped the kids off
with Ghost. Were they okay?

21:03.280 --> 21:06.011
Well, yeah. No, they seemed
pretty happy to see him.

21:08.760 --> 21:12.287
It's just... it's just
hard to believe

21:12.440 --> 21:14.841
this is what things
are like now.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.044
Look...

21:18.200 --> 21:21.044
I know things are complicated.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.131
But I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.045
I mean, you and the kids,
if you need me.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.731
Thanks.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.406
You know, we're not
like any other family.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.922
If I'm gonna be... alone,

21:39.080 --> 21:40.889
I don't just have
to take care of these kids,

21:41.040 --> 21:43.088
I'm gonna have
to protect them, too.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.965
Shawn, I need you
to take me somewhere.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.443
There's something I gotta do.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.362
Fuck.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.689
Dang.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.649
Remind me never
to get on your bad side.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.411
Where'd you learn to shoot
like that, anyway?

22:29.560 --> 22:32.131
Ghost taught me.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.647
He's been good for a few things.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.849
Here, you go ahead.
You take a shot.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.767
Kanan never showed you
how to shoot?

22:46.920 --> 22:48.763
Nah, he wasn't
like that with me.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.208
All right, put the gun down.

22:52.360 --> 22:55.125
Let's take off your jacket.

22:57.040 --> 23:00.010
This is gonna be
your lesson for the day.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.687
All right? Okay.
Pick up the gun.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.560
Make sure to keep
your hand off the trigger.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.965
- Be very careful.
- Okay.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.122
Okay, hold it straight,
all right? All right.

23:11.320 --> 23:14.767
Now, nice and tight.
Put pressure here and aim.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.730
Anticipate the kickback.
Don't flinch.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.967
- Stop laughing.
- I'm sorry.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.920
I'm gonna need more practice if I'm
gonna be as good as you, all right?

23:28.945 --> 23:30.971
Yes, it's okay.
I'm gonna help you. Come on.

23:31.120 --> 23:35.170
Just make sure you hold it
nice and tight right here, okay?

23:35.320 --> 23:38.642
And... you got this.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.921
It's all you.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.968
Good.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.482
All right, I better get going.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.802
The kids'll be home soon.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.931
Like his music.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.283
All right, you guys get going.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.851
I know you got homework to do.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.128
You staying for dinner, Dad?

24:24.080 --> 24:26.845
I know things
are confusing right now

24:27.000 --> 24:30.527
with your mother and I
living apart.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.682
When are you coming home?

24:32.840 --> 24:34.524
Big Mama says you're not.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.524
Come here. Look at me.

24:39.640 --> 24:43.406
I don't have a day or time
on that, okay, baby girl?

24:43.560 --> 24:46.609
But I do know
that we're still a family.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.242
We are one big family.
Don't you forget that.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.448
And your mother and I
love you two and Yasmine

24:52.600 --> 24:54.170
the same as we always did,
all right?

24:54.320 --> 24:56.482
Trust me. You trust me?

24:56.680 --> 24:58.091
Yes.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.722
I love you, baby girl.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.087
Love you, too.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.322
I know things
are rough right now,

25:06.520 --> 25:09.922
but it doesn't give you the right
to go to school and hit somebody.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.684
You listening to me, boy?

25:11.840 --> 25:14.810
Yeah, I heard you.
You said you're not staying.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.210
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:19.360 --> 25:20.930
Thanks for bringing them home.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.010
Kids, go ahead.
Go get ready for dinner, okay?

25:30.480 --> 25:33.689
So... I had that talk
with Tariq.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.929
I don't know if I got through,
but I'll try again.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.686
This thing, Tasha,
it's hard on them.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.888
Yeah, well, I went through it.
They'll be fine.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.644
I'll make sure they're fine.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.963
We'll make sure they're fine.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.681
I was thinking maybe...
I can stay for dinner.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.364
I don't want to confuse the kids.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.962
Maybe next week.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.564
Sure.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.404
You mind if I get a couple items?

26:04.560 --> 26:07.006
Go ahead. Sure.

26:07.160 --> 26:10.050
Thanks, Tasha.

27:03.920 --> 27:07.163
So, things seem to be
rockin' pretty smooth since the meet.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.129
It was a good meeting.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.203
You heard from Lobos
about a date for the drop?

27:11.360 --> 27:12.600
No, but I know it's soon.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.240
What about Angela?
You talk to her?

27:15.440 --> 27:18.523
- Ghost, eat something.
- I haven't gotten anything out of her.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.727
She won't mention anything

27:19.880 --> 27:21.680
and there's no new files
in her crib, nothing.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.803
Well... keep an eye on her.

27:24.960 --> 27:29.090
Don't forget, no matter how tight
that pussy is, she's still the enemy.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.844
You told Holly we'd be here?

27:32.040 --> 27:34.611
Oh, shit. She's been itching
to get out of the house.

27:34.760 --> 27:37.206
I thought we'd be done by now.
Hey, babe.

27:37.360 --> 27:40.648
Hi..

27:40.840 --> 27:43.127
You're early.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.522
James, didn't realize
you'd be joining us.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.001
Funny, I wasn't
expecting you either, Holly.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.528
- You want some wine?
- You got anything stronger?

27:59.680 --> 28:01.682
- What, like a Scotch?
- That'd be great.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.889
- Where's our fucking waiter?
- Out back.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.008
You stay put here.
I'll track him down.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.524
- The fuck you still doing here?
- He's been so nice lately,

28:11.680 --> 28:13.400
I haven't been able
to pick a goddamn fight.

28:13.555 --> 28:16.240
Don't even try to play me, Holly.
I'm warning you, leave tonight.

28:16.395 --> 28:19.249
- I need more time.
- Nope, time's up.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.846
I told you, you gonna leave
one way or the other.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.930
Fine.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.842
I need the money
and the train ticket.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.007
Meet me at Truth.

28:35.160 --> 28:38.084
Be there at 10:00 when we open.

28:38.240 --> 28:41.005
Then I never want to see
your face again.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.289
Here you are.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.608
- You outta here?
- Oh, yeah, I'm up.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.880
I figured I'd leave you two
lovebirds alone, you know?

28:54.960 --> 28:56.610
Give you some time
to enjoy your lady.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.764
- All right. Peace out, brother.
- Peace out, brother.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.962
I'll catch you later, too.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.290
Hey, man, you can do all that
Spanish shit when I'm around, man.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.920
I like knowing
what people are saying.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.729
Then you should learn
"el Spanish."

29:34.880 --> 29:36.723
You're gonna need it
in a few years anyway.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.922
This is our country now.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.124
What's up, man? How you feelin'?

29:52.280 --> 29:54.248
Been better, man.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.243
But you killed the motherfucker
who shot me.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.368
Yeah, I clipped him.

29:58.560 --> 30:02.087
- I won't forget, hermano.
- Appreciate that.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.971
I won't forget it, either.
But I thought I'd do you a favor,

30:05.120 --> 30:08.522
let you know that Ghost and Tommy
had a meeting with the whole group.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.205
You weren't invited.

30:10.360 --> 30:13.125
Now, the way I see it,
you stood up the other night.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.806
There's no doubt
about that, hermano.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.287
So it's not about you.

30:18.440 --> 30:21.011
Who could it be
that Ghost doesn't trust?

30:22.720 --> 30:24.449
Tell me about that guy Kanan
you work for.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.409
I owe him a debt.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.245
Ghost and Tommy
have their own way of doing things.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.449
I like the independence
and the product... can't complain.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.449
But bringing in the Serbian?

30:36.320 --> 30:39.164
I'm not sure.

30:39.320 --> 30:42.961
Kanan wants to be in business
with Ghost and Tommy?

30:43.120 --> 30:46.124
He knows 'em from way back.
He's loyal. So am I.

30:46.320 --> 30:49.483
And we respect that.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.290
I just want you to know
that from now on,

30:51.440 --> 30:54.364
you need anything,
Soldado Nation has your back.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.084
Not Kanan. You.

31:16.280 --> 31:19.124
Red! I'm back!

31:20.600 --> 31:23.046
Come here.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.567
- I got something for you.
- What?

31:32.280 --> 31:34.044
Did you steal this
from somebody?

31:34.240 --> 31:36.208
No, I'm not you.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.362
It's my grandmother's.

31:38.520 --> 31:41.569
My ma used to hock it all the time
when I was growing up.

31:41.720 --> 31:44.326
But she always bought it back.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.687
Does she know
you're giving it to me?

31:46.880 --> 31:49.963
No. You like it?

31:53.080 --> 31:55.651
You see? It's like
I was saying before...

31:55.800 --> 31:57.609
Now everybody'll know
that you're mine.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.202
Are you saying that you wanna...

32:02.360 --> 32:05.045
No, I... I mean, not...

32:05.200 --> 32:07.521
I just meant... not...

32:07.680 --> 32:09.523
Not now?

32:09.680 --> 32:11.967
I just want you
to wear it, okay?

32:12.120 --> 32:15.602
So it's like a promise ring?
Like we're 15?

32:15.760 --> 32:17.250
Want me to take it back?

32:17.400 --> 32:19.482
No.

32:19.640 --> 32:22.246
I love it.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.162
I love you.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.290
Fuck. Baby, I gotta
go out for a while.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.442
Tommy...

32:53.680 --> 32:54.727
thank you.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.882
Baby.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.322
I'm gonna need
some more thanking,

33:01.480 --> 33:04.529
so you just...

33:04.680 --> 33:06.728
hold that thought.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.290
- Don't be upset.
- Okay, yeah.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.040
I'm... it's not my fault
you can't shoot.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.855
Hey, everybody's not
MacGyver on the first time.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.640
You walkin' out the gate
shootin' everything.

33:24.665 --> 33:26.289
I'm glad I was there
because I don't know

33:26.480 --> 33:27.960
if you were gonna
make it by yourself.

33:27.985 --> 33:29.524
Watch, watch. Next time...

33:29.640 --> 33:31.840
- What? What's gonna happen?
- Hey, quiet... quiet down.

33:31.865 --> 33:33.562
Yasmine is sleeping.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.449
Well, thanks
for a nice day, Shawn,

33:35.600 --> 33:37.284
and for staying for dinner.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.520
I think the kids really enjoyed
having you over, too.

33:39.545 --> 33:40.685
It was my pleasure.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.840
You know I always have
a good time with them, so...

33:42.880 --> 33:45.120
Yeah, well, they're all tuckered out
and ready for sleep.

33:45.145 --> 33:48.761
Maybe we all should
call it an early night.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.850
Right. I'm gonna get going.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.970
- Night, y'all.
- Good night.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.882
Things getting any better
with you and Ghost?

34:01.040 --> 34:02.883
He made his choice.

34:03.040 --> 34:06.328
He been lurkin' around here like
he wants to come back home, Tasha.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.761
Maybe you should
try and make it work.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.047
Where are you gonna find
another one like him?

34:11.199 --> 34:13.009
Okay, you're
defending Ghost now?

34:13.159 --> 34:17.370
You kicked him out right into
the arms of another woman, Tasha.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.362
He's going to be with her.

34:19.520 --> 34:23.366
You know what comes next?
Marriage, a baby.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.842
A whole second family.
He will forget all about you.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.724
I'm going to bed, Mama.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.241
You have no idea what it's like
being a single mother.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.527
How hard it is.

34:33.679 --> 34:36.080
And that boy you're playing with
ain't gonna help you either.

34:36.105 --> 34:38.444
Maybe he can rotate your tires,

34:38.600 --> 34:40.360
but he ain't gonna
help you raise these kids.

34:40.385 --> 34:41.924
Even if I have
to do it by myself,

34:42.080 --> 34:44.047
I'll do a better job
than you ever did.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.400
- What...!
- You think you so big and bad

34:47.425 --> 34:49.043
you don't need nobody, Tasha?

34:49.199 --> 34:52.487
You ain't strong or smart enough
to do this alone.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.924
You think you gonna spend the night
in my house after that?

35:01.560 --> 35:04.211
Yes, I do.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.886
'Cause who else gonna help
feed and change the baby

35:07.080 --> 35:09.401
while you make breakfast
for the twins tomorrow morning?

35:11.120 --> 35:13.441
Good night, Tasha.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.168
I see you came to your senses.

36:13.320 --> 36:16.130
You didn't give me
much of a choice, now, did you?

36:22.080 --> 36:24.481
Your money, new ID,
and train ticket.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.722
You stole Tommy's
grandmother's ring?

36:34.480 --> 36:36.608
Yeah.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.888
I guess I did.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.281
I'll let you keep it.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.330
That way, when Tommy
realizes it's missing,

36:50.480 --> 36:52.847
he'll know what you really are.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.724

Come on, man, we've had
a good night. Partake.

38:04.840 --> 38:09.209
Stern wants all the key numbers
in his hands first thing in the morning.

38:09.360 --> 38:11.806
He's working you hard.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.803
Stern is a tougher boss than me.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.041
Well...

38:15.200 --> 38:17.851
I get it. You're loyal.
That's what I always liked about you.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.126
Appreciate that.

38:19.280 --> 38:22.682
You know, this... this whole thing's
a little weird for me, right?

38:22.840 --> 38:24.683
Can't say I ever saw us
getting to this point.

38:24.840 --> 38:27.923
Yeah, but you're handling it like a pro.
I appreciate that.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.525
Too bad Stern wouldn't notice.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.569
Well, you know,
he runs a big business, man.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.200
There's no way he can
keep a close eye

38:33.320 --> 38:34.680
on every person
that works for him.

38:34.705 --> 38:36.125
Good luck.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.282
But it's not the club
that's got him so out of it.

38:38.440 --> 38:41.046
Personal shit?

38:41.200 --> 38:43.248
I've already said too much.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.040
What's the big deal?
He's not here, is he?

38:45.065 --> 38:46.485
The room's not miked.

38:46.640 --> 38:47.926
He can't hear us. Shoot

38:51.120 --> 38:52.600
He and Madeline
are getting a divorce.

38:52.680 --> 38:54.284
No shit?

38:54.440 --> 38:56.647
Stern hasn't been the most
faithful of husbands,

38:56.800 --> 38:58.643
if you know what I mean.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.201
- No shit.
- Yeah, he says she's really pissed.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.971
It's gonna be really expensive
and really nasty.

39:04.120 --> 39:06.646
Why do you think he's been
out of the country so much?

39:09.000 --> 39:10.650
Hiding his assets.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.844
Hold that thought, Kantos.

39:15.480 --> 39:18.370
I need to take this.
I'll give you some privacy.

39:18.520 --> 39:22.206
- Thanks for the drink.
- You got it.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.247
We still on for tonight?

39:31.400 --> 39:33.721
I'm sorry, Jamie, no.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.042
A pile of work
just landed in my lap.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.850
You know you keep
telling me not to worry,

39:38.000 --> 39:39.331
you don't want to talk about it,

39:39.520 --> 39:41.124
but when you say
you got a pile of work,

39:41.280 --> 39:43.647
how can I not think
it's about Tommy, Angie?

39:43.800 --> 39:47.327
You know I can't tell you anything
about the case against him.

39:47.480 --> 39:51.041
- I've said too much already.
- It's too damn late.

39:51.240 --> 39:53.368
How am I supposed to trust you
if you can't trust me?

39:53.520 --> 39:56.240
I did trust you. That's how we
got into this mess in the first place.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.362
- "Did"?
- What?

39:58.520 --> 40:00.807
"Did," past tense.
You said you "did" trust me.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.961
What... don't read into that.
It's just complicated.

40:06.120 --> 40:08.726
Yeah, it's very complicated,
Angela,

40:08.920 --> 40:10.480
especially when we can't
see each other.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.489
You mean when we can't
meet up to have sex.

40:12.680 --> 40:16.844
No, that's not what I mean.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.606
Jamie, maybe we should...

40:20.840 --> 40:24.970
- What?
- I don't know.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.244
Take a break until this whole
Tommy thing blows over.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.165
Angie, come on, no.
We'll work it out.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.561
Look, this is not a conversation
we should have

40:37.720 --> 40:40.166
over the phone anyway, okay?
What time do you get home?

40:41.880 --> 40:43.882
I don't know.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.730
I'll call you tomorrow.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.851
Good night.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.202
Good night.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.330
This is Holly.
You know what to do.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.562
Holly, you didn't show tonight.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.485
I need to know where you are.
Call me back.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.449
- Yo, G?
- Yeah?

41:25.600 --> 41:27.602
The Serb is still asking
a lot of questions.

41:27.760 --> 41:29.000
Tommy, yeah, I told you, man.

41:29.160 --> 41:32.160
We just gotta stay a couple of steps
ahead of this motherfucker, that's all.

41:32.185 --> 41:34.162
Now, Vlad didn't say
he knew it was us.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.402
- Yeah.
- But I think we better watch our backs.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.320
- You know what I'm saying?
- All right, bet.

41:38.476 --> 41:39.876
All right,
I'll hit you up tomorrow.

41:39.996 --> 41:41.683
- Later.
- Later.

41:46.920 --> 41:50.527
Angela, I think we should prepare
to go for an arrest warrant on Egan.

41:50.680 --> 41:53.480
I want you to work with Knox and
swear out an affidavit with the judge.

41:53.505 --> 41:56.682
- Saxe will go apeshit.
- Saxe will handle Lobos if we get him.

41:56.840 --> 42:00.322
You do Egan. He's your suspect.
You get to go to the hoop.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.120
And I just got something else
that could help.

42:03.145 --> 42:04.569
27th Precinct just called.

42:04.720 --> 42:07.200
You flagged Tommy Egan's
associates in the NYPD database?

42:07.360 --> 42:09.488
- I did.
- Well, they just arrested one of them

42:09.640 --> 42:12.166
and saw your note to call us.
James St. Patrick.

42:12.320 --> 42:16.484
Guess I better
go down there and check that out.

42:16.640 --> 42:19.041
No, you stay. I'll go.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.009
If that's okay with you, Mike.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.731
Either way. If they've got
something good on him,

42:23.880 --> 42:25.480
let's see if he'll talk
for a walk, okay?

42:25.505 --> 42:27.109
Right.

42:31.400 --> 42:33.607
- I'm fine.
- Fuck fine.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.081
You are not fine.
Were you drinking?

42:36.280 --> 42:38.442
I wasn't drunk, okay?

42:38.600 --> 42:41.809
I needed some information on Stern.
I needed to loosen Kantos' tongue.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.327
- It worked.
- Does this look like it worked to you?

42:44.480 --> 42:46.130
- Tasha, I wasn't drunk, okay?
- Okay.

42:46.215 --> 42:47.695
Did I want a ride
to the station? Yes.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.400
So I could give myself
a little extra time.

42:49.425 --> 42:51.706
Now the blood test will come back
good and we can go home.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.131
What's up?

42:55.280 --> 42:57.169
You called her?

42:57.320 --> 42:59.163
Looking for James St. Patrick.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.281
Down the hall,
second door to your right.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.523
I don't know how she knew.

43:20.240 --> 43:23.926
Blood test results are back.
You were right, Mr. St. Patrick.

43:24.120 --> 43:26.043
Turns out you weren't
over the legal limit.

43:26.200 --> 43:28.248
- So I'm free to go home?
- Yeah.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.051
Assume your wife's
gonna give you a ride?

43:31.200 --> 43:33.202
I sure am.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.248
<i>'</i> - Why her?

43:49.400 --> 43:52.688
- Tasha, don't...
- No, seriously. Why her?

43:54.400 --> 43:56.926
I've known Angela
since we were kids.

43:58.120 --> 44:00.566
I never thought
I'd see her again.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.131
Then she came
in the club one night.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.448
Wait... so, wait the fuck...

44:04.600 --> 44:09.367
So you broke up our entire family
over a chick from high school?

44:09.520 --> 44:12.410
- I'm telling you, I never got over her.
- What the fuck was I?

44:12.560 --> 44:14.130
"Good enough"?

44:14.280 --> 44:17.011
- What, so... what, you settled for me?
- It's not like that, Tasha.

44:17.160 --> 44:19.481
It's exactly like that.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.400
Now I see.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.767
Now I see why you
couldn't leave her alone.

44:27.720 --> 44:30.291
It's not the only reason.

44:36.720 --> 44:39.690
Angela is a US Attorney.

44:39.840 --> 44:42.844
She's a federal prosecutor,
specifically drug crimes,

44:43.000 --> 44:45.844
and now she's fucking close
to arresting Tommy.

44:46.920 --> 44:50.208
Tash! Tash!

44:52.560 --> 44:54.722
Get off of me.

44:56.160 --> 44:59.004
She's gonna arrest Tommy.

44:59.160 --> 45:02.767
This bitch you brought into our lives
is a fucking cop.

45:02.920 --> 45:06.322
I stayed in it.
I took her to Miami to watch her,

45:06.480 --> 45:07.891
figure out what she knows.

45:08.040 --> 45:10.327
And I'm telling you now

45:10.480 --> 45:12.448
because her investigation
is ramping up.

45:12.640 --> 45:14.051
She started
to pull away from me.

45:14.200 --> 45:16.441
No, she hasn't.

45:16.600 --> 45:19.171
I saw the way
she looked at you tonight.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.529
She loves you.

45:22.680 --> 45:25.490
She fucking loves you.

45:27.640 --> 45:29.722
I saw the way
you looked at her, too.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.528
You love her right back.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.402
You know, even after
she gets Tommy,

45:38.560 --> 45:40.642
she's gonna come for you.

45:40.840 --> 45:42.330
And me.

45:42.480 --> 45:45.768
What's gonna happen to the kids
when we go to jail, Ghost?

45:45.920 --> 45:49.322
Have you thought about that?

45:49.480 --> 45:51.244
I've thought about everything.

45:51.400 --> 45:54.006
Bullshit.

45:55.600 --> 45:57.762
I got to figure out
my next move.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.081
- Keep fucking her.
- What?

46:11.680 --> 46:15.002
Tasha, I don't even know
if that's an option.

46:15.160 --> 46:19.006
I saw the bitch.
Trust me. It's an option.

46:20.280 --> 46:23.807
Whatever this thing
between you two is,

46:23.960 --> 46:26.122
it's gonna work in our favor.

46:28.040 --> 46:29.690
You're gonna...

46:29.840 --> 46:33.561
No, we're gonna figure out
how to protect our business.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.121
How to protect our family.

46:36.280 --> 46:39.841
She loves you,
so she will protect you.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.361
She's probably already protecting you
in ways you don't even know.

46:48.240 --> 46:50.447
So you need to keep her happy.

46:50.600 --> 46:54.685
You keep fucking that bitch
until I tell you to stop.

46:58.080 --> 47:00.481
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:03.320 --> 47:05.561
- Is everything okay?
- As good as it can be.

47:05.720 --> 47:07.768
They released him.
I dropped him off at the hotel.

47:07.920 --> 47:09.410
So what happened?

47:09.560 --> 47:11.600
I really don't want
to talk about it tonight, Shawn.

47:11.625 --> 47:13.328
Really, I'm sorry.

47:13.480 --> 47:17.201
Can you take the car
to the shop in the morning?

47:17.360 --> 47:18.850
I think we need
to replace the bumper.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.049
Yeah, no, sure. I'll take a look.

47:25.920 --> 47:28.082

- Hey.
- Where's Holly Weaver?

49:16.440 --> 49:18.044
What are you talking about?

49:18.200 --> 49:20.282
What the hell did Tommy do
to Holly Weaver?

49:20.440 --> 49:22.647
I've been to her apartment,
I tracked her phone.

49:22.800 --> 49:24.848
I found it in a garbage can
on 37th Street.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.685
- Holly's gone.
- How do you know Holly?

49:29.400 --> 49:31.687
Her name came up in the course
of my investigation.

49:31.840 --> 49:35.970
You seem awfully worried
for just a name, though.

49:38.800 --> 49:41.485
I think your friend
Tommy killed her.

49:41.640 --> 49:45.326
I'm gonna make sure
he pays for it.

49:45.480 --> 49:47.642
Tommy didn't kill Holly.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.847
How could you
possibly know that?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.321
They got in a fight.

50:00.480 --> 50:03.529
About what, I don't know.
Do you?

50:03.680 --> 50:05.011
No.

50:05.160 --> 50:07.208
I sent her out of town,
gave her some money.

50:07.360 --> 50:09.522
She's alive.

50:12.760 --> 50:15.525
I'm not gonna find her, am I?

50:17.240 --> 50:20.722
Depends on whether or not
she wants to be found.

50:23.120 --> 50:25.566
But now that you're here...

50:28.360 --> 50:30.886
you wanna stay?

50:31.040 --> 50:33.930
Angie, don't give me that look.
I'm a good guy.

50:37.200 --> 50:40.090
I helped a girl get out of town
that wanted to leave, that's all.

50:40.240 --> 50:43.289
Or you got rid
of a federal witness.

50:53.440 --> 50:55.124
Or you're wrong.

50:55.320 --> 50:58.483
You ever thought about that?

50:58.640 --> 51:00.802
What if you're wrong?

51:02.720 --> 51:05.610
About everything?

51:05.760 --> 51:08.286
I'm not.

51:08.440 --> 51:10.442
Yeah, but...

51:11.960 --> 51:14.850
we're not gonna figure that out
tonight, are we?

51:15.960 --> 51:17.962
Stay awhile.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.760
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

51:36.240 --> 51:38.288
Where you been?

51:41.760 --> 51:44.331
Went for a walk.

52:25.320 --> 52:27.243
Baby?

52:27.400 --> 52:29.880
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.811
Just feels good, that's all.

52:35.640 --> 52:37.483
Hey-

52:43.080 --> 52:45.208
Oh, yeah.

52:45.360 --> 52:47.886
- One thing is missing.
- No.

52:51.240 --> 52:52.765
You want me to arrest you again?

52:52.920 --> 52:54.570
Nope.

52:56.560 --> 52:58.050
My turn.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.526
Say, you crazy, baby.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.684
Okay, all right.

53:14.560 --> 53:16.722
Baby...?

53:20.880 --> 53:23.884
What do you think
about just picking up

53:24.040 --> 53:26.520
and starting all over
somewhere else?

53:26.720 --> 53:28.210
What?

53:28.360 --> 53:29.964
What?

53:30.120 --> 53:31.804
Why would you wanna
go somewhere else?

53:31.960 --> 53:34.566
Everything we want is here.
This New York City, baby!

53:34.720 --> 53:37.200
I know.

53:37.400 --> 53:39.084
But it could be great to be
somewhere else

53:39.240 --> 53:41.049
where no one knows us.

53:41.200 --> 53:43.441
You know, a fresh start?

53:43.600 --> 53:46.126
What are you talking about?
All our friends are here.

53:46.320 --> 53:47.810
Our family.

53:47.960 --> 53:50.725
I don't really have any friends.

53:51.960 --> 53:54.440
And I don't have any family.

53:54.600 --> 53:57.410
Just you.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.931
Holly, what's going on?

54:08.320 --> 54:10.607
- It's okay.
- Listen.

54:12.960 --> 54:16.521
Listen, Tommy, the... the Feds
called me in for questioning.

54:16.680 --> 54:18.480
- What the fuck?
- They were trying to have me

54:18.520 --> 54:20.801
flip on you, but I wouldn't say
a fucking thing about you.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.200
I would never do that.
You know me.

54:22.240 --> 54:24.083
How could you not
fucking tell me about this?

54:24.280 --> 54:26.851
I'm trying to, I am.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.607
Look, that bitch Angela,

54:30.760 --> 54:32.683
the Fed that Ghost is fucking...

54:32.840 --> 54:36.765
- Yeah?
- Told me that if...

54:36.960 --> 54:38.320
That if I could
help her get Ghost,

54:38.440 --> 54:41.364
she would make sure
that we would be safe.

54:41.520 --> 54:44.364
"Safe"?

54:44.520 --> 54:47.000
What the fuck
are you talking about?!

54:47.160 --> 54:49.481
Tommy...

54:52.160 --> 54:55.323
I can save us
by giving them Ghost.

54:55.520 --> 54:58.569
When you came in here before,
I was looking for the gun

54:58.720 --> 55:00.484
that Ghost gave you.

55:00.640 --> 55:04.008
Did he... did he kill somebody
named Rolla?

55:04.160 --> 55:05.730
If we can give them

55:05.880 --> 55:08.884
the gun that he used,
if we can prove that he'd do that,

55:09.040 --> 55:10.883
you can walk.

55:14.240 --> 55:17.687
Fuck! Get these
fucking cuffs off of me!

55:19.360 --> 55:21.681
I'm trying to save us.

55:21.880 --> 55:24.929
By, what, ratting out Ghost?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

55:26.320 --> 55:28.322
Who do you choose?

55:29.360 --> 55:32.204
Ghost or me?

55:39.360 --> 55:41.169
Get over here.

55:43.560 --> 55:46.848
Get over here, now.

55:54.520 --> 55:57.091
Holly, where's the fucking key?

55:59.120 --> 56:00.884
You little fucking thief.

56:01.080 --> 56:03.242
Get the fuck over here
with that key now.

56:03.400 --> 56:05.767
Get over here,
you fucking bitch!

56:05.960 --> 56:08.088
You fucking dirty little thief.

56:08.240 --> 56:09.571
You fucking whore!

56:09.760 --> 56:13.651
You fucking... get back here!

56:13.800 --> 56:16.280
Holly, get back here,
you fucking bitch!

56:16.440 --> 56:18.886
You fucking cunt!

56:19.040 --> 56:20.724
Get back here!

56:20.880 --> 56:24.566
Holly, don't you fucking leave!

56:24.720 --> 56:27.200
Holly!
