00:08.383 --> 00:11.678
An anthem is a song
that should encapsulate

00:11.761 --> 00:14.806
the spirit, dedication,
and honor of a group.

00:14.889 --> 00:19.477
And I can think of no better instrument
that reflects these things

00:19.561 --> 00:21.229
than the fife.

00:21.312 --> 00:24.899
It was an instrument that was used
during the Revolutionary War

00:24.983 --> 00:25.984
to rally the troops.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.944
-Oh.
-This is my proposal

00:28.028 --> 00:29.779
for the Space Force anthem.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.550
Nice.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.052
-Very nice.
-I didn't see it coming.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.470
Thank you. Thank you.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.638
So you play the fife?

00:55.722 --> 00:56.556
I do.

00:56.639 --> 00:59.392
Well, the fife
is just such a shrill sound.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.728
It's a horrible-sounding instrument.

01:01.811 --> 01:04.147
When you play it alone like that,

01:04.230 --> 01:06.858
it's very alarming to the ears.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.611
It calls to mind Custer's Last Stand.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.739
Me, I would put a cork in it.

01:12.822 --> 01:16.409
Okay. Okay. All right. All right.
Got it. Thank you for your opinion.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.328
Anybody else have an idea?

01:18.411 --> 01:20.246
Well, let's pop that
on the board first. Right?

01:20.330 --> 01:21.456
I… I wouldn't.

01:21.539 --> 01:22.665
Fife.

01:22.749 --> 01:23.666
Great.

01:23.750 --> 01:27.504
Well, my proposal
takes a more minimalistic flavor.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.306
-Hmm. Mmm. Wha…?

01:39.349 --> 01:41.059
That's… That's…

01:41.142 --> 01:43.645
What is that? That's a sound.
That's not an anthem.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.605
Yeah, but the sound mimics

01:45.688 --> 01:49.150
the stellar vibrations of the sun.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.320
-Just… Just thinking out of the box.
-Let's put her on the board. Huh?

01:52.403 --> 01:55.573
You don't need to think outside the box.
The box is fine.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.408
No need to tamper with the box.

01:57.492 --> 02:01.830
Well, no, but now
even TV shows don't have themes.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.624
They… They often employ
just a brief sound.

02:04.707 --> 02:07.252
Box is okay.
Leave the box alone. How about that?

02:07.335 --> 02:09.629
Brevity can be highly evocative.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.674
We don't need… We don't…
Just… Let's put the box aside.

02:12.757 --> 02:17.762
What if we do something that is both
outside the box and also forward-thinking?

02:17.846 --> 02:21.975
Like what if we had Trixie Mattel
or Shangela singing on a track?

02:22.058 --> 02:24.644
Let's just go with that.
Everybody hates the fife.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.521
Let's go with Shnang… Shnangela.

02:26.604 --> 02:29.899
Dad, these are two awesome
and very talented drag queens.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.109
You would be so lucky.

02:31.192 --> 02:33.486
Honey, you're an intern.
You don't have a say. I'm sorry.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.238
Don't even put those on.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.073
You all have incredible ideas.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.074
These are all great.

02:38.158 --> 02:42.370
But throw 'em in the garbage
because I have the winner.

02:42.912 --> 02:47.000
Ladies and gentlemen, in my hand,
I have indie rock darlings Wilco

02:47.083 --> 02:50.420
who have made a demo for us
for the Space Force anthem.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.214
Sir, you may wanna
put your fife down for this one.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.352
-Catchy.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.232
Closets?

03:12.817 --> 03:14.235
-That's us.
Yeah. Yeah.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.612
-Wha…?

03:15.695 --> 03:18.364
Wait. Wait. Why are they singing
about cabinets and shelves?

03:18.448 --> 03:22.952
Right. So, um, Wilco thought
that Space Force was a group of people

03:23.036 --> 03:26.247
that come to your house
and offer storage solutions,

03:26.331 --> 03:28.875
make everything
a little bit cleaner, and, um…

03:28.958 --> 03:30.210
I did not correct them.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.170
Hmm…

03:32.879 --> 03:33.922
-Okay.
-All right.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.924
I've got one more.
This is called "Seven Stars."

03:36.007 --> 03:36.841
No. No one--

03:48.436 --> 03:51.022
Brad, General Naird put me
in the back of the staff photo,

03:51.105 --> 03:54.234
which has to be a mistake because
I set the whole thing up, so let's--

03:54.317 --> 03:55.235
No, you're in the back.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.445
I'm in the back too.
Back-row buddies.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.323
Don't say that.
Is he in? Can I talk to him?

04:00.406 --> 04:03.117
Uh, no. Uh, he's getting his car serviced.

04:03.910 --> 04:09.040
And is, uh, definitely not, uh,
someplace else that's not that.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.751
Right. He's getting his car serviced.

04:11.834 --> 04:12.835
-All right.
-Yeah.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.255
Great. You give me a little ringy
when he comes in, okay?

04:15.338 --> 04:16.589
Oh yeah. Will do.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.508
-Okay.
-Call you first.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.093
Okay. All right.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.888
Are you kidding me?

04:23.972 --> 04:26.557
Are you kidding me?
Guess who just texted.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.725
-Who?
-General Naird.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.018
Oh, he did?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.437
You're off the hook, my man.
He told me exactly where he was.

04:31.521 --> 04:35.233
Oh wow. I'm sorry, Tony.
You know, he asked me not to, you know.

04:35.316 --> 04:38.152
He said the same thing to me.
"Don't tell anybody. Make sure--"

04:38.236 --> 04:39.862
But now we both know he's at the…

04:39.946 --> 04:41.614
Doctor's appointment.

04:41.698 --> 04:45.076
He's at the doctor's appointment.
Yeah. That's what he just texted me.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.494
Yeah, yeah. Ha!

04:46.577 --> 04:47.620
Ha.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.330
-Our little secret, right?
-You bet.

04:51.416 --> 04:55.211
In divorce, the feelings of guilt,
shame, and loneliness are common.

04:55.295 --> 04:59.299
It is important to start grieving first,
and then you can begin the healing.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.634
And that's the goal
of our biweekly sessions.

05:05.179 --> 05:06.180
Nope.

05:12.437 --> 05:15.231
Okay, but what you're saying is
he is <i>not </i>at a doctor's appointment?

05:15.315 --> 05:18.109
No. Everybody knows
that "doctor's appointment" really means

05:18.192 --> 05:20.737
you're out looking for another job.
And you know what that means?

05:20.820 --> 05:21.779
Mm-mm.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.157
Naird is getting transferred. Yes.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.784
Rumor is, new POTUS
is already looking for his replacement.

05:26.868 --> 05:30.163
Shit. I can't handle this place
without the general.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.498
But they wouldn't… they wouldn't
do that to him. Right? No.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.458
-No.
-No, right?

05:33.541 --> 05:36.419
No, they wouldn't do that to him.
If history has taught us anything,

05:36.502 --> 05:39.922
it's that the U.S. government
treats everybody fairly and equitably.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.550
I'm just remembering.
They almost left you on the moon to die.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.885
-Yeah, I'm aware.
-You, a hero.

05:43.968 --> 05:46.095
-They're like, "Let her die. Who cares?"
-I was there.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.347
You gotta wake up.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.058
There's a good chance
that Space Force is going extinct.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.977
-So we gotta find new gigs. Now.
-What's this "we" business?

05:53.061 --> 05:55.355
I'm so happy you brought it up.
This is what I'm thinking.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.106
A book deal. <i>Black on the Moon.</i>

05:57.190 --> 06:00.485
Twenty weeks minimum
on the best-seller list. You're welcome.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.613
No, I told you, I am done with the moon.
No more moon shit.

06:06.115 --> 06:08.201
I have a, uh… I have a secret too.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.704
I'm going to a doctor's appointment
today as well.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.333
-What are you talking about?
-Like, a fake…

06:15.416 --> 06:18.461
-I got it. What are you talking about?
-It's a real estate seminar.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.089
Oh God, can't you just see me?

06:21.172 --> 06:23.341
Drinking mango martinis
on a beach in Hawaii

06:23.424 --> 06:25.718
after selling houses all day?
Oh! It'll be perfect.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.888
Sounds fantastic. But what about me?
I was supposed to make money off of you.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.390
You are such a parasite.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.601
Well, every parasite needs
a wonderful, intelligent intestine

06:33.684 --> 06:35.395
just to live off of for a little bit.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.023
That's beautiful. Know what?
You should come with me to the seminar.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.234
-I think you'd be great at selling houses.
-Really?

06:41.317 --> 06:43.778
-It's all about territories, right?
-Like we're drug lords.

06:43.861 --> 06:46.280
-No, not, like, bad though. Not criminal.
-Okay.

06:46.364 --> 06:49.033
Just, like, certain real estate agents
have different areas of a city.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.326
-Okay.
-Chan.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.540
Hey.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.708
Sorry, just wanted you to know.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.920
I got a call from a colleague at SpaceX,

07:01.462 --> 07:06.801
and they are seeking a chief scientist
for a new project,

07:06.884 --> 07:09.137
and they're doing it very discreetly.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.055
You thinking about checking it out?

07:13.057 --> 07:14.851
I am.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.353
I mean, at this point, what is my legacy?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.272
It's not putting a man on Mars.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.149
Right. Right.

07:21.232 --> 07:25.403
I just wanted you to know that
I told them I would not even interview

07:25.486 --> 07:28.156
unless they took us both
as a package deal.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.866
Wow. Thank you.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.743
It feels good to be wanted.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.706
It would be my honor
to be the Krillin to your Goku.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.503
Krillin and Goku are two characters
from <i>Dragon Ball Z.</i> It's a Japanese anime.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.839
They're kind of like
the Asian Batman and Robin.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.633
Well, you keep me young, Dr. Chan.

07:51.804 --> 07:52.763
Brad, what do we got?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.974
Okay. You got
the Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting,

07:55.057 --> 07:56.476
and then at 16:00 hours,

07:56.559 --> 07:59.061
the photographer
from <i>Time</i> magazine is here

07:59.145 --> 08:01.481
to take a picture
of the staff for their cover.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.609
The cover of <i>Time</i> magazine! Space Force.

08:04.692 --> 08:05.860
-This is big.
-Big.

08:05.943 --> 08:09.197
I dare them to replace us
after we've been on the cover of <i>Time</i>.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.406
-Brilliant idea, sir.
-Thanks.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.117
Let's see them try and replace you
with General Dabney Schramm.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.577
-Yeah. Wait, what?

08:14.660 --> 08:17.497
They're considering replacing me
with Schramm? Where did you hear that?

08:17.580 --> 08:19.415
Me? Oh, I didn't hear that.
You heard that.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.334
No, you just… I just heard it from you.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.919
-Me? I heard you say it.
-Yeah! No.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.463
-No, I didn't. You just said it.
-Not me. Oh, I don't think so.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.549
No, you're the…
Okay. All right. All right. Never mind.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.052
See, that's why this photo is important.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.137
We need to exude confidence.

08:33.221 --> 08:36.974
In our faces, we need to say,
"I dare you to replace us."

08:37.058 --> 08:39.602
-That's the look we're going for.
-Yeah. Like this.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.357
Here's the look we're going for.
I got this out of the archives.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.485
Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf.
That look'll burn right through you.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.904
Makes you wanna surrender to him
and give him all your oil.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.697
-Uncle.
-God.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.950
-You all right, sir?
-Yeah, yeah.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.327
I just tweaked my back
exercising this morning.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.245
Oh wow.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.373
Hey. Were you able to make an appointment
with that person I recommended?

09:00.456 --> 09:01.582
Yeah. God!

09:01.666 --> 09:04.377
-Are you okay?
-He… He pulled his back exercising.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.711
Shall I have a look?

09:05.795 --> 09:07.171
No, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.714
-Can you raise your arm?
-Yes.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.550
-Just… Let's see.
-I'm--

09:10.633 --> 09:12.218
-In here?
-Ah! Oh God! Okay.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.302
It's his back.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.389
Just breathe. Breathe.
It's okay. Breathe normally.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.766
-I am breathing.
-No. Let me see.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.851
-No, you know what?

09:20.935 --> 09:23.229
I can't tell if the pain is located here

09:23.312 --> 09:25.690
or if you just do not like being touched,

09:25.773 --> 09:27.525
but it might be a kidney stone.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.943
No, no, no. It's just the back.

09:29.026 --> 09:31.320
Yeah, what did you have
for breakfast this morning?

09:31.404 --> 09:32.321
The usual.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.198
Yeah, uh, I'll need more details.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.491
Uh, steak and eggs.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.702
Sometimes I switch it up
with bacon and eggs.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.413
Okay, well, people who have
a lot of meat in their diet

09:40.496 --> 09:42.707
are susceptible to kidney stones.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.709
Oh, and he eats
corned beef sandwiches for lunch.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.043
Okay, narc.

09:46.127 --> 09:49.046
He didn't ask what I had for lunch.
And he's not a doctor.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.339
Well, I am a doctor.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.216
Well, you're not a <i>doctor</i> doctor.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.595
Yeah, you need a general doctor, General.
A doctor doctor just treats doctors.

09:56.345 --> 09:59.056
Actually, I'm a doctor doctor doctor,

09:59.140 --> 10:01.475
but if you'd rather
just have a second opinion

10:01.559 --> 10:03.436
from a doctor doctor, that's fine.

10:03.519 --> 10:04.437
I'd like to do that.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.522
-Okay. Very well. I will leave.
-Thank you.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.815
Okay. Bye-bye.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.568
Should I make an appointment
with your doctor doctor?

10:10.651 --> 10:11.777
No. And cancel the counselor.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.571
That's eight minutes I'm not getting back.

10:13.654 --> 10:14.905
-All right.
-And you know what?

10:14.989 --> 10:18.868
For lunch, order me a pastrami sandwich
with a big slice of bacon on top.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.745
-That'll show him.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.038
Kidney stones, my--

10:22.121 --> 10:23.581
-Oh boy. It's back.
-Yep.

10:23.664 --> 10:24.915
-Can I help you?
-Mm-mm.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.500
-You sure?
-Yeah, don't touch me.

10:29.378 --> 10:30.296
Hey, Erin.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.590
Hey. I logged that info,

10:32.673 --> 10:35.426
and I cleaned all the gunk
out of the keyboards with a Q-tip.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.345
-Wow!
-Is there anything else you need?

10:37.428 --> 10:41.182
Something important to convince my mom
I should take a gap year?

10:41.932 --> 10:43.392
Can I launch someone somewhere?

10:43.476 --> 10:47.438
No, but we'll do that tomorrow.
We're having this conference call.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.774
We just need you to check all the clocks

10:49.857 --> 10:52.652
to make sure they're all
telling the same time.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.113
Sounds really boring.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.158
-It is.
-But necessary.

10:59.742 --> 11:00.576
Ish.

11:09.919 --> 11:14.382
<i>Hi! Hi, I'm Commander Lancaster</i>
<i>of the Mars mission.</i>

11:14.465 --> 11:15.925
<i>Uh, who… Who are you?</i>

11:16.008 --> 11:17.051
Uh…

11:17.134 --> 11:18.177
I'm Erin.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.012
The intern.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.556
<i>I don't care. That's…</i>
<i> That's wonderful.</i>

11:22.640 --> 11:24.266
<i>I just needed to hear a human voice.</i>

11:25.184 --> 11:26.477
<i>Um…</i>

11:26.560 --> 11:29.814
<i>Please talk to me, Erin.</i>
<i>I'm dying for some human conversation.</i>

11:30.523 --> 11:31.857
What do you wanna talk about?

11:31.941 --> 11:33.818
<i>Anything. Um…</i>

11:34.276 --> 11:36.654
<i> You. Let's talk about you.</i>

11:36.737 --> 11:40.074
Well, uh, my dad's mad at me.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.367
<i>Uh, why?</i>

11:42.493 --> 11:45.496
Because I did some day trading

11:45.579 --> 11:49.458
with stocks online with my college fund.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.127
<i>And you lost it all?</i>

11:51.210 --> 11:52.211
No.

11:52.294 --> 11:56.549
No, uh, I actually made $14,000.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.760
Yeah. But my dad thinks it was too easy.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.431
-Says it was stealing.
-<i>Sounds like he's concerned about you.</i>

12:03.514 --> 12:06.225
I think he's just worried
I'll end up in prison like my mom.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.436
<i>My mom's in jail too. So I can relate.</i>

12:09.019 --> 12:09.895
What did she do?

12:09.979 --> 12:10.813
<i>She…</i>

12:11.981 --> 12:14.859
<i>Sold fake Estée Lauder products.</i>

12:16.736 --> 12:19.405
-You can go to jail for that? Wow. That's…
<i>-What about your mom?</i>

12:20.156 --> 12:21.073
Uh…

12:21.157 --> 12:23.117
It's a little worse than that.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.577
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.</i>

12:24.660 --> 12:28.831
<i>I just wanna say it is a real honor</i>
<i>to finally meet you, Adrian.</i>

12:28.914 --> 12:30.666
<i>Your reputation precedes you.</i>

12:30.750 --> 12:32.626
Well, mostly good, I hope.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.171
Catherine, this is Dr. Chan,

12:35.254 --> 12:38.466
a world-class engineer and my protégé.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.967
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Hi.

12:40.050 --> 12:44.847
<i>Well, we've sent you over some VR goggles</i>
<i>so that you can virtually tour SpaceX.</i>

12:44.930 --> 12:47.683
<i>Of course, you will have to sign</i>
<i>a virtual NDA though.</i>

12:47.767 --> 12:48.851
<i>Just a legal formality.</i>

12:48.934 --> 12:50.227
Oh, yes. Yeah, of course.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.062
-Now?
<i>-Yes, go ahead, please.</i>

12:57.610 --> 13:00.112
And this, I just fit it
over my head, obviously?

13:00.196 --> 13:02.072
Yeah, so that goes in front of your eyes.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.992
Sorry, Catherine. I haven't
done this before, so it's-- Oh boy.

13:05.075 --> 13:05.951
-That's it.
-Oh!

13:06.535 --> 13:07.369
Whoa.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.371
Don't forget
to sign the virtual NDA.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.790
In the air, like this?

13:10.873 --> 13:14.126
-It makes me so dizzy.
-Oh my God. This is awesome.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.253
-Oh boy.
-This place is huge.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.838
Oh, I feel nauseous.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.175
-Sorry, just take a second to adjust.
Oh my God.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.968
Not my generation.

13:23.052 --> 13:26.347
But this… That follows me around where…

13:26.430 --> 13:28.766
This is like a scientist Disneyland.
Look at this place.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.143
Yeah, and my stomach is in my th--

13:31.227 --> 13:33.395
-There's, like, real people here.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.939
Oh, this is amazing.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.191
Jesus. Where did it even go?

13:37.274 --> 13:38.943
-Oh God.
-Where'd it go?

13:39.026 --> 13:40.736
Is this <i>virtual</i> virtual reality?

13:40.820 --> 13:44.114
-There's, like, a waterslide. No way!

13:44.198 --> 13:46.492
Oh, I'm in the cooling system
of a rocket turbine.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.576
I'm not well.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.956
-This is like a roller coaster!
-I have to get some air.

13:52.039 --> 13:55.167
<i>And she only got 20 years for that?</i>

13:55.251 --> 13:57.419
<i>-That's a good lawyer.</i>
Yeah.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.088
<i>Uh, what… what are you drinking?</i>

14:00.214 --> 14:01.924
Oh, it's, uh, grape soda.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.678
<i>Oh, I would kill for some soda.</i>

14:05.761 --> 14:07.471
<i>Anything with some taste.</i>

14:07.555 --> 14:10.724
<i>I am really tired</i>
<i>of drinking my own urine.</i>

14:10.808 --> 14:12.810
-Ugh.
<i>-I mean, it doesn't taste like urine.</i>

14:12.893 --> 14:15.145
<i>It tastes like a, um…</i>

14:15.229 --> 14:18.774
<i>plastic bag that was used to store urine.</i>

14:18.858 --> 14:19.692
That's awful.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.820
<i>Hey, do they still have</i>
<i>those Cheese Nip snacks</i>

14:22.903 --> 14:24.738
<i>in the vending machines there?</i>

14:24.822 --> 14:28.742
<i>'Cause, um, I dream about those sometimes.</i>

14:28.826 --> 14:31.328
I can go check.
I was gonna get a snack anyway.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.331
<i>Oh, would you? That would be great!</i>
<i>That would be so great.</i>

14:34.415 --> 14:37.084
<i>Just seeing real food</i>
<i>would really lift my spirits.</i>

14:37.167 --> 14:39.253
-You got it.
<i>-Yeah. Oh, Erin, Erin, Erin. Wait.</i>

14:39.336 --> 14:40.880
<i>Um, so if you're gonna go out,</i>

14:40.963 --> 14:44.508
<i>could you maybe stop by the, uh,</i>
<i>cafeteria too? Um…</i>

14:44.592 --> 14:48.304
<i>Hilda makes a great</i>
<i>chicken salad sandwich.</i>

14:48.387 --> 14:49.305
Okay.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.181
<i>Oh, and maybe a slice of pizza too.</i>

14:52.099 --> 14:53.767
You know what? I'm gonna write it down.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.437


14:56.520 --> 15:00.691
Hey, guys, meet the new Air Force.
This is his first Joint Chiefs meeting.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.318
-Welcome aboard.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.527
Don't be nervous.

15:03.611 --> 15:07.197
I'm not. You should be
'cause you're on my shit list now.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.618
-Naird's late.
-Probably weeping over his divorce.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.411
That's why I'm never getting married.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.788
-No, it's not.
-Whatever helps you sleep at night.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.789
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

15:15.873 --> 15:18.709
Hey, Naird.
What's happening at Space Force?

15:18.792 --> 15:21.337
Oh, right, nothing,
because they halved your budget.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.840
<i>Well, it's not the size of the budget.</i>
<i>It's the motion of the allocations.</i>

15:24.924 --> 15:27.301
That's what they all say.
I'd rather have a big budget.

15:27.384 --> 15:30.304
<i>Well, didn't keep us</i>
<i>from getting the cover of </i>Time<i> magazine.</i>

15:30.387 --> 15:31.972
<i>-Jealous, Schramm?</i>
You wish.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.226
You okay, Naird?
You look a little paler than usual.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.730
<i>Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>I just tweaked my back exercising.</i>

15:39.813 --> 15:42.316
Yeah, I fucked my back out during sex too.

15:42.399 --> 15:45.027
What's your, uh, coitus protocol, Naird?

15:45.110 --> 15:46.779
Let's talk pelvic action.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.657
Circular, or more on the X-Y axis? Dish.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.867
<i>It… It wasn't intercourse-related.</i>

15:51.951 --> 15:53.452
I never move a muscle during sex.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.497
The sexual motion
is supposed to be woman's work.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.958
-So you're like a corpse in bed?
-It's in the Bible.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.085
<i>-Didn't see that in the Bible.</i>
Keep lookin'.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.170
-Did you try taking ibuprofen?
<i>-Didn't work.</i>

16:03.253 --> 16:04.630
Two words. Bengay.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.465
Look, don't let someone crack your back.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.592
A guy died doing that.
I saw it on <i>60 Minutes</i>.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.135
Or was it his neck?

16:10.219 --> 16:11.261
Bengay.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.221
It was his neck.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.390
I hear hanging upside down
by your feet works,

16:14.473 --> 16:16.016
but not longer than 20 minutes.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.434
-A guy in Florida…
<i>-Died?</i>

16:17.518 --> 16:20.396
No, he passed out and soiled himself.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.814
-Then died.
<i>-Ah, okay.</i>

16:21.897 --> 16:22.856
Bengay.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.733
<i>Do you have stock in Bengay?</i>

16:25.859 --> 16:27.403
It's a good time to buy in.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.406
<i>Okay.</i>

16:30.489 --> 16:32.282
<i>Let's…</i>

16:33.075 --> 16:34.576
<i>open the cola.</i>

16:35.327 --> 16:36.870
<i>Okay. And, oh, Erin, Erin, Erin,</i>

16:36.954 --> 16:39.832
<i>slowly and closer to the microphone</i>

16:40.833 --> 16:42.167
<i>so that I can hear it.</i>

16:42.251 --> 16:43.085
Okay.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.633
<i>Ooh.</i>

16:49.717 --> 16:51.093
<i>I missed that sound.</i>

16:51.176 --> 16:52.344
<i>Oh. Okay.</i>

16:52.428 --> 16:54.221
<i>Take a sip.</i>

16:54.930 --> 16:55.889
<i>Little sip.</i>

16:57.307 --> 16:58.684
<i>Oh. Okay.</i>

16:58.767 --> 17:03.147
<i>Let's kick it up a notch and, uh…</i>
<i>uh, take a bite of the pizza.</i>

17:08.736 --> 17:12.489
<i>Okay, what notes are you catching?</i>

17:12.573 --> 17:14.116
-Notes?
<i>-Flavors.</i>

17:14.199 --> 17:15.034
Mm.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.412
Little bit of cardboard.

17:18.495 --> 17:21.832
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>
-A hint of 1999 Toyota Camry.

17:23.834 --> 17:24.918
And cigarette smoke.

17:29.631 --> 17:30.883
<i>Slice of heaven.</i>

17:30.966 --> 17:32.801
And that's what I'm talking about.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.636
Because, let's be real,

17:34.720 --> 17:38.557
you're all going into real estate
because you want to be somebody.

17:39.349 --> 17:43.270
But I'm here to tell you
that you already are somebody.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.438
Right?

17:44.521 --> 17:48.942
You, sir. What is the most exciting thing
you've ever done in your entire life?

17:49.026 --> 17:50.027
Uh…

17:50.569 --> 17:53.697
I walked-ran a 5K marathon.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.741
-Good for you.

17:55.824 --> 17:56.658
Pretty good.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.203
And I'm here to tell you
that you can go even bigger.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.663
-Just run the whole thing next time.
-Stop.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.501
You, ma'am, what is
the most exciting thing you've done?

18:05.584 --> 18:10.839
Yesterday I tried a papay-yay
for the first time.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.841
-Very exotic. Right?

18:12.925 --> 18:16.970
Yeah, you two. Hi. What is
the most exciting thing you've done?

18:17.054 --> 18:19.181
No, thank you.
I don't have a story I'd like to share,

18:19.264 --> 18:20.390
but great job, everybody.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.476
Oh, that's okay.
You must have done something.

18:23.602 --> 18:24.645
Of course. Come on.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.481
Yeah, uh, okay. Well, I'm an astronaut.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.817
So, um, I went to the moon,

18:29.900 --> 18:32.319
and I walked around
on the surface of the moon.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.320
So, stuff like that.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.740
Okay.

18:36.824 --> 18:37.866
We're not clapping?

18:37.950 --> 18:40.160
If you don't have a story,
you don't have to make one up.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.245
Oh, I didn't make that up.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.413
I know it sounds wild.
But I actually went to the moon.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.290
She's not lying. She's been on the moon.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.877
Not only that, she was
the first-ever Black woman on the moon.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.922
I'm sorry if that's not as riveting
as eating a "pa-pay-yaysh."

18:52.005 --> 18:54.842
I don't think everybody understands
what's going on here. If I may, okay.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.594
This woman right here is a hero.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.931
The most exciting thing everybody
will be talking about in this room

19:01.014 --> 19:05.060
is that they were sitting close
to the woman that was on the moon.

19:05.144 --> 19:05.978
Here we go.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.565
-Yeah. Hero.

19:09.648 --> 19:10.774
Thanks. That was sweet.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.819
Sir, what have you done?

19:13.902 --> 19:18.991
Me? Well, I was voted
hottest media consultant in 2018.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.951
-Nice. All right.
-Thank you.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.870
Seems not as much applause
but that's all right.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.582
I can basically turn anybody in this room
into an influencer in under two weeks.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.709
-I'll take one more round of applause.
-Okay.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.546
No. And that's what you can do
for other people.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.590
What… What have you done?

19:35.215 --> 19:36.049
For you?

19:39.052 --> 19:39.887
Yeah.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.389
I once jumped off my roof
into my neighbor's pool.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.099
-Good for you!

19:44.183 --> 19:45.934
And that's bigger than you think.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.064
-All three of them?
-Of course.

19:51.148 --> 19:55.152
Let's have you hold that.
Put those on. And great.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.487
Great.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.781
I'm not holding this.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.784
-Oh. You're a scientist, aren't you?
-Yes, but I'm not a Muppet.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.203
The other guy said he'd do it.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.288
He is a Muppet.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.498
Is Naird here? Where is he?

20:08.582 --> 20:10.709
Oh my God.
I've lost the commanding officer.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.629
Brad, calm down.
Where did you last see him?

20:13.712 --> 20:15.380
Well, I was walking on his back,

20:15.464 --> 20:17.257
he got mad, then he went to the restroom,

20:17.341 --> 20:18.550
but he's not there.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.556
Mark? Is that you?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.268
Mark, are you okay? Where are you?

20:28.352 --> 20:29.228
<i> I'm…</i>

20:29.311 --> 20:32.147
<i> Ah… Eee… Ay… Eee.</i>

20:32.231 --> 20:34.441
It sounded like he said Hawaii.

20:34.524 --> 20:37.152
He's in Hawaii. You earned it, sir.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.947
Mark, just stay where you are.
We'll come and find you.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.823
Go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.663
Kidney stone?
How did I get a kidney stone?

20:47.746 --> 20:50.666
Could be bad diet,
but most are stress-related.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.960
Well, it's not stress.
I eat stress for breakfast.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.838
Yeah, along with huge portions of meat.
He's also going through a divorce.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.382
It has nothing to do with that.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.592
Mark, if you weren't wound so tight,

21:00.676 --> 21:03.178
there wouldn't be
a boulder in your ureter.

21:03.262 --> 21:07.975
Okay, Doc, so what's the story?
What do I do from here?

21:08.058 --> 21:11.687
Well, normally, you would just drink
plenty of fluids and then pass the stone.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.481
But, in your case,
the stone is unusually big.

21:14.564 --> 21:17.985
We need to do a ureteroscopy,
which can be extremely painful.

21:18.068 --> 21:18.902
Ooh. Okay.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.071
I highly recommend a shot of morphine.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.031
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not doing morphine.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.950
Take the morphine, Mark.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.868
No, morphine is for babies.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.705
I'll take some of that "nirvana nectar."

21:30.831 --> 21:33.542
<i>I can't… I can't hear the leaves rustling.</i>

21:33.625 --> 21:35.877
Well, I'm trying, okay? I'm not the wind.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.213
<i>Oh God. I miss trees.</i>

21:38.297 --> 21:40.090
Can I please stop? My arms are tired.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.591
<i>Okay, yes. All right. Yes.</i>

21:41.675 --> 21:44.094
<i>Thank… Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you for indulging me.</i>

21:44.177 --> 21:46.888
<i>Uh, I… I don't feel like, uh,</i>
<i>killing myself anymore.</i>

21:46.972 --> 21:49.474
<i>And it's all thanks to you, Erin.</i>

21:52.769 --> 21:55.188
But you were thinking of doing that?

21:56.690 --> 21:57.816
<i>Not anymore.</i>

21:59.359 --> 22:02.487
<i>But I'll tell you something.</i>
<i>You matter, Erin.</i>

22:03.071 --> 22:05.490
<i>The Earth matters.</i>

22:05.574 --> 22:08.535
<i>Find time to hug a tree,</i>

22:08.618 --> 22:10.662
<i>dip a toe into a lake.</i>

22:10.746 --> 22:11.747
<i>Will you promise?</i>

22:13.457 --> 22:14.499
Okay.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.044
<i>I guess I should get back to work.</i>

22:17.127 --> 22:17.961
<i>Oh, Erin? Erin?</i>

22:20.964 --> 22:23.633
<i>I'll tell you something.</i>

22:25.927 --> 22:26.803
<i>Uh…</i>

22:27.763 --> 22:28.847
<i>Up here,</i>

22:30.307 --> 22:32.642
<i>tears float.</i>

22:34.311 --> 22:35.604
<i>Like little globes.</i>

22:36.438 --> 22:39.107
<i>The same salinity as the sea.</i>

22:41.777 --> 22:43.028
<i>I miss you, Earth.</i>

22:48.075 --> 22:50.827
<i>I should go catch that tear</i>

22:50.911 --> 22:54.164
<i>before it shorts out the life support,</i>
<i>and I asphyxiate.</i>

22:54.706 --> 22:56.041
<i>Uh… Bye!</i>

22:59.669 --> 23:01.755
-Looking for the ureter.

23:01.838 --> 23:02.756
-There it is.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.509
-Up we go.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.095
Oh wow.
That's the general's urinary track?

23:08.178 --> 23:11.264
Tract, yes, and please refrain
from touching the monitor

23:11.348 --> 23:13.100
with your greasy fingers.

23:13.183 --> 23:14.559
Ah! I wanna see it.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.687
Brad, AirPlay the screen
from your phone to mine.

23:17.771 --> 23:18.647
Okay.

23:19.689 --> 23:20.524
Did it work?

23:20.607 --> 23:22.150
Mm-mm.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.278
No. It's not coming through.
Where are you sending this, Brad?

23:25.362 --> 23:27.823
-<i>Oh! Come on, man!</i>
-What is that?

23:27.906 --> 23:31.243
It sounds like your father screaming.
Is that what I think it is?

23:31.326 --> 23:33.870
That's a kidney stone
making its way through the urinary tract.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.164
-Oh…

23:37.958 --> 23:40.293
Come on, man. It's not there.

23:40.377 --> 23:41.586
I'm seeing it fine.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.171
-I can't watch.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.966
I can't watch.
That's every guy's worst nightmare.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.759
Mm! Hm! Ooh-hoo!

23:47.843 --> 23:48.760
What's happening?

23:48.844 --> 23:51.388
-Whoa. Oh my gosh.
-Adrian, hold my hand!

23:52.556 --> 23:54.558
-It's almost through!
Okay, come on, Dad!

23:54.641 --> 23:55.475
So close.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.227
-It's coming out.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.438
-Ah! Oh!
-Whoo!

23:59.563 --> 24:01.898
-Oh my God.
-Oh, I'm so relieved.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.567
-Oh, fu…
-You all right?

24:03.650 --> 24:05.444
-<i>Can I see it?</i>
-Hello?

24:05.527 --> 24:08.405
<i>Dr. Chan. It's Catherine from SpaceX.</i>

24:08.488 --> 24:10.449
<i>We'd love for you to join the team.</i>

24:10.532 --> 24:11.450
Really?

24:12.033 --> 24:14.453
That's great!
Uh, did you call Dr. Mallory?

24:15.078 --> 24:18.623
<i>Uh, no, we're just offering the job</i>
<i>to you, not Dr. Mallory.</i>

24:18.707 --> 24:22.252
<i>We felt your energy</i>
<i>is a better culture fit for our office.</i>

24:23.211 --> 24:24.129
Oh.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.715
Okay. Um…

24:28.300 --> 24:29.926
-Can I call you back?
<i>-Yes.</i>

24:33.889 --> 24:35.682
Oh shit.

24:38.059 --> 24:41.480
All right, let's go take that photo.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.736
My back-row buddy.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.865
All right, everybody
looking sharp, straight down the lens.

24:51.948 --> 24:54.201
Thinking about our favorite constellation.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.953
On three. One, two, three.
