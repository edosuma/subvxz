01:55.748 --> 01:59.115
<i>- You speak the language?
- Better than most of the people in here.</i>

01:59.185 --> 02:02.450
The locals all said
you were the go-to guy on this.

02:04.524 --> 02:07.687
- You work with a regular team?
- Just the redneck.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.598
Tell me about this area.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.197
Hundred and fifty Ks northwest of here.

02:17.270 --> 02:20.706
Every couple of months it switches
between government and insurgency hands.

02:20.773 --> 02:22.206
My advice, don't go there.

02:24.010 --> 02:25.341
<i>I have to.</i>

02:42.595 --> 02:45.621
<i>When the war is over,
this place will be a free market.</i>

02:45.698 --> 02:48.132
<i>- It's mineral rich.
- Are you some kind of geologist?</i>

02:48.201 --> 02:49.634
<i>An engineer.</i>

02:50.236 --> 02:53.637
I'm on a retainer to a company
that acquired some real estate here.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.765
I go in, survey it. You ensure my safety.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.037
- I'll operate a six-man fire team.
- How much?

02:58.111 --> 03:01.410
- Six thousand US per man, cash.
- Four.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.779
Payable only on my safe return.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.680
- You've worked with mercenaries before.
- Where the guidebooks recommend.

03:07.754 --> 03:10.689
But where you've been
has nothing to do with where you are.

03:10.757 --> 03:11.883
Five.

03:13.793 --> 03:16.785
Equipment will run to another five, up front.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.234
Be here tomorrow night.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.365
I'll have a squad by then.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.744
Fucking ride, eh?

03:38.818 --> 03:42.879
This big fancy company
can't pay for a bird, huh?

03:42.956 --> 03:45.823
And let those RPGs blow us out the sky

03:45.892 --> 03:48.759
like the Red Cross
a couple of months back?

03:48.828 --> 03:50.420
Smart moves.

03:50.496 --> 03:52.794
How am I supposed to work with this shit?

03:52.865 --> 03:54.526
So don't get hit.

03:58.504 --> 04:00.870
So what do you think this place is?

04:00.940 --> 04:03.909
- Fucked if I know. Same if I care.
- Right.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.639
Man pays the money, he picks the tune.

04:06.713 --> 04:11.650
<i>He's kurac, anyway.
There's nothing built out here for sure.</i>

04:11.718 --> 04:12.844
Yeah, whatever.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.649
Take a good look at secrets man up here.

04:18.558 --> 04:22.289
Now, why does a prick like that
hire seven swords in a bar?

04:23.129 --> 04:26.257
For the same reason he doesn't go
with private security, either.

04:26.332 --> 04:27.799
Secrets, man.

04:33.473 --> 04:36.499
So what is real story, huh, Top?

05:23.456 --> 05:25.083
Yeah, this is it.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.420
- What do you think?
- Think we're gonna get wet.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.203
All right, roll it out.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.036
There's a lot of traffic.

05:43.109 --> 05:46.442
Regular Army has positions to the south.
Insurgents to the north.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.106
UN safe area is southwest.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.514
Right, lads, places to be.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.927
Jesus Christ!

07:31.584 --> 07:32.744
Why have we gone dark?

07:32.819 --> 07:36.084
'Cause this thing was built
before they invented fucking trees.

07:36.155 --> 07:38.385
Well, we're not going anywhere
with it down,

07:38.458 --> 07:40.016
so get it done.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.188
Fifty says that company of his
lost some new flyer out here.

07:45.264 --> 07:46.822
Serious?

07:46.899 --> 07:49.060
- An airplane?
- Sure.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.797
Some high-tech shit on board, too.

07:51.871 --> 07:54.738
Got to test those bad boys
in live conditions, man.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.709
And what, you a CIA operator?

07:59.579 --> 08:00.978
No.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.878
But 100 says he could be.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.295
Well, it's not a plane.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.434
Cotter, give me a base of fire from here
in case we have to double-time it back out.

09:04.510 --> 09:07.070
The rest of you give me a perimeter.

09:30.536 --> 09:31.969
<i>Four, okay.</i>

09:32.038 --> 09:33.562
Five, good.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.907
<i>- One, okay.
- Six, okay.</i>

09:39.045 --> 09:40.535
<i>Two, all good.</i>

09:41.380 --> 09:43.541
He's underground, huh?

09:43.616 --> 09:45.140
<i>You'd be smart
if you weren't so fucking stupid,</i>

09:45.217 --> 09:46.878
<i>do you know that?</i>

09:49.956 --> 09:51.583
You're with him.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.286
Okay, everyone on me.

10:48.447 --> 10:49.573
Hunt.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.247
- This is it?
- Yeah.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.348
Minerals, huh? Right.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.689
Cotter, Tak, doors.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.833
Jordan and Tak, hold. Everyone else on me.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.588
Down here.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.959
Right. Hunt, on me.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.362
Prior, Voyteche, left.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.263
Cotter, McKay, right.

12:50.736 --> 12:51.930
Clear.

13:48.828 --> 13:53.322
What the fucking hell does a guy like him
want with a shithole like this?

13:54.233 --> 13:57.031
- What?
- Quarter right. On the tree line.

14:00.606 --> 14:01.903
How many?

14:02.875 --> 14:04.638
<i>In the tree line!</i>

14:05.511 --> 14:06.876
You, stay.

14:08.714 --> 14:10.181
Rounds received?

14:10.249 --> 14:12.114
- Come on. Rounds received.
- None.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.310
What?

14:14.386 --> 14:16.946
Someone confirm me a fucking target!

14:20.993 --> 14:22.551
Cease fire.

14:22.628 --> 14:24.391
Mac, shut that off.

14:26.131 --> 14:27.428
Man down!

14:32.404 --> 14:34.702
Jordan, get the fuck over here!

14:42.381 --> 14:46.249
- Cease fire, everyone, cease fire.
- Cease fire. We're fucking bleeding here!

14:46.318 --> 14:50.880
- Shut the fuck up! Mac!
- I said cease fucking firing! Tak!

14:55.461 --> 14:57.691
Hey! Take it easy.

14:58.998 --> 15:02.456
- Where's the shooter?
- Right. 60 meters. I don't know!

15:10.576 --> 15:12.976
See? I got him.

15:13.045 --> 15:14.706
Lucky if you hit that tree out there.

15:16.782 --> 15:20.513
That's one nervous little bitch finger
you got on your trigger there, teardrop.

15:20.586 --> 15:24.022
When I say, "Hold fire," you hold fire.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.221
I got him.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.289
You sure of that?
Fine. Sweep and clean that area.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.301
- Oh, fuck, Sputnik, I'll do it.
- No!

15:41.573 --> 15:42.801
I do it.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.905
The rest of you, cover him.

16:37.796 --> 16:40.731
- It's nothing.
- Bodies? Blood?

16:40.799 --> 16:42.733
Not even shell casings.

16:48.073 --> 16:49.472
Are we good?

16:51.243 --> 16:52.301
Yeah.

16:52.378 --> 16:56.314
It was probably some passing patrol
or someone out for a jolly.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.873
But this place is a tactical nightmare.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.942
I've got an elevated tree line
bordering open ground,

17:01.020 --> 17:02.885
and I need to deal with that.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.819
How long will it take?

17:05.391 --> 17:08.416
I need any available power on-line
down here, in case we have to hole up.

17:08.493 --> 17:10.587
Can you help me with that? Right.

17:12.196 --> 17:15.928
Voyteche, Tak, hold here
until we square it away down below.

17:16.969 --> 17:21.838
- We're gonna be bottled up down there.
- Beats getting ventilated up here.

17:21.906 --> 17:25.205
Jordan, Mac, need you mobile.

17:25.277 --> 17:27.507
I need a fortnight in Tijuana.

17:38.991 --> 17:42.358
You know, what you're doing here
is your business, and I respect that.

17:42.428 --> 17:43.952
But when we start taking fire,

17:44.029 --> 17:47.260
your business
can quickly become my business.

17:47.332 --> 17:50.199
Could there be others, like you, out here?

17:50.269 --> 17:52.601
No, there's no one else looking.

18:00.479 --> 18:02.913
Why so sure?

18:02.981 --> 18:05.916
My backers are wealthy enough
to ensure silence.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.451
From anybody.

18:25.170 --> 18:28.298
War has been played out around here
for years.

18:28.373 --> 18:30.773
Anybody could have stumbled across it.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.969
That entry was easy enough.

18:33.946 --> 18:38.383
Sure, the odd patrol could have come
down here from time to time, maybe.

18:39.518 --> 18:41.884
But they don't know what to look for.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.615
And that would be?

18:46.692 --> 18:48.159
Minerals?

18:48.227 --> 18:52.493
Who does he think he's kidding?
This place is wrong, very wrong.

19:40.546 --> 19:43.515
Is it just me, or does that not belong here?

20:11.843 --> 20:13.174
Generator.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.652
- Can you get it going?
- Let's see.

21:20.912 --> 21:23.540
What the fuck is this guy looking for?

21:51.743 --> 21:53.210
What is that?

21:58.517 --> 22:00.644
Motherfuck!

22:04.523 --> 22:05.615
Fuck!

22:15.701 --> 22:17.635
- I think we're good if...
- Medic!

22:17.703 --> 22:19.398
- Jordan!
- Stay here.

22:19.471 --> 22:20.699
Jordan!

22:21.139 --> 22:22.299
Clear.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.074
Over here.

22:26.144 --> 22:28.806
Principal's back that way,
keep an eye on him. Jordan.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.871
We need a fucking medic!

22:31.817 --> 22:32.977
Medic!

22:34.486 --> 22:35.544
Jordan!

22:35.620 --> 22:38.384
We've got a fucking breather down there!

22:42.060 --> 22:43.220
Jesus!

22:44.596 --> 22:47.360
Don't just fucking stand there! Help me!

22:49.668 --> 22:52.159
- Shit!
- Jesus fuck!

22:52.237 --> 22:53.669
Look at him.

23:56.535 --> 23:57.661
Name?

23:58.837 --> 24:00.566
Poor bastard.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.334
His brain is totally minced.

24:02.407 --> 24:03.533
Name?

24:05.677 --> 24:06.974
Back off!

24:09.014 --> 24:12.245
He's fucking gone, guys. Pluto.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.182
I'm shot.
What part of me looks like I give a fuck?

24:14.252 --> 24:16.277
Wait a sec.
He could just be a fucking farmer.

24:16.354 --> 24:18.686
Farmer? Yeah, right.

24:18.757 --> 24:21.089
- Talk, fuckmeat!
- That's enough.

24:24.930 --> 24:28.457
Top, I reckon the locals used this place
for a little bit of ethnic cleansing

24:28.533 --> 24:30.763
- then moved on.
- It's possible.

24:34.206 --> 24:37.004
It's like a slaughterhouse down there.

24:37.075 --> 24:40.306
- He's the only one we found breathing.
- Christ.

24:40.378 --> 24:42.073
Your guess is as good as mine.

24:42.147 --> 24:45.674
So what does that make you?
Some kind of fucking tourist?

24:45.750 --> 24:47.718
- I could ask you the same.
- I'm a soldier.

24:47.786 --> 24:49.185
No, you're an employee.

24:49.254 --> 24:51.518
Speaking of which, aren't you supposed
to be protecting someone?

24:51.590 --> 24:52.887
How do you think I got that?

24:52.958 --> 24:55.722
- And how does beating him up help?
- It made me feel better, all right?

24:55.794 --> 24:58.024
Running a little low on causes, though,
wouldn't you say?

24:58.096 --> 24:59.427
Walk away.

25:07.739 --> 25:11.072
You know, getting punchy
isn't the smartest play with these guys.

25:11.142 --> 25:14.202
Which is why I hired you to hold their leash.

25:14.279 --> 25:16.577
You seem pretty concerned for his welfare.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.707
It's just a little thing called compassion.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.944
- So he's nothing to do with you?
- Nothing.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.919
And finding all those dead bodies
and him in the middle

25:22.988 --> 25:26.424
has got nothing to do
with your assignment?

25:26.491 --> 25:29.483
I don't think he looked like
he was in my line of business, do you?

25:29.561 --> 25:32.689
Now, am I dismissed?

25:32.797 --> 25:36.563
That being the case,
I think you might all want to see this.

25:41.940 --> 25:45.808
You can say what you like about the Nazis,
but they had style.

25:46.344 --> 25:49.245
What the fuck are we doing
standing in a German bunker?

25:49.314 --> 25:50.372
SS.

25:51.349 --> 25:55.149
- But not since about 1945.
- Aye, right.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.449
Wait a minute.

25:58.523 --> 26:00.991
You're looking for gold out here, right?

26:01.059 --> 26:03.027
I know about all this shit.

26:03.094 --> 26:04.652
Lost Nazi gold.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.871
Right. Fuck gold.

26:13.939 --> 26:16.567
I want three primaries up there
in the tree line, 30 meters spread

26:16.641 --> 26:19.940
- and lay some wire beyond that.
- Whoa, stop the fucking bus.

26:20.011 --> 26:22.138
I thought this was strictly a 48, in and out.

26:22.213 --> 26:24.704
And now we've got an unknown number
of hostiles sending down fire.

26:24.783 --> 26:26.876
So we, meaning you, dig in.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.125
Bodies.

26:40.198 --> 26:41.961
Dead men this high.

26:45.303 --> 26:47.396
Why dump them here?

26:47.472 --> 26:50.407
Because they more than just killed
these men.

26:53.078 --> 26:55.672
Burying someone already, eh?

26:55.747 --> 26:57.510
Set in for the night.

26:57.582 --> 27:01.348
- Mr. Cunt thinks he's onto some Nazi gold.
- Gold?

27:01.419 --> 27:04.411
Those bushwhackers out there
think they're following a money train.

27:04.489 --> 27:06.855
They'll be back.

27:06.925 --> 27:09.758
So you better watch your arses. All right?

27:11.496 --> 27:13.726
Forty-eight hour job.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.993
You have better places to be?

27:45.797 --> 27:46.889
Nice.

28:22.233 --> 28:23.495
You play?

31:12.237 --> 31:14.967
All this shit is why I left the Marines.

31:15.039 --> 31:18.873
- Strike gold yet?
- Can't even find a match to strike. You got?

31:18.943 --> 31:20.035
Sure.

31:22.313 --> 31:25.248
I hate that feeling you get in the field.

31:25.316 --> 31:28.217
You know, always like
someone is watching you.

31:28.286 --> 31:32.017
Apparently someone is.
Didn't take you for a religious girl.

31:33.124 --> 31:34.216
Yeah.

31:35.793 --> 31:37.784
My old boy was a priest.

31:38.930 --> 31:41.490
Said it was just like being a soldier.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.194
Both do a lot of things on faith.

31:44.269 --> 31:45.395
Yeah.

31:46.204 --> 31:48.536
We both get to burn twice, too.

31:48.606 --> 31:50.733
Once here, then in Hell.

31:55.813 --> 31:59.544
Why don't you police up any med supplies
we got downstairs?

32:03.321 --> 32:05.721
Any time now is just fine, nurse.

32:10.061 --> 32:11.255
Go on.

32:22.573 --> 32:24.473
Your move, by the way.

32:50.301 --> 32:51.427
Nice.

32:52.603 --> 32:56.266
You're gonna have me
in trouble pretty quick by this rate.

33:20.598 --> 33:25.035
Bet you'd talk to her if she bent down
and touched her toes, eh, big lad?

34:08.246 --> 34:09.577
Checkmate?

34:12.050 --> 34:14.712
Just slipped on some loose gold, eh?

34:17.755 --> 34:20.188
- How is our comm situation?
- Not good, Tops.

34:20.257 --> 34:22.726
Not since you ripped
the battery out backwards.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.991
There's a radio room back there
you can cut into. Detail Prior on him

34:26.063 --> 34:29.329
and see if you can scare us up enough
to get back online.

34:29.400 --> 34:33.393
Whoever shot you is still out there
and I don't want to be deaf.

35:56.754 --> 35:58.745
Your men need to grow up.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.821
That's a nine mil hollow-point.

36:30.888 --> 36:32.879
Now, a shell like this
is gonna push your lungs

36:32.957 --> 36:35.152
clean through your spine.

36:35.226 --> 36:38.286
Leave an exit wound big enough
to jump through.

36:47.605 --> 36:50.403
You're gonna talk sooner or later, Gunst.

36:50.908 --> 36:52.876
And it's gonna be to me.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.574
So, this is what all the fuss is about?

36:58.316 --> 36:59.681
What is it?

37:01.586 --> 37:04.146
- The last 18 years of my life.
- This?

37:04.222 --> 37:06.747
It may not look like much right now,

37:08.025 --> 37:11.256
but this could be the Holy Grail of physics.

37:11.329 --> 37:13.661
I never really trusted science.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.757
Well,

37:16.834 --> 37:19.894
there are four forces that control matter.

37:19.971 --> 37:23.737
The key has been trying to find
how those forces interact.

37:23.808 --> 37:26.402
If we can do that,
then we can explain the behavior

37:26.477 --> 37:28.672
of all the substance in the universe.

37:28.746 --> 37:32.443
Einstein coined a phrase,
unified field theory.

37:32.516 --> 37:36.316
Many people thought he was close
to finding a solution.

37:36.387 --> 37:38.719
But when he saw the atomic bomb tests
at Trinity,

37:38.789 --> 37:41.986
he abandoned the research
and destroyed his notes.

37:43.361 --> 37:45.761
Nobody has even come close
to finding a solution since.

37:45.830 --> 37:48.458
So you came all the way out here
because you think that the Nazis...

37:48.532 --> 37:50.864
Were working on the same thing.

37:52.903 --> 37:56.896
I think this machine was designed
to manipulate a unified field.

37:57.908 --> 38:01.071
And that chamber above it
where you found the bodies,

38:01.145 --> 38:04.581
was built to control the resultant energy,
contain it.

38:06.050 --> 38:09.213
- Why?
- The Germans were trying to win a war.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.847
But with this technology,

38:11.922 --> 38:15.380
its application and impact
in the modern world would be

38:16.594 --> 38:17.959
limitless.

38:19.430 --> 38:21.364
And probably priceless.

39:02.573 --> 39:04.700
Mr. Hunt, is that you, sir?

39:43.814 --> 39:45.111
You okay?

40:10.107 --> 40:13.565
What's the matter?
You look like I fucked your sister.

40:17.481 --> 40:19.608
You ain't gonna get an answer, you know.

40:19.683 --> 40:20.911
Shut up!

40:23.988 --> 40:26.752
Killed a man once, asked for two things.

40:27.858 --> 40:30.418
When he was done crying for his mama,
he begged for his God.

40:30.494 --> 40:32.928
And you know what the answer was?

40:34.565 --> 40:35.827
A bullet.

40:36.534 --> 40:37.728
See...

40:39.236 --> 40:41.067
That bright light...

40:41.939 --> 40:43.736
It ain't Heaven, son.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.633
It's just a muzzle flare.

42:03.687 --> 42:04.779
Hey.

42:05.956 --> 42:07.184
Listen.

42:32.049 --> 42:33.880
Fucking love culture.

42:39.456 --> 42:41.651
Mac, turn that shit off!

43:23.400 --> 43:24.662
Incoming!

43:45.089 --> 43:46.556
Contact!

44:10.714 --> 44:12.773
- How many?
- Fuck knows!

44:14.885 --> 44:16.546
You, hold fast.

44:22.326 --> 44:24.851
Stay down. Pick your targets.

44:27.431 --> 44:30.662
Mac, quarter left. Cotter, quarter right.

44:50.654 --> 44:51.814
Jesus!

44:57.628 --> 44:59.493
God damn it!

45:52.716 --> 45:54.650
Sound off.

45:54.718 --> 45:56.345
- One, okay.
- Two, okay.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.354
- Three, okay.
- Four, okay.

45:59.857 --> 46:01.688
- Six, okay.
- Seven, okay.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.493
Five. Sound off. Five?

46:06.463 --> 46:08.988
- He's gone.
- What the...

46:09.066 --> 46:11.534
- Tak? Taktarov?
- No, stay down.

46:11.602 --> 46:14.696
Voyteche. What happened?

46:14.772 --> 46:17.138
- I don't know. The wind...
- Tak!

46:18.509 --> 46:21.273
- Where the fuck is he?
- Maybe he done a runner down the bunker.

46:21.345 --> 46:23.472
- Maybe they took him.
- Tak!

46:23.547 --> 46:25.606
How close did they get in?

46:26.717 --> 46:28.844
Prior, check the perimeter.

46:30.954 --> 46:32.945
No way they got that close.
Too much open ground.

46:33.023 --> 46:36.220
What, the wind and light show
didn't distract you?

46:40.030 --> 46:42.828
Wire ain't touched.
The Claymores are intact.

46:42.900 --> 46:46.199
- They didn't even get close.
- So he ran.

46:46.270 --> 46:47.328
No.

46:48.539 --> 46:50.063
He didn't run.

46:51.041 --> 46:54.033
Fuckers must really want
a piece of that gold.

46:56.146 --> 46:57.773
There is no gold.

47:03.220 --> 47:05.051
All right, hold fast.

47:07.491 --> 47:09.118
- Top?
- Later, Jordan.

47:09.193 --> 47:10.319
Sir.

47:12.696 --> 47:14.664
I've been holding this.

47:14.731 --> 47:17.393
The round I dug out of Mac's arm.

47:17.467 --> 47:19.526
An old 7.62, huh?

47:20.537 --> 47:23.028
Yeah, except look at it.

47:23.106 --> 47:26.701
There's no way it could have been fired,
it's totally wasted.

47:26.777 --> 47:28.267
You sure?

47:28.345 --> 47:32.076
Trust me, that could never have
cleared a barrel's end.

47:32.149 --> 47:36.381
This, Tak, that cross, and before...

47:38.355 --> 47:40.380
Jesus, 18 hours ago this was an easy ride.

47:40.457 --> 47:42.322
Aye, and 36 hours ago
you could handle anything.

47:42.392 --> 47:44.587
Now wind your bloody neck in!

47:46.163 --> 47:47.255
Sir.

48:17.027 --> 48:18.756
Fuck with me.

48:18.829 --> 48:20.057
Please.

48:37.681 --> 48:39.308
- Which one?
- Tak.

48:40.484 --> 48:42.452
Whoever took him left that.

48:42.519 --> 48:46.285
This was a Nazi bunker, DC.
There are plenty of relics here.

48:47.724 --> 48:49.715
See where that's decayed?

48:49.793 --> 48:53.422
That should have killed the man firing it.
Instead we pulled it out of Mac's arm.

48:53.497 --> 48:55.829
Your team can function
with a man down, right?

48:55.899 --> 48:58.493
Oh, sure. Maybe you'd like to shoulder arms

48:58.568 --> 49:00.160
and come and sample the fucked up
weather and light show

49:00.237 --> 49:01.670
we've been having as well, eh?

49:01.738 --> 49:05.071
- Weather and lights?
- Yeah, fireworks and a wind.

49:06.143 --> 49:09.476
Well, like nothing
I've ever experienced before.

49:09.546 --> 49:11.980
Things happen in the field, but...

49:12.916 --> 49:13.974
Ludicrous.

49:14.051 --> 49:17.714
Well, trust me, after what I've just seen,
nothing is ludicrous.

49:19.790 --> 49:22.190
Maybe he took it himself.

49:22.259 --> 49:25.660
Or whoever took him left it.

49:25.729 --> 49:28.425
Right. So whoever they are,
wear the Iron Cross

49:28.498 --> 49:30.363
and are fucking invisible to you, eh?

49:30.434 --> 49:33.369
Mac, think about it. Behind the wire.

49:33.437 --> 49:37.032
Oh, come on, you've seen that complex.
They could be right beneath us.

49:37.107 --> 49:39.007
- We cleared it.
- Did we?

49:40.911 --> 49:42.503
We're in charge.

49:59.763 --> 50:03.426
The Third Reich was renowned
for dabbling with the occult.

50:05.002 --> 50:07.903
Fantasy blending with scientific research.

50:10.640 --> 50:14.041
Field theory would have been
perfect for them.

50:14.111 --> 50:16.978
An equation
that could bend space and time.

50:18.415 --> 50:20.440
Potentially alter reality.

50:25.322 --> 50:28.849
They were running some kind of trials
on these soldiers.

50:32.462 --> 50:35.829
Exposing them to the energy
harnessed in that chamber above.

50:35.899 --> 50:36.957
Why?

50:39.536 --> 50:43.666
Honestly, I think they were trying
to enhance the men.

50:43.740 --> 50:45.799
Enhance them?

50:45.876 --> 50:50.142
Theoretically, the human body
could become fused, disappear.

50:51.681 --> 50:54.775
Interwoven with
the magnetic fields themselves.

50:55.619 --> 50:58.554
The Americans tried something similar
in '43.

50:59.389 --> 51:04.452
<i>An attempt was made to render a warship,
the USS Eldridge, invisible,</i>

51:04.528 --> 51:06.496
using Einstein's theories.

51:06.563 --> 51:09.054
The Philadelphia Experiment.

51:09.132 --> 51:12.363
Urban myth has it
they were partially successful.

51:12.436 --> 51:15.769
I think the Nazis were attempting
something similar.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.100
Maybe even more ambitious.

51:25.182 --> 51:29.278
A soldier that was invulnerable,
unstoppable.

51:29.352 --> 51:31.081
You're not serious?

51:32.389 --> 51:33.754
They were.

52:19.336 --> 52:22.271
An Army that could travel
thousands of miles,

52:23.306 --> 52:25.206
and nobody would be any the wiser

52:25.275 --> 52:28.733
until it materialized at the gates
of the White House.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.971
Well, that's great.

52:32.048 --> 52:34.846
But as far as I remember,
the Germans lost the war.

52:34.918 --> 52:38.820
And I don't think we're fighting
a bunch of pensioners, do you?

52:39.823 --> 52:43.554
In theory, the men could still be
trapped within the fields.

52:45.195 --> 52:49.359
They would only resurface
when the fields are disrupted, like, by us.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.135
In English.

52:52.202 --> 52:55.797
All existence is nothing more than vibration.

52:55.872 --> 52:59.137
For years, those who believe
have claimed that

53:00.510 --> 53:05.106
apparitions are merely ripples
in electro-magnetic fields.

53:05.182 --> 53:09.642
- Echoes of a previous vibration.
- Apparitions, you mean ghosts?

53:09.719 --> 53:13.314
You need help, really. Fucking ghosts?

53:13.390 --> 53:15.483
Ten minutes ago you were
talking about magic bullets

53:15.559 --> 53:18.494
and men who vanished into thin air.

53:18.562 --> 53:20.621
So, fuck your Nobel Prize!

53:20.697 --> 53:23.165
I'm pulling the plug right now.
Start packing.

53:23.233 --> 53:25.326
- You can't do that.
- Oh, you watch me.

53:25.402 --> 53:27.962
No, you really can't do that.

53:32.409 --> 53:36.038
Sometimes it's not the bullets that kill you.

53:36.112 --> 53:37.739
It's the orders.

53:39.783 --> 53:42.877
I was surprised some of your men
had loved ones.

53:46.823 --> 53:48.586
You ran us through.

53:49.993 --> 53:53.520
There was no exaggeration
in what I said before.

53:53.597 --> 53:56.566
This machine could be worth billions.

53:56.633 --> 53:59.158
The backers have assets in Interpol.

54:01.805 --> 54:05.764
They'll go after the families first,
yours and mine!

54:09.713 --> 54:11.738
I've told the financiers.

54:13.049 --> 54:16.143
- Another team's been dispatched.
- How long?

54:16.219 --> 54:18.744
They're moving as fast as they can.

54:32.836 --> 54:36.237
Please, I have a little child.

54:43.613 --> 54:45.376
Fucking hell are they doing to him?

55:33.296 --> 55:36.094
They're playing with some black dice now.

56:04.794 --> 56:08.753
They say you can feel them.
The bad ones, you know?

56:08.832 --> 56:11.164
How you know that?

56:11.234 --> 56:14.670
- Been talking to the dead?
- I've seen some things, I'll tell you that.

56:14.738 --> 56:18.333
But this, this shit is just fucking weird, eh?

56:18.408 --> 56:20.535
I wouldn't know.

56:20.610 --> 56:23.044
Never lived another way.

56:23.113 --> 56:27.243
Yeah? Well, where I come from,
a lad doesn't join the British Army.

56:28.351 --> 56:30.251
Not a good son, anyway.

56:32.288 --> 56:35.257
I held my first AK-47 when I was five.

56:36.493 --> 56:38.518
Fired it at nine.

56:38.595 --> 56:42.622
I make my first clean kill when I was 15.

56:45.201 --> 56:46.828
Families forgive.

56:48.171 --> 56:50.696
But one thing I know,

56:50.774 --> 56:54.175
there's no motherfucker care less
about us right now.

59:09.412 --> 59:10.811
Fuck!

59:26.796 --> 59:27.956
No way.

59:28.031 --> 59:30.522
No fucking way did someone
get past us to do this.

59:30.600 --> 59:33.194
- He's right. Wire is intact.
- Because they did it.

59:33.269 --> 59:35.464
- Who the fuck are "they"?
- Oh, come on Mac.

59:35.538 --> 59:38.632
- You've seen something, I know you have.
- No such thing.

59:38.708 --> 59:40.437
No such what?

59:40.510 --> 59:43.138
- They put an empty in Tak's fucking skull!
- Jordan.

59:43.212 --> 59:45.271
To fuck with reason!

59:45.348 --> 59:48.146
These are no ordinary guys. Think!

59:48.217 --> 59:51.277
- That Nazi shit. The bullet in his arm!
- Shut it.

59:51.354 --> 59:52.753
Oh, come on, Christ!

59:52.822 --> 59:56.258
They've punched his head
into a fucking canoe here!

59:56.326 --> 59:59.887
Brass knuckles.
Savages have got skills, I'll give you that.

59:59.963 --> 01:00:02.864
- Put them in their ponchos.
- It's a message.

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:08.065
They own this place.

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:14.370
That's enough. We pull out.

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.902
- We can't leave.
- We can and we are.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.005
We'll never make it
through those trees alive.

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:22.347
And even if we could,
then the financiers would...

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:25.046
- You know what happens if we leave.
- I'll take my chances.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:28.716
You won't have any chance
unless you start listening!

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.918
- I think that... If we could only get...
- Enough!

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.086
...the machine online, then maybe...

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:34.994
We've been compromised
by a superior force

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:36.554
and we are pulling out.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.329
You think a normal enemy would do that?

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:42.231
I've seen worse.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:45.297
You certainly will unless you start to listen.

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:48.743
Fine.

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:51.905
You want to stay? Go ahead.

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:57.078
Didn't think so.

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:05.123
...For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory for ever and ever. Amen.

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:07.458
What, you really believe that shite?

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:10.590
Like there's, you know, after?

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:13.135
I know a man's soul
deserves to rest in peace.

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:15.670
We gave up that right
when we started killing men

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:18.673
who believed in things for money.

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:20.265
Boy has got it.

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:23.275
Yeah, right, well, meantime...

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.147
I've got bills to pay in the real world, eh?

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:30.549
Cotter. Hunt's busy playing fuckwit
down there. Go and police him up, will you?

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.316
The rest of you,
I want out of here within the hour.

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.132
You prick.

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:48.653
Mr. Hunt,
I've been ordered to get you mobile, sir.

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:51.598
You wouldn't be in such a hurry
if you knew what was out there.

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:54.067
And what is that?

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:57.937
- We're all going to die.
- Right. Of boredom.

01:02:58.007 --> 01:03:00.567
Listening to you whine and complain.

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:15.115
Run!

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.463
- Are we good?
- What about Tak and Voyteche?

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:58.694
- It's too much weight to carry.
- And him?

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:00.065
Fuck him!

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:05.303
Shots fired! Clear!

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:08.104
- Where's the contact?
- Engine room, now!

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:12.238
Christ, come on, this way!

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:14.311
Shit.

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:15.475
Fuck!

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:26.292
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:30.595
All right. All right.

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:54.746
Someone want to tell me
what the fuck he's talking about?

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:58.851
- Thinks we're being stalked by dead Nazis.
- Ghosts?

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:01.419
I didn't get shot
by some fucking spectral entity, here.

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:02.862
These things are solid.

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:05.093
But the one that killed Cotter
vanished right in front of us.

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:07.067
So why don't they swoop down here
like God's own wrath

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:08.967
and take us out
right here and now, then, eh?

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:11.472
I don't know.
Maybe God's not in on this miracle.

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.839
What difference does it make? We're fucked.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.778
You said that, that machine of yours
was made to control them.

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:21.374
Not control, contain.
But they obviously got the maths wrong.

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:22.712
You know, for a smart man,
you don't say much

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:23.843
of anything useful, do you?

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.151
Now, the last time you found yourself
dealing with the undead, what did you do?

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:30.784
Fuck this bullshit.
There ain't nothing but men out there.

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:40.628
Jesus, Prior, why don't you just admit it?

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:44.161
It's real simple.
I can't see it, I don't believe in it.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.504
You don't believe in the dark?

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:51.842
How much you want to believe, right now?

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.475
You take a life, you take it for good.

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:59.077
There ain't nothing waiting on you.

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:01.684
Got it?

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:05.359
Okay, okay. Fuck. Okay.

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:31.952
Bring it on.

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:36.057
By early 1945, the party was over.

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:38.691
The war was essentially lost,

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:41.958
and the German military machine
was falling apart.

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:47.565
All the files show that the SS sent in
a unit to shut this place down.

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:51.572
And as far as I can see,
nobody walked out alive.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.007
So does your instruction manual say
what the fuck these things want?

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.635
Want? They don't want anything.

01:06:56.712 --> 01:06:59.909
They just do what they were trained to do.
They kill.

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:03.784
Those bodies we found...

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.286
Those were their bodies?

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:08.414
That might explain
why they stayed with the machine.

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:11.324
Any consciousness that remains
might believe that their only chance

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:14.158
- to live again is through it.
- Guys.

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:15.788
Yeah, that or they're just
the last poor fuckers

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.355
to walk through this bone-yard.

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:18.559
Guys!

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.340
Motherfuck!

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:40.217
- Prior!
- Where the hell is he...

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:51.728
- Well, that worked.
- So we can kill them, right?

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:55.567
His brains are all over the wall.
That's good enough for me.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.401
Oh, you're humming my balls!

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:04.441
Oh, shit!

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.509
- What was that?
- Jesus.

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:14.845
- Fuck!
- Mac?

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:16.816
Mac!

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:36.341
Oh, Christ.

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:38.437
You fucks!

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:40.448
You fucking animals.

01:08:40.515 --> 01:08:42.211
Fuck you all!

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.854
Why us, huh?

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:48.151
- Why us?
- Why not?

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:56.430
Always the same answer, isn't it?

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.861
Take a look, all of you.

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:05.270
You're no different to them out there.

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:08.935
Men who once had a purpose,
and now have nothing but death.

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:12.002
- Except we're not dead.
- Give it up.

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:15.209
They're gonna tear us to pieces here.
All of us.

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:18.341
They can try.

01:09:27.395 --> 01:09:31.354
When it's operating fully,
it emits a high-pitch frequency

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:35.563
that within a certain radius might act
as a counterbalance, neutralizing...

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:38.265
Blah-fucking-blah.
Can we use it to stop these things?

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.934
Do you mind? Those of us with brain cells
are trying to think.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.444
- I'll do you...
- Listen to the man.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.145
If it was designed to contain them,
then, theoretically, if I can get it going,

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:52.278
and you can get them in close,
we could trap them,

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:55.289
and leave ourselves an exit
out of this mess, maybe.

01:09:55.357 --> 01:09:57.587
- How close?
- I'd say 20, 30 meters.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.823
- Is he having a fucking laugh?
- You have a better idea?

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:03.524
But I don't know if I've got enough power.

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:08.161
Maybe if I can hard-wire the current
from that generator...

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:11.764
But we're gonna need some time
to get the sort of levels we're gonna need.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.365
Also, the machine was designed
to be operated by three men.

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:17.901
- I'm gonna have to work it on my own.
- I'll buy you time.

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.279
And how exactly
are we supposed to get them in here?

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:28.251
They want soldiers,

01:10:29.758 --> 01:10:31.749
let's give them soldiers.

01:10:34.196 --> 01:10:35.788
<i>We've got to lure them in.</i>

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:40.301
<i>So, we use ourselves as bait, and then run
a controlled retreat and bring them with us.</i>

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:43.395
I want fall-back positions every 50 feet.

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.707
We need wire out there, funnel them in.

01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:51.610
<i>Double up on the anti-personnel mines
all along the tree line.</i>

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:57.651
When they come, we need to draw them in,
close as possible.

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:00.154
Then, fall back in stages on me.

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:06.755
We need to shore up all the corridors.
Take them only where we want them to go.

01:11:06.862 --> 01:11:10.263
<i>Hold your positions for as long as possible.
Keep them interested.</i>

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:12.823
<i>But don't overextend your positions
and get yourselves caught.</i>

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:15.335
<i>I want your eyes open,
your movements clean</i>

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:16.803
<i>and your fire accurate.</i>

01:11:16.872 --> 01:11:20.933
Now, we're not gonna get them to that cell,
so, take them to the engine.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:23.137
- The closer, the better.
- What if Hunt can't get it done?

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.670
<i>What if they spring out
of thin air right behind us?</i>

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:29.411
<i>Then we're fucked.
Use what you can, whatever way you can.</i>

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.613
<i>Keep your focus. Balance is everything.</i>

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:38.592
<i>Don't fall back too late,
don't fall back too soon.</i>

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:42.290
- We need to draw them in.
- But they're fucking unstoppable.

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:44.059
Right.

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.794
So were we, once.

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:09.215
Never did care much for the great outdoors.

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:10.815
Yeah.

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:14.954
Ain't like we were gonna do good things
for the rest of our lives.

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.825
Fuck, we killed most everybody else.

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:22.894
I figure it's about time we touched gloves
with some Nazis, huh?

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:56.495
You know the one thing
they don't teach you in basic?

01:12:56.572 --> 01:13:01.032
No matter how bad things get,
there's always time

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:04.372
for another joint.

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:19.525
So, what do you do
when you're not being a soldier of fortune?

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.325
Drink.

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:35.835
You know, in every culture,

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:41.009
they believe all the souls
of the men you killed

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:44.184
haunt you for eternity.

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:49.850
Guess that's us fucked, eh?

01:13:56.732 --> 01:13:59.428
Okay. I think she's ready.

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:02.436
I really don't know how long it'll take
to generate enough power.

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:06.406
Well, keep the door locked until I come back
and knock it down.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.905
You do know how to use this?

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:07.463
Hail Mary, full of Grace...

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:32.220
Weapons free. Fall back on my command.

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:05.392
Hold your fire.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.426
Hold.

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:11.763
Easy. Hold.

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:15.962
Hold.

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:18.667
Firing!

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:31.216
Fall back!

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:36.851
Moving!

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.335
They're coming!

01:16:58.614 --> 01:16:59.876
Contact!

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.879
- Sarge!
- Jordan!

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:08.183
Moving!

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:10.422
Top, set.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:12.521
Moving!

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:16.257
- Bring it on!
- Prior, set.

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:18.327
Moving!

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:26.598
Holding. Holding. Holding.

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.576
- Fall back!
- Moving!

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:35.878
Set!

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:44.589
Prior. Prior!

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:30.135
Fall back!

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.633
Move!

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.110
Move it, move it!

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:43.481
- Hunt, come on!
- Hunt?

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:49.480
Hunt?

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:52.425
Move! Set?

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:55.292
Last stop! Do it now, for fuck's sake!

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.061
Right!

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:16.778
Come on!

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:41.369
We fucking did it!

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:43.736
Hunt?

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:52.115
It's time to leave, Mr. Hunt.

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:53.620
Smart moves.

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.103
No.

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:41.734
Shift it!

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:44.067
- Moving!
- Shit!

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.034
Sarge.

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:21.633
It's not gonna work.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.042
We're gonna have to find another way out.

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:25.272
Where?

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:33.314
There.

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.753
Get me up.

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.405
Well, go on, then.

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:30.391
Clear.

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:46.305
Fuck.
