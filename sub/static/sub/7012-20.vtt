WEBVTT

00:07.520 --> 00:09.600
Now, Michael...
Michael, for your yearbook picture...

00:09.640 --> 00:11.760
don't forget to do
the over-the-shoulder shot.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.800
That's the best one.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.120
Ah, yeah.
I love that pose.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.360
It makes me look coy.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.120
Oh. Hey, guys,
Tommy Hedges just got his picture taken...

00:25.160 --> 00:27.080
with a big, old booger.

00:27.160 --> 00:31.040
So, why were you
in Tommy Hedges's picture?

00:32.439 --> 00:35.520
So, wait. He had a booger,
and you didn't tell him?

00:35.600 --> 00:39.040
He'll find out.
It'll be in the yearbook.

00:39.080 --> 00:42.120
It's true.
That's how I found out I was adorable.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.120
No, seriously.

00:45.160 --> 00:48.720
The only thing more important than your
yearbook picture is your yearbook quote.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.720
Ah, I already
got that covered.

00:50.760 --> 00:54.560
My quote's gonna be,
"What a long, strange trip it's been."

00:54.640 --> 00:57.440
Yeah, that's freakin' profound.

00:57.480 --> 00:59.800
Kelso, every lame-o hippie...

00:59.880 --> 01:02.560
in the history of time
has used that quote.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.400
Well, yeah.
That's 'cause it's good.

01:05.480 --> 01:08.280
No, Michael. Your quote
has to be meaningful...

01:08.360 --> 01:10.240
so you can remember
the good times...

01:10.320 --> 01:13.680
when you're, like, 30,
with no reason left to live.

01:13.760 --> 01:18.600
Okay, hidden in Jackie's extremely
disturbing thought is a grain of truth.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.600
We need a really
good quote this year.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.720
Well, all the best quotes
are about things that mean a lot to you.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.760
Like, for example, me.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.520
Or my hair,
or my personality...

01:28.600 --> 01:32.040
or the sparkle I bring
to your dull, gray lives.

01:32.120 --> 01:35.440
Or the feeling of relief
we get when you leave the room.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.360
No. You know what?
We need a quote about all of us.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.840
- Like, maybe like how we all met.
- Remember how we first met?

01:43.920 --> 01:47.440
Oh, is this a sexy story?

01:47.520 --> 01:51.560
- It's really more sad than sexy.
- Yeah.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.800
That's pretty much
how it goes for you, isn't it?

01:54.840 --> 01:56.760
Yeah.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.480
Okay, now, got your brownies
for the new neighbors, Eric?

02:04.520 --> 02:06.440
Yes, Mommy.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.639
How do I look?

02:08.720 --> 02:12.040
- Well, you got a little something...
- Don't touch it!

02:12.120 --> 02:15.160
I had to sleep sitting up
to keep it like this.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.360
Well, I just hope these new neighbors
are better than the last one.

02:18.440 --> 02:21.560
That Gus Griffin
was a complete dumb-ass.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.120
Hiya, neighbors!

02:25.200 --> 02:27.880
Well, hello.
We were just coming to welcome you.

02:27.960 --> 02:32.120
Looks like we beat you to the punchity-punch.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.080
Oh, damn.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.280
I'm Bob Pinciotti.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.160
This is my daughter, Donna.
My wife Midge'll be over later.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.120
Her thumb's caught
in something right now.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.680
Well, we've all done that.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.640
I guess.

02:49.720 --> 02:53.240
Well, I'm Kitty,
and this is Red...

02:53.320 --> 02:56.640
and this is our son Eric.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.920
Eric, say hello to Donna.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.440
What are you looking at,
string bean?

03:10.760 --> 03:14.280
Wow.
You're strong.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:50.280 --> 03:52.880
That's... Yeah, go ahead and laugh.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.040
None of you were punched
by Madam Man-fist here.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.440
You were creepy.
What can I say?

03:59.480 --> 04:01.600
Forman beat up by a girl.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.880
Seems like only yesterday.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.440
Oh, wait. I think it happened
yesterday too.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.400
That's...
You like that story, Hyde?

04:08.480 --> 04:10.520
Maybe I should talk about
the first time you and I met.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.720
- No.
- <i>Yes.</i>

04:11.760 --> 04:12.880
- No!
- Yes.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.800
- You promised!
- I'm telling!

04:16.079 --> 04:17.959
Thanks for
walking me home, Steven.

04:18.040 --> 04:22.000
That redheaded girl
hits really hard.

04:22.079 --> 04:26.800
Some advice? Never let a girl
stand on your head like that.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.120
Bad for the rep.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.640
- Okay, Steven.
- And it's Hyde.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.640
Thanks, Hyde.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.640
Hey, wouldn't it be funny
if my last name was Seek?

04:36.720 --> 04:39.400
You know, Hyde and Seek!

04:39.440 --> 04:41.920
That's stupid.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.880
And you owe me a quarter.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.320
Well, now.
Who do we have here?

04:49.360 --> 04:51.280
This is Hyde.

04:51.360 --> 04:54.560
Oh, you have
a new little friend.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.520
Red, get the camera.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.400
I'm not his friend.
I'm a hired gun.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.080
Kitty, don't
embarrass the boy.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.440
Oh, don't be silly.
It's nice to have a new friend.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.760
Especially one who's so...

05:07.800 --> 05:09.720
dirty!

05:09.800 --> 05:11.720
You know what's fun?

05:18.480 --> 05:21.160
I'm sorry, Son.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.320
If you ever tell anyone
about this, I'll kill you.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.960
Now I have to kill you.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.640
I don't know.
I like to bathe with friends.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.120
They can reach places
you can't.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.560
Yeah. That's probably
best kept to yourself, buddy.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.120
You guys, look at Eric's
last-year's picture.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.200
The famous
makeup-covered zit.

05:56.280 --> 05:59.640
Look, I just wanted one year
of clear skin to remember.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.080
And if that means breaking out
the old powder puff...

06:02.160 --> 06:04.200
so be it.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.520
You've never really had
a zit-free picture.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.520
Remember the one
on his nose?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.520
Oh, and the one
on his lip?

06:11.600 --> 06:13.960
And the one on the one
on his lip?

06:14.000 --> 06:17.600
And the one we thought was a second
little alien Eric growing out of his cheek?

06:17.680 --> 06:20.160
I mean no harm to your planet.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.680
I will attack
if you attempt to pop me.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.280
Ah, zits.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.120
Hey, those days
are over, okay?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.120
I'm zit-free this year,
and you want to know why?

06:43.400 --> 06:45.600
I have become a man.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.840
No, I'm serious.
I am man. I am zitless.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.800
Hear me roar.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.800
That should be
our yearbook quote.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.320
What about a quote from
the happiest day of our lives?

06:57.400 --> 07:01.000
- When was that?
- The day you met me.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.880
And then Potsie says,
"Sit on it."

07:04.960 --> 07:07.880
Right to the Fonz's face!

07:07.920 --> 07:09.840
Now, that's brave!

07:09.920 --> 07:13.320
- Hey, what's with Donna?
- What? We're just friends.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.400
God, why would you even ask that?
I don't like her.

07:16.480 --> 07:20.840
Me and Donna?
It's... It's gross!

07:20.880 --> 07:24.160
Hey, man, I was just asking
why she wasn't in class today.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.880
Oh.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.840
Well, then, never mind.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.000
Busted!

07:33.360 --> 07:37.080
<i>Help! Americans, please help me!</i>

07:37.160 --> 07:40.880
- What was that?
- It's coming from in here.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.920
Oh, hello.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.080
Who the hell are you?

07:50.160 --> 07:52.680
I am the new
foreign exchange student.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.880
The football team asked me
if I wanted to "hang out."

07:55.960 --> 07:58.560
I shouldn't have said yes.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.240
I can't feel my legs.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.480
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna chuck it at him.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.480
No, man.
Leave him alone.

08:12.960 --> 08:17.000
Look, man, if those jocks try
to do this to you again, just come find me.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.240
Thanks.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.400
You are my best friend.
Let's hold hands.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.680
Uh, no.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.640
Let's go.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.440
- I'm Hyde.
- I'm Eric.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.120
- Oh, you're the one that loves Donna.
- I do not!

08:47.120 --> 08:49.080
Well, my name is...

09:02.240 --> 09:04.440
Okay, I'm not gonna
remember that.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.680
I know. Let's call him
Captain Poo-face!

09:13.520 --> 09:16.360
Oh! Ow! My eye!
God!

09:16.440 --> 09:18.560
Yeah, this happens a lot.

09:18.640 --> 09:22.240
I'm sure it does,
Donna lover.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.880
Aww! I forgot about
Captain Poo-face!

09:30.960 --> 09:33.080
And I did not
like her then!

09:33.160 --> 09:35.080
Damn!

09:35.120 --> 09:37.480
You know what I love
about Kelso?

09:37.520 --> 09:40.120
Hyde just keeps beating
the crap out of him.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.040
That is false!

09:44.080 --> 09:47.160
- Name one time!
- With pleasure.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.120
- I love mashed potatoes.
- Oh, yeah?

10:02.840 --> 10:05.480
Uh-oh.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.600
<i>Not my eye!</i>

10:15.680 --> 10:18.640
- Foul!
- You know what's foul?

10:18.720 --> 10:20.840
Your playing.

10:20.880 --> 10:25.000
Ow! Oh, that's my eye!
God!

10:31.520 --> 10:33.720
- Change it back.
- No.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.840
Change it back.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.640
No-o-o.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.840
<i>My eye!</i>

10:49.800 --> 10:52.360
Seriously, man.
You keep hurting my eye.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.120
That's a terrible story.

10:56.200 --> 11:00.120
- I'm not even in that one.
- That's what makes it good.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.600
Okay, people, please remain calm.
I'm still zit-free.

11:03.680 --> 11:07.440
I'm gonna make it.
I'm gonna make it!

11:07.480 --> 11:10.320
Okay, stop goofing around.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.840
We need to think
of a better memory.

11:12.880 --> 11:16.400
What about the day I met you?
All of you.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.880
You're gonna like Donna.
She's pretty cool, man.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.680
- Hyde!
- Wow! Sorry. Wow!

11:25.760 --> 11:27.880
- What?
- You're right. I like her!

11:27.920 --> 11:30.760
No, wait! I didn't see!
Wait!

11:31.920 --> 11:34.640
<i>Donna?</i>

11:34.720 --> 11:37.920
Now, that's
a good memory.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.840
Or should I say "mammary"?

11:44.280 --> 11:46.480
I don't want
to remember that story.

11:46.560 --> 11:50.520
It just reminds me that I'm the only one here
who's never seen Donna's jahoobs.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.000
Well, it's not like
you never tried.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.160
Oops, sorry!

11:56.240 --> 11:58.120
Aw, damn.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.760
Oops, sorry!
Aw, damn.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.800
Oops, sorry!

12:05.840 --> 12:07.760
Damn it!

12:12.200 --> 12:14.760
Hey, speaking of boobs...

12:14.840 --> 12:18.080
Forman's growin' one
out of his forehead.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.040
What?

12:20.120 --> 12:23.400
Oh, Eric, your curse
has returned.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.280
Yeah, and it needs a bra.

12:27.360 --> 12:30.520
Oh, yeah. Dolly Parton called your forehead.
She wants her boob back.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.940
God, I can actually see
this thing growing.

12:43.020 --> 12:45.900
It's like... Jiffy Pop.

12:45.980 --> 12:49.500
My friend once...
He had this really big zit.

12:49.540 --> 12:51.460
And he tried to pop it...

12:51.540 --> 12:55.100
and all the pus went into
his brain, and it killed him.

12:56.180 --> 12:58.340
Really, Kelso?
What friend?

12:58.420 --> 13:01.340
- You didn't know him.
- That's 'cause he doesn't exist.

13:01.420 --> 13:04.100
'Cause he's dead now!

13:04.180 --> 13:08.420
People, we are
losing focus here.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.420
Well, what is
our quote gonna be?

13:10.500 --> 13:13.980
And let's remember,
our goal is to have it be about me.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.580
I can't think about anything
right now except Forman's zit.

13:17.660 --> 13:19.660
It's hypnotic.

13:19.740 --> 13:24.220
- It sort of follows you around the room like the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>
- All right.

13:24.300 --> 13:27.180
Hey, you wanna know something
that's even funnier than Eric's zit?

13:27.260 --> 13:29.140
The day I met Jackie.

13:29.220 --> 13:32.220
You're Donna?
We haven't met before.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.300
I guess because
I'm richer than you.

13:34.340 --> 13:36.780
- Hey, Jackie.
- Ow!

13:36.860 --> 13:39.620
That hurt,
you lumberjack!

13:39.700 --> 13:42.420
Welcome to public school.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.940
I can't believe
I missed that.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.300
You know,
when you laugh...

13:51.380 --> 13:53.780
you get a little wrinkle
in your zit.

13:53.860 --> 13:56.900
It's got personality.

13:56.980 --> 14:00.340
Okay, well,
what am I supposed to do?

14:00.420 --> 14:02.620
It hurts way too much
to pop.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.700
Come here, man.
Let me see it.

14:05.700 --> 14:09.340
Aah! What?
Quit it!

14:09.420 --> 14:12.700
Yeah, Kelso's friend
died that way.

14:12.740 --> 14:15.740
Donna, he did!

14:15.820 --> 14:17.740
Whatever.

14:17.820 --> 14:20.900
Look, all I know is there's gotta be some
good quote off Jackie getting hit in the head.

14:20.980 --> 14:25.340
Like, "Awesome!
Jackie got hit in the head!"

14:25.420 --> 14:27.980
No. No, no.
That's a stupid story.

14:28.060 --> 14:31.580
You know, I want to remember the happy times.
Maybe something romantic.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.540
Ooh, like our first date.

14:33.620 --> 14:35.540
- Yeah.
- Let me tell it.

14:35.620 --> 14:37.620
Red, Michael's in the fort
with another girl.

14:40.420 --> 14:44.140
All right. Everybody out.

14:44.220 --> 14:47.660
Michael Kelso, have you been playing doctor
with the Burkhart girl?

14:47.740 --> 14:50.660
No. I am a doctor.

14:50.740 --> 14:53.580
Good one.

14:55.340 --> 14:57.580
I mean, uh,
you're a very bad boy.

14:57.660 --> 14:59.540
Don't yell at him!

14:59.620 --> 15:01.540
I love him.

15:02.940 --> 15:05.020
Michael, that was
not our first date!

15:05.100 --> 15:07.100
Yeah, but I got
further on that day...

15:07.140 --> 15:10.020
than I did on our actual first date,
so that's what I like to remember.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.940
Yeah, you made a great impression
on my parents that year.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.780
Hi, Mr. Forman.
Is Eric home?

15:23.820 --> 15:26.740
Um, yes...

15:26.820 --> 15:28.700
but, uh...

15:28.780 --> 15:30.700
Kitty?

15:35.780 --> 15:37.700
Oh, my.

15:37.780 --> 15:40.260
Michael, honey, did you
maybe forget something?

15:40.340 --> 15:42.180
What?

15:42.260 --> 15:44.100
My pants!

15:50.820 --> 15:54.380
Why doesn't anyone
just tell nice stories?

15:54.460 --> 15:56.860
Everyone can think of a quote.
I mean, why can't we?

15:56.940 --> 15:58.860
Hey, why don't we use
Lisa Manning's?

15:58.940 --> 16:01.420
"Hangin' at the mall.
Kahlúa and ice cream.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.140
Bobby Sutton's a god.
Yeah!"

16:05.540 --> 16:07.460
God, this is so sad.

16:07.540 --> 16:10.580
It's like, what have we
been doing with our lives?

16:12.060 --> 16:15.340
Hey, Kelso,
who's got stronger powers...

16:15.420 --> 16:17.300
<i>I Dream of Jeannie...</i>

16:17.380 --> 16:20.220
or Samantha
from <i>Bewitched?</i>

16:20.260 --> 16:23.140
That's easy.
Samantha.

16:23.180 --> 16:25.220
Witches totally beat genies...

16:25.300 --> 16:27.220
'cause witches can fly.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.180
Game over.

16:30.660 --> 16:33.940
Hey, why does Jeannie wear
those see-through clothes?

16:34.020 --> 16:36.060
It's gross.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.100
And it makes me
feel funny.

16:43.140 --> 16:45.860
No way is Samantha
hotter than Jeannie!

16:45.940 --> 16:49.380
Hey, I heard they made
an episode they never aired...

16:49.460 --> 16:51.700
where Jeannie
gets totally naked.

16:51.780 --> 16:53.660
The government banned it.

16:55.220 --> 16:58.860
All I know is, with one little nose twitch...

16:58.940 --> 17:01.100
Samantha's clothes
could be off!

17:01.180 --> 17:03.060
And that's hot.

17:05.780 --> 17:07.940
What if you didn't
have to choose?

17:08.020 --> 17:11.579
What if you could be
with both at the same time?

17:14.579 --> 17:16.500
Is that legal?

17:17.859 --> 17:19.980
Hey, man,
if you don't get caught...

17:20.060 --> 17:21.940
everything's legal.

17:22.020 --> 17:23.859
Stolen pretzel?

17:24.819 --> 17:27.660
Guys, this conversation is over.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.620
Yesterday, Samantha
went back in time.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.260
That trumps anything
Jeannie ever did.

17:33.380 --> 17:36.740
Oh, yeah?
Well, Jeannie can freeze time.

17:36.820 --> 17:40.180
So, Samantha would go back,
and Jeannie could just freeze her there.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.180
Who kicked whose ass then?

17:43.900 --> 17:45.820
You know what would
decide this whole thing?

17:45.900 --> 17:49.500
A little Samantha-on-Jeannie
mud wrestling.

17:49.540 --> 17:52.300
I'd pay a dollar
to see that.

17:52.380 --> 17:55.060
All I know is,
Samantha helps Darrin at work...

17:55.140 --> 17:57.580
but what does Jeannie do
for Major Nelson?

17:57.660 --> 18:00.700
Turns his boss
into a monkey.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.700
This is not helpful.

18:04.540 --> 18:07.420
I've got to call Major Nelson's
sexuality into question here.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.900
I mean, any guy who's got
a half-naked genie...

18:09.980 --> 18:11.900
He's got her doing
more than his laundry.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.940
Hey, you know
what would be best?

18:15.020 --> 18:17.700
Samantha's hair,
Jeannie's pretty bottle room...

18:17.780 --> 18:19.700
and Wonder Woman's
accessories.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.420
Hey, guys.

18:25.500 --> 18:29.340
We've been talking about this
for a really, really long time.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.340
Oh! Ooh!

18:42.660 --> 18:45.180
I got it!
I got the quote!

18:45.220 --> 18:49.140
"What a long, strange trip it's been
in Forman's basement."

18:49.220 --> 18:52.980
Yeah. We have made a lot
of memories in that basement.

18:53.060 --> 18:55.420
Too bad we can't
remember any of 'em.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.980
All right, you guys.
I think it's ready.

18:58.020 --> 18:59.940
I'm off to pop.

19:00.020 --> 19:01.940
Wait a minute.
I hate that quote.

19:02.020 --> 19:05.060
My name isn't anywhere
in that quote.

19:05.140 --> 19:08.340
Okay, fine. You know,
I'll just make my quote...

19:08.420 --> 19:10.780
"What a long, strange trip
it's been...

19:10.820 --> 19:13.500
with Jackie Burkhart."

19:13.580 --> 19:15.540
Yeah, okay...

19:15.620 --> 19:18.340
but without
the "long, strange trip" part.

19:18.420 --> 19:20.860
- All right. So I'll just write...
- "I love Jackie Burkhart."

19:20.940 --> 19:22.980
Okay.

19:23.060 --> 19:26.500
Okay, guys, I did it.
Looks better, right?

19:30.220 --> 19:33.140
Great. All right.
Picture time.

19:33.220 --> 19:36.180
Yeah, I'll meet you guys in there.
I gotta change my blouse.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.940
Everybody out.

19:44.540 --> 19:46.700
- Oops, sorry!
- Kelso!

19:48.340 --> 19:51.700
Kelso, we just talked
about this today!

19:51.780 --> 19:56.020
Well, damn, Donna.
If you'd just let me see 'em, I'd stop.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.500
Fine.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.620
They're beautiful.
