18:39.652 --> 18:41.652
So michael lied.
It's worse than that.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.438
Turns out that --
sally langston

18:43.439 --> 18:45.223
Has got some guy named
phillip reed booked
on her next show.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.491
I think he's gonna say
he's --

18:46.493 --> 18:48.143
Having an affair
with michael.

18:48.144 --> 18:49.794
How did you know?
I pulled
michael's cell records,

18:49.796 --> 18:51.429
Did a search
for most-called numbers,

18:51.431 --> 18:52.797
Came up with phillip,
triangulated cellphone towers

18:52.799 --> 18:54.532
To track him to the vicinity
of his office server,

18:54.534 --> 18:56.501
And then i hacked
into their e-mail system.
How'd you find out?

18:56.503 --> 18:57.835
I listened to all of

18:57.837 --> 18:59.203
Leo's voice-mails
when he was in the bathroom.

18:59.205 --> 19:00.905
Well,
that's another way to go.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.091
Let's go.

<i>The liberty report --</i>
<i>sunday at 8:00.</i>

19:12.719 --> 19:15.253
So, apparently, michael's
been seeing this guy

19:15.255 --> 19:17.221
On and off
for seven months.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.823
So he lied.
He lied.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.891
That's what he does best.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.459
Then we need to cancel
the wedding.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.727
Abby: Oh, we can't cancel
the wedding.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.661
The optics of that alone...

19:23.663 --> 19:25.029
Everything's already booked.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.396
It'd be a public-relations
nightmare.

19:26.397 --> 19:27.763
It already<i> is</i>
a public-relations nightmare.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.268
This guy is set to appear
on sally's show on sunday.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.403
I agree. Call it off.
I'm sorry, cyrus.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.572
No one is calling anything off.
No one is quitting --

19:34.574 --> 19:36.507
Not until i've tried
everything -- everything!

19:36.509 --> 19:38.276

Cyrus, talk to him.

Did olivia tell you
to come here?

She says you're worried i'm
going to ruin your career.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.306
"cripple your journalistic
integrity,"

20:42.308 --> 20:43.841
I believe were
the words she used.

I didn't tell her that,
but she's right.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.913

cyrus beene's husband,

to be a journalist,

that i'm your lapdog.

Does that make sense?
Of course it does.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.792
I'm never gonna ask you
to do that --

Very old, rare,

Because i was supposed
to give it to you.
