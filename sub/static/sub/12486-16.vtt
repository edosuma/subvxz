00:01.500 --> 00:03.501
<i>Chyna: Previously on a.N.T. Farm...</i>

00:03.769 --> 00:05.102
The name is Ticonderoga.

00:05.671 --> 00:07.005
Dixon Ticonderoga.

00:08.607 --> 00:10.642
So, Olive, how about we take my helicopter

00:10.743 --> 00:13.011
and go grab some dinner
in Sonoma? I'd love to.

00:13.111 --> 00:14.445
(Helicopter whirring)

00:15.180 --> 00:17.181
Olive, this is my girlfriend, Oksana.

00:17.516 --> 00:19.683
Oksana, this is my ex-girlfriend, Olive.

00:19.984 --> 00:21.018
Ex-girlfriend?

00:21.386 --> 00:22.386
Oops.

00:22.487 --> 00:23.887
I skipped that part, didn't I?

00:25.557 --> 00:27.291
Olive? Are you feeling better?

00:27.692 --> 00:30.294
I'll never find another guy!

00:31.729 --> 00:33.230
Look, I know we fight all the time,

00:34.032 --> 00:35.098
but I'm always here for you.

00:41.439 --> 00:42.439
What just happened?

00:42.774 --> 00:44.374
Your face bumped into my lips!

00:44.709 --> 00:45.776
No, you kissed me! And...

00:46.210 --> 00:47.477
I don't feel like vomiting.

00:47.745 --> 00:50.080
Me neither. What is happening?

00:53.617 --> 00:56.686
Uh... Hello, Fletcher.

00:57.354 --> 00:59.189
Lovely weather we're having.

01:01.258 --> 01:02.225
Hello, Olive.

01:02.326 --> 01:04.060
How are your stocks performing?

01:05.662 --> 01:07.496
Okay, this is just weird.

01:07.598 --> 01:10.432
Although my stocks are actually
doing quite well, thank you.

01:11.068 --> 01:13.836
Sorry, I guess I'm just a
little freaked out after the...

01:14.237 --> 01:15.871
Lip touching thing.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.375
Yeah, that, uh, lip touching thing was...

01:21.111 --> 01:22.544
Unexpected.

01:23.779 --> 01:25.947
Unexpected like winning the lottery?

01:26.048 --> 01:28.283
Or unexpected like
getting mauled by a bear?

01:31.020 --> 01:33.888
Though lottery winner's experience
an immediate sense of euphoria,

01:34.090 --> 01:35.957
it often devolves into
a miserable existence

01:36.058 --> 01:39.161
marred by alienation, lawsuits,
and broken relationships.

01:40.663 --> 01:42.396
While bear attack
survivors, on the other hand,

01:42.498 --> 01:45.600
often develop a new
appreciation and zest for life.

01:46.936 --> 01:49.904
So kissing you was as good
as being mauled by a bear.

01:51.107 --> 01:52.173
Thanks, Olive.

01:52.274 --> 01:53.842
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

01:57.812 --> 02:00.148
Hey, guys. What's going on? Uh...

02:00.782 --> 02:03.050
Help! Olive's trying to steal my wallet!

02:03.918 --> 02:04.952
What?

02:05.354 --> 02:08.656
You were just... About to blow
my scary stranger whistle on you!

02:08.757 --> 02:09.757
(Whistles)

02:10.692 --> 02:11.892
(Chuckles) Okay.

02:11.993 --> 02:14.494
I am not going to let another
Fletcher-Olive argument

02:14.763 --> 02:16.096
ruin my perfect day.

02:16.464 --> 02:18.832
I won a package of pencils
in the student lottery!

02:20.568 --> 02:22.269
Hey, Chyna. Can I have a pencil?

02:22.971 --> 02:24.271
Look, Angus.

02:24.706 --> 02:26.907
Everyone's been asking me for pencils,

02:28.109 --> 02:30.443
and I already sent three home to my family.

02:31.579 --> 02:34.214
Look, I'm so sorry, but I just can't.

02:34.515 --> 02:37.050
Fine, Chyna! I thought we were friends!

02:39.287 --> 02:42.455
You know, having pencils has changed you.

02:44.792 --> 02:51.530
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh doo, doo ♪
ooh, ooh doo, doo Whoo!</i>

02:51.631 --> 02:53.265
<i>♪ Everybody's got that thing</i>

03:29.035 --> 03:34.472
<i>♪ ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ooh, ooh Whoo!</i>

03:39.878 --> 03:41.212
Hey, Olive.

03:41.313 --> 03:43.214
I'm sorry I accused you of stealing
my wallet in front of Chyna.

03:43.449 --> 03:45.316
Yeah, I did not appreciate that.

03:45.784 --> 03:46.951
First of all, I don't steal.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.386
I just needed to borrow some lunch money.

03:50.256 --> 03:53.423
Second of all, it's really
more of a ladies' change purse.

03:55.227 --> 03:57.862
You actually took my change... Wallet?

04:00.198 --> 04:01.565
I was just covering because I didn't want

04:01.666 --> 04:03.868
Chyna to know that you and I are...

04:05.137 --> 04:06.470
What are we now?

04:08.306 --> 04:09.939
Labels aren't important.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.909
All that matters is that
your money is my money now.

04:15.079 --> 04:16.146
Wait.

04:16.247 --> 04:18.014
Why don't you want Chyna to know about us?

04:18.382 --> 04:20.183
Well, we're all such good friends.

04:20.485 --> 04:22.252
I just don't want things
between us to be weird.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.354
I say when she's around,

04:24.455 --> 04:26.990
we just pretend like everything
between us is the way it always was.

04:27.457 --> 04:28.691
So be viciously mean to each other?

04:28.793 --> 04:30.093
Exactly. (Elevator bell dings)

04:32.963 --> 04:34.230
Hey, guys.

04:34.331 --> 04:35.531
Look at this.

04:35.632 --> 04:38.567
I have even less pencil than
I did before I won the lottery.

04:40.271 --> 04:43.071
Well, at least that pencil
is sharper than Fletcher!

04:44.708 --> 04:46.676
Yeah? Well, you punch like a girl!

04:48.912 --> 04:50.680
(Quietly) A very powerful girl!

04:51.615 --> 04:52.682
Chyna: That's enough!

04:52.783 --> 04:54.149
I've watched you fight for three years.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.518
This has got to stop.

04:57.220 --> 04:58.954
And I know just how to do it.

04:59.588 --> 05:02.490
Lock us in a room together, alone,
and leave us there for hours?

05:03.960 --> 05:07.529
Yeah! Just the two of us,
alone, having a make up session.

05:09.665 --> 05:11.633
Actually, I have a better idea...

05:12.969 --> 05:14.703
This is your better idea?

05:16.238 --> 05:17.271
The z-walk?

05:17.707 --> 05:19.341
You know I'm acrophobic!

05:19.608 --> 05:21.743
And I'm falling-to-my-death-
and-ending-up-a-bloody-stain...

05:21.844 --> 05:23.378
to-be-eaten
by-crows-aphobic!

05:25.881 --> 05:29.150
I can't believe tourists actually
pay good money to do this!

05:29.251 --> 05:31.518
I am definitely not
buying the souvenir photo!

05:32.888 --> 05:34.021
(Camera clicks)

05:35.858 --> 05:37.892
Look, you two need to
learn how to get along.

05:38.093 --> 05:39.793
And the strongest emotional connections

05:39.895 --> 05:43.331
are forged between people who survive
life or death situations together.

05:43.598 --> 05:47.801
War buddies, bank hostages, members
of a bear attack survivors group.

05:48.670 --> 05:51.972
Gah! She's proven her point
with an interesting factoid!

05:54.809 --> 05:57.143
(Gasps) This is the
best book I've ever read.

05:59.247 --> 06:00.280
Hey, Lexi.

06:00.715 --> 06:01.849
Can't you see I'm reading?

06:02.149 --> 06:03.149
(Gasping)

06:03.351 --> 06:05.285
Oh! This is the best part!

06:08.089 --> 06:10.623
(Gasps) Oh, no, this is the best part!

06:12.693 --> 06:15.695
(Gasps) This book just keep
getting better and better!

06:17.198 --> 06:19.432
Don't you have any
interests besides yourself?

06:20.134 --> 06:21.967
Yeah. I like reading.

06:23.904 --> 06:26.372
Besides, there are no cool
activities at this school.

06:26.840 --> 06:30.109
Actually, there are a number of
fascinating clubs you can join here.

06:30.977 --> 06:34.714
In fact, I'm heading out right now
to a meeting of the dating club.

06:34.815 --> 06:35.948
Dating club?

06:36.049 --> 06:37.149
I'll join that.

06:37.250 --> 06:38.750
Let me just finish my book.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.653
(Gasping) Wow!

06:41.754 --> 06:43.588
I did not see that ending coming.

06:45.158 --> 06:46.491
I loved it!

06:48.461 --> 06:49.929
(Wind whooshing) (Screaming)

06:50.630 --> 06:52.097
Okay, okay! It worked!

06:52.532 --> 06:53.899
Olive and I are friends now.

06:54.467 --> 06:56.334
But we haven't gotten
to the danger part yet.

06:56.769 --> 06:58.169
Both: We haven't?

06:59.171 --> 07:03.442
Maybe you'd care more about
Fletcher if you lost him forever!

07:04.176 --> 07:05.176
(Screaming)

07:07.146 --> 07:08.680
No!

07:09.916 --> 07:11.749
See? You care.

07:12.017 --> 07:14.185
He's dead! Fletcher is dead!

07:14.286 --> 07:15.286
Chyna: No, he isn't.

07:15.620 --> 07:17.422
While you two were peeing your windpants,

07:18.790 --> 07:20.491
the roomavator moved to ground level.

07:20.725 --> 07:22.060
Fletcher fell two feet.

07:23.562 --> 07:24.562
Fletcher: Yeah.

07:25.797 --> 07:27.297
Into the cactus garden.

07:29.067 --> 07:32.570
Fletcher! Oh, thank goodness you're alive!

07:34.072 --> 07:35.238
And ow!

07:39.544 --> 07:42.312
Wow. This worked even better
than I thought it would.

07:44.482 --> 07:45.949
Wait. What's going on here?

07:48.353 --> 07:50.354
Okay, the truth is...

07:51.456 --> 07:52.889
Fletcher and I are a couple now.

07:53.157 --> 07:54.157
What?

07:54.558 --> 07:55.558
What?

07:57.261 --> 07:59.896
You're going out with my Olive?

08:02.366 --> 08:03.366
(Camera clicks)

08:10.107 --> 08:12.074
I'm here for the dating club.

08:16.779 --> 08:18.447
This is the dating club?

08:19.649 --> 08:21.317
Yeah! Carbon dating.

08:22.619 --> 08:24.686
We measure the levels of carbon decay

08:24.787 --> 08:28.424
to determine the age of fossils
and other unearthed remains.

08:29.092 --> 08:33.128
Like this partially decomposed
australopithecus skeleton.

08:34.563 --> 08:35.597
You're dating him?

08:36.399 --> 08:38.567
Well, I guess he's a step up from Fletcher.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.570
This club is stupid!

08:42.572 --> 08:46.909
How is this club we found next
to australopithecus stupid?

08:47.276 --> 08:49.277
It's evidence of rudimentary tool making!

08:50.279 --> 08:53.648
I mean this school needs
some fun activities.

08:53.916 --> 08:55.716
Like a cheerleading squad.

08:57.053 --> 08:59.687
Which this now officially is!

09:01.790 --> 09:02.890
Can she do that?

09:05.161 --> 09:06.861
Yeah, I think she can.

09:08.897 --> 09:11.131
Now! First order of business,

09:11.499 --> 09:14.101
I nominate myself as head cheerleader.

09:14.670 --> 09:17.071
Anyone want to second the nomination?

09:20.609 --> 09:21.609
(As skeleton) I will!

09:23.178 --> 09:24.178
She's gorgeous!

09:25.613 --> 09:26.613
(All gasping)

09:28.416 --> 09:30.417
It's okay, I forgive you.

09:31.252 --> 09:32.619
High five? (Chuckles)

09:35.190 --> 09:37.624
So you guys are dating each other?

09:37.858 --> 09:39.793
No, we're going out.

09:39.894 --> 09:42.963
I know how old he is without
measuring his level of carbon decay.

09:45.032 --> 09:46.165
By the way, I hope you know

09:46.266 --> 09:48.568
I'm missing a very important
club meeting for this.

09:50.170 --> 09:52.706
I am so happy for you guys.

09:53.007 --> 09:54.140
You're my two best friends.

09:54.241 --> 09:55.575
Why would you keep it secret from me?

09:55.875 --> 09:57.343
Well, that was Fletcher's idea.

09:58.011 --> 09:59.078
That's weird.

09:59.179 --> 10:00.379
Fletcher had an idea?

10:02.282 --> 10:03.616
He's never had an idea before.

10:03.717 --> 10:05.751
What would motivate you to have an idea?

10:06.420 --> 10:07.953
I have no idea.

10:09.856 --> 10:11.357
Anyway, I'm glad you're not upset.

10:16.162 --> 10:17.930
That's why Fletcher didn't
want to tell you about us!

10:18.031 --> 10:19.364
He's still in love with you!

10:19.699 --> 10:20.666
What are you talking about?

10:20.767 --> 10:21.900
You kept it a secret, too.

10:22.002 --> 10:23.502
Not just from you, from everyone!

10:23.803 --> 10:25.470
I'm dating Fletcher! It's humiliating!

10:27.173 --> 10:29.040
But Fletcher dating zazow?

10:31.144 --> 10:33.145
He should want to tell the whole world!

10:34.380 --> 10:35.713
Olive, don't be silly.

10:35.814 --> 10:37.315
You're looking for problems
where they don't exist.

10:37.517 --> 10:38.916
That's what I do!

10:40.486 --> 10:44.088
Look, I just don't want to get hurt
again like when Dixon dumped me.

10:44.190 --> 10:46.257
I need to know for sure if
Fletcher is still in love with you

10:46.358 --> 10:47.959
and there's only one way to find out.

10:48.393 --> 10:50.528
Well, from that crazed look in your eye,

10:50.629 --> 10:52.930
I'm guessing that way
is not just asking him?

10:54.332 --> 10:55.432
Of course not!

10:55.534 --> 10:57.168
The obvious approach is
for you to tempt Fletcher

10:57.269 --> 10:59.003
by flirting with him while I watch.

10:59.371 --> 11:00.437
Are you crazy?

11:00.539 --> 11:01.705
What kind of question is that?

11:01.806 --> 11:03.274
You see the look in my eye?

11:10.649 --> 11:11.815
(Elevator dings)

11:12.651 --> 11:13.651
(Screaming)

11:15.820 --> 11:17.488
Hey, Angus. What's up?

11:18.189 --> 11:20.824
Olive is the love of
my life! How could you?

11:21.926 --> 11:23.894
I'm sorry, it just happened.

11:24.228 --> 11:27.898
But, to be fair, I don't think you
ever really had any shot with her.

11:30.301 --> 11:34.671
Well, if you stole the girl
I never had any shot with,

11:34.771 --> 11:37.440
then I'll steal the girl
you never had any shot with!

11:37.774 --> 11:38.974
You'll have to be more specific.

11:39.076 --> 11:40.743
That could literally be any girl.

11:42.713 --> 11:44.480
I'm talking about Chyna.

11:45.416 --> 11:48.084
You? Go out with Chyna? Yup.

11:48.619 --> 11:49.985
I'm not going to enjoy it,

11:50.454 --> 11:52.354
and she's not going to enjoy it,

11:53.690 --> 11:56.425
but most of all, you're
not going to enjoy it!

11:58.095 --> 12:01.831
It's one of those "lose, lose, lose"
situations where everybody wins.

12:03.133 --> 12:04.566
Except you!

12:05.102 --> 12:06.268
And me.

12:07.437 --> 12:08.570
And Chyna!

12:12.475 --> 12:14.710
I really do not want
to flirt with Fletcher.

12:15.278 --> 12:17.112
Why, he's not cute enough for you?

12:17.447 --> 12:18.480
No, he's cute.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.282
You think he's cute?

12:21.618 --> 12:24.285
He is my boyfriend, Chyna! Hands off!

12:24.987 --> 12:26.454
Now go try to steal him from me.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.658
Hey, Fletcher. I was wondering

12:30.760 --> 12:32.093
if you wanted to go to
the movies or something.

12:32.194 --> 12:33.628
Sorry, I can't. I have plans with Olive.

12:33.729 --> 12:34.896
Okay, no problem.

12:37.066 --> 12:38.967
There. Satisfied? No!

12:39.401 --> 12:40.801
You call that flirting?

12:41.370 --> 12:43.003
(Scoffs) No wonder you
don't have a boyfriend.

12:44.906 --> 12:46.807
Well... You need to make more of an effort.

12:46.908 --> 12:49.443
Make yourself impossible to resist.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.145
Like how?

12:53.782 --> 12:54.982
Like this.

12:56.718 --> 13:00.420
Now that you have the look down, you
need to work on your flirting skills.

13:00.721 --> 13:03.023
Pretend I'm Fletcher. Okay.

13:03.591 --> 13:05.358
Fletcher, get out of my room!

13:06.060 --> 13:07.060
Flirt with me!

13:07.762 --> 13:08.862
Okay! (Sighs)

13:10.598 --> 13:11.999
Hey there, Fletcher.

13:12.533 --> 13:16.102
We've been ignoring this
mutual attraction for too long.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.838
I think it's time we stop pretending

13:19.607 --> 13:21.841
and just go for it. (Kisses)

13:24.378 --> 13:26.513
What the heck was that?

13:27.915 --> 13:29.115
That was terrible!

13:29.216 --> 13:30.950
You didn't mention one interesting factoid!

13:31.051 --> 13:33.019
We have a lot of work to do.

13:36.990 --> 13:40.259
Lexi, do we really have to do this?
- Yes!

13:40.660 --> 13:43.529
I am determined to have
some fun at this school.

13:43.630 --> 13:44.797
But don't worry.

13:44.898 --> 13:46.932
Cheerleading is easy. Watch.

13:48.034 --> 13:50.268

14:18.197 --> 14:19.464
All: Letter!

14:20.599 --> 14:23.368
Guys, you need to focus!

14:23.769 --> 14:25.903
And I don't mean the
lenses on your microscope.

14:30.476 --> 14:31.909
Lexi's right. (Sighs)

14:32.010 --> 14:34.178
I guess we could cheer
at the big game tomorrow.

14:34.613 --> 14:35.646
There's a big game?

14:35.748 --> 14:36.947
(Gasping) Is it football?

14:37.715 --> 14:39.049
Or basketball?

14:39.684 --> 14:41.285
Computer programming!

14:42.387 --> 14:45.923

14:56.901 --> 14:57.901
Okay!

14:58.168 --> 15:01.505
There's Fletcher. Now,
remember, stick to the script.

15:01.972 --> 15:03.640
Now work it, girl!

15:07.044 --> 15:08.445
(Sighs) Hey!

15:10.381 --> 15:12.048
Hey, Chyna. New look?

15:13.083 --> 15:14.317
(Chuckles) Yeah.

15:14.885 --> 15:17.387
Speaking of looks, you look
really good in those orange jeans.

15:17.955 --> 15:19.755
Interesting factoid about jeans,

15:20.657 --> 15:21.925
or denim dungarees...

15:23.160 --> 15:27.830
Although originally designed for
cowboys, starting in the 1950s,

15:28.031 --> 15:30.999
they became popular with
continued on other arm.

15:32.068 --> 15:33.101
Chyna: Oh.

15:33.970 --> 15:35.304
Teenagers. (Chuckles)

15:37.006 --> 15:39.041
Chyna, I see what you're up to.

15:39.643 --> 15:41.276
I'm not up to anything.

15:41.377 --> 15:42.777
I'm just the same old Chyna.

15:42.878 --> 15:44.246
This is what I'm like.

15:44.914 --> 15:46.014
Zazow.

15:47.850 --> 15:52.454
Obviously, you got yourself all gussied
up in those come hither clothes

15:52.555 --> 15:55.824
and are whispering sweet factoids
into my ear to impress me.

15:57.293 --> 15:59.360
Sorry, Chyna, you missed the boat.

15:59.762 --> 16:01.429
It's Olive's boat now.

16:01.530 --> 16:02.931
(Whispers) I'm the boat.

16:04.533 --> 16:05.800
Okay then.

16:06.001 --> 16:07.068
Good.

16:07.269 --> 16:09.136
You don't have to put
on a brave face for me.

16:09.705 --> 16:10.972
I know how you feel.

16:11.206 --> 16:12.306
Believe it or not, there was a time

16:12.407 --> 16:14.709
I had a huge crush on a girl
and she didn't like me back.

16:15.110 --> 16:16.543
You don't say.

16:17.679 --> 16:21.349
But her not liking me was the best
thing that could have happened.

16:21.616 --> 16:24.618
I ended up with someone
so much better than her.

16:25.988 --> 16:29.290
Someone cuter, sweeter, smarter...

16:29.824 --> 16:32.092
Well, I bet the first girl was really cute

16:32.494 --> 16:34.294
and sweet and smart, too.

16:34.395 --> 16:35.562
No. Not really.

16:37.999 --> 16:39.933
Anyway, hope that makes you feel better!

16:43.137 --> 16:44.237
Wow.

16:44.338 --> 16:45.839
He is really over you.

16:46.674 --> 16:47.841
I told you. (Chuckles)

16:47.942 --> 16:51.277
Now, uh, I'm just gonna
go cry into my Teddy bear.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.481
Did you see that?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.049
Chyna was flirting with me.

16:56.317 --> 16:59.319
(Scoffs) Obviously, Olive put her up to it.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.654
She was just using Chyna to test you.

17:02.923 --> 17:04.023
What?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.826
I can't believe Olive was manipulating me.

17:07.895 --> 17:09.896
Two can play at that game. Actually,

17:09.997 --> 17:12.397
"manipulation" is a game
for three to eight players.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.471
It's also for ages 10 and up.

17:21.473 --> 17:22.840
I'm 14.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.276
You're 14?

17:24.944 --> 17:27.311
I just thought you were a
second grader that draws well.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.820
All right, handsome, you can do this.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.723
Pretend you're attracted to Chyna.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.961
It won't be easy, but you
must make Fletcher suffer.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.303
Wow, you look like Olive!

17:54.040 --> 17:55.173
Go away, Angus.

17:55.274 --> 17:56.740
Wow, you sound like Olive!

17:58.710 --> 18:00.611
Well, here's something else Olive would do.

18:03.848 --> 18:04.915
Indeed!

18:06.518 --> 18:08.018
The hunt is on!

18:11.957 --> 18:12.957
(Elevator dings)

18:13.592 --> 18:15.292
Hey, my ol-love.

18:16.995 --> 18:19.396
I got you a present for
our two day anniversary.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.932
Aw, you didn't have to do that,

18:22.033 --> 18:24.802
even though I expressly
told you you had to.

18:25.403 --> 18:26.937
What'd you get me?

18:28.306 --> 18:29.339
Clothes?

18:29.907 --> 18:31.575
Yeah! Put 'em on.

18:33.578 --> 18:35.112
You want me to wear this?

18:36.414 --> 18:37.614
Don't worry.

18:37.715 --> 18:40.150
It'll look even better with the necklace.

18:42.353 --> 18:43.353
Uh...

18:43.787 --> 18:46.355
I don't understand why you
want me to dress like this.

18:47.224 --> 18:49.158
I just think it makes
you look more attractive.

18:49.459 --> 18:51.628
In fact, to complete the look...

18:56.667 --> 18:58.200
But now my hair has two colors!

18:58.301 --> 19:00.802
How will I accurately
fill out government forms?

19:04.007 --> 19:05.007
(Keyboard clicks)

19:05.542 --> 19:06.575
You got no game!

19:06.876 --> 19:09.111
You probably got a c+ in c++!

19:10.247 --> 19:14.350
Hey! The only c+ I ever got
was in trash-talking class!

19:14.917 --> 19:16.452
So take that you...

19:17.253 --> 19:18.920
Worthy opponent.

19:20.456 --> 19:23.458
Come on, guys. Angus needs our support.

19:23.559 --> 19:24.826
Time for our first cheer.

19:25.227 --> 19:28.096
Just give it your best shot and look alive.

19:28.631 --> 19:30.465
Especially you, australopithecus!

What in the name of pom-poms was
that steaming pile of herkie?

20:02.964 --> 20:07.634
Your rhythm was off, your arms
were flailing, and, worst of all,

20:07.735 --> 20:10.070
you momentarily blocked my face!

20:12.173 --> 20:15.909
I am sick of you nerdy, worthless weirdos!

20:17.579 --> 20:18.878
Here's your next routine...

20:19.214 --> 20:21.114
Punch yourselves in the face!

20:22.517 --> 20:24.283
Because I don't have time to go around

20:24.384 --> 20:26.519
and do it to each and
every one of you losers!

20:28.122 --> 20:29.122
(Growls)

20:31.558 --> 20:32.558
Wow.

20:32.960 --> 20:36.362
I know we weren't very good, but I
thought australopithecus nailed it.

20:51.911 --> 20:55.414
I'm really more of a
rapper, or "urban poet."

20:55.682 --> 20:57.082
Holla!

20:59.018 --> 21:01.086
- Hey, Fletcher.
- Hey, Chyna.

21:01.921 --> 21:02.921
Wait.

21:08.261 --> 21:10.095
I see what's going on here, Fletcher.

21:10.663 --> 21:12.164
You're trying to make me look...

21:12.765 --> 21:14.999
Way less pretty so no
one else will want me!

21:15.801 --> 21:17.636
Both: What? Come on.

21:18.003 --> 21:20.805
The ridiculous outfit, the
comically oversized necklace,

21:20.906 --> 21:23.941

profession of musician!

21:25.144 --> 21:27.545
No! I'm trying to turn you into Chyna.

21:27.946 --> 21:29.914
I knew you were still in love with her!

21:30.282 --> 21:32.449
(Scoffs) Well, can you blame him?

21:32.918 --> 21:35.086
He's not just going to wake
up one day and get over...

21:35.187 --> 21:38.790
No, she means nothing to me!

21:39.624 --> 21:40.624
Okay, then.

21:42.161 --> 21:43.560
I figured out you were testing me,

21:43.662 --> 21:45.163
so I gave you a taste of your own medicine.

21:45.264 --> 21:47.398
Well, according to the American
college of clinical pharmacology,

21:47.499 --> 21:49.333
you should only ever
taste your own medicine!

21:50.201 --> 21:53.003
Guys! Can't you see this is a good thing?

21:54.172 --> 21:57.007
You never would've done this if
you didn't really like each other.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.909
That's why you got so upset when you,

21:59.010 --> 22:02.112
very understandably, thought
Fletcher was still in love with me.

22:02.413 --> 22:06.149
And you got upset because Olive used
my irresistibility to tempt you.

22:07.618 --> 22:11.654
I see... So what you're saying is,
we shouldn't be mad at each other.

22:11.923 --> 22:13.523
Right. We should be mad at you.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.225
Right... What?

22:16.794 --> 22:17.961
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

22:18.062 --> 22:20.296
You are not putting this on me. Olive: Wow.

22:20.831 --> 22:23.666
Denial, inability to take responsibility...

22:24.401 --> 22:26.436
There's only one way to
work through your issues.

22:31.107 --> 22:33.543
Come on! Don't leave me out here alone!

22:33.644 --> 22:36.745
Angus: Oh... You're not alone! (Growls)

22:43.954 --> 22:45.054
Guys!

22:45.956 --> 22:47.156
Look at this!

22:47.257 --> 22:51.660
The school is making me
go to anger management.

22:51.927 --> 22:53.662
Can you believe this herkie?

22:54.930 --> 22:58.533
Why would anyone think I
need help managing my anger?

22:58.634 --> 23:01.302
That makes me so angry!

23:05.941 --> 23:07.876
(Sighs) Anyway,

23:08.610 --> 23:10.611
I'll see you guys after anger management.

23:13.048 --> 23:18.286
So not only did I lose the stupid
programming competition, but Fletcher...

23:18.387 --> 23:20.989
Fletcher is dating my Olive!

23:23.092 --> 23:26.126
Oh! Oh, oh! And Chyna
wouldn't go out with me!

23:27.729 --> 23:29.963
Or give me a pencil!

23:36.371 --> 23:37.371
(Sighs)

23:38.101 --> 23:40.236
Why didn't anyone
tell me about this club?

23:40.604 --> 23:41.804
It's awesome!
