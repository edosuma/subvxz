WEBVTT

00:01.081 --> 00:05.246
The helicopter was waiting for me,
gunfire going off all around,

00:06.086 --> 00:07.519
but I couldn't leave.

00:07.554 --> 00:10.717
As long as I live, I'll never forget
the faces of those children.

00:10.757 --> 00:12.487
All right, we get it. Darfur's a bummer.

00:12.526 --> 00:15.393
But who wants those images
in their head?

00:19.734 --> 00:23.932
She's amazing.
I can't believe you get to work for her.

00:23.971 --> 00:27.668
What you do sounds a lot more fun,
especially during Fashion Week.

00:27.708 --> 00:32.735
Yeah, well, Fashion Week isn't nearly
as cool as Genocide Week.

00:32.780 --> 00:34.612
Sorry. That came out wrong.

00:34.683 --> 00:38.209
<i>You can read the piece
in this month's New York Review.</i>

00:43.191 --> 00:45.818
Brilliant and depressing.

00:45.860 --> 00:48.159
But mostly brilliant.

00:48.196 --> 00:51.233
Miss Mastronardi has offered
to stay a few minutes

00:51.233 --> 00:53.098
if anyone wants to talk to her.

00:53.135 --> 00:55.330
And no asking for jobs.

00:56.505 --> 00:58.837
Hey, something's been bothering me,
and I'm thinking you can help.

00:58.874 --> 01:00.739
- Is this brown?
- Yes.

01:00.776 --> 01:03.302
Because, you know,
I never had the big 64 crayons

01:03.346 --> 01:07.076
that every other kid had, so I don't
know all the obscure colors, like...

01:07.149 --> 01:09.778
- Brown?
... "mocha" or "mud" or "tree bark"...

01:09.852 --> 01:10.841
Those aren't really colors.

01:10.920 --> 01:11.944
Oh.

01:12.021 --> 01:14.420
Well, leave it to Fashion Girl
to clear that up.

01:14.456 --> 01:18.018
- Oh. No, I'm not Fashion Girl.
- I'm Fashion Girl.

01:18.061 --> 01:19.358
<i>But you work at Mode.</i>

01:19.395 --> 01:22.832
I'm Sports Guy, you're Fashion Girl.
We're known by our magazines.

01:22.866 --> 01:25.333
<i>- Okay...
- What do you do at Mode?</i>

01:26.469 --> 01:30.201
Excuse me. Actually,
I'm an assistant to the Editor-in-Chief,

01:30.240 --> 01:31.639
but I've gotten to do other things,

01:31.675 --> 01:34.165
like sometimes I write a column
for the Web site,

01:34.210 --> 01:36.839
and earlier this year
I got to oversee a cover shoot.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.974
Well, sounds like you're on a great
path to becoming a fashion editor.

01:40.050 --> 01:41.074
Oh.

01:41.151 --> 01:43.142
Thanks. Yeah, but I got into YETI

01:43.220 --> 01:45.120
because I'm interested
in other magazines.

01:45.155 --> 01:48.056
Like, one day I would love to do
what you do.

01:48.092 --> 01:50.151
Then you might want
to get off the fashion track

01:50.194 --> 01:51.856
and get some other experience,

01:51.896 --> 01:55.422
because, right now,
fashion's where you're heading.

01:55.466 --> 01:57.093
Yeah, okay.

01:59.504 --> 02:02.632
So I suggested to Jodie
that anyone who wanted

02:02.674 --> 02:04.971
should pair up with a partner
from another magazine,

02:05.008 --> 02:07.477
and that way, we can get experience
from different places.

02:07.512 --> 02:09.275
Have you not got enough going on
at Fashion Week?

02:09.314 --> 02:11.874
<i>Yeah, but if I get the girl
from The New York Review,</i>

02:11.916 --> 02:13.440
then it would totally be worth it.

02:13.485 --> 02:15.316
- That would be a good fit for you.
- Right?

02:15.386 --> 02:18.822
I mean, I love it here, but I've just never
seen myself being in fashion forever,

02:18.890 --> 02:21.724
and for once, I would like to be
in a place that comes more natural,

02:21.761 --> 02:24.888
and then people would stop
calling me "Fashion Girl. "

02:24.929 --> 02:26.591
Who's calling you Fashion Girl?

02:26.632 --> 02:29.100
This morning you've got
the Donna Karan preview,

02:29.135 --> 02:32.570
followed by brunch with Donna Karan
and then the Donna Karan show.

02:32.604 --> 02:34.835
So I'm gonna go out on a limb
and assume that you're wearing...

02:34.874 --> 02:36.205
Cavalli.

02:39.512 --> 02:42.879
Are you sure? I'm worried
that the Cavalli makes you look

02:42.915 --> 02:45.349
a little too
"Michelle Obama at the mall. "

02:45.384 --> 02:47.375
Remember what we said
about unsolicited opinions?

02:47.453 --> 02:50.753
- Yes, yes, I do. It's just...
- The Cavalli, please.

02:51.792 --> 02:56.491
Have I told you lately
what a remarkable body you have?

02:57.063 --> 02:59.361
You'd never even know
you're about to have a child.

02:59.399 --> 03:02.630
- Get me the damn dress.
- They didn't send it.

03:02.669 --> 03:04.899
What? Well, why not?

03:04.938 --> 03:09.342
Well, since you've been
seeing Connor,

03:09.377 --> 03:11.436
you haven't been working
the circuit as much,

03:11.479 --> 03:16.576
and it's possible that you might have
fallen off their radar.

03:17.585 --> 03:19.883
- That is ridiculous!
- Of course it is.

03:19.921 --> 03:22.980
Wilhelmina Slater is the most
important person at Fashion Week.

03:23.057 --> 03:24.888
A "yes" from me determines style.

03:24.926 --> 03:27.690
Do you remember
micro-buckles of '04?

03:29.430 --> 03:33.662
- No, no, not really.
- Exactly. Because I said "no. "

03:34.368 --> 03:39.363
Now, if the Cavalli was not sent,
it was because of human error.

03:39.408 --> 03:41.398
Don't let it happen again.

03:41.442 --> 03:44.240
Yeah, make sure I'm sitting
near Phillip Lim at Peter Som

03:44.278 --> 03:46.804
and nowhere near Peter Som
at Phillip Lim.

03:46.849 --> 03:50.784
Or is it the other way around?
You'll figure it out. More importantly,

03:50.818 --> 03:54.016
- I really need you to deal with these.
- Okay.

03:54.089 --> 03:57.991
Last year, the mandate was for cuffs
to be peering out from jackets.

03:58.026 --> 04:01.393
At Marc Jacobs' preview last night,
suddenly they're peeking instead.

04:01.430 --> 04:03.421
- Can you believe it?
- Nope, I can't.

04:03.498 --> 04:04.692
I mean, it was humiliating.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.929
I need an eighth of an inch
off all of them, ASAP.

04:06.970 --> 04:08.403
Please, use your discretion.

04:08.438 --> 04:12.032
I'd be mortified
if anyone knew they were mine.

04:12.074 --> 04:13.667
Daniel, do you think

04:13.710 --> 04:16.975
you have any non-fashion-related
assignments for me?

04:17.012 --> 04:20.176
It's Fashion Week
at a fashion magazine, Betty.

04:20.216 --> 04:21.240
Right.

04:21.284 --> 04:23.650
I mean, I do have this press release
you could write.

04:23.686 --> 04:25.210
It's for this designer, Heinrich.

04:25.255 --> 04:27.588
<i>He's a last-minute addition
to the Mode show, but...</i>

04:27.658 --> 04:30.990
I'll take it! Knowing how to write
a press release is useful anywhere.

04:31.027 --> 04:32.824
Okay. I'm ready for Fashion Week.

04:32.862 --> 04:36.321
- Wow. You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.561
Everything I'm wearing hurts.
That's good, right?

04:38.602 --> 04:42.766
Whatever it is you're doing,
it definitely works for me. Shall we?

04:44.575 --> 04:46.475
- Bye.
- Have fun.

04:47.645 --> 04:51.137
Peering? My God, Daniel,
have some self-respect.

04:54.251 --> 04:57.847
Hey, Betty, we're having
a little going-away party for Elena.

04:57.889 --> 05:01.255
Want to say goodbye
before she goes away? It's Betty!

05:01.325 --> 05:03.055
Goodbye, Elena!

05:03.595 --> 05:05.256
Bye, Betty!

05:05.330 --> 05:07.298
We are going to miss her so much.

05:07.365 --> 05:10.801
Okay, all right, we all know
you're very excited she's leaving,

05:10.835 --> 05:13.303
but maybe you could tone it back
just a little bit.

05:13.338 --> 05:17.207
<i>Hey, I'm just happy that papi is better
and he doesn't need a nurse anymore.</i>

05:17.243 --> 05:20.541
Good, 'cause I don't think this means
they're going to stop seeing each other.

05:20.578 --> 05:24.447
Please. Once that kinky
Florence Nightingale fantasy is over,

05:24.483 --> 05:25.677
it's done.

05:25.718 --> 05:28.618
Haven't I asked you not to use
the word "kinky" concerning our father?

05:28.653 --> 05:32.852
<i>Look, I have to go. Oh! Wish me luck
with The New York Review.</i>

05:32.892 --> 05:35.053
<i>- Good luck.
- Bye!</i>

05:36.028 --> 05:39.555
Okay, now I mentioned last week
that we'd be picking partners.

05:39.632 --> 05:42.702
I advise you, choose carefully,

05:42.702 --> 05:46.332
because you will be working
with this person all year.

05:46.373 --> 05:49.569
And if you're like me, you'll hook up,
get married, cheat, divorce

05:49.608 --> 05:53.010
and end up bitter and alone.
But I digress.

05:53.046 --> 05:57.812
Okay, let's pick partners!

05:59.419 --> 06:00.750
- Hi!
- Hey!

06:00.787 --> 06:03.278
I'm so excited
you want to work with me.

06:03.323 --> 06:05.917
Totally.
Not just because of the giant cookie

06:05.959 --> 06:08.359
- you sent to my office.
- Was it good?

06:08.428 --> 06:12.364
All right, is everyone sitting
next to the person they picked?

06:13.601 --> 06:18.731
Now turn to the person
on the other side,

06:18.772 --> 06:21.173
and meet your new partner.

06:21.209 --> 06:24.838
In publishing,
you must expect the unexpected.

06:24.879 --> 06:26.847
I get Fashion Girl!

06:26.881 --> 06:29.543
And I get Sports Guy.

06:29.584 --> 06:31.643
And one last thing,

06:31.686 --> 06:35.589
your assignment this week
is to trail your partner at work.

06:35.624 --> 06:37.454
Come back ready to discuss five things

06:37.492 --> 06:39.289
you learned about
each other's magazines,

06:39.327 --> 06:43.162
and nothing stupid. Class dismissed.

06:43.232 --> 06:48.693
Jodie? I don't mean to question you.
It's just...

06:48.771 --> 06:50.830
See, I already work
at a fashion magazine,

06:50.873 --> 06:54.138
and I was kind of hoping that I could do
something a little more meaningful,

06:54.176 --> 06:58.203
and I don't know what I can learn
working with the Sports Guy.

06:58.247 --> 07:00.772
Who's right behind you.

07:01.784 --> 07:03.446
Awkward.

07:07.056 --> 07:08.148
Oh.

07:08.657 --> 07:10.285
Hey, why don't we just switch partners?

07:10.326 --> 07:12.191
I mean, you don't want to learn
about fashion.

07:12.228 --> 07:15.391
No, I do, and I know that you are
the perfect person to teach me.

07:15.465 --> 07:18.866
We are going to knock this assignment
out of the park!

07:18.902 --> 07:21.462
That's a sports thing.
I'm gonna teach you all about that.

07:21.538 --> 07:23.597
Oh. Ow!

07:25.000 --> 07:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:39.890 --> 07:43.883
Matt, I promise we will get to the tour,
it's just Fashion Week is crazy

07:43.928 --> 07:45.418
and Daniel has, like,
a million messages.

07:45.463 --> 07:49.092
No problem. So, did you always know
that you wanted to work in fashion?

07:49.166 --> 07:51.930
- Nope, not really.
- So, how'd you end up here?

07:52.002 --> 07:54.528
What? I'm sorry,
I was listening to that message.

07:54.606 --> 07:57.369
Oh. Sorry.
You were talking, I thought it was okay.

07:57.408 --> 08:01.243
And I missed it again. That's okay.
I can just do this later.

08:02.114 --> 08:05.810
Oh, Amanda! I have to write
a press release on Heinrich.

08:05.850 --> 08:07.284
What do you know about him?

08:07.319 --> 08:09.879
Never heard of him. He must suck.

08:11.289 --> 08:13.223
Wow, Heinrich. He's great.

08:13.258 --> 08:15.158
- What, you know Heinrich?
- No.

08:15.193 --> 08:17.889
Oh. Because you just acted
like you knew him.

08:17.929 --> 08:20.763
I wasn't expecting the follow-up. Sorry.

08:23.703 --> 08:27.604
Oh, Daniel, you were all over
the papers today.

08:27.639 --> 08:29.198
- Really?
- Yes!

08:30.610 --> 08:35.308
<i>"Looking sensational at Michael Kors
was Mode's Daniel Meade.</i>

08:35.347 --> 08:36.576
"He was accompanied by... "

08:38.851 --> 08:39.943
- What?
- Nothing.

08:39.986 --> 08:43.479
I just remembered I can't read.
It's my own secret shame.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.616
Amanda, what does it say?

08:48.094 --> 08:51.622
"... his new girlfriend-slash-charity case,
a frump with a pulled-back hairstyle

08:51.665 --> 08:54.758
"that even a turn-of-the-century
librarian would deem too severe. "

08:54.834 --> 08:57.395
See, that is not so bad.
They didn't mention her big ears.

08:57.471 --> 09:00.838
Well, that's insane.
Molly looked fantastic.

09:00.908 --> 09:04.173
Ooh. Not according to this one.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.145
"Daniel Meade might
want to see a dermatologist.

09:06.180 --> 09:10.811
"He seemed to have a 5'5"
woman-shaped growth on his arm. "

09:10.852 --> 09:14.480
Okay, now that one's clever.
You've gotta laugh at that.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.718
Hello? Heinrich?

09:19.661 --> 09:21.754
I think the door's open.

09:22.497 --> 09:24.829
All right, I've never done this before.
I'm a little nervous.

09:24.866 --> 09:27.096
So, if you have any questions,
maybe wait till after.

09:27.168 --> 09:28.601
Got it.

09:36.744 --> 09:37.870
Oh!

09:38.681 --> 09:41.650
Is he dead? Sorry. That was a question.

09:46.855 --> 09:51.485
Excuse me? Are you Heinrich?

09:53.295 --> 09:57.356
I am The Heinrich. Heinrich for short.

09:57.399 --> 10:01.302
<i>I'm Betty Suarez from Mode.
This is my colleague, Matt.</i>

10:01.371 --> 10:03.167
I'm going to write your press release.

10:03.239 --> 10:06.834
We will make love. Not today.
But someday.

10:06.909 --> 10:11.540
Okay. Are those your dresses?
They're very nice.

10:12.548 --> 10:16.041
They are garbage!

10:18.688 --> 10:22.920
<i>This is what we will present
at the Mode show.</i>

10:49.320 --> 10:51.880
Wings. They have wings!

10:51.922 --> 10:54.482
I don't know, though.
I kind of like this photo he's given you.

10:54.525 --> 10:56.459
I like the way it catches the light.

10:56.494 --> 10:59.658
That's shards of glass!
The dress is on the mannequin

10:59.698 --> 11:02.222
because the models won't even
sign the release to wear that thing.

11:02.266 --> 11:04.758
Well, who am I to judge anyone?

11:04.803 --> 11:06.794
<i>Two years ago,
I was the "Mode Designer to Watch. "</i>

11:06.872 --> 11:08.931
Now look at me,
knocked up with someone else's kid,

11:09.007 --> 11:12.534
forced to take Brad Pitt's cuffs in
by an eighth of an inch.

11:12.611 --> 11:15.876
So, the Closet is just,
like, a really big closet?

11:15.914 --> 11:16.938
Mmm-hmm.

11:17.015 --> 11:21.042
There is no comparison between
The Heinrich and The Christina.

11:21.086 --> 11:22.280
Well, it's very kind of you to say,

11:22.321 --> 11:25.086
but no one's writing a press release
about me, are they?

11:25.124 --> 11:27.217
So, do they ever give you
any of the clothes?

11:27.260 --> 11:28.659
'Cause if I'm covering a game

11:28.695 --> 11:30.821
and one of the guys
is throwing out a bloody jersey,

11:30.862 --> 11:33.457
sometimes I get to keep that. Score.

11:33.499 --> 11:36.434
That's cool. Hey, Matt,
this is probably so boring for you.

11:36.469 --> 11:38.437
Do you want to go back to my desk
and read back issues?

11:38.471 --> 11:39.938
It's such a good way to learn.

11:39.972 --> 11:41.439
And you can open
my confidential drawer.

11:41.507 --> 11:43.941
Don't worry, it's just snacks.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.276
Well, he seems interesting.

11:49.315 --> 11:52.443
I know, it's just a really bad time
to have somebody following me.

11:52.485 --> 11:55.546
<i>I mean, I was willing to make
the sacrifice for The New York Review,</i>

11:55.589 --> 11:58.820
but sports experience,
that's not really gonna help me.

11:58.859 --> 12:02.295
All right, what am I gonna say
about this thing?

12:02.329 --> 12:05.230
Come here. Here we go.
"For immediate release. "

12:11.372 --> 12:13.135
- You can't write that.
- No, no, no, I can, I can...

12:13.173 --> 12:16.302
- No, right, it's good for a laugh.
- Okay, but this is just for us.

12:21.148 --> 12:26.212
"So get your tetanus shots
and prepare to bleed. "

12:27.756 --> 12:31.317
Here you go.
I changed "shiny" to "glittering"

12:31.359 --> 12:34.453
and added the words
"breakout designer" a few times.

12:34.496 --> 12:36.727
- It's good.
- Thank you so much, Justin.

12:36.766 --> 12:39.199
It was so hard for me
to get anything done at work yesterday

12:39.234 --> 12:40.565
with all of Matt's questions.

12:40.602 --> 12:43.868
<i>Ooh! Before I forget, I only get two
tickets to the Mode show this year,</i>

12:43.906 --> 12:45.271
so we have to decide who's going.

12:45.307 --> 12:49.037
I get one or I tell everyone
that you still like Ricky Martin.

12:49.110 --> 12:50.601
I'm sorry, I have to play hardball.

12:50.679 --> 12:52.704
Mama made pancakes!

12:53.249 --> 12:55.217
Ooh! Someone's in a good mood.

12:55.251 --> 12:58.482
<i>Well, guess who's not taking
papi's blood pressure this morning.</i>

12:58.521 --> 13:00.489
- Nurse Skank.
- Hilda...

13:00.523 --> 13:03.014
Let me enjoy myself.
Eat your pancakes. Look, smiley face.

13:04.161 --> 13:06.288
Chocolate-chip eyes!

13:06.329 --> 13:08.159
- Morning.
- Morning.

13:08.998 --> 13:11.229
You have the same hideous robe
as Grandpa?

13:11.268 --> 13:14.203
It's not hideous. It's retro.

13:14.237 --> 13:17.001
And, obviously,
we have some things to talk about.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.669
I just hope we can be mature about it.

13:22.245 --> 13:24.679
Oh, sure.
I got no problem being mature.

13:24.714 --> 13:26.808
I gotta get to work.
You know, Fashion Week, all of that.

13:26.884 --> 13:28.942
Sorry. Talk to you later.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.789
Okay, I just have to say something.

13:32.824 --> 13:37.123
You're better than that robe,
and I'm gonna go get you one of mine.

13:39.864 --> 13:41.729
<i>And in the
"Ten Designers To Watch" show,</i>

13:41.766 --> 13:45.566
<i>Mode presents
cutting-edge fashion, literally.</i>

13:45.603 --> 13:48.265
Made from barbed wire and rusty nails,

13:48.306 --> 13:52.367
designer Heinrich's line
promises to intrigue and injure.

13:52.410 --> 13:53.468
What?

13:53.511 --> 13:56.208
<i>Science said no, but Heinrich said yes.</i>

13:56.281 --> 13:57.269
No!

13:57.348 --> 13:59.942
<i>So get your tetanus shot
and be prepared to bleed!</i>

14:00.017 --> 14:01.007
<i>Ouch!</i>

14:01.153 --> 14:04.782
Oh, my God,
that's the wrong press release.

14:09.695 --> 14:11.094
Morning!

14:11.129 --> 14:13.654
You would not believe how much
I've already learned about fashion.

14:13.699 --> 14:15.793
I now know that these are chinos.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.563
- Khakis.
- Damn it.

14:17.603 --> 14:23.008
Matt, did you see where I put
that press release I wrote yesterday?

14:23.042 --> 14:24.907
- Yeah, I gave it to your boss.
- You what?

14:24.944 --> 14:26.774
Well, he asked for it,
and it said "For immediate release,"

14:26.812 --> 14:28.109
so I didn't want to wait
until you came back.

14:28.180 --> 14:32.675
No, no, no. That was... That was
just a joke, a mean and terrible joke.

14:32.752 --> 14:33.946
I wrote the real one last night.

14:34.020 --> 14:35.486
That one was never
supposed to go out.

14:35.521 --> 14:38.047
Oh, God. I'm really sorry.

14:38.424 --> 14:39.584
Ooh!

14:42.729 --> 14:44.527
Look, if you get fired,
I can get you a new job.

14:44.565 --> 14:46.532
The guy who covers wrestling
is leaving.

14:46.566 --> 14:47.624
What?

14:47.667 --> 14:51.160
I see it's probably not the best fit,
but we'll figure something...

14:55.808 --> 14:58.505
Daniel, I'm sorry.
This was never supposed to happen.

14:58.546 --> 15:00.912
Peering is back!

15:01.715 --> 15:04.275
- Huh?
- Why did I ever listen to Marc Jacobs?

15:04.351 --> 15:08.287
Lagerfeld laughed in my face
because my cuffs were peeking.

15:08.923 --> 15:10.015
Oh.

15:10.591 --> 15:12.355
Hey, nice job on that press release,
by the way.

15:12.394 --> 15:15.726
I liked that it wasn't full
of the same old clichés,

15:15.763 --> 15:17.754
and so did Heinrich.

15:20.535 --> 15:21.593
Really?

15:21.636 --> 15:24.127
He wants you to produce his show.

15:26.341 --> 15:29.538
Some jumping and hugging
might be appropriate now.

15:29.578 --> 15:33.981
No... Produce his show?
What would I have to do?

15:34.049 --> 15:35.880
You know, come up
with a concept for the show

15:35.951 --> 15:38.476
that gets people excited
about his clothes.

15:38.553 --> 15:39.577
Oh...

15:39.654 --> 15:43.818
I don't know if I'm the right person
for this particular line.

15:43.858 --> 15:47.124
Betty, come on, don't worry,
designers have very clear visions.

15:47.163 --> 15:51.065
Just listen to Heinrich.
He'll tell you exactly what he wants.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.766
Okay, yeah!

15:53.802 --> 15:56.772
All right, well,
then I guess I'm producing a show!

15:58.808 --> 16:00.673
What was that?

16:00.710 --> 16:05.081
It's jumping. It was your idea.

16:05.081 --> 16:08.150
Marc St. James alerting you
that Wilhelmina Slater is en route

16:08.150 --> 16:11.814
to the Proenza Schouler show,
confirming her usual seat.

16:14.457 --> 16:18.394
That's... That's funny.
It's getting less funny.

16:19.329 --> 16:22.264
You cannot do this to me.

16:22.299 --> 16:27.100
Name your price. Box at the Met,
reservations at Buddakan, kidney?

16:27.137 --> 16:28.798
I'm O negative. It's a universal donor.

16:28.839 --> 16:31.104
I can hear you, you know.

16:32.410 --> 16:34.104
What's going on?

16:34.611 --> 16:38.207
You're not going to throw up, are you?
Roll down the window.

16:38.249 --> 16:39.841
You're in the second row.

16:39.884 --> 16:43.614
What? How is that possible?
I'm always in the front row.

16:43.687 --> 16:47.590
I don't know, but they swear
that there's nothing that they can do.

16:47.625 --> 16:50.093
You say the word,
and I will kill myself right now.

16:50.128 --> 16:51.687
Marc, stop!

16:53.464 --> 16:55.125
Well, I'm certainly not going in there.

16:55.166 --> 16:58.398
No! It'd be more humiliating
than being caught in Crocs.

16:58.437 --> 17:02.668
How could this happen?
Have I changed? Have I gone soft?

17:02.707 --> 17:05.472
No, you're still as horrible and evil

17:05.511 --> 17:08.002
as the day that Satan himself
placed you in your mother's arms.

17:08.047 --> 17:09.742
Darling, that's sweet.

17:09.781 --> 17:11.443
But obviously,
the fashion world has forgotten

17:11.483 --> 17:15.282
that I decide who is relevant, not them.

17:15.354 --> 17:18.790
I need to remind them of my power.

17:21.227 --> 17:23.387
I have a surprise for you.

17:24.128 --> 17:27.588
<i>This is Clarissa and Skye,
two Mode stylists.</i>

17:27.634 --> 17:30.068
You never take advantage
of dating an Editor-in-Chief,

17:30.103 --> 17:32.866
so I thought,
"What better time than Fashion Week?"

17:32.905 --> 17:34.066
Thank you.

17:55.830 --> 17:57.422
Say something.

17:58.466 --> 17:59.763
I can't.

18:05.306 --> 18:07.774
Don't mess up my lipstick.

18:14.448 --> 18:18.510
You are the first person
who understands me, Betty Suarez.

18:18.553 --> 18:21.419
Still, we will wait to make love.

18:21.489 --> 18:23.287
Okay, let's talk about your show.

18:23.358 --> 18:25.724
I tell you exactly what I want.

18:25.761 --> 18:30.026
The hot, dry, vortex of wind

18:30.064 --> 18:33.935
that blows dreams into dust.

18:33.935 --> 18:36.096
- Okay, so, fans...
- No, no, no!

18:36.138 --> 18:39.040
- I hate fans. They are cliché.
- No fans.

18:39.542 --> 18:42.942
- Give me gray.
- Gray! That's good. That's specific.

18:42.978 --> 18:45.573
Gray but obscure.

18:46.282 --> 18:53.051
A rainbow of gray,
but sharp, like clear fog.

18:55.291 --> 18:57.316
Heinrich, I think we're going
in the wrong direction...

18:57.393 --> 18:59.588
No, no! Betty, Betty.

18:59.695 --> 19:04.291
<i>It is about pain und escape,</i>

19:04.333 --> 19:07.792
but no escape. Understand?

19:08.872 --> 19:12.638
- Actually...
- No, no... Listen to the clothes.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.644
They will tell you what to do.

19:20.784 --> 19:23.810
I am coming to you live
from the Proenza Schouler show,

19:23.854 --> 19:28.814
and now entering the tent in a fabulous
Marc Jacobs frock, we have...

19:28.892 --> 19:31.759
Looks like somebody's gone
from drab to fab.

19:31.795 --> 19:36.392
<i>Hello? Extreme Makeover,
Face Edition! Ugly duckling?</i>

19:36.768 --> 19:38.632
Ugly duckling?

19:40.470 --> 19:42.462
Maybe I should have gone with "swan. "

19:42.507 --> 19:43.804
Wilhelmina Slater wants to give you

19:43.842 --> 19:46.878
an exclusive review
of the Proenza Schouler line,

19:46.878 --> 19:50.279
and trust me,
she'll be at her Wilhel-meanest.

19:51.916 --> 19:54.282
Hey! Sorry I'm late.
I was stuck talking to Heidi Klum.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.880
That woman cannot find her way
to the end of a joke.

19:56.922 --> 20:00.084
- Actually, I have to go.
- Everything okay?

20:01.259 --> 20:03.626
Yeah. It... My landlord called.

20:03.662 --> 20:07.462
There's a leak in my ceiling
that might cave in, or something,

20:07.498 --> 20:10.957
and it might take a while.
So I'll talk to you later?

20:16.543 --> 20:18.908
Is it telling you what the concept is yet?

20:18.944 --> 20:20.707
No, not yet.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.478
Would it help if I told you I Googled you

20:23.516 --> 20:26.610
and there are already 47 mentions
of you and Heinrich?

20:26.653 --> 20:28.916
No. Actually, that doesn't help at all.

20:28.954 --> 20:30.421
So it's probably not the best time
to ask you

20:30.456 --> 20:33.493
about the clip of you riding a Harley
into a vat of Jell-O.

20:33.493 --> 20:36.563
Okay, Betty, you have got to
get me into the Heinrich show.

20:36.563 --> 20:38.724
He is my favorite designer
in the whole world.

20:38.798 --> 20:41.733
Okay, didn't you say
that you didn't even know who he was?

20:44.304 --> 20:48.900
Someone's been hitting the tequila
again. It's like mother's milk to her.

20:49.776 --> 20:51.836
Betty, Heinrich is all
people are talking about.

20:51.879 --> 20:53.608
So that means he's good. Obvi.

20:53.648 --> 20:56.014
What? Excuse me.

20:56.050 --> 20:59.451
Daniel! Daniel!
Can I talk to you for just one second?

20:59.487 --> 21:02.945
So, like, the buzz on this
Heinrich thing, it's getting kind of big...

21:02.990 --> 21:04.685
Yeah, yeah, actually,
I was just coming to tell you,

21:04.725 --> 21:07.387
we're moving him
to the closing position. Isn't that great?

21:08.529 --> 21:11.327
Wow! Great!
So, like, if you want to go with someone

21:11.399 --> 21:13.459
with a little more experience
to produce his show,

21:13.535 --> 21:15.765
you know, someone who can,
like, hear when clothes talk,

21:15.804 --> 21:17.771
like some sort of a clothes whisperer...

21:17.805 --> 21:19.796
Why are you so weird today?

21:19.840 --> 21:22.275
I just don't think
that I'm the person for this job.

21:22.311 --> 21:26.838
Betty, I trust you more than anyone.
You are gonna do great.

21:30.852 --> 21:33.514
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't get any of this stuff, either.

21:33.555 --> 21:35.921
I mean, aren't you supposed
to be able to wear clothes?

21:35.958 --> 21:37.892
Yep, one would think.

21:37.926 --> 21:40.258
- So, why is he good?
- I don't know,

21:40.295 --> 21:41.627
but apparently there's something there,

21:41.698 --> 21:43.825
because everyone's going crazy
for The Heinrich,

21:43.900 --> 21:45.366
and I don't know what it is!

21:45.434 --> 21:47.664
- Oh. That's not good.
- It's very not good.

21:47.703 --> 21:50.332
You know what else is not good?

21:50.373 --> 21:52.307
I think I've wasted three years of my life

21:52.342 --> 21:55.242
in an industry
that I don't even understand,

21:55.277 --> 21:58.304
and apparently,
it's all I'm qualified to do.

21:58.348 --> 21:59.679
Well, when things get stressful,

21:59.716 --> 22:02.241
sometimes it's good to take a break,
step outside your world.

22:02.285 --> 22:04.879
We can go over to my magazine.
I could teach you about sports.

22:06.055 --> 22:08.819
Great.
Maybe I could find a career in sports.

22:08.858 --> 22:11.191
I mean, I was thinking a magazine
that actually meant something,

22:11.228 --> 22:12.354
<i>you know, like The New York Review.</i>

22:12.396 --> 22:16.331
But, hey, I could have a future
in fashion or sports!

22:16.399 --> 22:17.697
Right.

22:21.905 --> 22:25.204
You know, I was really excited
when we got partnered up.

22:25.242 --> 22:26.675
You know,
I've been listening to you in class,

22:26.710 --> 22:29.144
and you seemed so smart
and interested in things.

22:29.179 --> 22:33.048
But I don't know. You haven't asked me
a single thing about what I do.

22:33.084 --> 22:35.381
It's like you heard "sports"
and judged me,

22:35.419 --> 22:39.413
which is exactly what
you don't want people to do to you.

22:39.457 --> 22:43.052
Now I know
you think fashion is shallow,

22:43.094 --> 22:54.339
but it seems to me like you fit right in.

22:54.339 --> 22:56.330
Matt! Matt!

22:57.409 --> 23:00.846
I'm sorry. Look, you were right.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.042
I was being awful,
and Fashion Week is not an excuse.

23:04.082 --> 23:06.677
And I promise you, I am not shallow.

23:06.719 --> 23:10.621
I know. I know. Even as I was saying it,
I wasn't really believing it.

23:10.656 --> 23:14.717
Good, because I do want to learn about
your magazine. In fact, let's go now.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.091
- Now?
- Yeah!

23:16.128 --> 23:19.962
Daniel's out at the shows, I'm not gonna
get any further on this Heinrich thing,

23:19.999 --> 23:24.060
so let's go learn about sports.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.764
You know, tonight might not
be the best night to start.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.535
I won't take no for an answer.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.506
Oh!

23:35.549 --> 23:37.039
I tried to warn you.

23:37.084 --> 23:39.951
You could've been
a little more specific.

23:40.587 --> 23:41.953
I can't believe you haven't seen

23:41.989 --> 23:43.148
<i>Step Up 2: The Streets yet.</i>

23:43.190 --> 23:46.819
It's only the best classical-versus-urban
dance movie ever.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.421
It totally defines my generation.

23:52.933 --> 23:55.595
Hey! Trying to watch a movie here.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.205
<i>Five, six, seven, eight...</i>

23:59.340 --> 24:02.308
<i>Again, one, two, three, four, five...</i>

24:02.342 --> 24:05.710
- We should go dancing some time.
- I got some moves.

24:06.414 --> 24:08.075
I bet you do.

24:14.489 --> 24:17.459
- Everything okay?
- I can't hear what they're saying.

24:17.493 --> 24:20.929
It's either about "stepping up"
or "the streets. "

24:24.332 --> 24:27.393
You know what?
I don't even like this movie.

24:33.609 --> 24:36.134
What is going on with you?
You're acting like a child.

24:36.211 --> 24:38.270
You're acting like a horny teenager.

24:38.313 --> 24:42.977
Hilda, I'm sorry you don't like this,
but I have a right to be in a relationship.

24:43.018 --> 24:46.477
And I have a right not to have
your relationship shoved in my face

24:46.523 --> 24:47.854
every time I turn around!

24:47.891 --> 24:50.359
<i>No, papi! This is my house, too.</i>

24:53.429 --> 24:55.397
For the record, I really like Elena,

24:55.431 --> 24:59.492
and it's not just because
she's turned this place into a day spa.

25:00.137 --> 25:01.797
I wish Hilda felt that way.

25:01.871 --> 25:04.533
I know. They used to be friends.

25:05.308 --> 25:07.402
Maybe if she stayed in a room with her
more than a minute,

25:07.478 --> 25:09.378
she'd remember that.

25:10.047 --> 25:13.345
Come on.
Andie's about to show the 410 crew

25:13.383 --> 25:16.114
the true meaning of the streets.

25:21.158 --> 25:22.853
Hey, nice game.

25:23.227 --> 25:26.424
Matt, are you sure it's okay
for me to be in here?

25:26.463 --> 25:28.864
Well, they're okay with it if you are.

25:28.900 --> 25:31.936
Yeah, I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be fine?

25:31.936 --> 25:32.994
Oh!

25:33.037 --> 25:36.064
Sorry, sorry. I didn't see anything.

25:36.141 --> 25:38.302
Although I think now
we might be married.

25:38.376 --> 25:41.173
Hey. Hey, Sasha.
Sasha, great game Saturday.

25:41.212 --> 25:43.579
Hey, that, Betty, is Sasha Radovic.

25:43.615 --> 25:46.982
I swear, I once saw him drain a three
from the parking lot.

25:47.018 --> 25:49.509
Well, I understood "parking lot. "

25:52.090 --> 25:56.117
So, it must be nice, huh,
working at your dream magazine?

25:56.963 --> 26:01.194
<i>Great Sport? Hardly.
I always... I always stunk at sports,</i>

26:01.233 --> 26:04.328
and I always thought the pros
were just a bunch of overpaid babies.

26:04.370 --> 26:06.930
- Hey, I heard that.
- Good.

26:09.107 --> 26:12.043
- So, what changed?
- I got to know the guys.

26:12.778 --> 26:16.407
Brock, over there, got into
a car accident when he was 16.

26:16.449 --> 26:17.974
Doctors told him
he would never walk again,

26:18.051 --> 26:21.087
but he had a dream to play basketball.

26:21.087 --> 26:25.422
And... And Jimmy...
Well, okay, Jimmy just likes the money.

26:25.459 --> 26:28.894
But... But Sasha... Just wait, wait.

26:30.830 --> 26:32.458
Look at this.

26:34.234 --> 26:37.795
- Whose names are those?
- His siblings.

26:37.838 --> 26:40.966
He was drafted here last year
when he was 18.

26:41.008 --> 26:43.101
Couldn't speak a word of English,
hardly knew a soul,

26:43.176 --> 26:45.110
because the Serbian government
wouldn't allow his family

26:45.145 --> 26:48.603
to come with him.
And so he plays to support them.

26:48.682 --> 26:51.310
- Wow.
- Want me to keep going?

26:51.351 --> 26:54.048
Not if it includes pointing
to more naked men.

26:55.189 --> 26:58.646
All I'm saying is that none of this
was a natural fit for me,

26:58.725 --> 27:02.492
you know, but I found my way in
by making it personal.

27:04.032 --> 27:07.092
<i>Maybe that would work for you at Mode.</i>

27:07.135 --> 27:08.932
Here, come on,
I want to show you the showers.

27:08.970 --> 27:09.994
Oh.

27:10.038 --> 27:14.065
I'm kidding. We're actually
going to the steam room.

27:14.777 --> 27:16.438
Shut up, Matt.

27:20.214 --> 27:23.810
I spent an hour and a half
trashing Proenza Schouler.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.244
I said the most heinous things.

27:26.288 --> 27:28.756
I'm surprised
I wasn't arrested for a hate crime.

27:28.791 --> 27:31.692
That'll teach them who has
the real power in this business.

27:31.727 --> 27:33.661
Nobody puts Baby in the second row.

27:33.696 --> 27:37.598
Darling, that reference might be current
in Australia, but we're over it here.

27:38.701 --> 27:40.225
This must be it.

27:40.269 --> 27:42.169
<i>And finally, my exclusive interview</i>

27:42.204 --> 27:44.901
<i>with Mode's Co-Editor-in-Chief,
Wilhelmina Slater.</i>

27:44.941 --> 27:48.103
<i>We hear she's got some juicy dish
on Proenza Schouler's new line.</i>

27:48.177 --> 27:52.012
Wait a minute. Breaking news!
This just in.

27:52.048 --> 27:54.608
Doggie jeans are now low-waisted.

27:54.684 --> 27:57.915
That's right, pups,
it's time to ditch those mid-rise denims

27:57.954 --> 28:00.320
<i>or risk looking like last year's bitch.</i>

28:00.357 --> 28:03.622
<i>For more on these hoochie-poochies,
let's go to our canine correspondent.</i>

28:05.363 --> 28:07.728
You can't let that bother you.

28:10.066 --> 28:13.093
- It's slipping away.
- What is?

28:16.039 --> 28:17.529
Never mind.

28:18.376 --> 28:22.142
Hey, hey, hey. Talk to me. What is it?

28:23.047 --> 28:28.576
For 20 years, I killed myself
for my career. I sacrificed everything.

28:28.652 --> 28:34.751
And now, because I dare to flirt with
a personal life, suddenly I'm nothing?

28:39.598 --> 28:43.329
Silly me, I just...
I thought I could have it all.

28:44.136 --> 28:49.733
You can, with me.
Willie, you and I are both fighters,

28:50.475 --> 28:54.105
and the thing about being a fighter
is you don't stop.

28:54.147 --> 28:59.106
If you're down, you look for
an opportunity to claw your way back.

28:59.251 --> 29:04.053
Now, people may not like you for it,
but I do,

29:05.323 --> 29:08.953
and we are in this together.

29:20.406 --> 29:24.365
So I learned all about how you grew up
behind the Iron Curtain,

29:24.410 --> 29:28.744
dreaming of a life on the other side
of the Berlin Wall,

29:28.815 --> 29:30.909
and that you lost your father

29:30.984 --> 29:35.147
when he got caught
trying to escape over the barbed wire.

29:35.188 --> 29:38.258
And so even when the Wall
came down, you still carried that pain,

29:38.258 --> 29:42.285
pain that is always with you,
even in the clothes you make.

29:43.931 --> 29:46.024
Maybe the only way
you can imagine escaping

29:46.066 --> 29:50.401
is by raising giant wings
and letting the wind carry you far away.

29:51.673 --> 29:53.231
Is that right?

30:00.982 --> 30:02.813
Now we will make love.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.148
Well, no. Thank you, though.

30:05.220 --> 30:08.621
Let me show you
how I want to use this in your show.

30:10.725 --> 30:14.491
Ta-da. This is a representation
of the Berlin Wall.

30:15.997 --> 30:17.396
You can explain to the fire marshal

30:17.432 --> 30:19.958
that our Iron Curtain is only blocking
the back two exits.

30:20.002 --> 30:21.469
There are six more exits in the house.

30:21.504 --> 30:25.098
Yeah, sure, right after I ask him
to introduce me to some firemen.

30:25.139 --> 30:26.232
- Everything good?
- Oh!

30:26.275 --> 30:28.266
Steve, we have to move Isaac Mizrahi
to the front row.

30:28.310 --> 30:31.074
There are too many sharp objects
for him to throw another tantrum.

30:31.113 --> 30:32.546
- Yeah, everything's great.
- Good.

30:32.581 --> 30:35.345
Then it'll seem less selfish
if I make this about me.

30:35.384 --> 30:38.410
- Something is going on with Molly.
- What do you mean?

30:38.487 --> 30:42.514
Well, she ran out of Proenza Schouler
and hasn't returned my calls since.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.058
Well, did you do something stupid?

30:44.126 --> 30:48.154
No. Just the opposite. I got her this
big makeover right before the show.

30:48.198 --> 30:50.166
- Daniel, you did something stupid.
- Thanks.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.895
- Thank you.
- Wait, what?

30:51.935 --> 30:55.530
Look, you basically told her that
you weren't okay with the way she is.

30:55.572 --> 30:58.405
No, I... I am okay with her.
I think she's amazing.

30:58.441 --> 31:00.409
Well, then you better find a big way
to tell her that.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.876
Oh! Careful with the razor blades!

31:17.295 --> 31:18.626
What are you doing here?

31:18.663 --> 31:20.563
I've never been to Fashion Week.

31:20.598 --> 31:22.930
I thought it'd be fun
to watch the show together.

31:22.967 --> 31:26.061
- Did my father put you up to this?
- No.

31:26.103 --> 31:27.161
I'm gonna kill him.

31:27.204 --> 31:30.368
And how could he do that to Justin?
You know he was dying to come to this.

31:30.409 --> 31:33.605
Actually, Justin's the one
who gave me his seat.

31:33.644 --> 31:37.809
I guess your father's not the only one
who wants us to get along.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.811
<i>- Molly!
- Hi.</i>

31:44.456 --> 31:47.254
- Hey, I've been calling and calling.
- I know...

31:47.292 --> 31:51.422
No, no, no, wait. I have been an idiot.
You don't need a makeover.

31:51.463 --> 31:53.192
I'm the one who needs to change.

31:53.231 --> 31:56.632
You are so different
from everyone I know,

31:56.668 --> 31:58.227
and you care
about the things that matter.

31:58.271 --> 32:01.467
You won't let me get away
with being shallow and stupid.

32:01.506 --> 32:04.873
When I think about our future,
I'm not scared. It's just...

32:04.910 --> 32:07.072
It's exciting,
and I've never been that guy before.

32:07.113 --> 32:10.207
I don't want you to change.
Molly, I love you.

32:15.388 --> 32:19.051
I love you, too.
It's just been an overwhelming week.

32:19.125 --> 32:22.822
Yeah, no, I get that.
Fashion Week is ridiculous,

32:22.862 --> 32:27.527
and you have all that stuff going on
with your apartment. How's that going?

32:28.202 --> 32:31.329
Actually, it's more serious
than they thought,

32:31.971 --> 32:34.133
but they're working on it.

32:42.016 --> 32:44.450
<i>Now, Heinrich!</i>

32:55.063 --> 32:56.928
Come on, who's gonna wear that?

32:56.965 --> 32:59.195
I got the same one in purple.

33:22.924 --> 33:26.622
Christina! I think it's going really well.

33:26.696 --> 33:30.132
Oh! Mother of God!
Pull up your own nail boots next time.

33:30.166 --> 33:33.567
Perfect! The show is perfect!

33:35.571 --> 33:38.597
Thank you! I give you a dress
to say thank you.

33:38.641 --> 33:39.733
Oh.

33:39.775 --> 33:44.007
Your body will destroy the line.
I give you this instead.

33:45.048 --> 33:47.278
Oh, no. Thank you, Heinrich.

33:49.218 --> 33:50.742
Thank you.

33:51.788 --> 33:52.846
Ow!

33:52.889 --> 33:54.254
Mine... Ow!

33:55.058 --> 33:56.787
That hurts so good.

34:06.504 --> 34:10.768
- Okay. Do you want to get a drink?
- Let's go.

34:15.746 --> 34:18.476
I am this close to throwing a tantrum.

34:21.052 --> 34:25.819
<i>Why is spandex such a Glamour don't?
It's the perfect fabric.</i>

34:25.857 --> 34:27.290
You can dress it up,
you can dress it down.

34:27.324 --> 34:31.762
Right? You put on a red belt,
some chunky jewelry, you're going out.

34:33.297 --> 34:36.266
What do you think about stirrup pants?

34:37.068 --> 34:38.728
- You first.
- I love them.

34:38.770 --> 34:41.001
I know, me, too! I love them!

34:41.639 --> 34:44.108
I do. I can't help it.

34:46.110 --> 34:48.705
- You are so busted.
- What?

34:48.746 --> 34:52.774
You're having a good time with me.
You like me.

34:52.818 --> 34:57.653
Fine, I like you.
It's just this thing about my father.

34:57.689 --> 35:01.056
Look, maybe we could
set some ground rules.

35:01.894 --> 35:03.863
Okay, I'm listening.

35:05.198 --> 35:10.226
Well, Ignacio and I could sit
a little further apart during movie night

35:12.405 --> 35:15.670
and keep the PDA to a minimum.

35:15.708 --> 35:19.303
I don't know, it is kind of sweet,
you guys macking on each other.

35:19.345 --> 35:22.041
But maybe you could go to your place
once in a while.

35:22.081 --> 35:23.378
Done.

35:25.486 --> 35:28.784
That model with the spikes
is a wee bit unsteady on her feet.

35:28.822 --> 35:30.289
I think there might be an impaling.

35:30.323 --> 35:33.987
I think I finally get it. Fashion is art.

35:35.296 --> 35:38.527
It's just another way
of taking what's on the inside

35:38.599 --> 35:42.228
and putting it out there
for everyone else to experience it.

35:42.303 --> 35:47.206
It's not shallow. It's courageous. It's...
It's beautiful.

35:49.910 --> 35:51.970
Are you okay?
Did you cut yourself on a dress again?

35:52.013 --> 35:55.549
No, no, no... Well, no, not that. I just...

35:57.017 --> 35:59.646
- Are you going into labor?
- Not exactly.

35:59.688 --> 36:02.316
- I've sort of been in labor all day.
- What?

36:02.357 --> 36:03.619
No, but I didn't want
to go to the hospital

36:03.658 --> 36:05.852
until the contractions
got a little bit closer together.

36:05.893 --> 36:07.919
- What?
- Which is about now.

36:07.963 --> 36:10.830
Well, come on,
let's get you out of here!

36:12.067 --> 36:15.764
Shoot! The Iron Curtain is
blocking the back two exits.

36:20.576 --> 36:23.511
Heinrich, I'm sorry! Christina, let's go.

36:23.546 --> 36:26.105
No, no, no, Betty. Not the runway.

36:26.147 --> 36:27.911
- Yes, the runway!
- I don't want to spoil the show.

36:27.950 --> 36:29.679
We don't have any other option!

36:29.719 --> 36:33.553
It is more pain than I could
ever dream of! It is perfect!

36:34.490 --> 36:37.186
- Excuse me. Here, just take my hand.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:37.226 --> 36:39.786
Oh, no. No.

36:39.829 --> 36:43.664
Okay, now,
watch out for the broken glass.

36:43.734 --> 36:46.793
- Just keep breathing. Breathe.
- I'm breathing.

36:46.869 --> 36:49.338
Daniel, call an ambulance!

36:49.406 --> 36:53.671
You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna get to a doctor.

36:53.709 --> 36:56.941
Good, good. Oh, no! Oh, no! Christina!

36:56.980 --> 37:01.076
Oh, no! Go ahead, you go without me.
I'll be okay.

37:01.118 --> 37:04.918
- What are you talking about?
- I have no idea. I'm delirious.

37:04.955 --> 37:07.287
But I think
I'm gonna have the baby here!

37:07.324 --> 37:08.552
What?

37:13.864 --> 37:15.024
Excuse me.

37:15.065 --> 37:16.498
Apparently, the back exits are blocked,

37:16.566 --> 37:19.627
which is why Betty and Christina
decided to ruin the show.

37:19.704 --> 37:20.728
Yes, I'll hold.

37:20.805 --> 37:22.932
Paramedics said with the crowds
and street closures,

37:23.006 --> 37:24.031
it could be tough to get through,

37:24.108 --> 37:26.474
but I'm checking on a helicopter
right now. Yes, Daniel Meade.

37:26.511 --> 37:29.139
So Christina can't get out,
and they can't come in.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.978
It's a fashion disaster.

37:31.016 --> 37:36.248
Or it could be an opportunity for me
to claw my way back to the top.

37:38.590 --> 37:41.388
People, she needs her privacy!

37:41.427 --> 37:44.554
Models! Come forward! Let's go!

37:47.566 --> 37:49.500
Now raise your wings!

37:53.038 --> 37:55.905
This isn't quite
how I pictured it happening.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.705
Could the models please turn around?

38:00.647 --> 38:04.138
Is there anyone here qualified
to deliver a baby?

38:05.084 --> 38:07.315
My father's girlfriend is a nurse!

38:07.354 --> 38:09.914
- You called me his girlfriend.
- Yeah, I'm growing.

38:09.956 --> 38:12.116
Chop-chop! Let's go!

38:12.157 --> 38:14.888
Who's the pregnant lady wearing?

38:14.928 --> 38:18.364
Herself! She's wearing herself!
Christina McKinney!

38:18.498 --> 38:19.658
Yay!

38:19.699 --> 38:23.260
That was Isaac Mizrahi!
You're gonna get really excited later.

38:23.336 --> 38:24.735
Yes, yes...

38:24.771 --> 38:28.208
Stand by lights. Cue music.

38:28.242 --> 38:30.608
<i>This is Suzuki St. Pierre
live from the Mode show,</i>

38:30.644 --> 38:33.077
where the child of Wilhelmina Slater
and the late Bradford Meade

38:33.113 --> 38:35.309
is about to make its
first runway appearance.

38:35.349 --> 38:36.816
With any luck,
Wilhelmina's chromosomes

38:36.851 --> 38:39.786
will drown Bradford's in the gene pool,
and we'll end up with a looker.

38:41.521 --> 38:44.389
Oh, God,
I wish she would quit doing that.

38:58.173 --> 39:03.406
I am not crying. I am not...
Damn it. It's Dan Rather all over again.

39:03.445 --> 39:07.108
Go lights. Go music.
Cue the hydraulic lift.

39:21.029 --> 39:22.860
Cue the land mines!

39:34.310 --> 39:37.473
Matt! Hey! What are you doing here?

39:37.513 --> 39:42.280
Well, I wanted to see what you did with
the show. And wow! And a live birth!

39:42.318 --> 39:43.615
Yeah.

39:43.653 --> 39:47.146
Heinrich gave you nothing,
and you made it amazing.

39:47.191 --> 39:49.624
Yeah, well, I mean, you were the one

39:49.659 --> 39:53.391
who told me to dig deeper,
find my connection.

39:53.430 --> 39:55.694
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

39:55.732 --> 39:57.165
For what?

39:57.201 --> 40:01.865
I don't know. It's just an impulse I have
whenever someone says thank you.

40:03.107 --> 40:07.442
So, Matt,
we're going to be partners this year.

40:07.479 --> 40:09.878
I get to learn all about sports,

40:09.913 --> 40:13.178
and now that the fashion show is done,
I'll have time to show you all the things

40:13.217 --> 40:15.812
you wanted to learn about fashion.

40:16.654 --> 40:20.646
To be honest, I wasn't really that
interested in learning about fashion.

40:20.691 --> 40:22.592
I was more interested
in learning about you.

40:22.627 --> 40:23.753
Oh.

40:27.265 --> 40:28.562
So...

40:30.735 --> 40:33.499
I will see you at YETI, partner.

40:37.276 --> 40:41.143
Would've been so much better
if I'd left before I did that.

40:49.622 --> 40:50.953
Okay.

40:57.564 --> 41:01.294
So, what's it feel like
to have a half-brother?

41:02.601 --> 41:04.570
It's good. Weird.

41:05.839 --> 41:08.739
- It makes me miss my dad.
- Yeah.

41:10.609 --> 41:14.444
I didn't get a chance to tell you,
you put on quite a show.

41:15.882 --> 41:19.249
You found a way to make
unwearable clothes beautiful.

41:19.286 --> 41:22.653
Oh, stop. I learned from the best.

41:22.689 --> 41:25.750
Seriously, you have this way
of connecting with people.

41:25.793 --> 41:29.922
Like, you get beneath the surface.
You don't find that in this business.

41:29.963 --> 41:33.000
I know it's not what you want
to be doing,

41:33.000 --> 41:37.299
<i>but I think you'd make a great editor
at Mode someday.</i>

41:37.337 --> 41:40.671
Well, thank you for the compliment.

41:40.708 --> 41:44.610
I'm just kind of embarrassed
it took me so long to figure it out.

41:44.679 --> 41:48.012
Fashion has a lot more substance
than I thought.

41:48.049 --> 41:52.145
Well, I'm certainly glad you think so.

41:52.186 --> 41:53.620
Me, too.

41:54.957 --> 41:58.255
Of course, if you ever decide
to have a career in fashion,

41:58.292 --> 42:01.319
we do have to talk about
all the colors and patterns.

42:01.363 --> 42:03.763
If I decide to have a career in fashion,

42:03.799 --> 42:05.858
then I get to decide what looks good.

42:07.001 --> 42:09.664
And if you don't watch it,
I'll make you wear Heinrich's hat.
