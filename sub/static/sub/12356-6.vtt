MALCOLM:
<i>Maybe if you didn't take the</i>
<i>fall for your baby mama Jeannie</i>

00:09.098 --> 00:11.259
<i>things would've turned out</i>
<i>a little differently, Marty.</i>

00:12.018 --> 00:13.717
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:13.769 --> 00:15.269
MARTY:
<i>I know you're upset about</i>

00:15.304 --> 00:17.388
<i>everything that happened</i>
<i>last year.</i>

00:17.440 --> 00:19.356
We're all good, Marty. You don't
have to worry about me.

00:19.392 --> 00:20.891
I feel like there's
something special here.

00:20.943 --> 00:21.976
We should really see
where it goes...

00:21.978 --> 00:23.644
No!

00:23.861 --> 00:24.982
MARTY:
<i>With this Gage account</i>

00:24.995 --> 00:26.078
<i>coming in, all this attention,</i>

00:26.113 --> 00:27.529
<i>we're gonna be fucking huge.</i>

00:27.531 --> 00:29.581
If anyone's ass here deserves
to be kissed, it's mine!

00:29.617 --> 00:31.450
JEANNIE: <i> There is a crisis</i>
<i>of confidence at Gage.</i>

00:31.502 --> 00:32.918
Maya is the solution.

00:32.953 --> 00:34.837
MARTY:
<i>We just need to keep Maya happy</i>

00:34.872 --> 00:36.505
<i>until those merger papers</i>
<i>are signed.</i>

00:36.540 --> 00:38.173
MAYA:
<i>Ellis is the king of making</i>

00:38.209 --> 00:39.842
<i>grandiose promises,</i>

00:39.877 --> 00:41.043
and never following through.

00:41.045 --> 00:42.961
Big oil magnates
in the Bay Area?

00:43.013 --> 00:44.129
Cal Manchester.

00:44.181 --> 00:45.597
Yee-haw!

00:45.633 --> 00:46.882
How does a merger help me?

00:46.884 --> 00:48.433
Well, it doesn't.

00:48.469 --> 00:50.435
Unless, of course,
producing an electric car

00:50.471 --> 00:53.639
for the masses isn't
a part of Ellis's vision.

00:53.691 --> 00:56.441
I wouldn't worry too much
about motherhood changing you.

00:56.477 --> 00:59.895
People like you don't change.

Pop, are you serious right now?

01:17.548 --> 01:20.082
You're going
half the speed limit.

01:20.084 --> 01:23.051
Are you in a rush?

01:23.087 --> 01:25.420
Yeah, I didn't think so.

01:26.757 --> 01:29.808
You know, you got a captive
audience back there.

01:29.843 --> 01:33.595
I mean, he's putting on
a brave face, but, uh,

01:33.647 --> 01:36.148
he's really freaking
out about today.

01:42.406 --> 01:43.689
Hey...

01:45.409 --> 01:47.859
(groans)
What?

01:47.912 --> 01:48.994
You want to talk about this?

01:49.029 --> 01:50.996
About what, Dad?
Look,

01:51.031 --> 01:52.414
you guys are driving me
to prison right now.

01:52.449 --> 01:54.533
It's gonna be the last...
normal interaction

01:54.585 --> 01:56.718
we're gonna have
for about six months.

01:56.754 --> 01:58.086
Yup.

01:58.122 --> 02:00.372
Do you want to ask anything?

02:00.424 --> 02:03.875
Yeah. Grandpa, how much
longer is the drive?

02:03.928 --> 02:06.461
All my friends are hanging out
at Tom-Tom's birthday.

02:06.463 --> 02:08.630
Yeah, well,
it's Tom-Tom's birthday.

02:08.632 --> 02:10.264
Let's just turn the car around.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.633
All right, all right.
Let's go to Tom-Tom's.

02:11.635 --> 02:13.101
No prison.
All right, all right.

02:13.137 --> 02:14.303
We're going to Tom-Tom's.
Listen, we got to, we got to,

02:14.355 --> 02:16.888
we got to make the
most of this time.

02:16.941 --> 02:18.807
Now, come on.
It's good that you guys

02:18.809 --> 02:21.443
talk like this, because, well,

02:21.478 --> 02:22.861
there's-there's no...

02:22.896 --> 02:25.530
no rulebook as to how
to feel, you know?

02:25.566 --> 02:27.783
Well, it feels like shit.
Yeah.

02:27.818 --> 02:28.951
I mean... all my friends

02:28.986 --> 02:30.485
are at Six Flags, wondering

02:30.487 --> 02:33.322
where I am.

02:33.324 --> 02:34.373
(Roscoe sighs intensely)

02:34.408 --> 02:35.874
This sucks.

02:35.909 --> 02:36.992
Oh, okay.

02:37.044 --> 02:38.910
I thought he meant about me.

02:38.963 --> 02:40.045
Yeah, yeah.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.413
I guess you're right, man.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.230
where are the black voices?

02:58.265 --> 03:00.585
CHANTELLE: Sounds to me like
someone's about to get famous.

03:00.601 --> 03:03.819
No, honestly,
it's not about the fame.

03:03.854 --> 03:05.103
Right. Oh.
I'm...

03:05.155 --> 03:07.239
I'm just trying to

03:07.274 --> 03:10.993
you know, create some
dialogue with my, uh, story.

03:11.028 --> 03:13.161
So you think the people
need your story

03:13.197 --> 03:16.498
to bring them enlightenment
with their morning coffee.

03:16.533 --> 03:18.617
Wow. So you-you the new sugar?

03:18.669 --> 03:19.868
I guess I am.

03:19.870 --> 03:20.869
Well, you know what, brother?

03:20.871 --> 03:22.087
I like mines black.

03:22.122 --> 03:24.456
Oh, shit.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.141
Hell, yeah. I love that.

03:26.176 --> 03:28.293
Marty, that's the perfect
tag line for <i> Blacktalk.</i>

03:28.345 --> 03:29.795

You're welcome.
JEREMIAH: Good morning.

03:31.632 --> 03:34.016
Hi.
Hey, good morning.

03:34.051 --> 03:35.183
Hey, I'm gonna go get Roscoe up.

03:35.219 --> 03:37.969
Uh, well, he's...
Roscoe! Roscoe!

03:38.022 --> 03:39.271
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

03:39.306 --> 03:42.107
MARTY:
Oh, y'all got jokes.

03:42.142 --> 03:43.058
(laughing)

03:43.060 --> 03:46.194
Cute.
Slept over at Jeremy's.

03:46.230 --> 03:48.230
Oh. Okay.
You even know

03:48.232 --> 03:49.531
who Jeremy is, man?

03:49.566 --> 03:52.034
Yeah.
I even know who Jeremy is.

03:52.069 --> 03:54.619
Really? I mean, 'cause
you're so preoccupied

03:54.655 --> 03:56.621
with your work, is all.
Well, you seem

03:56.657 --> 03:59.541
very preoccupied with
being here all of a sudden.

03:59.576 --> 04:02.127
You know, fact is, Marty,

04:02.162 --> 04:05.080
your work and the mighty dollar

04:05.132 --> 04:06.412
are what landed
your ass in jail.

04:06.417 --> 04:08.050
And now you're out, you're
all about that life again.

04:08.085 --> 04:09.084
Mm!

04:09.086 --> 04:09.918
Like it's your drug.

04:09.970 --> 04:11.002
Ooh.

04:11.055 --> 04:12.254
Yeah.
And who gives a shit

04:12.306 --> 04:13.422
where Roscoe's sleeping at,

04:13.474 --> 04:15.090
because you're too busy
out there getting high.

04:15.142 --> 04:16.892
Wow.
Yeah!

04:16.927 --> 04:18.894
I mean, thank you for
your spot-on armchair

04:18.928 --> 04:20.428
psychoanalysis.
It's okay, it's okay.

04:20.481 --> 04:21.930
My pleasure.
No, no, I appreciate it, especially since

04:21.932 --> 04:23.398
you've decided to make
a brief appearance

04:23.434 --> 04:26.017
in all of our lives once again.

04:26.070 --> 04:27.519
Dad, got anything to add?

04:27.571 --> 04:30.105
No, I'm not touching
any of this.

04:30.157 --> 04:33.108
How about we just have
a nice breakfast?

04:33.110 --> 04:35.277
How about everyone
puts on a shirt?

04:35.279 --> 04:36.278
What's wrong with this?

04:36.330 --> 04:37.529
This is okay.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.247
Oh, these pancakes
look like a winner.

04:39.283 --> 04:41.116
Woman, you can't lose.
Damn.

04:41.168 --> 04:43.285
Oh, my God, Malcolm,
you do know that

04:43.287 --> 04:44.953
that's Dad's girlfriend, right?

04:44.955 --> 04:46.955
His? Girl? You?

04:47.007 --> 04:50.125
Oh, my God.
(chuckles)

04:50.127 --> 04:52.294
(quietly): I'm sorry,
is that food

04:52.346 --> 04:53.795
from the kitchen?
Yeah.

04:53.847 --> 04:56.264
Are you re-gifting them
their own salmon

04:56.300 --> 04:57.632
for <i> our</i> presentation?

04:57.634 --> 04:59.768
Could you please keep it down?
Do not narc me out.

04:59.803 --> 05:01.636
This is the best meal
I've had in six weeks.

05:01.638 --> 05:03.305
What are you, homeless?
I'm hungry.

05:03.307 --> 05:04.556
Aw, yeesh.

05:04.608 --> 05:05.774
So, the model for monetizing

05:05.809 --> 05:07.476
can be ad-based,
subscriber-based

05:07.478 --> 05:09.311
or fee enrollment, and while

05:09.313 --> 05:11.279
the desire for the
"Yo Where's The Party?" app

05:11.315 --> 05:13.231
is strong enough
to charge a fee,

05:13.283 --> 05:15.650
it's really the free apps
that get the highest valuation.

05:15.702 --> 05:17.819
Mm. Snapchat's a great
example of this.

05:17.871 --> 05:19.121
Well, Snapchat made
dick in profits.

05:19.156 --> 05:20.989
Yeah, but it was
bid on for billions.

05:20.991 --> 05:22.290
JEANNIE:
The point is to offer

05:22.326 --> 05:24.042
a free version with ads,

05:24.077 --> 05:26.411
and then roll out an option
to upgrade for a fee.

05:26.463 --> 05:28.130
Then you can...
Brah, is that new ink?

05:28.165 --> 05:32.244
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Check it out.
Oh, take it off. Take it all off.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.136
DOUG:
Oh!

05:34.171 --> 05:35.470
Obvi, that is dope.
Yeah.

05:35.506 --> 05:36.671
Yeah, super obvi, Doug.

05:36.723 --> 05:38.974
Guys, can we not
do this right now, please?

05:39.009 --> 05:40.850
Brah, that's a chick tat.
It's not a chick tat.

05:40.894 --> 05:42.344
Well, the writing
is kind of swirly.

05:43.514 --> 05:45.313
You want to see bad-ass?
Yeah. What do you got?

05:45.349 --> 05:46.932
Oh, are we doing scenes
from <i> Magic Mike</i> now?

05:46.984 --> 05:49.151
I got this kiting
in the Dominican.

05:49.186 --> 05:50.485
Oh, nice!

05:50.521 --> 05:51.653
Like, 21...

05:51.688 --> 05:53.989
and it's on fire,
which means, you know,

05:54.024 --> 05:55.190
cards... couple
cards on fire.

05:55.242 --> 05:57.492
Almost a sentence.
Dude, I think you have a grammar

05:57.528 --> 05:59.194
mistake in permanent ink.

05:59.196 --> 06:00.695
Shut up.
JEANNIE: Hey!

06:00.747 --> 06:03.331
Kids? I am about to tell you
TYLER: Oh, that's so crazy.

06:03.367 --> 06:04.783
Oh, my God.
overachievers how you can make

06:04.835 --> 06:07.202
Zuckerberg-level
bank before you're 25,

06:07.254 --> 06:08.954
so pay attention, okay?

06:09.006 --> 06:10.622
Like I don't know what monetizing means.
Right.

06:10.674 --> 06:11.873
JEANNIE: We have
prepared statistical

06:11.925 --> 06:12.874
analysis... that...

06:12.926 --> 06:14.009
Oh, hey, check
this out, down low.

06:14.044 --> 06:15.126
You got to see this.

06:15.179 --> 06:17.179
If you do not
pay attention right now,

06:17.214 --> 06:20.799
I will not hesitate
to flash you my giant, veiny,

06:20.851 --> 06:22.717
naked pregnancy belly button.

06:22.719 --> 06:24.469
This just got
interesting. (chuckling)

06:24.521 --> 06:26.054
Naked.
I like the way that sounds.

06:28.225 --> 06:29.724
That was meant to be a threat,

06:29.726 --> 06:32.727
but if you pay attention,

06:32.729 --> 06:36.648
- how about we can
have it as a reward? - Ugh.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.233
BENJIE: Sweet.

06:38.235 --> 06:40.402

Hey, Roscoe.

Hey.

07:02.259 --> 07:03.808
Uh, Molly.

07:03.844 --> 07:05.594
I bought one of your purses.

07:05.646 --> 07:08.013
Oh, right-- didn't you buy
the-the Chloe satchel, right?

07:08.065 --> 07:09.514
Nice piece. It's timeless.

07:09.566 --> 07:13.101
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about you since then.

07:13.153 --> 07:16.605
Like, a lot.
All the time.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.190
You got any Kate Spade bags?

07:19.243 --> 07:21.693
Seriously? Kate Spade.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.445

Get out of my face.

07:24.948 --> 07:27.115
Mm. Thanks, man.

07:27.167 --> 07:28.783
Actually, you know what?
Give me another one of those.

07:28.785 --> 07:30.752
Thanks. Try this out.

07:32.122 --> 07:33.755
So...

07:33.790 --> 07:36.124
how you been?

08:00.117 --> 08:02.400
Here's a fun little fact:
The word "fortune"

08:02.452 --> 08:04.703
comes from
the Latin word <i> Fortuna,</i>

08:04.738 --> 08:06.538
goddess of chance.

08:06.573 --> 08:09.124
<i>Fortuna--</i> so pretty, right?

08:09.159 --> 08:10.992
Thing is, real fortune

08:11.044 --> 08:13.795
has nothing to do with chance.
Or luck.

08:13.830 --> 08:15.664
<i>Fortuna</i> is bullshit.

08:15.666 --> 08:18.667
Real fortune is calculated.

08:18.669 --> 08:19.718
It's relentless.

08:19.753 --> 08:21.336
Fucking criminal, even.

08:21.338 --> 08:24.339
You have to make fortune happen.

08:24.341 --> 08:26.925
See, when Ellis Hightower
was the new Royal Highness

08:26.977 --> 08:28.393
of the electric car,

08:28.428 --> 08:30.395
his stock took way off.

08:31.682 --> 08:34.566
Then someone forgot
to pay his income taxes

08:34.601 --> 08:36.900
and had to move to a cozy
little room upstate,

08:36.937 --> 08:40.355
and that stock price
went way down here.

08:40.357 --> 08:42.573
Then yours truly came on board,

08:42.609 --> 08:44.241
worked his Marty Kaan magic,

08:44.277 --> 08:47.112
got that old Gage
brain trust back together,

08:47.164 --> 08:48.947
and now that stock price

08:48.999 --> 08:50.498
is all the way up here.

08:50.534 --> 08:51.499
(cash register dings)

08:51.535 --> 08:53.952
And, if you look very closely

08:54.004 --> 08:56.004
at our Gage contra...

08:57.424 --> 08:59.290
...at our Gage contract,

08:59.343 --> 09:01.543
there is a little prize buried

09:01.595 --> 09:03.678
in the bottom of that
Cracker Jack box.

09:03.714 --> 09:05.714
There, in the fine print,
it clearly states

09:05.716 --> 09:08.967
that if the Gage stock price
reaches $200 per share

09:09.019 --> 09:12.103
before our payday,
we will be on the receiving end

09:12.139 --> 09:15.223
of a $9.2 million bonus.

09:15.225 --> 09:16.358
Holy shit.

09:16.393 --> 09:19.361
We just have to <i> squeak</i> it up...

09:19.396 --> 09:20.362
to here.

09:20.397 --> 09:21.646
(cash register dings)

09:21.698 --> 09:22.814
We are about to hit

09:22.866 --> 09:24.616
the fortune motherfucklode.

09:24.651 --> 09:25.950
And then...

09:25.986 --> 09:29.654
I will park wherever
I goddamn well please.

09:32.075 --> 09:33.541
TYLER: Is anyone else
craving nachos?

09:33.577 --> 09:34.576
Where's our nacho guy?

09:34.578 --> 09:36.294
That was next level, just now.

09:36.329 --> 09:37.462
Thanks.

09:37.497 --> 09:38.713
That's what
you're paying us for.

09:38.749 --> 09:40.632
Yeah, these guys are just...

09:40.667 --> 09:42.250
They like to act
all bad-ass,

09:42.252 --> 09:43.251
but their mommies
still give them

09:43.303 --> 09:44.586
Fruit Roll-Ups
in the morning.

09:44.588 --> 09:46.254
All the shit falls on me.

09:46.306 --> 09:48.423
I really need someone
like you to help us.

09:48.475 --> 09:49.758
A... a grown-up.

09:49.810 --> 09:51.059
Well, you have me.

09:51.094 --> 09:52.060
I'm here anytime.

09:52.095 --> 09:54.062
No. What I'm
asking you--

09:54.097 --> 09:55.597
badly, I guess--

09:55.599 --> 09:57.432
is if you'll come on board.

09:57.434 --> 09:58.767
Be our CFO.

09:58.769 --> 10:01.069
The VC who funded us

10:01.104 --> 10:02.737
put a line for it in the budget,

10:02.773 --> 10:04.072
but these guys have ignored it.

10:04.107 --> 10:06.908
It's actually pretty rich pay.

10:06.943 --> 10:07.909
I'm flattered.

10:07.944 --> 10:08.910
Um... (clears throat)

10:08.945 --> 10:09.911
...but I have a job.

10:09.946 --> 10:11.746
I know, you have a huge job.

10:11.782 --> 10:14.282
But you keep telling us
that we're going to be giant.

10:14.284 --> 10:15.533
So take us there.

10:15.585 --> 10:16.951
BENJIE: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Check it out.

10:17.003 --> 10:18.620
The Einsteins
have already agreed.

10:18.672 --> 10:20.588
Just... consider it.

10:20.624 --> 10:23.458
I'm dying.

10:25.345 --> 10:26.795
Whoa.
Snap!

10:27.964 --> 10:28.930
Hey, buddy.

10:28.965 --> 10:30.465
Um...

10:30.467 --> 10:32.217
I'll think about it.

10:32.269 --> 10:33.968
It's not going up, Marty.

10:34.004 --> 10:36.221
Uh, they have pills for that.

10:36.273 --> 10:37.889
You know, it is so brave of you
to talk about it.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.307
Usually, guys who can't get
erections don't want to say...

10:39.309 --> 10:41.059
Trust me,
I get plenty of erections.

10:41.111 --> 10:42.977
See, I think
you're overcompensating now.

10:42.979 --> 10:44.863
Am I the only one who cares
about the Gage stock price?

10:44.898 --> 10:46.815
Jeannie Bean.
Here we go. (Sighs)

10:46.817 --> 10:48.483
Listen, Doug, don't worry
your pretty little head.

10:48.485 --> 10:50.652
By the end of business,
we are gonna hit that number.

10:50.704 --> 10:52.403
Oh, I wish I had
your confidence,

10:52.456 --> 10:53.738
but I feel an ulcer forming.

10:53.790 --> 10:54.739
I do. I can't
handle the waiting.

10:54.791 --> 10:55.740
I just can't!

10:55.792 --> 10:57.125
I can't either.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.910
That's why we're not going to.

10:58.962 --> 11:00.712
I like where this is headed.

11:00.747 --> 11:01.746
Slick back your hair...

11:01.798 --> 11:02.747
Ah.
Okay.

11:02.799 --> 11:04.499
...splash on some cologne,

11:04.501 --> 11:05.750
because we

11:05.802 --> 11:07.669
have a date
with that Gage stock price.

11:07.671 --> 11:09.337
We're gonna throw on
some John Legend,

11:09.389 --> 11:12.173
gently coax its legs open,

11:12.175 --> 11:13.341
and then ram it
all the way home!

11:13.343 --> 11:15.260
Sweet rape metaphor.

11:15.312 --> 11:16.845
Don't go all soft on me,
blondie.

11:16.847 --> 11:19.314
Never. Let's go rape
the shit out of this stock.

11:19.349 --> 11:21.266
It is go time.

11:21.318 --> 11:22.267
DOUG:
Hyah!

11:22.319 --> 11:23.318
Baby bump.

11:23.353 --> 11:24.686
All right.
Oh, see?

11:24.738 --> 11:26.905
I told you I get erections.
Get out of my office, Doug.

11:26.940 --> 11:28.556
You mean, the baby
getting you hard?

11:31.695 --> 11:34.996
MAN: Hang on.
My secretary just walked in.

11:35.031 --> 11:36.164
What?

11:36.199 --> 11:37.415
I know you're very busy,

11:37.450 --> 11:38.666
but something's come up,

11:38.702 --> 11:41.169
and I'm not quite sure
what to do about it.

11:41.204 --> 11:42.871
I know that it's your job
to make big...

11:42.873 --> 11:44.839
very big investment decisions.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.759
But I don't know what the rules
are about secrets I may know

11:47.794 --> 11:49.844
about a company
through my brother-in-law.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.212
But since you're my boss,

11:51.214 --> 11:53.681
and it's technically my job
to help <i> you,</i>

11:53.717 --> 11:56.267
should I tell you something
if I think it can...

11:56.303 --> 11:58.887
help you?

12:00.190 --> 12:02.190
He'll be right with you.

12:10.066 --> 12:12.233
(sighs)

12:17.240 --> 12:19.574
Now, Doug.

12:19.576 --> 12:21.576
Now.

12:22.579 --> 12:24.412
(elevator bell dings)

12:24.414 --> 12:26.247
Oh. Excuse me. Sorry.

12:27.918 --> 12:28.967
(whispering):
There we are...

12:29.002 --> 12:30.001
Uh...

12:31.555 --> 12:33.838
God, I'm so, so sorry.

12:33.890 --> 12:35.323
JEANNIE:
<i>Yeah, well,</i>

12:35.358 --> 12:37.508
this cease-fire between
Gage and Compass Oil

12:37.561 --> 12:39.761
is already skyrocketing
their stock, and...

12:39.813 --> 12:42.146
I have intel that
the city is about

12:42.182 --> 12:45.066
to announce favored parking
privileges for electric,

12:45.101 --> 12:48.987
so that's totally gonna
tip the scales in Gage's...

12:49.022 --> 12:51.105
Um, I gotta go.

12:51.107 --> 12:53.992
It... just not a good time.

12:54.027 --> 12:55.443
(wry laugh)

12:55.445 --> 12:56.444
Hi, Norm.

12:56.446 --> 12:57.996
It's been a while.

12:58.031 --> 12:59.998
Nice to see you, Jeannie.

13:00.033 --> 13:02.033
(wry laugh)

13:06.373 --> 13:07.622
MAN:
<i>Mmm.</i>

13:07.624 --> 13:11.676
This place has the best
carpaccio outside of Italy.

13:11.711 --> 13:13.761
That why you got three orders of it?
Yuck.

13:13.797 --> 13:14.963
Anyway, listen,

13:15.015 --> 13:16.598
we have some intel

13:16.633 --> 13:19.267
for your blog-consuming,
sycophants' entertainment.

13:19.302 --> 13:20.802
You're gonna love it.
Maybe the headline

13:20.854 --> 13:23.187
could read something like:

13:23.223 --> 13:25.356
"Big Oil Concedes Defeat
to Electric Technology."

13:25.392 --> 13:26.975
But I just made that up.
I don't know.

13:27.027 --> 13:28.026
That's too many words.

13:28.061 --> 13:29.310
Yeah, okay.
I got a shorter pitch.

13:29.312 --> 13:30.478
"Electric Cars

13:30.480 --> 13:32.313
Tell Big Oil to Go Suck It."

13:32.315 --> 13:33.781
Now, that's even more words.

13:33.817 --> 13:34.949
Are you sure?
Yeah. Look,

13:34.985 --> 13:36.067
I don't see the big deal.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.151
Cal Manchester

13:37.203 --> 13:38.820
knows how to schmooze.

13:38.872 --> 13:42.206
I'm not gonna do your bidding,
all right?

13:42.242 --> 13:44.792
My followers count
on me for real scoops,

13:44.828 --> 13:47.495
not desperate PR.
Yeah.

13:47.497 --> 13:49.797
Well, we know you love
spooning with big oil,

13:49.833 --> 13:52.667
feeling that half-chub just
rubbing up against your back.

13:52.719 --> 13:54.836
(laughs)
But I think it's time
to switch it up, brother.

13:54.838 --> 13:56.004
We're gonna make it
worth your while.

13:56.006 --> 13:57.922
Oh, you don't have
that kind of scratch.

13:57.974 --> 13:59.841
CLYDE: Oh...
I have a reputation.

14:00.844 --> 14:02.510
Well...

14:02.512 --> 14:03.678
we gave it a shot, right?

14:03.680 --> 14:05.513
We came here
hoping this would work out.

14:05.515 --> 14:07.065
Well, appreciate your time.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.683
(camera shutter clicking)

14:08.685 --> 14:10.852
Whoa!
Whoa, what's that, hmm?

14:10.854 --> 14:12.520
That-that's for <i> my</i> blog.

14:12.522 --> 14:13.988
Fat Fucks Making Backroom

14:14.024 --> 14:15.073
Deals with

14:15.108 --> 14:16.407
Ex-con Businessmen

14:16.443 --> 14:18.493
dot-edu.
Edu-- it's an educational Web site.

14:18.528 --> 14:20.077
It's a place where you go to learn stuff.
Okay. Cool.

14:20.197 --> 14:21.770
Oh, no, no.
I'm not making a deal with you.

14:21.781 --> 14:24.365
Yet, we have this photograph...

14:24.367 --> 14:25.833
You see your silly face in it?

14:25.869 --> 14:27.251
It's right there.

14:27.287 --> 14:28.870
So, maybe you did.

14:32.258 --> 14:34.709
All right, I'll drop
a blind item after lunch.

14:34.761 --> 14:35.495
Oh.
What's he dropping?

14:35.615 --> 14:38.429
He's gonna drop a blind item after lunch.
Hallelujah!

14:38.465 --> 14:40.181
More raw cow for everybody!

14:40.216 --> 14:41.516
CLYDE:
Ugh! God, dude.

14:41.551 --> 14:43.051
Uch!

14:43.053 --> 14:45.173
(overlapping, indistinct
conversations; music playing)

14:50.810 --> 14:52.393
Whoa!

14:52.395 --> 14:53.528
(laughs)

14:53.563 --> 14:55.396
Okay.

14:59.736 --> 15:01.736
(indistinct conversations,
phone ringing)

15:03.239 --> 15:05.456
(laughs quietly)
JEANNIE: Hey.

15:05.492 --> 15:07.658
Hey.

15:07.711 --> 15:09.827
191.

15:09.879 --> 15:12.880
Only nine more points,
and I'm out the door. Yay.

15:14.250 --> 15:17.335
Forget it. I mean...

15:17.387 --> 15:19.420
Um, I...
(clears throat)

15:19.422 --> 15:20.972
...was gonna tell you
I have an ultrasound

15:21.007 --> 15:22.557
appointment later today.

15:22.592 --> 15:24.425
Unless you need me...

15:24.477 --> 15:26.761
Oh, we got it.
It's no sweat.

15:26.813 --> 15:29.480
Okay. And...

15:29.516 --> 15:31.265
obviously...

15:31.267 --> 15:33.267
you're invited.

15:33.319 --> 15:35.653
I mean if you can or want...
Is... I mean, is

15:35.688 --> 15:36.738
everything okay?

15:36.773 --> 15:38.823
Yeah. It's routine.

15:38.858 --> 15:42.777
You can... get there yourself?

15:42.829 --> 15:44.278
Yeah. (laughs)

15:44.330 --> 15:46.164
That's not the problem.

15:46.199 --> 15:48.449
Okay.

15:50.503 --> 15:53.121
Okay. Great. Great.

15:59.345 --> 16:01.295
Hey! I am fucking pregnant,

16:01.347 --> 16:03.931
you cock sucker!

16:03.967 --> 16:06.968
Mr. Andrews?

16:06.970 --> 16:09.804
What do you mean,
he's not in school?

16:09.806 --> 16:11.639
(quietly):
Oh, fuck.

16:11.691 --> 16:13.107
No, of course, I had no i...

16:13.143 --> 16:14.942
No, I had no idea. I'll...

16:14.978 --> 16:16.978
Yes, I'll talk to him.

16:17.030 --> 16:18.980
Fuck me, man.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.287
(indistinct male voice
over P.A.)

16:30.493 --> 16:32.493
Come on, Roscoe.

16:36.666 --> 16:38.633
Hey, Pop.

16:38.668 --> 16:43.004
Um, I think I'm just gonna
go in there on my own, okay?

16:43.056 --> 16:45.006
Let's just say our
good-byes out here.

16:45.058 --> 16:46.340
(indistinct male voice
over P.A.)

16:46.342 --> 16:48.476
Okay.

16:52.732 --> 16:55.266
Yeah, I don't want you
to have to see that.

16:55.318 --> 16:56.734
Hmm. Oh, yeah?

16:56.769 --> 16:58.769
But this moment right here

16:58.822 --> 17:01.906
is going right into
my memory scrapbook.

17:01.941 --> 17:04.242
Listen, um...

17:04.277 --> 17:07.862
I'd give anything to not have
to miss this time with you.

17:07.914 --> 17:10.498
When I get out, I'm...
I'm gonna make it all up to you.

17:10.532 --> 17:11.699
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

17:11.701 --> 17:13.867
Gonna get in
those driving lessons.

17:13.869 --> 17:16.671
Um, take you to see whatever

17:16.705 --> 17:18.756
new, dumb <i> Hunger Games</i>
movie is out.

17:18.790 --> 17:21.425
I'll take you shopping,
wherever you want.

17:21.461 --> 17:23.010
That's just crazy talk.

17:23.046 --> 17:25.012
(both laughing)

17:26.799 --> 17:29.550
You're all that matters
to me, you know that.

17:32.889 --> 17:35.556
Remember you can trade smokes
for almost anything inside. (Laughs)

17:35.608 --> 17:37.391
Okay. Good tip, Al Capone.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.530
All right.
All right, love you.

17:42.565 --> 17:43.981
You, too.

17:44.033 --> 17:45.983
Uh, Dad, uh...

17:46.035 --> 17:49.654
I just wish you
didn't have to go.

17:49.706 --> 17:51.656
I know.

17:52.792 --> 17:54.876
Hey...

17:54.911 --> 17:58.496
Hey, it's gonna be
all right, okay?

17:58.548 --> 18:00.581
Okay.
Come on, give it up.

18:05.255 --> 18:06.921
(SUV door opens)

18:15.982 --> 18:18.816
JEREMY:
<i>That was killer.</i>

18:18.851 --> 18:20.484
And Roscoe got some.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.070
Oh. Oh, you know, a gentleman
does not kiss and tell.

18:23.106 --> 18:25.106
Oh.
I don't see any gentlemen here.

18:28.945 --> 18:30.444
You sluts.

18:30.496 --> 18:31.612
(laughter, door opening)

18:31.664 --> 18:33.781
Oh.

18:33.783 --> 18:35.416
Hey, Dad.
(Marty laughs)

18:35.451 --> 18:38.786
What up?

18:38.838 --> 18:40.478
(laughter) What are y'all doing?
Homework?

18:40.506 --> 18:42.256
Pokémon cards or something?

18:42.292 --> 18:43.893
We're just hanging out.
Just hanging out?

18:43.927 --> 18:45.259
Yeah.
We should do something.

18:45.295 --> 18:47.128
Let's play a game.
You guys want to play something?

18:47.180 --> 18:48.796
We could play Scrabble or

18:48.798 --> 18:50.631
Parcheesi or-or...
(laughter)

18:50.683 --> 18:52.800
Risk--
that sounds right.

18:52.802 --> 18:54.969
Dad, just chill.

18:54.971 --> 18:56.721
Okay. Oh, it's all right.
My bad.

18:56.773 --> 18:59.023
Gotta play something.

18:59.058 --> 19:00.975
Come on, let's play, um...

19:01.027 --> 19:04.395
what did I do today
instead of going to school?

19:07.817 --> 19:08.816
Dad, everyone...

19:08.868 --> 19:10.484
Eh-eh, eh...?

19:10.486 --> 19:11.786
I got a call

19:11.821 --> 19:13.204
from the headmaster--
talked to some other

19:13.239 --> 19:14.372
parents, too.

19:14.407 --> 19:15.906
We're outy.

19:15.959 --> 19:18.209
Yeah, we, uh, have
that math prep thing.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.460
MARTY:
Oh.

19:19.495 --> 19:20.911
Really?
That sounds like such a lie.

19:20.964 --> 19:22.325
You guys sure
you want to take off?

19:22.332 --> 19:23.497
You don't want to hang out?

19:23.549 --> 19:25.166
It's gonna be awesome!
(door opens)

19:25.168 --> 19:27.568
I mean, we're gonna talk all
about individual responsibility.

19:27.587 --> 19:29.837
(door closes)

19:32.392 --> 19:33.391
(sighs)

19:44.270 --> 19:46.854
Nothing, huh?

19:50.860 --> 19:53.160
Do you know that
I believe in you, Roscoe?

19:54.864 --> 19:56.864
No.

19:56.866 --> 19:59.583
Well, I do, okay? I <i> really</i> do.

19:59.619 --> 20:02.870
But all this business--
it's got me really worried.

20:02.872 --> 20:04.372
What do you want?

20:04.374 --> 20:05.790
What do I want?

20:05.842 --> 20:07.341
You have no idea, do you?

20:07.377 --> 20:10.511
Mm... want me to take shit
more seriously?

20:10.546 --> 20:14.682
I want you to be happy.

20:14.717 --> 20:17.018
That's it.

20:17.053 --> 20:20.855
I want you to be as happy as
you can, as much as you can.

20:20.890 --> 20:22.890
But you're not happy.

20:22.892 --> 20:25.976
Yeah, well, I'm working on it.

20:27.697 --> 20:29.447
Long time ago, my whole
happiness mechanism

20:29.482 --> 20:32.033
got broken pretty badly.

20:32.068 --> 20:35.369
Happiness mechanism--
that's not a thing.

20:35.405 --> 20:38.539
It is. It's a thing. For me.

20:43.046 --> 20:45.379
You're having another kid.

20:47.750 --> 20:50.251
Dad, you... you
don't even acknowledge it.

20:50.253 --> 20:53.587
I mean, what does that say
about your happiness?

20:53.589 --> 20:56.724
I would love it if we could just
talk about you right now.

20:56.759 --> 20:58.476
But you don't know
anything about me.

20:58.511 --> 21:01.312
So, I...

21:01.347 --> 21:02.980
Where-where should I start?

21:03.015 --> 21:05.649
Just start.

21:05.685 --> 21:07.685
Start anywhere.

21:09.105 --> 21:12.106
You'd be surprised how little
I would ever judge you.

21:14.610 --> 21:16.744
Did your parents know
your every move

21:16.779 --> 21:18.612
when you were my age?

21:18.664 --> 21:19.914
(scoffs)

21:19.949 --> 21:21.949
No. Definitely not.

21:21.951 --> 21:24.618
So, you did what you wanted.

21:24.620 --> 21:27.538
Yeah. And look how great
I turned out.

21:31.094 --> 21:33.177
Hey, listen, man.
Listen.

21:36.099 --> 21:39.300
I'm here, okay?

21:39.302 --> 21:41.352
Really not perfect,

21:41.387 --> 21:44.138
but... I'm here.

21:48.444 --> 21:50.478
Oh, and, uh,

21:50.530 --> 21:52.480
hickeys take about a week
to fade.

21:52.532 --> 21:54.815
Okay.

21:54.817 --> 21:56.817
DOUG:
<i>Oh, hey, Jeannie!</i>

21:56.819 --> 21:58.819
Jeannie, have you got a second?

21:58.821 --> 22:00.204
Yeah. What's up?

22:00.239 --> 22:02.540
Yeah, look, um, I was
just talking to Kelsey,

22:02.575 --> 22:04.325
and, uh, she said
she made you an offer

22:04.377 --> 22:05.543
to come in-house
for their company.

22:05.578 --> 22:06.794
Delusional bitch.

22:06.829 --> 22:07.869
DOUG:
Okay, I think we need

22:07.880 --> 22:09.330
to talk about your
anger issues, buddy.

22:09.332 --> 22:10.331
Oh, I think you should
shut the fuck up

22:10.333 --> 22:11.332
before I punch you in your face.

22:11.384 --> 22:12.633
It's not your fault.

22:12.668 --> 22:14.502
If you want a hug, I am here any time.
Ugh!

22:14.554 --> 22:16.086
Yeah, normally, I love to listen

22:16.139 --> 22:17.888
to you guys talk
about your feelings

22:17.924 --> 22:20.007
and your periods, but I...
today, I'm gonna...

22:20.009 --> 22:21.392
Oh, no, no, hold on, hold on.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.593
Jeannie, Jeannie, wait. Uh...

22:22.645 --> 22:24.512
The reason
I bring it up is because

22:24.514 --> 22:26.180
she seems to think
that you're seriously

22:26.182 --> 22:28.015
considering it, so, uh,

22:28.067 --> 22:29.817
you might want to talk to her
and let her down gently.

22:29.852 --> 22:32.019
I am seriously considering it.

22:32.021 --> 22:33.571
What are you talking about?

22:33.606 --> 22:35.573
Why would you consider that?

22:35.608 --> 22:37.658
Hold on a second--
are the money issues here

22:37.693 --> 22:39.160
worse than Marty's letting on?

22:39.195 --> 22:40.361
No, it's not that.

22:40.363 --> 22:41.779
Okay, so, why would you be

22:41.831 --> 22:43.197
seriously considering it?

22:43.249 --> 22:45.666
(laughs)

22:45.701 --> 22:48.002
Okay, well, since you Sherlocks
haven't caught on,

22:48.037 --> 22:49.537
and you're gonna
find out eventually,

22:49.539 --> 22:51.372
um, Marty has asked me to leave

22:51.374 --> 22:53.591
once the Gage business
is wrapped up.

22:53.626 --> 22:54.758
What?!

22:54.794 --> 22:55.876
CLYDE:
For real?

22:55.878 --> 22:57.711
What? Marty seriously...?

22:57.763 --> 22:59.213
Yeah, Marty seriously.

22:59.265 --> 23:00.881
No.

23:00.883 --> 23:02.683
Uh-uh, no, I
can't accept that.

23:02.718 --> 23:03.934
That's ridiculous.

23:03.970 --> 23:05.386
That's like breaking up
the Beatles.

23:05.388 --> 23:07.855
We're not the Beatles.
We're the Beatles, Jeannie.

23:07.890 --> 23:09.390
Think about it.
Marty's John.

23:09.392 --> 23:11.692
Uh, Clyde's Sir Paul.
Nice!

23:11.727 --> 23:14.111
I'm George, the quiet seeker.

23:14.146 --> 23:15.563
Uh, sorry. I'm Ringo?

23:15.565 --> 23:16.564
No. No, no, no, no.

23:16.616 --> 23:17.648
Oh, pfft...
No, I'm not Ringo.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.782
(laughing):
You're not Ringo.

23:18.818 --> 23:20.284
Calm down.

23:20.319 --> 23:22.369
You're the girl who's often
associated with the Beatles.

23:22.405 --> 23:24.905
Aw! He just
called you Yoko!

23:24.957 --> 23:25.789
To your face,

23:25.825 --> 23:27.291
he called you Yoko.

23:27.326 --> 23:29.043
Yeah. The <i> white</i> Yoko.

23:29.078 --> 23:30.294
The white Yoko?!
Oh, wow.

23:30.329 --> 23:31.795
Who's gonna do all your work?

23:31.831 --> 23:34.582
And ethically-questionable
flirting with the clients?

23:34.584 --> 23:35.916
I'm gonna miss you, too, Clyde.

23:35.968 --> 23:37.384
Oh...

23:37.420 --> 23:38.752
listen, I know that...

23:38.804 --> 23:41.305
Doesn't mean
that I want you to leave.

23:41.340 --> 23:44.225
Let's not do this right now, okay?
Yeah.

23:44.260 --> 23:46.310
I mean, are you gonna take that job?
I don't know.

23:46.345 --> 23:49.597
Before you do, if you do...
let me talk to Marty.

23:49.599 --> 23:51.148
I'll give him some tough love.

23:51.183 --> 23:53.017
We're kind of cut
from the same cloth...

23:53.069 --> 23:54.235
No!
No.

23:54.270 --> 23:56.103
I appreciate it, Doug, but, um,

23:56.105 --> 23:59.657
there's nothing you can do.

23:59.692 --> 24:01.108
No. Okay.
(clears throat)

24:01.160 --> 24:04.111
Oh, captain, my captain...

24:04.163 --> 24:05.029
Whoops.

24:06.365 --> 24:08.616
Clyde, come on.

24:08.618 --> 24:10.951
(snaps fingers) Clyde, come on.
Doesn't work if it's just me.

24:11.003 --> 24:12.953
Oh, I don't know.
I think it's working great.

24:14.624 --> 24:16.507
I'm actually a little touched.

24:19.045 --> 24:22.129
But I'm now gonna
get back to work.

24:24.183 --> 24:26.800
(sighs) CLYDE: Hey, captain, you
want to jump down,

24:26.802 --> 24:28.135
or are you good up there?
Shit!

24:28.187 --> 24:30.054
We're gonna need a new Yoko.

24:30.106 --> 24:31.972
Yeah.

24:31.974 --> 24:33.891
Okay.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.868
Will anyone else be
joining you today?

24:47.323 --> 24:49.290
(clears her throat)

24:49.325 --> 24:51.325
I'm good.
Let's just get started.

24:53.329 --> 24:55.996
(quiet whirring)

24:56.048 --> 24:59.049
This all looks good.

24:59.085 --> 25:01.168
She's almost in position.

25:01.170 --> 25:03.671
(heart beating over monitor)

25:03.723 --> 25:05.389
You want a jpeg
for your Facebook page?

25:05.424 --> 25:06.590
(laughing):
Facebook?

25:06.642 --> 25:08.175
Fuck, no.

25:08.177 --> 25:09.677
Uh...

25:09.679 --> 25:11.145
No.

25:11.180 --> 25:14.064
Sorry... this is a stock
I have to watch.

25:14.100 --> 25:17.234
Has to do with whether or not
I have to leave my company.

25:19.155 --> 25:20.521
(sighs)

25:20.573 --> 25:24.108
I have another offer,
but my partner is also the...

25:24.160 --> 25:26.243
well, the dad.

25:26.278 --> 25:27.695
Did I mention that?

25:27.697 --> 25:29.446
No worries.

25:29.498 --> 25:31.782
You just concentrate
on making this baby.

25:31.834 --> 25:34.368
It's really hard to know
what the right move is.

25:35.705 --> 25:37.705
I mean...

25:37.757 --> 25:41.542
if the father
of your child were angry,

25:41.544 --> 25:45.379
but it was hurting the both
of you, what would you do?

25:45.431 --> 25:47.431
Geez.

25:47.466 --> 25:50.184
That might be one
for your friends.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.388
Right. My friends.

25:54.390 --> 25:56.523
Yeah, I'll-I'll ask them.

26:14.577 --> 26:16.577
(ringtone playing)

26:19.415 --> 26:22.166
Hey, Doug.

26:22.218 --> 26:25.419
Broke 200, huh?

26:25.471 --> 26:26.420
No, it is.

26:26.472 --> 26:28.922
It-It's... it's great news.

26:28.974 --> 26:31.258
Doug, I can't talk
right now, okay?

26:31.260 --> 26:33.394
I got... Yes, all right. Bye.

26:36.766 --> 26:38.766
(phone chimes)

26:39.769 --> 26:41.819
Holy shit.
