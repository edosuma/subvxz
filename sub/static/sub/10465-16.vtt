21:57.934 --> 21:59.400
Do you see my belt?

21:59.400 --> 22:02.067
Uh, on the chair.

22:02.067 --> 22:05.000
I don't know. Um,

22:05.000 --> 22:06.234
volunteer stuff.

22:06.234 --> 22:09.334
Non-academic stuff.
Maybe work with kids.

22:09.334 --> 22:11.634
I mean, there are so many things
that I'm interested in

22:11.634 --> 22:15.000
that I've never had a chance to,
uh, um...

22:17.334 --> 22:20.434
It's just that my whole life
is pretty much about school.

22:20.434 --> 22:23.701
Well, you're almost done, right?

22:23.701 --> 22:25.801
Why don't you take
some time for yourself?

22:25.801 --> 22:27.167
Do what you want.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.434
Charlie, that is great
that you said that,

22:30.434 --> 22:32.334
'cause that's exactly
what I was thinking,

22:32.334 --> 22:34.033
you know, take time off.

22:34.033 --> 22:35.601
Keys. Keys.

22:35.601 --> 22:37.167
Yeah. Why not? I mean,

22:37.167 --> 22:39.367
'cause September's gonna be here
before you know it.

22:39.367 --> 22:41.734
Y-yeah. Well, actually,
I was kind of thinking--

22:41.734 --> 22:44.667
I remember what that was like
right before college.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.100
That was a great couple months.

22:47.801 --> 22:50.100
You know, I think you should
take the time off,

22:50.100 --> 22:52.534
'cause this is it, Jule.

22:52.534 --> 22:54.767
After this,
it gets serious.

22:54.767 --> 22:57.434
Y-you know, that--
That isn't exactly what I--

22:57.434 --> 22:59.033
You know what?
Um, I'll talk to Grace

22:59.033 --> 23:01.400
about volunteer programs.
Okay?

23:01.400 --> 23:04.133

23:04.133 --> 23:06.100
Thanks.

23:10.100 --> 23:13.267
Wow. You were right.
It's deserted today.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.167
Told you, as soon as
the job's almost done,

23:15.167 --> 23:17.467
they move all the volunteers
to the next site.

23:17.467 --> 23:19.334
Suckers like us get to finish,
huh?

23:19.334 --> 23:20.667
Ah, it's not that bad.

23:20.667 --> 23:23.234
Just a coat of paint and some
trim. We can do it alone.

23:23.234 --> 23:24.834
Sure.

23:24.834 --> 23:26.801
No problem.

23:26.801 --> 23:30.334
What? Are you nervous
about us being alone?

23:30.334 --> 23:31.801
No.

23:31.801 --> 23:32.868
Are you?

23:34.334 --> 23:35.634
Of course not.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.200
Owen, look at you.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.367
What are you doing?

23:42.367 --> 23:44.434
I'm hiding, and I'm painting.

23:44.434 --> 23:47.033
Yeah, you are, aren't you?

23:47.033 --> 23:50.434
Well, Jule had some plans
so I took him today.

23:50.434 --> 23:53.767
Uh-huh.
No, she did.

23:53.767 --> 23:57.567
Gracie, you dragged me over here
to help you with that garden.

23:57.567 --> 24:00.267
There's nothing out back
except concrete.

24:00.267 --> 24:02.200

24:02.200 --> 24:04.300

There she is.

24:13.033 --> 24:14.834
My success story.

24:14.834 --> 24:17.167
I heard last night.
How does it feel?

24:17.167 --> 24:19.701
Um, actually,
I feel pretty good, but--

24:19.701 --> 24:22.300
All those talks we had
about safety schools--

24:22.300 --> 24:25.400
Ah. Stanford, I--
I can just see you there, Julia,

24:25.400 --> 24:28.234
amazing the faculty,
bewitching the boys.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.234
Yeah, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

24:30.234 --> 24:32.167
I don't think
I'm gonna go.

24:32.167 --> 24:35.100
So I don't know if there's
anything your office needs to do

24:35.100 --> 24:36.133
like send a letter or--

24:36.133 --> 24:39.601
Well, um,
you're deferring a year?

24:39.601 --> 24:41.634
Julia, Stanford's not
gonna like that.

24:41.634 --> 24:42.801
You applied early.

24:42.801 --> 24:45.601
No, not a year.
I mean, maybe a year.

24:45.601 --> 24:48.467
Maybe two.
Maybe I'll never go.

24:48.467 --> 24:50.667
Julia, I don't understand.

24:50.667 --> 24:52.734
Stanford's your first choice.

24:52.734 --> 24:54.534
Why would you--?
No. See, this is great.

24:54.534 --> 24:56.634
I'll finally be able
to take the time to figure out

24:56.634 --> 24:59.000
what I wanna do with my life.
It's the perfect solution.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.334
Julia, wait.

25:00.334 --> 25:02.767
You know, I think you need give
this some more thought.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.601
No, I don't. Really.

25:04.601 --> 25:06.100
So I'm gonna write
and tell them.

25:06.100 --> 25:08.601
And if you need to do anything
through your office, will you?

we said 8:00.

25:47.434 --> 25:50.467
No. We did.
It's just, uh, I'm--

25:50.467 --> 25:52.968
Oh, I-I'm sorry. Am I, um--?

25:52.968 --> 25:54.000

25:54.000 --> 25:55.601
We were finishing.
Something wrong?

25:55.601 --> 25:57.167
No, no, no.
It's just about tonight.

25:57.167 --> 25:58.767
I'm such an idiot.
I totally forgot.

25:58.767 --> 26:01.167
I promised my mom I'd come by
and hook up her VCR.

26:01.167 --> 26:02.934
So could we meet
a little later?

26:02.934 --> 26:06.567
Well, sure. But, um, she lives
in North Beach, right?

26:06.567 --> 26:08.000
Why don't I just
come with you?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.801
We can eat over there.

26:09.801 --> 26:11.667
Um, I don't know, Ross.

26:11.667 --> 26:13.601
I-- It would--

26:13.601 --> 26:15.467
It's better if we meet up later.

26:15.467 --> 26:17.400
But why?

26:17.400 --> 26:19.133
I mean,
I'm not very good with VCRs,

26:19.133 --> 26:21.968

26:21.968 --> 26:22.901
okay?

26:26.968 --> 26:29.734
I think I'm gonna

26:29.734 --> 26:31.400
something.

26:34.567 --> 26:38.033
Paul, I thought, um--

26:38.033 --> 26:40.367
I thought you told me
you were out to your mom.

She, uh...

26:45.400 --> 26:46.734
No.

26:52.434 --> 26:54.767
at that Moroccan place

26:54.767 --> 26:56.734
Okay. Or how about
a dark alley somewhere?

26:56.734 --> 26:57.868
Would that work for you?

26:57.868 --> 26:59.534

Ross, that's not what this--
I'm sorry.

27:01.701 --> 27:04.701
It's just that I can understand

You know what?

27:12.501 --> 27:14.300
I know what it's like.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.300
But that means that

you look at us as something
to be ashamed of.

for a beer a page.

that is...

you're ready, that's okay.

Well, anyway, I was, um--

32:29.000 --> 32:31.367
I was talking to him
yesterday and

32:31.367 --> 32:33.767
turns out that
he's single and--

32:33.767 --> 32:35.467
Don't. Okay, Claud?

32:35.467 --> 32:37.000
That's really not the answer.

32:45.400 --> 32:48.334
I'm sorry.

32:48.334 --> 32:51.868
I'm sorry about you
and Mr. Archer.

32:53.200 --> 32:56.901
It's just-- I think you
did the right thing.

32:56.901 --> 32:59.400
You know what?

32:59.400 --> 33:02.734
It's-- It's fine to go around
saying "Be who you are."

33:02.734 --> 33:04.868
But until you've
been there...

33:07.501 --> 33:10.000
Remember how you reacted
when I came out to you?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.767
I thought you were never
gonna speak to me again.

33:12.767 --> 33:14.334
I was 11.

33:14.334 --> 33:17.033
And in case you hadn't noticed,
I got over it.

33:17.033 --> 33:20.634
Yeah. Well, not everybody does.
Okay?

33:20.634 --> 33:24.634
I have friends whose parents
disowned them or--

33:24.634 --> 33:27.434
Or they lost friends when they
came out and that's--

33:28.801 --> 33:32.033
So I--
I know what Paul's afraid of,

33:32.033 --> 33:33.767
what he's going through.

33:33.767 --> 33:35.934
But if I stayed with him, if I--

33:35.934 --> 33:38.767
If I let myself do that,

33:38.767 --> 33:42.033
I would be right back
in the closet.

33:42.033 --> 33:45.434
And nothing is worth that.

33:46.601 --> 33:48.400
So you're better off.

33:49.934 --> 33:51.901
Yeah.

33:51.901 --> 33:55.167
A whole lot better.

33:55.167 --> 33:59.400
So, um, what are you gonna do,
you know, instead?

33:59.400 --> 34:01.634
I don't know, get a job.

34:01.634 --> 34:03.000
Get a few jobs,

34:03.000 --> 34:06.868
keep getting them until
I find one that I love.

34:06.868 --> 34:09.199
Uh, I'm sorry.
I'm a little lost here.

34:09.199 --> 34:10.701
When did this--?

34:10.701 --> 34:13.501
Is this, like,
a reaction to Libby?

34:13.501 --> 34:15.400
A little.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.333
Sure.

34:17.167 --> 34:18.634
But you know what?

34:18.634 --> 34:20.300
I think there were things

34:20.300 --> 34:22.266
that I was already
struggling with, you know?

34:22.266 --> 34:25.167
Things that I had
on my mind for a while.

34:25.167 --> 34:27.667
Really?

34:27.667 --> 34:29.234
Like, how long?

34:29.234 --> 34:32.534
Say, back when we were doing
the application?

34:32.534 --> 34:34.801
Yeah.

34:34.801 --> 34:39.000
You know, it took me four days
to mail that envelope.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.534
So even then I must have been
having doubts.

34:41.534 --> 34:45.534
So this was just kind of like
a-- An ego exercise for you?

34:45.534 --> 34:47.033
What? No.

34:47.033 --> 34:48.634
That's kind of what
it sounds like.

34:48.634 --> 34:50.132
You know,
see how much they want you

34:50.132 --> 34:51.534
even though
you don't want them.

34:51.534 --> 34:53.000
Sarah, what is your problem?

34:53.000 --> 34:56.132
I-- I thought you of all people
would be understanding.

34:56.132 --> 34:59.167
God, Julia, you took one
of the early decisions places

34:59.167 --> 35:01.000
at Stanford,
one that you knew I wanted.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.667
I didn't take it, okay?

35:02.667 --> 35:04.567
It was offered to me,
and I'm not taking it.

35:04.567 --> 35:06.567
So you can still--
Thanks for the charity.

35:06.567 --> 35:09.000
You're what?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.133
Did you just say that you're
not going to Stanford?

35:13.801 --> 35:15.968
That's-- That's what I was
trying to tell you.

35:15.968 --> 35:17.601
And this is done?

35:17.601 --> 35:20.200
I mean, let's at least
talk about this--

35:20.200 --> 35:22.901
Why? So--? So that you can
tell me I'm wrong too?

35:22.901 --> 35:25.300
No, thank you.
Jule, don't just walk away.

36:11.467 --> 36:13.067
and I copied half the poem.

36:14.801 --> 36:17.467
And here, my God,
I wrote the same paragraph two--

I've been working on this paper.

right?

41:28.634 --> 41:30.934
That's right. But it'd show up
on your transcript--
