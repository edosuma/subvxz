18:54.466 --> 18:55.466
Hiram Abiff.

18:55.634 --> 18:59.512
He was an architect, who according to the
Freemasons, built Solomon's first temple.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.974
And his hammer is integral to
the relocation of the Warehouse...

19:03.142 --> 19:04.475
...from one country to the next.

How do we stop Valda if he has
everything he needs to steal it?

19:07.271 --> 19:10.857
He does not have everything. The Setting
Maul is only one of three artefacts...

19:11.024 --> 19:13.776
...that precipitate the moving
of the Warehouse. The others are...

19:13.944 --> 19:16.195

19:16.363 --> 19:17.530
STEVE:
He already stole the Square.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.741
So he's probably already chosen
the location of the new warehouse.

19:20.909 --> 19:24.871
Now, the placement of the Square tells the
Compass where to transport the artefacts.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.414
How does the Compass work?

19:26.582 --> 19:29.667
Once the Setting Maul has been
reassembled, it activates the Compass.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.419
Then, the Compass sweeps
the Warehouse...

19:31.587 --> 19:34.005
...converts the artefacts' energy,
directs all that energy...

19:34.173 --> 19:36.549

When it's time for the Warehouse
to move...

19:56.403 --> 19:59.280
...then the two pieces
of the Maul are reunited.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.575
And the Compass is triggered,
which begins to phase out the artefacts.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.327
To complete the transfer...

20:04.494 --> 20:08.039
...the Setting Maul has to be struck against
the cornerstone of the new warehouse...

20:08.207 --> 20:13.127
...phasing in the artefacts to that location.
We have to stop Valda from doing that.

You look me in the eye
and tell me I'm lying.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.981
I am in love with Myka Bering.

41:28.527 --> 41:30.028
[GASPS]

41:30.196 --> 41:31.529
Damn it.

41:33.282 --> 41:34.657
I know.

41:35.951 --> 41:37.952
[BOTH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

41:40.080 --> 41:41.915
I just....

41:42.291 --> 41:45.251
I can't believe that
the Warehouse almost moved.

41:45.586 --> 41:49.631
We've been here for five years,
you know? It feels like home.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.884
- Try 40 years. Little piece of advice...
- Heh.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.887
...take it one snag at a time.

41:56.055 --> 41:57.722
Something I've learned on this job.

41:58.891 --> 42:02.060
Because you never know
when things are gonna...

42:03.354 --> 42:04.562
[♪♪♪]

42:04.730 --> 42:06.564
...change.

42:09.151 --> 42:12.070
- Artie, I thought we stopped it.
- We did.

42:13.614 --> 42:16.574
- There's a problem, isn't there?
- Yes.

42:18.827 --> 42:22.080
We retrieved the Setting Maul.
We stopped the Warehouse from moving.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.207
Why is that Compass still active?

42:25.084 --> 42:28.461
I had a feeling. Yes.

42:29.129 --> 42:33.341
I'm afraid Benedict Valda's actions
may have set certain events into motion.

42:33.509 --> 42:37.470
- Events? What kind of events?
- The kind that even I...

42:37.638 --> 42:39.264
...may be unable to stop.

42:39.473 --> 42:41.140
