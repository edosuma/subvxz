I have spent my adult life

00:02.960 --> 00:03.993
working with abnormals,

00:03.994 --> 00:05.228
and now I am one.

[Magnus]: My father
never gave me a gift

00:06.197 --> 00:07.931
without significance.

00:07.932 --> 00:08.932
What is
this place?

00:08.933 --> 00:10.100
Do you think
it exists?

00:10.101 --> 00:11.735
If it does,
we have to find it.

00:46.804 --> 00:48.905
It's only me.

00:50.841 --> 00:51.941
What the hell?

00:52.977 --> 00:54.410
I couldn't sleep.

00:54.411 --> 00:56.980
Daft bastard.

00:56.981 --> 00:59.082
How'd you get in here?

01:01.519 --> 01:03.887
Oh, I left a pint of whisky out
for O'Brien.

01:03.888 --> 01:05.221
As soon as he'd nodded off...

01:07.458 --> 01:08.725
You fancy a game?

01:08.726 --> 01:09.726
Gin rummy?

01:09.727 --> 01:10.860
At this hour?

01:10.861 --> 01:12.061
Oh, go on, a quick one.

01:14.298 --> 01:15.331
One.

01:24.074 --> 01:25.074
You okay?

01:25.075 --> 01:26.075
I don't know.

01:26.076 --> 01:29.546
I haven't felt right all day.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.848
I had no stomach for supper,

01:31.849 --> 01:33.750
and my heart's thumping
like a bugger,

01:33.751 --> 01:36.286
and I swear I can...

01:37.288 --> 01:38.221
What?

01:42.493 --> 01:44.360
Hear things.

01:44.361 --> 01:46.162
Such as?

01:46.163 --> 01:47.764

01:47.765 --> 01:49.866

Mary at the end
of the hall,

01:57.441 --> 01:59.542
short, quick,

01:59.543 --> 02:03.046
like she's dreaming.

02:03.047 --> 02:05.481
I don't hear nothing.

02:05.482 --> 02:09.318
Did you talk to
Dr. Myers?

02:09.320 --> 02:10.553
She gave me
some sort of a shot.

02:10.554 --> 02:14.290
Told me not to worry.

02:14.291 --> 02:16.526
Liam, just deal.

02:16.527 --> 02:19.195
I want to go
back to sleep, eh?

Hey.

03:01.705 --> 03:04.573
Oh, Kate and the big guy
said to say " <i>hasta luego</i> ."

03:04.574 --> 03:06.175
They offered to bring back
a chupacabra,

03:06.176 --> 03:07.710
but I said you weren't
dating right now.

03:07.711 --> 03:09.278
Ha ha!

03:09.279 --> 03:10.279
That's very funny.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.714
Hey, what's this?

03:11.715 --> 03:13.615
A werewolf sighting?

03:13.616 --> 03:15.417
Yeah, we don't use
the "w" word around here.

03:15.418 --> 03:16.752
Oh, right, right.
It's, uh, hap.

03:16.753 --> 03:18.387
It's a hyper-
accelerated protean,

03:18.388 --> 03:19.688
thank you very much.

03:19.689 --> 03:21.590
So, you think
there's more like you?

03:21.591 --> 03:22.925
Yeah...

03:22.926 --> 03:25.527
These things never
really pan out.

03:25.528 --> 03:27.463
Okay, so you're curious,

03:27.464 --> 03:28.931
but you're afraid
to ask the boss

03:28.932 --> 03:30.532
if you can go.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.468
Yeah, well, over
the last hundred years,

03:32.469 --> 03:33.736
there's been
several sightings

03:33.737 --> 03:35.003
in this area
of northern England, right?

03:35.004 --> 03:36.405
Really?

03:36.406 --> 03:38.474
Yeah, it's all centered
around a 30-kilometer radius

03:38.475 --> 03:39.708
of a town called Oldham.

03:39.709 --> 03:41.543
Oldham, hmm.

03:41.544 --> 03:42.811
Maybe it's something
in the water.

03:42.812 --> 03:43.779
Or the Guinness.

03:43.780 --> 03:45.013
It doesn't matter.

03:45.014 --> 03:46.081
These things
are never real.

03:46.082 --> 03:47.416
You know
what I mean?

03:47.417 --> 03:49.718
Guinness...

03:49.719 --> 03:50.552
Let's go.

03:50.553 --> 03:51.954
What?

03:51.955 --> 03:53.922
Let's take a road trip,
just Butch and Sundance.

03:53.923 --> 03:56.425
What about Magnus
and the magnet?

03:56.426 --> 03:57.760
Those two are so obsessed
with the city model,

03:57.761 --> 03:58.727
they won't even notice
we're gone.

03:59.829 --> 04:01.296
Are you serious?

04:01.297 --> 04:02.731
Yeah. Look, if it
turns out to be nothing,

04:02.732 --> 04:03.766
at least we had some laughs.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.701
Okay, what if we find--

04:05.702 --> 04:06.969
Well, then
we'll call in the troops.

04:06.970 --> 04:08.470
Come on, man,

04:08.471 --> 04:09.505
I can already taste
the warm beer

04:09.506 --> 04:10.539
and prawn crisps.

04:10.540 --> 04:12.374
Come on.

04:12.375 --> 04:13.842
Dude...

04:13.843 --> 04:14.877
Oh, so I give you
the best hours of my life,

04:14.878 --> 04:17.178
and this is
how you repay me, huh?

04:17.180 --> 04:19.447
You teasing harlot
from Camden.

04:19.449 --> 04:20.949

04:22.017 --> 04:23.118
Oh, no, it knows
what I'm saying.

04:23.119 --> 04:24.086
Don't you?

04:24.087 --> 04:26.488
Yes. Precisely.

04:27.891 --> 04:30.058
You know, it's been
six days of this.

04:30.059 --> 04:31.126
My wine cellar's depleted,

04:31.127 --> 04:32.561
and frankly,

04:32.562 --> 04:34.029
you need a shower.

04:34.030 --> 04:35.531
Where would
science be today

04:35.532 --> 04:37.900
if I constantly
stopped to bathe?

04:37.901 --> 04:41.036
It's so damned
confounding.

04:41.037 --> 04:44.139
Perhaps Gregory's
merely toying with us.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.642
No, no, nothing
my father ever did

04:46.643 --> 04:47.910
was random.

04:47.911 --> 04:49.678
There's a puzzle here.

04:49.679 --> 04:50.879
A puzzle he
expects me to solve.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.047
It must be important.

04:52.048 --> 04:54.483
Ll, I hate to
disappoint dear old pater,

04:54.484 --> 04:56.151
but clearly this city
can't exist.

04:56.152 --> 04:57.986
Not currently,
no, of course.

04:57.987 --> 04:59.855
It's far too large
to go unnoticed.

04:59.856 --> 05:01.824
No, I mean,
even if it did exist,

05:01.825 --> 05:02.891
it couldn't.

05:02.892 --> 05:05.060
It's architecturally
impossible.

05:05.061 --> 05:06.628
We don't have
the building materials

05:06.629 --> 05:08.130
or the technology
available

05:08.131 --> 05:09.731
to build
such an urban leviathan.

05:09.732 --> 05:12.668
The builders of
this hologram might have.

05:12.669 --> 05:13.902
Speaking of
architecture,

05:13.903 --> 05:17.406
there's a mosaic on
one of these buildings.

05:17.407 --> 05:18.974
Now, there are subtle,

05:18.975 --> 05:20.142
but very definite similarities

05:20.143 --> 05:22.211
between the symbols
on that mosaic

05:22.212 --> 05:23.812
and these ancient
Sumerian cuneiforms.

05:23.813 --> 05:24.813
Be still, my heart.

05:24.814 --> 05:27.549
The symbol for the sun.

05:27.550 --> 05:29.585
The word "sumer" translates

05:29.586 --> 05:30.919
as "land of the lords
of brightness."

05:30.920 --> 05:32.187
A sun?

05:32.188 --> 05:34.790
Mmm. A sun...

05:34.791 --> 05:39.127
Now, I seem to recall seeing...

05:39.128 --> 05:42.764
Look on the top
of that skyscraper.

05:42.765 --> 05:46.802
It's the same symbol.

05:51.541 --> 05:53.842
There's another
one of those.

05:53.843 --> 05:54.910
Uh...

05:56.813 --> 05:58.647
Here.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.987
Does this remind
you of anything?

06:04.988 --> 06:07.022
Progressive sequencing.

06:07.023 --> 06:08.857
Like tumblers
in a combination lock.

06:08.858 --> 06:10.125
Exactly.

06:10.126 --> 06:14.096
I think we may have just found
a way in.

06:15.765 --> 06:19.134
[Howling]

06:19.135 --> 06:20.235
That's pretty good,

06:20.236 --> 06:21.603
but we don't really
do that, though.

06:21.604 --> 06:22.571
Okay.

06:22.572 --> 06:23.605
How many pubs have we
been to already?

06:23.606 --> 06:25.908
Uh, six--

06:25.909 --> 06:27.943
no, seven--
no...

06:27.944 --> 06:29.745
Yeah, seven,
but, you know,

06:29.746 --> 06:30.812
it's all in the name of
scientific research, so...

06:30.813 --> 06:31.813
[In British accent]:
Absolutely,

06:31.814 --> 06:33.415
and what have we learned
so far, William?

06:33.416 --> 06:35.651
[Imitating Sean Connery]:
That, uh, "spotted dick"

06:35.652 --> 06:37.786
is actually a dessert.

06:37.787 --> 06:39.821
And the people in this town
love to tell stories.

06:39.822 --> 06:40.689
Oh, yeah.

06:40.690 --> 06:42.124
We've got fairies...

06:42.125 --> 06:43.058
Hobgoblins...

06:43.059 --> 06:43.959
Leprechauns.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.260
Which everyone knows
is baloney,

06:45.261 --> 06:46.828
because the only place
you find Leprechauns

06:46.829 --> 06:47.829
is in Ireland.

06:47.830 --> 06:48.697
Right.

06:48.698 --> 06:50.132
And as a son
of the emerald isle,

06:50.133 --> 06:52.167
I resent the usurpment
of my national icon.

06:52.168 --> 06:53.702
Wait a second,
"Zimmerman" is Irish?

06:53.703 --> 06:54.836
Me ma's from Dublin.

06:54.837 --> 06:55.671
Really?

06:55.672 --> 06:56.538
Yeah.

06:56.539 --> 06:57.573
I didn't know that.

06:57.574 --> 06:58.640
Okay, wild wolf chase.

06:58.641 --> 07:00.842
Sorry to drag you
along, buddy.

07:01.911 --> 07:03.011
[Flies buzzing]

07:03.012 --> 07:04.112
What is that?

07:06.215 --> 07:07.249
Uh...

07:07.250 --> 07:10.686
Looks like a...
Goat.

07:10.687 --> 07:12.988
Yeah, that's been
ripped to pieces.

07:25.868 --> 07:26.935
You got something?

07:26.936 --> 07:28.036
It looks like

07:28.037 --> 07:30.038
some crushed vegetation

07:30.039 --> 07:31.573
heading off in the direction

07:31.574 --> 07:34.876
we just came.

07:34.877 --> 07:35.877
This is weird.

07:35.878 --> 07:36.778
What?

07:36.779 --> 07:38.914
Well...

07:38.915 --> 07:42.017
There's a trail
of blood

07:42.018 --> 07:44.219
coming from this way.

07:44.220 --> 07:47.222
Hmm.

07:51.828 --> 07:53.862
Looks like
it came from there.

07:53.863 --> 07:55.697
Yeah, whatever
that is.

07:57.867 --> 08:00.335
[Declan]: The Oldham
Psychiatric Institute.

08:00.336 --> 08:02.237
Okay, so you've heard
the reports as well?

08:02.238 --> 08:03.205
Have you ever
investigated?

08:03.206 --> 08:04.206
Oh, we tried.

08:04.207 --> 08:05.807
Each time we attempted
to gain access,

08:05.808 --> 08:07.009
we were turned away.

08:07.010 --> 08:08.310
Hmm, suspicious.

08:08.311 --> 08:09.745
No, not really.

08:09.746 --> 08:10.746
They're a private
facility.

08:10.747 --> 08:12.247
They can do
what they like,

08:12.248 --> 08:13.482
within reason.

08:13.483 --> 08:15.083
Right, okay,
so in a town that small,

08:15.084 --> 08:16.885
what better place
to hide a hap?

08:16.886 --> 08:18.120
Your evidence?

08:19.288 --> 08:20.122
G-goat.

08:20.123 --> 08:21.289
Yeah.

08:21.290 --> 08:22.457
It's going to
take more

08:22.458 --> 08:23.759
than a dead goat
and village rumors

08:23.760 --> 08:24.993
to launch a full-scale
investigation.

08:29.599 --> 08:30.832
Tell me you're
not thinking

08:30.833 --> 08:31.733
of doing
anything foolish.

08:31.734 --> 08:33.902
Wha-- who, us?

08:33.903 --> 08:36.004
No, no, we're just
a couple of blokes

08:36.005 --> 08:37.205
on our holidays.

08:37.206 --> 08:39.006
Whatever.

08:39.008 --> 08:40.207
So there's
no reason for me

08:40.208 --> 08:41.809
to bring Magnus into
the loop on this, then?

08:41.811 --> 08:43.945
[Together]: No.

08:43.946 --> 08:47.182
Right then, gents,
enjoy the countryside.

08:47.183 --> 08:50.986
See ya.

08:50.987 --> 08:54.656
So, Henry...

08:54.657 --> 08:57.025
These episodes are becoming
more frequent?

08:57.026 --> 08:58.694
Yeah.

08:58.695 --> 09:00.996
And I just feel like
I might hurt someone,

09:00.997 --> 09:02.330
or, like, myself,
you know?

09:02.331 --> 09:04.800
He's been suffering
paranoid delusions

09:04.801 --> 09:05.767
that have been escalating

09:05.768 --> 09:08.036
into increasingly
violent seizures.

09:08.037 --> 09:09.738
Of course, I could
treat him at home,

09:09.739 --> 09:11.373
but his family have
recently relocated

09:11.374 --> 09:12.908
to England, and...

09:12.909 --> 09:17.646
Our facility, while old,
is state of the art.

09:17.647 --> 09:19.981
Okay.

09:19.982 --> 09:21.249
My niece, Erika, will take you

09:21.250 --> 09:23.251
for an evaluation.

09:23.252 --> 09:24.853
You'll be fine.

09:24.854 --> 09:26.988
Of course he will.

09:27.990 --> 09:29.024
Come along, Henry.

09:33.262 --> 09:36.031
So, Dr. Zimmerman...

09:36.032 --> 09:37.399
According to your C.V.,

09:37.400 --> 09:39.735
your last employment reference
was three years ago.

09:39.736 --> 09:42.003
Yes, since then

09:42.004 --> 09:45.407
I've been engaged on
a private consultation basis.

09:45.408 --> 09:47.209
Oh, indeed?

09:47.210 --> 09:48.310

09:48.311 --> 09:51.713
Y...eah.

09:52.749 --> 09:53.982
That's pretty cool.

09:53.983 --> 09:56.284
Is that a subsonic
oscillator?

09:56.285 --> 09:58.720
Do you like
electronics?

09:58.721 --> 09:59.821

10:03.092 --> 10:04.960

10:04.961 --> 10:06.394
Is that
part of the test?

10:06.395 --> 10:07.763
No.

10:07.764 --> 10:09.831
Now, just relax,

10:09.832 --> 10:11.032
and answer my questions

10:11.033 --> 10:13.335
with the first thing
that comes to your mind.

10:13.336 --> 10:14.870
Okay.

10:14.871 --> 10:16.838
What's your favorite
flavor of ice cream?

10:16.839 --> 10:18.140
Chocolate.

10:18.141 --> 10:19.941
Do you prefer
summer or winter?

10:19.942 --> 10:22.043
Summer.

How do you feel?

10:35.057 --> 10:36.158
Sad.

10:41.898 --> 10:43.165
You're doing fine.

10:45.368 --> 10:47.035
...And as you can see,

10:47.036 --> 10:49.070

plenty of activities

occupied.

[Telephones ring busily]

10:52.742 --> 10:55.076

I'm well impressed.

Ah, Erika,
how did Henry do?

10:57.947 --> 11:00.482
See for yourself.

11:01.818 --> 11:04.119
Oh, well done.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.253
A moment, if I may?

11:05.254 --> 11:06.922
Sure.

Something weird is
definitely going on here.

11:13.095 --> 11:15.730

and the stim receptors,

11:15.731 --> 11:17.999
that's no psych test
I've ever heard of.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.401
There's definitely
something

11:19.402 --> 11:21.136
I can't
put my finger on.

11:21.137 --> 11:22.938
All right, I'm going to
go out and call Magnus,

11:24.173 --> 11:27.742
Okay, I'm going to snoop around
on my own a little bit

11:27.743 --> 11:28.844
from the inside.

11:29.979 --> 11:31.446
Really?

11:31.447 --> 11:33.248
You realize what you're
getting yourself into?

11:35.017 --> 11:36.885
I know,
but think about it, will.

the ending of my line.

I might never know.

11:43.125 --> 11:45.460
You were right
about Henry.

11:45.461 --> 11:47.863
Well, you must have
suspected it too.

11:47.864 --> 11:50.065
The question is,

11:50.066 --> 11:52.400
why would he show up
out of the blue?

11:52.401 --> 11:55.537
Here, of all places.

11:55.538 --> 11:57.539
Well, at least
he found us.

11:57.540 --> 12:00.375
I mean, does it
really matter how?

12:03.012 --> 12:06.414
There. Now we're
getting somewhere.

12:06.415 --> 12:08.116
And you bathed.

Thank you so much.

If we can just focus on

up and running...

Excellent.

those flashing symbols,

do us much good.

13:10.494 --> 13:12.261
I did find an old

that you might be able
to resuscitate.

13:14.264 --> 13:15.731

it could give us lights.

I'm too exhausted
to even banter with you.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.701
Fine.

We all are.

20:10.814 --> 20:13.582
[Whispering]: What?

20:15.919 --> 20:19.722
Wait...

20:19.723 --> 20:20.723
You?

20:22.659 --> 20:24.059
And Aunt Lillian,

20:24.060 --> 20:25.961
and all of our patients.

20:29.699 --> 20:31.567
We're all just like you.

20:39.642 --> 20:41.410
Let me help you.

20:41.411 --> 20:44.713
I'm a friend.
I'm not going to hurt you.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.484
Oh, come on.

21:03.566 --> 21:04.633
[Beast snarls]

21:14.853 --> 21:16.520
[Beast snarls,
will winces in pain]

21:22.393 --> 21:24.394
[Roaring]

21:24.395 --> 21:25.796
[Blow thuds]

21:30.201 --> 21:32.970
[Car approaches, horn blaring]

21:46.727 --> 21:47.827
So you're telling me

21:47.838 --> 21:50.006
that everyone in this
place is a hap?

21:51.942 --> 21:53.977
A hyper-accelerated
protean.

21:53.978 --> 21:55.879
We don't use
those words,

21:55.880 --> 21:57.247
but yes.

21:57.248 --> 21:58.882
That's why
we accepted you.

21:58.883 --> 22:00.150
We're all
therianthropes,

22:00.151 --> 22:02.152
the last of the Lycan clan.

22:02.153 --> 22:04.954
Wow.

22:04.955 --> 22:06.790
Okay, well, that explains

22:06.791 --> 22:08.124
all the werewolf sightings
in the area.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.426
For centuries,

22:09.427 --> 22:11.027
we've been hunted
almost to extinction,

22:11.028 --> 22:13.129
and that's why
this facility was built,

22:13.130 --> 22:14.731
to protect our kind.

22:14.732 --> 22:16.065
In here,
we are safe.

22:16.066 --> 22:18.067
This is our refuge,

22:18.068 --> 22:19.836
our family.

22:19.837 --> 22:20.937
So naturally,

22:20.938 --> 22:23.273
we're cautious of strangers.

22:23.274 --> 22:24.774
How did you find us, Henry?

22:24.775 --> 22:27.677
I'm from a place
called the Sanctuary.

22:27.678 --> 22:29.779
It provides
safe harbor

22:29.780 --> 22:30.613
for all sorts
of abnormals,

22:30.614 --> 22:32.649
not just me.

22:32.650 --> 22:35.285
So, you've already found
where you belong?

22:35.286 --> 22:37.754
Yeah, I think so.

22:37.755 --> 22:40.523
I just, um...

22:40.524 --> 22:41.825
I've never met anyone
like me before.

22:41.826 --> 22:43.927
What do you know about
where you came from?

22:43.928 --> 22:44.761
Not much.

22:44.762 --> 22:46.830
I was a foundling.

22:46.831 --> 22:48.832
No memory of my parents.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.200
I don't know,
maybe they're from around here.

22:50.201 --> 22:53.303
I can run a DNA check
and see if I might find a clue.

22:54.972 --> 22:57.907
This is amazing.
I don't know,
maybe they're from around here.

22:57.908 --> 22:59.042
I always thought I was alone.

23:02.079 --> 23:04.581
Now I know that's not true.

23:11.155 --> 23:12.922
[Doorknob rattles]

23:14.258 --> 23:17.293
[Knob rattling furiously]

23:19.830 --> 23:20.697
[Cocks gun]

23:21.866 --> 23:23.733
What are you doing
in my bedroom?

23:23.734 --> 23:25.034
[Inhales sharply]

23:25.035 --> 23:26.269
Well, I could think
of a dozen answers,

23:26.270 --> 23:29.606
but I'll leave that
to Oscar Wilde.

23:29.607 --> 23:31.207
I figured it out.

23:31.208 --> 23:33.209
In the middle
of the night.

23:33.210 --> 23:35.044
Well, that's when
genius works best,

23:35.045 --> 23:36.746
doesn't it?

23:36.747 --> 23:38.781
Nice curtains,
by the way.

23:38.782 --> 23:41.017
Lovely pale yellow.

23:41.018 --> 23:43.319
Or are they?

23:43.320 --> 23:44.921
Yellow. White.

23:44.922 --> 23:46.289
Yellow--

23:46.290 --> 23:47.824
you're suggesting
a spectrum shift.

23:47.825 --> 23:49.526
I'm suggesting
going beyond the spectrum,

23:49.527 --> 23:50.760
below infrared.

23:50.761 --> 23:53.363
You don't happen to have
a quantum cascade laser

23:53.364 --> 23:55.031
or a gyrotron kicking around
anywhere, do you?

23:55.032 --> 23:56.633
Not right on hand, no.

23:56.634 --> 23:57.934
Damn.

23:57.935 --> 23:58.935
Well, I guess
we have to build one.

23:58.936 --> 24:00.770
Not tonight.

24:00.771 --> 24:03.640
Helen, don't you want
to learn the secrets

24:03.641 --> 24:05.275
of the city
your father sent you?

24:05.276 --> 24:06.676
What if it was built

24:06.677 --> 24:08.044
by an entirely new
race of abnormals?

24:08.045 --> 24:09.646
Huh?

24:09.647 --> 24:11.014
You're just content

24:11.015 --> 24:13.349
to roll over
and go back to sleep?

24:13.350 --> 24:15.852
You're genuinely convinced

24:15.853 --> 24:17.620
that you can reactivate
the hologram crystal

24:17.621 --> 24:19.923
by hitting it with
a synchrotronic light source?

24:19.924 --> 24:22.325
No, not reactivate it.

24:22.326 --> 24:24.193
Speak its language.

24:24.194 --> 24:25.695
Show it who's boss.

24:30.134 --> 24:31.267
You are brilliant.

24:32.937 --> 24:33.970
Don't I know it?

24:33.971 --> 24:34.804
Now, get out.

24:34.805 --> 24:35.772
Okay.

24:37.274 --> 24:38.908
Hey... mate.

24:38.909 --> 24:40.176
How's it going?

24:40.177 --> 24:41.210
Dude.

24:41.211 --> 24:44.247
Tickety-boo.

24:44.248 --> 24:45.949
So, it seems to me

24:45.950 --> 24:46.950
you're not
the only one in here

24:46.951 --> 24:48.251
who likes to tinker.

24:48.252 --> 24:50.787
Well, Lucy there

24:50.788 --> 24:52.155
is a demon
with model trains.

24:52.156 --> 24:54.357
Jerry's a rocketry
enthusiast.

24:54.358 --> 24:55.992
James can rebuild
a broken pocket watch

24:55.993 --> 24:57.293
faster than you can
solve a Rubik's cube,

24:57.294 --> 25:00.964
and he plays
a wicked keyboard.

25:00.965 --> 25:02.198
[Chuckles in delight]

25:02.199 --> 25:04.233
Okay, so listen,

25:04.234 --> 25:06.970
I just found out
that we're all, uh...

25:06.971 --> 25:08.004
Part of a clan.

25:10.074 --> 25:12.842
Lycans.

25:12.843 --> 25:14.210
Yeah. Yeah...

25:14.211 --> 25:15.878
I feel like we've all got
something in common.

25:15.879 --> 25:17.680
You know, kind of like
we're all wired

25:17.681 --> 25:19.115
the same way.

25:19.116 --> 25:20.650
What, you mean, like,
fixing stuff?

25:20.651 --> 25:21.718
Yeah.

25:21.719 --> 25:22.819
Doesn't everyone do that?

25:22.820 --> 25:25.221
E-everyone out there? No.

25:26.290 --> 25:28.257
No, I think

25:28.258 --> 25:30.226
that's part of
the Lycan package.

25:30.227 --> 25:31.828
You know, that
and the changing.

25:31.829 --> 25:34.697
No, th-that's not...
No, we don't...

25:34.698 --> 25:36.299
Not ever?

25:36.300 --> 25:37.266
We're in
treatment.

25:37.267 --> 25:38.968
You don't have to worry.

25:38.969 --> 25:40.303
I'm not worried--

25:40.304 --> 25:41.404
we're in treatment,
and it works!

25:41.405 --> 25:42.972
I understand that--

25:42.973 --> 25:45.041
Henry...
Why don't you and I talk?

25:46.176 --> 25:48.144
Privately?

25:56.420 --> 25:59.355
There are certain things
you don't understand yet.

25:59.356 --> 26:01.424
Yeah, like
what kind of drugs

26:01.425 --> 26:03.259
are we actually
taking?

26:03.260 --> 26:05.094
Some sort of
Diazepam cocktail?

26:05.095 --> 26:05.995
You know about it?

26:05.996 --> 26:07.797
Yeah, I tried it.
It's no answer.

26:07.798 --> 26:09.098
It's the only answer

26:09.099 --> 26:10.967
to keep that thing
from coming out.

26:10.968 --> 26:14.103
Okay, Erika,
you can control it.

26:14.104 --> 26:15.805
You don't have to
keep hiding in here.

26:15.806 --> 26:17.874
I'm not hiding.
This is my home.

26:17.875 --> 26:19.175
Is it really?

26:19.176 --> 26:20.977
Where are your parents?

26:22.346 --> 26:24.681
They died in a car crash
shortly after I was born.

26:24.682 --> 26:28.818
Aunt Lillian
took me in.

26:28.819 --> 26:30.787
So what about
the transformation?

26:30.788 --> 26:32.355
[Scoffing]: No.

26:32.356 --> 26:33.823
No, never?

26:33.824 --> 26:35.024
You don't even know
what it's like?

26:35.025 --> 26:36.826
Of course not.

26:36.827 --> 26:38.728
I'm in treatment as well.

26:38.729 --> 26:40.096
Okay, look,
I got to admit,

26:40.097 --> 26:42.732
at first, it-it was
a little scary for me too,

26:42.733 --> 26:44.801
but once you get the hang of it,
it's pretty awesome.

26:46.403 --> 26:47.937
No.

26:47.938 --> 26:50.073
I could never be
one of those things.

26:50.074 --> 26:51.207
It's not
a thing, Erika.

26:51.208 --> 26:52.742
It's who we are.

26:52.743 --> 26:55.278
Not if we want to be safe.

26:55.279 --> 26:56.212
[Snarling]

26:56.213 --> 26:57.146
[Gasps in fright]

27:08.892 --> 27:10.793
How did you do that?

27:10.794 --> 27:12.295
You see?

27:12.296 --> 27:14.397
You don't have to be afraid.
I'm totally in control.

27:18.202 --> 27:19.435
Um...

27:20.738 --> 27:22.004
Oh!

27:22.005 --> 27:23.406
Oh, God.

27:23.407 --> 27:25.274
Uh, I didn't really
think that far ahead.

27:26.910 --> 27:27.810
Uh...

27:27.811 --> 27:29.479
Boy, that's a little awkward.

27:32.883 --> 27:34.984
You see?

27:34.985 --> 27:35.985
It likes it.

27:35.986 --> 27:37.086
Apparently so.

27:37.087 --> 27:39.088
Now fasten
your seatbelt.

27:39.089 --> 27:42.125
[Device thrums]

27:46.363 --> 27:47.864
[Snaps fingers] Ha!

27:47.865 --> 27:49.298
That's right,
surrender your secrets

27:49.299 --> 27:52.001
to the master
of electricity.

27:52.002 --> 27:53.202
Nicely done, Nikola.

27:53.203 --> 27:54.871
Thank you.

27:54.872 --> 27:56.139
More Sumerian script.

27:56.140 --> 27:57.807
This could take
weeks to translate.

27:57.808 --> 28:00.443
Or we could just...

28:00.444 --> 28:02.211
Pull the handle.

28:02.212 --> 28:05.448
[Energy dips and surges]

28:05.449 --> 28:06.549
Seems to be
scanning us.

28:08.318 --> 28:10.153
Akhkharu?

28:10.154 --> 28:11.821
"Blood demon?"

28:11.822 --> 28:13.156
How do you know that symbol?

28:13.157 --> 28:15.558
Well, my race has been
blasphemed for centuries,

28:15.559 --> 28:16.893
but the point is,

28:16.894 --> 28:18.861
it seems to think
I'm still a vampire.

28:18.862 --> 28:20.563
Uh-oh.

28:20.564 --> 28:21.864
Not just you.

28:21.865 --> 28:23.866
Us.

28:23.867 --> 28:26.202
It must be detecting traces
of the source blood in our DNA.

28:27.805 --> 28:29.205
I'm not sure
that's a good thing.

28:38.482 --> 28:40.216
Hey...

28:40.217 --> 28:42.952
I didn't mean
to upset you earlier.

28:42.953 --> 28:45.488
That's okay.

28:45.489 --> 28:48.291
You're new.

28:48.292 --> 28:51.160
After a while,
you'll understand.

28:51.161 --> 28:52.328
Yeah, I don't know.

28:52.329 --> 28:53.362
I might not be
sticking around.

28:53.363 --> 28:55.264
Where would you go?

28:56.433 --> 28:57.867
Out there.

28:59.169 --> 29:01.204
You know, you--
all of you--

29:01.205 --> 29:03.005
you could live
in the real world.

29:03.006 --> 29:04.140
You could be anything you want,

29:04.141 --> 29:07.343
be engineers,
musicians, surfers.

29:07.344 --> 29:08.878
But what about
when the change happens?

29:08.879 --> 29:12.014
Well, then it happens.

29:12.015 --> 29:12.982
You learn to deal with it.

29:14.318 --> 29:15.351
These treatments
you're taking,

29:15.352 --> 29:16.452
they can be
modified.

29:16.453 --> 29:17.587
The Sanctuary can
help you with that.

29:17.588 --> 29:18.888
The treatments
are the only thing

29:18.889 --> 29:20.289
keeping us all
from becoming monsters.

29:23.894 --> 29:25.194
Monsters?

29:25.195 --> 29:26.562
If you go
off-treatment,

29:26.563 --> 29:28.464
when the change hits,
there's no controlling it.

29:31.001 --> 29:34.403
Is that what
happened to Liam?

29:34.404 --> 29:36.205
Liam thought
what you think,

29:36.206 --> 29:39.442
that we can live the old way.

29:39.443 --> 29:42.945
Then he turned into...
The thing,

29:42.946 --> 29:46.215
murdered Joe.

29:48.118 --> 29:49.518
I don't want to be that.

29:51.255 --> 29:54.490
Yeah, but you're wrong.
You won't.

29:54.491 --> 29:57.627
Yeah, when you change,
you become...

29:57.628 --> 30:00.263
Wild, maybe.

30:00.264 --> 30:03.499
It's like a version of yourself
that burns hotter than usual.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.600
You don't become a killer.

30:04.601 --> 30:08.471
Yeah. You do.

30:08.472 --> 30:10.973
Liam did,

30:10.974 --> 30:12.642
and Josephine,

30:12.643 --> 30:15.211
two years ago.

30:15.212 --> 30:17.480
That were
right in the dayroom here.

30:17.481 --> 30:19.949
We all saw...

30:22.019 --> 30:25.922
That's why
we have to stay here.

30:25.923 --> 30:27.957
That's why we all have to
take the treatment,

30:27.958 --> 30:30.626
even you.

30:30.627 --> 30:32.028
Otherwise, we're just beasts.

30:33.630 --> 30:36.232
Henry, I'm confused.

30:36.233 --> 30:37.934
Yeah, join the club.

30:37.935 --> 30:40.336
This isn't a refuge.
This is a prison.

30:40.337 --> 30:42.471
I beg your pardon?

30:42.472 --> 30:44.106

Including turning them
into killers?

Haps don't kill.

30:58.989 --> 31:00.289
Except for
the ones in here.

31:00.290 --> 31:02.191

I know what they're afraid of.

I've made sure they understand

31:12.469 --> 31:14.337
the horror of
their true nature, yes.

31:14.338 --> 31:16.939
Seeing what happened to Liam
and the others

31:18.241 --> 31:20.643
why we lock
that part of ourselves away.

What are you
giving these people

31:25.615 --> 31:27.083
so that when they turn hap

31:27.084 --> 31:29.118
they kill
whoever's in front of them?

31:34.624 --> 31:36.058
I thought you
belonged here, Henry,

everything I've built.

No, I won't let you do this.

true nature

31:55.078 --> 31:57.046

your monster, Henry.

32:13.774 --> 32:15.241

accelerator.

Which means we could be
in imminent danger.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.080
Well, we have to
stop it

32:21.081 --> 32:22.715

Okay, the particle track

sufficient energy.

Boom.

32:35.362 --> 32:36.662

I can try.

we face it together.

said vows.

Whatever this is,
it's intent on keeping us out.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.460
At least
it's more creative

33:07.461 --> 33:08.461

and holy water.

33:08.462 --> 33:11.297
If we eliminate the threat,

take your hand

Right.
