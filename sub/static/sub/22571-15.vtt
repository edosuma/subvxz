WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:02.736
- So, here's what I wanna do,
babe.

00:02.836 --> 00:04.072
We're going
to Hawaiian Gardens.

00:04.172 --> 00:05.806
- Yeah.
- You know how, like,

00:05.906 --> 00:07.007
when you go to Hawaii
on vacation

00:07.108 --> 00:08.276
and how you just
step off the airplane

00:08.376 --> 00:09.443
and you get a kiss--
- They greet them.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.213
- They get a lei.
- Ooh, I love it!

00:12.313 --> 00:14.082
Aloha!
Ow, ow, oh.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.716
I just stuck my finger
in my eye.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.085
- Okay, don't do that.
Use the fingers,

00:17.185 --> 00:18.752
but like this.
Aloha.

00:18.852 --> 00:19.853
- Aloha!

00:20.588 --> 00:23.357
Once you pay the lady,
you're getting lei'd.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.264
male narrator: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:30.364 --> 00:31.899
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:31.999 --> 00:34.335
- Next one!
- The treasures within...

00:34.435 --> 00:36.070
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.405
narrator:
Are put up for auction.

00:37.505 --> 00:38.739
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:38.839 --> 00:40.441
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:40.541 --> 00:41.975
- You shut your face.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.145
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.313
- We're back, baby!

00:50.050 --> 00:51.352
What's up, schmuck?

00:51.452 --> 00:54.422
I like your hair.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.824
You just get out the shower?
- Yeah, I did, Chia Pet.

00:56.924 --> 00:58.692
- How do I look
like a Chia Pet?

00:58.792 --> 01:00.394
- Come on, Brandle.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.795
- Yep.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.564
- You glued that on
this morning.

01:03.664 --> 01:07.568
- Hey, this is all natural.
- Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Chia Pet.

01:07.668 --> 01:08.836
- I would make fun
of your hair,

01:08.936 --> 01:10.404
but you don't have
much of it, though.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.005
You're looking like the
roadrunner on your shirt there.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.643
- What do you think these
dummies are talking about?

01:15.743 --> 01:17.145
- They're talking about
Darrell's hair.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.312
- Your hair looks like
you were, like,

01:18.412 --> 01:19.580
walking on the carpet
like this,

01:19.680 --> 01:20.881
and your hair just started
to flame up.

01:20.981 --> 01:23.317
- Makes sense.
Thinning out a little bit.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.153
- Ooh.
- You're due for a trim.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.454
Look at that stuff
sticking out.

01:26.554 --> 01:27.521
This is some pretty good

01:27.621 --> 01:29.022
hair right here.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.259
- Yes.
- It's a wig, first of all.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.060
- I think Darrell's been
wearing that same tank top

01:33.161 --> 01:34.362
since the beginning
of this show.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.164
- I was gonna try
to teach 'im.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.399
You always wanna get in here
before these other guys

01:38.499 --> 01:41.502
and go in and ask the managers
how many units

01:41.602 --> 01:43.103
and is there anything
special?

01:43.204 --> 01:44.972
Is there anything
that stands out?"

01:45.072 --> 01:46.607
- Well, see, you gotta be
one step ahead of the game.

01:46.707 --> 01:47.908
You have to call and do that.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.277
- Let me tell you something.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.511
I call all the time,
and they don't have time

01:50.611 --> 01:51.612
to talk to you.
- That's the difference

01:51.712 --> 01:52.613
between me and you, though.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.847
Everyone always has
time for me.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.349
- Here's the thing about
know-it-alls.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.717
They don't know nothing.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.386
That's where I come in.

01:58.486 --> 02:01.689
Tie your shoe, dude.
What are you looking at?

02:01.789 --> 02:03.157
You looked down.
- I didn't look down.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.593
- Dude, you looked down.
- No, my eyes were gazing

02:05.693 --> 02:07.561
to go that way.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.264
What are you looking for today?

02:10.364 --> 02:11.932
- Money.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.701
- Yeah.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.703
Just like a pile of money?
- Yeah, just a pile of money.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.205
- Just like a pile of money,
and then you gouge everybody's

02:17.305 --> 02:18.606
eyes out and tell them
how trashy it is,

02:18.706 --> 02:20.441
and you buy it for a buck,
and we go down the road?

02:20.541 --> 02:21.975
- Exactly.
- I like your way of thinking.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.511
- Yeah.
- Doesn't sound like I'm

02:23.611 --> 02:25.246
gonna make much commission.
All right!

02:25.346 --> 02:27.515
Welcome to Hawaiian Gardens.
We're Dan and Laura Dotson,

02:27.615 --> 02:29.317
American auctioneers
at storageauctions.net.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.584
Before you go through
these gates,

02:30.684 --> 02:32.052
you need to know the rules.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.621
We're gonna go to the unit.
We're gonna remove the lock.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.323
We're gonna give you five
minutes to take a look around.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.191
You can't go inside.
And who's ever got the most

02:37.291 --> 02:38.892
money in their pocket
can own it today.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.961
Are you ready?

02:41.061 --> 02:42.863
Beautiful!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

02:42.963 --> 02:45.098
- It's auction time!
Let's go!

02:47.067 --> 02:49.503
- Come on, boys and girls.
This is where it's at.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.639
Right here.
Come on, Brandi.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.841
You're just walking all cocky
and everything.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.976
- Yeah, you're walking cocky.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.445
- You are.
- She said if--

02:57.545 --> 02:58.912
if we have one and it's got
a pile of cash in it,

02:59.012 --> 03:00.180
she's in.
- That's right.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.749
- That's it.

03:01.849 --> 03:02.850
- Cash.
- I don't like to work

03:02.950 --> 03:03.851
for my money.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.922
- Whoo-hoo!
Welcome to Hawaiian Gardens,

03:09.022 --> 03:10.424
folks!
- Oh, everything you need

03:10.524 --> 03:11.759
if this is what
you're looking for.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.026
I have got it right here.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.663
*

03:15.763 --> 03:18.999
- Oh, my God.
Aah!

03:19.099 --> 03:20.768
I'm putting that right
in the back of the Jag.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.870
I'm taking out the whole
backseat for that thing.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.738
What does that say?
- "Love God."

03:24.838 --> 03:27.040
- Yep.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.942
- Thank you.
- This is nice.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.179
Got some furniture in there.
A couple tubs.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.914
This interests me how the put
a lock on this cabinet.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.849
So might be something
good in there.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.518
*

03:37.618 --> 03:41.489
- Oh, look at that PA speaker.
Well, those are the cheap ones.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.091
Pro Studios.
They got some shelves in here

03:44.191 --> 03:46.894
and stuff like that.
Got a desk and a metal cabinet.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.297
- Ooh! Don't be touching
that unit!

03:49.397 --> 03:51.031
- Same goes to you, Laura!

03:52.666 --> 03:53.634
- All right, here we go.
Number 20.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.871
25

03:57.971 --> 03:59.239
I got 50 there.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.909
- 100!
125.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.544
125 there.
150 where?

04:03.644 --> 04:04.778
150 here.
- I don't want it.

04:04.878 --> 04:05.779
I just have to get there.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.815
- Jesus.
- Yeah!

04:07.915 --> 04:08.816
- 150 here.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.784
175, 175 now.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.556
225, 250, 250 now.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.591
I get you at 225.
250 going once.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.092
250, 250 going twice.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.061
Last and final call
at 250...

04:21.161 --> 04:23.263
Sold it your way, $225,
Jarrod.

04:23.364 --> 04:26.467
I'm taking out the front seat

04:26.567 --> 04:27.635
and putting the speaker
right there.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.870
You're gonna have to sit
in the back.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.372
- Right this way, folks.
Two more units.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.940
Let's go!

04:33.040 --> 04:34.742
- Can't believe I let Jarrod
get those speakers.

04:34.842 --> 04:35.743
- Oh!

04:35.843 --> 04:37.511
- He's loud enough as it is.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.246
- Oh, we're gonna kill it.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.118
- Hey, can you stop making
so much noise?

04:45.218 --> 04:46.587
- It's the money.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.391
What the...

04:50.491 --> 04:52.426
- This is full of trash.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.094
- I'm pretty sure.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.797
- I don't know.
The cabinet is worth money.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.166
- Cabinet, sure.
40 bucks.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.234
*

05:01.335 --> 05:03.404
Oh, that looks good.
- Yeah.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.038
- Looks like a harness
and a safety line.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.173
- Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

05:06.273 --> 05:08.409
- Probably 50 bucks.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.843
Oh.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.612
Oh, what is this?

05:11.712 --> 05:13.313
*

05:13.414 --> 05:15.549
Paper.
Polygraph.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.719
- Ooh.
Yeah, I guess.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.354
What do you think
about these shelves?

05:20.454 --> 05:22.155
40 bucks apiece or something?

05:22.255 --> 05:23.691
*

05:23.791 --> 05:26.494
- Sure, 40 bucks times four.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.963
- All right.
- Oh, my, God.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.999
- I found it.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.867
*

05:33.967 --> 05:34.868
It's right there.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.471
*

05:37.571 --> 05:39.172
- It's the receiver

05:39.272 --> 05:40.841
to power the speakers!

05:40.941 --> 05:43.844
Whoo!
Look at that .

05:43.944 --> 05:45.713
Oh, my God.
The neighbors are never

05:45.813 --> 05:49.182
gonna talk to us again.
- They don't talk to us anyway.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.819
- One more cabinet.

05:51.919 --> 05:55.222
There's a chop saw...
There's a

05:55.322 --> 05:59.927
Flashlight...

06:00.027 --> 06:01.361
- Oh, Brandi.
What is this?
Oh, Brandi.
Wh

06:02.763 --> 06:05.065
What is it?
- Ooh.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.299
- Damn, it's heavy.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.201
*

06:09.837 --> 06:11.271
*

06:11.371 --> 06:12.640
Whoa. What is this?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.174
- Oh, my God!

06:14.274 --> 06:16.444
No way.
If that's a lie detector,

06:16.544 --> 06:18.712
I'm gonna tell you right now,
you're not hooking me up to it.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.748
- Come here.
- Out of the question.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.850
- Let me see your hand.
Let me see your wrist.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.151
Let me see it.
Let me see it.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.553
How often do you masturbate?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.223
- All right.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.324
- Because--

06:31.425 --> 06:32.893
- Do you have something
to hide?

06:32.993 --> 06:34.962
- Look at where you started.
Where do you go from there?

06:35.062 --> 06:37.498
Look at this thing
.

06:37.598 --> 06:41.101
It's a Mini-Graph,
whatever that means.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.903
See what I did there?
- Mmm-hmm.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.371
- Let's set it aside.
We'll come back to it.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.440
- Okay.
What about the speakers?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.576
- They look amazing,
but I looked them up.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.944
They're going for, like,
200 bucks, used.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.714
- Plus, uh, whatever that lie
detector's gonna get us.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.716
- We definitely have to get
that checked out separately.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.887
*

06:59.987 --> 07:01.689
- And now we're gonna
find out the truth.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.824
If I find out I'm not the
father of those kids,

07:03.924 --> 07:05.526
I swear to God...

07:07.260 --> 07:09.730
You are not the father.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.600
- It's supposed to be
a 7 1/2x10, but...

07:12.700 --> 07:15.536
- I think it's 10x4.
- Yeah.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.270
And for years,
I'm telling you.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.640
Exaggerate it's bigger
when it's really smaller.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.277
This is a 6-inch pan."
- I don't wanna know.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.814
- He goes, "Babe,
It's a 3-inch pan."

07:29.016 --> 07:30.918
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.587
- All right,
there we go!

07:33.687 --> 07:35.288
Whoo!

07:35.388 --> 07:37.257
*

07:37.357 --> 07:38.959
Oh, I like it.
I like it.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.496
- Yeah, I gotta push you

07:42.596 --> 07:44.197
out of the way.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.367
- Oh, my God, Brandi.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.503
Dan, that was not my fault,
but sorry.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.471
- That's okay.
It actually feels

07:51.572 --> 07:53.373
really refreshing.
- I'm sorry.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.042
- Thank you.
You're not sorry.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.044
cool move right there.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.546
- She just said,
"Sorry, not sorry."

07:58.646 --> 08:01.549
- I hope you don't get anything
for Christmas this year.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.951
- Looks like a lot of little
decorator stuff.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.419
A radio.
A colander.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.388
Very interesting.
This might be something

08:08.488 --> 08:10.157
I go on.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.324
- Of course I know
what that is.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.760
- It's a record player.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.695
There's some giant
chonies right there.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.830
- Mmm.
- I think that's mostly

08:16.930 --> 08:18.365
what this is.
- Smells like a lot of clothes.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.000
- It's a lot of clothes.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.569
- Nice little sound system
right here.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.904
A lot of boxes.
Uh, clothes.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.840
That's actually a nice case.
Alaska Airlines.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.742
These guys have money
to fly out to Alaska.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.711
Should be some good things
in this unit, then.

08:30.811 --> 08:31.945
- What an idiot.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.380
- All right,
if you're ready to go,

08:33.480 --> 08:34.582
I'm ready to go,
how much money?

08:34.682 --> 08:36.784
How 'bout $50...
50 where?

08:36.884 --> 08:39.186
50 now, 50 bucks?
- 50 bucks!

08:39.286 --> 08:40.654
- 50 bucks there.
75 where?

08:40.754 --> 08:41.922
- Yeah!
- 75 there.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.256
- 100 bucks.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.558
- 100 there.
- Yeah!

08:46.359 --> 08:47.661
150?
150?

08:47.761 --> 08:50.097
172, now 200.
- Well, everybody wants it now.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.099
Yeah.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.400
- Yeah.
- And 225, 250.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.467
- Yeah.
- 250, 75...

08:54.568 --> 08:55.636
- Yep.
- 300, 300.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.237
300 where?
- 300, 300!

08:57.337 --> 08:59.607
- And 325, and 25.
325.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.676
- All right, let's do it!

09:02.776 --> 09:05.178
350, 375 going once, twice.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.515
Solid it your way, Darrell.
Got it for $350, Darrell.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.952
- There's some brand new
panties in there, too.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.654
- Yeah.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.189
Still got the tags on them.
- All right, lock it up.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.290
Next case.
Let's go!

09:17.390 --> 09:18.726
*

09:18.826 --> 09:20.828
- Dan, we spilled water
everywhere, Dan.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.797
- Yeah.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.533
- Oh, candy wrapper.

09:26.634 --> 09:27.868
- I kind of like it.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.904
You look good in plastic.
- Saran Wrap.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.141
- Oh, there it is.
Oh, ah!

09:34.241 --> 09:36.744
God, why did you hit me?
You guys got that, right?

09:36.844 --> 09:38.078
You got that?
I swear to God,

09:38.178 --> 09:39.479
I'll need that for
the divorce.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.715
*

09:41.815 --> 09:44.351
- All right.
Whoo!

09:44.451 --> 09:46.787
I think this unit screams,
"Hope."

09:46.887 --> 09:48.922
*

09:49.022 --> 09:51.091
- Mattresses.
- It's a bunch of mattresses.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.592
I mean, hey, at least they
kept them covered.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.895
- That's true.
- It's a bedroom unit.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.163
- Mmm-mmm.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.530
- Mmm-mmm.
And you know

09:57.631 --> 09:59.700
I don't like mattresses.
- Mattresses from here.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.601
- Hey, I--I--I--

10:01.702 --> 10:02.602
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

10:02.703 --> 10:03.804
- I'm good on this one.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.973
- Ooh, I'll give you
seven reasons

10:06.073 --> 10:07.675
why I don't want this locker.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.077
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.512
Those mattresses,
they're not worth the time.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.081
Hey, look at that, though.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.849
But Justin's young.
He's got plenty

10:15.949 --> 10:17.150
of time to burn.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.653
No doubt he should burn
the mattresses.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.489
Dude, complete bedroom set.
You're gonna thank me

10:22.589 --> 10:24.291
if you get this.
- All right.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.525
- All right,
I got a nice little

10:25.625 --> 10:27.160
bedroom unit.
Here we go, how much money?

10:27.260 --> 10:28.428
What are you gonna pay?
- I'll give you 10.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.130
- I got 10.
25.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.734
25 where?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.168
Bid 25.
- No.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.337
25. Got a
washer and dryer in there.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.773
- Ooh, there's a washer and
dryer in there, babe.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.608
You could wash the sheets,
put them back on the bed.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.176
- 25!

10:43.276 --> 10:45.178
Are you 25?
Wanna bid 35?

10:45.278 --> 10:49.549
- Yeah.
35, 45 now.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.384
- I get 35, 45,
get 35...

10:51.484 --> 10:52.619
Come on, chicken.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.487
- You're out. $40.
- Thank God.

10:54.587 --> 10:55.956
- 40 bucks.
40 going once.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.590
I got 35, 40 going twice.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.860
40 bucks,
all through, all done.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.462
Justin, your way.
$35.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.297
- Score, Chia Pet.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.367
You'll thank me later.
I'm serious.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.069
Sucker.
- Whoo!

11:09.169 --> 11:10.170
That's the end of the sale,
folks.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.471
And don't forget
to pay the lady.

11:11.571 --> 11:12.472
Thank you, everyone!

11:12.572 --> 11:13.941
- That's the end of the sale,
folks.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.209
And don't forget to pay
Jarrod!

11:16.309 --> 11:17.377
- You gotta put your hand
on your waist.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.612
- Wait, wrong leg.
Wait, wait.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.849
That way.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.985
- I think Darrell might have
dropped this one on me.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.253
This locker better
make me some

11:26.353 --> 11:27.721
* Mo-mo-mo-money

11:27.821 --> 11:30.257
All right. Is that a $2 bill?

11:30.357 --> 11:35.195
Yeah.
Money, money, money.

11:35.295 --> 11:39.699
Ooh, a dollar coin.
Ooh, another dollar coin.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.768
Is there another one?
Is there another one?

11:40.868 --> 11:42.903
Yeah.

11:43.003 --> 11:46.974
Oh, handkerchiefs for dogs.
Some leashes.

11:47.074 --> 11:50.744
And then for this one here,
I'd put this one at 30 bucks.

11:50.844 --> 11:53.080
Household items.
Some pots and pans.

11:53.180 --> 11:56.049
So we got a big pile
of nothing.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.285
This actually looks
pretty nice.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.620
I sell bedroom sets super easy.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.222
So if the whole bedroom
set's in there,

12:02.322 --> 12:04.257
you know, I'll easily make
money off that.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.693
So this one is actually
pretty good.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.763
No tears.
We got a second one here.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.564
The plush right here
is actually really clean.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.433
So it's getting better.
It's getting better.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.434
We're getting there.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.307
Oh, look at that.
Look at this thing.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.442
This is freaking gross.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.044
Ooh, that smells like urine.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.512
It looks like
it's all stained up.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.214
Oh, man.
Looks like my dogs

12:27.314 --> 12:29.282
peed on this thing.
Come to my mattress store.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.617
We have stained beds
here and there.

12:30.717 --> 12:33.253
We'll give it to you for
$99,099.99, plus tax.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.988
Or your mattress is free!

12:36.689 --> 12:38.391
Come on.
Storage gods,

12:38.491 --> 12:39.626
give me something here.

12:39.726 --> 12:44.064
What is this thing?
What is this?

12:44.164 --> 12:47.634
What the heck?
This thing is cool.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.436
This is, like,
for your dogs.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.906
I have no idea how much
something like this is worth.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.475
In California, people don't
treat their dogs like dogs.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.877
Take this down
to Beverly Hills.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.245
Oh, I'm pretty sure someone
will pay a fortune

12:58.345 --> 13:00.347
for this thing.
So I'll put this to the side

13:00.447 --> 13:01.949
and definitely get this
thing checked out.

13:03.683 --> 13:07.720
What the--These things are
actually really, really nice.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.023
All they need is
a nice wipe down.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.092
These things are in pretty
damn good condition.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.061
These are one of
the newer ones, too.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.764
I can easily pull a good $350
off the washer and dryer.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.732
This looks like the rest
of the bed set.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.269
Got the side rails here.
So it looks like we actually

13:22.369 --> 13:25.172
have a complete bed.
It actually looks pretty clean.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.877
And it's trying to kill me.

13:29.977 --> 13:34.181
For both the bed sets,
that's a easy $300 on this.

13:34.281 --> 13:37.250
I made a nice chunk of change.
So I really can't complain.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.452
Except for the mattresses.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.155
*

13:43.690 --> 13:44.757
Kill me now.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.661
- I think I got the best
locker of the day.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.031
I always think that.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.300
You know why I know this
is the best unit?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.102
No mattresses.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.570
Think I'll start
right over here.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.473
These little decorator pots.

14:00.573 --> 14:04.144
Those things are easy
10 bucks apiece.

14:04.244 --> 14:07.347
Old antique hat box.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.616
Please be in there.
Please.

14:09.716 --> 14:13.086
Anyways, 5 bucks on
the little hat box.

14:13.186 --> 14:17.124
Ooh, beautiful cross.
That's really, really nice.

14:17.224 --> 14:21.061
Ooh, another one.
That's an easy 40 on that one.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.863
25 on that one.
All day long.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.367
Super nice vintage
collectable lamp.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.370
Looks like it might be
from the '50s.

14:30.470 --> 14:34.374
I'll turn that into a $35-bill
right there no problem.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.544
Wow, this thing put the "H"
in "heavy" right here.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.180
30 bucks for this all day long.

14:40.280 --> 14:44.717
Oh, we just hit the mother one.
I haven't gotten one of these

14:44.817 --> 14:49.322
in years.
This is an armadillo purse.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.192
How much as it is?
100 bucks on the online market.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.663
Huh.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.499
These are, uh, fedoras or
whatever they're called.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.702
Made in VA China.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.437
Vachina.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.873
10 bucks apiece.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.776
Wow!
That's a nice little violin.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.478
With the case,
I'm thinking this

15:11.578 --> 15:14.314
is an easy 250 bucks
right here.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.783
This is one of those little
reproduction record players.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.586
Get 45 bucks for them.

15:19.686 --> 15:23.923
This is still really cool.
A spelter knights in armor.

15:24.024 --> 15:27.760
However, it's 40 bucks all day
long hanging on the wall.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.530
Binoculars? Every box,
there's one good thing in it.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.565
That's 20 bucks right there.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.601
A speakerphone.
It's pretty cool, though.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.404
This thing's gotta
be worth 20 bucks, no problem.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.772
Juicy Couture purse.
So I'll get 20 bucks

15:39.872 --> 15:41.474
for that purse all day.

15:41.574 --> 15:44.711
Voila.
Ooh, this is cool.

15:44.811 --> 15:48.815
Little battery operated...

15:48.915 --> 15:51.951
Bird whistler.
That might be worth 100 bucks.

15:53.753 --> 15:59.292
This is that Bose.
Whoo!

15:59.392 --> 16:01.194
- Bose, please be in here.
Bose!
Please b

16:01.294 --> 16:05.932
Oh, my God!
I got Laura's hair extensions

16:06.033 --> 16:08.368
in here!

16:08.468 --> 16:10.370
And they're clip-on,
just like she wears.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.507
Halloween stuff.
There's probably 40 bucks.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.744
It looks like I've about
tripled my money here.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.013
Not too shabby.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.515
Great.
Perfume called Happy Ending.

16:22.615 --> 16:23.750
Ah, dang it.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.323
I'm here at the California
Animal Rehabilitation Center

16:30.423 --> 16:32.225
to meet Dr. Waldman
and Adrian Gross.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.993
How you doing?
- Good, I'm Adrian.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.096
Dr. Waldman's right around
this corner.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.299
- To see if I can sniff out
a profit on my dog treadmill.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.101
- Dr. Waldman.
Nice to meet you.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.669
Welcome.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.238
- This is Sneakers.
- Hello!

16:45.338 --> 16:46.573
- Oh, no, don't bite me.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.042
- She does a little barking
at the beginning.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.111
Give her this.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.680
And everything gets better.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.615
- All right, so, I'm here
to get this pet run thing

16:55.715 --> 16:57.450
checked out.
- Okay.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.520
This is a dog treadmill.
And we might use this

17:00.620 --> 17:03.356
for pet rehabilitation.
We see a lot of pets here

17:03.456 --> 17:06.459
that have been paralyzed
or they had a surgery

17:06.559 --> 17:09.028
and they just don't walk
the right way anymore.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.597
- So, dogs are pretty
much like humans.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.200
- Dogs are pretty much
like people but cuter.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.801
- I think Sneakers here
likes the machine.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.869
- I think Sneakers wants to see
if it's gonna work.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.605
- All right, moment of truth.
- Okay.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.076
- And it works.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.112
Okay.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.613
- All right.
- Oh, my Gosh.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.614
- Whoo!
What?

17:27.714 --> 17:30.350
- Good, Sneakie!

17:30.450 --> 17:32.552
Yay, that was good!

17:32.652 --> 17:34.687
- I think I found a buyer.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.556
I think you might have
found a buyer.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.925
- So, uh, what can I get
for this thing?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.027
- Well, you know,
one of these new

17:41.128 --> 17:43.296
if it were perfect--
which it's not--

17:43.396 --> 17:47.467
could go for about $600.
However, we do see a little

17:47.567 --> 17:49.736
duct tape over here.
I do see a little

17:49.836 --> 17:53.039
bit of dust.
I'd say in this condition...

17:55.308 --> 17:57.444
You're looking at about 250.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.113
That's more than what I spent

18:00.213 --> 18:01.881
on the unit itself.
So, you know what?

18:01.981 --> 18:04.951
I'm gonna go buy some doggy
treats with that money.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.186
- Great.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.323
- I'm nervous.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.492
- I don't know why.
My palms are sweating.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.529
- That's--That's your--
- Secret knock.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.030
- That's your big knock--
Oh, it's a secret knock?

18:18.131 --> 18:19.899
- Yes, it's a restricted area.
You gotta know the knock.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.869
- Hi.
- Brandi!

18:22.969 --> 18:24.504
- Hey, you must be John.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.540
- Meeting with John Odum at
the Marston Polygraph Academy

18:27.640 --> 18:30.677
to find the true value
of this polygraph machine.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.212
- Go ahead and place
it right there.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.614
- All right. I don't know if
you guys are feeling it too,

18:34.714 --> 18:36.449
but my heart
is racing right now.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.918
- Everybody that takes
a polygraph is nervous.

18:39.018 --> 18:41.354
We expect that
from healthy people.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.756
- Okay. Honest people.
- Yes.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.358
- People that have nothing
to hide.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.294
- There you go.
This is a...

18:47.394 --> 18:48.595
a very old polygraph

18:48.695 --> 18:50.497
made in the 1950s.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.132
The instrument maker,
Lafayette Instrument Company,

18:53.233 --> 18:55.101
started around
World War II.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.404
- Lafayette is, uh,

18:57.504 --> 18:59.639
one of the major
polygraph makers.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.841
At the time,
the FBI agent

19:01.941 --> 19:03.876
might be called to fly
to another city,

19:03.976 --> 19:05.645
another state, and he's
gonna be carrying this

19:05.745 --> 19:07.280
on the plane.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.481
- But it is true

19:08.581 --> 19:10.450
that you can learn
to beat these things.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.118
Right?
- Not really.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.587
What we're doing
is monitoring breathing.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.256
We're monitoring
blood pressure.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.457
We're picking up
perspiration,

19:17.557 --> 19:18.758
we're picking up
heart rate.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.393
So the polygraph works

19:20.493 --> 19:22.229
because your body
gives you away.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.096
- So basically,
you can't beat it.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.335
- So for this beautiful
machine we have right here,

19:28.435 --> 19:29.569
what do you think
we can get?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.938
- Well, visually,
it does look very good.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.774
You know, the condition's
very nice.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.243
We're missing
the power cord.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.877
We're missing the blood
pressure tube.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.313
So that's a little bit
of a negative.

19:40.413 --> 19:43.650
So in its present condition
without those accessories,

19:43.750 --> 19:44.684
I would think...

19:46.319 --> 19:47.920
250.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.857
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll take it!

19:50.957 --> 19:52.124
You're telling the truth,
right?

19:52.225 --> 19:53.526
- I am telling the truth.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.362
- Unfortunately, we're not
gonna be able

19:55.462 --> 19:56.996
to see how this thing
works, huh?

19:57.096 --> 19:58.798
- No, because the accessories
are missing.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.433
- Do you have one
that you can show us?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.235
- We do.

20:02.335 --> 20:05.104
narrator: Justin Bryant
unleashed his potential...

20:05.204 --> 20:06.906
and wagged his way

20:07.006 --> 20:08.941
to 900 bones.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.611
Darrell sheets made almost
500 bucks

20:11.711 --> 20:13.646
in ch-ch-change

20:13.746 --> 20:17.083
while Jarrod and Brandle
tested their skills

20:17.183 --> 20:19.852
and made $475,

20:19.952 --> 20:22.289
and that's no lie.

20:24.156 --> 20:25.725
- Do you think you're
a better buyer than me?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.427
- No.
- Have you ever lied

20:27.527 --> 20:28.995
about how much you've
spent on a locker?

20:29.095 --> 20:30.663
- No.
- Are you obsessed with

20:30.763 --> 20:32.064
with Mariah Carey?
- No.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.567
- Do you eat more than
2 gallons of ice cream a week?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.569
- Fifth.
- Did you use the last

20:36.669 --> 20:38.471
of my Lady Face Cream?
- No!

20:38.571 --> 20:39.806
- Do you think Mary's
prettier than me?

20:39.906 --> 20:42.342
- No!

20:42.442 --> 20:44.444
- So, Brandi, it looks
like all lies.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.545
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
