07:50.861 --> 07:52.167
OKAY.GET OUT, GET OUT.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.429
GOD!

07:53.473 --> 07:55.344
I DON'T KNOW--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.476
WHY DO YOU
NEED A BUNK BED?

07:56.519 --> 07:57.868
ARE YOU TRYING
TO LURE MARINES IN HERE,

07:57.912 --> 07:59.261
SO YOU COULD
HOOK UP WITH THEM?

07:59.304 --> 08:00.915
OKAY, THAT'S GROSS.
NO, I'M NOT.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.394
OKAY, GOOD.

08:02.438 --> 08:03.657
THE ONLY WAY TO GET MY BEST
FRIEND TO COME INTO THE CITY

08:03.700 --> 08:05.310
WAS TO MAKE A BUNK BED
FOR HER DAUGHTER.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.835
I HAVE A COUPLE HOURS
BEFORE MY NEXT PATIENT.

08:07.878 --> 08:09.967
I MEAN, I COULD--I COULD
FINISH THIS IN A HALF AN HOUR.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.055
WAIT, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

08:11.099 --> 08:13.101
SURE, THERE'S
A CERTAIN PRIDE YOU GET

08:13.144 --> 08:15.364
IN BUILDING SOMETHING
WITH YOUR OWN TWO HANDS.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.279
WE LOST THAT
AS A COUNTRY.

08:17.322 --> 08:20.325
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,
BUT, DANNY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.588
WHERE ARE THE DIRECTIONS?

08:21.631 --> 08:24.373
HERE YOU GO.

08:24.416 --> 08:25.461
I DON'T DO DIRECTIONS.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.855
OKAY,
THAT WAS A BIT MUCH.

08:27.898 --> 08:28.856
PUT ON SOME MUSIC.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.510
AND NONE
OF YOUR GIRLY STUFF.

08:30.553 --> 08:35.297
THIS MIGHT BE CHALLENGING,
BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT TO DO...

08:35.340 --> 08:38.692
[Light My Candle
from Rentplays]

08:38.735 --> 08:40.520
HEY, WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT THE GIRLY MUSIC?

08:40.563 --> 08:43.174
THIS IS THE MOST MASCULINE
BROADWAY SONG THAT I HAVE.

08:43.218 --> 08:45.481
TURN IT OFF.
I CA--

08:45.525 --> 08:46.917
I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.876
OKAY, I ALSO HAVE
ALAN CUMMING

08:48.919 --> 08:50.442
READING THE AUDIOBOOK
OF LOVELY BONES.

08:50.486 --> 08:51.531
NO.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.271
YOU GOT ANY ZEPPELIN?

08:53.315 --> 08:54.795
WHO?

08:54.838 --> 08:55.926
[Danny]
DO ME A FAVOR.
HOLD THIS--

08:55.970 --> 08:58.929
HOLD THIS STEADY
DOWN THERE.
YUP.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.061
GOT IT?
MM-HMM.

09:00.104 --> 09:02.106
THANK YOU.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.326
SO WHAT'S ON TAP
FOR YOUR BIG WEEKEND

09:04.369 --> 09:06.894
WITH, UH, YOUR FRIEND
AND THE KID?

09:06.937 --> 09:09.592
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I MADE UP AN ITINERARY.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.376
AN ITINERARY?

09:11.420 --> 09:12.552
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
AN ITINERARY.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.292
THAT'S HOW YOU MAXIMIZE
FUN TIME PER HOUR.

09:14.336 --> 09:17.165
OKAY, FIRST, WE'RE GETTING
DIM SUM AT THE GOLDEN UNICORN.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.166
OBVIOUSLY.

09:18.209 --> 09:20.385
OKAY.
THEN WE'RE GOING

09:20.429 --> 09:22.257
TO AN UNDERGROUND SAMPLE SALE
ON PRINCE STREET.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.432
WAIT, DON'T TELL ANYONE.

09:23.475 --> 09:24.520
I'LL DO MY BEST NOT TO.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.304
THEN WE'RE GETTING
MICRODERM FACIALS,

09:26.348 --> 09:27.305
BECAUSE AFTER A MORNING
LIKE THAT,

09:27.349 --> 09:28.306
OUR PORES
ARE GONNA BE A MESS.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.830
IT'S GONNA BE THE BEST.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.353
AND YOU'RE BRINGING
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD KID

09:31.396 --> 09:32.789
TO ALL THAT?

09:32.833 --> 09:36.576
NO, SHE WILL STAY HERE
AND HAVE FUN WITH THE BUNK BED.

09:36.619 --> 09:39.404
I'M GUESSING
THAT YOUR FRIEND

09:39.448 --> 09:42.712
MIGHT ACTUALLY WANT
TO SPEND TIME WITH HER DAUGHTER.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.148
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
DANNY,

09:44.192 --> 09:45.715
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT CHILDREN.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.195
I DON'T?
NO, I MEAN,

09:47.238 --> 09:48.631
YOU COME FROM THE GENERATION
WHERE THE ADULTS JUST, LIKE,

09:48.675 --> 09:50.241
LET THE KIDS
DO WHATEVER THEY WANT,

09:50.285 --> 09:51.721
SO THEY COULD SMOKE POT
AND GO TO KEY PARTIES.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.462
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
WE'RE FROM THE SAME GENERATION.

09:53.505 --> 09:54.681
NO, WE ARE NOT,
FOR THE LAST TI--

09:54.724 --> 09:55.725
SECOND OF ALL,
I KNOW A LOT ABOUT KIDS--

09:55.769 --> 09:57.248
A LOT ABOUT KIDS,
'CAUSE I BASICALLY

09:57.292 --> 09:58.423
RAISED MY LITTLE
BROTHER RICHIE.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.121
YOU DID?
YEAH.

10:00.164 --> 10:02.471
BROTHERS
RAISING BROTHERS?

10:02.514 --> 10:03.907
THAT IS SO CATHOLIC,
DANNY.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.300
I'M SORRY,
IS THAT OFFENSIVE TO SAY?

10:05.343 --> 10:07.781
JUST GET ME
THE PHILLIPS HEAD.
UM...

10:07.824 --> 10:09.696
THE CRISSCROSSY ONE.

10:09.739 --> 10:14.701
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

10:14.744 --> 10:19.096
DR. CASTELLANO IS OUT
OF THE OFFICE. COME ON.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.102
[gasps]

10:25.146 --> 10:26.974
JACKPOT.
HOW IRONIC.

10:27.017 --> 10:29.846
THE GUY WHO HATES PEOPLE
READS PEOPLE.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.935
IT'S LIKE IF I READ A MAGAZINE
CALLED MUSTARD ON HOT DOGS.

10:31.979 --> 10:35.243
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
IN THE DRAWER.

10:35.286 --> 10:36.374
IT'S ADDRESSED
TO "CHRISTINA."

10:36.418 --> 10:37.680
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S HIS EX-WIFE.

10:37.724 --> 10:38.681
LET'S READ IT.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.597
EH...

10:41.641 --> 10:43.860
[Danny]
DEAR CHRISTINA, WHEN I LEFT
FOR THE AIRPORT TODAY,

10:43.904 --> 10:46.167
I COULD ONLY PICTURE
TWO THINGS:

10:46.210 --> 10:47.995
YOUR GORGEOUS,
NAKED BODY, AND--

10:48.038 --> 10:49.518
[both]
[gasp]

10:49.561 --> 10:52.260
SHOULD WE KEEP READING?
YES.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.699
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS,
IF I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

10:56.743 --> 10:59.267
THIS THING
WOULD BRING ME A LOT OF JOY.

10:59.310 --> 11:02.139
YEAH, MAN. THIS BUNK BED,
IT IS BANGIN'.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.445
SO YOU GOT ANY FOOD
IN THERE?

11:03.488 --> 11:05.665
CAN YOU MAKE ME
A SANDWICH OR SOMETHING?

11:05.708 --> 11:09.494
OKAY, I DO NOT THINK THAT
I HAVE THE COMPONENTS FOR THAT.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.540
OKAY.
BUT I DO HAVE
SOME TEQUILA.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.802
AND GET THIS:

15:10.997 --> 15:15.610
CAN I JUST SKIP

15:15.653 --> 15:17.133
UNBELIEVABLE.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.613
EXCUSE ME?

15:18.656 --> 15:19.962
WELL, FIRST,
YOU CUT EVERYBODY,

15:20.006 --> 15:21.833

YOU'RE USING A CELL PHONE.

15:21.877 --> 15:22.922
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NEXT--

15:22.965 --> 15:24.836
PUSH WHEELCHAIR GUY
DOWN THE STAIRS?

15:24.880 --> 15:26.621
I'M A DOCTOR,
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:26.664 --> 15:27.839
REALLY?

15:27.883 --> 15:29.841
WELL, THEN YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW THAT

15:29.885 --> 15:31.843
THOSE CELL PHONES CAN MAKE ALL
THE MACHINES IN HERE EXPLODE.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.367
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

15:33.410 --> 15:35.717

15:43.377 --> 15:45.945
[Mindy]
HEY, RILEY,

15:45.988 --> 15:46.902
DO YOU STILL WANT
TO HEAR A STORY?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.164
OKAY.

15:48.208 --> 15:51.907
IT IS ABOUT THE FIRST TIME
I MET YOUR MOM.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.563
WE ACTUALLY LIKED THE SAME GUY
ON OUR FLOOR FRESHMAN YEAR.

15:55.606 --> 15:57.869
THIS, UM, WHITE GUY WITH
DREADLOCKS FROM LONG ISLAND.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.132
HE WAS SUPER,
SUPER HOT.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.437
VERY HARD LOOK
TO PULL OFF.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.048
BUT THE POINT IS

16:02.091 --> 16:03.701
THAT YOUR MOM AND I
ACTUALLY

16:03.745 --> 16:05.486
WEREN'T VERY GOOD FRIENDS
WHEN WE FIRST MET EITHER.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.141
BUT IT ALL WORKED OUT,
BECAUSE OVER WINTER BREAK,

16:08.184 --> 16:10.143
HE BROKE HIS LEG
IN A SKIING ACCIDENT.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.145
YOUR MOM AND I HAD SOME TIME
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

16:12.188 --> 16:15.061
AND WE HAVE BEEN
BEST FRIENDS EVER SINCE.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.498
AND I'M NOT
PROMISING ANYTHING,

16:17.541 --> 16:18.890
BUT I HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD FEELING

16:18.934 --> 16:21.458
THAT, UH, YOU AND I COULD BE
PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS TOO.

16:21.502 --> 16:22.459
REALLY?

16:22.503 --> 16:23.852
YEAH.
OH, HELL, YEAH.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.028
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S ACTUALLY EVEN EASIER

16:26.072 --> 16:27.377
BECAUSE YOU AND I
ARE NOT EVEN

16:27.421 --> 16:28.509
GONNA BE COMPETING
FOR THE SAME GUYS.

16:28.552 --> 16:31.381
FOR, LIKE,
AT LEAST TEN YEARS.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.646
[Danny]
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

16:35.690 --> 16:37.561
I WAS JOGGING

16:37.605 --> 16:39.737
AND A PIGEON FLEW
INTO MY EYE.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.957
I LIKE PIGEONS.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.524
THEY'RE FREE TO LEAVE,

16:43.567 --> 16:46.309
BUT THEY CHOOSE TO STAY HERE
IN NEW YORK ALL WINTER LONG.

16:46.353 --> 16:47.832
UNLIKE
THOSE OTHER COWARD BIRDS.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.747
I DON'T LIKE THE ONE
THAT DID THIS TO MY EYE.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.532

SOUNDS LIKE A BAD ONE.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.666
THEY'RE BUGGING ME

17:38.709 --> 17:40.755
BECAUSE I BANNED

17:40.798 --> 17:41.886
I JUST HATE THAT SITE.
