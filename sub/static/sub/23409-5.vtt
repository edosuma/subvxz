00:01.990 --> 00:03.058
<i>Previously... On "Burden of Truth"</i>

00:03.059 --> 00:03.820
<i>- We're sick.
- Yeah, thanks to your Dad.</i>

00:03.890 --> 00:06.520
This has nothing
to do with the mill!

00:06.590 --> 00:08.820
<i>Soil samples taken from the
field show traces</i>

00:08.830 --> 00:11.090
<i>of contaminants including
benzene and methyl mercury.</i>

00:11.090 --> 00:13.630
- Does this mean I'm hired?
- Yeah. Meet us at Billy's

00:13.700 --> 00:15.530
office, 9AM sharp tomorrow.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.500
<i>That kid
you were driving around?</i>

00:17.570 --> 00:19.530
- She's your sister.
- Tell me it isn't true.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.670
- Tell you what's not true?
- Gerrilyn Spence.

00:21.740 --> 00:23.500
<i>Gerrilyn Spence is a liar!
She's crazy.</i>

00:23.570 --> 00:26.140
Crazy like Mom was crazy?

00:28.580 --> 00:32.009
- Prom is lame.
- Hey...

00:32.080 --> 00:34.020
- You're lame.
- What?! Everyone acts

00:34.020 --> 00:35.980
like it's such a big deal.

00:36.050 --> 00:37.950
Everyone's stinky and sweaty.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.420
- I mean, it's in a gym!
- Well, I can't wait for prom.

00:40.490 --> 00:43.160
I just got a new dress, and I'm

00:43.230 --> 00:45.190
- gonna be smokin' hot!
- Oh...

00:45.200 --> 00:47.330
Yeah, well, it can't be
too hot. School dress code

00:47.400 --> 00:49.830
- applies for prom too.
- Principal Weller's gonna

00:49.830 --> 00:52.300
- be there measuring our dresses?
- Oh, God, man.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.300
- What a perv.
- Ladies, your cleavage

00:54.370 --> 00:56.470
is very distracting
around the boys.

00:56.470 --> 00:59.210
But now do behave yourselves
tonight, you animals!

00:59.280 --> 01:01.580
No, I'm gonna go naked.

01:01.580 --> 01:04.050
Just completely wearing nothing.

01:04.050 --> 01:06.150
- Dude!
- I would kill to see the look

01:06.220 --> 01:08.150
- on Weller's face.
- Oh, hey.

01:08.220 --> 01:10.380
- Hey.
- I swiped this

01:10.450 --> 01:12.520
- from my dad's liquor cabinet.
- It's probably full of benzene.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.160
- Molly, Molly.
- I'm kidding.

01:15.220 --> 01:17.930
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come sit.
That was terrible.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.600
So you guys gonna
go to prom together?

01:20.660 --> 01:22.430
- Yes.
- No.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.130
Who else are we gonna go with?

01:26.200 --> 01:29.770
My mom's head would explode.
I'm pretty sure that she thinks

01:29.840 --> 01:31.740
- that you can catch gay, so...
- Oh, you can.

01:31.810 --> 01:34.010
I caught it from the water
fountain by the science lab.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.240
- Oh, yeah?
- Just steer clear of that area.

01:36.310 --> 01:38.250
- That's it.
- Noted.

01:38.310 --> 01:40.220
Oh, Molly. Molly, Molly.

01:40.280 --> 01:43.020
It's OK. It's fine.

01:43.090 --> 01:45.020
I'm so sick of this!

01:45.090 --> 01:47.460
- I'm so sick of this.
- I know. I know, baby.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.460
All right.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.960
Everybody stand up.

01:54.970 --> 01:57.100
- What?
- Yeah, I've got an idea.

01:57.170 --> 01:59.300
Come on. Everybody stand up.
Come on!

01:59.300 --> 02:01.940
- Why?
- Circle the fire.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.640
- Amanda, why?
- God, just trust me!

02:04.640 --> 02:07.210
Hold hands. Join hands!

02:07.280 --> 02:09.710
- Hold hands.
- OK, holding. It's so cute.

02:09.780 --> 02:12.580
- So romantic.
- Now close your eyes.

02:12.650 --> 02:15.180
- And walk into the fire?
- Can you stop?

02:15.250 --> 02:18.050
I just... I wanna try something.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.460
I, um... I found
this healing ritual.

02:21.460 --> 02:24.130
- "Healing ritual"?
- Yes.

02:24.130 --> 02:25.660
OK. I mean, it's worth...
it's worth a shot.

02:25.660 --> 02:27.830
Ahem. Ahem.

02:27.900 --> 02:31.500
May the shining light
within my soul...

02:33.540 --> 02:35.770
- Hey.
- I'm sorry. OK. Yes.

02:35.840 --> 02:37.610
- Ready?
- Yes.

02:37.670 --> 02:39.540
I'm s...
I'm sorry. OK. OK.

02:39.610 --> 02:41.880
...heal me now
and make me whole.

02:41.950 --> 02:45.150
May the shining light

02:45.220 --> 02:47.450
...heal me now
and make me whole.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.180
May the shining light
within my soul

02:50.250 --> 02:53.350
heal me now and make me whole.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.620
May the shining light
within my soul

02:56.630 --> 02:59.490
heal me now and make me whole!

03:50.750 --> 03:53.750
Good morning.

03:55.620 --> 03:57.590
Have a nice day.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.330
Good morning.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.930
You know it's
the weekend, right?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.540
Yeah. You're here too.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.839
You've been here all night?

04:17.910 --> 04:20.680
I couldn't sleep.

04:20.740 --> 04:22.580
It is never too early

04:22.650 --> 04:24.450
for trial strategy,

04:24.510 --> 04:27.250
so we find holes in our case
and... there are a few.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.850
You need to take
better care of yourself.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.790
Warriors never
slept before battle.

04:32.790 --> 04:35.190
That's 'cause they didn't have
alarm clocks. Sleep is good.

04:35.190 --> 04:38.590
You need to take time now,
before the trial,

04:38.660 --> 04:40.660
or you're not gonna make it.

04:42.870 --> 04:45.970
I almost got trampled
by a couple of Matheson's guys.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.740
We filed suit, Billy.
We've declared war.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.600
I knew people would be upset
about us going after their

04:50.670 --> 04:52.940
- biggest employer, but...
- They don't want it to be

04:53.010 --> 04:55.410
the mill, and they are
not going to be rational.

04:55.410 --> 04:58.650
This is only the beginning
of the blowback.

04:58.710 --> 05:01.350
I guess I'm just not used to it.

05:01.420 --> 05:03.420
Being the bad guy?

05:14.900 --> 05:16.830
Did you talk to your dad
about Luna?

05:16.830 --> 05:19.500
He said it isn't true.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.970
Do you believe him?

05:22.040 --> 05:23.800
I... I really, um...

05:23.870 --> 05:25.640
I don't know,

05:25.710 --> 05:30.010
but as of right now,
it is just an allegation.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.780
I made a preliminary
list of names of people

05:32.780 --> 05:34.720
we have to depose
when we get to discovery.

05:34.780 --> 05:37.450
Obviously, Ben Matheson's name
is at the top of the list,

05:37.520 --> 05:40.120
but if we wanna
nail the parent company,

05:40.190 --> 05:42.790
that means officers, directors.

05:42.790 --> 05:45.160
It'll be good to finally
get at the truth.

05:52.740 --> 05:56.140
- Good morning, Mom.
- Hey.

05:56.210 --> 05:58.270
- I'm making eggs.
- I've gotta get to work,

05:58.340 --> 06:00.310
- but thanks.
- Well, I can make them to go.

06:00.310 --> 06:03.940
Uh... this water bill's
due today. Can you pay this?

06:03.950 --> 06:08.420
Yeah. I can pay the water bill.

06:08.480 --> 06:11.020
How's the, uh... job going?

06:11.090 --> 06:13.420
It's good. I'm learning lots.

06:13.490 --> 06:15.360
It'll look great on my resume.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.160
Hey, Mom...

06:18.230 --> 06:21.560
do you remember when you were
talking about taking your GED?

06:21.630 --> 06:23.660
I'm not some dumb dropout.

06:23.730 --> 06:25.500
- I was on the honour roll.
- Yeah, I know.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.370
And I would've been
the first in our family

06:27.370 --> 06:29.170
- to go to college.
- And then I happened.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.410
Things happen.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.910
Jeez. Don't go
making it all about you.

06:42.390 --> 06:44.390
Well...

06:44.450 --> 06:47.460
this was just lying
around the office.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.420
It's old, but it works.
No one's using it.

06:50.490 --> 06:53.660
Now you can do your GED

06:53.730 --> 06:56.230
and we can
go to college together.

07:03.810 --> 07:05.810
Yeah.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.840
Don't forget
about the water bill.

07:10.810 --> 07:12.780
See you.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.030
Good morning.

07:31.030 --> 07:34.240
Oatmeal's hot, sweetheart.

07:34.300 --> 07:37.640
Thank you.

07:37.710 --> 07:40.310
Where were you last night?

07:44.480 --> 07:46.910
- I was just...
- Careful.

07:46.980 --> 07:49.180
We don't tell lies
in this house.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.450
I was just out
with some friends.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.120
It's no big deal.

07:54.190 --> 07:56.290
It is a big deal if we
can't trust your word.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.970
Look... I know
that you've been hurting.

08:05.030 --> 08:08.140
Losing Steve was hard
on all of us, especially you,

08:08.200 --> 08:10.400
but you can't let that ruin
the rest of your life.

08:10.470 --> 08:12.440
We worry about some
of your friends, sweetheart.

08:12.510 --> 08:15.510
They're a bad influence on you.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.450
What, are you serious?

08:21.520 --> 08:25.890
God instructs parents
to teach their children purity.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.360
Now if those girls
had been taught correctly,

08:29.430 --> 08:32.159
they wouldn't be
where they are now.

08:32.159 --> 08:35.429
They're not twitching
because they're... impure.

08:38.870 --> 08:41.570
Why don't you invite Molly
to service this morning?

08:41.640 --> 08:45.610
Now, your oatmeal's
getting cold.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.360
Oh, no...

09:01.420 --> 09:03.960
Mommy... there's something...
there's something wrong.

09:05.860 --> 09:07.760
The mill's parent company
showed worldwide revenues

09:07.830 --> 09:11.230
last year of over
a billion dollars.

09:11.230 --> 09:13.800
- If you were Luna, wouldn't you...
- The girls won't see a cent

09:13.870 --> 09:17.200
of this unless we can prove that
they knew about the barrels.

09:17.210 --> 09:20.170
She deserves to know.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.010
Not until I
have evidence, Billy.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.310
I'm not gonna...

09:24.380 --> 09:26.480
blow up her life
unless I know for sure.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.480
Hey, guys.

09:29.490 --> 09:31.350
Luna, good morning.

09:31.420 --> 09:34.020
Good morning. Any word
from the mill?

09:34.020 --> 09:36.020
No, they have 20 days
to respond and they'll

09:36.090 --> 09:38.030
- probably take all of them.
- "20 days"?!

09:38.090 --> 09:40.560
What's this?

09:40.630 --> 09:42.730
Those are financial statements
from PNL Steel.

09:42.730 --> 09:46.270
- That's Matheson Steel's...
- Parent company. Yeah, I know.

09:46.340 --> 09:48.140
We want a big settlement,
we need to make a case

09:48.200 --> 09:50.500
- against the parent company.
- Luna, it's Sunday.

09:50.570 --> 09:52.710
Why don't you
just take the day off?

09:52.710 --> 09:55.680
I'd rather stay and work,
if that's all right with you.

09:55.740 --> 09:58.410
So... how do we make a case

09:58.480 --> 10:00.910
- against the parent company?
- Parents aren't responsible

10:00.920 --> 10:03.720
for the transgressions
of their subsidiaries

10:03.720 --> 10:05.850
unless we can
prove that they knew.

10:05.920 --> 10:08.460
- What is it?
- It's the church.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.730
- Did you get a text from God?
- We have to get over there right now.

10:13.730 --> 10:16.600
<i>Now in this day
and age, we must be vigilant.</i>

10:16.600 --> 10:18.600
<i>Our youth...</i>

10:18.670 --> 10:21.570
are being bombarded
by hedonistic influences.

10:21.640 --> 10:24.340
And we must prepare them
for battle.

10:24.410 --> 10:27.040
Never has a generation had
such a mighty enemy to overcome

10:27.110 --> 10:29.010
in its path to purity,

10:29.080 --> 10:32.810
and I stand here today
to challenge you.

10:32.820 --> 10:34.720
Our community leaders,

10:34.780 --> 10:36.580
our schools, our parents,

10:36.650 --> 10:39.420
I challenge you to help

10:39.490 --> 10:42.290
these sick girls
who have been led astray.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.090
Now, we were told

10:45.160 --> 10:47.900
that it was poison
that made our girls sick.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.730
And I do believe
that they were poisoned,

10:49.800 --> 10:52.370
but not by Matheson Steel,

10:52.440 --> 10:56.100
but by the toxicity
of this modern world.

10:56.170 --> 10:59.170
Now, I want you all
to think long and hard

10:59.180 --> 11:01.610
about this lawsuit,
and then focus more

11:01.680 --> 11:06.250
on our own decisions,
things that are in our control.

11:06.320 --> 11:10.080
For some problems cannot
be solved in a courtroom.

11:10.150 --> 11:12.290
Beware of silver tongues

11:12.350 --> 11:14.590
and those who would
willingly lead us astray.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.290
And remember...

11:17.360 --> 11:20.700
that the devil
comes in many forms.

11:30.210 --> 11:32.340
He actually
called you the devil?

11:32.410 --> 11:34.340
Yeah. It was a little bit
on the nose.

11:34.410 --> 11:38.050
Well, Millwood isn't
really a hotbed of creativity.

11:38.110 --> 11:40.080
You OK?

11:40.150 --> 11:42.080
Yeah. Not the first
time I've been

11:42.150 --> 11:44.050
compared to Satan,
won't be the last.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.420
I expected the town to be pissed

11:46.420 --> 11:48.260
but this is pretty extreme.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.190
Yeah. Everyone's getting
out their pitchforks.

11:50.260 --> 11:52.960
There's an expression
in Guyana my mom used to say.

11:53.030 --> 11:55.800
"Every bush a man nighttime."

11:55.860 --> 11:58.970
When you're afraid,
things always seem scarier

11:58.970 --> 12:00.430
than they actually are.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.640
True enough.

12:02.710 --> 12:04.910
Is everything all right?

12:04.970 --> 12:07.610
Is that a trick question?

12:09.510 --> 12:11.510
This is me.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.650
Good luck at work today.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.850
- Try not to get yourself killed.
- Yeah, you too.

12:34.540 --> 12:37.040
Uh... hey. Can I borrow a pen?

12:37.110 --> 12:39.840
I promise I'll
give it back this time.

12:44.610 --> 12:47.010
What the hell's going on here?

12:47.020 --> 12:49.180
Sherry said her mom wouldn't
let her come to school.

12:49.250 --> 12:52.090
- Said she's gonna catch it.
- Are you kidding?

12:52.090 --> 12:53.990
The whole world wants us gone.

12:53.990 --> 12:56.160
Bet you never thought we'd be
the zombies in the apocalypse.

12:56.230 --> 12:59.790
Miss Ross? A word.

13:11.870 --> 13:14.480
Look... there's
no easy way to say this.

13:16.650 --> 13:19.750
- Your outfit.
- What about it?

13:19.820 --> 13:23.220
You're violating the dress
code in several different ways.

13:25.290 --> 13:27.490
- Is he serious?
- I am. Slightly exposed

13:27.560 --> 13:30.390
midriff, skirt that doesn't
extend past your fingertips.

13:30.390 --> 13:33.090
- This is ridiculous.
- Miss Evans, there are rules.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.060
You should be enforcing them.

13:35.130 --> 13:37.130
It's like 100 degrees outside.
I just wanted to be comfortable.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.270
I'm not enforcing a dress code.

13:39.270 --> 13:41.046
The rules are very clear.

13:41.047 --> 13:42.900
The rules teach girls their
bodies are dangerous.

13:42.970 --> 13:45.070
Hey, I've worn this exact
outfit like, 100 times.

13:45.140 --> 13:47.140
And I am just
enforcing the rules.

13:47.210 --> 13:49.140
Unless you have a change
of clothes in your locker,

13:49.210 --> 13:51.610
you'll have to go home.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.250
- I can't believe this.
- Neither can I.

13:54.320 --> 13:58.520
Miss Evans, call her mother and
see that she makes her way home safely.

14:04.190 --> 14:06.390
I wasn't trying
to cause trouble. I know you

14:06.460 --> 14:08.700
- hate what I wear too.
- I'm your mom. Hating what you

14:08.760 --> 14:11.770
wear is my God-given right.
Weller's off his rocker.

14:15.470 --> 14:17.370
OK. You gotta
take me home to change.

14:17.370 --> 14:19.440
No. Screw that.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.310
Screw Weller.

14:21.310 --> 14:23.180
I'm busting you out
of this gulag.

14:23.250 --> 14:26.750
We're going shopping.

14:28.180 --> 14:30.220
<i>I mean, it's like, who do they
even think they are?!</i>

14:30.290 --> 14:32.220
Like they never
sinned or anything.

14:32.290 --> 14:34.660
- And what does that even mean?!
- They're panicking.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.160
Millwood's been known
to do some unreasonable things,

14:37.230 --> 14:39.260
even at the best of times.

14:39.330 --> 14:41.760
Yeah. Like I need
this right now.

14:41.830 --> 14:43.700
It feels like everywhere I go,

14:43.770 --> 14:45.830
things are just falling apart.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.370
Seriously, what's wrong
with you today?

14:51.440 --> 14:54.840
Forget it. Ahem.

14:57.280 --> 15:00.880
OK. Feels like I'm just making
everybody mad these days.

15:00.950 --> 15:02.880
I think it's my special talent.

15:02.950 --> 15:05.820
You want me to file those?

15:05.890 --> 15:07.850
Yeah, that'd be great.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.190
You know, my mom's
pretty much always mad at me

15:10.260 --> 15:12.630
for being born. I get it.

15:12.630 --> 15:15.030
She had to drop out of high
school when she got preggers.

15:15.100 --> 15:18.500
Maybe that's why she's happy
I'm not into boys. - Ahem.

15:20.570 --> 15:22.670
OK. I can be quiet.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.240
Here are the up-to-date
medical records.

15:39.960 --> 15:43.190
GET OUT OF TOWN, TRAITOR!

15:51.300 --> 15:54.540
You OK?

15:54.600 --> 15:56.570
<i>I didn't even need a new dress.</i>

15:56.640 --> 15:59.570
I was just gonna wear that green
thing I wore to this funeral.

15:59.640 --> 16:03.040
You need a new dress. It's prom.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.910
We can't even afford this.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.880
Don't worry about it.
I spread it out.

16:08.950 --> 16:11.450
- A few bucks on each card.
- I don't even wanna go.

16:13.820 --> 16:15.820
- Everyone wants to go to prom.
- Maybe when you were

16:15.830 --> 16:17.820
in high school,
but things are different now.

16:17.890 --> 16:20.630
No. No. Fashions might change,

16:20.700 --> 16:22.560
but kids stay
pretty much the same.

16:22.570 --> 16:24.500
I know you wanna

16:24.570 --> 16:26.430
go to your prom.
You just wanna go as...

16:26.500 --> 16:28.270
Molly Ross,

16:28.340 --> 16:30.140
star athlete,
team captain, not...

16:30.210 --> 16:32.640
Molly the twitcher?

16:35.180 --> 16:37.280
Whatever makes you happy,

16:37.350 --> 16:39.980
that's what matters.

16:39.980 --> 16:42.580
You and Luna...

16:42.590 --> 16:45.590
don't worry what people think.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.660
I don't worry
about what people think.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.100
Well, then why didn't you
just tell me about you two?

17:00.370 --> 17:02.100
Do we have to do this right now?

17:02.170 --> 17:04.140
This was actually
going really well.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.940
OK, I...

17:09.010 --> 17:11.380
I know the things
they say at your church.

17:11.450 --> 17:14.510
I guess I was just waiting

17:14.579 --> 17:17.220
for a sign that you disagreed.

17:30.630 --> 17:33.430
After Molly got sent home,
all hell broke loose.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.570
Apparently a parent
found a video.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.070
<i>...heal me now
and make me whole.</i>

17:40.140 --> 17:42.840
<i>May the shining light
within my soul</i>

17:42.910 --> 17:44.980
<i>heal me now</i>

17:45.050 --> 17:47.710
<i>and make me whole!</i>

17:47.780 --> 17:49.620
I'm sorry, I can't
watch any more.

17:49.680 --> 17:52.050
This is just
grossly inappropriate.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.190
I demand that the school

17:54.260 --> 17:56.190
take immediate action.

17:56.190 --> 17:58.190
For what?

17:58.260 --> 18:00.360
- Mr. Crawford.
- They're teenagers.

18:00.430 --> 18:02.500
- It's witchcraft.
- And they're scared.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.900
I think we're done listening
to you. We raised Georgia right

18:04.970 --> 18:06.730
and then we find
this on her phone!

18:06.800 --> 18:08.700
- Everyone needs to calm down.
- You keep

18:08.770 --> 18:11.000
- saying it's the field.
- You know, we don't let Amanda

18:11.070 --> 18:14.070
play sports. Tell me
how she got sick.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.910
Well, I'm sure there's
an explanation that doesn't

18:15.980 --> 18:18.750
- include sorcery.
- I have thought about this,

18:18.810 --> 18:20.880
Mr. Crawford, and I don't
see any alternative.

18:20.950 --> 18:24.280
The girls affected
by this illness

18:24.350 --> 18:27.250
will be suspended
from all school functions

18:27.320 --> 18:29.290
until we get an answer.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.190
- The prom is tomorrow.
- We have an answer.

18:31.260 --> 18:33.160
The field was poisoned
by barrels dumped there

18:33.160 --> 18:35.360
- by Matheson Steel.
- OK. You had me going.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.370
But she's getting sicker,
and now she's defying me,

18:38.430 --> 18:40.430
and she's dancing in the woods,
and she's drinking.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.100
This has nothing to do with a
couple of barrels in the field.

18:43.110 --> 18:45.040
For the safety
of the student body,

18:45.110 --> 18:47.570
any student who disobeys
the suspension

18:47.640 --> 18:49.480
will find themselves expelled.

18:51.810 --> 18:54.280
<i>Don't worry. We'll get this
off their records.</i>

18:54.350 --> 18:56.120
They're gonna
get into university.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.390
They'll get over it.

18:58.450 --> 19:00.220
"They'll get over it"?

19:02.660 --> 19:04.590
Half the girls here
and most of the boys

19:04.590 --> 19:06.590
would choose prom
over university.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.530
That can't be
our concern right now.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.400
I had other things I had to do.

19:16.470 --> 19:19.570
Prom is like closure.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.740
Your whole world is high school
while you're there,

19:22.810 --> 19:25.110
and then your world explodes.

19:29.020 --> 19:31.150
or at least it was for me.

19:31.220 --> 19:32.950
Not that you know that
at the time. At the time,

19:32.960 --> 19:35.760
it's just a party
and making out.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.760
Fine. Give me Bailey.

19:42.830 --> 19:45.630
Hey.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.740
The principal isn't
our problem. It's the town.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.340
They're blaming the girls,
not the barrels. Tell Diane

19:52.410 --> 19:54.370
to work on the parents. We need
to take back the narrative.

19:54.380 --> 19:57.480
- I'll talk to the pastor.
- Tell him the devil sends her regards.

19:57.550 --> 20:00.310
Will do.

20:09.190 --> 20:11.560
It's been a while, Billy.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.660
You don't make it to service
as often as you used to.

20:15.730 --> 20:18.100
Or as often as I'd like, Pastor.

20:18.170 --> 20:21.230
I've been busy.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.840
- Is Amanda around?
- She's out of town.

20:23.910 --> 20:25.770
Visiting family.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.640
- Look, I know why you're here.
- You don't

20:28.710 --> 20:31.080
actually believe that these
girls have the devil in them?

20:31.080 --> 20:32.950
No, I don't.

20:33.010 --> 20:35.320
But the teachings of faith
lie in metaphor. You know that.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.420
Look, I christened Molly.

20:37.490 --> 20:39.490
- Most of them.
- So reach out.

20:39.550 --> 20:41.760
Pastor, people are
taking you very literally.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.160
I don't believe it's the devil,

20:44.230 --> 20:46.490
but I do believe
these girls are out of control,

20:46.560 --> 20:48.500
and their sins
have caught up with them.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.870
- Their sins?
- Well, if it helps,

20:51.930 --> 20:55.340
think that... sin
is a guilty conscience.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.310
We found toxins
in the playing field

20:58.370 --> 21:00.240
that are proven to cause
neurological disorders.

21:00.310 --> 21:02.180
And there are studies
that link guilt

21:02.240 --> 21:04.380
and anxiety
to psychosomatic disorders.

21:04.380 --> 21:07.550
Guilt can manifest itself
in a physical form.

21:07.620 --> 21:10.180
The answer lies in Scripture.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.950
And believe it or not,
I am trying to help.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.690
These girls, they have
nothing to feel guilty about.

21:15.760 --> 21:18.120
The church can teach us
how to live faithfully

21:18.190 --> 21:20.190
- in a very complex world.
- Pastor, what is it

21:20.260 --> 21:22.160
that you're not telling me?

21:22.230 --> 21:24.130
I think you should
come back to us, Billy.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.970
I know you're lost.

21:26.030 --> 21:29.100
Your father's struggles,
your brother. And you're

21:29.170 --> 21:32.410
taking all that anger and you're
directing it towards Millwood.

21:32.410 --> 21:34.370
<i>Amanda, sweetheart,
we need to talk!</i>

21:34.440 --> 21:36.380
<i>Mom!
Stay out of my room!</i>

21:39.950 --> 21:41.950
I think it's time
for you to leave.

21:45.490 --> 21:47.250
All right.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.300
Any luck today, Jack?

22:06.510 --> 22:09.610
The best catfishing
in the world is in this river,

22:09.680 --> 22:12.210
and... I can't
even get a nibble.

22:14.650 --> 22:16.750
Not my year.

22:18.790 --> 22:21.090
You and a lot of people
around here.

22:25.930 --> 22:28.100
My wife and I, we had a deal.

22:30.130 --> 22:33.230
I was gonna work and she
was gonna raise Georgia.

22:33.300 --> 22:36.800
She did a good job.

22:36.870 --> 22:38.840
Head of the Parent Council
how many years?

22:38.910 --> 22:40.810
Too many.

22:40.810 --> 22:44.210
She was always
afraid that, uh...

22:44.210 --> 22:46.880
I was gonna get sick and she'd
have to get a job,

22:46.950 --> 22:48.950
and then, uh...

22:53.620 --> 22:55.520
I'm very sorry.

22:57.590 --> 22:59.630
And then I'm on my own,

22:59.630 --> 23:02.060
and Georgia's all grown, and...

23:02.130 --> 23:04.900
boys are calling.

23:04.970 --> 23:07.700
We eat dinner, and...

23:07.770 --> 23:11.140
she sits and looks at her phone.

23:13.980 --> 23:17.140
Cameras are supposed
to point outwards.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.250
This generation seems
to have forgotten that.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.520
"If the youth are not
initiated, they will burn down

23:26.590 --> 23:28.990
the village to feel
the warmth of the fire."

23:29.060 --> 23:32.060
It's not easy for them, either.

23:32.130 --> 23:35.060
Especially now.

23:35.130 --> 23:36.860
She needs your help.

23:39.230 --> 23:42.170
How am I supposed to do that?

23:42.240 --> 23:44.870
Just start. Just talk.

23:47.410 --> 23:49.610
About what?

23:49.610 --> 23:51.610
About...

23:51.680 --> 23:53.510
anything.

24:16.210 --> 24:18.200
Hey!

24:18.270 --> 24:20.440
Hey.

24:20.440 --> 24:24.080
Uh... look. I know that we
haven't got to know each other

24:24.150 --> 24:26.180
very well, but, um...

24:26.180 --> 24:28.180
I need to ask you for a favour.

24:28.250 --> 24:30.220
Well...

24:30.290 --> 24:32.150
If it's for your case,
you're gonna have to go

24:32.220 --> 24:34.120
through proper channels.
I can't take sides.

24:34.190 --> 24:36.520
No, it's not. It's, um...

24:36.530 --> 24:38.990
It's personal.

24:41.900 --> 24:43.660
Shoot.

24:43.670 --> 24:46.930
How quickly can you
do a DNA test?

24:46.940 --> 24:50.200
Normally, a couple of days,
but I'm owed some favours.

24:50.270 --> 24:53.240
- What do you need?
- Ahem.

24:57.410 --> 24:59.210
I need to know

24:59.280 --> 25:01.580
if the people who chewed the gum
are related.

25:50.670 --> 25:52.500
Amanda!

25:57.210 --> 25:59.210
Hi.

25:59.270 --> 26:00.470
I'm breaking you out of here.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.840
What are you staring at?
Go put your dress on!

26:03.910 --> 26:06.150
What are you talking about?

26:06.210 --> 26:09.350
- Oh, we're, uh, crashing prom.
- OK, and what about the suspension?

26:09.350 --> 26:11.690
- Weller can kiss my...
- She can... Hey!

26:13.590 --> 26:15.990
OK. Suit up, Parson.
We gotta go.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.860
the schoolboard for your removal
for professional misconduct.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.720
And I will sue you

40:11.730 --> 40:14.690
for slander and for violating
their civil rights.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.860
- But in the situation...
- If you can't perform

40:16.860 --> 40:19.060

pressures of this town, then we

40:19.070 --> 40:21.000
will find somebody who can.

40:21.070 --> 40:22.870
Furthermore...

40:22.870 --> 40:24.800
