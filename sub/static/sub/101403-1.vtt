01:28.076 --> 01:30.576
How was the flight?

01:38.453 --> 01:39.852
People change.

01:55.137 --> 01:56.103
Hey!

01:59.141 --> 02:00.574
You look great.

02:02.578 --> 02:03.443
This is.

02:03.445 --> 02:04.544
I'm John.

02:06.081 --> 02:07.881
Nice to meet you.

02:08.917 --> 02:11.050
How was your flight?

02:11.053 --> 02:13.588
It
was okay, it was long.

02:13.590 --> 02:15.823
What did you do?

02:15.825 --> 02:17.291
I read.

02:17.293 --> 02:18.760
What'd you read?

02:18.762 --> 02:19.727
This book.

02:23.099 --> 02:25.500
I'm sorry, I meant to
bring you something,

02:27.203 --> 02:29.604
a gift, a wedding present.

02:29.606 --> 02:31.572
- Oh, that's unnecessary.
- That's fine, yeah, really.

02:31.574 --> 02:33.941
- We eloped anyway.
- Congratulations.

02:33.943 --> 02:34.975
Thank you.

02:34.977 --> 02:36.011
Shall we get going?

02:45.556 --> 02:47.456
John's with the New
York Philharmonic.

02:47.458 --> 02:50.058
He's one of their
youngest soloists.

02:50.060 --> 02:52.326
He's a genius.

02:52.328 --> 02:54.595
- I wouldn't say that.
- What, you are.

03:29.969 --> 03:31.769
I live in the endless day

03:31.771 --> 03:36.106
of the sun, waiting for
the light that never comes.

03:39.679 --> 03:41.812
I'll wait for you there.

03:45.151 --> 03:47.284
And it will begin again,

03:48.222 --> 03:49.821
all over, again,

03:54.595 --> 03:55.894
for both of us.

03:57.631 --> 03:59.297
In this land of dust

04:00.501 --> 04:01.299
and heat,

04:07.140 --> 04:08.139
we wait,

04:13.114 --> 04:14.780
as each hour passes.

05:50.115 --> 05:51.348
We just got married.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.183
- Oh, you did?
- Congratulations.

05:53.185 --> 05:54.467
Thanks, man.

05:54.469 --> 05:55.752
We got married two years ago,

05:55.754 --> 05:57.621
and we took this place
over from my parents.

05:57.623 --> 05:58.755
Oh, it's great.

05:58.757 --> 06:00.223
So
what are your plans?

06:00.225 --> 06:01.691
I mean, while you here?

06:01.693 --> 06:03.159
Well, we're gonna be
here for a couple of days,

06:03.161 --> 06:04.628
and then we're going
out to Emmond's Pass.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.296
That's right.

06:06.298 --> 06:08.965
Okay, so I'm gonna give
you the Buckskin Suite.

06:08.967 --> 06:10.634
That is available.

06:10.636 --> 06:11.635
This is for you.

06:25.251 --> 06:26.951
I told them to fly her here.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.118
I agreed to let her come.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.286
Hey, hey, hey, you
did the right thing.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.855
- Really?
- Okay?

06:31.958 --> 06:33.324
Don't worry about it.

07:53.310 --> 07:55.343
Hey.

07:55.345 --> 07:57.178
I got you a room.

07:57.180 --> 07:58.746
Thanks.

07:58.748 --> 08:00.315
It's right next to ours.

08:10.761 --> 08:12.061
You have pretty eyes.

08:13.297 --> 08:14.396
Mom's eyes.

08:27.545 --> 08:31.046
I left some stuff
for you in your room.

08:33.116 --> 08:35.251
You should come
in, get some sleep.

08:36.789 --> 08:37.587
Hey,

08:39.258 --> 08:40.823
you could've told me you
were getting married.

08:45.297 --> 08:47.197
You were
unreachable, Isabella.

08:48.867 --> 08:50.233
Anyway, we eloped.

08:52.070 --> 08:54.104
You should come in
and get some rest.

10:12.188 --> 10:13.387
What is it?

10:15.691 --> 10:19.226
I just remembered, it's
her birthday tomorrow.

10:34.076 --> 10:37.178
I remember the first
time I saw you.

10:38.448 --> 10:43.118
You were on stage,
playing the violin,

10:43.120 --> 10:45.086
and you were like a painting.

10:47.925 --> 10:49.324
I remember.

10:49.326 --> 10:51.359
And you looked at me,

10:54.064 --> 10:56.998
and I wanted to know
everything about you.

11:34.039 --> 11:35.105
- Hi.
- Hey!

11:36.408 --> 11:37.374
How you doing?

11:37.376 --> 11:38.976
Yeah.

11:38.978 --> 11:40.677
Yeah, I'm good, how are you?

11:40.679 --> 11:42.212
Great.

11:42.214 --> 11:44.213
Thanks for coming.

11:44.215 --> 11:46.215
Of course, thanks
for having me.

11:48.555 --> 11:50.154
You wanna come in?

11:50.156 --> 11:51.756
Sure, yeah, this is nice.

11:57.764 --> 11:59.230
Are all these yours?

11:59.232 --> 12:00.164
Yeah.

12:04.170 --> 12:05.203
Thanks for coming,

12:06.106 --> 12:07.338
sitting for me.

12:10.410 --> 12:11.710
I saw you play the other night,

12:11.712 --> 12:15.347
and I thought it was
really beautiful.

12:16.650 --> 12:18.751
I mean, you must get
that all the time.

12:18.753 --> 12:21.387
No, not particularly.

12:23.691 --> 12:28.794
Do you come to concerts
at Julliard often?

12:32.400 --> 12:34.666
I have a friend
who goes there.

12:34.668 --> 12:35.668
I went with her.

12:37.172 --> 12:40.607
But I love classical music.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.081
That piece you played, the?

12:48.083 --> 12:49.249
Serenade?

12:49.251 --> 12:50.383
By Schubert, right?

12:52.587 --> 12:54.821
I've never heard it
played like that before.

12:57.259 --> 12:58.224
How is that?

13:00.663 --> 13:04.565
Sort of melancholic.

13:08.805 --> 13:11.639
And I'm just starting
to paint faces,

13:11.641 --> 13:15.576
so I thought, hey, he
has a pretty face, so.

13:18.781 --> 13:20.181
You mainly do, uh?

13:20.183 --> 13:21.382
Florals and landscapes.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.585
Right, right, right, right.

13:23.587 --> 13:24.586
This one's cool.

13:27.191 --> 13:28.490
Yeah, it's my sister.

13:29.793 --> 13:31.726
What's she do?

13:31.728 --> 13:33.095
She's an actress.

13:33.897 --> 13:34.896
Oh yeah?

13:40.337 --> 13:41.736
You wanna listen
to some music?

13:41.738 --> 13:43.171
Sure.

14:23.582 --> 14:24.448
Hello.

14:39.199 --> 14:40.465
You can send her up.

15:20.608 --> 15:22.608
How did you know
I was in New York?

15:26.615 --> 15:29.249
I saw a picture of you online.

15:30.552 --> 15:31.985
You were opening a club.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.922
I didn't know you
still did that.

15:41.697 --> 15:43.830
But I knew you always
used to stay here.

15:55.778 --> 15:57.445
Why are you here?

16:05.521 --> 16:08.422
One of your old movies was
on television last night.

16:10.693 --> 16:13.795
You were like 12, I think.

16:17.635 --> 16:18.634
You were so cute.

16:19.803 --> 16:21.503
Yeah.

16:21.505 --> 16:22.504
Yeah.

16:27.945 --> 16:31.613
Hey, I met someone.

16:34.518 --> 16:37.287
And he's really, really special.

16:41.092 --> 16:42.659
- What's his name?
- John.

16:45.597 --> 16:46.829
I want you to meet him.

17:36.583 --> 17:37.716
Hey.

17:38.652 --> 17:39.651
Hey.

17:47.662 --> 17:49.161
What is all this?

17:50.898 --> 17:52.898
Just things that
I've collected

17:55.103 --> 17:57.136
and my students have won.

18:05.580 --> 18:09.014
Parents wanna dump their
kids off here for a week

18:09.016 --> 18:10.816
so they could learn how to ride.

18:14.456 --> 18:15.455
Oh yeah?

18:16.959 --> 18:20.427
Well, looks like
you're good at it.

18:22.564 --> 18:24.865
Well, I've been here
for almost six years now.

18:30.739 --> 18:31.905
It seems lonely.

18:38.014 --> 18:39.013
It is.

19:10.781 --> 19:14.116
There's a reception at the
gallery that I work at tonight.

19:15.152 --> 19:16.652
I'd love for you to come.

19:18.589 --> 19:19.721
You could meet John.

19:22.026 --> 19:24.093
Oh, I'll write down the address.

19:29.601 --> 19:30.900
You're still painting?

19:33.038 --> 19:34.904
Yeah, you'd know
that if you...

19:37.843 --> 19:40.326
I came here tonight

19:40.328 --> 19:42.812
because I wanted to see you.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.616
It's pretty much that simple.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.219
Because I wanted you to know

19:49.221 --> 19:50.521
what's going on in my life,

19:51.858 --> 19:54.859
'cause I haven't seen
you in three years,

19:54.861 --> 19:56.794
three fucking years!

19:58.831 --> 20:00.498
And I said to myself, I said,

20:01.234 --> 20:03.000
let her get on with her life,

20:03.870 --> 20:06.887
let her do her thing,

20:06.889 --> 20:09.907
but, for whatever
reason, I can't.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.678
I can't do that.

20:23.824 --> 20:26.057
I came here today to
show you that I care.

20:29.830 --> 20:31.062
Please, come tonight.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.202
Show me that you do, too.

22:08.265 --> 22:09.365
How was your night?

22:13.939 --> 22:17.340
I could hear you, last night.

22:26.084 --> 22:30.687
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

22:30.689 --> 22:34.691
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

22:34.693 --> 22:37.010
Wait.

22:37.012 --> 22:39.329
♪ Happy birthday, Isabella ♪

22:39.332 --> 22:40.798
No, no, no, no, no.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.466
♪ Happy birthday ♪

22:42.468 --> 22:44.035
Hey, Isabella.

22:45.004 --> 22:47.772
Please come tonight, meet John.

22:49.208 --> 22:50.408
- Hey!
- Stop, stop!

23:15.736 --> 23:16.435
- Louise, stop.
- No!

23:16.437 --> 23:17.952
Stop!

23:17.954 --> 23:19.470
I was just trying to do
something nice for her.

23:20.874 --> 23:22.709
She makes everything as
difficult as possible.

23:22.711 --> 23:23.710
She's sick.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.211
I just feel bad for her.

23:26.213 --> 23:27.145
Why are you defending her?

23:27.148 --> 23:28.071
You just met her!

23:28.073 --> 23:28.996
- You don't even know her!
- I'm not defending,

23:28.998 --> 23:29.921
I'm not defending her!

23:29.923 --> 23:30.847
Okay?

23:33.488 --> 23:35.254
She's completely delusional.

23:40.995 --> 23:42.829
This was supposed
to be our time.

23:46.836 --> 23:48.118
I think it'll be okay.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.403
No, you don't know her, okay?

23:49.405 --> 23:50.404
At all.

23:55.544 --> 23:56.843
European.

23:56.845 --> 23:58.145
Robert's come all
the way from London.

23:58.147 --> 23:59.113
Yeah.

24:00.783 --> 24:05.919
And Louise just graduated
top of her class in painting.

24:07.757 --> 24:10.190
We've got one of her paintings
over there, actually.

24:10.192 --> 24:11.469
That is sweet.

24:11.471 --> 24:12.747
Oh, what are some

24:12.749 --> 24:14.026
of your inspirations,
sweetheart?

24:14.030 --> 24:17.165
I think probably my sister.

24:17.167 --> 24:19.400
So what I think, we should
keep painting here for a week,

24:19.402 --> 24:21.803
see how it goes, and then
we might have to get back.

24:21.805 --> 24:23.772
Excuse me.

24:27.077 --> 24:28.109
- Hi.
- Hey.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.479
This is great.

24:31.481 --> 24:32.947
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:35.119 --> 24:38.387
I don't think
Isabella's gonna come.

25:09.555 --> 25:10.954
Hey.

25:11.857 --> 25:12.856
Hey.

25:17.396 --> 25:18.862
I'm sorry for earlier.

25:18.864 --> 25:19.996
It's okay.

25:31.244 --> 25:33.044
What's that?

25:33.046 --> 25:34.946
Something
I'm working on.

25:37.250 --> 25:38.649
Will you play it for me?

25:41.888 --> 25:43.588
I know how important
it is to you.

25:45.592 --> 25:46.892
Thanks again
for the lesson.

25:46.894 --> 25:48.093
You're very welcome.

25:48.095 --> 25:49.194
You folks enjoy your stay now.

25:49.196 --> 25:50.195
Thank you.

26:26.902 --> 26:28.701
So how you feeling
about marriage?

26:31.206 --> 26:32.272
I don't know yet.

26:36.445 --> 26:39.146
I feel it's such a thing
with our generation, you know?

26:39.949 --> 26:42.116
So many fucking apps.

26:42.118 --> 26:44.834
We didn't meet on an app.

26:44.836 --> 26:47.553
I know, it just not
about connection anymore.

26:47.556 --> 26:49.123
What do you mean?

26:49.125 --> 26:50.391
For us, maybe, but...

26:52.728 --> 26:56.330
We're just two people
in this crazy world.

26:57.333 --> 27:00.001
Everything's just
spinning around us.

27:01.571 --> 27:03.438
You're so philosophical.

27:08.578 --> 27:11.446
Yeah, maybe I'll
play for you tonight.

27:15.652 --> 27:17.185
So what's your name?

27:18.588 --> 27:19.721
Louise.

27:21.358 --> 27:22.625
That's a pretty name.

27:24.228 --> 27:26.028
Well, what's yours?

27:34.105 --> 27:34.886
Andres.

27:34.888 --> 27:35.670
What kind of name is that?

28:00.499 --> 28:03.133
Louise, I just
need you over there.

28:03.135 --> 28:04.034
I've gotta go back.

28:04.036 --> 28:05.168
Run along.

28:36.537 --> 28:39.338
Is this
the Haywood Gallery?

28:42.376 --> 28:43.708
Sure is.

28:43.710 --> 28:45.043
Sorry, sorry to bother you.

28:46.580 --> 28:47.546
It's all right.

28:51.085 --> 28:53.152
Can I have one?

28:53.154 --> 28:54.153
Sure.

29:00.262 --> 29:05.265
I was invited to this thing.

29:07.769 --> 29:08.735
Thanks.

29:10.405 --> 29:11.838
Are you an artist?

29:14.443 --> 29:15.542
I am a musician.

29:16.812 --> 29:18.211
- Violinist.
- Oh.

29:20.382 --> 29:22.148
I should've known.

29:22.150 --> 29:23.217
How's that?

29:25.721 --> 29:28.722
I'm an actor, it's what we do,

29:31.160 --> 29:32.159
read people.

29:34.864 --> 29:36.897
You know, you actually
look kind of familiar.

29:38.634 --> 29:40.134
Yeah.

29:40.136 --> 29:41.168
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:41.771 --> 29:42.770
Sure.

29:52.149 --> 29:54.416
Can I tell you a secret?

30:00.891 --> 30:03.325
I don't really
wanna go in there.

30:12.670 --> 30:13.669
Do you?

30:17.742 --> 30:18.875
I have to.

30:20.578 --> 30:22.912
My girlfriend, she's showing.

30:41.534 --> 30:44.334
You didn't tell her, did you?

30:45.538 --> 30:48.338
About that night at the gallery.

30:59.286 --> 31:00.451
Hey.

31:01.888 --> 31:03.521
Where were you?

31:05.525 --> 31:09.260
I just had to go
outside and get some air.

31:09.262 --> 31:10.361
She didn't come.

31:12.899 --> 31:14.298
I knew this would happen.

31:14.300 --> 31:15.700
I don't know why I
thought she would.

31:19.272 --> 31:20.270
I'm sorry, babe.

31:20.272 --> 31:21.271
Hey, I gotta tell you something.

31:25.980 --> 31:27.846
I'm so proud of you.

31:30.017 --> 31:31.817
I'm sorry she didn't make it.

31:33.321 --> 31:34.320
Hey.

31:43.864 --> 31:46.266
There's something
I wanted to ask you.

31:50.305 --> 31:55.408
What made you wanna
become a violinist?

32:01.250 --> 32:02.249
My mom.

32:07.522 --> 32:09.289
Yeah, I was 10, and she took me

32:09.291 --> 32:14.262
to this town upstate
for the summer.

32:18.034 --> 32:20.801
There was this guy I
would always see around.

32:22.972 --> 32:24.454
He had this crazy hair.

32:24.456 --> 32:25.939
I mean, he was
completely normal,

32:25.942 --> 32:28.542
but I just remember him
having this crazy hair.

32:29.646 --> 32:34.549
Anyway, he was a
violinist in this quartet,

32:35.552 --> 32:36.351
and she took me
to see them play.

32:42.026 --> 32:46.528
They opened with Schubert's
Notturno in E Flat Major.

32:47.665 --> 32:49.331
And, as soon as this
guy started playing,

32:49.333 --> 32:53.302
he just transformed,
came to life.

32:57.808 --> 33:01.477
That's when I knew.

33:01.479 --> 33:04.480
Life, I think, is made up
of these kinds of moments.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.752
Sometimes we don't
understand them.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.389
Sometimes we do.

33:24.036 --> 33:25.002
Isabella.

33:28.808 --> 33:29.807
Happy birthday.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.513
Okay?

34:08.514 --> 34:10.416
I'm sorry, I can't.

34:13.187 --> 34:14.387
Louise?

35:17.153 --> 35:19.020
You need anything?

35:19.789 --> 35:22.340
No.

36:01.166 --> 36:02.932
Thanks so much for today.

36:02.934 --> 36:04.400
Of course, no worries.

36:04.402 --> 36:05.868
Yeah, yeah, well
I'll see you soon.

36:05.870 --> 36:07.336
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:07.338 --> 36:08.804
Yeah, good night.

36:08.806 --> 36:10.274
Bye, Louise.

36:10.276 --> 36:13.043
Louise, please remember
to send the invoices

36:13.045 --> 36:14.545
to Mrs. Shrouder.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.714
- We need that deposit.
- Of course.

36:16.716 --> 36:19.216
Oh, and there was an
interview with your boyfriend

36:19.218 --> 36:20.684
in the Times today.

36:20.686 --> 36:21.886
Did you see it?

36:21.888 --> 36:22.887
Impressive.

36:24.190 --> 36:27.191
Oh, and please stop
showing the clients

36:27.193 --> 36:28.192
your drawings.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.560
They asked.

36:30.562 --> 36:32.062
I mean, we showed one of
them in the show, Louise,

36:32.064 --> 36:34.599
and it didn't sell.

36:34.601 --> 36:36.584
Look, I really want
to believe in you,

36:36.586 --> 36:38.570
but, you know, the market
is really competitive

36:38.572 --> 36:40.321
these days.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.073
It's sad, really, I mean
especially for younger artists.

36:42.075 --> 36:45.210
But, you know, we just need
to focus on the business.

36:45.212 --> 36:47.212
I need your full
attention, okay?

36:51.351 --> 36:53.051
Okay, see you tomorrow.

38:45.370 --> 38:47.804
- Did you see this?
- What's that?

38:49.841 --> 38:51.273
- Oh, God.

It does not say that.

39:04.724 --> 39:05.756
No, it doesn't.

39:06.726 --> 39:07.792
How was rehearsal?

39:08.795 --> 39:09.894
It was fine.

39:10.863 --> 39:12.596
Kind of shit.

39:12.598 --> 39:14.331
We've been working
on this new piece

39:14.333 --> 39:16.067

39:16.069 --> 39:20.938

Right, yeah.

39:23.410 --> 39:24.376
Who wrote it?

39:24.378 --> 39:25.410
Me.

39:35.355 --> 39:37.923
You have got to stop that.

39:40.427 --> 39:42.461
You know what they say?

39:42.463 --> 39:45.297
You can't be a real violinist
til your fingers bleed.

39:47.202 --> 39:49.769
Well you're a real
violinist to me.

39:49.771 --> 39:51.104
Thanks, babe.

40:00.248 --> 40:01.739
Hello.

40:01.741 --> 40:03.232
Louise Jones?

40:03.234 --> 40:04.725
- Yeah, speaking.
- Good.

40:04.727 --> 40:06.219
I'm calling from
Mayhew Recovery Center.

40:06.221 --> 40:07.369
Why?

40:07.371 --> 40:08.520
Your sister.

40:08.523 --> 40:09.989
Is she all right?

40:09.991 --> 40:11.457
I can't
really disclose that...

40:11.460 --> 40:13.560
And she
gave you this number?

40:13.562 --> 40:15.529
Yes,
as her next of kin.

40:16.499 --> 40:18.132
Okay.

40:18.134 --> 40:19.207
Okay, thank you.

40:19.209 --> 40:20.282
Look, we'll contact you

40:20.284 --> 40:21.357
- in six months.
- Bye.

40:21.359 --> 40:22.433
Once
her treatment ends.

40:26.208 --> 40:27.341
Who was it?

40:29.945 --> 40:32.513
It's Isabella.

40:56.139 --> 40:59.308
I don't know why I
tried to find her,

41:01.179 --> 41:02.845
why I tried to see her again.

41:05.283 --> 41:08.517
Anyway, they said they'd
call again in six months.

41:08.519 --> 41:09.485
You okay?

41:11.622 --> 41:12.621
Yeah.

41:16.260 --> 41:18.127
Did you talk to Mom?

41:18.129 --> 41:19.128
Yeah.

41:20.498 --> 41:23.033
Yeah, I was surprised
she picked up, actually.

41:25.404 --> 41:27.337
She asked whether
I wore her dress.

41:28.307 --> 41:29.506
- Did you?
- No.

41:34.346 --> 41:36.446
You haven't seen her
in, like, forever.

41:39.451 --> 41:40.450
I know.

41:45.357 --> 41:47.191
He's not what I
imagined for you.

41:49.896 --> 41:50.895
Violinist.

41:54.901 --> 41:56.167
What did you imagine?

41:58.037 --> 41:59.853
I don't know.

41:59.855 --> 42:01.672
Oh, he's kind, and smart.

42:02.942 --> 42:04.108
A genius, actually.

42:06.613 --> 42:08.579
We've got something
I can't explain.

42:15.256 --> 42:17.222
Why did you tell
them to fly me here?

42:17.224 --> 42:18.590
They called me, you put
my name down on the form.

42:18.592 --> 42:19.658
I didn't put your name down

42:19.660 --> 42:22.060
- on a form.
- Yes, you did.

42:22.062 --> 42:23.428
I don't know why
you keep saying.

42:23.430 --> 42:26.098
I didn't put your name
down, I didn't do that.

42:26.100 --> 42:27.599
There were no forms!

42:27.601 --> 42:29.968
- Stop acting like this.
- Acting like what?

42:29.970 --> 42:31.703
Like you had a choice.

42:31.705 --> 42:33.488
Whether you put my
name down or not,

42:33.490 --> 42:35.275
- you had nowhere to go.
- There were so many places

42:35.277 --> 42:36.567
- I could've gone.
- Where?

42:36.569 --> 42:37.859
Your apartment, your
apartment in New York.

42:37.861 --> 42:39.151
You would've
been alone at my apartment.

42:39.153 --> 42:40.444
- I'm alone here!
- No, you're not!

42:43.451 --> 42:48.588
I'm here.

42:54.362 --> 42:56.211
I'm here.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.377
John!

43:12.548 --> 43:13.547
John!

43:16.986 --> 43:19.320
And there you are.

43:19.322 --> 43:21.255
- Thanks again.
- Thank you for staying

43:21.257 --> 43:22.490
at the Indian Princess Inn.

43:22.492 --> 43:23.908
Take care.

43:23.910 --> 43:25.327
- Have a good honeymoon.
- Thanks.

45:18.412 --> 45:19.411
Hey.

45:22.784 --> 45:24.284
Hey.

48:29.978 --> 48:32.979
We're gonna be
gone for five days.

48:33.850 --> 48:36.517
I think it'll be good for us.

48:38.521 --> 48:39.787
For all of us.

48:56.839 --> 49:00.475
We're in the middle of the
fucking wilderness, Louise.

49:02.846 --> 49:06.081
I mean, I could've
just stayed at the inn.

49:06.083 --> 49:07.449
Yeah, you could've.

49:09.953 --> 49:13.488
But I can't be alone, right?

49:14.425 --> 49:15.991
I'm like a danger to myself.

49:17.728 --> 49:19.461
Isn't that what they tell you?

49:21.866 --> 49:22.932
You know what?

49:24.369 --> 49:25.501
You got in the car.

49:25.503 --> 49:28.504
You got in the car and
you got on the plane

49:28.506 --> 49:30.106
because guess what, Isabella?

49:32.043 --> 49:33.042
You need me.

49:38.383 --> 49:40.049
After all this time,
I'm the only thing

49:40.051 --> 49:41.117
you've got left.

49:48.561 --> 49:49.560
You're scared.

49:51.897 --> 49:53.430
- What?
- Yeah.

49:54.834 --> 49:57.401
You're scared
because you're lost.

51:03.639 --> 51:04.905
It's not that easy
for me, you know,

51:04.907 --> 51:08.175
just to put my
life back together.

51:09.812 --> 51:11.878
I don't need you to
remind me about it.

51:11.880 --> 51:12.879
I know.

51:15.017 --> 51:16.016
I know.

51:18.787 --> 51:19.786
I'm sorry.

51:32.635 --> 51:34.602
Do you love him?

51:34.604 --> 51:37.138
Of course.

51:37.140 --> 51:38.706
Of course I do.

51:42.512 --> 51:43.678
It's just that sometimes I think

51:43.680 --> 51:45.012
he loves it more than me.

51:45.850 --> 51:46.815
What?

51:47.852 --> 51:48.817
The violin.

51:51.655 --> 51:53.555
He's under so much pressure.

51:54.792 --> 51:56.091
I try to understand.

51:58.496 --> 52:00.028
I told him not to bring it

52:00.030 --> 52:01.563
or he's gonna practice
like every day.

52:04.668 --> 52:06.869
I don't think he's had
the chance to here.

52:13.011 --> 52:14.544
I saw him.

52:14.546 --> 52:15.545
What?

52:16.748 --> 52:19.782
I saw him playing.

52:20.552 --> 52:23.052
When?

52:23.054 --> 52:24.888
It was at the inn.

52:24.890 --> 52:26.222
I was walking and...

52:26.224 --> 52:28.858
What are you talking about?

52:56.889 --> 53:01.226
Did you play for her?

53:01.228 --> 53:02.761
Isabella?

53:02.763 --> 53:03.762
When?

53:04.665 --> 53:05.864
At the inn.

53:09.603 --> 53:11.303
She said you played for her.

53:11.305 --> 53:13.605
I didn't play for her.

53:23.618 --> 53:24.617
Maybe she saw me.

53:25.620 --> 53:26.686
The door was open.

53:27.622 --> 53:28.754
I didn't play for her.

53:28.756 --> 53:29.889
I mean, it could've
been anybody.

53:34.262 --> 53:35.761
So it doesn't
matter when I'm there?

53:36.664 --> 53:37.964
Of course it matters.

53:37.966 --> 53:39.966
It's different,
though, you're my wife.

55:01.319 --> 55:03.086
It's not that deep.

55:04.690 --> 55:07.190
I don't
wanna get in the water.

55:07.192 --> 55:09.725
It kinda defeats the purpose

55:09.727 --> 55:12.261
of us walking all this way if
you don't get in the water.

55:12.264 --> 55:14.698
I don't care, I
don't wanna get in.

59:02.604 --> 59:04.103
Where were you?

59:18.687 --> 59:20.186
John, where were you?

59:33.002 --> 59:35.970
Louise,
Louise, sorry, wait, wait!

59:41.410 --> 59:42.409
- Wait, wait!
- No!

59:42.411 --> 59:44.411
Louise, stop, stop!

59:45.515 --> 59:46.481
Louise!

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:10.673
Louise.

01:00:10.675 --> 01:00:11.674
Louise.

01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:13.108
- Do something!
- I don't know what you

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.543
want me to do!

01:00:15.546 --> 01:00:16.612
Okay, okay.

01:00:52.751 --> 01:00:53.717
Hold this.

01:00:56.088 --> 01:00:58.222
- Louise.
- Don't move her.

01:00:59.626 --> 01:01:00.564
Louise, wake up.

01:01:00.566 --> 01:01:01.504
- Can I pick her up?
- Don't touch her,

01:01:01.506 --> 01:01:02.444
don't move her, don't move her.

01:01:02.446 --> 01:01:03.384
Louise, it's me.

01:01:03.386 --> 01:01:04.325
Don't fucking touch her!

01:01:30.124 --> 01:01:31.723
Look, we can't just sit here.

01:01:33.127 --> 01:01:34.126
We can't do this.

01:01:35.563 --> 01:01:36.662
- It's too late.
- It's too late?

01:01:36.664 --> 01:01:38.097
Yeah, it's too fucking late.

01:01:38.099 --> 01:01:39.631
It's too late for what?

01:01:39.633 --> 01:01:42.367
To get help, I mean, we
can't do anything for her.

01:01:42.369 --> 01:01:44.571
- Look at her.
- What are you talking about?

01:01:44.573 --> 01:01:45.755
What do you mean what am I

01:01:45.757 --> 01:01:46.939
- talking about?
- She's getting worse.

01:01:46.941 --> 01:01:48.123
- What are you talking about?
- One of us needs to go

01:01:48.125 --> 01:01:49.308
for help.

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:16.432
Louise, she was the
special kid, you know?

01:03:20.739 --> 01:03:22.639
She always made people smile.

01:03:33.652 --> 01:03:35.285
Mom left when we were young.

01:03:37.623 --> 01:03:39.456
I don't know, I guess two girls

01:03:40.759 --> 01:03:43.894
was to much for our dad.

01:03:43.896 --> 01:03:46.931
He didn't really know
what to do with us.

01:03:52.339 --> 01:03:53.338
And, you know,

01:03:55.842 --> 01:03:59.377
she wanted to swim.

01:04:02.582 --> 01:04:06.818
We had this big pool
in our backyard.

01:04:16.931 --> 01:04:18.664
One day, I wanted to teach her.

01:04:22.303 --> 01:04:24.670
I was old enough to
know what I was doing.

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:37.684
I put her head under water.

01:04:41.523 --> 01:04:43.023
Her lungs filled with water,

01:04:48.363 --> 01:04:50.563
and she couldn't breathe.

01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:55.669
Our dad,

01:04:58.374 --> 01:05:02.743
he got home just in time,

01:05:06.049 --> 01:05:08.416
just in time to save her.

01:05:13.856 --> 01:05:16.590
I don't talk about that a lot.

01:05:19.529 --> 01:05:23.732
I mean, I think about it.

01:05:35.946 --> 01:05:37.846
I hadn't talked
to her in so long.

01:05:42.986 --> 01:05:44.987
She contacted me when she...

01:05:46.691 --> 01:05:47.890
She came to see me.

01:05:54.766 --> 01:05:56.499
It'd been a while.

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:06.709
She told me about you.

01:06:13.919 --> 01:06:15.619
And it made sense,

01:06:21.193 --> 01:06:22.893
why she chose you.

01:06:28.667 --> 01:06:29.900
I understood.

01:08:40.872 --> 01:08:42.238
Wait.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.006
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

01:09:03.261 --> 01:09:04.361
John.

01:09:09.635 --> 01:09:10.133
What is it, what is it,

01:09:10.135 --> 01:09:10.633
- what is it?
- There's somebody.

01:09:10.635 --> 01:09:11.133
What is it, what is it?

01:09:11.135 --> 01:09:11.633
What do you mean,

01:09:11.635 --> 01:09:12.133
- there's a man?
- There's a man.

01:09:12.135 --> 01:09:12.633
Where, where, where?

01:09:12.635 --> 01:09:13.133
- He's over there.
- Why didn't you bring him?

01:09:13.135 --> 01:09:13.633
Why didn't you bring him here?

01:09:13.635 --> 01:09:14.133
Wait!

01:09:14.135 --> 01:09:14.634
We can go.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.488
We can leave.

01:09:16.491 --> 01:09:18.341
The fuck are
you talking about?

01:14:14.377 --> 01:14:19.377
