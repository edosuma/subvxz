00:37.710 --> 00:40.178
So, that ends our lesson on STDs.

00:40.212 --> 00:43.214
Next, I'm gonna show you
how to use a condom.

00:43.248 --> 00:46.884
Uh, who the hell are you?

00:46.885 --> 00:52.390
What the... Where the hell did all these
half-baby, half-cabbages come from?

00:52.424 --> 00:53.791
Oh, damn it, Carl!

00:53.826 --> 00:56.928
That boy Carl jerk off
in the cabbages again?!

00:56.962 --> 00:57.729
He sure did!

00:57.763 --> 00:59.063
You got to fire that boy!

00:59.098 --> 01:00.531
I'm gonna fire him right now.

01:00.566 --> 01:01.733
Carl, you are fired, sir!

01:01.767 --> 01:03.634
Carl, you are fired and disgusting!

01:03.669 --> 01:07.071
I got this, honey. Carl... You can't
jerk off on someone's produce!

01:07.106 --> 01:08.373
I-I told him that, honey.

01:08.407 --> 01:10.208
You're not allowed to be here, Carl!

01:10.242 --> 01:12.076
You're [bleep] with our livelihood!

01:12.111 --> 01:14.679
I tried to help you, son,
because you're homeless and

01:14.713 --> 01:17.715
drug-addled, but you cannot be
masturbating on our produce, son.

01:17.750 --> 01:21.252
Carl, that is not the way you make a
baby, by [bleep] on a cabbage head!

01:21.286 --> 01:22.019
I got it, honey.

01:22.054 --> 01:24.188
We can't sell it if
it's covered in your semen.

01:24.223 --> 01:24.722
He knows.

01:24.757 --> 01:25.590
I've already told him.

01:25.624 --> 01:26.491
Carl, get out of here!

01:26.525 --> 01:27.558
You're [bleep] disgusting!

01:27.593 --> 01:28.993
You are fired, fired, fired, fired!

01:29.027 --> 01:31.162
I do not think we're gonna
be able to recommend you for

01:31.196 --> 01:33.398
another job, unless that job
implies that you are supposed to

01:33.432 --> 01:34.265
have semen on produce!

01:34.299 --> 01:35.433
I'm not gonna recommend you.

01:35.467 --> 01:38.136
If anyone calls me, I'm gonna tell
them you are a chronic masturbator!

01:38.637 --> 01:40.972
There's semen everywhere!

01:41.006 --> 01:43.274
This is your last warning!

01:43.308 --> 01:45.543
Come out or we're coming in!

01:47.946 --> 01:51.516
Okay, move, move, move, move!

01:52.117 --> 01:52.784
There he is!

01:52.818 --> 01:53.851
What, behind the turkey?

01:53.886 --> 01:54.886
Get him!

02:00.592 --> 02:09.032
So, on this day of Thanksgiving, I,
president Obama, hereby pardon this turkey.

02:13.806 --> 02:15.106
Obama... soft on crime.

02:15.140 --> 02:16.808
Vote Sarah Palin 2012.

02:16.909 --> 02:19.977
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

02:20.012 --> 02:21.679
Not gonna happen.

02:22.714 --> 02:24.682
Well, I guess that's it, then.

02:24.716 --> 02:30.288
I made my first pizza as a boy of 13, and
now I'm making my last pizza tonight.

02:30.322 --> 02:32.356
Nobody made them like you, gramps.

02:32.391 --> 02:34.325
Hi.
Got a pizza for Silverstein?

02:34.359 --> 02:35.526
Ha ha ha!

02:35.561 --> 02:37.128
Here you are, son.

02:37.162 --> 02:38.963
You got the last one.

02:38.997 --> 02:40.298
Aw, thanks.

02:40.332 --> 02:41.265
Enjoy.

02:48.307 --> 02:49.140
Aah! Aah!

02:50.375 --> 02:51.742
Aah!

02:51.777 --> 02:53.578
Ow! Son of a bitch!

02:53.612 --> 02:54.946
Ah, screw it.

02:54.980 --> 02:56.848
I'll go to Burger King.

02:56.882 --> 02:58.883
Stupid pizza.

03:00.252 --> 03:01.452
Ah, pizza!

03:02.688 --> 03:03.488
Hey!

03:03.522 --> 03:06.691
I want that pizza!

03:09.228 --> 03:10.995
I'm starving!

03:19.104 --> 03:20.404
Poop on it!

03:27.045 --> 03:30.548
The old man later died.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.694
Tarzan love Jane.

03:43.729 --> 03:49.000
I love you, too, Tar...
But Tarzan not <i>in</i> love with Jane.

03:49.034 --> 03:50.568
Hello, yellow!

03:50.602 --> 03:51.969
Hello!

03:59.144 --> 04:00.211
Do it! Do it!

04:00.245 --> 04:01.045
Just do it!

04:07.286 --> 04:08.019
What's he doing?

04:08.053 --> 04:12.456
Take him down! Take him down!

04:16.028 --> 04:19.630
Oh, he was texting me.

04:19.665 --> 04:22.967
We should, uh, probably
get our stories straight.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.102
Mmm! Mom, this is so good.
What is it?

04:25.137 --> 04:26.504
It's called "cole slaw,"

04:26.538 --> 04:28.806
honey, also known as
"poor-people salad."

04:28.840 --> 04:30.942
Mmm! It's delicious!

04:30.976 --> 04:33.177
How do you make it?

04:33.211 --> 04:34.679
Are you my daddy?

04:34.713 --> 04:35.780
Sure, kid.

04:35.814 --> 04:37.949
Oh. This doesn't seem right.

04:50.329 --> 04:51.395
So, I just moved to L.A.

04:51.430 --> 04:52.930
You want to get some Dunkin' Donuts?

04:52.965 --> 04:58.002
Brah, we don't have
Dunkin' Donuts in L.A.

05:11.550 --> 05:12.717
"Knock, knock."

05:12.751 --> 05:13.684
"Who's there?"

05:13.719 --> 05:14.652
"Steve Jobs."

05:14.686 --> 05:16.988
"Well, you've made
my life awesome."

05:17.022 --> 05:19.256
"Oh?
How gracious of you, America."

05:19.291 --> 05:21.826
Oh, compact disc, so clear, so crisp.

05:21.860 --> 05:24.261
Jobs will pay for making you obsolete.

05:24.296 --> 05:26.330
Have at thee!

05:28.266 --> 05:29.533
You've ruined my plan!

05:29.534 --> 05:30.167
What?

05:30.202 --> 05:33.137
Jobs would be dead right now
if <i>you</i> hadn't shown up.

05:33.171 --> 05:34.105
Who are you?

05:34.139 --> 05:36.173
I'm Zuneman!

05:36.208 --> 05:37.808
Ah, the legends are true.

05:37.843 --> 05:38.876
That's right!

05:38.910 --> 05:41.245
There is a sadder hero than myself.

05:41.279 --> 05:45.683
Hey! At least I'm not an outdated format
that's only used as a coaster now.

05:45.717 --> 05:46.784
Oh, no, no, no, no.

05:46.818 --> 05:47.485
You're worse.

05:47.519 --> 05:50.354
Your state-of-the-art software
and crystal-clear sound quality

05:50.389 --> 05:52.790
are matched only by your
terrible product design and

05:52.824 --> 05:54.191
counterintuitive menu display.

05:54.226 --> 05:55.760
We're working on it!

05:56.628 --> 06:00.297
Well, for someone with 120
gigs, you move pretty slow.

06:01.633 --> 06:02.500
Ruh-roh!

06:02.534 --> 06:05.036
Looks like somebody's got a scratch.

06:05.070 --> 06:07.371
Guess I'll have to buy a new one.

06:07.406 --> 06:09.040
They have repair kits!

06:09.741 --> 06:11.175
What are you doing here, CD?

06:11.209 --> 06:12.376
I told you, you're over.

06:13.745 --> 06:14.879
Don't make me kill you.

06:14.913 --> 06:16.781
You already have!

06:16.815 --> 06:20.685
Aaah!

06:20.719 --> 06:21.652
He's dead.

06:21.687 --> 06:22.753
Who are you?

06:22.788 --> 06:23.654
I'm Zune!

06:23.689 --> 06:24.455
Really?

06:24.489 --> 06:25.656
Wow!

06:25.691 --> 06:27.158
What a terrible design.

06:27.192 --> 06:28.359
Make it quick.

06:28.393 --> 06:30.861
Hmm...
I wouldn't waste the bullets.

06:30.896 --> 06:31.629
Please!

06:31.663 --> 06:33.197
Don't leave me like this.

06:33.231 --> 06:33.764
No!

06:33.799 --> 06:35.733
Daddy, what's that?

06:35.767 --> 06:37.401
I think it's a pager.

06:43.408 --> 06:45.009
Hey, what's that?

06:45.010 --> 06:48.412
W-who's there?

06:48.447 --> 06:49.380
Damn it, Alfonse!

06:49.414 --> 06:51.482
That's coming out of
your college fund.

06:57.923 --> 07:00.591
A Teddy Ruxpin?!

07:00.625 --> 07:04.061
He can play any tape, and he moves
his mouth along with the words!

07:04.096 --> 07:05.496
Oh! Thanks, Uncle Gallagher!

07:05.530 --> 07:06.597
Let's try it out!

07:06.631 --> 07:10.534
I've got a copy of my stand-up
special, "Melon Crazy."

07:14.940 --> 07:17.608
Aah!

07:23.348 --> 07:25.316
Aah!

07:28.286 --> 07:30.654
No! He's got a cyanide capsule.

07:30.689 --> 07:33.891
Don't you bite down,
you son of a bitch!

07:33.925 --> 07:35.960
You're gonna play my tape!

07:37.529 --> 07:40.064
He's... he's gone.

07:40.098 --> 07:42.299
Ah. We'll have to listen
to it in the living room.

07:42.968 --> 07:44.935
N-o-o-o-o-o!

07:46.638 --> 07:47.905
Whoo! All right!

07:47.939 --> 07:52.643
I'm Nicky Passion, and I'm here to show
you how to manage your team and...

07:52.677 --> 07:54.378
Achieve your dream!

07:54.412 --> 07:55.346
All right!

07:55.380 --> 07:57.681
Oh, check out the mug on this one.

07:57.716 --> 08:02.319
Hey, mirror, mirror on your face, what
brought you to this helpful place?

08:02.354 --> 08:04.288
Well, I run my own business.

08:04.322 --> 08:05.890
I'm kidding, rearview.

08:05.924 --> 08:07.024
I read your bio.

08:07.058 --> 08:08.225
I know the story.

08:08.260 --> 08:10.628
Let's take a look at your video.

08:10.662 --> 08:13.497
Next time, G.I. Joe!

08:13.532 --> 08:16.066
Next time, G.I. Joe!

08:16.101 --> 08:18.636
Next time, G.I. Joe.

08:18.670 --> 08:21.071
But that next time
never comes, does it?

08:21.106 --> 08:21.605
No.

08:21.640 --> 08:25.709
Maybe it's time you stopped Cobra
Commanding and start Cobra Commending.

08:25.744 --> 08:29.713
You run one of the most successful
terrorist organizations in the world.

08:29.748 --> 08:31.816
Isn't that something to be proud of?

08:31.850 --> 08:32.549
I guess.

08:32.583 --> 08:36.687
Maybe once you step back and look,
you'll realize that you've already...

08:36.721 --> 08:38.722
Achieved your dream!

08:38.756 --> 08:40.924
That's not exactly my dream.

08:40.958 --> 08:43.027
I paid $300 for this?

08:43.061 --> 08:43.994
I'm sorry, sir.

08:44.029 --> 08:45.896
I don't see a name tag for Cy-kill.

08:45.931 --> 08:47.898
But I told Crasher to book my trip.

08:47.933 --> 08:49.133
She must have failed me.

08:49.167 --> 08:51.468
You see, I need this
seminar more than anyone.

08:51.503 --> 08:52.069
Sorry.

08:52.103 --> 08:53.637
There's really nothing I can do.

08:53.672 --> 08:57.308
Well, there's nothing you can do about
me taking all the free cookies.

09:02.814 --> 09:05.516
I am Megatron, leader
of the Decepticons.

09:05.550 --> 09:08.085
Aw, sounds more like
a self-decepticon.

09:08.119 --> 09:09.820
Let's take a look.

09:09.855 --> 09:12.756
This is <i>your</i> fault, Megatron!

09:12.791 --> 09:16.794
You're firing blanks, Megatron!

09:16.828 --> 09:18.462
How do my balls taste, Megatron?

09:18.496 --> 09:20.231
And what's your girl Friday's name?

09:20.265 --> 09:20.931
Starscream.

09:20.966 --> 09:22.533
Listen to me now, tons of fun.

09:22.567 --> 09:25.769
It's not the gun in the fight
but the fight in the gun.

09:25.804 --> 09:29.240
And this guy here is starscreaming
for an ass-whupping!

09:29.274 --> 09:30.341
Listen to me now.

09:30.375 --> 09:34.979
You stand for number one, but
you always sit for number two.

09:35.013 --> 09:36.447
Ah. Thank you.

09:36.481 --> 09:37.648
All right. There you go.

09:37.682 --> 09:39.650
All right.
We got time for one more, folks.

09:39.684 --> 09:41.151
Where is...

09:41.720 --> 09:42.720
Charmin, you all good?

09:42.754 --> 09:43.721
What? Who's there?

09:43.755 --> 09:44.288
Whoops.

09:44.322 --> 09:45.456
I think I woke him, folks.

09:45.490 --> 09:46.223
Who's there?

09:46.258 --> 09:48.959
Anyway, Tommy, do me a favor and
put that shame spotlight on

09:48.994 --> 09:51.495
the gay blade in 13C!

09:51.529 --> 09:52.329
Oh, oh, Nicky!

09:52.364 --> 09:54.331
Bones, what the hell
are you doing here?

09:54.366 --> 09:55.966
I told you, man, I can't help you.

09:56.001 --> 09:59.536
But I've been doing the exercises you
gave me and writing in my dream journal.

09:59.571 --> 10:01.705
Have... have you defeated
He-Man once yet?

10:01.740 --> 10:03.140
Well... just once?

10:03.174 --> 10:04.708
I mean, what does "defeated"

10:04.743 --> 10:06.110
even really mean, you know?

10:06.144 --> 10:09.847
I mean, one man's defeat is just another man's...
Hee hee, I'll just go.

10:09.881 --> 10:11.815
All right, get on out of here.

10:11.850 --> 10:15.719
And remember, folks, you can't be the
top dog if you act like a pussy.

10:15.754 --> 10:17.388
Enjoy your lunch!

10:25.463 --> 10:27.298
I can see your mumm-balls.

10:27.332 --> 10:29.033
Watch out! Evil raisin!

10:29.067 --> 10:32.336
Oh, looks like an old hacky sack.
