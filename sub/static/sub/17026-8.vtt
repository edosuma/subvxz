00:57.199 --> 00:59.399
Previously on ER...

00:59.399 --> 01:00.959
I need
to loosen up a bit.

01:00.959 --> 01:03.319
I have a tendency to micromanage.
Yeah, Cate mentioned that.

01:03.319 --> 01:05.639
I don't want to be here.
I don't like it here.

01:05.639 --> 01:08.959
I know how it is to come back from
a war and feel adrift.

01:08.959 --> 01:11.399
Saying it fancy doesn't make you
seem smarter, Andrew.

01:11.399 --> 01:12.919
It makes you
seem insecure.

01:12.919 --> 01:15.079
Could you get me a
death kit, please?

01:15.079 --> 01:16.639
It's your job to decide

01:16.639 --> 01:19.039
what needs to be considered
and when to speak up.

01:19.039 --> 01:20.639
If you're submissive at all,

01:20.639 --> 01:21.839
you're not ready for this.

01:21.839 --> 01:24.559
I tried to speak up,
and nobody listened!

01:24.559 --> 01:26.399
You can't be
a great doctor

01:26.399 --> 01:27.479
until you've killed
a patient.

01:27.479 --> 01:29.759
So, that
Brenner guy...
Mm-hmm?

01:29.759 --> 01:32.159
Kind of seems
like a dick.

01:37.079 --> 01:39.479
"Because of the ongoing chaos,
there has been

01:39.479 --> 01:42.079
"a depletion of resources,
including water,

01:42.079 --> 01:44.319
"which continues
to divide the area."

01:44.319 --> 01:45.399
What are you doing?

01:45.399 --> 01:47.319
"Water resources are
at such a low,

01:47.319 --> 01:49.319
"scholars are
projecting

01:49.319 --> 01:51.519
"that by 2025, Syria...
(LAUGHING)
OK, put that down.

01:51.519 --> 01:54.879
"Oman, Libya,
and Ethiopia

01:54.879 --> 01:56.999
"will also be struggling
for a larger supply."

01:56.999 --> 01:59.079
That's my thesis.
It's rough.

01:59.079 --> 02:00.999
That is not rough.
That is scholarly.

02:00.999 --> 02:02.799
I haven't even
rewritten that page.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.279
But you...you...

02:05.279 --> 02:07.399
you misspelled,
um, irrigation.

02:07.399 --> 02:08.719
No, I didn't.

02:08.719 --> 02:10.598
Yeah, you did.
It's "I-G," not "A-G."

02:10.598 --> 02:12.039
Look, I can't type.

02:12.039 --> 02:13.999
"One of the most
efficient resources

02:13.999 --> 02:16.479
"is drip irrigation."

02:16.479 --> 02:18.518
You're torturing me.

02:18.518 --> 02:22.278
"But...but...as, er...
as more countries

02:22.278 --> 02:24.678
"gain the use of this...

02:24.678 --> 02:27.758
"this technology,
the...the areas...

02:29.878 --> 02:31.798
"..the areas will become..."

02:42.038 --> 02:43.998
When was Kennedy
assassinated?

02:43.998 --> 02:45.158
John or Robert?

02:45.158 --> 02:46.318
No, I haven't
heard a thing.

02:46.318 --> 02:47.638
I was hoping you had.

02:47.638 --> 02:49.758
Do I look fat?
No, sit down.

02:49.758 --> 02:51.278
Uh, when was Bobby killed?

02:51.278 --> 02:52.478
1978.

02:52.478 --> 02:53.638
'73.

02:53.638 --> 02:55.038
Does your son
have any friends

02:55.038 --> 02:56.278
that may have called?

02:56.278 --> 02:57.478
'65.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.158
'68, Alex!

02:59.158 --> 03:00.518
You got to learn these.

03:00.518 --> 03:01.598
6/6/'68.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.758
I knew that one.

03:02.758 --> 03:03.918
You don't even know

03:03.918 --> 03:05.198
how to choose clothes
that fit you.

03:05.198 --> 03:06.038
I'm changing.

03:06.038 --> 03:08.358
No, you look great.
Sit down.

03:08.358 --> 03:09.878
No, I hear you,
I'll call you

03:09.878 --> 03:11.638
if I know anything,
Mrs Gonzalez. Thank you.

03:11.638 --> 03:14.398
No news?

03:14.398 --> 03:15.718
Maybe this guy wants
to be homeless.

03:15.718 --> 03:18.158
Nobody wants
to be homeless, Sarah.

03:18.158 --> 03:19.678
How do you know?
You know everyone in the world?

03:19.678 --> 03:21.438
No, smart Alex.

03:21.438 --> 03:23.998
Do you know every one
of those flashcards?

03:23.998 --> 03:26.078
Let me see. When was the
war of 1812?

03:26.078 --> 03:28.798
Look, he's thinking of it.

03:28.798 --> 03:31.718
PHONE RINGING
No, no. 1812.

03:31.718 --> 03:34.158
All right, hi.
Yeah, this is him.

03:34.158 --> 03:35.958
Quiet. Shh,
shh, shh.

03:35.958 --> 03:37.998
Shh, it's the
shelter on Third.

03:37.998 --> 03:39.318
Hi, yes.

03:39.318 --> 03:42.478
You haven't heard
from him, OK.

03:42.478 --> 03:44.998
No, thank you.
I appreciate you calling back.

03:44.998 --> 03:46.478
Bye.

03:47.838 --> 03:49.838
I was thinking
of, er, staying put.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.518
I was gonna go back home,

03:51.518 --> 03:54.597
but the airfare
is so bloody expensive.

03:54.597 --> 03:55.717
What about you?

03:55.717 --> 03:56.717
What are your plans?

03:57.797 --> 03:59.357
Oh, that's great, Ray.

03:59.357 --> 04:01.597
Where's she from?

04:01.597 --> 04:04.157
Oh, I've heard, er,
Georgia is beautiful.

04:04.157 --> 04:06.477
Well, that should be fun.

04:06.477 --> 04:09.677
Yeah, well, I guess I'll talk
to you when you get back.

04:09.677 --> 04:11.437
Yeah, you, too.

04:15.117 --> 04:16.677
You don't have to do that.

04:16.677 --> 04:18.677
I don't work on Tuesday.
It's no big deal.

04:18.677 --> 04:19.757
Well, don't worry
about it.

04:19.757 --> 04:21.517
My brother's friends
will help me move.

04:21.517 --> 04:23.357
Uh, Neela, this
is, er, Leanne.

04:23.357 --> 04:24.477
Leanne, Neela.

04:24.477 --> 04:26.277
Moving.
I hate moving.

04:26.277 --> 04:28.397
It's hard to concentrate
on my dissertation

04:28.397 --> 04:29.757
when my roommate's screwing
in the next room.

04:29.757 --> 04:31.637
What's your focus?

04:31.637 --> 04:33.597
Middle Eastern politics.
Speaking of which,

04:33.597 --> 04:35.997
Samir Khalaf's giving a
lecture in an hour. I got to go.

04:35.997 --> 04:38.557
OK...well,
I'll see you tonight.

04:38.557 --> 04:39.797
OK.

04:40.917 --> 04:42.717
She seems impressive.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.157
She's got a full
scholarship

04:44.157 --> 04:45.517
to the University
of Chicago,

04:45.517 --> 04:47.277
and she speaks
five languages.

04:47.277 --> 04:48.717
She twirl around
in phone booths

04:48.717 --> 04:50.477
and fight crime, too?

04:50.477 --> 04:52.157
I'm surprised. She doesn't
seem like your type.

04:52.157 --> 04:53.277
Why is that?

04:53.277 --> 04:54.677
I don't know,
figured you with someone

04:54.677 --> 04:56.437
a little less
intellectually stimulating.

04:56.437 --> 04:57.677
Well, now,
that is rude.

04:57.677 --> 04:58.997
No, you've got
me all wrong.

04:58.997 --> 05:01.437
In fact, it's evolving
into quite a thing.

05:01.437 --> 05:02.637
What about you?

05:02.637 --> 05:03.637
You, er...you

05:03.637 --> 05:04.677
No, riding solo.

05:04.677 --> 05:06.117
Well, I can always
set you up

05:06.117 --> 05:07.357
with one of my
rugby mates.

05:07.357 --> 05:08.677
Yeah, I'd rather
be boiled

05:08.677 --> 05:09.957
and laid in a bed
of cat litter.

05:09.957 --> 05:11.557
Well, I can
arrange that, too.
Bug off.

05:11.557 --> 05:13.117
This is Beth, 46,
fell down

05:13.117 --> 05:14.677
a flight of stairs trying
to escape a house fire.

05:14.677 --> 05:15.557
I'm Dr Brenner.

05:15.557 --> 05:17.517
Do you know where you are?
Hospital.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.237
Shallow resps,
tachy to 125.

05:19.237 --> 05:20.877
Bp's 100/58.

05:20.877 --> 05:23.077
My leg!
It's a closed deformity
on the left.

05:23.077 --> 05:24.437
Looks like a tib-fib.

05:24.437 --> 05:25.797
We'll get you something
for the pain.
How is she?

05:25.797 --> 05:28.276
I told you, you were supposed
to obey the traffic lights.
She's my wife.

05:28.276 --> 05:29.756
Mr Lotery pulled her
from the fire.

05:29.756 --> 05:31.316
I tried to have him looked over,
but he wouldn't listen.

05:31.316 --> 05:32.756
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.

05:32.756 --> 05:33.796
Trauma room.
Let's go.

05:33.796 --> 05:36.116
Bolus 5,000 units heparin,
then 900 an hour.

05:36.116 --> 05:38.356
Hey, do you
have a second?

05:38.356 --> 05:40.436
What's up? I'm late
for a perf diverticulum.

05:40.436 --> 05:42.236
I wanted to talk to you
about the Mendenhall case.

05:42.236 --> 05:44.716
Oh, come on, let's all try
to move on from that, shall we?

05:44.716 --> 05:46.076
If you pull
into the slow lane

05:46.076 --> 05:47.276
every time
there's an accident, Neela,

05:47.276 --> 05:48.516
you're gonna have a problem.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.556
Well, I was thinking
of a way to ensure

05:49.556 --> 05:51.116
that never happens again.
Really?

05:51.116 --> 05:52.676
Well, I hope you plan
to patent that idea,

05:52.676 --> 05:53.916
cos if you have the ability

05:53.916 --> 05:55.036
to control the future,

05:55.036 --> 05:56.556
you might really
be on to something.

05:56.556 --> 05:57.956
Lucien, I'm not joking.

05:57.956 --> 05:59.716
You know what? let's just
use this as an opportunity

05:59.716 --> 06:01.476
to examine and assess
your management style.

06:01.476 --> 06:03.036
My management style
is not the problem.

06:03.036 --> 06:04.356
How am I supposed
to delegate work

06:04.356 --> 06:05.676
to an intern
I can't trust?

06:05.676 --> 06:07.116
Why don't you just make him
into one that you can?

06:07.116 --> 06:08.436
Well, frankly, I wish
I didn't have

06:08.436 --> 06:10.036
to supervise anyone at all.
I'd be better off.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.156
Really? That's really
how you feel?

06:11.156 --> 06:13.436
Yeah, it is.
OK, fine, then.
Permission granted.

06:13.436 --> 06:15.236
You are free of having
to supervise.

06:15.236 --> 06:16.756
No more interns for you.

06:16.756 --> 06:18.996
Well, he's not capable,
he's not competent,

06:18.996 --> 06:20.676
and I can't have him
killing another patient.

06:20.676 --> 06:21.796
I'm moving him.
He's gone.

06:21.796 --> 06:23.276
You made a decision.
Stick by it.

06:24.476 --> 06:27.836
They have me
in the surgical clinic.

06:27.836 --> 06:29.036
You're gonna have to do it
sometime anyway.

06:29.036 --> 06:31.036
Yeah, I was planning
on the end of the year
when I was tired.

06:31.036 --> 06:32.716
You'll be fine.

06:32.716 --> 06:34.596
You know, what if
Dr Rasgotra tries

06:34.596 --> 06:36.276
to cockblock me
in the whole department?

06:36.276 --> 06:37.756
She's not even thinking
about you.

06:37.756 --> 06:39.396
Andrew thinks everyone
is thinking about him.

06:39.396 --> 06:40.876
Do not entertain
his neuroses.

06:40.876 --> 06:42.996
She told Dubenko
she doesn't want me
to work with her.

06:42.996 --> 06:44.876
OK, so give her a few weeks.
She's gonna get over it.

06:44.876 --> 06:46.596
And if she doesn't?

06:46.596 --> 06:48.436
You'll be looking at ass Ditzels
on old women for ever.

06:48.436 --> 06:52.036
Hey, just because
Banfield's on vacation

06:52.036 --> 06:54.516
doesn't mean you guys
can slack off. Tracy,

06:54.516 --> 06:56.756
Grady, Brenner
just got a trauma,

06:56.756 --> 06:57.836
and Daria,

06:57.836 --> 06:59.996
Gates is doing a central line
in Curtains.

06:59.996 --> 07:03.795
And Andrew, you shouldn't
even be down here.

07:03.795 --> 07:05.795
OK, you see, even the nurses
don't want me here.

07:05.795 --> 07:07.595
God, I am gonna
strangle you.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.395
He like this at home?
Uh-huh, all the time.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.195
All right, clearly,
you need some love.

07:11.195 --> 07:12.395
Hands in.

07:12.395 --> 07:13.715
Intern power.

07:13.715 --> 07:15.155
(ALL) Break.

07:15.155 --> 07:16.355
(SIGHS)

07:16.355 --> 07:17.635
Thank God I'm a resident.

07:17.635 --> 07:19.795
Maybe I should call
the VA hospital again

07:19.795 --> 07:21.115
or Voices For Veterans.

07:21.115 --> 07:22.395
You've done enough.

07:22.395 --> 07:24.155
Could also check the alleys
around the hospital.

07:24.155 --> 07:25.435
I haven't done that yet.

07:25.435 --> 07:25.835
Sorry, I got stuck
splinting a three-year-old.

07:25.835 --> 07:26.995
Ten of Lido.

07:26.995 --> 07:28.315
OK.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.715
Now, sir, you're gonna
feel a little stick.

07:29.715 --> 07:31.395
This is the
numbing medicine.

07:31.395 --> 07:32.635
Ceftriaxone's
ready to hang.

07:32.635 --> 07:34.755
What's the name
of that shelter on Michigan

07:34.755 --> 07:37.075
near the El?
Saint Mary's.

07:37.075 --> 07:39.355
My neighbour volunteers there.

07:39.355 --> 07:41.355
All right, angle that up
a little bit.

07:41.355 --> 07:42.555
How many rounds of epi?

07:42.555 --> 07:43.755
< Three, and three
of atropine.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.075
< He was out
20 minutes.

07:45.075 --> 07:45.875
Lily, what's
going on?

07:45.875 --> 07:47.435
Homeless man found down.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.555
All right,
you guys got this, right?

07:50.555 --> 07:53.195
Line is primed.
Only 80 systolic.

07:53.195 --> 07:54.475
OK, wait,
wait, wait.

07:54.475 --> 07:55.915
I can't thread
the guide wire.
Don't pull back.

07:55.915 --> 07:57.835
Try rotating the bevel.
Maybe that's not him.

07:57.835 --> 07:59.235
That's his duffel.

07:59.235 --> 08:00.755
It's not going.

08:00.755 --> 08:02.475
He needs volume
and pressors.

08:02.475 --> 08:04.755
All right, give me gloves.

08:04.755 --> 08:06.635
Open a new tray.

08:06.635 --> 08:08.035
That's it.

09:34.194 --> 09:38.034
Fact: Most ordinary cleaners
make surfaces look clean...

09:40.194 --> 09:42.794
but they can leave bacteria behind.

09:44.274 --> 09:46.634
Dettol All in 1
cuts through tough grease

09:46.754 --> 09:49.754
better than the leading supermarket
own-brand bleach spray.

09:49.874 --> 09:50.874
That's
why it's

09:50.994 --> 09:52.034
the No.1
cleaner.

09:52.114 --> 09:53.674
And unlike ordinary cleaners,

09:53.754 --> 09:56.314
it kills 99.9% of bacteria too,

09:56.394 --> 09:59.074
leaving surfaces clean and safe.

09:59.154 --> 10:00.794
Dettol All in 1.

10:04.514 --> 10:07.034
Clean up this spring
with Dettol All in 1,

10:07.154 --> 10:09.074
just one of a powerful
cleaning range.

10:09.194 --> 10:12.833
Now half price,
only at Tesco.

13:24.351 --> 13:25.511
What labs
do you want?

13:25.511 --> 13:27.751
CBC, trauma panel,
type and cross.

13:27.751 --> 13:29.551
Why won't they leave us alone?

13:29.551 --> 13:30.551
Chest is stable.

13:30.551 --> 13:31.951
It's OK, honey.
We'll move.

13:31.951 --> 13:33.831
Right upper
quadrant's tender.

13:33.831 --> 13:36.911
We're not going anywhere.
This is our home.

13:36.911 --> 13:38.391
We'll talk
about it later.

13:38.391 --> 13:40.191
Let's just get you
well first.
IV's in.

13:40.191 --> 13:42.351
Your interns do know how to
hold a scalpel, right?

13:42.351 --> 13:43.751
Excuse me?

13:43.751 --> 13:44.951
Why was surgery
called down

13:44.951 --> 13:47.271
for a simple buttock abscess?
I was late for a trauma

13:47.271 --> 13:48.191
because I
was tied up doing an I&D

13:48.191 --> 13:49.951
that an ER intern
could have been doing.

13:49.951 --> 13:51.751
Or a surgical intern -
where are your underlings?

13:51.751 --> 13:54.591
That's really not the point.
What have you got?

13:54.591 --> 13:57.871
Beth Lotery, blunt trauma to the
belly and legs, er, minor burns.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.431
How's the ultrasound?

13:59.431 --> 14:00.711
We were just getting
to that.

14:00.711 --> 14:01.951
ALARM BEEPING
Sats 86.

14:01.951 --> 14:02.991
What's happening?

14:02.991 --> 14:04.151
Mrs Lotery, open your eyes.

14:06.911 --> 14:08.431
She's not breathing.

14:08.431 --> 14:09.831
OK, we're intubating.

14:09.831 --> 14:11.151
Tracy, you up for this?
Totally.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.751
Mac two and 70.

14:12.751 --> 14:14.791
Hey, Morris. Can you sew this
and check the chest x-ray?

14:14.791 --> 14:17.151
Let your intern do it.

14:17.151 --> 14:18.711
500cc's in.

14:18.711 --> 14:20.551
He's still
hypotensive.

14:20.551 --> 14:21.911
Two litres,
and start Levophed.

14:21.911 --> 14:22.711
Morris, come on.
He's septic.

14:22.711 --> 14:24.111
Help me get
his pressure up.
What are you doing?

14:24.111 --> 14:26.111
Have to take care
of something.

14:29.711 --> 14:31.271
Hey, Dr Gates.
Hey, Sully,
how are you?

14:31.271 --> 14:32.471
Hey, I need some more of
them coloured condoms.

14:32.471 --> 14:33.951
More? I gave you
a bunch last week.

14:33.951 --> 14:35.911
What are you, jealous?
I'm scared.

14:35.911 --> 14:37.271
I'll hook you up later.

14:53.431 --> 14:55.151
Tony, I'm sorry.

15:01.670 --> 15:03.510
It's not him.

15:05.270 --> 15:06.590
It's not Max.

15:10.870 --> 15:12.670
Pericardium
looks good.

15:12.670 --> 15:14.470
Systolic's only 79.

15:14.470 --> 15:15.830
Could be
the anaesthesia.

15:15.830 --> 15:18.190
OK, hang
another litre of NS.
Do we have a repeat crit?

15:18.190 --> 15:19.470
Running it now.

15:19.470 --> 15:21.390
You guys need any help?

15:21.390 --> 15:22.750
We're fine, Andrew.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.110
Sorry, clinic's not for another
hour. I thought maybe...

15:24.110 --> 15:25.870
More gel, please.

15:25.870 --> 15:27.310
Thank you.

15:28.950 --> 15:30.270
What was that about?

15:30.270 --> 15:34.150
This is the
patient's brother.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.270
Hey, Beth, it's Richie.
I'm right here.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.270
She's been sedated.
We're helping her breathe

15:40.270 --> 15:41.470
while her body heals.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.630
I told you something like this
was gonna happen.

15:45.630 --> 15:46.550
Richie, I didn't
burn down the house.

15:46.550 --> 15:48.630
And I wasn't the one who threw
rocks at our car, either.

15:48.630 --> 15:50.350
RICHIE: But this
is because of you.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.190
My sister shouldn't
have to live like this.

15:52.190 --> 15:53.870
Morris, what do you
think that is?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.270
Could be a subcapsular
haematoma.

15:55.270 --> 15:57.310
Crit is down to 31.

15:57.310 --> 15:58.750
All right, let's get her to CT.
She might need surgery.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.350
Whoa, wait a minute. Surgery?

16:00.350 --> 16:02.190
She's got
to have surgery now?

16:02.190 --> 16:04.990
Possibly, the fall may have
caused injury to her liver.

16:04.990 --> 16:07.110
You son of a bitch.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:07.110 --> 16:09.190
No, I told her to leave you
like a year-and-a-half ago.

16:09.190 --> 16:11.470
You're a freak
and a pervert.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.470
12 years old!
12 years old, Hank,

16:13.470 --> 16:14.750
that kid was.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.110
I didn't do it, Richie.

16:16.110 --> 16:18.150
I didn't touch
that girl.

16:22.270 --> 16:24.310
How do you think
that guy get Max's bag?

16:24.310 --> 16:25.670
Probably ripped it off

16:25.670 --> 16:27.070
at a homeless shelter
or something.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.710
That's pretty lame.

16:28.710 --> 16:30.949
Look at this.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.149
Is that Max?

16:32.149 --> 16:35.229
Yeah, looks like a couple
years ago up in Tal Afar.

16:35.229 --> 16:36.709
Wow, you'd hardly
recognise him.

16:36.709 --> 16:38.309
You know what,
I'm gonna put this up

16:38.309 --> 16:39.749
at some of the firehouses.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.709
Maybe it will make someone
give a damn.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.189
Well, that's a good idea...
and after that,

16:43.189 --> 16:45.509
you're gonna let
it go, right?
I'm gonna try.

16:45.509 --> 16:47.069
Hey, Daria, did you, er, look

16:47.069 --> 16:48.509
at the X-ray
from our pneumonia guy?

16:48.509 --> 16:49.989
Yeah, line's in the SVC
near the atrium.

16:49.989 --> 16:51.989
Start him on antibiotics
and move him upstairs, OK?

16:51.989 --> 16:53.189
OK.

16:53.189 --> 16:55.389
All right, now,
show me the look.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.749
It was like this.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.429
(MIMICKING RASGOTRA)
"We're fine, Andrew."

16:58.429 --> 17:00.549
She's probably
having a bad day.

17:00.549 --> 17:01.989
Daria, did you see
the stink-eye?

17:01.989 --> 17:03.069
Look again.

17:03.069 --> 17:04.628
"We're fine, Andrew."

17:04.628 --> 17:05.829
Dude, you're cool. I promise.

17:05.829 --> 17:09.189
Did you see
the stink-eye?
Hello, Dr Rasgotra.

17:09.189 --> 17:10.469
Hi there.

17:10.469 --> 17:11.589
Hey.

17:13.269 --> 17:15.309
OK, I take it back.

17:15.309 --> 17:16.549
You're dead.

17:16.549 --> 17:18.309
Whoa, little Miss
Sunshine's mad.

17:18.309 --> 17:19.909
I'm sick of interns.

17:19.909 --> 17:21.868
Is this about that
old lady last week?

17:21.868 --> 17:23.589
Yeah, it is.
Come on. It was a mistake.

17:23.589 --> 17:25.589
It was a mistake
that cost someone their life.

17:25.589 --> 17:26.949
You know what you
need? A vacation.

17:26.949 --> 17:28.108
What are you doing
for the holidays?

17:28.108 --> 17:29.669
Well, I was thinking
of going to visit Ray,

17:29.669 --> 17:31.429
but he's going away
with his girlfriend.

17:31.429 --> 17:32.429
His girlfriend?

17:32.429 --> 17:34.509
Morris, that storage locker
in Indiana called again.

17:34.509 --> 17:36.029
They said if you
don't pay up,

17:36.029 --> 17:37.949
they're going to sell off
your dad's stuff.

17:37.949 --> 17:39.549
Even dead, my dad's
driving me crazy.

17:39.549 --> 17:40.789
Ray has a girlfriend?

17:40.789 --> 17:42.589
Yeah, he just met her
at the gym.

17:42.589 --> 17:43.829
Are you OK?
Yeah. I'm fine.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.309
I'm happy for him.
This is wonderful.

17:45.309 --> 17:46.629
Are you Neela
Rasgotra?

17:46.629 --> 17:49.029
Yeah, how can I help you?
You've been served.

17:50.869 --> 17:52.349
Is that a subpoena?

17:52.349 --> 17:54.229
Yeah, it's a medical
malpractice suit.

17:57.549 --> 17:59.749
She's going for a CAT scan

17:59.749 --> 18:01.429
of her abdomen
and pelvis.

18:01.429 --> 18:02.909
Yeah, but that could
give her cancer, right?

18:02.909 --> 18:03.709
Unlikely.

18:03.709 --> 18:05.548
We have to have it to see
if she needs surgery.

18:05.548 --> 18:06.788
You coming up,
Dr Brenner?

18:06.788 --> 18:08.108
Yeah. Did you
bring the O-neg?

18:08.108 --> 18:09.188
Right here.

18:09.188 --> 18:10.828
How long does this...
does this take?

18:10.828 --> 18:11.948
Not very long.

18:11.948 --> 18:13.828
Dr Morris, can you
check his oxygen levels

18:13.828 --> 18:14.788
while we go upstairs?

18:14.788 --> 18:16.068
I want to stay with her.

18:16.068 --> 18:17.068
We should listen
to your lungs.

18:17.068 --> 18:18.588
You can't be with her
in the scanner anyway.

18:18.588 --> 18:21.348
I'll let you know
your wife's results.
I'm OK, really.

18:21.348 --> 18:23.548
You're short of breath.
Let me check you out.

18:25.508 --> 18:26.828
(PANTS)

18:26.828 --> 18:28.108
OK.

18:29.588 --> 18:31.188
Goodbye, sweetie.

18:38.268 --> 18:39.988
Why don't you come
with us?

18:39.988 --> 18:41.988
This way.

18:45.228 --> 18:48.668
It's not true...
what he's saying about me.

18:48.668 --> 18:50.588
None of my business.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.508
I mean...
I teach music.

18:52.508 --> 18:55.468
How am I supposed to show a kid
how to play clarinet

18:55.468 --> 18:57.668
without touching their arm,
their back?

18:57.668 --> 18:59.388
What school are you at?

18:59.388 --> 19:02.188
Oak Hill Elementary.

19:02.188 --> 19:03.468
Lily, can you give me
a hand, please?

19:03.468 --> 19:05.188
No problem.

19:07.148 --> 19:09.068
One of my students came forward

19:09.068 --> 19:10.428
about a year ago.

19:10.428 --> 19:12.548
I thought it would
all be settled

19:12.548 --> 19:15.028
by a quick conversation

19:15.028 --> 19:16.428
with her and her parents,

19:16.428 --> 19:19.228
but then
the next thing I know,

19:19.228 --> 19:23.228
I'm...suspended
without pay,

19:23.228 --> 19:25.108
facing a lawsuit.

19:25.108 --> 19:27.028
Her word against yours?

19:29.028 --> 19:31.188
Then the whole neighbourhood...

19:32.748 --> 19:34.268
..went on a witch hunt.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.427
Everyone we knew...

19:38.427 --> 19:39.867
..they just...

19:41.667 --> 19:43.547
..turned against us.

19:48.267 --> 19:51.227
Can you open your mouth
for me, please? Say "ah".

19:51.227 --> 19:52.947
Ah...

19:57.987 --> 20:00.307
She said I did stuff...

20:03.867 --> 20:05.787
..made her do stuff.

20:09.387 --> 20:11.187
I have a daughter.

20:14.907 --> 20:16.947
I would never hurt a kid.

20:20.907 --> 20:23.387
I thought it would all be over

20:23.387 --> 20:27.027
when they found me not guilty,

20:27.027 --> 20:31.827
but they just kept harassing us.

20:34.147 --> 20:37.267
Now they try
to burn down our house.

20:40.307 --> 20:42.787
I-I'm sure the cops
will find out who did it.

20:42.787 --> 20:43.947
The cops...

20:43.947 --> 20:45.387
don't care.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.387
To them, I'm guilty.

20:53.907 --> 20:56.027
OK, I've got
eight clinic patients waiting,

20:56.027 --> 20:57.187
so this better be...

20:57.187 --> 20:58.427
Wow, is that your hand?

20:58.427 --> 21:01.107
OK, can you forget that?
I was hoping you could do
a quick skin biopsy.

21:01.107 --> 21:02.467
You've got to
do something.

21:02.467 --> 21:04.547
Can't you just send him
to derm clinic?

21:04.547 --> 21:06.747
They don't have an opening
until February.

21:06.747 --> 21:09.187
How long have you had this?
Don't know, for a while.

21:09.187 --> 21:10.907
Please, I'm getting
married in a month.

21:10.907 --> 21:13.386
I can't have my body
looking like this.

21:13.386 --> 21:14.546
Dr Wade,
do you have a minute?

21:14.546 --> 21:15.986
Asymmetrical,
irregular borders.

21:15.986 --> 21:17.626
He can't wait three
months for a biopsy.

21:17.626 --> 21:18.906
Yeah, er, give me a sec.

21:18.906 --> 21:20.666
Did you get one of these?
No, what is it?

21:20.666 --> 21:22.066
Bertha's family is suing.

21:22.066 --> 21:23.586
You're kidding.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.746
They said they
wouldn't do that.

21:25.746 --> 21:28.186
You talked to them?
Yeah, I felt like I had
to tell them the truth.

21:28.186 --> 21:29.426
You told them what happened?

21:29.426 --> 21:31.826
My brother's very ethical.
Daria, I can handle it.

21:31.826 --> 21:33.946
I'm just saying...
Daria. I can handle it.

21:35.866 --> 21:36.986
It was my mistake.

21:36.986 --> 21:38.786
I needed to
own up to it.

21:38.786 --> 21:41.346
This is not just about you.
What about the department?

21:41.346 --> 21:43.306
You're an intern,
you'll be protected.

21:43.306 --> 21:46.226
It's the rest of us
who are going to fry.

21:46.226 --> 21:48.466
Dr Rasgotra?

21:48.466 --> 21:49.946
Dr Rasgotra, please.

21:49.946 --> 21:51.546
< Dr Rasgotra!

21:51.546 --> 21:53.226
How'd my diverticulitis guy do?

21:53.226 --> 21:54.866
Sepsis resolved.
Was it peritonitis?

21:54.866 --> 21:57.026
Nope, just
a walled-off abscess.

21:57.026 --> 21:59.026
Hey, Mr Lotery
is wheezing clear,

21:59.026 --> 22:00.586
no carbon monoxide
on his ABG.

22:00.586 --> 22:01.706
That's too bad.

22:03.826 --> 22:04.986
OK, thanks.

22:04.986 --> 22:06.666
Your wife's still in radiology.

22:06.666 --> 22:08.106
I thought
it was a rush CT.

22:08.106 --> 22:09.746
They're backed up.
She's still in the hallway.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.026
Why don't you go
sit back down?

22:11.026 --> 22:13.506
As soon as I get an update,
I'll let you know.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.906
I had a rough night.

22:15.906 --> 22:19.146
My friend Mary Ann read my blog
and went ballistic.

22:19.146 --> 22:20.426
What did you
write about her?

22:20.426 --> 22:22.626
I just said how a certain
tall boy in gym class,

22:22.626 --> 22:24.106
who she thought
liked her...
Mm-hmm.

22:24.106 --> 22:26.466
..really doesn't like her,
and in fact likes Jean.

22:26.466 --> 22:27.986
I see.

22:27.986 --> 22:30.906
And then when I woke up,
my head was killing me.

22:30.906 --> 22:32.186
That's when you took
Acetaminophen?

22:32.186 --> 22:34.306
When I went into the
bathroom, I saw the bottle open.

22:34.306 --> 22:35.426
How many
did you take?

22:37.386 --> 22:39.626
Six?

22:39.626 --> 22:41.906
You did the right thing
by bringing her in.

22:41.906 --> 22:43.746
This way, we'll be
able to catch it

22:43.746 --> 22:44.826
in time to give you
the antidote.
Thank you.

22:44.826 --> 22:47.465
It's not going to hurt, is it?

22:47.465 --> 22:49.425
You'll be fine.
Lean forward.
Take a deep breath.

22:49.425 --> 22:51.305
GI consult, LFTs,
and four-hour Tylenol level?

22:51.305 --> 22:52.345
Yeah, and start with mucomyst.

22:52.345 --> 22:54.225
We can't be sure until
we get the labs back.

22:54.225 --> 22:55.745
How long is this going
to take?

22:55.745 --> 22:57.465
I just need to go call my job
and tell them I won't be in.

22:57.465 --> 22:59.945
Phone's at the desk or you
can use your cell outside.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.505
OK, I'll be right back,
sweetie.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.625
So tell me more about this blog.

23:04.985 --> 23:06.705
Why would Andrew do that?

23:06.705 --> 23:08.145
All the research says
when you're honest

23:08.145 --> 23:10.065
with patient families
about your mistakes,

23:10.065 --> 23:11.345
they are less likely to sue.

23:11.345 --> 23:13.145
Look, I'll speak to Anspaugh

23:13.145 --> 23:14.865
and I bet
it'll get tossed out.

23:14.865 --> 23:16.105
Yeah, it'd better,

23:16.105 --> 23:17.945
or else I'll be doing the Ho stroll
down on Division street.

23:17.945 --> 23:19.505
The what?
Forget it.

23:19.505 --> 23:21.705
Doctors.
Oh, hey.

23:21.705 --> 23:24.465
I've only been here a month,
and I already have an enemy.

23:24.465 --> 23:25.745
I don't get enemies.

23:25.745 --> 23:27.785
Jeff Davis hates you. Fourth grade -
you stepped on his frog.

23:27.785 --> 23:30.025
It jumped under my shoe.
Remember?
Hey, what's up, guys?

23:30.025 --> 23:32.145
Hey.
We're having a pity party.

23:32.145 --> 23:34.105
More attending problems?

23:34.105 --> 23:35.625
Andrew told the family
he made a mistake.

23:35.625 --> 23:37.105
Now they're suing.

23:37.105 --> 23:38.665
Do you think what
you did was right?

23:38.665 --> 23:40.185
I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.225
Well, then, man up,
go in there, and kick ass.

23:42.225 --> 23:43.745
Yeah?
Yeah, the more
you rock it,

23:43.745 --> 23:45.905
the less likely they are
to remember last week.

23:45.905 --> 23:47.105
She's got a point.

23:47.105 --> 23:48.505
Damn right I do.

23:48.505 --> 23:50.385
If you keep acting
all soft and wimpy,

23:50.385 --> 23:52.385
we'll throw you
out of the crew.
We have a crew?

23:52.385 --> 23:54.425
I can't find your mom

23:54.425 --> 23:56.265
and we need to draw
your blood level now.

23:56.265 --> 23:59.625
Sure. Just get it over with.

24:03.185 --> 24:04.425
Ow.

24:04.425 --> 24:07.785
(CHUCKLING) Relax, I haven't
done anything yet.

24:07.785 --> 24:08.985
I hate needles.

24:08.985 --> 24:10.705
Can't you wait
till her mom comes back?

24:10.705 --> 24:14.665
The blood has to be drawn
four hours after ingestion.

24:14.665 --> 24:17.185
She took the pills at 9.00,
so now is the time.

24:17.185 --> 24:19.105
I'll go find her mom.

24:19.105 --> 24:21.705
No, please! Just stay here.

24:21.705 --> 24:23.744
I can do it.

24:30.824 --> 24:32.504
(GASPS)

24:32.504 --> 24:34.344
Oh, whoa, whoa.
You're OK.

24:34.344 --> 24:36.104
What school
do you go to?

24:36.104 --> 24:38.224
Claflin Elementary,
over on Lincoln.

24:38.224 --> 24:39.664
Ah...

24:39.664 --> 24:40.904
(MOUTHS)

24:40.904 --> 24:43.304
I'm friends
with your principal.

24:43.304 --> 24:45.944
He's really nice.
He's a great guy.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.104
We used to be in
a band together. Would you
do me a favour?

24:48.104 --> 24:49.464
Would you tell him
the next time

24:49.464 --> 24:51.184
you see him
that Henry Lotery says hello?

24:51.184 --> 24:53.064
DOOR BUZZER

24:53.064 --> 24:55.824
Sir, what are you doing?!

24:56.664 --> 24:59.824
Step back.
Are you crazy?

24:59.824 --> 25:01.304
It's not what you think.

25:01.304 --> 25:03.344
You need to move.

25:03.344 --> 25:05.584
You piece of crap.
(GRUNTS)

25:05.584 --> 25:07.024
Twisted bastard.

25:07.024 --> 25:08.664
I'll kill you.

25:10.224 --> 25:11.624
He was helping me.
Security!

25:14.584 --> 25:17.144
OK, OK, OK. That's enough!
that's enough!

25:17.144 --> 25:20.064
All right, all right,
all right, I'm good.

25:20.064 --> 25:22.304
I didn't do anything.

25:22.304 --> 25:24.064
I need some help here!

25:25.544 --> 25:27.424
(GRUNTS)

25:27.424 --> 25:28.784
(MUMBLES)

25:28.784 --> 25:30.824
I didn't do it.

26:17.023 --> 26:19.783
When everyone's shouting about
lowering prices,

26:19.903 --> 26:21.823
it's reassuring to know that,
on Monday,

26:21.903 --> 26:23.183
the Independent Price Check

26:23.303 --> 26:25.823
compared thousands
of branded products.

26:25.943 --> 26:28.423
They found that Asda
were cheaper on this many.

26:29.183 --> 26:30.223
Morrisons?

26:30.303 --> 26:31.743
Well, judge for yourself.

26:37.903 --> 26:39.663
Saturday.

26:39.783 --> 26:42.103
Time to celebrate
the death of the week.

26:43.303 --> 26:46.903
Time to ponder the miracle
that is egg.

26:48.343 --> 26:50.583
Time for pancakes.

26:50.663 --> 26:52.263
Why just once a year?

26:54.463 --> 26:55.703
Or toast -

26:55.823 --> 26:58.263
a granary canvas
for a million toppings.

27:01.023 --> 27:04.063
Saturday breakfast
deserves the best.

27:04.143 --> 27:05.703
Give it Lurpak.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.343
Latte...

27:08.943 --> 27:10.543
not to go!

29:07.862 --> 29:09.021
GLASSES CLATTER

29:10.021 --> 29:10.981
Cluck!

29:11.061 --> 29:12.381
Milk!

29:12.461 --> 29:14.421
Milk, mmm!

29:14.501 --> 29:16.461
Milk, milk!

29:16.701 --> 29:17.661
Mmm!

29:18.621 --> 29:19.301
Mmm!

29:19.421 --> 29:21.101
- Milk, milk!
- No more!

29:21.741 --> 29:22.701
Mmm-hmm.

29:22.781 --> 29:24.541
(bellows) Oh!

29:25.701 --> 29:26.941
PING!
Oh!

29:27.381 --> 29:28.541
PING!
Whoa!

29:29.341 --> 29:30.581
Ohh!

29:30.661 --> 29:31.621
Ooh!

29:33.101 --> 29:34.341
- Grr!
- (giggles)

30:36.021 --> 30:38.221
Scalp bleeder.
I need a Raney clip.

30:38.221 --> 30:40.061
No-one wants to believe me.
Brisk epistaxis.

30:40.061 --> 30:41.901
Going to put some pressure
on your nose, sir.

30:41.901 --> 30:43.701
What's the point of going
through the system?

30:43.701 --> 30:44.700
Tachy at 120.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.420
You need help in here?
We're fine.

30:46.420 --> 30:48.020
I'll give you a hand
with the access.

30:48.020 --> 30:50.660
Hey, I don't want him
working on me!

30:50.660 --> 30:52.020
Go.

30:52.020 --> 30:54.100
When the cops are done
with the brother-in-law,

30:54.100 --> 30:57.020
they may need
to talk to you, too.

30:57.020 --> 30:59.980
Dr Brenner, Dr Brenner, I've
got a complex lip laceration.

30:59.980 --> 31:02.180
Align the vermilion border
with six-oh.

31:02.180 --> 31:03.980
But I haven't
done it before.
Well, you should have.

31:03.980 --> 31:06.060
Simon, I could use your help.

31:06.060 --> 31:08.780
Just get Dr Gates
to help you.

31:08.780 --> 31:10.020
Looks like a flail chest

31:10.020 --> 31:11.620
with diminished breath sounds
bilaterally.

31:11.620 --> 31:12.860
This the chopper run?

31:12.860 --> 31:14.780
Tasha Overbrook,
auto versus pedestrian.

31:14.780 --> 31:15.620
Pulse weak and thready.

31:15.620 --> 31:18.260
She needs bilateral
chest tubes ASAP.

31:18.260 --> 31:21.340
I was on my way to my first date
with this guy I met on Facebook.

31:21.340 --> 31:23.500
Open an intubation tray
while you're at it.

31:23.500 --> 31:24.860
And a car came out of nowhere
and hit me.

31:24.860 --> 31:26.300
Trauma panel.
Get two of O-neg.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.940
If I die on the day I'm supposed
to meet my husband...

31:28.940 --> 31:31.020
One, two, three.
(GROANS)

31:31.020 --> 31:32.540
You know when the last time
I got kissed was?

31:32.540 --> 31:34.780
Let's concentrate on
getting you better.

31:34.780 --> 31:37.500
Neela, we need you in here -
possible orbital blowout.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.500
It's going to
have to wait.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.140
Check an intraocular
pressure.

31:40.140 --> 31:41.980
It could be worse.
Maybe a surgical eye.

31:41.980 --> 31:43.340
I was in there.
He was awake and alert.

31:43.340 --> 31:45.140
This lady's
more critical.

31:45.140 --> 31:46.780
Did you try Dubenko
or Crenshaw?

31:46.780 --> 31:48.260
They're both in the OR.
Where's your intern?

31:48.260 --> 31:49.860
One percent with
Lido, 32 French.

31:49.860 --> 31:51.260
80/40.

31:51.260 --> 31:53.980
Neela, I need a hand.
Ten blade.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.740
Neela!
Call Andrew.

31:55.740 --> 31:57.940
Tell him
I need him right now.

31:57.940 --> 32:00.020
Mitch Kellems - twisted his ankle
after getting into a fight.

32:00.020 --> 32:01.900
Hi, I'm Dr Gates.

32:01.900 --> 32:04.100
I was just passing out
my coupons

32:04.100 --> 32:06.140
and some vegans came up
and started talking smack.

32:06.140 --> 32:07.260
Can you wiggle
your toes?

32:07.260 --> 32:09.860
I can wiggle my toes,
but my giblets kind of hurt.

32:09.860 --> 32:12.260
Neurovascularly intact.

32:12.260 --> 32:14.540
Curtain four's open.
All right, good,
give him ten of morphine

32:14.540 --> 32:16.900
and a knee series
with a sunrise view.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.099
I saw that picture
you had posted in the station.

32:19.099 --> 32:20.459
Max Gonzalez?

32:20.459 --> 32:22.099
I think I might have seen
him a couple nights ago

32:22.099 --> 32:23.539
in front of Benny's Liquor
over on Halsted.

32:23.539 --> 32:26.579
He had passed out,
but when we got there,
he didn't want to come in.

32:26.579 --> 32:28.259
All he kept
yapping about

32:28.259 --> 32:29.579
was how he lost
his bag or something.

32:32.859 --> 32:35.139
I still don't have
a BP on this girl.

32:35.139 --> 32:35.859
Two units are up.

32:37.659 --> 32:40.499
What are you doing?
I'm hooking up
my central line.

32:40.499 --> 32:42.539
Don't you want blood
from the infuser?

32:42.539 --> 32:44.539
Right.

32:44.539 --> 32:46.699
You all right?

32:46.699 --> 32:48.939
Yeah. I'm fine.

32:50.059 --> 32:52.179
They said you wanted me in here.
Yeah.

32:52.179 --> 32:54.659
Go in next door and see
if he needs the OR.
Me?

32:54.659 --> 32:55.499
Yes. You.

32:55.499 --> 32:56.859
Sure, no problem.

32:56.859 --> 32:59.419
Get the T-pod. It's a
bad pelvic fracture.

32:59.419 --> 33:01.099
Large haematoma
behind the eye.

33:01.099 --> 33:03.219
I can't see a thing.
I'm going blind.

33:03.219 --> 33:05.099
Your optic nerve
is getting compressed.

33:05.099 --> 33:06.859
The anterior packing's
not helping.

33:06.859 --> 33:08.179
He lost a couple of units.

33:08.179 --> 33:10.099
Uh, Neela, vision loss from
a retrobulbar haematoma.

33:10.099 --> 33:11.179
He's bleeding out
from posterior epistaxis.

33:11.179 --> 33:12.819
The blood is going
down my throat.

33:12.819 --> 33:14.499
Frazier tip suction.

33:14.499 --> 33:17.259
OK, Gottschalk the nose
and do a lateral canthotomy.

33:17.259 --> 33:18.259
(GASPS)

33:18.259 --> 33:20.619
OK, er, you sure
you don't want to switch?

33:20.619 --> 33:22.459
Come on. Somebody do something.

33:22.459 --> 33:23.859
(HALEH) Systolic's
down to 60.

33:23.859 --> 33:25.459
You're going to have to do it.

33:25.459 --> 33:27.459
Heart rate's 42.
Amp of atropine.

33:27.459 --> 33:29.859
OK, let's go to Angio
before she arrests.

33:31.019 --> 33:32.619
Ugh.

33:32.619 --> 33:35.099
Please don't make me
drink more of that stuff.

33:35.099 --> 33:36.979
Well, hopefully,
you won't have to.

33:36.979 --> 33:38.779
If your Acetaminophen level
is low enough,

33:38.779 --> 33:39.899
you'll be able to go home.

33:39.899 --> 33:41.579
Is that man OK?

33:41.579 --> 33:43.699
They're still working on him.

33:43.699 --> 33:44.979
Don't worry.

33:44.979 --> 33:47.019
When are those results
going to be back?

33:47.019 --> 33:49.419
Soon. I'm going to go
call the lab.

33:53.059 --> 33:54.658
Where are you going?

33:54.658 --> 33:56.858
To find his mind.
Clearly, he's lost it.

33:56.858 --> 33:58.458
Zadro saw Max on Halsted.

33:58.458 --> 34:00.858
Are you kidding?
No.

34:02.298 --> 34:04.338
Tony, I'm working,
and so are you.

34:04.338 --> 34:05.498
Take a half hour.

34:05.498 --> 34:06.898
What are you doing?

34:06.898 --> 34:09.858
You didn't go chasing
after the diabetic patient
who left last week

34:09.858 --> 34:12.338
or the AIDS patient
who went AMA this morning.

34:12.338 --> 34:13.498
This is different.

34:13.498 --> 34:14.978
Why, cos
he's military?
You know what?

34:14.978 --> 34:18.297
You don't understand.
No, I don't.
Cos you won't let me in.

34:18.297 --> 34:19.858
All night long,
you're tossing and turning.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.178
Every morning you're calling
veteran advocacy groups

34:22.178 --> 34:23.978
and homeless shelters.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.538
It's not like you served
with this guy...

34:25.538 --> 34:27.818
Sam, either you're going
with me or not.

34:40.178 --> 34:42.378
T-pod's tightened
as far as it goes.

34:42.378 --> 34:44.458
OK, ask the blood bank
to stay ahead eight units.

34:44.458 --> 34:45.458
I passed the Gottschalk.
Now what?

34:45.458 --> 34:46.418
I can't breathe.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.018
Pulse ox 97.

34:48.018 --> 34:50.737
Inflate the posterior balloon
with eight cc's of water.

34:50.737 --> 34:52.058
Ten-cc syringe.
Here you go.

34:52.058 --> 34:53.018
Chest tube bandage
is loose.

34:53.018 --> 34:54.338
Oh, God.

34:54.338 --> 34:57.218
We're getting
an air leak.
OK, just keep a hand on it.

34:57.218 --> 34:58.978
I'll go and get
some elastoplast.

34:58.978 --> 35:00.978
< It's going in.

35:00.978 --> 35:02.338
Then 20cc anterior.

35:02.338 --> 35:03.858
Slowly.

35:04.978 --> 35:06.698
(GASPS)

35:06.698 --> 35:07.978
Both balloons are up.

35:09.578 --> 35:12.338
Oropharynx looks dry.
I think you got it.

35:14.378 --> 35:16.218
RUMBLING

35:20.498 --> 35:22.898
I need to get
this girl to Angio.

35:22.898 --> 35:24.338
I could use some help
with the canthotomy.

35:26.018 --> 35:27.258
Lost the pulse.

35:27.258 --> 35:28.938
I'll bag.
Starting compressions.

35:28.938 --> 35:30.977
Thoracotomy tray.

35:30.977 --> 35:32.977
Can we wait for Neela
to assist?

35:32.977 --> 35:34.657
No. You can do it.
Come on. Help me.

35:34.657 --> 35:37.497
Another five minutes,
we're looking at permanent blindness.

35:37.497 --> 35:38.777
Lidos ready.

35:38.777 --> 35:40.497
Sir, I need to numb up
the side of your eye.

35:40.497 --> 35:42.257
Yankauer.

35:42.257 --> 35:44.257
Two units type specific.

35:44.257 --> 35:47.337
Neela, major haematemesis. You think
it's just swallowed blood?

35:47.337 --> 35:48.697
It's a good possibility.

35:48.697 --> 35:50.737
Maybe it's from the increased
intraocular pressure.

35:50.737 --> 35:51.577
Or he's exsanguinating
from a GI bleed.

35:51.577 --> 35:54.297
Only one way to tell.
Haemostat and iris scissors.

35:54.297 --> 35:55.697
I'm gonna open the eye socket.

36:11.217 --> 36:13.977
SIRENS

36:24.737 --> 36:26.857
BELL RINGS

36:27.897 --> 36:29.857
Hey.

36:29.857 --> 36:31.497
Lotto just closed.

36:31.497 --> 36:32.737
You seen this guy?

36:34.817 --> 36:36.897
Nah, can't say I have.

36:36.897 --> 36:38.937
I heard he fell asleep
out on your sidewalk,

36:38.937 --> 36:40.977
and you called the paramedics.
You know where he is?

36:40.977 --> 36:43.737
I don't follow 'em with GPS.

36:43.737 --> 36:46.257
I just try to keep 'em away
from the front door.

36:46.257 --> 36:48.217
Oh, yeah.

36:48.217 --> 36:50.217
How about this guy?

36:50.217 --> 36:52.857
Does he look familiar?

36:52.857 --> 36:54.457
That the same guy?

36:56.537 --> 36:58.697
I wish I could help you.

37:03.537 --> 37:04.736
ANDREW:
He's numb.

37:04.736 --> 37:06.176
TRACY:
And he's out
with four of versed.

37:06.176 --> 37:08.536
Crimp the skin
at the lateral corner.

37:12.096 --> 37:13.456
You're prepped and ready.

37:13.456 --> 37:15.096
You feeling OK?

37:15.096 --> 37:16.136
Yeah, I'm good.

37:16.136 --> 37:17.656
We can get someone
to cover for you.

37:17.656 --> 37:18.856
I'm fine.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.656
What's next?

37:25.656 --> 37:27.136
Iris scissors.

37:27.136 --> 37:28.976
Two-centimetre cut.

37:31.776 --> 37:33.856
GRADY:
Ten blade's ready.

37:33.856 --> 37:36.656
Hold on. I've got
a femoral pulse.

37:36.656 --> 37:38.936
That feels pretty strong.

37:38.936 --> 37:40.216
Maybe we got ahead
of the bleeding.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.256
Try for a BP.

37:43.416 --> 37:46.336
Incision's done, but the eye
pressure's still way up.

37:46.336 --> 37:49.696
Cut the inferior crux
of the lateral canthus tendon.

37:49.696 --> 37:51.536
You're going to have
to dissect down a bit.
Great.

37:55.376 --> 37:57.776
Neela, if you have a minute,

37:57.776 --> 37:59.296
I think we could use
your help in here.

37:59.296 --> 38:00.936
Sorry. I can't.
Keep the blood pouring in

38:00.936 --> 38:02.336
with platelets and Factor 7a.

38:02.336 --> 38:05.096
Let's get her to Angio and bring
a thoracotomy tray.

38:05.096 --> 38:06.656
I still may have to open her up.

38:06.656 --> 38:08.136
Retract the inferior
lid downward.

38:08.136 --> 38:09.536
MORRIS:
Got it.

38:09.536 --> 38:10.576
That's either

38:10.576 --> 38:12.176
a tendon or an arteriole.

38:12.176 --> 38:13.856
You better be sure
it's a tendon.

38:13.856 --> 38:15.136
Well, should I?

38:18.416 --> 38:19.736
I'm cutting.

38:21.616 --> 38:23.416
Did he bag the artery?

38:23.416 --> 38:25.656
The bleeding stops,
we're out of the woods.

38:27.976 --> 38:29.616
Haematoma's drained.
We did it, Neela.

38:29.616 --> 38:30.816
RASGOTRA:
Congratulations.

38:30.816 --> 38:32.816
Get him to CT.
We're off to Angio.

38:32.816 --> 38:34.456
I've got the infuser.
Why don't you stay here.

38:34.456 --> 38:35.536
We got it.

38:56.215 --> 38:58.175
Hey!

39:00.095 --> 39:02.175
You want a ride?

39:02.175 --> 39:04.655
So I'm doing my show,
laying down my normal knowledge,

39:04.655 --> 39:07.135
and this guy calls in and says,
"Shut up. The economy's fine!"

39:07.135 --> 39:09.175
I say, "Come on, now. You know
the economy's not fine."

39:09.175 --> 39:10.695
And then he breaks
into this long monologue

39:10.695 --> 39:11.855
about how we're
really the ones

39:11.855 --> 39:13.175
that are screwing
everything up.

39:13.175 --> 39:15.135
And I said, "Seriously,
dude, have you been living

39:15.135 --> 39:16.455
"under a rock for the
last eight years?"

39:16.455 --> 39:18.255
And...oh, God, my left
arm's hurting again.

39:18.255 --> 39:20.175
OK, just take a deep breath.

39:21.255 --> 39:23.295
I can't stay here long.

39:23.295 --> 39:24.695
I got to tape some
commercials tonight.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.735
I need to check some labs.

39:26.735 --> 39:28.975
This whole political season's
been way too stressful.

39:28.975 --> 39:31.015
Well, thank goodness
it's over.

39:31.015 --> 39:32.895
It's not over.
I'm on five days a week.

39:32.895 --> 39:34.495
Well, you might need
to take a break.

39:34.495 --> 39:36.575
That is unless you want
to be doing a radio show up there.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.535
You have a recording
studio upstairs?

39:41.935 --> 39:43.575
What?

39:43.575 --> 39:45.175
You mean I could die?

39:45.175 --> 39:46.975
Well, we're all dying.

39:46.975 --> 39:48.495
Stress just gets you
there faster.

39:48.495 --> 39:50.775
Let me get a nurse
to draw your blood.

39:51.855 --> 39:53.695
Hey.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.335
Hey.

39:55.335 --> 39:57.055
You all right?

39:57.055 --> 39:59.055
They moved Henry's wife
out of recovery.

39:59.055 --> 40:01.055
That's good.
And into the ICU.

40:01.055 --> 40:02.695
She needed
another two units.

40:02.695 --> 40:04.215
Oh, OK.

40:04.215 --> 40:06.895
Well, I got to finish up with this
patient, but maybe we can talk?

40:06.895 --> 40:08.255
About what?

40:08.255 --> 40:09.535
You're kidding me,
right?
It's not my fault.

40:09.535 --> 40:10.855
The street sign says
no parking.

40:10.855 --> 40:12.535
Well, what'd she think,
I made the sign?

40:12.535 --> 40:14.174
It's my job.
Gary Jones.

40:14.174 --> 40:16.174
Punched in the face
during an altercation.

40:16.174 --> 40:17.694
Tender and swollen
over the zygoma.

40:17.694 --> 40:19.614
Once I start the ticket,
I can't stop it.

40:19.614 --> 40:21.534
It's in the system.
OK, why don't we, er,

40:21.534 --> 40:23.494
take him to, er,
Curtain 2. We'll do
a facial series.

40:23.494 --> 40:26.094
I'm pregnant and this jerk
won't let me get my vitamins

40:26.094 --> 40:28.374
in peace!
She's the one that got into it
with the parking guy.

40:28.374 --> 40:29.614
Fell with a knee
abrasion.

40:29.614 --> 40:31.134
All right, let's move her
to exam 3.

40:31.134 --> 40:33.534
What does he want me to do?
Park around the corner?

40:33.534 --> 40:34.574
I don't make the rules!

40:34.574 --> 40:37.694
What type of man writes parking
tickets anyway, you wuss!

40:37.694 --> 40:39.214
Get a real job!

40:39.214 --> 40:40.494
I'll catch up
with you later.
Yeah.

40:40.494 --> 40:41.894
If my kid grows up
to be like him,

40:41.894 --> 40:43.654
I am dropping him off in Omaha.
You hear me?

40:43.654 --> 40:45.334
I will disown him!

40:45.334 --> 40:46.654
(SIGHS)

40:49.734 --> 40:51.734
What are you starting?

40:51.734 --> 40:53.414
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

40:53.414 --> 40:55.214
Ah, with an
endovascular stent?

40:55.214 --> 40:56.734
That's the plan.

40:56.734 --> 40:59.334
Well, if you need an
extra set of hands,

40:59.334 --> 41:00.654
I'm free.
I'll be fine.

41:00.654 --> 41:02.894
I should be in and out
in an hour or so.

41:02.894 --> 41:05.094
So rumour has it that, er,

41:05.094 --> 41:07.054
Andrew did
a lateral canthotomy.

41:07.054 --> 41:08.854
He did.

41:08.854 --> 41:09.774
Hmm. By himself?

41:09.774 --> 41:12.734
Well, actually,
I walked him through it.

41:12.734 --> 41:13.974
Oh, you taught him.

41:13.974 --> 41:15.734
I thought Mighty Mouse
worked alone.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.134
Well, I was with
an unstable patient.

41:17.134 --> 41:18.774
There was no way
I could do it.

41:18.774 --> 41:20.254
So I assisted him
through the other room.

41:20.254 --> 41:22.134
So he was receptive
to your knowledge.

41:22.134 --> 41:24.574
He was, um, a little nervous,

41:24.574 --> 41:26.534
but he was able to incise
the canthus tendon

41:26.534 --> 41:27.894
and relieve the pressure.

41:27.894 --> 41:31.294
I'm surprised
the patient isn't blind.

41:31.294 --> 41:32.294
What?

41:32.294 --> 41:33.494
Well, yeah.

41:33.494 --> 41:35.574
An inexperienced surgeon
can rupture the globe.

41:37.654 --> 41:39.414
OK, you've made your point.

41:39.414 --> 41:40.694
I'm sorry.

41:40.694 --> 41:42.494
I probably didn't react
very well earlier.

41:42.494 --> 41:44.494
Good, because I was
beginning to wonder

41:44.494 --> 41:45.894
why I'd waste all my time
teaching you

41:45.894 --> 41:46.934
all these years.

41:46.934 --> 41:48.574
I was never like that.

41:48.574 --> 41:51.133
Right. I seem to remember
a blown triple-a

41:51.133 --> 41:52.533
you almost sent home.
Yeah, and then

41:52.533 --> 41:54.213
there was the phrenic nerve
I stopped you

41:54.213 --> 41:55.213
from cutting.
Lucien.

41:55.213 --> 41:56.333
And let's not forget
the case

41:56.333 --> 41:57.573
where you cross-clamped
the oesophagus...

41:57.573 --> 41:59.253
What, are you keeping
score? I get it!

41:59.253 --> 42:00.293
Who do you think you are?

42:00.293 --> 42:02.133
Dr Dubenko,

42:02.133 --> 42:04.853
er, we're ready.

42:04.853 --> 42:07.013
The reason they call this
a teaching hospital

42:07.013 --> 42:09.293
is because this is
where doctors give back.

42:09.293 --> 42:11.013
If you're only interested

42:11.013 --> 42:12.813
in becoming a rock star,
Dr Rasgotra,

42:12.813 --> 42:16.813
I suggest you look elsewhere.
We don't need you here.

44:57.172 --> 45:00.731
When something soft and beautiful
loses only a little moisture

45:00.811 --> 45:02.691
it becomes visibly rough.

45:02.811 --> 45:06.651
Dove keeps in 17% more of
your underarm skin's vital moisture

45:06.731 --> 45:08.171
than ordinary deodorants,

45:08.251 --> 45:10.731
for visibly softer and smoother skin

45:10.811 --> 45:12.931
and, of course, 24-hour protection.

45:13.011 --> 45:14.571
Can your deodorant do that?

45:18.611 --> 45:20.851
We know you don't
really want to beat the system,

45:20.971 --> 45:22.411
just want it to work.

45:24.091 --> 45:27.411
We know you don't
really enjoy complaining.

45:29.531 --> 45:32.531
We too believe the most important
part of a home

45:32.651 --> 45:34.891
is the people inside.

45:35.011 --> 45:36.371
Make a stand

45:36.491 --> 45:37.971
with AXA's home insurance,

45:38.131 --> 45:40.411
and get your own
dedicated claim handler

45:40.571 --> 45:42.451
if your home
is damaged by water.

46:47.410 --> 46:48.610
We're driving around in circles.

46:48.610 --> 46:50.170
I know. Make a right up here,
at this next street.

46:50.170 --> 46:52.010
Tony, this is getting absurd.

46:52.010 --> 46:53.810
You know, if you didn't want
to help, then why did you come?

46:53.810 --> 46:55.250
Because I'm worried
about you.

46:55.250 --> 46:57.290
Don't worry about me.
Just drive me.

47:01.930 --> 47:03.410
I'm sorry, Sam.

47:03.410 --> 47:06.010
I'm sorry.

47:09.610 --> 47:11.610
(SIGHS)

47:11.610 --> 47:13.170
I told you about Keith, right?

47:13.170 --> 47:14.410
Sarah's dad?

47:14.410 --> 47:16.250
Yeah.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.690
When we got back from the Gulf,
we were so messed up.

47:18.690 --> 47:20.890
Nobody cared about us.
Nobody gave a damn.

47:20.890 --> 47:24.970
We had no plans. We had no goals, so
we just...we cut loose.

47:24.970 --> 47:28.450
We got high all the time
and drank like crazy.

47:28.450 --> 47:30.850
You were young, it happens.

47:30.850 --> 47:35.250
No. Keith started having
these nightmares, you know.

47:35.250 --> 47:36.810
Alcohol would make them go away.

47:36.810 --> 47:39.250
He'd get aggressive
and angry, and then,

47:39.250 --> 47:41.450
one night,
he just snapped.

47:41.450 --> 47:43.490
He punched Meg so hard
in the face,

47:43.490 --> 47:45.730
she flew across the room.

47:45.730 --> 47:47.530
Was Sarah there?

47:47.530 --> 47:48.730
Yeah.

47:48.730 --> 47:50.170
She saw everything.

47:50.170 --> 47:52.970
Instead of asking him
what's wrong, or, you know,

47:52.970 --> 47:56.170
finding out if I could help him,
I just, I said,

47:56.170 --> 47:57.970
"Get the hell out.
You're not my problem any more."

47:57.970 --> 48:03.090
And although, I was trying
to protect Meg and Sarah, I...

48:03.090 --> 48:06.850
I turned my back
on my best friend.

48:06.850 --> 48:10.289
And then two days later,
he OD'd.

48:14.209 --> 48:16.769
So, I'd really like
to try to find this guy.

48:16.769 --> 48:19.209
OK.

48:22.089 --> 48:25.049
Well, we got good news -
no brain bleed,

48:25.049 --> 48:26.809
and the eye surgery
took all the pressure

48:26.809 --> 48:28.289
off the optic nerve.

48:28.289 --> 48:29.609
My vision's better.

48:29.609 --> 48:31.209
Good. That's
what I like to hear.

48:31.209 --> 48:32.689
How's my wife?

48:32.689 --> 48:35.089
Uh, they repaired injuries
to the liver and spleen. She's doing
well in recovery.

48:35.089 --> 48:36.969
Good, that's good.

48:38.889 --> 48:42.209
That doctor had no right
to touch me.

48:42.209 --> 48:44.409
I was helping that girl.

48:44.409 --> 48:46.049
I'll speak to him.

48:46.049 --> 48:47.329
(SCOFFS)

48:47.329 --> 48:50.929
You gonna speak
to the jerks who
hurt my wife, too?

48:54.849 --> 48:58.369
You know, you guys
got lucky today.

48:58.369 --> 49:00.729
It could've been
far worse.

49:00.729 --> 49:04.369
And it might be next time.

49:06.089 --> 49:09.569
I'd leave here in a minute,

49:09.569 --> 49:12.609
move someplace else...

49:12.609 --> 49:18.449
but my wife grew up
in that house. Her parents are
in a nursing home three miles away.

49:18.449 --> 49:21.489
I know, I understand...
She owns a card shop
around the corner.

49:21.489 --> 49:25.329
She's not gonna go.

49:26.849 --> 49:29.889
Umbrella girl tolerated fluids,
going home with PMD follow-up.

49:29.889 --> 49:31.209
That's great.

49:31.209 --> 49:33.729
I didn't think she was
going to make it.

49:33.729 --> 49:35.209
You all right?
what happened in there?

49:35.209 --> 49:36.529
I'm just having
a bad day.

49:36.529 --> 49:37.929
I'm the one
who's getting served.

49:37.929 --> 49:39.489
Want to talk about it?
No, it's OK.

49:39.489 --> 49:41.409
Oh, and Crohn's CT is
negative for abscess.

49:41.409 --> 49:44.968
OK. Pulse with steroids
and have GI see him next week.

49:44.968 --> 49:47.768
I'll talk to you later.

49:47.768 --> 49:49.888
He's acting strange.

49:49.888 --> 49:51.808
Kind of. I don't know

49:53.648 --> 49:55.208
You kicked ass
in there.

49:55.208 --> 49:56.528
I rocked it, huh?

49:56.528 --> 49:58.048
Yeah. Neela can't say Jack now.
Excuse me, Dr Martin.

49:58.048 --> 49:59.368
Oh, Dr Rasgotra.

49:59.368 --> 50:02.088
Uh, we were about to go get
drinks to celebrate...

50:02.088 --> 50:04.208
the team's victory,
and we were hoping

50:04.208 --> 50:05.488
you'd join us.

50:05.488 --> 50:06.888
I'll pass. Andrew,
do you have a second?

50:06.888 --> 50:09.328
Yeah. Thank you
for trusting me in there,

50:09.328 --> 50:10.888
Doctor...
..and for guiding me
and teaching me.

50:10.888 --> 50:12.128
That's what
I'm supposed to do.

50:12.128 --> 50:14.048
And about last week, I...

50:14.048 --> 50:15.688
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

50:15.688 --> 50:17.728
I didn't realise
that what's right for me

50:17.728 --> 50:19.008
may not be right for the team.

50:19.008 --> 50:22.048
Look, I admire your empathy
for Bertha's family.

50:22.048 --> 50:23.168
Your emotional impulse
was correct,

50:23.168 --> 50:24.688
but next time,
talk to me or Dubenko

50:24.688 --> 50:26.288
before you approach the family.

50:26.288 --> 50:27.248
That's why we're here.

50:27.248 --> 50:28.608
I got it.

50:28.608 --> 50:30.288
Now go have yourself a drink.

50:30.288 --> 50:32.128
You did kind of rock it today.

50:32.128 --> 50:33.888
Thank you.

50:36.488 --> 50:39.368
Hey, I was looking for you.

50:39.368 --> 50:41.408
What was up
with you today?

50:41.408 --> 50:43.648
You know that guy could throw
a lawsuit at us.

50:43.648 --> 50:46.488
You Americans sure love to sue.

50:46.488 --> 50:48.288
You think
this is funny?

50:48.288 --> 50:49.328
He was proven innocent.

50:49.328 --> 50:50.768
So what?
what does that mean?

50:50.768 --> 50:52.448
It means he has the right
to get treatment at a hospital

50:52.448 --> 50:53.528
without getting
roughed up by doctors.

50:53.528 --> 50:54.888
What if he goes
to Anspaugh or the Board?

50:54.888 --> 50:56.128
What then?

50:56.128 --> 50:58.288
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

50:58.288 --> 50:59.568
What are you talking about?

50:59.568 --> 51:00.888
That guy's guilty.

51:00.888 --> 51:02.208
We don't know that.

51:02.208 --> 51:04.048
I know what he is.

51:04.048 --> 51:06.568
What? What do you...?
What do you know...?

51:14.128 --> 51:17.608
Did something happen to you?

51:25.287 --> 51:28.487
I was ten...

51:28.487 --> 51:30.567
the first time.

51:34.447 --> 51:36.727
My mother was wild,

51:36.727 --> 51:40.727
you know the type
everyone wants to be around...

51:40.727 --> 51:44.647
and she'd throw
these...these parties.

51:47.647 --> 51:51.007
They'd start on a Friday,
and they'd last till the Sunday.

51:52.727 --> 51:57.447
There, there was
this one guy...

51:57.447 --> 51:59.447
Bobby.

52:02.447 --> 52:04.727
He was older...

52:04.727 --> 52:06.447
grey moustache.

52:09.327 --> 52:12.007
He'd always buy my mom
this cheap wine,

52:12.007 --> 52:16.487
and he'd give me
those little candies that
were stuck on the paper.

52:21.647 --> 52:24.207
And when the parties
were going on,

52:24.207 --> 52:26.767
he'd sometimes hang out
in my room.

52:28.447 --> 52:32.487
Did you tell anybody
about this?

52:33.767 --> 52:39.127
No. My dad was long gone,
and my mom...

52:39.127 --> 52:43.607
she was unconscious
half the time, so...

52:52.047 --> 52:54.606
They appear to be nice, Archie.

52:54.606 --> 52:55.806
That's what they do.

53:03.726 --> 53:06.486
Hi. I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

53:08.446 --> 53:10.686
That's very sweet of you.

53:10.686 --> 53:11.726
How are you?

53:11.726 --> 53:13.006
Good. How are you?

53:13.006 --> 53:14.406
I've been better.

53:16.486 --> 53:17.646
They buddy up to you.

53:18.886 --> 53:20.686
HENRY:
I hear you have a blog.

53:20.686 --> 53:23.006
Yeah.
What's it called?

53:23.006 --> 53:24.926
Meredithsmemories.com.

53:24.926 --> 53:26.726
I'm going to send you an e-mail
as soon as I get home.
Cool.

53:26.726 --> 53:29.406
They act interested
in everything you've got to say.

53:29.406 --> 53:30.966
HENRY:
Do you like movies?

53:30.966 --> 53:32.326
I like animation movies.

53:32.326 --> 53:33.646
I love all the Shreks.

53:33.646 --> 53:35.366
I love the Shreks too.

53:35.686 --> 53:37.966
BRENNER:
And then you let your guard
down just for one second,

53:37.966 --> 53:42.246
and that's
when they make their move.

53:42.246 --> 53:44.406
Come here.
Let me give you a hug.

53:59.286 --> 54:03.366
And it feels...it feels normal.
It feels normal at first,
like...

54:03.366 --> 54:06.246
like your secret and his.

54:17.606 --> 54:20.206
We'll be special friends.

54:20.206 --> 54:22.206
Let's not tell
anyone, OK?

54:22.206 --> 54:23.486
OK.
(WHISPERS)
OK.

54:24.806 --> 54:26.726
You better go back to your mom.

54:26.726 --> 54:28.246
She's going to be worried
about you.

54:28.246 --> 54:29.605
OK. Bye.

54:29.605 --> 54:30.885
Bye.

54:35.805 --> 54:38.405
(GROANS)

54:48.045 --> 54:50.885
But then it...
it festers in you,

54:50.885 --> 54:52.845
cos you know,
you know it's wrong.

54:56.805 --> 54:59.925
Like it's your fault, like
you've actually brought this on.

54:59.925 --> 55:03.205
You feel...you feel guilty.

55:03.205 --> 55:06.205
I mean, I could have screamed.
I could have screamed.

55:06.205 --> 55:10.005
I mean,
my mum was in the next room.

55:14.085 --> 55:16.285
(SOBS)

55:16.285 --> 55:19.765
Simon...
Simon, you...you need to talk
to somebody about this.

55:19.765 --> 55:23.045
It doesn't just go away.

55:26.165 --> 55:29.085
I need to get back to work.

55:29.085 --> 55:32.725
You... It's still affecting you.
You have to deal with it.

55:32.725 --> 55:35.605
I am dealing with it...
in my own way.

57:35.564 --> 57:37.804
We know you don't
really want to beat the system,

57:37.924 --> 57:39.363
just want it to work.

57:41.043 --> 57:44.363
We know you don't
really enjoy complaining.

57:46.483 --> 57:49.483
We too believe the most important
part of a home

57:49.603 --> 57:51.843
is the people inside.

57:51.963 --> 57:53.323
Make a stand

57:53.443 --> 57:54.923
with AXA's home insurance,

57:55.083 --> 57:57.363
and get your own
dedicated claim handler

57:57.523 --> 57:59.403
if your home
is damaged by water.

58:34.123 --> 58:35.683
My people...

58:35.763 --> 58:38.323
If our enemy wishes to bring us war,

58:38.403 --> 58:41.003
then let us give him a war.

58:41.123 --> 58:44.403
Let us strike without warning,
without mercy,

58:44.483 --> 58:46.523
in every city and every direction.

58:46.643 --> 58:49.883
Let us unleash
the whirlwind of our wrath!

58:49.963 --> 58:52.163
May our guns never tire.

58:52.283 --> 58:55.123
Let them suffer
the full force of our fury

58:55.243 --> 58:59.963
and curse the day they stepped foot
onto this, our home.

59:00.043 --> 59:01.763
Killzone 2 - their home, your hell.

59:01.843 --> 59:02.803
Only on:

01:01:00.881 --> 01:01:02.441
THUD!

01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:06.561
Sorry, I was trying
to be quiet,

01:01:06.561 --> 01:01:08.081
but there's not enough room
in here to swing a cat.

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.481
Did you just say
"swing a cat"?

01:01:10.481 --> 01:01:12.761
Where I come from,
cats sometimes get swung.

01:01:12.761 --> 01:01:14.641
But now that you're up,

01:01:14.641 --> 01:01:16.521
can I tell you
about my day?

01:01:16.521 --> 01:01:18.561
No, you can't,

01:01:18.561 --> 01:01:21.281
because I have
a little something for you.

01:01:21.281 --> 01:01:25.641
Just for being one of LA's
top and up-and-coming chefs.

01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:26.601
Aww.

01:01:30.761 --> 01:01:32.201
Oh, my God.

01:01:32.201 --> 01:01:33.841
Thank you.

01:01:33.841 --> 01:01:36.081
I have the perfect place
to put it, too.
Where?

01:01:36.081 --> 01:01:37.841
My office.
The kitchen?

01:01:37.841 --> 01:01:41.441
I mean my office.
I've been promoted to head chef.

01:01:41.441 --> 01:01:43.441
(gasps)
On probation, of course.

01:01:43.441 --> 01:01:46.601
I still have a lot to prove.
But, Kevin, head chef.
