WEBVTT

00:01.771 --> 00:03.955
Kids, I bought the
house we live in now way back

00:03.956 --> 00:05.823
before I ever met your mother.

00:05.824 --> 00:08.659
It needed a lot of work,
but I had a vision for it.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.327
Vintage rolltop desk here.

00:10.328 --> 00:11.912
I haven't decided
whether to put the fern

00:11.913 --> 00:13.314
on the right or the left side,

00:13.315 --> 00:15.416
but you know, sometimes
you just gotta wing it. Right?

00:15.417 --> 00:16.584
Left side.

00:16.585 --> 00:17.751
Oh, and right outside,

00:17.752 --> 00:20.004
I want to put up a
basketball hoop for the kids.

00:20.005 --> 00:21.422
- Huh?
- Ted.

00:21.423 --> 00:23.591
This is your seduction lounge.

00:23.592 --> 00:25.426
Sex swing there,

00:25.427 --> 00:27.328
vibrating Jell-O pit
right there,

00:27.329 --> 00:29.697
rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel
right here.

00:30.332 --> 00:31.799
Don't ask; you're not ready.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.535
And that basketball hoop?

00:34.536 --> 00:37.104
Outdoor stripper pole.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.340
We'll just tell the ladies
to be careful in the winter.

00:39.341 --> 00:42.476
You think a tongue stuck
to a frozen pole is bad...

00:42.477 --> 00:46.614
Hey. Barney, let's go
outside for a second.

00:46.615 --> 00:48.365
We have a confession.

00:48.366 --> 00:51.218
This wasn't really about
seeing Ted's house.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.220
It's an intervention.

00:53.221 --> 00:54.488
Oh, thank God.

00:54.489 --> 00:55.856
I'll go first.

00:55.857 --> 00:57.825
Ted, this house you bought
for your hypothetical family

00:57.826 --> 00:59.059
is super weird.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.061
We talk about it all the time
behind your back.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.847
Yeah. This intervention
isn't for me.

01:02.848 --> 01:04.197
It's for you.

01:04.199 --> 01:06.400
Why did Barney
need an intervention?

01:06.401 --> 01:08.435
It all started
a few nights earlier.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.770
Barney, I can't believe

01:09.771 --> 01:11.889
your giant TV is broken.
It's March Madness.

01:11.890 --> 01:13.974
Okay, uh, I think I see
what the problem is.

01:13.975 --> 01:15.476
Barney, can you grab me
a screwdriver?

01:15.477 --> 01:16.744
Sure thing.

01:16.745 --> 01:18.646
Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H.

01:18.647 --> 01:20.881
I got a hundred bucks if you can
be here in five. Thanks.

01:20.882 --> 01:23.317
You call the super
for a screwdriver?

01:23.318 --> 01:25.553
Yeah... here's the thing
about me and tools...

01:25.554 --> 01:28.322
the only one I know how to use
is attached to me,

01:28.323 --> 01:30.925
and I am not going to try
putting it in the TV.

01:30.926 --> 01:32.293
Again.

01:32.294 --> 01:34.245
Okay, that's ridiculous.

01:34.246 --> 01:36.196
Everyone should know
how to use tools.

01:37.415 --> 01:40.501
Well, here's our
screwdriver now.

01:45.040 --> 01:47.808
Guys, I'm
pretty sure that's not Luis,

01:47.809 --> 01:49.143
but I can't be certain.

01:49.144 --> 01:50.477
Someone introduce yourself.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.548
Barney, I...

01:54.549 --> 01:57.117
I got your letter.

02:00.155 --> 02:02.323
Dad?

02:02.400 --> 02:06.324

02:17.902 --> 02:19.569
I can't believe Barney
is talking to his dad right now.

02:19.570 --> 02:20.770
Yeah, what do you say

02:20.771 --> 02:22.172
after three decades
of not seeing each other?

02:22.173 --> 02:24.024
"So, how 'bout those

02:24.025 --> 02:25.959
last 30 Super Bowls"?

02:25.960 --> 02:27.093
Okay, now I feel bad

02:27.094 --> 02:29.129
about making fun of him
for the tool thing.

02:29.130 --> 02:31.464
My dad was the one
who taught me all that stuff.

02:31.465 --> 02:34.234
Well, to be fair, everyone has
some glaring gap in knowledge,

02:34.235 --> 02:36.336
something really obvious
you somehow never learned.

02:36.337 --> 02:38.138
Okay, but a screwdriver?

02:38.139 --> 02:40.073
Come on, I don't have any gaps
that fundamental.

02:40.074 --> 02:43.210
Really? I seem to recall...

02:43.211 --> 02:45.095
Daniel Burnham was an architect

02:45.096 --> 02:47.080
whose ever-shifting style
and aesthetic

02:47.081 --> 02:49.749
made him a true architectural
chamma-leeon.

02:51.252 --> 02:52.619
And only the most
gifted chamma-leeon

02:52.620 --> 02:55.222
could've designed
classic beaux arts masterpieces

02:55.223 --> 02:58.825
right alongside
sleek modern flatirons.

02:58.826 --> 03:00.594
His name might as well have been

03:00.595 --> 03:03.813
Daniel Chamma-leeon.

03:03.814 --> 03:05.482
Um, Professor?

03:05.483 --> 03:08.602
Uh, do you mean "chameleon"?

03:10.304 --> 03:15.175
Betty, I'm pretty sure it's
pronounced "chamma-leeon," so...

03:17.411 --> 03:19.663
Class dismissed.

03:19.664 --> 03:21.481
No homework. For a while.

03:21.482 --> 03:24.117
Okay, I learned that word
by reading it.

03:24.118 --> 03:26.286
That's how I've always
pronounced it.

03:26.287 --> 03:27.520
Oh, Ted, that wasn't easy.

03:27.521 --> 03:29.623
It took a lot of "ch-aracter"
to admit that.

03:29.624 --> 03:31.625
Okay, Scherbatsky.
You want to tussle?

03:31.626 --> 03:32.959
- I'll tussle.
- You want to tussle?

03:32.960 --> 03:34.794
- Let's tussle.
- Marine biologist.

03:34.795 --> 03:36.463
Please, no.

03:36.464 --> 03:38.164
So this really sucks, but

03:38.165 --> 03:40.600
I'm going to be in the North Pole
for the next three months.

03:40.601 --> 03:42.135
Seriously?

03:42.136 --> 03:43.370
The North Pole?

03:43.371 --> 03:45.188
Okay, pal, if you want
to break up with me,

03:45.189 --> 03:47.807
just tell it to me straight.
Don't pretend you're going

03:47.808 --> 03:49.576
someplace we all know
doesn't exist.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.778
Um, I'm going to be studying
the mating habits of...

03:51.779 --> 03:54.547
Of who? Santa's elves?
Rudolph?

03:54.548 --> 03:56.416
You know what?
I'm going on a trip, too, Scott.

03:56.417 --> 03:58.151
It, uh, starts in Narnia.

03:58.152 --> 03:59.886
It works its way up
to Candyland,

03:59.887 --> 04:02.122
and then, hey, congratulate me,

04:02.123 --> 04:04.224
because I'm the new Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher

04:04.225 --> 04:07.093
at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus!

04:07.094 --> 04:09.696
Robin, the North Pole
is a real place.

04:09.697 --> 04:11.231
You know that, right?

04:13.167 --> 04:15.969
So... you want
to get pizza later? Or...

04:15.970 --> 04:17.771
I think we should break up.

04:17.772 --> 04:19.738
I still think about him
in the shower.

04:21.341 --> 04:23.643
- Hey. - Tell us everything.
How'd it go, bud?

04:23.644 --> 04:25.912
Where do I begin?

04:27.515 --> 04:29.482
- So, I'm not sure how to start this.
- Yeah.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.352
I think I need a drink.

04:32.653 --> 04:33.719
Me, too.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.987
Glen McKenna, neat.

04:35.089 --> 04:37.123
Nice order. Up top.

04:40.161 --> 04:43.363
Look, it's been 30 years.

04:43.364 --> 04:45.598
And now you just
show up out of nowhere?

04:45.599 --> 04:48.668
This is... this is going
to take me a minute.

04:48.669 --> 04:50.870
Yeah. I understand.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.241
By the way, hell of a tie.
Is that Italian silk?

04:55.242 --> 04:57.644
I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad
we're best friends now.

05:00.314 --> 05:01.765
- Make a muscle.
- There you go.

05:01.766 --> 05:02.882
Ah!

05:02.883 --> 05:05.085
Guys, my dad's awesome.

05:05.086 --> 05:06.820
He's the mother of all fathers.

05:06.821 --> 05:08.088
Check this out.

05:08.089 --> 05:10.023
Hey, back when I was a kid,
you used to be a roadie.

05:10.024 --> 05:13.093
- Do you still do that?
- Not anymore.

05:13.094 --> 05:16.396
Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for
The Stones through West Germany,

05:16.397 --> 05:18.565
and their tour manager
loses his arms,

05:18.566 --> 05:20.734
bus-surfing through a tunnel.

05:20.735 --> 05:21.868
Gnarly.

05:21.869 --> 05:24.070
Long story short,

05:24.071 --> 05:27.007
I've been managing tours
ever since,

05:27.008 --> 05:30.677
and that dude high-fives people
with his face now.

05:30.678 --> 05:33.663
You're funny.

05:33.664 --> 05:35.348
My dad's funny.

05:36.249 --> 05:38.417
So, all these years,
there's this one question

05:38.418 --> 05:40.036
I've been dying to ask him.

05:40.037 --> 05:42.455
- Why did you abandon me?
- Why'd you wait so long to contact me?

05:42.456 --> 05:45.058
You've hurt me before,
why should I trust you now?

05:46.159 --> 05:47.293
Do you...

05:47.494 --> 05:49.195
get laid a lot?

05:50.396 --> 05:51.664
Big-time.

05:54.733 --> 05:56.135
Observe.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:14.822 --> 06:18.174
Oh, my God,
that took you five seconds.

06:18.175 --> 06:19.676
Oh, was it that long?

06:19.677 --> 06:22.429
Life's too short
for chatty chicks.

06:24.730 --> 06:26.232
You're a master.

06:26.333 --> 06:28.735
You are legen... wait for it...

06:28.836 --> 06:30.370
...daddy!

06:30.371 --> 06:31.538
Legendaddy!

06:31.539 --> 06:33.006
The man is a god.

06:33.007 --> 06:36.376
And he's still out there,
living the dream.

06:36.377 --> 06:38.244
So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow
with Bon Jovi.

06:38.245 --> 06:40.413
I'll be on the road
the rest of the year.

06:40.414 --> 06:42.282
Oh, that's cool.

06:42.283 --> 06:46.553
Say, you want to join me
for the tour's Asian leg?

06:46.554 --> 06:49.422
This is going to be
the second-most fun

06:49.423 --> 06:50.957
I've ever had on an Asian leg.

06:52.827 --> 06:55.095
Barney, we... we know
you're psyched,

06:55.096 --> 06:57.063
but just...
be careful.

06:57.064 --> 06:58.231
What do you mean?

06:58.232 --> 07:00.300
Well, this guy has flaked
out on your whole life.

07:00.301 --> 07:01.668
It sounds like he just might be

07:01.669 --> 07:03.002
telling you what
you want to hear.

07:03.003 --> 07:05.438
Barney, we just don't
want to see you get hurt.

07:05.439 --> 07:09.943
First of all, Robin,
my dad could beat up your dad.

07:09.944 --> 07:11.111
Second,

07:11.112 --> 07:12.612
you don't have to worry.

07:12.613 --> 07:14.914
He's cool.
Now if you'll excuse me...

07:14.915 --> 07:17.734
I have to go renew my passport,

07:17.735 --> 07:20.253
and get a travel-sized rotating
Vietnamese Shame Wheel.

07:21.188 --> 07:23.189
Don't ask; you're not ready.

07:24.525 --> 07:26.092
I hope Barney's dad isn't just

07:26.093 --> 07:28.328
pretending to be something
he's not, you know?

07:28.329 --> 07:32.398
Yeah. That would make Jerry
a real chamma-leeon.

07:34.101 --> 07:35.602
You have gaps, too, Lily.

07:35.603 --> 07:37.437
You got nothing on me.

07:38.272 --> 07:39.756
Hey, Lily, can you
toss me a beer?

07:39.757 --> 07:41.541
Sure, honey.

07:44.245 --> 07:46.379
You have terrible aim.

07:46.380 --> 07:47.947
That's not true.

07:47.948 --> 07:49.749
Lily, at our apartment,

07:49.750 --> 07:53.153
you're the one who
pees on the floor.

07:53.988 --> 07:55.455
Oh, my God. Barney's dad.

07:55.456 --> 07:58.158
Hey, uh, you're
Barney's friends, right?

07:58.159 --> 08:00.410
Yeah, but... aren't you
supposed to be off

08:00.411 --> 08:02.629
managing some tour
in Australia?

08:02.630 --> 08:04.097
What?

08:04.098 --> 08:06.699
No, I... I'm a driving instructor
up in White Plains.

08:07.801 --> 08:11.062
And I need your help...
Barney won't return my calls.

08:16.313 --> 08:18.447
What do you mean, Barney
won't return your calls?

08:18.448 --> 08:20.382
He said you two had
an amazing night together.

08:20.383 --> 08:22.251
That's not what happened.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.086
I'm not sure how to start this.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.420
Yeah.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.306
I think I need a drink.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.390
Me, too.

08:28.391 --> 08:29.508
Glen McKenna, neat.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.193
Milk, skim.

08:31.194 --> 08:33.195
Milk?

08:33.196 --> 08:35.898
Oh, you're taking it easy.
Crazy night?

08:35.899 --> 08:37.265
I'll say.

08:37.267 --> 08:40.202
Between you and me,
I had a lot of acid last night.

08:40.203 --> 08:41.570
Wow.

08:41.571 --> 08:43.371
I think it was the chili dog.

08:43.907 --> 08:46.041
I had to take four Tums.

08:46.042 --> 08:49.044
I was up till, like, 9:30.

08:49.879 --> 08:51.313
Hey, um...

08:51.314 --> 08:53.615
When I was a kid,
you used to be a roadie.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.917
You still do that?

08:54.918 --> 08:57.819
No. I switched lanes years ago.

09:00.490 --> 09:03.559
I should explain.
I'm a driving instructor.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.427
Now you get it, right?

09:06.663 --> 09:08.263
Yeah, no, I get it.

09:08.264 --> 09:10.265
Um, but when I was a kid,

09:10.266 --> 09:12.467
you... you were
this total badass.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.369
Oh, I know.

09:14.370 --> 09:16.004
I was a real hard partier.

09:16.005 --> 09:18.073
Yeah, okay, now we're getting
to the good stuff.

09:18.074 --> 09:20.609
The drugs, the alcohol,
the women...

09:20.610 --> 09:22.344
Yes, yes, yes.

09:22.345 --> 09:23.278
I was out of control.

09:23.279 --> 09:24.947
♪ Out of control. ♪

09:24.948 --> 09:27.416
So when your mom said
I couldn't see you any more,

09:27.417 --> 09:30.118
it was rock bottom for me.

09:31.921 --> 09:34.022
I'm so sorry.

09:34.857 --> 09:37.159
You ever bang Stevie Nicks?

09:38.294 --> 09:40.329
Barney wasn't interested
in my apology.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.964
He just wanted me to be cool.

09:41.965 --> 09:45.901
And I was so desperate
to connect with him,

09:45.902 --> 09:47.769
I did something
I'm not proud of.

09:47.770 --> 09:49.404
I started bragging.

09:49.405 --> 09:51.907
I bet you didn't know
this about me, Barney,

09:51.908 --> 09:54.476
but I've published
two nonfiction books

09:54.477 --> 09:56.545
about asparagus.

09:56.546 --> 09:58.347
And one fiction.

09:59.983 --> 10:03.619
I'm credited with inventing
the word "furgling."

10:04.287 --> 10:06.288
It means fumbling for keys.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.325
So then all the county fair
judges started chanting,

10:10.326 --> 10:13.328
"More quiche! More quiche!"

10:14.998 --> 10:19.835
I guess you could call me
the LeBron James of drapes.

10:21.237 --> 10:24.473
I could tell he just wanted me
to be this big ladies' man,

10:24.474 --> 10:26.708
so...

10:28.211 --> 10:30.512
What a hottie, huh?

10:30.513 --> 10:32.581
I'm sure you're a real player.

10:32.582 --> 10:35.467
Big-time.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.636
Observe.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.798
Excuse me, that's my son
over there.

10:50.767 --> 10:52.868
I'm trying to reconnect
with him after 30 years.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.904
Would you just write down
any seven numbers here,

10:55.905 --> 10:57.506
so that I can impress him?

10:57.507 --> 10:59.408
Please, I'm desperate.

11:03.312 --> 11:06.114
Oh, my God, you're a natural.

11:06.115 --> 11:08.717
Think of the pickup plays
we can run as a father-son duo.

11:08.718 --> 11:10.385
There's the
"Father Knows Breast,"

11:10.386 --> 11:11.386
there's the

11:11.387 --> 11:12.804
"Bush Dynasty,"

11:12.805 --> 11:14.589
the "Lick Father, Lick Son."

11:14.590 --> 11:15.590
Oh, no, no.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.059
I couldn't do that.

11:17.060 --> 11:17.843
Why?

11:17.844 --> 11:19.094
I have a family now.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.462
That's my wife

11:20.463 --> 11:23.899
Cheryl, my daughter Carly...
she's in college.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.534
This is my son J.J.

11:25.535 --> 11:26.985
I was hoping you could come over

11:26.986 --> 11:28.403
to dinner sometime
and meet them.

11:28.404 --> 11:30.238
You're all wearing
matching sweaters.

11:30.239 --> 11:31.440
That's cute.

11:32.241 --> 11:35.310
Look, I got
to get going, Jerry.

11:35.311 --> 11:36.845
But, uh, this was great.

11:36.846 --> 11:38.280
Glad we did this.

11:41.417 --> 11:45.120
I made him wait
all these years for me and...

11:45.121 --> 11:47.889
I'm just not the guy
he wanted me to be.

11:48.725 --> 11:50.959
I know I don't
deserve it, but...

11:50.960 --> 11:53.562
I need another chance
to connect with my son.

11:55.698 --> 11:58.100
We think you should
give him another chance.

11:58.101 --> 12:00.268
That's the real reason
we're out here.

12:00.269 --> 12:02.237
He lives ten minutes away.

12:02.238 --> 12:03.739
What?

12:03.740 --> 12:05.440
You're having dinner
with him tonight.

12:05.441 --> 12:07.642
No, I most certainly am not.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.778
Look, I met him.

12:09.779 --> 12:11.346
He's not my kind of bro
and that's that.

12:11.347 --> 12:12.514
Are you sure it's
not more than that?

12:12.515 --> 12:13.982
Guys, get it through your heads.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.452
I am never gonna
talk to my dad again.

12:17.453 --> 12:19.454
No, Barney.

12:19.455 --> 12:21.923
I'm never gonna talk
to my dad again.

12:22.859 --> 12:24.659
But your dad is alive

12:24.660 --> 12:27.362
and he lives just down the road.

12:31.134 --> 12:32.167
Fine, I'll go.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.168
Awesome.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.336
Um, Lily, keys.

12:39.609 --> 12:42.681
I'm literally
11 inches from you.

12:46.965 --> 12:49.900
And so Barney agreed
to give his dad one more chance.

12:49.910 --> 12:52.212
Hello. You must be Barney.

12:52.213 --> 12:53.263
I'm Cheryl.

12:53.264 --> 12:55.432
It's just so nice
to finally meet you.

12:55.433 --> 12:57.434
I love that suit.

12:57.435 --> 12:58.752
Oh, thank you very much.

12:58.753 --> 13:01.154
And I love your...

13:03.858 --> 13:05.292
...coat.

13:05.293 --> 13:06.660
I love your coat.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.562
Oh, that's your coat, Barney.

13:08.563 --> 13:10.564
I just took it from you.

13:10.565 --> 13:12.332
Well, I do love it.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.335
It's doing a nice job
covering up that chair.

13:17.071 --> 13:19.339
Guess now we wait.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.541
Hey, I got an idea
how to pass the time.

13:21.542 --> 13:22.792
A little trivia game.

13:22.793 --> 13:26.313
Robin, reindeer: real or fake?

13:27.315 --> 13:28.281
Okay, I'm not an idiot.

13:28.282 --> 13:31.952
Reindeer are obviously
f... re... fake?

13:31.953 --> 13:33.086
Yikes!

13:33.087 --> 13:35.021
I'm surrounded
by a bunch of dum-dums.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.892
Good thing I don't have any gaps
in my knowledge.

13:41.729 --> 13:44.431
I am perfect.

13:44.432 --> 13:47.067
Oh, for the love of God, guys,
enough already.

13:47.068 --> 13:48.368
What, baby?

13:48.369 --> 13:49.836
You've been treating me
with kid gloves

13:49.837 --> 13:51.371
ever since my dad died.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.439
That's not true.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.807
Robin, don't disagree
with Marshall.

13:53.808 --> 13:54.808
I'm sorry.

13:54.809 --> 13:57.077
I first noticed it at the bar.

13:57.078 --> 13:58.044
Hey, Lily,

13:58.045 --> 13:59.646
Can you get me a mojito?

13:59.647 --> 14:01.715
Normally, you would've
given me crap

14:01.716 --> 14:04.417
for an hour about a voice crack
that pubescently girl-like,

14:04.418 --> 14:05.518
but nothing.

14:05.519 --> 14:07.954
So then I started
to test you guys.

14:07.955 --> 14:10.824
The Phantom Menace is by far
the best Star Wars movie.

14:13.294 --> 14:16.596
It ages well, that's the thing.

14:16.597 --> 14:19.466
You guys like my new soul patch?

14:19.467 --> 14:22.335
Righteous hair tab, brotha.

14:22.336 --> 14:23.937
And once I figured it out,

14:23.938 --> 14:27.807
I started doing crazy stuff
to see how far you'd let me go.

14:27.808 --> 14:29.776
Hey, guys.

14:30.211 --> 14:31.444
This is Rex.

14:31.445 --> 14:34.381
He's a possum.

14:34.382 --> 14:36.716
I found him in the trash.

14:36.717 --> 14:38.284
He lives with us now.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.287
I love him.

14:41.288 --> 14:45.191
Lily, we are living
with a possum.

14:45.192 --> 14:47.927
Rex is violent and he hates us.

14:47.928 --> 14:50.397
But, baby,
you just lost your dad.

14:50.398 --> 14:51.698
None of us wants to upset you.

14:51.699 --> 14:52.699
Please.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.800
If you guys really want me

14:53.801 --> 14:55.568
to get over the worst tragedy
of my life,

14:55.569 --> 14:57.804
I'm begging you,
tear me a new one.

14:57.805 --> 15:00.707
But not like Rex tried to
in my sleep last night.

15:02.093 --> 15:04.177
J.J., dinner.

15:04.178 --> 15:06.146
When I got your letter,
I dug this up.

15:06.147 --> 15:08.248
You were probably
too young to remember,

15:08.249 --> 15:12.352
but this is you, this is me,
and, of course, ZZ Top.

15:12.353 --> 15:14.654
I do remember that.

15:14.655 --> 15:16.623
I climbed up on that
dude's lap and told him

15:16.624 --> 15:18.058
what I wanted for Christmas.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.362
Yeah, I used to love
taking you backstage.

15:22.363 --> 15:24.964
You were the coolest
little kid.

15:26.867 --> 15:29.202
Hi, Barney.
It's great to finally meet you.

15:29.203 --> 15:32.138
J.J., I'm talking
to Dad right now. God.

15:33.340 --> 15:34.407
Seriously,

15:34.408 --> 15:35.458
it's time.

15:35.459 --> 15:36.876
What are my gaps?

15:37.812 --> 15:41.414
Well, I guess maybe
one gap you have is...

15:41.415 --> 15:42.982
you can't wink.

15:42.983 --> 15:46.152
Don't you think that
maybe we should go home

15:46.153 --> 15:49.389
and, uh, "do the laundry"?

15:52.927 --> 15:55.228
You can't swallow pills.

15:57.631 --> 16:00.567
Ooh, ooh, I got one.

16:00.568 --> 16:04.037
You think John Kennedy and Jack
Kennedy are the same person.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.506
Right?

16:07.274 --> 16:09.042
What?

16:09.043 --> 16:10.310
So, Barney, I understand

16:10.311 --> 16:12.245
you have a pretty big job
with a bank.

16:12.246 --> 16:13.179
Yeah, I do.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.215
I make a ton of money.

16:15.216 --> 16:17.083
How much do you make, J.J.?

16:17.084 --> 16:19.385
I'm 11.

16:19.386 --> 16:23.022
Oh, well, huh, now we all know
you make excuses.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.058
I was talking about money.

16:25.059 --> 16:26.760
Actually, J.J. has a job.

16:26.761 --> 16:27.761
Tell him, J.J.

16:27.762 --> 16:29.129
I got a paper route.

16:30.064 --> 16:32.165
Good time to get into
print media.

16:32.166 --> 16:33.233
Am I right, Dad?

16:33.234 --> 16:34.400
Good slam, Barney.

16:34.401 --> 16:35.535
Jerry.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.036
It's all good fun.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.773
Just ribbing among
long lost brothers.

16:39.774 --> 16:42.609
J.J.'s a heck of
a basketball player.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.779
Uh, you don't strike me
as the athletic type, Jayj.

16:45.780 --> 16:48.748
Dad, check it.

16:54.371 --> 16:57.223
Triceps.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.058
What gym do you go to?

16:59.059 --> 17:00.660
Fourth period?

17:00.661 --> 17:02.896
Sounds like you're having
your fourth period.

17:02.897 --> 17:03.897
Am I right, Dad?!

17:03.898 --> 17:04.881
Got him again.

17:04.882 --> 17:05.898
Jerry!

17:05.900 --> 17:07.016
Oh, okay, Barney.

17:07.017 --> 17:08.434
Uh, maybe that's enough.

17:08.435 --> 17:09.719
Why? J.J. started it.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.570
What does J.J.
even stand for anyway?

17:11.571 --> 17:14.907
J... Jerky... Jerkface?

17:15.675 --> 17:17.510
J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.

17:17.511 --> 17:20.146
Jerome Jr...?

17:21.915 --> 17:24.917
Oh.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.820
He's... he's named after you.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.740
Excuse me.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.796
I like having a brother.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.966
You always add too
much water to oatmeal.

17:39.967 --> 17:41.367
Yes, I drown the son of a bitch.

17:41.368 --> 17:43.670
You consistently miss
at least one belt loop.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.038
It's like I'm blind.

17:45.039 --> 17:47.173
You're too old to ask
to see the cockpit.

17:47.174 --> 17:49.342
Whoa. Whoa.

17:49.343 --> 17:51.444
Guys, my dad just died.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.213
Aw, honey.

17:53.214 --> 17:54.514
No, I'm just kidding.

17:54.515 --> 17:55.615
This is great.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.350
I really, I really missed this.

18:01.255 --> 18:02.522
Barney, what is going on?

18:02.523 --> 18:03.489
This is mine.

18:03.490 --> 18:04.624
I don't understand.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.893
J.J. gets a childhood, a dad,

18:06.894 --> 18:09.295
a real family
and a basketball hoop?

18:09.296 --> 18:10.997
No, no. I at least get the hoop.

18:10.998 --> 18:12.098
I'm taking it with me.

18:12.099 --> 18:13.633
Please, just come down
and talk to me.

18:13.634 --> 18:14.734
Why? Why should I?

18:14.735 --> 18:15.935
You're lame, okay?

18:15.936 --> 18:18.972
You're just some lame
suburban dad.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.306
Why does that make you so mad?

18:20.307 --> 18:22.609
Because if you were gonna be
some lame suburban dad,

18:22.610 --> 18:24.978
why couldn't you have
been that for me?!

18:25.813 --> 18:29.849
Look, Barney,
I know I screwed up...

18:29.850 --> 18:32.619
Oh, "screwed up" doesn't even
begin to describe...

18:32.620 --> 18:34.854
I know, I know, I know!

18:35.489 --> 18:36.489
I want to fix this,

18:36.490 --> 18:37.490
and I don't know how!

18:37.491 --> 18:38.725
Please, tell me what I can do!

18:38.726 --> 18:39.926
I'll do anything!

18:56.276 --> 18:58.411
You're never gonna
get it down like that.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.056
Barney. Barney!

19:10.057 --> 19:14.327
Just put the pointy end
into the grooves.

19:16.931 --> 19:18.798
That's it. Now turn it.

19:18.799 --> 19:20.500
Righty tighty,

19:20.501 --> 19:21.734
lefty loosey.

19:27.341 --> 19:29.742
I have no good excuse, Barney.

19:29.743 --> 19:31.344
It took me years

19:31.345 --> 19:33.880
before I was even able
to look myself in the mirror

19:33.881 --> 19:35.665
for the way I let you down.

19:36.917 --> 19:39.419
It took courage
to send me that letter.

19:40.621 --> 19:43.222
More courage than I've ever had.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.924
I owe you a lifetime

19:44.925 --> 19:47.527
of apologies, and I...

19:47.528 --> 19:51.431
I just have no idea
where to begin.

19:57.438 --> 19:59.138
Can you help me with this?

20:03.644 --> 20:05.845
Here, got it.

20:10.484 --> 20:12.986
Look, if you...

20:12.987 --> 20:16.122
ever feel like you're ready,

20:16.123 --> 20:19.392
I'd love nothing more than
to be a part of your life.

20:24.999 --> 20:26.466
Bye.

20:36.010 --> 20:38.511
Are you sure you don't
want to talk about it?

20:38.512 --> 20:39.912
I'm fine.

20:41.732 --> 20:43.149
Hey, Ted.

20:43.150 --> 20:44.150
Yeah, buddy?

20:44.151 --> 20:45.418
You, uh, still want

20:45.419 --> 20:46.886
a basketball hoop out there?
