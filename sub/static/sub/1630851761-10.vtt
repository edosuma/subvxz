LARRY: Oh, they're
from the museum.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.523
-Those are the ones?
-Yeah.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.607
You're still wearing them?

24:02.691 --> 24:03.775
You know,
they're very comfortable.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.652
They really knew
how to make a shoe back then.

24:05.735 --> 24:06.862
Yeah. Well, they had cobblers.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.489
-Cobblers, of course.
-Cobblers. We need cobblers.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.908
IRMA: Hey, you want something?
You want a little--

24:11.992 --> 24:13.326
You want somethi--
You want one of these?

24:13.410 --> 24:14.995
-No, thanks.
-I don't blame you, it's dry.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.997
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, I don't drink.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.290
-You don't drink?
-I'm in recovery.

24:18.373 --> 24:19.666
-Oh.
-IRMA: I mean, as Larry knows,

24:19.749 --> 24:22.043
-I have
a terrible relationship...
-Yeah, here we go.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.211
-...with alcohol.
-Here we go.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.588
IRMA: I was a horrible person.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.423
I was blacking out
in council meetings.

24:26.506 --> 24:27.841
And then my personal low,

24:27.924 --> 24:30.552
I woke up, I was 50 miles
outside of Bakersfield,

24:30.635 --> 24:33.054
with no pants on
and a casino chip in my hand.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.015
And I had no idea
how I got there.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.975
That's when I realized
I had to get help,

24:37.058 --> 24:39.269
so I'm in the program,
which is just fantastic.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.730
And I had to acknowledge
that there's a higher power.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.190
You have to give yourself over.

-about the Mormon advantage--
-Why would you do something--

26:20.203 --> 26:21.621
You know, we've lost her vote.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.498
What? She said she's
not gonna vote for the repeal?

a donation like this.

to have a repeal,

27:14.382 --> 27:15.717

what a disgrace it is.

were involved,

27:21.222 --> 27:25.352
-some very bad hombres.
-Really? I-- I had no idea.

What about

27:27.645 --> 27:29.147
I heard she's voting against it.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.982
Yovanovitch, she's no angel.

some things, believe me.

about Weinblatt's son.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.618
His father got him a job
at that construction company.

27:41.701 --> 27:43.787
-You know what they make?
-N-- no.

27:43.870 --> 27:44.788
Fences!

-Fences, really?
-LARRY: Yeah, fences.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.708
It's a disgrace,
and people are saying

27:48.792 --> 27:51.086
-it needs to get looked into.
-I didn't know any of this

27:51.169 --> 27:52.379
was going on behind the scenes.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.714
Oh, yeah. That's why your vote
is so important to me.

27:54.798 --> 27:58.259
Well, I mean, I did initially
feel this way anyway.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.261
Yeah, the donation
that I was telling you about,

28:00.345 --> 28:02.472
we could transfer that tonight.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.015
So do we have a deal?

28:06.393 --> 28:07.519
You can count on me.

28:07.602 --> 28:09.813

This is great.

-Hmm... not in this house.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.972

was completely improper.

-Let me ask you a question.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.776
was in World War II.
He gave them to me.

than that, Larry.

to transcribe that call.

29:05.743 --> 29:08.079

of Santa Monica City Council.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.873
Why-- why would you do that?

29:09.956 --> 29:12.083
It's the right thing to do
to report it. It's my duty.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.627

enough with your duty!

29:14.711 --> 29:16.629

-It's my chair.

29:21.759 --> 29:23.470
-And you bribe councilwomen.
-Eh.

29:23.553 --> 29:24.846
And I'm sure
Head Councilman Weinblatt

29:24.929 --> 29:26.848
will be very interested
in hearing about all this.

it wasn't half as bad

you had the passport?

I have to be at the airport
three hours early

international flights and shit.

few hours left, man.

Hey, city council's
voting tonight to repeal.

-It's tonight already?
-LARRY: It's tonight. Yeah.

LEON: Where the fuck's
the passport?

31:07.574 --> 31:10.243
Even if they vote to repeal it,
it's all gonna be meaningless

31:10.326 --> 31:12.870
if Weinblatt reads
that Vindman transcript.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.455
Are you sure Weinblatt
hasn't read it already?

31:14.539 --> 31:16.332
LARRY: No, 'cause it
couldn't have come until today,

31:16.416 --> 31:18.793
and Irma told me that he's been
at the council all day.

31:18.876 --> 31:21.087
-So what are you gonna do?
-LEON: Are those in there?

31:21.170 --> 31:23.298
LARRY: I know he lives
with his mother. And I'm gonna

31:23.381 --> 31:25.425
-talk my way in and...
-Damn it!

31:25.508 --> 31:26.634
...hopefully find
the transcript.
