02:06.385 --> 02:09.319
You have
one new voice message.

02:09.321 --> 02:11.088
First voice message.

02:11.090 --> 02:13.115
Hey, Mitchell,
it's your dad.

02:13.117 --> 02:14.157
I got the check you sent me,

02:14.159 --> 02:15.860
but the son of a bitch bounced.

02:15.862 --> 02:18.430
And you still owe me for
the trannie in the F-150.

02:19.666 --> 02:20.998
I don't know what's
going on with your

02:21.000 --> 02:23.067
little beer company or
whatever you call it.

02:23.069 --> 02:25.402
But when you're ready to come
back to work, let me know.

02:25.404 --> 02:26.837
I could use the help.

02:26.839 --> 02:29.573
I'm working on the Sloane
House on Separate Road.

02:29.575 --> 02:30.509
So give me a call.

02:31.510 --> 02:33.110
Bye.

03:00.106 --> 03:01.304
When we get to the reception,

03:01.306 --> 03:03.076
we should take turns
manning the keg.

03:05.578 --> 03:06.579
Why?

03:08.280 --> 03:09.649
So people know it's our beer.

03:11.718 --> 03:13.751
I'm not gonna do that.

03:13.753 --> 03:15.218
Why not?

03:15.220 --> 03:17.955
Because I'm trying to have
a good time, not serve drinks.

03:17.957 --> 03:19.657
You're still gonna
have a good time,

03:19.659 --> 03:21.792
but it would be smart to
represent the brand a little bit.

03:21.794 --> 03:23.060
I'll represent the brand.

03:23.062 --> 03:25.098
I'm just not gonna
pump the keg all night.

03:26.298 --> 03:27.133
Forget it.

03:29.802 --> 03:31.503
I'd kill for a beer right now.

03:34.774 --> 03:36.239
Hey.

03:36.241 --> 03:40.410
Meredith and Brooks, they
are indeed husband and wife.

03:40.412 --> 03:41.914
And you may kiss your wife.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.501
It's a Belgian ale
that's a little bit sweet,

04:04.503 --> 04:05.538
with a hint of spice.

04:06.505 --> 04:07.772
Here, try it.

04:13.278 --> 04:14.046
Not bad.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.649
Have people been
trying the keg?

04:18.151 --> 04:18.951
Not really.

04:20.119 --> 04:21.685
All right, well if
you could let them know

04:21.687 --> 04:23.520
it's a local microbrew,
I'd really appreciate it.

04:23.522 --> 04:24.322
I'll tell them.

04:25.825 --> 04:26.857
Cheers.

04:26.859 --> 04:27.858
Cheers.

04:34.667 --> 04:35.800
Hi, guys.

04:35.802 --> 04:36.901
Hi, there.

04:36.903 --> 04:38.468
Could I interest you
in a local microbrew?

04:38.470 --> 04:39.837
I'm sorry, no thanks.

04:39.839 --> 04:40.640
Appreciate it.

04:41.707 --> 04:43.641
Guess who's here.

04:43.643 --> 04:45.142
- Who?
- Grace.

04:45.144 --> 04:47.377
And, Meredith
says she's single.

04:47.379 --> 04:48.879
So?

04:48.881 --> 04:50.147
What do you mean so?

04:50.149 --> 04:51.381
She's the one that
got away, man.

04:51.383 --> 04:52.583
Is she?

04:52.585 --> 04:53.483
Yes.

04:53.485 --> 04:54.921
She had a crush on
me in high school.

04:56.488 --> 04:58.758
I'm gonna need you to
be my wingman tonight.

05:00.893 --> 05:02.760
This is so embarrassing.

05:02.762 --> 05:04.494
What is?

05:04.496 --> 05:05.830
We brought our
beer to a wedding,

05:05.832 --> 05:07.266
and we're the only
ones drinking it.

05:08.734 --> 05:10.435
It's more of a cocktail crowd.

05:12.205 --> 05:13.005
I wanna leave.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.707
You just gotta relax.
Let's just have a good time.

05:16.709 --> 05:17.743
Not possible.

05:18.911 --> 05:20.410
Why not?

05:20.412 --> 05:23.413
Because this was supposed
to be our big reveal.

05:23.415 --> 05:25.883
Just don't think
about that right now.

05:25.885 --> 05:27.284
What you need to think
about is which one

05:27.286 --> 05:29.887
of these city girls you're
gonna take home tonight.

05:29.889 --> 05:31.755
City girls aren't
interested in a carpenter

05:31.757 --> 05:32.859
who lives in Bangall.

05:33.693 --> 05:35.358
Maybe not specifically.

05:35.360 --> 05:36.794
They like dudes with money.

05:36.796 --> 05:37.895
Well talk about the brewery.

05:37.897 --> 05:39.563
Girls love entrepreneurs.

05:39.565 --> 05:40.931
I think you have
to have some sales

05:40.933 --> 05:42.301
to be considered
an entrepreneur.

05:43.401 --> 05:44.869
You're a beersmith
with 10 years'

05:44.871 --> 05:46.105
homebrewing experience.

05:47.405 --> 05:48.806
And no sales.

05:48.808 --> 05:50.741
Just forget about the sales.

05:50.743 --> 05:52.375
Look, think about it this way.

05:52.377 --> 05:55.081
We make a premium product with
locally sourced ingredients.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.748
We should tell them about
the manure field across

05:57.750 --> 05:59.783
the street, that
oughta get them going.

05:59.785 --> 06:00.586
Very funny.

06:02.922 --> 06:03.723
There she is.

06:08.728 --> 06:09.593
Let's go say hi.

06:09.595 --> 06:10.395
No, you go.

06:12.899 --> 06:14.899
Look, all you have to do

06:14.901 --> 06:16.567
is stand there,
make conversation

06:16.569 --> 06:18.104
and not spill your drink on her.

06:19.805 --> 06:22.172
Come on, man, you know I've
been on a dry spell lately.

06:22.174 --> 06:22.975
Fine.

06:24.143 --> 06:26.010
Talk about the brewery.

06:26.012 --> 06:27.280
Don't mention the sales.

06:29.782 --> 06:31.348
Thank you.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.783
You should try the beer.

06:32.785 --> 06:33.851
Oh my God.

06:33.853 --> 06:34.952
Hi.

06:34.954 --> 06:35.922
How are you guys?

06:36.789 --> 06:38.488
Not too bad.

06:38.490 --> 06:40.257
Haven't seen you around
these parts in a while.

06:40.259 --> 06:42.295
I know, my parents
moved to Florida.

06:43.428 --> 06:44.795
How dare they?

06:46.799 --> 06:48.431
What have you been up to lately?

06:48.433 --> 06:51.101
I'm in the city, I just got
my masters in graphic design.

06:51.103 --> 06:53.971
Ohhh, a little
grad-schoolery, very nice.

06:53.973 --> 06:56.943
Yeah, what about you, are
you still coaching baseball?

06:57.777 --> 06:58.842
Football.

06:58.844 --> 07:00.544
Football, right.

07:00.546 --> 07:01.879
Anybody can coach baseball.

07:01.881 --> 07:04.381
Football's a chess
match with people.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.983
My mistake.

07:05.985 --> 07:08.953
More importantly, Mitchell
and I are starting a brewery.

07:08.955 --> 07:10.520
That's so cool.

07:10.522 --> 07:12.556
Well it's not official yet,
we just began the process...

07:12.558 --> 07:15.826
Sure it is, sure it is,
we got a keg right here.

07:15.828 --> 07:16.994
Bangall Brewers, wow.

07:16.996 --> 07:18.362
Do you like beer?

07:18.364 --> 07:20.998
Eh, it all kinda
tastes the same to me.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.466
Ahhh, you just haven't
tried the right beer yet.

07:23.468 --> 07:24.971
Well what do you recommend?

07:25.905 --> 07:27.571
Brewmaster?

07:27.573 --> 07:29.573
Try ours, I bet
you'll like it.

07:29.575 --> 07:30.975
Okay.

07:30.977 --> 07:32.876
It's funny that you mention
you're a graphic designer,

07:32.878 --> 07:37.014
because Mitchell and I,
we're looking for somebody to

07:37.016 --> 07:39.482
design our logo, if that's
something you'd be interested in.

07:39.484 --> 07:40.252
Sure.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.753
Great, do you have
a business card?

07:42.755 --> 07:43.556
I do.

07:50.262 --> 07:52.029
Great, oh, you're in Brooklyn.

07:52.031 --> 07:53.496
We're gonna be there tomorrow.

07:53.498 --> 07:54.999
Oh really, what for?

07:55.001 --> 07:56.400
We're throwing a
little tasting party

07:56.402 --> 07:57.901
for one of our investors.

07:57.903 --> 07:58.836
Fancy.

07:58.838 --> 07:59.905
Very fancy, very exclusive.

08:01.340 --> 08:03.240
Well, I'll be sure
to try out the beer.

08:03.242 --> 08:05.042
Let us know what you think.

08:05.044 --> 08:06.509
I will.

08:06.511 --> 08:07.346
Bye.

08:12.351 --> 08:13.684
I'm in love with that chick.

08:13.686 --> 08:15.953
If you're gonna use the brewery
to try and pick up girls,

08:15.955 --> 08:18.090
can you not lie about
us having investors?

08:19.258 --> 08:20.791
What are you talking about?

08:20.793 --> 08:22.860
You made it sound like
your cousin already invested.

08:22.862 --> 08:24.795
Trust me, he's good for it.

08:24.797 --> 08:26.897
And what was that
shit about a logo?

08:26.899 --> 08:28.232
She's a graphic designer.

08:28.234 --> 08:29.967
We're not hiring
her to do a logo.

08:29.969 --> 08:32.238
Look, all I did was
get her business card.

08:33.305 --> 08:34.371
It's called networking.

08:34.373 --> 08:35.141
Right.

08:37.977 --> 08:39.412
You think she'll like the beer?

08:40.279 --> 08:41.113
She'll like it.

08:43.082 --> 08:45.049
So we're at this beer
festival in Vermont.

08:45.051 --> 08:47.951
And this lumberjack dude
wants to fight, right.

08:47.953 --> 08:49.887
So I take my shirt off.

08:49.889 --> 08:52.089
I tell him I don't wanna
get blood on my clothes,

08:52.091 --> 08:54.992
and unless he wants me to
rip that Red Sox jersey

08:54.994 --> 08:56.994
off his back, he
should do the same.

08:56.996 --> 08:58.896
So he takes his shirt off.

08:58.898 --> 09:00.433
Then I start taking
off my pants.

09:01.567 --> 09:03.233
And he's like, what
the hell are you doing?

09:03.235 --> 09:05.836
So I'm looking at him and
I'm like, you wanna fight me?

09:05.838 --> 09:07.738
You take off your fucking pants.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.441
He's like, hell no, no way,
man, I'm not gonna do that.

09:10.443 --> 09:11.942
So then I just start
screaming at him.

09:11.944 --> 09:13.977
I'm like, take off your
fucking pants, be a man

09:13.979 --> 09:16.080
and take off your fucking pants!

09:16.082 --> 09:18.315
So he starts unbuttoning his
pants, and just when he's got

09:18.317 --> 09:20.751
them around his
ankles, I bum rush him.

09:20.753 --> 09:22.321
And this massive scrum starts.

09:23.589 --> 09:24.490
Yeah, it was crazy.

09:25.958 --> 09:28.027
And then what happened?

09:29.361 --> 09:30.963
Security guards broke it up.

09:33.599 --> 09:34.467
Wow.

09:36.802 --> 09:37.935
It's actually ironic,

09:37.937 --> 09:40.003
because I hate violence.

09:40.005 --> 09:42.106
But I will say, when
you're in a situation

09:42.108 --> 09:44.308
when somebody wants
to just pummel you...

09:44.310 --> 09:45.676
Does anybody need a drink?

09:45.678 --> 09:47.277
Oh, no, fine, thanks.

09:47.279 --> 09:48.548
Yeah, I'll take a beer.

09:59.992 --> 10:01.293
Double fisting?

10:04.363 --> 10:05.831
Somebody's gotta drink it.

10:06.966 --> 10:08.067
I haven't tried it yet.

10:12.705 --> 10:13.540
Here.

10:16.008 --> 10:17.007
Cheers.

10:17.009 --> 10:17.810
Cheers.

10:22.248 --> 10:23.015
I like it.

10:24.316 --> 10:26.218
You still think all
beer tastes the same?

10:27.386 --> 10:28.187
Yours is,

10:29.822 --> 10:30.656
unique.

10:33.058 --> 10:35.492
So how long have you
been making beer?

10:35.494 --> 10:36.228
About 10 years.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.229
10 years, wow,
that's a long time.

10:39.231 --> 10:41.331
Brett and I started making
it when we were in college,

10:41.333 --> 10:43.734
and it kinda became
an addiction.

10:43.736 --> 10:45.404
Brewing, or drinking?

10:46.872 --> 10:47.673
I guess both.

10:49.375 --> 10:52.042
I didn't know you were
still friends with Brooks.

10:52.044 --> 10:53.343
I'm not really.

10:53.345 --> 10:55.179
I'm pretty sure his
mom made him invite me.

10:55.181 --> 10:56.113
Why?

10:56.115 --> 10:57.881
My dad and I did
some work on the house

10:57.883 --> 10:59.049
back in the spring.

10:59.051 --> 11:00.450
What kind of work?

11:00.452 --> 11:02.221
Just some stuff
to the front porch.

11:04.190 --> 11:05.457
Will you show it to me?

11:08.694 --> 11:09.596
Are you serious?

11:10.863 --> 11:11.697
Yeah.

11:12.898 --> 11:13.699
Okay.

11:20.973 --> 11:24.107
So this used to be enclosed,
but Brooks' parents found

11:24.109 --> 11:26.109
a photograph of the
house from the 1800s

11:26.111 --> 11:28.548
that showed the original
porch with these columns,

11:29.381 --> 11:30.716
so they had us restore it.

11:31.750 --> 11:32.718
It's beautiful.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.222
My dad designed it.

11:38.057 --> 11:39.591
You know, I
think it's great that you

11:39.593 --> 11:41.425
and Brett started a brewery.

11:41.427 --> 11:42.793
We haven't started it yet.

11:42.795 --> 11:45.162
I just finished writing
the business plan.

11:45.164 --> 11:47.766
Well I hope you saved
some money for logo design.

11:50.469 --> 11:53.105
I'm just playing with
you, I'm happy to help.

11:54.173 --> 11:55.140
We'd love that.

11:59.745 --> 12:01.247
The wedding's kinda lame, huh?

12:02.582 --> 12:03.683
Why do you say that?

12:05.251 --> 12:06.620
Too many finance guys.

12:07.621 --> 12:09.121
You don't like finance guys?

12:11.691 --> 12:13.759
I like guys that
work with their hands.

12:17.162 --> 12:18.764
Technically, I'm unemployed.

12:26.839 --> 12:28.274
I'll see you back out there.

12:44.323 --> 12:45.991
How long does it
take to get a beer?

12:47.459 --> 12:50.329
Well, do you want some
of my gin and tonic?

12:51.196 --> 12:52.398
I don't drink spirits.

12:55.134 --> 12:56.302
Dude, what took so long?

12:58.203 --> 13:00.873
Oh, okay, I'll see
you at the, thing.

13:06.746 --> 13:07.679
You seen Grace?

13:07.681 --> 13:09.179
What?

13:09.181 --> 13:10.347
Have you seen Grace?

13:10.349 --> 13:11.350
No.

13:13.553 --> 13:15.555
Dammit, she disappeared.

13:18.390 --> 13:19.992
I'm ready to get outta here.

13:20.660 --> 13:21.825
What are you talking about?

13:21.827 --> 13:23.695
It's still early.

13:23.697 --> 13:24.664
You can stay.

13:26.365 --> 13:27.900
You're supposed
to be my wingman.

13:29.435 --> 13:30.537
You're on your own.

13:36.576 --> 13:37.610
This wedding sucks.

13:50.956 --> 13:51.955
Okay.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.892
Seriously?

13:54.893 --> 13:55.928
Screw it, let's go.

14:05.070 --> 14:06.470
How much got drank?

14:06.472 --> 14:07.638
About half.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.639
That's not so bad.

14:08.641 --> 14:10.209
It was mostly Brett and me.

14:16.915 --> 14:18.949
Thanks, Ronnie, we owe you one.

14:18.951 --> 14:20.417
Yeah, you do.

14:20.419 --> 14:22.319
Hey, you're getting free beer.

14:22.321 --> 14:23.920
So?

14:23.922 --> 14:25.792
So you're in high school,
it's worth more than gold.

14:31.397 --> 14:33.130
Watch, don't spill that?

14:33.132 --> 14:33.932
Just drive.

14:35.501 --> 14:36.500
Where we going?

14:36.502 --> 14:37.570
- Mary's.
- Mary's.

14:50.349 --> 14:52.683
Get the keg in the
growlers, clean it,

14:52.685 --> 14:54.819
and get ready to pour
fresh beer in the morning.

14:54.821 --> 14:55.622
You got it.

15:09.134 --> 15:10.837
Hey, Kurt, can
we get two beers?

15:17.443 --> 15:18.878
Well that was an epic failure.

15:19.879 --> 15:21.478
Ah, forget about it.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.979
Tomorrow night we're
coming out guns a-blazin'.

15:22.981 --> 15:24.383
What if Nick doesn't invest?

15:25.685 --> 15:26.485
He will.

15:30.890 --> 15:32.357
You two look fancy.

15:33.358 --> 15:34.725
We
were at a wedding.

15:34.727 --> 15:36.563
Really? So what
are you doing here?

15:37.996 --> 15:38.832
Ask him.

15:42.134 --> 15:44.334
Slow down, it's not a race.

15:44.336 --> 15:46.069
He's fine.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.504
What are
you, his lawyer?

15:47.506 --> 15:49.707
No, I'm his business partner.

15:49.709 --> 15:51.843
Business partner, since when?

15:51.845 --> 15:53.811
Mitchell and I are
starting a brewery.

15:53.813 --> 15:55.481
That sounds like a bad idea.

15:56.549 --> 15:58.348
Why do you say that?

15:58.350 --> 16:00.385
Well for one thing,
you're both alcoholics.

16:01.654 --> 16:04.356
That's not, relevant.

16:07.092 --> 16:07.993
Excuse me.

16:20.607 --> 16:21.739
What's up, cuz?

16:21.741 --> 16:24.174
What's up, man?

16:24.176 --> 16:25.610
You ready for the
party tomorrow night?

16:25.612 --> 16:26.577
You know it, buddy.

16:26.579 --> 16:27.747
Good, good, good good.

16:29.549 --> 16:32.917
You're still serious about
investing in the brewery, right?

16:32.919 --> 16:33.720
Maybe.

16:36.388 --> 16:40.023
Look, man, Mitchell's
all in on this thing.

16:40.025 --> 16:41.528
He quit his job, he's serious.

16:42.862 --> 16:45.228
Alright, well, let's
just see how the party goes.

16:45.230 --> 16:46.931
What does that mean?

16:46.933 --> 16:49.366
I gotta go, dude,
I'll see you tomorrow.

16:49.368 --> 16:50.768
We're gonna crush it.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.818
You're not working for
your old man anymore?

17:07.820 --> 17:09.085
Nope.

17:09.087 --> 17:11.488
It's not as easy as
it looks, you know.

17:11.490 --> 17:12.623
Making beer?

17:12.625 --> 17:14.291
Running a business.

17:14.293 --> 17:16.059
Maybe if you had some
real Belgian beers in here,

17:16.061 --> 17:17.662
you'd have more customers.

17:17.664 --> 17:19.095
We have Stella.

17:19.097 --> 17:20.430
Ha.

17:20.432 --> 17:21.966
Hear that, Mitchell,
they have Stella.

17:21.968 --> 17:24.735
Hey, this place was a
winery when I bought it.

17:24.737 --> 17:26.303
If you don't like
the beer selection,

17:26.305 --> 17:28.573
you can go someplace else.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.080
Guess we won't
be selling to her.

17:46.491 --> 17:47.292
Call a cab.

17:48.293 --> 17:49.961
I'm gonna hoof it.

17:49.963 --> 17:50.830
Don't be stupid.

17:52.464 --> 17:54.164
I know what to do.

18:05.011 --> 18:05.812
Ronnie.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.549
What are you doing?

18:43.549 --> 18:44.550
All right, Ronnie.

18:47.219 --> 18:48.586
You're in charge now.

18:48.588 --> 18:49.587
You got it?

18:49.589 --> 18:50.723
Yeah, you can go now.

18:51.591 --> 18:53.924
Hey, show some respect.

18:53.926 --> 18:56.228
Shut up, Brett.
Help me with the keg.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.605
Don't belittle me
in front of Ronnie.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.380
You drive there,
I'll drive back?

19:18.517 --> 19:21.054
So this is an all-expenses-paid
business trip, right?

19:22.121 --> 19:24.354
I'll pay for half the gas.

19:24.356 --> 19:25.723
What about incidentals?

19:25.725 --> 19:27.525
What incidentals?

19:27.527 --> 19:29.627
I don't know, entertainment?

19:29.629 --> 19:31.263
We're going to the
city for one night.

19:32.464 --> 19:33.396
I'm not spending my
hard-earned money

19:33.398 --> 19:35.066
on entertainment for you.

19:35.068 --> 19:36.634
We'll take it outta
Nick's investment.

19:36.636 --> 19:38.703
Nick's investment is going
towards a real brewing system.

19:38.705 --> 19:39.970
If he invests.

19:39.972 --> 19:41.539
He told
me he wants to.

19:41.541 --> 19:42.940
And you believe him?

19:42.942 --> 19:44.575
He's fucking loaded.

19:44.577 --> 19:45.578
What does he even do?

19:46.746 --> 19:48.378
Think he's trying
to be an actor.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.747
Great.

19:49.749 --> 19:50.750
He's rich.

19:53.119 --> 19:54.785
You just worry about
throwing the best goddamn

19:54.787 --> 19:55.586
tasting party ever.

19:55.588 --> 19:57.088
Okay.

19:57.090 --> 19:59.592
We're Bangall Fuckin' Brewers,
and we're coming in hot.

20:01.627 --> 20:03.761
And I can't get in.

20:58.785 --> 20:59.683
Hello.

21:27.747 --> 21:29.713
Hey, there they are,

21:29.715 --> 21:32.752
a couple of hayseeds
in the big city.

21:33.719 --> 21:34.720
Oh.

21:35.755 --> 21:38.856
KC, grab a photo of
me with these guys.

21:43.196 --> 21:45.563
Hey, KC, this is my cousin
Brett, this is Mitchell.

21:45.565 --> 21:46.666
Hey, how's it going?

21:48.901 --> 21:51.168
So, uh, what's
the photo shoot for?

21:51.170 --> 21:52.903
KC's sports drink.

21:52.905 --> 21:53.773
Here, check it out.

21:57.076 --> 21:58.008
Try it.

21:58.010 --> 21:58.744
Yeah?

22:06.418 --> 22:07.852
Interesting.

22:07.854 --> 22:09.720
What's in it?

22:09.722 --> 22:10.890
Electrolytes.

22:12.859 --> 22:14.627
How's
the brewery, boys?

22:15.862 --> 22:18.028
We're just trying to
get it off the ground.

22:18.030 --> 22:20.363
These guys are starting
a microbrewery upstate.

22:20.365 --> 22:22.066
Oh, very cool.

22:22.068 --> 22:24.268
We're having a little
tasting party tonight.

22:24.270 --> 22:27.771
Oh, my invitation must
have gotten lost in the mail.

22:27.773 --> 22:29.807
I put an invite on Instagram.

22:29.809 --> 22:31.809
I don't follow you anymore.

22:31.811 --> 22:33.043
Why not?

22:33.045 --> 22:34.412
You post too much, man.

22:36.883 --> 22:38.483
This fuckin' guy.

22:39.719 --> 22:41.754
You guys should regram
on your company account.

22:43.322 --> 22:45.089
We don't have a
company account.

22:45.091 --> 22:46.092
Seriously?

22:47.293 --> 22:48.491
Not yet.

22:48.493 --> 22:49.627
Are you on Twitter?

22:49.629 --> 22:50.594
Nope.

22:50.596 --> 22:51.762
- Snapchat?
- Nope.

22:51.764 --> 22:52.665
VK?

22:53.900 --> 22:55.566
What's VK?

22:55.568 --> 22:56.401
Nevermind.

22:57.336 --> 22:58.771
We don't even have a logo.

23:01.107 --> 23:03.473
We should invite Grace
to the party tonight.

23:03.475 --> 23:04.775
Why?

23:04.777 --> 23:06.577
She said she'd
design our logo.

23:06.579 --> 23:07.945
She was being nice.

23:07.947 --> 23:09.447
She gave me her business card.

23:10.583 --> 23:11.449
Is she hot?

23:12.852 --> 23:13.653
Very.

23:14.687 --> 23:15.487
Invite her.

23:19.358 --> 23:22.026
You guys wanna go grab
some Brooklyn beers?

23:22.028 --> 23:23.594
Yes.

23:23.596 --> 23:24.995
KC, you wanna come?

23:24.997 --> 23:27.432
Nah, I gotta hang back
and break down this shit.

23:30.870 --> 23:33.005
So, Nicky, how's the
acting thing going?

23:34.840 --> 23:36.208
I need to fire my agent.

23:39.011 --> 23:40.277
Okay.

23:47.954 --> 23:50.790
Like a
mythical phoenix maybe.

23:52.892 --> 23:54.959
I don't know why there's
two different logos.

23:54.961 --> 23:56.360
So, last time I was here,

23:56.362 --> 23:58.030
I had sex in the bathroom.

23:58.965 --> 23:59.966
It was awesome.

24:00.866 --> 24:01.734
That is awesome.

24:03.803 --> 24:06.303
So, Nick, not to put
you on the spot, but

24:06.305 --> 24:09.707
how serious are you about
investing in the brewery?

24:09.709 --> 24:11.474
Depends on how
good the beer is.

24:11.476 --> 24:14.747
If the beer's good, I can
write you a check tonight.

24:15.915 --> 24:17.149
Really?

24:18.584 --> 24:20.050
Actually, uh, well,

24:20.052 --> 24:22.319
I just invested in
KC's sports drink,

24:22.321 --> 24:25.255
so I'll have to move
some money around.

24:25.257 --> 24:27.591
It might take a few days.

24:27.593 --> 24:30.861
So you're investing in a
sports drink and a brewery?

24:30.863 --> 24:33.364
Yeah, I'm not gonna put
all my eggs in one basket.

24:33.366 --> 24:34.834
This fuckin' guy.

24:38.404 --> 24:39.205
Elvis.

24:44.910 --> 24:45.909
Hey, my man.

24:45.911 --> 24:46.710
How are you?

24:46.712 --> 24:48.245
Good.

24:48.247 --> 24:51.048
This is my cousin
Brett, this is Mitchell.

24:51.050 --> 24:52.182
Elvis.

24:52.184 --> 24:54.752
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

24:54.754 --> 24:55.919
You want a beer?

24:55.921 --> 24:58.355
No, I'm crazy busy,
what do you need?

24:58.357 --> 24:59.390
Just one.

25:07.633 --> 25:10.968
So, hey, we're having a party
tonight, for their brewery.

25:10.970 --> 25:12.236
You should come.

25:12.238 --> 25:14.104
You guys have a brewery?

25:14.106 --> 25:15.939
We will soon, hopefully.

25:15.941 --> 25:17.274
That's scary.

25:17.276 --> 25:18.909
Why?

25:18.911 --> 25:20.112
Such a corrupt industry.

25:21.781 --> 25:24.081
The beer companies
have a total monopoly.

25:24.083 --> 25:26.218
Did they teach you
that in business school?

25:27.820 --> 25:29.453
You have an MBA?

25:29.455 --> 25:30.988
I didn't graduate.

25:30.990 --> 25:33.123
Isn't it a little late
to be starting a brewery?

25:33.125 --> 25:35.059
I feel like the craft beer
market's pretty saturated.

25:35.061 --> 25:37.561
Not for the type
of beer we're making.

25:37.563 --> 25:39.165
Why, is it
boysenberry flavored?

25:40.833 --> 25:43.767
No, but we do have
a proprietary recipe.

25:43.769 --> 25:45.838
I bet Sam Adams is
shitting themselves.

25:47.273 --> 25:49.773
I don't know, I guess it's all
about branding, right, Nick?

25:49.775 --> 25:50.674
Mm-hmm.

25:50.676 --> 25:51.608
I gotta get outta here.

25:51.610 --> 25:52.843
All right, see you tonight?

25:52.845 --> 25:53.646
We'll see.

26:03.089 --> 26:05.856
So is he your
friend or your dealer?

26:05.858 --> 26:06.659
He's my friend.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.662
He just also happens
to be my dealer.

26:11.330 --> 26:12.264
I'll be right back.

26:17.002 --> 26:18.604
So this is our
anchor investor?

26:19.805 --> 26:21.674
What, you got
somebody else in mind?

26:22.975 --> 26:23.974
I'm gonna call Grace.

26:23.976 --> 26:24.975
Seriously?

26:24.977 --> 26:26.112
What do you care?

26:28.147 --> 26:29.613
Voicemail.

26:29.615 --> 26:31.115
Don't leave a message.

26:31.117 --> 26:32.483
I'm gonna leave a message.

26:32.485 --> 26:34.053
Hey, Grace, it's Brett.

26:35.354 --> 26:37.054
Just wanted to remind you
that Mitchell and I are having

26:37.056 --> 26:39.123
a tasting party tonight.

26:39.125 --> 26:40.525
I wanted to see if
you could drop by,

26:40.527 --> 26:43.794
maybe talk logos, hang
out, that whole thing.

26:43.796 --> 26:45.863
I'll text you the deets,
just hope you can make it,

26:45.865 --> 26:47.998
and, yeah, get back to me.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.135
All right, see you.

26:51.971 --> 26:54.740
That was a 10 out of 10 on
the voicemail scale, I think.

26:57.143 --> 26:59.078
You guys wanna go back
to my place.

27:08.387 --> 27:11.655
You guys sure you
don't want any of this?

27:11.657 --> 27:13.090
No, thanks.

27:13.092 --> 27:13.893
I'm good.

27:16.328 --> 27:18.061
You guys are lame.

27:18.063 --> 27:20.900
I don't know if I can go into
business with such lame-o's.

27:28.874 --> 27:31.675
You guys see my Instagram?

27:31.677 --> 27:32.610
No.

27:32.612 --> 27:34.614
Check it out, check it out.

27:43.189 --> 27:44.223
Nice.

27:46.358 --> 27:48.761
Will people even come
to a party on a Sunday?

27:50.597 --> 27:51.598
Wait, it's Sunday?

27:53.399 --> 27:54.200
Yeah.

27:56.235 --> 27:57.604
Yeah, sure.

28:05.545 --> 28:07.645
Brett, will you come
here for a second?

28:07.647 --> 28:08.447
Huh?

28:16.755 --> 28:18.121
What's up?

28:18.123 --> 28:21.124
Why didn't you tell me
Nick was a fucking cokehead?

28:21.126 --> 28:22.759
I wouldn't call
him a cokehead.

28:22.761 --> 28:25.095
Brett, he's about to do
an eight-ball by himself.

28:25.097 --> 28:26.566
That's not an eight-ball.

28:28.668 --> 28:30.834
Look, if he doesn't
write us a check,

28:30.836 --> 28:32.137
we don't have a backup plan.

28:33.573 --> 28:35.172
I know that.

28:35.174 --> 28:37.174
Well, he's your cousin,
so you deal with him.

28:37.176 --> 28:38.342
Okay, fine.

28:39.613 --> 28:41.180
I'm okay.

28:42.181 --> 28:43.182
He's okay.

28:52.925 --> 28:54.126
Text from Grace.

28:55.595 --> 28:56.495
What'd she say?

28:57.963 --> 29:01.534
Got your message. Sounds
like fun. I'll try to stop by.

29:03.035 --> 29:04.167
Fuck yeah.

29:04.169 --> 29:05.603
- Hello!
- Whoo!

29:05.605 --> 29:06.803
- Oh.
- What I tell you?

29:06.805 --> 29:08.338
It is on!

29:08.340 --> 29:10.440
Woo-hoo, yeah it is.

29:10.442 --> 29:12.278
Hey, remember,
you're my wingman.

29:27.293 --> 29:28.959
Tilt your cup.

29:28.961 --> 29:29.795
Not that much.

29:34.133 --> 29:35.198
There you go.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.001
Thanks.

29:37.236 --> 29:38.703
Bangall Brewers,
tell your friends.

29:38.705 --> 29:39.903
You want me to take over?

29:39.905 --> 29:40.740
No, I got it.

29:42.174 --> 29:43.175
I gotta say,

29:45.244 --> 29:47.246
first tasting party's
a full success.

29:48.682 --> 29:50.349
People will drink
anything that's free.

29:52.318 --> 29:54.251
You know, you just
have to say something

29:54.253 --> 29:56.019
negative, don't you?

29:56.021 --> 29:57.689
Look around.

29:57.691 --> 29:59.024
Everybody's smiling.

29:59.925 --> 30:01.160
She loves the beer.

30:01.994 --> 30:03.761
This shit's pretty good.

30:03.763 --> 30:07.665
Right, it's liquid gold,
that's what I'm saying.

30:07.667 --> 30:10.367
But, I have to say
I prefer Duvelle.

30:10.369 --> 30:11.203
You mean Duvel.

30:12.404 --> 30:14.173
I think it's Duvelle.

30:15.874 --> 30:17.009
It's both, actually.

30:18.243 --> 30:19.176
How's that?

30:19.178 --> 30:21.244
In Belgium they say Duvel.

30:21.246 --> 30:22.682
Everywhere else, it's Duvelle.

30:24.718 --> 30:25.552
What's it mean?

30:26.619 --> 30:27.951
Devil.

30:27.953 --> 30:28.788
She's here.

30:32.759 --> 30:34.257
Hey.

30:34.259 --> 30:35.892
Hi.

30:35.894 --> 30:37.227
Thanks for coming.

30:37.229 --> 30:38.696
Of course.

30:38.698 --> 30:40.931
Oh, we gotta put
these booties on,

30:40.933 --> 30:43.400
because house rules, you know?

30:43.402 --> 30:45.102
Oh, okay, sure.

30:45.104 --> 30:46.771
My cousin's trying
to keep his floors clean.

30:46.773 --> 30:48.271
This is different.

30:48.273 --> 30:49.241
I know, right?

30:50.376 --> 30:52.077
These are kinda funny.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.215
So, how you doing?

30:57.316 --> 30:59.216
I'm a little hungover.

30:59.218 --> 31:00.452
Hair of the dog.

31:02.388 --> 31:04.121
Who's place is this?

31:04.123 --> 31:06.490
Oh, it's Nick's,
he's my cousin.

31:06.492 --> 31:08.961
Cool, well, I'll
see you in there.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.566
Hey.

31:15.568 --> 31:16.335
Hey.

31:17.503 --> 31:19.436
Thanks for coming.

31:19.438 --> 31:21.171
Of course.

31:21.173 --> 31:22.007
How's it going?

31:23.242 --> 31:25.342
I drank too much
wine last night.

31:25.344 --> 31:27.010
You shoulda switched to beer.

31:27.012 --> 31:29.314
Wow, you guys like
traveling beer salesmen?

31:30.282 --> 31:32.351
Just beer enthusiasts.

31:35.020 --> 31:38.856
Ladies and gentlemen, can
I have your attention please

31:38.858 --> 31:39.925
for just a moment?

31:41.427 --> 31:46.263
Thank you so much for being
here for the first ever

31:46.265 --> 31:49.299
Bangall Brewers tasting party.

31:49.301 --> 31:50.467
Let's hear it

31:50.469 --> 31:54.337
for my cousin Brett, and
Mitchell, and Mitchell.

31:54.339 --> 31:55.305
Both of them.

31:57.777 --> 31:58.944
They brewed all the beer.

32:01.614 --> 32:05.182
Please, just let them
know what you think of it.

32:05.184 --> 32:07.384
They're doing a little
marketing research.

32:07.386 --> 32:10.320
And thank you so much for
wearing the shoe covers.

32:10.322 --> 32:11.656
That's very much appreciated,

32:11.658 --> 32:14.057
and no smoking on the roof.

32:14.059 --> 32:15.992
I've already been fined for it,

32:15.994 --> 32:17.327
and I will send you the bill.

32:17.329 --> 32:19.564
I will find your home, and I
will send it to all of you.

32:19.566 --> 32:21.031
Thank you so much.

32:21.033 --> 32:25.837
I just wanna give a
shout-out to Elvis.

32:25.839 --> 32:27.971
He knows what I'm talking about.

32:27.973 --> 32:29.907
All right, please
enjoy yourselves.

32:29.909 --> 32:31.009
And, uh,

32:32.411 --> 32:33.412
let's party.

32:38.685 --> 32:41.485
So, how do you like the beer?

32:41.487 --> 32:42.486
I like it.

32:42.488 --> 32:43.688
You do?

32:43.690 --> 32:45.155
Mm-hmm.

32:45.157 --> 32:46.389
That's awesome.

32:46.391 --> 32:47.859
Mitchell and I are
really excited for you

32:47.861 --> 32:49.527
to be part of the team.

32:49.529 --> 32:51.495
I'm a part of the team now?

32:51.497 --> 32:52.431
Hell yeah.

32:53.999 --> 32:54.832
I'm honored.

32:54.834 --> 32:55.568
Cheers.

32:57.537 --> 32:58.368
Cheers.

32:58.370 --> 32:59.271
Cheers.

33:01.373 --> 33:02.374
Hey, Brett.

33:05.277 --> 33:06.078
Excuse me.

33:09.549 --> 33:12.783
Do you wanna go smoke
a cigarette on the roof?

33:12.785 --> 33:14.251
I don't smoke.

33:14.253 --> 33:15.420
Neither do I.

33:20.392 --> 33:23.460
God, I just wanna
take this view home with me.

33:23.462 --> 33:24.463
I know.

33:26.064 --> 33:27.734
How'd you get into
graphic design?

33:29.201 --> 33:31.604
I went to art school,
and I needed to make money.

33:33.940 --> 33:34.741
Makes sense.

33:36.441 --> 33:39.075
I've been thinking
about your logo.

33:39.077 --> 33:40.377
Maybe it would
help if you told me

33:40.379 --> 33:42.412
a little bit more
about the beer.

33:42.414 --> 33:44.414
What do you wanna know?

33:44.416 --> 33:45.217
Anything.

33:46.118 --> 33:47.552
Well, it's our
favorite kind of beer.

33:47.554 --> 33:49.087
It's called a Belgian Dubbel.

33:50.422 --> 33:52.489
Why do you like it?

33:52.491 --> 33:56.059
Do you want the short answer
or the beer geek answer?

33:56.061 --> 33:57.160
The beer geek answer.

33:57.162 --> 33:58.729
Like all the way beer geek?

33:58.731 --> 34:00.397
Full geek.

34:00.399 --> 34:05.002
Okay, well, a Belgian
Dubbel, to me at least, is

34:05.004 --> 34:09.840
the perfect balance between
maltiness, fruit and spice.

34:09.842 --> 34:11.842
It's full-bodied, it
has tons of flavor,

34:11.844 --> 34:14.077
but it's not so heavy
that it knocks you out

34:14.079 --> 34:15.113
after one glass.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.983
Did you come up with
the recipe yourself?

34:18.985 --> 34:20.651
Not really, we used
a traditional recipe,

34:20.653 --> 34:22.853
but we have a secret ingredient.

34:22.855 --> 34:24.454
What's the secret ingredient?

34:24.456 --> 34:25.455
I can't tell you that.

34:25.457 --> 34:27.123
Only Brett and I know.

34:27.125 --> 34:29.326
Come on, I thought I
was a part of the team.

34:29.328 --> 34:31.094
I don't want you
stealing my recipe.

34:31.096 --> 34:33.600
Okay, I promise I
won't start a brewery.

34:34.634 --> 34:35.666
Okay.

34:35.668 --> 34:36.468
Beet sugar.

34:37.937 --> 34:39.770
My aunt grows beets on her farm,

34:39.772 --> 34:42.207
and we use beet sugar
instead of candi syrup.

34:43.475 --> 34:44.944
Wow, that was easy.

34:46.478 --> 34:48.378
Belgian brewing is all about
using whatever you can get

34:48.380 --> 34:50.715
your hands on, even if

34:50.717 --> 34:52.317
you have to break a few rules.

35:01.193 --> 35:04.296
So why did Brett invite
me tonight and not you?

35:06.899 --> 35:09.468
I don't know, you gave
Brett your card, not me.

35:15.642 --> 35:16.643
What?

35:18.678 --> 35:20.647
You look like you
did in high school.

35:23.515 --> 35:24.516
So do you.

35:27.587 --> 35:29.521
I sorta had a crush
on you back then.

35:31.523 --> 35:32.524
Really?

35:35.828 --> 35:37.928
I thought you liked Brett.

35:37.930 --> 35:38.831
Why?

35:40.033 --> 35:41.433
I don't know,
he thinks you did.

35:51.176 --> 35:53.178
This beer kinda
sneaks up on you, huh?

35:54.747 --> 35:56.681
Yeah, it's kind of strong.

35:56.683 --> 35:57.550
You still like it?

35:58.718 --> 35:59.418
I do.

36:01.054 --> 36:02.586
Good.

36:27.947 --> 36:30.280
So this is my dog Meatball.

36:30.282 --> 36:32.652
He's so funny, I
just, I love him.

36:34.654 --> 36:35.955
And this is my mom.

36:37.957 --> 36:40.225
She dated the bass
player in REO Speedwagon.

36:42.628 --> 36:43.896
Will you excuse me a second?

36:53.940 --> 36:55.338
Hey, man, good beer.

36:55.340 --> 36:56.674
Thanks.

36:56.676 --> 36:58.508
I'm gonna be so
hungover tomorrow.

36:58.510 --> 37:01.746
Fortunately, Useful's
great for hangovers.

37:01.748 --> 37:03.116
What the fuck is Useful?

37:04.150 --> 37:06.016
My sports drink.

37:06.018 --> 37:07.651
Oh, right.

37:07.653 --> 37:08.919
So let me ask you something.

37:08.921 --> 37:10.489
How did you convince
Nick to invest?

37:11.858 --> 37:12.792
Invest in what?

37:13.960 --> 37:14.761
Your company.

37:20.265 --> 37:22.499
Nick didn't invest in Useful.

37:22.501 --> 37:23.868
He didn't?

37:23.870 --> 37:25.803
No, I mean, he helps
out with some stuff

37:25.805 --> 37:27.638
but he didn't put any money in.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.707
He doesn't have any money.

37:29.709 --> 37:31.341
I thought he was loaded.

37:31.343 --> 37:35.045
His parents are loaded,
he's broke as shit.

37:35.047 --> 37:36.881
Well, how does he
afford this apartment?

37:36.883 --> 37:38.816
This is his
parents' apartment.

37:38.818 --> 37:40.951
You think he pays the rent here?

37:40.953 --> 37:43.053
He owes me 500 bucks.

37:43.055 --> 37:45.656
Look, he talks a big game,
but he doesn't have money

37:45.658 --> 37:47.292
to be investing in anything.

37:48.393 --> 37:49.896
You didn't hear that
from me, though.

37:51.831 --> 37:52.832
Right.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.841
I gotta talk to you.

38:25.898 --> 38:27.166
Tried the beer lately?

38:28.333 --> 38:29.168
What?

38:33.405 --> 38:35.206
There's something
wrong with it.

38:35.208 --> 38:37.107
Tastes bitter.

38:37.109 --> 38:38.678
What are you talking about?

38:41.547 --> 38:44.416
Maybe I'm just sick
of it, I don't know.

38:48.187 --> 38:50.923
Nick didn't invest in that
sports drink, he's broke.

38:53.626 --> 38:54.390
Says who?

38:54.392 --> 38:55.928
KC, it's his company.

38:57.129 --> 38:58.631
Did you know this
the whole time?

38:59.765 --> 39:01.098
Did I know this
the whole time?

39:01.100 --> 39:02.600
Is that what you're seriously
saying to me right now?

39:02.602 --> 39:04.301
Are we just here
because you wanted to have

39:04.303 --> 39:05.368
a fucking party?

39:05.370 --> 39:09.405
Oh my God, you and
this fucking brewery.

39:09.407 --> 39:11.308
If you didn't wanna
start a brewery with me,

39:11.310 --> 39:12.912
you should've just been honest.

39:16.716 --> 39:17.984
Where'd you go with Grace?

39:19.719 --> 39:20.452
What?

39:21.888 --> 39:23.654
I saw you two leave
together, a little while ago.

39:23.656 --> 39:25.055
Where'd you go?

39:25.057 --> 39:26.592
She wanted to see the roof.

39:28.460 --> 39:29.262
How was it?

39:30.897 --> 39:32.464
What do you mean how was it?

39:33.566 --> 39:34.466
How was the roof?

39:40.405 --> 39:41.774
Yeah, I fucking saw you.

39:44.610 --> 39:47.079
She never liked
you, Brett, okay?

39:48.446 --> 39:50.080
You know what, Mitchell?

39:50.082 --> 39:50.850
Fuck you.

39:52.652 --> 39:53.753
And fuck the brewery.

39:55.453 --> 39:56.987
Have fun with Grace.

39:56.989 --> 39:59.957
If you just wanna be a
football coach in a shitty town,

39:59.959 --> 40:00.760
go for it.

40:04.130 --> 40:05.663
I'm gonna give you
to the count of three

40:05.665 --> 40:07.099
to get the fuck outta my face.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.335
Or I'm bringing the pain.

40:11.938 --> 40:12.705
One.

40:13.539 --> 40:14.373
Two.

40:19.679 --> 40:21.314
You're not even
fucking worth it.

40:24.350 --> 40:25.683
Dick.

40:44.303 --> 40:45.235
Hey.

40:45.237 --> 40:46.203
Hey.

40:46.205 --> 40:47.738
I gotta get outta here.

40:47.740 --> 40:49.206
What happened?

40:49.208 --> 40:51.043
Nothing, I just can't
deal with Brett right now.

40:52.912 --> 40:54.580
Okay, let's get outta here.

41:09.328 --> 41:10.096
Thanks.

41:12.598 --> 41:14.266
I'm sorry I don't
have any beer.

41:17.770 --> 41:19.338
I'll drink anything right now.

41:20.539 --> 41:23.007
That sucks about
Brett's cousin.

41:23.009 --> 41:24.110
I should have known.

41:25.378 --> 41:27.747
Well can't you raise
money from someone else?

41:31.516 --> 41:33.183
Probably not.

41:33.185 --> 41:33.953
I don't.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.721
Well don't give up.

41:37.723 --> 41:39.189
Even if I found
another investor,

41:39.191 --> 41:41.027
I can't start a
brewery by myself.

41:45.097 --> 41:47.233
I'll still help
you design the logo.

41:49.802 --> 41:50.934
Thanks.

42:45.091 --> 42:46.092
Hey.

42:46.992 --> 42:47.993
Hey.

42:57.303 --> 42:58.802
What do you think?

42:58.804 --> 42:59.605
Wow.

43:02.475 --> 43:03.609
It's great, thank you.

43:05.545 --> 43:06.345
My pleasure.

43:10.883 --> 43:12.518
I have to go to work.

43:13.686 --> 43:14.954
Yeah, of course.

43:17.690 --> 43:20.491
I realized I don't
even have your number.

43:20.493 --> 43:21.528
Give me your phone.

43:33.906 --> 43:35.341
Are you going back to Bangall?

43:37.510 --> 43:38.310
Yep.

43:39.245 --> 43:40.880
Well say bye to Brett for me.

43:41.847 --> 43:42.616
Yeah.

43:44.383 --> 43:45.151
What?

43:47.086 --> 43:48.988
Brett saw us on
the roof last night.

43:51.023 --> 43:51.824
And?

43:54.026 --> 43:55.394
And he has a thing for you.

43:57.229 --> 43:59.064
Why are you even
telling me this?

44:00.666 --> 44:02.067
I don't know, I'm
just telling you.

44:04.604 --> 44:07.371
I feel like we're back
in high school again.

44:07.373 --> 44:08.908
I know, I know.

44:10.943 --> 44:12.776
Let's just not make a
bigger deal out of this

44:12.778 --> 44:13.580
than we have to.

44:15.047 --> 44:15.848
Okay.

44:42.374 --> 44:43.974
Well keep me
posted on the brewery.

44:43.976 --> 44:44.910
I will.

44:45.978 --> 44:46.779
Bye.

45:43.302 --> 45:44.303
Hey.

45:45.471 --> 45:46.272
Hey.

45:47.806 --> 45:48.608
Where's Brett?

45:50.776 --> 45:52.177
I think he left.

45:56.215 --> 45:57.850
Hey, we kicked the
keg last night.

45:59.351 --> 46:01.220
People were raving
about it all night.

46:03.355 --> 46:04.823
So you still wanna invest?

46:06.125 --> 46:08.861
You know, I think
it's a little early.

46:10.129 --> 46:11.995
I could be more
helpful when you guys

46:11.997 --> 46:13.198
are a little farther along.

46:15.501 --> 46:16.302
Right.

46:37.890 --> 46:39.356
Hey, Mitchell.

46:39.358 --> 46:40.857
Yeah.

46:40.859 --> 46:42.662
Can you take this
on your way out?

46:48.568 --> 46:50.336
Good luck with the brewery.

48:20.125 --> 48:20.991
Hey.

48:20.993 --> 48:21.828
Hey.

48:23.696 --> 48:25.295
What's up?

48:25.297 --> 48:27.266
When was the last time
you talked to Brett?

48:28.333 --> 48:29.101
A while.

48:30.502 --> 48:31.805
What's your guys' deal?

48:33.640 --> 48:34.440
I don't know.

48:37.811 --> 48:39.044
What's going on in here?

48:40.345 --> 48:41.548
I'm
shutting it down.

48:42.381 --> 48:44.114
Why?

48:44.116 --> 48:45.951
Can't keep pouring
money down the drain.

48:47.519 --> 48:49.319
How am I supposed
to get beer now?

48:49.321 --> 48:51.056
I don't know
what to tell you, Ronnie.

48:55.127 --> 48:57.695
Brett asked me to come
over to his place today.

48:57.697 --> 48:58.896
And?

48:58.898 --> 49:00.665
And, I asked if you
were gonna be there

49:00.667 --> 49:02.332
and he hung up on me.

49:02.334 --> 49:03.235
What happened?

49:05.204 --> 49:07.473
Brett was never serious
about starting a brewery.

49:09.041 --> 49:10.375
I could have told you that.

49:12.177 --> 49:13.512
There's some other stuff too.

49:15.514 --> 49:17.347
What about the brewery?

49:17.349 --> 49:19.719
This isn't a brewery,
Ronnie, it's a garage.

49:25.190 --> 49:26.858
You should call Brett.

49:26.860 --> 49:28.093
I'm worried about him.

49:58.023 --> 49:59.258
Drinking spirits, huh?

50:02.862 --> 50:03.630
What's that?

50:05.264 --> 50:06.533
It's from the last batch.

50:11.538 --> 50:12.872
What have you been up to?

50:16.576 --> 50:17.877
Pretty much looking at it.

50:26.553 --> 50:29.556
I need to talk
to you about Grace.

50:34.994 --> 50:37.329
I kissed her at the wedding.

50:40.132 --> 50:40.934
I knew it.

50:42.301 --> 50:43.570
I could sense that shit.

50:47.339 --> 50:48.675
You really double-crossed me.

50:50.577 --> 50:52.011
What is this, Spy vs. Spy?

50:58.417 --> 50:59.752
So are you and her still?

51:00.920 --> 51:02.319
No.

51:02.321 --> 51:03.088
What happened?

51:05.190 --> 51:07.459
I called her, she
didn't call me back.

51:08.360 --> 51:09.627
Why not?

51:09.629 --> 51:10.630
I don't know.

51:18.503 --> 51:20.337
Is that cold?

51:20.339 --> 51:21.772
Yeah.

51:21.774 --> 51:23.543
Why don't you
pour us a couple.

51:24.978 --> 51:25.778
Sure.

52:00.512 --> 52:02.982
So, how's carpentry going?

52:05.985 --> 52:06.886
I need the money.

52:08.087 --> 52:10.487
Bet your dad's happy.

52:10.489 --> 52:11.256
I guess.

52:14.259 --> 52:16.062
So is that it for
Bangall Brewers?

52:17.597 --> 52:18.598
Do you care?

52:21.734 --> 52:23.567
You don't have to pretend
like it's your thing too.

52:23.569 --> 52:24.369
I get it.

52:46.358 --> 52:47.225
Grace made this?

52:48.795 --> 52:49.562
Yep.

52:52.230 --> 52:53.032
I like it.

52:54.634 --> 52:56.268
At least we went
out with a bang.

52:58.705 --> 53:00.439
Not exactly a blaze of glory.

53:04.610 --> 53:06.646
So if you could tell
I wasn't into it,

53:08.313 --> 53:09.615
why didn't you say anything?

53:11.951 --> 53:13.385
I needed a partner.

53:16.723 --> 53:18.057
I wanted to be into it.

53:19.257 --> 53:21.094
I just, love my job.

53:25.598 --> 53:26.599
You're lucky.

53:32.138 --> 53:34.605
We should throw a
going-out-of-business party.

53:34.607 --> 53:35.606
We were never in business.

53:35.608 --> 53:36.807
You know what I mean.

53:36.809 --> 53:37.610
How much is left?

53:39.011 --> 53:39.812
One keg.

53:41.413 --> 53:42.582
Might as well use it.

53:57.797 --> 53:59.264
Hey, Brooks, hey, Meredith.

54:02.501 --> 54:04.170
You guys wanna
play some foot cup?

54:08.775 --> 54:09.673
Go.

54:09.675 --> 54:10.977
Go go go go go.

54:19.852 --> 54:21.652
Oh come on, Ronnie.

54:23.823 --> 54:25.490
Come on, come on.

54:38.503 --> 54:39.304
Woo-hoo!

54:40.540 --> 54:41.339
Woo-hoo!

54:42.975 --> 54:44.241
Eat that!

54:44.243 --> 54:45.976
All right, fill 'em
up, we're going again.

54:45.978 --> 54:46.846
Hand your cups in.

54:51.316 --> 54:53.416
So why aren't you
guys doing the brewery?

54:53.418 --> 54:55.054
Our investor didn't
have any money.

54:56.989 --> 54:57.855
Bummer.

54:57.857 --> 54:58.858
Yeah.

55:00.026 --> 55:01.592
Well it's good beer,
you should keep making it.

55:01.594 --> 55:03.227
Yeah, I'd buy it.

55:03.229 --> 55:05.328
Thanks, but I think
this is the last batch

55:05.330 --> 55:07.767
of Bangall Brewers. You
all should feel honored.

55:08.701 --> 55:10.536
What are you gonna do with
all the brewing equipment?

55:11.436 --> 55:12.271
I don't know.

55:15.007 --> 55:16.909
I'll take it off
your hands if you want.

55:23.716 --> 55:25.448
Remember, this is
for personal use only.

55:25.450 --> 55:27.517
No selling to your friends.

55:27.519 --> 55:28.353
Of course.

55:29.421 --> 55:31.722
Don't brew anything
I wouldn't brew.

55:31.724 --> 55:32.859
What does that mean?

55:34.293 --> 55:35.094
Nevermind.

55:36.428 --> 55:37.263
Anything else?

55:38.097 --> 55:38.898
Yeah.

55:39.866 --> 55:41.767
Here, you'll need this.

55:43.202 --> 55:44.804
Now get outta here
before I change my mind.

56:14.901 --> 56:16.166
What's this?

56:16.168 --> 56:17.902
It's our beer.

56:17.904 --> 56:20.139
I hear you're not
starting a brewery anymore.

56:21.274 --> 56:22.806
That's right.

56:22.808 --> 56:23.843
That's a shame.

56:24.810 --> 56:25.811
Yeah.

56:26.846 --> 56:28.848
Let me guess, you
feel like a failure.

56:30.349 --> 56:31.782
Pretty much.

56:31.784 --> 56:34.785
Don't beat yourself up, my
first two businesses failed.

56:34.787 --> 56:36.320
Ours didn't
even get off the ground.

56:36.322 --> 56:37.123
So what?

56:38.858 --> 56:40.259
You can keep the growler.

56:41.260 --> 56:43.294
Mitchell, hold on a second.

56:43.296 --> 56:45.031
I wanna talk to you
about something.

56:47.967 --> 56:50.167
I need to hire a bartender.

56:50.169 --> 56:51.835
Kurt's going back to school.

56:51.837 --> 56:54.371
You know anyone who
might be interested?

56:54.373 --> 56:56.439
Not that I can think of.

56:56.441 --> 56:57.376
What about you?

56:58.878 --> 57:00.544
I don't wanna be a bartender.

57:00.546 --> 57:01.547
How do you know?

57:04.550 --> 57:07.053
Come here for a second, I
wanna show you something.

57:21.634 --> 57:23.636
You know what these are?

57:25.304 --> 57:26.469
Wine tanks?

57:26.471 --> 57:27.905
Actually, they're dairy tanks,

57:27.907 --> 57:29.842
but they were used
for making wine.

57:30.676 --> 57:32.176
Now, here's what I'm thinking.

57:32.178 --> 57:33.911
You take the bartender job.

57:33.913 --> 57:35.879
You brew whatever
you want down here,

57:35.881 --> 57:37.550
and we'll serve it at the bar.

57:39.251 --> 57:41.885
Can you even make
beer in these things?

57:41.887 --> 57:43.687
That's up to you.

57:51.397 --> 57:55.001
Let me know by Friday, or I
have to look for somebody else.

58:33.706 --> 58:34.473
Hey.

58:35.808 --> 58:36.609
What's up?

58:37.943 --> 58:39.812
Mary offered me
a job bartending.

58:43.816 --> 58:44.617
No shit.

58:47.119 --> 58:49.455
She also said I could
use the bar to make beer.

58:50.923 --> 58:52.256
Really?

58:52.258 --> 58:54.560
Yeah, she's got wine
tanks down in the basement.

58:56.429 --> 58:57.229
Hmm.

58:59.765 --> 59:01.434
I'd have to cut
you out, though.

59:05.071 --> 59:07.573
No more using the brewery
to pick up chicks.

59:11.811 --> 59:12.945
Never worked anyway.

59:19.852 --> 59:22.655
It's cool with me,
under one condition.

59:26.192 --> 59:27.493
I get free beer for life.

59:35.134 --> 59:37.034
I don't know if
I should do it.

59:37.036 --> 59:38.802
Feels backwards to me.

59:38.804 --> 59:41.171
You're not gonna be happy
unless you're making beer.

59:41.173 --> 59:42.606
You should do it.

59:47.113 --> 59:48.013
Say hi to Mary for me.

59:55.387 --> 59:56.188
Shit.

1:00:00.693 --> 1:00:01.528
Who won?

1:00:03.530 --> 1:00:04.330
We got killed.

1:00:05.231 --> 1:00:06.997
Again?

1:00:06.999 --> 1:00:09.201
Back off, I have a
dyslexic quarterback.

1:00:11.137 --> 1:00:12.004
What was the score?

1:00:13.639 --> 1:00:14.373
28-nothing.

1:00:17.009 --> 1:00:18.342
Want a Stella?

1:00:18.344 --> 1:00:20.144
Don't fuck with me.

1:00:30.089 --> 1:00:32.055
So when you getting
Bangall Brewers on tap?

1:00:32.057 --> 1:00:34.391
It's not gonna be
called Bangall Brewers.

1:00:34.393 --> 1:00:35.194
Why not?

1:00:37.329 --> 1:00:38.864
I feel like I
need a fresh start.

1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:43.167
What's it gonna
be called then?

1:00:43.169 --> 1:00:44.236
I don't know.

1:00:46.939 --> 1:00:48.207
Let me see these tanks.

1:01:01.687 --> 1:01:02.521
Wow.

1:01:05.191 --> 1:01:07.527
Think about how much beer
you're gonna be able to make.

1:01:18.204 --> 1:01:19.703
What's the holdup?

1:01:19.705 --> 1:01:22.439
I gotta give the tanks a
good scrubbing this weekend.

1:01:22.441 --> 1:01:23.610
You're welcome to join.

1:01:26.879 --> 1:01:28.080
Sounds like a lotta work.

1:01:31.250 --> 1:01:32.619
You hear from Grace yet?

1:01:33.485 --> 1:01:34.286
No.

1:01:36.722 --> 1:01:39.122
I was thinking of taking
the train down to the city

1:01:39.124 --> 1:01:40.726
and just showing up
at her apartment.

1:01:42.428 --> 1:01:43.162
Ballsy.

1:01:44.430 --> 1:01:45.231
Yeah.

1:01:46.265 --> 1:01:47.733
When you gonna go?

1:01:49.268 --> 1:01:50.302
I don't know.

1:01:51.237 --> 1:01:52.471
It's probably a bad idea.

1:01:55.441 --> 1:01:56.643
I think you should do it.

1:02:00.012 --> 1:02:01.447
You don't have to take
the train, though.

1:02:02.748 --> 1:02:03.683
What do you mean?

1:02:05.451 --> 1:02:07.150
I'm in possession of
an automotive vehicle

1:02:07.152 --> 1:02:09.920
that I think could do the job.

1:02:31.810 --> 1:02:33.345
She could tell me to fuck off.

1:02:35.281 --> 1:02:36.547
Well then we'll fuck off.

1:02:36.549 --> 1:02:37.751
And you can drive
on the way back.

1:02:39.619 --> 1:02:41.320
Should I buy her
flowers or something?

1:02:43.455 --> 1:02:44.323
Don't be stupid.

1:02:48.628 --> 1:02:49.529
She have roommates?

1:02:51.163 --> 1:02:52.697
No.

1:02:52.699 --> 1:02:53.631
Fuck.

1:03:07.146 --> 1:03:07.913
I'm nervous.

1:03:10.883 --> 1:03:12.051
Don't worry about it.

1:03:13.319 --> 1:03:15.354
Just go up there,
ring her doorbell.

1:03:17.189 --> 1:03:18.591
I don't know
what I'm gonna say.

1:03:21.327 --> 1:03:22.328
It'll come to you.

1:03:23.862 --> 1:03:26.666
And if it doesn't come to you,
just, I don't know, whatever.

1:03:28.334 --> 1:03:29.401
What the hell?

1:03:32.071 --> 1:03:33.906
Is that Nick?

1:03:36.175 --> 1:03:37.343
Oh come on.

1:03:40.045 --> 1:03:41.180
Holy shit.

1:03:49.121 --> 1:03:50.022
I'm sorry, dude.

1:03:52.858 --> 1:03:54.358
Let's just get outta here.

1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:55.894
I don't know what
chicks see in him.

1:03:57.863 --> 1:03:58.598
Let's just go.

1:04:02.401 --> 1:04:03.568
You okay?

1:04:03.570 --> 1:04:04.370
Yeah.

1:04:05.538 --> 1:04:06.740
Yeah, I'm okay.

1:04:12.579 --> 1:04:13.379
No loyalty.

1:04:20.419 --> 1:04:22.252
Well technically, I'm not
part of the company, but

1:04:22.254 --> 1:04:24.287
more of a brand ambassador.

1:04:24.289 --> 1:04:25.823
What does that entail?

1:04:25.825 --> 1:04:29.326
Well, I help out with business
development, partnerships.

1:04:29.328 --> 1:04:30.730
Taste tests, that kinda thing.

1:04:31.564 --> 1:04:33.296
Do you get paid?

1:04:33.298 --> 1:04:35.432
No, but I do get free beer,

1:04:35.434 --> 1:04:37.602
which is way better than money.

1:04:37.604 --> 1:04:38.502
Do you want another one?

1:04:38.504 --> 1:04:39.604
Sure.

1:04:39.606 --> 1:04:41.907
Alright, coming right up.

1:04:50.750 --> 1:04:52.184
Making any money off this yet?

1:04:53.152 --> 1:04:53.952
Not really.

1:04:55.622 --> 1:04:56.955
How's it going over there?

1:04:59.425 --> 1:05:00.424
Good.

1:05:00.426 --> 1:05:01.427
She likes the beer.

1:05:02.629 --> 1:05:03.429
Another round?

1:05:05.297 --> 1:05:06.098
Yeah.

1:05:07.266 --> 1:05:08.465
I'll bring 'em over.

1:05:08.467 --> 1:05:09.268
Thanks.
