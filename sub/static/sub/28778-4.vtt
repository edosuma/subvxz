00:01.802 --> 00:02.812
<i>My name is Danny McNamara.</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:04.236
<i>When I left the FBI, I thought</i>

00:04.305 --> 00:06.425
<i>my crime-fighting days were
over, but then I learned</i>

00:06.474 --> 00:08.452
<i>that terrorist Karim Farouk
was on the hunt for Cleopatra,</i>

00:08.476 --> 00:10.576
<i>one of the world's
most valuable treasures,</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:12.478
<i>lost for over 2,000 years,</i>

00:12.546 --> 00:14.947
<i>to use her as part
of a massive terror attack.</i>

00:15.016 --> 00:16.335
<i>To find him, I needed some help,</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:18.917
<i>so I went to Lexi Vaziri,
a thief.</i>

00:18.986 --> 00:21.620
<i>Excuse me, a master thief.</i>

00:21.689 --> 00:23.756
<i>And my father
was killed by Farouk.</i>

00:23.824 --> 00:26.358
<i>Lexi and I have
a complicated past.</i>

00:26.427 --> 00:29.695
<i>He wants to bring Farouk to
justice, I want revenge.</i>

00:29.764 --> 00:31.864
<i>Also, there's a mysterious group</i>

00:31.932 --> 00:33.599
<i>who want Cleopatra
as much as we do.</i>

00:33.667 --> 00:36.301
<i>We're not sure
whether they're good or bad,</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:37.848
<i>but the one thing
we all agree on...</i>

00:37.872 --> 00:39.671
<i>Is that we need
to find Cleopatra...</i>

00:41.275 --> 00:44.376
<i>Before Farouk does.</i>

00:44.445 --> 00:46.311
<i>Previously on</i>
Blood and Treasure...

00:46.380 --> 00:49.114
<i>The Nazis believed
that some sacred objects</i>

00:49.183 --> 00:50.482
held actual power.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.684
<i>Farouk left everything
from Cleopatra's tomb,</i>

00:52.753 --> 00:55.554
<i>but what did he take?
Antony's sarcophagus.</i>

00:55.623 --> 00:58.791
<i>What if he wants to reunite
Cleopatra with Antony,</i>

00:58.859 --> 01:01.794
turn an artifact into a
weapon of mass destruction?

01:01.862 --> 01:03.862
I am Captain Bruno Fabi
of the Carabinieri...

01:03.931 --> 01:05.397
art and antiquities crimes.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.732
What's this?

01:06.801 --> 01:08.133
The medallion says "Serapis,"

01:08.202 --> 01:09.468
an ancient deity that had

01:09.537 --> 01:11.214
<i>a cult following
in the years of Cleopatra.</i>

01:11.238 --> 01:13.739
<i>They must be her protectors.</i>

01:13.808 --> 01:14.973
Doctor, this is a dead end.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.242
No, Max, this is a door.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.722
"All those who disturb
the sacred tomb

01:18.746 --> 01:21.013
"will come to know swift death

01:21.082 --> 01:23.715
and be cursed for all eternity."

01:23.784 --> 01:26.318
Come here.
It's good to see you, Chuck.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.153
Danny's a complicated guy.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.756
He follows rules and does
the right thing unfailingly.

01:30.825 --> 01:32.591
He's the furthest thing
from complicated.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.820
You and Danny have a lot more
in common than you think.

01:35.729 --> 01:36.995
Simon Hardwick.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.875
Guys like us should stick
together, shouldn't we,

01:38.899 --> 01:40.899
Special Agent McNamara?

01:40.968 --> 01:42.234
We find Cleopatra,

01:42.303 --> 01:43.335
<i>we'll find Farouk.</i>

01:43.404 --> 01:45.270
Cleopatra's in Germany.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.371
Well done, Omar.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.779
<i>Farouk went to a lot of
effort to get that photograph.</i>

01:53.848 --> 01:56.281
He's gonna go to wherever
it was taken.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.943
Not so fast, Liebchen.

02:25.012 --> 02:28.147
Meet our guest of honor.

02:28.215 --> 02:32.084
Elke, say hello to Cleopatra,

02:32.153 --> 02:33.886
the future of the Reich.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.922
But she's dead. For now.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.057
But soon she will rise again.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.959
And the world
will have no choice

02:41.028 --> 02:42.961
but to bow to the Fatherland.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.596
Ah.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.599
Heinz, everybody, please,
please join us.

02:47.668 --> 02:51.803
We must commemorate this moment
of Nazi victory.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.620
Air raid! Colonel Steiner!

03:02.917 --> 03:07.252
Colonel Steiner, get Cleopatra
safely to our alternate site

03:07.321 --> 03:08.921
and continue with the project.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.656
We shall protect her
with our lives.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.724
Heinz, assemble the men.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.026
Yes, Herr Colonel.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.627
Bring up the truck now. Move!

03:49.730 --> 03:51.496
Nazis.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.232
They sure love their castles.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.133
They were all about nostalgia

03:55.202 --> 03:57.469
for a storybook world
that never actually existed.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.071
So they were angry
Ren fair nerds.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.640
Genocidally angry
Ren fair nerds, yeah.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.476
This picture of Cleopatra
could have been taken

04:04.545 --> 04:06.411
in any of a hundred
different castles.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.046
But I e-mailed
an intel analyst friend

04:08.249 --> 04:11.984
from my FBI days who now
consults at a video game studio.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.412
He's working
on a World War II game

04:13.454 --> 04:15.487
that has a whole level
in a Nazi castle.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.488
He sent tons of research
we can look at,

04:17.558 --> 04:19.024
try to narrow things down. Good,

04:19.093 --> 04:20.570
because Farouk's heading there,
wherever "there" is,

04:20.594 --> 04:22.234
and I've got a bullet
with his name on it.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.364
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.901
Chuck. You look...

04:29.970 --> 04:31.169
awful.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.972
What a pleasant welcome
from a guest in my own home.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.674
Irish flu.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.175
I had to end class early.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.344
Are you still hungover?

04:39.413 --> 04:41.558
Well, yeah,
I can't drink like I used to.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.416
Chuck, you drink wine
literally every day at work.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.519
Ah, yes, but technically
that is not wine.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.187
When did you guys get so chummy?

04:49.256 --> 04:52.357
Eh, now that I've gotten
to know your girlfriend...

04:52.426 --> 04:53.603
Not his girlfriend.
She's not my girlfriend.

04:53.627 --> 04:58.630
Uh-huh. I can see
that my previous doubt was

04:58.699 --> 05:00.732
a little extreme. Doubts?

05:00.801 --> 05:01.881
You said she was the devil.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.201
Aw, that was before

05:03.270 --> 05:07.039
we bonded over making fun
of you, actually.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.908
I learned all sorts
of interesting things.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.321
Uh... don't worry, nothing

05:11.345 --> 05:12.711
that you said during confession.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.048
And yet, still so much
to be embarrassed about.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.920
Is, uh, is that a picture
of a bunch of Nazis posing

05:21.989 --> 05:23.199
in front of the coffin
of Cleopatra in a castle?

05:23.223 --> 05:24.990
Yeah, 'cause that seems

05:25.059 --> 05:26.958
like that's probably a big deal.

05:27.061 --> 05:28.994
Right? Like,
historically speaking?

05:29.063 --> 05:32.798
Big enough deal that Farouk
killed somebody to get it.

05:35.169 --> 05:38.070
Inspector Karlsson,
I got your message.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.639
It was conspicuously brief,
even for you.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.074
I didn't want to give
too much away

05:42.142 --> 05:44.843
over a non-secure phone line.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.752
Don't tell me that
you're buying into this idea

05:46.814 --> 05:48.513
that Farouk has
a mole somewhere.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.981
Conspiracies...

05:50.050 --> 05:52.362
People tend to see them in the
face of inexplicable tragedy.

05:52.386 --> 05:55.120
There's nothing inexplicable
about it, Captain Fabi.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.255
Asim Masood told Danny
he thought Farouk had a mole

05:57.324 --> 05:59.524
in Egyptian intelligence,
and now he's dead.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.626
At least he didn't die in vain.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.972
You found something
in the evidence

06:02.996 --> 06:04.029
from Farouk's safe house

06:04.098 --> 06:05.430
that Danny and Lexi found?

06:05.499 --> 06:06.965
Yeah, I think so.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.934
Communications with this man,

06:09.002 --> 06:10.168
Taj bin Yusef.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.537
He ran finances
for Farouk's organization.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.539
They disappeared
at the same time.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.007
And he appears to be back.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.843
And he may have Antony.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.278
Where? Tripoli.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.592
I'm sending over the information
to Libyan authorities right now.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.851
Well done, Agent Karlsson.

06:25.919 --> 06:29.054
Let me know if the Libyans
find anything.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.561
<i>Pronto.</i>

06:41.268 --> 06:43.635
Guys, check it out.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.071
I think I found our castle.

06:46.140 --> 06:49.341
Castle Schädelberg,
near the Austrian border.

06:49.410 --> 06:52.911
Nazis did major reconstruction,
but research says

06:52.980 --> 06:55.313
it was just to stabilize
the castle.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.915
It's sitting on bedrock
in an area

06:56.984 --> 06:58.717
not known for seismic activity.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.186
This is a lot of buildup.
Better be worth it.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.821
The castle was under the purview

07:02.890 --> 07:05.991
of the Institute
for Occult Warfare.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.861
Okay. We might actually be
getting somewhere. That...

07:09.930 --> 07:12.364
looks appropriately ominous.

07:12.399 --> 07:15.600
Doing construction for stability
is a great excuse

07:15.636 --> 07:17.402
if you're trying to hide
from the world

07:17.471 --> 07:19.871
you're building a resting place
for Cleopatra.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.740
Sounds like it was
worth the buildup.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.942
Whose side are you on? Mine.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.911
Wh-When did that start
being a question?

07:25.979 --> 07:27.345
Look, Reece's jet's on standby.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.915
We can be there
before nightfall.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.851
Want to come with,
for old times?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.519
No.

07:34.588 --> 07:38.356
No. Last thing I need
is a flight over Macho Grande

07:38.425 --> 07:39.591
with you two.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.026
Where's Macho Grande?

07:41.094 --> 07:42.594
Nowhere near where we're going.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.429
Chuck's just bad at geography.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.065
And yet I always know
the lay of the land.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.868
Have fun storming the castle!

07:54.875 --> 07:56.808
Guten Tag.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.482
Of course. How may I help you?

08:03.550 --> 08:05.717
Are you the girl
in this photograph?

08:08.789 --> 08:10.121
Where did you get this?

08:10.190 --> 08:11.823
Uh, don't be alarmed.

08:11.892 --> 08:15.594
I'm a doctoral student
working on a research paper

08:15.662 --> 08:18.497
about Egyptian antiquities
during the Second World War.

08:18.565 --> 08:23.134
It was a long time ago,
but, yes, that's me.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.604
And-and that is my grandfather.

08:25.672 --> 08:29.441
Ah. Anything you can tell me
about where this was taken

08:29.510 --> 08:31.142
would be a great help.

08:31.211 --> 08:34.279
Well, I-I, I don't get
many visitors these days,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.448
but please come in.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.118
I may have some other photos

08:40.187 --> 08:43.188
that would help
with your article.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.191
How do you take your tea?

08:46.260 --> 08:49.027
I will not be having any tea.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.882
It's too late. Antony's gone.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.284
Over here!

09:16.523 --> 09:18.356
Max Najjar?

09:33.307 --> 09:34.673
Fabi?

09:34.741 --> 09:36.007
Max.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.842
How'd you find me?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.644
The Brotherhood
has been looking for you,

09:39.713 --> 09:41.212
ever since the attack
on the pyramid.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.449
We never leave
one of our own behind.

09:44.518 --> 09:46.262
One of Farouk's safe houses
was taken down yesterday.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.286
Intel led us here.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.255
Thank you for saving me.

09:50.324 --> 09:51.556
Tell me, Max.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.725
Everyone else was killed
in the explosion.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.760
How did you survive?

09:55.829 --> 09:58.063
It was a miracle.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.099
Praise God.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.834
And the terrorists
who saved you.

10:02.903 --> 10:06.705
What? They didn't save me.
They kidnapped me.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.206
They tortured me.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.719
The Brotherhood suspected
as much at first.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.277
Imagine our surprise
when we discovered

10:12.346 --> 10:14.045
the payments you took.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.880
What, what payments?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.716
Don't lie to me, Max.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.585
Farouk paid you to tell him
where to find Cleopatra.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.754
And when she wasn't there,
you must have

10:22.823 --> 10:24.189
realized they would kill you.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.559
So you offered to inform
on the Brotherhood to Farouk.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.894
I-I would never betray
the Brotherhood.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.764
Where did they take Antony?

10:32.833 --> 10:34.566
Why do they want Cleopatra?

10:34.635 --> 10:35.635
I don't know.

10:54.182 --> 10:55.782
If you want to hang back here,

10:55.851 --> 10:57.484
let me lead, it's cool.

10:57.552 --> 11:00.420
Seeing as it's your first time
casing a joint.

11:00.489 --> 11:02.589
Just, when us good guys do it,

11:02.658 --> 11:04.257
it's called
"surveillance." Yeah...

11:04.359 --> 11:05.792
not exactly the same thing.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.130
Welcome.

11:10.198 --> 11:13.266
I am your guide
through this beautiful castle.

11:13.335 --> 11:15.468
Unfortunately, we are
still waiting for two persons,

11:15.537 --> 11:17.771
- but I think...
- Hi.

11:17.839 --> 11:19.973
We're here for the 4:00 tour.

11:20.042 --> 11:21.808
Mr. and Mrs. McNamara?

11:21.877 --> 11:24.277
That's us. Great.

11:26.348 --> 11:28.782
Took your name, did I?

11:28.850 --> 11:30.183
Well, first rule
of surveillance,

11:30.252 --> 11:31.451
have a good cover story.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.086
We're newlyweds. Hmm.

11:33.155 --> 11:35.088
Was that a Southern accent?
Oh, darling.

11:35.157 --> 11:37.257
I've got a whole character
and back story worked out.

11:37.326 --> 11:38.326
Excuse me?

11:38.360 --> 11:39.993
You're so beautiful.

11:40.062 --> 11:41.695
You're such a beautiful couple.

11:41.763 --> 11:44.030
Shall I take a photo of you
in front of the staircase?

11:44.099 --> 11:46.833
Uh, we're good. Thanks.

11:46.902 --> 11:49.602
Okay. L-Let's start the tour.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.673
Never let anyone
take a picture of you.

11:53.742 --> 11:55.942
After you, Mr. McNamara.

11:56.011 --> 11:57.811
Oh, wow.

11:57.879 --> 12:00.046
As you can see on your maps,

12:00.115 --> 12:01.982
this dining room

12:02.050 --> 12:05.318
comes right after
the <i> Ruhmeshalle,</i>

12:05.387 --> 12:07.120
the Great Hall... Excuse me.

12:07.189 --> 12:09.990
Yes? I can listen to medieval
architectural history

12:10.058 --> 12:12.726
all day, it is fascinating.

12:12.794 --> 12:15.495
But my husband here is kind
of a World War II buff.

12:15.564 --> 12:17.731
Guilty as charged.

12:17.799 --> 12:19.699
I do like 'em nerdy.

12:21.303 --> 12:22.880
So could we skip the
lord and peasant stuff

12:22.904 --> 12:24.371
and maybe cut
straight to the Nazis?

12:24.439 --> 12:26.673
If y'all don't mind?

12:26.742 --> 12:28.341
Did they make any
changes to the castle?

12:28.410 --> 12:32.178
The castle's history is
over 700 years old, and...

12:32.247 --> 12:35.415
that dark era
was barely ten years.

12:35.484 --> 12:37.417
But in those ten years,

12:37.486 --> 12:39.919
wh-what specific changes
did they make?

12:39.988 --> 12:42.555
When the war ended,
we Germans promptly removed

12:42.624 --> 12:44.224
all Nazi iconography.

12:44.292 --> 12:46.037
The castle now maintains
much of the original

12:46.061 --> 12:47.327
furniture and features.

12:47.396 --> 12:49.396
As I was saying,
the 13th century

12:49.464 --> 12:50.930
brought some changes.

12:50.999 --> 12:53.166
And if you follow me,
in the <i> Ruhmeshalle</i>

12:53.235 --> 12:56.603
I can show you a very
good example of this.

13:06.581 --> 13:07.747
What? What are you doing?

13:07.816 --> 13:10.717
Change of plans.
Place closes in 20 minutes.

13:10.786 --> 13:13.253
Security system only covers
the doors and windows.

13:13.321 --> 13:16.756
Okay, so we wait for
everyone to leave...

13:16.825 --> 13:19.793
take our
time to find the hidden section

13:19.861 --> 13:21.628
where Cleopatra is.

13:21.696 --> 13:24.097
You see, my apprentice,
there is still

13:24.166 --> 13:26.866
much you have to learn
in the fine art of casing.

13:26.935 --> 13:30.103
Like how to find a bigger closet?

13:30.172 --> 13:31.571
Look, it's not my fault
that people

13:31.640 --> 13:32.939
were smaller back then.

13:33.008 --> 13:34.774
Hmm. Oh.

13:34.843 --> 13:37.377
What? Oh, I see.

13:37.446 --> 13:39.612
Wha...? Oh.

13:41.783 --> 13:44.084
It was the map.
I-It's just the map.

13:46.721 --> 13:48.988
<i>Thank you for
coming, Dr. Castillo.</i>

13:49.057 --> 13:50.457
I assume you have
summoned me here

13:50.525 --> 13:53.126
because there's a break
in the investigation?

13:53.195 --> 13:55.128
Yeah.

13:55.197 --> 13:57.597
Would you be able to, um...

13:57.666 --> 13:59.599
I.D. this man?

14:02.904 --> 14:04.471
That's Max Najjar.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.306
He was killed in
the pyramid attack

14:06.374 --> 14:07.841
along with the rest of my team.

14:07.909 --> 14:09.442
You've recovered his body, then?

14:09.511 --> 14:10.677
Yes.

14:10.745 --> 14:12.679
Tripoli Police found his body.

14:12.747 --> 14:14.247
That doesn't make sense.

14:14.316 --> 14:17.117
We have reason to believe he was
working with the terrorists.

14:17.185 --> 14:18.818
They paid him for information

14:18.887 --> 14:21.287
on Cleopatra.
Max would never do that.

14:21.356 --> 14:23.356
He did.

14:23.425 --> 14:25.091
And he paid the price.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.127
He was apparently tortured
when she wasn't there

14:27.195 --> 14:29.195
and died as a result
of his injuries.

14:29.264 --> 14:31.042
The Carabinieri and I
have been going through.

14:31.066 --> 14:32.866
Max's financial records,

14:32.934 --> 14:35.268
trying to reconstruct the weeks
leading up to the attack.

14:35.337 --> 14:37.804
It would be helpful if we can
have a timeline from you.

14:37.873 --> 14:40.373
For comparison. Of course.

14:40.442 --> 14:42.542
Ever since we entered

14:42.611 --> 14:45.512
Antony and Cleopatra's tomb,
nothing has made sense.

14:47.115 --> 14:50.650
I'm beginning to think
that it is cursed.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.056
So you're sure

14:57.125 --> 14:58.658
there's no security cameras
in here?

14:58.727 --> 15:00.693
Yes. We're good.

15:00.729 --> 15:03.463
They were all at the
entrances of the building.

15:03.532 --> 15:06.299
Oh, amateurs.

15:08.470 --> 15:10.036
Uh-uh.

15:10.105 --> 15:11.838
Don't even think about it.

15:11.907 --> 15:14.374
I was admiring the jewel inlay.

15:14.442 --> 15:17.210
It was sparkling at me
from a... Danny.

15:17.279 --> 15:19.045
Those paintings have alarms
on them.

15:19.114 --> 15:21.247
It's okay, I wasn't gonna steal it.
Hmm.

15:21.316 --> 15:23.082
I noticed something earlier.

15:23.151 --> 15:26.386
This painting is of
the original castle.

15:26.454 --> 15:28.488
You can see
where it's different...

15:28.557 --> 15:30.723
from the map of
the current layout.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.759
This large berm attached here

15:32.827 --> 15:34.594
wasn't in the original castle.

15:34.663 --> 15:35.995
This is where the
Nazis supposedly

15:36.064 --> 15:37.330
needed to stabilize it.

15:37.399 --> 15:39.199
And if Cleopatra's still here,

15:39.267 --> 15:40.833
I guess that's where
she would be.

15:40.902 --> 15:43.203
According to this map,
there's nothing beneath...

15:43.271 --> 15:45.071
the lord's chamber anymore.

15:45.140 --> 15:47.006
Interesting. Very interesting.

15:47.075 --> 15:49.275
Could you believe
there are people out there

15:49.344 --> 15:51.289
in the world... not me,
mind you, but other people...

15:51.313 --> 15:53.947
Who have no idea
why that's important?

15:54.015 --> 15:55.760
This castle would have
been built with a chapel

15:55.784 --> 15:57.383
underneath the lord's chamber.

15:57.452 --> 16:00.253
The Nazis, or these
Nazis in particular,

16:00.322 --> 16:02.222
they were more about making up
their own new,

16:02.290 --> 16:04.857
mystical Aryan religion
than following an old one.

16:04.926 --> 16:06.726
So they got rid of the chapel
to make room

16:06.795 --> 16:08.394
for the hidden section
of the castle?

16:08.463 --> 16:10.296
If I'm right, it's down there.

16:10.365 --> 16:11.898
We just need to
find the basement.

16:15.036 --> 16:16.769
So, how do we access

16:16.838 --> 16:18.471
your secret Nazi lair?

16:20.942 --> 16:22.575
Huh.

16:22.644 --> 16:25.378
Might have something
to do with this.

16:25.447 --> 16:27.213
They called it the black sun.

16:27.282 --> 16:29.148
All right, go ahead.

16:29.217 --> 16:31.117
Explain to me what
the point of all this

16:31.186 --> 16:32.452
Aryan mysticism stuff was.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.031
Maybe it'll help me see a clue.

16:34.055 --> 16:35.922
Well...

16:35.991 --> 16:38.124
they spent a ton
of time and money

16:38.193 --> 16:40.326
trying to prove...

16:40.395 --> 16:43.296
that the master race were Aryans.
Which Cleopatra was not.

16:43.365 --> 16:45.398
No, but the way they saw it,

16:45.467 --> 16:47.400
all of the great works
of mankind,

16:47.469 --> 16:48.835
like the pyramids,

16:48.903 --> 16:50.770
were directly attributable
to these.

16:50.839 --> 16:52.272
"Aryan supermen,"

16:52.340 --> 16:54.340
descended from Atlantis...

16:54.409 --> 16:55.975
Got to be kidding me.

16:56.044 --> 16:59.112
They tried to rediscover
lost ancient and supernatural

16:59.180 --> 17:00.680
technologies to weaponize them.

17:04.886 --> 17:06.752
Danny, these numbers
on the floor.

17:06.820 --> 17:09.355
12, eight, 30. Mean anything?

17:11.092 --> 17:12.759
Cleopatra's death.

17:12.827 --> 17:14.993
August 12, 30 B.C.E.

17:15.063 --> 17:17.262
I'm thinking they also
might be the combination

17:17.332 --> 17:19.265
to the lock. What lock?

17:19.334 --> 17:20.599
That one.

17:20.669 --> 17:22.702
You see...

17:22.771 --> 17:25.305
you know
crazy white people history...

17:25.373 --> 17:28.374
I know how thieves think.

17:28.443 --> 17:30.943
Each spoke of the black sun
is a number

17:31.012 --> 17:32.478
one through 12.

17:32.547 --> 17:34.147
Here we go.

17:43.024 --> 17:46.459
12...

17:46.528 --> 17:49.729
eight...

17:49.798 --> 17:51.464
three.

17:54.969 --> 17:57.003
Oh, my.

18:04.045 --> 18:06.079
Not the toughest lock
I've ever cracked,

18:06.147 --> 18:08.114
but since it would have
pissed off the Nazis,

18:08.183 --> 18:09.816
definitely the most satisfying.

18:09.884 --> 18:12.051
I knew there was a reason
I fake-married you.

18:12.120 --> 18:15.088
Keep telling yourself
that's the reason.

18:15.156 --> 18:17.023
Here, hold on.

18:22.497 --> 18:23.696
Whoa.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.666
Uh-huh.

18:28.136 --> 18:31.337
I bet you anything
this is an exact replica

18:31.406 --> 18:33.339
of Cleopatra's tomb.

18:33.408 --> 18:36.509
I mean, I don't love what
they've done with the place.

18:38.313 --> 18:40.446
That's weird.

18:40.515 --> 18:43.683
There's Greek mixed in
with the Egyptian hieroglyphics.

18:43.752 --> 18:45.918
What were these nutters

18:45.987 --> 18:47.253
on about?

18:47.322 --> 18:48.588
I'm not sure if even they knew.

18:48.656 --> 18:50.590
Hitler was nearly always high
on barbiturates,

18:50.658 --> 18:51.791
morphine, and crystal meth.

18:53.328 --> 18:54.560
True story.

18:54.629 --> 18:57.697
How did such idiots
almost take over the world?

18:57.766 --> 18:59.365
Good people didn't
stand up to stop them

18:59.434 --> 19:00.700
until it was too late.

19:00.769 --> 19:02.769
Hey. Check it out.

19:06.975 --> 19:08.508
This...

19:08.543 --> 19:12.879
will help us find out
where they took Cleopatra.

19:26.060 --> 19:29.562
Looks like the castle was
attacked, so they moved her.

19:29.631 --> 19:31.664
They must have left
some clue here

19:31.699 --> 19:33.766
about where they went.

19:37.338 --> 19:38.738
Kreisau Circle.

19:38.807 --> 19:39.939
Goody.

19:40.008 --> 19:41.574
Another secret society.

19:41.643 --> 19:43.176
No, these were the good guys.

19:43.244 --> 19:46.746
German resistance embedded
inside the ranks of the Nazis.

19:46.815 --> 19:48.481
A lot of them were Jesuits.

19:48.550 --> 19:51.818
They considered themselves
protectors of stolen treasure.

19:51.886 --> 19:55.021
The circles often indicated
hidden, coded messages.

20:04.032 --> 20:06.933
Wow.

20:07.001 --> 20:09.669
Saltpeter. Awesome.

20:09.737 --> 20:11.304
Heat-sensitive ink,

20:11.372 --> 20:13.806
invisible unless you know
how to look for it.

20:13.875 --> 20:17.677
There must've been
a Kreisau spy at the castle.

20:17.745 --> 20:21.180
Well, it's unlike any
code I've ever seen.

20:21.249 --> 20:22.949
What do you think it means?

20:23.017 --> 20:24.617
I have no idea,

20:24.686 --> 20:27.520
but Chuck has access
to the Vatican Library.

20:32.493 --> 20:33.459
JARDIANCE asks...

20:33.461 --> 20:34.861
When it comes to
type 2 diabetes,

20:34.863 --> 20:36.262
are you thinking about
your heart?

20:36.264 --> 20:37.663
Well, I'm managing my A1C,

20:37.665 --> 20:39.732
so I should be all set.

20:39.734 --> 20:40.800
Actually, you're still at risk

20:40.802 --> 20:42.435
for a fatal heart attack
or stroke.

20:42.437 --> 20:43.903
That's where JARDIANCE comes in.

20:43.972 --> 20:47.039
It reduces the risk of dying
from a cardiovascular event

20:47.041 --> 20:49.709
for adults who have type 2
diabetes and known heart diseas.

20:49.811 --> 20:52.745
That's why the American Diabetes
Association recommends

20:52.747 --> 20:54.413
the active ingredient
in JARDIANCE.

20:54.415 --> 20:55.715
And it lowers A1C?

20:55.817 --> 20:57.116
With diet and exercise.

20:57.252 --> 20:58.818
<i>JARDIANCE can cause
serious side effects</i>

20:58.820 --> 21:00.119
<i>including dehydration,</i>

21:00.121 --> 21:02.188
<i>genital yeast or
urinary tract infections,</i>

21:02.190 --> 21:03.723
<i>and sudden kidney problems.</i>

21:03.725 --> 21:05.791
<i>Ketoacidosis is a serious
side effect</i>

21:05.793 --> 21:06.793
<i>that may be fatal.</i>

21:06.961 --> 21:09.195
<i>A rare, but life-threatening,
bacterial infection</i>

21:09.197 --> 21:11.531
<i>in the skin of the perineum
could occur.</i>

21:11.533 --> 21:12.298
<i>Stop taking JARDIANCE</i>

21:12.300 --> 21:13.399
<i>and call your doctor right away</i>

21:13.401 --> 21:16.035
<i>if you have symptoms
of this bacterial infection,</i>

21:16.037 --> 21:16.969
<i>ketoacidosis,</i>

21:16.971 --> 21:18.504
<i>or an allergic reaction.</i>

21:18.506 --> 21:19.305
<i>Do not take JARDIANCE</i>

21:19.307 --> 21:20.373
<i>if you are on dialysis</i>

21:20.375 --> 21:22.141
<i>or have severe kidney problems.</i>

21:22.243 --> 21:23.676
<i>Taking JARDIANCE
with a sulfonylurea</i>

21:23.678 --> 21:25.645
<i>or insulin may cause
low blood sugar.</i>

21:25.780 --> 21:26.780
So, what do you think?

21:26.881 --> 21:29.815
Now I feel I can do more
to go beyond lowering A1C.

21:29.817 --> 21:37.817
<i>Ask your doctor about
JARDIANCE today.</i>

21:47.402 --> 21:48.846
Now I feel I can do more
to go beyond lowering A1C.

21:48.870 --> 21:50.503
Hey Allergy Muddlers...

21:50.538 --> 21:51.203
ACHOO!

21:51.239 --> 21:53.539
Do your sneezes turn heads?

21:53.575 --> 21:54.507
Try ZYRTEC...

21:54.542 --> 21:56.309
it starts working hard at
hour one...

21:56.344 --> 22:00.313
And works twice as hard when you
take it again the next day.

22:00.348 --> 22:01.948
ZYRTEC Muddle No More.

22:33.213 --> 22:36.415
HUMIRA patients, you inspire us.

22:36.451 --> 22:39.051
The way you triumph
over adversity.

22:39.087 --> 22:42.622
And live your lives.

22:42.657 --> 22:44.924
That's why we redesigned HUMIRA.

22:44.959 --> 22:46.425
We wanted to make the experience

22:46.461 --> 22:47.560
better for you.

22:47.595 --> 22:49.428
Now there's less
pain immediately

22:49.464 --> 22:50.730
following injection.

22:50.765 --> 22:52.765
We've reduced the size
of the needle

22:52.800 --> 22:55.001
and removed the citrate buffers.

22:55.036 --> 22:56.902
And it has the same
effectiveness you

22:56.938 --> 22:58.871
know and trust.

22:58.906 --> 23:01.407
HUMIRA Citrate-free is here.

23:01.442 --> 23:04.644
A little change can make
a big difference.

23:04.679 --> 23:07.313
HUMIRA can lower your ability
to fight infections.

23:07.348 --> 23:08.948
Serious and sometimes
fatal infections,

23:08.983 --> 23:11.517
including tuberculosis, and
cancers, including lymphoma,

23:11.552 --> 23:12.852
have happened, as have blood,

23:12.887 --> 23:14.387
liver, and nervous system
problems,

23:14.422 --> 23:15.688
serious allergic reactions,

23:15.723 --> 23:17.323
and new or worsening
heart failure.

23:17.358 --> 23:19.470
Tell your doctor if you've been
to areas where certain

23:19.494 --> 23:20.660
fungal infections are common

23:20.695 --> 23:22.561
and if you've had TB,
hepatitis B,

23:22.597 --> 23:25.531
are prone to infections, or have
flu-like symptoms or sores.

23:25.566 --> 23:27.466
Don't start HUMIRA if
you have an infection.

23:28.069 --> 23:28.968
Ask your doctor

23:28.970 --> 23:31.003
about HUMIRA Citrate-free.

23:31.105 --> 23:32.204
Here's to you.

24:45.313 --> 24:46.479
American!

24:58.726 --> 24:59.859
All right, go, go, go!

25:04.165 --> 25:05.931
On the ridge. Got 'em!

25:27.622 --> 25:29.021
All clear.

25:29.090 --> 25:31.757
We're clear!

25:31.826 --> 25:35.895
Okay, I want everyone rounded up
for questioning.

25:38.366 --> 25:41.300
Marwan, find out if anyone
here has seen our guy.

25:45.439 --> 25:47.973
Let's be very careful
with the artifacts.

25:48.042 --> 25:49.882
There's millions worth
of stolen treasure here.

25:51.512 --> 25:52.645
Agent Danny,

25:52.713 --> 25:56.081
one of the men says your
archaeologist is here.

25:58.186 --> 26:00.319
Could be our guy.

26:00.388 --> 26:02.621
Or could be a trap.

26:02.690 --> 26:04.390
Okay, nice and easy.

26:04.458 --> 26:07.226
Check for trip wires.

26:16.504 --> 26:17.803
Are you Simon Hardwick?

26:17.872 --> 26:22.141
I'm Special Agent McNamara, FBI.

26:22.210 --> 26:24.677
We're here to rescue you.

26:24.745 --> 26:26.679
It's okay.

26:26.747 --> 26:30.115
You're gonna be okay.

26:30.184 --> 26:32.852
Medic!

26:32.920 --> 26:34.687
Short, gray hair.

26:34.755 --> 26:37.323
He had these deep set
brown eyes.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.300
So he got away then?

26:48.369 --> 26:51.270
I know this is difficult,
but when we catch him,

26:51.339 --> 26:53.205
we're gonna have you to thank.

26:53.274 --> 26:54.974
How did you find me?

26:55.042 --> 26:57.643
I'm in the FBI's Arts
and Antiquities Division.

26:57.712 --> 26:58.978
British intel alerted us

26:59.046 --> 27:00.713
that an archaeologist
had been kidnapped.

27:00.781 --> 27:03.282
Meanwhile, we've been tracking
a new terrorist on the scene

27:03.351 --> 27:06.352
who's been very well funded.
Hmm.

27:06.387 --> 27:10.155
We've been able to track some of
the blood antiquities he sold.

27:10.224 --> 27:12.291
Did you get any idea
what he might be planning,

27:12.360 --> 27:13.559
or why?

27:15.730 --> 27:18.464
That's him.

27:18.532 --> 27:20.633
His name is Karim Farouk.

27:20.701 --> 27:23.702
He wants revenge,

27:23.771 --> 27:27.539
and he won't stop
until he has it.

27:32.380 --> 27:34.413
Oh, please.

27:34.482 --> 27:36.482
Dealers are such parasites.

27:36.550 --> 27:40.219
All you do is profit.
You don't create.

27:40.288 --> 27:42.488
Parasite's such a nasty word,
don't you think?

27:45.393 --> 27:46.525
<i>Grazie. Prego.</i>

27:46.594 --> 27:48.027
What I do is, uh,

27:48.095 --> 27:50.529
I create the context
for the buyer

27:50.598 --> 27:51.897
that sets an object's value.

27:54.135 --> 27:56.602
Like that necklace
you're wearing, for example.

27:56.671 --> 27:59.505
The craftsmanship's
a bit pedestrian.

27:59.573 --> 28:01.785
Probably purchased from some
mid-tier jewelry market chain,

28:01.809 --> 28:03.776
but the person who bought it
for you is special,

28:03.844 --> 28:06.545
to you, at least.

28:06.614 --> 28:09.214
Maybe someone you're
a bit in love with still,

28:09.283 --> 28:12.384
which is why,
when the chain breaks,

28:12.453 --> 28:14.286
which it's done
a number of times,

28:14.355 --> 28:16.689
you get it fixed again and again
with new links,

28:16.757 --> 28:20.025
making it unique
and priceless to you.

28:20.094 --> 28:22.594
Okay, I get it.

28:22.663 --> 28:24.675
So, what, are you only here
for the gallery opening?

28:24.699 --> 28:26.743
Why don't you join me for
dinner, and I'll tell you...

28:26.767 --> 28:28.178
Mr. Hardwick, we have
some questions for you.

28:28.202 --> 28:30.703
I'm just in the middle
of something rather important.

28:30.771 --> 28:32.104
It was nice to meet you.

28:32.173 --> 28:35.607
Uh... great.

28:35.676 --> 28:37.743
Uh, don't you have
anything better to do

28:37.812 --> 28:39.745
than bother me when
I'm working on something?

28:39.814 --> 28:41.613
Work? That did not
look like work.

28:41.682 --> 28:43.115
Well, not your kind of work.

28:43.184 --> 28:44.861
This isn't about your business,
Mr. Hardwick,

28:44.885 --> 28:46.318
this is a murder investigation.

28:46.387 --> 28:48.253
Max Najjar.

28:48.322 --> 28:49.588
I believe you knew him.

28:49.657 --> 28:52.992
Does anyone really know
anyone these days?

28:53.060 --> 28:54.827
You transferred money
into his account.

28:54.895 --> 28:57.062
Well, in that sense,
I knew him, yes, yes.

28:57.131 --> 28:59.164
Max... Najjar.

28:59.233 --> 29:01.567
Yeah, h-he was in some
financial difficulty,

29:01.635 --> 29:03.435
and he needed to make
a quick sale.

29:03.504 --> 29:06.071
How did Najjar come to work
with Karim Farouk?

29:06.140 --> 29:07.473
How the hell should I know?

29:07.541 --> 29:09.408
Let me break this down for you:

29:09.477 --> 29:12.011
There's no love lost
between me and the man

29:12.079 --> 29:14.513
who held me as a slave
and tortured me for a year.

29:14.582 --> 29:16.342
Maybe you'll also understand
that my business

29:16.384 --> 29:20.252
relies on discretion,
so the only questions I ask

29:20.321 --> 29:23.255
are to establish the provenance
of a piece for sale, that's it.

29:23.324 --> 29:25.758
We will get to the bottom of
this, with or without your help.

29:25.826 --> 29:27.326
Okay. If we find out that you've

29:27.395 --> 29:30.796
been financing terrorism,
knowingly or unknowingly,

29:30.865 --> 29:32.865
you will be treated
exactly the same as them.

29:32.933 --> 29:34.299
Right, that's good to know.

29:34.368 --> 29:36.802
You should make a change to
your plans. Italy will become

29:36.871 --> 29:39.138
a very difficult place
for you to do business.

29:39.206 --> 29:41.173
More difficult than it is now?

29:41.242 --> 29:43.308
Let's go.

29:43.377 --> 29:45.010
The Brotherhood of Serapis.

29:49.316 --> 29:51.884
Does that name
mean anything to you?

29:51.952 --> 29:53.485
What about them?

29:53.554 --> 29:56.188
There are people in this world

29:56.257 --> 29:58.690
that scare me more
than Karim Farouk.

29:58.759 --> 30:01.326
I believe Max was
working for them.

30:01.395 --> 30:03.962
He tried to sell me
this medallion he was wearing.

30:04.031 --> 30:08.400
It had three intertwined
serpents etched on the front.

30:08.469 --> 30:10.402
You want to find out
what happened to Max?

30:10.471 --> 30:12.304
You want to get
to the bottom of this?

30:12.373 --> 30:14.073
I suggest you look into them.

30:14.141 --> 30:15.574
And maybe you'll do me the favor

30:15.643 --> 30:18.177
of not putting my name
on any paperwork,

30:18.245 --> 30:21.380
because if you do,
my blood'll be on your hands.

30:26.953 --> 30:29.755
<i>To most, he's Phil
Mickelson pro golfer.</i>

30:29.790 --> 30:32.091
<i>To me, he's well, dad.</i>

30:32.126 --> 30:34.460
<i>So when his joint pain from
psoriatic arthritis</i>

30:34.495 --> 30:38.330
<i>got really bad it scared me.
And what could that pain mean?</i>

30:38.365 --> 30:40.532
<i>Joint pain could
mean joint damage.</i>

30:40.568 --> 30:42.434
<i>ENBREL helps relieve joint pain</i>

30:42.470 --> 30:44.536
<i>helps stop
irreversible joint damage.</i>

30:44.572 --> 30:47.272
<i>And helps skin get clearer.</i>

30:47.308 --> 30:49.875
<i>ENBREL may lower your

31:10.531 --> 31:13.198
<i>Don't start ENBREL if you have
an infection like the flu.</i>

31:13.234 --> 31:16.468
<i>Since ENBREL, dad's

31:16.504 --> 31:17.736
<i>Visit Enbrel.com</i>

31:17.771 --> 31:18.882
<i>and use the Joint

31:18.906 --> 31:21.340
<i>to see how your joint damage

31:21.375 --> 31:22.975
<i>Ask about ENBREL.</i>

31:23.010 --> 31:31.010

Luxurious.

32:31.679 --> 32:32.444
<i>But what are the smelling?</i>

32:32.680 --> 32:33.512
Wait, it's Suave?

32:33.681 --> 32:34.446
Wow.

32:34.682 --> 32:35.480
It's Bodywash.

32:35.683 --> 32:36.683
No it's not.

32:36.917 --> 32:38.061
I can't believe this is Suave.

32:38.085 --> 32:38.650
Can I take this home?

32:38.886 --> 32:39.886
<i>Suave Body Wash.</i>

32:40.287 --> 32:42.207
<i>Fragrances as Beautiful

32:45.593 --> 32:48.594
Hey! A heart in my Honey Nut
Cheerios.

32:48.629 --> 32:49.728
That's special.

32:49.763 --> 32:52.564
Like a tasty Cereal that can
help lower cholesterol.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.132
Still going to eat you though.

32:54.168 --> 32:56.201
You're not that special.

32:58.305 --> 33:01.240
Ours is a proud bloodline.

33:01.275 --> 33:05.911
We hail from the battlefields to
the badlands.

33:05.946 --> 33:10.682
From the mountains and the
midtowns.

33:10.718 --> 33:15.287
From the islands to the
highlands.

33:15.322 --> 33:18.423
And directly to those who
understand...

33:18.459 --> 33:20.692
That when you get behind the
wheel.

33:20.728 --> 33:23.528
You're not just driving
a Jeep Wrangler.

33:23.564 --> 33:31.564
You're joining a family.

35:49.910 --> 35:52.911
<i>We should stay here until
we figure out our next move.</i>

35:52.980 --> 35:55.480
So, you are very <i>glücklich, ja?</i>

35:55.549 --> 35:56.948
Eh, lucky?

35:57.017 --> 35:59.684
Because of the football match,
we have been booked for months,

35:59.753 --> 36:01.319
but I just spoke with the owner.

36:01.388 --> 36:03.989
He has accepted to liberate
our last room.

36:04.057 --> 36:05.957
It's very, um...

36:06.026 --> 36:07.492
cozy, yeah?

36:07.561 --> 36:10.595
Wonderful. Thanks.

36:10.664 --> 36:12.631
<i>Gute Nacht.</i>

36:12.699 --> 36:14.433
Oh, it's Chuck.

36:14.501 --> 36:16.468
He got my text.

36:16.537 --> 36:18.870
"Interesting photo,
nothing jumps out,

36:18.939 --> 36:20.505
"but I can look
into it tomorrow.

36:20.574 --> 36:25.310
My gut tells me it has something
to do with Macho Grande."

36:25.379 --> 36:28.046
The man's obsessed with
this Macho Grande place.

36:28.115 --> 36:29.548
What's so great about it?

36:29.616 --> 36:32.717
Nothing. It's... Fine.

36:32.786 --> 36:35.520
Don't tell me. He will
next time I get him drunk.

36:35.589 --> 36:37.755
He's gonna check in the
Vatican archives tomorrow

37:13.658 --> 37:14.824
American!

37:27.071 --> 37:28.204
All right, go, go, go!

37:32.510 --> 37:34.277
On the ridge. Got 'em!

37:55.967 --> 37:57.366
All clear.

37:57.435 --> 38:00.102
We're clear!

38:00.171 --> 38:04.240
Okay, I want everyone rounded up
for questioning.

38:06.711 --> 38:09.645
Marwan, find out if anyone
here has seen our guy.

38:13.785 --> 38:16.319

There's millions worth

38:31.035 --> 38:32.735
Okay, nice and easy.

38:32.804 --> 38:35.571
Check for trip wires.

I'm Special Agent McNamara, FBI.

38:50.555 --> 38:53.022
We're here to rescue you.

38:53.091 --> 38:55.024
It's okay.

38:55.093 --> 38:58.461
You're gonna be okay.

Medic!

39:01.266 --> 39:03.032
Short, gray hair.

39:03.101 --> 39:05.668
He had these deep set
brown eyes.

39:14.445 --> 39:16.646
So he got away then?

39:16.714 --> 39:19.615
I know this is difficult,
but when we catch him,

39:19.684 --> 39:21.550
we're gonna have you to thank.

39:21.619 --> 39:23.319
How did you find me?

39:23.388 --> 39:25.988
I'm in the FBI's Arts
and Antiquities Division.

39:26.057 --> 39:27.323
British intel alerted us

39:27.392 --> 39:29.058
that an archaeologist
had been kidnapped.

39:29.127 --> 39:31.627
Meanwhile, we've been tracking
a new terrorist on the scene

39:31.696 --> 39:34.697
who's been very well funded.
Hmm.

39:34.732 --> 39:38.501
We've been able to track some of
the blood antiquities he sold.

39:38.569 --> 39:40.636
Did you get any idea
what he might be planning,

39:40.705 --> 39:41.904
or why?

39:44.075 --> 39:46.809
That's him.

39:46.878 --> 39:48.978
His name is Karim Farouk.

39:49.047 --> 39:52.048
He wants revenge,

39:52.116 --> 39:55.885
and he won't stop
until he has it.

40:00.725 --> 40:02.758
Oh, please.

40:02.827 --> 40:04.827
Dealers are such parasites.

40:04.896 --> 40:08.564
All you do is profit.
You don't create.

40:08.633 --> 40:10.833
Parasite's such a nasty word,
don't you think?

40:13.738 --> 40:14.870
<i>Grazie. Prego.</i>

40:14.939 --> 40:16.372
What I do is, uh,

40:16.441 --> 40:18.874
I create the context
for the buyer

40:18.943 --> 40:20.242
that sets an object's value.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.947
Like that necklace
you're wearing, for example.

40:25.016 --> 40:27.850
The craftsmanship's
a bit pedestrian.

40:27.919 --> 40:30.130
Probably purchased from some
mid-tier jewelry market chain,

40:30.154 --> 40:32.121
but the person who bought it
for you is special,

40:32.190 --> 40:34.890
to you, at least.

40:34.959 --> 40:37.560
Maybe someone you're
a bit in love with still,

40:37.628 --> 40:40.730
which is why,
when the chain breaks,

40:40.798 --> 40:42.631
which it's done
a number of times,

40:42.700 --> 40:45.034
you get it fixed again and again
with new links,

40:45.103 --> 40:48.371
making it unique
and priceless to you.

40:48.439 --> 40:50.940
Okay, I get it.

40:51.009 --> 40:53.020
So, what, are you only here
for the gallery opening?

40:53.044 --> 40:55.089
Why don't you join me for
dinner, and I'll tell you...

40:55.113 --> 40:56.523
Mr. Hardwick, we have
some questions for you.

40:56.547 --> 40:59.048
I'm just in the middle
of something rather important.

40:59.117 --> 41:00.449
It was nice to meet you.

41:00.518 --> 41:03.953
Uh... great.

41:04.022 --> 41:06.088
Uh, don't you have
anything better to do

41:06.157 --> 41:08.090
than bother me when
I'm working on something?

41:08.159 --> 41:09.959
Work? That did not
look like work.

41:10.028 --> 41:11.460
Well, not your kind of work.

41:11.529 --> 41:13.207
This isn't about your business,
Mr. Hardwick,

41:13.231 --> 41:14.663
this is a murder investigation.

41:14.732 --> 41:16.599
Max Najjar.

41:16.667 --> 41:17.933
I believe you knew him.

41:18.002 --> 41:21.337
Does anyone really know
anyone these days?

41:21.406 --> 41:23.172
You transferred money
into his account.

41:23.241 --> 41:25.408
Well, in that sense,
I knew him, yes, yes.

41:25.476 --> 41:27.510
Max... Najjar.

41:27.578 --> 41:29.912
Yeah, h-he was in some
financial difficulty,

41:29.981 --> 41:31.781
and he needed to make
a quick sale.

41:31.849 --> 41:34.417
How did Najjar come to work
with Karim Farouk?

41:34.485 --> 41:35.818
How the hell should I know?

41:35.887 --> 41:37.753
Let me break this down for you:

41:37.822 --> 41:40.356
There's no love lost
between me and the man

41:40.425 --> 41:42.858
who held me as a slave
and tortured me for a year.

41:42.927 --> 41:44.687
Maybe you'll also understand
that my business

41:44.729 --> 41:48.597
relies on discretion,
so the only questions I ask

41:48.666 --> 41:51.600
are to establish the provenance
of a piece for sale, that's it.

41:51.669 --> 41:54.103
We will get to the bottom of
this, with or without your help.

41:54.172 --> 41:55.671
Okay. If we find out that you've

41:55.740 --> 41:59.141
been financing terrorism,
knowingly or unknowingly,

41:59.210 --> 42:01.210
you will be treated
exactly the same as them.

42:01.279 --> 42:02.645
Right, that's good to know.

42:02.713 --> 42:05.147
You should make a change to
your plans. Italy will become

42:05.216 --> 42:07.483
a very difficult place
for you to do business.

42:07.552 --> 42:09.518
More difficult than it is now?

42:09.587 --> 42:11.654
Let's go.

42:11.722 --> 42:13.355
The Brotherhood of Serapis.

42:17.662 --> 42:20.229
Does that name
mean anything to you?

42:20.298 --> 42:21.831
What about them?

42:21.899 --> 42:24.533
There are people in this world

42:24.602 --> 42:27.036
that scare me more
than Karim Farouk.

42:27.105 --> 42:29.672
I believe Max was
working for them.

42:29.740 --> 42:32.308
He tried to sell me
this medallion he was wearing.

42:32.376 --> 42:36.745
It had three intertwined
serpents etched on the front.

42:36.814 --> 42:38.747
You want to find out
what happened to Max?

42:38.816 --> 42:40.649
You want to get
to the bottom of this?

42:40.718 --> 42:42.418
I suggest you look into them.

42:42.487 --> 42:43.919
And maybe you'll do me the favor

42:43.988 --> 42:46.522
of not putting my name
on any paperwork,

42:46.591 --> 42:49.725
because if you do,
my blood'll be on your hands.

42:54.968 --> 42:57.969
<i>We should stay here until
we figure out our next move.</i>

42:58.038 --> 43:00.539
So, you are very <i>glücklich, ja?</i>

43:00.607 --> 43:02.007
Eh, lucky?

43:02.076 --> 43:04.743
Because of the football match,
we have been booked for months,

43:04.812 --> 43:06.378
but I just spoke with the owner.

43:06.447 --> 43:09.047
He has accepted to liberate
our last room.

43:09.116 --> 43:11.016
It's very, um...

43:11.085 --> 43:12.551
cozy, yeah?

43:12.619 --> 43:15.654
Wonderful. Thanks.

43:15.723 --> 43:17.689
<i>Gute Nacht.</i>

43:17.758 --> 43:19.491
Oh, it's Chuck.

43:19.560 --> 43:21.526
He got my text.

43:21.595 --> 43:23.929
"Interesting photo,
nothing jumps out,

43:23.997 --> 43:25.564
"but I can look
into it tomorrow.

43:25.632 --> 43:30.368
My gut tells me it has something
to do with Macho Grande."

43:30.437 --> 43:33.105
The man's obsessed with
this Macho Grande place.

43:33.173 --> 43:34.606
What's so great about it?

43:34.675 --> 43:37.776
Nothing. It's... Fine.

43:37.845 --> 43:40.579
Don't tell me. He will
next time I get him drunk.

43:40.647 --> 43:43.181
He's gonna check in the
Vatican archives tomorrow

43:43.250 --> 43:45.050
and let us know
if he finds anything.

43:47.087 --> 43:49.421
Cozy.

43:51.525 --> 43:55.293
It's okay. I can take the floor.

43:55.362 --> 43:58.096
So we're pretend-divorced now?

43:58.165 --> 44:00.866
Don't trust me to share the
bed, or don't trust yourself?

44:00.934 --> 44:02.868
Just trying to keep things
uncomplicated.

44:02.936 --> 44:04.903
Don't flatter yourself.

44:04.972 --> 44:06.938
I am exhausted.

44:07.007 --> 44:08.874
I only have eyes
for this pillow.

44:08.942 --> 44:11.243
Yeah? I have had such

44:11.311 --> 44:13.678
a busy day,

44:13.747 --> 44:15.614
Climbing the big castles,

44:15.682 --> 44:18.250
chasing the angry Nazis, yeah?

44:18.318 --> 44:19.584
Yeah...

44:19.653 --> 44:22.220
the accent's not
your strongest move.

44:23.323 --> 44:25.991
What?

44:26.059 --> 44:29.060
How dare you?

44:29.129 --> 44:32.998
I'm just saying, I
have a few notes. No?

44:33.066 --> 44:35.333
I was too nice, wasn't I?

44:35.402 --> 44:39.271
You like me better when I'm bad.

44:39.339 --> 44:42.908
You like you better
when you're bad.

44:48.348 --> 44:52.250
Maybe it's time we talk about
the elephant in the room.

44:54.354 --> 44:56.955
There's barely room for us
in this room.

44:57.024 --> 44:59.090
We're gonna find Farouk again.

44:59.159 --> 45:00.826
I want to make sure

45:00.894 --> 45:02.238
we're on the same page.

45:02.262 --> 45:04.296
I know you want
to take him alive,

45:04.364 --> 45:05.964
and for the sake
of getting along,

45:06.033 --> 45:08.466
I'm happy to let you believe
that you will.

45:08.535 --> 45:11.102
Killing Farouk doesn't
necessarily stop the attack,

45:11.171 --> 45:13.271
but it does keep us
from finding out his plan.

45:13.340 --> 45:16.608
And it makes damn sure
he doesn't get away again.

45:16.677 --> 45:18.109
It gets justice for my father.

45:18.178 --> 45:20.378
Revenge isn't the same thing
as justice.

45:20.447 --> 45:21.847
Justice happens
in a court of law,

45:21.915 --> 45:23.281
in front of the whole world.

45:23.350 --> 45:26.351
I don't care that the world
gets to see it.

45:26.420 --> 45:28.386
I just want to be the one
that kills him.

45:30.023 --> 45:33.358
If this is all about revenge,

45:33.427 --> 45:37.329
even if you get what you want,

45:37.397 --> 45:40.332
you're gonna be holding on
to the anger forever.

45:42.402 --> 45:45.003
Your father wouldn't
have wanted that.

45:47.641 --> 45:49.574
You're right.

45:50.777 --> 45:53.144
You should take the floor.

46:03.290 --> 46:05.056
How'd you sleep?

46:05.125 --> 46:07.158
Fine. You?

46:07.227 --> 46:08.994
Never better.

46:11.932 --> 46:13.899
Yo, Chuck? You're on speaker.

46:13.967 --> 46:15.667
That's Danny's subtle way
of telling you

46:15.736 --> 46:17.080
not to say anything
that would embarrass him.

46:17.104 --> 46:18.436
But don't hold back
on my account.

46:18.505 --> 46:20.005
Okay.

46:20.073 --> 46:24.910
Hey, uh, I sent your code to,
uh, some of my Jesuit brothers.

46:24.978 --> 46:27.545
And, uh, I think we figured out

46:27.614 --> 46:29.514
the answer.

46:29.583 --> 46:33.018
And the answer may shake
the very foundations

46:33.086 --> 46:35.186
of Western civilization.

46:35.255 --> 46:37.055
Shh!

46:38.158 --> 46:39.235
Are you guys holding in
your laughs?

46:39.259 --> 46:40.692
'Cause I can't tell
over the phone.

46:40.761 --> 46:42.861
If I say yes,
will you tell me what it is?

46:42.930 --> 46:45.730
Sheesh. You two are a delight
this morning.

46:45.799 --> 46:50.902
Well, the Kreisau code was next
to a very specific Jesuit Bible

46:50.971 --> 46:53.204
that all of these guys
would have had.

46:53.273 --> 46:55.473
This Bible was not
there accidentally.

46:55.542 --> 46:57.309
It was the key.

46:59.780 --> 47:01.746
Nothing? Really?

47:01.815 --> 47:04.049
Nic Cage? <i> National Treasure?</i>

47:04.117 --> 47:06.751
You guys are really,
uh, draining all of the fun

47:06.820 --> 47:08.787
out of this for me,
you know that, right?

47:08.855 --> 47:13.892
Anyway, this Jesuit library had
copies of the Kreisau Bible,

47:13.961 --> 47:16.094
so we went through it.

47:16.163 --> 47:19.731
Took us a couple hours,
but we figured out the code.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.400
Now, each number corresponds
to a different letter,

47:22.469 --> 47:24.235
in reference
to a specific verse.

47:24.304 --> 47:28.173
We put it all together, and...

47:28.241 --> 47:33.945
it spelled
"Sauber-Depot, garage 18."

47:35.182 --> 47:37.115
Sauber-Depot?

47:37.184 --> 47:38.650
Sounds like
an old military base.

47:38.719 --> 47:40.085
Yeah.

47:40.153 --> 47:43.254
The Internet said that it's,
uh, an old, uh,

47:43.323 --> 47:46.358
an old Panzer repair depot
from the war.

47:46.426 --> 47:51.129
And Maps says that it's
not that far from your castle.

47:51.198 --> 47:53.765
Why would they take
Cleopatra to an army base?

47:53.834 --> 47:57.168
Well, there's not many more
secure places in the '40s

47:57.237 --> 47:59.471
than a German military base.

47:59.539 --> 48:01.373
Hey, thanks, Chuck.

48:01.441 --> 48:03.775
Hey, no problem. You know what?
We'll call it even

48:03.844 --> 48:05.443
if you can pick me up
some of those, uh,

48:05.512 --> 48:07.445
those apple pancakes they got...

48:07.514 --> 48:10.281
My God, is he a chatty one.

48:10.350 --> 48:14.352
Look, about last night...

48:14.421 --> 48:17.989
what happened or didn't...
Don't.

48:18.058 --> 48:19.657
Don't. You're you, I'm me.

48:19.726 --> 48:22.894
It's best if we accept it.

48:22.963 --> 48:25.397
Yeah.

48:25.465 --> 48:29.334
Come on. Let's go.

48:29.403 --> 48:31.803
We're actually ahead
of Farouk for once.

48:48.922 --> 48:51.723
Garage 18.

48:52.793 --> 48:54.159
Not exactly where you'd expect

48:54.227 --> 48:55.994
to find the last queen of Egypt.

48:56.063 --> 48:58.063
Maybe that's why no one has.

49:01.168 --> 49:04.335
If Cleopatra was here,
I'm guessing

49:04.404 --> 49:06.571
she wasn't here for long.

49:06.640 --> 49:09.441
These walls make no sense here.

49:09.509 --> 49:11.743
They block the whole bay

49:11.812 --> 49:14.412
and serve no structural purpose.

49:23.990 --> 49:25.290
Something behind this wall.

49:25.358 --> 49:27.292
Yeah?

49:29.362 --> 49:31.296
After you.

49:47.714 --> 49:49.414
It's a freight elevator.

49:49.483 --> 49:50.715
To where, I wonder.

49:52.152 --> 49:54.552
The Germans hid their treasure

49:54.621 --> 49:55.887
in underground vaults

49:55.956 --> 49:57.922
to protect them
from bombardment.

49:57.991 --> 49:59.791
So if they were
in enough of a hurry,

49:59.860 --> 50:01.493
they could've left Cleopatra

50:01.561 --> 50:03.294
down there.

50:03.363 --> 50:04.662
Let's find out.

50:24.926 --> 50:26.526
We'd better be careful.

50:26.595 --> 50:27.595
Yeah.

50:31.800 --> 50:33.733
Yeah.

50:42.577 --> 50:45.678
Oh, God!

50:45.747 --> 50:47.947
Yeah.

50:48.016 --> 50:49.516
Whoa.

50:53.955 --> 50:55.355
Wow.

50:55.423 --> 50:58.791
The good news is we're rich.

51:03.765 --> 51:05.465
This was melted down

51:05.534 --> 51:07.800
from the jewelry of the people
they sent to the camps.

51:07.869 --> 51:10.036
Oh.

51:13.308 --> 51:15.241
Wow.

51:15.310 --> 51:16.643
Lexi.

51:16.711 --> 51:19.579
Cleopatra was here.

51:21.683 --> 51:24.584
In the photo, this was the top
of her sarcophagus.

51:24.653 --> 51:26.886
Must have been hard
to travel with.

51:26.955 --> 51:28.321
In the rush to get out,

51:28.390 --> 51:31.324
they just pried it off
and left it.

51:32.394 --> 51:33.726
I can't believe this.

51:33.795 --> 51:35.428
Least we're getting closer.

51:35.497 --> 51:37.730
Closer? To what?

51:37.799 --> 51:39.232
Cleopatra?

51:39.301 --> 51:40.733
Farouk?

51:40.802 --> 51:42.602
What a waste.

51:42.671 --> 51:44.604
"Close" is just another word
for "nothing."

51:58.887 --> 52:01.187
You been looking for me?

52:05.060 --> 52:06.626
Who are you?

52:06.695 --> 52:08.261
One of them?

52:08.330 --> 52:10.096
One of who?

52:10.165 --> 52:11.497
Serapis.

52:11.566 --> 52:13.499
They call themselves
The Brotherhood.

52:13.568 --> 52:15.368
Does it look like
I'm one of them?

52:15.437 --> 52:17.370
Turn around.

52:17.439 --> 52:19.939
I said turn around.

52:34.456 --> 52:36.656
So, who are you?

52:38.727 --> 52:40.059
I won't ask again.

52:41.196 --> 52:43.796
Lexi Vaziri.

52:43.865 --> 52:45.465
Vaziri.

52:47.068 --> 52:49.135
Reza Vaziri's daughter.

52:49.237 --> 52:51.337
A greedy little girl
who shed her skin

52:51.406 --> 52:53.039
like a snake
to become a Westerner.

52:53.108 --> 52:54.741
Who betrayed her own people,

52:54.809 --> 52:56.209
got her father killed.

52:56.277 --> 52:57.844
I betrayed my own people?

52:57.912 --> 53:00.346
You killed hundreds of our
people, bombed the pyramids.

53:00.415 --> 53:01.859
The pyramids are nothing
but an attraction

53:01.883 --> 53:03.082
to Western tourists.

53:04.219 --> 53:07.153
A symbol of a conquered people.

53:09.224 --> 53:11.991
You didn't find Cleopatra there.

53:12.060 --> 53:14.761
You won't find her here, either.

53:16.898 --> 53:19.365
You tell me where she went,

53:19.434 --> 53:22.502
or this place becomes your tomb.

53:22.570 --> 53:25.071
I'll never tell you anything.

53:26.508 --> 53:29.442
Two men are coming.

53:29.511 --> 53:31.744
Have it your way.

53:48.129 --> 53:50.897
Thanks. We're trapped.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.534
Well, we might be able
to make it out.

53:55.837 --> 53:56.903
Up there.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.640
Right.

54:00.709 --> 54:02.742
You know, in case
this doesn't go well,

54:02.811 --> 54:06.045
I think we should talk about...
No, no, no. We are not having

54:06.114 --> 54:07.258
an "in case this doesn't
go well" conversation.

54:07.282 --> 54:08.381
Okay, but if it doesn't...

54:08.450 --> 54:09.916
We're gonna be fine.

54:09.984 --> 54:11.551
Look, when Chuck
and I were kids,

54:11.619 --> 54:13.319
we used to love
the <i> Airplane!</i> movies.

54:13.388 --> 54:14.587
Huh?

54:14.656 --> 54:16.823
Seriously? <i> Airplane!?</i>

54:16.891 --> 54:18.558
"Don't call me Shirley."

54:18.626 --> 54:21.060
Why are you telling me this?
In the movie,

54:21.129 --> 54:24.630
Macho Grande is that thing
you can't get over.

54:24.699 --> 54:27.500
Thing you hold on to even
when you should let it go.

54:32.340 --> 54:35.174
Chuck thinks
you're my Macho Grande.

54:35.243 --> 54:37.510
So, is Chuck right?

54:37.579 --> 54:40.246
Am I your Macho Grande?

54:43.485 --> 54:44.617
Danny.

54:44.686 --> 54:46.252
Danny!

54:47.655 --> 54:49.655
Danny! Hold on.

54:49.724 --> 54:51.157
Come on.

54:53.361 --> 54:55.361
Lexi!

54:56.498 --> 54:58.931
Oh, boy.

55:13.615 --> 55:16.549
Uh... little help?!

55:18.086 --> 55:20.453
Help!

55:21.305 --> 55:27.776
