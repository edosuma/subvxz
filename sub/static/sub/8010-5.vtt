WEBVTT

00:01.455 --> 00:03.641
Lee! Hey.

00:03.724 --> 00:05.056
How you doing?

00:05.058 --> 00:05.976
I'm all right.

00:06.029 --> 00:07.137
Brought you your favorite.

00:07.230 --> 00:08.496
Cup of coffee
with a dash of Codeine?

00:08.588 --> 00:09.485
- All right.
- Yep,

00:09.551 --> 00:11.834
one "nap-puccino"
foaming at the mouth.

00:11.887 --> 00:14.166
So how's the
angeling going, huh?

00:14.168 --> 00:17.035
Ah, my human is
the easiest gig in town.

00:17.037 --> 00:19.137
She eats right,
puts family before work,

00:19.139 --> 00:21.940
and that body is fun
to watch over.

00:21.942 --> 00:23.775
So what's on your agenda
for today, huh?

00:23.777 --> 00:26.011
Nothing much,
just watching over Tricia,

00:26.013 --> 00:27.846
making sure that old tree branch

00:27.848 --> 00:29.280
that she insists
on doing yoga under

00:29.282 --> 00:33.084
doesn't fall
on her beautiful tight body.

00:33.086 --> 00:35.053
Getting a little
pervy there, Lee.

00:35.055 --> 00:37.522
And that's
coming from me.

00:37.524 --> 00:38.823
How about you?

00:38.825 --> 00:40.158
Oh, I got big things happening.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.127
I've almost got Allison
to the point

00:42.129 --> 00:44.028
where she feels comfortable
being single.

00:44.030 --> 00:45.063
- Really?!
- Mm-hmm.

00:45.065 --> 00:46.331
Oh, that's huge.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.665
Your girl is such
a serial monogamist.

00:47.667 --> 00:48.900
I know, right?

00:48.902 --> 00:50.335
And she has one
final test today.

00:50.337 --> 00:52.904
She has to RSVP that
she's going alone

00:52.906 --> 00:54.339
to a friend's engagement party.

00:54.341 --> 00:55.840
But after that, man,
we're in the clear.

00:55.842 --> 00:57.208
Well, that's great.

00:57.210 --> 00:58.676
And then you can focus
on all her other issues.

00:58.678 --> 01:00.011
Oh, you got that right.

01:00.013 --> 01:02.413
Next up, a little lesson
I like to call

01:02.415 --> 01:03.915
"€œbeing okay looking stupid."

01:03.917 --> 01:06.884
Well, well, that's right
in your wheelhouse, huh?

01:06.886 --> 01:09.587
- How are you gonna do it?
- Taking her roller-skating.

01:09.589 --> 01:11.989
Hmm, sounds like you just want
to go roller-skating.

01:11.991 --> 01:14.325
I do love roller-skating.

01:14.327 --> 01:17.328
Look, I hate getting
all up in your halo,

01:17.330 --> 01:19.163
but you're breaking protocol
left and right.

01:19.165 --> 01:21.165
You're the one who taught me
the angel rules

01:21.167 --> 01:22.500
right here at this picnic table.

01:22.502 --> 01:24.001
- I know what I'm doing.
- Do ya?

01:24.003 --> 01:26.404
First you tell her that
you're a guardian angel.

01:26.406 --> 01:28.005
Then you move
into her guesthouse.

01:28.007 --> 01:29.940
Which is unbelievable.

01:29.942 --> 01:31.609
I keep meaning to have you over.

01:31.611 --> 01:33.110
I could really use a shower.

01:33.112 --> 01:34.412
You know, the government
can't hear you in the shower.

01:34.414 --> 01:36.514
They're not listening
to you, Lee.

01:36.516 --> 01:38.549
Let's just keep
it on angel talk,

01:38.551 --> 01:40.284
'cause you sound crazy.

01:40.286 --> 01:42.286
I'm just saying, if you
keep getting involved

01:42.288 --> 01:45.356
in your human's life,
it's gonna blow up in your face.

01:45.358 --> 01:47.157
Don't angel an angel, rookie.

01:47.159 --> 01:48.459
Okay, I just thought

01:48.461 --> 01:49.994
we were supposed
to stay in the background,

01:49.996 --> 01:52.229
Mm. guiding, observing...

01:52.231 --> 01:53.731
Oh, my God,
they're doing partner work.

01:53.733 --> 01:55.733
Keep it professional, man.

01:55.735 --> 01:56.867
I am.

01:56.869 --> 01:58.469
I'm just appreci... ating.

01:58.471 --> 01:59.503
Hi.

01:59.505 --> 02:00.938
Hi.

02:00.940 --> 02:02.306
I hate to be presumptuous,

02:02.308 --> 02:04.641
but I thought
you guys might be hungry.

02:04.643 --> 02:05.676
Always.

02:05.678 --> 02:07.411
Thank you for presuming.

02:07.413 --> 02:08.912
Sure.

02:08.913 --> 02:10.747
This is a good park for bagels.

02:10.749 --> 02:12.049
Yeah.

02:12.051 --> 02:13.050
I got a snow cone yesterday.

02:13.052 --> 02:14.051
No kidding.

02:14.053 --> 02:15.552
Yeah. Cherry.

02:15.554 --> 02:17.321
All right, Kelly.

02:17.323 --> 02:20.724
So the engagement party is
going to have a Mardi Gras vibe

02:20.726 --> 02:22.559
because that's
where you met Hank.

02:22.561 --> 02:24.127
Yeah, that was
such a good night.

02:24.129 --> 02:25.462
I wish I could remember it.

02:25.464 --> 02:27.230
Okay, I got a food
truck serving gumbo,

02:27.232 --> 02:28.665
I've got a king cake,

02:28.667 --> 02:30.400
I have three different
flavors of yard margs,

02:30.402 --> 02:31.802
and I'm thinking drink tickets...
That would be cute, right?

02:31.804 --> 02:33.837
Oh, good, those will
help slow my mom down.

02:33.839 --> 02:34.805
I want her to behave.

02:34.807 --> 02:36.540
I'll behave.

02:36.542 --> 02:39.543
I'll "behaving" a lot of drinks.
Watch out for this one.

02:39.545 --> 02:41.945
Linda, no problem getting
the speaker wires

02:41.947 --> 02:43.180
through the ceiling...
Brad and I are making sure

02:43.182 --> 02:44.881
you get music for your party.

02:44.883 --> 02:45.629
Thanks, Dad.

02:45.669 --> 02:48.251
Ah, the Fuller men
are back on the job.

02:48.253 --> 02:49.319
By the way,

02:49.321 --> 02:50.654
I have a "check engine" light

02:50.656 --> 02:51.955
that would love your attention.

02:51.957 --> 02:53.556
Oh, I'd be happy to pop the hood

02:53.558 --> 02:55.392
and then secretly
call my mechanic.

02:55.394 --> 02:58.028
- Hey, there's Kelly.
- This must be Amy.

02:58.030 --> 03:01.858
Bride-to-be having her big
party in my front yard.

03:01.897 --> 03:03.266
It's actually my backyard.

03:03.268 --> 03:04.734
So how's the guest list coming?

03:04.736 --> 03:05.835
Are we all firm?

03:05.837 --> 03:06.836
Uh, yeah.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.238
Actually, everyone has RSVP'd,

03:08.240 --> 03:09.205
except for Allison.

03:09.207 --> 03:10.206
Ah.

03:10.208 --> 03:11.674
I did not know that.

03:11.676 --> 03:13.543
Does the host have to RSVP?

03:13.545 --> 03:15.545
I mean, I know that you are
going to be there,

03:15.547 --> 03:17.780
- but are you bringing a date?
- Yes, are you bringing a date?

03:17.782 --> 03:19.649
Well, I've been
thinking about that.

03:19.651 --> 03:21.985
- And?
- And?

03:21.987 --> 03:24.354
Is she a translator for you
that just speaks louder?

03:24.356 --> 03:26.522
- Kelly, I'm building drama.
- I'm gonna go alone.

03:26.524 --> 03:28.625
Good news.

03:28.627 --> 03:30.860
She seems very invested
in you going solo.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.061
Well, it's what good friends do.

03:32.063 --> 03:33.096
They.

03:33.098 --> 03:34.163
You should try it sometime.

03:34.165 --> 03:36.599
- Wahoo.
- No, it's just "whoo".

03:36.601 --> 03:38.434
- Whoo-whoo.
- No.

03:38.436 --> 03:40.970
- I feel like it needs a little bit more...
- It needs nothing.

03:40.972 --> 03:42.972
Guys, look, I realize I just
got out of a relationship,

03:42.974 --> 03:45.474
and I feel like I just need
a little time on my own.

03:47.011 --> 03:49.345
Allison's single
and not ready to mingle.

03:49.347 --> 03:51.347
Except with her best
friend, Amy.

03:51.349 --> 03:53.649
I'm sorry, were you
saving this for something?

03:53.651 --> 03:54.684
The engagement party.

03:54.686 --> 03:56.452
Oh, goodness gracious.

03:56.454 --> 03:58.654
Well, I don't see the cork,
so I will plug it up

03:58.656 --> 04:00.656
with a...

04:00.658 --> 04:02.692
Carrot cool?

04:04.094 --> 04:05.782
S01E05
Soulmates

04:05.848 --> 04:08.197
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

04:09.846 --> 04:12.369
- Oh, this is fun, right?
- Totally.

04:12.435 --> 04:14.796
I feel like we escaped
a '90s gum commercial.

04:14.915 --> 04:15.984
Here's our table.

04:15.986 --> 04:18.807
I love that you just don't care
how stupid you look.

04:18.855 --> 04:20.688
The only person here
looking stupid

04:20.690 --> 04:22.123
is the one not wearing pads.

04:22.125 --> 04:23.658
Ah, yes.

04:23.660 --> 04:25.660
You know what's great about
this time on your own

04:25.662 --> 04:27.195
is you're really gonna
free yourself up

04:27.197 --> 04:28.563
to work on your issues.

04:28.565 --> 04:30.364
You're gonna learn so
many great lessons.

04:30.366 --> 04:31.866
Not everything has
to be a lesson.

04:31.868 --> 04:33.634
And that's one of the lessons.

04:33.636 --> 04:36.537
You're not as dumb
as you look in that helmet.

04:36.539 --> 04:38.339
Uh, maybe keep it on.

04:38.341 --> 04:40.074
No, you know what, I don't care.

04:40.076 --> 04:41.742
I'm not trying
to impress anybody.

04:41.744 --> 04:44.745
I am loving single fun Allison.

04:44.747 --> 04:46.347
But maybe you have a scrunchie?

04:47.549 --> 04:48.883
Ooh, what's going on there?

04:48.885 --> 04:50.317
Pillow fight!

04:50.319 --> 04:53.354
- Let's go.
- Well, that sounds spontaneous,

04:53.356 --> 04:55.256
and spontaneity is a lesson
I've been working on for months.

04:55.258 --> 04:57.324
Let's go knock
those ironic mustaches

04:57.326 --> 04:59.760
off those millennial faces.

04:59.762 --> 05:00.928
You got wire cutter?

05:00.930 --> 05:02.062
Mm-hmm, coming in hot.

05:02.064 --> 05:03.597
- Flashlight.
- Flipping.

05:03.599 --> 05:04.999
Hey, one more now.

05:05.001 --> 05:06.400
Look out.

05:06.402 --> 05:08.002
Fuller men, back at it.

05:08.004 --> 05:09.737
What was the last
project we did?

05:09.739 --> 05:12.373
We did the re-mod on the p-deck
outside Aunty J's c-do.

05:12.375 --> 05:13.841
Yeah, that's too
many abbreviations.

05:13.843 --> 05:15.275
Yeah, sorry, it was
the remodel on the pool deck

05:15.277 --> 05:17.244
- at Aunt Jenny's condominium.
- Yeah.

05:17.246 --> 05:18.846
Finally something in that
woman's life that was stable.

05:18.848 --> 05:19.880
What?

05:19.882 --> 05:21.424
You're bad.

05:22.084 --> 05:24.585
Whoa, what do we have here?

05:24.587 --> 05:27.020
Is this Brad's first toolbox?

05:27.022 --> 05:29.289
Uh, Dad, don't touch that.

05:29.291 --> 05:30.457
Okay, now I'm sensing
there's a reason

05:30.459 --> 05:31.758
you don't want me to open this.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.094
Uh, no, I d... I...
No, I just want you

05:34.096 --> 05:36.196
to help me with this ladder
so it doesn't hit your car.

05:36.198 --> 05:37.231
What, do you got nunchucks?

05:37.233 --> 05:39.199
Maybe some cherry bombs?

05:39.201 --> 05:41.034
Oh, nudie magazines.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.469
Dad, do not open that.

05:42.471 --> 05:44.838
Relax, it's not
the first time I've seen

05:44.840 --> 05:46.206
a fella's private stash
of paper flowers.

05:46.208 --> 05:48.742
Uh. I got it.

05:48.744 --> 05:50.644
You pull back one
of the petals to reveal

05:50.646 --> 05:52.579
that these are actually made
out of Playboy magazines.

05:52.581 --> 05:54.147
No, no, it's just
a paper flower.

05:54.149 --> 05:56.249
I made them sophomore year
in art class.

05:56.251 --> 05:57.384
Relax.

05:57.386 --> 05:59.286
Just wasn't what
I was expecting.

05:59.288 --> 06:01.321
I have tons of porn, Dad...
It's hidden up in the attic.

06:01.323 --> 06:04.257
- That's okay, I really don't...
- I can take you up there right now.

06:04.259 --> 06:05.325
I will, and it's
not just Playboy,

06:05.327 --> 06:06.459
it's like the real... here.

06:06.461 --> 06:07.861
Take this, I'm getting the porn.

06:11.934 --> 06:13.333
Oh.

06:13.335 --> 06:15.335
Hey, you take the guy
in the wool scarf.

06:15.337 --> 06:16.936
I'll take the guy
in the wool hat.

06:16.938 --> 06:18.505
It's 80 degrees, people!

06:25.446 --> 06:27.714
No!

06:29.000 --> 06:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:42.863 --> 06:44.397
Ow! Why does that hurt so much?

06:44.399 --> 06:46.265
Because it's Memory Foam,

06:46.267 --> 06:49.869
so you don't... ever... forget!

06:54.174 --> 06:56.609
Oh. Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

06:56.611 --> 06:58.044
That's all right,
that's all right.

06:58.046 --> 07:00.546
All part of a pillow fight!

07:01.882 --> 07:03.182
Yeah, I need my glasses.

07:03.184 --> 07:05.284
Yeah, uh... there they are.

07:08.556 --> 07:09.522
Hey.

07:09.969 --> 07:11.249
Hey.

07:14.613 --> 07:15.461
Five-O.

07:15.463 --> 07:16.629
That's not how I talk.

07:16.631 --> 07:17.897
The police are here.

07:17.899 --> 07:19.332
Well, let's bounce.
Also not how I talk.

07:19.334 --> 07:20.466
Let's just walk quickly
in this direction.

07:22.970 --> 07:24.303
Allison!

07:24.305 --> 07:25.738
Oh, my God, I lost my human.

07:25.740 --> 07:28.307
Or my friend,
as people would say.

07:28.309 --> 07:30.276
Uh-oh, I got priors.

07:30.278 --> 07:32.077
Uh, good afternoon, officers.

07:32.079 --> 07:34.513
Uh, Detective Amy Cass,
this is my crime scene now.

07:34.515 --> 07:37.783
I'm gonna need 30 feet,
a cup of coffee, black, now!

07:41.054 --> 07:42.855
Dad, hit me with the level.

07:45.287 --> 07:47.293
Okay, you seem distracted.

07:47.295 --> 07:49.428
You're still thinking about
the flowers, aren't you?

07:49.430 --> 07:50.796
Your unexplained secret garden?

07:50.798 --> 07:52.631
No. Little bit. Constantly.

07:52.633 --> 07:53.699
What was up with that?

07:53.701 --> 07:55.100
You remember Mr. Gene,

07:55.102 --> 07:56.468
my high school
art teacher, right?

07:56.470 --> 07:57.836
I'm just gonna say sure.

07:57.838 --> 07:59.238
I was an angry kid.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.673
And Mr. Gene taught me
how to express my feelings

08:01.675 --> 08:02.808
through the paper arts.

08:02.810 --> 08:04.143
You wrestled in high school.

08:04.145 --> 08:06.178
Those two aren't
mutually exclusive, Dad.

08:06.180 --> 08:08.614
I have a rich emotional IQ.

08:08.616 --> 08:10.415
According to one BuzzFeed quiz,

08:10.417 --> 08:12.517
I can feel at the level of
an 18th-century Italian painter.

08:12.519 --> 08:15.420
I so want to mock you, but
I also want you to feel

08:15.422 --> 08:17.189
like you can come to me with this stuff.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.226
- Where's Allison?
- I thought she was with you.

08:21.228 --> 08:23.528
We were at the park,
and then she ran away from me.

08:23.530 --> 08:25.697
Seems like dangerously
logical behavior.

08:25.699 --> 08:28.166
Marv, there is a time
for our hysterical banter.

08:28.168 --> 08:30.001
It is not now.

08:30.003 --> 08:32.871
Oh, you guys, this is bad.

08:32.873 --> 08:34.773
I checked all the usual places.

08:34.775 --> 08:37.241
The coffee shop, the office,
the container store,

08:37.244 --> 08:39.678
her spin class,
her backup spin class.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.011
Look at you, Mrs. Columbo.

08:43.448 --> 08:45.183
Hello, surprising number
of people in my house.

08:45.185 --> 08:46.217
Hey.

08:48.455 --> 08:49.754
Marv, move!

08:49.756 --> 08:52.057
God, you're not getting it!

08:52.059 --> 08:54.459
Well, I'm glad you're back,
but next time,

08:54.461 --> 08:56.861
give me an advanced warning
if you're gonna be spontaneous.

08:56.863 --> 08:58.329
What happened in the park?

08:58.331 --> 09:00.765
Well, I was looking for you
when the cops came,

09:00.767 --> 09:02.167
but I couldn't find you,

09:02.169 --> 09:04.002
so this guy I was talking to
gave me a ride home.

09:04.004 --> 09:05.970
A guy? We're not
slipping, are we?

09:05.972 --> 09:08.506
Because you just dedicated
yourself to be on your own,

09:08.508 --> 09:10.074
to work on your issues.

09:10.076 --> 09:11.042
Never said that.

09:11.044 --> 09:12.076
And relax.

09:12.078 --> 09:13.278
I'm not falling in love.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.379
Darren and I are
just having coffee.

09:14.381 --> 09:15.580
Wait, Darren?

09:15.582 --> 09:16.614
What's Darren's last name?

09:16.616 --> 09:18.216
Jensen, I think.

09:18.218 --> 09:20.218
Darren Jensen, oh, my God.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.420
This is a disaster.

09:22.422 --> 09:24.655
- Why?
- I screwed up huge.

09:24.657 --> 09:26.591
I mean, it's bad enough
that I lost track of you.

09:26.593 --> 09:28.893
Just say the crazy thought
so I can go to bed.

09:28.895 --> 09:31.729
Darren Jensen is your soulmate.

09:31.731 --> 09:32.897
There's the Nutter Butter.

09:32.899 --> 09:34.232
And you weren't
supposed to meet him

09:34.234 --> 09:35.233
for another year.

09:35.235 --> 09:36.868
Oh, double-stuffed.

09:39.944 --> 09:41.845
Oh, I can't believe I let
you meet your soulmate.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.909
Ah, damn it, Amy!

09:44.049 --> 09:45.315
This is Angeling 101.

09:45.317 --> 09:47.283
Okay, calm down. Look, even
if Darren were my soulma...

09:47.285 --> 09:48.818
There is no "if"

09:48.820 --> 09:50.353
Would you like to
see the paperwork?

09:50.355 --> 09:52.488
- Yes.
- Well, sadly it was destroyed

09:52.490 --> 09:55.191
in a cigarillo fire
in the guesthouse.

09:55.193 --> 09:56.692
Love to get a smoke
detector back there.

09:56.694 --> 09:57.660
It was a close call.

09:57.662 --> 09:59.195
Amy, as a friend,

09:59.197 --> 10:00.730
wouldn't you be happy for me
if I met the perfect guy?

10:00.732 --> 10:02.648
No, you have a mountain
of issues to work on

10:02.733 --> 10:04.800
before you can get in
another relationship.

10:04.802 --> 10:06.902
You're not even ready
to date a regular guy,

10:06.904 --> 10:08.637
much less your soulmate.

10:08.639 --> 10:10.739
"€œMountain of issues"?
What are you talking about?

10:10.741 --> 10:12.741
Well, for one, you
overreact to criticism.

10:12.743 --> 10:14.677
Also you don't
know how to relax.

10:14.679 --> 10:17.179
- You have sneezing bitch face.
- What?

10:17.181 --> 10:18.580
And most importantly

10:18.582 --> 10:20.115
for the health of your
future relationships,

10:20.117 --> 10:22.584
you have unresolved
trust issues.

10:22.586 --> 10:25.587
Oh, I get it, you're worried
if I start dating somebody,

10:25.589 --> 10:27.256
you're gonna lose
your skating buddy.

10:27.258 --> 10:29.691
Oh, please, I have plenty
of skating buddies.

10:29.693 --> 10:32.094
I have CJ, Rocket and the rest
of the Beverly Hills Blitz Crew.

10:32.096 --> 10:33.095
Okay.

10:33.097 --> 10:34.696
It is just coffee, all right?

10:34.698 --> 10:37.316
I promise you we will still
be able to hang out.

10:38.568 --> 10:40.102
You know what?

10:40.104 --> 10:41.870
I hear you.

10:41.872 --> 10:44.139
That doesn't seem like you.

10:44.141 --> 10:46.708
You go out on your date

10:46.710 --> 10:49.111
and I will give you your space.

10:49.113 --> 10:50.379
Okay.

10:50.381 --> 10:51.880
All right, I'll see you soon.

10:51.882 --> 10:53.415
- Have fun, okay?
- Okay.

10:53.417 --> 10:55.617
- All right, kid.
- Okay.

10:58.688 --> 11:00.755
Okay, I thought
I was the only person

11:00.757 --> 11:03.125
over the age of eight who liked
bubblegum ice cream.

11:03.127 --> 11:04.726
Nope. Name's Darren, I'm 32
and I love it.

11:04.728 --> 11:06.061
Okay, my turn.

11:06.063 --> 11:07.629
Uh, what's your favorite movie?

11:07.631 --> 11:09.631
- Swingers.
- Oh, my God! I love that movie.

11:09.633 --> 11:11.132
Okay, no.
Now you're gonna tell me

11:11.134 --> 11:13.034
it inspired you to take
swing dancing classes, too?

11:13.036 --> 11:14.502
It totally did.

11:14.504 --> 11:15.837
And I may have worn a zoot suit

11:15.839 --> 11:17.272
to my secondary school jubilee.

11:17.274 --> 11:18.907
- That's the Aussie prom.
- What?

11:18.909 --> 11:21.242
No way. Oh, come on.

11:21.244 --> 11:23.118
This is so random.
What a small world.

11:23.170 --> 11:23.945
Oh, my God.

11:23.947 --> 11:25.847
- Amy, what a surprise.
- I know!

11:25.849 --> 11:28.216
I was just having
a one-on-none picnic

11:28.218 --> 11:29.417
behind this tree...

11:29.419 --> 11:31.119
and you guys just walked up!

11:31.121 --> 11:32.754
Darren Jensen.

11:32.756 --> 11:34.088
First you're
at the pillow fight,

11:34.090 --> 11:35.557
now you're at the park...

11:35.559 --> 11:37.325
Does this guy have a job?

11:37.327 --> 11:39.260
Ah, I'm just
bustin' your acorns.

11:39.262 --> 11:40.495
How do you know my name?

11:40.497 --> 11:41.729
This is Amy.

11:41.731 --> 11:43.565
She lives in my back house.

11:43.567 --> 11:46.067
Listen, I made way too
much pâté for one person.

11:46.069 --> 11:47.535
And what goes better
with hot coffee

11:47.537 --> 11:49.437
than half a pound of pâté?

11:49.439 --> 11:51.572
- I think we're good on the goose liver.
- Yeah, not my favorite.

11:51.574 --> 11:52.407
Come on. Open up.

11:52.409 --> 11:53.408
- Uh...
- Really?

11:53.410 --> 11:54.308
- Nah, nah.
- Aw, come on.

11:54.310 --> 11:55.343
Amy!

11:55.345 --> 11:56.744
What are you doing here,

11:56.746 --> 11:59.147
so close to, uh, mmm!

11:59.149 --> 12:01.449
Allison, Darren, this is Lee.

12:01.451 --> 12:03.017
He works in the, uh,
business industry.

12:03.019 --> 12:04.352
That seems legit.

12:04.354 --> 12:05.620
Wait, are you two on a date?

12:05.622 --> 12:07.021
Sort of.

12:07.023 --> 12:08.189
Yeah, uh, coffee.

12:08.191 --> 12:10.424
Oh. Amy, sidecar?

12:10.426 --> 12:11.659
Sidecar. Oh.

12:11.661 --> 12:13.160
It's a business industry term.

12:20.168 --> 12:21.936
- What's in that pâté?
- Nothing!

12:21.938 --> 12:23.337
Nothing but goose
liver and codeine.

12:23.339 --> 12:25.339
Codeine? What, you trying
to knock them out?

12:25.341 --> 12:27.675
Hm. Yeah. That's codeine.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.077
Just double-confirming.

12:30.079 --> 12:31.979
He's her soulmate, Lee.

12:31.981 --> 12:33.514
What? Allison's not
ready for that.

12:33.516 --> 12:35.149
She's still emotionally
incapacitated

12:35.151 --> 12:36.383
from her last relationship.

12:36.385 --> 12:37.618
I know, Lee.
That's why I have to

12:37.620 --> 12:38.853
break them up before they kiss.

12:38.855 --> 12:40.254
Because once they do that,

12:40.256 --> 12:41.789
they're on the
relationship train,

12:41.791 --> 12:43.123
and instead of this thing
lasting a lifetime,

12:43.125 --> 12:44.658
it blows up in six months.

12:44.660 --> 12:45.659
And that's all in the paperwork?

12:45.661 --> 12:46.894
Because I'd like to see that.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.796
Well, sadly,
there was a fire, Lee.

12:48.798 --> 12:50.230
Now get out of my way!

12:52.434 --> 12:54.835
They're gone! Ooh, they
probably went off to smooch!

12:54.837 --> 12:57.404
I gotta stop that smooch!

13:02.085 --> 13:03.811
So...

13:03.813 --> 13:05.679
how 'bout that game last night?

13:05.681 --> 13:07.214
Real nail-biter.

13:07.216 --> 13:08.682
We won by 44 points.

13:08.684 --> 13:10.717
But the beginning parts of it

13:10.719 --> 13:12.119
is what I'm talking about.

13:12.121 --> 13:13.987
That was kind of
touch-and-go there for a...

13:13.989 --> 13:15.656
Hey, could we not do this?

13:15.658 --> 13:18.125
Obviously, you've opened up
a can of worms,

13:18.127 --> 13:19.660
'cause you don't think
I'm emotional.

13:19.662 --> 13:20.894
Okay.

13:20.896 --> 13:22.162
Cool.

13:22.164 --> 13:23.630
Do you... let's,
let's go deeper.

13:23.632 --> 13:24.865
Okay. Cool.

13:24.867 --> 13:26.099
Okay, cool.

13:26.101 --> 13:27.801
Uh...

13:27.803 --> 13:30.404
let's do... should I start this,

13:30.406 --> 13:31.838
- or do you want to...
- Saw a butterfly today.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.073
That is nice.

13:33.075 --> 13:35.375
It was... pretty.

13:35.377 --> 13:36.510
They are pretty.

13:36.512 --> 13:37.844
And it was alone,

13:37.846 --> 13:39.946
which reminded me
how alone I feel.

13:39.948 --> 13:41.381
Dad, that's so... I'm so sorry.

13:41.383 --> 13:43.650
- That's got to be hard for you.
- Maybe...

13:43.652 --> 13:46.219
I'm helping out with
this stupid engagement party

13:46.221 --> 13:47.921
because I want to...

13:47.923 --> 13:50.290
spend time with... Linda.

13:50.292 --> 13:52.892
Who's pretty, like a butterfly.

13:52.894 --> 13:54.627
How would it make you feel

13:54.629 --> 13:56.129
if I were to ask her out?

13:56.131 --> 13:57.564
I think it's great

13:57.566 --> 13:59.432
that you're opening up to me

13:59.434 --> 14:02.102
about disgracing Mom's memory.

14:09.862 --> 14:10.810
So, I'm standing there

14:10.812 --> 14:12.843
over the little white
pentagon on the ground...

14:12.896 --> 14:14.247
Home plate.

14:14.334 --> 14:15.231
And, uh, I got my swinging stick in
my hand...

14:15.336 --> 14:16.683
That looks very natural.

14:16.685 --> 14:17.854
And the dude on the little
hill over there...

14:17.933 --> 14:18.422
The pitcher?

14:18.486 --> 14:20.586
Lobs the oversized cricket ball.

14:20.588 --> 14:21.821
Never guess what happens next.

14:21.823 --> 14:23.523
The Aussie struck out?

14:23.525 --> 14:25.158
Bat flew right out of my hand,
almost hit a kid.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.592
Everyone was very pissed off.

14:26.594 --> 14:27.927
That's okay.

14:27.929 --> 14:29.829
Just keep brutalizing
our sports terms.

14:29.831 --> 14:31.551
I love your accent.

14:32.514 --> 14:34.000
You know, I wasn't
supposed to be here

14:34.002 --> 14:35.434
for, like, another year,

14:35.436 --> 14:37.470
but I'm really glad
my company pushed it up,

14:37.472 --> 14:38.771
'cause here we are.

14:38.773 --> 14:39.972
And, uh...

14:39.974 --> 14:41.507
sort of feels like fate, or...

14:41.509 --> 14:43.342
Wow, that's...
that's a cheesy line.

14:43.344 --> 14:44.844
I'm sorry.

14:44.846 --> 14:47.013
Um, I'd like another
at-swing, please.

14:47.015 --> 14:48.781
The term is "at bat."

14:48.783 --> 14:50.116
Oh.

15:01.807 --> 15:02.928
I told you.

15:02.930 --> 15:04.330
You got involved and
it blew up in your face.

15:04.332 --> 15:05.531
Oh, you're right.

15:05.533 --> 15:07.366
I guess the rookie

15:07.368 --> 15:09.034
taught the veteran something.

15:09.036 --> 15:10.936
Lee? Lee?

15:10.938 --> 15:12.605
I'm good.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.640
Just taking
an open-eyed grass nap.

15:14.642 --> 15:15.841
Mmm.

15:15.843 --> 15:18.143
That pâté put me
in a good place.

15:20.047 --> 15:22.047
Ooh...

15:28.970 --> 15:30.522
I'm gonna restock on my beads.

15:30.524 --> 15:32.324
Okay.

15:32.326 --> 15:33.659
What's up with four-eyes?

15:33.661 --> 15:35.027
He's actually really attractive.

15:35.029 --> 15:36.395
Classic big bro hazing.

15:36.397 --> 15:37.663
His name's Darren.

15:37.665 --> 15:38.864
He's actually pretty great.

15:38.866 --> 15:40.199
Yeah, he must be,
in order to get

15:40.201 --> 15:41.600
- the insta-invite to this party.
- I know!

15:41.602 --> 15:43.769
How much do you like that dork?

15:43.771 --> 15:45.404
He's pretty cool with that
accent, though. Still hazing.

15:45.406 --> 15:47.472
I think I really like him.

15:47.474 --> 15:49.574
Yeah, you know who else
is smitten these days? Dad.

15:49.576 --> 15:51.476
- What?
- Did he finally ask out Linda?

15:51.478 --> 15:53.445
My mom? It's finally happening.

15:53.447 --> 15:55.347
- We're gonna be sisters.
- Okay. Slow your roll.

15:55.349 --> 15:57.082
- How do you even know about this?
- Oh, I don't know.

15:57.084 --> 15:59.151
Maybe the 14 speakers he hung
in his house to impress her?

15:59.153 --> 16:01.119
This is actually
perfect timing for my mom,

16:01.121 --> 16:03.422
since my dad just married
the old babysitter.

16:03.424 --> 16:05.190
What about how weird
it makes me feel?

16:05.192 --> 16:07.392
Nobody cares.
This is about Dad being happy.

16:07.394 --> 16:08.994
What are you doing
to that napkin?

16:08.996 --> 16:10.262
Uh, you know what?
I didn't even know

16:10.264 --> 16:11.263
I was doing this.

16:11.265 --> 16:12.864
I need to steal her.

16:12.866 --> 16:14.599
Listen, kid, I just want to say

16:14.601 --> 16:16.101
that I am sorry.

16:16.103 --> 16:18.470
A business industry
associate pointed out to me

16:18.472 --> 16:20.672
that, well,
all of my interfering

16:20.674 --> 16:22.907
might not be good for you.

16:22.909 --> 16:24.943
From now on, I'm going to take

16:24.945 --> 16:26.745
a more traditional
angel approach

16:26.747 --> 16:28.146
and I'm gonna back off.

16:28.148 --> 16:29.914
Based on a small sample

16:29.916 --> 16:32.183
- of all my experience with you...
- Allison,

16:32.185 --> 16:33.952
I'm serious.

16:33.954 --> 16:35.453
And I'm only half in the bag,

16:35.455 --> 16:37.088
so you know it's real.

16:38.958 --> 16:41.559
- I just want to thank you.
- Oh.

16:41.561 --> 16:44.462
Home audio's just not
as difficult as it looks.

16:44.464 --> 16:46.130
Not the speakers.

16:46.132 --> 16:47.465
For this.

16:47.467 --> 16:48.733
Oh.

16:48.735 --> 16:50.201
The mother of the bride

16:50.203 --> 16:53.037
always gets forgotten
at these things and...

16:53.039 --> 16:54.939
you're just so sweet.

16:54.941 --> 16:56.040
Brad made the flower.

16:56.042 --> 16:57.508
I know.

16:57.510 --> 17:00.244
But I am the one
asking you to dance.

17:00.246 --> 17:02.013
Let's do it.

17:05.417 --> 17:07.050
Hey, Darren. I don't know
if you remember me,

17:07.053 --> 17:08.553
but I was the one with the pâté
by the port-a-potty.

17:08.555 --> 17:10.555
- No, I remember you.
- That's sweet.

17:10.557 --> 17:11.923
Nice suit, by the way.

17:11.925 --> 17:14.724
- You are so money, baby.
- What?

17:14.727 --> 17:16.426
You are so money,
you don't even know it.

17:16.429 --> 17:18.262
Uh... ooh.

17:18.263 --> 17:19.797
It's a quote.

17:19.799 --> 17:22.199
From Swingers.
Your favorite movie.

17:22.201 --> 17:24.868
Yes. Yeah, right. Swingers.

17:24.871 --> 17:26.670
Yeah, I'm the big money.

17:26.672 --> 17:28.539
Darren, if you'll excuse me,

17:28.540 --> 17:31.450
I have to double-renege
on a recent promise.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.114
Slow song.

17:38.584 --> 17:39.917
Let's pick it up
a little bit, huh?

17:39.919 --> 17:41.352
A little bit of swing dance,
big band.

17:44.489 --> 17:47.199
That walking redwood
ruins everything.

17:47.331 --> 17:48.057
Follow me.

17:48.123 --> 17:49.493
Oh, my God, did you put
this on for me?

17:49.495 --> 17:50.694
Yes.

17:50.696 --> 17:52.896
Well, let's do this.

17:54.232 --> 17:56.967
Hey, everybody,
check out these two!

18:09.280 --> 18:11.381
- Are you ready?
- Uh-huh.

18:13.619 --> 18:16.186
- Oh! Ooh.
- Ow.

18:16.188 --> 18:19.356
Wait... does he not know
how to swing dance?

18:19.358 --> 18:21.358
- Hey, are you okay?
- Okay?

18:21.360 --> 18:23.827
Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Yeah.

18:23.829 --> 18:26.263
- Yeah. What just happened?
- Yeah, bro.

18:26.265 --> 18:28.416
Can't you execute a classic
cradle-me-Harry?

18:28.442 --> 18:30.975
Brad, could you please go
big brother somewhere else?

18:31.120 --> 18:32.335
I'm sorry, I don't know

18:32.337 --> 18:33.804
how to swing dance.

18:33.806 --> 18:36.239
And when you jumped at me,
that was scary.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.275
Why would you lie about that?

18:38.277 --> 18:40.443
I just really wanted
to impress you.

18:40.445 --> 18:42.986
I kind of got swept up
in the moment.

18:43.315 --> 18:45.782
Sorry, I hope one little
fib's not a big deal.

18:45.784 --> 18:48.518
Look, my last relationship
was a disaster.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.186
The guy lied and cheated.

18:50.188 --> 18:52.088
Allison, I am not that guy.

18:52.090 --> 18:55.425
I know.
But I have a mountain of issues

18:55.427 --> 18:57.594
and I don't think
I'm ready for this.

18:57.596 --> 18:58.828
Couldn't have said it
better myself,

18:58.830 --> 19:00.875
because I did say it myself.

19:01.310 --> 19:02.799
Hey, guys, ooh.

19:02.801 --> 19:04.834
Um, so my father-in-law
wants to give

19:04.836 --> 19:06.803
a toast, so if we could
just finish the breakup

19:06.805 --> 19:09.739
off the dance floor?
Thank you so much. Okay.

19:09.741 --> 19:11.207
Speech, speech!

19:11.209 --> 19:13.209
Maybe this is just
a case of bad timing.

19:13.211 --> 19:14.611
Yeah, and you lying.

19:14.613 --> 19:16.079
Sorry. Trust issues.

19:16.081 --> 19:17.480
I'm gonna work on those.

19:17.482 --> 19:19.382
Yeah, I'm gonna work
through my stuff, too.

19:19.384 --> 19:22.218
Hey, who knows? Maybe one day...

19:22.220 --> 19:23.786
Our paths cross again?

19:23.788 --> 19:25.989
I'd like that.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.729
USA! USA! U...

19:32.731 --> 19:35.264
I'm actually a big fan of
Sydney. I want to visit someday.

19:35.266 --> 19:37.500
I heard the Opera House
is a marvel.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.284
How's your butt?

19:40.468 --> 19:42.338
Oh. It's okay.

19:42.340 --> 19:44.574
Well, you know, he's not
your only soulmate.

19:44.576 --> 19:46.742
Not that I believe you, but...

19:46.744 --> 19:49.211
- how many are we talking?
- 17.

19:49.213 --> 19:51.147
But a couple of them are
in the flood zone of the tsunami

19:51.149 --> 19:53.049
that takes out
the Pacific Northwest, so, uh,

19:53.051 --> 19:54.450
actually, it's 15.

19:54.452 --> 19:56.218
Let's put some ice
on that tukhus, huh?

19:56.220 --> 19:57.453
We're going roller
skating tomorrow.

19:57.455 --> 19:59.055
Oh, what happened to hands off?

19:59.057 --> 20:01.023
Eh, I tried that for five
minutes, it's not me.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.092
In fact, I'm gonna need
a key to the big house.

20:03.094 --> 20:05.127
- Not gonna happen.
- Can I have some more drink tickets?

20:05.129 --> 20:07.263
- Are you kidding me?
- They're for a friend.

20:07.265 --> 20:08.831
I'm sorry.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.766
Bad time to lie to you.

20:10.768 --> 20:12.768
So, should you warn someone
about the tsunami?

20:12.770 --> 20:14.336
Oh, no, no, no, no,

20:14.338 --> 20:16.972
I never get involved with
the weather department.

20:21.167 --> 20:23.411
Hey, what's up, John? Seen Lee?

20:23.477 --> 20:25.123
Cops did a sweep of the park.

20:25.242 --> 20:27.695
He ended up in Cedars.
Psych ward.

20:27.814 --> 20:30.083
Our Lee? Picnic Table Lee?

20:30.228 --> 20:31.709
He kept telling them
he had to be here

20:31.711 --> 20:33.544
because he was a guardian angel.

20:33.546 --> 20:35.646
Wow. Well, that's crazy.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.920
Damn!

20:39.065 --> 20:41.295
Lost too many good
angels to Cedars.
