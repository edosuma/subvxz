(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.271 --> 00:06.607
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.176
In New York City,

00:08.209 --> 00:10.411
the dedicated detectives
who investigate

00:10.444 --> 00:13.181
these vicious felonies are
members of an elite squad

00:13.214 --> 00:14.582
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.517
These are their stories.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.354
Sonya Purcell, 33.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.156
Drunk driver T-boned
the family car.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.157
(Doctor)
She driving?

00:23.191 --> 00:25.059
Front passenger.
Full intrusion.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.026
Any other passengers?

00:26.060 --> 00:27.328
Husband and
nine year-old daughter, Holly.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.696
On the two buses
right behind us.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.331
Decompressed her three times.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.299
She's tachy to 110.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.233
BP's 90-palp.

00:32.266 --> 00:35.169
Pupils reactive.
Responds to painful stimuli.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.505
Larry Purcell, 35,
driving the car.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.840
Got himself a compound
tib-fib fracture

00:39.873 --> 00:41.242
when the transmission
came through the floor.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.243
Larry, can you hear me?

00:42.276 --> 00:43.311
My wife--
my daughter--

00:43.344 --> 00:44.412
We're taking good care of 'em.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.746
We're gonna take you up
to surgery now.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.181
Fix that broken leg.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.249
Okay, here we go.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.450
Let's go, let's go!

00:49.483 --> 00:51.152
Holly...
Holly, I'm Dr. Turk.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.321
You got a nasty bump on your
head. Anything else hurt?

00:53.354 --> 00:54.288
My stomach.
Were you wearing
your seatbelt?

00:54.322 --> 00:56.757
Yes.
Okay, let's get you inside,
take a look.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.726
Here we go.

01:03.331 --> 01:06.800
C-spine's clear.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.536
Where's my mom and dad?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.271
The doctors
are helping them.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.772
Show me
where your tummy hurts.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.574
On my bellybutton.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.443
Sometimes when you're
in a car accident,

01:15.476 --> 01:18.446
and you wear your seatbelt
like you're supposed to,

01:18.479 --> 01:20.348
the belt can hurt
your tummy.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.716
Please take off her pants
and underwear.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.185
Stop it!
Don't touch me!

01:24.218 --> 01:25.853
No, no, we're just gonna make
sure you're okay.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.289
No! No!
Please don't do it!

01:28.322 --> 01:29.590
All right, Holly.
Holly.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.691
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.760
I want you--
Holly, Holly.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.396
I want you to close your eyes.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.897
Try to rest.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.334
I'm gonna go check in
on your mom and dad, okay?

01:40.368 --> 01:42.236
Page the shrink on call.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.309
I'm Dr. Hendrix.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.378
You must be Holly.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.579
Hi.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.314
I just saw your dad.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.348
The doctors
are fixing his leg now.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.284
When can I see them?

01:56.317 --> 01:58.519
As soon as they get
out of surgery.

01:58.552 --> 02:01.422
Dr. Turk told me
you got pretty upset

02:01.455 --> 02:03.657
when he tried
to take your pants off.

02:03.691 --> 02:04.792
I didn't want him to.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.460
He needs to examine you.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.561
I don't like him.

02:07.595 --> 02:10.898
I'll get you
a really nice doctor.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.433
A girl, like us.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.202
And I'll stay here with you.
How's that?

02:18.672 --> 02:20.441
I guess so.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.378
See?
I told ya.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.946
That didn't hurt,
did it?

02:25.979 --> 02:26.947
No.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.349
Am I okay?

02:28.382 --> 02:31.519
Your tummy is fine, Holly.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.424
You were right.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.426
She's been abused.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.329
I'll call Special Victims.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.647
What made you suspect abuse?

03:33.681 --> 03:35.749
She kicked the attending

03:35.783 --> 03:37.885
when the nurse tried
to take her pants off.

03:37.918 --> 03:38.952
She looks pretty calm now.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.421
It was a male attending.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.755
Dr. Sanada's a pediatric

03:41.789 --> 03:42.856
sex-abuse specialist.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.325
She found scarring
and thinning

03:44.358 --> 03:46.460
of Holly's
posterior forchette.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.296
You do a rape kit?
Only swabs and
a visual inspection.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.297
Holly was too upset

03:49.330 --> 03:51.465
to do an internal.

03:51.499 --> 03:54.768
Dr. Sanada would like
to examine her with a colposcope

03:54.802 --> 03:56.737
to see if there's any tearing
of the hymen.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.572
What's she waiting for?
Parental consent.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.608
Her mom and dad were pretty
banged up in the accident.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.009
They're both in surgery.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.110
Well, it shouldn't
be a problem.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.779
Parent would wanna know if their
kid was being abused.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.815
You'd want a doctor to do
a gynecological exam

04:07.848 --> 04:10.284
on your nine year-old
without asking you?
Look...

04:10.318 --> 04:12.320
the longer we wait,
the more evidence is lost.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.821
You're right,
but if Holly's

04:13.854 --> 04:16.390
scared by swabs, a speculum's
gonna really freak her out.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.257
Well, we can

04:17.291 --> 04:19.427
sedate her first
to minimize the trauma.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.728
Let's do it.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.296
This isn't
life or death.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.297
And anesthesia

04:23.331 --> 04:24.832
comes with some risk.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.567
And the hospital
will have my ass

04:26.600 --> 04:27.568
if we're not covered legally.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.503
I'm gonna make
a phone call.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.373
I got it.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.874
Court order giving
the hospital authority

04:33.907 --> 04:35.476
to do the colposcopy on Holly,
including sedation.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.910
Her parents are in surgery.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.612
Are you gonna stay and explain
this when they're out?

04:38.646 --> 04:40.648
I can't. I've got
an arraignment in an hour.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.450
You wanted this, you're gonna
have to take the heat.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.685
I'll--I'll tell her parents
why we couldn't wait.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.854
Let me know
if you find anything.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.489
How soon can the doctor
do the procedure?

04:48.522 --> 04:50.924
Right away. One of you
should come in with me.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.427
If Holly discloses
as she's going under,

04:53.461 --> 04:54.695
I'll need you
to memorialize it.

04:54.728 --> 04:55.763
I'll go.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.798
Exam 2.
Ten minutes.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.903
(Hendrix)
Holly, this is
Detective Stabler.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.405
Hi, can I come in?

05:04.438 --> 05:05.339
He's a policeman.

05:05.373 --> 05:09.042
He has something
to tell you.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.844
We caught the guy
who hit your car.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.614
Good.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.449
(Sanada)
Holly, the nurse
is going to put

05:15.483 --> 05:16.550
the IV in your arm now.

05:16.584 --> 05:17.651
It'll only sting
for a second.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.520
You ready?
No.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.422
I wish my dad was here.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.425
You'll see him
in a while.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.795
What's your most favorite thing
you like to do with your dad?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.797
I got twins your age,
and we like

05:29.830 --> 05:31.532
to go to the beach
together.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.633
My dad takes me

05:32.666 --> 05:34.602
to the beach, too.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.438
We build sand castles.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.473
I don't like needles.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.442
Okay, hold onto my hand.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.611
Now, close your eyes and pretend
that you're at the beach

05:43.644 --> 05:46.914
building sand castles
with your dad.

05:46.947 --> 05:47.748
And if it hurts,

05:47.781 --> 05:49.950
you squeeze my hand
really hard, okay?

05:49.983 --> 05:51.752
What do you do
when something hurts?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.556
I think of my kids.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.728
Is that it?
That's it.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.762
You did great.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.130
(Sanada)
We're ready.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.164
Holly, you're going
to sleep now.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.967
When you wake up,
it'll all be over, okay?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.570
Okay.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.439
Will you be here?

06:11.472 --> 06:12.706
I have to go
back to work.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.608
But if you need me,
you tell Dr. Hendrix,

06:14.642 --> 06:16.444
and I'll come
running back, okay?

06:16.477 --> 06:17.645
Thanks.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.053
(Stabler)
How'd everything go?

06:26.086 --> 06:26.987
Holly came through it great,

06:27.020 --> 06:29.122
and we discharged her
to her grandparents.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.558
The results
are another story.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.960
Small, unhealed tear
and scarring on the hymen.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.495
Holly was abused.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.829
We gotta talk to her.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.931
Talk to her father first.
He's out of recovery.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.099
(Larry)
Drunken bastard

06:39.132 --> 06:40.100
ran a red light.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.602
I never saw him coming.

06:41.635 --> 06:42.670
(Benson)
We're not here about

06:42.703 --> 06:44.472
the car accident,
Mr. Purcell.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.639
It's about Holly.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.508
The doctors swore
she's okay.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.710
She is, but when
the doctors examined her,

06:49.743 --> 06:52.613
they found other injuries.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.413
What injuries?

06:53.447 --> 06:57.485
She may have been
sexually abused.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.624
Did she tell you that?

07:03.657 --> 07:04.992
No.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.226
But the doctors did
a gynecological exam.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.227
Without asking

07:07.260 --> 07:08.629
me or her mother?

07:08.662 --> 07:09.497
(Stabler)
You were both in surgery.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.764
We asked the court
for permission.

07:10.798 --> 07:11.832
This is a big mistake.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.767
My daughter was not
sexually abused.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.669
Mr. Purcell, the evidence--
Because she fell
off her bike

07:15.703 --> 07:18.639
and hurt herself
between her legs.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.575
You want proof,
ask the doctor.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.015
Happened two weeks ago.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.983
Holly fell on
the right bike pedal,

07:30.017 --> 07:33.487
spikes caused an injury
to her posterior forchette.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.656
So we just had her poked and
prodded for nothing.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.990
Maybe not.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.192
The report doesn't mention
the tear to the hymen.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.994
And the tear hasn't healed.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.063
It probably happened
within the last week.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.498
Can you say that
for sure?

07:44.532 --> 07:45.633
No.
Well, you better be sure

07:45.666 --> 07:47.200
before we put this little girl
through any more hell.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.571
You saw the same fear
in her eyes I did.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.205
Olivia, you should
do the interview.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.041
No, I thought I had
a rapport going with her.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.909
You know, I interview
little girls every day.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.244
Still, she'll feel more

07:57.277 --> 08:00.047
comfortable talking to
a woman about her own body.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.515
We still need to get
the father to agree.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.083
What if he's the one
abusing Holly?

08:03.116 --> 08:04.618
He wasn't lying
about the bike injury.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.919
He let the doctor examine her.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.187
I don't think he's our guy.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.689
Good,
'cause we'll need his help.

08:08.722 --> 08:09.857
For what?

08:09.890 --> 08:10.858
The interview.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.125
He can give us information,

08:12.159 --> 08:13.661
tell us if Holly's
being truthful.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.062
You'll wear an earpiece
so I'll be able

08:15.095 --> 08:16.163
to talk to you.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.197
Okay.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.135
(Benson)
So Holly,
what you like to play?

08:22.169 --> 08:25.673
Video games, but only
when I can't go outside.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.675
What do you do outside?

08:27.708 --> 08:29.643
(Holly)
Go to the park.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.645
Dad and I
ride our bikes together.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.547
Last time we did
is when she fell.

08:33.581 --> 08:37.150
Ask about their last ride.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.587
So do you and your dad
go riding every weekend?

08:39.620 --> 08:40.888
Used to.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.656
But I stopped.
How come?

08:42.690 --> 08:44.725
'Cause my mom and dad say
it's getting too cold outside.

08:44.758 --> 08:45.659
We didn't say that.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.695
Doctor wanted
to give her time to heal.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.931
Don't let that go.
Confront her about the accident.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.033
Now, your dad said that you

08:53.066 --> 08:54.635
fell off your bike.
Yeah.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.605
Hit a wet spot
and skidded out.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.673
Did you hurt yourself?

08:59.707 --> 09:00.841
Just a little.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.611
I skinned my knee.
It was bleeding.

09:03.644 --> 09:04.978
It was barely a scratch.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.580
(Stabler)
Let's push Holly

09:06.614 --> 09:08.616
just a little harder.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.652
Talk about
the other injury.

09:11.685 --> 09:15.022
Your dad told me that you hurt
yourself someplace else, too.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.290
Yeah.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.593
Where?

09:19.627 --> 09:21.695
Between my legs.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.764
That must've hurt a lot.

09:23.797 --> 09:24.932
I don't remember.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.133
Why won't she talk about it?

09:26.166 --> 09:27.134
She did when it happened.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.770
Go for it.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.640
You know, Holly,

09:32.673 --> 09:35.609
the other night I was at the
hospital with Detective Stabler

09:35.643 --> 09:36.710
after your car accident.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.746
And I talked
to the doctor.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.781
When she looked between
your legs, she said

09:40.814 --> 09:42.716
that you were hurt.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.952
But it wasn't from falling off
your bike.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.287
Yes, it was.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.390
No, Holly.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.626
That would've been impossible.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.266
Sweetheart,
why are you crying?

09:59.299 --> 10:01.301
I'm afraid.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.036
What are you afraid of?

10:03.070 --> 10:04.805
(Holly)
I can't tell you.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.039
(Benson)
Why not?

10:06.073 --> 10:07.675
Because he'll hurt me.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.643
Who'll hurt you, Holly?

10:09.677 --> 10:12.179
Honey, who will hurt you?

10:12.212 --> 10:15.315
Holly, has this person
hurt you before?

10:17.918 --> 10:18.952
Yes.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.353
How?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.089
He--

10:22.122 --> 10:26.259
He touched me--

10:26.293 --> 10:29.930
between my legs.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.700
Made me touch him.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.901
(Benson)
Can you tell me his name?

10:33.934 --> 10:36.169
(Holly)
Please don't make me tell.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.107
Holly, listen to me.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.142
If I know who he is,

10:42.175 --> 10:45.145
I promise you he will never hurt
you again, okay?

10:45.178 --> 10:46.446
He will!

10:46.479 --> 10:50.250
He has a gun.
He showed it to me.

10:50.283 --> 10:54.788
He said if I ever told anyone
what he did,

10:54.822 --> 10:58.792
he'd shoot me.

10:58.826 --> 11:03.764
Just like he shot
that girl in the park.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.477
(Cragen)
Laura Swift, eight years old.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.412
Student at St. Mary's
in Queens.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.414
Disappeared last May
from a school picnic

11:21.448 --> 11:22.249
at Flushing Meadow Park.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.951
I remember her body
was never found.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.118
Talked to Queens homicide.

11:25.152 --> 11:28.121
Only evidence was some blood
spatter and a shell casing

11:28.155 --> 11:29.422
found in the boathouse
at Meadow Lake.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.991
Well, it fits.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.460
Holly and Laura, the same age,
so he's got a type.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.995
Then he told Holly
he already shot a kid.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.064
Bragging about his body count
to a nine year-old.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.499
Scared her so bad, she's afraid
to tell us who he is.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.335
He knows he can control his
victims by threatening them.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.337
(Cragen)
Garden variety pedophile
would never kill

11:44.371 --> 11:45.472
a victim.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.240
This guy is
a violent child molester.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.776
(Stabler)
He's not afraid
to use that gun.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.177
Long as he's out there,

11:50.210 --> 11:51.378
Holly's life is at risk
and she knows it.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.347
Which is why I'm not sure
we're gonna get anything more

11:54.381 --> 11:56.083
than this partial disclosure.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.450
(Benson)
Well, Holly copped
to the abuse

11:57.484 --> 11:59.286
when we told her that we knew
what the doctor found.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.822
Every time we've confronted her
with the facts, she's opened up.

12:01.855 --> 12:05.058
The problem is
we're all out of facts,

12:05.092 --> 12:07.027
and the Laura Swift case
is cold.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.095
Any ideas?

12:08.128 --> 12:09.096
(Hendrix)
Waiting

12:09.129 --> 12:10.530
may be the only way.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.799
We push her too hard,

12:11.832 --> 12:13.466
she could have
a psychotic break.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.536
Holly's gotta talk.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.938
You're the shrink.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.306
You got anything?

12:19.339 --> 12:21.074
Well, there is something
I haven't tried yet.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.546
(Hendrix)
I'd like to do
a deeper psychodynamic

12:26.579 --> 12:29.316
interview with Holly using
projective techniques.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.517
Like drawing.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.551
(Larry)
Holly can barely eat or sleep.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.453
I don't want
to make it worse.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.256
(Benson)
The pressure on her isn't
coming from us, Mr. Purcell.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.525
It's coming from the man
who molested her.

12:38.558 --> 12:41.795
Holly's never gonna feel safe
until we arrest him.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.496
I just don't think she can take
another interview.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.466
I won't ask her any direct
questions about the abuse.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.268
This will be more like
psychotherapy.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.270
It'll give Holly a safe way

12:50.303 --> 12:52.572
to open up.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.908
[sighs]

12:54.942 --> 12:56.409
I don't know.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.845
Mrs. Purcell,

12:57.878 --> 12:59.847
this man has threatened
to kill your daughter.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.883
He claimed to have murdered
Laura Swift last year.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.154
If we let you do this,

13:07.187 --> 13:10.323
can you promise us
it won't hurt Holly?
No.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.492
But I will talk to her alone,
without the police,

13:12.525 --> 13:13.927
and I'll let her set the pace.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.495
And if she doesn't
want to talk?

13:15.528 --> 13:18.198
I'll stop.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.040
I saw your mom today.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.009
She looks great.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.111
She told me
she's coming home soon.

13:33.580 --> 13:34.447
Finished.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.483
May I see?

13:36.516 --> 13:39.352
Sure.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.553
Wow.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.855
What should I draw next?

13:41.889 --> 13:44.024
How about a picture
of yourself

13:44.057 --> 13:45.859
doing something?

13:45.893 --> 13:48.528
So this is your dad
and your mom and you.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.933
Who's this?

13:52.966 --> 13:54.201
My grandma and grandpa.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.569
I'm staying with them
until my parents come home.

13:56.603 --> 13:57.604
You like it there?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.506
Sort of.
It smells like cats.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.576
Do you like cats?

14:03.610 --> 14:05.278
I'm more of a dog person.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.181
Me too.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.616
Is that your house?

14:09.649 --> 14:10.884
Nope.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.419
It's Lily and Anna's.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.954
Who are they?

14:13.987 --> 14:14.955
My cousins.

14:14.988 --> 14:17.290
What's their last name?

14:17.324 --> 14:18.491
Dobbins.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.427
I go over there
to play with them.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.229
They live across
the street from me.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.496
(Julie)
Well, they're not
really cousins.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.165
Sonya and I
went to college together,

14:25.198 --> 14:26.533
and our girls
have known each other

14:26.566 --> 14:27.534
all their lives.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.535
We've been Holly's

14:28.568 --> 14:30.403
Aunt Julie and Uncle Mark
since she could talk.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.538
Does Holly spend
a lot of time

14:31.571 --> 14:33.206
with your daughters?

14:33.240 --> 14:35.208
She's here more
than she's home.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.477
Sometimes I kid her folks
that I'm gonna have

14:37.510 --> 14:38.378
to put another bed
in our girls' bedroom.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.512
(Stabler)
She ever confide in you?

14:39.546 --> 14:40.513
Maybe tell you things

14:40.547 --> 14:42.149
she wouldn't tell her parents?

14:42.182 --> 14:43.216
No, Holly--

14:43.250 --> 14:45.118
she's not secretive,
you know?

14:45.152 --> 14:46.954
Mark, she did come
to me recently.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.555
About what?

14:48.588 --> 14:50.457
She was having trouble
at school,

14:50.490 --> 14:52.592
someone was teasing her
in class.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.596
(Hendrix)
You're a hard worker.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.932
You must do really well
in school.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.268
I like my classes a lot.
Yeah?

15:01.301 --> 15:03.136
What's your favorite?

15:03.170 --> 15:07.140
Art.
I can tell.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.576
Put a lot of details
into your own house.

15:09.609 --> 15:13.713
Windows, pretty curtains.

15:13.746 --> 15:19.953
But why are the shades down
in this room?

15:19.987 --> 15:24.424
Because the person inside
wants to sleep.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.026
Do you have a favorite teacher
at school?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.694
Mrs. Wheeler.

15:27.727 --> 15:30.163
Guess what she teaches.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.164
Uh...

15:31.198 --> 15:32.499
Art?

15:32.532 --> 15:34.167
[laughs]

15:34.201 --> 15:35.668
I wish I could show you.

15:35.702 --> 15:36.669
I painted a really--

15:36.703 --> 15:37.570
(Mrs. Wheeler)
Great tiger.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.974
So much detail,
expressive use of color.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.442
Holly's very talented.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.276
(Munch)
I can see that.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.312
I'll bet not many other
nine year-olds

15:45.345 --> 15:46.613
reference Picasso
in their works.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.981
Well, that was her assignment.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.749
But I'm sure
you didn't come here

15:49.782 --> 15:50.617
just to look
at Holly's pictures.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.685
She ever come to you
with any problems?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.421
Never.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.756
But I'd hope she would if
something were bothering her.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.458
Notice any change
in her behavior--

15:58.491 --> 15:59.492
Moody, depressed,
or withdrawn?

15:59.526 --> 16:00.660
[laughs]
No.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.463
Those are my high school
students.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.232
Holly has been
at the school nurse

16:05.265 --> 16:06.766
a few times
this month, though.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.767
(Fin)
You know why?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.569
A stomach ache
a few weeks ago,

16:09.602 --> 16:11.338
and then last week
she was holding

16:11.371 --> 16:12.539
a pair of scissors
the wrong way.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.574
I reminded her to cut away
from the body,

16:14.607 --> 16:17.610
but a moment later,
her hand was all bloody.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.712
(Benson)
Do you think
it was an accident?

16:19.746 --> 16:20.747
No.

16:20.780 --> 16:21.748
How do you know?

16:21.781 --> 16:23.716
'Cause Holly's got a pattern.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.553
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
she has Art, then Gym.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.655
The last three weeks,
right after Art

16:28.688 --> 16:31.324
she's come here
with some injury or ailment

16:31.358 --> 16:33.693
so she can get out of P.E.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.630
What do you do
in gym class?

16:37.664 --> 16:41.334
We play soccer.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.403
Who's that girl
over there by herself?

16:46.173 --> 16:48.108
I don't know.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.709
I hate gym.

16:49.742 --> 16:53.713
How come?

16:53.746 --> 16:57.684
I don't like changing in front
of the other girls.

16:57.717 --> 17:01.754
They tease me.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.190
I hate soccer.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.457
(Benson)
Excuse me.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.492
Yeah, can I help you?

17:05.525 --> 17:06.493
Is that
the girls' gym class?

17:06.526 --> 17:07.660
Yeah.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.695
Yeah, what's
the teacher's name?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.063
Uh, I don't know.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.698
You new here?

17:11.731 --> 17:12.799
No, they have a substitute.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.701
Coach D. went home early.
He's got a big game tonight.

17:14.734 --> 17:15.768
What's the "D" stand for?
Dobbins.

17:15.802 --> 17:19.706
Mark Dobbins is
the gym teacher?

17:19.739 --> 17:20.640
And our best coach.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.242
I mean, the football team's
been city champs

17:22.275 --> 17:23.243
eight years running.
[whistle blows]

17:23.276 --> 17:24.244
I gotta go.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.813
(Stabler)
Thanks.

17:26.846 --> 17:30.217
Uncle Mark didn't tell us
he was Holly's gym teacher.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.719
He teaches gym.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.322
And you don't like gym.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.524
No.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.558
Why not?

17:44.164 --> 17:45.732
My tummy hurts.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.300
Holly.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.636
I don't want
to talk anymore.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.803
Just a little longer.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.139
[crying]
No!

17:52.172 --> 17:53.473
Holly, please, tell me
what's wrong?

17:53.506 --> 17:56.243
Don't make me say!

17:56.276 --> 17:58.178
I'm scared.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.312
I know.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.181
I know,
but you've gotta trust me.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.783
No! Please!

18:03.816 --> 18:04.717
Tell me your secret, Holly.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.553
Tell me.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.724
Is this the person
who hurt you?

18:11.758 --> 18:12.725
Yes!

18:12.759 --> 18:13.860
Who is it, Holly?

18:13.893 --> 18:15.728
What's his name?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.764
[crying]

18:17.797 --> 18:20.333
Who is it, Holly?
What's his name?

18:22.902 --> 18:25.838
Uncle Mark.

18:25.872 --> 18:29.542
I didn't want him to!

18:29.576 --> 18:32.545
I told him to stop,
but he wouldn't!

18:35.448 --> 18:38.785
[crying]

18:41.854 --> 18:42.889
(Dobbins)
Run it! Come on, now!

18:42.922 --> 18:45.658
Von B!
Hit Von B, he's open!

18:45.692 --> 18:46.793
Come on, hit him!

18:46.826 --> 18:49.329
Yes!
Nice catch! Not now!

18:49.362 --> 18:50.363
Dobbins!
Game's over.

18:50.397 --> 18:51.731
What--What are you
talking about?

18:51.764 --> 18:53.533
We're talking about a little
girl who trusted you,

18:53.566 --> 18:54.834
and you molested her.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.436
Mark Dobbins, you're under
arrest for sexual abuse.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.804
You're kidding me.

18:57.837 --> 18:58.805
You're wrong.

18:58.838 --> 18:59.939
You're making a mistake!

18:59.972 --> 19:02.141
You don't un--

19:04.211 --> 19:05.612
(Stabler)
You're a busy guy, Mark.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.214
Teaching gym.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.550
Coaching girls' soccer,
gymnastics, and...

19:10.583 --> 19:12.852
still find time to give
private lessons, huh?

19:12.885 --> 19:14.354
Those lessons help
pay my mortgage.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.722
So seeing the little girls
in leotards

19:15.755 --> 19:16.723
is just a bonus?

19:16.756 --> 19:18.458
I also coach football.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.294
And you run a sleep-away camp in
the Poconos during the summer.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.231
You spend an awful lot of time
alone with kids, Mark.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.932
And that makes me
a child molester?

19:25.965 --> 19:27.867
You ever been
to Flushing Meadow Park?

19:27.900 --> 19:30.637
Sure. My girls love the zoo and
the--and the science museum.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.505
What does that got to do
with anything?

19:32.539 --> 19:33.440
Laura Swift

19:33.473 --> 19:34.941
disappeared from Flushing Meadow
last year.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.979
You were in
the park that day.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.450
Queens Homicide
interviewed you.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.685
Along with 1,000 other people.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.387
I don't even know this girl.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.489
Why would I kill her?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.258
Did you say
she was dead?

19:51.291 --> 19:52.392
Not me.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.561
Maybe Mark here knows something
that we don't know.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.596
It was all over the news.
Everybody thinks she's dead.

19:56.629 --> 19:57.697
Well, I'll tell you
what I think.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.632
You snatched Laura Swift,
you raped her,

19:59.666 --> 20:00.500
and then when she threatened
to tell,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.602
you murdered her,
and you hid her body.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.704
You laid low
for a while, but...

20:04.737 --> 20:05.705
you wanted another girl.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.739
Holly Purcell was perfect.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.244
I never touched Holly Purcell!

20:11.278 --> 20:12.945
She's at your house
all the time.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.647
She's in your class
at school.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.915
You couldn't stop
thinking about her.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.984
Holly's like one
of my own daughters.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.752
You give "private lessons"
to your daughters too?

20:19.786 --> 20:20.753
You're disgusting!
How dare you!

20:20.787 --> 20:22.355
I'm disgusting?

20:22.389 --> 20:24.324
Holly told us
what you did to her.
Then she's lying!

20:24.357 --> 20:25.458
You tore her up

20:25.492 --> 20:26.793
and she's got
the scars to prove it.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.429
I don't know what in hell
is going on around here!

20:29.462 --> 20:31.898
But I'm not saying another word!
I want a lawyer!

20:34.367 --> 20:35.568
[metal slams]
Elliot.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.570
Take it easy.
I pushed him too hard.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.307
He would've lawyered up
no matter what.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.542
What happens to Holly when
that dirtbag makes bail?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.043
He's not going to.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.812
Two other girls
at Chestnut Academy

20:45.845 --> 20:48.581
just outcried to their parents
that Dobbins molested them.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.617
When are you gonna put
that bastard in jail?

20:50.650 --> 20:51.618
(Cragen)
We already have.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.286
My Nicole is scared to death.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.288
You can't let him out!
(Benson)
Dobbins can't

20:55.322 --> 20:57.590
hurt her anymore, but we need
you both to calm down.

20:57.624 --> 20:58.491
(Terry)
How can we be calm

20:58.525 --> 21:00.627
after what that man
did to our girls?

21:00.660 --> 21:01.961
God knows how many others
he's abused!

21:01.994 --> 21:02.762
Ladies. Ladies!

21:02.795 --> 21:05.965
You could help us,
but please...

21:05.998 --> 21:07.667
Please.

21:10.937 --> 21:14.006
Did Danielle and Nicole talk
to each other about this?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.976
No. Nicole told me,
then I called Donna.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.512
She said her daughter
told her the same thing.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.814
We heard he molested Holly,
so I called her mother,

21:21.848 --> 21:23.015
and she said
to see you.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.717
Will the girls
have to testify?

21:24.751 --> 21:25.552
(Cragen)
We're a long ways

21:25.585 --> 21:26.486
from there.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.588
First they have
to tell us what happened.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.589
Please don't do that.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.491
Let us tell you
what they said.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.592
We can't charge

21:32.625 --> 21:33.726
Dobbins with abusing them

21:33.760 --> 21:35.695
unless they describe
what he did.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.831
Can we come in with them?
They're just little girls!

21:38.865 --> 21:41.434
I'm sorry, but the only way
their accusations

21:41.468 --> 21:44.471
will stand up in court is
if we talk to them alone.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.074
(Nicole)
I was afraid to tell.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.976
But then Holly did.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.978
Nicole, how do you
know Holly?

21:52.011 --> 21:53.846
We're best friends.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.548
And so's Danielle.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.016
We're all
in the same class.

21:57.049 --> 22:00.453
And do you guys, um...

22:00.487 --> 22:02.455
do stuff together
after school?

22:02.489 --> 22:04.624
Well, we play soccer.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.592
(Benson)
So what happened
at soccer?

22:05.625 --> 22:08.695
Mr. Dobbins said
to come with him to his car.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.897
He told my parents
he'd take me home.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.732
Then he drove me
to his house.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.133
And what happened
at his house?

22:14.166 --> 22:17.704
He took me
to the basement

22:17.737 --> 22:19.706
because that's where
all the toys are.

22:19.739 --> 22:20.707
(Stabler)
What happened
in the basement?

22:20.740 --> 22:23.710
He made me take
my pants off.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.778
And then he touched me
between my legs.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.947
Then he pulled his pants down.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.852
He made me touch him.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.387
He said he would shoot me--

22:34.421 --> 22:36.756
--if I ever told anybody.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.431
We don't need a psychic.

22:44.464 --> 22:45.565
If you're that good,
who's gonna win the Super Bowl?

22:45.598 --> 22:48.468
I'm not evading your question.
What is your question?

22:48.501 --> 22:50.036
Hold on.
Special Victims Unit...

22:50.069 --> 22:51.037
(Cragen)
How many?

22:51.070 --> 22:52.805
Three walk-ins,
five more calls.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.507
All parents
from Chestnut Academy saying

22:54.541 --> 22:56.443
that Dobbins may have abused
their kids.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.710
Word travels fast.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.479
Well, you know,
a couple hundred people

22:59.512 --> 23:00.913
at that football game
saw us collar Dobbins.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.649
He's locked up,
the kids feel safer,

23:02.682 --> 23:03.783
they go home
and tell their parents.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.619
Get the callers in here.
Novak's gonna want statements.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.855
(Fin)
Captain, we got the Ledger
and Channel 3 both on hold

23:08.888 --> 23:10.523
wanting to know
what's up with Chestnut.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.658
Tell 'em no comment.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.693
Refer all press calls
to DCPI.

23:13.726 --> 23:14.761
(Stabler)
Hey.

23:14.794 --> 23:15.928
Hey, how's Holly?

23:15.962 --> 23:18.598
She's a mess. Not eating or
sleeping, wetting her bed.

23:18.631 --> 23:19.699
She didn't tell me anything.

23:19.732 --> 23:20.700
Even though she knows

23:20.733 --> 23:21.568
Dobbins is in jail?

23:21.601 --> 23:23.169
She still thinks
he can get to her.

23:23.202 --> 23:24.170
What is this?

23:24.203 --> 23:25.171
Other possible incidents

23:25.204 --> 23:27.206
Dobbins could be
connected to.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.542
(Benson)
We have six girls gone missing
in the last year.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.644
All around Holly's age
and description.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.780
The last two rows are
all missing girls

23:33.813 --> 23:36.516
in the tri-state area,
also in the last year.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.050
(Cragen)
Get Dobbins' mugshot
in an array.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.186
I want every one of these
victims and witnesses

23:40.219 --> 23:41.954
reinterviewed,
see if anybody can ID him.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.523
(Stabler)
Captain, if he murdered
Laura Swift,

23:43.556 --> 23:45.492
who knows where he went
to find another victim.

23:45.525 --> 23:47.126
We gotta get his photo
to the FBI.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.127
It's done.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.597
I got the search warrant
for the Dobbins' house.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.864
It's good for any forensics
and the gun.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.534
It's a license
to look anywhere.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.203
I'm gonna tear
the place apart.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.437
There's nothing in the car.

23:58.471 --> 24:01.608
Crime Scene's flatbedding it
to the lab to check for blood.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.175
(Stabler)
Computers--check 'em all
for kiddie porn.

24:03.209 --> 24:04.677
Pornography?

24:04.711 --> 24:06.746
My husband's not
that kind of man.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.747
Your husband's
a child molester.

24:07.780 --> 24:08.848
You should talk
to your daughters.

24:08.881 --> 24:09.749
He never touched them.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.150
The victims were abused
in this room.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.919
They described this basement.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.554
The inside of his car.

24:14.587 --> 24:16.556
How it felt
when he touched them.

24:16.589 --> 24:17.790
You should make sure
your kids are okay.

24:17.824 --> 24:18.791
My husband would die

24:18.825 --> 24:20.727
before he hurt a child.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.829
He was never alone
with any of those girls.

24:22.862 --> 24:23.830
I was here!

24:23.863 --> 24:24.697
You were right here,

24:24.731 --> 24:26.198
you didn't do
a damn thing about it?

24:26.232 --> 24:27.967
It was happening right
under your roof,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.769
and you tell me
what a great guy

24:29.802 --> 24:30.837
your husband is?

24:30.870 --> 24:32.071
Lady, you're as sick
as he is!

24:32.104 --> 24:33.806
Elliot.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.816
[dogs barking]

24:43.850 --> 24:45.217
[panting]

24:45.251 --> 24:47.654
I gotta get out of here.
I'm losing it.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.522
It's okay, Elliot.
You gotta calm down.

24:49.556 --> 24:52.925
I nearly punched that woman
in the face in there.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.861
I can't do this anymore.
I can't do this.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.796
You know, this is tough
on all of us.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.030
It was never this hard.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.169
Look, you're under
a lot of stress right now.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.104
Why don't you go home
and get some rest?

25:07.807 --> 25:09.175
The house is empty.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.246
Call Kathy.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.916
Call your kids
and go see them.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.785
It's not the same.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.854
How do you walk away?

25:21.888 --> 25:25.124
You just don't walk away
after 20 years.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.693
How do you walk away?

25:33.099 --> 25:34.834
(Fin)
Told you not to eat

25:34.867 --> 25:36.836
that supermarket sushi.
Yeah.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.304
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:38.337 --> 25:39.772
Find anything?

25:39.806 --> 25:42.274
No gun,
but take a look at this.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.811
Erie County District
Attorney's Office?

25:44.844 --> 25:46.846
Dobbins has
a sealed arrest in Buffalo.

25:46.879 --> 25:47.947
What's the charge?

25:47.980 --> 25:49.616
(Novak)
Soliciting a prostitute.

25:49.649 --> 25:50.883
She solicited me.

25:50.917 --> 25:53.185
What does this have to do with
the charges against my client?

25:53.219 --> 25:53.986
Everything.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.822
That girl was
only 15 years old.

25:55.855 --> 25:56.823
(Dobbins)
She was drinking

25:56.856 --> 25:58.224
in a bar for God's sake.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.959
She didn't look
like she was 15.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.994
Is that the best
you can come up with?

26:02.028 --> 26:03.863
It was 18 years ago.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.365
I was depressed.
My fiance had just left me.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.834
I was trying to forget--

26:07.867 --> 26:08.835
Mark, stop talking.

26:08.868 --> 26:09.836
No, no, I want

26:09.869 --> 26:12.038
to explain this.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.841
She hit on me.

26:14.874 --> 26:15.975
And then she says
something like

26:16.008 --> 26:19.078
it would be 100 bucks or
something for the night,

26:19.111 --> 26:20.780
and before I could
tell her no,

26:20.813 --> 26:22.348
some drunken cop
on the next barstool

26:22.381 --> 26:25.384
jumps up and slaps
handcuffs on me.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.821
The DA dropped
the charges.

26:28.855 --> 26:31.924
Ten years later,
I'm married, I got a kid,

26:31.958 --> 26:33.993
I got another one
on the way.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.762
My football team wins
the county championship.

26:35.795 --> 26:36.763
I'm in the paper.

26:36.796 --> 26:37.764
The same cop

26:37.797 --> 26:39.666
who busted me sees it.

26:39.699 --> 26:43.302
And he calls the school board.

26:43.335 --> 26:46.038
They fired me on the spot.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.340
And the state
pulled my teaching license.

26:48.374 --> 26:51.243
Well, you don't need a license
to teach at a private school.

26:51.277 --> 26:55.648
Nobody would hire me
because of that arrest.

26:55.682 --> 26:56.548
That letter--

26:56.582 --> 26:58.951
That letter got me my job
at Chestnut.

26:58.985 --> 27:01.120
Well, it was very nice
of the Erie County DA

27:01.153 --> 27:02.621
to write it for you.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.426
You know.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.395
That you forged it?
Yeah.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.866
[sighs]

27:15.467 --> 27:16.669
I, uh--

27:19.739 --> 27:22.074
I had to.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.209
I got screwed then

27:23.242 --> 27:25.878
just like
I'm getting screwed now.

27:25.912 --> 27:29.015
While you're in
the confessing mood,

27:29.048 --> 27:30.082
why don't you
go the distance?

27:30.116 --> 27:31.918
He's innocent.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.353
Don't put Holly,
Nicole, and Danielle

27:34.386 --> 27:36.756
through the trauma
of a trial.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.191
Give Laura Swift's mother
and father a body

27:39.225 --> 27:40.226
to bury.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.067
I didn't murder anyone.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.871
And I didn't abuse
those girls.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.475
I'm gonna make sure the judge
maxes out your sentence

27:56.508 --> 27:58.110
when you're convicted.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.212
I will see you in court.

28:00.246 --> 28:01.981
[cell buzzer]

28:13.325 --> 28:14.827
Hey.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.195
What time is it?

28:16.228 --> 28:18.097
It's five to 8:00.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.799
How'd you know
I was up here?

28:19.832 --> 28:21.100
Well, you didn't
answer your phone

28:21.133 --> 28:22.168
last night or this morning.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.804
We catch a job?
Not yet.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.072
Give me another hour.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.040
No time.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.076
Novak called.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.111
She's prepping Holly
for her swearability hearing.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.946
She wants you there.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.381
What does she need me for?

28:38.484 --> 28:40.052
She wants to make sure

28:40.086 --> 28:43.155
that Holly's comfortable
testifying.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.191
Cover for me, will ya?

28:51.130 --> 28:52.765
Holly asked for you.

28:55.467 --> 28:56.302
I'm done.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.173
You know, running away's
not going to help.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.441
I'm a little too beat

29:02.474 --> 29:07.179
for the dime store shrink
routine right now.

29:07.213 --> 29:10.449
Elliott, that little girl
is counting on you.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.985
You quit on her now,

29:13.019 --> 29:15.487
and you're just another man
that she can't trust.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.059
That's not who you are.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.804
(Holly)
Where is Miss Novak?

29:31.838 --> 29:33.005
(Stabler)
She'll be here soon.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.042
Where do I sit?

29:36.075 --> 29:37.877
That big chair
is for the judge,

29:37.910 --> 29:40.146
and you'll sit right there.

29:40.179 --> 29:43.049
Wanna give it
a try?

29:43.082 --> 29:44.116
Have a seat.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.499
This is scary.

30:00.532 --> 30:01.367
Yeah, a little bit.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.536
I sit up here
all the time, though.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.006
Do they make you swear
to tell the truth?

30:07.039 --> 30:08.607
Yes.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.209
Miss Novak said
the judge is gonna

30:10.242 --> 30:11.410
make me swear
to tell the truth.

30:11.443 --> 30:12.244
First, he's gonna

30:12.278 --> 30:14.213
ask you if you know
the difference

30:14.246 --> 30:18.150
between the truth
and a lie.

30:18.184 --> 30:22.521
And do you get in trouble
if you tell a lie?

30:24.056 --> 30:25.591
Holly, what's the matter?

30:28.995 --> 30:30.329
[crying]
I don't want to do this.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.231
How come?

30:32.264 --> 30:34.901
I don't want
to get in trouble.

30:34.934 --> 30:38.504
Why would you get
in trouble?

30:40.372 --> 30:43.910
I told a lie.

30:43.943 --> 30:47.479
Uncle Mark didn't do
anything to me.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.122
We know Holly was raped.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.256
Why is she recanting?

30:57.289 --> 30:58.324
It happens a lot.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.159
Her Uncle Mark's gone to jail,

31:00.192 --> 31:02.361
she sees her cousins crying,
missing their daddy,

31:02.394 --> 31:04.396
she wants things
the way they used to be.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.898
Think the family's
pressuring her?

31:05.932 --> 31:06.899
Or Mark Dobbins got to her.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.935
If he did, then we got him
for witness tampering.

31:08.968 --> 31:09.936
I'll check
the jail phone records.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.038
We should also talk
to the other two girls.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.473
Way ahead of you.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.608
(Benson)
Are you scared
of something, Nicole?

31:16.642 --> 31:18.945
(Nicole)
I'm scared of Mr. Dobbins.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.446
Why?

31:20.479 --> 31:22.114
He's mad at me
for telling.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.483
Did Mr. Dobbins call you?

31:24.516 --> 31:26.252
No.

31:26.285 --> 31:29.221
Well, then how do you know
he's mad at you?

31:29.255 --> 31:32.224
Because my mom says
he's a very bad man.

31:32.258 --> 31:35.361
(Benson)
Well, what else does your mom
say about Mr. Dobbins?

31:35.394 --> 31:36.195
He hurts little girls,

31:36.228 --> 31:38.497
and I have to help you
put him in jail.

31:40.632 --> 31:43.435
Son of a bitch.

31:43.469 --> 31:44.370
Can I go home now?

31:44.403 --> 31:45.404
[knock at door]

31:47.306 --> 31:50.042
Excuse me, Captain.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.144
Hi, Danielle. Do you remember
me, Detective Stabler?

31:52.178 --> 31:53.545
Hi.
Hi.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.350
I know how hard it is
to talk about what happened.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.086
Uh huh.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.587
Especially having
to remember all the stuff

32:01.620 --> 32:02.588
that you're supposed to say.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.424
Uh huh.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.995
Danielle,
who helps you remember?

32:09.028 --> 32:10.496
My mom.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.499
She keeps
asking me questions.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.401
What questions?

32:15.434 --> 32:17.536
Did Mr. Dobbins touch me,

32:17.569 --> 32:20.072
did he take off my pants...

32:20.106 --> 32:21.273
And what do you tell her?

32:21.307 --> 32:23.009
I told her no.

32:23.042 --> 32:26.545
But she kept asking me
and asking me.

32:26.578 --> 32:29.148
I didn't want her
to be mad.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.450
So I said yes.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.522
Their mothers
are full of crap.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.090
They knew Holly
had been molested

32:38.124 --> 32:39.258
and they badgered
their daughters

32:39.291 --> 32:43.229
into saying they were too.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.131
I've been chasing
a bunch of lies.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.299
We all have been.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.001
No one could've seen
this one coming.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.502
Try telling that
to Dobbins.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.504
It's his life and reputation
that've been shot to hell.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.006
He didn't do a damn thing.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.475
Holly, Nicole, and Danielle
all named Dobbins.

32:56.508 --> 32:59.745
Their stories matched.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.014
I bought into the hysteria.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.282
Hysteria is like a disease.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.483
It's contagious.

33:04.516 --> 33:05.484
And the guy who raped Holly

33:05.517 --> 33:06.418
is still out there.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.587
Captain, we gotta spring
Dobbins from Rikers.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.588
Call Novak.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.090
Get her into night court.

33:15.294 --> 33:17.596
(Novak)
In light of this new
information, Your Honor,

33:17.629 --> 33:19.131
the People request
that the indictment

33:19.165 --> 33:20.399
against the defendant,
Mark Dobbins,

33:20.432 --> 33:22.601
be dismissed
in the interest of justice.

33:22.634 --> 33:25.437
Mr. Langdon,

33:25.471 --> 33:26.538
anything for the record?

33:26.572 --> 33:29.208
Just that we're stunned
that people charged my client

33:29.241 --> 33:32.111
with these heinous crimes
without proper investigation.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.412
(Judge)
Mr. Dobbins,

33:33.445 --> 33:36.282
the court offers you
its sincerest apologies

33:36.315 --> 33:38.284
for putting you through
this terrible ordeal.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.485
I'm dismissing
the indictment.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.487
You are free to go.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.788
And we're adjourned.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.290
[bangs gavel]

33:44.323 --> 33:45.524
Thank you.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.201
Mark--
[clears throat]

33:55.234 --> 33:56.235
Julie.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.808
I-I don't know
what to say.

34:02.841 --> 34:06.512
How long have we known
each other, Larry?

34:06.545 --> 34:08.547
Holly's like my own daughter.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.283
I didn't believe it
at first, I swear.

34:11.317 --> 34:16.288
How could you think I would do
those awful things to her?

34:16.322 --> 34:18.757
She was abused!

34:18.790 --> 34:21.693
Someone hurt my little girl.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.795
When those two other girls
said it was you,

34:23.829 --> 34:27.433
what was I supposed
to think, Mark?

34:27.466 --> 34:31.137
We just wanna get back
to our lives.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.838
Let's go.
Come on, sweetheart.

34:39.345 --> 34:40.746
They're never
gonna forgive us.

34:42.914 --> 34:46.152
We helped spread
the poison.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.788
You told
those other girls' parents

34:49.821 --> 34:53.692
what happened to Holly?

34:53.725 --> 34:56.728
My wife.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.598
Yes, I called their mothers
to warn them.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.733
I thought I was
doing the right thing.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.502
There's no question your
daughter was molested,

35:03.535 --> 35:04.603
but Mark Dobbins
didn't do it.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.638
Well, then why did Holly
accuse him?

35:06.672 --> 35:09.508
Because she's so afraid
of her abuser,

35:09.541 --> 35:11.143
she named the safest target.

35:11.177 --> 35:14.346
Holly, you have
to tell us the truth.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.414
Who hurt you?

35:15.447 --> 35:16.782
He'll kill me.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.917
He won't if you tell us
who he is.

35:18.950 --> 35:19.918
Detective Stabler

35:19.951 --> 35:21.587
will put him in jail.
No!

35:21.620 --> 35:23.455
He said he'd sneak out
and come to our house

35:23.489 --> 35:25.757
when we're sleeping.

35:25.791 --> 35:29.761
He said he'd shoot
me and you.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.363
And Mom.

35:31.397 --> 35:32.598
Holly, it's okay.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.333
It's okay.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.235
Mrs. Purcell,
why don't you go take Holly

35:36.268 --> 35:37.836
and get something
to drink?

35:37.869 --> 35:39.871
Come on, sweetheart.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.616
[sighs]
Now what?

35:50.649 --> 35:54.286
I think you should take Holly
out of town for a few days.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.687
You really think this guy's
gonna hurt her?

35:55.721 --> 35:57.456
Holly does.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.525
And that's not gonna change
until he's arrested.

35:59.558 --> 36:00.692
How?

36:00.726 --> 36:03.529
When you don't even know
who he is?

36:03.562 --> 36:05.731
Sending Holly out of town
isn't gonna stop this guy

36:05.764 --> 36:06.832
from molesting
another kid.
Or killing one.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.734
But it's the only way for her
to feel safe again,

36:08.767 --> 36:10.702
which just might
help her open up.

36:10.736 --> 36:11.637
We just don't
have that time.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.472
We've gotta get
inside of her head now.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.474
Gimme those drawings.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.976
The ones Holly did for me.

36:18.009 --> 36:21.313
(Stabler)
What are you looking for?

36:21.347 --> 36:22.714
Maybe she already told us.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.750
these drawings depict
Holly's inner life.

36:24.783 --> 36:27.619
See in this one she drew herself
without hands.

36:27.653 --> 36:30.256
Feels powerless,
disconnected from her parents.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.558
She doesn't want them
to know about the abuse.

36:32.591 --> 36:33.759
This is Holly's bedroom.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.461
Why is that the only one
that's blacked out?

36:35.494 --> 36:37.363
She doesn't want anyone
to see inside.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.530
She feels ashamed.

36:38.564 --> 36:39.765
And this one,
all these kids are playing

36:39.798 --> 36:40.799
here together
and Holly's standing

36:40.832 --> 36:42.834
over here by this big guy.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.504
Who she identified
as her abuser.

36:46.672 --> 36:47.773
Oh, no.

36:47.806 --> 36:48.574
What?

36:48.607 --> 36:51.410
I assumed that
was Mark Dobbins,

36:51.443 --> 36:52.978
because I accepted
what Holly told me

36:53.011 --> 36:53.979
without even considering

36:54.012 --> 36:55.814
it could've been
someone else.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.783
Well, you're not the only one
who jumped on that train.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.851
Well, she was telling us
who abused her.

36:59.885 --> 37:00.986
Look what he's wearing,

37:01.019 --> 37:02.788
a maroon and white jersey.

37:02.821 --> 37:03.822
Coaches don't wear those.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.023
But students do.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.492
Maybe our perp's
a football player.

37:06.525 --> 37:07.693
(Stabler)
That's not a football uniform.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.861
That's more like
a rugby jersey.

37:09.895 --> 37:13.465
With a yellow stripe
on the sleeve.

37:13.499 --> 37:15.967
(Hendrix)
I want to apologize
to you, Holly.

37:16.001 --> 37:19.037
You were trying so hard
to tell us,

37:19.070 --> 37:21.807
and we just didn't
understand.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.410
Holly, we looked
at your pictures again.

37:24.443 --> 37:27.946
Now, remember the one that you
drew of the soccer game?

37:27.979 --> 37:29.348
(Stabler)
Excuse me.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.816
'Scuse me.
Talk to you a second?

37:30.849 --> 37:31.850
Yeah, hey, what's up?

37:31.883 --> 37:32.851
How are you?

37:32.884 --> 37:35.554
Me?
I'm good.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.755
That yellow stripe
on your sleeve--

37:36.788 --> 37:38.424
I don't see it on the other
guys' uniforms.

37:38.457 --> 37:39.491
I'm team captain,

37:39.525 --> 37:41.460
so I'm the only one
who has it.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.698
I thought this
was your Uncle Mark.

37:46.732 --> 37:47.699
But it isn't.

37:47.733 --> 37:51.737
It's a Lacrosse player.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.873
I know because of the shirt
that he's wearing.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.708
The other day when you were
watching the fourth grade

37:56.742 --> 37:58.076
girls play soccer,

37:58.109 --> 37:59.645
I didn't catch your name.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.614
Kevin Wilcox
and I wasn't watching them.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.383
I was practicing.

38:04.416 --> 38:05.751
(Benson)
I also know who he is.

38:05.784 --> 38:09.588
Detective Stabler is going
to arrest him

38:09.621 --> 38:10.589
and put him in jail.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.424
And if you tell me his name,

38:12.458 --> 38:14.960
he's never ever
gonna get out.

38:20.399 --> 38:21.900
You were practicing
or fantasizing?

38:21.933 --> 38:24.636
What are you talking about?

38:24.670 --> 38:26.905
Holly Purcell.

38:26.938 --> 38:29.808
She drew you.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.777
Picture's worth
1,000 words, huh?

38:31.810 --> 38:34.846
Please, I need you
to tell me his name.

38:46.392 --> 38:48.960
Kevin Wilcox.

38:49.595 --> 38:50.996
Kevin.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.464
You're toast.

38:52.498 --> 38:53.699
Holly Purcell just ID'd you

38:53.732 --> 38:54.766
as her attacker.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.934
Last week she said
it was Coach D.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.003
That girl can't keep
her story straight.
That's because

38:58.036 --> 38:59.505
you scared the crap out of her

38:59.538 --> 39:00.772
when you threatened her
with your gun.

39:00.806 --> 39:01.807
I don't own a gun.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.709
(Fin)
What do you call that?
Not mine.

39:03.742 --> 39:04.810
That's funny, I found that

39:04.843 --> 39:06.845
under the spare tire
in your car.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.380
Well, I don't know
how that got there.

39:08.414 --> 39:09.381
(Stabler)
I do.

39:09.415 --> 39:10.382
Trunk's your secret

39:10.416 --> 39:11.383
hiding place.

39:11.417 --> 39:12.484
That's where you
keep your gun

39:12.518 --> 39:13.752
and the little girls
you shoot with it.

39:13.785 --> 39:14.820
I didn't shoot anyone.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.422
Yeah, you did.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.023
Laura Swift.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.057
Who?

39:19.090 --> 39:19.858
(Fin)
You left a shell

39:19.891 --> 39:22.027
casing in
the boathouse, genius.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.630
Lab matched the tool marks
from the firing pin

39:24.663 --> 39:25.864
to that gun right there.

39:25.897 --> 39:28.434
And then there's the other
problem with your car.

39:28.467 --> 39:29.801
You know, you think
your trunk is clean,

39:29.835 --> 39:31.437
but no matter
how hard you scrub,

39:31.470 --> 39:32.971
we come along
with a little bit of luminol

39:33.004 --> 39:36.007
and all those blood spots
that you missed--

39:36.041 --> 39:37.375
they light right up.

39:38.910 --> 39:39.878
You--you're bluffing.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.112
You're dead meat, punk.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.514
(Stabler)
You're a child molester.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.516
You're the bottom
of the food chain in prison.

39:44.550 --> 39:45.984
How long you think it's gonna
take his fellow cons

39:46.017 --> 39:47.786
to find out
he's a baby raper?

39:47.819 --> 39:49.187
I make a few calls.
A week, tops.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.188
You can't do that.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.056
Who's gonna know?

39:51.089 --> 39:54.693
They're gonna rip
your cherry ass apart.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.463
Unless you tell us
where you buried Laura Swift.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.503
(Benson)
Hey.

40:04.536 --> 40:05.504
Wilcox give it up?

40:05.537 --> 40:06.738
Copped to raping Holly.

40:06.772 --> 40:08.907
Said he buried Laura Swift
in a vacant lot

40:08.940 --> 40:09.908
in College Point.

40:09.941 --> 40:10.942
I'm going there now.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.815
I'm going home.

40:16.848 --> 40:17.816
Why don't you stop

40:17.849 --> 40:18.984
at your desk first?

40:27.058 --> 40:29.461
Happy Birthday, Dad.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.966
Think you got
enough candles on that cake?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.903
We always have a cake.

40:37.936 --> 40:38.904
Olivia called

40:38.937 --> 40:40.171
and said you'd be here.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.540
Mom lent me the car.

40:41.573 --> 40:42.941
How's she doing?

40:42.974 --> 40:45.043
Okay.
How 'bout you?

40:45.076 --> 40:46.645
Great.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.079
You have to make a wish.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.648
'Course I do.

40:53.619 --> 40:56.021
I'll be right back.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.055
Mr. and Mrs. Dobbins--

40:57.088 --> 40:59.691
Please.
Don't.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.960
Chestnut Academy
fired me.

41:01.993 --> 41:05.096
They said forging that letter
damaged my integrity.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.032
Set a bad example

41:07.065 --> 41:08.834
for the students.

41:08.867 --> 41:11.136
I'll never get
another teaching job.

41:11.169 --> 41:11.937
We're selling the house,

41:11.970 --> 41:14.105
moving in
with my parents upstate.

41:15.807 --> 41:16.975
I'm sorry.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.144
I wish none of this
had ever happened.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.747
Me too.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.062
[whispers]
Your kids are waiting.

41:44.235 --> 41:46.037
C'mere.

41:46.071 --> 41:46.137
