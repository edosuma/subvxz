WEBVTT

00:02.254 --> 00:03.183
That you?

00:03.303 --> 00:04.598
Sally Wheet.

00:04.718 --> 00:07.827
So how does a not so smart,
semi-dangerous man

00:07.947 --> 00:09.238
run the rackets down in Tampa?

00:09.358 --> 00:11.583
You can do pretty much anything down here.

00:12.784 --> 00:13.961
This a pretty girl.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.254
May I present Miss Daughter Maitland.

00:16.375 --> 00:17.881
Pleased to meet you.

00:18.001 --> 00:20.836
I think you'll find us
to be responsible partners

00:20.956 --> 00:22.462
both here or in Florida.

00:22.582 --> 00:24.830
I'll have $100,000 in 48 hours.

00:24.950 --> 00:26.502
- Done.
- The money doesn't show.

00:26.622 --> 00:28.066
This conversation didn't happen.

00:28.186 --> 00:31.290
You agreed to take on a certain job
which you didn't finish.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.410
You need to call yourself to account.

00:36.107 --> 00:38.100
Take this.
This is only money.

00:38.220 --> 00:39.764
Doesn't mean anything.

00:39.884 --> 00:41.157
Yes, it does.

00:42.686 --> 00:44.466
Open up a safety deposit box.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.785
- In whose name?
- Make it yours.

00:46.905 --> 00:48.739
Your boys, Conrad and Lucas

00:48.859 --> 00:50.229
changed their last name

00:50.349 --> 00:51.932
to escape the shame of their father's

00:52.052 --> 00:53.500
lies brought upon them.

00:53.620 --> 00:57.311
Tell us one thing, one little thing,
and we're done for today.

00:57.756 --> 01:02.617
Ralph Capone, that was the man
I gave the money to.

01:02.881 --> 01:04.289
- Why?
- Because...

01:04.409 --> 01:08.555
that is what Nucky told me to do.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074

<i>Is something wrong, sir?</i>

03:19.822 --> 03:21.021
Beg pardon?

03:21.054 --> 03:22.893
Is something wrong
with the coffee?

03:22.926 --> 03:24.358
I can pour you fresh.

03:24.391 --> 03:27.297
No, it's just--
look at that.

03:27.330 --> 03:29.668
<i>We're over the tracks.</i>

03:29.701 --> 03:32.007
Every time a train departs...

03:32.040 --> 03:33.944
Never noticed before.

03:33.977 --> 03:37.913
You go your whole life with
things right under your nose.

03:43.663 --> 03:45.964
Can I bring you anything else?

03:45.997 --> 03:49.099
I'm fine with
the cinnamon roll.

03:50.236 --> 03:52.603
<i>Now boarding at track 29</i>

03:52.636 --> 03:55.235
<i>Pennsylvania</i>
<i>Railroad Broadway Limited</i>

03:55.268 --> 03:57.003
<i>with service to Chicago,</i>

03:57.036 --> 04:01.407
<i>with stops at Newark Penn
Station, North Philadelphia,</i>

04:01.440 --> 04:03.945
<i>Harrisburg,</i>
<i>Baker Street Station...</i>

04:03.978 --> 04:06.180
Oh, he's right over there.

04:21.968 --> 04:24.237
Well...

04:24.270 --> 04:26.467
I'm going to sit.

04:37.180 --> 04:38.717
Can I order you something?

04:38.750 --> 04:40.749
I don't really have time.

04:40.790 --> 04:42.086
The IRT was hopeless.

04:42.119 --> 04:45.191
- The what?
- <i>The subway.</i>

04:48.033 --> 04:49.928
<i>Where were you coming from?</i>

04:49.969 --> 04:51.664
Downtown.

04:51.697 --> 04:53.601
That's where you work?

04:55.442 --> 04:57.169
Is that a cinnamon roll?

04:57.210 --> 04:58.810
Have some.

04:58.843 --> 05:00.747
You don't like cinnamon.

05:01.685 --> 05:04.182
No, I hate it.

05:04.215 --> 05:06.390
The woman who was
sitting over there--

05:06.423 --> 05:07.790
well, she's gone now.

05:07.823 --> 05:08.854
She ordered one.

05:08.887 --> 05:11.094
For some reason,
I got a craving and...

05:12.096 --> 05:14.232
Why am I telling you this?

05:15.129 --> 05:16.936
I don't know.

05:16.969 --> 05:19.473
You're not going to say
where you work?

05:21.202 --> 05:23.242
In an office.

05:23.275 --> 05:26.884
That sounds mysterious.

05:29.015 --> 05:31.917
You're traveling to Florida.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.849
But I'm supposed to tell you.

05:33.882 --> 05:36.785
You already did
when you called.

05:36.818 --> 05:38.395
Really?

05:38.428 --> 05:41.132
I must be slipping.
What else did I say?

05:41.165 --> 05:44.959
That you would be in the
restaurant in Pennsylvania Station

05:44.992 --> 05:48.370
and that there was something
you thought I'd want to know.

05:51.539 --> 05:53.475
Eddie Kessler's gone.

05:53.508 --> 05:56.106
He left your service?

06:00.716 --> 06:02.148
Oh.

06:02.181 --> 06:04.989
I brought this for Teddy.

06:06.024 --> 06:07.857
You-- what?

06:07.898 --> 06:09.929
His birthday.
I know it's late.

06:09.962 --> 06:11.762
What about Mr. Kessler?

06:11.803 --> 06:16.205
- It doesn't matter.
- <i>You came here to tell me.</i>

06:16.238 --> 06:18.610
I just thought you should
hear it from me.

06:18.650 --> 06:19.980
He--

06:21.390 --> 06:24.325
I don't know why,
but he--

06:28.760 --> 06:31.297
I'm working now.

06:31.338 --> 06:32.771
It's a good job.

06:32.804 --> 06:34.572
<i>The children are in school.</i>

06:34.605 --> 06:36.244
<i>Emily's doing well.</i>

06:36.277 --> 06:38.380
I--

06:41.086 --> 06:43.656
- Whatever happened to Mr.--
- Look, I just figured--

06:43.689 --> 06:45.721
- I don't mean to be callous.
- Three hours between trains--

06:45.754 --> 06:48.486
You can't turn up
and tell me things like this.

06:48.527 --> 06:50.021
<i>Don't you see that?</i>

06:50.061 --> 06:51.725
The things that go on
in your business

06:51.758 --> 06:53.559
as if it's a normal--

06:57.574 --> 06:59.575
I work.

06:59.608 --> 07:01.844
I pay my brother rent.

07:03.012 --> 07:05.145
A picture at the Loew's Kings

07:05.178 --> 07:07.980
Friday nights
if I can stay awake.

07:08.013 --> 07:10.287
I'm trying to get on with it.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.224
<i>Do you understand?</i>

07:13.257 --> 07:16.021
Will you give this to Teddy?

07:18.559 --> 07:21.137
It's not some sort
of creature, is it?

07:21.170 --> 07:22.603
We haven't the room.

07:22.636 --> 07:26.105
I wouldn't put something
alive in a box.

07:30.342 --> 07:31.942
Don't worry about it.
I'll send--

07:31.975 --> 07:34.281
No.

07:34.314 --> 07:36.353
Thank you.

07:42.723 --> 07:45.228
- I--
- Have to get back to work.

07:45.261 --> 07:46.935
Yes.

07:55.744 --> 07:58.207
I really am sorry.

07:58.248 --> 08:01.447
No one knew how to look
after you like Mr. Kessler.

08:21.601 --> 08:24.935
<i>So either he jumped
or someone pushed him.</i>

08:24.976 --> 08:28.008
I'm working from the
assumption that he jumped.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.609
You are?

08:29.650 --> 08:32.113
And if he talked
to Thompson beforehand?

08:32.145 --> 08:33.616
Blew your cover?

08:33.650 --> 08:35.418
It could be you
going out a window.

08:35.451 --> 08:37.523
<i>Or worse.</i>

08:37.556 --> 08:39.028
Those are the risks one takes.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.996
<i>Not if they can be avoided.</i>

08:41.030 --> 08:44.227
Stop spinning in circles, Jim.

08:44.260 --> 08:46.130
Your informant is dead.

08:46.163 --> 08:48.330
The operation is compromised.

08:48.363 --> 08:49.666
This is months of work,

08:49.699 --> 08:51.905
hundreds, if not
thousands of man-hours.

08:51.938 --> 08:55.610
It was a noble cause,
and I applaud your efforts.

08:55.643 --> 08:57.474
At least do me the favor
of not pretending

08:57.507 --> 08:59.074
you were ever
on board with this.

08:59.107 --> 09:01.809
A nationwide network
of organized criminals--

09:01.842 --> 09:03.542
It's real, Edgar.

09:03.575 --> 09:07.214
Cyril Briggs, Marcus Garvey,

09:07.247 --> 09:10.254
<i>Emma Goldman--</i>
<i>anarchists,</i>

09:10.287 --> 09:13.188
political agitators--
that's real.

09:13.221 --> 09:17.016
<i>That's where the Bureau needs
to be putting its resources.</i>

09:17.049 --> 09:19.120
Give me one more chance.

09:19.153 --> 09:22.564
Let me poke my head up,
see how the Thompsons react.

09:22.629 --> 09:25.831
And if they blow it
off your shoulders?

09:27.397 --> 09:30.941
You'll have the satisfaction
of knowing you were right.

09:56.164 --> 09:59.932
Come on.
Nothing's gonna bite you.

10:05.336 --> 10:07.135
Ugh.

10:07.168 --> 10:09.304
He lived here?

10:15.347 --> 10:17.711
If this was my room,
I'd kill myself.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.551
Oh, I didn't mean--

10:20.584 --> 10:22.120
fuck it, he can't hear me.

10:30.329 --> 10:32.724
What are we looking for?

10:32.757 --> 10:35.093
Safety-deposit key.

10:35.126 --> 10:37.334
Nothing gonna be in that box.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.799
How's that?

10:38.832 --> 10:40.965
Why else would
he taken a header?

10:40.998 --> 10:43.300
<i>Just would have left</i>
<i>with the money.</i>

10:43.333 --> 10:45.604
Guilty conscience.

10:45.637 --> 10:48.309
You know all about it.

10:48.342 --> 10:50.341
Check the suit.

10:52.879 --> 10:55.548
Oof.

10:55.581 --> 10:57.849
- Look in the pockets.
- Mm-mm.

10:57.882 --> 10:59.682
Go on.

11:06.292 --> 11:07.689
What is it?

11:08.824 --> 11:11.158
"Business dinner
with R. Capone."

11:11.191 --> 11:13.758
He kept receipts.

11:18.336 --> 11:20.667
I didn't know that.

11:20.700 --> 11:23.870
- What?
- He had kids?

11:23.903 --> 11:26.039
Maybe they're not his.

11:36.383 --> 11:38.519
What's this?

11:43.357 --> 11:46.289
- It's German.
- You can read it?

11:46.322 --> 11:48.196
"Dear everybody,

11:48.229 --> 11:50.196
I stole the money
and jumped out the window.

11:50.229 --> 11:51.627
I am bad.

11:51.660 --> 11:55.034
Also, $1.09
for stationery."

11:57.836 --> 12:00.077
I don't know any German.

12:14.757 --> 12:16.690
Here you go.

12:37.504 --> 12:39.437
<i>New pianist?</i>

12:45.078 --> 12:46.549
My son.

12:48.448 --> 12:50.385
<i>You let him
sit with the help?</i>

12:50.418 --> 12:53.919
I thought you all slept
through the afternoon.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.624
<i>Mr. Coates and I are working</i>
<i>on something new.</i>

12:59.034 --> 13:00.636
First I hear about it.

13:01.838 --> 13:03.837
Am I supposed to clear
my set with you?

13:03.871 --> 13:06.974
The people come
expecting the one thing.

13:07.007 --> 13:08.910
Isn't that what I'm giving you?

13:08.943 --> 13:10.912
Then why you looking
to do something else?

13:10.953 --> 13:13.123
Maybe I'm bored.

13:13.156 --> 13:16.092
Don't you ever feel bored?

13:16.157 --> 13:19.658
If I do, I keep it to myself.

13:24.231 --> 13:27.397
That doesn't stop you
from feeling it.

13:34.842 --> 13:37.041
What's your pleasure, Miss D?

13:37.074 --> 13:40.177
Hmm...
"Malinda Brown."

13:40.210 --> 13:41.984
Woman, that's a Sunday stroll.

13:42.017 --> 13:45.615
Well, we don't
want to wake anyone up.

13:45.647 --> 13:47.319
<i>I know how it goes.</i>

13:49.955 --> 13:53.194
♪ There's a little dusky lady ♪

13:53.227 --> 13:55.930
♪ In the land

13:59.500 --> 14:02.911

14:07.784 --> 14:09.614
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

14:15.591 --> 14:17.757
Your eyes are
a little jaundiced.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.093
Show me your hands.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.596
Palms up.

14:26.261 --> 14:29.934
These spots, erythema.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.672
That's from working
in the yard.

14:33.705 --> 14:35.681
Over.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.112
Feeling tired?

14:39.145 --> 14:40.952
Right now?

14:40.985 --> 14:42.552
Generally.

14:42.585 --> 14:44.553
Yeah, some.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.354
Bruising easily?

14:46.387 --> 14:48.763
Itchy skin?
Really itchy?

14:48.797 --> 14:50.561
All that.

14:50.594 --> 14:53.663
How much you drinking?

14:55.000 --> 14:58.200
See, now I promised
my daughter--

14:58.233 --> 15:01.105
Oh, I promise my kids
lots of things.

15:01.138 --> 15:03.239
I try to stick to them.

15:03.272 --> 15:05.272
But...

15:05.305 --> 15:07.443
how much?

15:08.813 --> 15:11.116
Last eight months,
nothing before dinner.

15:11.149 --> 15:13.618
That's what I told her
and I stuck to it.

15:14.986 --> 15:16.819
On account of the boy.

15:16.852 --> 15:19.028
<i>And before that?</i>

15:20.062 --> 15:21.462
I'm no saint.

15:21.495 --> 15:24.931
When did you start
consuming alcohol?

15:26.565 --> 15:29.670
<i>In my life?</i>

15:29.703 --> 15:31.837
14.

15:35.845 --> 15:37.937
Look, I'll stop.

15:38.946 --> 15:40.913
I'll stop today.

15:40.946 --> 15:43.514
Nothing after dinner.

15:43.547 --> 15:45.883
It's not so hard.

15:46.916 --> 15:49.418
This is from working.

15:55.896 --> 15:59.366
All right, I'm gonna tell you
the things that can be done

15:59.399 --> 16:02.931
and the thing you should
be preparing yourself for.

16:35.140 --> 16:37.348
Richard?

16:37.381 --> 16:39.284
Hold on.

16:39.317 --> 16:42.021
Hey, Richard.
Hold on.

16:42.054 --> 16:44.357
Come back!

16:45.589 --> 16:47.620
Richard, I need to talk to you.

16:51.326 --> 16:53.532
Oh!

16:57.869 --> 17:00.003
Are you all right?

17:03.677 --> 17:05.604
I'm dying.

17:06.645 --> 17:08.244
Right now?

17:09.214 --> 17:10.679
Christ.

17:10.719 --> 17:12.516
I don't know.

17:17.122 --> 17:19.857
<i>If you'll give me
a moment, Mr. Kessler.</i>

17:21.561 --> 17:23.834
I'll be back straightaway.

17:27.775 --> 17:30.539
Oh, may I offer you
some coffee?

17:30.572 --> 17:32.210
No.

17:32.243 --> 17:33.872
Thank you.

17:57.431 --> 17:59.733
- Eli.
- John.

17:59.766 --> 18:02.267
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

18:04.901 --> 18:08.141
Eddie, my brother's man.

18:08.207 --> 18:10.476
Kessler.

18:10.509 --> 18:12.842
He passed suddenly
a few days ago.

18:12.875 --> 18:15.516
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

18:17.551 --> 18:20.552
Nucky gave him
some important papers.

18:20.592 --> 18:22.390
Documents to put
in the safety-depo--

18:22.423 --> 18:24.220
I'll need a death
certificate for starters.

18:24.253 --> 18:25.693
Okay, fine.
I can get that.

18:25.726 --> 18:27.325
<i>As well as some legal authority</i>

18:27.358 --> 18:30.125
<i>permitting you</i>
<i>access to the box.</i>

18:31.631 --> 18:34.637
- Like what?
- A last will and testament naming you--

18:34.670 --> 18:37.069
It was sudden, like I said.

18:37.102 --> 18:39.572
- He didn't have a will.
- A letter, then?

18:39.605 --> 18:41.204
A court order?

18:42.774 --> 18:44.940
I've got the key right here.

18:44.973 --> 18:47.810
- I have a fiduciary duty--
- Cut the crap, will you?

18:47.843 --> 18:49.514
We got a right
to what's in the box.

18:49.548 --> 18:53.020
I'm sorry, Eli. Absent the
proper legal authorization,

18:53.053 --> 18:54.621
there is nothing I can do.

18:54.654 --> 18:58.055
I was sheriff for nine
goddamn years, John.

19:00.097 --> 19:03.167
I could go to jail.
We both could.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.462
You don't want
that again, do you?

19:12.641 --> 19:14.239
<i>It may seem frivolous,</i>

19:14.280 --> 19:16.973
but it's actually
very sophisticated.

19:17.014 --> 19:19.412
It sounds like a lot
of banging to me.

19:19.445 --> 19:21.077
You have to know
what to listen for.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.552
He's about the best there is.

19:22.585 --> 19:25.022
- Isn't that so, Father?
- He keep the rhythm going.

19:25.055 --> 19:27.790
<i>This man, Mother, was playing
serial thirds like...</i>

19:27.823 --> 19:29.454
It's stride piano and he's...

19:29.496 --> 19:31.761
Well, can't he perform
at the reception, Daddy?

19:31.794 --> 19:34.330
It's up to your mama.

19:35.530 --> 19:38.066
Something for
our friends, at least?

19:38.106 --> 19:40.306
I think the setting
will be unusual enough

19:40.339 --> 19:42.443
for our guests
without becoming primitive.

19:42.476 --> 19:44.779
Play some now.

19:44.813 --> 19:46.918
We're still eating, Addy.

19:46.951 --> 19:49.718
- We're done.
- It's your mama table.

19:49.751 --> 19:53.052
May we be excused?
Please?

19:53.085 --> 19:54.923
You may.

19:57.429 --> 19:59.095
Hey, serial thirds.

19:59.128 --> 20:01.096
I'm not promising nothing.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.577
I wish you hadn't
taken him 'round.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.043
Ain't done no harm.

20:12.084 --> 20:14.115
<i>It puts ideas in his head.</i>

20:14.148 --> 20:16.018
The way he goes on about it.

20:16.051 --> 20:18.786
Is that what you want?

20:21.658 --> 20:24.225
What it matter what I want?

20:49.020 --> 20:50.651
You gonna say anything?

20:52.220 --> 20:55.459
I couldn't face any of you.

20:55.491 --> 20:57.194
<i>Why not?</i>

20:57.227 --> 20:59.930
You don't think
I know what you did?

20:59.963 --> 21:02.098
You think she don't know?

21:06.372 --> 21:09.075
I killed those men, Paul.

21:10.574 --> 21:11.677
Every one of them.

21:11.710 --> 21:14.107
And you got Tommy
out of that house.

21:14.180 --> 21:16.210
That makes you a hero.

21:17.613 --> 21:20.317
I've done other things.

21:22.918 --> 21:24.651
How many?

21:26.725 --> 21:28.831
I've stopped counting.

21:31.539 --> 21:35.373
In the Philippines,
there was this girl.

21:36.740 --> 21:39.907
She couldn't have been
more than 13.

21:39.948 --> 21:42.348
She was walking down the road,

21:42.381 --> 21:43.780
forest on either side.

21:43.813 --> 21:45.786
You couldn't see
more than 10 feet in.

21:45.819 --> 21:50.323
She had a tarsier
around her shoulder.

21:50.356 --> 21:55.198
Sort of like a little monkey
crossed with a mouse.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.027
"Where you going, miss?"

21:59.068 --> 22:00.764
"To my village."

22:00.797 --> 22:03.004
<i>"I need to see</i>
<i>some identification."</i>

22:03.037 --> 22:04.972
They had to, you understand me?

22:05.005 --> 22:07.172
Those orders came
straight from the top.

22:09.876 --> 22:14.377
She said, "I am who I am.

22:14.410 --> 22:17.176
Who else could I be?"

22:19.113 --> 22:21.756
<i>I am who I am.</i>

22:23.989 --> 22:26.859
I put a bullet
through her face.

22:29.892 --> 22:32.193
Came home...

22:32.226 --> 22:34.928
met my wife, two kids.

22:48.379 --> 22:50.715
I got fucking cirrhosis.

22:52.683 --> 22:55.185
<i>You know what that is?</i>

22:56.258 --> 22:58.658
A year from now, I'll be gone.

22:58.691 --> 23:01.292
You'll still be here.

23:01.325 --> 23:04.132
You came home.
You know why you did that.

23:04.165 --> 23:07.604
<i>The rest is bullshit</i>
<i>and I don't want to hear it.</i>

23:07.637 --> 23:10.540
Buy me another round.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.555
You're awake.

23:27.756 --> 23:30.386
So are you.

23:30.427 --> 23:33.228
You keep flopping around.

23:37.766 --> 23:40.165
I'll sleep downstairs.

23:41.701 --> 23:43.833
Take a blanket.

23:52.008 --> 23:54.206
What?

23:59.379 --> 24:02.181
Maybe I should
drive up there, hmm?

24:03.351 --> 24:05.421
Drive where?

24:05.454 --> 24:07.923
Philadelphia.

24:07.956 --> 24:09.354
Check in on Will.

24:09.387 --> 24:12.723
This business
with his roommate...

24:12.756 --> 24:15.364
It's the middle of the night.

24:15.397 --> 24:17.531
Tomorrow.

24:19.932 --> 24:22.571
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

24:24.070 --> 24:26.077
Why not?

24:27.342 --> 24:29.875
He'll think you're prying.

24:29.908 --> 24:32.010
He's my son.

24:32.043 --> 24:34.610
Who said he wasn't?

24:38.085 --> 24:41.219
He'll talk
when he wants to talk.

24:50.696 --> 24:53.431
You know anybody
who speaks German?

25:04.380 --> 25:07.346
Anyway, I'm sorry about Eli.

25:07.379 --> 25:09.618
<i>Just an awful thing to hear.</i>

25:09.651 --> 25:11.282
Eddie.

25:12.187 --> 25:13.817
Not your brother?

25:13.850 --> 25:15.584
Eddie.

25:15.617 --> 25:17.886
Eddie.
He works for me.

25:17.919 --> 25:20.254
Oh, right.
The little--

25:21.487 --> 25:23.098
I never really knew him.

25:23.131 --> 25:26.525
But tough break.

25:26.558 --> 25:28.292
Yeah.

25:28.333 --> 25:32.192
Look, before your partners
show up...

25:33.530 --> 25:36.299
not a big deal and I don't
want you to worry...

25:36.340 --> 25:38.707
Bill McCoy.

25:38.740 --> 25:41.001
Cal. Hey.

25:41.042 --> 25:42.672
<i>Earl.</i>

25:42.705 --> 25:44.873
You keeping yourself scarce.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.748
Something we can
help you with, friend?

25:47.781 --> 25:50.422
What's the news
with Augie Tucker?

25:50.455 --> 25:53.880
Cal, nobody's
more concerned than me.

25:55.386 --> 25:57.658
Is there a problem?

25:57.691 --> 26:00.595
- I was just explaining--
- Oh, yeah?

26:00.628 --> 26:03.331
I want to hear it.

26:04.395 --> 26:05.992
He took off.

26:06.033 --> 26:07.864
A few weeks ago.

26:07.897 --> 26:11.738
I don't know why.
I thought we had a deal and--

26:11.771 --> 26:14.307
And he ain't been seen since.

26:15.643 --> 26:17.777
But you still around,
ain't you?

26:17.810 --> 26:19.745
Now, you wanna
think about that.

26:19.778 --> 26:21.849
There's a lot more of us.

26:21.882 --> 26:23.819
I could make it two less.

26:28.584 --> 26:30.720
Well?

26:43.469 --> 26:45.405
What the hell?

26:45.478 --> 26:48.708
I was trying to tell you.
Tucker lammed it.

26:48.741 --> 26:49.877
Something dirty.
Who knows?

26:49.910 --> 26:51.077
You see how these people are.

26:51.118 --> 26:52.548
I wouldn't even
be here if you--

26:52.582 --> 26:54.949
This is a blessing in disguise.

26:54.982 --> 26:58.187
- We're short an investor.
- I've got a fella.

26:58.220 --> 27:00.353
- Christ, Bill.
- I do.

27:00.386 --> 27:03.185
Gold plated.
Name's Pierce.

27:03.226 --> 27:05.024
Cash in hand and plenty of it.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.455
- I come 1,000 miles--
- Hear me out.

27:07.488 --> 27:09.828
This man, he's from up north.

27:09.869 --> 27:13.637
Very discreet.
Connections in Havana.

27:13.670 --> 27:16.467
He has a vision
for what this could all be

27:16.508 --> 27:18.905
in a year, 10 years.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.906
Why didn't you go to him first?

27:20.939 --> 27:23.045
You have to wait

27:23.078 --> 27:25.382
for him to come to you.

27:25.415 --> 27:26.949
And he did.

27:26.982 --> 27:29.187
Forget Tucker.

27:29.220 --> 27:32.651
I don't want anything
except for us to be square.

27:32.692 --> 27:34.725
I'll meet him.

27:34.758 --> 27:37.725
- I promise, you won't--
- I'll meet him, Bill.

27:37.766 --> 27:39.963
That's all I'm agreeing to.

27:44.470 --> 27:46.640
I do apologize
for the disturbance.

27:46.673 --> 27:49.942
That's as good
as a box of chocolates.

27:49.975 --> 27:51.942
I'll send you one if you like.

27:53.016 --> 27:54.647
They'll just melt.

28:00.487 --> 28:01.821
What'd we miss?

28:01.854 --> 28:03.959
I'll do the explaining.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.206
What's he doing here?

28:23.239 --> 28:25.142
Said he was looking for you.

28:28.985 --> 28:31.485
I was wondering
if something was wrong.

28:32.949 --> 28:34.882
Why's that?

28:36.557 --> 28:39.222
Awfully quiet today.

28:39.255 --> 28:41.262
What's it to you?

28:43.966 --> 28:45.461
Hurt your leg?

28:48.504 --> 28:50.337
I'm gonna use it to club rats.

28:50.370 --> 28:53.303
Having trouble with those?

28:53.344 --> 28:55.676
They're all over the roof.

28:57.907 --> 29:01.510
If there is a problem, I just want
to make sure I don't get in the way,

29:01.550 --> 29:03.612
poke around where
I don't belong.

29:03.685 --> 29:06.251
It wouldn't be smart.

29:08.716 --> 29:11.421
Jesus.
You Prohees.

29:11.454 --> 29:13.125
Hand's always out.

29:13.158 --> 29:14.892
<i>That wasn't what I was asking.</i>

29:14.925 --> 29:16.260
Not even a week.

29:16.325 --> 29:17.859
<i>Nobody wants to get caught.</i>

29:17.892 --> 29:21.298
I'm involved in this, too.
That's all I'm saying.

29:21.331 --> 29:23.205
And it's a month.

29:23.238 --> 29:24.806
Not a month.

29:24.871 --> 29:26.910
It is.
I keep track.

29:43.054 --> 29:45.588
I thought I saw
something scurry.

29:50.731 --> 29:52.867
Thank you.

29:56.635 --> 29:59.601
Closed for inventory?

29:59.634 --> 30:01.937
Death in the family.

30:01.970 --> 30:03.740
Was it sudden?

30:03.773 --> 30:06.581
Just the last few feet.

30:13.018 --> 30:15.586
Well, if there's
anything I can do...

30:15.619 --> 30:17.692
It'll all be taken care of.

30:20.826 --> 30:22.791
Hold on a sec.

30:25.762 --> 30:27.794
<i>Give me your badge.</i>

30:31.299 --> 30:33.434
Come on.

30:46.019 --> 30:48.354
There is something you can do.

30:51.985 --> 30:54.056
Mr. Calhoun, my name
is Agent Warren Knox.

30:54.121 --> 30:55.626
I'm here on
government business.

30:55.659 --> 30:57.331
It's come to my attention
this bank is storing

30:57.364 --> 30:59.768
the personal effects of one
Edward Kessler, deceased.

30:59.801 --> 31:02.303
- Yes.
- Mr. Kessler was a Prussian national

31:02.336 --> 31:04.069
whom we have reason
to believe had ties

31:04.102 --> 31:05.803
to a group of local anarchists.

31:05.837 --> 31:07.802
- Anarchists?
- Remember the Palmer Raids?

31:07.843 --> 31:10.505
- I do. - The threat of foreign
agitation hasn't gone away.

31:10.540 --> 31:13.316
- You're saying this man--
- There are documents, Mr. Calhoun,

31:13.349 --> 31:16.116
secured in that box which may be
germane to our investigation.

31:16.149 --> 31:17.547
But without
some legal auth--

31:17.580 --> 31:20.018
Are you attempting to obstruct
a federal investigation

31:20.051 --> 31:21.954
into anti-American
activities?

31:21.987 --> 31:24.890
- Of course not.
- Whose side are you on?

31:27.524 --> 31:29.163
Right this way.

31:32.268 --> 31:34.968
Dad.

32:04.761 --> 32:07.527
<i>You lie on your
back and close your eyes</i>

32:07.562 --> 32:09.234
<i>and count to 100.</i>

32:09.267 --> 32:10.669
<i>Close to 100.</i>

32:10.709 --> 32:13.243
Then you can see in the dark.

32:13.309 --> 32:15.674
You go up, up, up like this.

32:15.707 --> 32:17.209
And there it is.

32:17.242 --> 32:20.838
<i>And even though it's shaped</i>
<i>like a ladle for soup,</i>

32:20.878 --> 32:23.309
it's actually called the Bear.

32:23.342 --> 32:24.907
Big Bear.

32:24.948 --> 32:27.883
Follow straight up
and there's the North Star.

32:27.916 --> 32:31.182
That means you can
never get lost.

32:31.223 --> 32:33.621
So if you're ever on a boat

32:33.654 --> 32:35.420
or in the desert...

32:35.453 --> 32:37.952
He was in "Wisconstin."

32:58.673 --> 33:00.777
<i>Look at that mouth.</i>

33:02.651 --> 33:04.548
Nasty sons of bitches.

33:04.589 --> 33:06.923
They are by the time
they get here.

33:06.956 --> 33:08.491
What do you mean?

33:08.524 --> 33:11.092
Well, they starve them,

33:11.125 --> 33:13.156
jack 'em up good with a hypo.

33:13.197 --> 33:14.892
A little taste of blood,

33:14.933 --> 33:16.563
just enough to get
the juices flowing.

33:16.596 --> 33:18.916
Throw 'em in there together and
get the hell out of the way.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.268
You like this, don't you?

33:26.405 --> 33:28.708
I'm just getting warmed up.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.917
<i>Nuck!</i>

33:39.157 --> 33:41.450
Here's the man
you want to know.

33:41.491 --> 33:43.121
Mr. Pierce.

33:43.154 --> 33:46.858
Mr. Thompson. Welcome to
the land of possibilities.

33:46.891 --> 33:49.361
Which do you like?

33:49.394 --> 33:51.761
50 bucks on the one
with the leg in his mouth.

33:52.963 --> 33:54.932
Those boys hunt some
of the meanest gators

33:54.973 --> 33:56.667
<i>the Glades have to offer.</i>

33:58.371 --> 33:59.705
Pretty mean themselves.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.440
You have to get to know them.

34:07.349 --> 34:10.786
<i>These are my partners, Messrs.
Lansky and Luciano.</i>

34:12.817 --> 34:14.848
And who is who?

34:14.888 --> 34:17.121
I'm Lansky, Meyer.

34:17.154 --> 34:19.164
This is Charlie Luciano.

34:19.197 --> 34:20.661
Ah, Sicilianu?

34:20.695 --> 34:22.734
New York.

34:22.766 --> 34:26.603
Ah. I'm thinking
of someone else.

34:26.637 --> 34:28.170
And you, Mr. Pierce?

34:28.204 --> 34:32.507
Well, you try getting those
men to pronounce Petrucelli.

34:32.540 --> 34:34.475
Besides, why do we come here?

34:34.507 --> 34:36.179
To start ourselves over, no?

34:36.213 --> 34:38.978
If you two gents want
to talk in private...

34:39.012 --> 34:40.978
I'll leave that to the guest.

34:41.012 --> 34:42.545
You know what
we're looking for.

34:42.585 --> 34:44.551
14,000 acres,

34:44.583 --> 34:47.552
the freedom to ship
our product as we please

34:47.585 --> 34:49.384
now and in the future.

34:49.425 --> 34:51.056
<i>What'd I tell you, Nuck?</i>

34:51.089 --> 34:53.223
August Tucker was loud.

34:53.288 --> 34:55.460
I prefer to be quiet.

34:55.494 --> 34:58.554
I have concerns
from Ybor City to Cuba.

34:58.594 --> 35:00.162
All over.

35:00.195 --> 35:03.229
As long as your concerns
don't become my concerns,

35:03.262 --> 35:05.198
Mr. Petrucelli.

35:05.239 --> 35:08.602
500,000 cash.

35:08.635 --> 35:10.865
If the terms are the same
as with Tucker,

35:10.906 --> 35:13.106
you now have twice the partner
you were hoping for.

35:13.139 --> 35:15.476
We'll need to give it
some thought.

35:27.889 --> 35:29.825
I stand by my reputation.

35:29.858 --> 35:31.489
Ask around.

35:31.522 --> 35:34.529
But for now,
let's do as the Romans.

35:35.426 --> 35:37.529
Please, please.

36:20.104 --> 36:22.505
<i>Miss Daughter Maitland.</i>

36:24.379 --> 36:26.452
What's the weather, Miss D?

36:28.346 --> 36:30.847
Coming down hard.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.952
No Sunday strolling?

36:38.230 --> 36:41.628
You woke up, wash your face...

36:41.668 --> 36:43.994
...put on your clothes,

36:44.035 --> 36:45.635
went about your business,

36:45.668 --> 36:49.678
shaking hands, passing smiles,

36:49.711 --> 36:51.743
counting coin.

36:52.647 --> 36:54.707
Got a secret.

36:54.740 --> 36:57.244
Can't tell nobody.

36:57.277 --> 36:59.853
Carry it close,

36:59.886 --> 37:02.821
dawn to dusk.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.291
Pick up tomorrow

37:05.324 --> 37:08.257
all over again.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.662
Life...

37:13.335 --> 37:15.469
ain't nothing at all.

37:18.067 --> 37:21.569

39:36.132 --> 39:38.268
Yeah?

39:49.076 --> 39:51.449
No one's been
looking after them.

39:53.547 --> 39:55.924
What do they know
what's going on?

40:00.358 --> 40:02.561
- That it?
- Yes, sir.

40:05.827 --> 40:07.331
Any problems?

40:07.364 --> 40:10.236
Not after I threatened to
charge him with obstruction.

40:12.102 --> 40:13.970
You got some hidden corners.

40:14.003 --> 40:16.200
I was sweating the whole time.

40:21.074 --> 40:23.945
- Hmm.
- What's wrong?

40:23.978 --> 40:26.314
It's all here
as far as I can tell.

40:26.347 --> 40:28.282
<i>You thought he stole it?</i>

40:30.419 --> 40:31.987
I figured...

40:32.020 --> 40:33.923
why else, right?

40:33.956 --> 40:35.722
Why else what?

40:36.794 --> 40:39.529
Why else kill yourself?

40:39.562 --> 40:42.001
Is that what he did?

40:54.472 --> 40:56.375
There are other accounts.

40:56.408 --> 40:58.080
All in his name.

40:58.113 --> 41:00.647
That's how Nucky wanted it.

41:00.680 --> 41:03.783
So we'll keep
doing this, all right?

41:03.816 --> 41:06.624
I really appreciate your trust.

41:06.657 --> 41:08.656
We're all just trying
to make a living.

41:13.728 --> 41:15.559
Hey.

41:22.137 --> 41:24.040
You speak any German?

41:25.337 --> 41:27.640
I took a year in high school.

41:38.015 --> 41:40.222
What's this say?

41:44.423 --> 41:46.991
Oh, boy.

41:47.032 --> 41:48.896
What?

41:51.465 --> 41:53.602
I...

41:53.635 --> 41:55.676
"My dearest son,

41:55.709 --> 41:58.981
this afternoon I got
the happy message

41:59.014 --> 42:01.947
that I am a grandfather.

42:01.980 --> 42:04.580
I cannot express
the joy."

42:07.655 --> 42:09.591
Go on.

42:09.657 --> 42:11.759
That's all there is.

42:20.366 --> 42:22.438
Which one you think?

42:25.271 --> 42:27.807
The taller one, I guess.

42:32.155 --> 42:33.923
You have kids?

42:33.956 --> 42:35.856
No, not yet.

42:37.791 --> 42:40.656
My oldest is off at college.

42:41.826 --> 42:44.394
Seven more behind him.

42:47.530 --> 42:49.830
You worry, you know?

42:51.871 --> 42:54.008
You're always worried.

42:57.376 --> 43:00.478
And the thought now
that I could--

43:00.511 --> 43:02.881
that I could just leave them...

43:43.656 --> 43:45.255
You're overreacting.

43:45.288 --> 43:47.622
Probably went straight on the
horn to Joe in New York.

43:47.655 --> 43:49.421
Why would he do that?

43:49.462 --> 43:51.325
They're cousins, Meyer.

43:51.398 --> 43:53.396
1,000 miles away
from each other.

43:54.829 --> 43:56.428
You don't understand.

43:56.468 --> 43:59.838
I understand Petrucelli is not gonna
walk away from an opportunity.

43:59.871 --> 44:02.541
- <i>We cut Masseria in.</i>
- It's too fucking late.

44:02.574 --> 44:04.237
I already went behind his back.

44:04.278 --> 44:05.708
What does he care?
He'll go for the money.

44:05.741 --> 44:07.540
Oh, you're the expert on Joe?

44:07.573 --> 44:09.042
I saw him take
a Gladstone full of cash

44:09.075 --> 44:10.610
from Nucky Thompson
a couple of months ago.

44:10.643 --> 44:12.946
And all the way back to the
city he's talking about the day

44:12.979 --> 44:15.050
he's gonna blow the top
of Nucky's head off.

44:15.083 --> 44:16.818
He never forgets.

44:16.851 --> 44:19.082
He'll wait forever.
That's how he is.

44:19.122 --> 44:20.888
Then let him
chase you down here.

44:21.952 --> 44:24.223
I'm not living
in fucking Florida.

44:24.256 --> 44:27.023
This pans out,
we live wherever we want.

44:27.056 --> 44:29.328
I already live
where I want--

44:29.393 --> 44:32.860
<i>in a hotel suite in Manhattan.</i>

44:35.093 --> 44:37.100
Yeah.

44:37.133 --> 44:39.068
I'll just take care of it, huh?

44:39.101 --> 44:41.301
What does that mean?

44:41.334 --> 44:44.435
Petrucelli.
And it ends there.

44:44.468 --> 44:46.041
How simple is that?

44:46.074 --> 44:48.073
We're in business with him.

44:48.106 --> 44:49.843
<i>So we find someone else.</i>

44:49.876 --> 44:53.149
- This is now. This is happening now.
- You're not listening.

44:53.182 --> 44:54.982
This is bad for me.

44:55.015 --> 44:57.453
<i>We back out of the deal.</i>

44:57.486 --> 44:59.083
All right, that's it.

44:59.124 --> 45:01.091
We'll get something else
going closer to home.

45:01.124 --> 45:03.792
- <i>Leave it to me.</i>
- I said that's it.

45:09.829 --> 45:11.364
What are you talking about?

45:11.397 --> 45:13.869
You do what you want,
but I'm in.

45:13.902 --> 45:15.772
I'm staying.

45:19.309 --> 45:21.781
We're partners, Meyer.

45:24.319 --> 45:26.646
Not on this.
Not anymore.

45:27.687 --> 45:29.254
You don't got the green.

45:29.287 --> 45:32.084
You don't know what I have.

45:32.125 --> 45:34.523
You sly little sheeny.

45:34.556 --> 45:37.460
That's right, Charlie. Let's
hear what you really think.

45:39.727 --> 45:41.630
Dig your own fucking grave.

45:41.663 --> 45:43.903
- You don't touch Petrucelli.
- <i>Fuck you.</i>

46:04.490 --> 46:06.193
You squeeze this
out of an alligator?

46:06.226 --> 46:09.190
I'm not saying no.

46:09.231 --> 46:12.198
I'm tight enough already.

46:12.231 --> 46:14.632
Thought you were a gentleman.

46:14.665 --> 46:16.032
All at once.

46:16.073 --> 46:18.504
Does it hurt less that way?

46:18.537 --> 46:20.977
Not really.

46:25.681 --> 46:28.182
Oh, Jesus Christ.

46:30.414 --> 46:31.917
What is this?

46:31.950 --> 46:33.287
Potcheen.

46:33.320 --> 46:36.192
This isn't potcheen.
This is battery acid.

46:36.225 --> 46:38.391
Well, you're awful finicky.

46:38.424 --> 46:40.662
- No.
- Yes.

46:40.695 --> 46:42.630
All right.

46:54.506 --> 46:56.378
So...

46:57.284 --> 46:59.220
Hmm?

47:00.886 --> 47:03.220
What do you know

47:03.253 --> 47:05.721
about Vincenzo Petrucelli?

47:09.563 --> 47:12.364
You are one hell
of a sweet-talker.

47:12.397 --> 47:15.501
<i>Don't say you don't know him.</i>

47:15.534 --> 47:18.466
You already made up
your mind, didn't you?

47:20.171 --> 47:22.236
<i>Well, have you?</i>

47:22.277 --> 47:24.510
I don't know.

47:24.543 --> 47:27.384
I'm not feeling very certain
of things lately.

47:27.449 --> 47:28.953
Oh, yeah?

47:35.795 --> 47:38.830
I'm trying to build
something here.

47:38.871 --> 47:40.932
I don't know why.

47:43.300 --> 47:46.002
<i>And I wonder if I did nothing,</i>

47:46.035 --> 47:49.711
<i>nothing at all,</i>
<i>if I wouldn't be happier.</i>

47:49.744 --> 47:51.952
But I can't stop.

47:51.985 --> 47:54.247
I tried.

47:54.288 --> 47:57.551
But I just-- I--

47:57.584 --> 48:00.162
I get wound up.

48:00.195 --> 48:03.668
<i>14,000 acres.</i>
<i>What am I doing?</i>

48:08.301 --> 48:10.871
I lost someone.

48:10.912 --> 48:13.146
A friend.

48:13.179 --> 48:15.850
He lived for me.

48:15.883 --> 48:18.520
<i>And all I think is,</i>

48:18.553 --> 48:21.555
<i>what don't I know about him?</i>

48:21.588 --> 48:24.831
What he was up to?

48:24.864 --> 48:27.301
Do I need to be worried?

48:30.597 --> 48:33.641
What kind of person
does that make me?

48:33.674 --> 48:37.345
<i>That I would want this</i>
<i>to be my life?</i>

48:37.378 --> 48:40.047
First time I came down here,

48:40.080 --> 48:42.182
it was for money.

48:42.215 --> 48:44.184
Just money.

48:44.217 --> 48:46.859
<i>But there was something.</i>

48:46.892 --> 48:50.960
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>something in the air.</i>

48:50.993 --> 48:52.892
And I thought--

48:54.220 --> 48:56.525
- I felt--
- <i>Hey.</i>

48:56.558 --> 48:58.735
What?

49:05.469 --> 49:07.036
What the hell was that?

49:08.070 --> 49:09.478
Get up.

49:09.511 --> 49:10.744
Are you out of your mind?

49:10.777 --> 49:12.281
It's all right.
Come on.

49:12.314 --> 49:14.049
- You can't just--
- Yeah.

49:14.082 --> 49:16.151
I don't know
what that was about.

49:16.184 --> 49:18.318
Come on now, really.

49:20.591 --> 49:22.258
Lay off that turpentine.

49:22.291 --> 49:25.630
I might
be a little pasted.

49:25.663 --> 49:27.468
I'll say.

49:27.501 --> 49:29.099
You know what, though?

49:30.838 --> 49:33.744
I just hate a goddamn whiner.

49:37.020 --> 49:38.715
I'm not gonna hit a woman.

49:38.748 --> 49:42.647
Then I'm gonna knock
your ass into a hat.

49:46.324 --> 49:48.060
I'm sorry,
but I told you--

49:48.093 --> 49:50.961
- Why you--
- Hey! Stop it!

49:51.961 --> 49:53.599
Stop.

50:09.344 --> 50:11.144
Well?

50:12.880 --> 50:14.983
Well, what?

50:28.365 --> 50:31.564
Let's go, Sparky. I'll give
you something to cry about.

50:55.444 --> 50:58.779
When did he get so
interested in the stars?

50:58.820 --> 51:00.820
I don't remember exactly.

51:00.853 --> 51:02.828
Couple of months.

51:02.857 --> 51:04.730
He's gotten very concerned

51:04.763 --> 51:08.467
about navigating his way
back from places.

51:08.532 --> 51:11.434
Not so easy, is it?

51:16.342 --> 51:18.878
You've seen Gillian?

51:18.919 --> 51:21.044
In court.

51:21.085 --> 51:23.747
She came to his school
a few days ago.

51:23.780 --> 51:27.820
That was... peculiar.

51:29.759 --> 51:31.125
How's she living?

51:31.158 --> 51:34.091
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

51:34.124 --> 51:36.960
She's selling that house.

51:37.025 --> 51:39.395
Trying to.

51:45.679 --> 51:47.710
<i>There's a hearing next month.</i>

51:47.743 --> 51:50.078
And then the judge decides.

51:50.111 --> 51:52.816
It's difficult because--

51:54.416 --> 51:57.188
because we can't really
talk about what happened.

51:57.221 --> 51:59.419
Why not?

51:59.484 --> 52:01.355
To protect you.

52:02.525 --> 52:05.692
You don't need
to worry about that.

52:05.725 --> 52:08.658
You killed those men.

52:12.235 --> 52:14.570
And you ran away.

52:17.738 --> 52:20.735
Would you have wanted
me to stay?

52:22.240 --> 52:23.840
I didn't say I did.

52:27.945 --> 52:30.016
What happened to your hand?

52:32.552 --> 52:34.615
Something I deserved.

52:35.954 --> 52:38.193
Richard.

52:38.226 --> 52:40.592
You bring him to us.

52:40.625 --> 52:42.255
You vanish.

52:42.328 --> 52:44.631
<i>We can't let him go back.</i>

52:44.664 --> 52:47.631
You turned my life upside down.

52:50.203 --> 52:52.570
I'll give you money for him.

52:52.603 --> 52:55.177
I'm not talking about money.

52:57.673 --> 52:59.440
Then what?

52:59.481 --> 53:03.218
I don't want to do
all this by myself.

53:03.251 --> 53:05.849
But how can I trust you?

53:10.387 --> 53:13.122
Hey, Hercules
is right over our house.

53:15.363 --> 53:17.761
Then let's follow him home.

53:24.337 --> 53:26.441
Are you coming?

53:29.577 --> 53:31.608
He's coming.

53:58.201 --> 54:00.074
Hell happened to you?

54:00.107 --> 54:03.178
- Rogue possum.
- <i>What?</i>

54:03.211 --> 54:06.175
Keep an eye out.
They can pounce at any time.

54:07.544 --> 54:10.112
- Where's your friend?
- Mr. Thompson, I have--

54:10.153 --> 54:13.490
Seeing as we're partners, how
about we start using first names?

54:13.523 --> 54:15.226
Meyer.

54:20.795 --> 54:23.035
Charlie's out.

54:23.997 --> 54:25.165
Why?

54:25.206 --> 54:28.172
When it came down to it,
he couldn't see the angle.

54:28.205 --> 54:29.835
<i>The money?</i>

54:29.876 --> 54:32.340
I'm covering it...

54:32.373 --> 54:34.013
Nucky.

54:36.520 --> 54:39.420
Then it's me, Meyer,
and Petrucelli.

54:39.460 --> 54:41.555
Finder's fee to Bill.

54:48.032 --> 54:51.268
Miss Wheet has my instructions
to complete the transaction.

54:52.302 --> 54:54.205
<i>Regarding the new business,</i>

54:54.238 --> 54:56.677
she'll watch over
my part of it down here.

55:00.351 --> 55:01.949
Sure, Nuck.

55:01.982 --> 55:03.684
Good call.

55:03.716 --> 55:05.780
Delighted to have you on board.

55:08.158 --> 55:10.852
A snort for the road.

55:19.829 --> 55:22.605
- My condolences.
- For what?

55:22.638 --> 55:24.900
For your man Eddie.

55:27.603 --> 55:30.107
That all happened
somewhere else.

55:38.578 --> 55:41.384
It open.

55:49.119 --> 55:50.758
You wanted to see me?

55:50.791 --> 55:52.623
Wanted you last night.

55:52.656 --> 55:55.634
I didn't get the message.

55:55.667 --> 55:58.802
You run out the back
like you robbing a pawnshop.

56:00.906 --> 56:03.042
Is something missing?

56:17.893 --> 56:19.990
You think you Ma Rainey.

56:20.030 --> 56:21.429
What?

56:21.462 --> 56:23.165
<i>I want her.</i>

56:23.198 --> 56:25.300
I hire her.

56:25.365 --> 56:27.837
But you,

56:27.870 --> 56:30.700
you come on after the tap boys
and before the fan number.

56:30.741 --> 56:33.436
- <i>That's all you do.</i>
- I wasn't in the mood.

56:33.477 --> 56:35.879
I don't care what mood you in.

56:37.345 --> 56:40.249
Standing there telling folk
life ain't worth living.

56:40.282 --> 56:41.521
It made them listen, didn't it?

56:41.554 --> 56:43.657
I don't care if they listening.

56:43.690 --> 56:46.058
I care they drinking
and spending money.

56:46.091 --> 56:47.765
They didn't come out
for no funeral.

56:47.798 --> 56:50.869
<i>10 of 'em up and left 'cause
you wasn't in the mood.</i>

56:53.167 --> 56:55.374
- Where you going?
- To my room.

56:55.407 --> 56:56.870
Then back to New York.

56:56.911 --> 57:00.110
- You under contract here.
- You don't like what I do.

57:00.143 --> 57:02.711
Then you gonna do what I like.

57:02.744 --> 57:04.679
Dr. Narcisse has
other singers.

57:04.720 --> 57:07.885
Drag you in here
like he doing me a favor.

57:08.821 --> 57:11.651
Libyan brotherhood.

57:11.684 --> 57:15.190
He ain't nothing but a
nigger with a dictionary.

57:15.223 --> 57:16.758
Take that up with him.

57:16.791 --> 57:19.628
You think I won't?

57:19.661 --> 57:22.362
I think I'd like to leave.

57:22.395 --> 57:24.131
Please.

57:25.901 --> 57:29.666
You too fine for this.

57:29.699 --> 57:32.073
You don't know
anything about me.

57:33.473 --> 57:36.675
I know ain't no princess
come out of no barrel house.

57:38.516 --> 57:40.747
I saw you watching me.

57:42.316 --> 57:44.219
Last night.

57:45.317 --> 57:47.587
I saw you.

57:47.620 --> 57:50.427
And I know what you are.
