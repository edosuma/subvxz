- Jesus.

01:34.370 --> 01:35.371
- Yeah.

01:36.539 --> 01:38.208
Swamp will eat a body up.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.459
When we found her,

01:40.460 --> 01:42.669
we advised dispatch

01:42.670 --> 01:45.255
and we took a few
pictures before we left.

01:45.256 --> 01:46.381
- Good.

01:46.382 --> 01:48.676
I gotta get closer.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.436
Oh, shit.

females gone missing

02:05.777 --> 02:08.612

All right, I'm done.

02:23.503 --> 02:24.545
- Detective.

02:24.546 --> 02:26.088
Detective?

02:26.089 --> 02:27.714
Detective, is there
any information

02:27.715 --> 02:29.383
you could share with
us at this time?

02:29.384 --> 02:30.842
- No.

02:30.843 --> 02:32.803
All right, you
guys can go ahead.

02:32.804 --> 02:33.929
- Detective, isn't this the
second body in the bayou

02:33.930 --> 02:35.472
in the last two months?

02:35.473 --> 02:37.057
Do you have any
leads at this time?

02:37.058 --> 02:39.142

has been found

03:05.587 --> 03:07.588

- Should
our citizens be concerned

03:19.559 --> 03:21.310
at this time?

03:21.311 --> 03:22.561
Do we need a neighborhood
watch, a curfew,

03:22.562 --> 03:24.062
or should the FBI be involved?

03:24.063 --> 03:26.898

04:25.958 --> 04:28.752
an important question for you.

04:28.753 --> 04:30.754
Oh, I'm so happy.

04:30.755 --> 04:32.964

04:55.947 --> 04:58.782
You don't want to see this.

04:58.783 --> 04:59.950

07:29.100 --> 07:30.768
Good to see you.

07:32.228 --> 07:33.478
- Pop?

07:33.479 --> 07:35.772
- What's up with you?

07:35.773 --> 07:37.274
Haven't seen you for weeks

07:37.275 --> 07:39.067
and you show up
looking like this?

07:39.068 --> 07:40.735
- Thanks, Pop.

07:46.117 --> 07:47.200
- All right, you GUYS-

07:47.201 --> 07:48.326
That's enough of that.

help him clean up?

07:58.170 --> 08:00.171
- All right, Dad.

08:00.172 --> 08:01.673

08:01.674 --> 08:03.843
- Yeah, son, good
to see you too.

08:47.136 --> 08:51.182
- Mom, I need five
dollars for tomorrow.

08:54.226 --> 08:55.686
- Five dollars.

09:02.193 --> 09:03.401
- Mom?

09:03.402 --> 09:06.279
Did God invent money?

09:06.280 --> 09:08.199
- No, sweetie.

09:12.244 --> 09:14.871
- So why does it say,
"In God we trust"

09:14.872 --> 09:16.665
on the dollar bill?

09:16.666 --> 09:20.002
- Sweetie, God has
nothing to do with money.

09:43.067 --> 09:44.068
- Here.

09:48.364 --> 09:49.531
Check it out.

09:49.532 --> 09:50.574

09:52.410 --> 09:53.952
- Keep it.

09:53.953 --> 09:55.745
For a good luck charm.

09:55.746 --> 09:58.790
- What do I need a
good luck charm for?

09:58.791 --> 10:00.543
- To protect you.

10:02.962 --> 10:04.546
- All right.

10:04.547 --> 10:05.672
Gotta go.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.132
Bad guys to catch, man.

10:07.133 --> 10:08.425
See you around, man?

10:08.426 --> 10:09.385
- Mhmm.

10:09.386 --> 10:10.386
Bye.

10:10.387 --> 10:11.970
. HEY-

10:11.971 --> 10:13.388
Make sure you call
dad later, okay?

10:13.389 --> 10:20.437
He needs to hear from you often.

10:20.438 --> 10:21.730
I'll walk you out.

10:21.731 --> 10:23.315
Stay put, Luce.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.199
Hey, wait.

10:43.044 --> 10:44.169
Are you okay?

10:44.170 --> 10:45.171
- What?

10:46.589 --> 10:49.007
- You don't look so good.

10:49.008 --> 10:50.051
- Thanks.

10:51.469 --> 10:53.470
I got stress at work.

10:53.471 --> 10:54.472
I'm fine.

10:56.974 --> 10:59.101
- Any news on the case?

11:02.188 --> 11:03.647
I know it's hard.

11:06.984 --> 11:08.569
I miss 'em too.

11:25.586 --> 11:27.670
- I gotta go to work, all right?

11:27.671 --> 11:29.089
. Okay-

11:29.090 --> 11:30.925
- Thanks for dinner.

11:33.052 --> 11:36.554
- At least change your
clothes sometimes.

11:36.555 --> 11:38.557
- I love you too, sis.

11:42.561 --> 11:46.357
Headquarters to 601.

11:48.567 --> 11:50.569
Headquarters to 601.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.447
- This is 601. Go ahead.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.616
- 601, be en
route to 1618 Market Street,

11:56.617 --> 11:58.118
Coyote's Bar and Grill,

11:58.119 --> 12:00.787
in reference to
an investigation.

12:02.665 --> 12:04.666
Contact your callers,

12:04.667 --> 12:06.668
a white female and a black
female in front of the bar.

12:06.669 --> 12:08.294
Callers state that they are
going to have information

12:08.295 --> 12:11.507
regarding the homicide
of Debbie Teague.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.680
- You better be here
looking for Debbie.

12:18.681 --> 12:20.306
- You don't look a kind of cop

12:20.307 --> 12:23.394
to give us working
girls a hard time.

12:24.603 --> 12:25.813
- Fair enough.

12:27.356 --> 12:29.357
Let me make it up to you.

12:29.358 --> 12:31.109
You girls work on
commission, right?

12:31.110 --> 12:32.944
- That's right.

12:32.945 --> 12:35.280
- I'll get us some
drinks, anything you want.

12:35.281 --> 12:36.656
I'd like a whisky.

12:36.657 --> 12:37.658
- Thank you.

12:39.034 --> 12:40.202
- Sit down?

12:44.456 --> 12:46.666
What can you tell me
about Ms. Hassell?

12:46.667 --> 12:47.710
- Debbie?

12:48.836 --> 12:51.045
She was a good girl.

12:51.046 --> 12:52.881
- Why you say "was?"

12:52.882 --> 12:55.300
- You hear about all
these girls going missing,

12:55.301 --> 12:59.012
but don't ever hear about
anybody finding them.

12:59.013 --> 13:02.682
- Yeah, we're working on that.

13:02.683 --> 13:05.518
- We know how dangerous
it is out there.

13:05.519 --> 13:08.479
Even without the serial killers.

13:08.480 --> 13:12.358
We always tell each
other where we're going.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.278
- All right, so when the
last time you saw her?

13:15.279 --> 13:17.363
- Last night,

13:17.364 --> 13:19.240
around 11.

13:19.241 --> 13:21.576
She left with some guy.

13:21.577 --> 13:23.494
- Did you get a look at him?

13:23.495 --> 13:25.247
- No, not really.

13:29.460 --> 13:33.463
- And you wonder why we have
trouble catching the guy.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.173
You know if she has
any regular hang outs,

13:35.174 --> 13:38.218
friends she might be with?

13:38.219 --> 13:41.262
- I said we looked
out for one another.

13:41.263 --> 13:45.100
Didn't say nothing about
being best friends.

13:50.731 --> 13:54.109
- So what kind of
cop do I look like?

13:56.487 --> 13:59.114
- You don't look like a cop.

14:00.866 --> 14:02.785
You look like trouble.

14:05.537 --> 14:07.748
That's all right though.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.045
I like bad boys.

14:59.842 --> 15:00.843
. Woo!

15:24.616 --> 15:26.659
- You look a little
drowsy, honey.

15:26.660 --> 15:30.371
I say you and me step outside
for a breath of fresh air.

15:30.372 --> 15:32.207
- It'll cost you 50.

15:54.813 --> 15:56.397
- Me and my buddy, here,

15:56.398 --> 16:00.026
we like to shoot
at the same hole.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.612
- Got that right.

16:11.914 --> 16:14.165
- Oh, show me how
you like it, big boy.

16:16.085 --> 16:17.086
Deeper!

16:29.139 --> 16:32.141
- I'll take care of
both y'all real fine.

16:32.142 --> 16:33.643
But it'll cost your double

16:33.644 --> 16:35.561
for double the trouble.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.356
- It ain't gonna be no trouble.

16:38.357 --> 16:39.608
Just double.

16:40.901 --> 16:43.653
- Fuck me, cowboy, come on!

16:43.654 --> 16:45.905
Come on, cowboy.

16:45.906 --> 16:49.200
- There's
gonna be three of us now.

16:50.786 --> 16:51.869
I'm gonna be...

16:53.789 --> 16:56.666
Oh my god, how long?

17:02.256 --> 17:04.674
Oh, I'm so happy-

17:04.675 --> 17:06.342
I'm glad you're happy.

17:06.343 --> 17:08.719
Oh, I'm so happy.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.681
I love you, Harry.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.641
I love you girls too.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.647
- What the fuck?

17:20.648 --> 17:22.775
Are you serious?

17:22.776 --> 17:24.944
I was just about to come.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.989
Oh, you fucking loser.

17:29.283 --> 17:30.951
God, fuck, damn it.

17:39.668 --> 17:41.586
- Where's the cop?

17:41.587 --> 17:43.087
- Mean the loser?

17:43.088 --> 17:44.714
He's still in the bathroom.

17:44.715 --> 17:46.382
- Damn.

17:46.383 --> 17:49.595
- You up for
some fun tonight, babe?

17:51.180 --> 17:52.430
- Sorry, boys.

17:52.431 --> 17:54.349
The sign says closed.

17:55.517 --> 17:57.685
- What we waiting for?

17:57.686 --> 17:58.937
Let's roll.

18:12.201 --> 18:14.285
- So this is your love nest?

18:14.286 --> 18:15.579
- That's right.

18:17.706 --> 18:19.499
Just had the carpet redone.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.125
- Did you?

18:21.126 --> 18:22.460
- Now the curtains
match the carpet.

18:22.461 --> 18:24.213
- I'm so impressed.

18:25.964 --> 18:28.550
Now it gonna be 50 dollars.

18:29.468 --> 18:31.219
Easy!

18:31.220 --> 18:32.345
- Don't make a sound!
- Don't make a sound!

18:32.346 --> 18:33.471
Don't you say a word.

18:33.472 --> 18:34.597
Don't make a sound.

18:34.598 --> 18:36.307
Do you understand?

18:36.308 --> 18:37.308
Now you get on your
knees bitch, right now.

18:37.309 --> 18:38.309
Get up.

18:38.310 --> 18:39.310
Get down there.

18:39.311 --> 18:40.394
Down.

18:40.395 --> 18:41.646
- Suck it, bitch.

18:41.647 --> 18:43.148
- Get down on your knees.

18:44.441 --> 18:45.483
- Come here.

18:46.485 --> 18:47.693
Suck it.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.861
- Think she likes it.

18:48.862 --> 18:49.862
- Suck it.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.864
Use a rubber.

18:51.865 --> 18:54.450
I don't want you getting my
gun no herpes, you whore.

18:54.451 --> 18:56.786
Suck it. You like
that, don't you?

18:56.787 --> 18:59.497
You like a shaft
that big, right?

19:02.501 --> 19:04.919
- Give me the purse.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.796
- Come on, bitch.

19:09.508 --> 19:11.759
Put a rubber on it.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.886
- This all you got, bitch?

19:13.887 --> 19:15.638
That's it?

19:15.639 --> 19:17.473
That's all you got?

19:19.476 --> 19:20.768
- Put it on.

19:20.769 --> 19:22.020
Put it on.

19:23.772 --> 19:25.523
Put it in your mouth.

19:25.524 --> 19:26.649
Come on. All of it.

19:26.650 --> 19:27.775
Suck all of it.

19:27.776 --> 19:28.776
All of it.

19:28.777 --> 19:30.152
Oh yeah.

19:30.153 --> 19:31.445
All of it. All of it.

19:31.446 --> 19:32.572
All of it.

19:32.573 --> 19:33.573
- All the way.

19:33.574 --> 19:34.574
- All of it.

19:34.575 --> 19:36.284
No teeth.

19:36.285 --> 19:37.660
Look at that. You
like that, don't you?

19:37.661 --> 19:38.995
You like that?

19:38.996 --> 19:40.079
- Go ahead, give it to her.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.080
She likes it, man.

19:41.081 --> 19:42.081
- Suck it.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.091
Suck it.

19:53.594 --> 19:55.094
Darker the berry

19:55.095 --> 19:56.679
the sweeter the
juice, right Dan?

19:56.680 --> 19:57.680
- That's right.

19:59.141 --> 20:01.058
- You get the fuck
away from her!

20:01.059 --> 20:03.019
- Ow, bitch!

20:03.020 --> 20:05.564
- You sick bastard!

20:07.190 --> 20:09.775
- Get the fuck away from her!

20:09.776 --> 20:12.236
- No trouble.

20:12.237 --> 20:15.489
What? You gonna shoot me
for getting a blow job, ho?

20:15.490 --> 20:19.660
Man, so you get off
in the bathroom?

20:19.661 --> 20:21.829
I'll get you off.

20:21.830 --> 20:22.872
- I will shoot you.

20:22.873 --> 20:23.999
- Yeah?

20:25.292 --> 20:27.668
Want me to suck you off?

20:27.669 --> 20:28.961
You want me to suck you off?

20:28.962 --> 20:30.254
- I will fucking shoot you.

20:30.255 --> 20:31.964
- I been waiting to do that.

20:44.895 --> 20:47.648
- Fucking go home and shower.

20:52.653 --> 20:54.612
- Hey, what if
she goes to the cops?

20:54.613 --> 20:56.864
- Hooker ain't going to no cops.

20:56.865 --> 20:58.532
- Yeah, but what if, man?

20:58.533 --> 21:00.451
- Will you shut up?

21:00.452 --> 21:04.456
- All right then,
here's to the whores.

21:12.756 --> 21:14.298
- How much you get?

21:14.299 --> 21:16.050
- Bitch only had
40 dollars, man.

21:16.051 --> 21:17.594
- Cheap ass ho.

21:19.554 --> 21:21.097
- Man, you gotta
turn right up here.

21:21.098 --> 21:22.890
- Give me the money.

21:30.941 --> 21:32.274
That's it?

21:32.275 --> 21:33.859
- That's it.

21:33.860 --> 21:34.945
- Get out.

22:48.435 --> 22:50.978
- I think I hear somebody coming

22:50.979 --> 22:52.813
down the drive way now.

22:52.814 --> 22:53.981
- Is it mom?

22:53.982 --> 22:55.024
- I don't know.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.568
- I'll go check.

23:01.198 --> 23:02.823
It's her.

23:02.824 --> 23:03.825
- Oh, Jesus.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.291
. Hey, baby.

23:12.375 --> 23:14.169
Goodness, look at you.

23:15.170 --> 23:17.213
Oh my goodness.

23:17.214 --> 23:19.006
God, Dan.

23:19.007 --> 23:21.050
Just look at this mess.

23:21.051 --> 23:23.177
You gotta be kidding me.

23:23.178 --> 23:25.471
- I had to work late last night.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.181
. Oh yeah?

23:27.182 --> 23:29.016
Do you even plan on
paying child support

23:29.017 --> 23:30.893
one of these days?

23:30.894 --> 23:34.146
Do you even know what shared
custody means, asshole?

23:34.147 --> 23:36.023
- What time is it?

23:36.024 --> 23:38.234
I haven't got paid yet.

23:38.235 --> 23:39.485
- Bullshit.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.028
I've got the court order.

23:41.029 --> 23:43.030
Your ass is going to jail, Dan.

23:43.031 --> 23:45.032
I can't stand your shit.

23:45.033 --> 23:47.034
- We don't have to do this
in front of the kid, Janet.

23:47.035 --> 23:49.078
- Don't touch me.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.246
Come here, baby.

23:50.247 --> 23:51.372
Listen, okay?

23:51.373 --> 23:53.082
I want you to go change

23:53.083 --> 23:56.085
and we can get ready
for our day, all right?

23:56.086 --> 23:58.087
Okay?

23:58.088 --> 23:59.755
I can't believe your ass.

23:59.756 --> 24:02.968
Oh my god, I can't
even believe this shit.

24:05.637 --> 24:08.055
- Here that's it.
- Don't take it all.

24:09.891 --> 24:10.892
- Oh my god.

24:12.060 --> 24:13.060
This is it?

24:13.061 --> 24:14.520
- That's it.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.188
- This is it? This is all I get?

24:16.189 --> 24:18.065
This is all you give
for you daughter?

24:18.066 --> 24:19.191
- That's it.

24:19.192 --> 24:20.944
- Here you go, keep it.

24:25.073 --> 24:26.074
Hey, baby.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.201
- Here you go.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.829
- Thank you, baby.

24:33.164 --> 24:34.707
- Have a nice day, daddy.

24:34.708 --> 24:37.167
- You too baby,
I'll see you later.

24:37.168 --> 24:38.627
- I'll bring her
by in the morning.

24:38.628 --> 24:40.797
That's if you're awake.

24:43.383 --> 24:44.426
Asshole!

27:24.502 --> 27:25.961
- I need some.

27:25.962 --> 27:27.337
- I got you, man.

27:27.338 --> 27:28.380
40aG.

27:28.381 --> 27:29.506
- Give it to me!

27:29.507 --> 27:30.507
- How much you want?

27:30.508 --> 27:31.592
- All of it!

27:31.593 --> 27:32.968
- Fuck this shit.

27:32.969 --> 27:34.511
Fuck off!

27:45.482 --> 27:46.983
Go fuck him up.

27:55.283 --> 27:56.284
Fuck yeah!

28:46.376 --> 28:49.337
- Thanks for the medicine, doc.

28:50.463 --> 28:52.632
- What is that? My tip?

28:54.050 --> 28:55.635
<i>_ I</i> got your tip.

28:56.928 --> 28:57.928
I got you a tip-

28:57.929 --> 28:58.929
- Yeah?

28:58.930 --> 28:59.973
- Mhmm.

29:01.641 --> 29:03.350
- You sure you don't
wanna stay tonight?

29:03.351 --> 29:05.060
- Yeah, what you got for me?

29:05.061 --> 29:06.603
- I'll make it worth
your while, baby.

29:06.604 --> 29:07.604
- Really?

29:07.605 --> 29:08.605
- Yeah.

29:33.882 --> 29:36.258
- Keep it wet for me.

29:36.259 --> 29:37.843
I'll be back later.

31:59.402 --> 32:00.445
- Charlie?

32:40.777 --> 32:41.778
Hello.

32:44.280 --> 32:45.531
Who is this?

32:48.117 --> 32:51.871
Make it short, I'm
really not in the mood.

32:53.748 --> 32:55.541
- Is Maria there?

32:58.628 --> 33:01.171
- Yeah, what do
you want her for?

33:07.470 --> 33:08.513
Hello?

33:13.559 --> 33:17.479
- A friend said I
could call you in case.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.107
- In case of what?

33:20.608 --> 33:22.819
- Just in case.

33:26.614 --> 33:27.739
- I'm really tired.

33:27.740 --> 33:30.200
I'm not in the mood.

33:30.201 --> 33:34.580
- Anyway, I needed a
little help with something.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.293
- What friend?

33:43.172 --> 33:47.427
- I think it's best if I
pay you a little visit.

33:49.262 --> 33:51.263
- Fucking asshole.

34:03.234 --> 34:05.570
What the fuck is going on?

34:08.656 --> 34:09.866
Shit.

34:29.802 --> 34:32.846
What the fuck is going on?

36:10.444 --> 36:11.988
- Be right there.

36:18.828 --> 36:20.203
- Hey, Mr. Cain.

36:20.204 --> 36:22.872
I got some cans for you.

36:22.873 --> 36:24.667
- Good work, kid.

36:25.585 --> 36:26.961
Be right back.

36:48.274 --> 36:51.027
Say hi to your family for me.

36:51.944 --> 36:53.070
- Thanks.

36:54.655 --> 36:55.822

37:01.037 --> 37:02.747

Hey, mom.

37:11.756 --> 37:13.673

- Really good.

37:16.677 --> 37:17.844
Hey.

37:17.845 --> 37:19.137
- How'd it go?

37:19.138 --> 37:20.639
- I made 25 bucks in 20 minutes.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.390
- Wow.

37:22.391 --> 37:23.433
- I am proud
of you. That is great.

37:23.434 --> 37:24.517
- That is amazing.

37:24.518 --> 37:25.518
- Hey, Jeremy.

37:25.519 --> 37:26.519
- How are you?

37:26.520 --> 37:27.812
- Good.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.397
God, you're getting so tall.

37:29.398 --> 37:31.942
- You're getting
shorter, I think.

37:33.069 --> 37:34.653
Hi, how's it going?

37:34.654 --> 37:35.820
- It's fine.

37:35.821 --> 37:36.863
So good to see you.

37:36.864 --> 37:37.948
- Me too.

37:39.033 --> 37:40.742
- That's my seat.

37:40.743 --> 37:42.535
- Okay, I guess I'll
just go to my room.

37:42.536 --> 37:44.287
- You work
hard, you need your rest.

37:44.288 --> 37:45.747
He's such a sweetheart.

37:45.748 --> 37:46.748
- Yes.

37:46.749 --> 37:47.832
- Goodness.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.627
- Hey, someone's here.

38:01.972 --> 38:03.807
- What the hell is this?

38:03.808 --> 38:05.350
Ain't serious, are you?

38:05.351 --> 38:07.018
- I didn't have
a choice, Thomas.

38:07.019 --> 38:08.311
- So you're dragging
me in front of a judge

38:08.312 --> 38:10.231
like some fucking criminal?

38:12.024 --> 38:13.733
- You owe me money.

38:13.734 --> 38:15.443
- What do you want me to do?

38:15.444 --> 38:16.778
I'm trying to get
myself together here.

38:16.779 --> 38:18.530
- I don't believe you anymore.

38:18.531 --> 38:19.781
All you been doing
is lying to me

38:19.782 --> 38:21.074
for the last couple of months.

38:21.075 --> 38:22.158
Spending all our money on poker.

38:22.159 --> 38:23.661
- Where you going?

38:27.623 --> 38:29.416
Like I'm done with you, bitch?

38:29.417 --> 38:31.918
What you think you gonna
get away with this?

38:31.919 --> 38:34.921
- Hey, Harry, are
you free right now?

38:34.922 --> 38:36.715
Yeah, I'm over at Sam's house

38:36.716 --> 38:38.842
and Thomas just got here
and he's raging angry.

38:38.843 --> 38:41.178
Can you please come over?

38:43.055 --> 38:44.181
- Loser.

38:46.892 --> 38:48.268
- Hey!

38:48.269 --> 38:49.811
Get out of here.

38:49.812 --> 38:51.146
I just called the cops.

38:52.189 --> 38:54.190
- Good for you.

38:54.191 --> 38:57.819
You ain't seeing a fucking
dime from me, how bout that?

38:57.820 --> 39:01.574
Why don't you go
back to sucking dick?

39:03.951 --> 39:05.161
- Fuck you.

39:34.523 --> 39:37.692
- He's such a fucking asshole.

39:37.693 --> 39:38.694
- Sam?

39:39.653 --> 39:40.987
Sam?

39:40.988 --> 39:42.781
You all right?

39:48.162 --> 39:51.956
Look, I see this all the time.

39:51.957 --> 39:56.003
If you don't do something,
it never ends good.

39:59.173 --> 40:01.007
- It'll be fine.

40:01.008 --> 40:03.009
Thank you.

40:03.010 --> 40:05.011
Can I get you something?

40:05.012 --> 40:06.513
A drink?

40:06.514 --> 40:07.931
- No, I'm good.

40:07.932 --> 40:09.182
<i>I</i> gotta go-

40:09.183 --> 40:11.351
Can I drop you somewhere?

40:11.352 --> 40:12.686
- Yeah, home.

40:14.271 --> 40:16.315
- You call me anytime.

40:19.985 --> 40:22.028
- When you gonna pitch a tent?

40:23.030 --> 40:24.113
- Mom.

40:24.114 --> 40:25.365
- What?

40:25.366 --> 40:27.826
I'm old, not dead.

40:27.827 --> 40:30.788
Need have a man
around the house.

40:32.164 --> 40:33.499
- I love you.

41:06.866 --> 41:09.117
- Hey, did you hear
what the town's

41:09.118 --> 41:10.702
doing to the school kids?

41:10.703 --> 41:13.079
Making them wear
the same uniforms.

41:13.080 --> 41:14.706
- Oh, I know.

41:14.707 --> 41:16.583
You know what, I think
it's a good idea.

41:16.584 --> 41:18.424
Who knows, they might
even study a little more.

41:19.712 --> 41:21.170
You know what,
I gotta get going.

41:21.171 --> 41:22.422
My mom's at home.

41:22.423 --> 41:24.090
- All right, see you, Sam.

41:24.091 --> 41:25.300
' See you.

42:09.094 --> 42:11.638
- Honestly, Jay, I'm
just so sick and tired

42:11.639 --> 42:15.266
of sneaking around like this.

42:15.267 --> 42:17.852
It's been two years now.

42:17.853 --> 42:20.104
I mean, how much more
time do you need?

42:20.105 --> 42:23.399
- I just need a
little more time.

42:23.400 --> 42:27.695
Listen, your brother's not
in a good place right now.

42:27.696 --> 42:30.156
I just have to be
careful with him.

42:30.157 --> 42:34.160
- I understand that my brother
is not doing well right now,

42:34.161 --> 42:38.873
but what does that have to do
with us and our relationship?

42:38.874 --> 42:41.751
- Amara, your brother
is addicted to drugs.

42:41.752 --> 42:43.544
Prostitutes,
gambling, everything.

42:43.545 --> 42:47.090
The Feds are on to him.

42:47.091 --> 42:49.717
They're probably out there
following him right now.

42:49.718 --> 42:53.096
I don't think I can
protect him anymore.

42:53.097 --> 42:56.891
- How long did you
know about this?

42:56.892 --> 42:59.102
Why didn't you say
anything to me about this?

42:59.103 --> 43:00.728
I mean, he's my brother.

43:00.729 --> 43:03.731
I need to do something
about this, okay?

43:03.732 --> 43:04.899
- I know. I know.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.609
- I can't just let...

43:06.610 --> 43:08.319
I can't just watch him
fall apart like this.

43:08.320 --> 43:09.529
- Listen, I just need
you to be prepared

43:09.530 --> 43:11.364
if shit hits the fan.

43:11.365 --> 43:12.408
Okay?

43:14.618 --> 43:17.370
Look, let's just
hope for the best,

43:17.371 --> 43:20.666
but we need to
prepare for the worst.

43:24.420 --> 43:25.421
I love you.

43:26.714 --> 43:28.172
You know that, right?

43:28.173 --> 43:29.174
- Yeah.

43:30.426 --> 43:33.344
- I'll do the best for us.

43:33.345 --> 43:34.346
Okay?

43:44.606 --> 43:45.649
Come here.

43:48.986 --> 43:50.778
I think the pizza's here.

43:55.451 --> 43:56.702
Go pay for it.

44:02.499 --> 44:03.500
- Hi.

44:06.503 --> 44:07.963
- $9.75, ma'am.

44:09.506 --> 44:11.257
- How did you get here?

44:11.258 --> 44:12.842
- Oh, I'm just two blocks away.

44:12.843 --> 44:14.678
It's not a big deal.

44:16.055 --> 44:18.514
- You know what, here you go.

44:18.515 --> 44:19.515
- Okay, thank you.

44:19.516 --> 44:20.808
- Thank you.

44:20.809 --> 44:23.312
- All right, have a good night.

44:31.487 --> 44:33.196
- Where you been at?

44:33.197 --> 44:35.364
Don't take no hour
to do one delivery.

44:35.365 --> 44:36.949
Huh?

44:36.950 --> 44:38.659
Been out getting
some air, Jordan?

44:38.660 --> 44:40.661
You do that ghetto shit
on your time, okay?

44:40.662 --> 44:42.371
Your job is simple.

44:42.372 --> 44:45.792
I give you food and
you give me money.

44:45.793 --> 44:47.293
Simple shit, boy.

44:47.294 --> 44:48.920
- So you think it's ghetto

44:48.921 --> 44:50.880
that I just did 27
deliveries today?

44:50.881 --> 44:52.590
You know, yesterday
I was this close

44:52.591 --> 44:54.258
to doubling that amount?

44:54.259 --> 44:55.676
But I guess that shit's
ghetto two, right?

44:55.677 --> 44:57.512
- You want a fucking medal?

44:57.513 --> 44:59.222
- Yeah, I do.

44:59.223 --> 45:00.723
- You know how much
this place costs me?

45:00.724 --> 45:02.433
Now I gotta do
twice as much work,

45:02.434 --> 45:06.562
doing damage control on
everything you fuck up.

45:06.563 --> 45:08.564
I'm supposed to clean
up after your shit?

45:08.565 --> 45:10.566
I don't think so.

45:10.567 --> 45:11.692
- Fuck that shit, man.

45:11.693 --> 45:13.194
'Quit!

45:13.195 --> 45:15.571
Now you can cleanup
after my shit.

45:15.572 --> 45:16.739
. Okay-

45:16.740 --> 45:18.616
Obama's America.

45:18.617 --> 45:19.617
- Yeah.

45:19.618 --> 45:20.743
- See,

45:20.744 --> 45:23.329
y'all don't wanna work.

45:23.330 --> 45:25.832
Now pick that up
and do your job!

45:25.833 --> 45:28.292
- This ain't slavery days, man.

45:28.293 --> 45:31.712
And you don't pay me enough to put up
with your racist, redneck bullshit.

45:31.713 --> 45:34.257
So you can kiss my
motherfucking black ass.

45:34.258 --> 45:36.634
- I ain't kissing
your black nothing.

45:36.635 --> 45:41.223
You just a lazy ass nigger.

45:48.397 --> 45:50.106
He hit me!

45:50.107 --> 45:53.067
- You piece of shit nigger.
- I'm calling the cops.

45:53.068 --> 45:55.570
- What the fuck you say to me, white boy?
- Call the cops.

45:55.571 --> 45:57.280
You better run.

45:57.281 --> 45:58.531
- Give me my money.

45:58.532 --> 45:59.657
- Oh, you want your money?

45:59.658 --> 46:01.450
Huh?

46:01.451 --> 46:03.119
This little lousy ass
fucking chump change?

46:03.120 --> 46:04.370
Here!

46:04.371 --> 46:06.205
Take that fucking money.

46:06.206 --> 46:08.583
Shove it up the pasty
white ass of yours.

46:08.584 --> 46:09.585
Bitch!

46:10.961 --> 46:13.338
- Yo, that nigger hit me.

46:26.977 --> 46:28.186
- See those hands!

46:28.187 --> 46:29.187
See your hands! Hands up!

46:29.188 --> 46:30.479
Keep them up!

46:30.480 --> 46:32.231
- Okay, okay! Just don't shoot.

46:32.232 --> 46:33.232
- Turn around and
get against the wall!

46:33.233 --> 46:34.817
- Okay, okay!

46:34.818 --> 46:36.068
- Put your hands on the wall.

46:36.069 --> 46:37.361
- Just please, don't shoot me.

46:37.362 --> 46:39.030
- You have any guns on you?

46:39.031 --> 46:40.031
- Please, can you tell
me what this is about?

46:40.032 --> 46:41.032
Why?

46:44.161 --> 46:45.661
- Stop resisting.

46:45.662 --> 46:48.373
Stop resisting.
Don't you resist.

46:50.834 --> 46:52.126
Stand up.

47:00.344 --> 47:02.304
In route to the jail.

47:06.516 --> 47:07.725
Detective Magio.

47:07.726 --> 47:08.851
Be advised,

47:08.852 --> 47:10.061
suspect Jordan Cox,

47:10.062 --> 47:11.896
booked on battery charges.

47:11.897 --> 47:15.441
Matches prints from two
of your recent homicides.

47:15.442 --> 47:17.443
Be advised.

47:17.444 --> 47:19.946
Suspect Jordan Cox is known
to have had a relationship

47:19.947 --> 47:23.825
with recent homicide
victim, Maria Cooper.

47:29.456 --> 47:31.833
- Look at these pictures.

47:34.294 --> 47:36.713
You recognize those girls?

47:46.974 --> 47:49.559
- I don't know them people.

47:51.561 --> 47:54.522
- Maybe you oughta
take another look.

47:54.523 --> 47:56.107
- I just looked at it.

47:56.108 --> 47:58.442
Like I told you
before, I don't know.

47:58.443 --> 48:00.194
- You're the prime suspect.

48:00.195 --> 48:01.946
- Really?

48:01.947 --> 48:03.072
- Yeah.

48:03.073 --> 48:04.365
We know you did it.

48:04.366 --> 48:05.950
What I wanna know is why.

48:05.951 --> 48:07.368
- Why what?

48:07.369 --> 48:08.661
- Why did you kill these girls?

48:08.662 --> 48:11.414
- I didn't kill nobody, man!

48:11.415 --> 48:13.416
Look, I swear to God...

48:13.417 --> 48:14.542
- Don't you swear.

48:14.543 --> 48:15.626
- Oh, okay.

48:15.627 --> 48:17.129
I promise to God.

48:19.131 --> 48:20.631
- Let me help you out.

48:20.632 --> 48:22.008
- Oh, you wanna
help me out again.

48:22.009 --> 48:23.301
- Yeah, I'll help you out.

48:23.302 --> 48:24.552
- What you got for me this time?

48:24.553 --> 48:25.845
- You go over to her house

48:25.846 --> 48:27.305
because you wanna fuck her.

48:27.306 --> 48:28.681
You ring the doorbell.

48:28.682 --> 48:31.351
She answers and she says no.

48:32.269 --> 48:33.477
Who knows why.

48:33.478 --> 48:34.813
Maybe you do.

48:35.981 --> 48:37.565
She says no.

48:37.566 --> 48:39.317
You get mad, lose your temper.

48:39.318 --> 48:40.985
Next thing you know, she's dead.

48:40.986 --> 48:42.695
- What do you want me to say?

48:42.696 --> 48:44.447
I don't even know what
you're talking about!

48:44.448 --> 48:46.449
God damn.

48:46.450 --> 48:47.742
- We know you were fucking
at least one of these girls.

48:47.743 --> 48:49.035
And the sooner you admit it

48:49.036 --> 48:50.369
sign a confession!

48:50.370 --> 48:51.912
You admit you did it.

48:51.913 --> 48:53.539
We'll be able to plea bargain.

48:53.540 --> 48:55.249
We can help you out.

48:55.250 --> 48:57.460
Now you keep this shit up,

48:57.461 --> 49:00.087
get dragged in front
of a jury for murder,

49:00.088 --> 49:03.591
they will chew you up and
spit your black ass out.

49:03.592 --> 49:06.635
You'll be lucky to get life.

49:06.636 --> 49:08.220
- Like I told you before,

49:08.221 --> 49:09.513
I didn't have shit
to do with these

49:09.514 --> 49:11.265
white women getting killed.

49:11.266 --> 49:13.142
How many goddamn ways
I can tell you that?

49:14.519 --> 49:16.228
Seriously?

49:16.229 --> 49:17.480
The only suspect you can
find was my black ass,

49:17.481 --> 49:18.647
because of a fingerprint?

49:18.648 --> 49:20.900
Give me a break, man.

49:35.957 --> 49:36.958
- Harry.

49:42.964 --> 49:45.008
- You need to think
about your attitude.

49:49.137 --> 49:50.805
- What the hell is
going on with you?

49:50.806 --> 49:51.847
- What?

49:51.848 --> 49:53.474
- This.

49:53.475 --> 49:54.809
- I got an admitted
violent offender

49:54.810 --> 49:56.602
with prints all over my case.

49:56.603 --> 49:58.145
- Really? Prints? Prints?

49:58.146 --> 49:59.647
He's a fucking delivery boy.

49:59.648 --> 50:01.983
His prints are on
every doorknob.

50:06.154 --> 50:09.198
You know, I can't
deal with you anymore.

50:09.199 --> 50:13.202
I am so tired of picking up
your reckless detective work.

50:13.203 --> 50:14.995
Picking up the pieces.

50:14.996 --> 50:16.539
You're a mess out there.

50:16.540 --> 50:19.250
I'm just so done
with you, Harry.

50:19.251 --> 50:21.962
You need to take some time off.

50:23.505 --> 50:24.631
- Fuck you.

50:27.634 --> 50:29.636
- You're free to go.

50:30.804 --> 50:32.639
Harry, take time off.

50:33.557 --> 50:35.266
Go.

50:35.267 --> 50:36.851
- You don't tell me what to do.

50:36.852 --> 50:37.894
- Harry.

50:41.940 --> 50:45.110
- Stay the fuck
out of my business.

50:56.663 --> 51:00.500
- Come with
me and get your stuff.

51:09.926 --> 51:11.720
- Hey, come here.

51:12.721 --> 51:13.930
Come on.

51:16.683 --> 51:17.809
Sorry.

51:27.319 --> 51:29.320
Listen.

51:29.321 --> 51:33.073
I know we said some
shitty things before,

51:33.074 --> 51:35.117
but we're always
gonna love each other,

51:35.118 --> 51:36.119
right?

51:41.708 --> 51:42.958
- Yeah.

51:42.959 --> 51:44.002
Sorry.

51:51.718 --> 51:54.553
- Sign here.

51:54.554 --> 51:57.516
- I get harassed and now I
gotta sign for my own stuff?

52:01.937 --> 52:03.188
- I got him.

52:04.689 --> 52:06.858
Sorry about the mix up.

52:21.790 --> 52:23.499
- Now you have a problem.

52:23.500 --> 52:27.503
- Don't change the
fucking topic, Andreas.

52:27.504 --> 52:31.632
You gonna do what I asked
you to do or what, man?

52:31.633 --> 52:34.260
Get the fuck out of here.

52:34.261 --> 52:36.095
- Look dude.

52:36.096 --> 52:38.138
I don't think you fucking
understand, my man.

52:38.139 --> 52:41.517
If I don't get what I want,
I'm gonna fucking smoke you.

52:57.367 --> 52:59.743
- I know he's cruising
the streets right now,

52:59.744 --> 53:01.996
looking for his next victim.

53:04.207 --> 53:05.791
- Finally decided to...

53:05.792 --> 53:06.959
Hey.

53:06.960 --> 53:08.669
- Good evening, ma'am.

53:08.670 --> 53:11.255
I'm in charge of
maintenance around here.

53:11.256 --> 53:14.383
Seems there might be a
plumbing problem in your room.

53:14.384 --> 53:16.302
Water's leaking in next door

53:16.303 --> 53:18.596
and we think it might be
coming from your bathroom.

53:18.597 --> 53:21.932
- I know you're
doing business on Facebook, bro.

53:21.933 --> 53:24.686
I'm not fucking stupid. Okay?

53:25.979 --> 53:29.148
- You mind if I take a look?

53:29.149 --> 53:34.194
- I haven't heard anything
or seen any water.

53:34.195 --> 53:38.616
Maybe somebody came by
already and fixed it.

53:38.617 --> 53:40.326
- They would've told me.

53:40.327 --> 53:42.870
Seeing as I only live
a few miles from here.

53:50.670 --> 53:53.631
You work around these parts?

53:53.632 --> 53:54.923
- Yeah.

53:54.924 --> 53:57.510
I work at the mini-mart in town.

53:58.845 --> 54:00.096
I'm a cashier.

54:03.683 --> 54:05.017
- Nice to meet you.

54:05.018 --> 54:06.644
My name's Bill.

54:06.645 --> 54:07.646
And you?

54:09.564 --> 54:10.565
- I'm Janet.

54:19.074 --> 54:22.076
♪ Just give them what they need

54:22.077 --> 54:23.786
♪ Just take heed

54:23.787 --> 54:25.079
♪ I got my mind right

54:25.080 --> 54:26.538
♪ My money next

54:26.539 --> 54:28.874
♪ And when the time right ♪

54:28.875 --> 54:31.418
- Can this wait 'til tomorrow?

54:31.419 --> 54:35.382
My ex is supposed to be
coming by any minute.

54:37.300 --> 54:41.095
- I think it's best
if I take a look.

54:46.893 --> 54:47.936
. Okay-

54:49.729 --> 54:50.730
Come on in.

54:52.023 --> 54:54.734
You could just make it quick.

54:57.737 --> 55:00.781
Where do you think
it might be leaking?

56:18.401 --> 56:19.902
- Good morning?

56:19.903 --> 56:21.320
Morning.

56:21.321 --> 56:22.905
- Don't shoot!

56:22.906 --> 56:25.408
- You want me to
come back later?

56:26.701 --> 56:27.951
- Just give me a minute.

56:27.952 --> 56:29.204
- All right.

57:05.990 --> 57:09.244
- Hey, don't you
owe me some money?

57:13.122 --> 57:16.083
- A man of my word.

57:16.084 --> 57:18.085
Now I know that's
not payment in full,

57:18.086 --> 57:22.089
but hopefully that'll do
until I can get a job.

57:22.090 --> 57:23.382
- This is it?

57:23.383 --> 57:25.092
This is all you can give me?

57:25.093 --> 57:27.679
- That's all I got right now.

57:43.820 --> 57:46.446
Yes, I'm calling about the ad.

57:46.447 --> 57:48.199
Yes, Jordan.

57:49.617 --> 57:51.202
Address please?

57:53.580 --> 57:54.746
Thank you. Thank you.

57:54.747 --> 57:56.164
- Oh my god!

57:57.667 --> 57:59.001
Oh my god, help!

57:59.002 --> 58:00.168
Help!

58:00.169 --> 58:01.420
Oh my god! Oh my god!

58:01.421 --> 58:02.671
Somebody call the police.

58:02.672 --> 58:03.672
There's blood everywhere!

58:14.601 --> 58:16.226
- 911, what's your emergency?

58:16.227 --> 58:18.061
- Get the police here!

58:18.062 --> 58:20.063
My maid saw a lot of
blood in one of the rooms.

58:20.064 --> 58:21.523
- Yes, ma'am.

58:21.524 --> 58:23.567
Send them quickly.

58:23.568 --> 58:24.818
- Ma'am,
can you give me your address?

58:24.819 --> 58:26.111
- Town and Country Motel,

58:26.112 --> 58:27.237
on Texas Street.

58:29.198 --> 58:31.241
Headquarters to Detective Magio

58:31.242 --> 58:34.912
and all units in the area of
the Town and Country Motel.

58:34.913 --> 58:37.539
Units, be in route to the
Town and Country Hotel

58:37.540 --> 58:40.250
in reference to a 911 call.

58:57.644 --> 58:59.269
- Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

58:59.270 --> 59:01.396
My cleaning lady
saw a lot of blood.

59:01.397 --> 59:02.481
It's in room 124.

59:02.482 --> 59:04.317
- We'll take a look.

59:36.641 --> 59:38.434
Tape it off, guys.

01:00:12.218 --> 01:00:17.055
- This god damn nigger stole
five grand from me, man.

01:00:17.056 --> 01:00:19.641
I know exactly
where he keeps it.

01:00:19.642 --> 01:00:22.436
You kill his black ass,

01:00:22.437 --> 01:00:24.731
you keep that five grand.

01:00:29.068 --> 01:00:33.448
- Now you make me work twice
my own motherfucking money.

01:00:35.658 --> 01:00:36.700
Alright, fine.

01:00:36.701 --> 01:00:38.036
I'mma do this.

01:00:40.121 --> 01:00:42.289
But let's set an example
what happens the next time

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:44.499
you don't have my
motherfucking money.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.501
- Yo, here he comes, man.

01:00:46.502 --> 01:00:47.795
Kick his ass.

01:00:55.511 --> 01:00:56.512
Kick his ass.

01:01:02.185 --> 01:01:04.436
- Excuse me. Hey.

01:01:04.437 --> 01:01:06.772
Hey partner, you got a light?

01:01:10.943 --> 01:01:12.819
- As long as you promise
not to run off with it.

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.238
- Oh man, it's your lighter.

01:01:15.239 --> 01:01:18.034
Thank you. Thank you, really.

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:28.210
You usually run off
with people's money?

01:01:28.211 --> 01:01:29.669
- Do I know you?

01:01:32.924 --> 01:01:34.007
- It don't matter, man.

01:01:34.008 --> 01:01:35.551
- Son of a bitch.

01:02:12.672 --> 01:02:14.882
- Are you okay, sweetie?

01:02:17.677 --> 01:02:19.386
- What?

01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:21.263
- Do you need me to get
you something to drink?

01:02:21.264 --> 01:02:23.974
- No, I'm good. Thanks.

01:02:23.975 --> 01:02:26.017
So did you hear anything?

01:02:26.018 --> 01:02:27.395
See anything?

01:02:28.563 --> 01:02:30.522
- No, nothing.

01:02:30.523 --> 01:02:32.023
The first thing we heard
was when the maid screamed.

01:02:32.024 --> 01:02:33.942
. Okay'

01:02:33.943 --> 01:02:36.319
I'm going need a complete
list of all your guests.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.697
Names, contact information.

01:02:38.698 --> 01:02:39.698
- All of them?

01:02:39.699 --> 01:02:40.740
- All of them.

01:02:40.741 --> 01:02:42.325
- Everybody?

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:44.119
- Please, get it printed out

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.912
and give it to the one
officer that will be here.

01:02:45.913 --> 01:02:47.873
Tell him I asked for it.

01:02:47.874 --> 01:02:49.958
Now if you think anything
else, call me all right?

01:02:49.959 --> 01:02:53.044
- Okay. Thank you.

01:02:53.045 --> 01:02:56.423
- Ma'am, could you
spare few dollars?

01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:58.676
Kind of hungry you know?

01:03:00.178 --> 01:03:01.637
Appreciate it.

01:03:03.222 --> 01:03:04.849
Thank you so much.

01:03:08.227 --> 01:03:09.895
- Is there
any other characteristics

01:03:09.896 --> 01:03:12.772
that you can expand
on that you have found

01:03:12.773 --> 01:03:15.066
that is common amongst
serial killers?

01:03:15.067 --> 01:03:19.321
Can you give us any picture
of what this guy looks like?

01:03:19.322 --> 01:03:21.031
What he's thinking?

01:03:21.032 --> 01:03:22.490
- A lot of times
you might think he's

01:03:22.491 --> 01:03:24.409
some scruffy looking character.

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:27.037
He doesn't rob them,
so it's not the money.

01:03:27.038 --> 01:03:29.122
Money is not the
object of this thing

01:03:29.123 --> 01:03:32.959
and really it's just the way
that he gets his jollies.

01:03:44.096 --> 01:03:45.222
- What's up, man?

01:03:45.223 --> 01:03:46.848
You got some stuff?

01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:48.476
All right, cool.

01:05:26.032 --> 01:05:27.742
- We won't be long.

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:41.130
This car is badass.

01:05:54.769 --> 01:05:57.103
- I got to tell you, detective,

01:05:57.104 --> 01:05:59.482
I've been a real bad girl.

01:06:08.616 --> 01:06:10.116
- I'll give you a ride home.

01:06:10.117 --> 01:06:11.951
- I don't want to
go home, Harry.

01:06:11.952 --> 01:06:13.286
I want to talk.

01:06:13.287 --> 01:06:14.537
- Talk about what?

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:16.373
- About us. You and me.

01:06:16.374 --> 01:06:17.416
Sit down.

01:06:24.173 --> 01:06:26.008
Still nothing to say?

01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:31.055
Dammit, I need more, Harry.

01:06:33.933 --> 01:06:37.186
You want to be with
me or you don't?

01:06:39.355 --> 01:06:40.939
- Where you going?

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.649
- What the fuck do
you care, Harry?

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:45.276
- Come on, you can't
walk out from here.

01:06:45.277 --> 01:06:46.528
- Get the fuck off me.

01:06:46.529 --> 01:06:47.862
What are you doing?

01:06:47.863 --> 01:06:49.197
- Christ, look where you are.

01:06:49.198 --> 01:06:50.615
You won't make it three blocks.

01:06:50.616 --> 01:06:51.741
- Fuck you, Harry.

01:06:51.742 --> 01:06:52.867
- I'll give you a ride.

01:06:52.868 --> 01:06:54.869
- Let me go! Let me go!

01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:57.832
- I'm gonna give
you a ride home.

01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:01.251
- Harry, put me down.

01:07:01.252 --> 01:07:02.627
Fucking asshole.

01:07:02.628 --> 01:07:03.920
Put me down!

01:07:03.921 --> 01:07:06.339
Fuck! Put me down!

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:07.591
Put me down.

01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:15.682
- Oh, shit.

01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:16.975
What is you doing?

01:07:16.976 --> 01:07:17.976
- Sorry man, that's my bad.

01:07:17.977 --> 01:07:18.977
You all right?

01:07:18.978 --> 01:07:19.979
- Yeah.

01:07:21.647 --> 01:07:24.108
- You got a buck in there?

01:07:26.569 --> 01:07:28.069
- What do I owe you?

01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:30.656
- Just give me,
like, four bucks.

01:07:32.616 --> 01:07:33.868
- Here's five.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.791
Thanks, man.

01:07:44.128 --> 01:07:45.670
Stay out of trouble, all right?

01:07:45.671 --> 01:07:46.754
- All right.

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:52.428
Damn, he tried to kill me, man.

01:08:18.662 --> 01:08:20.872
- Can I get a whisky?

01:08:22.416 --> 01:08:23.416
- There you go.

01:08:23.417 --> 01:08:24.460
- Thanks.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.433
- You
girls be careful out there.

01:08:40.434 --> 01:08:43.978
We'll be fine, daddy.

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:49.943
I love you.

01:08:49.944 --> 01:08:52.529
Love you too.

01:08:58.493 --> 01:08:59.537
- Allison?

01:09:02.915 --> 01:09:04.499
Babe?

01:09:19.682 --> 01:09:20.724
Allison!

01:09:39.827 --> 01:09:41.077
Attention all units,

01:09:41.078 --> 01:09:42.745
this is Detective Maggio.

01:09:54.883 --> 01:09:57.093
- You know what
Harry? I am done.

01:09:57.094 --> 01:10:00.597
Hell, everyone is done with you.

01:10:00.598 --> 01:10:02.599
You know what? I shouldn't
even tell you this

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.977
but the FBI has been
investigating you.

01:10:05.978 --> 01:10:09.063
And I am glad because
for the past two years

01:10:09.064 --> 01:10:11.899
everyone that loves you
has been watching you

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:14.569
fuck your life up!

01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:15.737
So go ahead,

01:10:15.738 --> 01:10:17.780
drink up, party away!

01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:18.991
Have fun.

01:10:24.788 --> 01:10:27.458
- You think I'm having fun?!

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:32.045
In the last year,

01:10:32.046 --> 01:10:35.840
I've seen eleven murdered women.

01:10:35.841 --> 01:10:39.385
Eleven women I didn't save,

01:10:39.386 --> 01:10:42.847
just like I didn't save Allison.

01:10:42.848 --> 01:10:44.140
' Harry.

01:10:44.141 --> 01:10:46.185
- And every time I see one.

01:10:47.102 --> 01:10:48.395
I see Allison.

01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:52.482
And poof!

01:10:52.483 --> 01:10:53.484
She's gone.

01:10:54.777 --> 01:10:57.738
She's everywhere. She's nowhere.

01:10:58.781 --> 01:10:59.864
- Harry.

01:10:59.865 --> 01:11:01.158
- I lose Allison

01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:03.369
and my child.

01:11:05.329 --> 01:11:07.915
My fucking unborn daughter.

01:11:11.752 --> 01:11:13.753
Ten times a day!

01:11:13.754 --> 01:11:16.090
I lose her ten times a day!

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.218
And that ain't fun!

01:11:20.219 --> 01:11:22.845
That ain't fucking fun!

01:11:22.846 --> 01:11:24.305
- Harry.

01:14:38.876 --> 01:14:40.710
- Hey, Mr. Cain.

01:14:40.711 --> 01:14:43.713
Got some more bags for you.

01:14:43.714 --> 01:14:45.464
- Good work, kid.

01:14:45.465 --> 01:14:46.507
Be right back.

01:14:46.508 --> 01:14:47.551
. Okay-

01:15:02.858 --> 01:15:04.609
Might wanna clean up in here.

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:06.320
Smells pretty bad.

01:15:08.488 --> 01:15:10.073
- Yeah, I know.

01:15:11.199 --> 01:15:13.284
Must be a dead rat.

01:15:14.453 --> 01:15:15.453
Here you go.

01:15:15.454 --> 01:15:16.662
- Thank you.

01:15:16.663 --> 01:15:18.039
- Keep up the good work.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.040
- Will do.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:31.761
- Hey, bud.

01:15:31.762 --> 01:15:33.054
- Hey Harry, it's Jeremy.

01:15:33.055 --> 01:15:34.889
I'm really sorry to bother you,

01:15:34.890 --> 01:15:36.974
but I was just over at Caine's
garage on Airline drive

01:15:36.975 --> 01:15:38.643
and I saw some
blood on the ground

01:15:38.644 --> 01:15:41.062
and it smelled extremely bad.

01:15:41.063 --> 01:15:42.855
I just wanted to
let you know that.

01:15:42.856 --> 01:15:45.399
- All right, look,
I gotta get cleaned up.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.651
Thanks for the tip.

01:15:46.652 --> 01:15:47.777
I'll check it out.

01:15:47.778 --> 01:15:49.655
- Okay. See you soon.

01:16:30.988 --> 01:16:32.321
- I can pay you.

01:16:32.322 --> 01:16:33.990
I can pay you. I have money.

01:16:33.991 --> 01:16:35.391
I have money. I can
pay you, please.

01:16:37.369 --> 01:16:38.369
- Come on.

01:16:42.791 --> 01:16:45.418
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:59.098
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:16:59.099 --> 01:17:00.934
My little kitty cat.

01:17:02.436 --> 01:17:03.687
Come up here.

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:06.356
Come up here.

01:17:13.155 --> 01:17:14.655
Headquarters to 601.

01:17:14.656 --> 01:17:17.533
Detective Maggie?

01:17:17.534 --> 01:17:22.580
Headquarters to Detective
Maggio across all channels.

01:17:22.581 --> 01:17:24.874
- Wanna go for a walk?

01:17:24.875 --> 01:17:26.751
You wanna go for a walk?

01:17:26.752 --> 01:17:29.045
Is that what you want?

01:17:29.046 --> 01:17:31.505
I know what you want.

01:17:31.506 --> 01:17:32.548
Is this what you want?

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:40.514
Feels good, my little kitty cat.

01:17:40.515 --> 01:17:42.808
Feels good. Come here.

01:17:42.809 --> 01:17:43.852
Come here.

01:17:44.936 --> 01:17:46.520
Is that what you want?

01:17:51.985 --> 01:17:54.487
Do you want a drink, sweetie?

01:18:03.163 --> 01:18:04.538
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:18:12.714 --> 01:18:14.091
- No.

01:18:15.717 --> 01:18:17.052
- Easy, easy.

01:18:18.178 --> 01:18:19.721
My little kitty cat.

01:18:41.243 --> 01:18:44.496
I think it's your
bedtime. Isn't it?

01:18:45.914 --> 01:18:49.333
You have been a bad girl.

01:18:49.334 --> 01:18:52.837
I think it's your bed time.

01:19:01.179 --> 01:19:03.222
- Headquarters
to Detective Maggio.

01:19:03.223 --> 01:19:04.558
Are you 1092?

01:19:49.603 --> 01:19:51.020
- Shit.

01:21:02.842 --> 01:21:04.677
- Bossier
City Police are reporting

01:21:04.678 --> 01:21:06.679
the capture of long
sought after bayou killer

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.223
believed responsible for as
many as 11 grizzly murders

01:21:09.224 --> 01:21:11.058
in the last year.

01:21:11.059 --> 01:21:13.018
The suspected serial
killer has been identified

01:21:13.019 --> 01:21:16.438
as Bill Cain, the 37 years
old owner of Cain's Garage

01:21:16.439 --> 01:21:18.065
in Bossier City.

01:21:18.066 --> 01:21:19.858
Little was known about
the suspect other than

01:21:19.859 --> 01:21:21.819
he was an only child who
grew up in Bossier City

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:24.071
and inherited the
garage from his father.

01:21:24.072 --> 01:21:26.407
The suspect was identified
by the lead investigator

01:21:26.408 --> 01:21:28.826
in the case, Detective
Harry Maggio,

01:21:28.827 --> 01:21:30.786
who suffered a
severe head injury

01:21:30.787 --> 01:21:33.122
during the dramatic rescue
of a potential 12th victim

01:21:33.123 --> 01:21:35.207
at Cain's Garage.

01:21:35.208 --> 01:21:37.001
We are happy to say that he
is expected to fully recover

01:21:37.002 --> 01:21:39.003
with no lasting effects
from the injury.

01:21:39.004 --> 01:21:42.006
However, sources tell us
an internal investigation

01:21:42.007 --> 01:21:44.216
has been launched
involving Detective Maggio.

01:21:44.217 --> 01:21:46.593
While we don't know the
specifics of this investigation,

01:21:46.594 --> 01:21:49.388
rumors state that
the investigation may

01:21:49.389 --> 01:21:51.056
of serious misconduct,

01:21:51.057 --> 01:21:53.475
including narcotics
and prostitution.

01:21:53.476 --> 01:21:55.227
We have also been
informed that due to

01:21:55.228 --> 01:21:57.021
the serious nature of
this investigation,

01:21:57.022 --> 01:21:59.023
the Bossier City Police
have involved the FBI

01:21:59.024 --> 01:22:02.026
in their investigation
of Detective Maggio.

01:22:35.268 --> 01:22:37.144
- I hope you like charburgers.

01:22:37.145 --> 01:22:39.021
- I love charburgers.

01:22:39.022 --> 01:22:40.105
Come on, eat.

01:22:40.106 --> 01:22:41.231
Here you go, dad.

01:22:41.232 --> 01:22:42.316
- Thank you, Amara.

01:22:42.317 --> 01:22:43.359
- You're welcome.

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.360
- Hey mom.

01:22:44.361 --> 01:22:45.487
. Hey, baby.

01:22:47.155 --> 01:22:49.281
- How you doing, son?

01:22:49.282 --> 01:22:50.282
- I'm good.

01:22:50.283 --> 01:22:51.325
- You okay?

01:22:51.326 --> 01:22:52.409
- I'm all right.

01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:53.702
One day at a time.

01:22:53.703 --> 01:22:54.828
- One day at a time.

01:22:54.829 --> 01:22:55.829
- Hey, Uncle Harry.

01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:57.122
- Hey man.

01:22:57.123 --> 01:22:58.123
- Can I have a couple dollars?

01:22:58.124 --> 01:22:59.458
- Why?

01:22:59.459 --> 01:23:00.459
Gonna buy another video game?

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:01.627
- Ice cream.

01:23:01.628 --> 01:23:02.796
- That's a good idea.

01:23:05.924 --> 01:23:07.508
- Hey, you still got it.

01:23:07.509 --> 01:23:08.717
- Yeah.

01:23:08.718 --> 01:23:10.677
That's the lucky dollar.

01:23:10.678 --> 01:23:12.554
You should hang on to that one.

01:23:12.555 --> 01:23:13.681
- Sweet.

01:23:14.599 --> 01:23:16.809
Thank you.

01:23:16.810 --> 01:23:22.648
Headquarters to 207 and 201.

01:23:22.649 --> 01:23:26.527
The suspect, Harry Maggio,
is at that location.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:34.034
Units, the suspect is to be
considered armed and dangerous.

01:23:36.996 --> 01:23:38.581
Be in route with 209.
