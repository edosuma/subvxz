- Since when do you care?

you through that fucking wall!

Oh, man, I was actually
gonna go for once.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.668
Why the hell don't they have school?

00:42.751 --> 00:45.629

City learning the metric system.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.922
Metric system?

home with the kids.

- I don't know.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.422
Perhaps she's marrying
the ketchup bottles.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.594
- Hey. Let's go.
- Without paying?

11:17.677 --> 11:21.180
- That's against the rules!
- Who are you, my dad?

11:21.264 --> 11:23.266
Screw him and screw the rules.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.311
I'm tired of being good.
Where's that ever gotten me?

11:26.394 --> 11:28.980
At breakfast with a dear friend?

11:29.063 --> 11:31.149
You can stick around if you want,

11:31.232 --> 11:34.068
but I'm leaving and I'm not paying.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.907
I feel dirty!

11:38.990 --> 11:40.533
Ah!

11:40.617 --> 11:43.161
[Pogo] Oh, yeah. Oh.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.913
[chewing]

11:44.996 --> 11:49.584
Oh, this old chocolate bar tastes
like shit, but it is so good!

11:50.752 --> 11:56.341
Oh, man... if they hadn't removed the
nipple that grew inside my cheek,

11:56.424 --> 11:58.259
it'd be hard as a rock.

11:58.343 --> 12:02.639
Bob, you can have the whole box of
stales, but I got to finish my route.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.642
- I promised Sue I'd be home by noon.
- Sure, sure.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.937
Oh, God.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.355
[Roger] Bob Pogo!

12:10.730 --> 12:14.609
Where are you, you
incompetent water buffalo?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.277
Aw, Christ. It's Dunbarton.

12:16.361 --> 12:21.324
Why in the fuck did you tell my nephew
to throw suitcases into a jet engine?

12:21.407 --> 12:24.035
Frank, get me out of here
until things calm down!

12:24.118 --> 12:25.995
- What?
- I can't defend myself

12:26.079 --> 12:28.623
against that kind of crazy!
Please! Drive!

12:28.706 --> 12:30.500
- Bob, I...
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

12:30.583 --> 12:32.335
Okay! Okay! Hang onto something!

12:35.672 --> 12:37.131
[Kevin] Two and a half hours.

12:37.215 --> 12:41.636
Almost enough time to calmly prepare
for my life to change forever.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.806
Just relax and meet your destiny.

12:48.518 --> 12:52.397
Yes, but of course I have a condom.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.107
Is this what you're looking for?

12:55.441 --> 12:56.651
Latex, my dear?

12:58.778 --> 13:01.114
You like that? Am I doing it right?

13:01.197 --> 13:02.532
Oh, yeah, baby.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.452
That's right, we're doing this.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.372
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're welcome.
You're welcome. You're welcome.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.505
That burns my dick.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.133
[Kevin screams]

13:22.593 --> 13:25.805
Pogo, if you hate working with
Scoop so much, why don't you quit?

13:25.888 --> 13:28.474
I can't. My marriage wouldn't survive.

13:28.558 --> 13:32.770
Dolores nursed me through five heart
attacks and three "tub stucks,"

13:32.854 --> 13:34.480
but this one might break her.

13:34.564 --> 13:37.442
- Get a job with another airline.
- Doing what?

13:37.525 --> 13:41.738
My only skills are sitting behind a
desk and pissing in a coffee can.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.490
You're the one who knows how
to run a baggage department.

13:44.574 --> 13:45.825
What about Rosie?

13:45.908 --> 13:48.077
Now's not the time for jokes, Frank.

13:48.536 --> 13:52.665
I mean it, you could come back to
Mohican today and not miss a...

13:54.834 --> 13:58.004
Frank, I've got a proposition for you.

13:58.087 --> 14:02.175
Help me get rid of Scoop and I'll
make Dunbarton hire you back.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.094
- Are you crazy?
- I'm desperate!

14:05.178 --> 14:07.430
And Dunbarton is a businessman.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.016
The airline is hemorrhaging
money, thanks to Scoop,

14:10.099 --> 14:12.935
and he's too vain to
admit he made a mistake.

14:13.019 --> 14:17.565
But if you stepped in to run things
the right way, even just for a day,

14:17.648 --> 14:21.569
instead of that idiot, he'd see
the light and bring you back.

14:23.488 --> 14:28.951
If it were humanly possible for me
to get down on my knees, I would.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.580
Please, help me and help yourself.

14:33.498 --> 14:38.461
Bob, if you had asked me two weeks
ago, I probably would have said yes.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.672
But I got a job now
where I'm appreciated.

14:41.756 --> 14:45.468
And I'm not under the thumb of a
miserable prick like Dunbarton

14:45.551 --> 14:47.845
who humiliated me in front of my family!

14:48.971 --> 14:52.642
So, thanks for the offer, but
my answer is no. Fuck no.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.313
[truck door opens]

14:57.397 --> 15:01.734
Now, if you'll excuse me, this high
school needs their cigarettes.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.863
[inhales deeply]

15:05.947 --> 15:08.157
[screams]

15:08.241 --> 15:10.868
[Vivian] Okay, no one
can hear us in here.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.871
I spoke to Nikos, my guy
down at the plastic plant.

15:13.955 --> 15:17.166
He's got four fingers and he
still has his baby teeth,

15:17.250 --> 15:19.794
but he can assemble us a
prototype on the sly.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.379
[Sue] But I already made a prototype.

15:21.462 --> 15:25.258
[Vivian] We need a real prototype,
something made out of actual plastic.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.665
We can't present the
founder of Plast-a-Ware

15:27.714 --> 15:29.398
with a rusty washing machine.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.181
- [Sue sighs] Okay, I'm in.
- Great.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.016
Now, we have to move fast.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.232
Nikos can only do it tonight,
and it's gonna cost us.

15:37.285 --> 15:38.745
Three hundred bucks total.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.691
You need to get me your
half by the end of the day.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.485
[Sue] Today? A hundred fifty?

15:44.569 --> 15:46.571
I could have Frank bring what
I've got saved up at home,

15:46.654 --> 15:48.197
but that's a whole lot of money.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.825
[Vivian] Either that or you
give Nikos your dirty panties

15:50.908 --> 15:52.326
and a Polaroid of your cooter.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.536
[Sue] I'll get the money!

15:59.792 --> 16:01.002
[camera flash]

16:02.962 --> 16:05.590
- Now to pay for my transmission.
- [camera flash]

16:09.177 --> 16:12.096
You shouldn't have done that.
You had the money.

16:12.180 --> 16:15.933
And now I still have the money.
That felt so good!

16:16.017 --> 16:18.311
I have a full belly and $11.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.646
And Christ, I have to take a piss.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.192
This is Jimmy's old fort!

16:24.275 --> 16:26.152
You can't pee on it. He'll haunt us.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.113
He can't touch us. I made him disappear.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.448
Forever.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.074
Come on, feel the freedom.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.495
Okay, but don't look at me.

16:35.578 --> 16:38.039
I have a bashful bladder.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.419
Oh, this is exhilarating!

16:43.503 --> 16:46.422
I tinkle on your fort, Jimmy!

16:46.506 --> 16:48.508
[laughing]

16:49.258 --> 16:51.511
Whose grave we desecrating?

16:58.392 --> 16:59.977
My God, Bob, what are you doing?

17:00.061 --> 17:03.189
I'm making my feelings go away!

17:03.272 --> 17:06.483
That's not the stales, you maniac!
You're eating my inventory!

17:06.567 --> 17:08.944
I have to pay Smokey for
all those freshies!

17:09.028 --> 17:10.320
Too bad, traitor!

17:10.404 --> 17:15.867
You fuck me, then I'm gonna fuck you...
with my mouth!

17:18.454 --> 17:20.455
You know what I mean!

17:21.123 --> 17:23.626
Now I'm the one holding the key, Frank!

17:23.709 --> 17:26.671
God damn it! Open this door! I
got to get home to my daughter!

17:26.753 --> 17:28.631
Fuck your daughter!

17:28.714 --> 17:29.924
You know what I mean!

17:30.007 --> 17:32.134
[phone rings]

17:32.218 --> 17:34.303
Murphy residence. This is Maureen.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.138
- I'm nine.
- Put your father on the phone.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.265
I'm sorry.

17:37.348 --> 17:40.434
My father can't come to the phone
right now. He's in the shower.

17:40.518 --> 17:41.852
Maureen, it's Mommy.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.854
Where the hell is Daddy?!

17:43.938 --> 17:45.773
He didn't come home by noon?

17:45.856 --> 17:50.194
No! I'm all alone here! And he's
supposed to take me to Honeybee Scouts

17:50.278 --> 17:53.155
and I called your office and a
mean man named Gene answered

17:53.239 --> 17:55.825
and he said he'd like
to talk to my mother.

17:55.908 --> 17:56.951
What does that mean?

17:57.034 --> 17:59.161
Honey, I'm sorry your dad's not there.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.455
I'd like to know where
he is right now too.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.624
Can you take me to Honeybee Scouts?

18:03.708 --> 18:07.003
No, sweetie, I can't. Can you walk over?

18:07.086 --> 18:09.171
I have a giant poster!

18:09.255 --> 18:11.215
Honey, I'm so sorry.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.967
Daddy and I will make it up to you.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.302
<i>Fine!</i>

18:14.385 --> 18:17.179
I hate this family!

18:19.098 --> 18:21.559
Jesus, Frank. Where are you?

18:21.642 --> 18:23.185
[woman] Excuse me, hon.

18:23.269 --> 18:27.565
This gentleman would like to call
his wife while I service him.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.526
Stupid parents.

18:30.610 --> 18:34.572
Hello, Maureen! Are you
being publicly shamed?

18:34.655 --> 18:36.324
Every day of my life.

18:36.407 --> 18:39.910
My dad said he'd take me to
Honeybees, but he didn't show up.

18:39.994 --> 18:42.872
Well, I can give you a ride
to your youth meeting.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.333
I'm not supposed to take
rides from strangers.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.084
I'm not a stranger.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.837
I've known you since
the day you were born.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.298
I took your mother to the hospital.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.133
So, my dad missed that too?

18:54.967 --> 18:57.261
I'm always happy to help!

18:59.388 --> 19:02.433
- [Holtenwasser] Where are we going?
- [Maureen] It's on Eisenhower Street.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.894
[Holtenwasser] Ah! Eisenhower.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.480
If I had a Jesus, it would be him.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.650
God damn it, Pogo! Open this door!

19:10.733 --> 19:13.110
- Say you'll help me with Scoop!
- No!

19:13.194 --> 19:15.404
Then fuck you forever!

19:21.702 --> 19:24.246
I'm taking you down with me!

19:24.330 --> 19:27.291
I should've driven over you
when I had the chance.

19:28.751 --> 19:33.881
You un-loyal, ungrateful,
fucking miserable piece of...

19:35.591 --> 19:36.842
Buddy!

19:37.593 --> 19:38.594
[groans]

19:41.722 --> 19:43.933
[breathing heavily]

19:45.810 --> 19:47.103
Dolores?

19:47.186 --> 19:51.315
A Puerto Rican kidnapped me
and forced me to eat candy.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.859
Yes, again.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.738
And...

19:57.822 --> 19:59.115
it's two o'clock.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.285
Hi there, Mr. Merlin's Monocle.

20:04.078 --> 20:05.955
Right on time. I like that.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.540
[chuckles]

20:07.623 --> 20:09.625
Ready for your haircut?

20:09.709 --> 20:12.002
[giggling]

20:12.086 --> 20:13.295
Yeah.

20:22.430 --> 20:25.433
I've never seen anything so beautiful.

20:26.434 --> 20:27.977
Please don't let me wake up.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.313
Here we go. Time for your haircut.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.691
And then a little "trim."

20:34.316 --> 20:35.317
I get it.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.492
You have beautiful hair.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.995
Thank you. I grew it myself.

20:46.078 --> 20:49.331
Oh, you're all sweaty. I like that.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.961
- [blows]
- [shudders]

20:54.670 --> 20:57.298
[in head] <i>It's happening.
It's really happening.</i>

21:02.845 --> 21:06.182
I am ready to enter your
crystal cave of wonder!

21:06.265 --> 21:07.558
Ravish me, oh, lord!

21:07.641 --> 21:09.560
Pillage my insides!

21:09.643 --> 21:11.979
Yes! Yes!

21:12.605 --> 21:13.898
I love you!

21:14.940 --> 21:17.026
Oh, shit. Oh, man!

21:17.109 --> 21:18.861
- Are you okay?
- What?

21:18.944 --> 21:20.404
Yeah, I didn't do anything!

21:20.488 --> 21:21.489
It's all right.

21:21.572 --> 21:24.408
This thing happens to lots of guys.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.828
Maybe we'll just give it a minute
or two, let you calm down.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.371
- I love you!
- Ow!

21:29.455 --> 21:31.040
Ah! You chipped my tooth!

21:31.123 --> 21:33.459
- What the fuck is wrong with you?!
- Nothing!

21:34.126 --> 21:36.003
My nose is bleeding!

21:36.086 --> 21:38.506
- It's not that bad. Let me get it.
- Agh!

21:38.589 --> 21:39.965
Get out, you fucking freak!

21:42.426 --> 21:44.094
[Kevin] Will you tell
everybody we fucked?

21:44.178 --> 21:45.888
Oh, shit!

21:45.971 --> 21:49.475
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! So stupid!

21:49.558 --> 21:51.602
- You fucking dildo!
- [Bolo] Yo, Murph!

21:51.685 --> 21:53.854
Aw, shit. Hey, guys.

21:53.938 --> 21:57.942
Oh, man, Haircut Girl fucked
the shirt off of you.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.026
What did it feel like?

21:59.109 --> 22:01.487
I mean, I've done it
already, like, you know,

22:01.570 --> 22:03.489
a lot, but just tell me how it felt.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.325
Uh, great. Great. Felt really good.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.662
I got to go. Shit! Shit! Shit!

22:09.745 --> 22:14.333
Yeah, he's got to go because after
you do it, you get really cold.

22:16.961 --> 22:20.172
How can one man eat a
$160 worth of candy?

22:20.256 --> 22:21.924
Thank God I stashed some beer money.

22:22.007 --> 22:25.386
Oh, you fucking motherless whore!

22:28.722 --> 22:32.309
Oh, fucking Kevin! Shit! Shit!

22:32.393 --> 22:33.686
[grunts]

22:34.645 --> 22:36.480
What the fuck?

22:40.859 --> 22:41.777
Jesus, Sue.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.449
Just a quick loan, honey.

22:51.662 --> 22:52.913
[Kevin] Shit!

22:52.997 --> 22:55.082
Shit! Shit! Shit!

22:55.165 --> 22:56.542
Shit!

22:56.625 --> 22:58.711
Yeah, this is getting good.

23:00.921 --> 23:01.755
Damn it!

23:02.631 --> 23:03.799
God damn it!

23:05.467 --> 23:07.761
Ow!

23:07.845 --> 23:10.848
The computers of tomorrow
will be capable of performing

23:10.931 --> 23:13.559
10,000 computations in five minutes.

23:14.685 --> 23:15.519
[yawns]

23:16.395 --> 23:20.274
That's like fitting half a book
in a box the size of this room!

23:20.357 --> 23:21.650
Excuse me, Maureen.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.278
This was supposed to be
for the history badge.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.947
All you're doing is
talking about the future.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.282
You're so weird!

23:28.365 --> 23:33.287
<i>♪ Maureen is boring And
we're all snoring! ♪</i>

23:33.370 --> 23:35.789
[girls giggle]

23:35.873 --> 23:37.666
[troop leader] All right, girls.
That's enough.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.214
Okay, you want to hear
some real history?

23:44.298 --> 23:46.675
Mr. Holtenwasser can tell you a story.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.302
I was wondering why he's here.

23:48.385 --> 23:51.639
Mr. Holtenwasser, tell them the
story you told me in the car.

23:51.722 --> 23:54.266
I'd be delighted. [chuckles]

23:54.350 --> 23:56.727
Ah, let me think, where to begin?
Where...

23:56.810 --> 23:58.020
Ah, yes!

23:58.103 --> 24:00.689
You girls like to play games.

24:00.773 --> 24:05.986
How many of you have ever had to lie
in a latrine, pretending to be dead?

24:10.532 --> 24:11.533
God damn it!

24:12.368 --> 24:13.535
You blew it!

24:13.619 --> 24:14.995
We rehearsed!

24:15.079 --> 24:17.790
- Dozens of times!
- What are you doing?

24:17.873 --> 24:20.376
Ah! Jesus, you scared me!

24:20.459 --> 24:22.753
You're the one talking to your pants.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.047
I'm locked out.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.424
I think I lost my key when
I threw it at a bird.

24:27.508 --> 24:28.509
Agh.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.011
Well, I guess I should
help you not freeze.

24:31.095 --> 24:34.014
Vic's got some Emu
sweaters you can borrow.

24:34.098 --> 24:34.932
Thanks.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.727
Did you drop a glazed
doughnut on your lap?

24:39.770 --> 24:42.398
- And so in 1952,
- [crying]

24:42.481 --> 24:48.821
my wife and I moved to a little
town called Liberty... Mississippi.

24:49.345 --> 24:52.306
We left because our front
yard kept catching fire.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.743
[crying]

24:56.704 --> 25:00.082
Thanks. Pretty great you get to
hang out at Vic's house all day.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.918
Yeah. All by myself with nothing to do.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.378
Sounds so cool.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.465
Ooh. It's freezing out.

25:08.549 --> 25:13.130
Yeah. It's cold and... hard.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.765
There it is again.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.726
Stupid thing won't go away.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.653
Hello? Maureen?

25:29.737 --> 25:30.571
Frank?

25:30.654 --> 25:32.448
Anybody?

25:32.531 --> 25:33.949
What happened here?

25:38.537 --> 25:40.039
What the hell?

25:42.374 --> 25:43.417
What the hell?

25:44.918 --> 25:48.005
Frank Fucking Murphy!

25:48.922 --> 25:51.300
[imitating] "I'll be home by noon!
I'll be home by noon!"

25:51.383 --> 25:53.093
Where the fuck are you now?!
[phone rings]

25:53.177 --> 25:54.428
What?!

25:54.511 --> 25:57.973
What's the holdup, Sue? I got to
get that money to Nikos tonight.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.601
Vivian, listen. The thing is...

26:00.684 --> 26:02.770
<i>Will you get me the 150 or not?</i>

26:09.026 --> 26:12.154
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have it.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.744
It's a really gorgeous piece.
One of a kind.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.913
- You sure you want to sell it?
- No.

26:21.830 --> 26:25.918
But I have to. I need this money badly.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.586
I might regret it later,

26:27.669 --> 26:30.631
but right now it's the only thing
that can make this shitty day

26:30.714 --> 26:32.007
feel even remotely bearable.

26:34.551 --> 26:35.511
[man] I understand.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.476
Enjoy your heroin.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.313
