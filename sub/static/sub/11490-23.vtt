13:47.011 --> 13:50.947
Well, obviously, not the same problem.
Jake's head is usually over here.

13:52.250 --> 13:55.447
Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining,
but it can be exhausting.

13:55.620 --> 13:58.613
I can imagine.
Have you given Charlie enough attaboys?

13:59.058 --> 14:01.526
- Attaboys?
- You know, like when you're training a dog.

14:01.694 --> 14:05.825
If you don't give them hugs and a treat,
they're gonna chew up your rug.

14:05.999 --> 14:08.126
I mean, not your rug.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.630
Hey, how are those bananas coming?

14:12.105 --> 14:14.939
- Morning.
- Morning. How'd you sleep?

14:15.109 --> 14:16.440
Good.

14:16.611 --> 14:17.703
When you finally let me.

14:17.879 --> 14:19.642
Hush.

14:20.616 --> 14:21.674
Alan's making pancakes.

14:21.850 --> 14:25.013
- Can I pour you some coffee?
- I would love that.

14:25.587 --> 14:27.715
Good morning, Mrs. Butterworth.

[CHUCKLES]

14:31.094 --> 14:33.460
Oh. Lakers-Spurs today.

14:33.630 --> 14:35.690
You promised we'd go
to the van Gogh exhibit.

14:35.966 --> 14:37.957
- I did?
- Yes.

14:38.269 --> 14:39.861
Wow, I don't remember that.

14:40.037 --> 14:42.302
You gotta quit hitting me
on the head so much.

14:43.141 --> 14:46.804
I've heard that exhibit is supposed
to be terrific. I've been dying to see it.

14:47.212 --> 14:49.579
Really? Then why don't we all go.

14:49.749 --> 14:51.876
ALAN: I can't.
I promised Jake we'd do something.

14:52.185 --> 14:53.243
Bring him along.

14:53.419 --> 14:56.821
What 14-year-old boy
doesn't love a fine-art museum?

14:57.558 --> 14:59.924
That's a great idea,
you and Jake come with us.

15:00.094 --> 15:02.996
- Well, if you don't think we'd be intruding.
- No, not at all.

15:03.164 --> 15:04.927
Okay, great. Heh-heh-heh.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.326
Save me some pancakes.

15:06.501 --> 15:08.162
I'm gonna shower and get ready.

15:08.336 --> 15:11.534
Hurry. I wanna get to the museum
before it's too crowded.

15:11.707 --> 15:13.436
Now, here's the deal.

15:14.810 --> 15:16.676
You're gonna go to the museum
without me.

15:16.847 --> 15:19.975
- Why?
- I am about to get an acute case...

15:20.150 --> 15:21.378
...of intestinal distress.

15:21.551 --> 15:24.749
- What?
- You know, the flapjack two-step.

15:25.656 --> 15:29.649
- There's nothing wrong with my pancakes.
- No, they're delightful.

15:29.827 --> 15:32.388
But Lakers are playing the Spurs,
I'm not gonna miss it.

15:32.564 --> 15:35.362
So what, so you're gonna use me
to entertain your fiancée...

15:35.534 --> 15:37.867
...while you stay home
and watch a basketball game?

15:38.037 --> 15:39.504
Good, we're on the same page.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.368
Did you ever stop to think
maybe I've got plans of my own?

15:42.542 --> 15:45.478
That I've got a life,
that I'm not always at your beck and call.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.608
No.

[GAME PLAYING O VER TV]

15:57.793 --> 16:02.026
You know, Berta, I thought when Alan
moved in here, I was being punished.

16:02.198 --> 16:04.291
You and me both.

16:05.535 --> 16:08.562
But come to find out, it was a blessing.

16:08.739 --> 16:12.641
With him in my life, I think I can actually
make my relationship with Chelsea work.

16:13.511 --> 16:15.604
So you're gonna go through
with this marriage?

16:15.780 --> 16:18.305
Absolutely.
I'm ready for the whole shebang.

16:18.483 --> 16:19.951
Kids too?

16:20.553 --> 16:22.783
Well, it's certainly in the cards.

16:22.955 --> 16:26.254
Of course, I'd have to talk it over
with Chelsea and Alan first.

16:28.662 --> 16:31.927
Wow, marriage and kids.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

16:32.799 --> 16:34.392

- Hang on.

17:13.412 --> 17:16.576
"Don't let him chew up the rug."

17:18.218 --> 17:20.083
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

17:20.887 --> 17:23.220
Why would I chew up a rug?

Not a rug, my... Never mind.

if Chelsea finds me witty and urbane.

Keep it up and she's gonna find you
bloody and homeless.

You don't scare me, Charlie.
