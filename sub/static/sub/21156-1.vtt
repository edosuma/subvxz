[woman] <i>I used to believe that people</i>
<i>determined their own lives.</i>

00:38.203 --> 00:41.915
<i>We were in control,
commanding our futures,</i>

00:42.458 --> 00:46.337
<i>choosing our spouses,
picking professions,</i>

00:46.420 --> 00:50.758
<i>responsible for the decisions
that shape the course of our lives.</i>

00:50.841 --> 00:54.845
<i>And yet, there is one force
more powerful than free will.</i>

00:57.956 --> 00:59.458
<i>Our unconscious.</i>

01:10.569 --> 01:13.494
<i>Underneath the suits,
behind closed doors,</i>

01:13.506 --> 01:16.033
<i>we're all ruled by the same desires.</i>

01:16.742 --> 01:22.289
<i>And those desires can be raw
and dark and deeply shameful.</i>

01:25.668 --> 01:29.296
<i>The more you watch someone,
the more you realize,</i>

01:29.380 --> 01:31.799
<i>we are never really who we say we are.</i>

01:32.299 --> 01:36.929
<i>In fact, hidden underneath,
there's always a secret.</i>

01:37.888 --> 01:42.810
<i>We might actually be someone else.</i>

02:10.963 --> 02:14.008
- [man] We decaf the assholes.
- [man 2] What does that mean?

02:14.425 --> 02:16.093
[man] If the customer's being a dick,

02:16.176 --> 02:18.804
then we give 'em decaf beans
instead of caff.

02:18.887 --> 02:20.931
[man 2] And how do you
determine who's a dick?

02:21.765 --> 02:23.475
[man] Sometimes it's obvious.

02:24.143 --> 02:28.439
- Hey, what can I get for you?
- Um, Americano, thanks.

02:28.522 --> 02:31.484
- Name for the order?
- Diane.

02:31.567 --> 02:33.277
[man] A $1,000 designer suit.

02:34.528 --> 02:36.614
They're like regulars who never tip.

02:37.531 --> 02:39.742
They pretend they tip, you know?

02:39.825 --> 02:42.745
Letting their hand linger over
the tip jar, but nothing ever goes in.

02:42.828 --> 02:44.079
[man 2] Coming right up...

02:44.163 --> 02:46.332
[man] It's like they
think we're oblivious.

02:46.999 --> 02:49.251
Hey, how's your morning going?

02:49.335 --> 02:50.336
Good, thanks.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.588
- Americano.
- Okay.

02:52.671 --> 02:54.590
[cash register opens]

03:00.471 --> 03:04.308
[cell phone ringing]

03:24.620 --> 03:27.206
[woman] I know it was
a very traumatic breakup for her,

03:27.289 --> 03:28.666
but I'm nervous.

03:28.749 --> 03:32.086
I read that women over 35

03:32.169 --> 03:36.966
are 53% more likely to end up alone.

03:37.049 --> 03:39.844
- I read that in the <i>Sunday Times.</i>
- Hmm.

03:39.927 --> 03:41.178
Have you heard about that?

03:41.512 --> 03:44.974
Claire, you can't blame yourself
for your daughter's breakup.

03:45.516 --> 03:49.645
Rebecca's relationship
is her responsibility, her choice.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.232
I thought of signing
her up with OkCupid.

03:53.315 --> 03:54.400
[chuckles]

03:54.483 --> 03:55.901
Isn't that what they call it?

03:56.485 --> 03:58.320
But it's not your decision.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.488
For all you know,

03:59.571 --> 04:03.492
Rebecca might already be
on OkCupid or dating.

04:05.494 --> 04:09.873
See, if you keep trying to control her,
she's gonna keep pushing you away.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.543
You know what I'm gonna say.

04:12.626 --> 04:14.128
Yeah, I know, boundaries.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.130
I know, I know.

04:16.714 --> 04:20.216
But, you know, I'm worried.
I can't help it.

04:20.341 --> 04:23.679
She works all the time,
and she does not date.

04:24.221 --> 04:27.850
And soon she's gonna be old,
and then what's gonna happen to her?

04:27.933 --> 04:30.644
Our goal in this room
is to focus on you.

04:30.728 --> 04:33.272
And for now,
you just need to carve out some time

04:33.355 --> 04:36.442
and figure out what it is
that you need to be happy.

04:37.985 --> 04:39.278
Diane? Who's Diane?

04:39.528 --> 04:40.487
What?

04:41.363 --> 04:42.239
Oh.

04:44.199 --> 04:46.076
Must have picked up someone else's.

04:49.413 --> 04:52.333
Jean, can I ask you
something, friend to friend?

04:53.667 --> 04:56.795
I'm not your friend.
I'm your therapist, Claire.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.882
Well, just about this, I mean, you are.

05:01.342 --> 05:06.347
I just want you to know
that I really like to please you.

05:08.265 --> 05:10.976
But I have a hard time letting go.

05:12.519 --> 05:14.271
I cannot let go.

05:15.439 --> 05:17.107
It's a process.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.383
[pills rattling]

06:09.952 --> 06:12.121
[door opens]

06:12.788 --> 06:14.790
[Jean] Hey, Sam. Come on in.

06:27.511 --> 06:29.054
[Sam] It's not just that.

06:30.389 --> 06:34.018
I don't know, I keep hearing
her voice in my head.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.521
I wish it would stop, but, um...

06:38.772 --> 06:40.858
Sam, it's okay to be emotional.

06:40.941 --> 06:43.819
It's been eight months.
You must think I'm such a loser.

06:43.902 --> 06:47.197
I don't judge, and who cares
what I think, anyway?

06:48.824 --> 06:50.743
She made things exciting.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.913
Whatever you were doing,
she made you feel like

06:54.997 --> 06:57.207
you're part of the best
thing in the world.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.168
It could be buying groceries.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.253
It didn't matter.

07:05.007 --> 07:10.012
I never was adventurous,
but she made me feel like I was.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.267
[sighing]

07:15.726 --> 07:21.565
And now, it's like this
thing was taken from me,

07:22.274 --> 07:24.234
and I feel worthless.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.948
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

07:30.532 --> 07:32.242
You just need to give it some time.

07:33.661 --> 07:37.331
You guys were in a very serious,
co-dependent relationship.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.417
And it makes sense now
that you feel like...

07:41.210 --> 07:42.377
you can't survive without her.

07:45.297 --> 07:48.592
Maybe it'll help if you go
home, pack up her stuff

07:48.676 --> 07:50.719
and just put it in a box.

07:51.595 --> 07:52.846
As long as I have this,

07:52.930 --> 07:55.057
it's fucking impossible
to keep her out of my mind.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.896
I see it, and I just remember how
she convinced me of all people to get it

08:00.980 --> 08:03.565
when I've always been completely opposed
to tattoos.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.443
How did she convince you?

08:07.152 --> 08:08.445
It's like...

08:09.530 --> 08:12.032
we're all searching
for a larger meaning.

08:12.866 --> 08:14.493
And Sidney was it for me.

08:16.328 --> 08:18.288
Maybe I've always been
searching for a reason

08:18.372 --> 08:20.749
with all the crazy shit
going on in the world.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.087
She was persuasive.

08:27.339 --> 08:30.259
It's like staring at the sun.

08:31.343 --> 08:32.803
You know you should probably stop,

08:32.885 --> 08:34.972
but it's the most intense
feeling in the whole world

08:35.054 --> 08:36.807
that you can't help but look.

08:39.226 --> 08:41.061
And being the one in her favor...

08:43.022 --> 08:44.481
there's nothing better.

08:49.194 --> 08:50.946
So he planned the proposal,

08:51.030 --> 08:54.450
but is anxious because
he's still cheating with his co-worker.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.224
[Sasha] How long has
that been going on?

08:56.236 --> 08:56.869
About a year.

08:56.952 --> 09:00.706
- He shouldn't marry her.
- Uh, that's not for us to decide.

09:00.789 --> 09:03.459
We're here to address his issues,
not make his decisions.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.579
I'm sorry. I just feel like we've been

09:05.591 --> 09:07.963
hearing about his rampant
cheating stories

09:08.047 --> 09:09.381
for the past year straight.

09:09.965 --> 09:11.717
And now he's getting married.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.053
[man] Well, behavior
change takes a long time.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.764
And he's made growth
in his commitment to his relationship,

09:16.847 --> 09:20.142
so as long as he's showing up
for sessions and putting the work in...

09:20.225 --> 09:22.895
I'm not questioning
that we support our patients,

09:22.978 --> 09:28.359
but if they keep making poor choices,
maybe we need to change tactics.

09:28.692 --> 09:30.736
It's just disheartening that sometimes

09:30.819 --> 09:33.656
all we can do is help them
keep their head above water.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.784
Jean, I understand it
can be frustrating.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.952
We have to trust that
with time comes clarity.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.162
And at the end of the night,

09:40.245 --> 09:41.914
we go home to our lives,
and they lead theirs.

09:50.255 --> 09:52.549
You know, when I used
to think Darryl was cheating on me,

09:52.633 --> 09:55.177
we would have sex, he'd close his eyes,

09:55.260 --> 09:59.223
and I would try and imagine who he
was thinking about the entire time.

09:59.306 --> 10:00.849
How fucked up is that?

10:01.266 --> 10:03.352
And it would turn me on.

10:04.019 --> 10:06.397
- [Jean] You are crazy as hell.
- [laughs]

10:06.480 --> 10:08.899
Are you telling me
you've never thought about cheating?

10:09.233 --> 10:12.194
[Jean] Well, even if I wanted to,
I just don't have time.

10:12.277 --> 10:13.862
Fuck off. Okay, my point is,

10:13.946 --> 10:16.407
even if I was the best
therapist in the world,

10:16.490 --> 10:19.785
there's no way I could cure
anyone's issues with monogamy.

10:19.868 --> 10:22.287
I mean, maybe just get
them to acknowledge it,

10:22.621 --> 10:24.331
which might be even worse.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.959
Ignorance, man, it's underrated.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.671
If I were Hunter, I'd tell that
poor girl to run for the hills,

10:30.754 --> 10:34.717
and I'd tell my patient to find someone
who actually satisfies him.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.511
Yeah, but then Hunter
would get fucking fired,

10:37.594 --> 10:41.724
and he's the only piece of eye candy
in that office, so no, thank you.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.268
But I'm liking this
rebellious spirit, Jeanie.

10:44.351 --> 10:47.354
Means making supervision
that much more tolerable.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.190
Hi, um...

10:51.108 --> 10:53.193
Combo with lamb, please.

10:53.652 --> 10:57.364
I'll take the Greek salad
with dressing on the side, thanks.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.908
Hey, so Friday, I am having people over.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.034
I gotta christen that view.

11:01.618 --> 11:02.619
Yeah.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.914
Friday's tricky for me.
I have dinner with the Faitelsons.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.541
Are you serious?

11:08.417 --> 11:10.544
I thought you were allergic
to the Stepford wives.

11:10.961 --> 11:13.310
I mean, they're not my favorite people,

11:13.322 --> 11:15.924
but they're amusing,
and it's convenient.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.135
You know what? If I was your therapist,

11:18.218 --> 11:20.346
I would tell you,
you need to let go a little.

11:20.804 --> 11:23.098
Can't remember the last
time we did anything real.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.475
- That was all.
- Oh.

11:24.558 --> 11:27.394
- That's, uh, not true. Thank you.
- [man] Thank you.

11:27.477 --> 11:29.771
I do not bullshit you, my friend.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.983
Hey, my next appointment
isn't till four.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.903
I need a Brazilian. Want to head uptown?

11:35.986 --> 11:38.197
Oh, 'cause that's so fun?

11:38.280 --> 11:41.325
I have a two o'clock. I should head
back, especially after this morning.

11:41.408 --> 11:43.910
Where'd that rebellious
spirit go, Jeanie?

11:48.248 --> 11:51.251
- [horn blares]
- [gasps, sighs]

11:57.549 --> 11:59.343
Your office is so corporate.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.971
[Jean] Thank you.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.850
You think you'd want to make it,
like, warm or something.

12:08.268 --> 12:10.270
You said on the phone it was urgent.

12:11.563 --> 12:15.317
My friend Drew said her mom came, and
you're like some miracle worker, so...

12:16.527 --> 12:18.904
[Jean] I'm not a miracle worker.

12:18.988 --> 12:22.366
Therapy's a serious commitment,
and it begins with communication.

12:23.325 --> 12:26.912
So let's start with why you're here.

12:29.539 --> 12:32.000
It's a pretty brutal story.
Are you sure you can handle it?

12:34.378 --> 12:36.547
This is a safe space, Allison.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.596
Well, I got into Fordham, okay?

12:45.472 --> 12:47.141
Studying, like, history.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.396
And I'm talking to this
guy, Allister, from Berlin.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.735
I mean, long story,
but I got into pills.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.280
First just, like, for
work, and whatever,

13:01.363 --> 13:03.574
then it got kind of out of hand.

13:04.658 --> 13:05.826
What kind of pills?

13:05.909 --> 13:09.496
First just, like, Adderall, you know?
Shit to help me concentrate.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.708
And then some other stuff.

13:14.668 --> 13:18.756
Anyway, the point is
that shit's expensive,

13:19.590 --> 13:20.841
like, real pricey.

13:22.926 --> 13:24.720
And my mom works really hard
to make tuition.

13:24.803 --> 13:27.056
She's a receptionist
at this healthcare place,

13:27.139 --> 13:31.935
and I don't qualify for financial aid
'cause my dad has problems with the IRS.

13:33.062 --> 13:37.399
Just another fucked up story
from a dysfunctional girl.

13:38.609 --> 13:44.031
Anyway, so I stole a check
and used it for drugs.

13:45.532 --> 13:46.825
And what happened?

13:49.870 --> 13:51.121
What do you think happened?

13:53.082 --> 13:54.458
I had to drop out.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.671
And now I don't know what to do.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.258
Have you told your mom?

14:05.094 --> 14:07.930
That's the thing, I can't.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.894
[sighs] 'Cause as if this isn't
a fucking nightmare as it is,

14:13.978 --> 14:16.331
my mom just got the
results of a CT scan,

14:16.343 --> 14:18.482
and it turns out she has lung cancer.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.988
So, no, I'm just the
biggest disappointment,

14:24.071 --> 14:25.656
and that's how she'll remember me.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.449
I'm really sorry to hear that.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.909
Why? You just met me.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.167
Can I ask...

14:38.377 --> 14:42.881
what made you keep going with the drugs?

14:48.220 --> 14:50.973
It's the fucking high, man.

14:55.102 --> 14:59.398
It's like without it,
shit's just gray, you know?

15:03.527 --> 15:07.448
It's like you never felt
a single fucking thing

15:07.906 --> 15:11.285
walking around this place
until it goes through your body.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.547
And I would do it all over again,

15:26.425 --> 15:28.344
knowing everything, too.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.809
It was just beyond my control.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.776
You ever felt like that?

16:09.301 --> 16:13.055
- What can I get for you?
- I'll take an Americano, decaf, thanks.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.727
Actually, what kind of wine do you have?

16:19.395 --> 16:20.604
Living on the edge, huh?

16:21.021 --> 16:24.733
Pinotgrigio, chardonnay
or the house red that's pretty shit?

16:24.816 --> 16:28.111
[chuckles] I'll take a chardonnay.
Thanks.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.114
Name for the order?

16:31.281 --> 16:32.282
Diane.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.681
- This isn't...
- It's better, trust me.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.613
You know this band?

17:12.071 --> 17:13.824
Yeah, it's mine.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.992
We play a show every Friday.

17:16.576 --> 17:17.452
Cool.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.630
Have you always been into coffee?

17:28.713 --> 17:29.756
It's a job.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.968
Yeah, makes sense.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.265
You, you must have
some kind of serious job, huh?

17:41.268 --> 17:42.394
I'm a writer.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.065
You don't look like a writer.

17:46.857 --> 17:51.320
Yeah, well, I'm a journalist,
so it can be kind of corporate.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.073
Anything I would have read?

17:54.156 --> 17:55.491
No.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.912
I do mostly freelance,
op-ed pieces, things like that.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.377
What?

18:08.796 --> 18:11.548
It's just, you're not exactly
our typical kind of customer.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.592
It's not a bad thing.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.595
It's actually kind of hot.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.392
I'm Sidney, by the way.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.603
- I'm...
- Diane.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.022
I won't forget this time.

18:52.464 --> 18:55.801
[applause]

18:58.679 --> 19:00.556
- Hi.
- [instructor yells]

19:00.639 --> 19:01.473
Ya!

19:19.283 --> 19:20.826
- [instructor yells]
- Ya!

19:29.626 --> 19:33.129
It's Dylan, Jack and Holden.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.381
Ella's not going?

19:34.465 --> 19:35.716
She doesn't want to camp.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.887
I'm not sure about you sleeping over
with just boys, honey.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.598
Why? They're more fun.

19:43.139 --> 19:46.768
[sighs] I'll call Dylan's mom.
Maybe you can just go for the day.

19:46.852 --> 19:47.978
That's not fair!

19:48.729 --> 19:50.939
I understand
you might feel that way, honey,

19:51.023 --> 19:53.150
but I just don't think it's a good idea.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.986
- How was school?
- Boring.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.496
[Jean] Homework, shower, PJs.

20:06.789 --> 20:07.706
Hear me?

20:10.459 --> 20:13.128
- Can I get a yes?
- Yes.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.716
Ow, shit.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.719
- [man] Hey.
- Hey, honey.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.514
Hi, Harold, hey, how are you?

20:23.597 --> 20:25.474
I hear we're cooking tonight?

20:25.557 --> 20:28.310
Don't get too excited.
I just put a pizza in the oven.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.257
Aw, Lex said you were making something.

20:30.269 --> 20:31.563
Oh, is that what Lex said?

20:31.647 --> 20:33.107
Yes, it is.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.861
Well, I was gonna do a whole shop,
but I figured I'd go with the car.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.071
Doll upstairs?

20:39.154 --> 20:41.323
[Jean]
Yeah, and I spoke with Miss Finnegan,

20:41.407 --> 20:43.283
and even with the extra time,

20:43.367 --> 20:44.868
her scores still haven't improved.

20:45.451 --> 20:47.579
She's got her whole life
to worry about grades.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.082
Yeah, I just want to rule out ADHD.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.750
We're not giving her Ritalin.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.169
I didn't say anything about drugs.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.130
If we take her to somebody,
they're going to prescribe it.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.923
You know that, right? You know that.

20:58.007 --> 20:58.841
[Dolly] Daddy!

20:59.008 --> 21:00.968
Is that my little ninja?

21:01.051 --> 21:02.052
Ha!

21:02.136 --> 21:03.846
[laughs] How was school?

21:03.928 --> 21:05.889
How are you? Throw the football?

21:05.973 --> 21:08.475
- [Dolly] We are.
- All right, come on.

21:08.558 --> 21:11.269
[laughing]

21:11.352 --> 21:15.064
[timer ticking]

21:21.279 --> 21:22.530
This pizza's sexy.

21:23.531 --> 21:26.326
[laughs]

21:26.410 --> 21:27.953
Do you know what that means, honey?

21:28.536 --> 21:30.788
Yes, uh, cool.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.875
Like <i>Star Wars. Star Wars</i> is so sexy.

21:33.958 --> 21:35.084
Mm.

21:35.668 --> 21:39.172
Well, actually it's a... adult word

21:39.256 --> 21:42.676
that we use to describe
a person who's...

21:43.886 --> 21:44.887
pretty.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.432
Are you sexy, Daddy?

21:48.515 --> 21:51.101
Uh, well, I'm mediocre.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.854
But do you know who's really sexy?

21:53.937 --> 21:55.356
- Who?
- Your mom.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.108
Does that make me sexy?

21:58.191 --> 22:01.319
Um, one day you will be, honey, yeah.

22:01.403 --> 22:05.407
But not for a very,
very, very long time.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.329
[laughs]

22:11.079 --> 22:13.748
Hey, honey,
did you make a decision about the hotel?

22:13.831 --> 22:16.000
- We need to book it.
- Alexis is looking into it.

22:16.919 --> 22:19.922
Oh, I'm surprised she's not joining us.

22:21.674 --> 22:25.719
What do you tell women
who come to you with jealousy issues?

22:25.803 --> 22:29.181
I just know her type,
young and eager to please.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.142
Well, in that case, sounds great.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.019
I'm gonna text her right now.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.437
Shut up.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.648
- Daddy?
- Mm-hmm?

22:37.731 --> 22:39.066
Can I watch a show on the iPad?

22:39.149 --> 22:40.651
No, you may not, it's time for bed.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.569
- Please, just one show.
- No.

22:42.653 --> 22:44.613
Dolly, upstairs, please.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.116
[mocking] Upstairs, please.
You gotta go to bed.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.200
I'll clean up.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.744
You go deal with Little Miss Sexy.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.457
- Delicious meal.
- Hm.

23:00.546 --> 23:04.258
It's just crazy to think someone can
have that kind of power over your life.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.637
You're not getting emotionally
involved again, are you?

23:08.721 --> 23:10.639
No, of course not.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.977
Just reminds me of that
time before Dolly,

23:15.853 --> 23:19.857
when I was losing my mind,
breaking up with you every other day.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.317
You were fine.

23:22.693 --> 23:24.236
No, you were fine.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.990
You threw yourself into work.
I think that's how you made partner.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.533
I don't know if that's a good thing.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.122
Just miss that feeling sometimes.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.041
Oh, my God, are you fucking kidding me?

23:37.124 --> 23:39.001
I don't. It was a roller
coaster every day.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.754
I know, but...

23:47.092 --> 23:48.260
You know, um...

23:49.010 --> 23:52.597
Actually, Larin invited me

23:52.680 --> 23:55.975
to a thing on Friday night.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.689
We have a dinner at the Faitelson's.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.774
I know, I just...

24:03.859 --> 24:06.528
I just feel like I haven't done
anything fun in a while.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.323
Ooh, I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.325
You know what I mean.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.327
[iPad chimes]

24:16.246 --> 24:17.623
[groans]

24:19.792 --> 24:21.543
[both sighing]

24:21.627 --> 24:22.878
That's just...

24:22.960 --> 24:26.964
Shouldn't Alexis be out on a date
as opposed to e-mailing you right now?

24:29.218 --> 24:30.219
Hey.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.433
She's not my type, for the record.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.018
Good.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.605
'Cause you are definitely my type.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.107
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.525
What are you gonna do about it?

24:45.317 --> 24:46.652
Watch out.

24:54.368 --> 24:57.621
[moaning]

24:59.373 --> 25:02.251
[breathing heavily]

25:03.544 --> 25:04.962
[moaning]

25:06.964 --> 25:09.550
[breathing heavily]

25:11.468 --> 25:14.722
[gasping]

26:43.268 --> 26:45.854
[chattering]

26:47.439 --> 26:48.399
Hey.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.150
- Good?
- Yeah.

26:50.985 --> 26:52.152
Oh.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.488
Bye, sweetie.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.354
[Dolly] Hey, want to
go play <i>Fruit Ninja?</i>

26:58.366 --> 26:59.408
[school bell rings]

27:10.921 --> 27:12.464
[sighs]

27:44.955 --> 27:46.832
[hanger rattles]

28:33.878 --> 28:35.880
[cell phone ringing]

28:39.467 --> 28:41.469
[ringing stops]

28:49.728 --> 28:52.773
Oh, hi, I was wondering,
do you have Chance by Chanel?

28:52.856 --> 28:55.693
Yes. We also carry
Chanel No.5, or our new...

28:55.776 --> 28:57.861
Just that one, thanks.

29:14.627 --> 29:17.171
[cell phone rings]

29:17.256 --> 29:19.717
Hey, honey, I just bought
you the cutest little...

29:19.800 --> 29:21.051
<i>It's Alexis.</i>

29:21.135 --> 29:25.556
Oh, sorry, Alexis.
I was just shopping for ties.

29:25.639 --> 29:27.266
<i>Yeah, Dolly's school called.</i>

29:27.349 --> 29:29.893
- Is everything all right?
- <i>Oh, yes, yes, sorry.</i>

29:29.977 --> 29:32.521
You should start with that, okay?

29:32.604 --> 29:34.023
<i>They need you to go down there.</i>

29:34.106 --> 29:37.151
<i>It's nothing serious, but something
happened with a girl in her class.</i>

29:37.234 --> 29:39.653
[groans] Is Michael there?
Can I talk to him?

29:39.737 --> 29:41.363
<i>He just stepped into a meeting.</i>

29:41.447 --> 29:43.741
<i>They tried calling you,
but said your phone was off.</i>

29:43.824 --> 29:45.326
Yeah, I was just...

29:45.409 --> 29:47.077
Okay, I'm on my way.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.750
Of course we want her
to express herself,

29:50.762 --> 29:52.750
but we can't have this in a classroom.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.294
Can I ask if Dolly kissed a boy,

29:55.377 --> 29:57.129
would that be grounds
for this conversation?

29:57.212 --> 29:58.422
Sorry, I have to ask.

29:58.505 --> 30:01.925
Jean, we teach this
to be a safe space for our children,

30:02.007 --> 30:05.553
which means no hitting, no touching,
and that includes affection.

30:05.636 --> 30:09.265
I mean, gender has little to do with it,
or rather, nothing to do with it.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.810
Right, I get it, but they're kids.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.105
I mean, it doesn't really mean anything.

30:15.189 --> 30:16.607
It wasn't just the kiss.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.193
She also told Sadie
she wasn't really a girl,

30:19.777 --> 30:22.321
and when Sadie said she
was, she kept insisting.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.283
Yeah, Michael and I are dealing with it.

30:26.367 --> 30:28.118
Not like when we were young, huh?

30:28.577 --> 30:30.454
This sexuality stuff starts early.

30:33.622 --> 30:38.294
He was basically implying
that she's either trans or a lesbian.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.507
Okay, well, so what?
How is that even relevant?

30:41.590 --> 30:44.760
Right, it's not like we're gonna
send her to conversion therapy.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.178
- [cell phone chimes]
- Hold on.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.888
- [Michael] Who's texting?
- Larin.

30:49.974 --> 30:52.476
[sighs] It's just about
the thing tonight.

30:54.103 --> 30:55.562
[Michael sighs] Oh, my God.

30:55.646 --> 30:58.732
- God, I'm so not in the mood for this.
- You were the one that suggested it.

30:58.816 --> 31:00.484
I thought it was a
good idea at the time.

31:00.567 --> 31:01.819
[doorbell rings]

31:04.113 --> 31:04.947
[Jean sighs]

31:05.030 --> 31:06.824
- You okay? You seem a little nervous.
- I'm fine.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.534
- [woman] Jean!
- Hey, Holly!

31:08.617 --> 31:09.785
[Holly] Michael.

31:12.745 --> 31:15.498
Well, apparently they're
getting divorced.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.127
Colin was always such
a flirt, very touchy,

31:18.210 --> 31:20.379
always telling me
how fit I looked, remember?

31:20.462 --> 31:21.630
Was he having an affair?

31:21.714 --> 31:23.799
- I'm convinced it was their nanny.
- [Holly scoffs]

31:23.882 --> 31:27.094
And they have that Australian au pair
who lives with them, I mean, come on.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.512
Do you know if it's true?

31:28.595 --> 31:30.556
- It's just my personal theory.
- Oh.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.641
You guys have way too
much time on your hands.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.685
You're lucky.
You get the benefit of the gossip

31:34.768 --> 31:36.603
without having to show up
to every school event.

31:36.685 --> 31:37.811
Touché.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.691
[woman] Oh, by the way,
Eleanor signed up to bring brownies

31:40.774 --> 31:42.067
to the bake sale this year.

31:42.151 --> 31:44.111
Oh, but I always do the brownies.

31:44.194 --> 31:46.488
Sorry, she called it.
Oh, we do need a pie, though.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.575
No, can't we just do two sets
of brownies? I mean, it's...

31:49.658 --> 31:52.828
Oh, remember Maggie's mother
bought that cherry pie last year

31:52.911 --> 31:53.912
from Stop and Shop?

31:53.996 --> 31:56.373
Oh! I mean, I know she works, but...

31:56.457 --> 31:58.083
[woman] She is a single mother.

31:58.167 --> 32:01.462
I can give you this beautiful recipe
for a pear cardamom pie.

32:02.046 --> 32:04.214
- That sounds complicated.
- Oh, it's simple.

32:04.298 --> 32:05.883
[woman] Apple or pumpkin would be fine.

32:05.966 --> 32:08.469
Apple's boring. Maybe pecan?

32:08.552 --> 32:11.263
[woman] No, with the kids' nuts
allergies, we could stay away from that.

32:11.347 --> 32:13.140
Oh, does it really fucking matter?

32:13.223 --> 32:15.434
I mean, it's an elementary
school bake sale.

32:15.516 --> 32:18.227
They won't know the difference.
Can you do this, please? I can't.

32:21.355 --> 32:22.356
You okay?

32:22.900 --> 32:24.943
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just tired.

32:25.526 --> 32:27.486
And I'm not in the mood to bake a pie.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.158
[dinner guests laughing]

32:31.867 --> 32:33.786
Well, I'll get some more.

32:34.328 --> 32:36.455
Actually, do you guys have any bourbon?

32:37.039 --> 32:38.916
[man]
Since when are you into bourbon, Jeanie?

32:38.999 --> 32:40.834
I don't know, just feel like a change.

32:40.916 --> 32:42.751
[laughs] Oh, adventurous.

32:42.835 --> 32:45.296
I've got some Bulleit, Woodford Reserve.

32:45.381 --> 32:46.382
Do you drink it straight?

32:47.007 --> 32:48.717
- On the rocks.
- Ah.

33:05.109 --> 33:08.362
[guests laughing]

33:17.621 --> 33:19.498
On a scale of one to ten,
how bad was that?

33:19.581 --> 33:22.459
I don't know
why we need that info on those hotels.

33:22.543 --> 33:24.336
You are far too accommodating.

33:24.420 --> 33:27.631
I'm strategic. Sometimes it's
easier just to appease someone.

33:27.713 --> 33:30.924
Well, that soufflé was to die for.
Definitely a ten.

33:31.008 --> 33:33.135
Mm, it was. I should have married her.

33:33.220 --> 33:35.639
[laughs] Go for it.
I'd love to see that.

33:35.973 --> 33:38.475
I'd rather eat frozen pizza
the rest of my life.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.853
You know, I think I can still make it.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.734
- Where?
- To Larin's, remember?

33:46.817 --> 33:48.944
She's having a thing
at her new apartment.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.779
You want to go now?

33:51.947 --> 33:54.867
Yeah.
She'll be so shocked if I just show up.

33:56.035 --> 33:58.454
- But you're drunk, honey.
- No, I'm not.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.165
You don't think I know
when you're drunk?

34:01.246 --> 34:04.500
You say it like I'm breaking the law.
I'm of age, you know?

34:06.086 --> 34:09.297
You really want me to take you to the
train station right now, like this?

34:09.882 --> 34:10.966
Like what?

34:12.259 --> 34:15.721

[chattering]

35:36.135 --> 35:37.928
Hi, excuse me.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.389
Can I get an old-fashioned?

35:40.472 --> 35:43.267
- What kind of bourbon?
- Uh, Bulleit?

35:43.934 --> 35:45.644
She just...
she doesn't treat you right.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.686
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's what I'm saying, I swear.

35:47.770 --> 35:50.355
If you objectify them,
you're an asshole.

35:50.441 --> 35:51.942
And then if you don't,

35:52.776 --> 35:53.986
you're still fucked.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.362
Oh!

35:55.446 --> 35:57.323
- Shit!
- Shit, I'm so sorry.

35:57.406 --> 35:58.949
- Damn it.
- Man, you're an idiot.

35:59.033 --> 36:00.409
Let me get you another drink.

36:00.868 --> 36:02.536
- No, it's fine.
- Here, I got you.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.997
I got it. I got it, thank you.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.624
Dude, offer to pay for her dry cleaning.

36:06.707 --> 36:09.877
- Oh, yeah, okay.
- No, don't worry.

36:10.544 --> 36:12.129
It's fine, I'm leaving.

Oh, hi.

38:47.618 --> 38:49.078
You came after all.

were great, all of you.

- Yeah.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.044
This is Frances.

This is Diane.

Hey, nice to meet ya.

Nice to meet you, too. Great job.

39:07.137 --> 39:09.974
All right, ladies,
I'm gonna go find Paige.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.350
Have fun.

39:15.477 --> 39:17.980
- You want?
- I shouldn't.

39:18.649 --> 39:20.109
I won't tell anyone.

39:21.694 --> 39:24.321
[sighs] You are persuasive.

39:26.071 --> 39:26.947
[lighter clicks]

39:30.075 --> 39:31.952
- So, you liked the show?
- Yeah.

39:32.329 --> 39:34.289
You have a real presence. It's rare.

39:36.083 --> 39:37.459
So, is he your boyfriend?

39:38.210 --> 39:39.670
- Frances?
- Hmm.

39:39.753 --> 39:40.587
No.

39:41.171 --> 39:42.715
I don't really do that anymore.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.217
- Do what?
- Relationships.

39:45.301 --> 39:46.969
Well, serious ones.

39:47.050 --> 39:49.845
Wow, you must have really gotten burnt.

39:50.306 --> 39:55.436
No, actually,
I was just in a messy situation.

39:55.936 --> 39:57.563
What was the situation?

39:58.063 --> 39:59.690
It's really not worth going into.

39:59.773 --> 40:04.028
No, I want to know what kind of person
you would be with.

40:05.738 --> 40:09.074
Well, he's the opposite
of anyone I'd choose now.

40:10.242 --> 40:13.287
He was this sweet guy, the sweetest,

40:13.370 --> 40:16.498
but so needy and dependent.

40:17.041 --> 40:18.125
It was sad.

40:18.542 --> 40:22.421
He kept clinging to me
for his, like, sustenance.

40:23.130 --> 40:25.049
I was just so fucking bored.

40:26.008 --> 40:27.134
You know what that feels like,

40:27.215 --> 40:30.510
when you're climbing out of
your skin, completely trapped?

40:32.014 --> 40:34.433
The worst part is,
he'd make me feel guilty.

40:34.892 --> 40:36.435
Tell me how he'd, like,

40:36.518 --> 40:39.229
kill himself if I left,
all this bullshit.

40:40.397 --> 40:42.900
- Was he serious?
- I mean, yeah.

40:43.525 --> 40:45.944
Getting out a knife,
saying he'd slit his wrists.

40:46.820 --> 40:49.657
Like, do you think that makes someone
want to stay with you?

40:50.074 --> 40:51.784
When you have nothing of your own?

40:54.828 --> 40:56.080
Let's get a drink.

40:56.161 --> 40:57.871
- What, now?
- Yeah.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.792
Or are you busy or something?

40:59.875 --> 41:02.002
- Aren't you busy?
- Nope.

41:03.337 --> 41:06.090
Well, don't you have a ton
of people here, friends?

41:06.173 --> 41:07.508
No one I care to hang with.

41:08.467 --> 41:09.802
Unless you're not free.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.222
Fine, one drink.

41:17.476 --> 41:20.562
So, Frances is just a
friend and so is Jack.

41:20.646 --> 41:23.023
Seems you have quite
the adventurous life.

41:23.480 --> 41:25.690
- Are you calling me a slut?
- [laughing]

41:25.776 --> 41:26.944
'Cause I'm not.

41:27.027 --> 41:28.904
I prefer open-minded.

41:30.239 --> 41:32.241
We can't all be so pure like you.

41:32.324 --> 41:34.159
You think I'm so straight-laced.

41:34.576 --> 41:37.621
No, I could shock you, trust me.

41:38.038 --> 41:40.416
[scoffs] That's pretty tough.

41:40.499 --> 41:41.792
[laughs]

41:45.587 --> 41:46.880
My parents are divorced,

41:46.964 --> 41:50.968
so I spent summers road tripping
through Europe with my dad.

41:51.802 --> 41:53.971
They were the highlight of everything.

41:54.388 --> 41:57.599
I'd literally count down the days,
like a naïve idiot,

41:57.683 --> 41:59.018
till he'd come pick me up.

42:00.311 --> 42:03.355
Anyway, this one time,
we were 42 minutes into the drive,

42:03.439 --> 42:05.149
barely left my shitty town,

42:05.858 --> 42:07.484
when the police stopped us.

42:09.278 --> 42:12.781
My dad was a fucking criminal, a liar.

42:13.782 --> 42:15.075
Real disappointment.

42:16.702 --> 42:19.997
So, five years old, holding my
"Beauty and the Beast" comforter,

42:20.080 --> 42:22.583
I was escorted by the
police back to my house.

42:24.835 --> 42:26.003
[sniffles]

42:26.086 --> 42:28.172
I understood then the key to happiness.

42:30.507 --> 42:31.634
And what's that?

42:32.926 --> 42:34.178
Active denial.

42:36.388 --> 42:38.432
I looked at that thing, and...

42:38.849 --> 42:40.684
and I didn't see it as real.

42:41.226 --> 42:45.814
It was this one thing that happened,
and I went about my day,

42:46.273 --> 42:47.941
pretending all was cool.

42:49.443 --> 42:51.028
What happened to your dad?

42:53.030 --> 42:54.490
Supposedly in prison.

42:55.614 --> 42:59.075
I mean, I haven't seen him in ages,
and I don't ever think about him,

43:00.704 --> 43:03.624
which I count to be
my Christmas gift every year.

43:08.379 --> 43:11.507
But what about you?
Tell me what you write about.

43:12.257 --> 43:14.885
Mostly about people.

43:15.427 --> 43:16.595
What about them?

43:17.137 --> 43:18.347
Just...

43:18.430 --> 43:20.557
there's so much we don't understand.

43:21.223 --> 43:24.851
I like to see beneath the surface,
subtext. Like, for example...

43:24.935 --> 43:30.440
How vain it is to sit down and write
when you've not stood up to live.

43:31.819 --> 43:32.820
Thoreau.

43:33.777 --> 43:35.570
- I like it.
- Hmm.

43:36.031 --> 43:40.369
But I feel like I've lived, or used to.

43:40.703 --> 43:42.204
[sighs]

43:42.287 --> 43:44.915
Back in the day I was
a little more wild.

43:44.999 --> 43:46.041
[chuckles]

43:46.583 --> 43:49.253
- But now I...
- Now what?

43:52.589 --> 43:53.674
Nothing.

43:55.551 --> 43:57.052
You never wanted to get married?

43:58.929 --> 44:00.389
I tried it once.

44:01.348 --> 44:03.475
Just feel like we change so much.

44:05.602 --> 44:06.979
How on Earth are you supposed to know

44:07.062 --> 44:09.273
who you'll want to be with ten years
from now?

44:09.690 --> 44:11.108
[Sidney] I couldn't agree more.

44:15.195 --> 44:16.113
[Jean stammers]

44:17.448 --> 44:20.492
- Uh, I, um...
- What is it?

44:20.576 --> 44:22.286
Nothing, I just, uh,

44:22.369 --> 44:24.747
stayed much longer than
I thought I would.

44:24.830 --> 44:26.624
So? What's the rush?

44:27.333 --> 44:28.417
Uh...

44:29.084 --> 44:31.670
Work. Deadlines.

44:31.754 --> 44:33.088
Well, that sucks.

44:33.631 --> 44:35.257
I really like talking to you.

44:43.682 --> 44:48.145
- Who's this?
- Uh, that's my niece, my sister's kid.

44:48.228 --> 44:50.773
- She's adorable.
- Thanks.

44:58.194 --> 45:00.530
- You know, you smell like me.
- What?

45:01.200 --> 45:03.535
Chance, Chanel?

45:05.454 --> 45:07.581
It's just a gift box.

45:09.667 --> 45:11.502
I can't explain it, but...

45:12.252 --> 45:15.422
there's something about you
that reminds me of me.

[elevator bell dings]

47:19.004 --> 47:19.964
Good morning.

47:27.010 --> 47:29.596
- Good morning, Alexis.
- Alan called, he wants to see you.

47:29.682 --> 47:30.683
Did he say why?

47:30.766 --> 47:33.644
No, but word on the street is
his daughter-in-law just gave birth,

47:33.727 --> 47:34.937
and he's taking off to Florida.

47:35.020 --> 47:36.772
[Michael groaning]

47:38.023 --> 47:39.233
[Alexis] How was your weekend?

47:39.692 --> 47:42.069
[Michael] I ate soufflé, drank scotch.

47:42.152 --> 47:44.571
I love soufflé. Thanks for the invite.

47:44.655 --> 47:45.864
Oh, yeah, please.

47:45.948 --> 47:48.492
Jean already thinks I spend
too much time talking to you.

48:04.967 --> 48:09.763
[traffic rumbling]

48:14.682 --> 48:17.519
[chattering]

48:27.987 --> 48:29.352
Can you just give me
five minutes, okay?

48:29.364 --> 48:29.822
No.

48:36.663 --> 48:40.166
[Claire] I haven't seen her in two
months. She barely answers her phone.

48:40.794 --> 48:44.048
So this weekend,
when she canceled, I blew up!

48:45.257 --> 48:47.134
Why do you think she's avoiding me?

48:48.258 --> 48:51.719
It's impossible for me
to speculate on Rebecca's life.

48:51.805 --> 48:53.641
I only have access to you.

48:54.391 --> 48:56.268
[Claire] I think she's just busy.

48:56.852 --> 48:59.647
If she were dating,
that would be a good enough reason.

49:01.148 --> 49:04.735
I used to hope that she wasn't picking
up because she was having sex.

49:04.818 --> 49:06.362
[laughs]

49:06.445 --> 49:08.572
That would be fine by me, you know?

49:09.573 --> 49:13.994
I understand your concern,
but by giving her space,

49:14.078 --> 49:17.289
you might show her
that you're respecting her boundaries.

49:17.373 --> 49:18.666
[Claire] I'm furious...

49:19.458 --> 49:22.002
that she won't give her mother any time.

49:23.003 --> 49:25.798
Her job is more important.
The gym is more important.

49:26.799 --> 49:29.051
Even her weekly blow-out every Monday.

49:29.635 --> 49:31.303
That she has time for.

49:32.802 --> 49:35.513
And I've been to that salon.
It's really not very nice.

49:38.519 --> 49:42.314
Rebecca loves you, Claire.
Just give it some time.

49:43.107 --> 49:47.236
Emotions change like the wind.

49:49.863 --> 49:52.533
[keyboard clacking]

50:01.625 --> 50:02.960
[phone rings]

50:03.043 --> 50:04.628
Michael Holloway's office.

50:04.837 --> 50:06.714
Hi, Alexis, is Michael there?

50:06.797 --> 50:09.633
<i>He's just finishing up a call.
Can I have him return?</i>

50:10.134 --> 50:12.094
Uh, actually, it's kind of important.

50:12.177 --> 50:13.804
I need to talk to him about the hotel.

50:13.887 --> 50:15.931
Yeah, I'm just waiting on the go ahead.

50:16.015 --> 50:18.183
His schedule got a bit turned around
with the Abernathy case.

50:18.264 --> 50:21.059
<i>Oh, can you just put him on?
I really need to speak to him.</i>

50:22.435 --> 50:25.229
[Michael] I understand, I think
if we just concentrate more on...

50:25.607 --> 50:26.859
Jean, Belize.

50:27.526 --> 50:29.945
Um, I'm gonna have to
call you right back, okay?

50:30.029 --> 50:31.655
Sorry, thank you.

50:31.739 --> 50:32.823
Putting you through.

50:34.616 --> 50:35.701
[Michael] Hey, honey.

50:36.618 --> 50:38.078
Fucking watch it!

50:38.162 --> 50:40.122
Oh, whoa, wait a second.

50:40.831 --> 50:44.168
Oh, honey, listen,
I don't want to keep nagging you,

50:44.251 --> 50:46.920
but I really want to know
that you booked the tickets

50:47.004 --> 50:49.965
and the flights before they get crazy.

50:50.633 --> 50:53.886
[sighs] You have no idea
how much I'm looking forward to this.

50:53.969 --> 50:56.096
[Michael on phone]
<i>Honey, we're gonna need to push.</i>

50:56.180 --> 50:57.890
What? Are you serious?

50:57.973 --> 50:59.600
I already took off my days.

50:59.683 --> 51:02.811
Alan is going out of town.
It's just terrible timing.

51:02.895 --> 51:04.396
I'm really, really sorry.

51:04.477 --> 51:07.105
I promise, we will go.

51:07.188 --> 51:09.565
<i>Alexis, can we get Bill
on the line, please?</i>

51:09.652 --> 51:10.861
[Alexis] <i>I'll get him
on the other line now.</i>

51:10.944 --> 51:12.571
[Michael] <i>I'm sorry, honey,
I'm really busy right now.</i>

51:12.655 --> 51:14.114
<i>Can we talk about this when I get home?</i>

51:14.198 --> 51:15.449
No...

51:15.532 --> 51:17.076
I don't want to talk about it.

51:17.159 --> 51:18.911
<i>Come on, honey, don't be mad.</i>

51:19.495 --> 51:21.872
I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed.

51:23.248 --> 51:27.044
Anyway, listen, I'm at my appointment.
I'll see you at home, okay?

51:33.005 --> 51:35.717
[blow dryer whistling]

51:39.556 --> 51:42.476
I thought I was the only one
who did this during lunch hour.

51:44.103 --> 51:46.021
It's like my salvation.

52:06.625 --> 52:07.835
[sighs]

52:13.716 --> 52:15.551
[pills rattle]

52:22.474 --> 52:24.768
[sighs]

52:25.394 --> 52:26.854
[Sam sighs]

52:27.855 --> 52:31.150
I did it. I put her stuff in a box.

52:32.234 --> 52:33.402
Good.

52:33.483 --> 52:37.069
But then I didn't know
if I should ship it.

52:37.156 --> 52:41.702
It seemed so formal or something,
so I decided just bring it to her.

52:41.785 --> 52:44.038
I knew it was her shift today
at the coffee shop.

52:44.621 --> 52:46.040
You okay? You seem okay.

52:46.120 --> 52:47.747
Yeah, it was, it was fine.

52:47.830 --> 52:50.833
We talked for a few minutes, caught up.

52:51.754 --> 52:53.922
She told me a little bit
about her show the other night.

52:54.757 --> 52:56.091
What did she say?

52:56.175 --> 52:59.345
Not much, just how excited she was.

52:59.595 --> 53:01.096
How she wished I could have seen it.

53:01.680 --> 53:03.432
I used to love seeing her perform.

53:03.891 --> 53:07.519
I always felt like,
even if it was a full house,

53:07.603 --> 53:10.356
like... like I was the
only one in the audience.

53:16.070 --> 53:18.447
You know, I was thinking, Sam,

53:18.864 --> 53:22.951
is it possible that you came on
too strong with Sidney?

53:23.035 --> 53:25.496
[stammering] What do you mean? Today?

53:25.576 --> 53:27.370
No, in general.

53:28.499 --> 53:32.002
She just seems so independent
and free-spirited,

53:32.086 --> 53:34.213
from the way you describe her.

53:34.630 --> 53:36.215
Maybe she felt claustrophobic.

53:36.298 --> 53:38.217
I don't understand
why you're telling me this.

53:38.300 --> 53:42.763
You said the other day
you had nothing except Sidney.

53:43.347 --> 53:46.058
It's never a good idea to put
that kind of pressure on someone.

53:48.560 --> 53:50.187
I didn't force her to stay.

53:50.854 --> 53:52.147
We were in love,

53:52.898 --> 53:54.900
and then she got scared.

53:55.693 --> 53:58.278
Decided she needed
to experience more shit.

53:58.988 --> 53:59.989
More people.

54:00.072 --> 54:01.323
So she's dating?

54:01.907 --> 54:05.577
No, she actually told me
she's not interested in any guys.

54:07.663 --> 54:09.623
So she's interested in women?

54:10.541 --> 54:12.418
No. What?

54:12.501 --> 54:14.545
Well, the way you...

54:14.628 --> 54:18.966
Anyway, it's very common
for young women to dally or try things.

54:19.049 --> 54:21.510
Well, she's straight,
if that's what you're asking.

54:21.591 --> 54:24.552
I mean, she never even had
that many close girlfriends.

54:25.180 --> 54:27.766
I mean, I would know, right?

54:27.850 --> 54:29.852
Yeah, I'm sure you would.

54:30.185 --> 54:33.522
Well, anyway, I could
tell she's unhappy.

54:33.897 --> 54:34.898
How?

54:35.691 --> 54:36.984
I just felt it.

54:37.443 --> 54:40.612
It was small things, but I could see it.

54:43.407 --> 54:46.869
Well, sounds like she's finding her way,

54:47.578 --> 54:49.038
figuring out a lot.

54:49.455 --> 54:52.207
I mean, aren't we all figuring it out?

54:53.000 --> 54:54.918
Not to make it about
the past or anything,

54:54.930 --> 54:56.545
but Sid's dad died when she was 11.

54:57.126 --> 54:58.294
Wait, her dad? I thought...

54:58.380 --> 55:00.049
Yeah, she was at camp.

55:00.633 --> 55:02.926
She spent summers in
America, 'cause of her mom,

55:04.011 --> 55:06.847
and one day her mom drives
up there and just tells her.

55:07.681 --> 55:09.683
She didn't even get
to go to the funeral.

55:10.517 --> 55:11.977
Never got closure.

55:12.686 --> 55:15.272
I think that's where
her trust issues come from.

55:16.357 --> 55:18.567
I'm really the only guy
she's ever trusted.

55:19.318 --> 55:21.487
So, yeah, I know her,

55:22.112 --> 55:24.156
probably better than she knows herself.
