00:00.821 --> 00:02.314
[Iron Man] Welcome to Stark Industries,

00:02.339 --> 00:05.719
developer of the most amazing
technology on the planet.

00:06.844 --> 00:10.061
Which is why so many bad guys
are always trying to steal it.

00:10.614 --> 00:13.464
In this case, the tech-pirates
known as SteelCorps.

00:13.489 --> 00:18.050
Normally I'd call for some muscle, but
it's Saturday and Hulk likes to sleep in.

00:18.075 --> 00:21.192
<i>[Friday] Is this really the best
time to be making a corporate video?</i>

00:21.217 --> 00:22.964
Just keep recording, Friday.

00:22.989 --> 00:26.346
There's nothing investors like more
than smacking down the competition.

00:26.877 --> 00:29.003
S.H.I.E.L.D. rockets,
A.I.M. thrusters

00:29.028 --> 00:31.165
and are those Justin Hammer optics?

00:31.190 --> 00:33.863
Doesn't anybody know how
to innovate anymore?

00:34.071 --> 00:39.828
<i>[robot] Innovation, Stark, is simply
using old ideas in new ways.</i>

00:41.829 --> 00:45.445
<i>There is also something to be
said for strength in numbers.</i>

00:46.721 --> 00:48.624
Whoa. Hey! Watch it!

00:48.649 --> 00:51.959
<i>Maybe you should call
your big green friend.</i>

00:53.323 --> 00:55.884
<i>[Friday] Power levels are at 15%.</i>

00:55.909 --> 00:58.677
<i>Which is also your chance
of coming out of this alive.</i>

00:58.702 --> 01:01.112
Friday, call for backup!

01:01.590 --> 01:03.201
<i>Comms just went down.</i>

01:03.226 --> 01:06.189
<i>Which puts you at 10%.
For both.</i>

01:06.239 --> 01:08.189
You can stop recording now.

01:08.548 --> 01:09.603
[grunts]

01:10.501 --> 01:12.955
<i>Took long enough for you to show.</i>

01:13.430 --> 01:14.876
[roars]

01:14.928 --> 01:17.879
[grunting]

01:18.336 --> 01:22.048
Iron Man, what are you doing
fighting these guys on your own?

01:22.202 --> 01:24.410
I appreciate your concern, Hulk.

01:24.435 --> 01:27.827
Concern? I almost slept
right through the smashing.

01:27.852 --> 01:28.992
<i>Now!</i>

01:29.815 --> 01:30.678
Hulk!

01:30.703 --> 01:32.984
[groaning]

01:35.348 --> 01:37.348
[groaning continues]

01:37.538 --> 01:39.952
[groaning]

01:42.072 --> 01:44.262
What happened? I don't...

01:44.287 --> 01:48.080
Banner. Always good to see you,
but maybe now is not a great time.

01:49.373 --> 01:50.961
You can say that again.

01:51.952 --> 01:55.152
Sync and corrections by <font color="#808040">masaca</font>
- addic7ed.com -

02:02.455 --> 02:05.375
Human again? But how?

02:05.400 --> 02:07.160
<i>Power's back to 20%.</i>

02:07.808 --> 02:11.315
Turn back into the Hulk now! You
won't last five seconds in this.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.291
By my estimate you're being generous.

02:14.054 --> 02:16.015
[groaning]

02:16.884 --> 02:20.528
You need a little help getting riled
up there, Mr. "I'm-Always-Angry"?

02:20.553 --> 02:21.366
[grunts]

02:21.503 --> 02:24.462
I never have before.
It doesn't make any sense.

02:24.858 --> 02:27.486
Well, your B.O.'s
even worse than the Hulk's,

02:28.829 --> 02:32.170
- and you're kinda useless in a fight.
- More!

02:32.195 --> 02:34.261
<i>Maybe I can help.
How's this?</i>

02:34.286 --> 02:38.643
<i>You finally have a puny body
to match your puny mind, Bruce!</i>

02:38.668 --> 02:41.320
That voice.
It's so familiar.

02:41.345 --> 02:43.362
<i>Ha! So long, Mister...</i>

02:43.387 --> 02:44.032
[grunts]

02:44.978 --> 02:46.778
The Hulk never runs from a fight.

02:46.814 --> 02:49.988
You're not the Hulk.
So stay put or get smashed.

02:50.581 --> 02:52.329
[grunting]

02:59.246 --> 03:00.633
[Banner] Get away from him.

03:02.713 --> 03:06.032
- So now you're cribbing my Stark Tech?
- I'm innovating.

03:07.202 --> 03:09.921
Maybe it's time
for a little reflection.

03:11.121 --> 03:12.784
I couldn't agree more.

03:15.168 --> 03:17.448
<i>We have what we need. Let's go.</i>

03:21.715 --> 03:23.682
Go, science bros.

03:25.686 --> 03:28.937
[Falcon] According to these bio-scans,
Bruce's gamma levels are way below normal.

03:28.989 --> 03:30.696
Normal for him at least.

03:30.721 --> 03:32.450
Tony, what's the bottom line?

03:32.475 --> 03:35.295
The Hulk is basically
a walking gamma reactor.

03:35.388 --> 03:37.328
Somehow he's been cooled down.

03:37.353 --> 03:38.858
Can't we start him back up?

03:38.866 --> 03:42.405
I don't know... make him sit too
close to the microwave or something?

03:42.430 --> 03:44.295
Or perhaps a jump start.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.285
Microwave? Lightning?

03:46.310 --> 03:49.061
It was a precisely
calibrated gamma wavelength

03:49.086 --> 03:51.620
that would be nearly
impossible to recreate.

03:51.645 --> 03:53.002
[Falcon] We may not need to.

03:53.042 --> 03:55.881
Your cells are still generating
residual gamma radiation.

03:55.883 --> 03:58.391
Good catch, Falcon.
Like burning embers.

03:58.416 --> 04:00.685
If they smolder long enough,
they can restart.

04:00.721 --> 04:04.348
But it will take time to get to his
transformation point... If ever.

04:04.373 --> 04:05.477
[Iron Man] Bottom line...

04:05.502 --> 04:07.659
You can skip the stretchy
pants for awhile.

04:07.694 --> 04:10.990
Meanwhile, any idea who
your SteelCorps buddy might be?

04:11.015 --> 04:13.799
His voice was so familiar,
but I can't place it.

04:13.867 --> 04:16.202
Take some time.
Maybe it'll come to you.

04:17.571 --> 04:18.653
[alarm blares]
[door opens]

04:18.704 --> 04:19.982
- Huh?
- Bank robbery in progress.

04:20.007 --> 04:22.012
- Let's go.
- I'm coming too.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.709
It's just a bank robber.

04:24.734 --> 04:26.284
<i>[roars]
[static]</i>

04:26.309 --> 04:27.857
It's the Abomination.

04:29.253 --> 04:30.381
Maybe I'll go...

04:30.554 --> 04:32.617
stop an online hacker or something.

04:32.642 --> 04:33.411
<i>[roars]</i>

04:34.244 --> 04:35.720
<i>[lasers shooting]</i>

04:37.069 --> 04:38.476
<i>[beep]</i>
[groans]

04:38.501 --> 04:40.266
I call foul play!

04:40.291 --> 04:43.937
Using your tiny fingers
is an unfair advantage.

04:43.962 --> 04:44.785
Hmm!

04:49.636 --> 04:51.870
[groaning]

04:51.905 --> 04:54.783
[grunts, sighs]

04:54.942 --> 04:57.913
Titanium woven sheets seemed
like a good idea at the time.

04:58.662 --> 05:01.746
[whirring]
[arrow whooshing]

05:03.750 --> 05:04.995
Can I join in?

05:05.020 --> 05:05.583
[chuckles]

05:05.608 --> 05:06.837
Yeah, no thanks.

05:06.853 --> 05:10.526
Last time we sparred, you
thunder-clapped me into a wall.

05:11.282 --> 05:13.591
Those warheads.
I can power them up for you.

05:13.627 --> 05:15.658
Eh, knock yourself out.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.192
Gimme!

05:22.956 --> 05:23.660
Huh.

05:23.837 --> 05:27.299
Maybe this "All-Banner- All-the-Time"
ain't such a bad thing.

05:29.258 --> 05:30.809
I'm glad you stopped sulking.

05:30.861 --> 05:32.694
But you're giving Hawkeye an upgrade?

05:32.729 --> 05:35.425
I'm also de-powering
his Hulkbuster arrows.

05:35.782 --> 05:38.191
Don't tell him, but they really sting.

05:39.575 --> 05:41.032
Hand me the wire stripper.

05:41.377 --> 05:45.160
And Cap's helmet... I think there's a way
to make it withstand more force.

05:45.464 --> 05:46.633
Static probe?

05:47.480 --> 05:50.820
Reminds me of our first time nerding-out
together back on the Helicarrier.

05:51.024 --> 05:51.885
Spanner?

05:52.933 --> 05:55.512
I've been such a fan of your whole
rage monster thing,

05:55.544 --> 05:58.631
I forgot how much I missed having
my old science bro around.

05:58.839 --> 06:00.784
The big guy tends
to take over sometimes.

06:01.276 --> 06:05.528
And to be honest, it was nice to just
let someone else drive for awhile.

06:05.779 --> 06:07.812
Ugh! Got a good whiff
of that guy's breath

06:07.848 --> 06:10.180
and figured out why
they call him the Abomination.

06:10.352 --> 06:11.783
You missed a good fight.

06:11.818 --> 06:13.891
We did some work while you were gone.

06:15.128 --> 06:16.322
It's half the weight.

06:16.905 --> 06:19.801
And twice as strong.
And Hawkeye, I increased

06:19.826 --> 06:23.688
the output power of your arrows
by drawing on their own kinetic energy.

06:24.382 --> 06:25.965
That's amazing.

06:26.104 --> 06:28.955
Yeah, we're not used
to you leaving things,

06:29.056 --> 06:31.206
you know, the opposite of broken.

06:31.231 --> 06:32.921
[alarm blaring]

06:33.713 --> 06:37.085
Attack on the East River
Nuclear Reactor. SteelCorps.

06:37.110 --> 06:39.002
They're not even trying
to hide who it is.

06:39.083 --> 06:41.932
Like they don't even care if we
show up and kick their butts.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.280
Us? You got lucky last time.

06:44.305 --> 06:47.357
No way you're fighting
armored supervillains today.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.124
Avengers... Except you, sorry.

06:50.424 --> 06:51.723
Assemble!

06:59.147 --> 07:01.426
<i>Set the reactor to overload.</i>

07:02.059 --> 07:03.393
[Thor] I think not.

07:06.673 --> 07:07.772
Stop them!

07:10.939 --> 07:11.816
[groans]

07:13.955 --> 07:15.095
[both groan]

07:18.283 --> 07:19.159

[groaning]

07:32.953 --> 07:34.596
<i>Anybody miss me?</i>

07:36.874 --> 07:38.244
The Hulk!

07:40.707 --> 07:42.605
Not quite.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.852
Is that my Hulkbuster armor?

07:46.534 --> 07:49.915
As long as he is on our side,
I do not care.

07:53.853 --> 07:56.991
[lasers firing]
[arrow whooshing]

07:58.892 --> 07:59.974
[grunts]

08:05.196 --> 08:08.946
<i>Not War Machine, not Iron Patriot.</i>

08:08.971 --> 08:11.232
<i>What exactly are you?</i>

08:11.513 --> 08:12.997
An Avenger!

08:13.106 --> 08:18.012
<i>Bruce? Even with that cobbled-up
tech, you're useless!</i>

08:18.073 --> 08:21.152
I'm...not...useless!

08:24.889 --> 08:26.483
Igor Drenkov?

08:26.617 --> 08:29.007
Of course! Igor Drenkov.

08:29.032 --> 08:29.687
[scoffs]

08:29.857 --> 08:31.058
Who's Igor Drenkov?

08:31.270 --> 08:32.712
My old lab partner.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.751
We worked together back during
the Super Soldier program.

08:36.916 --> 08:39.198
But... but the gamma explosion!

08:39.224 --> 08:40.923
You were never found.

08:40.948 --> 08:41.866
[screaming]

08:41.890 --> 08:42.979
You're dead.

08:43.962 --> 08:45.970
Presumed dead.

08:46.296 --> 08:47.188
[groans]

08:47.637 --> 08:49.699
All these Gamma-tech thefts!

08:49.909 --> 08:52.348
Are you trying to recreate
the accident?

08:52.566 --> 08:56.645
Replicate the explosion that turned
me into the Hulk? Why?

08:56.670 --> 09:00.683
Because I was the one who should
have absorbed the gamma rays.

09:00.708 --> 09:04.740
I should have gotten the power
and become the celebrated hero.

09:04.765 --> 09:07.938
Everyone within 100 miles will be
caught in the nuclear meltdown.

09:07.963 --> 09:12.630
You know as well as I do that some losses
are acceptable for science.

09:12.655 --> 09:16.549
And your demise is something
I find quite acceptable.

09:17.544 --> 09:21.100
The only one who's losing
here today is you, Drenkov!

09:22.457 --> 09:27.821
<i>Your time as a hero... In fact,
all your time is up, Banner.</i>

09:31.079 --> 09:35.653
- We have to stop the meltdown.
- <i>It's already too late.</i>

09:35.655 --> 09:37.436
<i>[laughing]</i>

09:40.088 --> 09:42.118
<i>[Drenkov laughing]</i>

09:42.994 --> 09:44.377
Thor, lightning blitz!

09:45.661 --> 09:47.867
<i>No need to destroy the Avengers.</i>

09:47.892 --> 09:50.091
<i>The reactor will do that for me.</i>

09:50.997 --> 09:52.326
It's about to go critical.

09:52.351 --> 09:53.413
I'll shut it down.

09:53.438 --> 09:55.698
There's gotta be an emergency backup.

09:55.883 --> 09:58.069
Banner, there's no safe distance now.

09:58.103 --> 10:00.769
We could use whatever you have
left in that muscle-suit.

10:00.794 --> 10:02.561
Muscle won't stop this.

10:03.382 --> 10:05.794
We have to override
the meltdown sequence.

10:05.914 --> 10:08.738
- Tried. Can't be overridden.
- Then go deeper.

10:08.763 --> 10:10.963
Activate back door safeguard protocols.

10:11.382 --> 10:12.083
[alarm blaring]

10:12.108 --> 10:15.212
Complete lock-out. There's no way
to stop the nuclear reaction.

10:15.237 --> 10:17.972
No, but it can be cooled down.

10:18.024 --> 10:21.777
Just like I was. The East River!
It's not far.

10:21.802 --> 10:23.957
We can divert it into
the adjacent tunnels.

10:24.222 --> 10:27.497
- Even the Hulk can't punch a river.
- But I can.

10:29.365 --> 10:32.198
Remote control punch.
Not bad.

10:36.837 --> 10:40.124
Need to calculate
the exact blast point.

10:44.397 --> 10:45.808

10:51.991 --> 10:54.211
<i>[computer] Reactor temperature stable.</i>

10:55.061 --> 10:58.814
<i>This will happen, Banner!
You cannot stop it.</i>

10:59.065 --> 11:00.497
<i>[sighs]</i>
Whew.

11:00.522 --> 11:01.645
Great work.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.819
Never do that again.

11:03.962 --> 11:06.549
What? I just saved the city.

11:06.574 --> 11:09.421
Even with that suit,
you're not the Hulk.

11:09.541 --> 11:12.797
Maybe when I use my brain,
I'm better than the Hulk.

11:12.822 --> 11:16.881
Tony's right. Until we figure
out how to help you Hulk out again,

11:16.916 --> 11:19.092
let the rest of the Avengers
take care of this.

11:19.155 --> 11:21.220
If all you want me for is muscle,

11:21.377 --> 11:24.255
why don't I just invent you
a teched-up battering ram?

11:28.893 --> 11:30.544
Think this is funny, Goldilocks?

11:30.592 --> 11:35.032
I do. But it was good to see
my old friend back in action.

11:38.561 --> 11:40.567
I'm not your experimental toy.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.056
And we're not playing.

11:42.081 --> 11:44.216
Falcon, how are those embers doing?

11:44.333 --> 11:48.530
Weird. According to this, your gamma
signature's back to its original level.

11:48.555 --> 11:51.587
You could have changed back
into Hulk during the fight?

11:51.612 --> 11:53.020
Why didn't you?

11:53.045 --> 11:54.889
Because I didn't need to.

11:55.359 --> 11:58.398
I could tell when the gamma particles
had finally powered up again,

11:58.423 --> 12:02.195
but when I heard Drenkov say that I was
only a hero because I was lucky...

12:02.622 --> 12:05.955
Luck didn't stop
that reactor, but I did.

12:05.988 --> 12:08.701
But what if the suit hadn't
worked as you planned?

12:08.726 --> 12:10.856
And your stingers
are better protection?

12:10.881 --> 12:12.872
There's a brain inside the muscle.

12:12.897 --> 12:14.527
Why can't anyone see that?

12:14.631 --> 12:19.187
Because it's who you are, Bruce.
You have one catchphrase: "Smash!"

12:19.212 --> 12:21.864
You're on this team because
you're the strongest there is.

12:21.889 --> 12:24.862
The Avengers already have a
smartest there is, and that's me.

12:25.513 --> 12:29.510
Maybe the fact that I can be strong
and smart just scares you all.

12:30.196 --> 12:31.626
I need some air.

12:33.565 --> 12:35.130
[grunts]
Hey, watch it.

12:38.422 --> 12:41.524
He's my favorite, Dad.
The guy that smashes.

12:49.975 --> 12:51.291
[powering up]
[quietly fires]

12:52.044 --> 12:52.810
[gasps]

12:52.940 --> 12:53.587
Wha...

12:53.946 --> 12:56.695
[groans, yells]

12:56.720 --> 12:57.605
[groans]

13:02.356 --> 13:04.999
<i>[Drenkov]
Time to wake up, Bruce.</i>

13:05.356 --> 13:06.399
[sighing]

13:07.761 --> 13:08.925
[groans]

13:11.063 --> 13:13.030
[charging up]

13:14.285 --> 13:15.159
Huh?

13:17.307 --> 13:20.560
I was so obsessed with
recreating the experiment,

13:20.585 --> 13:24.274
that I never thought to draw
straight from the source.

13:24.299 --> 13:26.683
Now I can destroy you

13:26.745 --> 13:28.451
while I become you.

13:28.476 --> 13:32.061
But the other guy might have
a problem with that plan.

13:32.262 --> 13:34.095
[grunting]

13:35.308 --> 13:37.699
- Huh?
- Don't bother.

13:38.081 --> 13:41.219
I'm bombarding you with
gamma-inhibiting particles.

13:41.350 --> 13:44.190
You won't be "Hulking out"
anytime soon.

13:44.463 --> 13:48.153
This device will extract
the gamma directly from you,

13:48.178 --> 13:51.660
store it and then channel it into me.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.829
With SteelCorps' tech
and the Hulk's power,

13:54.854 --> 13:58.440
I will be the hero
I should have been all along.

13:58.465 --> 14:01.383
[screaming]

14:01.408 --> 14:04.978
Don't worry, the pain
will soon be gone,

14:05.003 --> 14:08.004
because draining every bit
of gamma radiation

14:08.020 --> 14:10.999
will leave you quite dead.

14:12.865 --> 14:13.523
[groaning]

14:13.548 --> 14:15.563
It is almost complete.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.651
Finally, after all these years...

14:18.676 --> 14:22.690
It's mine! The life force of the Hulk.

14:22.724 --> 14:26.393
[screaming]

14:26.604 --> 14:27.687
[sighs]

14:30.530 --> 14:34.089
Excuse me, I'm looking for a lost
science bro. Have you seen him?

14:40.127 --> 14:41.964
Huh. These things aren't so bright.

14:41.989 --> 14:42.675
[both groan]

14:42.710 --> 14:43.925
What was that again?

14:44.211 --> 14:44.999
[arrow whooshes]

14:45.647 --> 14:48.151
Cover me.
I'm goin' for Bruce.

14:53.505 --> 14:55.588
You look tired.
Take a seat!

14:55.640 --> 14:57.674
[crackling]

14:57.957 --> 14:59.647
Path is clear, Widow.

15:00.062 --> 15:01.754
Not totally accurate.

15:03.790 --> 15:05.757
Hawkeye, hit somewhere good.

15:05.988 --> 15:06.607
[arrow whooshes]

15:06.632 --> 15:07.299
That's it!

15:07.324 --> 15:08.059
[grunts]

15:11.540 --> 15:13.440
You'll have to take this
from here, genius.

15:13.475 --> 15:14.494
Thanks.

15:15.041 --> 15:16.402
[Widow] On my way, Cap.

[crackling]

15:18.144 --> 15:19.120
[groans]

15:21.664 --> 15:27.359
All the gamma radiation is mine.
I won't be stopped! Not now!

15:33.762 --> 15:37.126
[groans, growls]

15:38.024 --> 15:39.246
Incoming!

15:41.383 --> 15:45.048
SteelCorps! Move the gamma
battery to the secure lab.

15:45.073 --> 15:48.779
I'm more than strong enough
to take on the Avengers.

Huh?

16:26.581 --> 16:29.218
I can hack this lock.
Then what?

16:29.243 --> 16:31.017
"Puny Banner" rushes in?

16:31.843 --> 16:34.557
No. They rush out here!

Here we go.

17:19.566 --> 17:22.648
They need me...
All parts of me.

17:23.169 --> 17:26.335
Without the scientist,
I couldn't have gotten in here,

17:26.605 --> 17:29.754
and without the big guy,
I'm not getting out!

When I gain your remaining
gamma powers,

19:22.717 --> 19:27.054
the world will celebrate
me as its greatest hero.

19:27.475 --> 19:30.388
You're missing one thing
that I still have.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.128

19:54.558 --> 19:57.253
That inhibitor... drainer... er... thing.

19:57.273 --> 19:59.924
That machine will take away
his gamma powers.

20:01.328 --> 20:04.765

[groans]

20:42.269 --> 20:44.613
Real power comes from inside...

20:45.635 --> 20:47.598

So, does this mean you're back
to being human again?

21:01.731 --> 21:04.683
For the moment. I figure
I can use my smashing downtime

21:04.708 --> 21:07.532
to pick up your slack in the
smartest there is department.

21:07.779 --> 21:09.163

You strongest.
Me smartest.

21:11.644 --> 21:13.968
Oh, yeah? Then how'd
you miss the cosign value

21:13.993 --> 21:16.021
- on that formula?
- Hm?

21:16.370 --> 21:17.828
I'll fix it for you.
