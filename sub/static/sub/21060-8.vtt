"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.467 --> 00:36.533
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.100
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.133 --> 00:41.000
in a court of law.

00:42.967 --> 00:46.700
-Policewoman: Fort Myers is
located in the southwest region
of Florida.

00:46.733 --> 00:50.867
My biggest interest in this job
is getting the firearms
off the streets,

00:50.900 --> 00:53.700
gettin' some good drug arrests,
gettin' those people
off the street,

00:53.733 --> 00:57.167
that, you know, are a sore
to our community.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.300
Makes me feel good to actually
be able to, you know,

01:00.333 --> 01:02.800
have a part in
cleaning it up a little bit

01:02.833 --> 01:04.667
and making it safe for my kids.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.533
-(siren chirps)
-Woman (over radio): Ten-four.

01:07.567 --> 01:11.467
-Santos: This vehicle, um,
the tag appears to be obstructed

01:11.500 --> 01:13.933
by the plate, so we're gonna
stop it, check out

01:13.967 --> 01:16.967
with the vehicle driver
and see what's goin' on.

01:21.900 --> 01:25.133
600, final's gonna be
Ballard and Lora.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.500
Go ahead and put your hands
on the steering wheel
for me, please.

01:30.533 --> 01:31.833
Thank you.

01:31.867 --> 01:33.900
I'm Officer Santos
with the Fort Myers
Police Department.

01:33.933 --> 01:35.233
-How are you, sir?
-Fine.

01:35.267 --> 01:36.900
-Very good.
The reason I pulled you over

01:36.933 --> 01:39.200
is your tag is obstructed
by your plate.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.133
-What do you mean?
-The license plate?

01:41.167 --> 01:43.300
-What do you mean?
-You know, your license plate?

01:43.333 --> 01:44.633
-Yeah.
-Yeah, it's covered up.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.800
It's not supposed to be
covered up.

01:46.833 --> 01:48.733
-I've never had
a problem with that.
-Is this your vehicle?

01:48.767 --> 01:51.067
-Yes, it is.
-All right. Do you have
your registration?

01:56.800 --> 01:59.800
Do you have your ID
with you, sir?
Can you hand it to him, please?

01:59.833 --> 02:02.800
-Passenger: No, I don't have ID.
-You don't have an ID?
Can you give him your name?

02:02.833 --> 02:04.200
-Yes.
-Policeman: What is it?

02:04.233 --> 02:06.100
-Otis. Yes, sir.
-Otis?

02:06.133 --> 02:08.300
-Is there anything
in the vehicle that's illegal,

02:08.333 --> 02:12.567
any firearms, any contraband,
anything like that? No?

02:14.133 --> 02:16.700
All right. You mind if I look
in the vehicle at the end
of the stop?

02:19.067 --> 02:20.533
-You mind look in the vehicle?

02:20.567 --> 02:22.067
-Yeah, do you mind
if I look in the vehicle,

02:22.067 --> 02:24.567
make sure there's
nothing illegal in the vehicle?

02:24.600 --> 02:27.867
-I wouldn't want that.
-You don't want me to.
Okay, no problem.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.733
All right, just hang tight.

02:31.933 --> 02:33.200
Did you smell anything?

02:33.233 --> 02:34.900
-No, I didn't smell nothin'.
-No?

02:34.933 --> 02:36.233
That guy Otis, though, uh...

02:36.267 --> 02:37.800
-He's not making
any eye contact?

02:37.833 --> 02:41.067
-He's got some-- CCW, a prior
for cocaine possession.
-Yeah.

02:41.100 --> 02:44.767
The passenger's super nervous.
He's gotta have
something on him.

02:44.800 --> 02:48.433
I'm gonna have K-9 come out
and do a free air sniff
of the vehicle.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.867
-Miller: Hey, man,
you got a light in this car?

02:51.900 --> 02:53.600
No?

02:53.633 --> 02:56.700
-(car door opens)
-Miller: No! Hey!

02:56.733 --> 02:59.600
-Santos: 10-79! Bravo 600!

02:59.633 --> 03:01.500
Let me see your hands!

03:01.533 --> 03:04.533
-Policeman: Let me see
your hands! Let me see
your hands now!

03:07.100 --> 03:09.300
-Man: All right, all right,
I'm down! I'm down!

03:09.333 --> 03:10.833
I'm down!
-(officer screams
unintelligibly)

03:10.867 --> 03:13.400
-I'm down! I'm down!

03:13.433 --> 03:14.833
I'm down! Hey, I'm down!

03:14.867 --> 03:16.200
-I got his le--
I got his right arm.

03:16.233 --> 03:18.067
-I got left.
-I'm down, man.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.433
I'm down.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.600
I'm down, man.

03:22.633 --> 03:24.633
Hey, can I get my watch?

03:24.667 --> 03:26.667
I'm down, man.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.433
-(indistinct)

03:29.767 --> 03:31.367
-Woman (over radio):
10-4, 21-31.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.100
-He threw somethin' back there.
-Man: I ain't got any.

03:34.133 --> 03:36.133
I ain't got nothin', man.

03:36.167 --> 03:37.800
-What were you reachin' for
when you were running?

03:37.833 --> 03:39.800
-I wasn't reachin' for nothin'.
-All right, to your knees.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.633
-(K9 dog barking)

03:41.667 --> 03:43.800
-Why'd you decide
it was a good idea to run?

03:43.833 --> 03:46.333
-'Cause I'm on probation.
I know I ain't supposed
to be out here, man.

03:46.367 --> 03:48.667
-State probation?
-Man: Prison.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.867
-(K9 dog barking)

03:50.900 --> 03:54.467
-He threw somethin'.
-Santos: What'd he throw?

03:54.500 --> 03:56.333
Can you take a picture
when I open it?

03:56.367 --> 03:57.600
-Go ahead.

03:59.367 --> 04:03.200
-Woman (over radio):
High drama, 600...
on that 10-50, 10-4.

04:05.733 --> 04:08.100
-Santos: That's gotta be--
it looks like a Glock 40.

04:12.867 --> 04:14.733
It's fully loaded, one in.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.667
I should clear the chamber
to make it safe.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.533
-Woman (over radio):
501, go ahead.

04:18.567 --> 04:19.700
Man (over radio): 10-97.

04:21.300 --> 04:26.733
-Santos: Looks like...
four bullets in the mag
and one in the chamber.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.867
-Policeman:
Hey, William, when you
get a chance, come here.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.267
-(indistinct radio transmission)

04:31.300 --> 04:34.100
-I get my phone, sir?
-We'll get it for you
in a minute. Take a seat.

04:34.133 --> 04:36.800
-(indistinct radio transmission)

04:38.200 --> 04:40.433
-Well, this is where
we detained the subject.

04:40.467 --> 04:42.233
Uh, he was holding
this purple bag.

04:42.267 --> 04:45.467
We saw it both in the car
and out here again
next to his wallet.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.300
(indistinct)... she had checked
what was in here.

04:50.333 --> 04:54.333
Looks like a couple little
baggies, containing some sort
of white, powdery substance.

04:54.367 --> 04:56.733
I don't know if you could tell
from the inside or not.

04:56.767 --> 04:59.500
We're gonna take it back
to the car, and that's where
we'll do our testing and such.

04:59.533 --> 05:03.100
Take all this together
as it is now, and then test it
when we get back to the car.

05:03.133 --> 05:06.300
And this is his wallet
and everything.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.300
-Santos: All right, sir,
go ahead and step out now.

05:09.733 --> 05:13.067
All right, face the vehicle.

05:13.067 --> 05:14.967
All right.

05:15.067 --> 05:17.833
All right, you're gonna be
free to go, all right?

05:19.433 --> 05:24.167
There was your passenger there,
your friend, he did have

05:24.200 --> 05:29.867
a loaded firearm on him,
and some drugs we did find.

05:29.900 --> 05:33.633
So, you did the right thing,
you stayed in the vehicle,

05:33.667 --> 05:36.833
cooperated, and that's why
you're goin' home tonight,
all right?

05:37.900 --> 05:39.967
Do you have
any questions for me?
-No.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.667
-This is test number three.
-Cocaine.

05:43.700 --> 05:47.367
-We did the crack, which tested
positive for cocaine.
We tested the heroin,

05:47.400 --> 05:49.900
which also tested positive
for the presence of heroin.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.733
Now, this is a small plastic bag
containing a white powder,

05:52.767 --> 05:55.067
which is-- we're gonna suspect
that it's cocaine.

05:55.067 --> 05:58.067
We're gonna test it
here in a second
and find out what it is.

06:02.767 --> 06:06.267
Turn it for me.
Should take a small portion
of it, drop it in,

06:06.300 --> 06:11.800
and then when you mix it,
the color will, uh, turn,
determining what it is.

06:11.833 --> 06:15.067
-(tapping tube)
-Where's it at?

06:15.067 --> 06:17.833
So crack and cocaine
turn blue in color.

06:17.867 --> 06:21.167
So you see there, in the middle,
it turns, like, a faded
light blue there?

06:21.200 --> 06:23.833
-Mm-hm.
-Showing the presence
of crack cocaine--

06:23.867 --> 06:26.567
well, cocaine at this point.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.433
-Santos: You had
the firearm... on you,

06:29.467 --> 06:31.500
and you had the drugs on you,
which you threw.

06:31.533 --> 06:34.333
All right, so you're goin'--
you're goin' to jail for that.

06:34.367 --> 06:37.333
-I don't know what you're
talkin' about. He, uh...
-Okay, all right.

06:37.367 --> 06:40.400
That's-- That's fine.
I gotta let you know that
you are goin' to jail for that.

06:40.433 --> 06:43.767
-He say he gonna let me
get some-- two numbers
out of my phone?

06:43.800 --> 06:45.067
-We'll get you
your phone at the jail.

06:45.067 --> 06:46.767
You'll be able to grab
numbers out of it, all right?

06:49.967 --> 06:53.067
-Santos: At this point
he's got possession
of the crack cocaine,

06:53.100 --> 06:58.600
uh, possession of heroin,
uh, also possession
of a firearm, uh,

06:58.633 --> 07:02.267
by a convicted felon,
and then he'll also get--
obviously get--

07:02.300 --> 07:04.633
obstruction for-- for running.

07:04.667 --> 07:07.167
But all in all,
we did good, guys. Good job.

07:10.067 --> 07:11.667
-Policeman: Before I was
a police officer,

07:11.700 --> 07:14.800
I was a bartender
at a local Italian restaurant.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.700
Bein' a bartender,
you talk to a lot of different
people, strike up conversations,

07:17.733 --> 07:20.567
things like that.
Most of this job is talkin'
to people, and every time

07:20.600 --> 07:22.600
you go to a call,
you're tryin' to figure out
what happened,

07:22.633 --> 07:24.433
and get the story from people.

07:24.467 --> 07:27.567
We're headed to a, uh, assault
and battery in progress.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.933
A female caller statin' there's
an intoxicated male,

07:30.967 --> 07:34.767
uh, who battered her boyfriend.
Subject still on scene, and, uh,

07:34.800 --> 07:37.667
I guess, 'causin'
problems between her
and some other people

07:37.700 --> 07:39.700
at the, uh, residence.

07:51.067 --> 07:53.133
-(knocking on door)
-Woman: Come in!

07:53.167 --> 07:55.400
-(small dog barking)

07:57.333 --> 07:59.067
-Man: He's on the back porch.
-Who's "he"?

07:59.100 --> 08:00.800
-Ken.
-Who called?

08:00.833 --> 08:04.067
-My girlfriend.
-Ken: Right here, sir.
We're havin' a domestic dispute.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.067
-Here, come out here
and talk to us.

08:07.067 --> 08:10.433
What's goin' on?
-He's been drinking.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.067
-Who's he?
Leave that open.

08:12.067 --> 08:13.333
-His name is Kenneth,
he's on the couch.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.733
I just don't want
my dog getting out.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.500
-That's all right.
We won't let the dog out.

08:16.533 --> 08:19.633
What's his relationship to you?
-Just a friend.
He's been drinking.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.733
-Does he live here?
-Yes.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.400
-The three of you live here?
-Yes.

08:22.433 --> 08:25.833
-Okay, it's you, Walter's
your boyfriend, and then Kenny
is just a friend?

08:25.867 --> 08:28.167
-Right, right.
-Okay, no relationship
to Walter either?

08:28.200 --> 08:30.233
-Kenny and Walter
have known each other
for 20 years.

08:30.267 --> 08:31.933
-Okay. All right,
so just good friends, then.

08:31.967 --> 08:33.500
-Yeah.
-So what set him off?

08:33.533 --> 08:36.633
-He's been drinking.
When he's drinking,
he's a nasty person.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.900
-Kenny?
The gentleman on the couch?
-Yes.

08:38.933 --> 08:42.367
-Okay.
-Apparently I ate a whole loaf
of bread, which I didn't.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.067
-Okay.
-I asked Walter last night,
I thought it was Walter's bread,

08:46.067 --> 08:48.500
I said, "Do you mind if I have
two slices of bread?"

08:48.533 --> 08:51.133
and Walter's like,
"No, no, no, no problem."

08:51.167 --> 08:54.333
Kenny grabbed my hair.
Apparently, it was his bread,

08:54.367 --> 08:57.267
and he pulled my hair,
saying I'm a liar.

08:57.300 --> 09:01.933
And apparently, while I was
upstairs, he was supposedly
playing with my dog again.

09:01.967 --> 09:03.867
-Okay, so he just--
he just pulled your hair.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.700
Did he strike you
or touch you in any other
kind of way?

09:05.733 --> 09:07.800
-No, he just
yanked my hair really hard.
-Where were you guys at

09:07.833 --> 09:11.067
when he pulled your hair?
-I was in my puppy pen
tryin' to calm my dog down.

09:11.067 --> 09:14.067
-Okay. You guys were
verbally arguin' when
he pulled your hair?

09:14.067 --> 09:16.600
-I have been tryin' to be nice
all night long.
-Okay.

09:16.633 --> 09:19.200
-Hey, Walter?
Come talk to me
for just a second?

09:19.233 --> 09:21.067
I want to have a conversation
with Walter.

09:21.100 --> 09:24.500
-Woman: And Walter's
been tryin' to help
Kenny out because, you know,

09:24.533 --> 09:26.367
he's had no place to stay.
-Okay.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.500
Okay, you witnessed
what happened?

09:29.533 --> 09:31.467
-I didn't witness,
but I heard everything.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.067
-Where were you at
when it took place?

09:33.100 --> 09:35.333
-I was in my room.
-Okay, so you didn't actually
see anything happen?

09:35.367 --> 09:37.900
-No.
-What did you
hear at least?

09:37.933 --> 09:42.833
-I heard, uh, Kenny
and, uh, Anna, getting
into an argument and everything,

09:42.867 --> 09:45.967
and I came out
tryin' to find out
what was goin' on.

09:46.067 --> 09:49.433
And then Kenny started
throwin' me around and told me
it was none of my damn business.

09:49.467 --> 09:51.267
-Kenny started
throwin' you around?
-Yes.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.400
-How so?
You don't gotta show me,
but just kind of describe

09:53.433 --> 09:56.567
to me how he was...
-He hit me right in the middle
of my chest.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.067
-He hit you in the chest?
-Yes.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.733
-Anna: He did. Pushed--
Knocked him so hard,
he went flying down

10:00.767 --> 10:03.167
to the floor.
-All right.
Let me go talk to your buddy

10:03.200 --> 10:06.233
and see what we got
goin' on here.

10:06.267 --> 10:07.633
Hey, man.
-Hello.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.033
-Can you tell me
what's goin' on?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.867
-Excuse me, sir?
-Can you explain to me
what happened?

10:10.900 --> 10:13.000
What occurred
between you and your
roommates here?

10:13.033 --> 10:15.800
I got pieces of the story, man,
you just gotta put it
all together for me.

10:15.833 --> 10:20.333
-But I'm gettin' a--
-It's just nothin' more
than a misunderstanding.

10:20.367 --> 10:22.333
-Well, now I just want you
to tell me what happened.

10:22.367 --> 10:23.700
No, we're not goin' there yet.

10:23.733 --> 10:25.667
I talked to them, it's only fair
that I get your side, man.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.133
All you gotta do is tell me
what's goin' on.

10:27.167 --> 10:28.867
-What happened?
-What happened, where?

10:28.900 --> 10:30.600
When?
-Right here.
When you guys

10:30.633 --> 10:34.100
got in the argument
about the bread
and the dog, okay?

10:34.133 --> 10:37.433
-I haven't done nothin', sir.
-Okay. So you guys
got in an argument,

10:37.467 --> 10:39.300
you came here,
sat on the couch,
and that was it.

10:39.333 --> 10:42.633
-And that's
pretty much my story.
-But an argument took place,

10:42.667 --> 10:44.467
let's start with that.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.833
-When you come in here
and take my food,

10:46.867 --> 10:48.967
and you feed your dog my food--

10:49.000 --> 10:54.400
Here, it all started back
when she fed the dog eggs...

10:56.100 --> 10:59.533
that belonged to me.
-Okay.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.667
-It all started from there.
-Mm-hm.

11:01.700 --> 11:07.833
-When you feed a dog food first,
before a human,

11:07.867 --> 11:09.467
how did it start, sir?

11:09.500 --> 11:12.333
I don't know.
-Okay, you didn't grab Anna
by the hair?

11:12.367 --> 11:14.767
-No.
-What about you and Walter?

11:15.767 --> 11:17.967
-Walter, me? Uh, no.

11:18.067 --> 11:21.067
-Okay, nothin' physical
happened between you and Walter?

11:21.067 --> 11:24.500
-It was verbal.
-It was verbal only
between all three of you?

11:24.533 --> 11:27.467
-Yes.
-All right.
Hang tight, buddy,

11:27.500 --> 11:29.200
I'll send somebody back in here
for you, okay?

11:30.367 --> 11:32.867
Do you guys wanna pursue
charges with him?

11:32.900 --> 11:34.567
-Yes, I do.
-Ma'am?

11:34.600 --> 11:37.933
-My dog.
-Okay. Did you see
him push him?

11:37.967 --> 11:41.867
-Yes, I did. Yes.
-So he just kind of
came at you for no reason?

11:41.900 --> 11:43.867
Or did you try to intervene
between the argument...

11:43.900 --> 11:46.933
-I tried to intervene.
-Okay. So that's what kind of
set him off a little bit?

11:46.967 --> 11:51.167
-Yes. (groaning)
-Can you sit?

11:51.200 --> 11:52.700
-What is it?
What hurts?

11:52.733 --> 11:54.767
-He needs to sit.
-Well, just sit down
right where you're at, boss.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.833
-(groans)
-Come on.

11:56.867 --> 12:00.067
-Go on and sit down.
-He hit me good,
my heart murmur's actin' up.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.667
-You want paramedics?
-Yes.

12:01.700 --> 12:04.600
-Anna: When I called 9-1-1,
he did threaten me.

12:04.633 --> 12:08.367
He says, "I'm gonna kill you
if you call the police.
Hang up now."

12:08.400 --> 12:11.067
-Okay. Can I have
fire rescue respond?

12:11.067 --> 12:14.200
Uh, someone at my call
is complainin' of, uh,
chest pain, heart condition.

12:14.233 --> 12:18.467
-Anna: I would like the
information on the restraining
order against my dog.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.100
-We can get that to you, okay?

12:20.133 --> 12:23.067
Well, paramedics
are on their way,
they'll check you out, boss.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.667
-Kenneth,
we're walkin' this way.
-I didn't do anything!

12:25.700 --> 12:27.667
-All right.
-I've done nothing.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.467
-Well, listen,
I got a statement
from your buddy,

12:29.500 --> 12:31.100
I got a witness
that corroborates
that statement,

12:31.133 --> 12:33.167
and then I've got injuries
consistent with what
he told me.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.367
That's why he got transported
to the hospital.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.200
You got anything on you?
-What?

12:37.233 --> 12:38.667
I'm tellin' you, sir.

12:38.700 --> 12:39.800
-What?

12:43.967 --> 12:45.467
All right, have a seat, boss.

12:48.667 --> 12:51.433
-You know somethin'?
Let me ask you a question.

12:51.467 --> 12:54.467
-Okay.
-If you got kicked
in between the nuts,

12:54.500 --> 12:56.733
what would you do, sir?
-Did you get kicked
in the nuts?

12:56.767 --> 12:57.967
-Yes.
-Okay.

12:58.067 --> 13:00.467
-By her.
-I gave you plenty
of opportunity to give me

13:00.500 --> 13:03.600
your side of the story.
I've marched in there
three or four times

13:03.633 --> 13:06.267
and asked you to explain to me
what was goin' on.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.467
Okay?
And now you're in handcuffs
in the back of a police car,

13:09.500 --> 13:12.267
and you wanna
remain credible.

13:12.300 --> 13:16.833
-Yes, I wanna remain credible.
-Okay. Well, we're done
playing games.

13:16.867 --> 13:20.400
So, right now,
you're gonna go to jail
for, um... for battery.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.333
-I didn't do nothin'!
-All right, well, it is
what it is.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.767
-Ken: If you wanna take me
to jail, take me to jail.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.700
But a dog doesn't come
before a human.

13:31.300 --> 13:34.533
-Policeman: People tend
to tell me I have a real
interesting childhood.

13:34.567 --> 13:35.900
I was born in Chicago.

13:35.933 --> 13:38.467
My parents had a real bad
substance abuse problem.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.067
Due to that, we ran
from the drug dealers
from Chicago

13:41.100 --> 13:42.433
all the way down to Tampa.

13:42.467 --> 13:44.633
At the age of 13, I was
in a homeless shelter.

13:44.667 --> 13:48.700
Pretty much raised myself,
and I decided to be
a law enforcement officer

13:48.733 --> 13:55.133
because I wanted to help people,
and help take some of the crime
off the street.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.600
-(siren chirps)
-I'm stoppin' this car
that ran a red light

13:57.633 --> 14:00.133
back there.
Swervin' a little bit.

14:00.167 --> 14:04.667
Looks like he's havin'
some difficulty maintainin'
his lane up here.

14:04.700 --> 14:08.667
Uh, looks like he's
gonna pull over just up ahead.

14:08.700 --> 14:14.433
33...(indistinct)
I'll just be pullin' over
on Washington Avenue,

14:14.467 --> 14:16.467
south of Ulmerton.

14:16.500 --> 14:20.567
Oh my God.
Um, he hit the curb.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.400
-(indistinct radio transmission)

14:33.400 --> 14:35.667
-(indistinct radio transmission)

14:38.167 --> 14:39.533
-Show me your hands
right now.

14:39.567 --> 14:41.267
Show me your hands!

14:41.300 --> 14:43.300
33, give me the channel.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.633
Put your hands
where I can see 'em right now.

14:45.667 --> 14:48.567
Gun's on the back seat.
Don't move, you understand?

14:48.600 --> 14:50.367
-Yes.
-Do you understand?

14:50.400 --> 14:52.167
-Yes, sir.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.200
-33, I got a signal zero
on a back seat.
Send me another unit.

14:56.233 --> 14:59.400
Don't move for that gun,
you gonna get shot!

14:59.433 --> 15:02.900
-What?
-If you reach for that gun,
you're gonna get shot.

15:02.933 --> 15:06.233
Don't move!
Keep your hands
out the window right now!

15:08.367 --> 15:11.067
-(sirens approaching)

15:17.900 --> 15:20.533
-Keep your hands
out of the window!

15:20.567 --> 15:25.100
Driver! Left hand,
grab that outside door,

15:25.133 --> 15:28.733
and open it.
Keep the right hand
out of the window.

15:28.767 --> 15:30.367
Put the car in park!

15:30.400 --> 15:31.867
Watch him.
Watch him.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.133
Put the car in park.
Is the car in park?

15:36.167 --> 15:38.867
-Yes, sir.
-All right.
Face away from me,

15:38.900 --> 15:40.933
keep your hands up,
get outta the car.

15:40.967 --> 15:44.300
Do it now.
Face away from me.
Get out of the car.

15:44.333 --> 15:47.167
Face away from me!
Keep your hands up!

15:47.200 --> 15:48.633
All the way in the air!

15:48.667 --> 15:52.167
Grab your back collar
of your jacket, pull it
all the way up.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.100
All the way up, over your head.
Turn around, do a 360.

15:55.133 --> 15:58.067
Do a 360, keep turning,
keep turning away from me.

15:58.067 --> 16:01.567
Stop!
Walk back to the sound
of my voice until I tell you

16:01.600 --> 16:03.200
to stop, keep walkin'.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.967
Keep walkin'.

16:05.067 --> 16:08.400
Stop!
Go down to your left knee.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.367
Do everything slow.
Do you understand?

16:12.400 --> 16:15.467
-Go down to your other knee.
-All the way down?

16:15.500 --> 16:17.367
-No. Stay right there.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.933
-All right?

16:23.267 --> 16:24.767
Hey, let me get one
over here.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.867
I'm gonna clear this car.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.100
-(siren sounding)

16:27.133 --> 16:29.100
It's clear.
Do you still see the gun
back there?

16:31.833 --> 16:35.067
Don't even think this is
gonna be a real gun.
It feels like a BB gun.

16:37.967 --> 16:40.067
It's gonna be a BB gun.

16:45.633 --> 16:48.233
Got some marijuana.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.800
Got some crack bags
down here.

16:55.167 --> 16:57.200
(sighs)

17:04.567 --> 17:08.400
I already know what this
is gonna be. It's probably
gonna be marijuana wax.

17:08.433 --> 17:10.067
No, got some pills.

17:10.067 --> 17:12.300
But might be some needles
in here.

17:17.433 --> 17:19.833
-Hello, Sheriff, how you doin'?
-How's it goin', brother?

17:19.867 --> 17:21.167
-I'm all right.
-What's your first name?

17:21.200 --> 17:22.367
-Austin.
-Austin?

17:22.400 --> 17:24.600
-Yes, sir.
-All right, Austin,
I'm Deputy Curry.

17:24.633 --> 17:26.067
All right?
-Nice to meet you.

17:26.067 --> 17:28.967
-We're gonna go
from starters, all right?

17:29.067 --> 17:32.067
I pulled you over
because, uh, you ran
the red light back there

17:32.067 --> 17:36.800
on 110 and 113th, all right?
So I followed you swervin'
all the way

17:36.833 --> 17:38.667
down the road.
Then I light you up,

17:38.700 --> 17:42.067
you looked like
you were coverin' somethin' up
over there on the driver's seat,

17:42.100 --> 17:43.700
all right?
-You scared me.

17:43.733 --> 17:46.767
-At which point I came onto
the car... I saw the gun.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.933
-Yeah.
-All right, so that's why
everything happened

17:48.967 --> 17:50.800
to where it's at,
just to catch you up...
-It's a BB gun.

17:50.833 --> 17:52.200
-Yeah, I figured that out.
-Okay. (laughs)

17:52.233 --> 17:54.633
-What are you doin' with that?
-Uh, it's just somethin'

17:54.667 --> 17:56.867
that I have because I got
a two-year-old daughter,

17:56.900 --> 17:59.267
and I like
to take her out shootin'.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.900
-With a BB gun?
-Yeah.

18:00.933 --> 18:02.533
-All right, it's probably
not somethin' you wanna

18:02.567 --> 18:04.067
keep on your back seat,
especially if you're

18:04.100 --> 18:05.600
gonna get stopped by us
and runnin' red lights

18:05.633 --> 18:07.367
and stuff.
-Yeah. Well, it's
completely empty.

18:07.400 --> 18:11.367
It was just like...
I dropped her off on Friday.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.867
-Uh-huh.
-This past Friday.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.533
-Uh-huh.
-So I just haven't had time
to take it out.

18:16.567 --> 18:19.233
-All right.
Well, I got a few charges
that you're lookin' at

18:19.267 --> 18:21.400
right now, okay?
Once I'm done
with my investigation.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.933
You're lookin' at
at least, um, possession
of drug paraphernalia,

18:24.967 --> 18:27.700
and misdemeanor possession
of marijuana.
-Roger.

18:27.733 --> 18:30.800
-All right, once I identify
the pill, then I'll probably
come back and tell it to you

18:30.833 --> 18:33.267
I've determined what that is.
-Yeah.

18:33.300 --> 18:36.233
-You're probably gonna be
lookin' at a charge
for that as well, okay?

18:36.267 --> 18:38.900
-To be honest, sir, like,
it really isn't mine.

18:38.933 --> 18:40.400
I'm bein' honest with you.
-All right.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.133
-I'm bein' honest with you.
-All right, that's fine.

18:42.167 --> 18:45.500
I really appreciate it.
-I don't take-- I don't
even know what that is...

18:45.533 --> 18:47.200
-All right.
-...to be honest.

18:47.233 --> 18:50.233
-Just standin' here
talkin' to you, based
on your drivin' pattern

18:50.267 --> 18:53.900
and after I'm addin'
everything together,
also have a reason to believe

18:53.933 --> 18:56.133
that you were operating
that vehicle while
under the influence

18:56.167 --> 19:00.300
of alcoholic beverages
or drugs, okay?
Which is pretty much a DUI.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.800
-I'll be more than happy
to take a Breathalyzer
right now.

19:02.833 --> 19:05.567
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
-I'll consent to that.
I don't drink.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.433
-Well, a DUI is not just
all about drinkin' either.
It has to do with

19:08.467 --> 19:10.600
bein' on drugs
and stuff like that, too.
-Oh, yeah, actually,

19:10.633 --> 19:12.700
my DUI before was for pot.
-Yeah.

19:12.733 --> 19:15.333
-So I completely understand
about that.

19:15.367 --> 19:17.133
-All right. You're
the registered owner

19:17.167 --> 19:19.300
for this car?
-No, that's my sister's car,

19:19.333 --> 19:20.633
and she lets me use it.
-Uh-huh.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.800
All right.
Well, sit tight for me,
I'll be back, okay?

19:22.833 --> 19:24.367
-Okay.
-All right.

19:27.667 --> 19:31.267
So I got a DUI, he's gonna be
en route, they're gonna do
an investigation.

19:31.300 --> 19:34.267
I just ran his name
through the computer here.
It looks like he has a warrant

19:34.300 --> 19:37.500
out of one
of the neighboring counties
for another drug possession

19:37.533 --> 19:41.167
charge.
So once he's done
with everything over here,

19:41.200 --> 19:45.067
he'll go over there,
take care of his charges
that he has over there.

19:45.067 --> 19:50.067
Just looks like
