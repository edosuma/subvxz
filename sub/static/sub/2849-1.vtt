01:50.694 --> 01:53.443
I don't wanna go to school.

01:56.867 --> 02:00.703
- I said I don't wanna go to school.
- Oh, is that what that was?

02:00.704 --> 02:01.912
Mom.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.498
You can't stay here with
me all day, Sophia.

02:04.499 --> 02:08.336
But I can help you. I know how to
pick up the phone when it rings.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.422
You know how to do a lot of
things. You are very smart.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.090
Smarter than me, definitely.

02:13.091 --> 02:16.385
- Then why do I have to go to school?
- I'll make you a deal.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.680
This weekend, I'll show you how
to use the washing machine.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.433
- I can help you fold the sheets?
- Yes, you can.

02:22.434 --> 02:26.270
Go finish getting ready for school.
Car pool's gonna be here in a second.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.065
<i>You're listening to Greene
County Public Radio.</i>

02:29.066 --> 02:31.859
<i>In today's weather, it's
gonna be cold and cloudy.</i>

02:31.860 --> 02:35.780
<i>High temperature's gonna reach 30.
Overnight low's dipping down to 20.</i>

02:35.781 --> 02:37.990
<i>Watch out tonight on
some of the roads.</i>

02:37.991 --> 02:40.868
<i>Warming tomorrow, but not
too much, high around 40.</i>

02:40.869 --> 02:43.371
<i>Gonna stay that way for
the rest of the week.</i>

02:43.372 --> 02:46.666
<i>Lake Festival gets under way
Saturday. Hope you can join us.</i>

02:46.667 --> 02:48.540
<i>We'll have a booth there...</i>

02:50.879 --> 02:52.421
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.807
- Sorry.
- Hey.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.851
We fell asleep.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.809
Billy said it was fine.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.061
Mom, I'm ready.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.151
Come on down.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.200
<i>She said all right
She said all right</i>

03:21.201 --> 03:22.785
- Hi, Stella.
- Hi.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.535
Okay, babe. Let's get this off.

03:25.872 --> 03:30.251
- Mom, I forgot to feed Mr. Jones.
- Oh, that's okay, baby. I'll do it.

03:30.252 --> 03:33.504
- Denise will pick you up at 3. I love you.
- I love you too.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.214
- Bye, Stella.
- Bye.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.917
Thanks, Barb.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.499
Shit.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.417
<i>The last two times we spoke,</i>

04:54.418 --> 04:57.087
I told you a concern had been
raised about the suitability

04:57.088 --> 05:00.549
of an environment like this
for a child as young as...

05:00.550 --> 05:01.926
Her name is Sophia.

05:01.927 --> 05:06.633
Given the high rate of turnover of a
mostly transient, mostly male population.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.724
And the local girls.

05:08.725 --> 05:12.645
We're leaving but the winters are
slow here. There's nothing I can do.

05:12.646 --> 05:16.774
Unfortunately it is still unacceptable by
the legal standards enforced by the state.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.401
What's that?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.445
You have two weeks

05:21.446 --> 05:24.073
to relocate Sophia to
a suitable location.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.284
Failure to do so will result
in her being removed.

05:27.285 --> 05:30.454
- What do you mean?
- This is a commercial property

05:30.455 --> 05:34.750
with multiple reports of
drug use and prostitution.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.920
Your choice to use it as your
place of residence cannot...

05:37.921 --> 05:40.965
We're leaving, I told you
that, but I can't afford it.

05:40.966 --> 05:44.677
There's always placement until you
get your feet back on the ground.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.388
We have families who'd be
happy to take Sophia...

05:47.389 --> 05:49.890
- Could you stop it?
- These are good families.

05:49.891 --> 05:53.095
- Would you stop it? Please.
- It will only...

05:54.771 --> 05:56.939
I'd rather be dead.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.771
Then you have two weeks.

06:13.707 --> 06:18.127
Was dating this chick, and
she's Russian, right?

06:18.128 --> 06:21.922
And I understand every eighth
word, right? Ha-ha-ha.

06:21.923 --> 06:25.673
Her dad bought her tits for her,
ever heard of something like that?

06:26.011 --> 06:29.763
They're big and they're hard, got
them done back in the homeland.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.716
It was, like, fucking hilarious.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.564
Ugh.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.151
It's cold, right?

06:42.694 --> 06:45.487
My stomach's been eating
itself for the last hour.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.823
We should probably
fill up again anyways.

06:47.824 --> 06:51.198
You never know when the next gas
station's gonna be out here.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.782
That cool, right? Yeah?

06:58.960 --> 07:01.083
All right, cool.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.165
- Mom?
- Mm?

07:04.299 --> 07:08.302
Stella Bradshaw says no one's
really supposed to live at a motel.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.429
You're supposed to
stay one or two nights

07:10.430 --> 07:13.265
and then leave and go
back to your real house.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.393
- Stella Bradshaw said that?
- Yes.

07:16.394 --> 07:20.022
How many bathrooms do you think
Stella Bradshaw has at her house?

07:20.023 --> 07:23.067
- I don't know.
- Maximum two.

07:23.068 --> 07:26.362
You know how many bathrooms
you have? Twenty-two.

07:26.363 --> 07:30.659
More than they have in Buckingham
Palace. You know what that makes you?

07:31.409 --> 07:33.077
A princess.

07:34.120 --> 07:38.200
- Mom, you're crazy.
- Crazy like a fox.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.254
I love you, baby.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.459
- I love you too, Mom.
- Close your eyes.

08:34.431 --> 08:39.136
<i>I wish someone were laying here</i>

08:39.436 --> 08:43.063
- Here you go. Find everything you need?
- Yeah, totally.

08:43.063 --> 08:46.650
<i>Got somebody to dream about</i>

08:46.651 --> 08:50.105
<i>Got somebody to dream about</i>

08:56.870 --> 09:00.040
Mother-fuck, it's cold outside.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.005
So listen,

09:08.006 --> 09:11.175
the thing is, I've been driving
for 22 hours straight.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.218
I could use a little shut-eye.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.928
I have schedule to keep.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.138
I know, I know.

09:16.139 --> 09:19.058
- They do not like to wait.
- No, no.

09:19.350 --> 09:23.020
But we're good.
We're real good on time.

09:23.021 --> 09:26.315
We got a whole day for the
last couple hundred miles.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.110
I can see a motel from here.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.906
We check in separately.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.986
We sleep for four hour, then drive.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.035
- Cool.
- Four hour.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.955
Four hours, got it.

10:07.649 --> 10:08.941
- Hello.
- Yes.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.902
I would like quiet room
for one night, please.

10:11.903 --> 10:15.030
Forty-four dollars, please,
and you'll need to fill...

10:15.031 --> 10:18.340
- ...one of these out.
- Do you have pen?

10:18.366 --> 10:21.604
Yeah, that one works
just fine right there.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.884
Fill out your name, home address,

10:35.885 --> 10:38.508
and your license plate
number, please.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.557
I walk from diner.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.886
Huh? Did you eat?

10:46.104 --> 10:47.681
What?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.940
Did you eat? It's good there.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.648
No.

10:52.944 --> 10:57.775
Was it busy? I was hoping for
some of that run-off, you know?

10:59.200 --> 11:04.746
All right. And I'll need to
xerox your ID, please, sir.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.244
I will pay cash.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.789
Yep, still need your ID.

11:09.252 --> 11:12.171
I have a friend who's
a cop in town.

11:12.589 --> 11:16.550
He's always going on
about me xeroxing IDs.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.298
So...

11:21.806 --> 11:23.599
Well, everybody has job.

11:56.674 --> 12:00.052
He was 15 minute late.

12:00.053 --> 12:04.474
But I checked and
everything was there.

12:05.516 --> 12:09.971
Yes, I will cross border
first thing in the morning.

12:10.104 --> 12:14.942
Jacques, it is a pleasure to be
working for your father again.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.771
Please thank him for the opp...

12:41.719 --> 12:43.717
Give me that pipe.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.268
- Ow. Motherfucker.
- Shut the fuck up.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.353
You shut the fuck up.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.647
- Come on, you dumb bitch.
- Ow.

13:17.171 --> 13:22.843
Ow! What the...? Get
the fuck off me! Ow!

13:22.844 --> 13:25.638
Get the fuck off me! Aah!

13:26.097 --> 13:29.301
What the fuck's going on up there?

13:36.232 --> 13:38.900
What did you do? No, get away!

13:38.901 --> 13:40.944
- Get away from me!
- I'm sorry!

14:01.883 --> 14:05.303
- Hey, everything all right?
- The fuck was that?

14:07.972 --> 14:10.721
- Hey!
- I called the police.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.090
Hello?

14:48.471 --> 14:50.298
Open up.

15:06.781 --> 15:09.780
Somebody call 911.

15:28.970 --> 15:33.056
John roughs up Gwen,
Gwen slashes John,

15:33.057 --> 15:36.682
and John manages to shoot
her before bleeding out.

15:36.978 --> 15:41.479
You wanna sit here and say, "No,
forget it. It couldn't happen." And then...

15:42.817 --> 15:44.894
it happens.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.565
That's some non-fiction
right there, you know?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.908
I just saw Gwen this morning.

15:51.909 --> 15:57.240
Mm. Hey, how's Sophia
doing? Is she okay?

15:57.498 --> 16:00.500
Denise got her. She didn't
see anything, thank God.

16:00.501 --> 16:04.045
That's great. Good. Oh, no, no.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.500
Floyd, shit for brains,
the Jeep. The Jeep.

16:09.677 --> 16:13.222
Fucking idiot. I'm sorry. What?

16:14.807 --> 16:18.307
Billy, we have to stop letting
the girls use the rooms.

16:21.898 --> 16:27.944
Yeah, I mean, you know, it's not like
this is ever gonna happen again, Chlo.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.271
I mean...

16:29.614 --> 16:32.782
Besides, you're not the only
one who relies on that cash.

16:32.783 --> 16:36.119
I had a woman in from
social services today.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.540
She told me I got two weeks
to get out of my place.

16:39.707 --> 16:43.537
If she hears about this,
then Sophia's gone tomorrow.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.798
Two weeks?

16:49.300 --> 16:52.427
Hey.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.175
It doesn't matter.

16:54.305 --> 16:58.260
Okay? Because you and I, we're
gonna get through this. Together.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.102
I'm gonna help you, okay?

17:01.103 --> 17:05.273
You and me, just like after Vincent
died. I'm gonna be there for you.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.315
Okay?

17:09.904 --> 17:13.028
- Billy.
- Yeah?

17:13.199 --> 17:16.699
We have to stop letting
the girls use the rooms.

17:20.330 --> 17:23.830
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.373
Thank you.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.939
John Doe and the girl were DOA.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.399
<i>Anyone else there?</i>

17:47.400 --> 17:50.524
As far as we can tell,
he was traveling alone.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.614
Sophia?

18:53.633 --> 18:56.343
I thought everybody had gone.

18:56.344 --> 19:00.639
Ah... Yes, but I believe
these are yours, yes?

19:00.640 --> 19:03.516
You could have left them in
the room, but thank you.

19:03.517 --> 19:07.854
Yes, well, uh, sorry,
but with all the confusion...

19:11.609 --> 19:15.234
Oh. Okay, I see. Okay,
one second, please.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.738
Thank you.

19:19.742 --> 19:22.491
- Aah! Unh.
- Make no sound.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.998
Open this door. Open it!

19:27.708 --> 19:30.543
There's a hundred bucks in the
register, have whatever you want.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.542
Quiet. Where is cell phone?

19:32.672 --> 19:35.125
I don't have... I don't have it.

19:40.346 --> 19:44.892
- Do not lie to me again.
- Okay.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.228
Who else live here?

19:48.229 --> 19:50.605
- Just me and my daughter.
- Where is she?

19:50.606 --> 19:53.817
She's with a friend, they're
coming back here any minute.

19:53.818 --> 19:57.237
The Jeep that was here last
night, where did they take it?

19:57.238 --> 20:00.490
- What Jeep?
- The man who was killed by the whore.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.325
The police towed his car.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.620
Where did they take it?

20:14.046 --> 20:16.669
- Do you feel that?
- Mom!

20:16.674 --> 20:18.133
Hm?

20:18.134 --> 20:19.342
Give me your keys.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.220
You let the little girl and
only the little girl in.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.596
Mommy!

20:23.597 --> 20:26.266
- Or I shoot everyone dead.
- Okay.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.139
Okay.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.483
Mom, Mom, the puppy slept
in the bed with me.

20:35.192 --> 20:38.820
Oh. Was it cozy?

20:38.821 --> 20:41.781
- Yeah.
- They're friends for life, I'm sure of that.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.284
And, hey, how you feeling, hon?

20:44.285 --> 20:48.163
I'm okay. Denise, can you do me
a huge favor? Could you take her

20:48.164 --> 20:52.584
- for a couple more hours?
- No, Mom. Please.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.629
- Come on.
- Listen, I'm sorry, I...

20:56.547 --> 21:00.258
I got a... I got a
double shift in an hour.

21:00.259 --> 21:04.680
Then I got Randall coming over as he does
with about the frequency of a comet.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.469
Denise...

21:10.519 --> 21:12.141
Never mind.

21:13.314 --> 21:16.267
Any other day. You
know I'm good for it.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.154
Get the key.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.615
Ah. You look after your mom, okay?

21:23.616 --> 21:26.194
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:26.410 --> 21:31.662
Okay, baby, you go upstairs and watch
TV while I talk to this man, okay?

21:32.666 --> 21:34.664
Who are you?

21:36.045 --> 21:38.880
I am friend of your mother's.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.423
Upstairs, now.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.562
I ask once last time.

21:58.442 --> 22:01.319
Where would police take Jeep?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.571
If I find out,

22:03.572 --> 22:05.274
will you go?

22:14.917 --> 22:21.921
You will get me that Jeep, or I will
put bullet in your little girl's ear.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.974
<i>Hey, Rodney, it's Billy.</i>

22:30.975 --> 22:34.270
<i>Okay, so look, I got a
'95 white Jeep Cherokee.</i>

22:35.896 --> 22:37.518
Yeah.

22:38.482 --> 22:41.401
Uh... Seventy-eight thousand
miles, give or take. And look...

22:44.905 --> 22:48.199
Uh, sorry. Uh, look, man,
it's gonna be the same deal.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.493
Okay. Wait two weeks,
things calm down,

22:50.494 --> 22:52.787
they'll think it's
going to the heap.

22:52.788 --> 22:56.162
I can't do anything less
than 1300 on this one.

22:58.961 --> 23:01.796
Okay. But hey, man,
look, there's no radio.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.799
I think somebody picked it
before we got to it, so...

23:04.800 --> 23:07.927
Billy, it's Chloe again.
Will you please call me back?

23:07.928 --> 23:09.755
Thank you.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.432
He will call me back.

23:12.433 --> 23:15.807
And he'll get the car to you
clean and easy, I swear it.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.395
Where does this Billy live?

23:24.528 --> 23:27.698
Ah. Little girl...

23:29.408 --> 23:32.827
- you have jacket?
- Of course. Everyone has a jacket.

23:32.828 --> 23:38.751
Of course. Please go get yours.
Huh? We are all going for drive.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.838
<i>Now, follow me.</i>

23:53.182 --> 23:55.475
- Mommy.
- You okay back there, baby?

23:55.476 --> 23:58.145
Can't we play I Spy?

23:59.271 --> 24:02.482
We can play later,
I promise, okay? I promise.

24:02.483 --> 24:04.856
Fine.

24:06.403 --> 24:09.732
I spy with my little
eye, something white.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.870
Here he is.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.084
Go.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.136
You won't hurt her?

24:32.137 --> 24:34.590
That depend on you.

24:34.890 --> 24:39.721
When you come back to
car, you come back alone.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.746
And if it's Stephanie,
tell her to shut up

24:58.747 --> 25:02.793
- about the goddamn...
- All right. Jesus. Relax.

25:09.383 --> 25:12.507
- The fuck are you doing here?
- I need to talk to Billy.

25:15.639 --> 25:19.218
What the fuck do you need to
talk to Billy for, huh, Chlo?

25:20.060 --> 25:23.146
You two don't get enough of
each other at that motel?

25:23.147 --> 25:26.442
And whatever it is the
fuck you do all day.

25:27.151 --> 25:30.025
- Chlo?
- I need to talk to you.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.984
- So talk.
- Amber, inside.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.277
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Shut up and take this.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.202
- You asshole.
- And pause it.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.576
You can fucking rewind it.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.461
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- The Jeep. The Cherokee.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.964
One you picked up last night?
I know a guy who wants to buy it.

25:49.965 --> 25:53.634
It's a good price. I'll take a
little cut. I need the cash, Billy.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.587
What are you talking about?

25:56.221 --> 26:00.224
We know about your deal with Rodney.
The guy doesn't just want the parts.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.645
It's evidence in an investigation.
I can't give that to you.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.271
Since when do you care?

26:06.356 --> 26:08.733
It's evidence.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.983
Soon it'll be paperwork, then
it'll be a cube of garbage.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.990
- Sound like you're on the television.
- Whatever. I can't help you.

26:15.991 --> 26:19.577
So why don't you just...? Just get
out, Chlo. You've done enough.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.372
Maybe I'll just talk to
your chief about it then.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.294
About what?

26:28.295 --> 26:32.500
Maybe he wants to hear about your bait
and switch... Get your hands off me!

26:39.181 --> 26:41.509
Goddamn it, Chloe.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.272
You gotta be more careful.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.080
What did he say?

27:06.083 --> 27:07.708
He said no.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.802
Do you see it?

27:17.803 --> 27:20.638
There's a chain-link fence
and police everywhere.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.182
- Find a way.
- It's blocked in.

27:23.183 --> 27:26.477
I did not need to move it.
We need to get inside.

27:26.478 --> 27:30.022
Behind stereo, inside,
is a package.

27:30.023 --> 27:33.818
It will take you no more
than two minute of prying.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.359
Take it.

27:44.538 --> 27:47.287
Now, get out of the car.

27:55.632 --> 27:59.510
The sound of the shot will
wake your little Sophia.

27:59.511 --> 28:04.467
And she will look around
because she needs her mother.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.811
And she will find her mother,

28:08.812 --> 28:12.607
but she will be splattered
all over the window

28:12.608 --> 28:14.936
and the fucking dashboard

28:15.485 --> 28:18.063
and the steering wheel.

28:18.488 --> 28:21.282
Now, I'm going to count to five.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.368
Trust me when I tell you,

28:24.369 --> 28:27.413
if you do not get out of the car,

28:27.414 --> 28:30.743
you will not hear me say five.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.211
One,

28:33.879 --> 28:35.581
two,

28:36.048 --> 28:39.550
- three...
- Okay. All right. All right. I'll go.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.004
I'm going. Okay.

29:19.967 --> 29:22.010
Wake up, little girl.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.051
Where's my mom?

29:30.852 --> 29:33.145
That is a good question.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.724
Do you see her out there?

29:37.526 --> 29:39.854
What is she doing?

29:40.696 --> 29:42.697
I tell you what.

29:42.698 --> 29:46.277
Let us play the I Spy, huh?

29:46.451 --> 29:48.995
You tell me what you spy.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.665
That's not how you play.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.950
It is how I play.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.966
You can't just change
the rules like that.

30:01.967 --> 30:05.303
Yes, I can. Tell me what you see.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.179
Fine.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.974
Looks like she's trying
to get inside a car.

31:25.050 --> 31:28.254
Okay. Baby, put your headphones on.

31:32.224 --> 31:35.143
It's gone. It's gone.

31:38.939 --> 31:42.393
Whatever was in there, somebody
got to it before we did.

31:43.944 --> 31:46.067
I'm not lying to you.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.530
Take us back to motel.

32:24.693 --> 32:26.315
Come.

32:47.132 --> 32:51.053
I need to know what's gonna happen
next. You can at least tell me that.

32:53.930 --> 32:59.518
Tomorrow morning, you will
talk to your friend Billy,

32:59.519 --> 33:03.440
and you will find out
who worked on car.

33:08.612 --> 33:09.862
What are you doing?

33:09.863 --> 33:12.531
I'm guessing no one's
getting any sleep, right?

33:12.532 --> 33:16.077
I need caffeine, so I'm making tea.
Is that all right with you?

33:21.708 --> 33:23.334
What was in the package?

33:23.335 --> 33:25.003
I was gonna see it anyway.

33:31.301 --> 33:34.094
I'm not gonna sit in silence for
the next however many hours.

33:34.095 --> 33:38.675
As long as you have a gun, I'll be nervous.
As long as I'm nervous, I'm gonna talk.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.932
Was it drugs or money?

33:52.697 --> 33:54.991
It's cash, isn't it?

33:55.575 --> 33:58.119
It's a lot, I bet, huh?

34:02.582 --> 34:06.036
So, what do they call someone
like you? It's a mule, right?

34:09.714 --> 34:12.337
I collect packages...

34:13.885 --> 34:17.931
and bring them to
where they belong.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.128
You wanna know what I think?

34:49.588 --> 34:50.920
No.

34:50.922 --> 34:54.626
I think your employers don't
know about your vision problem.

34:56.511 --> 35:02.218
Maybe it wasn't so bad for a while,
but now you can't hardly see anything.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.392
What are you gonna do, right?

35:07.522 --> 35:10.316
I mean, there's not much
demand for a blind guy

35:10.317 --> 35:13.316
whose only skill is killing people.

35:16.740 --> 35:21.493
Very perceptive for a motel clerk

35:21.494 --> 35:23.992
in this God-forsaken brothel.

35:28.668 --> 35:31.420
What if I told you I knew
where the money was?

35:33.173 --> 35:35.382
We both know where the money was.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.802
I mean, where the money is.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.643
It sounds to me like
you're already fucked.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.562
So either you leave empty-handed,

35:48.563 --> 35:51.815
wait for the people whose money it is
to come, do whatever they're gonna do,

35:51.816 --> 35:55.441
which I'm guessing is
something really bad.

35:56.363 --> 35:58.406
Or maybe...

35:59.366 --> 36:02.240
you think about buying some time

36:02.744 --> 36:05.288
and taking your half of the money.

36:09.626 --> 36:11.703
I see.

36:12.045 --> 36:15.294
And the other half, I presume,

36:15.632 --> 36:18.210
you think is yours.

36:19.636 --> 36:21.213
Hmm.

36:22.097 --> 36:26.725
You have no idea

36:26.726 --> 36:29.103
how in over your head you are.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.563
And you have no idea what it's like

36:31.564 --> 36:34.566
to have a child to feed
and no place to go.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.903
I have been on my own
since I was 15 years old,

36:37.904 --> 36:41.573
scrambling for cash and
nobody gives a fuck.

36:41.574 --> 36:46.075
And I'm not gonna do that again, and
I'm not gonna do that to my daughter.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.598
Little girl,

37:06.099 --> 37:09.678
you are being very reckless.

37:14.149 --> 37:16.192
So we go tomorrow?

37:17.777 --> 37:20.112
And what if I do not care to wait?

37:20.113 --> 37:22.361
You can leave here empty-handed.

37:27.829 --> 37:30.077
So, you got a name?

37:35.003 --> 37:36.796
Topo.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.559
I wanna go lie down
with my daughter.

39:08.721 --> 39:11.306
You were gonna let me use
the washing machine.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.933
I know, baby.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.728
We'll do it next week, okay?

39:16.187 --> 39:20.232
Mommy's got something really
important to do today. I'm sorry.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.480
Okay.

39:23.862 --> 39:27.316
Now, tell Denise I'm putting
your food in the back, okay?

39:35.331 --> 39:39.081
The man in the pictures,
he is girl's father?

39:40.336 --> 39:43.088
Since when have you been
looking at my pictures?

39:43.089 --> 39:44.586
So he left you?

39:45.842 --> 39:47.843
No, he did not leave me.

39:47.844 --> 39:52.595
He was fixing a flat by the side of the
road and a truck hit him and didn't stop.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.267
He was a good man.

39:55.268 --> 39:57.015
I showed up with nothing.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.810
Except the baby in your belly.

40:00.148 --> 40:01.773
What about you, anyway?

40:01.774 --> 40:05.694
You walk alone or something? It's
no big deal your partner got shot?

40:05.695 --> 40:08.569
He was an idiot.

40:08.823 --> 40:11.401
My sister's kid.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.368
Jesus.

40:17.749 --> 40:20.998
Good help is hard to find.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.961
There he is.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.803
And?

40:31.804 --> 40:34.098
He's got a TV, a big flat one.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.390
Give me your phone.

40:39.354 --> 40:40.771
It's a burner, isn't it?

40:40.772 --> 40:44.818
Guy like you doesn't get a bill with
his name on it. Give me your phone.

41:03.878 --> 41:07.503
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go.
Come on. Get the fuck out of here.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.043
- I knew it.
- What?

41:10.343 --> 41:14.548
- What did he do? What did you say?
- I said "I know you have the money."

41:17.058 --> 41:19.643
He's turning. He's turning.

41:19.644 --> 41:22.688
All right, are there cars
between you and him?

41:22.689 --> 41:25.023
Uh, yeah. Two.

41:25.024 --> 41:28.276
Okay, slow down.
Keep your distance.

41:28.277 --> 41:32.447
But try not to make it look like
you are keeping your distance.

41:32.448 --> 41:35.492
- Well, what does that mean?
- Don't look so nervous.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.452
How do you know I look nervous?

41:37.453 --> 41:40.327
Because I can hear it.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.496
Shit.

41:46.379 --> 41:48.707
- Shit!
- Aah.

41:53.177 --> 41:55.175
- Shit.
- What is it?

41:56.723 --> 41:59.725
- Shit.
- Aah.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.849
What are you doing?

42:02.228 --> 42:05.181
- He's pulling a U-turn.
- Did he see you?

42:11.571 --> 42:14.489
- I don't know.
- Find place to turn around.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.366
Get back on main street.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.740
We will catch up to him.

42:22.665 --> 42:25.083
It's him. What do I do?

42:25.084 --> 42:27.127
Turn off your engine.

42:27.503 --> 42:29.546
Turn off your engine.

42:33.342 --> 42:36.386
Step out of the
goddamn vehicle, Chlo.

42:38.014 --> 42:41.391
You let him come to us.
I will take care of it.

42:42.602 --> 42:45.520
Step out of the goddamn car,
Chlo. I'm not gonna say it again.

42:45.521 --> 42:47.348
Do not leave the car.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.779
Stay in the goddamn car.

42:53.780 --> 42:56.656
All right, stop right there.
Turn around, Chlo.

42:56.657 --> 42:59.701
Turn the fuck around.

42:59.702 --> 43:02.530
Good. Now, put your
hands on your head.

43:03.748 --> 43:08.001
Now, back up slow. Keep coming.

43:08.002 --> 43:11.172
Keep coming. Come on.

43:13.716 --> 43:16.544
Come on. Keep coming.

43:18.387 --> 43:20.715
Now, get on your knees.

43:21.474 --> 43:24.723
Drop to your fucking knees, Chloe!

43:28.356 --> 43:30.065
- Billy.
- Shut the fuck up.

43:30.066 --> 43:32.689
Shut the fuck up.

43:41.744 --> 43:45.997
What the fuck do you think you're doing
following me, Chlo, huh? Spread them.

43:45.998 --> 43:49.577
- What are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up and spread your legs.

43:52.797 --> 43:55.250
- Fuck.
- Guess what.

43:55.591 --> 43:58.343
You're gonna tell me what's
going on, understand?

43:58.344 --> 44:02.674
You're gonna tell me, or you'll make me
choke it out of you, you understand?

44:02.974 --> 44:05.225
Huh? You fucking me? You fucking...

44:05.226 --> 44:07.686
You think you're fucking
shaking me down?

44:07.687 --> 44:10.522
After every fucking thing
I did for you, Chlo. Huh?

44:10.523 --> 44:14.273
- After every fuck...
- That is enough.

44:14.694 --> 44:15.986
Okay. Okay.

44:15.987 --> 44:17.529
Easy. Easy, now.

44:17.530 --> 44:20.490
- Hey, easy, easy. Take it easy, man.
- Give me that.

44:20.491 --> 44:24.828
Easy. It's okay. I mean, who the fuck
do we have here now, huh, Chlo?

44:24.829 --> 44:26.288
Shut up. Put these on.

44:26.289 --> 44:28.832
Mind telling me what is
going on here, Chlo? Huh?

44:28.833 --> 44:31.001
I was trying to tell you, Billy.

44:31.002 --> 44:35.755
He made me follow you. He
said that he would kill Sophia.

44:36.924 --> 44:39.634
You gotta do what he says,
Billy. The guy is crazy.

44:39.635 --> 44:43.847
- Okay, pal, look, we can just talk, okay?
- Shut fuck up.

44:43.848 --> 44:46.142
Huh? Can I do something for you?

44:46.976 --> 44:48.553
Hmm?

44:51.439 --> 44:54.939
- Get up. Time we take drive, yes?
- You are so fucked.

45:01.741 --> 45:07.448
So, Mr. Billy, I give
you one last time.

45:08.998 --> 45:10.749
Where is the money?

45:10.750 --> 45:13.627
I have no idea what you
are talking about.

45:13.628 --> 45:18.129
Hm. How much was
the television set?

45:19.675 --> 45:21.259
"The television set"?

45:21.260 --> 45:23.303
It was a nickel, pal. Okay?

45:23.304 --> 45:26.098
About as much as it costs
to go to the movies. Heh.

45:30.436 --> 45:32.638
You make joke...

45:33.940 --> 45:36.359
because you are nervous.

45:36.484 --> 45:38.277
And you should be.

45:39.403 --> 45:44.200
A dumb cop like you.

45:44.742 --> 45:51.039
You like to take it out and
feel it, so you keep it close.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.457
Huh?

45:52.875 --> 45:55.328
Like in your bedroom?

45:55.962 --> 45:58.915
Or maybe under your bed.

45:59.298 --> 46:00.920
Am I close?

46:05.304 --> 46:06.596
We go to his house.

46:06.597 --> 46:09.175
- It's not gonna make any difference.
- Shut up.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.739
This is it.

46:28.703 --> 46:30.826
Is anyone inside?

46:32.039 --> 46:35.083
- Fuck you, old man.
- He has a wife.

46:36.002 --> 46:37.920
Is your wife home?

46:40.631 --> 46:43.383
How am I supposed to know
what she does all day?

46:43.384 --> 46:45.632
Let us find out.

46:45.970 --> 46:52.223
You. Go. If you want your friend
to live, you bring money back.

48:52.096 --> 48:57.894
What the fuck are you
doing in my house? Huh?

48:59.145 --> 49:01.894
Fucking lost or something, honey?

49:02.356 --> 49:05.150
Who the fuck do you think you are?

49:10.114 --> 49:12.362
Get out of fucking car.

49:16.162 --> 49:19.330
Billy give you keys
to our fucking house?

49:19.331 --> 49:22.000
So he can fuck you on our bed?

49:37.808 --> 49:40.768
What...? What the
fuck did you do, Chlo?

49:40.769 --> 49:43.222
- Did you find the money?
- I have it.

49:44.273 --> 49:46.601
You fucking bitch!

51:33.173 --> 51:35.626
What is it? Why are we stopping?

52:00.576 --> 52:02.403
Come on!

52:13.088 --> 52:15.006
We need to go back to motel.

52:21.889 --> 52:24.515
Policeman should have
told us she was inside.

52:24.516 --> 52:27.810
- You didn't have to kill her.
- She was out of control.

52:27.811 --> 52:31.982
Now, we need to get back
to motel to count it.

52:37.613 --> 52:41.658
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

52:41.659 --> 52:47.330
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
bundles including the one you're holding.

52:47.331 --> 52:51.001
All hundreds. Not enough
for what just happened.

53:08.519 --> 53:13.691
You take the cop's gun and you put
it where no one will ever find it.

53:15.693 --> 53:17.395
Take it.

53:50.769 --> 53:53.142
There's a car in the driveway.

54:04.658 --> 54:08.369
- Hey. What are you doing in my place?
- Did you find it?

54:08.370 --> 54:10.788
Yeah. Wasn't where you
said but we got it.

54:10.789 --> 54:13.875
- What's going on? What are you doing?
- What does who do?

54:13.876 --> 54:16.627
Hey. What, you deaf now too?
Half of that is mine.

54:16.628 --> 54:19.464
Get your fucking hands
off me. Get your hands off.

54:19.465 --> 54:21.382
- We're just working here.
- Topo!

54:21.383 --> 54:23.961
- Get the fuck out of my way!
- Let's go.

54:25.220 --> 54:27.138
Topo.

54:30.392 --> 54:32.435
Topo!

55:05.677 --> 55:08.012
Okay, so I say,

55:08.013 --> 55:11.474
tomorrow, why don't you come
back over and sleep over, okay?

55:11.475 --> 55:13.427
Mommy.

55:15.395 --> 55:17.643
Call the police.

55:18.023 --> 55:21.272
- Come with me.
- Mommy.

55:22.319 --> 55:25.773
- What's the matter with Mommy?
- She's fine.

55:37.292 --> 55:38.539
Cops.

55:39.586 --> 55:42.130
Just keep driving.

55:42.339 --> 55:45.383
Heh. Dumb-asses.

55:46.134 --> 55:48.177
How much was in jar?

55:48.178 --> 55:51.055
Twenty-three hundred.
A little more, I think.

55:51.056 --> 55:54.851
- You think?
- Twenty-three and change.

55:54.935 --> 55:57.770
Why? How much was off the package?

55:57.771 --> 56:01.100
- Two thousand exactly.
- That's good.

56:01.358 --> 56:04.485
- You want me to count it again?
- Not necessary.

56:04.486 --> 56:07.656
The money has already been counted.

56:09.449 --> 56:12.493
That's a crazy-ass
bitch back there, huh?

56:13.871 --> 56:15.698
Keep your mouth shut.

56:19.877 --> 56:23.297
And slow down. You are speeding.

56:28.927 --> 56:31.262
Just going back.

56:31.263 --> 56:34.557
You say the assailant forced
you into Officer Banks' home

56:34.558 --> 56:37.602
- to retrieve a package from Banks?
- That's right.

56:37.603 --> 56:40.605
Okay, and upon entering
Officer Banks' residence,

56:40.606 --> 56:43.774
- you were attacked by Banks' wife?
- That's correct.

56:43.775 --> 56:49.653
At which point, the assailant
fired one shot and killed her.

56:51.658 --> 56:53.531
Yes.

56:54.369 --> 56:57.872
So in your opinion, was Officer
Banks known to your assailant?

56:57.873 --> 56:59.245
Excuse me?

57:00.834 --> 57:04.378
- You think they knew each other?
- How would they know each other?

57:04.379 --> 57:06.126
Did Officer Banks say that?

57:06.381 --> 57:09.676
Unfortunately we haven't been
able to locate Officer Banks.

57:10.636 --> 57:14.722
We found the wife and the radiator
where you said he was handcuffed,

57:14.723 --> 57:17.934
but by the time we
reached the crime scene,

57:17.935 --> 57:19.727
he was gone.

57:19.728 --> 57:22.730
Any thoughts, any ideas
where he might be?

57:22.731 --> 57:28.028
No, I... No, I don't know
where Officer Banks could be.

57:28.528 --> 57:31.072
Think there's a chance
he might show up here?

57:31.073 --> 57:32.820
Here?

57:33.033 --> 57:34.359
Why?

57:35.243 --> 57:38.579
He apparently fled the scene
of his own wife's homicide,

57:38.580 --> 57:40.873
he hasn't resurfaced
to make a report.

57:40.874 --> 57:44.460
We honestly don't know what's
going through his mind right now.

57:46.296 --> 57:48.965
Listen, just to be safe,

57:48.966 --> 57:53.763
we'll post a cruiser out front of your
apartment all night long, all right?

58:20.539 --> 58:21.872
Donnie?

58:21.873 --> 58:25.703
<i>Black Cadillac. Quebec plates.</i>

58:25.836 --> 58:27.788
<i>How many are there?</i>

58:30.716 --> 58:33.965
Windows are tinted. Maybe two.

58:34.177 --> 58:35.845
Are you sure?

58:38.932 --> 58:41.976
Yeah. Yeah. There's two. I'm sure.

58:42.477 --> 58:46.063
<i>It looks like they want
you to come over to them.</i>

58:46.064 --> 58:47.857
Right.

59:05.542 --> 59:08.211
You alone out here, holmes?

59:08.879 --> 59:11.958
You know that I am, Jacques.

59:13.592 --> 59:15.590
What's with the glasses?

59:18.096 --> 59:21.596
- No problems.
- Besides you being two days late?

59:22.684 --> 59:25.978
Circumstances. I took care of it.

59:25.979 --> 59:28.230
Oh, you took care of it?

59:28.231 --> 59:32.109
You been out of the game too long,
you forgot how to talk to your boss.

59:32.110 --> 59:36.822
- I am sure that if you ask your father...
- No, dog.

59:36.823 --> 59:39.742
I don't gotta ask nobody nothing.

59:41.620 --> 59:43.454
Of course.

59:43.455 --> 59:45.414
You are right.

59:45.415 --> 59:47.333
It will not happen again.

59:53.006 --> 59:54.879
Get in.

59:56.134 --> 59:57.843
Why?

59:57.844 --> 01:00:00.138
Because Alain is going to count it.

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:46.513
The fuck's <i>quoi ça</i> ?

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.646
The fuck's this supposed to be?

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.482
It is all there.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:56.778
- We were 2000 short...
- Two short?

01:00:57.028 --> 01:00:59.981
Motherfucker, you are way off.

01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:06.704
- I'm sorry?
- Fuck you are.

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:09.203
This package is 50 light, holmes.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:14.086
Check again.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:16.005
I don't need to check again.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:18.166
Where's the fucking rest?

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:20.885
Jacques, listen.

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:24.597
No, fuck that. I don't need that.
I listen all the fuck time.

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:27.474
Listen to my mama, my
girlfriend too, motherfucker.

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:31.478
To my old man who said I should use
Topo, that Topo could use the work.

01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:34.353
And what is with the
fucking glasses?

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.318
I'm gonna count to
five, Topolewski.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:44.526
You tell me where you put the rest.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:48.238
One, two,

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:51.454
three,

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:54.335
four.

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:54.687
Hey, baby, how's Denise's?

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:55.938
<i>Where are you, Mom?</i>

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.314
I'm at home.

01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:59.813
I'm just taking care
of a few things.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.528
<i>Is the man with the
glasses still there?</i>

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:05.073
No, no, the man's gone.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.738
<i>Why is he gone?</i>

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:11.450
<i>Mom?</i>

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:13.163
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:16.417
Baby, I was thinking...

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:22.507
That maybe when I
pick you up tomorrow

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:25.798
from Denise's that...

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:31.512
instead of coming
home, maybe we'll...

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.848
We'll just move.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:38.515
<i>And just leave?</i>

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:41.859
You know,

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:47.407
even if we move, we'll still
have each other, right?

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:54.785
<i>But what about Mr. Jones?</i>

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:58.501
Mr. Jones can come too.

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:02.042
All right, baby.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:04.965
- I love you.
<i>- I love you too.</i>

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:06.508
Sleep tight.

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.711
<i>Good night, Mom.</i>

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.086
Greene County?

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:47.672
Yeah, I think there's been an accident
at the gas station on Route 23.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:50.303
Thank you.

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:32.591
You know that I did not come alone.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.722
You have to leave. There
are police watching.

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:37.808
There ought to be.

01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:39.306
But they are not.

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:43.772
You stole $50,000 from package.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.977
- I still have it upstairs, I can get it.
- Stop!

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:55.319
Imagine my surprise when
my employers found it out.

01:05:56.411 --> 01:06:00.414
But you weren't supposed to take it
back. You were supposed to keep half.

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:03.417
Remember? The plan. Before
you knew I took 50 grand,

01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:06.417
you wrecked my apartment,
and you took my money.

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:15.092
It was insurance.

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:19.475
I was gonna make it right when we
split it, and all's you had to do

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:22.603
was keep your side of the
bargain, but you didn't.

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:26.148
You did the wrong... I did the
wrong thing. I did the wrong thing.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.522
You are afraid.

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:33.949
And when you are afraid,
you talk too much.

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:39.454
- Goodbye, Chloe.
- No.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:42.870
No, please, please. Sophia
doesn't have anyone.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:47.086
Please. Sophia doesn't have anyone.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:58.757
Your half.

01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:07.144
Why are you doing this?

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:11.228
Because good help is hard to find.

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:46.387
Somebody left a bunch
of fucking money here!

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:50.482
Somebody very carelessly just left
a bunch of fucking money here!

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:55.821
I mean, some careless bitch who
was stupid enough to lie to me,

01:07:55.822 --> 01:07:59.242
you just left a bunch of
your fucking money here!

01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:01.702
Hey, hey! Put that
fucking phone down.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:04.577
Put your hands up. Put your
fucking hands up, Chlo.

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:10.252
- What the fuck is this, Chlo?
- It's not what it looks like.

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:13.922
Well, hey, do me a fucking
favor, keep fucking lying to me.

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.425
- I..
- Yeah, keep lying to me, I swear to God.

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:19.630
Keep doing it. I beg of you!

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:24.890
Huh? I mean, where the fu...? Where
do you fucking think you're going?

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:27.269
You think you're going
to fucking Hawaii, huh,

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:30.770
after your little boyfriend
fucking killed Amber?

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.767
Billy.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.902
You're not gonna shoot me.

01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:38.613
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Oh, see? Did you see it?

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:41.491
I shot the fuck out of
your fucking friends.

01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:45.245
I mean, I was discharging my fucking
weapon all over the place, huh?

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:47.205
- You see how I did that?
- I didn't.

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:49.832
No? You didn't fucking
see that? You fuck.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:53.254
You, you're a...

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:58.301
You're a ba... You're
a bad person, Chlo.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.094
You're a bad person.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:03.846
You are... You're a mother
and you're a bad person.

01:09:03.848 --> 01:09:06.933
You're a fucking liar, an
accomplice, you're a murderer.

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:08.602
And you...

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:13.725
You could have been
Mrs. Billy Banks, huh?

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:28.118
Where are you fucking
going, Chlo? Huh?

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:32.460
I'm leaving.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:38.291
Can I...?

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:40.468
Can I come?

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:46.305
Please. Just you and me.

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:48.392
I mean, all you have to
do is say yes, you know?

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:53.854
See what you...?
You see what you...?

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:59.194
You see what you fucking just did?
Why do you always fucking tease, you?

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:02.572
Why...? Why did you make love
to me all those fucking times

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:05.572
if you didn't even mean it?
Why did you do that?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.210
Why did you fucking
do this to me, Chlo?

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:22.008
I'm fucking sorry, Billy!
I'm fucking sorry! I'm sorry!

01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:28.299
Okay, well...

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:31.973
I...

01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:37.107
I know there's more money. And I
know that you know where it is

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:40.983
so tell me where the fuck the rest
of the money is right now, Chlo.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:48.034
Come here. Come here, show me.
Show me. Yeah, come here, show me.

01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:53.583
Don't fucking worry, Chlo. I'm not
gonna fucking touch you. Huh?

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:57.211
Is this it?

01:10:57.879 --> 01:11:00.338
I should have seen
it coming, you know?

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:04.342
Using me just like... Just
like you used Vincent.

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:08.513
Yeah, just like you probably
used those two guys over there.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:49.047
Why did you do it, Chlo?
Why did you do it?

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:52.175
Why did you do it?

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:55.894
Stop. Stop.

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:59.099
Come on. Come on, Chlo. Come on.

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:04.277
Why did you do this to us? Why...?

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:29.192
So you think Billy had been dealing
with these people for a while?

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:33.655
Yeah, yeah, I'd say that Officer
Banks got in way over his head.

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:41.077
Sure you don't want to come down
to the station, talk to someone?

01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:44.578
- I'm anxious to see my daughter.
- Of course you are.

01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:48.585
You two got a place
to go to, right?

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:50.546
Yeah.

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:53.006
We're okay.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.592
Thank you.

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:01.848
Listen, one other thing.
We found this roll of cash.

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:06.061
It was $2300, mostly small bills,
5s, 10s, that kind of thing.

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:08.310
It didn't match the other money.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:11.726
I thought it might be yours?

01:16:13.652 --> 01:16:15.104
No, sir.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.144
Mom!

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.146
Baby?

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:32.981
Baby.

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:34.524
Oh, baby. Mm.

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:36.734
- Oh, you washed your hair?
- Mm-hm.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:39.734
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:42.740
So, baby, you know
what I was thinking?

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:43.950
No.

01:17:43.951 --> 01:17:47.280
I was thinking about what
Stella Bradshaw said.

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:49.411
And I think maybe she's right.

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:54.502
Maybe people aren't
supposed to live in motels.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:56.705
Mom.

01:17:56.964 --> 01:17:58.416
You're crazy.

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:01.044
Mm.

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:05.385
I know.

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:34.453
<i>You can travel all around</i>

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:38.047
<i>Or you can come away with me</i>

01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:44.598
<i>Walk the old way, way, way
way, way, way, oh</i>

01:18:44.623 --> 01:18:49.447
<i>Walk the old way, way, way
way, way, way, oh</i>

01:18:49.448 --> 01:18:54.048
<i>Walk the old way, way, way
way, way, way, oh</i>

01:19:21.715 --> 01:19:31.724
<i>Wrap me in your blankets
Dance me around</i>

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:36.771
<i>Take me back to
where my heart belongs</i>

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:41.696
<i>Qu'Appelle Valley
Oh, Saskatchewan</i>

01:19:41.697 --> 01:19:46.621
<i>Qu'Appelle Valley
Oh, Saskatchewan</i>

01:19:46.622 --> 01:19:52.622
<i>Qu'Appelle Valley
Oh, Saskatchewan</i>

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:14.630
<i>Wrap me in your blankets
Dance me around</i>

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:24.527
<i>Take me back
