WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:04.103
Why don't you come in
and sit down?

00:04.105 --> 00:06.205
- Okay.
- The principal will be
right with you.

00:06.207 --> 00:10.609
( sighs )
boy, being called
into the principal's office

00:10.611 --> 00:13.645
- Really takes me back.
- Just remember, it's not yours.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.148
You were just holding it
for a friend.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.350
So why do you think
the principal called you
in here?

00:18.352 --> 00:19.618
What do you think sam did?

00:19.620 --> 00:22.154
Probably nothing.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.455
She's such
an innocent kid.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.090
Sometimes I wonder
if she's even ours.

00:25.092 --> 00:27.259
She came outta me,
charlie.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.428
Maybe you were just
holding her for a friend.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.131
What if she's just
super sneaky

00:32.133 --> 00:34.099
And has everybody
fooled?

00:34.101 --> 00:35.768
What if she's in a gang
and she's, like,

00:35.770 --> 00:37.703
The biggest drug dealer
in the school?

00:37.705 --> 00:40.172
You looked kinda proud
when you said that.

00:40.174 --> 00:43.142
Well, I just worry about her.
She's so normal.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.411
- She has ocd.
- You're right.

00:45.413 --> 00:48.180
If she were selling drugs,
she'd be super organized.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.249
I mean, they'd be
no seeds in that weed.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.653
Mr. Goodson,
miss goodson,
no, please, sit.

00:56.356 --> 00:58.290
All right,
tell us straight.

00:58.292 --> 01:03.295
And don't leave anything out,
this is our first time.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.297
No, the kids with ocd

01:05.299 --> 01:08.167
Don't cause a lot
of our traditional problems.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.568
By the way,
did you know

01:09.570 --> 01:11.570
That she has her own
meat thermometer?

01:13.506 --> 01:16.241
Cafeteria staff
would really appreciate it
if you took it away.

01:18.745 --> 01:22.548
Well, it was all she wanted
for christmas, but sure.

01:22.550 --> 01:26.118
I'm sorry, miss goodson,
but I really only needed
to talk to charlie.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.120
We need your help.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.155
Our baseball coach
mr. Henderson,

01:30.157 --> 01:32.357
He just left us
to be on a reality show.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.792
Ooh, which one?

01:33.794 --> 01:38.130
I believe it's called
"hook-up island."

01:38.132 --> 01:40.732
Oh, I love that show.
How do you get on that?

01:42.235 --> 01:44.236
I don't know.
I'm sure there's a website.

01:46.239 --> 01:49.508
Look, charlie,
with your background
as a pro ballplayer,

01:49.510 --> 01:52.144
I know the kids
would absolutely love it

01:52.146 --> 01:54.279
If you would manage
their last three games.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.448
- Are you interested?
- Wow.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.684
I gotta be honest,
first time I've ever
been called

01:58.686 --> 02:01.720
To the principal's office
and gotten good news.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.222
Although, there was
that one time, you know,

02:03.224 --> 02:05.491
"you're not the father."
whew.

02:05.493 --> 02:09.328
But, yeah,
I'd love to coach the team.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.164
Uh, excuse me.
Can I have a word
with charlie?

02:12.166 --> 02:15.334
Scheduling stuff
we should work out first.

02:15.336 --> 02:18.570
- We'll be right out.
- Sure, I'll be right
down the hall.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.579
Okay, charlie,
I'm not sure this is
the best idea.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.382
In case you forgot,
you're too competitive,

02:30.384 --> 02:34.353
Part of the reason
I used to be so angry
is because my first coach

02:34.355 --> 02:36.355
Was the meanest,
most competitive
son of a bitch

02:36.357 --> 02:38.223
To ever walk
the face of the planet.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.626
- Wait, who was
your first coach?
- Nah, you wouldn't know him.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.661
Oh, wait,
you did meet him.
My dad.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.663
All right, charlie.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.366
But watch yourself.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.800
Oh, before we go,

02:48.802 --> 02:51.603
There's something
I've always wanted to do.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.373
Bueller, bueller,

02:54.375 --> 02:55.908
Bueller.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.476
Quick, let's go.

02:58.578 --> 03:00.646
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

03:03.283 --> 03:06.185
Listen, jen, I'm gonna be
pretty busy with this stuff
for the next couple of weeks,

03:06.187 --> 03:08.220
So I need you
to take sam for me.

03:08.222 --> 03:11.356
Hey, I'm 15. I don't need
anybody watching me.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.258
That's true.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.561
She was so well-behaved,
we could have left her alone
when she was five.

03:15.563 --> 03:18.363
In fact,
a couple of
times we did.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.567
All you did was
organize your toys
and try to make our beds.

03:21.569 --> 03:24.436
The house
was actually cleaner
when we got back.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.972
Hey, hey, hey, charlie,
congratulations.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.807
I just heard about
the coaching job.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.643
This is the most exciting
thing to happen to
the goodson family

03:31.645 --> 03:33.245
Since jennifer
gave birth

03:33.247 --> 03:35.514
And little sammy
slide into home.

03:35.516 --> 03:39.284
Ew, I just opened
a strawberry yogurt.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.953
Here, son.

03:40.955 --> 03:43.455
I want you to have
my old coaching whistle
for good luck.

03:43.457 --> 03:46.558
Thanks, but I'm actually
gonna use the player's names

03:46.560 --> 03:48.660
Instead of sneaking up behind
them and blowing this thing

03:48.662 --> 03:50.929
And screaming,
"hey, dumbass! "

03:50.931 --> 03:54.399
- I gotta go.
- Well, say, you know,
I was thinking...

03:54.401 --> 03:56.401
Every coach needs
a little help.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.437
- No.
- No, wait-- now listen.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.239
I could be
your assistant.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.974
- No.
- Run the drills
in practice.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.276
- No.
- Pack up the equipment.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.744
- No.
- Mix the gatorade.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.547
- Well, maybe-- no!
- Charlie!

04:08.549 --> 04:09.982
- No!
- Oh, come on, charlie.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.950
I really wanna
do this with you.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.319
I miss the game and who knows
how many more chances

04:14.321 --> 04:16.755
We'll have to be together
doing the thing we love most?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.824
Remember all the good times
we had when you were a kid?

04:18.826 --> 04:20.425
No.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.762
Not with you as the coach,
pushing me,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.697
Making me feel worthless
if I didn't do well.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.432
What kind of father
gives his son a birthday cake

04:27.434 --> 04:29.301
That says,
"nice catch" on it?

04:29.303 --> 04:30.669
Oh, that sounds sweet.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.938
It was written in quotes.
He was being sarcastic.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.508
Come on, charlie.
You could use a hand.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.810
Don't you think this could be
good for you guys?

04:38.812 --> 04:40.879
I mean, maybe you could learn
something from each other.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.448
Yeah, charlie.
Maybe you could
teach me something.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.984
Maybe you're right.
I can teach you something.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.687
I can teach you
how to coach a kid
without screwing him up.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.056
Hey, I'm not too old
to learn there might be
a better way.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.891
You'll be the coach,
I'll be the assistant.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.027
- I'll even throw
away the whistle.
- I'll take the whistle.

04:55.029 --> 04:58.363
My women's defense class
is in a pretty sketchy
neighborhood.

04:58.365 --> 05:01.433
Come on, charlie.
I'll do whatever you want.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.368
You can't ask
for more than that.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.404
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.939
No matter how you feel,

05:07.941 --> 05:10.075
You will support everything
I say enthusiastically.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.810
If I like something,
you like it more.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.446
That is the best idea
I have ever heard.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.647
Not good enough.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.816
The invention
of the wheel

05:17.818 --> 05:21.520
Was a stupid idea
compared to what
you just said, sir.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.423
Okay, you got the job.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.325
- Yes!
- From now on...

05:26.327 --> 05:27.959
I get the last word
on everything.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.695
- Whatever you say.
- Great.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.397
- You can stop talking.
- Will do.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.666
- I mean, now.
- You got it.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.469
Do you even know what
"I get the last word" means?

05:37.471 --> 05:40.105
Am I allowed to answer that?

05:40.107 --> 05:43.008
- No.
- Okay.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.948
Due to some
personal commitments
with my daughter's school,

05:49.950 --> 05:52.984
I have asked dr. Kate wales
to step in as your therapist.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.987
You are in great hands.
You probably won't even
want me back.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.924
I could've told you that
before she even sat down.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.960
Okay, on that note,

06:01.962 --> 06:04.696
I will leave you
to get to know
each other,

06:04.698 --> 06:07.799
But I just gotta say
that I am so proud
of all of you

06:07.801 --> 06:09.701
For handling this transition
so well because--

06:09.703 --> 06:11.503
Are you gonna leave or not?

06:12.605 --> 06:14.072
You might want to examine
the group's denial

06:14.074 --> 06:15.440
About me leaving.

06:15.442 --> 06:17.542
There's a lot
of anxiety here.

06:19.979 --> 06:21.980
Okay, first,
let me say

06:21.982 --> 06:24.149
That my style is a little
different than charlie's.

06:24.151 --> 06:27.886
He tells you a lot
about himself and I don't.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.490
Patrick, why don't you
start us off?

06:31.492 --> 06:34.993
So I'm waiting
for the ups truck
to arrive,

06:34.995 --> 06:37.496
Which, by the way,
your corporate color
is brown?

06:37.498 --> 06:39.765
You know what
brown can do for me?
Change to any other color--

06:39.767 --> 06:42.501
I'm going to stop you
right there.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.835
<i>You're rambling</i>
<i>and that's</i>

06:43.837 --> 06:45.804
Your passive-aggressive way
of punishing us.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.577
Just jump ahead to the part
where you actually got angry.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.546
Okay.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.484
Well, three days later,

06:59.486 --> 07:02.087
I'm in line
at the book store and--
well, those are all gone.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.989
There used to be seven
in my neighborhood, now--

07:03.991 --> 07:06.158
The book stores are gone
and so is my patience.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.492
Moving on.

07:07.494 --> 07:10.128
Nolan?
Nothing.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.530
- Lacey?
- Uh...

07:11.532 --> 07:12.831
Nothing. Ed?

07:12.833 --> 07:15.767
- You're the finest piece--
- nothing.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.037
Okay, people, if this
were an emergency room,
you'd be begging for help,

07:19.039 --> 07:21.473
But instead,
you're just sitting here
in front of me

07:21.475 --> 07:24.943
Bleeding to death,
telling me stories
about the ups truck.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.647
- Nolan.
- Yeah.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.683
- Who are you calling?
- It wasn't charlie.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.621
Come on, todd.
Right now.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.856
You got this guy.
Piece of cake.

07:37.858 --> 07:41.159
- Umpire: <i>Strike three!</i>
<i>- ( groans )</i>

07:41.161 --> 07:44.463
That's the second time
he's struck out chasing
an outside pitch.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.164
- You've gotta rip him
a new one.
- Dad.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.833
You know,
in a supportive way,

07:47.835 --> 07:50.035
So that he grows up to be
a nice, solid citizen.

07:51.604 --> 07:54.506
Hey, todd.
Don't get down
on yourself.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.842
Next at bat's gonna be
a whole new experience.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.844
By the way,
the cute girl
in the second row,

07:58.846 --> 08:00.579
Totally digging
your swing.

08:02.582 --> 08:03.748
That's my sister.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.750
You're a
good-looking family.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.721
See, I never would have
thought of that.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.523
I'd have told him to get
his head out of his ass.

08:11.525 --> 08:14.693
Instead, you gave it
a big, fat kiss.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.529
Is this you supporting me
enthusiastically

08:17.531 --> 08:18.864
And not questioning
my decisions?

08:18.866 --> 08:20.966
Yeah, I'm just saying,
I think it's very sweet.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.701
You got to first base
with that kid.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.870
It's a lot further
than he got.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.639
- Umpire: <i>Strike three!</i>
<i>- Hey, ump!</i>

08:27.641 --> 08:29.508
That was a ball!

08:29.510 --> 08:31.643
You should know
what they look like,
you're mom's got 'em!

08:31.645 --> 08:33.979
She's a freakin' guy!

08:33.981 --> 08:35.981
I like this kid.
He wants to win.

08:35.983 --> 08:38.550
Oh, win.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.852
Is this one of those leagues
where they keep score?

08:42.655 --> 08:44.856
That's what those
giant numbers are
in the outfield.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.725
Of course he wants to win.
We all wanna win.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.893
Just not like that.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.128
Logan, talk to me.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.963
Look, I know you're worked up
because we're down by two

08:51.965 --> 08:53.899
And we should be
beating these guys
like a rented donkey.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.634
What did I do?

08:55.636 --> 08:58.637
Calling the ump's mom a guy,
at best a she-male,

08:58.639 --> 09:00.171
Is crossing the line.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.741
I just wanna win.
This is a bunch of crap.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.677
All right, that's it.
Grab some pine.
You're benched.

09:05.679 --> 09:06.945
Telford,
you're in.

09:06.947 --> 09:11.917
- Charlie, you sure you wanna
bench our best player?
- Hell, yeah.

09:11.919 --> 09:16.721
Instead of encouraging
my anger as a motivator,
it might've changed my life.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.291
Why don't you just
talk to him after the game

09:19.293 --> 09:20.859
So he can help us
win this thing?

09:20.861 --> 09:22.594
Don't you wanna win?
You used to.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.697
I remember a 12-year-old boy
standing out in the front yard

09:25.699 --> 09:27.599
Crying because
he lost a game.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.835
- You locked me
out of the house.
- Because you lost the game!

09:30.837 --> 09:32.771
Which I now realize

09:32.773 --> 09:34.839
Was the very wrong
thing to do.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.207
Do you?

09:36.209 --> 09:40.011
What's next?
The emotionally blackmail
or the tempter tantrum?

09:40.013 --> 09:42.213
Oh, charlie,
I would never
do that to you,

09:42.215 --> 09:45.083
And it makes me sad to think
you might think I would do
something like that.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.285
There's the
emotional blackmail.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.087
All right, fine.
Have it your way.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.322
Maybe you're right.

09:50.324 --> 09:51.656
Maybe I was a bad coach

09:51.658 --> 09:54.125
'cause my kid
ended up a loser.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.094
And there's
the temper tantrum.

09:59.031 --> 10:01.933
I'm really dreading
another session
with kate.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.603
Listen, guys.
I don't think we should be
afraid of this witch.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.904
She's gotta have a weakness.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.807
Sunlight,
pig's blood,
something.

10:08.809 --> 10:09.975
We are smarter than that.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.010
This time,
we get under her skin.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.112
- Follow my lead.
- Oh, my lord.

10:14.114 --> 10:18.083
The second time in my life,
I'm about to take advice
from a gay fella.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.317
When was the first?

10:19.319 --> 10:21.720
I'd rather not discuss it.

10:21.722 --> 10:25.323
But there was a time
during the '70s...
I had a perm.

10:27.927 --> 10:30.195
All right.
Day two.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.063
I hope everyone
has decided

10:32.065 --> 10:34.833
To participate today.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.102
Lacey, you're up.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.971
- Uh...
- Nothing. Nolan?

10:39.973 --> 10:42.774
- I'm scared.
- Nothing. Patrick?

10:42.776 --> 10:44.142
I have something.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.111
I think I speak
for everyone

10:46.113 --> 10:49.247
When I say that
we find it hard
to trust you

10:49.249 --> 10:51.816
And open up
when you've only been
our therapist for a day.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.985
I mean,
all we know about you

10:53.987 --> 10:55.920
Is that you're
from a wealthy family,

10:55.922 --> 10:58.757
You're afraid of intimacy,
and you're into bondage.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.091
( giggles )

11:00.093 --> 11:01.993
Why would you think that?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.995
Wealthy comes from
the double-stitched hem

11:03.997 --> 11:06.965
And the ease with which
you wear a $1,000 blazer,

11:06.967 --> 11:10.135
And the fear of intimacy
comes from the tightness
of the blouse

11:10.137 --> 11:12.003
And the extraordinary amount
of buttons.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.041
And the bondage?

11:16.043 --> 11:17.742
Oh, that was just
a shot in the dark.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.244
I was gonna say
rubber fetish.

11:21.113 --> 11:24.816
I believe "sherlock homo"
hit the nail on the head.

11:25.818 --> 11:28.987
This is all very silly.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.355
Let's get back to you.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.457
No, this is interesting.

11:32.459 --> 11:35.060
I feel much more comfortable
talking to you

11:35.062 --> 11:37.162
Now that I know
you're a spoiled rich girl

11:37.164 --> 11:38.997
Who likes to get spanked.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.131
I can relate.

11:41.233 --> 11:42.967
This is fine.

11:42.969 --> 11:46.137
You're testing me
and I assure you,
I can take it.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.406
I've been teased
my whole life and I learned
to deal with it.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.109
Wow, you're whole life?

11:51.111 --> 11:55.080
That is so sad.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.482
It's not sad, really.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.784
It makes you stronger.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.486
At least,
that's what my dad said.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.189
Your daddy.
I bet he's a good man.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.257
He was the best.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.760
Was? Did he die?

12:08.762 --> 12:10.762
Yes, three years ago.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.098
Oh, I bet you miss him.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.467
No, I'm fine.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.471
( choked up )
I just wish I could talk
to him again.

12:19.473 --> 12:22.941
Can somebody hand me
that box of kleenex?

12:26.846 --> 12:29.414
Please, don't cry.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.249
I know exactly how you feel.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.152
I mean,
I've never mentioned
this in session,

12:34.154 --> 12:37.055
But sometimes
I pick up the phone

12:37.057 --> 12:39.090
And I try to call my mother
in heaven.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.127
( whimpering )
this is why kids should die

12:42.129 --> 12:44.129
Before their parents.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.501
Hey, guys.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.436
Wayne, why are you
wearing a spit guard?

12:51.438 --> 12:54.906
'cause I spit
on a guard.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.541
Got it.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.943
Well, the good news is
a lot of guys couldn't
pull off that look,

12:58.945 --> 13:00.512
But on you,
it works.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.315
You know, charlie,
it would be a lot easier
to hear you

13:04.317 --> 13:05.950
If you could
pull off the hood.

13:06.986 --> 13:09.053
Don't do it.

13:09.055 --> 13:12.390
Sometimes when
we're in the middle of
an anger episode,

13:12.392 --> 13:14.292
We need to have
a de-escalation intervention.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.028
Ooh, that's a time-out.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.097
I just dealt
with this yesterday.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.166
I'm coaching
high school baseball

13:21.168 --> 13:23.535
And I had to bench
my star player for acting out.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.069
Cost us the game.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.938
And his father
didn't stab you?

13:26.940 --> 13:31.009
Man, parents just don't
get involved anymore.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.344
Oh, trust me,
parents got angry,
but I didn't care.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.947
I was trying to teach
these kids how to control
their anger.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.550
But sometimes
there are consequences,
like losing a game.

13:38.552 --> 13:42.053
- Or being
strapped to a chair.
- See, you get it.

13:42.055 --> 13:45.089
Why can't my father
be as well-adjusted as you?

13:45.091 --> 13:48.393
For trying to coach these kids
without bullying them.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.829
So you didn't care about
what the parents thought,

13:50.831 --> 13:53.298
You didn't care about
losing the game,

13:53.300 --> 13:56.267
But you did care about
your father?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.002
Well, yeah.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.071
I thought maybe if I showed him
a different way of coaching

14:00.073 --> 14:01.272
That he'd change.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.542
Charlie,
people don't change.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.412
Do not tell
the parole board
I said that.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.050
Charlie, you didn't wanna
show him a better way.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.418
You wanted his approval.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.453
Why would I want that?

14:15.455 --> 14:17.021
I don't know.

14:17.023 --> 14:20.325
I just say things,
I don't really think
about them.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.627
Why would I want
my father's approval?
I'm a grown man.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.330
I've been through years
of therapy and--
ah, damn it.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.165
I want his approval.

14:27.167 --> 14:30.368
- <i>( alarm blaring )</i>
<i>- everybody, hit the floor.</i>

14:30.370 --> 14:31.970
We're on lockdown.

14:31.972 --> 14:35.106
Uh, I guess
I can leave now.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.308
- Nobody's going anywhere.
- Oh, you don't understand.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.177
I have to leave.
I have a game to coach.

14:39.179 --> 14:42.480
You walk out that door,
you either get tased or shot
by the guards,

14:42.482 --> 14:45.049
Or shanked and raped
by the prisoners.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.119
So the floor, you say.

14:51.324 --> 14:55.560
We should be winning
this thing and we're down
by six runs.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.495
Rodriguez, what the hell's
the matter with you?

14:57.497 --> 14:59.464
Qué pasa, son?

14:59.466 --> 15:02.033
Potter, look at me, boy,
I'm talking to you!

15:02.035 --> 15:03.968
You gotta make
those plays at third base!

15:03.970 --> 15:06.104
You know, your dad went out
for a beer run, I think.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.139
Now I'm starting to think
he went off to buy you a dress!

15:08.141 --> 15:09.240
Get outta my face!

15:09.242 --> 15:11.576
Logan, you're
the leadoff batter.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.311
- Come here,
I wanna talk to you.
- What?

15:13.313 --> 15:16.581
If baseball doesn't
work out for you son,

15:16.583 --> 15:20.351
- Are you planning on
being a comedian?
- Why?

15:20.353 --> 15:22.520
Well, because they're
all laughing at you.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.322
- Shut up!
- What? You gonna hit me?

15:24.324 --> 15:26.357
Go ahead!
It'll be the only thing
you've hit all day!

15:26.359 --> 15:29.127
Now grab a bat,
get your ass out there,
and do some damage!

15:29.129 --> 15:31.029
Now! Move!

15:31.031 --> 15:32.463
What the hell
are you doing?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.365
I'm coaching
a baseball team.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.234
Somebody had to do it
while you were in prison.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.303
I was trying to
rehabilitate murders,

15:38.305 --> 15:40.104
But now I'm starting to
identify with them.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.540
You see all those parents
in the bleachers?

15:42.542 --> 15:45.510
They're all counting on me
to lift this team
to the playoffs.

15:45.512 --> 15:49.314
Logan, laughing at you!
All of them!

15:49.316 --> 15:52.717
Listen to them!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.452
Nobody's laughing
at you, logan.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.287
My dad forgot
to take his meds.

15:57.589 --> 15:59.290
Use the tools
I showed you.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.292
Anger clouds
your judgment.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.294
Anger is the hammer
of judgment!

16:03.296 --> 16:05.296
Bring that
hammer down, son!

16:05.298 --> 16:07.031
My dad's insane.

16:07.033 --> 16:09.000
That's why
his second wife
left him.

16:09.002 --> 16:12.303
- Keep your cool.
- She left me because
I didn't make enough money.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.505
Beat the hell outta that ball
for the both of us, kid.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.341
She left him
for a variety
of reasons.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.276
You're doing great.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.378
But mostly the money
and ignore him.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.347
He doesn't know what the hell
he's talking about.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.615
I don't care
what you think.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.284
That's it,
you're fired.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.618
What?!

16:29.488 --> 16:32.256
- Think about
what you're doing, son.
- Oh, I have thought about it.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.258
I thought about it
all afternoon lying facedown

16:34.260 --> 16:36.627
On a sticky prison floor
worrying about my virginity.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.563
That's it,
you're outta here!

16:38.565 --> 16:41.366
You're making
a big mistake!

16:41.368 --> 16:45.236
- ( team oohs )
-  <i>ah, shut up!</i>

16:45.238 --> 16:47.472
What, you think
I'm the first guy
to fire his dad

16:47.474 --> 16:49.340
In front of a crowd
at a baseball game?

16:50.509 --> 16:53.344
Lou gehrig did it
in 1938.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.547
And his dad had
"lou gehrig's dad's disease."

16:56.549 --> 16:58.416
Look it up, people.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.254
All right,
before we start...

17:03.256 --> 17:06.290
Last session
was an anomaly.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.659
I became
uncharacteristically
vulnerable

17:08.661 --> 17:10.628
And I want to thank you all

17:10.630 --> 17:12.430
For sharing
your personal stories

17:12.432 --> 17:16.334
That made me feel
not so alone.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.370
I still can't believe
you had a stutter
till you were 10.

17:19.372 --> 17:23.207
Yeah, that makes
my unibrow year
seem so trivial.

17:23.209 --> 17:26.344
But when it happens to you,
it's not trivial.

17:26.346 --> 17:30.048
And for a 13-year-old girl
with a giant eyebrow,

17:30.050 --> 17:33.184
It becomes
the most important thing
in the world.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.586
It was the thin,
hairy line

17:35.588 --> 17:38.389
That separated me
from the cool kids.

17:40.159 --> 17:42.460
I was just glad to find out
I wasn't the only one

17:42.462 --> 17:44.162
Who had his head shaved
for ringworm.

17:44.164 --> 17:47.432
I never should've
head butted my ferret.

17:47.434 --> 17:50.468
It's not an approved
training technique,
anyway.

17:50.470 --> 17:54.238
I was really just
using my ringworm

17:54.240 --> 17:57.141
And stutter as examples
of how people

17:57.143 --> 17:59.277
Can develop anger
through being stigmatized.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.678
Oh, please.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.347
We're supposed to open up
because you were an ugly,

18:03.349 --> 18:04.582
Bald-headed little girl

18:04.584 --> 18:07.285
Who took an hour
to finish a sentence?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.787
Ed, why would you do that?

18:09.789 --> 18:13.324
I was being nothing
but honest and--

18:13.326 --> 18:16.094
Tissues, please.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.728
Oh, geez.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.564
Please, don't--

18:19.566 --> 18:22.500
I should be
easier on you.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.469
After all, I had...

18:24.471 --> 18:27.438
Problems when
I was a kid, too.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.307
Go on.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.509
I would wet the bed

18:31.511 --> 18:34.779
And my mama would hang
the sheets out the window

18:34.781 --> 18:37.115
For everybody to see.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.584
And then I got on
the internet

18:39.586 --> 18:42.620
And did a search
and found out that
your daddy

18:42.622 --> 18:44.522
Is alive and well

18:44.524 --> 18:47.158
And living in
northbrook, illinois.

18:48.327 --> 18:49.861
You are a liar,

18:49.863 --> 18:52.797
( stuttering )
dr. Ringworm.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.569
Okay, busted.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.673
I realized I can come off
as a bit aloof,

19:02.675 --> 19:05.610
So I thought by exaggerating
my personal narrative,

19:05.612 --> 19:07.512
I could get you to open up

19:07.514 --> 19:09.514
And we could make
some significant progress.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.648
And we did.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.551
You are one
twisted individual.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.387
You have no idea.

19:18.590 --> 19:21.392
Hey, charlie.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.528
I forgot my jacket.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.465
You want a hand?

19:27.467 --> 19:29.534
Thought I fired you.

19:29.536 --> 19:33.437
I may not be
your assistant anymore,
but I'm still your dad.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.876
What happened?
Car wouldn't start?

19:38.878 --> 19:40.511
Nope.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.580
Battery's dead.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.416
Did you try yelling at it,
get it all fired up?

19:47.486 --> 19:49.820
No, but I did hug it.
That didn't work either.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.324
Thanks.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.929
Tough loss, huh?

19:59.498 --> 20:01.299
Yup.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.434
But I'm proud
of those kids.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.636
Nobody lost their temper,
nobody went crazy.

20:07.573 --> 20:08.773
Just a game.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.509
I'm not just talking
about the game.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.577
I'm talking about
your life.

20:12.579 --> 20:15.580
You could've stayed
in baseball.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.981
Oh, sure.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.649
There's tons of teams
looking for an old ballplayer

20:18.651 --> 20:20.351
With a bad knee.

20:20.353 --> 20:23.487
The "l.A. Codgers."

20:23.489 --> 20:25.890
The "oakland pathetics."

20:25.892 --> 20:28.326
I mean, as a coach.

20:28.328 --> 20:32.763
Hell, pick up
the phone and call
one of your old buddies.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.666
Those kids really wanted
to play for you.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.435
That's a sign
of a real coach.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.904
This may come as
a shock to you,

20:39.906 --> 20:43.541
But I don't wanna
go back to baseball.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.843
I like what I do.
I help people.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.778
Helping people
makes you happy?

20:47.780 --> 20:50.848
Yeah.
Yeah, it does.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.284
Wow.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.588
By the way,
do you have auto club?

20:57.590 --> 20:58.823
I do, why?

20:58.825 --> 21:01.425
Your tires got slashed.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.027
I think it was
that logan kid.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.696
Could've been
the parents.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.531
Nah, it was logan.

21:07.533 --> 21:11.035
I stood with the parents
and watched him do it.
