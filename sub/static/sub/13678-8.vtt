00:01.378 --> 00:03.713
<i>Every relationship's
a power struggle.</i>

00:03.797 --> 00:05.298
<i>Some of us need
to be controlled.</i>

00:05.382 --> 00:06.966
Why did you first
start listening to me?

00:07.050 --> 00:08.677
I just followed
your lead.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.969
I don't want to
be a leader.

00:10.261 --> 00:13.014
I want my position
moved to the Risk
Management Department.

00:13.098 --> 00:16.101
If we pull milestone cases
like Washington Township...

00:16.184 --> 00:17.686
There's not much
we can do here today.

00:17.769 --> 00:19.688
<i>Closing the plant
is not an option.</i>

00:19.771 --> 00:22.273
I'm being pressured to resign.
You're not doing
anything to help.

00:22.399 --> 00:24.484
What did you
say your name was?
I'm Ollie.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.152
This is a Rubber Ducky.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.696
It'll pull all
cached passwords.

00:27.779 --> 00:30.907
<i>We can get every e-mail,
text message and document.</i>

00:30.990 --> 00:32.158
You guys just got hacked.

00:33.618 --> 00:35.578
<i>Jesus, what is that noise?</i>

00:35.662 --> 00:37.038
Tape's busted.
Grab another one.

00:37.122 --> 00:39.874
All of you can't
accept the fact
that maybe we fucked up.

00:39.958 --> 00:42.460
<i>Who knows who's
gonna be waiting
for you at home?</i>

00:42.544 --> 00:44.003
<i>Dark Army, FBI, cops.</i>

00:44.087 --> 00:46.715
He hacked me and
stole my dog on top of it.

00:46.798 --> 00:47.841
That proves it was him.

00:48.383 --> 00:49.676
<i>Where do you think
you are right now?</i>

00:49.801 --> 00:52.095
What do you mean?
You haven't been
staying with your mother.

00:56.683 --> 00:59.060
<i>People always
told me growing up</i>

00:59.144 --> 01:01.104
<i>that it's never
about the destination.</i>

01:03.940 --> 01:05.525
<i>It's about the journey.</i>

01:07.152 --> 01:10.864
<i>But what if
the destination is you?</i>

01:10.947 --> 01:12.657
Elliot Alderson.

01:12.741 --> 01:14.743
Are you Elliot Alderson?

01:16.453 --> 01:18.413
Mr. Alderson,
you're under arrest

01:18.496 --> 01:20.081
for unauthorized use
of a computer,

01:20.165 --> 01:22.417
computer trespass,
and grand larceny.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.377
Grab the computers.
Let's go.

01:24.461 --> 01:27.046
Get the hard drives.
All the USB drives.

01:27.505 --> 01:29.132
- Any digital media.
- Yes, sir.

01:29.215 --> 01:31.050
What are these over here?
Check everywhere.

01:33.595 --> 01:35.180
Get animal control here
for the dog.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.140
Let's go. Let's go.

01:40.643 --> 01:42.979
Put your arms up.
Spread them.

01:52.614 --> 01:53.656
Put your left thumb
on there.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.245
You suicidal?

01:59.370 --> 02:00.705
No.

02:01.331 --> 02:02.707
You a drug addict?

02:03.374 --> 02:04.459
No.

02:06.836 --> 02:08.213
You on any medication?

02:08.588 --> 02:09.672
No.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.300
How you feeling right now?

02:12.550 --> 02:13.760
Great.

02:16.471 --> 02:19.432
I've spoken with the
prosecutor and we can get
the hacking charges reduced.

02:19.516 --> 02:22.560
The theft charge
is a little more difficult.

02:23.102 --> 02:24.771
The plaintiff is really
upset about the dog,

02:24.854 --> 02:26.648
but I think
we can negotiate.

02:29.359 --> 02:31.528
Hey, you heard
what I said, right?

02:32.362 --> 02:38.493
When the judge asks you
for a plea you say,
"Not guilty."

02:39.327 --> 02:40.537
Got it?

02:44.415 --> 02:47.544
In the case of
<i>People v. Alderson,</i>
how does the defendant plead?

02:55.885 --> 02:56.928
Guilty.

02:59.055 --> 03:00.682
Are you serious?
You're shitting me.

03:01.474 --> 03:05.937
<i>Mr. Alderson, you do realize
Mr. Lenny Shannon's dog</i>

03:06.020 --> 03:09.190
<i>was an expensive purchase
at $1,200?</i>

03:09.274 --> 03:11.109
<i>That makes your theft
a felony.</i>

03:18.199 --> 03:19.659
<i>Let the record show,</i>

03:20.285 --> 03:23.538
<i>Mr. Alderson nodded his head
up and down indicating, "Yes."</i>

03:23.746 --> 03:26.666
<i>And you're admitting
you hacked into
Mr. Shannon's email,</i>

03:26.749 --> 03:28.710
<i>social media,
and bank accounts,</i>

03:28.793 --> 03:31.754
<i>which would convict you
on both counts
of computer hacking?</i>

03:37.635 --> 03:39.178
<i>Again, let the record show,</i>

03:39.262 --> 03:43.057
Mr. Alderson nodded his head
up and down indicating, "Yes."

03:43.141 --> 03:45.268
<i>You're aware of the gravity
of these allegations?</i>

03:45.351 --> 03:47.353
<i>You will be
sentenced to jail.</i>

03:47.437 --> 03:49.480
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

03:51.190 --> 03:52.400
Yes.

03:53.985 --> 03:55.486
And I plead guilty.

03:55.570 --> 03:58.197
<i>Do you make this plea
out of free will
and free mind?</i>

03:58.281 --> 03:59.741
<i>No! No.
He's fucking crazy.</i>

04:01.784 --> 04:02.911
Yes.

04:06.748 --> 04:09.042
Mr. Alderson,
I declare you guilty

04:09.125 --> 04:11.252
of computer hacking,
computer trespass,

04:11.336 --> 04:13.004
grand larceny
of fourth degree.

04:13.087 --> 04:16.424
I hereby sentence you
to 18 months in county jail.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.468
<i>Adi√≥s,</i>
you son of a bitch.

04:26.768 --> 04:28.061
This your first time
here?

04:28.603 --> 04:29.896
Yes.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.398
Do you have any intention
of harming yourself?

04:32.482 --> 04:33.900
- No.
- Sit.

04:35.944 --> 04:36.986
Don't move.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.656
Put your chin
on the bull's-eye.

04:41.157 --> 04:42.575
Do not move.

04:43.993 --> 04:45.036
Right side.

04:52.502 --> 04:53.544
All right, let's go.

05:02.428 --> 05:04.305
Need you to swing by
at 3:00 PM.

05:07.392 --> 05:09.018
Problems with RT again.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.728
Yes, sir, Warden.

05:18.236 --> 05:19.570
Let's go. Get naked.

05:33.334 --> 05:36.004
Let's go.
Get undressed. Hurry up.
All right, let's go.

05:36.087 --> 05:37.296
Get undressed for me.

05:39.549 --> 05:41.426
Squat down. Turn around.

05:41.551 --> 05:43.219
Want to see
the bottoms of your feet.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.346
Your left foot.
Now bend over.
Spread your ass.

05:45.430 --> 05:47.098
Bend over. Spread them.

05:53.646 --> 05:56.149
Read this right here,
confirm that these
are all of your items,

05:56.232 --> 05:57.275
and sign right here.

05:58.776 --> 06:00.236
Speedy Gonzales.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.113
Fucking amazing, man.

06:02.196 --> 06:06.284
Arrested, arraigned,
convicted within 24 hours.

06:07.410 --> 06:09.120
Yeah, we heard
about you, cuz.

06:10.246 --> 06:14.250
In fact,
you're the only guilty man
in the entire pen.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.668
You know that?

06:16.502 --> 06:17.587
Leon.

06:18.963 --> 06:20.381
Okay, that's cool.

06:21.174 --> 06:22.216
It's best you learn soon,

06:22.300 --> 06:24.927
'cause you
don't wanna be alone
in a place like this.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.138
Check it out.
I'll give you the lowdown.

06:27.597 --> 06:29.766
Routine. That's key.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.642
It's best you
find your routine,

06:31.726 --> 06:33.644
whatever it is,
and stick to it.

06:33.728 --> 06:35.229
Mornings, we chow.

06:35.313 --> 06:37.815
Afternoons,
we hit the ball court.

06:37.899 --> 06:40.276
Evenings,
that's when I get my TV time.

06:41.444 --> 06:44.280
Some people
join church groups,
or AA, or whatever,

06:44.363 --> 06:46.449
but I like to bench,
personally.

06:47.116 --> 06:48.785
Peace, brother.
'Sup, bro?

06:50.578 --> 06:52.622
Ain't no Internet
for us here.

06:52.705 --> 06:56.042
Your best bet
is going through some
boxes in the library

06:56.125 --> 06:58.836
full of old,
throwback classic DVDs.

06:59.128 --> 07:00.379
You know what I'm saying?

07:00.755 --> 07:03.591
I'm making my way
through the '90s right now.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.927
Nearly finished
with <i>Mad About You.</i>

07:07.386 --> 07:11.808
You know, my man Paul Reiser,
he just doesn't get
the credit he deserve.

07:11.891 --> 07:14.102
Man is spectacular.

07:14.185 --> 07:15.603
Phenomenal.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.898
Think I'm gonna start
watching <i>Seinfeld</i> next.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.399
I heard it's nails.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.113
You look nervous, cuz.

07:26.072 --> 07:27.323
Don't be.

07:28.449 --> 07:29.867
Just do you.

07:30.535 --> 07:34.330
I mean, I'd say we got
a pretty solid rapport
going on anyway.

07:34.705 --> 07:37.708
We stick together,
things will be just fine.

07:41.838 --> 07:43.172
Oh, that's Hot Carla.

07:43.548 --> 07:47.552
If you're a pyro,
she's your chick
with a dick.

07:48.344 --> 07:49.846
Know what I'm saying?

07:50.304 --> 07:51.764
Probably not.

07:57.395 --> 07:58.437
Oh.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.064
Whatever you do,

08:01.440 --> 08:05.403
stay away from these
David Duke motherfuckers
right here, man.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.035
You don't say much,
do you?

08:15.037 --> 08:16.330
No.

08:16.414 --> 08:17.874
Well, that's cool, man.

08:18.249 --> 08:20.585
I'm here to provide you
with anything you may need.

08:21.586 --> 08:24.755
I can pretty
much find anything,
and I mean anything.

08:25.173 --> 08:31.179
Smokes, pills, hard shit,
porn, grandma porn.

08:32.889 --> 08:35.933
Some of these guys
like that shit. Gay porn.

08:36.392 --> 08:37.602
I don't judge, man.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.020
Whatever you need.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.070
Can you get me a notebook?

09:12.428 --> 09:14.096
See you in the morning.

09:31.322 --> 09:33.074
<i>That's how it happened.</i>

09:33.157 --> 09:34.909
<i>That's all you missed.</i>

09:34.992 --> 09:36.494
<i>That's everything.</i>

09:46.796 --> 09:48.172
You got everything
you arrived with?

09:52.677 --> 09:54.136
Sign here stating such.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.689
Here's a discharge report
and the early release form.

10:05.523 --> 10:07.024
Give that to
the officers at the door.

10:11.529 --> 10:13.030
You have the hack
to thank for that letter.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.659
I never released this many
nonviolent offenders before.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.454
This mess with the economy
is affecting
the prison budgets, too.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.291
You got lucky.
Don't squander it.

10:29.505 --> 10:30.881
That card's worthless
out there now.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.718
You want it for
sentimental value,
or should I toss it?

10:35.511 --> 10:36.554
Toss it.

10:40.516 --> 10:42.727
<i>Init 5,
return to normal.</i>

10:48.232 --> 10:52.361
<i>Is it possible to return
after 86 days
in a 6x9-foot box?</i>

11:23.017 --> 11:25.603
<i>Init 5 is supposed
to bring color and sound.</i>

11:29.273 --> 11:31.400
<i>Instead
the world's gray and quiet.</i>

12:37.216 --> 12:39.343
Joseph Green's office.
Monica speaking.

12:39.468 --> 12:40.469
<i>Hi, Monica.</i>

12:40.553 --> 12:43.139
<i>I'm a junior partner
at Johnson, Lerner,
and Carlin.</i>

12:43.222 --> 12:47.476
<i>I have sensitive documents
for Mr. Green regarding
this Flint water case.</i>

12:47.560 --> 12:49.687
Send them over.
I'll make sure
he gets them right away.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.189
<i>I'm actually
downstairs right now.</i>

12:52.857 --> 12:54.650
Super. Leave them
at reception.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.695
<i>I'm sorry.
I was told these are
very sensitive documents</i>

12:57.820 --> 13:01.574
<i>and to only deliver
them straight to Mr. Green
or your hands.</i>

13:02.158 --> 13:06.370
Sorry. I can't leave my desk,
but Mr. Green is out
of the office until 2:00,

13:06.495 --> 13:08.706
so he's not gonna read them
right away anyway.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.332
<i>Obviously I would just
bring them up myself,</i>

13:10.499 --> 13:11.959
<i>but security
down here is insane.</i>

13:12.042 --> 13:13.878
<i>Can you please
just come down?</i>

13:17.047 --> 13:19.091
Okay, I'll be right down.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.138
Oh, hey.

14:13.729 --> 14:14.939
Monica.

14:17.775 --> 14:20.152
Uh, tell Joe to give me a call
when he gets back
from lunch, will you?

14:22.112 --> 14:23.280
Sure.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.983
She on it?
Sure.

14:59.358 --> 15:00.943
We started it last week.

16:21.732 --> 16:22.941
Hurry up.

16:26.070 --> 16:27.696
I hacked
my Dark Army contact.

16:27.780 --> 16:31.158
Found an archive
with screenshots
of his IRC chats with them.

16:31.241 --> 16:35.079
Something called Stage 2.
It has something to
do with the femtocell.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.246
I tried to tell
Trenton and Mobley,

16:36.330 --> 16:38.248
but I couldn't get in touch
with either of them.

16:38.332 --> 16:40.668
I called, messaged,
checked all the usual haunts.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.670
Both are AWOL.

16:42.753 --> 16:44.672
Okay, Trenton's
parents are a wreck.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.175
They filed
a missing person's report.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.387
Between them missing
and the channel archive,

16:51.470 --> 16:53.180
I'm freaking out.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.016
I think Dark Army
could be cleaning house.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.601
That doesn't make sense.

16:58.102 --> 16:59.687
I think they're
behind my early release.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.940
We need to talk
to your contact.

17:05.776 --> 17:08.946
We're not really
on the best of terms
right now.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.824
Doesn't matter.
They can't do this.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.119
This wasn't part of the deal.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.457
Let's keep moving.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.798
Out through the basement,
I'll leave
through the side door,

17:27.881 --> 17:29.007
and we'll meet
at the seven.

17:29.133 --> 17:30.217
Not yet.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.553
I'm going to see her.

17:34.388 --> 17:37.182
What do you mean?
I thought this was
just to lose our tail.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.060
Elliot, you're
actually gonna go see her?

17:41.729 --> 17:43.480
We seriously need to talk.

17:43.564 --> 17:44.648
Shit has gone down.

17:44.732 --> 17:46.483
I need to do this.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.488
Okay.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.825
Okay, just be quick.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.410
I'll wait
in the stairwell.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.177
Mom?

18:24.521 --> 18:25.731
They taking care of you?

18:28.192 --> 18:29.401
Room looks nice.

18:33.363 --> 18:36.909
I'll see if they
can fix the clock.
Looks like it's broken.

18:41.538 --> 18:42.790
How are you?

18:51.548 --> 18:54.968
A lot's happened
since last I saw you.

18:56.053 --> 18:57.554
Had a really hard time.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.894
Anyway, just wanted
to say thank you.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.818
You helped me survive
these last couple months.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.906
I don't think I could have
done it without you.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.296
Okay.

19:40.097 --> 19:41.431
Take care.

19:55.696 --> 19:56.780
He's been released.

19:57.781 --> 19:58.824
Hmm.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.451
Not yet.

20:04.997 --> 20:06.039
But we'll be late.

20:06.540 --> 20:07.624
This is important.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.631
Do you know who this is?

20:16.884 --> 20:24.057
The previous CEO of E Corp.
Served from 1986 until
his death in 1995.

20:25.976 --> 20:31.148
Do you know how it came
to be that he lies two
meters below our feet?

20:32.399 --> 20:33.567
A plane accident, I believe.

20:35.986 --> 20:37.529
What have I told you
about using that word?

20:39.990 --> 20:41.992
A plane crash.
What is the significance?

20:43.285 --> 20:47.581
In the wake of a scandal,
he was going to shut down
my project.

20:49.207 --> 20:52.794
Instead, he's where he should
be and my project was kept
alive.

21:07.142 --> 21:09.728
I'm feeling inclined to take
the same action now that I did
then.

21:12.773 --> 21:15.442
<i>Init 5 is
supposed to be simple.</i>

21:15.525 --> 21:17.194
<i>A fresh start.</i>

21:17.277 --> 21:19.071
<i>Restored connections.</i>

21:20.530 --> 21:23.367
<i>This may be my first
real moment of normalcy.</i>

21:24.201 --> 21:25.535
<i>Taking a piss in private.</i>

21:25.911 --> 21:28.872
You hit me in the face
with a fucking bat!

21:28.956 --> 21:30.666
Thank God I didn't need
stitches!

21:30.749 --> 21:32.334
Well, I should have
hit you harder.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.711
Dear God,
we've been over this
for the last three weeks.

21:34.795 --> 21:36.588
Okay, I've walked you through
every IRC conversation.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.299
I am not gonna let this go.

21:39.383 --> 21:41.635
Why the fuck are you
sending pictures of me
while I'm asleep

21:41.718 --> 21:42.761
to the Dark Army?

21:42.844 --> 21:44.554
How many times
do I have to tell you?

21:44.638 --> 21:46.348
Letting them
know you're with me
keeps you safe.

21:46.431 --> 21:47.474
I was trying to protect you.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.893
Then why aren't you
telling me about Stage 2

21:49.977 --> 21:51.395
and what you guys
did with the femtocell?

21:51.478 --> 21:52.938
We've been over
this a million...

21:53.021 --> 21:54.982
You've both got to calm down!

21:59.903 --> 22:02.906
Yes, the shit has
officially hit the fan.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.574
Here's what we're gonna do.

22:06.660 --> 22:09.454
Okay, okay.
Let's all take a beat.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.836
We're gonna
settle down here. Relax...

22:18.255 --> 22:19.297
Elliot?

22:24.594 --> 22:26.555
Hey, Elliot.
You all right?

22:32.853 --> 22:34.062
Elliot?

22:34.396 --> 22:35.814
Come back to Earth.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.484
I thought you wanted to find
Mobley and Trenton?

22:46.783 --> 22:47.868
Yeah.

22:48.785 --> 22:49.870
Yeah.

22:52.622 --> 22:54.875
We need to know
what happened to them,
right?

22:56.960 --> 22:58.336
I can't keep up
with you two.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.880
Look, I'm not risking
my life to help with this.

22:59.963 --> 23:00.964
I'm not doing it.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.299
- I'm not doing it.
- Your Dark Army contact.

23:02.758 --> 23:04.843
You have one? You must.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.517
If they find out
I was involved,
it'll be my ass.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.062
Okay? I'll be
the next one missing.

23:15.145 --> 23:17.856
Only there won't be
any questions
about where I went.

23:24.071 --> 23:25.906
You better be more
reliable than your sister.

23:38.543 --> 23:41.213
Hey, what the hell
just happened?

23:42.589 --> 23:44.174
I was gonna
ask you the same.

23:47.344 --> 23:48.804
Why were you
talking with them?

23:50.305 --> 23:51.640
What are you
talking about?

23:52.933 --> 23:54.434
One second,
everything was normal.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.645
All of a sudden,
you stopped responding.

23:57.395 --> 23:58.688
It was like you shut down.

23:59.064 --> 24:00.482
I had to say something.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.780
It's unfortunate
what both your country

24:06.863 --> 24:09.866
and the company
have been through
in the last several weeks.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.078
Yes.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.623
A succession of
unfortunate events.

24:17.666 --> 24:19.626
The timing of which
almost seems intentional.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.546
Well,
at least there's good news
for both of us.

24:23.213 --> 24:27.843
Your little pet project
came through even better
than you thought.

24:29.136 --> 24:31.138
I must admit,
she surprised me.

24:32.013 --> 24:35.058
It's a good thing that
she did the right thing
in the end.

24:36.393 --> 24:40.230
It's too bad.
You know, for all she's done,
it won't matter.

24:41.064 --> 24:42.566
The failure of
the bailout has left me

24:42.649 --> 24:44.401
in a rather
obsequious position.

24:44.734 --> 24:47.320
We failed our
financial stress test,

24:48.029 --> 24:51.074
so we won't be able
to keep up
all our facilities.

24:55.662 --> 24:59.499
As of noon this Friday,
I'm sorry to say,

24:59.958 --> 25:04.546
the Washington Township plant
will be taken over by
the federal government.

25:07.757 --> 25:09.843
And here I thought we were
taking a step forward,

25:11.136 --> 25:13.346
but here we stand
two steps back.

25:14.806 --> 25:17.434
Your actions remind me
of your predecessor,
Phillip.

25:18.643 --> 25:21.813
And here comes
the veiled death threat.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.567
You wanna take
a shot at me?

25:26.860 --> 25:28.236
Be my guest.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.281
The appointment
of a new CEO

25:31.364 --> 25:35.035
isn't going to stop
the federal government
from taking over the plant.

25:38.455 --> 25:41.291
I flew for 13 hours
and 35 minutes.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.668
If you have a point,
it's time.

25:45.503 --> 25:49.341
I needed that bailout money,
and I no longer have it,

25:49.925 --> 25:51.760
thanks to your
little shootout in China.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.428
What do I need now?

25:54.763 --> 25:55.889
Cash.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.391
Lots of it.

25:59.809 --> 26:02.562
I could see a scenario
where the Chinese government,

26:02.646 --> 26:07.734
in a bid to establish itself
as the new global leader
of the 21st century,

26:08.276 --> 26:10.362
loans E Corp
the money it needs.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.658
At a low interest rate.

26:16.368 --> 26:18.036
Perhaps even zero.

26:19.537 --> 26:22.040
As a gesture of goodwill
to the American people.

26:22.958 --> 26:25.210
With that cash,
I could save your plant

26:25.293 --> 26:28.755
from the clutches of
the federal government,
and finally,

26:29.589 --> 26:33.843
when a peaceful China
appears benevolent, well...

26:35.971 --> 26:40.016
That's an easier pitch
for me to get onto
the President's desk.

26:42.602 --> 26:45.855
I will be happy
to go back and talk
with the Chinese government.

26:46.106 --> 26:48.733
I'm sure that they
will be most agreeable,

26:49.025 --> 26:50.735
but the next time you
threaten my plant...

26:50.944 --> 26:52.153
What?

26:52.779 --> 26:53.905
What?

26:56.992 --> 26:59.577
The only move
left in that scenario
is a third World War.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.580
You see? I'm a mercenary.

27:03.707 --> 27:05.292
I don't play fair.

27:05.583 --> 27:06.793
I play what I want.

27:08.336 --> 27:09.546
When you deal
with a mercenary,

27:09.629 --> 27:11.840
then all decorum
gets tossed out the window,

27:11.923 --> 27:16.303
so you go ahead
with your cute threats
and your watch beeps.

27:16.886 --> 27:21.057
Order will not protect you
anymore, my friend.

27:21.308 --> 27:23.601
I will rain chaos,

27:25.687 --> 27:26.980
even if it hurts me,

27:29.816 --> 27:34.112
'cause I would
rather see you lose
than win myself.

27:38.325 --> 27:39.367
Ah.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.621
That's all the time I have.

27:46.499 --> 27:49.878
<i>On May 9th,
we took down the world's
biggest conglomerate.</i>

27:50.712 --> 27:52.422
<i>We all had
the same intention,</i>

27:52.756 --> 27:56.259
<i>me, Darlene, Mobley,
Trenton, Romero,</i>

27:56.926 --> 28:00.305
<i>to change the world,
but there was
one other player,</i>

28:00.388 --> 28:01.848
<i>the Dark Army.</i>

28:02.182 --> 28:04.976
<i>We never did find out
what their intentions were.</i>

28:07.937 --> 28:09.731
<i>Pwnie Express pwn phone.</i>

28:10.065 --> 28:14.194
<i>A phone loaded
with 103 network monitoring
and attack tools.</i>

28:14.402 --> 28:16.905
<i>A dream device for
pentesters and hackers.</i>

28:18.239 --> 28:19.699
<i>His name is Xun.</i>

28:20.158 --> 28:23.161
<i>Xun's boss is Whiterose,
who helped us
bring down Evil Corp.</i>

28:24.454 --> 28:26.873
<i>Xun and his people
wanted the femtocell.</i>

28:27.082 --> 28:28.124
<i>Why?</i>

28:28.333 --> 28:31.669
<i>I don't know, but soon
we'll know everything.</i>

28:32.295 --> 28:33.380
<i>We're hacking Xun.</i>

28:34.964 --> 28:36.383
Something's not right.

28:38.593 --> 28:39.886
I feel off.

28:41.054 --> 28:42.514
It's like we're overheating.

28:46.226 --> 28:47.352
We'll be fine.

28:49.521 --> 28:51.106
We're up.
I've got a connection.

28:55.693 --> 28:57.195
Time to set
the meet with Xun.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.907
Wait, wait. No, no, no.
I thought we were
operating from here?

29:01.616 --> 29:02.992
This only gets
his phone mic live.

29:03.827 --> 29:05.453
I'm going to ask him
about Stage 2.

29:05.537 --> 29:06.579
What?

29:07.038 --> 29:08.706
Even if they don't
tell me anything,

29:08.790 --> 29:10.250
at least it'll get them
talking about it,

29:11.251 --> 29:12.669
and that's all
we need right now.
Oh, my God.

29:13.294 --> 29:15.255
Jesus, bro,
you're just like
your sister.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.006
First the number,
now the meet.

29:17.090 --> 29:19.175
I mean, you don't stop.
I'm not doing it, man.

29:19.259 --> 29:22.220
These guys won't
think twice about
killing you on the spot.

29:26.141 --> 29:27.267
Trust me.

29:28.101 --> 29:29.686
I have a way
to get him talking.

29:30.019 --> 29:32.272
Fuck, yeah.
I would love to meet him.

29:32.397 --> 29:34.691
No, he's not meeting you.
He's meeting Mr. Robot.

29:39.279 --> 29:40.613
What'd you say?

29:43.283 --> 29:44.534
Nothing.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.244
I meant me.

29:48.079 --> 29:49.497
Me. He's meeting me.

29:52.041 --> 29:53.668
Something's happening
with us.

29:55.295 --> 29:56.546
We can't do this.

29:58.756 --> 30:00.008
I got this.

30:18.193 --> 30:19.819
This is big.

30:21.488 --> 30:22.697
How did you get...

30:22.780 --> 30:24.616
The levels of
toxicity are still

30:24.699 --> 30:27.911
above regulation, right?

30:33.500 --> 30:35.752
What's the next
course of action
in a case like this?

30:38.129 --> 30:40.423
Uh, well, this definitely
falls under what we call

30:40.507 --> 30:44.093
substantial and
specific danger
to public health and safety.

30:45.512 --> 30:48.515
You know we're bound by law
to protect your anonymity,
right?

30:49.766 --> 30:52.644
There could be money
for a whistle-blower
in a situation like this.

30:54.604 --> 30:55.772
You're gonna
wanna get a lawyer.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.190
I'm not doing this
for the money.

30:58.316 --> 30:59.776
I just want it
to happen fast.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.446
Okay.

31:04.322 --> 31:05.782
I'll take this
to the deputy director.

31:06.783 --> 31:08.201
You mind sticking around
for a while?

31:08.576 --> 31:09.661
No.

32:27.614 --> 32:28.656
Hey!

32:39.709 --> 32:40.752
Hey!

32:41.294 --> 32:42.337
Hey!

32:43.421 --> 32:45.048
All right, yo.
This is our stop.

32:49.636 --> 32:51.137
Yo, I don't get it.
Are you nervous
or something, man?

32:51.220 --> 32:52.597
Because you can't be...
No, I...

32:53.806 --> 32:55.808
Never mind. I'm good.

33:03.066 --> 33:04.442
She looked at me
from head to toe.

33:04.734 --> 33:10.448
In the hotel room, that bitch
was ready to ride me.

33:11.366 --> 33:13.618
Then I saw her feet.

33:14.410 --> 33:16.204
Fucking strange.

33:16.663 --> 33:20.333
All five toes exactly
the same length.

33:20.625 --> 33:22.377
I couldn't handle it.

33:23.294 --> 33:24.796
No matter how hot she is...

33:25.004 --> 33:29.092
<i>Flying drones into the capital
of this great nation.</i>

33:29.175 --> 33:34.055
<i>Meanwhile, the FBI
gets caught with its hand
in the cookie jar</i>

33:34.138 --> 33:36.933
<i>trying to work in
legal gray areas,</i>

33:37.058 --> 33:39.894
<i>listening in on phone calls,
reading emails.</i>

33:39.977 --> 33:42.772
<i>The FBI has 3 million
of you innocent citizens</i>

33:42.855 --> 33:45.066
<i>under surveillance
for no reason.</i>

33:45.525 --> 33:47.777
<i>Okay? The backlash?</i>

33:47.860 --> 33:49.362
<i>It boggles the mind.</i>

33:49.779 --> 33:51.614
<i>If you've got
nothing to hide,</i>

33:51.698 --> 33:53.449
<i>then what do you
have to worry about?</i>

33:53.533 --> 33:55.493
<i>Especially,
of a little surveillance?</i>

33:56.202 --> 33:59.706
Shit.
<i>Help bring down
the world's worst criminal.</i>

33:59.789 --> 34:04.836
<i>The FBI needs
to catch this guy
by whatever means necessary.</i>

34:06.838 --> 34:08.673
<i>Symbol of capitalism.</i>

34:08.756 --> 34:14.387
<i>Unless it falls
on the capital's doorstep,
that's not vandalism.</i>

34:14.470 --> 34:16.681
<i>That's a victory lap,
people!</i>

34:16.931 --> 34:20.226
<i>Tyrell Wellick
wants us to know,
he's not done yet...</i>

34:48.838 --> 34:50.798
What the fuck is going on?

34:51.758 --> 34:53.384
He said he wants to see you.

35:01.434 --> 35:04.312
Fuck it, let's go!

35:09.567 --> 35:10.651
Why are they
leaving?

35:10.735 --> 35:12.987
They weren't
expecting you.

35:14.405 --> 35:15.448
Look at me!

35:24.582 --> 35:28.753
Tell Whiterose I wanna know
what Stage 2 is.

36:08.125 --> 36:09.919
Second one tonight.

36:11.379 --> 36:13.256
Brownouts.
We've been bracing ourselves

36:13.339 --> 36:15.716
since Comet Electric
went on strike.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.886
I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.
Deputy Director Phelps.

36:18.970 --> 36:21.138
Office of Investigations.
Hi.

36:21.889 --> 36:24.058
Jeff told me a little about
what you've brought us.

36:24.892 --> 36:26.686
Can you come with me?

36:28.646 --> 36:31.691
My colleagues and I want to
ask you a few questions.

36:31.774 --> 36:34.485
We're so indebted
to citizens like you.

36:35.820 --> 36:36.863
Thank you.

36:37.071 --> 36:38.656
I never cease
to be astonished

36:38.739 --> 36:40.533
by the heroics
of everyday people.

36:42.785 --> 36:45.162
Did you come all the way
down from New York
just for this?

36:46.414 --> 36:48.124
Or are you
based in New Jersey?

36:49.333 --> 36:50.585
You know,
I should probably get

36:50.668 --> 36:52.169
some contact
information from you.

36:54.130 --> 36:55.464
Jeff promised anonymity.

36:55.548 --> 36:58.259
Which is a nice idea,
to be sure.

36:59.176 --> 37:00.511
Is Jeff going to
be in the meeting?

37:00.595 --> 37:03.264
I know.
It sounds complicated,
but how it works is,

37:03.347 --> 37:05.349
the commission will want to
discuss this with you

37:05.433 --> 37:06.684
after they review.

37:08.477 --> 37:10.187
Maybe I'm misunderstanding,
but...

37:10.271 --> 37:12.648
You do work at E Corp, yes?

37:15.568 --> 37:16.736
What?

37:19.030 --> 37:20.281
I never said that.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.450
What is your position there?

37:22.867 --> 37:24.911
The more we know
about the origins
of these documents,

37:24.994 --> 37:26.537
the quicker
we can process them.

37:31.751 --> 37:34.128
Actually, could I get
my files and the drive back?

37:34.462 --> 37:36.130
You've made it
all the way down here.

37:37.048 --> 37:38.341
Let's not stop now,
shall we?

37:38.424 --> 37:39.467
I'm sorry.

37:40.384 --> 37:42.762
This trip has
taken a lot longer
than I thought it would,

37:44.430 --> 37:46.265
and I can't miss
the last train back.

37:46.557 --> 37:49.477
But, Angela, my colleagues
in the other room are
eager to talk to you.

37:56.192 --> 37:57.568
No, thanks.

37:58.611 --> 37:59.987
I gotta go.

38:13.501 --> 38:14.752
How'd it go?

38:14.877 --> 38:16.087
Everything's on track.

38:16.837 --> 38:18.172
Good.

38:18.839 --> 38:20.383
The lights
have been flickering.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.969
Yeah.
The streetlights too.
Brownout's started.

38:23.052 --> 38:25.388
Hey. I gotta talk
to you for a minute.

38:27.890 --> 38:30.101
I left that busted VHS tape
at the Smart House.

38:30.559 --> 38:31.894
What VHS tape?

38:31.978 --> 38:33.270
That fsociety video.

38:34.105 --> 38:36.065
Relax.
I'm sure we got it.
We cleaned the place good.

38:36.148 --> 38:38.526
No, I left it.
It's not here.

38:38.609 --> 38:40.736
We wiped
the whole house down.

38:41.112 --> 38:42.405
Do you remember
grabbing it?

38:43.072 --> 38:44.615
I know I didn't.

38:46.158 --> 38:47.243
We have to go back.

38:47.326 --> 38:48.494
Oh, Jesus Christ,
Darlene.

38:48.577 --> 38:50.496
We cannot go back.
That was a goddamn
month ago.

38:50.579 --> 38:52.039
The cops could have
been there already.

38:52.123 --> 38:53.290
I mean, you're just
remembering this now?

38:53.416 --> 38:54.875
It doesn't matter.
I have to go.

38:54.959 --> 38:57.128
Fucking hell, Darlene.
I swear.

38:58.421 --> 39:00.756
Why are you even
using VHS tapes
in the first place?

39:01.090 --> 39:02.133
Because it's cool?

39:02.425 --> 39:03.884
There's a million
filters on Final Cut.

39:03.968 --> 39:05.970
My face is on that tape.

39:08.639 --> 39:11.517
Fine. Fine.
But I'm going, all right?

39:11.600 --> 39:13.477
Feds are looking
for you, not me.

39:13.686 --> 39:15.021
Where is it?

39:15.938 --> 39:19.859
I think I set it
on that weird lamp
in the living room.

39:20.109 --> 39:21.694
Maybe it fell behind.

39:21.986 --> 39:23.237
All right.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.488
Hang on.

39:26.198 --> 39:27.533
Thank you.

39:28.826 --> 39:29.994
Really.

39:47.470 --> 39:48.804
Hey, you look burnt.

39:53.184 --> 39:55.144
Yeah, I'm getting tired.

39:58.981 --> 40:00.858
You can stay here
and crash on the couch.

40:03.903 --> 40:05.196
Home would be better.

40:07.156 --> 40:08.574
I'm not feeling right.

40:09.742 --> 40:11.160
They're gonna be watching.

40:13.746 --> 40:15.206
All the more reason.

40:16.499 --> 40:18.584
I need them to see me
living a normal life.

40:20.836 --> 40:22.421
Good point.

40:22.922 --> 40:24.381
But assume the worst.

40:26.926 --> 40:28.594
Your place
is probably bugged.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.347
Be careful
coming back here.

40:31.889 --> 40:33.349
I'll stay up
and keep listening.

41:10.386 --> 41:12.930
Hey, one of your
fellow tenants
let me in the building.

41:13.931 --> 41:17.560
Look what I got.
Your favorite. Nia's gyros.
Mind if I come in?

41:19.395 --> 41:21.522
Actually, yeah. I'm...

41:21.605 --> 41:24.066
Don't worry.
I left my handcuffs at home.

41:28.112 --> 41:29.321
Wow.

41:30.072 --> 41:31.115
Gosh.

41:31.907 --> 41:33.242
Nice place.

41:34.577 --> 41:36.912
They really take
good care of you here, huh?

41:39.790 --> 41:40.916
E Corp housing?

41:57.099 --> 41:58.475
Are you
working for them?

42:02.605 --> 42:03.981
Working for who,
Angela?

42:07.484 --> 42:08.819
I need you to leave.

42:19.163 --> 42:24.168
I had this dream,
which if you know me,
is pretty rare.

42:25.711 --> 42:27.046
It was good at first.

42:28.297 --> 42:29.548
Exciting.

42:29.882 --> 42:31.383
There was this
beautiful woman.

42:33.219 --> 42:34.637
Sexy, even.

42:37.806 --> 42:39.558
But then, man,
did it go downhill fast.

42:41.852 --> 42:43.979
By the end, I was
being choked underwater.

42:55.491 --> 42:57.660
Ollie Parker told me
about the CD at Allsafe.

42:59.662 --> 43:01.413
It was literally
the first thing
out of his mouth

43:01.497 --> 43:03.165
when we interviewed
him two months ago.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.669
I've been having you
tracked ever since.

43:07.086 --> 43:08.587
Including your little
field trip out there

43:08.671 --> 43:11.006
to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission today.

43:12.508 --> 43:14.593
It's clear
you're freaking out
about something.

43:15.719 --> 43:17.680
I don't know how
any of this ties together,

43:19.223 --> 43:21.558
but eventually someone
will connect the dots,

43:21.850 --> 43:23.227
and it'll catch up to you.

43:25.771 --> 43:27.356
So I'm being real
with you right now.

43:29.692 --> 43:31.527
Next person's
not gonna offer you food.

43:32.528 --> 43:34.113
They're gonna grab
you off the street

43:34.196 --> 43:35.864
and throw you
in a dark cell.

43:43.372 --> 43:44.873
But you still have
one hand to play.

43:46.750 --> 43:48.085
That's me.

44:07.271 --> 44:11.608
In that dream I had,
when I was being drowned,

44:13.902 --> 44:15.404
it was when I
stopped fighting it,

44:17.072 --> 44:19.616
when I finally let go
and stopped
struggling so much...

44:22.161 --> 44:23.662
That's when I survived.

45:37.361 --> 45:38.779
He's been waiting for you.

45:38.862 --> 45:39.988
The train was delayed.

45:40.697 --> 45:43.659
You know how they are
about time.

45:50.499 --> 45:51.542
Xun.

45:51.667 --> 45:53.627
The trains, I apologize.

45:54.002 --> 45:55.045
He brought him.

45:55.212 --> 45:56.296
Who?

45:56.380 --> 45:57.673
Elliot.

45:58.882 --> 46:00.008
You met him?

46:00.676 --> 46:01.969
What did he say?

46:02.052 --> 46:04.304
He wanted to know what
stage 2 is.

46:05.722 --> 46:06.890
That doesn't make sense.

46:09.393 --> 46:11.019
Stage 2 is his plan.

46:21.238 --> 46:22.990
<i>It began as a failure.</i>

46:23.657 --> 46:25.033
<i>Everything.</i>

46:25.159 --> 46:26.493
<i>My existence.</i>

46:26.577 --> 46:28.328
<i>I should recognize that.</i>

46:28.412 --> 46:30.164
<i>Accept it.</i>

46:30.247 --> 46:33.041
<i>For me, there's no
such thing as normalcy.</i>

46:33.417 --> 46:36.044
<i>My dead father appears
and disappears at will.</i>

46:36.336 --> 46:38.881
<i>I talk to you,
an invisible friend.</i>

46:39.756 --> 46:43.343
<i>I'd ask if you're normal,
but you never talk back.</i>

46:44.386 --> 46:46.430
Did he ask about the others?
His friends...

46:46.847 --> 46:48.557
The man and the girl.

46:49.391 --> 46:50.517
No, he just...

46:50.601 --> 46:53.228
Stop! Hand me your phone.

46:53.562 --> 46:57.232
I follow protocol.
The phone's clean.

46:57.441 --> 46:59.902
He is a master.
You have to be extra careful.

47:57.834 --> 47:59.169
<i>How can I return to normal</i>

47:59.294 --> 48:01.129
<i>when the SUV belonging
to the man I murdered</i>

48:01.755 --> 48:03.674
<i>is parked
outside my apartment?</i>

48:10.347 --> 48:11.640
<i>Normal?</i>

48:12.516 --> 48:14.309
<i>I have no normal.</i>

48:29.866 --> 48:31.285
Hello, Ollie.
