00:20.360 --> 00:23.040
Skaara, join us.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.400
- You know why you're here?
- Then it is true.

00:30.520 --> 00:36.080
There's not much time. Kasuf will take
the women and children to safety.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.920
No one will be safe anywhere.

00:38.040 --> 00:42.160
How can we defend ourselves
against a Goa'uld as powerful as Anubis?

00:42.240 --> 00:46.160
Our lives are meaningless if we don't
stop him finding what he seeks.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.600
You must rally
all those capable of fighting.

00:49.720 --> 00:51.600
All those willing to die.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.480
All those who must not fail.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.640
Daniel

01:01.640 --> 01:04.400
You won't be alone.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.640
Hello, this is C... Hello?

02:54.400 --> 02:56.400
Jack?

02:57.720 --> 02:59.680
Jack?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.320
Hi, Jack.

03:06.280 --> 03:10.560
Jack, Abydos is in trouble.
Anubis is on his way.

03:10.640 --> 03:14.000
He's after the Eye of Ra.

03:14.080 --> 03:19.000
l have that replica Catherine gave me.
lt looks like this.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.480
The real one is in a secret chamber
in Ra's pyramid in Abydos

03:22.560 --> 03:26.800
but l'm not sure where exactly.
According to legend, there were six Eyes,

03:26.920 --> 03:29.520
including those
held by Apophis and Osiris.

03:29.640 --> 03:34.240
Each is powerful alone, but together
that power increases tenfold.

03:34.360 --> 03:41.200
Anubis has tracked down five of the Eyes
and only needs Ra's to complete the set.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.560
He's looked everywhere except Abydos.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.920
Now he's on his way there.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.200
l was sure that was an aspirin l took.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.040
Jack, it's really me. You have to
find the Eye of Ra before Anubis.

03:57.160 --> 04:01.280
Keep it, hide it, destroy it, whatever.
We don't have much time.

04:01.400 --> 04:07.640
Hey, Daniel. How ya doin'? Long time.
How are things in the higher planes?

04:07.760 --> 04:10.720
- Hey, Jack. How you doin'?
- Fine, just fine.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.240
- The knees, the back?
- Kind of weather-contingent.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.640
So, what's new?

04:16.760 --> 04:20.800
Actually,
a funny thing happened to me today.

04:20.880 --> 04:25.000
l'm in an elevator and an old friend,
someone who never calls, never writes,

04:25.120 --> 04:28.240
just shows up and tells me
about this very important,

04:28.360 --> 04:31.360
urgent mission that needs my attention.

04:31.480 --> 04:35.080
- Are you gonna help or...?
- Let me tell it. lt's good.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.480
You see, this buddy of mine,
this pal, this chum,

04:38.560 --> 04:44.440
has ascended
to a whole new level of existence.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.280
Do you see the irony?

04:47.360 --> 04:52.720
He's asking for my help,
and he's this great and powerful being.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.520
Jack, l can't actually do anything.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.760
l'm still not clear on that.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.880
The Others have rules.
Talking to you is a violation.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.280
Like jaywalking, double-parking?

05:03.400 --> 05:07.000
Taking action that changes
human existence, that's a big one.

05:07.080 --> 05:12.800
Let me ask you this.
Have you met any of these other guys?

05:12.920 --> 05:13.760
No.

05:13.840 --> 05:18.280
- Then how do you know they're a threat?
- Oh, that's a good one.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.320
Oma's an outcast because she believes
helping people ascend is our duty.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.560
And that's OK?

05:24.680 --> 05:30.400
Technically, no. But those of us that
follow her are walking a very fine line.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.280
- Why don't they try to stop her?
- l don't know.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.640
- You don't know?
- No. l know what Oma has taught me.

05:36.720 --> 05:42.080
Ascension doesn't make you all-knowing.
lt is just the beginning of the journey.

05:42.200 --> 05:46.560
The point is, if l were
to take any action to help you,

05:46.640 --> 05:50.400
Oma would stop me herself
to avoid drawing the wrath of the Others.

05:50.520 --> 05:56.000
They could stop everything
she's been trying to do for a long time.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.200
l can't jeopardise that.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.960
We can't match forces with Anubis

06:07.080 --> 06:11.360
but the Abydonians are willing
to back us on this one.

06:11.480 --> 06:15.040
Colonel, how'd you come by this intel?

06:15.160 --> 06:19.360
- (clears throat) l didn't say?
- No, you didn't.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.320
Daniel told me.

06:27.480 --> 06:31.360
- You saw Dr Jackson?
- Actually, it's not the first time.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.240
- (Carter) ls he all right?
- What else did he say?

06:34.360 --> 06:36.320
Whoa, wait

06:39.200 --> 06:43.440
You guys don't think l'm nuts
or anything like that?

06:43.520 --> 06:47.920
- l too have recently seen Daniel Jackson.
- Really?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.280
- Why didn't you say something?
- Why did you not?

06:51.400 --> 06:54.800
To be honest, l wasn't sure
it was happening the first time.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.480
Neither was l.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.840
Did he tell you
where we could find the Eye?

06:59.960 --> 07:02.160
Uh... he doesn't know.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.200
- He doesn't know?
- l know

07:05.280 --> 07:08.400
l think this whole
ascension thing is overrated.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.320
lt's good enough for me.

07:10.400 --> 07:16.560
lf Dr Jackson is right, we have to
find that Eye before Anubis does.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
O'Neill.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.280
Skaara.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.160
- lt is good to see you.
- You too.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.520
- l'm Jonas.
- Good to meet you.

07:41.400 --> 07:45.440
- We are prepared to do whatever you ask.
- Appreciate that.

07:45.520 --> 07:51.040
Teal'c, set up a perimeter. l want to know
the second we have company.

07:51.120 --> 07:55.680
- Any idea where this Eye thing is?
- l will show you.

08:45.160 --> 08:51.600
This is as far as the catacombs go.
Daniel and l have spent much time here.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.680
No Eyes?

08:53.800 --> 08:58.920
The Eye of Ra is mentioned many times
on these walls.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.880
Just so we're clear, it's not a real eye.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.600
lt's a kind of jewel or something.

09:05.680 --> 09:10.240
Well, we have never been able to find it.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.960
(O'Neill) So, you seeing anybody?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.520
Maybe.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.800
Really?

09:42.880 --> 09:45.440
ls it serious?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.600
We are betrothed.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.720
Trust me, that's serious.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.720
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.720
l assume my invitation
got lost in the mail or...

09:56.840 --> 10:00.360
l wanted to ask you to shaloke.

10:00.480 --> 10:05.600
- To stand beside me.
- Just during the ceremony, right?

10:05.680 --> 10:07.200
Yes, yes.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.680
l'd be honoured.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.480
Will you be coming to my wedding alone?

10:12.600 --> 10:14.360
Um...

10:15.240 --> 10:22.640
- l assume Carter's invited too?
- Of course. Will you be coming together?

10:22.720 --> 10:26.160
- As in...?
- Friends going to a wedding.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.360
Ah Yes. Sure.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.880
Jonas?

10:39.680 --> 10:42.040
ls there something you wish to ask me?

10:42.160 --> 10:46.200
- You are a friend of Daniel Jackson?
- lndeed l was.

10:47.760 --> 10:51.600
Skaara says he's not dead.
He's now a god.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.320
A god he is not.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.320
- ls he not powerful?
- That remains unclear.

11:00.080 --> 11:04.560
Daniel once brought freedom
to my people from the false god Ra.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.160
He has asked us to fight,
we will fight in his name.

11:08.240 --> 11:11.600
Die for his cause if we must.

11:11.720 --> 11:16.640
Skaara says Daniel will protect us,
watch over our families.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.880
l am unsure
as to what you have been promised.

11:20.960 --> 11:25.840
But if you are not prepared to die,
you should not be here.

11:33.400 --> 11:38.960
- How ya doin'? We don't have all day.
- l know, believe me. But there's nothing.

11:39.080 --> 11:43.360
Just a lot of talk about the power of Ra,
the size of his domain.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.720
Big domain?

11:44.800 --> 11:50.160
No mention of a secret chamber where
he keeps his most valued possessions.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.800
- Right.
- (explosions above)

12:24.400 --> 12:27.920
(Teal'c) O'Neill, we're under attack.
Ground forces have landed.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.240
We will not be able
to hold them off for long.

12:30.360 --> 12:33.120
- Roger. You heard him.
- l don't know what to say.

12:33.240 --> 12:37.680
- lf Dr Jackson was here...
- Oh, he's here. Trust me, he's here.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.760
Son of a bitch

12:44.800 --> 12:47.080
Hey Where are ya?

12:48.640 --> 12:50.960
We're only doin' this because of you.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.040
Jack.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.080
lt's here. l know it is.

12:56.160 --> 12:59.520
- Daniel
- Sam. Jonas.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.960
Dr Jackson.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.120
- You hear that?
- (explosions)

13:03.200 --> 13:05.200
l can't do anything about that.

13:05.320 --> 13:08.800
l don't care.
Do something or we walk, right now.

13:08.880 --> 13:12.320
Remember that fine line
we were talking about?

13:12.440 --> 13:14.400
Cross it.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.920
OK.

13:24.200 --> 13:28.640
l always thought
there might be a secret chamber here.

13:32.120 --> 13:37.120
This section talks about
how Ra draws his power from the sun.

13:38.760 --> 13:42.880
(Teal'c) O'Neill,
we cannot hold our position.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.200
Fall back to the pyramid.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.520
You do your stuff.
l'm gonna help Teal'c.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.600
l will come with you.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.720
Fall back

14:00.040 --> 14:02.000
Fall back

14:16.560 --> 14:22.560
Um... can't you just zip into the wall and
see if there's something on the other side?

14:22.640 --> 14:23.920
lt's complicated.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.080
Some kind of trigger for a secret door.
''Rays of the sun... reveal all.''

14:31.640 --> 14:34.720
Rays of the sun. There's no sunlight.

14:36.400 --> 14:40.400
- Do you think any light will do?
- lt's possible.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.360
Maybe you need to focus it a little.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.680
OK.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.160
ls that my stuff?

15:00.280 --> 15:02.800
You weren't using it any more.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.880
Yeah.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.960
- How many?
- Many.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.400
- Carter?
- Sir, we're working on it.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.040
Work faster.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.960
Yes, sir.

15:31.080 --> 15:34.680
l thought we were onto something, but...

15:34.800 --> 15:37.240
- You were.
- lt's not working.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.400
- lt's red.
- What is?

15:46.520 --> 15:49.760
The rays of the sun on the fresco are red.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.880
- Sam?
- Yeah.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.280
Jonas.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.440
Sweet.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.560
Daniel, what is it?

17:49.520 --> 17:52.240
- l'm an Ancient.
- What?

17:52.360 --> 17:56.440
Not me, but the Others like me,
they're the Ancients.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.640
This is one of their oldest dialects.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.120
l always suspected
but never knew for sure.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.360
What does it say?

18:04.480 --> 18:07.040
The Ancients evolved
from a human race long ago.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.600
They were wiped out by a plague.

18:09.720 --> 18:13.240
Many learned to ascend
and the rest died out.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.760
- l have to go.
- Where?

18:17.880 --> 18:22.160
l'll be back. Don't lose that tablet.
lt talks of a lost city. lt's invaluable.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.240
Daniel...

18:35.240 --> 18:37.200
Teal'c

18:42.600 --> 18:45.680
- What if it's not here?
- Maybe there's a secret compartment.

18:45.760 --> 18:49.080
- lnside a secret chamber?
- Why not?

18:50.080 --> 18:52.200
Why not?

19:06.480 --> 19:08.480
(hollow clang)

19:10.560 --> 19:12.560
Right here.

19:17.440 --> 19:21.320
l can't see a latch or a jewel
like with the other door,

19:21.400 --> 19:25.920
- but there's gotta be a way to open this.
- Yeah. Stand back.

20:04.720 --> 20:08.400
- Sir, we got it.
- lt's too late.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.440
We did not hold the gate room.
Anubis dialled the Stargate,

20:11.560 --> 20:14.680
- preventing our escape.
- Got Jaffa on our ass.

20:16.080 --> 20:19.200
- Where's that Eye?
- Right here.

20:22.080 --> 20:28.720
- What are you gonna do with that?
- See how much Anubis wants that thing.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.000
Surrender or die.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.560
What?

20:58.680 --> 21:00.640
Surrender or die.

21:02.720 --> 21:06.960
l was just gonna say the exact same thing.

21:07.080 --> 21:10.200
O'Neill of SG-1 .

21:14.680 --> 21:17.320
Hey, how ya doin'?

21:17.400 --> 21:21.200
You'll have to forgive me,
l'm terrible with names. What was...

21:21.320 --> 21:23.680
Jeez

21:25.440 --> 21:27.120
l am Herak.

21:27.200 --> 21:31.200
Congratulations. Baling upwards, l see.

21:31.280 --> 21:35.120
- You have no choice.
- Actually, l do.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.200
l've got the Eye,

21:37.320 --> 21:40.640
and a pound of very powerful explosive
stuck to it.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.360
Give us clear access to the gate
or l'll blow it up.

21:44.480 --> 21:47.920
Yourself along with it?

21:48.040 --> 21:51.280
What's your point?

21:51.360 --> 21:55.040
- l will speak with my master.
- Yes. You do that.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.800
Don't forget to tell him
you screwed up again.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.840
- ls it necessary to antagonise him?
- Yes.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.480
Would you really do it?

22:10.560 --> 22:12.640
Sure. Why not?

22:12.720 --> 22:14.720
(Teal'c) O'Neill.

22:17.760 --> 22:21.840
Skaara is in need of medical attention.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.480
l've failed you.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.480
Now stop it.

22:37.440 --> 22:43.440
My lord. Humans from Earth and the one
named O'Neill have found the Eye of Ra.

22:43.560 --> 22:47.760
We have them trapped, but he says
if we do not grant them free passage

22:47.880 --> 22:50.080
he will destroy the Eye.

22:50.200 --> 22:55.360
(distorted) He will give you the Eye of Ra,
or l will destroy Abydos.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.440
Yes, my lord.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.240
You won't touch Abydos.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.960
- And how will you stop me?
- l can,

23:11.040 --> 23:14.000
and l will
if one more person down there is hurt.

23:14.120 --> 23:19.200
You can only stand there and utter empty
threats, because l know what you are.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.800
lf you know what l am,
you know l can wipe you from existence.

23:22.880 --> 23:28.800
l know who you are, Daniel Jackson,
but you know not who l am.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.200
O'Neill, can you hear me?

23:46.240 --> 23:48.000
Yeah.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.960
Anubis commands you
to turn over the Eye of Ra

23:51.040 --> 23:53.480
or he will destroy all of Abydos.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.400
Tell him to go ahead.
He's not getting the Eye.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.680
He's bluffing.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.320
We won't have much choice.

24:06.440 --> 24:09.680
lf we blow up the Eye
he'll destroy Abydos anyway.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.600
He's just as likely to attack
after we give it to him.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.080
Maybe not.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.920
He's a Goa'uld.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.720
(Skaara) O'Neill?

24:27.760 --> 24:30.880
ln didea varsukay yanuk.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.560
- What's he saying?
- He speaks of a bright light.

24:36.680 --> 24:39.040
Nat zee gougah.

24:39.120 --> 24:42.560
Of giving up.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.720
Of releasing something.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.120
Sapur.

25:42.520 --> 25:46.800
(distorted) With a wave of my hand,
l will bombard the surface.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.480
Try and stop me if you choose.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.360
What makes you think l won't?

25:53.480 --> 25:56.160
Your words mean nothing.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.640
Take action...

25:58.760 --> 26:00.720
if you dare.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.280
Maybe l won't have to.

26:22.640 --> 26:26.160
l command the collective forces
of the System Lords.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.120
You managed to rally them against me.

26:29.240 --> 26:33.600
You hand over the Eye of Ra
or face destruction.

26:33.720 --> 26:38.000
l will consider your most generous offer.

26:42.480 --> 26:45.280
You won't survive that many motherships.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.920
They're not attacking
because they fear me.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.680
Maybe. Maybe l'll tell them
you don't have the Eye.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.840
And they can beat you if they strike now.

26:53.960 --> 26:59.920
- Do you know that for a fact?
- Maybe l'll deliver the Eye of Ra to you,

27:00.000 --> 27:05.280
if you give me your word you won't
harm the people of Abydos - ever.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.400
So be it.

27:08.520 --> 27:12.800
That's a promise l'll hold you to
no matter what.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.320
Sir, you're not considering
shooting our way out?

27:18.400 --> 27:22.160
No. Anubis must really
want that thing in one piece

27:22.280 --> 27:26.640
- if his boys have held off this long.
- He does.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.520
- Where were you?
- Busy busy.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.520
Hey...

27:33.600 --> 27:36.880
Thanks for Skaara. l assume he's OK.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.360
What are you talking about?

27:40.440 --> 27:43.440
- He has ascended.
- What?

27:43.520 --> 27:45.680
That wasn't you?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Oma's here watching me.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.720
- And?
- And l don't care any more.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.520
- Anubis is one of us.
- What?

27:55.600 --> 27:58.640
At least partly, in some bastardised way.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.320
What are you talking about?

28:00.440 --> 28:03.120
The Goa'uld Anubis used to be
learned how to ascend.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.280
He was believed dead for some time.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.920
- The Others didn't want him.
- Understandable.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.920
- They sent him back. At least they tried.
- And what is he now?

28:12.000 --> 28:16.560
He's still some form of energy.
That black mask is a shield,

28:16.640 --> 28:18.320
keeping his form intact.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.360
He's stuck between
human existence and ascension.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.080
Why have the Others
allowed him to remain that way?

28:24.160 --> 28:27.120
- Maybe they couldn't exile him.
- Maybe they don't care.

28:27.240 --> 28:30.080
Maybe. Either way he's still very powerful.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.200
That explains his mastery
of Ancient technology.

28:33.320 --> 28:37.440
- How's that?
- Jack, the Others are the Ancients.

28:37.520 --> 28:41.360
The original creators of the Stargates.

28:41.480 --> 28:44.400
- You didn't tell him?
- Uh, no.

28:44.520 --> 28:46.640
(footsteps)

28:56.320 --> 29:01.240
All right, look,
just bottom-line this for me, will ya?

29:01.360 --> 29:05.440
System Lord motherships are surrounding
Anubis. l warned them about the Eye.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.720
Nice

29:07.200 --> 29:10.080
- Turn it over.
- What?

29:10.160 --> 29:13.440
l made a deal with Anubis.
You turn the Eye over, you go free,

29:13.520 --> 29:15.360
and Abydos will remain unharmed.

29:15.480 --> 29:19.600
- You made a deal with Anubis?
- l'll make sure he keeps it.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.960
The Goa'uld will fight over the Eye
and destroy each other.

29:23.080 --> 29:27.760
But even if they don't, you're gonna find
the lost city of the Ancients.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.600
Lost city?

29:29.680 --> 29:31.840
Didn't tell him about that either?

29:31.920 --> 29:34.160
Daniel found a tablet
talking of a lost city.

29:34.280 --> 29:38.400
Where there are Ancient weapons capable
of giving you an advantage over Anubis.

29:38.520 --> 29:42.040
- Do you know where it is?
- No, but l'll help you find it.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.560
Nothing will happen to the Abydonians.
You've got to get away with that tablet.

29:48.680 --> 29:52.240
lf Anubis gets it and finds the lost city
before you do, it's all over.

29:52.360 --> 29:57.200
He already has a huge advantage over you
because of what the Others failed to do.

30:00.480 --> 30:04.160
- You gonna kick his ass?
- lf l have to.

30:04.240 --> 30:08.480
- Can you?
- We'll see.

30:08.560 --> 30:12.240
Nothing will happen
to the people of Abydos.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.680
(O'Neill) Coming out

30:40.480 --> 30:45.360
l assume you know about the part
where you don't kill us?

30:47.600 --> 30:49.840
As much as l would like to.

31:08.680 --> 31:11.120
Jaffa Kree

31:28.920 --> 31:30.880
Well, spank me rosy.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.480
Let's book.

31:52.760 --> 31:56.240
My lord. The Eye of Ra.

32:36.240 --> 32:39.680
(distorted) The ship's weapons
are now fully powered.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.120
Your time is up.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.120
Of that you are gravely mistaken.

33:08.080 --> 33:11.920
Sounds like a hell of a battle
going on up there.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.280
They are retreating.

33:25.360 --> 33:26.720
Yes.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.680
What now, my lord?

33:33.800 --> 33:36.480
Now l will destroy Abydos.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.920
Stop

33:53.400 --> 33:56.000
Stop me if you can.

34:08.159 --> 34:10.000
Strike me down.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.719
Do it now or l will destroy Abydos.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.360
(Daniel groans) Don't do this

34:34.840 --> 34:37.679
You are indeed all-powerful, my lord.

34:37.800 --> 34:41.760
(distorted) What you just saw
was not my doing.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.880
However, this is.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.520
(screaming)

35:09.440 --> 35:11.440
(alarm)

35:14.760 --> 35:16.480
What was that?

35:26.560 --> 35:29.120
- What just happened?
- Abydos was hit.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.840
- You saw it?
- l felt it.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.160
Just before l came through.

35:35.240 --> 35:38.720
Sergeant, call up a full gate diagnostic

35:40.960 --> 35:44.360
- What have you got?
- l'm workin' on it.

35:45.600 --> 35:50.440
A large burst of energy was transmitted
just after Colonel O'Neill came through.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.440
Carter?

35:51.560 --> 35:55.640
Lucky they closed the iris when they did.
An energy wave followed you through.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.240
- Redial.
- Yes, sir.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.040
Welcome back, SG-1 . What's happened?

36:01.160 --> 36:04.240
There was an explosion on the planet
after we left, sir.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.640
- ls that possible?
- Unfortunately, sir.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.760
We're dialling Abydos
to see what happened.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.840
Chevron six encoded.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.880
Chevron seven will not lock.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.560
- Briefing room.
- Yes, sir.

36:27.480 --> 36:31.280
The only thing we can assume is that
Anubis didn't keep his deal with Daniel.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.040
That's a shock, eh?

36:33.160 --> 36:37.040
And that he was unable to prevent
Anubis from destroying Abydos.

36:37.160 --> 36:42.360
Now Anubis has a weapon that has given
him superiority over the System Lords.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.400
We don't know any of that for sure, sir.

36:44.520 --> 36:48.960
We need to find the city
that's described on that tablet.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.720
Can you translate this?

36:50.800 --> 36:56.120
Yeah. lt'll take some time
but Dr Jackson did offer his assistance.

36:56.200 --> 36:59.440
l'm not sure
we can count on Daniel any more.

36:59.520 --> 37:03.200
He would have done everything
in his power to protect the Abydonians.

37:03.280 --> 37:06.960
lf he was prevented
from doing that, then...

37:11.680 --> 37:14.720
(alarm)

37:15.600 --> 37:17.360
Chevron five encoded.

37:17.480 --> 37:22.240
Major, how many times are we gonna
dial Abydos before you give up?

37:22.360 --> 37:28.160
Until a Tok'ra ship flies over the planet
and tells me there's no one left alive.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.240
Chevron six encoded.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.560
Chevron seven...

37:38.680 --> 37:40.640
locked.

37:43.960 --> 37:47.280
The MALP shows the pyramid is intact.
No evident damage.

37:47.400 --> 37:50.640
- What about the explosion?
- l can't explain it, sir.

37:50.760 --> 37:55.680
l'd like to go, sir.
Make sure the people are OK.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.160
l guess everybody's all right.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.880
Skaara?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.960
O'Neill.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.320
What's going on here?

39:32.400 --> 39:37.440
Anubis destroyed the pyramid.
Everyone was killed in the blast.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.640
They don't look dead to me.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.080
But then neither do you.

39:45.480 --> 39:49.240
Death is only the beginning
of one's journey.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.640
That sounds familiar.

39:53.720 --> 39:57.040
- What of Daniel Jackson?
- l've not seen Daniel.

39:57.160 --> 40:00.160
- Do you know if he's OK?
- l do not know.

40:00.280 --> 40:02.160
One named Oma did this.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.000
All of you?

40:08.080 --> 40:10.120
l wish you well, O'Neill.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.240
You will not see me again.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.880
At least not for a while.

40:17.520 --> 40:20.880
- Take care.
- Do not fear.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.600
You will find your way.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.560
What do you mean by that?

40:38.880 --> 40:42.480
The Chaapa-ai will remain until you leave.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.880
Let's go home.
