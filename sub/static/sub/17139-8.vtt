00:06.120 --> 00:08.521
SAM: <i>So, you're what,
you're English Men of Letters?</i>

00:08.680 --> 00:10.444
- British.
- We wanna work with you.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.126
- Mick, is it?
- My number.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.282
What do we think?
Are we buying that Brit's whole

00:18.440 --> 00:20.602
<i>- "let's be friends" routine?</i>
- SAM: <i>No. No way.</i>

00:20.760 --> 00:23.764
The Winchesters are no better
than the monsters they fail to control.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.611
- They need to be eliminated.
- Well, we have Mr. Ketch for that.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.444
MR. KETCH:
<i>I cleaned up the Winchesters' mess.</i>

00:28.720 --> 00:31.007
<i>As suspected,
they couldn't finish the job.</i>

00:31.240 --> 00:32.287
MAN: <i>Thank you, Mr. Ketch.</i>

00:32.439 --> 00:36.331
CROWLEY: <i>Your dinner date is loaded,
single and possibly in delicate health.</i>

00:36.520 --> 00:40.286
ROWENA: <i>It's my chance to leave behind
monsters and demons and moldy hideouts.</i>

00:40.440 --> 00:43.125
CROWLEY: <i>Lucifer.
Wearing Vince Vincente.</i>

00:43.480 --> 00:45.323
You're, kind of, famous.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.643
LUCIFER: <i>Onward and upward.</i>

00:49.160 --> 00:51.367
CROWLEY: <i>That's why he's jumping
from vessel to vessel.</i>

00:51.520 --> 00:53.249
CASTIEL: <i>Me finding him
is my responsibility.</i>

00:53.400 --> 00:55.607
Cass, you're gonna want
some backup on this.

00:55.760 --> 00:58.491
If you get Lucifer cornered
and find yourself in need,

00:58.640 --> 00:59.687
I'm there.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.049
DEAN: <i>Cass is chumming it up with Crowley.
They're hunting Lucifer, together.</i>

01:03.200 --> 01:04.769
Feathers and I are all but inseparable.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.610
Together again.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.801
Yay.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.089
NEWSCASTER: <i>And if the unprecedented
drought conditions persist,</i>

01:20.320 --> 01:21.731
<i>farmers in the state worry</i>

01:21.880 --> 01:24.565
<i>that the entirety of next year's crop
could be lost,</i>

01:24.800 --> 01:26.802
<i>driving up prices worldwide.</i>

01:26.960 --> 01:29.964
<i>In other news, police are investigating
the mysterious death</i>

01:30.120 --> 01:33.010
<i>of billionaire philanthropist
Wallace Parker.</i>

01:33.160 --> 01:35.925
<i>Parker was found dead
in his office late Tuesday,</i>

01:36.080 --> 01:38.765
<i>- his body heavily damaged...</i>
- MAN: <i>Turn that off.</i>

01:44.360 --> 01:47.045
Better we stay focused
on the lord's work,

01:47.280 --> 01:48.486
wouldn't you agree?

01:49.240 --> 01:51.049
Of course, Your Excellency.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.611
Such a shame, about Mr. Parker.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.569
I know he was a friend.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.525
Not to mention one of our biggest donors.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.166
Yes.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.764
Your colleagues are already inside.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.923
- Agents.
- Okay. This has gotta stop. All right?

02:55.080 --> 02:56.127
Give me that.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.243
- Armani.
- Okay, enough.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.204
Let's have a look.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.531
Ooh. Looks like somebody forgot
to put on his sunscreen.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.728
This was Wallace Parker,

03:08.920 --> 03:11.571
the very powerful CEO
of almost everything.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.567
And apparently, Lucifer's latest vessel.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.966
Wasn't strong enough to hold him.

03:17.160 --> 03:22.451
Lucifer's not content with slutting it
from one random vessel to the next.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.208
He's moving on to blue chips.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.962
<i>Celebrities, captains of industry.</i>

03:28.160 --> 03:30.561
He just got a lot more dangerous.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.770
- I agree with Agent Zappa.
- Will you stop?

03:36.480 --> 03:37.811
DEAN: So, find anything?

03:37.960 --> 03:41.646
Anyone powerful or respectable
who suddenly changed or exploded?

03:41.800 --> 03:42.926
Well, this is pretty interesting.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.846
This is the Archbishop of St. Louis
with Wallace Parker.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.763
- So?
- So that was him three days ago.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.160
And this

03:52.480 --> 03:53.811
is him last night.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.206
At the opening of a food kitchen.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.283
<i>Notice anything missing?</i>

04:03.000 --> 04:04.968
Yeah, the big mother of a cross
around his neck.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.610
Exactly. And this morning,

04:06.760 --> 04:10.003
his office canceled all further public
appearances without comment.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.767
Okay, so you're thinking that
Lucifer blasted out of Parker

04:12.920 --> 04:15.321
and into his buddy, the Archbishop here.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.369
- Worth a shot.
- Yeah.

04:38.280 --> 04:39.691
- It's awfully quiet.
- Yeah.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.882
I put in a dozen calls
to the Chief of Staff.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.371
No one returned.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.124
Well, we'll have a look around.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.362
If it is Lucifer, we'll call
the rest of the Scooby Gang.

04:47.560 --> 04:48.846
Hey.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.046
Great.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.531
Father. Hey.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.690
What happened?

05:28.560 --> 05:31.609
We knew something was wrong. He...

05:32.560 --> 05:34.403
- He...
- The Archbishop?

05:48.400 --> 05:50.129
PRIEST: <i>Senior staff decided...</i>

05:51.120 --> 05:53.930
Handle internally and intervene...

05:55.880 --> 05:57.211
An exorcism.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.360
Hey.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.204
If I agree to this,

07:18.880 --> 07:20.689
we would be partners.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.881
We'd bring a true era
of spirituality to America

07:27.040 --> 07:28.804
and heal her wounds?

07:32.720 --> 07:34.290
Then hallelujah.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.651
I humbly accept your guidance.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.680
Yes.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.131
Swell.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.491
Now what?

08:32.320 --> 08:34.004
Okay, then, Jeff.

08:34.799 --> 08:38.441
Usually, I give my hosts more downtime,
but in this case,

08:38.760 --> 08:40.727
high-profile as it is,

08:42.840 --> 08:46.481
I may need help
fine-tuning some protocols,

08:47.560 --> 08:51.610
if I'm going to deliver
on all the goodness,

08:52.600 --> 08:54.921
public service that I promised.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.370
I'm happy to help, partner.

08:57.520 --> 09:00.091
We're appearing
at a series of fundraisers here,

09:00.240 --> 09:02.163
backed by a fantastic group of aides.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.484
So, I just focus on the big picture.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.928
JEFFERSON: <i>The team handles the details.</i>

09:08.120 --> 09:09.963
LUCIFER: <i>Well, listen, Jeff,</i>

09:10.680 --> 09:13.331
<i>this is all useful information, of course,</i>

09:13.520 --> 09:17.320
<i>but if we're gonna pull this off,</i>

09:17.600 --> 09:21.207
I'm gonna need a few more
personal details.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.610
<i>People need to believe that I am, in fact,</i>

09:25.520 --> 09:27.921
President of the United States.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.524
LUCIFER: One minute we're talking about
the best barbecue.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.160
I'm a Kansas City man, Bill,

10:02.720 --> 10:04.210
likes Memphis.

10:04.840 --> 10:08.208
I stepped into the john.
When I came out, he was on the ground.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.600
I...

10:09.800 --> 10:11.689
I tried CPR, but...

10:11.960 --> 10:13.883
I'm sure you did
everything you could, sir,

10:14.360 --> 10:18.365
but it appears
he had a massive cerebral hemorrhage.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.248
We're gonna need an autopsy,
but I don't see any evidence of foul play.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.729
If you'd like to say a few words, sir?

10:30.960 --> 10:33.725
A few words to the man upstairs, sir.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.802
Like you do every morning.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.760
Yes.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.000
Words.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.210
Nothing we ever say feels like enough.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.366
Babies.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.642
That's what we are.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.805
Innocents.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.048
All of us, struggling to

11:13.440 --> 11:16.762
walk upright with purpose and pride.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.081
And yet we need our Father

11:23.000 --> 11:26.402
to be there when we fall.

11:27.120 --> 11:32.286
Today, we lost a brother. Tomorrow,
we will continue our work for the country.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.123
- Amen.
- Amen.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.603
You always know the right thing to say.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.761
Ugh...

12:03.960 --> 12:05.610
These pictures...

12:06.200 --> 12:09.170
The level of violence,
it's completely unnecessary.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.682
Lucifer doesn't like being messed with.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.606
I guess when the Archbishop's priests
figured out he was possessed,

12:15.800 --> 12:18.451
they tried to keep it quiet,
do an exorcism.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.927
I mean, not that it would've worked.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.966
Lucifer blew town, but not before
he slaughtered the entire staff.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.891
So, we were on the right trail,
but where does it go now?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.485
I don't know.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.087
Who won the Nobel Peace Prize?
Why don't we start there?

12:38.040 --> 12:41.362
KELLY: <i>While we've been away from D.C.
in Belarus,</i>

12:41.520 --> 12:44.569
negotiations between rebel forces
and the government have broken down.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.722
We're recalling Ambassador Harkin.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.924
Sir, is it time to involve the UN?

12:51.200 --> 12:52.201
Mmm...

12:52.360 --> 12:55.364
That, or we can just go ahead
and nuke them.

13:11.320 --> 13:15.530
Well! Montroy fund-raiser at 2:00,
we'll pick this up at dinner.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.080
Sir?

13:27.480 --> 13:29.403
Thought you might wanna know.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.403
New poll numbers are out.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.726
You're way up.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.690
Officially the most popular
sitting President in modern history.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.570
- Really?
- Mmm.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.048
Hmm. That's impressive.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.244
Uh, Otto.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.209
- Take a little break.
- Mmm.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.808
Was there something else?

13:55.360 --> 13:56.771
KELLY: Well...

13:58.360 --> 14:00.442
- So amazing.
- Yeah.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.249
It's almost like
I've never done that before.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.682
You.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.126
You know, Jeff,

14:11.920 --> 14:13.445
I admit,

14:14.720 --> 14:18.122
it makes things kind of exciting,
keeping this a secret.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.605
I just wish

14:22.040 --> 14:25.010
we could make
how we feel about each other...

14:25.680 --> 14:27.125
Well, public.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.441
Oh?

14:31.280 --> 14:32.611
I know,

14:33.440 --> 14:35.442
people might not like it.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.965
Public might not like it
because you're a widower.

14:40.920 --> 14:41.921
Uh-huh.

14:42.120 --> 14:46.842
But I know you've been lonely
since Louise died.

14:47.800 --> 14:48.961
Hmm...

14:49.200 --> 14:52.602
And I know your feelings for me are real.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.690
Because everything you do is real.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.962
I'd just love to think that

15:03.680 --> 15:05.170
some day

15:06.800 --> 15:08.848
we could be a real couple.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.642
Maybe do the wedding thing.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.364
Maybe the baby thing.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.405
I just...

15:24.960 --> 15:27.725
I just know you'd make an amazing father.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.531
Good girl, you're right on time.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.210
Your Majesty.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.721
Keep this up and you could
actually earn back your soul.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.890
What little tidbit
do you have for me today?

16:03.080 --> 16:07.404
There was a death last night
that I ascribed to natural causes, but...

16:08.720 --> 16:10.768
It was anything but natural.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.568
Did the Bunker's warding fail?

16:15.720 --> 16:18.769
I just powered it down. Crowley called,
said he had some big news about Lucifer.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.684
Whatever the hell that means.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.251
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.928
So now, Crowley can just, what,
drop in whenever he feels like it?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.888
I'd prefer keeping Crowley at a distance.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.326
Long distance.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.767
CROWLEY: <i>Not very charitable, Moose.</i>

16:35.680 --> 16:40.129
Particularly, since once again
I'm saving both your asses.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.522
So, as you know,

16:42.680 --> 16:45.251
I'm temporarily persona non grata
in my own palace.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.965
- Palace?
- Palace?

16:47.160 --> 16:49.845
However, there are those I still control.
Operatives...

16:50.000 --> 16:51.968
Crowley, can we just get the damn news
without the drama?

16:52.120 --> 16:53.770
Can I get you without the flannel?

16:53.920 --> 16:55.524
No. Still I endure.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.921
What?

16:57.440 --> 16:59.204
Did a little digging,

16:59.400 --> 17:00.845
acting on a tip.

17:01.920 --> 17:06.005
I think I know the identity
of Lucifer's newest vessel.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.763
For God's sakes.

17:07.960 --> 17:08.961
Ah-ha!

17:09.599 --> 17:11.045
Gentlemen,

17:12.280 --> 17:14.203
I give you one Jefferson Rooney,

17:14.400 --> 17:16.971
President of these United States.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.048
You wanted to see me, sir?

17:38.880 --> 17:41.008
Rick, something urgent's come up.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.483
- Urgent and confidential.
- Understood.

17:45.840 --> 17:49.731
We have reliable intel that
two mentally unstable individuals,

17:50.040 --> 17:51.929
possibly cult members,

17:52.800 --> 17:55.371
have imminent plans to assassinate me.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.968
What? Why?

17:58.200 --> 17:59.884
Because I'm Satan.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.282
They think I'm Satan.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.004
Not metaphorically.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.161
Mmm.

18:08.760 --> 18:09.761
In the flesh.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.885
- Satan's not real.
- Well...

18:13.040 --> 18:16.362
He's a symbol for the simpleminded.
A comic book villain.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.841
He's a bit more than that, Rick.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.371
To many people.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.285
- I wasn't briefed on this.
- Well, I'm briefing you now.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.284
We've been sitting on it
until we had more facts.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.244
Aside from the obvious peril to me...

18:28.400 --> 18:29.970
We'll keep it strictly
under the radar, sir.

18:30.120 --> 18:34.523
I think the best way to do that is to
eliminate the threat. Would you agree?

18:34.680 --> 18:38.048
- We could initiate the approval process.
- No. No.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.366
We need to handle this in the family.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.409
Secret Service only.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.849
And as the head of my personal detail,
you will head this up yourself.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.291
Of course.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.805
I'm liking this job, Rick.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.968
I wanna keep it a while.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.324
MICK ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
<i>Hello? Mick Davies here. Leave a message.</i>

19:15.240 --> 19:18.687
Even if Crowley does bring in Rowena,
the problem remains.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.407
Lucifer can't be returned
to the Cage inside his vessel.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.767
His essence has to be extracted.

19:25.440 --> 19:29.001
Yeah. And Lucifer has found
the perfect safe house.

19:29.240 --> 19:32.210
I mean, how do we even start
getting close to the President?

19:32.440 --> 19:34.442
Well, it helps that he's not in D.C.

19:34.600 --> 19:38.127
Rooney's actually on a fund-raising swing
through the Midwest.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.563
Yeah. Right now, it looks like
his whole party, aides, Secret Service,

19:41.760 --> 19:45.003
the whole circus is staying
at an estate owned by Ron Forester,

19:45.240 --> 19:47.129
the hedge fund zillionaire.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.760
It's right outside Indianapolis.

19:50.120 --> 19:54.045
But it is completely surrounded
by walls, security,

19:54.240 --> 19:56.242
<i>Secret Service, military.</i>

19:57.080 --> 19:58.286
Plan B?

19:58.800 --> 20:00.609
He's got a hell of a speaking schedule.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.325
He's averaging three events a day.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.289
And he's got a gala dinner
on Friday night.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.442
Well, at least he'll be
outside of the mansion.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.644
Yeah. Guarded like the Hope Diamond.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.646
Plan C?

20:13.120 --> 20:16.363
What about us?
Our feelings for each other?

20:16.520 --> 20:18.602
That's why I've been
totally upfront about Mona.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.051
Mona?

20:21.480 --> 20:22.527
Mona Levin.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.164
Mona Levin, the heiress?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.245
You've been seeing her, as well?

20:30.400 --> 20:32.641
You know, one has to keep
one's options open.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.167
The heart knows what the heart knows.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.971
And what does your heart know about me?

20:38.520 --> 20:40.841
It knows that it's fond of you,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.401
but your credentials were unverifiable.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.642
Financial holdings, Royal Ballet,
none of it!

20:45.800 --> 20:47.689
You had me investigated?

20:50.160 --> 20:51.605
You were scamming me.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.531
- There's the pot calling the kettle black.
- CROWLEY: Ahem.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.649
Ah. Finally.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.526
Light starch.

21:01.840 --> 21:06.050
I opened my heart to a pauper
who was after my non-existent fortune!

21:06.240 --> 21:09.369
Same as I did, sweetie.
I'm just being honest about it.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.847
- Who is this?
- My latest fiancé.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.044
And if I tell Mona the truth?

21:15.640 --> 21:17.085
That'd be a first.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.890
- Get out!
- It's my place!

21:19.040 --> 21:20.326
Mother.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.521
Mother?

21:38.040 --> 21:39.041
Hmm.

21:42.840 --> 21:46.322
That is the sweetest thing
you've ever done for me.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.163
Promise you won't laugh.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.241
Even if it's funny?

22:00.560 --> 22:01.561
Shh.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.924
I won't laugh.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.571
Tonight,

22:07.760 --> 22:09.842
us here, it felt...

22:12.000 --> 22:13.081
Different.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.369
- Now I'm really not laughing.
- No...

22:18.920 --> 22:20.649
We were great as always.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.001
But,

22:23.520 --> 22:24.931
somehow,

22:25.960 --> 22:28.770
in some way I can't describe,

22:29.080 --> 22:30.605
it feels like

22:32.800 --> 22:34.211
something's changed.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.002
Maybe something has.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.404
Cass? Hey.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.882
Something's happened, something's...

23:14.160 --> 23:16.766
- It's angel radio, there's so many voices.
- What are they saying?

23:18.640 --> 23:22.008
There's been a massive surge
in celestial energy.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.445
A Nephilim has come into being.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.328
It's the offspring
of an angel and a human.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.441
- And that's big news?
- Yes.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.369
But the power that produced this
is immense.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.126
It's much, much greater
than a typical angel.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.281
Lucifer.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.090
Lucifer?

23:46.960 --> 23:49.088
I didn't know he was dating.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.089
SAM: <i>Yeah, and hey, Crowley, uh,</i>

23:56.240 --> 23:59.323
find out from your government mole
if there's a girlfriend, or a mistress,

23:59.480 --> 24:02.211
or a favorite hooker,
or someone we don't know about.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.329
Got it. All right.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.926
Crowley and Rowena
will meet us in Indianapolis.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.650
Do we have a plan?

24:09.520 --> 24:12.490
Impeach LOTUS and find Rosemary's baby.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.201
Oh, crap.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.888
OFFICER ON RADIO: <i>Vehicle in sight. Stand by.</i>

24:50.080 --> 24:52.242
All right. Stay here. We got this.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.807
Gentlemen, is there a problem?

25:02.120 --> 25:04.088
Federal agents, guys.
We need to keep going.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.924
And I need 6 grand by Saturday,
but that ain't happening, either.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.807
You guys know
who you're talking to?

25:12.440 --> 25:13.601
Winchesters.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.571
You made those toy badges
in craft class in the psych ward?

25:18.720 --> 25:20.927
Nice car, by the way.
It really stands out.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.560
Hey. Wait.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.090
Wait a second now.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.288
Let him go! Now!

25:46.000 --> 25:47.126
Stop!

25:47.840 --> 25:49.968
- Don't move!
- Cass, don't.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.840
MR. KETCH:
You, Angel. Wipe their memories.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.929
US Government plates.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.043
Elite dogcatcher level.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.168
Someone special wants you.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.967
Whose hydrant
have you lads been tinkling on?

26:55.240 --> 26:56.810
I'm sorry, who the hell are you?

26:57.040 --> 26:59.202
Oh. Where are my manners?

26:59.360 --> 27:02.364
Arthur Ketch. British Men of Letters.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.848
<i>So, it's all very simple, really.</i>

27:10.040 --> 27:14.045
Mick Davies asked you to join our effort,
which we're taking international.

27:14.240 --> 27:19.007
My instructions are to strongly
encourage a "yes."

27:19.160 --> 27:21.049
And so, what,
you've just been following us?

27:21.240 --> 27:24.050
Not at all. We're good dogs,
we only come when called.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.564
And he called.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.122
- You what?
- I didn't...

27:32.640 --> 27:34.529
- I hung up.
- Yes, you did.

27:34.720 --> 27:39.044
Which made Mr. Davies think that
you were in trouble, which you were.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.409
So, he rings me, bing-bang-boom,
meet Bob, he's your uncle.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.845
Oh, and, um,

27:47.080 --> 27:48.525
you're welcome.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.242
And why should we believe anything
that you have to say?

27:52.840 --> 27:54.410
You, halo,

27:54.760 --> 27:56.603
do you sense I'm lying?

27:56.760 --> 27:58.603
My name is Castiel.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.648
And, no.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.451
But the truth can be situational.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.681
Oh, I do enjoy an angel.

28:12.120 --> 28:14.964
But, I understand your hesitation.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.646
You haven't exactly seen us at our best.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.808
Lady Bevell is a bit

28:20.360 --> 28:22.567
- excitable.
- She tried to kill us.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.321
- Like I said, excitable.
- And you're better?

28:25.480 --> 28:28.484
I don't care about you one way
or the other. I'm not an ideologue.

28:28.680 --> 28:32.401
And all you wanna do is
help these American hunters

28:32.600 --> 28:34.762
to clear this country of monsters.

28:34.920 --> 28:38.003
We understand things are different here.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.969
<i>We're eager to collaborate.</i>

28:40.160 --> 28:42.845
The British Men of Letters
are centuries old, lads.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.088
We can offer expertise,

28:45.480 --> 28:47.323
weaponry, skills.

28:48.280 --> 28:49.566
Like we saw out on the road?

28:50.080 --> 28:52.321
I'm an artist, Mr. Winchester.

28:52.640 --> 28:55.610
I paint in many colors.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.688
Was that a grenade launcher?

28:58.920 --> 29:00.160
Quite.

29:01.160 --> 29:06.246
Our engineers have spent years
blending sorcery and technology.

29:06.680 --> 29:10.969
For instance, we don't always
decapitate vampires.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.204
Inefficient, really.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.522
Especially for large nests.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.001
We irradiate them.

29:18.680 --> 29:24.084
Reorder their DNA.
Their own blood becomes lethal to them.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.163
- Cool.
- Mmm.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.682
The toys are the fun part.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.369
Hyperbolic Pulse Generator.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.207
Exorcisms are unreliable.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.964
This device emits a force

29:42.120 --> 29:45.647
which drives the possessing demon
from the vessel.

29:46.600 --> 29:49.763
What about a possessing angel?

29:52.040 --> 29:55.249
And what might you boys be working on?

29:56.000 --> 29:59.163
Well, you want us to trust you?
You're gonna have to trust us first.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.610
And that means?

30:03.720 --> 30:07.441
So, you're gonna pop Lucifer
out of the President with that.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.771
I hope so.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.088
Otherwise we're all dead.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.249
Then Rowena zaps him back to the Cage.
Of course, we gotta get him here, first.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.562
Yeah. We need to get a hold of this

30:18.720 --> 30:22.088
secret girlfriend Crowley found out about,
this Kelly.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.848
<i>Of course, she's in that mansion
with the President,</i>

30:25.000 --> 30:27.401
which is guarded like a fortress.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.247
Only one of us
has a chance of getting in there.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.921
Bollocks.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.845
Yes, I'm pregnant.

30:42.080 --> 30:43.969
Well, I don't know when, Sheri!

30:44.120 --> 30:46.771
I don't know how, I just know that I am.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.246
CROWLEY: <i>Hello, darling.</i>

30:51.480 --> 30:53.323
This is going to sting a bit.

30:56.440 --> 30:59.603
No, no, you're making it up.
It's impossible.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.446
Well, to be fair, so is teleporting,

31:03.640 --> 31:05.881
but, ta-da.

31:07.600 --> 31:08.886
Who are you people?

31:09.040 --> 31:10.166
Well, dear,

31:10.440 --> 31:13.125
I'm a witch, he's an angel.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.610
And I'm the King of Hell.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.770
- Oh, God!
- No, actually, he left.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.809
Okay, guys, not helping.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.327
You can't. He's the President.

31:26.480 --> 31:28.369
He was, but now...

31:29.640 --> 31:31.324
Tell me he hasn't been acting different.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.285
- Jeff's been under a lot of stress, he...
- CROWLEY: <i>Wrong.</i>

31:34.440 --> 31:35.726
He's the Devil.

31:35.880 --> 31:39.441
- Horns, pitchfork, the whole nine.
- Crowley, still not helping.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.367
Listen, we know
what we're talking about, here.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.409
We have been on Lucifer's trail
for a long time.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.329
And we know you're pregnant.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.170
<i>With his child.</i>

31:49.320 --> 31:51.004
That's, that's... You're lying.

31:53.080 --> 31:56.129
The thing inside you, it's unholy.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.601
- It's an abomination.
- That's...

32:02.920 --> 32:04.251
Place your hand here.

32:30.760 --> 32:33.491
No. No.

32:33.960 --> 32:35.371
Does he even know you're knocked up?

32:36.040 --> 32:37.201
Yes.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.571
He said he was thrilled.

32:39.720 --> 32:43.361
He said it was the only time
he ever created anything.

32:45.680 --> 32:46.681
Kelly,

32:48.360 --> 32:49.850
we need your help.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.040
"Well, I grant a full pardon..."

32:58.560 --> 33:00.847
"To Charles Manson."

33:06.560 --> 33:09.131
- Kelly?
- KELLY: <i>I need to see you right away.</i>

33:09.280 --> 33:10.406
<i>It's urgent.</i>

33:39.680 --> 33:41.648
Sir, we agreed to keep this small,
like you asked.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.928
We're gonna go inside
and run a quick sweep.

33:44.200 --> 33:45.565
Absolutely.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.611
Wouldn't want anything happening to me.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.360
Miss Kline.

34:24.159 --> 34:26.208
There's no one in here but Kelly.

34:26.480 --> 34:27.641
Go wait in your car.

34:31.239 --> 34:32.605
It's clear.

34:33.679 --> 34:35.011
<i>Let's go.</i>

34:51.080 --> 34:54.687
There's no one in there but Kelly.
We'll wait in the car.

35:06.560 --> 35:07.846
Kelly.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.849
Kelly, what's wrong?

35:18.640 --> 35:20.688
I told you on the phone.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.288
I can't have this baby.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.967
I'm afraid I'll have to insist.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.081
Sam.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.926
We've done this dance so many times.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.160
Sam!

36:08.320 --> 36:09.401
Rowena! Now!

36:32.760 --> 36:34.444
This isn't over, Sam!

36:34.600 --> 36:36.125
Go to Hell!

37:18.520 --> 37:21.000
He's alive. He won't remember a thing.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.810
Jeff. Oh, my God.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.971
Jeff?

37:28.520 --> 37:29.965
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, you gotta go.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.201
Get her out of here.

37:31.360 --> 37:34.091
Go. Kelly, you gotta go. Go.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.121
We got him.

37:49.640 --> 37:50.880
We got Lucifer.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.445
Mr. President?

38:09.040 --> 38:11.964
Okay. All right. Take it easy, tiger.

38:13.360 --> 38:14.850
AGENT: <i>Mr. President?</i>

38:16.000 --> 38:18.207
<i>On your feet! Hands on your heads!</i>

38:18.440 --> 38:19.930
- Hands behind your heads!
- Okay, listen,

38:20.080 --> 38:22.208
- we were just trying to help...
- Shut up!

38:23.880 --> 38:26.121
You're under arrest for
the attempted assassination

38:26.320 --> 38:29.210
of the President of the United States.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.848
Sorry, I just, I need a minute.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.331
Kelly?

40:22.960 --> 40:24.849
Kelly, are you all right?

40:32.120 --> 40:34.248
Kelly?

40:36.160 --> 40:38.322
- Hello?
- Castiel?

40:39.240 --> 40:40.480
I can't do it.

40:41.520 --> 40:42.851
Kelly...

40:43.080 --> 40:45.162
I can feel it inside me.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.251
- I'm its mother.
- Kelly, you listen to me.

40:48.480 --> 40:49.811
This is not a baby.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.201
This is the spawn of Lucifer.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.890
It's my child.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.043
No, no! Kelly? You...
