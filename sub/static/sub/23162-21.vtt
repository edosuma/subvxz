00:01.652 --> 00:02.641
Hey!

00:05.756 --> 00:07.417
Don't you ever look before
you pull out into traffic?

00:07.491 --> 00:10.858
Well, I didn't realize I'd
be pulling into the lndy 500.

00:11.996 --> 00:15.261
They want something that you have
and I want to know what it is.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.492
Don't you have a gun?

00:17.568 --> 00:19.001
Why do I have to wear the wig?

00:19.070 --> 00:20.662
Rick, it's only
for five minutes.

00:20.738 --> 00:22.797
How do you figure
this stuff out?

00:22.874 --> 00:24.398
Logic and intuition.

00:24.475 --> 00:25.533
Blind luck.

02:45.596 --> 02:47.325
Hey! Stop him!

02:48.399 --> 02:49.457
Stop him!

02:58.442 --> 03:00.069
This way. Quick.

03:29.473 --> 03:30.497
Whatever.

03:30.574 --> 03:33.441
Perhaps it would be more
practical if you spoke English.

03:34.245 --> 03:35.234
Oh!

03:35.913 --> 03:37.505
You speak English.

03:38.716 --> 03:41.344
Well, I really didn't get
a good look at him,

03:41.419 --> 03:43.649
but I think he was short
and he had kind of blue...

03:43.721 --> 03:45.245
What was taken?

03:45.890 --> 03:49.053
My camera case.
My absolute favorite camera.

03:49.126 --> 03:52.186
My dad gave it to me when I was 16,
on my sixteenth birthday. It was so...

03:52.263 --> 03:54.458
Money, passport?

03:54.632 --> 03:57.795
No. No, no, no. But the case,
it was hand-tooled.

03:57.868 --> 04:00.234
You know, I'm never going to find
another one like it anywhere, I know.

04:00.304 --> 04:01.362
It was really
hard to...

04:01.439 --> 04:03.771
Was there anything else
of value in the case?

04:03.841 --> 04:06.742
No, I told you.
The camera.

04:07.345 --> 04:12.408
Something else perhaps someone
might want to steal. Like drugs?

04:13.417 --> 04:16.853
Of course not. Just the case.

04:20.791 --> 04:22.258
Oh, God.

04:23.194 --> 04:25.856
These. These. No.
Nothing else. Nothing.

04:29.433 --> 04:30.832
You don't want to
miss your plane, mademoiselle.

04:30.901 --> 04:33.028
If you will be so kind as to give
me your name and where you live,

04:33.104 --> 04:35.538
we can send it to you
should it be recovered.

04:35.606 --> 04:39.235
Shelly Faraday.
301 Punahou Street.

04:40.111 --> 04:41.544
Honolulu. Hawaii.

04:44.949 --> 04:48.350
There are some things
in life you just can't escape.

04:48.419 --> 04:52.287
Sooner or later you have to get
things like childhood vaccinations.

04:52.656 --> 04:54.920
And there's that first trip
to the dentist.

04:54.992 --> 04:58.951
And, at least in my case, that
first visit to the school principal.

04:59.230 --> 05:01.562
But none of these things
holds a candle

05:01.632 --> 05:04.795
to one of life's most
unpleasant certainties.

05:04.869 --> 05:07.667
Everyone somehow, somewhere,

05:07.738 --> 05:11.174
has to accept an award
in front of people.

05:11.242 --> 05:12.937
At least once in his life.

05:14.111 --> 05:15.942
Higgins.
Go away.

05:17.515 --> 05:19.949
You're ruining
Caldwell's shot.

05:20.017 --> 05:22.850
I can't ruin anybody's shot,
they can't hear me.

05:23.687 --> 05:25.279
Oh, you know,
my uncle Tom used to do that,

05:25.356 --> 05:28.348
except he did it with tequila and lemon.
You know...

05:28.426 --> 05:30.553
What is it?
What do you want?

05:30.628 --> 05:32.095
The cat speech is today.

05:32.163 --> 05:33.187
The what?

05:33.264 --> 05:35.562
The cat speech,
for Agatha's cat.

05:35.633 --> 05:37.225
What on Earth
are you talking about?

05:37.301 --> 05:39.292
The Cat Admirers
and Trainers Society.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.702
You know, I mean, it started
about a week ago,

05:41.772 --> 05:44.536
the day we had
those heavy rains.

05:44.608 --> 05:46.735
Well, there was a cat
in the tidal pool.

05:46.877 --> 05:49.607
Now, I don't know how it got
there... Magnum, for God's sake,

05:49.680 --> 05:51.307
get to the point.

05:51.782 --> 05:53.716
The point is somehow...

05:54.685 --> 05:56.050
Somehow...

05:56.120 --> 06:00.318
Agatha found out that I saved the cat,
and her cat people

06:00.391 --> 06:02.416
voted me Cat Lover
of the Month.

06:02.493 --> 06:06.156
And now I have to give a speech and
I just wondered if you'd listen to it

06:06.230 --> 06:08.460
to see if it was okay because
I'm a little nervous,

06:08.532 --> 06:10.796
and since you're not doing
anything real important...

06:10.868 --> 06:12.233
Not important?

06:12.303 --> 06:14.669
This is the fist time in the
long history of the game

06:14.738 --> 06:16.603
that those of us on
this side of the world

06:16.674 --> 06:19.438
can observe the snooker championships
on that side of the world,

06:19.510 --> 06:23.037
and you want me to squander this
opportunity to hear some speech about cats?

06:23.113 --> 06:26.446
Okay. Okay, I didn't realize
it was such a big deal.

06:28.385 --> 06:32.617
I'll wait until this incredibly
exciting moment is over.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.468
I have time. I can wait.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.001
Mr. Teasdale is
looking for the top right-hand corner.

06:56.981 --> 06:59.973
"Thank you, Agatha,
and thank you all for this honor."

07:00.050 --> 07:02.211
"Thank you, all of you,
for this honor."

07:02.353 --> 07:05.379
"Thank you, Agatha,
and thank you for the..." No.

07:06.390 --> 07:10.622
"Thank you, Agatha and thank you,
all of you, for this wonderful honor.

07:11.462 --> 07:13.692
"l can't really take
all the credit for..."

07:13.764 --> 07:15.925
Magnum, for the last time...

07:16.667 --> 07:18.066
What a shot!

07:18.602 --> 07:19.967
What? Who?

07:21.906 --> 07:25.467
And a brilliant end
to the frame for Mr. Caldwell.

07:27.411 --> 07:28.708
The interval.

07:28.779 --> 07:32.112
Great! "Thank you, Agatha.
Thank you, all of you..." No. No. No.

07:32.182 --> 07:34.082
I barely have enough time
to brew another cup of tea

07:34.151 --> 07:36.312
before the finalists
return to the table.

07:36.387 --> 07:37.581
You're the one who
rescued the cat,

07:37.655 --> 07:39.748
you're the one who, therefore,
must suffer the consequences.

07:39.823 --> 07:40.812
Good day.

07:40.925 --> 07:43.553
Okay, okay. I didn't realize
you were so addicted to pool.

07:43.627 --> 07:44.685
It's not pool.

07:44.762 --> 07:46.195
Billiards.
Snooker.

07:46.263 --> 07:47.821
Snooker.
"Snooker."

07:47.898 --> 07:49.661
"Snooker"!

07:49.733 --> 07:52.702
And believe it or not, there are
still some aspects of my personality

07:52.770 --> 07:54.067
about which you have
no knowledge.

07:54.138 --> 07:56.038
For the last time, go.

07:56.907 --> 08:00.343
Okay, fine, but you're missing an
excellent chance to correct my grammar

08:00.411 --> 08:02.311
and ridicule my syntax.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.537
Oh, Magnum, wait.

08:04.615 --> 08:06.480
I knew you'd change your mind.

08:06.550 --> 08:08.450
"Thank you, Agatha, and thank you,
all of you..." Someone...

08:08.519 --> 08:11.784
Someone, a young lady, quite
distressed by the tone of her voice,

08:11.855 --> 08:13.345
has been trying to reach you.

08:13.424 --> 08:14.982
She says her name
is Shelly Faraday.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.686
She's called all morning
while you were out,

08:16.760 --> 08:17.988
but you left your
answering machine...

08:18.062 --> 08:19.757
I left my answering machine
off again. I know.

08:19.830 --> 08:24.665
This may be too much to ask, but for the
next 48 hours I want to be left alone.

08:25.603 --> 08:26.831
Shelly Faraday?

08:26.904 --> 08:28.166
Correct.

08:31.642 --> 08:34.702
Here we are at the
start of the twentieth frame.

08:35.813 --> 08:38.714
Willy Teasdale
lines up for the break,

08:41.385 --> 08:44.843
and the crowd settles down.

08:50.628 --> 08:54.189
During the height of the storm,
when he saw that Tybalt

08:54.264 --> 08:57.495
was drowning in the deepest
portion of the tidal pool,

08:57.568 --> 09:00.264
he responded
without hesitation,

09:00.337 --> 09:03.465
diving into the tidal pool,
fully dressed,

09:03.674 --> 09:06.700
without regard
to his personal safety,

09:06.910 --> 09:10.243
and rescued Tybalt from
what we could describe,

09:10.314 --> 09:13.647
without exaggeration,
as a certain death.

09:26.230 --> 09:29.131
Hi, this is Thomas Magnum.
I am unable to take your call right now

09:29.199 --> 09:31.599
but if you'll leave a message
I'll get back to you. Thanks.

09:32.736 --> 09:36.365
This is Shelly Faraday again.
Where are you?

11:20.711 --> 11:22.770
And so, Thomas Magnum,

11:22.846 --> 11:25.474
the Cat Admirers
and Trainers Society

11:25.549 --> 11:30.009
is proud to present you with this
Cat Lover of the Month award.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.361
Thank you, Agatha.

11:46.537 --> 11:48.232
And thank you, Tybalt.

11:49.873 --> 11:53.434
And thank you, all of you,
for this wonderful honor.

11:54.044 --> 11:58.413
You know, I really can't take all
the credit for saving TybaIt's life.

11:59.249 --> 12:00.546
Whichever one
this happens to be.

12:00.617 --> 12:03.677
Oh, I'd say five or six,
from the look of him.

12:04.922 --> 12:07.755
Sorry, Tybby.
I didn't mean to be catty.

12:08.091 --> 12:14.326
No, I'd say it was a series of
catastrophic events that catapulted me

12:14.398 --> 12:16.696
into this category
of cat hero.

12:21.004 --> 12:24.235
Anyway I never had
a cat for a pet.

12:24.308 --> 12:27.539
I never did. I don't know what
happened but I had this...

12:27.611 --> 12:34.449
This cousin, Claude,
and he had this long-haired Persian.

12:35.252 --> 12:37.482
And we used to play
this great game with him

12:37.554 --> 12:40.921
on the kitchen linoleum.
We called it "spin the cat."

12:43.360 --> 12:45.760
I mean, you take the cat
and you'd spin him around

12:45.829 --> 12:47.626
about eight or ten times,

12:47.698 --> 12:52.635
and then you'd just slide
him down the kitchen floor

12:52.703 --> 12:54.568
all the way to the door.

12:55.772 --> 12:59.936
You should see the cat when he tries
to walk back to you. It's great!

13:05.682 --> 13:08.947
Oh, it didn't hurt the cat.
I mean, he...

13:09.019 --> 13:10.987
No, he liked the game.

13:11.054 --> 13:13.284
No, he... Honest. He loved it.
He loved it.

13:13.357 --> 13:16.918
He used to try to get us to
play it with him all the time.

13:24.034 --> 13:25.899
Then in high school...

13:26.270 --> 13:27.328
No.

13:30.107 --> 13:31.096
No.

14:06.877 --> 14:10.506
Well, I wouldn't feel
so badly, Mr. Magnum.

14:10.580 --> 14:13.777
Actually, parts of your speech
were quite amusing.

14:14.017 --> 14:16.679
Let's face it, Agatha.
It was a disaster.

14:16.753 --> 14:18.687
Well, look at it this way.

14:18.755 --> 14:23.783
Each person is only allotted so many times
to fall on their face in his lifetime.

14:23.860 --> 14:25.760
Now you have one less.

14:28.198 --> 14:29.187
Thanks.

14:43.413 --> 14:44.402
Hey!

14:46.383 --> 14:47.680
Mr. Magnum!

14:49.686 --> 14:50.914
Agatha!

15:00.263 --> 15:03.289
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

15:03.767 --> 15:06.895
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's all
my fault. Please say you're all right.

15:06.970 --> 15:09.438
Are you all right? What the hell are
you doing? You could've killed us both!

15:09.506 --> 15:10.996
Well, I just looked away
for a minute, then realized...

15:11.074 --> 15:12.905
Do you see what you
did to my car?

15:12.976 --> 15:15.604
You should have your driver's
license permanently revoked!

15:15.679 --> 15:17.579
Oh, dear. Mr. Magnum.
Hey, I'm not entirely to blame.

15:17.647 --> 15:19.274
Don't you ever look before
you pull out into traffic?

15:19.349 --> 15:22.113
Well, I didn't realize I'd be
pulling into the lndy 500.

15:22.185 --> 15:25.177
Mr. Magnum... If you had any manners,
you might accept a lady's apology.

15:25.255 --> 15:27.223
Manners! Manners!
Thomas!

15:27.824 --> 15:30.224
I believe
I've broken my leg.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.573
I'm coming with you
to the hospital.

15:44.641 --> 15:47.041
I wouldn't hear of it.
I'll be fine.

15:47.110 --> 15:50.602
No. No, it's my fault. I want to stay
with you until I know you're all right.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.648
I survived the blitz.

15:52.716 --> 15:55.014
What's a little broken ankle?

15:55.085 --> 15:57.952
Besides, you need
to get cracking.

15:58.021 --> 15:59.682
The trail is getting cold.

15:59.756 --> 16:02.691
The suspects are
slipping out of your grasp.

16:02.859 --> 16:05.054
Don't worry, Agatha.
I'm going to find them.

16:05.128 --> 16:08.427
And I'll get to the hospital
as soon as I can, then.

16:08.498 --> 16:13.663
You may be a terrible speechmaker, Mr.
Magnum, but you're still a hero to me.

16:26.416 --> 16:27.781
Mr. Magnum?

16:28.351 --> 16:30.319
Look, I'm really sorry about
what happened. I really...

16:30.387 --> 16:32.321
Let's just exchange
driver's license information.

16:32.389 --> 16:33.413
I have it right here.

16:33.490 --> 16:36.948
And your insurance agent can talk to
my insurance agent and they can...

16:37.027 --> 16:38.153
This is expired!

16:38.228 --> 16:40.719
What?
Your driver's license is expired!

16:40.797 --> 16:43.595
It must've happened in Europe,
while I was there.

16:43.667 --> 16:46.295
Now, don't worry. I'll take care of
any of the damages. Just tell me...

16:46.369 --> 16:47.666
This is ruined.
This is ruined.

16:47.737 --> 16:49.967
Don't worry about it. I told you I
would pay for any of the damages.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.871
You just tell me how much
and where and when and...

16:51.942 --> 16:53.842
Where to, bro?
Lefty's.

16:54.311 --> 16:56.779
For this car?
You're the boss.

16:59.349 --> 17:01.783
Do you have a number
where you can be reached?

17:01.852 --> 17:03.376
You're not leaving.
I have to talk to you!

17:03.453 --> 17:05.079
Now, look.
Wait, Miss... What?

17:05.155 --> 17:07.385
Faraday. Shelly Faraday.
Miss. Faraday, look I have...

17:07.457 --> 17:09.516
You've been calling me.

17:09.593 --> 17:10.651
Yes.

17:10.727 --> 17:12.092
This wasn't an accident.

17:12.162 --> 17:14.153
No! I mean, not all of it.

17:14.231 --> 17:19.031
I didn't mean for this to happen and I
certainly never meant for anyone to get hurt.

17:19.102 --> 17:21.161
I was trying to get in touch
with you so that I could tell...

17:21.238 --> 17:22.637
I've gotta take my car in.

17:22.705 --> 17:25.334
I'll drive you and we can
discuss the case in the car.

17:25.407 --> 17:29.538
I don't... I don't want to discuss
it in the car or anywhere else.

17:29.613 --> 17:30.875
You don't even know
what it's about.

17:30.981 --> 17:32.346
It doesn't matter
what it's about.

17:32.415 --> 17:35.441
I've gotta find the men who
almost ran down my friend Agatha.

17:35.519 --> 17:37.248
That is going to take up
most of my time.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.015
So I'm sorry,
I cannot take your case.

17:39.089 --> 17:40.852
The men were chasing me.

17:40.924 --> 17:42.721
I'm taking your case.

17:47.998 --> 17:49.966
What makes you think
you're being followed?

17:50.033 --> 17:51.125
Nice.

17:51.234 --> 17:52.701
Your niece?

17:52.969 --> 17:55.369
No. In Nice, in France.

17:56.106 --> 17:58.904
Yes, I know where Nice is.

18:01.244 --> 18:03.269
So, these guys were
following you in France?

18:03.346 --> 18:05.644
Well, I'm not sure they're
the exact guys.

18:05.715 --> 18:07.444
That doesn't work.

18:07.817 --> 18:09.910
And I'm not sure they were
following me there exactly,

18:09.986 --> 18:12.784
but I'm absolutely positive
that they're connected.

18:12.856 --> 18:14.255
Connected to what?

18:14.658 --> 18:18.059
Well, that's what I'm not sure of.
That's why I need to hire you.

18:18.128 --> 18:21.325
You see, it all happened the
last day I was in Monte Carlo.

18:21.398 --> 18:24.663
Somebody broke into my hotel room.
But they didn't take anything.

18:24.734 --> 18:27.430
And I thought that was
really suspicious.

18:27.504 --> 18:28.869
But the hotel management...

18:28.939 --> 18:32.602
You know how they are over there, about
rumors, about break-ins, and all that...

18:32.676 --> 18:35.042
You saw it was those two guys?

18:35.111 --> 18:36.578
No. I didn't see anybody.

18:36.646 --> 18:38.978
But I did see the kid
who stole my camera case.

18:39.049 --> 18:41.040
I thought you said
they didn't take anything.

18:41.117 --> 18:44.052
At the hotel.
They didn't take anything at the hotel.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.918
But then at the airport,
this kid stole my camera case.

18:46.990 --> 18:50.756
Now, I didn't get a real good look
at him, but if I saw him in a lineup,

18:50.827 --> 18:53.057
I am sure
I would recognize him.

18:53.330 --> 18:55.958
Oh? And he was with
these two guys?

18:56.733 --> 18:57.757
No!

19:01.538 --> 19:04.598
Miss Faraday, what makes you
think you're being followed?

19:06.710 --> 19:09.907
Hey, wait. Where are you going?
What are you doing?

19:09.980 --> 19:11.971
You're supposed to be
taking me to the garage.

19:12.048 --> 19:14.642
Well, I just have to make a little
stop first. I didn't think you'd mind.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.549
Mind? Mind?
Why should I mind?

19:16.620 --> 19:18.485
I have this fashion layout...
First you destroy my car.

19:18.555 --> 19:20.750
...I have to drop over to
Vanden's department store by 1:30.

19:20.824 --> 19:22.223
And then you trick me

19:22.292 --> 19:24.385
into riding with you...
They absolutely have to have it today.

19:24.461 --> 19:27.589
...with some ridiculous story about some
bad guys chasing you all over Europe.

19:27.664 --> 19:30.565
Just France. I didn't say
anything about the rest of Europe.

19:47.884 --> 19:49.977
What is it you really want?

19:50.487 --> 19:52.887
If you don't want to help me, you
should've said so in the first place.

19:52.956 --> 19:54.116
I did.

19:55.191 --> 19:57.853
I don't even think those guys
were following you at all.

19:57.927 --> 19:59.019
What do you think
they were doing?

19:59.095 --> 20:00.790
That's what I intend
to find out.

20:00.864 --> 20:01.922
Fine.

20:01.998 --> 20:03.192
Fine.

20:07.437 --> 20:10.133
Let me just drop this layout off
and I'll take you to your garage!

20:10.206 --> 20:12.504
Don't bother.
I'll take the bus.

20:12.842 --> 20:14.104
Suit yourself.

20:14.444 --> 20:15.433
I will.

20:18.081 --> 20:19.070
Fine.

20:34.998 --> 20:35.987
Oh!

20:36.266 --> 20:37.893
I've got something!

20:41.404 --> 20:43.736
Play him out,
give him some line.

20:44.207 --> 20:45.367
Give him some line.

20:45.442 --> 20:47.307
He's gonna get away.

20:47.377 --> 20:48.674
No, he's not.

20:50.246 --> 20:53.682
Come on, we've gotta wear him out.
Now reel him in.

20:53.783 --> 20:54.909
Reel him in.
Good. Good. Good.

20:54.984 --> 20:58.579
Oh! I saw him!
Did you see him?

20:58.855 --> 20:59.844
Yeah.

21:01.091 --> 21:04.151
I saw him on a plate with
some almandine sauce.

21:06.763 --> 21:08.321
We're not home!

21:15.472 --> 21:17.064
He got away!

21:18.775 --> 21:20.800
This better be good news.

21:26.716 --> 21:27.705
Hello!

21:27.817 --> 21:29.375
T.C., how are you, buddy?

21:29.452 --> 21:32.683
I just lost a world record catch
to listen to "How are you, buddy"?

21:32.756 --> 21:33.848
Well, if you're busy...

21:33.923 --> 21:35.288
Yeah, I'm busy.

21:35.358 --> 21:36.825
Well, it won't take long, see.

21:36.893 --> 21:39.191
I just called to tell you I had
the Ferrari towed to Lefty's,

21:39.262 --> 21:40.889
and I told him to put
the repairs on your bill.

21:40.964 --> 21:42.261
But don't worry,
I'm good for it.

21:42.332 --> 21:44.163
You what?
T.C.!

21:44.434 --> 21:45.992
We got another bite!

21:46.069 --> 21:47.058
Great!

21:47.137 --> 21:48.866
I knew you'd understand.
Thanks, T.C.

21:51.608 --> 21:53.132
Help! Help!

21:58.882 --> 22:01.077
When it beeps, speak, ciao!

22:02.252 --> 22:04.550
Rick, it's Thomas.
Look, I really need your help.

22:04.621 --> 22:06.646
You've gotta track down
a car for me.

22:06.723 --> 22:11.023
I didn't get a license number,
but it's a late model domestic sedan.

22:11.094 --> 22:13.858
It's brown, I think,
I'm pretty sure it's a rental,

22:13.930 --> 22:17.764
and it probably has a streak of
red paint where it hit the Ferrari.

22:17.867 --> 22:19.858
I think I found it. Thanks.

22:37.220 --> 22:39.586
"RTO 456."

23:51.060 --> 23:52.049
Shh.

23:53.062 --> 23:56.122
Your friends from Monte...
Monte Carlo are here.

23:56.199 --> 23:57.188
Where?

23:57.700 --> 23:58.689
Arrest them.

23:58.768 --> 24:00.759
I can't arrest them. As soon as
you're safe, I'll come back...

24:00.837 --> 24:02.532
We can't leave them here.
They'll get away.

24:02.605 --> 24:05.233
Will you trust me on this one?
I know what I'm doing.

24:08.912 --> 24:10.140
Come on.

24:11.614 --> 24:12.603
There she is.

24:20.657 --> 24:21.817
My shoe.

24:23.192 --> 24:24.454
Leave it!

24:28.331 --> 24:32.199
These are Charles Jourdan. Do you have
any idea how expensive they are wholesale?

24:34.437 --> 24:35.665
Pull your gun.

24:35.738 --> 24:37.228
Just get to the car!

24:37.307 --> 24:38.365
Don't you have a gun?

24:38.441 --> 24:39.567
Keep moving.

24:39.642 --> 24:41.439
You don't have a gun?

24:43.680 --> 24:45.614
Give me the keys.
Oh, I can drive.

24:45.682 --> 24:48.082
I've seen how you drive.
Just give me the keys.

24:48.151 --> 24:50.244
What kind of private eye
doesn't carry a gun?

24:50.320 --> 24:51.878
It's private investigator.

24:51.955 --> 24:53.684
And the kind that
doesn't think he'll need one,

24:53.756 --> 24:57.192
'cause all he planned on doing all
day was give a speech for cats.

25:00.630 --> 25:03.098
Oh, my...
Why didn't you tell me?

25:48.559 --> 25:51.653
Miss Faraday,
what are they after?

25:53.731 --> 25:55.392
You know something
you're not telling me.

25:55.466 --> 25:59.334
See, they had a good clear shot
at you and they didn't take it.

25:59.403 --> 26:01.598
That must mean that
they want something

26:01.672 --> 26:04.607
that you have and I
want to know what it is.

26:06.277 --> 26:10.976
Mr. Magnum, do you know what it's like living
in someone else's shadow your whole life?

26:11.115 --> 26:15.347
I hardly think this is the time to hear
your life story. I mean, we have...

26:15.419 --> 26:16.681
Faraday?

26:19.190 --> 26:21.385
Your father is Dutch Faraday!

26:22.459 --> 26:24.154
The Dutch Faraday?

26:25.229 --> 26:27.424
Yeah, I know.
You love his work.

26:27.498 --> 26:28.863
You've studied his techniques.

26:28.933 --> 26:31.231
You probably have
his book of nudes.

26:31.302 --> 26:34.362
No, as a matter of fact,
I have his book on movie queens.

26:34.438 --> 26:37.896
Oh, so you wonder how he captures
their souls so magnificently

26:37.975 --> 26:40.466
on just a little strip of
petroleum product, right?

26:40.544 --> 26:44.207
So, you think those guys are
connected to Dutch Faraday?

26:45.516 --> 26:49.316
You would think, at least,
this experience could be my own.

26:49.386 --> 26:51.911
Well, I just thought that
you might have something

26:51.989 --> 26:54.480
of your father's that somebody
might want to steal.

26:54.558 --> 26:55.616
No.

26:55.693 --> 26:59.254
I have something of mine that
someone might want to steal.

27:00.331 --> 27:01.320
What?

27:01.966 --> 27:03.365
My book.

27:04.835 --> 27:06.063
What book?

27:06.136 --> 27:09.162
The one I'm writing.
The one I was researching in Europe.

27:09.240 --> 27:12.141
When this book comes out,
people are going to have to acknowledge,

27:12.209 --> 27:15.804
finally, that Shelly Faraday is
a major talent in her own right.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.973
Not just Dutch Faraday's
daughter.

27:18.048 --> 27:20.949
Obviously, somebody doesn't
want to see that happen.

27:21.018 --> 27:25.148
Someone couldn't bear to see Dutch
Faraday topple from his pedestal.

27:26.090 --> 27:30.789
And that someone is trying to steal this
film before I get it to my publisher.

27:33.097 --> 27:34.826
What kind of book?

27:35.566 --> 27:36.931
Road signs.

27:37.568 --> 27:38.557
Road signs?

27:38.636 --> 27:39.864
Road signs.

27:40.804 --> 27:44.399
Oh, the emotional, spiritual,
psychological road signs

27:44.475 --> 27:47.171
that human beings encounter
during their lifetimes.

27:47.244 --> 27:48.233
No.

27:48.412 --> 27:51.404
Stop. Go. Yield.
Rough road ahead. Road signs.

27:51.749 --> 27:52.875
Road signs?

27:52.950 --> 27:54.144
Exactly.

27:57.588 --> 27:59.078
What's so funny?

28:00.024 --> 28:04.484
Nothing! I mean, why would anybody want
to steal photographs of road signs?

28:04.561 --> 28:08.053
Why would anyone want to look
at photographs of road signs?

28:08.132 --> 28:10.896
Road signs are
the windows of the world.

28:11.001 --> 28:13.936
A chance for us to get
closer together, globally.

28:19.376 --> 28:21.037
It's not so funny.

28:22.246 --> 28:24.214
I've hurt your feelings.

28:24.448 --> 28:25.847
No, you haven't.

28:25.916 --> 28:28.714
Well, that's good. I mean,
'cause I don't want to.

28:29.453 --> 28:33.446
I don't... I think it's great that
you're putting a book together.

28:33.524 --> 28:35.321
No matter what it is.

28:37.094 --> 28:39.119
You don't think that's
what they're after?

28:39.196 --> 28:41.790
Oh, hey, what the heck?
Maybe it is.

28:41.865 --> 28:45.323
I mean, we've got nothing else
to go on. Maybe it is.

28:47.004 --> 28:50.872
Well, I didn't want to trust
a commercial lab with these.

28:56.680 --> 28:59.478
We can develop
these ourselves.

28:59.817 --> 29:01.182
Do you have a darkroom?

29:06.490 --> 29:09.152
If it's your darkroom,
why do we have to be quiet?

29:09.226 --> 29:10.693
Well, there's someone else
who lives here,

29:10.761 --> 29:15.425
and he's kind of a camera buff and he
asks me for pointers from time to time.

29:15.499 --> 29:16.625
I don't mind helping him out,

29:16.700 --> 29:19.498
but I don't think we have the time
right now to answer all his...

29:19.570 --> 29:21.401
Oh, my God!

29:21.805 --> 29:22.897
Higgins!

29:27.277 --> 29:28.266
Higgins?

29:28.345 --> 29:30.643
I hope you have a good explanation
for this unwarranted intrusion.

29:30.714 --> 29:32.909
You have destroyed the
negative of what is perhaps

29:32.983 --> 29:34.450
the finest thirty-five
millimeter shot

29:34.518 --> 29:36.816
ever taken from a large screen
projected video image.

29:36.887 --> 29:37.911
Snooker?

29:37.988 --> 29:39.046
"Snooker."

29:39.123 --> 29:41.182
Caldwell's frame-winning shot,
to be precise.

29:41.258 --> 29:42.555
Lost forever.

29:42.626 --> 29:46.357
What possible feeble, lame excuse can
you have for such a reprehensible act?

29:46.430 --> 29:50.366
Somebody's trying to kill me. Our only
clue to him could be on this film.

29:51.902 --> 29:52.891
Oh.

29:54.938 --> 29:57.338
What is it, exactly,
we're looking for?

29:57.408 --> 29:58.534
I'm not sure.

29:58.609 --> 30:02.739
Wow, these are much better than
I thought they would be. Much better.

30:02.980 --> 30:04.277
Road signs?

30:05.783 --> 30:08.081
"Windows to the world,"
Higgins.

30:09.453 --> 30:14.390
You destroyed my photograph of
Caldwell's perfect shot for road signs?

30:14.558 --> 30:16.788
Wait, wait! Look, look!

30:21.732 --> 30:23.825
Did you notice these men
when you took the picture?

30:23.901 --> 30:26.563
No, not really. 'Cause I always
knew I could crop them out.

30:26.637 --> 30:28.298
Do you have any
idea who they are?

30:28.372 --> 30:29.498
No.

30:29.573 --> 30:31.040
Solis.

30:32.409 --> 30:33.933
Carlos Solis.

30:37.448 --> 30:39.245
Who is Carlos Solis?

30:39.850 --> 30:40.942
Who is Carlos Solis?

30:41.018 --> 30:43.145
Well know racketeer
and money launderer.

30:43.220 --> 30:44.915
He was murdered
early last week.

30:44.988 --> 30:46.250
Murdered?

30:47.024 --> 30:49.288
The Gazette carried the story.

30:53.263 --> 30:54.560
Here it is.

30:57.201 --> 31:00.068
"Carlos Solis
shot execution style.

31:00.304 --> 31:03.899
"Body found on side of road four
kilometers west of Cap Ferrat."

31:03.974 --> 31:06.033
That's where
I took the photograph.

31:06.110 --> 31:09.944
"Authorities estimate the time of
death between 4 and 5 p.m. on Tuesday."

31:10.013 --> 31:12.140
Two hours after I was there!

31:13.817 --> 31:14.977
The other man killed him.

31:15.052 --> 31:17.953
Wait a minute, Shelly,
you're making a giant leap in logic.

31:18.021 --> 31:20.012
You can't prove
the other guy killed him.

31:20.090 --> 31:21.717
Then why is he after my film?

31:21.792 --> 31:23.987
We don't even know for sure if
he's the one who's after it.

31:24.194 --> 31:26.389
Well, it makes sense,
doesn't it?

31:26.463 --> 31:29.398
It does have a certain
crazy kind of logic to it.

31:29.466 --> 31:32.492
All right, what was Solis doing
that he didn't want photographed?

31:32.569 --> 31:34.696
Who is the other man?

31:36.340 --> 31:39.707
You know, if I didn't know better,
I'd say this guy looks like Owen Kirk, Higgins.

31:39.776 --> 31:42.210
Who's Owen Kirk? That's absolutely
beyond the realm of possibility.

31:42.279 --> 31:43.303
Yeah, I know.
Who's Owen Kirk?

31:43.380 --> 31:45.848
Owen Kirk was bald, he had a moustache
and he's been dead for five years.

31:45.916 --> 31:49.044
I didn't say it was Owen Kirk,
I just said it looked like him.

31:49.119 --> 31:50.780
Who's Owen Kirk?

31:50.854 --> 31:53.448
Five years ago, Owen Kirk
bilked 23 investors...

31:53.524 --> 31:54.650
Including Robin Masters.

31:54.725 --> 31:59.253
Including Robin Masters out of three million
dollars each on some hydrogen converter scam.

31:59.329 --> 32:00.421
And went into hiding?

32:00.497 --> 32:02.431
And died
in a fiery airplane crash.

32:02.499 --> 32:04.467
What if he didn't?
Just hear me out.

32:04.535 --> 32:07.231
If he didn't, he fooled everybody
and got away with the money.

32:08.605 --> 32:10.505
An absolutely
preposterous theory.

32:10.607 --> 32:12.074
It's time for the
30-second frame to start.

32:12.142 --> 32:13.302
It sure looks like him.

32:13.377 --> 32:15.868
Higgins, you do re-touch
work on your photographs?

32:15.946 --> 32:17.846
Absolutely not. That won't prove
anything. I can. I'd be glad to.

32:17.915 --> 32:19.473
Oh, great. That's great.

32:19.550 --> 32:21.108
We'll make this guy bald,

32:21.185 --> 32:23.312
you put a moustache in there and
Higgins and I can identify him.

32:23.387 --> 32:27.118
I'm not going to miss the 30-second
frame for some childish guessing game.

32:27.191 --> 32:30.592
I'm sure Robin would like to
know if Owen Kirk is still alive.

32:37.401 --> 32:38.732
No. A little fuller.

32:43.207 --> 32:44.435
My God.

32:45.776 --> 32:47.869
It's Owen Kirk.
We got him!

32:47.945 --> 32:51.142
I mean, it's not,
but it certainly looks like him.

32:51.949 --> 32:52.973
What do we do now?

32:53.050 --> 32:54.608
We call the FBl.
They're closed.

32:54.685 --> 32:57.051
So, first thing in the morning,
we take the photograph down,

32:57.120 --> 33:00.954
slap it on some agent's desk and
tell him we've found Owen Kirk.

33:05.596 --> 33:07.257
Owen Kirk is dead.

33:10.601 --> 33:12.899
I ought to know.
It was my case.

33:13.003 --> 33:16.564
That's what everyone thinks, but the
photograph proves he's still alive.

33:19.276 --> 33:20.709
I took that.

33:22.012 --> 33:23.946
It's very nice.
It's been re-touched.

33:24.014 --> 33:25.914
Just to prove
that it's Owen.

33:25.983 --> 33:28.110
You see, it's a part of
my series on road signs.

33:28.185 --> 33:32.679
I'm publishing a book. I'm going
to call it, Windows to the World.

33:34.024 --> 33:35.184
Road signs?

33:35.259 --> 33:36.248
Mmm-hmm.

33:36.793 --> 33:38.556
You two didn't happen
to have anything to do

33:38.629 --> 33:41.154
with the Howard Hughes
autobiography, did you?

33:41.231 --> 33:44.166
Of course not.
What kind of a crack is that?

33:45.702 --> 33:47.067
We get all kinds in here,
ma'am.

33:47.137 --> 33:48.263
Just wait a minute.

33:48.338 --> 33:51.330
I mean, we're not a couple of crackpots
trying to pull a fast one on you.

33:51.408 --> 33:54.138
We have evidence
that Owen Kirk is alive,

33:54.211 --> 33:56.441
and you know there is about 23
people who'd be real interested

33:56.546 --> 33:59.947
in knowing why you are not going to re-open
the case and try and get their money back.

34:00.017 --> 34:02.986
Come on, just give me one good reason
why you're just rushing us out of here

34:03.053 --> 34:04.987
instead of taking
this seriously.

34:05.055 --> 34:06.386
Dental records.

34:07.124 --> 34:11.958
The body we pulled out of that
airplane five years ago was Owen Kirk.

34:13.263 --> 34:16.164
These are the dental records
that proved it.

34:18.235 --> 34:20.293
Do they really prove it?

34:20.370 --> 34:22.132
Oh, they proved it
all right.

34:22.205 --> 34:25.231
Believe me, we were under
a microscope with this one.

34:25.976 --> 34:28.444
There were a lot of very wealthy,
very influential people

34:28.512 --> 34:31.275
who wanted to believe that
Owen Kirk was still alive.

34:31.348 --> 34:33.248
And that we
could find him.

34:37.353 --> 34:38.981
That's Owen Kirk.

34:40.556 --> 34:44.926
I have to admit that your photograph
does bear a slight resemblance, but...

34:45.262 --> 34:46.592
What if we find
more evidence?

34:46.663 --> 34:48.027
There is no more evidence.

34:48.098 --> 34:49.929
I mean, there's a lot of areas
that we haven't even...

34:50.000 --> 34:50.989
Sorry.

34:58.308 --> 34:59.741
Well, what do we do now?

34:59.810 --> 35:01.277
I'm not sure.

35:01.812 --> 35:04.303
Well, if he's not Owen Kirk,
what does he want with the photograph?

35:04.381 --> 35:05.871
I'm going to take you back
to Robin's Nest.

35:05.949 --> 35:09.976
See if Higgins can come up with any new
theories on the Owen Kirk look-alike.

35:10.053 --> 35:12.078
In the meantime,
I'm going to go see Agatha.

35:12.155 --> 35:14.180
Oh, do you think maybe
she saw something we missed?

35:14.257 --> 35:17.021
No, but I think she could use
some cheering up.

35:17.094 --> 35:18.083
Oh.

35:22.499 --> 35:25.798
Hi, Agatha.
I brought you some flowers.

35:26.903 --> 35:28.632
I see you already have some.

35:34.711 --> 35:36.406
I won't stay long.

35:36.913 --> 35:39.643
I know how those pain
killers can knock you out.

35:44.187 --> 35:46.121
These are all from Higgins!

35:47.958 --> 35:50.950
Yeah, I'm sure he would've
come by to see you himself,

35:51.027 --> 35:56.055
but he's all caught up
in his snooker championships.

35:58.868 --> 36:00.028
Yeah.

36:00.870 --> 36:04.169
You know, I remember one time when
I was just out of high school.

36:04.240 --> 36:08.142
We had this big pool
competition in Tidewater.

36:08.812 --> 36:10.973
And everybody was
just fascinated.

36:11.047 --> 36:13.242
They were just fascinated
with this new guy in town.

36:13.316 --> 36:14.442
He was a young kid.

36:14.517 --> 36:18.783
And he was absolutely
astounding with a pool cue.

36:19.456 --> 36:24.155
And the most amazing part of it
was he never tired out, ever.

36:24.794 --> 36:25.988
Yeah. Well, with good reason.

36:26.062 --> 36:29.793
See, it turned out that he
wasn't really a good pool player.

36:29.866 --> 36:32.232
He was two really
good pool players.

36:32.302 --> 36:34.270
He and his twin brother.

36:34.471 --> 36:36.564
And it was the scandal
of Tidewater.

36:36.640 --> 36:37.902
Brothers.

36:38.508 --> 36:39.702
Thank you, Agatha.

36:41.411 --> 36:42.400
I'll get that.

36:42.545 --> 36:43.671
Hello.

36:43.747 --> 36:46.978
The negatives and all the
prints for your friend.

36:47.050 --> 36:48.711
If you call the police,
she's dead!

36:48.785 --> 36:49.979
You have Shelly?

36:54.324 --> 36:56.417
Mr. Magnum. Is that you?

36:57.727 --> 36:58.887
Are you there?

36:58.995 --> 36:59.984
Agatha?

37:01.731 --> 37:07.670
I hope you'll forgive me. I'm afraid
I've turned into rather a bother.

37:11.307 --> 37:13.241
David Kirk,
Owen Kirk's brother.

37:13.309 --> 37:15.470
I can't believe
I didn't see it right away.

37:15.545 --> 37:17.172
Here's another one.

37:17.247 --> 37:19.715
"At the bankruptcy hearing,
David Kirk testified

37:19.783 --> 37:22.616
"that all of his brother's considerable
wealth had been spent on cars,

37:22.686 --> 37:24.244
"airplanes
and gambling debts.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.015
"David Kirk made
a good-faith offer

37:26.089 --> 37:27.681
"to pay off
all of his brother's creditors

37:27.757 --> 37:29.122
"at three cents
to the dollar."

37:29.192 --> 37:30.454
He sounds like
one of the good guys.

37:30.527 --> 37:33.052
Well, I'm sure that's what he wanted
it to sound like. Listen to this.

37:33.129 --> 37:37.190
"Also called to testify in the mysterious
disappearance of Owen's millions

37:37.267 --> 37:41.101
"were Martin Renfrew,
Alan Jenkins and Carlos Solis,

37:41.171 --> 37:43.639
"all of whom were reputed
to have had knowledge

37:43.707 --> 37:45.436
"of the whereabouts
of the fortune."

37:45.508 --> 37:48.033
And all of whom recently died
under mysterious circumstances.

37:48.111 --> 37:49.169
Exactly.

37:49.245 --> 37:52.578
So you think that they knew
where Kirk had stashed the money?

37:53.116 --> 37:55.050
Well, I think they were supposed
to get a cut of the money

37:55.118 --> 37:57.712
and David Kirk doesn't want to
share his brother's hidden wealth.

37:58.822 --> 38:00.722
That's fascinating.

38:02.292 --> 38:04.692
How do you figure
this stuff out?

38:05.095 --> 38:07.586
The usual means utilized by
detectives-for-hire, primarily...

38:07.664 --> 38:10.394
Deductive reasoning,
logic, and intuition.

38:10.467 --> 38:11.593
Blind luck.

38:12.235 --> 38:13.793
However, that's not
important right now.

38:13.870 --> 38:15.394
What is important
is that we implement the plan

38:15.472 --> 38:16.666
for Agatha's
immediate release.

38:16.740 --> 38:17.968
Exactly.

38:18.308 --> 38:21.835
Synchronize watches.
15:03.

38:22.879 --> 38:25.177
Well, I'm going, too.

38:25.248 --> 38:27.739
Shelly, we have been
through this a dozen times.

38:28.284 --> 38:29.717
So, you think you can
just go over there,

38:29.786 --> 38:32.516
hand over the negatives and
walk away with Miss Chumley?

38:32.856 --> 38:34.221
Don't you go to the movies?

38:34.290 --> 38:36.520
David Kirk is
going to kill you

38:36.593 --> 38:38.857
as soon as he is sure
he's got what he wants.

38:38.928 --> 38:41.453
And then he's going to
find me and kill me.

38:41.531 --> 38:43.692
He can't afford to let
any of us live.

38:43.767 --> 38:47.328
Exactly! That is why you're
going to call Agent Longdon.

38:47.403 --> 38:48.495
But l...

38:48.571 --> 38:50.869
At exactly 15:28.

38:51.241 --> 38:53.641
He won't believe me.
It's better that I go with you.

38:53.710 --> 38:55.507
Miss Faraday,
if you tell Agent Longdon

38:55.578 --> 38:57.273
exactly what I told you
to tell him...

38:57.347 --> 38:58.746
That is not exactly
the truth.

38:58.815 --> 39:00.783
I guarantee you
he will call out the troops.

39:00.850 --> 39:03.045
And I assure you that any slight
embellishment of the truth

39:03.119 --> 39:04.313
will be quite forgiven.

39:06.623 --> 39:07.988
I guess you're right.

39:08.057 --> 39:09.524
We'd better go.
Thomas.

39:09.993 --> 39:12.689
I just want to say
one little thing.

39:12.762 --> 39:16.562
I'm really sorry for all the
trouble that I've caused.

39:16.633 --> 39:19.124
And I'm sorry I didn't show
you the photographs earlier.

39:19.202 --> 39:21.534
It's just that I was just so...
You do have a gun.

39:22.272 --> 39:24.638
I was so self-obsessed with
the photographs, you know,

39:24.707 --> 39:26.868
thinking that they wanted them
because they were so good.

39:26.943 --> 39:29.309
And in reality,
they're just a bunch of road signs

39:29.379 --> 39:31.847
that couldn't even cause a ripple
in the photographic art circle.

39:31.915 --> 39:33.280
I was being egotistical,
immature...

39:33.349 --> 39:35.010
Shelly? Shelly!

39:36.953 --> 39:40.480
Could we save this meaningful
revelation until after we rescue Agatha?

39:40.757 --> 39:41.781
Sure.

39:41.858 --> 39:43.985
15:28.
- Exactly.

39:44.060 --> 39:45.049
Right!

39:45.595 --> 39:48.063
Right! Not to worry!

39:49.999 --> 39:50.988
Right.

40:01.444 --> 40:02.934
Why do I have to
wear the wig?

40:03.012 --> 40:04.502
Rick, it's only
for five minutes.

40:04.581 --> 40:06.105
If they don't think
Shelly came along,

40:06.182 --> 40:07.706
they're not gonna
hand over Agatha.

40:07.784 --> 40:09.615
Yeah, but I got...
It's for the good of the operation.

40:09.686 --> 40:11.950
Ready, men?
Yes, I'm ready.

40:12.355 --> 40:13.652
Right on schedule.

40:49.993 --> 40:51.984
That's far enough!

40:55.531 --> 40:56.725
Where's the girl?

40:57.133 --> 40:58.361
She's in the van.

41:02.438 --> 41:04.030
Put the bag down.

41:07.944 --> 41:09.172
Where's David Kirk?

41:09.512 --> 41:11.036
Back up 10 feet.

41:22.458 --> 41:23.447
Go T.C.

41:23.993 --> 41:25.984
T.C.: Roger! Here I come!

41:47.450 --> 41:49.042
Don't even think about it.

41:50.086 --> 41:51.348
Way to go, Thomas!

41:51.454 --> 41:52.580
Where's your wig?

42:03.099 --> 42:06.262
Exactly as we planned,
and no need for the FBl.

42:12.976 --> 42:14.307
Looks like we've found
David Kirk.

42:15.945 --> 42:17.879
Your boss
doesn't like any witnesses.

42:18.114 --> 42:19.604
Cover me.

43:05.361 --> 43:07.420
Hey!
What are you doing?

43:13.736 --> 43:14.964
Where's the FBl?

43:15.838 --> 43:18.363
I couldn't lie to the FBl,
they'd put me in jail.

43:18.975 --> 43:20.567
Put down your gun
or I'll kill her

43:43.332 --> 43:45.857
T.C.: Move it on!
Real easy! Come on!

43:56.679 --> 43:57.668
Well,

43:59.115 --> 44:01.140
I guess we did that,
didn't we, partner?

44:01.784 --> 44:04.446
Oh, no, where are my glasses?
Oh, no!

44:04.921 --> 44:05.910
Thomas...

44:10.026 --> 44:11.357
Are you all right?

44:12.061 --> 44:13.221
Of course.

44:13.529 --> 44:14.518
Agatha?

44:25.241 --> 44:27.368
Are you quite certain
you won't stay for the replay

44:27.443 --> 44:29.843
of the final moments of
the snooker championship?

44:30.246 --> 44:32.771
Oh, no, thank you.
I've had enough excitement for one week.

44:32.849 --> 44:35.545
I just wanted to make sure that
Miss Chumley was all right.

44:35.618 --> 44:37.984
I'm in fine spirits,
thank you.

44:38.321 --> 44:40.414
And I guess thanks
to all of you.

44:40.490 --> 44:42.617
You know, somehow I found
this whole experience

44:42.692 --> 44:45.092
to help me realize that
I'm the only one

44:45.161 --> 44:46.958
comparing myself
to my father.

44:47.263 --> 44:49.697
And that the world is
perfectly willing to accept

44:49.765 --> 44:51.528
Shelly Faraday
all on her own,

44:51.601 --> 44:54.092
with my good points
as well as my faults

44:54.170 --> 44:56.502
and that this experience has been so...
Miss Faraday. Miss Faraday.

44:56.572 --> 45:00.406
I've waited 72 hours to see the
last frame of this tournament.

45:00.476 --> 45:02.637
I wonder if... Oh.
I'm... Of course.

45:02.712 --> 45:04.873
I'm gone.
I'll walk you to the car.

45:04.947 --> 45:07.677
I didn't bring my car.
I'm gonna take the bus.

45:08.084 --> 45:10.678
I'm doing an in-depth study
on bus advertisements.

45:10.753 --> 45:12.118
I think there's
a book in it.

45:12.188 --> 45:13.177
Oh!

45:13.956 --> 45:16.049
Well, I think
that's just great.

45:16.125 --> 45:17.888
I'll walk you to
the bus stop instead.

45:17.960 --> 45:18.949
You'll like this, Agatha.

45:19.028 --> 45:21.861
Caldwell was at the most
delicate and critical moment

45:22.532 --> 45:24.159
And finally,
here in the fortieth frame,

45:24.233 --> 45:30.832
Caldwell lines up into what
could be the winning shot.

45:32.875 --> 45:34.342
Welcome back to Tiger Stadium.

45:34.410 --> 45:35.707
As we continue play here,

45:35.778 --> 45:38.838
in the bottom of the third with the
Tigers leading Toronto two to one,

45:38.915 --> 45:41.213
in front of a excited
opening day crowd.

45:41.284 --> 45:44.082
The Toronto manager's
had his talk with the pitcher

45:44.153 --> 45:47.316
and has returned to the dugout.
And we're ready for action.

45:47.423 --> 45:49.914
Second baseman Lou Whittaker
steps up to the plate.

45:50.026 --> 45:51.926
And it's a base hit.

45:52.662 --> 45:53.651
Baseball?

45:54.230 --> 45:55.424
Sure is.

45:56.265 --> 46:00.031
How? What? Why?

46:02.371 --> 46:05.534
You! You did it!

46:05.875 --> 46:08.275
No, you did.
You put the tape in.

46:08.344 --> 46:11.780
You probably bumped the channel
selector to another satellite station.

46:14.083 --> 46:17.450
Jonathan, that isn't Caldwell.

46:18.254 --> 46:19.812
Whittaker slides.

46:20.489 --> 46:22.423
That's Lou Whittaker, Agatha.

46:24.527 --> 46:26.461
Boy, is he exciting!

46:30.466 --> 46:31.455
Caviar?

46:31.534 --> 46:32.523
Oh, thanks.

46:33.436 --> 46:34.562
Do you have any ketchup?
