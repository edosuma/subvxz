01:23.667 --> 01:25.533
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

01:25.877 --> 01:27.209
Come on, Ben!

01:27.546 --> 01:28.546
Vincent!

01:28.797 --> 01:29.797
Hurry up!

01:35.762 --> 01:37.503
Vincent, what are you doing?

01:42.603 --> 01:43.603
Vincent!

01:46.440 --> 01:47.440
Okay, Ben.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.649
You won!

01:52.446 --> 01:53.527
Vincent?

01:59.828 --> 02:02.411
Admit it.
You're looking forward to this.

02:02.748 --> 02:06.833
I got the weekend crowd.
They're not even going to notice.

02:10.881 --> 02:11.962
Give me a break, Ben.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.086
You're the one that wants to go.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.636
Vincent!

02:31.860 --> 02:32.860
Vincent!

02:36.907 --> 02:38.239
Ben! You little jerk!

02:38.575 --> 02:40.612
Did you get in
and the lid shut on you?

02:42.204 --> 02:44.742
- We go now?
- Yeah, right. We go now.

02:46.625 --> 02:50.335
You'll probably play pool with Joey
after you close the restaurant.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.288
If you're dumb enough to take three
kids to your class reunion...

02:53.590 --> 02:55.206
I'm smart enough
to have a good time.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.758
- Hey, party!
- Party hearty!

03:01.640 --> 03:02.640
Ben!

03:02.724 --> 03:04.716
- I'm underwater!
- That's great news.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.228
Where's your brother?

03:07.437 --> 03:08.437
I don't know.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.388
Will you go find Vincent, please?

03:13.110 --> 03:14.601
Did you remember the sandwiches?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.402
Of course not.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.071
Bethie, if your head wasn't
screwed on...

03:19.408 --> 03:21.650
You'd find it sitting by the microwave.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.825
Then I'd have to call you in Chicago.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.495
Who needs a head
at a high-school reunion?

03:26.832 --> 03:29.074
I want to stay with Dad
and go to the restaurant.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.575
I'm not going to Chicago!

03:30.919 --> 03:32.080
You're going!

03:35.424 --> 03:37.586
I hate Ben, I hate Kerry...

03:37.926 --> 03:39.007
and I hate...

03:39.720 --> 03:41.382
Let me finish out the roll.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.680
Pat, now?

03:42.764 --> 03:43.764
Just two shots!

03:43.932 --> 03:46.720
By the lilacs.
It'll take just a second.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.183
All right, look at Daddy.

03:51.523 --> 03:55.107
I know, the photographer hates
having her picture taken.

03:55.444 --> 03:56.855
Everybody say...

03:57.320 --> 03:58.320
meatball!

04:27.017 --> 04:28.017
Benbo...

04:28.101 --> 04:29.101
bologna is for eating...

04:29.436 --> 04:30.768
not washing windows.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.304
Your seat belt's loose.

04:33.982 --> 04:34.982
Mom, sing me...

04:35.233 --> 04:37.020
that bunny song.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.898
I wish I was still home with Dad.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.860
Sing me,
If a bunny catch a bunny

04:43.200 --> 04:45.362
If a bunny catch a bunny

04:46.620 --> 04:49.237
- Coming through the rye
- I hate this song!

04:49.581 --> 04:50.581
If a bunny...

04:50.791 --> 04:52.032
kiss a bunny

04:52.751 --> 04:54.287
And made a bunny cry

05:18.109 --> 05:19.316
You're here.

05:19.736 --> 05:20.897
I'm here!

05:24.157 --> 05:25.437
Just a second, let me get Kerry.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.907
No, no. Let me get her.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.073
Look at her!

05:31.081 --> 05:32.572
Watch your head, Benbo.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.783
I'm your godmama, Kerry.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.208
Remember me?

05:37.546 --> 05:40.084
God love her! Look at her.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.423
My God!

05:41.591 --> 05:42.707
Is that Ben?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.171
Ben! You're a grown-up.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.048
Vincent, can you swim?

05:47.389 --> 05:48.709
Martha's inside, waiting for you.

05:49.641 --> 05:50.641
Come on, sweetie.

05:50.934 --> 05:51.934
I have a surprise!

05:52.227 --> 05:53.227
Where's your tooth?

05:53.395 --> 05:54.761
I lost it.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.105
Speak of the devil!

05:57.107 --> 05:59.975
Beth, you remember Martha,
the babysitter from God.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.809
Great! Can you help with Kerry?

06:02.153 --> 06:03.439
Sure thing, Mrs. Cappadora.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.780
Mrs. Cappadora.

06:04.906 --> 06:05.987
Good Christ!

06:11.997 --> 06:14.284
Is there some kind of
registration table?

06:14.624 --> 06:16.581
You're set.
I stuck it on my card.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.534
Ellen, you can't do that!

06:18.879 --> 06:20.791
It's 70 bucks. Who cares?

06:21.131 --> 06:22.713
Donna Trump, I care.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.169
Besides, I can write it off.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.463
I've got a fashion shoot on Sunday.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.799
Boutique on Oak Street.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.132
You'll have to go up in
that mess and rearrange it, then.

06:35.687 --> 06:36.687
Oh, Jesus!

06:36.897 --> 06:38.980
Is that Michelle Pulliam?

06:39.316 --> 06:40.648
Did she ever marry that guy?

06:40.984 --> 06:42.544
They broke up.
Then she went out with...

06:42.819 --> 06:45.732
- Elizabeth Kerry and her merry band!
- Jimmy!

06:47.198 --> 06:48.689
How're my big guys?

06:49.034 --> 06:50.034
Wow! Vincent!

06:50.285 --> 06:52.197
You have gotten so huge!

06:53.163 --> 06:55.746
They'd hug any man with a badge,
and so would I.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.581
What would you do if you
found out I made detective?

06:59.586 --> 07:01.122
Congratulations!

07:01.796 --> 07:03.037
Guess who I just saw?

07:03.757 --> 07:04.757
Cecil Lockhart.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.673
You mean Cecilia Lockhart?

07:07.010 --> 07:10.549
Star of stage, screen
and mouthwash commercials.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.172
My God! There she is.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.633
Remember when she first got laid?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.764
When she was 15, and she told us:

07:19.022 --> 07:21.765
"I can't imagine
going a month without it".

07:23.526 --> 07:25.518
She was talking about pizza, guys.

07:25.862 --> 07:26.862
Hey, Beth!

07:27.113 --> 07:29.025
My God! How are you?

07:29.366 --> 07:32.109
- Look at you! How are you?
- Good, good.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.452
Is this your new one?

07:35.163 --> 07:36.244
Where's little Vincent?

07:36.748 --> 07:37.748
I'm not little.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.282
No, you're not.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.709
- Sandy! Bye...
- Mom, I want to go.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.045
I want pizza!

07:43.338 --> 07:45.375
You stay with your brother.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.458
Martha, would you take care of the car?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.464
- I'll handle it.
- I'll pay the thing.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.480
Vincent?

08:01.898 --> 08:05.016
Listen. I want you to hold
Ben's hand real tight.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.569
And you guys can play
on this really cool cart, okay?

08:10.198 --> 08:11.530
Mom, my neck's hot.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.198
My neck's killing me.

08:13.535 --> 08:14.535
Vincent, listen.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.194
This'll only take a second.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.746
Stay here with Ben while I
pay the lady.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.165
When Martha comes,
she'll take you swimming, okay?

08:40.687 --> 08:41.687
Thanks.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.514
- Sorry it took so long.
- That's okay.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.780
Where's Ben?

08:54.117 --> 08:56.277
He wouldn't let me hold him.
Would you look at my neck?

08:56.494 --> 08:58.486
I've got a heat rash or something.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.414
Hold on, sweetie.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.295
Ben?

09:11.509 --> 09:12.509
Ellen?

09:12.635 --> 09:14.877
Ben took off. Would you...?

09:15.221 --> 09:16.962
I'll find him.
See you later.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.511
You stay here. Don't move.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.353
Ben?

09:38.078 --> 09:39.285
Have you seen a little boy?

09:39.621 --> 09:42.079
He's got a red baseball cap,
3 years old.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.415
No, sorry.

09:43.917 --> 09:44.998
Thanks.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.374
Ben?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.685
Excuse me.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.234
Vincent...

10:10.360 --> 10:11.441
think hard.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.314
Which way did Ben go?

10:13.655 --> 10:14.987
I don't know.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.323
Didn't you watch?

10:17.450 --> 10:18.566
I couldn't see him.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.155
He wasn't over there.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.657
We should get the manager.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.158
I don't know.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.206
Maybe if we just wait...

10:41.891 --> 10:42.891
Stop!

10:43.017 --> 10:45.509
Everybody please just
listen up for a second.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.895
We need to look for
Beth Kerry's little boy.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.598
His name is Ben.

10:50.942 --> 10:53.980
He's 3, he was wearing
a red baseball cap.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.811
He was just here a second ago.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.239
So if you'd look around
where you are.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.575
Wait. Hold on, folks.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.450
We'll find him.
It's going to be fine.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.578
I'm going to divide the room
down the middle.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.657
I want you to stay
in your half and look around you.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.037
If you see Ben...

11:09.377 --> 11:11.960
pick him up and call out
to me, all right?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.103
Pat will be here soon, right?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.056
I didn't call him.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.776
I thought we'd find Ben right away.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.068
Let's make that call now, right?

11:50.251 --> 11:51.458
Here you go.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.499
Go ahead, Beth.

11:57.342 --> 11:58.378
- Hello?
- Patty!

12:12.774 --> 12:14.185
Magill, talk to the female.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.232
Coleman, come with me.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.280
Mrs. Cappadora?

12:20.448 --> 12:21.689
I'm Officer Magill.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.449
You brought a lot of officers.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.158
We take the disappearance of a
child very seriously.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.657
You're worried, then?

12:32.752 --> 12:33.752
We'll find him.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.119
Lost kids,
we always find them.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.087
And they're okay.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.834
- They're not hurt.
- Good.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.213
If it gets to five hours,
we usually consider it...

12:43.263 --> 12:45.880
Anyway, we'll find him before then.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.433
So your friend Elaine was with you?

12:54.565 --> 12:55.565
Ellen.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.355
She met me out front.
She was waiting for me.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.396
Besides Ellen, who was
the first person you talked to?

13:04.409 --> 13:05.409
The cheerleaders.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.195
Would another family member...

13:08.329 --> 13:10.662
on your side have any reason
to pick up the boy?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.740
My folks are dead.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.329
There's nobody.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.535
Has he ever been fingerprinted?

13:17.255 --> 13:18.255
No.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.132
Yes!

13:20.508 --> 13:23.125
The school district had a program.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.018
It's been four hours.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.267
We've got everybody on it, okay?

13:36.899 --> 13:39.812
This is my boss,
Detective Supervisor Bliss.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.482
- Bliss?
- Candy Bliss.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.939
It sounds like a stripper's name.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.024
The things parents do to kids!

13:48.328 --> 13:50.115
I can't believe I said that.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.913
We'll do everything we can
to find your boy.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.249
Description out?

13:54.292 --> 13:55.658
They're checking the database now.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.085
Great.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.254
First, I want to tell you this is
nobody's fault.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.875
Kids disappear all the time,
and somebody always finds them.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.218
That's right.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.260
We're set up over here.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.397
Where is he?

14:17.607 --> 14:19.644
My son! Where is he?

14:20.068 --> 14:21.275
We haven't found him yet...

14:21.611 --> 14:22.943
Where's Ben?

14:23.279 --> 14:24.279
Where's Bethie?

14:24.530 --> 14:25.530
Bethie?

14:25.948 --> 14:26.948
Pat!

14:33.748 --> 14:35.080
How did this happen?

14:36.626 --> 14:37.867
Okay, all right, okay.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.211
It'll be okay.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.120
Where is it nobody's searched?

14:41.464 --> 14:42.464
The basement?

14:42.715 --> 14:45.378
It's just food storage.
All the doors are kept locked.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.380
But you have freezers, cabinets?

14:48.054 --> 14:50.467
Ben loves hiding places.
Take me down there.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.102
You okay?

14:55.186 --> 14:56.186
You sure?

14:56.562 --> 15:00.021
I'm going downstairs a minute.
You stay here with Mommy, okay?

15:00.900 --> 15:01.900
Let's go.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.419
Mom!

15:20.628 --> 15:21.664
Patty!

15:22.004 --> 15:23.586
Are you all right?

15:27.635 --> 15:30.298
My God in heaven!
How long has he been missing?

15:30.638 --> 15:32.379
About five hours.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.600
They'll remember.
They'll make one more call.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.376
I'll take you to the command center.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.054
Kerry and Vincent will come...

15:40.398 --> 15:41.718
to the house. It's better, right?

15:41.816 --> 15:43.899
- Where's Kerry?
- Upstairs.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.185
You'll come with Grandma, honey.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.028
You go with Grandma, Vincent, okay?

15:59.208 --> 16:02.417
Will you tell me when
Ben gets back, Mom?

16:02.753 --> 16:03.753
She'll tell us.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.454
Sit down, sweetheart.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.378
I'm sorry.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.756
Do you have any other pictures of Ben?

16:12.972 --> 16:13.972
I lost my purse.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.219
No, no, no.
I have it, honey.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.445
Ben!

16:35.620 --> 16:37.577
Bethie, honey, it's okay.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.574
Set her down!

16:42.084 --> 16:43.916
I want Ben!

16:44.253 --> 16:46.666
Grab her wrist and hold her down.
Medic!

16:47.006 --> 16:48.292
It's okay. It's all right.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.468
Give her something!

16:51.802 --> 16:52.802
Quick!

16:54.555 --> 16:56.387
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's all right.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.554
I know, Bethie. I know.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.307
You don't know.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.310
I don't even know.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.366
How long are you
staying with your parents?

17:20.705 --> 17:22.196
Do the police have leads?

17:22.541 --> 17:24.625
Have the kidnappers
tried to contact you?

17:25.211 --> 17:27.749
How long were you gone before you
noticed your son was missing?

17:28.089 --> 17:31.628
- Who'd want to do this?
- How long will you be in Chicago?

17:32.969 --> 17:34.631
He's 3 years old...

17:35.012 --> 17:36.253
but he's big for his age.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.759
And people always think he's older.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.433
He's very verbal.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.136
He babbles to himself.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.764
Sometimes you can barely hear him...

17:47.108 --> 17:50.067
but he says his words very clearly.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.149
He has blond hair and blue eyes.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.489
And he was wearing...

17:54.740 --> 17:56.151
a red baseball cap.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.859
And he loves pizza.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.156
He's very afraid of the water.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.252
He loves...

18:08.129 --> 18:09.129
to sing songs.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.498
Sometimes he'll sing the same song
over and over again.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.004
He was wearing...

18:19.098 --> 18:20.680
red shoes.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.184
High-top sneakers with
green parrots on the side.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.728
And white socks.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.062
And a red T-shirt...

18:31.402 --> 18:33.234
with yellow sleeves...

18:34.780 --> 18:37.443
and little blue shorts.
Blue plaid shorts.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.735
Call you when we get home.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.610
Unbelievable, right?

19:16.697 --> 19:18.097
Diane Lundgren's on her way over...

19:18.407 --> 19:20.239
and Cecil Lockhart signed up.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.443
But her mother got sick.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.571
You know who else called?

19:25.915 --> 19:27.406
Lizzy De Nunzio.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.538
- Where is she now, Switzerland?
- I think she moved there.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.245
- How'd she even find out about it?
- Who knows?

19:33.589 --> 19:35.797
But she just sounds sick about it.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.462
- Everyone is, Bethie.
- I know.

19:38.803 --> 19:39.839
I know.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.420
Laurie!

19:42.473 --> 19:43.593
I can't believe you're here.

19:43.724 --> 19:47.013
What was I supposed to do?
Stay in Madison? Watch CNN?

20:42.783 --> 20:43.990
Hey, Tommy.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.280
Have you seen Candy?

20:46.620 --> 20:48.987
- She's with McGuire.
- Thanks, Ricky.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.666
Then go to Minneapolis.
How far can it be?

20:53.002 --> 20:54.743
We've been getting
bogus leads...

20:55.087 --> 20:58.296
every day for six weeks now.
This kid is dead and you know it.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.999
Don't tell me I know it!
I don't know it.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.460
This is interstate.
I have to call the FBI.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.796
Come on, Candy, the FBI?

21:06.140 --> 21:07.631
Give me a break.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.263
Hey, Bethie.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.137
So you heard that?

21:13.481 --> 21:16.019
I heard something about the FBI.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.894
Come into my office.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.398
Have a seat.

21:26.577 --> 21:27.658
Listen, Beth.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.032
Just because volunteers
are going home...

21:30.372 --> 21:31.954
doesn't mean the case is closed.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.827
Some of them got lives.

21:34.168 --> 21:35.168
I don't.

21:35.503 --> 21:36.664
So I'm here.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.666
And I'm not giving up.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.219
I'm sorry, I didn't...

21:49.391 --> 21:50.391
I'm a jerk.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.511
There's nothing wrong
with what you just did.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.436
I'm just an oversensitive jerk.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.135
You're too involved. You can't...

21:57.942 --> 21:58.942
I'm black.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.609
I'm a woman.
I'm a detective supervisor.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.445
And I'm gay.
Did you know that?

22:04.824 --> 22:07.817
I always feel like the eyes
of Texas are on me.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.777
Every time I hug Katie
from Crime Stoppers...

22:11.121 --> 22:12.908
I think she thinks
I'm coming on to her.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.249
I wasn't...

22:14.291 --> 22:15.623
No, I know that.

22:15.960 --> 22:19.795
I just wanted you to know
I'm a little jerkish today.

22:20.714 --> 22:23.172
So that calls for a Gummi Bear.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.293
Tough guys chew Gummi Bears.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.551
Beth, you laughed.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.008
You only laughed.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.638
It doesn't mean our side loses points.

22:38.983 --> 22:42.397
It doesn't mean you'll
kill your son because you laughed.

22:42.736 --> 22:45.353
You have got to survive.

22:47.616 --> 22:48.902
That's just it.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.527
I don't want to survive Ben.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.164
I don't want to face it.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.909
Then I guess you can just...

22:59.253 --> 23:02.963
move into a corner in my office,
and I'll use you as a coat rack.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.544
You got to do whatever you got to do.

23:05.885 --> 23:10.004
But you got two great kids, which I
would give my right arm for.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.590
Though you think
you're a terrible mother...

23:12.933 --> 23:15.175
you're the only mother they have.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.311
I should go home.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.357
Jill's been great with Kerry.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.693
Really great.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.439
But I think Vincent's
going to need a little time.

24:11.116 --> 24:14.109
He'll be fine.
He's been back, what, six weeks?

24:15.621 --> 24:17.863
I'm sure he'll be fine.

24:46.819 --> 24:47.819
Coming?

25:00.249 --> 25:01.581
Jill, we're back!

25:10.884 --> 25:12.295
Baby, you scared me.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.502
How's my big guy?

25:14.847 --> 25:16.133
Are you good?

25:16.473 --> 25:17.473
Mom, guess what?

25:17.599 --> 25:21.309
On Thursday, I made
six baskets in a row!

25:22.021 --> 25:24.229
Look how long your legs are.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.400
How is she?
Has she been in bed all day?

27:00.744 --> 27:01.744
Pretty much.

27:01.829 --> 27:04.037
How'd Vincent get home?
Did you pick him up?

27:04.373 --> 27:06.239
Yeah, I didn't have class today.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.583
Okay, thanks.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.667
Did she say
she was coming down?

27:10.003 --> 27:11.003
No, she didn't.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.834
So some girl walks in, chewing gum...

27:14.174 --> 27:15.585
and talking through her nose...

27:15.926 --> 27:17.713
has legs up to her neck.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.212
Paolo just says,
"Great, you're hired!"

27:20.639 --> 27:21.639
The new kids we got...

27:22.516 --> 27:24.678
don't know spaghetti from scampi.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.891
They think the cash register
is their personal savings account.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.731
I'll tell you what...

27:32.359 --> 27:34.191
when I open my own place...

27:34.528 --> 27:36.815
this is exactly what you won't see.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.264
Guess what happened.

28:03.557 --> 28:05.423
I thought today was Sunday.

28:06.476 --> 28:07.717
Isn't that funny?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.595
Can we just please go?

30:01.633 --> 30:03.249
I'm going to work, honey.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.171
Beth, you downstairs?

30:17.691 --> 30:19.307
Honey, what are you doing?

30:27.075 --> 30:30.068
Ever been in a doctor's office
without a People magazine?

30:30.412 --> 30:33.701
One day, Ben will go to a doctor's
office with whoever took him.

30:34.041 --> 30:37.284
- And some other patient...
- Laurie, stop! Okay?

30:37.919 --> 30:40.332
I know you mean well, but just...

30:40.672 --> 30:41.753
stop.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.483
- That's real leather?
- You bet!

31:02.819 --> 31:04.731
- Thanks, Uncle Joey.
- You're welcome.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.608
Check this out, buddy.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.535
Could be more presents.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.038
Merry Christmas!

31:16.625 --> 31:18.912
Joey, it's cold.
Shut the door.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.128
- Where's the tree?
- Pat went to get it.

31:23.465 --> 31:24.876
Where's my presents?

31:27.219 --> 31:28.676
Merry Christmas, Beth!

31:29.930 --> 31:33.799
Mom, look, Uncle Joey gave me
my stocking present early...

31:34.142 --> 31:35.929
because it's too big
to fit in the stocking.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.386
- See?
- Yeah, that's great!

31:41.233 --> 31:42.233
Merry Christmas, Beth.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.518
- Merry Christmas, Theresa.
- How you feeling, honey?

31:44.861 --> 31:47.729
I almost didn't make it.
I started having Braxton-Hicks.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.939
- You should breathe in a bag.
- I'll try that.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.070
- May be a Christmas baby.
- I hope not.

31:52.411 --> 31:55.779
She's carrying like it's a boy.
That's what everybody says.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.246
The gang's all here!

31:58.583 --> 32:01.496
- My God, sis, look how big you are!
- Don't rub it in.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.044
Patty, it's beautiful!

32:04.339 --> 32:06.581
- Who do you think these are for?
- Me?

32:08.343 --> 32:10.801
One is from me,
and one's from Grandpa Angelo.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.346
- Help me wrap.
- Look at the cards.

32:13.682 --> 32:15.139
Did you buy out
the whole store?

32:15.475 --> 32:16.807
Who's counting?
It's Christmas.

32:17.185 --> 32:19.518
Now, these are very special.

32:23.275 --> 32:26.484
Look, Mom, they're for Ben
from Grandma and Grandpa.

32:31.158 --> 32:32.899
Rosie, what are these?

32:33.660 --> 32:35.117
Presents for Ben.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.441
Why did you bring presents for Ben?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.910
I believe that Ben will be found.

32:44.296 --> 32:48.006
When he is found, I want him to
know his family didn't forget him.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.258
Do you have the impression
we've forgotten Ben?

32:51.678 --> 32:53.044
Of course not.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.471
- We didn't get Ben any gifts.
- I understand that.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.924
I didn't even want to go through...

32:58.268 --> 33:00.476
this whole, big holiday act.

33:00.812 --> 33:04.226
You know what I wanted to do?
I wanted to sleep through it.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.398
When you do this, like he's just...

33:06.735 --> 33:10.354
out of town on some business trip
and he'll be back anytime...

33:10.697 --> 33:12.404
- Beth, take it easy.
- Take it easy!

33:12.741 --> 33:14.903
How can I take it easy
when nobody except me...

33:15.243 --> 33:18.156
seems to want to accept
the fact that it's over?

33:18.705 --> 33:19.705
It's over!

33:19.873 --> 33:22.490
We're all going to go on
eating and sleeping...

33:22.834 --> 33:25.542
You have to snap out of this.
No one can talk to you.

33:25.879 --> 33:26.879
I can't.

33:26.963 --> 33:27.963
- Pat can't.
- Butt out!

33:28.215 --> 33:30.832
If you don't have hope
Ben will come back...

33:31.176 --> 33:33.418
Come back?
He's not even 4 yet.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.300
What's he going to do?
Get an Amtrak schedule?

33:36.848 --> 33:38.430
We didn't mean anything by it.

33:40.101 --> 33:42.559
- Don't you think we're all grieving?
- I mean it!

33:42.896 --> 33:43.896
- Shut up!
- No, Pat!

33:44.314 --> 33:46.397
You're all scared to say this,
but I'm not.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.149
We try and call.
She doesn't want to talk.

33:49.486 --> 33:50.647
We write. She doesn't answer.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.861
Mom, Ben will be back tomorrow.

33:54.449 --> 33:55.449
What?

33:55.575 --> 33:57.783
Because it's Christmas.
For my present...

33:58.119 --> 33:59.610
I asked Santa to bring Ben home.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.988
I think he'll do it.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.958
- Where is she?
- She's upstairs.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.956
She still won't speak to me, will she?

34:09.297 --> 34:10.708
I think she will.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.630
Everybody's been calling.

34:12.967 --> 34:16.005
After your talk with People,
we reprinted the poster five times.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.797
I think she hates my guts.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.402
What are you doing?

34:34.739 --> 34:35.980
Ending world hunger.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.190
I just got off the phone with the U. N.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.614
That's good.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.123
Look, will you just forgive me...

34:46.458 --> 34:47.949
and get this over with?

34:48.295 --> 34:51.914
I'd never give them anything unless
it was the right thing to do.

34:52.257 --> 34:55.341
I would never do a thing to hurt you.

34:56.386 --> 34:57.752
How long have we been friends?

34:58.638 --> 35:00.721
One thousand years.

35:01.308 --> 35:03.891
- I know.
- Then good, okay?

35:05.020 --> 35:06.602
I have something I want you to do.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.430
I don't believe you.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.814
- I want you to take a picture.
- I don't do that anymore.

35:14.154 --> 35:16.111
I took early retirement.

35:16.448 --> 35:17.780
You could use the money.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.698
This is good money.

35:20.327 --> 35:21.327
Good for what?

35:21.494 --> 35:23.611
I want her to take a portrait
of a Chinese family.

35:24.331 --> 35:27.665
We are kind of tapped out,
just keeping Vincent in sneakers.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.659
You could do this.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.365
You wouldn't even have to go out.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.917
I threw away all my paper and stuff.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.636
I'll go get you more paper and stuff.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.264
Please.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.428
Please, just this once.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.014
Let me get rid of my guilt
by doing you this one good turn.

35:48.355 --> 35:51.519
This is not a good turn.
This is a setup.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.793
These are really beautiful.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.261
I have to print.
I have four phone calls to make.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.059
I have to get Vincent
ready for Little League.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.395
Thought any more about Chicago?

37:13.773 --> 37:14.854
What about it?

37:16.067 --> 37:17.228
Could be great.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.026
Kids'll love it there.

37:19.362 --> 37:22.025
- I'll have my own restaurant.
- I have to get Kerry up.

37:22.365 --> 37:25.028
- There's plenty of time for that.
- Okay, fine.

37:25.368 --> 37:29.487
You go upstairs, get my diaphragm,
fill it up with gunk and...

37:29.831 --> 37:32.824
we'll have eight minutes
before I have to feed Vincent.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.285
We can have a lot
of fun in eight minutes.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.404
Fine. You want to do it right here?

37:37.630 --> 37:39.292
I can make toast at the same time.

37:39.674 --> 37:42.212
It's not like I'm on top of you
all the time.

37:42.552 --> 37:44.919
We make love as often
as we pay the water bill.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.922
I don't see why you need
a diaphragm every time.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.508
I don't want to
get pregnant every time.

37:51.019 --> 37:54.512
We had three kids and we always
wanted more. I miss that.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.392
I miss this house being full of noise.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.850
I used to want to
run up the walk to lunch.

37:59.861 --> 38:02.274
It's not going to change anything.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.189
Another kid.
It'd be like a replacement part.

38:05.575 --> 38:08.568
Like you get a new gravy boat
so you don't spoil the set.

38:09.370 --> 38:10.861
That's a lousy fucking thing to say.

38:11.206 --> 38:14.790
I agree. So I'll stop saying
fucking lousy things.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.960
I'm not having a baby,
and I'm not moving to Chicago...

38:18.296 --> 38:20.834
so you can start
a restaurant with your dad.

38:22.258 --> 38:25.092
You want a new baby and restaurant?
You need a new wife.

38:27.597 --> 38:30.681
All I want is for us
to be a family again.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.633
Nothing's wrong with that.

38:32.977 --> 38:33.977
That's healthy!

38:34.062 --> 38:35.894
You want to know what it's like?

38:36.231 --> 38:39.395
It's like I'm standing
under this giant...

38:39.734 --> 38:40.734
snowbank.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.981
If I move one inch
in any direction...

38:44.155 --> 38:46.112
it's going to come crashing down...

38:46.658 --> 38:47.990
and bury me.

38:48.409 --> 38:49.409
Do you know...

38:49.494 --> 38:52.077
I don't dare think of him
for a full minute?

38:52.914 --> 38:53.914
One inch...

38:54.499 --> 38:56.365
and the whole thing's
going to come down.

38:56.709 --> 38:59.577
You will have to raise
these kids by yourself.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.004
I'm doing that now.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.252
That's right.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.254
Pat's always been the rock.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.381
Isn't that what it said
in People?

39:08.721 --> 39:11.429
There was Pat holding together
that poor, crazy woman...

39:11.766 --> 39:14.304
and those sweet little kids.
You're such a hero.

39:14.686 --> 39:15.722
All right, stop this.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.224
You would never have let
Ben get lost.

39:18.565 --> 39:19.565
I mean it. Stop it.

39:19.649 --> 39:22.107
You wouldn't have been such a
shitty parent...

39:22.443 --> 39:23.934
who can't remember the sandwiches...

39:24.279 --> 39:25.861
who can't get
Kerry's bottle together!

39:26.197 --> 39:27.483
That's right, I wouldn't!

39:28.074 --> 39:31.363
If you'd just pay attention
to somebody besides yourself!

39:31.703 --> 39:33.820
None of this would have
happened, right?

39:36.666 --> 39:37.747
Scream!

39:38.126 --> 39:40.243
Come on, Kerry.
Scream!

39:40.587 --> 39:41.919
I was there to pick up after you!

39:42.255 --> 39:44.121
You self-righteous son of a bitch!

39:44.465 --> 39:46.377
I'm not self-righteous! I'm right!

39:46.718 --> 39:49.005
Kids don't just vanish up in smoke.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.052
Kids don't just get lost.

39:51.472 --> 39:52.633
People lose them!

40:01.190 --> 40:02.806
Vincent, what happened?

40:03.234 --> 40:04.645
What happened, honey?

40:05.194 --> 40:06.651
Why was she screaming?

40:08.448 --> 40:09.448
Is she all right?

40:09.782 --> 40:10.989
Yeah, she's fine.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.184
Where are we going?

41:21.229 --> 41:23.095
Just thought I'd take a drive.

41:34.409 --> 41:36.571
She just misses him, Daddy.

41:40.456 --> 41:41.947
That's right, Vincent.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.210
That's right.

42:17.785 --> 42:19.742
This is the bar and the waiting area.

42:20.079 --> 42:22.787
That's the wine rack.
Dad's personal design.

42:23.124 --> 42:25.457
People sit here while they
wait for tables.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.748
That's the kitchen back there...

42:29.088 --> 42:30.169
and this is it.

42:31.257 --> 42:32.873
The murals are done.

42:33.217 --> 42:34.674
Tables will be through here...

42:35.011 --> 42:37.128
and they'll carry back
over to there.

42:37.722 --> 42:39.258
This is the dance floor.

42:39.599 --> 42:41.431
There'll be a live band over here...

42:41.809 --> 42:43.016
Thursday through Sunday.

42:44.062 --> 42:46.054
Theresa, is that a town in Italy?

42:46.397 --> 42:48.013
You like it, honey?

42:48.399 --> 42:49.399
It's La Boheme.

42:50.443 --> 42:51.900
You're Mimi and I'm Rodolfo.

42:52.236 --> 42:55.104
- Except she lives in the end.
- Well, good.

42:55.782 --> 42:59.196
- It's gorgeous. It really is.
- Can you believe this place?

42:59.535 --> 43:00.946
I don't.

43:01.287 --> 43:02.448
I can't wait.

43:02.789 --> 43:05.748
That's a good one.
We got to get in that.

43:08.586 --> 43:09.918
Alex, come on, listen.

43:13.508 --> 43:15.875
So what's Mr. Tough Guy up to?

43:16.260 --> 43:17.796
Apart from needing a haircut.

43:18.137 --> 43:19.173
I don't know.

43:19.514 --> 43:20.925
He's making friends, I guess.

43:22.058 --> 43:24.175
He's been on the phone a lot lately.

43:25.144 --> 43:27.852
If you're using that phone
for your bookie operation...

43:28.189 --> 43:31.728
it'll be a part of your anatomy.
- I'm not, Dad. Jesus!

43:32.068 --> 43:33.068
I got to go.

43:37.365 --> 43:39.527
Well, this is really nice.

43:39.867 --> 43:41.108
It is, isn't it?

43:42.036 --> 43:43.777
New house, new restaurant.

43:44.122 --> 43:48.162
You're doing a really good
imitation of having a life.

43:59.095 --> 44:01.178
You have the biggest snarl right here.

44:01.514 --> 44:03.756
No, wait, Kerry. Just one more.

44:14.610 --> 44:15.610
Are you in sixth?

44:15.778 --> 44:17.644
Yeah. You're in third.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.355
You were the soybean, right?

44:19.699 --> 44:21.531
Actually, I was the feed corn.

44:21.868 --> 44:22.868
Who do you have?

44:23.035 --> 44:24.776
- Cook.
- Yeah, I had Cook.

44:25.121 --> 44:26.578
She's pretty decent.

44:30.835 --> 44:31.835
Mommy?

44:35.673 --> 44:36.673
Are you okay?

44:38.176 --> 44:39.508
Yeah, I'm fine.

44:40.553 --> 44:44.467
I was leaving my number in case
you needed your lawn mowed.

44:44.807 --> 44:45.843
But I'll come back later.

44:48.728 --> 44:50.811
I really do need my lawn mowed.

44:52.023 --> 44:53.434
Could you do it today?

44:53.774 --> 44:55.436
Yeah. Sure.

44:55.776 --> 44:58.268
I'll get my stuff.
I live two blocks down there.

44:58.863 --> 45:01.230
You don't need a mower!
We have a mower.

45:01.574 --> 45:03.110
My brother's supposed to do it.

45:03.451 --> 45:04.691
He's in high school. He's lazy!

45:04.911 --> 45:06.322
Do you know that boy?

45:06.662 --> 45:09.325
It's not talking to strangers
if you're in your own house.

45:09.916 --> 45:10.916
I know.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.208
That's true.
Do you know his name?

45:14.879 --> 45:17.246
It's Jason. He's on patrol.

45:17.590 --> 45:19.047
No, wait, I'm wrong.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.875
Jason wears the beanie hat.
He got reported.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.927
You don't know his name?

45:24.513 --> 45:25.513
It's Sam Kero.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.214
Kero something.

45:31.896 --> 45:33.728
Mom, where are you going?

45:44.784 --> 45:46.275
Are you going to work?

45:47.703 --> 45:48.739
You know what?

45:49.497 --> 45:51.989
I have to take some leaf pictures.

45:52.333 --> 45:55.872
It's okay if you go across
the street and play with Blythe.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.803
I'm taking pictures of leaves.

46:56.147 --> 46:58.264
That's my job. I take pictures.

47:19.462 --> 47:20.462
Shit!

47:45.738 --> 47:48.902
Lord God, Lamb of God,
Son of the Father who takes away sin.

47:49.241 --> 47:51.483
Have mercy on us.
Have mercy on us.

48:43.045 --> 48:46.209
I want you to go downstairs
and order a pizza.

48:46.549 --> 48:47.915
Do that, then go to Blythe's...

48:48.259 --> 48:50.125
get Kerry and put on
a video for her.

48:50.469 --> 48:51.630
Get the money from my purse.

48:51.971 --> 48:53.633
I have to work in the darkroom.

48:53.973 --> 48:56.886
It's very important and it can't wait.

48:57.226 --> 48:59.843
I want you to give Kerry pizza.
Will you do that?

49:00.187 --> 49:02.429
Don't I always? Jesus!

50:07.171 --> 50:08.628
It is, isn't it?

50:09.715 --> 50:10.715
Is this possible?

50:10.966 --> 50:15.381
Here's the aging projection they did
around the time he was 8.

50:17.890 --> 50:18.890
Who is he?

50:19.225 --> 50:21.968
He came to the door to mow lawns.
I let him mow the lawn.

50:22.311 --> 50:24.098
He's coming back tomorrow.
He ran out of gas.

50:24.438 --> 50:25.679
Where does he live?

50:26.440 --> 50:27.440
Two blocks.

50:28.734 --> 50:30.350
Two blocks from here?

50:30.819 --> 50:31.819
Did he just move here?

50:32.071 --> 50:33.653
I don't know how long...

50:33.989 --> 50:36.902
Kerry knows him from school,
and she's been at Sandburg...

50:37.243 --> 50:39.280
for what, two years?
Good Christ!

50:41.622 --> 50:44.706
He's probably just some kid
who looks like Ben.

50:45.042 --> 50:47.455
- His hair is darker.
- No, you're right.

50:49.547 --> 50:52.335
Let's call Candy.
Then we're going to that house.

50:52.675 --> 50:54.917
It's late at night.
He's sleeping.

50:55.261 --> 50:57.674
We don't even know his last name.

50:59.348 --> 51:01.931
Two blocks from here. I mean...

51:02.268 --> 51:03.788
- When he saw you, did he...
- Nothing.

51:03.978 --> 51:08.268
He had no idea. But he was 3,
and he doesn't know this house.

51:14.905 --> 51:15.941
I'm going to call Pop.

51:16.282 --> 51:18.114
Don't tell him.
Not until we know.

51:18.450 --> 51:19.691
No, I just...

51:20.035 --> 51:22.072
I'm not going to work tomorrow.

51:39.763 --> 51:41.755
What were you doing on the porch?

51:42.391 --> 51:43.927
I was watching the sun come up.

51:44.518 --> 51:47.181
- You got a ride?
- Kenny's dad is picking me up.

51:47.688 --> 51:48.688
Finish up.

51:48.897 --> 51:51.389
- I'm riding my bike.
- No, you're not.

51:51.734 --> 51:54.943
I'm 9 now. I'm older than
the other 18 kids in my class.

51:55.279 --> 51:57.521
People who live in walking distance
don't ride bikes.

51:57.865 --> 51:59.527
Besides, you don't have a bike lock.

51:59.867 --> 52:01.483
Could you get me one?

52:01.827 --> 52:04.740
Yes, I'll get you a
bike lock today. I promise.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.787
You can ride your bike
to school tomorrow.

52:07.124 --> 52:08.410
Come on, let's go.

52:17.968 --> 52:18.968
Bye, Mom.

52:19.595 --> 52:20.881
Vincent, wait.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.091
I love you.

52:27.269 --> 52:30.228
- I want you to know I love you.
- Thank you, Mom.

53:06.350 --> 53:08.216
I know it sounds insane.

53:08.686 --> 53:10.427
I don't know if it's him for sure.

53:10.771 --> 53:12.228
I don't know what I know.

53:13.857 --> 53:15.723
It can't be Ben...

53:16.068 --> 53:17.229
but it's Ben.

53:18.487 --> 53:19.487
Isn't it?

53:23.784 --> 53:25.275
I say we go in.

53:25.619 --> 53:27.030
He's in protective custody.

53:27.538 --> 53:30.246
We got an unmarked in front
of the suspect's house.

53:30.582 --> 53:32.164
We snatched the kid from school.

53:32.501 --> 53:34.288
The principal probably
called the father.

53:34.628 --> 53:35.744
What are we waiting for?

53:36.088 --> 53:38.421
There's a process involved here.

53:38.757 --> 53:41.295
It's not like you're
bringing him home today.

53:41.635 --> 53:44.378
He'll have to go to foster care.
He'll need counseling.

53:45.013 --> 53:46.595
There'll be a period of transition.

53:46.932 --> 53:50.175
Anyway, we want to make sure
we L. D. the boy 100%.

53:50.686 --> 53:51.767
Look at the picture!

53:52.396 --> 53:54.388
It's the same kid.
It's Sam Karras!

53:54.732 --> 53:57.145
Don't go off half-cocked on me.
This is a big case.

53:57.443 --> 53:59.810
It wouldn't hurt to get a warrant.

54:01.071 --> 54:02.437
I got the warrant.

54:02.906 --> 54:04.863
I talked to the D. A.

54:05.492 --> 54:06.492
Bliss.

54:09.455 --> 54:10.536
Thank you.

54:12.916 --> 54:14.373
The fingerprints match.

54:20.174 --> 54:21.665
You folks ready for this?

54:23.969 --> 54:26.461
You don't get to be ready for this.

54:37.399 --> 54:39.482
They're busting you for
hot-wiring Jamie's car.

54:39.818 --> 54:43.107
I don't think so.
I'm going to call you later, okay?

54:45.324 --> 54:46.324
Shit!

54:50.662 --> 54:52.244
Come in here, will you please?

54:54.458 --> 54:55.994
This is Chief Bastokovich.

54:56.335 --> 54:58.201
Kerry's got Girl Scouts, right?

54:58.545 --> 54:59.545
I think...

54:59.630 --> 55:01.542
She won't be home till after five?

55:01.882 --> 55:02.882
Right.

55:14.686 --> 55:16.928
You saw that picture this morning.

55:17.523 --> 55:19.515
That's why the police are here.

55:19.817 --> 55:22.230
I thought it was a fire drill.
Can I just go upstairs?

55:23.654 --> 55:24.815
Listen to me.

55:25.531 --> 55:29.024
We think the boy in
that picture is Ben.

55:29.368 --> 55:31.735
The kid in that house on Maple, right?

55:32.287 --> 55:33.403
You saw him?

55:36.667 --> 55:37.828
You saw Ben?

55:38.168 --> 55:40.831
I didn't know it was Ben.
I'd see this kid goofing around.

55:41.171 --> 55:42.457
I mean, he looked..

55:43.006 --> 55:45.464
I never really thought
about it much.

55:46.343 --> 55:47.459
Why didn't you tell me?

55:48.470 --> 55:50.962
Why didn't you tell me
or your father?

55:51.306 --> 55:52.717
Tell you what?

55:53.058 --> 55:55.050
I found my long-lost brother?

55:55.394 --> 55:56.760
Would you have listened to me?

55:57.104 --> 55:58.515
Would you have even heard me?

55:58.856 --> 56:00.142
When did you first see him?

56:00.482 --> 56:02.474
How long have we lived here?

56:07.447 --> 56:09.063
It doesn't matter now.

56:10.284 --> 56:11.775
I'll tell you when...

56:12.619 --> 56:14.485
- I'll tell you.
- Fine. Do that.

56:22.170 --> 56:23.170
Hi, Pop.

56:25.215 --> 56:26.581
They're about to move on him.

56:28.051 --> 56:29.051
Ready.

56:32.514 --> 56:33.514
You stay here.

56:33.807 --> 56:36.015
We'll call you in 15 minutes.

57:27.694 --> 57:28.730
I'm coming in.

57:29.363 --> 57:30.363
I'm coming in.

57:37.287 --> 57:39.870
You don't say anything.
Just listen.

57:53.637 --> 57:55.048
George Karras?

57:56.223 --> 57:58.681
- What's wrong?
- I'm Detective Candy Bliss.

57:59.017 --> 58:02.226
Do you have a 12-year-old boy
named Sam living in this house?

58:02.562 --> 58:03.598
Yes, I do.

58:05.232 --> 58:06.689
My God, my son. Is he hurt?

58:07.025 --> 58:08.141
No, he's fine.

58:08.485 --> 58:10.852
He's in the custody
of Protective Services.

58:11.196 --> 58:12.876
What are you talking about?
He's at school.

58:13.115 --> 58:15.232
You're under arrest for kidnapping...

58:16.284 --> 58:17.684
in connection with the abduction...

58:17.786 --> 58:20.699
June 3rd, 1988, of Benjamin Cappadora.

58:21.039 --> 58:23.452
You have the right to remain silent.

58:23.959 --> 58:26.372
What you say can and will be
used against you...

58:26.712 --> 58:28.203
You've got the wrong house.

58:28.547 --> 58:31.085
The people that lost their boy
live around the corner.

58:31.425 --> 58:32.461
Over on Drummond.

58:34.052 --> 58:35.052
No, no.

58:35.637 --> 58:38.050
My neighbour knows the family.
This is a big mistake.

58:38.724 --> 58:41.137
Do you understand these rights
as I've read them?

58:41.476 --> 58:42.476
Of course I do.

58:42.561 --> 58:43.847
Can we come in?

58:44.354 --> 58:45.354
Sure.

58:45.564 --> 58:47.180
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

58:47.816 --> 58:49.616
- Can you step over here?
- This is a mistake.

58:49.818 --> 58:52.401
- You don't have any guns?
- No, I don't.

58:52.738 --> 58:54.604
You won't mind if the officers
search here?

58:54.948 --> 58:58.487
I didn't do anything. This is my house.
I was just doing the books.

58:58.827 --> 59:01.365
I don't even know why
you people are here.

59:01.705 --> 59:03.196
That's Cecil.

59:06.585 --> 59:08.201
That's Cecil Lockhart.

59:09.129 --> 59:10.836
You know her from television?

59:11.923 --> 59:13.960
Why do you have a picture
of Cecil Lockhart?

59:19.306 --> 59:20.422
She was my wife.

59:24.895 --> 59:27.137
Cecil gave birth in 1985...

59:27.481 --> 59:29.598
which is the same year Ben was born.

59:29.941 --> 59:32.649
Apparently, the baby had
complications and died.

59:32.986 --> 59:35.979
She had a nervous breakdown.
They had to put her away.

59:36.323 --> 59:39.157
She got out three years after that,
just in time...

59:39.493 --> 59:43.612
to make it to the reunion,
where she saw Ben and snatched him.

59:43.955 --> 59:45.491
She disappeared into Minneapolis...

59:45.832 --> 59:47.619
where she met George and married him.

59:47.959 --> 59:49.495
He adopted Ben...

59:49.836 --> 59:51.247
and then they moved here.

59:51.588 --> 59:54.956
About five years ago,
she committed suicide.

59:57.886 --> 01:00:00.253
I got to tell you, I feel...

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.429
totally responsible...

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.632
for a lot of what's happened.

01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:07.059
We interviewed this woman.

01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:10.638
I sat in this woman's house.
I had tea with her.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.894
And somewhere in there was Ben...

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:14.851
and I missed him.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:19.235
George Karras wasn't at all
suspicious, and he adopted Ben.

01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:21.236
So she lied to her husband.

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:22.942
She lied to me.

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:27.242
I'm supposed to know when people
are lying because I'm a supercop.

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:32.581
I didn't find him.
You guys did.

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.083
No one found him.

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:36.964
He found us.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.045
Are you heading to
the foster home now?

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.177
What will you say to him?

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:47.099
How's it feel to get your son back?

01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:50.178
Did you contact him at all
in the last two weeks?

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.313
Will you call him Ben or Sam?

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:57.735
Do you have any statement to make?

01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:57.415
How are you?

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:00.794
I'm good.

01:02:05.597 --> 01:02:06.597
Dad?

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:08.131
- Yes?
- Yeah, Sam?

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:30.579
Stop fidgeting.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:35.291
You're not hungry?

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:36.627
I'm eating.

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:39.294
I'm not an industrial vacuum,
like some people.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:50.843
Could I have some milk?

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:52.425
You do milk with pizza?

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.520
I like milk with pizza.

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.399
- Good night, Kerry.
- Good night, Mom.

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.039
Do you want the light on?

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:17.871
No, I don't sleep with a light.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:22.584
Do you want an extra
blanket or anything?

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:24.172
I'm okay.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.424
The Bulls are home tomorrow.
Do you want to go?

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:40.274
Good night.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:58.332
I'll put an extra blanket there,
just in case.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:00.204
If he needs one,
he'll ask for it.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:02.832
He doesn't know how cold
this house gets.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:04.914
Please relax, honey. Okay?

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.215
- Relax. He's home.
- Oh, God.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.839
I just want to go in and look at him.

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:46.807
Here, just wear these.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:48.268
I hate those.

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:51.520
You loved those socks three days ago.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.778
It's not for church. I want tights.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:58.236
Pick out whatever you want, but hurry.
I have to get dressed.

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.617
Why doesn't he like us?

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:02.740
- Who?
- Ben.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.460
Sam.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.327
He does.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.959
It's just, he's...

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.174
Even though he's your brother...

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.096
this is all very new for him.

01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:20.224
He just needs time to..

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.640
He just needs time
to get used to us.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.687
And we have to help him, okay?

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:30.194
Hurry.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:52.498
Today, we celebrate
the presence among us...

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:54.208
in their wholeness...

01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:56.635
of the Cappadora family.

01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:59.839
As you all know, their son Ben
was taken from them...

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.043
and, by what can only be called...

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:06.304
a modern-day miracle,
returned to them just weeks ago...

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:09.895
not maimed, not torn...

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:12.397
but healthy and whole.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.979
I ask you to join with them today...

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:17.815
in their gratitude and their faith.

01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:20.192
I'm also asked to remind you...

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.950
of the celebration
at Cappadora's Restaurant...

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:24.530
immediately following the mass.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:36.593
Are you okay?

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:38.089
Yeah, Dad.

01:07:39.764 --> 01:07:42.006
- I'm so happy for you!
- Thank you, Susan.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:43.761
Congratulations!

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:49.062
That's the big brother.

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:01.942
I want us all to walk in together.

01:08:02.287 --> 01:08:04.779
Yes, Mom.
The perfect family.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:35.563
Welcome home.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.148
Thank you.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:38.899
The table's here.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:06.469
Loosen up, man.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:17.810
I'll show you something.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.363
This is called the tarantella.

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:31.698
It's an Italian dance.
You want to learn it?

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:33.375
You can learn it.

01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:37.462
I don't know this dance.
I only know the Hasapiko.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:40.462
- You'll have to say it again.
- Hasapiko.

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:42.589
Hey, guys, can you hold it?

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:44.716
My son doesn't know the tarantella...

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:47.594
but he knows the Hasapiko.
You know it?

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:50.017
- Of course.
- Great!

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.451
I better go up there.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.840
Put your arm out.

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:21.964
Come over here.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.222
Ready?

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.841
Right, back...

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:32.346
right, together.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.265
Left, together.

01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:37.313
Right, back, right, together.

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:53.386
Yes, Mr. Karras?

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:56.844
I came to bring you Sam's records.

01:11:57.897 --> 01:11:59.104
Photos.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.275
This is his...

01:12:03.611 --> 01:12:05.147
medical chart.

01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:08.650
This is his dental.

01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:13.657
One cavity in his permanent teeth
when he was 10.

01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:18.122
Report cards...

01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:21.789
You'll see.

01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:24.834
A little trouble in math.

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:30.711
You know, this...

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:33.509
This was my wife...

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:35.136
and my son.

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:39.812
This wasn't some lunatic
and the boy she kidnapped.

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:42.397
Not to me.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:45.861
Good night.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:00.991
What did he want?

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.808
We missed a lot of years.

01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:39.204
Where you been playing?

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:40.498
City League.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.491
Travelling squad.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:43.835
First string.

01:13:44.045 --> 01:13:45.206
Travelling squad?

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:46.546
My goodness!

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:47.714
Hey, I'm in sixth.

01:13:48.049 --> 01:13:49.756
Most of the other guys are in ninth.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.092
It's all about height.

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:52.886
Yeah, sure.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.426
Play Horse?

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:05.431
- That was pretty.
- Not bad.

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:08.234
You on varsity?

01:14:09.654 --> 01:14:10.895
I will be.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.435
Coach is such an asshole, though.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:17.452
Okay, free throw.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:24.412
- Right here?
- Wherever.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:37.845
That's an "H".
Get ready for this one.

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:43.969
That's an "O".

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.561
I thought this was Horse.

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:47.764
Okay, buddy.

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:49.401
Ready to go downtown?

01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:50.928
Wait a second. It's not your shot.

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:52.648
This ain't the city rec, Ben.

01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:54.406
It's not "Ben".

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:55.490
Okay...

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:56.658
Ben.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:05.039
What are we playing to now?

01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:06.376
Just play.

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:18.253
Ever seen that
in the city rec, Sammy?

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:20.390
In girls'.

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:26.021
Oh, shit!

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:28.313
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:31.316
- What's wrong with you?
- Jesus Christ, Dad!

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:32.652
Are you okay? Sure?

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.489
Can you go one day without
making some kind of trouble?

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:39.194
What happened to him?

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:41.781
What do you care?

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:44.492
We were just playing ball.

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:47.828
Really. We were just having fun.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.192
And that's Vincent's.

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:16.112
See?

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.443
It's his christening gown.

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:25.829
This is what we brought him home
from the hospital in.

01:16:29.043 --> 01:16:30.534
Do you want to see yours?

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:46.553
They're so little.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.931
They look like doll clothes.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:56.772
- What's that smell?
- It's cedar.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:58.820
It's from the chest.

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:01.318
It's supposed to keep moths away.

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:03.366
Haven't you ever smelled it before?

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.994
Maybe my grandmother
had a chest like this.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:11.626
What?

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:20.459
Are you remembering something?

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:27.136
Beth, can I see my dad today?

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:29.892
I really want to see him.

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:34.939
Sure.

01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:53.746
I already told you. That's why
I want to go to my grandma's.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:56.794
It's what I do for Thanksgiving
every year of my life.

01:17:57.131 --> 01:17:58.622
It's a very special day for us.

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:01.875
It's a very special day for us too.

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:04.302
My cousins come, my grandma cooks...

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:05.970
the whole week before.

01:18:06.307 --> 01:18:08.594
After turkey,
we go outside and play football.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:10.425
When we come in,
we have pie...

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:12.101
and watch TV with my dad.

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:14.851
The whole family is coming.

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:16.898
Grandma Rosie, Grandpa Angelo..

01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:19.100
No! I'm not staying here.

01:18:20.571 --> 01:18:21.982
Why do I have to care about them?

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:23.985
You never even met my grandma.

01:18:24.325 --> 01:18:25.406
You don't like my dad.

01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:27.224
You don't care about what he thinks.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:30.157
Of course we like George, Sam.

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:32.409
Then let me spend
Thanksgiving with him.

01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:35.996
The fact is, you're our son.

01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:39.956
Not George's. This is one thing
we're doing as a family.

01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:43.007
- And it's not negotiable.
- You just want to show me off.

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:49.718
I'm sorry.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:51.425
I didn't mean that.

01:18:56.774 --> 01:18:58.481
Life magazine!
I can't believe...

01:18:58.817 --> 01:18:59.817
the work you're getting.

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:01.692
You know why I'm getting the work.

01:19:02.029 --> 01:19:03.486
Because you're the best, kiddo.

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:04.822
Yeah, right.

01:19:04.949 --> 01:19:06.781
Same reason Pat's
restaurant's always full...

01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:09.074
and Vincent's
got a lot of new friends.

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:11.528
Are you saying it's the celebrity?

01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:14.038
I think the word is "notoriety".

01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:17.038
Where are we eating?
And more to the point, drinking?

01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:18.378
Do you like clams?

01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:19.626
Go this way.

01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:24.583
How's it going with Vincent and Sam?

01:19:30.557 --> 01:19:34.392
Vincent's so busy getting ready for
the basketball tryouts...

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:37.478
he's ignoring everyone.

01:19:37.815 --> 01:19:39.932
Sam probably thinks...

01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:44.106
I don't know what Sam thinks.
He's still so...

01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:46.730
uncomfortable...

01:19:47.074 --> 01:19:50.363
all the time now.
His grades are falling apart.

01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:52.489
I don't know.

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:54.662
Well, what's Pat say?

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:58.492
You know Pat.
He thinks Sam's going to be fine.

01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:01.294
He thinks everything's
going to be fine.

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:03.163
And what do you think?

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.507
I don't know.

01:20:10.597 --> 01:20:12.589
It's just going to take some time.

01:20:23.027 --> 01:20:26.737
Do you know what the
great Chicago fire of 1871 is?

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:31.358
Peshtigo, there was
an even worse fire...

01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:33.318
in the same year on the same day.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:36.363
Every single building
in the town burned.

01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:37.707
Hundreds of people died.

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:39.202
But Chicago was a big city...

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:41.830
so that's the fire
everybody paid attention to.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.547
There's a beautiful graveyard.
I want to get some shots.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:03.894
Basically...

01:21:04.234 --> 01:21:08.023
it's the story of what happened.
What we talked about in the car.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:18.864
Look at this, Sam.
He was only 14 years old.

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.824
That must've been so sad.

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:24.377
But look, 1869.

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.830
He died two years before the fire.

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:29.629
Maybe he killed himself,
like my mom.

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:31.801
I mean, Cecilia.

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:36.843
Why do you think that?

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:38.766
Here, look through here.

01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:43.437
Like, for Cecilia,
I think she was just too sad.

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:46.607
So maybe this guy was...

01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:48.685
too sad too, you know?

01:21:49.029 --> 01:21:50.145
What do you mean?

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:53.906
There could be worse things
than being dead.

01:21:56.703 --> 01:21:57.703
Like what?

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:05.872
You know how much we love you.

01:22:06.213 --> 01:22:07.499
Yeah, I know you do...

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.127
and Pat and Kerry.

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:11.833
And Vincent too.

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:14.095
Yeah, right.

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:16.755
Really, he's like that with all of us.

01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:21.016
He's had a hard time.

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:22.848
What about me?

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.021
I love my dad.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:27.353
And I loved my mom too.

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:29.483
She didn't mean to be sick.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:32.779
Why do I have to be punished
when it wasn't my fault?

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:46.084
Do you know how much
I've missed holding you...

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.252
all these years?

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:52.040
And how many years
you didn't have me to hug you?

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.259
They hugged me.

01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:58.968
They hugged me all the time.

01:23:14.072 --> 01:23:15.529
Sam, what do you wish?

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:19.821
You can say.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:23.663
That everything was
like it was before.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:28.335
But that would hurt you and Pat,
and I couldn't stand that either.

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:32.255
I don't know.

01:23:56.907 --> 01:23:58.614
- Sam's gone.
- What do you mean?

01:23:58.951 --> 01:24:01.238
He's not in his room.
I can't find him.

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:04.408
- Did you look downstairs?
- He's not there. I can't find him.

01:24:04.748 --> 01:24:07.108
- Did you talk to Vincent?
- He's asleep. His door's locked.

01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:09.459
- What about Kerry?
- She's asleep too.

01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:25.721
I'm sorry.
He did it again.

01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:29.105
What'd he do?

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:31.852
He's been sneaking out
and coming to my house.

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:34.400
He crawls into his old bed
and sleeps.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.403
Vincent told me he knew all about it.

01:24:38.991 --> 01:24:41.074
- You knew?
- I brought him back, didn't I?

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:45.115
How long has this been going on?

01:24:45.455 --> 01:24:46.741
Not that long.

01:24:47.165 --> 01:24:49.205
I had a feeling something
was wrong, so this time...

01:24:49.293 --> 01:24:50.333
I brought him back myself.

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:52.622
You knew and didn't tell me?

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:54.371
He's home, okay?

01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:55.956
This time, anyhow.

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:00.755
- Go up to your room.
- Why?

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.338
- What did I do?
- You ran away!

01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:05.469
You scared the hell
out of your mom and me!

01:25:05.851 --> 01:25:07.888
That's not going to happen.
You understand me?

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:10.971
No, I don't understand.
I'm sick of this whole thing!

01:25:11.315 --> 01:25:15.025
I don't see why I have to live
two blocks from my own house.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.067
I've been trying for three months.

01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:18.861
Three months!

01:25:19.406 --> 01:25:21.648
You want me to come home,
Dad, right?

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:23.159
Come on, tell them.

01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:29.660
He's been asking me
why can't he live with me.

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:32.580
I told him what
his mother did was very wrong.

01:25:32.919 --> 01:25:34.501
She didn't know what she was doing.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:36.374
She was sick.

01:25:38.008 --> 01:25:40.671
We know how hard
this has been for you.

01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:42.798
We know how much you miss George.

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:44.845
But this is your home.

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:47.340
Sam, go upstairs now.

01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:49.644
I hate you.

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.020
I hate all of you!

01:25:51.355 --> 01:25:53.813
You too, Dad,
and I'm never coming back!

01:25:59.196 --> 01:26:01.358
Jesus, I want to do right by him.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.483
I want him to be happy.

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.658
If you can give him
the family he deserves...

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:08.660
goddamn it, you give him that!

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:14.917
But I've never seen him
like this before.

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:17.999
He's never been sad more than
a day in his life.

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:21.257
Right now, he's the saddest boy
in the world.

01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:01.964
You know, what happened last night,
that's just the tip of it.

01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:10.427
I'm going to say this just once.

01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:11.767
I love you.

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:15.474
I've been in love with you
your whole life.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:18.021
But you know what
I've seen about you?

01:27:19.443 --> 01:27:21.275
You've made a career
out of being unhappy.

01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:24.399
- That is not fair.
- But I'm not like that.

01:27:25.657 --> 01:27:28.775
If I have a chance to be happy,
I'm going to be happy.

01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:32.945
Can't you just try
and let us all be happy?

01:27:33.623 --> 01:27:34.623
What about Sam?

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:36.616
Just keep being a mother to him.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.167
Help him get through this.

01:27:38.503 --> 01:27:40.415
He doesn't know who we are.

01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:43.210
He doesn't remember us.

01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:47.797
We are holding him against his will.

01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:49.504
Where are you going with this?

01:27:49.973 --> 01:27:52.761
If you think I'm going to
lose my kid again..

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:55.138
I can't ignore that
because you finally...

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:57.471
have your life the way you want it.

01:27:57.939 --> 01:27:59.896
It's like we are the kidnappers now.

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:01.440
We're not the kidnappers!

01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:03.769
Sam will be fine.
He'll get through this.

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.112
It's you!

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:07.863
Losing your kid once
wasn't enough, was it?

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.316
You know something?

01:28:09.826 --> 01:28:10.826
You're right.

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:13.319
I wasn't there.
I let it happen.

01:28:13.789 --> 01:28:16.873
It only took a minute,
and we've paid for it.

01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:18.700
I have and you have...

01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:22.162
and Vincent has,
but I don't think that means...

01:28:22.506 --> 01:28:25.089
that Sam has to pay for it too.
Does it?

01:28:26.343 --> 01:28:28.380
We are where we are.

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:31.630
How we got here doesn't matter.
What matters is...

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.011
what do we do now?

01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:41.522
Don't push me on this, Beth.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:46.443
I want to give him back.

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:49.063
I can't do that.

01:28:52.702 --> 01:28:55.866
Then I want you to let me do
what I have to do.

01:30:27.297 --> 01:30:29.334
Can you get your bags okay?

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:08.080
I'll try Jay again,
but if we can't get him out...

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:10.783
for the weekend,
I won't have a problem.

01:33:11.127 --> 01:33:12.834
Don't you think
he's been through enough?

01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:14.611
Something's got to
get his attention.

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:17.047
Maybe he's doing this to get
your attention.

01:33:17.383 --> 01:33:19.875
Candy, he's always had my attention.

01:33:30.105 --> 01:33:32.518
He is so angry with me.

01:33:34.067 --> 01:33:35.558
Things are really bad.

01:33:35.902 --> 01:33:38.269
I know.
But I think he's right about Vincent.

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:40.821
I can't win with Vincent.
He hates me.

01:33:41.157 --> 01:33:44.776
He doesn't hate you. What are you
talking about? He loves you.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.737
Have you never seen the way
that he looks at you?

01:33:48.081 --> 01:33:50.164
All he wants you to do
is to forgive him.

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.707
Forgive him?

01:33:52.335 --> 01:33:56.796
For all the shit he's pulled and
the shit you don't know he's pulled.

01:33:57.132 --> 01:34:00.671
He's so much like you.
He takes everything onto himself.

01:34:01.719 --> 01:34:04.507
How do you think he's
feeling now that Sam is gone?

01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:42.006
You okay?

01:34:42.719 --> 01:34:43.960
I'm fine.

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:50.599
Do you need anything?

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:54.353
I think you'll have to
stay here another day or so.

01:34:54.689 --> 01:34:55.689
It's the weekend.

01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.021
I'm fine.

01:34:58.818 --> 01:35:00.480
Headache. It's no big deal.

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.657
Do you know how lucky you were?

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:10.532
Mr. Teeter's car was totalled.

01:35:11.247 --> 01:35:14.331
- You could've been..
- I don't need this right now.

01:35:16.085 --> 01:35:17.201
What are you doing here?

01:35:18.213 --> 01:35:20.546
I've been doing fine without you.

01:35:23.927 --> 01:35:26.169
I don't think you have been.

01:35:29.057 --> 01:35:30.298
I'm sorry.

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:57.867
We're going to get you out of here.

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:00.911
Dad's working on it.

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:17.811
Pat? Jay just called.

01:36:18.147 --> 01:36:21.015
He says we can pick Vincent up
in the morning.

01:36:21.776 --> 01:36:24.109
All right. Thank you.

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:40.993
Can't we get past this?

01:36:43.423 --> 01:36:45.460
This isn't just about losing Sam.

01:36:46.968 --> 01:36:48.709
What is it about?

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:50.673
Listen to me.

01:36:51.889 --> 01:36:53.972
The Sam that's in your head...

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:55.766
he doesn't exist.

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.682
The family that's in your head...

01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:01.270
doesn't exist either.

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:04.399
This family is not in my head.

01:37:04.736 --> 01:37:06.352
It's very real.

01:37:06.696 --> 01:37:07.777
It's you and me...

01:37:08.114 --> 01:37:09.114
and Kerry and Vincent.

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:11.820
After what he pulled,
I pray I find a way...

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.447
to get him through high school
in one piece...

01:37:14.787 --> 01:37:17.905
and get him to believe he can
get through life without fouling up!

01:37:18.249 --> 01:37:19.365
You are right.

01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:22.702
You're right about Vincent,
but you're wrong about Sam.

01:37:23.046 --> 01:37:26.005
You don't know him.
You don't want to know him.

01:37:28.009 --> 01:37:30.752
And you don't know me anymore either.

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.345
I have known you..

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:35.718
Part of you liked it
when I was falling apart...

01:37:36.059 --> 01:37:38.051
and you were holding
this family together...

01:37:38.770 --> 01:37:40.887
making the decisions.
But now...

01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:43.438
I don't need you
to pull me out of bed...

01:37:43.775 --> 01:37:45.892
and make me pay attention
to the kids.

01:37:49.197 --> 01:37:50.563
I have to go to work.

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:53.482
But I do need you.

01:37:54.494 --> 01:37:55.494
Why?

01:37:55.578 --> 01:37:56.944
Tell me what for.

01:37:58.206 --> 01:37:59.993
I need you to love me.

01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:18.557
You got a visitor.

01:38:19.394 --> 01:38:21.932
Everyone I've ever met
in my life has already been here.

01:38:22.271 --> 01:38:23.271
Name's Sam Karras.

01:38:24.774 --> 01:38:26.436
You gonna see him or not?

01:38:40.123 --> 01:38:41.123
So...

01:38:41.624 --> 01:38:42.740
you okay?

01:38:43.209 --> 01:38:45.747
They gave me 5 to 10.
But I'm reasonably okay.

01:38:46.212 --> 01:38:47.419
I'm kidding.

01:38:48.965 --> 01:38:49.965
Were you drunk?

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:52.291
I was over-served.

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.843
Yeah, Sam, I was drunk.

01:38:55.847 --> 01:38:57.008
So what do you want?

01:38:58.683 --> 01:39:00.015
I just thought...

01:39:01.269 --> 01:39:03.261
I thought we could be friends.

01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:05.021
Friends?

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:07.768
Tell me how we can be friends.

01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:10.268
You come back. You leave.

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:11.897
You go in and out our window.

01:39:12.238 --> 01:39:13.445
I don't know you, Ben.

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:15.898
Sam! Whatever your name is.

01:39:16.367 --> 01:39:18.450
You're a concept. You follow me?

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.527
- That's not my fault.
- "Not my fault!"

01:39:20.872 --> 01:39:24.081
You always whine about
whose fault it is. Who cares?

01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:26.954
Look, I got my own life now.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:31.288
It's pretty un-fun at the moment.
Tell me what you want.

01:39:33.217 --> 01:39:34.549
You're my brother.

01:39:35.428 --> 01:39:36.544
I missed you.

01:39:38.014 --> 01:39:40.677
Sometimes, I even thought
I shouldn't have.

01:39:42.935 --> 01:39:44.722
Whatever, you're my brother.

01:39:48.441 --> 01:39:50.103
You should go now, Sam.

01:39:51.527 --> 01:39:53.519
I'm sorry. You're a good kid.

01:39:53.863 --> 01:39:55.229
You're fine, but I'm..

01:39:56.282 --> 01:39:59.491
- Maybe I'll visit you when I'm out..
- Wait!

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:02.410
I gotta tell you something.

01:40:03.915 --> 01:40:05.702
I remembered something.

01:40:06.292 --> 01:40:07.292
What do you mean?

01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:10.161
Well, when I was at your house...

01:40:10.505 --> 01:40:12.497
Beth showed me this old trunk.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.502
It was full of old baby clothes.

01:40:15.051 --> 01:40:16.542
I didn't remember anything.

01:40:16.886 --> 01:40:18.172
Yeah. So?

01:40:18.721 --> 01:40:20.132
But I remembered the smell.

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:22.388
From being inside the trunk.

01:40:22.975 --> 01:40:24.182
Hide-and-seek.

01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:28.562
Did that really happen?

01:40:28.898 --> 01:40:29.898
Yeah.

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:33.441
You let the lid shut and it caught.

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:36.023
I knew it.

01:40:36.489 --> 01:40:37.821
I knew it!

01:40:38.366 --> 01:40:40.198
Finally, you came
and opened the top.

01:40:40.535 --> 01:40:42.026
You were just there.

01:40:43.663 --> 01:40:45.325
Not scared or anything.

01:40:45.665 --> 01:40:47.372
See? That's what I remember.

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:48.750
What?

01:40:48.918 --> 01:40:50.500
That I wasn't scared.

01:40:51.087 --> 01:40:52.999
Because I knew you'd come
and find me.

01:41:30.585 --> 01:41:32.167
What the hell are you doing?

01:41:33.796 --> 01:41:34.796
Nothing.

01:41:35.214 --> 01:41:36.214
Want to play?

01:41:36.382 --> 01:41:39.045
It's midnight and it's cold,
in case you haven't noticed.

01:41:40.261 --> 01:41:41.261
Yeah. So?

01:41:42.179 --> 01:41:45.092
Jesus, Sam!
Does George know you're here?

01:41:45.808 --> 01:41:46.808
Yeah.

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:47.934
Come on down.

01:41:48.603 --> 01:41:50.970
You just want to get me
arrested again, don't you?

01:41:51.314 --> 01:41:53.180
Ever heard of disturbing the peace?

01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:56.976
We could play quiet.

01:41:58.613 --> 01:42:00.275
What's the matter? Come on!

01:42:02.283 --> 01:42:03.283
All right.

01:42:19.467 --> 01:42:20.799
What are you waiting for?

01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:22.751
- Easy, Sam.
- All right.

01:42:23.095 --> 01:42:25.462
Losers out to 11, win by 2?

01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:28.677
What's the matter?
You asleep or something?

01:42:36.651 --> 01:42:37.937
This way?

01:42:38.277 --> 01:42:39.438
Which way?

01:42:40.696 --> 01:42:42.062
Quit fouling me!

01:43:02.718 --> 01:43:05.426
You got to say, "beat".
You are beat, right?

01:43:06.138 --> 01:43:07.470
I let you.

01:43:08.182 --> 01:43:09.263
Sure.

01:43:10.017 --> 01:43:11.098
Let's call it a night.

01:43:11.894 --> 01:43:13.886
Come back tomorrow for a rematch.

01:43:15.564 --> 01:43:18.773
Well, the thing is, I'm not going back.

01:43:21.570 --> 01:43:22.606
What do you mean?

01:43:26.992 --> 01:43:28.153
What are you doing?

01:43:29.161 --> 01:43:30.572
George knows.

01:43:31.372 --> 01:43:33.455
We talked about it
a lot last week.

01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:35.786
He knows why
I came here so late.

01:43:36.127 --> 01:43:37.334
Which is why?

01:43:38.462 --> 01:43:41.296
I didn't want to have this
whole big thing with you...

01:43:41.632 --> 01:43:43.624
and Beth and Pat.

01:43:46.804 --> 01:43:47.920
Sam?

01:43:50.808 --> 01:43:52.674
Is this permanent?

01:43:53.811 --> 01:43:55.052
I don't know.

01:43:56.188 --> 01:43:57.520
I mean, maybe.

01:43:58.482 --> 01:43:59.814
If I can.

01:44:07.992 --> 01:44:10.905
Jesus, what is this,
your cinder block collection?

01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:20.577
I was the one.

01:44:22.214 --> 01:44:24.001
I let go of your hand.

01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:28.126
This thing is heavy.

01:44:28.679 --> 01:44:29.679
My dad..

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:32.468
- George helped me carry it.
- Did you hear what I said?

01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:35.892
Yeah. So what?

01:44:36.771 --> 01:44:38.558
I let go of your hand, Sam.

01:44:40.274 --> 01:44:41.981
I told you to get lost.
That's what I said.

01:44:42.318 --> 01:44:44.776
- I said, "Get lost!"
- Big deal.

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:48.230
Everybody says stuff like that.
"Get lost!"

01:44:50.034 --> 01:44:52.151
Here's the deal.
Make it-take it to 11.

01:44:52.495 --> 01:44:54.077
Gotta win by two.

01:44:54.789 --> 01:44:56.246
Loser carries it up alone.

01:44:59.376 --> 01:45:00.708
Come on, man!

01:45:01.045 --> 01:45:02.627

01:45:04.507 --> 01:45:05.623
Come on, let's go.

01:45:09.053 --> 01:45:11.215

01:45:23.859 --> 01:45:25.816
Let's get some sleep.

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:42.287

01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:49.212
I'm just warming up.
