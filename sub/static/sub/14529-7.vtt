00:05.638 --> 00:08.040
(narrator)
Previously...

00:08.042 --> 00:10.175
on "The Making of
the Mob: New York"...

00:11.444 --> 00:15.014
For nearly a decade,
Charles "Lucky" Luciano

00:15.016 --> 00:19.018
has run his criminal empire
from a maximum-security prison.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.086
But the outbreak
of World War II...

00:21.088 --> 00:25.391
(President Roosevelt)
<i>A date which will live</i>
<i>in infamy.</i>

00:25.393 --> 00:28.227
...has given him
the opportunity to get out.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.762
You'll never guess
who I got a call from.

00:29.764 --> 00:32.131
Who?
The FBI.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.234
(narrator)
From behind bars,
Luciano strikes deals

00:35.236 --> 00:38.037
with the FBI
and the U.S. Navy...

00:38.039 --> 00:41.240
Well, listen, sir,
just because we're businessmen,

00:41.242 --> 00:42.641
doesn't mean
we're not patriots.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.576
We'll lock down the docks.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.345
...using the Mafia's control
of the waterfront

00:46.347 --> 00:48.680
to gain leverage
with the government.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.682
Come on, let's go,
we can move faster.

00:50.684 --> 00:54.319
(narrator)
But Luciano's former acting
boss, Vito Genovese,

00:54.321 --> 00:56.488
becomes a major problem...
(door banging)

00:56.490 --> 00:59.792
Freeze!
Freeze! Don't move,
don't move, don't move!

00:59.794 --> 01:02.094
...when he's arrested
in Italy

01:02.096 --> 01:04.263
and sent back to New York
on a murder rap.

01:04.265 --> 01:08.067
He's gonna testify.
How could you be so stupid?

01:08.069 --> 01:10.202
(narrator)
With a witness
lined up to testify,

01:10.204 --> 01:12.104
Luciano orders a hit...

01:12.106 --> 01:14.640
Time for your daily dose.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.776
(coughing)
...that saves Genovese,

01:17.778 --> 01:21.113
but does nothing to earn
Luciano his freedom.

01:21.115 --> 01:25.217
(Luciano)
When will we know?
That's up to Dewey.

01:25.219 --> 01:28.620
(narrator)
Finally, Thomas Dewey
lets Luciano out of prison,

01:28.622 --> 01:30.656
but at a steep price.

01:30.658 --> 01:33.358
They're deporting you...
to Italy.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.563
(Luciano)
You came all this way
to see me go.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.798
(narrator)
Now, Luciano will
have to figure out

01:39.800 --> 01:42.468
how to keep control
of the American Mafia...

01:42.470 --> 01:44.336
Come visit me
sometime, huh?

01:44.338 --> 01:47.139
...from 4,000 miles away.

01:48.875 --> 01:52.878
â™ª

01:52.880 --> 01:56.115
(man)
â™ª This ain't no time

01:56.117 --> 01:59.351
â™ª To feel sorry
for myself â™ª

01:59.353 --> 02:03.355
â™ª I can't help it

02:03.357 --> 02:07.126
â™ª 'Cause there's nobody else

02:07.128 --> 02:10.295
â™ª And
I walk these streets â™ª

02:10.297 --> 02:13.665
â™ª With your name
on my tongue â™ª

02:13.667 --> 02:16.835
â™ª But I dare not speak

02:16.837 --> 02:19.271
â™ª Only
there it belongs â™ª

02:21.541 --> 02:26.345
â™ª There's got to be
a better way â™ª

02:26.347 --> 02:27.746
â™ª Better way

02:27.748 --> 02:29.848
(gunshot echoes)

02:35.588 --> 02:37.656
(church bell tolling)

02:41.227 --> 02:43.295
â™ª

02:47.901 --> 02:50.469
(door squeaking)

02:56.276 --> 02:58.210
(narrator)
After 10 years in prison,

02:58.212 --> 03:00.846
Lucky Luciano
is finally a free man.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.617
But he's been exiled to Italy

03:05.619 --> 03:09.254
and told he can never
return to America.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.461
In the 40 years

03:16.463 --> 03:19.898
since Luciano arrived
in the United States,

03:19.900 --> 03:23.502
the no-name
Sicilian immigrant

03:23.504 --> 03:25.571
has become a legend.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.574
Creating a criminal empire

03:28.576 --> 03:31.310
alongside the friends
he's had for decades.

03:34.614 --> 03:37.449
(Joe Mantegna)
Lucky Luciano is
a Sicilian immigrant

03:37.451 --> 03:40.252
and actually fits
that perfect mold of a guy

03:40.254 --> 03:42.688
who comes to this country.

03:42.690 --> 03:46.592
It's almost like achieving
the American dream, but...

03:46.594 --> 03:48.527
the dark side as opposed
to the light side.

03:50.597 --> 03:53.532
(narrator)
Now, Luciano's been forced
to leave the future

03:53.534 --> 03:57.236
of the American Mafia
in the hands of his crew.

04:02.308 --> 04:05.244
(seagull calling)

04:05.246 --> 04:07.713
Nothing's changed,
gentlemen.

04:08.781 --> 04:11.350
Lucky's still
calling the shots.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.953
You're being modest,
Frank.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.788
Of course,
he is.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.323
He's a modest guy.

04:18.325 --> 04:22.494
(narrator)
With Luciano 4,000 miles away,

04:22.496 --> 04:26.698
Frank Costello is the acting
boss of Luciano's family

04:26.700 --> 04:29.968
and must keep the peace between
the five New York crime families

04:29.970 --> 04:31.703
run by gangsters

04:31.705 --> 04:35.374
like Joe Bonanno
and Joe Profaci.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.908
You have our confidence.

04:44.717 --> 04:47.986
(narrator)
The man Costello replaced,
Vito Genovese,

04:47.988 --> 04:50.389
has been released from prison

04:50.391 --> 04:53.325
only to find himself demoted

04:53.327 --> 04:55.394
within the organization.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.840
What's on your mind, Vito?

05:08.842 --> 05:11.643
How do we make things right
between me and Charlie?

05:13.613 --> 05:16.915
I think you're talking
to the wrong guy.

05:19.085 --> 05:22.854
He's got me running the street
gang like some punk.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.424
That's not right.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.792
It's out of my hands.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.727
I thought you was
in charge here?

05:28.729 --> 05:30.962
Do you want me to go
over Charlie's head?

05:32.598 --> 05:35.000
He's making me
look like a fool.

05:39.038 --> 05:42.107
(Selwyn Raab)
Vito Genovese was
very envious.

05:44.877 --> 05:47.446
He felt that he had been
short-changed,

05:47.448 --> 05:50.415
weren't getting all the benefits
and all the wealth.

05:50.417 --> 05:53.452
And it was no question

05:53.454 --> 05:57.089
that he was an archrival
of Costello.

05:57.091 --> 06:00.125
(narrator)
While Costello deals
with Genovese,

06:00.127 --> 06:03.061
Meyer Lansky is overseeing
an aggressive plan

06:03.063 --> 06:05.497
to expand the Luciano empire

06:05.499 --> 06:08.800
outside the United States.

06:12.438 --> 06:14.072
It's nice being close
to the sea.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.774
We have the same thing
in New York,

06:15.776 --> 06:17.843
but it's nothing like this.
You have Coney Island.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.978
We have Coney Island.
(chuckling)

06:19.980 --> 06:23.014
(narrator)
Meyer Lansky has
spent years paying off

06:23.016 --> 06:27.753
powerful Cuban politician
Fulgencio Batista.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.589
Toast.

06:30.591 --> 06:34.393
To a beautiful future
in a beautiful place.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.595
(Meyer Lansky II)
My grandfather loved Cuba.

06:36.597 --> 06:40.165
He loved the Cuban people.
He loved the weather.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.167
Hopefully we'll be spending
a lot of time down here.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.802
(Lansky II)
Batista knew that
my grandfather

06:43.804 --> 06:45.704
was known for being honest.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.105
He brought him over

06:47.107 --> 06:49.007
and he started
cleaning up the games.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.443
(man)
There we go. Big winner.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.949
(narrator)
With Batista on the payroll,

06:57.951 --> 06:59.785
Lansky moves forward
transforming

06:59.787 --> 07:03.622
Havana's seedy hotels
into five-star casinos...

07:05.525 --> 07:09.027
that had the potential to make
millions of dollars a day.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.500
(Rich Cohen)
Meyer Lansky wanted to be
a legitimate businessman.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.537
And he just knew
how to run a casino.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.039
I mean, the numbers, the odds,
how the house always wins.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.842
What games they should play,
how to take care of people.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.445
And his idea

07:26.447 --> 07:29.948
was really to do that
ultimately in Cuba.

07:34.854 --> 07:38.023
(narrator)
While Lansky's laying
the foundation in Cuba,

07:38.025 --> 07:40.225
Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel

07:40.227 --> 07:43.161
has set up a stronghold
for the family in California.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.864
Take good care of her, that's
what you could do for me, right?

07:45.866 --> 07:48.567
Thank you,
here we go.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.502
Hey, how we doing
over here, huh?

07:50.504 --> 07:52.204
(narrator)
Luciano's trusted hit man

07:52.206 --> 07:54.906
has been in Los Angeles
since the late '30s.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.175
He's infiltrated
the movie industry,

07:57.177 --> 08:01.213
using mob-run unions to gain
leverage with the studios.

08:01.215 --> 08:04.182
But after his years
of loyalty,

08:04.184 --> 08:08.086
Siegel still has nothing
to call his own.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.767
Lucky Luciano,
Vito Genovese,

08:22.769 --> 08:26.204
Frank Costello,
Meyer Lansky.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.708
Each of Siegel's childhood crew
has either been the boss

08:29.710 --> 08:32.878
or has had the freedom
to run his own operation.

08:35.114 --> 08:37.282
Siegel wants
to be remembered

08:37.284 --> 08:39.718
as more than just
a trigger man.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.654
He wants a lasting legacy.

08:45.591 --> 08:49.060
Siegel sees his opportunity
300 miles east

08:49.062 --> 08:51.897
in a stretch of
barren Nevada desert

08:51.899 --> 08:54.566
known as Las Vegas.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.935
(Oscar Goodman)
Las Vegas was a patch of sand.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.771
There weren't any buildings
taller than two stories high.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.940
It didn't have
any kind of a reputation.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.675
It was hard to get to.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.745
(narrator)
It may be a barren desert now,

09:06.747 --> 09:09.314
but Siegel sees
what no one else can,

09:09.316 --> 09:11.850
a gambling mecca.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.686
Nevada is one of
the few states in the country

09:14.688 --> 09:16.955
that has legalized gambling.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.925
(Siegel)
I've been having
this vision, right?

09:19.927 --> 09:23.094
And I look off into the dark
desert and see these lights.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.196
They're so bright that
they'll blind you, right?

09:25.198 --> 09:27.666
And I see people
and hotels

09:27.668 --> 09:30.802
and casinos and money.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.038
Lots
of money.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.173
(narrator)
Siegel's vision

09:35.175 --> 09:37.943
is a European-style
mega hotel and casino

09:37.945 --> 09:41.646
that will attract the Hollywood
crowd and the high rollers.

09:41.648 --> 09:44.115
And also bring in tourists
willing to cough up

09:44.117 --> 09:46.217
thousands of dollars
a night.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.322
Siegel names his hotel
after his nickname

09:50.324 --> 09:52.324
for his long-legged
girlfriend,

09:52.326 --> 09:55.160
Virginia Hill,
the Flamingo.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.697
(Goodman)
Bugsy Siegel saw
that the future

09:58.699 --> 10:01.700
of entertainment
and gambling

10:01.702 --> 10:03.668
and all that
Las Vegas stands for,

10:03.670 --> 10:06.237
as far as being an exciting
tourist destination,

10:06.239 --> 10:09.708
would be possible here
in this desert.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.043
(narrator)
But in order to
make his dream a reality,

10:12.045 --> 10:14.646
Siegel needs one thing...

10:14.648 --> 10:17.215
money.

10:17.217 --> 10:21.152
(Siegel)
<i>It's a little town</i>
<i>called Las Vegas.</i>

10:21.154 --> 10:23.321
(Luciano)
How much, Benny?

10:23.323 --> 10:25.991
<i>A million dollars. </i>
<i>A million dollars?</i>

10:25.993 --> 10:28.093
You want us to pump a million
dollars into the desert

10:28.095 --> 10:29.995
when we already got
casinos making money?

10:29.997 --> 10:33.164
<i>Yeah, 'cause there's</i>
<i>one major difference.</i>

10:33.166 --> 10:37.202
<i>Gambling in Vegas is legal.</i>

10:37.204 --> 10:39.371
<i>100%. </i>
<i>Legal, huh?</i>

10:39.373 --> 10:41.673
<i>I'm telling you, you got</i>
<i>people from L.A. coming over.</i>

10:41.675 --> 10:42.941
<i>You got people</i>
<i>from up North.</i>

10:42.943 --> 10:44.876
<i>Get the bigwig</i>
<i>movie stars out there,</i>

10:44.878 --> 10:46.778
<i>get some appearances going,</i>
<i>some press.</i>

10:46.780 --> 10:48.847
<i>I'm talking fancy casino.</i>

10:48.849 --> 10:51.016
<i>You know, nice restaurants,</i>
<i>good hotel rooms.</i>

10:51.018 --> 10:52.917
<i>It's a good investment,</i>
<i>right?</i>

10:52.919 --> 10:54.786
<i>You put that money in,</i>
<i>we get this thing going,</i>

10:54.788 --> 10:57.022
<i>we'll triple that profit</i>
<i>in a week.</i>

10:57.024 --> 10:59.391
<i>And, listen, I've stood</i>
<i>by you a long time.</i>

10:59.393 --> 11:01.860
<i>I think this is a good idea.</i>

11:01.862 --> 11:04.029
Well, you better
be right, Benny.

11:06.098 --> 11:10.035
(narrator)
Luciano pledges to help fund
his friend's Las Vegas dream.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.304
But he knows he'll need
an even bigger venture

11:13.306 --> 11:16.808
if he's going to maintain
his place in the Mafia.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.811
In the case of organized crime
figures, you have to be
successful.

11:19.813 --> 11:23.314
You have to make money.
You have to be imaginative.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.216
And if you're not
making money,

11:25.218 --> 11:28.186
you're gonna lose stature
in the family.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.169
(narrator)
During the war,
Vito Genovese made millions

11:44.171 --> 11:47.238
exporting Italy's legally
manufactured heroin

11:47.240 --> 11:50.141
to the United States.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.714
Now, Luciano seizes

11:55.716 --> 11:58.383
what's left of Genovese's
smuggling operation...

12:01.153 --> 12:03.321
and makes it his own.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.826
(Sal Polisi)
The drug business was huge.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.427
The amount of money
that you could make

12:09.429 --> 12:11.196
in one day with drugs,

12:11.198 --> 12:13.264
it would take you years
to make gambling.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.433
(narrator)
With heroin now illegal
in Italy,

12:15.435 --> 12:19.104
Luciano invests hundreds of
thousands of dollars

12:19.106 --> 12:21.940
converting Sicilian
candy factories

12:21.942 --> 12:24.442
into underground
heroin labs.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.779
(speaking Italian)

12:27.781 --> 12:29.180
(responding
in Italian)

12:29.182 --> 12:31.282
(narrator)
Luciano knows

12:31.284 --> 12:34.018
with his vast criminal network
in the United States,

12:34.020 --> 12:37.822
he already has a market
of millions of customers.

12:37.824 --> 12:40.992
All he needs now is a way
to smuggle the drugs

12:40.994 --> 12:44.362
into America undetected.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.431
â™ª

12:50.169 --> 12:53.171
Hey, wake up, your portrait's
in "The New York Times".
(chuckling)

12:53.173 --> 12:56.040
Uh... thank you.

12:57.376 --> 12:59.911
Charlie. Oh.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.147
So good to see you.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.815
Even if it is a pain
in the ass to get here.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.517
It's good to see you, too.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.786
(exhaling)
But don't unpack yet.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.220
And wire your wife.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.156
Let her know we'll be gone
for a few more weeks.

13:11.158 --> 13:14.559
What? What's going on?

13:14.561 --> 13:17.095
I want to go to Cuba.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.798
See this operation
you've built for us.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.367
(narrator)
Luciano realizes

13:22.369 --> 13:25.336
that Cuba is the missing piece
to what could be

13:25.338 --> 13:28.339
a billion dollar
drug operation in America.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.341
Now all he needs to do

13:30.343 --> 13:33.878
is sell the idea
to the rest of the Mafia.

13:37.349 --> 13:39.417
(seagull calling)

13:43.455 --> 13:45.523
(narrator)
After seven months in exile,

13:45.525 --> 13:48.827
Lucky Luciano
leaves Italy in secret...

13:50.830 --> 13:52.363
and heads to a country

13:52.365 --> 13:55.133
that's become a safe haven
for the mob...

13:56.535 --> 13:59.470
and is only 90 miles away
from America...

14:02.408 --> 14:04.475
Cuba.

14:07.847 --> 14:11.149
Meyer Lansky's association
with the Cuban government

14:11.151 --> 14:14.118
allows mobsters to operate
without interference,

14:14.120 --> 14:16.387
making it the perfect place

14:16.389 --> 14:19.290
for Luciano
to make his comeback.

14:24.563 --> 14:26.898
Luciano calls for a gathering

14:26.900 --> 14:29.567
that will bring the Five
Families to the island country

14:29.569 --> 14:31.936
to reaffirm his status

14:31.938 --> 14:36.074
and announce a plan
to expand the Mafia's power.

14:36.076 --> 14:39.544
It will become known
as the Havana Summit.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.415
(ship horn blows)
(jazz band playing)

14:44.417 --> 14:46.284
(Luciano)
You ladies enjoying
yourselves?

14:46.286 --> 14:48.586
(narrator)
For his long-awaited return,

14:48.588 --> 14:51.256
Luciano decides to go big

14:51.258 --> 14:54.893
and brings a well-known
performer in from New York City

14:54.895 --> 14:57.295
named Frank Sinatra.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.530
â™ª

15:01.500 --> 15:05.136
(Michael Green)
Why shouldn't a group
of wealthy entrepreneurs

15:05.138 --> 15:07.972
who are gathered for an event
hire an entertainer?

15:07.974 --> 15:10.174
It happens all the time.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.343
In this case, it happened to be
a bunch of gangsters

15:12.345 --> 15:14.479
bringing in the guy
we came to know

15:14.481 --> 15:16.547
as the "Chairman
of the Board".

15:18.183 --> 15:20.518
Sinatra did indeed
have friends in the Mafia.

15:20.520 --> 15:24.289
But if you're a singer,
who are you dealing with?

15:24.291 --> 15:26.524
I mean, who owns
the nightclubs?

15:26.526 --> 15:28.593
Mafia leaders.

15:30.362 --> 15:33.197
(Richard Hammer)
They had this big party.
You look very nice.

15:33.199 --> 15:36.067
Everybody came
and they brought money

15:36.069 --> 15:38.403
and they brought gifts
to Luciano.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.072
(indistinct chatter)

15:41.074 --> 15:44.175
Everybody was happy,
and they thought that Luciano

15:44.177 --> 15:46.611
would be on the next boat
back to the United States.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.486
(narrator)
With America's
top gangsters assembled,

15:55.488 --> 15:57.555
Luciano gets down to business.

15:59.391 --> 16:02.026
(Luciano)
I called this meeting
to personally tell you

16:02.028 --> 16:04.162
about our intentions
for the future.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.497
(narrator)
His first proposal
is to get the families

16:06.499 --> 16:10.268
to invest in Bugsy Siegel's
Las Vegas casino

16:10.270 --> 16:14.205
in an attempt to do
what Lansky has done for Cuba

16:14.207 --> 16:16.341
on American soil.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.676
Part two
of Luciano's plan

16:18.678 --> 16:22.613
is an even more ambitious
and lucrative proposal.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.350
(Luciano)
We're gonna be bringing a lot
more heroin into the country.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.419
From Italy to Cuba
to Florida...

16:28.421 --> 16:31.389
and then from
New York to Los Angeles.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.391
You guys are gonna have to
get your transportation,

16:33.393 --> 16:36.361
your storage and your
distribution in order.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.297
Because if we do
this thing right,

16:39.299 --> 16:41.399
we'll make 10 times more
than we did last year

16:41.401 --> 16:44.268
and then 10 times more
the year after that.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.704
And everybody
will get their cut.

16:46.706 --> 16:50.708
How about the guy who set
the whole thing up?

16:50.710 --> 16:53.244
What do you mean, Vito?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.313
You know what I'm talking about.
No, I don't.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.516
Where's my cut?

17:00.052 --> 17:03.087
Why don't we talk
about that after?

17:09.161 --> 17:11.029
(narrator)
While the assembled families

17:11.031 --> 17:13.731
agree to Luciano's proposals,

17:13.733 --> 17:16.801
Genovese feels he's being
cut out of the heroin racket

17:16.803 --> 17:18.603
he set up in Italy.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.671
â™ª

17:22.741 --> 17:25.109
Luciano's factories in Italy

17:25.111 --> 17:28.179
begin producing tens of
thousands of pounds of heroin,

17:28.181 --> 17:31.149
which is then smuggled
across the Atlantic

17:31.151 --> 17:35.353
through the Caribbean
and into the United States.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.488
Luciano was key
in setting up,

17:37.490 --> 17:41.159
uh, the importation
of heroin.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.327
He had set up

17:43.329 --> 17:46.197
the first pipeline

17:46.199 --> 17:48.599
for the heroin to come
into the United States.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.135
(narrator)
From his headquarters
in Havana,

17:51.137 --> 17:54.138
Lucky Luciano
is now in control

17:54.140 --> 17:56.574
of a global
narcotics empire.

17:59.778 --> 18:03.081
But there's still
even more money to be made.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.156
2,000 miles from Cuba

18:12.158 --> 18:14.559
in the middle of
the Nevada desert,

18:14.561 --> 18:17.462
Bugsy Siegel had
just broken ground

18:17.464 --> 18:20.198
on a luxury hotel
and casino.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.110
When you talk about
visionaries of Las Vegas,

18:32.112 --> 18:33.644
you gotta put
at the very top

18:33.646 --> 18:35.713
a fella like
Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.749
(narrator)
The Five Families have
invested millions of dollars

18:38.751 --> 18:41.853
in Siegel's vision
to turn Las Vegas

18:41.855 --> 18:44.822
into the gambling capital
of the country.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.325
Bugsy, we gotta
talk numbers.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.860
So in order to be
ready for opening,

18:48.862 --> 18:51.529
we need 300,000
for building material,

18:51.531 --> 18:53.364
500,000 for plumbing

18:53.366 --> 18:55.399
and 700,000 for labor?

18:55.401 --> 18:58.569
Yeah.
How is this possible?

18:58.571 --> 19:02.240
(narrator)
But the massive project is
already encountering problems.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.443
(Green)
Siegel wasn't necessarily
the best businessman.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.212
The Flamingo's costs

19:08.214 --> 19:11.282
were
spectacularly overrun.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.751
That's a million and a half
more I need to come up with.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.720
We're in the desert.
I got trucks coming, I got--

19:15.722 --> 19:18.523
Listen, hey,
keep the guys working.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.358
I'll get the money.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.460
Just build
the damn hotel.

19:22.462 --> 19:26.364
(narrator)
Siegel's operation has gone
wildly over budget,

19:26.366 --> 19:30.368
forcing him to borrow more money
from the Five Families.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.270
Now more than ever,

19:32.272 --> 19:34.805
he needs the Flamingo
to succeed.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.347
â™ª

19:46.785 --> 19:50.421
(narrator)
Lucky Luciano is running
his criminal empire from Cuba.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.456
And he's using
the island nation

19:52.458 --> 19:55.426
to smuggle heroin
into the United States.

19:55.428 --> 19:58.262
My pleasure, my pleasure,
enjoy yourselves.

19:58.264 --> 20:00.298
(chatter)

20:00.300 --> 20:02.633
There was so much money
in the drug trade

20:02.635 --> 20:06.737
that every family sooner
or later got into it.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.540
No one could
stay away from it.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.447
(narrator)
While the mob
is making a fortune

20:16.449 --> 20:18.783
on Luciano's drug ring...

20:20.519 --> 20:22.787
Vito Genovese believes

20:22.789 --> 20:24.956
he's the one
who deserves the respect

20:24.958 --> 20:27.692
and a larger cut
of the profit.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.763
(Hammer)
Luciano, he just did
not like Genovese.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.432
He hated him.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.601
Genovese was a powerful man,

20:36.603 --> 20:38.970
uh, but, uh,
they didn't get along.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.538
They never got along.

20:53.018 --> 20:55.253
(softly)
I like your--

20:55.255 --> 20:57.521
Did you forget about
our meeting, Charlie?

21:04.529 --> 21:06.864
No, I didn't forget
about our meeting.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.470
You're holding
me down, Charlie.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.538
And I want to know why.

21:14.540 --> 21:18.342
You want to know the truth?
Yeah.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.877
'Cause you're stupid.

21:21.413 --> 21:24.015
I done all right
for myself.

21:24.017 --> 21:26.417
Yeah.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.686
Because me and Meyer and Frank
have looked out for you

21:28.688 --> 21:31.722
all your life,
that's why.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.525
I earned my place
in this thing.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.661
And I deserve
some respect.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.896
You deserve what
I tell you you deserve.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.566
And you've earned nothing.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.505
Well, since we're
telling the truth...

21:49.508 --> 21:51.909
how's it feel to know you're
never going back to New York?

21:53.779 --> 21:55.813
Must hurt.

21:57.616 --> 22:00.351
It's gonna hurt even more
when the feds catch up with you.

22:03.088 --> 22:05.489
How would the feds
know where I am, Vito?

22:06.892 --> 22:09.026
Who's to say
they don't already know?

22:13.699 --> 22:15.666
Huh? What have you got?
(grunting)

22:17.436 --> 22:19.403
Come on.
(grunting continues)

22:23.608 --> 22:26.544
(coughing)

22:26.546 --> 22:28.779
(narrator)
For decades,
Luciano and Genovese

22:28.781 --> 22:30.881
have been loyal
business partners.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.718
But Luciano realizes
that from now on,

22:33.720 --> 22:36.987
Genovese can't be trusted.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.993
Meanwhile, 2,000 miles away

22:42.995 --> 22:45.062
in a Nevada desert,

22:45.064 --> 22:47.765
Bugsy Siegel's
luxury hotel and casino

22:47.767 --> 22:50.034
is finally complete.

22:51.636 --> 22:53.571
To build the Flamingo,

22:53.573 --> 22:56.607
Siegel's borrowed
the modern-day equivalent

22:56.609 --> 22:59.443
of $60 million
from the mob.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.648
(Cohen)
Bugsy saw his chance
in Las Vegas

23:04.650 --> 23:07.752
because he'd invested everything
in this sort of dream

23:07.754 --> 23:10.855
of building a legitimate
gambling empire

23:10.857 --> 23:14.158
just like Steve Wynn
or anybody else.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.162
(narrator)
Bugsy Siegel knows the Flamingo
has to be a huge success.

23:24.703 --> 23:28.706
But on opening night,
a huge storm hits Las Vegas.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.776
And with many of
the hotel rooms unfinished,

23:31.778 --> 23:35.579
Bugsy Siegel's big opening
is a bust.

23:41.820 --> 23:44.455
Bugsy Siegel,
he had this great vision

23:44.457 --> 23:47.992
of having this luxury resort
in the middle of the desert

23:47.994 --> 23:51.896
that would attract people,
that would become something big.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.632
But the night
the Flamingo opened,

23:54.634 --> 23:57.034
December 26th, 1946,

23:57.036 --> 23:59.036
the hotel
wasn't ready.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.972
And the costs

24:01.974 --> 24:05.609
were spectacularly
overrun.

24:07.579 --> 24:10.080
Virginia,
get me a drink.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.149
Sure.

24:21.660 --> 24:24.195
Chin up, huh?
We'll be all right.

24:24.197 --> 24:26.764
It's this weather
slowing everyone down.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.833
Yeah.
It'll be all right, baby.

24:32.237 --> 24:34.738
Here's to you,
doll.

24:36.007 --> 24:38.008
(narrator)
In the first week it's open,

24:38.010 --> 24:40.911
the Flamingo loses
the modern-day equivalent

24:40.913 --> 24:44.014
of $3.6 million

24:44.016 --> 24:47.184
and Siegel is forced
to shut down.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.887
His Las Vegas dream

24:49.889 --> 24:51.956
has turned
into a nightmare.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.264
â™ª

25:02.701 --> 25:04.535
(narrator)
In 1947,

25:04.537 --> 25:06.604
just two weeks after
its opening night,

25:06.606 --> 25:09.507
Bugsy Siegel's
Las Vegas hotel

25:09.509 --> 25:11.876
has been forced to close.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.211
And his boss
and business partner,

25:14.213 --> 25:17.214
Lucky Luciano,
wants answers.

25:25.590 --> 25:28.125
(Luciano)
Meyer, this isn't good.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.060
There's a lot of money
unaccounted for.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.796
I really think this thing
can make money.

25:32.798 --> 25:34.698
He just needs
a little more time.

25:37.636 --> 25:39.570
Meyer, I love you
like a brother.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.906
And I love Ben
like a brother.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.141
But time is
running out on him.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.977
You know it,
he knows it.

25:46.979 --> 25:50.581
(narrator)
Meyer Lansky manages to
buy more time for Bugsy Siegel

25:50.583 --> 25:53.217
to make the Flamingo
a success.

25:55.086 --> 25:58.088
And Siegel knows
that this time,

25:58.090 --> 26:00.558
he has to pull it off.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.961
He finally completes the
construction of the guest rooms.

26:03.963 --> 26:07.765
He pays publicists
to hype the event...

26:07.767 --> 26:10.100
(excited chatter)

26:10.102 --> 26:12.102
...and calls in favors

26:12.104 --> 26:14.638
from all of his
celebrity friends.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.640
(excited chatter continues)

26:16.642 --> 26:18.676
(Cohen)
Bugsy was kind of like
the Italian gangster

26:18.678 --> 26:20.277
of Jewish gangsters.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.280
He was flash, he was out in
public, he was dating starlets.

26:23.282 --> 26:27.051
And sort of like his full-time
gig was being Bugsy Siegel.

26:29.788 --> 26:32.122
â™ª

26:32.124 --> 26:34.191
(chatter)

26:38.330 --> 26:40.598
(narrator)
On a clear Las Vegas night,

26:40.600 --> 26:43.133
three months after
closing its doors,

26:43.135 --> 26:46.770
The Flamingo was ready
for its second grand opening.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.144
And gamblers from
all over the country

26:54.146 --> 26:56.313
show up to spend
their money.

26:56.315 --> 26:59.283
(indistinct chatter)

27:00.919 --> 27:02.820
Bugsy Siegel's Flamingo Hotel

27:02.822 --> 27:04.388
was really the first
of its kind.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.824
It had its great restaurants,

27:06.826 --> 27:08.258
it had
its terrific bars,

27:08.260 --> 27:11.261
swimming pools,
gorgeous women.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.831
I mean,
it was a precursor

27:13.833 --> 27:15.833
of what Las Vegas
is today.

27:15.835 --> 27:18.369
Welcome to the Flamingo.
Enjoy yourself.

27:18.371 --> 27:21.005
How are you tonight?
Good, how are you?
You look beautiful.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.407
Oh, thank you.
(slot machine clinking)

27:23.409 --> 27:26.710
(narrator)
After more than a year of
delays and budget overages...

27:29.848 --> 27:33.717
Bugsy Siegel's big gamble
on a forgotten desert town

27:33.719 --> 27:36.420
finally pays off.

27:45.930 --> 27:49.400
While Bugsy Siegel
is riding high,

27:49.402 --> 27:51.802
Vito Genovese
is convinced

27:51.804 --> 27:54.371
it's time he gets
a bigger cut of the profits

27:54.373 --> 27:56.373
for laying the groundwork

27:56.375 --> 27:59.443
for Luciano's
Italian heroin racket.

28:00.945 --> 28:03.047
I just can't get it
out of my head.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.149
Try.
I'm trying.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.851
Well, then try harder.

28:15.393 --> 28:18.962
They had nothing before me...
nothing!

28:18.964 --> 28:21.899
Now what are
they clearing?

28:21.901 --> 28:24.301
A couple million dollars.

28:24.303 --> 28:27.738
Every week.
Each and every week.

28:28.773 --> 28:30.841
That's my money.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.817
You should take it back.

28:39.819 --> 28:43.253
Baby, it's not
that complicated.

28:52.864 --> 28:55.165
(narrator)
As Vito Genovese
looks for a way

28:55.167 --> 28:58.168
to be the boss once again,

28:58.170 --> 29:00.304
the U.S. government

29:00.306 --> 29:03.273
eliminates one of his
greatest obstacles.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.176
The Federal Bureau
of Narcotics

29:06.178 --> 29:09.279
has had Lucky Luciano
under surveillance in Cuba.

29:09.281 --> 29:12.449
And soon learns of
his drug ring

29:12.451 --> 29:15.018
importing heroin
into the United States

29:15.020 --> 29:17.187
on a massive scale.

29:24.162 --> 29:27.464
The United States decided that
they didn't want Luciano here.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.267
And they put pressure
on the Cuban government...

29:32.370 --> 29:34.905
and made the Cuban government

29:34.907 --> 29:36.774
send him back
to Italy,

29:36.776 --> 29:40.410
which was the last thing
he wanted to do at that point.

29:43.548 --> 29:45.482
(narrator)
In March of 1947,

29:45.484 --> 29:48.152
Luciano is forced
to board a ship

29:48.154 --> 29:50.220
bound for Italy.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.124
â™ª

29:55.994 --> 29:58.195
Destroying his dreams

29:58.197 --> 30:01.131
of returning
to America.

30:09.073 --> 30:12.342
(narrator)
After being deported
to Italy again,

30:12.344 --> 30:14.912
Lucky Luciano's control
of his empire

30:14.914 --> 30:17.414
has continued to crumble.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.583
And he's made
a dangerous new enemy

30:19.585 --> 30:21.919
out of Vito Genovese.

30:24.022 --> 30:28.192
While Bugsy Siegel's casino
is finally turning a profit,

30:28.194 --> 30:30.527
none of the mob bosses
who invested

30:30.529 --> 30:34.198
are getting their cut.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.034
Well, how fast do we get
to making that up?
I don't know.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.236
This is an investment,
there's a certain way
it should be run.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.371
It should be here.
$6 million.

30:41.373 --> 30:42.940
He's gotten
very soft, Bugsy.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.075
Listen, I trust Bugsy,
I grew up with him.

30:45.077 --> 30:48.145
Yeah, but he has a soft spot,
you know, and he can't see.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.113
He likes
the broads too much.
That's what I'm talking about.

30:50.115 --> 30:51.849
Exactly.
He's become Mr. Hollywood.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.383
But all this exposure's
not needed.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.118
(narrator)
In New York,

30:55.120 --> 30:57.120
the other families are
beginning to lose patience

30:57.122 --> 30:59.289
with Bugsy Siegel.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.625
There were stories that
Virginia Hill stole money.

31:01.627 --> 31:04.394
There were stories
that Bugsy Siegel stole money.

31:04.396 --> 31:07.564
And the investors are
not happy with all that.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.968
And, eventually,
mobsters get together

31:10.970 --> 31:14.471
and are debating what are
we going to do about this?

31:17.475 --> 31:19.176
(car horn honking)

31:20.245 --> 31:22.312
(clock ticking
slowly)

31:31.189 --> 31:33.156
(door opens)

31:33.158 --> 31:35.893
What happened?

31:39.163 --> 31:41.265
Virginia Hill
is what happened.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.600
One of our guys at the airport
just spotted Miss Hill

31:43.602 --> 31:46.003
on a flight to Switzerland
with a ton of luggage.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.442
The Flamingo
is packed every night.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.578
They're turning people away
at the door.

31:56.648 --> 31:59.683
Where the hell
is the money?

32:01.185 --> 32:02.653
I'll tell you
where it is.

32:02.655 --> 32:06.089
It's on a damn plane to
Switzerland with Virginia Hill.

32:11.629 --> 32:14.631
It's gotta be done,
Meyer.

32:14.633 --> 32:18.535
(sighs)
Lucky and I don't like it
any more than you do.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.676
Frank...

32:25.678 --> 32:28.011
Let me talk to him.

32:56.007 --> 32:58.075
â™ª

33:06.684 --> 33:11.688
<i>â™ª Jesus, I am coming</i>
<i>home today â™ª</i>

33:11.690 --> 33:14.358
<i>â™ª For I have found </i>

33:14.360 --> 33:17.728
<i>â™ª There's joy in Thee alone </i>

33:17.730 --> 33:20.464
<i>â™ª From the path of sin </i>

33:20.466 --> 33:23.300
<i>â™ª I turn away </i>

33:23.302 --> 33:28.305
<i>â™ª Now I am coming home </i>

33:28.307 --> 33:34.444
<i>â™ª Jesus, I am coming</i>
<i>home today â™ª</i>

33:34.446 --> 33:40.384
<i>â™ª Never, never more</i>
<i>from Thee to stray â™ª</i>
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

33:40.386 --> 33:45.389
<i>â™ª Lord I now accept</i>
<i>Thy precious promise â™ª</i>

33:45.391 --> 33:47.524
(gunshots)

33:51.596 --> 33:54.064
(gunshots continue,
glass shattering)

34:03.441 --> 34:07.477
(phone ringing)

34:15.753 --> 34:17.821
(ringing continues)

34:34.138 --> 34:36.239
(Bugsy)
To the Lower East Side Gang.

34:37.508 --> 34:39.209
<i>Salud.</i>

34:43.714 --> 34:47.184
You came all this way
to see me go?

34:47.186 --> 34:49.352
Had to say good-bye.

34:55.326 --> 34:57.360
(Polisi)
In the life,

34:57.362 --> 34:59.463
you justify your actions

34:59.465 --> 35:02.365
and you figure a way out
to make yourself believe

35:02.367 --> 35:05.402
that it's okay
to do illegal things,

35:05.404 --> 35:08.205
immoral things,
commit acts of violence.

35:11.309 --> 35:13.276
You can't have any regrets.

35:16.247 --> 35:19.549
(narrator)
On June 20th, 1947,

35:19.551 --> 35:23.854
Bugsy Siegel is shot
nine times in Beverly Hills.

35:23.856 --> 35:26.189
Siegel becomes

35:26.191 --> 35:28.325
the first of Luciano's
original crew

35:28.327 --> 35:30.393
to be killed.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.165
The death of
Bugsy Siegel still--

35:35.167 --> 35:36.500
it's like the death
of John F. Kennedy.

35:36.502 --> 35:37.868
It's a big mystery.

35:37.870 --> 35:40.504
He lost a lot of
the mob's money.

35:40.506 --> 35:43.540
And he had done something
that people got killed for

35:43.542 --> 35:45.275
doing with the mob.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.511
And the people most often
killed by the mob

35:47.513 --> 35:50.514
are other mobsters, so it
seems to fit that pattern.

35:52.783 --> 35:55.152
(Green)
Exactly what was decided

35:55.154 --> 35:57.287
is not entirely known.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.523
As for who did it,
there have been stories

35:59.525 --> 36:01.691
that it was this hit man
or that hit man.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.527
That it was because
of the skimming,

36:03.529 --> 36:05.929
that it was due to the Flamingo
not making profits.

36:05.931 --> 36:09.199
There's even a theory that
because he and Virginia Hill

36:09.201 --> 36:11.735
had a very difficult
relationship,

36:11.737 --> 36:13.937
that her brother
was avenging that,

36:13.939 --> 36:16.306
and it had nothing to do
with the mob.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.874
What happened?

36:17.876 --> 36:19.876
Well, according to the Beverly
Hills Police Department,

36:19.878 --> 36:22.179
it is still an open case.

36:23.548 --> 36:26.316
(narrator)
20 minutes after his murder,

36:26.318 --> 36:28.718
Meyer Lansky's men

36:28.720 --> 36:31.621
take control of
the Flamingo.

36:36.761 --> 36:38.795
â™ª

36:39.931 --> 36:42.832
(narrator)
In 1947, Bugsy Siegel,

36:42.834 --> 36:45.569
one of Lucky Luciano's
oldest friends

36:45.571 --> 36:48.972
and business partners,
has been murdered.

36:50.908 --> 36:53.510
And while the mob has moved
quickly to take over

36:53.512 --> 36:55.312
Siegel's hotel in Las Vegas

36:55.314 --> 36:57.881
and Luciano's authority
has been restored...

36:59.717 --> 37:02.419
another member of
Luciano's operation

37:02.421 --> 37:05.989
begins organizing
his own fight for control.

37:09.493 --> 37:12.662
Frustrated by his lack of
power within the Mafia...

37:14.265 --> 37:18.001
Vito Genovese
wants to be boss again

37:18.003 --> 37:22.239
and begins to look outside
the Luciano family for help.

37:25.343 --> 37:27.544
He reaches out
to a mid-level gangster

37:27.546 --> 37:29.613
in one of the other
New York families.

37:29.615 --> 37:32.382
A 46-year-old
Sicilian underboss

37:32.384 --> 37:34.784
in the Mangano family

37:34.786 --> 37:37.320
named
Carlo Gambino.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.258
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind?

37:41.260 --> 37:44.027
(sighs)

37:47.265 --> 37:50.267
I don't know how much more of
this crap I can take, Carlo.

37:50.269 --> 37:52.302
Oh, you know Lucky.

37:52.304 --> 37:55.038
The man holds
a grudge.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.908
You think I plan on taking
orders from the Manganos

37:58.910 --> 38:01.544
and Anastasia
the rest of my life?

38:01.546 --> 38:04.848
So what are you waiting for?
The right opportunity.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.916
As should you.

38:08.719 --> 38:10.887
Just stay
in the game.

38:20.831 --> 38:23.633
(narrator)
Genovese sees an ally
in Gambino.

38:26.637 --> 38:28.838
A like-minded mobster
with ambitions

38:28.840 --> 38:31.374
of climbing the ranks
of the New York Mafia.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.745
Carlo Gambino was old school,

38:35.747 --> 38:38.381
quiet, reticent,

38:38.383 --> 38:41.951
secretive,
very secretive.

38:48.025 --> 38:49.926
(narrator)
While Genovese and Gambino

38:49.928 --> 38:52.962
wait for their chance
to make a move,

38:52.964 --> 38:56.900
a new challenge rises
for the New York underworld.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.703
In May of 1950,

38:59.705 --> 39:03.707
an ambitious U.S. senator
named Estes Kefauver

39:03.709 --> 39:07.610
forms a committee
to investigate the Mafia,

39:07.612 --> 39:09.779
including New York's
most notorious mobsters.

39:11.415 --> 39:14.417
It's the largest effort
to expose organized crime

39:14.419 --> 39:16.052
in U.S. history

39:16.054 --> 39:19.723
in what will come to be known
as the Kefauver Hearings.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.825
A Senate investigating
committee

39:21.827 --> 39:24.894
held a series of hearings
to get at organized crime.

39:24.896 --> 39:27.564
In addition, they made
the very smart decision

39:27.566 --> 39:29.899
to televise
some of the hearings.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.635
(narrator)
In front of a television
audience of 30 million,

39:32.637 --> 39:34.904
the Mafia takes the stand.

39:34.906 --> 39:37.674
I decline to answer
on the grounds

39:37.676 --> 39:39.442
that it may incriminate me.

39:39.444 --> 39:41.678
I refuse to answer

39:41.680 --> 39:45.081
on the grounds that it may
tend to incriminate me.

39:45.083 --> 39:47.016
(Goodman)
The witnesses are very cool.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.919
They just take the Fifth,
which the Constitution provides,

39:49.921 --> 39:52.722
and say they're not going to
tend to incriminate them.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.496
(narrator)
As the hearings drag on,

39:59.498 --> 40:01.531
acting boss Frank Costello

40:01.533 --> 40:04.434
begins to see his name
mentioned in the press,

40:04.436 --> 40:07.670
often linked to horrific
murders and crimes.

40:10.007 --> 40:12.675
When he's finally
called to testify,

40:12.677 --> 40:16.012
Costello decides to take
a different approach.

40:19.550 --> 40:22.619
Frank, you have to
listen to me.
I'm listening.

40:22.621 --> 40:25.622
You gotta take the Fifth.
That's what makes you
look guilty.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.024
Moses, will you
talk to him?

40:28.026 --> 40:30.960
Frank,
the more you talk,

40:30.962 --> 40:33.029
the more trouble
you're gonna get into.

40:33.031 --> 40:35.965
I can talk
to these men.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.568
(Talese)
Frank Costello
was rather unique.

40:38.570 --> 40:41.805
He had hope,
aspiration and drive

40:41.807 --> 40:44.174
to be perceived

40:44.176 --> 40:46.543
as a somewhat
legitimate person.

40:46.545 --> 40:49.078
And he thought he was part
of American capitalism.

40:50.881 --> 40:54.083
What have you ever done for
your country as a U.S. citizen?

40:57.221 --> 40:58.988
(clearing throat)
Paid my tax.

40:58.990 --> 41:02.592
(crowd murmuring)

41:02.594 --> 41:05.161
(Raab)
Frank Costello
went before TV cameras

41:05.163 --> 41:06.830
when there was
an investigation

41:06.832 --> 41:09.165
into organized crime
in America.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.867
He thought he could outwit

41:10.869 --> 41:14.003
some lowly
prosecutor or lawyer.

41:14.005 --> 41:17.474
Do you want to
qualify your answer?

41:17.476 --> 41:19.576
Yes, I'd like
to qualify it.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.778
How so?

41:21.780 --> 41:23.913
I want what I said,

41:23.915 --> 41:25.715
specifically
what I said,

41:25.717 --> 41:28.117
on the official record.

41:28.119 --> 41:30.186
(Green)
Costello made a mistake

41:30.188 --> 41:32.689
in thinking
that he could handle

41:32.691 --> 41:34.791
a Senate
investigating committee

41:34.793 --> 41:37.527
the way he handled
local politicians.

41:37.529 --> 41:39.863
They're different
breeds of cat.

41:39.865 --> 41:42.232
(Senator)
<i>It contradicts</i>

41:42.234 --> 41:45.635
<i>your earlier testimony.</i>

41:45.637 --> 41:48.204
(Costello)
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

41:48.206 --> 41:50.273
(Senator)
<i>Would you like me</i>
<i>to refresh your memory?</i>

41:50.275 --> 41:52.976
(Costello)
<i>Ahem, you don't need</i>
<i>to refresh my memory.</i>

41:52.978 --> 41:54.777
<i>My memory's fine.</i>

41:54.779 --> 41:56.579
(Senator)
<i>I'd be happy to read back</i>

41:56.581 --> 41:58.648
<i>your earlier testimony.</i>

41:58.650 --> 42:01.050
(Costello)
<i>I can refresh</i>
<i>my own memory, thank you.</i>

42:01.052 --> 42:04.220
Guy lost his mind.

42:04.222 --> 42:06.256
(narrator)
With the hearings revealing

42:06.258 --> 42:09.225
a weakness in
Costello's leadership,

42:09.227 --> 42:12.061
Vito Genovese
knows his opportunity

42:12.063 --> 42:15.298
has finally come.

42:15.300 --> 42:18.101
And with Carlo Gambino
on his side,

42:18.103 --> 42:21.604
Genovese is ready
to strike back

42:21.606 --> 42:23.606
at Lucky Luciano

42:23.608 --> 42:26.676
by taking down
Frank Costello.

42:32.783 --> 42:34.851
