WEBVTT

02:04.958 --> 02:05.792
Perfect.

02:07.836 --> 02:08.837
Your Majesty.

02:09.587 --> 02:11.965
Your Majesty!

02:12.257 --> 02:14.884
Your Majesty!

02:14.968 --> 02:16.302
Your Majesty.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.557
Your Majesty. Please just kill me!

02:20.849 --> 02:22.267
My gosh!

02:23.601 --> 02:26.688
Your Majesty!

02:26.771 --> 02:29.649
Your Majesty! Great!

02:30.942 --> 02:32.485
Entering the Royal Palace.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.068
Excuse me.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.074
Excuse me.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.540
Why are you blocking the door?

03:30.418 --> 03:34.297
Let me introduce myself.
I was assigned to the Yemungwan.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.925
I'm the chronicle keeper, Yoon Yi-seo.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.426
The newbie.

03:38.509 --> 03:39.344
Yes.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.305
Your responsibility is crucial.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.683
I'll devote my life to serve the Majesty.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.937
A royal chronicle keeper
shouldn't say that.

03:49.854 --> 03:53.024
You must record everything
the King does and says.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.609
It's a critical duty!

03:54.692 --> 03:58.071
Are you going to ignore
fairness and objectivity?

03:59.405 --> 04:02.283
How could you guide the king this way?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.035
Listen, you two.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.705
Don't scare him on his first day.

04:09.165 --> 04:12.460
Welcome! You're educated
and from a good family.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.754
You're healthy and you look...

04:21.552 --> 04:23.638
A chronicle keeper must look good.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.518
What you just said… Were you sincere?

04:30.228 --> 04:33.606
For a moment, I forgot about
the chronicle keeper's duty.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.108
-I'm satisfied.
-Pardon?

04:35.775 --> 04:37.193
-Let's go!
-Yes.

04:37.443 --> 04:38.278
Where to?

04:40.780 --> 04:41.614
Your Majesty.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.242
The new chronicle keeper,

04:44.617 --> 04:47.120
Yoon Yi-seo, is here to greet you.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.473
Damn it.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.274
Your Majesty!

05:16.649 --> 05:18.234
-Your--
-That's enough.

05:23.614 --> 05:24.615
Come closer.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.043
-Hand.
-Pardon me?

05:35.960 --> 05:37.045
Give me your hand.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.051
You have chubby hands.

05:43.926 --> 05:44.761
Other side.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.057
You're not a typical scholar.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.518
-Close your eyes.
-Pardon?

05:52.852 --> 05:53.936
Your eyes!

05:55.146 --> 05:58.941
I've heard that you have
a brilliant talent.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.736
You never forget what you see and hear.

06:02.028 --> 06:06.199
-Thank you, Your Majesty--
-Enough!

06:08.076 --> 06:11.037
Who taught you to talk like an old man?

06:13.706 --> 06:15.458
-Did you teach him?
-No!

06:16.459 --> 06:18.503
-Why would he say that--
-Eyes!

06:22.757 --> 06:25.760
-Saw the Dragon with Cloud on the ceiling?
-Pardon?

06:29.972 --> 06:31.057
Yes, I saw it.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.226
-How many magical beads?
-Pardon?

06:33.309 --> 06:34.894
How many magical beads?

06:36.354 --> 06:38.314
Two... There are two beads.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.737
-How many toes did you see?
-Pardon me?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.323
Toes!

06:48.241 --> 06:50.660
Do you always make people ask you twice?

06:51.119 --> 06:51.953
No.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.621
How many toes?

06:58.584 --> 07:00.169
Five on each foot.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.255
There are four legs.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.091
There are 40 toes.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.469
Fine.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.097
Now...

07:12.390 --> 07:15.601
how many scales are on the dragon's tail?

07:35.496 --> 07:38.082
How many scales are on the dragon's tail?

07:43.796 --> 07:46.924
I'm not sure where exactly
the dragon's tail starts.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.011
When compared to the other part,

07:51.387 --> 07:52.346
there are eight.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.565
What's his name?

08:02.857 --> 08:04.317
Yoon Yi-seo, Majesty.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.735
Yoon Yi-seo.

08:06.986 --> 08:07.820
Obo!

08:08.779 --> 08:10.281
Let's call him Obo.

08:10.781 --> 08:11.699
Yes, Majesty.

08:13.659 --> 08:14.494
Good work.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.038
-Obo!
-Pardon?

08:58.162 --> 08:58.996
Your Majesty.

09:04.919 --> 09:08.631
Relay any information regarding
the King to me from now on.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.174
You've heard, right?

09:10.633 --> 09:13.261
Our King is arrogant and incompetent.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.347
We have several allies
in the Royal Palace.

09:16.722 --> 09:20.393
It's not hard. You just have to tell us
what you see and hear.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.145
On three, give me your answer.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.022
One.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.316
Two.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.236
Who do you think
you're threatening, asshole?

09:30.987 --> 09:34.365
Do you think I became a chronicle keeper
to kiss your ass?

09:34.949 --> 09:35.908
This is absurd.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.035
What you're asking is ridiculous!

09:39.495 --> 09:40.454
Son of a bitch.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.790
You curse more than I expected.

09:46.877 --> 09:47.712
Your Majesty.

09:49.005 --> 09:49.839
Sir.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.302
Do you know your basic duty?

09:55.970 --> 09:56.887
Five steps.

09:58.514 --> 10:01.017
Never be more than five steps
away from me.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.893
Yes, Your Majesty.

10:16.115 --> 10:16.991
"Dokwang."

10:20.786 --> 10:23.873
The scarecrow appeared
outside the four main gates.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.501
It resembles the King.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.421
What does that sign say?

10:31.339 --> 10:33.841
-Move aside!
-Hurry up, move aside!

10:37.219 --> 10:38.971
Hurry, move aside!

10:39.680 --> 10:40.681
Bring it to me.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.313
Move aside!

10:53.861 --> 10:55.321
Take me...

10:57.198 --> 11:00.159
-Take me to His Majesty.
-Are you all right?

11:03.037 --> 11:03.954
Please...

11:04.163 --> 11:06.374
Please take me to His Majesty.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.459
Please take me to...

11:39.907 --> 11:40.866
Your Majesty.

11:46.497 --> 11:49.291
He was the Dokwang in Hamgil.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.770
-When was he found?
-At about 4 p.m. today.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.816
-Cause of death?
-We must do an autopsy to confirm.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.069
Do the autopsy immediately.

12:58.402 --> 12:59.236
I'm sorry.

13:31.685 --> 13:32.728
White phosphorus.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.481
Its ignition point is low,

13:35.564 --> 13:37.942
so it will ignite with just a spark.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.987
If you don't know,
it looks like he self-ignited.

13:42.863 --> 13:46.075
White phosphorus also cause paralysis.

13:46.784 --> 13:50.663
That's why he didn't writhe
even when his head caught on fire.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.206
Clearly,

13:52.832 --> 13:56.377
someone near him sparked the fire.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.004
But...

14:00.381 --> 14:03.008
they could've killed him earlier...

14:03.884 --> 14:06.095
so, why kill him in a public place?

14:18.691 --> 14:19.650
Second page.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.904
Read the report.

14:25.614 --> 14:26.699
Yes, Your Majesty.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.420
The report says the incident occurred
on market day.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.755
Hundreds of people on the street.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.175
Market day... Hundreds of people...

14:46.010 --> 14:47.219
Where in the market?

14:47.636 --> 14:49.471
It says it was near the tavern.

14:50.055 --> 14:54.059
To the right of the tavern,
there are vegetable and dried fish shops.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.686
-Across--
-An open space.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.938
Mainly for peddlers.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.691
-Who was there today?
-Today...

15:01.567 --> 15:03.402
there was a scarecrow.

15:03.861 --> 15:04.695
A scarecrow?

15:05.779 --> 15:08.616
People gathered to see
what was written on it.

15:08.699 --> 15:09.533
What was it?

15:12.411 --> 15:13.329
Your Majesty...

15:14.663 --> 15:16.040
it's too profane.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.125
You're making me ask you twice.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.044
What was written?

15:24.048 --> 15:24.924
"Hell fire...

15:27.009 --> 15:29.178
will burn many heads.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.557
A fire from the Hades
will burn the Han River.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.186
And the King's wrath
will burn down the country.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.648
As the light fades and joy fills in,

15:41.523 --> 15:43.400
the world of Maitreya is far."

15:44.068 --> 15:45.611
Majesty, my apologies.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.781
"As the light fades and joy fills in."
Do you see it?

15:48.864 --> 15:52.034
-It's a meaningless rumor--
-I am "Light of the Sun."

15:52.618 --> 15:53.494
And Joy...

15:54.495 --> 15:56.956
My nephew's name is Joy.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.751
It means Prince Jaseong will take
my throne.

16:00.834 --> 16:01.669
This is not...

16:03.253 --> 16:04.797
a mere meaningless rumor.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.468
-Follow me, Obo.
-Yes, Majesty.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.565
According to the investigation,
for the last two weeks,

17:05.190 --> 17:08.569
scarecrows were found
in all eight provinces of Joseon.

17:09.403 --> 17:13.657
And the same thing was written
on all the scarecrows.

17:14.908 --> 17:15.784
Other details?

17:15.951 --> 17:17.494
One thing we've noticed is

17:17.578 --> 17:21.123
that the scarecrows were dispersed
around Hamgil.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.297
I'm not sure who set up such a plan,
but it's clever.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.345
Hamgil province...

17:38.891 --> 17:40.976
Bring Nam Gun-hee, their envoy.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.897
-Majesty, an investigation--
-Two Dokwang members were killed.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.026
Are we just going to stay defenseless?

17:54.198 --> 17:55.157
Brother.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.909
Brother.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.118
My brother.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.582
There will be no more bloodshed
in the Palace.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.797
I'm going to be...

18:11.006 --> 18:14.426
fully responsible for our father's sins.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.262
Brother!

18:17.721 --> 18:18.680
Brother!

18:19.348 --> 18:21.016
My little brother...

18:21.308 --> 18:23.894
You don't have to worry about anything.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.438
Brother, please stay strong!

18:26.855 --> 18:27.731
Please...

18:28.899 --> 18:30.359
look after my son.

18:31.401 --> 18:35.572
-My Prince Jaseong.
-Brother!

18:36.657 --> 18:38.408
Brother!

18:47.167 --> 18:48.001
Brother,

18:49.962 --> 18:52.548
there won't be more bloodshed
in the Palace.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.967
I will make sure of it.

19:00.597 --> 19:01.640
It feels great

19:01.723 --> 19:05.144
to have the four of us together like this.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.480
Right, son-in-law?

19:12.818 --> 19:13.652
By the way,

19:14.987 --> 19:17.322
you look like you have concerns.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.868
Is there something that I'm not aware of?

19:23.745 --> 19:24.580
Excellency,

19:25.914 --> 19:26.999
the King's called…

19:28.041 --> 19:29.209
for me.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.587
Why?

19:31.712 --> 19:35.174
The King has been sending
his subordinates...

19:35.924 --> 19:37.467
to Hamgil.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.553
To Hamgil province?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.388
What about our mine?

19:42.306 --> 19:43.891
It's currently closed.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.898
Why is it so difficult to control him?

19:51.648 --> 19:55.027
He has no clue
who should be running this country.

19:55.152 --> 19:55.986
Excellency,

19:57.696 --> 19:58.947
it's time to act.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.491
Treason against the King?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.285
We have no choice.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.830
We must act before the King finds out

20:07.289 --> 20:08.832
about the iron ore.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.794
If the iron ore is taken,
how will we make money?

20:13.378 --> 20:14.838
What are you thinking?

20:15.589 --> 20:17.841
For someone with way too many duties,

20:18.300 --> 20:19.259
the throne is...

20:22.012 --> 20:22.846
just a burden.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.477
He doesn't have to sit on the throne

20:30.437 --> 20:32.940
to run this country.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.652
By any chance...

20:37.236 --> 20:41.365
do the strange rumors going around
have anything to do with you?

20:43.492 --> 20:45.202
I'll let you know later.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.329
I'm leaving now.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.872
Okay.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.176
I guess you heard.

21:21.655 --> 21:25.200
Majesty, the Hamgil envoy is here.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.161
General!

21:31.248 --> 21:32.082
Welcome.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.631
How does it feel to be here after so long?

21:41.258 --> 21:43.969
How have you been, my brother?

21:44.928 --> 21:46.638
Thanks for asking, Majesty.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.975
You don't have to call me brother.

21:51.768 --> 21:52.811
Indeed.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.231
Like my teacher said, you're very humble.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.317
I'm flattered, Majesty.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.112
Right.

22:02.529 --> 22:06.908
Have you heard anything about me recently?

22:07.617 --> 22:09.619
I haven't heard anything.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.873
Like I'm the best swordsman in Joseon.

22:22.090 --> 22:25.427
You always held your tongue.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.596
Anyway...

22:29.473 --> 22:31.099
How is Hamgil province?

22:32.184 --> 22:35.312
Invasions by Northern barbarians
have decreased.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.233
You're doing great, as expected.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.903
I am honored, Majesty.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.489
I still have a lot of work to do.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.199
Speaking of which,

22:47.699 --> 22:49.618
I have a favor to ask you.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.996
The atmosphere in the capital isn't good.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.500
As of today,
you're the Vice Minister of War.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.086
Please stand by my side.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.882
-Your Majesty...
-What?

23:05.425 --> 23:06.676
Is there a problem?

23:11.264 --> 23:12.891
Thank you, Your Majesty.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.727
I'm ready to sacrifice my post.

23:20.023 --> 23:22.317
He's a sly old fox, indeed.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.861
If I wasn't the King,

23:24.945 --> 23:27.322
I'd love to compete with him to find out

23:27.406 --> 23:29.491
who's the best swordsman in Joseon.

23:30.617 --> 23:31.535
Oh, well.

23:32.285 --> 23:34.413
You'll have to be my opponent.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.164
Follow me, Obo.

23:41.128 --> 23:41.962
There you go.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.554
Get in position.

23:52.597 --> 23:55.434
How can I dare
to point a sword at Your Majesty?

23:55.517 --> 23:57.727
This is a wooden sword.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.563
I can't obey you, Majesty.

24:00.564 --> 24:03.442
-Please, withdraw your order!
-You can't obey me?

24:05.068 --> 24:05.902
No, Majesty.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.029
Are you sure?

24:10.157 --> 24:11.116
A royal command?

24:12.534 --> 24:14.119
Please withdraw it!

24:20.834 --> 24:22.252
It's a royal command.

24:22.752 --> 24:23.753
Get in position.

24:24.963 --> 24:25.964
I can't dare...

24:27.549 --> 24:28.508
Get in position.

24:29.885 --> 24:30.886
I really can't...

24:36.683 --> 24:39.811
-You said it's a royal command, right?
-Yes, I did.

24:40.770 --> 24:41.688
In that case,

24:42.063 --> 24:44.316
since you are determined,

24:44.566 --> 24:47.569
I'll obey your royal command.

24:47.694 --> 24:49.654
You should've said that sooner.

24:53.658 --> 24:54.493
Okay!

24:55.327 --> 24:56.453
Get in position.

25:12.552 --> 25:13.553
Not bad!

25:23.730 --> 25:24.564
Excellency.

25:24.856 --> 25:27.567
Chronicle keeper Yoon.
What are you doing here?

25:32.906 --> 25:35.200
Thank you for all you've done for me.

25:36.326 --> 25:40.330
I know I wasn't qualified, but thanks
for supporting and helping me.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.166
I'll never forget your kindness.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.085
This duty...

25:46.086 --> 25:48.004
I had no idea this dokwang duty

25:48.213 --> 25:51.508
involved such a heavy responsibility.

25:51.925 --> 25:54.261
I'm not qualified.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.265
Before I entered the Palace,

25:58.932 --> 26:01.476
-my father--
-He's very ill, isn't he?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.938
I saw him last night,

26:05.814 --> 26:06.898
he seems healthy.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.485
But, you see...

26:17.450 --> 26:18.994
What exactly is dokwang?

26:19.411 --> 26:22.122
Why do I have to be involved
in secret affairs?

26:22.330 --> 26:24.249
It looks very dangerous.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.253
That's a chronicle keeper's job.
What can I do?

26:28.795 --> 26:30.797
Keeper by day, dokwang by night.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.384
-It's the King's secret organization--
-Why was I chosen?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.219
Why are you asking me?

26:36.303 --> 26:37.721
His Majesty decided!

26:40.098 --> 26:42.684
-It was His Majesty's decision?
-Of course!

26:49.983 --> 26:52.319
I was against it.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.909
My goodness.

27:01.411 --> 27:04.706
Why is the fog so dense?

27:05.081 --> 27:07.042
It's not your first time fishing.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.419
Haven't you seen a fog like this?

27:10.086 --> 27:12.505
Didn't you hear about the rumors?

27:13.173 --> 27:15.300
They say there's a ghost fish.

27:15.383 --> 27:18.428
Stop wasting your energy talking nonsense.

27:18.595 --> 27:20.013
Hurry up, pull the net.

27:34.819 --> 27:37.113
What are you doing? Haul in the net!

27:43.119 --> 27:44.412
Look there!

27:50.752 --> 27:53.630
His Majesty has arrived!

28:00.178 --> 28:01.012
Your Majesty!

28:01.805 --> 28:04.641
Today, we request to discuss plans

28:04.724 --> 28:08.186
to ease public unrest.

28:08.895 --> 28:12.691
Rumors are spreading like wildfire
among our people.

28:13.024 --> 28:14.984
I'm sure you're aware of it,

28:16.861 --> 28:19.531
spreading rumors is prohibited by law,

28:20.073 --> 28:23.326
and whoever violates it
should be severely punished.

28:24.619 --> 28:26.037
Don't you know this?

28:26.329 --> 28:27.163
However,

28:27.956 --> 28:31.167
you should see
the appearance of a ghost fish

28:31.251 --> 28:33.211
as a sign from heaven.

28:33.336 --> 28:34.170
Your Majesty,

28:34.254 --> 28:37.298
the rumors involving Prince Jaseong

28:37.465 --> 28:39.342
shouldn't be ignored.

28:39.426 --> 28:42.053
-Did you say Prince Jaseong?
-Yes, Majesty.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.807
Prince Jaseong is your brother's son,
Crown Prince Uigyeong.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.643
I shouldn't mention this,

28:48.935 --> 28:52.355
but other descendants will try
to expand their power,

28:52.772 --> 28:55.442
and Prince Jaseong serves a good cause.

28:55.900 --> 28:56.860
That being said,

28:57.318 --> 28:59.404
you must take appropriate measures.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.448
Obo.

29:02.824 --> 29:03.742
Yes, Majesty.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.581
Do you want to know the reality of Joseon?

29:14.252 --> 29:16.629
This is a family tree above second rank.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.215
Doesn't it look like a cobweb?

29:22.802 --> 29:25.221
They came into power by helping the king.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.807
Their power has been growing
for decades.

29:29.642 --> 29:32.353
Through marriage,
they're linked as families.

29:33.521 --> 29:36.357
There are many officials
who rely on their power.

29:36.775 --> 29:37.984
Not only in Hanyang,

29:38.067 --> 29:40.737
but all around the country.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.073
Even though I'm the King,

29:45.700 --> 29:48.453
I can't do anything without their consent.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.290
I can't allow...

29:54.042 --> 29:56.461
Prince Jaseong to stay in Hanyang.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.103
I haven't seen my nephew
for a long time.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.982
He's from the royal family,

30:19.275 --> 30:22.946
so I've kept him away from the Palace,
worried it may hurt you.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.281
Queen Dowager feels lonely, too.

30:25.615 --> 30:28.701
Don't worry,
let him enter the Palace to greet her.

30:30.286 --> 30:31.538
I'll obey your order.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.964
The tea fragrance is nice.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.716
When my brother was alive,

30:45.385 --> 30:46.928
I used to drink this tea.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.556
If you like the tea,

30:50.306 --> 30:52.308
I'll have some sent to the Palace.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.894
That would be wonderful.

30:55.895 --> 30:56.729
Your Majesty!

30:57.605 --> 30:58.606
Your Majesty!

31:08.950 --> 31:12.495
I was getting ready to be punished.

31:13.371 --> 31:14.205
Why?

31:15.039 --> 31:16.833
Is it because of the rumors?

31:17.667 --> 31:19.168
It's all because of me.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.546
Please, punish me.

31:22.046 --> 31:24.132
They are baseless rumors.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.301
Don't listen to them.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.387
Let me look at you.

31:30.263 --> 31:31.848
You've become a man.

31:33.099 --> 31:34.726
Are you 12 already?

31:35.184 --> 31:36.227
Yes, Majesty.

31:37.270 --> 31:39.105
Right. You're a big man now.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.609
You should travel the country,
acquire some knowledge.

31:43.109 --> 31:45.820
New ideas and cultures are in harmony

31:45.904 --> 31:47.739
with the emerging new era.

31:48.197 --> 31:50.158
When you return, after learning,

31:50.241 --> 31:52.619
you'll be a valued citizen.

31:53.786 --> 31:57.248
In the future, you should look
at the bigger world,

31:58.333 --> 32:00.126
and have great ambition.

32:01.628 --> 32:04.380
Yes, Majesty. I'll make sure to do that.

33:04.107 --> 33:08.027
Your Majesty, last night,
Prince Jaseong was kidnapped.

33:23.793 --> 33:24.919
Who are you?

33:28.464 --> 33:32.093
You're very commanding,
even in this situation.

33:32.885 --> 33:36.639
The royal family blood is different.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.144
Don't look at me like that.

33:42.270 --> 33:45.732
I might be able to put you on the throne--

33:45.815 --> 33:46.983
The throne?

33:47.066 --> 33:48.401
How can you say that?

34:01.247 --> 34:02.290
Prince Jaseong,

34:04.834 --> 34:07.879
if I ask you to die, you will die.

34:09.088 --> 34:10.715
If I want you to be a King,

34:11.674 --> 34:13.968
then you'll become a King.

34:26.064 --> 34:26.898
Your Majesty.

34:28.357 --> 34:31.444
Ask the Ministry of Justice
to search for the prince.

34:32.278 --> 34:34.322
According to witnesses,

34:35.323 --> 34:38.451
the fish found in Gwangnaru was
around 49 feet.

34:40.620 --> 34:41.454
Your Majesty…

34:43.748 --> 34:45.124
Forty-nine feet...

34:46.793 --> 34:49.796
If it's that big,
it's fair to call it a ghost fish.

34:50.421 --> 34:51.255
Right?

34:52.340 --> 34:53.424
What do you think?

34:54.425 --> 34:57.053
Do you think we have
such a thing in Joseon?

35:01.432 --> 35:04.811
I feel exhausted due to a heavy workload.

35:05.978 --> 35:08.564
I'm afraid I'll get sick.

35:09.190 --> 35:10.191
With that said,

35:11.317 --> 35:14.612
I thought about taking you all
on a cruise as a thank you

35:15.113 --> 35:16.906
for your hard work.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.579
Where should we go?

35:25.790 --> 35:29.961
Majesty, how can we go on a cruise
during this political instability?

35:30.378 --> 35:32.588
That is utterly unreasonable.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.008
What's wrong with the politics?

35:36.092 --> 35:38.928
We heard Prince Jaseong
disappeared last night.

35:39.428 --> 35:40.805
Rumors say that he hid

35:41.097 --> 35:45.685
in order to gather traitors
and take the throne.

35:46.227 --> 35:49.063
What do you mean
Prince Jaseong has disappeared?

35:50.148 --> 35:51.649
I ordered Prince Jaseong

35:51.732 --> 35:54.735
to investigate the iron ore problem
in Hamgil.

35:56.028 --> 35:59.115
Due to the iron ore crisis,
the production of weapons

35:59.198 --> 36:02.285
and necessities of our people
became a major issue.

36:02.869 --> 36:06.247
I've asked our very clever
Prince Jaseong to solve it.

36:06.873 --> 36:09.584
What proof do you have
against Prince Jaseong?

36:11.043 --> 36:14.755
If you don't want to drive a wedge
between me and my relatives,

36:20.553 --> 36:22.221
don't ever say that again.

36:25.808 --> 36:28.019
Royal Secretary, prepare a boat.

36:31.522 --> 36:32.648
The location is...

36:35.026 --> 36:35.860
Gwangnaru.

36:38.404 --> 36:40.740
It feels good to get out of the Palace.

36:43.534 --> 36:44.368
What's wrong?

36:45.786 --> 36:48.164
Are you afraid there's a ghost fish?

36:48.247 --> 36:51.709
Your Majesty, many people have seen it.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.086
Even if the rumor is true,

36:54.462 --> 36:57.965
you're with Joseon's best swordsman.
So, why worry about it?

37:03.512 --> 37:04.597
Right.

37:05.806 --> 37:07.350
Why that long face?

37:07.683 --> 37:11.312
Your Majesty,
although the ghost fish is important,

37:13.189 --> 37:15.566
we should look for Prince Jaseong first.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.484
Majesty...

37:17.902 --> 37:20.446
-Your Majesty.
-They won't kill him.

37:21.614 --> 37:24.200
Or they wouldn't have kidnapped him.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.792
What is that?

37:38.673 --> 37:39.966
Look!

37:40.549 --> 37:41.634
Your Majesty!

37:44.887 --> 37:45.721
Your Majesty!

37:46.973 --> 37:48.307
So it is really true.

37:48.849 --> 37:49.850
Your Majesty!

37:59.860 --> 38:03.990
Row!

38:04.490 --> 38:05.574
Majesty, they're…

38:06.575 --> 38:08.369
They're whalers' descendants.

38:08.703 --> 38:11.372
Today, we'll catch a ghost fish,
not a whale.

38:12.456 --> 38:16.794
Row!

38:17.503 --> 38:18.337
Let's go, Obo.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.382
Where are we going?

38:22.258 --> 38:23.676
To catch a ghost fish.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.390
-This is a rare experience.
-Majesty!

38:39.608 --> 38:40.568
Let's go.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.661
Row!

38:51.037 --> 38:55.541
Row!

38:57.001 --> 39:01.756
Row!

39:06.761 --> 39:11.057
Row!

39:13.559 --> 39:15.603
Row!

39:18.272 --> 39:22.777
Row!

39:30.576 --> 39:32.995
It's a hit!

39:36.290 --> 39:38.709
-Stop!
-It's a hit!

39:49.970 --> 39:50.805
Your Majesty!

39:52.098 --> 39:54.892
Turn the boat around! Hurry up!

39:55.518 --> 39:56.685
Grab the boat!

39:57.061 --> 39:58.229
What are you doing?

39:58.562 --> 39:59.397
Hurry!

39:59.980 --> 40:00.815
No!

40:01.816 --> 40:02.817
Keep going.

40:04.443 --> 40:06.445
Obo, hold me.

40:06.737 --> 40:12.243
Row!

40:12.368 --> 40:13.744
I apologize in advance!

40:13.828 --> 40:15.871
Row!

41:01.167 --> 41:02.042
Mother!

41:24.607 --> 41:28.277
Call the royal physician!

41:33.365 --> 41:36.452
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty, are you all right?

41:38.245 --> 41:39.914
Majesty, please wake up!

41:43.292 --> 41:44.627
-Majesty.
-Majesty!

41:45.044 --> 41:46.879
You can't die like this!

41:47.254 --> 41:49.006
Your Majesty!

41:49.965 --> 41:53.302
Your Majesty!

41:54.386 --> 41:55.387
Obo.

41:57.473 --> 41:59.975
I'll be fine if you shut up.

42:00.768 --> 42:01.852
Are you all right?

42:17.493 --> 42:20.663
I'm sure the harpoon hit the fish.

42:21.747 --> 42:25.042
But it's like the harpoon was thrown
into an empty space.

42:25.334 --> 42:26.794
I didn't feel anything.

42:28.003 --> 42:31.507
I'm pretty sure the harpoon I threw
hit the body of a fish.

42:32.967 --> 42:33.842
However,

42:34.510 --> 42:35.886
I didn't feel anything.

42:38.597 --> 42:40.683
A ghost fish...

42:48.607 --> 42:49.441
Obo.

42:51.110 --> 42:53.362
Do you think that was a ghost fish?

42:53.779 --> 42:55.948
You saw it, too.

42:56.865 --> 42:59.243
With your own eyes.
How can you doubt it?

43:00.619 --> 43:02.288
Anything suspicious?

43:06.458 --> 43:07.876
It was pretty chaotic.

43:09.461 --> 43:10.296
So, nothing.

43:13.215 --> 43:14.049
Hey.

43:14.633 --> 43:15.467
Hey.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.179
Don't just follow me around

43:19.305 --> 43:22.099
bothering me all the time.

43:22.683 --> 43:24.518
Can't you help once in a while?

43:27.104 --> 43:30.441
-I saved your life today...
-Are you bragging about it?

43:33.485 --> 43:35.112
Don't just sit around!

43:35.195 --> 43:36.655
I'm done drawing.

43:37.740 --> 43:39.825
Why are you grinding an ink stick?

43:40.784 --> 43:42.786
You're so frustrating.

43:52.671 --> 43:55.341
What is it?
Did you remember something?

44:19.990 --> 44:22.076
-Your Majesty!
-You scared me.

44:24.870 --> 44:26.413
Underneath the ghost fish…

44:32.878 --> 44:34.630
I saw a big turtle.

44:36.256 --> 44:37.091
A turtle?

44:38.759 --> 44:39.593
Yes.

44:43.263 --> 44:45.140
-Obo.
-Yes, Majesty.

44:45.516 --> 44:47.893
The rumors don't mention a turtle.

44:47.976 --> 44:49.687
Why do you think that is?

44:52.398 --> 44:56.527
Whoever started the rumors
didn't want us to know about the turtle.

44:56.902 --> 44:57.736
That's right.

44:58.779 --> 45:00.322
If they want to hide that,

45:00.406 --> 45:02.157
it means I must find out why.

45:11.917 --> 45:14.545
Have you heard of a shaman
named Seon-hwa?

45:14.920 --> 45:15.963
No.

45:16.630 --> 45:19.967
She is very popular.

45:20.926 --> 45:23.887
She can see the future.

45:25.139 --> 45:26.014
And...

45:26.724 --> 45:28.600
this shaman showed up here

45:28.684 --> 45:31.645
at the same time
this rumor started to spread.

45:33.856 --> 45:35.858
Do you think the shaman is the one

45:35.941 --> 45:37.693
who started the rumors?

45:39.778 --> 45:41.196
Obo, what do you think?

45:42.114 --> 45:45.993
What could a shaman gain
from spreading such a rumor?

45:46.410 --> 45:48.495
That's why we have to go see her.

45:51.999 --> 45:55.419
Let me see. What should I wear today?

46:05.971 --> 46:06.972
What is this?

46:09.975 --> 46:12.060
-Am I wrong?
-What are you doing?

46:15.063 --> 46:16.774
Hurry up, get changed.

46:18.942 --> 46:20.235
Are you curious?

46:20.986 --> 46:21.820
Yes.

46:22.780 --> 46:25.240
This is specially made for magic.

46:27.826 --> 46:28.911
Here, take a look.

46:29.495 --> 46:30.829
-It's empty.
-Yes.

46:42.424 --> 46:43.258
Take a look.

46:51.892 --> 46:53.852
Magic is about tricking the eyes.

46:54.686 --> 46:55.521
But in here...

46:57.648 --> 46:59.775
is where the logic and nature lies.

47:06.949 --> 47:10.035
In France, I heard this symbol
represents the King.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.289
Do you know magic?

47:14.373 --> 47:17.251
The magician who taught me magic
once told me

47:17.376 --> 47:19.127
that my hands are exquisite

47:19.211 --> 47:21.547
and I'd become Joseon's best magician.

47:25.801 --> 47:26.635
I see.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.972
What? Don't you trust me?

47:30.347 --> 47:32.224
No, I trust you.

47:33.725 --> 47:36.353
-Obo!
-Your Majesty, are you all right?

47:37.354 --> 47:38.188
Majesty!

47:38.272 --> 47:40.691
Your Majesty! What's going on?

47:42.067 --> 47:43.235
Seriously?

47:45.988 --> 47:47.155
Seriously?

47:49.575 --> 47:50.492
Seriously what?

47:53.829 --> 47:54.663
What about it?

47:55.831 --> 47:56.665
Nothing.

48:00.794 --> 48:02.546
I heard you wanted to quit.

48:04.298 --> 48:05.382
That's ridiculous.

48:07.759 --> 48:08.844
Your Majesty,

48:09.845 --> 48:10.804
that's not true.

48:32.200 --> 48:35.621
Don't forget, once we get in the shrine,
act like a friend.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.665
-Yes, Majesty.
-Don't call me Majesty.

48:43.128 --> 48:44.212
Okay, my friend.

48:46.965 --> 48:47.966
Like that, right?

48:49.968 --> 48:51.011
Are you crazy?

48:54.431 --> 48:55.891
Aren't you leaving?

49:21.917 --> 49:24.920
What troubles do you have
that brought you here?

49:29.925 --> 49:30.759
Your Majesty.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.060
My name is Majesty!

49:44.356 --> 49:46.066
My friend, Jeon-ha,

49:46.566 --> 49:48.068
has so many worries.

49:48.735 --> 49:49.945
He's so sensitive.

49:51.154 --> 49:51.989
You jerk.

49:55.033 --> 49:58.161
Who has no worries these days?

49:58.745 --> 50:00.747
I have nothing to worry about.

50:00.831 --> 50:04.501
He wants to serve in the Royal Palace.
What is his future like?

50:04.835 --> 50:06.712
Can I be his friend?

50:08.630 --> 50:09.506
He...

50:10.924 --> 50:13.802
He has an exceptional talent.

50:14.094 --> 50:15.178
Do you mean me?

50:18.765 --> 50:20.308
You will serve the King.

50:20.767 --> 50:23.812
Your talent will guide the King
to govern well.

50:25.564 --> 50:26.398
However...

50:27.149 --> 50:30.152
I'm not sure
whether your talent will be fully used.

50:31.486 --> 50:33.321
The King lacks virtue,

50:33.864 --> 50:35.532
and he is very incompetent--

50:37.159 --> 50:38.368
Watch your mouth.

50:49.713 --> 50:51.965
This jar contains auspicious souls.

50:52.841 --> 50:55.510
Ask the souls if the King is worthy

50:56.803 --> 50:58.388
of your service.

51:22.579 --> 51:24.498
The souls are agitated.

51:40.722 --> 51:42.182
The souls calmed down.

51:42.724 --> 51:44.643
I've calmed them for now.

51:44.893 --> 51:46.853
Their anger toward the King is...

51:47.354 --> 51:49.272
just the beginning.

51:59.950 --> 52:00.784
Let's go.

52:02.327 --> 52:03.912
Let's just go.

52:04.371 --> 52:05.539
Hurry up.

52:08.375 --> 52:09.709
What's wrong with you?

52:13.588 --> 52:14.589
What did you say?

52:16.466 --> 52:17.968
Let's go, my friend.

52:18.635 --> 52:20.387
Thank you.

52:22.097 --> 52:22.931
Goodbye.

52:29.688 --> 52:31.690
Are you thinking about the shaman?

52:32.566 --> 52:34.568
-No.
-Yes, you are.

52:35.777 --> 52:37.779
You don't say what's in your mind.

52:41.575 --> 52:42.409
Here.

52:45.912 --> 52:46.830
When did you...

52:48.498 --> 52:49.583
When do you think?

52:51.126 --> 52:52.460
What's wrong with you?

52:52.878 --> 52:54.254
What did you say?

52:55.547 --> 52:56.464
Let's go.

53:04.681 --> 53:05.974
-Drink it.
-Pardon?

53:09.978 --> 53:11.354
You want me to drink...

53:12.439 --> 53:14.441
-some kind of ghost water?
-Why?

53:15.025 --> 53:17.444
Won't you? This is a royal order.

53:19.613 --> 53:20.572
How could...

53:23.658 --> 53:25.785
-This...
-I understand.

53:26.453 --> 53:27.662
There's no choice.

53:27.913 --> 53:31.416
-What are you doing?
-If you won't drink, there's no choice.

53:31.499 --> 53:33.210
-I have to.
-You shouldn't!

53:33.293 --> 53:35.086
-Don't stop me.
-Give it to me.

53:35.170 --> 53:37.422
Give it to me.

53:37.505 --> 53:38.840
What's wrong with you?

53:41.092 --> 53:41.927
Here.

53:43.386 --> 53:44.304
No?

53:49.893 --> 53:50.727
Seriously?

54:00.695 --> 54:02.322
-This...
-What is it?

54:02.405 --> 54:03.365
This thing is...

54:05.283 --> 54:06.368
-fizzy.
-Fizzy?

54:06.493 --> 54:07.702
The water is bubbly.

54:18.964 --> 54:21.716
Here. Keep it safe.

54:27.264 --> 54:29.641
Majesty, the Palace is not this way.

54:30.350 --> 54:31.476
Be quiet.

54:31.601 --> 54:33.436
-Someone is following us.
-What?

54:48.994 --> 54:50.370
Are you looking for me?

54:58.378 --> 55:01.298
By your expression,
you must know who I am.

55:03.842 --> 55:07.345
Do you think the King would walk around
without an escort?

55:07.846 --> 55:10.265
Let me offer you
a more suitable opponent.

55:10.682 --> 55:11.516
Heuk-woon!

55:15.103 --> 55:15.937
Heuk-woon!

55:24.696 --> 55:25.530
Heuk-woon.

55:25.947 --> 55:27.407
-Where are you?
-Majesty.

55:31.328 --> 55:32.329
Heuk-woon!

55:33.038 --> 55:33.872
Your Majesty!

55:49.095 --> 55:50.180
My gosh!

55:54.100 --> 55:56.561
Do you have to show up
at the last minute?

55:56.686 --> 55:57.854
Is this on purpose?

55:58.897 --> 56:00.231
Give me your order.

56:01.066 --> 56:02.192
What?

56:02.776 --> 56:03.818
Don't kill him.

56:10.408 --> 56:11.534
Who is he, Majesty?

56:12.410 --> 56:15.830
Heuk-woon, the swordsman
responsible for my protection.

56:55.995 --> 56:57.372
It's my fault, Majesty.

56:59.958 --> 57:00.792
That's fine.

57:01.709 --> 57:04.212
You can't stop a man from killing himself.

57:23.606 --> 57:25.275
I'm not his only servant.

57:27.777 --> 57:31.406
I've studied hard for 15 years
and I excelled in the test.

57:32.782 --> 57:33.950
But look at me now.

57:40.790 --> 57:44.461
He wants me to be a chronicle keeper,
a dokwang and a butcher?

57:45.670 --> 57:46.796
It looks good.

57:54.804 --> 57:57.098
Your Majesty, do you feel better

57:57.182 --> 57:58.766
if you bully me like this?

58:02.854 --> 58:04.063
It's an Ilhwangdo.

58:09.986 --> 58:11.154
What is that?

58:12.530 --> 58:14.782
It's the Jurchen people's weapon.

58:15.825 --> 58:17.744
Why'd they attack Your Majesty?

58:23.041 --> 58:24.042
Interesting.

58:28.296 --> 58:30.715
Do you know the Sipin Village, in Hamgil?

58:33.885 --> 58:35.303
There was an incident.

58:35.386 --> 58:38.306
The village people were attacked
and slaughtered.

58:46.314 --> 58:49.484
They were secretly investigating
the iron ore for me,

58:50.026 --> 58:53.154
Dokwang Hong and his men.

58:55.323 --> 58:59.118
What you're looking at
is Hong Min-seok's autopsy report.

59:02.038 --> 59:04.666
Does it look familiar?

59:06.793 --> 59:08.336
The wound in the pig skin.

59:09.003 --> 59:11.673
Pig skin is the most similar
to human skin.

59:13.299 --> 59:15.343
I finally know who's responsible.

59:18.179 --> 59:21.724
The Jurchen crossed the border
and killed Hong Min-seok.

59:23.309 --> 59:25.562
This is more twisted than I expected.

1:00:07.770 --> 1:00:08.813
Gosh!

1:00:16.529 --> 1:00:19.699
This is a new volley invented
by the Military bureau.

1:00:20.617 --> 1:00:21.743
It's longer,

1:00:22.285 --> 1:00:25.496
so the accuracy and range are
greatly improved.

1:00:41.471 --> 1:00:44.057
-Curious about that jar's secret?
-Pardon?

1:00:44.641 --> 1:00:45.600
Are you curious?

1:00:48.436 --> 1:00:49.270
Yes.

1:00:51.064 --> 1:00:52.523
So, come here and shoot.

1:00:53.566 --> 1:00:55.985
No, thank you, Majesty.

1:00:56.486 --> 1:00:58.863
If you hit one target after three shots,

1:00:59.405 --> 1:01:01.074
I'll tell you the secret.

1:01:03.618 --> 1:01:05.536
-I don't need to know.
-Come on!

1:01:06.245 --> 1:01:08.539
You should challenge yourself.

1:01:10.958 --> 1:01:11.793
Fine.

1:01:12.669 --> 1:01:15.171
I'll give you five shots instead of three.

1:01:16.381 --> 1:01:17.215
Really?

1:01:17.924 --> 1:01:18.758
Of course!

1:01:19.467 --> 1:01:20.301
Then...

1:01:22.470 --> 1:01:24.555
Hold it tight. Watch the recoil.

1:01:25.098 --> 1:01:26.182
Okay.

1:01:48.579 --> 1:01:49.455
Obo.

1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:52.792
It's not your first time firing a gun.

1:01:53.292 --> 1:01:55.837
I never said it was my first time.

1:01:57.714 --> 1:01:58.548
What?

1:01:59.799 --> 1:02:02.176
Do you know who invented the new volley?

1:02:02.260 --> 1:02:04.137
Yoon Yi-mok. From the Military.

1:02:06.055 --> 1:02:08.266
Yoon Yi-mok? Yoon Yi-seo?

1:02:09.142 --> 1:02:10.476
He's my older brother.

1:02:10.810 --> 1:02:12.270
When he was researching,

1:02:12.353 --> 1:02:14.397
he'd always asked me to shoot--

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:15.940
Enough, you sneaky jerk.

1:02:18.818 --> 1:02:20.027
It's nothing new.

1:02:27.702 --> 1:02:31.622
Salt reacts with the carbon acid
in the mineral water,

1:02:31.706 --> 1:02:35.209
and produces bubbles.
This is a chemical reaction.

1:02:35.376 --> 1:02:39.505
The bubbles will find a way to escape,
which causes the coin to shake.

1:02:40.548 --> 1:02:41.382
Your Majesty!

1:02:43.885 --> 1:02:45.261
How did you find out?

1:02:47.972 --> 1:02:49.098
Jang Yeong-sil.

1:02:52.268 --> 1:02:54.520
While you were asleep last night,

1:02:54.937 --> 1:02:58.316
Jikjehak spent the night
looking for this in the storage.

1:02:59.150 --> 1:03:02.528
This book contains the core
of Jang Yeong-sil's research.

1:03:03.529 --> 1:03:04.989
Incompetent people.

1:03:05.364 --> 1:03:09.368
They should've placed this gem
in the Royal Library not in storage.

1:03:09.869 --> 1:03:11.370
Is this book important?

1:03:13.831 --> 1:03:16.626
This book also teaches
how to make a ghost fish.

1:03:17.210 --> 1:03:19.253
It tells how to make...

1:03:20.129 --> 1:03:22.548
-a ghost fish?
-To be precise, no.

1:03:24.300 --> 1:03:26.969
It teaches how to make a big turtle.

1:03:27.637 --> 1:03:28.846
I found it, Majesty!

1:03:35.102 --> 1:03:36.813
This is called a submarine.

1:03:37.313 --> 1:03:38.564
It moves underwater.

1:03:39.649 --> 1:03:42.276
A boat that moves underwater?

1:03:42.735 --> 1:03:45.488
Yes. First, an oak tree is cut in half.

1:03:46.781 --> 1:03:49.992
Then you dig out the inside of a tree
to make a barrel.

1:03:50.868 --> 1:03:53.371
The barrel is wrapped with barbed wire.

1:03:54.497 --> 1:03:56.499
To make sure water doesn't get in,

1:03:56.582 --> 1:03:59.836
a special powder made of pine resin
and lime is applied.

1:04:00.503 --> 1:04:04.799
When an internal device is operated
and the barrel is filled with water,

1:04:05.842 --> 1:04:09.136
buoyancy lessens
and the barrel will submerge.

1:04:10.638 --> 1:04:13.140
If the turtle I saw was
a mechanical device

1:04:13.224 --> 1:04:16.143
-made by someone--
-If we can find that out,

1:04:16.686 --> 1:04:19.188
we'll find out the truth about the rumors.

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:20.314
But first,

1:04:21.023 --> 1:04:23.568
we'll read all about Jang Yeong-sil.

1:04:58.352 --> 1:05:00.354
Your Majesty, take a look at this!

1:05:04.734 --> 1:05:06.193
According to this,

1:05:06.277 --> 1:05:09.238
his descendant,
Jang Nam-ju, is still alive.

1:05:09.322 --> 1:05:14.452
And according to the land purchase record,
Jang Nam-ju bought a house.

1:05:14.535 --> 1:05:15.578
But...

1:05:16.829 --> 1:05:18.289
But it's located in...

1:05:21.208 --> 1:05:22.043
Gwangnaru.

1:05:30.885 --> 1:05:32.136
It was here.

1:05:35.348 --> 1:05:36.807
-Obo.
-Yes.

1:05:37.266 --> 1:05:39.101
It's pretty scary here.

1:05:40.436 --> 1:05:43.397
Never be more than three steps
from me. Understood?

1:05:47.693 --> 1:05:48.694
You're Sambo now!

1:06:11.676 --> 1:06:14.303
Your Majesty, I think it's just a mill.

1:06:14.845 --> 1:06:17.139
-We should go back.
-Sambo!

1:06:18.432 --> 1:06:19.266
Yes?

1:06:21.936 --> 1:06:24.855
You shouldn't believe
everything you see here.

1:06:33.030 --> 1:06:33.864
Your Majesty.

1:06:46.043 --> 1:06:48.462
I think what we're seeing is all that is.

1:06:48.671 --> 1:06:50.297
Let's just go.

1:07:04.186 --> 1:07:06.022
Apparently, you know something.

1:07:08.607 --> 1:07:10.192
-Hold this.
-Okay.

1:07:12.486 --> 1:07:13.320
Giddy up!

1:07:16.115 --> 1:07:17.033
Giddy up!

1:07:17.825 --> 1:07:18.659
Giddy up!

1:07:20.286 --> 1:07:21.120
Giddy up!

1:07:39.805 --> 1:07:41.223
We found it, Sambo!

1:07:47.438 --> 1:07:51.275
How did they know I love secret tunnels?

1:07:53.778 --> 1:07:54.653
Your Majesty.

1:07:55.404 --> 1:07:56.238
Please don't.

1:07:57.156 --> 1:07:58.199
Follow me, Sambo.

1:08:05.956 --> 1:08:08.250
We're definitely not a match.

1:08:15.758 --> 1:08:16.842
No!

1:08:21.222 --> 1:08:22.264
You're so clumsy.

1:08:23.224 --> 1:08:25.017
Sambo, you're such a crybaby.

1:08:30.523 --> 1:08:32.942
-I think I broke my leg.
-Watch your head.

1:08:38.322 --> 1:08:39.323
Seriously?

1:09:14.483 --> 1:09:16.193
This must be the ghost fish.

1:09:20.614 --> 1:09:21.699
Your Majesty!

1:09:23.367 --> 1:09:24.952
This is the turtle I saw!

1:09:26.662 --> 1:09:28.164
I see.

1:09:29.081 --> 1:09:31.167
This is very well made.

1:09:35.754 --> 1:09:38.382
This is where they connect the ghost fish.

1:09:42.511 --> 1:09:43.596
Look, Sambo.

1:09:44.763 --> 1:09:46.724
They even made bombs.

1:09:47.892 --> 1:09:49.351
This is amazing.

1:09:56.025 --> 1:09:58.319
Your Majesty, look at this!

1:09:58.402 --> 1:09:59.486
What is it?

1:10:05.534 --> 1:10:07.244
Hong Min-seok's diary.

1:10:07.328 --> 1:10:08.537
Wasn't he...

1:10:09.246 --> 1:10:11.707
the dokwang who died in Sipin Village?

1:10:19.256 --> 1:10:20.507
The diary says

1:10:21.884 --> 1:10:25.679
that Hong Min-seok discovered
a large area of outcrop in Hamgil.

1:10:26.222 --> 1:10:27.348
What's an outcrop?

1:10:27.848 --> 1:10:31.936
It's a rock formation
visible on the surface, that allow us

1:10:32.728 --> 1:10:35.981
to predict the amount of ore
buried underground.

1:10:36.357 --> 1:10:38.359
It says the estimated amount is...

1:10:39.860 --> 1:10:41.487
around 50 million geun.

1:10:42.029 --> 1:10:42.905
Fifty million?

1:10:43.197 --> 1:10:46.492
Last year, the total found
in all eight provinces was...

1:10:47.451 --> 1:10:48.702
less than 50 million.

1:10:50.204 --> 1:10:52.081
That's a huge amount of ore.

1:10:53.832 --> 1:10:55.584
But why is the diary here?

1:11:01.799 --> 1:11:02.925
Hamgil Province...

1:11:04.593 --> 1:11:05.678
Sipin Village...

1:11:07.179 --> 1:11:10.432
Hong Min-seok is killed
while on a secret investigation.

1:11:10.933 --> 1:11:14.979
Rumors are spreading like wildfire
among our people.

1:11:15.062 --> 1:11:17.273
I'm sure you're already aware of it.

1:11:17.356 --> 1:11:20.442
The same method was used
to kill the Jeong Dokwang.

1:11:20.526 --> 1:11:21.902
Your Majesty,

1:11:21.986 --> 1:11:25.447
the rumors involving Prince Jaseong
shouldn't be ignored.

1:11:26.865 --> 1:11:29.702
You should see
the appearance of a ghost fish

1:11:29.785 --> 1:11:31.787
as a sign from heaven.

1:11:33.414 --> 1:11:36.667
The appearance of a ghost fish.
The curse of the shaman.

1:11:38.627 --> 1:11:40.004
Jurchen tailing me.

1:11:41.255 --> 1:11:43.340
Send the Northern army to the South

1:11:43.757 --> 1:11:45.926
to strengthen the Hansung security.

1:11:46.343 --> 1:11:48.887
Please consider this suggestion.

1:11:50.139 --> 1:11:51.932
Now everything makes sense.

1:11:53.267 --> 1:11:55.477
The Northern region is the cause

1:11:56.562 --> 1:11:57.980
of this incident.

1:12:01.442 --> 1:12:02.276
Nam Gun-hee!

1:12:04.028 --> 1:12:07.448
It's weird that the Northern region
suddenly became quiet.

1:12:08.574 --> 1:12:10.617
Nam Gun-hee caused that.

1:12:12.786 --> 1:12:13.620
Nam Gun-hee...

1:12:14.163 --> 1:12:15.497
He spread the rumors,

1:12:15.831 --> 1:12:18.709
he kidnapped Prince Jaseong,
and caused the chaos

1:12:18.792 --> 1:12:20.252
to dethrone me.

1:12:21.837 --> 1:12:24.923
-Even being blinded by power--
-It's not about power.

1:12:25.507 --> 1:12:27.217
They want to monopolize

1:12:27.593 --> 1:12:29.553
this country's resources.

1:12:31.347 --> 1:12:32.806
They want the iron ore.

1:12:40.272 --> 1:12:41.106
Your Majesty,

1:12:42.649 --> 1:12:43.609
what's going on?

1:12:44.985 --> 1:12:46.862
Shaman, open it!

1:12:47.613 --> 1:12:48.614
Open it now!

1:12:48.864 --> 1:12:49.740
I'm impressed.

1:12:50.741 --> 1:12:52.493
How did you find this place?

1:12:53.869 --> 1:12:55.496
You really are the King.

1:12:56.914 --> 1:12:58.957
As I expected. You're Jang Nam-ju.

1:12:59.541 --> 1:13:01.335
You even know my name.

1:13:01.752 --> 1:13:03.253
Open the door. Now!

1:13:04.588 --> 1:13:05.506
Why would you…

1:13:06.715 --> 1:13:08.926
participate in this despicable plot?

1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:12.930
Why would people go after money and power?

1:13:13.472 --> 1:13:15.724
Why'd they kidnap my powerless father,

1:13:16.350 --> 1:13:19.311
and try to do
what they're not supposed to?

1:13:20.854 --> 1:13:22.314
What's their reason?

1:13:22.815 --> 1:13:25.984
Nam Gun-hee took your father
and threatened you.

1:13:28.821 --> 1:13:32.241
You should be punished for treason,
but I'll forgive you

1:13:32.741 --> 1:13:35.661
because you were trying
to save your father.

1:13:36.453 --> 1:13:39.790
If you change your mind
and help stabilize the country,

1:13:40.791 --> 1:13:42.209
I won't punish you.

1:13:43.710 --> 1:13:44.545
So,

1:13:45.671 --> 1:13:46.922
open this door now!

1:13:54.054 --> 1:13:55.722
I'm grateful for your words,

1:13:57.099 --> 1:13:58.350
Your Majesty.

1:13:59.435 --> 1:14:00.269
However,

1:14:02.104 --> 1:14:04.273
he's more frightening than Majesty.

1:14:05.607 --> 1:14:06.817
As a daughter,

1:14:08.235 --> 1:14:10.487
I can't gamble with my father's life.

1:14:10.779 --> 1:14:11.613
What?

1:14:12.865 --> 1:14:15.117
-What's going on?
-What are you doing?

1:14:15.742 --> 1:14:16.869
-Your Majesty!
-You!

1:14:17.744 --> 1:14:19.496
-Don't do this.
-How dare you?

1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:21.457
-Why?
-Let's talk!

1:14:21.790 --> 1:14:22.624
Come back!

1:14:23.125 --> 1:14:24.293
Come back!

1:14:27.254 --> 1:14:29.214
-Sambo, we're doomed.
-Bombs!

1:14:29.673 --> 1:14:32.009
Your Majesty! Heuk-woon!

1:14:32.509 --> 1:14:34.761
Please call Heuk-woon! Where is he?

1:14:35.888 --> 1:14:37.014
Heuk-woon!

1:14:37.431 --> 1:14:39.558
I sent Heuk-woon to do other things.

1:14:40.392 --> 1:14:42.686
Did you come here without Heuk-woon?

1:14:43.312 --> 1:14:45.522
Who knew such a thing could happen?

1:14:45.647 --> 1:14:47.191
You should've brought him!

1:14:47.274 --> 1:14:49.193
Gosh! Don't get mad at me.

1:14:49.276 --> 1:14:51.361
Think of something. Think!

1:15:02.873 --> 1:15:04.082
It is over.

1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:13.008
Where's my father?

1:15:15.135 --> 1:15:16.220
You promised...

1:15:17.054 --> 1:15:18.805
my father would be released.

1:15:20.182 --> 1:15:21.183
Your father is...

1:15:23.393 --> 1:15:24.228
over there.

1:15:27.189 --> 1:15:28.065
Over there.

1:15:33.820 --> 1:15:34.821
Don't tell me...

1:16:24.663 --> 1:16:26.707
Prepare to sit on the throne.

1:16:29.293 --> 1:16:30.627
Take him with respect.

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:34.298
Let me go! Where is the King?

1:16:34.965 --> 1:16:35.841
Let go!

1:16:40.846 --> 1:16:44.433
It feels like a huge weight has been
lifted off my shoulders!

1:16:44.516 --> 1:16:47.185
Finally, everything went how we planned!

1:16:47.561 --> 1:16:49.646
The pillar of the country is burnt!

1:16:50.063 --> 1:16:52.107
It's time to fill that with joy!

1:16:53.317 --> 1:16:56.820
It's better to use a child as a puppet!

1:16:56.903 --> 1:16:59.406
Watch your mouth.

1:17:09.333 --> 1:17:13.670
His Majesty has arrived!

1:17:18.925 --> 1:17:23.347
His Majesty has arrived!

1:18:03.095 --> 1:18:07.099
Majesty! This submarine is a lot bigger
than the path we came in.

1:18:07.974 --> 1:18:09.893
There has to be another way out!

1:18:12.312 --> 1:18:13.146
Your Majesty!

1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:15.273
-There's water below us.
-What?

1:18:16.983 --> 1:18:17.818
Water!

1:18:20.237 --> 1:18:23.198
There must be an opening
on the floor. Look for it!

1:18:37.713 --> 1:18:40.507
Sambo, I think you just saved our lives.

1:18:40.674 --> 1:18:42.676
We don't have much time. Hurry up!

1:19:09.536 --> 1:19:10.370
Help!

1:19:13.707 --> 1:19:15.751
Help!

1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:39.649
I slept in.

1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:42.527
I hope I didn't make you wait long.

1:19:43.361 --> 1:19:45.197
It'll never happen again.

1:19:46.156 --> 1:19:47.449
Please forgive me.

1:19:48.074 --> 1:19:49.075
What?

1:19:50.243 --> 1:19:51.787
Is there a problem?

1:19:54.498 --> 1:19:57.167
Royal Secretary,
what are we discussing today?

1:19:57.626 --> 1:20:01.630
We need more military to save people
from the recent flood...

1:20:02.172 --> 1:20:05.550
What the hell did you do?

1:20:07.052 --> 1:20:10.555
Do you know what you've done to us?

1:20:12.557 --> 1:20:14.684
You ignorant, bastard slave!

1:20:15.310 --> 1:20:18.438
It was my mistake to trust you
for your swordsmanship.

1:20:18.772 --> 1:20:20.690
If the King knows everything,

1:20:21.274 --> 1:20:22.776
what are you going to do?

1:20:23.777 --> 1:20:24.861
Why are you quiet?

1:20:25.111 --> 1:20:26.446
Are you ignoring me?

1:20:26.530 --> 1:20:29.282
You should answer me!

1:20:38.124 --> 1:20:40.460
You are talking too much.

1:20:41.753 --> 1:20:44.297
You're always ordering me around.

1:20:45.632 --> 1:20:47.300
Your mouth never shuts.

1:20:50.679 --> 1:20:51.555
Look.

1:20:53.014 --> 1:20:54.599
Let's not do this.

1:20:55.016 --> 1:20:56.935
The King is ready to act.

1:20:57.018 --> 1:20:58.812
Let's calm down,

1:20:59.396 --> 1:21:01.147
and come up with a plan.

1:21:04.651 --> 1:21:05.485
I think...

1:21:06.236 --> 1:21:08.280
I lost my temper.

1:21:18.832 --> 1:21:19.666
If...

1:21:20.375 --> 1:21:22.335
If the King found it all out,

1:21:23.753 --> 1:21:24.880
what should we do?

1:21:26.298 --> 1:21:27.883
It's over.

1:21:28.842 --> 1:21:29.968
What do you mean?

1:21:30.802 --> 1:21:31.720
Come in!

1:21:52.282 --> 1:21:53.116
It's you.

1:22:15.722 --> 1:22:17.974
The fate of the country in your hands.

1:22:21.436 --> 1:22:22.646
Because of you all,

1:22:24.189 --> 1:22:26.191
we won't have a night of despair.

1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:31.321
Please be sure to return safely.

1:22:32.489 --> 1:22:33.323
Let's walk...

1:22:34.783 --> 1:22:36.409
towards the morning light.

1:22:49.214 --> 1:22:50.340
How's the tea?

1:22:52.050 --> 1:22:53.885
My sister-in-law sent it to me.

1:22:55.095 --> 1:22:57.764
The Queen had some, there isn't much left.

1:23:04.813 --> 1:23:07.190
I think you have many things to tell me.

1:23:12.195 --> 1:23:13.029
Your Majesty,

1:23:15.031 --> 1:23:16.533
why are you so calm?

1:23:19.452 --> 1:23:22.205
You should arrest
and interrogate Nam Gun-hee,

1:23:22.288 --> 1:23:25.208
look for those who helped him
and punish them all.

1:23:25.625 --> 1:23:28.044
Sambo, the precious tea is getting cold.

1:23:29.587 --> 1:23:30.672
When it gets cold,

1:23:31.673 --> 1:23:33.675
it loses its fragrance.

1:23:39.639 --> 1:23:41.141
More haste, less speed.

1:23:42.183 --> 1:23:44.686
If I interrogate Nam Gun-hee
without proof,

1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:48.148
I'll declare a war with other vassals.

1:23:48.815 --> 1:23:49.858
If that happens,

1:23:50.817 --> 1:23:53.611
things would only get worse. Also--

1:23:53.695 --> 1:23:55.947
You're worried about Prince Jaseong.

1:23:59.576 --> 1:24:03.038
Finally, you know how to read my mind.

1:24:12.297 --> 1:24:15.717
Your Majesty, did you not enjoy the food?

1:24:16.134 --> 1:24:18.136
No, I'm just not hungry.

1:24:18.803 --> 1:24:19.971
Just take it away.

1:24:21.389 --> 1:24:24.059
Anyway, where's Sambo?

1:24:24.392 --> 1:24:26.770
He went to the library to grab a book.

1:24:50.418 --> 1:24:52.420
Your Majesty, it's me, Sambo.

1:25:04.474 --> 1:25:06.768
Your Majesty, it's me, Sambo.

1:25:14.359 --> 1:25:15.193
Your Majesty!

1:25:15.735 --> 1:25:16.569
Your Majesty!

1:25:17.445 --> 1:25:18.279
Your Majesty!

1:25:18.613 --> 1:25:19.447
Your Majesty!

1:25:19.864 --> 1:25:20.698
Your Majesty!

1:25:23.118 --> 1:25:24.119
Is anyone there?

1:25:25.036 --> 1:25:26.621
Call the Royal Physician!

1:25:28.248 --> 1:25:31.709
So, what is the cause?

1:25:35.839 --> 1:25:36.798
I apologize.

1:25:38.007 --> 1:25:39.843
I've never seen such symptoms.

1:25:41.344 --> 1:25:43.096
I'm not quite sure.

1:25:43.179 --> 1:25:46.266
The best physician in the country
shouldn't say that!

1:25:48.726 --> 1:25:50.520
Could it be that the traitors

1:25:50.937 --> 1:25:53.690
poisoned His Majesty's food?

1:25:54.315 --> 1:25:55.316
As you know,

1:25:55.900 --> 1:25:57.527
the Palace maids tried

1:25:57.610 --> 1:25:59.654
His Majesty's leftovers.

1:26:00.572 --> 1:26:04.284
Not one of them is showing the symptoms.

1:26:04.617 --> 1:26:05.451
Then,

1:26:06.661 --> 1:26:09.497
why is he hovering between life and death?

1:26:12.792 --> 1:26:16.004
You should never make a mistake.
Do you understand?

1:26:16.629 --> 1:26:19.674
Yes, I will try my best.

1:26:22.093 --> 1:26:25.013
You'll become a vassal of merit tomorrow.

1:26:26.723 --> 1:26:28.766
I'll make sure no one finds out.

1:26:34.939 --> 1:26:37.942
After receiving this order,
we'll gather in Hanyang.

1:26:39.819 --> 1:26:43.656
As soon as we come together,
a new world will begin.

1:26:44.616 --> 1:26:46.576
We must move quickly.

1:26:57.337 --> 1:26:58.213
A medicine?

1:26:58.296 --> 1:27:02.258
Yes. His Majesty used to take it
when he couldn't fall asleep.

1:27:02.508 --> 1:27:04.761
He's been taking them for a long time.

1:27:04.844 --> 1:27:07.055
So that medicine caused his illness?

1:27:07.138 --> 1:27:10.558
No, there's a herb that doesn't go well
with the medicine.

1:27:10.934 --> 1:27:13.478
The Palace maids may not have any problem.

1:27:14.187 --> 1:27:15.396
But for His Majesty,

1:27:16.231 --> 1:27:17.941
it would be a fatal poison.

1:27:18.024 --> 1:27:19.651
Then, what should we do?

1:27:23.738 --> 1:27:25.573
He must drink this antidote.

1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:28.660
-Will he wake up once he drinks it?
-I'm not sure.

1:27:29.744 --> 1:27:31.663
It'll take time for it to work.

1:27:43.841 --> 1:27:46.344
-I'll take him out of the Palace.
-What?

1:27:46.427 --> 1:27:49.055
They are not going to wait around.

1:27:49.138 --> 1:27:51.641
What are you going to do by yourself?

1:27:51.808 --> 1:27:55.645
The Minister of War will try
something else with His Majesty!

1:28:00.316 --> 1:28:01.734
We must act today.

1:28:21.754 --> 1:28:22.755
Stop!

1:28:34.183 --> 1:28:35.143
What's going on?

1:28:36.144 --> 1:28:39.105
The Queen Dowager asked me
to relay you a message.

1:28:40.523 --> 1:28:41.482
What is it?

1:28:41.941 --> 1:28:45.320
The Queen Dowager said
to relay the message privately.

1:28:49.324 --> 1:28:50.867
Could you leave us alone?

1:29:15.975 --> 1:29:17.560
What is this?

1:29:18.227 --> 1:29:19.187
Look closer.

1:29:24.150 --> 1:29:27.487
It has some kind of a medicine scent.

1:29:43.294 --> 1:29:44.420
Okay, hurry!

1:30:00.061 --> 1:30:02.980
Head to the temple
North to Bukhan Mountain.

1:30:03.856 --> 1:30:06.109
I'll tell Heuk-woon to follow you.

1:30:08.111 --> 1:30:09.278
Please be careful.

1:30:12.782 --> 1:30:13.825
Wait a moment.

1:30:18.079 --> 1:30:19.163
Identify yourself.

1:30:19.789 --> 1:30:21.958
Royal chronicle keeper Yoon Yi-seo.

1:30:22.250 --> 1:30:24.961
Why are you pulling a wagon at this hour?

1:30:25.044 --> 1:30:27.130
According to the feng shui,

1:30:27.588 --> 1:30:30.007
this box is bad for His Majesty's health,

1:30:30.174 --> 1:30:32.009
so I'm taking it out of here.

1:30:33.136 --> 1:30:34.345
What's inside?

1:30:34.929 --> 1:30:36.013
Nothing.

1:30:36.681 --> 1:30:37.807
It's an empty box.

1:30:38.433 --> 1:30:39.892
Open the box.

1:30:47.275 --> 1:30:48.109
Open it.

1:30:51.904 --> 1:30:52.780
Your Majesty!

1:31:17.138 --> 1:31:18.055
Satisfied?

1:31:19.557 --> 1:31:21.058
You can go.

1:31:33.863 --> 1:31:35.865
First time in 40 years of service,

1:31:36.699 --> 1:31:39.160
I have a headache like this.

1:31:39.827 --> 1:31:41.454
You're right!

1:31:43.539 --> 1:31:44.874
Tomorrow,

1:31:45.500 --> 1:31:47.543
this country will find...

1:31:48.461 --> 1:31:50.296
its place.

1:31:51.339 --> 1:31:53.841
Joseon has always belonged
to the nobility!

1:31:53.925 --> 1:31:55.843
-Of course!
-That's right.

1:31:56.469 --> 1:31:59.388
I'd like to propose a toast
to the Minister of War

1:31:59.555 --> 1:32:05.102
for his great contribution and hard work.

1:32:05.228 --> 1:32:07.730
-Sure!
-Cheers!

1:32:08.481 --> 1:32:09.857
-Let's drink!
-Yes.

1:32:38.052 --> 1:32:39.262
Your Majesty!

1:32:40.513 --> 1:32:41.347
Your Majesty!

1:32:46.310 --> 1:32:48.187
-He went this way.
-Let's go!

1:33:30.896 --> 1:33:32.356
Your Majesty!

1:33:55.338 --> 1:33:57.882
How can you be so disloyal to His Majesty?

1:33:59.216 --> 1:34:03.512
Nam Gun-hee, you'll never avoid
the judgment of history!

1:34:04.388 --> 1:34:07.475
History is written in blood.

1:34:07.975 --> 1:34:12.146
Your name will go down in history
as the one who killed the King.

1:34:14.482 --> 1:34:15.316
Catch him.

1:34:43.010 --> 1:34:44.720
Hurry up. Run!

1:35:13.666 --> 1:35:16.085
I recall a rumor I heard a few years ago.

1:35:17.253 --> 1:35:20.131
Joseon's best swordsman, Heuk-woon,

1:35:20.965 --> 1:35:23.092
tried to threaten the Prince's life.

1:35:24.802 --> 1:35:28.848
How did that person became
the escort of the Crown Prince?

1:35:29.974 --> 1:35:31.600
It's none of your business.

1:35:34.478 --> 1:35:36.564
If you had killed His Majesty then,

1:35:38.357 --> 1:35:40.651
I wouldn't have all this trouble.

1:35:41.193 --> 1:35:45.281
You won't touch a finger on His Majesty.

1:36:50.763 --> 1:36:51.597
Majesty...

1:36:53.182 --> 1:36:54.809
please open your eyes.

1:36:56.936 --> 1:36:58.270
Please wake up.

1:37:10.616 --> 1:37:11.450
Heuk-woon!

1:37:13.536 --> 1:37:14.370
Heuk-woon!

1:37:14.703 --> 1:37:16.413
Heuk-woon! Are you all right?

1:37:18.624 --> 1:37:21.794
-Take me to His Majesty.
-Please stay strong!

1:37:26.507 --> 1:37:27.424
Your Majesty...

1:37:40.855 --> 1:37:43.107
The assassin is here.

1:37:45.901 --> 1:37:47.820
Everything is over now.

1:37:48.362 --> 1:37:49.780
Put down the sword.

1:38:20.895 --> 1:38:23.355
You have guts for a scholar.

1:38:27.902 --> 1:38:28.736
That's right.

1:38:34.783 --> 1:38:36.160
Even if this body dies,

1:38:37.411 --> 1:38:39.330
my soul will live to stop you.

1:38:39.872 --> 1:38:41.332
I will show you.

1:38:42.374 --> 1:38:45.586
The weak fall prey to the strong,
who will always rule.

1:38:46.170 --> 1:38:48.505
It's the only providence in this world.

1:38:49.298 --> 1:38:50.925
You're really noisy, Sambo.

1:38:52.426 --> 1:38:53.260
Your Majesty!

1:38:59.683 --> 1:39:01.602
You guys are way too noisy.

1:39:02.186 --> 1:39:04.480
I had to wake up.

1:39:11.570 --> 1:39:14.406
It would've been better
if you stayed asleep.

1:39:14.782 --> 1:39:16.909
Will you try one last time?

1:39:19.036 --> 1:39:20.496
It's too late.

1:39:21.413 --> 1:39:24.541
Ten thousands soldiers from the North
are rushing in.

1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.461
You're dreaming with your eyes open.

1:39:37.888 --> 1:39:41.558
Before I passed out,
I sent a secret order to the North.

1:39:42.309 --> 1:39:45.145
It says that no matter
what orders they receive,

1:39:45.229 --> 1:39:47.606
if it doesn't include my fingerprint,

1:39:49.483 --> 1:39:51.902
they are not allowed to use the military.

1:39:55.030 --> 1:39:56.782
You were too busy looking up

1:39:56.865 --> 1:39:59.368
to notice the ground collapsing under you.

1:39:59.451 --> 1:40:02.538
Majesty, you've forgotten
the most important fact.

1:40:04.331 --> 1:40:07.084
There's no one here...

1:40:08.919 --> 1:40:10.170
to protect your life.

1:40:13.382 --> 1:40:14.508
What are you doing?

1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:19.263
I can't let you face this traitor's blade.

1:40:22.266 --> 1:40:23.100
Step aside.

1:40:23.559 --> 1:40:24.977
You're not his opponent.

1:40:49.460 --> 1:40:50.836
Sambo, move aside.

1:40:51.587 --> 1:40:52.713
You might get hurt.

1:41:00.721 --> 1:41:04.725
How do you think Heuk-woon got
that scar on his face?

1:41:10.439 --> 1:41:12.274
You dared to threaten my life.

1:41:12.816 --> 1:41:14.943
I'll give you a punishment.

1:41:16.779 --> 1:41:17.696
How about this?

1:41:19.323 --> 1:41:21.325
Will you devote your life to me?

1:41:21.867 --> 1:41:26.038
Have you heard any rumors about me?

1:41:26.246 --> 1:41:30.042
You won't touch a finger on His Majesty.

1:41:30.375 --> 1:41:32.711
Like I'm the best swordsman in Joseon.

1:41:35.380 --> 1:41:37.466
Why are you so quiet?

1:42:11.583 --> 1:42:13.418
You said something interesting.

1:42:14.002 --> 1:42:16.088
"The weak fall prey to the strong,

1:42:16.964 --> 1:42:18.674
who will always rule."

1:42:25.055 --> 1:42:26.515
Do you think it's true?

1:42:46.702 --> 1:42:47.536
How about it?

1:42:48.328 --> 1:42:49.163
Satisfied?

1:42:50.372 --> 1:42:53.333
Happy to get crushed
by someone stronger than you?

1:43:14.646 --> 1:43:16.190
Do you still have energy?

1:43:16.773 --> 1:43:18.567
How can this be?

1:43:21.862 --> 1:43:24.072
Why do you think Heuk-woon came here?

1:44:11.328 --> 1:44:12.162
Your Majesty!

1:44:20.420 --> 1:44:23.382
You should've made him denounce
the other traitors.

1:44:24.508 --> 1:44:26.301
Why did you kill him?

1:44:30.347 --> 1:44:31.181
Yi-seo.

1:44:33.725 --> 1:44:34.559
Let it go.

1:44:36.561 --> 1:44:37.479
This is enough.

1:44:41.108 --> 1:44:41.942
Let's go.

1:45:13.015 --> 1:45:15.142
After Nam Gun-hee and his gang died,

1:45:15.809 --> 1:45:16.977
the case was over.

1:45:20.314 --> 1:45:22.441
The Court was stabilized,

1:45:23.317 --> 1:45:26.028
and the people's livelihood
was vibrant again.

1:45:30.365 --> 1:45:33.160
Nam Gun-hee was publicly
displayed decapitated

1:45:34.619 --> 1:45:38.373
and there were no more rumors.

1:45:41.251 --> 1:45:42.669
I thought...

1:45:43.587 --> 1:45:46.340
everything was peaceful and over.

1:45:52.971 --> 1:45:55.015
Okay, you can leave now.

1:46:01.730 --> 1:46:05.817
Why did Your Majesty visit us
without an escort?

1:46:12.240 --> 1:46:16.244
After I was appointed Crown Prince,
I took these pills for ten years.

1:46:17.412 --> 1:46:19.414
You're familiar with them, right?

1:46:20.832 --> 1:46:22.667
My brother had insomnia, too.

1:46:23.627 --> 1:46:25.212
He also took these pills.

1:46:26.963 --> 1:46:31.093
So, you surely know about the herb
that doesn't go well with them.

1:46:32.427 --> 1:46:34.429
A life-threatening herbal medicine

1:46:35.097 --> 1:46:37.015
when you take with these pills.

1:46:40.644 --> 1:46:42.771
Only three people know about this.

1:46:43.146 --> 1:46:43.980
Me, Jikjehak…

1:46:44.815 --> 1:46:45.649
and you.

1:46:46.358 --> 1:46:47.192
Just us three.

1:46:50.112 --> 1:46:50.946
You may enter.

1:46:55.992 --> 1:46:58.495
Will you guarantee
Prince Jaseong's safety?

1:46:59.496 --> 1:47:00.622
Not only that,

1:47:02.207 --> 1:47:04.126
he'll also replace the King.

1:47:04.626 --> 1:47:07.295
We will put Prince Jaseong on the throne.

1:47:13.760 --> 1:47:17.305
Please allow me to kill myself
to pay for my sins.

1:47:18.348 --> 1:47:22.144
And please, take care of Prince Jaseong.

1:47:22.227 --> 1:47:25.355
He's my son, but he also is
Your Majesty's family.

1:47:25.939 --> 1:47:27.816
This is all my fault.

1:47:28.191 --> 1:47:30.152
As a mother, I thought...

1:47:30.235 --> 1:47:32.571
this was the only way to save my child.

1:47:33.738 --> 1:47:35.449
I didn't come here...

1:47:36.491 --> 1:47:38.326
to question you.

1:47:39.035 --> 1:47:42.664
I came here today
to relieve the burden in your heart.

1:47:44.833 --> 1:47:47.794
With the death of Nam Gun-hee,
the treason is over.

1:47:48.170 --> 1:47:49.004
At this point,

1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:51.882
I will not seek punishment

1:47:52.382 --> 1:47:53.341
for the events.

1:47:54.676 --> 1:47:55.552
Your Majesty.

1:47:55.927 --> 1:47:56.761
Instead,

1:48:02.809 --> 1:48:04.769
I'll fulfill my brother's wishes.

1:48:06.271 --> 1:48:07.939
Be a good mother to Jaseong,

1:48:10.692 --> 1:48:12.819
so he can become a good King.

1:48:15.322 --> 1:48:18.200
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

1:48:19.409 --> 1:48:20.452
I'll get going.

1:48:56.530 --> 1:48:57.864
Stop right there!

1:48:58.573 --> 1:48:59.491
If you scream,

1:49:00.742 --> 1:49:02.077
or move,

1:49:05.163 --> 1:49:05.997
I'll kill you.

1:49:07.374 --> 1:49:09.042
Tell us about the King.

1:49:09.751 --> 1:49:10.794
You know it all.

1:49:11.795 --> 1:49:12.629
The king is...

1:49:14.714 --> 1:49:15.882
very weird...

1:49:16.424 --> 1:49:18.510
and ill-tempered.

1:49:19.469 --> 1:49:21.012
He's out of his mind.

1:49:22.347 --> 1:49:24.057
People in the Royal Palace...

1:49:24.391 --> 1:49:25.809
Hold on.

1:49:26.393 --> 1:49:29.104
-They already...
-You, stop!

1:49:29.187 --> 1:49:31.231
Never mind. Stop it.

1:49:32.607 --> 1:49:33.858
Seriously?

1:49:38.154 --> 1:49:39.781
You didn't practice, right?

1:49:42.075 --> 1:49:44.077
-I tried...
-I'll kill you.

1:49:52.043 --> 1:49:53.128
There's no choice.

1:49:54.337 --> 1:49:55.964
You'll do it one more year.

1:49:56.923 --> 1:49:57.757
Pardon me?

1:50:01.845 --> 1:50:02.887
Majesty!

1:50:02.971 --> 1:50:04.180
Your Majesty!

1:50:05.265 --> 1:50:06.850
Do you want me again?

1:50:07.350 --> 1:50:10.228
This is not what you promised.

1:50:10.312 --> 1:50:11.813
Just once more.

1:50:11.896 --> 1:50:14.816
-I don't want to train another newbie.
-Majesty...

1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:18.945
-Follow me, Sambo!
-Your Majesty!

1:53:50.698 --> 1:53:52.951
