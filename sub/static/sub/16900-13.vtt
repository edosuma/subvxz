00:01.460 --> 00:04.630
No, Jack, I'm not blaming you
but everybody got food poisoning.

00:04.796 --> 00:07.090
Food poisoning?
That isn't possible.

00:07.257 --> 00:10.427
That seafood was a gift from my friend,
the owner of the Cleveland Browns.

00:10.594 --> 00:15.849
They're very expensive freshwater clams
from the Cuyahoga River.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.601
My whole staff has been blorching

00:17.768 --> 00:19.603
for three days, so if there's any way

00:19.770 --> 00:21.021
that we could show a rerun--

00:21.188 --> 00:23.941
I wish I could help you, Lemon,
but I've already sold the ad time to the army.

00:24.106 --> 00:28.070
Now, do the best you can,
I need a live show from you in two days.

00:28.234 --> 00:29.270
Uh, no, no, no, no.

00:29.444 --> 00:31.075
That's not for you.
Bianca's coming.

00:31.242 --> 00:33.614
Crazy Bianca is coming here?

00:33.789 --> 00:37.200
You make me wanna vomit.

00:37.577 --> 00:38.582
Why?

00:38.745 --> 00:39.703
Because she wants something.

00:39.877 --> 00:43.373
She only contacts me when she wants something,
and she's bringing her lawyer.

00:43.546 --> 00:47.501
Which means she's gonna try to bleed something else
out of me in our divorce proceedings.

00:47.678 --> 00:49.211
You're not all the way divorced?

00:49.388 --> 00:51.420
Well, we've been legally separated since 1989.

00:51.595 --> 00:52.551
It's been a nightmare, Lemon.

00:52.716 --> 00:55.760
I mean, one minute you're newlyweds
making love on the floor of the Concorde,

00:55.935 --> 01:00.261
and the next your lawyers are fighting
over who gets to keep the box your dog defecates in.

01:00.438 --> 01:01.971
You taught your dog to poop in a box?

01:02.146 --> 01:03.603
Bianca did, but I want that box.

01:03.776 --> 01:04.769
Ugh.

01:04.947 --> 01:08.112
It's gonna take all day and into the night
to deal with that crazy woman.

01:08.278 --> 01:11.110
Fighting, conniving,
clawing at each other.

01:11.287 --> 01:12.992
Are you angry or excited right now?

01:13.155 --> 01:14.071
I can't tell.

01:14.247 --> 01:18.451
Mrs. Donaghy and her lawyer are here.

01:19.457 --> 01:23.751
I'm sorry, Johnny.
I'm a little early.

01:29.676 --> 01:33.461
This would work on Ugly Betty.

01:52.736 --> 01:54.782
Hey, guys.

01:54.946 --> 01:59.030
I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to work
all night tonight till we get caught up.

01:59.208 --> 02:00.783
What? Liz...

02:00.958 --> 02:04.240
I can't believe you're gonna make us work
all night on Valentine's Day.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.542
Is it Valentine's Day?

02:05.707 --> 02:06.961
Oh, I totally forgot.

02:07.126 --> 02:08.293
Hells, yes, Liz Lemon.

02:08.466 --> 02:09.370
And I had plans.

02:09.545 --> 02:14.300
Me and Angie rented the penthouse
at the SoHo Grand where we will drink wine
and pleasure each other.

02:14.465 --> 02:15.343
Gross.

02:15.516 --> 02:18.432
When you been married 17 years,
you have to keep it spicy.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.553
That's why me and my wife role-play.

02:20.726 --> 02:23.392
She put on a Girl Scout outfit
with a box of cookies,

02:23.567 --> 02:25.312
and I answer the door in my boxers.

02:25.476 --> 02:29.023
Or I rent out a wheelchair,
and she pretends to be my caseworker.

02:29.197 --> 02:30.650
And in a way, she is.

02:30.817 --> 02:31.770
Well, what about me?

02:31.948 --> 02:35.613
I just took a whole bunch of Cialis
'cause I have big Valentine's plans tonight.

02:35.785 --> 02:36.532
With who?

02:36.697 --> 02:37.950
Uh, nobody.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.702
Okay, you know, I'm sorry, you guys,
but we have to get this done.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.742
Let's order some dinner.

02:43.917 --> 02:46.332
Cerie, do you mind working late
on Valentine's Day?

02:46.508 --> 02:47.910
No, I don't care.

02:48.086 --> 02:49.872
Aris and I are in a huge fight anyway.

02:50.046 --> 02:52.633
Well--Aris? Is that your fiancé, Aris?

02:52.795 --> 02:56.002
Yeah, he keeps sending me
all these flowers to apologize,

02:56.177 --> 02:59.131
but he's still insisting on having
a Greek Orthodox wedding,

02:59.308 --> 03:02.761
but I really disagree
with the church's stance on Cyprus.

03:02.937 --> 03:05.601
Mm, so, um, Chinese?
Or not?

03:05.766 --> 03:07.223
Liz, these are actually for you.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.393
Who are they from?

03:08.568 --> 03:12.311
I don't know, it doesn't say.

03:12.607 --> 03:15.523
Secret admirer!

03:20.156 --> 03:22.071
Too bad you gotta work all night!

03:22.248 --> 03:24.622
Johnny, thank you for speaking
to me in person.

03:24.786 --> 03:26.873
If this is about the dog box,
I'm not giving in.

03:27.047 --> 03:28.662
Oh, no, Johnny.

03:28.837 --> 03:34.253
I feel so terrible for what happened
at Gerhardt's party.

03:36.097 --> 03:38.011
Really? I had a fabulous time at that party.

03:38.178 --> 03:40.380
I want our divorce to be final.

03:40.555 --> 03:43.141
All right.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.310
I want back all the jewelry
I ever bought you.

03:46.478 --> 03:47.062
Fine.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.812
I want the art supplies
that I gave you on your 40th birthday

03:49.985 --> 03:52.100
and any subsequent art projects
you made with them.

03:52.275 --> 03:52.851
Fine.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.061
I want all of our love letters.

03:54.238 --> 03:55.152
Fine.

03:55.317 --> 03:57.522
I want all of your parents' love letters.

03:57.695 --> 03:58.151
Fine.

03:58.326 --> 04:01.151
I want full stake in the Arby's franchise
we bought outside of Telluride.

04:01.328 --> 04:05.870
Oh, damn it, Johnny, you know I love
my big beef and cheddar.

04:06.036 --> 04:07.661
Take it all.

04:07.837 --> 04:12.043
Take the Arby's, take the house in Amagansett,
take the Otto Dix paintings.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.252
I don't care anymore.
I wanna move on.

04:14.427 --> 04:17.130
Mrs. Donaghy intends to relinquish
all communal property.

04:17.297 --> 04:21.130
We should have the papers for you
to sign tomorrow.

04:21.307 --> 04:22.843
Then I suppose we're done.

04:23.017 --> 04:25.680
We're done.

04:34.447 --> 04:37.732
Break out a bottle of champagne,
but not the one that came with the shellfish.

04:37.907 --> 04:41.991
Get some other bottle of champagne.

04:42.326 --> 04:42.782
Hey.

04:42.958 --> 04:43.742
Hey.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.910
Did you send me these to be nice?

04:46.078 --> 04:46.992
Why would I send you flowers?

04:47.166 --> 04:48.833
Because it's Valentine's Day--

04:48.998 --> 04:50.242
Oh, no! It's what?

04:50.416 --> 04:51.831
It's Valentine's Day?

04:52.005 --> 04:53.582
Again?

04:53.757 --> 04:55.173
Oh, did you blow it with your wife?

04:55.338 --> 04:56.922
It's too late,
it's too late, I blew it.

04:57.087 --> 04:58.962
Well, who cares, you know,
it's just Valentine's Day.

04:59.135 --> 05:00.553
It's also her birthday.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.882
Ah.

05:03.308 --> 05:05.552
Oh, I got the turkey club.

05:05.727 --> 05:06.432
Hey.

05:06.597 --> 05:07.592
Hey, what's up?

05:07.765 --> 05:10.722
Did you just come from a Suzanne Somers
look-alike contest?

05:10.897 --> 05:12.142
Hilarious, Frank.

05:12.318 --> 05:15.143
Actually, I just came from
performing at Vagina Day.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.981
Is that an off-shoot
of The Vagina Monologues?

05:18.158 --> 05:20.440
No, we are in no way affiliated
with The Vagina Monologues.

05:20.617 --> 05:21.941
Vagina Day is a charity event

05:22.117 --> 05:23.283
founded by a group of celebrities

05:23.446 --> 05:25.452
who have, for whatever reason, never been asked

05:25.616 --> 05:27.533
to participate in The Vagina Monologues.

05:27.708 --> 05:31.540
Every February 14, we improvise monologues
about our lady parts for the homeless.

05:31.707 --> 05:32.952
Oh, to benefit the homeless?

05:33.126 --> 05:36.211
No, just for them.

05:37.296 --> 05:38.832
My vagina is a flower.

05:39.008 --> 05:40.882
A weird ugly flower.

05:41.048 --> 05:43.381
I remember the night
I lost my virginity.

05:43.555 --> 05:48.303
It was 1968,
during the Democratic Convention.

05:48.728 --> 05:49.641
Lemon, it's done.

05:49.806 --> 05:50.393
What's done?

05:50.557 --> 05:52.973
My divorce, it's final.

05:53.148 --> 05:55.103
[laughter] Mwah!

05:55.278 --> 05:56.350
I'm divorced, everyone!

05:56.528 --> 05:57.641
Who wants to grab a drink?

05:57.817 --> 05:59.062
Yeah, I really can't, Jack.

05:59.238 --> 06:00.940
You're making us work all night, remember?

06:01.116 --> 06:02.323
Oh.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.902
Hey, did you send me these
because you feel bad?

06:05.078 --> 06:08.453
I did not and I do not.

06:09.498 --> 06:11.161
Hey, Pete, you up
for a quick cocktail?

06:11.336 --> 06:12.992
Sorry, I gotta duck out,
I just found a Hallmark store

06:13.168 --> 06:15.083
open 70 blocks from here!

06:15.258 --> 06:17.330
Oh, Tracy, what do you say?

06:17.608 --> 06:18.790
A quick drink to celebrate my freedom?

06:18.964 --> 06:22.250
Aw, Jackie D.,
any other time, but I made plans
with my wife tonight.

06:22.424 --> 06:23.635
Just one quick one.

06:23.802 --> 06:25.264
This is the best night of my life!

06:25.429 --> 06:27.170
All right-- just one!

06:27.348 --> 06:29.800
I gotta be downtown dressed
as a ninja by 10:00.

06:29.978 --> 06:32.511
Let's go.

06:33.067 --> 06:35.563
Hey, Frank, marry, boff, kill.

06:35.726 --> 06:38.813
Beyoncé, Paula Abdul, and Oprah.

06:38.986 --> 06:40.060
Dude, that's beyond easy.

06:40.237 --> 06:43.233
Boff Beyoncé, kill Paula, marry Oprah.

06:43.408 --> 06:45.532
Okay, marry, boff, kill.

06:45.698 --> 06:47.900
Cerie, Liz, and Jenna.

06:48.078 --> 06:49.072
Once again, no-brainer.

06:49.246 --> 06:51.990
Marry Liz, get with Cerie, kill Jenna.

06:52.167 --> 06:53.581
I can hear you!

06:53.746 --> 06:54.662
(Liz) Frank, knock it off.

06:54.838 --> 06:56.703
Don't play that game about people
who are in the room.

06:56.877 --> 06:57.582
Why not?

06:57.755 --> 07:00.923
Because it always starts out fun
and then it gets weird.

07:01.086 --> 07:04.960
But thank you for saying
that you would marry me.

07:05.138 --> 07:06.380
You didn't send me these, right?

07:06.558 --> 07:09.930
No. Are you kidding me?

07:10.097 --> 07:14.051
Hi, um, my name is Liz Lemon,
and I received flowers from your shop tonight.

07:14.226 --> 07:17.471
And I can't tell who they're from.

07:17.645 --> 07:21.733
No, no, I did read the card,
but it's not signed.

07:21.906 --> 07:26.440
No, I'm not with so many men
that it's impossible for me to guess.

07:26.617 --> 07:29.570
Well, that is just--
oh, oh, well, you know what?

07:29.748 --> 07:31.822
I found the card, actually,
they're from your mom.

07:31.997 --> 07:36.450
Yeah, so tell your gay mom
I said thanks.

07:38.916 --> 07:42.173
We gotta order some more champagne,
go and jump on my helicopter,

07:42.336 --> 07:45.842
and buzz Trump Tower until Don comes out
on the roof and begs us to stop.

07:46.005 --> 07:48.382
Yeah, sounds good!

07:48.556 --> 07:52.430
I just gotta call my wife,
let her know I'm gonna be late.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.803
Hey, Angie, listen, I'm gonna be--

07:54.976 --> 07:56.222
Right.

07:56.395 --> 07:57.311
I have to go.

07:57.478 --> 07:58.682
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:58.857 --> 08:01.892
That is the weak married man
inside you talking.

08:02.067 --> 08:03.022
I used to be like you.

08:03.197 --> 08:08.030
Always remember, marriage is a competition,
and after 18 years of overtime,

08:08.195 --> 08:11.491
I am finally going to claim victory!

08:11.658 --> 08:13.242
You live it up, J.D.

08:13.416 --> 08:17.240
You know where to find me
if you need me.

08:17.416 --> 08:18.742
Okay, I got a hard one.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.870
Osama bin Laden, Martha Stewart, Jenna.

08:23.045 --> 08:26.631
Bone Osama bin Laden, it'd shame him,
and then his own people would murder him.

08:26.795 --> 08:30.092
Marry Martha Stewart 'cause, you know,
she seems like a dirty bird.

08:30.268 --> 08:31.921
And kill Jenna.

08:32.097 --> 08:35.142
Cerie, marry, boff, kill.

08:35.304 --> 08:38.812
Lutz, Toofer, or Kenneth.

08:40.976 --> 08:43.520
I'd marry Toofer
'cause he's classy.

08:43.698 --> 08:46.482
I'd kill Lutz. Sorry, Lutz.

08:46.657 --> 08:48.903
The thought that you would do
anything to me is awesome.

08:49.078 --> 08:49.982
And I'd boff Kenneth.

08:50.158 --> 08:51.241
What?

08:51.407 --> 08:52.613
Really?

08:52.786 --> 08:54.113
Okay, what's your problem with me?

08:54.287 --> 08:54.860
What?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.201
You're always making rudeomments.

08:56.377 --> 08:57.323
You never wanna work with me.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.660
Why don't you like me?

08:58.838 --> 08:59.873
'Cause you're a big phony.

09:00.045 --> 09:00.492
What?

09:00.666 --> 09:01.952
Everything about you is fake.

09:02.128 --> 09:03.961
Your tan's fake, your hair's fake.

09:04.128 --> 09:05.123
Not the front!

09:05.296 --> 09:09.380
You've never done or said anything real or genuine
the whole time I've known you.

09:09.557 --> 09:10.213
Oh, really?

09:10.388 --> 09:12.763
And does a phony bare her soul
for the homeless?

09:12.928 --> 09:15.092
Because that comes from in here.

09:15.266 --> 09:17.093
My vagina is a convenience store.

09:17.267 --> 09:18.392
Clean and reliable.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.683
And closed on Christmas.

09:20.856 --> 09:23.430
Fake...and weird.

09:23.607 --> 09:28.521
Now I would like to propose a toast to my ex-wife
who tomorrow I'm going to be saying good-bye to

09:28.698 --> 09:30.271
for the very last time.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.650
(women) Aww.

09:31.825 --> 09:32.732
No, no. No, no, no.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.533
She is very, very mentally sick.

09:35.708 --> 09:40.082
I mean, if you met her, you might think
she's wonderful, but believe me,

09:40.247 --> 09:43.453
she is the succubus from the bowels of hell.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.501
I mean, if I were forced to remember her

09:45.667 --> 09:48.040
as I first met her,
when I first fell in love with her,

09:48.218 --> 09:50.671
then, yes, I-I, you know,
suppose empirically

09:50.845 --> 09:54.171
she is very, very beautiful, but, uh...

09:54.345 --> 09:59.930
But it's what's inside her
that really makes her disgusting.

10:00.555 --> 10:03.391
I wish I could touch her boobs again.

10:03.568 --> 10:05.932
She really had a fabulous pair of boobs.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.272
Ah.

10:09.156 --> 10:11.190
I admit...

10:11.368 --> 10:15.690
Sometimes I would fantasize about her getting
various terminal illnesses, and...

10:15.867 --> 10:19.780
I would nurse her.
To her death.

10:20.828 --> 10:25.750
And she would say, "Johnny,
I'm in so much pain!"

10:26.628 --> 10:32.343
And I would say, "Just hang in there
a little longer, Bianca."

10:32.508 --> 10:34.250
Love.

10:34.427 --> 10:37.013
They say that lightning never strikes twice.

10:37.176 --> 10:40.052
But I know that I will love again.

10:40.226 --> 10:45.393
And I'm never gonna be happy
until I find that woman.

10:47.278 --> 10:50.981
I think what
I'm saying to you is...

10:51.155 --> 10:54.781
what are you doing tonight?

10:56.078 --> 10:58.322
Shh.

11:01.625 --> 11:02.781
[whispering] Kenneth.

11:02.958 --> 11:04.033
This is your chance.

11:04.207 --> 11:07.121
Cerie digs you.

11:09.045 --> 11:09.751
Excuse me?

11:09.925 --> 11:11.691
And she's upset with her fiancé.

11:11.968 --> 11:14.131
Cerie said she would do it with you.

11:14.297 --> 11:16.633
Well, that just makes me perspire.

11:16.806 --> 11:22.391
In fact, I think we need you and Cerie
to go on a candy run.

11:22.555 --> 11:24.143
Okay.

11:24.307 --> 11:24.853
[quietly] But I need to--

11:25.017 --> 11:26.311
(Lutz) She can't go by herself.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.981
It's 1:00 in the morning.

11:41.115 --> 11:41.992
Can I help you?

11:42.168 --> 11:42.781
Yes, sir.

11:42.957 --> 11:45.623
We have reports of a nitrogen leak
 on this floor.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.910
Oh, no, our room is fine.

11:47.087 --> 11:48.202
I mean, we don't smell it.

11:48.377 --> 11:50.122
Oh, it's odorless, sir.

11:50.297 --> 11:52.503
I really need to check this room.

11:52.678 --> 11:53.500
Well, could you hurry up?

11:53.676 --> 11:56.132
Because my wife and I are planning
a really special night tonight.

11:56.306 --> 11:58.300
Oh, it's for your own safety, sir.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.223
Mm.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.553
I'm detecting a lot of heat over here.

12:02.728 --> 12:03.930
Is it dangerous?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.353
I don't know.

12:05.515 --> 12:08.142
I think it's coming...

12:08.316 --> 12:10.233
from my butt.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.103
Oh, no, I'm married!

12:12.275 --> 12:13.403
That's how I like 'em.

12:13.568 --> 12:14.153
Ah!

12:14.316 --> 12:17.862
What? Oh! Role-play, baby!

12:18.075 --> 12:19.571
Give it to me, baby!

12:19.747 --> 12:22.531
Oh, oh, yeah.

12:24.915 --> 12:25.662
Okay.

12:25.827 --> 12:29.581
I don't know who that is, but we done
'cause I'm not velcro-ing up again.

12:29.756 --> 12:31.871
Just be cool.
Just be...be cool.

12:32.046 --> 12:33.080
Hold on tight.

12:33.257 --> 12:35.130
Who is it?

12:35.295 --> 12:36.671
Oh, Tracy.

12:36.848 --> 12:38.422
We couldn't find a hotel room anywhere.

12:38.595 --> 12:39.840
The whole city is booked.

12:40.015 --> 12:43.223
We were hoping we could come here
and party with you.

12:43.385 --> 12:47.553
[heavily accented] Happy Valentimes!

12:53.066 --> 12:56.233
Baby, I'm sorry.
But he's going through some stuff.

12:56.405 --> 12:57.650
Angie, do you like champagne?

12:57.815 --> 12:59.531
No, it gives me a headache.

12:59.695 --> 13:01.320
This is a Krug Clos de Mesnil.

13:01.496 --> 13:03.490
I was saving it for a special occasion.

13:03.655 --> 13:06.491
And I thought to myself,
my God, this is it, am I right?

13:06.666 --> 13:07.950
Good news, good friends.

13:08.127 --> 13:10.701
I clean this too,
or, uh, just the sex?

13:10.876 --> 13:11.662
Isn't she precious?

13:11.835 --> 13:13.410
Hey, fun fact about Vlem,

13:13.588 --> 13:15.671
she originally came here
to study engineering.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.673
Come on, doll.

13:18.885 --> 13:23.841
You tell GE light bulb man
I want Sophie's Choice out of my suite!

13:24.018 --> 13:26.300
Babe!

13:33.938 --> 13:36.312
Lemon!

13:43.906 --> 13:44.862
Are you coming?

13:45.035 --> 13:46.202
Let's stall for a minute.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.911
It's so boring up there anyway.

13:49.076 --> 13:52.490
You know, Aris is just so immature sometimes.

13:52.666 --> 13:53.951
That's why I like you, Kenneth.

13:54.128 --> 13:55.330
You're an old soul.

13:55.507 --> 13:56.500
Thank you.

13:56.677 --> 13:58.133
My momma thinks so too.

13:58.298 --> 14:01.882
In fact, she's pretty sure
I'm the reincarnated soul of Adren Twyford.

14:02.056 --> 14:05.010
He was our town minister
who died in an organ fire.

14:05.177 --> 14:05.630
[beeping] Ugh.

14:05.806 --> 14:10.682
He keeps texting me to meet him downtown
at his club, even though he knows I'm working.

14:10.856 --> 14:13.351
Well, it's like Dr. Laura Schlessinger says,

14:13.526 --> 14:17.642
"Women should be more accommodating to their men
for the health of the marriage."

14:17.817 --> 14:19.153
She sounds smart.

14:19.318 --> 14:20.772
Is she really a doctor?

14:20.946 --> 14:23.441
No, I think she's kinda like Dr. Pepper.

14:23.617 --> 14:24.320
Well.

14:24.486 --> 14:26.862
I'm gonna go meet him downtown then.

14:27.038 --> 14:28.072
Thanks, Kenneth.

14:28.247 --> 14:31.911
You give really good advice.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.411
Kenneth.

14:35.626 --> 14:38.082
What? How dare you?

14:38.257 --> 14:40.333
You're so weird.

14:40.508 --> 14:41.792
Tell Liz I left, okay?

14:41.965 --> 14:42.591
All right.

14:42.798 --> 14:50.012
Oh, and if you wanna tell those guys upstairs
that we made out, it's all right with me.

15:05.908 --> 15:06.781
Ooh, video games.

15:06.947 --> 15:10.490
We could play video games.

15:11.957 --> 15:16.701
This is the second-worst
Valentine's Day we ever had.

15:16.878 --> 15:20.080
Hi, is Mr. Donaghy here?

15:20.255 --> 15:23.253
Another prostitute?

15:23.428 --> 15:24.923
Lemon, what do you say?

15:25.096 --> 15:26.962
You and me, Atlantic City.

15:27.136 --> 15:29.802
We can be in the crepe line
at The Borgata by dawn.

15:29.978 --> 15:30.932
No, Jack.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.222
What are you doing?

15:35.358 --> 15:37.023
I'm celebrating.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.733
I want Bianca to see that I'm moving on.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.693
Well then maybe you should call
Bianca to help you carry

15:41.857 --> 15:45.190
your prostitute out of the hotel
you were just ejected from.

15:45.367 --> 15:45.773
You think I should?

15:45.946 --> 15:47.862
She'd probably come right down here.

15:48.037 --> 15:48.943
You two are sick!

15:49.118 --> 15:50.823
This relationship is sick!

15:50.995 --> 15:53.243
You just don't understand,
it's complicated!

15:53.416 --> 15:54.622
No, I don't understand!

15:54.785 --> 15:55.833
Let me ask you a question.

15:55.995 --> 15:58.202
Marry, boff, kill. Bianca.

15:58.378 --> 16:00.160
Which do you wanna do?

16:00.337 --> 16:02.831
All of them.

16:03.006 --> 16:05.000
All of them.

16:05.178 --> 16:08.880
You've gotta get out of each other's lives,
Jack, or you wilnever be happy.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.631
Between the two of you,
you are 100 years old,

16:11.806 --> 16:15.721
and this is not a dignified way
for a 100-year-old couple to behave.

16:15.898 --> 16:17.262
I know.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.643
I know.

16:19.817 --> 16:22.063
Uh, oh, leave her there.

16:22.238 --> 16:24.860
It's nicer than where I found her.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.111
Come on.

16:27.276 --> 16:30.280
Happy Valentimes!

16:30.787 --> 16:31.780
You know what, friend?

16:31.955 --> 16:33.782
You got a loof nerve,
calling me a fake.

16:33.956 --> 16:36.912
You wear your thrift store T-shirts
and your big weird glasses,

16:37.088 --> 16:39.201
and everybody says,
"Oh, look at Frank, he's so cool.

16:39.376 --> 16:41.960
He has a hat that says Extra Cheese."

16:42.127 --> 16:44.212
What does that even mean?

16:44.375 --> 16:46.881
It's pretty self-explanatory.

16:47.047 --> 16:51.840
Admit it, you spend just as much time and energy
trying to look weird as I do trying to look beautiful.

16:52.018 --> 16:55.093
And you can act like you hate me,
but if I tried to kiss you right now,

16:55.268 --> 16:56.261
you would totally do it.

16:56.437 --> 17:00.312
'Cause you're a big phony jerk!

17:03.817 --> 17:07.310
And I just wanted to tell you that.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.859
Okay, fine!

17:09.025 --> 17:09.819
I pooted.

17:09.987 --> 17:10.731
It's 3:00 in the morning.

17:10.906 --> 17:11.942
Are you happy?

17:12.116 --> 17:15.821
Yeah, I'm happy, because that's the first time
you've ever done something like a real person.

17:15.996 --> 17:17.371
It's pretty cool.

17:17.538 --> 17:22.290
I-I could do it again,
but I wouldn't wanna show off.

17:22.455 --> 17:24.502
Jenna.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.079
I'm sorry I said I would kill you.

17:26.256 --> 17:28.841
Thank you.

17:29.558 --> 17:31.460
Snacks!

17:31.638 --> 17:32.260
What happened?

17:32.427 --> 17:33.303
So? Tell us?

17:33.478 --> 17:35.591
None of your beeswax.

17:35.766 --> 17:36.513
He blew it.

17:36.688 --> 17:37.802
Way to go, loser.

17:37.976 --> 17:38.680
Oh, yeah?

17:38.858 --> 17:43.730
If I blew it,
then how did I get her underpants?

17:51.115 --> 17:54.953
Just this last one, and then your marriage
is officially dissolved.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.161
It's almost like it never happened.

17:57.328 --> 18:02.330
I wouldn't be surprised if that five-inch scar
across my abdomen was suddenly gone.

18:02.497 --> 18:04.582
Johnny.

18:04.758 --> 18:06.920
Promise me you won't sell the Arby's.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.630
No, I won't.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.341
I'm gonna shut it down.

18:10.505 --> 18:11.843
Leave it vacant.

18:12.005 --> 18:14.262
Open the windows
and let nature have at it.

18:14.425 --> 18:16.512
This is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

18:16.685 --> 18:19.302
That's prime property on Highway 145.

18:19.477 --> 18:21.563
Yes, there's not a thing
you can do about it.

18:21.726 --> 18:24.141
But it is irresponsible to the community.

18:24.316 --> 18:25.141
They should sue you.

18:25.316 --> 18:26.272
I hope they do.

18:26.448 --> 18:27.602
Oh, I'll see to it.

18:27.776 --> 18:31.230
I'll go right to the
Telluride Chamber of Commerce.

18:31.408 --> 18:32.150
Do it.

18:32.327 --> 18:33.943
The case could be in court for months.

18:34.118 --> 18:36.571
Maybe years.

18:36.746 --> 18:39.700
Damn it, Johnny!

19:00.767 --> 19:02.222
Whoops. Hello.

19:02.398 --> 19:03.930
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?

19:04.106 --> 19:05.561
Hey, that's cool?

19:05.726 --> 19:07.522
Is that a French Planet of the Apes poster?

19:07.687 --> 19:09.233
- Yeah.
- Wow.

19:09.397 --> 19:12.110
You know, I've heard that in Greece
they have to change Charlton Heston's name

19:12.277 --> 19:14.481
on movie posters to Charlton Easton.

19:14.657 --> 19:17.610
Because in Greek the word "Heston" means
to poop yourself.

19:17.785 --> 19:18.991
I'm sorry, do I know you?

19:19.156 --> 19:20.321
No, I don't think so.

19:20.496 --> 19:21.491
Uh, you're Liz Lemon, right?

19:21.666 --> 19:22.870
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:23.037 --> 19:28.410
Uh, this is super awkward, but did you get
two dozen pink roses last night?

19:28.586 --> 19:30.003
Yep, there they are.

19:30.175 --> 19:31.080
Those are from you?

19:31.257 --> 19:32.383
Yes.

19:32.546 --> 19:33.790
Uh, I work up in legal, and--

19:33.967 --> 19:34.882
You're a lawyer?

19:35.056 --> 19:38.301
I prefer law stylist.

19:38.845 --> 19:43.351
Uh, anyway, I meant to send these to my girlfriend,
Liz Lemler, who works in accounting.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.262
[softly] Oh.

19:44.437 --> 19:45.222
Yeah.

19:45.398 --> 19:47.890
There's actually supposed to be a box
of chocolate-covered cherries with this, did you--

19:48.065 --> 19:49.691
I don't know anything about that.

19:49.858 --> 19:51.140
Fair enough.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.772
She pouted all night
because she thought I forgot to send her something.

19:53.946 --> 19:56.192
I told her I did,
but she didn't believe me.

19:56.367 --> 19:59.363
She sounds great.

20:00.205 --> 20:02.491
Yeah, she is.

20:02.665 --> 20:05.162
Well...good for you.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.832
Here you go.

20:06.996 --> 20:07.870
Sorry about the mix up.

20:08.048 --> 20:08.912
N-no, no!

20:09.088 --> 20:12.292
They were delivered to you,
they're yours now.

20:12.465 --> 20:12.921
Thank you.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.460
You're welcome.

20:14.635 --> 20:16.922
But could I possibly get a photo?

20:17.098 --> 20:18.382
Of you with the flowers?

20:18.558 --> 20:19.593
Like with your ID?

20:19.767 --> 20:20.631
Oh, okay.

20:20.805 --> 20:21.553
Is that all right?

20:21.726 --> 20:25.142
You know, just as proof.

20:26.767 --> 20:27.640
All right.

20:27.817 --> 20:30.520
There we go.

20:31.486 --> 20:33.231
Aw, that's a cute one.

20:33.408 --> 20:35.811
Thanks.

20:37.826 --> 20:40.943
Sorry to bother you.

20:41.117 --> 20:44.451
Happy Valentine's Day.

20:55.965 --> 20:58.962
Happy Valentimes!
