01:08.157 --> 01:10.157
Come on.

01:14.330 --> 01:16.678
Look out girls, here we go.

01:16.778 --> 01:18.596
Look to the left.

01:18.696 --> 01:20.056
Paddle.

01:20.156 --> 01:22.546
Can you see her?
- Mummy.

01:31.345 --> 01:33.345
Come on.

01:34.598 --> 01:36.598
Hold on.

01:52.657 --> 01:54.657
Christ.

01:56.201 --> 01:58.201
Yes.

02:01.081 --> 02:02.428
Mummy.
- Hi, guys.

02:02.528 --> 02:04.972
Oh, Jessie. Yeah.

02:05.072 --> 02:07.072
That was amazing.

02:09.922 --> 02:13.939
Oh, you girls were screaming.
- All right, Jessie?

02:14.039 --> 02:18.519
That wasn't so bad, was it?
- No, it was a piece of piss.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.389
Whoo.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.230
Bitch.

02:33.694 --> 02:36.293
Bit more, bit more.
- Go on, Paul. Fish her out.

02:36.393 --> 02:37.794
There. Got you.

02:37.894 --> 02:39.894
You all right?
- Yeah.

02:41.535 --> 02:44.437
It's freezing. I can't feel my fingers.

02:44.537 --> 02:46.537
Heave.

02:48.249 --> 02:49.805
Jessie, Jessie.

02:49.905 --> 02:52.586
Ah, come here. Oh, babe.

02:57.341 --> 03:01.021
It was just amazing.
Would you like to do that?

03:01.803 --> 03:04.485
Come on, Jessie, it's freezing.
Let's go back to the car.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.070
Go with your Daddy....

03:06.170 --> 03:08.197
I'll just help the girls.
- All right.

03:08.297 --> 03:10.449
It's OK, you go on. We
can finish up here.

03:10.549 --> 03:12.951
You sure? Thanks, guys.
I'll see you at the hotel.

03:13.051 --> 03:15.051
See you.

03:27.202 --> 03:29.341
Jess, shall I phone Rachel's mum?

03:29.441 --> 03:32.261
See if Rachel wants
to come to dinner on Thursday?

03:32.361 --> 03:34.361
Yeah? OK.

03:34.404 --> 03:35.719
When she comes round,

03:35.819 --> 03:38.433
she can help us plan
your birthday party.

03:38.533 --> 03:41.973
Are you going to invite
any boys this time?

03:46.594 --> 03:49.394
Are you OK? You
seem a bit distant.

03:49.639 --> 03:51.639
I'm fine.

05:05.250 --> 05:07.250
Jess?

05:14.091 --> 05:16.091
Jessie.

05:40.032 --> 05:42.032
Jessie.

05:42.617 --> 05:45.800
Sh, sh. I'm sorry. She's gone.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.552
I'm sorry.
- No.

05:48.652 --> 05:49.928
No, no.

05:50.028 --> 05:52.180
No, no, no.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.837
She's gone, Sarah. Shh.

05:55.921 --> 05:58.006
Shh.

07:05.777 --> 07:08.876
Well, it's mud, blood and beer...

07:08.976 --> 07:11.253
or sweet Jesus.

07:11.353 --> 07:13.513
Great. Turn that shite off.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.960
That's frightening.

07:26.963 --> 07:30.403
Listen, we don't have
to do this, you know.

07:31.092 --> 07:33.812
We can head back
and stay in town.

07:34.386 --> 07:36.866
Get wasted, go to a barn dance.

07:38.140 --> 07:40.140
Now that is frightening.

07:45.146 --> 07:47.722
You're right, we
don't have to do this.

07:47.822 --> 07:50.802
But I'm not going to be
the one to tell Juno.

07:50.902 --> 07:52.214
She's a piece of work, man.

07:52.314 --> 07:54.584
She always brings us out
into the middle of...

07:54.684 --> 07:56.127
Well, look at it.

07:56.227 --> 08:01.267
She came to Scotland last year.
- Yeah, and left pretty quickly.

08:38.028 --> 08:40.028
Sarah. Beth.

08:40.947 --> 08:42.628
Juno.

08:42.727 --> 08:44.784
You look fantastic.

08:47.078 --> 08:49.301
Ah, come here. Oh.

08:49.401 --> 08:51.512
Let me look at you. Wow.

08:51.612 --> 08:53.388
Everything is going to be fine.

08:53.488 --> 08:55.098
Better. It's going to be great.

08:55.198 --> 08:56.880
Becca and Sam can't
wait to see you.

08:56.980 --> 08:57.892
Why don't you go in?

08:57.992 --> 09:00.228
Give me these.
- Yeah.

09:00.328 --> 09:01.312
Thanks.

09:01.412 --> 09:03.635
OK?
- Yeah, OK.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.527
Ooh, very nice....

09:08.627 --> 09:11.434
How is she?
- Well, she's here.

09:12.226 --> 09:14.226
One step at a time, eh?

09:15.020 --> 09:15.670
Hey, hey, hey.

09:15.770 --> 09:17.619
Who are you calling
a fucking cheater?

09:17.719 --> 09:19.370
I'm calling you a fucking cheater.

09:19.470 --> 09:21.205
Hello.

09:21.305 --> 09:23.305
Hey.

09:23.528 --> 09:25.528
Hello.

09:26.448 --> 09:29.088
You do look really good.
- Oh, you look amazing.

09:29.188 --> 09:31.668
Hey.
- Let me put the bags down.

09:35.206 --> 09:37.332
Oh, so nice to see you.

09:38.167 --> 09:40.014
We're starving.
- OK, go, go.

09:40.114 --> 09:42.809
What have you got?
- Er, well, there's a bit of...

09:42.909 --> 09:44.226
Sam. Sam.

09:44.326 --> 09:46.854
Thank you so much for your letter.
It meant a lot to me.

09:46.954 --> 09:47.954
Oh, Sarah, look,

09:48.054 --> 09:49.815
I'm so sorry that I
couldn't be there.

09:49.915 --> 09:51.995
You know, mid-terms and...

09:52.042 --> 09:54.943
You know, Sam is going
to be Doctor Van Ney...

09:55.043 --> 09:56.404
in like a year's time.

09:56.504 --> 09:57.489
No.

09:57.589 --> 09:59.682
Please tell me it's
longer than that?

09:59.782 --> 10:01.701
I am so proud of my little sister.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.704
Who wants a drink?
- Yes. Me.

10:04.804 --> 10:07.456
Brandy shot?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:07.556 --> 10:09.333
So, Beth...
- Mm-hm?

10:09.433 --> 10:12.873
I hear it all starts
falling apart past 25?

10:13.783 --> 10:15.146
Is that what they teach you...

10:15.246 --> 10:17.173
at medical school,
yeah? To take the piss?

10:17.273 --> 10:19.273
Cheeky bitch.
- Ow.

10:19.359 --> 10:21.469
Can anyone make me
feel any older?

10:21.569 --> 10:23.888
Oh, here we go.
- Hello.

10:23.988 --> 10:27.725
Hi, you must be the teacher.
- Beth, Sarah, this is Holly.

10:27.825 --> 10:30.060
Juno's protégé.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.422
I always thought Juno
would eat her young.

10:32.522 --> 10:33.522
Oh, nice.

10:33.622 --> 10:35.982
I'm well able to handle myself,
thanks very much.

10:36.082 --> 10:37.109
I've heard about you.

10:37.209 --> 10:39.569
You're that mentalist
that jumps off buildings.

10:39.669 --> 10:41.940
Base jumping. You should
try it, seriously.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.447
So you live in America now?

10:43.547 --> 10:45.526
Ran out of things to
jump off in Galway,

10:45.626 --> 10:46.033
you know.

10:46.133 --> 10:48.661
I'm always searching
for the next big high.

10:48.761 --> 10:50.996
Sure you'd know all about that.
- Sorry?

10:51.096 --> 10:52.238
Juno showed me a photo...

10:52.338 --> 10:53.957
of when you used
to climb together.

10:54.057 --> 10:57.669
I found this classic picture. Ah.

10:57.769 --> 10:59.921
Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

11:00.021 --> 11:03.966
Look at the state of us.
- Oh, my God. That's bad.

11:04.066 --> 11:06.066
Sexy.

11:07.332 --> 11:09.332
Love each day.

11:10.877 --> 11:13.917
Used to be something
Paul used to say.

11:15.714 --> 11:17.812
Anyway... cheers.

11:17.912 --> 11:20.761
Here's to our adventure.

11:21.678 --> 11:23.722
Skol.
- Cheers.

11:29.018 --> 11:31.258
Come on, light, you bastard.

11:34.231 --> 11:36.997
So, have you done
Boreham Caverns before?

11:37.097 --> 11:40.291
I saw it in a book once.
It's for tourists. It's not adventure.

11:40.391 --> 11:43.920
Might as well have hand rails
and a fucking gift shop.

11:44.020 --> 11:46.980
If you're a caver, jumper, climber...

11:47.410 --> 11:49.717
...you just do it
and not give a shite.

11:49.817 --> 11:53.737
Or the thing that's bigger
than you will get you.

11:58.378 --> 12:02.858
You want adventure, Holly?
When have I ever let you down?

12:03.508 --> 12:05.356
What?

12:05.456 --> 12:08.896
Holly, tomorrow is
going to be awesome. OK?

12:10.139 --> 12:13.059
Take this. You need it.

12:22.734 --> 12:25.666
What about Josh, Sam?
Are you guys still together?

12:25.766 --> 12:28.335
Kind of. Sort of.

12:28.435 --> 12:30.700
Different... shifts.

12:31.409 --> 12:33.661
Oh, my God.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.207
Oh, my Jesus.
- What do you think, eh?

12:40.917 --> 12:43.349
Don't say a fucking word, all right?

12:43.449 --> 12:45.609
It was a Christmas present.

12:51.344 --> 12:53.344
Shut up.

12:54.388 --> 12:56.820
What about you Holly? Got a man?
- Oh...

12:56.920 --> 12:58.404
I'm a sports fuck like Juno.

12:58.504 --> 13:01.228
What?
- Rebecca, too, I think.

13:04.939 --> 13:08.859
But when I'm older,
I want to have lots of babies.

13:09.777 --> 13:12.488
Beth, did Sarah tell you that...

14:58.877 --> 15:00.962
Oh.

15:02.088 --> 15:03.769
Wakey.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.187
Wakey.

15:05.287 --> 15:08.315
I feel like road kill.
Give me five minutes.

15:08.415 --> 15:10.415
Five minutes.

15:27.654 --> 15:31.014
Good morning, my little ones.
Wakey, wakey.

15:31.407 --> 15:32.407
Good morning.

15:32.507 --> 15:35.715
Is that what you call it?
It's fucking freezing.

15:35.815 --> 15:37.815
Holly.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.725
We're leaving at
seven. Don't be late.

15:45.825 --> 15:47.825
Try that.

15:48.798 --> 15:50.854
The queen is dead.

15:50.954 --> 15:54.011
Long live... the fucking queen.

16:03.687 --> 16:05.326
Beth, you're not driving....

16:05.426 --> 16:08.329
If you drive we'll never get there.
- Paper, scissors, stone.

16:08.429 --> 16:10.164
Come on.
- Oh, you're a dick.

16:10.264 --> 16:12.264
Go on.
- OK.

16:12.695 --> 16:14.960
There you go.
- No, wait, babe. Best of three.

16:15.060 --> 16:16.461
I'll drive. Right?

16:16.561 --> 16:18.129
Ladies, group photo.

16:18.229 --> 16:20.298
You'd better hurry it
up. We're running late.

16:20.398 --> 16:21.398
I look like shit.

16:21.498 --> 16:24.051
We all look like shit.
Just give me a smile.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.845
Hat? No hat?
- No hat.

16:25.945 --> 16:27.346
No hat, no hat.
- All right....

16:27.446 --> 16:30.246
Run, run, run, run.
- Say 'sausage'.

16:30.324 --> 16:32.324
Sausage.

17:00.822 --> 17:03.921
Sarah, slow down a bit.
- I'm having fun.

17:04.021 --> 17:05.589
She's having fun.

17:05.689 --> 17:07.383
Whoa. Turn, turn, turn there.

17:07.483 --> 17:09.483
Let's off road.
- Great.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.556
You should have some water.

17:14.656 --> 17:16.780
Trying to set this
watch is impossible.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.726
The buttons are too fucking small.

17:18.826 --> 17:20.853
Leave it alone.
- Why do you wear it, anyway?

17:20.953 --> 17:23.231
My boyfriend gave it to
me, it's sentimental.

17:23.330 --> 17:24.315
It's fucking mental.

17:24.415 --> 17:27.855
Any guy that gave that
to me, I'd dump him.

17:29.474 --> 17:31.572
Juno, are you sure
this is the right way?

17:31.672 --> 17:34.652
Relax, I've never
been lost in my life.

17:34.752 --> 17:36.752
Marvelous.

17:47.365 --> 17:48.822
So have you done
these caves before?

17:48.922 --> 17:49.922
No.

17:50.022 --> 17:52.633
But they are only level two.
Quite safe, don't worry.

17:52.733 --> 17:53.733
I wasn't.

17:53.833 --> 17:56.136
The only danger is that
I might fall asleep.

17:56.236 --> 17:59.276
Boreham Caves.
More like boredom caves.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.360
Nice parking.
- Thanks.

18:38.996 --> 18:42.470
This one time in Galway.
When I free-climbed the cathedral,

18:42.570 --> 18:43.687
a priest chased me...

18:43.787 --> 18:45.681
down the whole of
the ground floor.

18:45.781 --> 18:48.058
That was brilliant....

18:48.158 --> 18:50.545
I shouldn't have wasted
the effort, though.

18:50.645 --> 18:51.645
Holly, shut up.

18:51.745 --> 18:53.814
Rebecca, leave her alone.

18:53.914 --> 18:57.674
OK, guys, let's get
moving. We're running late.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.605
Come on, keep up.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.348
Hey, Holly, wait up.
Move it, short arse.

19:15.863 --> 19:20.183
Oi, Carter, get to the back.
Come on, you lazy bastard.

19:26.706 --> 19:29.106
You finally caught up with me.

19:32.628 --> 19:34.227
Juno, are we there yet?

19:34.327 --> 19:37.145
There's a river about
half a mile ahead.

19:37.245 --> 19:38.245
When we reach it,

19:38.345 --> 19:40.356
we follow it up to the
mouth of the cave, OK?

19:40.456 --> 19:42.356
How does she know
there's a river up ahead?

19:42.456 --> 19:43.359
I can't hear a thing.

19:43.459 --> 19:44.902
She can probably smell it.

19:45.002 --> 19:47.530
She came up here last week
to check the route out.

19:47.630 --> 19:50.991
It's rule number one -
file a flight plan and stick to it....

19:51.091 --> 19:53.785
And rule number two?
- Don't go wandering off.

19:53.885 --> 19:57.280
You think it's dark when
you turn out the lights.

19:57.380 --> 19:59.720
Well, down there it's pitch black.

19:59.820 --> 20:02.302
You can get dehydration,
disorientation...

20:02.402 --> 20:03.377
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:03.477 --> 20:05.337
...claustrophobia...
- Blah, blah.

20:05.437 --> 20:09.425
...panic attacks,
paranoia, hallucinations,

20:09.525 --> 20:12.165
visual and aural deterioration...

20:31.891 --> 20:33.891
Hey.

20:34.018 --> 20:36.103
Eurgh.

20:37.312 --> 20:40.662
Yeah, lovely, Holly.
A real Kodak moment.

20:40.762 --> 20:43.623
Don't touch it.
- You wouldn't want to piss it off.

20:43.723 --> 20:46.250
What do you think did
that, Sam? A bear?

20:46.350 --> 20:48.460
What is this? Nature Detectives?

20:48.560 --> 20:51.546
It could have been
Big Foot. Come on.

20:51.646 --> 20:54.960
Sam, stop poking it
with a fucking stick.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.680
This is it.

21:19.643 --> 21:22.443
You're having a laugh.
- Afraid not.

21:24.230 --> 21:27.990
I'm an English teacher,
not fucking Tomb Raider.

21:28.359 --> 21:30.359
You'll be fine.

21:36.909 --> 21:40.216
OK, Sarah, Beth, you're up next.
Sam, stay with Becca.

21:40.316 --> 21:42.051
Do what she does
and you'll be fine.

21:42.151 --> 21:46.317
Holly, safety first.
I don't want any stunts this time.

21:46.417 --> 21:48.098
You OK? See you down there.
- No.

21:48.198 --> 21:50.080
Make sure your cow's tail is locked...

21:50.180 --> 21:52.519
there and there. You hold
on to this like that.

21:52.619 --> 21:54.646
Look, I have done this
before, you know?

21:54.746 --> 21:56.925
I'm only looking after you.

21:57.025 --> 21:59.946
And I appreciate it, in small doses.

22:23.159 --> 22:24.757
You gotta see this place.

22:24.857 --> 22:27.134
It's beautiful.

22:27.234 --> 22:30.804
You won't believe this, Beth.
- Oh, shit.

22:30.904 --> 22:32.904
Shit, shit, shit.

22:37.589 --> 22:39.925
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.

22:47.682 --> 22:49.682
Ah, piece of piss.

22:51.978 --> 22:53.492
Oh, my God.

22:53.592 --> 22:54.993
It's incredible....

22:55.093 --> 22:57.093
Clear.

23:03.655 --> 23:06.045
It's Holly.

23:06.145 --> 23:08.145
Shit, move.

23:08.910 --> 23:13.550
Holly, you do this safely,
in order, following my lead. OK?

23:13.610 --> 23:15.610
Take it slow and easy.

23:24.632 --> 23:27.260
Juno.
- Smart arse.

23:59.206 --> 24:00.595
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

24:00.695 --> 24:03.655
They're gone. They're
gone now. Look.

24:06.713 --> 24:09.311
One bat, two bats....

24:09.411 --> 24:11.411
50 bats.

24:12.510 --> 24:14.637
Holly, fuck off.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.446
Which way?

24:20.546 --> 24:23.784
There's only one way
out of this chamber...

24:23.884 --> 24:25.884
and that's down the pipe.

24:34.530 --> 24:36.530
OK.

25:21.073 --> 25:23.073
It's a drop.

25:28.037 --> 25:30.037
OK?

25:33.375 --> 25:35.375
Holly, chuck us your bag.

25:51.767 --> 25:54.019
Oh, my God.

27:17.388 --> 27:19.611
Find anything good?

27:19.711 --> 27:22.767
Jesus Christ.
- Come on, let's eat.

27:28.272 --> 27:30.002
Holly, would you take a break?

27:30.102 --> 27:32.247
I just want to take
a few more shots.

27:32.347 --> 27:35.627
This cave is a lot
cooler than I thought.

27:39.533 --> 27:40.546
Hey?

27:40.646 --> 27:42.646
Not hungry.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.370
Are you OK?

27:45.997 --> 27:48.458
Juno, I won't break. I'm fine.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.067
I asked you for this.
- I know.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.965
Um, Sarah?

27:57.716 --> 28:00.773
I haven't had a chance
to say that I'm......

28:00.873 --> 28:04.097
really sorry I didn't
stay around longer...

28:04.197 --> 28:06.197
after the accident.

28:10.019 --> 28:12.019
Anyway...

28:13.314 --> 28:15.883
...we're all here for you now, OK?

28:15.983 --> 28:17.580
Yeah.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.574
Look, sorry. I'm
feeling a bit out of it.

28:19.674 --> 28:20.667
It's probably jet lag.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.861
So I'm just going to
take a look around, OK?

28:22.961 --> 28:23.961
Yeah, OK.

28:24.061 --> 28:26.589
Why don't you try and find us
the way through, huh?

28:26.689 --> 28:28.911
Hey, don't go too far.

28:36.210 --> 28:39.184
What's up with her?
She looks like she's seen a ghost.

28:39.284 --> 28:41.284
She's fine.

28:59.273 --> 29:01.513
I've found the next passage.

29:10.074 --> 29:13.298
That's it? It's a bit small, isn't it?
- Hey, hey, hey.

29:13.398 --> 29:16.259
I don't get this.
- What?

29:16.359 --> 29:19.012
This is not how I imagined it
from reading the book.

29:19.112 --> 29:20.584
That's why I don't trust books.

29:20.684 --> 29:22.598
Leaves too much room
for interpretation.

29:22.698 --> 29:24.183
Something wrong?

29:24.283 --> 29:26.283
No.
- It's nothing.

29:26.881 --> 29:28.881
I'm taking point, guys.

29:29.884 --> 29:33.964
Careful. Just find the way through.
We'll wait here.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.047
Sarah?

32:30.216 --> 32:32.356
Shit.
- Are you still behind me?

32:32.456 --> 32:34.456
Yes.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.498
Shit.

32:37.598 --> 32:39.237
Shit.

32:39.337 --> 32:40.337
Sarah?

32:40.437 --> 32:42.990
Guys, it's Sarah, I
think she might be stuck.

32:43.090 --> 32:45.090
I am stuck.

32:45.563 --> 32:48.683
All right, Sarah.
Calm down, just relax.

32:49.734 --> 32:52.124
I can't fucking relax.

32:52.224 --> 32:53.500
Fuck, fuck.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.892
Sarah, you have to calm
down and the only way...

32:55.992 --> 32:57.796
you're going to do
that is to breathe.

32:57.896 --> 33:01.536
OK, breathe slowly.
Just keep breathing.

33:04.372 --> 33:07.096
I can't. I can't.

33:07.196 --> 33:11.308
I can't fucking breathe.
- Sarah, OK, listen to me.

33:11.408 --> 33:13.808
Just listen to my voice, yeah?

33:14.381 --> 33:16.993
Sarah, I'm coming.
I'm coming back.

33:17.093 --> 33:18.827
OK? OK.

33:18.927 --> 33:21.067
Sarah, OK?

33:21.167 --> 33:24.933
Listen to me, keep
breathing. OK? Hey.

33:27.018 --> 33:28.741
Hey, hey.

33:28.841 --> 33:32.327
OK. OK. OK.

33:32.427 --> 33:36.581
Look here at me, Sarah, hey?
- Help me.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.859
What are you so
worried about, Sarah?

33:38.959 --> 33:39.959
Look at me.

33:40.059 --> 33:42.086
OK, breathe. Breathe, OK?

33:42.186 --> 33:44.505
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.

33:44.605 --> 33:47.333
Listen to me. What
are you so afraid of?

33:47.433 --> 33:48.842
I can't fucking move.

33:48.942 --> 33:52.462
You can move. Sarah,
look at me, look at me.

33:53.167 --> 33:55.392
The worst thing that
could have happened to...

33:55.492 --> 33:57.767
you has already happened
and you're still here.

33:57.867 --> 34:00.497
This is just a poxy cave
and there's nothing left...

34:00.597 --> 34:01.938
to be afraid of, I promise.

34:02.038 --> 34:03.814
OK? OK?

34:03.914 --> 34:05.941
Hey. Hey, listen, listen.

34:06.041 --> 34:07.950
Listen to me, you'll love this one.

34:08.050 --> 34:09.902
How do you give a
lemon an orgasm?

34:10.003 --> 34:11.960
God damn it, let me
hear you say it.

34:12.061 --> 34:13.907
How do you give a
lemon an orgasm?

34:14.007 --> 34:16.409
What do you do? You
tickle its citrus.

34:16.509 --> 34:18.203
OK, that's better. Come on.

34:18.303 --> 34:20.447
OK, OK. All right,
we're going to move now.

34:20.547 --> 34:22.081
Take hold of my arm, all right?

34:22.181 --> 34:24.875
We're going to move slowly.
That's it, grab my arm, OK?

34:24.975 --> 34:26.168
OK, come on.

34:26.268 --> 34:29.467
Just slowly. Pull on me, OK?
OK, come on.

34:31.702 --> 34:34.676
The rope bag. I
forgot the rope bag.

34:34.775 --> 34:36.775
OK.

34:42.212 --> 34:45.811
OK, fuck the rope
bag. OK, move, now.

34:45.911 --> 34:46.937
Now.

34:47.036 --> 34:49.036
Hurry up.

34:49.177 --> 34:51.177
Sarah, come on.

34:51.762 --> 34:54.081
Sarah, keep hold of the rope.

35:14.658 --> 35:16.423
Sarah?

35:16.523 --> 35:17.590
Oh, ah.

35:17.690 --> 35:19.551
Are you OK?
- I'm all right.

35:19.651 --> 35:22.470
Is everybody OK?
Is everybody OK?

35:22.570 --> 35:24.472
Don't fucking touch me.
Rebecca?

35:24.572 --> 35:26.891
I'm here, I'm OK.
Beth, are you injured?

35:26.991 --> 35:28.183
No, I'm fine.

35:28.283 --> 35:31.428
Nobody move until
the dust has settled.

35:31.528 --> 35:35.083
Don't worry, Juno, we're
not going anywhere.

35:36.261 --> 35:38.109
You might be right about that.

35:38.209 --> 35:40.209
Jesus.

35:42.225 --> 35:44.311
So what's the story now?

35:45.145 --> 35:46.655
According to the guidebook,

35:46.755 --> 35:48.786
this cave system
has three ways out.

35:48.886 --> 35:52.726
This is just one of them.
Isn't that right, Juno?

35:52.985 --> 35:55.305
Juno, that's right, isn't it?

35:55.654 --> 35:57.654
Check the book.

35:58.991 --> 36:01.076
I didn't bring it.
- What?

36:02.369 --> 36:04.369
No point.

36:04.954 --> 36:07.052
For Christ's sake, Juno.

36:07.152 --> 36:09.596
I knew it. I knew this wasn't right.

36:09.696 --> 36:11.661
You filed a flight plan
to mountain rescue?

36:11.761 --> 36:14.101
If we don't report in,
they'll come looking for us.

36:14.201 --> 36:16.074
That's how it's supposed to work...

36:16.174 --> 36:18.980
except I put in a flight
plan for Boreham Caverns...

36:19.080 --> 36:21.899
and this isn't Boreham
Caverns, is it, Juno?

36:21.999 --> 36:23.818
We're in the wrong fucking cave?

36:23.918 --> 36:24.752
Holly was right.

36:24.852 --> 36:26.737
Boreham Caverns
was a tourist trap.

36:26.837 --> 36:29.803
Don't try and pin this
fucking shite on me.

36:29.903 --> 36:32.659
This is not caving.
This is an ego trip.

36:32.759 --> 36:33.759
Rebecca,

36:33.859 --> 36:35.495
I didn't know this
was going to happen.

36:35.595 --> 36:37.288
This is exactly what we believe in.

36:37.388 --> 36:39.749
We said, if there's no
risk, what's the point?

36:39.849 --> 36:42.126
Don't try and justify this.

36:42.226 --> 36:44.226
Where... Where are we?

36:44.783 --> 36:47.590
It hasn't got a name.
It's a new system.

36:47.690 --> 36:50.259
I wanted us all to discover it.

36:50.359 --> 36:53.053
No-one's ever been
down here before.

36:53.153 --> 36:56.033
You're fucking kidding me.
- Oh, God.

36:57.377 --> 37:00.727
How the hell do we get out?
There may not be a way out.

37:00.827 --> 37:03.396
Look, there's no going back now.

37:03.496 --> 37:05.430
We have to find a way
out of this chamber...

37:05.530 --> 37:06.607
and keep pushing forward.

37:06.707 --> 37:08.984
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

37:09.084 --> 37:11.098
We all trusted you. You told me...

37:11.198 --> 37:13.334
this was going to
be good for Sarah.

37:13.434 --> 37:16.032
Have you any idea what
she's been through?

37:16.132 --> 37:18.094
No, cos you couldn't
get away fast enough,

37:18.194 --> 37:18.910
you selfish cow.

37:19.010 --> 37:21.010
You know what, Beth?

37:21.053 --> 37:24.486
We all lost something
in that crash.

37:28.865 --> 37:30.950
Just get us out of here.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.050
Look, cave systems...

37:35.150 --> 37:38.553
sometimes break ground.
It's a small chance.

37:38.653 --> 37:40.763
But if we stay here, we'll die.

37:40.863 --> 37:42.863
Let's go.

38:14.949 --> 38:16.296
Wait.
- What?

38:16.396 --> 38:18.631
Don't move, Sam. Just don't move.

38:18.731 --> 38:20.731
Stay right there.

38:47.937 --> 38:49.937
Oh, shit. No more.

39:01.241 --> 39:03.798
Thanks, Beth.

39:03.898 --> 39:06.425
Now I know how far down it is.

39:06.525 --> 39:08.260
So, what now?

39:08.360 --> 39:11.835
One of us has to get all
the way across there...

39:11.935 --> 39:14.528
so they can rig a line for you guys.

39:14.628 --> 39:18.010
I have three cams, I need
at least three more.

39:18.110 --> 39:20.075
Where's the other rope bag?

39:20.175 --> 39:22.175
Where is it?

39:22.719 --> 39:25.599
We lost it, when
the cave collapsed.

39:26.055 --> 39:28.055
Sorry.

39:45.198 --> 39:47.198
Help me.

40:13.849 --> 40:15.849
Come on, Becca....

40:37.287 --> 40:39.287
Aargh.
- You got it.

40:48.965 --> 40:50.965
Come on, come on.

40:51.259 --> 40:53.648
Come on, Rebecca.

40:53.748 --> 40:55.817
Come on, Rebecca.

40:55.917 --> 40:57.973
What are you waiting for?

41:00.642 --> 41:01.989
Fuck.
- Are you OK?

41:02.089 --> 41:03.866
What's wrong?

41:03.966 --> 41:06.660
It's nothing. I'm all right.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.760
OK.

41:19.159 --> 41:21.578
All right, more slack.

41:22.996 --> 41:24.996
More slack, thanks.

41:30.211 --> 41:32.211
Fuck.

41:39.553 --> 41:41.805
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

41:43.974 --> 41:46.059
OK.
Well done.

41:47.268 --> 41:51.606
OK.
Throw me the right rope.

41:55.276 --> 41:57.276
OK.

41:58.278 --> 42:00.278
OK.

42:06.077 --> 42:08.077
Come on.

42:19.715 --> 42:20.978
Yeah.

42:21.078 --> 42:26.118
Now, you make it look easy.
- Yeah, well, you make it look hard.

42:31.142 --> 42:32.142
Oh.

42:32.242 --> 42:34.241
Don't look down,
Beth. Keep going....

42:34.341 --> 42:37.461
Just keep going.
You're OK. You're safe.

42:41.068 --> 42:43.820
Good. There you go.

42:50.826 --> 42:52.912
Was this about me or you?

42:55.706 --> 42:56.776
It's about us,

42:56.876 --> 42:59.676
getting back to
what we used to be.

43:00.168 --> 43:03.155
I wanted us to claim
this place, name it.

43:03.255 --> 43:05.644
I thought maybe your name.

43:05.744 --> 43:07.744
Or maybe yours.

43:13.472 --> 43:15.632
You're doing well. Come on.

43:16.308 --> 43:18.308
Come on.

43:20.145 --> 43:23.505
There you are. Come
on, give me your hand.

43:38.036 --> 43:40.036
Juno?

43:40.163 --> 43:42.723
We'll need everything we've got.

43:43.959 --> 43:45.960
Haul it in.

44:06.980 --> 44:08.980
Fuck.

44:27.290 --> 44:29.290
Yes.

44:32.294 --> 44:33.683
Reach.

44:33.783 --> 44:35.783
Reach out.

44:36.465 --> 44:37.991
Aargh.

44:38.091 --> 44:39.647
Juno.

44:39.747 --> 44:41.747
No.

44:57.067 --> 44:59.387
Juno, it's OK, we've got you.

44:59.474 --> 45:01.474
OK, pull.

45:04.491 --> 45:06.784
Sam.
Holly, let me pass.

45:07.827 --> 45:09.987
Rebecca, show me your hand.

45:24.801 --> 45:26.357
Let go, let go.

45:26.457 --> 45:29.997
What does it mean?
- It means we're not the first.

45:30.097 --> 45:32.112
It's a piton, right?

45:32.212 --> 45:33.212
If cavers were here,

45:33.312 --> 45:35.365
there's a better chance
of us getting out.

45:35.465 --> 45:37.621
This equipment is at
least 100 years old.

45:37.721 --> 45:39.661
No-one uses stuff
like this any more.

45:39.761 --> 45:41.605
Besides, if anyone
had been down here...

45:41.705 --> 45:42.705
and made it out,

45:42.805 --> 45:45.445
they would have named it already.

45:45.612 --> 45:48.127
Becca, are you OK?

45:48.227 --> 45:50.227
I'll live.

45:53.828 --> 45:56.176
Holly, how does it look?

45:56.276 --> 45:58.303
It's tight again, but
I can get through.

45:58.403 --> 46:01.763
OK, keep going. We'll
be right behind you.

46:14.013 --> 46:16.653
Hey, there's something down here.

46:47.835 --> 46:48.965
Guys, it's amazing,

46:49.065 --> 46:51.810
but the batteries on
our lights will run out.

46:51.910 --> 46:55.272
So I suggest we keep moving.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

46:55.372 --> 46:58.816
What is it, Beth?
- Juno, light up one of your flares.

46:58.916 --> 47:02.836
We don't have time for this.
- Just light a flare.

47:13.943 --> 47:16.286
Really lovely, Beth, but
it's fucking useless.

47:16.386 --> 47:18.001
No, look at it. What do you see?

47:18.101 --> 47:20.128
You've got the
mountain, the cave......

47:20.228 --> 47:22.784
and there's two entrances.

47:26.329 --> 47:29.595
You are a fucking genius.
- I have my moments.

47:29.695 --> 47:32.415
This means there's
another way out?

47:32.515 --> 47:33.652
Let's find out.

47:33.752 --> 47:35.752
Come on.

47:54.146 --> 47:56.202
Bastard.
- Which way?

47:56.302 --> 47:58.542
Holly, give me your lighter.

48:00.235 --> 48:02.235
Come on.
- Here.

48:06.699 --> 48:08.699
Fuck.

48:08.951 --> 48:11.912
Come on. Come on.
- Shit.

48:15.207 --> 48:18.085
That one.
- Hey. Holly.

48:20.128 --> 48:22.297
Holly, slow down.

48:25.049 --> 48:28.594
Holly. Careful.

48:29.679 --> 48:31.999
Daylight. I can see daylight.

48:34.850 --> 48:37.782
Holly. Careful. Slow down.

48:37.882 --> 48:40.689
Holly, it's not daylight.

48:47.153 --> 48:49.153
Help me.
- Hold on.

48:49.655 --> 48:51.824
Guys. Hold...

48:52.533 --> 48:54.533
Holly.

49:00.999 --> 49:03.180
Sam. Get down here.

49:03.280 --> 49:05.280
Holly.

49:05.962 --> 49:07.962
Holly.

49:21.476 --> 49:23.770
Holly. Answer me.

49:31.360 --> 49:32.791
I think I hurt my leg.

49:32.891 --> 49:36.073
Don't move. We're
coming down to you.

49:37.991 --> 49:40.077
Oh, fuck.

49:44.664 --> 49:47.667
No. Fuck.

49:55.466 --> 49:57.885
Someone better get down here.

50:07.435 --> 50:10.742
Oh, that's fucking disgusting.
- Beth. Not here, not now.

50:10.842 --> 50:13.178
We need help. Everybody
grab a corner.

50:13.278 --> 50:15.551
We need to move her
out of the water.

50:15.651 --> 50:18.958
Nice and easy now. And... lift.

50:19.058 --> 50:21.058
Argh.

50:22.282 --> 50:23.282
You fuckers.

50:23.382 --> 50:25.423
Juno, find something to
make a splint out of.

50:25.523 --> 50:26.609
It's OK, I've got her.

50:26.709 --> 50:28.467
Hey, Juno, use one of the ice axes.

50:28.567 --> 50:31.127
You'll be all right, sweetheart.

50:43.426 --> 50:45.512
OK.

50:47.055 --> 50:48.055
Sarah.

50:48.155 --> 50:49.653
Juno, I'm gonna need
your help here.

50:49.753 --> 50:51.753
Sarah.
- Juno.

50:52.268 --> 50:54.741
Take hold of her arm.
You'll have to hold her down.

50:54.841 --> 50:56.242
What are you gonna do?

50:56.342 --> 50:58.378
I need to dress the wound
and rig up a splint,

50:58.478 --> 51:00.288
but I can't while the
bone is protruding.

51:00.388 --> 51:02.468
I need to push it back in.

51:03.403 --> 51:06.085
I hate you.
- I know.

51:06.185 --> 51:08.185
Do it.

51:22.295 --> 51:24.560
Bite down on this.

51:24.660 --> 51:27.396
Keep hold of her.
- Just fucking bite down, OK?

51:27.496 --> 51:29.552
Go.

51:33.097 --> 51:35.097
Come on.

51:42.147 --> 51:44.286
Just keep biting down, baby.

51:44.386 --> 51:46.484
Come on.

51:48.319 --> 51:51.030
OK, someone get me a medical kit.

51:52.865 --> 51:56.225
OK, OK, OK. Calm down.
It'll be all right.

52:32.401 --> 52:34.457
What are you doing?

52:34.557 --> 52:37.837
I just saw something
ahead in the tunnel.

52:39.866 --> 52:42.840
Sarah, I promise you,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

52:42.940 --> 52:45.051
But I can't do it
unless you're with me.

52:45.151 --> 52:47.206
Sarah?

52:48.249 --> 52:50.249
Sarah.

52:51.252 --> 52:53.337
Sarah, look at me.

52:54.129 --> 52:56.215
There's nothing there.

53:00.761 --> 53:02.024
That's the best I can do.

53:02.124 --> 53:04.412
It'll hurt like hell and
you can't put any weight...

53:04.512 --> 53:05.945
on it, but at least you can move.

53:06.045 --> 53:08.019
They combed these
mountains centuries ago.

53:08.119 --> 53:09.948
Anyone trapped would
be a skeleton now.

53:10.048 --> 53:11.950
That is just what it looked like.
- What?

53:12.050 --> 53:14.119
Sarah thinks she saw someone.
- Saw what?

53:14.219 --> 53:16.705
I don't think I saw
someone, I saw someone.

53:16.805 --> 53:19.499
No, you heard something
and saw what you wanted to see.

53:19.599 --> 53:21.546
It's the dark. It
plays tricks on people.

53:21.646 --> 53:23.252
I can describe exactly what I saw.

53:23.352 --> 53:26.392
What did you see?
- A man. I saw a man.

53:26.480 --> 53:28.507
Are you sure?
- Yes.

53:28.607 --> 53:30.340
And it's not the first time. I thought

53:30.440 --> 53:32.219
I saw someone before,
but now I'm sure.

53:32.319 --> 53:34.163
Look, if there is
somebody down here,

53:34.263 --> 53:36.056
then maybe they can
help get us out.

53:36.156 --> 53:38.766
Sarah, there's no-one down here.
Forget about it.

53:38.866 --> 53:41.102
Hey, we have to get
Holly out of here.

53:41.202 --> 53:44.322
OK? This is all that
matters right now.

53:44.551 --> 53:47.191
Beth.
- It's OK.

53:47.291 --> 53:49.347
Is it? Fuck.

53:51.140 --> 53:52.446
Fuck me.

53:52.546 --> 53:54.602
You've got to keep warm.

53:55.894 --> 53:58.826
Why are we walking away?
There was daylight back there.

53:58.926 --> 54:01.162
It wasn't. It was
phosphorus in the rock.

54:01.262 --> 54:04.332
We're two miles underground,
the only light down here is ours.

54:04.432 --> 54:08.432
Argh. Well, it looked like
fucking daylight to me.

54:22.002 --> 54:24.002
Right tunnel.

54:40.811 --> 54:43.355
I got you. OK?

55:53.002 --> 55:56.101
Jesus. What is this place?

55:56.201 --> 55:59.258
Holly, where's the infrared button?

56:07.432 --> 56:08.821
Dead animals.

56:08.921 --> 56:11.198
Hundreds of them.

56:11.298 --> 56:12.783
This is not good, guys.

56:12.883 --> 56:14.910
Can we get out of
here? Which way?

56:15.010 --> 56:17.065
Come on.

56:19.401 --> 56:20.085
I don't know.

56:20.185 --> 56:21.999
What do you mean,
you don't know?

56:22.099 --> 56:23.864
There's no breeze. It could be...

56:23.964 --> 56:26.170
any one of these
tunnels. Take your pick.

56:26.270 --> 56:28.756
Oh, fuck it. Hello.

56:28.856 --> 56:32.843
Please.
- Is there anybody there?

56:32.943 --> 56:34.999
Hello.

56:41.088 --> 56:45.008
It's there. It's up there.
It's there on the roof.

56:51.597 --> 56:55.113
Fucking hell, did you see...?
What the fuck was that?

56:55.213 --> 56:55.793
I don't know.

56:55.893 --> 56:57.782
It moved so fast, I
could barely see it.

56:57.882 --> 56:59.805
I've never seen anyone
climb like that.

56:59.905 --> 57:01.119
I told you I saw someone.

57:01.219 --> 57:03.371
That was not a human being.
- Screw this.

57:03.471 --> 57:07.231
Let's take our chances
and pick a tunnel. Move.

57:16.537 --> 57:18.593
What's happening?

57:18.693 --> 57:21.333
Oh, shit. It's circling us.

57:29.632 --> 57:33.356
Where is it?
- This way. Move.

57:33.456 --> 57:36.914
Holly. We've got to
move. We've got to move.

57:37.014 --> 57:38.319
Come on. Move it.

57:38.419 --> 57:41.768
Come on, Holly. Move it. Let's go.

57:43.103 --> 57:46.143
Juno, the flare. Get rid of it.
- Fuck.

57:46.898 --> 57:50.484
Holly, keep moving, come on.

58:05.623 --> 58:07.625
Holly. Holly.

58:08.501 --> 58:10.501
Sarah.

58:11.045 --> 58:13.756
Holly.

58:25.767 --> 58:27.767
Sarah.

58:29.145 --> 58:31.605
Sarah. Run.

58:34.900 --> 58:36.900
Sarah.

58:48.913 --> 58:50.636
Get off.

58:50.736 --> 58:52.736
Get away, you fucker.

01:00:25.877 --> 01:00:27.877
Don't leave me.

01:00:51.734 --> 01:00:54.653
Oh, fuck. My battery's gone dead.

01:00:56.196 --> 01:00:58.196
Where are they?

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.757
What's happened to the others?

01:01:02.857 --> 01:01:06.537
Becca, please say we're
gonna get out of here.

01:01:07.123 --> 01:01:09.179
OK. OK.

01:01:09.279 --> 01:01:11.335
OK.

01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:17.883
Go. Go.

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.955
Mummy. Mummy.

01:01:37.055 --> 01:01:39.055
If you're really ready...

01:03:47.937 --> 01:03:50.022
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

01:04:24.846 --> 01:04:26.931
Turn the light off.

01:04:32.728 --> 01:04:34.813
Quiet.

01:05:08.052 --> 01:05:10.052
Sarah. Sarah.

01:05:11.889 --> 01:05:13.889
Sarah.

01:06:28.668 --> 01:06:30.753
It can't see us.

01:06:54.233 --> 01:06:56.276
Sam? Becca?

01:06:58.070 --> 01:07:00.697
Becca.

01:07:01.573 --> 01:07:03.004
Becca.
- It's Juno.

01:07:03.104 --> 01:07:04.338
Becca.

01:07:04.438 --> 01:07:06.165
The noise she's
making, she'll bring...

01:07:06.265 --> 01:07:08.175
every one of those
things down on her head.

01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:10.706
As long as it's not on mine.

01:07:17.004 --> 01:07:19.089
Becca.

01:07:22.676 --> 01:07:24.761
Sam.

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.312
Sam.

01:08:22.647 --> 01:08:24.733
Sam.

01:08:26.317 --> 01:08:28.374
Anyone?

01:08:28.474 --> 01:08:30.474
Sam.

01:08:52.466 --> 01:08:54.635
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:08:56.178 --> 01:08:57.484
Oh...

01:08:57.584 --> 01:08:59.584
I'm sorry.

01:10:23.133 --> 01:10:25.218
Fuck. OK.

01:10:28.388 --> 01:10:30.388
OK.

01:10:34.518 --> 01:10:35.865
OK.

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:38.021
It's all clear.

01:11:10.009 --> 01:11:12.009
Sam, run.

01:11:55.759 --> 01:11:58.159
We heard you crying for Sarah.

01:12:01.431 --> 01:12:03.431
Where are the others?

01:12:05.268 --> 01:12:07.353
They... They took Holly.

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:11.065
Beth...

01:12:13.567 --> 01:12:15.567
Beth's dead.

01:12:30.499 --> 01:12:32.585
Sam...

01:12:34.169 --> 01:12:36.169
...what is that thing?

01:12:40.801 --> 01:12:43.774
I don't know. Well,
it does look human.

01:12:43.874 --> 01:12:46.364
Come on, we need to
find the way out...

01:12:46.464 --> 01:12:48.237
before those things find us.

01:12:48.337 --> 01:12:49.822
No.

01:12:49.922 --> 01:12:53.270
Sam, tell us what we're fighting.

01:12:54.104 --> 01:12:56.104
Well...

01:12:56.982 --> 01:12:59.038
...they're totally blind.

01:12:59.138 --> 01:13:01.728
And judging from what we've seen,

01:13:01.828 --> 01:13:05.668
I'd say they use sound to
hunt with. Like a bat.

01:13:06.908 --> 01:13:11.628
And they've evolved perfectly
to live down here in the dark.

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:17.472
Whatever they are,
they go to the surface to hunt.

01:13:17.572 --> 01:13:21.081
And they bring their food
back down here to eat,

01:13:21.181 --> 01:13:22.614
through an entrance.

01:13:22.714 --> 01:13:27.594
Listen, if we can stay quiet enough
and evade these fuckers...

01:13:28.928 --> 01:13:30.651
...I think I found the way out.

01:13:30.751 --> 01:13:32.361
You think?

01:13:32.461 --> 01:13:35.415
The climbing gear we
found - whoever...

01:13:35.515 --> 01:13:38.875
brought that down here
marked their route.

01:13:39.271 --> 01:13:42.286
I found those markings.
- Well, what are we waiting for?

01:13:42.386 --> 01:13:44.401
Sarah.

01:13:46.694 --> 01:13:49.094
I'm not leaving without Sarah.

01:14:11.008 --> 01:14:13.093
Sarah.

01:14:14.678 --> 01:14:16.764
Oh, God.

01:14:17.639 --> 01:14:19.639
Oh, God.

01:14:20.767 --> 01:14:22.852
Oh, God. No.

01:14:23.728 --> 01:14:25.728
Sarah...

01:14:26.648 --> 01:14:28.888
I'm getting you out of here.

01:14:30.985 --> 01:14:33.465
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

01:14:36.323 --> 01:14:38.046
I heard Juno calling me.

01:14:38.146 --> 01:14:39.317
I'm gonna go and find her,

01:14:39.417 --> 01:14:41.340
and we're gonna come
back and get you out.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.467
No, stay away from her.

01:14:43.567 --> 01:14:46.512
What?
- She did this to me.

01:14:46.612 --> 01:14:49.473
What?
- She left me.

01:14:49.573 --> 01:14:51.141
No, she didn't. No.

01:14:51.241 --> 01:14:53.297
Shh.
- Sarah...

01:14:55.049 --> 01:14:57.134
Don't trust her.

01:14:58.135 --> 01:15:00.358
You find your own way out.

01:15:00.458 --> 01:15:02.485
It's OK. It's all right.

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:06.071
I'm not gonna leave you, Beth.
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:15:06.171 --> 01:15:08.198
I'm not leaving you here, OK?

01:15:08.298 --> 01:15:10.563
Come here. Beth.

01:15:17.694 --> 01:15:19.780
This is Juno's.

01:15:23.366 --> 01:15:25.451
It's from Paul.

01:15:27.245 --> 01:15:29.330
Oh, no.

01:15:39.339 --> 01:15:41.424
Sorry.

01:15:51.976 --> 01:15:55.283
Please... Oh, that's them.
Please, come with me.

01:15:55.383 --> 01:15:57.035
Please.

01:15:57.135 --> 01:15:59.135
Sarah...

01:15:59.775 --> 01:16:02.902
...don't leave me like this.

01:16:04.946 --> 01:16:08.087
No, please don't ask me to do that.

01:16:08.187 --> 01:16:10.756
Please.
- I can't. I can't do that.

01:16:10.856 --> 01:16:12.507
I can't do that.

01:16:12.607 --> 01:16:14.663
Please.

01:16:26.716 --> 01:16:29.148
OK. Ssh.

01:16:29.248 --> 01:16:31.248
Close your eyes.

01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:22.515
Hurry. Move.

01:20:26.853 --> 01:20:28.938
Sarah?

01:20:30.106 --> 01:20:32.191
Sarah?

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:34.831
Sarah?

01:20:34.931 --> 01:20:38.835
Look, she's dead, Juno.
We can't wait for her.

01:20:38.935 --> 01:20:40.935
Come on.

01:20:41.533 --> 01:20:44.244
Sarah.

01:20:45.286 --> 01:20:47.286
Sarah.

01:20:56.839 --> 01:20:58.924
Sarah?

01:21:00.509 --> 01:21:02.594
Sarah?

01:21:06.889 --> 01:21:09.350
Run.

01:21:37.751 --> 01:21:39.836
Oh, fuck.

01:22:12.992 --> 01:22:14.673
Fuck.

01:22:14.773 --> 01:22:15.773
Come on.

01:22:15.873 --> 01:22:19.153
Juno, stop her. I'll
be right behind you.

01:22:40.392 --> 01:22:43.324
Sam. What are you doing?

01:22:43.424 --> 01:22:44.909
Come back.

01:22:45.009 --> 01:22:46.619
Becca.

01:22:46.719 --> 01:22:48.704
You haven't got enough rope.

01:22:48.804 --> 01:22:51.527
Sam. Turn around.

01:22:53.362 --> 01:22:55.669
What are you doing? Turn around.
- Sam, baby.

01:22:55.769 --> 01:22:56.769
Sam. Sam.

01:22:56.869 --> 01:23:00.048
Sam, turn around.
You can come back.

01:23:00.148 --> 01:23:03.788
Please, baby, listen to me. Please.

01:23:07.542 --> 01:23:09.542
Sam.

01:23:11.837 --> 01:23:13.837
No.

01:23:14.256 --> 01:23:16.425
What are you doing?

01:23:26.643 --> 01:23:28.643
Sam.

01:23:35.025 --> 01:23:37.986
Sam. No.

01:25:53.152 --> 01:25:55.152
What happened to you?

01:25:58.657 --> 01:26:00.657
Rebecca?

01:26:06.289 --> 01:26:08.289
What about Beth?

01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:13.669
Didn't make it.

01:26:19.551 --> 01:26:21.551
You saw her die?

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:35.939
Come on.

01:27:32.993 --> 01:27:35.537
Come on. Come on.

01:30:43.877 --> 01:30:46.588
No. No.

01:32:26.721 --> 01:32:28.721
Oh, God.
