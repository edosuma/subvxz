WEBVTT

00:08.180 --> 00:10.527
-Oh Mr. Vaughns dad's not well,
so they've gone to stay

00:10.562 --> 00:11.390
with him for a couple of days.

00:11.425 --> 00:12.253
-Oh, doesn't mind.

00:12.288 --> 00:13.461
Mom's on a split shift.

00:13.496 --> 00:15.222
We'll have a laugh.

00:15.256 --> 00:17.396
-Sorry it's already been
arranged between his social

00:17.431 --> 00:18.811
worker and my parents.

00:18.846 --> 00:21.297
-Since when did a social worker
tell Rhydian what he

00:21.331 --> 00:22.574
can or can't do?

00:22.608 --> 00:25.542
-Yeah, well, I mean they're
expecting me now.

00:25.577 --> 00:26.371
Maybe another time.

00:26.405 --> 00:28.752
Sorry Mate.

00:28.787 --> 00:30.064
See you tomorrow?

00:33.826 --> 00:35.725
-Did you buy all that?

00:35.759 --> 00:36.760
-What?

00:36.795 --> 00:37.589
-Duh.

00:37.623 --> 00:39.177
-Oh, don't start, Tom.

00:39.211 --> 00:42.180
-Shannon, don't take this the
wrong way, but you're not

00:42.214 --> 00:44.251
really an expert on
the whole boy-girl

00:44.285 --> 00:45.735
flirting thing, are you?

00:45.769 --> 00:47.254
-Oh, and you are?

00:47.288 --> 00:49.773
-Well, he was all over her
after we saw that beast.

00:49.808 --> 00:53.122
What I'm saying is, either her
parents won't be there or they

00:53.156 --> 00:56.297
won't, at least for four
or five hours anyway.

00:56.332 --> 00:57.643
-Just drop it, Tom.

00:57.678 --> 01:00.784
There is nothing going on
with Maddy and Rhydian.

01:00.819 --> 01:13.901
THEME SONG: A promise that I
keep, I'll never share, I'll

01:13.935 --> 01:14.867
never speak.

01:14.902 --> 01:17.905
To my grave the secret goes.

01:17.939 --> 01:20.804
The beating heart, the
beating heart.

01:20.839 --> 01:23.255
Where mystic creatures
wandered far.

01:23.290 --> 01:26.569
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:26.603 --> 01:29.503
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:33.196 --> 01:35.509
-Living near humans
is always a risk.

01:35.543 --> 01:37.131
-That's why we keep
our heads down?

01:37.166 --> 01:38.132
-We'll live out here.

01:38.167 --> 01:39.616
-It's all about responsibility.

01:39.651 --> 01:41.549
-Being a wolfblood affects
everything.

01:41.584 --> 01:43.172
-Well, that sounded
like a hermit.

01:43.206 --> 01:44.173
-No, no, no, no.

01:44.207 --> 01:45.588
It's all about seeming normal.

01:45.622 --> 01:47.245
-OK, we get it.

01:47.279 --> 01:48.763
Stop nagging.

01:48.798 --> 01:50.593
-I mean, that's great, but your
family's owned this place

01:50.627 --> 01:52.215
for centuries.

01:52.250 --> 01:53.458
I don't think I could afford a
country mansion on my weekly

01:53.492 --> 01:54.390
allowance.

01:54.424 --> 01:55.460
-Well, you've got a talent.

01:55.494 --> 01:56.840
Yeah, wolfbloods generally do.

01:56.875 --> 01:59.188
-Yeah, an artist or an
illustrator can live and work

01:59.222 --> 02:00.499
wherever they like.

02:00.534 --> 02:01.983
-As long as there's a dungeon
in the cellar.

02:02.018 --> 02:03.261
-It's not a dungeon.

02:03.295 --> 02:05.228
-It's a precaution.

02:05.263 --> 02:07.472
Think of it as a rite
of passage.

02:07.506 --> 02:10.578
-Yeah, like an initiation into
our pack, because deep down

02:10.613 --> 02:13.340
that's what you really
want, being a pack.

02:13.374 --> 02:14.582
All wolfbloods do.

02:14.617 --> 02:16.308
It's greater than the
instinct to be free.

02:16.343 --> 02:18.931
-And there's no freedom without
responsibility.

02:18.966 --> 02:20.381
Not in the human world anyway.

02:20.416 --> 02:23.177
-Look, the full moon's
not till tomorrow.

02:23.212 --> 02:24.489
If you don't want to sleep
down here tonight--

02:24.523 --> 02:25.352
-Maddy!

02:25.386 --> 02:26.629
-Mum, it's his choice.

02:26.663 --> 02:29.010
-It's OK.

02:29.045 --> 02:30.219
I need to learn.

02:30.253 --> 02:31.634
I won't let you down.

02:31.668 --> 02:33.601
-Well, we never thought
you would.

03:04.563 --> 03:08.429
-Can you smell something?

03:08.464 --> 03:09.568
-No.

03:13.054 --> 03:15.229
Did the army come up here
to train or something?

03:15.264 --> 03:19.268
-I don't think so.

03:19.302 --> 03:19.958
Rhydian.

03:19.992 --> 03:20.959
-Just having a look.

03:29.278 --> 03:31.832
-Sinclair.

03:31.866 --> 03:34.283
Why would anyone hide Sinclair
gear in the woods?

03:34.317 --> 03:37.941
-Because it's nicked or fake.

03:37.976 --> 03:39.460
-It looks pretty real to me.

03:39.495 --> 03:40.599
-How would you know.

03:40.634 --> 03:42.325
You can't afford Sinclair.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.362
-Like you've got a
wardrobe full.

03:44.396 --> 03:45.708
-I have now.

03:45.742 --> 03:47.606
-Rhydian, we can't just
help ourselves.

03:47.641 --> 03:49.263
-Why not?

03:49.298 --> 03:50.678
-Uh, because we're supposed to
be keeping our heads down.

03:50.713 --> 03:52.301
Being responsible.

03:52.335 --> 03:53.681
-So what?

03:53.716 --> 03:55.994
We call the police, yes officer,
we were running four

03:56.028 --> 03:58.721
miles to school as you do on
the day of a full moon.

04:02.069 --> 04:04.658
-Taking from thieves isn't
really stealing, is it?

04:04.692 --> 04:06.280
-Exactly.

04:06.315 --> 04:08.593
-In fact, we just punishing them
for doing it in the first

04:08.627 --> 04:09.801
place.

04:09.835 --> 04:10.457
-You can't get more responsible
than that.

04:19.637 --> 04:21.571
-We've got a present for you.

04:21.606 --> 04:22.986
-Sinclair.

04:23.021 --> 04:24.609
You're going to be the best
dressed girl in school.

04:24.643 --> 04:25.713
-Where did you get these?

04:25.748 --> 04:26.956
-Ask no questions,
hear no lies.

04:26.990 --> 04:30.994
-I told you they're
up to something.

04:31.029 --> 04:31.961
I mean, I just--

04:31.995 --> 04:33.100
-We know what you mean.

04:33.134 --> 04:34.343
-Do we?

04:34.377 --> 04:36.552
-Tom still thinks we
have, you know.

04:36.586 --> 04:37.311
-Still.

04:37.346 --> 04:38.485
-No, no, no.

04:42.799 --> 04:43.697
Yeah.

04:43.731 --> 04:45.906
I'm sorry, and I was wrong.

04:45.940 --> 04:46.769
OK?

04:46.803 --> 04:48.011
-Apology accepted.

04:48.046 --> 04:51.739
-In that case, ta, thank
you very much.

04:51.774 --> 04:53.154
-Go on then, Shannon.

04:53.189 --> 04:57.987
-No, I'm sorry Mads, but all
these designer labels.

04:58.021 --> 04:59.126
They're just sweat shops.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.818
-Well, yeah, but I'm
sure this isn't.

05:01.853 --> 05:05.512
-I'd rather wear ethically
produced stuff and support

05:05.546 --> 05:08.480
smaller companies, you know,
and it's better planet.

05:08.515 --> 05:10.137
I'm sorry.

05:10.171 --> 05:11.000
It was really nice of you.

05:11.034 --> 05:12.795
-No, no, you're right.

05:12.829 --> 05:16.177
I wouldn't want to spoil
Shannon's style.

05:16.212 --> 05:17.420
-Sinclair.

05:17.455 --> 05:18.456
-Where did you losers
get that?

05:18.490 --> 05:20.492
-How could you afford it?

05:20.527 --> 05:23.806
-Well, it was a prezzy for
Shannon, but it turns out it's

05:23.840 --> 05:24.841
not really her thing.

05:24.876 --> 05:26.705
-[IN UNISON] I want it.

05:29.846 --> 05:32.124
-Whoa.

05:32.159 --> 05:35.127
-I'll give you 20 quid.

05:35.162 --> 05:36.508
23 pounds.

05:36.543 --> 05:38.027
-24.50.

05:38.061 --> 05:39.925
-I'll give you 35 if you wait
till the end of the week.

05:39.960 --> 05:40.926
-30 cash.

05:40.961 --> 05:43.653
-Sold to the woman
in the blue.

05:43.688 --> 05:45.483
-I was going to the
hairdresser's after school.

05:45.517 --> 05:48.106
And this is way cooler
than a haircut.

05:48.140 --> 05:48.831
-Have

05:48.865 --> 05:50.764
you got -No.

05:50.798 --> 05:52.731
That, that was the last one.

05:52.766 --> 05:54.802
-If you do get any more, we'll
pay what she paid.

06:05.779 --> 06:06.883
-OK.

06:10.542 --> 06:13.752
-Come on, old boy, we all know
you stole that Sinclair stuff.

06:13.787 --> 06:15.513
-Sorry, Jimmy, none left.

06:15.547 --> 06:16.030
Can't help you.

06:16.065 --> 06:16.928
-Me?

06:16.962 --> 06:17.653
I don't buy stolen goods.

06:17.687 --> 06:19.102
What am I, poor?

06:19.137 --> 06:20.414
-No.

06:20.449 --> 06:20.828
-I thought you could help
these two dorks.

06:20.863 --> 06:22.105
-Hey.

06:22.140 --> 06:24.142
I mean, have you seen
the way they dress?

06:24.176 --> 06:27.110
Market store knockoffs, jumpers
knit by Liam's gran.

06:27.145 --> 06:28.940
-You can't give back a present
from your nan.

06:28.974 --> 06:30.769
-Football team's got a
tournament next month,

06:30.804 --> 06:32.668
professional players giving
master classes.

06:32.702 --> 06:34.014
There's a dinner on
the last night.

06:34.048 --> 06:36.050
I have to sit next to
these two losers.

06:36.085 --> 06:39.088
Now, if you could
kit them out.

06:39.122 --> 06:41.055
-Maybe I could lay my hands
on a few things.

06:41.090 --> 06:42.540
-That would be brilliant.

06:42.574 --> 06:45.266
-Yeah, great, but we can't
pay what Kara paid.

06:45.301 --> 06:46.198
-Yeah.

06:46.233 --> 06:48.787
Mates rates, right?

06:48.822 --> 06:53.033
-Lads, I'm sorry, but I've
got overheads to cover.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.724
I mean, this is a business.

06:54.759 --> 06:57.520
I can't just hand out discounts
to anyone that asks.

06:57.555 --> 06:59.936
-See, that's how a real
businessman behaves.

06:59.971 --> 07:00.799
Watch and learn.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.214
-But we can't afford it.

07:02.249 --> 07:04.700
-That's the problem with you
two, you lack initiative.

07:04.734 --> 07:06.943
And if you are going to dress
like dorks, stand

07:06.978 --> 07:08.117
further away from me.

07:18.990 --> 07:20.163
-And a hoodie, right.

07:20.198 --> 07:21.682
Remember color and size
are not guaranteed.

07:35.109 --> 07:37.077
-You can't do this.

07:37.111 --> 07:38.285
-Of course I can.

07:38.319 --> 07:40.529
I'm just finding what
time to fill my bag.

07:40.563 --> 07:43.152
-Unless you get caught by a
teacher, or the thieves coming

07:43.186 --> 07:44.843
back for their stuff.

07:44.878 --> 07:46.638
-Do you remember what
your dad said?

07:46.673 --> 07:48.640
Wolfbloods have limited
options.

07:48.675 --> 07:50.746
You're all right with your big
old house and your money.

07:50.780 --> 07:52.506
-I'm not as rich as you think.

07:52.541 --> 07:54.232
-I'm a wolfblood in
the care system.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.820
I have to think about
my future.

07:55.854 --> 07:57.960
If my first step is making money
out of teenage fashion

07:57.994 --> 07:59.824
victims, that is fine by me.

07:59.858 --> 08:01.101
-Fine.

08:01.135 --> 08:03.034
But when it all goes wrong,
don't expect me to

08:03.068 --> 08:04.173
sort out your mess.

08:19.671 --> 08:20.638
-If someone catches us--

08:20.672 --> 08:22.674
-Stop whining, and keep watch.

08:22.709 --> 08:24.193
-What if Tom finds out?

08:24.227 --> 08:25.366
-Stolen goods, stupid.

08:25.401 --> 08:28.611
What's he going to do,
call the police?

08:28.646 --> 08:29.785
-Rhydian's coming.

08:35.066 --> 08:36.619
-What are you two looking
so guilty about?

08:36.654 --> 08:37.136
Don't know what you're
talking about.

08:37.171 --> 08:38.102
-Nothing.

08:59.124 --> 09:01.575
[camera clicking]

09:25.634 --> 09:27.014
Where's he getting
this stuff from?

09:27.049 --> 09:29.189
-He's going to get into
real trouble.

09:32.468 --> 09:34.435
I'll talk to him.

09:34.470 --> 09:35.678
-That's all gone.

09:35.713 --> 09:36.852
Sorry.

09:39.164 --> 09:41.201
-Look, you've had your fun.

09:41.235 --> 09:42.236
Just quit while you're ahead.

09:42.271 --> 09:43.030
-I offered you a cut.

09:43.065 --> 09:44.169
You said no.

09:44.204 --> 09:45.792
-This isn't about the money.

09:45.826 --> 09:48.277
Have you forgotten what
day it is today?

09:48.311 --> 09:50.244
You can't afford to
take these risks.

09:50.279 --> 09:51.625
-You were happy to take
stuff this morning.

09:51.660 --> 09:55.767
-Yeah, because I was overexcited
and stupid.

09:55.802 --> 09:58.045
But now I've got control of
myself, which is what you need

09:58.080 --> 10:00.945
to do, because when this all
blows up in your face, we're

10:00.979 --> 10:01.980
not going to be around
to help.

10:02.015 --> 10:03.223
-I don't need your help.

10:03.257 --> 10:05.743
All right, I've got one
last girl's t-shirt.

10:05.777 --> 10:06.398
Anybody?

10:06.433 --> 10:07.227
The highest bidder.

10:07.261 --> 10:07.779
[interposing voices]

10:07.814 --> 10:08.366
-20.

10:08.400 --> 10:08.918
Uh, 30, anybody?

10:08.953 --> 10:09.470
30?

10:09.505 --> 10:10.748
40, maybe.

10:10.782 --> 10:11.162
40.

10:11.196 --> 10:12.128
50.

10:12.163 --> 10:13.060
So it's at 50.

10:13.095 --> 10:13.716
60.

10:13.751 --> 10:14.337
I got 60.

10:14.372 --> 10:15.373
Anyone got 60?

10:15.407 --> 10:16.961
-Right.

10:16.995 --> 10:20.136
Before we get started, we've
had a call from the police.

10:20.171 --> 10:22.863
And they have reason to believe
that someone is

10:22.898 --> 10:26.902
selling stolen property
on school premises.

10:26.936 --> 10:29.318
Specifically, Sinclair
designer clothing.

10:29.352 --> 10:32.424
Does anyone in this class know
anything about that?

10:35.807 --> 10:42.089
And for once, we have complete
and utter silence.

10:42.124 --> 10:43.781
All right, come on.

10:43.815 --> 10:45.852
Open your textbooks.

10:45.886 --> 10:49.027
Page 47.

10:49.062 --> 10:51.374
-I'm so glad I had more sense
than to get involved in this.

10:53.998 --> 10:55.102
What?

11:02.558 --> 11:03.835
The police what?

11:03.870 --> 11:05.388
But we haven't done anything.

11:05.423 --> 11:08.288
-I'll decide that.

11:08.322 --> 11:09.427
Follow me.

11:14.812 --> 11:19.748
-I just wanted to know where
you got these items from?

11:19.782 --> 11:20.438
-Why, sir?

11:20.472 --> 11:21.750
Do you want some?

11:21.784 --> 11:22.820
-What?

11:22.854 --> 11:23.268
-They'll never go
with your eyes.

11:33.796 --> 11:35.522
By mail order.

11:35.556 --> 11:38.836
-So you have a receipt
or some paperwork?

11:38.870 --> 11:39.975
-Doubt it.

11:40.009 --> 11:41.735
My mummy tidied my room.

11:41.770 --> 11:43.772
I throwed all the package in.

11:43.806 --> 11:45.118
-I bet you don't have receipts
for what you're

11:45.152 --> 11:46.084
wearing today, sir.

11:46.119 --> 11:49.087
It doesn't mean it's stolen.

11:49.122 --> 11:50.779
-Do Oxfam even do receipts?

11:50.813 --> 11:52.194
I'm not being funny, sir.

11:52.228 --> 11:54.368
But do you have proof there are
stolen goods in school?

11:54.403 --> 11:55.128
-The police.

11:55.162 --> 11:56.405
They believe--

11:56.439 --> 11:58.131
-You would love starting
rumors, and having the

11:58.165 --> 12:00.098
teachers run around
in circles.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.135
You remember when they said
there's an escaped pony on the

12:02.169 --> 12:03.239
playground, sir?

12:03.274 --> 12:05.448
-Trina, that actually
happened.

12:05.483 --> 12:07.830
It kicked Jimi, remember?

12:07.865 --> 12:09.176
-Oh, yeah.

12:09.211 --> 12:10.281
Sometimes I love school.

12:10.315 --> 12:12.766
-Please just stick
to the subject.

12:12.801 --> 12:14.457
-I'm not sure there
is a subject, sir.

12:14.492 --> 12:17.495
There's no proof there is any
stolen goods in school.

12:17.529 --> 12:20.118
You can't prove we didn't
buy those legitimately.

12:20.153 --> 12:21.188
And as much as I hate
to remind you,

12:21.223 --> 12:22.327
we're missing French.

12:25.261 --> 12:26.400
-Go now.

12:33.614 --> 12:36.134
-You flog on my story
forget it.

12:36.169 --> 12:39.310
-I've come to say thanks
for not turning me in.

12:39.344 --> 12:40.932
-Whatever.

12:40.967 --> 12:43.072
-Exactly how grateful are you,
because I've still got that

12:43.107 --> 12:45.247
hairdresser's appointment
booked, and Katrina's saving

12:45.281 --> 12:47.387
for new shoes.

12:47.421 --> 12:48.319
-You want your money back.

12:48.353 --> 12:49.492
-And we keep the t-shirts.

12:49.527 --> 12:50.459
-No way.

12:50.493 --> 12:51.909
-Thought you were grateful.

12:51.943 --> 12:53.634
-I thought you were
a gentleman.

12:53.669 --> 12:56.430
-I thought you wanted to make
sure that no one accidentally

12:56.465 --> 12:57.431
said anything.

12:57.466 --> 12:58.570
Especially to Jeffries.

13:06.026 --> 13:07.165
Pleasure doing business
with you.

13:11.307 --> 13:12.377
-Happy now?

13:12.412 --> 13:13.965
-Not really.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.312
But if it makes you realize how
much of a risk you took.

13:16.347 --> 13:18.280
-Yeah, well, I won't
be taking anymore.

13:18.314 --> 13:20.903
-Better think about that again,
because we can still

13:20.938 --> 13:22.215
tell Jeffries what's
been going on.

13:22.249 --> 13:22.905
-Two against one.

13:22.940 --> 13:24.631
He'd believe us.

13:24.665 --> 13:26.253
-What do you want?

13:26.288 --> 13:28.980
-These, one each, for free.

13:32.466 --> 13:34.641
-What if I can't get them?

13:34.675 --> 13:35.918
Then,

13:35.953 --> 13:37.506
-Then, I suppose you're
going to prison.

13:37.540 --> 13:40.233
-We'll tell Jeffries Rhydian
had nothing to do with it.

13:40.267 --> 13:41.890
You can't prove anything.

13:41.924 --> 13:44.030
-All we have to do is name
everyone Rhydian sold to.

13:44.064 --> 13:45.376
Someone will crack.

13:45.410 --> 13:47.654
-If I get you each one of
these, it's over, right?

13:47.688 --> 13:48.862
-You can't trust these two.

13:48.897 --> 13:49.863
Oy.

13:49.898 --> 13:50.933
-What other choice do I have?

13:53.108 --> 13:55.662
Meet me at Bernie's at 4:30.

13:55.696 --> 13:59.424
-See, now you're thinking
like a businessman.

13:59.459 --> 14:00.598
-And don't be late.

14:03.014 --> 14:05.499
-Rhydian, you can't,
not tonight.

14:05.534 --> 14:07.053
-We've got hours
until moonrise.

14:07.087 --> 14:09.331
Just come with me
to your parents.

14:09.365 --> 14:10.642
Look, I'm going to get these.

14:10.677 --> 14:11.643
I'll meet Sam and Liam.

14:11.678 --> 14:14.025
And then I'll be back at
yours before dinner.

14:14.060 --> 14:15.682
-And I'm just supposed to
trust that you'll there.

14:15.716 --> 14:16.579
-I'll be there.

14:16.614 --> 14:17.995
I promise.

14:18.029 --> 14:19.203
It's just a couple of hoodies.

14:19.237 --> 14:20.342
What could go wrong?

14:42.088 --> 14:42.709
-Police!

14:42.743 --> 14:43.952
Stop where you are.

14:50.199 --> 14:51.338
-Grab him.

14:56.757 --> 15:00.761
-And these jeans will
go lovely with it.

15:00.796 --> 15:02.349
-Bernie?

15:02.384 --> 15:04.627
-Hi.

15:04.662 --> 15:06.422
-Evening girls.

15:06.457 --> 15:07.976
I see you like Sinclair.

15:08.010 --> 15:08.942
-Who wants to know?

15:08.977 --> 15:11.324
-Detective Inspector Bolton.

15:11.358 --> 15:13.498
Where did you get
the t-shirts?

15:13.533 --> 15:16.018
[interposing voices]

15:16.053 --> 15:17.744
-So you didn't buy them
from somebody in the

15:17.778 --> 15:20.091
street or at school?

15:23.992 --> 15:25.096
-There, we're done.

15:25.131 --> 15:26.063
-I don't know what you mean.

15:26.097 --> 15:27.133
You've got the wrong people.

15:27.167 --> 15:28.237
-I don't even know
who you are.

15:34.692 --> 15:36.694
-So will this be enough
for the night?

15:36.728 --> 15:38.420
-Well, given the lack
of meat in Rhydian's

15:38.454 --> 15:40.974
diet, probably not.

15:41.009 --> 15:42.665
I'll get it.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.116
-If that's Rhydian, tell
him to hurry up.

15:45.151 --> 15:46.359
-Hello.

15:46.393 --> 15:47.256
-Maddy, it's me.

15:47.291 --> 15:48.568
-Hi, Tom, what's up?

15:48.602 --> 15:49.362
-It's Rhydian.

15:49.396 --> 15:50.604
-What's going on?

15:55.437 --> 15:56.576
Rhydian's been arrested.

16:08.864 --> 16:09.796
-Charge?

16:09.830 --> 16:12.074
Handling stolen property.

16:12.109 --> 16:13.248
-Name.

16:16.389 --> 16:17.804
You do know we can keep you
locked up until you

16:17.838 --> 16:20.841
tell us, don't you?

16:20.876 --> 16:22.119
Fine.

16:35.408 --> 16:37.410
-It's unbelievable stupidity.

16:37.444 --> 16:38.307
-Tell him, not me.

16:38.342 --> 16:39.791
-You took things as well.

16:39.826 --> 16:41.483
-We'll deal with that
in a minute.

16:41.517 --> 16:42.553
Right now we've got to get him
out of here, and we don't have

16:42.587 --> 16:43.726
long to do it.

16:46.074 --> 16:46.453
-Hi.

16:46.488 --> 16:47.627
-Hi.

16:47.661 --> 16:48.455
-We're here to pick
up Rhydian Morris.

16:48.490 --> 16:49.180
-Young lad, is he?

16:49.215 --> 16:50.181
That's right.

16:50.216 --> 16:51.286
He wouldn't give us his name.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.390
It's a good thing
you turned up.

16:52.425 --> 16:54.496
We've had to keep
him all night.

16:54.530 --> 16:55.738
The lad's parents are here.

16:55.773 --> 16:57.050
-No, we're not his parents.

16:59.432 --> 17:01.744
-He means Rhydian's
in foster care.

17:01.779 --> 17:02.780
We're his foster family.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.367
-That's right.

17:04.402 --> 17:05.782
Mr. and Mrs. Vaughn.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.542
-Right, well, just
take a seat.

17:07.578 --> 17:09.442
Detective Bolton will be with
you just as soon as he's

17:09.476 --> 17:12.307
ready, which might
be some time.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.281
-All right.

17:22.317 --> 17:23.387
We've got Mr. Vaughn here.

17:23.421 --> 17:24.526
We can get on with this.

17:28.944 --> 17:32.223
Oh, hi Mr. Vaughn.

17:32.258 --> 17:33.190
I'm sorry.

17:33.224 --> 17:34.708
-You will be young man.

17:34.743 --> 17:40.645
-Interview with Rhydian Morris
commencing 18:20 on Tuesday,

17:40.680 --> 17:42.302
the 9th of May.

17:42.337 --> 17:45.133
present D. I. Bolton.

17:45.167 --> 17:45.685
-Don't worry.

17:45.719 --> 17:47.859
It'll be OK.

17:47.894 --> 17:50.655
-You know we can never draw
attention to ourselves.

17:50.690 --> 17:51.587
-Fine.

17:51.622 --> 17:52.623
We shouldn't have done it.

17:52.657 --> 17:53.934
I know.

17:53.969 --> 17:56.489
But if it was left you we'd
never do anything.

17:56.523 --> 18:00.700
We'd go nowhere, do nothing,
get boring jobs and live

18:00.734 --> 18:01.770
boring lives.

18:01.804 --> 18:04.359
-We are trying to
keep you safe.

18:04.393 --> 18:07.258
-There's more to life
than being man safe.

18:07.293 --> 18:08.466
-Well, let's just see
if you're still

18:08.501 --> 18:09.950
saying that at moonrise.

18:09.985 --> 18:11.400
We've got less than an hour.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.337
-Here.

18:17.372 --> 18:18.476
Any of these men perhaps?

18:20.996 --> 18:22.342
-I didn't see anyone there.

18:22.377 --> 18:23.757
I thought the stuff
was abandoned.

18:28.279 --> 18:30.937
-Look, Inspector, Rhydian
found what he

18:30.971 --> 18:33.629
thought was lost property.

18:33.664 --> 18:34.872
-Lost property.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.839
And he made a stupid decision,
which I think

18:36.874 --> 18:40.464
he now deeply regrets.

18:40.498 --> 18:41.844
-Yeah.

18:41.879 --> 18:43.363
Absolutely.

18:43.398 --> 18:46.884
-He clearly wasn't involved
in the actual robbery.

18:46.918 --> 18:50.922
And I assure you, he will be
punished for what he's done.

18:50.957 --> 18:52.683
So if we could just say--

18:52.717 --> 18:56.549
-It's not that simple
Mr. Vaughn.

18:56.583 --> 18:59.483
Rhydian helped himself to
something that wasn't his.

18:59.517 --> 19:02.624
We have surveillance
photographs.

19:02.658 --> 19:03.797
-Surely, you can't--

19:06.938 --> 19:08.285
But you can't.

19:08.319 --> 19:09.769
He's just a kid.

19:09.803 --> 19:13.980
-Mr. Vaughn, you and I need
to have a word in private.

19:17.915 --> 19:20.573
Sergeant Ashford, Mr.
Morris is ready to

19:20.607 --> 19:21.712
go back to his cell.

19:25.405 --> 19:28.028
We're not going to charge
Rhydian with anything.

19:28.063 --> 19:28.822
-Really?

19:28.857 --> 19:29.789
Wonderful.

19:29.823 --> 19:30.755
Let's sign the paperwork.

19:30.790 --> 19:31.791
I'll get him off your hands.

19:31.825 --> 19:32.964
-Not so fast, sir.

19:32.999 --> 19:35.484
Lads with a bad attitude,
they need to

19:35.519 --> 19:37.210
learn to respect authority.

19:37.245 --> 19:39.454
-Of course, I'll make sure
he learns his lesson.

19:39.488 --> 19:40.938
-No, the law says we can hold
him for another 10 hours

19:40.972 --> 19:43.043
without charge.

19:43.078 --> 19:46.530
And I find when a lad spends a
night in a cell, he comes out

19:46.564 --> 19:48.221
in no hurry to break
the law again.

20:02.339 --> 20:04.824
It's tough love, Mr. Vaughn.

20:04.858 --> 20:06.964
And sometimes a child needs
to be shocked into

20:06.998 --> 20:08.414
changing their behavior.

20:08.448 --> 20:10.036
It's all right for you.

20:10.070 --> 20:11.589
It's me that has to
do the paperwork.

20:18.078 --> 20:19.356
-Yeah, it's bad news
I'm afraid.

20:24.119 --> 20:26.846
-They're keeping
him overnight.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.088
-They can't.

20:28.123 --> 20:28.848
They can't.

20:28.882 --> 20:30.090
-Hang on, Dan.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.885
If you run now, you can
make it to the mall.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.508
-And leave you?

20:33.542 --> 20:34.750
-Rhydian's going to be in that
cell when the moon rises.

20:34.785 --> 20:35.924
At least you can get away.

20:38.754 --> 20:39.893
-That's it.

20:41.723 --> 20:44.415
You can get Rhydian out of
there, dad, if you tell them

20:44.450 --> 20:45.485
what will happen if you don't.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.384
-What?

20:47.418 --> 20:48.557
-You need to tell them.

20:58.360 --> 21:01.052
-I suggest you take your family
home, and come back for

21:01.087 --> 21:02.778
this one in the morning
I assure you.

21:02.813 --> 21:04.332
-Very well, but there's
something

21:04.366 --> 21:06.092
that you need to know.

21:06.126 --> 21:09.716
Rhydian from a psychological
condition known as clinical

21:09.751 --> 21:11.339
lycanthropy.

21:11.373 --> 21:13.306
-He thinks he's a werewolf.

21:13.341 --> 21:14.549
-Exactly.

21:14.583 --> 21:16.102
It's a recognized psychological
condition.

21:16.136 --> 21:19.519
Every full moon he gets
distressed even

21:19.554 --> 21:21.659
uncontrollable, and I'm not
talking about behavior.

21:21.694 --> 21:24.041
I mean, serious physical
symptoms.

21:26.699 --> 21:29.322
-All right, all right.

21:29.357 --> 21:31.876
If you don't believe me, you can
talk to his psychiatrist.

21:31.911 --> 21:34.879
-[aaahhh]

21:34.914 --> 21:38.814
[grrrr]

21:38.849 --> 21:40.506
-Panic attacks.

21:40.540 --> 21:42.370
Animal behavior.

21:42.404 --> 21:43.509
Growling.

21:43.543 --> 21:45.096
-[grrrr]

21:45.131 --> 21:46.408
-Snarling.

21:46.443 --> 21:49.135
Scratching at the door
trying to get out.

21:49.169 --> 21:50.895
-[grrrr]

21:50.930 --> 21:51.862
-I really don't--

21:51.896 --> 21:54.382
-Rhydian is in your custody.

21:54.416 --> 21:57.350
And now that you understand
the full context of his

21:57.385 --> 21:59.628
behavior, if he comes
to any harm in that

21:59.663 --> 22:01.837
room, it's your fault.

22:01.872 --> 22:02.976
-Inspector Bolton.

22:07.774 --> 22:09.535
-Please, release him into
my care before he

22:09.569 --> 22:11.951
does any real harm.

22:11.985 --> 22:13.608
-Winding himself up when
the moon's rising.

22:13.642 --> 22:15.126
What if he loses control
for real?

22:15.161 --> 22:17.439
-He'll do that even if
we don't get him out.

22:17.474 --> 22:18.613
-[howling]

22:25.136 --> 22:26.586
-Hurry up.

22:26.621 --> 22:27.622
Hurry up.

22:27.656 --> 22:29.520
Hurry up.

22:29.555 --> 22:31.419
[growling]

22:39.427 --> 22:40.738
-That's it.

22:40.773 --> 22:42.913
I want him out of my
cell right now.

22:42.947 --> 22:44.466
-Hang on.

22:44.501 --> 22:46.675
-We're not going to charge
him, so let's get him out

22:46.710 --> 22:48.401
before he hurts himself, and
we end up with an official

22:48.436 --> 22:49.575
investigation.

23:01.759 --> 23:03.209
-All right, take him home.

23:03.243 --> 23:05.176
-My pleasure.

23:05.211 --> 23:06.488
Come on.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.206
-Take the road through
the woods.

23:35.241 --> 23:36.656
-But it's longer.

23:36.691 --> 23:38.175
-We're not going to make
it home anyway.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.141
-But we can't.

23:39.176 --> 23:40.764
I mean, not out in the open.

23:40.798 --> 23:42.904
-But we don't have any choice
unless you can drive a car

23:42.938 --> 23:43.801
with your paws.

23:43.836 --> 23:45.113
Get us into the woods now.

24:08.136 --> 24:09.171
-We should do that
again next month.

24:09.206 --> 24:10.518
-Not a chance.

24:10.552 --> 24:11.933
-But they loved the idea,
you can tell.

24:11.967 --> 24:17.628
-I don't think it would
make any difference.

24:17.663 --> 24:19.043
-So what happened?

24:19.078 --> 24:20.044
-Nothing.

24:20.079 --> 24:20.769
-Nothing?

24:20.804 --> 24:21.632
-They let me go.

24:21.667 --> 24:22.737
-No charge?

24:22.771 --> 24:25.498
-No charge, no drama,
no nothing.

24:25.533 --> 24:26.672
We just went home.

24:31.573 --> 24:33.057
Thanks for showing
your concern.

24:33.092 --> 24:36.716
It's nice to know you
care so much.

24:36.751 --> 24:38.097
-How did he get away
with that?

24:43.274 --> 24:48.279
