Because I need you
to look after Mother.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.689
Do you understand?

23:42.621 --> 23:44.341
(WHISPERING) And you
look after your father.

23:51.363 --> 23:52.865
Watch over them.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.040
They are in good hands.

24:10.649 --> 24:11.889
Grandfather?

24:20.726 --> 24:21.898
METHUSELAH: Noah.

24:44.950 --> 24:46.691
This is your great-grandfather.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.022
Show him respect.

24:50.255 --> 24:51.598
Tell him your name.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.431
I am Shem.

24:55.627 --> 24:56.697
My eldest.

24:58.297 --> 24:59.435
Come closer.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.440
Let me see you.

25:03.369 --> 25:04.643
You're a lucky boy.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.447
I think you must have
your mothers looks,

25:07.539 --> 25:08.950
not your father's.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.219
Come tell me about yourself.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.049
So,

25:15.047 --> 25:17.789
what do you like
most in the world?

25:19.718 --> 25:20.822
Berries.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.226
- What?
- Berries.

25:23.322 --> 25:24.858
Ah, berries, yes.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.961
What can compete with
fresh, ripe berries? Nothing.

25:28.227 --> 25:29.588
Yes, it's been so long
I can barely

25:29.661 --> 25:31.470
remember the taste of them.

25:31.997 --> 25:34.568
Ah, tell me,
did you bring me any?

25:35.667 --> 25:36.907
No? Oh.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.979
I'm craving them now.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.173
Ah, well, perhaps one day.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.551
You must be tired.
It's a long way up here.

25:43.642 --> 25:44.814
Yeah.

25:45.244 --> 25:46.314
Why not rest?

25:46.812 --> 25:48.155
(BLOWING)

25:55.254 --> 25:56.699
How perfect.

25:58.857 --> 26:02.703
What we need to discuss
is not for boys.

26:04.596 --> 26:05.768
You know why I've come?

26:06.498 --> 26:07.602
Yes.

26:07.933 --> 26:09.344
Before he walked on,

26:09.768 --> 26:12.271
my father Enoch told me
that one day,

26:13.005 --> 26:14.951
if man continued in his <i>ways,</i>

26:16.608 --> 26:18.952
The Creator would
annihilate this world.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.781
So what I saw is true?

26:21.780 --> 26:24.351
All life blotted out
because of what man has done?

26:26.518 --> 26:28.361
Can it not be averted?

26:28.454 --> 26:30.798
Noah, you must trust
that He speaks in a way

26:30.956 --> 26:32.128
that you can understand.

26:32.691 --> 26:33.897
So you tell me.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.204
Can this destruction be averted?

26:38.697 --> 26:39.732
No.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.136
Oh.

26:44.403 --> 26:45.643
He sent me here.

26:47.372 --> 26:49.716
Why send me if there's
nothing I can do to stop it?

26:49.808 --> 26:53.585
Well, perhaps He simply sends
you here to share a cup of tea

26:53.812 --> 26:55.223
with an old man.

26:57.382 --> 26:59.328
So, is that all you saw'?

26:59.418 --> 27:02.092
The fires of destruction
on this place?

27:02.988 --> 27:05.229
No, not fire.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.431
Water.

27:07.659 --> 27:10.003
Water'? Huh.

27:10.095 --> 27:12.132
My father said it would be fire.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.905
I saw water.
Death by water.

27:17.102 --> 27:18.513
I saw death.

27:20.005 --> 27:21.848
And I saw new life.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.584
There's something more, Grandfather.

27:25.511 --> 27:27.422
Something I'm to do.

27:27.846 --> 27:29.086
I know it.

27:30.415 --> 27:32.122
I just didn't see what it was.

27:33.852 --> 27:35.263
New life.

27:36.622 --> 27:39.193
Well, perhaps there is
more for you to see.

27:39.758 --> 27:40.930
Did He not send you here

27:41.026 --> 27:43.199
to drink a cup of tea
with an old man?

27:47.099 --> 27:49.101
The medicine always tastes bad.

28:50.996 --> 28:52.168
YOUNG SHEM: She was
the only one moving.

28:52.264 --> 28:53.464
METHUSELAH:
Was she hurl badly?

28:53.665 --> 28:55.576
YOUNG SHEM: She had
a big cut on her belly.

28:55.667 --> 28:58.011
Mother helped
and I held her hand.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.843
That must have
made her feel safe.

29:01.506 --> 29:02.541
Well?

29:03.775 --> 29:05.345
Fire consumes all.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.853
Water cleanses.

29:11.116 --> 29:13.289
It separates the foul
from the pure.

29:13.619 --> 29:15.394
The wicked from the innocent.

29:15.954 --> 29:19.299
And that which sinks
from that which rises.

29:22.961 --> 29:24.372
He destroys all,

29:26.131 --> 29:28.042
but only to start again.

But it can be survived.

Yeah.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.919
You may need this.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.488
It's a seed.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.724
From the first Garden.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.229
From Eden.

30:53.719 --> 30:54.959
Why are they innocent?

30:55.887 --> 30:58.299
Because they still live
as they did in the Garden.

30:59.624 --> 31:00.659
Yes.

01:58:45.218 --> 01:58:46.788
Do it quickly.

01:58:49.289 --> 01:58:51.269
(SOBBING)

01:58:58.064 --> 01:58:59.634
Do it quickly!

01:59:01.301 --> 01:59:02.939
(GASPING)

01:59:17.417 --> 01:59:18.828
(SOBBING)

01:59:26.259 --> 01:59:27.829
(WAILS)

01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:48.284
I cannot do this.

01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:55.657
(ILA CONTINUES SOBBING)

02:00:04.297 --> 02:00:05.799
SHEM: It's all right.

02:00:08.702 --> 02:00:09.737
(CONTINUES SOBBING)

02:00:09.836 --> 02:00:10.974
(SHEM SHUSHING)

02:01:54.641 --> 02:01:56.143
(SHATTERS)

02:02:58.538 --> 02:03:00.313
SHEM: Hide your eyes, Japheth.

02:03:28.001 --> 02:03:29.571
- NOAH: Ham?
- SHEM: He's here.

02:03:48.554 --> 02:03:50.090
(SOBBING)

02:04:13.913 --> 02:04:15.221
You don't have to go.

02:04:18.718 --> 02:04:20.288
I don't belong here.

02:04:22.388 --> 02:04:23.958
For what it's worth,

02:04:24.924 --> 02:04:27.461
I'm glad that
it begins again with you.

02:04:32.966 --> 02:04:35.242
Maybe we'll learn to be kind.

02:05:19.112 --> 02:05:20.455
Will he come back?

02:05:24.951 --> 02:05:27.022
Some things cannot be unbroken.

02:05:35.695 --> 02:05:37.299
I have to know...

02:05:39.365 --> 02:05:41.208
Why did you spare them?

02:05:43.202 --> 02:05:45.648
I looked down
at those two little girls,

02:05:46.472 --> 02:05:48.543
and all I had in my heart
was love.

02:05:52.145 --> 02:05:53.556
Then why are you alone, Noah?

02:05:55.348 --> 02:05:57.726
Why are you separated
from your family?

02:05:59.652 --> 02:06:00.995
Because I failed Him.

02:06:03.056 --> 02:06:05.002
And I failed all of you.

02:06:08.895 --> 02:06:10.340
Did you?

02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:18.242
He chose you for a reason, Noah.

02:06:19.005 --> 02:06:21.508
He showed you
the wickedness of man

02:06:21.707 --> 02:06:24.017
and knew you would
not look away.

02:06:25.678 --> 02:06:27.885
But then you saw goodness, too.

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:33.262
The choice was put in your
hands because He put it there.

02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:37.866
He asked you to decide
if we were worth saving.

02:06:40.093 --> 02:06:43.040
And you chose mercy.

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:47.867
You chose love.

02:06:52.405 --> 02:06:55.284
He has given us a second chance.

02:06:56.542 --> 02:06:58.249
<i>Be a father.</i>

02:07:00.046 --> 02:07:02.048
<i>Be a grandfather.</i>

02:07:04.050 --> 02:07:06.428
<i>Help us to do better this time.</i>

02:07:09.288 --> 02:07:11.234
<i>Help us stark again.</i>

02:08:44.150 --> 02:08:45.390
(SNIFFLES)

02:08:54.994 --> 02:08:56.837
(SOBBING)

02:09:03.836 --> 02:09:05.042
<i>gunmen swans</i>

02:09:11.877 --> 02:09:13.356
(LAUGHS)

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:22.863
The Creator

02:09:23.856 --> 02:09:25.858
made Adam in His image,

02:09:26.225 --> 02:09:28.364
and placed the world
in his care.

02:09:29.362 --> 02:09:30.739
That birthright

02:09:32.732 --> 02:09:34.370
was passed down to us.

02:09:38.237 --> 02:09:42.708
To my father, then to me,
and to my sons,

02:09:44.210 --> 02:09:45.245
Shem,

02:09:49.282 --> 02:09:50.386
Japheth,

02:09:54.053 --> 02:09:55.396
and Ham.

02:10:03.396 --> 02:10:05.603
That birthright
is now passed to you,

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:09.072
our grandchildren.

02:10:13.806 --> 02:10:15.615
This will be your work,

02:10:19.078 --> 02:10:21.080
and your responsibility.

02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:23.253
So I say to you,

02:10:24.317 --> 02:10:27.594
be fruitful and multiply

02:10:29.588 --> 02:10:31.590
and replenish the earth.
