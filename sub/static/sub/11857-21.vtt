WEBVTT

00:08.834 --> 00:11.875
Mark my words, Lawrence, if
these teetotalers get their
way

00:11.959 --> 00:13.083
prohibition will be enacted.

00:13.166 --> 00:14.542
It'll never happen, sir.

00:14.625 --> 00:17.583
You can actually make
your own record, Francis.

00:17.667 --> 00:18.792
In shellac, right, Mother?

00:18.875 --> 00:20.750
And play it on
your own gramophone.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.500
- Isn't that thrilling?
- Fascinating.

00:22.583 --> 00:26.083
A man's libation is
sacred,
worth going to war over.

00:26.166 --> 00:28.583
The war to end all wars
wasn't enough for you,
Father?

00:28.667 --> 00:31.875
Elizabeth, please restrain our
young filly from eavesdropping.

00:31.959 --> 00:34.750
I'm 18, Father,
hardly a filly.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.792
Lawrence, I don't
know how you
tolerate

00:36.875 --> 00:38.417
Francis'
behavior
the way you do.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.291
I find her spirit refreshing,
if somewhat droll.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.625
And I find being spoken about

00:42.709 --> 00:44.208
as if I weren't present
somewhat irksome.

00:44.291 --> 00:46.125
That is quite
enough out of you.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.834
Mary Pickford's got
a new picture out.

00:51.917 --> 00:53.583
- Should we all go?
- You two go.

00:53.667 --> 00:56.959
I've had my fill of
female
histrionics for one
day.

01:00.709 --> 01:03.333
Don't frown, dear.
It makes you look so dour.

01:05.792 --> 01:07.250
Votes for women.

01:07.333 --> 01:08.834
Ratify the 19th Amendment
so women can vote!

01:08.917 --> 01:11.291
Speak of the devil.
Teetotalers themselves.

01:11.375 --> 01:14.000
(female #1)
'Votes for women.'

01:14.083 --> 01:16.083
Ratify the 19th Amendment
so women can vote

01:16.166 --> 01:18.959
'all across our great land.
'Votes for women.'

01:20.750 --> 01:22.000
Votes for women.

01:27.542 --> 01:29.000
Here we go again.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.000
(male #1)
'A woman's place
is in the kitchen.'

01:31.083 --> 01:32.792
Not rabble-rousing
in the street!

01:32.875 --> 01:34.834
You are the rabble-rousers.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.458
What on Earth
are you doing?

01:38.542 --> 01:40.041
They're awfully brave.

01:40.125 --> 01:43.083
They're an awful
nuisance
is what they are.

01:55.917 --> 01:59.000
instrumental music]

02:34.875 --> 02:36.500
Are you Detective Rush?

02:36.583 --> 02:38.000
Yes. And you are?

02:38.083 --> 02:40.125
Emma Stone.
My Women's Study professor

02:40.208 --> 02:42.375
mentioned you
in a lecture.

02:42.458 --> 02:43.834
Really?

02:43.917 --> 02:45.208
Yeah, she
tracks women

02:45.291 --> 02:47.417
in traditionally
male-dominated
professions.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.959
Says you're the only
female
homicide detective in
Philly.

02:51.041 --> 02:53.125
Well, there are two
of us now, actually.

02:54.667 --> 02:57.709
Uh, my great-great aunt
Francis Stone was
murdered.

02:58.667 --> 03:01.083
- Great-great?
- 1919.

03:01.166 --> 03:03.041
She was thrown off
the second story
landing

03:03.125 --> 03:05.041
of my great-great
grandfather's
house.

03:06.083 --> 03:07.458
"Old Money."

03:07.542 --> 03:09.750
"Grand Houses and the Families
who lived in them

03:09.834 --> 03:11.500
"in turn of the century
Philadelphia."

03:11.583 --> 03:12.834
My grandmother's
favorite book.

03:12.917 --> 03:15.166
The earmarked pages
are about my family.

03:16.208 --> 03:18.417
Now that's what I call a house.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.792
(Emma)
'It's all gone now.'

03:19.875 --> 03:21.333
The house, the money.

03:21.417 --> 03:23.000
The suspects.

03:23.083 --> 03:26.542
My Grammy Stone gave this to me
before she died last week.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.458
His name was
Lawrence Wakeley.

03:32.542 --> 03:34.542
He was Francis' fiance.

03:34.625 --> 03:36.291
And that's Francis?

03:36.375 --> 03:38.041
She's beautiful.

03:38.125 --> 03:41.417
They broke off the
engagement
just before she was killed.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.208
Grammy Stone say anything else?

03:43.291 --> 03:48.250
No, but I found this
hidden
inside the locket.

03:49.709 --> 03:51.166
I think it's a love letter.

03:53.291 --> 03:56.542
"My dearest Phil,
if our secret passion's
revealed

03:56.625 --> 03:58.417
"our lives would be
in great danger.

03:59.542 --> 04:01.125
'"We must proceed
with caution.'

04:01.208 --> 04:03.792
"Yours as ever, Francis."

04:05.208 --> 04:06.792
So Franny was stepping out.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.959
And maybe the fiance
found out, killed her?

04:10.041 --> 04:11.667
So you'll look into it?

04:11.750 --> 04:14.709
Solving this case isn't gonna
bring back the good old days.

04:14.792 --> 04:17.834
Francis' murder
haunted my Grammy Stone.

04:17.917 --> 04:20.166
She was as close to a mother
as I ever had.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.875
So you're doing this for her?

04:22.959 --> 04:26.667
- It'll be our coldest job
yet.
- Record breaker.

04:26.750 --> 04:29.041
So what are we waiting for?

04:30.458 --> 04:32.041
Let's break out the ice picks.

05:10.792 --> 05:13.125
(Lilly)
'"On June 23rd, 1919'

05:13.208 --> 05:16.625
"Francis May Stone died
of injuries caused by a
fall

05:16.709 --> 05:17.875
from the second
story
of their house.

05:17.959 --> 05:19.208
Broke her neck.

05:19.291 --> 05:21.750
Scratches on the forearms,
defensive wounds.

05:21.834 --> 05:23.834
It means Francis
put up a fight.

05:23.917 --> 05:28.000
Her family wasn't home.
No witnesses, no leads.

05:28.083 --> 05:30.375
- Pretty thin.
- The Stones were rich.

05:30.458 --> 05:32.792
Father owned one of the
largest
breweries in Philly.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.792
You'd think there'd
be
a big investigation.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.208
Unless the family
didn't want a scandal.

05:37.291 --> 05:40.000
Keep their names
out of the press.

05:40.083 --> 05:43.542
So what do we got on our
potential doer Lawrence Wakeley?

05:43.625 --> 05:45.792
Uh, just the locket,
the note.

05:45.875 --> 05:47.083
And these gossip columns

05:47.166 --> 05:49.333
the old hat squad had
in their investigation.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.375
"The setting could not
have been more perfect

05:53.458 --> 05:55.792
"for the engagement

05:55.875 --> 05:57.250
"to Miss. Francis Stone."

06:03.041 --> 06:04.792
I had this
made for you.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.291
Who is this
handsome devil?

06:10.375 --> 06:12.208
I'd like
to
meet him.

06:12.291 --> 06:14.166
Don't joke, Francis.

06:14.250 --> 06:17.041
I'm sorry. I'll
treasure it.
Thank you.

06:17.125 --> 06:19.834
I had something else
made for you, as well.

06:23.458 --> 06:26.083
Will you marry me,
Francis Stone?

06:26.166 --> 06:28.458
Oh, Lawrence, I
don't
know what to say.

06:28.542 --> 06:31.583
I do. Because our life
is going to be grand.

06:31.667 --> 06:32.959
I know just the house
we'll live in that you'll run

06:33.041 --> 06:34.709
and just the number
of children we'll have--

06:34.792 --> 06:37.625
But I don't know if I even want
to run a house or have children.

06:37.709 --> 06:39.959
Francis..

06:40.041 --> 06:41.667
'...what kind of talk
is that?'

06:41.750 --> 06:43.834
I was accepted at
Vassar, you know.

06:43.917 --> 06:45.750
But you've already
found a husband.

06:45.834 --> 06:47.667
Is that all you
think
college is for?

06:47.750 --> 06:49.291
I know you love
your books, Francis.

06:49.375 --> 06:52.250
I want to do more
than read,
Lawrence.

06:52.333 --> 06:54.917
I want to
experience
life, firsthand.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.166
I want to see the
world,
maybe write about it.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.250
Your father already gave
his blessing to our marriage.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.583
So what I want is really
beside
the point, anyway, isn't it?

07:06.667 --> 07:10.000
Francis, this should be
the happiest day of your
life.

07:10.083 --> 07:12.417
I mean, I am quite a catch,
as they say.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.834
I know you are, Lawrence.

07:13.917 --> 07:17.000
Excuse me, ma'am, sir.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.417
Both your parents
were wondering

07:18.500 --> 07:21.500
if there was any news
you'd like to convey.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.125
Well, Francis, is there?

07:30.583 --> 07:32.083
Yes, there is.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.083
Tell them I have accepted
the proposal of Mr.
Wakeley.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.250
Francis, you are going
to be so happy.

07:41.792 --> 07:43.250
I know you are.

07:47.458 --> 07:49.291
(male #2)
'Mr. Wakeley, Miss Stone.'

07:57.041 --> 08:00.542
The woman with the black
eye, here in the corner.

08:00.625 --> 08:05.583
Her name is listed as
Philippa Abruzzi, housemaid.

08:06.917 --> 08:08.583
(John)
'Philippa.'

08:08.667 --> 08:10.875
- Phil.
- 'Rush. Uh-huh.'

08:10.959 --> 08:14.875
That's who Francis's
love note was addressed to.

08:14.959 --> 08:16.041
No wonder she was so afraid

08:16.125 --> 08:18.917
of their secret passion
being revealed.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.417
(Lilly)
'Okay, thanks.'

08:22.542 --> 08:25.291
Sorry, boss. Gotta make a run.
I-I'll be back.

08:45.709 --> 08:47.041
Get up, Mom.

08:47.125 --> 08:50.000
Lilly. Wh-what
are you doing here?

08:50.083 --> 08:52.750
I could ask you the same
thing,
but I won't.

08:54.291 --> 08:56.333
Thank you for coming.
Now go away.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.291
I don't want you
to see me like this.

09:04.375 --> 09:06.125
Like it would be a first.

09:11.208 --> 09:14.417
Oh, Jackie left me.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.000
When?

09:18.083 --> 09:20.333
I haven't heard from him
in five months.

09:22.542 --> 09:24.542
Is that why you
haven't
returned my calls?

09:26.041 --> 09:27.333
Call.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.041
Let's go, Mom.

09:32.291 --> 09:33.959
Squad car's gonna
take you home.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.208
And you can't?

09:36.125 --> 09:37.542
No, Mom.

09:37.625 --> 09:40.667
Oh, right.
Your precious J-O-B.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.875
I'll come by
the apartment later.

09:53.542 --> 09:54.792
Don't bother.

10:07.709 --> 10:09.542
We could've come
to see you, Audrey.

10:09.625 --> 10:13.417
Oh, and miss the chance to get
out of old folk's calisthenics?

10:13.500 --> 10:16.709
Oh, please.
You're doing me a favor.

10:16.792 --> 10:21.000
[chuckles]
And looks like you've been
doing calisthenics.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.542
We'd like to ask you
some questions

10:22.625 --> 10:24.000
about your mother, Philippa.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.250
She worked for
the Stone family?

10:26.333 --> 10:28.208
Oh, for 10 years.

10:28.291 --> 10:30.709
Can you tell us about her
relationship with Francis
Stone?

10:30.792 --> 10:33.375
Oh, sure.
I grew up in that house

10:33.458 --> 10:36.583
till the Stones went broke
on account of Prohibition

10:36.667 --> 10:38.750
and they had to fire everyone.

10:38.834 --> 10:40.667
Your mom and
Francis were close?

10:40.750 --> 10:42.500
Oh, like sisters.

10:42.583 --> 10:45.542
[chuckles]
Francis was
a natural born teacher.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.375
Taught my mom to read.

10:47.458 --> 10:48.792
Unusual for the time

10:48.875 --> 10:51.792
women from different classes
getting close.

10:51.875 --> 10:53.709
Oh, very.

10:53.792 --> 10:57.500
Francis was a modern
girl
for her day.

10:57.583 --> 10:59.041
Very progressive.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.458
Any chance they were..

11:03.542 --> 11:05.166
...closer than sisters?

11:06.250 --> 11:07.792
Like lovers?

11:07.875 --> 11:11.000
Hmm, men love to think that,
don't they?

11:12.667 --> 11:15.583
We found what appears
to be a love letter

11:15.667 --> 11:17.417
from Francis
to your mother.

11:17.500 --> 11:21.542
Very sorry to disappoint you,
but no, they weren't.

11:21.625 --> 11:24.166
Although sometimes
I wish they had been.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.000
My mother had
terrible taste in men.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.917
Anyone you can think of

11:30.000 --> 11:32.750
maybe get the wrong idea
about your mom and Francis?

11:34.208 --> 11:41.083
All I know is my mother
and Francis did have a secret

11:42.375 --> 11:45.166
but it wasn't sexual.

11:53.542 --> 11:56.625
- Hi, Aunt Franny.
- Hello, Audrey.

11:56.709 --> 11:58.458
Will you read me
a story later?

11:58.542 --> 12:01.625
Yes, but I need to talk
to your mother right
now.

12:01.709 --> 12:02.917
About her black eye?

12:03.000 --> 12:06.959
- My dad gave it to her.
- Audrey. Go upstairs.

12:11.625 --> 12:14.458
Is that true, Phil?
He hit you?

12:14.542 --> 12:17.000
It's your fault. You never
should have taught me to read.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.875
(Francis)
'He hit you for reading?'

12:20.083 --> 12:22.917
For reading this.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.792
He hates suffragettes.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.125
- He should be arrested.
- For hitting his wife?

12:27.208 --> 12:29.625
They'd have to arrest
half the men in Philadelphia.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.125
I saw them passing
these
out getting pelted.

12:33.208 --> 12:34.917
I like how they
don't back down.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.917
Me, too.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.500
There's a
meeting
tomorrow night.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.500
If my husband caught me
at a suffragette meeting..

12:40.583 --> 12:43.000
If your husband came to a
meeting, they'd string him
up.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.875
Now that's a sight
I'd like to see.

12:45.959 --> 12:47.875
Just think if we
could vote, Phil.

12:47.959 --> 12:49.875
Men would have
to listen to us.

12:49.959 --> 12:51.667
Treat us like equals.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.625
Now that's a
sight
I'd like to see.

12:53.709 --> 12:54.834
My father
treating
me as something

12:54.917 --> 12:56.375
other than
his little
filly.

12:56.458 --> 12:59.166
We could pass laws punishing men
who beat their wives.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.875
And Audrey, she
could
become a lawyer..

13:01.959 --> 13:04.583
...send those
jackasses to
jail.

13:06.917 --> 13:09.792
It hurts
to even think about.

13:09.875 --> 13:11.291
It hurts not to.

13:19.291 --> 13:22.875
So their secret passion
was political?

13:22.959 --> 13:24.709
They were suffragettes.

13:26.333 --> 13:28.834
Opens up a whole new
suspect pool.

13:28.917 --> 13:30.375
Like all the men
who were opposed

13:30.458 --> 13:32.000
to women getting the vote.

13:32.083 --> 13:35.250
- Like Francis' father.
- Why's that?

13:35.333 --> 13:39.542
Oh, because he knew that women
were the driving force

13:39.625 --> 13:41.208
behind prohibition.

13:42.375 --> 13:45.750
And prohibition
is what ruined him.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.375
Granny Stone didn't like
to toss much.

14:01.458 --> 14:02.917
You really think
Francis's father

14:03.000 --> 14:04.542
might have killed
his own daughter?

14:04.625 --> 14:07.792
Well, if he thought
she was betraying him, sure.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.250
Seen murders happen
for a lot less.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.709
Check this out.
Sophie Tucker.

14:14.125 --> 14:15.792
She was Elizabeth's favorite.

14:18.542 --> 14:20.000
(Nick)
'iPod of 1919.'

14:22.500 --> 14:25.166
I think I found something.

14:25.250 --> 14:26.458
What?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.250
Francis's diary.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.333
"June 14, 1919.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.917
"I should be overjoyed
at Lawrence's proposal

14:38.000 --> 14:39.125
"but all I can think about

14:39.208 --> 14:41.625
"is mother
reading
to me as a girl.

14:41.709 --> 14:43.875
"How excited she was
by the words

14:43.959 --> 14:47.041
"the places described.
And how she is now..

14:48.166 --> 14:49.917
"...needlepointing
her life away."

14:51.333 --> 14:53.125
Sounds like Franny wanted more.

14:55.208 --> 14:57.709
June 15, the last entry.

14:57.792 --> 14:59.750
(Nick)
'Anything about her father?'

14:59.834 --> 15:01.917
No, her first
suffragette
meeting.

15:03.333 --> 15:04.792
"I felt like
"Alice In
Wonderland"

15:04.875 --> 15:07.458
"entering that house,
through the looking
glass

15:07.542 --> 15:10.458
"and peering into
my very own future

15:10.542 --> 15:14.250
"one where my ideas were
appreciated, not
patronized

15:14.333 --> 15:17.458
"by a woman unlike any
I had ever met before."

15:22.250 --> 15:26.000
(Alice)
'Half the legislators
are in favor of
ratification.'

15:26.083 --> 15:29.500
'And half are against, with
less
than a dozen undecided.'

15:29.583 --> 15:32.166
'And the vote is
in less than two weeks.'

15:32.250 --> 15:35.583
'So the question is how to
best
influence those undecideds'

15:35.667 --> 15:37.291
'to our way of thinking.'

15:39.041 --> 15:40.125
What do you think?

15:40.208 --> 15:42.959
- Me?
- Yes, you.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.750
Well, I just came
to listen, really.

15:44.834 --> 15:46.166
You haven't had enough
of listening

15:46.250 --> 15:48.583
to men decide our future?

15:48.667 --> 15:51.959
I.. What was the question?

15:52.041 --> 15:54.333
'How to get
the undecided men'

15:54.417 --> 15:58.041
in the Pennsylvania
legislature
to ratify the 19th Amendment.

16:00.625 --> 16:01.792
Well, maybe, I..

16:01.875 --> 16:03.792
...I think we could
picket their houses.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.458
Let them know we
know who they
are.

16:07.667 --> 16:11.166
That's very good. Miss?

16:11.250 --> 16:14.041
Stone. Francis Stone.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.917
And this is
Philippa
Abruzzi.

16:17.291 --> 16:19.041
Ah, why are you here, Francis?

16:19.125 --> 16:22.250
I saw you on the street,
standing up to those men.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.709
Fearless.
I want to be like that.

16:24.792 --> 16:26.875
A suffragette has
to be tough, Francis.

16:26.959 --> 16:29.041
Tough enough
to withstand shouts

16:29.125 --> 16:31.375
and projectiles
and even fists.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.500
Are you ready for that?

16:32.583 --> 16:34.041
I'd like to think I am.

16:35.333 --> 16:38.625
Pardon me, ladies.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.875
Francis, come along.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.500
- But, mother--
- Now!

16:44.583 --> 16:45.709
And you.

16:45.792 --> 16:48.333
I dragged her here, Mother.

16:48.417 --> 16:51.542
No one just barges
into my home uninvited.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.083
You, and your kind

16:53.166 --> 16:55.917
will leave my daughter
out of your sordid
affairs.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.250
I came on my own accord, Mother.

16:57.333 --> 17:00.083
And you will leave on
your own accord as
well.

17:00.166 --> 17:01.667
And if I refuse?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.250
Someone will be
looking for a new
job.

17:12.792 --> 17:15.291
Good day, ladies.

17:16.875 --> 17:19.375
We're not ladies, lady.

17:19.458 --> 17:20.917
We're suffragettes.

17:27.542 --> 17:30.458
This little rebellion
of yours ends now,
Francis.

17:30.542 --> 17:31.583
Or else.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.291
And diary ends there.

17:41.375 --> 17:45.125
I had no idea there was a
civil war going on in my
family.

17:45.208 --> 17:48.667
So it wasn't the dad
that had it out for her.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.750
It was mother
against daughter.

17:50.834 --> 17:53.083
And Elizabeth wasn't
the backing down type.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
You mind if we take
this with us?

18:07.125 --> 18:09.667
My grandmother used
to needlepoint these.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.834
Domestic angels.

18:11.917 --> 18:13.667
What's a domestic angel?

18:13.750 --> 18:17.625
Perfect woman, or what they
thought was one back then.

18:17.709 --> 18:19.166
See any that look like me?

18:19.250 --> 18:20.917
Single, working moms?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.667
"A meeting
of the Philadelphia Chapter

18:22.750 --> 18:25.375
"of the Woman's Suffrage
Association will take place

18:25.458 --> 18:28.500
"on June 15th at the home
of chapter president

18:28.583 --> 18:29.917
Alice B. Harris."

18:30.000 --> 18:31.834
'Well, that's the meeting
Elizabeth Stone'

18:31.917 --> 18:34.166
dragged Francis out of.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.834
There are notes
on the back, handwritten.

18:36.917 --> 18:38.250
Francis'?

18:38.333 --> 18:42.500
"A woman's first obligation is
to maintain domestic harmony."

18:42.583 --> 18:44.250
Sounds more like Elizabeth.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.333
Like she was preparing
to give Francis a lecture.

18:46.417 --> 18:49.750
Yeah, and these are
her talking points.

18:56.375 --> 19:00.000
I cannot believe you dragged me
out of that meeting.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.208
How did you even know
I was there?

19:08.417 --> 19:10.500
Did you go in my room?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.875
Search through my things?

19:11.959 --> 19:13.166
Lawrence told
me you're having

19:13.250 --> 19:14.500
second thoughts
about the engagement.

19:14.583 --> 19:15.500
Oh!

19:15.583 --> 19:18.000
What is happening
to you, Francis?

19:18.083 --> 19:21.250
Why should men have the right
to vote and we shouldn't?

19:21.333 --> 19:25.083
Because politics is a dirty
business full of dirty men.

19:26.625 --> 19:29.875
And we need to keep our hands
clean, is that it?

19:29.959 --> 19:34.000
We have a responsibility
to remain above the fray.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.750
Phil's husband beats her,
do you know that?

19:38.959 --> 19:40.333
That's their business.

19:40.417 --> 19:42.500
And there is nothing
she can do about it

19:42.583 --> 19:44.500
because she doesn't
have any rights.

19:46.417 --> 19:48.083
And what about
you, Mother?

19:48.166 --> 19:49.917
Needlepointing all night
while Father's out

19:50.000 --> 19:51.208
doing God knows what.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.291
Your father
has a business to run.

19:53.375 --> 19:56.250
And you have a what,
a household?

19:56.333 --> 19:58.166
Is that really all you want?

20:00.625 --> 20:03.583
Why do you try and hide
how smart you are?

20:05.333 --> 20:07.166
It's like you're ashamed of it.

20:07.250 --> 20:10.000
On the contrary,
I'm proud of who I am.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.458
Of this family

20:11.542 --> 20:13.834
of your father's
accomplishments.

20:16.875 --> 20:20.125
If women get the vote..

20:20.208 --> 20:21.750
...prohibition will be enacted

20:21.834 --> 20:23.625
and this family
will be ruined.

20:25.083 --> 20:27.291
Is that what you want?

20:27.375 --> 20:30.291
I want to accomplish
something on my own.

20:30.375 --> 20:32.750
And what about
my accomplishments?

20:32.834 --> 20:37.583
I've dedicated my life to this
family, to who and what we are.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.834
I won't survive
our ruination.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.500
But you can save us.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.834
You know what they're up to.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.834
You want me to spy on them?

20:54.917 --> 20:57.667
A woman's lot in life
is hard, Francis.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.542
Her choices, few.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.625
Please, Mother,
don't ask this of
me.

21:03.709 --> 21:08.625
The sooner you accept the
truth,
the better off you'll be.

21:12.458 --> 21:15.417
Now that's a mom who knows
how to lay down a guilt trip.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.834
And if Francis caved

21:16.917 --> 21:18.834
betrayed the suffragettes
like her mom wanted..

21:18.917 --> 21:21.000
Suffragettes
become the suspects.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.291
'Cause those women
weren't fooling around.

21:23.375 --> 21:26.542
Especially not with a
Benedict Arnold in their
midst.

21:36.041 --> 21:38.166
(Lilly)
'Mom. You awake?'

21:39.333 --> 21:40.500
Uh.

21:44.166 --> 21:46.834
I haven't had
a chance to tidy up.

21:46.917 --> 21:50.709
I don't have the energy I
just used to have, you know?

21:50.792 --> 21:52.583
[sighs]
Well, maybe
if you eat something

21:52.667 --> 21:54.875
it might help settle
the vodka.

21:54.959 --> 21:58.041
I feel so tired all the time.

21:58.125 --> 22:02.083
What you need to do, Mom,
is stop making excuses

22:02.166 --> 22:04.542
and start going
to your AA meetings again.

22:04.625 --> 22:06.542
I will.
I
promise.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.417
That's what you said
last time.

22:10.166 --> 22:12.375
I'm cleaning up your messes
since I was a kid.

22:12.458 --> 22:13.667
I know.

22:17.041 --> 22:19.583
(Ellen)
'Oh!'

22:19.667 --> 22:20.917
It's gotta stop.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.417
It will. I-I'm getting
too old for this.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.333
No, I'm the one that's
getting
too old for this.

22:25.417 --> 22:26.834
You think I like
being like this?

22:26.917 --> 22:29.125
Sometimes I think you do.

22:29.208 --> 22:31.417
I got a lot
of good years left.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.208
I could still
meet someone, huh?

22:36.166 --> 22:37.625
You clean up real nice.

22:38.875 --> 22:40.375
You always have.

22:40.458 --> 22:41.959
Yeah.

22:42.041 --> 22:44.291
Well, that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

22:45.959 --> 22:48.166
I'm really
going
to do it this
time.

22:50.083 --> 22:52.166
Oh, I promise, Lilly.

22:52.250 --> 22:53.875
I promise.

23:00.959 --> 23:03.166
- I'm Detective Rush.
- Lilly Rush?

23:03.250 --> 23:06.542
The only female homicide
detective in Philadelphia?

23:06.625 --> 23:08.041
(Nick)
Well, there's two now.

23:08.125 --> 23:11.208
And I'm Detective Vera,
one of the nameless male horde.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.959
Your student, Emma Stone,
came to see us

23:15.041 --> 23:16.500
about her relative's murder.

23:16.583 --> 23:17.834
How can I help?

23:17.917 --> 23:19.333
You're an expert
on the suffragette movement?

23:19.417 --> 23:21.417
- Alice B. Harris?
- Wrote my thesis on her.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.792
Well, she might not be
the hero you think she is.

23:23.875 --> 23:25.709
What could possibly
make you believe that?

23:25.792 --> 23:27.625
'Well, Alice was the leader
of the women's movement'

23:27.709 --> 23:29.625
in Philly, right?

23:29.709 --> 23:31.333
(Nick)
'Which means if
someone betrayed her'

23:31.417 --> 23:32.667
she'd have the most to lose.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.333
Who would betray Alice?

23:34.417 --> 23:36.291
Emma's relative, Francis Stone.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.333
Because her family
owned the brewery.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.166
Wanted to put the
suffragettes
out of business

23:40.250 --> 23:42.500
because of their support
of prohibition.

23:42.583 --> 23:45.333
Francis spied on
Alice for her family.

23:45.417 --> 23:48.834
And we think Alice might
have found out, killed her.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.166
But Francis Stone
wasn't a traitor.

23:52.875 --> 23:54.041
How do you know?

23:54.125 --> 23:56.208
Because I had the honor
of interviewing Alice

23:56.291 --> 23:58.083
before she died.

23:58.166 --> 24:00.041
She talked
about Francis?

24:00.125 --> 24:01.917
I have the recordings
in here.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.291
Alice had high
hopes for Francis.

24:05.583 --> 24:07.208
Then again,
she had high hopes

24:07.291 --> 24:08.875
for the women's movement too.

24:08.959 --> 24:11.500
'Wanted votes for women
in every country.'

24:11.583 --> 24:12.917
'Here's the file.'

24:14.917 --> 24:17.583
(Alice on speaker)
'I remember one girl
in particular'

24:17.667 --> 24:20.834
'who I thought was the face
of our movement.'

24:20.917 --> 24:23.083
'All heart and no guile.'

24:32.667 --> 24:33.917
Are you sure
it's wise to put

24:34.000 --> 24:36.041
the legislators' names
on the banners, Alice?

24:36.125 --> 24:38.875
They have to know
we know who they are.

24:38.959 --> 24:40.542
Isn't that what you said?

24:42.250 --> 24:43.875
Remember, Francis,
we're only as
strong..

24:43.959 --> 24:45.625
(together)
As our greatest fear.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.083
Where's your friend, Francis

24:49.166 --> 24:51.375
the one who came
to the last meeting with you?

24:51.458 --> 24:52.834
She couldn't make it.

24:52.917 --> 24:54.709
Did your mother fire her?

24:54.792 --> 24:56.125
No, but..

24:59.834 --> 25:02.166
I'm not feeling very well.
Will you excuse me?

25:15.333 --> 25:18.166
I know who
your father is, Francis.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.250
You do?

25:19.333 --> 25:21.208
I'm a suffragette
not a teetotaler.

25:21.291 --> 25:22.583
If you knew,
then why allow me

25:22.667 --> 25:23.750
to join your chapter?

25:23.834 --> 25:25.250
Because I trust you.

25:26.291 --> 25:27.417
You shouldn't.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.625
- You think you're trapped?
- I am.

25:29.709 --> 25:33.458
You're a spoiled, rich girl
living in a gilded cage.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.792
But you are also a smart

25:37.875 --> 25:41.291
passionate young woman
who knows right from wrong.

25:41.375 --> 25:43.792
A woman who would never
betray what she believes in.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.375
How can you be so sure?

25:46.458 --> 25:49.333
Because I was just like you
not so long ago.

25:50.709 --> 25:53.542
- You were?
- In over my head.

25:53.625 --> 25:55.875
Not sure what
I'd really got myself into.

25:57.041 --> 25:58.792
Not even sure
if it was worth it.

26:00.166 --> 26:01.458
But it was?

26:01.542 --> 26:04.917
We are going to change
the course of history,
Francis.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.792
How many people do you know
who could say that?

26:09.625 --> 26:12.625
This is an illegal
gathering.
You're all under arrest.

26:12.709 --> 26:14.125
It wasn't me.
I didn't tell anyone.

26:14.208 --> 26:16.959
- I know.
- What's the meaning of this?

26:17.041 --> 26:18.959
There are no laws
against a gathering of women.

26:19.041 --> 26:20.917
There's been a report
of illegal activity.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.291
What illegal activity?

26:22.375 --> 26:25.000
- Operating a bordello.
- That's absurd.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.750
You want to add resisting
arrest
to the prostitution charges?

26:28.959 --> 26:30.834
You know when I said
you had to be tough?

26:30.917 --> 26:31.875
I'm ready.

26:38.375 --> 26:41.083
If women today knew what women
back then had to go through

26:41.166 --> 26:43.583
they wouldn't take
the vote for granted.

26:43.667 --> 26:47.083
No mention in the murder file
of Francis ever being
arrested.

26:47.166 --> 26:50.125
That's odd.
Everyone at that meeting was.

26:50.208 --> 26:53.166
It's documented.
June 23rd, 1919.

26:54.291 --> 26:56.709
It's the same day
Francis was killed.

27:03.875 --> 27:05.291
(Scotty)
'Well, Alice Harris'

27:05.375 --> 27:06.750
and four other
women were booked

27:06.834 --> 27:10.125
into Broad Street
Station at, uh..

27:10.208 --> 27:13.583
..5:37 p.m. on June 23rd.

27:13.667 --> 27:16.709
Incarcerated on charges
of deviant sexual behavior

27:16.792 --> 27:18.208
and resisting arrest.

27:18.291 --> 27:20.792
Held for three days before
a judge voided the charges.

27:21.917 --> 27:23.917
Only one other woman
was taken into custody

27:24.000 --> 27:25.166
at Broad Street that day.

27:25.250 --> 27:28.291
Yeah. Jane Smith.

27:28.375 --> 27:29.709
At 5:37.

27:30.959 --> 27:33.709
A single white female
placed in a holding
cell

27:33.792 --> 27:35.458
until further notice.

27:35.542 --> 27:38.041
Exact same time.
No way that's a coincidence.

27:38.125 --> 27:40.667
Well, Stone's a famous
name in Philly back
then.

27:40.750 --> 27:42.458
Yeah, jailor might have
separated her out

27:42.542 --> 27:46.125
used Smith as an alias because
Francis was a society girl.

27:46.208 --> 27:47.667
Mm.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.542
6:23 p.m.

27:50.625 --> 27:52.291
A Mr. Smith
and Jones request

27:52.375 --> 27:53.875
and receive permission
to see the prisoner.

27:53.959 --> 27:55.291
Well,
according
to the log

27:55.375 --> 27:58.417
jailor escorted Smith
and Jones to the cell

27:58.500 --> 28:00.166
knowing how
agitated
the men were

28:00.250 --> 28:02.250
how the older one stood back

28:02.333 --> 28:05.250
to let the younger one get
the first crack at the
prisoner.

28:08.834 --> 28:10.333
(male #3)
'Right this way, gentlemen.'

28:20.542 --> 28:22.083
(Lawrence)
'Francis?'

28:24.000 --> 28:25.417
Lawrence?

28:28.291 --> 28:29.750
How did you?

28:31.291 --> 28:32.959
All that matters is
I'm here to get you out.

28:33.917 --> 28:35.583
They arrested us for no reason.

28:35.667 --> 28:38.208
I know, but it's over now.

28:38.291 --> 28:41.625
- All this silliness.
- Silliness?

28:41.709 --> 28:44.125
They hit Alice in the head
with a nightstick.

28:44.208 --> 28:45.834
(Lawrence)
'We're going to forget
about that now.'

28:45.917 --> 28:48.000
Move forward.
Get married.

28:49.041 --> 28:50.709
Just like we talked about.

28:52.166 --> 28:53.750
I don't wanna get married.

29:03.125 --> 29:04.750
(Francis)
'I'm sorry, Lawrence.'

29:06.709 --> 29:08.542
I want more for my life.

29:17.834 --> 29:19.583
I tried, sir.

29:28.417 --> 29:30.500
Are you really willing
to give up everything

29:30.583 --> 29:33.166
for this so-called cause?

29:33.250 --> 29:35.750
Think before you answer,
my dear, because this could be

29:35.834 --> 29:37.917
the most important decision
of your life.

29:39.166 --> 29:40.625
What are you saying?

29:41.500 --> 29:43.041
You've never been poor

29:43.125 --> 29:46.250
never been treated like a
second class citizen but I
have.

29:46.333 --> 29:48.917
I have, too, Father,
every time you dismiss me

29:49.000 --> 29:51.333
as though I were
your stupid, little filly.

29:51.417 --> 29:53.333
I'm warning you, Francis.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.208
Your beliefs won't
keep you warm at night

29:55.291 --> 29:57.125
or put food in your stomach.

29:58.250 --> 30:00.166
Are you threatening
to disown me?

30:00.250 --> 30:01.750
Unless you change your mind.

30:01.834 --> 30:05.959
Forswear those corrupting women
right here, right now.

30:09.333 --> 30:12.166
I can't.
I'm sorry, Father.

30:18.166 --> 30:19.542
So be it.

30:22.625 --> 30:24.625
You're dead to me.

30:24.709 --> 30:26.250
And to your mother.

30:26.333 --> 30:27.792
Mother knows I'm here?

30:29.291 --> 30:32.291
Your friend, Philippa,
told us everything.

30:34.208 --> 30:35.750
Phil?
I don't believe it.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.792
How do you think
we knew about the meeting?

30:39.250 --> 30:41.333
That can't be.

30:41.417 --> 30:44.583
It's easy to have ideals
when you're rich, Frances.

30:44.667 --> 30:46.500
Not so easy
when you're poor.

30:48.291 --> 30:50.166
As you're about to find out.

30:59.834 --> 31:01.375
Father, wait!

31:09.000 --> 31:11.083
Well, rubber meets the road.

31:11.166 --> 31:12.709
Frances couldn't hack it.

31:12.792 --> 31:16.583
Yeah. Mr. Smith,
aka Ambrose Stone

31:16.667 --> 31:19.583
bailed Francis out
of jail that night.

31:19.667 --> 31:22.375
That couldn't have
been
easy going back home

31:22.458 --> 31:23.917
to the best friend
who betrayed you.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.125
Yeah. If I were Francis,
I'd have come down hard on
Phil.

31:27.208 --> 31:30.083
Yeah, and maybe
Phil fought back.

31:40.583 --> 31:43.792
Hate to tell you this,
Audrey,
but looks like your mother

31:43.875 --> 31:46.291
Phil, betrayed
her best buddy.

31:46.375 --> 31:47.542
Sold her down the river.

31:49.250 --> 31:51.291
My mother loved Francis.

31:51.375 --> 31:54.166
She was the Benedict
Arnold
of the suffragettes.

31:54.250 --> 31:57.709
Oh! My mother
was a good woman.

31:59.291 --> 32:02.000
There's a reason..

32:02.083 --> 32:05.125
...she didn't go to that
second
meeting at Alice Harris's.

32:05.208 --> 32:07.208
Because she
tipped off the police.

32:10.458 --> 32:11.917
It was all my fault.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.917
You were
seven years old.

32:17.667 --> 32:20.792
You don't know what it was
like
for mothers back then.

32:21.834 --> 32:24.083
'Once a woman had a child..'

32:24.166 --> 32:26.291
...she was helpless.

32:26.375 --> 32:28.250
Helpless how?

32:28.333 --> 32:29.667
I..

32:29.750 --> 32:32.083
...I promised her
I'd never say.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.834
But..

32:35.917 --> 32:37.333
...she had no choice.

32:37.417 --> 32:41.125
- No choice about what, Audrey?
- The times she lived in.

32:41.208 --> 32:44.000
Well, murder's the same now
as it was back then.

32:44.083 --> 32:47.750
Yes, but being a woman
was entirely different.

32:57.834 --> 33:00.250
- How could you?
- Go away, Frances.

33:00.333 --> 33:03.333
- You tell me why first.
- You wouldn't understand.

33:03.417 --> 33:05.375
Did my father pay
you,
is that it?

33:05.458 --> 33:07.208
You think I would
betray you for money?

33:08.458 --> 33:09.792
Your husband
beat you again?

33:09.875 --> 33:12.959
I've been beaten before,
and I'll get beaten again.

33:13.041 --> 33:14.875
Then why?

33:14.959 --> 33:16.542
For Audrey.

33:16.625 --> 33:17.917
He hurt her?

33:20.959 --> 33:24.542
He said he'd divorce me,
take me to court

33:24.625 --> 33:27.333
have me judged
by a jury of his peers.

33:27.417 --> 33:29.083
Because juries are all men.

33:29.166 --> 33:31.333
And once they heard
I was a suffragette

33:31.417 --> 33:33.000
they'd take her
away from me.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.417
Never let me see
my own daughter again.

33:40.208 --> 33:42.792
What can I do?

33:42.875 --> 33:44.500
What choice did I have?

33:46.250 --> 33:48.166
I betrayed
us,
too, Phil..

33:49.250 --> 33:51.125
...and for a lot less.

33:51.208 --> 33:55.792
For safety, for
comfort,
for my gilded cage.

33:55.875 --> 33:57.709
It's a nice cage, Frances.

33:57.792 --> 34:00.125
No one can blame you
for wanting to stay in it.

34:00.208 --> 34:02.959
Alice said, "We're only as
strong as our greatest
fear."

34:04.709 --> 34:06.250
Mine is losing Audrey.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.792
I thought mine was being
disowned, but it's not.

34:11.041 --> 34:12.458
It's being a coward.

34:15.417 --> 34:17.500
What are you going to do?

34:17.583 --> 34:18.959
I'm going to
go
back to that
jail

34:19.041 --> 34:20.750
fight to get Alice
and the others out.

34:20.834 --> 34:22.125
And get re-arrested?

34:22.208 --> 34:24.917
I'd rather be
in a cage with
bars

34:25.000 --> 34:27.250
than be here
and hate
myself.

34:28.709 --> 34:31.083
- I'll go with you.
- No, no.

34:32.542 --> 34:34.291
Audrey needs you
more than we do.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.333
Be careful.

34:47.250 --> 34:49.041
I'm through being careful.

35:01.291 --> 35:04.542
My mother did
what she had to do for me..

35:04.625 --> 35:08.667
...and Frances did what she
had
to do for all of us.

35:10.083 --> 35:13.208
But someone stopped her
before she had the
chance.

35:13.291 --> 35:17.625
Someone in that house,
listening to Sophie Tucker.

35:20.417 --> 35:23.875
The police report said no one
was home but the servants.

35:23.959 --> 35:25.500
But there was music playing?

35:25.583 --> 35:27.709
Sophie Tucker,
Elizabeth's favorite.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.333
There was
only one gramophone.

35:29.417 --> 35:31.750
That one, Elizabeth's.

35:31.834 --> 35:33.959
Grammy Stone said
after Francis died

35:34.041 --> 35:37.667
'Elizabeth became a recluse,
shut herself up in her room.'

35:37.750 --> 35:41.000
'With her needlepoint...
and books.'

35:41.917 --> 35:43.500
Hmm, there's a record here.

35:43.583 --> 35:46.417
"The Market Street
Recording Studio."

35:46.500 --> 35:48.834
Looks like Elizabeth
made a recording.

35:48.917 --> 35:51.208
August 18th, 1920.

35:51.291 --> 35:53.041
August 18th?

35:53.125 --> 35:54.959
Does the date mean something?

35:55.041 --> 35:57.291
That's the date
the 19th Amendment was ratified

35:57.375 --> 35:58.709
'gave women the
right to vote.'

35:58.792 --> 36:00.333
(Lilly)
'Odd day to make a recording'

36:00.417 --> 36:02.709
especially since Elizabeth
was against the whole thing.

36:15.333 --> 36:16.917
(Elizabeth on gramophone)
'How happy you would have been'

36:17.000 --> 36:18.917
'to know that the
day you dreamed of'

36:19.000 --> 36:22.083
'has finally arrived, my dear.'

36:22.166 --> 36:26.208
'I'm making this record
so that I can play it alone'

36:26.291 --> 36:28.500
'over and over again.'

36:39.959 --> 36:41.917
And where do you think
you're going at this hour?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.083
Out, Mother.

36:43.166 --> 36:45.375
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

36:46.542 --> 36:48.834
I'm through being told
what to do by you.

36:48.917 --> 36:50.083
Or anyone else
for that matter.

36:50.166 --> 36:53.375
Except that
coven
of riffraff.

36:53.458 --> 36:55.291
Why do they frighten
you so much, Mother?

36:55.375 --> 36:57.000
They don't frighten me.

36:57.083 --> 36:58.500
Then come with me.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.959
See for yourself
what they are really like.

37:01.041 --> 37:02.458
Don't be absurd.

37:02.542 --> 37:05.542
Absurd is thinking women
are just domestic angels.

37:05.625 --> 37:09.041
Absurd is thinking we need men
to decide how we should live.

37:09.125 --> 37:12.125
Why can't you accept
that
I'm happy the way I am

37:12.208 --> 37:13.792
and you can be, too?

37:13.875 --> 37:15.291
Because you're
not happy, Mother.

37:15.375 --> 37:17.542
You're just
too scared to admit it.

37:17.625 --> 37:19.834
I am a wife
and a mother.

37:19.917 --> 37:22.125
What more can
a woman ask for?

37:22.208 --> 37:25.375
Her freedom.
Don't you want that?

37:25.458 --> 37:27.458
What you want
will never
happen.

37:27.542 --> 37:31.709
Can't you see I am trying to
save you from disappointment?

37:31.792 --> 37:33.917
You're the one
who's disappointed, Mother

37:34.000 --> 37:36.750
in the bill of goods you
bought
hook, line and sinker.

37:38.375 --> 37:40.458
I'm a realist, Francis.

37:40.542 --> 37:43.333
Hoping for a future
that will never
happen

37:43.417 --> 37:45.667
is simply too painful.

37:47.208 --> 37:49.166
So you do want more?

37:51.083 --> 37:53.542
I am happy
with what I have.

37:56.333 --> 37:59.417
I'm sorry, Mother, but this cage
simply isn't big enough for me.

37:59.500 --> 38:00.709
It's not a cage.

38:00.792 --> 38:02.583
Yes, it is,
you just can't see it.

38:02.667 --> 38:05.166
How dare you.
My life is not a lie.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.834
- Let me go, Mother.
- No.

38:06.917 --> 38:09.166
I'm happy, damn it, happy!

38:10.625 --> 38:11.542
Oh!

38:14.041 --> 38:16.250
