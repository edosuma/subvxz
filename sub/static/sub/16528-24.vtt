00:00.134 --> 00:01.934
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Ah, going away to college.</i>

00:01.936 --> 00:03.769
<i> Back in the day,</i>
<i> packing up your life</i>

00:03.771 --> 00:05.804
<i> for a fresh start</i>
<i> was a sacred ritual</i>

00:05.806 --> 00:07.106
<i> for high-school seniors</i>
<i> everywhere.</i>

00:07.108 --> 00:11.944
<i> And no one was more</i>
<i> excited to go away</i>
<i> forever than my sister.</i>

00:11.946 --> 00:13.846
Okay, I'm all packed
for college.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.547
Now all I need
is to befriend my R.A.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.716
so that I can throw a kegger
without consequences.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.451
(CHUCKLES) Well,
you're three months early.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.720
You haven't even graduated
high school yet.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.522
I may have jumped
the gun a bit,

00:23.524 --> 00:25.224
but it's only because
I'm counting down the hours

00:25.226 --> 00:27.493
until I get out
of this hellhole.
You get it.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.194
Well, I still have
three months left

00:29.196 --> 00:30.029
where you're
my little baby schmoo

00:30.031 --> 00:32.598
that I want to gobble up
because you're just
so delicious!

00:32.600 --> 00:33.532
Nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum,
nyum, nyum, nyum!

00:33.534 --> 00:36.468
Aww. Your mom-brain
is fighting this.
It's funny.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.938
There's nothing funny
about losing a child...
to college.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.541
Mom, face it.
Our family is changing.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.244
Everything that you've
come to know
over the past few years

00:45.246 --> 00:47.246
is about to be turned
on its head.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.013
Don't say that!

00:48.015 --> 00:50.315
The Goldbergs
will always stay the same!

00:50.317 --> 00:51.984
Nothing will ever change
in this house.

00:51.986 --> 00:54.253
Nothing except Lainey
leaving for fashion school

00:54.255 --> 00:56.455
and basically taking a dump
on my dreams.

00:56.457 --> 00:59.258
Okay, fine.
I acknowledge
that's also big.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.361
Erica and Lainey
are going to college.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.163
But that's it...
No more changes.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.798
Hey, Ma, can you pick up
some BiC razors?

01:05.800 --> 01:08.333
Mine's a little dull from
scraping the old scruff.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.302
No! Bad boy!
You do not shave!

01:10.304 --> 01:13.172
I gotta. My old lady,
Jackie, likes me smooth.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.406
But I'm your old lady.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.041
You know, saying that
kind of stuff was cute

01:16.043 --> 01:18.710
when I was a tiny child,
but now it's getting weird.

01:18.712 --> 01:21.113
Fine. Erica and Lainey
are leaving.

01:21.115 --> 01:24.249
My little baby boy
has grown into a gangly,

01:24.251 --> 01:26.785
deep-voiced,
furry young man.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.487
But that's it...
No more changes.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.022
Look out, everybody.
Make way!

01:30.024 --> 01:34.226
Erica said that I can
have her room now that
she's gone, right?

01:34.228 --> 01:34.927
Oh, right.
You're here, too.

01:34.929 --> 01:40.332
That's right. From now on,
it's gonna be W-M-A-R-V
playing all the hits.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.301
I'm calling the shots now,
Bev.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.535
Screw it! I give up!

01:43.537 --> 01:46.205
Nothing will ever be
the same again in this house!

01:46.207 --> 01:49.942
I'm home!
Nobody bother me!

01:50.411 --> 01:51.910
TV's mine!

01:53.380 --> 01:56.982
Never change, you beautiful,
miserable man!

01:56.984 --> 01:57.749
(GROANS)

01:57.751 --> 01:59.151
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:59.153 --> 02:03.322
<i> ¶ But nonetheless,</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:05.459 --> 02:06.391
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:06.393 --> 02:10.796
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:10.798 --> 02:13.265
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was May 17, 1980-something,</i>

02:13.267 --> 02:14.600
<i> and I was with</i>
<i> my favorite girl,</i>

02:14.602 --> 02:16.568
<i> watching my favorite</i>
<i> film franchise.</i>

02:16.570 --> 02:17.936
I don't want to
overstate it,

02:17.938 --> 02:20.105
but<i> Police Academy 2:</i>
<i> Their First Assignment</i>

02:20.107 --> 02:22.941
is literally the most
important movie of our time.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.109
Sure, it's a critical darling,

02:24.111 --> 02:25.377
but if we're talking about
laughs per minute,

02:25.379 --> 02:28.514
then you got to go with
<i> Police Academy 3:</i>
<i> Back in Training.</i>

02:28.516 --> 02:30.382
Point taken. Hey, do you
have time to stay

02:30.384 --> 02:32.351
and watch<i> Police Academy 4:</i>
<i> Citizens on Patrol?</i>

02:32.353 --> 02:35.354
Obviously.<i> Police Academy 5:</i>
<i> Assignment: Miami Beach</i>

02:35.356 --> 02:37.923
comes out tomorrow,
and we can't go in unprepared.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.625
Oh, my God!
I have a girlfriend

02:39.627 --> 02:41.293
who actually likes
<i> Police Academy!</i>

02:41.295 --> 02:42.928
You just called me
your girlfriend.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.697
Oh, balls. Did I go...
I went too far.
I went too far.

02:45.699 --> 02:50.369
I mean, no. You said it,
so I'll say it, too.
(CHUCKLES)

02:51.739 --> 02:53.105
Boyfriend.
Girlfriend.

02:53.107 --> 02:54.273
Boyfriend.
Girlfriend.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.807
Boyfriend.
A-girlfriend.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.142
Boyfriend.
Girlfriend!

02:57.144 --> 02:58.977
Damn it!
Why do you insist

02:58.979 --> 03:01.680
on ripping my heart
from my shredded pecs

03:01.682 --> 03:03.582
and punting it
into a cauldron of flames?

03:03.584 --> 03:06.952
Look, we only have
a few months left
before I go to college!

03:06.954 --> 03:07.819
Let's not waste it
fighting!

03:07.821 --> 03:11.523
But I want our Barry/Lainey
Summer of Love Farewell Tour

03:11.525 --> 03:12.457
to be perfect!

03:12.459 --> 03:13.192
And I want that, too,

03:13.194 --> 03:16.028
but this list of mandatory
activities is just too much.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.529
I mean, come on.
Look at this...

03:17.531 --> 03:18.764
Road trips, picnics,
concerts, skiing,

03:18.766 --> 03:21.767
apple picking, berry picking,
pear picking...
So many fruits.

03:21.769 --> 03:22.834
I don't want to work
this hard.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.070
(CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY)
Hi.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.306
This sounds like an intensely
personal conversation,

03:27.308 --> 03:30.676
so you may want to take it
far, far away

03:30.678 --> 03:31.543
from me
and my girlfriend.

03:31.545 --> 03:35.147
Boyfriend. Boyfriend.
Girlfriend. Girlfriend.

03:35.149 --> 03:36.715
Unh!

03:36.984 --> 03:38.617
Ugh.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.118
Look at us!

03:40.120 --> 03:42.521
Look at us closely
and know that one day

03:42.523 --> 03:45.891
you'll end up just like us,
you ridiculous children.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.125
This is getting weird
and insulting.

03:47.127 --> 03:51.196
All right. You'll see.
We're the future you,
and it sucks hard.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.598
That'll never be us,
right?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.199
Come on.
We're rock-solid.

03:54.201 --> 03:54.933
Nothing can shake that.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.936
Boyfriend. Boyfriend.
Girlfriend. Girlfriend.

03:57.938 --> 03:58.570
Boyfriend.
Girlfriend.

03:58.572 --> 04:02.140
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was official.</i>
<i> I had a girlfriend</i>
<i> who liked</i> Police Academy.

04:02.142 --> 04:05.577
<i> Life was finally looking up</i>
<i> until this happened.</i>

04:05.579 --> 04:06.578
Oh, balls.
Adam?

04:06.580 --> 04:07.546
<i> Yep. We've all been there...</i>

04:07.548 --> 04:09.414
<i> Running into your ex</i>
<i> with your new love.</i>

04:09.416 --> 04:11.950
<i> Naturally, I handled it</i>
<i> like a pro.</i>

04:11.952 --> 04:13.652
Dana! Hey!

04:13.654 --> 04:16.521
How are things
going up in here?

04:16.523 --> 04:18.957
I was gonna call.
I'm back for the summer.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.660
This summer?
That's crazy!

04:21.662 --> 04:23.962
I'm crazy! Summer!

04:23.964 --> 04:27.399
Hot times!
Fun in the sun!

04:27.401 --> 04:28.900
Camp.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.304
I'm Jackie.

04:32.306 --> 04:33.071
Hi. Dana.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.906
Sorry! Yes!
Jackie, meet Dana!

04:34.908 --> 04:38.176
Dana, meet Jackie!
Introductions,
new friends...

04:38.178 --> 04:41.913
Not friends,
just street ladies,
ladies of the street.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.015
No. You know what I mean.

04:43.017 --> 04:45.817
Well, when you're free,
we should get together
and catch up.

04:45.819 --> 04:46.952
Ketchup!

04:46.954 --> 04:48.854
<i> ¶ Mustard, pickles</i>

04:48.856 --> 04:52.324
<i> ¶ Onions</i>
<i> on a sesame-seed bun ¶</i>

04:52.426 --> 04:55.661
Welp, great seeing everybody.
Bye, now.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.863
Wait! What about
<i> Police Academy?</i>

04:57.865 --> 04:59.731
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As I desperately escaped</i>
<i> my worst nightmare,</i>

04:59.733 --> 05:03.068
<i> my mom was dreaming up</i>
<i> ways to spend the summer</i>
<i> with her baby.</i>

05:03.070 --> 05:06.438
Erica and Geoff.
So funny
running into you here.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.307
Damn it.
She's got the chalkboard!

05:08.309 --> 05:09.207
Oh, no.
I'm upset, but why?

05:09.209 --> 05:11.977
That thing only comes out when
someone wants something dumb

05:11.979 --> 05:13.445
that only makes sense
with a visual aid.

05:13.447 --> 05:16.248
Hey, there's nothing dumb
about my Cuddle Calendar.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.617
Oh, God, it's got a catchy,
but terrible name. Run, Geoff.

05:18.619 --> 05:19.885
Shield your innocent eyes!
Go, go, go!

05:19.887 --> 05:21.987
I can't!
The board's blocking us!
We're trapped!

05:21.989 --> 05:22.954
According to my calculations,

05:22.956 --> 05:25.991
you have 63 days left
before you leave this house

05:25.993 --> 05:29.961
and break my heart,
literally killing me dead,

05:29.963 --> 05:31.863
which is why I made
this schedule...

05:31.865 --> 05:33.565
To maximize
mommy-daughter time.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.234
Okay, according to
this ridiculous calendar,

05:36.236 --> 05:39.037
I'm spending
every waking second with you.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.305
When do I hang out
with Geoff?

05:40.307 --> 05:42.507
Well, you see
that little sliver?

05:42.710 --> 05:44.876
Right there
is a little sliver.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.179
Well, maybe you don't see it,
but it says "G.S."

05:47.181 --> 05:48.480
Oh, that's me.
I get Erica time.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.148
Bro, let me handle this.
Check.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.318
Okay, here. Let me draw you
a chart of my own.

05:53.654 --> 05:57.889
This circle represents
how I'll be splitting up
the rest of my time.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.424
Erica, please.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.026
I'm just gonna miss you
so much.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.995
I need to spend
as much time
with you as I can.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.997
Babe, as much as I love
your circle of Geoff,

06:05.999 --> 06:08.867
I couldn't enjoy it knowing
it's killing your mom.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.303
I'll be back for my sliver.

06:11.305 --> 06:13.338
Until then, be with her.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.340
No!
Stop feeling so deeply!

06:15.342 --> 06:16.274
It's what I love
about you,

06:16.276 --> 06:18.844
but it's very inconvenient
right now!
(DOOR CLOSES)

06:18.846 --> 06:21.279
Gah! This is exactly
why I can't wait

06:21.281 --> 06:22.748
to leave this house
and never come back.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.118
Oh, poop. We both know
you're gonna miss my cuddles

06:26.120 --> 06:28.653
and snuggies
and plubbies next year.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.621
I'm sorry. "Plubbies"?

06:29.623 --> 06:31.189
It's something
I've been workshopping,

06:31.191 --> 06:32.324
and I think
it's ready to go.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.693
(CHUCKLES)
Guard your belly button.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.027
Gah!

06:36.864 --> 06:37.929
Hey.

06:37.931 --> 06:38.830
Hey.

06:38.832 --> 06:39.798
Look, I'm sorry.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.733
Dana was my first
real girlfriend,

06:41.735 --> 06:43.535
and seeing her
took me by surprise.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.436
That's all. I swear.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.805
It's okay. I get it.
You do?

06:46.807 --> 06:48.306
Yeah. It's...
It's still weird

06:48.308 --> 06:50.609
between me
and my old boyfriend.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.578
Uh, where is he?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.080
All I see
is Ruben Amaro, Jr.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.149
casually displaying
his athleticism.

06:57.151 --> 06:58.216
Yeah. That's my ex.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.752
Wait. You were with
Ruben Amaro, Jr.,

07:00.754 --> 07:02.487
<i> the</i> Ruben Amaro, Jr.?

07:02.489 --> 07:04.790
From seventh to ninth grade.
Why?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.658
You spanned three grades
with the guy

07:06.660 --> 07:08.660
who isn't afraid to change
into his gym clothes

07:08.662 --> 07:10.362
without a towel
around his waist?

07:10.364 --> 07:11.062
This is not okay!

07:11.064 --> 07:13.331
Oh, so, you can be weird
around Dana,

07:13.333 --> 07:14.866
but I can't be weird
around my ex?

07:14.868 --> 07:16.635
I'm not worried about
you being weird.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.703
I'm worried about you two
still having a spark.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.639
I didn't say
there was a spark.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.407
It's Ruben Amaro, Jr.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.676
Even<i> I</i> feel a spark
when he walks by.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.711
Okay, is this what's
going on with Dana?

07:26.713 --> 07:28.146
Do you still have
feelings for her?

07:28.148 --> 07:30.482
Don't try to turn
this around on me.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.551
I'm still turning
this around on<i> you.</i>

07:32.553 --> 07:33.752
Okay,
you're being insane,

07:33.754 --> 07:36.288
so have fun figuring
things out with your ex

07:36.290 --> 07:38.657
and don't let me
be a part of it.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.993
Told you, bro.
All love ends.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.161
Stop!
We'll work it out.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.430
No, you won't.
You'll just end up like me,

07:45.432 --> 07:49.100
sniffing a sweater Lainey
left in my room
to remind me of her.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.802
That's Mom's.
No!

07:50.804 --> 07:53.038
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Time was running out</i>
<i> for Barry and Lainey,</i>

07:53.040 --> 07:55.340
<i> and the same was true</i>
<i> for Geoff and Erica.</i>

07:55.342 --> 07:58.076
Just look at everyone,
cleaning out lockers,

07:58.078 --> 08:01.446
signing yearbooks,
saying goodbye.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.515
Let's cherish these moments,
people!

08:03.517 --> 08:06.451
Cherish my butt!
You suck, Schwartz!

08:06.453 --> 08:08.487
Sorry.
That was uncalled for.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.922
I have a hard time
with transitions.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.658
Why are you the one
freaking out here?

08:13.660 --> 08:14.759
I'm graduating,
not you.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.295
I can't help it.
Don't you realize
this is the last time

08:17.297 --> 08:19.164
we'll ever walk down
this hallway together?

08:19.166 --> 08:21.766
Last time we'll ever
reach your locker
side-by-side?

08:21.768 --> 08:26.371
Last time I'll ever
watch your nose crinkle
as you spin that lock?

08:27.207 --> 08:29.708
Last time I overlook
that you might be gross?

08:29.710 --> 08:32.444
Okay, please stop narrating
all my last things.

08:32.446 --> 08:33.578
There is so much stuff
in here.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.447
What's with all these notes
from your mom?

08:35.449 --> 08:38.483
She put one in my lunch
every day like a crazy lady,

08:38.485 --> 08:39.351
and I just chuck them
in here.

08:39.353 --> 08:43.054
"Dear Schmoo, I love you more
today than I ever have before.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.723
"I am here for you always."

08:44.725 --> 08:45.891
Okay, that one's
kind of sweet.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.559
"Dear Boopie,
you're a perfect angel,

08:47.561 --> 08:48.927
"and Drew Kremp
doesn't deserve you.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.997
"P.S. His Mustang now
has some serious scratches"?

08:51.999 --> 08:54.232
Holy crap. She's the one
who keyed Drew's car?

08:54.234 --> 08:56.301
"Dear Squishy, I know change
is hard, but I promise you,

08:56.303 --> 08:58.904
"sweetie,
your boobies will grow
just like the rest of you."

08:58.906 --> 09:00.038
Okay, maybe I shouldn't
read all these.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.909
Wow. I should have
paid a bit more
attention to these.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.411
You okay?

09:06.413 --> 09:08.046
I'm really not.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.648
I just realized...

09:09.650 --> 09:11.650
my mom is amazing.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.518
I'm gonna miss her
so damn much!

09:13.520 --> 09:15.520
What?
She's always
been there for me.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.322
How will I survive
without her?

09:17.324 --> 09:18.523
Maybe you should ask her.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.692
Don't be mad.
I'm not here to bother you.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.027
I'm just subbing
for Senora Gomez.

09:22.029 --> 09:25.163
But I did make you these
marshmallow fudge chubbies.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.566
<i> Adios, mija.</i>
(SMOOCHES)

09:27.901 --> 09:29.568
So good.
I know.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.437
These are my last
marshmallow fudge chubbies.

09:32.439 --> 09:36.341
God, I hate her so much for
making me love her like this!

09:37.878 --> 09:39.644
ADULT ADAM:
<i> The big day was here...</i>
<i> Graduation.</i>

09:39.646 --> 09:43.615
<i> It was a time to</i>
<i> celebrate the past,</i>
<i> look forward to the future,</i>

09:43.617 --> 09:46.484
<i> and, for my family,</i>
<i> be irritated in the present.</i>

09:46.486 --> 09:47.852
Bev, stop with
the crying.

09:47.854 --> 09:51.389
I can't hear the children
say stupid things.
(SOBBING)

09:51.391 --> 09:54.659
But my baby is graduating
from high school,

09:54.661 --> 09:59.531
a day I've been dreading since
she graduated from my body.

09:59.533 --> 10:00.899
She's gone forever!

10:00.901 --> 10:03.902
Hoo-hoo!
One down, two to go!

10:03.904 --> 10:05.870
I think both
of your attitudes

10:05.872 --> 10:08.573
are very extreme
and terrible.

10:08.575 --> 10:11.276
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for...

10:11.278 --> 10:14.012
I'd like to invite
our graduating seniors

10:14.014 --> 10:17.582
to get in line
and receive their diploma.

(<i> POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE</i>

I can't believe my baby's
going off to college

10:22.623 --> 10:23.755
in just a few days.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.291
You mean a few months.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.226
Uh, sure. Months.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.795
Not on Tuesday morning
before traffic gets bad.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.265
What?
I didn't borrow my cousin
Greg's flatbed truck.

10:34.267 --> 10:34.733
So, yeah, months.

10:34.735 --> 10:38.003
It sounds like you
borrowed your cousin
Greg's flatbed truck

10:38.005 --> 10:39.871
'cause my girlfriend
is leaving on Tuesday.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.173
You should talk to Lainey.
Lainey!

10:42.175 --> 10:43.742
I didn't mean now.
Sit down!

10:43.744 --> 10:45.577
What is this about you
leaving in a few days?

10:45.579 --> 10:49.881
Mr. Goldberg,
could you please not interrupt
our joyous ceremony?

10:49.883 --> 10:53.318
Oh, God. He knows I'm
leaving early for Savannah.
How does he know?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.153
I'm sorry, baby!
He got it out of me!

10:55.155 --> 10:56.621

Dang it!

10:56.623 --> 10:58.790
If you're not graduating,
take a seat!

10:58.792 --> 11:00.825
Oh, crap!
He's on the move!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.627
He's coming over.
What do I do?

11:02.629 --> 11:03.094
I don't know, man.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.797
I got a really deep emotional
thing with my mommy going on.

11:05.799 --> 11:06.898
I'm, like,
not okay in the head.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.401
Dude, how could you leave
early and not tell me?

11:09.403 --> 11:12.737
I'll explain everything
when the time is right,
which is not now!

11:12.739 --> 11:15.874
No! No way!
Do not walk away from me.

11:15.876 --> 11:16.408
I'm not walking away.

11:16.410 --> 11:19.277
I'm slowly and deliberately
marching to receive
my diploma.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.280
Joyce Basilone.
Congratulations.

11:22.282 --> 11:26.451
Mr. Goldberg, you are not
part of the processional.

11:26.453 --> 11:26.885
Do not process!

11:26.887 --> 11:30.755
This was supposed to be
our Barry/Lainey
Summer of Love Farewell Tour!

11:30.757 --> 11:31.289
Now it's done!

11:31.291 --> 11:32.857
I was gonna tell you
at the graduation party

11:32.859 --> 11:33.925
'cause I didn't want to
ruin today,

11:33.927 --> 11:36.161

you're doing right now!

Maybe it's best
I'm leaving early.

Maybe it is!

I'm very happy.

You're not the only one
whose life is crumbling,

right along to...

No.

Pass.

You can't pass.

with that diploma.
You take this!

No! Fight it!
Fight that diploma!

12:15.335 --> 12:16.835

moment for you!

to start!

No! Get away from me!
It's one of the rules!

Sorry. I slept in.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.782

her Bat Mitzvah yet?

12:30.784 --> 12:31.850

Get out of here!

12:31.852 --> 12:33.718

How could Jackie
date Ruben Amaro, Jr.

and not even tell me?

Yeah. I guess.

your watch instead of
laughing hysterically

Bubba Smith is.
What's going on?

12:57.377 --> 12:59.043
I don't get it.
This is part 5.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.746
Shouldn't they have
graduated the Academy
after the first one?

13:01.748 --> 13:04.048
I think the problem is
you're focusing on logic,

13:04.050 --> 13:06.050
not the lovable cast
of characters.

stop a jewel thief
by making weird mouth noises?

That's Michael Winslow.
He's a national treasure.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.395

<i> Dana was my past love,</i>
<i> but Jackie was the future</i>

13:24.771 --> 13:25.436
<i> and I had to get her back.</i>

<i> end it with Dana</i>
<i> and break her poor heart.</i>

13:29.109 --> 13:30.575
Okay, what's going on?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.410
Look, I've been wrestling
with these emotions

13:32.412 --> 13:35.246
much like Hightower
wrestled that alligator.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.415
And just as Steve Guttenberg
had to move on

...I misread
this entire situation.

if you thought that...
Don't be.

13:56.269 --> 13:59.070
It was really great

with the whistle!

"Insufficient credits.
See Coach Mellor"?

14:25.031 --> 14:27.298
What does that mean?
Somebody say something.

Mellor always said
that if I skipped
too much gym,

14:30.036 --> 14:31.202
I wouldn't get my diploma.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.136

one last, final time.

I take it you read that
little note I left for Erica.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.760
All right, let's tango.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.895
She's not coming.
It's just me.

15:30.897 --> 15:31.863
But I kind of
need her here.

15:31.865 --> 15:34.666
I had a big, angry speech
meant to guilt and shame her

15:34.668 --> 15:36.868
for missing my class
27 times this year.

15:36.870 --> 15:40.171
This is an outrage.
You have no right
to target her...

15:40.173 --> 15:43.141
27 times?
Wow. That's a lot.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.842
And she forged
a doctor's note

15:44.844 --> 15:48.546
saying she couldn't
run or jump because
of "lady problems."

15:48.548 --> 15:52.684
How dare you accuse her
of forgery when you're...

15:52.686 --> 15:54.452
"Dr. Edmund T. Doctorman."

15:54.454 --> 15:57.155
Oh, come on.
I warned her
for three years...

15:57.157 --> 15:58.823
Fail gym, pay the price.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.291
Okay, she's still
a wonderful girl,

16:00.293 --> 16:04.495
and I will stop at nothing
until you give me
that diploma.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.197
Ugh. Here you go.

16:06.766 --> 16:07.699
That's it?
Brace yourself.

16:07.701 --> 16:10.635
Ready to have your mind blown?
I have no real power.

16:10.637 --> 16:14.272
My greatest weapon is
threatening the kids
with failing gym.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.674
So, every year, I terrify
the attractive, popular kids

16:16.676 --> 16:19.744
to let them know that their
actions have consequences,

16:19.746 --> 16:21.879
even though
they really, really don't.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.815
Oh, I'm sorry.
(SIGHS)

16:23.817 --> 16:26.217
Do you want me to call Erica
and bring her in here?

16:26.219 --> 16:28.453
Eh, the moment's gone.
(SIGHS)

16:28.788 --> 16:31.889
You raised an amazing woman,
Beverly Goldberg.

16:31.891 --> 16:34.392
It's been a pleasure
doing battle with you.

16:35.028 --> 16:35.560
Pleasure's been mine.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.429
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Turns out my mom didn't</i>
<i> need to fight after all.</i>

16:38.431 --> 16:40.665
<i> As for Barry,</i>
<i> he was just plain devastated</i>

16:40.667 --> 16:43.067
<i> after his graduation fight</i>
<i> with Lainey.</i>

16:43.069 --> 16:43.501
Wow.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.137
You're really clutching
your Wrestling Buddy there.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.805
You only do that
when you're super sad.

16:47.807 --> 16:52.377
Lainey's never gonna
forgive me for spazzing up
her graduation.

16:52.379 --> 16:55.113
Her dad said she's not even
coming to Erica's party.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.382
Oh, God, I've never
seen you this bad.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.852
Well, I may not be able
to fix things with Lainey,

17:00.854 --> 17:04.255
but I think I know a way
to at least make you smile.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.223

17:05.225 --> 17:06.991
<i> Police Academy 5?</i>

17:06.993 --> 17:08.126

17:08.128 --> 17:09.627

your heartache.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.497
Balls, balls.
It's Jackie.
Let's get out of here.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.532
Wait. She's seeing this thing
by herself,

17:14.534 --> 17:15.400
and you just want to
walk away?

17:15.402 --> 17:17.835
<i> ¶ I know just where</i>
<i> to find the answers</i>
What about you?

17:17.837 --> 17:22.140
<i> ¶ And I know just how to lie</i>
I'll be fine.
You've found your nerd-mate.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.074
Now go.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.177
<i> ¶ I know just</i>
<i> how to fake it</i>

17:26.179 --> 17:28.479
<i> ¶ And I know</i>
<i> just how to scheme</i>

17:28.481 --> 17:30.114
Is this seat taken?

17:30.617 --> 17:31.449
Well, look who it is.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.784
I know it seems like
I'm stalking you,

17:32.786 --> 17:34.685
but this is a legit
coincidence,

17:34.687 --> 17:40.258
which makes me think I was
a huge idiot, and I'm sorry.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.025
What about Dana?

17:41.027 --> 17:44.062
She was my first girlfriend,
and she'll always be,

17:44.064 --> 17:45.863
but that doesn't mean
she's the one.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.632
Just sit your butt
down already.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.768
<i> ¶ And I know when</i>
<i> to let you lose</i>

17:51.037 --> 17:53.571
<i> ¶ And I know the night</i>

17:53.573 --> 17:54.072
Boyfriend.

17:57.110 --> 17:57.475
Girlfriend.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.378
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And so we decided to let go</i>
<i> of our romantic pasts</i>

18:00.380 --> 18:01.646
<i> and just live</i>
<i> in the moment.</i>

18:01.648 --> 18:03.815
<i> As for my mom,</i>
<i> she was ready to make sure</i>

18:03.817 --> 18:06.317
<i> Erica didn't put</i>
<i> her future on hold.</i>

18:06.319 --> 18:08.519
Hey, love bug.
Whatcha doin'?

18:08.521 --> 18:09.287
Unpacking.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.256
<i> ¶ And I know</i>
<i> the ways to fame</i>
Listen...

18:12.459 --> 18:18.429
...you know it's my dream
for you to always be
my little baby chicken.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.598
Don't say "but."
But...

18:20.600 --> 18:25.103
...as scary as it is,
I think we both know
it's time for you to go.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.872
My diploma?
Oh, no. What did you do
to Coach Mellor?

18:27.874 --> 18:30.608
Actually, even he knows
it's time for you to move on.

18:30.610 --> 18:34.178
For the last four years,
I've made fun of you
for dreading this day.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.881
<i> ¶ Out of nothing at all</i>
And now it's here.

18:36.883 --> 18:40.718
<i> ¶ Out of nothing at all</i>
And I'm more scared
than you ever were.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.787
<i> ¶ Out of nothing at all</i>
But you should know,

18:42.789 --> 18:46.557
no matter where you are
or what you're doing

18:46.693 --> 18:48.493
(VOICE BREAKING)
I will always fight for you

18:48.495 --> 18:50.561
in an embarrassing
and inappropriate way.

18:50.563 --> 18:54.365
<i> ¶ Out of nothing at all</i>
You're gonna change the world,
Erica Goldberg.

18:54.367 --> 18:58.436
<i> ¶ Out of nothing at all</i>
And you're gonna visit...
a lot.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.706
ADULT ADAM:<i> In the end,</i>
<i> sometimes we need</i>
<i> that little push</i>

19:01.708 --> 19:04.108
<i> to get us</i>
<i> where we're meant to go.</i>

19:04.110 --> 19:06.010
<i> And sometimes</i>

19:06.012 --> 19:08.479
<i> ...and we struggle to accept</i>
<i> the bumps along the way,</i>

19:08.481 --> 19:10.348
<i> but it's the people</i>
<i> you love most...</i>

19:10.350 --> 19:12.750
<i> ...that can help you</i>
<i> get through it.</i>

19:12.752 --> 19:14.152
Sorry, I'm late.
BARRY: Lainey.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.354
I didn't think
you'd ever talk to me again,

19:16.356 --> 19:18.422
you know, after ruining
your graduation

19:18.424 --> 19:21.526
and embarrassing you in front
of everyone you've ever known.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.394
Yeah, that was bad.
It wasn't great.

19:23.396 --> 19:23.995
It was basically the worst.

19:23.997 --> 19:27.498
Well... I don't blame you
if you hate me forever.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.401
<i> ¶ And I can make all your</i>
<i> demons be gone</i>
Hate you?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.336
After everything
we've been through,

19:32.338 --> 19:35.039
all those memories,
the best moments of my life?

19:35.041 --> 19:36.507
I could never hate you.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.009
We really had
some good times, huh?

19:38.011 --> 19:40.578
<i> ¶ And I'm never gonna</i>
<i> make it...</i>
We had some great times.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.646
(CHUCKLES)
And you know what?

19:41.648 --> 19:45.116
<i> ¶ Making love</i>
This is the spot where we had
our first real conversation.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.384
<i> ¶ Out of nothing at all</i>
Yep.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.718
I threw that party,
made an ass of myself...

19:47.720 --> 19:51.622
<i> ¶ Out of nothing at all</i>
...and you were the only one
who was there for me.

19:51.624 --> 19:55.826
<i> ¶ Out of nothing at all</i>
God, so much has changed
since then.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.529
I mean, not everything.
(CHUCKLES)

19:58.531 --> 20:01.365

I knew I loved you.

20:01.367 --> 20:01.866
<i> ¶ Making love</i>

20:20.220 --> 20:21.385
Your sister's

20:21.387 --> 20:25.356
I've known you my whole life,

there's...

no one like you.
