37:39.735 --> 37:42.303
But I'm telling you,

37:42.347 --> 37:45.132
I am willing to put aside
whatever...

37:45.175 --> 37:48.483
you know, this is,

37:48.527 --> 37:52.574
because I think what
we're doing with this campaign

37:52.618 --> 37:55.577
is incredible and
I think it's really special.

37:55.621 --> 38:00.103
And... if you can't see that,

38:00.147 --> 38:03.324
then that's fine,
I'll walk away.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.503
Okay, cool.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.636
No, Kat, wait, um.

38:10.679 --> 38:14.596
Do you want to sit?

38:14.640 --> 38:17.817
Yeah, okay.

38:17.860 --> 38:20.733
(EXHALES)

38:20.776 --> 38:25.346
Kat, you are so
comfortable with who you are.

38:25.390 --> 38:29.176
You get in people's faces.
You don't apologize for it.

38:29.219 --> 38:31.178
Neither do you.

38:31.221 --> 38:33.485
I wish that were true.

38:38.359 --> 38:42.624
The first time I kissed a girl,
I was 17.

38:42.668 --> 38:47.368
And it was electric.
And it was terrifying.

38:47.412 --> 38:52.373
So I didn't do it again
until senior year of college.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.637
And by then, it was
really scary 'cause I knew

38:55.681 --> 38:59.467
this was what I wanted.

39:01.556 --> 39:04.559
And I don't want to want it.

39:04.603 --> 39:06.431
What do you mean?

39:06.474 --> 39:08.191
Well, you know,
not everyone's like you, Kat.

39:08.215 --> 39:12.306
It's complicated. I... I...

39:12.350 --> 39:15.657
I don't want to go there.

39:15.701 --> 39:17.529
And we'd be spending
a lot of time together.

39:17.572 --> 39:20.662
I... I can't.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.272
Okay.
