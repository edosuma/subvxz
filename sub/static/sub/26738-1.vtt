Yeah, I think so.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.208
I mean it's just like,

00:43.210 --> 00:45.343
if people did what
they wanted to do

00:45.345 --> 00:47.312

it didn't hurt anyone,

00:48.348 --> 00:50.015
it shouldn't be a problem.

about the clit?

on South Park.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.422
Alright, so like nothing?

00:57.424 --> 01:00.392
Well it's call the clitoris

01:00.394 --> 01:04.729
and it's actually the only
part of the human body

01:04.730 --> 01:08.433
that's designed and functioned
purely for pleasure.

01:08.435 --> 01:13.505

a girl to cum over and over

01:14.575 --> 01:15.774

can master the clitoris,

like set for life.

- I don't know.
- When you were carrying him?

35:38.203 --> 35:43.272
No, I think I just hoped that

35:44.943 --> 35:49.979
it would be you know,
Chachis's, Eric's,

35:49.981 --> 35:53.416
someone who I'd loved,

35:57.122 --> 35:58.788
and it's this.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.762
It's like-- I feel like every
cell in his little body

36:05.764 --> 36:07.296
carries that moment.

36:09.334 --> 36:12.835
I know that he will
grow into his own person

36:12.837 --> 36:14.470
and he needs time for that.

36:14.472 --> 36:16.372
And you need to love him--
What kind of person

36:16.374 --> 36:19.108
- can he grow into?
- And give him--

36:19.110 --> 36:22.145
- A monster like his father?
- You got to

36:22.147 --> 36:25.815
set an example,
you're all he has.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.450
I don't know where
your family is,

36:27.452 --> 36:32.355

I don't want to talk

36:32.357 --> 36:34.624
about this anymore.

36:34.626 --> 36:38.461

but it doesn't get better.

36:38.463 --> 36:41.531
Each day it seems to get worse
with you

36:41.533 --> 36:45.068
and you are too young and he is
too young.

36:45.070 --> 36:48.805
You've gotta get out there
and have some sort of life

36:48.807 --> 36:50.373
or at least help me.

36:52.977 --> 36:54.644
I can't bring him up

36:56.715 --> 36:58.514
and I can't be here all the time

36:58.516 --> 37:00.950
and I'm actually really
worried about him.

37:41.526 --> 37:44.460
You need to chill
out a little bit.

Hey.

37:46.297 --> 37:48.364
She's always the
one starting it.

37:49.534 --> 37:54.504
It doesn't really matter,
just try and tone it down,

37:54.506 --> 37:55.371
you know?

37:57.275 --> 38:00.343
Just a little bit, what are
you guys fighting about anyway?

38:00.345 --> 38:02.445
She thinks that every
time I leave the house

38:02.447 --> 38:05.348
I'm out fucking some
other girl, she's stupid.

38:06.317 --> 38:08.651

38:08.653 --> 38:11.287
you leave for hours at a time,

38:11.289 --> 38:13.189

hell you're doing?

38:14.492 --> 38:15.391
Come here, come here.

38:16.995 --> 38:21.297
You know, if you had a
job that you're going to

38:21.299 --> 38:23.132
then we would know
where you were

38:23.134 --> 38:28.171
but she doesn't know and
she's here stuck with a kid

38:30.175 --> 38:34.010
and feeling insecure, you know?

38:34.012 --> 38:35.444
Yeah.

38:35.446 --> 38:39.081
Which is difficult for her.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.349
Come here, baby.

38:42.787 --> 38:46.022
God, look at this guy.

38:47.959 --> 38:52.762
He's so cute, but looking
at this baby's eyes.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.564
He looks exactly like Tom.

38:54.566 --> 38:57.900
It's kinda terrifying, I
mean he's just a little boy

38:59.137 --> 39:04.207
and he's so sweet, but then
sometimes when he looks at you--

39:04.609 --> 39:05.541
- Yeah.
- Don't you get that feeling?

39:05.543 --> 39:06.843
- Yeah, exactly.
- And then it's

39:06.845 --> 39:08.511
really hard on his mom too.

39:08.513 --> 39:11.280
- Yeah.
- Really hard on her.

39:12.283 --> 39:13.883
Is that why she's never here?

39:15.820 --> 39:17.019
Yeah.

39:19.324 --> 39:21.958
She's mainly in her room.

39:24.562 --> 39:26.329
She takes a lot of naps.

39:28.333 --> 39:31.067
I don't know, she just can't
deal with it day to day.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.768
- I know.
- After what happened.

39:34.772 --> 39:37.373
I don't think she's
talking to many people.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.609
She just seems really out of it.

39:42.347 --> 39:44.180
She's gonna have to figure
out what she's gonna do,

39:44.182 --> 39:46.816
but she's gotta get better
before she can do it.

39:47.986 --> 39:50.253

her even to go to the store

39:50.255 --> 39:51.587
and talk to anyone.

39:52.624 --> 39:55.524
Much less trying to
get her to interview

39:55.526 --> 40:00.096
or looking for something
to do, I don't know.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.065
I thought I could help her,

40:02.066 --> 40:04.033
but I don't know if I'm
doing a damn bit of good.

40:04.035 --> 40:07.236
And somebody needs to start
working in this house.

40:09.340 --> 40:10.172

I'm trying to get a job.

40:17.448 --> 40:18.447

- There's just

40:18.449 --> 40:20.449
really none here.

40:20.451 --> 40:21.350
I know.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.754
But if you talk to that guy,

40:24.756 --> 40:26.989
I know it's not the kind of work
you want

40:27.859 --> 40:29.558
but I think he'll hire you.

40:30.662 --> 40:35.731
'Cause I'm down to the dregs in
my savings

40:36.634 --> 40:38.134

40:38.136 --> 40:40.670
there arguing in that trailer
all the time

40:40.672 --> 40:43.372

Jesus if they just

40:43.374 --> 40:46.375
were out looking for work,
You know?

But then the kids would
always have to be with you.

full time work in this town.

can get you on that crew.

pussy it would just tickle me

addicted to it.
