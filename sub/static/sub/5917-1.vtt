THE TRIAL OF VIVIANE AMSALEM

02:46.624 --> 02:49.751
I'm sad to say, Your Honor,
that the husband, Elisha Amsalem,

02:49.919 --> 02:53.130
has refused to come to court
and to cooperate.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.132
We don't even know his position

02:55.300 --> 02:59.428
on my client's request
for a divorce.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.306
She filed three years ago
and hasn't lived at home since.

03:02.473 --> 03:05.184
For three years her husband
has kept silent

03:05.351 --> 03:09.104
except once, when he visited her
after her brother's death.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.148
What did he say then?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.233
He asked her to come home.

03:13.401 --> 03:16.862
- What was her response?
- She asked him for a divorce.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.907
Mr. Amsalem,
don't you have an advocate?

03:23.077 --> 03:24.286
No, Your Honor.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.580
Would you like to grant her
a divorce?

03:26.748 --> 03:27.664
No, Your Honor.

03:27.957 --> 03:31.251
This woman has not lived at home
for three years.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.586
Yes, Your Honor.

03:32.754 --> 03:36.423
- Are you willing to take her back?
- Yes, Your Honor.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.384
Do you suspect her of adultery?

03:42.263 --> 03:44.973
- I can't hear you, sir.
- No, Honorable Rabbi.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.601
- Your Honor...
- Silence, please.

03:47.977 --> 03:50.604
Are you sure about this?

03:53.149 --> 03:54.483
Yes, Your Honor.

03:55.109 --> 03:58.153
Why don't you want to grant
this woman a divorce?

04:00.198 --> 04:03.492
Viviane, come home, I beg you.
There's nothing out there...

04:03.660 --> 04:05.661
We speak Hebrew in this court.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.704
We must understand!

04:07.872 --> 04:10.123
Come, let's forgive and forget.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.752
The kids want you back, too.
Come home, Viviane.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.545
We'll start all over.

04:15.713 --> 04:18.714
She seems faithful.
She doesn't want him anymore.

04:18.882 --> 04:20.716
Translate, don't interpret.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.971
The children want her back.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.640
Have all the kids left home?

04:26.808 --> 04:29.810
All but the youngest,
who lives with his father.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.436
And his mother abandoned him.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.606
She sees him every day
and cooks him meals,

04:34.774 --> 04:38.235
which her sister-in-law brings
when the father's not home.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.195
And who takes care of this woman?

04:40.363 --> 04:45.784
My client lives with her brother
and his wife as well as her sister--

04:45.952 --> 04:47.828
They can all attest to her decency.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.832
How has your client supported herself
since she left home?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.961
My client has had a profession,
for over 20 years now.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.587
She's a hairdresser.

04:57.755 --> 05:01.133
Has her husband supported her
since she left home?

05:01.301 --> 05:05.387
No, my client has supported herself,
and her children, by herself.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.515
- So she's demanding alimony?
- No.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.809
- So what does she want?
- A divorce.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.186
Your Honors, she wants a divorce.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.274
Mr. Amsalem, why are you refusing?

05:17.692 --> 05:18.692
Your Honor,
as you can see--

05:18.860 --> 05:22.779
Quiet, please!
The question wasn't addressed to you.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.741
Mr. Amsalem, answer the question.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.874
Never, Viviane.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.418
Never, Viviane.

05:37.587 --> 05:41.590
Did the husband beat his wife
or treat her violently?

05:41.758 --> 05:44.259
It depends on
what you mean by violence.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.888
If you mean physical violence,
he didn't harm her.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.350
He didn't harm her.
Did he provide for all her needs?

05:51.517 --> 05:53.393
- That's debatable.
- Don't be smart.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.730
Did he provide her with money, food?

05:56.898 --> 05:59.232
My client lives separately.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.861
Does the husband fool around?
Commit adultery?

06:03.029 --> 06:04.613
No, Your Honor.

06:05.156 --> 06:09.117
Does the husband have a deformation
that repels the woman?

06:09.285 --> 06:10.452
No, Your Honor.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.705
Did the husband threaten
his wife in any way?

06:13.873 --> 06:17.250
Is the woman's life in danger somehow?

06:17.418 --> 06:20.420
As I said, he hasn't spoken
with her for three years now.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.422
For better or worse.

06:22.590 --> 06:25.258
They haven't spoken for three years?

06:25.676 --> 06:29.429
She won't speak to me,
I want to speak with her.

06:32.683 --> 06:36.728
- So what are the grounds for divorce?
- She doesn't love him anymore.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.481
- No grounds for divorce.
- They don't live together.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.609
Rabbi De Medina ruled:
that 18 months apart

06:42.777 --> 06:44.236
are grounds for divorce.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.029
- There are grounds.
- No grounds.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.949
That's an opinion, not a ruling.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.325
Rule for "Reconciliation."

06:50.493 --> 06:51.785
Sir,

06:51.953 --> 06:55.455
are you willing to take
this woman back

06:55.832 --> 06:58.041
and give her another chance

06:58.209 --> 07:01.294
to be a faithful wife and mother?

07:01.921 --> 07:03.547
Yes, Your Honor.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.551
I'm not going back.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.928
I'm not going back.

07:10.721 --> 07:11.972
We'll see about that.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.808
He said, "We'll see about that."

07:18.980 --> 07:20.397
Viviane Amsalem,

07:20.565 --> 07:23.400
for three years
you've lived away from home,

07:23.568 --> 07:25.235
and he wants you back.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.696
I suggest you go home.

07:27.864 --> 07:32.617
Please, try your very best
to save your marriage and family,

07:32.785 --> 07:36.204
and with God's help,
we won't see you here again.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.331
This hearing is adjourned.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.504
Haim, see the couple out, please.

07:45.923 --> 07:49.468
Advocate Carmel Ben Tovim,
next time wear a skullcap.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.891
What's the next case?

07:57.685 --> 08:00.520
SIX MONTHS LATER

08:12.492 --> 08:13.742
Come here, please.

08:14.368 --> 08:15.285
Come in.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.246
Come in.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.042
Bring the husband in, too.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.962
- He's late.
- We've no time to waste.

08:26.130 --> 08:29.090
Let the next couple in
and you two wait outside.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.719
We fear that my client's husband
won't come.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.638
Then why did you come?

08:34.804 --> 08:37.933
Two days ago,
the husband said he'd come.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.477
But later that day,
he decided not to.

08:40.645 --> 08:44.689
The next day, he said he'd come
and then cancelled again.

08:44.857 --> 08:45.815
Impossible to predict.

08:46.692 --> 08:50.278
Why did you come
if the husband said he wouldn't?

08:51.280 --> 08:53.406
My client thought
he was just threatening.

08:54.825 --> 08:58.328
We'll wait a few minutes,
perhaps he'll come.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.955
Wait outside, please.

09:01.749 --> 09:02.707
Thank you.

09:03.626 --> 09:07.003
Did your client
return to her husband?

09:07.171 --> 09:09.923
- Yes. For three months.
- And?

09:10.299 --> 09:12.133
She had to leave home.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.428
Had to? The Head of the Court
recommended six months.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.139
He wouldn't speak,
so she decided to leave.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.267
What do you mean, "decided"?

09:20.434 --> 09:22.394
It doesn't matter,
Your Honor, she left.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.438
That's why the husband
decided not to come.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.149
Do you support
the husband's actions?

09:32.613 --> 09:34.197
We'll wait a few minutes.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.201
Your Honor, it's a trick.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.329
There'll be no hearing without him.
That's enough for today.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.540
Haim, bring in the next couple.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.670
TWO MONTHS LATER

09:57.763 --> 09:58.972
He won't come.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.517
Let's wait.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.106
We've been waiting
for an hour and a half.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.942
What can we do?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.907
Carmel, your shirt...

10:19.243 --> 10:20.327
Tuck it in.

10:21.746 --> 10:22.829
Okay?

10:30.463 --> 10:33.715
Adva and Shmulik Sade,
please come in.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.426
- Haim. If I may...
- No, not yet.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.219
Put on a skullcap, please.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.808
Your Honor,
we're waiting for the husband and...

10:59.867 --> 11:00.867
Let's go.

11:03.579 --> 11:04.996
Let's wait a little longer.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.093
What time is it?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.262
Almost 10:00.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.185
Normally, when a person is
summoned to court, he appears.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.020
THREE MONTHS LATER

11:29.188 --> 11:31.773
In respect of my client's rights,
impose sanctions on the husband!

11:32.775 --> 11:36.027
Since the law favors a husband's will
over a wife's wishes,

11:36.195 --> 11:37.570
at least he could show up!

11:37.738 --> 11:41.491
What are you angry about?
We summoned him.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.284
What else can we do?

11:43.452 --> 11:46.413
Everything in your power.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.623
Who is here on his behalf?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.377
Speak up!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.129
Hello, Viviane.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.214
I'm the husband's messenger.

11:56.632 --> 11:59.300
Why didn't he bother
to come himself?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.761
I don't know, Your Honor.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.304
What do you have to say?

12:05.558 --> 12:07.642
Your Honor,
the husband asked me

12:07.810 --> 12:10.562
to tell you that
he will not appear in court

12:11.063 --> 12:13.231
until his wife comes home.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.899
I'm not going back.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.277
I'll have you removed.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.946
In my court you speak
when spoken to.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.906
I'm not going back again.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.241
Look, good woman,

12:23.409 --> 12:25.785
return for the period
I recommend.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.663
Your Honor,
what is this disgrace?

12:28.831 --> 12:29.789
Calm down, you.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.169
You know we can't force
the husband at this stage.

12:34.336 --> 12:37.255
You're bending my client's will.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.884
Does it bother you
that she returns of her own free will?

12:41.051 --> 12:43.511
Her own free will?
Your Honor!

12:43.679 --> 12:46.598
Madam, help me and I'll help you.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.475
Return to your home,

12:48.642 --> 12:51.060
and if you cannot reach an accord,

12:51.228 --> 12:53.730
I give you my word,
before these witnesses,

12:53.898 --> 12:57.025
I will force him to appear in court,
like it or not.

12:57.651 --> 13:01.154
The husband wants reconciliation,
and so do we. She must go home.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.448
This hearing is adjourned.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.746
Carmel Ben Tovim, you listen...

13:09.914 --> 13:11.456
FIVE MONTHS LATER

13:11.624 --> 13:13.583
You keep shouting.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.460
Don't raise your voice...

13:16.086 --> 13:18.630
It's a religious court.
Don't show contempt!

13:18.798 --> 13:21.591
- I'm not.
- You're shouting and...

13:21.759 --> 13:24.344
You're in contempt
and you're shouting.

13:24.512 --> 13:28.473
You won't even give me
15 minutes.

13:29.099 --> 13:32.393
Gentlemen, we can't communicate
with screams and shouts.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.771
Pardon me, Your Honor.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.233
My client fulfilled
her husband's conditions

13:38.400 --> 13:39.901
and he doesn't do his part!

13:40.069 --> 13:42.070
But they live together now?

13:42.238 --> 13:45.198
- Yes, as requested.
- Then what's wrong?

13:45.366 --> 13:47.909
Everything is wrong,
that's why we're here.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.078
Why are you fanning the flames again?

13:50.246 --> 13:54.040
The husband's behavior is infuriating.
How long must my client wait?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.167
Look, I stand by my word,

13:56.335 --> 13:59.629
although I repeat:
I cannot force him to appear.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.006
Why not, Your Honor?

14:02.174 --> 14:05.718
His refusal to answer your summons
constitutes valid grounds.

14:06.428 --> 14:09.138
- What are you waiting for?
- You're out of order, Carmel.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.099
I will do so
because this poor woman

14:11.267 --> 14:14.269
fulfilled her obligations
to me and to her husband.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.772
If the husband doesn't appear
at the next hearing,

14:17.940 --> 14:18.940
in three months...

14:19.108 --> 14:21.568
Three months, Your Honor!
Three months?

14:21.735 --> 14:22.986
Carmel, shut up!

14:24.029 --> 14:25.321
You're annoying me!

14:25.948 --> 14:28.992
If the husband doesn't appear
at the next hearing,

14:29.159 --> 14:31.369
three months from today,

14:31.537 --> 14:34.330
I will take exception
with the law

14:34.498 --> 14:37.750
and suspend
his driver's license for a year.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.295
Really?

14:40.462 --> 14:42.463
He doesn't have one.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.173
He doesn't have one.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.343
No license?

14:47.845 --> 14:48.928
I see.

14:49.221 --> 14:52.140
- Was it revoked?
- No, he never had one.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.852
His credit cards will be blocked.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.022
He doesn't use credit cards.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.775
His bank account will be blocked.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.820
A joint account?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.906
Even if they're separated?

15:08.073 --> 15:10.867
My client deposits her salary
into their account.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.536
They're still paying off
their mortgage.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.872
How many years are left?

15:16.373 --> 15:17.498
11 years.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.376
You want us
to threaten him with jail?!

15:20.544 --> 15:21.753
Precisely, Your Honor.

15:21.921 --> 15:26.132
He wants reconciliation,
it's she who refuses, not him.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.054
Bring him here,
and we'll try to appeal to him.

15:31.221 --> 15:34.766
He won't appear,
the last four hearings are proof!

15:34.934 --> 15:36.100
What's going to change?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.060
Your Honor...

15:37.227 --> 15:38.394
Just a minute.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.104
Let me hear her now.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.194
Your Honors,

15:46.362 --> 15:49.405
I upheld my side of the bargain.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.408
Make him appear.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.953
You, as promised.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.376
Haim, bring the lady some water.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.461
I don't want water.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.676
You promised, Your Honor.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.779
Let's not mince words.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.824
I'll do all I can to make him appear.

16:54.763 --> 16:58.933
THREE MONTHS LATER - A YEAR
AND A HALF SINCE THE TRIAL BEGAN

17:00.728 --> 17:02.311
Welcome, sir.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.690
Thank you, Your Honor.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.942
We've waited for you a long time.

17:08.109 --> 17:12.363
Your refusal to appear
shows contempt for this court

17:12.531 --> 17:15.116
and wastes our precious time.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.077
Fulfill this court's orders

17:18.244 --> 17:20.246
or we will harden our hearts.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.664
Understood?

17:21.832 --> 17:23.207
Yes, Your Honor.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.084
Have you any regrets?

17:25.544 --> 17:26.836
Yes, Your Honor.

17:27.003 --> 17:29.088
What have you come to tell us?

17:29.590 --> 17:31.924
Your wife fulfilled your every wish,

17:32.092 --> 17:34.969
yet your marriage
is not working.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.388
Have you made up your mind?

17:37.556 --> 17:40.475
Will you grant this woman
a divorce?

17:58.452 --> 17:59.535
No, Your Honor.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.955
- You won't grant her a divorce?
- No.

18:03.123 --> 18:05.583
Then why are you here?
To say no?

18:05.751 --> 18:06.501
Yes.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.461
Do you realize

18:08.629 --> 18:11.798
that if you continue to refuse

18:11.965 --> 18:15.051
I can force you
to grant her a divorce?

18:15.552 --> 18:17.178
On what grounds, Your Honor?

18:18.138 --> 18:19.430
On what grounds?

18:19.598 --> 18:21.224
Yes, on what grounds?

18:21.391 --> 18:23.518
After driving your wife crazy,

18:23.685 --> 18:25.937
you want to drive us crazy too?

18:26.313 --> 18:27.522
Your Honor,

18:27.940 --> 18:31.192
we can't live together.
We aren't compatible.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.568
Be quiet!

18:32.736 --> 18:36.739
No court in the world can oblige
this woman to live with that man.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.243
Do you hear?
She doesn't want to live with you.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.829
It's my punishment.

18:42.996 --> 18:43.913
It's in His hands.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.084
If you see her as your punishment,

18:48.377 --> 18:50.837
grant her a divorce
and free yourself, too.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.005
No, Your Honor.

18:58.595 --> 18:59.929
I don't want to live with him.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.390
I don't want to.

19:04.935 --> 19:08.354
Listen, in 15 days you will
bring witnesses before me.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.357
If they don't provide me with cause,

19:11.525 --> 19:15.153
you will be sent home
to work it out!

19:15.529 --> 19:18.364
I need grounds!

19:25.205 --> 19:26.831
- I can't talk right now.
- Goodbye, Your Honors.

19:37.968 --> 19:42.138
TWO WEEKS LATER

19:44.266 --> 19:45.600
Hello, Carmel.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.768
Hello.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.189
It's been a long time.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.154
- Is Elisha here?
- Yes, he's in the restroom.

20:06.163 --> 20:09.123
If we keep this gracious,
it'll be all right.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.343
How's your mother?

20:20.719 --> 20:22.303
She's fine, thanks.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.431
Your father was...

20:28.018 --> 20:30.603
What a prodigy.

20:31.521 --> 20:33.064
He always knew...

20:33.941 --> 20:35.358
Knew what?

20:36.276 --> 20:39.570
He knew a lot--
A lot of things.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.447
Yes.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.325
He knew many things.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.411
Amsalem?

20:48.038 --> 20:49.247
The husband.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.582
Leave it to me, don't talk.

20:58.006 --> 21:01.008
Didn't we say
that you'd bring witnesses?

21:01.635 --> 21:03.094
Your Honor.

21:03.262 --> 21:07.598
We couldn't gather them,
people work, they're busy.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.977
I'm here on behalf
of my brother,

21:11.144 --> 21:13.229
and may my sister-in-law
pardon me,

21:13.397 --> 21:15.731
I have no intention to slander.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.985
Your qualities are well-known,
Rabbi Shimon. Speak.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.571
This is my brother,
ten years my junior.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.574
Back in Morocco, he was
a respected and admired man.

21:25.742 --> 21:29.120
Your Honor,
we are a family of scholars,

21:29.288 --> 21:30.579
people of the Book.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.499
And in my humble opinion,

21:33.667 --> 21:36.627
perhaps the couple's incompatibility

21:36.795 --> 21:40.256
stems from the inability
of my sister-in-law, Viviane,

21:40.424 --> 21:42.967
to run a kosher home
and observe Jewish law,

21:43.135 --> 21:45.011
as my brother would like.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.931
If she'd only follow the laws,
as my brother wishes,

21:49.099 --> 21:51.017
he would give her the world.

21:51.184 --> 21:52.768
And yet you demand

21:52.936 --> 21:56.063
that this man grants her a divorce?

21:56.398 --> 21:57.732
What for?
What for?

21:58.900 --> 22:02.403
Your brother didn't appear in court
when summoned

22:02.571 --> 22:05.156
and he forced us to be
heavy-handed with him.

22:05.324 --> 22:10.328
What do you ask this man to do?
To renounce his Torah?

22:10.495 --> 22:14.415
She doesn't allow him
to wear a skullcap outside.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.459
And that hurts my brother.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.919
He wishes to return to his roots.

22:19.087 --> 22:22.840
Which should he choose:
his religion and faith or his wife?

22:23.508 --> 22:25.926
He refuses to give up either,

22:26.470 --> 22:29.722
which is commendable.
It's a serious problem.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.682
That's my opinion.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.978
Do you think that herein lies
both the problem and the solution?

22:36.855 --> 22:39.065
The beginning of a solution,
Your Honor.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.778
I won't bad-mouth this woman,

22:43.945 --> 22:46.781
but my brother too,
suffered from his wife's wrath.

22:46.948 --> 22:48.991
And kept silent.

22:49.159 --> 22:49.992
Your Honor,
if I may...

22:50.160 --> 22:53.454
What does observance
have to do with incompatibility?

22:53.622 --> 22:54.997
Carmel, your late father...

22:55.165 --> 22:58.751
My father has nothing to do with this,
please leave him out of it.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.256
How can we not mention and praise

23:04.424 --> 23:07.176
Rabbi Sasson Ben Tovim,
venerable as he was,

23:07.344 --> 23:08.803
when his son stands before us?

23:08.970 --> 23:10.221
Not before you, Shimon.

23:10.389 --> 23:14.141
Your father was a guiding light
to many good men.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.811
Many good men.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.690
I'm not standing before you.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.610
We're standing before
these honorable Rabbis

23:24.778 --> 23:26.987
to find a solution for this couple.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.030
True.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.116
My client is a secular woman.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.617
And when they married?

23:31.785 --> 23:36.163
When they got engaged she was 15,
and came from a religious family, too.

23:36.331 --> 23:38.624
But she knew she was marrying
into a renowned rabbinic family.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.128
Her family is just
as respectable as his.

23:42.295 --> 23:43.629
Thank God.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.549
I'm certain that for another man

23:46.716 --> 23:49.427
my client would even wear a wig.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.971
If she left religion,
it's because of him.

23:52.139 --> 23:52.847
Because of him!

23:53.014 --> 23:56.642
He and his deeds
ruined religion for her.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.602
Carmel, be brief.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.230
We have no need for theories,
just facts.

24:01.398 --> 24:02.398
It's a fact.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.734
What did he do, God forbid,
to make her hate her faith?

24:06.278 --> 24:09.363
Why doesn't the husband
have a driver's license?

24:09.531 --> 24:13.033
- Driving can desecrate the Sabbath.
- Not on a weekday.

24:13.201 --> 24:15.369
My brother is afraid
that if he had one

24:15.537 --> 24:18.414
his wife would make him
desecrate the Sabbath.

24:18.582 --> 24:22.543
Many God-fearing Jews
have driver's licenses.

24:25.213 --> 24:27.923
My brother never had great eyesight,

24:28.091 --> 24:30.468
which is another reason
to avoid driving.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.804
We are men of Torah, why "excuses"?

24:33.972 --> 24:36.724
- Excuses...
- Why excuses?

24:36.892 --> 24:39.393
Excuses are a dime a dozen,
Shimon, my friend.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.896
What does this court prefer,
observance or domestic harmony?

24:47.360 --> 24:49.445
Without witnesses,
we won't continue.

24:49.613 --> 24:53.115
Why? Even with 10 witnesses,
no grounds will be found.

24:53.283 --> 24:57.161
This hearing is now adjourned.
A notice will be mailed to you, go.

24:59.122 --> 25:01.790
You're wasting the court's time.

25:23.563 --> 25:24.730
Excuse me.

25:24.898 --> 25:26.106
After you.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.620
We don't want witnesses either.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.497
TWO MONTHS LATER

25:41.831 --> 25:43.541
They're both stubborn.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.627
I can't force him
to grant her a divorce.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.421
And I can't force her to return,

25:49.589 --> 25:50.422
I'm sorry to say.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.508
Therefore,
I summoned witnesses.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.970
This isn't a murder trial,

25:56.137 --> 25:58.264
this woman wants a divorce.

25:58.431 --> 26:00.933
Who's to say what happens
behind closed doors,

26:01.101 --> 26:03.435
you're trying to read
their thoughts.

26:04.062 --> 26:08.190
Don't doubt our abilities,
granted by both Heaven and Earth.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.944
This woman's truth is hers alone.

26:12.487 --> 26:14.989
My client made up her mind
30 years ago.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.408
So why didn't she ask
for a divorce 30 years ago?

26:17.576 --> 26:20.828
She was very young
and she lacked the means,

26:20.996 --> 26:22.663
both physical and emotional.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.541
The court should not
dishonor this woman.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.085
Let Rabbi Solomon decide what to do.

26:28.253 --> 26:31.213
We've waited for his ruling
for years now

26:31.381 --> 26:33.424
but he's taking his time.

26:34.259 --> 26:38.095
- Is His Honor afraid to rule?
- One more insult and we're done.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.307
Rabbi Solomon has
the ability to rule

26:41.474 --> 26:43.434
on the most complex cases.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.271
I have a question.
Are you married?

26:48.315 --> 26:49.940
Do you have a family?

26:52.861 --> 26:53.861
No, Your Honor.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.738
The truth comes out.

26:55.905 --> 26:58.198
Why not?
Do you have a defect?

27:00.994 --> 27:03.203
I'm not on trial, Your Honor.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.873
Everyone is on trial.

27:06.916 --> 27:09.710
Every man's life is on trial.

27:10.211 --> 27:14.340
Yours is worth the same
as that of your client, the defendant,

27:14.507 --> 27:18.344
and every witness who appears here.

27:18.678 --> 27:19.720
True.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.097
We are all witnesses,

27:22.849 --> 27:23.974
all of us, Your Honor.

27:24.768 --> 27:29.355
Without witnesses, we won't continue.
Haim, please bring the witness in.

27:33.151 --> 27:33.817
So?

27:33.985 --> 27:35.277
Let's go.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.907
Your name?

27:40.075 --> 27:42.660
Emil Amzaleg,
son of Shmuel and Rachel,

27:42.827 --> 27:46.288
Viviane Amsalem's eldest brother.

27:46.456 --> 27:48.916
Do you know the Amsalem couple well?

27:49.084 --> 27:51.293
Of course, Your Honor.
She's my sister.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.420
I know her well.

27:53.588 --> 27:56.590
She's a good wife
and a wonderful mother.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.384
The truth is, Your Honor,

27:58.551 --> 28:00.511
as far as I know,
she's done

28:01.012 --> 28:03.681
everything she could
to stay with this man...

28:04.474 --> 28:08.018
Elisha, whom we love and respect.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.020
He's a wise man...

28:10.689 --> 28:11.814
A good man.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.024
But the truth is, Your Honor...

28:14.567 --> 28:16.735
they just don't get along.

28:16.903 --> 28:19.613
We tried to talk to them,

28:19.781 --> 28:22.074
to settle matters between them,

28:22.534 --> 28:23.659
but...

28:24.119 --> 28:26.203
it never worked.

28:27.580 --> 28:30.207
All in all,
we like him a lot.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.291
When they married,

28:32.377 --> 28:33.210
we were glad.

28:38.466 --> 28:40.592
What's that look?
Isn't it true?

28:42.387 --> 28:44.304
Don't interrupt the witness.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.268
Believe me, Your Honor,

28:49.436 --> 28:51.520
we always said,
"What do you want?

28:51.688 --> 28:55.858
Elisha is a good man. Where will
you find another husband like him?

28:56.526 --> 28:59.445
He gives you his salary,
he helps around the house,

28:59.612 --> 29:01.071
he doesn't throw away money,

29:01.239 --> 29:04.366
he doesn't fool around,
he doesn't gamble,

29:04.534 --> 29:06.910
not on cards nor on the lottery,

29:07.579 --> 29:09.329
he doesn't beat you,

29:09.497 --> 29:11.331
Sister, it's in your hands."

29:12.417 --> 29:15.085
He always agreed
with her decisions.

29:15.795 --> 29:19.423
He comes to our home,
and honors us on holidays,

29:19.758 --> 29:22.885
and treats us to his beautiful voice.

29:23.052 --> 29:27.598
When he sings in synagogue
even the birds stop to listen!

29:27.932 --> 29:31.769
That's it, everyone will tell you,
he's the perfect man.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.771
What are you trying to say?

29:33.938 --> 29:35.105
I think, Your Honor,

29:35.440 --> 29:38.859
that my sister,
as much as I love her,

29:39.652 --> 29:42.362
is hard-headed, stubborn.

29:42.530 --> 29:46.366
We've tried to talk to her,
to no end.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.453
I told him time and time again,

29:49.829 --> 29:53.373
"Elisha, you have a problem.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.542
A woman needs a strong hand.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.587
A woman needs boundaries."

29:58.755 --> 30:00.464
But he...

30:01.216 --> 30:02.382
It's not his way.

30:02.550 --> 30:06.512
I, personally, have always wished
she'd go back to him.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.555
Didn't I tell you?

30:10.350 --> 30:13.977
Your sister's husband, Elisha,
an honest man, right?

30:14.145 --> 30:16.438
My client also says
he's a good man,

30:16.606 --> 30:19.858
but he isn't a good husband for her.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.194
Carmel, watch your mouth!

30:22.362 --> 30:25.030
He's a good man
and a good husband.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.450
How should I know
if they're compatible?

30:28.618 --> 30:30.035
What does it matter?

30:30.203 --> 30:33.288
Is my wife right for me?
No.

30:33.456 --> 30:37.251
I make her right for me,
and that's that. No nonsense.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.546
- Your Honor, may I?
- Go ahead.

30:40.713 --> 30:41.547
Emil Amzaleg,

30:42.173 --> 30:44.675
is your sister a good wife?

30:44.843 --> 30:47.302
A good wife, a woman of valor.

30:47.470 --> 30:48.846
And is he a good man?

30:50.807 --> 30:52.182
You heard what I said.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.102
Head and shoulders
above the crowd.

30:55.728 --> 30:59.022
In your opinion, having seen
them together for over 20 years,

30:59.774 --> 31:02.943
do you think they've had
a good life together?

31:13.913 --> 31:15.956
We're waiting.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.082
Speak.

31:22.171 --> 31:23.213
No, Your Honor.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.757
And in your opinion,

31:25.925 --> 31:29.136
has your sister suffered in
her marriage to this man?

31:33.391 --> 31:34.266
Answer.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.351
She's suffered a lot.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.187
Good, describe their married life

31:39.355 --> 31:41.523
in a word or two.

31:48.948 --> 31:50.532
We're waiting.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.493
I'm thinking, Your Honor.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.580
That's a tough question.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.165
Answer, Emil.

32:01.461 --> 32:02.711
Bitter as heck.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.087
That's all.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.506
Does the defense
have any questions?

32:06.674 --> 32:08.050
Yes, Your Honor.

32:08.217 --> 32:10.761
Just a few questions, if I may.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.095
Go ahead.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.891
Honorable Emil,
family man that you are,

32:16.309 --> 32:19.561
is my brother good to your sister?

32:20.355 --> 32:22.105
Of course, Rabbi Shimon.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.733
And has he given her

32:25.151 --> 32:26.818
everything he could?

32:27.153 --> 32:28.445
Above and beyond.

32:29.405 --> 32:32.699
And did they build
an exemplary Jewish home?

32:32.867 --> 32:34.368
Yes, Rabbi Shimon.

32:34.535 --> 32:37.746
And did they raise children
to the glory of Israel?

32:38.998 --> 32:40.207
And how!

32:40.833 --> 32:43.794
If you answered positively
to these questions,

32:43.962 --> 32:45.879
why should we separate them?

32:47.131 --> 32:51.301
I never said we should separate them,
God forbid...

32:51.469 --> 32:52.511
Thank you, sir.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.600
You may go, Emil Amzaleg.

32:58.768 --> 32:59.851
Ignorants!

33:02.313 --> 33:04.064
Haim, see the witness out.

33:05.191 --> 33:08.568
Thank you.
Just perfect.

33:08.736 --> 33:09.903
Thank you, Emil.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.701
The witness, Ms. Evelyn, please.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.418
Madam.

33:26.379 --> 33:29.756
I just wanted to say hello.
What's the big deal?

33:29.924 --> 33:31.925
She hasn't yet been permitted to speak.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.011
State your full name.

33:34.554 --> 33:35.512
Sure.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.975
Evelyn Ben Chouchan, daughter of
Massouda and Jacob Ben Chouchan.

33:40.143 --> 33:41.727
For the defense?

33:41.894 --> 33:42.978
The defense?

33:43.563 --> 33:46.314
I'm the sister-in-law of Emil,
who's just spoken.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.775
- On our behalf.
- Let's begin.

33:48.943 --> 33:50.360
Your relation to the plaintiff?

33:51.070 --> 33:53.572
I live with my sister Rachel
and her husband.

33:54.073 --> 33:54.740
For how long?

33:56.075 --> 33:57.492
Eight years, Your Honors.

33:57.952 --> 34:00.037
The plaintiff lives with you?

34:00.413 --> 34:02.039
Yes, in the yard.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.834
- Are you in close contact?
- What do you mean? Of course!

34:06.002 --> 34:08.920
As soon as she gets home,
I'm at her place.

34:09.088 --> 34:12.882
I also take the food she cooks
to her son and to...

34:13.051 --> 34:14.259
her husband.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.594
Every day? To her husband?

34:17.054 --> 34:20.348
Yes, sure. It's not far.
A ten-minute walk.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.143
Not on the Sabbath.

34:23.936 --> 34:26.688
Has the plaintiff lived honorably

34:26.856 --> 34:29.649
since you've lived together?

34:29.817 --> 34:30.984
Can I?

34:31.152 --> 34:33.445
Of course!
I know every step she takes.

34:33.612 --> 34:36.281
When she goes to work,
comes home, where she's been...

34:36.449 --> 34:38.366
I also clean her beauty parlor,

34:38.534 --> 34:41.620
almost every day,
for extra income.

34:42.621 --> 34:44.164
We're very close.

34:44.331 --> 34:45.665
Do you know

34:45.833 --> 34:49.418
if the plaintiff
has seen other men?

34:50.004 --> 34:51.505
She hasn't.

34:51.672 --> 34:55.467
Every day, it's:
home, work, home, work.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.385
You're always home
to see that?

34:58.054 --> 34:59.930
- Where else would I be?
- And you?

35:00.431 --> 35:02.557
Do you go on dates?

35:02.934 --> 35:05.185
Singles' events?

35:06.312 --> 35:08.563
Maybe once or twice.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.941
And the plaintiff never came with you?

35:11.484 --> 35:14.694
No, that's for singles,
Viviane's married.

35:14.862 --> 35:18.740
Do you know of any suitors
she's had during this time?

35:25.081 --> 35:28.750
- No.
- Why did you hesitate?

35:28.918 --> 35:30.168
Your Honor makes me nervous.

35:30.336 --> 35:33.463
Your Honor, my client
has never cheated on her husband.

35:33.631 --> 35:36.758
Cheated? God forbid.
Did I say cheated?

35:36.926 --> 35:39.803
Of course not!
But now that she's available...

35:39.971 --> 35:41.429
No, not available,

35:41.597 --> 35:46.309
but since she doesn't live with him
people think she's available,

35:46.477 --> 35:49.729
so they look at her, how not?
And probably they want her...

35:50.148 --> 35:51.690
It's irrelevant.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.984
Of course, it's irrelevant!

35:54.152 --> 35:58.155
She hasn't even bought a new dress,
let alone cheated...

35:58.823 --> 36:00.657
We're chaste.

36:01.492 --> 36:02.659
That's how it is.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.120
Your Honors, we never claimed that.

36:05.288 --> 36:07.330
My client doesn't have a lover.

36:07.498 --> 36:10.500
Never! I don't have one,
how could she?

36:10.668 --> 36:13.587
Men have always admired my client.

36:13.754 --> 36:17.048
We can summon every man
who ever looked at a married woman.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.216
Ridiculous.

36:19.635 --> 36:21.845
- Your Honor, may I?
- Go ahead, Carmel.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.054
Thank you.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.599
Ms. Ben Chouchan.

36:25.766 --> 36:26.850
Yes, Carmel?

36:28.895 --> 36:30.729
How would you describe Viviane?

36:32.148 --> 36:34.649
She's... an amazing woman.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.401
I'm crazy about her.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.236
And Elisha?

36:41.032 --> 36:42.073
Special.

36:43.701 --> 36:44.743
A special man.

36:47.663 --> 36:50.040
What would you wish for her?

36:50.208 --> 36:53.001
A good life,
and to end this story.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.753
You can't force it.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.714
How long must one wait, Carmel?
How long?

36:58.090 --> 36:59.007
Right.

36:59.550 --> 37:05.263
And while waiting in limbo,
do you think she's happy?

37:05.431 --> 37:07.432
A chained-up dog
has a better life.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.976
She doesn't enjoy a minute.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.895
Thank you, Evelyn.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.022
There you have it, torture.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.982
That's all, Your Honor.

37:16.150 --> 37:19.945
Your Honors, just a few questions.

37:20.112 --> 37:20.779
May I?

37:21.572 --> 37:23.573
Go ahead. Come forward.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.033
Thank you.

37:26.869 --> 37:30.372
Have you ever lived on your own?

37:31.123 --> 37:31.998
No, sir.

37:32.166 --> 37:35.085
With my mother,
and when she died, with my sister.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.046
- Never alone.
- So never with a man?

37:38.214 --> 37:39.965
What does it matter, Your Honor?

37:40.132 --> 37:42.133
Pardon me. I'll rephrase.

37:42.301 --> 37:45.428
You haven't built a Jewish home,
right?

37:46.430 --> 37:48.848
No, as I said.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.393
I've been single all my life.

37:51.769 --> 37:55.438
- Do you envy Viviane?
- Huh?

37:55.940 --> 37:58.066
Me, envy Viviane?

37:58.567 --> 38:01.444
What is this crap?
Is he crazy?

38:01.612 --> 38:04.364
What's my colleague getting at?

38:04.532 --> 38:08.702
If she envies her, she might wish
for other women to share her fate.

38:08.869 --> 38:11.496
In her position, barren!

38:11.664 --> 38:13.290
What's he talking about?

38:14.041 --> 38:16.084
Don't let him get away with this!

38:16.252 --> 38:17.961
Thank you. You can go now.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.171
What do you want to know?

38:20.339 --> 38:22.048
Make him retract his words!

38:22.216 --> 38:24.467
Thank you.
Your testimony is over.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.512
He ought to retract his statement.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.848
I asked a question.

38:30.016 --> 38:32.559
I didn't ask you anything, Carmel.

38:33.394 --> 38:34.561
Sit down!

38:35.021 --> 38:37.939
I'm Rachel Amzaleg
and I'm married, thank God.

38:38.107 --> 38:42.360
So no one can humiliate me
with questions of that kind.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.362
What's there to say?

38:44.530 --> 38:47.157
This woman doesn't want
to live with him.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.243
And I wouldn't live with him
for one day.

38:50.536 --> 38:51.703
There, you see?

38:51.871 --> 38:54.831
The witness is out of order.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.333
No one asked for your opinion.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.377
Why is he talking
to my sister like that?

38:59.712 --> 39:02.630
Don't you dare shout
in my courtroom.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.300
How long have you known
the couple?

39:05.468 --> 39:07.177
For ages, sir.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.345
Your Honor!

39:08.512 --> 39:09.637
Your Honor.

39:10.431 --> 39:14.309
I met my husband, Emil,
before Elisha proposed to her.

39:14.477 --> 39:19.022
- But they got married first...
- We're talking about the couple.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.691
They aren't compatible.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.028
Oil and water, they don't mix.
That's all.

39:25.613 --> 39:28.156
Why force them to stay together?

39:28.324 --> 39:31.076
- Any questions, Rabbi Shimon?
- Yes, Your Honor.

39:33.037 --> 39:37.415
Isn't it hard to share your house
with both your sister and sister-in-law?

39:38.626 --> 39:42.754
Not at all!
They can stay with me forever.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.589
You think marriage is a picnic?

39:44.757 --> 39:47.217
They give me both
physical and emotional support.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.553
Your Honor, between us,

39:50.721 --> 39:53.515
it's not that I'm not dying
to marry off my sister Evelyn.

39:53.682 --> 39:55.725
I've been trying for years.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.143
Before we came here,

39:57.311 --> 39:59.312
I told her,
put on makeup,

39:59.480 --> 40:01.940
do your hair,
dress up nice.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.817
At 50, all you can get
is a divorced man.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.193
And they're all here!

40:05.361 --> 40:07.404
Can I continue interrogating?

40:07.571 --> 40:08.863
Go ahead, Rabbi Shimon.

40:09.782 --> 40:10.907
"Interrogation"!

40:13.077 --> 40:15.703
Do you speak to the plaintiff?

40:17.623 --> 40:19.290
She lives with me!

40:19.458 --> 40:22.419
And in your conversations,
have you ever tried

40:22.586 --> 40:24.712
to convince her to go back home?

40:24.880 --> 40:28.049
Your Honor,
I've told her time and again

40:28.217 --> 40:32.095
that it's best to make up
and move back.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.597
A divorced women in Israel eats shit!

40:35.266 --> 40:37.767
Watch your mouth.

40:37.935 --> 40:38.893
Excuse me,

40:39.061 --> 40:41.646
Your Honor, but you tell me

40:41.814 --> 40:43.982
who wants to marry
a divorced woman?

40:44.150 --> 40:48.403
I'm telling you,
the Russian immigration did us in!

40:49.363 --> 40:50.613
Did us in!

40:50.781 --> 40:54.451
If you're divorced,
all your girlfriends stay away.

40:54.618 --> 40:56.661
They're afraid
you'll steal their husbands.

40:57.079 --> 40:59.289
But I understand her, Your Honor.

40:59.707 --> 41:04.002
That man is intolerable!
No woman would stay with him.

41:04.170 --> 41:07.088
Your Honors,
I think the lady has gone too far.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.132
She wasn't asked about Elisha.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.010
30 years of marriage is too much.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.636
If you ask me,

41:13.804 --> 41:15.847
this poor woman paid her debt

41:16.015 --> 41:17.265
long ago.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.101
So enough!
Set her free.

41:20.269 --> 41:22.020
That's enough, get out.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.564
I'm not leaving until I finish.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.107
Get out.

41:26.484 --> 41:30.361
I don't want to hear
any more from you, all right?

41:31.530 --> 41:33.281
Emil! What is...

41:33.449 --> 41:34.782
Her purse.

41:38.913 --> 41:40.997
Madam, your purse!

41:52.009 --> 41:53.676
Mrs. Amsalem.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.390
TWO MONTHS LATER

42:01.310 --> 42:02.477
Your name?

42:05.773 --> 42:07.899
Simon Abecassis.

42:09.068 --> 42:09.859
Profession?

42:10.027 --> 42:10.944
Merchant.

42:11.487 --> 42:14.239
- What do you deal in?
- Spices.

42:14.949 --> 42:16.074
Sir,

42:16.242 --> 42:18.451
you are the Amsalem's neighbor.

42:19.161 --> 42:20.161
True.

42:20.454 --> 42:21.579
For a long time?

42:22.289 --> 42:22.914
True.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.918
What can you tell us about them?

42:27.086 --> 42:30.046
What's to tell?
They're like any couple.

42:30.756 --> 42:33.174
I go to synagogue with Elisha.

42:33.634 --> 42:35.510
Viviane and Dona are friends.

42:36.345 --> 42:38.763
We've been next-door neighbors
for 20 years.

42:38.931 --> 42:43.017
His kids come over, we go there.
Like brothers.

42:43.185 --> 42:45.728
I couldn't ask for better neighbors.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.065
What kind of husband is he?

42:49.441 --> 42:51.192
An exemplary husband.

42:52.736 --> 42:55.196
- How does he treat his wife?
- Exemplarily.

43:06.166 --> 43:10.211
I haven't a bad word to say about him.

43:10.796 --> 43:12.964
He's a man and husband

43:13.132 --> 43:14.591
of example.

43:18.721 --> 43:21.389
Simon, dear,
since you are neighbors,

43:21.557 --> 43:25.018
can you tell us
if you've ever heard them fight?

43:25.686 --> 43:26.394
Fight?

43:28.439 --> 43:30.773
Like me and my wife Dona do.

43:34.862 --> 43:36.070
Thank you, that's all.

43:36.238 --> 43:38.072
The witness is dismissed.

43:38.616 --> 43:39.866
If you please.

43:40.284 --> 43:41.993
Come in, madam.

43:42.369 --> 43:44.162
The witness may go.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.706
Stand at the podium.

43:48.083 --> 43:49.334
The witness may go.

43:49.501 --> 43:50.960
- I'm staying.
- No, go.

43:51.128 --> 43:52.629
I do nothing without him.

43:52.796 --> 43:53.463
Your Honor?

43:55.716 --> 43:58.134
Please step back a little,

43:58.927 --> 44:00.553
toward the wall.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.765
Please move, Abcassis. Back.

44:04.767 --> 44:07.018
- Abecassis.
- Excuse me, Abecassis.

44:07.186 --> 44:09.354
Further back, to the pillar.

44:10.522 --> 44:12.732
Behind the pillar, please.

44:13.317 --> 44:14.901
A little more...

44:15.402 --> 44:16.569
Perfect, thank you.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.404
Name and profession?

44:18.572 --> 44:20.782
Dona Abecassis, homemaker.

44:21.116 --> 44:23.451
And I work in our spice shop.

44:23.619 --> 44:25.161
Go ahead, Rabbi Shimon.

44:29.458 --> 44:31.000
You were summoned

44:31.168 --> 44:35.088
because you may be
the couple's closest friends.

44:35.255 --> 44:36.005
True.

44:36.548 --> 44:40.426
We're next-door neighbors
and our doors are always open.

44:40.844 --> 44:44.681
When she needs a cup of oil or sugar,
I give her a kilo.

44:45.307 --> 44:46.432
Friends.

44:47.142 --> 44:49.560
Mr. Abecassis, please keep quiet.

44:49.728 --> 44:52.021
Mr. Abecassis, please.

44:52.398 --> 44:53.314
Thank you.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.902
Your husband said
that you've never heard

44:58.070 --> 45:00.238
the Amsalems fight or argue.

45:00.781 --> 45:01.489
True.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.282
Mr. Abecassis!

45:03.450 --> 45:05.034
Did you ever hear fights?

45:05.202 --> 45:07.954
Nothing special.

45:09.248 --> 45:12.583
Do you think Elisha
is a good husband to Viviane?

45:13.127 --> 45:14.961
- Sure he is.
- Mr. Abecassis!

45:15.462 --> 45:18.256
He's a good, respectable man.

45:18.424 --> 45:20.717
Every woman should be so lucky!

45:21.468 --> 45:23.803
My Simon, God bless him,

45:23.971 --> 45:26.889
won't even put
his dirty glass in the sink.

45:30.227 --> 45:32.854
She'll never find another like him.

45:33.814 --> 45:36.149
He lets her go out with the children,

45:36.316 --> 45:38.151
or with friends.

45:38.444 --> 45:39.986
Whoever heard of that?

45:41.363 --> 45:44.323
Would my Simon let me go out alone?

45:46.201 --> 45:48.786
Mrs. Abecassis,
as you know the couple,

45:48.954 --> 45:53.875
can you give this court grounds
to force Elisha to divorce her?

45:54.418 --> 45:56.627
God forbid.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.297
Divorce her? For what?

45:59.798 --> 46:01.507
That would be a shame.

46:01.675 --> 46:02.508
Thank you, Dona.

46:02.968 --> 46:04.135
No more questions.

46:08.056 --> 46:09.724
20 years together?

46:11.143 --> 46:13.936
Yes, we met at a model housing expo.

46:14.104 --> 46:16.773
Who do you think
is a better husband,

46:16.940 --> 46:19.233
your husband
or Viviane's husband?

46:20.611 --> 46:22.487
That's immaterial, Your Honor.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.156
What a stupid question!

46:25.324 --> 46:28.701
I'm trying to determine
the witness's point of departure.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.036
What departure?

46:30.204 --> 46:30.912
Go ahead.

46:31.079 --> 46:33.539
Are you happy with your marriage?

46:33.957 --> 46:35.625
Sure, I'm happy.

46:36.668 --> 46:37.794
In your opinion,

46:37.961 --> 46:41.130
what makes your marriage
a happy marriage?

46:41.298 --> 46:44.175
Look, sir, we each have our roles.

46:44.635 --> 46:48.054
Simon supports us,
I work in the shop,

46:48.222 --> 46:51.974
do the housework, raise the kids,
clean, cook, like normal.

46:52.684 --> 46:56.437
And as God is my witness,
he never raised a hand to me.

46:57.272 --> 46:58.731
Never raised a hand to her.

46:59.441 --> 47:02.109
Did you ever refuse Simon a request?

47:02.486 --> 47:05.738
What do you mean?
I do what I have to do.

47:08.492 --> 47:09.826
Mrs. Abecassis,

47:10.577 --> 47:12.411
do you have
your own bank account?

47:18.919 --> 47:19.585
No.

47:21.004 --> 47:22.922
Did you ever want
your own bank account?

47:23.924 --> 47:26.467
What does she need
a bank account for?

47:26.635 --> 47:28.094
She has everything she needs.

47:28.971 --> 47:29.971
Good.

47:30.305 --> 47:31.639
Mrs. Abecassis,

47:32.140 --> 47:34.267
how many children did you want?

47:35.185 --> 47:37.103
Four, like normal.

47:37.563 --> 47:39.188
And you have three daughters.

47:39.690 --> 47:43.025
They're perfect,
may God protect them.

47:43.652 --> 47:46.779
Can you tell us
why you had six miscarriages

47:46.947 --> 47:49.031
after you had your three daughters?

47:49.199 --> 47:51.409
Your Honor, what is he driving at?

47:51.577 --> 47:53.035
Shimon, be quiet, please.

47:53.579 --> 47:55.246
Answer, Mrs. Abecassis.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.666
We wanted more kids.

47:58.834 --> 48:00.418
You did or your husband did?

48:02.462 --> 48:04.463
What do you mean?
I was pregnant.

48:04.631 --> 48:06.883
You have three healthy daughters,

48:07.175 --> 48:09.844
and you keep getting pregnant

48:10.012 --> 48:13.431
despite the miscarriages
that put your life at risk.

48:20.105 --> 48:22.148
Are you afraid of your husband,

48:23.483 --> 48:24.734
Mrs. Abecassis?

48:27.029 --> 48:28.321
She isn't afraid.

48:29.698 --> 48:30.990
You're afraid?

48:32.117 --> 48:33.117
Tell him.

48:35.245 --> 48:36.078
Tell him!

48:40.459 --> 48:41.751
She's not afraid.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.336
I'm not afraid.

48:43.879 --> 48:46.464
- I give him the respect he deserves.
- Respect?

48:48.216 --> 48:49.550
You wanted sons.

48:50.052 --> 48:51.844
Your husband wanted a son.

48:53.639 --> 48:54.805
Dona, let's go.

48:58.226 --> 49:01.187
Mrs. Abecassis,
there's an Earthly court

49:01.355 --> 49:02.730
and a Heavenly court.

49:02.898 --> 49:04.273
He's intimidating her.

49:04.441 --> 49:08.027
I'm not intimidating her,
I'm stating a fact.

49:08.570 --> 49:10.738
It's her husband who intimidates her.

49:15.535 --> 49:20.081
Madam, are you afraid
to speak your mind?

49:24.586 --> 49:26.003
I'm not afraid.

49:26.296 --> 49:27.630
Then tell us why

49:27.798 --> 49:31.550
Elisha lets Viviane go out,
and go on vacation alone?

49:33.387 --> 49:34.720
Look, sir,

49:34.888 --> 49:37.723
Elisha doesn't like those things.

49:38.266 --> 49:41.435
And he doesn't want to say no,
so he lets her.

49:41.728 --> 49:42.478
Liberal.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.021
Liberal?

49:44.189 --> 49:46.607
He doesn't have to like it.

49:47.317 --> 49:49.318
I want you to come home.

49:49.486 --> 49:52.405
I'm begging you, come home.

49:52.572 --> 49:53.823
No, Simon.

49:57.869 --> 49:59.453
Let me speak.

50:00.372 --> 50:03.582
It's hard for a woman to be alone,

50:04.292 --> 50:07.503
when everyone else has a partner.

50:08.714 --> 50:09.755
Elisha,

50:09.923 --> 50:11.007
forgive me.

50:11.174 --> 50:12.550
I'm sorry.

50:13.051 --> 50:15.928
I told you:
what was she supposed to say?

50:16.096 --> 50:17.555
You went away,

50:18.140 --> 50:21.475
you were at work,
you have errands to do.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.769
She didn't want to lie.

50:24.271 --> 50:26.147
So she didn't go out a lot.

50:26.314 --> 50:31.652
But for the kids' sake,
so they'd feel like everyone else,

50:31.820 --> 50:35.990
she took them out.
Should she have stayed home?

50:37.034 --> 50:38.492
Normal...

50:39.745 --> 50:41.328
So what are you saying?

50:41.955 --> 50:45.166
Who is the perfect husband, Dona?

50:46.835 --> 50:48.252
Simon or Elisha?

50:48.712 --> 50:50.046
I'm leaving.

50:50.213 --> 50:51.464
Wait, Simon.

50:52.841 --> 50:55.676
He wants her to shame her husband
in public?

50:55.844 --> 50:57.053
Carmel, I'm warning you!

50:57.220 --> 50:59.055
Your Honor, I apologize.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.850
I don't need an answer.

51:03.018 --> 51:03.976
Excuse me.

51:06.354 --> 51:08.856
Mrs. Abecassis, think carefully.

51:09.024 --> 51:10.691
It's 8:00, your husband is asleep,

51:10.859 --> 51:14.820
and you, after working all day,
you are awake.

51:14.988 --> 51:15.780
Cooking.

51:15.947 --> 51:17.698
Cooking, into the night.

51:18.241 --> 51:20.618
Did you ever hear
the Amsalems fight?

51:20.786 --> 51:21.786
Once in a while.

51:21.953 --> 51:24.288
What do you do
when you hear them?

51:24.706 --> 51:27.374
I wait a little and then I go in.

51:27.542 --> 51:29.293
You wait and then go in.

51:29.461 --> 51:30.878
That's what I said.

51:31.838 --> 51:32.713
That's what you do.

51:32.881 --> 51:34.381
You want to drive me crazy?
Yes!

51:34.549 --> 51:36.509
That's what you're used to doing?

51:36.676 --> 51:38.928
Leave me alone! Yes!

51:39.596 --> 51:41.430
It's a habit, Your Honor.

51:41.598 --> 51:42.807
Fine.

51:42.974 --> 51:44.183
Why do you wait?

51:45.477 --> 51:48.979
I wait to see if it'll blow over.

51:49.147 --> 51:51.148
I wait to see if I have to go in.

51:51.316 --> 51:54.610
- Why would you have to go in?
- I don't have to, but it's better.

51:54.778 --> 51:57.363
Anyway,
one of the kids comes to get me.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.534
Dona, I'm warning you,
why do you have to go in?

52:03.495 --> 52:05.579
They shout,

52:05.747 --> 52:08.082
it's frightening.

52:08.917 --> 52:11.001
How often do you have to go in?

52:11.461 --> 52:14.505
As I said, once in a while,
when it's necessary.

52:14.673 --> 52:18.008
What's "once in a while"?
Once a year? Once a month?

52:18.176 --> 52:20.261
Once every week or two.

52:20.428 --> 52:22.263
What does he want from me,
Your Honor?

52:22.430 --> 52:26.183
Once every week or two
you go in and see Viviane crying,

52:26.351 --> 52:27.476
screaming,

52:27.644 --> 52:30.563
and Elisha doesn't
raise his voice, right?

52:30.730 --> 52:34.650
He doesn't raise his voice.
He's gracious.

52:35.318 --> 52:37.528
Why do you think she cries?

52:37.696 --> 52:41.240
I don't know.
Everyone has their needs.

52:41.908 --> 52:44.034
What do you see when you go in?

52:51.418 --> 52:52.960
Viviane's crying.

52:56.173 --> 52:58.382
Then she throws something.

52:58.550 --> 52:59.383
And he?

52:59.968 --> 53:02.845
He closes the windows.
That's normal.

53:03.388 --> 53:07.516
It's normal that she screams
and he runs to close the windows?

53:07.684 --> 53:10.436
Do you want everyone
to hear them screaming?

53:11.146 --> 53:13.105
What does he do
that makes her cry?

53:27.579 --> 53:29.121
Mrs. Abecassis,

53:29.873 --> 53:31.498
does she cry for no reason?

53:41.218 --> 53:42.843
I told her...

53:44.638 --> 53:46.764
A smart woman...

53:47.557 --> 53:52.269
should know when to keep
her mouth shut.

53:52.687 --> 53:54.480
What do they want?

53:54.648 --> 53:56.232
Respect, that's all.

53:59.152 --> 54:00.986
He's a liberal man,

54:02.030 --> 54:05.783
and then she can do
whatever she wants.

54:07.786 --> 54:10.496
Viviane, I told you.

54:11.581 --> 54:13.249
Nothing but respect.

54:17.462 --> 54:18.837
Respect, that's all.

54:20.966 --> 54:23.050
Then you can do
whatever you want.

54:44.364 --> 54:45.781
Mrs. Abecassis,

54:48.785 --> 54:49.952
Viviane...

54:50.870 --> 54:52.454
She speaks to you?

54:53.373 --> 54:54.373
Yes,

54:54.749 --> 54:56.792
mostly about the home.

54:57.711 --> 55:00.546
Do you know if the couple
has friends?

55:01.214 --> 55:02.715
Friends?

55:02.882 --> 55:03.966
Yes, friends.

55:05.218 --> 55:07.094
Answer the question, madam.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.139
I don't really know.

55:12.726 --> 55:14.143
No, Your Honor.

55:15.729 --> 55:17.438
We have no friends.

55:17.605 --> 55:21.191
We don't go anywhere with anyone
and no one ever comes over.

55:21.359 --> 55:22.443
That's a lie.

55:22.610 --> 55:24.945
Ask him if we have friends.

55:25.113 --> 55:27.364
- Mr. Amsalem, do you have friends?
- Yes, Your Honor.

55:27.907 --> 55:30.576
Ask him who, please.
Just one name.

55:31.411 --> 55:33.871
The only people who tolerate him

55:34.372 --> 55:35.622
are Victor and Yvette

55:35.790 --> 55:38.584
who refused to testify
out of respect for him.

55:39.377 --> 55:40.669
All lies.

55:41.296 --> 55:43.464
I want to hear only the couple.

55:44.049 --> 55:45.966
Everyone else, out.

55:46.134 --> 55:47.676
Thank you, Mrs. Abecassis.

55:48.595 --> 55:50.429
Rabbi Shimon, please go out.

55:52.807 --> 55:54.516
Thank you, Carmel.

55:56.436 --> 55:58.228
Close the door, please.

55:59.898 --> 56:00.731
Your Honor...

56:01.524 --> 56:03.192
I make concessions.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.319
I even let her go out on the Sabbath.

56:05.487 --> 56:09.114
The kids watch TV, turn on the lights,
don't come to synagogue.

56:09.282 --> 56:12.284
He makes many concessions
on the Sabbath.

56:12.952 --> 56:14.411
Is that true, Mrs. Amsalem?

56:14.579 --> 56:16.330
Yes.
What does it matter?

56:16.498 --> 56:18.123
All the witnesses say so.

56:18.291 --> 56:20.626
That's how she was raised,
Your Honor.

56:21.669 --> 56:22.628
You ingrate.

56:23.004 --> 56:24.296
You have no shame?

56:24.464 --> 56:25.631
He has no shame.

56:25.799 --> 56:28.550
I always prepare
a big Sabbath dinner,

56:28.718 --> 56:30.511
I make the kids stay home.

56:30.678 --> 56:32.721
I start preparing on Wednesday.

56:32.889 --> 56:35.432
And I'm making meatballs,
fish, salads.

56:35.600 --> 56:38.143
Do you cook?
Tell the truth, do you cook?

56:38.311 --> 56:39.561
Thankless.

56:39.896 --> 56:40.521
Ingrate.

56:40.688 --> 56:42.314
Here we go again.

56:43.441 --> 56:45.401
That's right, here we go again.

56:45.860 --> 56:49.446
He sneaks his words
in below his breath

56:49.906 --> 56:51.865
so no one can hear,
but I hear.

56:52.033 --> 56:53.283
He said nothing.

56:53.451 --> 56:55.119
Your Honor,
you can't talk to her.

56:55.537 --> 56:57.621
She attacks me
as I open my mouth.

56:57.789 --> 56:58.872
Don't start in.

57:00.208 --> 57:03.627
Don't you start in.
If you want to talk to me, come home.

57:03.795 --> 57:06.755
No, I'm never coming home again.
It's over.

57:06.923 --> 57:08.257
I did,

57:08.425 --> 57:10.551
as I was asked, so what?

57:10.718 --> 57:14.012
I slept with him in the same bed
and nothing happened.

57:14.472 --> 57:17.599
The whole time I was home
he didn't say a word to me.

57:17.767 --> 57:21.145
He was happy for his victory,
and still he kept sulking.

57:21.312 --> 57:22.354
That's a lie.

57:22.522 --> 57:24.273
I spoke to her a thousand times.

57:24.441 --> 57:25.899
- You spoke to me?
- Yes, I spoke to you.

57:26.734 --> 57:29.570
I was sick and he didn't even
bring me a cup of tea!

57:29.737 --> 57:32.531
- He slept in the living room!
- A tea for Elijah the Prophet!

57:32.699 --> 57:35.868
I don't want to talk to him,
that's my right.

57:36.035 --> 57:37.995
- Your Honor...
- Yes, let him write this down.

57:38.496 --> 57:42.207
Never a kind word to say...
But I'm not here to argue with him.

57:42.375 --> 57:44.418
I have enough of that at home.
Enough!

57:44.586 --> 57:47.087
No, Viviane.
What's over?

57:47.255 --> 57:48.172
What?

57:48.339 --> 57:49.798
Never, Viviane!

57:51.676 --> 57:52.801
Your Honor...

57:53.261 --> 57:56.430
if she doesn't apologize
for everything she's done

57:56.598 --> 57:58.182
I'll never give her a divorce.

57:58.349 --> 57:59.766
Your Honor, I'm warning him,

57:59.934 --> 58:03.312
I'm warning him
and you're all my witnesses,

58:03.813 --> 58:07.483
if he doesn't meet me halfway
I'll do what I please.

58:07.942 --> 58:09.151
I'm not scared.

58:09.319 --> 58:12.446
I've been kept
like a dog in a yard,

58:12.614 --> 58:14.656
but not for long.

58:14.824 --> 58:17.284
I'll rent an apartment
and start to live...

58:17.452 --> 58:18.577
Show respect.

58:18.745 --> 58:21.455
He'll come begging for a divorce.

58:21.623 --> 58:23.332
And he'll never find me.

58:23.500 --> 58:27.586
He'll regret this day, you'll see.

58:28.046 --> 58:31.798
I already regret all the years
I've lived with her,

58:31.966 --> 58:33.258
it's a failure.

58:34.052 --> 58:36.386
She shames herself, the children.

58:36.554 --> 58:38.889
What does she have to gain
from all this?

58:39.516 --> 58:40.933
It's you who will lose.

58:42.227 --> 58:44.144
We'll see who loses.

58:45.063 --> 58:46.355
We'll see.

58:46.648 --> 58:48.482
You want to keep me by force?

58:48.983 --> 58:50.108
Try.

58:53.613 --> 58:56.657
TWO WEEKS LATER

58:57.158 --> 59:01.245
You're here to testify
on behalf of your friend Elisha?

59:01.412 --> 59:02.204
Yes, Your Honor.

59:02.664 --> 59:05.374
What is your relationship
to both parties?

59:06.125 --> 59:09.920
The defendant has been a good friend
for many years.

59:10.880 --> 59:13.632
He brings great joy
to the congregation.

59:13.925 --> 59:16.051
And the plaintiff is...

59:16.761 --> 59:17.636
well-known.

59:17.804 --> 59:18.470
Well-known?

59:19.180 --> 59:23.809
I mean known for her beauty
and elegance.

59:24.102 --> 59:25.978
A professional hairdresser.

59:26.145 --> 59:27.604
Rabbi Shimon, if you please.

59:27.897 --> 59:29.439
Thank you, Your Honor.

59:30.733 --> 59:34.736
Mr. Jacob Ben Harouch,
you've known Elisha for many years.

59:36.614 --> 59:39.366
Do you know of any incident
that would attest

59:39.534 --> 59:41.451
to a flaw in his character?

59:42.537 --> 59:44.580
As I said, he's a saint.

59:46.082 --> 59:47.708
Never imposed himself
on anyone?

59:47.875 --> 59:49.918
No. Always gracious.

59:50.378 --> 59:51.044
Always.

59:51.588 --> 59:54.047
- Well-liked?
- Very.

59:54.215 --> 59:56.258
There's gossip in the synagogue, no?

59:56.676 --> 01:00:01.388
Thou shall not gossip,
or however the saying goes...

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:03.724
So you happen to hear:

01:00:03.891 --> 01:00:07.102
"This one went here,
that one went there..."

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:10.856
I know what everyone else knows,
no more, no less.

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:14.818
Everyone sees the sun, right?

01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:16.069
It's like that.

01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:18.280
And among all the rumors...

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.240
unwillingly, of course,

01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:24.411
did you ever hear anything

01:00:24.579 --> 01:00:28.373
about my brother Elisha Amsalem
or his home?

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:29.625
Nothing, never.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:33.086
And even if something happened,
we never heard about it.

01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:36.173
So if you don't hear,
it never happened.

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:39.176
- Everyone sees the moonlight.
- True.

01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:45.599
If you had a daughter,

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:48.685
would you let your daughter
marry him?

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:50.062
Without hesitation.

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:57.819
Sunlight, moonlight,
interesting.

01:00:59.113 --> 01:01:03.450
Jacob Ben Harouch, could it be
that the sunlight has blinded you?

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:04.618
What do you want, Carmel?

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:08.080
Didn't you hear
that Elisha Amsalem lives alone

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:12.668
and that his "well-known" wife
moved out four years ago?

01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:17.130
- For two and a half years, we didn't.
- How can that be?

01:01:17.298 --> 01:01:19.216
- Elisha didn't tell us.
- And then he did?

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:20.300
- No.
- Then what?

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:23.136
- People talked.
- What did they say?

01:01:23.304 --> 01:01:26.098
They said she left him because
they aren't compatible.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:27.974
That's what they said.

01:01:28.142 --> 01:01:29.184
What else?

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.311
They said he let her go

01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:33.730
and now he's waiting

01:01:34.273 --> 01:01:35.774
for her to calm down.

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:38.276
He never said no to her. Never.

01:01:38.444 --> 01:01:40.987
Domestic harmony
is all that matters to him.

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:43.490
You've been praying together
for a long time?

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:44.616
Yes.

01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:47.661
Did you ever have to mediate
between Elisha and anyone?

01:01:49.288 --> 01:01:50.539
Mediate?

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.667
What do you mean, mediate?

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.336
What it sounds like. Mediate.

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:58.964
Mediate? Yes.

01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:00.966
Go on.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.677
Look...

01:02:04.637 --> 01:02:06.805
Elisha, how should I put it?

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:09.182
He's pedantic.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:12.644
He likes things done his way.

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:18.024
When you say "pedantic,"
you mean "stubborn."

01:02:18.192 --> 01:02:20.110
Your Honor, he's interpreting!

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.946
Did you hear me say stubborn?

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:24.531
I said "pedantic."

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:27.117
Okay. Give us an example.

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:30.704
If a congregant doesn't
follow his advice,

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:32.539
or sings differently,

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.791
Elisha...

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.295
doesn't spare the rod.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.715
I suppose not all the congregants
sing like him

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:45.093
so you've had to mediate
between Elisha and...

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:47.220
two, three congregants.

01:02:47.388 --> 01:02:49.765
It's a synagogue,
that's how it goes.

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:52.559
Everyone has someone
he doesn't speak with.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:53.935
So does he.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:57.189
They don't speak.
What's the big deal?

01:02:57.356 --> 01:02:58.440
So what?

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.944
Can you give us a name?

01:03:04.405 --> 01:03:05.071
A name?

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:10.994
A name, please.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.040
Give us a name.

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:18.502
Abraham Zagouri.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.295
Zagouri.

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:24.549
They had a disagreement
and since then they aren't speaking?

01:03:24.717 --> 01:03:25.634
Yes.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.302
For how long?

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.346
It's not my business.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:32.182
Isn't it your job
as the Synagogue manager

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.267
to conciliate the congregants?

01:03:34.435 --> 01:03:35.685
Of course it is.

01:03:35.853 --> 01:03:37.604
Try to remember.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:40.065
- How long haven't they spoken?
- A while.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:41.066
How long?

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:41.942
A long time.

01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:43.527
- How long?
- Many years.

01:03:43.694 --> 01:03:45.946
- How many years?
- 15 years. Okay?

01:03:46.113 --> 01:03:46.905
Excellent.

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:50.116
For 15 years,
they haven't spoken

01:03:50.284 --> 01:03:52.577
because of a prayer
sung out of tune.

01:03:52.745 --> 01:03:55.163
Why nitpick?

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:59.125
Elisha talked, the other did too,
and no one has forgiven.

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:00.585
Is that a crime? No.

01:04:00.753 --> 01:04:02.170
It's not a crime.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:05.173
Did you try to mend the rift?

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.592
- How many times?
- Plenty of times.

01:04:08.427 --> 01:04:09.135
How many?

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.931
I don't know, on holidays...

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:15.517
Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah.

01:04:16.143 --> 01:04:19.145
Abraham Zagouri apologized
to Elisha Amsalem.

01:04:19.313 --> 01:04:20.313
Yes.

01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:21.898
How many times?

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.111
Several times.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:27.279
How many?

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:32.117
Until he gave up.

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:35.453
And he didn't forgive him. Did he?

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:43.712
He didn't.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.047
So what if my brother doesn't
speak to a congregant?

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:49.551
That's not the point, Shimon.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:53.263
The point is his endless patience.
He's made us wait five years!

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:55.640
And he could make us
wait even longer.

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:57.726
15 years, Your Honors.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:58.810
15 years!

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:00.312
No more questions.

01:05:00.479 --> 01:05:02.355
- So what?
- So nothing.

01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:03.815
The witness is dismissed.

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:08.111
The witness may leave.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:18.830
ONE WEEK LATER

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:21.499
Thanks for coming.
Your testimony means a lot

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:25.337
- because you know all the congregants.
- For 20 years.

01:05:25.504 --> 01:05:28.715
I heard what Mr. Ben Harouch said.
Nonsense.

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:33.261
Zagouri doesn't speak
to half the synagogue. Really.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:34.721
Good to know.

01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:39.059
Elisha is one of the best congregants
in our synagogue.

01:05:39.226 --> 01:05:42.354
He's humble. Special.
A true friend.

01:05:43.856 --> 01:05:45.440
That's all, Your Honor.

01:05:46.859 --> 01:05:48.860
Your Honor, if I may.

01:05:49.528 --> 01:05:50.904
So...

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:54.950
- Zagouri is the problem, not Elisha.
- Not Elisha!

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:58.954
Zagouri is ignorant,
he comes to synagogue twice a year,

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.330
and wants to teach us

01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:02.666
how to sing a verse!

01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:06.336
A guest doesn't tell his hostess
how to cook her stew.

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:08.254
The problem isn't him, it's her.

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:10.382
Her?

01:06:12.843 --> 01:06:13.885
No.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.554
What?

01:06:17.848 --> 01:06:18.807
Yes.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.102
I think...

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:25.271
If I may...

01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:27.482
this woman is deceitful.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:29.651
Excuse me?

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:31.528
Sit down, Mrs. Amsalem.

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.406
Why do you say she's deceitful?

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:38.994
Your Honor,
I work in the mall.

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:40.370
So what?

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:41.663
Just a minute!

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:46.626
Across from my store,
there's the Kapulsky Café.

01:06:46.794 --> 01:06:47.544
Yes.

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:50.171
And I saw this woman

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.298
with a strange man

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:54.175
at the Kapulsky Café.

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:56.177
He's lying, Your Honor!

01:06:56.345 --> 01:06:57.804
Silence, Mr. Amsalem.

01:06:58.472 --> 01:06:59.973
Maybe it was a relative?

01:07:00.474 --> 01:07:03.059
No, it's a big, respectable family.

01:07:03.227 --> 01:07:04.811
I know them all.

01:07:04.979 --> 01:07:06.604
He wasn't a relative.

01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:10.275
Maybe someone
from the extended family?

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.280
He didn't look like a relative.

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:19.784
- Did you see them holding hands?
- No.

01:07:19.952 --> 01:07:22.579
- Did they touch each other?
- No, Your Honor.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.914
It's all lies.

01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:28.877
Elisha, people talk.
I'm just trying to help you.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:30.336
Help me?

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:32.881
Elisha, hold on.

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.717
Shmuel, are you absolutely sure

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:38.595
that the woman you saw
was Viviane Amsalem?

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:50.023
I could never mistake her.

01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:51.858
Viviane Amsalem,

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:55.278
is this man, Shmuel Azoulay,
speaking the truth?

01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:57.447
Yes, Your Honor.

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:02.368
- Did you commit adultery?
- No.

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:05.330
Your Honor,
my client isn't an adulteress.

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:08.917
Idiot!

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:12.170
Watch yourself, Mrs. Amsalem,
I heard that.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:15.256
Know your place, woman.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:19.010
I know my place, Your Honor.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:23.180
In the Kapulsky Café is where
I met with my advocate,

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:24.349
Carmel Ben Tovim.

01:08:26.393 --> 01:08:27.685
- In the Café?
- Yes.

01:08:27.853 --> 01:08:29.145
Didn't you hear that?

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.983
Carmel Ben Tovim, do you confirm?

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:39.238
Yes, Your Honor.

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:43.868
Why were you sitting in a café
with this woman?

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:49.290
Your Honor,
my office is on Mt. Carmel,

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:53.211
and since I have a number
of clients in the suburbs

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:55.587
on Thursdays I meet them

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:57.756
at the Kapulsky Café,

01:08:58.175 --> 01:08:59.466
so as...

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:03.345
to make it easier for them.

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:05.515
We have short meetings.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:07.517
Dubious.

01:09:08.935 --> 01:09:10.103
Is something wrong?

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:13.314
A public place, total visibility.

01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:16.151
The café owners will confirm.

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:17.777
Shmuel Azoulay,

01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:20.822
do you recognize
Mr. Carmel Ben Tovim

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.908
as the man you saw sitting
with Mrs. Viviane Amsalem

01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:25.785
at the café in the mall?

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:35.712
I'm not sure, Your Honor.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.631
The man was wearing a skullcap.

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:42.343
The day I had an appointment
with Mrs. Amsalem,

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:45.013
I came from a funeral and forgot
to take the skullcap off my head.

01:09:46.055 --> 01:09:47.265
I forgot about it.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.100
You forgot.

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:52.353
Is there a problem?

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:59.360
The son of Sasson Ben Tovim,
the light unto the nations,

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.696
forgot to remove his skullcap?

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:03.990
Out of excitement...

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:05.283
I beg your pardon?

01:10:06.118 --> 01:10:07.327
You're pardoned.

01:10:07.494 --> 01:10:09.204
I don't need it, Shimon.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:14.083
A man who wrote half a ruling,
thinks of himself as a great Rabbi!

01:10:14.251 --> 01:10:17.045
This isn't the place
to insult Rabbi Shimon.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:21.007
Rabbi Shimon's rulings were
dismissed by Rabbi Abouhatsira.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.552
Shimon Amsalem
is a student, not a rabbi.

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:29.224
I never claimed to be one.

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:32.268
I never asked
to be called "Rabbi."

01:10:33.103 --> 01:10:35.021
I know my place

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:37.774
and trust in God
and Him alone.

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:40.777
And thank Him every day
for what He's given me.

01:10:47.534 --> 01:10:49.535
What are you doing, Mrs. Amsalem?

01:11:02.466 --> 01:11:04.759
What are you doing, Mrs. Amsalem?

01:11:05.844 --> 01:11:06.928
Pull your hair back!

01:13:00.584 --> 01:13:05.671
ONE MONTH LATER - THREE YEARS
SINCE THE TRIAL BEGAN

01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:08.216
Elisha,

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:12.970
did you let friends
come over or not?

01:13:13.138 --> 01:13:16.182
Very few came over.
Not often, I admit it.

01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:18.184
I didn't want it.

01:13:19.853 --> 01:13:21.437
Why not?

01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:23.147
Your Honor...

01:13:23.315 --> 01:13:27.068
I'm a man whose privacy
and modesty are important to him.

01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:30.321
Just like my parents,
may they rest in peace.

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:31.322
But she...

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:34.367
She tells her friends
and siblings everything.

01:13:34.535 --> 01:13:37.370
And they came over.
That's normal.

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:41.791
- Why did they come over?
- To reconcile between us.

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:43.418
It was intolerable.

01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:47.171
They came over so often
I started to detest them.

01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:50.174
Every time they came over
I had to defend myself.

01:13:50.342 --> 01:13:52.218
They were all on her side.

01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:53.928
How could we be friends?

01:13:55.889 --> 01:13:58.808
They never took my side.

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:03.521
I'm not like her,
I can't express my feelings.

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:05.106
Your Honor...

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.859
I was orphaned
of a father all my life.

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:12.488
- And the children?
- Always on her side.

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:15.658
They saw their mother fall apart

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:19.036
and their father standing there,
motionless, speechless.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.789
What were they to think?

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:24.417
Children always take
the mother's side, it's normal.

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:30.006
I didn't abandon my mother either.

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:32.592
I was with her to the day she died.

01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:36.929
No one took care of her.
None of my brothers helped me.

01:14:37.097 --> 01:14:37.763
Thank God,

01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:40.475
they each had
their own wives and children.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:41.642
And I...

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:43.352
was with my mother.

01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:52.570
You couldn't talk to each other?

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:54.572
You can't talk to her.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.532
All she does is scream.

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.289
I feel sorry for you, my brother.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:07.168
I'm sorry we didn't see you.

01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:14.550
Elisha,

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.929
does this woman respect you?

01:15:19.806 --> 01:15:21.057
No, my brother.

01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:25.311
Then why do you want her back?

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:28.314
She's my destiny and I'm hers.

01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:30.358
We will never part.

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:33.110
And that's that?

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:43.663
I love her.
I've always loved her.

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:58.344
That's all.

01:16:08.355 --> 01:16:10.273
Orphaned of a father.

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:13.985
It's sad.

01:16:15.028 --> 01:16:17.738
But now you're a husband and a father.

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:18.990
True.

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:24.412
You said she never compromises.

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:28.541
Your mother lived with you
for over 20 years!

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:31.127
I was always grateful for that.

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:32.878
How did you show it?

01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:41.387
And how, Elisha,

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.890
how can you mend the relationship?

01:16:50.522 --> 01:16:51.856
This woman...

01:16:53.233 --> 01:16:54.233
doesn't want you.

01:16:55.485 --> 01:16:56.902
She doesn't love you anymore.

01:16:57.821 --> 01:17:00.114
Isn't that reason enough
to let her go?

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:02.450
Can you really live with someone
who doesn't love you?

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:04.952
Not to say, is sick of you?

01:17:12.919 --> 01:17:15.379
One more question,
Elisha Amsalem.

01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:18.799
Have you tried
to meet your wife halfway?

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.926
To give her what she asks for?

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.345
Like what?

01:17:22.512 --> 01:17:25.640
When did you last
take her to a café?

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:29.185
A café?
It's not kosher.

01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:32.021
You could pack sandwiches

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:35.358
and take her to the beach.
You live by the sea, no?

01:17:35.734 --> 01:17:36.609
Right.

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:38.653
So?

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.990
I never thought of that, I admit.

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:48.454
Movies are kosher.
And I hear you love cinema.

01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:52.333
I love cinema,

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.752
I know all the stars

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.712
from Charles Bronson to...

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:01.467
Gregory Peck.

01:18:02.594 --> 01:18:05.012
But now there's a problem
with indecency.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.180
Indecency, Your Honor.

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:09.225
They show things I don't want to see.

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:13.312
It didn't use to be that way.

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:17.274
A flower... When did you last
come home with flowers and say:

01:18:17.442 --> 01:18:19.860
"Viviane, these are for you"?

01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:23.364
When did you last tell her:
"Viviane, I love you"?

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:27.660
Begging the court's pardon,
I must ask a question,

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:31.372
perhaps I'll finally find grounds
for divorce.

01:18:32.749 --> 01:18:35.334
When did you last have relations?

01:18:37.921 --> 01:18:39.004
When?

01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:52.518
She doesn't want to.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:56.897
I see.

01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:01.652
No more questions.

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:06.031
Thank you, Elisha Amsalem.

01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:10.995
Mrs. Viviane Amsalem,
please take the stand.

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:24.759
Your Honor, may I?

01:19:32.809 --> 01:19:34.143
Viviane Amsalem.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.938
Yes, Shimon?

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:39.440
Do you love my brother?

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:46.989
Have you tried to understand him
and his needs?

01:19:49.075 --> 01:19:49.992
Yes.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.412
Did you ever give
the relationship a chance?

01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:57.666
I tried every possible way.

01:19:57.834 --> 01:20:01.712
Why, then, did you insist
on putting my brother in situations

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.715
where you knew he couldn't deliver?

01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:07.468
Why did you embarrass him
time after time

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:10.387
in front of friends and family?

01:20:10.555 --> 01:20:14.141
He's ignored me and my needs
all my life.

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:16.560
He acts as if I was thin air.

01:20:16.728 --> 01:20:19.188
Have you turned
your children against him?

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:22.691
And told them what transpired
between you?

01:20:22.859 --> 01:20:24.610
He didn't spare them either.

01:20:24.778 --> 01:20:27.738
He'd bring them into the room
to talk behind closed doors.

01:20:28.198 --> 01:20:30.407
You shamed him
in front of the neighbors.

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:35.704
You screamed and swore at him.
You beat him in front of strangers.

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:37.581
Why?

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:40.042
That's not how it was.

01:20:40.585 --> 01:20:42.044
You didn't beat him?

01:20:42.587 --> 01:20:46.340
You didn't break dishes,
throw things at him?

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:48.384
I had outbursts.

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:50.261
Yes.

01:20:53.306 --> 01:20:55.766
It's easy to blame
the one who yells.

01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:58.561
The one who whispers venom
is innocent.

01:20:58.728 --> 01:21:01.146
He went to hell and back
with you

01:21:01.314 --> 01:21:04.108
and now you want to shame him?

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.652
To rub his failure in his face?

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.365
You always wanted
your marriage to fail

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:14.743
and your husband was loyal
and despite your actions

01:21:14.911 --> 01:21:17.580
he protected you and your children.

01:21:17.747 --> 01:21:20.082
Why must you harm him
again and again?

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:23.836
What did Elisha Amsalem ever do
but make you happy?

01:21:25.005 --> 01:21:28.257
If I were happy,
would I want to go?

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:32.720
Don't you think
I'd rather grow old peacefully?

01:21:33.263 --> 01:21:36.390
With my children?
Surrounded by my family?

01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:38.225
Did you know, Viviane,

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:41.353
that my brother could be rid of you
because you refuse to abide

01:21:41.521 --> 01:21:43.731
by the be fruitful and multiply
commandment?

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:47.026
Let him do it!
I gave him four children.

01:21:47.193 --> 01:21:49.653
And he was a good father
to your children.

01:21:50.196 --> 01:21:52.656
Yes.
And supported you.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:54.617
Yes.

01:21:54.784 --> 01:21:56.785
Yes, he supported you!

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.498
- And never raised a hand to you!
- No.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.585
Viviane Amsalem,

01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:08.339
you are a wayward woman.

01:22:08.673 --> 01:22:10.382
- Your Honor...
- Calm down, Shimon.

01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:13.719
You exploited him all your life.
He provided you with a home,

01:22:13.887 --> 01:22:17.389
family, children, security, honor

01:22:17.557 --> 01:22:19.183
and a good name!

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.644
And now you want
to throw all that away?

01:22:24.981 --> 01:22:25.856
Your Honor,

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:28.817
I don't want to live with this man.

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:30.527
It's my right.

01:22:31.529 --> 01:22:34.531
It's your right,
but it's not your choice.

01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:35.491
- Yes.
- No.

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:38.118
- Yes.
- No, it's not up to you.

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:41.914
If we were dealing with a man
who beats his wife,

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:44.875
who refused her pleasure,
clothes or food,

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:47.086
then we'd have
something to discuss,

01:22:47.253 --> 01:22:49.505
but before you stands a woman

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:51.382
whose wishes are irrational.

01:22:51.549 --> 01:22:55.386
A woman who beats her husband,
embarrasses him, refuses his needs,

01:22:55.553 --> 01:22:57.137
and he still wants her back!

01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:01.892
And you want to force this man
to grant her a divorce?

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:05.187
If that's how it is,
my duty in this court is over.

01:23:05.522 --> 01:23:08.691
What else can I say?
You're right, I'm crazy.

01:23:12.028 --> 01:23:13.654
No more questions.

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:30.671
It's a shame that Shimon chose
to ramble on

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:32.506
instead of listening.

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.967
Watch your tongue,
Carmel Ben Tovim!

01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:37.928
Ignoring my client's answers,
time and again.

01:23:38.596 --> 01:23:41.265
I know how to talk, too, Shimon.

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:48.480
How long have you thought
about leaving this man?

01:23:50.775 --> 01:23:53.152
Seriously, about 10 years.

01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:56.113
- For 10 years he's ignored your wishes.
- Yes.

01:23:58.408 --> 01:23:59.783
And not seriously?

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.871
From the day we married,

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:05.122
my whole life.

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:08.500
Why did you marry?

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:14.048
Why?

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:17.676
Because.

01:24:18.511 --> 01:24:21.096
That's life.
We got married.

01:24:24.434 --> 01:24:27.728
Viviane, why did you stay with him?

01:24:28.104 --> 01:24:30.272
I didn't want to break up the family.

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:36.779
Have you been a good wife?

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:40.657
Make her answer!

01:24:40.825 --> 01:24:42.076
Sit!

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:43.619
Answer, madam.

01:24:49.542 --> 01:24:52.086
I don't think
I've been a good wife to him.

01:24:52.253 --> 01:24:55.255
I wanted things
he couldn't give me.

01:24:59.135 --> 01:25:00.135
Did you love him?

01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:02.679
Yes.

01:25:03.056 --> 01:25:04.807
I wanted us to be happy.

01:25:08.978 --> 01:25:10.479
Viviane Amsalem,

01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:12.898
how long has your husband

01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:15.150
not come to you?

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:21.949
A long time.

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:23.575
How long?

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.374
A long time.

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:31.917
How long?

01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:35.921
How long is a long time?

01:25:41.052 --> 01:25:42.469
You wanted and he refused?

01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:48.475
Viviane, I'm asking,

01:25:49.018 --> 01:25:51.019
did you want it and he refused?

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:57.109
A long time, Carmel.

01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:58.986
We haven't had relations
in many years.

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:05.200
No more questions, Your Honor.

01:26:06.369 --> 01:26:08.245
Your Honors, if I may.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.455
No relations for a long time?

01:26:10.623 --> 01:26:13.750
- He says you don't want to.
- He can say whatever he wants.

01:26:13.918 --> 01:26:15.711
Interesting.

01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:19.131
- And when he wanted it, did you agree?
- No.

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:20.549
There you have it!

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:23.427
She didn't want to.
You admit it?

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:26.054
Still, you have four children.

01:26:26.389 --> 01:26:28.390
Explain! We want to understand.

01:26:29.642 --> 01:26:30.893
Speak up, Mrs. Amsalem.

01:26:33.271 --> 01:26:35.314
- Answer, madam.
- What should I say?

01:26:35.481 --> 01:26:38.358
How we had four children?
Nothing to tell.

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:39.943
Your Honor, we have grounds.

01:26:40.111 --> 01:26:40.944
She's lying.

01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:43.197
It's her word against his.

01:26:45.074 --> 01:26:46.575
Want the truth, Shimon?

01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:48.952
I'll tell you, if you insist.

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.078
Yes, my sister.

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:54.374
Don't call me your sister
and then curse me.

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:55.792
Enough hypocrisy!

01:26:58.421 --> 01:27:01.215
Do you think I liked
living with your mother?

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:03.550
No. I suffered.

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:05.385
She made me suffer.

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:10.098
And I suffered when
he kept me away from my family,

01:27:10.266 --> 01:27:12.643
and from my friends.
That he never said to me:

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:15.938
"My wife, how are you?

01:27:16.105 --> 01:27:20.442
Are you sad today? Are you happy?
How was your day?"

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:25.113
That he never touched me,

01:27:25.865 --> 01:27:28.992
never held me,
neither at night nor in the day.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.495
Not in front of others, not at all.

01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:34.873
I respected him, Shimon,

01:27:35.041 --> 01:27:36.416
and you know it.

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:39.795
But he was never satisfied. Never.

01:27:39.963 --> 01:27:43.340
Neither what I cooked
nor what I did.

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:46.343
He'd come into the kitchen
and criticize.

01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:47.803
Always unhappy.

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:50.639
He wouldn't eat what I cooked.

01:27:51.849 --> 01:27:53.267
As if to punish me,

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:54.977
to insult me.

01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:59.106
He always found a reason
to offend me, to ruin things.

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:04.152
Your brother hates me, Shimon.

01:28:05.363 --> 01:28:06.780
He hates me.

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.284
He hates me, Your Honor.

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:13.495
All he wants is
to see me unhappy.

01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:18.041
Until he sees me torn to pieces,
down on my knees,

01:28:18.209 --> 01:28:19.710
he won't be satisfied.

01:28:21.671 --> 01:28:23.505
And even that won't be enough.

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:52.951
What are you looking
at me for?

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:03.628
You're in love with this woman.

01:29:05.089 --> 01:29:08.050
You cannot hide your feelings.

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:11.595
You're as clear as water.

01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:13.638
Your Honor,

01:29:13.806 --> 01:29:17.059
I ask that you disqualify
Carmel Ben Tovim

01:29:17.643 --> 01:29:19.895
since under the circumstances
he cannot serve as her advocate.

01:29:20.063 --> 01:29:21.313
I love this woman?!

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:23.774
I don't love her,
she's just--

01:29:23.941 --> 01:29:26.818
You don't love this woman?

01:29:26.986 --> 01:29:27.778
No.

01:29:27.945 --> 01:29:30.489
I don't love her
in the way you're implying.

01:29:30.656 --> 01:29:32.491
Then how do you love her?

01:29:32.909 --> 01:29:34.409
How?
What are you saying?

01:29:34.577 --> 01:29:36.912
Who said I love her?
Vivianne Amsalem is--

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.747
Carmel Ben Tovim.

01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:41.541
Is it true that you love this woman?

01:29:48.132 --> 01:29:49.466
This is turning into...

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:52.969
You're all out of your minds.

01:29:53.137 --> 01:29:57.599
Your Honor, I urge you,
put an end to this farce.

01:29:57.975 --> 01:30:00.477
- I call you to order!
- Excuse me?

01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:03.522
You're abetting a denial of justice.

01:30:03.689 --> 01:30:05.690
- Shut up.
- You aren't judging honestly.

01:30:05.858 --> 01:30:09.820
- Shut up!
- You could have set her free long ago.

01:30:09.987 --> 01:30:12.489
So she could bask in her delights?

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.075
Carmel, is it true?

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:18.453
Your Honor, I'm warning you,

01:30:18.621 --> 01:30:21.039
you're dishonoring me.

01:30:21.207 --> 01:30:23.667
You're risking the offense of slander.

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:24.543
Shut up!

01:30:25.002 --> 01:30:27.504
I'll sue this court!

01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:28.630
Shut up, I said.

01:30:28.798 --> 01:30:29.840
Rabbi Solomon,

01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:33.510
your judgment is biased.
You're a dishonest judge.

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.178
Disqualify yourself...

01:30:39.142 --> 01:30:40.517
Your Honor, disqualify yourself!

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:41.768
Shut up!

01:30:55.658 --> 01:30:57.325
I've had enough.

01:31:02.665 --> 01:31:04.458
Find yourselves another judge.

01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:38.825
THREE MONTHS LATER

01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:48.752
Rabbi Shimon,
is your brother going to appear?

01:31:50.588 --> 01:31:52.756
I don't know, Your Honor.

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:54.508
He said he'd come.

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:58.094
My brother, unfortunately...

01:31:58.262 --> 01:31:59.763
isn't talking to me.

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:02.682
He isn't speaking with you?

01:32:03.267 --> 01:32:06.394
How can you represent him
if he isn't talking to you?

01:32:07.396 --> 01:32:11.149
He didn't ask me to quit
representing him, explicitly.

01:32:12.318 --> 01:32:14.110
I'll say this once,

01:32:14.278 --> 01:32:16.905
bring your brother,
or he'll go to jail.

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:20.867
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:32.420
TWO MONTHS LATER

01:32:35.132 --> 01:32:38.718
Amsalems, please rise.

01:32:53.192 --> 01:32:57.654
Elisha Amsalem,
did you enjoy jail?

01:32:57.822 --> 01:33:00.323
- No, Your Honor.
- Of course not.

01:33:00.491 --> 01:33:05.620
But since you missed three hearings,
you left me no choice.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:07.998
But here you are.

01:33:08.165 --> 01:33:09.791
All's well that ends well,

01:33:10.334 --> 01:33:11.668
and I'm glad.

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:15.005
Where is your advocate,
Rabbi Shimon Amsalem?

01:33:16.966 --> 01:33:19.217
- I'll speak for myself.
- So be it.

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:23.430
What we need to do today
is just a formality.

01:33:23.889 --> 01:33:27.309
After much consideration
and in light of events,

01:33:27.977 --> 01:33:31.521
it was decided by a majority
of three judges under my authority

01:33:31.689 --> 01:33:36.067
that you, Elisha Amsalem,
must grant this woman

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:37.736
a divorce.

01:33:44.201 --> 01:33:45.285
Thank you.

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:46.661
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:33:49.206 --> 01:33:51.207
I'll begin by asking:

01:33:51.667 --> 01:33:53.168
Elisha Amsalem,

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:56.880
are you, Viviane Amsalem's husband,

01:33:57.048 --> 01:33:58.923
after these many hearings,

01:33:59.091 --> 01:34:03.094
and having been obligated
to do so by this court,

01:34:03.262 --> 01:34:05.513
willing to grant this woman a divorce

01:34:05.681 --> 01:34:06.890
and repudiate her?

01:34:09.935 --> 01:34:10.935
No, Your Honor.

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:12.937
No? Elisha?

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:14.981
No.

01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:16.483
People,

01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:18.610
I thought you made a decision!

01:34:19.236 --> 01:34:21.905
So did I.
I ask to interrogate the defendant.

01:34:22.073 --> 01:34:23.156
Speak up!

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:28.870
Elisha Amsalem,
is it true that we met,

01:34:29.038 --> 01:34:33.208
you, your brother Shimon and me,
in prison?

01:34:33.376 --> 01:34:34.084
Yes.

01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:37.045
And what was said at that meeting?

01:34:39.298 --> 01:34:44.052
Is it true that you stated
before me and your brother

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:46.596
that if the court obliges you
to divorce, you will?

01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:47.639
Yes.

01:34:47.807 --> 01:34:50.266
- So what happened?
- I changed my mind.

01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:53.937
- He changed his mind, what do you say?
- What do you want me to say?

01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:56.314
My hands are tied.

01:34:56.482 --> 01:35:00.694
I demand that the court sentence
the husband to six months in jail.

01:35:01.237 --> 01:35:02.779
Maimonides said:

01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:04.656
"Force him until he says: I wish it.

01:35:04.824 --> 01:35:07.117
Lash him to his last breath."

01:35:07.284 --> 01:35:08.368
People,

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:10.745
this court has had enough of you.

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:15.250
Come back with a solution
or don't come back at all, now get out.

01:35:15.418 --> 01:35:17.168
No. Why?

01:35:17.336 --> 01:35:18.253
Listen to me.

01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:21.464
This hearing is adjourned.

01:35:21.841 --> 01:35:23.508
Notice will be sent by mail.

01:35:23.926 --> 01:35:25.969
Why are you making me
run around in circles?

01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:28.847
Why, Your Honor?
Why?

01:35:29.014 --> 01:35:31.474
Why have I come in and out
for years now

01:35:31.642 --> 01:35:32.892
and nothing's changed?

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:33.935
Why?

01:35:34.103 --> 01:35:37.480
You can't force him to divorce
nor to appear,

01:35:37.648 --> 01:35:40.316
and you can't this or that,
and what about me?

01:35:40.484 --> 01:35:42.819
When will you see me?

01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:46.197
When I'm too exhausted
to stand before you?

01:35:46.657 --> 01:35:47.449
When?

01:35:48.117 --> 01:35:51.327
If it were up to you,
it could go on for 10 years.

01:35:51.495 --> 01:35:55.373
I could drop dead in front of you
and all you'd see was him!

01:35:55.958 --> 01:35:58.543
But nobody is above the law.

01:35:58.711 --> 01:36:03.673
There's a God and there's justice
and He'll judge you as you judge me.

01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:05.925
Mercilessly.

01:36:06.469 --> 01:36:08.636
You don't care about me!

01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:13.016
In America,
if a man doesn't show up twice in a row,

01:36:13.184 --> 01:36:14.100
it's over!

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:17.687
They divorce him,
whether he's there or not!

01:36:17.855 --> 01:36:21.524
If he doesn't honor the law,
the law doesn't honor him!

01:36:21.692 --> 01:36:24.569
And who do you honor?

01:36:25.237 --> 01:36:28.239
For God's sake, have you no fear?

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:31.159
So send me to hell.

01:36:31.327 --> 01:36:33.369
Go to hell, too!

01:36:33.662 --> 01:36:35.246
Enough!

01:36:36.123 --> 01:36:37.290
Goddamn it!

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:39.542
Enough!
This lady has finished.

01:36:39.710 --> 01:36:42.378
No, I haven't!

01:36:42.546 --> 01:36:45.715
One day someone will take
the power from your hands.

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:49.385
What will you have left?
Conversions?

01:36:49.678 --> 01:36:51.846
No one will want that either.

01:36:52.014 --> 01:36:52.931
It's over.

01:36:53.432 --> 01:36:56.559
Skullcaps on your heads?
Rabbinical court!

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:59.020
Shitty court!

01:36:59.188 --> 01:36:59.979
Are you cursing?

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:02.732
Shitty job.
Shitty people!

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.776
I suspend this woman from court

01:37:04.944 --> 01:37:06.402
for 24 months.

01:37:06.904 --> 01:37:09.906
- I'm the idiot!
- Disgrace and infamy.

01:37:11.826 --> 01:37:14.911
A woman like her
should go back to her husband,

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:17.080
if he's still willing!

01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:29.217
TWO MONTHS LATER

01:37:42.898 --> 01:37:44.482
Speak up, Ben Tovim.

01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:48.403
Welcome back, Your Honor.

01:37:49.822 --> 01:37:52.657
We were worried about you.

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:54.617
For your well-being.

01:37:55.452 --> 01:37:59.038
My client also sends her regards.

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:00.707
She's here?

01:38:01.876 --> 01:38:04.711
She's outside... waiting.

01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:07.213
How can I help you?

01:38:07.798 --> 01:38:09.299
See her.

01:38:10.801 --> 01:38:12.010
Hear her.

01:38:18.893 --> 01:38:20.143
I can't.

01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:24.188
My colleague ruled,
and I must respect his ruling.

01:38:26.609 --> 01:38:29.986
- Your Honor...
- Final judgment, Carmel.

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:33.615
If you don't like it,
file an appeal.

01:38:40.623 --> 01:38:44.667
FOUR MONTHS LATER

01:38:54.970 --> 01:38:56.387
Appellants only.

01:39:00.184 --> 01:39:00.934
Come in.

01:39:01.101 --> 01:39:02.185
The advocates.

01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:08.358
Thank you for seeing me,
Your Honor.

01:39:08.651 --> 01:39:14.697
I know that my client is still suspended
but there are new developments.

01:39:14.865 --> 01:39:16.366
Speak up, Carmel.

01:39:16.533 --> 01:39:19.410
The husband wants to grant a divorce.

01:39:20.412 --> 01:39:22.956
Be merciful and see them.

01:39:23.499 --> 01:39:27.126
How do you know
this isn't another trick?

01:39:27.294 --> 01:39:29.253
He approached us.

01:39:29.421 --> 01:39:30.755
I understand.

01:39:51.694 --> 01:39:54.195
The boys came over last night.

01:39:54.363 --> 01:39:56.531
Evyatar started his new job.

01:40:00.077 --> 01:40:00.994
Really?

01:40:05.624 --> 01:40:09.419
He told me a week ago
that he doesn't want to do it.

01:40:12.756 --> 01:40:13.881
Did it go well?

01:40:14.049 --> 01:40:16.551
Yes. He's happy, thank God.

01:40:22.391 --> 01:40:24.142
And how are you, Viviane?

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:26.561
I'm fine.

01:40:31.483 --> 01:40:33.359
How much do you smoke a day?

01:40:33.652 --> 01:40:34.652
Not much.

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:35.903
How much?

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:42.994
I don't count.

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:48.666
Viviane...

01:41:35.172 --> 01:41:41.552
THE NEXT DAY
FIVE YEARS SINCE THE TRIAL BEGAN

01:41:59.530 --> 01:42:01.364
Witnesses, go ahead.

01:42:32.604 --> 01:42:34.188
Please, come in.

01:42:38.443 --> 01:42:40.945
Give me the divorce papers,
please.

01:42:42.739 --> 01:42:43.698
Thank you.

01:42:48.745 --> 01:42:52.456
Mrs. Amsalem,
come stand here.

01:42:57.963 --> 01:43:01.424
Hold your elbows against your sides.

01:43:02.551 --> 01:43:04.844
Put your hands together.

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:08.347
No, not like that.
Parallel to the floor.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:14.395
Your husband will place
the divorce papers in your hands.

01:43:15.564 --> 01:43:17.190
And when it is...

01:43:17.357 --> 01:43:19.317
Not like that, cup your hands.

01:43:19.484 --> 01:43:21.694
Do as I say, cup your hands.

01:43:22.404 --> 01:43:26.115
And when the divorce papers
are in your hands

01:43:26.283 --> 01:43:29.493
you'll close both hands
around the divorce papers,

01:43:29.661 --> 01:43:33.247
place them under your arm,
walk to the door

01:43:33.415 --> 01:43:34.248
and back,

01:43:34.416 --> 01:43:36.918
and thus you buy your divorce.

01:43:37.836 --> 01:43:43.132
You, Elisha Amsalem,
take the divorce papers.

01:43:43.967 --> 01:43:47.637
Hold the divorce papers
over her hands.

01:43:47.804 --> 01:43:51.390
I'll recite and you'll repeat after me
and when finished,

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:56.062
you'll place the divorce papers
in her hands and let them go.

01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:57.855
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

01:43:58.023 --> 01:43:59.148
Repeat after me.

01:43:59.316 --> 01:44:01.234
"This is your divorce."

01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:03.319
This is your divorce.

01:44:03.487 --> 01:44:06.197
"Which you receive from me."

01:44:06.365 --> 01:44:08.699
Which you receive from me.

01:44:08.867 --> 01:44:12.662
"And you are hereby divorced
from me hereafter."

01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:17.375
And you are hereby divorced
from me hereafter.

01:44:18.627 --> 01:44:21.545
"And you are hereby permitted
to any man."

01:44:27.636 --> 01:44:32.056
"And you are hereby permitted
to any man."

01:44:39.273 --> 01:44:40.815
Repeat after me.

01:44:42.025 --> 01:44:43.442
Repeat after him.

01:44:43.819 --> 01:44:47.196
"And you are hereby permitted
to any man."

01:44:48.532 --> 01:44:50.116
Elisha, say it.

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:52.326
Please don't interrupt.

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:53.703
Tell her:

01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:56.956
"And you are hereby permitted
to any man."

01:45:09.553 --> 01:45:10.344
I...

01:45:10.512 --> 01:45:15.266
- I can't do it.
- What can't you do?!

01:45:15.434 --> 01:45:20.479
Take this couple out of here.
I never want to see them again.

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:21.981
Take them out now.

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.816
- Take them out now!
- Madam, let's go.

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:27.320
Send them out now!

01:45:27.487 --> 01:45:29.030
Madam, let's go.

01:45:30.449 --> 01:45:32.158
Viviane, come here.

01:45:34.286 --> 01:45:35.995
Please talk to him.

01:45:36.163 --> 01:45:38.039
Madam, please leave.

01:45:38.206 --> 01:45:39.540
Please go.

01:45:39.708 --> 01:45:41.584
Please talk to him.

01:45:41.752 --> 01:45:44.879
We've done all we can.
Please go.

01:45:45.047 --> 01:45:46.797
Witnesses, lead her out.

01:45:47.758 --> 01:45:48.466
Elisha...

01:45:49.468 --> 01:45:50.259
Take them out.

01:45:50.969 --> 01:45:52.053
Madam, let's go.

01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:53.804
Let's go.

01:45:54.222 --> 01:45:55.765
- Your Honor...
- It's over.

01:45:56.183 --> 01:46:00.019
Witnesses, get this couple
out of my courtroom.

01:46:01.605 --> 01:46:04.815
- May I talk to you?
- There's nothing to talk about.

01:46:04.983 --> 01:46:07.485
Please, take them out.

01:46:08.737 --> 01:46:10.321
Let's go.

01:46:10.489 --> 01:46:12.073
Please let me talk to you.

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:15.409
I don't want to hear you.
Enough!

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:22.500
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're in contempt of court.

01:46:22.667 --> 01:46:24.126
- Out!
- Let's go, madam!

01:46:26.338 --> 01:46:27.797
I'm not moving.

01:46:30.175 --> 01:46:31.592
Let's go, please.

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.178
Let's talk outside.

01:46:35.305 --> 01:46:38.057
- Take this woman out!
- I want my divorce.

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:39.433
Take the desk with her.

01:46:43.146 --> 01:46:44.730
I'm not leaving!

01:46:46.274 --> 01:46:47.483
Elisha.

01:46:55.325 --> 01:46:57.451
Move away.

01:46:57.619 --> 01:47:00.579
I want to talk to my husband.

01:47:02.416 --> 01:47:03.624
Elisha.

01:47:04.501 --> 01:47:05.418
Move back.

01:47:10.674 --> 01:47:13.008
Please!

01:47:14.678 --> 01:47:16.762
Give me my freedom.

01:47:18.682 --> 01:47:21.684
Give me my freedom, please.

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:24.520
Leave me alone!

01:47:24.688 --> 01:47:27.815
It's useless, Viviane, let's go.

01:47:29.276 --> 01:47:32.319
Give me my freedom!

01:47:33.864 --> 01:47:35.865
Give me my divorce.

01:47:36.199 --> 01:47:38.200
Give me, give me!

01:47:38.368 --> 01:47:40.202
Viviane, it's useless.

01:47:43.623 --> 01:47:45.749
Give me my freedom!

01:47:45.917 --> 01:47:47.751
Give me my divorce.

01:47:48.336 --> 01:47:51.714
Don't force her,
she'll go alone.

01:47:52.716 --> 01:47:54.592
It's no use, Viviane.

01:47:54.759 --> 01:47:56.927
He won't give it to you.

01:47:59.097 --> 01:48:00.473
Give me...

01:48:15.363 --> 01:48:18.073
Shimon, tell Viviane
I want to talk to her.

01:48:18.241 --> 01:48:19.033
What?

01:48:19.201 --> 01:48:22.203
I have to talk to her. Please.

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:25.331
Please, Shimon.

01:48:28.502 --> 01:48:32.630
Viviane, Elisha wants to talk to you
in private.

01:48:32.797 --> 01:48:34.048
Not now.

01:48:34.216 --> 01:48:36.008
Just a few minutes.

01:48:36.593 --> 01:48:38.552
Please. Do you agree?

01:48:48.146 --> 01:48:49.396
You'll give it to me?

01:48:54.694 --> 01:48:58.155
Don't mess with me.

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:00.241
I'll give it to you.

01:49:02.786 --> 01:49:05.746
And you, Viviane,
what will you give me?

01:49:12.128 --> 01:49:13.128
What do you want?

01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:30.646
Elisha,

01:49:32.899 --> 01:49:34.650
that's what matters to you?

01:49:35.944 --> 01:49:37.444
That's what you want?

01:49:41.658 --> 01:49:43.367
Why ask such a thing of me?

01:49:43.535 --> 01:49:44.952
I don't want to lose you.

01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:47.079
It's already over.

01:49:47.497 --> 01:49:48.998
I love you.

01:50:06.516 --> 01:50:07.808
All right, Elisha.

01:50:10.895 --> 01:50:12.521
As you wish.

01:50:14.482 --> 01:50:16.859
There'll be no one after you.

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:20.362
- You'll give me my freedom?
- I will.

01:50:33.835 --> 01:50:35.502
Do forgive me, Viviane.

01:50:50.101 --> 01:50:51.101
Are you sure?

01:50:57.651 --> 01:50:58.817
Yes.

01:51:19.172 --> 01:51:20.130
All right.

01:51:22.175 --> 01:51:24.051
Witnesses, come in.
