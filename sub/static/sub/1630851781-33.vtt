Can't forget

My skateboard?

07:28.015 --> 07:29.149
It's gone!

- Aww.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.601
I'd better call Rox.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.103
She's probably wondering
where you are.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.256
- And we'll stay here.
Right, Birdie?

09:49.322 --> 09:50.991
Birdie?

09:52.760 --> 09:56.029
A lost bunny and now
a lost Birdie too?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.165
Wait for me!

09:58.231 --> 10:00.734
- Whoo-hee-hee!
- Whoa!

10:03.603 --> 10:05.939
- Beep, beep!

10:06.006 --> 10:08.041
Violet?

10:08.108 --> 10:09.542
[chuckles]

10:11.111 --> 10:12.512
- Excuse me, Timmy.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.247
- Birdie?
- Violet, come back!

10:14.314 --> 10:15.849
- She went that way.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.150
- Thanks, Timmy!

10:18.185 --> 10:19.987
- [panting]

10:20.854 --> 10:24.858
- Hmm. I wonder where
everyone's going.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.026
Whoa!

10:26.093 --> 10:28.461
- Whee!

10:28.528 --> 10:30.630

[barks] Violet!

10:33.400 --> 10:35.568
- [panting]

10:35.635 --> 10:37.504
Which way did she go?

10:37.570 --> 10:39.472
Time to call Sunny.
[dialing beeps]

10:43.043 --> 10:44.544
[phone ringing]

10:46.446 --> 10:48.615
- Hey, Rox,
did you find Violet?

10:48.682 --> 10:51.351
- No,
she's completely disappeared!

10:51.418 --> 10:53.086
- We can't find her either.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.487
- Uh, Sunny?

10:54.554 --> 10:56.056
- Whoo-hoo!

10:56.123 --> 10:57.557
Fun!

10:57.624 --> 10:59.893
- [barks]
- Nice moves.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.695
- [giggles] Whoa!

11:01.762 --> 11:03.764
- Ooh, and a nice hat.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.498
- Rox, we found her.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.768
She's heading down Main Street.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.404
- Update!
She's heading up Main Street.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.941
- Whee!
- Update on that update:

11:14.007 --> 11:15.943
she's heading right towards us!

11:16.009 --> 11:17.310
[all exclaim]

11:17.377 --> 11:19.813

Whoo-hoo!

11:25.285 --> 11:26.586
- Violet!
- Whoo!

11:26.653 --> 11:28.155
both: Whoa!

- [sighs]

11:30.457 --> 11:32.692
[gasps] Whoa.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.662
- [panting] Hey, Violet!

11:35.729 --> 11:37.164
- Whoo-hoo!
- Have you seen Birdie--

11:37.230 --> 11:38.665
Whoa! Whoa! Oh!

11:38.732 --> 11:40.567
- Look out, Peter!
- Uh, Rox, I was--

11:40.633 --> 11:42.102
- Sorry, Peter, gotta go!

11:42.169 --> 11:44.337

12:02.022 --> 12:03.156
Huh?

12:04.357 --> 12:05.826
[chuckles]

12:06.994 --> 12:08.261
- Whoa!

12:09.296 --> 12:10.964
Violet!

12:11.031 --> 12:12.265
Oh, no.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.034
Where'd Violet go now?

12:15.535 --> 12:17.905
Sunny.
- Rox, get in.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.174
- Let's go!

12:23.877 --> 12:26.679
- [sniffing]
Don't worry, Violet.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.116
I'll find ya.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.318
[sniffing]

12:31.384 --> 12:34.621

Wait for me!

12:42.395 --> 12:43.663
[sighs]

12:44.164 --> 12:46.499
I'll just catch up
with you in a minute.

Oh!
[gasps]

13:09.456 --> 13:11.925
Ah! Flower monster!

13:13.360 --> 13:14.828
- Timmy?

13:17.530 --> 13:19.666
- Still no sign of Violet.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.235
- [gasps]
There is one sign.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.674
- Violet's hat!

13:27.740 --> 13:30.277
- We're getting closer.
Come on!

13:34.547 --> 13:37.717
- [sniffing]

13:39.352 --> 13:41.554
- Got ya!
Birdie?

13:41.621 --> 13:43.556
What are you doing out here?

13:43.623 --> 13:45.758
- Scratch!
Nice to see ya.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.228
Can't stop.
Very important job.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.030
I'm on the trail of a bunny.

13:50.097 --> 13:53.967
- A bunny? We can't have you
wondering around like a stray.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.103
Let's get you back to Peter.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.372
- No can do.
I've got a bunny to find.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.974
Gotta go.
- Wait!

14:01.041 --> 14:03.043
Birdie!
[van approaching]

14:04.044 --> 14:06.346
- Hi, Scratch.
Have you seen Violet?

14:06.413 --> 14:09.116
- Bunny? Fluffy?
Yea big?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.384
- No, I haven't seen
any bunnies,

14:11.451 --> 14:13.353
but I'm not a bunny catcher.

14:13.420 --> 14:17.657
I'm a dog catcher, and that's
a pretty hard job on its own.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.727
- Ya-hoo-hoo-hoo.
- [gasps]

14:20.793 --> 14:22.829
Looks like Scratch
is a bunny catcher.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.564
There she is!

14:24.631 --> 14:26.199
- Let's go!

14:27.667 --> 14:29.869

I'm a dog catcher *

* [humming] I catch dogs *

14:34.107 --> 14:35.375
- [grunts]

14:35.442 --> 14:36.409
Huh?

14:36.476 --> 14:37.677
Ooh.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.079
Yum!

14:41.714 --> 14:43.016
[grunts]

14:49.022 --> 14:52.559
- There's Scratch's truck.
We're coming, Violet.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.094
- Ooh [babbles]

14:54.161 --> 14:55.528
Nom!
[teeth clatter]

14:55.595 --> 14:57.197
Ugh, yuck!

14:59.632 --> 15:01.068
Huh.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.906
Flower, yum!

15:09.876 --> 15:12.679
- Come on, KC.
Keep up.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.983
- [murmuring nervously]

15:19.752 --> 15:22.322
Ooh.
[panting]

15:22.389 --> 15:23.823
[chuckles]

15:27.560 --> 15:28.695
- Hello!

15:28.761 --> 15:30.930
- Ah! Oh, whoa!
- Whoa!

15:30.998 --> 15:33.333
- Whoa-oh-oh!
- Oh.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.567
- [exclaims]

15:34.634 --> 15:35.935
Huh, cute.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.338
[all gasp]
- Whoa! Look out!

15:38.405 --> 15:40.340
- [gasps]
- Fun!

15:40.407 --> 15:41.608
Whee!

15:41.674 --> 15:43.476
[clattering]

15:44.944 --> 15:47.014
- [groans]
It's okay.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.116
I'm okay.
- [giggling]

15:49.182 --> 15:51.118
- Ah!
- You're so cute!

15:51.184 --> 15:54.621
Yes, you are!
You're the cutest little bunny!

15:54.687 --> 15:56.589
- Hello?
What about me?

15:56.656 --> 15:58.491
Cute doggie here.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.460
- KC, we're taking her home.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.495
Violet's my bunny now.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.264
- But--but--but-but-but!

16:06.566 --> 16:09.436
- Fun!
Whee!

16:13.240 --> 16:16.143
- [gasps] There's Scratch,
up ahead!

16:17.844 --> 16:19.412
- [groans]

16:21.114 --> 16:23.783
- Oh, there's Lacey and KC
and Violet.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.053
Wait.
Violet?

16:29.089 --> 16:32.092
Violet, I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.727
- Sorry, Rox, finders keepers!

16:34.794 --> 16:36.329
- Hello!

16:38.931 --> 16:40.733
- Hey!
- Lacey.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.369
Violet's my bunny.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.003
You can't take her.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.939
- Hm. If Violet were my pet,
I'd never lose her.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.808
- Hey! We lost Violet!

16:48.875 --> 16:49.909
- [grumbles]

16:49.976 --> 16:52.579
- Again?
Violet! Violet!

16:52.645 --> 16:54.914
- Here, bunny, bunny, bunny!

16:54.981 --> 16:57.217
- We'll never find her now.

16:57.284 --> 17:00.019
- Never say never.
[carnival music playing]

17:00.087 --> 17:01.154
[Violet chatters]
- [gasps]

17:01.221 --> 17:03.456
Look!
- Whoo-hoo!

17:04.023 --> 17:06.159
- Whoa, that looks
just like Violet

17:06.226 --> 17:07.760
on top of the Ferris Wheel.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.763
- [giggles] Hello!

17:10.830 --> 17:13.866
- That is Violet
on top of the Ferris Wheel.

17:13.933 --> 17:16.002
- Well, she's seems
happy up there,

17:16.069 --> 17:18.438
and I'm ready
for my dinner, so--

17:18.505 --> 17:21.040
[uneasy chuckle]
Never mind!

17:22.775 --> 17:24.744
- [giggles]

17:24.811 --> 17:26.779
- We have to go and rescue her.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.282
both: Let's go! Hey.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.483
- She's my bunny!

17:30.550 --> 17:31.751
- Was your bunny.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.886
- But--
- Let's all go.

17:36.323 --> 17:38.358
* *

17:38.425 --> 17:41.894
- Did Violet get smaller or
is she just really far away?

17:41.961 --> 17:45.232
- [giggling]

17:45.298 --> 17:47.300
- It's okay.
She's Violet-sized again.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.536
- How are we gonna get
her down?

17:49.602 --> 17:52.805
- [barks] I'll get you Violet.
- Oh, no, Rosie.

17:52.872 --> 17:56.376
- [panting, barking]

17:56.443 --> 17:58.378
- You stay here with me.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.681
- [gasps]

18:01.748 --> 18:02.849
Ah-ha!

18:02.915 --> 18:04.651
Maybe we can stop the wheel.

18:04.717 --> 18:05.985
both: I'll do it.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.020
No, I'll do it!

18:09.256 --> 18:12.292
- She's my bunny.
- No, she's my bunny.

18:12.359 --> 18:15.061
[both grunting]

18:15.862 --> 18:18.831
[powering down]
both: Oops.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.503
- Well, I'm all out of ideas.

18:23.570 --> 18:27.340
- But we can't give up.
We have to save Violet.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.075
- [giggles]

18:29.142 --> 18:32.945
- If we can't get Violet down,
then we'll have to go up.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.682
- I'll do it.
Violet's my bunny.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.550
- Are you sure, Rox?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.219
- Absolutely.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.555
- Then here.
These will help you hold tight.

18:45.091 --> 18:47.527
- Yeah!
- [grunting]

18:47.594 --> 18:49.596
I'm coming for you, Violet.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.599
- Everyone, grab a hold.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.803
[all gasps]

18:56.869 --> 18:58.571
- You can do it, Rox!
- [gasps]

18:58.638 --> 19:00.006
- You're almost there!

19:00.072 --> 19:01.908
- Keep going!

19:02.809 --> 19:05.712
- [grunting]
- Oh. Aw.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.249
- Violet!
Don't you ever run off again.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.984
Do you know how worried
I've been?

19:12.051 --> 19:15.054
Aw. I'm so glad
to have you back.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.257
I've missed
my quality bunny time.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.525
- Aw.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.961
- So now Violet and Rox
are at the top.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.663
How does this help us again?

19:23.730 --> 19:26.065
- Yeah, what's the plan here?

19:26.132 --> 19:29.669
- I don't think I can climb
down and carry Violet.

19:29.736 --> 19:33.072
- Rox, your bunny ears!
I have an idea.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.174
Let the ribbons down.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.610
- Here you go!

19:41.714 --> 19:44.150
- One skateboard, coming up!

19:47.320 --> 19:50.857
- Uh, how is having a
skateboard up here gonna help?

19:50.923 --> 19:53.059
- Uh, I don't know.

19:53.125 --> 19:56.429
- Rox, tie the ribbons
to the Ferris Wheel.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.632
- Almost done!

19:59.699 --> 20:01.167
There.

20:02.669 --> 20:06.439
- Here. Pull these out as far
and tight as you can.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.744
- Still not seeing the plan.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.646
- Get ready, Rox!

20:16.416 --> 20:19.519
- Oh, I get it.
A ribbon ramp.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.020
We can ride down.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.922
- Ooh, fun.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.824
- Aw! That's my Sunny.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.059
She made a ramp.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.229
- All ready down here, Rox.

20:30.297 --> 20:33.466
- Okay, Violet.
Hold on tight.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.668
both: Whoo!

20:35.735 --> 20:37.637
- Whee!
- Whee! [laughs]

20:37.704 --> 20:38.871
- Whoo!

20:38.938 --> 20:40.707
- Whee! [laughs]

20:40.773 --> 20:42.008
both: Oh!

20:42.709 --> 20:44.210
- Oh, no, Violet!

20:44.277 --> 20:46.012
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

20:46.078 --> 20:47.447
- Violet!

20:49.081 --> 20:51.618
- Hey! We found her!

20:51.684 --> 20:54.687
[all cheering]

20:54.754 --> 20:56.222
- Yahoo!

20:57.790 --> 20:59.158
- Thanks, Peter.

20:59.225 --> 21:01.227
Thanks, Birdie.
- [giggling]

21:01.294 --> 21:03.396
Whoo, oh.
- Aw.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.198
- I guess she is your bunny.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.402
That's okay.
I already have a great pet.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.904
And KC's not as hard
to keep up with.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.573
- Thanks?

21:18.144 --> 21:21.648
- [sighs] I'm so glad to have
you back, Violet.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.684
From now on when you
want to have fun

21:24.751 --> 21:27.754
we'll have fun together.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.391
[giggles] After your nap.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.892
- [sighs]

21:32.959 --> 21:34.994
- [yawns] And mine.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.530
[laughter]

21:38.931 --> 21:40.633
- [sighs]

21:40.700 --> 21:42.535
- Hi, it's me, Sunny

21:42.602 --> 21:45.805
with another look
inside the Style Files.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.040
Check out those bunny ears.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.942
What a sunny bunny!

21:50.009 --> 21:54.347
For this hairstyle and more,
check out the Nick Jr. app.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.318
Keep smiling.
Keep styling.

21:59.386 --> 22:03.656
[laughs]

22:03.723 --> 22:10.930

22:30.750 --> 22:31.551

It's me Sunny
