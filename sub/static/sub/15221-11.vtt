<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped</i>
<i>into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.908 --> 00:10.842
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.448 --> 00:18.042
<i>He awoke to find himself</i>
<i>trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.118 --> 00:21.713
<i>facing mirror images</i>
<i>that were not his own...</i>

00:21.788 --> 00:25.918

<i>to change history for the better.</i>

00:27.093 --> 00:31.029
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,</i>
<i>an observer from his own time,</i>

<i>who appears in the form of a hologram</i>
<i>that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.803 --> 00:41.103

I can well imagine that

02:59.579 --> 03:02.104
Neil, your father has been
dead for three years,

03:02.182 --> 03:04.275

Don't say it.

03:58.771 --> 04:01.740
Say what?

04:01.808 --> 04:05.972
That Neil looks
a little older than 1 9.

04:06.045 --> 04:09.811
Actually, no, he looks
a lot more like 30.

04:09.882 --> 04:13.511
<i>That's because he is 30.</i>

Why don't you ask her?

- I am not going to ask her. You ask her.
- Ask me what?

04:58.564 --> 05:03.695
- Uh, how you like New York

- I'm having the time of my life.

Everybody misses you,Jane,

I miss you too.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.224
And even though you've made
a lot of new friends here,

06:37.296 --> 06:40.629
there's no friends like-

06:40.700 --> 06:44.158
like old friends at home.

06:45.671 --> 06:47.969
Liz, what are you trying to say?

06:48.040 --> 06:53.137
Well,just that it must be nice
to have someone so young
paying attention to you.

Oh,Joe is the best thing
that's happened to me

Please, be happy for me.
Oh, I want to,Jane.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.410
I really do, but-
But what?

07:02.488 --> 07:08.120
Well, it's just that I always pictured you
with someone who's old enough to vote.

07:14.066 --> 07:16.330
What did you do
before you were an actor?

07:16.402 --> 07:20.600
Uh, this and that.
Hmm.

07:20.673 --> 07:24.473
Did you go to school?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Oh, you bet I did.

07:24.544 --> 07:27.536
How was your trip out?
Which school did you go to?

Which school did I go to?
I went to, uh-

I went to a lot of different schools.

07:34.220 --> 07:38.054

Uh, darling.

<i>Nixon ran against</i>
<i>Hubert Humphrey last year.</i>

You've been voting since

08:02.114 --> 08:04.139
Right. I voted for
Johnson and Goldwater.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.583
You know, I am tired.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.722
Why don't we go back
to the hotel and freshen up?

08:10.790 --> 08:12.724
We're staying at the Hampstead.

08:12.792 --> 08:16.250
And tonight we'd like to
take you someplace special.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.263
Uh-
Your choice.

Of course she fell for him.

08:38.251 --> 08:41.277
Maybe he just likes her voice.
It is possible, you know.

08:41.354 --> 08:45.450
Yes. Yes. So is my dancing <i>Swan Lake</i>
in a tutu, but highly unlikely.

08:46.726 --> 08:51.891
And did you see
that outfit she had on?
She's in love and you're jealous.

Jealous? Jealous?
Liz, he's five years younger than me.

08:55.368 --> 09:00.067
What could he possibly see in her?
Neil, your mother
is a wonderful woman.

She lied to me.
They're shacking up.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.906
She's lost it.
I swear, she's lost it.

I really wasn't much help, was I?

09:13.786 --> 09:16.812
Oh,Joe, I'm sorry I didn't tell them
that you were living here.

09:16.889 --> 09:20.256
I know how bad
you want to get married
and get this all out in the open,

09:20.326 --> 09:23.887
but, well, maybe it's
just not the right time.

09:23.963 --> 09:27.455
- Okay.
- The kids need more time
to get to know you better, you know?

09:27.533 --> 09:32.698
Well, that's fine.
They can get to know me tonight
at your birthday party.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.969
Birthday party, my foot.
They want me to come back to Cleveland.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.478
Is that what Liz told you?
Well, not in so many words,
but I know it's true.

09:39.545 --> 09:42.207
They think I'm too old
to start singing.

09:42.281 --> 09:45.512
And worse, they think
I'm too old to be in love.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.644
Uh-oh. Look at the time.
You better hurry.
Huh?

09:47.720 --> 09:50.621

- My Danish prince.

<i>I'm so proud of you. The lead</i>
<i>in your first New York production.</i>

In front of people?
Well, okay, so there were only
80 people the opening week,

10:03.436 --> 10:06.928
but even Laurence Olivier
had to start somewhere.

10:07.006 --> 10:09.668

To be, or not... to be.
That is the question.

Oh, no. No, no.

She's much too sophisticated for you.
She's too old for you, Sam.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.989
That's right, it is.
Yeah.

13:47.059 --> 13:51.496
ButJoe, he doesn't go on as Hamlet.
The play gets canceled.

13:51.564 --> 13:55.625
And there's agents in the audience
so he blows his big break.

13:55.701 --> 13:57.635
And his life goes
downhill from there.

13:57.703 --> 14:03.198
He becomes an extra in movies,
and he goes into real estate.

to make sure he goes on
as Hamlet. Gotta be.

Does she ever sing again?

14:13.185 --> 14:17.451

Sing, well, there's nothing
about singing in here.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.754
Uh, she doesn't have a great life.
But at least she's got her family.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.818
You should hear her sing, Al.
I mean, she-she has a terrific voice.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.865

It would be a waste
if she never did anything with it.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.202

Hmm? What?

14:31.270 --> 14:33.830

Or was it my fifth?
Your f-

14:37.376 --> 14:39.401
Yeah, it was the fifth.
It was the fifth.

14:39.478 --> 14:42.641
She always had a dream of skating...

14:43.883 --> 14:45.874
professionally...

14:45.951 --> 14:47.885
in the roller derby.
Roller derby?

14:47.953 --> 14:52.947
Yeah. And it was hard watching her
build her hopes up for those tryouts,

14:53.025 --> 14:55.789
you know, and then fail.

14:55.861 --> 15:00.230
She never got it.
She fell on her tushy all the time.
Al.

15:00.299 --> 15:03.598
So she tried a little ice skating,

15:03.669 --> 15:05.660
but it wasn't the same,
it wasn't the same.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.729
Finally we broke up.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.741
Are you telling me that
you broke up with your fifth wife...

15:11.810 --> 15:16.611
because she couldn't
get into the roller derby game?
No. She ran off with a bricklayer.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.810
I'll tell you though.
Every time I see a roller skate,

15:19.885 --> 15:21.819
I get all choked up.
Al.

15:21.887 --> 15:26.449
It just goes to show you that
some dreams are supposed to
stay up in the clouds.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.790
What are you talking about?
No, you can never give up
on your dreams.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.922
What if you build her up
and she tries and then she fails?

15:32.998 --> 15:34.932
What if she doesn't fall on her tushy?
What if she succeeds?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.934
You can't hit a home run
if you don't come up to the plate.

This isn't you, Mom.

39:28.599 --> 39:31.159
You're not some wild, young singer.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.808
Don't you think it's time
that you came home?

39:47.651 --> 39:50.586
Well, here we are
on the street again.

39:50.654 --> 39:52.884
How come there are
eight billion cabs in New York City,

39:52.957 --> 39:54.891
but you can never find one
when you want one?

39:54.959 --> 39:58.417
It's the Bermuda Triangle,
New York. Never mind.
What?

40:00.564 --> 40:03.556
And how come you didn't tell me earlier
that she was gonna take the train?

40:03.634 --> 40:05.864
I told you as soon as I found out.

40:05.936 --> 40:11.602
Now, listen. What do you think is
gonna happen ifJane starts to sing
for this agent and she can't?

40:12.777 --> 40:14.972
I say she can.
Well, you don't know.

40:15.045 --> 40:17.309
She could be blowing
two careers instead of one.

40:17.381 --> 40:19.474
How do you think she's gonna
feel about that afterwards?

40:19.550 --> 40:21.950
How do you thinkJoe
is gonna feel about that?

40:22.019 --> 40:24.613
J-Joe is gonna feel miserable
if he doesn't help her.

40:26.791 --> 40:29.851
You know, I hate it
when you're right.
[ Ziggy Beeping ]

40:29.927 --> 40:32.418
What?
Uh-oh. Looks like
she's starting to leave, Sam.

40:32.496 --> 40:34.521
Go, go, go.

40:34.598 --> 40:38.090
Come on, shake a leg,Janie.
Shake a leg, come on.

40:39.570 --> 40:41.538
All right, that's it.

40:45.042 --> 40:47.169
Jane! Wait a second! Wait a second!

40:47.244 --> 40:49.644
Oh, no.
You can't run out on me like this.

40:49.713 --> 40:53.376
You gotta give me a chance to explain.
What's to explain?
You're 25.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.614
She's 25. It's only natural.
Yeah, but nothing happened!

40:56.687 --> 40:59.212
I didn't invite Petra to my room.
She invited herself.
<i>Come on, Mom.</i>

40:59.290 --> 41:01.952
If it isn't Petra,
it'll be somebody else.

41:02.026 --> 41:04.688
And then one day
you'll stop turning them down.

41:04.762 --> 41:08.721
I can't compete.
The only thing that sags
on her are her morals.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.666
You're going downhill, Sam.
Look. Look.
What about your career?

41:11.735 --> 41:15.501
If you're not gonna stay here for us,
at least stay for yourself.
Give your career a chance.

41:15.573 --> 41:19.509
I did and I failed.
Look, you only froze once!

41:23.347 --> 41:26.475
<i>Jane.!Jane.! Excuse me.</i>

41:26.550 --> 41:29.417
Jane, listen to me.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.423
Lots of people fail
their first time out.
Don't give up on yourself.

41:33.491 --> 41:37.257
Joe, we have to make a train.
Shut up, Ted.
I'm not talkin' to you.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.195
Now you take
your hands off her-
Or what?

41:40.264 --> 41:44.200
- Or this!
-Joe!

41:44.268 --> 41:46.498
<i>Ted.! Ted, no.! Stop.!</i>
Get up, you draft-dodging-

41:46.570 --> 41:48.504
<i>Stop.! Stop,you two.! Stop it.!</i>

41:48.572 --> 41:51.439
Just leave us alone a minute.
Get in the cab.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.943
Joe, are you all right? Joe.

41:54.011 --> 41:57.174
You're lucky he didn't give you
a flying noodle kick, you nozzle.

41:57.248 --> 42:00.046
I know you think I'm crazy
for going on tonight, but I had to.

42:00.117 --> 42:03.382
A lot of people were depending upon me.
There was an agent in the audience.

42:03.454 --> 42:06.116
Some guy from Rosenfeld and Adams.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.920
And he thinks that I-

42:08.993 --> 42:12.087
that I could be the next Boxer Boy.

42:12.162 --> 42:15.222
You mean the shorts
that last a lifetime plus 1 0 years?
Yes. Yeah.

42:15.299 --> 42:17.927
That-That's it. I'll be set.

42:18.002 --> 42:22.234
We'd be set. I know
it's not Shakespeare, but it's a job.

42:22.306 --> 42:25.366
Yes. I'm-I'm real happy
that one of us could make it big.

42:25.442 --> 42:27.433
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

42:27.511 --> 42:30.241
I told him I wouldn't sign with him
unless he signed you too.

42:30.314 --> 42:32.646
He wants to hear you sing.

42:32.716 --> 42:35.378
Oh, no,Joe.
I can't let you do that.
It's too late. I already did it.

42:35.452 --> 42:39.115
No, I couldn't possibly
jeopardize your-
Jane.Jane.

42:39.189 --> 42:43.785
- We deserve a chance.
- Action speaks louder
than words, Sam.

42:43.861 --> 42:48.560
What kind of a life?
I mean, what about kids,
or what-

42:48.632 --> 42:51.601
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Attaboy.</i>

42:51.669 --> 42:54.399
Nobody knows what the future holds.

42:54.471 --> 42:56.939
I could be dead tomorrow,

42:58.442 --> 43:00.569
or we could live together
for the next 50 years.

43:02.179 --> 43:05.046
Take a chance.

43:08.619 --> 43:10.849
<i>[ Chattering ]</i>

43:12.256 --> 43:14.190
Oh,Joe.
Now, now, now.

43:14.258 --> 43:17.386
Joe, no. I can't.
I really can't.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

43:18.729 --> 43:22.290
No matter how you do,
I'll still love you.

43:30.307 --> 43:32.434
Okay.
Okay. Now, give 'em hell.

43:32.509 --> 43:34.500
All right.

Sam, you did it.
You did it.

44:55.626 --> 44:58.117
Jane and Joe sign
with Rosenfeld and Adams.

44:58.195 --> 45:00.129
And then in a week
they get married,

45:00.197 --> 45:04.600
and then Joe goes on
to make a fortune
selling underwear on TV.

45:04.668 --> 45:10.334
[ Chuckling ]
What aboutJane?
Well, she doesn't have much of a career.

45:10.407 --> 45:14.571
But, you know,
she does a couple of commercials.
Sings with a band every once in a while.

45:14.645 --> 45:17.910
And she's happy.
That's the thing, she's really happy.
