Clark, you only wanted
to see your mother.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.656
If anyone can understand that, it's me.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.067
There's no point in beating yourself up.

33:58.245 --> 34:00.076
Why not, Lana?

34:00.288 --> 34:02.370
People I care about got hurt.

34:02.541 --> 34:06.125
Jor-El was right. I shouldn't let emotions
get in the way of my common sense.

34:06.294 --> 34:10.628
You grew up on a planet of human beings,
it's okay to feel.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.040
Your emotions are a part of who you are.

34:13.218 --> 34:16.176
Yeah, they're more dangerous
than kryptonite.

34:16.638 --> 34:19.630
Clark, you got to meet your mother.

34:22.936 --> 34:26.178
Lana, I always thought
that if I ever did meet my mother...

34:26.356 --> 34:29.143
...she wouldn't live up to the idea
that I had of her.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.775
Well, she did.

34:34.156 --> 34:37.489
Clark, I will never be
as strong as your mother.

34:37.826 --> 34:42.160
And after everything I've done, I'm not sure
I am as good a person as you deserve.

34:43.874 --> 34:46.331
Lana, we all make mistakes.

34:47.377 --> 34:49.413
I'm living proof of that.

34:49.838 --> 34:53.046
It's how we come back from the mistakes,
that's what matters.

34:55.510 --> 34:59.970
How do you come back when you feel like
you're at the point of no return?

35:02.017 --> 35:05.350
Lana, look at everything you went through
to help my mother.

35:08.190 --> 35:10.306
You're not that far gone.

The fact-checkers
are gonna have a ﬁeld day with that one.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.595
You know, astronomers are saying
that it wasn't an actual eclipse.

35:49.773 --> 35:54.062
It was just some huge circular shadow
that was caused by water molecules.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.309
Not the astronomer I talked to.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.104
Trust me, Chlo,
I'm thinking two-inch-tall headline.

you picked this one to shift into slo-mo.

36:04.287 --> 36:07.745
Keep your pants on. I'm almost done.
I need a couple more milliseconds.

Why do I get the suspicion that you two
have had the Dear John conversation?

36:22.556 --> 36:23.921
Yes, we sure have.

36:24.099 --> 36:28.468
And let me tell you, those conversations
tend to quickly veer into awkward territory.

36:28.645 --> 36:31.102
You think he'd be man enough
to suck it up...

36:31.273 --> 36:33.764
...and treat you like everyone else.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.774

You're spying on me.
And it stops now.

I'm not a rat in one of your labs.

that you were dead...
