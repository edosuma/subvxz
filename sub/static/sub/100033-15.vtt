chugga-chugga-chugga-

00:07.355 --> 00:08.443
chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.575
Choo-choo!

00:10.619 --> 00:12.664
Carrots are awesome.
Daddy love carrots.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.623
All right, forget carrots.
Carrots are lame.

00:14.666 --> 00:17.495
The pear patrol.
♪ Do, do, do, do, do

00:17.539 --> 00:19.541
♪ Do, do, do

00:19.584 --> 00:21.543
You don't like the pear patrol?

00:21.586 --> 00:24.154
The banana boat, going for
a ride across the waves,

00:24.198 --> 00:27.505
coming in flying...
it's yummy, it's yummy.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.681
Please, please, please,
eat the banana boat.

00:29.725 --> 00:30.769
It's not happening.
It's not happening.

00:30.813 --> 00:33.598
We got the beets.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.383
Yeah, we're gonna
drop the beets.

00:35.426 --> 00:37.428
We're gonna drop the beets
right--

00:37.472 --> 00:39.387
right in there.
No?

00:39.430 --> 00:40.736
Oh, oh, okay.
You wanna take it?

00:40.779 --> 00:42.607
Look at you.
You gonna feed yourself?

01:02.410 --> 01:03.715
Oh--

01:07.937 --> 01:10.200
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:13.856 --> 01:16.250
So you know Evie's taken a job
in San Francisco.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.730
- I do.
- Yeah, and, um,

01:18.774 --> 01:21.864
seeing as we're, uh,
gonna get married soon--

01:21.907 --> 01:24.084
- Mm-hmm.
You're leaving.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.390
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:26.434 --> 01:30.220
Um, I really didn't have
a choice here, Max.

01:30.264 --> 01:31.787
I'll help you fill
the position, of course.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.876
You know,
sort through resumes.

01:33.919 --> 01:36.096
- Not necessary.
Congrats.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.491
- Tonight's the big night
isn't it--dinner with mom?

01:40.535 --> 01:42.276
- Oh, God, thank you
for the reminder.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.625
- You know why
she reached out to you?

01:43.668 --> 01:45.235
- Well, because she is sober
this week

01:45.279 --> 01:47.281
and wants to make amends
for the thousandth time.

01:47.324 --> 01:49.326
I'm only going
because I like the restaurant.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.590
Holland.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.810
- I know, I know.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.333
- I was really hoping

01:56.377 --> 01:58.466
I wouldn't see you
back here again.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.250
- Yeah.

02:00.294 --> 02:03.427
Now I have to send you home.

02:05.212 --> 02:08.171
I just misjudged the dose.
I'm not gonna OD again.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.434
- Can someone help us?
- On it.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.436
- I'm already taking less
than I was before,

02:12.480 --> 02:15.657
and I have a whole new plan.
- Okay, we talked about this.

02:15.700 --> 02:19.748
Addiction is not something
that you can tackle alone.

02:19.791 --> 02:22.446
You need support.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.579
Trust me.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.930
I know the dance all too well.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.631
Please.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.159
- Lauren?

02:43.946 --> 02:47.341
- Valentina?
Do you have a minute to chat?

02:47.384 --> 02:49.343
- Sure, I'm just late
for a meeting.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.649
- I saw Fatima Abassi
yesterday.

02:51.693 --> 02:54.217
Her eyes were glazed.
She mumbling to herself.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.524
I'm just curious if any other
patients in your trial

02:56.567 --> 02:58.830
had these symptoms.
- What are you suggesting?

02:58.874 --> 03:01.659
- Nothing.
I'm just concerned.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.879
When she was receiving
traditional chemotherapy--

03:03.922 --> 03:05.315
- She's no longer
your patient.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.665
- Understood.
But I care about her--

03:07.709 --> 03:10.581
- Under the guise of concern
you're implying that

03:10.625 --> 03:12.496
I'm withholding my drug's side
effects to protect my trial.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.281
Right?

03:14.324 --> 03:16.631
Stay in your lane.
I have a department to run.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.769
- Altered mental state.
Diaphoresis.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.858
I must say
your husband's symptoms

03:26.902 --> 03:27.990
are rather confounding,

03:28.033 --> 03:29.731
but they are not from stroke
or dementia.

03:29.774 --> 03:30.993
- Our tests have ruled out

03:31.036 --> 03:33.256
liver failure, diabetes,
and drug ingestion.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.346
- He's never taken a drug
in his life.

03:36.390 --> 03:39.523
- What about alcohol?
- Joe doesn't drink.

03:39.567 --> 03:40.829
- Are you certain?

03:40.872 --> 03:43.658
Sweating, delirium--
could be alcohol withdrawal.

03:43.701 --> 03:45.616
- Yes.
I'm certain.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.923
I've lived with the man
over 40 years.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.752
- Okay,
based on Joe's symptoms,

03:50.795 --> 03:53.363
I'd like to start him
on high-dose benzos.

03:53.407 --> 03:56.845
And when he recovers, perhaps
we will all know him better.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.502
- A sip?
- No thanks.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.895
I just added something
like that to my mulch pile.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.333
- Okay, well, you have no idea
what you're missing.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.291
- That's supposed to cure
your sugar cravings?

04:08.335 --> 04:09.901
- Yup, no more junk food
for me, Gladys.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.686
My body deserves better.
I deserve better.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.078
- Dr. Frome.
- Who's gonna tell that

04:13.122 --> 04:14.471
to the pastry landfill
in your desk?

04:14.515 --> 04:16.865
- You know, I'm sending in
a hazmat crew today

04:16.908 --> 04:18.040
if you must know.
- Mmm.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.781
Well, the cleanup
will have to wait.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.086
There's a cute couple
eager to see you.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.566
Dr. Steiner's referral.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.873
- Yes, the refreshing break
that is couples counseling.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.091
See?

04:26.135 --> 04:28.442
Healthy choices
are being rewarded Gladys.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.574
Take heed.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.447
Chris and Jenny, right?

04:33.490 --> 04:35.318
- Uh, yeah.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.972
Thanks for fitting us in.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.366
Dr. Steiner told us you were
one of his favorite students.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.933
- One of?

04:41.977 --> 04:44.414
Well, if that isn't a blow.
Jeez.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.678
And you two are both from
Long Island, as well, right?

04:47.722 --> 04:50.333
- Yeah, we both grew up there.
- Okeydoke.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.335
So what are we doing here
today?

04:53.684 --> 04:56.339
- Uh, Jenny and I have been
together for nine years,

04:56.383 --> 04:58.428
and we'd been planning on
getting married

04:58.472 --> 05:00.082
at the end of the month,

05:00.125 --> 05:02.432
but we've been having
some problems.

05:02.476 --> 05:06.001
- It happens.
- We're fighting, all the time.

05:07.132 --> 05:08.612
We haven't had sex
in over a month.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.092
We're not even living together
right now.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.616
Jenny moved in with a friend.
- I'm sorry--is this--

05:12.660 --> 05:14.966
is this seriously
what you're opening with?

05:15.010 --> 05:16.359
- Well, Jenny,

05:16.403 --> 05:18.709
what do you think
he should be opening with?

05:20.494 --> 05:22.757
- We, um, we got a--

05:22.800 --> 05:24.672
an early wedding present
from my uncle.

05:24.715 --> 05:27.152
It was a--a DNA kit.

05:27.196 --> 05:30.765
One of those things that tells
you how French you are,

05:30.808 --> 05:32.984
if you're related to George
Washington--you know.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.465
Um...
- Did you guys send it in?

05:37.946 --> 05:39.861
- We did.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.472
- And?

05:42.516 --> 05:43.995
- Well, we're not French.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.521
- We're brother and sister.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.874
- How can I help?
- Are you aware that your ED

05:52.917 --> 05:55.572
just discharged another patient
who overdosed on opiates?

05:55.616 --> 05:56.704
- No, but I'm not surprised.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.923
We're up to about
ten a day now.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.838
- Do you know how
much the opioid epidemic

06:00.882 --> 06:03.493
cost this country last year?
- $500 billion.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.539
- 700 billion.

06:05.582 --> 06:08.150
We've seen a massive increase
in patient overdoses,

06:08.193 --> 06:10.195
most of whom are
simply treated and released,

06:10.239 --> 06:12.154
only to return days later
if they're lucky.

06:12.197 --> 06:13.851
- And most of these
folks are uninsured,

06:13.895 --> 06:15.853
so we're operating at a loss.
Is that your issue?

06:15.897 --> 06:17.420
- It certainly is one of them.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.509
- Well, Karen, I assure you
that we spend a lot of time

06:19.553 --> 06:21.685
talking to our patients about
the dangers of opioids,

06:21.729 --> 06:24.079
but when you have massive
pharmaceutical companies

06:24.122 --> 06:25.689
delivering a very different
message--

06:25.733 --> 06:26.995
- I know what
they're delivering.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.518
- Then what have I done wrong?
- Nothing.

06:28.562 --> 06:29.824
Which is precisely the problem.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.521
- I thought you wanted me
to do nothing.

06:31.565 --> 06:32.783
- Not today.

06:32.827 --> 06:35.525
Today I want you to turn
this epidemic around.

06:35.569 --> 06:36.918
All the crazy ideas,

06:36.961 --> 06:39.703
all the impulsive, rash
tantrums you want to throw--

06:39.747 --> 06:41.705
throw them, break the law,
I don't care.

06:41.749 --> 06:44.752
You'll have my full,
unwavering support.

06:44.795 --> 06:48.233
- Is this, um--
Are there--are there cameras?

06:48.277 --> 06:49.844
- Max.

06:49.887 --> 06:52.020
I want to see
how much damage you can do.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.677
- Challenge accepted.

07:00.332 --> 07:04.032
- This is one dose, one pill,
of the opiate oxycodone.

07:04.075 --> 07:06.164
The pharmacy asked me
for a prescription,

07:06.208 --> 07:08.340
and seeing as how I was only
looking for a visual aid,

07:08.384 --> 07:10.212
I didn't have one.

07:10.255 --> 07:13.215
So I had to drag our chairwoman
here to the dispensary

07:13.258 --> 07:15.435
where we each
had to sign wavers

07:15.478 --> 07:18.220
affirming our
educational intent.

07:18.263 --> 07:21.441
But if I sold you this pill,
or even just gave it to you,

07:21.484 --> 07:23.312
it's a loss of medical license
for me

07:23.355 --> 07:26.184
and actual jail time for her.

07:27.403 --> 07:28.970
1%.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.059
That's how many doctors at New
Amsterdam are in this room.

07:31.102 --> 07:35.019
Yet, you prescribe 79%
of the opioids here.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.369
And given that we are hooking
patients by the thousands

07:37.413 --> 07:40.416
on drugs that are a molecule
away from black tar heroin,

07:40.460 --> 07:43.071
can anyone tell me why you all
shouldn't be arrested?

07:46.248 --> 07:48.468
- You know they have
a legitimate use.

07:48.511 --> 07:50.078
- Not at the levels
you're prescribing them.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.471
- None of us
prescribe them lightly.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.255
Standards of care suggest
they're the best choice

07:53.298 --> 07:54.952
for our patients.
- Not true.

07:54.996 --> 07:57.259
The SOC says they're
the most efficient choice,

07:57.302 --> 07:58.521
and if you're looking
to drop a few pounds

07:58.565 --> 08:00.741
amputation
is pretty efficient too.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.351
- Our patients want them,
Max.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.092
They ask for them
by brand name.

08:04.135 --> 08:05.572
- They also do that
with cigarettes.

08:05.615 --> 08:08.444
- And our funding is tied to
patient satisfaction scores.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.012
- Well, it's kind of hard
to be satisfied if you're dead.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.753
- Max.
- Nope, this changes now.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.319
All right?
Since you all prescribe

08:14.363 --> 08:16.365
79% of our opioids,

08:16.408 --> 08:20.717
I'm giving you one year
to prescribe 79% less,

08:20.761 --> 08:24.634
and anyone who does not meet
that mark will be fired.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.555
Thank you for coming.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.476
You may get some calls.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.391
- This is war, Max.

08:42.434 --> 08:45.220
And your solution
is to berate our staff?

08:45.263 --> 08:48.310
- Yeah--and threaten.
- Hell, I could've done that.

08:48.353 --> 08:51.487
I want a macro solution.
I want the full Max.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.751
But that down there--
very disappointing.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.451
- What's wrong?
- No pulse.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.497
- V-fib.
All clear.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.370
- Still not there.
- Going again.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.198
All clear.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.594
- He's back.
- Thank God.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.339
- Vijay.
- ST segment elevations.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.297
- Active ischemia.
I'll page Reynolds.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.566
- I'm afraid
I owe you an apology.

09:26.609 --> 09:29.786
Your husband is not going
through alcohol withdrawal.

09:29.830 --> 09:33.050
He had a heart attack.
- Before he got here?

09:33.094 --> 09:34.312
- No, just now.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.227
Which speaks to
an underlying condition.

09:36.271 --> 09:38.186
- Meaning?

09:38.229 --> 09:40.144
- We have
a far greater problem.

09:42.843 --> 09:45.802
- Approaching the right
coronary artery.

09:45.846 --> 09:48.370
You see that narrowing?
- Proximal section?

09:48.413 --> 09:51.068
- Yes, that blockage
is causing his ischemia.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.504
So I'm just gonna put
a stent in there,

09:52.548 --> 09:55.464
open up the artery,
and he should be good to go.

09:55.507 --> 09:56.900
- What's that?

09:56.944 --> 09:59.686
In the left anterior.
It also looks like a narrowing.

09:59.729 --> 10:03.080
- That's weird.
That wasn't there a second ago.

10:03.124 --> 10:06.736
Okay, Lana,
placing a second stent.

10:06.780 --> 10:10.784
- Floyd, another area's
constricting in the circumflex.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.524
- The hell is going on?

10:12.568 --> 10:15.527
Every time I open up an artery,
another one closes.

10:15.571 --> 10:18.530
- And if you stop?

10:18.574 --> 10:20.794
- He'll die.

10:22.752 --> 10:25.494
- So, you're situation,
to put it mildly,

10:25.537 --> 10:28.105
is a little more complicated
than most.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.630
You are half-siblings.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.286
All right, what about, um,

10:35.330 --> 10:36.592
let's start with
a little context.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.768
How did you two meet?

10:38.812 --> 10:42.337
- It was the second day
of freshmen year at NYU.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.600
I was in a philosophy class.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.906
Which I almost
immediately realized

10:45.949 --> 10:47.690
was the worst decision
I'd ever made...

10:49.823 --> 10:51.651
Until Jenny walked in.

10:53.261 --> 10:56.394
She was 20 minutes late, and
when the professor apologized

10:56.438 --> 11:00.398
for having such an early class,
she just said, "No problem."

11:04.664 --> 11:06.448
Then she sat down next to me.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.711
- How long before you two
went out?

11:08.755 --> 11:12.149
- We got coffee
after class.

11:12.193 --> 11:15.849
But immediately I knew
we were meant to be together.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.460
Even before we both learned
we were from Port Jeff.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.592
- Port Jefferson,
that's a population of--

11:20.636 --> 11:23.247
- 8,000.
Pretty small.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.379
- Especially
if both your mothers

11:24.422 --> 11:25.815
used anonymous sperm donors.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.512
- Right.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.603
Have you told your parents?
- No.

11:31.647 --> 11:34.258
No, we haven't told anyone.
We're not going to tell anyone.

11:34.302 --> 11:37.218
- Well, they are expecting us
to get married in 16 days.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.220
- Right.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.787
Well, let me ask you this.

11:40.830 --> 11:44.399
What are you both hoping
to get out of this session?

11:44.442 --> 11:46.270
- You know, processing this.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.490
Finding our way back
to each other.

11:48.533 --> 11:52.407
- God, Chris, there's
no finding our way back.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.757
We are--we're related.

11:57.542 --> 12:01.329
- Well, Chris, why do you
think this can be fixed?

12:02.983 --> 12:05.637
Because the day I met Jenny
was the best day of my life...

12:07.727 --> 12:09.859
And every day since
has been better.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.602
Look, I know that this
is insane, okay?

12:13.645 --> 12:15.169
Believe me.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.736
And I can understand why you
can't see a way through it,

12:16.779 --> 12:20.565
but I can't imagine
not going back to how we were.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.611
Not coming home to you--

12:26.702 --> 12:28.965
If you think it's impossible,

12:29.009 --> 12:30.575
and you can look me in the eye
and tell me right now

12:30.619 --> 12:31.794
that you don't love me
anymore,

12:31.838 --> 12:33.753
then I will call off
the wedding.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.936
- You know I love you...

12:45.808 --> 12:47.679
But love just isn't enough.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.727
It isn't enough, is it?

12:55.035 --> 12:58.429
- Hi, so, uh, I'm here
to end the opioid epidemic.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.736
- Okay.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.651
- So half the ODs occur

13:02.694 --> 13:04.871
within three months of a visit
to the emergency room,

13:04.914 --> 13:06.568
but if we prescribe suboxone--

13:06.611 --> 13:08.788
- We could manage the symptoms
of opioid withdrawal

13:08.831 --> 13:10.833
without the risk of fatality.
- Exactly.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.009
- We'll need a Treatment Act
Waiver by the DEA,

13:13.053 --> 13:15.316
and even then, each licensed
doctor's only allowed

13:15.359 --> 13:17.622
to treat 30 patients at a time.
- So who's all licensed?

13:17.666 --> 13:19.015
- You're looking at her.
- Really?

13:19.059 --> 13:21.757
Well, that has to change.
Today.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.106
- To get everyone licensed,

13:23.150 --> 13:24.455
they'll need to go on
an all-day training course.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.414
- Sure, okay, grab all
the doctors, attendings,

13:26.457 --> 13:27.937
and residents and have them
take that test,

13:27.981 --> 13:29.852
and nobody comes back
until they pass.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.593
- That would mean
shutting down ED.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.421
- Yeah, so shut it down.

13:33.464 --> 13:34.944
- No, Max.
- Yes.

13:34.988 --> 13:36.903
- You want me to call the
department of public health,

13:36.946 --> 13:38.600
re-route all ambulances,

13:38.643 --> 13:39.862
suspend our Level I
Trauma status,

13:39.906 --> 13:41.864
and potentially move
a multitude of patients

13:41.908 --> 13:43.387
who are already being treated?

13:43.431 --> 13:44.867
- That's a great plan.
- Max!

13:44.911 --> 13:46.913
That's unheard of.
It would make the news!

13:46.956 --> 13:49.872
And Brantley--
- Will love it! Go!

13:54.877 --> 13:56.879
- A secret rendezvous
on the pier?

13:56.923 --> 13:59.316
Are we catching up or
practicing our spy craft?

13:59.360 --> 14:00.709
- Audra.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.886
I'm sorry for all
the cloak and dagger,

14:03.930 --> 14:07.542
but I have a dilemma,
and I'm afraid it is a secret.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.674
- What's up?
- Um...

14:11.981 --> 14:14.897
- It involves the NIH trial
that Castro's running

14:14.941 --> 14:16.246
out of New Amsterdam.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.858
- What's your dilemma?
- I'm not entirely sure.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.816
Not yet.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.558
- Are you concerned there's
been a protocol deviation?

14:23.601 --> 14:24.951
Because that could jeopardize

14:24.994 --> 14:27.344
all NIH funding
at your hospital.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.738
We're talking hundreds
of millions of dollars.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.828
- Which is why I needed to
speak with you off the record

14:32.872 --> 14:34.656
without your NIH hat on.

14:34.699 --> 14:37.093
I don't have a lot of details.

14:37.137 --> 14:40.836
I'm simply trying to help one
of my patients that's involved.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.926
Have you heard of any
significant side effects

14:43.970 --> 14:46.102
from Castro's trial?

14:46.146 --> 14:48.148
- She hasn't reported anything,

14:48.191 --> 14:49.845
but she's supposed to document

14:49.889 --> 14:51.629
any adverse reactions
immediately.

14:51.673 --> 14:54.458
Is your patient on
the protocol or the placebo?

14:54.502 --> 14:56.504
- I don't know.
- Well, you have to find out.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.071
It's the only way to verify.

14:58.114 --> 15:01.944
- But that would mean
violating the double-blind.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.772
- You can Castro directly.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.645
Yeah, that would be,
um--awkward.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.734
- Then go around her
if you have to.

15:11.606 --> 15:12.868
You need to know
if the patient

15:12.912 --> 15:14.696
is on the placebo
or the drug.

15:14.739 --> 15:16.393
And if it's the drug--

15:16.437 --> 15:18.395
- We have a bigger
conversation.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.445
- Uh, not sure if you've heard,

15:24.488 --> 15:27.448
but both NPR and New York One
are buzzing about us.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.058
- Because you shuttered the ED?
- That's right.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.887
Both lead stories, both focused
on the opioid epidemic.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.020
You know, we're gonna have
more licensed suboxone doctors

15:34.063 --> 15:36.022
in this hospital than any other
hospital in the country.

15:36.065 --> 15:37.849
- Wonderful.
You want a cookie?

15:37.893 --> 15:38.938
- What?

15:38.981 --> 15:40.417
- I didn't ask you
to raise awareness,

15:40.461 --> 15:41.766
I asked you
to solve the problem.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.943
But instead
you're handing out detox drugs

15:43.986 --> 15:45.118
while millions of people

15:45.161 --> 15:46.467
outside the hospital
are suffering.

15:46.510 --> 15:47.598
- I don't work outside
the hospital.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.035
- Yes, you do.
When you want to.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.906
Blood pressure testing
in barber shops?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.126
Chasing down insurance agents
in their offices?

15:53.169 --> 15:56.172
Come on, Max!
It's me you're talking to.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.917
People are dying.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.053
Do better.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.281
- Casey, Casey.
Get him situated in Urology.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.979
Don't let them pawn him off.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.939
- Incoming!

16:23.983 --> 16:26.115
- Carolyn Werner, 20,
fell in Times Square.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.551
Looks like
a radial/ulna fracture.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.162
BP 120 over--
- Okay, let me stop you

16:29.205 --> 16:31.947
right there--she is stable with
an isolated injury to the arm?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.209
- Yeah.
- Turn her around

16:33.253 --> 16:34.950
and take her to Baptist.
- Are you serious?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.952
- Uh, we thought dispatch
was mistaken.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.694
- No.
We are closed.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.567
- What the hell am I supposed
to do with all these?

16:43.611 --> 16:45.743
I don't know, Dr. Skein.

16:45.787 --> 16:49.573
They are patients admitted to
your care, so...tend to them?

16:49.617 --> 16:51.227
- 20 people?

16:51.271 --> 16:53.360
You've clogged every bed in my
department with this--this--

16:53.403 --> 16:54.622
uh, whatever you're doing.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.450
- We are trying to solve
the opioid crisis.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.408
A crisis you helped cause.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.976
- I'm a dermatologist.

17:02.673 --> 17:07.417
- I will admit that your
situation is difficult.

17:07.461 --> 17:10.507
Um, but is not my job to judge

17:10.551 --> 17:13.249
whether your relationship
is right or wrong.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.034
What is very apparent to me

17:15.077 --> 17:17.645
is the love between you two
is very real.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.736
And if you want,
worth fighting for.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.437
There is one
inconvertible truth.

17:27.481 --> 17:30.571
Biological children
can never be an option.

17:30.614 --> 17:33.095
- You think kids are what
we're worried about?

17:33.139 --> 17:35.097
I can't even look at him.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.099
- Because this new information

17:37.143 --> 17:39.275
has changed the way
you see him?

17:39.319 --> 17:42.191
Well, good news there.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.106
Relationships
can survive change.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.456
In fact, almost all of them
have to.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.024
- This isn't like he's suddenly
gained 20 pounds.

17:50.156 --> 17:53.681
- No, um--
Look, I get it.

17:53.724 --> 17:57.032
But life goes on,
and you adjust.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.296
Relationships adjust too,
or they end.

18:02.690 --> 18:05.823
If change is insurmountable
in the heart, then that's it,

18:05.867 --> 18:07.173
show's over.

18:07.216 --> 18:10.045
But that is not
the case with you two.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.351
Is it?

18:11.394 --> 18:14.049
So the real question becomes:

18:14.093 --> 18:16.182
can we change
what's in your heads?

18:18.706 --> 18:20.229
- How?

18:21.839 --> 18:25.495
- Jenny, will you sit
on the couch with Chris?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.391
- Good.

18:51.434 --> 18:54.437
Jenny, will you take
Chris's hand?

19:04.230 --> 19:05.579
Jenny.

19:07.276 --> 19:08.843
- I can't.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.453
I can't.
I can't.

19:10.497 --> 19:13.239
I'm sorry.

19:19.288 --> 19:20.898
- Floyd.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.378
His test level shows

19:22.422 --> 19:24.337
extremely high levels
of creatinine kinase.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.426
It's already damaged
his kidneys.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.167
- That means his muscles
are breaking down.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.517
- Vasospasm, delirium,
muscle breakdown--

19:30.560 --> 19:33.433
it all adds up to one thing:
decompression sickness.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.739
- The bends?

19:35.783 --> 19:39.221
- Joe has never gone
scuba diving in his life.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.571
I tried to get him to go
on our honeymoon,

19:41.615 --> 19:43.094
but he's afraid
of the water.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.749
- That may be true, but
I'm certain of this diagnosis.

19:45.793 --> 19:48.535
- You were certain before,
but you were wrong.

19:48.578 --> 19:51.146
Joe doesn't drink,
and he's not a water guy.

19:51.190 --> 19:55.716
Even on vacation, he is a good,
decent, no nonsense,

19:55.759 --> 19:58.501
stay-in-the-room-and-watch-golf
guy.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.242
- But with
the symptoms exhibiting,

20:00.286 --> 20:02.766
if we do not put him in
hyperbaric chamber right away,

20:02.810 --> 20:05.769
I'm afraid he will be
a dead guy.

20:05.813 --> 20:07.597
- Who knows him better,
Dr. Kapoor?

20:07.641 --> 20:09.469
His wife of 40 years or you?

20:17.477 --> 20:19.566
- Hi, I'm looking
for Dr. Castro.

20:19.609 --> 20:22.264
- She'll be back
in about 15 minutes.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.918
- Perfect.

21:01.434 --> 21:03.436
- Satisfied?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.789
I've tried to be
the bigger person here.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.051
- Valentina--

21:10.094 --> 21:11.922
- If you focused a bit more
on the patient

21:11.966 --> 21:14.403
instead of trying to nail me
to the wall,

21:14.447 --> 21:17.537
you might have noticed that
Fatima has aggressive arthritis

21:17.580 --> 21:18.929
in her left wrist.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.323
It was caused by
an enterobacter infection

21:21.367 --> 21:23.760
which then relisted
as a thiamine deficiency.

21:23.804 --> 21:25.762
That's what led
to her delirium.

21:25.806 --> 21:30.245
Not my drug.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.333
You're welcome.

21:37.861 --> 21:41.343
- Dr. Morris, I apologize that
your hospital is overflowing,

21:41.387 --> 21:43.693
but I will see you very soon,
okay?

21:43.737 --> 21:45.478
Uh, Max Goodwin.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.524
Dr. Farnum, yes,
I, um, did close the ED

21:48.568 --> 21:50.831
and I look forward
to explaining why shortly.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.354
Max Goodwin.
- Hi.

21:52.398 --> 21:53.573
- Alice.

21:53.616 --> 21:54.965
- I'm sorry to bother you
at work.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.271
Did you get my text?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.012
- Yeah, no--I did,
I've been, um--

21:58.055 --> 22:00.362
- I know you're busy,
but are you free tonight?

22:00.406 --> 22:01.537
- Tonight?

22:01.581 --> 22:03.800
Uh.
Tonight, tonight?

22:03.844 --> 22:07.021
- I got this gig,
and I can't find a sitter.

22:07.064 --> 22:09.328
I hate asking.
I feel terrible.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.981
- Oh, right.
No, of course.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.418
Yes, I can.
Yes.

22:12.461 --> 22:15.421
I thought--great.
Yeah, Luna's gonna love that.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.379
- Thank you so much.
- Sure, sure.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.946
Happy to help.
- See you tonight.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.401
Everybody told me
that it would be impossible

22:39.445 --> 22:41.403
to get the city's top
medical directors

22:41.447 --> 22:43.927
together in one room,
but then I reminded them

22:43.971 --> 22:47.453
how much medical directors
enjoy a free lunch.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.501
Yeah, so, um...

22:52.545 --> 22:55.635
earlier today, I put
New Amsterdam on diversion.

22:55.678 --> 22:57.767
I know that closing our ED

22:57.811 --> 23:01.031
caused problems
for many of you.

23:01.075 --> 23:02.772
To those of you
who are still annoyed,

23:02.816 --> 23:06.907
I just want to say
it's about to get worse.

23:06.950 --> 23:12.434
This is how much money New
Amsterdam spends on opioids

23:12.478 --> 23:15.568
every year, and every hospital
network in the city

23:15.611 --> 23:17.787
is spending the same.
Just the 15 of us,

23:17.831 --> 23:19.789
sitting here in this room

23:19.833 --> 23:22.923
are spending $1 billion a year

23:22.966 --> 23:25.795
on a product that we know
is killing people.

23:25.839 --> 23:29.669
We're hospitals.
Killing people should be

23:29.712 --> 23:33.020
pretty high on the list
of things we try not to do.

23:33.063 --> 23:35.936
- Opioids work
incredibly well.

23:35.979 --> 23:37.459
- That's right, Florence.
They do work.

23:37.503 --> 23:40.593
But they also worked in 1996,
and back then they worked

23:40.636 --> 23:43.117
without causing an
international addiction crisis.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.640
That was before the Nylers

23:44.684 --> 23:47.121
started launching
propaganda campaigns

23:47.164 --> 23:50.037
and buying off hospitals--
- Including yours.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.040
- That's right.
Including mine.

23:53.083 --> 23:56.478
Raise your hand if your
hospital has a Nyler Wing.

23:56.522 --> 23:59.002
I'm not saying
that New Amsterdam

23:59.046 --> 24:00.482
is better than anyone else.

24:00.526 --> 24:04.660
I am saying it's time
to return to ethical behavior.

24:04.704 --> 24:08.577
So instead of giving the Nylers

24:08.621 --> 24:10.492
another billion dollars
this year,

24:10.536 --> 24:14.931
I'd like to propose
a new number.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.847
I'm ready to cancel New
Amsterdam's opioid contract

24:17.891 --> 24:19.632
right now,

24:19.675 --> 24:22.678
and I want you all
to do the same.

24:22.722 --> 24:26.900
We have to hit them hard,
we have to hit them together,

24:26.943 --> 24:29.642
and what we need is unity.

24:29.685 --> 24:32.471
- Unity
is an anti-trust violation.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.908
- There is blood

24:34.951 --> 24:37.867
on all of our hands.

24:37.911 --> 24:40.043
I think it's time
to wash it off.

24:42.089 --> 24:43.656
So who's with me?

24:51.794 --> 24:54.623
Florence?
- Pass.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.756
- We could change things.
Dr. Farnum!

25:01.108 --> 25:02.501
John.

25:15.383 --> 25:18.038
- Yes, well, can you--
can you expedite it?

25:18.081 --> 25:19.387
Yeah, I mean is there a fee
that I can pay for a faster--

25:19.430 --> 25:22.477
Mm-hmm.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.913
Okay, well call me back.

25:23.957 --> 25:25.088
Yep.
Thank you.

25:25.132 --> 25:27.569
Our pacemaker supplier
can't make shipment.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.484
No big deal,
they're just people's hearts.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.138
Stents are being held up too.

25:31.181 --> 25:33.619
- Not to pile on,
but several of my chemo drugs

25:33.662 --> 25:36.056
won't be coming in tomorrow.
Or ever.

25:37.448 --> 25:38.667
- It's the Nylers.
They're retaliating

25:38.711 --> 25:41.104
because I ripped up
their opioid contract.

25:41.148 --> 25:43.324
- Their companies make more
than just opioids, Max.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.065
Most of my drugs
are under their patent.

25:45.108 --> 25:46.675
No one besides Nyler
can make them.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.982
Look, I love that we're finally
taking a stand against them,

25:49.025 --> 25:51.419
but this could jeopardize
the lives of our patients.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.117
- Can someone please tell me

25:54.161 --> 25:58.034
why my supplier just killed
my order for acne cream?

26:02.430 --> 26:03.649
- His wife said he's afraid
of the water.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.389
- I know.

26:05.433 --> 26:07.304
- What if he has an endocrine
disorder or something?

26:07.348 --> 26:10.656
I mean, isn't your whole thing
about listening to the patient?

26:10.699 --> 26:12.658
- I am listening.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.485
To Joe.

26:14.529 --> 26:17.140
Despite everything
his wife believes,

26:17.184 --> 26:21.014
his body's saying
decompression sickness.

26:26.759 --> 26:29.762
- You better hope you're right.

26:29.805 --> 26:32.155
- Jenny, this is your DNA,

26:32.199 --> 26:34.636
and Christopher,
this is your DNA.

26:36.116 --> 26:37.596
- They're the same.
- Not quite.

26:37.639 --> 26:40.337
There's a .1% variant
between the two of you,

26:40.381 --> 26:43.079
but yes,
they are 98.5% identical.

26:44.472 --> 26:46.256
- What more do we need?

26:46.300 --> 26:49.346
- But this is my DNA.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.481
Also 98.5% identical
to both of yours.

26:53.524 --> 26:56.702
Because that
is the genetic similarity

26:56.745 --> 26:59.748
between any two human beings.

26:59.792 --> 27:03.578
Scientifically speaking,
we are all very much the same.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.016
- Jenny...

27:08.714 --> 27:12.631
- What?
I should carry a DNA chart

27:12.674 --> 27:14.371
to the market
to explain to everybody

27:14.415 --> 27:16.678
why it's okay
I'm married to my brother?

27:16.722 --> 27:19.159
- Why do you feel the need
to explain anything to anyone?

27:19.202 --> 27:21.640
- Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but there's just--

27:21.683 --> 27:22.945
there's nothing
that you're gonna say

27:22.989 --> 27:25.556
that's gonna make me forget
who Chris really is.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.820
- Okay.

27:27.863 --> 27:30.039
Okay, fair enough.

27:34.087 --> 27:36.698
Is there anything
that you could say?

27:41.181 --> 27:44.532
You were planning on
being married in 16 days.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.403
You must've written your vows.

28:02.202 --> 28:03.682
Okay.
Good.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.430
Chris.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.217
"As I sit here in our
half-painted living room

28:17.260 --> 28:21.525
"that you promised to finish,
listening to the, um,

28:21.569 --> 28:23.397
"Spin Doctors Album
that we bought for $1.00

28:23.440 --> 28:26.182
"at a yard sale because
the lady who sold it to us

28:26.226 --> 28:27.575
had no idea who they were..."

28:29.708 --> 28:31.710
"I can't believe
how happy I am

28:31.753 --> 28:33.537
or how lucky I am..."

28:38.455 --> 28:40.327
"I never thought
I would find somebody--

28:40.370 --> 28:45.114
"Somebody who laughs
at all my stupid duck jokes.

28:45.158 --> 28:48.465
"Or likes my grandma's
baked spaghetti.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.772
Or picks up all of our
bath towels all the time."

28:53.906 --> 28:57.561
"So of course I said yes
when you asked me to marry you.

28:59.607 --> 29:02.741
"Nobody's ever
loved me like you,

29:02.784 --> 29:04.786
and I've never wanted
to be with anybody..."

29:09.965 --> 29:11.793
- Okay.
Good.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.752
Jenny.

29:16.319 --> 29:18.191
Can you see that Chris?

29:25.851 --> 29:27.722
- The Chris you wrote
those vows for.

29:33.684 --> 29:36.339
- That is the only Chris
there is.

29:38.515 --> 29:39.778
And if you ever forget that,

29:39.821 --> 29:41.388
all you need to do is go back
to those vows.

29:41.431 --> 29:42.868
Just like every other couple.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.863
- Feeling pretty whooped,
huh?

30:23.778 --> 30:26.520
- The Nylers took you good.

30:26.563 --> 30:29.305
- That they did.

30:30.611 --> 30:32.265
Do you have their new contract?

30:36.312 --> 30:38.749
You know,
I don't know what's worse.

30:38.793 --> 30:40.403
People addicted to their drugs,

30:40.447 --> 30:42.536
or the system addicted
to their money.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.285
- Celeste.

30:52.328 --> 30:55.505
My little sister.
- Hmm.

30:55.549 --> 31:01.685
- She had this stupid surgery,
gum grafts of all things,

31:01.729 --> 31:05.385
but it hurt a lot,
so they gave her Oxy.

31:11.391 --> 31:12.914
She's gone now.

31:14.655 --> 31:16.352
Two years.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.445
- May I?

31:52.649 --> 31:54.782
- Hey, we're closed.

31:54.825 --> 31:57.654
- I know, just taking an OD
down to the morgue.

32:07.142 --> 32:08.970
- Oh, no.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.493
- You knew her?

32:50.185 --> 32:52.448
- It's a funny thing, you know,

32:52.492 --> 32:57.976
when you don't know anything.
I mean, I knew I was with you.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.500
I just couldn't get
the words out.

33:00.543 --> 33:03.024
- It's okay, honey.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.984
I'm just grateful
that you're all right.

33:07.028 --> 33:10.075
- Now, your wife said you'd
never been scuba diving before,

33:10.118 --> 33:11.293
but...

33:11.337 --> 33:13.121
- Since our
anniversary's coming up,

33:13.165 --> 33:16.255
I wanted to surprise you
by taking a few lessons.

33:16.298 --> 33:18.300
You wanted to go
on our honeymoon,

33:18.344 --> 33:19.867
but I was too scared.

33:19.910 --> 33:21.477
I wanted to show you
I could do it.

33:21.521 --> 33:24.002
- But you're not a water guy.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.961
Which is why I knew
it would be a surprise.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.095
- I didn't think
you could ever surprise me.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.187
- But you did.

33:41.062 --> 33:44.022
- So adorable.
- Mmm.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.501
Aren't they?
- Mmm.

33:45.545 --> 33:48.504
"Spiritualized"

34:04.346 --> 34:06.522
You don't own me.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.182
Mmm.

34:48.782 --> 34:51.132
- Oh.

34:55.223 --> 34:57.138
I wasn't sure
if you were gonna come.

34:59.053 --> 35:01.055
I mean, not that I blame you.

35:02.622 --> 35:05.973
I'm sober now.
- I don't wanna hear it, Mom.

35:07.279 --> 35:09.281
You wanna know
my earliest memory?

35:10.586 --> 35:13.415
Was Dad's friend
calling you an alcoholic.

35:14.634 --> 35:18.507
But Dad said no you weren't.
No, you were a drunk.

35:18.551 --> 35:22.207
After that, I did everything
I could to slow you down.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.688
The first time I got wasted,
I was seven.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.342
- ♪ There's a lot of things
that need to be done ♪

35:27.386 --> 35:28.691
- I chugged half your martini

35:28.735 --> 35:32.434
thinking the more I drank,
the less you could.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.001
You know what you did?

35:34.044 --> 35:37.004
You licked the glass,
and you made yourself another.

35:37.047 --> 35:39.311
That night you shouted at me,
not for being drunk--

35:39.354 --> 35:40.616
for being sick on the rug.

35:40.660 --> 35:41.748
- ♪ Lord, I have
a broken dream ♪

35:41.791 --> 35:44.490
- Lauren--
- No, I am not done, Mom.

35:44.533 --> 35:48.450
I have spent years
being angry at you.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.626
Hating you.

35:50.670 --> 35:53.194
Feeling sorry for you.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.761
Then doing it all over again.

35:54.804 --> 35:56.632
- ♪ There's a lot of things

35:56.676 --> 35:59.592
- And I don't know
when it happened,

35:59.635 --> 36:02.160
but I can't really feel
anything for you anymore.

36:02.203 --> 36:05.598
- ♪ Lord, I have

36:05.641 --> 36:08.427

36:10.211 --> 36:12.126

who was killing herself

36:16.261 --> 36:20.221
and you were an adult,
and you did not even try.

36:20.265 --> 36:23.093
So I am sad
because I got cheated.

36:24.530 --> 36:26.401
And it sucks.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.751
It really sucks,

so I can go.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.415
- I wish I could.

36:40.459 --> 36:42.852
I want to.

36:42.896 --> 36:45.203
I am sorry.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.380

Yo, you got a sec?

37:14.362 --> 37:16.712
Look, I don't feel good about
our conversation this morning.

37:16.756 --> 37:18.497
- Okay.
- No, it's not okay.

37:18.540 --> 37:21.239
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner,

37:21.282 --> 37:23.371
but you're just
gonna ice me now?

37:23.415 --> 37:25.460
My fiancée moved
to San Francisco.

37:25.504 --> 37:26.635
It's either her
or this hospital.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.333
- Look, Floyd.

37:29.464 --> 37:34.295
I just can't lose
anyone else this year.

38:30.003 --> 38:32.701
Dr. Brighton.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.703
- Did you ask people
to do this?

38:38.228 --> 38:40.230
- No.
- Mmm.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.364
Everyone's talking about

38:43.408 --> 38:45.584
how the Nylers
retaliated against you

38:45.627 --> 38:47.194
and against your hospital.

38:47.237 --> 38:48.369
By shutting you out,

38:48.413 --> 38:50.806
this company put patients'
lives at risk,

38:50.850 --> 38:53.331
and that's not business,
it's a shakedown.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.898
A shakedown that could happen
to any of us.

38:55.942 --> 38:58.205
- So what do you propose?

38:58.248 --> 39:00.294
- Unity.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.304
- This should counter
the infection, Fatima.

39:54.348 --> 39:55.871
Alleviate all your symptoms.

39:55.915 --> 39:58.526
- Thank you for figuring out
what was wrong.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.267
- Mmm.

40:00.310 --> 40:03.009
It wasn't me.
Dr. Castro made the diagnosis.

40:04.532 --> 40:07.405
You're very fortunate
to be in her trial.

40:07.448 --> 40:08.884
Hmm.

40:08.928 --> 40:11.757
- Okay.

40:19.808 --> 40:21.506
Lauren, call me
as soon as you can.

40:21.549 --> 40:23.508
I was wrong about
the side effects

40:23.551 --> 40:25.945
Castro's drug might be causing,
but I was right about her.

40:25.988 --> 40:28.513
She altered her patients'
numbers before treatment

40:28.556 --> 40:30.471
so their tumors
would look worse

40:30.515 --> 40:32.386
so her drug will appear to be
performing better

40:32.430 --> 40:35.345
than it actually is!
Castro altered her trial.

40:42.831 --> 40:44.442
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:44.485 --> 40:47.357
Wow, you look serious.

40:47.401 --> 40:49.490
- Yikes.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.318
That's not exactly
what I was going for.

40:51.361 --> 40:54.756
- No, no, I meant--
I just meant you look great.

40:56.976 --> 40:58.456
Uh, come on in.

41:01.502 --> 41:02.590
Hey, how'd it go?

41:02.634 --> 41:04.810
- Really well, yeah.
- Good.

41:04.853 --> 41:07.377
- Thanks for asking.
- Hey, yeah, sure.

41:07.421 --> 41:09.771
- How're the babies?
- They're exhausting.

41:09.815 --> 41:12.034
Adorable.
- Sleeping?

41:12.078 --> 41:15.124
- Yes, sleeping.
She, uh,

41:15.168 --> 41:16.909
jammed on this bad boy
quite a bit.

41:18.911 --> 41:20.869
She loves this.
- Yeah.

41:25.570 --> 41:28.442
- You--you have a...
- Oh.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.748
- A sweet potato?
- Oh.

41:29.791 --> 41:32.098
I think yam actually.

41:32.141 --> 41:33.969
- It's a good look for you.

41:34.013 --> 41:36.537
- Yeah, it's kind of
becoming my go to.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.539
- There's more.

41:39.888 --> 41:41.107
Here.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.505
- Thanks.
