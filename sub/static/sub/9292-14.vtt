00:13.034 --> 00:14.401
Have you got it yet?

00:14.468 --> 00:16.434
Told you I'd call you
as soon as I have everything.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.034
I'm paying you a lot of money,
Collette.

00:19.101 --> 00:20.667
And if you could've gotten

00:20.734 --> 00:22.800
the detailed specs of a facility
this secure

00:22.867 --> 00:24.734
from someone else, you would've.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.734
CTU is no longer
an obstacle.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.167
MAN:
This facility
has been contaminated

00:29.234 --> 00:31.567
with Sentox VX1 nerve gas.

00:31.633 --> 00:34.767
Repeat: this facility
has been contaminated.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.468
Everybody, leave
the situation room.
Move! Now!

00:36.533 --> 00:38.001
Seal it.

00:38.067 --> 00:39.567
Lynn, it's Jack.

00:39.633 --> 00:41.167
We found a computer interrupt

00:41.234 --> 00:42.734
in the AC control unit.
Now if we can

00:42.800 --> 00:45.101
shut that down in the next few
minutes, we can stop the gas

00:45.167 --> 00:46.633
from permeating the safe zones.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.001
The problem is
you're the only person

00:48.067 --> 00:49.234
close enough to get to it.

00:49.301 --> 00:51.234
Lynn, the truth is
if I could get there,

00:51.301 --> 00:53.934
I would do this myself,
but I'm not close enough.

00:54.001 --> 00:56.234
And I'm going to have
to ask you to do it

00:56.301 --> 00:57.401
without any protection.

01:00.934 --> 01:02.067
He did it.

01:04.367 --> 01:05.367
Oh, my God.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.667
( groans )

01:08.734 --> 01:10.734
CTU is protecting
this city.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.167
Are you saying
they're no longer

01:12.234 --> 01:13.567
capable of doing that?

01:13.633 --> 01:15.201
I'm saying they've been
seriously compromised here.

01:15.267 --> 01:18.001
We've got terrorists with nerve
gas canisters out there.

01:18.067 --> 01:19.967
Who is going to stop them?

01:20.034 --> 01:21.500
Mr. President, I suggest

01:21.567 --> 01:23.134
an emergency restructuring.

01:23.201 --> 01:25.700
CTU is no longer
an operational entity.

01:25.767 --> 01:28.533
It's a building with workers
who will report to us.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.167
I can see
no other option right now

01:30.234 --> 01:32.600
but to impose marshal law
on the city of Los Angeles.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.500
What I will not do

01:34.567 --> 01:38.234
is stand by and watch
Hal Gardner use you

01:38.301 --> 01:40.101
to promote his own agenda.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.201
You killed my wife

01:41.267 --> 01:43.734
Michelle Dessler this morning.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.234
She was my life.

01:45.301 --> 01:47.967
And you took her.

01:48.034 --> 01:48.900
My God, he's got a gun.

01:48.967 --> 01:50.034
You can't do this.

01:50.101 --> 01:51.600
We have to get him talking.

01:51.667 --> 01:55.800
He's our only lead to Bierko
and the Sentox gas canisters.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.034
You've had your chance.

01:57.101 --> 01:58.167
He's mine now.

01:58.234 --> 01:59.134
Tony!

02:04.567 --> 02:06.934
Oh, my God!

02:33.567 --> 02:35.301
Jack, I am so sorry.

02:35.368 --> 02:37.201
Security find Henderson yet?
No, he got

02:37.267 --> 02:39.067
out of the building
before the lockdown.

02:39.134 --> 02:42.034
An external cam got a shot
of him as he was leaving.

02:42.101 --> 02:43.900
And the car that he was using
was found a block away.

02:43.967 --> 02:46.001
But I think that we might've
got what we needed from him.

02:46.067 --> 02:47.468
What are you talking about?

02:47.533 --> 02:49.800
Chloe was able to decrypt
a file from his computer.

02:49.867 --> 02:52.134
She got a name of someone
connected to Bierko.

02:52.201 --> 02:53.667
Who's Collette Stenger?

02:53.734 --> 02:56.067
She's an international
intelligence broker.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.967
State secrets,
intellectual property.

02:58.034 --> 02:59.967
What's her connection
to Bierko?

03:00.034 --> 03:01.334
Interpol claims
that she and Bierko

03:01.401 --> 03:02.834
met at least twice over
the last eight months.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.301
And we think she helped
broker the deal.

03:04.368 --> 03:05.533
Is she still in Los Angeles?

03:05.600 --> 03:07.434
She gave a name of
a hotel to customs.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.101
But nothing's to say
that she's actually there.

03:09.167 --> 03:10.567
Curtis is prepping
a tactical team

03:10.633 --> 03:12.834
to try to bring her in.
Okay.
Good work.

03:14.567 --> 03:16.500
( cell phone rings )

03:16.567 --> 03:17.667
Manning.

03:17.734 --> 03:18.667
Curtis, it's Jack.

03:18.734 --> 03:19.700
When is the tac team
leaving?

03:19.767 --> 03:20.934
Right now.
I'm going with you.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.034
All right.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.267
I have no intention...

03:27.533 --> 03:28.767
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

03:28.834 --> 03:30.134
member of the press corps...

03:30.201 --> 03:32.267
Just so you're aware,
there will be no Q&A

03:32.334 --> 03:34.234
following
the president's statement.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.533
But you can submit questions
to my office...

03:36.600 --> 03:38.767
You're having
second thoughts?

03:38.834 --> 03:40.867
Putting soldiers
on the streets of L.A.,

03:40.934 --> 03:43.401
this will not be
a popular announcement.

03:43.468 --> 03:44.533
Maybe not.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.800
But it's the right move.

03:45.867 --> 03:47.301
Hal, would you
excuse us, please?

03:47.368 --> 03:50.001
Mrs. Logan, the president's
about to go on the air.

03:50.067 --> 03:52.001
I'll be brief.

03:52.067 --> 03:54.301
I would like a moment
alone with my husband.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.468
BROWN:
Now, before we begin,

03:56.533 --> 04:00.334
I want to take a second to
address an issue of security.

04:00.401 --> 04:02.834
I understand that many of you
have been here since early...

04:02.900 --> 04:04.167
I've made up
my mind, Martha.

04:04.234 --> 04:06.167
I'm not debating
this anymore.

04:06.234 --> 04:07.234
Just listen, listen please.

04:07.301 --> 04:08.734
Mike Novick spoke
to someone at CTU.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.600
They think they have
a lead on this man,

04:10.667 --> 04:11.301
this man Bierko.

04:11.368 --> 04:12.567
They think they may

04:12.633 --> 04:14.734
find him before he launches
another attack.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.368
CTU was just hit.
40% of their people

04:16.434 --> 04:18.334
are either dead
or unable to work.

04:18.401 --> 04:19.800
To think that they
would be able

04:19.867 --> 04:21.500
to stop this attack, that's
just wishful thinking.

04:21.567 --> 04:22.834
Maybe not.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.368
( sighs )

04:24.434 --> 04:25.767
Bringing the military in

04:25.834 --> 04:27.834
is the best way
to maintain order.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.301
The Vice President's
right about that.

04:30.368 --> 04:31.533
Of course he is.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.700
What's that mean?

04:33.767 --> 04:36.134
Hasn't it ever occurred to you

04:36.201 --> 04:38.834
that he proposed this whole
thing to set you up for a fall?

04:40.401 --> 04:42.301
So he gets the nomination
next year.

04:42.368 --> 04:43.700
That's insane.

04:43.767 --> 04:46.167
Hal's only motivation
is what's best for the country.

04:46.234 --> 04:49.734
There's going to be fallout.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.034
Hal knows it.

04:52.101 --> 04:54.067
And you know it.

04:58.067 --> 04:59.834
I have to go.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.201
Charles...

05:02.267 --> 05:03.368
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:03.434 --> 05:06.934
the President of
the United States.

05:11.334 --> 05:14.834
As you all know,
America has been hit today

05:14.900 --> 05:17.167
by a series
of terrorist strikes,

05:17.234 --> 05:21.900
beginning with the assassination
of former President David Palmer

05:21.967 --> 05:25.101
and the murder of innocent
Americans at Ontario Airport,

05:25.167 --> 05:27.034
followed by
the attempted assassination

05:27.101 --> 05:28.201
of Russian President
Yuri Suvarov.

05:28.267 --> 05:30.434
These events
are being orchestrated

05:30.500 --> 05:34.101
by terrorists
operating within our borders.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.767
Our most recent intelligence
suggests

05:36.834 --> 05:40.800
that they will strike again
and soon.

05:40.867 --> 05:43.533
I can and will
do my sworn duty

05:43.600 --> 05:46.800
to ensure the safety
of the American people.

05:46.867 --> 05:51.101
Therefore I am issuing
an executive order

05:51.167 --> 05:53.867
imposing a curfew
on all civilians

05:53.934 --> 05:56.167
in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.967
This curfew will be effective
immediately and will be

06:00.034 --> 06:03.101
enforced by the military.

06:03.167 --> 06:06.934
As disruptive and distasteful as
I know this is for many of you,

06:07.001 --> 06:11.500
I would ask that you remember
that we are at war.

06:11.567 --> 06:12.734
Bracing ourselves
against future attacks...

06:12.800 --> 06:16.201
D.O.D. is asking for a list
of our casualties.

06:16.267 --> 06:18.001
I don't want any
names released

06:18.067 --> 06:20.667
until the next of kin
have been notified.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.101
Let me know when that happens.

06:29.334 --> 06:31.633
This place is
a sinking ship.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.533
We should be
taking over now,

06:33.600 --> 06:35.334
not going through the
charade of an assessment.

06:35.401 --> 06:36.500
Until we're ready to transition,

06:36.567 --> 06:38.234
we need everyone here
functioning.

06:38.301 --> 06:40.301
Once the remaining canisters
of nerve gas have been found

06:40.368 --> 06:42.500
and the terrorists captured,

06:42.567 --> 06:44.167
then we'll assume full control.

06:44.234 --> 06:45.167
Karen.

06:45.234 --> 06:46.500
Hello, Bill.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.667
Bill Buchanan,
Miles Papazian from my office.

06:48.734 --> 06:51.034
I appreciate your coming,
but that wasn't necessary.

06:51.101 --> 06:52.667
We just need to replace
some key personnel.

06:52.734 --> 06:54.734
We're all sorry
about the loss of lives here,

06:54.800 --> 06:57.434
but the White House feels
you may need more than that.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.700
They want an assessment

06:58.767 --> 07:01.034
of how Homeland
may best assist CTU.

07:03.667 --> 07:04.834
I'll brief you in my office.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.034
Fine.

07:06.101 --> 07:07.368
Miles, familiarize yourself

07:07.434 --> 07:09.001
with the networks,
and then start the survey.

07:09.067 --> 07:10.700
Let's go.

07:10.767 --> 07:12.201
Upstairs.

07:19.334 --> 07:20.267
Chloe O'Brian?

07:20.334 --> 07:21.301
Who are you?

07:21.368 --> 07:22.667
Homeland Security.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.167
I asked your name,
not who you work for.

07:24.234 --> 07:26.434
I need a vacant station set up.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.001
I'm kind of busy right now.

07:28.067 --> 07:29.834
I'm seeing Edgar Stiles
listed on my report

07:29.900 --> 07:31.401
as a casualty.

07:33.468 --> 07:35.533
Is that right?

07:35.600 --> 07:38.401
Yeah.

07:38.468 --> 07:40.301
Then his station
should be available.

07:40.368 --> 07:41.633
I'll set up over there.

07:44.767 --> 07:45.734
I'll be reinstalling
operating protocols

07:45.800 --> 07:46.767
for everyone in your group,

07:46.834 --> 07:47.900
so I'll need your keycard.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.034
No.

07:49.101 --> 07:51.500
I'm sorry?

07:51.567 --> 07:53.800
You can't have my keycard.

07:53.867 --> 07:56.533
We're here with a priority
admin directive.

07:56.600 --> 08:01.234
You can confirm that with your
supervisor on your own time.

08:17.101 --> 08:19.734
REPORTER:
We're live in Los Angeles,
where just a few minutes ago,

08:19.800 --> 08:22.234
Army units
stationed in L.A. County

08:22.301 --> 08:25.201
began moving in force
across city limits.

08:25.267 --> 08:28.600
This is the first time a
military presence of this scale

08:28.667 --> 08:31.234
has been activated
in a major metropolitan area.

08:31.301 --> 08:33.700
While White House officials
have stopped short

08:33.767 --> 08:36.201
of officially declaring
full-scale martial law...

08:36.267 --> 08:37.167
Where are you going?

08:37.234 --> 08:39.967
I just need some fresh air.

08:40.034 --> 08:41.667
These mobile Army divisions
were activated

08:41.734 --> 08:42.933
shortly after
the President's press conference

08:43.001 --> 08:46.633
in which he declared
an enforced curfew.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.067
Officials are hoping
the curfew will prevent

08:48.134 --> 08:50.468
further acts of terror.

08:50.533 --> 08:52.267
I do not trust him.

08:52.334 --> 08:54.600
Ma'am?

08:54.667 --> 08:57.234
The Vice President.

09:00.234 --> 09:04.800
( cell phone ringing )

09:04.867 --> 09:06.434
This is Aaron Pierce.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.267
Aaron, it's Wayne Palmer.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.334
Sir, I am so sorry

09:14.401 --> 09:18.167
about President Palmer,
more sorry than I can describe.

09:18.234 --> 09:20.234
Aaron, I know how close
you were to my brother.

09:20.301 --> 09:22.500
You must have known
he felt the same way about you.

09:22.567 --> 09:24.667
Thank you for saying that.

09:24.734 --> 09:27.201
Actually, Aaron,
he's the reason I'm calling.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.434
There's something
from my brother

09:28.500 --> 09:29.834
I need to give you
personally.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.434
I should be there
within the hour.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.800
You're coming here?

09:32.867 --> 09:34.134
Yeah, I know
it sounds impulsive, Aaron.

09:34.201 --> 09:35.600
But I'd rather see you
sooner than later.

09:35.667 --> 09:38.468
There's a curfew in effect, sir.

09:38.533 --> 09:40.533
I know, I know.
I left before it was declared.

09:40.600 --> 09:45.134
If I may say so, this
is an odd request.

09:45.201 --> 09:47.468
Aaron, my brother
trusted you with his life.

09:47.533 --> 09:49.633
I am asking you to trust me.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.201
All right.

09:51.267 --> 09:53.667
I'd also appreciate it if
you would keep this between us.

09:53.734 --> 09:57.368
I'm hoping there's somewhere
we can meet discreetly.

09:57.434 --> 09:58.900
I'll find a place.

09:58.967 --> 09:59.900
Thank you, Aaron.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.900
I'll call you when I'm close.

10:08.201 --> 10:10.134
REPORTER:
The effects of this action
will no doubt

10:10.201 --> 10:13.201
ripple across the country, as
other cities begin to take note.

10:13.267 --> 10:14.867
So while legislators debate

10:14.934 --> 10:16.934
the legality
of President Logan's action,

10:17.001 --> 10:18.734
martial law is already a fact...

10:18.800 --> 10:20.001
Mike, turn it off.

10:20.067 --> 10:22.167
...on the ground,
here in Los Angeles.

10:22.234 --> 10:24.101
( TV turns off )

10:24.167 --> 10:27.201
"Debate the legality
of President Logan's action."

10:27.267 --> 10:28.301
Did you hear that?

10:28.368 --> 10:29.734
They're talking about this

10:29.800 --> 10:31.834
like it's
an illegal action.

10:31.900 --> 10:34.500
Don't worry, Mr. President.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.700
I'm in control of the situation.

10:36.767 --> 10:38.633
Our legal people are
working on it right now.

10:44.167 --> 10:48.734
Do we have
anything more from CTU?

10:48.800 --> 10:51.001
They're still following
up on this Bierko lead.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.468
As soon as they have
something to report,

10:53.533 --> 10:55.600
we'll be the first to hear.

11:00.167 --> 11:04.134
Give me details of the current
threat assessment.

11:04.201 --> 11:05.167
There's a high probability

11:05.234 --> 11:06.500
that Bierko is
planning an attack

11:06.567 --> 11:08.600
on a much larger scale
than anything we've seen today.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.667
That's why he
targeted CTU--

11:10.734 --> 11:12.401
to cripple our ability
to stop him.

11:12.468 --> 11:15.134
And the question is:
Was he successful?

11:15.201 --> 11:16.967
When you look
at the numbers,

11:17.034 --> 11:19.034
you were harder hit
than you thought, Bill.

11:19.101 --> 11:20.334
We're still functioning.

11:20.401 --> 11:21.767
Maybe not at a 100%,

11:21.834 --> 11:24.001
but when you install
the people I've asked for...

11:24.067 --> 11:25.234
we'll be back
to fighting strength.

11:25.301 --> 11:27.368
Have you made any progress
finding Bierko?

11:27.434 --> 11:29.600
We've identified a woman
we believe might lead us to him.

11:29.667 --> 11:31.234
Collette Stenger.

11:31.301 --> 11:33.401
We've just sent a tac team
to bring her in.

11:34.434 --> 11:35.700
Good.

11:42.468 --> 11:43.934
I enjoy watching
you get dressed

11:44.001 --> 11:47.434
almost as much as I enjoy
watching you get undressed.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.201
You should get dressed yourself

11:49.267 --> 11:51.401
and send
the bags down.

11:51.468 --> 11:53.800
This deal you're working on,

11:53.867 --> 11:55.867
I hope you're getting
a lot of money for it.

11:55.934 --> 11:58.633
I never talk about my business,
you know that.

11:58.700 --> 11:59.900
I know...

11:59.967 --> 12:02.301
but Maria called about
this villa in Positano.

12:02.368 --> 12:04.633
She said when you see it,
you'll love it.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.734
We'll call her later.

12:13.034 --> 12:14.633
I'll see you at
the airport, okay?

12:14.700 --> 12:17.334
In 45 minutes.

12:17.401 --> 12:19.401
I'll be there.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.700
( cell phone ringing )

12:26.767 --> 12:27.700
Yes.

12:27.767 --> 12:29.301
I'm on my way.

12:29.368 --> 12:31.368
And you have
everything I asked for?

12:31.434 --> 12:32.201
Of course.

12:32.267 --> 12:33.401
Good.

12:33.468 --> 12:34.434
Do you have
the money?

12:34.500 --> 12:35.468
As soon as I verify

12:35.533 --> 12:36.667
the merchandise,

12:36.734 --> 12:38.834
I'll have it transferred
to your account.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.401
I'll be there soon.

12:42.401 --> 12:45.301
Does she have the schematics
and the access codes?

12:45.368 --> 12:46.600
Yes.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.067
Everything we need.

12:48.134 --> 12:50.867
The Distribution Center is
a difficult target.

12:50.934 --> 12:53.633
It would be much easier
to hit a less secure location.

12:53.700 --> 12:57.067
No, Mikhail, this is the place.

12:57.134 --> 12:59.234
Release
the Sentox here...

13:00.967 --> 13:04.767
and 200,000 people die.

13:18.334 --> 13:19.934
And we need a second satellite

13:20.001 --> 13:21.467
repositioned as
soon as possible.

13:21.533 --> 13:23.734
Good. Thank you.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.201
I saw a request

13:25.268 --> 13:26.634
for proficiency evaluations
for all CTU personnel

13:26.700 --> 13:28.034
on my secondary
screen.

13:28.101 --> 13:29.301
That's a formality.

13:29.368 --> 13:30.901
The fact is, we don't have time
for evaluations

13:30.967 --> 13:32.667
right now.
Then why was it put
in the pipeline?

13:32.734 --> 13:34.234
Like I said, it's a formality.

13:34.301 --> 13:36.767
You're here to shut
this place down, aren't you?

13:36.834 --> 13:38.234
And the evaluations
will be filled in later

13:38.301 --> 13:39.301
as a matter of protocol.

13:39.368 --> 13:40.467
I told you before,
the White House...

13:40.533 --> 13:42.268
I know what you told me before.

13:43.834 --> 13:45.800
Now tell me the truth.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.001
The truth is, CTU is being
absorbed by Homeland.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.301
Which means,
from now on,

13:56.368 --> 13:58.433
every operational decision
needs to go through me.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.800
Bill, what
did you expect?

14:00.867 --> 14:01.800
You've been infiltrated.

14:01.867 --> 14:02.800
56 of your people

14:02.867 --> 14:03.867
have been killed.

14:03.934 --> 14:04.834
The others are
demoralized...

14:04.901 --> 14:06.201
They're not demoralized,

14:06.268 --> 14:07.167
they're angry!

14:07.234 --> 14:08.334
They want to fight back.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.301
They're willing
to lay down their lives.

14:10.368 --> 14:11.634
Some already
have...

14:11.700 --> 14:12.734
It's done, Bill.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.134
The decision's been made.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.167
And I know
neither one of us

14:16.234 --> 14:17.301
wants this transition
to interfere

14:17.368 --> 14:18.301
with ongoing protocol,

14:18.368 --> 14:20.533
so let's just
keep it between us.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.101
At least until
this crisis plays out.

14:33.101 --> 14:34.567
There.

14:36.967 --> 14:39.034
Bill?

14:40.533 --> 14:43.301
Homeland is being overly
aggressive with their survey.

14:43.368 --> 14:44.301
What is going on?

14:44.368 --> 14:45.667
Nothing.

14:45.734 --> 14:47.600
It's just a formality.

14:47.667 --> 14:50.533
They'll be gone as soon as
they finish their evaluation.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.067
Where are we on
the military mobilization?

14:56.334 --> 14:57.400
Martial law is in effect

14:57.467 --> 14:58.967
in nine of the
15 L.A. districts.

14:59.034 --> 15:01.433
I'm setting up checkpoints for
the rest of the county now.

15:03.533 --> 15:05.268
I hope the president's
doing the right thing.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.134
CURTIS:
Alpha Team,

15:19.201 --> 15:20.667
we're approaching
Collette Stenger's
apartment

15:20.734 --> 15:21.700
and we're ready to move.

15:21.767 --> 15:22.967
Are you in position?

15:23.034 --> 15:23.901
AGENT ( over radio ):
Affirmative.

15:23.967 --> 15:25.500
We've got the lobby covered.

15:25.567 --> 15:26.567
CURTIS:
Copy.

16:04.034 --> 16:05.700
I think she went for the roof.

16:05.767 --> 16:06.901
Cover the stairs.

16:09.867 --> 16:11.001
Let's go.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.500
We're going up top.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.467
JACK:
Drop the gun!

17:14.867 --> 17:16.166
Stand down or he dies!

17:22.233 --> 17:24.300
I said stand down!

17:27.300 --> 17:28.834
Our people are all around you.

17:28.901 --> 17:32.901
They will drop you before
you could pull that trigger.

17:32.967 --> 17:34.667
Put the gun down!

17:34.734 --> 17:36.201
What do you mean
your "people?"

17:36.268 --> 17:37.433
Who are you?

17:37.500 --> 17:40.567
Counter Terrorist Unit,
Los Angeles.

17:43.734 --> 17:44.834
Show me identification.

17:56.734 --> 17:58.533
I'm with the German Federal
Intelligence Service.

18:00.301 --> 18:01.567
My name's Theo Stoller.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.101
What are you doing
in this country?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.901
I'm here on
special assignment...

18:06.967 --> 18:08.934
by agreement between
our governments.

18:09.001 --> 18:10.834
Now you can get
the hell out of here

18:10.901 --> 18:12.400
before you
destroy my cover.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.600
That's not going to happen.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.167
CHLOE ( over phone ):
O'Brian.

18:22.234 --> 18:23.201
Chloe, it's Jack.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.600
I want you to check

18:24.667 --> 18:26.234
on a foreign agent
on the SA list.

18:26.301 --> 18:27.700
"Theo Stoller."

18:27.767 --> 18:28.767
Okay.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.201
Got it:
"Theo Stoller,

18:33.268 --> 18:35.901
height, 5'll",
brown hair, brown eyes."

18:35.967 --> 18:36.934
He's a German operative,

18:37.001 --> 18:38.901
but trained in England
at MI-6.

18:38.967 --> 18:41.134
There's even contact
information: cell phone...

18:41.201 --> 18:42.167
That's all right,
Chloe.

18:42.234 --> 18:43.167
That's enough,
thanks.

18:43.234 --> 18:45.400
I told you,

18:45.467 --> 18:46.667
you have to get
out of here now.

18:46.734 --> 18:47.800
We can't do that.

18:47.867 --> 18:49.134
You were with
Collette Stenger.

18:49.201 --> 18:51.201
We need her to help us
find Vladimir Bierko.

18:51.268 --> 18:52.201
I don't know him.

18:52.268 --> 18:53.201
Bierko's responsible

18:53.268 --> 18:54.433
for the terrorist attacks

18:54.500 --> 18:55.734
that took place
in the city earlier today.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.967
He's preparing to mount
another one as we speak.

18:58.034 --> 18:59.967
Collette Stenger is the only way
we can find him.

19:00.034 --> 19:01.034
Where is she?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.268
I can't help you.
Why not?

19:04.334 --> 19:07.567
Giving you Collette
jeopardizes my operation.

19:07.634 --> 19:09.667
What operation?

19:09.734 --> 19:11.600
I've been undercover
for the last six months

19:11.667 --> 19:13.433
gathering intel
on Collette's clientele.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.301
We've identified cells
in three countries,

19:16.368 --> 19:18.334
but she's connected
to a dozen more.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.600
She's too valuable to give up.

19:19.667 --> 19:21.167
If we don't find Bierko,

19:21.234 --> 19:22.800
hundreds of thousands
of innocent people

19:22.867 --> 19:24.334
will die here today.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.567
That is more important than
your preemptive operation.

19:26.634 --> 19:28.467
It's not a question
of importance,

19:28.533 --> 19:30.301
it's a question
of different agendas.

19:30.368 --> 19:32.734
Your job is to save
American lives.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.368
Mine to save German lives.

19:35.634 --> 19:36.867
You're asking me
to betray

19:36.934 --> 19:39.001
my duty to my country.

19:39.067 --> 19:41.767
Ask yourself what you
would do in my position.

19:41.834 --> 19:43.067
You better start
asking yourself

19:43.134 --> 19:44.368
what you would do
in mine.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.667
Now, let's go.

19:45.734 --> 19:47.134
I'm here by permission
of your government--

19:47.201 --> 19:48.167
you can't touch me.

19:48.234 --> 19:49.167
Right.

19:49.234 --> 19:50.268
We'll see about that.

20:43.667 --> 20:45.500
Well, make sure that
your superior understands

20:45.567 --> 20:47.168
that if this attack happens,

20:47.234 --> 20:50.433
my government will hold
your country accountable.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.433
Jack, it's Buchanan.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.934
Audrey will be joining us
momentarily.

20:55.001 --> 20:56.634
You're also on the line
with Karen Hayes

20:56.700 --> 20:58.300
from Homeland Security.

20:58.367 --> 21:00.433
She's been providing support
to CTU, and she's also

21:00.500 --> 21:02.067
been in contact
with the White House.

21:02.134 --> 21:04.268
Did President Logan get in touch
with the German Chancellor?

21:04.333 --> 21:05.567
He's tried;

21:05.634 --> 21:06.901
the chancellor's
unreachable for
another hour.

21:06.967 --> 21:08.467
We don't have
another hour.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.667
They're stalling, there's
nothing we can do about that.

21:10.734 --> 21:12.034
Jack, this is Audrey.

21:12.101 --> 21:13.333
I was just speaking
with German Intelligence.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.168
They're refusing
to order their agent

21:15.234 --> 21:16.734
to cooperate with us.

21:16.801 --> 21:18.134
Maybe you can get
a deal with him.

21:18.201 --> 21:19.700
Okay, I'll talk
to Stoller again.

21:19.767 --> 21:21.734
Good. Call me
if you get him
to change his mind.

21:21.801 --> 21:23.433
Yeah.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.567
Curtis?

21:27.834 --> 21:29.801
Let me have a moment
with him alone.

21:29.867 --> 21:31.101
Jack, what are you doing?

21:31.168 --> 21:33.034
It's all right.

21:34.034 --> 21:35.001
All right.

21:42.367 --> 21:43.967
Your intelligence service

21:44.034 --> 21:47.168
denied our request
for cooperation.

21:47.234 --> 21:48.467
So has your government.

21:48.534 --> 21:50.201
I'm not surprised.

21:50.268 --> 21:52.367
Collette Stenger
is a golden goose.

21:52.433 --> 21:54.667
There's no upside
in giving her up.

21:56.134 --> 21:58.333
Maybe I could provide you
with one.

21:59.367 --> 22:02.967
Meaning?

22:04.001 --> 22:05.400
I will give you something

22:05.467 --> 22:07.901
that is more valuable
than Collette Stenger.

22:10.467 --> 22:13.268
It's hard to know
what that might be.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.600
Our roster of all known
terror suspects

22:15.667 --> 22:18.034
working around the world,
our WET list.

22:20.067 --> 22:22.534
As allies, we've requested
this WET list

22:22.600 --> 22:24.534
many times before.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.967
But the NSA has always said,

22:27.034 --> 22:28.867
giving us the
list would

22:28.934 --> 22:30.634
jeopardize their operations.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.333
It will.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.734
I don't work for the NSA,
I don't work for CTU.

22:34.801 --> 22:36.734
This is personal.

22:36.801 --> 22:39.567
And right now, you're not
giving me another choice.

22:39.634 --> 22:41.001
All right.

22:41.067 --> 22:43.201
I'll give you Collette

22:43.268 --> 22:45.201
in exchange for the WET list.

22:45.268 --> 22:46.433
Okay.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.500
Let's see what we can do.

22:50.634 --> 22:52.767
Agent Bauer.

22:52.834 --> 22:56.234
I'm aware of several names
that should be on that list.

22:56.300 --> 22:58.268
Don't try and pass me a fake.

22:59.634 --> 23:00.567
( phone ringing )

23:00.634 --> 23:01.567
O'Brian.

23:01.634 --> 23:02.801
Chloe, it's Jack.

23:02.867 --> 23:04.534
Do we still have a back door
into NSA's

23:04.600 --> 23:05.667
secured mainframe?

23:05.734 --> 23:07.001
I can't really talk
right now, Jack.

23:07.067 --> 23:09.101
Okay, fine. Then, listen.

23:09.168 --> 23:11.867
I need you to log on to their
server, download the WET list,

23:11.934 --> 23:13.268
and send it to my
PDA immediately.

23:13.333 --> 23:14.600
Why?

23:14.667 --> 23:16.400
The WET list is what
we're gonna have to pay

23:16.467 --> 23:17.600
to get Collette Stenger.

23:17.667 --> 23:20.534
Jack, that list is
as top secret as it gets.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.934
Homeland Security
sent a team over here.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.634
You're gonna have
to clear it with them.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.001
We can't afford
to take the chance
of them saying no.

23:26.067 --> 23:28.333
I'm not saying I won't do it
without their approval.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.534
I'm saying I can't.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.767
They took my keycard.

23:30.834 --> 23:32.834
I can't get into the NSA
mainframe without it.

23:32.901 --> 23:34.001
Just do what you have to.

23:34.067 --> 23:35.500
It's our only way
to get Bierko.

23:35.567 --> 23:37.834
Fine. I'll call you back.

23:58.767 --> 24:00.801
Excuse me, Miles.

24:00.867 --> 24:02.333
Oh!
( gasps ):
My God!

24:02.400 --> 24:03.834
What is the
matter with you?

24:03.901 --> 24:05.134
Sorry.

24:06.901 --> 24:08.500
What's wrong with you?

24:08.567 --> 24:12.134
I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

24:33.834 --> 24:35.967
JACK:
Yeah?

24:36.034 --> 24:37.667
Jack, I got on the NSA server.

24:37.734 --> 24:38.834
Did you get the file?

24:38.901 --> 24:40.201
Not yet. They put
an extra layer

24:40.268 --> 24:41.268
of authentication
in place.

24:41.333 --> 24:42.367
Can you get around it?

24:42.433 --> 24:44.534
Hold on.

24:47.634 --> 24:49.067
Okay, I got it.

24:49.134 --> 24:50.700
I hope you know
what you're doing.

24:50.767 --> 24:52.300
I'm uploading it now.

24:52.367 --> 24:53.600
Thanks.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.367
I got it.

25:36.001 --> 25:39.168
Well, that appears legitimate.

25:39.234 --> 25:41.901
It is.

25:41.967 --> 25:44.634
Give me back the memory card.

25:44.700 --> 25:46.667
You can't upload the WET list
to your people

25:46.734 --> 25:49.067
until I have Collette Stenger
in custody.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.268
Well, fair enough.

25:53.333 --> 25:54.801
We have to go now.

25:54.867 --> 25:57.101
I'm supposed to meet her
at the Van Nuys airport

25:57.168 --> 25:58.567
in less than 20 minutes.

25:58.634 --> 26:00.168
What kind of a car
is she driving?

26:00.234 --> 26:01.767
I don't know.

26:01.834 --> 26:04.234
I'm supposed to
park in car Lot C
and wait for her.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.300
She'll probably
recon the area before
she makes contact.

26:06.367 --> 26:08.700
She's, uh, cautious by habit.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.834
Curtis, we're on the move--
Van Nuys Airport.

26:10.901 --> 26:13.400
We'll give you the details
when we're on the way.

26:16.001 --> 26:19.201
When you receive the funds,
transfer them immediately

26:19.268 --> 26:20.500
into the Caymans account.

26:20.567 --> 26:22.300
In Euros.

26:24.801 --> 26:27.700
My bank is ready
to accept the transfer.

26:37.867 --> 26:40.034
The file is encrypted.

26:40.101 --> 26:41.801
What is the decryption key?

26:41.867 --> 26:45.333
Transfer the funds.

26:52.734 --> 26:53.901
It's been sent.

26:54.934 --> 26:57.500
Thank you.

26:57.567 --> 27:00.300
E-mail me confirmation
of the transfer.

27:12.567 --> 27:16.300
The decryption key is
Charlie alpha three nine

27:16.367 --> 27:17.433
alpha.

27:21.634 --> 27:22.700
It worked.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.067
This is what you wanted.

27:24.134 --> 27:26.367
Of course it is.

27:28.067 --> 27:31.433
Until next time, gentlemen.

27:38.101 --> 27:39.467
Are the men ready?

27:39.534 --> 27:40.634
Yes.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.934
Torch this place.

27:42.001 --> 27:44.067
We're moving out.

27:56.334 --> 27:58.767
Governor, I'm not trying
to co-opt your authority,

27:58.834 --> 28:01.467
but we are in the middle
of a crisis here.

28:01.534 --> 28:04.601
Now, you can either transmit
my orders word for word

28:04.667 --> 28:06.868
to the National Guard,
or I can federalize them,

28:06.934 --> 28:07.934
and give them
my orders

28:08.000 --> 28:09.634
directly, your choice.

28:09.701 --> 28:11.267
Excellent.

28:11.334 --> 28:12.667
Thank you, Governor.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.367
I look forward
to your cooperation.

28:14.434 --> 28:16.400
Sir, we have a situation
at one of the roadblocks

28:16.467 --> 28:18.400
that the region three commander
needs your call on.

28:18.467 --> 28:20.234
Tell me.
Wayne Palmer is insisting

28:20.300 --> 28:22.334
he be let through one
of our roadblocks.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.434
He claims he still has
his clearance and that he's on

28:25.501 --> 28:27.200
official business.
And where exactly is that?

28:27.267 --> 28:29.067
He was stopped trying
to get on the access road

28:29.133 --> 28:30.167
coming towards
the retreat.

28:30.234 --> 28:32.000
He's on his way here?
To do what?

28:32.067 --> 28:33.868
He wouldn't give
the officer in charge

28:33.934 --> 28:36.367
of the roadblock
any information.

28:37.634 --> 28:39.367
What should I tell
the roadblock, sir?

28:44.200 --> 28:46.033
Captain, all I'm asking you
to do is call and confirm

28:46.100 --> 28:47.968
I have a grade two clearance,
that's it.

28:48.067 --> 28:49.234
Sir, regardless
of your clearance,

28:49.300 --> 28:51.067
authorization to let you through

28:51.133 --> 28:53.667
must come down through the
appropriate chain of command.

28:53.734 --> 28:56.033
And just who would that be,
huh, Captain?

28:56.100 --> 28:58.734
Who's in charge
of the military's role in this?

28:58.801 --> 29:00.934
( phone ringing )

29:02.667 --> 29:04.701
Riggs.

29:05.734 --> 29:07.534
Understood.

29:09.567 --> 29:11.234
Thank you, sir.

29:11.300 --> 29:13.133
You can go on through
now, sir.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.534
Let him through.

29:14.601 --> 29:16.701
Thank you, Captain.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.434
CURTIS:
All teams are in position, Jack.

29:30.501 --> 29:32.067
No one moves in

29:32.133 --> 29:33.834
until I confirm that it's her.

29:33.901 --> 29:35.367
Copy that.

29:35.434 --> 29:38.267
Collette won't show herself
if she senses anything's wrong.

29:38.334 --> 29:40.200
Make sure he stays hidden.

29:40.267 --> 29:42.367
Don't worry. He will.

29:43.767 --> 29:45.234
What will happen to her?

29:45.300 --> 29:48.067
To Collette.

29:48.133 --> 29:49.501
I don't know yet. Why?

29:49.567 --> 29:51.834
Uh, just curious.

29:51.901 --> 29:53.767
You've been in
my situation?

29:53.834 --> 29:58.167
I've been undercover for long
stretches of time, yeah.

29:58.234 --> 30:00.601
And been involved with a woman
during that time?

30:03.601 --> 30:06.968
There's no question we are doing
what has to be done

30:07.033 --> 30:10.133
for our countries,
but sometimes it's
harder than others.

30:12.667 --> 30:15.767
Chloe, could you join us in
the Situation Room, please?

30:15.834 --> 30:17.868
Sure.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.067
What's going on?

30:32.133 --> 30:34.634
Why don't you tell us,
Ms. O'Brian?

30:34.701 --> 30:36.501
I don't know.

30:36.567 --> 30:40.868
We've got you hacking
into a top secret NSA archive.

30:40.934 --> 30:42.567
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:42.634 --> 30:43.834
MILES:
I pulled a mirrored archive

30:43.901 --> 30:45.000
of your web traffic.

30:45.067 --> 30:46.234
Whatever you took from NSA

30:46.300 --> 30:47.634
was uploaded to Jack Bauer's

30:47.701 --> 30:49.801
remote node.

30:49.868 --> 30:51.834
Ms. O'Brian, tell us exactly
what document

30:51.901 --> 30:53.534
you passed to Jack Bauer.

30:54.567 --> 30:57.200
BUCHANAN:
Chloe,

30:57.267 --> 30:59.434
this is going to get much worse
if you force me

30:59.501 --> 31:00.834
to have NSA run a back trace.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.934
What is it?

31:04.067 --> 31:06.000
Jack needed the WET List.

31:06.067 --> 31:07.701
What?!

31:07.767 --> 31:09.968
Why on earth
would you give him that?

31:10.033 --> 31:12.601
Theo Stoller wouldn't lead us
to Collette Stenger without it.

31:12.667 --> 31:14.267
Chloe, giving that list

31:14.334 --> 31:17.300
to another intelligence
agency could be disastrous.

31:17.367 --> 31:18.601
Years of work could
be rendered useless,

31:18.667 --> 31:20.267
our own agents could be exposed.

31:20.334 --> 31:21.534
Jack needed it, okay?

31:21.601 --> 31:22.968
No! No, it's not okay.

31:23.033 --> 31:25.133
And you expected us
to give your agents a chance?

31:27.267 --> 31:29.534
Get me Bauer.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.000
( phone ringing )

31:37.067 --> 31:39.868
Put it on speaker phone, or
I'm getting out of this car.

31:39.934 --> 31:42.934
Fine.

31:44.534 --> 31:46.934
This is Bauer.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.534
BUCHANAN:
Jack, it's Bill.

31:48.601 --> 31:49.968
Karen Hayes is here, as well.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.133
If you're with
Theo Stoller,

31:52.200 --> 31:54.000
get some place you
can talk privately.

31:54.067 --> 31:55.934
I can't. We're in the middle
of an operation.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.567
If I move,
I'll jeopardize our position.

31:57.634 --> 31:59.834
Then you'll have to have this
conversation in front of him.

31:59.901 --> 32:01.667
Have you given him
the WET List yet?

32:01.734 --> 32:02.901
Yes.

32:02.968 --> 32:04.567
Has he given it
to German Intelligence?

32:04.634 --> 32:05.968
No.
Then get it back. Now.

32:06.033 --> 32:07.367
I can't.

32:07.434 --> 32:10.000
If I do that,
Stoller won't cooperate.

32:10.067 --> 32:11.467
And then
we'll lose Collette Stenger.

32:11.534 --> 32:13.234
Bill, will you explain this
to her?

32:13.300 --> 32:14.734
It's not his decision.

32:14.801 --> 32:16.033
Retrieve the WET list now,

32:16.100 --> 32:18.801
or I will order Agent Manning
and his team to do it.

32:18.868 --> 32:21.868
Right now, Collette Stenger is
our only connection to Bierko.

32:21.934 --> 32:23.901
If you blow this operation,
you will be responsible

32:23.968 --> 32:25.868
for every life lost
in his next attack.

32:25.934 --> 32:28.133
I don't like to be threatened,
Mr. Bauer.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.234
Ms. Hayes, that's not a threat,
that's a fact.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.534
HAYES:
German Intelligence
will move preemptively

32:32.601 --> 32:34.033
on people
that we have been

32:34.100 --> 32:35.334
watching for years.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.067
Our ability to prevent
terrorist attacks

32:37.133 --> 32:38.534
will be severely threatened.

32:38.601 --> 32:40.067
Then that's a risk
we'll have to take.

32:40.133 --> 32:42.067
Right now, we have to deal
with this situation.

32:42.133 --> 32:43.067
It's not your call.

32:43.133 --> 32:44.367
It's not mine, either.

32:44.434 --> 32:46.234
We need authorization
from the President.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.400
Then get it.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.767
CURTIS:
Jack, one of our forward teams

32:49.834 --> 32:51.367
I.D.'d a woman fitting
Stenger's description

32:51.434 --> 32:53.934
driving a red Lexus making its
second circuit around the lot.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.234
This could be her.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.901
We have a possible suspect
approaching.

32:57.968 --> 32:59.133
Ms. Hayes, are you

32:59.200 --> 33:01.501
telling me that I have
to abort this operation?

33:01.567 --> 33:02.534
Yes or no?

33:03.767 --> 33:05.267
Ms. Hayes, this is your call.

33:05.334 --> 33:07.534
You don't know for certain
that this woman

33:07.601 --> 33:08.868
will lead us to Bierko.

33:08.934 --> 33:10.000
No, not for certain.

33:10.067 --> 33:12.267
But, right now,
she's our only lead.

33:12.334 --> 33:14.400
Are you willing
to take this chance?

33:14.467 --> 33:16.300
You've left me no choice.

33:16.367 --> 33:17.701
Proceed.

33:17.767 --> 33:20.067
But you have severely
compromised this situation

33:20.133 --> 33:23.267
and I promise you there
will be repercussions.

33:23.334 --> 33:24.367
Fine.

33:26.534 --> 33:28.400
Are we all right?

33:28.467 --> 33:31.434
We're fine.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.234
CURTIS:
Red Lexus turning the corner.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.400
A hundred yards away
and approaching.

33:38.467 --> 33:41.167
No one move until I give a go.

33:50.234 --> 33:52.501
The red Lexus is parked.

33:52.567 --> 33:56.133
Move the center mirror,
so that I can see the car.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.033
There.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.901
Now get her out of the car.

34:20.667 --> 34:23.300
Hi.

34:23.367 --> 34:24.501
Hello.

34:26.234 --> 34:28.199
JACK:
I have a positive I.D.

34:28.266 --> 34:29.467
All teams move in.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.067
All teams move, move, move!
Let's go!

34:32.601 --> 34:33.801
Put your hands
where I can see them!

34:33.868 --> 34:34.934
Theo, get in the car, now.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.367
Let me see your hands!
What are you doing?

34:36.434 --> 34:38.033
Now!
Let me go.

34:38.100 --> 34:39.367
Theo, get out of there.

34:39.434 --> 34:40.900
I'm sorry.

34:40.967 --> 34:42.634
Theo, who are you?

34:42.701 --> 34:43.467
Move!

34:43.534 --> 34:44.967
Letting him go.

34:45.033 --> 34:45.833
He's given us
what we want!

34:45.900 --> 34:47.734
Put your hands up!

34:48.900 --> 34:51.801
Turn and face the car!

34:51.868 --> 34:52.868
Put your hands on the roof!

34:57.734 --> 34:58.934
Do it!

35:18.300 --> 35:19.634
Where is Bierko?

35:21.100 --> 35:23.234
We know you're
working with Bierko.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.167
Where is he?

35:25.834 --> 35:27.567
Fine.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.100
Take her back to staging.

35:34.167 --> 35:35.868
I want a team
searching this car.

35:35.934 --> 35:38.100
Take everything back
to the staging area.

35:38.167 --> 35:39.667
Now!

35:49.501 --> 35:50.634
It's Theo.

35:50.701 --> 35:52.601
I'm en route to the hotel.

35:52.667 --> 35:54.534
Tell Heinrich
I'm uploading something

35:54.601 --> 35:56.400
he's been wanting
for a long time.

36:24.167 --> 36:26.567
( phone rings )

36:26.634 --> 36:28.434
Stoller.

36:28.501 --> 36:29.734
Theo, it's Jack.

36:29.801 --> 36:30.767
I'm sorry.

36:30.834 --> 36:31.968
I thought we had a deal.

36:32.033 --> 36:33.434
When this is over,
I promise you,

36:33.501 --> 36:35.501
I will help you rebuild
your investigation.

36:35.567 --> 36:36.501
I give you my word.

36:36.567 --> 36:38.234
I had your word.

36:57.368 --> 36:58.301
What have you got?

36:58.368 --> 36:59.334
Nothing.

36:59.433 --> 37:00.467
She's covered
her tracks.

37:00.533 --> 37:01.467
There's no sign

37:01.533 --> 37:03.368
of what she sold to Bierko.

37:03.433 --> 37:04.800
Come with me.

37:08.268 --> 37:11.767
Collette Stenger,
my name is Jack Bauer.

37:11.834 --> 37:13.600
Who is Theo really?

37:13.667 --> 37:15.101
German Intelligence.

37:15.167 --> 37:16.834
Then he sold me for a price.

37:16.901 --> 37:20.567
German and American Intelligence
don't work together often.

37:20.634 --> 37:21.767
Where is Bierko?

37:21.834 --> 37:26.767
The fact is, I actually
had feelings for Theo.

37:26.834 --> 37:28.134
I never once suspected.

37:28.201 --> 37:30.867
He was very good.

37:30.934 --> 37:32.034
I always thought that there

37:32.101 --> 37:33.700
were some things
that you cannot fake.

37:36.767 --> 37:38.433
Bierko.

37:40.201 --> 37:43.101
Tell them to leave.

37:43.167 --> 37:44.800
Jack?

37:44.867 --> 37:46.467
It's all right.

37:47.467 --> 37:48.500
Curtis, have your men
move back.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.467
Just give us a second.

37:50.533 --> 37:52.834
Let's go.

37:58.901 --> 38:00.167
Theo had a price.

38:00.234 --> 38:02.001
What's yours?
I'm not for sale.

38:02.067 --> 38:03.433
Everyone is for sale.

38:03.500 --> 38:04.433
This isn't a game, lady.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.567
We're running out of time.

38:05.634 --> 38:06.901
You better tell me
what you want.

38:08.001 --> 38:09.867
All right.

38:09.934 --> 38:12.667
Full immunity.
No holdbacks.

38:12.734 --> 38:15.368
Signed by your president
and transmitted to lawyers

38:15.433 --> 38:17.134
in Zurich and Tripoli.

38:17.201 --> 38:18.134
But I can't tell you
where Bierko is.

38:18.201 --> 38:19.700
Why not?

38:19.767 --> 38:20.867
Because he's already gone.

38:20.934 --> 38:22.400
I met him at a safehouse,

38:22.467 --> 38:24.533
but he was already on his way
to carry out the attack.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.034
What were you selling him?
I don't know.

38:26.101 --> 38:27.268
What do you mean,
you don't know?

38:27.334 --> 38:28.533
I mean I don't know.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.800
It was a schematic.

38:29.867 --> 38:31.368
What kind of
a schematic?

38:31.433 --> 38:33.268
I'm paid to broker
the information,

38:33.334 --> 38:34.600
not dwell on the details.

38:34.667 --> 38:36.034
I make it my firm policy.

38:36.101 --> 38:38.101
You expect me to believe
that you acquired information

38:38.167 --> 38:40.400
for a terrorist group and you
didn't know the specifics?

38:40.467 --> 38:42.067
You can believe
whatever you want.

38:42.134 --> 38:44.433
The fact is, I got the
schematics from a source

38:44.500 --> 38:46.134
and they were
digitally encrypted.

38:46.201 --> 38:48.800
That source can tell you
what they mean.

38:48.867 --> 38:51.600
Give me immunity and
I'll give you my source.

38:51.667 --> 38:53.467
Those are my terms.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.767
You haven't offered us
very much.

38:58.834 --> 39:01.001
I'll see what I can do.

39:09.067 --> 39:10.567
( phone rings )
Buchanan.

39:10.634 --> 39:11.800
Yeah, it's Jack.

39:11.867 --> 39:14.500
She wants full immunity
signed by the president.

39:14.567 --> 39:16.201
She claims that she doesn't know
where Bierko is.

39:16.268 --> 39:18.867
That she just brokered a deal
for a set of schematics,

39:18.934 --> 39:20.101
and then delivered them.

39:20.167 --> 39:21.700
She doesn't know
what building they're for,

39:21.767 --> 39:23.934
but she can provide us with
the source of the schematics.

39:24.001 --> 39:25.334
She doesn't know
what she sold him?

39:25.400 --> 39:27.067
She said it was
digitally encrypted.

39:27.134 --> 39:28.734
Do you believe her?

39:28.800 --> 39:30.834
She's an independent contractor.

39:30.901 --> 39:31.967
In her line of work,
sometimes

39:32.034 --> 39:33.400
what you don't know
will save your life.

39:33.467 --> 39:34.800
Either way,

39:34.867 --> 39:36.533
if she's telling the truth,
we don't have a lot of time.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.533
She said Bierko already left
to set off his next attack.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.234
Miles, call Mike Novick,
let's get this started.

39:42.301 --> 39:43.533
Jack, this better work.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.600
And for the record,
I don't like it.

39:45.667 --> 39:47.101
We've paid a steep price.

39:47.167 --> 39:49.234
There'll be fallout
on the WET List.

39:49.301 --> 39:50.433
No, there won't be.

39:50.500 --> 39:51.934
The fallout will be from
German Intelligence.

39:52.001 --> 39:54.301
I programmed the memory card
to self-destruct.

39:54.368 --> 39:56.867
Why didn't you tell us this
before?

39:56.934 --> 39:58.767
I told you, I was in the car
with Stoller.

39:58.834 --> 40:02.433
Get back to me as soon as this
is done, we need to move fast.

40:05.700 --> 40:07.234
I think it's clear.

40:07.301 --> 40:08.967
CTU was hit,

40:09.034 --> 40:10.734
but we're still doing our job.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.201
I believe
that's an argument

40:12.268 --> 40:13.867
to maintain our autonomy.

40:13.934 --> 40:15.734
Well, I'll withhold
judgment on that.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.433
We're giving a free pass
to a terrorist collaborator,

40:18.500 --> 40:21.034
and I have yet to see
what we're getting from it.

41:01.934 --> 41:04.467
( tires screeching )

41:27.734 --> 41:29.767
( panting )

42:08.167 --> 42:12.001
Has the document been received
in Tripoli as well?

42:12.067 --> 42:14.201
And it meets with
your approval?

42:14.268 --> 42:15.500
So, there's no way

42:15.567 --> 42:19.234
that they can fail
to live up to the terms?

42:19.301 --> 42:22.368
Merci, Herve. Au revoir.

42:24.034 --> 42:25.500
The safehouse

42:25.567 --> 42:29.934
is a manufacturing facility
at 12451 Saticoy Boulevard.

42:30.001 --> 42:31.667
As for the data
I sold to Bierko,

42:31.734 --> 42:34.101
it's something that I
received from a contact

42:34.167 --> 42:35.433
at the Department
of Defense.

42:35.500 --> 42:36.400
What's his name?

42:36.467 --> 42:37.867
Her name.

42:37.934 --> 42:39.467
Audrey Raines.

42:41.167 --> 42:43.234
You are lying to me.

42:45.134 --> 42:47.600
She sold me the information, Mr.
Bauer.

42:47.667 --> 42:50.134
Apparently she had a price.

42:53.034 --> 42:54.268
Put her in the car.

42:54.600 --> 42:59.600
