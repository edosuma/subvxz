00:04.538 --> 00:05.739
Previously on ER:

00:05.773 --> 00:06.640
My parents were
in a car accident.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.509
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.744
Yeah, it happened in some
province north of Suzhou.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.581
Um, I'm pregnant.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.482
( crying )

00:14.515 --> 00:15.716
You did it.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.051
We have a baby.

00:17.085 --> 00:19.387
( no audio )

00:20.788 --> 00:22.656
It's nice to finally
meet you, Dr. Corday.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.593
I look forward to working
together again, soon.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.561
Excuse me. Can someone
get the door, please?

00:27.595 --> 00:29.797
( knocking on door )
Get me the hell out of here.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.065
Nice place.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.566
Yeah, it's okay.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.408
( woman groaning )

00:40.441 --> 00:42.476
( groaning, shivering )

00:43.777 --> 00:46.280
( grunting, panting )

00:49.750 --> 00:52.786
Oh, God...

00:52.820 --> 00:55.089
Nolan.

00:55.123 --> 00:58.826
Nolan, wake up. It's happening.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.761
( grunts )

01:00.794 --> 01:02.596
It's freezing.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.766
You turn the heat down?

01:05.799 --> 01:07.801
Nolan, get up.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.812
Rise and shine.
The baby's coming.

01:18.846 --> 01:22.316
We'll drop you at Gram's
on the way.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.784
Hello.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.819
Earth to children.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.855
You need to get dressed now.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.591
Clay, come on.
Get up, honey.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.160
Clay.

01:33.694 --> 01:34.795
Clay.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.165
Clay. Clay.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.466
Clay.

01:38.499 --> 01:41.402
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.504
Shannon? Shannon.

01:43.537 --> 01:46.340
( grunts ):
Shannon.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.576
Shannon.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.778
Nolan!

01:50.811 --> 01:52.580
( panting ):
Nolan!

01:52.613 --> 01:53.681
Nolan!

01:53.714 --> 01:55.183
( grunts )

01:55.216 --> 01:56.484
Nolan!

01:56.517 --> 01:58.186
Nolan, wake up.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.620
Nolan. Nolan.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.855
Nolan? Nolan!

03:01.014 --> 03:02.850
The alarm didn't go off.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.585
What?

03:04.618 --> 03:05.853
It's time for you to leave.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.521
What time is it?

03:07.555 --> 03:08.956
Time to get your butt
out of bed.
Hey!

03:08.989 --> 03:12.326
Shh! He might be up.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.828
I don't hear the TV.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.536
That's probably why
you should get going.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.538
Could I at least
get a shower?

03:24.572 --> 03:27.575
( giggling )

03:33.914 --> 03:37.017
Think I found a roach.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.552
No.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.721
Just an old raisin.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.523
Why are you up?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.292
Why are you?

03:44.325 --> 03:48.296
I'm going to that stupid
aquarium thing with Oscar.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.563
( TV playing )

03:49.597 --> 03:50.864
Alex?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.933
When are we going
to get satellite?

03:52.966 --> 03:55.736
Um...
( changing channels )

03:55.769 --> 03:58.439
we should probably talk.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.808
They have, like, a
thousand channels
or something.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.010
( changing channels )

04:04.945 --> 04:06.547
Oh.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.520
( clears throat )

04:12.553 --> 04:13.854
I took out T-bones
for dinner.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.923
Okay,
I'll bring the ketchup.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.459
Ah, over my dead body.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.961
Oh. What time
should I pick you up?

04:20.994 --> 04:23.063
Oh, that's okay.
I can take the El.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.632
Come on, baby.
It's icy out.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.600
I wouldn't want the little
Martin kid getting hurt.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.901
Don't do that.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.470
What?

04:29.503 --> 04:31.739
Make assumptions
about last names.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.342
Oh, little Petey then.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.644
Little Jenny?

04:36.677 --> 04:38.812
Until my name changes--
if it ever does--

04:38.846 --> 04:40.080
he or she is a Lewis.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.549
Okay, whatever you say, Mommy.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.783
Don't do that either.

04:42.816 --> 04:43.684
Okay, I've got to go. Bye.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.018
Okay, Bye.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.355
Oh, hey, when are you going
to introduce me

04:47.388 --> 04:49.623
to your old man?

04:49.657 --> 04:51.425
He knows about me, right?

04:54.027 --> 04:56.096
Did you tell him about the baby?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.665
Not yet.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.099
Don't you think you ought to...

04:59.132 --> 05:00.868
I gotta go. Bye.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.503
Bye.

05:02.536 --> 05:05.706
( distant sirens wailing )

05:05.739 --> 05:06.774
Hey.

05:06.807 --> 05:07.875
Morning.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.610
Am I late
or are you early?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.379
There's no point staying
in bed if you can't sleep.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.080
Oh, tell me about it.
Chuck snores.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.482
Either I need earplugs
or...

05:14.515 --> 05:15.749
Separate bedrooms.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.018
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.788
So, is this going to be a rush
or depress the hell out of me?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.055
The latter.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.524
It's multiples,
all from the same address.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.725
( woman sobbing )

05:24.758 --> 05:26.394
Vicki Bennett,
38 weeks pregnant,

05:26.394 --> 05:27.928
in active labor
and fully dilated.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.030
Why is this happening?
( grunting, sobbing )

05:30.063 --> 05:31.699
I'd say your baby
was ready.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.534
Breathe
through the contraction.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.002
Let's set up a BOA kit
and a fetal monitor.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.404
Okay, so, Mom's in labor.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.137
What's wrong
with everyone else?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.772
Unknown.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.040
Rest of the family was found
unconscious in their beds.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.675
Was the heat on?
It's 10 degrees out.

05:41.709 --> 05:42.710
What's the story?

05:42.743 --> 05:43.977
We have possible
CO poisoning.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.078
More family members coming in.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.481
HARMS:
Need some help here!

05:47.515 --> 05:49.049
Oh.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.918
How long
has he been seizing?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.119
Started as we pulled up.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.754
Altered mental status prior.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.723
No signs of head trauma.
Is he
on anticonvulsants?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.825
Not according to
his wife, and she's
the only one talking.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.959
Eight- and ten-year-old
are right behind me,

05:58.992 --> 06:00.528
out cold at the scene.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.995
What have we got?
Looks like relative hypoxia.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.931
I got this one,
you take the kids.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.433
Clay Bennett. Altered
but coming around in the rig.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.834
Complains of nausea,
vital signs normal.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.536
You feeling sick, dude?

06:08.569 --> 06:10.170
( vomiting )

06:10.203 --> 06:11.739
Right.
This one nauseous, too?

06:11.772 --> 06:13.173
Complains of headache,
good vitals.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.008
Okay, you take the boy.
I'll deal with the girl.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.177
What?
Hi. My name's Abby.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.012
We're going to try
to make you feel better, okay.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.548
( Vicki screaming )
She's crowning.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.949
Where's my family?

06:21.982 --> 06:23.684
They're being taken
care of, Vicki.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.019
Fetal heart rate's 105.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.555
I don't understand
what happened.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.889
Oh, we're not sure
what happened,

06:28.922 --> 06:30.524
but we need you
to stay here a while, okay?

06:30.558 --> 06:32.993
Okay, let's get Mom
on 100% O2 by mask.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.127
Labs?

06:34.161 --> 06:35.463
No one would wake up.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.530
Neela, labs. Now.

06:36.564 --> 06:37.798
CBC, type and Rh,

06:37.831 --> 06:39.733
UA and ABG with
carboxyhemoglobin level.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.669
When an entire family passes out
in winter,

06:41.702 --> 06:43.771
we assume
it's carbon monoxide poisoning.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.873
It can happen if your heater
doesn't vent properly.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.708
But I didn't pass out.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.977
The fetal hemoglobin has
a higher affinity for CO.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.579
( grunts ):
What?

06:51.612 --> 06:52.713
In English.
Sorry.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.482
Don't apologize. Just explain.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.484
The baby's blood latched
on to the carbon monoxide.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.751
That cleared it from your body

06:57.785 --> 06:59.520
and it kept you
from getting sick.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.490
Does that... does that mean
the baby got it all?

07:02.523 --> 07:03.891
Okay, big push
with the next one, Vicki.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.826
Here we go.
( Vicki screams )

07:05.859 --> 07:07.194
Stand by with
an umbilical line kit

07:07.227 --> 07:08.596
and a pediatric
intubation tray.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.797
Mr. Bennett? Mr. Bennett?

07:09.830 --> 07:11.064
All right, we need to get him

07:11.098 --> 07:13.066
on a non-rebreather
and draw an ABG.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.602
Neonatal laryngoscope?

07:14.635 --> 07:15.736
Bottom right.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.104
That's six of Ativan.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.739
Okay, push another two.
How's Mom?

07:18.772 --> 07:20.608
Lucky she was pregnant.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.510
Hey, Pratt, Morris
needs you in here.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.011
Yeah, well,
I'm a little busy here.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.613
Well, let me rephrase that:
his patient needs you.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.114
Go ahead. I got this.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.216
I want you to hang Dilantin
after eight of lorazepam.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.084
All right, keep
Dad's airway secure.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.586
What's the problem?

07:32.620 --> 07:33.854
He won't listen.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.188
I want my mommy.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.957
Yeah, yeah, hold on.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.125
Girl with a headache.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.793
Pulse ox 100%
on two liters.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.595
I don't have to draw
blood gas, do I?

07:41.629 --> 07:42.796
Yeah, you do.
I told you that.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.131
But her sats
are normal.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.966
Pulse ox measures oxygen
dissolved in the blood,

07:45.999 --> 07:47.601
not bound to hemoglobin.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.836
It's normal in CO poisoning.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.037
I told him that, too.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.072
Damn, who's the resident here?

07:52.105 --> 07:53.240
Ooh.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.142
You okay?

07:55.175 --> 07:57.545
Is my family dying?

08:11.792 --> 08:15.896
It just... it sort of
snuck up on us, you know?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.164
I mean, I don't...

08:17.197 --> 08:19.633
I don't think
either one of us planned it.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.901
Right?

08:20.934 --> 08:22.069
Right.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.775
It happens.

08:27.808 --> 08:28.976
People date.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.616
You okay back there?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.150
Yeah.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.820
You want to
talk about this?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.589
No.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.128
He's gonna start
breaking down muscle cells.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.830
Open up the fluids.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.699
Come on, man.
Enough is enough.
Dilantin's in.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.066
He keeps this up much longer,

08:53.100 --> 08:54.001
we're gonna get
irreversible brain damage.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.302
So, what do we do now?

08:55.335 --> 08:56.770
Start a drip
and hope it works.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.171
How fast should
I run it in?

08:58.205 --> 08:59.840
Wait. Wait.
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.676
Mr. Bennett, can you hear me?

09:02.710 --> 09:05.112
Carboxyhemoglobin 35%.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.146
He needs
the hyperbaric chamber.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.347
No, only if it's over 40.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.982
Or has significant
neurologic impairment.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.684
Yeah, but we don't
know that yet.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.352
Just keep him on oxygen.
We'll give him 30 minutes.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.121
If he doesn't wake up quick,
then we'll talk hyperbarics.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.656
( Vicki screams )

09:15.689 --> 09:18.626
Baby's distress
probably induced labor.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.160
It's a good thing, too.

09:20.193 --> 09:23.363
Otherwise they'd all
be dead right about now.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.699
Fetal heart rate's
down to 80.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.701
Why us?
Late decel.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.369
Okay, you really got to push
hard with this next one, Vicki.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.871
Here we go.

09:30.904 --> 09:31.705
( Vicki grunting )

09:31.739 --> 09:32.973
Good head of hair.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.041
Get ready
with a receiving blanket.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.342
What did we do?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.377
Okay, head's out.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.012
Bulb syringe.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.748
One more push, Vicki.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.716
( grunting )

09:42.750 --> 09:44.051
Okay.

09:44.084 --> 09:44.952
It's a boy.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.921
Clamp.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.090
We're good people.
We go to church.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.159
Okay,
hang in there, Vicki.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.694
Neela, deliver
the placenta.

09:53.727 --> 09:54.728
Me?

09:54.762 --> 09:55.829
Yes, you.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.330
How is he?

09:57.364 --> 09:59.166
CARTER:
Having a little
trouble breathing.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.901
LEWIS:
One for color,
one for tone.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.235
Zero for respirations.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.303
Something's wrong.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.337
What's wrong?

10:04.371 --> 10:05.873
Starting compressions.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.140
Uh, his heart's
not beating all that well

10:07.174 --> 10:08.842
because it's been deprived
of oxygen.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.879
What about the brain?

10:11.912 --> 10:13.714
( sobs ):
Oh, God.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.382
LEWIS:
I need to intubate.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.184
.3 of epi and draw an ABG.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.187
Let's find out how much
carbon monoxide he's taken in.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.422
Bad enough when residents
can't get in on time,

10:22.455 --> 10:24.057
but when attendings are late,

10:24.091 --> 10:26.259
it sends a message
that time is amorphous.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.228
7:00 a.m. is 7:00 a.m., people.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.930
And the minute Kovac gets here,
I want to talk to him.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.264
Yes, ma'am.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.767
Stop surfing the Web
on County time.

10:33.801 --> 10:34.935
Oh, Dr. Weaver?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.670
Fair warning:
Henry's colicky,

10:36.704 --> 10:38.405
Sandy's pulling a 24,
and I haven't had any coffee.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.940
What do you want?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.008
Placenta's out.

10:41.041 --> 10:41.975
LEWIS:
Neela, 20 of pit.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.410
VICKI:
Why isn't he crying?

10:43.443 --> 10:45.245
He's got a tube in his throat
to help give him oxygen.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.847
He's got a good
strong pulse, and
he's pinking up.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.115
Labs are back.
Just try to relax.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.917
And I will find out
how your family's doing.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.184
Mom's carbon monoxide's
in the safe range.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.385
She's 19%.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.854
LEWIS:
How's the
little hero?

10:53.887 --> 10:55.222
48.
Is that coma range?

10:55.255 --> 10:56.757
He needs hyperbaric therapy.
What's going on?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.025
LEWIS:
Your son has

10:58.058 --> 10:58.959
a very high level
of carbon monoxide

10:58.992 --> 11:00.060
in his body
that we need

11:00.093 --> 11:01.161
to clear out
very quickly.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.229
Kind of like
scuba diving.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.396
One way of
doing that is

11:03.430 --> 11:04.397
putting him in a big
pressure chamber.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.133
Take him down
to a pressure

11:06.166 --> 11:07.300
equivalent to 66 feet
of seawater;
he'll get three times

11:07.334 --> 11:08.769
as much oxygen.
Will he wake up then?

11:08.802 --> 11:10.738
That's our hope.
Can I hold him?

11:10.771 --> 11:11.972
Uh, yeah, you
can touch him,

11:12.005 --> 11:13.106
but the sooner
we start treatment,

11:13.140 --> 11:14.775
the better
the result.

11:14.808 --> 11:15.909
Oh.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.979
Oh, he's... he's beautiful.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.881
Yeah, he is.
Okay, sorry, Vicki,
we got to go.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.750
We're going
to do everything we can.
Neela?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.852
( crying )

11:24.885 --> 11:26.887
Take this.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.090
( sobbing )

11:30.123 --> 11:31.424
You did a NICU rotation, right?

11:31.458 --> 11:32.425
I need you in the chamber
with him.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.827
Oh, wait.
You're sending me?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.062
Yeah. A nurse
will be with you.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.363
They're waiting
for you upstairs.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.065
I thought an attending
should be going with me.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.166
No. A dive takes too long.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.001
Well, how long?
A couple of hours.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.169
Is that a problem?

11:48.441 --> 11:49.242
Okay.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.778
Here you go.

11:50.811 --> 11:51.879
Take off your gown.
Put on these booties, okay?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.080
No lipstick, no makeup,

11:53.113 --> 11:54.214
hair spray, nail polish,
perfume.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.783
What?
They're all flammable.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.084
Okay, remove any
watches, jewelry,

11:57.117 --> 11:58.418
electronic equipment.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.519
Do you have any
unfinished root canals,

11:59.552 --> 12:00.520
temporary fillings, caps?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.155
Uh, no. Why?

12:02.189 --> 12:03.490
Okay, trapped air
in the tooth socket can expand.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.125
Do you know how
to clear your ears?

12:05.158 --> 12:06.359
I don't think
I can do this.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.928
All right,
just pinch your nostrils,

12:07.961 --> 12:09.529
blow against the closed glottis.
Let's go.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.398
No. I can't
go in there.
What, are you claustrophobic?

12:11.431 --> 12:13.033
Is there time to
get a replacement?

12:13.066 --> 12:15.202
What do you think?
Come on.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.811
All right, hook
him up to the vent.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.445
I'll set the clock.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.349
Patient and attendants set?

12:29.382 --> 12:31.051
Go for it.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.285
You're not going to
panic on me, are you?

12:34.221 --> 12:35.823
Initiating pressurization.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.124
( high-pitched motor whirring )

12:37.157 --> 12:38.926
Does this stay this loud?

12:38.959 --> 12:40.828
You get used to it.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.529
( panting )

12:42.562 --> 12:44.464
I'm sorry.
Can we stop now?

12:48.335 --> 12:49.469
Ten feet.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.838
Uh, do we have a problem
in there?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.072
My ear's bothering me.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.306
Take us up two feet.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.143
Hold your nose,
blow to equalize.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.444
( sighs )

12:57.477 --> 13:00.513
I'm sorry. Please,
can we stop now?

13:00.547 --> 13:02.315
Resume pressurization.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.851
( panting )

13:11.224 --> 13:12.960
You should really be
on the postpartum floor.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.261
Mommy!

13:14.294 --> 13:16.096
It's all right, honey.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.397
Mommy's here now.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.432
Everything's going
to be fine.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.235
You're not doing them any favors
by not taking care of yourself.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.403
How is he?

13:23.436 --> 13:25.138
He's a little groggy.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.406
You just had a baby.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.375
If I can't be
with my baby,

13:28.408 --> 13:29.977
I want to be
with them.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.079
Vitals q 30 minutes,

13:32.112 --> 13:33.346
CBC in two hours.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.547
Mom's good and cranky.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.016
How's Dad?

13:36.049 --> 13:37.284
Just woke up.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.618
Neuro exam is nonfocal.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.420
Oriented to person,
place and time.

13:40.453 --> 13:44.257
Could still have long-term
neuro-psychological deficits.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.592
She know that yet?

13:45.625 --> 13:47.427
Ah, no. She doesn't need to.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.896
The girl's
headache subsided.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.397
LEWIS:
Yeah, and, uh,
how's the boy?

13:50.430 --> 13:51.631
He's hungry,
wants a snack,

13:51.664 --> 13:53.300
but he's worried
about Mom and Dad.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.401
Yeah, me, too.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.502
Any word on the baby?

13:55.535 --> 13:56.436
In the chamber.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.905
What's his pOH2?

13:57.938 --> 13:59.306
He has a name.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.275
Samuel.

14:02.309 --> 14:05.012
Can you make sure
whoever's with him knows that?

14:05.045 --> 14:06.914
Of course.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.449
What's the verdict?

14:09.482 --> 14:10.650
Oh, four hours
at 100%,

14:10.683 --> 14:12.252
they should
all be clear.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.453
The baby's
another story.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.022
Yeah.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.924
So, how are you doing
with your pregnancy?

14:16.957 --> 14:18.125
Oh, yeah.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.426
Fine. You
know, tired.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.527
A little scared.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.929
About having one?

14:21.962 --> 14:25.598
About what happens
after you do.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.941
Every winter,
it's the same thing.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.442
Is there any sort
of air conditioning?

14:35.475 --> 14:36.609
Temperatures
go down,

14:36.643 --> 14:37.945
heaters get
turned up,

14:37.945 --> 14:39.446
people
asphyxiate.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.014
I mean, why does it have
to be so bloody hot in here?

14:41.048 --> 14:42.349
Well, when
pressure rises

14:42.382 --> 14:43.383
in a fixed
volume,

14:43.416 --> 14:44.451
it's going
to get warm.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.652
Ideal gas law.

14:45.685 --> 14:46.686
PV equals NRT.
What about it?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.288
Okay.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.556
Time to give the kid
an air break.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.358
It prevents
oxygen toxicity.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.625
I can hardly breathe.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.460
Well, too much,
and he could seize.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.461
How much longer?

14:54.494 --> 14:56.063
Uh, hour, 40.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.097
( rapping on window ):
Neela?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.131
Yeah?

14:58.165 --> 14:59.166
His name's Samuel.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.500
Sorry?

15:00.533 --> 15:03.470
The baby.
The mom wanted you to know.

15:03.503 --> 15:04.504
How are you doing?

15:04.537 --> 15:06.006
Fine.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.207
Okay, good.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.976
I'll see you
in a couple hours.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.477
( panting )

15:10.510 --> 15:12.212
CORDAY:
Kerry,

15:12.245 --> 15:14.447
I examined Mrs. Krall,
and she won't require surgery.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.616
She passed her kidney stone
half an hour ago.

15:16.649 --> 15:19.552
She wants to turn it
into a brooch.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.221
I'm sorry. What?

15:21.254 --> 15:22.622
Okay, let me guess.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.525
Henry has colic,
and you're barely sleeping.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.294
Yeah. Did Ella
have it, too?

15:27.327 --> 15:28.428
Terrible teething.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.297
It's no cakewalk now, though.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.731
Uh, tantrums,

15:31.764 --> 15:34.534
a constant demand for toys,
refusing to eat.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.170
I hate to say it,
but, uh, in some ways,

15:37.204 --> 15:38.571
it gets harder.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.473
Yeah, must be twice
as hard by yourself.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.675
You have any
prospects?

15:43.610 --> 15:46.446
Uh...

15:46.479 --> 15:48.281
I met a teacher recently.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.549
He's a nice man.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.251
Nice is good.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.221
Yes, it's nice.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.457
Okay, open up.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.227
All right,
there you go.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.361
Oh, with a minute
to spare.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.362
That's me,

16:02.395 --> 16:03.430
punctual.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.597
Dad says she
has strep.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.099
Later.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.335
It's been going
around her school.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.469
Okay, let's see.

16:09.502 --> 16:10.537
Ooh.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.339
101.7.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.107
You have a fever, young lady.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.409
Anything else,
stuffy nose?

16:16.443 --> 16:18.578
No, it's just
my throat.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.713
Okay, let's have a look.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.550
Oh.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.118
Looks pretty red.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.087
A doctor's going to want
to take a culture.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.056
How long's that going to take?

16:29.056 --> 16:30.557
Oh, waiting room's
pretty packed.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.092
Six to eight hours.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.593
Look, I just started
a new job...

16:33.626 --> 16:35.162
It'll be
okay, Daddy.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.596
Why don't you two take a seat,

16:36.629 --> 16:38.565
and we'll call you back
as soon as we can?

16:38.598 --> 16:40.300
Okay, thanks.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.771
You think
Alex is okay?

16:44.804 --> 16:46.806
Uh, I don't know.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.342
Maybe you should
bring him to my
place tonight.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.710
We can talk more,

16:50.743 --> 16:52.179
watch something
on the big screen.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.346
I'm not sure.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.547
I'll cook.

16:54.581 --> 16:55.582
WOMAN:
This where I sign in?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.084
Uh-huh.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.318
Can we talk about this later?

16:58.351 --> 16:59.652
'Cause I need
to get back to work.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.254
How can I help you
today, ma'am?

17:01.288 --> 17:02.589
WEAVER:
Kovac.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.257
Morning, Kerry.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.258
Guess I should
be grateful

17:05.291 --> 17:06.693
it's not afternoon.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.528
You're late, which makes me late
for a budget meeting.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.597
Look for the deduction
in your paycheck.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.732
Could be worse.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.666
She could have
an M16 strapped on.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.103
What's this?

17:16.103 --> 17:17.170
Oh, place across
the street

17:17.204 --> 17:18.838
does dry ice
shipments.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.640
It's a prenatal
care package for Kem,

17:20.673 --> 17:23.143
plus some stuff that they,
uh, need at the clinic.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.411
Sus-phrine,
terbutaline...

17:24.444 --> 17:25.712
Yeah, I hear
they're really desperate

17:25.744 --> 17:28.281
for roses in the Congo.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.582
How long has it been?

17:29.616 --> 17:30.683
Since we've seen each other?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.685
34 days.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.122
16 hours,

17:35.122 --> 17:36.556
12 minutes.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.658
But we E-mail each other.

17:38.691 --> 17:42.595
She says she's really
starting to show.

17:42.629 --> 17:43.630
All right.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.165
See you later.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.835
Would you hand me a tissue?

17:48.868 --> 17:51.171
He really misses her.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.205
( sirens wailing )

17:52.239 --> 17:54.174
Married 36 years.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.643
He gave my mom flowers
every anniversary.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.578
Swore he loved her
till the day she died.

17:58.611 --> 17:59.879
That sounds sweet.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.881
'Course he loved his
girlfriends, too.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.583
( sirens wailing )
They just had you
and your sister?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.152
Yeah. Both raised
by crazy people.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.486
Couldn't have turned out
more differently.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.754
MAN ( muffled ):
Let go of me.

18:07.787 --> 18:08.788
I guess they did
the best they could.

18:08.821 --> 18:09.822
Yeah. That's the scary part.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.191
20-something John Doe,

18:11.224 --> 18:12.325
found down behind a building.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.361
Just let go of me, please.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.628
Where is all this blood
coming from--

18:15.662 --> 18:16.596
GSW, knife wounds?

18:16.629 --> 18:17.764
None that we found,

18:17.797 --> 18:18.698
but he wouldn't exactly
let us check.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.167
Fistfight maybe?

18:20.167 --> 18:21.501
The other guy won.
Just let me go, please!

18:21.534 --> 18:22.569
Altered and agitated.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.471
Tachycardic at 128,
BP: 160/92.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.373
Got to be
on something heavy-duty.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.574
( grunts )

18:27.607 --> 18:30.243
I hate your guts!

18:31.211 --> 18:32.279
66-year-old male,

18:32.312 --> 18:33.346
acute shortness
of breath,

18:33.380 --> 18:35.182
febrile, sats 94%.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.716
I'm on my way out. Sorry.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.585
Bed-bound secondary
to a pelvic fracture.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.319
Deb?

18:39.352 --> 18:40.653
Hey, Carter.

18:40.687 --> 18:41.854
Hey, how are you?
When did you get back?

18:41.888 --> 18:43.656
Last week. I
couldn't leave China

18:43.690 --> 18:45.758
until my father
was stable enough
for transport.

18:45.792 --> 18:46.893
I'm sorry to hear
about your mom.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.461
Yeah, she had
a fatal PE,

18:48.495 --> 18:50.197
and now my dad's
got pneumonia.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.664
Been taking care
of him at home.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.200
With nursing care?

18:53.233 --> 18:54.434
No. He doesn't want
anyone else

18:54.467 --> 18:55.668
in the house.
It's been hard.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.437
Hey, Deb.
Deb, how are you?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.506
Hey, Jerry.
Hi.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.740
Hey, Dr. C,
good to see you.

19:00.773 --> 19:01.941
Hey, Malik.
Are you all right?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.443
Yeah.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.612
Hey, Dr. Chen.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.415
Okay.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.417
Sorry. What's the problem again?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.685
My grandson is
coughing too much.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.521
I need to see Dr. Weaver.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.357
Uh... she's not in.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.560
My daughter said
to have her check him.

19:20.593 --> 19:21.928
Ma'am, he'll be seen
by a doctor,

19:21.961 --> 19:23.630
but I can't guarantee you
which one.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.233
( speaking Spanish )

19:26.233 --> 19:27.467
Mira,

19:27.500 --> 19:29.469
Sandy and Dr. Weaver--

19:29.502 --> 19:31.771
they live together.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.376
Oh.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.377
It's evil!

19:37.410 --> 19:38.478
You hear me?!

19:38.511 --> 19:40.413
Found a meth pipe.

19:40.447 --> 19:41.881
Want to guess what
the tox screen's
going to say?

19:41.914 --> 19:43.716
Uh, still do a full workup.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.485
He could just as easily
be that way from a head bleed.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.553
It's everywhere.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.720
It's everywhere!

19:47.754 --> 19:48.755
You want hard
restraints?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.490
Try Ativan first.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.791
No free fluid.

19:51.824 --> 19:52.825
Morrison's is clear.

19:52.859 --> 19:53.926
No signs of trauma.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.562
Where's the wound?
LEWIS:
What?

19:55.595 --> 19:56.729
I can't finding anything.

19:56.763 --> 19:57.697
Nothing, not a scratch.

19:57.730 --> 19:58.898
It's demons!

19:58.931 --> 20:00.967
It's demons all around us.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.669
Hematocrit's normal.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.870
So, he's not
bleeding

20:03.903 --> 20:05.472
internally
or externally.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.340
Let's hope he works
at a meat-packing plant.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.008
GALLANT:
Hey, Dr. Lewis,
you got a minute?

20:09.041 --> 20:10.443
Yeah, uh.
You know what?

20:10.477 --> 20:12.479
Call the cops in
case he doesn't.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.513
What's up?

20:13.546 --> 20:14.781
Nancy Natarelli, 42,

20:14.814 --> 20:16.015
with nausea,
vomiting
and fatigue

20:16.048 --> 20:17.517
times two weeks.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.951
She's afebrile,
normal vitals,

20:18.985 --> 20:22.789
lungs clear, abdomen soft,
uh, no CVA tenderness.

20:22.822 --> 20:26.726
Her meds include kali phos
and, uh, arsenicum.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.362
Homeopathic
stuff.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.997
Oh, I got five
kids at home.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.732
I can't be sick
like this.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.967
That's a lot
of diapers.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.003
Who are you telling?

20:37.036 --> 20:39.706
Had three of my own already.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.375
These five are theirs.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.677
You're pretty young
to be a grandma.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.882
You think it's the side effects
from the Saint John's Wort?

20:49.916 --> 20:51.584
It's probably just
a stomach virus,

20:51.618 --> 20:53.453
but we'll run some
tests to make sure.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.554
So, why are
you taking it?

20:54.587 --> 20:55.755
Are you depressed?

20:57.357 --> 20:59.859
Just thought I'd be done
raising kids by now.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.994
Okay, we'll be back.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.566
CBC, chem panel, UA?

21:06.599 --> 21:07.700
Could be pyelo.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.536
Uh, yeah,
and run a psych history,

21:09.569 --> 21:11.571
and make sure
she's not clinically depressed.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.773
All right.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.575
Dad's coming around.
Okay.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.076
He's okay.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.778
All right, Vicki, you need
to get back to your bed

21:18.811 --> 21:20.613
and put your mask on.

21:20.647 --> 21:21.848
He's talking
and everything.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.650
That goes for you, too.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.354
How are you feeling,
Mr. Bennett?

21:27.387 --> 21:28.588
Headache.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.557
What happened?

21:30.590 --> 21:31.958
Uh, do you know what today is?

21:31.991 --> 21:34.494
Wednesday?

21:34.527 --> 21:35.595
Vicki said that

21:35.628 --> 21:37.697
the baby saved our lives.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.765
Uh, yeah.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.600
He did.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.769
Is he going to be okay?

21:52.679 --> 21:54.781
( breathing shallowly )

21:54.814 --> 21:56.749
You're not making it go
any faster staring at it.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.851
Why do they have to make
these chambers so small?

21:58.885 --> 22:00.119
Been in smaller.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.988
Hey, we're over
halfway there, okay?

22:02.021 --> 22:03.089
Relax.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.624
Please, don't say that.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.958
You have no idea
how hard this is for me.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.394
You want Valium?
What?

22:07.427 --> 22:08.561
Calm your nerves.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.029
No, I just...

22:10.062 --> 22:11.764
I need to get out of here.
Wait a minute.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.466
He's stable now.
He'll be fine.
I know, but just...

22:13.500 --> 22:14.801
If I don't get out of here,

22:14.834 --> 22:16.536
I'm going to lose it.
Do you understand?

22:16.569 --> 22:17.870
Uh, problems?

22:17.904 --> 22:19.739
I'm stepping into the air lock.
Bring me up.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.408
Well, are we okay with this?

22:21.441 --> 22:23.676
Yeah. Get Dr. Olivera
to take her place.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.144
( panting )

22:25.177 --> 22:26.546
Yeah, lucky for you, it's easier

22:26.579 --> 22:27.714
going up than going down.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.115
Hurry, please.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.617
Ascending.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.851
( alarm beeping )

22:34.587 --> 22:36.556
Tachycardia,
heart rate's 180.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.824
Is the other doctor en route?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.091
Yeah, I paged him.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.127
Breath sounds decreased
on the left.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.795
P waves, not SVT.

22:42.829 --> 22:44.897
He's got a
pneumothorax.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.165
Uh, 40 feet.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.700
Do you need a surgeon in there?

22:47.734 --> 22:49.436
No, we need to
reinflate his lung.

22:49.469 --> 22:50.770
( alarms beeping )
Pulse is weak and thready.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.171
( sighs )

22:52.204 --> 22:53.840
Bring me back down.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.008
Descending.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.177
Open the crash cart
and prep the chest.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.946
PVCs. Are you coming back in?

22:59.979 --> 23:01.814
Just until
the other doctor arrives.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.817
60 feet.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.453
Ow!

23:07.186 --> 23:08.488
My ear...

23:08.521 --> 23:10.457
It's bleeding.

23:10.457 --> 23:11.558
You perfed your eardrum.

23:11.591 --> 23:12.492
Don't worry. It grows back.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.493
Come on.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.895
We're at depth.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.965
( panting heavily )

23:21.200 --> 23:24.136
( panting loudly )

23:26.105 --> 23:29.141
He's got a subtle
right middle lobe infiltrate.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.911
Sure makes me appreciate
our healthcare system.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.714
Had to wait a week for
a chest film in Suzhou.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.783
Low-grade fever.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.751
It's probably just
early pneumonia.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.587
Or pulmonary embolus.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.522
Can he get a VQ scan?

23:42.555 --> 23:43.590
Doesn't need one.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.724
D-dimer's negative.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.660
He's low probability for PE.

23:47.694 --> 23:51.698
Does he, uh, walk at all?

23:51.731 --> 23:54.567
He can, but he won't,

23:54.601 --> 23:56.636
and I can't make him.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.606
Since his surgery,
he's been depressed,

23:59.639 --> 24:01.608
a bit demented.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.709
Hmm.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.712
Just stares at the TV.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.114
So, what happened?

24:12.051 --> 24:15.522
They skidded off some back road
in the middle of nowhere.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.890
Car flipped.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.760
My mom never
regained consciousness.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.833
Jing Mei?

24:26.866 --> 24:29.235
I'll let you two
get caught up.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.870
Thank you, John.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.143
What's going on?

24:37.176 --> 24:40.012
Um, I'm having my dad
checked for PE.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.714
When did you
get back?

24:41.748 --> 24:44.817
Um, last Monday.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.553
You should have called.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.557
How are you,
Mr. Chen?

24:52.191 --> 24:54.561
( speaking Mandarin )

25:01.300 --> 25:04.837
( speaking Mandarin )

25:04.871 --> 25:07.073
Ah.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.580
Maybe the ET tube's
just down too far.

25:13.580 --> 25:14.847
No, with tracheal shift,
it's a tension pneumo.

25:14.881 --> 25:15.848
Give me a 22 gauge.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.650
Are you all right in there?

25:17.684 --> 25:19.586
Alcohol wipe.
Are you sure that
you're up for this?

25:19.619 --> 25:20.853
Where the hell is Dr. Olivera?

25:20.887 --> 25:22.154
Coming in.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.290
Finally.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.633
There.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.101
How's the heart rate?

25:35.134 --> 25:37.136
( alarms beeping )
Back down
to 128.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.304
He needs a chest tube.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.106
You start.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.675
I'll get there
as soon as I can.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.911
Five centimeters of water
on the thoraseal.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.081
Perfect.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.316
LEWIS:
Sleeping like a baby now.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.218
No sense
in keeping him in here.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.153
Pupils are four
millimeters,

25:54.186 --> 25:55.622
equal and reactive,

25:55.655 --> 25:57.223
and he has
beautiful irises.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.658
Can you move this guy
to Sutures?

25:58.691 --> 25:59.759
Sure thing.

25:59.792 --> 26:00.993
Yeah, just wait
till he comes to,

26:01.027 --> 26:03.129
and realizes
we took his crystal meth pipe.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.664
Won't be so cute then.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.198
And Malik,
you have a standing order

26:06.232 --> 26:07.166
for five of Haldol.

26:07.199 --> 26:08.200
You got it.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.769
Thanks.

26:09.802 --> 26:10.870
You think he'll be
able to tell us

26:10.903 --> 26:12.004
what happened to him?

26:12.038 --> 26:13.806
Doubt he'll remember.

26:13.840 --> 26:14.974
It's sad.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.042
What?

26:16.075 --> 26:18.344
He's somebody's kid.

26:18.377 --> 26:21.080
Morris, I got a call
that my son was here?

26:21.113 --> 26:22.281
Yeah, he's
in Curtain One.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.684
He's really cute.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.318
Florina?

26:26.352 --> 26:28.120
He just wouldn't
stop coughing.

26:28.154 --> 26:29.321
Hi, baby.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.757
Handsome boy, Kerry.

26:30.790 --> 26:31.791
Thanks.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.225
He's eating okay.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.360
But he was very
uncomfortable.

26:34.393 --> 26:35.795
I checked his ears.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.163
They are fine,
and lungs are clear.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.230
Belly's soft.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.732
It's probably just a cold.

26:39.766 --> 26:40.867
Come here, baby.
Come here.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.034
Go with Mama.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.770
Yeah, yeah.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.805
I appreciate
you keeping them company.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.074
Right. Uh, nice to meet you.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.308
Pleasure.

26:49.341 --> 26:52.278
He was a very
helpful man.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.146
All right, Grandma needs
to get you home.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.115
There's too many germs
in this place.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.884
Just, uh, keep
the humidifier on.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.385
Mm-hmm, okay.

26:59.418 --> 27:02.054
And-and give him some Tylenol
if he gets fussy.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.122
But what you really need

27:03.155 --> 27:04.857
is some sleep, sweetie.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.158
Yes.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.327
Will you be home late
again tonight?

27:08.360 --> 27:10.029
Probably not.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.864
He yours, Dr. Weaver?

27:11.898 --> 27:14.400
Yup, all 16
pounds of him.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.235
Oh, sweet.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.170
There's my...

27:18.204 --> 27:19.906
There's my guy...

27:19.939 --> 27:23.175
Severa, how much morphine
did you give Dolly Zuzich?

27:23.209 --> 27:26.713
12 milligrams.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.748
Hey, you seen
that little girl's father?

27:28.781 --> 27:31.183
She's not with them?

27:31.217 --> 27:32.952
No. Came in with her dad.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.121
Hmm.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.894
Christy, where's your dad?

27:41.928 --> 27:43.730
Um, he's coming
right back.

27:43.763 --> 27:44.864
When?

27:44.897 --> 27:46.132
After work.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.801
He just leave you here?

27:48.835 --> 27:50.803
I'm okay.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.404
Come on.
Let's get you inside.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.746
15 blade,
fifth intercostal.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.413
Hate doing procedures
on infants.

28:01.447 --> 28:02.915
Getting more
tachycardic.

28:02.949 --> 28:05.117
20 seconds.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.919
Kelly.
Stay superior to the rib.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.254
What? You'll have to speak up.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.356
Into this pleura.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.991
Keep your pinky
in the tract

28:12.024 --> 28:13.159
so you don't lose it.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.994
Inserting tube.
Trachea's midline.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.162
I can't thread it in.
I can't see.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.229
Wipe my brow.
What?

28:17.263 --> 28:18.998
Wipe my brow!

28:19.031 --> 28:19.999
( sighs )

28:20.032 --> 28:21.167
We're equalized.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.301
I'm here.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.469
I'm in.

28:23.502 --> 28:24.771
3-0 silk.

28:24.771 --> 28:28.040
Okay.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.976
Heart rate's
down to 110.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.245
( exhales )

28:33.279 --> 28:34.914
Hi, Dad. It's me.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.048
Hey, I put that Foley
in Babe Grunhard.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.249
You owe me.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.951
Oh, yeah, could you
get 40 of prednisone

28:38.985 --> 28:40.787
to Peenie
Sudar in Two?

28:40.820 --> 28:43.422
No, uh, me, Susan.
Your daughter?

28:43.455 --> 28:44.857
Uh, what's up?

28:44.891 --> 28:46.025
Well, you know,
not much.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.794
I was just calling
to check in.

28:47.794 --> 28:49.195
( whispers ):
Tell him.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.329
NOLAN:
Excuse me, Doctor?

28:50.362 --> 28:51.463
Um, Dad, you
know what?

28:51.497 --> 28:53.165
I'm sorry. I
have to go. Bye.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.500
You should
be in bed.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.803
We want to know
about the baby.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.470
I will go check
right now.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.072
Here, why don't you come
back inside with your family?

29:00.106 --> 29:01.373
Hey, Dr. Lewis?
Yes.

29:01.407 --> 29:02.441
Nancy Natarelli's
test results.

29:02.474 --> 29:03.409
Oh, young grandma?

29:03.442 --> 29:04.811
Yup. Now I know why

29:04.811 --> 29:06.112
she was more
tired than usual.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.379
Positive ICON.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.480
So, you want me
to tell her?

29:08.514 --> 29:09.816
Uh, oh...
There she is.

29:09.849 --> 29:10.817
That's okay.
I'll do it.

29:10.850 --> 29:11.951
Can you do me a favor?

29:11.984 --> 29:13.052
Call the chamber
and find out

29:13.085 --> 29:14.286
how that baby's doing, okay?

29:14.320 --> 29:15.454
Okay.

29:15.487 --> 29:16.455
Nancy?

29:16.488 --> 29:17.456
Oh, hi.

29:17.489 --> 29:18.457
Hi.

29:18.490 --> 29:19.926
Is something wrong?

29:19.959 --> 29:21.293
Um, well, that depends.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.129
You're pregnant.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.530
No, I-I can't be.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.332
I-I'm on the pill.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.201
Unfortunately, Saint John's Wort
can make oral contraceptives

29:29.235 --> 29:31.270
ineffective.

29:31.303 --> 29:34.273
Oh, my God.

29:34.306 --> 29:35.307
I'm pregnant?

29:35.341 --> 29:36.475
OLBES:
Coming through.

29:36.508 --> 29:37.476
Um, yeah.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.278
You know, I'm sorry.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.312
Dr. Gallant can answer

29:40.346 --> 29:41.280
any questions you have.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.849
I'll be right back, okay?

29:42.882 --> 29:44.250
Clara Waskowitz, 50s,
multiple stab wounds

29:44.283 --> 29:45.517
to the neck,
chest and abdomen.

29:45.551 --> 29:46.485
Don't hurt him.
How much blood loss?

29:46.518 --> 29:47.586
Scene was covered in it.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.855
BP's 78 over palp, no sats.

29:48.888 --> 29:49.856
It was the drugs...

29:49.889 --> 29:50.957
Her lung's down.
What's open?

29:50.990 --> 29:52.291
This happen
on the street?

29:52.324 --> 29:53.392
Nothing.
Housekeeping's
backed up.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.927
Husband's in
the next rig.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.328
Come on.
Let's go.
But it wasn't his fault...

29:56.362 --> 29:57.396
Multiple stab wounds
to the torso.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.297
At least as many as the wife.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.099
Hard to tell who's worse.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.268
Whoever did this
must have been
really pissed off.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.402
Is it broken?

30:03.435 --> 30:05.337
Yup. That's
what happens

30:05.371 --> 30:07.606
when you hit someone
with your fist.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.541
( coughs ):
Spare some
change?

30:09.575 --> 30:11.177
Get a job, dude.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.045
What do you think
you're doing?

30:13.079 --> 30:14.546
Oh.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.616
How about you,
sweet stuff?

30:17.649 --> 30:18.985
Feed the poor?

30:19.018 --> 30:20.219
Leave her alone,

30:20.252 --> 30:21.988
and get back
to your bed, okay?

30:22.021 --> 30:24.356
I'm not talking to you.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.391
I am talking to...

30:25.424 --> 30:26.893
( loud hacking cough )

30:26.926 --> 30:28.594
Get back to your bed.
Damn it.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.963
Sweetie.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.264
He spit on me.

30:32.298 --> 30:35.334
You're okay.
You're okay, honey.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.269
We'll get you something else
to wear, okay?

30:37.303 --> 30:38.304
Let's put her
in a gown.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.872
Where are her parents?

30:39.906 --> 30:41.340
Dad left her in Triage,
had to go to work.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.342
I brought her back here,
thought she'd be safer.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.377
Okay, let's do one better
and find her a room.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.513
Good deal.

30:49.415 --> 30:52.251
Hey, uh, I never
got an answer.

30:52.284 --> 30:53.585
About?

30:53.619 --> 30:56.255
Well, some pasta, wine,
a little X-Box for Alex.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.457
Uh, I don't think
tonight'll work.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.226
Tomorrow night then?

31:04.030 --> 31:05.397
Actually, I was thinking

31:05.431 --> 31:08.334
it might be a good time
to take a break.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.969
What?

31:10.002 --> 31:12.071
You know, just take it slower.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.006
You know what I'm saying?

31:14.040 --> 31:15.474
Uh, no.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.077
No, I don't.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.078
( sighs )

31:19.111 --> 31:20.379
We're not exclusive, right?

31:20.412 --> 31:22.681
We're just, like,
dating or whatever.

31:22.714 --> 31:27.186
No commitments, no strings,
no co-parenting, just...

31:27.219 --> 31:28.520
Keep it casual, okay?

31:28.554 --> 31:31.057
Okay.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.959
DUVATA:
Sam, Dr. Kovac...

31:34.426 --> 31:36.562
Double trauma.
We need more hands.

31:39.431 --> 31:40.466
LEWIS:
She's out.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.201
Come on, Clara.
Open your eyes.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.536
I can't get the line.
I'll do it.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.704
Forget the drugs.
Let's tube her.

31:45.737 --> 31:46.973
BP's dropping.

31:46.973 --> 31:47.673
54 systolic.

31:47.706 --> 31:49.208
Suction on high.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.311
Need another set of hands
for this neck bleeder.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.646
Bradying down. 53.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.016
Three through the wall wounds
to the right side alone.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.018
Gee, haven't seen this much
blood since this morning.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.087
More cricoid.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.989
You think the speed freak
had something to do with it?

32:02.989 --> 32:06.158
Who knows? 30-French
and curved kelly.

32:06.192 --> 32:07.726
Can you see the cords?

32:07.759 --> 32:10.029
Throat was slashed,
but it didn't touch the trachea.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.363
I'm in.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.033
Me, too.
Mig of atropine.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.602
TAGGART:
Left lung is up.

32:16.635 --> 32:17.536
He was pretty bloody.

32:17.569 --> 32:18.737
LEWIS:
Who?

32:18.770 --> 32:21.573
Meth pipe boy,
and he was hallucinating.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.176
LEWIS:
Laceration to
the left axilla.

32:24.210 --> 32:25.277
( alarm beeping )
V-fib.

32:25.311 --> 32:26.312
Paddles.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.346
Charge to 200.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.714
Stabbing victim, right?

32:28.747 --> 32:30.116
She a surgical candidate?

32:30.149 --> 32:32.251
Uh, not a very good one.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.620
Clear.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.022
Still V-fib.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.156
The husband's next
door. Try him.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.490
Charge to 300.

32:38.524 --> 32:41.127
Clear.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.029
Ten stab wounds,
mainly abdominal.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.031
Still hypotensive. 64/48.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.666
Hang another two
on the rapid infuser.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.335
Home invasion,
robbery gone bad?

32:49.368 --> 32:50.669
Gotta be more personal
than that.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.471
CORDAY:
Where are you?

32:52.504 --> 32:54.373
He's got free fluid in the
belly with hypotension.

32:54.406 --> 32:55.607
Urine dips negative
for heme.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.143
Cops said their house
was broken into.

32:57.176 --> 32:58.577
Doesn't mean they
don't know who did it.

32:58.610 --> 32:59.711
Good breath sounds.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.047
Red line for a open laparotomy.

33:01.080 --> 33:05.417
Hang two grams of cefotetan.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.486
How come there are
only men in here?

33:07.519 --> 33:09.055
Ectopy.

33:09.055 --> 33:11.057
Probably ischemia
from the hypotension.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.358
Let's do a subclavian.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.093
And keep the
blood pouring in.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.528
LEWIS:
Clear.

33:16.562 --> 33:17.729
Asystole.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.065
It's been 40 minutes.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.300
And eight units of O neg.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.534
I guess that's it, Clara.

33:22.568 --> 33:25.337
Time of death: 10:54.

33:28.707 --> 33:31.210
Hope this wasn't evidence.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.478
( man shouting )

33:32.511 --> 33:34.713
Look. I guess it was related.

33:34.746 --> 33:38.350
MAN:
I didn't do anything!

33:38.384 --> 33:40.086
( panting ):
No. Let me go!

33:40.086 --> 33:41.120
Let go!

33:41.153 --> 33:42.588
Look, I didn't do anything.

33:42.621 --> 33:46.125
I didn't know them!

33:46.158 --> 33:47.693
Hey, so, what's the story?

33:47.726 --> 33:49.761
Kid went nuts,
stabbed his parents.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.264
Killed one of 'em, right?

33:55.434 --> 33:57.369
Starting to ascend.

33:57.403 --> 33:58.704
Thank God.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.372
You did great.

34:00.406 --> 34:03.142
More like Samuel survived
despite me.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.744
No, seriously,
you did great.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.113
You okay?

34:07.113 --> 34:08.746
Feeling a little funny.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.416
Are you having
chest pain?

34:10.449 --> 34:11.417
A bit.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.119
Abort ascent.

34:13.119 --> 34:15.554
NEELA:
What? No.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.556
There's crepitance
and subq emphysema.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.425
Probably blew out a few
air sacs on the way up.
Oh, no.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.759
Look, if we ascend
too rapidly,

34:20.792 --> 34:22.360
we could collapse a lung.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.429
So we'd better do
an hourlong decompression.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.364
Another hour?

34:27.599 --> 34:29.301
How long will he be under?

34:29.335 --> 34:30.469
At least four hours.
Maybe more if we
get into the chest.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.304
Make the next two
units type specific.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.172
Excuse me, but we need
to get his statement
as soon as possible.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.474
The man's been
stabbed 11 times.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.143
Let him survive surgery first.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.614
Hello.

34:42.648 --> 34:43.849
Hello.

34:47.386 --> 34:50.522
So, what brings you to the ER?

34:50.556 --> 34:51.857
Transcatheter embolization

34:51.889 --> 34:55.460
of pulmonary arteriovenous
malformation.

34:55.494 --> 34:58.497
That's quite a mouthful.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.367
And you?

35:01.400 --> 35:02.368
Uh, stabbing victim.

35:02.401 --> 35:04.236
Lacerated liver
and spleen,

35:04.270 --> 35:08.907
open laparotomy, thoracoscopy
and probable pericardiectomy.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.543
Push the Medical Executive
Session until next week,

35:11.577 --> 35:13.612
and tell Anspaugh
to contact me

35:13.645 --> 35:14.846
before scheduling meetings

35:14.880 --> 35:17.183
I'm expected to attend.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.821
You think you'd like
to go out sometime?

35:22.854 --> 35:25.391
Sure.

35:25.424 --> 35:28.327
Good.

35:29.695 --> 35:30.862
I'll call.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.664
Yeah, you do that.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.837
I thought you were
dating a teacher.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.873
I am.

35:41.907 --> 35:44.910
No, prostate cancer
with back pain and leg weakness

35:44.943 --> 35:46.345
cannot wait a day for an MRI.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.879
Sign here and here.

35:47.913 --> 35:50.249
Yeah, well, you know what?
We're short-staffed, too.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.283
Dr. Lewis?

35:51.317 --> 35:53.252
You got Chuck on line one.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.753
You know what, tell him
I'll call him back.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.288
Okay, you know what,
you have five minutes

35:56.322 --> 35:59.591
to hire someone because
I'm sending this guy up.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.659
Rough day?

36:00.692 --> 36:01.893
Just typical.

36:01.927 --> 36:03.395
Mom's staring at the clock.

36:03.429 --> 36:04.596
You were supposed to find out
about the baby?

36:04.630 --> 36:05.897
Oh, crap.

36:05.931 --> 36:06.865
How long ago was it?

36:06.898 --> 36:08.534
Two hours.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.336
Oh, you know what, just
tell them I'm pregnant.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.870
Maybe they'll cut
me some slack,

36:11.903 --> 36:16.575
and I'll have someone bring
Mom down to the chamber.

36:16.608 --> 36:19.278
Yeah, I'll get a wheelchair
and take her myself.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.279
You almost done?

36:20.312 --> 36:21.813
Need to check labs.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.283
Uh, can you, actually, use
one of the other terminal?

36:24.316 --> 36:25.751
What are you doing
over here anyway?

36:25.784 --> 36:27.419
None of your beeswax.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.688
Dawnie Dinovo's asking for
a new albuterol prescription.

36:29.721 --> 36:30.956
Labs are back
on our orphan.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.558
Positive for strep.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.826
We can't treat her
without parental consent.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.829
What's wrong?

36:37.863 --> 36:39.831
I'm okay.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.967
Well, you seem kind of...

36:42.000 --> 36:44.703
Don't read into things.

36:44.736 --> 36:46.572
Excuse me?

36:46.605 --> 36:48.840
Hey, Mr. Grover, you're back.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.709
Where's my daughter?

36:50.742 --> 36:52.678
Isn't it your job to know?

36:52.711 --> 36:54.780
Sorry?

36:54.813 --> 36:56.548
Dr. Kovac examined Christy.

36:56.582 --> 36:57.883
She has strep throat.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.485
But worse than that,

36:59.518 --> 37:01.653
she's been traumatized
by being left alone here.

37:01.687 --> 37:02.921
What happened?

37:02.954 --> 37:03.989
Is she okay?
She's fine.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.023
No, she's not.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.325
There are drunks here.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.693
Junkies, psych patients.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.928
Yeah, and doctors
and security guards and nurses.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.730
She's ten.

37:11.763 --> 37:14.300
She could have wandered away,
been abducted, assaulted.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.734
Luka.
What?

37:15.767 --> 37:17.769
He abandoned her.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.405
I'm a single dad, okay?

37:19.438 --> 37:21.740
I gotta feed my kid,
so I gotta go to work.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.375
What am I supposed to do
when it takes six hours

37:23.409 --> 37:24.776
to get her seen
by a doctor?

37:24.810 --> 37:25.811
CHRISTY:
Daddy?

37:25.844 --> 37:27.646
Honey, are you okay?

37:27.679 --> 37:29.448
Did anybody bother you?

37:29.481 --> 37:31.483
Give her 250 of Pen VK.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.756
He responded well
to the therapy.

37:37.789 --> 37:38.990
Oh, my God.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.727
It's okay.
It looks worse than it is.

37:43.629 --> 37:44.730
Are they ready yet?

37:44.763 --> 37:46.732
Yeah, they just came out.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.768
Hey. Is this Mom?

37:49.801 --> 37:51.370
Yeah, can she see him?

37:51.403 --> 37:52.638
Yeah. He can see her.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.341
He opened his eyes
a few minutes ago.

37:58.377 --> 38:01.079
Hi, Samuel.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.714
It's Mommy.

38:02.748 --> 38:05.717
Spontaneous movement.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.586
He'll need another round
of treatment tomorrow,

38:07.619 --> 38:10.722
but he looks good.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.658
When can he go home?

38:12.691 --> 38:14.560
Probably in three days.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.595
He'll need to be in the NICU
overnight for observation,

38:16.628 --> 38:17.996
and you'll be in OB.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.598
( laughs )

38:21.767 --> 38:24.770
We didn't plan
on having a third.

38:24.803 --> 38:28.540
But thank God
he came along.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.118
Neela!

38:40.151 --> 38:41.787
What are you still
doing in there?

38:41.820 --> 38:45.557
Possible pneumomediastinum,
among other things.

38:45.591 --> 38:48.594
You should've had someone
replace you.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.403
Thanks, Sharon.

38:57.403 --> 38:58.537
Hey.
Hey.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.006
Bye.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.009
How was the aquarium?

39:04.042 --> 39:04.910
See any sharks?

39:04.943 --> 39:05.811
Yup.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.746
Listen, I was thinking

39:07.779 --> 39:09.681
maybe you and me
could do something
by ourselves tonight.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.116
I mean, we haven't
really had the chance

39:11.149 --> 39:12.684
to talk about things.

39:12.718 --> 39:15.887
Like you and Luka
having sex?

39:15.921 --> 39:18.724
Well, that wasn't how
I was going to put it,

39:18.757 --> 39:20.526
but yeah, that.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.794
What's there
to talk about?

39:22.828 --> 39:24.796
I don't know,
how you feel.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.798
Whether or not it
hurts your feelings

39:26.832 --> 39:30.869
or pisses you off
or whatever.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.038
I'm fine.

39:45.116 --> 39:45.884
Hey, how's the baby?

39:45.917 --> 39:46.918
Oh, great.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.186
How's the rest
of the family?

39:48.219 --> 39:49.821
Just finishing
disp orders on Dad

39:49.855 --> 39:50.856
and the other kids now.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.691
Oh, man.

39:52.724 --> 39:53.759
What a hell of a day.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.193
It's not even lunch yet.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.028
Only got half
a shift to go.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.531
Since when did you become
so optimistic?
Recently.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.967
Dr. Carter,
come have a look.

40:03.201 --> 40:04.836
( woman coughs on computer )

40:04.870 --> 40:05.871
Kem?

40:05.904 --> 40:07.873
John, is that you?

40:07.906 --> 40:09.741
Oh, my...! Yeah.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.176
Oh, my God.
How did you do this?

40:11.209 --> 40:14.646
I found out the
consulate had a webcam.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.848
Oh, you look great.
How are you?

40:16.882 --> 40:20.018
She can hear me?
Yeah.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.687
See for yourself.

40:23.689 --> 40:24.956
( Carter laughs )

40:24.990 --> 40:26.725
What do you think?

40:26.758 --> 40:28.727
How come some women
have little volleyball tummies

40:28.760 --> 40:30.161
when they're pregnant...

40:30.195 --> 40:32.631
Wow.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.099
...and others don't?

40:34.132 --> 40:36.635
I felt a kick yesterday.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.103
Really?

40:38.136 --> 40:40.739
High-speed MVA with
multiple fractures.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.140
Oh, I got it.

40:43.074 --> 40:45.711
What do you think?

40:47.746 --> 40:51.517
I think you're both beautiful.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.623
You get the VQ results?

40:57.656 --> 41:00.759
Normal, negative Dopplers
on the legs.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.260
So, no PE.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.029
That's good.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.664
Well, he still needs
to be admitted for pneumonia.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.899
Get him on IV antibiotics.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.735
Yeah, but you knew
that was gonna happen.

41:09.768 --> 41:12.203
It's common at his age.

41:12.237 --> 41:17.175
Least you're amongst
friends here.

41:17.208 --> 41:20.178
So, how long you going
to do this?

41:20.211 --> 41:22.881
Take care of him 24/7?

41:22.914 --> 41:25.216
Because, you know,
there are assisted
living situations.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.853
My father's going to get better.

41:27.886 --> 41:31.256
Jing-Mei.

41:36.962 --> 41:44.035
I was at the hotel, asleep,
when my mother died.

41:44.069 --> 41:47.272
She was all alone.

41:55.881 --> 41:57.148
Breathe.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.650
Your breath sounds are equal.

41:58.684 --> 41:59.951
( panting ):
I told you I'm fine.

41:59.985 --> 42:00.986
I'm sure you are,
but once we're out,

42:01.019 --> 42:02.087
you'll need a chest x-ray.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.288
How much longer?

42:03.321 --> 42:05.123
Three feet and rising.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.125
Come on. Come on.

42:07.158 --> 42:09.795
If it is pneumomediastinum,
it'll resolve on its own.

42:09.828 --> 42:10.829
Excuse me.

42:10.862 --> 42:11.830
NURSE:
Wait, wait!

42:11.863 --> 42:13.298
Wait!

42:16.267 --> 42:18.937
( panting )

42:19.838 --> 42:22.107
Out of the way, please!

42:25.844 --> 42:29.047
Excuse me.

42:30.348 --> 42:31.950
( Malik yells )
Watch yourself.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.619
What the hell?

42:36.187 --> 42:38.957
( panting )

42:42.928 --> 42:46.665

42:46.698 --> 42:48.333
Regular here?

42:48.366 --> 42:50.301
Uh, yeah, every Tuesday
with his buddies.

42:50.335 --> 42:51.670
Black Hawks fan?

42:51.703 --> 42:53.805

Don't ask.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.007
Hi, Dad.

42:56.041 --> 42:57.342

42:57.375 --> 42:59.845
Ordered you a beer.

43:01.747 --> 43:04.082
Um, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

43:04.115 --> 43:05.684
Oh, he's nuts.

43:05.717 --> 43:08.319
That was not
a cross check.

43:10.956 --> 43:12.057

43:12.090 --> 43:13.091

Yeah.

43:23.134 --> 43:25.170
You two had dinner yet?

43:29.440 --> 43:31.376
I'm gonna have a baby,
and Chuck's the father.

43:31.409 --> 43:34.212
You're gonna be a grandpa.

43:34.245 --> 43:37.115
They couldn't score a goal
to save their lives.

43:39.117 --> 43:40.852
You marrying her?

43:40.886 --> 43:43.254
If she'll have me.
