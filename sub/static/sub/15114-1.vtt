Harris:
<i>It's called Lewy Body.</i>

00:03.440 --> 00:06.742
<i>Degenerative progression</i>
<i>is slow, irreversible,</i>

00:06.744 --> 00:08.943
<i>and there is no known cure.</i>

00:08.946 --> 00:11.414
Dr. Harris, I'm a reporter.

00:11.416 --> 00:13.182
I think there may be
<i>some information here</i>

00:13.184 --> 00:15.918
<i>that could be of serious</i>
<i>interest to the public.</i>

00:15.920 --> 00:18.553
I'm here to discuss
your relocation.

00:18.555 --> 00:20.188
<i>This is not a request.</i>

00:20.190 --> 00:21.589
I want you
to run for governor

00:21.591 --> 00:23.958
<i>against Mac Cullen</i>
<i>in the primary.</i>

00:23.960 --> 00:26.293
Ben, primaries are four days away.
Are you focusing?

00:26.295 --> 00:28.562
I am, on you.
I need to see you.

00:28.564 --> 00:33.399
Man: <i>We are projecting</i>
<i>a win for Ben Zajac.</i>

00:33.401 --> 00:35.968
We won!

00:35.970 --> 00:38.238
Kane has changed.
We don't act now,

00:38.240 --> 00:41.441
we may lose the opportunity of
both our political lifetimes.

00:41.443 --> 00:42.710
Change is in the air.

00:42.712 --> 00:44.745
<i>We have to</i>
<i>realign ourselves.</i>

00:44.747 --> 00:46.114
Do you have what it takes?

00:46.116 --> 00:48.416
I want names.
Who?!

00:48.418 --> 00:50.886
Tom: <i>Every person who has</i>
<i>plotted against me</i>

00:50.888 --> 00:53.922
<i>will feel the force</i>
<i>of my wrath.</i>

00:53.924 --> 00:57.025
<i>No one will be</i>
<i>left unscathed.</i>

00:57.027 --> 01:00.096
- <i>Police!</i>
- Tom: <i>Why did you do it?</i>

01:00.098 --> 01:02.932
The only end that matters
to you now is you.

01:02.934 --> 01:05.001
I can't abide by that.

01:05.003 --> 01:07.870
- Tom: <i>What would</i> <i>you advise I do now...</i>
- <i>( Gunshot )</i>

01:07.872 --> 01:10.572
<i>...given I know</i>
<i>what you've done?</i>

01:10.574 --> 01:13.509
You will have to choose
where you stand.

01:13.511 --> 01:17.279
<i>It will be up to you</i>
<i>to prove your commitment.</i>

01:17.281 --> 01:19.148

Harris: <i>It's an acute
acceleration</i> <i>of the disease--</i>

02:41.537 --> 02:45.039
<i>muscle rigidity,</i>
<i>whole-body tremors.</i>

02:45.041 --> 02:47.508
<i>These are hallmarks.</i>

02:47.510 --> 02:49.210
Tom:
<i>So it wasn't a seizure?</i>

02:49.212 --> 02:51.945
Harris: <i>If there wasn't a lack</i>
<i>of consciousness, no.</i>

02:54.583 --> 02:57.551
<i>It's progressing.</i>

02:57.553 --> 02:59.620
<i>Faster than expected.</i>

03:03.759 --> 03:06.994
<i>I'm assuming you haven't been</i>
<i>taking antipsychotics.</i>

03:11.266 --> 03:13.668
Hallucinations
have been minimal.

03:13.670 --> 03:16.704
There's an awareness.

03:16.706 --> 03:19.073
I can cope.

03:19.075 --> 03:21.843
<i>Not inclined to make physical</i>
<i>matters worse than they are.</i>

03:21.845 --> 03:25.514
It was shortsighted of me
to think I could manage

03:25.516 --> 03:27.783
without monitoring,
calibration.

03:27.785 --> 03:29.217
Trust was an issue.

03:29.219 --> 03:31.419
Sam Miller--

03:31.421 --> 03:33.287
what did you say to him?

03:33.289 --> 03:36.057
I--

03:36.059 --> 03:38.293
nothing.

03:38.295 --> 03:40.161
Couldn't have said much in
a call of less than a minute.

03:40.163 --> 03:44.766
I was attacked, threatened,
made to move.

03:44.768 --> 03:48.070
He is no longer a part
of the equation,

03:48.072 --> 03:50.639
the purveyor
of those actions.

03:50.641 --> 03:53.208
<i>I didn't realize</i>
<i>what he was capable of.</i>

03:54.677 --> 03:58.847
You must miss them--
your friends, your family.

03:58.849 --> 04:01.350
<i>Can't have been easy</i>

04:01.352 --> 04:04.453
<i>to start over</i>
<i>for either of you.</i>

04:04.455 --> 04:08.925
There is a school--
good, private,

04:08.927 --> 04:12.596
and specific in terms of

04:12.598 --> 04:16.800
your son's
academic struggles.

04:16.802 --> 04:18.869
Enrollment can be secured.

04:18.870 --> 04:21.473
<i>And I understand</i> <i>there's an
opening</i> <i>in neurology at Lindner.</i>

04:21.475 --> 04:24.609
I have to get back.
Work to do.

04:24.611 --> 04:27.479
The tremors can be
suppressed for a time,

04:27.481 --> 04:28.814
but without neuroleptics--

04:28.816 --> 04:30.949
Awareness.
Force of will.

04:30.951 --> 04:32.951
You're not God.

04:32.953 --> 04:36.755
You don't want to shake?
How do you feel about seeing monsters

04:36.757 --> 04:39.391
or believing you can fly?

04:39.393 --> 04:42.160
Your personality,
your judgment,

04:42.162 --> 04:43.662
the way you
look at the world--

04:43.664 --> 04:46.865
all those things
will be compromised.

04:46.867 --> 04:48.800
Soon.

04:50.336 --> 04:53.873
Purpose.
I have purpose.

04:55.442 --> 04:58.277
Mr. Mayor,
you have to know

04:58.279 --> 05:01.113
your best days
are behind you.

05:45.792 --> 05:48.527
Driver:
<i>Mr. Stone was a good man.</i>

05:55.836 --> 05:58.004
It's what you leave behind.

06:07.382 --> 06:08.849
<i>( Door opens )</i>

06:08.851 --> 06:11.418
Sweetheart.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.828
- That happened during your arrest?
- No.

06:25.967 --> 06:27.434
What do you want?

06:31.506 --> 06:33.306
I bear no responsibility,

06:33.308 --> 06:37.243
having not been made aware
of this plan, this maneuver.

06:37.245 --> 06:41.214
Blame, if it must be placed,
lies with your father,

06:41.216 --> 06:45.652
a man who is willing to sacrifice
that which is most precious

06:45.654 --> 06:47.888
for his political survival.

06:50.291 --> 06:52.326
It's the life
he chose, Mom.

06:56.598 --> 06:59.266
What is it exactly,
his illness?

06:59.268 --> 07:01.336
<i>Oh, come on, Emma.</i>

07:01.338 --> 07:04.739
You don't owe him anything,
least of all protection.

07:07.242 --> 07:09.977
I don't understand

07:09.979 --> 07:13.413
why it's come to this,

07:13.415 --> 07:16.049
why you are
the way you are.

07:16.051 --> 07:19.519
The men, the drugs.

07:22.657 --> 07:24.557
Look at you.

07:24.559 --> 07:26.092
<i>You used to be good,</i>

07:26.094 --> 07:29.930
a smart girl
with a future.

07:37.039 --> 07:41.843
It's called Lewy Body.
He has three to five years.

07:45.180 --> 07:47.782
What's your future
look like?

07:55.591 --> 07:58.392
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, Rick.

07:58.394 --> 08:01.262
- Yo, it's been two weeks, man. You need to do something.
- Hey, hey, hey!

08:01.264 --> 08:03.364
Get the fuck off me.
I'm just trying to talk to him.

08:03.366 --> 08:06.033
- You need to do something. Get the fuck off me.
- It's all right.

08:06.035 --> 08:08.035
- Settle down.
- It's all right. Let him go.

08:08.037 --> 08:10.304
<i>If this young man</i> <i>has something
to say</i> <i>to me, I should hear it.</i>

08:10.306 --> 08:12.973
It's all right.
Give him some space. Come on.

08:12.975 --> 08:16.209
Thank you, Rick.

08:16.211 --> 08:17.978
You got to get her out.

08:17.980 --> 08:21.147
Sadly the Department of Corrections
is outside my purview.

08:21.149 --> 08:22.749
Man, bullshit.

08:22.751 --> 08:25.418
Your purview
put her there, man.

08:25.420 --> 08:27.688
What kind of man
does that?

08:27.690 --> 08:29.289
Sends his own daughter
to jail--

08:29.291 --> 08:32.460
Don't you fucking dare
to judge my actions.

08:32.462 --> 08:36.397
If I hadn't pissed in the faces of
federal agents preempting their raid,

08:36.399 --> 08:39.732
she'd be stuck in Joliet's
general population right now.

08:39.735 --> 08:42.770
The fact that she is where she
is at all isn't because of me.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.839
It's because of a piece-of-shit
drug dealer like you.

08:47.475 --> 08:49.610
I've heard what
you had to say.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.611
I'll take it under consideration.
Remember to vote.

08:51.613 --> 08:53.313
Man, if you don't
get her out, I swear--

08:53.315 --> 08:54.647
You'll do what?

08:54.649 --> 08:57.383
The only thing
that's believable about you

08:57.385 --> 09:00.153
is that you have
the unmitigated stupidity

09:00.155 --> 09:03.123
to threaten
the mayor of Chicago.

09:11.866 --> 09:13.600
You okay, sir?

09:13.602 --> 09:16.002
He won't be pulling
a lever for me.

09:16.004 --> 09:19.372
- Don't bother with a report.
- Okay.

09:19.374 --> 09:22.174
Ian: <i>CNN and Fox are both covering</i>
<i>the groundbreaking ceremony.</i>

09:22.176 --> 09:23.909
<i>We've got national feeds</i>
<i>to the three nets,</i>

09:23.911 --> 09:26.345
<i>state and local affiliates,</i>
<i>confirmed print pubs,</i>

09:26.347 --> 09:28.781
<i>"New York Times,"</i> <i>"Washington
Post,"</i> <i>"USA Today,"</i>

09:28.783 --> 09:31.383
the "Wall Street Journal,"
the "Sentinel."

09:31.385 --> 09:33.585
I'm assuming you saw the
editorial on the ordinance.

09:33.587 --> 09:35.487
Poaching real estate
from the Housing Authority

09:35.489 --> 09:37.523
to line the pockets
of his fat-cat friends

09:37.525 --> 09:38.958
all in the name
of urban renewal.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.359
Would you like me
to un-invite--

09:40.361 --> 09:42.528
22 goddamn years
to stick a single shovel

09:42.530 --> 09:44.597
in the ground
for the O'Hare expansion.

09:44.599 --> 09:48.234
That's an abuse of power, all the
obstructionists on the city council.

09:48.236 --> 09:49.735
Fuck the "Sentinel."

09:49.737 --> 09:51.537
And why am I talking
to a goddamn temp?

09:51.539 --> 09:53.539
- I...
- How long are you on loan for?

09:53.541 --> 09:56.108
Another few weeks.
Though Alderman Driscoll being a woman

09:56.110 --> 09:58.511
does provide a loophole if it
was a gentleman's agreement.

10:00.514 --> 10:02.548
As far as the Housing
Authority ordinance,

10:02.550 --> 10:04.884
we're on track
for the vote tomorrow.

10:04.886 --> 10:07.654
A request for postponement was denied
and you have a solid majority in place.

10:07.656 --> 10:09.322
In terms of Ezra Stone's
replacement,

10:09.324 --> 10:10.958
we've received
several CVs.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.626
Who?

10:12.628 --> 10:15.162
Advisor from Congressman Wexer's office.
Chief of staff from--

10:15.164 --> 10:18.365
Who requested
the postponement?

10:20.101 --> 10:22.002
Ross:
<i>Want anything?</i>

10:22.004 --> 10:23.904
I'm fine.

10:23.906 --> 10:27.240
- <i>I think I have some juice.</i>
- I'm not staying.

10:27.242 --> 10:29.376
<i>Never mind.</i>
<i>No juice.</i>

10:34.215 --> 10:35.415
Sit.

10:42.290 --> 10:43.857
Sorry to bother
you at home,

10:43.859 --> 10:46.526
but the vote is scheduled
for tomorrow.

10:46.528 --> 10:48.227
Which?

10:49.830 --> 10:51.231
Lennox Gardens.

10:53.067 --> 10:55.468
This isn't one
we can lose.

10:55.470 --> 11:00.240
You'd be surprised
what you can live without.

11:03.310 --> 11:06.612
Quinn, Costigan, and Kowalski
all have concerns

11:06.614 --> 11:09.749
about gang activity spilling into
their wards if the Gardens come down.

11:11.485 --> 11:14.054
<i>If we promise support</i>
<i>on the transit ordinance</i>

11:14.056 --> 11:16.623
<i>coming up next month,</i>
<i>I think we can swing them.</i>

11:16.625 --> 11:19.359
Mm-hmm.

11:19.361 --> 11:22.662
Even with that
and our caucus voting

11:22.664 --> 11:25.998
in a block,
it would be tight.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.235
You know I'm grateful,
don't you?

11:29.237 --> 11:32.771
- <i>Sir.</i>
- <i>It's important to me</i>

11:32.773 --> 11:34.840
that you know
how much you are

11:34.842 --> 11:35.875
<i>valued.</i>

11:39.212 --> 11:43.515
3,200 units--
mothers, children,

11:43.517 --> 11:46.185
extended families,
friends,

11:46.187 --> 11:49.221
not to mention 10,000
registered voters

11:49.223 --> 11:51.990
making the Gardens a
substantial part of your base.

11:51.992 --> 11:53.258
You know why I hired you?

11:53.260 --> 11:56.995
Because you have
an impressive mind.

11:56.997 --> 11:59.998
This isn't just
a housing project.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.201
<i>Allowing Kane</i>
<i>unchecked control</i>

12:03.203 --> 12:05.203
will devastate
an entire community.

12:05.205 --> 12:08.607
It's your concern
that I find

12:08.609 --> 12:11.444
most attractive.

12:11.446 --> 12:13.012
( Sighs )

12:14.781 --> 12:16.715
Thanks for
taking the time.

12:16.717 --> 12:18.917
I'll do what I can.

12:20.954 --> 12:22.855
Mona.

12:25.058 --> 12:27.726
Get up off the mat...

12:27.728 --> 12:29.629
sir.

13:42.204 --> 13:44.939
Mrs. Kane.
Hi. Ian Todd.

13:44.941 --> 13:48.409
I've been assisting
your husband since, well...

13:48.411 --> 13:50.578
Pleasure to meet you.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.914
I've long been an admirer
of Chicago's First Lady.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.716
Excuse me.

13:54.718 --> 13:56.250
If you'll just
give me a moment,

13:56.252 --> 13:58.653
I'd like to make sure the mayor is
not in the middle of something.

13:58.655 --> 14:00.654
( Chuckles )

14:00.656 --> 14:02.590
I hardly think it's
your place to determine

14:02.592 --> 14:05.426
when I can or cannot
see my husband.

14:05.428 --> 14:08.096
Wouldn't you agree?

14:08.098 --> 14:09.998
Yes, ma'am.

14:12.334 --> 14:14.536
There's more than
one oversight.

14:17.706 --> 14:19.407
Sitting Sudar
next to Lawson.

14:19.409 --> 14:21.208
Amateur.

14:21.210 --> 14:24.211
I'm sure you're feeling the
loss of both Ezra and Kitty.

14:24.213 --> 14:26.981
And I suspect you're trying
to manage everything yourself.

14:26.983 --> 14:29.584
But despite what is
no doubt a valiant effort,

14:29.586 --> 14:32.253
you can't do it alone.

14:32.255 --> 14:35.089
Things are falling
through the cracks.

14:35.091 --> 14:38.692
I've made the appropriate
changes to the seating chart.

14:38.694 --> 14:41.495
Perhaps now a clash
of the titans

14:41.497 --> 14:43.096
<i>can be avoided</i>
<i>at the ceremony.</i>

14:43.098 --> 14:46.166
Titans, my ass.

14:46.168 --> 14:48.469
Parasites, all of them.

14:51.039 --> 14:53.574
Thank you.

14:53.576 --> 14:55.309
I saw Emma.

14:57.746 --> 14:59.413
How is she?

14:59.415 --> 15:01.649
Angry.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.818
Holding up.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.920
I'm trying to arrange
for a release.

15:05.922 --> 15:07.822
State's attorney is being
a real prick about it.

15:10.225 --> 15:12.659
Did she tell you
about me?

15:19.935 --> 15:22.003
What's our plan, Tom?

15:22.005 --> 15:24.807
( Chuckles )

15:24.809 --> 15:27.777
Murder, robbery,

15:27.779 --> 15:33.382
the selling of drugs,
rape--

15:33.384 --> 15:37.954
<i>if you've been convicted</i>
<i>of these crimes,</i>

15:37.956 --> 15:40.056
- <i>( applause )</i>
- Reporter: <i>A new</i> statewide poll suggests

15:40.058 --> 15:42.525
<i>Senator Walsh has gained</i>
<i>ground with this message.</i>

15:42.527 --> 15:44.861
Walsh is getting traction
with this anti-felon thing.

15:44.863 --> 15:48.632
Apparently she's raised over
three million this quarter.

15:48.634 --> 15:51.402
Disclosure smoke
and mirrors.

15:51.404 --> 15:53.404
The bill's never
gonna pass anyway.

15:53.406 --> 15:56.908
Kane wouldn't let anything
touch Cook County voter rolls.

15:56.910 --> 15:59.878
<i>Have you talked to him?</i>

15:59.880 --> 16:03.615
- That doesn't strike you as odd?
- Not really.

16:04.884 --> 16:07.118
I mean, when was
the last time he called you

16:07.120 --> 16:09.520
or you had a coordinated
public appearance with him?

16:09.522 --> 16:12.456
Maggie, I'm giving the introduction
at the O'Hare ceremony.

16:12.458 --> 16:15.927
But when was the last time you
got any real press coverage?

16:15.929 --> 16:17.729
The kind Walsh
is getting now?

16:17.731 --> 16:20.598
<i>When is he gonna infuse some</i>
<i>money into your war chest?</i>

16:26.039 --> 16:28.039
Don't worry.

16:29.709 --> 16:31.109
The money'll come.

16:34.047 --> 16:36.315
Three million, Ben.

16:40.020 --> 16:41.420
<i>( Shower running )</i>

17:00.808 --> 17:02.208
( phone vibrating )

17:04.912 --> 17:07.314
- <i>( shower running )</i>
- Hey, it's me.

17:07.316 --> 17:10.983
Um, where the hell
have you been?

17:10.986 --> 17:13.819
Uh, I need you

17:13.821 --> 17:15.488
for the campaign,

17:15.490 --> 17:18.891
so call me.

17:18.893 --> 17:20.059
( Chimes )

17:24.730 --> 17:26.664
<i>( knocking )</i>

17:26.665 --> 17:29.767
- Woman: <i>Do you</i> want anything?
- I'm okay, Mom.

17:29.769 --> 17:32.703
<i>You're not eating</i>
<i>near enough.</i>

17:32.705 --> 17:36.107
I'm not hungry.

17:36.109 --> 17:38.776
- Ballsy editorial, man.
- ( Cheering )

17:38.778 --> 17:40.812
- All right.
- All right!

17:40.814 --> 17:43.681
Okay, enough.
Enough already.

17:43.683 --> 17:46.084
Four articles, emailed
to you late last night,

17:46.086 --> 17:48.286
hard copies on your desk
since 6:00 this morning.

17:48.288 --> 17:51.155
- Can I get approval, please?
- Yeah, I looked them over.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.224
It's pretty
bite-sized stuff, Jackie.

17:53.226 --> 17:55.993
You only gave me
five column inches.

17:55.995 --> 17:57.995
I know, but-- whatever.

17:57.997 --> 17:59.797
Just let me give them
a quick polish.

17:59.799 --> 18:02.033
Dr. Harris,
you track her down yet?

18:02.035 --> 18:04.869
No. No referrals on
the disconnected number.

18:04.871 --> 18:06.970
And before you ask,
yes, I did follow up

18:06.972 --> 18:08.839
with the police
on Stone's murder.

18:08.841 --> 18:11.107
While they have no leads, there
have been a few burglaries

18:11.109 --> 18:12.776
in the Near North area
where he lived.

18:12.778 --> 18:15.645
Come on.

18:15.647 --> 18:17.247
Just so we're clear,

18:17.249 --> 18:20.150
you're gonna take a pass at my
articles and I'm free to move on?

18:20.152 --> 18:24.021
To a piece on how much this O'Hare
extravaganza is costing the taxpayers.

18:24.023 --> 18:26.223
As opposed to covering
the actual news?

18:26.225 --> 18:28.459
If you can't find the doctor,
find Kitty O'Neill.

18:28.461 --> 18:30.127
She was a no-show
at Stone's funeral.

18:32.031 --> 18:34.566
I'm just gonna say it.
No one cares, Sam.

18:34.568 --> 18:36.568
No one cares
and no one reads.

18:36.570 --> 18:38.570
They skim.
They click on links.

18:38.572 --> 18:40.137
They watch.

18:40.139 --> 18:42.573
What they don't do
is cozy up to a 10-page

18:42.575 --> 18:45.909
bullshit conspiracy theory
investigative piece on the mayor.

18:45.911 --> 18:48.278
They know he's corrupt.
They don't give a shit!

18:48.280 --> 18:52.281
Jackie, I'm not enjoying
the insubordination.

18:52.283 --> 18:54.316
Do your job.

18:55.818 --> 18:59.354
You are a fucking despot.

19:03.092 --> 19:06.528
City of "I will."

19:06.530 --> 19:09.598
I will.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.501
City of "I will."

19:13.837 --> 19:15.571
Always preferred
that city motto

19:15.573 --> 19:18.741
to the one about it
being a garden.

19:18.743 --> 19:20.743
Don't do that.

19:20.745 --> 19:23.813
- Sir?
- Don't interrupt me with attempts at relevance.

19:25.682 --> 19:27.583
Leadership of the Progressive
and Latino Caucuses

19:27.585 --> 19:30.119
- are ready for you downstairs.
- Did you get me a name?

19:30.121 --> 19:33.655
The request for a vote postponement
came from Alderman Ross' office,

19:33.657 --> 19:36.057
his senior advisor
Mona Fredricks.

19:36.059 --> 19:38.360
I'll need
a new whip count.

19:38.362 --> 19:40.262
Something else I shouldn't
have to tell you.

19:42.231 --> 19:44.533
Perhaps now isn't the time,
but I also received a copy

19:44.535 --> 19:47.235
of the introduction speech
Mr. Zajac wrote for tomorrow.

19:49.071 --> 19:52.273
- ( Scoffs ) Kill it.
- Sir?

19:53.876 --> 19:57.178
Strangers, acquaintances.

19:57.180 --> 19:59.780
<i>None of you have</i>
<i>any idea who I am.</i>

19:59.782 --> 20:01.749
No speech.

20:01.751 --> 20:03.417
No press for anyone.

20:03.419 --> 20:06.954
Let them just sit there
and listen.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.190
Keep their damn
mouths shut.

20:13.562 --> 20:15.063
( Tom sighs )

20:15.065 --> 20:17.965
Walsh: <i>Narcissus staring</i>
<i>at himself in the lake</i>

20:17.967 --> 20:21.234
and making every major media
outlet in the country watch.

20:21.236 --> 20:23.069
Tina: <i>It'll be a virtual</i>
<i>press blackout for us.</i>

20:23.071 --> 20:26.038
Perhaps you should take
advantage of the lull, ma'am.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.207
There's no coasting in politics.
Not here, anyway.

20:28.209 --> 20:31.743
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
Somebody get me a Coke.

20:31.745 --> 20:33.245
So what do we got, then?

20:33.247 --> 20:35.880
Six stops between
Carbondale and Rockford

20:35.882 --> 20:38.649
culminating in a rally
at the Knox County Fair.

20:38.651 --> 20:41.486
<i>It may not get</i> <i>a lot of press
that day,</i> <i>but we'll get bodies.</i>

20:41.488 --> 20:44.255
Decatur, Bloomington,
Champaign.

20:44.257 --> 20:48.292
All cities of over 50,000 with a
strong voter profile in your favor.

20:48.294 --> 20:51.261
Right, so while we're out here
preaching to the choir,

20:51.263 --> 20:54.331
Kane's spending money on
O'Hare like a drunken sailor

20:54.333 --> 20:56.399
and grabbing power
from the Housing Authority.

20:56.401 --> 21:00.970
Somebody want to tell me why we're
not capitalizing on either?

21:00.972 --> 21:03.073
Well, we have a number of
high-end fundraisers scheduled

21:03.075 --> 21:05.241
in addition
to public appearances.

21:05.243 --> 21:06.910
You really think
my judging a steer contest

21:06.912 --> 21:09.045
at the county fair
is going to help my numbers?

21:09.047 --> 21:12.549
But to cancel is to run
the risk of alienating.

21:12.551 --> 21:15.052
My base wants me to win.
That's it.

21:15.054 --> 21:17.087
And they know the only way
I get into office

21:17.089 --> 21:19.223
is by stripping votes
out of Chicago.

21:19.225 --> 21:23.061
<i>Let's head back,</i> <i>find those
pockets</i> <i>of neglect and fear,</i>

21:23.063 --> 21:25.297
the wards adjacent
to Lennox Gardens.

21:25.299 --> 21:27.065
He takes his day,
I'll take mine.

21:27.067 --> 21:28.734
Are you sure
you're up for that?

21:28.736 --> 21:30.770
You know,
with your leg?

21:32.873 --> 21:35.641
- Brass tacks?
- By all means.

21:35.643 --> 21:37.410
This ordinance
is a tough sell.

21:37.412 --> 21:39.879
( laughs )
For the Progressives, maybe.

21:39.881 --> 21:42.515
But the Latino Caucus
has always made an effort

21:42.517 --> 21:45.651
to accommodate matters
of interest to the mayor.

21:45.653 --> 21:49.121
Ian, get the alderman a treat.
He's being so obedient.

21:49.123 --> 21:51.257
( Stifled laugh )

21:51.259 --> 21:53.025
Leave the room, please.

22:08.676 --> 22:11.879
The problem is I haven't seen
a viable relocation proposal.

22:11.881 --> 22:13.647
I have similar concerns.

22:13.649 --> 22:16.550
- What Adriana means is--
- I don't need a translator.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.219
What I need is assurance that
the Lennox Gardens residents

22:19.221 --> 22:21.756
<i>won't be dumped</i>
<i>into the 30th.</i>

22:21.758 --> 22:23.291
And if Lalo were here, he'd
be saying the same thing.

22:23.293 --> 22:25.559
- Lalo valued unity.
- He valued his job.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.962
- Do you?
- Of course.

22:27.964 --> 22:31.265
I'm honored to have been
appointed to my husband's seat.

22:31.267 --> 22:34.869
Then I look forward to stumping for
you in your next election, Mrs. Mata.

22:34.871 --> 22:37.238
( laughs nervously )

22:37.240 --> 22:40.709
We'll advise our caucus members of
our continued support for you, sir.

22:40.711 --> 22:43.412
Thanks, Carlos.
Adriana.

22:45.882 --> 22:48.417
Tom, I want to work
with you on this,

22:48.419 --> 22:50.953
but the Progressive Caucus
has never been so fractured.

22:50.955 --> 22:53.990
And between Mata,
Ross, Ezra,

22:53.992 --> 22:56.759
there's a power vacuum
going on.

22:56.761 --> 23:01.130
My opinion-- it's not a
great time to move on this.

23:04.401 --> 23:06.335
It means
that much to you?

23:06.337 --> 23:07.904
It does.

23:10.941 --> 23:13.443
Well, then,
I guess now's the time.

23:13.445 --> 23:14.944
- ( Knocks )
- Ben: <i>Walsh is</i> closing the gap.

23:14.946 --> 23:16.779
I'm not worried about it.

23:18.816 --> 23:20.950
Thank you.
What's your name?

23:20.952 --> 23:22.418
Patty.

23:22.420 --> 23:23.953
Appreciate you
volunteering.

23:23.955 --> 23:26.556
You'll get a big bounce
after the expansion ceremony.

23:26.558 --> 23:28.191
<i>And then it's back</i>
<i>to the usual spread.</i>

23:28.193 --> 23:30.027
She's got downstate,
you've got Kane.

23:30.029 --> 23:33.497
When is the last time anyone from his
organization coordinated with ours?

23:33.499 --> 23:36.166
Oh, for God's sake, Ben.
You'll be seen with him tomorrow.

23:36.168 --> 23:39.469
<i>And not just on WGN.</i> <i>He's giving
you</i> <i>a national platform.</i>

23:39.471 --> 23:40.737
Be fucking grateful.

23:42.407 --> 23:44.575
- <i>Did you look at my speech?</i>
- Not yet, no.

23:47.012 --> 23:49.847
- How's that game of Words With Friends?
- <i>Heh.</i>

23:49.849 --> 23:52.483
What the hell?
I'm checking my email.

23:55.154 --> 23:57.789
- Fuck.
- <i>What is it?</i>

23:57.791 --> 24:00.091
Motherfucker.

24:01.761 --> 24:03.628
He cut my introduction.

24:03.630 --> 24:05.196
Shit.

24:13.606 --> 24:15.540
You doing all right?

24:15.542 --> 24:18.543
I mean, I know you
and Stone went way back.

24:18.545 --> 24:20.579
Not as far
as you and me.

24:20.581 --> 24:22.948
Who are you
calling old?

24:25.051 --> 24:28.421
I want you to introduce me at the
O'Hare expansion ceremony tomorrow.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.689
( Sighs )

24:30.691 --> 24:33.292
Are you out of your tree?
I'm no politician.

24:33.294 --> 24:34.994
Exactly why I want
you to do it.

24:34.996 --> 24:38.897
You know who I was,
who I am.

24:38.899 --> 24:41.433
- It's just a few words.
- I don't know, Tom.

24:41.435 --> 24:43.536
I'll even write
the damn thing for you.

24:43.538 --> 24:45.171
Think about it.

24:50.244 --> 24:51.911
You visit Emma yet?

24:53.847 --> 24:55.949
I'm not sure
she wants to see me.

24:55.951 --> 24:58.819
She'll come around.

24:58.821 --> 25:00.987
You had to do it.

25:00.989 --> 25:03.690
She knows you couldn't play favorites.
You're the mayor.

25:05.593 --> 25:09.463
Though you'll always be the kid
with the smart mouth to me.

25:09.465 --> 25:10.964
<i>( Tom chuckles )</i>

25:15.770 --> 25:18.238
Kavanaugh:
<i>Couple of lookers, huh?</i>

25:18.240 --> 25:19.873
I mean me and you,
of course.

25:19.875 --> 25:22.876
The occasion,
it eludes me.

25:22.878 --> 25:24.578
I can't even remember
their names.

25:24.580 --> 25:27.247
- <i>Can you?</i>
- <i>Not a clue.</i>

25:27.249 --> 25:30.283
We both did all right back
in the day if you recall.

25:30.285 --> 25:32.486
I suppose we did.

25:32.488 --> 25:36.422
So you'll do
my intro, then?

25:40.594 --> 25:42.928
<i>( Typing )</i>

25:42.930 --> 25:44.363
<i>( door opens )</i>

25:46.266 --> 25:48.400
- Thank you.
- Mr. Baine.

25:48.402 --> 25:50.302
This is a surprise.

25:50.304 --> 25:53.039
I see you've gotten
comfortable.

25:53.041 --> 25:55.241
I have.

25:55.243 --> 25:56.909
( Sighs )

25:56.911 --> 25:59.912
Do you know how much
this paper represents

25:59.914 --> 26:02.548
in terms of all of my media
holdings, Mr. Miller?

26:02.550 --> 26:04.984
I believe
it's one-half of 1%.

26:04.986 --> 26:09.155
I mention it not to suggest that the
"Sentinel" isn't important to me.

26:09.157 --> 26:11.557
It is, very.
In fact, if it weren't,

26:11.559 --> 26:13.793
I wouldn't be here
with you now.

26:13.795 --> 26:16.930
- Okay.
- I read your editorial.

26:16.932 --> 26:18.865
I think it's some
of my best work.

26:18.867 --> 26:22.535
McGantry Enterprises,
Nyco, Tizer--

26:22.537 --> 26:24.137
you know what those are?

26:25.740 --> 26:28.108
Evil, monolithic
corporations?

26:28.110 --> 26:30.444
They're businesses with
a stake in the redevelopment

26:30.446 --> 26:32.746
of an area currently
known as Lennox Gardens.

26:32.748 --> 26:36.150
With all due respect, you said
I could go after Kane at will

26:36.152 --> 26:38.418
if I rode out
that one news cycle.

26:38.420 --> 26:40.320
Just the one.
I did that.

26:40.322 --> 26:42.089
This isn't about the mayor.

26:42.091 --> 26:45.326
This is about
the bottom line-- ours.

26:45.328 --> 26:48.028
See, Jack Bentley
understood this.

26:48.030 --> 26:50.431
Did I make a mistake
in letting him go?

26:50.433 --> 26:52.967
No, you did not.

26:52.969 --> 26:54.769
<i>Well, I'm relieved</i>
<i>to hear it</i>

26:54.771 --> 26:58.173
and so will our previously
mentioned corporate friends.

26:58.175 --> 27:01.576
Like you, they'll be attending
the O'Hare expansion ceremony.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.044
In fact,
while you're there,

27:03.046 --> 27:06.748
<i>you might consider apologizing</i>
<i>for your misguided opinion.</i>

27:06.750 --> 27:08.784
<i>Ask them to reconsider</i>

27:08.786 --> 27:11.253
pulling their ads
from our publication.

27:12.789 --> 27:15.490
Yes, sir.

27:15.492 --> 27:18.693
<i>And buy yourself</i>
<i>a decent suit.</i>

27:18.695 --> 27:20.162
You look like shit.

27:52.528 --> 27:54.896
The groundbreaking
ceremony is tomorrow.

27:54.898 --> 27:57.765
I only wish you
could be there for it.

27:57.767 --> 28:00.168
The new terminal is a part
of your legacy, too, after all.

28:00.170 --> 28:03.071
I'm going to make sure
Tom names one after you.

28:03.073 --> 28:04.706
Won't that be nice?

28:13.316 --> 28:15.717
I'm sure you haven't
given this much thought,

28:15.719 --> 28:18.219
but my father
was a man of action.

28:18.221 --> 28:22.658
He found things like talk shows
to be a rather hollow exercise.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.660
<i>He shouldn't be forced</i>
<i>to endure them now</i>

28:24.662 --> 28:27.263
simply because a caregiver
was too unconcerned

28:27.265 --> 28:28.931
to ask what he might
prefer to watch.

28:33.871 --> 28:37.506
It was news.
Primarily local.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.442
Yes, ma'am.

28:44.814 --> 28:46.715
I'll get his clothes.

28:59.829 --> 29:00.862
Now, there we are.

29:06.469 --> 29:08.604
He's sick, Daddy.

29:08.606 --> 29:10.506
You may outlive him
after all.

29:11.808 --> 29:15.845
You're letting nostalgia
cloud your judgment.

29:15.847 --> 29:18.848
Alderman Ross' commitment
to this community

29:18.850 --> 29:21.150
has nothing to do with
my personal affiliations.

29:21.152 --> 29:23.519
Violent crimes
in that area are 3% higher

29:23.521 --> 29:25.421
than anywhere else
in the city.

29:25.423 --> 29:27.757
The Gardens were thriving
until the mayor slashed

29:27.759 --> 29:31.193
the 21st law enforcement
budget in his first term.

29:31.195 --> 29:32.761
And now he cites
crime rates

29:32.763 --> 29:36.231
<i>as a reason to evict</i>
<i>poor families?</i>

29:36.233 --> 29:38.167
Today...

29:38.169 --> 29:41.104
an unemployment rate
quadruple the state's average--

29:41.106 --> 29:43.940
<i>that is the Lennox</i> <i>Gardens we're
discussing,</i> <i>Miss Fredricks.</i>

29:43.942 --> 29:46.677
The mayor's redevelopment
could create hundreds of jobs

29:46.679 --> 29:49.213
that could eventually go
to current residents.

29:49.215 --> 29:51.949
Really? To untrained,
unskilled workers?

29:51.951 --> 29:55.453
Tom: <i>Living in better housing,</i>
<i>in better school districts.</i>

29:55.455 --> 29:57.555
Where is Alderman Ross?

29:57.557 --> 30:01.192
I haven't seen him since he sacrificed the
dignity of his position on live television.

30:01.194 --> 30:03.961
Taking hundreds of
foreclosures off the market

30:03.963 --> 30:07.798
and turning them into rental properties
suggests a win for the banks, Mr. Mayor,

30:07.800 --> 30:10.134
not the people
of the 21st ward.

30:10.136 --> 30:12.636
Alverson: <i>So instead of</i>
<i>gang-infested blight,</i>

30:12.638 --> 30:15.739
we'd have people living
in single family homes.

30:15.741 --> 30:18.442
You know,
I'm baffled as to why

30:18.444 --> 30:20.278
you can't seem
to see the upside--

30:20.280 --> 30:23.113
Because they can't
afford to live in them.

30:23.115 --> 30:26.350
What we're really talking about
here is permanent displacement.

30:26.352 --> 30:28.118
Alverson:
<i>New transit systems.</i>

30:28.120 --> 30:30.887
I've reviewed
the mayor's proposal.

30:30.889 --> 30:32.956
I've also reviewed
his record.

30:34.591 --> 30:36.592
<i>With the exception</i>
<i>of Mr. Alverson,</i>

30:36.594 --> 30:38.828
the Black Caucus is united.

30:38.830 --> 30:41.630
And Alderman Ross
has 14 solid nays.

30:44.300 --> 30:46.802
If your employer

30:46.804 --> 30:49.804
wants to be a factor
in this negotiation,

30:49.806 --> 30:52.140
tell him to show up
for work.

30:52.142 --> 30:55.476
Otherwise, it may be time
for the Black Caucus

30:55.478 --> 30:57.378
to find new leadership.

30:59.481 --> 31:02.783
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

31:02.785 --> 31:04.686
- <i>( distant siren blaring )</i>
- <i>( Rap music playing )</i>

31:17.665 --> 31:19.599
Oh.

31:36.719 --> 31:38.620
Yo, is Trey even here?

31:41.924 --> 31:44.859
It's taking him--
it's been a while, man.

31:48.863 --> 31:51.898
( laughs )
Look at cuz.

31:51.900 --> 31:54.434
<i>Hope you ain't mind</i>
<i>the wait.</i>

31:54.436 --> 31:56.703
Getting ready for work.

31:56.705 --> 31:58.237
Get my tie for me.

32:01.809 --> 32:05.045
Doing politics with
our new ward boss.

32:05.047 --> 32:07.780
Knocking on doors,
registering voters.

32:07.782 --> 32:10.216
Might even make it
to alderman at some point.

32:10.218 --> 32:12.418
What's wrong?

32:12.420 --> 32:14.587
You never thought you'd see
my ass straight up, huh?

32:14.589 --> 32:17.257
Are you?
Straight up?

32:19.393 --> 32:21.327
Thanks, baby.

32:24.198 --> 32:27.267
You came all the way over
here to ask me that, man?

32:27.269 --> 32:29.702
No, no.

32:29.704 --> 32:33.106
<i>I need your help, man.</i>

32:33.108 --> 32:35.642
( laughs )

32:35.644 --> 32:37.778
You need my help?

32:37.780 --> 32:41.382
You ain't one of my guys.
Never have been.

32:41.384 --> 32:43.050
And you know that.

32:43.052 --> 32:45.653
That's why I ain't got
to do shit for you.

32:49.726 --> 32:51.827
I need you to get
to someone for me.

32:57.600 --> 33:01.002
I want to thank you all so
much for being here today

33:01.004 --> 33:04.305
and allowing me to spend some
time in beautiful Ashburn.

33:04.307 --> 33:06.139
- Man: <i>Thank you.</i>
- Woman: <i>All right.</i>

33:08.309 --> 33:12.578
But I can't imagine it was
easy keeping it this way.

33:12.580 --> 33:15.881
Because while Mayor Kane siphons
money from the state budget

33:15.883 --> 33:18.417
for pet projects
like the O'Hare expansion,

33:18.419 --> 33:22.722
he robs working people of money
needed for their schools,

33:22.724 --> 33:25.491
their clinics,
their libraries.

33:25.493 --> 33:29.029
<i>And now the mayor has</i>
<i>an urban renewal program</i>

33:29.031 --> 33:32.733
<i>which would call</i> <i>for relocating
families</i> <i>to this neighborhood,</i>

33:32.735 --> 33:36.170
a neighborhood that
is already overtaxed

33:36.172 --> 33:38.172
and underserviced
by city government.

33:38.174 --> 33:40.174
We don't have enough
cops as it is.

33:40.176 --> 33:42.209
So how are we supposed
to protect ourselves

33:42.211 --> 33:44.378
when these project people
start moving in?

33:44.380 --> 33:47.381
This is not
a matter of race.

33:47.383 --> 33:50.918
What concerns me, and
should concern all of you,

33:50.920 --> 33:52.920
is that public money

33:52.922 --> 33:55.688
is being spent for
the benefit of everyone

33:55.690 --> 33:58.491
but the working class.

33:58.493 --> 34:00.960
There is no running
for governor a fifth time.

34:00.962 --> 34:03.096
If she doesn't take
Springfield this year,

34:03.098 --> 34:04.764
she never will.
Walsh knows that.

34:04.766 --> 34:08.502
So rather than you losing
ground, she's made gains.

34:08.504 --> 34:11.371
Minor.
Temporary.

34:11.373 --> 34:13.339
Obviously she won't
be able to poach

34:13.341 --> 34:15.742
Cook County votes
in any significant way.

34:15.744 --> 34:18.745
Anti-felon bill be damned.
But she is trying.

34:18.746 --> 34:20.714
Which is why I think
it's important

34:20.716 --> 34:23.483
that I have your clear and visible support
as early as possible in the race.

34:25.085 --> 34:27.355
- You think it's important?
- Just in a sense--

34:27.357 --> 34:29.223
Mixed messages.

34:29.225 --> 34:31.659
I don't follow.

34:31.661 --> 34:33.761
Of course you don't follow.
Nobody fucking follows.

34:35.429 --> 34:39.534
20 years of cajoling,
pushing, fighting,

34:39.536 --> 34:42.404
ultimately succeeding--

34:42.406 --> 34:45.206
it deserves
its own moment,

34:45.208 --> 34:47.443
a singularity of intent.

34:47.445 --> 34:49.779
What's been done for the
city, what will be done--

34:49.781 --> 34:52.681
that is the message
that must be communicated,

34:52.684 --> 34:55.051
not a pitch
for the candidate

34:55.053 --> 34:58.221
who's become material
in the last month.

35:01.759 --> 35:03.626
Last thing--
Rick Mathers,

35:03.628 --> 35:06.296
my campaign manager.

35:06.298 --> 35:08.832
He's only ever run
alderman races.

35:08.834 --> 35:10.901
He's not focused, he's not
driven, he's not helping.

35:10.903 --> 35:12.670
I think we need
to make a change.

35:12.672 --> 35:14.438
Do what you need to do.

35:19.912 --> 35:21.846
I look forward to
the O'Hare ceremony.

35:21.848 --> 35:23.480
Should be something.

35:26.184 --> 35:28.986
Oh, and don't talk to the
press while you're there.

35:30.288 --> 35:31.422
At all.

35:35.427 --> 35:38.062
Make yourself as small a target
as possible-- that's the key.

35:38.064 --> 35:41.265
But taken to an extreme,
one risks becoming...

35:41.267 --> 35:42.934
invisible.

35:45.271 --> 35:47.439
How can I help you,
Miss Fredricks?

35:48.775 --> 35:51.511
As you know,
Alderman Ross is opposed

35:51.513 --> 35:53.746
to the ordinance
allowing Lennox Gardens

35:53.748 --> 35:55.748
to be pulled from the Housing
Authority's control.

35:56.917 --> 35:58.751
No, thanks.

35:58.753 --> 36:00.519
Luncheon with
budget management today.

36:00.521 --> 36:03.355
Gonna need it.

36:03.357 --> 36:05.791
I understand you're voting
with the mayor.

36:05.793 --> 36:07.325
That's right.

36:07.327 --> 36:11.163
The streets in your ward
are about to become metered,

36:11.165 --> 36:13.665
despite four attempts
on your part

36:13.667 --> 36:16.501
<i>to pass legislation</i>
<i>blocking it.</i>

36:16.503 --> 36:18.436
Free parking--

36:18.438 --> 36:22.074
it's a surprisingly strong
issue for your constituents.

36:22.076 --> 36:23.775
It is.

36:25.945 --> 36:27.547
Cold out today.

36:29.716 --> 36:32.384
It'll be fall before you
know it, Alderman Vukovich.

36:33.887 --> 36:35.621
I'm putting a new version
of my ordinance

36:35.623 --> 36:37.123
on the docket in October.

36:37.125 --> 36:39.058
Still won't have any
friends in the chambers,

36:39.060 --> 36:40.993
because you don't.

36:44.464 --> 36:46.532
Alderman Ross and myself,

36:46.534 --> 36:48.901
<i>we've got lots of friends.</i>

37:04.519 --> 37:06.687
Was he married?

37:06.689 --> 37:09.257
No.

37:09.259 --> 37:11.926
But he meant
something to you.

37:16.599 --> 37:18.500
It wasn't like that.

37:23.272 --> 37:25.774
Why did you come
home, Kitty?

37:25.776 --> 37:28.743
I told you already.
I just needed to get away for a bit.

37:30.946 --> 37:32.713
<i>Tell me what you did...</i>

37:34.550 --> 37:36.784
<i>to lose your job.</i>

37:41.390 --> 37:42.924
Nothing.

37:46.896 --> 37:49.197
( Mumbling )

37:49.199 --> 37:51.265
The city of "I will."

37:51.267 --> 37:54.335
( continues mumbling )

37:59.908 --> 38:03.177
The world entering our city
is to be made wider still.

38:03.179 --> 38:05.111
Portal.

38:05.113 --> 38:08.114
( Continues mumbling )

38:24.264 --> 38:25.664
Mr. Mayor.

38:27.100 --> 38:28.834
Can I get you a coffee?
Something to eat?

38:28.836 --> 38:30.469
Just give me
the whip count.

38:30.471 --> 38:33.939
Mona Fredricks has locked in the
majority of the Black Caucus,

38:33.941 --> 38:36.541
though we still have
a solid yea from Alverson.

38:36.543 --> 38:38.777
Progressives are split.
It's looking like a tie,

38:38.779 --> 38:41.746
which, of course, you could
break with the deciding vote.

38:41.748 --> 38:43.015
Is that all?

38:43.017 --> 38:44.917
I was unable to connect
with Alderman Vukovich,

38:44.919 --> 38:47.553
- though she's a likely yea.
- Likely.

38:47.555 --> 38:50.723
We could postpone the vote,
give ourselves enough time--

38:50.725 --> 38:54.693
What part of "I don't want to postpone the
fucking vote" do you not understand?!

38:54.695 --> 38:56.595
I'm throwing
the biggest goddamn party

38:56.597 --> 38:58.764
of my political
career tomorrow.

38:58.766 --> 39:01.266
And the guest of honor
is an ordinance

39:01.268 --> 39:03.468
that allows me the power
to actually fix something

39:03.470 --> 39:05.270
without having to wait
for 20 fucking years.

39:05.272 --> 39:07.373
Now you're telling me
some-- some...

39:07.375 --> 39:11.042
bullshit legislative
end run is going to stop me.

39:18.484 --> 39:20.852
( Sighs )

39:23.455 --> 39:26.758
Look, I worked with Ezra

39:26.760 --> 39:29.027
for 30 years.

39:29.029 --> 39:32.464
I can try to track
Vukovich down.

39:34.333 --> 39:35.967
I'll handle that.

39:43.542 --> 39:46.210
<i>( Siren wailing )</i>

39:47.780 --> 39:49.947
Jesus Christ.

39:57.890 --> 40:00.425
License and registration,
please, ma'am.

40:01.494 --> 40:03.061
Do you know why
I pulled you over?

40:03.063 --> 40:05.130
One second.
Let me get my credentials.

40:05.132 --> 40:07.132
Have you been
drinking, ma'am?

40:07.134 --> 40:09.569
I had a glass of wine
with lunch.

40:09.571 --> 40:12.405
Dina Vukovich,
Alderman for the 14th ward.

40:12.407 --> 40:15.308
I really need to get back
to chambers for a vote.

40:15.310 --> 40:17.410
I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car

40:17.412 --> 40:20.012
for a sobriety test,
please.

40:20.014 --> 40:22.682
Then send Mitchell to the Commerce Commission.
I don't give a shit.

40:22.684 --> 40:25.818
- Mitchell's in DC for a trade conference.
- He's in DC.

40:25.820 --> 40:29.455
Then why the fuck am I
stuck here in Springfield?

40:29.457 --> 40:31.190
Never mind.
What else?

40:31.192 --> 40:32.691
Secretary:
<i>Governor Cullen,</i>

40:32.693 --> 40:35.928
<i>State Treasurer Zajac</i>
<i>is on the line.</i>

40:35.930 --> 40:39.398
How's that for
big brass balls?

40:40.900 --> 40:42.400
Governor Cullen.

40:42.402 --> 40:44.235
Ben: <i>Hey, Governor,</i> <i>how are you?</i>

40:44.237 --> 40:47.005
Look, what happened
in the primary,

40:47.007 --> 40:49.507
that was seriously
messed up.

40:49.509 --> 40:52.243
And I want you to know

40:52.245 --> 40:54.011
how sorry I am
for my part in it.

40:54.013 --> 40:56.247
<i>Obviously I was in</i>
<i>over my head.</i>

40:56.249 --> 40:59.416
But, look, nothing I can do
about it now and here we are.

40:59.418 --> 41:01.385
Here we are.

41:01.387 --> 41:03.287
So I'm sure
you've seen the polls.

41:03.289 --> 41:05.189
This race is a lot tighter
than anyone expected

41:05.191 --> 41:07.958
- and old Kane is MIA in his support.
- <i>Huh.</i>

41:07.960 --> 41:10.527
<i>So I was wondering,</i>

41:10.529 --> 41:13.029
<i>any weaknesses of Walsh's</i>
<i>I should be attacking?</i>

41:15.299 --> 41:16.933
Weaknesses?

41:16.935 --> 41:19.703
<i>Look, Mac, if she wins,</i>
<i>she's gonna undo</i>

41:19.705 --> 41:21.304
<i>four terms</i>
<i>of your hard work.</i>

41:21.306 --> 41:23.874
Kane may not care about the
state, but I know that you do.

41:23.876 --> 41:26.310
<i>Huh, I appreciate that.</i>

41:26.312 --> 41:30.014
And this is my advice

41:30.016 --> 41:32.116
to you, Mr. Zajac.

41:33.318 --> 41:34.885
<i>Eat shit.</i>

41:37.356 --> 41:39.056
( laughs )

41:42.093 --> 41:43.260
<i>( buzzer sounds )</i>

41:45.163 --> 41:46.630
Ian:
<i>Alderman Vukovich?</i>

41:48.767 --> 41:51.135
My name is Ian Todd.
I work for the mayor.

41:51.137 --> 41:54.339
He asked me to reach out on his
behalf and help in any way he could.

41:54.341 --> 41:56.508
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Of course.

41:56.510 --> 41:59.844
I'm told that you were pulled
over by a police officer.

41:59.846 --> 42:01.880
I am not drunk.

42:01.882 --> 42:05.150
<i>But you refused</i>
<i>a breathalyzer.</i>

42:05.152 --> 42:07.419
I'm sure if you were to take the
test now, it would prove you

42:07.421 --> 42:09.154
well below the legal
limit for alcohol.

42:09.156 --> 42:10.789
That's right.

42:10.791 --> 42:13.225
Unfortunately there's a lot
of paperwork involved

42:13.227 --> 42:15.493
in securing your release
and the dropping of charges.

42:15.495 --> 42:16.995
It'll take a while.

42:16.997 --> 42:19.597
But the mayor,

42:19.599 --> 42:22.500
aware of your commitment
to voting on all ordinances,

42:22.502 --> 42:25.771
thought you might want to arrange
for yours to be cast by proxy.

42:27.640 --> 42:29.675
Ortiz:
Lennox Gardens

42:29.677 --> 42:33.913
can and will be reborn.

42:35.282 --> 42:38.718
<i>It can be made better.</i>

42:38.720 --> 42:42.955
<i>It can and will be a symbol</i>
<i>of pride for this city,</i>

42:42.957 --> 42:46.158
<i>not shame, not fear,</i>

42:46.160 --> 42:47.626
<i>not failure.</i>

42:47.628 --> 42:49.728
<i>That can't happen</i>
<i>without a steady hand,</i>

42:49.730 --> 42:53.298
<i>a guiding force,</i>
<i>a visionary.</i>

42:53.300 --> 42:55.967
<i>And it won't happen</i>
<i>by committee,</i>

42:55.969 --> 42:58.670
<i>particularly one</i>
<i>paralyzed by--</i>

42:58.672 --> 43:01.973
Move to close the debate.

43:01.975 --> 43:03.241
I second the motion.

43:05.176 --> 43:07.544
Let the voting begin
on the ordinance

43:07.546 --> 43:09.646
to remove Lennox Gardens
from the jurisdiction

43:09.648 --> 43:12.215

Kane votes in

44:36.604 --> 44:38.171
That can't happen.

44:38.173 --> 44:39.839
It means too much
to too many people.

44:39.841 --> 44:41.575
I need you to vote

44:41.577 --> 44:45.012
You know I can't
do that, Mona.

Kissing ad exec ass.

Good,

Yeah.

Someone from Rosehill Cemetery

Oh, yes.
It's a beautiful day, too.

47:50.505 --> 47:53.906
Mrs. Kane, would you consider this
your husband's biggest achievement?

47:53.908 --> 47:57.076
Absolutely.
It's a battle he's fought for years.

47:57.078 --> 48:00.146
And that he's never wavered
in his desire to modernize

48:00.148 --> 48:01.781
our most important gateway

48:01.783 --> 48:04.617
is a testament to his
commitment to the city.

48:04.619 --> 48:07.653
Which is not to say he hasn't had a
lot of help from his lovely wife.

48:07.655 --> 48:11.089
Mr. McGantry, how big a role do you see
your company playing in the expansion?

48:11.091 --> 48:13.292
McGantry Enterprises has always
played a part in city re-development

48:13.294 --> 48:15.894
and will continue to do so.

48:15.896 --> 48:19.698
As long as its CEO
behaves himself.

48:19.700 --> 48:22.200
Fiscally, of course.

48:23.603 --> 48:25.538
Wow.

48:25.540 --> 48:27.806
Quite a production
for a groundbreaking.

48:27.808 --> 48:29.708
Yeah.

48:29.710 --> 48:31.710
It might just be easier
to go around.

48:33.480 --> 48:35.947
Oh, that's right, you're
not allowed to campaign.

full support?

48:53.767 --> 48:55.701
The mayor is a great man.

48:55.703 --> 48:57.569
He's a friend

53:41.489 --> 53:45.825
that are in need of our immediate
attention, areas of neglect.

53:45.827 --> 53:47.827
<i>And if time</i>
<i>is the justice</i>

53:47.829 --> 53:49.762
that examines
all offenders,

53:49.764 --> 53:52.232
then city hall

53:52.234 --> 53:55.969
is guilty of inaction.

53:55.971 --> 53:57.737
Public housing
is such an area.

53:57.739 --> 54:00.774
Lennox Gardens,
John Robinson Homes,

54:00.776 --> 54:03.443
Washington Heights.

54:14.789 --> 54:18.725
With your support
and, hopefully,

54:18.727 --> 54:20.427
with that
of the city council,

54:20.429 --> 54:22.629
I will soon have
an opportunity

54:22.631 --> 54:26.900
to address that neglect
and be given the tools

54:26.902 --> 54:30.938
to start over,
to reimagine, rebuild,

54:30.940 --> 54:33.807
and reclaim the dream

54:33.809 --> 54:36.176
that once was.

54:36.178 --> 54:40.580
They say that greatness

54:40.582 --> 54:43.549
is not a matter of chance,
it's a matter of choice.

54:43.551 --> 54:47.053
I say that greatness is not
something we can wait for.

54:47.055 --> 54:50.156
It's something
we achieve.

54:50.158 --> 54:52.158
And we'll do it together.

54:52.160 --> 54:53.826
( Cheering )

54:53.828 --> 54:57.329
Because we are
the city

54:57.331 --> 54:58.764
of "I will."

54:59.867 --> 55:02.335
<i>Thank you.</i>

55:02.337 --> 55:05.139
- <i>( Instrumental</i> music playing )
- Thank you. God bless you.

55:25.061 --> 55:27.229
<i>( Gunshots )</i>

55:27.231 --> 55:30.398
<i>( people screaming )</i>

55:30.400 --> 55:32.600
- Man: <i>Shots fired!</i>
- Get him up! Get him out of here!

55:32.602 --> 55:36.170
- Get me an ambulance now!
- Get him out of here now!

55:49.986 --> 55:51.520
This way, this way!

56:16.879 --> 56:18.780
