01:52.765 --> 01:55.532
<i>So, are we going
to swim or what?</i>

01:55.534 --> 01:57.267
<i>We didn't bring
our bathing suits.</i>

01:57.269 --> 01:58.437
- Lina, come!
- No.

01:59.438 --> 02:00.473
Not coming?

02:02.241 --> 02:04.310
Have fun by yourself
on the beach!

02:44.952 --> 02:46.619
Hello, Mama.

02:46.621 --> 02:48.656
Take off your shoes
if they're dirty.

03:14.316 --> 03:15.415
Papa!

03:16.652 --> 03:18.986
Careful. You'll hurt him.

03:18.988 --> 03:20.755
No, he's strong as an ox.

03:20.757 --> 03:22.289
I meant you.

03:22.291 --> 03:23.459
Good evening, Mrs. Vilkas.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.501
About time
you had a proper kit.

03:33.503 --> 03:34.635
And no need to be sparing.

03:34.637 --> 03:36.871
We'll restock it before
the Kaunas Summer Arts Program.

03:40.543 --> 03:41.977
You like it?

03:41.979 --> 03:43.714
Of course. Thank you.

03:44.782 --> 03:46.414
But...

03:46.416 --> 03:49.451
I won't get accepted
to Kaunas Arts.

03:49.453 --> 03:50.552
It's too competitive.

03:50.554 --> 03:52.521
It would be a shame
if everyone thought like that

03:52.523 --> 03:54.690
and no one applied.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.325
They have to accept pupils.

03:56.327 --> 03:57.626
I can't think
of a single reason

03:57.628 --> 03:58.696
you shouldn't be one of them.

04:07.773 --> 04:09.404
Where did you get that ball?

04:09.406 --> 04:10.573
Vidas.

04:10.575 --> 04:12.443
He was kicked out of class.

04:13.411 --> 04:14.644
I'm watching it for him.

04:14.646 --> 04:16.648
And why was Vidas
kicked out of class?

04:18.716 --> 04:21.483
He was talking about hell.

04:21.486 --> 04:23.988
Well, that's not a very pleasant
thing to talk about.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.622
He said soon,

04:25.624 --> 04:27.927
Lithuania will be part of hell.

04:30.495 --> 04:32.663
Why do you think
he would he say that?

04:32.665 --> 04:34.432
His papa told him.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.302
Is it true?

04:40.740 --> 04:42.840
Do you know what the other
professors and I talk about

04:42.842 --> 04:43.843
all day?

04:44.544 --> 04:45.578
Perception.

04:46.412 --> 04:48.445
Art is all perception.

04:48.447 --> 04:50.381
In the end, we find,

04:50.383 --> 04:53.053
it's not what you see
but how you see it.

04:54.054 --> 04:55.754
And right now, I see

04:55.756 --> 04:57.622
a delicious piece of cake
in front of me.

04:57.624 --> 04:58.926
Thank you, dear.

05:00.828 --> 05:04.464
We must also remember
that life is not a painting.

05:05.432 --> 05:06.832
Life is not art.

05:06.834 --> 05:08.867
It moves and changes,

05:08.869 --> 05:10.504
and it has its realities.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.474
And so through art,

05:16.476 --> 05:18.478
may our realities
be illuminated.

05:24.786 --> 05:26.586
<i>Your own family
comes first.</i>

05:26.588 --> 05:28.454
Why do I have to
say that to you?

05:28.456 --> 05:30.190
They are also family.

05:30.192 --> 05:31.924
And we are
in a position to help.

05:31.926 --> 05:33.759
But at what costs?

05:33.761 --> 05:35.095
Would you have me
punctuate the risk

05:35.097 --> 05:36.163
with every sentence?

05:36.165 --> 05:38.065
I want you to be realistic.

05:38.067 --> 05:40.200
How am I unrealistic?

05:40.202 --> 05:43.070
By encouraging Lina to apply
to Kaunas Arts.

05:43.072 --> 05:44.705
When you know
it might not even existing.

05:44.707 --> 05:47.007
You're chiding me
for believing in our children?

05:47.009 --> 05:49.610
She needs to learn
to get out of her head, Kostas.

05:49.612 --> 05:51.845
She comes home every day
from school.

05:51.847 --> 05:53.881
She goes straight to her room
and draws.

05:53.883 --> 05:55.048
Yes, brilliantly.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.950
With no previous instruction
whatsoever.

05:56.952 --> 05:58.619
She has no friends.

05:58.621 --> 05:59.954
She shoos boys away.

05:59.956 --> 06:02.623
Elena. Please.

06:02.625 --> 06:05.492
We must think
beyond the walls of this house.

06:05.494 --> 06:07.862
We must we must try
to help others

06:07.864 --> 06:09.431
while we still can.

06:19.009 --> 06:20.410
I have to go.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.102
It came.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.536
Something of a miracle.

07:19.538 --> 07:21.674
We hardly got any mail recently.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.014
Aren't you going to open it?

07:29.716 --> 07:31.718
I'm going to wait
to open it with Papa.

08:26.976 --> 08:28.809
Lina, you need to pack.

08:28.811 --> 08:31.779
One cloth.
Things that you can carry.

08:31.781 --> 08:33.746
Just stay in your room and pack.

09:04.681 --> 09:05.914
- Mama.
- Don't be afraid.

09:18.796 --> 09:19.929
Don't touch me!

09:22.767 --> 09:25.835
Jonas, it's all right.
Don't be afraid.

09:25.837 --> 09:27.370
Don't be afraid.

10:08.982 --> 10:11.082
You are the wife
of Kostas Vilkas?

10:11.084 --> 10:12.884
Yes.

10:12.886 --> 10:15.052
Do you know where he is?

10:15.054 --> 10:17.189
I meant to ask you the same.

10:17.191 --> 10:19.458
They have him already.

10:19.460 --> 10:20.992
They're going to
kill all of us.

10:20.994 --> 10:22.096
Quiet, man.

10:31.038 --> 10:33.438
Don't touch it!

11:05.441 --> 11:07.274
Lina! Mama!

11:07.276 --> 11:08.342
Mama!

12:02.400 --> 12:03.801
Boy or girl?

12:07.438 --> 12:08.507
Girl.

12:10.141 --> 12:11.477
What's her name?

12:24.056 --> 12:25.324
You must feed her.

13:44.339 --> 13:47.042
- How many cars have men on them?
- I don't know.

13:47.976 --> 13:51.312
The last five, maybe.

13:51.314 --> 13:52.946
Can you get to them?

13:52.948 --> 13:55.014
My Papa might be on one of them.

13:55.016 --> 13:57.120
Yours might too. Help me.

13:59.522 --> 14:00.890
It's broad daylight.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.393
There's NKVD all over.

14:05.395 --> 14:07.897
Say you find your Papa,
and then what?

14:08.965 --> 14:11.100
- It's too risky.
- You're afraid.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.202
You're not afraid?

16:21.803 --> 16:24.170
<i>Kaunas Arts,
then off to Palanga.</i>

16:32.314 --> 16:35.150
Palanga! Did you miss me?

19:02.905 --> 19:04.440
You draw very well.

19:12.414 --> 19:14.216
I insist. Please.

19:14.718 --> 19:15.685
Take it.

19:16.786 --> 19:17.987
Thank you.

19:26.796 --> 19:28.565
I know your father.

19:31.534 --> 19:34.337
I lead the music department
at the university.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.440
He's quite the leader.

19:42.445 --> 19:44.247
Do you do landscapes, also?

19:45.549 --> 19:46.951
I draw what I see.

19:51.021 --> 19:52.456
The people...

19:54.792 --> 19:57.695
They must know
what is happening here.

19:58.830 --> 20:01.900
Perhaps with your pen,

20:02.834 --> 20:04.736
and "what you see,"

20:06.104 --> 20:07.606
you can show them.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.670
Is she still sleeping?

21:13.942 --> 21:15.575
She's with God, Ona.

21:15.577 --> 21:17.444
- You must let her go.
- Don't touch her!

23:02.621 --> 23:04.623
She clings tighter and tighter.

23:09.528 --> 23:11.197
She must drop it through.

23:17.971 --> 23:19.472
She won't do it herself.

23:20.173 --> 23:21.607
Can we agree?

23:24.644 --> 23:26.113
For the good of everyone.

24:00.281 --> 24:01.282
Ona.

24:03.585 --> 24:05.284
She's gone now.

24:05.286 --> 24:06.888
She must be on her way.

24:09.758 --> 24:10.892
She's with God now.

24:17.933 --> 24:19.001
It's okay.

24:20.269 --> 24:21.771
It's all right.

24:23.906 --> 24:24.907
Okay.

24:26.375 --> 24:27.910
It's all right.

24:30.613 --> 24:32.681
No!

24:36.952 --> 24:38.086
Ona...

24:42.758 --> 24:44.593
It's okay.

25:04.748 --> 25:05.782
It's okay.

25:25.670 --> 25:26.871
Know what this is?

25:30.008 --> 25:33.378
Have you heard the story
of Jurate and Kastytis?

25:37.716 --> 25:39.718
Jurate was queen of the sea.

25:41.120 --> 25:45.188
And she lived at the bottom
of the Baltic,

25:45.190 --> 25:47.659
in a castle made of amber.

25:49.795 --> 25:52.332
Then one day,
she spotted a young fisherman

25:53.266 --> 25:54.831
named Kastytis.

25:54.833 --> 25:56.635
And he caught all of the fish.

25:58.872 --> 26:03.441
Now at first,
this angered Jurate,

26:03.443 --> 26:05.812
but soon, she and Kastytis
fell in love.

26:06.980 --> 26:08.846
And they lived happily,

26:08.848 --> 26:10.251
in the amber castle.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.387
Until, one day,

26:14.355 --> 26:15.722
Perkunas,

26:16.823 --> 26:18.457
the god of thunder,

26:18.459 --> 26:20.826
found out Jurate loved
a mortal man.

26:20.828 --> 26:23.097
And, in a fit of rage,

26:24.165 --> 26:25.898
he destroyed the castle

26:25.900 --> 26:27.835
with a bolt of lightning.

26:28.269 --> 26:30.836
Shattering it

26:30.838 --> 26:32.273
into a million pieces.

26:34.875 --> 26:36.942
Over time,

26:36.944 --> 26:40.380
pieces of the amber
have washed ashore. And...

26:40.382 --> 26:41.682
if you find one,

26:42.884 --> 26:44.319
it will bring you luck.

26:49.357 --> 26:50.392
You keep that.

26:51.927 --> 26:53.261
What happened to them?

26:55.163 --> 26:57.398
I know this story.

26:57.400 --> 27:01.000
Perkunas chained Kastytis
to the ocean floor.

27:01.002 --> 27:04.305
He died,
leaving Jurate heartbroken.

27:04.307 --> 27:06.207
She stills mourns him
to this day,

27:06.209 --> 27:08.377
and that's why the sea wails
like it does.

27:10.046 --> 27:13.214
Some say they made their way
to the shore,

27:13.216 --> 27:14.850
like the amber.

27:15.785 --> 27:18.354
And started a new life together

27:19.389 --> 27:20.790
in Palanga.

29:01.895 --> 29:03.262
Ona!

29:04.965 --> 29:07.132
No, no. No, my baby!

29:07.134 --> 29:09.170
No, my baby!

29:21.283 --> 29:23.082
My baby.

29:23.084 --> 29:24.319
Where is your baby?

29:25.420 --> 29:26.519
No.

29:26.521 --> 29:28.390
Please.

29:31.026 --> 29:34.594
Come up. Yes, yes. Come up.

29:34.596 --> 29:36.965
Let's go find your baby.

29:38.934 --> 29:40.434
Let's find the baby.

29:40.436 --> 29:42.070
- My baby.
- Yes.

29:44.440 --> 29:45.608
She's back there.

29:47.610 --> 29:48.611
What is her name?

29:50.213 --> 29:51.345
Her name is...

30:23.313 --> 30:24.515
Do as he says.

30:25.482 --> 30:26.984
We must bathe.

31:01.353 --> 31:03.487
<i>Are we going
to swim or what?</i>

31:03.489 --> 31:05.222
<i>We didn't bring
our bathing suits.</i>

31:07.059 --> 31:08.659
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Not coming?</i>

31:08.661 --> 31:09.660
The water is warm!

31:09.662 --> 31:12.262
Have fun by yourself
on the beach!

31:13.466 --> 31:16.101
Have fun explaining
where your clothes went!

31:17.069 --> 31:18.703
Hey! Those are mine!

31:18.705 --> 31:19.706
Hey!

31:22.476 --> 31:23.510
Come back!

31:24.444 --> 31:25.445
Hey!

31:26.980 --> 31:29.015
Where do you think
you're going with those?

31:29.282 --> 31:30.283
Sorry.

31:32.519 --> 31:34.020
You have beautiful eyes.

31:35.522 --> 31:36.657
You're naked.

31:52.707 --> 31:57.142
You are all guilty of treason.

31:57.144 --> 31:59.080
A crime punishable by death.

32:00.314 --> 32:03.450
Instead, you will each receive

32:03.452 --> 32:05.552
a life sentence of labor.

32:05.554 --> 32:08.187
Simply put, if you do not work,

32:08.189 --> 32:10.089
you will not eat.

32:10.091 --> 32:12.659
Attempts at escape
are punishable by death,

32:12.661 --> 32:14.261
but I assure you,

32:14.263 --> 32:18.200
the attempt itself
means death in this region.

32:23.205 --> 32:25.073
A signed confession

32:26.476 --> 32:28.609
will yield a reduced sentence

32:28.611 --> 32:30.478
to 25 years.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.683
After which you will receive
full amnesty.

32:35.652 --> 32:38.352
Upon signing,
you will also receive

32:38.354 --> 32:40.488
access to an NKVD trade post.

32:40.490 --> 32:42.356
If you sign,
you betray yourself.

32:42.358 --> 32:44.193
There's nothing to confess.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.269
I have nothing but time.

35:24.694 --> 35:26.061
What is she saying?

35:26.063 --> 35:28.396
She's saying
that we're criminals.

35:28.398 --> 35:30.366
And that
she doesn't want us here.

36:48.816 --> 36:50.349
I have some news for you.

36:52.786 --> 36:54.755
The boy, Andrius,

36:55.789 --> 36:57.457
he was caught stealing food.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.994
Do you know where he is?

37:01.996 --> 37:04.563
They bound him to a post
outside the officer's building,

37:04.565 --> 37:06.165
and beat him.

37:06.167 --> 37:08.002
But he's strong
and withstood it.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.480
Andrius.

38:56.548 --> 38:57.582
Andrius.

38:59.651 --> 39:00.954
Here. Come on.

40:16.098 --> 40:17.264
Kretzsky.

40:44.995 --> 40:48.031
What do you think of Kretzsky?

40:49.166 --> 40:52.334
Hm? Handsome young man,

40:52.336 --> 40:54.871
innocent face, like an angel.

40:55.939 --> 40:57.075
And still...

40:58.675 --> 41:01.077
...if I snap my fingers,

41:01.079 --> 41:03.580
he becomes the angel of death.

41:20.798 --> 41:22.034
You read Russian.

41:22.767 --> 41:24.034
No.

41:24.036 --> 41:25.971
It's not a question.
I know you do.

41:27.272 --> 41:30.674
There is a post office
in Turaciak.

41:30.676 --> 41:33.376
Its function is essential
to our camp.

41:33.378 --> 41:35.912
I am offering you a position.

41:35.914 --> 41:38.617
Translating. Out of the fields,

41:40.286 --> 41:41.687
into the warmth.

41:44.823 --> 41:45.624
No.

41:56.803 --> 41:58.204
You don't fail to amuse,

41:59.706 --> 42:01.040
Elena Vilkas.

42:02.275 --> 42:03.676
So bold.

42:04.911 --> 42:06.844
So defiant.

42:06.846 --> 42:09.150
Just like your husband was.

42:33.275 --> 42:34.442
I know.

42:35.043 --> 42:36.144
The pain.

42:42.384 --> 42:45.084
It belongs to those left behind,

42:45.086 --> 42:46.288
doesn't it?

43:37.375 --> 43:40.543
Have you been
to the trading post?

43:40.545 --> 43:41.644
Are there people
passing through?

43:41.646 --> 43:44.349
What difference does it make
with nothing to trade?

43:48.419 --> 43:49.753
Take something for me.

43:52.090 --> 43:54.090
If you hand this
to someone,

43:54.092 --> 43:56.926
and it finds a way to my Papa,
we may all be saved.

43:56.928 --> 43:58.828
His name is on the back.

43:58.830 --> 44:00.397
If someone were to take it,
and you told them to...

44:00.399 --> 44:01.933
Get that away from me!

44:02.934 --> 44:04.802
You stay away from me!

44:06.838 --> 44:08.107
I'll report you!

44:44.944 --> 44:46.980
Tell them we went for a walk.

44:57.425 --> 45:00.261
When I get back to Kaunas,
I'm joining the partisans.

45:01.962 --> 45:04.096
One day, people in Kaunas
will know my name

45:04.098 --> 45:05.433
like they know your Papa's.

45:07.068 --> 45:08.269
What do you mean?

45:10.171 --> 45:12.104
I know he's helped
a lot of people.

45:12.106 --> 45:14.973
Ah, there you are.

45:14.975 --> 45:17.978
Where is Joana and, uh,
the other boy?

45:19.281 --> 45:20.848
They went for a walk.

45:21.916 --> 45:23.683
Oh, I see. "A walk."

45:25.387 --> 45:27.220
There's dessert inside, you two.

45:27.222 --> 45:28.323
Thank you.

45:41.002 --> 45:41.970
Andrius.

45:44.005 --> 45:45.308
Are you okay?

45:47.677 --> 45:49.112
I brought some food.

45:51.681 --> 45:54.283
There's enough to share
with your mama and Jonas.

45:56.587 --> 45:58.589
And some things just for you.

45:59.723 --> 46:01.991
Some paper and pencils.

46:03.227 --> 46:04.328
Thank you.

46:05.362 --> 46:06.430
Stay there.

46:11.468 --> 46:13.468
It's amazing.

46:13.470 --> 46:15.172
Where did you learn to do this?

46:16.741 --> 46:18.308
- Art school?
- No.

46:20.077 --> 46:21.646
No, but I plan to go.

46:22.514 --> 46:23.548
Look.

46:26.718 --> 46:28.618
Admissions Office.

46:28.620 --> 46:30.921
I'm going to open it
with my Papa.

46:36.995 --> 46:38.394
I think you got in.

46:44.135 --> 46:46.035
And if you didn't,

46:46.037 --> 46:47.406
it's their mistake.

46:50.609 --> 46:53.009
You're brilliant.

46:53.011 --> 46:56.046
You shouldn't use your words
so lightly.

46:56.048 --> 46:57.450
I don't use them lightly.

47:07.126 --> 47:10.162
Um, we shouldn't be out
this late together.

47:11.531 --> 47:12.965
I, I should go.

47:15.268 --> 47:17.102
I'll come by another night?

47:18.472 --> 47:19.473
Okay.

47:21.141 --> 47:22.407
Do you want me to?

47:22.409 --> 47:23.443
Yes.

47:24.311 --> 47:25.345
If you want.

47:44.098 --> 47:45.099
Here.

47:52.708 --> 47:54.108
Do you like him?

47:56.645 --> 47:59.280
From the way you look
at this drawing.

48:02.216 --> 48:05.052
It's how a felt
when I first met your papa.

48:07.789 --> 48:10.158
Do you think Papa
is looking for us?

48:12.094 --> 48:13.595
Of course, he is.

48:41.659 --> 48:43.559
It's underweight.

48:43.561 --> 48:45.228
He's asking why.

49:44.690 --> 49:46.258
You are shaking.

49:52.598 --> 49:54.264
Cold?

49:54.266 --> 49:56.202
Hm?

50:15.455 --> 50:18.256
I needed something
to trade in the village.

50:18.258 --> 50:20.260
What's the point
if there's nothing to trade?

50:22.229 --> 50:24.229
She has a map!

50:24.231 --> 50:26.501
She showed me
her plans to escape.

51:31.502 --> 51:32.768
No. No...

52:10.675 --> 52:11.778
Hm.

53:20.715 --> 53:21.816
Pull the...

54:31.957 --> 54:33.758
Where did you find
the materials?

54:37.829 --> 54:40.565
Perhaps someone stole them
for you?

54:42.601 --> 54:43.602
Hm?

54:48.540 --> 54:49.574
Very good.

54:55.580 --> 54:56.615
So,

54:57.716 --> 54:59.518
you draw portraits.

55:17.204 --> 55:19.739
I sit here before you,

55:21.976 --> 55:23.210
you draw me.

55:32.686 --> 55:33.721
Draw me.

57:14.293 --> 57:15.593
All done?

57:16.794 --> 57:17.795
Let's see.

57:57.137 --> 57:58.705
The next Van Gogh.

58:38.780 --> 58:40.048
Um, stop!

59:42.914 --> 59:44.482
Merry Christmas.

59:45.850 --> 59:46.884
Look inside.

59:54.993 --> 59:56.892
Your drawing of Papa.

59:56.894 --> 59:58.961
It flew out of the fire.

59:58.963 --> 01:00:00.832
I found it in the snow.

01:00:10.476 --> 01:00:11.977
Thank you, Jonas.

01:02:01.991 --> 01:02:02.793
Andrius!

01:02:05.562 --> 01:02:07.629
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:02:17.975 --> 01:02:20.311
- Thank you, Andrius.
- Merry Christmas.

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:22.347
A book?

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:24.547
It's in Russian,

01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:27.150
so maybe your mama
can help you read it.

01:02:27.152 --> 01:02:29.352
Thank you.

01:02:29.354 --> 01:02:32.357
I had something for you, too,
but they burned all my drawings.

01:02:33.658 --> 01:02:35.057
It's all right.

01:02:35.059 --> 01:02:36.094
It's okay.

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.129
I'll draw more.

01:03:09.529 --> 01:03:10.564
Good night.

01:03:13.032 --> 01:03:14.034
Good night.

01:10:54.013 --> 01:10:55.014
Andrius!

01:10:55.715 --> 01:10:56.716
Andrius!

01:10:57.549 --> 01:10:58.517
Lina.

01:11:00.086 --> 01:11:01.087
Lina!

01:11:03.589 --> 01:11:05.222
When this is...
When this is over,

01:11:05.224 --> 01:11:06.991
I'll find you. Don't give up!

01:11:06.993 --> 01:11:09.026
- No!
- Look after Jonas!

01:11:09.028 --> 01:11:10.630
- He needs you!
- Stop!

01:11:11.965 --> 01:11:13.698
Stop, please!

01:11:14.969 --> 01:11:16.701
- Lina!
- Andrius!

01:11:16.703 --> 01:11:18.837
- Lina!
- No!

01:11:18.839 --> 01:11:20.207
- Lina!
- Please!

01:13:17.062 --> 01:13:18.163
Mama!

01:13:41.054 --> 01:13:43.089
Mama! Ma, Mama!

01:13:43.923 --> 01:13:44.989
Mama.

01:13:44.991 --> 01:13:46.726
Mama!

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:08.042
Elena. Elena.

01:15:11.348 --> 01:15:12.848
You need to rest.

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:48.987
There's a ship.

01:15:50.922 --> 01:15:52.857
It leaves the day
after tomorrow.

01:15:54.426 --> 01:15:57.394
It's the last one of the season.
After that,

01:15:57.396 --> 01:15:58.763
no more in or out.

01:16:01.233 --> 01:16:02.767
I'm going to be on it.

01:16:04.403 --> 01:16:06.405
You and your brother
could be, too.

01:16:11.143 --> 01:16:12.876
Come or don't.

01:16:12.878 --> 01:16:14.980
Everything here will die
come winter.

01:21:11.556 --> 01:21:13.325
Mama...

01:23:35.406 --> 01:23:36.507
Mama.

01:23:39.711 --> 01:23:42.279
Mama, you must eat.

01:23:56.828 --> 01:23:59.498
You're so much like your Papa.

01:24:04.036 --> 01:24:05.403
Passionate.

01:24:06.906 --> 01:24:08.708
Full of hope.

01:24:15.414 --> 01:24:17.717
When they see what you see,

01:24:18.718 --> 01:24:20.419
they feel it, too.

01:24:31.364 --> 01:24:34.368
There is something
I have to tell you, Lina.

01:24:38.372 --> 01:24:42.709
Something I kept from you
like I kept so many things.

01:24:44.478 --> 01:24:46.480
Hoping I was protecting you.

01:24:50.551 --> 01:24:52.053
I'm sorry, Lina.

01:24:54.421 --> 01:24:56.024
I'm very sorry.

01:25:00.528 --> 01:25:01.663
Your Papa...

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:12.672
He was...

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:14.409
He was shot, Lina.

01:25:18.981 --> 01:25:21.917
He helped hundreds.

01:25:23.419 --> 01:25:24.653
Your cousin,

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:26.989
and our family.

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:32.361
You must remember what he did.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.002
You must remember.

01:25:43.473 --> 01:25:45.108
You'll tell Jonas...

01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:48.778
when the time is right.

01:25:52.782 --> 01:25:54.417
Trust yourself.

01:25:58.956 --> 01:26:00.825
You are a leader

01:26:02.492 --> 01:26:04.028
like your Papa.

01:26:36.528 --> 01:26:37.529
Mama.

01:26:40.666 --> 01:26:42.901
Mama, open... Open this with me.

01:27:02.588 --> 01:27:03.756
Mama.

01:27:06.526 --> 01:27:08.494
Mama? Mama?

01:32:51.586 --> 01:32:53.886
<i>Jurate was queen of the sea.</i>

01:32:53.888 --> 01:32:56.989
<i>She lived at the bottom
of the Baltic,</i>

01:32:56.991 --> 01:32:59.060
<i>in a castle made of amber.</i>

01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:03.465
<i>Then one day,
spotted a young fisherman</i>

01:33:04.633 --> 01:33:06.068
<i>named Kastytis.</i>

01:33:07.569 --> 01:33:09.838
<i>Soon, she and Kastytis
fell in love.</i>

01:33:13.041 --> 01:33:14.509
<i>Until one day,</i>

01:33:16.144 --> 01:33:17.212
<i>Perkunas,</i>

01:33:18.313 --> 01:33:20.180
<i>the god of thunder,</i>

01:33:20.182 --> 01:33:22.550
<i>found out Jurate
loved a mortal man.</i>

01:33:22.552 --> 01:33:25.486
<i>And, in a fit of rage,</i>

01:33:25.488 --> 01:33:26.922
<i>he destroyed the castle.</i>

01:33:28.491 --> 01:33:30.026
<i>What happened to them?</i>

01:33:32.528 --> 01:33:35.031
<i>There are variations
to the ending.</i>

01:33:37.634 --> 01:33:40.502
<i>Some say they made their way
to the shore,</i>

01:33:40.504 --> 01:33:42.004
<i>like the amber.</i>

01:33:42.972 --> 01:33:46.042
<i>And started a new life together</i>

01:33:47.043 --> 01:33:47.977
<i>in Palanga.</i>
