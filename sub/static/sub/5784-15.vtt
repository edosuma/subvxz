(theme music)

00:45.111 --> 00:48.981
(man panting)

01:01.661 --> 01:03.762
(man screaming)
What a way to die,

01:03.764 --> 01:06.899
mauled to death--
Henry...

01:06.901 --> 01:08.934
you don't know
that's what happened.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.769
You didn't see it, George.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.905
Those terrible scratches
on his face alone

01:12.907 --> 01:15.507
would let you know if you did.
Sir.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.611
What have you, George?

01:19.613 --> 01:21.814
Sir, the man who discovered
him was checking

01:21.816 --> 01:23.849
his snares this morning.
He seemed surprised,

01:23.851 --> 01:27.086
almost disappointed to find out
he'd snagged a human.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.288
I suppose he was
expecting his dinner.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.657
Right. Have him come down
to the Station House for a word.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.725
Do we know
the victim's identity yet?

01:33.727 --> 01:36.161
He has nothing on his person,
sir. We searched the area

01:36.163 --> 01:39.531
for his wallet, no luck.
Judging by the scratches

01:39.533 --> 01:41.366
on his face, I'd say
he was attacked by an animal

01:41.368 --> 01:43.769
of some kind.
Higgins has a theory, sir.

01:43.771 --> 01:47.206
Uh, George...
Does it pertain to this case?

01:47.208 --> 01:49.208
He certainly thinks it does,
he hasn't shut up about it.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.943
(Higgins sighs.)

01:50.945 --> 01:52.511
Henry?

01:54.347 --> 01:56.315
Sir, it's like a...

01:56.317 --> 01:58.317
I only saw it for a minute.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.785
Saw what?

01:59.787 --> 02:03.455
You better
follow me, sir.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.724
This way.

02:08.995 --> 02:11.263
♪
I warn you, sir,

02:11.265 --> 02:14.333
it's not a pretty sight.
I'll prepare myself.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.236
You may want to keep
your distance as well.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.278
(girl grunting)

02:26.280 --> 02:28.480
Stay back, sir.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.483
It may look harmless,
but I've seen that thing

02:31.485 --> 02:34.186
kill and eat a live chicken
with my own eyes.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.021
Really?

02:36.023 --> 02:38.023
Look no further, sir.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.659
It's your killer.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.069
(grunting)

02:51.071 --> 02:53.105
How do you know
about this, Henry?

02:53.107 --> 02:56.775
Well, I paid to see it, sir.
Ten cents, but it was worth it.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.845
From the shores of Borneo, sir.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.414
Could have been the mountains,
I don't recall exactly, sir,

03:02.416 --> 03:04.449
but someplace--
Who cares for her?!

03:04.451 --> 03:06.852
Well, a keeper.
He collects the money.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.288
I don't know,
she hardly seems to be--

03:09.290 --> 03:11.290
What the hell
are you two doing in here?

03:11.292 --> 03:13.358
Show's not open
for another hour.

03:15.628 --> 03:18.230
Detective Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

03:18.232 --> 03:21.567
But you still have to pay.
Ten cents each you owe me.

03:21.569 --> 03:25.037
I've paid once already.
He hasn't--

03:25.039 --> 03:27.573
Who are you?
Mick Travis.

03:27.575 --> 03:30.976
And this is my property,
so police

03:30.978 --> 03:32.811
or no police,
you're trespassing.

03:32.813 --> 03:36.048
Now what do you want?
A man was killed last night

03:36.050 --> 03:38.584
not half a mile from here.
Where were you?

03:38.586 --> 03:41.220
"Where were you?"
Don't you be

03:41.222 --> 03:43.755
flimflamming with
your penny-ante questions.

03:43.757 --> 03:47.292
You're not interested
in where "I" was.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.394
Very well.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.331
Where was she?
She was locked up all night

03:52.333 --> 03:54.833
and nowhere near your dead man.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.668
(Murdoch): And why do you
keep her caged?

03:56.670 --> 03:59.771
To keep her safe.
It's in her own best interest.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.407
And charging admission
to view her in a cage,

04:02.409 --> 04:04.643
is that also
in her best interest?

04:04.645 --> 04:06.845
She's... paying her keep.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.914
Mr. Travis, is it?
Aye.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.616
You're coming with us
to the Station House.

04:10.618 --> 04:13.318
I have no reason to.
Do I have to arrest you?

04:13.320 --> 04:15.187
Come on!
Don't lay your hands on me.

04:15.189 --> 04:18.523
(girl grunting)
I'm doing nothing
the law says I can't!

04:20.159 --> 04:24.196
Unlawful confinement
of a person or persons.

04:24.198 --> 04:26.198
You're coming with us.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.034
I finished my anatomy report
on the unclaimed bank robber.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.003
Mrs. Braxton?
Yes.

04:31.005 --> 04:33.338
I appreciated
the opportunity, Dr. Ogden.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.707
Well, if you put
what you learn to good use,

04:35.709 --> 04:38.277
her unfortunate death
will not be for nothing.

04:38.279 --> 04:41.413
I trust that she offered
some challenges.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.448
Yes, she did.

04:43.450 --> 04:47.819
Good. Now we can give
Roland's mother a proper burial.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.355
Thank you, gentlemen.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.391
So what did you glean?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.130
Surely there was something.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.399
There was indeed, Dr. Ogden.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.468
Mrs. Braxton was not
a full woman.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.003
Meaning?

05:05.005 --> 05:06.872
She had no ovaries.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.741
She was born without
a complete reproductive system.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.644
She couldn't
bear children?

05:12.646 --> 05:16.348
Whoever she is,
she isn't your baby's mother.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.386
Who is this girl
that you keep locked up?

05:21.388 --> 05:24.323
And don't give me
that story about Borneo.

05:24.325 --> 05:28.093
I... came across her
in the Appalachian Mountains

05:28.095 --> 05:30.062
some ten years ago.

05:30.064 --> 05:32.064
Well, she came across me,
more like.

05:32.066 --> 05:33.832
How so?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.834
I was asleep in the caravan
when I heard

05:35.836 --> 05:38.570
something rummaging
around my campfire.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.739
In the darkness,
I thought it was a bear

05:40.741 --> 05:43.175
and almost shot it.
Where did she come from?

05:43.177 --> 05:45.010
No idea.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.113
You ask me, she was
raised by wolves.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.882
Highly unlikely.
Sir, she's as wild

05:50.884 --> 05:52.918
as the day
is long, mister.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.220
So, you keep her caged
like a beast.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.622
Look, she's clothed and fed

05:57.624 --> 06:00.392
and in a better state
than when I found her.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.394
And before you start,
she's legally mine.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.396
I have the paper to prove it.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.131
There you go.

06:06.133 --> 06:09.434
Named her Fen
for the record.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.436
Check for yourself.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.438
And she's happy
where she is.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.607
I very much doubt that.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.677
There's no force
the way I handle her.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.612
She's content

06:20.614 --> 06:23.215
as long as she gets fed.
So no law broken.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.684
See for yourself.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.853
I've nothing to hide.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.427
Do you know this man?

06:35.429 --> 06:38.296
Never clapped eyes on him.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.299
I had to stop myself
from throttling the man

06:41.301 --> 06:44.102
who keeps her. I had neither
the ability to arrest him

06:44.104 --> 06:47.506
or to rescue her.
She is his legal property.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.474
That's appalling!

06:49.476 --> 06:52.944
A man is allowed to exhibit
a young girl in a cage,

06:52.946 --> 06:54.946
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.748
(Julia sighing)

06:56.750 --> 06:59.451
What of our victim's body?

06:59.453 --> 07:01.953
His wounds
were mostly superficial,

07:01.955 --> 07:04.523
the most pronounced
being facial lacerations.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.459
He was gouged,
likely by claws or nails.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.294
And this.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.296
A deep bite
on his right hand.

07:11.298 --> 07:15.133
The wounds were made
with pointed incisor teeth.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.302
So likely
an animal attack then?

07:17.304 --> 07:20.839
That would have been
my conclusion if not for the
stab wound in his upper back.

07:20.841 --> 07:24.943
The thrust was a downward
motion, but not a fatal blow.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.446
Then how did he die?
He bled to death.

07:27.448 --> 07:30.215
If he hadn't been trapped,
he may have survived.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.885
What time would he
have been stabbed?
I couldn't say.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.621
I only know that he died
between 2 and 4 in the morning.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.658
He may have been in the snare
for hours afterwards.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.327
That or that he was attacked
while in the snare.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.496
By this feral child?

07:44.498 --> 07:48.133
No, she was inside a cage
at the time of the murder.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.969
William, I'd be most
interested in examining her

07:50.971 --> 07:52.637
if it would help.
Of course.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.940
Thank you, Julia.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.876
Oh, I spoke with the nanny
at the hotel,

07:57.878 --> 08:01.046
and she assures me
that Roland is fine.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.748
I know you were concerned about
leaving him with a stranger.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.650
She'd let us know
if he needs us?

08:05.652 --> 08:08.487
Of course. Of course.

08:16.596 --> 08:18.964
And the animal bones
that I saw in her cage, George,

08:18.966 --> 08:21.500
some of them are too big
to be from chickens.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.002
She may be eating
cats and dogs even.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.605
Maybe even a goat?
Could be a small goat, Henry.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.640
You know, you joke,
but the keeper told us

08:28.642 --> 08:30.642
she fought off a wolf
when she was 7 years old.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.611
She has a nasty scar
on her arm to prove it.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.746
These would be the wolves
that raised her, I assume.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.748
Don't be so ridiculous,
George,

08:36.750 --> 08:38.950
it wouldn't be
the same wolves.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.952
The attack likely came
from a rival pack.

08:40.954 --> 08:44.556
Henry, let's get
to work. Right?

08:44.558 --> 08:47.125
What were you hoping
to catch, Mr. Hewitt?

08:47.127 --> 08:50.228
Well, it wasn't a man,
I can tell you that.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.231
You see, something is killing
livestock at my farm.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.601
I reckoned whatever it is roams
the ravine and I aimed
to catch it.

08:56.603 --> 08:59.337
Your farm is near where
you set the snare, correct?

08:59.339 --> 09:01.806
Yes.
Were you home that night?

09:01.808 --> 09:04.042
Did you not hear
a man cry out?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.611
Well, I heard noises,
but I thought it was the animal

09:06.613 --> 09:09.247
I was looking to catch.
I didn't know it was human

09:09.249 --> 09:12.551
until I checked the snare
this morning. God rest his soul.

09:24.830 --> 09:27.098
(woman): My detective agency
is at your disposal.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.268
I appreciate that, Miss Pink.
How can I help?

09:30.270 --> 09:32.737
I have just learned
some distressing news

09:32.739 --> 09:34.773
about the baby
William and I adopted.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.675
Well, about
his deceased mother actually.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.610
What is it?

09:38.612 --> 09:41.379
She wasn't born with
a complete reproductive system.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.949
She couldn't have been
Roland's natural mother.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.418
Well, that must have been
a bolt out of the blue.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.955
It never occurred to either
of us to question his parentage.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.257
And what do you
want me to do?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.993
Find out if
his natural mother is alive.

09:54.995 --> 09:58.363
Can I ask for your discretion?
Absolutely.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.733
What do you know about
the mother and her husband?

10:01.735 --> 10:03.668
Not much.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.438
Nigel Braxton was
a safecracker from England.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.975
His wife, Joanne, was
from Stratford, Ontario.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.978
I think her maiden name
was Perly.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.879
And they have
no surviving family.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.449
How old is the child?
About 9 months.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.721
Are you sure that
you want to know the truth?

10:22.723 --> 10:24.723
What do you mean?

10:24.725 --> 10:27.459
It's a question
that I ask all of my clients.

10:27.461 --> 10:31.463
What I find out for them isn't
always what they'd hoped for.

10:33.332 --> 10:35.133
At this moment,
I can't say.

10:36.669 --> 10:38.670
I will be in touch.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.972
Thank you.

I came back from the Station
House to set up for the show,

10:50.550 --> 10:53.918
and she was gone.
Has this happened before?

10:53.920 --> 10:56.454
She's never been set free.

10:56.456 --> 10:59.257
I don't know
what she's capable of.

10:59.259 --> 11:02.861
This lock, it's faulty.
Did you not notice?

11:02.863 --> 11:05.397
Sure if I noticed, I would
have fixed it, wouldn't I?

11:05.399 --> 11:08.299
This means the girl
could have gotten out

11:31.925 --> 11:33.925
Having said that, be cautious.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.994
This girl could be vicious.

Crabtree, bring the lads
up to speed.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.450
I'm joining the search
for the missing young woman.

11:58.452 --> 12:00.819
You think she could be
the killer?

12:00.821 --> 12:04.055
I don't know, but I'd rather
a mob didn't decide.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.592
Still have no idea who she is?
No.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.828
But in spite
of Mr. Travis' claims,

12:09.830 --> 12:11.830
she wasn't always feral.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.932
At the very least,
she had a mother who gave

12:13.934 --> 12:16.868
birth to her.
Yes, she did.

12:23.609 --> 12:25.610
Are we ready, men?
(farmers): Ready!

12:25.612 --> 12:28.680
I say we shoot whatever it is
and ask the questions after!

12:28.682 --> 12:30.682
(farmers cheering)
You pull a stunt like that

12:30.684 --> 12:33.084
and it'd be murder.
I'll personally see to it

12:33.086 --> 12:35.420
that you all bloody hang for it,
no matter who pulls the trigger.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.923
She killed a man
and won't get away with
it as long as I'm standing.

12:38.925 --> 12:42.260
Night will fall soon, that's
when she's likely to move.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.262
Ready the torches!

12:44.264 --> 12:46.831
You'll not be readying
anything until I say so, got it?

12:46.833 --> 12:48.466
Right then.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.368
Each of you will pair up
with a constable.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.670
Crabtree, you talk
to that farmer. You,

12:52.672 --> 12:54.672
stick with me!

12:54.674 --> 12:57.575
♪
(indistinct chatter)

13:02.681 --> 13:05.984
Keep your eyes open!
Yes. Do you see that trail?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.986
Ah, George, there you are!

13:07.988 --> 13:09.954
Sir.
I need you to come with me.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.123
The girl, Fen,
she's likely to flee

13:12.125 --> 13:14.359
from the light
of the torches.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.028
But then, sir,
how will we see?

13:17.030 --> 13:19.531
With these.
Good gracious!

13:19.533 --> 13:22.233
Now, George, if you were
trying to get away,

13:22.235 --> 13:25.436
which direction
would you be likely to go in?

13:25.438 --> 13:28.706
Sir, I would follow the river.
Exactly.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.678
(door closing)

13:33.680 --> 13:36.347
So you have something?

13:36.349 --> 13:39.651
Not yet. I need more
information on Roland.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.653
Any physical details

13:41.655 --> 13:43.521
that may help
to identify him?

13:43.523 --> 13:45.790
There's nothing.

13:45.792 --> 13:48.860
He's completely perfect.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.629
Freddie, now that you're here,
I've been thinking...

13:51.631 --> 13:54.265
Yes?

13:54.267 --> 13:56.201
If Roland's parents
were looking for him,

13:56.203 --> 13:58.203
surely they would have
informed the Constabulary.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.371
Maybe so.

14:00.373 --> 14:04.375
Perhaps... they don't care.

14:04.377 --> 14:07.645
You're having
second thoughts.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.515
You asked if I wanted
to know the truth...

14:10.517 --> 14:13.218
perhaps not knowing
is the best course.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.254
You wouldn't be the first of
my clients to change their mind.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.556
No father could be
better than William.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.726
He loves the boy.
He truly is his son.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.362
And you, Julia?

14:24.364 --> 14:27.365
I can't bear the thought
of not having Roland.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.267
Well then it's settled.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.603
He couldn't have
better parents,

14:31.605 --> 14:33.805
you must never
question that.

14:36.575 --> 14:38.943
(Julia sighs.)

14:38.945 --> 14:41.846
I'm gonna take this way!
Come on, over here!

14:41.848 --> 14:43.548
I've got nothing!
Help me!

14:43.550 --> 14:45.550
Nothing that way!

14:45.552 --> 14:49.053
Look. Over there!

14:49.055 --> 14:51.222
It won't get away
this time!

14:51.224 --> 14:53.758
Everyone, stay close.
It's over here! Come on!

14:53.760 --> 14:56.561
Keep up with them! Go! Go!

14:56.563 --> 14:58.997
Move it!
Alright, alright, I see it!

14:58.999 --> 15:00.732
There! There!

15:00.734 --> 15:03.835
Oh! Ugh! Ugh!
(Hewitt): Get it! Get it!

15:03.837 --> 15:05.637
Hewitt, get back!

15:05.639 --> 15:08.406
No! Don't hurt me, please!
Dead or alive!

15:08.408 --> 15:10.141
Please!

15:10.143 --> 15:13.845
He's no more
of a beast than I am.

15:13.847 --> 15:16.514
Let's leave
the man in peace.

♪

15:18.518 --> 15:20.518
Can you see
alright, George?

15:20.520 --> 15:23.154
Sir, as clear as day.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.123
Ugh! Argh! Well, not...

15:25.125 --> 15:27.091
quite as clear as day,
but I can see.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.294
I can see.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.296
Shhh!
What is it?

15:31.298 --> 15:35.033
It's Mr. Travis.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.801
Looking for his girl,
no doubt.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.170
That's the thing, George.

15:39.172 --> 15:42.974
He's quite purposefully
walking the opposite direction,

15:42.976 --> 15:46.444
towards his campsite.
That's odd for sure.

15:48.213 --> 15:51.382
I'll follow him, George.
You keep going along the river.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.384
That's the direction
he just came from.

Well done, George.
You're alright?

I think so, sir.

(girl grunting)

17:12.599 --> 17:14.665
She's tethered!

17:16.535 --> 17:19.037
Someone is hiding her here.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.972
Travis most likely, sir.

17:20.974 --> 17:24.776
Alright. You must have
stumbled upon her lair.

17:24.778 --> 17:28.012
You approached her. She felt
threatened, so she attacked you.

17:29.948 --> 17:31.916
Should I bring her back
to the cells?

17:31.918 --> 17:33.951
No, no.

17:33.953 --> 17:37.055
The Toronto Asylum under
Dr. Ogden's care will be best.

17:37.057 --> 17:41.125
Right. Do you think
she's the killer, sir?

17:41.127 --> 17:44.228
Certainly seems
capable of it.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.998
I'd have to agree.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.434
Alright.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.302
(Fen grunting)

17:51.304 --> 17:54.405
Fen, I'm going to put you
to sleep for a little while.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.499
My goodness!

18:21.501 --> 18:24.268
Hard to believe
it's the same girl.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.337
Her persona was
very much exaggerated.

18:26.339 --> 18:29.707
Her hair and
body unwashed...

18:29.709 --> 18:32.210
That's quite a scar.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.112
Yes. From an animal attack

18:34.114 --> 18:37.348
some years ago.
Mr. Travis claims

18:37.350 --> 18:40.618
that she was mauled by a wolf.
It's quite possible,

18:40.620 --> 18:43.154
William. Her teeth

18:43.156 --> 18:46.457
have been deliberately
filed down into points.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.493
I took an impression.

18:48.495 --> 18:52.029
It matches
our victim's bite mark.

18:58.937 --> 19:01.172
I'd be worried
about that, George.

19:01.174 --> 19:04.475
Dr. Ogden looked at it,
she says it's healing nicely.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.511
It does hurt like
the Devil though.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.147
Maybe you caught something.
Something?!

19:09.149 --> 19:11.015
Rabies?

19:11.017 --> 19:13.451
Henry, she's a girl,
not a dog!

19:13.453 --> 19:15.653
What if she bit a dog
before she bit you?

19:15.655 --> 19:18.556
George, you're not
thinking clearly.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.926
That's a symptom, you know?
Where is he?!

19:21.928 --> 19:24.095
Huh?

19:26.732 --> 19:28.900
You've no right
to keep her!

19:28.902 --> 19:30.868
She's my property,

19:30.870 --> 19:33.070
and I've
a lineup of customers waiting.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.406
Well, then they'll
just have to wait.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.708
But thanks for popping in
because we've got some questions

19:37.710 --> 19:39.744
we'd like to ask you.
What were you doing

19:39.746 --> 19:42.180
in the woods last night?
Looking for the girl.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.182
Why else?
You were not looking for her;

19:44.184 --> 19:46.617
you were hiding her!
Now, why would I do that, huh?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.619
Stop playing the innocent.
You let her out,

19:48.621 --> 19:51.822
tied her up, no doubt waiting
for the perfect opportunity

19:51.824 --> 19:54.358
to go back, get her,
and leave town.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.694
Meanwhile the Constabulary
and half the neighbourhood

19:56.696 --> 19:58.696
are on a wild goose chase
looking for her.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.465
Enough with the lies,
Mr. Travis. What is going on?

20:01.467 --> 20:05.203
You're right. I was leaving.

20:05.205 --> 20:08.472
I wanted to get her
as far away from this town

20:08.474 --> 20:11.108
before you bloodthirsty lot
strung her up

20:11.110 --> 20:12.977
for something
she had nothing to do with.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.613
We have evidence
that she attacked the victim.

20:15.615 --> 20:18.316
Like what?
Her bite mark on his hand.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.318
You call that evidence?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.286
(Travis laughing)

20:22.288 --> 20:24.288
I warn all the spectators
not to get

20:24.290 --> 20:25.990
too close to her cage.

20:25.992 --> 20:30.394
That only proves the man
can't listen to sound advice.

20:30.396 --> 20:33.064
When did the victim see her?
How would I know?

20:33.066 --> 20:36.968
Lots of people come through.
She's quite the attraction.

20:36.970 --> 20:40.771
Now, where you keeping her?

20:40.773 --> 20:42.807
She's in better hands
than yours.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.583
Safe. No one will hurt you.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.972
William.

21:47.974 --> 21:51.008
You're just in time to see
these gestures she's making.

21:51.010 --> 21:54.078
(Fen grunting)
What do they mean?

21:54.080 --> 21:57.315
I have no idea. They require
further observation.

21:57.317 --> 22:01.018
But her appearance,
her choice in food,

22:01.020 --> 22:03.954
the scars; they all suggest
she's been living in the wild

22:03.956 --> 22:07.158
for some time.
Fascinating.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.594
I can understand why people
would want to pay to see her.

22:10.596 --> 22:13.164
Well, Julia,
surely not.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.467
(Julia): What are we doing
but watching her, William?

22:19.171 --> 22:23.007
About time you paid for help.
How much you offering?

22:23.009 --> 22:24.909
Five cents.
Ten.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.445
A nickel, final offer!
What do you know?

22:27.447 --> 22:29.680
I seen him.
Did you now?

22:29.682 --> 22:32.750
He went to see that beast
in the cage.
What of it?

22:32.752 --> 22:34.618
I took him there.
Near the river.

Yes, I'm sure it was.
Give us that nickel back,

Here. You stay
out of trouble, alright?

23:29.975 --> 23:33.077
So, the victim was
definitely attacked here

23:33.079 --> 23:35.679
at Travis's campsite.
Which the lying sod

23:35.681 --> 23:38.749
failed to tell us he moved.
Bloody Irish tinkers!

23:38.751 --> 23:40.751
Nothing but trouble when
they show up in their caravans.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.987
Ten to one that
that knife's the murder weapon.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.022
Not a single fingermark, sir.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.024
There are traces of blood,

23:47.026 --> 23:48.826
but it's been deliberately
wiped clean.

23:48.828 --> 23:51.228
Had to be Travis.
The girl wouldn't have

23:51.230 --> 23:53.164
the wherewithal to do that.
Exactly.

23:53.166 --> 23:55.166
But then, what about
the bite marks?

23:55.168 --> 23:57.968
Well, the victim
got too close to her.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.771
As you discovered, Fen reacts
violently when approached.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.606
Indeed she does.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.176
So the victim and the girl
were involved in an altercation.

24:05.178 --> 24:07.845
Or Travis set her on him.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.014
Either way,
Travis stabbed him

24:10.016 --> 24:12.683
and then tried
to cover it up. But why?

24:12.685 --> 24:15.319
Any news
from the victim, Crabtree?

24:15.321 --> 24:18.055
Nothing yet, sir, but I've
widened my search, sent out

24:18.057 --> 24:20.891
a province-wide description.
Constables.

Come with me,

I've found the killer.

24:27.265 --> 24:29.533
"Constables."

24:34.606 --> 24:37.308
See. I got it.
A vicious coyote.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.343
And he's the killer?
He is indeed.

24:39.345 --> 24:41.879
Ah... So, uh...

24:41.881 --> 24:45.916
explain to me
how he could use that?

24:45.918 --> 24:48.252
♪
(Fen panting)

24:48.254 --> 24:50.788
(indistinct chatter)
(distant woman): Bye-bye!

25:06.605 --> 25:09.406
Julia!

25:12.377 --> 25:15.279
This is a nice surprise.

25:15.281 --> 25:18.082
How are you?
(baby babbling)

25:18.084 --> 25:21.619
I just picked up
our little man and thought
we'd drop by for a visit.

25:21.621 --> 25:24.889
I've been trying
to get Fen interested in food.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.224
She shows a passing interest
in oatmeal.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.593
(Fen grunting)
(Murdoch): Any other changes?

25:29.595 --> 25:31.495
She's still
making the gestures,

25:31.497 --> 25:33.397
but I haven't been able
to decipher any pattern.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.399
It certainly doesn't match

25:35.401 --> 25:37.601
any sign language
that I can find.

25:37.603 --> 25:39.703
(Murdoch): Perhaps it is
just random.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.773
(baby babbling)
Hello, Roland.

25:42.775 --> 25:45.910
Am I ignoring you?
(Julia chuckling)

25:45.912 --> 25:47.912
Oh!
The nanny says that

25:47.914 --> 25:50.314
we are to feed him more often.
Hahaha!

25:50.316 --> 25:54.418
He's hardly underfed, William.
I agree, but she insists.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.654
There. No?

25:56.656 --> 25:58.656
See, you're not

25:58.658 --> 26:01.325
even hungry.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.394
(Fen grunting)

26:03.396 --> 26:05.763
Do you see that, William?

26:05.765 --> 26:08.632
(Fen grunting)

26:08.634 --> 26:11.835
You like the baby?

26:11.837 --> 26:14.271
You want to see
the baby?

26:14.273 --> 26:16.273
(Fen grunting)

26:16.275 --> 26:19.009
I think she's more interested
in you, William.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.344
Pa!

26:20.346 --> 26:23.247
She's speaking.
Paaa! Paa.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.783
After a fashion.
Paa...

26:25.785 --> 26:28.052
Do you think
maybe she recognizes

26:28.054 --> 26:30.721
that I'm Roland's father?

26:33.959 --> 26:35.659
And that's what

26:35.661 --> 26:38.162
all the speaking
and gestures are about?

26:38.164 --> 26:41.198
It seems to be some form
of primitive language.

26:43.134 --> 26:46.570
Pa.
Well, we know she had
a father at some point.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.772
It appears so.

26:51.643 --> 26:54.878
(indistinct conversations)
I've been expecting your call.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.880
You have?

26:56.882 --> 26:58.882
You don't seem the type
of person who's comfortable

26:58.884 --> 27:00.818
with unanswered questions.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.654
I want you to keep looking
for his parents.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.789
Well, in fact,

27:05.791 --> 27:09.360
I've carried on with my search,
anticipating this very thing.

27:09.362 --> 27:12.963
So you have something?

27:12.965 --> 27:15.199
Please tell me
it's not a mother pining

27:15.201 --> 27:17.368
for her lost child.
Not exactly.

27:17.370 --> 27:19.303
After her parents died,

27:19.305 --> 27:22.139
I found out that Joanne Perly
left Stratford.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.141
But the trail
went cold after that.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.077
So I checked
into Mr. Braxton.

27:27.079 --> 27:30.614
It seems he left England for
the bright lights of Brantford.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.883
There, he met
and married Joanne.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.852
How did they get Roland?

27:34.854 --> 27:37.388
The woman I think
was Roland's mother

27:37.390 --> 27:39.723
lived out of town
on a homestead.

27:39.725 --> 27:42.159
She went into labour
earlier than her time.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.928
There were complications,
and she died.

27:44.930 --> 27:46.930
What happened to Roland?

27:46.932 --> 27:49.033
The rural midwife
was the only person present.

27:49.035 --> 27:52.002
She reported that the baby
was never delivered.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.705
The midwife was
Joanne Braxton.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.674
She stole
the dead woman's child?

27:56.676 --> 27:58.676
It's the only birth

27:58.678 --> 28:00.878
she attended that fits
with Roland's age.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.580
And then she and her husband
left the area shortly after.

28:03.582 --> 28:07.284
What about Roland's father?
Is he still alive?

28:07.286 --> 28:09.386
He is.

28:09.388 --> 28:12.790
He was working out
of the province at the
time of his wife's death.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.292
He never questioned
the official report.

28:15.294 --> 28:18.095
My God!

28:20.098 --> 28:22.466
No one knows the baby exists.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.002
No one misses him.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.071
No one mourns him.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.273
He is yours, Julia.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.977
Is this good news or bad?

28:35.747 --> 28:37.748
What would William say?

28:37.750 --> 28:40.284
He still doesn't know.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.422
Keeping a secret
this profound from him

28:45.424 --> 28:47.891
would be a betrayal
of the trust between us.

28:49.828 --> 28:51.829
But if I tell him--

28:51.831 --> 28:53.831
He will feel duty-bound

28:53.833 --> 28:56.066
to return Roland
to his father.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.535
So leaving him
in blissful ignorance

28:58.537 --> 29:00.471
could be the better path.

29:00.473 --> 29:03.507
If you think
you can do that.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.175
Sir?

29:05.177 --> 29:07.745
I found a missing persons'
report that matches our victim.

29:07.747 --> 29:10.013
Who is it?
A Hugo de Jaager.

29:10.015 --> 29:12.015
Left his family home
in Peterborough for Toronto

29:12.017 --> 29:14.384
a week ago. Hasn't been
heard from since.

29:14.386 --> 29:18.021
What's all this?
Sir, this is his research.

29:18.023 --> 29:20.324
He told his mother
before he left

29:20.326 --> 29:23.026
he was sure he was going
to find her this time.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.162
"Her"?
The girl, sir.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.164
The feral girl.

29:27.166 --> 29:31.335
Finding her became
his life's work.

29:31.337 --> 29:34.638
George, these were written

29:34.640 --> 29:36.540
years ago. Mr. de Jaager
would have still been in school.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.442
Indeed he was, sir.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.477
I took the liberty
of going through his material.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.781
His diaries were
very intriguing, very
well-written for a young lad.

29:43.783 --> 29:46.216
And what did you learn?
Well, sir, it seems

29:46.218 --> 29:49.186
young Hugo preferred his own
company to that of other boys.

29:49.188 --> 29:52.656
He spent long hours wandering
the woods near his family farm.

29:52.658 --> 29:54.958
I suppose you could say
he was a loner type, sir.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.960
In any case,

29:56.962 --> 29:59.029
one day while exploring
one of his usual haunts,

29:59.031 --> 30:01.665
he came upon a strange
and wondrous sight --

30:01.667 --> 30:03.867
a pair of feral creatures, sir,

30:03.869 --> 30:05.702
a girl and a boy.

30:05.704 --> 30:07.638
He describes them
in great detail, sir,

30:07.640 --> 30:09.740
their wild appearance,
their animal-like movements,

30:09.742 --> 30:11.742
often on all fours, sir.

30:11.744 --> 30:14.344
I can probably illustrate--
Perhaps another time, George.

30:14.346 --> 30:17.347
Thank you. Go on.
Right.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.550
Sir, when Hugo tried
to convince his mother,

30:19.552 --> 30:21.885
or anybody else who would
listen, about the children,

30:21.887 --> 30:25.856
they dismissed his tales
as wild imaginings.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.858
But he never stopped looking
for the children, sir.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.427
This is all
very interesting, George,

30:30.429 --> 30:32.763
but what has it to do
with our case?

30:32.765 --> 30:34.765
Hugo stopped trying
to convince people

30:34.767 --> 30:37.234
about the children. They became
part of his own private world.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.236
Until one day,

30:39.238 --> 30:41.271
the partially decomposed body

30:41.273 --> 30:43.273
of a young boy was found
in the woods by some hunters.

30:43.275 --> 30:46.009
Apparently, he'd been
attacked by wolves.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.312
Near the boy's body

30:48.314 --> 30:51.248
was the torn and bloody clothes
of a young girl.

30:51.250 --> 30:54.351
But the girl was never found,
dead or alive.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.221
He became haunted by the mystery
of what happened to
this young girl.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.056
It took hold of him

30:59.058 --> 31:01.058
as you can see.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.126
He's been searching
for her ever since.

31:03.128 --> 31:06.063
And he came to Toronto
believing that he had found her.

31:06.065 --> 31:09.299
According to his last
words to his mother, sir,
he was quite confident.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.802
I think perhaps
he did find her

31:11.804 --> 31:14.238
and paid the price for it.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.506
♪

31:24.916 --> 31:27.084
When am I getting
my property back?

31:27.086 --> 31:29.987
Settle down, Travis. We need
to ask you a few questions.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.589
We now know that you found Fen
somewhere a little closer

31:32.591 --> 31:35.158
than the Appalachian Mountains.
(utensil clanking in pot)

31:35.160 --> 31:37.160
So what if I did?

31:37.162 --> 31:40.264
So where was it?
Would be 20 miles or so

31:40.266 --> 31:42.266
outside of Peterborough.

31:42.268 --> 31:45.002
Not a very glamorous locale,
so I dressed it up a little.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.004
Give the punters
their money's worth.

31:47.006 --> 31:50.440
So the whole story's a lie?
Not all of it.

31:50.442 --> 31:53.343
I did almost shoot her
thinking she was a bear.

31:53.345 --> 31:56.680
She was very young,
no more than 8 I reckoned.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.216
Badly injured and starving.

31:59.218 --> 32:01.151
I fed her, treated her wounds.

32:01.153 --> 32:04.788
She recovered,
got back her strength...

32:04.790 --> 32:07.124
but never uttered more
than the odd sound.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.126
and never took
to being civilized.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.128
happy in her own filth.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.230
And that's when you started
thinking she could help

32:13.232 --> 32:16.466
pay her own way, and you created
the myth of "The Wild Child."

32:16.468 --> 32:18.302
That's about
the sum of it, yeah.

32:18.304 --> 32:21.438
Until Mr. de Jaager
discovered your campsite.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.774
He threatened to expose
your show as a hoax,

32:23.776 --> 32:26.610
and you realized you were
about to lose your meal ticket.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.947
What are you saying?
What the detective is saying

32:29.949 --> 32:32.382
is you had clear motive
for murder.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.518
(Travis and Brackenreid
laughing)

32:34.520 --> 32:36.520
Glad you find it funny because
you're under arrest, Travis.

32:36.522 --> 32:40.023
Seems like I'm not the
only one with a gift for
the tall tale, huh?

32:40.025 --> 32:43.160
You gents have come up
with a beaut.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.228
Might even work it
into my show.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.531
This was the murder weapon.

32:47.533 --> 32:50.534
My constable found it
at your old campsite,

32:50.536 --> 32:53.036
the one you were staying at
the night of the murder.

32:53.038 --> 32:55.038
Why did you move campsites?

32:55.040 --> 32:57.407
I move whenever I want.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.576
It's the beauty
of a home on wheels.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.678
This is your knife,
is it not?

33:01.680 --> 33:03.613
Might be...

33:03.615 --> 33:05.349
might not be.

33:05.351 --> 33:09.319
But I doubt you can prove
I ever touched that thing.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.222
So if I'm the murderer...

33:12.224 --> 33:15.092
show me the evidence
that'll hang me.

33:22.100 --> 33:26.169
I didn't have enough
to hold him in custody.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.338
The only person
who knows what happened

33:28.340 --> 33:30.774
that night is Fen.

33:30.776 --> 33:34.678
The bite mark is proof enough
that she met Mr. de Jaager.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.614
But we can't
communicate with her.

33:37.616 --> 33:40.717
(Roland babbling)
William, how did
those two children

33:40.719 --> 33:44.221
come to be living in the woods?
They were so young.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.323
George is combing
<i>The Peterborough Examiner</i>

33:46.325 --> 33:48.392
for clues.

33:48.394 --> 33:51.528
There has to be a story,
but likely not a happy one.

And one that
we may never know.

Julia...

33:57.469 --> 33:59.469
when he is old enough,

33:59.471 --> 34:01.938
we're going to have to tell
Roland about his parents.

34:03.808 --> 34:07.110
As hurtful as it may be to learn
that they were criminals...

34:09.380 --> 34:12.449
...you should know. Should know,

34:12.451 --> 34:16.086
hmm?
(Murdoch chuckling)

34:16.088 --> 34:18.121
Are you sure?

34:18.123 --> 34:22.159
Yes, I should meet
Roland's father.

34:22.161 --> 34:24.828
His name is Harold Connor.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.930
Julia, it will be hard

34:26.932 --> 34:28.965
to turn back
once you go down this road.

♪

Good day.
Good day. How can I help you?

34:47.119 --> 34:50.420
I'm collecting for
the local children's hospital.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.356
Would you care to make
a donation, however modest?

34:53.358 --> 34:55.759
Well, cabinet makers
don't make much,

34:55.761 --> 34:59.196
but I think I could contribute
a little something.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.465

Every penny counts.

Do you have children?
No, I don't.

35:04.336 --> 35:06.369
It's a shame.

35:06.371 --> 35:09.539
There was a time when I thought
I'd pass my skills on to a son,

Absolutely.

You know, you might have more
luck in another part of town.

35:36.535 --> 35:40.670
Thank you for your time.
Have a good day.

35:40.672 --> 35:44.341
(coins clinking)
(door closing)

35:44.343 --> 35:47.410
I started when
the poor boy's body was found,

35:47.412 --> 35:49.546
and I'm working backwards
from there. I'm down to 1890.

35:49.548 --> 35:53.150
It's very illuminating, sir,
once you drop into
the minutiae of it.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.652
Here's a story about a sow

35:55.654 --> 35:58.321
that gave birth to 13 piglets.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.390
Now that's a North Kawartha
township record.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.726
Very interesting.

36:02.728 --> 36:06.563
Sir, come look at this.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.431
A farmer reports

36:08.433 --> 36:11.301
two British Home Children

36:11.303 --> 36:13.637
ran away from his employ:

36:13.639 --> 36:16.606
a boy, 8 years old,
and a young girl of 5.

36:19.977 --> 36:22.846
Seems the farmer was more
concerned with the hardship

36:22.848 --> 36:25.382
of replacing them than
the welfare of the children.

36:25.384 --> 36:28.652
These Home Children,
they were orphan workers,

36:28.654 --> 36:31.087
sent there as cheap labour.
They were often very mistreated.

36:31.089 --> 36:33.123
Whatever the reason
they may have left,

36:33.125 --> 36:35.559
these could be the two children
Mr. de Jaager saw in the woods.

36:35.561 --> 36:37.727
The girl could be Fen, sir.
The timeline matches,

36:37.729 --> 36:41.364
this is 13 years ago.
It says the boy was mute.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.867
Sir, that's probably why
the wolves caught him.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.970
The poor thing couldn't
cry out to scare them away.
Wolves are like that, sir,

36:46.972 --> 36:48.805
they'll go for the weakest
of the bunch.

36:48.807 --> 36:51.308
Perhaps she tried
to save him

36:51.310 --> 36:53.243
and almost got herself
mauled to death.

36:53.245 --> 36:56.713
If I'm needed,
I'll be at the Asylum.

37:00.551 --> 37:03.019
Check into that detail.
Julia.

37:04.722 --> 37:07.490
I believe I've discovered
the origin of Fen's gestures.

37:07.492 --> 37:09.492
You have?
She ran away with a boy

37:09.494 --> 37:11.561
who was mute.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.631
Pardon?
Right, uh, sorry.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.633
George found a report

37:16.635 --> 37:19.169
of two Home Children
who ran away in roughly the area

37:19.171 --> 37:22.639
where Hugo de Jaager says
he spotted two feral children.

37:22.641 --> 37:25.675
They would have been
about 8 and 5 at the time.

37:25.677 --> 37:28.311
Wasn't the boy 11
when he was killed by wolves?

37:28.313 --> 37:31.514
Yes, and Mr. Travis figures
that Fen was about 8
when he found her.

37:31.516 --> 37:34.651
The two of them survived
all that time alone.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.420
Perhaps they developed
this language to communicate

37:37.422 --> 37:41.091
with each other.
That's extraordinary, William.

37:41.093 --> 37:43.126
(Fen grunting)
Fen?

37:43.128 --> 37:45.061
Fen.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.797
Fen...

37:47.799 --> 37:51.167
This man. Man...

37:51.169 --> 37:53.169
Um...

37:53.171 --> 37:55.905
who... hurt...
this man?

37:57.975 --> 38:00.810
Perhaps using her own
experience of pain may help

38:00.812 --> 38:03.079
to convey the question
you're trying to ask.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.217
Fen.

38:09.820 --> 38:12.555
Hurt.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.994
(slowly): Hurt.

38:20.231 --> 38:21.431
Hurt.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.036
Pff! Pfff!

38:28.739 --> 38:32.142
Hurt? Hurt.

38:32.144 --> 38:33.877
(Fen moaning loudly)

38:37.214 --> 38:39.549
Yes, hurt.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.651
Fen...

38:41.653 --> 38:43.653
this man.

38:43.655 --> 38:47.424
Who hurt... this man?

38:48.759 --> 38:51.361
Pa! Pa!

38:51.363 --> 38:53.663
That's the same gesture
and sound she made

38:53.665 --> 38:56.700
when she saw you with Roland!
Is she saying father?

38:56.702 --> 39:01.438
She could be.
Paaaaa! Ah!

39:01.440 --> 39:03.940
I think she's trying to
tell us who hurt Mr. de Jaager.

39:03.942 --> 39:05.742
(Fen): Pa!
You were feeding Roland

39:05.744 --> 39:07.711
when she became so animated.

39:07.713 --> 39:09.746
Perhaps she's referring
to the man who feeds her?

39:09.748 --> 39:11.448
Her keeper, Mick Travis.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.717
Is she trying to tell us
he is the killer?

39:13.719 --> 39:15.952
(Fen grunts once.)

39:15.954 --> 39:18.621
(Fen grunting)

39:18.623 --> 39:22.025
There's only one way
to find out.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.561
What the hell am I doing here?
Look at it as a field trip!

39:24.563 --> 39:27.931
(Travis): Look, I've
cooperated with you clowns. If
you think I know anything else,

39:27.933 --> 39:29.232
you're wasting your time!
Pa?

39:29.234 --> 39:32.035
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
I've just had enough of you,

39:32.037 --> 39:34.571
you lowlife piece of-Ah!
(Fen grunting)

39:34.573 --> 39:36.539
(screaming and grunting)

39:36.541 --> 39:39.042
Get off! Get off!

39:39.044 --> 39:40.977
(Travis): My property
and lay off!

39:40.979 --> 39:43.913
(man): You can't do that,
she's a human!

39:43.915 --> 39:47.150
(Fen grunting)
Don't lay your hands on her!

39:47.152 --> 39:48.485
(stabbing sound)

39:48.487 --> 39:50.854
(man screaming)

39:56.761 --> 40:00.330
Come on!
Get off! Get off!

40:00.332 --> 40:02.265
Shh! Shh!

40:02.267 --> 40:04.300
Shhh! It's alright. Shh-shh!
Are you alright, sir?

40:04.302 --> 40:06.302
I think so.

40:06.304 --> 40:09.339
It's alright. Shh!
See, Fen? No harm done.

40:09.341 --> 40:11.341
Huh? I wasn't hurt.

40:11.343 --> 40:14.878
Fen was helping, I know.
Pa. Pa.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.680
It's alright, girl.
It's alright now.

40:17.682 --> 40:20.016
Fen stabbed
Hugo de Jaager.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.485
She was trying
to protect Mr. Travis.

40:22.487 --> 40:25.889
You caught your murderer.
Makes you happy, does it?

40:33.531 --> 40:35.765
You're going to advocate
for Fen to remain at the asylum.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.767
Yes...

40:37.769 --> 40:40.403
though I can hardly argue that
she wasn't in her right mind

40:40.405 --> 40:42.772
when she stabbed
Mr. de Jaager.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.774
She was attacking
a man she thought

40:44.776 --> 40:47.677
was harming her father,
a perfectly rational action.

40:47.679 --> 40:51.347
But she didn't have men's rea,
a guilty mind,

40:51.349 --> 40:54.851
so I have
considerable leeway.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.853
Can she be helped?

40:56.855 --> 40:58.822
I don't know.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.924
But with further
attention and care,

41:00.926 --> 41:04.594
she may be able to learn
to control her wildness.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.729
And become civilized.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.698
(Julia sighs.)

41:08.700 --> 41:11.835
Given the behaviour of some of
the so-called civilized people

41:11.837 --> 41:14.838
we encounter in our work,
I wonder what we'd be
teaching her.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.840
Well, she did show us

41:16.842 --> 41:19.309
that she's capable
of empathy, Julia,

41:19.311 --> 41:22.879
by attempting to protect
Mr. Travis the way she did.

41:24.548 --> 41:27.884
It is the hallmark
of humanity.

41:27.886 --> 41:30.720
No matter what we may think
of him as a man,

41:30.722 --> 41:32.956
she saw him as her father.

41:37.728 --> 41:40.597
William, there's something
I have to tell you.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.734
(Julia sighs.)

41:51.575 --> 41:55.311
You have to look your best,
little man.

41:55.313 --> 41:57.947
You're about to meet
someone very special.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.983
♪

41:59.985 --> 42:02.619
(sigh)

42:07.424 --> 42:09.359
Mr. Connor.

42:09.361 --> 42:12.896
Detective Murdoch.

42:12.898 --> 42:16.032
He...

42:16.034 --> 42:18.034
he is a miracle.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.970
Meet your son... Roland.

42:20.972 --> 42:22.705
(Roland laughing)

42:22.707 --> 42:26.042
He's a...
he's a lovely little man,

42:26.044 --> 42:28.611
and it's been our honour

42:28.613 --> 42:30.914
to care for him.

42:30.916 --> 42:33.316
You are the very best
of people.

42:35.286 --> 42:38.454
I have some things for him
that you might find useful.

42:41.325 --> 42:43.493
I'll arrange
to have them sent over.

42:43.495 --> 42:46.195
I cannot thank you
enough times.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.234
I wish you a long

42:51.236 --> 42:53.336
and happy life together.

42:59.476 --> 43:01.344
(Roland babbling)

43:01.346 --> 43:04.180
(touching music)

43:16.694 --> 43:19.162
(Julia sobbing briefly)

43:23.200 --> 43:25.468
(Julia gasping)

43:28.639 --> 43:30.773
(Julia crying)

43:33.510 --> 43:36.512
