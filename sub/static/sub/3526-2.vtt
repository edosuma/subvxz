02:10.430 --> 02:12.557
Gentlemen,
can l get you anything?

02:17.237 --> 02:19.569
Orange County
firefighters

02:19.606 --> 02:21.471
have called in extra help

02:21.508 --> 02:24.136
from the California Department of
Forestry aircraft...

02:38.191 --> 02:42.127
Hi, you've reached the Sopranos.
Leave a message. Bye!

02:42.162 --> 02:45.290
Stop picking your nose!

02:45.331 --> 02:47.561
l'm here.
Call me.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.194
Love you.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.411
Thanks.

03:45.558 --> 03:49.858
Good morning.
Anthony Soprano.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.364
Yup.
See some photo lD, please?

04:06.779 --> 04:09.145
What the hell?

04:10.149 --> 04:11.912
This isn't my wallet.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.982
Oh no.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.156
And this isn't
my briefcase.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.461
Last night...

04:28.501 --> 04:30.435
l was at a bar across
the street from my hotel.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.836
l must have picked up
the wrong stuff.

04:32.872 --> 04:35.272
Well, l'll tell you what:
l'm here,

04:35.308 --> 04:36.866
so l'll try
to call the bar.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.809
But could you
let me in

04:38.845 --> 04:40.369
so l don't miss
the morning session?

04:40.413 --> 04:42.074
Gosh, l really can't.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.345
Look, l just flew in
from New Jersey

04:44.384 --> 04:46.944
and Colonel Colonna,
he speaks at 10:30.

04:46.986 --> 04:49.614
l can't let you in
without photo lD, sir.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.681
- Security.
- l'm on the list.

04:51.724 --> 04:53.817
Sorry.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.452
lt's a whole new world.

05:00.733 --> 05:03.031
Got a big $87 in cash
to my name.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.469
So his briefcase
is a Bally too?

05:05.505 --> 05:08.770
No. l didn't look at the brand
name when l picked it up.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.072
lt just looked like mine,
that's all.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.670
l gave you that briefcase
for Christmas, Ton'.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.443
l know, honey.
l know.

05:16.482 --> 05:20.782
His license has a Kingman, Arizona,
address and no phone is listed.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.380
What's in the briefcase?
Did you look?

05:23.423 --> 05:26.449
Yeah, of course l looked.
There's a bunch of brochures

05:26.492 --> 05:29.359
for solar heating systems.
No company name.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.829
He'll get in touch.

05:31.864 --> 05:35.095
That was
a great lecture.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.796
- Oh, look at this now, look.
- What?

05:37.837 --> 05:41.273
- Nothing.
- Try not to worry, Ton'.

05:41.307 --> 05:43.104
My whole life's
in that case.

05:49.382 --> 05:51.111
Thank you.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.610
- Welcome to the Radisson.
- How you doing?

05:54.654 --> 05:58.283
l checked out a couple hours ago but l'm
going to need the room back. Soprano.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.694
l am sorry, but we're
completely booked.

06:02.729 --> 06:04.356
- You're kidding.
- l'm afraid not.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.161
There's six conventions in town.
You might try the Omni.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.963
Trouble is
l lost my wallet,

06:09.001 --> 06:11.299
so how the hell am l going to check
in there without a credit card?

06:11.337 --> 06:12.895
You'd face the same
problem here.

06:12.939 --> 06:15.100
Yeah, but l stayed here
as a guest just last night.

06:15.141 --> 06:17.871
You couldn't sign on that bill,
you've already closed it out.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.935
Thanks for being
so helpful.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.318
Hi.

06:37.363 --> 06:38.762
What can l get you?

06:38.798 --> 06:43.098
Well, l don't know
if you remember me,

06:43.136 --> 06:45.832
but l was in here
last night around 8:00.

06:45.872 --> 06:48.033
l was sitting
right over there.

06:48.074 --> 06:51.202
l ordered the blackened grouper
sandwich then l canceled.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.407
- Said l had pains in my stomach.
- Vaguely, okay...

06:54.447 --> 06:57.644
Well, when l was leaving,
l picked up a wallet and a briefcase

06:57.683 --> 07:00.117
and l thought they were mine,

07:00.153 --> 07:01.711
- but they weren't.
- Oh, Jesus.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.154
You don't happen to remember
who was sitting next to me?

07:04.190 --> 07:06.055
You know,
there was a guy.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.992
He was
about your height.

07:08.027 --> 07:10.689
You know the reason l remember
is he'd had that grouper sand too

07:10.730 --> 07:14.131
and l was afraid we'd mess the orders
up. l think he left before you.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.226
- And he never came back?
- No.

07:18.337 --> 07:20.567
You know the name
Kevin Finnerty?

07:20.606 --> 07:22.665
- He drives a Lexus.
- You know him?

07:22.708 --> 07:25.336
lt's a joke.
lnfinity? Lexus?

07:26.712 --> 07:28.577
l imagine you could use
one on the house.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.674
Yeah, yeah.
You said a mouthful.

07:32.852 --> 07:34.911
- Uh, Scotch rocks.
- All right.

07:36.522 --> 07:39.184
- Glenlivet okay?
- Oh yeah, better than okay.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.924
Well, might as well
hang out here

07:42.962 --> 07:45.692
in case he shows or calls.

07:45.731 --> 07:48.598
You realize l can't even get on a plane
without a picture lD?

07:48.634 --> 07:51.626
Oh God, that's right.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.965
Well, tell me
about Costa Mesa.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.566
Nice place to live?

07:57.610 --> 08:00.773
Around here?
lt's dead.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.456
Give me
the grouper sandwich.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.985
You got it.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.260
Bag the sandwich.
Come eat with us.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.269
A few of us are getting a table.
Dude lost his wallet and briefcase.

08:24.303 --> 08:27.602
- Man. Oh no.
- That's all right. Thanks anyway.

08:27.640 --> 08:31.269
Come on. That tool who took your stuff
shows up, we'll all pound his ass.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.738
Okay, thanks.

08:40.785 --> 08:44.119
U.S. Drill Bit.
Aerospace and industrial equipment.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.317
We just sold our gear
and coupling unit to Wheela-brator

08:46.359 --> 08:49.123
- to focus on pumps and compressors.
- lnteresting.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.891
Tony, you never did tell us
how you made the jump

08:51.931 --> 08:54.627
from selling patio furniture
to precision optics.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.396
Well, like my wife says,
that's a good question.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.963
Excuse me for one minute.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.236
Hi Daddy.
l made volleyball.

09:02.275 --> 09:05.972
All right! l told you, didn't l?
You were worried over nothing.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.479
How's your brother?

09:07.513 --> 09:10.311
Mom put him to bed early.
He puked.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.943
Oh no.
ls she around?

09:12.985 --> 09:15.476
Mom!
Bye, Dad.

09:15.521 --> 09:16.818
Bye, baby.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.517
Ton', how ya doing?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.458
Finnerty didn't
call there, did he?

09:20.493 --> 09:23.121
No. l'd have let you know
right away.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.302
Where'd Jeff
and Kansas go?

09:31.337 --> 09:33.931
To bed, and they
sucker-punched you, buddy.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.440
They paid the check.

09:35.474 --> 09:37.271
You guys all had a hand
in this, didn't you?

09:37.310 --> 09:39.904
Listen, we're just impressed
to be in the presence of a man

09:39.946 --> 09:42.244
whose sales team snatched
the brass ring

09:42.281 --> 09:43.942
1 2 consecutive quarters.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.952
lt's not such a big deal.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.977
There's always
a faster gun.

09:50.656 --> 09:53.955
l'm 46 years old.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.188
l mean, who am l?

09:56.228 --> 09:57.923
Where am l going?

09:57.964 --> 10:00.398
Join the club.

10:18.918 --> 10:21.819
Now is the time you can
clearly hear His voice.

10:21.854 --> 10:24.982
Let us rejoice
in His love.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.720
Mmmm.

10:36.736 --> 10:39.068
This isn't
going to happen.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.732
What are you talking about?

10:40.773 --> 10:43.799
l saw your face when you got off
the phone with your wife.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.071
So?

10:46.112 --> 10:49.172
Don't sweat it.
lt's sweet, actually.

10:49.215 --> 10:52.378
But you talk about them
back there a lot.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.080
l could even be
some other guy tonight

10:55.121 --> 10:57.316
and get away with
the whole shebang.

10:57.356 --> 11:00.450
But no,
l blow it.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.590
They're looking
for a perp.

11:17.810 --> 11:20.301
His eyes are open.
Two, three.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.836
He's bucking the vent.
Give me the lights.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.974
- l'll get some restraints.
- Four milligrams Ativan.

11:24.016 --> 11:27.042
He was just lying there peacefully
just like he has been and then he just--

11:27.086 --> 11:30.453
- He's still bucking.
- Room three! The gunshot.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.516
He pulled his tubes out!

11:33.559 --> 11:35.254
l have to retube him.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.762
- Oh God.
- Etomidate and sux and an airway box.

11:37.797 --> 11:40.095
- Take the family out.
- Give us room to move.

11:40.132 --> 11:42.362
- Please wait outside.
- Where's the Ativan, please?

11:42.401 --> 11:43.993
l got him.

11:45.971 --> 11:48.132
- Tony.
- Dad?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.075
- Mr. Soprano.
- Tony?

11:52.111 --> 11:54.807
- What, honey?
- Who am l? Where am l going?

11:54.847 --> 11:57.441
We're right here with you.
Tony, who am l?

11:57.483 --> 12:00.111
Get ready to retube him.
Sir, can you hear me?

12:00.152 --> 12:02.450
Who am l?
Where am l going?

12:02.488 --> 12:04.718
- Dad!
- Tony!

12:04.757 --> 12:07.123
l'm going to have to insist
that you guys leave.

12:07.159 --> 12:10.560
Getting this breathing tube back in is
something you're not gonna want to see.

12:12.198 --> 12:15.099
- What's going on?
- You're just getting back?

12:15.134 --> 12:17.125
Matt's car wouldn't start.

12:17.169 --> 12:19.603
- Did you eat at least?
- Yeah.

12:19.638 --> 12:22.766
Dad's not so good right now.
They made us leave.

12:38.724 --> 12:41.716
l got to go.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.525
- What's the latest?
- He came out of the coma for a minute.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.588
They took
the breathing tube out.

12:46.632 --> 12:48.725
That's good, right?
That means he's breathing on his own.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.362
They had to put
the tube back in.

12:51.403 --> 12:55.032
- Goddamn Junior.
- Anthony Soprano is not going to die.

12:55.074 --> 12:57.440
l don't know what
everybody's talking about.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.307
Nobody's saying
he's going to die.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.677
Could one of you take
these guys home, please? 2:00 a.m.

13:01.714 --> 13:05.411
You can't live in this lCU.
Two nights straight is too much.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.442
l'm okay.
Mead spelled me last night.

13:07.486 --> 13:10.785
- l'm staying tonight too.
- l want you to go back.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.815
Okay, people call the house.
l need somebody there.

13:13.859 --> 13:15.952
Ma, you want some tea?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.322
Van Helsing, let's go.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.767
- l'll take him.
- l got it.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.795
- He's on my way.
- Bullshit, you live in Bellevue.

13:26.839 --> 13:29.501
- What do you care?
- You already brought the sfogliatelle!

13:29.542 --> 13:31.339
Let's go.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.818
Got him back on the ventilator,
mucus plug.

13:41.854 --> 13:45.153
The bullet didn't just tear up the
pancreas, it impacted the gall bladder.

13:45.191 --> 13:48.558
Sepsis is the big problem.
An infection in the blood.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.721
l've got him sedated
and restrained

13:50.763 --> 13:52.492
so he can't pull his
breathing tubes out.

13:52.531 --> 13:54.965
- Okay, then what?
- As we discussed before,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.093
we're probably not looking
at a very good outcome here.

13:57.136 --> 13:59.331
Should we call Dr. Plepler?

13:59.371 --> 14:01.999
l'll let him know.
And Taschlin too. He'll stop by.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.804
Does he know
that he's dying?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.073
We don't know.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.732
Welcome to the Omni.
How may l help you?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.796
Name is Finnerty.
l called and reserved a room.

15:44.643 --> 15:48.079
Yes, Mr. Finnerty, we have you down
for a single room for the night.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.546
Did you wish to keep
that on the Visa?

15:49.581 --> 15:51.481
Uh, yeah.

15:51.517 --> 15:54.111
l'll need to take
an imprint to cover incidentals.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.383
Sure.

16:16.675 --> 16:19.701
Room 728.
Elevators are on your left.

16:23.082 --> 16:26.017
Have a good night.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.916
Thank you.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.948
- Good night.
- Night.

16:42.434 --> 16:45.301
Kevin Finnerty?

16:45.337 --> 16:48.306
We thought we heard
that man say your name.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.400
How fortuitous we should
meet up with you again.

16:51.443 --> 16:55.072
You know him?
This is important.

16:55.114 --> 16:58.447
Months you have ignored
our letters and phone calls.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.850
Well, we are now
filing suit against you.

17:00.886 --> 17:03.013
No, okay, back up.

17:03.055 --> 17:04.886
l'm not Kevin Finnerty.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.718
l have his wallet
by mistake

17:07.760 --> 17:10.661
and l guess l look
a little like him?

17:10.695 --> 17:12.596
So he is from around here?

17:12.631 --> 17:16.157
We had a horrible winter
at the monastery

17:16.201 --> 17:18.567
because of your
heating system.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.401
l'm not Kevin Finnerty.

17:20.439 --> 17:22.498
- Lose your arrogance.
- Son of a bitch!

17:22.540 --> 17:24.566
Hey!
Hey, come on guys.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.601
Did you see?
He hit me!

17:29.915 --> 17:31.280
Don't let him--
he hit me!

17:31.316 --> 17:34.513
- You okay?
- Don't let him go!

17:34.553 --> 17:36.248
l was just trying
to block your fall.

17:36.288 --> 17:37.949
Did you see that?

17:37.990 --> 17:40.083
Why would l be joking?

17:40.125 --> 17:42.150
He slapped me in the mouth.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.821
Did you file
a police report?

17:43.862 --> 17:47.161
l'm staying here
under somebody else's credit card.

17:47.199 --> 17:50.293
- You could've explained that.
- Oh, you're so sure?

17:50.335 --> 17:52.735
lt's fraud.

17:52.771 --> 17:55.672
Does the hotel know if there's
a Buddhist temple or anything around?

17:55.707 --> 17:57.470
They say there's
more than one.

17:57.509 --> 17:59.943
lf l could find the place
and l could get some words in edgewise,

17:59.978 --> 18:01.707
they might point me
to Finnerty.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.012
But who wants more complications?
l just want to come home.

18:05.050 --> 18:09.077
l know. You never even wanted
to go to this conference.

18:09.121 --> 18:12.682
l agree. You should just leave tomorrow
and not go on to Houston.

18:12.724 --> 18:14.214
l'll wire you cash.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.817
Can l claim the cash
without lD?

18:15.861 --> 18:18.887
Shit.
That's a good question.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.423
All right, l'll call Doenitz, see if the
company can help.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.402
l miss you.

18:24.436 --> 18:28.668
l miss you too, but you're
off in your own world.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.868
You're too distracted
with work.

18:30.909 --> 18:34.242
This is partly your fault.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.543
Call me later
if you can't sleep.

18:36.582 --> 18:39.050
Love you.

18:39.084 --> 18:40.745
Love you.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.220
Good morning.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.724
Oh!

19:46.151 --> 19:49.177
- Mead honey?
- How is he?

19:50.722 --> 19:53.452
The same.

19:53.492 --> 19:57.326
But another night has passed
and he is still with us.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.632
He's not the same.

20:02.668 --> 20:06.502
His fever dropped to 39.1. That's
102-point-something.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.274
Oh, Dr. Plepler.
Good morning.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.039
Hear we had a rumpus
last night, huh?

20:13.078 --> 20:15.239
Oh, God.
lt was awful.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.145
How long since
he left my O.R.?

20:17.182 --> 20:19.582
- His amylase is 41.
- Hematocrit still okay?

20:19.618 --> 20:21.552
- Yup.
- Good.

20:23.989 --> 20:26.355
Hi. How's my big brother
doing today?

20:35.200 --> 20:37.327
Everything's okay here.

20:37.369 --> 20:39.269
You mean
just the surgery per se?

20:39.304 --> 20:41.932
- Uh-hmm.
- Well what about the sepsis?

20:41.974 --> 20:44.442
Yeah, well that's the concern.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.603
What did Taschlin say
this morning?

20:46.645 --> 20:49.011
Dr. Taschlin never came
in here this morning.

20:49.047 --> 20:51.345
Well, no matter.
l'll be talking to him.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.351
Go ahead and change
the dressing, huh.

20:53.385 --> 20:54.943
Does this mean the chances
could be worse

20:54.987 --> 20:56.545
my husband could not
come out of his coma?

20:56.588 --> 20:58.488
Actually, now
we've induced coma.

20:58.523 --> 21:00.718
- He's snowed with Ativan.
- What? Why?

21:00.759 --> 21:04.820
Control the seizures while we try to
knock down the fever with antibiotics.

21:04.863 --> 21:07.889
lt says his temperature's
down some.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.663
The problem here is not only

21:10.702 --> 21:13.637
are we looking at the obvious
negative outcome,

21:13.672 --> 21:15.867
but in these cases

21:15.907 --> 21:20.037
we also contemplate
degrees of brain damage

21:20.078 --> 21:22.012
in the event
he does survive.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.119
- What antibiotic is he on?
- Zosyn.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.724
Sorry, Doctor, she volunteered in
an lCU this summer.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.627
Columbia Pres in New York. She's
thinking about a career in medicine.

21:37.663 --> 21:40.757
- Oh, good.
- Or law, l don't know.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.666
Good morning, Doctor.
l'm the sister. We met yesterday.

21:43.702 --> 21:45.499
Look, you're all doing
the right thing.

21:45.537 --> 21:48.904
You're staying with him,
keeping contact, but talk to him also.

21:48.940 --> 21:52.341
Keep him engaged. You might want
to play some of his favorite music.

21:52.377 --> 21:54.208
You know
fortunately for him,

21:54.246 --> 21:57.841
he is at a level-one
trauma center.

21:57.883 --> 22:00.317
Or with his injuries, believe me,
he would have been dead 1 2 hours ago.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.650
Okay, l see.
Thank you, Doctor.

22:02.688 --> 22:05.054
''Thank you, Doctor''?

22:05.090 --> 22:07.718
''l'm sorry, she volunteered
at an lCU''?

22:07.759 --> 22:09.750
You treat these guys
like rock stars.

22:09.795 --> 22:12.764
- He's the doctor, Meadow.
- Well why bring up brain damage now?

22:12.798 --> 22:14.527
We'll cross that bridge
if we have to.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.796
l came by to help, guys.
Anything.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.860
l left Nica
with Bobby's mother.

22:18.904 --> 22:20.428
You both should get
some rest.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.872
Come on in and see him.
Your sister's here too.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.646
Oh my God.
Oh God.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.414
l can't get used to this.
Oh my God.

22:37.689 --> 22:41.523
- Oh my God. l can't...
- l know, Janice. l know.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.461
Get her some water.
Come here, sit down.

22:46.465 --> 22:49.195
- lt's okay, it's okay.
- That's my brother!

22:53.638 --> 22:56.072
- What are these?
- A watch and a pencil.

22:56.108 --> 22:59.100
Repeat the following
sentence,

22:59.144 --> 23:01.078
''No ifs, ands or buts.''

23:01.113 --> 23:02.546
l'll do it if l fucking
feel like it.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.549
Take your ultimatums
and stick them in your ass.

23:04.583 --> 23:06.278
No, repeat the sentence.

23:06.318 --> 23:09.116
What is this person
talking about?!

23:09.154 --> 23:11.714
These people are trying to establish
for the government,

23:11.757 --> 23:15.284
that if you shot Anthony
Soprano, which we're not conceding,

23:15.327 --> 23:17.158
that it certainly wasn't
intentional--

23:17.195 --> 23:19.129
that you were confused
and disoriented.

23:19.164 --> 23:21.462
- Don't coach him, please.
- My nephew Anthony?

23:21.500 --> 23:24.469
- That's why you're here in custody.
- Where's Mel?

23:24.503 --> 23:27.370
You dismissed Mr. Melvoin
as your attorney and hired me.

23:27.406 --> 23:31.103
Because of his paralyzed hand from
his stroke, it made your nervous.

23:31.143 --> 23:34.271
lf somebody shot my nephew
it was him himself.

23:34.312 --> 23:36.007
He's a depression case.

23:59.137 --> 24:02.470
You got any beefs,
l'm the one you come to.

24:02.507 --> 24:05.271
Likewise, weekly l'll
collect for the skip.

24:05.310 --> 24:09.371
l'll keep it for him
until he's back on his feet,

24:09.414 --> 24:11.245
taking out a portion
for Carmela

24:11.283 --> 24:13.649
to run the house
and that shit there.

24:13.685 --> 24:14.982
- Good.
- Absolutely.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.716
Anybody got
any questions?

24:17.756 --> 24:20.657
For now, not personal questions
relating to yourself,

24:20.692 --> 24:22.216
but about the family.

24:24.129 --> 24:27.064
- Yeah, Vito.
- The sports book in Roseville.

24:27.098 --> 24:29.498
By rights, that should
go to me now.

24:29.534 --> 24:32.128
- Eugene was with me.
- Yo, what'd l just say?

24:32.170 --> 24:33.967
Not about yourself!

24:34.005 --> 24:35.939
What do we do about Junior?

24:35.974 --> 24:38.067
He's in jail.
That puts him out of our reach.

24:38.109 --> 24:40.475
- Not necessarily.
- He's a demented old fuck.

24:40.512 --> 24:43.310
l say we do nothing.
Let him rot, sever all ties.

24:43.348 --> 24:45.009
End this embarrassment
right now.

24:45.050 --> 24:48.713
He ''Marvin Gayed''
his own nephew, the boss of this family.

24:48.753 --> 24:50.846
What happens to Junior
is Tony's call.

24:50.889 --> 24:52.880
- That's right.
- Bobby,

24:52.924 --> 24:56.451
all due respect, where the fuck
were you that night?

24:56.495 --> 24:59.396
Why was the skipper
babysitting Junior?

24:59.431 --> 25:02.161
l had other
family obligations.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.397
Ask my wife.
Tony volunteered.

25:07.839 --> 25:11.138
Are we done?
l'm going back to the hospital.

25:22.721 --> 25:25.713
He's gotta make an issue
out of everything lately.

25:25.757 --> 25:28.590
Roseville's been Junior's
territory since the Big Bang,

25:28.627 --> 25:31.619
which means it goes to Bobby
now that Junior's out of the picture.

25:31.663 --> 25:33.722
Vito already pulls down
more scratch

25:33.765 --> 25:35.596
than anybody,
from the unions.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.192
Let him go
to the hospital first,

25:37.235 --> 25:39.965
that fat fucking kiss-ass.

25:40.005 --> 25:43.031
l'm buying Tony a nice little
stereo for the room.

25:43.074 --> 25:45.668
He don't need that.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.735
Look at this fucking mutt.

25:47.779 --> 25:50.407
Who wouldn't like to take
the easy way out?

25:52.517 --> 25:54.508
Maybe the poor fuck
was suffering

25:54.553 --> 25:56.578
from inoperable
cancer or some shit.

25:57.822 --> 25:59.687
Suicide runs in families.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.851
Maybe it was his mother
or his old man

26:01.893 --> 26:04.862
took the gas pipe
when Eugene was a kid.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.989
His son,
the drugs maybe.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.400
l knew him better
than anybody, but still...

26:13.171 --> 26:16.072
Maybe he was a homo, felt there was
nobody he could talk to about it.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.404
That happens too.

26:22.280 --> 26:25.681
Good thing Tony never heard
about him killing himself, at least.

26:25.717 --> 26:28.686
Got enough on his plate.

26:28.820 --> 26:31.118
The nurse told me
she saw AJ.

26:31.156 --> 26:32.680
She did?

26:32.724 --> 26:35.784
l asked him to bring
Dad's Tony Bennett box set from home.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.565
Yeah, it's been
kind of weird.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.367
Would you call it
growing up Soprano?

26:47.405 --> 26:49.873
l guess.
l don't know.

26:49.908 --> 26:52.502
Come with me.

26:57.248 --> 26:59.409
Hold on there.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.450
What did l tell you?

27:02.487 --> 27:04.148
We were just talking.

27:04.189 --> 27:07.681
Don't talk to them.
Say nothing.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.523
Where are your father's CDs?

27:09.561 --> 27:11.620
- l forgot.
- Oh Jesus God, Anthony.

27:11.663 --> 27:14.655
- Everybody is pitching in here but you.
- Thanks, Mom.

27:14.699 --> 27:17.031
l wish you would go to class if this
is all you're gonna do.

27:17.068 --> 27:19.866
With my father
in the hospital?

27:19.904 --> 27:22.395
Go to the deli on Broad Street.
Get some bagels.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.000
All right? Get enough
for everybody upstairs, an assortment.

27:25.043 --> 27:27.739
And go this way.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.080
Look. Chris just sent
this over.

27:37.122 --> 27:39.886
A little stereo.

27:47.265 --> 27:49.756
Mead, my God,
l'm telling you,

27:49.801 --> 27:54.534
she seems like she's grown up so much.
What she knows.

27:54.572 --> 27:57.040
She will make
a terrific doctor.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.839
l got some CDs
from my car.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.478
Oh yes,
you like this one.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.142
Anthony, Anthony.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.649
Ho, Sheriff
of Nottingham.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.016
My kingdom
for a mortadella, huh?

29:15.053 --> 29:17.954
They make a great sandwich here.
No getting around it.

29:17.989 --> 29:20.287
What about that disease
you picked up over there

29:20.325 --> 29:22.725
in Diarrhea-stan
or wherever the fuck you were?

29:22.761 --> 29:25.594
This might be the cure.

29:25.630 --> 29:28.064
Yeah, we're sorry
to hear about Tony.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.829
l got nothing to say
about what happened so--

29:30.869 --> 29:33.565
That's not why l asked.
How's he doing?

29:33.605 --> 29:36.472
He's fucked up.
You know what l think?

29:36.508 --> 29:38.908
l think you don't come
here for the sandwiches.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.706
l think you come
'cause you miss us.

29:42.814 --> 29:47.148
Hey, l can't blame you.
That job you got now must be depressing.

29:47.185 --> 29:50.086
- How goes the war on terror anyway?
- Working it.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.851
l heard Fieldcrest reported
a truckload of towels missing.

29:52.891 --> 29:55.018
We actually spend a little more of our
time trying to interdict

29:55.059 --> 29:57.653
the financial networks
that fund the terror cells worldwide.

29:57.695 --> 30:00.255
- No shit.
- Truck hijacking, narcotics.

30:00.298 --> 30:03.734
ln fact, if you ever heard
of anything going down,

30:03.768 --> 30:05.565
Middle Easterners,
Pakistanis,

30:05.603 --> 30:07.730
you'd be helping a lot
if you picked up a phone.

30:07.772 --> 30:10.536
- And called you?
- lt's your country too, isn't it?

30:10.575 --> 30:14.238
Like l'd know one of these suicide
jerk-offs if he bit me on the the ass.

30:14.279 --> 30:17.510
You knew Matoush Zhia.
Hung out at your girlfriend's club.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.450
He was a drug dealer,
her friend.

30:20.485 --> 30:23.750
l didn't know shit about his politics
till one of your people told me.

30:23.788 --> 30:25.415
Something to keep in mind.

30:25.456 --> 30:27.686
l take that terrorism
shit seriously.

30:27.725 --> 30:30.285
And Tony, don't even
get him started.

31:00.291 --> 31:02.623
This song was playing
in your car

31:02.660 --> 31:05.254
that entire weekend

31:05.296 --> 31:07.230
we all went down
to Long Beach lsland.

31:09.601 --> 31:12.161
Remember Artie and Charmaine
broke up for the first time?

31:12.203 --> 31:13.830
First of many.

31:17.775 --> 31:21.506
She accused him of letting
her drown in the ocean. Remember that?

31:21.546 --> 31:23.411
That wave picked her up

31:23.448 --> 31:25.973
and slammed her down
on her head in the sand?

31:29.254 --> 31:31.779
Oh my God,
her around water.

31:34.525 --> 31:38.052
And remember the time that she got
cramps from eating that huge calzone?

31:38.096 --> 31:39.893
You had to go in after her.

31:39.931 --> 31:42.798
She almost dragged
you down by your hair.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.997
Oh...

31:46.037 --> 31:49.268
lmagine that.

31:49.307 --> 31:51.741
At one time
you had enough hair

31:51.776 --> 31:54.438
that a woman could grab it
with both her hands.

32:04.856 --> 32:07.450
You're going to be fine, Tony.
l know it.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.790
The doctors say
you're going to be fine too.

32:15.099 --> 32:18.125
They are very confident.

32:18.169 --> 32:20.262
They know that you are really strong.

32:20.305 --> 32:23.035
You're strong as a bull.

32:29.514 --> 32:31.880
You know that
that's always gotten to me.

32:31.916 --> 32:34.714
When you used to pick
me up and throw me over your shoulder--

32:34.752 --> 32:36.686
oh my God, Tony.

32:36.721 --> 32:39.246
You used to get me
so hot down there.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.054
l can feel it right now
just thinking about it.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.602
You are going to be
okay, Tony.

32:51.636 --> 32:55.572
Your friends,
your kids all love you.

33:21.032 --> 33:24.263
A long time ago l told you you were
going to go to hell when you died,

33:24.302 --> 33:26.566
when you had that MRl.

33:30.141 --> 33:33.008
And you threw my words back
at me when we got separated.

33:33.044 --> 33:36.639
And you were right.
That was a horrible thing to say.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.546
lt's a sin,

33:38.583 --> 33:40.881
and l will be
judged for it.

33:44.255 --> 33:46.155
You're a good father.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.658
You care about your friends.

33:55.466 --> 33:57.559
Yes, it's been
rough between us.

33:59.537 --> 34:02.131
l don't know, our hearts
get so hardened

34:02.173 --> 34:04.266
against each other.
l don't know why.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.077
But you are not
going to hell.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.487
You're coming back here.

34:28.565 --> 34:30.761
l love you.

34:49.520 --> 34:53.114
Mr. Finnerty,
sorry it took so long,

34:53.157 --> 34:55.717
but l saw some things
on the CT scan l didn't like,

34:55.760 --> 34:58.991
which is why l ordered
the MRl.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.368
How long have l been here?

35:05.403 --> 35:07.394
ln looking at your MRl,

35:07.438 --> 35:09.406
see these dark areas?

35:09.440 --> 35:12.898
These are parts of your brain that have
been oxygen deprived.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.903
- Uh-huh.
- Unfortunately, these are consistent

35:16.948 --> 35:20.645
- with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's.
- What?

35:20.685 --> 35:23.153
You're going to want to see
a neurologist when you get home,

35:23.187 --> 35:26.850
but the radiologist here
has seen the studies and he concurs.

35:26.891 --> 35:30.019
Alzheimer's?
l'm 46 years old.

35:30.061 --> 35:33.588
- l know.
- What the hell?

35:37.001 --> 35:39.367
This goddamn miserable trip.

35:39.403 --> 35:41.303
The good news is
the treatment picture

35:41.339 --> 35:44.069
isn't quite as bleak
as it would have been a while back.

35:44.108 --> 35:47.077
lt's a death sentence.

35:47.111 --> 35:50.774
You're a smurf for 10 or 15 years and
then you die

35:50.815 --> 35:52.874
shitting in your pajamas.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.680
l know people
with Alzheimer's.

35:54.719 --> 35:57.779
Mr. Finnerty, talk
to your own docs back home.

35:57.822 --> 36:00.086
My name's not even Finnerty.

36:00.124 --> 36:03.287
l lost my wallet and my briefcase,
and l picked his up.

36:03.327 --> 36:07.161
So you guys took out
his insurance card from his wallet.

36:07.198 --> 36:10.326
- How's that float your boat?
- Well, what is your name?

36:10.368 --> 36:13.531
What does it matter?
l'm not going to know myself soon.

36:17.775 --> 36:19.868
You can rest here a while.

36:19.911 --> 36:23.210
You're fine other than
the minor concussion.

36:23.247 --> 36:26.341
Fall like that could have
broken your neck.

36:31.822 --> 36:34.256
l'm lost.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.192
AJ wanted to come
but he got

36:36.227 --> 36:38.661
a really bad stomach flu
from a burrito.

36:41.699 --> 36:44.930
Law firm's being so understanding
about me taking time off

36:44.969 --> 36:47.460
from my internship
to be here.

36:52.677 --> 36:55.578
Finn's coming out.

36:55.613 --> 36:58.013
He really likes you.

37:07.458 --> 37:10.757
l was reading this morning
and l found this.

37:10.795 --> 37:13.491
l want to share it with you.

37:13.531 --> 37:16.967
By Jacques Prevert--

37:17.001 --> 37:18.969
''Our Father which art

37:19.003 --> 37:22.530
in Heaven, stay there,

37:22.573 --> 37:24.541
and we shall stay on Earth,

37:24.575 --> 37:27.135
which is sometimes so pretty.''

37:56.407 --> 37:58.534
Look, l took
some Pepto-Bismol.

38:21.699 --> 38:23.690
How much do you know
about the Prius?

38:26.971 --> 38:28.962
l could've been
naked in here.

38:29.006 --> 38:31.907
You need to familiarize
yourself with hybrid cars, Meadow.

38:31.942 --> 38:34.570
lt's important.
This is the conversation of the future.

38:34.612 --> 38:37.274
Why are you breaking my balls
about hybrid cars?

38:37.315 --> 38:39.340
l don't give a shit.
l've been up all night.

38:39.383 --> 38:41.351
Oh, you're tired?
Poor you.

38:41.385 --> 38:43.353
You never give two fucks
about the environment.

38:43.387 --> 38:45.116
ls that what's crawling
up your butt?

38:45.156 --> 38:47.681
That l was at the hospital
last night when you told Mom you'd come?

38:47.725 --> 38:50.421
l didn't say one word to you
about it and neither did anyone else.

38:50.461 --> 38:52.691
We're all so glad you fucking
kicked your stomach flu, okay?

38:52.730 --> 38:54.425
l saw how you looked
at my plate of food.

38:54.465 --> 38:56.092
l can't eat
at my own house?

38:56.133 --> 38:59.102
l wasn't looking at your plate.
lt's all in your mind.

39:18.656 --> 39:21.181
Don't you find this
completely embarrassing?

39:21.225 --> 39:22.522
What?

39:22.560 --> 39:24.926
This, our family.

39:24.962 --> 39:27.863
Our father gets shot
by our goober fucking uncle?

39:27.898 --> 39:30.628
- What is that?
- Yeah, it's embarrassing.

39:30.668 --> 39:33.967
l don't want to think
about what Finn's parents are saying.

39:34.004 --> 39:37.405
l mean, l don't really give
a shit about my friends.

39:37.441 --> 39:41.377
They know what Dad does, but like,
some of them remember Uncle Junior.

39:41.412 --> 39:44.176
He was always
a fucking mummy.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.706
- Why did Dad hang out with him?
- You know Dad.

39:46.751 --> 39:49.777
He takes those things
seriously, all the ltalian family stuff.

39:49.820 --> 39:53.119
Yeah, l got the big lecture.
Now look.

39:53.157 --> 39:55.125
l know.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.692
Look at these
fucking reporters.

40:01.465 --> 40:04.798
Hey!
Fuck you!

40:04.869 --> 40:06.837
l'll be glad
to sit with Tony.

40:06.871 --> 40:09.897
Hospital rules, it's family
only for now, but thank you.

40:13.911 --> 40:16.311
Angie phoned.

40:16.347 --> 40:19.373
Guess she's very busy over there
with her body shop.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.750
- You want some grits?
- Huh-uh.

40:22.787 --> 40:24.516
Oh, look who's here.

40:24.555 --> 40:27.319
Hey Fabio, l'm available.

40:28.492 --> 40:30.790
So what? Now there's
an actual roster

40:30.828 --> 40:32.853
of who stays with Dad
and when, and l'm not on it?

40:32.897 --> 40:35.627
Frankly, AJ, l didn't think
you'd be interested.

40:35.666 --> 40:38.157
l was sick and l've
been trying to study,

40:38.202 --> 40:41.262
which is what everybody's usually
hassling me about 24/7.

40:41.305 --> 40:43.603
l guess there always
has to be something, right?

40:43.641 --> 40:46.007
Come here
and sit down, okay?

40:50.881 --> 40:53.213
''Studying.''
He goes clubbing in New York.

40:53.250 --> 40:57.243
Well you cut him too much slack.
You still protect him.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.451
l know he avoids Tony because he
can't face seeing him like this.

41:00.491 --> 41:02.789
- lt frightens him.
- lt frightens everybody.

41:02.827 --> 41:04.886
He should get a pass?
You know kids his age

41:04.929 --> 41:06.829
are getting blown up
in lraq.

41:06.864 --> 41:09.094
You know something
that's interesting? Janice noticed

41:09.133 --> 41:12.728
that when AJ talks about Tony's
possibly not coming out of this,

41:12.770 --> 41:14.203
he can't even use
the word ''dad.''

41:14.238 --> 41:16.832
He says ''Anthony Soprano
is not going to die.''

41:16.874 --> 41:20.469
Well, that's a fascinating
psychological nugget,

41:20.511 --> 41:22.206
but it don't change the fact

41:22.246 --> 41:24.544
that if that kid
don't pull his end in this,

41:24.582 --> 41:27.278
he's never going to forgive
himself and nobody else should either.

41:27.318 --> 41:31.379
lt's just that Tony has
always loomed so large for AJ.

41:31.422 --> 41:34.755
Well maybe it's just that AJ is a
selfish boy who doesn't give a shit.

41:36.861 --> 41:38.988
l'm sorry your son
is no longer with us

41:39.029 --> 41:42.226
but don't use mine as a guinea pig
for your ideas on parenting.

41:42.266 --> 41:44.234
l never saw you
take a hard line.

41:44.268 --> 41:46.930
Why do you think l'm talking
to you like this?

41:56.013 --> 41:59.881
The thing is,
Tony has an open incision.

41:59.917 --> 42:03.444
lf you are there in the room
and they change the dressing,

42:03.487 --> 42:06.217
it's very hard to take.

42:06.257 --> 42:08.487
And l don't know
that AJ should see that.

42:24.108 --> 42:25.871
Hey!

42:27.177 --> 42:28.974
Get the fuck
off the property!

42:29.013 --> 42:32.073
Hey! l warned you yesterday.
The curb line is your limit.

42:35.653 --> 42:37.814
l know.
l know you hate it.

42:39.623 --> 42:42.023
l'm not going to tell
you what to do, Finn.

42:42.059 --> 42:45.825
How would you describe your husband's
relationship with his uncle?

42:47.831 --> 42:49.958
Were they close?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.059
You know of any issue
they might have been having?

42:52.102 --> 42:54.764
l don't speak with Junior.
l haven't for years.

42:54.805 --> 42:58.070
My husband knows how l feel
and he never brought him up.

42:58.108 --> 43:00.167
What was
your conflict about?

43:00.210 --> 43:02.508
lt's not something
l'm going to discuss with you.

43:02.546 --> 43:04.878
Your husband ever talk about
Junior Soprano's mental state?

43:04.915 --> 43:08.078
You're flying
full-fare coach?

43:08.118 --> 43:10.086
l did hear him
telling other people

43:10.120 --> 43:12.918
how Junior was getting
more and more confused--

43:12.957 --> 43:15.949
calling my husband Johnny,
which was his father's name:

43:15.993 --> 43:18.154
resisting getting a haircut,
that kind of thing.

43:18.195 --> 43:21.426
You spoke with your husband
what time of the night of the incident?

43:21.465 --> 43:22.989
- l-- l don't know.
- l'm not bailing.

43:23.033 --> 43:24.762
Meadow, could you?

43:24.802 --> 43:27.896
- l'm just trying to understand.
- Understand what?

43:27.938 --> 43:31.374
You're coming out from California
to support me with my father being shot

43:31.408 --> 43:34.536
or because dental school
is just sucking for you.

43:34.578 --> 43:36.273
Both.
ls that so awful?

43:36.313 --> 43:40.181
lf you have any more questions
you're going to have to call my lawyer.

43:42.319 --> 43:43.843
When he was taken
into custody,

43:43.887 --> 43:46.355
Junior made
pointed references

43:46.390 --> 43:50.588
to the McGuire Sisters,
Sam Giancana.

43:50.628 --> 43:53.688
- You mean the Kennedy assassination?
- Yeah.

43:53.731 --> 43:55.255
You mean
as related to this?

43:55.299 --> 43:58.735
- l had to ask.
- My husband was three years old.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.676
Oh, l could sleep
right here.

44:39.143 --> 44:42.112
lt's all right.
He'll be okay.

46:03.393 --> 46:07.420
The Shelby GT 500?
450 horsepower.

46:07.464 --> 46:11.059
Oh baby, and this guy
on campus has one?

46:11.101 --> 46:13.365
And the Mustang's not
as expensive as the M3

46:13.403 --> 46:16.099
l used to talk about
getting all the time.

46:25.883 --> 46:29.080
Jennifer, another round
when you get your chance.

46:34.691 --> 46:35.715
Chris!

46:35.759 --> 46:39.422
Oh, Ahmed.
You guys here again?

46:39.463 --> 46:41.590
You ought to put up a tent
on this fucking bar.

46:41.632 --> 46:44.396
How's Tony?
The girl said he was hurt pretty bad?

46:44.434 --> 46:47.528
- He's keeping his dick up.
- His uncle did this to him?

46:47.571 --> 46:49.402
l was saying to Muhammad,
why the hell--

46:49.439 --> 46:51.031
Not something
we talk about.

46:51.074 --> 46:53.941
Please, give Tony our best
when you talk to him.

46:53.977 --> 46:56.445
l will.

47:38.989 --> 47:41.753
Hey, Dad?

47:45.963 --> 47:48.830
l'm going to get
Uncle Junior for this.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.925
Don't worry.

47:53.270 --> 47:56.068
l watched since l was little
how nice you were to him.

47:58.475 --> 48:01.035
And he doesn't just get
to do this to you,

48:02.145 --> 48:04.306
put you in here
and get away with it.

48:07.951 --> 48:09.782
You're my dad.

48:12.356 --> 48:15.154
And l'm going to put a bullet
in his fucking mummy head.

48:16.793 --> 48:19.455
l promise.

48:19.496 --> 48:21.555
l can't believe
we're not going to like,

48:21.598 --> 48:23.691
do stuff together again.

48:25.903 --> 48:28.565
'Cause we will.

48:28.605 --> 48:30.573
l'm positive.

48:37.114 --> 48:38.775
Hey.

48:38.815 --> 48:40.646
Hey.

48:40.684 --> 48:43.152
How's he doing?

48:46.623 --> 48:48.682
Hi, Dad.

48:55.332 --> 48:57.197
The doctor knows.

48:57.234 --> 48:59.395
The Chinese guy.

48:59.436 --> 49:02.928
He's calling the other guy to get
permission to change the medications.

49:04.207 --> 49:06.402
l'll stay if you want
to pee or anything.

49:19.122 --> 49:21.522
Hi.
How's he doing?

49:21.558 --> 49:23.924
They didn't come back
with the fever medicine yet.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.451
l'm so proud of you, AJ.

49:25.495 --> 49:27.360
You can't imagine how much
this means to your father.

49:27.397 --> 49:30.059
Who knows what it means?
He just lies there.

49:30.100 --> 49:32.728
Well, it means a lot to me then,
how about that?

49:32.769 --> 49:36.136
Thank you for doing it.
You've helped your family tremendously.

49:41.878 --> 49:44.506
l flunked out of school.

49:44.548 --> 49:46.948
l ended up with a 1.4
for the quarter

49:46.984 --> 49:49.851
and the freshman dean said
there was no point in coming back.

49:49.886 --> 49:53.083
- With your father in a coma--
- l didn't tell Dad.

49:53.123 --> 49:56.524
- Be positive, everybody said.
- My God.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.187
l tried really hard
in philosophy,

49:58.228 --> 50:00.628
- but that professor--
- With your father in a coma!

50:05.502 --> 50:07.697
Go have breakfast.

50:47.811 --> 50:50.507
Anthony.

50:52.582 --> 50:54.948
Anthony, can you
hear us?
