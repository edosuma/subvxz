00:07.023 --> 00:07.853
<i>Previously on</i> ER...

00:08.090 --> 00:11.583
The doctor said I may have
been HIV-positive...

00:11.828 --> 00:13.659
...for as long as 10 years.

00:13.897 --> 00:15.296
You turned down chief?

00:15.532 --> 00:16.430
Yes, I did.

00:16.666 --> 00:17.530
Al's got AIDS.

00:17.734 --> 00:19.793
We were careful,
but not that careful.

00:57.006 --> 01:00.100
17-year-old male. Multiple GSWs
to the chest and abdomen.

01:00.376 --> 01:02.310
Pulse 140 and thready. BP's 80.

01:02.579 --> 01:04.944
Stop squirming.
This fool look familiar?

01:05.181 --> 01:06.375
He got shot before.

01:06.616 --> 01:09.141
- It hurts!
- I hope so. Two times in six months.

01:09.385 --> 01:12.081
You got yourself a real slow
learning curve going.

01:29.072 --> 01:30.437
Unit 68's on the way.

01:30.707 --> 01:34.108
Drunk dove off the balcony of the
Motor Lodge, looking for the pool.

01:34.377 --> 01:36.277
- Did he find it?
- Nope.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.282
Dr. Carter, I presume.

01:40.550 --> 01:41.482
Carter, what's up?

01:41.751 --> 01:46.120
- Surgical interns meet down here?
- Yes. Your lemmings are over here.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.790
- Jerry, that lead poisoning in?
- Trauma 2.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.926
Are you gonna make it to
the Fourth of July picnic today?

01:52.162 --> 01:56.155
- My bat and glove are in my car.
- Park the guy with TB.

01:56.399 --> 01:57.627
Hey, Dr. Lewis.

01:57.834 --> 01:59.426
Carter, your first day?

01:59.669 --> 02:02.832
If you can't cut it in Surgery,
there's Family Medicine.

02:03.106 --> 02:05.336
- Or Gerontology.
- Or Psychiatry.

02:05.608 --> 02:07.098
They can't throw you out.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.845
They make you so miserable,
you beg to quit.

02:10.113 --> 02:11.273
Susan, we need you!

02:11.514 --> 02:13.311
It's only a year. You'll make it.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.144
- Guess I had better go join the group.
- Good luck.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.047
Try not to kill anyone.

02:18.288 --> 02:19.255
Surgical interns?

02:19.489 --> 02:22.049
John, Dale Edson.
Harvard Med. We met last year.

02:22.292 --> 02:23.691
- How you been?
- Great.

02:23.927 --> 02:27.226
Just spent six weeks down at Hopkins
on a Thoracic elective.

02:27.463 --> 02:29.192
Resident was a Nazi.

02:29.432 --> 02:32.128
But they let me scrub in
on 20 valve replacements.

02:32.335 --> 02:33.893
This is Julie Dixon. Duke.

02:34.137 --> 02:36.697
This is Leung Joo Hua.
UC San Francisco.

02:36.973 --> 02:38.702
And Dennis Gant. Ole Miss.

02:38.975 --> 02:40.943
LSU, actually.
They let us wear scrubs?

02:41.211 --> 02:43.304
Yeah. It's pretty
informal around here.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.878
John went to school here.
He'll show us around.

02:46.115 --> 02:49.846
- I wanna know, where's the coffee?
- Blue Team surgical interns.

02:50.086 --> 02:53.385
I'm Dr. Melvoin. Today's
the last day of my internship...

02:53.623 --> 02:55.250
...and the first day of yours.

02:55.491 --> 02:58.949
Which means, in the great game
of medical education tag, you're it.

02:59.195 --> 03:02.562
House staff guidelines.
This lists conferences and clinics...

03:02.799 --> 03:04.528
...you are required to attend.

03:04.734 --> 03:07.794
Miss one, and your evaluation
will be degraded.

03:08.037 --> 03:12.440
Vascular conference, Monday, 4 to 5.
Pathology, Monday, 5 to 7.

03:12.675 --> 03:17.169
Radiology, Tuesday at 5.
M & M's, Wednesday, 7 a.m.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.382
Intern reports,
Monday, Thursday, Friday...

03:20.617 --> 03:22.414
...at 7 a.m.

03:22.652 --> 03:27.021
Vascular Journal Club, Tuesday at 7.
Chairman's Conference, Friday, 7 a.m.

03:27.257 --> 03:29.623
The conference
and intern report conflict?

03:29.859 --> 03:34.626
Yep. You're on five days a week,
from 5 a.m. Till you finish at 7 p.m.

03:34.864 --> 03:37.765
You're on call every
third weekend and third night.

03:37.967 --> 03:41.698
Every three days, you're here
from 5 a.m. Till 7 p.m. The next day.

03:41.938 --> 03:44.133
- When do we get to sleep?
- You don't.

03:44.407 --> 03:45.271
You are wedges.

03:45.541 --> 03:48.977
The wedge is the most primitive tool
known to man. That is you.

03:49.245 --> 03:52.806
You think you know what you're doing?
Believe me, you don't.

03:53.316 --> 03:56.649
Breakfast with your senior
surgical resident, Dr. Benton...

03:56.886 --> 03:59.047
...will begin in 15 minutes.

03:59.289 --> 04:01.553
Dr. Benton is an intern's
worst nightmare.

04:01.858 --> 04:04.520
He's smarter than you.
He never eats, never sleeps.

04:04.761 --> 04:08.026
And he reads every medical journal,
no matter how obscure.

04:08.264 --> 04:12.997
He is the Antichrist, Beelzebub,
Lucifer, a devourer of wedges.

04:13.202 --> 04:17.137
You'll go to sleep at night wishing
pestilence on his unborn children.

04:17.406 --> 04:20.808
And you will wake up every morning
praying for his approval.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.807
You won't get it.

04:27.150 --> 04:29.618
Welcome to hell, ladies and gentlemen.

04:30.887 --> 04:33.515
Benton. He can't be that bad.

04:33.756 --> 04:35.053
Can he?

05:56.639 --> 05:57.833
Peter.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.174
I left a message.
You never called back.

06:04.414 --> 06:05.881
I was in surgery.

06:09.252 --> 06:10.913
I tested positive.

06:16.325 --> 06:18.156
Did you get your results back?

06:22.732 --> 06:24.131
No, I...

06:28.838 --> 06:29.862
Sometime today.

06:32.942 --> 06:35.376
I'll have to talk to
Mark Greene about it.

06:41.517 --> 06:43.417
I thought you'd wanna know.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.197
I'm sorry.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.958
There you go! Now you're
getting the hang of it.

07:26.963 --> 07:29.488
Remind me again
why we're doing this.

07:29.732 --> 07:30.630
It's fun.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.824
Oh, it's fun. Right. I forgot.

07:33.069 --> 07:34.832
All right. 10-1. Here we go.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.298
- How was that date?
- Awful.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.077
You're supposed to use your hands.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.450
Did you call Alicia?

07:54.524 --> 07:58.085
Aerobics instructor?
What are we supposed to talk about?

07:58.327 --> 07:59.954
She's an aerobics instructor!

08:00.196 --> 08:02.164
Don't you wanna talk before sex?

08:03.199 --> 08:04.257
Not really. No.

08:04.467 --> 08:06.059
Shared experiences...

08:06.302 --> 08:07.530
...common interests?

08:07.770 --> 08:09.294
You suggest you and I date?

08:10.373 --> 08:13.308
I'm just looking for
a little more than that...

08:13.643 --> 08:14.735
...in a relationship.

08:15.011 --> 08:18.811
A relationship? You're 32
years old. Have some fun!

08:19.048 --> 08:20.982
Dixon, Charcot's triad?

08:22.685 --> 08:25.017
Hypercoagulability, stasis...

08:25.254 --> 08:26.846
Pain, fever, jaundice.

08:27.089 --> 08:29.250
Gant, the ducts of Luschka?

08:30.159 --> 08:33.754
They drain bile and don't communicate
with the gallbladder lumen.

08:34.197 --> 08:36.631
An intern who wasn't
asleep during med school.

08:37.832 --> 08:41.166
Edson, this morning's patient is
jaundiced but no cholangiolitis.

08:41.404 --> 08:45.204
Should we perform the surgery
open or laparoscopically?

08:45.474 --> 08:49.843
- Open. There may be multiple stones.
- I'm going in laparoscopically.

08:50.079 --> 08:52.513
Did you get an ERCP?

08:56.919 --> 08:59.752
Okay, Edson. You scrub in.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.189
Don't you wanna ask me something?

09:02.425 --> 09:04.893
Dixon, Leung, you guys cover the ward.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.992
Gant, take the SICU.

09:07.230 --> 09:08.197
The Surgical ICU?

09:08.431 --> 09:10.956
Nurses won't let you
kill anybody. Questions?

09:11.167 --> 09:12.498
Dr. Benton?

09:13.669 --> 09:15.830
Help with the wards and cover the ER.

09:16.239 --> 09:17.035
The ER?

09:17.306 --> 09:20.275
Lastly, we need to discuss
rotation for the night shift.

09:20.543 --> 09:22.101
Dr. Benton, I was hoping...

09:22.378 --> 09:26.542
Carter, thank you for volunteering.
Take the first shift starting tonight.

09:26.782 --> 09:29.376
I'll post the schedules
in the on-call room, okay?

09:29.619 --> 09:30.643
Tonight?

09:31.921 --> 09:34.287
Surgical Ward. Four minutes.

09:38.861 --> 09:41.421
- Better start looking.
- It's just a rumor.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.792
- They're closing us down.
- Where will the patients go?

09:45.001 --> 09:47.435
It's in the <i>Trib.</i>
The mayor set up a commission.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.466
What?

09:48.704 --> 09:51.901
They're squeezing the budget,
so they're shutting us down.

09:52.174 --> 09:55.735
I read that. They said closing
County was one of the options.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.502
- They said that?
- We get fired?

09:57.780 --> 10:01.216
- Nobody's getting fired.
- I just took a second out on my house.

10:01.484 --> 10:03.418
- What's the union say?
- We got a contract.

10:03.653 --> 10:07.020
They've talked about closing us
for years, but we're still here.

10:07.256 --> 10:10.020
- You guys going to the picnic?
- I'm gonna stop by.

10:10.259 --> 10:12.193
Me too. I'll see you all later.

10:12.428 --> 10:15.454
- It was in the <i>Tribune</i> ?
<i>- Sun-Times</i> too.

10:16.065 --> 10:17.498
Oh, God.

10:19.535 --> 10:22.299
- Why are you here?
- Benton dumped me back in ER.

10:22.538 --> 10:25.871
My first day as a surgeon,
and he makes me do trauma assessments.

10:26.142 --> 10:28.201
Sounds to me like he trusts you.

10:28.477 --> 10:32.277
- Somebody beep for a Surgical consult?
- LOL in 2. 82 years old.

10:32.515 --> 10:35.177
Rule out bowel obstruction.
Benton on his way?

10:35.418 --> 10:37.886
No. I'm the Surgical consult.

10:38.688 --> 10:40.087
He'll be fine.

10:40.356 --> 10:42.153
God help the poor patients.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.985
Mark, I'm concerned about
lack of communication...

10:45.227 --> 10:47.855
...between Attendings
I noticed last year as chief.

10:48.097 --> 10:52.466
Biweekly meetings would get us
on the same page, improve patient care.

10:52.668 --> 10:55.034
Tuesdays and Thursdays
during lunch works.

10:55.271 --> 10:59.367
It'll be rough on night-shift guys,
having to be here in the afternoon.

10:59.642 --> 11:02.406
We need to adhere to
JCAHO guidelines all the time.

11:02.645 --> 11:04.636
Not just when we expect the committee.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.474
- Nurses'll hate that.
- Rules were created for a reason.

11:07.717 --> 11:12.211
Take the board for example. Patient
confidentiality is breached every day.

11:12.455 --> 11:16.186
Here, look at this entry.
"Al Johnson. Penile discharge."

11:16.425 --> 11:18.222
How would you feel if that were you?

11:18.461 --> 11:22.192
Not only are we risking lawsuits,
but we could lose our accreditation.

11:22.431 --> 11:25.889
Unit 79's bringing in
an 86-year-old male, altered LOC.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.127
I've created a diagnostic code.

11:28.371 --> 11:31.704
It's a list of a few hundred
two-letter combinations...

11:31.974 --> 11:33.965
...of common patient complaints.

11:34.243 --> 11:37.770
We can use patients' social security
numbers to protect anonymity.

11:38.047 --> 11:40.140
"BE"? Barium enema?

11:40.383 --> 11:41.680
Blunt Extremity Trauma.

11:41.917 --> 11:45.284
Some guy with a bruise will get
a radioactive colon cleansing.

11:45.521 --> 11:47.113
Mark, can I talk to you later?

11:47.356 --> 11:49.085
Yeah, sure. This afternoon?

11:49.325 --> 11:52.158
There's a conference on Saturday
at Northwestern.

11:52.395 --> 11:56.559
"Modern Architecture for Emergency
Medicine Management." We should go.

11:56.799 --> 12:00.394
Saturday I'm with my daughter.
Why don't you go and fill me in?

12:00.603 --> 12:01.968
Sure. I'll tape it.

12:04.740 --> 12:06.503
She's gotta be kidding.

12:06.942 --> 12:09.206
- What brings you in today?
- I'm sick.

12:09.445 --> 12:10.343
What's wrong?

12:10.579 --> 12:12.444
Stomach hurts.
Didn't you tell him?

12:12.681 --> 12:15.241
- When did this pain start?
- I don't know.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.416
This morning maybe?

12:16.652 --> 12:18.711
I said I don't know.
Is he an idiot?

12:18.954 --> 12:21.650
- How old are you?
- Old enough. Tell me if this hurts.

12:24.693 --> 12:26.854
- The abdomen is tender.
- I gathered that.

12:27.096 --> 12:29.826
Let's order a CBC, Chem-7
and an abdominal series.

12:30.065 --> 12:31.362
They're done.

12:31.567 --> 12:35.697
I'll check your tests, Mrs. Lukesi,
but I'm afraid you'll require surgery.

12:35.938 --> 12:38.463
You don't want to examine her
a little more?

12:38.741 --> 12:41.301
She's had previous surgery.
Probably has adhesions.

12:41.577 --> 12:42.942
You sure he's a doctor?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.943
You might consider doing a rectal.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.242
Never let the sun set
on a small bowel obstruction.

12:50.352 --> 12:53.014
May I see you for a moment?
Excuse us, ma'am.

12:54.123 --> 12:56.114
What's taking so long?
I come for an appy...

12:56.358 --> 12:58.986
...you have four patients on the board.
Did you check it?

12:59.228 --> 13:00.354
I got beeped to...

13:00.596 --> 13:04.293
Check the board first. How could you
tell this patient was emergent?

13:04.500 --> 13:06.832
Small bowel obstruction.
She'll need surgery.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.306
I'd like to scrub in on this one.

13:16.579 --> 13:21.278
Carter, all surgical abdomens require
a rectal. Even first-years know that.

13:21.517 --> 13:23.109
She's impacted.

13:24.820 --> 13:27.880
Check on the rest of your patients.
Then disimpact her.

13:28.123 --> 13:29.818
- That's a nurse's job.
- Not today.

13:33.128 --> 13:35.892
88-year-old male.
Altered LOC, hypotensive...

13:36.131 --> 13:38.622
...BP 60 palp, sinus tach at 128.

13:38.834 --> 13:41.598
Resps shallow at 30.
Skin's warm and dry.

13:41.837 --> 13:44.533
Couldn't get an IV.
O-2, four liters nasal cannula.

13:44.807 --> 13:46.365
Let's go. Trauma 1.

13:46.642 --> 13:49.304
What are all these
letters and numbers?

13:49.578 --> 13:51.045
Confidentiality system.

13:51.313 --> 13:54.248
How can I tell who's surgical
and who's medical?

13:55.084 --> 13:57.416
I don't have time!
Whose stupid idea is this?

13:57.653 --> 14:02.090
Mine. First day on the surgical
service? Nice to have you with us.

14:02.324 --> 14:04.258
Need a surgeon in 1. Is Benton in?

14:04.493 --> 14:06.427
That's you, right? Let's go.

14:06.662 --> 14:10.223
There's always a first time.
Might as well get it over with.

14:21.810 --> 14:23.539
Somebody called for a surgeon.

14:24.547 --> 14:27.277
- Drop a central line.
- I'll intubate after it's in.

14:28.350 --> 14:29.339
Pulse ox is 85.

14:29.585 --> 14:31.348
Trendelenburg, please, nurse.

14:34.356 --> 14:37.553
Central-line kit.
One percent lidocaine with epi.

14:39.094 --> 14:41.028
- Thank you, nurse.
- Intubation tray.

14:47.236 --> 14:49.636
- Angle toward the sternal notch.
- I know.

14:50.005 --> 14:51.165
Foley's in.

14:54.577 --> 14:55.737
Come on.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.776
- How are you doing over there?
- Almost.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.448
Almost.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.528
I can't find it.
Prep for a right subclavian approach.

15:21.070 --> 15:22.059
Please...

15:22.304 --> 15:23.794
Try not to hit the lung.

15:28.611 --> 15:29.407
What do we got?

15:29.645 --> 15:34.514
88-year-old male needs a central line.
I tried a right subclavian approach.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.547
- Set me up.
- I nicked his lung.

15:37.453 --> 15:40.081
- Decreased breath sounds.
- I need to intubate.

15:40.322 --> 15:41.983
His veins must've collapsed.

15:46.061 --> 15:47.858
I'm in. Stethoscope.

15:52.101 --> 15:54.535
Get Respiratory down here
to set up a vent.

15:55.304 --> 15:58.273
Congratulations, Carter.
Your patient needs a chest tube.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.236
- Chest-tube tray, 28 French.
- Ten blade.

16:02.611 --> 16:06.047
Hook me up. Hold still for
the driver. Vaseline gauze is next.

16:06.315 --> 16:07.907
Four-by-fours.
How's his pressure?

16:08.150 --> 16:09.981
- 90 systolic.
- Two liters, wide open.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.948
Temp's 103.

16:12.855 --> 16:15.483
Cefuroxime, 1.5 grams Q8.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.715
I'd cover him for Pseudomonas.

16:19.094 --> 16:20.391
Ceftazidime.

16:20.896 --> 16:23.296
Two grams Q8, plus gent.

16:23.532 --> 16:26.990
All right, people. Somebody
call up Radiology, get a stat...

16:33.308 --> 16:35.708
Listen to this.
"Pearl-white beaches...

16:35.944 --> 16:39.004
...set against an azure-blue sky.

16:39.281 --> 16:42.375
Cool breezes that make
your semi-detached bungalow...

16:42.618 --> 16:44.085
...your own little paradise."

16:44.319 --> 16:46.344
- Where's that?
- Micronesia.

16:46.588 --> 16:49.989
- Where's that?
- Who cares? It's a long way from here.

16:50.225 --> 16:52.989
"Dive with Lenny and Francis
at Fish-n-Fins...

16:53.228 --> 16:55.958
...Palau's most experienced
charter operators."

16:56.198 --> 16:57.688
Is that a shark?

16:58.033 --> 17:00.126
Five or six of them. Cool, huh?

17:00.569 --> 17:01.934
Oh, look!

17:02.171 --> 17:04.901
Hawaii! Have you ever been to Hawaii?

17:05.174 --> 17:06.641
Hawaii, South Pacific...

17:06.909 --> 17:11.073
Don't all these places require that
you fly over water at great heights?

17:11.313 --> 17:14.942
I don't care. I'll self-medicate
and sleep through the whole thing.

17:15.184 --> 17:17.778
I can't understand a thing.
What the hell is "OT"?

17:18.020 --> 17:20.853
Occupational Therapy?
Half the patients need it.

17:21.089 --> 17:23.058
Other. You put it
when you don't know.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.624
Or you're too busy to
look up the abbreviations.

17:25.861 --> 17:27.954
Give it time.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

17:28.196 --> 17:30.631
And what's "PU"?
I can't find it in the book.

17:30.833 --> 17:32.733
Pleuritic chest pain.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.828
- "EH"?
- Behavioral problems in psych.

17:37.072 --> 17:38.334
How's he do that?

17:38.607 --> 17:40.199
I reviewed the notes at lunch.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.912
Dr. Benton, some outside lab
called with test results for you.

17:44.179 --> 17:46.147
- How long ago?
- A couple hours.

17:46.415 --> 17:48.144
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

17:58.427 --> 18:00.054
Hi. You have an appointment?

18:00.295 --> 18:01.660
I thought this was walk-in.

18:01.897 --> 18:06.095
Normally, but with the holiday, things
are jammed. You here for testing?

18:06.769 --> 18:07.565
No.

18:07.803 --> 18:09.395
You are HIV-positive?

18:09.638 --> 18:11.037
- Yes.
- When did you find out?

18:11.306 --> 18:13.570
Yesterday. I'll come back later.

18:13.842 --> 18:18.108
Wait. Fill out a form, and I'll
make sure you get in to see somebody.

18:20.249 --> 18:23.685
Top form is general information.
Next pages are for insurance.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.778
Thanks.

18:47.009 --> 18:48.499
You work here?

18:50.245 --> 18:51.507
In the ER.

18:53.582 --> 18:55.311
HIV-positive?

19:09.531 --> 19:12.364
You haven't told anyone
you work with, have you?

19:12.568 --> 19:13.967
Not really.

19:16.538 --> 19:18.506
You shouldn't be here.

19:18.740 --> 19:22.972
Go someplace else for treatment,
somewhere where they don't know you.

19:27.282 --> 19:30.342
I was a surgical tech
over at Southside.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.453
Believe me, don't tell anyone
you're HIV-positive.

19:33.689 --> 19:36.214
Especially not anyone in management.

19:36.625 --> 19:37.614
They can't fire me.

19:37.860 --> 19:39.760
Not legally. No.

19:39.995 --> 19:44.898
When I came up positive four years ago,
I told the chief of surgery.

19:45.767 --> 19:50.067
They sent me to Gerontology. Wouldn't
let me do anything but take BPs.

19:50.806 --> 19:54.674
When that didn't work, they stuck me
down in Pathology working nights.

19:55.611 --> 19:59.172
After six months of that,
I finally quit.

20:00.916 --> 20:02.611
Been there for eight years.

20:06.822 --> 20:09.188
There's a real good clinic
in Highland Park.

20:09.424 --> 20:12.655
It's a long drive,
but it'd be a lot safer.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.863
I'm sorry if I'm scaring you.

20:20.102 --> 20:21.262
Matthew?

20:25.140 --> 20:27.005
I'm Matt Hymes.
What's your name?

20:28.543 --> 20:31.910
Maybe I should give you an alias.
Jeanie Boulet.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.712
Get out of here, Jeanie.
Don't ever come back.

20:43.959 --> 20:46.393
This is Dr. Benton over at County.

20:47.963 --> 20:51.592
You have the results of an AIDS test
for a patient of mine.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.298
I know it's late.

20:55.103 --> 20:59.199
I don't want the patient to agonize
over this thing over the weekend.

21:01.076 --> 21:03.010
I'd really appreciate it.

21:03.912 --> 21:06.210
The patient's name is Benjamin.

21:06.448 --> 21:08.040
Peter Benjamin.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.716
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

21:18.493 --> 21:20.256
Yeah, I'm still here.

21:28.303 --> 21:29.361
Thank you.

21:34.309 --> 21:35.401
Thank you.

21:51.593 --> 21:55.051
Dr. Benton, I'm caught up,
and my night shift doesn't start...

21:55.297 --> 21:57.265
...for a half-hour. Should I go eat?

21:57.466 --> 21:59.559
Take 10 minutes, then find Melvoin.

21:59.801 --> 22:02.964
- Ten minutes.
- That's more than you'll usually get.

22:03.205 --> 22:04.194
You with me tonight?

22:04.473 --> 22:07.340
No. Karubian's the Resident on call.

22:09.277 --> 22:10.073
You okay?

22:21.056 --> 22:22.751
I'm fine, Carter.

22:27.062 --> 22:28.290
Going to the picnic?

22:28.530 --> 22:31.260
Are you kidding?
Last year six at bats, 15 RBIs.

22:31.466 --> 22:33.127
I love to play the Pede's unit.

22:33.368 --> 22:35.632
We're playing the paramedics
this year.

22:35.871 --> 22:37.236
Finally? Who set that up?

22:37.506 --> 22:40.031
It was either that or the Orthopods.

22:40.308 --> 22:44.335
Ortho's got two ex-All-Americans and
one retired minor league shortstop.

22:44.613 --> 22:47.377
If you're going to the picnic,
pick up more chicken.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.881
Darcy called. Her kid's sick.
She can't work tonight.

22:51.887 --> 22:54.617
- Anybody wanna pull a double?
- On the Fourth of July?

22:54.856 --> 22:58.257
Come on, guys.
Please? Somebody?

22:58.527 --> 23:01.496
- I'm playing right field.
- It's tough being boss, huh?

23:01.730 --> 23:03.755
You could always quit again.

23:04.199 --> 23:06.759
I can cover for a few hours
if you come back by 10.

23:07.002 --> 23:08.697
- Thanks, Lily.
- Where you going?

23:08.937 --> 23:11.804
- Barbecue and softball game.
- Everybody's going?

23:12.074 --> 23:14.599
- I'm coming back.
- Bring me some barbecue.

23:14.876 --> 23:17.401
- Anything else, doctor?
- Chicken, no dark meat.

23:17.679 --> 23:20.170
And beans and lots of coleslaw.

23:20.449 --> 23:22.781
- Carter's getting a little uppity.
- Really.

23:23.018 --> 23:26.681
- He may need a little potty training.
- I'd be delighted.

23:29.524 --> 23:30.957
Last day, huh?

23:31.193 --> 23:35.994
My vacation begins in 14 minutes
and 24 seconds. I set my watch.

23:36.231 --> 23:37.391
Fourth of July.

23:37.599 --> 23:39.226
You're in for a treat tonight.

23:39.468 --> 23:41.993
Knife and Gun Club
should get going later.

23:42.237 --> 23:43.670
- Where we going?
- Surgical wards.

23:43.905 --> 23:46.635
- Why?
- You're covering them tonight.

23:47.542 --> 23:49.510
- I'm covering the ER.
- That too.

23:49.778 --> 23:53.009
And the SICU. O.R. Prep
if the Resident needs you.

23:53.248 --> 23:56.877
Trauma team, Pre-Op
and all the surgical admits.

24:10.432 --> 24:12.525
Look what the cat dragged in.

24:14.836 --> 24:15.928
Got a good turnout.

24:16.171 --> 24:19.732
You know this neighborhood.
Mention food, and they come running.

24:22.144 --> 24:23.076
I'm glad you came.

24:23.345 --> 24:24.607
I said I was gonna come.

24:24.846 --> 24:28.247
I figured you were lying, like always.

24:30.185 --> 24:31.413
Why are you so happy?

24:31.887 --> 24:33.047
I can't be happy?

24:38.693 --> 24:40.422
You knew she was coming.

24:41.997 --> 24:43.464
That's why you showed up.

24:44.866 --> 24:47.960
Jackie, how many times I gotta
tell you we're just friends?

24:50.305 --> 24:51.567
Can I get you a drink?

24:53.742 --> 24:55.710
Yeah. Some juice.

24:57.612 --> 24:59.443
I know what I'm doing.

24:59.681 --> 25:01.114
Hey, man. What's up, doc?

25:01.383 --> 25:03.851
This crazy woman thinks
she knows how to grill.

25:04.719 --> 25:07.586
Get out of here. Bald men
don't know how to barbecue.

25:07.822 --> 25:12.350
She's mad because I'm a big, black,
bald, beautiful, barbecue-cooking man.

25:13.028 --> 25:15.428
I'm gonna get some chicken.
I'll be back.

25:15.664 --> 25:16.460
All right, Wally.

25:16.698 --> 25:18.131
I want my place back!

25:21.303 --> 25:25.103
- How are you doing?
- Pass me that plate over there.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.604
You look good.

25:31.746 --> 25:34.180
You don't come around
the restaurant no more.

25:36.685 --> 25:37.481
I gave up meat.

25:37.719 --> 25:40.711
I heard that about you. I did.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.049
Those long hours
you been working, I bet.

25:44.159 --> 25:47.185
Yeah. Keeps me pretty busy, you know.

25:47.429 --> 25:48.987
It's a shame.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.861
No time for old friends.

25:58.173 --> 25:59.936
I get an hour here and there.

26:00.842 --> 26:04.107
Well, it only takes an hour, Peter.

26:05.380 --> 26:07.371
Or don't you remember?

26:11.853 --> 26:12.979
Oh, man.

26:13.521 --> 26:14.715
Jeanie.

26:16.858 --> 26:18.382
- How you feeling?
- I'm fine.

26:18.627 --> 26:21.221
- And how's your husband?
- He's doing all right.

26:21.463 --> 26:22.657
Good. That's great.

26:25.367 --> 26:26.527
Did you get that test?

26:30.372 --> 26:31.304
It was negative.

26:31.573 --> 26:32.369
That's great.

26:35.677 --> 26:39.443
I won't keep you any longer.
I'm glad the news was good.

26:44.052 --> 26:46.077
Let's go, Jer. Lock on the ball!

26:59.067 --> 27:00.261
Safe!

27:00.869 --> 27:02.461
Who told Jerry to pitch?

27:03.238 --> 27:04.102
- 17-3.
- Let's go!

27:05.206 --> 27:07.902
Why don't we forfeit
and get back to drinking?

27:08.176 --> 27:10.667
Jerry! Come on. 17-3.
We're still in it.

27:10.945 --> 27:13.209
Let's go! 17-3!
We're still in this.

27:13.448 --> 27:14.813
Jer, come on!

27:15.083 --> 27:15.947
We're in it.

27:16.851 --> 27:18.216
Let's spin that ball!

27:23.491 --> 27:25.049
I got it! I got it!

27:25.293 --> 27:26.555
I got it!

27:27.862 --> 27:31.195
That's a momentum swing.
This is our inning. Let's go!

27:38.907 --> 27:40.101
You playing?

27:40.508 --> 27:42.942
I don't know. I just got off work.

27:43.278 --> 27:45.337
My guys are doing okay without me.

27:45.613 --> 27:47.444
Your guys are kicking our butts.

27:48.817 --> 27:50.341
Your boom box is at my house.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.143
I got a new one.

27:53.988 --> 27:56.582
My old one have my
<i>Best of Conway Twitty</i> tape in it?

27:56.825 --> 27:58.156
If it did, I'd burn it.

27:58.793 --> 28:00.317
What happened to my beer?

28:02.664 --> 28:07.101
Vicki Pastroni, this is Carol Hathaway.
She's the head nurse at County.

28:07.302 --> 28:08.234
Nice to meet you.

28:12.674 --> 28:15.108
Greene's gonna try
to make a game of this one.

28:16.010 --> 28:17.602
Maybe I'd better go warm up.

28:29.524 --> 28:30.320
You all right?

28:34.696 --> 28:35.993
Fireworks!

28:57.619 --> 29:00.315
Oh, I love fireworks.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.081
Me too.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.483
They're beautiful.

29:03.725 --> 29:06.285
If we're all here, who's at work?

29:08.062 --> 29:09.393
I don't know.

29:10.932 --> 29:12.365
I don't care.

29:16.070 --> 29:18.300
Dr. Carter, get one A-V.

29:18.573 --> 29:20.632
Step up here, Dr. Carter.

29:20.942 --> 29:22.671
He's arrested.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.410
Thoracotomy tray.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.978
Make the incision deep and fast.

29:28.216 --> 29:29.513
Spreader.

29:31.286 --> 29:32.913
Vascular clamp.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.427
- Dr. Carter?
- I'm up.

29:43.698 --> 29:44.494
What?

29:44.699 --> 29:48.066
Mrs. Nuprik's temp's up to 100.
Can we give her Tylenol?

29:48.436 --> 29:52.372
- How long have I been asleep?
- About 10 minutes. Tylenol?

29:53.441 --> 29:54.908
- Yeah, great.
- Two?

29:55.176 --> 29:56.666
Two. Right.

30:04.319 --> 30:05.752
Dr. Carter?

30:05.987 --> 30:09.718
Can we give Mr. Sifkin some toast?
He's asking for something to eat.

30:09.958 --> 30:12.256
- Sifkin?
- Leg lac?

30:13.528 --> 30:15.052
Toast okay?

30:15.630 --> 30:18.428
Toast, oatmeal, prime rib, whatever.

30:18.633 --> 30:20.430
Thank you, doctor.

30:22.303 --> 30:23.736
Toast.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.508
Do you want a stool culture on
Mrs. Haney? She's got diarrhea.

30:31.746 --> 30:34.180
Haney? That's Weaver's
patient, right?

30:34.415 --> 30:37.179
- What does she say?
- She's upstairs getting coffee.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.079
- What would you do?
- Not bother.

30:39.320 --> 30:42.289
- Let's not bother then, okay?
- Thank you, doctor.

30:42.690 --> 30:43.952
Haleh.

30:44.626 --> 30:47.026
It's always like this
when somebody's sleeping?

30:47.262 --> 30:51.699
I wouldn't know, doctor. Nurses
aren't allowed to sleep on shift.

31:13.454 --> 31:16.548
- Should I beep him again?
- Only if he doesn't come out.

31:16.991 --> 31:17.787
Bingo!

31:18.026 --> 31:20.392
Cops bringing in a drunk.
Fell through a window.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.721
Find a bed.
This guy's growing roots.

31:22.964 --> 31:26.900
Resident says there's no beds, because
he doesn't wanna work anybody up.

31:27.101 --> 31:29.092
Good morning, Dr. Carter.
Get any sleep?

31:29.337 --> 31:31.703
Somebody beeped me? You, Ray?

31:31.973 --> 31:33.531
No. Maybe another floor?

31:33.808 --> 31:38.006
- 6195. That's the ER, isn't it?
- Yes, but I didn't page you.

31:38.246 --> 31:40.646
Must've been some kind of mistake.

31:40.882 --> 31:43.442
They can make your life
easy or miserable.

31:43.685 --> 31:46.245
Whatever you did,
I suggest you apologize.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.512
- I didn't do anything.
- Apologize anyway.

31:48.756 --> 31:52.283
Police are bringing in a drunk.
Went through a plate-glass window.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.185
This guy was busting windows
with his fist.

31:55.430 --> 31:58.092
Tried to bust a display at The Gap
but couldn't.

31:58.299 --> 32:01.393
So he went over across
the street. Went right through.

32:01.636 --> 32:03.866
We found him in Women's Underwear.

32:07.709 --> 32:09.040
Could someone help me out?

32:16.050 --> 32:17.711
I got him! I got him!

32:20.788 --> 32:22.756
Clean it up and check his tetanus.

32:22.991 --> 32:26.188
And prepare him for suturing,
lots of suturing.

32:26.427 --> 32:28.190
That'll take the rest of the night.

32:28.429 --> 32:32.331
- Dr. Carter! Conni! I need you.
- Let me know when he's ready.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.267
Elderly man vomiting blood.

32:34.502 --> 32:39.166
BP 100 over 70. Pulse is thready
at 145. Two IVs in the field.

32:39.440 --> 32:41.067
- He's yellow.
- Don't we know him?

32:41.342 --> 32:44.106
Jim. A regular.
Alcoholic, cirrhosis, seizures.

32:46.014 --> 32:47.345
He's drunk.

32:49.617 --> 32:50.914
Let's move him.

32:51.152 --> 32:53.052
Gently, now. One.

32:53.287 --> 32:54.413
Two.

32:54.656 --> 32:55.554
Three.

32:56.658 --> 32:57.852
He's got a scalp lac.

32:58.092 --> 33:00.788
Found him in the gutter.
He may have hit his head.

33:01.029 --> 33:03.964
- What's that smell?
- Code brown in the shorts. Blood too.

33:04.165 --> 33:07.862
CBC, type and cross,
four units, coag panel.

33:08.102 --> 33:10.332
Dr. Carter, help us with an NG.

33:10.571 --> 33:12.368
Hang the banana bag wide open.

33:12.640 --> 33:15.438
- I'm ready for you, Dr. Carter.
- Hold still, sir.

33:15.677 --> 33:17.144
What's your surgical plan?

33:17.412 --> 33:20.074
Transfuse and take him to
the GI lab for endoscopy.

33:20.314 --> 33:22.339
- Cauterize bleeding sites.
- Sounds right.

33:22.884 --> 33:23.714
Did you hear me?

33:23.951 --> 33:26.613
Damn it, Malik! I'll be
there as soon as I can!

33:31.993 --> 33:32.789
Sure.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.793
Take your time.

33:35.830 --> 33:37.263
Burn victims on their way.

33:37.465 --> 33:40.662
Set up 1 and alert Plastic.
They'll be right there.

33:42.804 --> 33:44.863
Don't look at us.
We're working here.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.937
- Tube's in.
- What's 1019?

33:47.208 --> 33:49.108
Surgical ICU.

33:50.878 --> 33:53.278
This is John Carter.
You just paged me.

33:53.915 --> 33:57.316
How many days since the surgery?
All right, I'll be right over.

33:57.919 --> 34:00.888
Post-op, day two. Triple-A repair.
Guy's desatting.

34:01.122 --> 34:04.558
Don't be gone long, doctor.
We're getting buried down here.

34:30.784 --> 34:32.275
Can I help you?

34:34.989 --> 34:36.456
I'm Dr. Carter.

34:38.059 --> 34:41.290
66-year-old male. Abdominal
aneurysm repaired two days ago.

34:41.529 --> 34:45.397
Dropped his crit. I don't know if
he's leaking or if he's hemodiluted.

34:46.134 --> 34:49.534
- What do you think?
- I hope he's not bleeding out.

34:49.937 --> 34:51.734
Should we transfuse or diurese?

34:52.005 --> 34:53.166
That's why I called you.

34:55.476 --> 34:58.070
- What's his crit?
- 30. It was 33 an hour ago.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.712
Haven't seen your Resident.
He's asleep?

35:00.948 --> 35:03.439
- What time does he get up?
- Sometime after 5.

35:04.318 --> 35:05.808
That's two hours.

35:06.487 --> 35:07.283
Two hours.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.392
Do you wanna wait and see
how low his crit goes?

35:14.796 --> 35:18.061
If I don't transfuse and he's
bleeding out, he'll go into shock.

35:18.266 --> 35:22.498
And if I diurese and I'm wrong,
he'll go into renal failure, right?

35:25.740 --> 35:29.870
It's the ER, 911.
Where's Dr. Karubian sleeping?

35:32.480 --> 35:33.447
Dr. Karubian?

35:33.714 --> 35:37.013
It better be important, or you'll
be draining rectal abscesses...

35:37.251 --> 35:39.082
...for the rest of your Residency.

35:39.320 --> 35:43.484
Post-op, day two. Aneurysm repair.
Crit's 30, sat's down to 90.

35:43.724 --> 35:46.454
- Is he on oxygen?
- Nasal cannula. Yes, sir.

35:46.694 --> 35:49.424
Try a mask. Check his crit
again in half an hour.

35:49.664 --> 35:50.756
Thank you, sir.

35:50.965 --> 35:52.557
It's Carter, right?

35:52.800 --> 35:53.732
Yes. Right, sir.

35:53.968 --> 35:57.028
All right. Shut up, Carter,
and close the door.

35:59.640 --> 36:03.041
Fifteen liters oxygen by mask,
and call me in half an hour.

36:05.213 --> 36:07.044
- What's going on?
- Third-degree burns.

36:07.281 --> 36:08.976
Kid was playing with fireworks.

36:09.217 --> 36:10.912
Pulse ox is 65 on 100% O-2.

36:11.152 --> 36:13.620
Nice of you to join us.
Where you been?

36:13.855 --> 36:17.951
- I was up in the SICU.
- Acute pulmonary edema. Six ET tube.

36:18.226 --> 36:20.353
Versed. Guy next door's in trouble.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.962
Go! When I page 911, I want you
out of breath when you show up!

36:24.365 --> 36:26.424
- What's going on?
- He's taching at 200.

36:26.868 --> 36:28.768
- What?
- No palpable BP. Looks like SVT.

36:29.003 --> 36:30.300
Cardiovert, right?

36:30.872 --> 36:32.601
- How much?
- I'd start at 50.

36:32.874 --> 36:35.775
Hit the synch switch.
All right, everybody off!

36:37.778 --> 36:39.268
A hundred. Off!

36:42.817 --> 36:43.613
Okay, sinus.

36:43.851 --> 36:44.943
BP 70 palp.
Dopamine?

36:48.990 --> 36:50.514
- Dopamine?
- I don't know!

36:50.758 --> 36:52.055
Somebody call a doctor!

36:52.293 --> 36:53.851
You are the doctor.

36:59.934 --> 37:00.992
Right. Dopamine.

37:01.235 --> 37:05.069
Titrate to a systolic of 100.

37:05.740 --> 37:09.836
I can do this. He's not breathing.
We have to intubate. 7.5 now.

37:10.111 --> 37:11.100
IV's blown.

37:11.379 --> 37:13.347
In a minute. I got it.

37:14.248 --> 37:15.647
Let me get in there.

37:19.954 --> 37:21.421
Need any help in here?

37:21.656 --> 37:22.884
Early, aren't you?

37:23.124 --> 37:25.888
I couldn't sleep.
Figured you could use a hand.

37:26.127 --> 37:29.221
Get a third line started.
IV's blown. Bag him.

37:31.866 --> 37:34.699
- What's wrong with him?
- Alcoholic, GI bleed...

37:34.936 --> 37:37.530
...history of cirrhosis,
possible subdural hematoma.

37:37.772 --> 37:39.330
- Had to cardiovert.
- You're kidding.

37:39.607 --> 37:43.441
Zapped him twice. Got him back.
He went apneic, and I had to tube him.

37:43.678 --> 37:44.474
Your first night?

37:44.712 --> 37:48.239
I haven't even told you about the guy
who desatted in the SICU.

37:53.587 --> 37:56.317
Interns' breakfast starts
in a couple minutes.

37:56.757 --> 37:58.816
Last ones.

38:00.561 --> 38:02.859
- Breakfast.
- Right.

38:03.097 --> 38:05.930
This year I'll associate
omelets and oatmeal...

38:06.133 --> 38:08.465
...with a deep sense
of personal inadequacy.

38:09.603 --> 38:13.095
- How many sutures have we put in him?
- I lost count. Hundreds.

38:13.374 --> 38:14.136
At least.

38:15.643 --> 38:17.133
How you holding up?

38:18.879 --> 38:20.574
I'm really tired.

38:23.918 --> 38:27.081
But I can look on the bright side.
I'm off in 13 hours.

38:28.422 --> 38:29.514
I'm on tonight.

38:29.757 --> 38:32.453
- Thanks for coming in to help.
- It's no problem.

38:35.663 --> 38:36.595
We're done.

38:37.331 --> 38:40.823
Well, then I guess it's time for
our early morning humiliation.

38:41.569 --> 38:42.934
Benton's breakfast it is.

38:43.170 --> 38:46.799
Just in time too. I was starting
to feel too good about myself.

38:57.985 --> 38:59.612
Did you get your test back?

39:06.794 --> 39:07.852
It was negative.

39:10.664 --> 39:11.653
That's good.

39:13.234 --> 39:14.428
I'm glad.

39:17.171 --> 39:18.365
Have you told anyone?

39:18.606 --> 39:19.834
About my test? No.

39:20.107 --> 39:21.404
About me.

39:24.845 --> 39:27.245
Good. I don't want you to.

39:27.481 --> 39:29.540
I've decided not to tell anyone.

39:32.019 --> 39:33.384
Greene told you to do that?

39:33.621 --> 39:37.489
No. It's a personal decision.
I'd appreciate it if you'd honor it.

39:39.927 --> 39:42.657
Jeanie, are you asking me
to lie for you?

39:42.897 --> 39:45.832
No. I'm asking you
to keep your mouth shut.

39:46.033 --> 39:47.694
I don't know if I can do that.

39:47.935 --> 39:49.698
Fine. Thanks for your support.

39:50.805 --> 39:51.601
Come here.

40:00.081 --> 40:01.810
You plan to keep on practicing?

40:02.049 --> 40:04.210
I don't know.
I don't want my personal life...

40:04.452 --> 40:06.977
...spread around the hospital.
Is that asking too much?

40:07.221 --> 40:08.188
I don't know.

40:08.789 --> 40:09.756
Right.

40:16.430 --> 40:20.161
- We need to formalize chart review.
- Why would we wanna do that?

40:20.367 --> 40:21.356
Quality assurance.

40:21.602 --> 40:25.163
Residents can't improve their
diagnostic skills without feedback.

40:25.406 --> 40:29.035
Our Residents' diagnostic skills
are terrific the way they are.

40:29.310 --> 40:31.710
They need vacation, not supervision.

40:31.946 --> 40:34.141
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

40:34.381 --> 40:38.750
It's just a suggestion. We'll discuss
it at the Tuesday Attendings meeting.

40:38.986 --> 40:41.580
- What Tuesday Attendings meeting?
- Memo in your box.

40:41.822 --> 40:46.156
What's up with this board?
Is it gonna stay like this forever?

40:46.827 --> 40:47.851
No, it's not.

40:48.095 --> 40:52.225
Come on, Jerry. Let's put the
patients' last names back up here.

40:52.433 --> 40:55.561
And let's list their
complaints in English, please.

40:56.170 --> 40:58.730
Yes, I promise I'll give
him the message.

40:59.740 --> 41:01.207
Bye, now. Bye-bye.

41:01.475 --> 41:04.273
- Ross in yet? That girl called again.
- What girl?

41:04.512 --> 41:06.912
Every five minutes.
She's driving me crazy.

41:07.148 --> 41:08.911
Are you crazy, Randi?

41:09.150 --> 41:11.880
Gretchen's called 50 times.
It's not even 7 a.m.

41:12.119 --> 41:12.915
Thank you.

41:13.154 --> 41:16.146
Call her. I'm not your secretary.
I've got work to do.

41:16.390 --> 41:17.982
- Another stewardess?
- No.

41:18.225 --> 41:20.022
- Waitress?
- Hatcheck girl?

41:20.261 --> 41:22.286
You all think you know me so well.

41:22.530 --> 41:23.895
That's because we do.

41:24.098 --> 41:27.659
Gretchen's a mergers and acquisitions
specialist at First National.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.564
She went to Smith and Yale Law.

41:30.804 --> 41:32.396
She's a Rhodes scholar.

41:32.673 --> 41:36.700
Smith, wow! Most of the women
you date can't even spell "Smith."

41:37.711 --> 41:40.271
- I'm shocked.
- Well, I'm full of surprises.

41:40.548 --> 41:42.482
When do we meet
this Renaissance woman?

41:44.151 --> 41:45.118
A Rhodes scholar?

41:46.220 --> 41:47.687
Carter have a nice night?

41:47.922 --> 41:48.718
Oh, yeah.

41:48.956 --> 41:52.084
He'll fetch, heel, roll over
and play dead if you ask him.

41:52.326 --> 41:54.521
Doughnut?
I bought them for the nurses.

41:54.762 --> 41:57.356
Chocolate. Why, thank you, doctor.

41:57.565 --> 42:00.830
- Carter, come. I need you.
- Doughnut, Dr. Benton?

42:01.068 --> 42:05.300
Dr. Karubian said you woke him up
asking him how to work an oxygen mask.

42:05.539 --> 42:08.133
It was a little bit more
complicated than that.

42:08.409 --> 42:10.843
- Carter, where's your tie?
- Long story.

42:11.078 --> 42:13.444
- No time for that.
- Five flights?

42:13.681 --> 42:16.115
I hope you had
plenty of rest last night.

42:23.057 --> 42:26.117
- Gretchen, what are you doing?
- I've been calling you.

42:26.360 --> 42:27.418
I've been busy.

42:27.661 --> 42:30.653
The store's doing inventory.
I hoped we could have lunch.

42:30.864 --> 42:32.855
Today I can't. I'm sorry.

42:36.670 --> 42:39.400
Listen, I gotta get back
to my patients, okay?

42:39.673 --> 42:41.197
Why don't you come over later?

42:41.475 --> 42:45.206
I don't wanna come over. I wanna
meet your friends, go to dinner.

42:45.446 --> 42:50.281
Listen to me. That's gonna happen.
Right now I gotta get back to work.

42:50.517 --> 42:51.984
When will it happen?

42:52.219 --> 42:54.710
Tonight we'll go to dinner.
7:00, all right?

42:55.322 --> 42:57.415
You pick the place. Okay?

42:58.659 --> 43:01.150
Okay, bye. I now have to
go to work, okay?

43:02.863 --> 43:04.125
I'll see you.

43:04.498 --> 43:05.624
- 7:00?
- Yeah, 7:00.

43:12.573 --> 43:13.767
Gretchen?

43:15.042 --> 43:19.274
No. She's just somebody
that I haven't seen in a long time.

43:23.117 --> 43:25.085
Jerry, don't you have
some work to do?

43:30.491 --> 43:32.857
Gretchen, hi. It's Doug.
You just left here.

43:33.093 --> 43:36.551
I'm sorry. I just realized I can't
have dinner with you tonight.

43:36.797 --> 43:40.198
I'm swamped, and I just forgot.
I'm sorry.

43:40.401 --> 43:44.599
I'll talk to you in a couple
of days, okay? Bye-bye.

44:17.171 --> 44:20.937
Someone left some sparklers
in the Trauma Room. You want them?

44:25.879 --> 44:29.576
I heard you caught another
central line. Any trouble?

44:29.817 --> 44:32.217
No, I hit it the first time.

44:32.453 --> 44:33.977
That's the way it is.

44:34.221 --> 44:38.954
Sometimes you can't find them.
Other times they are right there.

44:45.699 --> 44:48.259
I haven't seen one of these
since I was a kid.

44:53.607 --> 44:55.234
It's me. It's me.

44:55.509 --> 44:58.910
- You're a very popular guy.
- It's the ER.

44:59.146 --> 45:00.636
I'll go check it out.

45:01.582 --> 45:04.176
- Get some more fresh air.
- Thanks.

45:08.055 --> 45:10.649
Carter, how much longer you on?

45:10.891 --> 45:12.324
Two hours.

45:13.193 --> 45:14.421
You're gonna make it.
