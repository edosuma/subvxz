00:01.468 --> 00:03.435
<i>[Joseph] It's the first time that
Jigsaw is meeting our female, Zee Zee.</i>

00:03.437 --> 00:06.105
<i>- [Coleen] She's coming out.
- [Cassy] She's walking out.</i>

00:06.107 --> 00:08.173
-[Coleen] <i>She's not even looking.
-[Cassy] Nope.</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:09.274
[laughing]

00:09.676 --> 00:12.444
<i>[woman] Good job, monkey!</i>

00:12.446 --> 00:14.713
<i>Right now we have one langur,
his name is Kip.</i>

00:14.748 --> 00:16.448
[Juliet] Hi, Kip.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.684
[Alisha] He's getting taken
care of at the health center.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.752
[Juliet] Hi, doll!

00:22.522 --> 00:24.857
<i>[Casey] Of course,
our white-naped crane chick</i>

00:24.859 --> 00:27.760
<i>that hatched this year, there's
only about 5,000 left in the wild,</i>

00:27.762 --> 00:29.828
so every time
that we can raise one,

00:29.830 --> 00:31.397
it's incredibly important
for the species.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.899
Got him!

00:36.836 --> 00:39.705
<i>[Jim] If you ask a child
to draw a picture of a zoo,</i>

00:39.707 --> 00:42.975
<i>chances are they'll draw
an animal behind bars.</i>

00:42.977 --> 00:46.011
We have to take that image
and change it.

00:46.513 --> 00:47.779
Bringing joy, this is it.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.983
<i>[man] Strengthens the bond
that we have with these guys.</i>

00:50.985 --> 00:53.218
-Come on.
-[man] I know. He doesn't like doors.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.319
[woman] Come on, ladies.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.688
<i>[Jim] It's not enough
to keep animals at exhibit</i>

00:56.690 --> 00:57.523
<i>just for people to look at.</i>

00:57.525 --> 00:59.892
<i>There has to be
a higher purpose.</i>

00:59.894 --> 01:02.861
<i>And, for us, it's conservation
of species in the wild.</i>

01:02.929 --> 01:04.797
Keep rolling.

01:04.799 --> 01:07.132
<i>[Jim] The general public
would never get the access</i>

01:07.134 --> 01:07.599
<i>you're going to get.</i>

01:07.601 --> 01:09.068
[woman] Girl!

01:09.602 --> 01:12.905
<i>[Jim] Which is to see what goes
on behind the scenes everyday.</i>

01:12.907 --> 01:14.840
That's what we do here,
in the boogie down Bronx.

01:14.874 --> 01:16.975
[laughing]

01:21.047 --> 01:22.581
- [visitor 1] There it is.
- [visitor 2] Oh, cool.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.149
How cute.

01:28.121 --> 01:32.224
[Alisha] I'm heading down to go
turn on our waterfalls park exhibit.

01:34.194 --> 01:35.327
<i>We have three waterfalls.</i>

01:38.498 --> 01:42.034
Inside this door, we have
the silver leaf langur.

01:42.036 --> 01:43.769
<i>The silver langurs
have specific keepers,</i>

01:43.771 --> 01:45.804
<i>and I'm their lead keeper.</i>

01:45.806 --> 01:48.874
I kind of like to feel like
I'm a part of their troop.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.310
Hi, Bernie.
How are you doing?

01:52.045 --> 01:53.745
Oh, my goodness.
Hi, sweetheart.

01:53.747 --> 01:54.746
What is that?

01:54.748 --> 01:55.814
<i>When I talk to animals,</i>

01:55.816 --> 01:57.749
specially ones
that I really love,

01:57.751 --> 01:59.918
my voice tends to go
really high-pitched

01:59.920 --> 02:01.420
and squeaky and excited.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.322
Want to go outside to play?

02:04.624 --> 02:07.860
<i>If you have an excited tone
versus a scary tone,</i>

02:07.862 --> 02:11.063
or your hands are crushed
or you're staring directly

02:11.065 --> 02:13.098
into their eyes,
they read off of that.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.266
Who's my bae?

02:16.903 --> 02:18.203
They'll shift.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.442
Woah, good job!
There you go.

02:25.445 --> 02:28.947
Silver langurs are arboreal,
so they're up high,

02:28.949 --> 02:32.384
jumping from branch to branch
and from tree to tree.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.287
Good job, monkeys!

02:42.695 --> 02:44.396
<i>I could watch them all day.</i>

02:45.732 --> 02:47.933
<i>I just love to see
their reactions,</i>

02:47.935 --> 02:49.468
<i>who is grooming who.</i>

02:50.570 --> 02:53.205
<i>Who's being
a little trickster to who.</i>

02:54.507 --> 02:56.909
<i>It's like kind of watching
your kid at daycare.</i>

02:56.911 --> 02:58.877
You know, you want to see
what kind of interactions

02:58.879 --> 03:01.013
they're having with each other.

03:02.882 --> 03:04.416
<i>Right now we have
one langur missing,</i>

03:04.418 --> 03:05.584
<i>his name is Kip.</i>

03:05.586 --> 03:08.220
<i>He's getting taken care of
at the health center.</i>

03:13.326 --> 03:17.996
Kip is our almost 1-year-old
silver langur in Jungle World.

03:20.767 --> 03:24.002
[Sara] <i>On Friday, he started
having some nasal discharge,</i>

03:24.004 --> 03:25.804
on top of looking lethargic.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.372
[Dr. Drumm] Alright, buddy.

03:28.007 --> 03:29.841
<i>Before bringing Kip
to the hospital,</i>

03:29.843 --> 03:31.610
<i>we did a really throughout exam,</i>

03:31.612 --> 03:33.779
but we also give him
some supportive care,

03:33.781 --> 03:36.415
some injectable antibiotics,
some fluids.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.550
That's helped him feel better.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.753
<i>And based on the fact that he
just was not responding</i>

03:41.755 --> 03:44.957
<i>to the initial medications
we've given him,</i>

03:44.959 --> 03:46.425
we knew he was very sick

03:46.427 --> 03:49.361
and that he needed
more aggressive care.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.929
Okay, take the mask away.

03:50.931 --> 03:54.433
<i>So, we're doing a procedure
now to reevaluate him,</i>

03:54.435 --> 03:55.734
<i>see where we're at.</i>

03:55.736 --> 03:58.403
<i>I'm worried
that he has severe diarrhea,</i>

03:58.405 --> 04:00.806
and very concerned
that he's suffering

04:00.808 --> 04:04.076
from severe electrolytes
draingments due to that diarrhea.

04:04.078 --> 04:04.910
There we go.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.678
<i>And, secondary to that,</i>

04:06.680 --> 04:09.848
he became
what I suspect is sceptic,

04:09.850 --> 04:11.083
so he actually
developed an infection

04:11.085 --> 04:13.185
that went throughout his body.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.153
[Sara]
Okay, let's do bloodwork.

04:19.759 --> 04:20.692
Sodium is better.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.160
Potassium still low.

04:22.162 --> 04:24.596
[Dr. Drumm]
Yeah, sodium is much better.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.098
Chloride is better too.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.899
[man]
So, the electrolyte is better.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.302
[Sara] Yeah. Yeah,
he's definitely improved.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.704
His potassium is still
too low to our register,

04:32.706 --> 04:34.206
but his sodium
as chloride are up.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.474
[Dr. Drumm] Oh, that's good.

04:37.944 --> 04:42.281
<i>Kip is responding over the
course of even just today.</i>

04:43.016 --> 04:45.117
I think the things
we've provided,

04:45.119 --> 04:46.785
we started to see
some improvement.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.153
Alright.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.789
<i>His potassium
is still too low to read,</i>

04:50.791 --> 04:52.991
and that's not good,

04:52.993 --> 04:54.893
but it tells me that we need
to be more aggressive

04:54.895 --> 04:56.795
<i>in our care of him.</i>

04:56.797 --> 04:59.931
<i>I think he really needs
some IV antibiotics</i>

04:59.933 --> 05:03.101
<i>to fight whatever
he's dealing with.</i>

05:03.103 --> 05:04.502
- Suture this place.
- [Sara] Yeah.

05:04.504 --> 05:07.172
[Dr. Drumm] <i>I certainly don't
want to pull him away from mom,</i>

05:07.174 --> 05:09.875
<i>I certainly don't want to pull him
away from his troop if I don't have to,</i>

05:09.877 --> 05:11.276
<i>but I don't want him
to get so sick</i>

05:11.278 --> 05:13.812
to the point
where we can't fix it.

05:13.814 --> 05:17.683
[Sara] Do we want to carry him
over asleep and then we'll reverse him.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.217
- Is it open?
- [Alisha] Yeah, open.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.222
Oh, he's holding my hand.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.659
Oh, more comfortable.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.094
[Sara] That was adorable.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.429
Thank you, guys, very much.

05:40.973 --> 05:42.207
[visitor 3] Pretty.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.042
[visitor 4]
There's a lot of them.

05:49.982 --> 05:53.685
[whistling]

05:53.687 --> 05:56.054
[Casey] Come on, guys.
Come on.

05:57.757 --> 06:00.325
What we're feeding today
are little pinkies,

06:00.327 --> 06:01.760
little mice that we filled
with calcium.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.862
Any birds with big legs
when they're young

06:03.864 --> 06:06.098
and they're growing,
we always give extra calcium,

06:06.100 --> 06:07.966
AB pellet and then, for treats,

06:07.968 --> 06:09.134
live crickets.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.804
There we go, guys.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.573
The mom is actually trying
to feed the baby,

06:14.575 --> 06:15.440
a cricket right now.

06:16.843 --> 06:17.909
<i>Cora is our white-naped
crane chick</i>

06:17.911 --> 06:19.444
that hatched this year.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.346
She's only about two
to three months old right now.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.715
[woman 6] Oh, he's so cute.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.017
<i>[Casey] When she first hatched,
she was a couple hundred grams.</i>

06:26.019 --> 06:28.820
<i>She was a tiny little bird,</i>

06:28.822 --> 06:30.188
<i>and now she's already shut up,</i>

06:30.256 --> 06:32.157
<i>she's almost as close to being
the same size of her parents,</i>

06:32.159 --> 06:34.326
that get about
four and a half feet tall.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.794
She has a great appetite,

06:35.796 --> 06:38.897
we've gone from five days of
feeding when she was first hatched,

06:38.899 --> 06:41.233
to now she's only on one day
of treat feeding,

06:41.235 --> 06:43.335
and she's just a great bird.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.571
There we go, guys.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.741
White-naped cranes are found
anywhere from Southern Russia,

06:49.743 --> 06:51.443
<i>all the way down to South Korea.</i>

06:53.713 --> 06:55.514
<i>Most their population
lives in China.</i>

06:55.516 --> 06:58.216
<i>They are protected,
you can't hunt them.</i>

06:59.786 --> 07:02.487
Cora seems to be getting a lot more
comfortable with us and our keepers

07:02.489 --> 07:03.755
when we feed them.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.957
Right now, they're only
about 10, 15 feet away.

07:05.959 --> 07:06.892
When she first hatched,

07:06.894 --> 07:08.693
she would come pretty close
to the keepers.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.729
But then she learned
to be a little more weary.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.631
We started to catching her up
for vet rounds.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.367
Now she's nice, calm,
just watching us.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.703
I'm incredibly happy
with how well she's done.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.373
This is my first crane chick
to ever be a part of raising.

07:22.742 --> 07:24.643
<i>It's amazing to be able
to work with a species</i>

07:24.645 --> 07:25.877
<i>that's this important.</i>

07:25.879 --> 07:27.679
<i>There's only about
5,000 left in the wild,</i>

07:27.681 --> 07:29.548
so every time
that we can raise one,

07:29.550 --> 07:31.583
it's incredibly important
for the species.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.653
<i>And that is just rewarding
to watch it go from that egg</i>

07:34.655 --> 07:36.087
<i>and then seeing it hatch one day</i>

07:36.089 --> 07:38.790
<i>and just work the steps up
to eventually get the bird</i>

07:38.792 --> 07:39.791
<i>ready to be introduced</i>

07:39.793 --> 07:41.426
<i>with its own mate in the future.</i>

07:42.829 --> 07:46.932
She has one more round
of West Nile virus vaccine

07:46.934 --> 07:48.800
to prevent her
from getting the disease.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.436
But Cora is in with two
very protective parents,

07:51.438 --> 07:52.471
so we go in there.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.939
We're going to have to be
very careful

07:53.941 --> 07:55.874
to make sure we separate
the parents from the chick,

07:55.876 --> 07:57.642
and then once having the chick,

07:57.644 --> 07:59.978
<i>we're going to have to really
pay attention to see</i>

07:59.980 --> 08:01.413
<i>if they try to get
their chick back.</i>

08:07.820 --> 08:09.387
[girl] Giraffe!

08:15.228 --> 08:18.330
[Joseph] Right now, we're
in our off exhibit giraffe yard.

08:18.965 --> 08:20.732
This is honey locust,

08:20.734 --> 08:22.901
it's the closest thing
we have in New York

08:22.903 --> 08:26.104
to their native acacia,
from their range land.

08:29.609 --> 08:31.243
[Coleen] Let's get started.

08:31.978 --> 08:36.147
[Jospeh] <i>Jigsaw is our
4-year-old male giraffe.</i>

08:37.850 --> 08:41.186
<i>He has a very kind of
cautious but curious personality.</i>

08:42.922 --> 08:44.789
<i>Jigsaw was brought here</i>

08:44.791 --> 08:46.458
<i>so he could breed
with our female.</i>

08:47.660 --> 08:49.628
- Good to let her out?
- [Coleen] Yeah.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.429
[Jospeh]
Okay, you can go ahead, Cassy.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.832
[Cassy]
<i>Copy, opening the door.</i>

08:53.834 --> 08:56.134
<i>[Joseph] Zee Zee
is our 13-year-old female.</i>

08:56.136 --> 08:57.435
Hey, Zee Zee.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.838
<i>- [Coleen] She's coming out.
- [Cassy] She's walking out.</i>

08:59.840 --> 09:01.873
<i>[Joseph] She came from
the San Diego Safari Park,</i>

09:01.875 --> 09:04.943
<i>she's been here
almost 10 years now.</i>

09:04.945 --> 09:07.345
She's had two calves born
here over the years.

09:09.081 --> 09:10.649
[Coleen]
There's food, alright.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.783
Today is an important day,

09:11.785 --> 09:14.653
it's the first time that
Jigsaw is meeting Zee Zee.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.589
<i>This is the first time that they're
physically going to be in the same space.</i>

09:17.591 --> 09:21.126
There's usually some sort
of barrier between them.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.962
[Coleen] She's going to hold it while
she's grabbing the leaves off of it.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.397
That looks so funny.

09:26.532 --> 09:27.899
<i>[Joseph] Jigsaw
is still a young male.</i>

09:27.901 --> 09:29.968
<i>They can start breeding
between three and five,</i>

09:29.970 --> 09:33.004
<i>so we brought him
last fall with Abigail,</i>

09:33.006 --> 09:34.739
so it's his first time
being with a female.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.541
So it took a little bit
of stumbling around

09:36.543 --> 09:37.976
to kind of figure out
what to do.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.345
<i>But he did some successful
breeding with her.</i>

09:44.183 --> 09:45.717
[Coleen] Alright.
Oh, there it goes.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.586
There it goes.

09:47.588 --> 09:51.022
We're hoping that things maybe
move a little faster than it did last fall.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.891
[Coleen] Are you comfortable
letting him out now?

09:52.893 --> 09:54.426
Yeah, I think it's good.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.996
With almost all
of our animal introductions,

09:57.998 --> 10:00.765
we try to do them
in their holding enclosures,

10:00.767 --> 10:04.502
so that we can really assess
what's happening

10:04.504 --> 10:08.173
and in case it doesn't go
the way we had hoped for

10:08.175 --> 10:10.709
and it gets aggressive
or someone seems stressed,

10:10.711 --> 10:12.077
that we can intervene.

10:12.079 --> 10:15.080
[Jospeh] Good boy.
Look, it's easy.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.055
[Coleen]
She's not even looking.

10:24.057 --> 10:24.689
[Cassy] Nope.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.891
[laughing]

10:26.893 --> 10:28.593
[Coleen] And he's going
right to the brows too,

10:28.595 --> 10:29.961
so that's great.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.930
[Cassy] Paying no attention
to the other animal.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.966
- [Coleen] She's not even turning around.
- [Cassy] Nope. Hello?

10:34.968 --> 10:37.602
<i>[Joseph] Giraffes
are vulnerable in the wild.</i>

10:37.604 --> 10:39.604
There's about
a hundred thousand giraffes,

10:39.606 --> 10:40.839
<i>it's estimated to be right now,</i>

10:40.841 --> 10:42.874
<i>but their population
has gone down</i>

10:42.876 --> 10:45.143
<i>about 40% in the last 30 years.</i>

10:45.878 --> 10:47.545
<i>Not every zoo breeds giraffes,</i>

10:47.547 --> 10:49.581
<i>so we're large enough
and have enough space</i>

10:49.583 --> 10:52.584
that we can breed giraffes
and have a good sizable herd,

10:52.586 --> 10:54.719
<i>so that we're able
to basically help to hold</i>

10:54.721 --> 10:56.388
<i>giraffe population
in North America.</i>

10:57.690 --> 11:01.092
[Coleen] There's the start.
A little smelling.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.695
Just kind of what I expected.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.965
They'll come up slowly,
like giraffe do.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.134
And just start smelling
each other.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.837
Just the scent first.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.807
<i>[Joseph] Jigsaw,
he's never been with Zee Zee.</i>

11:15.809 --> 11:17.842
<i>But I think this will be
a good match.</i>

11:17.844 --> 11:18.943
Zee Zee's had two calves before,

11:18.945 --> 11:19.911
she's a really good mom.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.846
<i>So she sort of knows what to do.</i>

11:21.848 --> 11:24.315
<i>I think they'll be
a good union in the end.</i>

11:26.419 --> 11:28.820
- [Cassy] The nosy neighbors.
- [Coleen] Yeah, they're like,

11:28.822 --> 11:31.189
"hey, what's going
on over there?"

11:32.758 --> 11:33.958
<i>[Joseph] With this,
we have to gage</i>

11:33.960 --> 11:35.894
<i>what Zee Zee's estrous cycle is.</i>

11:35.896 --> 11:37.529
<i>They can come into heat
every two weeks,</i>

11:37.531 --> 11:38.963
and it's just
a little limited window,

11:38.965 --> 11:42.067
about a day or so, where
they'll actually be receptive.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.735
<i>Once he starts trying
to breed her,</i>

11:43.737 --> 11:45.036
<i>we can sort of pin plan,</i>

11:45.038 --> 11:48.173
<i>"okay, you know, like this
day she's probably in heat."</i>

11:48.175 --> 11:50.909
So we can kind of mark
that for the future

11:50.911 --> 11:53.011
and, like, "okay, in two weeks
from this date,

11:53.013 --> 11:54.979
we should try
put them together."

11:55.781 --> 11:56.781
[Coleen] Oh, there he goes.

11:56.783 --> 11:57.849
That was nice.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.051
[Cassy] I think her patience
is also starting to win.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.120
[Coleen] Yeah,
I was going to say.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.891
- Hey, Brandon?
- [Brandon] Yeah?

12:06.893 --> 12:09.260
[Coleen] If you think he'll
go into indoor, that's fine.

12:09.595 --> 12:10.395
<i>[Jeff] 10-4.</i>

12:13.032 --> 12:14.899
[Coleen] The set
went as we expected.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.836
She was in control,
which is exactly what we want.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.437
So, it was perfect.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.805
Good time to end,

12:20.807 --> 12:23.875
and we'll resume this
as often as possible.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.009
[Cassy] She got her.

12:25.444 --> 12:26.644
Well done, Joe.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.047
<i>[Brandon] Nicely done,
that's great.</i>

12:30.282 --> 12:33.818
[man 3] The goal is to get it
in this back corner right there.

12:33.820 --> 12:34.953
[Kevin] Go!

12:35.721 --> 12:36.988
That didn't work.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.758
[Jeff] He's coming out.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.826
[Brandon] 10-4, we're letting
Jigsaw out now.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.061
There's nothing we can really do

12:43.063 --> 12:44.763
to influence
how they're behaving.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.364
It's up for them
to do their job.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.375
- [girl 2] Ostrich!
- [visitor 4] Yeah.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.115
[Casey] Feel comfortable with the
short one, or you want a long one?

13:05.785 --> 13:09.387
[Chuck] The goal is to get it
in this back corner right there.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.056
[Dr. Drumm] Oh, he is big.

13:13.692 --> 13:15.593
[Casey] Just be ready
to pull back

13:15.595 --> 13:18.429
- if they come bucking toward this way.
- [Kevin] Alright, okay.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.597
<i>[Casey] We're here with our vets</i>

13:19.599 --> 13:21.766
<i>to catch up
our white-naped crane chick,</i>

13:21.768 --> 13:24.102
<i>get a weight on her,
give her an overall physical</i>

13:24.104 --> 13:27.105
and then give her her final
West Nile virus vaccine.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.842
[Dr. Drumm]
He's beginning...

13:30.844 --> 13:33.044
[Casey] The parents
are pretty protective.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.046
That's such cool birds.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.383
Okay, Kevin, I may need you
to block for me.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.152
[Kevin] Go!

13:42.254 --> 13:43.388
That didn't work.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.091
The parents are very defensive,

13:47.093 --> 13:48.827
and so when we're in there,

13:48.829 --> 13:50.662
somebody has got
to pay attention

13:50.664 --> 13:52.430
to mom and dad,
because they'll come over

13:52.432 --> 13:53.565
and give you a whack or two

13:53.567 --> 13:55.400
if you're not paying attention.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.169
[Chuck] I'm going to get it, but I
need someone to look the parents.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.972
- [Casey] That's what we want.
- [Kevin] That's fine.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.006
There you go.

14:02.441 --> 14:03.341
Alright.

14:05.144 --> 14:06.244
[Casey] Got it, boss?

14:07.613 --> 14:08.546
[Kevin] Alright.

14:14.453 --> 14:15.820
<i>[Casey] We' have
vet exams on cranes,</i>

14:15.822 --> 14:18.022
<i>we always have
two staff available.</i>

14:18.024 --> 14:20.825
We need to look the legs,
feet, mouth, wings.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.760
It's a lot easier
to handle the birds

14:22.762 --> 14:24.829
with two extra sets of hands.

14:24.831 --> 14:27.165
[Dr. Drumm] So, I'm going
to start with the vaccine.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.235
[Kevin] I know, I know.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.003
You, guys, are big and mean.

14:32.005 --> 14:32.403
[laughing]

14:32.405 --> 14:34.572
[Casey] Okay.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.275
[Dr. Drumm] I'm just going to look at
the ear really quick. I know, baba, I know.

14:38.844 --> 14:40.879
Looks very nice.
The nose looks clear.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.981
The mouth looks good.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.817
<i>On exam, she was
very bright alert.</i>

14:45.819 --> 14:47.051
Beautiful.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.853
<i>Her feet looked really good.</i>

14:48.855 --> 14:52.190
I didn't see any swelling
or any concerns with her legs.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.692
It's good. Alright.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.695
<i>I didn't feel any concerns
on my quick health vision</i>

14:57.697 --> 14:59.898
<i>and I didn't hear any concerns</i>

14:59.900 --> 15:02.033
<i>when I listened to her heart
or her lungs.</i>

15:02.234 --> 15:03.334
[Casey] Ready?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.009
It went nice.

15:12.211 --> 15:13.444
Parents are happy.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.979
Chick's back with them.

15:15.447 --> 15:16.981
Good weight,
good body condition,

15:16.983 --> 15:18.449
so we're happy for the day.

15:20.886 --> 15:22.787
<i>Cora is looking amazing.</i>

15:22.789 --> 15:25.089
The vet gave her a 100% okay.

15:25.691 --> 15:26.624
<i>Pretty soon will be moving Cora</i>

15:26.626 --> 15:28.092
<i>to her own separate holding.</i>

15:28.094 --> 15:30.662
<i>We need Cora to be used to
being away from her parents</i>

15:30.664 --> 15:32.830
<i>before she'll be moved
to her next zoo.</i>

15:32.832 --> 15:33.731
<i>And that just gives her parents</i>

15:33.733 --> 15:35.433
<i>time to start building
new nesting,</i>

15:35.435 --> 15:37.402
<i>get ready for the breeding
season next year.</i>

15:41.040 --> 15:47.011
[music playing]

15:53.686 --> 15:55.119
[Dr. Drumm] Hi, handsome man.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.790
<i>Kip has a couple of problems.</i>

15:58.792 --> 16:00.558
What we suspect
is the primary problem

16:00.560 --> 16:01.626
is this diarrhea

16:01.628 --> 16:04.162
and that he just became
very dehydrated.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.631
- [woman] Do you want-- - I'll
just move the back of the leg.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.032
[woman] You can face him.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.635
<i>[Dr. Drumm] And so, to help
support him through this,</i>

16:10.637 --> 16:13.004
we have moved him
to our incubator,

16:13.006 --> 16:15.974
<i>where he can get oxygen
and heat support all the time.</i>

16:15.976 --> 16:17.909
It's cold, just a little cold.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.777
<i>Because he's so young,</i>

16:19.779 --> 16:22.914
he still is trusting of us.

16:22.916 --> 16:26.017
We're able to do awake
procedures with him.

16:26.852 --> 16:28.052
So brave!

16:28.687 --> 16:31.456
[woman] He is so good at this.
I don't know how calm he is,

16:31.458 --> 16:32.757
he's always so good with that.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.859
[Dr. Drumm] I would love
to just take a listen to him

16:34.861 --> 16:37.028
and then get
a temperature on him.

16:39.064 --> 16:42.133
I don't hear any crackles
or any harsh lung sounds.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.434
So that's good.

16:44.970 --> 16:47.805
Oh my gosh, 100.1.

16:47.807 --> 16:48.873
Look at you.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.141
[woman] Alright.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.809
<i>[Dr. Drumm] Kip's body
temperature is normal</i>

16:51.811 --> 16:52.910
for a young langur.

16:52.912 --> 16:56.214
I think of them as of kind
of like a warm human,

16:56.216 --> 16:58.850
so they tend to run just
a little bit warmer than us.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.885
So, 99, 100, 101,

17:00.887 --> 17:03.287
those are all
normal temperatures for them.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.058
Alright, I think
you're ready to move.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.593
<i>Every day,
we're making improvement</i>

17:08.595 --> 17:09.994
<i>in the right direction.</i>

17:09.996 --> 17:11.929
<i>He's been breathing really well,</i>

17:11.931 --> 17:13.931
<i>his energy has been improving.</i>

17:13.933 --> 17:15.566
<i>So, we're actually moving him</i>

17:15.568 --> 17:17.835
<i>from our incubator
to an enclosure,</i>

17:17.837 --> 17:19.537
<i>it's just another area
in the hospital.</i>

17:19.539 --> 17:22.006
We need to put
some water in here for him.

17:22.008 --> 17:25.376
- [woman] He's got the bottle.
- [Dr. Drumm] It's better his bottle. Okay.

17:29.348 --> 17:32.483
[woman]
His glucose is still low.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.720
[Dr. Drumm] Clinically, he looks
pretty good, right? And he's eating,

17:35.722 --> 17:38.956
and it would be nice to recheck
tomorrow. We'll just baby steps.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.491
<i>[woman] Alright, we will see
how it does today,</i>

17:40.493 --> 17:42.360
<i>we'll have keepers up.</i>

17:42.362 --> 17:45.530
- [Dr. Drumm] Perfect. Awesome.
- [woman] For them to keep him eating and hydrated.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.499
[Dr. Drumm] Every step in the right
direction is a step closer to home.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.768
<i>And if we can just
support him through this,</i>

17:50.770 --> 17:53.071
<i>there's a good chance
that he will go back</i>

17:53.073 --> 17:54.939
<i>to live a happy,
normal langur life.</i>

17:55.006 --> 17:56.307
Awesome.

17:58.544 --> 18:00.912
<i>[Ruth] Big Man
likes to play with toys.</i>

18:00.914 --> 18:03.981
<i>The most important thing,
though, I think it's the attention</i>

18:03.983 --> 18:04.849
<i>more than any toy.</i>

18:04.851 --> 18:08.419
Yes, my love. I love you.

18:15.461 --> 18:18.362
[boy] I see three, and each
of them have only one hump.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.999
[Ruth] You been waiting
to play with something?

18:22.901 --> 18:24.001
Go get it.

18:25.571 --> 18:26.938
[Ruth laughs]

18:26.940 --> 18:29.273
His ears go back
and he sort of charges at it.

18:32.044 --> 18:36.147
This is the camel's feed room
at the camel barn.

18:36.648 --> 18:39.650
<i>We have our grains, feed bowls,</i>

18:39.652 --> 18:43.421
and a lot of space is used
for this little donkey's toys.

18:45.891 --> 18:49.160
We have a micro-mini donkey,
his name is Big Man.

18:49.561 --> 18:51.796
<i>He likes to play with toys.</i>

18:51.798 --> 18:54.932
<i>And he needs a variety,
so that he doesn't get bored.</i>

18:55.167 --> 18:57.435
Some of them are just homemade,

18:57.437 --> 18:59.737
and some are intended
to be used putting,

18:59.739 --> 19:01.639
<i>like, little treats in them.</i>

19:01.641 --> 19:04.876
He's a little bachelor,
but he's not really alone

19:04.878 --> 19:06.777
<i>because all day long
he's walking around,</i>

19:06.779 --> 19:08.146
<i>interacting with the camels</i>

19:08.148 --> 19:10.214
<i>and interacting with all of us.</i>

19:11.049 --> 19:12.383
<i>Good morning.</i>

19:12.951 --> 19:16.020
Hi, baby. You ready?

19:17.489 --> 19:19.056
I'm going to do your feet.

19:21.426 --> 19:24.428
Just picking out anything
that's stuck in his hoof.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.863
It's leathery, it's not...

19:25.865 --> 19:28.299
Doesn't hurt on
when you pick around it.

19:30.969 --> 19:33.871
I started in the camel barn
when I was young,

19:33.873 --> 19:35.106
I was 15 years old.

19:35.874 --> 19:36.908
<i>As a summer job,</i>

19:36.975 --> 19:40.144
and the qualifications
were that I loved animals.

19:40.146 --> 19:42.847
<i>I started out to work
in pony rides,</i>

19:42.849 --> 19:45.016
<i>and then walking camels.</i>

19:45.884 --> 19:46.717
<i>But Big Man...</i>

19:46.719 --> 19:47.985
What a good kid.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.988
<i>He's just so good to be around.</i>

19:50.990 --> 19:53.958
So, I'm going to try
and make a toy

19:53.960 --> 19:57.028
for Big Man that resembles a toy

19:57.030 --> 19:58.696
that he was very fond of.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.132
But he goes
through them too fast.

20:01.134 --> 20:04.001
I mean, he's very destructive,
playful.

20:06.171 --> 20:08.039
So, we have to come up
with something

20:08.073 --> 20:10.141
to make him happy.

20:10.776 --> 20:11.943
This has fabric that he can get

20:11.945 --> 20:14.912
his teeth into
and pull it around.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.881
I think it's just
something new. He likes...

20:16.883 --> 20:18.382
He likes new things.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.718
It's just like with children,

20:20.720 --> 20:22.887
sometimes they enjoy
the packaging

20:22.889 --> 20:23.821
more than the gift.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.792
Just as it's important
for children to play

20:27.794 --> 20:30.695
and to constantly be challenged,

20:30.697 --> 20:32.163
<i>it's the same thing for animals,</i>

20:32.165 --> 20:33.998
<i>they need that stimulation
in their lives</i>

20:34.000 --> 20:35.433
<i>and their environments.</i>

20:35.435 --> 20:36.901
And if he doesn't get it
naturally,

20:36.903 --> 20:40.171
then it's very important for
us to bring it into his world.

20:40.173 --> 20:43.140
Hey, buddy.
Would you like a toy?

20:43.909 --> 20:45.209
Let's see if you like it.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.378
Ready? Go get it!

20:48.880 --> 20:50.081
Hey, buddy.

20:50.616 --> 20:53.651
What is this? What is it?

20:53.653 --> 20:54.885
When he's playing,
he rips it up,

20:54.887 --> 20:58.222
he just gets out of control.

20:58.724 --> 21:01.459
<i>You know, he's balancing toys
off the walls</i>

21:01.461 --> 21:04.262
<i>and running around in
circles, and it's quite adorable.</i>

21:04.997 --> 21:07.131
I'll give you a treat toy later.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.199
Go run around a little.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.367
Go ahead.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.802
You want to come out?

21:11.804 --> 21:13.938
So, Big Man,
he has everybody charmed.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.406
You know, he really does.

21:15.408 --> 21:18.142
Oh, what a good boy. So good.

21:18.144 --> 21:22.113
He has qualities of a horse
that people love, and a dog.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.048
[man] Now, roll over.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.083
You ready?

21:26.085 --> 21:28.953
<i>[Ruth] Once in a while,
we'll bring him out on the road</i>

21:28.955 --> 21:31.255
and have a little jog
with the keepers.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.991
Wow, racehorse.

21:34.660 --> 21:35.693
Wow!

21:36.695 --> 21:38.863
<i>The most important thing
for him, though,</i>

21:38.865 --> 21:41.866
<i>I think it's the attention
and affection,</i>

21:41.868 --> 21:43.134
<i>more than any toy.</i>

21:43.136 --> 21:44.402
Yes, my love.

21:45.871 --> 21:46.971
You had fun?

21:47.973 --> 21:49.073
Did you?

21:49.075 --> 21:50.341
You had a good time?

21:52.944 --> 21:53.978
[visitor] Wow, guys.

21:54.446 --> 21:57.381
A giraffe baby is already
six feet tall at birth.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.083
[visitor 2] Look it.

21:59.085 --> 21:59.917
Look it, it's the giraffe.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.686
[visitor] How awesome.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.021
[Brandon] Today, Zee Zee
is going to come out at four,

22:04.023 --> 22:06.524
and then Jigsaw will be coming
out of here, right?

22:06.526 --> 22:08.926
- Out of the shoot?
- [Cassy] Yes.

22:08.928 --> 22:12.430
[Brandon] And then-And, Jeff, how do you stay
down at the far end as well. Sounds good?

22:12.432 --> 22:13.364
[Jeff] sounds good.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.235
Going to let Zee Zee out now.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.104
<i>[Brandon] Yeah, Jeff.
You can go ahead.</i>

22:20.106 --> 22:21.205
Copy that.

22:26.945 --> 22:29.146
[Jeff] She's coming out.

22:29.148 --> 22:31.716
[Brandon] 10-4.
We're letting Jigsaw out now.

22:31.718 --> 22:32.983
<i>[Jeff] Copy that.</i>

22:33.585 --> 22:35.186
[Cassy] Let's see your lady.

22:38.123 --> 22:40.891
<i>[Brandon] We've been doing
breeding introductions</i>

22:40.893 --> 22:41.926
for about a month now.

22:41.928 --> 22:44.962
It's trying to just determine
when she's cycling

22:44.964 --> 22:46.130
and when she's in estrous.

22:46.732 --> 22:47.865
There's nothing we can really do

22:47.867 --> 22:50.434
to influence
how they're behaving.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.436
We're just here to make sure
that, you know,

22:52.438 --> 22:54.839
things do get to a point where
we need to separate them,

22:54.841 --> 22:57.708
that we can step in
and help in that process.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.642
But, for the most part,

22:58.644 --> 23:01.979
it's up for them
to do their job.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.917
[Cassy] He's trying
to kind of stimulate her

23:06.919 --> 23:09.453
to see if she'll urinate
for him.

23:09.455 --> 23:12.590
And then, if she does
urinate for him,

23:12.592 --> 23:16.527
them she's probably going to--
There she goes.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.496
So, she's urinating,
and what he'll be doing,

23:18.498 --> 23:21.031
he'll stick out his tongue
like he's currently doing

23:21.033 --> 23:23.868
and he'll have it run
against the roof of his mouth.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.437
That's called
a Flehmen response,

23:26.439 --> 23:28.873
and that will actually
let him see

23:28.875 --> 23:30.241
if she's ready to breed or not.

23:31.810 --> 23:32.910
She does.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.912
[Brandon]
She definitely seems,

23:34.914 --> 23:38.015
I think to us, a little bit
more receptive, maybe.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.217
[Jeff] He's certainly not acting

23:40.219 --> 23:42.052
like she's in estrous, though.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.421
[Brandon] No.

23:43.488 --> 23:47.324
I mean, not even really
following her that closely.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.928
- Cassy, we're going to go ahead and split them.
- [Cassy] Okay.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.763
[Brandon]
And end on a positive note.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.598
Why don't you go down
there with him?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.867
- [Cassy] Okay.
- [Brandon] And just help with that door.

23:56.869 --> 24:00.371
Obviously want to avoid having them
in there together. So it's easier to open.

24:00.373 --> 24:03.274
- See what you can do.
- [Cassy] You got it.

24:03.276 --> 24:06.410
[Brandon] We definitely have
to put them together tomorrow.

24:06.412 --> 24:07.845
[Jeff] Yeah.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.080
- [Cassy] Ready, Brandon?
- [Brandon] Yeah. Go ahead.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.388
He's coming down that way too.

24:18.957 --> 24:19.957
<i>[Cassy] Copy.</i>

24:25.931 --> 24:27.832
<i>Even though we didn't see
any breeding,</i>

24:27.834 --> 24:28.799
<i>it went really well.</i>

24:28.801 --> 24:30.434
<i>It kind of let us know</i>

24:30.436 --> 24:32.603
<i>where we're getting
kind of closer to the window.</i>

24:32.605 --> 24:33.804
<i>So, as long as we
stay consistent,</i>

24:33.806 --> 24:35.573
<i>we can get that perfect timing</i>

24:35.575 --> 24:38.008
<i>of whenever Zee Zee
is actually ready to breed.</i>

24:38.010 --> 24:40.845
<i>So, what's next is that we'll
continue to introduce them</i>

24:40.847 --> 24:43.981
and hopefully we see
a successful copulation.

24:46.751 --> 24:49.086
<i>[Casey] We want to get
separated from the parents</i>

24:49.088 --> 24:49.720
prior to the shipment.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.956
Go for it.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.425
[Dr. Drumm] It's scary moving to
your own apartment for the first time.

24:54.427 --> 24:56.460
- [Casey] Pre event, though.
- [Dr. Drumm] True.

25:09.107 --> 25:10.307
[Juliet] Hi, Jess.

25:10.809 --> 25:13.410
I'm making this for Kip.

25:13.412 --> 25:15.813
I'm gathering
some cooked zucchini

25:15.815 --> 25:17.915
because it's got
a nice high-water content,

25:17.917 --> 25:19.617
some assorted nuts.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.585
I'm going to cut up
some plantain.

25:21.587 --> 25:25.422
Currently plantain is
his most desirable food item.

25:26.925 --> 25:28.959
<i>His appetite
has been really good.</i>

25:28.961 --> 25:30.995
He's almost double fisting it.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.297
He's like pregaming
his next snack.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.199
Hi, Kip.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.167
Hi, doll.

25:37.936 --> 25:40.704
You're watching Fraggle Rock?

25:40.706 --> 25:43.374
<i>He's usually got a lot of
action and activity around him,</i>

25:43.376 --> 25:45.109
so it's like white noise,

25:45.111 --> 25:49.046
and it's just another thing
to help him be comfortable.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.015
I love you.

25:51.249 --> 25:52.283
Kip.

25:56.021 --> 25:56.720
Come on.

25:56.788 --> 25:59.290
Good boy.

25:59.292 --> 26:03.127
<i>Kip's health has definitely
improved since his procedure.</i>

26:03.129 --> 26:04.595
Want a snack
for your other hand?

26:04.597 --> 26:06.830
<i>His mentation is really good,</i>

26:06.832 --> 26:09.934
<i>his activity level
is where it should be.</i>

26:09.936 --> 26:11.001
<i>And his appetite...</i>

26:11.003 --> 26:11.869
Good boy.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.671
<i>is perfect.</i>

26:13.673 --> 26:16.440
He's eating everything
that we give him.

26:17.108 --> 26:19.009
Come get a treat,
which one you want?

26:19.011 --> 26:20.311
Zucchini or plantain?

26:20.845 --> 26:22.913
Plantain!

26:22.915 --> 26:24.114
Can I groom you, Kip?

26:24.116 --> 26:25.716
Oh, good boy.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.017
Langurs are social animals,

26:27.019 --> 26:28.719
and they participate in grooming

26:28.721 --> 26:31.889
which it solidifies
social bonds.

26:31.891 --> 26:34.959
So, this hopefully
soothes him to some degree.

26:36.728 --> 26:37.962
Good job.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.797
So, there's the double
fisting action

26:39.799 --> 26:41.098
I was talking about.

26:41.100 --> 26:45.970
<i>This is a great Litmus test
for future medication needs.</i>

26:45.972 --> 26:48.339
You want them
getting comfortable,

26:48.341 --> 26:50.140
coming to you and taking treats

26:50.142 --> 26:51.475
and taking them readily.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.410
Good job!

26:53.412 --> 26:55.746
<i>At this age,
it's very imperative</i>

26:55.748 --> 26:58.716
<i>that young langurs
remain with the group.</i>

26:58.718 --> 27:00.784
This is an important time
in his life

27:00.786 --> 27:03.454
where he's learning
social dynamics

27:03.456 --> 27:06.824
and he learns that
from his mother and siblings.

27:06.826 --> 27:09.460
<i>Hopefully,
this trend will continue</i>

27:09.462 --> 27:12.997
<i>and he'll be on the road
to being discharged.</i>

27:12.999 --> 27:15.332
I'm being cautiously optimistic.

27:17.102 --> 27:18.068
Good job.

27:19.671 --> 27:25.442
[music playing]

27:29.447 --> 27:32.416
<i>[Jim] some of my favorite
times to go around the zoo</i>

27:32.418 --> 27:34.151
<i>are the early morning hours
like these,</i>

27:34.153 --> 27:37.287
<i>before people come in,
and there's a lot of activity.</i>

27:38.023 --> 27:39.089
Hey, guys.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.258
How are you?

27:41.693 --> 27:42.826
<i>When you look at the cranes,</i>

27:42.894 --> 27:45.963
<i>I think you have to be
impressed by their elegance.</i>

27:45.965 --> 27:49.867
<i>It's important to show
this diversity of species</i>

27:49.869 --> 27:50.701
<i>throughout the zoo,</i>

27:50.703 --> 27:51.902
<i>because people
need to appreciate</i>

27:51.904 --> 27:54.571
<i>how wonderful and magical
nature is</i>

27:54.573 --> 27:56.974
<i>and realize why it's
important to save it.</i>

27:56.976 --> 27:59.843
<i>In the early days, zoos
were basically menageries,</i>

27:59.845 --> 28:02.146
<i>I mean, they just
displayed animals.</i>

28:02.148 --> 28:05.816
What we do now
is collectively work together

28:05.818 --> 28:08.752
to sustain species
into the future.

28:08.754 --> 28:12.389
<i>Most of these species have a
species survival plan program</i>

28:12.391 --> 28:14.958
that plans all the births
and does all the pairings

28:14.960 --> 28:17.961
to ensure that there's genetic
diversity for that species,

28:17.963 --> 28:19.630
<i>and that's exactly
what we're doing here</i>

28:19.632 --> 28:21.432
<i>with this white-naped
crane chick.</i>

28:24.502 --> 28:26.737
<i>[Chuck] Cora, the female
white-naped crane chick,</i>

28:26.739 --> 28:29.440
<i>it's time for her to be
separated from her parents.</i>

28:30.842 --> 28:32.843
<i>We got word
that she's recommended</i>

28:32.845 --> 28:35.813
to transfer to another
AZA zoo in Conneticut,

28:35.815 --> 28:37.448
the Beardsley Zoo.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.516
Where there's already
a male waiting for her.

28:39.518 --> 28:41.618
So, when she transfers there,
they'll be paired up

28:41.620 --> 28:44.455
<i>and, hopefully,
will breed in the future.</i>

28:44.457 --> 28:47.224
<i>So, we want to get her
separated from the parents</i>

28:47.226 --> 28:48.659
<i>prior to the shipment.</i>

28:48.661 --> 28:50.427
All right, we've got
more open room there,

28:50.429 --> 28:52.429
so I'm going to push
this way around.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.932
There comes a period
of time where parents

28:54.934 --> 28:57.701
might act aggressively
towards a juvenile

28:57.703 --> 28:59.670
that is still in their territory

28:59.672 --> 29:01.638
from the previous season.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.440
[Ken] You have a shot.
Take it.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.776
<i>[Chuck] So, we have
to separate young birds</i>

29:05.778 --> 29:08.178
from parents
for the chick's own good.

29:21.826 --> 29:23.093
It's fine. It's fine.

29:24.162 --> 29:25.195
Okay, I'm out.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.971
178.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.372
- [woman] 178?
- [Ken] Yep.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.207
On the left leg.

29:40.478 --> 29:43.680
We're banding her because,
as she gets older,

29:43.682 --> 29:45.883
the males and the females
look pretty much the same.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.718
So, when she gets shipped out

29:47.720 --> 29:48.685
to another institution,

29:48.687 --> 29:52.055
another zoo
for breeding purposes,

29:52.057 --> 29:54.358
it helps to have them banded,
you know who is who.

29:58.429 --> 29:59.363
[woman] Hey, baby.

29:59.864 --> 30:01.398
[Chuck] There, got it. Good.

30:02.433 --> 30:04.034
[Ken] See,
there's a number on it.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.035
So that's her individual number.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.571
It's 178.

30:07.573 --> 30:11.842
Cora is the perfect example
of how an SSP pairing works.

30:11.844 --> 30:14.645
<i>[Jim] We get birds
that are genetically valuable</i>

30:14.647 --> 30:17.881
<i>that we want their genes
passed on to next generation.</i>

30:17.883 --> 30:20.951
<i>We pair them,
they produce an offspring,</i>

30:20.953 --> 30:22.052
<i>and now that offspring,</i>

30:22.054 --> 30:23.787
<i>who has
all these valuable genes,</i>

30:23.789 --> 30:25.522
<i>goes to another institution</i>

30:25.524 --> 30:26.824
<i>to be paired
with a different bird</i>

30:26.826 --> 30:30.394
to pass those genes
on to succeeding generations.

30:32.931 --> 30:35.566
[Ken] We're on our way from
one side of the World of Birds,

30:35.568 --> 30:36.733
where there are crane yards,

30:36.735 --> 30:38.602
to the opposite side
of the World of Birds,

30:38.604 --> 30:40.704
where there's another set
of crane yards.

30:40.706 --> 30:43.607
And so, we're separating her
from her parents,

30:43.609 --> 30:46.109
and now here we also have
a black-neck crane,

30:46.845 --> 30:48.979
and an East African
crowned crane.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.380
And she'll be next to them.

30:50.915 --> 30:52.816
Okay, so.

30:52.818 --> 30:55.052
Alright, I'm going down
and release her in the back.

30:58.289 --> 30:59.923
Go for it.

30:59.925 --> 31:02.259
[Casey] We will watch
her go first. Watch her go.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.428
[Dr. Drumm]
It's always scary

31:04.430 --> 31:06.630
moving into your own apartment
for the first time.

31:06.632 --> 31:09.199
- [Casey] Pre event, though.
- [Dr. Drumm] That's true.

31:10.735 --> 31:13.003
<i>[Ken] Well,
that was nice and calm.</i>

31:18.776 --> 31:21.044
<i>That went great. I mean,
the release was phenomenal.</i>

31:21.046 --> 31:22.980
<i>Sometimes with the cranes,
when you release them,</i>

31:22.982 --> 31:23.947
they get into a run.

31:23.949 --> 31:25.849
Because it's stressful
and scary for them.

31:25.851 --> 31:27.551
<i>The team just walked away
very calmy.</i>

31:27.553 --> 31:29.753
<i>It's great.
That's what you want to see.</i>

31:29.755 --> 31:33.423
- [Dr. Drumm] That's awesome.
- [Casey] A job masterfully done, Ken.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.459
<i>[Chuck] She'll live here
for a little while,</i>

31:35.461 --> 31:39.196
<i>and then she'll be moving on to
the Beardsley Zoo in Connecticut</i>

31:39.198 --> 31:41.965
and meet the male that's
waiting for her there for breeding.

31:43.801 --> 31:46.036
<i>[Alisha] We are moving Kip
back from the health center</i>

31:46.038 --> 31:47.104
<i>to Jungle World today.</i>

31:47.106 --> 31:48.538
Hi, Kip. Hi!

31:48.540 --> 31:50.841
Hopefully, everybody gets along

31:50.843 --> 31:53.110
<i>and they're just
really happy to see him.</i>

32:12.697 --> 32:14.031
<i>[Cassy] Good morning, lady.</i>

32:14.033 --> 32:15.933
<i>[Joseph] You want that,
they're ready.</i>

32:15.935 --> 32:17.200
Hi, my friend Zee Zee.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.002
Come on up.

32:19.604 --> 32:20.938
[Cassy] Hi.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.040
- [Joseph] Good girl.
- [Cassy] What's up, baby?

32:24.976 --> 32:26.109
Girl.

32:26.511 --> 32:27.744
[Joseph] Good lady.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.813
Over the last several months,
we've been putting

32:29.815 --> 32:31.949
Zee Zee and Jigsaw together
for breeding.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.450
[Cassy] That was good. Foot.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.985
[Joseph]
<i>Even from the beginning,</i>

32:34.987 --> 32:37.187
<i>Jigsaw was definitely
interested in Zee Zee.</i>

32:37.789 --> 32:39.890
<i>With any introduction,</i>

32:39.892 --> 32:41.458
<i>it takes time for them
to get to know each other</i>

32:41.460 --> 32:42.926
<i>and to be comfortable
with each other.</i>

32:42.928 --> 32:44.594
You never really know
how each pair will be,

32:44.596 --> 32:46.797
sometimes they don't want
to breed at all.

32:46.799 --> 32:50.000
<i>Their personalities might not
match, just like with people.</i>

32:50.002 --> 32:52.336
<i>But eventually,
after several sessions,</i>

32:52.338 --> 32:55.272
they did seem to copulate
successfully.

32:56.808 --> 33:01.078
<i>He mated her once, for
about a second, two seconds.</i>

33:01.080 --> 33:04.147
<i>So, it's quick, but that's
all it usually takes</i>

33:04.149 --> 33:06.416
<i>for a successful breeding.</i>

33:06.418 --> 33:08.719
You can also see a change
in their behavior.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.121
Once they bred, they don't
usually try to do it again,

33:11.123 --> 33:14.124
<i>and if she is pregnant, they
won't continue to try to breed.</i>

33:14.859 --> 33:15.425
[Cassy] And foot.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.327
Good.

33:17.462 --> 33:20.998
<i>[Joseph] Recently, we got
confirmation that Jigsaw successfully bred</i>

33:21.000 --> 33:23.934
<i>and impregnated one of our
other female giraffes, Abigail.</i>

33:25.036 --> 33:27.037
<i>So, we're hoping he does
the same with Zee Zee.</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:31.475
<i>This is grain, sweeter
than what they normally get,</i>

33:31.477 --> 33:34.277
<i>so we use it for training as
like the higher value reward.</i>

33:34.279 --> 33:37.881
We're just training Zee Zee
for hoof block training,

33:37.883 --> 33:40.450
<i>she's a bit shy, so the more
time we spend with her, the better.</i>

33:40.985 --> 33:42.219
Good girl.

33:44.889 --> 33:46.823
<i>We like to give the animals
as many opportunities</i>

33:46.825 --> 33:49.426
<i>to display these natural
behaviors as possible,</i>

33:49.428 --> 33:52.029
and rearing offspring
is definitely one of them.

33:52.031 --> 33:53.830
[Cassy]
I've got a quarter left.

33:53.832 --> 33:54.564
[Joseph] I'm good.

33:54.566 --> 33:55.599
[Cassy] Okay.

33:55.601 --> 33:58.101
Alright, lady.
You want to back up for us?

33:59.404 --> 34:01.972
<i>[Joseph] Giraffes
have a long gestation.</i>

34:01.974 --> 34:05.042
<i>It takes about 14 to 15 months
for a giraffe fetus to develop.</i>

34:05.044 --> 34:06.910
<i>So we're waiting a while
to see Zee Zee</i>

34:06.912 --> 34:08.311
<i>becomes pregnant.</i>

34:10.014 --> 34:11.114
- Good lady.
- [Cassy] Good job, Zee Zee.

34:11.116 --> 34:12.382
[Joseph] Thank you.

34:12.917 --> 34:14.885
- [Cassy] Bye.
- [Jospeh] Bye.

34:14.887 --> 34:17.954
I'm hoping 15 months
or so from now

34:17.956 --> 34:20.023
that will have a new giraffe
calf on the ground.

34:20.425 --> 34:21.391
Yes!

34:28.499 --> 34:35.005
[music playing]

34:36.941 --> 34:39.209
[Jeff] I don't think
this has a backing camera on.

34:39.211 --> 34:40.944
[Ken] It's got stuck,
doesn't it?

34:41.011 --> 34:42.946
Good, good.

34:44.649 --> 34:47.818
You got the nets.
So rock and roll.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.953
- Thank you.
- [Casey] Eeny, meeny, miny... Mo.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.421
[Casey] Today is a big day.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.156
We're moving
our white-naped crane chick

34:53.158 --> 34:55.392
from this year
to the Beardsley Zoo

34:56.727 --> 34:57.828
<i>Whenever we get to move</i>

34:57.830 --> 34:59.963
<i>a young, genetically
important bird,</i>

34:59.965 --> 35:01.398
<i>it's always a great feeling.</i>

35:08.873 --> 35:10.474
[Jeff] Alright, there it goes.

35:13.478 --> 35:16.012
[Casey] Easy, see.
You, look, go ahead last.

35:16.014 --> 35:18.381
[Ken] Keep the head from you.
Yes, I've got the head.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.117
Close the door.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.786
[Casey] Nice and smooth.

35:22.788 --> 35:25.522
Bird in the crate,
nobody hurt, no bird hurt.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.589
That's all good.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.758
<i>Whenever we have
a crate with these guys,</i>

35:28.760 --> 35:30.694
we make sure we have the
right crate for the right bird.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.062
It's going in the middle.

35:32.064 --> 35:34.564
<i>We make sure there's a nice,
firm pad on the bottom.</i>

35:34.566 --> 35:36.700
<i>When you're in it drive, you
make sure the top is padded</i>

35:36.702 --> 35:37.934
<i>so they don't hit their heads.</i>

35:37.936 --> 35:40.270
We make sure it's
a little bit darker in there

35:40.272 --> 35:41.805
so they can relax
a little bit more.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.741
<i>They're not seeing a lot of things
that are happening around them.</i>

35:44.743 --> 35:46.109
[Jeff] Alright. You driving?

35:46.111 --> 35:47.310
[Casey] I'm driving.

35:50.681 --> 35:51.781
It's about an hour drive,

35:51.783 --> 35:53.517
we always have to keep
in mind the bird,

35:53.519 --> 35:57.020
we're going to listen to her. She
has never been in a crate before.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.991
Typically, the zoos
are in the same region.

36:00.993 --> 36:03.527
We're really close together,
so the Beardsley Zoo

36:03.529 --> 36:05.529
<i>is not far away
from us in Connecticut.</i>

36:05.531 --> 36:07.697
<i>[Jim] We both work
with white-naped cranes,</i>

36:07.699 --> 36:09.232
<i>so that makes them
a perfect partner.</i>

36:09.800 --> 36:11.067
[girl] Oh, right there!

36:13.037 --> 36:14.104
[visitor] It's beautiful.

36:21.145 --> 36:22.979
- [Jeff] Good morning.
- [Casey] Good morning.

36:22.981 --> 36:23.747
[Bethany] Hi.

36:23.749 --> 36:24.981
This is Mc Jeffie.

36:24.983 --> 36:27.150
He's one of our
older residents here,

36:27.152 --> 36:29.152
we only had him
for about two years.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.621
[man] He is 38.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.823
He is three months older
than I am.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.759
[Casey] Did you ever have
a mate for this one?

36:35.761 --> 36:37.694
[man] No, we just recently
got it to the program.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.630
[Casey] Okay. It's always
exciting to pair up cranes.

36:40.632 --> 36:43.300
- [man 2] Okay. Are we good?
- [Casey] Yeah, we're ready to go.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.802
- Alright. You okay?
- [Jeff] Yep.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.672
<i>[Bethany] Cora will probably be
in quarantine for at least 30 days.</i>

36:48.674 --> 36:50.240
<i>We like to keep
our animals separated,</i>

36:50.242 --> 36:51.774
<i>even though she came
from the Bronx Zoo,</i>

36:51.776 --> 36:54.744
<i>where they take good care of
their animals, we want to make sure</i>

36:54.746 --> 36:58.148
that she's not introducing any
parasites or anything into our collection.

36:58.150 --> 37:00.750
And then we will start a
very slow introduction process

37:00.752 --> 37:02.185
<i>based on their behavior.</i>

37:02.187 --> 37:03.920
- [Casey] You, guys, ready?
- [Bethany] Yep.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.355
[Casey]
This is where I drop it.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.962
[Bethany] Aw, she's so cute.

37:12.029 --> 37:13.396
Oh, my goodness.

37:14.832 --> 37:15.932
Oh, my gosh, she's so cute.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.068
[laughing]

37:18.070 --> 37:19.803
I was expecting her
to have adult plumage

37:19.805 --> 37:21.905
because I just didn't even
think about it.

37:21.907 --> 37:25.909
So, it's really nice to see
a juvenile white-naped crane.

37:25.911 --> 37:29.212
And I'm really hoping for
babies out of this pair someday.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.281
[Casey] It's a good relief.

37:31.849 --> 37:34.150
- [Bethany] Yeah, she doesn't seem too bothered at all.
- [Casey] No.

37:34.152 --> 37:35.318
She looks good.

37:36.854 --> 37:37.654
I think he found her.

37:37.656 --> 37:38.621
[Jeff] Yeah.

37:41.826 --> 37:44.027
[Casey] I'm proud
that everything went well.

37:44.029 --> 37:47.097
I mean, this is a vulnerable
species in the wild.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.231
There's only about 5,000.

37:48.233 --> 37:51.434
And we have a nice, good
breeding program here in zoos

37:51.436 --> 37:53.737
<i>that is going to help keep
these birds alive.</i>

37:53.739 --> 37:56.039
<i>It's great to see her,
it's great to see her mate.</i>

37:56.041 --> 37:58.041
<i>I know that they are going
to do good things</i>

37:58.043 --> 37:59.276
<i>up here with her.</i>

37:59.278 --> 38:01.011
It's a really important bird.

38:06.183 --> 38:09.452
[Alisha] All 15 silver langurs
are going to be together again.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.954
We're ready when you are.

38:15.660 --> 38:17.961
[man] Welcome.
Welcome to the Jungle World.

38:24.869 --> 38:26.736
<i>[Sara] We're ready
to take him back.</i>

38:26.738 --> 38:28.772
All right.
Got the crate set up?

38:28.774 --> 38:30.307
Hey, munchkin, are you ready?

38:31.142 --> 38:32.976
<i>Kip has been away
from Jungle World</i>

38:32.978 --> 38:35.712
and his social group
for almost three weeks.

38:35.714 --> 38:38.148
It would have been
three weeks tomorrow.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.784
<i>We are moving Kip back
from the health center</i>

38:40.786 --> 38:41.951
<i>to Jungle World today.</i>

38:43.888 --> 38:45.221
Let me put--

38:45.223 --> 38:47.924
Sit down and put this
over your lap first.

38:47.926 --> 38:48.891
He looks alright,

38:48.893 --> 38:50.560
<i>he looks bright,
he's jumping around.</i>

38:50.562 --> 38:53.930
Being handled,
he's strong in hand.

38:53.932 --> 38:57.033
<i>When you look at him, he looks
like a little, healthy bouncing monkey.</i>

38:57.035 --> 38:58.268
She's taking the temp.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.703
Okay.

38:59.705 --> 39:03.440
I'm just going to do one final
farewell exam on Kip today.

39:03.442 --> 39:05.675
[Dr. Drumm] <i>I've been wanting
to see that he's eating and active,</i>

39:05.677 --> 39:08.978
<i>that he doesn't have
any sort of fever.</i>

39:11.816 --> 39:14.884
-[Sara] So, you're happy? We can put him in his crate?
-[Dr. Drumm] I'm happy.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.753
Also, that his blood parameters,

39:16.755 --> 39:18.621
which have been
very slowly improving,

39:18.623 --> 39:20.690
but we finally have got
most to a point

39:20.692 --> 39:24.127
where we feel comfortable now.
I'm sending him home.

39:26.897 --> 39:28.865
- [Sara] Hey, thank you.
- [woman] Thank you.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.700
[Sara] Doctor Hannah.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.969
<i>[Dr. Drumm] We're all
very worried about him,</i>

39:32.971 --> 39:34.904
<i>and so to actually get
him through this,</i>

39:34.906 --> 39:36.306
it feels really good.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.681
[Alisha] Hi, handsome!

39:44.683 --> 39:48.184
Oh, my goodness!
Are you excited?

39:48.186 --> 39:49.953
When we found out Kip
was coming back,

39:49.955 --> 39:50.854
we were very excited,

39:50.856 --> 39:53.556
trying to get everything
ready for him.

39:53.558 --> 39:56.126
<i>We created a subgroup
to reintroduce him to,</i>

39:56.128 --> 39:58.228
<i>including his mother
and his sister.</i>

39:58.662 --> 39:59.496
Good boy, Kip.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.831
<i>So, we separate that subgroup,</i>

40:01.833 --> 40:05.135
<i>we kind of just stepped back
and we're mostly observing.</i>

40:05.137 --> 40:07.237
Hopefully, everybody gets along

40:07.239 --> 40:09.906
and they're just really
happy to see him.

40:09.908 --> 40:10.907
Who is in there?

40:10.909 --> 40:15.145
Oh, my goodness!
It's your mama!

40:15.147 --> 40:18.047
And then we'd introduce him
to the rest of his family,

40:18.049 --> 40:20.049
so all 15 silver langurs

40:20.051 --> 40:22.051
are going to be together again.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.955
We're ready when you are.

40:30.861 --> 40:33.096
All right.
I can't even see him.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.832
[Juliet]
That's him, down here.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.435
- He's on the rock.
- [Alisha] Oh, right there.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.069
All good. There he is.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.439
All right. There he goes.

40:44.008 --> 40:45.175
Looks good.

40:45.643 --> 40:46.409
He's really good.

40:48.913 --> 40:50.980
At least he's eating.
Wonderful.

40:51.015 --> 40:51.948
Hi.

40:52.015 --> 40:55.351
He came out and he's eating
all the food up.

40:56.554 --> 40:58.988
We've been waiting
for this moment for weeks.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.424
So, we're just very excited
that he came to this point.

41:02.993 --> 41:03.960
[Juliet]
When he was really sick,

41:03.962 --> 41:05.094
it was touch and go for a while,

41:05.096 --> 41:07.197
and so, to see him back here,

41:07.199 --> 41:08.898
in his exhibit with his family,

41:08.900 --> 41:11.868
it's such a huge relief,
and I'm really excited.

41:11.870 --> 41:14.037
[Alisha] Hi. I missed you.

41:15.372 --> 41:16.739
<i>[Sara] It feels good to have Kip</i>

41:16.741 --> 41:18.975
<i>back with his entire group.</i>

41:18.977 --> 41:21.377
These animals
are social animals.

41:22.413 --> 41:24.781
<i>And being with the bigger group,</i>

41:24.783 --> 41:26.449
<i>that's just good
for his energy, good for...</i>

41:26.884 --> 41:28.585
<i>good for him.</i>

41:28.587 --> 41:29.886
[Juliet]
With a mouthful of leaves!

41:29.888 --> 41:32.922
[Alisha] What a big boy!
Oh, my goodness.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.325
So, from here and in,
we're back to normal.

41:35.993 --> 41:37.927
Well, I'm very happy.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.162
[Sara] Yeah, for sure.

41:40.030 --> 41:43.266
