Family Guy has been

"At least everything's
back to normal,"

20:01.317 --> 20:03.118
as if something happened.

20:03.151 --> 20:04.920
When nothing happened!

20:04.953 --> 20:07.856
It was a complete waste
of everyone's time!

20:07.890 --> 20:10.125
(sad music plays)

20:14.330 --> 20:16.465
Well, I'm glad all this
Emmy nonsense is over

20:16.499 --> 20:17.900
and things are
back to normal.

20:17.933 --> 20:19.368
Yeah, me, too.

20:19.402 --> 20:20.903
You know, I may not get Emmys,

20:20.936 --> 20:24.206
but I do get the best award
of all: my family.

20:24.239 --> 20:26.642
And this e-mail
from a young fan.

20:26.675 --> 20:28.076
"Dear sir,
your show helped me

20:28.110 --> 20:29.578
when I was going
through chemotherapy."

20:29.612 --> 20:31.480
Aw.

20:31.514 --> 20:34.583
"My favorite episode was when
Homer stays home from church..."

20:34.617 --> 20:36.118
Ah, damn it,
he thinks we're The Simpsons.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.953
Hey, what do you say,
one last try?

20:37.986 --> 20:39.322
Why not?

20:39.355 --> 20:40.989
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:41.023 --> 20:44.126
please enjoy this spectacular,
live-action chicken fight,

20:44.159 --> 20:45.494
starring Ty Burrell.

20:45.528 --> 20:46.962
Good night!

20:46.995 --> 20:49.064
(weak chirping)

20:49.097 --> 20:51.600
Shh. Shh.

20:51.634 --> 20:55.270
(weak chirping)

20:55.304 --> 20:57.373
I don't have any more
room in my house.
