00:02.556 --> 00:05.689
In 2166, an immortal
tyrant named Vandal Savage

00:05.691 --> 00:08.325
conquered the world and
murdered my wife and child.

00:08.327 --> 00:11.294
I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time

00:11.296 --> 00:12.794
and stop his rise to power.

00:12.796 --> 00:15.231
Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body

00:15.233 --> 00:18.334
I'd sworn my allegiance
to, the Time Masters.

00:18.336 --> 00:20.636
In the future, my
friends may not be heroes,

00:20.638 --> 00:22.471
but if we succeed,

00:22.473 --> 00:25.841
they will be remembered as legends.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.644
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:29.646 --> 00:31.246
His name is Chronos.

00:31.248 --> 00:33.013
He works for the Council of Time Masters.

00:33.015 --> 00:35.182
Chronos was clearly sent to bring me in.

00:35.184 --> 00:36.817
The Lazarus Pit brought me back,

00:36.819 --> 00:39.954
but it left me with this need to kill.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.256
Sara! Sara, don't!

00:42.725 --> 00:44.191
I'm dangerous.

00:44.193 --> 00:46.193
Up until two months ago, I was a barista,

00:46.195 --> 00:48.362
not some damn winged demigoddess.

00:48.364 --> 00:49.929
Be the person, the woman,

00:49.931 --> 00:52.065
the warrior you were meant to be.

00:57.239 --> 01:01.055
_

01:03.225 --> 01:04.443
That wasn't so bad, was it?

01:04.444 --> 01:06.712
Walk in the park. So where are we now?

01:06.714 --> 01:09.749
Washington, D.C.
The year is 1986.

01:09.751 --> 01:11.984
We've landed at the height of the Cold War

01:11.986 --> 01:15.020
in a world poised for nuclear annihilation.

01:15.022 --> 01:16.922
We've traveled here
because I have a new lead

01:16.924 --> 01:18.782
on Vandal Savage's location.

01:18.783 --> 01:19.849
Yes.

01:20.203 --> 01:21.326
Gideon managed to intercept
this telefax concerning

01:21.328 --> 01:22.661
Savage's last known whereabouts.

01:22.663 --> 01:23.961
Tele-what?

01:23.963 --> 01:25.263
It's like an email...

01:25.265 --> 01:26.598
on paper.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.767
Wow, that's totally useless.

01:28.769 --> 01:30.201
Dude, this whole thing's crossed out.

01:30.203 --> 01:31.770
Yeah, redacted by the U.S. government,

01:31.772 --> 01:33.538
which is why we are here
to steal the original file

01:33.540 --> 01:36.474
on Savage back from those
who are tracking him.

01:39.110 --> 01:41.679
Uh, that's the...

01:41.681 --> 01:42.879
Now, now...

01:42.881 --> 01:45.416
Don't worry. We are cloaked.

01:45.418 --> 01:47.685
You want us to break in to the Pentagon?

01:47.687 --> 01:48.752
Sounds awesome.

01:48.754 --> 01:49.853
It sounds crazy.

01:49.855 --> 01:51.087
What's the plan?

01:51.089 --> 01:52.589
Oh, the Fabricator will fashion you

01:52.591 --> 01:54.291
the necessary Pentagon credentials.

01:54.293 --> 01:57.893
Ooh, and don't forget our G-man disguises.

01:57.895 --> 01:59.829
I always wanted to be a spy.

02:13.410 --> 02:16.545
Now, the file we're after is
kept in a secure records room.

02:16.547 --> 02:19.180
In order to gain access,
we're going to need to, uh,

02:19.182 --> 02:20.949
borrow a magnetic key card.

02:20.951 --> 02:23.184
Because this is so much
easier than just shrinking down

02:23.186 --> 02:24.686
and stealing it.

02:24.688 --> 02:27.622
Let me show you how it's done...

02:27.624 --> 02:29.490
old school.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.460
You okay, ma'am?

02:32.462 --> 02:35.896
I wasn't watching where I was going.

02:35.898 --> 02:36.864
Thank you.

02:36.866 --> 02:38.165
Just doing my job.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.705
That's a nifty little trick.

02:44.707 --> 02:46.673
Really?

02:46.675 --> 02:49.008
We're trying to save the world
and you're lifting wallets?

02:49.010 --> 02:50.677
It's called multitasking.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074

03:08.128 --> 03:10.629
The records room has
closed-circuit cameras.

03:10.631 --> 03:11.864
We need a diversion.

03:11.866 --> 03:14.433
Someone call my name?

03:14.435 --> 03:16.001
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

03:27.414 --> 03:29.714
Double or nothing says I put this punk

03:29.716 --> 03:31.215
on the pinewood.

03:31.217 --> 03:32.683
Yeah, I'll take a piece of that action.

03:34.220 --> 03:35.653
We got the file.

03:35.655 --> 03:37.153
Okay, now for the tricky part.

03:37.155 --> 03:39.222
All personnel are subject to search

03:39.224 --> 03:41.892
upon exiting the Pentagon.

03:41.894 --> 03:46.162
Firestorm will divert the power
long enough for you to exit.

03:46.164 --> 03:48.164
Ready when you are.

03:50.569 --> 03:53.236
All clear.

03:55.706 --> 03:57.372
What did you do, Jefferson?

03:57.374 --> 03:59.007
I warned you about the
electromagnetic pulse.

03:59.009 --> 04:00.543
Now you've touched a neutral wire,

04:00.545 --> 04:02.010
causing the power to pass through us.

04:02.012 --> 04:03.913
You mean, "Pass through me."

04:03.915 --> 04:06.181
If you knew anything about
alternating current power...

04:06.183 --> 04:07.583
- Gray?
- Yes, Jefferson?

04:07.585 --> 04:08.585
Shut up.

04:14.290 --> 04:16.524
The alarm!

04:16.526 --> 04:18.726
This is a restricted exit.

04:18.728 --> 04:20.528
Sorry, we must have gotten lost.

04:20.529 --> 04:22.396
I'm going to need to
see your key card, ma'am.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.601
We have a Code Seven violation.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.310
We have a slight problem.

04:40.783 --> 04:42.115
It's been fun, fellas.

04:42.117 --> 04:43.425
Back!

04:47.621 --> 04:48.955
Where is that smoke coming from?

04:48.957 --> 04:50.155
Ah!

04:50.157 --> 04:51.757
We've got the file.

04:51.759 --> 04:52.959
What the hell does
Kendra think she's doing?

04:55.930 --> 04:56.930
Good question.

04:59.634 --> 05:01.500
All right, wonderful,
we've got a demigoddess

05:01.502 --> 05:02.834
who's gone completely berserk.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.603
Abort. I repeat, abort.

05:04.605 --> 05:05.937
Get back to ship right now.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.772
Roger that.

05:10.342 --> 05:11.843
I meant, "Use the door,"

05:11.845 --> 05:13.512
but while you're at it, can you help return

05:13.514 --> 05:15.313
our winged avenger to her cage?

05:24.890 --> 05:27.157
Instead of dwelling on what went wrong,

05:27.159 --> 05:29.359
let's focus on the positive.

05:29.361 --> 05:31.161
What are you talking about? It was awesome.

05:31.163 --> 05:32.963
In the same way that tsunamis, earthquakes,

05:32.965 --> 05:34.698
and other natural disasters are "awesome."

05:34.700 --> 05:36.666
We got the file on Savage.

05:36.668 --> 05:38.200
Despite the hiccup with the alarm?

05:38.202 --> 05:39.969
Oh, so it's my fault now?

05:39.971 --> 05:41.871
You know, maybe if you
weren't always yammering away

05:41.873 --> 05:43.640
in my head, I could actually focus.

05:43.642 --> 05:45.642
You have access to 60 years
of knowledge and experience.

05:45.644 --> 05:47.476
Why not just take advantage of that?

05:47.478 --> 05:49.712
Because it's my body on the
line out there, not yours.

05:49.714 --> 05:51.614
Hey, it's not your fault.

05:51.616 --> 05:53.682
Everything would have been
fine if Big Bird over here

05:53.684 --> 05:55.017
hadn't freaked out.

05:55.019 --> 05:56.317
- Excuse me?
- Enough.

05:56.319 --> 05:59.021
There is plenty of blame to go around.

05:59.023 --> 06:01.790
Now, fortunately, Gideon was
able to generate a low-end EMP,

06:01.792 --> 06:03.825
which erased all the
Pentagon's magnetic media.

06:03.827 --> 06:05.661
Like security footage?

06:05.663 --> 06:07.328
Look, you're just lucky that
the Department of Defense

06:07.330 --> 06:08.897
likes to keep incidents
like this under wraps.

06:08.899 --> 06:11.566
Gideon, any luck with
our purloined secret file?

06:11.568 --> 06:13.534
- Please say yes.
- Yes, Captain.

06:13.536 --> 06:15.870
According to the Pentagon,
Savage has defected

06:15.872 --> 06:17.773
to the Soviet Union.

06:17.774 --> 06:22.008
So the most powerful evil
the world has ever known

06:22.010 --> 06:24.010
has just gone red at the
height of the Cold War.

06:24.012 --> 06:25.844
And now he's gonna help
them cook up something

06:25.846 --> 06:28.013
that kills the future.

06:28.015 --> 06:30.749
Gideon, set a course...

06:30.751 --> 06:32.918
for the Soviet Union.

06:37.490 --> 06:39.625
Captain, we've just crossed
into Soviet airspace.

06:39.627 --> 06:41.626
Don't worry, Jefferson,
we are moving far too fast

06:41.628 --> 06:43.594
for anyone to track us.

06:43.596 --> 06:46.296
I'm afraid that's not true.
Someone is tracking us.

06:50.336 --> 06:51.869
I thought this ship was cloaked.

06:51.871 --> 06:54.005
It is.

06:54.007 --> 06:55.272
Boba Fett's back.

06:55.274 --> 06:56.674
Chronos must have followed us

06:56.676 --> 06:58.542
when we made the jump from the '70s.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.844
Sir, we have a lock on the WaveRider.

07:00.846 --> 07:02.211
Prepare to fire.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.780
He's closing fast.

07:03.782 --> 07:05.214
Captain, what would
you like me to do?

07:05.216 --> 07:06.516
Slow down, drop our cloak,

07:06.518 --> 07:08.151
and make as much noise as possible.

07:08.153 --> 07:10.186
Whoa, that's, like, top
three on the list of things

07:10.188 --> 07:11.387
we definitely shouldn't do.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.023
Just trust me.

07:17.994 --> 07:19.361
We run out of gas or something?

07:19.363 --> 07:20.562
Chronos is still in pursuit.

07:20.564 --> 07:22.230
Weapons systems tracking.

07:22.232 --> 07:24.499
Look, if this is your idea of
trying to lose him, then, m...

07:24.501 --> 07:25.834
Uh-huh.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.536
The Soviet Air Force to the rescue.

07:27.538 --> 07:29.805
Now, let's see how badly
Chronos wants to follow us.

07:34.556 --> 07:36.156
Wow, it's a MiG-21.

07:36.158 --> 07:37.892
No one's ever been this
close to one before.

07:37.894 --> 07:39.894
Are you quoting "Top Gun"?

07:39.896 --> 07:40.995
Maybe.

07:43.732 --> 07:45.332
I've got heat-seeking missiles

07:45.334 --> 07:46.968
closing at a distance
of less than a mile.

07:46.970 --> 07:48.635
Which is why I need you to cut the engines.

07:48.637 --> 07:52.271
Whoa, wait, don't we need those to land?

07:52.273 --> 07:54.273
I said, "Cut them," Gideon.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.980
Missiles are now targeting
something else.

07:59.982 --> 08:01.982
Chronos.

08:05.186 --> 08:07.486
I suggest you all strap yourselves in.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.187
It's going to be a bit of a bumpy landing.

08:09.189 --> 08:13.626
Initiating emergency
landing protocol.

08:13.628 --> 08:15.094
How's it going, Gideon?

08:15.096 --> 08:16.528
There's not much more I can do.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.297
Elevation is 5,000. 4,000. 3,000.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.666
When I said, "bumpy,"

08:20.668 --> 08:24.168
I meant, "Prepare for crash landing."

08:34.932 --> 08:38.568
_

08:39.057 --> 08:40.758
Good news, Captain.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.293
Despite our rough landing,

08:42.294 --> 08:44.295
the ship is still fully operational.

08:44.297 --> 08:46.364
Welcome to the U.S.S.R., gentlemen.

08:49.367 --> 08:50.834
If it were up to me, they would revoke

08:50.836 --> 08:52.136
your pilot's license.

08:52.138 --> 08:54.304
"They" are more than welcome to,

08:54.306 --> 08:57.040
considering I don't have one.

08:57.042 --> 08:59.143
Did you get anything on
Savage from the Pentagon file?

08:59.145 --> 09:00.844
It appears our friend has been quite busy

09:00.846 --> 09:01.945
since we last saw him.

09:01.947 --> 09:03.247
Svarog?

09:03.249 --> 09:05.714
God of fire in Slavic mythology

09:05.716 --> 09:08.117
a secret project the
Soviets are working on.

09:08.119 --> 09:09.918
Considering Savage's involvement,

09:09.920 --> 09:12.622
most likely some sort of weapon.

09:12.624 --> 09:14.056
Valentina Vostok.

09:14.058 --> 09:16.025
Graduated top of her physics program

09:16.027 --> 09:17.726
and then just dropped out of academia.

09:17.728 --> 09:20.196
To help develop Savage's
new weapon, no doubt.

09:20.198 --> 09:21.764
The Cold War's up for grabs,

09:21.766 --> 09:23.532
and Miss Vostok is the linchpin.

09:23.534 --> 09:25.400
I say we put two in the back of her head

09:25.402 --> 09:27.369
and call it a day.

09:27.371 --> 09:28.836
We have no idea who this woman is

09:28.838 --> 09:30.639
or what her effect may be on history.

09:30.641 --> 09:32.507
She may be the next Madame
Curie for all we know.

09:32.509 --> 09:34.643
She's working for Savage.
That's all we need to know.

09:34.645 --> 09:37.612
She probably has no idea
who's backing her research.

09:37.614 --> 09:39.713
Just let me approach her as a scientist,

09:39.715 --> 09:42.183
and we'll see what she knows
about Savage's weapons program.

09:42.185 --> 09:44.285
It's 1986, you're American,

09:44.287 --> 09:45.886
and you don't speak Russian.

09:45.888 --> 09:48.355
She'll have you pegged
as a spy in a second.

09:48.357 --> 09:49.517
Perhaps I can help with that.

09:52.994 --> 09:55.329
Ingestible translators.

09:55.331 --> 09:57.363
They attach to your larynx
via neural interface.

09:57.365 --> 09:59.065
Swallow them you can speak and understand

09:59.067 --> 10:00.766
any language spoken to you.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.205
How... how do you turn it on?

10:05.207 --> 10:07.240
Gideon? Switch them into Russian.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.277
Go on. Say something.

10:12.714 --> 10:14.913
_

10:14.915 --> 10:17.583
Wait, I'm still speaking English.

10:17.585 --> 10:19.539
_

10:21.698 --> 10:22.698
_

10:23.423 --> 10:26.124
I'm speaking Russian now, aren't I?

10:26.126 --> 10:27.926
Now you're annoying in multiple languages.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.728
Gideon, switch him back to English.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.697
Now, according to Vostok's file,

10:32.699 --> 10:33.931
she's a big fan of the ballet.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.433
She has box seats at the Bolshoi

10:35.435 --> 10:37.134
and attends every performance.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.536
It seems the final performance

10:38.538 --> 10:40.304
of "Le Roi Candaule" is today.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.805
Dr. Palmer, you will engage Vostok

10:41.807 --> 10:44.141
at the ballet, whilst you, Mr. Snart...

10:44.143 --> 10:45.409
you're going to be his wingman.

10:45.411 --> 10:46.744
Oy.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.712
Better go bone up on Vostok's CV.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.413
I guess I'll bone up on the ballet.

10:50.415 --> 10:52.649
Gideon, bone me.

10:54.385 --> 10:56.219
We have a problem.

10:56.221 --> 10:58.622
Right, you're going to have to
be a little bit more specific.

10:58.624 --> 11:00.323
It's Kendra.

11:00.325 --> 11:03.126
She's completely unstable.
You saw her at the Pentagon.

11:03.128 --> 11:04.993
That psycho priestess Chay-Ara took over

11:04.995 --> 11:06.295
and clawed a guard's eyes out.

11:06.297 --> 11:09.398
Perhaps Kendra just needs a bit of time.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.399
Remember, it was her
first time out in the field

11:10.401 --> 11:12.334
since Carter's death.

11:12.336 --> 11:14.270
Well, Carter's not going to be
the only dead body on our hands

11:14.272 --> 11:18.674
if someone doesn't get her under control.

11:18.676 --> 11:20.609
You know, perhaps you're right,

11:20.611 --> 11:22.644
and it just so happens

11:22.646 --> 11:25.647
I have the perfect candidate for the job.

11:25.649 --> 11:26.914
No.

11:26.916 --> 11:28.916
No, I was not talking about me.

11:28.918 --> 11:31.819
And yet, I can think of no
one better suited to the task.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.521
I'm not a fan of feelings.

11:33.523 --> 11:35.856
If Kendra needs someone to
talk through her grief with...

11:35.858 --> 11:37.158
Kendra needs someone to help her

11:37.160 --> 11:39.192
get her warrior side under control.

11:39.194 --> 11:40.594
I imagine you, above anyone else,

11:40.596 --> 11:42.596
know how to do that.

11:44.865 --> 11:46.333
This is a bad idea.

11:46.335 --> 11:49.336
_

12:01.715 --> 12:03.215
I got eyes on Vostok.

12:03.217 --> 12:05.150
She's headed straight for you, lover boy.

12:05.152 --> 12:06.585
All right, gentlemen.

12:06.587 --> 12:08.921
Everything's looking good from my end.

12:08.923 --> 12:11.724
Proceed.

12:11.726 --> 12:13.825
Ms. Vostok.

12:13.827 --> 12:15.760
Simon Huntsberger, University of Moscow

12:15.762 --> 12:18.863
physics department.

12:18.865 --> 12:21.065
I'm not interested in talking to student.

12:21.067 --> 12:23.000
If you want lecture, come by office hours.

12:23.002 --> 12:24.803
I'm actually a fellow scientist.

12:24.805 --> 12:26.237
I read your paper on applied physics

12:26.239 --> 12:27.706
and nuclear fusion.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.506
Perhaps, if you allow
me to take you to dinner,

12:29.508 --> 12:30.841
we can discuss in detail.

12:35.348 --> 12:37.481
Damn, that was cold,

12:37.483 --> 12:41.418
even by Russian standards.

12:41.420 --> 12:42.553
Heads-up.

12:44.856 --> 12:45.922
What the hell is this?

12:45.924 --> 12:47.390
Warriors train every day.

12:47.392 --> 12:50.860
Sorry, but I'm not in the mood.

12:50.862 --> 12:53.195
"Sorry" is not gonna help
that guard that you defaced

12:53.197 --> 12:54.296
at the Pentagon.

12:54.298 --> 12:56.766
Two months ago, I was a barista.

12:56.768 --> 12:59.134
I had no idea I had
some psycho hawk goddess

12:59.136 --> 13:00.436
inside of me,

13:00.438 --> 13:02.204
and then I meet Carter, and he convinces me

13:02.206 --> 13:06.675
to let her out, and now that he's gone...

13:06.677 --> 13:08.810
I can't control it,

13:08.812 --> 13:10.712
so thanks for the offer,

13:10.714 --> 13:13.448
but I won't risk letting
that monster out again.

13:13.450 --> 13:16.217
That monster inside you
is not gonna go away.

13:18.621 --> 13:20.288
You have to learn how to control her.

13:20.290 --> 13:22.122
And how, exactly, do
you expect me to do that?

13:25.627 --> 13:27.728
Let's find out.

13:33.936 --> 13:36.537
Temporal anomaly detected.

13:36.539 --> 13:38.037
Chronos.

13:38.039 --> 13:39.406
The Russian jet damaged his ship.

13:39.408 --> 13:41.274
He's still alive?

13:41.276 --> 13:43.743
He went down just outside
Moscow city limits.

13:43.745 --> 13:44.944
Mr. Rory,

13:44.946 --> 13:46.279
how would you like to accompany me

13:46.281 --> 13:47.647
on a little mission?

13:47.649 --> 13:48.915
Will I get to use my gun?

13:48.917 --> 13:50.650
A near-certain likelihood.

13:50.652 --> 13:52.051
Lead the way, Captain.

13:55.221 --> 13:56.889
You struck out, Raymond.

13:56.891 --> 13:58.657
Maybe I should take a crack at her.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.961
I think we may have gotten
off on the wrong foot.

14:02.963 --> 14:05.230
- I don't mean to bother you...
- Too late.

14:05.232 --> 14:07.599
But, as an investor, I'm in a position

14:07.601 --> 14:09.401
to fund your research.

14:09.403 --> 14:11.403
That is why I wanted us to meet.

14:11.405 --> 14:14.305
Easy, Raymond, you're gonna spook her.

14:16.408 --> 14:19.276
I think it's important to know
who's funding your research,

14:19.278 --> 14:20.645
don't you think?

14:20.647 --> 14:22.112
For instance...

14:22.114 --> 14:23.314
Project Svarog.

14:27.085 --> 14:30.620
Sorry, is this man bothering you?

14:30.622 --> 14:33.356
Don't trouble yourself. I'm
not a damsel in distress.

14:33.358 --> 14:36.159
Good, because I'm not a white knight.

14:38.997 --> 14:40.797
Seems intermission is over.

14:40.799 --> 14:43.633
You wouldn't want to miss
Queen Nisia dancing naked

14:43.635 --> 14:45.201
with the nymphs.

14:45.203 --> 14:49.037
My favorite part of the ballet,

14:49.039 --> 14:52.942
but I've seen it so many times.

14:52.944 --> 14:56.846
Perhaps, you wouldn't mind
walking me home instead.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.459
- I hate nature.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

15:11.461 --> 15:15.563
Thirty meters.

15:15.565 --> 15:17.732
Chronos must be hiding out in the trees.

15:20.702 --> 15:23.236
Is that any way to treat an old friend?

15:26.040 --> 15:28.041
Time Master Druce,

15:28.043 --> 15:29.610
how on earth did you find me?

15:29.612 --> 15:31.211
You haven't exactly been subtle.

15:31.213 --> 15:32.679
Can I waste this guy?

15:32.681 --> 15:34.114
Could you give us a moment?

15:34.116 --> 15:37.182
You said I'd get to use my gun.

15:39.386 --> 15:41.921
Hmm.

15:41.923 --> 15:45.357
What a colorful team you've
assembled for yourself.

15:45.359 --> 15:46.392
I thought that you were...

15:46.394 --> 15:48.427
Chronos?

15:48.429 --> 15:50.295
He was killed in the crash, I'm afraid.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.698
I was sent to scuttle his time ship,

15:52.700 --> 15:54.365
lest it be discovered by the Soviets.

15:54.367 --> 15:56.200
And you left a temporal anomaly.

15:56.202 --> 15:59.404
To lure you out of the cold, as it were.

15:59.406 --> 16:02.040
You've turned your back
on the very institution

16:02.042 --> 16:04.275
you were meant to serve.

16:04.277 --> 16:07.245
Our job is to protect time,

16:07.247 --> 16:09.047
thereby protecting all life.

16:09.049 --> 16:11.448
I am trying to save the world

16:11.450 --> 16:13.417
from complete destruction.

16:13.419 --> 16:15.218
You and your band of
rogues have run rampant

16:15.220 --> 16:16.587
throughout history.

16:16.589 --> 16:18.422
This is why we work alone, Rip.

16:18.424 --> 16:21.058
A team is a liability you've proven that.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.793
They keep you from
making the tough choices.

16:22.795 --> 16:24.628
I am here because the council refused

16:24.630 --> 16:26.764
to make that tough choice.

16:26.766 --> 16:29.866
Well, they can sometimes be
slow to realize the obvious,

16:29.868 --> 16:34.403
but I've been authorized
to offer you a deal.

16:34.405 --> 16:36.072
End this foolish crusade return with me

16:36.074 --> 16:37.640
to the vanishing point.

16:37.642 --> 16:41.110
You'll be acquitted of
all charges, and in...

16:41.112 --> 16:43.646
a few hundred years, we
may even be able to fix

16:43.648 --> 16:45.146
the damage you've caused.

16:45.148 --> 16:46.815
And what about my team?

16:46.817 --> 16:49.451
They will be returned to
their own timelines unharmed,

16:49.453 --> 16:53.421
which is more than I
can say for Carter Hall.

16:53.423 --> 16:55.423
You were one of my brightest pupils

16:55.425 --> 16:58.126
and by far my favorite.

16:58.128 --> 17:00.929
Will you at least consider my offer?

17:02.931 --> 17:05.633
I'll consult with my comrades.

17:05.635 --> 17:07.602
Please do, Rip,

17:07.604 --> 17:08.935
and then meet me here in an hour.

17:12.507 --> 17:14.608
And if I don't?

17:18.012 --> 17:19.512
Then you're beyond my help.

17:29.885 --> 17:31.185
That's a pretty sweet deal

17:31.187 --> 17:32.887
"Time Cop" offered you back there.

17:32.889 --> 17:34.687
Well, I see we can add "eavesdropping"

17:34.689 --> 17:36.422
to your criminal resume.

17:36.424 --> 17:39.926
Maybe you should start
thinking more like a crook.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.195
Your friend's planning on killing you.

17:42.197 --> 17:46.132
Time Master Druce is one
of my most trusted friends

17:46.134 --> 17:47.901
besides, if he wanted to do me any harm,

17:47.903 --> 17:49.869
why didn't he do it just
now when he had the chance?

17:49.871 --> 17:53.371
Because he wants you to
bring the whole team with you,

17:53.373 --> 17:54.940
and that's not gonna happen,

17:54.942 --> 17:57.109
because I'm taking a pass.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.222
Are we done here yet?

18:11.224 --> 18:12.589
If you want to harness your power,

18:12.591 --> 18:14.258
you need to learn to control your fear.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.327
Yeah, well, you've been
training for half your life

18:16.329 --> 18:18.262
to be some cold-blooded assassin,

18:18.264 --> 18:20.131
so I really don't think you
understand what it's like.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.399
Before you can control it,

18:22.401 --> 18:24.302
you have to accept that it's part of you.

18:26.671 --> 18:27.938
Ease up, will you?

18:27.940 --> 18:31.774
You've got to channel your anger.

18:31.776 --> 18:32.976
Sara, stop.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.678
Push down your emotions.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.247
Focus on your opponent.

18:42.085 --> 18:43.352
Kendra?

18:48.691 --> 18:50.159
Sara!

18:50.161 --> 18:51.760
Sara, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry...

18:55.299 --> 18:57.867
Sara, what are you doing? It's me!

19:19.755 --> 19:22.489
Are you sure you don't want your coat back?

19:22.491 --> 19:24.157
I can't believe how you're not freezing.

19:24.159 --> 19:26.793
Oh, I love the cold.

19:26.795 --> 19:28.428
And ballet.

19:28.430 --> 19:32.866
So what is it about the ballet
that you love, Valentina?

19:32.868 --> 19:35.801
The combination of grace and strength,

19:35.803 --> 19:38.404
pushing the body to its breaking point.

19:38.406 --> 19:40.439
It's a thing of beauty.

19:40.441 --> 19:42.441
My apartment.

19:42.443 --> 19:45.044
You know, this time of night,

19:45.046 --> 19:46.678
it's colder than a Siberian winter.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.514
It sounds perfect.

19:48.516 --> 19:50.481
You know, I'm sure we could heat it up.

19:50.483 --> 19:53.418
Sadly, I have business
elsewhere this evening.

19:53.420 --> 19:56.587
Well...

19:56.589 --> 19:58.689
if this is good-bye...

20:17.108 --> 20:20.411
You enjoy the show, Raymond?

20:20.413 --> 20:22.746
I think I've got frostbite
in some not-so-fun places

20:22.748 --> 20:24.414
from waiting out here.

20:24.416 --> 20:25.781
Did she tell you what kind of weapon

20:25.783 --> 20:26.783
Savage is building?

20:26.784 --> 20:28.484
Didn't come up.

20:28.486 --> 20:31.620
Such a romantic evening I
didn't want to spoil the mood.

20:31.622 --> 20:33.156
So other a steamy good night kiss

20:33.158 --> 20:35.091
and a possible case of hypothermia,

20:35.093 --> 20:36.093
we've got nothing.

20:36.094 --> 20:37.760
I wouldn't say that.

20:37.762 --> 20:40.229
It's Valentina's security
badge for a place called

20:40.231 --> 20:42.164
Luskavic Labs.

20:42.166 --> 20:44.166
Whatever weapon she's building for Savage,

20:44.168 --> 20:45.968
we'll find it there.

20:45.970 --> 20:48.337
I guess I should just be happy
you didn't swipe her wallet.

20:56.312 --> 20:57.812
So, uh, what happens?

20:57.814 --> 20:59.480
You hand over the ship and turn yourself in

20:59.482 --> 21:01.248
to the Time Masters, and
the rest of us just...

21:01.250 --> 21:02.984
Will be returned to your former lives

21:02.986 --> 21:04.952
in January 2016.

21:04.954 --> 21:06.487
It will be as if you never left.

21:06.489 --> 21:09.256
Aside from the fact that
Starling City might be part

21:09.258 --> 21:10.924
of the U.S.S.R., thanks to our efforts.

21:10.926 --> 21:12.626
All the more reason to consider the offer.

21:12.628 --> 21:14.795
The Time Council will do
everything within their power

21:14.797 --> 21:16.429
to correct the mistakes that we've made.

21:16.431 --> 21:18.131
But they still haven't changed their mind

21:18.133 --> 21:19.466
about stopping Savage?

21:19.468 --> 21:20.867
Well, according to them, he's part

21:20.869 --> 21:22.602
of the natural course of history,

21:22.604 --> 21:24.637
terrible as that course may be.

21:24.639 --> 21:26.139
Look, I'm not saying that this offer

21:26.141 --> 21:28.441
is without its downsides.

21:28.443 --> 21:30.143
If we abandon our plan
now, then I still lose

21:30.145 --> 21:31.145
my wife and son.

21:31.146 --> 21:32.944
So why throw in the towel?

21:32.946 --> 21:35.280
I thought you said this mission
was bigger than any one of us.

21:35.282 --> 21:37.483
Yes, but if you'll remember,
when I first recruited you,

21:37.485 --> 21:40.852
I wasn't entirely forthright
about my motivations

21:40.854 --> 21:45.519
or about how dangerous
this mission would be.

21:47.994 --> 21:50.294
Carter Hall knew the
risks before he signed on.

21:50.296 --> 21:52.517
Hmm.

21:53.299 --> 21:55.166
Well, for the rest of you,
it's now time to decide

21:55.168 --> 21:57.235
whether the future is worth fighting for.

22:09.213 --> 22:10.980
I cannot tell you

22:10.982 --> 22:15.218
how pleased I am to see you, Hunter.

22:15.220 --> 22:18.755
I finally came to my senses.

22:18.757 --> 22:20.524
You were right, as always.

22:20.526 --> 22:22.025
I've risked the lives of my team

22:22.027 --> 22:25.127
I've endangered the very
fabric of time itself.

22:25.129 --> 22:27.096
I only hope you can forgive me.

22:27.098 --> 22:30.766
All will soon be made right again.

22:30.768 --> 22:32.834
Hello, old friend.

22:32.836 --> 22:34.937
I'm so sorry it had to turn out this way,

22:34.939 --> 22:39.442
but the council cannot
risk keeping you alive.

22:39.444 --> 22:42.009
Such a shame.

22:42.011 --> 22:43.711
I won't be able to tell Mick he was right.

22:43.713 --> 22:45.113
Mick?

22:45.115 --> 22:47.515
My colorful friend, who was convinced

22:47.517 --> 22:48.983
you were planning on killing me.

22:48.985 --> 22:51.553
Your friends seem to have abandoned you,

22:51.555 --> 22:52.555
but no matter.

22:52.556 --> 22:53.888
Chronos will track them down.

22:53.890 --> 22:55.490
Can't believe you brought this stooge

22:55.492 --> 22:57.191
to do your dirty work.

22:57.193 --> 22:59.393
I never had you pegged as a coward, Druce.

22:59.395 --> 23:01.861
In that case, I promise to stay here

23:01.863 --> 23:05.065
to ensure that your punishment
is carried out properly.

23:05.067 --> 23:07.101
I wouldn't want you to die alone.

23:07.103 --> 23:10.104
Who says I'm alone?

23:15.075 --> 23:16.842
What a wuss.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.750
This is not the time to show off.

23:24.752 --> 23:26.586
It's best if we attack
from a covered position.

23:26.588 --> 23:27.987
I'm through playing it safe.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.256
This time, we do things my way.

23:41.167 --> 23:42.634
Run, punk! Run!

23:42.636 --> 23:44.336
Jefferson!

23:44.338 --> 23:46.838
Where is he? Chronos' blast
forced us to separate...

23:46.840 --> 23:48.405
I... I didn't see where he landed.

23:48.407 --> 23:49.973
Jax!

23:49.975 --> 23:51.509
Jefferson!

23:51.511 --> 23:53.977
All right, no need to
shout I'm right here.

23:53.979 --> 23:55.679
There you are, thank God you're okay.

23:55.681 --> 23:57.281
Why didn't you answer when I called you?

23:57.283 --> 23:58.949
Did it not occur to
you that I'd be worried?

23:58.951 --> 24:02.419
Look, I just got a... little lost.

24:05.856 --> 24:08.591
We need to get him to the med bay now.

24:15.003 --> 24:16.637
Oh, gentlemen, I trust everything went

24:16.639 --> 24:17.972
according to plan at the Bolshoi?

24:17.974 --> 24:19.407
Piece of cake.

24:19.409 --> 24:21.242
Made contact with Vostok
and swiped her badge.

24:21.244 --> 24:25.212
Thanks to me. Pretty boy
just froze his ass off.

24:28.550 --> 24:29.550
What happened to him?

24:29.551 --> 24:30.884
Chronos.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.019
- Jax here was...
- Almost got himself killed.

24:33.021 --> 24:34.521
And we need to get you to the med bay.

24:34.523 --> 24:35.655
Ah, the med bay,

24:35.657 --> 24:38.825
where a morphine drip awaits me.

24:38.827 --> 24:40.193
Now just try and take it slowly.

24:40.195 --> 24:41.661
Don't bother telling him what to do

24:41.663 --> 24:43.530
he'll just do the opposite.

24:43.532 --> 24:46.399
Oh, yeah, it would be
my fault that I got hurt,

24:46.401 --> 24:48.667
because I didn't listen to
you in your infinite wisdom.

24:48.669 --> 24:49.702
I am sorry, Professor.

24:49.704 --> 24:51.504
Exactly.

24:51.506 --> 24:55.207
It seems this... partnership
of ours has become untenable.

24:55.209 --> 24:56.209
Partnership?

24:56.210 --> 24:57.843
No, this is a dictatorship,

24:57.845 --> 24:59.512
one in which you get to call all the shots

24:59.514 --> 25:00.746
and I get to take all the shots.

25:00.748 --> 25:02.447
Do you think I like seeing you hurt?

25:02.449 --> 25:04.616
Don't act like you
actually care about me, man.

25:04.618 --> 25:06.518
I'm just a life-support system.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.352
I didn't even want to
come on this stupid trip.

25:08.354 --> 25:10.121
- You kidnapped me.
- Oh, this old tune.

25:10.123 --> 25:12.724
Did you ever stop to think
that I actually had a life

25:12.726 --> 25:13.892
back in 2016?

25:13.894 --> 25:16.127
I almost forgot a promising career

25:16.129 --> 25:17.261
as an auto mechanic.

25:17.263 --> 25:19.763
I had a mom,

25:19.765 --> 25:21.899
a widow.

25:21.901 --> 25:23.701
What happens to her if
something happens to me

25:23.702 --> 25:24.702
in 1986?

25:24.703 --> 25:26.136
Huh?

25:26.138 --> 25:27.771
She's just gonna think that I left her

25:27.773 --> 25:29.372
without even saying good-bye.

25:29.374 --> 25:31.274
Man, do you have any idea
what that does to her?

25:31.276 --> 25:33.777
We've all made sacrifices.

25:33.779 --> 25:36.779
But can't you see that this
mission, stopping Savage,

25:36.781 --> 25:38.147
is bigger than any one of us?

25:38.149 --> 25:40.883
I am so sick of you using that tone.

25:40.885 --> 25:44.286
When are you gonna learn
you are not my father?

25:44.288 --> 25:47.757
I'm sorry you lost him
at such a tender age,

25:47.759 --> 25:50.927
but if your father were here, right now,

25:50.929 --> 25:52.829
he'd be saying what I'm saying.

25:52.831 --> 25:54.830
Just grow up, Jefferson.

25:54.832 --> 25:57.265
The future of the world is at stake,

25:57.267 --> 25:59.033
and if you insist on
getting yourself killed,

25:59.035 --> 26:02.504
as terrible as that might
be for your mother, or me,

26:02.506 --> 26:05.774
who, incidentally, would also die,

26:05.776 --> 26:08.176
I am more concerned with
the billions of people

26:08.178 --> 26:09.878
who will die because of your...

26:09.880 --> 26:12.145
arrogant adolescent ego!

26:15.183 --> 26:17.451
Okay.

26:24.527 --> 26:26.961
Please don't... don't... Don't say it.

26:26.963 --> 26:28.461
I was cruel

26:28.463 --> 26:32.264
and unjustified, and
I... I said those things

26:32.266 --> 26:36.469
just for the sake of hurting him.

26:36.471 --> 26:38.638
Why aren't you telling that to Jax?

26:38.640 --> 26:42.274
I had to hurt him,
Raymond it's the only way

26:42.276 --> 26:43.442
I can get through to him.

26:43.444 --> 26:45.043
I've tried everything else.

26:45.045 --> 26:46.478
Well, he's just a kid.

26:46.480 --> 26:52.017
So was Ronald, and look
what happened to him.

26:52.019 --> 26:54.586
Your former half of Firestorm.

26:54.588 --> 26:56.121
Yes.

26:56.123 --> 27:01.559
I can't... I... I can't
go through this again.

27:01.561 --> 27:05.162
I can't lose another.

27:05.164 --> 27:07.832
The reason I'm constantly
lecturing Jefferson

27:07.834 --> 27:10.234
is because I'm the one
who brought him along,

27:10.236 --> 27:13.303
and if something happens,

27:13.305 --> 27:17.207
I'm the one who has to go back to 2016

27:17.209 --> 27:19.509
and tell his mother that her little boy

27:19.511 --> 27:22.579
is never coming home,

27:22.581 --> 27:24.414
and I would rather die than do that.

27:32.322 --> 27:34.357
That looks sore. What happened?

27:34.359 --> 27:36.058
Maybe you should ask the lunatic

27:36.060 --> 27:38.694
you put in charge of training me.

27:38.696 --> 27:41.329
I... actually, I was
hoping that the arrangement

27:41.331 --> 27:43.866
between you and Sara might be, uh...

27:43.868 --> 27:45.434
mutually beneficial.

27:45.436 --> 27:49.038
You mean you knew about
this bloodlust thing?

27:49.040 --> 27:51.907
It's the captain's job to
know everything on his ship.

27:51.909 --> 27:55.543
Look, Sara went through hell
when she was resurrected,

27:55.545 --> 27:58.245
and I was hoping that you'd be able to...

27:58.247 --> 28:00.915
coax out her human side from the darkness

28:00.917 --> 28:02.550
of the Lazarus Pit.

28:02.552 --> 28:03.885
Why me?

28:03.887 --> 28:06.287
Well, after 4,000 years of reincarnation,

28:06.289 --> 28:09.457
surely you know a thing
or two about rebirth.

28:14.896 --> 28:16.296
Heads up!

28:19.033 --> 28:21.902
Let's go.

28:21.904 --> 28:25.706
"A warrior trains every day," remember?

28:25.708 --> 28:28.240
I'm not a warrior, and I tried to kill you

28:28.242 --> 28:30.476
the last time we did this, remember?

28:30.478 --> 28:32.912
"Tried" being the operative word.

28:36.483 --> 28:39.051
Look, you want to know my theory?

28:39.053 --> 28:40.586
No.

28:40.588 --> 28:43.255
I think your problem
is the opposite of mine.

28:43.257 --> 28:46.491
I need to learn to embrace
my inner hawk goddess,

28:46.493 --> 28:50.895
but you... you need to learn
to embrace your human side.

28:50.897 --> 28:53.564
And what if that side of me is gone?

28:53.566 --> 28:55.800
What if she doesn't exist anymore?

28:55.802 --> 28:59.838
Well, only one way to find out.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.271
What, are you baiting me?

29:01.273 --> 29:03.140
No,

29:03.142 --> 29:04.775
I'm training you.

29:07.478 --> 29:09.479
Come on.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.349
Are you scared?

29:22.492 --> 29:24.027
Here we are, Luskavic Labs,

29:24.029 --> 29:25.695
the secret facility where Vostok works.

29:25.697 --> 29:27.830
- So what's the plan?
- Simple.

29:27.832 --> 29:29.598
We use Vostok's
credentials to enter the lab

29:29.600 --> 29:31.701
and find out what she's
building on behalf of Savage.

29:31.703 --> 29:33.069
Reconnaissance in a laboratory.

29:33.071 --> 29:34.336
Finally, my kind of mission.

29:34.338 --> 29:35.937
No, no, no, hang on a minute

29:35.939 --> 29:37.973
Jefferson's still
recovering from his injuries.

29:37.975 --> 29:40.375
This is hardly a job for Firestorm

29:40.377 --> 29:41.677
let him rest.

29:46.849 --> 29:48.817
_

29:52.954 --> 29:55.956
_

30:04.633 --> 30:07.702
I'm Dr. Gregor Gavrilov of
the State Council of Science,

30:07.704 --> 30:10.904
and I'm here to inspect the facility.

30:10.906 --> 30:12.906
I'm in and heading to the basement.

30:20.582 --> 30:22.381
Here's hoping the key that Mr. Snart stole

30:22.383 --> 30:24.050
off Valentina works.

30:40.100 --> 30:41.666
Oh, my God.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.544
I know what Vostok is working on.

30:53.546 --> 30:55.780
She's trying to build... me.

30:55.782 --> 30:57.448
What do you mean?

30:57.450 --> 30:59.683
I mean, Savage has spent
the last decade trying

30:59.685 --> 31:01.451
to level the arms
race against our team.

31:01.453 --> 31:04.554
Operation Svarog.

31:04.556 --> 31:06.757
Slavic God of fire, of course.

31:06.759 --> 31:09.726
He and Vostok are building

31:09.728 --> 31:12.528
a Soviet Firestorm.

31:25.542 --> 31:27.543
They've already built a thermal core.

31:27.545 --> 31:28.778
Professor, need I remind you,

31:28.780 --> 31:31.546
this is a reconnaissance mission.

31:31.548 --> 31:33.615
It's only a matter of time
before Vostok figures out

31:33.617 --> 31:37.252
how to stabilize a Soviet Firestorm.

31:40.157 --> 31:41.723
I'm not leaving without it.

31:41.725 --> 31:43.558
It's the key to building
others just like me.

31:43.560 --> 31:46.461
Yes, but perhaps you should
wait for the rest of the team.

31:46.463 --> 31:47.896
They're on their way.

31:47.898 --> 31:49.330
Are you familiar
with ultra-high-energy

31:49.332 --> 31:51.231
cosmic rays, Captain?

31:51.233 --> 31:53.066
The radiation released inside this chamber

31:53.068 --> 31:55.102
will kill anyone other than me.

31:55.104 --> 31:56.270
Look, despite your impermeability

31:56.272 --> 31:57.772
to nuclear energy,

31:57.774 --> 31:59.607
you're still quite vulnerable to bullets.

31:59.609 --> 32:01.409
I just need someone to
take the core offline,

32:01.411 --> 32:03.744
so I can remove it safely and shield it.

32:03.746 --> 32:04.945
I'm all over it, Professor.

32:08.616 --> 32:10.350
We're all over it.

32:10.352 --> 32:12.251
Remember, Dr. Palmer,
that shutting down the core

32:12.253 --> 32:14.120
incorrectly can lead
to the creation of...

32:14.122 --> 32:15.955
Strangeness, black holes, and uncontrolled

32:15.957 --> 32:18.024
fusion reactions that consume the universe?

32:18.026 --> 32:20.681
See? I was listening
during class, Professor.

32:30.504 --> 32:32.070
How we doing, Boy Scout?

32:32.072 --> 32:34.473
Uh, point of fact, I
completed all 21 merit badges,

32:34.475 --> 32:37.309
including nuclear science,
so I'm an Eagle Scout.

32:39.712 --> 32:41.479
Uh-oh. We got a problem.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.648
Valentina's headed toward
the core containment unit.

32:43.650 --> 32:45.282
The radiation Stein's about to unleash...

32:45.284 --> 32:46.851
I... if she opens the door...

32:46.853 --> 32:48.486
We're here to stop Savage from building

32:48.488 --> 32:50.321
a nuclear-powered superhero.

32:50.323 --> 32:53.224
Saving some commie broad
ain't on the agenda.

32:53.226 --> 32:55.326
Even if the radiation
doesn't kill her, Savage will,

32:55.328 --> 32:57.361
the second he finds out
the lab's been sabotaged.

32:57.363 --> 32:59.028
Look, we gotta get her out of here.

32:59.030 --> 33:01.164
Well, who's gonna shut
down the core, Raymond?

33:01.166 --> 33:02.699
I skipped that merit badge.

33:02.701 --> 33:04.267
Raymond, why is the thermal core

33:04.269 --> 33:05.869
still running at full power?

33:05.871 --> 33:07.704
I'll handle the core. You handle Valentina.

33:07.706 --> 33:09.373
You're willing to risk the mission

33:09.375 --> 33:11.908
for a woman you barely know?

33:11.910 --> 33:13.909
Be helpful to others.

33:13.911 --> 33:14.977
It's the Scout motto.

33:14.979 --> 33:16.412
30 seconds.

33:16.414 --> 33:18.714
I'll get Vostok, you
kill the power for Stein,

33:18.716 --> 33:20.383
and, Raymond,

33:20.385 --> 33:22.651
promise me.

33:31.527 --> 33:33.060
Bad idea.

33:33.062 --> 33:34.496
What are you doing here?

33:34.498 --> 33:35.997
Believe me, I've been asking myself

33:35.999 --> 33:38.566
the same question.

33:38.568 --> 33:40.602
That night at the Bolshoi.

33:40.604 --> 33:42.036
It was you who stole my keys.

33:42.038 --> 33:46.007
And your wallet, but
it was nothing personal.

33:46.009 --> 33:47.275
What the hell is that man doing?

33:47.277 --> 33:48.909
He has no idea what the core is capable of.

33:48.911 --> 33:50.176
Relax.

33:50.178 --> 33:53.614
He's the one who invented it.

34:01.424 --> 34:03.757
I'm the first person to have ever seen

34:03.759 --> 34:06.759
cosmic radiation with his own eyes.

34:06.761 --> 34:08.092
You know, let's keep it that way.

34:08.094 --> 34:09.562
Snart, you better keep Valentina out

34:09.563 --> 34:10.763
of the core containment unit.

34:10.764 --> 34:12.398
You used me.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.800
You work for American government.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.467
I'm wanted by the American government.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.570
Does that count?

34:17.572 --> 34:20.440
Look, I may be your white
knight just this once,

34:20.442 --> 34:22.873
but that weapon Savage has you building?

34:22.876 --> 34:25.911
He's creating a nuclear-powered monster.

34:29.449 --> 34:30.949
I know.

34:30.951 --> 34:32.417
It was sweet of you to think of me

34:32.418 --> 34:34.385
as a damsel in distress,

34:34.387 --> 34:36.554
but...

34:36.556 --> 34:38.621
I'm not the one who needs rescuing.

34:38.623 --> 34:41.458
Don't flatter yourself, sweetheart.

34:41.460 --> 34:42.927
I'm not the sentimental type.

34:42.929 --> 34:44.895
No, but your partner,

34:44.897 --> 34:47.331
the physicist with the big brown eyes,

34:47.333 --> 34:48.732
is.

34:48.734 --> 34:51.768
Turn the core back online.

34:51.771 --> 34:53.504
You will turn it back
on, or I will put a bullet

34:53.505 --> 34:54.505
in your friend's head.

34:54.507 --> 34:55.972
Don't you dare.

34:55.974 --> 34:58.608
She's gonna shoot me
whether you do it or not.

34:58.610 --> 35:00.477
That may be true,

35:00.479 --> 35:02.278
and you can take that gamble if you like.

35:02.280 --> 35:05.114
It's only his life you wager.

35:05.116 --> 35:07.149
Almost there.

35:07.151 --> 35:08.852
I'm not joking, Raymond.

35:08.854 --> 35:10.954
Don't you dare push that button.

35:18.461 --> 35:19.661
Raymond, what's going on?

35:19.663 --> 35:21.129
The core just went back online.

35:21.131 --> 35:22.531
Sorry, Professor, I had to do it.

35:22.533 --> 35:25.166
You idiot.

35:27.804 --> 35:30.872
I... I can still remove it.

35:30.874 --> 35:34.008
I just hope I can absorb the excess power.

35:34.010 --> 35:36.110
No. Do you have any idea
the kind of energy that...

35:39.180 --> 35:41.782
Should have listened to your friend.

35:41.784 --> 35:43.283
What the hell are you doing, Gray?

35:43.285 --> 35:44.986
Jefferson?

35:44.988 --> 35:47.988
You are not Firestorm,
you're just a stubborn old man

35:47.990 --> 35:50.056
who's about to make a
really stupid decision.

35:50.058 --> 35:51.357
Wait, I... is this what it's like

35:51.359 --> 35:53.192
when I'm in your head?

35:53.194 --> 35:56.329
I... I apologize, dear boy,
because it's rather distracting.

35:56.331 --> 35:59.098
Your body cannot handle this alone.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.234
Appreciate your concern.

36:01.236 --> 36:03.503
You were right.

36:03.505 --> 36:05.871
I've risked your life enough times.

36:05.873 --> 36:07.873
Now, it's my turn.

36:09.208 --> 36:10.208
No!

36:31.296 --> 36:33.097
He's too weak.

36:33.099 --> 36:35.066
<i>He'll never get out of there alone.</i>

36:41.440 --> 36:43.574
Professor Stein,

36:43.576 --> 36:45.341
your comrade here tells
me you know quite a bit

36:45.343 --> 36:46.910
about this project of mine.

36:46.912 --> 36:48.445
Very good.

36:48.447 --> 36:50.847
You and I have much to discuss.

37:03.031 --> 37:04.331
What are you waiting for?

37:04.333 --> 37:07.201
You forget how to use that thing?

37:07.203 --> 37:09.303
My employer, Mr. Savage,
would very much like

37:09.305 --> 37:12.706
to meet you and the rest of your friends.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.809
Careful what you wish for.

37:14.811 --> 37:16.244
This where the party's at?

37:27.588 --> 37:30.390
Aah!

37:30.392 --> 37:31.958
Mr. Snart, can you hear me?

37:31.960 --> 37:34.294
Do not let Vostok leave
with that thermal core.

37:37.665 --> 37:39.498
Get the hell out of here!

37:39.500 --> 37:40.565
What are you waiting for?

37:40.567 --> 37:41.801
Go, go!

37:57.449 --> 37:59.951
Now might be a good time
to send in reinforcements.

37:59.953 --> 38:02.120
Mick and Stein just got
pinched by the Russkies.

38:02.122 --> 38:03.988
You're gonna have to get
out of there right now.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.090
They're hanging us out to
dry, Rip I need backup.

38:06.092 --> 38:08.026
I'm afraid our only option is retreat.

38:08.028 --> 38:09.527
What about my partner?

38:09.529 --> 38:11.128
Well, until we devise our next move,

38:11.130 --> 38:12.996
Mr. Rory will have to fend for himself.

38:12.998 --> 38:14.364
Remember the mission.

38:14.366 --> 38:16.033
If the Soviets get that thermal core back,

38:16.035 --> 38:18.302
your partner will not
be the only one who dies.

38:35.785 --> 38:37.486
You better kill me now.

38:37.488 --> 38:39.455
If I ever get my hands on you,

38:39.457 --> 38:41.623
I'm gonna get all "Rocky IV" on your ass.

38:46.562 --> 38:48.163
I'm gonna remember that, comrade.

38:52.501 --> 38:53.902
We must leave now, Colonel.

38:53.904 --> 38:55.303
There's still one more intruder,

38:55.305 --> 38:56.637
and he has the thermal core.

38:56.639 --> 38:58.139
We don't need it now.

38:58.141 --> 39:01.309
We have something far better.

39:09.918 --> 39:11.218
Ugh,

39:11.220 --> 39:13.187
thank God you managed to grab it.

39:13.189 --> 39:15.722
Where was my backup, Captain?

39:15.724 --> 39:17.724
Half the team is gone...

39:18.927 --> 39:20.726
Because of you.

39:20.728 --> 39:22.862
Only if I'd have sent the
other half in to save them,

39:22.864 --> 39:25.631
they'd be captured too,
and where would we be,

39:25.633 --> 39:27.033
hmm?

39:27.035 --> 39:28.734
Savage would have both halves of Firestorm,

39:28.736 --> 39:30.904
a dead Kendra on top of a dead Carter,

39:30.906 --> 39:33.539
everything he wants.

39:33.541 --> 39:35.375
It would be the end to our little crusade,

39:35.377 --> 39:36.474
and, most likely, the world.

39:36.476 --> 39:40.545
So before you pull that trigger,

39:40.547 --> 39:43.248
ask yourself

39:43.250 --> 39:45.017
what would you have done?

39:48.388 --> 39:52.190
That is a pretty cold calculation, Rip.

39:52.192 --> 39:54.458
Almost criminal,

39:54.460 --> 39:57.295
except we criminals have a code

39:57.297 --> 39:59.096
"You never leave one of your own behind."

39:59.098 --> 40:02.900
We will get them back.

40:02.902 --> 40:05.769
Now, if Savage even hopes
to create a Firestorm,

40:05.771 --> 40:09.673
first, he's going to
need a new one of these.

40:09.675 --> 40:10.673
A thermal core?

40:10.675 --> 40:12.142
Let me get this straight.

40:12.144 --> 40:15.111
You had Kendra and I
training for the next mission,

40:15.113 --> 40:16.947
when we should have been
out there helping them.

40:16.949 --> 40:19.615
We will help them, and our next mission

40:19.617 --> 40:21.651
is to get our compatriots back from Vostok.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.553
Who is to say they're not already dead?

40:23.555 --> 40:24.921
Vostok needs the professor alive

40:24.923 --> 40:26.423
in order to rebuild the thermal core.

40:26.425 --> 40:27.489
And Ray and Rory?

40:27.491 --> 40:28.824
Savage will keep them alive too.

40:28.826 --> 40:30.492
As leverage.

40:30.494 --> 40:32.962
He'll torture them if
Stein tries to hold out.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.763
Well, we'll have to pray that he does.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.433
If Savage's goal is to
create his own Firestorm,

40:37.435 --> 40:40.702
then Stein himself is the key,
the missing piece of the puzzle.

40:40.704 --> 40:42.904
And if Vostok figures out
how to turn Stein's powers

40:42.906 --> 40:45.106
against us, then...

40:48.677 --> 40:50.911
I'm afraid the world is beyond saving.

40:50.913 --> 40:53.147
Stein's a lot tougher than he looks.

40:53.149 --> 40:55.616
I mean, it will take a lot to break him.

40:55.618 --> 40:57.986
That's the good news.

40:57.988 --> 40:59.354
The bad news

40:59.356 --> 41:01.955
is that our compatriots
are being held

41:01.957 --> 41:05.293
in an impenetrable Soviet gulag.

41:10.465 --> 41:12.665
Get a good night's sleep.

41:12.667 --> 41:14.968
You and Dr. Vostok have much work to do

41:14.970 --> 41:16.103
in the morning.

41:16.105 --> 41:19.205
My companions from the lab...

41:19.207 --> 41:21.340
what did you do with them?

41:21.342 --> 41:22.708
Don't worry.

41:22.710 --> 41:24.776
They're alive.

41:24.778 --> 41:27.346
Whether they remain that way

41:27.348 --> 41:31.950
is entirely up to you, Professor.
