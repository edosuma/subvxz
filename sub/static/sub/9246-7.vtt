Carlton! Michael's out front

00:03.742 --> 00:05.527
and you're gonna be late
for work again.

00:05.614 --> 00:06.484
[Carlton]
'Poke your head out the door
and tell him'

00:06.571 --> 00:07.485
'I'll be there in a minute.'

00:07.572 --> 00:08.878
If I poke anything anywhere

00:08.965 --> 00:12.273
it's gonna be my house
slipper up your behind.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.710
[doorbell rings]
Tomorrow, I'm waking
that boy up

00:14.797 --> 00:17.147
with kerosene and
a box of matches.

00:18.714 --> 00:21.760
- Hey, Michael.
- Hey, Nana.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.675
Let me get you
a cup of tea, baby.

00:23.762 --> 00:26.461
No, what I'd really like is for
Carl to stop using my car horn

00:26.548 --> 00:28.637
as his snooze alarm.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.205
It's like tryin' to rouse
the dead this mornin'.

00:31.292 --> 00:36.253
Had to pull his covers down and
snap a wet towel at his behind.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.603
Truth be told, he woke up
when I pulled down the covers

00:38.690 --> 00:42.216
but I had to make it fun for me.

00:42.303 --> 00:43.869
Boy, he's really
been burnin' the candle

00:43.956 --> 00:45.306
at both ends lately, huh?

00:45.393 --> 00:48.178
Walked in my door at
3 o'clock this mornin'

00:48.265 --> 00:50.050
with the devil's grin
on his face

00:50.137 --> 00:52.052
and stripper glitter
in his teeth.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.403
Hey, man,
I'm almost ready.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.448
I just need a couple of
more minutes to moisturize.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.233
Better not be usin'
my good face cream

00:59.320 --> 01:01.931
on 'em ashy elbows of yours.

01:02.018 --> 01:03.280
I'll stop usin' your face cream

01:03.367 --> 01:04.586
when you stop
ruinin' my good razor

01:04.673 --> 01:07.502
on them wiry-ass chin whiskers.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.547
What did I tell you about
mentionin' my chin whiskers

01:09.634 --> 01:11.636
in front of company?

01:11.723 --> 01:14.117
It's really just the one,
but I ain't gonna lie

01:14.204 --> 01:17.512
you could tow a boat
with that thing.

01:17.599 --> 01:19.731
Your secret's safe with me.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.342
Michael, can I
ask you somethin'?

01:21.429 --> 01:24.388
No, I cannot see it from here.

01:24.475 --> 01:25.563
Thank you, baby.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.087
But what I was wonderin' is

01:27.174 --> 01:29.959
if you know any girls
you can introduce Carlton to.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.352
I don't think
Carl's really lookin'

01:31.439 --> 01:32.875
for anything
serious right now.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.529
He's still kind of
sowin' his wild oats.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.531
Well, if he keeps
carryin' on the way he is

01:36.618 --> 01:38.359
I'm gonna be sewin' him
into his bedsheets

01:38.446 --> 01:41.666
and beatin' him
with a bag of oranges.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.538
You know what?
I'll keep my eyes open.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.975
Alright, if the two of you
can wrap up the chitchat

01:46.062 --> 01:47.933
then maybe I won't be
late for work.

01:50.153 --> 01:53.417
If I killed him, you'd give me
a head start, wouldn't you?

Mmm.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.440
Man, I really appreciate
you drivin' today.

02:16.527 --> 02:19.530
Happy to do it. Is this the
farthest the seat goes back?

02:19.617 --> 02:21.010
The problem ain't
how far it goes back

02:21.097 --> 02:23.926
it's how far
you go forward.

02:24.013 --> 02:28.148
[sighs]
Every time I turn the wheel,
my shirt comes untucked.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.193
I can drive if you want me to.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.239
Ah, relax. You look beat.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.458
I did party
pretty late last night.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.634
And one of the dancers and I
made a real connection.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.723
"Connection," like her
hair extensions got caught

02:38.810 --> 02:40.682
in your zipper "Connection?"

02:41.683 --> 02:43.685
Hey, don't make it dirty.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.382
No, this was a spiritual thing.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.210
You know, she gave me
a three-song lap dance

02:47.297 --> 02:48.777
but only charged me for two.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.693
You sure she just
wasn't bad at math?

02:51.780 --> 02:53.347
Well, that was my first thought
too but then I saw her

02:53.434 --> 02:54.696
adding her tips up
at the end of the night.

02:54.783 --> 02:57.177
Pssh! Girl was like
rain man in a G-string.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.397
Tell me, Carl..

03:00.484 --> 03:02.094
you ever feel like
maybe you're wasting

03:02.182 --> 03:07.274
your naturally loving nature on,
shall we say, skanks?

03:07.361 --> 03:08.884
Ah, I see.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.973
Just because a woman takes
money to shake her naked butt

03:11.060 --> 03:12.496
in your face,
that makes her a skank?

03:12.583 --> 03:15.195
Well, it is one
of the warning signs.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.631
I just think you deserve better.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.589
What about a nice girl
from your church?

03:18.676 --> 03:21.331
I already tried hooking up with
them two-faced Baptist women.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.941
They'll rock your world
on Saturday night.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.378
Come Sunday mornin',
they're repentin' their sins

03:24.465 --> 03:25.596
in front of
the whole congregation.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.991
And them bitches name names.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.263
Hey, remind me to order
a tuna melt for Molly

03:40.350 --> 03:41.873
so I can drop it off
for her at work.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.527
Ah, that's thoughtful.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.399
You see, Carl, it's
important in a relationship

03:45.486 --> 03:47.966
to go the extra mile for your
lady. Make 'em feel special.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.011
Let them know
you're thinkin' about them.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.534
Yeah, surprise 'em a little.

03:50.621 --> 03:51.883
It's not
that much of a surprise.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.364
She told me to do it
this mornin'.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.499
Whoa, man.

03:58.586 --> 03:59.804
'Where'd she come from?'

03:59.891 --> 04:01.502
There's not a hospital
around here.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.678
A lab coat doesn't
necessarily mean doctor.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.288
They wear 'em behind
the makeup counter at the mall

04:05.375 --> 04:08.683
and in some of your
fancier candy stores.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.641
No, no, she's carryin'
a tiny flashlight in her pocket

04:10.728 --> 04:13.035
which means either
optometrist or proctologist.

04:13.122 --> 04:16.995
Well, heads or tails.
Either way, you win, right?

04:17.082 --> 04:18.301
Why don't you go talk to her?

04:18.388 --> 04:20.260
Oh, she ain't my type.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.827
What do you mean? She's a
beautiful, professional woman.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.742
Age-appropriate. Doesn't
have a ring on her finger.

04:24.829 --> 04:27.484
Exactly.
I'm thinkin' damaged goods.

04:27.571 --> 04:28.877
Either divorced
with a bunch of cats

04:28.964 --> 04:31.706
or one of them legs
is aluminum.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.229
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

04:33.316 --> 04:34.622
Man, I ain't going over there
and kicking that woman

04:34.709 --> 04:36.145
in the leg.

04:38.321 --> 04:41.106
Hey, Samuel. You see that woman
in the lab coat over there?

04:41.193 --> 04:42.586
- What do you know about her?
- Well, not much.

04:42.673 --> 04:45.328
Uh, her name is Christina.
Mid-30s. Optometrist.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.112
Moved here three months ago
from Michigan.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.375
She works down the street.

04:48.462 --> 04:49.506
Orders lunch from here every day

04:49.593 --> 04:51.029
and picks it up at 12:45.

04:51.116 --> 04:53.205
Usually a chicken sandwich
on wheat with light mayo.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.772
She will sometimes
order pie for dessert

04:54.859 --> 04:59.647
unless she had dessert the night
before, and then no pie.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.953
Alright. Do you know if she's
married or has a boyfriend?

05:02.040 --> 05:04.739
She's currently unattached
and not interested in dating.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.044
At least not a certain
Senegalese waiter

05:06.131 --> 05:07.611
who gave her free pickle
spears for a month

05:07.698 --> 05:09.134
and bought a pair of
$300 reading glasses

05:09.221 --> 05:11.659
that he doesn't even need.

05:13.356 --> 05:15.358
May I take your order?

05:15.445 --> 05:17.926
[instrumental music]

05:18.013 --> 05:19.449
Look, just because
she turned Samuel down

05:19.536 --> 05:21.190
doesn't mean she's
gonna turn you down.

05:21.277 --> 05:24.062
We'll just go by her work, you
walk in and introduce yourself.

05:24.149 --> 05:26.456
And then what? Pretend I need
glasses like Samuel did?

05:26.543 --> 05:27.892
Please, he ended up
not gettin' a date

05:27.979 --> 05:31.679
and lookin' like
African Urkel.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.898
Well, at least he doesn't walk
up to strange women in bars

05:33.985 --> 05:38.033
and tell them they're under
arrest for disturbin' the pants.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.383
Why are you so interested in
my love life all of a sudden?

05:40.470 --> 05:42.646
I just think the right woman
is out there for you, Carl

05:42.733 --> 05:44.039
but she's not
hangin' from a pole

05:44.126 --> 05:46.171
or liftin' her shirt
in a Bears game.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.173
Hey, your bachelor days
may be dead and buried

05:48.260 --> 05:49.653
but don't grab me with
your zombie hand

05:49.740 --> 05:51.089
and drag me into
your sad-ass grave.

05:51.176 --> 05:52.613
Hey, Molly,
how you doin', cutie?

05:52.700 --> 05:55.442
Hey, Carl.
Where's the grub, bub? Oh.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.661
Ah, there's a two-lip
delivery charge.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.533
Outrageous.
I thought it was included.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.578
Curly fries are
gettin' cold, ma'am.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.276
You drive
a hard bargain, officer.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.235
- Thanks for doing this.
- My pleasure.

[Molly]
'I could've grabbed something
from the cafeteria'

06:07.758 --> 06:09.586
but then I wouldn't get
to see your cute face.

06:09.673 --> 06:12.284
No, you work so hard, and I
really like taking care of you.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.286
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.333
You'd have about six more curly
fries, I can tell you that.

06:17.420 --> 06:21.206
Ah, only six.
You are a strong, strong man.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.034
I better get back in there
before they start huffing

06:23.121 --> 06:24.688
the permanent markers.
Love you.

06:24.775 --> 06:27.169
- I love you too.
- Bye, Carl.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.653
Alright, go ahead.
Take your best shot.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.307
My bachelor days are done, and
I'm just a love-struck loser

06:35.395 --> 06:38.485
with nothin' but a lifetime
of this to look forward to.

06:38.572 --> 06:39.921
Quit rubbin' it in, man.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.966
What you have is beautiful.

06:44.534 --> 06:47.407
I've got two women in my life.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.408
[instrumental music]

06:50.018 --> 06:52.324
Remember, you don't need
to come on too strong.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.456
This is just a meet and greet.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.327
A get to know Carl McMillan.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.286
I shouldn't be meetin'
a woman right now.

06:57.373 --> 06:58.983
My eyes are puffy,
my nails are ragged

06:59.070 --> 07:01.638
and I'm not wearing
my sharpshooter medal.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.684
Listen, this is not about
medals or braggin' about

07:03.771 --> 07:05.381
how many marine
push-ups you can do.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.775
Yeah, 86.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.690
Impressive, but irrelevant.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.735
Those are the kind
you clap in the middle.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.694
I know, but you're
not here to show off.

07:13.781 --> 07:15.739
You just want to give her
a little peek of what's in here

07:15.826 --> 07:18.916
without too much
coming out of here.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.570
So, keep it mysterious
is what you're sayin'.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.920
Yes, mysteriously
non-talkative.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.966
Yeah, al-alright.
What's our cover?

07:25.053 --> 07:26.750
Your eyes are fine,
but your partner's

07:26.837 --> 07:28.404
havin' trouble
drivin' at night.

07:28.491 --> 07:32.147
Oh, I get it. The old "Partner
can't see at night" routine.

07:32.234 --> 07:33.757
Exactly.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.455
And, uh, you're such
a good friend you insisted

07:35.542 --> 07:36.978
that I come here and
get my eyes checked.

07:37.065 --> 07:39.807
- Okay, uh, then what?
- Then you talk to her.

07:39.894 --> 07:42.549
But not too much.
Focus on listenin'.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.028
Well, is that it?

07:44.115 --> 07:46.161
'Cause that's pretty thin
and drastically unsexy.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.946
- We're not shootin' for sexy.
- Then bull's-eye.

07:53.516 --> 07:54.996
Oh, man, this would
be so much easier

07:55.083 --> 07:56.214
if she was a proctologist.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.607
What are you talking about?

07:57.694 --> 07:59.348
That way, she couldn't
see the fear in my eyes.

07:59.435 --> 08:02.786
Well, I think proctologists
can sense fear too.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.571
Look, just take a deep breath
and try not to talk

08:04.658 --> 08:06.921
unless absolutely necessary.
Hey.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.271
Oh. Good afternoon, officers.
How can I help you?

08:09.358 --> 08:10.533
Yeah, I've been
having a little trouble

08:10.620 --> 08:12.274
with night vision
and my partner

08:12.361 --> 08:14.929
and very good friend, Carl,
is worried about me drivin'.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.408
The other night I had to
grab the wheel to keep him

08:16.496 --> 08:18.367
from mowin' down three
old ladies and a baby duck.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.153
Oh, my God.
That's horrible.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.112
Well, the old ladies are fine,
but I'm still not ready

08:24.199 --> 08:26.157
to talk about the baby duck.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.772
- Carl.
- Sorry.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.251
Anyway, he insisted
that I march

08:33.338 --> 08:35.123
right in here and
get an eye exam.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.473
Well, I'm pretty booked up
for the rest of the day.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.563
- Can you come back tomorrow?
- Yes. What time do you open?

08:40.650 --> 08:42.739
It doesn't have to be
first thing in the mornin'.

08:42.826 --> 08:43.914
Uh, this area is
part of our beat.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.133
So, anytime is fine with us.

08:45.220 --> 08:46.438
Well, let me see what we have.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.918
And-and just so you know,
the two of us

08:48.005 --> 08:49.703
keep a very close eye
on this neighborhood.

08:49.790 --> 08:52.009
Unless it's at night,
then it's all on me.

08:54.403 --> 08:58.581
I can see some stuff.
I'm not completely blind.

08:58.668 --> 08:59.930
Anyway, uh, here's our card.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.715
Just call me
when somethin' opens up.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.368
Uh, Carl, why don't you
write down your cell number

09:03.455 --> 09:05.109
in case she needs
to reach us directly?

09:05.196 --> 09:08.373
That's a great idea.
Uh, call me anytime.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.462
If it goes to voice mail, I'm
probably in the middle of a car

09:10.550 --> 09:13.248
chase or a shootout.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.163
And don't assume there's
anything weird about this.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.468
We give this kind of
personal attention

09:16.556 --> 09:18.166
to all the businesses
around here.

09:18.253 --> 09:20.081
Oh, huh, good
'cause I was thinkin'

09:20.168 --> 09:22.083
this is either the worst
shakedown of all time

09:22.170 --> 09:23.475
or you guys are hittin' on me.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.955
[both laughing]

09:25.042 --> 09:26.870
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.132
But suppose one of us
was checkin'

09:28.219 --> 09:29.786
the temperature of the water.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.921
Well, you would find
that water very tepid.

09:34.008 --> 09:36.184
- Oh, really?
- Tepid's not good, Carl.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.057
I'm sorry.
I'm just not interested.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.972
Oh. Alright.
I understand.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.018
You're an independent,
educated woman and I'm just

09:44.105 --> 09:45.802
a dumb beat cop with just
two years of junior college.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.064
Oh, no, that's not
what I'm saying.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.936
You don't have to say anything.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.590
I can see it by the way you're
lookin' down your nose at me.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.461
- Carl, let it go.
- No!

09:52.548 --> 09:54.289
I've been holdin' my tongue
ever since we walked in here.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.944
I know you think that's true,
and that's your biggest problem.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.077
Guys, I-I don't
have time for this.

10:00.164 --> 10:02.427
- I've a patient waiting for me.
- Patient?

10:02.514 --> 10:04.342
- You're not even a real doctor.
- Alright, let's go.

10:04.429 --> 10:08.520
And this ain't nothin'
but a glorified sunglass hut.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.698
If she calls the cops on us,
it's gonna be very awkward.

10:16.572 --> 10:17.399
[instrumental music]

10:17.486 --> 10:18.661
Carl, why are you so upset?

10:18.748 --> 10:20.184
You get rejected
by women all the time.

10:20.271 --> 10:23.144
At least, this one didn't
blast you with pepper spray.

10:23.231 --> 10:25.537
That fake lady doctor
embarrassed me in public.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.931
Well, luckily, it was at
an optometrist's office

10:28.018 --> 10:31.935
and none of the witnesses could
actually make a positive ID.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.503
This is all just a big joke
to you, isn't it?

10:34.590 --> 10:36.026
Tellin' me to wear
my heart on my sleeve

10:36.113 --> 10:37.637
and then laughin'
when she cuts off my arm.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.161
- And beats me with it.
- Is that what you heard?

10:40.248 --> 10:42.816
Because to me, it was just
a polite no from a busy woman.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.861
My mistake was lettin' you
do all the talkin' for me.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.297
Just because you got a
girlfriend, all of a sudden

10:46.384 --> 10:49.039
you think you're
the professor of love.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.475
I'm not sayin'
I know everything.

10:50.562 --> 10:51.868
It's just, of the two of us

10:51.955 --> 10:53.870
I'm the one who's in
a serious relationship.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.393
And that was just blind luck.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.352
Like when a monkey
writes a book.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.182
- Look, I know you're upset--
- I think you're jealous.

11:01.269 --> 11:03.010
Because I'm livin' the life
you always wished you had

11:03.097 --> 11:04.968
and now that you're engaged,
you ain't never gonna have it!

11:05.055 --> 11:07.014
Hey, you were the one
cryin' at the school

11:07.101 --> 11:08.319
sayin' you wanted what I got.

11:08.406 --> 11:09.799
Hey, you know
how emotional I get

11:09.886 --> 11:11.540
when I'm sleep deprived,
that's why I never watch

11:11.627 --> 11:13.498
"The Color Purple,"
unless I'm fully rested!

11:15.718 --> 11:17.720
Okay, from now on,
I'll stay out of your life.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.156
You wanna spend
every night pickin' up

11:19.243 --> 11:21.463
bar flies and cop groupies,
that's your business.

11:21.550 --> 11:24.205
And business is just fine,
thank you very much.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.510
Maybe you should
stop worryin' about me

11:25.597 --> 11:26.773
and take care of
your own affairs.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.122
What's that supposed to mean?

11:28.209 --> 11:29.863
Well, instead of
buttin' into my life

11:29.950 --> 11:31.516
maybe you should start
thinkin' about why your fiance

11:31.603 --> 11:32.866
is workin' late every night.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.345
Hey, her job is important!

11:34.432 --> 11:35.912
She's got a lot of
responsibilities!

11:35.999 --> 11:37.914
Unlike your girlfriends,
who just have to remember

11:38.001 --> 11:41.309
to Windex the pole
when they're done workin'.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.964
I'm just sayin', Molly's got
a desk and books at home.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.923
My girls, got to go
where the pole is.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.577
[instrumental music]

11:48.664 --> 11:50.927
So, how's everything
going at work, honey?

11:51.014 --> 11:54.191
Well, the funeral home
just hired a lady mortician

11:54.278 --> 11:56.498
and I think she might be
kind of sweet on me.

11:56.585 --> 11:59.414
You sure she's not just being
overly nice on her first day?

11:59.501 --> 12:02.025
I made the same assumption
about the new Sparkletts gal.

12:02.112 --> 12:04.114
Is that why we have to pick up
the bottles at the curb?

12:04.201 --> 12:07.422
[scoffs]
Yeah, apparently,
she greets everyone with

12:07.509 --> 12:10.077
"Mind if I grab your jugs?"

12:13.471 --> 12:15.865
Ah, there he is.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.215
- How was your day?
- Don't ask.

12:18.302 --> 12:21.088
Carl was a bigger pain
in the ass than usual today.

12:21.175 --> 12:25.396
He's like a hemorrhoid
with a badge.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.963
- Where's Molly?
- No, not here.

12:27.050 --> 12:30.184
- Must be working late.
- Again? Damn it!

12:30.271 --> 12:32.403
Look, I understand she wants
this vice principal job

12:32.490 --> 12:34.884
and that means putting in some
extra hours and nobody has been

12:34.971 --> 12:37.191
more supportive of that
than me, right? Am I right?

12:37.278 --> 12:40.020
- Absolutely, very supportive.
- Right. Absolutely.

12:40.107 --> 12:42.413
And I understand that
in a mature relationship

12:42.500 --> 12:44.981
you have to be flexible,
this is not me still wishin'

12:45.068 --> 12:48.332
I was single or being jealous of
any other knucklehead that is!

12:48.419 --> 12:50.595
- Didn't even go there.
- Of course, not.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.597
I mean, come on, Molly and I
are still in the early throes

12:52.684 --> 12:55.383
of love and we never spend
any time together anymore!

12:55.470 --> 12:57.646
- We love your company.
- Aw, that's horrible.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.430
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna pack up a picnic.

12:59.517 --> 13:01.824
And surprise her at work.
I'm not giving up on romance.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.173
I'll show her we still got it.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.696
No matter
what anybody else says!

13:04.784 --> 13:06.568
- I didn't say anything.
- Wouldn't dare.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.439
Now, if you ladies are done,
I'm gonna take the rest

13:08.526 --> 13:10.659
of this food and turn it into
a magical dinner for two!

13:10.746 --> 13:13.140
- All yours!
- Pack it up, Romeo.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.142
[instrumental music]

13:15.229 --> 13:17.492
Carlton, why aren't
you at the strip club?

13:17.579 --> 13:19.494
You better get movin'
before all the other perverts

13:19.581 --> 13:22.584
get the ringside seats.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.107
I'm not goin' out tonight,
I'm just gonna, uh

13:24.194 --> 13:25.805
watch a little TV and go to bed.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.632
Well, if you don't show up,
how are them poor girls

13:27.719 --> 13:31.027
gonna pay their rent
or buy their narcotics?

13:32.855 --> 13:35.597
Leave me alone, grandma, just
go to your Bible study class.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.338
I can get there
a little bit late.

13:37.425 --> 13:39.993
We're studying Deuteronomy,
and all them "Shalt nots"

13:40.080 --> 13:42.430
put a damper on
the drinkin' and trash talkin'.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.521
What's troubling you?

13:47.739 --> 13:48.958
[sighs]

13:51.526 --> 13:53.310
Do you think I'm ever
gonna find a nice girl?

13:53.397 --> 13:55.312
You know, somebody I can
really settle down with.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.836
You could if you tried.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.315
But you can't
shake the whore tree

13:58.402 --> 14:01.231
and expect
an angel to fall out.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.060
I just don't feel like
a really good woman

14:04.147 --> 14:05.714
would go for a guy like me.

14:05.801 --> 14:08.238
Why not? You're a fine,
decent, good-lookin' boy

14:08.325 --> 14:10.110
with a big, lovin' heart.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.763
You're my grandma,
you have to say that.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.722
I don't have to say anything.

14:13.809 --> 14:15.811
And I ain't blind to your flaws.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.205
Many a time, I had to use
one hand to pull the other one

14:18.292 --> 14:20.294
away from your throat.

14:22.644 --> 14:25.212
But I didn't raise you to be
thinkin' you're not good enough.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.778
Because you are.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.998
And if you found
the right girl

14:29.085 --> 14:32.132
and showed her
the man I see everyday

14:32.219 --> 14:34.047
you'd have yet another
good woman in your life

14:34.134 --> 14:36.397
who loves you
for who you are.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.789
- Thanks, grandma.
- Hmm-hmm.

14:37.877 --> 14:38.878
I love you too.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.880
[chuckling]

14:42.533 --> 14:44.840
But when you do find a girl

14:44.927 --> 14:46.886
don't think you got to share
everything about yourself

14:46.973 --> 14:49.932
all at once.

14:50.019 --> 14:52.979
Let her make peace with
your leopard skin man thong

14:53.066 --> 14:57.374
before you start stealin'
her lady lotions.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.899
That reminds me,
I used all your cocoa butter.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.944
Get out of my house.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.642
[instrumental music]

15:04.729 --> 15:05.948
Hey, teach.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.428
Honey, what are you doing here?

15:07.515 --> 15:08.820
Well, you missed dinner,
so, I thought

15:08.908 --> 15:10.735
I'd surprise you
with a little picnic.

15:10.822 --> 15:13.521
Oh, my God, I completely
lost track of the time.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.524
We can have some food, perhaps
a little splash of vino.

15:16.611 --> 15:17.786
Oh, actually, we're
not allowed to have

15:17.873 --> 15:19.570
alcohol on the school premises.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.616
Right, like none of you teachers
keep a bottle of hooch

15:21.703 --> 15:25.054
hidden in your desk or
inside the guinea pig cage.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.143
You'd probably find some
wild turkey in the wood shop

15:27.230 --> 15:30.277
but that guy
loses a finger a year.

15:30.364 --> 15:33.454
Alright, well, we can still
enjoy a nice dinner together.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.804
And maybe for dessert,
something sweet and naughty

15:35.891 --> 15:37.110
in the teachers' lounge.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.981
Oh, I don't know.
It'd be weird.

15:39.068 --> 15:43.420
I have sex in there all
the time with the janitor.

15:43.507 --> 15:47.076
I'm kidding. I'm kidding!

15:47.163 --> 15:49.426
I just don't think
it'd be a good idea.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.428
Okay. I shouldn't have
dropped in unannounced.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.343
I was trying to be
spontaneous and romantic

15:53.430 --> 15:54.954
and now I just feel stupid.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.782
No, no, come on.
It's so sweet.

15:57.869 --> 16:00.742
Showing up here with
a little picnic basket.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.048
You know how many times
your mom and sister said

16:02.135 --> 16:05.094
"Hey, where you going, Yogi?"

16:05.181 --> 16:07.053
- A lot?
- Three times at the house.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.838
And once in a text message.

16:09.925 --> 16:13.189
Look, I-I know I've been
putting in tons of extra hours

16:13.276 --> 16:15.235
and I really appreciate
your patience.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.801
It's just, I never get
to see you anymore.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.586
I got nobody to gripe
about my day to

16:18.673 --> 16:20.022
except your mom
and your sister.

16:20.109 --> 16:22.024
Yeah, they're not very
good listeners, are they?

16:22.111 --> 16:24.679
The worst. It's like talkin'
to a bottle of wine and a bong.

16:24.766 --> 16:27.073
[chuckles]

16:27.160 --> 16:28.378
You'd think one of them
would know how to say

16:28.465 --> 16:29.684
"It's gonna be
alright, sweetie."

16:29.771 --> 16:31.512
It is gonna be
alright, sweetie.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.383
See, you don't even know
what I'm talkin' about

16:33.470 --> 16:35.951
and you made me feel better.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.431
I'm gonna make it up to you.

16:37.518 --> 16:41.217
Tomorrow night, romantic
evening, just you and me.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.523
You don't have to do that.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.655
Hey, I want to.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.441
Missing goes both ways, buddy.

16:52.489 --> 16:56.319
Hey, you know what?

16:56.406 --> 16:57.842
I can take a little break.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.670
Crack this picnic basket open.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.411
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.805
I need a little fiance time.

17:03.892 --> 17:08.679
You know what?
Open that bottle of wine.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.246
But what if somebody walks in?

17:10.333 --> 17:12.683
I'll just tell them
it's yours, Yogi.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.078
Whatever you say, Boo-Boo.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.473
[instrumental music]

17:23.999 --> 17:26.567
Hey. Remember me?

17:26.654 --> 17:29.439
You kind of look like this
crazy cop that came by earlier

17:29.526 --> 17:31.789
but, uh, I can't imagine him
showing his face again.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.356
[chuckles]

17:33.443 --> 17:35.619
Yeah, look..

17:35.706 --> 17:37.099
...about that.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.059
I'm sorry for the way
that went down.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.799
I wasn't trying to be mean.

17:41.886 --> 17:43.888
I'm just not interested
in dating anyone right now.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.673
I understand, and I'm not
here to press the issue.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.240
I just wanted a chance
to explain myself.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.633
You don't owe me
any explanations.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.635
Although, an apology for
that "Not a doctor" comment

17:51.722 --> 17:53.724
might be in order.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.900
Yeah, that was
my bruised ego talkin'.

17:55.987 --> 17:56.945
[scoffs]

17:58.512 --> 18:00.253
[sighs]

18:00.340 --> 18:03.082
I get intimidated by
women of your caliber.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.388
- My caliber?
- Yeah.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.477
You're beautiful,
smart, successful

18:07.564 --> 18:09.000
and can see right
through a guy like me.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.133
[scoffs]
Hey, it's your life.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.179
If you wanna be a player,
that's your business.

18:13.266 --> 18:14.658
I just don't have time for that.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.747
See, here's the thing,
I-I'm not really a player.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.837
I mean, I am, but I'm
not really good at it.

18:21.839 --> 18:24.407
- Are you playing me right now?
- No.

18:24.494 --> 18:26.496
Unless it's workin' for you.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.848
Look, I'm sure
you're a nice guy.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.850
But I already live
with a nice guy.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.418
- Oh.
- And he's six years old.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.028
- You have a kid?
- Yeah.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.508
So, if you want to turn and run

18:38.595 --> 18:40.945
the exit to the sunglass hut
is right there.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.689
- You kiddin' me? I love kids.
- Really?

18:45.776 --> 18:48.475
Yeah. I mean, I don't have any
of my own, but I used to be one.

18:48.562 --> 18:49.780
My grandma says I still am.

18:49.867 --> 18:50.999
By the way, I live
with my grandma.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.566
- You're kidding.
- No.

18:52.653 --> 18:55.003
I should probably stop talking
right about now.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.571
No, no, keep going, I'm starting
to see you're really not much

18:57.658 --> 18:59.921
of a player at all.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.792
Oh, no, what you saw
was just a handsome facade.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.272
I'm really a mess inside.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.708
Yeah, no matter
how many medals I've won

19:04.795 --> 19:06.319
or how many marine
push-ups I can do.

19:06.406 --> 19:09.452
It's 86, by the way.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.150
Those are the kind that
you clap in the middle.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.934
I'm serious, I can do those.

19:13.021 --> 19:15.371
I'm sure you can.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.025
I can't believe
I thought you were stuck-up

19:17.112 --> 19:18.896
when I first saw you.

19:18.983 --> 19:22.073
- Where did you first see me?
- At the diner.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.336
Oh.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.164
[instrumental music]

19:32.910 --> 19:35.261
So, it turns out the lady
mortician is a lesbian.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.480
But I'm apparently
not her type.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.265
How'd you find that out?

19:39.352 --> 19:42.659
I asked her if she was
a lesbian and she said, "Yes."

19:42.746 --> 19:46.315
Then I asked her if I was
her type and she said, "No."

19:48.404 --> 19:49.927
Hey, big boy.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.973
Your fiance's upstairs.

19:52.060 --> 19:56.934
And we were told to deliver
this message to you personally.

19:57.021 --> 20:00.286
"Now, serving dessert
in the teacher's lounge."

20:01.852 --> 20:04.638
- She means the bedroom.
- But we didn't read it.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.074
Unh-unh, unh-unh.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.382
Excuse me, ladies.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.166
[soft music]

20:51.075 --> 20:52.773
I love you, Molly Flynn.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.122
[snores]

21:04.872 --> 21:06.177
[theme music]
