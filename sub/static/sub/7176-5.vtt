WEBVTT

01:09.319 --> 01:11.028
Tell me about Paris.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.031
Again?
Please.

01:16.535 --> 01:17.827
I only went there once.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.829
Continue.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.582
I was visiting
a monastery

01:22.666 --> 01:24.542
in Frankia,
outside of Paris.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.462
And one day,
the monks took me
to see it.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.340
It was amazing.

01:31.425 --> 01:36.220
It just appears
as if it rises out
of the water.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.682
I've never in
my whole life seen
anything like it.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.392
It was like a dream.

01:41.476 --> 01:44.854
It has these huge walls,
and inside the walls

01:44.938 --> 01:47.773
are these buildings
made of marble
and stone,

01:47.858 --> 01:50.401
and churches,
such churches.

01:51.195 --> 01:54.530
I remember the clamor
of their bells, calling
the faithful to prayer.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.702
But what I
remember more

02:00.370 --> 02:02.246
is the beautiful women.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.374
You never told me
that part before.

02:05.709 --> 02:06.959
I almost

02:08.629 --> 02:11.505
questioned my vows
of celibacy.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.182
What are they
talking about?

02:21.266 --> 02:22.558
Who?

02:22.643 --> 02:25.561
Ragnar and
that priest.

02:27.522 --> 02:28.981
Look at them,

02:29.900 --> 02:31.192
huddled together.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.528
It sickens me!

02:35.656 --> 02:37.156
Don't worry about it.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.077
Someone has to
worry about it, Rollo,

02:43.914 --> 02:45.373
even if it's only me.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.549
You are lucky.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.343
Why?

02:57.427 --> 02:59.470
Because you have
never been married.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.557
I would not
come back here

03:04.268 --> 03:06.519
if it weren't
for my children.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.106
At least you
have children.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.448
Porunn.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.285
What is it, Bjorn?

03:23.287 --> 03:24.912
Are you thirsty?

03:25.706 --> 03:26.789
No.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.084
I am not thirsty,

03:30.168 --> 03:32.086
or hungry,

03:32.170 --> 03:34.046
or really alive.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.580
Who were you
hoping to see?

04:07.664 --> 04:09.040
Torstein.
Torstein.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.417
Both of you?

04:16.006 --> 04:17.965
Torstein is in Valhalla.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.068
She will be all right.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.960
Take her.

04:59.508 --> 05:00.966
Where are my sons?

05:01.051 --> 05:02.051
Siggy!

05:02.135 --> 05:04.220
I have something
to tell you.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.014
Siggy! Siggy!

05:07.099 --> 05:08.599
I said, where
are my sons?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.184
Siggy!

05:12.354 --> 05:13.646
Rollo. Rollo...

05:13.730 --> 05:15.523
Where is Siggy?
I can't find her.
Rollo! Rollo...

05:15.607 --> 05:17.108
Siggy is dead.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.572
How?

05:25.992 --> 05:28.661
Ubbe and Hvitserk
fell through the ice
into a frozen lake.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.082
Siggy saved their lives,
but she drowned.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.460
And we could not
find the body.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.671
The gods are mistaken.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.090
No, the gods are
never mistaken.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.102
This is my fault.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.566
I did not treat her well.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.444
It's the truth.

06:03.447 --> 06:04.864
You all know it.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.451
This is my fault.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.967
Rollo!

06:27.888 --> 06:29.054
Rollo!

06:32.893 --> 06:35.436
Why was Siggy taking
care of our children?

06:36.563 --> 06:38.147
We were taking it
in turns.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.607
That day it just
happened to be Siggy.

06:39.691 --> 06:40.858
On another day,
it could have been me.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.776
I wasn't asking
you, Helga.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.112
I was asking you.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.073
Helga is right.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.869
We three women
took it in turn to care
for all our children.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.038
See, I find that funny

06:54.122 --> 06:55.956
considering that
Siggy's children
are dead.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.587
I must go see Porunn.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.634
What are you
hiding, Helga?

07:07.177 --> 07:08.177
Nothing.

07:09.513 --> 07:10.846
What do you mean?

07:11.848 --> 07:13.516
I can see it in your eyes.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.076
Porunn?
No! Don't come near.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.537
Porunn...
No!

07:35.997 --> 07:37.373
What is it?

07:38.542 --> 07:39.583
How can I help?

07:39.668 --> 07:42.211
I don't want any help.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.213
Please.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.758
How can you
help me with this?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.733
Rollo!

08:04.818 --> 08:06.735
Would you like
another to drink?

08:10.991 --> 08:12.241
Why not?

08:13.076 --> 08:14.451
Give him another drink.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.079
He hasn't drowned
his sorrows yet!

08:18.331 --> 08:19.498
What did you say?

08:19.582 --> 08:20.833
Listen to me.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.169
I lost one of my sons
fighting for the Christians.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.130
We have
all lost someone!

08:26.214 --> 08:29.758
Brothers,
cousins, friends.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.469
What is so special
about you?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.807
You should know better
than to mess with me!

08:37.684 --> 08:40.561
Look at him!
Look at yourself!

08:40.645 --> 08:42.771
Now if you were Ragnar,
no problem!

08:42.856 --> 08:44.273
Uncle, stop!

08:47.444 --> 08:49.611
What're you doing?
Stop! Don't be stupid!

08:49.696 --> 08:51.613
They'll kill you.
They can try.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.157
Get back!

08:54.242 --> 08:55.367
I can't let you do this.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.286
Get out of my way, Bjorn!

08:57.370 --> 08:59.121
I do not want
to kill you.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.291
If it's what the gods wish,
then so be it, huh?

09:14.929 --> 09:16.638
I'll fight you all!

09:43.333 --> 09:44.583
Finish him!

10:03.019 --> 10:04.395
Finish him!

10:04.479 --> 10:06.397
Get up!
Get up!

10:22.038 --> 10:23.330
Hit me!

10:27.085 --> 10:29.044
Hit me!

11:50.126 --> 11:53.128
Why did you leave Siggy
to look after my sons?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.091
I told you.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.807
Why did the boys walk
over a frozen lake?

12:07.977 --> 12:10.437
What do you think
made them do it?

12:11.231 --> 12:15.025
They are curious.
Just like their father.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.204
Is that all?

12:28.456 --> 12:30.457
What else can
I tell you?

13:06.077 --> 13:08.203
Don't you want
to have sex?

13:19.090 --> 13:20.465
What is it?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.970
You had so much sex in
England you don't need it?

13:29.726 --> 13:33.312
Perhaps more
of our people can go
and join the settlement.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.855
Yes.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.233
They can go
and work for a Christian king,

13:39.027 --> 13:40.694
in a Christian country.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.488
Perhaps they can also
become Christians.

13:43.740 --> 13:44.990
Why not?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.909
Whatever they choose
to do will be up to them.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.620
Who asked you, priest?

13:49.704 --> 13:51.163
Floki!
What?

13:51.914 --> 13:53.248
He is a Christian.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.459
He's always
been a Christian.

13:56.586 --> 13:59.004
I don't know why
Ragnar listens to him.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.172
It's true.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.841
I don't know why
Ragnar listens to me.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.968
Not when he can
listen to you, Floki.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.972
Good night.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.266
May the gods keep you.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.607
Bjorn!

14:19.942 --> 14:21.026
What?

14:22.320 --> 14:25.322
What do you mean "what"?
What happened to you?

14:26.616 --> 14:28.659
I got into a fight
with my uncle.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.577
You fought with Rollo?

14:30.662 --> 14:32.913
I wanted to stop
them killing him.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.499
I don't understand.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.250
It doesn't matter.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.003
Are you
going to see Porunn?

14:42.465 --> 14:45.801
No. She does not
want to see me.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.887
If she needs me,
she will tell me.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.848
She is a woman,
not a child.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.310
Good night.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.240
What are you hiding?

15:10.118 --> 15:11.993
I'm not a fool, Helga.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.331
Something happened here
when we were away.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.793
Something happened that
led to the death of Siggy.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.756
Even Ragnar knows that.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.009
But he doesn't know
what happened.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.012
And you do,

15:32.181 --> 15:33.181
don't you, Helga?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.064
A wanderer came here.

15:43.568 --> 15:47.195
We had all dreamed of him.
Aslaug, Siggy and me.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.948
He said his name
was Harbard.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.283
And he possessed
some gifts.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.035
He told stories,
and he could cure people.

15:54.537 --> 15:57.038
He cured Ivar
of his pains.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.084
His name was Harbard?
Yes.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.670
That is what he said.

16:04.714 --> 16:08.383
And what else did
he do, this Harbard?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.055
He seduced Aslaug.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.017
She slept with him.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.227
It was because of him

16:19.312 --> 16:21.480
that she was
not looking after
the children.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.483
And this...
He said his name
was Harbard?

16:24.567 --> 16:25.650
Are you sure
he said that?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.903
Yes, he said that.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.738
But what does it matter?

16:30.239 --> 16:31.823
He took Aslaug away
from the children.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.533
It was his fault
that Siggy died.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.161
No. Not his fault.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.705
Her fault, your fault,
everyone's fault.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.415
What do you mean?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.083
You frighten me.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.669
Harbard is not
a human being.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.421
Harbard is a god.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.216
He came to visit.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.177
And such a visit must
always be celebrated.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.513
Even if it
leads to death?

16:54.597 --> 16:57.682
If it leads to death,
it also leads to life.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.019
That is the way
with the gods.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.772
That is what Ragnar
must understand.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.857
But I don't want
to tell Ragnar.

17:05.942 --> 17:06.942
It is not my business
to tell Ragnar.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.693
No, no, no.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.403
No, you're right.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.490
It is my business.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.248
I must speak to Earl Ingstad!

17:21.582 --> 17:23.792
I must speak to Earl Ingstad!

17:27.046 --> 17:29.214
I must speak
to Earl Ingstad!
Inside.

17:31.968 --> 17:35.220
Earl Ingstad,
we just heard of your return.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.930
There is some news.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.391
Your properties,
your lands, your earldom,

17:39.475 --> 17:41.309
all have been usurped.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.230
Say again.
It's the truth.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.899
You have been
removed from power.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.317
Forgive me.
I am only the messenger.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.861
Who has done this?
Who has usurped me?

17:52.822 --> 17:53.905
Kalf.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.242
Kalf.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.871
That's impossible.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.290
And yet it has
happened.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.501
Kalf has made himself
the new Earl of Hedeby.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.256
I supported
you in Wessex, now you
must support me.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.925
Together we can
overthrow this usurper.

18:14.010 --> 18:17.470
Firstly, you came to Wessex
of your own volition.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.557
Secondly, if there
is a civil war,

18:21.434 --> 18:24.352
many of our own
people will die.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.772
Is your earldom really
that important to you?

18:27.857 --> 18:29.441
Yes.
Why?

18:29.525 --> 18:32.819
Because it is
rightfully mine!

18:37.742 --> 18:43.163
Well, there is never
much use in arguing
with you, Lagertha.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.041
We shall go
and talk to him.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.183
Who is Harbard?

19:09.398 --> 19:10.899
Who is Harbard?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.363
Who is Harbard?

19:23.496 --> 19:24.746
You want to know?

19:26.791 --> 19:28.917
I'll tell you
about Harbard.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.587
I'll tell you about
who he was to your son.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.924
The son you
leave behind.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.762
When you went away,
Harbard helped him.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.185
He took away
Ivar's pain.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.648
Look how
peaceful he is.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.234
He's sleeping.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.861
He never slept before.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.866
And it was Harbard
who stopped his suffering.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.797
Was he good?

20:17.508 --> 20:19.801
This Harbard?

20:27.309 --> 20:29.811
Yes, he was
a good man.

21:49.225 --> 21:50.391
Judith?

21:52.019 --> 21:53.061
Yes.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.023
What's the matter
with you, Judith, hmm?

21:58.067 --> 21:59.943
You have been like this
for many days now.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.528
Are you ill?

22:02.696 --> 22:04.489
Do you want me to call
the physician monk?

22:04.573 --> 22:05.615
No.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.995
There is nothing
he can do for
my condition.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.413
Condition?

22:13.582 --> 22:15.083
What condition?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.506
Answer me!

22:21.924 --> 22:24.175
I am your husband.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.391
I am with child.
What?

22:35.604 --> 22:37.981
I am with child.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.108
Well, that's impossible.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.610
We have not slept together
as man and wife

22:42.695 --> 22:44.612
since our son was born.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.615
You told me...
It is true.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.332
Whose child is it?
Huh?

22:58.836 --> 23:00.503
Whose child is it?

23:06.635 --> 23:08.011
Oh, my God.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.096
Oh, my God.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.184
Oh, God!

23:29.074 --> 23:30.158
Son?

23:32.369 --> 23:33.411
What is it?

23:33.829 --> 23:35.038
Nothing.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.377
Then come with me.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.924
So, this man
has just come to me.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.091
He's a farmer.

23:47.176 --> 23:50.428
He's been helping
the Northmen to establish
their settlement.

23:50.512 --> 23:53.264
Tell my son
what has happened.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.271
There has been
some trouble.

24:00.356 --> 24:03.983
Some conflict between
the Northmen and some
of the landowners.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.818
Nothing much at first.

24:05.903 --> 24:08.947
Boundary disputes.
The usual stuff
between us farmers.

24:09.031 --> 24:13.284
But then it got serious.
There were threats.
I tried to stay out of it.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.495
"Drink the wine,
praise the Lord of all,

24:15.579 --> 24:17.538
"and let the world
be the world."
That's what I say!

24:18.082 --> 24:19.874
Yes, never mind
about all that.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.043
What happened next?

24:24.838 --> 24:28.049
One of the farms
of the Northmen was
attacked and burned down.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.385
Some people died.

24:32.221 --> 24:36.224
And what did
the attackers say
to the Northmen?

24:38.727 --> 24:41.229
They said it was
just the beginning.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.440
That they would come back
and kill them all.

24:45.985 --> 24:49.028
Now you know
that this settlement,

24:49.738 --> 24:52.156
and my agreement
with Ragnar Lothbrok,

24:52.241 --> 24:54.575
mean a great deal to me.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.246
So I want someone,
someone I can trust,

24:58.998 --> 25:01.833
to go out
to the settlement
with a large force,

25:01.917 --> 25:04.419
and bring these
disputes to an end.

25:08.799 --> 25:12.260
But you have just
returned to Wessex

25:12.344 --> 25:13.594
and to your wife
and child.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.263
So, I would
understand

25:15.347 --> 25:18.349
if you did not want
to leave them
again so soon.

25:18.434 --> 25:19.517
I'll go.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.564
If you're sure?

25:25.232 --> 25:26.774
I said I'll go.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.772
Once again, Ragnar.

26:06.690 --> 26:10.151
I know, never as king.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.487
Never as King Ragnar.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.907
What does a king require
from a simple seer?

26:16.825 --> 26:18.659
There is
a city called Paris.

26:18.744 --> 26:23.081
Paris. Yes.
I have seen its gates.

26:24.958 --> 26:28.669
And I see that
its gates are already
here, to my eyes.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.172
What does that mean?

26:31.256 --> 26:33.591
It means exactly
as I have said.

26:34.468 --> 26:37.470
I do not lie about
what I see, King Ragnar,

26:37.554 --> 26:40.681
only sometimes
I withhold things,

26:40.766 --> 26:44.102
for human beings
cannot bear
too much reality.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.022
Then if you can see,

26:48.107 --> 26:50.691
tell me if I will
conquer Paris.

26:51.193 --> 26:53.694
I can see that
not the living,

26:53.779 --> 26:56.364
but the dead,
will conquer Paris.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.663
Not the living
but the dead?

27:03.747 --> 27:05.414
And I also see

27:05.499 --> 27:09.627
that the bear
will be crowned
by a princess.

27:10.212 --> 27:14.048
Which does not bode
too well for you,
King Ragnar.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.142
Ooh. Oh!

27:25.602 --> 27:27.353
Stop. I don't want
to fight you.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.030
Quiet. Quiet.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.622
I have made up my mind.

27:47.416 --> 27:50.835
And this year,
we shall attack Paris.

27:51.628 --> 27:52.920
Paris?

27:53.922 --> 27:56.174
What is Paris?

27:56.258 --> 27:58.009
That is a good
question, brother.

27:58.093 --> 28:01.053
Paris is a city in
the country of Frankia.

28:01.805 --> 28:02.930
Next!

28:03.724 --> 28:06.726
Why haven't you told us
all about this before?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.855
Because
I'm telling you now.

28:12.065 --> 28:16.444
I understand that this,
this will not be easy.

28:16.695 --> 28:20.698
By all accounts,
Paris is a huge,

28:22.117 --> 28:25.786
walled, well-protected city.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.749
This is something
that our people

28:30.042 --> 28:33.711
have never attempted
or dreamt of before.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.547
But I have begun to think

28:39.301 --> 28:40.927
and dream of it.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.061
Athelstan.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.605
Come. Come.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.192
Athelstan has
been to Paris.

28:57.194 --> 29:00.154
And the wanderer who first
told me about England,

29:00.239 --> 29:02.865
he too told me
about this city.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.409
We must find him!

29:05.494 --> 29:07.370
Yes!

29:08.163 --> 29:09.914
For it is good

29:09.998 --> 29:13.417
to travel with hope
and with courage.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.297
But it is still better

29:18.840 --> 29:20.841
to travel with knowledge!

29:33.563 --> 29:35.481
We will take this place!

29:43.699 --> 29:45.283
What about your promise?

29:45.617 --> 29:46.784
What promise?

29:46.868 --> 29:49.537
To visit my earldom.
To go to Hedeby.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.580
To speak to the usurper.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.294
Kalf!

29:59.298 --> 30:01.382
You know why we've come.

30:02.384 --> 30:05.386
You have usurped
my rights and my lands,

30:05.762 --> 30:09.015
to whom you were sworn
in fealty and trust.

30:09.725 --> 30:13.144
I expect you to hand
both land and title back.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.817
Hello, Kalf.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.486
Perhaps we might, uh,

30:22.571 --> 30:25.406
discuss these
matters privately.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.078
As you wish,
King Ragnar.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.638
Please, sit.

30:53.977 --> 30:59.023
I would prefer to
avoid the unnecessary
loss of lives

30:59.107 --> 31:01.317
fighting a civil war
with you.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.699
Do you mind if
I call you earl, Kalf?

31:09.534 --> 31:11.202
Uh-uh.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.037
Come the spring,

31:13.121 --> 31:15.956
I will be invading
a country called Frankia.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.921
And I would like
to invite you,

31:22.005 --> 31:24.131
your men
and your ships,

31:24.216 --> 31:25.716
to join me on
this expedition.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.220
And if I refuse?

31:29.805 --> 31:31.055
You will lose
everything.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.223
Even my earldom?

31:32.307 --> 31:34.058
You mean my earldom.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.309
Mmm.

31:36.645 --> 31:39.146
That is between you
and my ex-wife.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.690
And good luck
with that.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.989
Won't you sit down,
Lagertha?

31:49.658 --> 31:51.700
I know you
must hate me.

31:52.619 --> 31:55.329
Just let me say that
I was born here in Hedeby.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.457
I belong here and
I have a fierce pride
in being its earl.

32:00.669 --> 32:03.045
I have a better claim
than you do

32:03.797 --> 32:07.049
even though I share
the world's admiration
for you.

32:07.968 --> 32:11.637
I'm not sure I believe
so much in titles.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.389
A title is only
an opportunity

32:13.473 --> 32:15.850
to do good things
for the folk here.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.477
I want to do that.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.230
You betrayed me.

32:21.314 --> 32:24.608
And the fact is,
you planned to betray me.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.486
And you must have
planned it for a long time.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.490
I did, yes.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.786
Despite the fact
that I desired you.

32:37.038 --> 32:40.124
You desired me?
Yes.

32:40.208 --> 32:43.294
All the time
that I was planning
on overthrowing you,

32:43.378 --> 32:44.587
I desired you.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.548
I never stopped
desiring you.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.345
What am I supposed to do
with that knowledge?

32:59.561 --> 33:01.437
What do you
want to do?

33:11.031 --> 33:13.657
Ragnar was
always chosen over me.

33:14.284 --> 33:17.036
By my father.
And my mother.

33:18.622 --> 33:20.247
Then by Lagertha.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.126
Why would I not want
to betray him?

33:24.211 --> 33:26.128
Why would I not want
to scream at him,

33:26.213 --> 33:28.881
"You see, I am alive too!"

33:31.676 --> 33:35.971
Being alive is nothing.
It doesn't matter what I do.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.515
Ragnar is my father,
he is my mother,

33:38.600 --> 33:40.226
he is Lagertha.
He is Siggy.

33:41.436 --> 33:45.564
He is everything
I cannot do,

33:45.649 --> 33:47.566
everything I cannot be.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.778
I love him.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.197
He is my brother.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.950
He has taken me back.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.577
But I am so angry!

33:59.996 --> 34:03.707
Why am I still so angry?

34:03.792 --> 34:05.626
You tell me, wise one.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.879
Or I will tell you.

34:09.631 --> 34:12.716
It is because I am
useless, feckless,

34:12.801 --> 34:15.678
hollowed out
by failed ambitions,

34:16.596 --> 34:18.180
by failed loves.

34:22.852 --> 34:25.646
Nothing good can ever
come of my life now.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.321
What is there
to laugh about?

34:35.615 --> 34:39.952
Rollo, if you truly
knew what the gods
have in store for you,

34:40.036 --> 34:43.080
you would go down
now and dance naked
on the beach.

34:44.499 --> 34:46.250
I don't understand.

34:46.334 --> 34:48.377
I tell you,
as I told Ragnar,

34:48.461 --> 34:50.254
a bear will
marry a princess.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.090
And I can tell you
that you will be
present at the ceremony.

34:53.842 --> 34:56.302
Now go and leave me.

35:07.522 --> 35:08.856
Good. Good.

35:10.317 --> 35:11.358
Good.

35:19.743 --> 35:21.243
Kill the pagans.

35:21.328 --> 35:22.369
My Lord.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.603
Come! Come!

37:55.440 --> 37:58.442
Friends,
it was all for this.

37:59.736 --> 38:02.738
It was all for our Lord!

38:10.371 --> 38:11.413
"Our Father,

38:12.707 --> 38:14.500
"Who art in heaven,

38:15.168 --> 38:17.294
"Hallowed by thy name..."

38:22.050 --> 38:23.926
Where are you going?
I have no idea.

38:24.010 --> 38:28.263
But your father won't
fight for my honor
or my property.

38:28.348 --> 38:29.890
I cannot stay here.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.101
It seems we have
been here before.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.937
Don't try to stop me.

38:35.855 --> 38:38.482
You can leave if you like.
You are a free woman.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.027
But Ragnar has
many other sons.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.447
What are you trying
to say, Bjorn?

38:45.532 --> 38:47.241
I'm saying, if you leave

38:48.243 --> 38:49.910
and you show you do not care,
what is to stop him

38:49.994 --> 38:51.995
from favoring
his other sons?

38:52.580 --> 38:54.081
Her sons above me?

38:54.499 --> 38:55.958
Ragnar loves you.

38:56.376 --> 38:57.876
And I love him too.

38:59.671 --> 39:00.921
But I know him.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.217
So I am asking you to stay.
Not for your sake,
but for mine.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.220
But don't pretend
to me that you don't
want to go to Paris.

39:08.304 --> 39:09.513
I know you want
to go to Paris.

39:09.597 --> 39:12.683
I've dreamed
of the three of us
going together.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.685
Do you understand?

39:15.561 --> 39:18.105
Do you understand?
You're not leaving.

39:19.107 --> 39:21.108
You're a man now,
Bjorn.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.318
Act like one.

39:42.130 --> 39:45.424
There are things
you do not know
about this Harbard.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.677
About this Harbard,
and your wife.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.056
Helga told me
everything.

39:54.517 --> 39:58.103
She told me Harbard
would take Aslaug away

39:58.187 --> 40:00.647
from her children,

40:00.732 --> 40:02.649
away from your sons.

40:04.027 --> 40:06.361
They would go
off together.

40:06.446 --> 40:09.489
And they would sneak
into the fish huts and...

40:13.369 --> 40:14.745
Many times.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.374
Helga said
she smelled like fish.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.669
That's how it was.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.423
That's what happened
when you were away.

40:26.507 --> 40:29.384
Wait!
There's more, Ragnar.

40:29.469 --> 40:30.969
There's much more.

40:31.512 --> 40:34.890
Do you not know
who Harbard is?

40:34.974 --> 40:37.351
Harbard is another
name for Odin.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.686
It was Odin who slept
with your wife.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.105
The god, Odin,
who came to Kattegat.

40:53.785 --> 40:57.496
I am ashamed

40:58.706 --> 41:01.458
that my word as king

41:01.542 --> 41:05.087
meant nothing
to some of you!

41:06.672 --> 41:08.715
That you organized this...

41:10.385 --> 41:13.970
This catastrophe
among yourselves.

41:14.055 --> 41:17.724
That you took it
upon yourselves

41:17.809 --> 41:20.394
to violate a treaty

41:20.478 --> 41:23.772
that I had signed
in good faith!

41:28.444 --> 41:30.278
God knows what
the Northmen will make

41:30.363 --> 41:32.614
of these terrible events.

41:34.242 --> 41:37.953
My name and my word
as King of Wessex

41:38.037 --> 41:41.206
will mean nothing
to them!

41:45.211 --> 41:49.172
But it cannot be,
it cannot be.
It cannot be.

41:49.257 --> 41:52.843
I cannot allow
and I cannot
tolerate treason.

41:52.927 --> 41:54.052
Guards!

41:54.762 --> 41:59.057
Arrest this man! This man!
And this! And him!

41:59.142 --> 42:01.143
All for treason!

42:01.227 --> 42:05.689
And my Lord Radolf.
Arrest him also.

42:05.773 --> 42:06.815
Wait, Sire...

42:06.899 --> 42:09.693
For I showed
him nothing,

42:09.777 --> 42:11.820
nothing but love,

42:11.904 --> 42:15.657
and this...
This treachery is my reward?

42:17.952 --> 42:20.412
Out of my sight!

42:21.706 --> 42:25.459
And Aethelwulf,
you think you will
escape so lightly?

42:29.088 --> 42:32.048
All of you! Leave!

42:32.133 --> 42:34.759
I need to speak alone
with my son!

43:06.292 --> 43:07.626
Thank you.

43:08.294 --> 43:10.462
Thank you, my son.

43:13.382 --> 43:16.259
You did the
business so well.

43:17.678 --> 43:20.514
How could we
ever have allowed
these Northmen

43:20.598 --> 43:22.349
to establish
themselves here?

43:22.433 --> 43:24.809
It's unthinkable.

43:27.813 --> 43:30.398
And I played
my part well,
did I not?

43:30.483 --> 43:32.567
Yes, Father.
Very well.

43:33.694 --> 43:35.278
By this ruse,

43:35.363 --> 43:39.574
we have now caught
out all of those nobles
who question my rule

43:39.659 --> 43:43.537
and we have reason
now to rid ourselves
of them permanently.

43:45.039 --> 43:47.457
Mmm.
It worked out well.

43:49.502 --> 43:50.585
No.

43:52.255 --> 43:55.757
It worked out
beautifully, my son.

43:57.552 --> 44:00.720
Even Charlemagne
would have approved.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.390
Don't you think so?
