00:10.960 --> 00:14.470
Two swans move their heads about...

00:14.520 --> 00:17.670
I eat a shoe...

00:17.720 --> 00:19.310
and James says he's not fat.

00:19.360 --> 00:20.840
I'm not fat.

00:22.920 --> 00:25.880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:28.040 --> 00:29.230
Welcome, everybody.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.470
Hello, good evening.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.270
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.790
Now...

00:34.840 --> 00:39.710
Thank you. Now, our deep
and profound love on this show

00:39.760 --> 00:44.830
for Alfa Romeo is a
triumph of hope over reality.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.510
We always pray that their new
models will be brilliant

00:48.560 --> 00:51.550
but sort of know they won't be
and then they never are.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.270
But what about this?

00:53.320 --> 00:56.470
The new and very pretty 4C.

00:56.520 --> 01:00.750
Well, Richard Hammond has been to
Northern Italy, in the sunshine,

01:00.800 --> 01:04.230
to find out all about it.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.070
Jammy little bu...

01:06.120 --> 01:08.080
BELL RINGS

01:11.880 --> 01:13.800
CAR ENGINE REVS

01:20.000 --> 01:22.750
Right, let's get this straight -

01:22.800 --> 01:26.320
I'm in a mid-engined,
two-seater Alfa Romeo.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.960
The first proper Alfa sports
car for 20 years.

01:34.520 --> 01:39.270
And I'm driving it in Northern Italy,
on a lovely day.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.760
In theory,
things don't get much better.

01:44.720 --> 01:49.880
But, predictably,
there are one or two problems.

01:52.880 --> 01:57.230
First of all,
it's going to cost around £45,000.

01:57.280 --> 02:02.590
And that's a fair bit, especially
as you don't get a V8, or even V6.

02:02.640 --> 02:07.070
What you do get is a turbo-charged,
reworked version of the 1.7 litre,

02:07.120 --> 02:10.789
four-cylinder engine from a
Giulietta hatchback.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.430
And under here...

02:12.480 --> 02:16.880
Well, I don't know what's under here
cos the bonnet is bolted shut.

02:19.920 --> 02:25.150
It's bolted shut for the same reason
this car has no power steering,

02:25.200 --> 02:28.270
and no proper climate control -

02:28.320 --> 02:30.990
to save weight.

02:31.040 --> 02:33.030
That's why it has the same sort of

02:33.080 --> 02:36.870
carbon-fibre chassis as a
Formula 1 car.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.880
It's why there's almost no
metal in the body at all.

02:42.720 --> 02:47.990
The upshot is,
the 4C weighs just 925kg.

02:48.040 --> 02:52.360
That's about half what
a Mercedes SLK weighs.

02:57.280 --> 03:01.590
And on a road like this,
that really pays dividends.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.270
Oh, come on!

03:03.320 --> 03:04.560
Lovely.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.310
Because it's light,
it's unbelievably agile.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.200
It changes direction like a kitten
chasing a spider.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.990
And because there's no power
steering, I can feel

03:25.040 --> 03:28.720
far more at the steering wheel and
know what the wheels are doing.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.600
It grips...

03:35.080 --> 03:36.600
..fabulously.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.510
It doesn't need a massive engine -

03:41.560 --> 03:45.870
it's got 237 brake horsepower.
Do you know what? That is enough.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.320
More than enough.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.390
0 to 60 takes four-and-a-half
seconds.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.830
The top speed is 160.

03:56.880 --> 04:01.480
And yet, because of the lightness,
it'll do 40 miles to the gallon.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.870
Drop a window, sample the noise.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.590
LOUD REVS

04:08.640 --> 04:11.880
Oh! Lovely little
crackle on the up-shift.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.829
Oh, it's great.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.950
This little Alfa is growing on me
with a speed

04:20.000 --> 04:23.310
and ferocity that I've
never before encountered.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.640
It's just getting under my skin.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.510
Because it's not like anything
else...

04:29.560 --> 04:31.950
Oh, my God!

04:32.000 --> 04:33.440
What?

04:35.760 --> 04:38.510
What are you doing here?

04:38.560 --> 04:42.950
As you well know, Hammond,
we receive thousands of letters

04:43.000 --> 04:46.830
every single week from viewers
and they all say the same thing.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.870
"Dear Top so-called Gear,
the Alfa 4C,

04:49.920 --> 04:51.990
"is it better than quad bike?"

04:52.040 --> 04:55.030
Well, I can clear than one up
straight away - yes, it is because

04:55.080 --> 04:59.870
quad bikes are slow, ugly, noisy,
stupid and incredibly dangerous.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.270
And I don't mean dangerous like you
might fall off,

05:02.320 --> 05:03.790
I mean like they want to kill you.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.750
Everybody I know, pretty much,
who's ever tried one, has been

05:06.800 --> 05:08.030
killed by it at some point.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.950
Yup. That's as maybe,
but we need to settle this,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.550
so we're going to have a race.
We're going to race? Yeah.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.190
You on that, presumably? Yeah.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.190
Me in that? Yeah.

05:17.240 --> 05:21.630
Jeremy's proposal was a race
from the top of Lake Como

05:21.680 --> 05:24.390
to a hotel terrace at the bottom.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.350
I would take
the 43-mile lakeside route,

05:27.400 --> 05:30.840
whilst he would attempt to
go as the crow flies.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.920
Good, you're going
to be killed and last.

05:36.280 --> 05:42.320
And so, at exactly 10.37am,
the race began.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.080
Here we go.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.190
Let me talk you through my quad.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.470
It's called a Gibbs Quadski,

05:57.520 --> 06:02.470
designed and engineered in Britain,
built just outside Detroit

06:02.520 --> 06:07.230
and the engine is German -
a 1.3 from a BMW motorcycle.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.800
And you have 40 horsepower.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.960
Doesn't sound like much
but like the Alfa, it's light.

06:15.480 --> 06:19.390
Apparently it has the same
power-to-weight ratio

06:19.440 --> 06:20.800
as a helicopter.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.950
He's mad. I mean,
he doesn't stand a chance.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.430
I know what he's thinking -

06:27.480 --> 06:31.310
he's imagining he'll be crashing
off-road and cutting corners.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.990
He won't - he'll be bumbling through
the woods on little tracks,

06:35.040 --> 06:38.160
he'll get stuck, fall off,
break a leg - maybe two.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.190
Hammond was wrong.
My legs were fine,

06:43.240 --> 06:48.750
but I had got into a bit of a pickle
trying to find a shortcut.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.830
Totally lost.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.080
Literally no idea which...

06:53.480 --> 06:54.590
No idea.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.720
I'm just in weeds...

06:58.520 --> 07:00.840
Oh, now which way?

07:02.280 --> 07:04.510
With Jeremy stuck in the undergrowth,

07:04.560 --> 07:11.000
I had time to admire one of the most
beautiful places on Earth.

07:18.440 --> 07:23.360
Ah! Mountains, pretty village -
all present and correct.

07:27.720 --> 07:28.830
Coming through.

07:28.880 --> 07:33.990
See, this scooter rider will not mind
me whizzing past in my Alfa Romeo,

07:34.040 --> 07:39.110
because I know he loves Alfa Romeo
just as much, if not more, than I do.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.360
We have to love Alfa, it's the law.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.310
Meanwhile...

07:46.360 --> 07:49.670
Oh. God. No, wait.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.190
Many nettles.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.350
This may have a top speed of 40

07:54.400 --> 07:57.110
but I'm not doing that now, really.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.710
Happily, however,

07:58.760 --> 08:04.510
Hammond was about to discover one
of the Alfa's drawbacks - its girth.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.230
Oh, no! Oh, my God, this is narrow!

08:08.280 --> 08:10.670
Oh! That's...

08:10.720 --> 08:14.150
This car is wide.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.920
That's a problem.

08:16.960 --> 08:20.470
So what were they thinking
when they've got streets like this?

08:20.520 --> 08:22.160
I mean... Oh!

08:23.880 --> 08:26.200
Still, could be worse.

08:30.840 --> 08:34.830
Oh, no! Now look what I've done.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.120
I've accidentally
crashed into Lake Como.

08:39.799 --> 08:44.600
But it's OK, because
if I push this little button here...

08:50.200 --> 08:55.080
..the wheels have folded up
and now I'm on a jet ski.

08:56.520 --> 09:01.230
Oh, and it gets better because,
on land, it has 40 horsepower,

09:01.280 --> 09:05.360
but here on water it has 140.

09:10.320 --> 09:15.230
I know exactly what music
we have to play right now.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.150
♪ We are sailing... ♪

09:17.200 --> 09:18.430
No, not that!

09:18.480 --> 09:19.710
Cue the Bond!

09:19.760 --> 09:23.080
MUSIC: "James Bond Theme"

09:33.160 --> 09:35.470
Here we go - 45 miles an hour!

09:35.520 --> 09:39.720
Hammond, wherever you are,
you can't beat this.

09:44.280 --> 09:47.320
Narrow. Really narrow.
Really wide car.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.200
I'd like to be driving something
narrower now, like a bus.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.680
Right, clear of town, press on.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.990
So let's just get this straight -

10:07.040 --> 10:11.590
I'm wearing a wet white shirt
and I'm in a lake - I'm Mr Darcy!

10:11.640 --> 10:13.120
Come on!

10:20.880 --> 10:23.560
There is Richard Hammond.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.110
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

10:29.160 --> 10:30.990
I'll slow down a bit.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.190
'Hello? Hello?'

10:33.240 --> 10:35.190
Er, hello. Where are you?

10:35.240 --> 10:37.990
'To your left, mate, to your left.'

10:38.040 --> 10:40.750
You can't be to my left.
How can you be to my left?

10:40.800 --> 10:42.630
What?

10:42.680 --> 10:45.990
'Have you ever seen anything
like this?'

10:46.040 --> 10:49.750
What are you on?
Is that the same quad?

10:49.800 --> 10:51.430
It certainly is.

10:51.480 --> 10:55.270
And I'm afraid
I must now say goodbye.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.400
'Cheerio. See you soon.'

10:59.640 --> 11:02.120
Cheating sod!

11:03.760 --> 11:06.350
He can just go
straight across the lake now.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.070
I've got to go all the way
down the bottom here

11:09.120 --> 11:11.110
and back up the other side.

11:11.160 --> 11:15.120
I'm going to lose this and he's going
to do his stupid smug face.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.720
Spurred on by the horror
of his face...

11:23.120 --> 11:25.520
..I put the hammer down.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.760
Come on, little Alfa.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.710
We were neck and neck,

11:39.760 --> 11:43.600
but then Jeremy got
distracted by an Italian ferry.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.480
Look at that!

11:49.160 --> 11:51.680
What a machine.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.600
I'm sorry I'm hearing the Bond
music again now.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.430
You want a race?

11:59.480 --> 12:01.280
I'll give you a race.

12:16.920 --> 12:20.440
Oh, come on, I can't lose this!

12:26.600 --> 12:30.670
By this stage, I'd disentangled
myself from the hydrofoil,

12:30.720 --> 12:35.960
but had run into another problem -
Lake Como's weird winds.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.120
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

12:42.600 --> 12:44.520
I think we've got some chop.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.880
Wow!

12:48.920 --> 12:50.310
I've lost ten miles....

12:50.360 --> 12:51.790
Aw!

12:51.840 --> 12:55.270
Ow, my back bottom!

12:55.320 --> 12:58.030
Wow! Wow!

12:58.080 --> 12:59.720
They slow you down a bit.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.870
Oh, my...

13:02.920 --> 13:04.870
That was a big one.

13:04.920 --> 13:09.030
I'm now down to 15 miles an hour,
and I can't realistically go

13:09.080 --> 13:13.630
any faster, cos
I can't see where I'm bloody going.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.920
The vicious chop had put Hammond
back in the lead.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.080
We have to beat him.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.790
Thankfully, on the lake,
I'd found calmer water.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.200
45 miles an hour.

13:36.760 --> 13:40.080
We are back in this race.

13:50.040 --> 13:53.350
There he is.
There is Richard Hammond.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.950
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

13:56.000 --> 13:58.710
Goodbye, Hammond.

13:58.760 --> 14:01.080
He is history.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.830
It certainly seemed that way,

14:06.880 --> 14:10.390
because pretty soon
the hotel was in sight.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.600
There it is, there's
the finishing line.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.830
So, I was definitely going
to win this.

14:18.880 --> 14:24.310
But then I realised
the victory would be a bit hollow.

14:24.360 --> 14:28.710
Obviously, I want to beat Hammond,
of course I do.

14:28.760 --> 14:33.630
But I don't want to beat that
Alfa Romeo, because, to me,

14:33.680 --> 14:36.030
Alfas are special.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.430
They're really special.

14:38.480 --> 14:42.350
This is a bit like having a running
race with your four-year-old son -

14:42.400 --> 14:46.880
yes, of course you can win, but you
don't really want to.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.600
It's not far now.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.760
Little Alfa, I think
we have to accept the inevitable.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.830
He's not there, is he?

15:00.880 --> 15:03.710
In a few minutes,
Hammond would arrive

15:03.760 --> 15:08.750
and see my Quadski moored
alongside the hotel's jetty.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.680
Damn and blast, I'm going
to win this.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.630
Nothing I can do.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.030
But then...

15:16.080 --> 15:18.390
I spotted a hidey-hole.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.400
Yes!

15:21.880 --> 15:26.480
Sometimes I stagger even
myself with my genius.

15:28.400 --> 15:31.800
Oh, no. Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.160
Right, where is he?

15:57.800 --> 16:00.120
This is the terrace.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.640
Up here maybe.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.120
Do you know what?

16:15.120 --> 16:20.400
He no here. I don't know how.
What I've done is win...

16:21.520 --> 16:26.510
..in that little Alfa.
Hammond! Mate. Well done.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.990
You beat me fair and square. I did.

16:29.040 --> 16:33.790
In the Alfa. Do you know? I would
have bet £1 million...

16:33.840 --> 16:37.350
when I overtook you,
I was going to win.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.440
APPLAUSE

16:44.600 --> 16:47.390
Your question is answered.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.590
The Alfa 4C is better
than the quad bike.

16:51.640 --> 16:56.030
Yes, but we saw you lose on purpose.
A bit, just a bit.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.310
Did you not like the jet ski,
Quadski thing?

16:58.360 --> 16:59.510
Yes, it's brilliant.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.390
Do you know, the best
thing about it is its reliability.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.230
It performed faultlessly all day

17:05.280 --> 17:09.030
and then it performed
faultlessly all the next day

17:09.079 --> 17:12.310
when we had to rerun the race
because an American

17:12.359 --> 17:16.230
knocked the camera with all the film
it into the lake. Really?

17:16.280 --> 17:17.630
LAUGHTER

17:17.680 --> 17:20.710
I was on this thing for two days,
two days.

17:20.760 --> 17:25.430
By the time we finished, my sausage
looked like a beaver's tail.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.910
LAUGHTER

17:27.960 --> 17:33.670
Right, um, is it expensive?
What, my sausage? No, the thing.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.910
Oh, the thing, yes,
it's £26,000, but, no, hang on,

17:36.960 --> 17:42.550
you do get a lot of health and
safety warning notices for that.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.910
This is my favourite down here.

17:44.960 --> 17:50.070
It's warning about what you have
to wear and it says, hang on,

17:50.120 --> 17:55.030
"Normal swimwear does not adequately
protect against forceful

17:55.080 --> 17:59.110
"water entry into rectum or vagina."

17:59.160 --> 18:00.720
LAUGHTER

18:05.040 --> 18:09.150
He's not making that up.
It says vagina on it.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.430
Excuse me, does anyone mind
if we talk about the car for a bit?

18:12.480 --> 18:14.470
It's a car show and everything.

18:14.520 --> 18:18.750
Good, cos I've got some questions
about this. How wide is it?

18:18.800 --> 18:21.950
It's wider than a Range Rover. Is it?
Seriously? Very wide.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.670
And let me get this straight,

18:23.720 --> 18:27.990
Alfa Romeo is selling a car
where you can't open the bonnet?

18:28.040 --> 18:29.150
Yeah, I know.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.590
Ballsy. Yeah. Ballsy. It is, yes,

18:31.640 --> 18:34.990
but that's not the interesting thing
about it.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.470
What is the interesting thing?

18:36.520 --> 18:38.710
Well, it costs £47,000,
but when you get in it,

18:38.760 --> 18:43.630
everything feels just feels a bit
cheap and plasticky.

18:43.680 --> 18:47.030
Look at this handbrake, it's just...

18:47.080 --> 18:50.550
It's like something that came
out of a cracker.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.950
You know, if I got the handbrake in
a Christmas cracker,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.510
I'd be a bit disappointed. You know
what I mean. Yes, I do.

18:56.560 --> 19:00.030
It's just that there are a lot
of EU rules coming very soon

19:00.080 --> 19:02.350
on fuel efficiency and emissions
and so on,

19:02.400 --> 19:04.950
and the only way that cars
can meet them

19:05.000 --> 19:07.670
is if they get very, very light.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.830
Yeah. And pretty soon, all cars
will have to be made like this,

19:10.880 --> 19:14.270
but do you know what? I don't think
that's necessarily a bad thing.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.990
Yes, you get a shonky handbrake,
but your car is more nimble.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.310
It's faster and it's more economical.

19:20.360 --> 19:24.670
And for the ultimate expression
of that art, later in the show,

19:24.720 --> 19:31.790
we have a review of this - the new
McLaren P1, which is astonishing.

19:31.840 --> 19:37.230
Well, I am very much looking forward
to that, but first it's the news.

19:37.280 --> 19:41.790
Yes. Now Kia is working on something
called "gesture control".

19:41.840 --> 19:45.430
It's very interesting,
because of instead of having

19:45.480 --> 19:49.190
buttons all over
the dashboard of your car, you just

19:49.240 --> 19:53.030
sort of wave your hand around a bit,
and the car will do stuff.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.350
Very futuristic.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.870
Yeah, but I only make three
gestures when I'm driving a car.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.470
LAUGHTER

19:59.520 --> 20:01.750
What? One of them is...

20:01.800 --> 20:05.030
which means I'm really sorry,
I didn't mean to do that.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.790
Then there's...hi, to a friend.
And... Call Jeremy Clarkson.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.710
LAUGHTER

20:10.760 --> 20:14.760
Or navigate to James May's house.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.790
Oh, now, now...you know
those motorway gantries

20:19.840 --> 20:21.630
that are supposed to be used
to tell you

20:21.680 --> 20:25.190
about stationary traffic ahead
or ice, but they're actually used

20:25.240 --> 20:27.950
for telling you stuff
that doesn't matter.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.310
We've got a picture of one here -
"Check your fuel level."

20:32.360 --> 20:35.150
It might as well say, "Wash your
hands after going to the lavatory."

20:35.200 --> 20:36.390
"Brush your hair."

20:36.440 --> 20:39.470
Well, anyway, the committee that
decides on what messages
flashed up -

20:39.520 --> 20:42.470
and it is a committee, we checked -
has been told to stop doing

20:42.520 --> 20:46.670
that sort of thing, OK, because the
government says it's distracting.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.870
But it isn't distracting,
it's irritating.

20:48.920 --> 20:51.950
Scarlett Johansson in a short skirt
on a windy day on a motorway bridge,

20:52.000 --> 20:55.470
that is distracting.
That would be. It's distracting now.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.870
It's distracting me right now.

20:56.920 --> 21:00.350
I think what would be distracting
would be painting

21:00.400 --> 21:03.310
the surface of the motorway so it
looked like the opening sequences

21:03.360 --> 21:05.350
of Doctor Who
as you drove along.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.190
That would be really distracting.

21:07.240 --> 21:10.710
I think they should use those signs
to put up a pub quiz questions

21:10.760 --> 21:14.390
as you drive past.
That's a really good idea.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.110
What, and then you'd have
the answer on the next one along?

21:17.160 --> 21:19.790
Yes, journeys would just fly by.
"ooh, I don't know."

21:19.840 --> 21:22.430
And then you get the answer.
That's brilliant. Yes, thank you.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.230
Not if my little sister
set the questions.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.070
Why? Because you'd get
the question on one,

21:26.120 --> 21:29.030
and then the next one would go,
"Oh, come on, you must know that!"

21:29.080 --> 21:32.510
Please can we move on?
I'd like to talk about this.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.950
It's the new Corvette Z06. Oh, yes.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.070
Supercharged V8 6.2 litres
625 brake horsepower.

21:38.120 --> 21:41.830
It's got a magnetic ride control,
electronic diff, carbon fibre.

21:41.880 --> 21:45.190
All the hi-tech stuff
you get on a European sports car...

21:45.240 --> 21:48.310
But does it have the European
self-restraint, though, does it?

21:48.360 --> 21:50.510
It's a bit more shock 'em all
than stiff upper lip.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.190
Yes, but look at it.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.310
No, Hammond, you can't drive
a Corvette in England.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.190
It's like talking in a lift -
you can do that in America,

21:58.240 --> 22:00.110
you can't do that in Britain.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.830
In fact, we should have signs at
Heathrow telling American visitors,

22:02.880 --> 22:05.630
"Please drive on the left
and don't talk in lifts."

22:05.680 --> 22:08.750
Yes, yes, whatever,
but I think that looks stupendous.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.390
Yes, yes, it would
look stupendous in Texas,

22:12.440 --> 22:16.150
but it would look ridiculous
in Tewkesbury. It would.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.870
Hammond, if you bought one of those
and drove it around England,

22:18.920 --> 22:21.270
the next thing you would be
hanging up a Confederate flag

22:21.320 --> 22:22.430
outside your house.

22:22.480 --> 22:25.430
I did paint a Confederate flag
on the roof of my Toyota Corolla

22:25.480 --> 22:26.470
when I was 17.

22:26.520 --> 22:29.150
Where were you?
Ripon. North Yorkshire.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.710
What? It looked brilliant.
Let me just get this straight.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.270
You drove around North Yorkshire
in a crappy little Japanese
hatchback

22:35.320 --> 22:39.230
with a Confederate flag
on the roof?

22:39.280 --> 22:43.200
Yes. Yes. A symbol of slavery.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.510
Ladies and gentlemen,
12 Years A Hammond!

22:48.560 --> 22:51.030
I didn't realise -
I just thought it looked nice.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.990
The base model of this -
not the Z06,

22:53.040 --> 22:54.830
the normal one - 60 grand? 62, yes.

22:54.880 --> 22:58.150
Well, for about the same sort
of money, you can have this,

22:58.200 --> 22:59.510
which is the new Jag.

22:59.560 --> 23:00.910
This is the F-type Coupe.

23:00.960 --> 23:04.550
That's around the same sort of
money, and I put it to you that

23:04.600 --> 23:06.110
what we have here is a lovely piece

23:06.160 --> 23:09.750
of double Gloucester
on a water biscuit.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.190
Your Corvette is 600 kilos of...

23:12.240 --> 23:14.350
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
..Monterrey Jack on a taco.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.270
Yeah, that's right.
I'd rather have that.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.750
You'd rather have the Monterey Jack,
wouldn't you?

23:18.800 --> 23:21.190
Yes. Hang on a minute.
Surely it's 600 kilograms of...

23:21.240 --> 23:24.270
(AMERICAN ACCENT) Monterey Jack
on a taco with a strawberry on top.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.430
Strawberry.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.230
At as long as
there's a strawberry on top.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.870
Are there any Americans here? Whoo!

23:28.920 --> 23:31.270
You are. Oh, we've wondered
about this for years.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.110
Why do you put these on everything?

23:33.160 --> 23:35.710
Because they taste good.
Yes, but not on a shepherd's pie.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.270
LAUGHTER

23:37.320 --> 23:40.070
This is not an exaggeration.
I stayed in a hotel in LA.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.470
I had to have some dry cleaning
done, and when it came back

23:42.520 --> 23:45.390
in the morning, it was all wrapped
up, and there was a strawberry
on it.

23:45.440 --> 23:47.710
What, on your dry-cleaning?
On my dry-cleaning.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.550
Now, this isn't news -
it's a question.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.150
Why is the world still
incapable of working out

23:53.200 --> 23:55.470
a way of dispensing petrol?
Anyone been to America?

23:55.520 --> 23:58.350
Well, you've all been to America,
I suppose, at some point.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.030
You go into a petrol station there

24:00.080 --> 24:03.790
and you have to pay for the fuel
before you fill your tank.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.550
Well, you don't
know how much you want

24:05.600 --> 24:06.870
or how much it's going to take.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.830
Yes, but I hate those European
stations

24:08.880 --> 24:11.310
where they have those automatic
credit card ones. Don't work.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.670
Never ever work. The other one
that doesn't work,

24:13.720 --> 24:15.950
and especially in France,
are those ones

24:16.000 --> 24:18.430
where you're supposed to put
euro notes in a little slot.

24:18.480 --> 24:22.240
No. You put it in and it goes,
"Nnnngh! Nnnngh!" Oh.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.350
There's a lot of people doing
that, and it goes, "Nnnngh!"

24:26.400 --> 24:29.230
I'll give you the worst scenario,
James.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.910
Worst scenario is, "Nnnngh!"

24:30.960 --> 24:33.190
"Yes, there we go," get the pump
out, "Nnnngh!"

24:33.240 --> 24:38.590
But the worst country in the world
for filling up with petrol is
Britain,

24:38.640 --> 24:44.030
because petrol stations here
now are also supermarkets,

24:44.080 --> 24:46.110
which means that people pull up
at the pump

24:46.160 --> 24:47.550
and then go and do their shopping.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.590
Well, that is
exactly why I was late this morning,

24:49.640 --> 24:52.030
cos I pulled up behind
the car that was at the pump

24:52.080 --> 24:54.710
ready for my turn and I knew
who it was through the window -

24:54.760 --> 24:57.910
it was a woman and she was doing
the whole weekly groceries shop -

24:57.960 --> 25:00.550
and she came out with the
four massive carrier bags,

25:00.600 --> 25:02.190
and I thought, "That's finally it,"

25:02.240 --> 25:04.270
and then she went to
the cash machine... Oh...

25:04.320 --> 25:07.990
..sorted out Greece's
national debt with her card.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.310
I am a patient man, but even I...
I was thinking,

25:10.360 --> 25:13.670
"I want to put your head in a brown
paper bag and bludgeon you to death

25:13.720 --> 25:16.310
"with the blunt end of an axe."

25:16.360 --> 25:19.670
That's quite bad. Do you know?
My question is petrol stations is -

25:19.720 --> 25:23.230
and we could ask this here -
and it's mostly women,

25:23.280 --> 25:27.510
what do you do in the 15 minutes
between getting into the car

25:27.560 --> 25:28.670
and driving off?

25:28.720 --> 25:31.910
I know what it is, I know
what it is. What? I watched it.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.710
She turned round and she put her
handbag on the back seat,

25:34.760 --> 25:38.510
fair enough, but then interfered
with it for some time.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.190
Doing what, though?

25:40.240 --> 25:43.230
I suspect women try to make sure
their handbag doesn't fall over,

25:43.280 --> 25:46.870
which I don't understand,
because women's handbags
are not well organised,

25:46.920 --> 25:49.150
so it doesn't matter
if it falls over.

25:49.200 --> 25:52.510
I reckon I could put a house brick
in a woman's handbag,

25:52.560 --> 25:57.230
and she would not know it was there
ever. Have you got handbag with you?

25:57.280 --> 26:00.390
No. You haven't?
Anyone got handbag? It's in the car.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.630
That's a shame,
because I was going to do this game.

26:02.680 --> 26:03.950
I was going to put my car keys,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.870
and it's a Jag this week,
in your handbag and then,

26:06.920 --> 26:10.270
if you could find them by the end
of the show, you could have the car.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.990
You wouldn't be able to.

26:12.040 --> 26:15.230
Two angry old men
rampaging on about petrol stations.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.920
Him and his cardigan, him...
just him.

26:19.680 --> 26:22.110
Now, as I'm sure you know,
after 13 years,

26:22.160 --> 26:25.190
the British military forces
are pulling out of Afghanistan.

26:25.240 --> 26:28.950
What you may not know is that that
operation has been the biggest
deployment

26:29.000 --> 26:32.990
of British military vehicles
since World War II.

26:33.040 --> 26:36.630
Now, bringing that lot home
is quite a big job,

26:36.680 --> 26:40.840
so I packed my tin helmet and
went out there to...get in the way.

26:45.600 --> 26:49.430
'If you want to get a sense of just
how big the British involvement

26:49.480 --> 26:52.630
'in Afghanistan has become,

26:52.680 --> 26:56.960
'you just have to look at the size
of its main base - Camp Bastion.'

27:01.800 --> 27:05.750
In 2006,
when British forces arrived here,

27:05.800 --> 27:10.670
it was just a scrap of desert
with a few tents in, but now look.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.320
It's the size of Reading.

27:20.720 --> 27:25.590
'And inside its 25 miles
of blast-proof perimeter wall

27:25.640 --> 27:29.030
'alongside the few comforts of home,

27:29.080 --> 27:32.800
'you'll find a vast armada
of vehicles.

27:35.840 --> 27:40.200
'At its peak, the number was 5,000.'

27:42.440 --> 27:44.190
We've got a few of them here.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.630
The names will be dimly familiar
from news reports.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.590
That is a Ridgeback,
that is a Mastiff,

27:49.640 --> 27:53.390
then you have a Foxhound,
the pale-coloured one is a Husky,

27:53.440 --> 27:56.990
and that weird-looking thing with
the tracks on over there,
that is a Warthog.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.630
Don't expect cute and cuddly
names like Panda or Fiesta -

28:00.680 --> 28:05.110
everything here is named
after a dog, except the Warthog,

28:05.160 --> 28:07.400
which is named after a warthog.

28:09.120 --> 28:13.030
'To keep the wheels turning,
the Army has built this enormous
workshop,

28:13.080 --> 28:16.150
'which, at full strength,
carries £60 million worth

28:16.200 --> 28:20.480
'of spares and employs
150 mechanics.

28:24.320 --> 28:27.030
'Bastion even has its own
purpose-built

28:27.080 --> 28:31.800
'driver training ground, approved
by a squad of driving instructors.'

28:33.680 --> 28:37.710
The sheer size of this operation
is truly impressive,

28:37.760 --> 28:42.190
but equally fascinating is what
the Afghanistan campaign has done

28:42.240 --> 28:44.440
to Britain's military vehicles.

28:46.560 --> 28:50.070
'It has brought about the biggest
change in a generation.

28:50.120 --> 28:53.470
'When the British first arrived
here, their staple patrol vehicle,

28:53.520 --> 28:57.550
'the Snatch Land Rover, offered
woeful protection against IEDs.

28:57.600 --> 29:04.040
'In 2009 alone, 79 soldiers
fell victim to such devices.'

29:10.480 --> 29:13.670
'The 29-tonne American-made Mastiff
offered a quick fix,

29:13.720 --> 29:15.670
'but in Leamington Spa,

29:15.720 --> 29:19.560
'a small British firm devised
a more 21st-century solution.'

29:26.080 --> 29:29.390
This is a Foxhound
and it's very clever,

29:29.440 --> 29:31.470
because it's actually
made out of armour.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.350
It's not a normal vehicle to which
armour plate has been added.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.880
It's sort of armour monoblock,
if you like.

29:39.080 --> 29:43.510
'The Foxhound also has a V-shaped
hull to deflect mine blasts

29:43.560 --> 29:47.030
'and thanks to its state-of-the-art
armour, it weighs

29:47.080 --> 29:49.190
'just seven and a half tonnes,

29:49.240 --> 29:51.800
'which makes it a featherweight
around these parts.'

29:54.720 --> 29:58.400
To drive, is pretty much like
an off-road car.

30:00.280 --> 30:03.120
It's a positive mountain goat,
this thing.

30:04.120 --> 30:07.070
'Now, history will record that
government bureaucrats

30:07.120 --> 30:09.630
'dragged their heels
over the military vehicle crisis

30:09.680 --> 30:11.070
'in Afghanistan,

30:11.120 --> 30:14.710
'but the boffins who developed
the Foxhound certainly didn't.'

30:14.760 --> 30:17.710
This machine was designed,
engineered, tested, proved

30:17.760 --> 30:22.390
and got on the ground in large
numbers in just over three years.

30:22.440 --> 30:26.720
Try doing that with a small
hatchback or something.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.720
'Alongside the Foxhound...

30:35.480 --> 30:36.830
'..the military drew on a policy

30:36.880 --> 30:40.030
'called Urgent Operational
Requirement or UOR,

30:40.080 --> 30:42.630
'which saw them combine
operational demands

30:42.680 --> 30:46.440
'and the best vehicle-related
suggestions from soldiers
on the ground.'

30:49.400 --> 30:52.840
Here's a very simple example
of UOR - this is a Mastiff.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.790
It's got cameras mounted
on the sides.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.630
Commander Buzz here can
look at the pictures on his screen.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.110
On the early ones,
they were originally mounted.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.750
When you went through things
like villages, they got smashed.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.190
So somebody said,
"Why not put them on a hinge?"

31:07.240 --> 31:08.760
So they did.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.790
'Soldiers also needed their vehicles
to be more stealthy in the dark.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.390
'So a night-vision system
was developed

31:18.440 --> 31:21.550
'that would allow them
to switch off their headlights.'

31:21.600 --> 31:25.070
I'm now driving the Mastiff
completely blacked out

31:25.120 --> 31:28.790
but using the night-vision system
suspended in front of my face.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.190
And this is quite amazing.

31:31.240 --> 31:35.560
This is actually my eyes. I can't
see a single thing through the
windscreen.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.910
'These lamps on the outside
are infrared

31:39.960 --> 31:41.910
'and illuminate
the surrounding area.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.030
'Our camera can see
the light they emit,

31:44.080 --> 31:46.750
'but it's invisible
to the naked eye.'

31:46.800 --> 31:51.390
We ought to point out that normally,
we wouldn't even have these
red interior lights on.

31:51.440 --> 31:54.070
Those are there
so our cameras are working properly.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.070
But actually,
you could drive this....

31:56.120 --> 31:59.830
we could be completely
black in here, couldn't we?
Yeah, complete blackout, yeah.

31:59.880 --> 32:01.510
Right, so I've missed those...

32:01.560 --> 32:03.750
what are those, are they rocks
or are they...?

32:03.800 --> 32:06.190
Yeah, they're just in front of you.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.710
Straightening up, sir.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.150
See that compound ahead of us?
Yeah.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.430
You want to be going
round to the left of that.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.430
I can see that as clear as day.

32:14.480 --> 32:18.110
It's a good piece of kit, isn't it?
It's brilliant, isn't it?

32:18.160 --> 32:21.310
'Now, on a machine is heavily
armoured is a Mastiff,

32:21.360 --> 32:24.550
'the protection against
roadside bombs is good.

32:24.600 --> 32:28.160
'But Afghanistan threw up another
issue that needed sorting.'

32:29.240 --> 32:33.630
What if the vehicle is blown
over? How do you train for that?

32:33.680 --> 32:35.990
SHOUTING

32:36.040 --> 32:39.590
Well, what you do is
you build one of these.

32:39.640 --> 32:44.270
It's a RODET - Roll Over Drills
Egress Trainer.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.150
Oh!

32:46.200 --> 32:48.080
And I think we're upside down.

32:52.520 --> 32:57.110
'All these improvements have had
a dramatic effect on military
motoring out here.'

32:57.160 --> 33:00.910
Since the new generation
of PMVs was introduced -

33:00.960 --> 33:04.270
that's protective military
vehicles...the Mastiff,

33:04.320 --> 33:06.510
the Foxhound, the Husky,

33:06.560 --> 33:08.670
the Warthog, all those things -

33:08.720 --> 33:13.830
there have been over 1,000
survivors of IED strikes
on vehicles.

33:13.880 --> 33:18.790
And a senior British officer
admitted to me the other day that,

33:18.840 --> 33:21.350
in the old days, when we had
the soft-skinned vehicles -

33:21.400 --> 33:23.630
the Snatch Land Rover and so on -

33:23.680 --> 33:27.680
that might have been more like
three casualties per vehicle.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.230
'With our troops now coming home,

33:36.280 --> 33:39.110
'this stuff is too valuable
to leave behind.

33:39.160 --> 33:42.790
'So a massive operation is under way
to bring it back to Britain.

33:42.840 --> 33:46.750
'At forward bases like this one,
all the vehicles and spares

33:46.800 --> 33:49.910
'are being gathered up
for the drive back to Bastion.

33:49.960 --> 33:53.270
'Which meant that,
in the middle of the night,

33:53.320 --> 33:56.190
'I found myself in a convoy
of returning vehicles

33:56.240 --> 33:58.550
'in full Ross Kemp mode.'

33:58.600 --> 34:01.950
We're in a Mastiff.
We're in a convoy of 31 vehicles.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.110
These legs belong to Sue, who's up
the top on the gun, keeping lookout.

34:06.160 --> 34:09.870
Hello. Morning. Morning, ma'am. Is
there room for two of us up there?

34:09.920 --> 34:14.870
We can give it a go. Right, I'll
move this way a bit. There we go.
Ow.

34:14.920 --> 34:18.949
I don't think we're going to fit on.
I've pulled something off.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.480
HE GROANS

34:24.040 --> 34:26.480
I'm not fat.

34:28.440 --> 34:32.030
What's to stop somebody... Cos we
can't really see very much out
there.

34:32.080 --> 34:35.230
What's to stop somebody out there
just taking a shot at you?

34:35.280 --> 34:39.510
Absolutely nothing at the moment.
So they're out there somewhere.

34:39.560 --> 34:42.429
They are.
There're not that far away.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.670
When was the last time a roadside
bomb went off on this bit,
do you know?

34:46.719 --> 34:51.320
Very... Very recent.
Very recent? Very recent.

34:57.280 --> 35:00.310
'Daylight found us
still in one piece,

35:00.360 --> 35:02.590
'and back within the walls
of Bastion,

35:02.640 --> 35:05.350
'the packing-up process could begin.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.590
'Alongside a strip-down service,

35:07.640 --> 35:11.990
'each vehicle gets a 24-hour-long
jet wash.

35:12.040 --> 35:14.390
'Biological
decontamination.

35:14.440 --> 35:18.670
'And, at the very end,
its own passport.'

35:18.720 --> 35:20.590
And look at the size of it.

35:20.640 --> 35:25.750
All these pages, all these
signatures, everything signed off.

35:25.800 --> 35:29.390
Every single vehicle and piece
of equipment has one of those.

35:29.440 --> 35:32.510
And there are over
3,500 of them.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.920
So don't complain next time
you have to tax and MOT your car.

35:41.760 --> 35:46.360
'For some poor souls,
the new machinery came too late.

35:48.920 --> 35:53.240
'But the military has responded
to the brutality of this conflict.'

36:01.880 --> 36:04.470
'And the vehicles we're
bringing home from Afghanistan

36:04.520 --> 36:07.360
'are much better than the ones
we went out with.'

36:30.080 --> 36:32.830
APPLAUSE

36:32.880 --> 36:35.470
And there it is.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.830
The big military Foxhound.

36:37.880 --> 36:42.310
Or, since the Army loves
an acronym, the big MF.

36:42.360 --> 36:47.190
Anyway, it's now time to put
an S in our RPC.

36:47.240 --> 36:51.070
Britain has produced many great
Toms over the years -

36:51.120 --> 36:54.150
Daley, Jones and, of course,
Mas the Tank Engine.

36:54.200 --> 36:58.190
But, tonight,
our Tom is the newest of them all.

36:58.240 --> 37:01.350
He's from Thor and Avengers Assemble
and War Horse.

37:01.400 --> 37:04.030
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tom Hiddleston.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.040
CHEERING

37:08.920 --> 37:12.190
How are you? Very well, thank you.

37:12.240 --> 37:15.510
Look! Thank you. Thank you.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.440
Have a seat. Thank you.

37:20.560 --> 37:25.270
I was half expecting you to ask
the audience to kneel before you.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.390
Not here.
I haven't got my horns with me.

37:27.440 --> 37:30.350
So let's get on to your car history
if I may. Yes, sure.

37:30.400 --> 37:35.000
Your first car, then, what was it?
It was a Peugeot 106. Mmm(!)

37:36.920 --> 37:42.350
Yeah. It was quite adventurous.
Mmm(!) 1.1. Wow(!)

37:42.400 --> 37:47.550
Really phwoar - when you floored it,
you felt it. It was a 1.1 what?

37:47.600 --> 37:50.720
They always had silly names. Zest.
Yeah, there you go.

37:52.480 --> 37:56.470
Sounds like a washing powder.
It sounds like lemon juice. It does.

37:56.520 --> 38:00.870
I bought it with my first
pay check for some TV work that I
got

38:00.920 --> 38:04.870
while I was at university. And I
kept that for ten years. Ten years?!

38:04.920 --> 38:07.390
Ten whole years.
All the way through my 20s, yeah.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.550
But I presume that, obviously,

38:09.600 --> 38:13.590
now, as result of you being Loki in
the Thor franchise... Indeed, yes.

38:13.640 --> 38:17.110
..there's no need now to drive
around in cars with zesty names?

38:17.160 --> 38:20.710
Well, I'm very fortunate
to drive a Jaguar.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.590
And as you probably know,

38:22.640 --> 38:26.070
I'm part of a campaign that they
have recently done. And they are...

38:26.120 --> 38:29.750
Weirdly, Jaguar's been part of my
life for the last couple of years,

38:29.800 --> 38:32.310
cos I keep playing characters
in films who drive Jaguars.

38:32.360 --> 38:33.710
What, does Loki drive a Jag?

38:33.760 --> 38:37.310
I think Loki drives a spaceship.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.350
Yes, he does. Is it a Jag spaceship?
It is a Jag, I'm sure.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.350
Goes to the petrol station and goes,

38:42.400 --> 38:45.590
"Oh, dear, my dear, I seem
to have left my wallet at home.

38:45.640 --> 38:48.510
"This is embarrassing."
I'm sure he would approve.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.430
Caddish spaceship. Yup.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.430
No, this Jag commercial, actually,
I don't know if anybody's seen it,

38:53.480 --> 38:55.190
but have a look at this.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.830
Have you ever noticed,
how, in Hollywood movies,

38:57.880 --> 38:59.630
all the villains are played
by Brits?

38:59.680 --> 39:00.990
Maybe we just sound right.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.120
Good evening, sir. Thank you, Mary.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.030
We're more focused.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.110
More precise.

39:10.160 --> 39:11.990
We're always one step ahead.

39:12.040 --> 39:15.440
With a certain style, an
eye for detail.

39:16.720 --> 39:19.400
And we're obsessed by power!

39:27.960 --> 39:31.110
A stiff upper lip is key.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.310
And we all drive Jaguars.

39:33.360 --> 39:36.470
Oh, yes. It's good to be bad.

39:36.520 --> 39:38.160
CHEERING

39:42.720 --> 39:46.230
I have to say, the line I like most
in that is Mark Strong's,

39:46.280 --> 39:49.030
cos he goes,
"And we all drive Jaguars."

39:49.080 --> 39:53.240
What it should be is, "We all drive
Jaguars...now." Right!

39:54.840 --> 39:57.790
"As a result of this."
Yeah. Or, indeed, a helicopter.

39:57.840 --> 40:00.590
Was that really filmed in London?
It was all filmed in London.

40:00.640 --> 40:03.070
It was one of the most
extraordinary evenings of my life.

40:03.120 --> 40:07.030
I... We were allowed to go over
central London about 500 feet.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.750
And the door of the helicopter
was open.

40:09.800 --> 40:13.510
And Tom Hooper, who directed it,
was sitting behind the camera.

40:13.560 --> 40:17.590
And we were up, banking right,
and I was leaning out the window,

40:17.640 --> 40:21.430
and a certain point, he said,
"I'm afraid we have to cut,
we have to change..."

40:21.480 --> 40:24.350
"OK, good, that's completely fine."
"Cut."

40:24.400 --> 40:28.310
Argh! It's really high!
You know what I mean?

40:28.360 --> 40:31.150
When the cameras rolling,
I was like, "I've got this -

40:31.200 --> 40:34.390
"more focused, more precise." And
as soon as it was cut, I was like...

40:34.440 --> 40:37.430
"Oh, God, the window's open!
Someone shut the door!"

40:37.480 --> 40:40.910
It is a good point, though. It's
a very good business, isn't it,
that is raised

40:40.960 --> 40:44.310
in that commercial about the
number of vets who are baddies.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.310
Rickman and then Hopkins and you...

40:46.360 --> 40:48.030
Alan Rickman, Anthony Hopkins...

40:48.080 --> 40:50.230
I guess it started with
James Mason back in the day.

40:50.280 --> 40:53.030
God, I thought
you were going to see James May!

40:53.080 --> 40:55.710
The world's longest
and most boring film.

40:55.760 --> 40:58.230
The undiscovered British villain.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.310
Yes.

40:59.360 --> 41:02.830
But what is it, do you think,
that the Brits bring
to a Hollywood movie?

41:02.880 --> 41:05.190
I genuinely think
it's because Americans think

41:05.240 --> 41:06.720
we're inherently distrustful.

41:08.520 --> 41:11.640
They think, "Oh, my God,
your accent! You're so sneaky!"

41:13.320 --> 41:16.470
Or something.
It's illusion, of course.

41:16.520 --> 41:19.630
They like seeing us fail, I think
that's what it is. That's it.

41:19.680 --> 41:23.710
Cos you have to fail if you're the
baddie. That's probably what it is.

41:23.760 --> 41:28.270
Now, your career began, I believe,
at Slough Comprehensive.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.910
It certainly did, yup.
As the front leg of an elephant?

41:30.960 --> 41:35.750
I was the front leg of an elephant
carrying Eddie Redmayne.

41:35.800 --> 41:38.830
He was grand enough to be the
passenger of the elephant.
Really? Yeah.

41:38.880 --> 41:41.670
I was the arse of a donkey once.

41:41.720 --> 41:44.630
And I ended up here as a result
of that. And then you did
the obligatory...

41:44.680 --> 41:47.870
The greatest arse
of a donkey...in the world.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.590
LAUGHTER

41:49.640 --> 41:51.470
CHEERING

41:51.520 --> 41:56.830
That was very good! Sorry,
couldn't help it. No, that was...

41:56.880 --> 41:59.790
Somebody said that you were a good
mimic. Is that something...?

41:59.840 --> 42:03.390
It's something I've done.
I've done it my whole life.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.510
I remember, when I was a child, they
used to have a double tape deck,

42:06.560 --> 42:09.990
and I would record my own radio
show, with all the different voices.

42:10.040 --> 42:14.230
They were basically voices of people
I'd heard of the telly, you know.

42:14.280 --> 42:19.310
Phillip Schofield's and... Could
you still do Phillip Schofield?

42:19.360 --> 42:21.990
I don't know. I don't even know
if... Actually, don't bother.

42:22.040 --> 42:26.030
I wouldn't know what he sounded
like. Throw me another one. Anthony
Hopkins.

42:26.080 --> 42:27.670
HE MIMICS: Oh, Tony Hopkins... Yeah.

42:27.720 --> 42:29.310
Have you had him on the show?
Top Gear.

42:29.360 --> 42:32.350
Yes, I'd love to be on the show. I'd
like to drive fast around a track.

42:32.400 --> 42:36.030
Being taught to drive by The Stig,
great man, great man,
I'd love to do that.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.470
LAUGHTER

42:37.520 --> 42:39.550
APPLAUSE

42:39.600 --> 42:42.070
Let's think of some more names.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.230
Anyone got any more names
we can fire?

42:44.280 --> 42:46.670
Try to make them men,
cos that's probably easier. Yeah.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.830
SOMEONE SHOUTS OUT
What? Arnold Schwarzenegger?

42:48.880 --> 42:51.350
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
SOMEONE SHOUTS OUT
What was that?

42:51.400 --> 42:54.280
Paul O'Grady.
I think I'll go for Schwarzenegger.

42:56.080 --> 42:57.830
I'm trying to think of something
he says.

42:57.880 --> 43:00.480
HE MIMICS: I know now why you cry.

43:02.520 --> 43:05.350
That sounded a little bit like
Peter O'Toole. Sorry about that.

43:05.400 --> 43:08.870
HE MIMICS O'TOOLE: I know now
you cry.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.870
That is quite a skill. Yeah.
And what are you doing now?

43:11.920 --> 43:13.510
Anything exciting?

43:13.560 --> 43:16.670
I'm just finishing
a run of Coriolanus in the West End,

43:16.720 --> 43:18.350
which I've enjoyed hugely.

43:18.400 --> 43:22.270
And I'm about to go to Toronto
to make a horror film

43:22.320 --> 43:25.510
with Guillermo del Toro...
If you know him,

43:25.560 --> 43:27.990
the Mexican director
who directed Pan's Labyrinth.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.990
Who did one with Tilda Swinton as
well just recently? That's correct.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.870
There's a film called Only Lovers
Left Alive, which is coming out

43:33.920 --> 43:38.350
in the UK, I think, on the 21st of
February, and it's basically
a love story.

43:38.400 --> 43:42.350
Tilda and I play a couple
who are vampires, so...

43:42.400 --> 43:46.710
Oh, it's about a vampire film?
It's a vampire film, but were
vegetarians, we don't bite.

43:46.760 --> 43:49.910
Vegetarian vampires. Vegetarian
vampires. This I need to see.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.870
We're much too classy for all
that 15th-century nonsense.

43:53.920 --> 43:56.870
Now, I'm conscious of the time,
cos I know that you are appearing

43:56.920 --> 44:00.150
on stage this evening...
Mm-hm.....in Coriolanus.
In Coriolanus, yes.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.070
Which calls for you at the end,
I understand,

44:02.120 --> 44:04.790
to be strung upside down,
bleeding profusely.

44:04.840 --> 44:07.190
That's how it goes down, yeah.

44:07.240 --> 44:09.310
Spoiler! Yeah.

44:09.360 --> 44:13.230
It is a 450-year-old text,
so I think it's OK.

44:13.280 --> 44:16.070
Did it occur to you when you
were driving around the track,

44:16.120 --> 44:19.190
if you had an accident,
you could save the make-up?

44:19.240 --> 44:22.430
If I just roll the car,
crash it... You could turn up...

44:22.480 --> 44:27.830
And say, "I have my 27 wounds
upon me." 27 wounds,
blood gushing...

44:27.880 --> 44:32.710
So, did you crash?
I didn't trash, per se.

44:32.760 --> 44:36.310
Because, well, shall we have a look?
Let's have a look. I'm very nervous.

44:36.360 --> 44:39.110
It was very wet out there.
Who would like to see the lap?

44:39.160 --> 44:40.870
AUDIENCE: Yes!

44:40.920 --> 44:42.510
Let's have a look. Play the tape.

44:42.560 --> 44:45.150
Three, two, one...

44:45.200 --> 44:47.510
Oh, I've stalled the BLEEP!

44:47.560 --> 44:48.790
No way!

44:48.840 --> 44:50.920
APPLAUSE

44:52.880 --> 44:57.070
Oh, the shame! Yeah, you've got
double first from Cambridge,
have you not?

44:57.120 --> 45:01.110
In Classics? I did. I did.
But you can't set off
in a Vauxhall Astra?

45:01.160 --> 45:04.910
Oh, dear. Anyway, let's see
the finished product, shall we?

45:04.960 --> 45:07.400
When you actually set off.
Right. Here we go.

45:09.720 --> 45:12.830
Ooh, that's a lot of clutch.

45:12.880 --> 45:17.400
Come on. Come on!
BLEEP. Come on!

45:18.840 --> 45:21.200
God Almighty, that's wet.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.920
Doing well, though.

45:29.440 --> 45:33.270
Go, go, go. Go, go, go, take
the bend hard, take the bend hard.

45:33.320 --> 45:34.830
Use the track.

45:34.880 --> 45:37.150
Yeah, use the track. Better.

45:37.200 --> 45:39.870
God, you've actually got
that thing sliding.

45:39.920 --> 45:43.750
Normally, it's got very good grip.
Yeah, it was very puddly out there.

45:43.800 --> 45:47.230
♪ I'm for ever driving in puddles. ♪

45:47.280 --> 45:50.310
Right, could you see
the lines at the Hammerhead?

45:50.360 --> 45:53.750
Yeah, just about, cos it was
very tight. Very difficult. Yeah.

45:53.800 --> 45:56.390
Hugh Bonneville was here last week.

45:56.440 --> 45:59.550
He said he couldn't see the lines
cos it was so wet.

45:59.600 --> 46:03.400
It's weird in England... Yeah.
..to have two wet days(!)

46:04.560 --> 46:06.470
Floor it.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.070
You're not doing it flat.

46:08.120 --> 46:09.470
Come on!

46:09.520 --> 46:12.710
You are! No, you're not.
LAUGHTER

46:12.760 --> 46:15.870
I was going to say,
that's ballsy on a day like today.

46:15.920 --> 46:17.750
Stupid but ballsy.

46:17.800 --> 46:22.790
Right. Ooh, the tail coming out.
You are very committed to this.

46:22.840 --> 46:27.630
There you go. Second to last corner.
That's very nicely done. Gambon.

46:27.680 --> 46:31.110
A bit safe, a bit safe?
No, I disagree.

46:31.160 --> 46:35.000
There we are, across the line.
APPLAUSE

46:39.320 --> 46:43.350
Now, we've only ever had one wet
lap, which was last week -
Hugh Bonneville.

46:43.400 --> 46:45.830
So where do you think you've come,
bearing that in mind?

46:45.880 --> 46:48.950
Oh, I'm a bit worried
I haven't beaten Hugh.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.870
It'd be nice to be somewhere around
that, that area.

46:51.920 --> 46:54.030
Right, somewhere around that...

46:54.080 --> 46:56.590
There's Ron Howard.
He directed Rush. He did.

46:56.640 --> 46:58.590
Ron Howard - that was dry.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.710
He was just basically hopeless.

47:00.760 --> 47:03.150
Hugh was 1.50.1.

47:03.200 --> 47:06.470
OK. And you, Tom Hiddleston,

47:06.520 --> 47:07.670
1...

47:07.720 --> 47:10.200
Which is good. That's good? OK.

47:11.680 --> 47:13.190
..40...

47:13.240 --> 47:14.830
AUDIENCE GASPS

47:14.880 --> 47:16.640
..but only just.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.590
..9.9.

47:19.640 --> 47:21.470
Oh! There we go.

47:21.520 --> 47:23.480
Well...

47:26.640 --> 47:29.150
All right. Thank you.

47:29.200 --> 47:30.710
In the wet?

47:30.760 --> 47:32.390
Very wet.

47:32.440 --> 47:35.550
Thank you! I got a V.
Special very wet.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.150
Well, I must let you go,
which is a shame

47:38.200 --> 47:40.510
because I'm much enjoying
all of this.

47:40.560 --> 47:43.440
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tom Hiddleston! Thank you.

47:49.440 --> 47:51.320
Now...

47:52.360 --> 47:59.550
..this is the brand-new
£866,000 McLaren P1,

47:59.600 --> 48:03.110
probably the most advanced
and jaw-dropping car

48:03.160 --> 48:05.190
the world has ever seen.

48:05.240 --> 48:08.830
Hmm. The attention to detail in this
thing boggles the mind.

48:08.880 --> 48:11.710
It is... It's almost science
fiction.

48:11.760 --> 48:14.750
And so, there was
only one place on Earth

48:14.800 --> 48:17.150
where I could test it properly.

48:17.200 --> 48:19.230
Belgium.

48:19.280 --> 48:20.880
LAUGHTER

48:32.200 --> 48:35.040
This is Bruges.

48:38.040 --> 48:42.510
It's a quiet, friendly,
cobbled sort of place.

48:42.560 --> 48:45.350
And it's just a stone's
throw from Brussels,

48:45.400 --> 48:48.710
home to all the environmental
EU law-makers.

48:48.760 --> 48:52.470
All of which makes it an ideal
starting point

48:52.520 --> 48:55.520
for my test of the new McLaren.

48:59.680 --> 49:05.350
Because behind the front seats
there are 324 laptop-style batteries

49:05.400 --> 49:11.000
which power a silent,
polar-bear-friendly electric motor.

49:12.840 --> 49:16.670
This means that even the most
frizzy-haired sandal enthusiast

49:16.720 --> 49:19.750
would welcome this
car into their city centre.

49:19.800 --> 49:23.790
It's like that other two-seater
electric car, the G-Wiz.

49:23.840 --> 49:27.280
It's Al Gore with
a windscreen wiper.

49:30.120 --> 49:35.040
Do not think, however, that it has
the get-up-and-go of Jabba the Hutt.

49:36.480 --> 49:39.030
Because the electric motor in this

49:39.080 --> 49:43.230
produces a whopping 176 horsepower.

49:43.280 --> 49:47.510
That's about what you
get from a Volkswagen GTI.

49:47.560 --> 49:49.520
So it's pretty nippy.

49:54.480 --> 49:58.070
The only problem is,
that after just six miles,

49:58.120 --> 50:00.230
the batteries will be flat.

50:00.280 --> 50:03.070
So you'll need to
plug your car into the mains

50:03.120 --> 50:06.550
and sit about eating a chocolate
shoe for two hours

50:06.600 --> 50:09.120
until they're charged up again.

50:12.400 --> 50:14.630
Or if this doesn't appeal,

50:14.680 --> 50:16.880
there is an alternative.

50:18.440 --> 50:22.070
Because, you see,
the P1 is fitted as standard

50:22.120 --> 50:25.790
with an onboard petrol-powered
generator.

50:25.840 --> 50:27.910
And it is quite a big one.

50:27.960 --> 50:32.550
In fact, it's
a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged

50:32.600 --> 50:36.150
722-horsepower V8.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.590
We push this button...

50:38.640 --> 50:41.070
There it is, firing up.

50:41.120 --> 50:43.190
And the great thing is,

50:43.240 --> 50:45.670
it's not just charging
the batteries.

50:45.720 --> 50:49.270
It's also working alongside
the electric motor

50:49.320 --> 50:51.200
to power the wheels.

50:53.360 --> 50:58.070
So the P1, then, is not like a G-Wiz
at all, in any way.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.390
Thanks to that generator,

51:00.440 --> 51:03.510
you can take this
out of a city centre

51:03.560 --> 51:05.680
and onto the open road.

51:15.480 --> 51:18.800
And that's another reason I've
come to Belgium.

51:19.840 --> 51:23.280
Because there are
so many roads to choose from.

51:24.600 --> 51:26.990
Belgium has three times
as many roads

51:27.040 --> 51:29.990
and 50% more cars per square mile

51:30.040 --> 51:32.590
than we do in Britain.

51:32.640 --> 51:35.990
And the stats from this
remarkable country

51:36.040 --> 51:38.000
just keep on coming.

51:39.040 --> 51:41.990
There are so many
miles of street-lit motorway here

51:42.040 --> 51:46.080
that Belgium is officially
the brightest country on Earth.

51:47.520 --> 51:50.430
It's a little-known fact that
Buzz Aldrin's first words

51:50.480 --> 51:52.670
when he set foot on the moon were,

51:52.720 --> 51:55.600
"Good God! You can
see Belgium from up here!"

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I made that up.

52:06.040 --> 52:08.680
On the road I chose, there was rain.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.520
There was sunshine.

52:14.080 --> 52:16.230
There were clear stretches.

52:16.280 --> 52:18.670
And there were traffic jams.

52:18.720 --> 52:23.480
And the McLaren was quiet
and comfortable through it all.

52:26.440 --> 52:29.880
But it was not what you'd
call luxurious.

52:31.560 --> 52:36.080
It is, frankly, as well equipped
as a pair of monk's underpants.

52:41.720 --> 52:45.350
And that's because,
like the Alfa we saw earlier,

52:45.400 --> 52:49.240
this car was designed to
be as fat as Iggy Pop.

52:50.880 --> 52:54.280
Inside, there's no glove box
and no carpets.

52:55.880 --> 52:58.550
The glass is just 3.5mm thick,

52:58.600 --> 53:02.350
1.5mm thinner than
the glass in normal cars,

53:02.400 --> 53:04.950
except in the back windows...

53:05.000 --> 53:07.390
where there's no glass at all.

53:07.440 --> 53:10.710
No lacquer is added to
carbon-fibre trim

53:10.760 --> 53:13.270
to save 1.5kg.

53:13.320 --> 53:17.240
The whole chassis weighs less
than James May.

53:18.480 --> 53:20.550
The trimmings are titanium,

53:20.600 --> 53:23.470
and the body is
made from just five panels,

53:23.520 --> 53:26.790
which means less glue
and fewer bolts are needed

53:26.840 --> 53:29.750
to hold it all together.

53:29.800 --> 53:33.790
All of this means that,
despite the bank of batteries

53:33.840 --> 53:36.110
and the fact it has two engines,

53:36.160 --> 53:39.520
this car weighs less than
a Vauxhall Astra.

53:41.440 --> 53:44.190
That, of course,
makes it economical.

53:44.240 --> 53:45.990
And fast.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.680
Really fast.

53:48.760 --> 53:50.680
Mind-blowingly fast.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.240
Oh, my God!

54:09.120 --> 54:11.750
Ohhh!

54:11.800 --> 54:14.120
HE CHUCKLES

54:15.520 --> 54:18.830
The speed, in fact,
is the main reason

54:18.880 --> 54:20.990
I brought this car to Belgium.

54:21.040 --> 54:24.560
Because Belgium is home to
this place.

54:28.280 --> 54:33.720
Spa - the longest, wildest
racetrack on the F1 calendar.

54:37.320 --> 54:40.800
How can they make something
go this fast?!

54:43.640 --> 54:47.310
OK. OK, let me
just slow it down while I explain

54:47.360 --> 54:49.390
what's going on here.

54:49.440 --> 54:52.550
The electric motor
and the big V8 generator

54:52.600 --> 54:54.630
are working together

54:54.680 --> 54:56.950
so that I have at my disposal

54:57.000 --> 55:00.320
903 brake horsepower.

55:03.360 --> 55:05.960
Ohh!

55:07.960 --> 55:10.790
Obviously, I've driven
a Bugatti Veyron

55:10.840 --> 55:12.750
that has more than that,

55:12.800 --> 55:15.120
but a Bugatti Veyron...

55:17.120 --> 55:18.710
Oh!

55:18.760 --> 55:20.910
..it has four-wheel drive

55:20.960 --> 55:23.870
and it weighs more than most
mountains.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.470
This is rear-wheel drive,

55:26.520 --> 55:29.630
and the only significant weight
comes from the air

55:29.680 --> 55:31.800
passing over the body.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.600
INDISTINCT

55:35.640 --> 55:37.750
Flat in a Formula 1 car.

55:37.800 --> 55:39.720
Not flat in this.

55:41.280 --> 55:44.840
Oh, they should have called
this the Widow-maker!

55:47.720 --> 55:50.510
The throttle is a hyperspace button.

55:50.560 --> 55:52.150
Step on it...

55:52.200 --> 55:54.120
and you're gone.

55:56.360 --> 56:00.350
And yet, somehow,
even in this appalling weather,

56:00.400 --> 56:02.870
it got round all of the corners

56:02.920 --> 56:04.830
without crashing once.

56:04.880 --> 56:06.840
So, how?

56:12.040 --> 56:17.880
Well, that's partly because it's
made of stuff from the future.

56:21.080 --> 56:23.680
And partly because it's clever.

56:25.560 --> 56:29.800
It adapts. It moves around to
suit its environment.

56:31.960 --> 56:35.230
As the speed climbs,
the rear wing rises

56:35.280 --> 56:37.190
to generate more downforce,

56:37.240 --> 56:40.150
but as you go past 156mph,

56:40.200 --> 56:43.310
it starts to go
back down a little bit,

56:43.360 --> 56:46.550
otherwise the weight of the air
passing over it

56:46.600 --> 56:49.630
would be so enormous it would
break the suspension.

56:49.680 --> 56:53.470
Then you have the exhaust,
which works with the rear diffuser

56:53.520 --> 56:56.030
to generate an area of low pressure

56:56.080 --> 56:59.550
into which the back of the car
is sucked.

56:59.600 --> 57:03.270
The wheels are made
from military-grade aluminium.

57:03.320 --> 57:06.950
The brake discs from a material
that's only ever been used

57:07.000 --> 57:09.150
in the Arianespace programme.

57:09.200 --> 57:12.310
And they're coated with something
called silicon carbide.

57:12.360 --> 57:15.790
Apparently it's the hardest
substance known to man.

57:15.840 --> 57:18.350
Apart from dried Weetabix,
obviously.

57:18.400 --> 57:20.310
And then, the whole thing

57:20.360 --> 57:25.720
sits on four tyres that were
designed and made by Pirelli.

57:26.880 --> 57:31.240
All of this means you really
have the confidence to open it up.

57:38.240 --> 57:43.070
This thing goes from 0 to 160mph

57:43.120 --> 57:46.870
faster than a Golf
goes from 0 to 60.

57:46.920 --> 57:50.070
130, 140, 150,

57:50.120 --> 57:53.750
160, 170, 180, 190...

57:53.800 --> 57:56.280
Bloody hellfire!

57:57.960 --> 58:02.430
And as you hurtle round in a puddle
of your own faeces,

58:02.480 --> 58:04.670
girning like an infant,

58:04.720 --> 58:08.640
the car is working on ways of going
even faster.

58:13.080 --> 58:15.720
Let me give you an example.

58:17.760 --> 58:20.590
The electric motor is used

58:20.640 --> 58:24.070
to fill in the little gaps
when the petrol engine

58:24.120 --> 58:26.830
isn't working at its best, like,
for example,

58:26.880 --> 58:29.550
during gear changes

58:29.600 --> 58:33.040
or while the massive
turbos are spooling up.

58:34.880 --> 58:38.190
And what I find hysterical
about that is that McLaren

58:38.240 --> 58:40.670
has taken this hybrid technology,

58:40.720 --> 58:43.790
which is designed to reduce
the impact

58:43.840 --> 58:46.190
of the internal combustion engine

58:46.240 --> 58:50.030
and is using it to increase
the impact.

58:50.080 --> 58:53.310
That's like weaponising a wind farm.

58:53.360 --> 58:58.000
Or buying the Rainbow Warrior
and turning it into an oil tanker.

59:04.760 --> 59:08.470
For years, cars have all been
basically the same

59:08.520 --> 59:11.030
but this really isn't.

59:11.080 --> 59:14.510
It's a game-changer.
A genuinely new chapter

59:14.560 --> 59:17.520
in the history of motoring.

59:18.880 --> 59:22.310
In a town, it's as eco friendly as
a health-food shop.

59:22.360 --> 59:26.270
On a motorway, it's comfortable
and produces no more carbon dioxide

59:26.320 --> 59:28.350
than a family saloon.

59:28.400 --> 59:31.750
And on a track,
it can rip a hole through time.

59:31.800 --> 59:35.910
And it's all been achieved using
something that's been around

59:35.960 --> 59:40.080
for centuries -
brilliant British engineering.

59:41.760 --> 59:44.630
You could argue
that it doesn't have

59:44.680 --> 59:46.990
the passion or
the flair of a Ferrari,

59:47.040 --> 59:49.710
and I'd probably agree with you.

59:49.760 --> 59:52.230
But look at it this way.

59:52.280 --> 59:56.030
It was passion and flair that built
the Leaning Tower of Pisa,

59:56.080 --> 59:59.070
and it was British engineering

59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.680
that built the plumb-dead-straight
Westminster Abbey.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.710
Hair on end.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.150
Great, but weren't we supposed to
test that against the hybrids

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.270
that Porsche and Ferrari are
developing? The Ferrari isn't ready.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.150
The Porsche is. It wasn't
when I filmed that. But it is now.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.670
I shall be driving it on the show
in a few weeks' time. Yes.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.590
And after you've done that,
we're going to put the Stig

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.950
in both of them and do some time
laps around our track.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.110
Now, that should be quite
something, I think.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.750
I don't think it will be. Hey?
Why not?

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.550
Well, because... Were you not
listening the film? Yeah.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.510
The speed of this is beyond
anything I've ever experienced.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.390
It's animal savagery.
It's beyond belief.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.830
Yes, yes, yes, but the Porsche might
be faster. It won't be.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.190
But it might be. No, but it won't be.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.350
But...it might be.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.870
I guarantee it won't be.
But it might be.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.590
Hammond, I'll do you a deal.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.470
If the Porsche is faster
round our track than this,

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.070
I will change my name, by deed poll,

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.150
to Jennifer.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.070
Really? Yes.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.630
Promise? Yes.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:43.910
And on that potential bombshell,
it is time to end.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:48.080
Thank you so much for watching.
See you next week. Good night!
