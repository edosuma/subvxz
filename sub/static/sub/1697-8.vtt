You know honey this used to happen to me all the time when I was on tour.

02:38.057 --> 02:42.287
And the only thing that would help is when your Momma made me stop not talk for a while.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.534
I can do that.

02:44.091 --> 02:45.534

07:29.600 --> 07:30.767
" I heart Dex"?!

07:32.220 --> 07:34.222
The last thing you want to do is over work it!

07:34.233 --> 07:36.421

Ever bring you down

07:54.218 --> 07:55.726
No, no, no!

07:55.781 --> 07:58.647
Just take a situation

07:58.705 --> 08:00.988
And turn it all around!

08:02.530 --> 08:05.776
With a new attitude,everything can change

08:05.779 --> 08:08.663
Make it how ya want it to be

08:08.949 --> 08:12.164

08:49.575 --> 08:50.706

08:56.135 --> 08:59.787
I'm sorry, Miley. But this problem is not going away on it's own. 

09:00.264 --> 09:03.895
If you ever want to sing again, I'm afraid you're going to need surgery

09:14.267 --> 09:17.943
Surgery? Really?!

09:18.101 --> 09:22.876
trust me!We're talking about a very minor operation...I could do it blind-folded!

09:22.877 --> 09:23.689
Ah!

09:24.500 --> 09:27.026
I won't!...I'm just saying that I could...

09:28.093 --> 09:30.507
Not that you'd know, you'd be out cold...

09:31.292 --> 09:32.673
Doesn't that make you feel better?

09:33.679 --> 09:34.785
It doesnt does it? 

09:35.900 --> 09:37.070
I should stop now.

09:37.999 --> 09:39.332
You think?!

09:40.327 --> 09:43.989
I'm sorry,I'm just trying to reassure you that this surgery is no big deal. 

09:44.163 --> 09:48.620
One hour in my office, one week in recovery and and you'll be as good as new.Okay?

09:48.717 --> 09:49.315
K.

09:49.316 --> 09:54.647
Really, I mean the chances of anything going wrong and you're permanently losing your singing voice are one in a million!

09:54.960 --> 09:55.597
Oh boy...

09:56.979 --> 09:59.982
One in a million?! What if I'm that one!

10:00.200 --> 10:02.309
Doc, you were this close!

10:03.000 --> 10:06.083
When I say one in a million, it's just a figure of speech. 

10:06.800 --> 10:09.074
I havent done anywhere near that many! 

10:10.523 --> 10:12.956
Not that i havent done alot... Because I have!

10:13.000 --> 10:14.624
I'm going.

10:17.379 --> 10:21.618
Daddy! There was a one and a million chance you were going to be a rockstar and that happened, 

10:21.700 --> 10:24.806
there was a one in a million chance that i'd be a popstar and that happened! 

10:25.167 --> 10:28.128
Face it£¡this family is one in a million central!

10:28.999 --> 10:34.173
Hey Mile I really think you're over reacting,this guy is one of the best surgen in the country!

10:34.180 --> 10:35.607

10:37.000 --> 10:39.277

10:39.631 --> 10:43.134
Just as the sugery is about ready to start, a meteor hits a bus, 

10:44.000 --> 10:49.510
the bus drives into a hotdog stand, a giant neon weiner flies into the power lines! 

10:49.520 --> 10:52.604
The lights go off in the surgery room and the next thing you know,

10:52.605 --> 10:57.527

11:01.100 --> 11:06.594
