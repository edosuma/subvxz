00:02.052 --> 00:03.619
- no one wants
to publish your book.

00:03.637 --> 00:05.054
- this is a big fuckin' bummer.

00:05.089 --> 00:07.456
I could really use an influx
of "cashish" right about now.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.826
- runkle,
quit beating your meat.

00:09.860 --> 00:12.061
- hank moody, sue collini.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.813
- becca's dad, right?
- yikes.

00:13.848 --> 00:14.848
- chelsea's mom?

00:14.899 --> 00:16.683
- hey, speak of the she-devils.

00:16.734 --> 00:18.184
- can i go over to chelsea's?

00:18.235 --> 00:20.320
- actually, stay for dinner.
hank moody...

00:20.354 --> 00:22.856
I'd like to introduce you
to richard bates, the writer.

00:22.907 --> 00:24.691
He's going to be
teaching here this year.

00:24.742 --> 00:26.309
- big fan.
drink with me.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.977
- ten years' sobriety
down the drain.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.579
- fuck me.
- i can't afford

00:29.613 --> 00:30.864
To keep paying rent
and mortgage

00:30.915 --> 00:32.448
At the same time, okay?

00:32.482 --> 00:34.334
I'll just--i'll move back in.
- this can't be right.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.335
- it's within his right.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.536
- oh! yes!

00:36.587 --> 00:38.588
- you're the dean
of this fine institute

00:38.622 --> 00:40.156
Of fancy book learning?
- correct.

00:40.174 --> 00:43.593
- who wants to see me talk
and do the pee-pee dance?

00:43.627 --> 00:44.594
[laughter]

00:44.628 --> 00:46.763
- let's get your clothes.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.181
- what about bates?

00:48.215 --> 00:49.516
Is he gonna be able
to do his thing?

00:49.550 --> 00:52.168
- from rehab?
i doubt it.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.836
You wouldn't happen to know

00:53.854 --> 00:56.339
Of any other
bad boy novelists

00:56.357 --> 00:59.025
Looking for a teaching gig,
would you?

00:59.059 --> 01:02.028
[rock music]

01:02.062 --> 01:04.013
? ?

01:08.485 --> 01:11.704
- [whistles]

01:13.707 --> 01:16.125
[muttering gibberish]

01:16.160 --> 01:18.461
- mm!

01:18.495 --> 01:20.029
- yes, marcy.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.998
- how are things at work,
teach?

01:22.032 --> 01:24.467
- excellent question,
cougar smurf.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.753
Aside from the fact that
i generally loathe young people,

01:26.804 --> 01:28.304
It's a pretty cush gig.

01:28.339 --> 01:30.757
- and we're keeping our hands
off the young nubiles, are we?

01:30.808 --> 01:31.841
- please.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.259
Teenage girls
are greatly overrated.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.711
Present company excepted,
of course.

01:35.729 --> 01:40.266
- of course.

01:40.317 --> 01:41.484
- are you okay over there?

01:41.518 --> 01:43.269
Are you stroking out
or something?

01:43.320 --> 01:44.487
- oh, whatever do you mean?

01:44.521 --> 01:46.189
- you're grinning
like a mongoloid.

01:46.223 --> 01:48.107
- no, i think
i'm just feeling grateful.

01:48.158 --> 01:49.558
This seems like old times,
don't it?

01:49.577 --> 01:51.327
- here we go.

01:51.362 --> 01:52.612
- truth be told,

01:52.663 --> 01:54.447
I remember the food
being a hell of a lot better.

01:54.498 --> 01:55.448
What about this steak?

01:55.499 --> 01:57.000
Tastes like prison ass.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.668
- becca. miss.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.588
You're not eating.
what's wrong with you?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.506
- nothing. i'm on a diet.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.757
- what?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.843
- hey, you are a beautiful,
young, white woman.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.261
Remember that.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.578
- you do not need
to be on a diet.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.047
- dad, i could easily
lose ten pounds.

02:11.081 --> 02:12.382
- [gasps]
your mother would kill me

02:12.416 --> 02:13.766
If you develop
an eating disorder.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.085
- i like me a big girl.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.353
Yeah, before marcy here,

02:17.388 --> 02:19.422
Most of my girlfriends
were somewhat zaftig.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.556
- yeah, i remember that.

02:20.590 --> 02:22.058
Your apartment was like
half off at lane bryant.

02:22.092 --> 02:23.443
- that's right,
that's right.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.895
Big and getable.
that's the way i liked 'em.

02:25.929 --> 02:27.930
And then old half-pint here
came along and...

02:27.948 --> 02:30.867
- oh, god. please cut
the sweet talk, will you?

02:30.901 --> 02:32.268
- [kisses]
- we're not together.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.287
We're living together.
there is a huge difference.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.772
- hey, hey. i've made
my intentions known.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.774
Love will find a way.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.209
[doorbell rings]

02:40.244 --> 02:41.961
No, no, no, no.
sit.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.047
Sit, relax, eat, enjoy.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.416
Mwah. i will get it.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.472
I'm sorry, my nubian brother.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.223
We're right in the middle
of dinner.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.842
We're not interested
this evening. ta.

02:55.893 --> 02:57.176
- not interested in what,
exactly?

02:57.227 --> 02:59.062
- whatever it is
you're selling, brother.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.597
Let me guess.
magazine subscriptions?

03:01.631 --> 03:02.631
- i'm here for marcy.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.518
- marcy? my wife?

03:05.569 --> 03:09.355
- i'm here to pick up marcy.
for our date.

03:09.406 --> 03:10.356
- hi.

03:10.407 --> 03:13.826
Thank you.

03:13.861 --> 03:18.081
- see you around,
my nubian brother.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.804
"looked up to his
centuries-old mentor.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.973
"even in the twilight
of his eternal youth,

04:17.007 --> 04:19.591
"the old man was wicked-smart

there was much to be learned

Were good for something

- i--i'm just texting
with my daughter.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.131
It's the only time she actually
acknowledges my existence.

04:58.182 --> 05:00.916
Okay, so what about
balt's story?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.102
I heard something about
vampires and frat boys and cum,

05:03.137 --> 05:04.303
So i'm half-chubbed.

05:04.354 --> 05:07.940
How about the rest
of you spoiled, rich kids?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.942
Someone?

05:09.977 --> 05:12.028
Anyone?

05:12.062 --> 05:16.065
Bueller? bueller?

05:16.099 --> 05:20.736
Bueller.
what say ye, jackie?

05:20.770 --> 05:21.871
- he's my roommate.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.623
He'll get mad at me.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.291
- maybe, but ultimately
he'll thank you

05:25.325 --> 05:28.327
For having the balls
to say something of substance.

05:28.378 --> 05:29.412
- okay.

05:29.446 --> 05:32.215
Well, i've told him
a thousand times

05:32.249 --> 05:34.133
He needs to drop
the vampire bullshit.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.635
It's stupid.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.720
You're not a fucking
creature of the night, balt.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.721
- says you, slut.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.955
- see?
what'd i tell you?

05:39.973 --> 05:41.224
- anything else?

05:41.258 --> 05:45.144
- well, uh, there was an
awful lot of talk about fucking,

05:45.179 --> 05:46.462
But no actual sex.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.730
That kind of bummed me out.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.932
- well, it is possible
that longing for something

05:49.966 --> 05:51.651
Is better than
actually having it.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.319
I've heard it said
that satisfaction

05:53.353 --> 05:55.271
Is the death of desire.

05:55.305 --> 05:57.190
- interesting.
do you need a tampon?

05:57.241 --> 05:59.242
I think i have an extra
in my purse.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.477
- ow. whoa.
look at the time already.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.645
Wow.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.113
- actually,
there's 15 minutes left.

06:04.147 --> 06:07.500
- which is why
i will leave you with this.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.318
I can't teach you how to write,

06:09.336 --> 06:11.871
And anybody who says they can
is full of shit.

06:11.922 --> 06:13.840
The only thing i can do

06:13.874 --> 06:15.374
Is write about the shit
that excites me,

06:15.425 --> 06:16.542
The shit that gets me hard.

06:16.593 --> 06:19.212
So, balt, if you want
to write about vampires

06:19.263 --> 06:21.214
Drinking each other's blood
and cum and whatnot,

06:21.265 --> 06:22.632
By all means, go for it.

06:22.666 --> 06:23.799
Write the shit out of it.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.601
Don't be niggardly
with your emotions.

06:25.636 --> 06:28.771
Just run it up the flagpole
and see who salutes, okay?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.857
Now get the fuck out of here.

06:30.891 --> 06:31.941
Go read a book or something.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.676
Preferably one of mine.

06:38.282 --> 06:39.899
- you know, i try not
to think about it too much,

06:39.950 --> 06:42.702
But i could have been t.a.-ing
for richard bates right now,

06:42.736 --> 06:44.987
And that would have been
a real education for me.

06:45.021 --> 06:47.707
I was doing my thesis on him.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.576
Yeah, and then you had to go
and knock him off the wagon.

06:50.627 --> 06:51.994
- but look how
it worked out for you.

06:52.028 --> 06:55.197
You get to learn at the feet
of a master...bator.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.216
- oh, ho. clearly.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.201
Oh, hi, felicia.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.887
- hi.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.004
How's it going, professor?

07:02.038 --> 07:05.591
- in a word? awesome.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.042
- ooh.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.678
Interesting curriculum.

07:08.712 --> 07:11.230
- ah, look at that.
i sound like a fuckin' retard.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.215
- no. don't be so hard
on yourself.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.684
But you might want to erase it

07:14.718 --> 07:16.719
Before word spreads
through these hallowed halls.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.571
Academics can be vicious.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.773
- at least i'm not
tucking my dong in class.

07:20.824 --> 07:22.742
Not with my pants off, anyway.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.278
- have you taken the sexual
harassment seminar, yet?

07:25.329 --> 07:28.948
- yeah, i had jill
take it for me online.

07:28.999 --> 07:32.752
What? what?

07:32.786 --> 07:36.255
- [sighs]
- it's like traffic school.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.210
- uh, david curran wants to know

07:41.244 --> 07:42.795
Why you gave him a "c".

07:42.846 --> 07:44.213
- okay, i'll bite.

07:44.247 --> 07:45.932
Why'd i give him a "c"?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.767
- you know, as your t.a.,

07:47.801 --> 07:49.719
I'm happy to read
the students' material

07:49.753 --> 07:51.137
And suggest a grade,

07:51.188 --> 07:54.273
But, you know, you're supposed
to read it also.

07:54.308 --> 07:57.092
- what do you think of jackie?

07:57.110 --> 07:58.527
- you think she's hot,
don't you?

07:58.562 --> 08:00.062
- i haven't thought about it.

08:00.096 --> 08:01.764
But now that i have,
yeah, she's smoking.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.616
- you're old enough
to be her father.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.202
- well, sure, i could be,
but i'm not.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.270
And i have no interest
in making sweet love to her

08:08.288 --> 08:10.456
Aside from the general interest
that all men have

08:10.490 --> 08:11.940
In making sweet love
to all women.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.126
- you know, i don't think
you can be your t.a. anymore.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.544
- i understand.
- you do?

08:15.579 --> 08:17.630
- you find me irresistible.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.966
- [chuckles]
that's close.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.450
I find you irritating.

08:21.468 --> 08:22.885
- careful.
that's how it starts.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.220
The mother
of my problem child

08:24.254 --> 08:25.588
Would say
the exact same thing.

08:25.622 --> 08:27.122
Seriously. watch it.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.891
- has a woman ever
punched you in the face?

08:28.925 --> 08:31.143
- you know what?
you should use me.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.144
- really?
- mm-hmm.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.346
- mm-hmm.
i should use you.

08:33.397 --> 08:35.130
I'm--i'm frightened.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.683
- as consultant in your search
for worthy companionship.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.135
- i, hank moody,
and a prime example

08:40.153 --> 08:41.821
Of how the male noggin works.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.972
You know, say you're out
on a date with some dick,

08:43.991 --> 08:45.691
He does something
you can't quite decipher,

08:45.742 --> 08:46.942
You call me up,

08:46.976 --> 08:49.578
I'll tell you what it meant.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.415
- thanks, dick.
that's a great idea.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.083
I'm gonna think about it
while i'm peeing.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.868
- tinkle, tinkle.

08:55.919 --> 08:57.086
[knock at door]

08:57.120 --> 08:58.621
- professor moody,

08:58.655 --> 08:59.955
Uh, can i have a word?

08:59.989 --> 09:01.507
- i suppose so,
but i was thinking

09:01.541 --> 09:03.992
Of ducking out
and catching a movie.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.428
But i guess not.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.013
Office hours and whatnot.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.597
Come in. have a seat.

09:08.632 --> 09:11.333
Call me hank.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.334
- thank you, hank.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.469
- i changed my mind.

09:13.503 --> 09:15.771
Call me professor moody.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.223
I'm just fucking with you.

09:17.274 --> 09:20.693
Not really.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.228
What do you want?

09:22.279 --> 09:24.030
- look, i need to know...

09:24.064 --> 09:25.064
If i'm a writer.

09:25.115 --> 09:26.065
- mm.

09:26.116 --> 09:27.650
Jesus christ, kid.

09:27.684 --> 09:28.684
Who am i to tell you that?

09:28.702 --> 09:30.069
- well, you're my teacher.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.154
I respect you, and i think
you're an awesome writer.

09:32.188 --> 09:33.706
- thank you.
- i've read all your books.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.157
Cover to cover.

09:35.191 --> 09:36.909
I love your picture
on the back, by the way.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.044
It's very handsome.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.745
- thank...you.

09:39.796 --> 09:43.549
- you're the mentor, you know?
in my story?

09:43.583 --> 09:48.537
The young vampire
has a crush on the old one.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.756
It's you. it's a metaphor.

09:50.807 --> 09:53.392
- i'm the old vampire.
fantastic.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.979
- come on, hank--
professor moody.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.214
Brutal truth.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.434
I can take it.

10:01.485 --> 10:03.102
- brutal truth, huh?

10:03.153 --> 10:05.604
- mm-hmm. absolutely.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.526
- your story was bad.

10:10.560 --> 10:11.994
It was terrible, in fact.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.997
<i>it was like that lame
twilight bullshit.</i>

10:15.031 --> 10:16.582
I have no patience
for that crap.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.501
It's not writing.
it's like bound toilet paper.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.252
Now i'm not saying
you won't get better

10:20.287 --> 10:21.754
If you keep writing,
because you will.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.089
No question.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.240
But i am saying
that if you can do anything else

10:25.258 --> 10:26.258
With your life right now,

10:26.293 --> 10:28.043
Anything at all,

10:28.077 --> 10:29.962
I think maybe
you should do that.

10:30.013 --> 10:32.715
'cause the world doesn't need
anymore lame vampire fiction.

10:32.749 --> 10:35.751
You know what i'm saying?

10:35.769 --> 10:38.053
You with me, amigo?

10:38.087 --> 10:39.939
- i think so.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.108
- brutal truth, right?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.977
- uh, right.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.601
- teaching's not so hard.

10:52.619 --> 10:56.906
I feel bad.
he was clearly crushing on me.

10:56.940 --> 10:58.440
Maybe i led him on.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.075
- hmm? how so?

11:00.109 --> 11:02.411
- i don't know.
maybe i was sending out signals.

11:02.445 --> 11:03.746
Fuck. maybe i'm gay.

11:03.780 --> 11:05.214
- hank, please.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.465
We're all gay.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.616
- what the? what the?

11:07.634 --> 11:08.918
- i'm serious.

11:08.952 --> 11:10.136
- yeah, i know,
and it scares me.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.670
- all right,
let me put it this way.

11:11.721 --> 11:13.923
If you and i were trapped
together on a desert island--

11:13.957 --> 11:15.841
- i don't like
where this is going already.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.143
- it would only be
a matter of time

11:17.177 --> 11:18.727
Before i was putting it
in your pooper.

11:18.762 --> 11:19.929
- hey, i may be easy,

11:19.963 --> 11:21.129
But i am not sleazy.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.065
Besides, i don't really
see myself as a bottom.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.633
- fine.
you put it in my pooper.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.819
- my fist, maybe.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.571
- whatever floats your boat.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.407
My point being,
we're just animals.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.408
- perhaps, but this animal

11:32.442 --> 11:33.859
Prefers the warm,
cozy confines

11:33.910 --> 11:35.077
Of the female vagina.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.145
- but faced with a severe
vaginal drought,

11:37.164 --> 11:38.364
Men will be men.

11:38.415 --> 11:39.865
Boys will do boys.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.668
- you've given this a fair
amount of thought, haven't you?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.954
- it's like when
you were a kid, okay?

11:44.988 --> 11:46.005
You know what i'm saying?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.706
- no, i do not.

11:47.757 --> 11:50.876
- we've all got a gay experience
or two in our back pockets.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.044
- oh, okay. all right.

11:52.095 --> 11:53.462
Now--now i see
where you're going.

11:53.496 --> 11:55.431
Okay. what's yours?

11:55.465 --> 11:57.383
- oh, oh, no, no, no.
you first.

11:57.434 --> 11:59.635
- no way.
bald before beauty.

11:59.669 --> 12:01.437
- all right.
you know? fine. okay.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.055
So when i was growing up,

12:03.106 --> 12:04.557
My best friend
was mike metz.

12:04.608 --> 12:05.641
- uh-huh. mike metz.

12:05.675 --> 12:08.677
- okay, sometimes
we would undress,

12:08.695 --> 12:10.345
We'd lay down on the bed,

12:10.363 --> 12:13.515
And just, you know,
touch each other's bodies.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.034
It wasn't gay.
- sure.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.368
- it wasn't even sexual.
- mm-hmm.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.370
- it was, you know,
very loving, act--

12:18.405 --> 12:20.072
It was just an expression
of our friendship.

12:20.123 --> 12:21.657
- mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- that's all.

12:21.691 --> 12:23.242
- well, that's interesting,
because you and i are friends,

12:23.293 --> 12:24.460
And yet you've never asked me

12:24.494 --> 12:25.744
To get undressed
and touch your body.

12:25.795 --> 12:29.915
- so what's yours, big boy?

12:29.966 --> 12:32.167
You tricked me, didn't you?

12:32.201 --> 12:33.702
You miserable fucking bastard.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.370
You keep that one
close to your vest, okay?

12:35.388 --> 12:37.673
- of course.
of course.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.887
- oh, jesus.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.689
You're gonna rape me,
aren't you?

12:53.723 --> 12:55.441
- oh, you bet your sweet ass,
rich white lady.

12:55.492 --> 12:56.442
- i'm not rich!

12:56.493 --> 12:57.993
- bullshit!
you own salon.

12:58.028 --> 12:58.994
Don't lie to me.

12:59.029 --> 12:59.995
- oh, my god.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.447
Put that thing away.

13:01.498 --> 13:04.533
That big, thick,
purple thing!

13:04.567 --> 13:06.068
- that's right.
you better recognize.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.453
This here's a one-eyed,
one-horned,

13:07.504 --> 13:08.871
Flying, purple,
white-woman eater.

13:08.905 --> 13:10.072
- oh!

13:10.090 --> 13:11.540
- and i'm gonna split you
like wet pine.

13:11.574 --> 13:12.574
- oh, yeah.

13:12.592 --> 13:16.545
Oh, yeah.
- [grunts]

13:16.579 --> 13:18.430
- no means no, you know?
- charlie!

13:18.465 --> 13:20.716
- this the surprise
you were talking about?

13:20.750 --> 13:21.800
- what the fuck are you doing?

13:21.851 --> 13:23.269
- what does it look like
i'm doing?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.271
I'm saving you.
- saving me? i'm fine!

13:25.305 --> 13:26.605
- no, you're not fine.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.774
You're being raped.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.644
- i am not!

13:31.695 --> 13:35.597
- you were too.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.099
- we're playing a game.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.567
- a game?

13:38.601 --> 13:40.286
What kind of game?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.821
Some kind of sick, twisted,
plantation-days kind of thing?

13:42.872 --> 13:43.822
- hey.

13:43.873 --> 13:45.107
Watch it, motherfucker.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.326
- it was a fantasy, charlie.

13:47.377 --> 13:49.211
- a fantasy?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.913
- a rape fantasy.

13:50.947 --> 13:52.798
- a rape fanta--?

13:52.832 --> 13:53.916
That is just sick, marcy.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.334
- sick?

13:55.385 --> 13:57.119
I'm sick?

13:57.137 --> 14:00.122
After all the twisted,
depraved shit

14:00.140 --> 14:02.591
I've seen you do?

14:02.625 --> 14:05.811
Don't you dare
judge me, motherfucker.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.513
- oh, god.

14:07.564 --> 14:08.797
I think i'm gonna puke.

14:08.815 --> 14:12.151
- good!

14:19.409 --> 14:21.026
- dean koons wants to see you.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.862
- [coughs]
hit?

14:23.913 --> 14:25.647
- i'm good.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.786
- hey, guys.

14:30.820 --> 14:32.004
Thank you.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.822
Thank you.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.708
- for what?

14:35.759 --> 14:37.042
- i heard
you wanted to see me,

14:37.093 --> 14:39.094
Which could only mean
you wanted to congratulate me

14:39.129 --> 14:40.512
For the kickass job
i've been doing,

14:40.547 --> 14:43.665
So i just wanted to say
you're welcome.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.718
It's been my pleasure.

14:45.769 --> 14:47.335
- this is no time
to be glib, hank.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.355
- how can you be sure?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.106
- i'll handle this, stacy.

14:51.141 --> 14:53.341
There's been an incident.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.526
- okay, well, look.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.179
"niggardly"
is not a racial slur.

14:57.197 --> 15:00.532
And in fact, one might say
that y'all have been niggardly

15:00.567 --> 15:03.452
<i>when it comes to financial
compensation pour moi.</i>

15:03.486 --> 15:05.070
I'm just saying.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.188
- are you done handling this?

15:06.206 --> 15:07.189
Because we are dealing

15:07.207 --> 15:08.356
With an idiot man-child here.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.627
- "oh, me love her too much.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.078
"me pet her too hard.

15:13.129 --> 15:16.081
She no wake up."

15:16.132 --> 15:20.419
[groaning]

15:20.470 --> 15:23.756
- a student of yours tried
to commit suicide last night.

15:26.375 --> 15:29.762
- shitness. wow. who?

15:29.813 --> 15:30.896
- chris smith.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.598
- chris smith?

15:32.649 --> 15:34.183
Chris smith.

15:34.217 --> 15:36.568
Ah, he's not one of mine.
thank god.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.153
- no, his friends
call him balt.

15:38.188 --> 15:41.440
- balt?
fuck, i know that dude.

15:41.491 --> 15:43.609
- did he seem
despondent at all?

15:43.660 --> 15:45.160
- more importantly,
his roommate said

15:45.195 --> 15:46.912
He had just returned
from a meeting with you.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.998
- he did stop by...
my office-es.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.618
- well, what was discussed?

15:52.669 --> 15:56.839
- life...love...
vampires and shit.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.240
- we're not
attacking you, hank.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.591
We're just trying to work out
what happened.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.959
- feels like you're attacking.

16:01.010 --> 16:02.261
- it's pretty clear
what happened.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.745
- stop being
so condescending, stacy.

16:03.763 --> 16:04.746
- look, why don't you just

16:04.764 --> 16:06.298
Tender your resignation
right now.

16:06.349 --> 16:08.767
Spare us the trouble
of an investigation.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.185
- you want to handle this,
stacy?

16:10.220 --> 16:11.687
Fine. go right ahead.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.422
Just leave me out of it.

16:16.776 --> 16:20.028
- someone's sleeping
on the couch tonight.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.530
Good jelly beans.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.782
- look, hank,

16:23.817 --> 16:25.951
I know you're not exactly

16:25.985 --> 16:29.154
What anyone would call
an education professional.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.707
Or a professional of any kind,
for that matter.

16:31.741 --> 16:35.127
But my wife went out
on a limb for you.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.295
She loves becca.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.046
She thought it would be nice
if her father

16:38.081 --> 16:39.298
Was gainfully employed.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.500
- [imitates popeye]
ah gah gah gah gah gah!

16:41.551 --> 16:43.836
- that being said--
- gah gah gah!

16:43.887 --> 16:46.621
- that's an antique.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.424
If i find out
that you said or did anything

16:49.458 --> 16:50.926
To push that poor kid
over the edge,

16:50.960 --> 16:52.227
I'm gonna make it my life's work

16:52.262 --> 16:53.461
To make sure
you never step foot

16:53.480 --> 16:54.462
On this campus again.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.732
Do you understand me?

16:56.766 --> 16:59.351
Do i have your ear, hank?

16:59.402 --> 17:01.636
- you have
beautiful, blue eyes.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.859
- are you high?

17:07.911 --> 17:12.146
- i gotta run.
talk to you later.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.316
- [sighs]

17:14.334 --> 17:18.252
- all work and no ass-play
makes chuck a dull boy.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.655
- just trying
to earn my keep, sue.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.825
- what do you say the two of us
knock off early, huh?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.511
Slip out of this
business casual,

17:25.545 --> 17:26.962
Nude-up in my "jacooze",

17:26.996 --> 17:29.214
See what kind of sodomy laws
we can break?

17:29.265 --> 17:32.518
- sounds like the height
of decadence, sue.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.836
But i should probably
get through this slush pile.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.889
Who knows? i might even
find something good.

17:36.940 --> 17:38.340
- who knows?

17:38.358 --> 17:39.691
You might find something better

17:39.726 --> 17:41.059
In my punani.

17:41.110 --> 17:42.611
- yeah.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.180
Warren beatty's
lost rolex, maybe.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.949
- [laughs]

17:46.983 --> 17:50.352
Oh, you are a dirty dog.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.870
I like your style, runkle.

17:51.905 --> 17:56.691
- hey, can i ask you
a question, sue?

17:56.709 --> 17:58.193
- the answer's yes.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.878
I would love a face-ride.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.364
- seriously,

18:02.382 --> 18:06.301
Do women ever fantasize

18:06.336 --> 18:09.254
About...being raped?

18:09.305 --> 18:12.207
- are you trying to get me wet?

18:12.225 --> 18:15.143
- i don't think so.
- yes, charlie.

18:15.178 --> 18:18.063
Women fantasize about rape.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.398
- really?
- mm-hmm.

18:19.432 --> 18:25.220
And my own features
a handsome stranger.

18:25.238 --> 18:30.659
<i>think jack, circa
the postman always rings twice,</i>

18:30.693 --> 18:34.396
Sneaking into my bedroom
and taking me in my sleep.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.531
He pulls down my panties.

18:36.565 --> 18:38.784
He enters slowly.

18:38.835 --> 18:40.902
Slips right in.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.622
Oh, jack.
the pussy never lies.

18:43.673 --> 18:44.790
Remember that, runkle.

18:44.841 --> 18:47.075
I kick, i scream,
but it's too late.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.011
I mean,
the juices are flowing.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.596
The train
has left the station.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.633
We are headed for a big,
fat, rocky orgasm.

18:54.684 --> 18:57.752
Oh, sweet jesus, guide me.

19:04.227 --> 19:05.978
Are you trying to tell me
something, runkle?

19:06.029 --> 19:09.597
Are you thinking
about some role playing?

19:09.616 --> 19:11.533
Because you name the game,

19:11.567 --> 19:12.767
I'll play the part.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.486
And i'm good at it.

19:14.537 --> 19:17.239
I used to run lines
with margot kidder.

19:17.273 --> 19:19.658
Before she went apeshit.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.326
Try me sometime.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.169
- [clears throat]

19:31.220 --> 19:32.838
- wow. look who's here.

19:32.889 --> 19:34.289
What's up, asshole?

19:34.307 --> 19:36.308
- that's no way to address
your teacher, young lady.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.477
- is that what you are?
a teacher?

19:38.511 --> 19:41.346
I was thinking more like
a destroyer of hopes and dreams.

19:41.397 --> 19:42.514
- is he gonna be okay?

19:42.565 --> 19:43.649
- maybe if you put

19:43.683 --> 19:45.767
Your fuckin' cigarette out.

19:45.801 --> 19:47.019
He's fine.

19:47.070 --> 19:48.270
He got depressed

19:48.304 --> 19:50.138
And he drank all the cold
medicine he could find.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.524
He's such a fuckin' queen.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.030
- you came.

19:58.081 --> 19:59.831
- 'course i did, buddy.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.583
How you doing?

20:01.617 --> 20:03.418
- i hate myself,
and i want to fucking die.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.537
- oh, been there.

20:05.588 --> 20:06.538
- i doubt it.

20:06.589 --> 20:07.655
What could you possibly know

20:07.674 --> 20:08.990
About being
a fucked-up gay kid?

20:09.008 --> 20:11.710
- we're all...gay.

20:11.761 --> 20:14.829
In--in some form or another.

20:14.847 --> 20:19.685
We've all had a gay experience
in our past or two.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.852
- you too?

20:20.887 --> 20:21.887
- oh, hells yeah.

20:21.938 --> 20:24.056
- tell me about it.

20:27.610 --> 20:31.113
- well, when i was a--
when i was a kid,

20:31.147 --> 20:34.349
Barely a teenager,

20:34.367 --> 20:37.119
My best friend and i,
mike metz,

20:37.153 --> 20:41.540
Yeah, we would, uh,
we'd get undressed....

20:41.574 --> 20:45.494
- d-don't stop.

20:45.528 --> 20:49.498
- right.
and, um, you know,

20:49.532 --> 20:52.584
We would--we would
lay in bed together...

20:52.635 --> 20:54.503
Naked, um,

20:54.537 --> 20:57.889
Touching each other's...

20:57.924 --> 20:59.758
Naked bodies.

20:59.809 --> 21:01.977
You know, just--
and--and it wasn't, like,

21:02.011 --> 21:04.546
Uh, sexual or gay,

21:04.564 --> 21:06.732
But just more of a...

21:06.766 --> 21:11.686
More of an expression
of our profound friendship.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.072
- see, i don't know.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.908
It sounds
pretty fucking gay to me.

21:16.943 --> 21:20.779
- it does sound gay.

21:20.830 --> 21:22.397
You know what?

21:22.415 --> 21:24.232
I'm sorry if i bummed you out.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.868
But you got to cut me
some slack here.

21:26.902 --> 21:28.420
I'm pretty new
to this teaching thing.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.072
I don't know
what the fuck i'm doing.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.741
You know what i dug
about your story?

21:33.760 --> 21:35.127
There was one line i loved.

21:35.178 --> 21:37.796
Um, "the twilight
of his eternal youth."

21:37.847 --> 21:40.582
Really dug that.
stuck in my head.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.968
- i polished that one
for a while, actually.

21:43.019 --> 21:45.470
- mm. polish it.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.140
- well, shit.
i gotta get to work.

21:48.191 --> 21:50.091
You think you could
stay with him for a little bit?

21:50.109 --> 21:53.061
- oh, no, i have, uh--

21:53.095 --> 21:55.763
I got to--
i got to run too, so...

21:58.201 --> 22:00.268
Yeah, i can.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.204
- no. you know what
you can do for me?

22:02.238 --> 22:03.622
- what?

22:03.656 --> 22:05.791
- give her a ride.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.542
She took the bus
all the way here.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.377
God knows
she's too hot for that.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.663
I wouldn't want her
getting raped on my account.

22:11.714 --> 22:13.948
- that would be
most unfortunate.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.918
- come with me.
my rape-proof chariot awaits.

22:16.952 --> 22:17.919
Later, pale skin.

22:17.953 --> 22:18.920
I hope you feel better.

22:18.954 --> 22:20.955
Keep scribbling.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.558
- no kiss goodnight?
- oh.

22:26.395 --> 22:29.014
- bye, honey.

22:46.115 --> 22:49.084
[sensuous music]

22:49.118 --> 22:57.125
? ?

23:38.501 --> 23:41.086
- huh?! charlie!

23:41.137 --> 23:42.870
What the fuck are you doing?

23:42.889 --> 23:44.205
- what does it look like
i'm doing?

23:44.223 --> 23:45.223
I'm raping you.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.592
- get off me,
you fucking asshole!

23:47.643 --> 23:48.593
- do you love it?

23:48.644 --> 23:50.729
- no! stop it now!

23:50.763 --> 23:51.730
- because i love it.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.598
This is so not consensual.

23:53.649 --> 23:56.935
[punch]
- oh! ow! ow.

23:56.986 --> 23:59.271
Ow. ow.

23:59.322 --> 24:02.056
Ow.

24:02.074 --> 24:04.109
Fuck.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.060
- what are you thinking?

24:06.078 --> 24:08.580
- guess i thought it was
something you might enjoy.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.615
You know, and maybe
in the middle you'd be like,

24:10.666 --> 24:12.751
"god, i really do love
this schmuck."

24:12.785 --> 24:15.003
- you thought that
in the middle of raping me

24:15.037 --> 24:16.738
I'd realize how much
i love you?!

24:16.756 --> 24:18.840
- something like that.

24:18.874 --> 24:22.844
Yeah. but it sounded
a lot better the way i said it.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.879
And, just to be fair,
you know,

24:24.913 --> 24:26.598
<i>it was a rape fantasy.</i>

24:26.632 --> 24:28.300
- for you, maybe.

24:28.351 --> 24:30.352
- okay.

24:30.386 --> 24:33.388
Well, i'm sorry
for the misunderstanding.

24:33.422 --> 24:34.389
My bad.

24:38.527 --> 24:41.947
Sorry. these are yours.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.482
[sighs]

24:44.533 --> 24:47.485
[rock music]

24:47.536 --> 24:55.043
? ?

24:55.077 --> 24:56.277
- this is where you work?

24:56.295 --> 24:57.379
- yup.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.080
- but you just work
the front desk

24:59.114 --> 25:01.132
Or you're the cashier
or something like that, right?

25:01.167 --> 25:03.117
- something like that.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.469
- interesting.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.120
- you want to come inside?

25:06.138 --> 25:07.455
Maybe wet your whistle?

25:07.473 --> 25:09.841
- would that involve
seeing you naked?

25:09.892 --> 25:10.842
- oh, most definitely.

25:10.893 --> 25:12.844
- then, no offense,
but i think not.

25:12.895 --> 25:14.679
In the interest of
student-teacher relations.

25:14.730 --> 25:17.277
- wow. look at you
with the moral rectitude.

25:17.311 --> 25:18.278
I'm impressed.

25:18.312 --> 25:19.862
- i know. me too.

25:19.897 --> 25:20.947
- thanks for the ride, prof.

25:20.981 --> 25:21.948
- any time.

25:21.982 --> 25:23.566
Well, you know,
not--not any time.

25:23.617 --> 25:25.702
I don't think this is the best
habit to get into.

25:25.736 --> 25:26.852
- you were right, you know?

25:26.870 --> 25:28.538
He's a shitty writer.

25:28.572 --> 25:30.356
Someone had to tell him.

25:30.374 --> 25:32.125
You know,
parents tell their kids

25:32.159 --> 25:34.294
They can be anything
they want when they grow up.

25:34.328 --> 25:35.295
But it's not true.

25:35.329 --> 25:36.746
Not for everyone.

25:36.797 --> 25:38.498
Sometimes that can fuck you up

25:38.532 --> 25:39.882
A lot more than
someone telling you

25:39.917 --> 25:42.302
You can't do a goddamn thing.

25:42.336 --> 25:46.038
Besides, you can't really
teach writing, can you?

25:46.056 --> 25:47.707
- you're a smart kid.
you know that?

25:47.725 --> 25:49.976
- damn straight.

25:50.010 --> 25:52.895
All right, i got to go shake
my money-makers.

25:52.930 --> 25:54.547
- okay.
- have a good night.

25:54.565 --> 25:56.099
- you have a good night too.

25:56.150 --> 25:59.552
I hope you get, uh,
lots of singles...i guess.

25:59.570 --> 26:02.155
Or fives, or...
- all right.

26:02.189 --> 26:03.156
- benjamins? i don't know.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.774
- bye.
- bye.

26:14.752 --> 26:16.252
Hey, where are you going,
short stuff?

26:16.286 --> 26:18.838
- out.
- out, you say?

26:18.872 --> 26:19.839
Out where?

26:19.873 --> 26:20.840
- just out.

26:20.874 --> 26:22.125
- just out?

26:22.176 --> 26:23.576
I'm not familiar
with that area.

26:23.594 --> 26:25.578
- the promenade.
i'm meeting chelsea.

26:25.596 --> 26:28.931
- oh, not so fast.
how you gonna get there?

26:28.966 --> 26:31.851
- i don't know.
i'll walk or take the bus.

26:31.885 --> 26:32.918
- did you even think to ask?

26:32.936 --> 26:35.054
- i didn't think you'd care.

26:35.088 --> 26:37.357
- well, sorry, honey.
looks like i do.

26:37.391 --> 26:38.358
- okay, good to know.

26:38.392 --> 26:40.443
So can i go?
- no.

26:40.477 --> 26:42.094
Why don't you stay in
with me tonight?

26:42.112 --> 26:44.147
You know, we'll--
we'll watch a movie.

26:44.198 --> 26:45.531
Pop some corn.

26:45.566 --> 26:47.099
The promenade
will always be there.

26:47.117 --> 26:48.568
Unfortunately.

26:48.602 --> 26:49.952
- yeah,
sounds like a good time,

26:49.987 --> 26:51.654
But i think i'd rather go out.

26:51.705 --> 26:53.790
- well, i--i think i'd rather
have you stay home.

26:53.824 --> 26:54.907
How 'bout that?

26:54.941 --> 26:57.660
- got it. loud and clear.
so can i go?

26:57.711 --> 27:00.380
- asked and answered, becca.
- why?

27:00.414 --> 27:03.249
- because i said so.
- because you said so?

27:03.283 --> 27:06.452
- because i said so.
- jesus.

27:06.470 --> 27:08.921
- who are you texting?
- chelsea.

27:08.955 --> 27:10.757
To tell her you're being
a total dick right now.

27:10.791 --> 27:12.341
- what is going on with you?

27:12.393 --> 27:14.761
When did you become
such a little snot?

27:14.795 --> 27:16.095
That is not funny, becca.

27:16.129 --> 27:18.898
- it's funny to me.

27:23.487 --> 27:24.604
[glass shatters]

27:24.638 --> 27:26.355
- i fucking hate you!

27:26.407 --> 27:28.024
- yeah,
