00:13.040 --> 00:14.119
Oh, my God,

00:14.120 --> 00:15.519
I want to show you something.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.260
Oh. That is fine work, my brother.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.960
We used to do it all the
time, my mother and me.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.820
I mean, Christmas was the only
time that I could be myself,

00:25.860 --> 00:28.330
with all the fun colors and clothes.

00:28.430 --> 00:31.660
I played Melchior in the church
nativity play, and my mom

00:31.740 --> 00:33.980
took me to Jo-Ann's to buy fabric

00:34.040 --> 00:36.420
for this big, gold robe that
I would wear in the show.

00:36.460 --> 00:37.710
I mean, even my dad,

00:37.810 --> 00:40.540
when I came out of my bedroom

00:40.640 --> 00:41.780
to show him...

00:43.910 --> 00:45.850
... he laughed.

00:45.950 --> 00:49.980
I mean, any other day and he
would've taken off his belt.

00:50.740 --> 00:52.099
Well, in this house,

00:52.100 --> 00:53.989
you can be the king of Arabia

00:53.990 --> 00:56.480
and wear golden robes
every day of the year.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.599
All right, now, come on, children.
Gather around.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.520
We got another tradition
starting this Christmas.

01:02.700 --> 01:05.300
All of y'all get to ask
your mother for one thing

01:05.319 --> 01:07.400
she can put under the
tree for y'all to open

01:07.500 --> 01:08.879
on Christmas morning.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.019
Within reason, all right?

01:11.020 --> 01:12.939
Don't go asking me for no damn Subaru.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.880
- I-I want...
- Uh-uh-uh. I want

01:14.900 --> 01:18.260
python high-top sneakers
with the snakeskin.

01:18.340 --> 01:19.790
You can't yell it out like that,

01:19.820 --> 01:21.216
- like we on The Price is Right.
- Mm-hmm.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.320
You need to write a note
to your Mother Santa,

01:23.380 --> 01:25.790
put it under the tree so she can find.

01:25.890 --> 01:27.260
- Angel.
- Hmm?

01:27.320 --> 01:28.860
Please write your note.

01:30.860 --> 01:33.460
I told you I didn't want
anything for Christmas.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.660
It's Christmas. I mean,

01:34.770 --> 01:36.870
everybody wants something, right?

01:45.260 --> 01:47.080
When I was six years old,

01:48.160 --> 01:50.260
my father took me with him
to the department store

01:50.300 --> 01:52.120
to buy some Christmas presents.

01:52.620 --> 01:54.519
I saw this one pair of

01:54.520 --> 01:57.400
red pumps with a four-inch heel.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.040
I swear to God,

02:04.080 --> 02:07.700
I had never seen anything quite
so beautiful in my entire life.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.139
When no one was looking,

02:10.280 --> 02:11.770
I took one,

02:11.870 --> 02:13.600
snuck it home,

02:13.700 --> 02:16.560
hidden underneath my coat.

02:16.580 --> 02:18.540
When we got to the apartment,

02:18.740 --> 02:20.820
I tried running straight to my room.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.280
It slipped out and fell onto the floor,

02:24.400 --> 02:26.580
right in front of my
mother and my father.

02:28.980 --> 02:31.600
I begged them to let me keep it.

02:37.530 --> 02:39.140
My father s...

02:41.040 --> 02:44.280
my father slapped me across the face.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.800
For stealing.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.400
But more so for what I chose to steal.

02:57.820 --> 03:00.480
I mean, what kind of little boy

03:00.500 --> 03:03.640
cries over a patent
leather red pump, right?

03:07.240 --> 03:09.340
He treated me different after that.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.690
If she doesn't want a
present, can I have hers?

03:29.700 --> 03:30.700
No.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.949
- Boy.
- What?

03:31.950 --> 03:34.820
- Finish puttin' these corns to poppin'.
- Why you... Look at this.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.930
- Don't be clownin' my stuff, all right?
- Yeah, but it look crazy.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.800
- No, but it look good though.
- Finish the corn that pops, honey.

03:38.820 --> 03:40.570
Man, what you talking about?
You seen your beads?

03:40.590 --> 03:42.180
- They look great.
- They look foo-foo.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.770
The category is...

03:52.060 --> 03:54.300
Live...

03:54.940 --> 03:56.520
Work...

03:56.840 --> 03:59.220

Best Dressed High Class

04:31.350 --> 04:33.960
Mink, chinchilla.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.360
Come on, butch queens.

04:35.460 --> 04:39.080
I better see Bugs Bunny
on your goddamn back!

04:39.140 --> 04:41.400
The temperature is dropping here...

04:41.500 --> 04:43.500
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.900
I can't compete with them.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.816
If you want to be in the
house of Evangelista,

04:46.840 --> 04:48.400
you gotta compete.

04:49.510 --> 04:51.000
Do it for us.

04:53.380 --> 04:57.960
Ooh, giving us Ralph Lauren in tails.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.480
A little tail ain't never
hurt nobody, baby.

05:01.580 --> 05:03.100
Judges, your scores, please.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.120
Eight, seven, eight,

05:05.220 --> 05:07.220
six and seven.

05:09.460 --> 05:12.000
- Okay.
- No.

05:18.780 --> 05:20.100
And what have we here?

05:20.140 --> 05:22.840
Looking like a grape raccoon.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.470
That fur better not touch the ground.

05:27.580 --> 05:30.860
Oh... The lining.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.999
The lining is the only thing

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
to touch the ground, my darling.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.800
That is how it is done.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.860
Ah, judges, your scores.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.540
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

05:45.230 --> 05:47.060
Midnight Pimping.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.880
Looky here. Don't run into this one

05:50.900 --> 05:52.620
in a dark alley, baby.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.220
Yeah, there we have it.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.440
Who's coming next?

06:04.480 --> 06:06.310
Oh, my.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.179
And is this Billy Dee
Williams we have here...

06:13.180 --> 06:15.060
in lynx?

06:15.940 --> 06:17.800
Serving us butch.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.939
Serving us masculintity.

06:20.940 --> 06:22.100
Go, Ricky!

06:22.160 --> 06:24.560
You love it. You long for it.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.700
I'm having all of it.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.779
Your scores, judges, please, please.

06:28.780 --> 06:32.120
Ten, ten, nine, ten, nine.

06:32.140 --> 06:33.539
Whoo, Ricky!

06:35.120 --> 06:37.040
First runner-up...

06:37.100 --> 06:39.350
Mr. Billy Dee Williams
in the white lynx.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.940
I commend you on your ballroom debut.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.590
All right, all right, I know it's time

06:56.600 --> 06:58.446
for all of y'all to collect
your trophies and go home,

06:58.470 --> 07:00.159
but before you do,

07:00.160 --> 07:02.500
house mothers and fathers,

07:02.570 --> 07:04.439
sound the call across the land

07:04.440 --> 07:07.600
that our next event is gonna
be the biggest of the year...

07:07.720 --> 07:10.080
The Snow Ball, right?

07:10.340 --> 07:13.440
And I expect to see you all
there in your holiday best.

07:14.550 --> 07:16.080
Good night.

07:16.140 --> 07:18.290
The theme for our look
is Santa's Workshop,

07:18.300 --> 07:20.000
and we'll be all dressed as elves,

07:20.040 --> 07:22.219
and you will be Mrs. Claus.

07:22.220 --> 07:24.320
My festive theatrical child.

07:24.430 --> 07:26.620
And Ricky's gonna help
me, if that's okay.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.420
He doesn't need my permission.
I'm not his mother.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.300
Well, since he has a trophy,

07:32.320 --> 07:34.750
I'd like for you to
consider letting him join

07:34.760 --> 07:36.100
the House of Evangelista.

07:36.180 --> 07:37.200
Mm.

07:38.370 --> 07:39.800
Tell me, where'd you get the coat?

07:40.980 --> 07:43.620
- It was my grandmother's.
- Don't bullshit me.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.180
That offends me.

07:49.390 --> 07:52.519
I mopped it, from a
coat check in midtown.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.980
I just wanted to get a trophy,

07:54.020 --> 07:56.000
so I-I borrowed it. But
I'm gonna take it back.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.680
That's not what Evangelista's about.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.500
Let's get something straight.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.330
I'm not running a halfway home.

08:05.430 --> 08:07.720
We're a family, and I'm
building a legacy.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.070
I'll admit, you got something special,

08:10.170 --> 08:11.599
but you're cocky.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.420
Judges don't want arrogance,
they want confidence.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.280
If you want to win grand prize,

08:15.380 --> 08:17.780
we're gonna need to work on your struts.

08:17.820 --> 08:20.250
See, I told you she'd let you in.

08:20.260 --> 08:22.760
No, this is a trial run.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.720
You better bring it at the Snow Ball.

08:25.740 --> 08:26.900
Okay.

08:27.180 --> 08:29.400
I'm being a good person
by letting you in.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.950
Which means I do not want you

08:31.960 --> 08:33.919
distracting Damon from his studies.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.360
If you plan on living under my roof,

08:36.470 --> 08:38.260
I expect you to keep him on track.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.520
- I promise, Blanca.
- Good.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.679
And you can call me Mother.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.340
Cheers.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.280
Cheers.

08:48.380 --> 08:49.380
Cheers, Mother.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.180
Ooh, I like the ring of that.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.290
Costas.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.940
Is this your lunch?

10:14.620 --> 10:16.430
It must be Maryanne on duty.

10:16.530 --> 10:18.200
She never brings it in.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.540
It's Christmas.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.540
I'm the prince.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.660
Dance with me, Clara.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.520
Tony, you need to get back into bed.

11:00.540 --> 11:01.880
Get away!

11:02.940 --> 11:05.020
- You're ruining it.
- Nurse!

11:05.040 --> 11:06.350
Nurse!

11:06.450 --> 11:07.720
Nurse!

11:16.060 --> 11:18.530
She didn't even give you a fork
to eat this fucking meal with.

11:18.630 --> 11:20.179
- I'm not even hungry.
- Bullshit.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.900
You have to eat something.

11:21.920 --> 11:22.960
Get your strength back.

11:23.740 --> 11:25.400
Don't look at me like that.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.240
You have pneumonia.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.040
I've seen people

11:29.860 --> 11:32.240
walk out of this hospital

11:32.270 --> 11:34.720
who were much worse than that.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.560
We got Christmas plans, baby.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.860
Go see the windows on Fifth,

11:41.700 --> 11:44.460
take a carriage ride
through Central Park,

11:45.320 --> 11:47.139
go see The Nutcracker.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.360
When did you get here?

11:53.080 --> 11:55.160
What was I doing out of bed?

11:57.330 --> 11:59.180
You were dancing.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.120
You've always been my most brilliant,

12:03.920 --> 12:05.620
dedicated student.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.080
You were dancing, my darling.

12:22.540 --> 12:25.290
I can't believe I'm gonna spend
my last Christmas in here.

12:31.530 --> 12:33.370
This is incredible.

12:33.470 --> 12:36.139
I ain't never met anyone
who was a real genius,

12:36.140 --> 12:38.560
but you have the gift.

12:39.310 --> 12:41.379
You need to make a New
Year's resolution, Pray Tell.

12:41.380 --> 12:42.410
Elevate your game.

12:42.510 --> 12:44.960
Get your designs on a real runway.

12:45.020 --> 12:47.960
A happy man knows his place.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.180
Who ever got anywhere
by knowing their place?

12:50.200 --> 12:52.430
A man who knows his place
might as well be a dead man.

12:52.450 --> 12:54.336
A resolution ain't nothing
without a friend to kick

12:54.360 --> 12:55.856
your ass to make sure you stick to it.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.819
No point in me fighting with you.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.840
I know.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.490
So shut up and finish pinning.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.979
I'm gonna melt the Snow Ball
with this piece of finery.

13:03.980 --> 13:06.080
Send Elektra limping into the new year.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.740
What you doing for Christmas Day?

13:09.820 --> 13:12.440
Nothing. I'll probably go to the movies.

13:12.540 --> 13:14.500
They have discount matinees.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.340
Theater's all quiet and empty.

13:17.450 --> 13:18.776
Well, what about that cute
guy you've been seeing

13:18.800 --> 13:20.100
that works for the city?

13:20.920 --> 13:24.480
He... is at Roosevelt Hospital.

13:24.590 --> 13:26.540
- What?
- Yeah.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.840
You two was out dancing at
Escuelita's just last month.

13:30.860 --> 13:32.000
Yes.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.460
How bad?

13:38.330 --> 13:40.370
Pneumonia... We don't need to talk about

13:40.470 --> 13:42.240
- this right now.
- What?

13:57.520 --> 14:00.099
You think this is the first
time since I've been diagnosed

14:00.100 --> 14:02.940
that I had to talk about
somebody dying of this plague?

14:04.530 --> 14:06.620
Don't you dare treat me as delicate.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.960
The worst part is...

14:10.620 --> 14:12.760
that I'm used to it by now.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.680
You know how many boyfriends
I've seen go in there

14:18.140 --> 14:20.100
over the last four years?

14:21.340 --> 14:23.920
How are we supposed to get
invested in someone...

14:25.450 --> 14:28.380
if they can be gone a week later?

14:29.520 --> 14:32.390
As if this life wasn't hard enough.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.130
Oh, my God...

14:46.470 --> 14:48.140
Do your kids know you're positive?

14:48.220 --> 14:49.980
Now, what good would that do?

14:51.020 --> 14:55.080
I'm trying to build something
that lasts beyond me.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.419
And none of them are gonna commit

14:58.420 --> 15:00.420
to what I need them to do

15:00.840 --> 15:02.960
if they think I might
leave them tomorrow.

15:03.020 --> 15:04.480
Not that I'm going anywhere.

15:05.300 --> 15:08.439
And no way you are sitting
all alone in a movie theater

15:08.440 --> 15:11.040
getting fat off popcorn on Christmas.

15:11.100 --> 15:13.780
You're coming to supper, at my house.

15:14.740 --> 15:16.300
Would you close your eyes for me?

15:18.740 --> 15:20.130
Okay...

15:36.320 --> 15:37.900
Open.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.080
We got, uh...

15:48.160 --> 15:50.880
... all brand-new appliances.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.720
Microwave, toaster.

15:52.820 --> 15:56.120
We got, uh, all new Formica countertops.

15:57.560 --> 15:58.800
Dusty.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.480
I got the, um...

16:02.960 --> 16:04.879
... the TV and VCR, they're on order.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.240
T-That should be, uh,
arriving next week.

16:08.150 --> 16:09.420
Over there.

16:13.260 --> 16:17.800
This is so beautiful.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.920
Wow.

16:26.230 --> 16:28.070
Oh, my God.

16:43.020 --> 16:44.960
I don't know what to say.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.940
I feel so safe here.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.430
Like nothing could ever hurt me.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.000
Can you make me a promise?

17:03.580 --> 17:05.560
On Christmas Day,

17:07.359 --> 17:09.280
I know you have your kids and stuff...

17:14.300 --> 17:16.349
... but if you could just come at night,

17:16.780 --> 17:19.290
even just for an hour.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.680
For a glass of eggnog,

17:22.740 --> 17:24.660
or whatever.

17:26.540 --> 17:29.360
It would really make this
place feel like a home to me.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.560
Of course I will.

17:42.410 --> 17:44.180
Mm.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.910
Wide legs!

19:00.010 --> 19:01.780
Yes. Yes.

19:06.190 --> 19:07.380
Very good.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.050
Sorry to interrupt.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.090
Ms. St. Rogers, there's a call for you.

19:13.130 --> 19:15.860
Uh, continue, everyone.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.280
This is Helena.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.620
Wait, when did he, uh...

19:28.100 --> 19:30.070
This morning?

19:30.180 --> 19:33.640
Uh, no, no, I don't have
his parent's information.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.060
I'm not family.

19:37.220 --> 19:38.780
Just his teacher.

19:39.660 --> 19:42.066
Five, six, seven, eight.

19:42.090 --> 19:44.119
One, two, three, four,

19:44.120 --> 19:46.120
five, six, seven, eight.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.859
Feeling, more feeling, more feeling.

19:48.860 --> 19:50.060
More feel...

19:50.080 --> 19:52.040
Papi, that's not what I choreographed.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.260
You look like a gremlin.

19:53.270 --> 19:55.580
- I ain't a dancer.
- It's like this:

19:55.620 --> 19:57.659
if you are going to win at Snow Ball...

19:57.660 --> 19:59.800
and we are all walking as a house...

19:59.980 --> 20:01.440
we have to do it like this,

20:01.560 --> 20:03.070
because that's the way to win, okay?

20:03.180 --> 20:04.180
So just watch me.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.579
Five, six, five,

20:06.580 --> 20:08.160
six, seven, eight.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.470
One, two, three, four, down.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.480
Got it?

20:11.500 --> 20:12.679
- Yeah.
- Okay?

20:12.680 --> 20:15.820
Five, six, seven, eight.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.190
Yes. That's great.

20:17.290 --> 20:18.540
- Yes, it's great.
- Yeah?

20:18.600 --> 20:20.460
- Y-Yes, yes, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.760
Now you just got to learn
the other 50 moves.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.916
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay, but that was good, that was good.

20:24.940 --> 20:26.330
We gonna be here all day.

20:26.430 --> 20:27.580
You got it?

20:28.470 --> 20:29.780
Oh, my God, I'm late.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.940
Papi, ignore them, you're doing great.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.080
Keep practicing, okay?

20:33.210 --> 20:34.480
Yo, Papi.

20:34.720 --> 20:35.939
What's up?

20:35.940 --> 20:37.310
Shut up.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.780
Five, six, seven, eight.

20:42.820 --> 20:44.619
Two, two, three, four,

20:44.620 --> 20:46.389
five, six, seven, eight.

20:46.390 --> 20:48.840
Three, two, three, four, five, six,

20:48.920 --> 20:51.740
seven, eight, four, two...
get that leg higher.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.160
Higher!

20:53.260 --> 20:54.330
Stop.

20:54.430 --> 20:55.720
Damon.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.960
I-I'm sorry, I'm not...

20:57.000 --> 20:58.330
Warmed up?

20:58.430 --> 21:02.000
Warm-up was half an hour
ago when class started.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.180
I'm-I'm sorry, I was coming

21:03.240 --> 21:04.516
from all the way uptown, and I just...

21:04.540 --> 21:05.680
Marcus.

21:05.970 --> 21:07.480
Where'd you come from for class?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.900
- Crown Heights.
- Uh-huh. He was on time.

21:10.110 --> 21:12.560
Why you got to call me out in
front of everybody like that?

21:12.700 --> 21:14.439
I have two tools I use

21:14.440 --> 21:16.880
to get students to
reach their potential.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.800
Encouragement and shame.

21:19.940 --> 21:22.560
Taking you to the ballet,
that was encouragement.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.900
But that didn't work, so now
I'm moving on to shame.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.220
I took a chance on you.

21:28.700 --> 21:31.299
And I don't care if you think
you're the next Alvin Ailey,

21:31.300 --> 21:34.440
you will never know if you
don't have any respect for me

21:34.540 --> 21:36.460
or this place or yourself.

21:36.480 --> 21:37.700
I love this place.

21:37.740 --> 21:39.200
I mean, it's everything to me.

21:39.270 --> 21:41.300
But weren't you the one
that told me to go out

21:41.320 --> 21:44.540
into the world, a-and explore my
artistry and find my own voice?

21:44.560 --> 21:46.880
Greatness comes from suffering.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.919
From failing over and over

21:49.920 --> 21:52.480
until you bleed and cry.

21:52.740 --> 21:54.459
And then, finally, something inside

21:54.460 --> 21:55.880
just cracks open.

21:56.020 --> 21:57.120
I've got time.

21:57.220 --> 21:58.660
Time is not your friend.

21:59.030 --> 22:01.480
It's coming for you, for all of us.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.700
It shows no mercy and it always wins,

22:04.740 --> 22:07.580
and then you're gone, forgotten.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.070
I'm really sorry, I-I... I was
getting ready for a ball,

22:14.170 --> 22:15.540
- and I...
- A ball?

22:16.180 --> 22:18.720
Is that the size of your dreams now?

22:20.310 --> 22:21.700
Get out of my class.

22:21.740 --> 22:22.820
What?

22:23.050 --> 22:24.140
Now.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.030
Let's go from the top.

22:34.130 --> 22:37.130
And... five, six, seven, eight.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.230
I'm not kidding, it's
like a superpower I have.

22:39.330 --> 22:41.100
I can tell just by looking at you

22:41.140 --> 22:42.640
how you groom your pubic hair.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.340
Hmm?

22:54.920 --> 22:57.050
Wasn't that an executive
council meeting?

22:57.150 --> 22:58.640
Yeah. I, uh...

22:59.100 --> 23:01.480
I had this idea that
if movies or TV shows

23:01.500 --> 23:03.320
wanted to shoot in any
of our properties,

23:03.520 --> 23:05.340
that they should give the boss a cameo.

23:05.420 --> 23:07.089
And they thought it
was such a good idea,

23:07.090 --> 23:08.460
I should tell it directly to him.

23:08.680 --> 23:11.130
Instead of taking it to me first?

23:14.540 --> 23:16.600
That's my lane, buddy.

23:17.060 --> 23:19.340
Yeah, I-I didn't mean any disrespect.

23:21.170 --> 23:24.180
Nobody stopped you from
coming into that meeting.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.600
Say, what are you up
to on Christmas, huh?

23:44.620 --> 23:46.560
Elektra Abundance?

23:46.660 --> 23:47.940
Come right with me.

23:56.140 --> 23:58.300
_

24:19.100 --> 24:21.870
Good morning, Elektra.
I'm Dr. Gottfried.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.230
Please have a seat.

24:23.340 --> 24:25.960
I apologize for being
vague on the phone.

24:25.980 --> 24:27.440
We're a new program at the hospital,

24:27.460 --> 24:30.000
and we have to operate
under the radar for now.

24:30.160 --> 24:33.380
I'm a bit nervous. I haven't
been to the doctor since '79.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.560
Well, that is a long time.

24:34.660 --> 24:36.480
We should definitely do some blood work.

24:36.540 --> 24:38.120
I don't have the virus.

24:38.220 --> 24:39.459
Well, that's good to hear,

24:39.460 --> 24:41.200
but AIDS care isn't my specialty.

24:41.220 --> 24:42.680
I'm a urologist.

24:43.060 --> 24:45.400
Our new program

24:45.840 --> 24:49.319
specializes in holistic
care, something lacking

24:49.320 --> 24:51.000
for transsexual patients.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.900
It's the kind of practice my mentor,

24:52.940 --> 24:56.540
Dr. Peter Harris, formalized
in the '60s and '70s.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.000
God rest his soul.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.970
That man saved my life.

25:00.070 --> 25:02.310
Anything he told me to do, I did it.

25:02.410 --> 25:04.360
Psychological evaluations,

25:04.440 --> 25:07.310
hormone shots, electrolysis, everything.

25:07.720 --> 25:11.220
Dr. Harris helped me find Elektra.

25:11.260 --> 25:14.540
Well, we fought hard to keep the
clinic open after his death,

25:14.740 --> 25:17.220
but the hospital was overwhelmed
with AIDS patients,

25:17.320 --> 25:19.050
and it didn't help
that the board thought

25:19.060 --> 25:21.720
what we did was unnatural
and unnecessary.

25:21.740 --> 25:24.840
They wanted us to just go
away, and we did for a bit,

25:24.860 --> 25:26.380
but we are back,

25:26.500 --> 25:29.000
and I am building the foremost practice

25:29.100 --> 25:30.680
and research center

25:30.760 --> 25:33.760
for transsexual medicine
in the United States.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.110
- Which is why I called you.
- Me?

25:36.210 --> 25:38.280
You are at the top of Dr.
Harris's wait list

25:38.380 --> 25:40.240
for sexual reassignment surgery.

25:40.350 --> 25:42.110
It's even noted in his records that

25:42.120 --> 25:44.050
he tried to call you numerous times.

25:44.150 --> 25:45.720
Why didn't you follow up with him?

25:45.780 --> 25:46.980
The list was long.

25:47.060 --> 25:49.460
I didn't have the luxury
to sit around waiting.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.000
I didn't resign.

25:51.060 --> 25:53.610
I just hustled my ass off
dancing in glass boxes

25:53.620 --> 25:55.540
to fulfill my most immediate needs.

25:55.660 --> 25:57.130
Show World?

25:57.230 --> 25:58.820
I have other patients employed there.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.130
"Employed" makes it sound
like a profession.

26:01.230 --> 26:02.560
It's a freak show.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.310
Well, I have a space reserved for you.

26:04.460 --> 26:06.060
You are an ideal candidate.

26:06.140 --> 26:09.390
And if your blood work and your
physical examination clear,

26:09.410 --> 26:11.320
we could operate in the new year.

26:11.460 --> 26:13.340
How much does it all cost?

26:13.580 --> 26:16.600
I will have my nurse go
over the details with you.

26:34.100 --> 26:35.480
What is that?

26:36.140 --> 26:37.560
A wreath.

26:37.970 --> 26:40.100
I thought we'd bring a little
holiday spirit in here.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.559
I tried to tell her a wreath

26:42.560 --> 26:44.080
ain't gonna fix my mood.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.299
Christmas ain't nothing
but a sad-ass reminder

26:46.300 --> 26:47.380
of what we don't have.

26:47.460 --> 26:49.580
Well, maybe we should
do it up this year.

26:49.660 --> 26:51.519
Get a tree, some presents,

26:51.520 --> 26:53.289
make it a Christmas to remember.

26:53.290 --> 26:55.340
Maybe your daddy could
help us out this year?

26:55.440 --> 26:56.500
How dare you?

26:56.560 --> 26:58.459
I'm not some white girl
toting an unlimited

26:58.460 --> 27:00.240
American Express card in my Gucci bag.

27:00.290 --> 27:02.500
You girls never think
about how hard I work.

27:02.540 --> 27:04.160
You never see my burden.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.820
All you see are the jewels and the furs

27:05.840 --> 27:07.500
and you think I live some high life.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.940
But you don't know that he counts

27:08.960 --> 27:10.299
everything he gives to me,

27:10.300 --> 27:11.920
every single cent,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.020
every single goddamn gift.

27:14.140 --> 27:17.110
And anything I manage to steal
away goes to Abundance:

27:17.140 --> 27:19.260
the rent, the lights, the food.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.160
We're grateful for all
you do for us, Mother.

27:28.820 --> 27:31.700
Girls, I'm sorry.

27:31.990 --> 27:33.420
Sometimes I get in a bad mood,

27:33.430 --> 27:35.060
particularly around the holidays.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.090
But why should I take that out on you?

27:37.200 --> 27:38.559
You're stupid,

27:38.560 --> 27:40.299
but not incapable.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.310
Let's get going.

27:41.320 --> 27:44.070
Mother has a plan to deck
these fucking halls.

27:44.170 --> 27:46.040
Ho, ho, ho.

27:46.140 --> 27:49.040
Merry Christmas to you.

27:49.140 --> 27:52.180
Very generous. Thank you.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.480
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

28:05.620 --> 28:06.960
Hey, Santa.

28:07.060 --> 28:10.030
Well, hello, dear. Merry
Christmas to you.

28:13.100 --> 28:15.040
Thank you.

28:15.300 --> 28:18.100
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

28:22.070 --> 28:23.319
My purse.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.110
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.110
I'm so sorry.

28:31.350 --> 28:33.050
Now.

28:37.190 --> 28:38.420
Get off of him.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.636
She's taking the money!

28:41.660 --> 28:43.740
Hey, stop them!

28:56.720 --> 28:58.440
Oh, my...

28:58.720 --> 29:01.580
I ain't never seen this much
money all in one place.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.940
That's why we hit the
bucket up on Madison.

29:04.060 --> 29:06.679
Every dollar one of those
rich, Upper East Side bitches

29:06.680 --> 29:08.940
put in that bucket is a
gift back to themselves.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.700
Wipes away all the guilt they feel

29:10.720 --> 29:12.470
about spending all that
money on silliness

29:12.500 --> 29:13.770
to put under their tree.

29:13.870 --> 29:15.816
Wait, but isn't this money
supposed to go to, like,

29:15.840 --> 29:17.470
- starving kids or something?
- Uh-uh.

29:17.570 --> 29:19.640
If we ain't charity, then who is?

29:19.740 --> 29:20.979
When is the last time

29:20.980 --> 29:22.919
you had a present under
the Christmas tree?

29:22.920 --> 29:23.920
Exactly.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.810
My daddy used to buy me
trucks for Christmas

29:26.920 --> 29:29.180
and I would just steal
my sister's Barbie dolls

29:29.220 --> 29:30.930
and have Barbie riding
around in them trucks

29:30.950 --> 29:32.379
like a queen and some shit.

29:32.380 --> 29:33.399
Fuck Barbie.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.659
They had Olympic Barbie,

29:34.660 --> 29:36.599
Malibu Barbie, Doctor Barbie.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.590
All kinds of Barbies, but they
only had one black Barbie,

29:39.640 --> 29:42.500
Christie, and she was still
built like a white girl.

29:42.840 --> 29:46.579
There is $2,300 here.

29:46.580 --> 29:48.180
Christmas miracle.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.400
Thank you, Jesus.

29:49.460 --> 29:50.919
We can get three trees now.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.040
Trees? Girl, we can get wigs,

29:53.060 --> 29:55.540
- the human kind.
- Girl, we can go to the spa.

29:55.580 --> 29:56.590
Oh, my God, and get a massage.

29:56.600 --> 29:57.880
- A back massage.
- Ooh.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.480
Them red boots we saw the other day,

29:59.580 --> 30:01.296
- them snakeskin boots.
- Oh, those are so cute, girl.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.676
Oh. Those would look so good on me.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.980
Ooh, we could walk the
runway in those, girl.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.936
- We would win the house down.
- They would look cute on me.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.740
- Boots, girl.
- Mm. Mm-mm-mm-mm.

30:08.820 --> 30:11.040
And we can go to Bloomingdale's
and not that cheap shit.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.560
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

30:13.660 --> 30:17.080
All of your Christmas
dreams will come true.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.099
That's $2,300,

30:34.100 --> 30:36.520
more than enough for a
deposit for my surgery.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.160
You can sign me up.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.240
It's a different thing to be a mother

30:55.300 --> 30:56.700
who chooses her children.

30:57.260 --> 30:58.909
We got to deal with our mistakes

30:58.910 --> 31:00.360
and also the mistakes of the mothers

31:00.380 --> 31:01.840
who brought them into this world.

31:01.880 --> 31:04.340
We don't get the benefits
of a clean slate.

31:04.380 --> 31:06.380
And I've seen a lot of
mothers in my world

31:06.420 --> 31:07.899
use that as some sort of excuse

31:07.900 --> 31:09.920
for bad behavior, but not me.

31:09.960 --> 31:13.340
Once you're in my house,
you're my responsibility.

31:13.380 --> 31:15.080
And Damon doesn't understand yet

31:15.140 --> 31:17.750
that we don't got but so
much time in this world

31:17.760 --> 31:19.829
and that the people out
there are gonna start

31:19.830 --> 31:21.700
stealing pieces of his from him.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.279
What's stealing from him

31:23.280 --> 31:25.280
is his interest in those balls.

31:25.640 --> 31:28.039
What we do here is work,

31:28.040 --> 31:29.869
not the instant gratification

31:29.870 --> 31:32.159
that comes from dressing up

31:32.160 --> 31:33.660
and walking for a trophy.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.160
Excuse me?

31:35.810 --> 31:37.910
Miss Uptown Fancy with
your African jewels

31:38.010 --> 31:39.950
and your sterling silver.

31:40.050 --> 31:41.359
We can talk about Damon,

31:41.360 --> 31:42.789
but what we're not gonna do

31:42.790 --> 31:45.380
is sit here and look down
our noses at my world.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.140
You have any idea the work

31:47.160 --> 31:49.790
and struggle that goes
into walking a category?

31:49.960 --> 31:51.500
The point is I do understand,

31:51.560 --> 31:54.260
which is why I'm saying Damon
doesn't have time for both.

31:54.530 --> 31:56.860
And unless a mother
forces a child to make

31:56.880 --> 31:59.000
the right choice, he's
gonna choose the work

31:59.040 --> 32:00.630
that makes him feel good right now.

32:00.740 --> 32:03.200
So you're questioning my
parenting skills now.

32:04.880 --> 32:08.140
There's a difference between
inspiration and distraction.

32:08.610 --> 32:10.850
Damon has more God-given
talent than most,

32:10.950 --> 32:13.680
but not enough to succeed
without real commitment.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.320
At the end of the semester,
I'm going to make cuts.

32:18.900 --> 32:21.500
At this point, Damon doesn't make it.

32:23.830 --> 32:25.240
I'm home.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.460
Uh-uh. These are for
decorating later. Sit down.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.010
I went and talked to your
teacher this morning.

32:31.030 --> 32:32.870
- She called.
- I'm sorry.

32:32.970 --> 32:34.716
I should've told you, but
I thought I could get it

32:34.740 --> 32:36.236
all figured out before
you even had to know.

32:36.260 --> 32:38.659
Well, here's a subway
pass and a bus pass

32:38.660 --> 32:40.020
so you can never use the excuse

32:40.040 --> 32:41.479
that you had no money for tokens

32:41.480 --> 32:43.720
and you was late because
you had to walk to class.

32:43.750 --> 32:46.300
You will not blow this opportunity

32:46.340 --> 32:47.730
while you are living in my house.

32:47.750 --> 32:49.100
I'm sorry, Mother. I know.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.279
I already told Ricky

32:50.280 --> 32:52.060
that I'm not gonna be around as much.

32:52.160 --> 32:54.200
I promise. I'll be good from now on.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.600
Oh, and no balls for a month
until you can prove to me

32:56.630 --> 32:57.830
that you can keep your word.

32:57.930 --> 32:59.319
Yeah, but not the Snow Ball, right?

32:59.320 --> 33:01.020
No balls means no balls.

33:01.140 --> 33:02.220
What?

33:02.280 --> 33:04.870
I told you how much
Christmas means to me.

33:04.970 --> 33:06.499
It's my one time of the year

33:06.500 --> 33:08.200
and you're taking that away from me?

33:08.400 --> 33:10.480
The one thing that I care about.

33:10.500 --> 33:12.860
Well, you know what, I'm going
no matter what you say.

33:12.940 --> 33:15.180
You can't stop me from
walking if I want to.

33:15.220 --> 33:17.180
No, but I can throw all
your shit out the window

33:17.220 --> 33:18.240
and on the street if you do.

33:18.260 --> 33:19.540
You want to fucking try me?!

33:19.580 --> 33:20.600
I hate you for doing this to me!

33:20.620 --> 33:22.420
Well, go and hate me in your room.

33:37.700 --> 33:38.900
Can I help you?

33:39.600 --> 33:41.296
Yeah. I'm looking for
something for my wife.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.800
My mommy!

33:42.820 --> 33:44.200
What is her skin tone?

33:44.720 --> 33:46.619
Different metals and gemstones look best

33:46.620 --> 33:47.940
with specific skin tones.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.320
Never heard that before.

33:49.380 --> 33:52.099
She's, uh, got brownish-reddish hair,

33:52.100 --> 33:54.100
pale skin, brown eyes.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.640
She has a cool skin tone.

33:55.730 --> 33:57.839
You're gonna want white gold
or silver, nothing yellow

33:57.840 --> 34:00.040
and a bright stone.

34:00.180 --> 34:03.480
I have this really lovely
white gold bracelet

34:03.600 --> 34:05.340
with twin rubies.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.040
What do you think?

34:11.100 --> 34:12.179
Think Mommy'd like that?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.679
- Wrap it up for me.
- Mm-hmm.

34:31.280 --> 34:32.918
Hey, honey, why don't you go

34:32.920 --> 34:34.420
play in that little
playground out there?

34:34.440 --> 34:36.469
I'll be out there in one minute, okay?

34:36.480 --> 34:38.540
Okay.

34:40.510 --> 34:42.280
Thanks.

34:43.139 --> 34:44.880
Uh...

34:45.239 --> 34:47.639
What about somebody with
a darker skin tone,

34:47.679 --> 34:49.120
like, Puerto Rican?

34:49.940 --> 34:51.879
White gold is gonna make her look ruddy.

34:51.880 --> 34:55.340
You want yellow gold
with an earthy stone.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.490
Like this yellow gold necklace,

34:59.590 --> 35:01.690
with the orange sapphire pendant.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.200
Between you and me?

35:09.260 --> 35:11.590
I always say to spend more
on the gift for the goomah.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.820
If your wife isn't happy,
she isn't gonna be calling

35:13.840 --> 35:15.340
your house at 2:00 in the morning.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.560
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.710
Sure. I'll wrap it in a separate box.

36:00.780 --> 36:02.440
Merry Christmas.

36:04.460 --> 36:06.620
I like to come into Jersey
to do my Christmas shopping.

36:06.690 --> 36:09.180
The sales tax is two percent
lower here than in the city.

36:09.220 --> 36:11.410
I was in the neighborhood, I
figured I would just stop by

36:11.430 --> 36:13.080
and give you guys my gifts.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.500
It's not wise to drink alone.

36:25.340 --> 36:27.280
This place is so suburban.

36:27.550 --> 36:29.140
I mean that as a compliment.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.579
Any man who tells you he
wouldn't give it all up and

36:31.580 --> 36:34.380
end up in his own version of
this place is lying to you.

36:34.590 --> 36:36.690
I prefer a little more
flash in the decor.

36:36.790 --> 36:38.740
At least four kids, but the woman...

36:40.060 --> 36:41.540
woman would be just like you.

36:48.860 --> 36:51.060
All you playboys long for family life,

36:51.080 --> 36:53.060
but you couldn't stand
it once you got it.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.800
When I was 25, maybe.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.700
But now...

37:03.260 --> 37:04.500
now, I get lonely.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.540
Especially this time of year.

37:14.590 --> 37:16.180
When does Stan get home?

37:17.540 --> 37:21.880
Um, he's out Christmas
shopping with our daughter.

37:22.340 --> 37:25.019
I'm used to not seeing him
around much these days.

37:25.020 --> 37:26.920
You have him working such crazy hours.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.100
He's more married to
you than he is to me.

37:29.760 --> 37:33.080
I don't think I've ever called
Stan into the city after hours.

37:34.020 --> 37:36.920
Well, if you're not calling
him in, then who is?

37:40.240 --> 37:41.799
Beats me.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.620
I'm not the only one he reports to.

37:45.980 --> 37:47.480
You should ask him.

37:55.860 --> 37:58.040
I get why he's working so hard, though.

37:59.980 --> 38:02.060
I mean, I was the same way, at first.

38:04.100 --> 38:06.510
Nothing feels better than success.

38:06.610 --> 38:07.940
You get addicted.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.450
Problem is that you
can't control yourself.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.180
You start caring more
about the next fix.

38:16.690 --> 38:19.060
New suit, new car, new girl.

38:19.560 --> 38:23.540
Instead of what's really
important: family.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.670
But you can understand that, right?

38:31.140 --> 38:33.500
People need that ego hit sometimes.

38:35.540 --> 38:37.160
Even in the suburbs?

38:40.480 --> 38:41.960
I mean, when was the last time

38:41.970 --> 38:44.100
you had an experience
that was brand-new?

38:45.690 --> 38:47.120
Hmm?

38:48.760 --> 38:50.460
One that was just for you?

39:04.080 --> 39:05.460
Weird.

39:06.310 --> 39:08.319
You've kissed all those supermodels

39:08.320 --> 39:09.420
and beauty queens, and

39:09.440 --> 39:11.720
you're still not very good at it.

39:12.820 --> 39:14.480
I'll do better next time.

39:14.740 --> 39:16.400
There won't be a next time.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.760
Hey, honey?

39:18.620 --> 39:20.440
Whose Mercedes is out front?

39:26.530 --> 39:27.820
Stanley!

39:27.920 --> 39:29.530
Welcome home.

39:29.630 --> 39:31.220
Mommy!

39:31.500 --> 39:32.940
What are you doing here?

39:33.370 --> 39:34.670
Playing Santa.

39:34.770 --> 39:37.220
Dropping off presents
for you and the kids.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.180
All the way out to Jersey?

39:46.580 --> 39:47.840
Come sit on my lap.

39:49.550 --> 39:51.440
Well, thanks for coming by, man. I'll...

39:51.460 --> 39:52.900
I'll show you out.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.620
Patty.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.419
Thank you for the wine, and the chat.

39:57.420 --> 39:59.380
Yep. Thanks, Matt. Merry Christmas.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.020
Heck of a woman you got there, Stan.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.630
Don't fuck it up.

40:10.800 --> 40:13.470
Next time you want to come to my house,

40:14.180 --> 40:16.380
you call me first.

40:17.740 --> 40:19.380
Merry Christmas, bud.

40:24.620 --> 40:25.880
Patty.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.280
What was all that about?

40:27.320 --> 40:30.000
He told you. He was just
dropping off some presents.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.000
Are y'all ready?

40:41.060 --> 40:43.360
Because the category is:

40:43.860 --> 40:47.380
Stone Cold Face.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.380
Yes. And here she goes.

40:51.510 --> 40:52.510
Slender.

40:53.100 --> 40:54.560
Tender.

40:54.580 --> 40:55.840
For your gender.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.740
Looking like a red Virginia Slim.

40:57.820 --> 40:59.360
Judges, your scores.

40:59.590 --> 41:02.650
Nine, nine, nine, nine.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.660
Thank you very much.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.660
Next.

41:09.900 --> 41:13.600
This is a face category,
not a fashion category.

41:13.740 --> 41:15.739
If God hath given you

41:15.740 --> 41:17.920
the eyebrows of Brooke Shields,

41:17.980 --> 41:20.500
show the motherfuckers off!

41:22.300 --> 41:24.000
Ah!

41:24.100 --> 41:27.880
And the princess has arrived!

41:28.840 --> 41:31.450
Yes.

41:31.550 --> 41:33.800
Breathtaking.

41:33.880 --> 41:37.860
This chilling angel has
clearly been resuscitated.

41:39.790 --> 41:41.140
Uh-huh.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.120
Judges, your scores?

41:43.260 --> 41:45.020
Ten, ten, ten, ten.

41:45.080 --> 41:48.660
Breathtaking scores for the
frostiest bitch in New York.

41:48.700 --> 41:52.020
Grand prize, Miss Angel, Evangelista.

41:55.800 --> 41:58.360
You know it's yours,
you know it's yours.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.570
How did we do?

42:24.160 --> 42:25.700
First runner up.

42:25.810 --> 42:27.440
Not bad.

42:27.540 --> 42:29.500
Yeah, we would've won if you were there.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.460
It tore up my guts to keep it from you.

42:32.650 --> 42:34.720
No, you were right.

42:38.200 --> 42:39.900
You're a good mother.

42:49.630 --> 42:51.459
I was sitting here in the dark trying

42:51.460 --> 42:55.380
to remember when I found
out Santa Claus wasn't real.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.360
No one ever told me straight out.

43:00.620 --> 43:04.640
It didn't come like a bullet,
it came like poison.

43:05.980 --> 43:07.920
You know, the kind that act real slow.

43:09.680 --> 43:12.460
So you don't even know it's
there until you're dead.

43:12.560 --> 43:15.819
My sister made sure to tell me
the second someone told her.

43:15.820 --> 43:18.660
Came right into my
room and announced it.

43:18.760 --> 43:20.720
"Santa ain't real."

43:22.400 --> 43:25.340
I couldn't have been more
than four years old.

43:25.420 --> 43:27.120
Did you believe her?

43:28.400 --> 43:29.820
I mean, a hundred percent?

43:29.840 --> 43:31.320
Nah.

43:31.420 --> 43:32.600
I guess I didn't.

43:35.300 --> 43:37.240
I want to go back there.

43:38.060 --> 43:40.980
I mean, not back home
or to my parents, but...

43:44.780 --> 43:47.720
I want to go back to when
I could be innocent.

43:49.500 --> 43:52.120
Or at least remember when I lost it.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.699
You don't know that that
feeling's not forever

43:55.700 --> 43:58.300
until it's too late.

44:23.770 --> 44:25.810
Morning, sleepyhead.

44:27.210 --> 44:28.340
Mm-hmm?

44:28.440 --> 44:29.900
Merry Christmas.

44:30.340 --> 44:31.900
Merry Christmas.

44:33.150 --> 44:34.740
Are you hungry? I made you breakfast.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.220
Oh.

44:37.820 --> 44:39.940
Christmas morning was
always special in my house.

44:40.120 --> 44:41.680
Traditions are important to me.

44:41.740 --> 44:44.120
We'll start our own, then.

44:52.280 --> 44:53.730
Bam.

44:59.940 --> 45:01.040
What is it?

45:01.060 --> 45:02.560
You got to open it.

45:12.120 --> 45:14.800
This is the one that I
was eyeing at The Wiz.

45:16.500 --> 45:19.900
- Wait, did you mop this?
- No, I saved my coins.

45:20.620 --> 45:22.980
You deserve it, and more.

45:24.830 --> 45:27.760
♪ Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. ♪

45:35.140 --> 45:36.140
Mm.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.320
Is this my Christmas present?

45:38.810 --> 45:40.080
The first part.

45:40.180 --> 45:41.520
Yeah.

45:54.520 --> 45:55.780
I'm ready.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.400
Wait, are you sure?

46:06.240 --> 46:07.660
Ricky...

46:08.880 --> 46:10.800
I'm ready.

46:17.120 --> 46:18.420
How do we play?

46:18.440 --> 46:20.080
This is The Game of Life, baby.

46:20.100 --> 46:22.940
You just, you spin the wheel.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.880
Yeah, and you move it through the board.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.439
And then you, uh, you
get stuff on the way,

46:27.440 --> 46:29.200
and wh-whoever gets the most money

46:29.220 --> 46:31.350
and-and gets married
and has the most kids

46:31.360 --> 46:32.640
at the end of the game wins.

46:32.680 --> 46:34.216
And if there isn't a part of the game

46:34.240 --> 46:35.620
where you pee every time you sneeze

46:35.640 --> 46:38.360
and every so-called friend
disappoints you, it's a fraud.

46:38.400 --> 46:39.400
Bobbi.

46:39.440 --> 46:42.140
A child should know the truth.

46:49.260 --> 46:51.380
Mommy missed one of her presents.

46:51.920 --> 46:54.160
We got to give it to her.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.140
Stay here, okay?

47:02.560 --> 47:04.160
You missed one.

47:06.170 --> 47:08.100
I'll do it later.

47:09.360 --> 47:12.840
Come on, it's Christmas morning.

47:12.940 --> 47:14.620
There are more presents under that tree

47:14.630 --> 47:16.580
than the past three years combined.

47:16.880 --> 47:18.979
You've been acting like
this the whole time.

47:18.980 --> 47:20.780
What's up with you?

47:20.840 --> 47:23.080
Matt told me about never
making you work late.

47:24.420 --> 47:25.900
You've been lying to me.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.019
What the hell are you talking about?

47:30.020 --> 47:32.280
I'm talking about you
being a cheating asshole.

47:32.380 --> 47:34.659
I'm talking about you sticking
your dick in other women

47:34.660 --> 47:36.380
and then coming home to me.

47:36.440 --> 47:37.660
Who is she, huh?

47:37.780 --> 47:39.980
She one of those whore secretaries?

47:40.500 --> 47:42.800
Come on, kids, Mommy
and Daddy need to talk.

47:43.260 --> 47:45.140
Wouldn't be Christmas without a fight.

47:45.920 --> 47:47.799
You lost your mind? This
is your mother talking.

47:47.800 --> 47:49.090
She's constantly undermining you.

47:49.110 --> 47:50.300
Don't put this on me.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.460
I never said a bad word
about you in my life.

47:52.520 --> 47:54.860
- Not now, Ma, okay?
- Stop.

47:54.880 --> 47:56.220
Patty, stop.

47:56.260 --> 47:57.860
Listen to me.

47:58.050 --> 47:59.440
Matt isn't my only boss.

47:59.460 --> 48:01.500
I report to ten different people.

48:01.510 --> 48:03.400
He's jealous of what you and I have.

48:03.460 --> 48:05.620
Your daughter told me
about the two presents.

48:07.420 --> 48:08.960
You couldn't have waited till you

48:09.060 --> 48:12.820
weren't with our kid to buy
your girlfriend a present?

48:13.900 --> 48:16.770
I don't have a girlfriend.

48:20.100 --> 48:21.640
Want me to prove it?

48:24.220 --> 48:25.560
Merry Christmas.

48:26.920 --> 48:30.140
Yes, I bought a bracelet and a necklace.

48:31.020 --> 48:32.859
And I felt like shit

48:32.860 --> 48:34.500
about how much I've been working,

48:34.580 --> 48:36.356
and I haven't been home
to help with the kids,

48:36.380 --> 48:38.640
and so I bought you both.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.560
I'm sorry. I'm just...

48:44.600 --> 48:47.899
I'm not used to not having
you around all the time,

48:47.900 --> 48:49.099
and it's just me and the kids

48:49.100 --> 48:51.220
and all these thoughts in my brain.

48:51.240 --> 48:54.910
Yeah, I know, I know. It's okay.

48:55.010 --> 48:56.560
It's okay.

48:58.420 --> 49:01.140
We just got to make it through
the next couple years, okay?

49:01.540 --> 49:03.980
You know what my favorite
part of Christmas is?

49:04.090 --> 49:05.580
Your mom being here?

49:07.190 --> 49:08.580
No.

49:09.580 --> 49:11.199
No, and it's not the presents

49:11.200 --> 49:14.040
or the decorations or the music. It's...

49:14.500 --> 49:17.980
it's just us together
as a family all day.

49:19.600 --> 49:21.720
I love you.

49:21.970 --> 49:23.180
I know, baby.

49:23.300 --> 49:25.000
I love you, too.

49:30.110 --> 49:31.700
Merry Christmas.

50:08.050 --> 50:10.840
Oh, stop it. You're flattering me.

50:13.440 --> 50:14.760
Stop it.

50:17.920 --> 50:21.700
Angel, you naughty, naughty girl, you.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.160
So naughty.

51:17.120 --> 51:20.500
Boy, what are you doing?
There's a reason it's wrapped.

51:20.560 --> 51:22.360
Just tell me if Blanca's coming.

51:23.020 --> 51:24.800
Put the present down, please.

51:33.620 --> 51:35.280
You think this need more salt?

51:36.180 --> 51:37.800
Don't ask me.

51:37.880 --> 51:40.039
I ain't never cooked anything
besides a can of Chunky's.

51:40.040 --> 51:41.960
Oh, well, what's wrong with you?

51:42.120 --> 51:44.380
You still broken up about
your married white boy?

51:44.440 --> 51:45.920
Get over it.

51:46.140 --> 51:47.660
You here with your family now.

51:47.740 --> 51:49.179
The men will come and go,

51:49.180 --> 51:50.700
but we always here for you.

51:58.120 --> 51:59.140
The turkey!

51:59.180 --> 52:03.320
Oh, shit! Shit, shit. Oh, shit.

52:03.340 --> 52:06.310
- What-what do I do?
- Open the window.

52:06.320 --> 52:07.520
Hurry up, hurry.

52:22.160 --> 52:24.100
What are we gonna eat now?

52:27.480 --> 52:29.800
What y'all laughing at?

52:39.620 --> 52:41.740
I would order this platter.

52:41.750 --> 52:43.480
All right,

52:43.490 --> 52:45.619
before y'all fingers get greasy,

52:45.620 --> 52:47.260
let's open some of these gifts.

52:47.280 --> 52:48.980
Ain't got to tell me twice.

52:54.600 --> 52:55.940
This for you, Ricky.

53:07.210 --> 53:08.640
Damon.

53:08.660 --> 53:10.510
- Ah, shit!
- Thank you.

53:11.060 --> 53:14.180
I'm-a be stylin' and profilin'.

53:17.390 --> 53:19.000
Look inside.

53:23.590 --> 53:27.700
- Some socks for them feet.
- Thank you.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.060
Thank you.

53:34.220 --> 53:35.700
I got you.

53:39.580 --> 53:41.240
This one's for you.

53:50.590 --> 53:52.700
Before I met you, everything
was in black and white.

53:53.080 --> 53:56.640
And that kind of thinking
don't work in a gray world.

53:56.800 --> 53:59.219
You taught me to appreciate life and

53:59.220 --> 54:00.880
treasure every breath.

54:01.660 --> 54:04.460
You adjusted my focus
and now I see in color.

54:05.270 --> 54:07.420
I just hope you do
that for other people.

54:11.710 --> 54:12.920
Yeah.

54:20.800 --> 54:23.380
Angel, you... you didn't
open your present.

54:23.490 --> 54:26.280
Mm-mm. I told you I
didn't want anything.

54:26.380 --> 54:29.040
Oh, girl, open it.

54:36.530 --> 54:39.580
Mm-mm, not with that fork.

55:38.360 --> 55:40.640
Lord Jesus, you got us bawling like

55:40.660 --> 55:42.140
bitches before we've even eaten.

55:43.700 --> 55:45.180
What is wrong with you?

55:51.020 --> 55:53.580
We all pitched in, Mother,
and got you this.

55:54.880 --> 55:56.440
Now what is this?

55:58.480 --> 56:00.220
Okay.

56:02.740 --> 56:05.520
It's a cute wrapper.

56:05.620 --> 56:08.040
- I picked it out.
- Okay, you right.

56:15.680 --> 56:19.140
So it's a heart 'cause
that's what you are to us.

56:20.040 --> 56:21.300
Our heart.

56:30.410 --> 56:32.480
Excuse me. Thank you.

56:33.460 --> 56:34.740
I love y'all.

56:36.100 --> 56:37.540
But could we eat?

56:37.620 --> 56:38.759
- Oh.
- Boy.

56:38.760 --> 56:41.120
Yes, please.

56:42.530 --> 56:45.360
Daddy's hungry, hungry.

56:45.480 --> 56:47.460
- Pass the lo mein.
- Merry Christmas, y'all.

56:47.480 --> 56:49.140
Merry Christmas.
