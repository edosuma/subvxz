Hey!

00:07.441 --> 00:10.910
"Astronaut Dolphin Detective"
is coming on!

00:10.989 --> 00:14.313
That's my favorite show! Ha ha!

00:14.315 --> 00:15.648
Ha ha, yes!

00:15.650 --> 00:17.616
Captain, the evil space shrimp

00:17.618 --> 00:20.252
has constructed a giant
chainsaw spaceship.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.755
He's planning to cut the sun in half.

00:22.757 --> 00:25.286
A chainsaw spaceship?!
How does he fly it?

00:25.392 --> 00:27.860
- He controls it with his mind, sir.
- Of course!

00:27.862 --> 00:31.096
But why would the evil space
shrimp cut the sun in half?

00:31.098 --> 00:32.531
With the sun gone,

00:32.533 --> 00:35.034
he'll be able to keep his
nightclub open 24 hours a day.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.970
Sounds like a job for
Astronaut Dolphin Detective!

00:37.972 --> 00:39.571
But, sir, you had him arrested

00:39.573 --> 00:42.141
for defecating in the
space president's mouth.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.509
Get him out.

01:08.387 --> 01:09.935
I think I know what you're asking.

01:09.937 --> 01:13.361
And I'll tell you exactly
why we paired you two up.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.374
Roberts here is totally by the book.

01:15.376 --> 01:19.077
He's there to make sure you
don't color outside the lines.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.680
Buckle up. It's the law.

01:21.682 --> 01:25.117
So, how are you planning on
taking out the evil shrimp?

01:39.613 --> 01:42.634
Hmm. The evil shrimp's
nightclub is closed.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.871
What?! I can't understand you.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.906
Hey, clean... beep-beep...
Your windshield?!

01:47.908 --> 01:50.008
- Beep, beep, beep, hmm?
- Take a hike!

01:50.010 --> 01:50.696
Let's go!

01:50.748 --> 01:53.111
We might be able to take out
evil shrimp at his mansion.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.012
What?! Hey!

01:54.014 --> 01:56.548
No problem, Dolphin.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.450
Hey, that was my wallet!

01:58.452 --> 01:59.951
What?!

01:59.953 --> 02:02.854
Hold on! I brought a translation device.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.823
Now, what were you saying?

02:04.825 --> 02:06.892
Pbht! Pbht! Pbht!

02:06.894 --> 02:08.759
Darn thing must be broken.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.595
It's not broken, dick face.

02:10.597 --> 02:13.265
- Pbht!
- Hey, give me that back!

02:14.368 --> 02:17.042
Sir, no word yet from
Astronaut Dolphin Detective

02:17.105 --> 02:18.670
or Roberts, sir.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.672
Thanks for the update.

02:21.390 --> 02:23.442
- Mmm.
- I see you're eating, sir.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.943
I ordered some takeout.

02:24.945 --> 02:29.648
Oh. Ah. I am hungry, too.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.951
So I guess I'll just eat some snacks.

02:32.953 --> 02:36.121
Great. Make sure you put the
lids back on those snack jars

02:36.123 --> 02:36.988
when you're done.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.590
We don't want space roaches.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.025
No need to remind me.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.094
I always put the lids
back on the snack jars.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.930
Well,
somebody keeps leaving the lids off.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.431
Well, well, well, it wasn't me.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.313
Hey, speaking of food,

02:48.398 --> 02:50.202
I left my lasagna pan at your place

02:50.204 --> 02:52.904
after your dinner party last week.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.033
Oh.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.608
It'd be nice to have it back.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.643
Sure. Just say the word, sir.

02:58.645 --> 03:01.246
I'm saying the word
just by bringing it up.

03:01.248 --> 03:04.249
Mm, you're not exactly being direct,
sir.

03:04.251 --> 03:07.953
I want my lasagna pan.

03:07.955 --> 03:11.223
Oh! Good to know, sir.

03:25.404 --> 03:27.572
Hmm. Looks like there's no way in.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.974
What are you doing?

03:28.976 --> 03:31.743
Wow, a visual on the evil space shrimp

03:31.745 --> 03:33.645
from inside his own mansion.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.481
Eerie. It's like he's
looking right at us.

03:37.077 --> 03:39.785
Oh! Oh, yeah. You naughty little fish.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.486
Huh?

03:45.926 --> 03:49.861
Hey, baby, want to dance
before I head to your club?

03:49.863 --> 03:54.900
Master Shrimp,
I must remind you that any distractions

03:54.902 --> 03:58.470
could prove disastrous to
your telepathic control

03:58.472 --> 04:00.338
of the chainsaw spaceship.

04:00.340 --> 04:03.775
Hm!
Come see me in the champagne room later.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.678
And bring that shrimpy penis.

04:06.680 --> 04:10.816
Now we know we can take him
out at his nightclub later.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.118
Maybe you're smarter than I thought.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.352
Pbht!

04:19.363 --> 04:22.093
Hey, what? Why are we stopping here?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.128
Oh, yeah!

04:23.130 --> 04:24.563
Hey, man, let me get some, man!

04:24.565 --> 04:26.498
Let me have some, man.
Hey, let me hit that, yo!

04:26.500 --> 04:27.566
Let me hit that, man!

04:27.568 --> 04:28.934
Druggies.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.536
Astronaut Dolphin Detective,
we've got work to do.

04:32.452 --> 04:34.973
Well, if it isn't me old friend

04:34.975 --> 04:37.776
Astronaut Dolphin Detective!

04:37.778 --> 04:39.911
For your boo-boo,
come inside, brother man!

04:39.913 --> 04:41.646
- Lord, have mercy.
- Hey, what?!

04:41.648 --> 04:42.848
Hmm!

04:42.850 --> 04:44.683
You looking for a good time, baby?!

04:44.685 --> 04:45.851
Ugh!

04:54.613 --> 04:55.694
Captain, Deputy!

04:55.696 --> 04:58.496
Astronaut Dolphin Detective
stopped at a drug house.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.699
Damn it, Roberts!
You need to keep him in line.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.133
I'm sorry, Captain.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.369
Oh,
I didn't get a chance to say earlier,

05:04.371 --> 05:07.505
but I very much enjoyed your lasagna

05:07.507 --> 05:09.474
at Deputy's dinner party.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.876
Hmm.

05:11.257 --> 05:12.410
Okay, bye.

05:13.398 --> 05:15.280
What would you like me to do, sir,

05:15.282 --> 05:17.894
drop everything while
there's a chainsaw spaceship

05:17.916 --> 05:19.684
heading for the sun

05:19.686 --> 05:22.254
so I can go home and
get your lasagna pan?

05:22.256 --> 05:23.922
Mm-mm-mm.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.291
Come on! What?! Doing drugs?!

05:26.293 --> 05:28.326
Oi, oi, oi, oi!

05:28.328 --> 05:30.328
- I should report you to...
- Oi!

05:30.330 --> 05:32.330
Be careful how you speak to 'im.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.366
He 'appens to be the best drug cook

05:34.368 --> 05:36.902
this side of the Milky Way!

05:36.904 --> 05:39.504
His secret is that he's
already so packed to the gills

05:39.506 --> 05:42.007
with so much drug and drink

05:42.009 --> 05:43.975
that the space rock
become even more powerful

05:43.977 --> 05:45.577
once it pass through him!

05:45.579 --> 05:48.747
Here comes the little spoogy spooge!

05:48.749 --> 05:50.782
Ay, yi, yi, yi! Dry it out.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.183
Then quicker than you can say

05:52.185 --> 05:53.952
Bob's your uncle,

05:53.954 --> 05:56.087
you got yourself dolphin powder.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.555
Ugh!

05:57.557 --> 05:58.924
Come on! We need to go!

05:58.926 --> 06:00.425
Huh?

06:00.427 --> 06:02.460
- Oh, no! Is he overdosing?
- Oi!

06:02.462 --> 06:04.529
I know just what he need, man!

06:04.531 --> 06:05.964
Brup, brup, pull yourself!

06:05.966 --> 06:07.699
Of course!

06:07.701 --> 06:09.367
Dolphins need water!

06:09.369 --> 06:12.304
Oh, no. That was tequila!

06:13.941 --> 06:16.341
Nice parking, Dolphin.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.178
Ugh! Get yourself together.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.448
Lucky for you I brought
an extra disguise.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.816
Hey! What?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.284
You boys polizei?

06:26.286 --> 06:29.454
Because this one, he looks polizei.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.456
Oh, uh, well, uh...

06:31.458 --> 06:32.624
Huh?

06:32.626 --> 06:36.127
Well! No polizei would do that!

06:36.129 --> 06:39.564
Now I understand why you went
through all that partying...

06:39.566 --> 06:40.799
To get drugs.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.467
We'd need them to make it inside.

06:42.469 --> 06:46.004
Our target's headed
upstairs to the V.I.P.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.872
So what's our move?

06:47.874 --> 06:49.808
What?! Hey!

06:49.810 --> 06:52.510
Hey, dudes, I'm with the dolphin.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.045
No? Okay.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.247
All right, Astronaut Dolphin Detective,

06:56.249 --> 06:58.483
you've made it to the evil space shrimp.

06:58.485 --> 07:01.052
Now, how are you gonna take him out?

07:05.292 --> 07:08.593
Darn it, Astronaut Dolphin Detective!

07:08.595 --> 07:12.402
Well, maybe your wife could
bring the lasagna pan.

07:12.571 --> 07:16.201
Okay, sir, I'll just pull Gloria
away from watching the kids.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.437
I'm sure Tyler can drive
himself home from space soccer.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.673
Captain, Deputy,
Astronaut Dolphin Detective

07:21.675 --> 07:24.009
had a shot at the evil shrimp,
but he didn't take it!

07:24.011 --> 07:25.276
- What?!
- Huh?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.411
They're trying to kill boss!

07:26.413 --> 07:27.812
What?! Hey, no! Aah!

07:27.814 --> 07:30.048
Find that dolphin!

07:30.851 --> 07:31.516
Oh, no!

07:31.518 --> 07:34.519
The chainsaw spaceship is
about to cut the sun in half!

07:34.521 --> 07:35.553
What do we do?!

07:35.555 --> 07:38.223
There's nothing we can do, Deputy.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.026
It really puts things in perspective.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.147
I apologize, Deputy.

07:43.316 --> 07:47.232
I never should have made such a
big deal about the lasagna pa...

07:47.234 --> 07:50.468
Damn it! You forgot to put the
lids back on the snack jars!

07:50.470 --> 07:52.404
- What?!
- Now we have space roaches.

07:52.406 --> 07:55.273
I want my lasagna pan back!

07:55.275 --> 07:56.474
Hmm!

07:56.744 --> 07:59.711
Oh! You're so fun, Dolphin.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.780
Mmm!

08:01.782 --> 08:03.281
Oh! Oh, what?

08:03.283 --> 08:05.116
Oh.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.551
Okay.

08:06.553 --> 08:10.655
You're not as big as the shrimp,
but it will do.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.589
Huh?

08:11.591 --> 08:13.391
Kill that dolphin!

08:13.393 --> 08:14.559
Aah!

08:22.029 --> 08:24.002
Huh?

08:30.944 --> 08:34.212
I'm sorry, baby. You know I love you.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.513
Ow!

08:59.706 --> 09:01.573
Ha ha.

09:01.575 --> 09:02.607
Huh?

09:02.609 --> 09:05.076
Aah! No!

09:08.414 --> 09:10.982
Ah! Huh?

09:10.984 --> 09:13.351
Freeze! What the heck?

09:13.353 --> 09:15.487
Oh, no! The cops!

09:17.557 --> 09:19.991
Guess I have to do this myself.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.926
Oh!

09:21.928 --> 09:24.579
The sun, it's still in one piece.

09:24.906 --> 09:26.564
I guess the dolphin powder

09:26.566 --> 09:30.168
must have distracted evil
shrimp's mind long enough

09:30.170 --> 09:32.937
for the chainsaw spaceship
to go off course.

09:32.939 --> 09:35.240
Maybe you're smarter than I thought.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.242
- Oh!
- Good work, you two.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.145
But the space chainsaw
is now headed for Venus!

09:40.147 --> 09:42.413
We need evil space shrimp taken out!

09:42.415 --> 09:45.850
Right away, sir! What?!

09:45.852 --> 09:47.118
Darn!

09:48.587 --> 09:49.854
What are we doing back here?

09:49.856 --> 09:53.057
You had your chance to take him out,
but you didn't.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.692
Huh?

09:54.694 --> 09:56.294
What are you doing?

10:00.163 --> 10:03.134
What?! You could have just
done that the whole time!

10:03.136 --> 10:05.303
You just wanted to party all day.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.139
Well,
I'm gonna have to report you for this!

10:08.141 --> 10:12.510
I can't understand you!

10:14.114 --> 10:16.481
Ha! Okay, this ought to be good.

10:16.483 --> 10:19.384
What do you have to say for yourself?

10:22.389 --> 10:24.322
Right on time, Dolphin!

10:31.031 --> 10:33.198
Let met get that for you, Dolphin.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.968
Sir, Astronaut Dolphin
Detective murdered Roberts!

10:36.970 --> 10:38.536
Should we lock him up?

10:38.538 --> 10:41.439
Well, Astronaut Dolphin
Detective did save the sun.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.341
Maybe we could let this slide.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.909
Is that him on the phone?

10:44.911 --> 10:46.544
No, sir, it's my wife.

10:46.546 --> 10:50.348
She says Roberts has your lasagna pan.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.574
Damn it!
I never want to see that dolphin again!

10:53.626 --> 10:54.886
Lock him up!
