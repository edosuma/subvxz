00:00.149 --> 00:03.400
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island a

00:03.400 --> 00:05.020
deal with Nolan how does that strike it

00:05.020 --> 00:07.740
with mixed emotions it's time to quit

00:07.740 --> 00:08.999
the fighting I don't want to be an

00:08.999 --> 00:11.070
obstacle anymore welcome to the team

00:11.070 --> 00:15.110
ready to put it in the ground Fred right

00:15.110 --> 00:16.470
on your spot

00:16.470 --> 00:19.089
that looks like you it's definitely

00:19.089 --> 00:20.089
man-made

00:20.089 --> 00:22.189
there's a cavity in this slate and that

00:22.189 --> 00:23.929
would be the most important discovery

00:23.929 --> 00:27.419
monocot right there

00:27.419 --> 00:30.919
that's definitely Madame

00:30.919 --> 00:34.360
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:34.360 --> 00:36.130
where people have been looking for an

00:36.130 --> 00:39.900
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:39.900 --> 00:42.830
years so far they have found bits of

00:42.830 --> 00:46.420
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:46.420 --> 00:48.240
symbols carved into it

00:48.240 --> 00:52.810
even a 17th century Spanish coin to date

00:52.810 --> 00:56.260
six men have died trying to solve the

00:56.260 --> 00:57.300
mystery

00:57.300 --> 01:00.970
and according to legend one more will

01:00.970 --> 01:05.530
have to die before the treasure 
can be found

01:22.860 --> 01:26.380
on the mainland a short distance from

01:26.380 --> 01:30.170
the causeway that leads to Oak Island an

01:30.170 --> 01:33.960
important meeting is about to take place

01:33.960 --> 01:37.640
between Rick and Marty lagina and a man

01:37.640 --> 01:40.640
who has so far been shy to aid them in

01:40.640 --> 01:45.729
their search for treasure good come on

01:45.729 --> 01:49.810
in okay got everybody lined up here

01:49.810 --> 01:52.420
everybody's here yep okay I got you the

01:52.420 --> 01:54.460
best seat in the house oh there you go

01:54.460 --> 01:56.979
I can't complain for the laginas and

01:56.979 --> 01:59.130
their partners the meeting offers the

01:59.130 --> 02:02.340
possibility of both an end and a

02:02.340 --> 02:06.530
beginning an end to a decades-old feud

02:06.530 --> 02:08.429
with their Oak Island partner and fellow

02:08.429 --> 02:11.319
treasure hunter dan Blankenship and the

02:11.319 --> 02:14.340
beginning of a new era of cooperation

02:14.340 --> 02:17.629
and collaboration one which they hope

02:17.629 --> 02:20.879
will lead to solving a 220 year old

02:20.879 --> 02:21.879
mystery

02:21.879 --> 02:23.790
well I just want to say Fred thanks for

02:23.790 --> 02:25.920
you know coming on board we're eager to

02:25.920 --> 02:27.510
work with you because we know you have

02:27.510 --> 02:30.370
some sights over the years and you're

02:30.370 --> 02:34.829
talking many years 40 almost 50 years

02:34.829 --> 02:37.510
were two competing individuals and that

02:37.510 --> 02:40.219
was a competition in my mind's eye and

02:40.219 --> 02:42.400
I'm not saying I'm correct in that

02:42.400 --> 02:46.049
analysis but they were competing to

02:46.049 --> 02:47.159
solve the Oak Island mystery

02:47.159 --> 02:51.680
a land surveyor by trade Fred Nolan

02:51.680 --> 02:55.769
first visited Oak Island in 1958 after

02:55.769 --> 02:58.010
reading a book entitled B Oak Island

02:58.010 --> 03:01.379
mystery by Reginald Harris in 1961

03:01.379 --> 03:06.010
landowner Mr Chappell invited Nolan to

03:06.010 --> 03:10.180
come and survey the 140 acre Island

03:10.180 --> 03:12.459
while conducting his work he became

03:12.459 --> 03:14.790
convinced that the stories of buried

03:14.790 --> 03:18.150
treasure were true especially after

03:18.150 --> 03:20.000
observing and measuring several

03:20.000 --> 03:22.230
mysterious stone carvings and other

03:22.230 --> 03:24.900
markers that seemed to be hundreds of

03:24.900 --> 03:28.600
years old after buying land on the

03:28.600 --> 03:32.590
island in 1963 Fred spent the next

03:32.590 --> 03:35.219
several years actively engaged in the

03:35.219 --> 03:36.219
treasure hunt

03:36.219 --> 03:38.739
he even cooperated with rival treasure

03:38.739 --> 03:41.580
hunters dan Blankenship and David Tobias

03:41.580 --> 03:46.219
that is until further disputes over land

03:46.219 --> 03:48.819
caused the relationship to deteriorate

03:48.819 --> 03:51.409
into a series of bitter feuds and near

03:51.409 --> 03:54.949
violent confrontations I had learned

03:54.949 --> 03:59.849
over the years of a very rancorous and

03:59.849 --> 04:01.620
fractious relationship between mr.

04:01.620 --> 04:04.090
Blankenship and mr. Nolan and so my

04:04.090 --> 04:08.279
desire was I think it was our desire to

04:08.279 --> 04:10.549
heal the island to try to get a working

04:10.549 --> 04:13.089
relationship between ourselves because

04:13.089 --> 04:16.949
Dan is our partner and mr. Nolan so it's

04:16.949 --> 04:19.298
time to quit the fighting and cooperate

04:19.298 --> 04:22.210
right well

04:22.210 --> 04:24.039
it hasn't accomplished much no

04:24.039 --> 04:26.340
infighting yeah I don't want to be an

04:26.340 --> 04:28.680
obstacle anymore you know I'm yeah I'm

04:28.680 --> 04:33.360
too old for that now just a few days

04:33.360 --> 04:36.889
earlier Rick Marty and Craig tester met

04:36.889 --> 04:40.030
with dan Blankenship and his son day in

04:40.030 --> 04:42.440
order to get Dan's blessing on a deal to

04:42.440 --> 04:45.820
work with Fred so a deal with Nolan how

04:45.820 --> 04:48.419
does that strike you with mixed emotions

04:48.419 --> 04:50.340
to be quite honest with you because

04:50.340 --> 04:53.090
after all I've had dealings with Nolan

04:53.090 --> 04:54.800
than the past and the fact that you're

04:54.800 --> 04:57.409
even neighbors of didn't like him to

04:57.409 --> 05:01.650
sign something is very impressive to say

05:01.650 --> 05:04.650
the least we're really happy about this

05:04.650 --> 05:06.690
because it allows us to explore the

05:06.690 --> 05:10.420
whole island now the main thing on Oak

05:10.420 --> 05:13.080
Island far as I'm concerned is making a

05:13.080 --> 05:18.490
breakthrough right right you've got

05:18.490 --> 05:19.949
several sites you want to drill right

05:19.949 --> 05:21.270
we're gonna drill them together yeah

05:21.270 --> 05:23.800
yeah okay and you document it at all you

05:23.800 --> 05:25.840
got it all on a map we got a bat super

05:25.840 --> 05:29.050
we surveyed the whole island all right

05:29.050 --> 05:31.669
one evident and regretted it pops back

05:31.669 --> 05:33.169
and forth you know

05:33.169 --> 05:37.979
so anything that was around we picked up

05:37.979 --> 05:40.080
look I've known trust for eight years

05:40.080 --> 05:42.220
and I have asked him pointedly many

05:42.220 --> 05:45.129
times Fred what's your theory and he's

05:45.129 --> 05:49.199
always either politely or indelicately

05:49.199 --> 05:53.150
refused when the American Revolution

05:53.150 --> 05:56.930
starts the British general Astana and

05:56.930 --> 06:01.030
all this treasure done in Boston and

06:01.030 --> 06:02.639
they said well we're not gonna leave

06:02.639 --> 06:05.819
this treasure here so they sailed it all

06:05.819 --> 06:09.539
off to Halifax they knew it was safe

06:09.539 --> 06:12.639
there because Halifax was strongly

06:12.639 --> 06:16.879
British there's the 14th colony yet yeah

06:16.879 --> 06:21.060
in the late 1700s as political unrest

06:21.060 --> 06:22.860
was beginning to take place in the

06:22.860 --> 06:25.539
American colonies

06:25.539 --> 06:27.409
King George the third ordered his

06:27.409 --> 06:29.979
military generals to gather up as much

06:29.979 --> 06:33.020
gold silver and jewels as they could and

06:33.020 --> 06:37.259
send them back to England after loading

06:37.259 --> 06:40.039
four ships the British military sailed

06:40.039 --> 06:42.810
to Halifax in Nova Scotia and were

06:42.810 --> 06:44.789
ordered to keep the treasure under guard

06:44.789 --> 06:46.669
for the winter

06:46.669 --> 06:48.979
but according to Fred Nolan's theory a

06:48.979 --> 06:51.360
large portion of the precious cargo

06:51.360 --> 06:54.810
never made it back to the king a small

06:54.810 --> 06:57.669
group of officers conspired to hide it

06:57.669 --> 07:00.749
under by Oak Island and keep it both as

07:00.749 --> 07:03.530
compensation and an insurance policy

07:03.530 --> 07:07.039
especially if the colonists succeeded in

07:07.039 --> 07:09.360
gaining their independence and the

07:09.360 --> 07:12.180
ousted military might be forced to fend

07:12.180 --> 07:15.949
for themselves so where did it go nobody

07:15.949 --> 07:20.220
knows is the treasure still there on the

07:20.220 --> 07:21.220
island

07:21.220 --> 07:22.220
sure

07:22.220 --> 07:25.229
it's still there but sometimes you

07:25.229 --> 07:27.949
wonder if the place is full of treasure

07:27.949 --> 07:28.949
good let's find it

07:28.949 --> 07:31.330
yeah I think it's great that we're

07:31.330 --> 07:33.159
working together I really do I mean this

07:33.159 --> 07:35.849
is too big a puzzle yeah yeah an

07:35.849 --> 07:37.699
entirely different Fred Nolan walked in

07:37.699 --> 07:40.560
that door I think it finally makes sense

07:40.560 --> 07:43.229
to him to to look forward rather than

07:43.229 --> 07:46.020
backwards and that was extremely

07:46.020 --> 07:53.599
refreshing welcome to the team all right

07:53.599 --> 07:54.939
well let's quit talking let's go out in

07:54.939 --> 07:57.139
the field and start doing something yeah

07:57.139 --> 07:58.229
perfect

08:12.629 --> 08:14.789
Fred first of all I just want to say

08:14.789 --> 08:16.629
thanks for coming to the war room this

08:16.629 --> 08:19.389
is this is where all the magic happens

08:19.389 --> 08:25.840
Craig is here by high-tech high-tech yep

08:25.840 --> 08:28.409
okay you know we're very grateful that

08:28.409 --> 08:30.300
you brought your map and we'd love to

08:30.300 --> 08:32.510
get an understanding at least of where

08:32.510 --> 08:34.880
we're gonna go from here and the whys of

08:34.880 --> 08:37.169
it sure

08:37.169 --> 08:39.750
with his brother Marty away on business

08:39.750 --> 08:42.510
Rick lagina has invited Island resident

08:42.510 --> 08:45.060
and veteran treasure hunter Fred Nolan

08:45.060 --> 08:47.640
to join him and several members of the

08:47.640 --> 08:50.590
team for an important meeting because

08:50.590 --> 08:53.080
now that they've agreed to work together

08:53.080 --> 08:55.720
fred has finally offered to share many

08:55.720 --> 08:58.230
of his maps and artifacts along with

08:58.230 --> 09:00.370
much of his most closely guarded

09:00.370 --> 09:03.091
information it's Fred Nolan the man who

09:03.091 --> 09:06.210
spent 50 years of his life pursuing this

09:06.210 --> 09:08.370
sharing with us his 50 years of

09:08.370 --> 09:12.600
discovery that's amazing how many years

09:12.600 --> 09:16.140
work is this map represents 40 50 years

09:16.140 --> 09:18.310
Wow

09:18.310 --> 09:21.730
fred has data that we do not have and we

09:21.730 --> 09:25.250
cannot recreate fred was here in I don't

09:25.250 --> 09:28.270
know the earliest days but surely by 58

09:28.270 --> 09:30.310
he was here and he brought his skill set

09:30.310 --> 09:33.370
unlike anyone else in the 220-year

09:33.370 --> 09:36.520
search Fred Nolan first began actively

09:36.520 --> 09:39.010
trying to solve the Oak Island mystery

09:39.010 --> 09:44.350
back in 1961 but unlike many of the

09:44.350 --> 09:46.430
treasure hunters before him friend

09:46.430 --> 09:48.860
believed the way to solve the mystery

09:48.860 --> 09:50.920
was to examine the numerous strange

09:50.920 --> 09:53.200
clues and carvings that could be found

09:53.200 --> 09:56.270
on the surface rather than focusing only

09:56.270 --> 09:57.800
on the money pit

09:57.800 --> 10:01.200
he surveyed the entire island and made

10:01.200 --> 10:04.040
detailed maps such as this one that

10:04.040 --> 10:06.410
marked the location of dozens of

10:06.410 --> 10:09.330
mysterious stone markers there are a lot

10:09.330 --> 10:13.060
of marks like these ones here there

10:13.060 --> 10:16.230
boulders I think we know what they mean

10:16.230 --> 10:18.320
but we're not sure because here's the

10:18.320 --> 10:20.840
big boys here it is if there's anything

10:20.840 --> 10:21.840
down there

10:21.840 --> 10:23.960
there's got to be something here this

10:23.960 --> 10:26.030
point is one of the places where we

10:26.030 --> 10:28.180
intend to drill right yeah that's a hot

10:28.180 --> 10:31.290
spot okay you know I've been at it for

10:31.290 --> 10:32.530
so long now mm-hmm

10:32.530 --> 10:34.280
and if I didn't relate this kind of

10:34.280 --> 10:36.790
stuff who would put it together again

10:36.790 --> 10:39.640
exactly we're very grateful for your

10:39.640 --> 10:41.900
work I mean it's it's an incredible

10:41.900 --> 10:45.080
commitment of time energy resources

10:45.080 --> 10:47.730
money you're staring at it right here

10:47.730 --> 10:49.820
it's immaculate and this is only one of

10:49.820 --> 10:52.320
what 104 mmm

10:52.320 --> 10:56.700
104 yep but you're convinced that this

10:56.700 --> 11:01.830
point is where we should look next yep

11:01.830 --> 11:03.830
then let's head off get a good night's

11:03.830 --> 11:05.360
sleep and get back at it tomorrow what

11:05.360 --> 11:07.070
do you say I gotta ask my wife

11:20.470 --> 11:22.660
shortly after Marty's return the Oak

11:22.860 --> 11:25.400
Island team arrives at an area on Fred's

11:25.400 --> 11:28.320
property located near the center of the

11:28.320 --> 11:29.320
island

11:29.320 --> 11:35.110
okay here comes a rig you wanted to back

11:35.110 --> 11:37.370
down or forward

11:37.370 --> 11:39.640
today this is all about mr. Nolan you

11:39.640 --> 11:42.320
know the fact that we have been able to

11:42.320 --> 11:45.560
engage in a working relationship it kind

11:45.560 --> 11:48.660
of is momentous order bought to actually

11:48.660 --> 11:54.130
engage in a discovery process I think

11:54.130 --> 12:00.990
we're all amped up

12:00.990 --> 12:02.800
while drilling in this area several

12:02.800 --> 12:05.630
years ago Fred Nolan believed he had

12:05.630 --> 12:08.720
found an underground cave or cavern some

12:08.720 --> 12:12.320
ten feet beneath the surface it had

12:12.320 --> 12:14.680
always been the 87 year old treasure

12:14.680 --> 12:17.610
hunters wish to revisit the area with a

12:17.610 --> 12:20.220
more powerful drill rig and try to

12:20.220 --> 12:26.360
replicate his findings now with the help

12:26.360 --> 12:28.790
of the laginas and their partners

12:28.790 --> 12:33.110
Fred's wish has come true that's quite a

12:33.110 --> 12:35.840
ways up there we could probably get set

12:35.840 --> 12:39.610
up as far as this all goes trees will be

12:39.610 --> 12:44.200
another another scenario although the

12:44.200 --> 12:46.590
area around the marked drill site is

12:46.590 --> 12:49.350
clear on the ground the canopy of trees

12:49.350 --> 12:52.060
overhead poses a real obstacle for the

12:52.060 --> 12:55.160
drill rig a number of branches will need

12:55.160 --> 12:58.310
to be cleared to bring the excavator

12:58.310 --> 13:01.240
down here knock those off

13:22.940 --> 13:24.500
you know that was just an easy way to do

13:24.600 --> 13:26.140
it to knock those branches off with the

13:26.140 --> 13:27.140
excavator

13:27.140 --> 13:42.080
can you get that

13:42.080 --> 13:54.750
all right yeah if I had taken off in

13:54.750 --> 13:56.200
that direction I would have gotten hit

13:56.200 --> 13:57.790
you shouldn't have been there to start

13:57.790 --> 13:59.130
with and I should have known where the

13:59.130 --> 14:01.120
boom was and not hit it

14:01.120 --> 14:03.160
it was a double mistake all's well that

14:03.160 --> 14:07.120
ends well yeah fine exactly 22 - lets go

14:07.120 --> 14:08.120
time's a-wasting

14:08.120 --> 14:13.130
now that the drilling rig has the room

14:13.130 --> 14:15.930
it needs to set up the operation can

14:15.930 --> 14:19.070
finally begin

14:19.070 --> 14:20.810
that's that right there right that

14:20.810 --> 14:24.230
statute here your honor

14:24.230 --> 14:27.260
but will the team really find evidence

14:27.260 --> 14:29.950
of a man-made chamber or treasure tunnel

14:29.950 --> 14:36.370
lying deep underground

14:36.370 --> 14:38.370
what we've heard about this spot is that

14:38.370 --> 14:41.810
it's in Slate and I don't know of any

14:41.810 --> 14:44.450
way a cavity can develop and slate

14:44.450 --> 14:48.430
naturally so if we do hit such a thing

14:48.430 --> 14:50.300
the odds of being man-made are very high

14:50.300 --> 14:51.670
in my opinion and that would be very

14:51.670 --> 14:53.270
exciting perfect

14:53.270 --> 14:57.980
couldn't get any closer one of the many

14:57.980 --> 15:00.110
interesting geological characteristics

15:00.110 --> 15:03.040
of Oak Island is the fact that each of

15:03.040 --> 15:06.120
its two halves are composed of two very

15:06.120 --> 15:08.530
different kinds of bedrock the eastern

15:08.530 --> 15:12.240
side where the money pit and 10x are

15:12.240 --> 15:14.320
located is composed of anhydride

15:14.320 --> 15:18.110
limestone a hard calcium based substance

15:18.110 --> 15:19.950
that is usually formed over a long

15:19.950 --> 15:22.440
period of time by the evaporation of

15:22.440 --> 15:26.980
salt water the western side however is

15:26.980 --> 15:29.620
made up of finely layered but highly

15:29.620 --> 15:32.370
compacted slate a low grade metamorphic

15:32.370 --> 15:35.580
rock that is created over time when clay

15:35.580 --> 15:38.550
or volcanic ash is subjected to enormous

15:38.550 --> 15:40.590
pressure

15:40.590 --> 15:43.030
unlike an hide right which can crumble

15:43.030 --> 15:45.750
and separate if exposed to groundwater

15:45.750 --> 15:48.100
slate is more highly layered and

15:48.100 --> 15:50.950
compacted if the team drills through

15:50.950 --> 15:53.970
slate and into a void it could mean they

15:53.970 --> 15:56.240
have located a man-made tunnel or

15:56.240 --> 15:57.240
chamber

15:57.240 --> 16:00.370
don't quote me on the verbage but this

16:00.370 --> 16:03.710
is a very important site fred's instead

16:03.710 --> 16:08.000
I've been sitting on this far too long I

16:08.000 --> 16:12.010
want to get this done

16:12.010 --> 16:21.370
oh you don't look just about ready to

16:21.370 --> 16:30.730
put it in the ground thread right on

16:30.730 --> 16:33.070
your spot

16:33.070 --> 16:41.260
the bedrock should be right caliber 12

16:41.260 --> 16:44.770
it'll be interesting

16:44.770 --> 16:48.000
Rick Marty and the Oak Island team have

16:48.000 --> 16:50.260
just begun their first joint drilling

16:50.260 --> 16:51.260
operation

16:51.260 --> 16:54.060
with Fred Nolan the man who'd like his

16:54.060 --> 16:57.440
rival dan Blankenship has spent the past

16:57.440 --> 17:00.250
five decades and much of his fortune

17:00.250 --> 17:02.470
trying to solve the Oak Island mystery

17:02.470 --> 17:15.290
according to Fred's detailed records the

17:15.290 --> 17:18.230
drill bit should hit a mysterious void

17:18.230 --> 17:20.490
after reaching a depth of approximately

17:20.490 --> 17:24.150
10 feet there's a cavity in this slate

17:24.150 --> 17:25.560
that would be the most important

17:25.560 --> 17:26.560
discovery

17:26.560 --> 17:34.660
Anoka to date

17:34.660 --> 17:43.290
oh six more

17:43.290 --> 17:46.060
you can't imagine how many hours I've

17:46.060 --> 17:48.670
spent hoping that a drill strain will

17:48.670 --> 17:51.340
drop rapidly watching the top drive come

17:51.340 --> 17:54.200
down the derrick you know hoping it'll

17:54.200 --> 17:57.790
start going like that and that would be

17:57.790 --> 17:59.420
as it enters a cavity

18:32.220 --> 18:34.750
metal could the drillbit have found

18:34.750 --> 18:36.790
something related to the underground

18:36.790 --> 18:39.570
chamber Fred Nolan believes he found on

18:39.570 --> 18:45.100
this site years ago in 1897 after

18:45.100 --> 18:47.630
finding what he believed to be a 7-foot

18:47.630 --> 18:50.490
tall wooden vault buried at a depth of

18:50.490 --> 18:54.480
153 feet inside the money pit drill

18:54.480 --> 18:56.790
operator William Chappell hid an

18:56.790 --> 19:00.640
impenetrable iron obstruction at 171

19:00.640 --> 19:04.160
feet both Chappell and his employer

19:04.160 --> 19:06.810
Frederick Blair believed that the iron

19:06.810 --> 19:08.800
plate could likely have been placed

19:08.800 --> 19:11.040
there to protect the original treasure

19:11.040 --> 19:14.560
vault although several efforts were made

19:14.560 --> 19:17.210
to excavate the area and reach both the

19:17.210 --> 19:19.640
wooden vault and the mysterious iron

19:19.640 --> 19:22.440
object repeated flooding posed an

19:22.440 --> 19:25.110
insurmountable problem and after two

19:25.110 --> 19:27.520
more years of trying the entire

19:27.520 --> 19:29.920
operation was abandoned in 1899

19:29.920 --> 19:35.440
but 10 feet or so they he thinks he

19:35.440 --> 19:38.210
might have hidden metal so we're gonna

19:38.210 --> 19:42.020
run the camera down see if you can see

19:42.020 --> 19:44.720
what's blocking the way in an attempt to

19:44.720 --> 19:46.760
determine what the drill bit is struck

19:46.760 --> 19:49.490
Jordan Rogers is putting a small

19:49.490 --> 19:52.150
high-definition camera down the hole

19:52.150 --> 19:53.910
which the team can monitor from the

19:53.910 --> 20:00.630
surface come on share share and share

20:00.630 --> 20:01.680
alike

20:01.680 --> 20:06.920
I can't tell Peter down

20:06.920 --> 20:09.150
that's definitely met

20:09.150 --> 20:11.360
the first hole we drilled the Fred

20:11.360 --> 20:13.540
Jordan got his rig down and at about

20:13.540 --> 20:15.370
eleven feet he was drilling on metal

20:15.370 --> 20:18.480
okay so that became promising how deep

20:18.480 --> 20:20.830
are you

20:20.830 --> 20:31.860
do you think you can pound pipe past it

20:31.860 --> 20:34.150
Jordan will now attempt to avoid the

20:34.150 --> 20:36.410
metal obstruction by drilling further

20:36.410 --> 20:48.410
into the slate bedrock

20:48.410 --> 20:49.920
we had Jordan run some casing and we

20:49.920 --> 20:52.220
think we got by this metal and then we

20:52.220 --> 20:53.940
drilled down to 30 feet and we did not

20:53.940 --> 20:57.170
hit any cavity so that was disappointing

20:57.170 --> 21:00.980
after drilling to a depth far beyond

21:00.980 --> 21:03.040
where Fred Nolan believes he found a

21:03.040 --> 21:05.980
cavity line underneath a slate layer

21:05.980 --> 21:09.290
Rick Marty and the team decide to change

21:09.290 --> 21:18.150
their entire method

21:18.150 --> 21:19.150
yeah I mean I think I could do it

21:19.150 --> 21:20.150
yesterday they're worth digging well we

21:20.150 --> 21:21.840
might as well put this to bed for sure

21:21.840 --> 21:24.000
put it for sure I I agree quick and

21:24.000 --> 21:26.390
we're only looking at 12 feet yeah I can

21:26.390 --> 21:29.500
dig that pretty quick

21:29.500 --> 21:38.970
I'd say this is where I want to be just

21:38.970 --> 21:41.360
a ball right

21:41.360 --> 21:46.150
we'll go ahead and start here

21:46.150 --> 21:49.340
my older swing achillea

21:49.340 --> 21:52.540
you were a surgeon

21:52.540 --> 21:55.540
I was sure that excavator would have no

21:55.540 --> 21:58.430
trouble getting down to 11 12 13 feet

21:58.430 --> 22:00.300
and initially it didn't I mean it's a

22:00.300 --> 22:01.300
very powerful machine

22:01.300 --> 22:06.480
we'll find that deal boys so far Marty

22:06.480 --> 22:09.100
has been unable to find either a slate

22:09.100 --> 22:11.809
covered cavern or the mysterious metal

22:11.809 --> 22:15.480
object that stops their drill that frog

22:15.480 --> 22:18.970
baby frustrated he now begins to dig on

22:18.970 --> 22:22.130
the other side of Jordans drill casing

22:22.130 --> 22:24.230
of the pipe went off that way

22:24.230 --> 22:30.240
shouldn't I be looking over here

22:30.240 --> 22:41.530
gray pants late on that side now too

22:41.530 --> 22:48.000
so we didn't find the metal now Oh deep

22:48.000 --> 22:51.420
is it okay follow that 10 12 feet I

22:51.420 --> 22:52.670
should be there

22:52.670 --> 22:55.160
so first hole we went in and to see if

22:55.160 --> 22:56.900
we could find this offending piece of

22:56.900 --> 23:01.700
metal and what didn't find it so I we

23:01.700 --> 23:09.590
don't know what that's all about

23:09.590 --> 23:24.110
that looks like you

23:24.110 --> 23:27.630
that look like - you wanna walk on down

23:27.630 --> 23:28.630
yeah

23:28.630 --> 23:29.630
while excavating the site on Fred

23:29.630 --> 23:32.570
Nolan's property near the middle of Oak

23:32.570 --> 23:34.840
Island the team has just found what

23:34.840 --> 23:39.260
could very well be an important clue was

23:39.260 --> 23:41.580
obviously not a piece of shale it's not

23:41.580 --> 23:45.050
a piece of bedrock not a stone can you

23:45.050 --> 23:48.310
bring it out yeah I don't know that

23:48.310 --> 23:49.310
means anything

23:49.310 --> 23:53.780
pointing thank you

23:53.780 --> 24:02.510
yeah definitely pointed look good bond

24:02.510 --> 24:08.370
Craig take a look at this very strange

24:08.370 --> 24:09.370
would Rick

24:09.370 --> 24:14.740
I mean look how nice and shaped it is

24:14.740 --> 24:20.990
most definitely man-made a sharpened

24:20.990 --> 24:23.700
piece of wood buried approximately 10

24:23.700 --> 24:25.320
feet underground

24:25.320 --> 24:27.150
it's very apparent that it was unusual

24:27.150 --> 24:30.890
item and then I saw where it had been

24:30.890 --> 24:34.230
carved into a point and it was apparent

24:34.230 --> 24:36.440
that you know at that depth it shouldn't

24:36.440 --> 24:37.440
be there

24:37.440 --> 24:40.890
it looks pretty well-preserved what if

24:40.890 --> 24:42.700
it marks something originally was cut

24:42.700 --> 24:45.120
off it's all we got

24:45.120 --> 24:47.980
okay but let's call it a night I agree

24:47.980 --> 24:51.800
although the team's first operation with

24:51.800 --> 24:54.590
Fred Nolan may not event it with a major

24:54.590 --> 24:57.460
breakthrough finding the piece of carved

24:57.460 --> 25:00.250
wood is a promising sign that their new

25:00.250 --> 25:02.429
cooperative agreement with him could

25:02.429 --> 25:04.870
soon lead to more and even greater

25:04.870 --> 25:05.870
discoveries

25:05.870 --> 25:19.050
all right Rick let's get our prize

25:19.050 --> 25:35.000
today's prize okay you got it

25:35.000 --> 25:36.820
worker they did hey now you're doing

25:36.820 --> 25:39.110
did you see yeah Craig you have a

25:39.110 --> 25:45.700
present for you interesting phone that

25:45.700 --> 25:48.170
about six feet down in the hole we just

25:48.170 --> 25:50.980
drilled I'll be done what we did over at

25:50.980 --> 25:53.480
Nolan's was we drilled first we hit some

25:53.480 --> 25:55.929
metal you found this and the metal in

25:55.929 --> 25:59.600
the same hole yes yes well when we dug

25:59.600 --> 26:01.610
with the excavator we could never find

26:01.610 --> 26:10.260
the metal again seesaw marks in it you

26:10.260 --> 26:14.940
think that means it's a real reason not

26:14.940 --> 26:17.320
necessarily they use songs for a long

26:17.320 --> 26:19.740
time Paris I mean all the wooden ship

26:19.740 --> 26:22.110
that they built they had the Behaim song

26:22.110 --> 26:24.240
near what's the chances of having

26:24.240 --> 26:26.450
something like that they're obviously

26:26.450 --> 26:29.750
shaped to be in the ground and buried

26:29.750 --> 26:33.840
four or five or six feet under a wooden

26:33.840 --> 26:35.929
post caught in such a way as to be

26:35.929 --> 26:38.730
driven like a stake into the ground

26:38.730 --> 26:42.660
could it have been some sort of marker

26:42.660 --> 26:44.860
put there centuries ago by the same

26:44.860 --> 26:47.140
people who placed nine layers of

26:47.140 --> 26:49.590
similarly cut wooden posts in the

26:49.590 --> 26:52.730
original money pit

26:52.730 --> 26:53.809
we don't want to find something without

26:53.809 --> 26:57.300
telling you I appreciate all right let

26:57.300 --> 26:59.230
you get back to we locket okay

26:59.230 --> 27:01.290
Oak Island did its usual tease you a

27:01.290 --> 27:03.230
little bit make you come back kind of

27:03.230 --> 27:04.620
like getting a really nice golf shot you

27:04.620 --> 27:06.130
know when you're a hacker it makes you

27:06.130 --> 27:09.630
come back and oak island is good at that

27:09.630 --> 27:11.790
here's your exercise for the day thank

27:11.790 --> 27:13.640
you I really appreciate that

27:13.640 --> 27:25.290
after a week of new investigations and

27:25.290 --> 27:28.540
possible breakthroughs Rick lagina is

27:28.540 --> 27:32.460
bringing a special guest to Oak Island

27:32.460 --> 27:34.510
someone who has not been there in more

27:34.510 --> 27:37.660
than 50 years I have so many questions

27:37.660 --> 27:40.250
they're gonna come not in chronological

27:40.250 --> 27:43.960
order I'll have to take it as it is

27:43.960 --> 27:45.910
David McDonald is the author of the

27:45.910 --> 27:50.690
January 1965 Reader's Digest article oak

27:50.690 --> 27:52.920
islands mysterious money pit

27:52.920 --> 27:56.230
the same article that not only fueled

27:56.230 --> 27:58.640
the childhood imaginations of Rick and

27:58.640 --> 28:02.501
Marty lagina but also inspired a 42 year

28:02.501 --> 28:05.990
old contractor from Florida named dan

28:05.990 --> 28:08.350
blankenship the way your article

28:08.350 --> 28:10.770
presented the story it was like a puzzle

28:10.770 --> 28:13.340
it wasn't so much a treasure hunt as a

28:13.340 --> 28:15.350
puzzle I would hope that that one moved

28:15.350 --> 28:18.130
you or would have been the general

28:18.130 --> 28:21.240
content of it yes what does it add up to

28:21.240 --> 28:24.910
exactly it still adds up to a mystery

28:24.910 --> 28:28.059
because of the things you don't know yes

28:28.059 --> 28:31.679
you mentioned that your father had

28:31.679 --> 28:33.760
gotten you interested in the story long

28:33.760 --> 28:37.630
ago well by the time I was five or six

28:37.630 --> 28:40.130
years old everybody in all that age

28:40.130 --> 28:43.960
hears about Oak Island have always known

28:43.960 --> 28:46.020
that there was a place where they kept

28:46.020 --> 28:48.559
digging for money somebody's gonna find

28:48.559 --> 28:50.210
it yes

28:50.210 --> 28:55.360
born and raised in nearby Halifax David

28:55.360 --> 28:57.530
MacDonald was a freelance writer when in

28:57.530 --> 29:01.210
1964 he was hired to do a piece on the

29:01.210 --> 29:04.940
search for treasure on Oak Island after

29:04.940 --> 29:07.309
spending several days talking with

29:07.309 --> 29:09.320
treasure hunter Robert Restall and his

29:09.320 --> 29:12.460
family he came away convinced that many

29:12.460 --> 29:14.390
of the various stories concerning the

29:14.390 --> 29:15.720
fabled treasure hunt

29:15.720 --> 29:18.420
were true and that the rest dolls were

29:18.420 --> 29:20.790
within weeks of actually solving the

29:20.790 --> 29:25.330
mystery here we are everyone is actually

29:25.330 --> 29:29.760
gathered in what we call the War Room

29:29.760 --> 29:32.380

David MacDonald caused all this trouble

30:03.920 --> 30:06.730
see right there thank you

30:06.730 --> 30:09.500
after 50 years author David McDonough's

30:09.500 --> 30:11.700
the man who wrote the influential

30:11.700 --> 30:13.760
article about Oak Island in The Reader's

30:13.760 --> 30:16.450
Digest has returned to share his

30:16.450 --> 30:21.160
memories with Rick Marty and the team oh

30:21.160 --> 30:24.130
my stop all right well welcome to Oak

30:24.130 --> 30:28.179
Island thank you very much well

30:28.179 --> 30:35.360
there it is Wow a bomb that's the one I

30:35.360 --> 30:38.799
remember like yesterday reading this and

30:38.799 --> 30:43.840
I was fascinated as young boys growing

30:43.840 --> 30:46.750
up in Michigan's Upper Peninsula Rick

30:46.750 --> 30:49.290
and Marty lagina loved to read stories

30:49.290 --> 30:52.340
of mystery and adventure even though

30:52.340 --> 30:55.290
David MacDonald's article ran for only

30:55.290 --> 30:58.960
five pages the combination of the story

30:58.960 --> 31:00.970
coupled with vivid graphics showing a

31:00.970 --> 31:03.950
mysterious money pit became indelibly

31:03.950 --> 31:08.160
etched in rick lagina's imagination

31:08.160 --> 31:10.020
what's a bigger mystery than Oak Island

31:10.020 --> 31:14.310
220 years of search incredible

31:14.310 --> 31:16.820
possibilities in terms of the solution

31:16.820 --> 31:18.970
mystery wonderment questioning I mean

31:18.970 --> 31:20.720
that's what grabbed me when I read that

31:20.720 --> 31:23.030
article and here was the guy who

31:23.030 --> 31:24.750
actually wrote The Reader's Digest

31:24.750 --> 31:27.250
article the one that so enamored him

31:27.250 --> 31:30.070
when he was a young man and dragged his

31:30.070 --> 31:32.299
younger brother along meaning me I'm

31:32.299 --> 31:35.090
saying I had to force-feed you that yes

31:35.090 --> 31:38.130
that's what I'm saying it's your fault

31:38.130 --> 31:40.220
suppose that article had never been

31:40.220 --> 31:42.590
written do you think you wouldn't be

31:42.590 --> 31:44.520
here

31:44.520 --> 31:48.000
besides Saturday morning I read the

31:48.000 --> 31:51.160
article and I handed it back to my wife

31:51.160 --> 31:53.790
and I said read this in so many words

31:53.790 --> 31:58.390
you said so why you know I said number

31:58.390 --> 32:00.880
one I said there's treasure on Oak

32:00.880 --> 32:02.700
Island number two I said I'm gonna be

32:02.700 --> 32:06.299
instrumental in getting it beginning

32:06.299 --> 32:08.080
your story but not the end

32:08.080 --> 32:12.480
no the ends not written yet yeah so what

32:12.480 --> 32:14.179
led you to write that story

32:14.179 --> 32:15.900
I've always wondered that had you been

32:15.900 --> 32:18.010
writing for The Reader's Digest I had

32:18.010 --> 32:20.440
done a couple of pieces for them and

32:20.440 --> 32:22.760
they wanted me to do a piece on Oak

32:22.760 --> 32:23.760
Island

32:23.760 --> 32:26.110
so I researched Oak Island I do know

32:26.110 --> 32:28.191
that you met the restaurant and they're

32:28.191 --> 32:30.600
the first ones I met oh yes I'm at the

32:30.600 --> 32:31.600
Rex halls

32:31.600 --> 32:33.660
what were your impressions of the rest

32:33.660 --> 32:37.140
all's well I think he was he was very

32:37.140 --> 32:40.380
careful about what he said I think and I

32:40.380 --> 32:42.861
understand that you're digging for a

32:42.861 --> 32:45.000
treasure and somebody's asking you

32:45.000 --> 32:47.549
questions you probably want to be

32:47.549 --> 32:51.370
careful

32:51.370 --> 32:53.740
when David McDonald visited Oak Island

32:53.740 --> 32:58.150
in 1964 Robert Russell and his family

32:58.150 --> 33:00.740
had been trying to solve the mystery for

33:00.740 --> 33:03.840
nearly five years living in harsh

33:03.840 --> 33:06.340
conditions the rest dolls worked

33:06.340 --> 33:09.570
tirelessly mostly focusing their work on

33:09.570 --> 33:12.110
Smith's Cove where they found additional

33:12.110 --> 33:14.720
evidence of the five box trains that

33:14.720 --> 33:19.340
were first discovered in 18-49 Robert

33:19.340 --> 33:22.630
and his son Bobby jr. believed they were

33:22.630 --> 33:25.570
very close to discovering something not

33:25.570 --> 33:29.830
only of great monetary value but also of

33:29.830 --> 33:31.600
extraordinary historical significance

33:31.600 --> 33:37.480
but on August 17th 1965 just eight

33:37.480 --> 33:39.710
months following the publication of

33:39.710 --> 33:42.570
David MacDonald's article Robert rest

33:42.570 --> 33:45.090
all his son and two members of their

33:45.090 --> 33:48.510
team died after being exposed to deadly

33:48.510 --> 33:51.950
h2s gas in one of oak islands many mine

33:51.950 --> 33:54.799
shafts

33:54.799 --> 33:58.850
we've played a small role in this but

33:58.850 --> 34:00.470
the people who have committed their

34:00.470 --> 34:04.080
lives passions energies monies the

34:04.080 --> 34:06.580
restaurants who paid the ultimate price

34:06.580 --> 34:11.699
I think they've not gotten their due

34:11.699 --> 34:13.819
well David you didn't change the history

34:13.819 --> 34:15.319
of the world probably but you certainly

34:15.319 --> 34:17.529
changed the history of Oak Island yeah

34:17.529 --> 34:19.319
there's no question about that things

34:19.319 --> 34:21.039
would be a lot different had this not

34:21.039 --> 34:24.259
been written I guess yes well you're

34:24.259 --> 34:26.221
directly responsible for these two

34:26.221 --> 34:28.940
characters being here for sure at the

34:28.940 --> 34:33.789
minimum yeah and I want to say thank you

34:33.789 --> 34:34.789
very much

34:34.789 --> 34:45.329
I never shake his hand

34:45.329 --> 35:00.930
we're thinking over here Marty on the

35:00.930 --> 35:03.160
inside

35:03.160 --> 35:09.239
right about here

35:09.239 --> 35:11.099
we're here because this is a historic

35:11.099 --> 35:13.079
place it's a storied place and we're

35:13.079 --> 35:16.190
here to not only respect the past but to

35:16.190 --> 35:18.769
respect the future in to that extent

35:18.769 --> 35:20.260
we're gonna put a time capsule in the

35:20.260 --> 35:23.250
ground at the Bicentennial memorial to

35:23.250 --> 35:25.220
mark the 50th anniversary of the

35:25.220 --> 35:27.470
Reader's Digest article that changed

35:27.470 --> 35:30.230
their lives as well as the two hundred

35:30.230 --> 35:32.190
and twentieth year of the oak island

35:32.190 --> 35:35.279
treasure hunt Rick and Marty lagina

35:35.279 --> 35:37.579
along with their partners have decided

35:37.579 --> 35:39.749
to gather near the causeway at the

35:39.749 --> 35:44.420
islands entrance I think first of all we

35:44.420 --> 35:48.079
all my opinion a collective thank you to

35:48.079 --> 35:50.729
David for writing that article because

35:50.729 --> 35:53.200
he's the reason why we are all here I

35:53.200 --> 35:58.130
think then let's thank Daniel for paving

35:58.130 --> 36:04.200
the way yes I agree it's appealing

36:04.200 --> 36:07.349
leaving a signature if you will for

36:07.349 --> 36:08.910
someone else to read fifty years from

36:08.910 --> 36:12.359
now it's appealing using a piece of

36:12.359 --> 36:14.900
drill casing that dave blankenship has

36:14.900 --> 36:17.869
fabricated into a time capsule each

36:17.869 --> 36:20.329
member of the Oak Island team makes a

36:20.329 --> 36:22.670
contribution they hope a future

36:22.670 --> 36:24.329
generation might find

36:24.329 --> 36:27.450
well I'm always always waiting for crown

36:27.450 --> 36:35.799
time so I'm giving somebody some crowns

36:35.799 --> 36:37.599
okay here's mine this says from Martin G

36:37.599 --> 36:40.690
lagina to the future I have made several

36:40.690 --> 36:42.170
predictions about what the world will

36:42.170 --> 36:44.640
look like and I'm asking whoever finds

36:44.640 --> 36:47.320
it to send this to my kids and I've

36:47.320 --> 36:50.009
enclosed $10 Canadian for postage and

36:50.009 --> 36:57.349
handling I will insert it well this is a

36:57.349 --> 37:01.920
copy of the digest with the article in

37:01.920 --> 37:03.299
this my goodness

37:03.299 --> 37:06.210
and it's the American cop but it still

37:06.210 --> 37:13.519
got a few true words yeah I guess now

37:13.519 --> 37:15.430
it's my turn but I'm gonna kind of I've

37:15.430 --> 37:16.970
thought about it for a long time and I'm

37:16.970 --> 37:18.690
gonna kind of break tradition because I

37:18.690 --> 37:21.519
kind of wrote a little letter it's it's

37:21.519 --> 37:23.289
to the people that will open this and

37:23.289 --> 37:27.200
it's it's to all of us it says dear Oak

37:27.200 --> 37:29.019
Island searchers we have met so many

37:29.019 --> 37:30.799
gracious and wonderful people it is

37:30.799 --> 37:33.099
impossible to acknowledge and thank

37:33.099 --> 37:35.710
everyone though I would try especially

37:35.710 --> 37:36.710
wish to say to

37:36.710 --> 37:43.170
my brother and friend that I and I do

37:43.170 --> 37:45.489
not use the term lightly I treasure this

37:45.489 --> 37:49.039
time we have spent together to Darrin

37:49.039 --> 37:50.210
blowing could ship by fuel

37:50.210 --> 37:55.369
if y'all have known in my whole life and

37:55.369 --> 37:57.650
thank you for allowing me into your

37:57.650 --> 38:00.830
special world to david blankenship i can

38:00.830 --> 38:05.000
say many things not all good however it

38:05.000 --> 38:06.759
is most important to me that i call you

38:06.759 --> 38:09.279
my friend and I hope you considered me

38:09.279 --> 38:12.579
yours I conclude by wishing you and

38:12.579 --> 38:14.920
yours meaning the people who open this

38:14.920 --> 38:16.950
the best of luck and good wishes as the

38:16.950 --> 38:20.239
Ojai story continues to evolve take care

38:20.239 --> 38:21.729
of one another as that is the real

38:21.729 --> 38:22.729
treasure in life

38:22.729 --> 38:41.539
ciao if we don't succeed and somebody

38:41.539 --> 38:43.220
looks at those items fifty years from

38:43.220 --> 38:45.569
now I I would hope they realize that

38:45.569 --> 38:47.229
there is an emotional component to this

38:47.229 --> 38:49.720
this isn't just a treasure hunt it's not

38:49.720 --> 38:52.330
just about recovering wealth there's an

38:52.330 --> 38:54.579
emotional component to this and I would

38:54.579 --> 38:57.569
hope that by looking at those items they

38:57.569 --> 39:00.470
would connect in that way

39:00.470 --> 39:02.630
now that everyone has placed an item

39:02.630 --> 39:05.749
into the time capsule dave blankenship

39:05.749 --> 39:07.410
welds it closed

39:07.410 --> 39:09.869
keeping it airtight for what could be

39:09.869 --> 39:12.279
its next several decades underground

39:12.279 --> 39:16.230
okay Rick don't know see young guys do

39:16.230 --> 39:19.940
it all right I like that

39:19.940 --> 39:24.009
I thought it was a very appropriate

39:24.009 --> 39:25.559
putting it by the Bicentennial Memorial

39:25.559 --> 39:27.930
I mean what more appropriate place could

39:27.930 --> 39:28.930
there be

39:28.930 --> 39:30.249
you know people come when they come on

39:30.249 --> 39:32.279
these tours they go to that Manya and

39:32.279 --> 39:36.039
they realize just how much time I mean

39:36.039 --> 39:37.960
the world's longest-running treasure

39:37.960 --> 39:40.670
hunt you know why not put it there

39:40.670 --> 39:42.279
okay I think our work here is done

39:42.279 --> 39:44.619
gentlemen at Lisa well done let's have a

39:44.619 --> 39:50.700
round of applause for us shall we Rick -

39:50.700 --> 39:53.119
fifty years from now

39:53.119 --> 39:56.880
done done I think ultimately the old

39:56.880 --> 39:59.069
kind of mystery will be solved every

39:59.069 --> 40:01.660
time you put shovel the earth every time

40:01.660 --> 40:04.999
the drill bites soil you think okay this

40:04.999 --> 40:07.950
could be it it's taken a lot longer than

40:07.950 --> 40:10.190
I thought and it's harder than I thought

40:10.190 --> 40:14.900
this nut is hard to crack but so what

40:14.900 --> 40:19.049
and I say we are gonna get this that's

40:19.049 --> 40:23.270
my buddy all right fine I'll go with

40:23.270 --> 40:25.460
that it's that simple there we're not

40:25.460 --> 40:26.940
giving up

40:26.940 --> 40:30.089
for Rick Marty and their partners today

40:30.089 --> 40:32.559
marks the end of a very productive week

40:32.559 --> 40:35.760
not only have they forged an alliance

40:35.760 --> 40:38.509
with Dan Blankenship's longtime rival

40:38.509 --> 40:40.869
Fred Nolan they've also made a

40:40.869 --> 40:43.089
potentially important discovery with

40:43.089 --> 40:46.630
them but now that virtually every acre

40:46.630 --> 40:48.790
of the island is available for them to

40:48.790 --> 40:52.609
explore what will they find more

40:52.609 --> 40:55.269
evidence of booby-trapped flood tunnels

40:55.269 --> 40:57.560
a man-made cavern in which lies a

40:57.560 --> 41:01.770
mysterious metal chest one thing is

41:01.770 --> 41:05.029
certain the baton of Oak Island history

41:05.029 --> 41:07.619
has been passed and Rick and Marty

41:07.619 --> 41:11.849
lagina have now inherited 220 years of

41:11.849 --> 41:16.729
history and myth triumph and tragedy but

41:16.729 --> 41:18.269
whether the search will end with

41:18.269 --> 41:22.289
discovery or will remain a mystery is

41:22.289 --> 41:25.319
something only time and the island can

41:25.319 --> 41:29.799
tell

41:29.799 --> 41:32.619
next time on the curse of Oak Island

41:32.619 --> 41:34.910
there's a structure in the swamp fred

41:34.910 --> 41:38.499

41:38.499 --> 41:41.239

41:41.239 --> 41:42.239

41:46.670 --> 41:49.200
boom convinced it's a wreck look at all

41:49.200 --> 41:51.210
the targets in your head and a line

41:51.210 --> 41:53.539
there's a triangle on top of the

41:53.539 --> 41:54.539
triangle what was the point it's

41:54.539 --> 41:56.650
actually pointing to the stone triangle

41:56.650 --> 41:57.899
on the island
