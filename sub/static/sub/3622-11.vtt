09:05.779 --> 09:07.112
I'll see you.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.513
Hmm.

09:16.489 --> 09:19.190
You know, Wonder Weasel,
I hate playing Kim,

09:19.192 --> 09:21.726
but they don't call it a secret
identity for nothing, right?

09:21.728 --> 09:23.295
Uh-huh.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.064
Listen up, two words:

09:26.066 --> 09:27.132
"always alert."

09:27.134 --> 09:28.366
I'm sorry, what was that?

09:28.368 --> 09:29.601
Ha, ha, psych.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.369
See, that's what I usually do
as a sidekick.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.571
You know, I do the funny stuff.

09:32.573 --> 09:33.572
Leave the gags to the weasel.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.839
Mm-hmm.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.741
The Fearless Ferret
is all business.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.109
You got it, sir.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.111
( <i>crashing</i> )

09:40.113 --> 09:40.812
You hear that, little chum?

09:40.814 --> 09:41.713
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

09:41.715 --> 09:42.714
Let's go.

09:46.218 --> 09:47.552
( <i>groans</i> )

09:47.554 --> 09:49.788
Eww! Now I smell it, too.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.756
Yow, it's rank.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.426
It can't be. It's...

09:54.428 --> 09:55.360
A giant skunk?!

09:55.362 --> 09:56.828
The Wicked White Stripe.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.096
As you well know,

09:58.098 --> 09:59.164
my ferrety foe.

10:00.299 --> 10:01.099
( <i>gasps</i> )

10:01.867 --> 10:03.602
White Stripe,

10:03.604 --> 10:04.603
that fiend.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.770
You know this guy?

10:05.772 --> 10:07.372
My noxious nemesis.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.441
Beware of his Stink Stream.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.609
I don't even want
to know what that is.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.844
Activate Fragrant
Ferret Deodorizer.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.679
Right.
( <i>beeping</i> )

10:14.681 --> 10:16.314
Um, which one is that?

10:16.316 --> 10:17.382
The nose!

10:20.419 --> 10:22.520
( <i>coughing</i> )

10:25.324 --> 10:26.124
( <i>yelps</i> )

10:26.126 --> 10:27.359
( <i>whistles</i>)

10:29.328 --> 10:32.163
Wade, are you sure Ron's pager
is in this building?

10:32.165 --> 10:33.632
Are you sure
it's any of your business?

10:33.634 --> 10:34.699
He's been acting funny.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.434
I just want
to make sure he's okay.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.902
Then yes, the trace is solid.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.839
Not so fast, Ferret.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.607
Come on down.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.276
( <i>yelping</i> )

10:49.248 --> 10:50.448
( <i>gasps and sniffs</i> )

10:50.450 --> 10:51.783
Eww. Ron?

10:51.785 --> 10:52.684
You in here?

10:52.686 --> 10:53.785
Kim?

10:53.787 --> 10:55.754
Use the Ferret Flicker.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.356
No, that's the Ferret Tail.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.592
We really should have gone over
this before I went skulking.

11:00.594 --> 11:01.726
Oh...

11:06.499 --> 11:07.699
Try up here.

11:09.235 --> 11:09.934
( <i>grunting</i> )

11:16.942 --> 11:17.909
Missy, this is none

11:17.911 --> 11:18.877
of your business.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.478
Making it my business, stinky.

11:24.383 --> 11:26.351
( <i>yelling</i> )

11:26.353 --> 11:28.386
We'll meet again, Ferret.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.789
( <i>laughs</i> )

11:30.791 --> 11:33.258
So, wh-who are you
supposed to be?

11:33.260 --> 11:34.726
Just think of me as...

11:34.728 --> 11:35.760
a friend.

11:35.762 --> 11:36.661
Yeah, no, duh.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.263
Ron.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.932
That is so not cool
to do to a super hero.

11:40.934 --> 11:41.933
Retreat, retreat.

11:41.935 --> 11:42.901
Preserve your secret identity.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.669
Uh, got to go.

11:46.806 --> 11:48.873
Nice cave you've got here.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.341
Kim!

11:50.343 --> 11:52.777
Um, it's a hole.
The Ferret Hole.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.479
And you're doing what exactly?

11:54.481 --> 11:57.348
If somebody told you I was just
an ordinary teenage sidekick,

11:57.350 --> 11:58.416
somebody lied.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.284
What?

11:59.286 --> 12:01.019
I am the Fearless Ferret,

12:01.021 --> 12:01.986
version 2.0.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.021
Ahem!

12:03.023 --> 12:04.022
And Wonder Weasel.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.557
Um, I think it's great

12:05.559 --> 12:07.692
you get to be
all ferrety, but...

12:07.694 --> 12:08.860
What have you done?

12:08.862 --> 12:10.261
You know better

12:10.263 --> 12:11.730
than to bring strangers
to the Ferret Hole.

12:11.732 --> 12:12.964
And without a mask.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.933
You've compromised
your secret identity.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.502
She followed me,
Mr. N.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.637
This is my friend,
Kim Possible.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.739
She's wily.

12:20.741 --> 12:21.973
Wily, eh?

12:21.975 --> 12:23.541
Sounds like the Ferret Girl.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.376
Quickly, don this costume.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.778
Uh, thanks. No.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.848
I don't get the whole superhero,
secret identity thing.

12:29.850 --> 12:30.982
What do you mean?

12:30.984 --> 12:32.550
You chase bad guys, too.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.919
Yeah, but my clothes
are off the rack.

12:34.921 --> 12:35.820
( <i>pager beeping</i>)

12:35.822 --> 12:36.988
Hey, Wade.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.456
Who else knows you're here?

12:38.458 --> 12:39.290
Who's that?

12:39.292 --> 12:40.525
Long story.
What's up?

12:40.527 --> 12:41.760
You got a hit on the site

12:41.762 --> 12:43.695
from the Lowerton Lemurs
football team.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.463
Someone stole
their dirty laundry.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.498
Weird.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.499
Ron, you coming?

12:47.501 --> 12:48.500
Indeed I am.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.401
I will ferret out
this crime as...

12:50.403 --> 12:51.870
the Fearless Ferret.

12:51.872 --> 12:55.540
Remember, the Fearless Ferret
never plays second fiddle.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.041
Sorry, old friend.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.811
Wonder Weasel and I will handle
this by ourselves, ferret style.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.980
Yeah, I'll try
to stay out of your way.

13:26.672 --> 13:27.739
( <i>high-pitched whistling</i> )

13:35.581 --> 13:36.614

ANNOUNCER:
Tomorrow, four freaky hippies

13:53.633 --> 13:55.466
become super spies in...

13:57.102 --> 13:59.437
More TV trash?

13:59.439 --> 14:00.638
The trashiest.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.141
ANNOUNCER:
Next up, the Fearless Ferret.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.911
That's right, Wonder Weasel.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.080
It's time to ferret out evil.

14:10.749 --> 14:14.686
The Fearless Ferret
is a TV character?

14:49.421 --> 14:51.089
ANNOUNCER:
Tonight's episode...

14:54.560 --> 14:55.894
I can't believe it.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.128
You should have seen

14:57.130 --> 14:59.063
the "where are they now"
special on the show.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.900
The actors that played
Ferret and White Stripe

15:01.902 --> 15:03.534
are complete space cases.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.104
They both totally thought
the whole thing was real.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.539
My best friend, space case.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.649
Okay, Ferret,
let's see you get out of this.

15:22.454 --> 15:24.088
Hick-a-bick-a-boo.

Fearless Ferret on TV Trash Heap?

15:26.760 --> 15:28.726
Then come on down to Ferret Fest

15:28.728 --> 15:30.528
at the Tri City
Convention Center.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.596
BOTH:
Hoo-sha

15:31.598 --> 15:32.597
Meet your fellow

15:32.599 --> 15:33.865
Ferret fanciers.

15:33.867 --> 15:36.034
Prizes to the best
Ferret costume.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.703
There's no better way
to ferret out fun!

15:38.705 --> 15:40.004
I've got to find Ron.

15:44.510 --> 15:45.843
Shrouded in shrubbery,

15:45.845 --> 15:48.046
the Fearless Ferret
prepares to pounce.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.148
Maybe punks pounce,
ferrets do not.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.784
Okay, how 'bout I...
face my foe?

15:52.786 --> 15:54.018
Better.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.219
Throw in something
about the skulking skunk.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.454
You sure he's coming?

15:56.456 --> 15:57.755
Definitely.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.791
Hitting the perfume factory
fits Stripe's M.O.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.059
It's just a matter of time.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.093
Hold the phone, partner.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.661
I've got an intruder.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.564
Nice moves, kid.

16:06.566 --> 16:07.999
You sure you don't want
to be Ferret Girl?

16:08.001 --> 16:10.068
So sure.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.903
Mr. North, we need to talk.

16:11.905 --> 16:13.237
Oh, dear me.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.774
Can somebody help
a poor old lady?

16:18.110 --> 16:20.545
FF One, FF Two here, copy?

16:20.547 --> 16:21.813
FF One?

16:21.815 --> 16:23.681
Hello, Mr. North?

16:23.683 --> 16:26.484
Ah, looks like we're on
our own, Wonder Weasel.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.485
Flying solo.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.186
Ahem!

16:28.188 --> 16:30.188
Uh, flying duo, sorry.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.689
( <i>crying</i> )

16:31.691 --> 16:33.858
What can the Fearless Ferret
do for you, ma'am?

16:34.960 --> 16:37.528
Smell my stink spray.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.766
Eww!

16:41.768 --> 16:42.667
( <i>gasping</i> )

16:42.669 --> 16:43.835
Whoa...

16:43.837 --> 16:45.269
A TV show?

16:45.271 --> 16:47.238
Yeah, that does ring a bell.
Sort of.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.540
Still, my fight against
evil, that was real.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.641
Not. Sorry.

16:50.643 --> 16:51.809
Now about Ron...

16:51.811 --> 16:53.611
Wait, what about my bum leg?

16:53.613 --> 16:55.680
I definitely got this
battling evil.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.781
Uh, no.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.750
You got it after
your show was canceled,

16:58.752 --> 17:00.985
when they had to forcibly
remove you from the set.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.254
Mr. North,
I'm afraid you've lived

17:03.256 --> 17:04.856
with all the show props
for so long

17:04.858 --> 17:06.157
that you began
to think it was real.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.759
Maybe.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.694
Or maybe you're a fiendish foe

17:09.696 --> 17:12.530
who wants me to believe
I was only an actor.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.033
Exhibit A. TV Trash Heap.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.868
ANNOUNCER:
Remember Ferret fans,

17:16.870 --> 17:18.569
Ferret Fest is here

17:18.571 --> 17:20.605

Convention Center.

17:20.607 --> 17:23.141
Let's go, Wonder Weasel.

17:24.176 --> 17:26.010
An actor?

17:26.012 --> 17:27.011
Sorry, Mr. North.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.780
Now about Ron.

17:28.782 --> 17:31.182
I think White Stripe
might also a be a bit confused.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.051
Don't worry about your friend.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.585
He's a... he's gone.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.121
Gone where?

17:37.123 --> 17:39.290
Clunk, where are you?

17:39.292 --> 17:40.925
( <i>groans</i> )

17:40.927 --> 17:42.126
We got skunked.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.295
Mm-hmm. Pu.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.331
We're at the Tri City
Convention Center.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.900
Wow.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.035
This is badical.

17:51.037 --> 17:51.936
I've already got fans.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.337
WHITE STRIPE:
Oh, yes.

17:53.339 --> 17:56.908
The foolish fans
fawn over my ferrety foe.

17:56.910 --> 17:57.942
Good one.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.310
Thank you.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.345
I hope you'll enjoy
the view of my victory.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.914
Huh?
Behold!

18:04.116 --> 18:06.017
So what?
You've got one balloon.

18:06.019 --> 18:07.718
I've got a whole convention.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.620
Behold again.

18:10.289 --> 18:12.123
Okay, yeah.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.157
Ah, come on.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.259
Just below the tail.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.629
You're going
to pop your own balloon?

18:18.631 --> 18:21.866
That is no ordinary
balloon, Ferret.

18:21.868 --> 18:25.937
For it is filled with
the foulest odor.

18:25.939 --> 18:29.207
A stink that will cling to its
victims for years to come.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.242

I've located Ron.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.082
He's at the Tri City
Convention Center.

18:43.922 --> 18:45.656
Just like the old days.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.091
Racing to the rescue.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.993
Only in the old days...

18:48.995 --> 18:50.728
I was an actor in a TV show

18:50.730 --> 18:52.930
that got canceled
after two seasons.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.799
Just reality checking.

18:59.771 --> 19:00.938
What is this?

19:00.940 --> 19:02.373
Ferret Fest.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.311
Ron!

19:13.719 --> 19:15.052
Back off, Farnsworth.

19:15.054 --> 19:17.288
That name. I know that name.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.023
You should, it's your name.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.858
Rudolph Farnsworth, actor.

19:20.860 --> 19:24.729
Had a one-time guest spot
on the Fearless Ferret TV show.

19:24.731 --> 19:25.963
RON:
TV show?

19:25.965 --> 19:27.198
Sorry, Ron.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.933
The Fearless Ferret isn't real.

19:28.935 --> 19:29.934
It's, well...

19:29.936 --> 19:31.102
TV trash.

19:31.104 --> 19:32.737
Well, what about the Ferret Hole

19:32.739 --> 19:34.272
and all the other ferret stuff?

19:34.274 --> 19:35.840
North spent all his money
duplicating the set.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.008
Ah, lies!

19:37.010 --> 19:39.043
Smell my stink spray.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.679
( <i>gasps</i> ) Man, that stinks.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.980
Kim!

19:42.982 --> 19:44.215
Farewell, Ferret.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.150
Whoo-hoo!

19:47.286 --> 19:48.786
Time to step up.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.720
Yeah!

19:49.722 --> 19:51.389
( <i>grunting</i> )

20:09.875 --> 20:10.908
( <i>beeping</i> )

20:12.110 --> 20:13.411
Hop aboard, Wonder Weasel.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.323
Ta-dah.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.225
Well done, Wonder Weasel.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.929
( <i>grunting</i>)

20:31.931 --> 20:34.465
( <i>beeping</i> )

20:35.968 --> 20:38.369
MAN: What kind of
costume is that?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.338
MAN 2: White Strip, one
the lesser villains,

20:40.340 --> 20:41.939
played by Rudolph Farnsworth.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.975
He appeared only in episode 14.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.376
Who you calling lesser?

20:48.947 --> 20:51.849
( <i>grunting</i> )

20:54.386 --> 20:56.120
( <i>beeping</i> )

21:00.025 --> 21:02.426
( <i>grunting</i> )

21:12.904 --> 21:15.306
( <i>beeping</i> )

21:27.319 --> 21:28.886
You okay, Ferret Girl?

21:28.888 --> 21:30.021
Yeah.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.922
Look! Timothy North!

21:31.924 --> 21:32.957
In the flesh!

21:32.959 --> 21:34.558
North has never been
to a convention.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.893
Ever!

21:35.895 --> 21:36.927
Mr. North,

21:36.929 --> 21:38.029
an autograph?

21:38.031 --> 21:40.798
Tim?
Timothy North?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.100
Farnsworth.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.104
So, what have you
been up to, lately?

21:47.106 --> 21:48.472
Oh, living each day
in delusion,

21:48.474 --> 21:50.241
thinking that fiction
is reality.

21:50.243 --> 21:51.942
That's me.
Me, too.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.144
( <i>fans shouting</i> )

21:53.146 --> 21:55.413
North is actually smiling.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.581
Guess he just needed
some Ron-shine in his life.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.317
I'm a hero.
It's what I do.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.419
Way to go, hero.

22:01.421 --> 22:04.322
WOMAN: TV Trash Heap is
pulling in huge numbers.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.923
I know.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.359
We scrapped the bottom
of the barrel.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.161
The people eat it up.

22:11.029 --> 22:14.198
I smell a promotion.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.600
Oh!

22:16.602 --> 22:17.868
Ugh!
