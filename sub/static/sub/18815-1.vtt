WEBVTT

00:56.130 --> 00:58.000
Hey, babe.
So happy to see you!

00:58.210 --> 01:01.200
Hi! I got your flowers.
That was so sweet of you.

01:01.370 --> 01:02.930
Of course.
Well, I know you're finishing

01:02.970 --> 01:04.400
your Global Health paper today

01:04.569 --> 01:06.140
and you've been working
really hard on it.

01:06.170 --> 01:10.160
Well, I'm almost done, so, maybe

01:10.330 --> 01:14.760
you want to come over
and Netflix and chill and...

01:15.210 --> 01:16.210
What?

01:16.370 --> 01:19.160
You mean you want to fuck?

01:19.330 --> 01:21.200
I did not say that!

01:21.370 --> 01:22.400
Oh, my God!
I know.

01:22.610 --> 01:24.090
No! I was being
more subtle than that!

01:24.170 --> 01:25.170
I know. I'm sorry.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.520
Yes, I am so down for that.

01:27.690 --> 01:29.400
It's been like
three fucking days.

01:29.570 --> 01:32.130
My balls are so blue right now,

01:32.330 --> 01:33.760
like dark blue,
Uh-oh.

01:33.850 --> 01:34.910
Like almost black.

01:35.090 --> 01:37.040
No, I'm fucking serious.
Here, check it out.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.550
I believe you.
I believe you.

01:39.730 --> 01:40.730
Okay.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.800
I'll see your
almost-black balls later.

01:42.890 --> 01:43.890
Cool, Steph.

01:44.010 --> 01:46.040
Come over any time after 6:00.
Okay, hun?

01:46.210 --> 01:48.080
Okay. Dude,
we are going to Netflix

01:48.170 --> 01:50.840
and chill this shit so hard.

01:51.010 --> 01:54.040
Peaky Blinders. Kimmy Schmidt!

01:54.210 --> 01:55.560
Movember's over.

01:55.930 --> 01:58.520
Time to shave the pornstache.

01:59.050 --> 02:01.480
Sorry. Making a Murderer!

02:01.690 --> 02:03.080
Narcos!

02:03.250 --> 02:06.000
Stranger Things!

02:06.170 --> 02:08.520
Black balls!

02:24.490 --> 02:26.520
Anyways, Ned followed his dreams

02:26.690 --> 02:28.480
and turned a run-down
old printing press

02:28.570 --> 02:29.920
into the industry powerhouse

02:30.090 --> 02:32.120
known today
as the Fleming Company.

02:32.490 --> 02:33.940
Best boss in the world!

02:33.970 --> 02:36.000
The Fleming Company!

02:36.170 --> 02:37.360
We're talking

02:37.530 --> 02:39.520
brochures for
Steelcase furniture,

02:39.730 --> 02:41.840
half the specialty jobs
in Grand Rapids

02:41.930 --> 02:45.520
and who could forget
the Domino's Pizza circular?

02:47.970 --> 02:49.800
But before all that...

02:49.970 --> 02:53.120
Ned met a young Michigan
Wolverine, Barbara Welsh.

02:53.330 --> 02:55.000
How did this older guy get me?

02:55.170 --> 02:58.680
Ned took her on their first date
to see his favorite band...

02:58.850 --> 03:01.960
Kiss!
Kiss!

03:02.210 --> 03:03.400
My favorite band, too!

03:03.570 --> 03:04.790
Rock and roll!

03:04.970 --> 03:06.320
A few years later,

03:06.490 --> 03:08.680
the stork brought
my sister, Stephanie.

03:08.770 --> 03:10.160
Aw!

03:10.250 --> 03:12.000
She's so cute.

03:13.010 --> 03:14.840
They weren't close at all.

03:15.010 --> 03:17.360
Oh, dropping her off at school.
Yeah.

03:17.450 --> 03:20.080
Then came me, Scotty F.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.310
Did we have another child?

03:21.450 --> 03:23.420
I forgot about that second baby.
Oh, we had another child.

03:23.450 --> 03:24.590
Anyways, Big Cheese.

03:26.810 --> 03:27.810
I'm sorry, guys.

03:27.890 --> 03:29.880
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna do this.

03:29.970 --> 03:31.320
Aw...

03:31.450 --> 03:33.040
But I love you, Dad.
Happy Birthday.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.160
Way to go, Scotty!

03:34.250 --> 03:35.760
I love you, too, buddy.

03:35.930 --> 03:37.170
Thank you. Wow!

03:37.770 --> 03:39.440
That was fantastic.

03:40.010 --> 03:41.410
We've got
one last surprise for you.

03:41.530 --> 03:42.890
That's right.
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:42.970 --> 03:44.720
live from her dorm room
at Stanford...

03:44.890 --> 03:46.720
it's my sister, Stephanie!

03:49.250 --> 03:50.640
Hi, everyone!
Hey, honey!

03:51.810 --> 03:53.560
Hey, Steph!
Hey, it's Kevin!

03:53.730 --> 03:55.320
Hi, Kevin!
Kevin.

03:55.490 --> 03:57.280
Can we see?
Sorry.

03:57.450 --> 03:59.160
Hi, Momma.
Hi!

03:59.330 --> 04:00.360
Hi, Dad.

04:00.530 --> 04:01.720
The birthday boy.

04:01.890 --> 04:02.920
Hey, honey.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.840
You guys look like
you're having so much fun.

04:05.010 --> 04:06.480
And I wish I could
be there with you.

04:06.690 --> 04:08.240
She's so sweet.

04:08.410 --> 04:09.720
Yeah.
Get out.

04:09.890 --> 04:12.000
Yeah, I just wanted to say,
Dad, that I love you.

04:12.170 --> 04:13.480
I love you, too, honey.

04:13.650 --> 04:14.870
I love you more.
No, you don't.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.209
Love you to the moon and back.

04:16.370 --> 04:18.040
I'll let you win this round.
Okay, Pops?

04:19.490 --> 04:21.279
Even though you're now like...

04:22.610 --> 04:23.640
...ancient.

04:23.810 --> 04:25.120
You are still...

04:25.370 --> 04:26.370
What are you doing here?

04:26.530 --> 04:27.960
You asked me to come over.

04:28.170 --> 04:29.660
You're early.
I said after 6:00.

04:29.690 --> 04:30.860
All right.
Give me a sec,

04:30.890 --> 04:31.980
- I'm on the phone.
- Got it.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.260
Sorry.
It's just my friend. Anyway.

04:33.290 --> 04:36.640
Happy birthday to you

04:36.850 --> 04:38.800
Oh, my goodness.

04:38.970 --> 04:40.080
Oh, Laird, what are you...

04:40.250 --> 04:41.300
Go finish your call.

04:41.330 --> 04:43.290
I'm just getting ready
to Netflix and chill, baby.

04:43.410 --> 04:44.810
No, not now, Laird.
Oh, my goodness.

04:44.890 --> 04:45.890
Kimmy Schmidt!

04:45.970 --> 04:47.140
Pull up your pants.
Marco Polo.

04:47.170 --> 04:48.880
Oh, my God!

04:50.050 --> 04:51.610
How do you make it stop?

04:51.730 --> 04:53.060
Whoa, whoa, Mom,
you just took a screenshot.

04:53.090 --> 04:55.440
Happy, happy birthday
Happy, happy birthday

04:55.610 --> 04:56.660
Kevin, help her out. Kevin.

04:56.690 --> 04:58.760
Happy birthday, happy birthday

05:09.810 --> 05:13.590
Mi oh my, it's a wonderful life

05:13.690 --> 05:18.480
It's a wonderful life
with you by my side

05:18.570 --> 05:22.160
Mi oh my, it's a wonderful life

05:22.250 --> 05:26.960
It's a wonderful life
with you by my side

05:27.090 --> 05:28.780
Hey, there he is.
Happy birthday, Big Cheese.

05:28.810 --> 05:29.810
Thanks, Jim.

05:31.170 --> 05:32.680
Jerry.
Hey, Ned.

05:32.770 --> 05:33.900
Fun dinner last night.
Hey, Jerry.

05:33.930 --> 05:34.930
Thanks. Lou.

05:35.050 --> 05:36.330
Hey, Cheese,
can I have a minute?

05:36.530 --> 05:38.200
Sure. Good morning, Joyce.

05:38.410 --> 05:39.800
Great party.

05:39.970 --> 05:41.600
Hold all his calls.

05:43.970 --> 05:45.480
You gotta be kidding me.

05:45.650 --> 05:47.400
Big Lots is bailing out on us?

05:47.570 --> 05:49.280
We've had that account
since '06.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.240
They're moving all their
print work to China.

05:51.410 --> 05:52.410
Oh, God.

05:52.570 --> 05:55.360
Cheese, we're already getting
pummeled by Evite, Stamp-Free

05:55.530 --> 05:56.920
and the rest of those
dot-coms.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.600
And at this rate,
we'll be Chapter 11 by March.

05:59.770 --> 06:01.050
What about
Dick's Sporting Goods?

06:01.210 --> 06:04.080
Well, I mean, I'm still
trading calls with my guy.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.200
But, Ned,
can I be honest with you?

06:06.370 --> 06:07.970
I can't keep this
from Patty much longer.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.840
Lou, haven't I kept us going?

06:11.490 --> 06:13.760
Yeah. I mean,
it's what you do.

06:13.930 --> 06:16.520
I just need a little
more time. That's all.

06:16.690 --> 06:18.680
You are the maestro.

06:18.850 --> 06:21.040
Maybe you'll pull off
a Christmas miracle.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.510
Yeah.
Yeah.

06:23.690 --> 06:25.880
By the way, good job keeping
that game face last night.

06:25.970 --> 06:26.970
Oh. Thanks.

06:27.050 --> 06:28.360
That was some shindig, man.

06:28.450 --> 06:29.450
Yeah, it was fun.

06:29.530 --> 06:31.120
Well, till the kid
had his farter

06:31.210 --> 06:32.640
all over the screen
in 3-D.

06:32.810 --> 06:33.950
I was like, "Whoa!

06:34.450 --> 06:35.450
"That's a lot, man."

06:35.610 --> 06:36.610
And get this...

06:36.770 --> 06:38.320
Stephanie now wants us
to fly out...

06:38.490 --> 06:41.120
to meet the man behind the
crack over the holidays.

06:41.290 --> 06:42.730
With everything
that's going on here,

06:42.850 --> 06:44.060
that's the last thing
I want to do.

06:44.090 --> 06:45.400
Well, hold on now.

06:45.490 --> 06:47.120
This is the first
serious boyfriend?

06:47.450 --> 06:49.360
Yeah. Apparently.

06:49.970 --> 06:52.600
I mean, it's so strange.

06:52.770 --> 06:56.000
I mean, Stephanie and I
have always been so close.

06:56.170 --> 06:58.880
And yet she has never even
mentioned this guy.

06:59.050 --> 07:00.320
That's the way it goes, Cheese.

07:00.530 --> 07:02.880
I thought I knew everything
about Lou Junior,

07:03.050 --> 07:04.250
when he was down at Ohio State.

07:04.610 --> 07:05.750
Out of nowhere,

07:05.850 --> 07:07.720
he comes dragging home
this Buckeye

07:07.890 --> 07:10.720
that he's been dating
for over a year.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.280
No.
Yeah.

07:12.450 --> 07:15.120
Nice girl, but still.
She's so controlling.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.280
I'm sorry.
I don't mean it like that

07:17.450 --> 07:18.840
because I don't know her
that well.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.240
But I don't like her.

07:20.410 --> 07:21.630
I don't.
Lou.

07:21.810 --> 07:23.320
It's just what happens,
you know?

07:23.490 --> 07:25.440
Lou, what is the point
of all this?

07:25.850 --> 07:27.160
Go out there and meet him.

07:27.330 --> 07:29.240
I know we going through
a lot right now

07:29.410 --> 07:32.800
but hell, Lou Junior is talking
about getting married in May.

07:32.890 --> 07:33.890
Married.

07:33.970 --> 07:36.040
Once they're not
under your roof,

07:36.170 --> 07:38.160
there's no telling
what they're into.

07:38.330 --> 07:39.760
Oh, uh, that reminds me.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.300
He does want you
to speak at the wedding

07:41.330 --> 07:43.630
and say some kind words.
Oh.

07:43.810 --> 07:46.160
I told him that I would
talk to you about it.

07:46.370 --> 07:48.930
And they'd like to get married
at your house in the backyard.

07:49.090 --> 07:51.000
Well...
But anyway...

07:51.210 --> 07:55.280
I'm just saying you might want to
get out there and meet this kid.

07:55.450 --> 07:56.670
Because, I mean, you saw it.

07:56.850 --> 07:59.120
You saw it, he's a free spirit.

07:59.850 --> 08:00.850
You mean...

08:01.050 --> 08:02.560
You heard him
come into the room.

08:02.730 --> 08:04.480
He came in there guns blazing.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.720
He had that revved up energy
where he was like...

08:07.930 --> 08:09.040
bow-bow-bow-bow.

08:09.210 --> 08:11.360
He just wants to go
and go and go...

08:11.530 --> 08:13.680
and just morning,
noon and night,

08:13.770 --> 08:15.160
and "Stephanie, here I am.

08:15.330 --> 08:17.890
"Stephanie, here I come.
I'm coming again."

08:18.050 --> 08:19.640
I remember being that age,
don't you?

08:19.810 --> 08:21.120
Just always ready.

08:29.410 --> 08:30.980
Come on, it's lovely weather

08:31.010 --> 08:33.200
For a sleigh ride
together with you

08:34.090 --> 08:35.280
Thanks for coming.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.679
Oh, gosh,
it is so gorgeous here.

08:40.850 --> 08:43.000
I'm very excited that you
guys are all out here.

08:43.169 --> 08:44.169
We're very excited.

08:44.330 --> 08:46.060
There's a few things that
I wanna tell you about Laird

08:46.090 --> 08:49.000
that I didn't feel like getting into
over the phone because...

08:49.090 --> 08:50.310
Watch, honey...

08:50.850 --> 08:51.910
You missed our exit.

08:52.170 --> 08:53.460
Actually,
I missed it on purpose.

08:53.490 --> 08:54.920
Laird and I thought,

08:55.570 --> 08:57.640
it'd be better if we all
stayed at his house.

08:57.730 --> 08:58.760
His house?

08:58.850 --> 09:00.690
When did this come up?
Did you know about this?

09:00.810 --> 09:04.040
Are you sure
his parents have enough room?

09:04.210 --> 09:05.580
I mean, he doesn't
live with his parents.

09:05.610 --> 09:07.990
Honey, we're not gonna be
comfortable at some crash pad.

09:08.170 --> 09:10.550
He lives by himself.
It's not a crash pad,

09:10.730 --> 09:12.280
but it's much nicer
than the Sheraton.

09:12.450 --> 09:13.880
Nicer than the club floor?

09:14.050 --> 09:15.360
I smooth-talked the manager.

09:15.450 --> 09:17.480
We got a suite
at the regular rate.

09:17.650 --> 09:19.600
What? That's what
I'm talking about, Big Cheese.

09:19.770 --> 09:21.400
That is impressive.
We have to turn back.

09:21.570 --> 09:23.160
Free continental breakfast.
Yes.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.700
Mint on the pillow,
turndown service,

09:24.730 --> 09:26.020
all things available
at the Sheraton.

09:26.050 --> 09:27.500
I mean, is your lover
going to have that?

09:27.530 --> 09:29.760
Your lover? Your lover?

09:29.970 --> 09:31.920
We already all know
that you've seen his penis.

09:32.010 --> 09:33.070
What?
Scott!

09:33.170 --> 09:34.170
What?

09:38.010 --> 09:41.440
Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening

09:41.690 --> 09:42.910
Well, this is cute.

09:43.090 --> 09:44.840
Actually, this is the gatehouse.

09:45.450 --> 09:46.560
Gatehouse?

09:46.770 --> 09:49.880
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight

09:49.970 --> 09:50.970
What the heck?

09:51.130 --> 09:53.280
Is that
a facial recognition scanner?

09:54.490 --> 09:55.520
Mmm-hmm.

09:55.610 --> 09:56.800
That's so cool.

09:57.090 --> 10:02.400
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird

10:02.490 --> 10:04.120
The hedge is moving.

10:04.330 --> 10:08.080
He sings a love song
As we go along

10:08.170 --> 10:10.680
Walking in a winter wonderland

10:10.770 --> 10:13.880
Honey, who exactly
are you dating?

10:14.050 --> 10:15.940
Laird started this company
called Guerrilla Gang.

10:15.970 --> 10:17.360
You play Ape Assassins, right?

10:17.530 --> 10:18.720
Are you kidding me?

10:18.810 --> 10:20.220
Yeah, that was my jam
in the eighth grade.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.250
Great, that's him.

10:21.410 --> 10:23.440
So, he makes video games?

10:23.650 --> 10:25.250
- Apps, Dad.
- This is it!

10:25.330 --> 10:26.760
This is his house?
Mmm-hmm.

10:27.170 --> 10:29.280
Are you sure this isn't
an Apple Store or something?

10:29.490 --> 10:30.730
Oh, my God.

10:30.810 --> 10:32.200
What is up, you gang?

10:32.410 --> 10:33.600
I know!

10:33.770 --> 10:35.720
The Flemings are here.
You have arrived!

10:35.890 --> 10:37.680
Hi, buddy. Hi.

10:38.130 --> 10:39.400
Hello, sweetheart.

10:40.210 --> 10:42.510
Don't touch anything.
How was traffic?

10:42.610 --> 10:43.660
It was okay.
Hi, they're here!

10:43.690 --> 10:44.690
Hello.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.120
Hello to you, Ned Fleming.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.730
Barbara.
Yes.

10:48.930 --> 10:51.080
You are perfect.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.240
Well, thank you.
Oh, my God.

10:53.410 --> 10:55.090
And this must be the main man.
Scotty, huh?

10:55.130 --> 10:57.120
Yup.
All right. Hey.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.000
- Who are you?
- Gustav.

10:59.170 --> 11:00.520
I am Gustav. Yes.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.040
I never know
how to describe you.

11:03.210 --> 11:06.280
Um, well, estate manager
is cool, Stephy, yes.

11:06.450 --> 11:07.480
That works.

11:07.650 --> 11:09.840
I used to run
the Four Seasons group in Asia

11:10.010 --> 11:11.440
but after some point, you know,

11:11.610 --> 11:13.300
the corporate life becomes
a bit of a snooze-fest.

11:13.330 --> 11:15.120
You know, "Tiffany's this,
Cartier that."

11:15.330 --> 11:17.680
But, you know. Just dot,
dot, dot. Enough already.

11:17.850 --> 11:19.440
You know what I'm
talking about, Ned.

11:19.610 --> 11:20.810
Oh, yeah. Sure.

11:20.930 --> 11:21.930
Boring.

11:22.130 --> 11:23.640
Where's Laird?
Laird is upstairs.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.560
He is just finishing
a teleconference.

11:25.690 --> 11:26.690
He'll be right out.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.240
Oh, okay.
Why don't we go up then?

11:28.330 --> 11:29.330
Laird, I'm Ned.

11:29.410 --> 11:30.410
No, no, no.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.540
No, this is Randy.
That's not Laird.

11:31.570 --> 11:32.570
He's our intern.

11:32.650 --> 11:36.000
Just graduated
summa cum laude at MIT.

11:36.170 --> 11:37.960
So Randy, shake a leg.
Get their luggages.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.270
Yes, sir.

11:39.450 --> 11:43.040
The motherfucking Flemings
are in the house!

11:43.130 --> 11:44.130
Yes!

11:44.930 --> 11:47.000
This is fucking awesome!

11:47.170 --> 11:49.080
Get up here.
I'm so psyched to meet you.

11:49.690 --> 11:52.250
Family, baby.
Fuck yeah!

11:53.490 --> 11:54.960
Oh, my God.

11:55.130 --> 11:56.480
Scotty.

11:56.650 --> 11:59.720
Yes, my brotha!
Welcome.

11:59.890 --> 12:01.110
Hey, Barb.
Hi.

12:02.690 --> 12:03.830
Oh.

12:04.930 --> 12:05.930
Welcome.

12:06.130 --> 12:08.040
Hey, Ned. All right.

12:08.130 --> 12:09.560
Oh, yes.

12:10.450 --> 12:12.000
Yes.
Yes.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.440
Yes.
So glad you're here.

12:13.610 --> 12:14.800
Yes.
Hey. Hi.

12:15.010 --> 12:16.040
Hey, baby.
Hi.

12:17.810 --> 12:18.870
I fucking missed you.

12:19.050 --> 12:21.160
Why aren't you wearing a shirt
on your body?

12:21.250 --> 12:22.250
Oh.

12:22.570 --> 12:24.490
Don't worry about that.
I have a little surprise.

12:24.570 --> 12:27.240
Let's stay half an hour and
then we go back to the hotel.

12:27.410 --> 12:29.000
That's a good plan.
Thank you.

12:29.090 --> 12:30.520
Dad, come on.
This place is so sick.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.440
Yeah, it's sick.
25 minutes.

12:32.530 --> 12:33.530
That's it.

12:37.730 --> 12:40.110
Hey! Just leave her alone.

12:40.330 --> 12:41.680
Hey, oh, Ned. Ned.

12:41.850 --> 12:44.280
Ned, would you look at that.

12:44.450 --> 12:45.800
That's your face, Sis.
Oh.

12:45.970 --> 12:47.160
Very good likeness.

12:47.290 --> 12:48.350
Oh, thanks. Yeah.

12:48.450 --> 12:51.160
The Stephy tattoo. I got it, like,
a week after we met, right?

12:51.330 --> 12:52.880
One week. You know,
right on my heart.

12:53.090 --> 12:55.280
Great. Okay, do you guys
want to go see the house?

12:55.450 --> 12:56.490
Uh...
We probably should...

12:56.650 --> 12:58.640
We came to stop and say hey.
Yeah. We should go.

12:58.850 --> 12:59.850
Actually, no.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.570
No. Before we go, um...

13:02.770 --> 13:04.360
I have a little surprise
for everybody.

13:04.530 --> 13:06.680
Shit.
I'm fucking nervous.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.060
Do you want to
consult me about it?

13:08.090 --> 13:09.220
You want to talk to me
before you...

13:09.250 --> 13:11.240
You know what? No, I'm just
jumpin' in. All right?

13:11.410 --> 13:12.450
I'm just going to do this.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.280
Laird, it's going to be
fucking great.

13:14.490 --> 13:16.040
Ta-da!

13:16.730 --> 13:17.790
Oh, my God.

13:18.570 --> 13:20.200
I just got it done this morning

13:20.370 --> 13:21.920
Yeah.
I bet it's red, huh?

13:22.090 --> 13:23.150
I need a little feedback.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.400
Is that our Christmas card?
Yes.

13:25.570 --> 13:28.240
Yeah! That's exactly what
I used. How'd you know?

13:28.410 --> 13:29.580
Look, he even got
Noodle in there.

13:29.610 --> 13:30.750
Hurt like balls.

13:30.930 --> 13:34.360
Gosh, it says "Happy Holidays"
and everything.

13:34.530 --> 13:35.590
What?

13:35.770 --> 13:37.640
Get the fuck out of here.
Okay.

13:37.810 --> 13:39.080
It says "Happy Holidays?"

13:39.250 --> 13:40.250
Barb, fuck you.

13:40.410 --> 13:41.600
God damn.

13:41.810 --> 13:43.480
I gave the guy
the Christmas card.

13:43.570 --> 13:45.100
I didn't know he put
"Happy Holidays" on there.

13:45.130 --> 13:46.480
Wow.
Fuck.

13:46.690 --> 13:48.440
Guess it's stuck on there, huh?

13:48.650 --> 13:49.870
Oops.
Fuck.

13:50.050 --> 13:51.960
Well, you know,
you guys were coming over...

13:52.130 --> 13:54.880
I was so excited, I just had
to do something, you know?

13:55.050 --> 13:57.640
Well, that is something,
all right.

13:57.810 --> 14:00.520
You know what? Sometimes, you
just got to say, "Fuck it."

14:00.650 --> 14:01.650
Fuck it!

14:01.730 --> 14:02.790
You should...
Laird,

14:02.970 --> 14:04.880
this is a 15-year-old child.

14:05.050 --> 14:06.480
So, we don't really...

14:06.650 --> 14:08.200
Oh, shit.

14:08.370 --> 14:10.560
- You don't say fuck?
- No, Mom, I...

14:10.730 --> 14:11.730
Heck yeah, I cuss.

14:11.890 --> 14:12.920
No, you don't.

14:13.130 --> 14:14.130
You do?
Yeah.

14:14.210 --> 14:15.640
Oh, he cusses.
No, you don't.

14:15.770 --> 14:17.060
Yeah, bro, what's your
favorite cuss word?

14:17.090 --> 14:18.090
Oh, boy.

14:18.170 --> 14:19.250
Don't egg him on like that.

14:19.330 --> 14:20.360
What's your favorite?

14:21.130 --> 14:23.040
- Uh...
- Hmm.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.310
Titties.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.800
Titties? Titties.

14:26.970 --> 14:28.210
Stop it. Stop that.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.680
Titties? Classic.

14:29.850 --> 14:31.840
Okay. We should be going.

14:32.010 --> 14:33.520
Nice one. What else you got?
Asshole.

14:33.690 --> 14:35.180
Asshole.
All right. That's enough.

14:35.210 --> 14:36.340
Okay. Another good body part.

14:36.370 --> 14:37.800
What else?
Dicking. Double dicking.

14:37.970 --> 14:39.440
Double dicking.
Okay.

14:39.610 --> 14:40.800
Wait. Hold on.
Double dicking?

14:40.970 --> 14:42.620
Are you happy?
That's a new one on me, bro.

14:42.650 --> 14:43.650
What the fuck is that?

14:43.770 --> 14:46.000
What the hell is that?
Is that like dick to dick?

14:46.170 --> 14:49.440
Okay! Good night!
We're going to the hotel.

14:49.610 --> 14:52.720
This kid is nasty
and I fucking like it.

14:52.890 --> 14:54.200
Yeah.
Yes!

14:54.370 --> 14:55.800
All right, let's do the tour.

14:56.010 --> 14:57.180
I'll show you around!
All right?

14:57.210 --> 14:58.430
Just throw your shit anywhere.

14:58.610 --> 14:59.930
You little double-dicker,
come on.

14:59.970 --> 15:01.010
Throw your stuff anywhere.

15:01.090 --> 15:02.280
By the way, I'm a huge fan.

15:02.370 --> 15:03.680
I'm part of the online Ape Army.

15:03.810 --> 15:04.810
Awesome.

15:04.890 --> 15:07.410
You know, this is what I was trying
to tell you guys in the car.

15:07.530 --> 15:09.080
This is okay here?

15:09.690 --> 15:11.320
Do you want to
take your coat off?

15:11.490 --> 15:13.080
Uh, no.
Nope. I'm fine.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.560
Come on, guys.

15:15.530 --> 15:16.700
All right,
so this here's the kitch.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.240
This is where we keep the food.

15:18.410 --> 15:19.440
The dining room.

15:19.610 --> 15:22.240
That's a sculpture
of a couple people fucking.

15:22.690 --> 15:24.680
Painting of a fat squirrel.

15:24.770 --> 15:26.520
And this one's called
"Triple Team,"

15:26.650 --> 15:27.960
self-explanatory.

15:28.850 --> 15:30.400
All right. This is the den.

15:30.570 --> 15:33.400
These dudes are just
testing out video games.

15:34.370 --> 15:37.360
Ned, Stephy says that you're
pretty serious about your bowling,

15:38.410 --> 15:40.320
so I had
a couple lanes installed.

15:41.130 --> 15:42.160
Oh, my God.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.340
None of this was here?

15:43.370 --> 15:44.370
No.

15:44.450 --> 15:47.480
You said you were fixing
a crack in the foundation.

15:47.650 --> 15:49.240
Is that us?

15:49.610 --> 15:51.840
Yeah, I got the images off
your league's Facebook page.

15:52.010 --> 15:53.150
That's so insane.

15:53.330 --> 15:55.790
Dad, look, he even got in
your signature "crotch chop."

15:56.570 --> 15:57.790
Oh, yeah.

15:58.010 --> 15:59.010
Wow.

15:59.170 --> 16:01.300
All right, this here is
where we develop a few apps

16:01.330 --> 16:03.200
for the Apple and
Android platforms.

16:03.410 --> 16:05.120
Hey, gang,
say hi to the Flemings.

16:05.330 --> 16:06.390
Hey, guys.
Hey, what's up?

16:06.570 --> 16:09.360
Wait, I don't understand.
Do your employees live here?

16:09.530 --> 16:12.320
Uh, maybe some of them do.
I don't really know.

16:13.290 --> 16:15.520
Gustav is actually
an amazing architect.

16:15.690 --> 16:17.240
We designed this place together.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.360
When did you go to Machu Picchu?

16:19.530 --> 16:21.440
Hun, when did you put these up?

16:21.610 --> 16:23.320
What the heck is that moose?

16:23.490 --> 16:24.630
That's a Phillip Manfredi.

16:24.810 --> 16:26.030
Great pick-up, Barb.

16:26.210 --> 16:29.240
Stephy told me that you're this amazing
art and photography professor.

16:29.410 --> 16:31.000
- That's awesome.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:31.170 --> 16:34.400
I teach a couple of classes
at a local community college.

16:34.570 --> 16:36.040
Don't be so modest, Mom.

16:36.130 --> 16:38.080
You're an amazing photographer.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.240
Oh, that looks like
a real dead moose.

16:41.170 --> 16:43.760
Well, that's exactly
what it is, Ned.

16:43.930 --> 16:46.640
A dead moose
suspended in its own urine.

16:46.810 --> 16:48.440
It's meant to symbolize the way

16:48.530 --> 16:50.800
that our culture
has imprisoned our minds.

16:52.050 --> 16:53.050
Oh.

16:53.530 --> 16:54.560
I got to tell you, Ned,

16:54.650 --> 16:56.950
great art really
gets me aroused.

16:57.130 --> 16:59.690
It's actually
a very strong aphrodisiac.

16:59.770 --> 17:00.800
Laird.

17:00.890 --> 17:03.500
Not that you need any help getting
turned on by that gorgeous woman.

17:03.530 --> 17:04.589
Honey.

17:04.770 --> 17:06.400
What? Your mom
is beautiful.

17:06.530 --> 17:08.440
She is. She deserves
some props for that.

17:08.609 --> 17:11.599
Well, I'll take a compliment
wherever I can get one.

17:11.810 --> 17:14.040
Well, here's another one.
You got a bangin' bod, too.

17:14.130 --> 17:15.160
All right.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.520
Hey, what's going on, everyone?

17:16.730 --> 17:18.280
Richard Blais, everybody.

17:18.450 --> 17:21.960
This is the maestro
of molecular gastronomy.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.640
Oh, my God.

17:23.730 --> 17:25.960
That's that cute one
from Top Chef.

17:26.130 --> 17:27.760
Oh, he's the one
who goes, "Bam!"

17:27.930 --> 17:31.200
No, that's Emeril.
He's a fucking dick, that guy.

17:31.410 --> 17:32.630
Dickie Blais what's up?

17:32.810 --> 17:36.400
Yeah, so Laird thought it would be a
fun idea to do a pop-up restaurant

17:36.570 --> 17:37.650
just in your honor tonight.

17:37.770 --> 17:39.280
Did he?
Yeah.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.160
And I have here
a little amuse-bouche.

17:41.330 --> 17:43.260
So if anyone's looking for
a little pre-dinner snack,

17:43.290 --> 17:44.350
you can head on up here.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.200
Count me in,
'cause I'm famished.

17:46.290 --> 17:47.290
All right.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.490
There are so many surprises.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.610
I know.

17:50.690 --> 17:51.980
You're hungry, you've come
to the right place.

17:52.010 --> 17:53.480
I've got surf and turf for you.

17:53.650 --> 17:54.760
Steak and lobster.

17:54.930 --> 17:56.040
Yum, yum.

17:57.010 --> 18:01.080
My version of surf and turf,
edible soil and plankton foam.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.720
Dig in.
Oh.

18:02.850 --> 18:05.150
Wow, can't wait for dinner.

18:05.330 --> 18:06.330
No.

18:07.090 --> 18:09.650
Hey, so I think
it's going great, right?

18:09.810 --> 18:11.680
I think they've already
accepted me.

18:11.850 --> 18:14.280
I'm getting a little bit
of a different vibe.

18:14.450 --> 18:15.880
Oh, really?
Like what?

18:16.050 --> 18:17.360
Don't try so hard.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.800
I'm not, what do you mean?

18:18.970 --> 18:20.880
You put in a bowling alley
for my dad

18:21.090 --> 18:23.920
and you got a tattoo of my
entire family on your back.

18:24.330 --> 18:25.360
Oh.

18:25.490 --> 18:26.490
Was the tattoo too much?

18:26.570 --> 18:27.680
Yes.
Fuck.

18:28.530 --> 18:30.400
Shit, I knew it.

18:30.570 --> 18:32.040
Yeah, Gustav said
the same thing.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.270
Okay, don't worry...

18:33.450 --> 18:36.360
I won't get any more tattoos
of them while they're here.

18:36.530 --> 18:37.590
Thank you.
Okay.

18:37.810 --> 18:38.840
I love you.

18:39.490 --> 18:41.240
I love you, too.

18:44.330 --> 18:45.330
Okay.

18:46.490 --> 18:48.420
Oh, one more thing, stop
calling them motherfuckers

18:48.450 --> 18:50.080
and talking about
how hot my mom is.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.960
Well, she's sneaky sexy,
took me by surprise.

18:53.130 --> 18:57.040
Dude, she is a MILF,
like a genuine MILF.

18:57.250 --> 19:00.360
And if it wasn't your MILF,
she'd be a MIWF...

19:00.530 --> 19:02.040
a mother I would fuck.

19:02.210 --> 19:03.240
Mmm-mmm.

19:03.330 --> 19:04.960
But I won't.
Okay.

19:06.010 --> 19:07.840
Of course.
Thank you.

19:13.050 --> 19:14.600
All right, it's pretty.
Yeah.

19:14.810 --> 19:15.810
You know...

19:18.610 --> 19:19.610
It's a lot.

19:19.810 --> 19:22.440
Yes! I mean, the moose...
Yes.

19:22.650 --> 19:24.280
And the language.
Come on!

19:24.370 --> 19:26.000
Mmm-hmm.
A real moose!

19:26.130 --> 19:28.200
And he's coming onto your mother.
That's not okay.

19:28.290 --> 19:29.560
And the tattoo?

19:30.050 --> 19:31.920
The tattoo! And how...

19:32.090 --> 19:33.720
32
Oh, my. And you're...

19:33.890 --> 19:35.030
22.
Yes!

19:35.210 --> 19:37.280
You didn't like the mural
of you and Scotty

19:37.370 --> 19:38.570
down in the new bowling alley?

19:38.610 --> 19:40.720
The bowling alley
with the mural is...

19:40.850 --> 19:42.400
And the bowling alley
is regulation.

19:42.570 --> 19:44.080
That's quite nice

19:44.250 --> 19:47.160
and that's very rare
to have something that nice.

19:47.330 --> 19:48.660
And the polish
that he used was quite...

19:48.690 --> 19:49.690
It was good. But...

19:49.850 --> 19:50.910
I'm sorry.

19:54.450 --> 19:55.450
I should have told you.

19:57.170 --> 19:58.920
About everything, of course.

19:59.490 --> 20:02.520
Honestly, I didn't know how to
explain him over the phone.

20:02.730 --> 20:04.400
I just kept imagining...

20:04.610 --> 20:06.120
Mom Googling Laird Mayhew

20:06.290 --> 20:08.590
and you guys
jumping to conclusions

20:08.690 --> 20:10.990
before you even got
a chance to know him.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.560
Well, now we know him.

20:14.410 --> 20:15.680
No, you don't.

20:15.770 --> 20:17.400
You've been here for 15 minutes.

20:18.530 --> 20:19.530
Yeah.

20:19.970 --> 20:21.520
Thank you.

20:23.370 --> 20:24.860
I wouldn't have asked you
to come out here

20:24.890 --> 20:26.090
and miss Christmas in Michigan

20:26.250 --> 20:29.520
for the first time ever,
if he wasn't...

20:29.690 --> 20:31.000
...really important to me.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.630
Hmm.

20:40.290 --> 20:41.290
Okay.

20:43.050 --> 20:45.120
You'll give him a chance?

20:45.290 --> 20:47.640
Okay. Okay, thank you.
Thank you.

20:48.090 --> 20:49.840
Come here.

20:54.450 --> 20:55.450
I love you.

20:55.610 --> 20:57.000
I love you, too.

21:00.570 --> 21:03.360
So if I did Google him,
what would I find?

21:03.450 --> 21:04.450
Don't do it.

21:04.570 --> 21:05.570
Oh.

21:05.650 --> 21:06.680
Just don't Google him.

21:06.850 --> 21:07.850
Oh.

21:09.490 --> 21:11.280
Well, I still don't see it.

21:12.170 --> 21:15.320
Darling, this is the male,
and he's thrusting.

21:15.490 --> 21:16.490
Oh, God.

21:16.530 --> 21:19.280
All right, everybody,
dinner is served!

21:19.450 --> 21:21.480
Scotty! Come on,
grab a stump.

21:21.650 --> 21:23.840
Dad, you wanna
go there? Mom.

21:24.010 --> 21:25.620
You sure you don't want
to take off your coat?

21:25.650 --> 21:26.650
No. I'm good.

21:26.810 --> 21:28.960
We do it family style here,
so everyone just dig in.

21:29.130 --> 21:30.440
It's super cas.

21:30.650 --> 21:32.840
Okay, so we have three dishes
for this evening.

21:33.010 --> 21:34.960
We have sous-vide geoduck.

21:35.130 --> 21:36.920
We have Mission-style
sea urchin burritos...

21:37.010 --> 21:38.010
Yum.

21:38.170 --> 21:39.360
...with edible paper.

21:39.810 --> 21:41.360
Because you're a printer.

21:41.530 --> 21:43.000
And last but not least...
Sweet.

21:43.170 --> 21:45.800
...we have smoked
California bear.

21:45.970 --> 21:46.970
Enjoy.

21:47.010 --> 21:48.360
Oh, shit!

21:48.530 --> 21:49.670
Thanks, Blais.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.160
- Bear?
- Mmm.

21:51.330 --> 21:52.610
Yo, Scotty,
you see The Revenant?

21:52.690 --> 21:53.960
No, I wanted to,

21:54.050 --> 21:56.180
but my parents don't really
let me watch R-rated movies.

21:56.210 --> 21:57.850
You're darn right we don't.
He's only 15.

21:57.930 --> 22:00.200
You want some paper?
Yes, certainly. Thank you.

22:00.370 --> 22:01.840
I don't know
what section that is.

22:02.010 --> 22:04.120
Because that bear
fucked that dude up!

22:04.210 --> 22:05.560
Now we're gonna
fuck this bear up.

22:05.770 --> 22:07.200
Hey, what about that language?

22:07.370 --> 22:08.370
Oh, shit. Sorry.

22:08.890 --> 22:11.000
Ah, I think I've got
the arts section here.

22:12.570 --> 22:14.240
You better slow down, Barb.

22:14.410 --> 22:16.410
You're gonna be full
before you get to the funnies.

22:18.410 --> 22:19.440
Ned.

22:24.610 --> 22:28.040
So, um, how did you two meet?

22:28.410 --> 22:30.710
Uh, you want me to go?
Yeah.

22:30.850 --> 22:31.850
Okay.

22:31.890 --> 22:34.160
Laird sponsored a talk on campus

22:34.250 --> 22:35.560
with Doctor Joanne Liu,

22:35.730 --> 22:37.130
the head of
Doctors Without Borders.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.250
Oh!

22:38.290 --> 22:40.320
Melinda Gates
got me totally pumped

22:40.410 --> 22:41.850
about issues
in the developing world.

22:41.930 --> 22:42.930
Now I'm obsessed.

22:43.250 --> 22:44.280
Wow.

22:45.090 --> 22:46.760
- That's Bill Gates' wife.
- Yeah.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.240
- She's great.
- Yeah.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.720
That's terrific.

22:49.890 --> 22:52.450
That's Steph's field of interest, too,
so that's great.

22:52.650 --> 22:53.710
Yeah, I know.

22:53.810 --> 22:55.370
Ned, you should've
seen her at the talk.

22:55.450 --> 22:58.720
She asked the most intelligent
question. I was blown away.

22:59.610 --> 23:00.920
Really? What did I say?

23:01.090 --> 23:02.200
You were like...

23:02.410 --> 23:03.580
"Hey, what's
the connection between

23:03.610 --> 23:05.880
"women's health
and population density

23:06.090 --> 23:07.560
"in indigenous communities?"

23:07.730 --> 23:09.960
I was like,
"Bam! Who's that?"

23:10.170 --> 23:11.760
That's so sweet of you
to remember that.

23:11.930 --> 23:13.760
Of course I remember. Mmm...

23:13.930 --> 23:15.810
- The first time I saw you.
- That's our girl.

23:15.890 --> 23:17.740
She's always been the smartest
person in the room.

23:17.770 --> 23:18.770
So true.
Yeah.

23:18.890 --> 23:20.960
And the sexiest. My God.
Well.

23:21.130 --> 23:23.160
I couldn't keep my eyes off her.

23:23.330 --> 23:24.640
Her hair, and her eyes.

23:24.730 --> 23:25.760
Very pretty eyes.

23:25.930 --> 23:27.480
The way her spine gently arches

23:27.570 --> 23:29.120
to meet the top of her tailbone.

23:29.290 --> 23:31.780
I just wanna pitch a tent and live in there.
You know what I mean?

23:31.810 --> 23:32.930
No.
You're taking it too far.

23:33.450 --> 23:35.080
Quite the outdoorsman.

23:35.250 --> 23:36.840
I just mean
she's got a great body.

23:37.010 --> 23:38.520
Oh, well, yes.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

23:38.690 --> 23:39.960
She's a darling girl.

23:40.130 --> 23:41.260
- Like you, Barb.
- Great genes.

23:41.290 --> 23:42.290
Okay.

23:42.330 --> 23:43.520
Two fit women.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.320
I'll have to
agree with you there.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.280
Ol' Slamming Bod Barb.

23:48.610 --> 23:50.680
Two fit women
and two lucky dudes...

23:51.330 --> 23:52.470
And one double-dicker.

23:54.970 --> 23:56.800
Okay, well.

23:58.210 --> 24:01.160
Laird, when did you graduate
from Stanford?

24:01.490 --> 24:03.160
Oh, I didn't go
to Stanford, bro.

24:03.290 --> 24:04.890
I hardly even graduated
from high school.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.830
He's being modest.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.140
He actually started writing code

24:08.170 --> 24:10.520
for Sun Microsystems
when he was 13.

24:10.730 --> 24:12.280
That's true.
Wow, that's just like me.

24:12.450 --> 24:14.090
I've been interning
at the Fleming Company

24:14.170 --> 24:15.480
since, what, the seventh grade?

24:15.690 --> 24:16.830
Mm-hmm. Yup.

24:17.010 --> 24:18.960
Future CEO,
but you are going to college.

24:19.650 --> 24:21.620
I know, Dad. I know. I know.
Just like your sister.

24:21.650 --> 24:23.640
So, Steph,
weren't your surprised

24:23.810 --> 24:26.640
that this big tech mogul
wanted to date you?

24:28.530 --> 24:31.120
He said he was some
low-level programmer at Uber.

24:31.330 --> 24:33.630
I had no idea that
he sponsored the entire event.

24:33.810 --> 24:34.840
So he lied to you.

24:35.010 --> 24:36.320
Oh, Ned, I had to.

24:36.490 --> 24:38.840
I mean there are so many gold
diggers in Silicon Valley.

24:39.050 --> 24:41.350
They just wanna fuck you
for your tech money.

24:41.530 --> 24:43.200
Language, baby.
You gotta be careful.

24:43.370 --> 24:45.360
I didn't spill the beans
till April.

24:45.530 --> 24:48.480
April? That's
eight months ago. What?

24:48.650 --> 24:50.000
Steph, over the phone, you said

24:50.090 --> 24:51.820
you've only known each other
for a couple of months.

24:51.850 --> 24:53.880
It was super casual at first.
No.

24:54.050 --> 24:55.080
No, it was not.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.400
We exchanged I love you's
on the third date.

24:57.570 --> 24:58.980
Remember? Right after we...
The third date?

24:59.010 --> 25:00.180
made love in the hot tub
at Esalen in Big Sur?

25:00.210 --> 25:01.210
No, no, no.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.200
Where, what?
Esalen in Big Sur.

25:03.370 --> 25:04.400
Really?

25:04.530 --> 25:06.560
Ned. Don't get
the wrong idea.

25:06.730 --> 25:09.560
It was not sexual at all.
It was so much more than that.

25:09.730 --> 25:10.890
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm confused.

25:11.050 --> 25:12.360
Did you have intercourse or not?

25:12.530 --> 25:13.750
Scotty, shut it.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.340
Dad, I'm just trying to
connect the dots here.

25:15.370 --> 25:16.760
Look. Yeah, we did.

25:16.930 --> 25:20.520
But what I'm saying is
I was transformed.

25:20.690 --> 25:23.720
Stephy opened up like a flower.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.280
You should have seen it.

25:25.450 --> 25:28.400
I shouldn't have seen it,
but now I feel like I have.

25:28.570 --> 25:29.960
I just want your parents to know

25:30.130 --> 25:31.330
that you're living with someone

25:31.370 --> 25:33.120
who's completely devoted to you.

25:33.970 --> 25:35.560
Wait a minute.
What-ing with someone?

25:35.730 --> 25:37.760
You say you're living together?
Yeah.

25:37.890 --> 25:40.400
No. We do not.

25:40.610 --> 25:42.600
Okay, five nights out of seven.

25:43.730 --> 25:45.480
Your stuff is here.

25:45.650 --> 25:46.970
You don't really
stay at the dorm.

25:48.410 --> 25:49.570
Do you have a toothbrush here?

25:49.730 --> 25:50.730
Yeah.
That's cohabitating.

25:50.890 --> 25:52.760
Scotty, stop talking
and eat your paper.

25:52.930 --> 25:54.640
Dad, we do not live together.

25:54.810 --> 25:56.280
Yeah, we're cohabitating.

26:01.490 --> 26:03.600
"Opened up like a flower."

26:03.770 --> 26:06.600
Honey, I'm looking at
the Esalen website right now

26:06.770 --> 26:08.280
and there's nothing
dirty about it.

26:08.450 --> 26:11.120
You go up there for yoga
classes and things like that.

26:11.290 --> 26:13.960
They've been practically
living together for a year.

26:14.130 --> 26:15.600
Why didn't she
just tell us that?

26:16.290 --> 26:18.160
Where the heck are the towels?

26:19.010 --> 26:20.840
He's even affected Scotty.

26:22.930 --> 26:25.960
What is a double dicking,
for crying out loud?

26:27.490 --> 26:28.520
Oh.
Uh...

26:28.650 --> 26:29.650
There she is.

26:29.810 --> 26:31.240
Oh, my God.
Oh, yeah. She's gonna...

26:31.450 --> 26:33.410
She better explain what
the heck is going on here.

26:33.490 --> 26:34.490
All right, so be nice.

26:34.650 --> 26:36.940
Be like, "Oh, my God.
I love your boyfriend. He's so normal."

26:36.970 --> 26:38.160
I'm good.

26:39.170 --> 26:40.280
Hi.

26:41.330 --> 26:42.360
Hi, uh...

26:44.690 --> 26:46.280
I thought you'd be Stephanie.

26:46.450 --> 26:47.480
Steph's super pooped.

26:47.650 --> 26:50.640
We had a big fight because of
the way I behaved at dinner.

26:50.810 --> 26:53.050
Don't worry, we took a shower
together and worked it out.

26:53.690 --> 26:55.990
But I snuck out
to have a little check in.

26:56.170 --> 26:57.170
Okay. Well...

27:05.690 --> 27:07.960
Ned, would you come join us?

27:08.850 --> 27:10.320
I'm good here.

27:10.530 --> 27:12.830
Oh, please.
This is an Alaskan king.

27:13.010 --> 27:14.520
There's so much room.

27:16.050 --> 27:17.480
So much room.

27:18.210 --> 27:20.200
It'd really mean
a lot to me. Please?

27:21.850 --> 27:22.990
Okay.

27:23.730 --> 27:24.730
Hey.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.030
I owe you two an apology.

27:34.210 --> 27:35.210
When I get nervous

27:35.370 --> 27:38.000
all kinds of crap comes
flying out of my mouth

27:38.170 --> 27:40.000
and I know that's not
how you guys roll.

27:40.090 --> 27:41.090
No.

27:41.210 --> 27:43.040
I was just trying
to make a good impression.

27:43.210 --> 27:44.880
Yeah. Well, you did.
It was...

27:45.050 --> 27:47.080
I mean you didn't,
but it's okay.

27:47.250 --> 27:50.320
It was an awkward dinner.

27:50.530 --> 27:52.240
It was a unique situation for...

27:52.450 --> 27:54.040
Yeah, but let's all
just move on.

27:54.730 --> 27:56.440
Okay. Great.

27:56.610 --> 27:57.610
Truth be told,

27:57.770 --> 28:01.000
I haven't spent a lot of time
with parental figures.

28:01.210 --> 28:04.280
I don't know if you know this,
but I never knew my father.

28:04.890 --> 28:07.520
Yeah, he picked up my mom
in this bar in Oakland.

28:07.690 --> 28:10.800
They had some sloppy car sex,
and then never spoke again.

28:10.890 --> 28:11.920
Yeah.

28:12.050 --> 28:14.200
I'm not really close
with my mom, either.

28:15.090 --> 28:18.560
To be frank, she's kind of
a motherfucking bitch.

28:20.450 --> 28:22.560
If I had a nickel
for every time I...

28:23.290 --> 28:24.350
Yeah.

28:24.530 --> 28:26.720
We're sorry to hear that.

28:26.890 --> 28:28.600
That's some tough stuff, pal.

28:28.770 --> 28:30.040
Yup. That's...

28:30.610 --> 28:31.610
That's...

28:31.770 --> 28:33.960
All right. Well,
it's getting late, so...

28:34.090 --> 28:35.090
Yeah.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.920
I'm in love
with your daughter, dudes.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.360
And I'm just so fucking psyched

28:38.450 --> 28:40.280
to get to know
the people that raised her.

28:40.450 --> 28:41.480
Mmm-hmm.

28:42.570 --> 28:45.320
And we're gonna do Christmas
just like you do at home.

28:45.490 --> 28:46.520
Tomorrow night,

28:46.610 --> 28:48.910
I'm gonna throw a party
in your honor.

28:49.770 --> 28:50.980
Oh, you don't have to
go to the trouble.

28:51.010 --> 28:52.070
You don't... It's not.

28:52.170 --> 28:54.730
We're gonna do
all the holiday shit.

28:55.450 --> 28:57.400
Okay. Hmm.
All the shit.

28:57.730 --> 28:59.960
Ned, I'd love some
guy time with you.

29:00.130 --> 29:02.280
So maybe we could take a walk
tomorrow morning?

29:03.290 --> 29:04.760
Okay.
Okay, cool.

29:04.930 --> 29:07.080
Justine, will you set Ned
an alarm for 6:30 a.m.?

29:07.170 --> 29:08.250
You got it, Laird.

29:08.290 --> 29:12.160
Ned, an alarm's been set for
you for 6:30 en la maÃ±ana.

29:12.330 --> 29:13.880
What? Who is that?

29:15.490 --> 29:17.000
That's Justine.

29:17.170 --> 29:20.160
Yeah, she's like Siri,
but awesome.

29:20.370 --> 29:22.160
I got that chick from
The Big Bang Theory,

29:22.330 --> 29:23.640
Kaley Cuoco, to do the voice.

29:23.810 --> 29:24.810
J, say hi.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.160
Hey, Ned. Hey, Barb.
How are you guys?

29:29.010 --> 29:30.040
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

29:30.170 --> 29:31.760
Stephanie's told me
so much about you.

29:31.850 --> 29:33.320
Anything you need, I'm here.

29:33.490 --> 29:34.630
- Okay.
- Thank you.

29:34.810 --> 29:36.960
She can't...
Can she see us?

29:37.690 --> 29:41.280
She says that she can't,
but I think that she can.

29:41.450 --> 29:43.210
What the fuck
are you talking about?

29:43.330 --> 29:44.470
You know I can't see them.

29:45.970 --> 29:47.030
She's a perv.

29:47.210 --> 29:48.210
Laird.

29:48.330 --> 29:51.320
Anyway, I hope you two have
a nice night's rest.

29:51.530 --> 29:53.000
Yeah, have a good night.
Great night.

29:53.170 --> 29:54.200
Have a great night.
Yeah.

29:56.330 --> 29:58.360
My instinct is to
hug you right now.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.240
- Oh. No.
- I don't think you...

30:00.450 --> 30:01.590
That's okay.
Oh.

30:01.770 --> 30:03.680
Oh, my God.
Barb.

30:03.850 --> 30:05.040
Good night.

30:09.970 --> 30:10.970
Peace.

30:23.050 --> 30:25.200
Baby, I want to trim your...

30:26.170 --> 30:28.520
Baby, I want to trim your...

30:29.170 --> 30:31.550
Baby, I want to trim your...

30:32.370 --> 30:34.360
Beautiful Christmas tree

30:35.050 --> 30:37.880
I'm gonna bring along my hatchet

30:38.570 --> 30:40.870
My beautiful Christmas balls

30:41.450 --> 30:44.400
I'll sprinkle my snow
upon your tree

30:44.570 --> 30:47.720
And hang a mistletoe
on your walls

30:48.290 --> 30:50.280
Baby, I want to trim your...

30:50.730 --> 30:54.920
Oh, beautiful Christmas tree

31:09.410 --> 31:11.520
Barb? There's
no toilet paper.

31:11.650 --> 31:12.650
Uh-oh.

31:12.810 --> 31:14.360
Would you get
a roll for me, please?

31:14.570 --> 31:15.920
Papa make a poopie?

31:16.090 --> 31:17.920
Yes. I made a poopie.

31:18.090 --> 31:19.360
Did Daddy do a doo-doo?

31:19.570 --> 31:21.600
Barb, just get
the toilet paper, please?

31:21.770 --> 31:23.360
All right.
Well, you sit tight.

31:23.450 --> 31:24.800
I'm gonna go find you some TP.

31:24.970 --> 31:25.970
Thank you.

31:28.130 --> 31:29.130
Of course.

31:30.090 --> 31:31.760
Mr. Playboy.

31:31.930 --> 31:33.600
Unbelievable.

31:34.250 --> 31:35.310
Who is that?

31:36.450 --> 31:38.440
She's a bit of a Plain Jane.

31:38.610 --> 31:39.800
Darling?
Yeah. Yup.

31:40.010 --> 31:42.720
Just, um, crack the door
and toss the roll, please.

31:42.930 --> 31:45.960
It's gonna be a little
more complicated than that.

31:46.130 --> 31:47.600
Good morning, Ned.

31:48.290 --> 31:49.430
It's Gustav.

31:49.570 --> 31:50.570
Great.

31:50.610 --> 31:53.960
As I've already told Barb,
we are a paperless household.

31:54.810 --> 31:56.120
Paperless? What?

31:56.970 --> 31:59.160
It's a paperless house, darling.

31:59.330 --> 32:00.470
I got that.

32:00.650 --> 32:04.680
But how am I supposed to
complete my business?

32:04.850 --> 32:06.480
Well, all Japanese toilets

32:06.650 --> 32:09.080
have a very effective
and pleasant cleaning spray.

32:09.290 --> 32:10.430
And I will be very happy

32:10.610 --> 32:12.760
to walk you through the entire process.
Oh, God.

32:12.930 --> 32:15.800
Ned, please locate the
control panel to your left.

32:16.850 --> 32:18.440
Okay, I see it.

32:18.610 --> 32:20.050
Now on that
control panel is a button

32:20.170 --> 32:22.760
that shows an image
of water spraying up.

32:22.970 --> 32:24.760
Okay. And I just push it?

32:24.970 --> 32:26.110
Just press it, yes.

32:30.730 --> 32:32.040
Was that cologne?

32:32.210 --> 32:33.520
Oh!
Cologne? Oh, yes!

32:33.730 --> 32:36.160
That is a designer-scented
talcum powder.

32:36.890 --> 32:39.160
But that button should
not have activated that.

32:39.330 --> 32:42.160
Ned, that is what is called Big
Pony for Men by the Ralph Lauren.

32:42.330 --> 32:43.390
I'm excited to try.

32:43.850 --> 32:46.840
Can we please just continue?
All right.

32:47.010 --> 32:48.360
Ned?
Yes.

32:48.530 --> 32:50.520
I would like to apologize
sincerely again.

32:50.690 --> 32:54.160
This is the 2018 model
that you are on right now,

32:54.330 --> 32:55.440
so they have not yet made

32:55.530 --> 32:57.520
an instruction manual
in English yet.

32:57.690 --> 33:00.840
So I'm going to take care
of this on my end, all right?

33:01.050 --> 33:03.720
So Ned, you focus on
your end in there

33:03.930 --> 33:06.520
and I will focus
on your end out here.

33:07.090 --> 33:08.520
That's too good.
This is it.

33:08.690 --> 33:10.360
This should do it, Ned.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.010
Okay. Something's whirring.

33:12.050 --> 33:14.000
Something's spinning around
in there.

33:15.050 --> 33:16.880
No! Turn it off!

33:17.050 --> 33:19.080
Turn it off!
Turn it off! Turn it off!

33:19.370 --> 33:20.370
God!

33:20.410 --> 33:21.720
Oh, scheisse!

33:21.890 --> 33:24.040
We are having some
technical difficulties.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.760
That was the vaginal cleanse.

33:25.890 --> 33:26.890
The what cleanse?

33:27.050 --> 33:28.720
I just want a square
of toilet paper.

33:28.890 --> 33:30.030
The vaginal cleanse.

33:30.210 --> 33:31.480
Which I hear is refreshing

33:31.570 --> 33:33.600
and apparently
also very stimulating.

33:34.250 --> 33:35.390
Just saying.

33:41.930 --> 33:42.930
Ned?

33:44.050 --> 33:45.050
Really?

33:45.410 --> 33:46.410
I'm so sorry, Ned...

33:46.570 --> 33:49.800
but I'm going to have to manually
reboot the system from the inside.

33:51.210 --> 33:52.240
In here?

33:52.410 --> 33:53.720
I am so sorry.

33:53.890 --> 33:54.920
Fine.

33:57.810 --> 33:58.920
Why not?

34:00.410 --> 34:02.760
Barb, would you
close the door? Sorry.

34:02.930 --> 34:04.360
It's gonna be great.

34:07.090 --> 34:08.760
Ned, I am blinders.

34:09.210 --> 34:11.480
I see nothing.
I smell nothing.

34:12.449 --> 34:14.440
The print is very small.
Mm-hmm.

34:14.610 --> 34:15.800
Okay, forgive me.

34:16.570 --> 34:18.560
I can't see the instructions.

34:22.090 --> 34:25.000
All right.
What do we have here?

34:25.290 --> 34:26.290
Hmm...

34:54.810 --> 34:59.000
I had some
stomach problems last night.

34:59.650 --> 35:01.000
I think it was the bear.

35:01.210 --> 35:03.440
I can guarantee you,
it was the bear.

35:07.010 --> 35:08.800
Turning on the fan.

35:09.530 --> 35:11.680
Great. Wunderbar.

35:16.170 --> 35:17.480
How'd it go?

35:18.050 --> 35:20.350
I am so sorry
that it took so long.

35:20.530 --> 35:22.880
Ned, I'm going to need you
to be completely still

35:23.050 --> 35:25.320
while we try to
lock in your location.

35:25.530 --> 35:27.800
I'm sitting on a toilet,
that's pretty still.

35:27.970 --> 35:30.320
Searching,
searching, und searching.

35:30.530 --> 35:32.830
And we have target achieved!

35:33.010 --> 35:34.480
And sploosh!

35:34.570 --> 35:35.680
Oh!

35:47.530 --> 35:49.520
There you go, girls.

35:49.690 --> 35:51.040
You raise chickens?

35:51.210 --> 35:52.880
All free-range.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.240
Cows, too.

35:54.410 --> 35:56.760
Pigs, artisanal llamas.

35:56.930 --> 35:58.280
Everything you eat here

35:58.370 --> 36:00.520
comes from within
a 500-yard radius.

36:00.730 --> 36:03.080
I call it
"lawn to table eating."

36:03.250 --> 36:04.250
There she is.

36:04.730 --> 36:05.920
Hey, Daisy.

36:07.370 --> 36:08.800
Oh.
Hi.

36:09.370 --> 36:11.040
Go on, get.

36:12.690 --> 36:13.850
So glad we're doing this, Ned.

36:14.410 --> 36:17.020
I feel like I know you after everything
that Steph's told me about you,

36:17.050 --> 36:18.600
but still not the same...

36:22.250 --> 36:23.520
Do you submit?
Fuck you!

36:24.890 --> 36:26.240
Gustav!
Ned, stay away!

36:27.370 --> 36:28.370
You wanna fight?

36:32.770 --> 36:33.770
Tap out!
No!

36:33.930 --> 36:35.040
You want to tap out.

36:37.130 --> 36:38.800
Okay, okay! Fine!

36:38.970 --> 36:40.440
Nice work!

36:40.610 --> 36:42.100
And your reactions
are getting quicker.

36:42.130 --> 36:43.130
Really?
Absolutely.

36:43.250 --> 36:44.250
Thanks.

36:44.290 --> 36:46.450
I am so sorry, Ned. I just
didn't want you to get hurt.

36:46.930 --> 36:50.920
Wait, so you just do
this Pink Panther thing?

36:51.090 --> 36:52.480
Pink Panther?
Pink Panther?

36:52.650 --> 36:54.920
The Pink Panther
from the Pink Panther movies.

36:55.090 --> 36:58.280
When Cato attacks Inspector
Clouseau to keep him sharp.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.060
Are those really old?
I never heard of it.

37:00.090 --> 37:01.120
I'm not familiar, either,

37:01.290 --> 37:02.800
but it sounds
absolutely charming.

37:04.610 --> 37:05.920
Pink Panther.

37:06.130 --> 37:07.480
The movies?
Mm-hmm.

37:08.330 --> 37:11.640
Cato is his assistant,
his houseboy.

37:11.810 --> 37:13.160
Houseboy?
Well, it's...

37:13.330 --> 37:15.280
That sounds racist.

37:16.130 --> 37:18.590
He did call him "my little
yellow friend." But...

37:18.810 --> 37:20.060
I'm sorry, you have to
understand, Ned.

37:20.090 --> 37:22.650
Laird is the CEO
of a massive tech company.

37:22.850 --> 37:24.440
I don't like bodyguards around

37:24.610 --> 37:27.440
so I have Goose train me in case
I get kidnapped or whatever.

37:27.650 --> 37:30.280
By the way, your Chun Kuk Do
moves were very solid.

37:30.450 --> 37:32.120
But what happened to
the evasive parkour?

37:32.290 --> 37:33.480
Ah, evasive parkour.
Yeah.

37:33.650 --> 37:35.000
I totally fucking spaced!

37:35.170 --> 37:36.800
There's always room to improve.

37:36.970 --> 37:38.000
All right.
Thanks, man.

37:38.170 --> 37:39.480
You got it, brother.

37:39.650 --> 37:41.320
All right, ciao for now,
you friends.

37:41.490 --> 37:43.920
And you guys have a lovely chat.

37:45.010 --> 37:46.610
Ned, come on. I wanna
show you my office.

37:48.490 --> 37:51.360
You know, that's like
classic Pink Panther.

37:52.810 --> 37:55.370
- This is where you work, huh?
- Yeah.

37:55.530 --> 37:58.520
I have a den in the house
where I do the financial stuff

37:58.690 --> 38:00.880
but this is where
all the big ideas happen.

38:01.050 --> 38:02.960
Don't you need a computer and...

38:03.130 --> 38:05.160
Nah. My girl Justine
records everything.

38:05.330 --> 38:06.440
Right, J?

38:06.650 --> 38:08.360
Yep, I'm here.
Hey, Ned.

38:09.210 --> 38:11.610
Hey, why don't you play back
a blip from yesterday's session?

38:11.730 --> 38:14.300
All right, hold on. Fuck. There's
so much shit up here in your Cloud.

38:14.330 --> 38:15.520
Okay, okay got it.

38:15.690 --> 38:18.360
Come on, idiot, think.
Names for games. Um...

38:18.570 --> 38:21.320
Ape Assassins Six:
Capuchin Chaos.

38:21.490 --> 38:23.840
Uh, Silverback Salsa.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.200
Baboon Bukkake.

38:26.370 --> 38:27.590
Fuck! Wow, that's awful!

38:27.690 --> 38:28.720
Bad idea.

38:28.850 --> 38:29.880
Why? Why's that?

38:29.970 --> 38:30.970
Uh...

38:31.210 --> 38:32.520
What does that mean?

38:32.650 --> 38:33.650
Bukkake?

38:33.850 --> 38:34.990
Oh, um...

38:35.210 --> 38:36.920
Just means a lot of
things are happening

38:37.050 --> 38:38.220
and you're feeling overwhelmed.

38:38.250 --> 38:39.520
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

38:39.690 --> 38:41.560
Yeah.
I've felt bukkake before.

38:41.690 --> 38:42.690
Hmm...

38:45.530 --> 38:48.040
Grab a seat. Make yourself
comf. Let's break it down.

38:48.890 --> 38:52.200
Just pop down
right here on the floor.

38:54.610 --> 38:55.830
There you go.

38:56.890 --> 39:01.040
Ned, I think you and
I have so much in common.

39:01.210 --> 39:04.520
We see something we want
and we just dive in

39:04.690 --> 39:05.690
and we take it.

39:05.730 --> 39:06.730
Know what I mean?

39:07.890 --> 39:09.000
Yeah.

39:11.530 --> 39:12.750
Which is why...

39:13.770 --> 39:15.040
...on Christmas Day...

39:15.890 --> 39:17.680
I'm going to ask Stephy
to marry me.

39:27.370 --> 39:29.930
And I know
how tight you two are.

39:30.050 --> 39:31.050
Mm-hmm.

39:31.090 --> 39:33.720
So I'd really, really

39:33.890 --> 39:34.920
like your blessing.

39:38.570 --> 39:40.280
Uh, Laird.

39:41.250 --> 39:42.580
Really appreciate
you coming to me.

39:42.610 --> 39:43.610
'Course.

39:43.730 --> 39:45.960
But, uh, the answer's no.

39:50.290 --> 39:52.120
Dude, I'm so confused.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.320
What the fuck?
What the hell?

39:54.490 --> 39:55.760
This went so much differently

39:55.890 --> 39:57.320
when I rehearsed it with Gustav.

39:57.490 --> 39:59.600
Yeah. I asked you
and you were like,

39:59.730 --> 40:01.080
"Yeah, dude. My son."

40:01.290 --> 40:03.120
Laird. Listen to me, okay.

40:03.730 --> 40:07.430
Beside the fact that I don't know
you from a hole in the wall...

40:07.610 --> 40:11.440
Stephanie is just not ready
for this step in her life.

40:11.610 --> 40:14.600
Oh, I'm totally getting
the signals that she is.

40:14.770 --> 40:17.400
I'm her father,
I know her pretty well.

40:17.610 --> 40:19.400
Okay, all right.
All right, Ned...

40:19.610 --> 40:21.240
Dude, I know
I sprung this on you.

40:21.450 --> 40:23.960
My bad. Okay?
Let's just back it up.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.160
All right?
All right.

40:25.370 --> 40:28.480
Why don't you give me a few
days to win you over, okay?

40:28.650 --> 40:29.840
And by Christmas morning...

40:30.010 --> 40:32.470
I promise, you're going to be
calling me "son."

40:32.650 --> 40:34.440
I'm gonna be calling you "Dad".

40:34.610 --> 40:35.780
Don't think
that's going to happen.

40:35.810 --> 40:37.800
I think it's gonna, Dad.

40:39.810 --> 40:40.810
Don't.

40:41.610 --> 40:42.750
Dad, come on.

40:42.970 --> 40:44.500
Don't call me "Dad."
Don't call you "Dad"?

40:44.530 --> 40:45.530
I'm not your dad.

40:45.690 --> 40:47.800
I mean, you're gonna be my dad.

40:47.890 --> 40:48.890
No. No.

40:49.010 --> 40:50.720
What, Dad?

40:53.170 --> 40:54.450
Okay, now you're
playing with me.

40:54.530 --> 40:56.360
All right. Dad.

40:58.170 --> 40:59.720
Look, Laird.

41:01.010 --> 41:03.470
Why do you even care
about what I think?

41:03.650 --> 41:05.000
You're Stephanie's father.

41:06.290 --> 41:09.000
I'm not gonna ask Stephanie to marry
me unless I have your blessing.

41:09.970 --> 41:11.160
Okay.

41:11.370 --> 41:12.640
Justine, did you get that?

41:12.810 --> 41:14.520
Totes.
Yeah, recorded every word.

41:15.850 --> 41:17.680
Totes. And totes is what?

41:17.850 --> 41:20.720
It means totally. But totally's kind of long,
so "totes" is just easier.

41:22.690 --> 41:23.690
Okay. Good.

41:23.810 --> 41:24.810
Okay.
Okay.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.040
All right, cool.
Yeah.

41:26.210 --> 41:28.510
But you gotta promise me

41:28.690 --> 41:31.840
that you won't tell Steph
anything about this.

41:32.370 --> 41:33.560
About any of this.

41:33.770 --> 41:36.360
Trust me, that is the last
thing in the world I will do.

41:36.530 --> 41:39.090
For reals, dude.
I want it to be a surprise.

41:39.250 --> 41:40.600
No word. I won't say a word.

41:40.770 --> 41:42.880
Barb and Scotty, too.
No clowning.

41:43.410 --> 41:44.440
No clowning.

41:46.610 --> 41:47.670
What?

41:47.850 --> 41:50.080
I'd just feel a lot better
about this if we pinky swore.

41:53.730 --> 41:54.760
Oh.

41:59.450 --> 42:01.240
I see what you mean.
Cool.

42:01.930 --> 42:03.680
Go get breakfast.
Okay.

42:05.210 --> 42:06.270
Fuck!

42:07.250 --> 42:08.390
Sup, guys?

42:08.570 --> 42:10.360
- Hey, boss.
- Mayhew!

42:10.930 --> 42:12.580
...took a little longer

42:12.610 --> 42:15.400
Go into the school
gonna run another banger

42:16.130 --> 42:17.960
The fuck?
Come with me immediately.

42:18.810 --> 42:20.360
The hell is this room?

42:20.570 --> 42:21.630
Randy, get the fuck out.

42:21.810 --> 42:22.920
Yes, sir, Gustav.
Mm-hmm.

42:26.050 --> 42:28.120
I am on the needles und pins.

42:28.290 --> 42:30.000
I need you to tell me
how it went right now

42:30.090 --> 42:31.120
or I'm going to burst.

42:31.330 --> 42:33.120
He said no!
What? Okay, okay.

42:33.330 --> 42:36.080
But how did you respond?

42:36.290 --> 42:38.920
I was blindsided, man.
I didn't know what to do.

42:39.130 --> 42:40.130
I challenged him.

42:40.290 --> 42:42.160
Okay.
I started calling him Dad.

42:43.330 --> 42:45.480
Oy vey.
The fuck, man!

42:45.650 --> 42:49.720
Why would you call him Dad?
You're putting him at unease!

42:50.450 --> 42:51.760
You have to find a way in.

42:51.970 --> 42:54.270
You have to do something
for him that's truly special

42:54.450 --> 42:56.800
so that he knows
that your intentions are pure.

42:56.970 --> 42:58.890
Dude, Goose, I don't know
how to talk to the guy.

42:58.970 --> 43:01.170
It's like we speak two different
languages or something.

43:01.290 --> 43:02.290
You do.
Yeah.

43:02.450 --> 43:03.640
He speaks English.

43:03.810 --> 43:07.430
And you speak English with
resounding amounts of "fuck."

43:07.610 --> 43:08.980
All right, Stephanie's been
on my case, too.

43:09.010 --> 43:10.010
Yes.
I got it.

43:10.130 --> 43:11.130
All right?
Okay.

43:11.170 --> 43:12.170
Right.
All right, man.

43:12.330 --> 43:13.330
Great.
Great.

43:13.370 --> 43:14.900
You just fucking really
hit me really hard.

43:14.930 --> 43:16.360
I know. I am sorry.

43:16.530 --> 43:19.480
It's just, Laird...

43:19.650 --> 43:22.000
...your relationship
with Miss Stephanie

43:22.210 --> 43:24.670
is very special.
It's the real deal.

43:24.810 --> 43:25.810
Hey.
Yes.

43:25.930 --> 43:28.800
Goose, I know I pay you
a shit-ton of money,

43:29.010 --> 43:30.320
but you're my best friend.

43:30.490 --> 43:32.600
Our friendship is priceless.

43:32.770 --> 43:35.000
Hey. Thanks, brother.

43:46.290 --> 43:47.480
Okay.

43:48.850 --> 43:51.040
Okay. Ow! Mercy. Mercy.

43:52.490 --> 43:53.490
Fuck.

43:55.570 --> 43:56.570
Bro, you're incredible.

43:56.730 --> 43:57.840
That was very imaginative

43:58.010 --> 43:59.400
how you took that tender moment

43:59.530 --> 44:00.930
and used it
as your pivot to attack.

44:01.010 --> 44:02.280
Yeah.
Very good.

44:06.050 --> 44:07.050
What's up, Cheese?

44:07.090 --> 44:09.040
I'm about to go to
the football game.

44:09.210 --> 44:10.400
Lions, baby!

44:10.570 --> 44:11.840
Great. How's business?

44:12.050 --> 44:13.190
Tell me something good.

44:13.370 --> 44:14.560
Oh, uh...

44:15.010 --> 44:17.080
I talked to my guy
over at Dick's Sporting Goods.

44:17.250 --> 44:18.820
Don't tell me
they're going with China, too.

44:18.850 --> 44:19.880
Worse.

44:20.050 --> 44:21.920
Freaking online banner ads.

44:22.090 --> 44:23.880
No. Damn it.
All right, listen.

44:24.530 --> 44:28.230
I'm gonna call Don Millis at
Subaru of Southern Michigan.

44:28.410 --> 44:31.360
I heard a little rumor that they might
be looking for a new dance partner.

44:31.570 --> 44:33.080
Yeah, Don, the big guy, right?

44:33.250 --> 44:35.000
You guys go back
to your car selling days.

44:35.170 --> 44:36.840
Yeah. It's worth a shot.
Listen...

44:37.010 --> 44:38.600
I need you to go in
and pull his card

44:38.730 --> 44:40.220
from my rolodex
while I look for a pen.

44:40.250 --> 44:42.040
You got it, Cheese.
No, you got it.

44:43.690 --> 44:45.280
So how goes it in Cali?

44:46.290 --> 44:48.400
It feels like we've landed
in The Twilight Zone.

44:48.570 --> 44:49.570
Did you find the card?

44:51.210 --> 44:52.270
Yeah. I got it right here.

44:52.450 --> 44:53.800
Just hang on.

44:53.930 --> 44:55.360
I have nothing
to write with here.

44:55.530 --> 44:56.960
This whole house is paperless.

44:57.090 --> 44:58.090
Paperless?

44:58.250 --> 44:59.560
Well, how do you wipe your ass?

44:59.690 --> 45:00.690
You don't.

45:00.770 --> 45:02.880
They have these Japanese
toilets that...

45:03.770 --> 45:05.850
It's one of those little
squat jobs, little squatter.

45:05.970 --> 45:08.600
No. Just... never mind.
Just give me the number.

45:08.770 --> 45:10.080
Hey, Ned, I'm here.

45:10.250 --> 45:11.560
I can take it down for you.

45:11.730 --> 45:13.960
Justine, please just...
I'm fine.

45:14.130 --> 45:15.130
Just go away.

45:15.290 --> 45:16.580
All right,
I'm just trying to help.

45:16.610 --> 45:17.890
You don't have to be
such a dick.

45:18.210 --> 45:20.280
Whoa, whoa.
Cheese, who is that?

45:20.450 --> 45:21.620
She's got a foul little mouth.

45:21.650 --> 45:23.260
Is that the kid's secretary
you fighting with?

45:23.290 --> 45:25.720
No, no, no. That's the woman
who lives in the ceiling.

45:25.810 --> 45:26.890
Cheese, what she look like?

45:26.930 --> 45:27.930
The woman who lives...

45:28.090 --> 45:29.140
You say she lives
in the ceiling?

45:29.170 --> 45:31.880
She's a disembodied
voice that...

45:32.090 --> 45:33.640
Never mind.
I'll explain later.

45:33.810 --> 45:34.840
The voice sounds sexy.

45:34.970 --> 45:36.170
Are they using somebody famous?

45:36.290 --> 45:38.200
I wouldn't say too famous.

45:38.290 --> 45:39.460
You know,
million dollars a week,

45:39.490 --> 45:41.260
biggest show in the world,
no big deal.

45:41.290 --> 45:42.290
Lou.
She can hear me?

45:42.770 --> 45:44.090
Of course I can hear you.

45:44.130 --> 45:45.270
How you doin', baby?

45:45.450 --> 45:47.400
Better now
that I'm talking with you.

45:47.610 --> 45:49.570
Just give me the number.
I'm calling him now.

45:53.970 --> 45:55.320
Let's catch some waves.

45:56.970 --> 45:58.820
- Tsunami.
- That guy's cool.

45:58.850 --> 45:59.850
Yeah, Goose is the best.

46:00.370 --> 46:01.480
Oh...

46:06.170 --> 46:07.420
Laird, I'm gonna be
honest with you, buddy.

46:07.450 --> 46:08.450
Okay.

46:08.490 --> 46:10.480
Gorillas in board shorts
is a fun touch.

46:10.650 --> 46:11.650
Yeah.
I'll give you that.

46:11.810 --> 46:13.500
But when the only mission
is to get to shore,

46:13.530 --> 46:14.890
I'm not feeling
enough drama there.

46:15.010 --> 46:16.010
You know?

46:17.130 --> 46:19.320
You know what?
You're so fucking right.

46:19.490 --> 46:20.520
Fuck!

46:20.690 --> 46:22.340
We've been developing this
limp dick for months.

46:22.370 --> 46:23.980
You come and
you play it for five minutes,

46:24.010 --> 46:25.680
you know exactly
what's wrong with it.

46:25.850 --> 46:28.000
You're a sharp little fucker.
You know that?

46:28.530 --> 46:29.840
Thank you.

46:30.010 --> 46:32.000
I mean, for real, man.
I appreciate it.

46:32.970 --> 46:34.360
It's just nice
to be listened to.

46:35.170 --> 46:36.310
What do you mean?

46:36.730 --> 46:38.300
I'm gonna be running
my dad's business one day.

46:38.330 --> 46:39.330
Uh-huh.

46:39.410 --> 46:42.320
But he won't even listen to any
of my ideas about innovation.

46:42.490 --> 46:44.000
What?
Right?

46:44.170 --> 46:45.360
You're next gen, dude.

46:45.530 --> 46:47.890
It's where all the new seeds come from.
Everyone knows that.

46:47.970 --> 46:49.140
And I told him that.
I was like...

46:49.170 --> 46:51.630
"Dad, if you're gonna unleash
me to my full potentsh...

46:51.810 --> 46:52.930
"I need a seat
at the table."

46:53.050 --> 46:54.160
He just won't listen to me.

46:54.330 --> 46:55.550
Um... Get that seat!

46:55.730 --> 46:56.730
I will get that seat.

46:56.890 --> 46:58.610
Gotta get that seat, Scotty.
That's my seat.

46:58.650 --> 46:59.870
Nobody else touch it.
No.

47:00.050 --> 47:02.680
Where is that seat?
It's at the fucking table.

47:02.890 --> 47:04.920
And I'm gonna
get that seat at that table.

47:05.090 --> 47:06.840
You deserve
a fucking throne, dawg.

47:07.010 --> 47:08.370
Yeah, the Iron Throne.
Iron Throne.

47:08.530 --> 47:10.020
Iron Throne.
Game of Thrones over here!

47:10.050 --> 47:12.180
I'm breathing fire and grabbing
titties left and right.

47:12.210 --> 47:13.380
Fucking King Joffrey up in this.

47:13.410 --> 47:14.410
Those are my titties!

47:14.610 --> 47:16.520
You're the next in line.
That's me.

47:16.890 --> 47:17.890
My man.

47:21.530 --> 47:22.720
Oh, God.

47:23.730 --> 47:27.560
They're paying
your student loans.

47:28.130 --> 47:29.160
Oh.

47:40.770 --> 47:42.080
Stamp Free Invites.

47:49.210 --> 47:50.720
Oh, man.

47:54.050 --> 47:56.080
Ho, ho, ho!

47:58.730 --> 47:59.760
Wow.

47:59.930 --> 48:01.210
Is that a horse?
That is a llama.

48:01.410 --> 48:02.410
Oh, a llama.
Hi.

48:02.490 --> 48:03.600
Hello.

48:03.770 --> 48:05.600
Oh, my goodness.
Hey, girl.

48:05.770 --> 48:07.080
We don't have those in...

48:07.290 --> 48:08.600
Dad!

48:08.770 --> 48:10.920
There you are.
This is insane!

48:11.090 --> 48:12.440
Oh, you working on the books?

48:12.610 --> 48:14.440
Uh, yeah, you know.
Just the little stuff.

48:16.090 --> 48:18.440
I was thinking about
Laird's Christmas party.

48:18.610 --> 48:20.440
Gustav gave me a preview
of the guest list.

48:20.610 --> 48:22.520
And, Dad, it is a veritable
"who's who"

48:22.610 --> 48:24.000
of Silicon Valley power players.

48:24.170 --> 48:25.800
Tyson Modell is coming!

48:25.970 --> 48:27.800
Wait, who is he?
What?

48:27.970 --> 48:28.980
He's the kid
who founded Ghostchat.

48:29.010 --> 48:30.070
Oh, right.

48:30.170 --> 48:31.660
He turned down three billion
dollars from Facebook,

48:31.690 --> 48:33.120
and he's only 24 years old.

48:33.290 --> 48:35.440
I'm gonna broker a sit-down
between you two.

48:36.650 --> 48:38.680
Dad, thank you for telling me
to pack a blazer.

48:38.850 --> 48:41.060
Now, should I throw on a tie or
should I keep it business casual?

48:41.090 --> 48:42.640
Scotty, just listen to me,
all right?

48:42.810 --> 48:44.880
Most of these Internet companies

48:44.970 --> 48:47.000
are built on smoke and mirrors.

48:47.170 --> 48:48.200
What?

48:48.330 --> 48:49.330
Don't get sucked in.

48:49.490 --> 48:51.640
That whole industry
is based on hooey.

48:51.810 --> 48:53.920
I'm gonna drop
some knowledge on you.

48:54.130 --> 48:55.320
Times are changing, Pops.

48:55.490 --> 48:57.520
And not everything you think
is hooey is hooey.

48:58.650 --> 49:00.640
Wow. That's profound.

49:01.170 --> 49:02.360
Profound.

49:03.490 --> 49:04.760
And you...

49:05.330 --> 49:07.120
Hooey-meister himself.

49:09.050 --> 49:10.880
You're nothing but an octopus.

49:11.610 --> 49:13.080
An octopus.

49:27.370 --> 49:29.120
Merry fuckin' Christmas

49:43.050 --> 49:44.360
What are you pouring?

49:44.530 --> 49:46.360
We are doing a deconstructed
eggnog tonight.

49:46.530 --> 49:48.560
Eggnog. Yes. Thank you.

49:48.730 --> 49:50.000
Where you from, boss?

49:50.090 --> 49:51.090
Michigan.

49:51.210 --> 49:52.720
Oh, Michigan.
You in the car business?

49:52.890 --> 49:55.000
Uh, no. Printing.
Ned Fleming.

49:55.170 --> 49:56.720
Elon Musk.
Elon Musk?

49:57.330 --> 49:58.470
Yeah.
Tesla, Elon Musk?

49:58.690 --> 49:59.880
Yeah.
Wow.

50:01.210 --> 50:02.210
How do you know Laird?

50:02.410 --> 50:03.680
Uh...

50:03.770 --> 50:05.560
He's dating my daughter.

50:06.770 --> 50:08.040
Uh-oh.

50:08.210 --> 50:09.400
Nice talking to you.
Yeah.

50:09.570 --> 50:10.600
What?

50:12.050 --> 50:14.080
Oh, hey! Hi, honey!

50:14.290 --> 50:16.440
Could I get a glass
of white wine, please?

50:18.210 --> 50:19.720
Ooh, hiya, handsome.
Hi!

50:19.890 --> 50:21.560
You look great.
Oh, come on.

50:21.730 --> 50:23.400
No, you do.
Thank you.

50:23.570 --> 50:26.280
I'm just getting in
the holiday spirit.

50:26.450 --> 50:30.120
So what were you talking to
Laird about for so long?

50:30.930 --> 50:32.760
I got the entire
Mayhew family saga.

50:32.930 --> 50:34.240
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

50:34.410 --> 50:37.400
No, no, turns out it was
pretty interesting actually.

50:37.570 --> 50:40.720
His mother was a secretary at
one of these tech companies.

50:40.890 --> 50:43.240
Can I interest you
in a Kobe beef slider?

50:43.410 --> 50:44.720
Ooh, yum.
Real food?

50:44.890 --> 50:46.760
Yes, I'm starving.

50:46.930 --> 50:48.480
Wait, what?

50:48.810 --> 50:50.200
Oh, God.

50:50.410 --> 50:52.040
Ma'am? Kobe squirt?
No, thanks.

50:52.210 --> 50:53.210
Thank you.

50:53.970 --> 50:55.400
It's actually pretty tasty.

50:55.570 --> 50:58.560
Anyway, she saw all these
young programmers getting rich.

50:58.730 --> 51:01.290
So she basically forced Laird

51:01.450 --> 51:05.400
to spend his entire childhood
inside, learning computers.

51:06.570 --> 51:09.240
I think that's
kind of sad, right?

51:19.850 --> 51:21.280
He ate it.
Hmm.

51:22.650 --> 51:24.120
He's an octopus.

51:24.290 --> 51:26.120
That kid is
wrapping his tentacles

51:26.250 --> 51:27.960
around every member
of this family.

51:28.130 --> 51:29.480
He's manipulating you.

51:29.650 --> 51:31.950
Darling, we need to bring this
down a notch.

51:32.130 --> 51:34.280
Okay? You think you're
at war with Laird.

51:34.450 --> 51:37.120
But he's not fighting.
It's just you.

51:37.650 --> 51:38.940
Come on,
let's go meet his friends.

51:38.970 --> 51:40.000
They look darling.

51:40.210 --> 51:41.800
Oh, God.

51:41.970 --> 51:44.920
Totally tanked porting the
thin-client apps for the JDK build.

51:45.130 --> 51:46.500
The fuck? So you had to
rewrite all the code?

51:46.530 --> 51:48.520
Mm-hmm. By myself.

51:48.690 --> 51:50.880
But did you do it?
Oh, you know I did!

51:51.050 --> 51:52.440
Hey, there they are!
Hi.

51:52.610 --> 51:53.610
Looking like a babe.

51:53.770 --> 51:54.830
Look who's looking sharp.

51:55.010 --> 51:56.280
Okay!
Hello!

51:56.450 --> 51:58.770
Tyson, these are Stephanie's parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Fleming.

51:58.850 --> 52:00.840
Oh, no. Barb and Ned, please.

52:01.010 --> 52:02.720
So it was fucked up, man.

52:02.890 --> 52:04.480
It took me two weeks

52:04.610 --> 52:06.320
on the J2EE database...

52:06.530 --> 52:08.660
trying to get the interface
to react with the server...

52:08.690 --> 52:10.680
so I can get the containers
up and running again.

52:10.850 --> 52:15.160
I'm sorry.
Tyson, what's a J2EE?

52:15.370 --> 52:17.200
Java 2 Platform
Enterprise Edition.

52:17.410 --> 52:18.680
Do you not write code?
Sorry.

52:18.850 --> 52:20.320
This guy's the worst.
Yeah.

52:20.490 --> 52:22.610
I'm actually more of a personal
relations kind of guy.

52:22.690 --> 52:25.250
Like account management, client services.
That kind of stuff.

52:25.410 --> 52:27.040
Dude, this kid is
fucking awesome.

52:27.210 --> 52:30.640
Yes, Ned is grooming Scotty
to take over our family business.

52:30.810 --> 52:31.810
That's right.

52:31.850 --> 52:33.520
We own a printing business
in Michigan.

52:33.690 --> 52:34.900
Really?
I'm sure you're familiar

52:34.930 --> 52:36.250
with those two siblings
over there

52:36.370 --> 52:38.040
since you're
in the printing business.

52:38.210 --> 52:40.480
Yo, brother-sister act!
You gotta meet this guy.

52:40.570 --> 52:41.570
Hello!

52:41.730 --> 52:43.400
Hey! Blaine
and Missy Pederman.

52:43.570 --> 52:44.710
Hi, I'm Barb Fleming.

52:44.890 --> 52:46.200
This is my husband.
Ned.

52:46.370 --> 52:48.830
I'm Scott Fleming.
Nice to meet you.

52:49.010 --> 52:50.680
I'm sorry, we were told
we might know you,

52:50.770 --> 52:52.040
but I'm afraid we don't.

52:52.210 --> 52:54.720
Blaine and Missy started
Stamp Free Invites.

52:56.570 --> 52:58.400
Oh, okay.

52:58.570 --> 52:59.710
Right.

52:59.890 --> 53:00.890
What's up?

53:01.050 --> 53:02.420
Did the server forget
to send a reminder

53:02.450 --> 53:04.280
for your birthday party
or something?

53:04.450 --> 53:07.400
No, he is actually
in the printing business.

53:08.250 --> 53:09.720
Oh, shit.
Whoops.

53:09.850 --> 53:10.850
No, no.

53:10.890 --> 53:12.220
We didn't put you
out of business or anything?

53:12.250 --> 53:13.250
No.

53:13.370 --> 53:15.640
What? Ruin our business?
No, no.

53:15.730 --> 53:17.480
We're doing quite well.
Thank you.

53:17.570 --> 53:18.600
Oh, that's great!

53:18.730 --> 53:20.100
Good for you!
Honestly, good for you.

53:20.130 --> 53:21.800
We love little
mom-and-pop printers.

53:21.930 --> 53:24.040
So inspirational.
So important. Mm-hmm.

53:24.130 --> 53:25.560
My dad has more of a factory.

53:25.770 --> 53:27.100
Not to brag,
but we're a pretty big shop.

53:27.130 --> 53:28.900
People need paper. They need
something to write on.

53:28.930 --> 53:30.620
They love the feel of that
card stock in their hands.

53:30.650 --> 53:31.650
Yeah.

53:31.770 --> 53:33.600
I've never heard
anyone say that.

53:33.730 --> 53:36.290
Hmm. We have not
found that at all.

53:36.450 --> 53:37.590
Yeah. Nope.

53:37.770 --> 53:39.380
I think we come from
two different worlds.

53:39.410 --> 53:40.440
Yes, we do.

53:40.610 --> 53:43.600
You better start learning code
pretty fucking fast, dude.

53:43.770 --> 53:45.040
Dude, Ned was crushing it

53:45.250 --> 53:47.760
since before you two were fighting
over your mother's titties.

53:48.250 --> 53:49.690
Our mom didn't breastfeed us.

53:49.810 --> 53:51.480
Laird, you know
we had a wet nurse.

53:51.650 --> 53:52.650
Oh, I can tell.

53:53.450 --> 53:55.140
Boy, I'll tell you,
I don't know what's going on.

53:55.170 --> 53:56.170
I'm lost.

53:56.290 --> 53:57.560
I'm overwhelmed.
Yeah! Me, too.

53:57.730 --> 53:59.600
There's bukkake
floating all around me.

53:59.810 --> 54:00.840
What?
Hm?

54:01.010 --> 54:02.120
What's bukkake?

54:02.290 --> 54:03.320
Oh, Laird told me.

54:03.490 --> 54:05.000
It means when you're overwhelmed

54:05.130 --> 54:06.330
and you got too much going on.

54:06.450 --> 54:08.160
Oh, my gosh.
Can't figure things out.

54:08.330 --> 54:10.630
Then, I'm drowning in bukkake
at this point.

54:10.810 --> 54:11.940
Okay, I'm gonna be
real with you guys.

54:11.970 --> 54:13.050
It means jizz on your face.

54:14.490 --> 54:15.490
I'm sorry?

54:15.650 --> 54:17.000
Bukkake means covered in jizz.

54:17.170 --> 54:18.360
Tons of jizz, ejaculate.

54:18.530 --> 54:19.920
Usually after a gangbang.

54:20.090 --> 54:21.310
Not as bad as it sounds.

54:21.490 --> 54:22.680
Yeah,
post-gangbang.

54:22.850 --> 54:25.600
Or during. Depends
if someone finishes early.

54:25.810 --> 54:26.870
What the heck?

54:26.970 --> 54:28.180
I was trying to
protect you, dude.

54:28.210 --> 54:29.800
- Protect me?
- Fucking Justine.

54:29.970 --> 54:31.110
You mean embarrass me?

54:31.290 --> 54:32.620
It was a really
sensitive conversation.

54:32.650 --> 54:33.660
I didn't want to start talking

54:33.690 --> 54:34.780
about guys jerking off
on each other.

54:34.810 --> 54:36.300
Why'd you tell me
it was overwhelming?

54:36.330 --> 54:37.470
Justine brought it up!

54:37.650 --> 54:40.160
I hope this is an opportune
time to show a video.

54:40.330 --> 54:41.330
It's not.

54:41.370 --> 54:42.640
- Oh, God!
- Yeah.

54:42.850 --> 54:44.480
Oh, and this
is a teaching moment.

54:44.650 --> 54:45.960
- Here's another.
- Oh, my God.

54:46.050 --> 54:47.300
- No. Scotty.
- Don't look at that.

54:47.330 --> 54:49.120
It's all good.
You don't have to see this.

54:49.290 --> 54:50.840
Is that you?

54:54.330 --> 54:55.360
No.

54:55.570 --> 54:56.790
Oh, my God.

55:06.330 --> 55:07.960
We alive right now, now

55:09.690 --> 55:11.000
Let's get hot right now

55:11.570 --> 55:13.440
We don't give a damn about money

55:13.530 --> 55:14.880
We alive right now

55:15.370 --> 55:17.280
All we do is party, party

55:17.370 --> 55:18.480
And get hot right now

55:24.690 --> 55:26.040
Are you okay?

55:26.650 --> 55:28.920
Yeah!

55:29.090 --> 55:30.520
Come on, Daddy.
You're okay!

55:30.730 --> 55:32.520
Okay, I just need to
take a breather. One...

55:34.370 --> 55:35.560
Do it again...

55:35.730 --> 55:37.280
Lost my mind,
I'm a lose it again

55:37.370 --> 55:39.000
I love this kid.

55:39.170 --> 55:41.360
Oh, my God!

55:41.570 --> 55:43.000
Rage, rage the night away

55:43.090 --> 55:44.680
Forget about the money
I spent today

55:44.890 --> 55:46.480
Rage, rage the night away

55:46.570 --> 55:49.360
DDT your ass.
I love you, dawg.

55:50.450 --> 55:52.400
Forget about the money
I spent today

56:10.090 --> 56:11.200
Hi, Pops.

56:12.810 --> 56:14.330
I just need some fresh air.
Can I come?

56:23.130 --> 56:25.720
We've always been straight
with each other, haven't we?

56:25.890 --> 56:26.890
Yeah, of course.

56:27.050 --> 56:28.300
Okay, I need to
ask you a question.

56:28.330 --> 56:29.440
And I mean this honestly.

56:29.610 --> 56:30.800
Okay. What?

56:30.970 --> 56:31.970
You're scaring me.

56:32.050 --> 56:33.110
No. It's just...

56:34.330 --> 56:35.330
What?

56:36.410 --> 56:37.600
Why Laird?

56:37.770 --> 56:39.120
I mean, come on.
Oh, my God.

56:39.290 --> 56:40.880
Why?
Dad.

56:41.090 --> 56:43.080
You are so smart
and you're beautiful.

56:43.250 --> 56:45.440
You could be dating anyone.
Why?

56:45.610 --> 56:46.970
I don't get it.
You want the truth?

56:47.090 --> 56:48.230
Yes.

56:48.770 --> 56:50.600
He kind of reminds me of you.

56:52.130 --> 56:53.130
What?

56:54.290 --> 56:55.430
Me?
Yes.

56:55.650 --> 56:57.360
Okay, I need you
to explain that one.

56:57.450 --> 56:58.450
How?

56:58.610 --> 57:01.120
You're both the most honest
and authentic men that I know.

57:01.290 --> 57:02.740
It comes out
in totally different ways.

57:02.770 --> 57:03.770
Oh, well...

57:03.850 --> 57:05.280
Laird has literally no filter.

57:05.490 --> 57:08.000
I don't know that to be true.
Is that right?

57:08.170 --> 57:09.680
Okay.
Sorry.

57:09.850 --> 57:11.800
Trying to help you out here.

57:12.090 --> 57:14.800
But I swear his heart
is always in the right place.

57:17.650 --> 57:19.320
He's a very good guy.

57:20.370 --> 57:21.800
And I love him.

57:26.850 --> 57:27.850
You love him?

57:33.690 --> 57:34.960
What?

57:35.850 --> 57:37.200
I'm processing.

57:37.370 --> 57:38.530
We had the...
Very funny, Dad.

57:40.330 --> 57:42.120
Okay. Okay.

57:42.890 --> 57:44.520
Just try to be cordial.

57:44.690 --> 57:45.720
I will. I'll try.

57:45.890 --> 57:47.560
Okay? I'll try.
Try to what?

57:47.730 --> 57:49.360
I'll try to just...

57:50.690 --> 57:55.000
...understand
that person better.

57:57.690 --> 57:58.690
Come here.

58:09.690 --> 58:10.720
Hey.

58:12.690 --> 58:13.690
Hi.

58:13.770 --> 58:16.680
Long night.
What are you doing?

58:18.090 --> 58:19.560
Just chilling.

58:20.570 --> 58:22.600
Barb, is that my shirt?

58:22.770 --> 58:24.680
I don't know, is it?

58:24.850 --> 58:26.400
Want me to take it off?

58:26.570 --> 58:29.080
Would you, please?
I only brought two dress shirts.

58:29.250 --> 58:30.520
I really don't feel like ironing

58:30.610 --> 58:32.040
while I'm on this trip.

58:33.890 --> 58:35.520
I'm so exhausted.

58:37.530 --> 58:38.590
Oh, yeah.

58:38.770 --> 58:40.080
Take it off, baby.

58:40.250 --> 58:43.680
Yeah! Take it off.
Take off those shoes, girl.

58:43.850 --> 58:47.120
Let me see those feet.
I wanna see those feet!

58:47.290 --> 58:48.650
Did you hit your head
or something?

58:48.770 --> 58:51.070
Yeah. Let me
smell that shoe.

58:51.210 --> 58:52.220
You don't wanna smell my shoe.

58:52.250 --> 58:53.250
Yeah, I want feet!

58:53.370 --> 58:55.400
I want those feet
out of those socks.

58:55.570 --> 58:56.880
Barb, what happened to you?

58:57.050 --> 58:58.920
I am so stoned right now.

58:59.050 --> 59:00.050
What?

59:00.210 --> 59:02.280
Yeah, I am so baked.

59:02.450 --> 59:04.240
I am like super baked.

59:04.410 --> 59:06.600
Barb. What?
Where did you?

59:06.770 --> 59:09.400
I was very lonely
after you guys left.

59:09.570 --> 59:13.880
And I saw this guy,
and he had a cigarette.

59:14.050 --> 59:16.480
I thought it was one of those
electronic cigarettes.

59:16.650 --> 59:17.710
They're called E-cigs.

59:17.810 --> 59:18.810
Yeah.

59:18.970 --> 59:20.760
But turns out...

59:20.930 --> 59:22.760
I was vaping.

59:22.930 --> 59:23.960
What?

59:24.170 --> 59:25.440
I was vaping.

59:25.610 --> 59:26.610
What is that?

59:26.770 --> 59:29.720
It's marijuana that comes
out of some kind of machine.

59:29.930 --> 59:31.600
Keep your voice down!
Ned, it's legal.

59:31.770 --> 59:34.600
Oh, this poor boy
had it for sleep apnea.

59:34.810 --> 59:37.600
At his age? So sad.
I'm going to bed. That's it.

59:37.810 --> 59:39.680
No, no, no. Wait!

59:39.850 --> 59:41.100
- Barbara, I'm tired.
- Wait a minute.

59:41.130 --> 59:42.130
And I've got a headache.

59:42.290 --> 59:44.280
Let's play a little bit, huh?
No, no.

59:44.450 --> 59:46.600
I'll give you
one of my patented massages.

59:46.690 --> 59:48.080
Barb.
Let's take the Little Cheese

59:48.170 --> 59:49.280
out for a spin.
No, no, no.

59:49.450 --> 59:50.850
Come on, let me just see him.
Don't.

59:50.970 --> 59:52.580
I just want to see him.
Don't call him that.

59:52.610 --> 59:53.670
Please. Come on.

59:53.850 --> 59:54.880
Oh, my God!

59:54.970 --> 59:57.530
You used to love getting high
and fooling around.

59:57.690 --> 59:59.080
What? Barb! No, Barb.

59:59.290 --> 01:00:00.980
We're on vacation!
But someone could walk...

01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:02.480
There's no locks on the door!

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:03.650
What?

01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:06.520
Justine! Do you have any Kiss?

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:08.320
Oh, hell yeah!

01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:09.800
Are you kids gonna do it?
Yes.

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:12.160
No.
We're doing it already.

01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:13.600
We're doing it right now.
Barb!

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:15.170
I'm doing it with my feet.
One foot.

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:17.320
That's Kiss!
Honey, you love Kiss!

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:18.880
But not right now.

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:25.310
Ned was made for loving Barb

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:26.520
Yell!

01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:32.920
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:34.100
Look what I learned
at the party.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.130
What?

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:37.530
There was this real cute girl,
and she was going like this.

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:41.000
She was doing this cute,
new dance.

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:42.840
You're gonna
throw your back out.

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.640
I'm not gonna throw my...

01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:45.870
I'll throw you out.

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:47.770
Let me get on you.
Wait, do you smell that?

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.400
I'm putting him in.
What is that scent?

01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:50.710
There. Oh, it's in.

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.520
What is that?
Oh, my God.

01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:55.720
Oh, my God!

01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:58.880
Is that Indian Summer
by Priscilla Presley?

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:01.200
I used to wear
that perfume in the 90s.

01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:03.200
Yup, pumping some in.

01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:06.080
I saw you mentioned it on your
college reunion's Facebook page.

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:07.880
I know what you like, Ned.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:09.920
Oh, I know you do, dawg.

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:12.320
Yeah, get in there. Get it!

01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:14.000
Barb!
Get you some!

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.920
Get it! Good. Oh, that's...
Okay.

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:17.560
Yeah. You're almost in there.

01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:19.560
No, you're, like,
six inches away from it.

01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:22.000
Get in there.
Yeah, that's the spirit.

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:23.720
Barb.
Oh! Yeah!

01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:24.890
Barb!
That's good.

01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:26.880
Oh, that's good.
You're getting into it now.

01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:28.200
- That's it!
- No!

01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:30.440
No, no!
Take me! Yes! Take me!

01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:31.670
I'm not...
Take me.

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:33.740
I'm taking you right to bed.
That's what I'm doing.

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:35.040
Here you go. Yes.

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:36.240
No, I wanna do sex.

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:37.740
We are not gonna do sex.
No, honey.

01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:38.880
But I want to.

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:40.340
Justine, turn all the music
off please...

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:41.400
I wanna do it.

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:43.100
...and leave us alone
for the rest of the night.

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:44.350
It's gonna be full penetration!

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:45.750
Would you stop!

01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:51.600
Psst... Hey, girl.

01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:53.600
Fifth button from the right.

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:56.240
You'll thank me later.

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:12.730
Mama, won't you please let me
Mama, won't you please let me

01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:13.960

Mama, won't you please let me

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:27.360

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:29.800
Mama won't you please

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.270
Mama do the hump

01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:34.800
Mama won't you please

01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:37.280

Mama won't you please

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:54.000
There we go, girls.

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:31.410
Oh!

01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:33.510
Okay. You all right?

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:35.200
Yeah. Oh, man.

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:36.400
That's it.

01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:37.820
Dude, I thought
I was gonna make it.

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:39.360
I know. You almost did, but...

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.560
Very good evasive parkour.

01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:43.360
Yes, but the last move
you ate shit.

01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:44.640
I know.

01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:46.060
I'll put you on the table later

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:47.370
and we'll do
a little adjustment.

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:01.560
Ah!

01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:05.400
Christmas tree shopping
with the Big Cheese.

01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:07.720
Ned, you don't know
how excited I am about this.

01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:09.840
I don't know
if I ever mentioned this,

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:12.170
but I never had a father
to do this kind of stuff with.

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:14.550
I'm glad we're getting
a chance to hang out.

01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:16.600
That's nice.

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:19.720
Uh, it's not getting me hard.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.040
You need an erection
to buy a Christmas tree?

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:24.610
Helps.

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:27.920
I wanna get to know you better.

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:29.400
I mean, you're so perfect.

01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:32.320
Seriously, did you always
have your shit together?

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:33.410
Oh, heck no.

01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:35.280
I got fired selling Datsuns.

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:39.750
How'd you fuck up
selling little dogs?

01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:42.920
No. Datsuns.

01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:44.640
What's that?

01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:45.870
It's a car. Doesn't matter.

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:47.320
It doesn't exist anymore.

01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:48.960
But you're still here.

01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:53.800
You ever get nervous
about shifting tides?

01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:57.590
Well, you know, every business
has its ups and downs.

01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:59.320
Yeah, I know it, bro.

01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:01.950
Guerrilla Gang, it's been
struggling a little bit.

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:04.120
Really?

01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:06.560
Yeah, it's just a fucking
tough landscape, dude.

01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:10.480
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

01:05:11.770 --> 01:05:13.440
Whoa.

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:16.630
Chills. Did you
come up with that?

01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:19.120
No, Laird.

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:22.290
Whoa, whoa.

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:25.000
There she blows, Ned.

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:27.160
It's our motherfucking tree.

01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:29.600
Why not? It'll look great
opposite your moose.

01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:32.360
Ned, Ned. Not that one.

01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:34.960
That one.

01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:39.920
Oh, no. See, Laird...

01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:41.480
that doesn't belong to this lot.

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:42.650
See, it's owned by...

01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:44.640
Wet games?
Wewt Games.

01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:46.030
Like, 'woot-woot'.

01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:47.600
I know those dudes.
They're dicks.

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:49.360
Tried to rip off Ape Assassins.

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:51.800
Plus, it's the first Christmas
with the family, dude.

01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:52.970
Gotta do it right.

01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:54.130
Hey, buddy.

01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:55.170
Yeah.

01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:56.640
Can I borrow that chainsaw?

01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:57.840
Are you serious?

01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:59.490
Yeah.

01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:02.160
Fucking...

01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:04.000
Come on.

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:06.830
Will you hurry up?

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:08.520
I'm trying.

01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:10.990
Come on, guy.
I need my chainsaw back.

01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:12.520
Just give me a second.

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:13.930
Should we call an ambulance now,

01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:15.360
or wait till he loses a finger?

01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:18.510
Can I borrow those?

01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:20.630
Have at it.

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:22.720
Okay. Laird just...

01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:23.950
Okay.

01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:25.050
Hand it over?

01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:26.200
You sure, Ned?
Yup.

01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:33.480
Oh!

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:35.880
Total fucking Dad move!

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:51.750
Oh, shit!

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:54.450
You keep on dancing
and the room gets hot

01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:58.280
You drive us wild,
we'll drive you crazy

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:05.360
I wanna rock and roll
all night...

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:08.200
Love Kiss!

01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:11.240
Kiss, baby!

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:12.800
These guys are awesome!

01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:15.600
Stephanie and I do karaoke
to Kiss all the time.

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:17.760
Dude, I know,
that's why I put it on!

01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:19.760
And we do
a pretty good job, too,

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:21.070
if I might say so.
Oh, man.

01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:23.200
That's cute.
Yeah.

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:27.560
Listen, Laird,
I've been thinking about

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:29.240
our teepee talk yesterday.

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:30.920
Oh, dude, me too.

01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:32.920
I've got so many ideas
for the proposal.

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:34.920
No.
No. Ned, hear me out.

01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:37.280
I was thinking about
getting the Goodyear blimp,

01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:38.530
releasing a thousand doves.

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:39.640
No. Wait.

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:41.170
Laird, just hold on
a second, okay?

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:42.290
Slow down.
Okay.

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:46.080
Look, I get it that Stephanie
really likes you.

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:47.250
But...
Uh-huh.

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:49.600
Look. Man to man.
Yeah.

01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:52.330
Now is not the time.

01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:55.560
Dude, Ned, I thought we were
getting past all that.

01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:57.120
No, it's not me.

01:07:57.290 --> 01:07:58.430
It's all about Stephanie.

01:07:58.610 --> 01:07:59.670
Stephanie?
Yes.

01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:00.810
I don't know, dude.

01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:03.960
These last few semesters
are gonna be so intense.

01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:05.600
And then there's graduation,

01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:06.960
and she'll be looking for a job.

01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:08.650
And who knows
where that will take her.

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:10.320
It's just...
All right, Ned...

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:11.780
I wasn't supposed to
tell you this,

01:08:11.810 --> 01:08:13.520
but I just wanna
put your mind at ease.

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:18.120
Stephanie is not going back
to school next semester.

01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:20.810
What?

01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:24.910
Dude, I know you're probably
shocked, but do not worry.

01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:26.800
She's already
got this awesome job

01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:28.479
lined up
at this non-profit.

01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:32.000
What organization
is that exactly?

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:36.830
She's going to be president of
the Laird Mayhew Foundation.

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:43.200
That's me.

01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:46.149
Stephanie!

01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:47.330
Barb?

01:08:47.529 --> 01:08:50.040
Everybody upstairs right now,
family meeting!

01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:51.859
Ned, would you like
me to schedule a meeting?

01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:52.920
Oh, fuck off!

01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:54.010
Just trying to help.

01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:55.540
You don't always have to be
such an asshole.

01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:56.790
Yes, I do!

01:08:57.529 --> 01:08:59.359
Dad.
You are so dead.

01:08:59.529 --> 01:09:01.960
Shut up. Of course
I was going to tell you.

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:03.640
I told Mom yesterday
at the mall.

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.819
I was just waiting for
the right time to bring it up

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.180
and that hasn't happened.
Wait a minute.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:08.210
You knew?

01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:12.359
Honestly, honey, we thought
you might freak out.

01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:14.399
So we decided to wait until

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:16.720
after Christmas to bring it up.

01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:18.930
But, okay, he told you
about the foundation, right?

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:20.840
Yes.
Yes, okay.

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:22.340
This is a big part of
why I wanted you

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:24.399
to come out here and meet Laird.

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:28.910
Stephanie, even if he wasn't
this abject lunatic,

01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:30.200
which he is,

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:33.240
I still wouldn't understand why.

01:09:33.450 --> 01:09:34.920
You've only got
a few semesters left

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:36.160
before you graduate.

01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:38.040
Why would you
just throw that away?

01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:39.540
I'm not throwing
anything away, Dad.

01:09:39.569 --> 01:09:40.700
The year I spent
in Central America

01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:42.040
doing this kind of work,

01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:46.399
I know you think that I'm
making some rash decision

01:09:46.569 --> 01:09:47.569
and I'm not.

01:09:47.729 --> 01:09:50.080
We've spent months
figuring it out.

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:51.470
All the months

01:09:51.569 --> 01:09:53.680
where you didn't even tell us
you had a boyfriend.

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:54.850
All those months?

01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:56.720
Darling...

01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:58.400
I think you should hear her out

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:00.920
because it actually sounds
very interesting.

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:02.050
Does it?

01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:04.080
Are you willing to listen to me?

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:05.250
Give it your best shot.

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:08.760
The plan is to focus
on women's health

01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:10.740
as a function of environmental
change in the Third World.

01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:11.770
Right.
All right.

01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:12.940
And when all that
goes belly-up,

01:10:12.970 --> 01:10:14.170
you know what you're left with?

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.240
What?
Being a college dropout.

01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:17.920
That's it.
You don't get it.

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:19.090
Oh, I don't get it?

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:20.920
No, you just, like,
don't get it at all.

01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:22.760
Oh. What is that?

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:25.390
It's a tattoo.

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:26.920
With his name?
You got a tattoo?

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:29.080
You've marked your body
with his name on it.

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:30.310
Look at that, Barb!

01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:31.920
Oh, no.

01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:33.800
That is so cute.

01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:35.250
Let me see.
I wanna see.

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:37.170
Laird's been telling me
I should get a neck tat.

01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:38.550
I see what Laird is doing here.

01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:40.570
I see what he's doing.

01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:44.120
He is trying to put his
imprint on this entire family.

01:10:44.290 --> 01:10:47.400
And that is why we've got
all these secrets now.

01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:48.960
And it's all because of him!

01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:51.000
Why do you have such
a big problem with Laird?

01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:53.000
Great question.
You know why? Why?

01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:55.120
Because of his influence,

01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:56.640
you drop out of college.

01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:59.000
Because of his influence,
you get a "too."

01:10:59.170 --> 01:11:00.290
Dad, I think you mean "tat."

01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:01.410
You definitely mean "tat."

01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:02.580
I mean "tat?"
It's not a "too?"

01:11:02.610 --> 01:11:03.740
"Tat." No, it's not a "too."
No.

01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:05.280
No, I saw it on Geraldo.

01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:07.200
They call them "toos," okay?
Okay.

01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:09.440
This is what's going to be
your downward spiral.

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:11.200
First you get a tattoo,

01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:12.960
then you start vaporizing.

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:14.760
- What?
- You're vaporizing.

01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:16.480
What are you talking about?

01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:19.600
When you have...
It's an e-cigarette.

01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:22.440
But instead of tobacco
or a fake tobacco,

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:24.320
no, you have marijuana
in that e-cigarette.

01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:25.710
Dad, I know what it is.
Yeah.

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:27.280
How do you know what it is?

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:30.320
Because I've been around.
Haven't I?

01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:33.160
Mm-hmm.

01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:34.920
Then you go
from there to heroin.

01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:36.040
Mm-hmm, that's right.

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:38.440
After that, after you
get hooked on drugs,

01:11:38.530 --> 01:11:39.610
you know what happens next?

01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:40.690
What?

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:41.820
You'll become a hooker,
a prostitute...

01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:42.960
a pimp's bitch.

01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:44.720
That's what's
going to happen to you.

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:46.160
I see it very clearly.

01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:48.830
Oh, my...
How long do I have?

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:50.880
I'm glad you asked.
Not long.

01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:54.200
You keep going down this path,
at this rate, not long.

01:11:54.370 --> 01:11:56.830
You're clearly not in a place
to listen to me right now.

01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:58.050
So I'm gonna go.

01:11:58.210 --> 01:11:59.530
Thank you, Pops,
for the guidance.

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:00.880
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:49.400
When the line froze,
what did I see?

01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:52.080
A bad mother fucker
standing next to me

01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:53.400
Boom!

01:12:57.610 --> 01:12:59.910
Be free like a bird
so today I'ma fly

01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:02.550
Bad, bad motherfucker
'til the day I die

01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:05.560
Boss, let me get this straight.

01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:06.840
You want me to hack into

01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:08.760
Stephanie's boyfriend's computer

01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:10.520
and find out
if there's any record

01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:12.080
of him starting a foundation?

01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:13.290
Yes, I do.

01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:15.360
Listen, Kevin,
you are my IT guy.

01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:16.650
I've got nowhere else to turn.

01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:19.110
You know I've always thought
so highly of Stephanie.

01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:21.590
Yeah, she thinks
a lot about you.

01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:23.640
Really? Oh, yeah.

01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:25.600
That's so crazy.
Now, listen.

01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:27.140
I know that this character
has money,

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:29.090
but there's something about
this whole foundation

01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:30.450
that sounds like
a bunch of hooey.

01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:34.000
If this guy's running hooey,
then I'm gonna find out.

01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:35.370
Okay, first thing's first, Ned,

01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:37.000
you have to break into
his computer

01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:39.800
and download a program
that I'm gonna send you.

01:13:39.970 --> 01:13:41.280
That's hacking?

01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:45.960
I took a shower,
washing every body part...

01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:49.320
Yeah, okay.
I'm getting online.

01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:52.960
Kevin, what are you doing?
Huh, baby?

01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:55.360
Oh, I'm helping Ned
with something IT-related.

01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:56.800
Oh, tell Ned I said hi.

01:13:56.970 --> 01:13:57.970
Okay.

01:13:58.850 --> 01:14:00.050
All right, webcam's on.

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:02.730
Okay, I'm in the office.

01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:04.800
All right, now get
in front of the computer.

01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:07.880
All right, good.
Press the spacebar.

01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:11.320
Oh, darn.
It's asking for a password.

01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:12.450
No surprise.

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:16.160
A lot of guys have passwords related
to their girlfriends or their wives.

01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:19.840
Kevin, you're a genius.
That's what I have!

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:22.840
It's "Barbsguy1989."
The year we were married.

01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:26.310
The younger generation tends
to go a little bit racier.

01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:28.290
I'm gonna get into some
sensitive areas here,

01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:29.680
so just bear with me.

01:14:29.850 --> 01:14:33.240
We need to focus on Stephanie's
more defining qualities

01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:35.040
that this guy might latch onto.

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:36.570
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:14:36.690 --> 01:14:38.360
Would you just get to it?

01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:40.360
For example, like,
would you say...

01:14:40.530 --> 01:14:42.480
Stephanie has perky breasts?

01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:45.350
What?
Okay.

01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:47.160
I would say yes,
because she does.

01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:49.840
Please try "Stephanie's boobs"
one word, no caps.

01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:51.040
I'm her dad!

01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:52.880
I understand that
you're her dad,

01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:54.640
but you gotta think like him.

01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:55.880
Okay?

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:02.730
No.

01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:04.400
We're gonna have to
kick it up a notch.

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:06.240
You said that this guy was edgy?

01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:09.400
Please try
"Stephanie's tight ass."

01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:10.560
Give that a whirl.

01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:13.600
Are you messing with me, Dingle?

01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:15.680
I wish I was messing with you.

01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:17.040
I'm trying to help you, Ned.

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:19.440
Make the two "S's"
dollar signs in "ass."

01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:20.720
God!

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:23.240
I am going straight to hell
just for typing this.

01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:25.080
Tight ass.

01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:27.840
No.
Hey, guys?

01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:29.730
Do you wanna raise the volume
on the movie?

01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:30.770
Okay.

01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:33.680
Okay. I'm just gonna list
some off, you type them in.

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:36.400
All right,
try "Stephanie's sweet slit."

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:38.560
I am not writing that!

01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:40.440
Okay,
"Stephanie's pink canoe."

01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:41.650
No!

01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:43.050
Listen, this isn't fun for me.

01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:48.560
Oh, my God.
What is it?

01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:50.120
It's the password!

01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:52.320
The one piece of paper
in the entire house.

01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:53.900
What does it say?
I'm gonna log it in.

01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:56.080
"Stephanie's dude."

01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:59.160
Aw, that's actually sweet.

01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:00.470
"2016."

01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:01.650
Boom! We're in.

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:02.810
Oh, gosh!

01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:04.110
What? What is it?

01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:06.240
It's a nude photograph
of Stephanie.

01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:07.960
May I see it, please?
No.

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:09.130
May I please see it?

01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:10.720
I said no!
Okay.

01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:12.810
Go to your EarthLink account
in the web browser.

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:15.600
EarthLink, EarthLink, okay.
Press.

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:17.270
I give it my password.

01:16:17.610 --> 01:16:18.640
Okay.

01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:20.920
Okay.
I just emailed you a file.

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.920
Download that and
open it on his desktop.

01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:25.840
Ned, we're gonna fucking nail this guy!
We're good!

01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:27.480
We're hacking, baby!

01:16:27.650 --> 01:16:28.840
We're gonna nail him.

01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:31.250
We're gonna nail him the way
he's been nailing Stephanie.

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:32.500
Just come with me right now.

01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:33.530
What?

01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:34.660
Why are you
taking me to my office?

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:35.720
Everyone's downstairs.

01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:37.440
Oh, shit! Someone's coming!
Okay. Escape!

01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:38.560
Oh, God!

01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:39.850
Baby, what are we doing?

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:41.280
Christmas Eve is about to start.

01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:43.250
What is the matter with you?
What's happening?

01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:44.780
I specifically told you...
Don't say anything.

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:48.160
that I wanted to be the one to
tell my dad about Stanford.

01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:50.170
I know. We were just...
Then why did you do it?

01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:52.630
We were bonding so hard,
it just sort of slipped out.

01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:55.600
You clearly have no
idea what this means to him.

01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:58.190
He was so proud of me
when I got into Stanford.

01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:02.320
He worked so hard
to make it happen.

01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:06.000
Me dropping out is like
a huge slap in his face.

01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:07.890
Okay.

01:17:08.010 --> 01:17:10.200
I just never had anyone
like him in my life before.

01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:11.840
Oh, my God!

01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:14.480
I thought we could
just talk it out.

01:17:14.650 --> 01:17:17.210
You could see how that's not
your place to do that, right?

01:17:17.410 --> 01:17:18.470
Okay. Maybe not.

01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:19.790
Definitely not.

01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:22.320
Okay, you're right.
He was super pissed.

01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:26.400
Sometimes I feel like
you're not capable

01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:28.200
of being in a relationship.

01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:30.640
It's time that you get a handle

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:32.570
on these father issues.

01:17:32.650 --> 01:17:33.680
Wow.

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:35.360
That's the truth.

01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:38.400
When you call me on my shit...

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:42.400
My God! It makes me
feel so close to you.

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:45.760
Your honesty has
such an effect on me.

01:17:47.050 --> 01:17:49.400
You're making me so
fucking horny right now.

01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:50.910
- What?
- Yeah.

01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:52.560
That face is boner-bait.

01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:54.570
Can you not see
that I'm mad at you?

01:17:54.730 --> 01:17:56.140
Yeah, I see it.
That's what's...

01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:57.820
Oh, my God.
You're driving me crazy!

01:17:57.850 --> 01:17:59.680
You're not listening to me.

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:01.610
I'm listening.

01:18:02.250 --> 01:18:03.520
I'm sorry.

01:18:03.690 --> 01:18:04.750
Do you...

01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:07.600
You need therapy.

01:18:11.050 --> 01:18:12.270
Not working.
No?

01:18:12.450 --> 01:18:13.720
Mm-mm. Not today, buddy.

01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:15.280
Okay. How about this?

01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:17.040
Is this working?

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:20.520
A little bit.

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:22.390
Okay, how about this?

01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:28.640
Okay. That's working
a little bit more.

01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:30.360
Laird, I love you.

01:18:30.570 --> 01:18:31.880
But I'm still mad at you.

01:18:32.050 --> 01:18:33.400
I'm sorry.

01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:44.640
I'm so sorry.
No, no!

01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:46.090
Okay?

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:47.330
Yes!

01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:48.450
No!

01:18:51.450 --> 01:18:52.450
You...

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:54.980
I'm gonna make it up to you.
What is happening?

01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:57.530
You just lie back, and I'll give you
an early Christmas present.

01:18:57.570 --> 01:18:59.600
You are such a freak.

01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:00.910
I know.

01:19:04.810 --> 01:19:05.840
Here comes Santa.

01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:07.010
Oh, really?

01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:09.120
Ho, ho, ho.
Oh, my God.

01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:10.480
Merry Christmas.

01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:14.280
Somebody's been
naughty this year.

01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:17.800
Boss?

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:20.160
Ned. Are you there? Hello?

01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:21.290
Hello?
Oh.

01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:23.960
Yes. Kevin, I'm here.
What's happening?

01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:25.090
I'm in.

01:19:25.290 --> 01:19:26.650
Do you have access
to the Internet?

01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:28.160
Yes, I do. Hold on.

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:29.600
Wait a second.

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:31.360
Log into your EarthLink account.

01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:33.450
Okay. Got it.

01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:36.640
I'm gonna send these
to you right now.

01:19:36.810 --> 01:19:38.760
Good.
You're done, Mayhew.

01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:41.320
What the fuck?

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:43.800
What happened?
Oh, my God.

01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:45.280
Wait, what?
What's going on?

01:19:45.450 --> 01:19:47.600
I don't know. He has my face.

01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:48.820
What do you mean
he has your face?

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:49.850
I'm locked out.

01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:51.320
I can't use my computer anymore.

01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:52.450
What?
Stop that!

01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:53.970
What's happening?
He's onto us, Ned.

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:55.010
What are you doing?

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:57.730
We have to abort.
Oh, God. Oh, no.

01:19:57.890 --> 01:20:01.040
Move back, motherfuckers
Mayhew's here

01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:02.170
Oh, fuck!

01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:03.410
He's a mythical creature, Ned.

01:20:03.490 --> 01:20:04.490
He's what?

01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:08.040
What the fuck? Oh, God.

01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:10.040
He's pulling out his penis!

01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:12.400
Oh, my God.

01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:14.480
He's balls deep
in my digital butt.

01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:18.180
Are you watching porn?

01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:19.320
Turn that off!

01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:20.550
Ned, he's doing it!

01:20:21.170 --> 01:20:22.520
Marnie, it's not good!

01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:24.520
Stay the fuck out!
Turn that off!

01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:25.720
Kevin!

01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:26.890
Kevin!

01:20:30.730 --> 01:20:32.200
He has control of the house!

01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:33.400
Come here!

01:20:33.610 --> 01:20:35.340
Kevin, what is happening?
We gotta get out of here!

01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:36.370
Go, go, go!

01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:37.570
- What?
- Kevin!

01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:39.040
Kevin!

01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:51.840
Oh, my...

01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:57.600
Silent night

01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:01.470
Holy night

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:05.640
All is calm

01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:09.470
All is bright

01:21:12.210 --> 01:21:13.430
Hi.
Hey.

01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:14.960
You know what?
Let's not fight.

01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:16.080
Okay.

01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:18.650
I'm sorry, truly, that you found out
about Stanford that way.

01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:19.730
Thank you.

01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:21.690
It was not okay of Laird,
and he knows that now.

01:21:21.850 --> 01:21:23.220
But I'm confident
this is a really good idea.

01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.900
Honey, before you continue,
I need to tell you something.

01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:27.560
Laird has been lying to you.

01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:29.130
I tried.

01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:30.720
No, no, no. Hey!
It's unbelievable!

01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:32.760
He is in serious
financial trouble.

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.720
In what way?
It's Christmas.

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.110
Ned, you're making a mistake.

01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:38.560
He doesn't have enough money
to finance his business,

01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:40.040
let alone a foundation.

01:21:40.130 --> 01:21:41.820
What exactly
makes you think that?

01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:43.160
Wait till you see this.

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:44.440
What's this?
Here.

01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:46.520
Look at this,
his own bank records.

01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:48.200
All in red.

01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:51.310
Is this for real?

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:52.550
Yeah, it's true.

01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:55.330
Guerrilla Gang hasn't crushed
one in a couple of years.

01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:57.040
So you lied to me?

01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:58.400
I'm dropping out of school

01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:00.930
to start a foundation that
you're supposed to be financing.

01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:02.070
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.320
Baby, the foundation
is all good.

01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:06.240
What are you talking about?

01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:09.760
Ned, there has been
a very big misunderstanding.

01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:12.880
These are only
Laird's business holdings.

01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:14.050
On the personal side...

01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:15.340
I have put together a moderate,

01:22:15.370 --> 01:22:17.200
conservative private
equity sleeve

01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:19.240
that has been
performing delightfully.

01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:21.000
You could say that again.
Mm-hmm.

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:22.560
So you followed
the Buffett rule?

01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:23.850
Always, dude.

01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:25.720
70/30, stocks to bonds.

01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:26.810
Buffet.

01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:27.930
Nice.

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:29.100
Your little hacker, Dingle...

01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:30.130
Hacker?

01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:31.960
...was worming down
the wrong hole.

01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:34.510
- Does he mean Kevin Dingle?
- Probably.

01:22:34.730 --> 01:22:36.040
No, must be another Dingle.

01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:38.640
Only dingle I know of
is the berries on the butt.

01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:40.600
Look, how much money
do you have?

01:22:40.730 --> 01:22:41.780
Babe, you don't
have to answer this.

01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:42.870
Yes, he does.

01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:44.760
Fine! Full disclosure.

01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:46.120
It's bad.

01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:50.040
I'm down to my last 97 million.

01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:51.880
Laird.

01:22:53.410 --> 01:22:55.240
197 million.

01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:57.840
Boom.

01:22:57.930 --> 01:23:00.120
He's just barely scraping by.

01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:01.450
All you had to do was ask me.

01:23:01.570 --> 01:23:03.600
Gentlemen, I need
Deck the Halls, allegro, now.

01:23:04.090 --> 01:23:06.840
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

01:23:07.050 --> 01:23:08.640
Ned, it's the holidays

01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:10.440
and I think
we should start over.

01:23:12.090 --> 01:23:13.150
So this is for you.

01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:18.290
What is it?

01:23:18.370 --> 01:23:19.570
It's a little stocking stuffer.

01:23:19.650 --> 01:23:20.710
I think you'll like it.

01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:24.120
A phone?
Press the button.

01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:28.880
This is from my bank
in Grand Rapids.

01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:30.160
Merry Christmas.

01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:31.380
Someone fill me in here.

01:23:31.410 --> 01:23:32.410
Well, Steph...

01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:35.040
I bought your father's company.

01:23:35.730 --> 01:23:36.760
Sort of.

01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:40.680
Ned, I purchased all your debt
as a Christmas present.

01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:42.160
What the fuck?

01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:44.480
You son of a bitch.
What?

01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:46.890
Dude, I'm trying to be nice,
so you can avoid bankruptcy.

01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:48.720
Are you guys talking Chapter 11?

01:23:48.810 --> 01:23:50.130
I don't even wanna
hear that term.

01:23:50.210 --> 01:23:52.920
Okay, gentlemen,
I need Jingle Bells, and step on it!

01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:56.280
I can't believe that
you didn't tell us about this.

01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:58.520
What? No, it's just...

01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:01.190
The business has been running
a little rough lately.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:03.060
I'm already working on
a new deal right now.

01:24:03.090 --> 01:24:05.000
So you had no idea?
No.

01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:06.610
How the hell
did you know about this?

01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:08.760
It was Justine.
Oh.

01:24:08.850 --> 01:24:10.040
Yeah, it was me.

01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:12.940
She played me back a little bit of a
conversation you had the other day...

01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:13.970
with a guy named Lou.

01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:16.600
Of course, I had to help.

01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:18.340
Ned, I'm sorry if I overstepped.

01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:19.370
Yep.

01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:21.480
But I was really,
really worried about you.

01:24:21.650 --> 01:24:23.240
She was.
No clowning.

01:24:23.410 --> 01:24:24.920
And just so you don't stress,

01:24:25.130 --> 01:24:27.430
you're still gonna be
the Big Cheese, dude.

01:24:27.610 --> 01:24:29.520
I plan on being
a very hands-off owner.

01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:33.070
So what do you say, partner?

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:37.290
- Ned, what are you...
- What the fuck?

01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:39.320
Why would you do that, Dad?

01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:40.410
Dad!

01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:41.880
Fuck you, paper man!

01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:44.920
Oh, scheisse.

01:24:45.090 --> 01:24:46.090
Ned, I'm sorry, bro.

01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:47.840
Are you okay? Oh, man.

01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:49.280
My training, it just takes over.

01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:51.680
Everybody is feeling
a lot of tension.

01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:52.910
Calm down.
Dad!

01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:56.360
Or we can hit people square
in the face with an iPad.

01:24:58.370 --> 01:25:00.040
Disengage.
Disengage and run!

01:25:03.650 --> 01:25:05.300
Dude, that was kind of cool.
You gotta be honest.

01:25:05.330 --> 01:25:07.200
Ned, I love you.
I was just trying to help.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:09.770
Ooh!

01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:12.530
Laird, disengage him!

01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:14.120
Ned, let go of his balls!

01:25:17.610 --> 01:25:19.320
Laird! Evasive parkour!

01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:20.550
Laird, get away!

01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:22.680
Evasive parkour!
Do the wall pop!

01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:24.530
Wall pop!

01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:29.720
Goose! Did you see that?

01:25:29.890 --> 01:25:32.600
That's right! Because you
finally engaged your core!

01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:33.770
Get down here!

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:36.660
You see the difference of the feeling?
How it feels differently?

01:25:36.690 --> 01:25:37.720
I know!

01:25:38.690 --> 01:25:39.800
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:25:40.410 --> 01:25:41.700
Don't breathe in.
I'll save you, brother!

01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:42.810
Scotty, no! Scotty!

01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:43.850
No, honey!

01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:45.890
I'm here to save you, Laird!

01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:51.630
Scotty, watch out!

01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:01.840
Laird! You okay?

01:26:03.010 --> 01:26:04.010
Yeah!

01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:05.440
Fantastic!
You're okay.

01:26:06.010 --> 01:26:07.640
You're okay.
Wait. Where's Scotty?

01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:09.080
Scotty! Oh, my God.

01:26:09.450 --> 01:26:11.320
Scotty!
He's under the moose!

01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:12.940
He's under the moose!

01:26:12.970 --> 01:26:14.110
Scotty!

01:26:16.210 --> 01:26:17.210
Oh, shit.

01:26:17.410 --> 01:26:19.640
These fucking moose balls
are in my mouth.

01:26:19.810 --> 01:26:21.840
Oh, shit,
he's teabagging you, bro!

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.320
I got you.

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:31.150
Come here. Come here.

01:26:31.330 --> 01:26:33.000
Oh, my God. It's okay.

01:26:33.170 --> 01:26:34.170
It's okay.

01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:39.950
Honey, I'm so sorry
it turned out this way.

01:26:40.130 --> 01:26:41.130
Me, too.

01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:42.970
I'll call you when I get home.

01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:45.080
Okay. Good luck with Scotty.

01:26:45.850 --> 01:26:47.320
Thank you. I'll need it.
Yeah.

01:26:49.410 --> 01:26:52.040
Steph, listen. I never...

01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:54.400
I'm done listening.
Have a safe flight.

01:26:57.850 --> 01:26:59.600
See you, sis.
Bye, Scotty.

01:27:01.530 --> 01:27:03.910
Can't believe I have to
go back to toilet paper.

01:27:10.650 --> 01:27:13.400
Hey, Don Millis.
Merry Christmas, sir.

01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:15.370
You too, Ned. Look, I hate
to call on Christmas.

01:27:15.490 --> 01:27:17.200
Oh, don't worry about that.

01:27:17.370 --> 01:27:19.120
It was great
catching up yesterday

01:27:19.290 --> 01:27:21.450
and I wanted to ring you
as soon as we made a decision.

01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:22.530
Okay.

01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:24.490
I talked with the group here
about your proposal

01:27:24.570 --> 01:27:26.160
and we just can't go for it.

01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:27.600
I'm sorry, pal.

01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:30.480
We really appreciate you offering
us such a sweetheart deal.

01:27:30.690 --> 01:27:33.260
But fact is we 're just not doing a
whole lot of printing these days.

01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:34.430
You know how it is.
Yes.

01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:35.740
It's a whole new world, right?

01:27:35.770 --> 01:27:36.770
Yes.

01:27:37.690 --> 01:27:38.720
Sure is.

01:27:38.890 --> 01:27:40.690
I sure wish we could've
done business, Cheese.

01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:42.120
All right, listen, um,

01:27:42.330 --> 01:27:44.680
if you're sure I can't
change your mind there, Don.

01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:46.070
Yeah, unfortunately not.

01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:47.960
Okay. All right.

01:27:49.090 --> 01:27:51.200
You have a happy holidays.
You, too, Ned!

01:27:51.370 --> 01:27:52.760
Best to Barb and the kids.

01:27:55.810 --> 01:27:57.200
Excuse me, Ned?

01:27:57.370 --> 01:28:00.320
I'm sorry to bother you,
but your flight leaves in an hour.

01:28:03.210 --> 01:28:06.640
Must seem strange
to you, my friend

01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:08.200
I'll miss you.

01:28:08.290 --> 01:28:11.600
Some things are always
heaven sent

01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:16.150
The more you want,
the harder it gets

01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:20.840
The more you let go,
the more you get

01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:22.400
It's a crazy...

01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:30.000
...beautiful life

01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:34.760
Some things make sense
and you don't know what

01:28:34.890 --> 01:28:39.360
It's a crazy beautiful life

01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:48.280
Welcome home, Flemings!

01:28:48.450 --> 01:28:49.560
Lou, what...

01:28:49.690 --> 01:28:50.750
You guys must be freezing.

01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:53.120
Come on, get in here.
Let me get that. Come on, Cheese.

01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:54.570
Lou, what's going on?
Barbara, hey.

01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:55.800
Hi.

01:28:55.890 --> 01:28:56.980
- Barb, you look great.
- There they are!

01:28:57.010 --> 01:28:59.470
Merry Christmas!

01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:02.870
Wow!

01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:06.800
Um, Lou, I texted you that
I needed to talk to you.

01:29:06.970 --> 01:29:07.970
I mean, what's...

01:29:08.130 --> 01:29:10.120
Come on, you hear this guy?

01:29:10.330 --> 01:29:11.720
Hank Rouse from First National

01:29:11.890 --> 01:29:14.270
shot me a congratulatory
voicemail this morning

01:29:14.410 --> 01:29:15.800
about the Mayhew deal.

01:29:15.970 --> 01:29:16.970
You did it, Big Cheese!

01:29:18.570 --> 01:29:20.010
You pulled off
the Christmas miracle.

01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:24.120
Cheese, Cheese, Cheese!
Cheese, Cheese, Cheese!

01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:25.400
Barb!

01:29:26.410 --> 01:29:27.410
Scotty.

01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:30.280
Ned, as a little token
of our appreciation,

01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:32.910
we all chipped in
and bought you something

01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:35.720
that we're pretty sure
you don't own.

01:29:38.170 --> 01:29:39.840
You shouldn't have.

01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:41.520
Open it. Yeah.

01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:43.250
Yeah, right there.

01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:46.760
It's an iPad.

01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:49.280
Hit the home button right there.

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:50.450
Yeah.

01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:53.820
We had a little fun
with that down in Graphics.

01:29:53.850 --> 01:29:56.000
I got the images off
Scotty's Facebook page.

01:29:57.970 --> 01:29:59.680
He looks like a stand-up guy.

01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:01.520
Like a younger version
of you, Ned.

01:30:02.290 --> 01:30:03.320
Make a speech!

01:30:03.450 --> 01:30:04.760
Speech!
Oh, yes, speech!

01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:06.280
Speech, speech, speech.

01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:13.040
The heck is that?

01:30:17.210 --> 01:30:19.480
Laird, a jet and
a helicopter? Where are we?

01:30:19.690 --> 01:30:21.160
Hang on, babe. Almost there.

01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:34.320
One second.
Mayhew!

01:30:34.490 --> 01:30:35.500
Guys, stay here for a minute.

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:36.660
Honey, go inside
and get a jacket.

01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:37.860
That's Mayhew.
Is that the guy?

01:30:37.890 --> 01:30:38.890
Laird!

01:30:38.970 --> 01:30:40.160
Where are we?

01:30:40.330 --> 01:30:41.330
That looks weird.

01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:42.890
It's kind of Fifty
Shades of Grey-ish.

01:30:43.090 --> 01:30:44.680
Cold?
Yeah.

01:30:47.010 --> 01:30:49.470
And here we go.

01:30:51.370 --> 01:30:52.560
Surprise!

01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:54.640
Hi, honey.

01:30:56.050 --> 01:30:57.160
Ta-da.

01:30:59.690 --> 01:31:01.240
You brought me home?
Yeah.

01:31:01.410 --> 01:31:03.040
Without telling me?

01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:06.520
I realize I violated the
sanctity of mystery date

01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:09.560
but I just thought the family
should all be together today.

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.490
Okay, that wasn't your
place to do that, hon.

01:31:11.610 --> 01:31:13.440
Steph, I know,

01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:15.000
but it is Christmas.

01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:16.240
And we're glad to see you.

01:31:16.410 --> 01:31:17.470
This isn't what she wanted.

01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:18.630
No, it's not.

01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:20.280
What I wanted was
for us to spend

01:31:20.370 --> 01:31:21.760
Christmas in California together

01:31:21.930 --> 01:31:24.360
like I planned, before
everything went to shit

01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:26.280
because you made it
all about yourself.

01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:28.430
Mm-hmm.

01:31:29.130 --> 01:31:30.350
You both did.

01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:31.720
I did?
Yes!

01:31:31.930 --> 01:31:34.880
You idiots think you can
pass me back and forth

01:31:35.050 --> 01:31:36.880
like I'm your property
or something?

01:31:36.970 --> 01:31:37.970
I'm done.

01:31:38.050 --> 01:31:39.520
This is the worst
Christmas ever.

01:31:39.730 --> 01:31:41.400
Steph.
Steph. Honey.

01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:47.560
I think she's pissed.

01:31:50.490 --> 01:31:52.320
Yeah, she's pissed.

01:31:52.450 --> 01:31:53.450
Shit!

01:31:53.730 --> 01:31:57.720
I just thought that you guys
should be together today.

01:31:58.970 --> 01:32:01.320
All right.
Well, I'll leave you to it.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.600
Happy holidays, Ned.

01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:05.080
You too, Laird.

01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:13.720
Uh, Laird.

01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:15.920
You're doing a "I'm
gonna walk away slowly

01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:17.610
"'cause I really don't
wanna leave" walk.

01:32:19.810 --> 01:32:21.160
Maybe.

01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:22.610
Come here.

01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:24.910
Come here.

01:32:25.090 --> 01:32:26.960
So what happened?
You didn't propose?

01:32:27.130 --> 01:32:28.240
How could I?

01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:29.490
I never got your permission

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:31.440
and we pinky-swore
I wouldn't ask without it.

01:32:33.690 --> 01:32:35.320
You are remarkable.

01:32:36.490 --> 01:32:39.840
You don't have a gear
to be dishonest, do you?

01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:42.000
Guess not, dude.

01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:46.680
Laird, you never needed
my permission

01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:48.160
to ask Stephanie to marry you.

01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:52.000
But if it still means
anything to you,

01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:54.510
you have my blessing.

01:32:57.290 --> 01:32:58.320
For reals?

01:32:58.890 --> 01:32:59.890
No clowning.

01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:02.490
Whoa.

01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:06.670
But, Laird, Stephanie's right.

01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:09.120
It's up to her.
It's always been up to her.

01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:10.270
Not us.

01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:14.210
It just took me a while
to realize that.

01:33:15.650 --> 01:33:16.680
It's so true.

01:33:17.650 --> 01:33:19.120
Dude, we were such jerks.

01:33:19.330 --> 01:33:20.470
Yeah.

01:33:20.650 --> 01:33:21.840
I bit your dick.

01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:24.640
Shaft and balls.
Oh.

01:33:26.410 --> 01:33:27.630
I'm sorry.

01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:29.880
I'm sorry, too, dude.

01:33:30.090 --> 01:33:33.160
Look, Laird, if you wanna
ask Stephanie to marry you

01:33:33.330 --> 01:33:35.360
when the time
is right, just do it.

01:33:36.930 --> 01:33:39.000
Okay. Is it cool
if I do it right now?

01:33:39.170 --> 01:33:41.400
Because, uh, just in case
it worked out

01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:44.680
I had Goose put a shit ton
of doves in the helicopter

01:33:44.850 --> 01:33:46.250
and I have
a couple other surprises.

01:33:46.410 --> 01:33:48.840
Laird, this is
totally your call.

01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:51.000
But can I give you some advice?

01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:52.590
Dude, please.

01:33:52.690 --> 01:33:53.740
I'm so fucking
nervous right now.

01:33:53.770 --> 01:33:54.800
All right, look...

01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:58.160
Stephanie doesn't care about
all the bells and whistles.

01:33:58.370 --> 01:33:59.920
You know her.

01:34:00.090 --> 01:34:01.520
She cares about you.

01:34:01.690 --> 01:34:03.040
She loves you.

01:34:04.530 --> 01:34:06.400
So you get down on one knee

01:34:07.290 --> 01:34:09.670
and you speak to her
from your heart.

01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:12.200
That's what you're best at.

01:34:14.130 --> 01:34:16.360
Isn't that right, Justine?

01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:18.360
Totally agree.

01:34:18.930 --> 01:34:19.930
Holy shit.

01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:23.200
My first time in Michigan.
It's cold as balls here.

01:34:24.370 --> 01:34:25.370
Yeah.

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:27.760
Dude, that's fucking great!

01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:29.710
Do it Ned Fleming style.

01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:31.440
Old school!

01:34:31.650 --> 01:34:32.710
Fuck yes.

01:34:35.050 --> 01:34:36.600
Okay. Well, look...

01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:38.780
I'll go in there and see if
I can get her to come out.

01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:39.810
Okay.

01:34:39.930 --> 01:34:41.600
Good luck.
Thanks.

01:34:45.090 --> 01:34:47.120
Hey, promise me one thing.

01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:49.920
You will treat her well.

01:34:51.490 --> 01:34:54.440
Dude, I'm gonna treat her
like a motherfucking queen.

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:57.480
I'll take that.

01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:58.650
Okay.

01:35:00.610 --> 01:35:02.760
Gustav, change of plans.

01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:05.520
We're go on the proposal.
No go on all that other shit.

01:35:05.610 --> 01:35:06.610
I have only one bar.

01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:08.160
You're saying we are a go, yes?

01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:09.920
No. No go.

01:35:10.090 --> 01:35:12.080
Go on the proposal,
no go on the shit.

01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:14.160
Laird, are you saying
it's a no go

01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:16.440
or are you saying, "No. Go."?

01:35:16.530 --> 01:35:17.590
God damn it, Goose.

01:35:17.850 --> 01:35:19.620
You're making me fucking
nervous. Just shut up.

01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:21.240
Oh, I'm sorry. Good luck.

01:35:21.450 --> 01:35:23.750
Oh, and by the way,
please, Laird, breathe.

01:35:26.690 --> 01:35:27.720
Okay.

01:35:27.810 --> 01:35:29.800
And no cursing, okay?

01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:31.480
Fuck, you're right. Good call.

01:35:33.610 --> 01:35:34.720
Hi.

01:35:37.770 --> 01:35:39.120
I'm sorry.

01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:43.280
I know that out in California
I disappointed you

01:35:43.450 --> 01:35:45.320
and that kills me.

01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:47.120
And I'm really sorry.

01:35:50.650 --> 01:35:51.650
I'm sorry, too.

01:35:53.690 --> 01:35:54.940
I threw you in the
deep end out there.

01:35:54.970 --> 01:35:56.370
I should've never
asked you to come.

01:35:56.490 --> 01:35:57.490
Honestly. No.

01:35:57.650 --> 01:35:59.040
No, you didn't do
anything wrong.

01:35:59.210 --> 01:36:00.350
What was I thinking?

01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:01.640
It was me.

01:36:02.650 --> 01:36:05.030
It's just that, when we
got out to Laird's...

01:36:06.570 --> 01:36:09.360
I just didn't feel like
I knew you anymore

01:36:10.330 --> 01:36:12.000
and I got scared.

01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:15.480
I just went crazy.

01:36:18.210 --> 01:36:19.480
This is me.

01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:23.360
I'm doing good.

01:36:25.050 --> 01:36:26.360
Oh, Dad.

01:36:32.610 --> 01:36:33.610
Oh, my God.

01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:35.160
Okay, look. I forgot...

01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:36.380
Oh, God.
He's still out there.

01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:37.470
I know.

01:36:37.570 --> 01:36:38.820
In a tank top and a scarf.

01:36:38.850 --> 01:36:40.060
And he knew
we were coming to Michigan.

01:36:40.090 --> 01:36:41.090
Yeah.

01:36:41.250 --> 01:36:42.490
Why doesn't he just come inside?

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:43.860
He has to talk to you
about something...

01:36:43.890 --> 01:36:46.400
He kind of wants to make
things right with you.

01:36:46.570 --> 01:36:48.000
Oh, does he?
Yeah.

01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:51.240
I think it'd be cool
if you gave him a chance.

01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:55.510
You want me
to give Laird a chance?

01:36:55.690 --> 01:36:59.440
I thought that if you saw
fit to give him a chance...

01:36:59.610 --> 01:37:02.240
I thought that it'd be cool.

01:37:04.690 --> 01:37:05.690
That's all. Well?

01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:07.400
Hi.
Hey.

01:37:07.570 --> 01:37:09.520
What's going on?
Oh, my God, it's cold out here.

01:37:09.730 --> 01:37:11.880
I know you're pissed,
but just hear me out.

01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:13.440
Can we talk inside?
No.

01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:14.610
Oh, my...
Look.

01:37:14.730 --> 01:37:17.360
Oh, my God.
It's so romantic.

01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:18.760
I told him to keep it simple.

01:37:18.930 --> 01:37:20.120
Oh, our little girl.

01:37:20.290 --> 01:37:22.420
He's gonna get down to his
knee and keep it real simple.

01:37:22.450 --> 01:37:23.720
How do you know all this?

01:37:23.890 --> 01:37:25.030
I gave him a few pointers.

01:37:25.210 --> 01:37:26.430
Oh.

01:37:27.610 --> 01:37:29.440
This has been the
happiest year of my life.

01:37:31.410 --> 01:37:34.560
And fly! Go, go, go! Go!

01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:38.240
Oh, no.
What?

01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:41.570
Ah.

01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:44.920
Oh, my God.

01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:47.120
Goose. God damn it.
I said no go! No go!

01:37:47.290 --> 01:37:48.320
Oh, my...

01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:49.440
Oh, gosh. Wow.

01:37:49.570 --> 01:37:50.620
Why did he do that?
Smart boy.

01:37:50.650 --> 01:37:52.680
Absolute fucking shit fest.

01:37:53.690 --> 01:37:55.400
Babe, I'm so
sorry. Uh...

01:37:58.650 --> 01:38:00.120
Stephanie Fleming...

01:38:00.650 --> 01:38:02.000
will you...
Are you proposing?

01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:03.960
Yeah.

01:38:04.090 --> 01:38:05.800
Mmm-hmm.

01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:07.240
Did my dad know about this?

01:38:07.810 --> 01:38:09.560
Yeah, I asked for his blessing

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:11.080
that first morning back in Cali.

01:38:11.290 --> 01:38:13.320
Oh, my God.

01:38:13.650 --> 01:38:14.760
Oh, my God!

01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:17.440
No wonder he acted
so crazy. Honey.

01:38:17.610 --> 01:38:19.520
Yeah, that's why he was
a little out of whack.

01:38:19.690 --> 01:38:21.760
Yeah, we could have had
a really nice holiday.

01:38:21.970 --> 01:38:24.640
I know. But we're all
good now. Okay?

01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:26.960
This is a lot.

01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:29.840
Oh, my God.
Stephanie Fleming...

01:38:30.010 --> 01:38:31.410
That's a ring.

01:38:32.530 --> 01:38:34.320
Goose! No!

01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:40.960
And, go! Go, guys!
Go, go, go!

01:38:41.850 --> 01:38:43.120
Stephanie!

01:38:44.530 --> 01:38:45.530
Oh, my God.

01:38:57.490 --> 01:39:00.800
Laird, what is Kiss doing here?

01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:02.790
Um, well...

01:39:05.010 --> 01:39:06.040
Is that...
Whoa!

01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:07.360
He got look-a-likes!

01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:09.480
Those aren't
look-a-likes, Ned.

01:39:09.570 --> 01:39:10.840
That's Gene and Paul.

01:39:11.010 --> 01:39:14.000
It's Gene and Paul!
Gene and Paul!

01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:16.200
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:17.760
Kiss is in the front yard!

01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:20.390
Tonight

01:39:20.610 --> 01:39:22.990
I wanna give it all to you

01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:25.890
In the darkness

01:39:26.050 --> 01:39:28.720
Originally, I had this more
elaborate proposal plan

01:39:28.890 --> 01:39:30.560
but your dad gave me
this awesome advice

01:39:30.690 --> 01:39:31.830
and told me not to do it.

01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:33.400
But they're here,

01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:35.400
and I know how much
you love their music, so...

01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:36.840
What? Hi.

01:39:37.010 --> 01:39:40.760
I was made for lovin' you, baby

01:39:40.930 --> 01:39:44.680
You were made for lovin' me

01:39:44.850 --> 01:39:46.680
And I can't get...

01:39:50.210 --> 01:39:52.080
Is he still proposing?
What's...

01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:53.680
They've stopped playing now.

01:39:53.890 --> 01:39:55.800
- His name's Ned.
- Oh, my God, are they...

01:39:55.930 --> 01:39:56.930
What?

01:39:57.050 --> 01:39:58.060
Are they coming in the...
Oh, my God.

01:39:58.090 --> 01:39:59.180
They're coming up the sidewalk!

01:39:59.210 --> 01:40:00.210
They're heading in!

01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:01.850
They're coming in our house!
Oh, my God!

01:40:01.890 --> 01:40:03.800
Everybody act natural!
Act naturally!

01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:05.190
I have to redecorate the house!

01:40:16.650 --> 01:40:17.710
Hey.

01:40:17.890 --> 01:40:18.890
Hi.

01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:20.080
Hi.

01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:23.390
Uh, hi.

01:40:24.570 --> 01:40:26.080
- I'm Ned.
- Hey, Ned.

01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:27.390
Hi!
Hi!

01:40:27.570 --> 01:40:29.160
This is my wife, Barb.

01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:30.720
This is our friends,
Lou and Patty.

01:40:30.810 --> 01:40:31.950
It's Lou.

01:40:32.130 --> 01:40:33.560
So excited you're here.

01:40:33.730 --> 01:40:37.000
I gotta tell you.
Uh, we are huge fans.

01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:40.840
We've been members of the Kiss
Army for, like, 30 years now.

01:40:41.010 --> 01:40:43.640
Yeah. Our first date was
the Crazy Nights Tour.

01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:46.240
Yeah! And, boy,
was that crazy.

01:40:46.330 --> 01:40:47.390
Crazy.

01:40:48.130 --> 01:40:49.130
Did you get laid?

01:40:52.450 --> 01:40:53.450
Um...

01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:56.280
I gave him a handjob.

01:40:57.330 --> 01:40:58.840
Scotty.

01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:00.960
I'm having an awesome time,

01:41:01.090 --> 01:41:02.440
but are you having
a buffet here?

01:41:02.610 --> 01:41:04.160
Oh, my God.
What was I thinking?

01:41:04.330 --> 01:41:05.760
Are you hungry?
Starving.

01:41:05.930 --> 01:41:07.680
Oh, God, of course!
Where's our manners?

01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:08.800
We're terrible hosts.

01:41:08.970 --> 01:41:10.100
Let's get those guitars, guys.

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:11.320
Come on, let me get that axe.

01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:13.670
See my body?

01:41:13.770 --> 01:41:14.770
Wow! Kiss is
in our house!

01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:18.000
Yeah. I'm kind of
juiced up a little bit.

01:41:18.450 --> 01:41:20.320
Oh! I almost forgot
about them.

01:41:20.490 --> 01:41:22.320
Well...
The happy couple.

01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:23.960
Congratulations.

01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:25.800
She said no.

01:41:26.690 --> 01:41:27.690
I'm sorry, what?

01:41:27.850 --> 01:41:29.120
She said no.

01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:32.010
Well...

01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:34.830
Honey.

01:41:35.490 --> 01:41:37.120
I'm so flattered

01:41:37.330 --> 01:41:39.320
that you wanna marry me

01:41:39.810 --> 01:41:40.850
but I'm not ready for that.

01:41:44.370 --> 01:41:45.680
And I'm gonna finish school.

01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:47.160
For me.

01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:48.800
Because that's what I wanna do.

01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:50.480
Got it?

01:41:50.650 --> 01:41:52.320
That's really smart.

01:41:52.490 --> 01:41:55.240
It's just, I had this big plan

01:41:56.370 --> 01:41:57.640
and it didn't work out.

01:41:58.490 --> 01:42:00.560
Yeah.
Well, that's life, pal.

01:42:02.530 --> 01:42:05.200
That is so well put, Ned.

01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:07.680
It's really, really smart.

01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:09.520
Dude, did you come up with that?

01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:11.320
The words, "That's life?"

01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:14.160
Ned, you're so full of
practical wisdom...

01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:16.140
I was just really
looking forward

01:42:16.170 --> 01:42:17.390
to you being
my father-in-law.

01:42:17.610 --> 01:42:18.610
Aw.

01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:21.600
I'm not breaking up with you.

01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:22.770
You're not?

01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:23.890
No, honey.

01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:25.530
No, no, no.
I'm still your girlfriend.

01:42:25.610 --> 01:42:27.320
We're still together.

01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:28.410
Oh.

01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:31.040
Oh, thank God!

01:42:31.210 --> 01:42:32.240
Come here.

01:42:43.210 --> 01:42:44.350
Merry Christmas.

01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:45.530
Ned.
Hey.

01:42:45.650 --> 01:42:47.200
Dude, your employees
are so cool.

01:42:47.370 --> 01:42:48.640
Yeah, they are.

01:42:48.810 --> 01:42:50.960
Maybe it was wrong of me
to interfere like that,

01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:52.920
but why don't you
let me save your company?

01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:56.040
No, Laird, I can't.

01:42:56.210 --> 01:42:58.200
That old model
doesn't work anymore.

01:42:58.410 --> 01:43:00.240
I guess...
I don't know.

01:43:00.450 --> 01:43:02.240
I guess I just didn't
want to believe it.

01:43:03.090 --> 01:43:04.720
But since you mentioned it...

01:43:04.890 --> 01:43:07.040
I do have a business idea
I wanna run by you.

01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:08.760
Dude, elevator pitch me!

01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:10.120
Okay.

01:43:11.490 --> 01:43:12.760
No, hold on.

01:43:12.930 --> 01:43:15.280
This wasn't my idea at all.
One second.

01:43:15.450 --> 01:43:17.200
- Scotty, come here.
- Yo, what's up?

01:43:17.290 --> 01:43:18.290
Come here.
Yeah?

01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:19.900
I want you to tell Laird
about the business idea

01:43:19.930 --> 01:43:21.320
you mentioned on the plane.

01:43:21.490 --> 01:43:22.490
Go ahead.
Wait, really?

01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:23.570
Yeah.

01:43:23.650 --> 01:43:25.370
Told you to get that seat
at the table, bro.

01:43:25.410 --> 01:43:27.010
You did. He told me,
Dad. He was, like...

01:43:27.130 --> 01:43:28.220
"You're gonna
get that seat."

01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:29.660
I can't believe
I finally got the seat.

01:43:29.690 --> 01:43:30.910
Dragons and titties, baby.

01:43:31.090 --> 01:43:32.920
Dragons and titties!

01:43:33.170 --> 01:43:34.570
Breathe that fire.

01:43:34.690 --> 01:43:35.690
Get up in there.

01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:38.480
Get up in those titties!

01:43:38.650 --> 01:43:39.970
Gonna get those dragons.

01:43:40.770 --> 01:43:41.910
Dad...

01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:43.760
Scotty!

01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:46.490
Stop motorboating your dad,
and elevator pitch me.

01:43:46.610 --> 01:43:48.080
Sorry. Uh...

01:43:48.450 --> 01:43:51.280
Laird, I can't stop thinking
about your toilets, dude.

01:43:51.450 --> 01:43:53.120
My toilets?
Yeah.

01:43:53.290 --> 01:43:54.920
The fresh feeling,
the scented talc.

01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:57.280
I was thinking if you can
get the controls in English

01:43:57.450 --> 01:43:59.210
and maybe lower the price
point a little bit,

01:43:59.290 --> 01:44:00.420
we could have
a potentially untapped

01:44:00.450 --> 01:44:01.450
market here in America.

01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:03.120
Oh, shit.
Right?

01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:04.940
And look, we can contact
a Japanese manufacturer

01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:06.000
about pricing...
Ooh.

01:44:06.170 --> 01:44:08.520
No, Scotty. Pardon my French,
but fuck that noise.

01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:10.160
Whoa.

01:44:10.290 --> 01:44:13.280
Listen. We have a factory
right here in Grand Rapids

01:44:13.450 --> 01:44:15.640
with 37 of the best employees
you're ever gonna want.

01:44:15.810 --> 01:44:17.720
Let's build our own.

01:44:18.810 --> 01:44:20.720
Hells yes, Grateful Ned!
Yeah!

01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:22.200
Boom!

01:44:24.370 --> 01:44:25.480
Okay, sorry. Yeah.

01:44:30.010 --> 01:44:35.840
The first noel
the angels did say

01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:41.360
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

01:44:41.530 --> 01:44:47.080
In fields where they lay
keeping their sheep

01:44:47.250 --> 01:44:52.760
On a cold winter's night
that was so deep

01:44:52.930 --> 01:44:54.480
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

01:44:54.690 --> 01:44:57.520
It turned out to be a pretty
cool holiday after all, huh?

01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:59.510
It did, son.

01:45:01.450 --> 01:45:02.450
Dude.

01:45:03.010 --> 01:45:04.010
What?

01:45:04.090 --> 01:45:05.970
Told you you'd be
calling me "son" by Christmas.

01:45:06.010 --> 01:45:07.800
Oh.

01:45:07.890 --> 01:45:09.680
That's just a figure of speech.

01:45:09.850 --> 01:45:10.880
Sure, Dad.

01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:25.450
Merry Christmas,
I don't want to fight tonight

01:45:31.530 --> 01:45:34.200
Hello there, you gang!
It is I, Gustav.

01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:36.640
It's so great to see you!

01:45:36.810 --> 01:45:39.370
Hey, what do you think
of the new facial hair, huh?

01:45:39.570 --> 01:45:41.360
I'm based in Michigan now,
so you know...

01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:42.780
I'm trying to do this
whole kind of

01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:44.120
Paul Bunyan, Midwestern thing.

01:45:44.290 --> 01:45:45.410
I wanted to fill it all out.

01:45:46.090 --> 01:45:49.040
So Scotty, Laird, and Ned
took the printing company...

01:45:49.290 --> 01:45:50.420
turned it into
a toilet factory...

01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:51.920
and it's going great!

01:45:52.090 --> 01:45:54.960
The toilet is water efficient
und eco-friendly.

01:45:55.050 --> 01:45:56.440
It's state of the art.

01:45:56.610 --> 01:45:59.720
I'm telling you, they have
invented the Tesla of toilets!

01:46:00.210 --> 01:46:01.430
It's amazing.

01:46:01.610 --> 01:46:03.280
Barbara has made sure
that each toilet

01:46:03.370 --> 01:46:05.080
has a state of the art
vaginal cleanse.

01:46:05.530 --> 01:46:09.840
You know
exactly what I'm saying.

01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:11.560
Every single model
comes with Justine.

01:46:11.730 --> 01:46:12.770
Talk about a smart toilet.

01:46:12.930 --> 01:46:14.140
She knows
if you need a little sploosh

01:46:14.170 --> 01:46:15.170
or if you actually need

01:46:15.250 --> 01:46:16.770
the fountains
of the Bellagio up there.

01:46:18.570 --> 01:46:21.000
Scotty has finally
got his seat at the table.

01:46:21.650 --> 01:46:22.680
It's beautiful.

01:46:22.930 --> 01:46:24.640
He went a little too far
with the dragons,

01:46:24.730 --> 01:46:26.210
and the titties,
and the motorboating.

01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:28.770
Oy vey.

01:46:29.530 --> 01:46:30.590
Oh, Miss Stephanie.

01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:33.270
She had the idea to link
the Fleming-Mayhew company

01:46:33.450 --> 01:46:35.240
with the new foundation.

01:46:35.370 --> 01:46:37.600
So now, they're sponsoring
sewage projects

01:46:37.770 --> 01:46:39.880
all over the Third World.
I told you.

01:46:39.970 --> 01:46:42.400
Smart, smart, smart girl.

01:46:42.970 --> 01:46:45.800
So, things are working out
really well for the gang here.

01:46:46.210 --> 01:46:47.680
The company is
a smashing success.

01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:49.840
And my dear Laird

01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:52.440
has finally gotten
what he's always wanted.

01:46:52.890 --> 01:46:54.160
To be part of a family.

01:46:57.610 --> 01:46:59.320
All right, ciao for now,
you friends.

01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:00.550
Until we meet again.

01:47:00.730 --> 01:47:02.740
Laird, it doesn't count as
a sneak attack if I can see...

01:47:02.770 --> 01:47:04.520
Fuck you, Goose!
Scheisse!

01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:11.800
I wanna rock and roll all night

01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:14.880
And party every day

01:47:15.250 --> 01:47:18.600
I wanna rock and roll all night

01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:21.560
And party every day

01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:27.720
You keep on saying
you'll be mine for a while

01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:31.360
You're looking fancy
and I like your style

01:47:31.890 --> 01:47:36.160
You drive us wild,
we'll drive you crazy

01:47:39.250 --> 01:47:41.960
You show us
everything you've got

01:47:42.370 --> 01:47:44.960
Baby, baby, it's quite a lot

01:47:45.690 --> 01:47:50.160
You drive us wild,
we 'll drive you crazy

01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:55.600
You keep on shouting,
you keep on shouting

01:47:58.730 --> 01:48:03.200
I wanna rock and roll all night

01:48:04.290 --> 01:48:06.080
And party every day

01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:10.030
I wanna rock and roll all night

01:48:11.290 --> 01:48:13.080
And party every day

01:48:13.210 --> 01:48:16.960
I wanna rock and roll all night

01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:19.720
And party every day

01:48:19.850 --> 01:48:23.390
I wanna rock and roll all night

01:48:24.610 --> 01:48:26.360
And party every day
