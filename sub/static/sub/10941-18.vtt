WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.901
Maybe we should just elope.

00:01.968 --> 00:03.235
Good idea.

00:03.303 --> 00:04.703
Over my dead body.

00:04.771 --> 00:06.671
Look, you think
your first wedding was great?

00:06.739 --> 00:08.540
You just wait
until you see ours.

00:08.608 --> 00:10.609
Nice looking little
friend you got there.

00:10.676 --> 00:11.742
Miracle girl?

00:11.810 --> 00:12.878
We'll see about that.

00:12.945 --> 00:15.213
<i>The winner is...
Amy Fleming!</i>

00:15.280 --> 00:16.481
I'm in love with you.

00:16.549 --> 00:17.682
How is that a problem?

00:17.900 --> 00:19.600
Eventually you're gonna
break my heart.

00:19.669 --> 00:21.435
I'm just gonna save us
both the trouble

00:21.503 --> 00:22.937
and break my own heart.

00:23.005 --> 00:24.773
I did propose to Lisa.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.007
You guys just take one
of the most important moments

00:26.075 --> 00:27.007
of my life

00:27.075 --> 00:28.175
and hijack it from me?!

00:28.242 --> 00:30.110
We didn't wanna steal
your thunder...

00:30.178 --> 00:32.079
So no, we're not
getting married.

00:32.147 --> 00:33.213
Oh...

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:57.504 --> 00:59.805
Jack, pick a card. Any card.

00:59.872 --> 01:00.872
No.

01:00.940 --> 01:02.507
Oh, come on! It's awesome.

01:02.575 --> 01:03.508
I said, no.

01:03.576 --> 01:05.077
Why? Are you scared?

01:05.144 --> 01:08.246
No. I don't care to know
the future.

01:08.314 --> 01:09.848
The here and now's
enough to deal with;

01:09.916 --> 01:13.284
I can barely stand to read
the newspaper these days.

01:13.352 --> 01:15.452
Ty! Pick a card.

01:15.520 --> 01:18.522
<i>Concentrate on what you want
the card to tell you.</i>

01:18.590 --> 01:20.357
It's a ship.

01:20.425 --> 01:22.226
<i>The ship.
Very interesting.</i>

01:22.293 --> 01:23.627
It's all about travelling.

01:23.695 --> 01:25.329
You're supposed to take action
of some sort.

01:25.396 --> 01:27.297
Do something that
you've put off.

01:27.365 --> 01:30.701
Like all the chores
I've been bugging you to do.

01:30.768 --> 01:32.268
<i>It could also have
a negative aspect...</i>

01:32.336 --> 01:33.636
As in a sinking ship.

01:33.704 --> 01:36.005
<i>Oh. Thanks, Mallory.</i>

01:36.941 --> 01:38.608
Lou, pick a card.

01:38.675 --> 01:40.576
Um... hmm.

01:41.511 --> 01:42.645
<i>Good one. Clover.</i>

01:42.713 --> 01:43.847
It means potential happiness.

01:43.914 --> 01:45.148
Great.

01:45.216 --> 01:46.449
But since you picked it
with your left hand -

01:46.516 --> 01:48.450
which is weird since
you're right-handed -

01:48.517 --> 01:52.020
the happiness is clouded by
a big fat misunderstanding.

01:52.088 --> 01:53.688
Great. Okay.

01:53.757 --> 01:55.858
I have to go and meet Peter.

01:55.925 --> 01:58.393
I think I've actually found
our dream home,

01:58.461 --> 02:00.863
<i>and Peter's meeting me there
to look at it.</i>

02:00.930 --> 02:02.830
Hey, uh, can I take
your fancy new truck?

02:02.898 --> 02:05.166
Uh... no.
I'm not quite ready to share it.

02:06.869 --> 02:08.301
Keys are on the table.

02:08.370 --> 02:09.436
Thank you.

02:10.604 --> 02:11.672
Pick one.

02:14.943 --> 02:16.377
This one.

02:16.444 --> 02:17.812
<i>The road card.</i>

02:17.880 --> 02:18.879
That means there's a journey
ahead of you.

02:18.946 --> 02:20.180
How mysterious.

02:20.248 --> 02:22.649
But it could also mean
a fork in the road,

02:22.716 --> 02:24.584
- where you...
- Might have to make some big decision?

02:24.652 --> 02:26.119
How'd you know?

02:26.187 --> 02:27.520
Just a wild guess.

02:31.292 --> 02:33.693
Hey, Ty, check this out.

02:34.628 --> 02:36.262
Maybe Mallory's cards do work.

02:36.329 --> 02:38.697
It's an invitation
to the "Ring of Fire" tour.

02:38.765 --> 02:40.166
No way.

02:40.233 --> 02:42.134
It says I eligible since
I won the last competition.

02:42.202 --> 02:43.969
You're not thinking about
doing that again, are you?

02:44.037 --> 02:45.905
I don't know. Uh...

02:45.972 --> 02:48.607
I mean, the last one was
a pretty intense three days,

02:48.675 --> 02:50.642
a little over-the-top
competitive, but...

02:50.710 --> 02:52.376
Yeah. Like you don't have
a competitive bone

02:52.444 --> 02:53.144
in your body.

02:53.212 --> 02:54.145
Ty... what?

02:54.213 --> 02:55.646
When is it?

02:55.714 --> 02:57.648
It's over the
winter school break.

02:57.716 --> 03:00.451
Look at these cities
it's touring.

03:00.519 --> 03:02.620
Hey, you got the ship card,
right?

03:02.688 --> 03:04.488
And I got the road card.

03:04.556 --> 03:05.690
They're both about travelling.

03:05.757 --> 03:06.691
Maybe this means that
you and I should

03:06.758 --> 03:08.758
get in that big truck of mine,

03:08.827 --> 03:09.893
go on the tour together.

03:09.961 --> 03:11.394
Yeah, that could be cool.

03:11.462 --> 03:12.896
Are you kidding?!
This would be amazing!

03:27.544 --> 03:29.145
What do you think?

03:29.213 --> 03:32.081
Construction'll be finished
in May,

03:32.149 --> 03:34.183
but the plans
are still wide open.

03:34.251 --> 03:35.985
We could design
a fabulous kitchen,

03:36.053 --> 03:37.653
maybe an indoor gym...

03:37.721 --> 03:38.821
What do you think?

03:38.888 --> 03:42.157
I think I got something
to tell ya.

03:42.225 --> 03:43.992
You know all the groundwork
I've been laying in Dubai

03:44.060 --> 03:45.160
the last few months, right?

03:45.228 --> 03:46.627
Yeah.

03:46.695 --> 03:48.930
You're not gonna believe this,
it's finally paid off.

03:48.998 --> 03:51.632
My company has an offer
to merge

03:51.700 --> 03:53.835
with an oil company there.
I mean, a big one.

03:53.903 --> 03:55.369
In Dubai.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.937
- No!    - Yeah, it's like the
chance in a lifetime, right?

03:57.005 --> 03:59.473
That's amazing! Oh my God!

03:59.540 --> 04:01.775
I'm so proud of you!

04:03.245 --> 04:04.378
So, now what?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.247
So now, uh, I gotta take
the next step,

04:06.314 --> 04:09.283
and I wanna move forward
with it right away,

04:09.351 --> 04:11.150
and I want you to come with me.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.953
To Dubai? Are you kidding?

04:14.021 --> 04:15.721
As my wife.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.023
As your wife?

04:17.091 --> 04:19.591
But we're not getting married
until...

04:19.659 --> 04:21.094
Like it's months away.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.596
Well, I just think we have
to move that up a little bit.

04:23.663 --> 04:25.064
Uh, to when?

04:25.132 --> 04:27.699
Mm, I don't know... Now?

05:13.911 --> 05:16.745
Everything has been set up
for a June wedding.

05:16.813 --> 05:18.547
- I know.
- It's all planned.

05:18.614 --> 05:20.849
Why do you have to do this now?

05:20.917 --> 05:22.517
And why do you have to be there
in person?

05:22.585 --> 05:24.886
You have a staff of people
who work for you!

05:24.955 --> 05:26.288
Okay, yes I do, but-

05:26.356 --> 05:28.523
Like you have to "merge"
in person!

05:28.591 --> 05:30.025
Like they can't do it
without you?!

05:30.093 --> 05:31.225
No they can't.

05:31.293 --> 05:32.427
I have to be there "in person"

05:32.494 --> 05:33.894
or else you get the raw end
of the deal.

05:33.963 --> 05:35.196
You know what?

05:35.264 --> 05:36.497
Don't tell me about
the raw end of the deal!

05:36.565 --> 05:39.100
Okay?! 'Cause I know about
the raw end of the deal!

05:39.168 --> 05:41.569
What is going on?

05:44.606 --> 05:46.507
Look, I'm sorry, okay.

05:46.575 --> 05:48.275
I know this isn't perfect.

05:48.343 --> 05:49.542
Not perfect?

05:49.610 --> 05:51.611
This merger
is time sensitive, okay?

05:51.679 --> 05:53.680
If it's gonna happen at all,
it has to go through now

05:53.747 --> 05:55.548
<i>before they start changing
their minds.</i>

05:55.616 --> 05:56.783
And believe me,

05:56.851 --> 05:57.884
they change their minds
a lot over there.

05:57.952 --> 05:59.019
<i>You know what then?</i>

05:59.087 --> 06:00.454
You go ahead
and you go back to Dubai

06:00.521 --> 06:01.921
and you deal with your merger,

06:01.990 --> 06:03.522
'cause I am not changing
my mind.

06:03.590 --> 06:04.790
I am not going with you

06:04.858 --> 06:08.361
and I am not moving up
the wedding!

06:08.428 --> 06:10.062
This is all because
Lou picked the clover card

06:10.130 --> 06:11.530
with her left hand.

06:11.598 --> 06:14.566
I don't know why she did that?

06:26.145 --> 06:28.213
Okay. You were right.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.616
I shouldn't have even
suggested it.

06:32.551 --> 06:34.919
We'll keep the June
wedding date.

06:34.987 --> 06:36.720
Okay?

06:36.787 --> 06:38.555
I mean, not even you could
turn it around that fast.

06:38.623 --> 06:41.058
I was crazy to think so.

06:45.463 --> 06:48.165
I'll go back over there
and get the deal done,

06:48.233 --> 06:49.533
on my own.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.234
How long will you be gone?

06:51.301 --> 06:53.536
Just a couple of months.

06:53.603 --> 06:55.538
That long?

06:55.605 --> 06:56.906
And, um...

06:56.973 --> 07:00.176
After you get the deal done,

07:00.244 --> 07:02.078
you'll just be going back
and forth

07:02.146 --> 07:03.946
like you have been, right?

07:04.014 --> 07:06.315
Well... no.

07:09.052 --> 07:11.286
After we get married,
it'd be...

07:11.354 --> 07:13.188
It'd be easier if we just...

07:13.256 --> 07:16.158
You know, if we moved there.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.494
<i>Get out!</i>

07:19.562 --> 07:20.895
Lou?!

07:20.963 --> 07:22.264
Come on, honey,
I thought you understood!

07:22.331 --> 07:23.631
Of course we have to move
to Dubai.

07:23.699 --> 07:26.100
<i>Don't talk to me!</i>

07:29.738 --> 07:31.338
Dubai?

07:31.807 --> 07:33.975
Well, you just can't let him
walk on you like that, Lou,

07:34.043 --> 07:35.276
you can't!

07:35.343 --> 07:37.045
Dad, this is my problem, okay?

07:37.112 --> 07:38.379
Not yours!

07:38.447 --> 07:40.280
Oh, look who it is!
It's the general!

07:41.515 --> 07:43.684
Hey, Lou, um...

07:43.751 --> 07:45.185
Can we talk somewhere
for a second?

07:45.252 --> 07:47.588
Where do you get off?

07:49.323 --> 07:50.657
You know, with
all due respect, Tim,

07:50.725 --> 07:51.725
honestly, it's got nothing
to do with you.

07:51.793 --> 07:53.193
So if you don't mind...

07:53.260 --> 07:54.461
Really, it doesn't?
Well, that's my daughter.

07:54.528 --> 07:55.963
And you seem to have
a very short memory

07:56.030 --> 07:57.363
because I told you
I'd punch your lights out

07:57.431 --> 07:58.498
if you didn't treat her right!

07:58.566 --> 08:00.366
<i>Dad! Stop!</i>

08:01.602 --> 08:04.070
<i>Um... can we just go somewhere,</i>

08:04.138 --> 08:05.405
talk for a second please,
sweetheart?

08:05.473 --> 08:06.872
Can we do that?
We're all adults here.

08:06.940 --> 08:08.241
You and I have to talk!

08:08.309 --> 08:09.375
Stop it!

08:10.244 --> 08:11.611
How old are you? Eight?

08:11.678 --> 08:13.178
You know what?
Just leave me alone!

08:13.246 --> 08:14.179
All of you!

08:14.247 --> 08:15.314
Honey...

08:16.182 --> 08:17.282
Make it right!

08:23.889 --> 08:25.724
My mother's driving me nuts.

08:25.791 --> 08:27.392
She wants me to send
applications

08:27.460 --> 08:29.560
to every Ivy League school
in existence,

08:29.628 --> 08:31.429
and I don't have the grades
for that!

08:31.497 --> 08:33.864
Besides, I don't even wanna
go to college.

08:33.932 --> 08:35.198
I don't know what I want to do.

08:35.267 --> 08:36.399
Me neither.

08:37.602 --> 08:39.135
<i>Ash?</i>

08:39.203 --> 08:41.238
Do you think we could maybe
talk a minute.

08:41.304 --> 08:42.438
<i>Please?</i>

08:48.179 --> 08:50.413
Caleb, we have nothing
to talk about.

08:50.481 --> 08:52.714
I thought I made it clear.
We don't have a future.

08:52.782 --> 08:53.915
Yeah, but we would

08:53.983 --> 08:55.851
if you just stopped
being so stubborn.

08:55.918 --> 08:57.119
It's just I miss you,

08:57.187 --> 09:00.556
and I can't stop
thinking about you.

09:00.624 --> 09:02.625
Last time we were together
you told me...

09:02.692 --> 09:04.360
Told me that thing...

09:04.427 --> 09:05.727
That I loved you?

09:05.795 --> 09:06.995
Yes!

09:07.063 --> 09:08.363
Yeah...

09:08.430 --> 09:10.698
I did, but I'll get over it.

09:10.766 --> 09:12.033
And besides,

09:12.100 --> 09:15.002
I'm going away to college,
so...

09:15.070 --> 09:17.338
Going to college?

09:17.406 --> 09:20.074
I gotta get back to work.

09:28.383 --> 09:30.049
Hey.

09:30.117 --> 09:31.284
Hey.

09:31.352 --> 09:32.819
I brought you something to eat.

09:32.887 --> 09:34.688
You missed dinner.

09:34.756 --> 09:36.690
I'm not hungry.

09:36.758 --> 09:38.458
What's wrong? You okay?

09:38.526 --> 09:40.459
I don't know.

09:40.527 --> 09:42.995
I don't know what to say
to Peter, right now.

09:43.062 --> 09:44.129
I mean...

09:45.098 --> 09:47.165
I have a right to be mad
at him.

09:47.233 --> 09:50.302
It was so unfair of him
to just hit me with this.

09:50.370 --> 09:52.772
You know?
I've lived in New York;

09:52.839 --> 09:56.441
I know what it's like
to be away from home.

09:56.509 --> 10:00.812
But the thought of being
so far away from home...

10:01.714 --> 10:03.281
I don't know
if I can do it or not.

10:03.348 --> 10:05.717
You'll be fine. You will.

10:06.619 --> 10:07.886
You know what?

10:07.953 --> 10:09.387
This is gonna be
an amazing adventure.

10:09.455 --> 10:10.688
And look at Peter -

10:10.756 --> 10:12.223
he flies back and forth
from Dubai

10:12.291 --> 10:14.224
like he's on a bus.

10:14.292 --> 10:19.262
Plus, I hear the shopping
is pretty amazing over there.

10:20.164 --> 10:23.300
You know who would know
what to do?

10:23.367 --> 10:25.168
Mom.

10:25.236 --> 10:26.369
I never thought
I'd be getting married

10:26.438 --> 10:28.438
without her here.

10:30.441 --> 10:31.908
I miss her.

10:33.710 --> 10:35.778
I need her advice.

10:36.747 --> 10:39.482
I know what Mom would say.

10:40.116 --> 10:42.752
She would ask you
if you really love him.

10:42.820 --> 10:44.653
Of course I do.

10:45.755 --> 10:49.123
I'm furious with him right now,

10:50.059 --> 10:51.726
but I still love him.

10:51.794 --> 10:54.329
Then maybe the wedding
being in June

10:54.396 --> 10:56.832
isn't what's important.

10:57.633 --> 11:00.001
Maybe you should
marry Peter now

11:00.069 --> 11:01.368
and be with him in Dubai,

11:01.436 --> 11:04.438
instead of being here
in beautiful Hudson

11:04.506 --> 11:07.407
all by yourself without him.

11:10.846 --> 11:15.248
But it was
gonna be so special.

11:15.316 --> 11:17.450
I can't have tents
with pinnacles in the winter.

11:35.034 --> 11:36.535
What do you want?

11:36.603 --> 11:38.403
What do I want?

11:39.572 --> 11:41.139
Amy Fleming.

11:42.475 --> 11:43.742
She around?

11:49.337 --> 11:50.671
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

11:50.738 --> 11:53.107
Garrett told me to look you up.

11:53.175 --> 11:54.107
Why?

11:54.175 --> 11:55.175
Well, one of my show horses

11:55.242 --> 11:56.676
is suddenly nothing
but trouble.

11:56.743 --> 11:57.843
I want you to have a look
at him.

11:57.911 --> 11:59.045
See if you can work some
of your...

11:59.113 --> 12:01.481
"Miracle Girl" magic.

12:02.283 --> 12:05.151
It's what you do, isn't it?

12:05.219 --> 12:07.320
Forget it.
If you treated that horse

12:07.388 --> 12:08.488
like the one you did
in the ring,

12:08.556 --> 12:10.822
then it's no wonder
it has issues.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.524
Too busy to deal with it,
sorry.

12:12.592 --> 12:14.926
I didn't come all this way
to be turned down.

12:14.994 --> 12:17.196
All right, you heard her.

12:18.098 --> 12:20.865
She's got no time for you.

12:28.140 --> 12:29.540
Thank you.

12:48.493 --> 12:51.461
Can we just pretend we never
had that conversation?

12:51.529 --> 12:52.662
Please?

12:54.198 --> 12:57.934
Honestly, I can't stand it
when you're mad at me, Lou.

12:58.002 --> 13:00.869
I'm mad at you for the way
that you told me.

13:00.937 --> 13:02.871
That should've been a decision
that we made together.

13:02.939 --> 13:05.707
And you just...
And you sprung it on me.

13:05.775 --> 13:08.710
I totally understand that.
But...

13:08.778 --> 13:11.480
I'd just gotten the call
that it was all a go.

13:11.548 --> 13:12.848
You know?
And I was excited about it.

13:12.915 --> 13:14.382
I was just... I was...

13:14.450 --> 13:18.620
Trying to think of ways
to make it happen.

13:18.687 --> 13:22.157
Okay, I was an idiot.

13:22.991 --> 13:24.159
Sorry.

13:24.226 --> 13:25.993
You know...

13:26.061 --> 13:29.664
I put a lot of work
into this place,

13:29.731 --> 13:32.832
planning it, building it up.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.868
And I'm proud
of how it turned out.

13:37.639 --> 13:42.509
I wonder what it'll be like
when I'm not here to run it.

13:42.577 --> 13:44.211
Hey...

13:45.146 --> 13:47.547
Look, honey,
you don't have to...

13:47.614 --> 13:50.249
No, I've thought about it

13:50.317 --> 13:53.118
and I can pull it together.

13:54.288 --> 13:57.122
I'm determined to make it work.

13:57.191 --> 13:58.257
You...

14:00.227 --> 14:02.260
Are an amazing woman.

14:02.328 --> 14:03.395
I know.

14:13.739 --> 14:15.407
Everyone...

14:15.474 --> 14:17.342
We have an announcement
to make.

14:17.410 --> 14:19.410
Peter and I have made
a decision...

14:19.477 --> 14:21.545
Together.

14:21.613 --> 14:23.013
We're going to be getting
married sooner

14:23.081 --> 14:24.615
rather than later,

14:24.683 --> 14:26.917
and we will be moving to Dubai

14:26.984 --> 14:28.785
<i>right after it.</i>

14:29.821 --> 14:31.422
When's the wedding?

14:31.489 --> 14:32.789
It's two weeks Saturday.

14:32.857 --> 14:33.757
Two weeks?

14:33.825 --> 14:35.925
Dad, please.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.531
Well, I'd like to make
a toast then.

14:42.466 --> 14:44.567
To you Lou, to you Peter.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.269
We all wish you the very best.

14:46.337 --> 14:48.137
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

14:49.573 --> 14:53.074
- Congratulations.
- Congrats, guys.

14:59.414 --> 15:01.349
<i>So, we'll get married
in the living room</i>

15:01.416 --> 15:02.984
<i>with just a few guests.</i>

15:03.052 --> 15:05.519
So much less fuss,
so much more personal.

15:05.587 --> 15:06.687
So not you.

15:06.756 --> 15:09.390
Everything is going
to be fine, okay?

15:09.458 --> 15:11.425
Marnie's still good to cater.

15:11.493 --> 15:14.762
<i>And Peter's family is coming
from Saskatchewan.</i>

15:14.829 --> 15:15.929
And every time I feel

15:15.997 --> 15:17.464
like I'm gonna be sick
to my stomach,

15:17.531 --> 15:20.567
I just look at this picture
of my dress

15:20.635 --> 15:22.069
and I know everything
will be fine.

15:22.137 --> 15:23.436
No, I'm sorry.

15:23.504 --> 15:24.938
I don't have time
to talk to you right now.

15:25.006 --> 15:26.506
Okay. Bye.

15:27.541 --> 15:28.876
Can you believe the nerve
of this Chase Powers guy?

15:28.943 --> 15:30.209
He comes over and asks
for my help

15:30.277 --> 15:32.278
with a horse
that he probably ruined.

15:32.345 --> 15:33.479
Now he keeps calling me.

15:33.546 --> 15:34.947
What is your problem?

15:35.015 --> 15:36.749
The number one horse whisperer
in the country

15:36.817 --> 15:38.450
is asking for your help?

15:38.518 --> 15:39.685
If you fix his horse,

15:39.753 --> 15:40.787
do you have any idea
what that's gonna do

15:40.854 --> 15:42.054
for your reputation?

15:42.122 --> 15:44.490
No, I don't care.
I don't like him.

15:44.557 --> 15:46.091
And besides...

15:46.159 --> 15:48.293
I'm the number one horse
whisperer in the country now.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.829
Someone's getting an ego.

15:50.897 --> 15:53.198
Hello? Yeah, speaking.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.066
Uh-oh.

15:55.134 --> 15:57.669
- What?
- What?

15:57.736 --> 15:58.804
What do you mean?

15:58.871 --> 16:00.705
<i>That's not possible.</i>

16:00.773 --> 16:02.039
You're sorry?

16:02.107 --> 16:05.276
Well, um, I'm a lot more sorry
than you are.

16:05.343 --> 16:06.777
And I'll tell what,

16:06.845 --> 16:09.713
I will never buy another
wedding dress from you again,

16:09.781 --> 16:11.115
ever! Goodbye.

16:14.152 --> 16:15.786
Our dresses...

16:15.854 --> 16:17.521
They won't be ready.

16:17.588 --> 16:18.922
The empty trunk.

16:18.989 --> 16:20.489
It's the "something
will go missing" card.

16:20.557 --> 16:24.294
Would you just put those
damn things away?!

16:28.532 --> 16:29.999
<i>Hey.</i>

16:31.335 --> 16:33.703
Plannin' on taking a trip
or something?

16:33.770 --> 16:35.470
Uh... Amy is.

16:35.538 --> 16:36.705
She wants me to go on
the "Ring of Fire" tour

16:36.772 --> 16:37.806
with her.

16:37.874 --> 16:39.074
Wow.

16:39.142 --> 16:41.844
That'd be all right I guess.
I mean...

16:41.911 --> 16:44.379
Be a lot of standing around
doin' nothing though -

16:44.447 --> 16:45.647
for you.

16:45.715 --> 16:47.182
Actually,
before all this came up,

16:47.250 --> 16:49.917
I was thinking of doing
a little road trip myself.

16:49.985 --> 16:51.518
You know,
before vet school starts

16:51.586 --> 16:53.120
and I get tied up for
the next four years of my life.

16:53.188 --> 16:55.323
- Yeah. - I gotta do it, man.
It's kind of now or never.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.623
You told Amy yet?

16:56.691 --> 16:58.125
Uh...

16:58.760 --> 17:00.061
You know, the timing's
not really the greatest.

17:00.128 --> 17:01.495
So, I'm just gonna wait

17:01.563 --> 17:04.165
till things get back to,
you know, normal.

17:04.233 --> 17:05.432
<i>Okay.</i>

17:05.500 --> 17:06.867
<i>So...</i>

17:06.934 --> 17:07.968
I'm thinking about
asking Ashley

17:08.035 --> 17:09.368
to come with me on the circuit.

17:09.435 --> 17:10.904
Hold on. What about
the whole bad luck

17:10.972 --> 17:13.439
superstition voodoo stuff
that you...?

17:13.507 --> 17:15.175
Yeah, I know, I know.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.943
But... thing is,

17:17.011 --> 17:19.846
it's really just girlfriends
that bring bad luck.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.146
So what are you saying?

17:21.214 --> 17:22.281
I'm thinking about
asking Ashley

17:22.348 --> 17:25.550
to be more than
just a girlfriend.

17:29.022 --> 17:30.389
You're nuts, man!

17:30.456 --> 17:32.624
Yes. Yes, I am.

17:41.566 --> 17:42.733
<i>Chase, no.</i>

17:42.801 --> 17:44.635
I told you that
I wasn't gonna take him on.

17:44.703 --> 17:47.505
I thought I'd give
you one last chance.

17:47.572 --> 17:49.941
I want you to meet Zephyr.

17:50.009 --> 17:51.675
Wow.

17:51.743 --> 17:52.810
What?

17:54.045 --> 17:55.512
He just...

17:55.579 --> 17:56.947
He looks exactly like
my mom's old horse, Pegasus.

17:57.015 --> 17:58.548
He just passed away.

17:59.517 --> 18:01.785
Well, he's acting
like he knows you.

18:01.852 --> 18:03.520
Maybe it's meant to be, then.

18:03.587 --> 18:05.022
<i>Hey!</i>

18:05.089 --> 18:06.523
How many times you gotta be
kicked off the property?

18:06.590 --> 18:07.891
No, Ty, it's okay.

18:07.959 --> 18:09.026
No, it's not okay.
She told you to leave!

18:09.093 --> 18:10.492
No. Ty. I'm...

18:10.560 --> 18:12.661
Actually, I'm gonna help him
with his horse.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.134
Easy, boy.

18:19.236 --> 18:20.303
Easy.

18:20.370 --> 18:21.637
You see?
Can't get a bridle on him.

18:23.340 --> 18:25.408
He gets all high-headed.

18:26.242 --> 18:28.476
All right...

18:29.378 --> 18:30.979
<i>Okay, you...</i>

18:34.716 --> 18:35.984
Hy!

18:40.389 --> 18:43.123
It's like watching paint dry.

18:44.892 --> 18:47.061
You've been in the
competitive world too long.

18:47.128 --> 18:49.529
Horse problems sometimes take
more than three hours.

18:49.597 --> 18:51.098
Mm.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.615
Good boy.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.151
Good boy.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.687
Good boy.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.359
That's incredible.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.427
Well, if the horse senses
you're impatient at all,

19:22.495 --> 19:23.862
it won't work.

19:23.929 --> 19:27.699
Good boy.
He's gotta trust you.

19:27.766 --> 19:30.034
And this guy,
he's totally stressed out.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.668
Probably from
all the travelling.

19:31.736 --> 19:33.971
Yeah, that could be.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.740
You're the real deal,
aren't you?

19:36.808 --> 19:39.143
Garrett was right.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.244
So I heard you got invited

19:40.312 --> 19:41.845
to go on
the "Ring of Fire" tour.

19:41.913 --> 19:44.015
You should think about going.

19:44.082 --> 19:45.282
I don't know.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.484
It's a fantastic experience.

19:47.551 --> 19:48.718
Garrett's not on it this time,

19:48.785 --> 19:50.920
but this legendary dude
from Oklahoma is,

19:50.988 --> 19:52.188
and uh...

19:52.256 --> 19:54.257
He's amazing to watch.

19:54.325 --> 19:55.492
We'd learn a lot from him.

19:57.161 --> 19:58.995
I'm sorry, you just don't seem
like the type of guy

19:59.063 --> 20:01.464
who learns a lot
from other people.

20:01.532 --> 20:02.998
I mean, in the ring,
you're just so...

20:03.066 --> 20:05.234
Charismatic and handsome, yeah.

20:05.301 --> 20:07.036
Arrogant.

20:07.103 --> 20:09.804
Well, people expect a show,
so that's what I give 'em.

20:09.872 --> 20:12.974
It's a persona I put on,
just like the clothes.

20:13.043 --> 20:14.309
You can't tell me

20:14.377 --> 20:15.477
you go jumping over stacks
of barrels bareback

20:15.545 --> 20:17.079
every day of the year either.

20:17.147 --> 20:18.979
You've got a little showmanship
going there too, miracle girl.

20:21.650 --> 20:22.583
I know it's none
of my business,

20:22.651 --> 20:24.585
but what's with the ring?

20:24.653 --> 20:26.220
You engaged to that guy
or something?

20:26.288 --> 20:28.689
Oh. Um, no,
it's a promise ring.

20:28.757 --> 20:32.193
"Promise" ring.
Promise to, uh... to what?

20:32.261 --> 20:34.327
To be there. To...

20:39.133 --> 20:40.100
My mother made the list for me

20:40.168 --> 20:41.401
to be honest with you, so...

20:41.469 --> 20:42.769
Okay, well, I don't know
what to tell you

20:42.836 --> 20:44.304
because they're not all gonna
fit in this room.

20:44.372 --> 20:45.572
So we'll get a bigger room.

20:45.639 --> 20:47.607
What? Overflow in the kitchen?

20:47.675 --> 20:49.242
<i>In the bathroom?</i>

20:49.310 --> 20:50.742
<i>We'll rent a hall
or something.</i>

20:50.810 --> 20:52.010
<i>No. Look, that is so impersonal.</i>

20:52.079 --> 20:53.946
Look, I want to have
a connection with the place.

20:54.013 --> 20:55.514
Like when it was
at the dude ranch,

20:55.582 --> 20:57.516
that meant something to me.

20:57.584 --> 20:59.151
Okay. Hey, you know
what we should do?

20:59.219 --> 21:02.654
- What? - We'll rent a nice suite
at a hotel in Calgary.

21:02.722 --> 21:04.256
Like you did
for your first wedding?

21:04.324 --> 21:06.024
Um...

21:06.092 --> 21:07.392
<i>An idea.</i>

21:07.460 --> 21:08.659
The Golf and Country Club?

21:08.727 --> 21:09.727
Uh, no.

21:09.795 --> 21:12.130
It is old and moldy. No.

21:12.198 --> 21:13.298
<i>All right.</i>

21:13.365 --> 21:15.467
Uh, another suggestion.

21:15.534 --> 21:16.968
Polo club?

21:17.603 --> 21:20.271
Well, eloping's looking better
and better, isn't it?

21:20.339 --> 21:21.406
Come here.

21:22.273 --> 21:23.507
I gotta meet a guy
at a job site.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.542
- I'll call you, okay?
- Okay.

21:26.478 --> 21:27.444
Wow.

21:27.812 --> 21:29.513
So much for my dream wedding.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.315
Um, we're getting married
in a week

21:31.382 --> 21:32.716
and I don't know where,

21:32.783 --> 21:34.418
uh, who's coming,
and best part,

21:34.486 --> 21:36.052
I don't have a wedding dress.

21:36.121 --> 21:37.454
What happened to your dress?

21:37.522 --> 21:39.122
The bridal store in New York
let me down.

21:39.189 --> 21:40.189
Oh, Lou.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.291
Yeah, not surprised really.

21:42.359 --> 21:43.692
Lou, let's...

21:44.628 --> 21:46.862
Let's just go have a look
at the polo club.

21:48.165 --> 21:50.733
Okay. I'll go get my coat.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.935
Oh, that poor kid.

21:53.003 --> 21:54.236
And you know what?

21:54.303 --> 21:56.004
I would help more,
you know I would,

21:56.071 --> 21:57.672
but you remember
the last wedding fiasco.

21:57.740 --> 21:59.474
I don't want her to resent me.

21:59.542 --> 22:02.611
Yes, I do. I remember it well.

22:07.150 --> 22:09.451
You know, Grandpa,
I gotta say,

22:09.519 --> 22:12.653
I thought Lisa would've
helped me out a bit more.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.588
Well, here I am in the middle
of a crisis

22:14.656 --> 22:17.158
and she's acting as if she's
totally disinterested

22:17.225 --> 22:18.159
in the whole thing.

22:18.226 --> 22:19.993
Well, she's not.

22:21.963 --> 22:23.964
And you should talk to her.

22:24.032 --> 22:27.267
She's just afraid to.
Oh, you know.

22:27.334 --> 22:29.135
Afraid to what?

22:30.371 --> 22:31.504
Where are we?

22:34.808 --> 22:38.878
Your grandma and I,
we tied the knot right here.

22:40.247 --> 22:42.548
And uh...
Well, I thought it was...

22:43.483 --> 22:45.484
Well, maybe it was an option.

22:48.254 --> 22:49.388
It's perfect!

22:50.723 --> 22:51.956
It's charming.

22:53.226 --> 22:55.227
It has a history.

22:55.961 --> 22:57.229
It's perfect!

22:57.297 --> 22:58.829
This is the place, Grandpa!
This is it!

22:58.897 --> 23:00.130
I can feel it!

23:01.333 --> 23:05.169
For the first time,
I can actually feel it!

23:06.104 --> 23:07.505
Thank you!

23:12.244 --> 23:13.311
Looking good.

23:14.245 --> 23:15.412
You know, I really think

23:15.479 --> 23:17.146
you need to take the heat
off of him.

23:17.215 --> 23:19.949
Stop competing for awhile
and just let him be a horse.

23:20.017 --> 23:21.718
Okay, I hear you.

23:21.785 --> 23:24.053
I'm gonna put him on a
regimen of anti-stress herbs,

23:24.121 --> 23:25.589
and that should help out
as well.

23:25.656 --> 23:28.191
Great. Sounds great.

23:28.259 --> 23:30.959
So hey, uh,
speaking of travelling,

23:31.027 --> 23:32.628
I gotta head outta town
for a week or two

23:32.696 --> 23:35.264
and I was wondering
if maybe you could, um...

23:35.332 --> 23:36.832
Yeah, I can keep him here
if you like?

23:36.899 --> 23:38.701
That way I can work with him
some more.

23:38.768 --> 23:39.768
<i>Okay.</i>

23:39.836 --> 23:41.103
That'd be great.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.338
Okay.

23:42.405 --> 23:43.972
So I guess I'll see you
when I get back.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.741
And uh...

23:45.808 --> 23:48.109
Thought any more about joining
the "Ring of Fire" tour?

23:49.044 --> 23:50.111
Um...

23:52.881 --> 23:53.948
I'm still thinking about it.

23:56.051 --> 23:57.385
< <i>All right.</i>

24:01.290 --> 24:02.723
Well, I'll see you later.

24:02.790 --> 24:03.857
Okay.

24:11.633 --> 24:13.433
They were the only ones
I could find.

24:13.501 --> 24:16.536
Everything else
had to be specially made.

24:16.604 --> 24:17.937
But you know what?
If you don't like them,

24:18.005 --> 24:20.139
I'll just take them back.

24:21.308 --> 24:23.309
They're... they're good.

24:23.377 --> 24:24.377
Yeah.

24:29.716 --> 24:31.284
I look like a big meringue.

24:36.389 --> 24:37.455
Fluffy.

24:55.029 --> 24:56.729
- Hey, Tim?
- Hm?

24:57.146 --> 24:59.515
Listen, I just wanted to say
thanks a lot for the party.

24:59.583 --> 25:00.583
It's great.

25:00.650 --> 25:02.351
Yeah.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.352
Rush job.

25:05.287 --> 25:06.354
Okay.

25:08.223 --> 25:09.691
Look at this. Right?

25:09.759 --> 25:11.158
This is working
just the way we thought.

25:11.226 --> 25:12.927
Yeah, it's lovely. Good.

25:12.995 --> 25:15.430
Hey, you know, Lisa,
I have to ask you something.

25:15.498 --> 25:18.465
Um... did you and Grandpa
decide not to get married

25:18.533 --> 25:20.166
because of me?

25:20.234 --> 25:21.968
Oh no. No, no. Of course not.

25:22.036 --> 25:24.971
We, uh...
I mean, no, not completely.

25:25.039 --> 25:29.376
Because I would understand
if you resented me a bit.

25:29.444 --> 25:31.311
Lou, what?

25:31.379 --> 25:32.813
I don't know, I just...

25:32.881 --> 25:35.648
I could've used
a little more input from you

25:35.716 --> 25:37.383
over these past few days.

25:37.451 --> 25:38.418
Oh!

25:38.485 --> 25:39.552
Excuse me, guys. I'm sorry.

25:39.620 --> 25:40.853
Can I borrow
my bride-to-be here?

25:40.921 --> 25:42.087
Sure, sure.

25:42.155 --> 25:45.090
Hey, Ty,
are you gonna talk to me?

25:45.158 --> 25:46.058
About what?

25:46.126 --> 25:47.860
Anything?

25:47.928 --> 25:49.662
I'm gonna go get drinks
for people.

25:49.730 --> 25:51.062
Ty...

25:51.130 --> 25:52.964
You invite that new friend
of yours.

25:53.032 --> 25:54.966
Who? Chase? No.

25:55.034 --> 25:56.568
Why would I?

25:56.636 --> 25:58.904
I don't know,
you guys seem pretty close.

25:58.971 --> 26:00.271
Ty!

26:00.339 --> 26:01.272
<i>You giving him a hard time,</i>

26:01.340 --> 26:03.241
that got anything to do

26:03.309 --> 26:05.710
with the California
racing schedule?

26:05.778 --> 26:07.812
Your best before date
running out is it?

26:07.879 --> 26:09.947
I'm a little behind schedule,
but the wedding plans changed,

26:10.014 --> 26:11.214
so... I'll get there.

26:11.282 --> 26:12.316
Well, I suppose
you could've missed

26:12.383 --> 26:14.151
your own daughter's wedding.

26:14.218 --> 26:17.087
You missed
most everything else.

26:17.155 --> 26:20.290
No, I don't think I'd miss
Lou's wedding, Jack.

26:20.358 --> 26:22.092
I mean, I gotta give
her away, after all.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.426
You'll be giving her away?!

26:23.494 --> 26:25.528
Is that right?

26:25.596 --> 26:29.065
Who raised her from the time
she was 15-years-old?

26:29.132 --> 26:31.367
Hm? That would be me.

26:31.435 --> 26:33.570
I'll be the one
giving her away.

26:33.637 --> 26:36.973
Well, you'll have to get past
me first, old man.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.775
You know, I can't
believe you two.

26:39.843 --> 26:42.978
I'll walk myself
down the aisle.

26:43.045 --> 26:44.813
Honey. Were...

26:44.881 --> 26:45.948
Lou!

26:47.149 --> 26:48.116
Look, what you did?

26:48.184 --> 26:49.651
Me?

26:49.719 --> 26:52.420
Why do you make everything
feel like a root canal?

26:52.489 --> 26:53.555
God!

26:54.556 --> 26:56.123
Have you heard from Ashley?

26:56.191 --> 26:57.959
I can't get her on her cell.

26:58.026 --> 26:59.961
Um... I think she was
headed over to Caleb's

27:00.028 --> 27:01.028
to pick him up.

27:01.096 --> 27:02.463
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

27:02.531 --> 27:05.265
Yeah. I just wish
she'd keep me in the loop.

27:19.714 --> 27:21.280
Pretty.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.415
Thanks.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.585
So? What's the occasion?

27:26.520 --> 27:29.221
I was hoping I could talk you
into something.

27:29.288 --> 27:31.323
Caleb, I know you want me

27:31.391 --> 27:32.825
to go on the rodeo circuit
with you.

27:32.893 --> 27:34.259
But... hello?

27:35.194 --> 27:37.295
I'm not your girlfriend
any more, remember?

27:38.532 --> 27:41.466
Maybe I don't want you to go
as my girlfriend.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.334
What would want me to go as?

27:43.402 --> 27:45.136
Well...

27:45.203 --> 27:50.008
I was hoping maybe that's
what we could talk about.

27:53.145 --> 27:54.478
Are you sure you're okay?

27:54.547 --> 27:58.749
I am just a nervous bride
on the eve of her wedding.

27:58.816 --> 27:59.883
Okay.

27:59.951 --> 28:01.718
You know I love you, right?

28:01.786 --> 28:03.086
I do.

28:03.154 --> 28:04.354
Save that for tomorrow.

28:12.597 --> 28:14.031
I'll see you in church.

28:14.098 --> 28:15.164
Yeah.

28:22.472 --> 28:23.539
Lou...

28:25.308 --> 28:26.442
Hey.

28:26.509 --> 28:28.077
Uh, honey...

28:32.014 --> 28:36.084
I know I haven't exactly been
in the best frame of mind

28:36.151 --> 28:38.219
through this whole thing.

28:38.287 --> 28:42.423
But can you blame me?
What father would be?

28:42.892 --> 28:46.027
It's just I'm gonna miss you
so much.

28:46.095 --> 28:48.161
No, don't say it, Dad.

28:48.229 --> 28:49.496
Okay.

28:49.564 --> 28:52.165
I've got something for you.

28:53.101 --> 28:54.735
I gave this to your mom

28:54.803 --> 28:56.637
just before we got married,

28:56.705 --> 28:58.772
and you may wanna wear it,

28:58.840 --> 29:00.574
you may not...

29:13.053 --> 29:14.453
Ty!

29:14.888 --> 29:17.456
Look, I don't wanna go
to this wedding tomorrow

29:17.524 --> 29:18.924
and pretend to be all happy

29:18.992 --> 29:20.859
if you and I don't talk
this through.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.028
Okay? I just hate it
when you're mad at me.

29:23.096 --> 29:24.062
I'm not mad at you.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.497
Yes, you are.

29:25.564 --> 29:26.732
You're mad at me
for taking on Chase's horse.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.133
And...

29:28.200 --> 29:29.367
It's just he had
a real problem with Zephyr

29:29.435 --> 29:30.836
and he asked me if I could help

29:30.903 --> 29:32.638
and I wanted to see
what I can do.

29:32.705 --> 29:34.372
We have to stick together
in this business.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.340
"In this business"?

29:36.407 --> 29:38.442
What, so now that you have
the big honkin' flamin' truck

29:38.510 --> 29:39.543
in the driveway,

29:39.611 --> 29:40.511
you're definitely
one of them...

29:40.578 --> 29:42.279
In this business?

29:42.347 --> 29:43.714
- No.   - Next thing
you're gonna tell me

29:43.782 --> 29:44.749
you're going on
the "Ring of Fire" tour

29:44.816 --> 29:46.050
with that guy.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.417
Did he talk you into it?

29:47.485 --> 29:49.153
Chase didn't talk me
into anything, okay?

29:49.220 --> 29:51.420
I haven't even decided
whether I'm going to or not,

29:51.488 --> 29:52.756
and...

29:52.823 --> 29:55.158
Besides...

29:55.225 --> 29:56.459
I didn't think
it was gonna be just me;

29:56.527 --> 30:00.063
I thought it was gonna be
you and I.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.531
I can't...

30:03.267 --> 30:04.300
I can't...

30:04.368 --> 30:06.136
You can't what?

30:06.203 --> 30:08.737
I need to do my own thing.

30:08.805 --> 30:11.239
Maybe some travelling, or...

30:11.307 --> 30:13.275
Some travelling.

30:13.342 --> 30:14.409
Amy...

30:16.579 --> 30:18.580
Look, I love you.

30:19.783 --> 30:22.884
But I need to do this,
and I need to do it alone.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.052
Okay.

30:25.054 --> 30:26.353
Just don't tell me what to do,

30:26.421 --> 30:27.588
or what not to do.

30:27.656 --> 30:29.123
I'm not telling you what to do.

30:29.191 --> 30:31.458
Yes you are!
When have I told you what to do?

30:31.526 --> 30:34.095
And even if I did,
you wouldn't listen to me!

30:34.163 --> 30:36.964
You're right. You're right.

30:38.933 --> 30:42.836
I guess this doesn't
mean much any more.

30:49.439 --> 30:52.441
So, what's going on
with you and Amy?

30:52.509 --> 30:55.712
Not that it's any
of my business.

30:55.780 --> 30:57.881
I need a few weeks off.

30:57.948 --> 30:58.982
Is that okay?

30:59.050 --> 31:00.116
Weeks?

31:00.917 --> 31:03.819
Well, I guess.
Is there a reason?

31:03.887 --> 31:05.353
Does there have to be?

31:05.421 --> 31:09.391
If you're leaving for weeks,
there damn well better be.

31:09.458 --> 31:13.062
I need to go somewhere
on my own.

31:13.129 --> 31:14.496
So that's why you guys

31:14.564 --> 31:17.899
are giving each other
the cold shoulder?

31:17.966 --> 31:20.101
Yeah, well,
Amy's not taking it too good.

31:20.169 --> 31:21.435
She wants me to go

31:21.503 --> 31:22.704
on the "Ring of Fire" tour
with her,

31:22.771 --> 31:24.105
but she's gonna have plenty
of company without me.

31:24.173 --> 31:26.741
What "Ring of Fire" tour?

31:26.809 --> 31:28.943
Look, I haven't decided yet.
Okay?

31:29.011 --> 31:30.444
Well, you can't go on your own.

31:30.512 --> 31:31.813
Someone's gotta go with you.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.914
Ty said he would
but then he ditched me.

31:33.981 --> 31:35.882
Did he now?

31:35.950 --> 31:37.617
No...

31:38.419 --> 31:40.087
I don't know.

31:41.355 --> 31:42.856
I think we just broke up.

31:42.924 --> 31:46.593
I can't deal with this
on top of everything else.

31:46.660 --> 31:48.595
Okay? I just need to get away
for a little while.

31:48.662 --> 31:50.029
Please, just come with me?

31:50.097 --> 31:51.630
I'm not going anywhere.

31:51.698 --> 31:53.465
Grampa?! Fine!

31:53.533 --> 31:55.901
I guess I'm not going either
then.

31:55.969 --> 31:57.169
What?

31:57.237 --> 31:58.704
What's wrong now?

31:58.772 --> 31:59.872
<i>What's wrong?</i>

31:59.940 --> 32:01.140
I'll tell you what's wrong.

32:01.208 --> 32:02.641
I just got off the phone
with Peter

32:02.709 --> 32:05.309
and his family is stuck
at the Saskatoon airport.

32:05.377 --> 32:07.011
There's a major blizzard
and they can't get out.

32:07.079 --> 32:09.948
And, Grandpa, please tell me
you remembered that limo?

32:10.015 --> 32:11.249
Oh my God,
is that the right time?!

32:11.316 --> 32:12.784
I've gotta get ready.

32:16.255 --> 32:19.224
This is completely surreal.

32:19.291 --> 32:21.925
I feel like I'm having
an out of body experience.

32:21.993 --> 32:23.827
It's okay, Lou.
Just breathe all right.

32:26.564 --> 32:27.831
Hi.

32:27.899 --> 32:29.166
Hey.

32:29.234 --> 32:30.700
Can I have a second
with the bride?

32:30.769 --> 32:31.835
Of course.

32:34.272 --> 32:35.839
Whatcha got there?

32:37.374 --> 32:39.809
Open the top box.

32:39.877 --> 32:40.943
Okay.

32:50.553 --> 32:52.488
Is this...?

32:52.555 --> 32:53.855
<i>Oh my God.</i>

32:54.791 --> 32:56.124
My dress!

32:57.226 --> 32:58.293
My dress!

33:00.863 --> 33:02.864
Lisa, how did you do this?

33:02.932 --> 33:05.867
I have a friend
who knows a friend in New York

33:05.935 --> 33:07.635
who knows the designer,

33:07.703 --> 33:09.670
and when she heard
your sad story,

33:09.737 --> 33:13.107
she pulled out all the stops
and got your dress done.

33:13.175 --> 33:14.975
And the girls' too.

33:15.043 --> 33:17.377
I don't know how to thank you.

33:17.445 --> 33:18.545
Honey, I don't want
you to think

33:18.613 --> 33:19.947
that I didn't wanna help more.

33:20.015 --> 33:22.349
It's all I can do to keep
from jumping in there

33:22.417 --> 33:24.951
and standing on your toes
and taking over.

33:25.019 --> 33:29.022
But you remember
how that went last time.

33:31.758 --> 33:35.594
Though I'm sure you
must be missing your mom...

33:35.662 --> 33:38.832
I would never try to fill
her shoes,

33:38.899 --> 33:40.933
but if you need anything ever,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.601
or you just wanna talk,

33:43.669 --> 33:44.736
I'm here.

33:53.046 --> 33:56.114
God! I haven't worn a tie
for as long as I can remember.

33:56.182 --> 33:58.482
I can't breathe in the thing.

33:58.550 --> 34:01.886
Did you get those lapel
flowery thingies?

34:01.954 --> 34:03.187
Aw geez!

34:05.090 --> 34:07.458
Look at the two of you.

34:07.525 --> 34:08.592
Wow.

34:12.664 --> 34:14.998
Here comes our bride.

34:21.739 --> 34:22.804
Um, Dad?

34:24.708 --> 34:25.942
Grandpa?

34:27.311 --> 34:28.511
I would be honoured

34:28.579 --> 34:31.414
if you would both
walk me down the aisle.

34:32.349 --> 34:33.616
And I would be honoured
to do that.

34:36.186 --> 34:38.020
Okay. Is the limo here?

34:38.088 --> 34:39.389
Where is that damn limo?

34:39.456 --> 34:41.257
You and I should get going.

34:46.529 --> 34:47.596
Okay.

34:48.531 --> 34:49.598
Here you go. Thanks.

34:52.768 --> 34:54.569
Hi, it's Mom.

34:54.637 --> 34:56.804
Where are you?
I'm worried sick!

34:56.873 --> 34:59.107
What do you mean you're fine?

34:59.174 --> 35:00.909
<i>Ashley, is that Caleb's voice?</i>

35:00.976 --> 35:02.443
Where are you?!

35:02.511 --> 35:04.077
Ashley, don't you-

35:04.780 --> 35:05.513
Ashley?!

35:06.782 --> 35:08.115
Hi, how are ya?

35:09.451 --> 35:11.519
<i>I understand.</i>

35:12.120 --> 35:13.421
Does not surprise me at all.

35:13.488 --> 35:14.555
<i>Thank you.</i>

35:15.924 --> 35:18.324
Forgot to book the limo.

35:18.392 --> 35:20.627
Grandpa!
Did you forget to do it?

35:20.694 --> 35:22.829
No, I didn't! And calm down.

35:22.897 --> 35:24.931
<i>There is a solution to this.</i>

35:24.998 --> 35:27.133
There's always a solution.

35:35.508 --> 35:38.410
Careful now, watch your step.

35:40.880 --> 35:43.515
We'll be right there.

35:45.718 --> 35:47.653
I can't breathe, Grampa.

35:47.720 --> 35:48.921
I can't breathe.

35:48.988 --> 35:52.156
Just calm down
and take in some air.

35:52.223 --> 35:53.190
Okay.

36:02.367 --> 36:03.434
Lou?

36:11.642 --> 36:13.242
Are you all right?

36:13.310 --> 36:14.544
Grandpa...

36:15.847 --> 36:17.748
I don't think I can do this.

36:30.248 --> 36:31.748
Hey, listen. Thanks a lot
for standing in for my brother.

36:31.816 --> 36:33.016
Oh, no problem, man.
No problem.

36:33.083 --> 36:34.150
<i>Thanks.</i>

36:36.921 --> 36:37.987
Okay.

36:38.923 --> 36:40.089
Honey, what's wrong?

36:40.157 --> 36:41.825
I don't know.

36:43.795 --> 36:45.462
I'm gonna miss you.

36:46.931 --> 36:48.531
I'm gonna miss home.

36:48.599 --> 36:51.300
Home is not going anywhere
and either am I.

36:51.368 --> 36:53.969
But is this the right thing
to do?

36:54.037 --> 36:57.607
Because if I do this,
then it changes everything.

36:57.674 --> 36:59.975
And...

37:00.043 --> 37:02.512
And I don't wanna lose
what I have here.

37:02.579 --> 37:05.647
You have to ask yourself
one question.

37:05.715 --> 37:07.616
Do you love him?

37:09.586 --> 37:12.654
'Cause if you do,
you're not losing anything;

37:12.722 --> 37:14.956
You're only gaining.

37:35.844 --> 37:37.978
<i>All rise.</i>

38:01.736 --> 38:02.669
I love you.

38:02.737 --> 38:03.937
I love you, too.

38:07.041 --> 38:08.808
You're my girl.

38:15.248 --> 38:17.617
<i>Family and friends,
i'd like to welcome you</i>

38:17.685 --> 38:21.354
<i>on behalf of Peter and Lou,
a very special couple.</i>

38:21.422 --> 38:23.656
Do you stand here now
and give yourselves

38:23.723 --> 38:25.857
to each other in marriage?

38:25.925 --> 38:27.660
We do.

38:27.727 --> 38:30.329
Who gives this woman
to be married to this man?

38:30.397 --> 38:31.463
I do.

38:34.133 --> 38:35.200
We do.

38:36.068 --> 38:37.135
Yeah. We do.

38:43.876 --> 38:47.178
<i>You may now repeat your vows.</i>

38:47.246 --> 38:49.714
I, Samantha Louise Fleming...

38:50.449 --> 38:52.684
<i>I Peter Walter Morris,</i>

38:52.752 --> 38:53.951
do take you...

38:54.019 --> 38:55.986
To be my husband...

38:56.054 --> 38:57.821
My constant friend...

38:57.889 --> 38:59.757
My partner...

38:59.824 --> 39:01.459
My faithful partner...

39:01.526 --> 39:03.327
And my one true love.

39:03.795 --> 39:06.397
And I will always be open...

39:06.465 --> 39:09.099
<i>And honest with you...</i>

39:09.167 --> 39:11.335
<i>And I will cherish you</i>

39:11.402 --> 39:13.403
for as long as we both
shall live.

39:13.471 --> 39:17.140
<i>For as long as we both
shall live.</i>

39:17.208 --> 39:19.276
Samantha Louise,

39:19.344 --> 39:22.879
<i>Do you take this man to be
your lawful, wedded husband?</i>

39:23.197 --> 39:24.898
I do.

39:24.966 --> 39:26.867
<i>Peter Walter,
do you take this woman</i>

39:26.934 --> 39:29.335
to be your lawful, wedded wife?

39:29.402 --> 39:31.136
I do.

39:31.204 --> 39:33.272
<i>The rings, please.</i>

39:39.079 --> 39:41.881
With this ring I thee wed.

39:45.318 --> 39:48.053
With this ring I thee wed.

39:49.355 --> 39:52.190
I proclaim you husband
and wife.

39:53.860 --> 39:54.993
You may kiss.

40:05.203 --> 40:10.207
<i>I present to you
Mr. and Mrs. Peter Morris.</i>

40:11.877 --> 40:14.278
<i>Grampa... it's fantastic.</i>

40:14.346 --> 40:15.846
The best for you, honey.

40:15.914 --> 40:16.847
I love you.

40:16.915 --> 40:17.981
I love you, too.

40:18.850 --> 40:19.616
Hop in.

40:19.684 --> 40:20.684
Okay.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.692
