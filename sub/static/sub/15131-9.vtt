WEBVTT

00:07.387 --> 00:10.022
Hey.

00:10.057 --> 00:11.890
You snuck out early this morning.

00:11.958 --> 00:14.427
I thought I'd come in,
sort through some stuff.

00:14.461 --> 00:16.762
Why? 'Cause my place doesn't have a desk?

00:16.796 --> 00:19.464
Or curtains? Or solitude of any kind?

00:19.498 --> 00:21.220
Your place is great.

00:21.377 --> 00:23.401
- I'm sorry. Is this private?
- No, no secret.

00:23.469 --> 00:26.438
I just have to figure out
what to do with my apartment.

00:26.472 --> 00:28.440
Alex, you know if you need
any money, I'll...

00:28.474 --> 00:30.442
No, I mean, yes, I do, but I-I don't.

00:30.476 --> 00:32.110
I'm fine. Thank you.

00:32.144 --> 00:33.545
Why don't you just dump it?

00:33.816 --> 00:35.647
- Dump it?
- Dump the apartment.

00:35.697 --> 00:37.582
Just get rid of the place.

00:37.649 --> 00:39.917
No? You could do something really nuts.

00:39.985 --> 00:42.495
You could move in with me.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.989
What are you laughing for? You
just said my place was great.

00:45.576 --> 00:46.924
- Oh, you're serious.
- Yeah.

00:46.992 --> 00:48.293
What would I do with all my nice things?

00:48.360 --> 00:50.661
Well, you could sell the nice things

00:50.696 --> 00:54.198
or you could store it or...
I don't know. I...

00:56.568 --> 00:58.836
You know what you could do?

00:58.904 --> 01:01.839
This might sound completely crazy.

01:01.907 --> 01:04.208
- What?
- Liberia.

01:04.275 --> 01:06.276
They're desperate for doctors
in Liberia, right?

01:06.311 --> 01:07.639
And you know what? There.

01:07.689 --> 01:11.159
We should totally go to Liberia.

01:11.716 --> 01:12.882
- Liberia?
- Yes.

01:12.950 --> 01:14.351
You just started working at a clinic here.

01:14.419 --> 01:15.468
And it'll still be here when I get back.

01:15.533 --> 01:16.500
But just hear me out, Alex,

01:16.550 --> 01:17.820
- one second here, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17.888 --> 01:19.689
They can really, really use people like us,

01:19.724 --> 01:22.759
and we could just go and give
ourselves to something amazing.

01:22.827 --> 01:24.804
There are amazing things here.

01:24.879 --> 01:27.036
Yes, there certainly are.

01:31.068 --> 01:32.836
Think about it.

01:35.982 --> 01:38.364
I'll put some pants on.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.044
Hey, Alex, it's your abandoned roomie

01:42.112 --> 01:43.679
calling from your deserted condo.

01:43.747 --> 01:45.648
I'm looking for that sweater you borrowed,

01:45.715 --> 01:47.350
the one that cost me two paychecks.

01:47.417 --> 01:50.686
I'm guessing it's lost in the land of Goran.

01:50.754 --> 01:54.790
Uh, can you just...
can you just call me? Thanks.

01:56.259 --> 02:00.362
All right.

02:05.139 --> 02:06.001
Okay.

02:06.069 --> 02:08.419
Huh.

02:09.906 --> 02:12.307
Wow. Charlie knew his rocks.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.868 --> 02:41.569
Anything else, Charlie?

02:41.603 --> 02:45.673
Yeah, what the hell, Rick?
Bloody mary, extra hot.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.808
You got it.

02:50.845 --> 02:53.814
Are you considering a purchase?

02:53.848 --> 02:56.817
Uh, what... me? Stocks? No, no, no.

02:56.851 --> 02:58.151
Somebody made off with the sports section.

02:58.186 --> 03:01.154
I'm just looking for something to read.

03:01.189 --> 03:02.823
Although apparently, um,

03:02.857 --> 03:06.126
IFC's second-quarter losses makes it a sell.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.795
Street says sell, I buy. I'm a contrarian.

03:08.830 --> 03:11.832
You should buy 1,000 shares right now.

03:11.866 --> 03:13.166
I would.

03:13.201 --> 03:15.202
The stock's in free fall.
You want me to buy it?

03:15.236 --> 03:19.171
Go out on a limb. That's where the fruit is.

03:26.213 --> 03:28.180
Here. Let me.

03:28.215 --> 03:29.849
Oh. Maggie, thank you.

03:29.883 --> 03:31.417
Uh-huh.

03:35.822 --> 03:37.422
Save the date.

03:37.490 --> 03:39.191
- For what?
- I'm getting married.

03:39.226 --> 03:43.129
Oh, I didn't realize you were engaged.

03:43.163 --> 03:44.529
Yeah, no, it just happened.

03:44.564 --> 03:46.899
Herschel and I have been
together almost 10 weeks, so...

03:46.933 --> 03:50.502
Wow. Ever heard of getting
to know one another?

03:50.536 --> 03:52.971
That's what a lifetime
of wedded bliss is for.

03:53.038 --> 03:55.540
Besides, there's no reason to wait.

03:55.575 --> 03:56.775
Mm, I can think of one.

03:56.809 --> 03:59.645
Wear a skirt,
cover your shoulders,

03:59.679 --> 04:02.013
and do something with that... hair.

04:06.452 --> 04:08.530
I need a pail of coffee.

04:08.744 --> 04:10.922
You know what?
We should probably make an appearance

04:10.956 --> 04:12.891
at Shahir's crepe fundraiser thing.

04:12.958 --> 04:14.292
No. No.

04:14.326 --> 04:16.459
I can smell them from here, and just no.

04:16.495 --> 04:18.629
- Oh.
- Selena?

04:18.664 --> 04:20.298
Yeah. I'll probably have to
call her back later.

04:20.332 --> 04:24.234
Oh, the obnoxious, kind-of-hot G.P.

04:24.303 --> 04:26.069
She's probably just calling
to say thank you for the ride.

04:26.137 --> 04:27.204
Really? You're still working with her

04:27.238 --> 04:28.339
after that whole knife-fight thing?

04:28.407 --> 04:29.390
- What?!
- Why would you even say that?

04:29.447 --> 04:31.342
- You didn't...
- I didn't know that you got into knife fights?

04:31.410 --> 04:32.543
No, neither did I.

04:32.577 --> 04:34.011
- Guys.
- Yeah?

04:34.078 --> 04:36.013
I need you to come with me right now.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.449
- What is it?
- Let's go.

04:41.352 --> 04:42.953
Oh, okay, k-k-keep the trowel spreader

04:43.021 --> 04:44.606
in the center of the skillet.

04:44.670 --> 04:46.523
It's a crepe, Shahir, not coq au vin.

04:46.590 --> 04:49.259
Melanda, there are 17 steps
in making a crepe.

04:49.294 --> 04:51.228
Try and get one of them right.

04:51.296 --> 04:53.730
- Okay. And we're done.
- Hmm?

04:53.798 --> 04:56.733
I love you, but your team skills stink.

04:56.801 --> 04:58.635
There is no "I" in "crepe."

04:58.669 --> 05:00.069
But there are two E's.

05:00.103 --> 05:02.405
Wait. Where are you going?
This is for cranial research.

05:02.473 --> 05:05.241
Maybe the ring went down a vent.
I don't know.

05:05.309 --> 05:08.277
I could call a fixer guy to check.

05:08.346 --> 05:09.779
- You mean like a handyman?
- Yeah.

05:09.847 --> 05:12.048
No way! What if he swipes it?

05:12.082 --> 05:14.383
Why did I even try it on?

05:14.451 --> 05:16.719
My advice? Just be straight up with Alex.

05:16.786 --> 05:18.787
She's cool. She'll get it.

05:18.822 --> 05:20.489
-
- Can you take over, please?

05:20.523 --> 05:22.825
Oh, yeah, of course.

05:25.462 --> 05:27.044
Medevac's on its way from the speedway.

05:27.151 --> 05:29.665
- Nathan Stewart is in it.
- Nate "The Rocket" Stewart?

05:29.733 --> 05:32.939
Mr. Stewart's car crashed
going 240 kilometers an hour.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.770
What's he doing racing?
I thought that guy was retired.

05:34.804 --> 05:36.338
- I guess he came out of retirement.
- Yeah.

05:36.373 --> 05:37.673
So, what are we looking at?

05:37.707 --> 05:38.874
We are looking at this.

05:39.942 --> 05:41.910
Oh.

05:41.978 --> 05:43.779
Oh. Ohh. Oh, my god.

05:43.813 --> 05:45.947
- Yeah.
- 240 kilometers an hour.

05:45.982 --> 05:47.615
How can anyone survive that?

05:47.649 --> 05:49.084
No! Oh, my god, Nate!

05:49.151 --> 05:51.519
Oh, my god!

06:01.964 --> 06:03.598
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, Nate.

06:03.632 --> 06:05.600
- I'm right here, baby. I'm right here.
- Miss? Excuse me, miss.

06:05.634 --> 06:07.101
No, I'm not leaving his side!

06:07.135 --> 06:08.770
Move, ma'am, or we can't work!

06:08.804 --> 06:10.505
Please. Oh, my god.

06:10.539 --> 06:11.839
Listen... is he on any medications?

06:11.874 --> 06:13.340
I-I don't know. I don't know.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.642
Listen. Look at me. Look at me.

06:14.676 --> 06:16.277
- Allergies? Illness? Anything?
- No, no.

06:16.311 --> 06:18.112
- I-I don't know! I don't know!
- Okay. Just... just stay back.

06:18.146 --> 06:19.346
Stay back, ma'am.

06:19.381 --> 06:21.349
Seatbelt bruising.
It doesn't look good.

06:21.399 --> 06:22.860
I hear bowel sounds in the chest.

06:22.910 --> 06:23.959
Could have a ruptured diaphragm.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.020
- I need to get in there and have a look.
- Ruptured what?!

06:26.054 --> 06:28.104
- Just stay back, please.
- He has another lung, only one brain.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.223
I need a C.T.

06:29.257 --> 06:33.894
Okay, extreme soft-tissue damage
and massive bone loss in here.

06:33.929 --> 06:35.329
Nate, can you feel this at all?

06:35.363 --> 06:37.297
Yeah, I can feel it.

06:37.364 --> 06:38.532
Good. That is good. All right.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.967
And I'm getting a thready pulse
on this side.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.969
Just don't... my...

06:43.003 --> 06:44.838
Nate?

06:44.872 --> 06:46.640
He's out.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.007
- Let's intubate him.
- Nora: What?

06:48.042 --> 06:49.476
His left pupil's dilated.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.545
Might be an epidural hematoma.
I need him in the O.R. now.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.878
If we don't move fast,
he's gonna lose his feet.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.747
Well, if he's brain-dead, it doesn't matter.

06:54.781 --> 06:55.881
Brain-dead?!

06:55.950 --> 06:57.417
Somebody, please tell me what's happening!

06:57.484 --> 06:58.985
Mr. Stewart might has bleeding on the brain.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.820
He's gonna need surgery
right now. Get her out of here.

07:00.887 --> 07:03.689
Oh, my god. We got to call Tawni.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.657
Let's go.

07:09.314 --> 07:12.496
Tissue intact, no herniation.

07:12.838 --> 07:14.564
How long have you had your implants?

07:14.599 --> 07:18.301
Three years. Do they seem lopsided to you?

07:19.771 --> 07:21.192
Um...

07:21.492 --> 07:23.372
No, perfectly symmetrical.

07:23.441 --> 07:25.509
Whoever did these did a good job.

07:25.576 --> 07:26.809
What about the pain?

07:26.844 --> 07:28.778
I think that's muscular.

07:28.846 --> 07:30.147
Oh, you're a personal trainer.

07:30.214 --> 07:31.648
I'd blame it on the chest presses.

07:31.715 --> 07:33.283
How many of those do you do in a day?

07:33.317 --> 07:34.618
As many as it takes.

07:34.685 --> 07:36.919
- That's what I tell my clients, anyway.
- Mm-hmm.

07:36.987 --> 07:38.888
"Temporary pain for permanent gain."

07:38.956 --> 07:40.089
Well, you've got the right attitude.

07:40.157 --> 07:41.223
You go ahead and get dressed.

07:45.162 --> 07:47.764
They're just not right.

07:47.831 --> 07:50.432
Um...

07:50.500 --> 07:53.036
If I wanted them out...?

07:53.103 --> 07:55.371
Well, uh...

07:55.438 --> 07:57.906
Women have implants removed all the time.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.074
It's hard, I bet.

07:59.142 --> 08:01.109
Not at all. It's an outpatient procedure.

08:01.178 --> 08:02.811
We just slice around the original scar,

08:02.879 --> 08:04.946
expose the implants,
pull them out... nothing to it.

08:05.014 --> 08:07.550
Great, then I think I want them out.

08:07.584 --> 08:09.985
But there's no medical reason
to have them removed,

08:10.053 --> 08:11.653
so it's cosmetic, which means...

08:11.721 --> 08:13.155
How much?

08:13.222 --> 08:14.322
About $6,000.

08:14.390 --> 08:15.490
Ouch.

08:15.524 --> 08:16.992
- Now, that hurts.
- Right.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.326
So, you go home. You think about it.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.428
You know where to find me.

08:27.002 --> 08:28.570
Did you call his manager... Roy?

08:28.604 --> 08:30.838
No. I haven't. No.

08:30.872 --> 08:32.273
These are the basics, Nora.

08:32.308 --> 08:34.658
Sorry. I-I completely forgot
I have to issue a statement.

08:34.707 --> 08:36.510
Did he have his lucky helmet?

08:36.544 --> 08:38.946
Yes. He did, sweetie. I promise.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.448
Then how did this happen?

08:40.482 --> 08:42.616
Okay, Rachel, honey, you go call grandpa,

08:42.650 --> 08:44.284
and you tell him not to watch the news

08:44.319 --> 08:45.986
and that I'm here with daddy now, okay?

08:46.021 --> 08:47.188
Okay.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.023
You must be Tawni.

08:49.057 --> 08:51.025
Yeah, uh, Nate's ex-wife.

08:51.059 --> 08:52.292
That's our daughter... Rachel.

08:52.327 --> 08:54.962
I'm Dr. Reid, and this is Dr. Goran.

08:54.996 --> 08:56.731
Your ex-husband is in the operating theater.

08:56.765 --> 08:58.099
I mean, he's in very good hands.

08:58.133 --> 09:00.667
I'm sure he is. I know the drill.

09:00.702 --> 09:02.469
He's had some extensive head trauma.

09:02.503 --> 09:05.004
- Um, let me guess... craniotomy?
- Craniectomy, actually.

09:05.039 --> 09:07.040
That's just like his first crash in '09.

09:07.074 --> 09:08.542
This is his third.

09:08.576 --> 09:10.877
Neurosurgeon's gonna find
screws in there already.

09:10.911 --> 09:13.647
Nate has recurring migraines,
so he takes aspirin daily.

09:13.681 --> 09:16.410
- That's a blood thinner.
- I'm not an idiot, Tawni.

09:16.464 --> 09:17.784
He has scar tissue on his arm and right leg.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.085
That's from the crash in Montreal.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.153
Okay, that's good to know.

09:20.187 --> 09:21.554
Look, his arms seem fine.

09:21.588 --> 09:23.556
We're actually more concerned
right now about his feet.

09:23.590 --> 09:24.891
He'll make it.

09:24.925 --> 09:26.993
- He always does.
- When will I get to see him?

09:27.027 --> 09:28.895
- You can see him when he's better.
- Look,

09:28.929 --> 09:30.529
I know you think
I'm just like the other girl...

09:30.564 --> 09:32.998
he has a Nora in every city, Nora.

09:33.032 --> 09:34.634
We are in love, Tawni.

09:34.668 --> 09:35.834
Well, that's just swell.

09:35.869 --> 09:37.336
Because while you're busy loving,

09:37.371 --> 09:38.638
I'm raising his daughter.

09:38.672 --> 09:39.805
You know, this is life.

09:39.873 --> 09:43.576
Love has nothing to do with it.

09:45.011 --> 09:46.044
Shahir's way behind.

09:46.079 --> 09:47.880
I'm losing my window on those feet.

09:47.914 --> 09:49.547
Don't worry. You'll make up the time.

09:49.582 --> 09:51.016
Yeah, fingers crossed.

09:51.084 --> 09:52.651
You know, they say the key to racing...

09:52.685 --> 09:54.552
you've got to believe
you're never gonna crash.

09:54.587 --> 09:56.521
Guess that's why he keeps
coming out of retirement.

09:56.589 --> 09:57.823
That dude lives on the edge.

09:57.857 --> 09:59.391
Man, you got to respect that about him.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.605
Did you not see how worried his daughter is?

10:01.655 --> 10:02.379
Yeah, I mean, okay,

10:02.454 --> 10:04.329
clearly he's a guy
who believes he's invincible,

10:04.363 --> 10:06.631
but, I mean, his daughter's not
about to change that, is she?

10:06.699 --> 10:08.466
Come on. I mean... I mean, I think he's...

10:08.534 --> 10:12.003
he's a guy who...
wants to have it all, right?

10:12.037 --> 10:13.971
He can, just not at the same time.

10:15.541 --> 10:17.809
How is he not done yet? Shahir!

10:17.876 --> 10:20.478
- It's taking longer than I thought, Joel.
- Yes.

10:20.546 --> 10:23.380
- Alex, Sharpe is having trouble ventilating.
- How much trouble?

10:23.448 --> 10:24.675
Respiratory pressure keeps falling.

10:24.732 --> 10:26.913
- I'm doing what I can.
- His breathing must be compromised.

10:26.963 --> 10:27.881
Joel, I'm gonna have to jump the queue

10:27.931 --> 10:29.021
- and open this guy up.
- What, right now?

10:29.102 --> 10:30.788
Well, he's not gonna care about
his feet if he can't breathe.

10:30.856 --> 10:33.432
Yeah, I understand that,
but we're losing time here.

10:33.482 --> 10:34.391
Page Dr. Lin.

10:34.459 --> 10:35.726
I'm gonna be in and out in 20 minutes flat.

10:35.794 --> 10:37.061
Make it 15, please.

10:37.129 --> 10:39.396
- Let me see this.
- I'll go speak to the wife,

10:39.464 --> 10:42.733
ex-girlfriend, daughter... the women.

10:45.670 --> 10:47.771
No one's gonna stop driving anytime soon,

10:47.839 --> 10:49.105
so oil pipelines.

10:49.173 --> 10:50.941
Okay, what else?

10:51.008 --> 10:52.609
Copper, aluminum.

10:52.677 --> 10:55.278
The mining sector should be
in your portfolio for sure.

10:55.346 --> 10:57.780
Is there anything even moderately ethical?

10:57.849 --> 11:00.116
That makes money? No.

11:00.184 --> 11:02.452
Everything else is just gambling.

11:02.519 --> 11:04.921
Pharmaceutical stocks, maybe?

11:04.989 --> 11:06.422
Uh, yeah, I'm not comfortable with that.

11:06.457 --> 11:09.625
I'm a... I'm a doctor, so it's
"conflict of interest."

11:09.693 --> 11:11.627
So put all of your money in solar power

11:11.695 --> 11:13.763
and retire when you're 90.

11:15.499 --> 11:17.767
My stepdad was a doctor.

11:17.835 --> 11:19.669
He bought a boat and died penniless.

11:19.703 --> 11:21.537
I consider this a public service.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.242
How much longer you staying here?

11:26.309 --> 11:29.945
Oh, I, um... I live here, at the, uh, hotel.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.606
Sometimes I feel like I live in hotels, too.

11:32.656 --> 11:33.414
Travel a lot?

11:33.483 --> 11:36.585
One of the perks of being in private equity.

11:36.619 --> 11:38.354
I go from place to place,

11:38.388 --> 11:40.822
looking for underperforming companies.

11:40.891 --> 11:43.492
- Fixer-uppers.
- Or teardowns.

11:43.559 --> 11:45.460
I basically bet on the future.

11:45.495 --> 11:47.128
That sounds interesting.

11:47.162 --> 11:48.797
But hard on a marriage.

11:48.831 --> 11:53.034
Are you... married?

11:53.507 --> 11:55.771
Oh, of course not. You're living in a hotel.

11:55.805 --> 11:59.708
Uh, no, actually, I'm... I-I was.

12:00.436 --> 12:01.297
Um...

12:01.347 --> 12:02.810
It's complicated.

12:02.844 --> 12:03.751
Yeah.

12:05.038 --> 12:06.605
It's complicated.

12:06.982 --> 12:09.126
Left lung isn't inflating properly.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.036
- How are his SATs?
- Nothing unusual.

12:11.229 --> 12:13.521
It's not the heart, then.

12:15.057 --> 12:17.691
Whoa, his stomach is up in the chest.

12:17.726 --> 12:19.293
Can you retract proximally?

12:19.327 --> 12:21.161
Yep.

12:22.497 --> 12:24.064
Alex, problem.

12:24.345 --> 12:26.066
Whoa, where is that blood coming from?

12:26.100 --> 12:28.068
Okay, I got to get a closer look here.

12:28.102 --> 12:29.670
Patient's tachycardic.

12:29.704 --> 12:31.038
B.P. dropping. What's going on?

12:31.072 --> 12:34.207
I don't know, but it's not good.

12:34.242 --> 12:35.375
Doctor!

12:35.410 --> 12:37.044
Uh, doctor!

12:37.078 --> 12:38.378
Get me a stretcher.

12:38.413 --> 12:40.713
- What's happening here?
- Uh, I found her near her car.

12:40.748 --> 12:42.215
Okay, come here.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.550
Bleeding, right upper quadrant.

12:43.584 --> 12:45.819
Looks like a possible stab wound.

12:47.121 --> 12:50.090
Uh, I found this on the ground.
Is it important?

12:51.792 --> 12:53.259
It's her breast implant.

12:53.293 --> 12:55.161
Her what?

12:55.195 --> 12:56.863
Who did this to you? Were you attacked?

12:56.897 --> 13:00.500
No. I did it myself.

13:00.568 --> 13:02.368
You what?

13:02.402 --> 13:07.039
Dr. Kinney told me how... nothing to it.

13:07.074 --> 13:08.707
Oh!

13:08.741 --> 13:12.011
Okay, get... ready? Let's go, on three.

13:20.397 --> 13:21.998
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:22.033 --> 13:23.199
What do you got?

13:23.233 --> 13:24.667
- A patient of yours...
- Uh-huh.

13:24.734 --> 13:26.465
Cut out her own breast implant.

13:27.597 --> 13:28.704
Excuse me?

13:28.738 --> 13:30.439
She said you talked her
through the procedure.

13:30.507 --> 13:32.610
I most certainly did not.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.108
Who's operating on her?

13:34.178 --> 13:35.444
Dr. Storms.

13:35.512 --> 13:37.680
Oh, well, she had a better
chance of doing it herself.

13:37.747 --> 13:39.014
- I'm gonna talk to her.
- Sure.

13:39.082 --> 13:40.515
After she's all stitched up,

13:40.583 --> 13:42.663
you can find her on the ninth floor.

13:42.795 --> 13:44.720
Yeah, I know what's on the ninth floor, Zach.

13:44.788 --> 13:46.722
Do you want me to page Dr. Dey?

13:46.790 --> 13:48.891
No, I can handle this.

13:49.993 --> 13:52.460
Yeah, psych ward, Zach. Got it.

13:55.198 --> 13:57.299
How's that diaphragm, doctors?

13:57.366 --> 13:58.900
Stomach's reduced.

13:58.967 --> 14:01.236
- Suctioned the air out of the chest.
- Okay, great.

14:01.304 --> 14:02.737
Uh, ask them to re-drape
for the feet. I'll scrub up.

14:02.771 --> 14:05.740
No, not yet. Not yet. Okay.

14:05.808 --> 14:07.861
- Damn it. I think I found it.
- Splenic rupture.

14:07.943 --> 14:10.078
- Yep.
- So, pack it and let me at those feet.

14:10.145 --> 14:11.413
I can't. I have to take the spleen out.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.716
That's gonna be at least
another 30 minutes, Alex.

14:12.777 --> 14:15.073
Well, then it's gonna be another 30 minutes.

14:16.585 --> 14:18.186
Page me when you're done.

14:19.722 --> 14:21.856
What I'd give even for a test drive.

14:21.890 --> 14:24.158
You serious? That's not even a sport.

14:24.226 --> 14:27.061
They're just driving around
in circles for hours.

14:27.129 --> 14:29.062
You know they don't even stop
for washroom breaks?

14:29.097 --> 14:31.398
I'd deal.

14:31.466 --> 14:34.401
I drove on the autobahn once,
got it up to 200 kilometers.

14:34.436 --> 14:35.736
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:35.770 --> 14:37.904
Man, it was good.
Imagine getting paid for that?

14:37.939 --> 14:39.607
Like I said, the man got rich

14:39.641 --> 14:41.742
having to sit in his own piss all day.

14:41.776 --> 14:43.611
Let me see that imaging again.

14:43.678 --> 14:45.612
Hey. What are you doing down here?

14:45.646 --> 14:46.865
Ran into some ventilation issues.

14:46.943 --> 14:49.182
- We'll make up the time.
- Do those feet have the time?

14:49.532 --> 14:51.551
Less than they had five minutes ago.

14:51.585 --> 14:52.886
What is... when was that?

14:52.920 --> 14:55.222
His crash in '09.

14:55.815 --> 14:57.390
Wow.

14:57.424 --> 14:59.226
That guy just gets up and walks away.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.561
- It's insane.
- Dude, his arm's on fire.

15:01.595 --> 15:04.063
He's... a machine.

15:04.097 --> 15:06.399
So, you agree with me,
or you sticking with Dr. Miller?

15:06.433 --> 15:09.902
Nate Stewart...
money, fame, cars, nine lives.

15:09.936 --> 15:12.972
That man's got the life, right?

15:17.144 --> 15:19.444
Wait till you have kids.

15:19.479 --> 15:21.013
- What?
- You'll see. It all changes.

15:21.047 --> 15:23.215
You'll do anything you can
to stay alive for your kids.

15:23.250 --> 15:26.285
Hello. I have my snakes.

15:28.822 --> 15:30.455
Yeah. So you get it.

15:35.628 --> 15:37.596
- Herschel.
- Hey.

15:37.630 --> 15:38.764
What are you doing here?

15:38.798 --> 15:40.332
I just wanted to see where you work

15:40.366 --> 15:42.000
and, uh, bring you lunch.

15:42.034 --> 15:44.636
This is... a surprise.

15:44.671 --> 15:47.572
I am full of surprises.

15:50.343 --> 15:52.143
Ohh. Egg salad.

15:52.178 --> 15:55.546
I'm, uh... I'm allergic to eggs.

15:55.614 --> 15:57.916
Oh. Wow. I did not know that.

15:58.132 --> 15:58.906
Yeah.

15:58.956 --> 15:59.677
No, if I eat them,

15:59.727 --> 16:02.812
I go into anaphylactic shock and die, so...

16:03.012 --> 16:05.356
Well at least you'd be
in the right place, though, right?

16:05.390 --> 16:06.825
You know?

16:06.892 --> 16:08.492
"Ugh!"

16:10.595 --> 16:12.330
Thank you for the thought.

16:12.397 --> 16:13.997
Um, I'll just grab something later.

16:14.065 --> 16:15.399
I should probably get back.

16:15.434 --> 16:16.701
Oh, yes. Right.

16:16.768 --> 16:17.768
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:17.803 --> 16:19.370
- Yes. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

16:19.438 --> 16:21.905
Oh, um...

16:21.940 --> 16:24.241
Do you eat tuna?

16:24.275 --> 16:27.044
Just future reference, sandwich-wise.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.412
I like a nice BLT.

16:31.049 --> 16:32.216
I'm just kidding.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.516
Right.

16:33.584 --> 16:35.418
Okay.

16:35.486 --> 16:37.420
That's good.

16:37.488 --> 16:38.755
- All right.
- Okay.

16:38.823 --> 16:41.090
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

16:41.158 --> 16:43.593
Hey doctor "G,"
if you need to take five,

16:43.661 --> 16:45.628
- I can totally, uh...
- I'm not tired. I'm just waiting.

16:45.663 --> 16:46.896
No, I hear you.

16:46.964 --> 16:50.367
Nate Stewart... that's not textbook.

16:50.434 --> 16:51.568
Is she almost done?

16:51.635 --> 16:53.903
Mm. Closing.

16:53.971 --> 16:57.740
Okay, so, hypothetically,

16:57.807 --> 17:01.577
a seemingly hetero girl
kisses a hetero girl.

17:01.644 --> 17:03.246
It's got to mean something, right?

17:03.313 --> 17:04.747
Sexual fluidity.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.049
It's a thing.

17:08.285 --> 17:09.550
All right, so, who did you kiss?

17:09.618 --> 17:11.420
Oh, come on, Lin.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.122
It's obvious you're talking specifics.

17:13.190 --> 17:15.190
Sometimes a kiss can mean nothing.

17:15.258 --> 17:17.025
Kind of like the whole time we dated.

17:17.059 --> 17:18.694
- Wow. Ouch.
- Oh.

17:18.728 --> 17:20.561
Wait. You two?

17:20.630 --> 17:24.232
Yeah, and Joel and Heidi...
And Joel and Dana.

17:24.267 --> 17:25.467
Dana?

17:25.535 --> 17:29.137
You and Dana? Really? Like Dana, Dana?

17:29.205 --> 17:31.506
Well, talk about a grand slam.

17:33.475 --> 17:35.576
Spleen's out.

17:35.644 --> 17:37.078
Sharpe's putting in a center line.

17:37.146 --> 17:39.915
- Then you're up.
- I'm on it.

17:39.982 --> 17:42.483
Ugh, Shahir, this place is
gonna smell like crepes forever.

17:42.518 --> 17:43.952
They're practically odorless.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.653
Well, they're making me feel like "crepe."

17:47.088 --> 17:48.623
What is with you?

17:50.592 --> 17:53.561
The doctor was able to
remove the other implant

17:53.629 --> 17:56.063
without too much damage
to the surrounding tissue,

17:56.097 --> 17:58.065
but you got lucky.

17:58.099 --> 18:00.735
Thank you.

18:00.769 --> 18:03.103
Can you help me with my pillows?

18:03.138 --> 18:06.106
Megan, what you did was beyond reckless.

18:06.141 --> 18:09.276
Now, if I had known
how desperate you were...

18:09.311 --> 18:13.948
I had to. I-I don't have $6,000.

18:13.982 --> 18:16.283
Yes, but your breasts were fine.

18:17.452 --> 18:19.853
There. Is that better with the pillows?

18:20.888 --> 18:24.123
Yes. Thanks.

18:24.158 --> 18:25.792
You know what I think?

18:25.827 --> 18:27.727
I think this isn't about the breasts.

18:29.196 --> 18:31.164
Do you want to tell me
what's really going on?

18:33.468 --> 18:35.101
He bought them for me.

18:35.135 --> 18:37.103
"He" being your boyfriend?

18:37.137 --> 18:39.705
- My ex.
- Mm.

18:39.739 --> 18:43.709
He told me I looked like a boy.

18:43.743 --> 18:48.381
Yeah, he was a real catch.

18:48.415 --> 18:51.017
He gave me bruises bigger
than these will ever be.

18:53.019 --> 18:54.487
I'm sorry.

18:54.521 --> 18:57.255
I finally got him out of my life.

18:59.225 --> 19:02.528
It was... so hard.

19:02.562 --> 19:06.031
And then every time
you looked at yourself...

19:06.099 --> 19:09.134
All I could think about was him.

19:09.202 --> 19:11.970
It's okay.

19:12.038 --> 19:14.873
You're okay now. You're in a safe place.

19:16.275 --> 19:19.211
I'm in the loony bin, yo.

19:19.278 --> 19:22.280
H-how long do I have to be in here?

19:22.348 --> 19:23.648
It'll be a while.

19:23.682 --> 19:26.484
I'm-I'm afraid we
take self-harm very seriously.

19:26.519 --> 19:28.786
I don't belong here.

19:28.854 --> 19:31.723
I'm not crazy.

19:35.060 --> 19:36.494
All you need is an online brokerage,

19:36.562 --> 19:38.329
- and you are all set.
- No, you convinced me.

19:38.397 --> 19:40.331
- I'm gonna... I'm gonna do this.
- Nice.

19:40.399 --> 19:42.400
I pegged you as more of a bull than a bear,

19:42.434 --> 19:44.902
except for the whole
"it's complicated" thing.

19:44.969 --> 19:46.770
That is no way to get the girl.

19:46.838 --> 19:48.772
Okay, well, how do I do that?
How do I get the girl?

19:48.840 --> 19:51.275
- Really?
- Yeah. Give me the hot tip.

19:51.309 --> 19:52.743
You want a little insider trading?

19:52.810 --> 19:54.078
- Absolutely.
- Okay. Okay.

19:54.146 --> 19:56.247
Well, for starters, um...

19:56.314 --> 19:58.949
Look lonesome, not lonely.

19:59.017 --> 20:01.251
Lonesome... okay, I'm gonna write this down.

20:01.318 --> 20:02.419
This is... this is good stuff. Go ahead.

20:02.486 --> 20:04.120
And lead with the doctor thing.

20:04.188 --> 20:06.222
- Lead with the doctor.
- And, um...

20:06.290 --> 20:09.026
come up.

20:09.093 --> 20:10.861
What?

20:10.929 --> 20:12.295
Come up to my room.

20:12.363 --> 20:14.731
Come up now.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.635
I-I really can't.

20:19.703 --> 20:21.804
Room 1501.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.573
You should really come up.

20:37.187 --> 20:40.089
Better hurry. SATs are dropping.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.758
That should just about do it
for the dead tissue in here.

20:42.793 --> 20:44.359
And we're just under the wire
with this thing.

20:44.427 --> 20:45.761
All right, let's bring in the ex fix,

20:45.796 --> 20:47.663
and let's reset this open
fracture in here, all right?

20:49.265 --> 20:51.567
Hold up a second.

20:53.603 --> 20:56.738
Okay, this changes everything.

20:56.772 --> 21:00.242
He's got motor oil on his bones.

21:02.645 --> 21:04.413
Yeah, and whatever the, uh...

21:04.447 --> 21:06.294
the lady had,
just put in on my bill, as well.

21:06.355 --> 21:06.914
Lady?

21:06.983 --> 21:09.217
Yeah, that woman that I was talking to.

21:09.251 --> 21:11.119
I didn't see any lady with you.

21:11.153 --> 21:15.056
I-I thought you were one
of those bluetooth gentlemen.

21:32.141 --> 21:33.374
Hello?!

21:34.943 --> 21:37.745
Hello!

21:37.779 --> 21:40.247
Hey, listen, I need you
to open this room for me.

21:40.281 --> 21:42.249
- I'm sorry, sir. I can't do that.
- Listen, I'm a doctor.

21:42.283 --> 21:42.963
It could be an emergency.

21:43.023 --> 21:44.569
There could be a woman
in trouble in that room, okay?

21:44.662 --> 21:46.887
I don't care. I could get fired.

21:46.921 --> 21:48.488
Hey, what are you doing? Stop it!

21:48.523 --> 21:51.091
That's my key. Give it back to me.

22:11.912 --> 22:15.447
Yeah, I need an ambulance,
the Browning Suites, room 1501.

22:22.217 --> 22:23.609
Charlie. Here. What do you got?

22:23.677 --> 22:24.558
I think she's having a miscarriage.

22:24.608 --> 22:26.379
She's lost a lot of blood.
Did you page Dr. Katz?

22:26.413 --> 22:28.313
I did. Let's get a bolus of ringers,

22:28.348 --> 22:29.982
and someone get on the horn
to the blood bank.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.751
- Charlie, what can you tell me?
- Uh, not much.

22:31.818 --> 22:32.985
She was unconscious when I found her.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.319
She a friend of yours?

22:34.354 --> 22:36.021
Yeah, um... not really.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.323
Well, whoever she is, she has
a class-4 placental abruption.

22:38.391 --> 22:41.360
Clear an O.R.
I need to get her in right away.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.969
The sooner we go in, we can prevent it.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.970
How did he get motor oil in his bones?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.639
Oil kept running into his open fracture.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.526
It's in his bone marrow.

22:55.618 --> 22:57.409
If we don't get it out fast, he's gonna die.

22:57.476 --> 22:58.549
What if you used castile soap

22:58.599 --> 23:00.219
and mixed it with the sterile saline bags?

23:00.285 --> 23:01.525
That would emulsify the motor oil.

23:01.575 --> 23:03.684
Exactly, then we power
through it with the jet lavage.

23:03.734 --> 23:04.586
Wait. Wait. Wait. That kind of pressure...

23:04.636 --> 23:06.150
that could destroy his soft tissue,

23:06.218 --> 23:08.630
not to mention the infection from the oil.
He could go septic.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.120
There is still time before his feet are dead.

23:10.188 --> 23:11.006
Uh, do me a favor.

23:11.087 --> 23:12.903
Go and get any help you can,
anyone's who's available.

23:12.973 --> 23:15.259
- More manpower. Got it.
- No, no, no, that's not gonna be enough.

23:15.327 --> 23:16.760
It will if we move now.

23:16.795 --> 23:19.063
- Joel, we need to prepare the family.
- Prepare them for what?

23:19.131 --> 23:20.731
That we're gonna try and save his feet?

23:20.799 --> 23:22.866
That we probably won't be able to.

23:25.603 --> 23:27.538
Prep the jet lavage. Start now.

23:27.572 --> 23:28.772
On it like a bonnet.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.548
I know that look.

23:37.615 --> 23:39.215
Oil from the engine has leaked
into your husband's...

23:39.283 --> 23:41.552
I'm sorry... your ex-husband's bones.

23:41.619 --> 23:43.053
Uh, we're flushing them now.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.055
However, there is still

23:45.089 --> 23:47.357
extensive tissue damage in those feet.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.559
So you want to cut them off.

23:49.593 --> 23:52.228
That's where you're going
with this, aren't you?

23:52.263 --> 23:53.263
That is one option, yes.

23:53.297 --> 23:55.932
Amputation could save his life.

23:55.967 --> 23:58.101
Or we could continue working,

23:58.135 --> 24:00.636
and we could save his life and his feet.

24:00.671 --> 24:03.272
Look, there's still viable tissue in there,

24:03.306 --> 24:04.440
so we could restore the blood flow.

24:04.475 --> 24:05.608
But even if we are able to do that,

24:05.676 --> 24:08.110
Nate still faces a long recovery,

24:08.144 --> 24:10.580
multiple surgeries,
and years of chronic pain.

24:10.614 --> 24:14.416
Damn it, Nathan.

24:14.451 --> 24:16.551
There are great prosthetics out there.

24:16.586 --> 24:18.720
Amputation is a viable option.

24:18.754 --> 24:20.055
No way.

24:20.090 --> 24:21.756
- Amputation? Are you out of your mind?
- Nora.

24:21.791 --> 24:22.892
Okay, let's just try to stay calm, and we'll...

24:22.947 --> 24:25.292
Who's gonna stay calm when
you're talking about amputating his feet?

24:25.342 --> 24:26.407
Nora!

24:27.137 --> 24:28.830
He'd hate us for giving up.

24:28.865 --> 24:30.699
We're not giving up. Are you listening?

24:30.733 --> 24:32.934
I don't want him to suffer
for the next 20 years.

24:33.349 --> 24:36.505
- What's going on? Is dad okay?
- Yeah.

24:36.539 --> 24:38.172
Mama's got it, babe.

24:38.207 --> 24:40.241
Tawni, please.

24:40.275 --> 24:43.812
Look me in the eyes.
Tell me this is what he'd want.

24:49.851 --> 24:54.022
What if we try the other way?

24:54.056 --> 24:56.790
We know the concerns.

24:56.825 --> 24:58.726
Could he race again?

25:01.196 --> 25:02.830
Possibly.

25:02.864 --> 25:04.765
Yeah.

25:06.735 --> 25:08.002
- You're serious?
- It's his third crash.

25:08.036 --> 25:09.136
No doctor's ever taken his legs,

25:09.203 --> 25:10.437
and I don't want to be the first.

25:10.505 --> 25:11.972
No, wait, Joel, is this about
you or the patient?

25:12.007 --> 25:13.807
It's always about the patient.

25:13.842 --> 25:15.976
- I'm not so sure.
- How can you even say that? Listen to me.

25:16.961 --> 25:18.933
Look, it's because it's him, all right?

25:18.983 --> 25:19.865
You don't know him.

25:19.915 --> 25:21.781
I know who he is,
and I get this guy, all right?

25:21.815 --> 25:23.650
We need to do everything we can.

25:23.684 --> 25:27.120
What about the family?
What's right for them?

25:27.188 --> 25:29.456
This is my field of expertise.

25:29.490 --> 25:31.458
I believe it's gonna work.

25:32.863 --> 25:34.110
Okay.

25:38.666 --> 25:41.065
She's not crazy. She did a very crazy thing.

25:41.115 --> 25:42.134
She won't do it again.

25:42.169 --> 25:44.336
She's freshly out
of an abusive relationship...

25:44.404 --> 25:45.129
traumatized.

25:45.213 --> 25:46.606
I mean, it was an act
of desperation. It's...

25:46.674 --> 25:47.674
- She told you that?
- Yes.

25:47.708 --> 25:48.975
She told it all to me just now.

25:49.043 --> 25:50.643
And, frankly, I feel somewhat responsible.

25:50.711 --> 25:52.144
I didn't see this in the consultation.

25:52.212 --> 25:54.080
Well, I guess you weren't looking for it.

25:54.147 --> 25:55.747
Well, I'm seeing it now,
and I think it's cruel

25:55.815 --> 25:57.550
to keep her on a locked ward
without all the facts.

25:57.617 --> 25:58.684
Oh, she had lots of facts.

25:58.718 --> 26:00.419
You told her how to cut her boob off.

26:00.782 --> 26:01.798
Oh.

26:02.077 --> 26:04.390
I see. You have a problem
with plastic surgery. Right.

26:04.458 --> 26:06.896
Promotes low self-esteem,
is bad for a woman's image.

26:06.946 --> 26:08.727
- I get it.
- You've been thinking a lot about this, eh?

26:08.795 --> 26:10.010
You know, I do a lot of surgeries,

26:10.060 --> 26:12.112
just as I'm sure
you see mildly unhappy people

26:12.193 --> 26:14.123
who just want to talk about themselves.

26:14.211 --> 26:17.188
I-I mean, obviously, Megan needs therapy.

26:17.238 --> 26:18.137
I just think that...

26:18.236 --> 26:20.105
that committing her is a step too far.

26:20.172 --> 26:22.808
- Okay, I'll go talk to her.
- Thank you.

26:29.650 --> 26:31.216
Here you go, boss.

26:31.283 --> 26:33.751
We salvaged what we could,
some cartilage, too, but, um...

26:33.819 --> 26:35.686
That's all that's left of the foot?

26:35.754 --> 26:38.256
Yeah. That's all I could save.

26:38.290 --> 26:40.691
What now?

26:45.246 --> 26:46.747
Okay, so, the plan is to

26:46.781 --> 26:48.349
re-implant the articular pieces.

26:48.416 --> 26:50.684
Then we use the rest to template the foot,

26:50.719 --> 26:52.353
and then we discard them.

26:52.387 --> 26:54.187
So, there's the cuboid.

26:54.222 --> 26:56.523
Articular cartilage we got there,

26:56.591 --> 26:58.803
and these are the proximal phalanges here.

26:58.853 --> 27:00.026
Could you just put that one at the front?

27:00.061 --> 27:01.361
- Mm-hmm.
- Yep.

27:01.395 --> 27:02.863
There's got to be at least
two dozen bones here.

27:02.897 --> 27:04.464
At least they are here.

27:05.285 --> 27:06.532
Why don't I, uh, suture the cadaver skin

27:06.567 --> 27:08.701
onto this foot while you rebuild that one?

27:08.736 --> 27:10.203
Sounds like a plan.

27:10.238 --> 27:12.038
Pick-ups.

27:17.244 --> 27:19.545
You're still thinking about
the Dana thing, aren't you?

27:19.580 --> 27:21.280
I'm thinking about the patient.

27:21.314 --> 27:22.782
It's all right if you are.

27:22.816 --> 27:24.784
You can continue to think about that.

27:24.818 --> 27:26.886
No, I'm fine. I wasn't even in the picture.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.654
Mm-hmm.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.655
That's all, though, right?

27:29.690 --> 27:31.823
- Hmm?
- Dana, Maggie, Heidi.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.359
No more surprises.

27:33.393 --> 27:35.460
No more surprises.

27:39.499 --> 27:42.843
Hey. Promise.

27:54.386 --> 27:56.381
Dr. Murphy... did he leave
a forwarding number?

27:56.416 --> 27:58.082
I need his opinion on a former patient.

27:58.117 --> 28:00.585
Oh, a dirty mug, some files, but no number.

28:00.620 --> 28:03.087
I don't think he was keen on being found.

28:14.834 --> 28:16.751
So, I-I read your paper on LSD.

28:16.801 --> 28:18.236
So, you're interested in hallucinations.

28:18.270 --> 28:19.437
Mm-hmm.

28:19.471 --> 28:22.863
Um... well, I might have a patient for you.

28:22.913 --> 28:24.007
A referral?

28:24.075 --> 28:25.208
Uh, sort of.

28:25.243 --> 28:26.544
Me.

28:27.701 --> 28:29.048
See, um,

28:29.414 --> 28:30.383
occasionally

28:30.520 --> 28:35.018
I see things that, uh, you could refer to
as hallucinations.

28:35.086 --> 28:37.887
Well, there's a theory
that in the bronze age,

28:37.922 --> 28:42.059
hallucinations were just a way
for the brain to talk to itself.

28:42.126 --> 28:44.127
Right. So I have a caveman brain.

28:44.162 --> 28:46.529
You have an interesting brain.

28:49.593 --> 28:50.900
Well, today I couldn't tell the difference

28:50.969 --> 28:54.370
between what was real and what wasn't.

28:55.949 --> 28:57.574
Sounds like a bit of an unfurling.

28:57.608 --> 29:00.477
Um... any big changes recently?

29:03.447 --> 29:07.784
All right, Sharpe,
how's our patient holding up?

29:07.852 --> 29:09.785
Mean arterial pressure's hovering around 80.

29:09.819 --> 29:12.621
That is music to my ears.

29:12.655 --> 29:14.256
So, what are you gonna say to the family

29:14.324 --> 29:15.391
if things don't work out?

29:15.459 --> 29:16.925
I don't really think about

29:16.960 --> 29:19.228
any conversation till I have to, Alex.

29:19.296 --> 29:21.230
It's important to find the right words.

29:22.942 --> 29:23.863
Alex,

29:24.740 --> 29:28.684
a guy like Nate wakes up,
you know what he's gonna ask?

29:28.796 --> 29:30.937
He's gonna say,
"when am I gonna race again?"

29:30.987 --> 29:32.161
Not "if," but "when."

29:32.395 --> 29:33.842
That's what these guys are like.

29:33.910 --> 29:35.343
Those are gonna be the words.

29:35.411 --> 29:37.779
That is gonna be the conversation.

29:37.814 --> 29:39.815
He could have been brought
to a different hospital,

29:39.883 --> 29:41.650
different doctors
who made different choices.

29:42.615 --> 29:45.316
It just makes you realize
how random everything is.

29:45.477 --> 29:47.331
Anything smaller on your mind, Dr. Reid?

29:47.713 --> 29:48.956
Just thinking.

29:57.615 --> 29:59.362
- Oh, hey, you paged me.
- Hey. Yeah.

29:59.412 --> 30:01.201
So, listen, a buddy of mine from the general

30:01.269 --> 30:03.538
heard about the whole
parking-lot boob thing.

30:03.605 --> 30:05.706
Will people stop saying "boob"?

30:06.235 --> 30:08.066
Sorry. Yeah. Your buddy from the general.

30:08.116 --> 30:10.291
Right, so, your patient is a frequent flyer.

30:10.963 --> 30:12.613
- Megan?
- Yeah.

30:12.663 --> 30:14.732
Good thing she's up in the old...

30:14.782 --> 30:16.850
If you're talking about Megan,
she's being discharged right now.

30:16.884 --> 30:17.482
Ugh.

30:17.532 --> 30:19.452
And the whole crazy whistling thing is disrespectful.

30:19.487 --> 30:20.954
- You discharged her?
- On my advice.

30:20.988 --> 30:22.322
What's the deal here, Zach?

30:22.357 --> 30:24.525
You have been mightily, mightily snowed.

30:24.559 --> 30:26.360
Run, children, run.

30:27.662 --> 30:30.197
Oh, give me the damn chart.

30:30.542 --> 30:33.488
You experienced a rare
complication of pregnancy.

30:33.538 --> 30:36.169
The placenta became detached
from the uterus.

30:36.203 --> 30:38.204
It can happen suddenly, without warning.

30:38.238 --> 30:39.873
What about my baby?

30:40.706 --> 30:44.377
I'm sorry. The fetus didn't survive.

30:47.018 --> 30:48.984
It's my fault.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.317
I never should have gotten on that plane.

30:51.351 --> 30:53.719
No, flying didn't cause your miscarriage.

30:54.110 --> 30:55.598
It sometimes just...

30:55.855 --> 30:56.721
happens.

30:57.532 --> 30:59.192
There's nothing you could have done.

30:59.226 --> 31:02.462
Your husband's on a plane now.
He's on his way.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.834
You're the doctor who found me?

31:08.868 --> 31:11.503
Uh... yeah.

31:11.537 --> 31:14.172
Um, I heard you calling out.

31:14.207 --> 31:16.108
Thank you.

31:19.879 --> 31:22.180
How am I supposed to get through this?

31:22.720 --> 31:25.474
I know it seems impossible right now, but...

31:26.519 --> 31:27.586
you will.

31:27.620 --> 31:28.920
How do you know?

31:29.671 --> 31:31.436
I don't know. You, uh...

31:31.790 --> 31:33.449
you bet on the future, I guess.

31:36.997 --> 31:39.463
That sounds like the kind
of advice I would give.

31:43.847 --> 31:45.769
Did you buy the stock?

31:48.849 --> 31:49.917
I'm sorry?

31:51.576 --> 31:54.345
Never mind. I...

31:54.996 --> 31:57.734
It must have been a dream...

31:58.116 --> 32:00.733
'cause I feel like we've met before.

32:02.687 --> 32:05.389
Forget it.

32:06.953 --> 32:08.292
Okay.

32:10.928 --> 32:12.362
Why do we always end up going

32:12.429 --> 32:15.398
through the worst experiences
of our lives when we're alone?

32:16.683 --> 32:18.468
You're not alone.

32:25.877 --> 32:28.311
Uh, Megan...

32:28.345 --> 32:30.680
I see you had a bike accident last year.

32:31.406 --> 32:34.284
Yeah, I-I ran into a parked car,
broke my nose.

32:34.351 --> 32:36.786
Uh-huh, and the year before,

32:36.853 --> 32:38.621
you had jaw surgery to correct an underbite?

32:38.656 --> 32:40.856
Yeah, I had a hard time closing my mouth.

32:41.111 --> 32:43.575
You've had a lot of unlucky breaks, Megan.

32:44.118 --> 32:45.928
I guess so.

32:46.924 --> 32:49.405
There is no ex-boyfriend, is there, Megan?

32:49.599 --> 32:50.441
What?

32:50.491 --> 32:51.844
You have been staging these accidents

32:51.894 --> 32:53.585
to get cosmetic surgeries, haven't you?

32:53.635 --> 32:55.938
You have body dysmorphic disorder.

32:55.972 --> 32:57.139
What's that?

32:57.426 --> 32:59.408
You perceive imperfections in yourself

32:59.475 --> 33:00.875
that no one else notices.

33:00.910 --> 33:03.645
And this is a very serious
condition you have,

33:03.713 --> 33:05.880
but this is a real opportunity
for you to get help.

33:06.649 --> 33:08.217
I don't know what you mean.

33:08.284 --> 33:09.384
I think you do.

33:09.419 --> 33:11.286
I think you know exactly what we mean.

33:11.321 --> 33:13.455
I'm-I'm fine.

33:13.489 --> 33:15.724
Really, y-you don't have to worry about me.

33:15.791 --> 33:18.960
Megan, you need real help.

33:18.994 --> 33:22.964
You did help me.

33:22.998 --> 33:24.766
Thank you.

33:29.205 --> 33:32.006
- Can't you do something about this?
- No.

33:32.041 --> 33:34.875
We have to let her go.

33:36.445 --> 33:39.913
Whew! Will you look at that?

33:39.948 --> 33:42.916
These feet are actually starting
to look like feet.

33:42.951 --> 33:45.419
Let's get him up to the ICU.

33:45.454 --> 33:46.920
He's done.

33:46.955 --> 33:48.922
We are done.

33:48.957 --> 33:53.526
And then I will page Melanda,
let her know he's coming up,

33:53.561 --> 33:57.697
and then she can let the family up.

34:05.439 --> 34:07.574
Selena.

34:07.608 --> 34:11.010
She is really, really grateful
for that ride home you gave her.

34:12.545 --> 34:14.847
Alex Reid.

34:14.882 --> 34:16.949
Joel Goran.

34:19.152 --> 34:22.221
Is there something
that you'd like to tell me?

34:25.592 --> 34:27.226
Full disclosure.

34:31.099 --> 34:33.565
Yes, there was a moment, okay?

34:35.936 --> 34:38.570
She kissed me.

34:38.605 --> 34:41.407
Look, I think she misunderstood something

34:41.440 --> 34:43.708
because what started as a thank-you

34:43.777 --> 34:46.911
ended up being a kiss.

34:47.739 --> 34:50.081
And it was inappropriate, but, you know...

34:50.116 --> 34:52.551
look, I said nothing because...

34:52.619 --> 34:54.520
Well, it meant nothing.

34:56.745 --> 34:57.672
You sure about that?

34:57.722 --> 35:00.992
Yes. I'm very sure about that.

35:19.485 --> 35:22.303
Oh.

35:23.164 --> 35:24.828
Hey, my little lady.

35:25.025 --> 35:26.171
Daddy!

35:26.251 --> 35:29.878
Rachel, don't jump up on daddy.
Give him some space.

35:30.179 --> 35:31.847
Sweetie, the doctors are here.

35:32.218 --> 35:34.816
Mr. Stewart, you had a close call today.

35:34.851 --> 35:36.117
Had your work cut out for you, docs.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.104
Yeah, we're gonna be seeing
a lot of each other,

35:38.192 --> 35:42.223
Mr. Stewart, but, um, for now,
it all looks pretty positive.

35:43.659 --> 35:44.749
So...

35:45.168 --> 35:46.860
when can I race again?

36:03.745 --> 36:04.980
Do you think we fit?

36:05.057 --> 36:07.514
- Not a doubt in my mind.
- I have doubts.

36:07.583 --> 36:09.716
Alex, she kissed me.

36:09.954 --> 36:11.763
This isn't about the kiss.

36:11.875 --> 36:13.544
Y-you said that there was nothing else.

36:13.594 --> 36:14.642
And there isn't anything else.

36:14.726 --> 36:17.023
Listen, I just spent the day
saving a man's legs,

36:17.058 --> 36:19.320
so forgive me if I can't remember a kiss
from a woman

36:19.370 --> 36:20.672
- who I barely even know, right?
- Okay, fine.

36:20.724 --> 36:21.738
How... how come I don't know

36:21.810 --> 36:23.133
about the clinic and your knife fights?

36:23.273 --> 36:25.865
- There was no knife fight is why!
- Joel, am I the only one

36:25.900 --> 36:27.233
who doesn't know about all this stuff?

36:27.267 --> 36:28.468
Okay, listen to me.

36:28.502 --> 36:32.739
The clinic, yes,
it was a-an inspiring thing,

36:32.773 --> 36:34.741
- and it's...
- Yes, yeah, it was a thing.

36:34.775 --> 36:37.594
And this morning, you had a new thing.

36:37.683 --> 36:39.198
- Liberia?
- Yes.

36:39.279 --> 36:40.714
Joel, every time that you're bored,

36:40.775 --> 36:42.013
you want something new...

36:42.093 --> 36:44.016
you want something bigger, brighter, better.

36:44.050 --> 36:46.519
- That is not fair. Stop.
- It's happening again!

36:46.553 --> 36:48.602
What we have is great

36:48.775 --> 36:52.391
until it stops being great,
and then it becomes nothing.

36:52.426 --> 36:53.978
What are you talking about? You know what?
I'm not even listening.

36:54.028 --> 36:55.861
This is a product of your exhaustion.

36:55.895 --> 36:57.978
- No, it's not exhaustion!
- Yes, it almost certainly is,

36:58.054 --> 36:59.574
Alex, all right, because... you know what?

36:59.667 --> 37:01.850
We need to stop and just
consider what we're saying.

37:01.910 --> 37:04.501
No, I need to stop this because
I know how it ends. We crash!

37:04.551 --> 37:07.372
- No, we don't crash, Alex!
- You always crash!

37:07.406 --> 37:09.235
We make this work!

37:09.312 --> 37:10.904
We can't.

37:12.912 --> 37:16.448
We can't because I'm me and you're you.

37:18.784 --> 37:20.852
Don't...

37:32.931 --> 37:34.448
I saved the date.

37:34.933 --> 37:38.202
Listen, I know you probably want
an explanation as to why I...

37:38.270 --> 37:39.377
Kissed me?

37:39.461 --> 37:40.744
The kiss. We kissed.

37:40.816 --> 37:41.837
It was nothing.

37:41.890 --> 37:43.039
Oh, I'm not saying it was something,

37:43.104 --> 37:44.876
but it wasn't nothing.

37:44.943 --> 37:45.977
Why did you do it?

37:46.011 --> 37:48.479
Maybe I was bored.

37:48.529 --> 37:49.536
So I should be flattered?

37:49.617 --> 37:51.225
Oh, Dr. Lin, get over yourself.

37:51.297 --> 37:52.443
Just forget it ever happened.

37:52.493 --> 37:53.886
Is that what you're doing?

37:53.987 --> 37:56.287
You're marrying a guy you hardly know.

37:56.544 --> 37:59.338
Most of my orthodox friends
were married by 22.

37:59.388 --> 38:00.891
I'm 27.

38:00.925 --> 38:02.626
Not to mention, as an educated woman,

38:02.694 --> 38:04.394
I'm considered completely undatable.

38:04.461 --> 38:06.196
It's a miracle I found a man at all

38:06.263 --> 38:07.431
before I shrivel up and die.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.943
You don't have to get married.

38:09.003 --> 38:10.953
I want to be married.

38:11.535 --> 38:13.603
But do you love him?

38:23.247 --> 38:25.682
Hey, Charlie, I didn't expect
to see you here today.

38:25.749 --> 38:29.085
Yeah, that, uh... that was the plan.

38:29.152 --> 38:30.264
Everything okay?

38:30.340 --> 38:32.692
Yeah. No.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.981
Me neither.

38:36.117 --> 38:38.835
Well, aren't we the lord
and lady of "downer" abbey?

38:41.098 --> 38:42.765
Good night, Charlie.

38:42.833 --> 38:45.067
Yeah, good night.

38:52.709 --> 38:54.616
- It took you long enough.
- Hey, um...

38:54.680 --> 38:56.726
Let's go.

38:56.776 --> 38:58.847
How did, uh... how did the fundraiser go?

38:58.881 --> 39:01.350
Apparently, there are 17 steps
to making a crepe.

39:01.417 --> 39:02.813
Oh, really? See, I thought there were 19.

39:02.878 --> 39:04.753
I learned something new.

39:04.820 --> 39:05.792
How was your day?

39:05.889 --> 39:08.423
Oh, you know, mangled feet, bloody boobs.

39:08.491 --> 39:10.759
It's all rainbows
and respirators in the ICU.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.894
Mm, yeah, I think I'm just gonna go home

39:12.962 --> 39:15.329
and, you know, have a drink,
watch some bad TV.

39:15.397 --> 39:17.832
Okay. See you tomorrow, Dr. Miller.

39:17.867 --> 39:21.335
Or...

39:21.403 --> 39:23.304
you can come to my house tonight.

39:23.338 --> 39:24.279
It's a school night.

39:24.335 --> 39:25.665
I don't have the kids.

39:25.726 --> 39:27.053
I have homework.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.166
I can help with that.

39:28.216 --> 39:30.077
- Really? How?
- I'm a doctor.

39:30.111 --> 39:30.679
I'll bring my lab coat,

39:30.729 --> 39:32.813
and we can work on our bedside manner.

39:32.881 --> 39:34.815
Then I'll never get my paper done.

39:34.849 --> 39:37.585
Okay. Well...

39:37.619 --> 39:39.720
Offer's off the table, then.

39:39.755 --> 39:42.055
Uh, Dr. Miller?

39:42.090 --> 39:43.257
Hmm?

39:43.324 --> 39:45.893
There is one thing that's been bugging me.

39:45.927 --> 39:47.861
Maybe you could take a look at it?

39:47.896 --> 39:51.331
Uh, yeah, I should be able to fit you in.

39:51.365 --> 39:53.167
Say 20 minutes?

39:53.201 --> 39:55.535
It might need a full work-up. 10?

39:55.569 --> 39:57.805
Yeah. 10.

40:12.353 --> 40:13.613
Mm.

40:13.663 --> 40:16.175
I lost your engagement ring today.

40:16.523 --> 40:20.026
I tried it on, and it flew off my finger.

40:21.610 --> 40:23.863
Didn't I give that back to Charlie?

40:24.935 --> 40:27.112
No, but

40:27.162 --> 40:30.703
I wish I'd thought
of that line 12 hours ago.

40:32.739 --> 40:36.308
This is the part where
you get really, really mad.

40:36.343 --> 40:39.478
Nah. Not really. I mean, maybe.

40:39.512 --> 40:43.114
I'm just too tired to care.

40:43.182 --> 40:44.650
You okay?

40:44.684 --> 40:47.319
You want to talk?

40:47.354 --> 40:48.854
Yeah.

40:48.921 --> 40:51.622
I'm sorry about the ring.

40:51.657 --> 40:55.593
It's okay.

40:58.664 --> 41:01.967
Monogamy literally rejects me.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.135
What?

41:04.170 --> 41:07.104
Never mind.

41:17.349 --> 41:19.650
- Oh, don't tell me she's back.
- No.

41:19.718 --> 41:22.853
I just brought you a nice,
hot cup of coffee.

41:22.921 --> 41:24.293
Thank you.

41:24.374 --> 41:26.041
No, no, she's not gonna be back.

41:26.091 --> 41:27.144
I think she's gonna move on to...

41:27.212 --> 41:29.037
Yeah, someone who's not on to her.

41:29.114 --> 41:30.770
- Exactly.
- Great.

41:32.620 --> 41:33.749
You didn't do anything wrong.

41:33.826 --> 41:35.924
- Why do I feel so horrible?
- I don't know.

41:36.037 --> 41:37.006
I treat 'em and street 'em.

41:37.143 --> 41:39.072
I make mistakes every day, several mistakes.

41:40.009 --> 41:42.180
You just said I didn't do anything wrong.

41:42.245 --> 41:45.067
See? I just made another mistake.

41:46.486 --> 41:48.147
Sometimes we miss things.

41:48.379 --> 41:49.007
Yeah, but, you know,

41:49.071 --> 41:51.451
a lot of my patients are return clients.

41:51.548 --> 41:53.136
So, the question is, am I seeing

41:53.196 --> 41:55.894
what's really there
or just what I want to see?

41:57.064 --> 41:58.560
You're a good doctor.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.723
I get that a lot.

42:00.757 --> 42:02.191
Good night, Dana.

42:02.259 --> 42:03.692
Thanks, Zach.

42:15.572 --> 42:17.205
You're right, and...
