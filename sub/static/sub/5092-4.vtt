WEBVTT

00:04.105 --> 00:06.474
BOY 1:
I got ya. I got one more
for you-- two more for you.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.475
BOY 2:
Oh, wow, okay.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.742
GIRL:
Wow.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.244
Where do you find a dog
with no legs?

00:10.278 --> 00:11.412
I don't know, man.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.414
Exactly where
you left him. Right?

00:13.447 --> 00:16.484
Yeah, right.
That's pretty funny.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.119
Hey, Erin.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.454
That better not be
a new case for me.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.690
Worse. A 440 appeal
based on DNA.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.724
(sighs)

00:23.757 --> 00:26.394
Convict named Miles Thomas
convinced some team

00:26.427 --> 00:28.829
of do-gooder lawyers that
he was unjustly convicted.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.264
Aren't they all?
Exactly.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.765
Rosselini wants you
to take care of it.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.201
I'm starting the Reyes trial.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.502
I'm in the middle
of motion practice.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.603
Why me?

00:35.636 --> 00:37.605
He told me
you'd ask that.
And?

00:37.638 --> 00:40.441
He said that once you read
the file, you'd know.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.443
(sighs)

00:46.614 --> 00:48.449
(elevator bell dings)

00:48.482 --> 00:50.784
The mayor wants to speak
to you about security

00:50.818 --> 00:52.586
for the president's
visit next week.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.323
We also got a request from
the French mission to the U.N.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.325
They want to award you
the Legion of Honor medal.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.592
For what?

00:58.626 --> 01:01.829
Apparently, you gave them some
advice about Paris subway crime.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.497
It would be an insult
to decline.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.199
I'll decline anyway.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.235
Compstats for
this month.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.503
Robbery down seven
percent, murder down 12.

01:09.537 --> 01:12.340
Now, that's something
to celebrate.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.445
(knocking)

01:17.478 --> 01:18.479
Hey, bean pole.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.148
My court appearance
got canceled.

01:20.181 --> 01:23.717
Any interest in greasy burgers
and vanilla shakes?

01:23.751 --> 01:26.454
Oh, I'd love to, but I need
to take a rain check.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.421
I'm swamped.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.523
At least you're putting away
more bad guys.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.225
Uh, not exactly.

01:31.259 --> 01:35.763
I got this appeal from a convict
named Miles Thomas.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.532
He's been in prison
for 18 years for rape.

01:38.566 --> 01:41.402
Yeah, and I'm sure Miles Thomas
says he didn't do it.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.437
He does swear
that he's innocent.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.306
Says the victim made a mistake.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.474
Cue the bleeding heart.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.542
Wants a DNA test.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.479
The sample was too small
to be tested back then.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.414
Or you could just ask
the arresting officer,

01:53.447 --> 01:55.549
and I'm sure the arresting
officer will tell you

01:55.583 --> 01:57.418
that Miles Thomas
is full of crap.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.553
Yeah, well, that won't be hard.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.655
The arresting officer:
Frank Reagan.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.394
Yes!

02:06.427 --> 02:07.695
Oh, hey, you all know why

02:07.728 --> 02:09.797
Cinderella was thrown off
the team?

02:10.731 --> 02:11.632
Why?

02:13.367 --> 02:14.835
'Cause she ran away
from the ball.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.238
(all laughing)

02:17.271 --> 02:19.807
You're so not funny.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.475
(gunshot)

02:22.276 --> 02:24.312
(gunshot)

02:26.847 --> 02:28.316
(gunshot)

03:15.529 --> 03:20.368
MAN:
Darren Gorski and Alex Kasper,
both 17-- dead at the scene.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.304
EMS transported the other vic,
Christina Ruiz,

03:23.337 --> 03:25.439
also 17.
What's her condition?

03:25.473 --> 03:26.307
Circling the drain.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.009
All right, did
anybody see anything?

03:29.042 --> 03:31.445
Not that an initial
canvass has turned up.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.314
Great. You know what,
let's re-canvass, okay?

03:33.347 --> 03:35.349
And expand the perimeter, and
let's get somebody down here

03:35.383 --> 03:37.418
to take down the plates on all
these vehicles, all right?

03:37.451 --> 03:38.419
All right.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.354
Danny, I got
Darren Gorski's aunt,

03:40.388 --> 03:41.555
Mrs. Holmes.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.357
My sister can't talk right now.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.458
This is unbelievable.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.594
Her only child.
We're really sorry.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.929
Why don't we go over
here and talk, all right?

03:48.962 --> 03:50.564
What happens now?

03:50.598 --> 03:52.466
He's still lying there.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.667
When the investigators
are done,

03:53.701 --> 03:54.968
he'll be moved to
the medical examiners.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.737
Now, do you have any
idea what the kids

03:56.770 --> 03:58.372
were doing here
in the park?

03:58.406 --> 03:59.373
Playing basketball.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.207
They like to play.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.276
What about the girl?
Did you know her?

04:02.310 --> 04:04.912
She was Darren's girlfriend.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.348
The three of them are
friends since pre-K.

04:07.381 --> 04:10.050
Do you know if any of them had
a problem with anyone or...?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.785
These were good kids--

04:11.819 --> 04:13.721
all three of them.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.988
How good?

04:15.022 --> 04:17.391
My nephew just got
a scholarship to Fordham.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.327
He wanted to be an architect.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.030
We never really know
what our kids are up to.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.933
Darren was never in trouble.
Never.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.501
None of them were.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.969
I'm just trying to figure out
what happened, okay?

04:29.002 --> 04:30.538
They were playing basketball.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.273
Let me take her.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.312
For what it's worth,

04:38.346 --> 04:40.348
a few of the locals
said nobody saw anything,

04:40.381 --> 04:42.683
as people stay away
from this end of the park.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.318
It's a drug hot spot.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.853
Of course. All right, thanks.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.869
The mayor wants to know why

05:01.902 --> 05:04.538
you turned down the honorary
from the French Embassy.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.574
I got two dead kids in
a playground shooting,

05:06.607 --> 05:08.342
and the mayor wants
to know that.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.411
Danny caught the case.
You want to give him a call?

05:12.079 --> 05:14.348
I didn't think so.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.049
I'll tell the mayor you had
a scheduling conflict.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.718
Scheduling conflict?

05:17.751 --> 05:20.454
Take a little more pride
in our lame excuses, will ya?

05:21.655 --> 05:24.458
Bad time to stop by?

05:24.492 --> 05:27.428
Never a bad time
to see my daughter.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.996
Hey, Garrett.
Should I stay?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.398
Yes, please.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.533
It's about
an old case of yours.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.602
Miles Thomas.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.438
He was picked up in
the neighborhood after a rape.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.006
He had priors
for burglary.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.874
The victim positively
I.D.'d him in a lineup...

05:40.908 --> 05:43.110
Elizabeth Fox-- sexual assault,

05:43.143 --> 05:45.413
two broken ribs
and a crushed cheekbone.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.581
Good memory.
Hard to forget.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.149
What about Miles Thomas?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.585
His lawyers have petitioned
to reopen the case.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.021
They want to get a DNA test
that they couldn't do back then.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.656
If this Thomas isn't a match,

05:55.689 --> 05:57.558
does it land back
in Frank's lap?

05:57.591 --> 05:59.126
He was the arresting officer.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.829
Garrett, I don't think we need
to be putting out fires

06:01.862 --> 06:03.731
that haven't started.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.566
Thanks for the
heads up, Counselor.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.634
How about dinner?

06:12.473 --> 06:14.608
Hey, hey, unless someone invites
you in, you're not coming in.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.610
Who's going to invite
me in, the thief?

06:16.644 --> 06:18.479
I want my laptop back.
Son of a bitch.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.514
I will burn this place down.
Dial it down.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.615
You called the cops?

06:21.649 --> 06:23.617
Yeah, I called the cops.

06:23.651 --> 06:24.317
What's going on here?

06:24.351 --> 06:25.919
Crazy here won't take a hike.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.656
There's a thief in there.
He stole my laptop!

06:29.623 --> 06:30.958
Okay, okay, well,
how do you know?

06:30.991 --> 06:33.026
There, right there.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.528
My laptop sends
out a signal.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.897
See? The signal
goes to my map app.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.500
See? Right there. The green dot
is on this building.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.901
Let me see that.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.171
This really works?
Of course it works.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.874
We just have to go in there,
see who's got a new laptop...

06:46.907 --> 06:48.075
No, not we.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.210
Unless this computer here is
attached to a suicide bomber,

06:50.243 --> 06:52.613
we take the complaint, and then
you go on your merry way.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.548
It's a crime right here.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.650
No, not right here.
Are you blind?

06:56.684 --> 06:59.019
The green dot is accurate
to within about 200 feet.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.888
Your laptop could be
in this building

07:00.921 --> 07:02.523
or over there
or over there.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.791
200 feet? You sure?

07:03.824 --> 07:06.126
Come on, I'll take
your complaint.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.597
All right, buddy.
It's your problem now.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.598
Yeah.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.966
Yeah, all
right, thanks.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.604
Well, we won't be speaking to
Christina Ruiz any time soon.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.639
They just put her in
a medically-induced coma.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.741
Oh, well, I ran her
and her friends before.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.843
Seems like she's the only
one with a record.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.111
Six months ago
for possession.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.579
Possession?

07:25.613 --> 07:27.214
Well, see, maybe they're
not angels after all.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.849
Whoa, whoa, it was
only a few joints.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.083
Could be just
recreational.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.086
Maybe so. Let's see
who their playmates are.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.824
All right, drug arrests
in the park.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.526
Let's see.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.562
Drug dealer with the most priors
is Xavier Sardina.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.096
Nice name.
Let's go pay him a visit.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.131
Okay.

07:49.737 --> 07:50.971
Mr. Sardina.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.172
Who is it?

07:52.205 --> 07:53.674
Package for you.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.513
Police.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.681
We need to ask you
a few questions.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.884
Hey!

08:05.719 --> 08:06.820
Hold it!

08:06.854 --> 08:07.855
Hey!

08:10.123 --> 08:11.825
Come here.
Come here.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.293
All we wanted to do

08:13.326 --> 08:15.596
was ask you
a few questions, moron.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.664
Okay, okay!

08:16.697 --> 08:18.732
"Okay" nothing.
It's too late.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.267
No, really, what
do you want to know?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.069
Oh, come on,
down at that station.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.037
And after that,
we're going to charge you

08:24.071 --> 08:27.074
with possession
with intent to sell.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.746
And approximate value
of the item?

08:32.780 --> 08:34.047
Priceless.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.586
I used remote access to put
a message on the screen.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.953
You can do that, huh?

08:39.987 --> 08:40.954
Yeah.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.189
I said, "Hey, scum sucker,

08:42.222 --> 08:44.157
I'm going to track you down
and kill you."

08:44.191 --> 08:45.593
You're talking to
two police officers

08:45.626 --> 08:46.894
about threatening
to kill someone?

08:46.927 --> 08:48.596
It's rhetoric.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.765
Rhetoric-- I'm not familiar
with the vernacular.

08:51.799 --> 08:52.700
Send another message.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.702
Tell him you really need
the computer back.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.670
You're willing to pay $500 cash,
no questions asked.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.739
I'm not paying him
for my own computer.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.274
If he agrees to meet you,
we'll be there, we'll bust him.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.676
I like the way this man thinks.

09:02.710 --> 09:03.911
Call the precinct tomorrow.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.215
You couldn't just fill out
the 61 and be done with him?

09:08.248 --> 09:09.783
Get this guy.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.019
Come on, Sarge,
it'll be fun.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.053
Yeah.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.790
Hey, Gramps.

09:16.824 --> 09:17.891
Erin.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.760
Sweetie.
Hi.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.061
That smells good.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.763
I'm working on
my specialty.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.364
He says everything's
his specialty.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.667
It's your mom's favorite.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.235
Shepherd's pie.

09:28.268 --> 09:33.707
To be honest, I never get
the ingredients exactly right.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.742
There's something missing.

09:34.775 --> 09:35.943
Yeah, her.

09:43.183 --> 09:46.954
So, Mom, Melissa and her sister
invited me into the city

09:46.987 --> 09:49.723
to go to dinner at this cool
new restaurant Monday night.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.725
Yeah, Monday night
is a school night.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.761
But we have off Tuesday
for a professional day.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.663
So can I go?

09:55.696 --> 09:58.866
And what time do you expect
to be coming back home?

09:58.899 --> 09:59.900
Like, 11:00.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.935
10:00, latest.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.838
Please, Mom.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.808
Yeah, I don't know if I want you
riding the subway that late.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.009
Why not?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.945
I bet Grandpa let you ride the
subway when you were my age.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.984
I can neither confirm nor deny
that allegation.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.285
See?

10:18.318 --> 10:19.720
See?

10:19.753 --> 10:22.055
Hell, I was on a destroyer
in the Pacific

10:22.089 --> 10:23.857
when I wasn't much older
than you.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.826
Thanks, Gramps.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.328
So I can go?

10:30.163 --> 10:31.832
Okay.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.834
But...

10:33.867 --> 10:35.335
I got to text Melissa.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.007
She had a very convincing
closing argument.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.109
Yeah, it must run in the family.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.681
Dad...

10:47.715 --> 10:49.717
the DNA test came back.

10:49.750 --> 10:50.951
And?

10:50.984 --> 10:54.722
It does not match Miles Thomas.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.356
He didn't do it.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.785
I heard about those kids
who got shot, man.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.119
Wish I'd have been there.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.254
Why?

11:27.287 --> 11:30.090
I been taking capoeira.
It's, like, Brazilian karate.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.025
I would have stepped in
with, like, a chop.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.827
Okay, back it up, Batman.

11:33.861 --> 11:34.895
You saying you weren't there?

11:34.928 --> 11:37.865
I was at home.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.467
With my mom watching Judge Judy.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.271
Do you know these kids?

11:44.304 --> 11:46.306
Yeah.
Are they customers?

11:46.339 --> 11:49.743
No. They don't smoke, they don't
party, they don't even drink.

11:49.777 --> 11:52.312
H-Hold on. Are you sure?

11:52.345 --> 11:55.348
We know this girl took
a marijuana collar.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.050
JACKIE:
Christina Ruiz?

11:57.084 --> 11:58.185
Yeah, but that was bogus.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.487
What, you think we haven't heard
that ten million times?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.089
The weed wasn't even hers.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.924
Her boyfriend shoved it
in her backpack

12:03.957 --> 12:05.258
when he saw the cops coming!

12:05.292 --> 12:07.027
Her boyfriend,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.162
this guy,
Darren Gorski?

12:09.196 --> 12:12.399
Yeah. I've heard
he's a gangbanger.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.973
We got a hit on the DNA
from the rape.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.208
Matches this guy,

12:21.241 --> 12:22.910
Justin Armel.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.411
He's got convictions
for assault

12:24.444 --> 12:27.314
and criminal possession
of a controlled substance.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.249
He spent five years
in Greenhaven.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.351
Released 2004.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.121
Miles Thomas.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.557
They could be brothers.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.026
Yep.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.194
That's why your victim got
the I.D. wrong.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.195
(sighs)

12:42.229 --> 12:43.330
Dad...

12:43.363 --> 12:45.398
no one can
blame you.
(intercom beeps)

12:45.432 --> 12:46.399
Baker.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.568
Where is Justin Armel?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.037
On the street.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.338
But we can't charge him

12:51.371 --> 12:52.172
with a 18-year-old rape
because...

12:52.205 --> 12:54.074
Because it was
a five-year statute

12:54.107 --> 12:55.042
of limitations back then,

12:55.075 --> 12:57.244
but if he raped once
and got away with it,

12:57.277 --> 12:58.578
he probably raped again.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.047
Okay, but there are

13:00.080 --> 13:01.882
no open cases pointing to him.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.817
Maybe it wasn't reported.

13:03.851 --> 13:07.287
You said you wanted to get out
from behind a desk, Detective.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.222
I want you to put
a magnifying glass

13:09.256 --> 13:11.324
on this man's life--

13:11.358 --> 13:14.361
jobs, places of residence,
any woman who quit or moved

13:14.394 --> 13:16.363
to get away
from him.
Tall order.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.131
I want him.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.077
Thanks for meeting me
here, Elizabeth.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.212
The idea of the Commissioner
coming to your office...

13:32.245 --> 13:33.881
Forgive me, Commissioner,
I really...

13:33.914 --> 13:34.915
Frank, please.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.383
Frank.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.886
It's not your fault.

13:38.919 --> 13:42.355
But I can't say that seeing you
again brings back fond memories.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.391
I wouldn't think so.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.526
So...

13:46.559 --> 13:49.429
Miles Thomas getting
an early release?

13:51.198 --> 13:54.134
I mean, why else would you have
asked to meet me?

13:56.336 --> 13:59.272
(sighs)

13:59.306 --> 14:01.408
It looks that way, yes.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.247
Hmm. For what, good behavior?

14:07.280 --> 14:09.416
(groans)

14:09.449 --> 14:11.084
Elizabeth, there's been
a terrible mistake.

14:11.118 --> 14:15.055
They did an updated
DNA test on the rape kit,

14:15.088 --> 14:17.457
and it wasn't a match
for Miles Thomas.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.326
What are you saying?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.661
It was a match for another man.

14:21.694 --> 14:25.432
In appearance,
they could be brothers.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.268
I got the wrong man?

14:28.301 --> 14:30.003
No.
Are you sure?

14:30.037 --> 14:32.906
We got the wrong man.

14:35.475 --> 14:39.412
And... yes,
the evidence is solid.

14:41.448 --> 14:44.151
18 years it took
to get it right?

14:46.319 --> 14:48.488
What about the other man,
the one it does match?

14:48.521 --> 14:50.924
Doing everything we can
to investigate...

14:50.958 --> 14:52.892
Yeah, it's gonna take another
18 years, Frank?

14:55.528 --> 14:57.497
(sighs)

14:57.530 --> 14:59.566
I wish I had an easy answer.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.237
(voice breaking):
Oh, my God, Frank.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.373
(sobbing)

15:19.186 --> 15:23.023
Copy that. Made my day.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.457
Your friend with
the stolen computer--

15:24.491 --> 15:26.559
he just got a text back
from the perp.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.428
He's gonna sell it
back to him tomorrow

15:28.461 --> 15:30.530
in Washington Square Park
at 2:00 p.m.

15:30.563 --> 15:31.564
We gonna be there?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.466
In plain clothes.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.401
Great.

15:35.635 --> 15:36.469
Not great?

15:36.503 --> 15:38.205
Well, at least we get

15:38.238 --> 15:39.506
some fresh air, you know?

15:41.508 --> 15:43.643
All right, well,
I've been to the Gang Squad.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.478
Seems they never heard
of Darren Gorski.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.680
And I've been through every

15:47.714 --> 15:50.483
gang roster and surveillance
photo in the neighborhood.

15:50.517 --> 15:51.718
Nothing.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.520
Look at these guys.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.255
So busy being stupid
it's a wonder

15:55.288 --> 15:56.990
they could find time
to get arrested.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.629
I don't know. Running out
of motive here, Danny.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.464
Yeah, yeah, here we go,
here we go.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.632
They're all perfect
little angels, right?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.134
I mean, come on, Jack.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.568
How do we investigate
the case then?

16:08.601 --> 16:10.703
What are we gonna do,
we gonna canvass heaven?

16:10.737 --> 16:12.639
Why does it seem like
it bothers you so much

16:12.672 --> 16:14.407
that these kids
may actually be good kids?

16:14.441 --> 16:15.408
It's not that, Jack.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.544
It's just years of experience
speaking to me.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.546
Well, my years of experience say

16:19.579 --> 16:21.481
that sometimes bad things happen
to good people.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.416
Fair enough.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.218
Okay, let's get back to Gorski.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.387
If Gorski's in a gang,
then they're probably gonna have

16:27.420 --> 16:28.455
a presence at the funeral,
right?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.756
Because the gangs
always show up.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.758
Yes, there is a candlelight
vigil held for him

16:31.791 --> 16:32.792
in the park tonight.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.395
Great. TARU will be there
with their cameras,

16:35.428 --> 16:38.365
and we'll pick up some candles
on the way.

16:45.638 --> 16:49.142
Mr. Thomas, I'm Erin Reagan.

16:49.176 --> 16:52.112
You can call me Miles.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.547
I'm the ADA handling
your case.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.183
When do I get out?

16:56.216 --> 16:58.118
As soon as the judge
is convinced

16:58.151 --> 16:59.652
that you were wrongly convicted.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.422
What? You saw the DNA test.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.823
There was other evidence.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.458
We need to explain

17:05.492 --> 17:09.229
why we made a mistake,
why the jury made a mistake.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.598
You were picked up near
the scene of the rape.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.100
You had a very confusing story

17:13.133 --> 17:14.601
as to where you had been
that night.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.203
I was 20!

17:16.236 --> 17:18.705
I was drunk.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.208
I didn't remember
where I'd been.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.711
But I remembered
that I didn't rape anyone.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.518
Do you know this man?

17:37.157 --> 17:39.359
This is what happened?

17:41.428 --> 17:44.431
I'm doing this guy's time
in here?

17:46.499 --> 17:49.836
So... what's he been doing
out there?

17:49.869 --> 17:51.238
We're looking into that.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.739
You're looking into that.

17:52.772 --> 17:56.143
I should track him down,
get him to tell me.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.312
This guy has my life!

18:04.751 --> 18:07.487
There are programs to help you
when you get out.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.757
Do you have a time machine,
Ms. Reagan?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.628
(soft music playing)

18:21.468 --> 18:23.736
JACKIE:
Not exactly a hotbed
of gang activity.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.739
No. I don't know, Jack.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.641
What don't you know?

18:28.675 --> 18:31.244
I don't know how three kids
get shot for no reason.

18:31.278 --> 18:34.147
Danny, sometimes, you know,
there is no reason.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.916
I know. Maybe I'm just hoping
there is a reason this time.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.319
I got no motive,
no suspects.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.588
We may as well open a phone book
and pick a name.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.158
Let's go pay our respects.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.626
Excuse me.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.562
Excuse us, please.
Excuse us.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.942
I don't see anything here

19:02.975 --> 19:05.812
to indicate Gorski
was in a gang, Jack.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.886
Hold on. Who's this?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.825
"I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me"?

19:20.427 --> 19:24.531
Phone book might have
just gotten a little smaller.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.341
You saw the
rape victim?

19:34.374 --> 19:36.243
I felt she deserved
to learn the news

19:36.276 --> 19:37.610
from a person,
not a paper.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.446
And that person had to be you?

19:39.479 --> 19:43.916
I try to save my DCPI
for the tough assignments.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.758
He was 20 years old.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.326
Do you remember being 20,
Garrett?

19:53.360 --> 19:56.263
Supposedly, your whole life
is in front of you.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.365
All I could see was fog.

19:58.398 --> 20:01.468
20, I was walking a beat
in Bed-Stuy,

20:01.501 --> 20:03.403
the Watergate hearings
were on every TV

20:03.436 --> 20:05.638
and Joe was still in diapers.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.575
If I'm Miles Thomas,

20:08.608 --> 20:11.644
Joe was a rookie cop
by the time I got out.

20:11.678 --> 20:14.747
But you're not Miles Thomas,
and this isn't your fault.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.650
If you're gonna go there,
I'm not your guy.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.687
You should walk in
the other man's shoes sometime.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.822
Keeps you humble.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.325
I get all the humility
I need, Frank.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.726
I work for you.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.569
This is nice
to be treated.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.371
Can I get some whip cream,
please?

20:38.405 --> 20:39.372
Sure, sweetie.
(ringtone playing)

20:39.406 --> 20:40.573
Honey, your
phone's ringing.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.409
Can you get it?
It's probably just Melissa.

20:42.442 --> 20:46.279
Just tell her
I'll meet her out front.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.481
Who are Peter and Liam?

20:48.515 --> 20:50.383
Why are you reading my texts?

20:50.417 --> 20:52.452
Well, it's hard to miss
when the phone's in my hand.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.721
You told me you were meeting
Melissa and her sister.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.556
Is her sister's name
Peter or Liam?

20:56.589 --> 20:58.625
Her sister is gonna be there.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.427
It's a group.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.296
A group with boys.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.964
They do exist.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.666
Boys I don't know.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.335
Mom, you're
overreacting.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.902
I don't think so.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.304
This is about
those kids

21:11.338 --> 21:13.306
that were shot in
the park, isn't it?

21:13.340 --> 21:15.041
Every time something
like that happens,

21:15.074 --> 21:16.576
you get more
strict with me.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.844
Hey, I get more strict

21:17.877 --> 21:20.046
when you don't tell me
the truth.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.682
Mom, I'm 15.
Why can't you just trust me?

21:22.715 --> 21:25.452
I want you to be honest with me.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.886
Is this some kind
of double date?

21:26.919 --> 21:28.321
It's not a date.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.022
And you do know Peter and Liam.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.891
You met them at my recital.

21:31.924 --> 21:34.594
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.630
Forget it. I won't go.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.702
(sighs)

21:42.735 --> 21:45.705
Hey, what's going on, sis?

21:45.738 --> 21:47.907
Take you up on
those greasy burgers

21:47.940 --> 21:48.741
and vanilla shakes?

21:48.775 --> 21:51.010
Something must be
really bothering you

21:51.043 --> 21:53.480
if you're in the mood
for grease and fat.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.681
The teenage years.

21:54.714 --> 21:55.982
Nicky?

21:56.015 --> 21:59.452
Ah, you know, they can't all
be perfect like we were.

22:02.389 --> 22:04.691
You sure that's all
that's bothering you?

22:04.724 --> 22:06.593
(sighs)

22:06.626 --> 22:09.829
I'm not getting any hits on
this rapist, Justin Armel.

22:09.862 --> 22:10.997
Okay, well, you know,

22:11.030 --> 22:12.632
guys like that
eventually slip up.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.067
Well, I don't think
I have "eventually."

22:15.101 --> 22:16.469
I know Dad doesn't.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.770
He keeps telling
everybody he's fine,

22:17.804 --> 22:19.672
but he is taking this hard.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.808
We've seen Dad get
through a lot worse than this.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.643
I know.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.512
Just wish I wasn't the one

22:25.545 --> 22:28.147
who has to keep giving
him all the bad news.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.483
I don't even know what
to say to him anymore.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.519
I hear you.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.555
(cell phone chiming)

22:38.425 --> 22:41.561
Guess who is on his way over
to my office with his lawyer.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.396
Who?
Justin Armel.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.932
Good. Well, maybe you can
get him to confess.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.535
Hey, you got me to confess
to things as kids

22:48.568 --> 22:49.636
that I didn't even do.

22:49.669 --> 22:50.870
Oh, you didn't do?

22:50.903 --> 22:52.038
Hey... come on.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.806
I was the good son.
Remember?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.775
Oh, right.
(laughs)

23:00.012 --> 23:01.414
(sighs)

23:01.448 --> 23:03.483
Can you fast-forward?
Yes.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.455
Right there.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.457
Right there.
All right, zoom in on that.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.464
It's a girl.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.198
Th-That's the girl from the...

23:19.231 --> 23:20.833
the Gang Squad
surveillance photos.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.035
Stacy. Stacy Vaughn.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.472
Well, happy news.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.706
(cell phone vibrating)

23:26.739 --> 23:28.007
Imagine that.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.609
Ooh, we got more good news.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.978
What is it?
Christina Ruiz just woke up.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.514
It's harassment,
plain and simple.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.683
There's been cops knocking
on my neighbors' doors,

23:36.716 --> 23:37.984
on my bosses'
doors.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.586
You know, people
are going to start

23:39.619 --> 23:41.053
to get a bad idea on me.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.254
Like what,
Mr. Armel?

23:42.288 --> 23:45.224
That you're a vicious rapist
who ought to be behind bars?

23:45.257 --> 23:46.893
You see?

23:46.926 --> 23:49.662
You are admitting
a vendetta here, Ms. Reagan.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.498
You're practically begging
for a lawsuit.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.600
Ugh.
The law is very clear on this.

23:53.633 --> 23:56.736
Okay? He can't be charged
with the rape of Elizabeth Fox.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.038
Can't be charged,
not didn't do it.

23:59.071 --> 24:01.808
How does it feel
to be defending a rapist?

24:01.841 --> 24:03.776
She lies.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.478
They all lie.

24:05.512 --> 24:06.513
Quiet.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.880
I'm putting
you on notice.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.882
One more phone call,
one more detective

24:09.916 --> 24:11.518
questioning his friends,
going to his job,

24:11.551 --> 24:14.487
sitting outside his apartment,
I'm filing papers.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.155
(laughs)
Okay, good luck with that.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.797
Baker, have you found
anyone yet?

24:28.701 --> 24:30.503
I'm sorry.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.872
I really didn't
see anything.

24:32.905 --> 24:35.074
It all happened so fast.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.043
It's okay.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.578
We know it's going
to take some time

24:38.611 --> 24:39.979
for it to all come
back, Christina.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.814
I mean, you don't remember
seeing the shooter at all?

24:41.848 --> 24:43.282
No.

24:43.315 --> 24:47.620
I... I fell down, and...
and I...

24:47.654 --> 24:51.724
I might have seen his shoes.

24:51.758 --> 24:54.694
Uh, I-I don't remember.

24:54.727 --> 24:55.628
Okay, well, do you remember

24:55.662 --> 24:57.564
what you were doing
before it happened?

24:57.597 --> 25:01.233
Uh, we were hanging out.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.235
Shooting baskets.

25:04.637 --> 25:05.905
Alex was doing

25:05.938 --> 25:08.841
a fake victory dance,
running around the court.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.943
Then he told a joke.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.612
What kind of joke?

25:12.645 --> 25:14.614
A... a dumb one.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.983
Uh, his-his family
is from Croatia,

25:17.016 --> 25:19.586
and when they came here,
he learned how to speak English

25:19.619 --> 25:21.220
by memorizing jokes.

25:21.253 --> 25:26.993
He said, "Why was Cinderella
thrown off the team?

25:28.995 --> 25:32.832
Because she ran away
from the ball."

25:32.865 --> 25:37.136
Uh, Darren and I
started laughing.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.575
Uh, and-and then...
and then it happened.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.149
When can I see Alex and Darren?

25:50.182 --> 25:51.718
How are they?

25:55.154 --> 25:56.823
You know what, uh,
for right now,

25:56.856 --> 25:59.692
I think it's best
you just get some rest, okay?

26:07.667 --> 26:09.368
Whose idea was
the orange hat?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.170
Makes him easier to find.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.674
Why not just paint
a green dot on him?

26:23.115 --> 26:25.084
Guess that's a go.
Hey. Hey.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.753
Hey! Police!

26:31.724 --> 26:33.359
Whoa! Hey!

26:33.392 --> 26:34.627
Watch it!

26:47.373 --> 26:49.008
Hands behind your back.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.843
You got him. You got him.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.147
We have to establish
ownership.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.149
Hey, we have
to establish ownership.
I got it. I got it.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.418
Hey, uh, what do we
got here, huh?

26:59.451 --> 27:00.753
I just found that.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.189
Nice. Yeah.

27:03.222 --> 27:04.724
Ah, look at this, kid.

27:04.757 --> 27:06.125
What are those?

27:06.158 --> 27:08.327
Point spreads, over-and-unders.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.395
Are you a bookie, Mr. Dexter?

27:09.428 --> 27:12.031
Is that why you
needed this back?
It's not mine.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.400
It matches the serial numbers
that you gave us.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.068
No, I told you,
I just found that.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.104
I'm returning it
for the reward.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.272
My computer's navy blue;
that one's royal blue.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.441
Yeah? You--

27:22.474 --> 27:24.711
possession of stolen property,
and you--

27:24.744 --> 27:26.112
promoting gambling.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.180
Turn around. Two felonies.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.449
Marone. Our boss is
going to love this, kid.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.118
Let's go.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.388
ERIN:
This looks great, Grandpa.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.725
Yeah, I tried a new baste.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.126
A secret ingredient.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.828
Why does that
make me worried?

27:41.861 --> 27:43.730
There was no one around
to stop me.

27:43.763 --> 27:44.797
Been a busy week.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.766
Yeah, that's
what I heard.

27:46.799 --> 27:47.967
Holding up okay, Dad?

27:48.000 --> 27:51.938
Oh, I try to think of what
I could have done differently,

27:51.971 --> 27:53.172
but that's a dead end.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.741
I can't undo what's done.

27:54.774 --> 27:57.443
I can't get Mr. Thomas
those 18 years back.

27:57.476 --> 28:00.346
All I can do is accept
what comes to me,

28:00.379 --> 28:03.750
and for me, or any of us
who do what we do,

28:03.783 --> 28:05.752
that's a tall order.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.119
Glad you asked.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.823
Eyewitness testimony
has put a lot of people away,

28:10.857 --> 28:13.325
but it's notoriously
unreliable.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.827
Small comfort.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.763
Do you think there are a lot

28:16.796 --> 28:17.997
of innocent people
in prison?

28:18.030 --> 28:19.766
I know one guilty person
who's not in prison--

28:19.799 --> 28:21.100
the actual rapist.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.402
Yeah, well, at least you
know who the bad guy is.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.104
I'm deep into this
park shooting,

28:25.137 --> 28:26.839
and I keep running
into dead ends.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.775
And then, on top of that,
everybody tells me

28:28.808 --> 28:30.409
the victims were just
innocent little kids.

28:30.442 --> 28:31.477
Maybe they were.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.812
Well, if they were,

28:32.845 --> 28:33.813
that's the scary
part, Nicky.

28:33.846 --> 28:36.015
Why?

28:36.048 --> 28:37.817
Because, then it's just
a senseless shooting.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.786
But you still will catch
all the bad guys, right?

28:39.819 --> 28:41.120
I hope so.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.055
Boys, what do you
call it when you get

28:43.089 --> 28:45.191
your rods and bait and
go down to the pier?

28:45.224 --> 28:47.827
That's not
a very tough question.

28:47.860 --> 28:48.795
Fishing.

28:48.828 --> 28:51.363
That's right, Sean--
fishing, not catching.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.832
Fishing.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.501
On good days, we catch some,
but not every day.

28:55.534 --> 28:58.004
But every day,
we keep going back.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.872
Okay, could we please just
talk about something else?

28:59.906 --> 29:01.107
I'm trying to get my mom

29:01.140 --> 29:03.175
to let me go into
the city on my own.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.411
On the subway?
At night.

29:05.444 --> 29:06.779
Thank God I have a couple years

29:06.813 --> 29:07.947
before I have
to worry about that.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.382
Please. You guys are
just way overprotective.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.517
Hey, after this week,

29:11.550 --> 29:12.985
there's not a person
at this table

29:13.019 --> 29:14.887
who thinks they could ever
be too overprotective.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.200
"I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me"?

29:28.234 --> 29:29.435
I didn't shoot them.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.171
What are you
sorry about, Stacy?

29:32.204 --> 29:34.306
Nothing. I was just
sorry they got shot.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.976
Really? "Forgive me"?
Forgive you for what?

29:37.009 --> 29:37.977
Nothing.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.545
Nothing. Okay.

29:39.578 --> 29:42.849
You know what? Um...
Gang Squad tells us

29:42.882 --> 29:44.917
that you have a boyfriend
named John-John.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.920
Hmm?

29:49.021 --> 29:52.124
Stacy, did he have
something to do with this?

29:59.631 --> 30:02.268
Think you feel pretty bad
about what happened, Stacy.

30:05.604 --> 30:08.007
Is that because
you bumped into his mom

30:08.040 --> 30:10.142
on your way to
the memorial?

30:10.176 --> 30:11.377
Hmm?

30:11.410 --> 30:13.145
Come on, take it.

30:13.179 --> 30:16.448
I said take
the picture.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.585
Do you know that he was
his mother's only child?

30:19.618 --> 30:22.254
Is that why you
feel so bad?

30:27.159 --> 30:29.862
Somebody with a conscience
wrote that note, Stacy.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.365
You have a
conscience.

30:33.399 --> 30:37.870
Somebody with no
conscience did this.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.173
John-John?

30:43.675 --> 30:46.412
(sighs)

30:46.445 --> 30:50.382
I didn't know
he was going to do it.

30:50.416 --> 30:55.021
We were at the park
just getting high.

30:55.054 --> 30:57.289
I saw those kids.

30:57.323 --> 31:00.927
I said to John-John,
"Check out those geeks."

31:00.960 --> 31:03.963
And he walked over to them,
and he shot them.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.035
Why?

31:09.068 --> 31:10.903
I don't know.

31:10.937 --> 31:14.140
He has a very short fuse
sometimes.

31:16.642 --> 31:20.046
All he would say
was that they deserved it.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.364
Thank you for
meeting me, Ms. Sloan.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.466
I have to get back
to work pretty soon.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.468
What's this about?

31:42.501 --> 31:46.172
You went to a hospital
back in January.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.240
You told them
you had been raped.

31:50.109 --> 31:53.045
I, uh, took it back,
said I made a mistake.

31:53.079 --> 31:57.016
There was a man working odd jobs
in your building at the time.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.151
His name is Justin Armel.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.521
I, uh... I-I don't know him.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.256
Are you sure, Ms. Sloan?

32:07.493 --> 32:09.461
You're not the first woman
he's raped.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.365
I didn't say he raped me.

32:13.399 --> 32:16.302
We can put him in jail
if you press charges.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.370
I, uh, I made a mistake
coming here.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.106
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.240
He'll do it again.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.443
You know he will.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.523
He raped before, but he was
out free when he raped me?

32:37.556 --> 32:39.025
Is that what you're saying?

32:40.492 --> 32:42.428
But this time,
you'll put him away?

32:42.461 --> 32:44.496
This time, he won't come back?

32:44.530 --> 32:46.365
Yes, I promise.

32:49.535 --> 32:52.738
He said he'd kill me
if I talked.

32:52.771 --> 32:55.174
And I believed him,

32:55.207 --> 32:58.044
'cause he beat the crap
out of me when he said it.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.584
I'm sorry.

33:10.389 --> 33:11.690
(sighs)

33:18.497 --> 33:19.798
She won't do it.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.467
She was our best shot.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.335
We have nothing.

33:23.369 --> 33:26.572
I understand.

33:26.605 --> 33:29.375
Dad, you okay?

33:29.408 --> 33:31.410
I'm fine, sweetie.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.417
You don't
have to carry

33:38.450 --> 33:40.419
the weight of this
on your shoulders.

33:40.452 --> 33:43.622
If we finesse it, the press
might not even pick up on it.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.534
Have a seat, John-John.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.703
Sure.

33:59.338 --> 34:00.439
Actually, why don't you stand.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.608
(laughs)
This guy is nuts.

34:02.641 --> 34:04.610
Yeah, he gets pissed off
when people shoot people.

34:04.643 --> 34:05.644
Well, I didn't shoot anybody.

34:05.677 --> 34:06.645
Yeah, you did.

34:06.678 --> 34:07.779
We got an eyewitness.

34:07.813 --> 34:10.582
You're all done, stupid.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.518
(chuckles)
Yeah, right.

34:12.551 --> 34:13.585
Yeah, that is right.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.587
We just want to know
why you did it.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.156
What was it?

34:17.189 --> 34:18.490
You go psycho or something?

34:19.391 --> 34:20.559
Come on, just-just tell us

34:20.592 --> 34:21.760
what happened, okay?

34:21.793 --> 34:24.730
That way, you can still have
time to get a psych defense.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.265
I'm not crazy.

34:26.298 --> 34:27.766
So you had a reason.

34:27.799 --> 34:28.867
Oh.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.469
Well, what was it?

34:30.502 --> 34:31.837
We hear they deserved it.

34:31.870 --> 34:32.871
What'd they do?

34:32.904 --> 34:35.874
What'd they do, John-John?

34:35.907 --> 34:37.276
Huh?

34:37.309 --> 34:39.411
What, they call you names
or something?

34:39.445 --> 34:41.313
Oh, they did, huh?

34:41.347 --> 34:42.481
What'd they call you?

34:42.514 --> 34:43.582
They call you ugly?

34:43.615 --> 34:45.351
They call you dumb?

34:45.384 --> 34:46.552
Hmm?

34:46.585 --> 34:47.819
Come on, you can talk to me.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.121
I understand.

34:49.155 --> 34:50.756
When I was in high school,
the kids--

34:50.789 --> 34:52.591
they called me names, too.

34:52.624 --> 34:55.327
You know what they called me?

34:55.361 --> 34:56.462
Stumpy.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.197
It drove me nuts.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.898
Something to do
with respect, huh?

34:59.931 --> 35:01.733
Some people don't get respect.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.602
You get it, don't you?

35:03.635 --> 35:05.504
Yeah, you get respect.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.506
I understand.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.841
See, when I was in high school,
there was this one kid

35:09.875 --> 35:13.179
who just would not stop
calling me Stumpy.

35:13.212 --> 35:14.680
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you? Yeah.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.215
You know what I did to him?

35:16.248 --> 35:19.818
I smashed his face
into the toilet.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.553
What'd they call you, John-John?

35:22.588 --> 35:24.290
Nothing.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.358
Then why'd you do it?

35:28.560 --> 35:29.661
She said, "Why'd you do it?"

35:31.697 --> 35:33.499
You don't want
to talk to me?

35:33.532 --> 35:34.500
Okay.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.802
Like I said, we got a witness.

35:36.835 --> 35:37.836
Your girlfriend.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.539
You spoken to her lately?

35:42.574 --> 35:43.609
'Cause we have.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.678
She had a whole lot to say
about you, John-John.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.314
Either way,
you're going to prison.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.282
Th-They-They were
laughing at me.

35:50.316 --> 35:51.250
They were laughing?

35:51.283 --> 35:52.551
Yeah.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.619
So you shot them?

35:55.354 --> 35:58.924
Like, n-nobody, uh,
laughs at me!

35:58.957 --> 36:00.926
Nobody.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.634
Why was Cinderella
thrown off the team?

36:08.667 --> 36:11.703
What?

36:14.406 --> 36:17.743
Because she ran away
from the ball.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.779
You stupid son of a bitch!
Danny! Danny!

36:20.812 --> 36:22.514
It was a joke!

36:22.548 --> 36:24.450
They weren't laughing at you,
they were laughing at a joke!

36:24.483 --> 36:25.451
Danny, let's go! Out!

36:25.484 --> 36:26.918
It was a joke!
Out, out!

36:26.952 --> 36:28.954
Out!

36:30.856 --> 36:32.858
He killed the kids
for nothing, Jackie.

36:32.891 --> 36:33.525
I know.
You were right.

36:33.559 --> 36:34.693
He killed them
for nothing.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.228
Okay, calm down.

36:36.262 --> 36:37.496
(sighs)

36:37.529 --> 36:39.531
Stay right here.
I'll take the statement.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.614
FRANK:
Good afternoon.

36:55.647 --> 36:57.849
Thanks for coming.

36:57.883 --> 37:01.253
First of all,
in the case of Miles Thomas,

37:01.287 --> 37:05.524
clearly mistakes were made by
the district attorney's office,

37:05.557 --> 37:09.661
compounded by the jury
that convicted him.

37:09.695 --> 37:14.833
As the arresting officer
in the case,

37:14.866 --> 37:17.769
I take full responsibility
for my part

37:17.803 --> 37:19.738
in this miscarriage of justice.

37:19.771 --> 37:23.942
I am... deeply sorry.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.278
(reporters clamoring)

37:26.312 --> 37:27.946
Commissioner, how do you
feel about your role

37:27.979 --> 37:29.715
in sending an innocent man
to prison?

37:31.750 --> 37:33.819
How do I feel?

37:33.852 --> 37:34.653
Seriously?

37:34.686 --> 37:36.021
Did you just get here?

37:36.054 --> 37:36.988
(reporters clamoring)

37:37.022 --> 37:38.724
Commissioner,
if Miles Thomas is innocent,

37:38.757 --> 37:42.628
what's being done to bring
the real rapist to justice?

37:42.661 --> 37:47.999
Edward Hale once said,
"I am only one, but I am one.

37:49.668 --> 37:53.439
"I cannot do everything,
but I can do something.

37:53.472 --> 37:57.343
"And I will not let
what I cannot do

37:57.376 --> 37:59.811
interfere with what I can do."

37:59.845 --> 38:01.847
Can you be more specific?

38:01.880 --> 38:03.549
No.

38:03.582 --> 38:04.616
(reporters clamoring)

38:04.650 --> 38:06.718
The case is now back in
the hands of the court.

38:06.752 --> 38:11.056
Uh, I'm happy to announce that
we do have a suspect in custody

38:11.089 --> 38:12.824
for the park shootings.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.536
Mr. Armel.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.004
You know who I am?

38:26.037 --> 38:28.340
Yeah.

38:28.374 --> 38:29.975
The police
commissioner.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.843
That's right.
Shake my hand.

38:31.877 --> 38:32.844
MAN:
Hello, Commissioner!

38:32.878 --> 38:33.879
Hi, how are you?

38:35.113 --> 38:37.783
I'm watching you, Mr. Armel.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.919
As are the 35,000 cops
who work for me.

38:40.952 --> 38:43.021
Every move you make,

38:43.054 --> 38:45.123
we got your back.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.825
Understand?

38:59.738 --> 39:01.740
(rap music playing faintly)

39:05.577 --> 39:08.880
So you decided to let her go,
after all?

39:08.914 --> 39:11.383
Well, I had to let her know
I trust her.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.852
Mm. That why we're
sitting here watching her?

39:13.885 --> 39:15.987
Well, we're not
going to tell her that.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.022
Mm.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.992
You think she's gonna find
out that we're spying on her?

39:21.026 --> 39:23.094
Nah. She's not
the suspicious type.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.763
Though I am.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.398
So I ran all her friends.

39:26.432 --> 39:27.433
They're clean.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.971
What'd Dad think if he saw us
doing this right now?

39:33.004 --> 39:34.973
Dad?

39:35.006 --> 39:36.908
Do you remember
Benny Allegretti?

39:36.942 --> 39:38.744
Yeah, I remember-- how do you...

39:38.777 --> 39:39.711
Your first date.

39:39.745 --> 39:42.147
Me and Dad--
we followed you the whole night.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.550
Of course, that was after
Grandpa ran his entire family

39:44.583 --> 39:46.952
through BCI to make sure
there were no criminal ties.

39:46.985 --> 39:47.953
You're kidding.

39:47.986 --> 39:50.756
No. You went to see
Sleepless in Seattle.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.023
He sprung for popcorn
and a soda.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.125
You sat on the right,
he sat on the left.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.761
He put his right arm
over your shoulder...

39:55.794 --> 39:57.429
Okay, okay, okay, stop.
Just move the car.

39:57.463 --> 39:59.665
What? It was 20 years ago.
Just move it.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.700
What are you getting
so sensitive for?

40:01.733 --> 40:03.001
It was 20 years ago!
It's creepy!

40:03.034 --> 40:04.970
Creepy.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.439
No, what's creepy is him
trying to kiss you good night.

40:07.473 --> 40:08.507
(groans)

40:08.540 --> 40:10.075
Right on the front stoop.

40:15.981 --> 40:18.917
(laughter, chattering)
