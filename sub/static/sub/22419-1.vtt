00:36.503 --> 00:37.569
Are you cold?

00:37.571 --> 00:40.472
Mm-hmm.
Yes, it's cold today.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.176
But inside
it's going to be warm.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.278
I promise.

00:57.290 --> 00:59.792
What are they reading today?

01:02.328 --> 01:04.196
Hey. Hello.
How are you?

01:04.197 --> 01:06.632
Hey, mommy's going
to the bathroom, okay?

01:06.634 --> 01:08.834
Thank you. Sorry.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.464
Amanda?

02:15.335 --> 02:16.768
Amanda?

02:18.705 --> 02:20.772
Amanda?

02:21.841 --> 02:23.709
Baby?

02:28.381 --> 02:29.448
Baby?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.850
Where... Amanda!

02:35.755 --> 02:37.556
Baby?

02:38.291 --> 02:40.826
Amanda!

02:41.494 --> 02:43.595
Amanda!

02:43.597 --> 02:45.264
Oh, where are you?

02:45.266 --> 02:46.899
Where are you?

02:46.901 --> 02:48.467
Baby!

02:48.668 --> 02:51.537
Ba... babe!

02:51.539 --> 02:53.272
Where are you?!

02:53.274 --> 02:54.940
Where is everybody?

02:55.308 --> 02:57.442
Amanda!

04:31.938 --> 04:34.373
<i> ...six, nine. Over.</i>

04:34.375 --> 04:39.478
<i> Three, four, three</i>
<i> six, nine. Over.</i>

04:39.480 --> 04:42.014
<i>Three, four, three, six...</i>

04:42.016 --> 04:42.914
<i> Okay.</i>

04:42.916 --> 04:44.683
<i>- Wait, wait, wait.</i>
<i>- What? What?</i>

04:44.685 --> 04:46.618
<i> -All right? You got it?</i>
<i> -Okay.</i>

04:46.620 --> 04:48.687
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

04:48.689 --> 04:49.521
<i> Oh.</i>

04:49.523 --> 04:50.589
<i> I am strong, yeah?</i>

04:50.591 --> 04:51.823
<i> -I am strong.</i>
<i> -Yes, you are.</i>

04:51.825 --> 04:54.793
<i> -Baby, you are.</i>
<i> -You're being sarcastic.</i>

04:54.795 --> 04:55.794
<i> Damn you.</i>

04:55.796 --> 04:57.029
- <i> -Damn you.</i>

04:57.031 --> 04:58.630
<i> -See? That.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

04:58.632 --> 05:00.499
<i> What?</i>
<i> -That right there.</i>

05:00.501 --> 05:02.034
<i> What?</i>
<i> -That smile.</i>

05:02.036 --> 05:03.535
<i> It's gonna be</i>
<i> the end of me.</i>

05:03.537 --> 05:06.071
<i> Hey, you're ignoring</i>
<i> the question.</i>

05:06.073 --> 05:09.308
<i> -What? Why you?</i>
<i> -Yes.</i>

05:09.310 --> 05:11.810
<i> Because you're</i>
<i> everything I'm not.</i>

05:13.346 --> 05:16.982
<i> Because of how you seem</i>
<i>to make everything better.</i>

05:19.619 --> 05:22.754
<i> Because ever since</i>
<i> I saw you, I...</i>

05:22.756 --> 05:24.656
<i> I just knew. I knew...</i>

05:24.658 --> 05:28.060
<i> You were the last thing</i>
<i>I wanted to see at night...</i>

05:28.062 --> 05:30.729
<i> And the first thing</i>
<i> I wanted to wake up to</i>

05:30.731 --> 05:32.898
<i> for the rest of my life.</i>

05:33.599 --> 05:35.334
<i> -My turn.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

05:35.336 --> 05:35.734
<i> Yeah.</i>

05:35.736 --> 05:38.603
<i> You see, I firmly</i>
<i> believe that in life,</i>

05:38.605 --> 05:40.405
<i> we develop</i>
<i> these connections,</i>

05:40.407 --> 05:45.911
<i>and the best way to spend</i>
<i> that lifetime...</i>

05:46.446 --> 05:48.980
<i>Is enjoying those connections.</i>

05:48.982 --> 05:51.483
<i>So, for all these reasons, I...</i>

05:51.584 --> 05:54.920
<i> I never want to miss</i>
<i> a connection with you.</i>

06:38.098 --> 06:38.964
Hey.

06:38.966 --> 06:42.167
You sure your head's
in the right spot?

06:42.735 --> 06:44.169
What kind of question
is that?

06:44.171 --> 06:46.471
It's a practical one,
man.

06:46.473 --> 06:49.074
Well, would I be doing
this if it wasn't?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.609
I mean,
it's been two years,

06:50.611 --> 06:52.411
and things haven't
gotten better.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.812
How is she?

06:55.815 --> 06:58.517
She's trying, Thomas.

06:58.651 --> 07:00.552
She's trying.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.521
You seem fine.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.457
Yeah, one day at a time,
you know?

07:07.693 --> 07:09.094
Josh...

07:09.862 --> 07:11.563
It's not
your fault, man.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.599
Well, it's not
hers either. So, just drop it.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.435
I'm just saying
that I get it.

07:16.437 --> 07:17.869
All right,
your child was abducted.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.772
That's not your fault,
nor is it hers, man.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.040
We're this close, and you're
willing to flush

07:22.042 --> 07:24.509
seven years of research
down the fucking drain on this?

07:24.511 --> 07:26.812
She was
my goddamn daughter.

07:27.513 --> 07:28.613
Thomas, she was my kid.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.682
And this is
our research, Josh.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.185
- Can't you see that?

07:33.187 --> 07:34.920
Hey, honey.

07:42.094 --> 07:45.897
Look, I'm really sorry
about what happened.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.733
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

07:48.868 --> 07:49.868
I really am.

07:49.870 --> 07:53.205
We are on the verge
of something huge here.

07:57.143 --> 08:01.112
You can be a real prick
sometimes. You know that, right?

08:02.149 --> 08:04.049
Fucking shit.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.739
Whoa.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.711
<i> Window malfunction.</i>

08:32.712 --> 08:34.279
<i> Please, reset.</i>

08:34.280 --> 08:36.914
Well, that just sucks.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.518
How does this...

08:39.619 --> 08:41.653
- What...
<i>- Window malfunction.</i>

08:41.655 --> 08:42.687
<i> Please, reset.</i>

08:42.688 --> 08:44.289
What happened?

08:50.930 --> 08:52.697
Wow.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.167
Wow.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.904
I guess we can't argue
with that, can we?

08:58.906 --> 09:00.539
Joshua.
-Yeah?

09:00.541 --> 09:01.273
The other trucks are here.

09:01.275 --> 09:02.774
Where do you want the rest
of your shit?

09:02.776 --> 09:04.576
Uh, just tell them
to leave everything

09:04.578 --> 09:05.677
in the basement, please.

09:05.679 --> 09:06.177
Except for that box.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.213
Could you leave that
on the table?

09:15.321 --> 09:17.989
Hey, Isabel.
You liking it?

09:18.190 --> 09:19.257
Okay.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.225
Where do you
want this?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.594
I'll take it.
-What are you doing?

09:22.596 --> 09:23.261
No. No, no.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.763
- No. No.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.631
No, I got it.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.767
<i> Hey,</i>
<i> what are you doing?</i>

09:28.769 --> 09:30.035
<i> Are you trying</i>
<i> to hide from me?</i>

09:30.037 --> 09:32.003
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Are you trying to hide</i>

09:32.005 --> 09:32.604
<i> from daddy?</i>

09:32.606 --> 09:33.972
<i> Are you trying to hide</i>
<i> from daddy?</i>

09:33.974 --> 09:36.575
<i> I'm gonna get you.</i>
<i> Wait, wait, wait, wait!</i>

09:36.577 --> 09:38.610
<i> Wait up for me!</i>
<i> Wait up for me!</i>

09:38.612 --> 09:40.779
<i> Whoa! Hey!</i>

09:40.781 --> 09:41.346
<i> Are you okay, babe?</i>

09:41.348 --> 09:43.715
<i>- Help me. Help me.</i>
<i>- Are you okay?</i>

09:43.717 --> 09:46.184
<i> So,</i>
<i> who do you love most?</i>

09:46.186 --> 09:47.686
<i> -Mommy.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

09:47.688 --> 09:49.020
<i> Did you</i>
<i> just say, "mommy"?</i>

09:49.022 --> 09:50.989
<i> How is this possible?</i>
<i> Who do you...</i>

09:50.991 --> 09:52.724
<i> How much do you</i>
<i> love daddy?</i>

09:52.726 --> 09:54.292
<i> -Little.</i>
<i> -A little?</i>

09:54.294 --> 09:55.627
<i> And mommy?</i>

09:55.629 --> 09:56.361
<i> -A lot.</i>
<i> -A lot?</i>

09:56.363 --> 09:58.730
<i> Come on.</i>
<i> This isn't fair.</i>

09:58.732 --> 10:00.065
<i> So, guess what...</i>

10:00.067 --> 10:01.099
<i> I'm stealing bunny.</i>

10:01.101 --> 10:02.334
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

10:02.336 --> 10:04.102
No, you...

10:22.922 --> 10:24.823
She's beautiful.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.093
She was.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.295
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

10:30.297 --> 10:34.132
Hey, why don't you just
wait in the car for me?

10:34.134 --> 10:36.067
No, no, no.
I'm sorry.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.837
I'm sorry.
You don't have to leave.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.672
I mean...

10:41.674 --> 10:42.741
She is beautiful.

10:42.743 --> 10:46.111
You know what, guys?
I can handle it from here,

10:46.113 --> 10:47.045
so, you should, yeah,

10:47.047 --> 10:48.780
- head back into town. Yeah.
- You sure?

10:48.782 --> 10:49.881
Really appreciate your help.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.282
-Thank you so much.
-Yeah, of course.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.183
Thank you.
-Bye.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.085
Could I talk
to you for a sec?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.420
Yeah, sure.

11:03.996 --> 11:04.696
What?

11:04.698 --> 11:07.065
Look, you know
i didn't mean any harm

11:07.067 --> 11:09.267
by what I said
earlier, man.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.770
I know. I know,
but you have to be careful.

11:11.772 --> 11:15.006
You have to watch what you
say sometimes, Thomas.

11:15.008 --> 11:19.044
I... I just don't want you
to throw it all away.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.080
We're both here
right now, okay?

11:23.749 --> 11:24.215
Right?

11:24.217 --> 11:27.218
I don't want you
to let the guilt consume you.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.219
Look, I'm just saying--

11:28.221 --> 11:31.690
- my fucking Jesus Christ.
- I trust you.

11:31.692 --> 11:32.190
Thomas, please.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.025
-I trust you--
-come on, Thomas.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.062
I appreciate the pep talk,
but, not now.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.830
Promise me, man.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.103
I promise. Okay?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.407
- There you go.
- Yeah.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.142
I mean,
it's also pretty cool

11:51.144 --> 11:53.978
that marconi's paying
for us to live here.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.313
It's a huge plus.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.082
Exactly. Well,
that was all my doing.

11:57.084 --> 12:00.885
So, you buy me a case of beer,
we'll call it even.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.822
We good? Come on.
-I...

12:03.956 --> 12:05.190
Bring it in, sunshine.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.925
I hate you.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.260
Am I interrupting?

12:09.328 --> 12:10.795
No, not at all,
sweetheart.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.464
I'm gonna
head into town.

12:12.466 --> 12:14.265
Okay.
-Give me or Jane a call

12:14.267 --> 12:15.967
if you guys need
anything, all right?

12:15.969 --> 12:16.334
Yeah.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.370
I'll be back up midweek.
We can go over the new test.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.405
Sounds good.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.373
Oh, check this out.

12:22.441 --> 12:23.174
What's this?

12:23.176 --> 12:24.476
It's a new security system.

12:24.478 --> 12:27.412
One, two, six, four.
That's the code.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.213
<i> System active.</i>

12:28.215 --> 12:29.380
You don't want to let
anything in, right?

12:29.382 --> 12:31.049
<i> Thank you, Thomas.</i>
- Cool. Yeah.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.118
-I'm outta here.
-All right.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.486
- Josh...
- Yeah?

12:34.488 --> 12:35.820
One, two, six, four.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.088
Six, four, three, nine.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.256
- Write it down, dude.
- Eight, nine...

12:38.258 --> 12:40.925
It's super hard to get open
once it's locked, all right?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.193
Just go home.
Leave me alone.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.862
- I know you, though.
- Disappear.

12:43.864 --> 12:44.829
All right,
love you, buddy.

12:44.831 --> 12:48.099
- You, too. Bye.
- See ya.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.216
You know I love you, right?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.262
Yes.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.197
I know.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.098
How'd you sleep?

16:09.235 --> 16:10.568
Babe.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.072
Hey.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.640
-Hey.
-Hi.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.275
How'd you sleep?

16:17.277 --> 16:19.143
Fine.
Yeah?

16:19.145 --> 16:20.478
Yeah, fine.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.479
Good.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.481
Good. That's good.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.116
I made breakfast.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.117
I know. I saw that.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.719
Yeah, it's there
on the stove.

16:27.721 --> 16:31.055
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.560
I didn't want to wake you.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.261
What's that?

16:37.263 --> 16:39.063
That I didn't want
to wake you.

16:39.065 --> 16:41.399
I thought you
needed the sleep.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.167
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.502
Thank you.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.604
Much appreciated.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.576
Do you
like it here?

16:53.278 --> 16:57.515
We've... we've been here
just one night, Josh.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.152
Yeah.

17:01.154 --> 17:04.622
But it's... it's nice, yes.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.057
Um...

17:06.059 --> 17:08.726
Listen. I have to go
into town today.

17:08.728 --> 17:12.463
Forgot one of the radios
for the report, so...

17:12.664 --> 17:15.633
You're gonna be
by yourself for a bit.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.468
You gonna be okay?

17:18.537 --> 17:20.671
I'll be fine.

17:21.073 --> 17:22.740
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.675
Can I get you anything?

17:31.216 --> 17:32.417
Josh!

17:32.419 --> 17:33.651
Yeah?

17:33.653 --> 17:37.422
Uh, you know,
I'll go with you.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.656
Really?

17:38.658 --> 17:42.326
Yes. Be good to get out.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.563
Okay.
Go get dressed.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.798
Okay.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.206
We can go
to that coffee place.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.841
We can find a coffee place.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.576
We can do that.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.679
What's that, babe?

18:01.681 --> 18:04.782
Just have to figure out
how to do this.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.350
Thomas told me...

18:14.493 --> 18:15.827
Babe?

18:22.501 --> 18:24.135
Hey.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.304
Here.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.272
Thanks.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.644
You know what? I'm fine.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.214
Go into town, yeah?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.348
It was just a panic attack.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.684
It didn't look like
a panic attack, babe.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.120
But it was, okay?

18:42.122 --> 18:46.290
Seriously, Josh,
I'm fine.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.459
Okay.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.527
Okay.

18:49.529 --> 18:53.331
I'll be back
in a few hours, all right?

18:55.801 --> 18:58.302
You sure
you don't want anything?

18:58.304 --> 18:59.737
I'm fine.

19:01.373 --> 19:02.406
Okay.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.274
Yeah, okay.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.675
Just call me
on the land line

19:04.677 --> 19:06.477
if you need anything.

21:43.903 --> 21:47.772
<i>...three, six, nine. Over.</i>

21:47.774 --> 21:52.376
<i>Three, four, three, six, nine.</i>

21:54.947 --> 21:57.448
<i> ...six, nine. Over.</i>

21:57.450 --> 22:02.987

<i>Three, four, three, six, nine.</i>

26:21.847 --> 26:23.347
Josh?

26:24.282 --> 26:25.683
Babe?

26:25.685 --> 26:27.751
I'm here!

26:28.153 --> 26:29.653
Hey.

26:30.055 --> 26:32.289
Hey. I'm down here!

26:32.291 --> 26:34.091
Baby?

26:34.159 --> 26:36.327
Who is out there?

26:36.329 --> 26:37.094
Hey!

26:39.064 --> 26:40.264
Hey!

26:40.932 --> 26:42.700
Hey, I'm here!

26:44.270 --> 26:45.936
Fuck. Hey.

26:48.907 --> 26:51.809
Josh! Who is there?! Fuck!

26:53.845 --> 26:56.146
Hey! Hey! Hey!

26:56.148 --> 26:58.349
Who is there?!

26:59.017 --> 27:00.951
Fuck. Fuck.

27:31.883 --> 27:33.784
What were you doing
down there?

27:33.786 --> 27:34.818
What do you mean?

27:34.820 --> 27:36.387
Somebody locked me
down there.

27:36.389 --> 27:40.157
Isabel, we're alone.
There's no one around.

27:40.258 --> 27:41.959
Wait. Did you
lock me down there?

27:41.961 --> 27:42.893
Did I lock you down there?

27:42.895 --> 27:44.828
Yeah, yeah,
i locked you down there.

27:44.830 --> 27:45.829
Well, I mean,
someone did.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.831
Why the fuck would i
lock you down in a crawl space?

27:47.833 --> 27:49.700
As you say,
nobody's here.

27:49.702 --> 27:50.701
Yeah, there's no one around.

27:50.703 --> 27:51.735
What are you thinking?

27:51.737 --> 27:53.370
I don't know. I got home.
I'm tired,

27:53.372 --> 27:55.706
and you're down there
crying and screaming,

27:55.708 --> 27:58.208
and I pull you out.
Did you take your...

27:58.210 --> 28:00.744
Did you take
your pills today?

28:03.815 --> 28:05.382
Fuck you.

31:39.297 --> 31:41.899
I'm sorry. I...

31:43.334 --> 31:44.968
It's fine.

31:46.070 --> 31:49.973
No, it's not.
It's not.

32:02.120 --> 32:06.556
Just... it's not
the same here, you know?

32:06.558 --> 32:07.391
I know.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.092
I know.

32:09.560 --> 32:13.196
It's a chance for us
to start over.

32:14.399 --> 32:18.402
We can heal together.
We can grow. We can...

32:20.004 --> 32:22.606
Josh, I'm not a little kid.

32:23.474 --> 32:26.410
I know you're afraid
i will do it again.

32:26.412 --> 32:27.411
No.

32:27.413 --> 32:28.178
It's not something

32:28.180 --> 32:31.415
you can just sweep
under the rug.

32:33.251 --> 32:35.152
I tried to kill myself.

32:38.556 --> 32:41.124
I tried to kill myself.

32:41.960 --> 32:42.726
Stop.

32:42.728 --> 32:46.463
Josh, say...

32:47.231 --> 32:52.035
"Isabel tried
to kill herself."

32:53.538 --> 32:54.638
Stop. You're
being ridiculous. I--

32:54.640 --> 32:57.741
you cannot pretend
it didn't happen, okay?

32:57.743 --> 33:00.344
I make our family
and friends uncomfortable.

33:00.346 --> 33:01.411
- What? No.
- I get that.

33:01.413 --> 33:05.349
- No, that's not it.
- Yeah. But for you--

33:08.386 --> 33:10.454
or maybe...

33:11.689 --> 33:13.590
It's the fact that...

33:14.392 --> 33:16.560
I lost our daughter.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.696
That's the... Josh.

33:19.698 --> 33:23.066
Or maybe you
can't face the facts,

33:23.068 --> 33:25.168
and that's why
you feel it's necessary

33:25.170 --> 33:29.039
to keep me away
in this fucking house.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.474
Look at me.

33:32.110 --> 33:33.577
Josh...

33:33.778 --> 33:34.711
Say it!

34:52.389 --> 34:53.824
Fuck.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.559
Josh?

38:40.652 --> 38:41.985
Hey, babe. Isabel.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.353
- Hmm?
- Hey, wake up.

38:43.355 --> 38:44.487
Come downstairs
to the lab.

38:44.489 --> 38:45.622
We found something.
-What?

38:45.624 --> 38:49.459
<i> Signal strength</i>
<i> now operating at 95%.</i>

38:49.461 --> 38:51.695
Hey. Hey.

38:52.029 --> 38:53.730
Isabel, come on!

38:53.732 --> 38:54.497
Hurry up.

38:54.499 --> 38:55.999
<i> I.D. Confirmed.</i>

38:56.001 --> 38:57.033
<i> Welcome, Isabel.</i>

38:57.035 --> 38:59.502
- What is it?
- We got it.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.970
You got what?

39:01.072 --> 39:02.539
We got it.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.740
You got what?

39:03.742 --> 39:05.542
We got the signal.

39:06.911 --> 39:09.045
Wait. The...

39:09.680 --> 39:10.547
That signal?

39:10.549 --> 39:13.583
Yeah, like from
another world.

39:20.692 --> 39:25.762
<i> Signal strength</i>
<i> now operating at 100%.</i>

39:25.764 --> 39:28.064
Okay, so,
so, what we did, we, um...

39:28.066 --> 39:30.600
We cross-referenced
every shortwave station

39:30.602 --> 39:31.935
across the planet.
You know what

39:31.937 --> 39:33.770
they all had in common?

39:34.572 --> 39:35.438
The same signal.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.773
They've been
transmitting from earth

39:36.775 --> 39:39.442
since as far back
as the records can take us.

39:39.444 --> 39:41.111
And each signal,
um, is hidden

39:41.113 --> 39:42.078
within our own
communication.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.547
So, we took the data
of every single station

39:44.549 --> 39:46.716
across the planet.
So, that just gave us

39:46.718 --> 39:48.718
a clear picture
of where it was coming from.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.620
It's almost like
putting the puzzle together.

39:50.622 --> 39:53.022
Some of the signals
are stronger than others,

39:53.024 --> 39:54.424
but when they're
all combined,

39:54.426 --> 39:57.460
it gives us the coordinates
to ngc-6809.

39:57.462 --> 39:59.963
Ngc-6809
is the same galactic cluster

39:59.965 --> 40:03.166
that SETI received
a signal from back in '77.

40:03.168 --> 40:06.536
It's been under our noses
the whole time.

40:06.538 --> 40:09.939
Babe,
the whole fucking time.

40:10.909 --> 40:11.708
Nine years.

40:11.710 --> 40:15.111
Nine years, buddy, and it
all comes down to this.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.147
Tens of thousands
of light-years away.

40:17.149 --> 40:19.916
<i> 5% loss</i>
<i> in signal strength.</i>

40:19.918 --> 40:23.953
Now operating at 95%.

41:01.625 --> 41:02.492
Hey.

41:02.494 --> 41:04.527
-Hi.
-You found it.

41:04.529 --> 41:05.562
It's so lovely.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.530
-You like it?
-You shouldn't have.

41:07.532 --> 41:10.567
I wanted to.
Really did.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.671
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.706
I'm so proud of you.

41:19.076 --> 41:21.211
What? What?

41:21.645 --> 41:22.512
Oh.

41:25.616 --> 41:26.816
I'd like to thank everybody

41:26.818 --> 41:28.184
for driving all the way
out here tonight

41:28.186 --> 41:30.987
to celebrate something
that is so dear to us.

41:30.989 --> 41:34.023
Josh and I have been
working for this company

41:34.025 --> 41:36.493
for over nine years now.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.127
I propose a toast.

41:38.129 --> 41:41.831
To Josh,
for his perseverance

41:41.833 --> 41:43.032
and never giving up,

41:43.034 --> 41:45.502
so that we can
scientifically prove

41:45.504 --> 41:47.270
the shortwave signal
we found

41:47.272 --> 41:50.206
is indeed not of this earth.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.008
And to his lovely wife Isabel,

41:52.010 --> 41:55.712
for letting us borrow him
long enough to get here.

41:55.714 --> 41:58.982
And also
to my smoking-hot wife...

41:58.984 --> 42:01.918
For putting up with my shit
the past nine years

42:01.920 --> 42:03.887
and not having me committed.

42:03.889 --> 42:05.655
I love you, babe.

42:06.023 --> 42:06.890
Here's to the future.

42:06.892 --> 42:09.993
You know, really,
really great work, Josh.

42:09.995 --> 42:11.060
I can't begin to express

42:11.062 --> 42:13.296
how amazed I am
with the two of you.

42:13.298 --> 42:14.831
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

42:14.833 --> 42:18.735
I really appreciate it.
I'm really excited.

42:18.737 --> 42:19.002
Yeah.

42:19.004 --> 42:21.871
You wanted to talk
to me about something?

42:21.873 --> 42:23.106
Yeah. Uh...

42:23.108 --> 42:27.877
There is something
that I have to tell you.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.979
Go ahead. Shoot.

42:30.114 --> 42:32.682
It's an interesting
painting, huh?

42:32.684 --> 42:36.719
Yes, it is.

42:39.957 --> 42:42.692
What do you think it means?

42:43.928 --> 42:46.596
Uh, I have no idea.

42:47.631 --> 42:49.599
Okay. So, what if
something from deep space

42:49.601 --> 42:52.802
was trying to communicate
with someone on earth?

42:52.804 --> 42:57.040
What if we haven't been
looking in the right place?

42:57.042 --> 43:00.677
I mean, we've been so obsessed
with looking outwards,

43:00.679 --> 43:02.111
when all we had to do
was just look

43:02.113 --> 43:04.714
into our own backyards
to find these answers.

43:04.716 --> 43:08.351
Listen, I'm not 100% sure
that I'm following you here.

43:08.353 --> 43:09.586
Let me put it this way.

43:09.588 --> 43:12.855
Have you ever skipped a rock
over a pond?

43:12.857 --> 43:13.289
Sure. Of course.

43:13.291 --> 43:16.125
Yeah, of course.
So, what happens?

43:16.127 --> 43:17.160
Uh...

43:17.162 --> 43:18.962
Sometimes
they make it across,

43:18.964 --> 43:20.730
and sometimes they sink.

43:20.732 --> 43:21.998
But they do make it across...

43:22.000 --> 43:25.735
If it hits the right angle
and you throw it hard enough.

43:25.737 --> 43:27.203
Correct?
-Uh, yeah.

43:27.205 --> 43:31.374
Each time
the rock hits the surface...

43:32.042 --> 43:33.209
It creates a ripple,

43:33.211 --> 43:35.979
and that ripple
travels onwards,

43:35.981 --> 43:38.247
and eventually
it dissipates on the shore.

43:38.249 --> 43:43.152
However, since a sphere
has no edges,

43:43.154 --> 43:44.954
there's nothing
stopping this ripple

43:44.956 --> 43:47.123
from traveling
indefinitely.

43:47.125 --> 43:48.691
Yeah, okay,
so think about the fish...

43:48.693 --> 43:51.027
Uh-huh.
-At the bottom of the pond.

43:51.029 --> 43:51.628
Okay.

43:51.630 --> 43:53.262
They can feel
the vibrations...

43:53.264 --> 43:54.130
I'm sure they can, yeah.

43:54.132 --> 43:57.000
Yeah. So, eventually
they'll get curious,

43:57.002 --> 43:59.102
and they'll swim up
to the surface

43:59.104 --> 44:00.903
to investigate what's going on.

44:00.905 --> 44:02.071
Sometimes
it could be food.

44:02.073 --> 44:04.907
Perhaps it's rain, and sometimes
it could be nothing,

44:04.909 --> 44:08.011
but one way or another...

44:08.212 --> 44:10.413
They're gonna get an answer.

44:14.418 --> 44:18.087
We're the fish, Robert.

44:19.189 --> 44:23.960
<i> I.D. Confirmed.</i>
<i> Welcome, Isabel.</i>

44:26.430 --> 44:30.767
I followed the vibrations up,
and I found something else.

44:32.302 --> 44:33.936
You found
another signal.

44:33.938 --> 44:36.105
I found the signal.
It's a hidden signal. It's weak,

44:36.107 --> 44:38.441
but it uses our own
communication traffic,

44:38.443 --> 44:41.277
and it's projected
somewhere into the universe,

44:41.279 --> 44:44.013
and something is using
our own language

44:44.015 --> 44:47.350
as a tool to send
a message back into space.

44:47.352 --> 44:50.887
I don't... back home or,
i don't know.

44:50.889 --> 44:53.156
So, the signal caused
a ripple effect

44:53.158 --> 44:55.091
as it hit the ionosphere,

44:55.093 --> 44:59.062
and parts of the signal
bounced back onto earth.

44:59.064 --> 45:01.898
I don't know. I just, I...

45:03.434 --> 45:05.768
I feel like...

45:05.836 --> 45:08.438
I shouldn't
have found this signal.

45:08.706 --> 45:11.274
What makes you
think that?

45:12.209 --> 45:17.113
Well, because when I decoded
the binary inside the signal...

45:17.481 --> 45:20.149
There was
a message attached.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.088
What did it say?

45:26.190 --> 45:28.191
It was an sos...

45:28.826 --> 45:30.760
Along with
a set of coordinates.

45:30.762 --> 45:34.063
And where did
those coordinates lead?

45:35.399 --> 45:37.100
Here...

45:37.102 --> 45:39.202
This house.

45:40.071 --> 45:45.308
<i> Signal strength</i>
<i> operating at 85%.</i>

45:45.310 --> 45:48.511
You do not share this
with anyone else.

45:48.513 --> 45:50.313
It stays between me and you.

45:50.315 --> 45:51.147
You got that?

45:51.149 --> 45:55.118
Not your wife
and sure as hell not Thomas.

45:55.120 --> 45:58.488
At least not until we figure out
what we're dealing with.

45:58.490 --> 45:59.522
<i> ...six, nine...</i>

45:59.524 --> 46:03.059
There's something here,
isn't there?

46:03.061 --> 46:04.861
There's something here?

46:07.132 --> 46:08.464
First thing Monday morning,

46:08.466 --> 46:10.233
I want you to come
to my office.

46:10.235 --> 46:12.101
All right, bring all your data.

46:12.103 --> 46:15.204
We'll sit down and
go through it together.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.875
Yeah. Sure.

46:18.877 --> 46:20.009
<i> ...nine. Over.</i>

46:20.011 --> 46:22.879
<i> Three, four, three...</i>

46:27.885 --> 46:30.353
Mommy!

46:30.355 --> 46:32.355
Amanda.

46:44.402 --> 46:46.202
We need
to finish this conversation,

46:46.204 --> 46:47.837
but I have had
too many drinks.

46:47.839 --> 46:51.240
Do you mind showing me
to your nearest restroom?

46:51.242 --> 46:53.876
Of course not.
It's the first door

46:53.878 --> 46:55.978
to the left, and...

46:56.046 --> 46:58.581
Perfect. I'll be back.

46:58.583 --> 47:00.016
Sure.

47:07.859 --> 47:08.291
Isabel!

47:12.963 --> 47:15.031
- Hey...

47:15.033 --> 47:17.066
How's your head?

47:19.469 --> 47:22.572
What happened?

47:22.973 --> 47:23.873
You don't remember--

47:23.875 --> 47:24.941
--don't move.

47:24.943 --> 47:28.377
- You attacked Robert.
- What?

47:29.513 --> 47:31.480
I did what?

47:31.482 --> 47:32.348
-You stabbed Robert.
-Hey.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.951
I had to hit you in the head
to stop the whole thing.

47:34.953 --> 47:36.853
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

47:39.890 --> 47:41.090
Baby,
you attacked Robert.

47:41.092 --> 47:42.558
You charged him,
and you stabbed him

47:42.560 --> 47:44.393
with a knife.

47:46.463 --> 47:48.531
You tried to do it
over and over again,

47:48.533 --> 47:49.899
but Thomas
had to stop you.

47:49.901 --> 47:52.235
You honestly
don't remember this?

47:54.004 --> 47:56.038
Is he okay?

47:56.240 --> 47:58.307
Yeah. Yeah,
i guess, babe,

47:58.309 --> 48:02.411
but now we have to...
We have to worry about you.

48:02.913 --> 48:06.115
So first thing in the morning,
we're gonna drive into town,

48:06.117 --> 48:08.317
and we're gonna see
your doctors.

48:08.319 --> 48:09.619
I'll give you guys
some privacy.

48:09.621 --> 48:12.488
I'm gonna clean up.
Come on, babe.

48:52.062 --> 48:52.995
<i> Mommy!</i>

49:07.010 --> 49:08.311
We have to go.

49:08.313 --> 49:11.113
No. We have to stay.

49:11.115 --> 49:13.316
Come on, Isabel.

49:13.318 --> 49:14.083
You have
five minutes.

49:14.085 --> 49:17.219
I'll be waiting in the car.
Just get ready.

49:17.654 --> 49:19.388
I saw her.

49:19.723 --> 49:21.691
I saw our daughter.

49:31.435 --> 49:32.568
What did you just say?

49:32.570 --> 49:35.571
I know. I know it sounds
absolutely crazy,

49:35.573 --> 49:37.206
but I remember now.

49:37.208 --> 49:40.242
I don't know
what I did to Robert,

49:40.244 --> 49:41.510
but I went somewhere.

49:41.512 --> 49:43.079
What are you
talking about?

49:43.081 --> 49:44.146
Uh...

49:44.148 --> 49:45.348
-The radios.
-What about it?

49:45.350 --> 49:48.551
Uh, at the party,
i was in the bedroom,

49:48.553 --> 49:50.186
I was sitting
on the bed,

49:50.188 --> 49:53.122
and I start hearing, and...

49:53.124 --> 49:54.991
-And then--
-then what?

49:54.993 --> 49:57.994
And then
i went somewhere...

50:00.163 --> 50:02.164
And I saw her.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.768
I saw our baby.

50:07.738 --> 50:09.005
Go get ready.

50:09.007 --> 50:11.040
Go get dressed.
We're gonna be late.

50:11.042 --> 50:12.041
Okay? Just go.

50:12.043 --> 50:13.275
You don't believe me?

50:13.277 --> 50:15.144
What am i
supposed to say?

50:15.146 --> 50:16.412
I want you to say
you believe me.

50:16.414 --> 50:20.316
Well, how am I supposed
to believe that you saw...

50:20.650 --> 50:22.752
Aman... how?

50:23.420 --> 50:25.721
- Come on.
- Josh...

50:27.557 --> 50:33.496
You know there is
something wrong in this house.

50:36.533 --> 50:38.100
So...

50:39.169 --> 50:41.670
-Play it again.
-What?

50:42.572 --> 50:44.440
The shortwave.

50:45.175 --> 50:49.378
I'm not leaving this house
till you play it.

50:50.580 --> 50:52.081
Josh...

50:54.551 --> 50:57.319
You're sure
you wanna do this?

50:58.755 --> 51:00.256
Yes.

51:03.393 --> 51:04.794
Okay.

51:15.839 --> 51:17.373
Wait.

51:19.843 --> 51:21.377
Okay.

51:25.248 --> 51:29.318
<i> ...three, six, nine.</i>
<i> Over.</i>

51:29.320 --> 51:32.721
<i>Three, four, three, six, nine.</i>
<i> Over.</i>

51:32.723 --> 51:38.594
<i> Signal strength</i>
<i> now operating at 100%.</i>

51:53.243 --> 51:58.314
Isabel Michaels,
i like the sound of that.

51:58.849 --> 52:00.850
- Yeah?
- Yes.

52:01.618 --> 52:04.520
Are you suggesting
something, Ms. layluck?

52:04.522 --> 52:06.322
No.

52:06.324 --> 52:08.524
- No?
- No.

52:09.159 --> 52:10.392
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

52:10.394 --> 52:11.560
Sounds like you are.

52:11.562 --> 52:13.262
No, I promise.

52:14.665 --> 52:17.433
So, this is the world,
right? Okay.

52:17.435 --> 52:18.434
What the frequencies do

52:18.436 --> 52:20.269
is that they bounce back
from the ionosphere,

52:20.271 --> 52:21.570
back and forth,
back and forth.

52:21.572 --> 52:22.338
No, they can't, right?

52:22.340 --> 52:24.640
But they travel around
the world, you know?

52:24.642 --> 52:26.709
-Mm-hmm.
-They travel around the world,

52:26.711 --> 52:28.611
and they are
generated from earth,

52:28.613 --> 52:31.380
and then they bounce
back from there. Yeah.

52:31.382 --> 52:31.847
Mm-hmm.

52:31.849 --> 52:33.516
Bouncing...

52:34.285 --> 52:35.417
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

52:35.419 --> 52:36.819
Hey, babe, babe,
babe, babe.

52:36.821 --> 52:39.155
It's me. It's me.
It's me. It's me.

52:39.157 --> 52:41.790
Hey, hey, hey, it's me.

52:41.792 --> 52:42.691
It's me.

52:42.693 --> 52:43.926
-Breathe.
-Josh.

52:43.928 --> 52:45.828
Breathe. Breathe.

52:45.830 --> 52:47.396
I saw us.

52:47.398 --> 52:49.698
And I saw... as I...

52:49.700 --> 52:52.334
-Shh.
-It happened again...

52:52.670 --> 52:55.638
Just like--
like last night.

52:55.640 --> 52:56.672
Okay. Okay. Okay.

52:56.674 --> 52:59.942
I saw the first time
we met. I...

52:59.944 --> 53:01.510
I don't know how
to explain it, Josh.

53:01.512 --> 53:07.483
It's like I'm reliving
all over again.

53:08.418 --> 53:10.653
You have to believe me.

53:11.421 --> 53:13.789
You have to believe me.

53:13.857 --> 53:15.791
Say you believe me.

53:15.892 --> 53:19.461
Say you believe me.

53:19.463 --> 53:20.329
Hey.

53:20.331 --> 53:21.230
I believe you.

53:21.232 --> 53:23.299
-Okay.
-I believe you.

53:23.301 --> 53:25.568
-I believe you.
-Okay.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.671
If what you're
saying is true...

53:28.673 --> 53:30.306
Which it is.

53:30.308 --> 53:30.873
Which it is.

53:30.875 --> 53:32.474
Then we're looking
at some sort

53:32.476 --> 53:35.377
of frontal-lobe
data reconciliation.

53:35.979 --> 53:37.413
What does that mean?

53:37.415 --> 53:39.848
Basically, it means
that something in the signals

53:39.850 --> 53:41.784
is triggering
your subconscious

53:41.786 --> 53:44.987
to bring up, uh,
lost or repressed memories,

53:44.989 --> 53:48.290
stuff you might have
overlooked in the past.

53:48.292 --> 53:49.792
Think about it this way.

53:49.794 --> 53:53.429
You see this entire room
right now, correct?

53:53.530 --> 53:53.963
Yeah.

53:53.965 --> 53:56.832
But do you
really see it?

53:57.467 --> 53:58.400
What do you mean?

53:58.402 --> 54:00.903
I mean you only see
what you want to.

54:00.905 --> 54:03.772
You're focused on me
at the moment.

54:04.274 --> 54:05.441
What about Josh?

54:05.443 --> 54:08.277
What about all
the plants outside?

54:08.279 --> 54:10.512
Your brain is only
allowing you to see 10%

54:10.514 --> 54:11.580
of the whole picture,

54:11.582 --> 54:13.482
because you're
focused on me.

54:13.484 --> 54:15.651
However, your brain
is still recording

54:15.653 --> 54:17.553
everything around you.

54:17.555 --> 54:19.455
So what are you saying?

54:19.457 --> 54:22.491
I'm saying that I think
whatever is out there

54:22.493 --> 54:23.859
sending these signals

54:23.861 --> 54:26.462
has resonated
with you somehow.

54:26.464 --> 54:27.830
It's formed a connection.

54:27.832 --> 54:30.432
It's allowing you to go
back and see things

54:30.434 --> 54:32.568
that may have
been overlooked.

54:32.570 --> 54:36.472
Sort of like a third-person
observation.

54:37.874 --> 54:39.375
But why?

54:40.443 --> 54:42.311
I wish I knew.

54:43.014 --> 54:46.282
Now, how long did you
say she was unconscious for?

54:46.284 --> 54:48.817
I don't know,
couple seconds tops.

54:48.819 --> 54:51.887
Isabel, how long
were you in that state?

54:52.856 --> 54:55.724
Three
or four minutes.

54:55.726 --> 54:57.059
I don't know.

54:57.061 --> 54:59.395
You know what? We should try
a different signal.

54:59.397 --> 55:02.765
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't think it's a good idea.

55:02.767 --> 55:03.899
Do you think it's safe?

55:03.901 --> 55:06.001
-Yeah.
-You sure?

55:06.003 --> 55:07.670
I promise.

55:07.837 --> 55:08.570
Where's she gonna go?

55:08.572 --> 55:10.973
We're both right here
watching her.

55:10.975 --> 55:13.642
I'm curious whether
a different signal...

55:13.644 --> 55:17.413
Will trigger a different part
of her subconscious.

55:19.049 --> 55:22.751
Baby, i-I'm going
to be okay.

55:23.086 --> 55:27.356
I mean, what if I...

55:27.358 --> 55:30.092
Could see
who took Amanda?

55:31.861 --> 55:35.397
Maybe it's all about that,
you know?

55:35.399 --> 55:38.100
Something out there
is trying to help us,

55:38.102 --> 55:42.538
is pointing us
to the right direction.

55:43.673 --> 55:48.844
We... we could
get her back.

55:50.347 --> 55:53.615
Um, Josh, it's fine.

55:54.584 --> 55:56.585
I'm going to be okay.

55:58.021 --> 56:00.489
Okay. Okay.

56:00.491 --> 56:01.357
Let's do it.

56:01.359 --> 56:04.493
<i> ...three, six, nine.</i>
<i> Over.</i>

56:04.495 --> 56:09.465
<i>Three, four, three, six, nine.</i>
<i> Over.</i>

57:07.457 --> 57:08.590
I loved you.

57:32.483 --> 57:34.082
Why didn't you
save me?

58:03.513 --> 58:04.780
Why doesn't it
work with us?

58:04.782 --> 58:08.717
I don't know. It's gotta
be some sort of cortex trigger.

58:08.719 --> 58:09.885
Something is setting off
memories

58:09.887 --> 58:13.489
- through the signal.
- Is that even possible?

58:13.491 --> 58:14.189
What?

58:14.191 --> 58:16.725
Well, what if it's
not triggering memories?

58:16.727 --> 58:19.094
What if it's triggering
something else?

58:19.096 --> 58:20.762
Well, what are you saying?

58:20.764 --> 58:23.765
What if it's not
triggering memories?

58:23.767 --> 58:25.200
What if it's hallucinations?

58:25.202 --> 58:26.668
What if she's
making it all up?

58:26.670 --> 58:29.738
Maybe this is
just real to her.

58:29.906 --> 58:33.175
I don't know. We shouldn't
go on with this. It's too risky.

58:33.177 --> 58:35.244
What if she has a stroke

58:35.246 --> 58:35.978
or something worse?

58:35.980 --> 58:37.079
We have to consider
the repercussions

58:37.081 --> 58:39.748
- before we go on, tom.
- Then we need to run

58:39.750 --> 58:41.550
some tests on this
in a controlled environment.

58:41.552 --> 58:43.986
She is not
your lab rat, tom.

58:43.988 --> 58:46.655
I'm not saying
that she is, Josh.

58:47.791 --> 58:49.625
You need to fucking--
we need to see

58:49.627 --> 58:51.593
why these signals are resonating
with her and where.

58:51.595 --> 58:55.197
Okay. Can we just keep it
quiet until we get answers?

58:55.199 --> 58:56.798
Yeah, that's fine.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.767
I'm serious. Okay?

58:58.769 --> 59:00.669
Okay.

59:32.836 --> 59:35.337
<i> ...six, nine. Over.</i>

59:35.339 --> 59:40.142
<i>Three, four, three, six, nine.</i>

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:10.432
No.

01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:25.247
Mommy, where are
they taking me?

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:33.422
Babe?

01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:38.060

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:53.375
Babe?

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:57.212
Hey. Hey.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.114
Isabel.

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:00.816
Hey.

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:03.819
Isabel,
can you hear me? Hey.

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:07.889
Uh, babe!

01:02:09.927 --> 01:02:13.361
<i> Access granted.</i>
<i> Thank you, Josh.</i>

01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:15.197
Babe. Babe.

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:21.269
What happened?

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.505
Hey.

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:37.018
Okay, babe, babe...

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.854
Babe, just talk to me.
What happened?

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:40.255
Are you okay?

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.991
Why do you have blood?
What, just talk to me.

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:44.760
Say something.
Say anything.

01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:46.261
You have to help me.

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:46.962
Yeah, I will.

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:48.430
Just give me
your hand. Come on.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:49.831
Come out from
under the table.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.900
I'll help you.
Give me your hand.

01:02:51.902 --> 01:02:53.835
You have to lock the door.

01:02:53.837 --> 01:02:55.137
Lock the door.

01:02:55.139 --> 01:02:57.939
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:02.978
Okay, okay.

They're locked.
You're safe.

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:08.483
Babe, you're safe.

01:03:08.485 --> 01:03:11.920
Nothing's gonna hurt you.
Just give me your hand.

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:13.121
They're here.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.958
They'll...
Go. Go.

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:20.996
No, no.
I can't help you.

01:03:20.998 --> 01:03:22.364
No. No, no, no.

01:03:22.366 --> 01:03:25.100
I can't help you.

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:26.067
Please. Oh, no.

01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:28.069
-Babe.
-I can't move.

01:03:28.071 --> 01:03:30.505
No, no, no.

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:32.374
--What's going on?

01:03:32.376 --> 01:03:34.176
Come on. Babe, I can't--

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:36.845
I can't move.
-Babe.

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:39.147
- Babe!

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:40.949
Oh, my god.

Hello!

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:51.399
Is anyone home?

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.635
Thomas asked me
to leave this.

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:30.625
Jane?

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:32.593
Is anyone here?

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:34.896
You were wrong.

01:15:34.898 --> 01:15:37.665
--Where the hell's my wife?

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:39.834
Put your
fucking hands up!

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:45.206

the whole time.

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:47.675
What?

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:50.144
The signal...

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:54.248
--It's coming from here...

01:15:56.151 --> 01:15:58.119
From this house.

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:03.658
It's inside of me.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:08.563
Thomas, you...
You let them inside of me.

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:12.633
Shit.

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:22.877
Where the hell
is Jane?

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.249
Isabel!

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.653
Isabel!

<i> I.D. Confirmed.</i>

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:01.949
<i> Welcome, Thomas.</i>

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:03.184
Isabel.

01:17:03.186 --> 01:17:05.820
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:10.358
Put it down.

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:18.132
Kick it to me.

01:17:23.906 --> 01:17:25.239
Okay, okay.

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:27.408
Just let her go.
Take me.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:28.275
Please just let her go.

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:30.011
She has nothing
to do with this.

01:17:30.013 --> 01:17:33.648
You knew
they would prey off of me

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:35.850
because I want
my daughter back.

01:17:35.852 --> 01:17:37.652
-No.
-You're lying!

01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:40.121
No, no, wait!
Stop, stop, stop!

01:17:40.123 --> 01:17:41.122
Okay, okay.

01:17:41.124 --> 01:17:43.024
All right.
All right.

01:17:43.026 --> 01:17:44.725
We knew.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.427
Marconi knew.

01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:48.429
We'd never seen someone
who was searching

01:17:48.431 --> 01:17:50.765
for something
so desperately.

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:53.668
Who are they?

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:56.070
We don't know.
Stay there.

01:17:56.072 --> 01:17:57.371
The question was how
to bring them

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:58.839
to our plane of existence.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:01.442
They can only exist here
for moments at a time.

01:18:01.444 --> 01:18:04.078
We'd never seen anything
like this before.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.247
It was
off the fucking map.

01:18:06.249 --> 01:18:07.948
Before?

01:18:09.284 --> 01:18:11.352
How many were there?

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:13.154
Two.

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:18.392
<i> We used that guilt</i>
<i>about your daughter against you.</i>

01:18:18.394 --> 01:18:20.928
<i>That fear, that heightened</i>
<i> sense of awareness,</i>

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:23.698
<i> that's what makes you</i>
<i> susceptible to them.</i>

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.000
<i> We figured that</i>
<i> under the circumstance,</i>

01:18:26.002 --> 01:18:27.034
<i>that you would let them in</i>

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:29.103
<i>if you knew you had a chance</i>
<i> to see her again.</i>

01:18:29.105 --> 01:18:31.072
Shut up!

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:34.008
I can help you.

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:36.010
We can take you in.

01:18:36.012 --> 01:18:37.445
We can remove it
from you.

01:18:37.447 --> 01:18:39.947
These are people's lives.

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.784
You killed Josh.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:48.155
And now,
you're killing me.

01:18:48.157 --> 01:18:51.358
You can't let it out
of this house, Isabel.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.395
I'm leaving this house,
Thomas.

01:18:55.764 --> 01:18:57.865
You would have done it
already if you knew

01:18:57.867 --> 01:18:59.366
it was possible.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:03.738
I know,
'cause I put it there.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.306
You put what where?

01:19:05.308 --> 01:19:08.442
I put a microchip
in the back of your neck.

01:19:08.444 --> 01:19:11.312
It's like
a giant electric fence.

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:12.813
You honestly think
it's a coincidence

01:19:12.815 --> 01:19:15.483
that this house
is in the middle of nowhere?

01:19:15.485 --> 01:19:16.450
It's containment.

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:18.519
Thomas, help me!

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:19.420
Shut up!

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:21.288
No. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:23.224
I never meant for any
of this to happen.

01:19:23.226 --> 01:19:24.925
Please.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:26.260
It's too late.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:27.528
Oh, fuck.

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:30.397
--Please let me help you.

01:19:30.399 --> 01:19:32.867
You have
to fucking believe me.

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:36.337
They're already here.

01:19:43.846 --> 01:19:45.079
Please
don't make me.

01:19:57.993 --> 01:19:59.994
Jane!

01:19:59.996 --> 01:20:02.096
Jane, I'm so sorry.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.822
No. No. No.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:00.047
Ah, you fucking bitch.

01:22:00.049 --> 01:22:02.116
Ah, for Christ's...

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.226
<i> Window malfunction.</i>

01:22:12.228 --> 01:22:13.560
- Fuck!
<i>- Please, reset.</i>

01:22:13.562 --> 01:22:15.663
Open
the goddamn window!

01:22:15.665 --> 01:22:18.165
- Please, I'm begging you.

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:19.566
I'll do anything.

01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:23.437
Okay. Please. I'll take
you to your daughter.

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:26.307
What did you say?

01:22:26.309 --> 01:22:27.441
Your daughter. Please.

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:30.377
I'm sorry. I'll take you there.
She's fine.

01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:31.946
- Why...
- Listen.

01:22:31.948 --> 01:22:33.948
You have my daughter? Why...

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:36.016
Listen, Isabel,
you have to come

01:22:36.018 --> 01:22:38.352
with me right now
before they come back.

01:22:38.354 --> 01:22:39.553
I can help you.

01:22:39.555 --> 01:22:41.255
Where is she?!

01:22:41.257 --> 01:22:42.356
It's okay.

01:22:42.358 --> 01:22:45.492
She's at a research facility
in the city.

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:48.262
Just come with me.
We can help you.

01:22:48.264 --> 01:22:50.397
You can be
with her again.

01:22:52.168 --> 01:22:53.434
No.

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:58.539
I don't want that.

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:01.275
What do you want?

01:23:01.277 --> 01:23:04.311
I don't want that.

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:07.481
What the fuck
do you want?!

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:10.284
We want...

01:23:10.418 --> 01:23:11.685
To be left...

01:23:11.687 --> 01:23:14.421
Alone!

01:23:53.661 --> 01:23:58.632
Just to give hope
to the future generations,

01:23:58.634 --> 01:24:00.534
you know?

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.304
<i>It's... yeah. I told you.</i>

01:24:04.306 --> 01:24:07.608
<i> It's so stupid, I know.</i>
<i> I know. It's just it...</i>

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:11.045
No. No, no, no.
It's not stupid at all.

01:24:11.047 --> 01:24:12.579
I do, too.

01:24:14.582 --> 01:24:18.786
I... I want to answer
all the questions

01:24:18.788 --> 01:24:21.722
<i> that everyone else</i>
<i> is asking and...</i>

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:27.761
<i> Somewhere along the way,</i>
<i>make the world a better place.</i>

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:33.367
<i> If I can pull it off,</i>
<i>which is technically impo...</i>

01:24:33.369 --> 01:24:35.169
Anyways, a toast.

01:24:35.171 --> 01:24:38.072
Okay. A toast.

01:24:41.844 --> 01:24:44.611
To changing the world.

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:54.721
To changing the world.
