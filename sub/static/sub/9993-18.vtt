02:20.967 --> 02:22.900
What are
you doing, huh?

02:22.934 --> 02:25.334
Hey, it's Saturday.

02:25.368 --> 02:26.967
We got another
half hour or so.

02:27.001 --> 02:28.934
Lay back down. Hmm?

02:30.001 --> 02:31.434
I don't think I can.

02:31.468 --> 02:33.167
I... I saw a girl
slip and fall.

02:33.201 --> 02:35.201
I got to call somebody.
What?

02:35.234 --> 02:36.834
Got to find the phone book.

02:36.867 --> 02:37.900
What are you
talking about?

02:37.934 --> 02:39.867
Slipped and fell?

02:39.900 --> 02:42.633
Now you're doing
slips and falls?

02:42.667 --> 02:45.967
What happened to kidnappings
and assaults and murders?

02:46.001 --> 02:47.800
It's a Saturday.

03:33.953 --> 03:36.387
Yes. Mariposa State Park.

03:36.421 --> 03:38.354
She looked like
she was around 18.

03:38.387 --> 03:40.254
She had long blond hair.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.721
She was wearing a white T-shirt

03:41.754 --> 03:43.721
with the name
of some sorority on it.

03:46.888 --> 03:49.788
No. I didn't actually
witness her fall.

03:49.821 --> 03:51.721
ARIEL:
No, it's not.
BRIDGETTE:
Yes, it is.

03:51.754 --> 03:52.920
Well, you have
to show someone.

03:52.953 --> 03:54.053
Like who?

03:54.087 --> 03:55.354
Mom or Dad.

03:55.387 --> 03:56.487
But what if
I don't want to?

03:56.521 --> 03:57.654
Well, you'd better.

03:57.687 --> 03:59.788
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

03:59.821 --> 04:02.320
Your baby sister's
still asleep.

04:07.187 --> 04:08.387
What's this?

04:08.421 --> 04:10.920
It's a class project.

04:10.953 --> 04:12.754
What kind of class project?

04:12.788 --> 04:15.654
Well, we're doing
this art project about what

04:15.687 --> 04:17.721
our parents do for a living.

04:17.754 --> 04:19.454
And I'm doing mine about Mom.

04:19.487 --> 04:22.621
That's nice, Bridge.

04:22.654 --> 04:24.687
Tell him what it means.

04:24.721 --> 04:26.554
What do you mean,
"what it means"?

04:26.587 --> 04:28.187
It's her job.

04:28.220 --> 04:29.554
Okay, I get that.
I'm just curious.

04:29.587 --> 04:31.687
What do you think Mom's job is?

04:31.721 --> 04:34.287
Well, she's a guesser
and a dreamer.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.020
One more time?

04:37.053 --> 04:38.554
Well, she makes guesses
about things,

04:38.587 --> 04:41.120
and sometimes she dreams
about things.

04:41.154 --> 04:44.654
And she tells all this stuff
to District Attorney Devalos,

04:44.687 --> 04:46.788
and he puts people in jail.

04:49.821 --> 04:52.354
I'll be right back.

04:52.387 --> 04:55.053
No, Lee, I know the park
is not your jurisdiction,

04:55.087 --> 04:57.020
but I called Park Services,

04:57.053 --> 04:59.621
and I couldn't seem
to get anyone's attention.

04:59.654 --> 05:03.320
Well, can you
just give him a call?

05:03.354 --> 05:05.554
Okay. Can you call me back?

05:05.587 --> 05:08.320
Thanks.

05:08.354 --> 05:11.053
Hey, have you seen this
class project of Bridgette's?

05:11.087 --> 05:13.120
That collage thing
with the photographs

05:13.154 --> 05:15.320
and pictures from magazines?
No. Not yet.

05:15.354 --> 05:17.854
You might want to take
a look at this thing.

05:17.888 --> 05:19.687
She's got some
pretty eerie ideas

05:19.721 --> 05:21.721
about what you do for a living.

05:21.754 --> 05:25.687
Eerie crazy or eerie accurate?

05:25.721 --> 05:29.154
That's a pretty tough call.

05:29.187 --> 05:31.354
In the kitchen?

05:33.821 --> 05:35.821
We still doing
that Family Day thing?

05:35.854 --> 05:38.220
Yeah. Remember?
We decided to go to the mall.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.220
The mall? It's
so sunny out.

05:40.254 --> 05:42.220
Yeah, well,
it's Arizona, Allison.

05:42.254 --> 05:43.387
It's always sunny.

05:43.421 --> 05:46.154
Well, I know. It...
The mall's so stuffy.

05:46.187 --> 05:47.754
They've been there
a million times.

05:47.788 --> 05:50.220
I kind of want to
do something outdoors.

05:50.254 --> 05:51.821
Experience nature.

05:51.854 --> 05:53.320
Nature? What do you mean?

05:53.354 --> 05:55.621
I don't know.

05:55.654 --> 05:58.287
I thought maybe
we could go to the park.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.788
Go for a hike.

05:59.821 --> 06:01.320
Climb some rocks.

06:06.687 --> 06:09.521
Wow, honey. Is this what you
think Mommy does for work?

06:09.554 --> 06:10.854
Uh-huh.

06:12.354 --> 06:15.053
This would be a good thing
to talk about at the park

06:15.087 --> 06:18.087
while we go for a hike
and climb some rocks.

06:19.454 --> 06:21.587
JOE:
It's great
up here, huh?

06:21.621 --> 06:23.487
It's beautiful!

06:23.521 --> 06:24.654
It's boring.

06:24.687 --> 06:25.754
I don't
understand.

06:25.788 --> 06:27.354
What happened
to the mall?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.487
Didn't we vote?

06:28.521 --> 06:29.953
Isn't this
a democracy?

06:29.987 --> 06:31.521
What'so great about the mall?

06:31.554 --> 06:32.888
What do they have at the mall?

06:32.920 --> 06:34.521
You're joking, right?

06:34.554 --> 06:36.754
How about clothes?!

06:36.788 --> 06:38.621
<i>Well, I hate clothes!</i>

06:38.654 --> 06:41.020
Well, there
is something
wrong with you.

06:41.053 --> 06:43.120
Mom, there's
an emergency.

06:43.154 --> 06:44.554
We have to call
the hospital.

06:44.587 --> 06:47.354
This little girl
is not my sister.

06:47.387 --> 06:49.521
Mom?

06:49.554 --> 06:50.987
Al?

06:52.187 --> 06:54.387
Al?

06:54.421 --> 06:57.154
You know, it
was your idea

06:57.187 --> 06:59.454
to come up here
in the first place.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.854
The very least
you can do

07:00.888 --> 07:05.287
is participate in
the stimulating
conversation.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.953
What are you
looking for?

07:06.987 --> 07:09.554
You guys figure out a place
to have a picnic.

07:09.587 --> 07:12.654
I'll... I want to look
at something.

07:12.687 --> 07:14.154
Okay, I'm confused.

07:14.187 --> 07:17.187
What is it about that sign
that you do not understand?

07:17.220 --> 07:19.220
I'll be right back.

07:20.554 --> 07:22.154
Terrific.

08:01.821 --> 08:03.320
BRIDGETTE:
I don't get it.

08:03.354 --> 08:05.020
Isn't Mommy a guesser
and a dreamer?

08:05.053 --> 08:08.287
There is no job called
a guesser or a dreamer.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.220
Bridgette, Mom works
for the District
Attorney's office

08:10.254 --> 08:12.454
with a lot of other people.

08:12.487 --> 08:15.487
She helps them investigate
things-- figure things out.

08:15.521 --> 08:18.254
So she's
a "figurer"?

08:18.287 --> 08:20.554
ALLISON:
Daddy's right.

08:20.587 --> 08:24.220
I guess I'm kind
of an investigator.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.854
You don't dream?

08:25.888 --> 08:27.187
Well, sure,
I do,

08:27.220 --> 08:28.854
but that's not uncommon.

08:28.888 --> 08:31.854
Lots of people dream about
their work once in a while.

08:31.888 --> 08:36.687
I dream. I think. I feel.
I explore.

08:38.087 --> 08:39.953
And then I follow my instincts.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.854
Which, I guess, is what
a lot of investigators do.

08:42.888 --> 08:45.087
Oh. So, Sherlock,
did you find

08:45.120 --> 08:47.220
whatever it was
you were looking for?

08:47.254 --> 08:50.187
No. In fact, I did not,
which is probably a good thing.

08:50.220 --> 08:52.187
Anybody want

08:52.220 --> 08:53.687
to play Frisbee?

08:53.721 --> 08:55.987
Sure. Marie and I will play,
as long as you promise

08:56.020 --> 08:58.387
to try and throw it
in our general direction.

08:58.421 --> 09:00.120
I can't help it

09:00.154 --> 09:02.754
if the Frisbee
doesn't pay
attention.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.187
Oh, girls, be careful
over there by the rocks.

09:07.220 --> 09:08.687
Look out for snakes.

09:08.721 --> 09:12.821
Hmm. An
investigator, huh?

09:12.854 --> 09:14.888
And what case

09:14.920 --> 09:17.487
are we working on today,
Magnum Dubois?

09:17.521 --> 09:19.320
You figured that out, huh?

09:19.354 --> 09:21.654
You're not the only one
with instincts around here.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.521
That dream that I had...

09:23.554 --> 09:25.821
Slipping? Falling?

09:25.854 --> 09:28.554
I do recall that.

09:28.587 --> 09:31.120
This is where it happened.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.454
At least this is where
I thought it happened.

09:33.487 --> 09:35.454
Damn accident victims.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.554
You just can't
count on them.

09:37.587 --> 09:39.621
That's why I tell all
my investigator wives

09:39.654 --> 09:41.920
to stick with
crime victims.

09:41.953 --> 09:45.053
Kidnap. Murder. Rape.

09:45.087 --> 09:47.421
Horrific,
but dependable.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.587
BRIDGETTE:
Mom! Dad! I found something!

09:49.621 --> 09:51.888
Bridgette?

09:51.920 --> 09:53.487
JOE:
What you got
there, kiddo?

09:53.521 --> 09:55.754
Maybe there's
money in it.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.754
Where did you find this?

09:58.788 --> 10:00.454
Over there.

10:00.487 --> 10:02.053
Ariel! Quick!

10:02.087 --> 10:03.187
Come on.

10:03.220 --> 10:05.554
Sit down. Sit down.

10:05.587 --> 10:07.554
Stay here while your
daddy goes and looks.

10:07.587 --> 10:10.888
What's going
on, Al?

10:10.920 --> 10:14.320
You want to tell me
what I'm looking for?

10:14.354 --> 10:17.020
The rest of her.

10:21.504 --> 10:24.170
I hate family day.

10:24.204 --> 10:27.137
Can we go photocopy
my face again?

10:27.170 --> 10:28.204
You know what, honey,

10:28.237 --> 10:30.204
I don't want to walk
away right now.

10:30.237 --> 10:31.804
I mean, if your father
wants to take you...

10:31.838 --> 10:33.337
You know, we've
already got about six

10:33.370 --> 10:34.771
photocopies of
your face, Bridge.

10:34.804 --> 10:36.404
Tongue in, tongue out,

10:36.437 --> 10:38.304
finger in nose,
finger in ear.

10:38.337 --> 10:39.404
Why don't we just...

10:41.337 --> 10:42.637
I'll be right back.

10:46.904 --> 10:49.370
DEVALOS:
Her name is Amy Asher.
18 years old.

10:49.404 --> 10:51.537
She was an out-of-state freshman
from Wheaton, Illinois.

10:51.571 --> 10:53.737
That's her, that's
the girl I dreamt about,
I called you about.

10:53.771 --> 10:56.370
Wait a second,
you dreamt about this girl?

10:56.404 --> 10:57.871
You actually

10:57.904 --> 11:00.938
saw her being sexually assaulted
and strangled to death

11:00.970 --> 11:03.270
and then you had a conversation
with Detective Scanlon about it

11:03.304 --> 11:04.404
before it ever happened?

11:04.437 --> 11:06.337
No, I dreamt about a girl

11:06.370 --> 11:08.471
climbing really high to try
to spray paint a boulder

11:08.504 --> 11:09.838
and then slipping.
When she called

11:09.871 --> 11:12.103
we had no idea this thing was
going to end up like this.

11:12.137 --> 11:13.604
I called Park Services,

11:13.637 --> 11:16.237
they went looking for a girl
disabled by a fall,

11:16.270 --> 11:17.404
never found her.

11:17.437 --> 11:18.871
Hold on.

11:18.904 --> 11:20.938
You guys know more about this
than I do.

11:21.003 --> 11:23.471
She was sexually assaulted
and strangled?

11:24.671 --> 11:25.704
According to the girls

11:25.737 --> 11:27.970
we spoke to
over at the sorority,

11:28.003 --> 11:30.571
she was sent to paint Skull Rock
as an initiation task.

11:30.604 --> 11:32.504
She left her house
around 4:30 this morning

11:32.537 --> 11:34.404
so she could do it
without being spotted by

11:34.437 --> 11:35.571
the park rangers.

11:35.604 --> 11:37.604
Okay. I had my dream
right after sunrise.

11:37.637 --> 11:39.737
Based on
some very preliminary work,

11:39.771 --> 11:41.170
the folks over at forensics
are saying

11:41.204 --> 11:43.237
it looks like she fell,
she broke her left ankle

11:43.270 --> 11:44.904
and then was dragged to where
your husband found her.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.938
They believe that's where
she was sodomized, raped

11:47.970 --> 11:50.204
and then eventually,
strangled to death.

11:50.237 --> 11:52.504
The attack was apparently
quite savage.

11:52.537 --> 11:55.304
How much did your kids
actually see?

11:55.337 --> 11:56.404
Nothing,
thank goodness.

11:56.437 --> 11:57.704
Joe got there first.

11:57.737 --> 12:00.571
Well, Bridgette found
her backpack.

12:00.604 --> 12:04.137
It was about 15 yards from
where Joe found her body.

12:04.170 --> 12:06.604
We might need to interview
the both of them at some point.

12:06.637 --> 12:07.938
Of course.

12:07.970 --> 12:10.170
What are
the chances?

12:10.204 --> 12:11.437
A girl falls, breaks her ankle

12:11.471 --> 12:13.504
and the one person who happens
to cross her path

12:13.537 --> 12:16.637
is a sexual predator and killer.

12:19.170 --> 12:20.737
Let's get out of here.

12:20.771 --> 12:23.571
Maybe we can salvage
a little of our Saturday.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.204
Anything you can tell me?

12:28.237 --> 12:31.737
Not here, not now.

12:35.571 --> 12:37.337
You okay?

12:37.370 --> 12:39.537
Yeah. It was
pretty grisly.

12:39.571 --> 12:41.871
It was pretty awful.

12:41.904 --> 12:43.771
Her face...

12:43.804 --> 12:46.304
I'm so sorry.

12:46.337 --> 12:47.704
I guess you were right,

12:47.737 --> 12:49.437
we should've gone
to the mall after all.

12:49.471 --> 12:51.137
It's not your fault.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.604
I don't know,
I don't understand.

12:53.637 --> 12:55.370
What? You don't
understand what?

12:55.404 --> 12:59.103
Oh, I'm just thinking
about my instincts--

12:59.137 --> 13:02.471
I had an instinct about
this girl slipping and falling--

13:02.504 --> 13:06.270
and how besides the point
it all seems right now.

13:06.304 --> 13:08.571
It's kind of like sensing

13:08.604 --> 13:10.504
that you're sailing
into a little rain

13:10.537 --> 13:13.037
<i>when you're onboard
the Titanic.</i>

13:14.304 --> 13:16.604
Okay, I get it now.
Mom's an investigator.

13:16.637 --> 13:17.804
But you know what's weird?

13:17.838 --> 13:19.204
Your face?

13:19.237 --> 13:20.871
Nuh-uh.
Us going to the park.

13:20.904 --> 13:22.070
We never go
to that park.

13:22.103 --> 13:24.070
Just 'cause we never go there
doesn't make it weird.

13:29.237 --> 13:31.671
Well, don't you think
it's weird that we went hiking?

13:31.704 --> 13:33.137
Lots of people go hiking.

13:33.170 --> 13:35.571
My friend Rachel Donnelly
goes hiking all the time.

13:35.604 --> 13:37.270
Yeah, but we don't.

13:37.304 --> 13:39.838
What's your point, doofus?

13:39.871 --> 13:42.771
And don't think I
didn't notice you
didn't brush your teeth.

13:42.804 --> 13:44.537
I mean the one time

13:44.571 --> 13:45.704
that we go hiking,

13:45.737 --> 13:48.003
we find a dead body.

13:48.037 --> 13:50.170
Don't you think that is weird?

13:50.204 --> 13:51.671
I think you're weird.

13:51.704 --> 13:53.938
I think this conversation
is weird.

13:53.970 --> 13:55.671
Well, think about it.
Doesn't it

13:55.704 --> 13:57.437
seem like everywhere
Mommy goes

13:57.471 --> 13:59.270
she finds dead bodies?

13:59.304 --> 14:01.938
She told you,
she's an investigator.

14:01.970 --> 14:04.103
Investigators are always
finding dead bodies.

14:04.137 --> 14:05.838
Today was just a coincidence.

14:05.871 --> 14:07.571
I hope so, because

14:07.604 --> 14:10.404
I don't want to grow up and have
kids and have to explain

14:10.437 --> 14:14.604
why their grandma always had
dead bodies hanging around.

14:33.704 --> 14:35.003
Do you forgive me?

14:35.037 --> 14:37.003
Huh?

14:40.170 --> 14:41.838
Do you forgive me?

14:43.904 --> 14:46.938
I forgive you.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.704
What did you do?

14:48.737 --> 14:51.137
I dragged you all
to the park today.

14:51.170 --> 14:54.304
Yeah, well, it still
beats going to the mall.

14:54.337 --> 14:57.938
Putting you and the kids
so close to all that ugliness.

14:57.970 --> 15:01.070
I still can't believe
I did that.

15:01.103 --> 15:03.838
I can't believe you saw
what you saw.

15:03.871 --> 15:06.370
Hey, I can't believe
I saw what I saw.

15:06.404 --> 15:11.137
And frankly, if I never
see another naked girl

15:11.170 --> 15:15.904
with that look of horror
permanently etched on her face,

15:15.938 --> 15:17.170
that's just fine with me.

15:17.204 --> 15:20.304
As for the kids,
Bridgette told me

15:20.337 --> 15:23.671
that she wants a coffee machine
of her own for her birthday.

15:25.704 --> 15:26.871
Darling, I swear,

15:26.904 --> 15:28.737
there's nothing for you
to apologize for.

15:28.771 --> 15:32.170
Just... it'd be nice
to get a little sleep.

17:30.103 --> 17:31.604
Yeah?
Lee, it's Allison.

17:31.637 --> 17:34.103
I'm sorry to wake you.
I need your help with something.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.270
What's going on?

17:36.304 --> 17:37.370
What's wrong?

17:37.404 --> 17:38.604
I had a dream.

17:38.637 --> 17:40.137
This girl was driving through
the desert.

17:40.170 --> 17:43.070
Her car ran out of gas and
her cell phone doesn't work.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.537
Okay.

17:44.571 --> 17:46.003
Well, what do we do?

17:46.037 --> 17:47.637
What do you mean,
what do we do?

17:47.671 --> 17:49.370
It sounds like
a AAA problem to me.

17:49.404 --> 17:51.871
I told you,
her cell phone doesn't work.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.204
Allison, look,
I think you're amazing,

17:54.237 --> 17:57.304
but it's 4:00 in the morning and
I'm a homicide detective.
Oh, I know.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.237
Normally I wouldn't bother you
with something like this,

17:59.270 --> 18:01.671
it's just...
after what happened today...

18:01.704 --> 18:05.003
I don't know, there must be
some reason I saw it.

18:05.037 --> 18:06.537
It has to have some importance.

18:06.571 --> 18:08.871
Well, that's fine, but...

18:11.137 --> 18:13.237
I guess I could
call the highway patrol.

18:13.270 --> 18:16.137
Okay.

18:20.137 --> 18:22.771
Tell me anything specific
you might have seen.

18:22.804 --> 18:24.904
Describe the girl,
describe the car,

18:24.938 --> 18:27.304
describe the road.

18:29.404 --> 18:31.604
<i>( groans ):
Kill me now.</i>

18:31.637 --> 18:33.070
<i>( ringing )
It's Sunday.</i>

18:33.103 --> 18:35.537
Come on, who the hell
is calling this hour

18:35.571 --> 18:37.037
on a Sunday?

18:37.070 --> 18:38.370
Hello?

18:38.404 --> 18:40.437
That girl you called me about
a couple hours ago,

18:40.471 --> 18:42.204
you said she was driving
a silver sedan?

18:42.237 --> 18:43.471
Uh-huh.

18:43.504 --> 18:45.370
I think we found the car.

18:45.404 --> 18:47.270
Trucker called it in last night.
Looks like

18:47.304 --> 18:49.170
it just ran out of gas on
the side of the desert highway

18:49.204 --> 18:51.103
about 40 miles outside the city.

18:51.137 --> 18:53.037
What about the girl?

18:53.070 --> 18:54.437
Yeah.

18:54.947 --> 18:56.947
??

19:00.977 --> 19:03.511
<i>( shower water running )
We're still waiting
to hear from forensics.</i>

19:03.544 --> 19:05.743
They think that
he offered her a ride,

19:05.777 --> 19:08.444
<i>( water stops )
raped her and
then strangled her.</i>

19:09.544 --> 19:10.743
Is it just me

19:10.777 --> 19:13.044
or does this kind of thing
seem to be going around?

19:13.077 --> 19:16.377
I know, I thought
the same thing.

19:17.411 --> 19:18.678
What?

19:18.710 --> 19:22.144
Maybe it's broken.

19:22.177 --> 19:24.810
I'm sorry, you lost me.

19:24.843 --> 19:27.077
<i>( sighs ):
I don't know.</i>

19:27.110 --> 19:29.910
When these girls
popped into my dreams,

19:29.944 --> 19:33.678
it was like I was receiving
distress signals or somethg.

19:33.710 --> 19:35.910
I saw them alone,
ey were in need of help.

19:35.944 --> 19:37.944
They were not
in danger of being killed.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.578
Wait, you still saw them.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.211
You just...

19:41.244 --> 19:43.110
you didn't get
the whole story.

19:43.144 --> 19:44.743
That's the thing--
I felt like I did.

19:44.777 --> 19:47.644
I felt like from the moment
they came into my dreams,

19:47.678 --> 19:50.544
these girls, their lives
were not in danger.

19:50.578 --> 19:52.277
They were just stuck,

19:52.311 --> 19:55.010
they were stuck on the side of
the road needing gas,

19:55.044 --> 19:57.678
stuck on an out-of-the-way trail
with a broken ankle.

19:57.710 --> 19:59.578
So?
So...

19:59.611 --> 20:01.544
how did he know?
How did he find them?

20:01.578 --> 20:03.244
I don't know.

20:03.277 --> 20:04.411
Luck?

20:06.110 --> 20:09.010
Maybe-Maybe we're jumping
the gun here, Allison.

20:09.044 --> 20:11.477
I mean, we can't even be sure
that both of these attacks

20:11.511 --> 20:13.277
were committed by
the same person.

20:13.311 --> 20:14.377
I mean, think about it,

20:14.411 --> 20:16.544
some homicidal maniac
gets this lucky twice.

20:16.578 --> 20:17.578
No, I know.

20:17.611 --> 20:20.777
You're right, it makes no sense.

20:20.810 --> 20:23.044
It doesn't make it
any less tragic, but...

20:25.077 --> 20:26.843
Looks like it's
going to rain.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.877
What do you want to do
with the girls?

20:34.644 --> 20:36.678
BRIDGETTE:
Mom, I'm ready.

20:36.710 --> 20:37.777
Coming.

20:37.810 --> 20:39.110
I'm coming.

20:41.477 --> 20:43.177
You're late,
Ms. Dubois.

20:43.211 --> 20:44.810
We're gonna have
to mark you tardy.

20:44.843 --> 20:47.177
I'll have my mommy
write me a note on Monday.

20:51.044 --> 20:53.277
Fire when ready.

20:55.044 --> 20:57.843
"My mom's an investigator
for the District Attorney.

20:57.877 --> 21:00.710
"The District Attorney is a
lawyer who works for the people.

21:00.743 --> 21:03.444
"When someone is arrested for
murdering somebody,

21:03.477 --> 21:06.644
"the District Attorney is
supposed to prove they did it.

21:06.678 --> 21:09.578
"This is lucky because it seems
like everywhere my mom goes

21:09.611 --> 21:12.311
"she's always finding
dead bodies.

21:12.344 --> 21:16.477
"A lot of times my mom's
instincts tell her where to be

21:16.511 --> 21:18.110
"to find dead bodies.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.944
"Just the other day, my mom
said, 'Let's go for a hike.'

21:20.977 --> 21:22.710
We never go on hikes, but..."

21:24.144 --> 21:26.544
<i>( groans ):
Oh, boy.</i>

21:26.578 --> 21:29.177
<i>( ringing )
Yep, I'm going
to go get that.</i>

21:31.177 --> 21:32.377
JOE:
Hello.

21:32.411 --> 21:33.411
Bridge...

21:33.444 --> 21:34.444
Good morning, sir.

21:34.477 --> 21:35.910
Mommy doesn't see
dead bodies

21:35.944 --> 21:37.110
wherever she goes.

21:37.144 --> 21:38.644
Sure you do.
Don't you remember?

21:38.678 --> 21:39.810
That's what
you told me.

21:39.843 --> 21:42.044
No, honey,
I never told you that.

21:42.077 --> 21:43.344
Yes, you did.

21:43.377 --> 21:44.977
You said you listened
to your instincts,

21:45.010 --> 21:46.444
they tell you
where to go,

21:46.477 --> 21:48.544
and that's where
the dead bodies are.

21:48.578 --> 21:50.311
Al?

21:50.344 --> 21:51.644
It's your boss.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.211
Hold on.

21:58.611 --> 21:59.910
Hello.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.777
Sorry to bother you
on a wet Sunday,

22:01.810 --> 22:03.777
but apparently the press
is starting

22:03.810 --> 22:05.177
to grab ahold of this thing,

22:05.211 --> 22:07.678
and the deputy mayor was
wondering if we could come in

22:07.710 --> 22:11.244
and give her a quick briefing
on everything we know.

22:15.211 --> 22:16.877
When do you need me?

22:22.211 --> 22:23.843
They gave him a name?

22:23.877 --> 22:25.710
Oh, yeah.

22:25.743 --> 22:28.311
Why do they think it's one guy?

22:28.344 --> 22:31.077
Honestly, I don't think
there's a lot of actual thinking

22:31.110 --> 22:33.110
going on here.
Although, there is some
reason to suspect

22:33.144 --> 22:34.910
that we may be talking about
a single individual

22:34.944 --> 22:36.710
What makes you say that?

22:38.511 --> 22:41.244
It's not the greatest link
in the world,

22:41.277 --> 22:42.544
but when we found that girl

22:42.578 --> 22:44.910
on the side of the Sonoran
Desert Highway,

22:44.944 --> 22:47.177
there was a large recent
oil spot

22:47.211 --> 22:48.877
almost directly behind her car.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.977
We checked her undercarriage
and it's tight as a drum.

22:51.010 --> 22:52.311
So we went back

22:52.344 --> 22:54.110
to Mariposa State Park
and wouldn't you know it?

22:54.144 --> 22:56.044
We found another
large oil spot

22:56.077 --> 22:58.578
in one of the parking spaces
located in the lot closest

22:58.611 --> 23:00.578
to where that sorority girl
was found.

23:00.611 --> 23:02.211
And that proves?

23:02.244 --> 23:03.211
Nothing.

23:03.244 --> 23:05.244
Lee, you know as well as I do

23:05.277 --> 23:08.077
that you can't even be sure
that oil came from the same car.

23:08.110 --> 23:10.444
As a clue, it's worthless.

23:10.477 --> 23:11.710
It's not like you can trace

23:11.743 --> 23:12.910
the oil back
to its owner.

23:12.944 --> 23:14.710
Hey, I'm not telling you
it's not a straw.

23:14.743 --> 23:16.110
And I'll be the first
to admit

23:16.144 --> 23:17.511
that we are grasping here.

23:17.544 --> 23:18.644
This is ridiculous.

23:18.678 --> 23:19.910
Has anyone looked
at a map?

23:19.944 --> 23:22.311
Did you see how
far apart these two
incidents occurred?

23:22.344 --> 23:23.477
About 60 miles.

23:23.511 --> 23:24.910
60 miles.

23:24.944 --> 23:26.977
In my opinion, Ms. Deputy Mayor,

23:27.010 --> 23:28.644
the only responsible thing
to do

23:28.678 --> 23:30.311
is to call a press conference
and reassure

23:30.344 --> 23:31.944
the city
that in all likelihood,

23:31.977 --> 23:34.077
these were two
tragic, separate

23:34.110 --> 23:35.810
and random acts
of violence

23:35.843 --> 23:38.810
committed by two
completely different
individuals...

23:38.843 --> 23:41.377
that the police department
is doing everything it can

23:41.411 --> 23:42.777
to find the guilty parties,

23:42.810 --> 23:45.511
but that we are not
looking at a murder spree

23:45.544 --> 23:47.843
being perpetrated
by some psychotic

23:47.877 --> 23:49.511
Bad Samaritan.

23:50.544 --> 23:52.110
<i>Hey, this is Cindy.
Leave a message.</i>

23:52.144 --> 23:55.810
Cin, hey. It's Taylor.
What's up?

23:55.843 --> 23:58.743
So, you know how my parents
went away this weekend

23:58.777 --> 24:01.843
and I was totally psyched
'cause they finally let me

24:01.877 --> 24:03.044
stay home alone this time?

24:03.077 --> 24:07.511
Um, well, maybe it's not
as cool as I thought.

24:07.544 --> 24:12.411
'Cause honestly, it's kind of
creepy being here all alone.

24:12.444 --> 24:14.743
And I guess 'cause I watched
this horror movie on cable

24:14.777 --> 24:17.710
that was hella scary

24:17.743 --> 24:22.177
and now there's all this
lightning and thunder and...

24:22.211 --> 24:24.743
This is going to sound
kind of lame,

24:24.777 --> 24:26.477
and don't even repeat this
to anyone

24:26.511 --> 24:28.211
'cause if you do,
I'll, like, totally deny it,

24:28.244 --> 24:33.010
but maybe you could come
crash here tonight?

24:33.044 --> 24:34.777
I know it's so weak,

24:34.810 --> 24:37.144
but I just don't want
to be here solo.

24:37.177 --> 24:41.944
Um, so anyway,
it's 11:35 right now.

24:41.977 --> 24:43.810
Um, you can call me at home,
not my cell.

24:43.843 --> 24:45.644
It's 555-0178.

24:47.743 --> 24:50.710
555-0178.

24:50.743 --> 24:53.411
555-0178.

24:53.444 --> 24:57.244
555-0178...

24:58.544 --> 25:00.777
Come on, come on,
come on, pick up.

25:00.810 --> 25:02.678
TAYLOR:
Hello.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.511
Taylor, hi. You don't know me.
My name is Allison Dubois.

25:05.544 --> 25:07.910
I work with the District
Attorney's office in Phoenix.

25:07.944 --> 25:11.377
Don't ask me how, but I know
that you are home all alone.

25:11.411 --> 25:13.277
Now I need you to listen.

25:13.311 --> 25:15.010
Who is this?

25:15.044 --> 25:16.077
My name is Allison Dubois.

25:16.110 --> 25:17.910
Did Cindy tell you to call?

25:17.944 --> 25:19.277
No, Cindy didn't tell me
to call.

25:19.311 --> 25:20.777
I told you my name
is Allison Dubois.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.511
I think you might be
in a lot of danger.

25:22.544 --> 25:25.843
I need you to give me
your address.

25:25.877 --> 25:27.810
And I need you to go around
and make sure

25:27.843 --> 25:30.110
all your doors and windows
are locked.

25:30.144 --> 25:31.244
Hello?

25:31.277 --> 25:33.344
This isn't funny.

25:33.377 --> 25:35.411
I'm not trying to be funny!

25:35.444 --> 25:38.377
I need your address. I need to
know that you are going around

25:38.411 --> 25:40.211
and locking all your doors
and windows

25:40.244 --> 25:42.710
so I can hang up with you
and I can call the police

25:42.743 --> 25:44.843
and get them out there.
Hello? Hello?

25:49.344 --> 25:50.743
WOMAN:
Phoenix Metro Police.

25:50.777 --> 25:52.411
What's the nature
of your emergency?

25:52.444 --> 25:53.578
My name is Allison Dubois.

25:53.611 --> 25:55.710
I work with the Phoenix
District Attorney's office.

25:55.743 --> 25:58.377
I need the address
of a house whose phone number

25:58.411 --> 26:00.944
is 555-0178.

26:06.511 --> 26:08.743
Listen, butt brain,
do not call here.

26:08.777 --> 26:10.477
MAN:
Taylor Greene?

26:10.511 --> 26:12.244
Yeah. Who's this?

26:12.277 --> 26:14.344
This is 911 dispatch.

26:14.377 --> 26:17.444
We have a car coming your way.

26:17.477 --> 26:19.110
A car? Why?

26:19.144 --> 26:20.843
We received a call
coming from someone

26:20.877 --> 26:22.311
in the District Attorney's
office

26:22.344 --> 26:24.944
saying an intruder was trying
to break into your house.

26:26.977 --> 26:27.977
Hello?

26:28.010 --> 26:29.477
Hold on. Don't hang up.

26:29.511 --> 26:30.944
I want to check some stuff.

26:32.377 --> 26:34.843
Who was this who called you?

26:34.877 --> 26:35.877
I don't know, ma'am.

26:35.910 --> 26:37.010
Should I cancel the car

26:37.044 --> 26:38.944
or would you like me to stay
on the line with you?

26:38.977 --> 26:41.244
Stay on the line.
Stay on the line.

26:41.277 --> 26:43.244
No problem. I'm right here.

26:43.277 --> 26:44.843
Are you okay, ma'am?

26:44.877 --> 26:47.444
I'm here. Just don't hang up.
Keep talking.

27:02.171 --> 27:03.604
Hey, early bird.

27:03.638 --> 27:08.137
What you doing,
worm-catching?

27:08.171 --> 27:09.970
He struck again.

27:10.004 --> 27:12.737
16-year-old girl
home alone.

27:12.770 --> 27:14.437
I called her
right before he got there,

27:14.471 --> 27:15.703
then I called
the police.

27:15.737 --> 27:18.538
Apparently, he was just
about to break in,

27:18.571 --> 27:21.104
but she surprised him
and he fled.

27:21.137 --> 27:24.371
There was an oil slick
outside her house at the curb.

27:24.404 --> 27:26.171
It's definitely
the same guy.

27:30.237 --> 27:33.538
But that makes no sense.

27:33.571 --> 27:35.204
I still don't get it.

27:35.237 --> 27:37.104
How does he find them?

27:37.137 --> 27:39.171
It can't be luck.

27:39.204 --> 27:41.904
Three vulnerable,
isolated girls,

27:41.937 --> 27:44.538
totally different
parts of the city

27:44.571 --> 27:46.271
three times in a row.

27:46.304 --> 27:47.404
How could he have known

27:47.437 --> 27:49.471
that this last girl
was alone?

27:49.504 --> 27:51.304
Nobody could have known
that but you.

27:51.337 --> 27:54.337
Or somebody like me.

27:54.371 --> 27:56.737
Yesterday, the Mayor's office
assured us

27:56.770 --> 27:57.970
that the killing spree was over,

27:58.004 --> 28:00.703
that the two weekend murders
had no connection.

28:00.737 --> 28:02.970
Today, a third apparent attack,

28:03.004 --> 28:06.204
and now a bizarre new twist
in the serial murder spree

28:06.237 --> 28:08.670
that has all of Phoenix
in a state of panic.

28:08.703 --> 28:11.271
I was just lying in bed
and this lady called

28:11.304 --> 28:13.304
and warned me
to lock the doors

28:13.337 --> 28:14.703
'cause someone was coming.

28:14.737 --> 28:16.604
Just like that,
out of the blue?

28:16.638 --> 28:19.371
You know who
she was?

28:19.404 --> 28:20.970
Well, why did you
believe her?

28:21.004 --> 28:22.703
Um, I didn't at first,

28:22.737 --> 28:25.004
but then she said she worked

28:25.037 --> 28:26.171
for the District Attorney's
office

28:26.204 --> 28:27.870
and it sounded kinda serious.

28:27.904 --> 28:30.904
And then she said she was going
to send the police.

28:30.937 --> 28:32.904
And a minute later
the police were calling.

28:32.937 --> 28:34.538
And did you get this
woman's name?

28:34.571 --> 28:39.337
Um, I only got her first name--
Andrea or Allison.

28:39.371 --> 28:40.404
Something like that.

28:40.437 --> 28:42.104
Who was this mystery caller?

28:42.137 --> 28:44.837
Your Action News Team
has made repeated phone calls

28:44.870 --> 28:48.037
to the District Attorney's
office and gotten no response.

28:48.070 --> 28:49.371
And whoever she was,

28:49.404 --> 28:51.604
how was she able to warn
the young victim

28:51.638 --> 28:54.104
before the serial killer struck?
Could it be that

28:54.137 --> 28:56.538
the District Attorney, the
Mayor's office and the Police

28:56.571 --> 28:59.437
Department know more than
they're letting on? Stay tune...

28:59.471 --> 29:02.271
Every channel's running a
version of the same thing.

29:02.304 --> 29:03.604
The papers are full of it, too.

29:03.638 --> 29:05.670
I just got off
the phone with the Mayor.

29:05.703 --> 29:07.737
Everyone wants
an explanation.

29:07.770 --> 29:10.204
I think we have
to give them one.

29:10.237 --> 29:12.571
Hello. Thank you for coming.
My name is Allison Dubois

29:12.604 --> 29:14.304
and I work
as a freelance consultant

29:14.337 --> 29:16.604
and investigator for
the District Attorney's office.

29:19.137 --> 29:22.304
There's been much
recent speculation about who

29:22.337 --> 29:25.070
in the District Attorney's
office called Taylor Greene

29:25.104 --> 29:29.670
to warn her that someone was
trying to break into her house,

29:29.703 --> 29:33.271
and how this caller obtained
this information.

29:36.404 --> 29:41.937
You might be surprised
by my answer-- luck.

29:41.970 --> 29:43.937
I'd been working late on,
of all things,

29:43.970 --> 29:45.437
the Bad Samaritan case

29:45.471 --> 29:47.371
and I was driving home from work

29:47.404 --> 29:49.171
when I passed
Ms. Greene's house.

29:49.204 --> 29:54.604
I saw a figure lurking
about the perimeter of the house

29:54.638 --> 29:57.471
and it looked like a burglar,
so I called 911.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.904
They promised to send
a police car.

29:59.937 --> 30:00.970
Concerned about the safety

30:01.004 --> 30:02.538
of whoever might have been
in the house,

30:02.571 --> 30:06.104
I requested a reverse phone
number lookup

30:06.137 --> 30:08.237
from Ms. Greene's street address

30:08.271 --> 30:10.638
and was immediately connected
to her home phone.

30:10.670 --> 30:14.070
Like I said-- luck.

30:14.104 --> 30:16.404
But let me take this moment

30:16.437 --> 30:18.471
to clear up
another misconception.

30:18.504 --> 30:20.204
We cannot be certain
at this time

30:20.237 --> 30:22.937
that the man who fled
Ms. Greene's house

30:22.970 --> 30:27.870
is the same person responsible
for this weekend's two murders.

30:27.904 --> 30:30.571
Naturally, we're using
Ms. Greene's description

30:30.604 --> 30:32.870
of the suspect and working
in conjunction

30:32.904 --> 30:34.803
with the Phoenix police
to help apprehend him.

30:34.837 --> 30:36.137
Thank you.

30:36.171 --> 30:38.538
Mom, you lied.

30:38.571 --> 30:40.404
I didn't lie.

30:40.437 --> 30:42.371
We don't know that those three
incidents

30:42.404 --> 30:44.404
were the work of one man.

30:44.437 --> 30:45.437
Everybody has an opinion.

30:45.471 --> 30:46.538
I have an opinion,

30:46.571 --> 30:49.037
but since the Mayor went ahead
and told everybody

30:49.070 --> 30:50.237
that he didn't think
there was a connection...

30:50.271 --> 30:51.371
That's not what she meant.

30:53.371 --> 30:54.837
You weren't working last night.

30:54.870 --> 30:56.703
You didn't drive
by that girl's house.

30:56.737 --> 30:59.204
Why did you say that you did?

30:59.237 --> 31:00.970
How did you know
that that man would break in?

31:01.004 --> 31:03.070
Girls, Mommy works
for someone.

31:03.104 --> 31:04.504
When you work
for someone...

31:04.538 --> 31:06.471
Joe.

31:14.337 --> 31:15.703
Ariel's right.

31:15.737 --> 31:19.638
I lied, and that
is really not something

31:19.670 --> 31:21.770
that I want
to teach you girls.

31:21.803 --> 31:27.638
And to answer your question,
I don't know.

31:27.670 --> 31:30.970
I don't know how
I knew that man

31:31.004 --> 31:34.070
was going to be
outside that girl's house.

31:34.104 --> 31:37.070
I just did.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.371
That happens to me
sometimes.

31:39.404 --> 31:41.437
I see something.

31:41.471 --> 31:43.837
I just know things.

31:43.870 --> 31:47.437
I just sense things.

31:47.471 --> 31:50.037
I don't get to pick
and choose what they are.

31:50.070 --> 31:57.304
And I have learned
most people don't
understand it.

31:57.337 --> 32:00.137
So it's not something
that I talk about.

32:00.171 --> 32:02.604
It's not something
that I try to explain.

32:05.471 --> 32:09.404
Do you girls understand
what Mommy's saying to you?

32:09.437 --> 32:12.271
I know you girls know
what I'm talking about.

32:14.437 --> 32:16.638
I think a little bit
of what I have

32:16.670 --> 32:18.770
has rubbed off on you.

32:18.803 --> 32:21.070
I know that you've
felt this thing.

32:21.104 --> 32:23.803
But you have to trust
me when I tell you

32:23.837 --> 32:27.371
very few people
ever experience it.

32:27.404 --> 32:31.137
And very few people
understand it.

32:31.171 --> 32:34.137
Which is why,
for the moment at least,

32:34.171 --> 32:37.904
only you and Daddy

32:37.937 --> 32:41.304
and a couple of
people at work know.

32:41.337 --> 32:45.070
And I'm asking you,
just for the time being,

32:45.104 --> 32:49.104
don't tell your friends.

32:49.137 --> 32:51.304
Don't talk about it
at school.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.604
Don't share
it with anyone.

32:52.638 --> 32:56.638
Is that
an order?

32:56.670 --> 33:01.237
No, honey. No.

33:01.271 --> 33:02.571
It's just a suggestion.

33:02.604 --> 33:04.970
It's just a hope.

33:05.004 --> 33:06.737
No parent has the final word

33:06.770 --> 33:08.571
on what their children say
about them.

33:08.604 --> 33:11.471
It's just...

33:11.504 --> 33:16.604
People just don't understand it.

33:16.638 --> 33:19.703
And I really don't want them
treating you differently

33:19.737 --> 33:21.803
because of the way I am.

33:28.337 --> 33:31.004
Now, come on, give me a kiss.
Let's get ready for bed.

33:37.970 --> 33:40.271
<i>( sighs )</i>

33:42.204 --> 33:43.937
What do you think?

33:43.970 --> 33:45.604
About what?

33:45.638 --> 33:48.770
Tomorrow is
Bridgette's report.

33:48.803 --> 33:51.404
If she's going
to say something,
tomorrow's the day.

33:51.437 --> 33:54.171
I don't know.
What do you think?

33:54.204 --> 33:56.538
I thought you
were amazing.

33:56.571 --> 34:01.070
I thought you said everything
just about perfectly.

34:01.104 --> 34:05.004
I guess the rest
is up to her.

34:05.037 --> 34:07.538
And I think I'm all
right with that.

34:07.571 --> 34:11.504
I wish I didn't lie.

34:11.538 --> 34:14.770
Well, you didn't lie.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.703
You told a fib.

34:16.737 --> 34:18.937
And you didn't fib
to the girls.

34:18.969 --> 34:21.103
You told them the truth.

34:21.137 --> 34:23.969
And I think that
is what they're
going to remember.

34:24.004 --> 34:26.404
I hope you're right.

34:30.803 --> 34:32.471
What's so funny?

34:32.504 --> 34:36.204
Today. This day.

34:36.237 --> 34:38.670
For all of my "gifts,"

34:38.703 --> 34:41.004
I didn't see
this one coming.

34:41.036 --> 34:43.070
Helping that girl
last night.

34:43.103 --> 34:45.904
Devalos calling
a press conference.

34:45.937 --> 34:48.969
The conversation
with the girls.

34:49.004 --> 34:51.603
This life thing
is a tricky business.

34:51.638 --> 34:53.204
Keep looking for
a batting order,

34:53.237 --> 34:55.204
a table of contents...

34:55.237 --> 34:57.870
something to let you know
what's happening next.

34:57.904 --> 35:00.337
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

35:03.737 --> 35:05.070
Hello.

35:05.104 --> 35:07.937
MAN:
Is this Allison Dubois?

35:07.970 --> 35:09.638
Uh, may I ask who's calling?

35:09.670 --> 35:11.703
You don't know me.

35:11.737 --> 35:14.538
I just saw you on the news,
and I wanted to call

35:14.571 --> 35:16.437
and tell you
how impressed I was.

35:16.471 --> 35:18.337
Who is that?

35:18.371 --> 35:21.271
I'm sorry...
didn't catch your name.

35:21.304 --> 35:23.803
That's because I didn't
tell you my name.

35:23.837 --> 35:26.237
That was quite a story.

35:26.271 --> 35:29.437
The one about passing
the house and seeing me.

35:29.471 --> 35:31.004
It's him.

35:33.571 --> 35:35.803
Really, who is this?

35:35.837 --> 35:37.437
You tell me.

35:37.471 --> 35:39.471
You're the dreamer.

35:39.504 --> 35:42.137
You're the one
who sees things.

35:42.171 --> 35:44.538
It was funny and strange
watching TV

35:44.571 --> 35:46.437
and seeing someone else
who had it.

35:46.471 --> 35:48.837
Spent my whole life looking.

35:48.870 --> 35:50.770
Never found anyone.

35:50.803 --> 35:53.604
And then there you were
on the television.

35:53.638 --> 35:56.070
Someone else who can do it.

35:56.104 --> 35:58.171
Someone else
who gets the dreams.

35:58.204 --> 36:00.337
You know, when I get off
this phone,

36:00.371 --> 36:02.371
I'm going to have them trace
this call.

36:02.404 --> 36:04.437
Oh, I'm counting on it.

36:04.471 --> 36:07.004
And you know, as soon
as I get off this call

36:07.037 --> 36:09.204
I'm going to throw away
this cell phone.

36:09.237 --> 36:11.803
Well, I mean, you know...

36:11.837 --> 36:14.870
after I pull away from
the front of your house.

36:16.737 --> 36:18.670
Al, what's going on?

36:25.737 --> 36:27.070
Oil.

36:27.104 --> 36:30.171
Oh, my God,
he knows where we live.

36:33.977 --> 36:36.010
I can't trace the oil
back to its owner.

36:37.944 --> 36:40.211
I will trace
and find that
cell phone.

36:40.244 --> 36:42.077
If he bought it
on credit

36:42.110 --> 36:44.810
or left a fingerprint on it,
we'll find that, too.

36:44.843 --> 36:46.344
But short of that...

36:46.377 --> 36:49.010
Well, what about
tonight, what
about tomorrow?

36:49.044 --> 36:51.777
I'm concerned
about my family.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.944
I'm going to leave
a couple uniforms

36:54.977 --> 36:57.578
and a cruiser outside
to stand watch.

36:57.611 --> 36:59.644
If you're out
and about

36:59.678 --> 37:00.910
and somebody
looks at you funny,

37:00.944 --> 37:03.044
somebody makes
you feel nervous, call me.

37:03.077 --> 37:04.110
I'll have an
officer there

37:04.144 --> 37:06.644
before we're off the phone.

37:06.678 --> 37:09.877
My guess is, he's on his way
to California by now,

37:09.910 --> 37:11.477
or New Mexico.

37:11.511 --> 37:13.177
We've alerted the authorities
in those states.

37:13.211 --> 37:14.843
We've set up roadblocks.

37:14.877 --> 37:17.578
But nobody quite knows
who we're looking for,

37:17.611 --> 37:20.477
so it's hard to say
how effective they'll be.

37:22.678 --> 37:24.977
You holding up okay?

37:26.977 --> 37:30.611
It was scary that
he was so close.

37:30.644 --> 37:35.544
I'm just amazed that
my kids have slept through this.

37:35.578 --> 37:40.511
He sees them
in his dreams, huh?

37:40.544 --> 37:43.511
It's too bad we couldn't get the
bastard to work for our side.

37:46.511 --> 37:48.843
Give me
five more minutes.

37:48.877 --> 37:50.377
I'll have my guys
out of here

37:50.411 --> 37:52.144
and you two can
go back to bed.

37:58.411 --> 37:59.843
BRIDGETTE:
Psst.

38:02.477 --> 38:03.910
Psst.

38:06.710 --> 38:09.511
The whole house
is full of police.

38:09.544 --> 38:12.910
What are you talking about?

38:12.944 --> 38:16.110
I think I liked it all better
when Mommy wasn't special.

38:16.144 --> 38:19.777
I think I liked it all better
when Mommy was just Mommy.

38:19.810 --> 38:23.843
Mommy is just Mommy.

38:26.144 --> 38:28.611
Want to hop in here?

39:07.077 --> 39:09.311
<i>ALLISON:
I believe that when people
are alone</i>

39:09.344 --> 39:13.578
<i>and vulnerableand afraid,
they put out</i>

39:13.611 --> 39:16.678
<i>a sort of distress signal,</i>

39:16.710 --> 39:19.544
<i>an alarm of sorts.</i>

39:19.578 --> 39:21.877
<i>An S.O.S.</i>

39:21.910 --> 39:24.810
<i>It's not visible or audible.</i>

39:24.843 --> 39:27.211
<i>At least not to everyone.</i>

39:27.244 --> 39:30.211
<i>Just certain people.</i>

39:43.377 --> 39:45.377
What's going on?
You all right?

39:45.411 --> 39:46.743
I'm good.

39:46.777 --> 39:48.144
I'm great.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.344
Everything's going
to be just fine.

39:50.377 --> 39:51.377
SCANLON:
Yeah?

39:51.411 --> 39:53.311
Lee, it's Allison.

39:53.344 --> 39:54.777
I know where he is.

39:56.010 --> 39:58.611
WOMAN:
And now we get to hear
from someone

39:58.644 --> 40:00.944
I know I'm looking
forward to.

40:00.977 --> 40:03.044
Her mommy has been
in the newspaper

40:03.077 --> 40:06.977
and on TV, and this morning
I heard

40:07.010 --> 40:09.611
she was involved in catching
a really dangerous criminal

40:09.644 --> 40:11.710
as he fled the state last night.

40:11.743 --> 40:15.444
So let's hear from
Bridgette Dubois.

40:33.311 --> 40:35.743
"My mom is an investigator
for the dis...

40:35.777 --> 40:37.644
"for the District Attorney.

40:37.678 --> 40:39.277
"The District Attorney is
a lawyer

40:39.311 --> 40:40.678
"who works for the people

40:40.710 --> 40:43.110
"when someone is arrested
for doing something bad.

40:43.144 --> 40:45.411
"The District Attorney is
supposed to prove they did it.

40:45.444 --> 40:46.877
"My mom helps with this.

40:46.910 --> 40:48.244
"You ask her how
she helps,

40:48.277 --> 40:50.944
"she'll tell you she doesn't
really know.

40:50.977 --> 40:52.843
"I just know that
when she's done,

40:52.877 --> 40:54.710
"she comes home and gets
to be with me

40:54.743 --> 40:57.678
"and my sisters and my dad.

40:57.710 --> 40:59.511
"She's a really good
investigator,

40:59.544 --> 41:01.477
"but she's a really great mom.

41:01.511 --> 41:03.044
"And I keep thinking,

41:03.077 --> 41:05.477
"if people would just stop
doing bad things,

41:05.511 --> 41:09.010
maybe she could stay home
and be a mom all the time."

41:24.644 --> 41:26.977
Morning, Mom.
Did you sleep good?

41:27.010 --> 41:29.044
Actually, I did.
How about you?

41:29.077 --> 41:30.377
Yeah. Really good.

41:30.411 --> 41:32.044
I even had
a good dream.

41:32.077 --> 41:33.544
A good dream? Really?

41:33.578 --> 41:35.944
Uh-huh. It helped me figure
out something

41:35.977 --> 41:37.910
that was
bothering me.

41:37.944 --> 41:40.311
I had one of those, too.
What was yours about?
