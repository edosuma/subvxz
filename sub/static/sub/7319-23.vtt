WEBVTT

00:20.933 --> 00:23.100
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT IT.

00:23.133 --> 00:24.833
WHAT I WOULD DO,
YOU KNOW?

00:24.867 --> 00:29.200
WHAT THE DREAM WOULD BE
IF I COULDN'T HAVE MY DREAM.

00:29.233 --> 00:30.400
EMPTY OFFICE.

00:30.433 --> 00:33.300
OKAY, WHAT ARE WE DOING? I
THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO LUNCH.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.300
WHY ARE WE
STILL SITTING HERE?

00:34.333 --> 00:36.300
WE'RE DOING WHAT I DO
WHEN I GET DEPRESSED.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.300
JUST WAIT.
WHAT TIME DO YOU HAVE?

00:38.333 --> 00:40.233
IT'S 5 TO 1:00.

00:40.267 --> 00:42.567
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GLAD
I CAN'T HAVE A CHILD.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.433
WITH MY LUCK, I'D PROBABLY
HAVE A KID WITH TWO HEADS.

00:45.467 --> 00:47.367
IT--IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER.
I'M GRATEFUL.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.267
I DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.
THE OPTION IS...

00:50.300 --> 00:52.467
(makes whooshing sound)
OFF THE TABLE.
WHAT TIME DO YOU HAVE?

00:52.500 --> 00:54.533
5 TO 1:00.

00:54.567 --> 00:57.100
YOU PEOPLE ARE OBSESSED
WITH TIME.

00:59.067 --> 01:00.767
HERE HE COMES.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.700
***

01:10.133 --> 01:12.533
HI, DELL.

01:12.567 --> 01:15.600
***

01:31.167 --> 01:35.067
***

01:47.333 --> 01:52.067
***

01:52.067 --> 01:54.067
HAVE A NICE... SURF.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.400
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
AFTER LUNCH?

01:56.433 --> 01:59.333
***

02:02.333 --> 02:03.600
(laughs)

02:03.633 --> 02:06.300
OH, MY GOD.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.700
YOU TWO SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

02:08.733 --> 02:10.767
(Naomi) ADMIT IT.
YOU FEEL BETTER.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.533
AND IF NOT, THERE'S
ANOTHER SHOWING IN AN HOUR,

02:14.567 --> 02:17.500
AND IT'S WET.

02:17.533 --> 02:20.633
MY BRAIN IS BLEEDING?
HOW COULD MY BRAIN

02:20.667 --> 02:22.567
HAVE BEEN BLEEDING
SINCE THE ACCIDENT?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.500
WELL, IT COULD BE
FROM THE TRAUMA,

02:24.533 --> 02:26.600
BUT IT ALSO COULD BE
FROM ONE OF YOUR SURGERIES.
DR. SHEPHERD,

02:26.633 --> 02:29.167
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN THIS
HOSPITAL LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW

02:29.200 --> 02:31.367
WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING
ONE OF YOU ISN'T SAYING.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.300
BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION
OF THE BLEED,

02:33.333 --> 02:35.567
YOU NEED TO BE AWAKE
DURING SURGERY.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.667
YOU'LL BE SEDATED, ALERT,

02:36.700 --> 02:38.733
BUT IT CAN BE
A REALLY DANGEROUS PROCESS.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.367
THERE'S A LOT ABOUT THE BRAIN
WE DON'T KNOW.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.067
SO... I COULD POTENTIALLY
GET MY MEMORY BACK?

02:44.067 --> 02:45.567
MM. IT'S POSSIBLE.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.067
AMNESIA CAN BE A SYMPTOM,
BUT I THINK IT'S A LONG SHOT.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.067
I'LL DO SOME BRAIN MAPPING
AND SEE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,

02:50.067 --> 02:52.533
BUT--
BUT I COULD...
GET MY MEMORY BACK?

02:52.567 --> 02:54.467
YOU'RE BACK? WHAT HAPPENED?

02:54.500 --> 02:56.600
SHE'S GOT A FEVER,

02:56.633 --> 02:59.233
AND I THINK I HEAR
A SMALL MURMUR.
A HEART MURMUR?

02:59.267 --> 03:00.767
DON'T BE DRAMATIC.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.767
AT LEAST
IT'S NOT THE HICCUPS.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.633
COULD BE COMPLICATIONS
FROM THE ENDOSCOPY.
BACTERIAL ENDOCARDITIS?

03:05.667 --> 03:08.500
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET TESTS,
AND IF THEY COME BACK POSITIVE,

03:08.533 --> 03:11.400
YOU'LL BE ADMITTED
FOR I.V. ANTIBIOTICS.
WHICH SHOULD KNOCK IT
RIGHT OUT.

03:11.433 --> 03:15.400
SEE? I TOLD YOU.
DON'T BE DRAMATIC.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.667
HEY, HEY. YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO WAIT FOR ME.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.133
I'M GOING CRAZY
JUST SITTING THERE.

03:24.167 --> 03:26.067
HEY, LOOK,
I'D BE FREAKED OUT, TOO,

03:26.067 --> 03:28.067
IF SOMEBODY WAS ABOUT TO
OPEN UP MY HEAD.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.833
BUT DR. SHEPHERD,
HE'S THE BEST.

03:29.867 --> 03:31.767
I CAN'T HOLD MY BABY,
RIGHT?

03:31.800 --> 03:33.667
SHE'S--
SHE'S IN THAT INCUBATOR.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.567
AND SO THE NURSES TOLD ME
TO TALK TO HER. AND I TRY.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.500
GUESS WHAT. RIGHT NOW,
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

03:39.533 --> 03:41.400
YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

03:41.433 --> 03:44.067
TO BE OUTSIDE,
TO HAVE THE WIND IN MY FACE

03:44.100 --> 03:45.500
OR RAIN OR...

03:45.533 --> 03:47.633
I KNOW THE SURGERY
IS DANGEROUS, BUT...

03:47.667 --> 03:49.400
I'M NOT FREAKED.

03:49.433 --> 03:51.333
I CAN'T WAIT.
WELL, THERE'S NO GUARANTEE

03:51.367 --> 03:54.267
THE SURGERY'S GONNA
BRING BACK YOUR MEMORY.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.367
BUT THERE'S A CHANCE.
IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.433
(Sam) GOOD NEWS.

03:59.467 --> 04:03.267
UH, PAUL'S LACK OF SEX DRIVE
COMES FROM A HORMONE IMBALANCE.

04:03.300 --> 04:04.700
SO PAUL STILL LIKES SEX?

04:04.733 --> 04:06.633
YEAH, WELL, HE'S A GUY
AND HE'S NOT DEAD,

04:06.667 --> 04:08.067
SO I'M GUESSING YEAH.

04:08.100 --> 04:11.133
HE JUST--HE JUST CAN'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS?

04:11.167 --> 04:13.467
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THERE
COULD BE MANY CAUSES

04:13.500 --> 04:15.767
TO THIS IMBALANCE,
SOME MORE SERIOUS THAN OTHERS.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.300
SO FINAL DIAGNOSIS
AND TREATMENT

04:17.333 --> 04:19.233
COULD BE A LENGTHY PROCESS.

04:19.267 --> 04:21.167
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RUN
MORE TESTS.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.100
SO IT MIGHT BE A WHILE

04:23.133 --> 04:25.300
BEFORE PAUL CAN HELP KATHY...
TAKE THE EDGE OFF.

04:25.333 --> 04:28.767
TELL HER TO TRY SWIMMING.
IT'S EASIER ON THE KNEES.
(chuckles)

04:30.367 --> 04:32.500
SO...

04:32.533 --> 04:34.133
YOU'RE THE QUACK.

04:34.167 --> 04:35.633
UH, I WENT TO MED SCHOOL.

04:35.667 --> 04:37.567
I'M ALSO A LICENSED HERBALIST,

04:37.600 --> 04:41.133
AND I SPENT FIVE YEARS IN CHINA
LEARNING ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE.

04:41.167 --> 04:43.567
LIKE I SAID... QUACK.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.100
COME HERE.

04:45.133 --> 04:47.067
UNLESS YOU NEED TO GO
TELL SOMEONE

04:47.067 --> 04:49.767
YOU SAW GOODY JOHNSON
WITH THE DEVIL.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.633
OKAY.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.633
LIE DOWN ON THE TABLE.

04:53.667 --> 04:54.733
WHY?

04:54.767 --> 04:57.400
I WANNA SHOW YOU
THAT I'M NOT A QUACK.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.233
I'M NOT TAKING
MY CLOTHES OFF.

05:02.267 --> 05:04.567
DID I ASK YOU
TO TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF?

05:04.600 --> 05:07.567
***

05:07.600 --> 05:10.233
(sighs)

05:16.733 --> 05:19.400
NOW...

05:19.433 --> 05:21.067
***

05:21.100 --> 05:24.300
YOU CARRY A LOT OF TENSION
IN YOUR SHOULDERS

05:24.333 --> 05:26.233
AND ABOVE YOUR RIGHT EYE.

05:26.267 --> 05:27.600
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:27.633 --> 05:29.533
YOU'RE BLOCKING
SOME SERIOUS EMOTION.

05:29.567 --> 05:31.067
HANG ON.

05:31.067 --> 05:33.767
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:33.800 --> 05:38.067
***

05:38.067 --> 05:41.067
OW!

05:41.067 --> 05:43.633
OW! OW!

05:43.667 --> 05:45.700
STOP SAYING "OW."
IT DOESN'T HURT.

05:47.467 --> 05:50.333
OKAY, I'M DONE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

05:50.367 --> 05:52.633
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME HERE
LIKE THIS.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.833
LIE THERE. DON'T MOVE.
BREATHE.

05:54.867 --> 05:57.100
YOU'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE
A RUSH OF EMOTION,

05:57.133 --> 05:59.233
A RELEASE OF...
PSYCHIC PAIN.

05:59.267 --> 06:03.067
***

06:07.400 --> 06:09.567
HELLO?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.633
HELLO?

06:11.667 --> 06:14.533
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING...

06:14.567 --> 06:16.067
EXCEPT STUPID FOR...

06:16.067 --> 06:20.100
LETTING A CUTE HIPPIE BOY
PUT NEEDLES IN MY FACE.

06:20.133 --> 06:21.400
HELLO!

06:21.433 --> 06:25.067
YEAH, PETE... I...

06:25.100 --> 06:26.433
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

06:26.467 --> 06:29.667
I DON'T HAVE ANY...
PSYCHIC PAIN.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.500
I... I'M GREAT.

06:32.533 --> 06:36.500
BARREN, BUT...
FAN-FREAKIN'-TASTIC.

06:36.533 --> 06:39.333
YOU CAN COME BACK NOW.

06:39.367 --> 06:42.233
I AM NOT FEELING ANY,
YOU KNOW, RUSH OF EMOTION

06:42.267 --> 06:43.433
OR ANYTHING.

06:43.467 --> 06:46.767
I DON'T FEEL... ANYTHING.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.700
***

06:51.733 --> 06:54.567
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING AT ALL.

06:58.533 --> 07:02.400
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING AT ALL.

07:02.433 --> 07:05.300
(sobs)

07:05.333 --> 07:07.233
***

07:07.267 --> 07:10.300
(voice breaks) I HATE L.A.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.433
HEY.
HEY.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.600
I HEARD SUSAN WAS BACK.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

07:22.633 --> 07:23.833
OH, AN INFECTION.
SHE'LL BE FINE.

07:23.867 --> 07:26.067
OH, GOOD, 'CAUSE I FIGURED
IF ANYTHING WAS WRONG,

07:26.067 --> 07:28.100
YOU'D TELL ME.
IF IT WAS SERIOUS, I WOULD,

07:28.133 --> 07:30.067
IN A VERY "LETTING YOU IN"
SORT OF WAY.

07:30.067 --> 07:31.800
YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD.
WHAT?

07:31.833 --> 07:34.167
MY FATHER--
WE'RE ALMOST TALKING.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.367
REALLY?

07:35.400 --> 07:37.067
HOW'S THE TRAILER?

07:37.067 --> 07:38.833
IT'S FREEZING.
(laughs)

07:38.867 --> 07:41.767
YOU WANT TO EAT LATER?
I'LL BRING SOMETHING OVER.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.067
ARE YOU USING ME
FOR CENTRAL HEATING?
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.567
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.167
LISA?

07:49.200 --> 07:51.100
(gasps) I THINK
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

07:51.133 --> 07:52.467
SHE'S IN PAIN.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.267
LISA?
ADDISON,
SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.233
OH, MY GOD.
I THINK I JUST WET MY PANTS.
NO, YOUR WATER BROKE.

07:58.267 --> 08:00.633
SHE'S IN LABOR,
AND IT'S COMING FAST.
I'LL CALL AN AMBULANCE.
UH, GO GET COOPER.

08:00.667 --> 08:02.567
AND LET THE HOSPITAL KNOW
WE'RE COMING AND CALL THE CHIEF.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.100
I DON'T WANT ANY PROBLEMS
WHEN I TRY TO SCRUB IN.

08:05.133 --> 08:06.067
BREATHE.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.600
(groans)
I NEED TO PUSH!

08:07.633 --> 08:08.800
DON'T PUSH.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.733
GET HER INTO LABOR
AND DELIVERY RIGHT AWAY.

08:10.767 --> 08:13.133
JIM, CHECK HER IN.

08:13.167 --> 08:15.633
LISA! IS SHE OKAY?
ARE THEY OKAY?

08:15.667 --> 08:17.567
WHAT HAPPENED?
IT'S TOO EARLY.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.500
SHE'S NOT DUE
FOR ANOTHER MONTH.
WELL, I'M GUESSING

08:19.533 --> 08:21.433
THAT THE STRESS OF YOU ALL
FIGHTING AND CROWDING HER,

08:21.467 --> 08:23.533
DECLARING YOURSELVES THE FATHER
DIDN'T HELP.

08:23.567 --> 08:24.767
MOVE!

08:24.800 --> 08:26.333
(Lisa groans)

08:32.300 --> 08:34.467
ANY WORD ON LISA
AND THE BABY?

08:34.500 --> 08:37.667
(sighs)
WE'RE STILL WAITING.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.067
THERAPY SUCKS.

08:39.067 --> 08:41.233
SAID THE SHRINK.

08:41.267 --> 08:43.167
NO, I MEAN MY PARTICULAR
BRAND OF THERAPY

08:43.200 --> 08:45.133
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE...
FULL OF CRAP.

08:45.167 --> 08:48.367
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT
THEIR PROBLEMS ENDLESSLY,

08:48.400 --> 08:49.767
TELLING PEOPLE
TO THINK POSITIVELY,

08:49.800 --> 08:52.200
VISUALIZE THEIR DESTINY.
IT DOESN'T WORK?

08:52.233 --> 08:55.267
I THINK POSITIVELY.
I VISUALIZE MY DESTINY.

08:55.300 --> 08:58.133
AND LOOK, JUST LOOK.

08:58.167 --> 09:00.067
WHAT AM I LOOKIN' AT?

09:00.067 --> 09:01.500
ME...

09:01.533 --> 09:04.433
MY PATHETIC,
MISERABLE EXISTENCE. (laughs)

09:04.467 --> 09:07.200
HE LEFT SIX MONTHS AGO.

09:07.233 --> 09:09.333
HE WAS A LOSER!

09:09.367 --> 09:12.200
DO YOU KNOW HE PEED A LITTLE BIT
EVERY TIME HE COUGHED?

09:12.233 --> 09:14.400
LIKE AN INCONTINENT OLD WOMAN.

09:14.433 --> 09:16.300
HE SMELLED LIKE PEE. (laughs)

09:16.333 --> 09:18.233
AND THERE I WAS,
IN THE CAR, CRYING,

09:18.267 --> 09:20.133
AND I'M A SERIOUS FEMINIST.

09:20.167 --> 09:22.400
NOT TO MENTION,
MY NO-SEX COUPLE?

09:22.433 --> 09:25.333
TURNS OUT IT WAS
A HORMONE THING. IT'S PHYSICAL.

09:25.367 --> 09:28.200
IN THE OLD DAYS WE WOULD'VE
TALKED AND TALKED AND TALKED

09:28.233 --> 09:30.133
AS PAUL GOT SICKER AND SICKER.

09:30.167 --> 09:32.067
MY PROFESSION'S
BECOMING IRRELEVANT.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.567
(chuckles)

09:33.600 --> 09:35.233
MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING.

09:35.267 --> 09:37.167
PEOPLE SHOULD JUST
TELL THE TRUTH

09:37.200 --> 09:39.367
TO THE PEOPLE
IN THEIR LIVES.
THEY CAN'T.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.667
IF THEY COULD,
WE'D ALL BE HEALTHY.
LIKE ME.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.067
YOU'RE NOT HEALTHY.
YOU'RE IN DENIAL.
I AM NOT IN DENIAL.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.100
YOU'RE IN DENIAL,
AND YOU'RE ANGRY.

09:46.133 --> 09:48.633
YOU'RE THE ANGRIEST MAN
I KNOW.
IS THAT WHY
YOU WON'T SLEEP WITH ME?

09:48.667 --> 09:50.567
YOU'RE IN DENIAL,
YOU'RE ANGRY,

09:50.600 --> 09:53.500
AND YOU USE SEX AS WEAPON
TO DEFLECT IT.

09:53.533 --> 09:55.800
OH.

09:55.833 --> 09:58.467
(Derek) NOW STIMULATING
AREA 11.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.400
AVA, CAN YOU NAME
THIS OBJECT?

10:00.433 --> 10:03.067
FLOWERS, PINK AND BLUE.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.500
AVOIDING AREA 11.
MOVING SUPERIORLY.

10:05.533 --> 10:07.400
THIS WILL BE AREA 12.

10:08.833 --> 10:13.167
UNA CARA CON LOS OJOS AZULES
Y EL PELO RUBIO.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.667
WAS THAT SPANISH?

10:14.700 --> 10:16.067
WAS IT?

10:16.100 --> 10:18.300
OKAY, I'M GOING ON TO 13.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.833
IL MAISON
AVEC des GALETS ROUGE.

10:20.867 --> 10:23.133
(chuckles) ALL RIGHT.
NOW YOU'RE JUST SHOWING OFF.

10:23.167 --> 10:26.533
EACH LANGUAGE IS STORED IN
A DIFFERENT AREA OF THE BRAIN.

10:26.567 --> 10:29.167
AND AS I STIMULATE THEM...
THIS WILL BE 14.
SO THIS ISN'T FROM THE SURGERY?

10:29.200 --> 10:31.100
SHE ACTUALLY SPEAKS SPANISH
AND FRENCH?

10:31.133 --> 10:34.033
ALEX... (speaks German)
DAS ist NOCH DAS HAUS.
AND GERMAN?

10:34.067 --> 10:37.467
SHE'S HYPOVENTILATING. LET'S PUT
HER UNDER AND WORK ON THE BLEED.
CAN'T WE KEEP GOING
JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES?

10:37.500 --> 10:39.433
MAYBE SHE CAN GET HER MEMORY
BACK ALONG WITH THE LANGUAGES.

10:39.467 --> 10:41.400
IF WE DON'T
CONTROL THIS BLEED,

10:41.433 --> 10:45.300
SHE'LL LOSE A LOT MORE THAN
HER MEMORY. SHE'LL DIE.
(monitor beeping)

10:45.333 --> 10:47.667
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
SO FAST?
UH, DOCTORS?

10:47.700 --> 10:49.633
COOPER, SHE'S CROWNING.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.400
ALL RIGHT,
JUST DON'T PUSH, LISA.
OH, PUSH? OKAY.

10:52.433 --> 10:54.333
NO! NO, DON'T PUSH, LISA.

10:54.367 --> 10:57.033
THE CORD'S WRAPPED AROUND
THE BABY'S NECK.
OH, I'M SORRY!
I CAN'T HELP IT!

10:57.067 --> 10:59.233
GOD! OH!

10:59.267 --> 11:01.300
(screams)

11:01.333 --> 11:03.233
(gasps)

11:03.267 --> 11:05.533
(Cooper) I'LL HOLD HER.
YOU CLAMP AND CUT.
IS SHE OKAY?

11:05.567 --> 11:07.200
HANG 20 OF OXYTOCIN.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.400
***

11:08.433 --> 11:11.300
8 FRENCH SUCTION CATHETER.

11:11.333 --> 11:14.433
WHY ISN'T SHE CRYING?
DR. FREEDMAN'S
GONNA BE WORKING ON HER.

11:14.467 --> 11:16.600
WE NEED TO FOCUS
ON YOUR RIGHT NOW, LISA.

11:16.633 --> 11:19.067
FORTUNATELY, YOU'RE NOT
BLEEDING THAT MUCH,

11:19.100 --> 11:22.233
SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
REMOVE THE PLACENTA BY...

11:22.267 --> 11:25.567
BY--BY WHAT? BY WHAT?
(monitor beeping erratically)

11:25.600 --> 11:27.333
PUT HER UNDER, NOW.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:27.367 --> 11:30.200
HER UTERUS MUST HAVE RUPTURED
BECAUSE OF THE PLACENTA ACCRETA.

11:30.233 --> 11:32.700
WE HAVE TO OPEN HER UP.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THE BABY'S NOT CRYING.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.233
(woman) B.P.'s 58 OVER 32.
DON'T PUT ME UNDER
TILL THE BABY CRIES.

11:35.267 --> 11:37.500
WE DON'T HAVE TIME, LISA.

11:37.533 --> 11:40.400
WE HAVE TO
PUT YOU UNDER RIGHT NOW.
(baby crying)

11:40.433 --> 11:42.800
GO, ADDISON.
OKAY.

11:42.833 --> 11:44.600
HANG TWO UNITS OF B-POSITIVE
AND MAKE SURE

11:44.633 --> 11:47.067
WE HAVE PLENTY ON STANDBY.
SHE'S GONNA EXSANGUINATE

11:47.100 --> 11:49.267
IF WE DON'T MOVE QUICKLY,
PEOPLE. 10-BLADE.

11:56.733 --> 11:58.633
LISA LOST A LOT OF BLOOD,

11:58.667 --> 12:00.567
WE HAD TO PUT THE BABY
ON OXYGEN,

12:00.600 --> 12:02.433
BUT THEY ARE BOTH STABLE.

12:02.467 --> 12:04.667
WHO'S THE FATHER?
WHAT?

12:04.700 --> 12:06.567
YOU SAID YOU SENT OFF
FOR THE PATERNITY TEST.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.133
WHICH ONE OF US
IS THE FATHER?
DID LISA SAY ANYTHING,

12:09.167 --> 12:10.800
HER DECISION ABOUT THE BABY?

12:10.833 --> 12:14.233
LISA LOST A LOT OF BLOOD,

12:14.267 --> 12:16.700
WE HAD TO PUT THE BABY
ON OXYGEN,

12:16.733 --> 12:18.200
BUT THEY ARE BOTH STABLE.

12:18.233 --> 12:20.133
I SAY IT AGAIN
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE

12:20.167 --> 12:22.467
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME
THE FIRST TIME.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.433
THEY ALMOST DIED.
LISA ALMOST DIED.

12:25.467 --> 12:27.367
AND SO I DIDN'T HAVE TIME,

12:27.400 --> 12:29.433
WHAT, WITH, UM, TRYING
TO SAVE HER LIFE,

12:29.467 --> 12:32.200
TO PAUSE AND CHECK ON
THE PATERNITY TEST

12:32.233 --> 12:34.067
OR ASK HER
ABOUT THE BABY'S FUTURE.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.500
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

12:36.533 --> 12:38.233
C-CAN--CAN WE SEE THE BABY?

12:38.267 --> 12:42.100
NO. NONE OF YOU GO NEAR LISA
OR THE BABY UNTIL I SAY SO.

12:42.133 --> 12:46.667
THE CHILD IS NOT A POSSESSION
THAT YOU FIGHT OVER.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.600
AND BY THE WAY,
NOT THAT YOU ASKED,

12:48.633 --> 12:51.367
IT'S A GIRL--
6 POUNDS, 9 OUNCES.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.367
(door closes)

12:55.100 --> 12:58.133
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:08.633 --> 13:10.700
I DON'T REMEMBER.

13:10.733 --> 13:12.400
HEY.

13:12.433 --> 13:15.300
WE GOT IT, THE BLEED.
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.233
BY THE WAY, UH,
YOU ROCKED THAT SURGERY.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.167
YOU SPOKE THREE LANGUAGES.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.467
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

13:23.300 --> 13:26.700
THE SURGERY WAS SUP--

13:26.733 --> 13:30.467
I TH--I THOUGHT I WOULD...

13:30.500 --> 13:32.533
(sobs)

13:32.567 --> 13:33.800
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

13:33.833 --> 13:37.667
WHAT IF... WHAT IF
I NEVER REMEMBER ANYTHING?

13:45.433 --> 13:48.700
YOU SICK, O'MALLEY?

13:48.733 --> 13:50.067
YOU FEEL FINE.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.533
TAKE AN ASPIRIN
AND GET OFF MY CLEAN BED.

13:52.567 --> 13:54.833
YOU BEEN MARRIED
A LONG TIME, RIGHT?

13:54.867 --> 13:57.400
O'MALLEY, I DO NOT HAVE TIME
TO ANSWER--

13:57.433 --> 14:00.633
DID YOU HAVE DOUBTS...
ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE?

14:00.667 --> 14:02.633
I DON'T MEAN,
UH, INSECURITIES.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.267
I MEAN REALLY SERIOUS DOUBTS.
DR. BAILEY, I NEED YOU
TO SIGN THIS

14:05.300 --> 14:07.067
BEFORE I CAN DISCHARGE
BED TEN.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.800
NO. HE'S SUPPOSED TO GET
AN I.V. DOSE BEFORE DISCHARGE.

14:09.833 --> 14:12.133
WHY DON'T PEOPLE LISTEN?

14:15.233 --> 14:18.100
SOMEDAY YOU'LL HAVE TO
EXPLAIN TO ME

14:18.133 --> 14:20.067
HOW ANTIBIOTICS
ACTUALLY WORK.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.367
THEY ARE MIRACULOUS.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.733
GOOD AFTERNOON.

14:22.767 --> 14:25.067
UH, DR. BAILEY ASKED ME
TO LOOK IN.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.200
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.467
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU
TO RADIOLOGY

14:29.500 --> 14:31.067
TO GET A CENTRAL LINE

14:31.067 --> 14:33.133
TO CONTINUE YOUR
I.V. ANTIBIOTICS OUTPATIENT.

14:33.167 --> 14:35.600
OKAY.

14:35.633 --> 14:37.533
HEY, WILL YOU SHOW YOUR DAD
THE CAFETERIA?

14:37.567 --> 14:40.333
SURE. WE'RE ON TO YOU,
YOU KNOW?

14:40.367 --> 14:41.633
WHAT?

14:46.600 --> 14:48.500
DR. BAILEY.

14:48.533 --> 14:50.433
I WAS...
LOOKING FOR SOME PRIVACY,

14:50.467 --> 14:52.167
AND, UH, I DIDN'T THINK

14:52.200 --> 14:54.100
ANYONE WOULD COME
LOOKING FOR ME DOWN HERE.

14:54.133 --> 14:55.300
I APOLOGIZE.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.133
NO PROBLEM.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

14:57.167 --> 14:58.600
UH, DR. BAILEY.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.667
YEAH.

15:00.700 --> 15:04.467
UM, YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
A LONG TIME NOW, RIGHT?

15:04.500 --> 15:07.433
DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS
IF ONE PERSON...

15:07.467 --> 15:09.467
IS--IS MORE READY?

15:09.500 --> 15:12.400
O'MALLEY!

15:12.433 --> 15:13.500
YEAH.

15:13.533 --> 15:16.333
COME HERE.

15:16.367 --> 15:18.433
YES. HI, DR. BURKE.

15:18.467 --> 15:21.133
I WANT THE TWO OF YOU
TO TALK TO EACH OTHER.

15:21.167 --> 15:22.700
I WANT YOU TO TALK

15:22.733 --> 15:24.767
TO EACH OTHER
AND LEAVE MY MARRIAGE OUT OF IT.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.633
I ALSO WANT YOU TO LEAVE
MY CLINIC OUT OF IT.

15:27.667 --> 15:30.300
AND BY THAT, I MEAN GET OUT.
I NEED THE SPACE,

15:30.333 --> 15:33.300
I NEED THE PEACE, I NEED
THE QUIET, AND I NEED IT NOW.
SORRY.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.133
YEAH, RIGHT, SORRY.
(clears throat)

15:38.167 --> 15:41.633
COOPER, YOU'RE BLOCKING
THE CAFFEINE.

15:41.667 --> 15:43.567
HE'S BLOCKING
THE CAFFEINE.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.567
COOPER, IF YOU MOVE,
I'LL GIVE YOU A COOKIE.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.067
(sighs)
HEY, DID SOMETHING GO WRONG
WITH LISA'S SURGERY?

15:48.100 --> 15:50.833
NO, UH, WE HANDLED IT.
ADDISON--SHE IS, UH,

15:50.867 --> 15:52.467
PRETTY EXCELLENT.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.700
SHE'S PRETTY EXCELLENT.

15:53.733 --> 15:56.233
(sighs)

15:56.267 --> 15:58.167
OKAY, ONLY BECAUSE
YOU'VE SIGHED TWICE...

15:58.200 --> 15:59.800
WHAT'S THE MATTER, COOPER?

16:02.833 --> 16:06.167
I DON'T GO TO HOOKERS.
I DON'T GO TO STRIP CLUBS.

16:06.200 --> 16:09.100
I MEET WOMEN ON THE INTERNET
THAT WANT TO MEET ME.

16:09.133 --> 16:11.833
SO I LIKE 'EM A LITTLE YOUNGER
AND A LITTLE DIRTIER.

16:11.867 --> 16:13.467
IS THAT WRONG?

16:15.367 --> 16:18.333
IT'S WRONG?
YOU NEED TO MEET
A GROWN-UP.

16:18.367 --> 16:20.267
YOU NEED TO DATE
SOMEONE YOUR OWN AGE.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.200
SOMEONE WITHOUT
A PORNY INTERNET NAME

16:22.233 --> 16:24.067
AND--AND PERHAPS
NO CRIMINAL PAST.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.800
A NICE GIRL.
A VIABLE GIRL.

16:25.833 --> 16:28.333
SOMEONE WITH WHOM YOU CAN
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP.
YOU'RE A RESPECTED DOCTOR.

16:28.367 --> 16:31.233
GO OUT IN THE REAL WORLD,
MEET A WOMAN YOUR OWN AGE

16:31.267 --> 16:33.600
AND ASK HER OUT.
BE A MAN, COOPER.

16:33.633 --> 16:36.333
BE A MAN.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.533
(door opens)

16:45.567 --> 16:48.067
THERE YOU ARE.

16:48.067 --> 16:51.167
I JUST STOPPED BY TO SEE HOW
LISA AND THE BABY ARE DOING.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.667
OH. (sniffles)

16:53.700 --> 16:55.433
YOU OKAY?

16:55.467 --> 16:57.733
YEAH. I JUST--I...

16:57.767 --> 16:59.633
I HAD A LITTLE
TOO MUCH SURGERY TODAY.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.567
BUT I'M--I'M GOOD.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.733
(sniffles)

17:03.767 --> 17:06.500
YOU LOOK GOOD.
(chuckles)

17:06.533 --> 17:10.300
YOU LOOK... BEAUTIFUL.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.233
SAM TOLD ME THAT I HAD TO
STAY AWAY FROM YOU

17:13.267 --> 17:15.733
BECAUSE YOU'RE
NAOMI'S FRIEND, BUT--
STOP IT.

17:15.767 --> 17:17.133
WHAT?
YOU'RE FLIRTING.

17:17.167 --> 17:20.067
WHAT'S WRONG WITH FLIRTING?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

17:20.067 --> 17:22.767
WHAT'S WRONG IS THAT I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR IT.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.467
I AM... OUT OF TIME.
I MISSED MY CHANCE.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.667
AND NOW I HAVE TWO EGGS LEFT.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.567
I MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE NO EGGS LEFT.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.200
I AM EGG-LESS.

17:31.233 --> 17:33.133
NAOMI SAYS
THAT SHE'S DRIED UP?

17:33.167 --> 17:35.067
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S DRIED UP.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.833
I'M ALL BARREN
AND DRIED UP.

17:36.867 --> 17:39.500
AND I HAVE CLEARLY
BEEN WASTING MY TIME ON MEN.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.633
I MEAN, I MIGHT AS WELL
TAKE UP HOBBIES,

17:41.667 --> 17:43.333
LIKE NEEDLEPOINT

17:43.367 --> 17:46.267
OR, UM, COLLECTING THOSE LITTLE
CERAMIC DOLLS, YOU KNOW?

17:46.300 --> 17:48.200
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
DRIED UP WOMEN DO.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.433
THEY DO NEEDLEPOINT.

17:49.467 --> 17:51.333
THEY DO NOT WASTE THEIR TIME
FLIRTING WITH MEN

17:51.367 --> 17:53.500
WHO CLEARLY
JUST WANT TO GET LAID.

17:53.533 --> 17:56.300
(voice breaks) THEY DO NOT
WASTE THEIR TIME...

17:56.333 --> 17:59.567
TELLING OVERLY PERSONAL...

17:59.600 --> 18:03.100
INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR EGGS
TO TOTAL STRANGERS.

18:03.133 --> 18:05.067
OH, MY GOD. I'M SORRY.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:07.333 --> 18:08.567
(sighs)

18:08.600 --> 18:10.767
I'M GONNA KISS YOU.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.333
I'M GONNA KISS YOU
WITH TONGUE.

18:13.367 --> 18:17.167
I'M GONNA KISS YOU
SO YOU FEEL IT. OKAY?

18:19.133 --> 18:21.233
OKAY.

18:21.267 --> 18:24.167
***

18:32.633 --> 18:34.533
MM.

18:34.567 --> 18:37.467
***

18:41.333 --> 18:43.767
MM.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.667
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

18:49.700 --> 18:52.300
TO REMIND YOU...

18:52.333 --> 18:54.233
THAT YOU'RE NOT DRIED UP.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.233
***

18:57.267 --> 19:00.433
IF YOU NEED ME
TO REMIND YOU AGAIN...

19:00.467 --> 19:03.333
LET ME KNOW.

19:03.367 --> 19:06.233
OKAY.

19:06.267 --> 19:09.667
***

19:09.700 --> 19:12.633
(sighs)

19:16.633 --> 19:18.533
(gasps)
WHEN DID
THE CRAMPING START?

19:18.567 --> 19:20.333
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
WHAT IS IT? IS IT--

19:20.367 --> 19:21.333
PROBABLY NOTHING SERIOUS.

19:21.367 --> 19:24.067
IT COULD JUST BE A REACTION
TO THE ANTIBIOTICS.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.833
WE MAY HAVE TO SWITCH
TO ANOTHER ONE,

19:25.867 --> 19:27.500
BUT IT MAY MEAN
ANOTHER NIGHT HERE.
OH.

19:27.533 --> 19:29.200
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

19:29.233 --> 19:31.167
IT'S OKAY.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.100
WAIT.

19:39.133 --> 19:41.567
I KNOW--I KNOW THAT
YOU THINK WE'RE AWFUL,

19:41.600 --> 19:43.400
AND I THINK THAT WE'RE AWFUL.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.500
I JUST, UM...

19:45.533 --> 19:48.333
I JUST WANTED A BABY
SO BADLY.

19:48.367 --> 19:49.533
I JUST WANTED A BABY.

19:49.567 --> 19:51.467
AND I DON'T CARE
WHO THE FATHER IS,

19:51.500 --> 19:53.400
I DON'T CARE
IF THE BABY'S MINE.

19:53.433 --> 19:56.767
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THE BABY.
IS--IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

19:56.800 --> 19:59.733
JUST TELL ME
THAT SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

20:03.133 --> 20:05.567
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.267
THANK YOU.

20:09.300 --> 20:12.233
YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:18.067 --> 20:20.267
I HEAR CALLIE'S
GOING TO BE A BRIDESMAID.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.767
YEAH.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.767
WOULD YOU, UM, SAY THAT
YOU WERE THE ONE

20:25.800 --> 20:28.833
THAT NEEDED MORE URGING
TO GET MARRIED?

20:28.867 --> 20:30.367
OH, I HADN'T...

20:30.400 --> 20:32.300
REALLY BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT.

20:32.333 --> 20:37.200
I--IT JUST, UH, SEEMED LIKE
A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME.

20:37.233 --> 20:39.667
YOU AND CRISTINA HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER FOR A WHILE.

20:39.700 --> 20:40.733
YOU GOT MARRIED PRETTY FAST.

20:40.767 --> 20:43.233
SO IN THEORY IT'S BETTER
TO KNOW SOMEONE PRETTY WELL.

20:43.267 --> 20:45.700
WAY BETTER THAN--
STILL, NO GUARANTEES.

20:45.733 --> 20:48.467
I-I DON'T...

20:48.500 --> 20:50.533
BELIEVE IN DIVORCE.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.567
NEITHER DO I.

20:54.433 --> 20:56.067
IS IT POSSIBLE...

20:56.100 --> 21:01.167
DO YOU THINK,
TO LOVE TWO PEOPLE...

21:01.200 --> 21:03.100
AT THE SAME TIME?

21:03.133 --> 21:05.733
I, UH...

21:05.767 --> 21:09.600
I'M STILL HOPING IT'S POSSIBLE
JUST TO LOVE ONE PERSON.

21:11.667 --> 21:12.567
HEY.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.467
SO, UH, IT'S NOT GONNA BE
TOO WEIRD, RIGHT?

21:14.500 --> 21:16.400
ME AS A BRIDESMAID?
NO, NO, IT'S FINE.

21:16.433 --> 21:19.633
'CAUSE I CAN TELL CRISTINA--
I SAID IT'S FINE.
REALLY, NO WORRIES.

21:19.667 --> 21:21.567
SO, UM...
DID GEORGE TELL YOU

21:21.600 --> 21:24.200
HE'S THINKING ABOUT
TRANSFERRING TO MERCY WEST?

21:24.233 --> 21:27.300
YEAH. SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD IDEA.

21:27.333 --> 21:29.767
SO WE'RE FINE?

21:29.800 --> 21:31.667
OH, WE ARE. FINE.

21:31.700 --> 21:35.433
HEY, THAT LAST DRESS
WAS OKAY, WASN'T IT?

21:35.467 --> 21:37.667
I MEAN, IT WAS TOO TIGHT
AND I COULDN'T BREATHE,

21:37.700 --> 21:40.333
BUT... A WEDDING'S
JUST ONE DAY, RIGHT?

21:40.367 --> 21:42.067
YEAH.
YEAH.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.600
YEAH.

21:43.633 --> 21:46.067
YEAH.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.167
***

21:48.200 --> 21:50.100
WE GOT PAUL'S M.R.I. BACK,
AND I'VE CONSULTED

21:50.133 --> 21:51.800
WITH DR. STRALEY
AT SLOAN-KETTERING.

21:51.833 --> 21:54.633
WE FOUND A TUMOR
ON YOUR ADRENAL GLAND.

21:54.667 --> 21:56.667
ALL RIGHT? IT SITS
RIGHT ON TOP OF THE KIDNEY,

21:56.700 --> 21:59.633
AND IT'S WHAT'S BEEN CAUSING
YOUR LOW SEX DRIVE.

21:59.667 --> 22:03.267
SO IT WASN'T ME?
HE'S GOT A CONDITION.

22:03.300 --> 22:06.533
A-A TUMOR,
THAT'S NOT TOO...

22:06.567 --> 22:09.133
YOU CAN TREAT THAT, RIGHT?

22:09.167 --> 22:11.633
THESE TUMORS ARE USUALLY
AGGRESSIVE AND FOUND LATE

22:11.667 --> 22:15.067
BECAUSE THE SYMPTOMS
ARE SO SUBTLE.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.567
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

22:16.600 --> 22:20.567
TREATMENT IS DIFFICULT
AND RISKY, BUT THERE IS HOPE.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.767
OH, MY GOD, HONEY,

22:21.800 --> 22:23.700
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I YELLED AT YOU.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.400
I'M SO SORRY.

22:25.433 --> 22:28.233
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.
IT'S OKAY.

22:28.267 --> 22:30.167
NO, I'M HORRIBLE.
I'M SO SORRY.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.367
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.667
HI.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.500
HI.

OKAY, LOOK, YOU MAY BE
A FIGMENT OF MY IMAGINATION,

23:12.433 --> 23:14.267

COMPLETELY INSANE,

23:14.300 --> 23:15.800
I DON'T KNOW.

PAYBACK FOR MY CRIMES

KARMIC LEVEL,

23:20.700 --> 23:22.067
I DON'T KNOW.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.567

I'M SORRY

WELL... BYE.

23:48.367 --> 23:51.133
I AM SUCH A SCREWUP...

23:51.167 --> 23:52.633
IN MY LIFE. (chuckles)

23:52.667 --> 23:56.500
UP UNTIL NOW, I HAVE BEEN
REALLY GREAT AT ONE THING.

23:56.533 --> 24:01.067
I AM GREAT...
AT BEING PAUL'S WIFE.

24:01.100 --> 24:03.200
AND I THOUGHT
HE DIDN'T WANT ME ANYMORE.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.667
I THOUGHT--I WAS SURE
THAT HE WAS IN LOVE

24:05.700 --> 24:07.067
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

24:07.067 --> 24:08.533
OF COURSE YOU WERE.

24:08.567 --> 24:11.200
I LIED TO PAUL.

24:11.233 --> 24:13.467
I WAS WITH A MAN

24:13.500 --> 24:17.233
THAT NIGHT
THAT I DIDN'T COME HOME.

24:17.267 --> 24:20.133
I DIDN'T EVEN FIND HIM
THAT ATTRACTIVE.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.200
I JUST TOLD MYSELF

24:21.233 --> 24:24.333
THAT I WASN'T GONNA SETTLE
FOR BEING ALONE, YOU KNOW?

24:24.367 --> 24:27.233
KATHY, YOU WERE REACTING
TO WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF YOU.

24:27.267 --> 24:29.167
THERE WAS NO WAY
YOU COULD KNOW

24:29.200 --> 24:31.533
WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON.

24:31.567 --> 24:33.633
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

24:40.233 --> 24:43.467

WHAT YOU'RE GREAT AT.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.333
YOU LOVE YOUR HUSBAND.

24:51.533 --> 24:55.300
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TELL ME THAT A LOT, OKAY?

24:55.333 --> 24:58.067
OKAY.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.333

25:01.367 --> 25:03.567
HEY, EVERYONE ELSE IS GONE.
I WAS HEADING OUT.

25:03.600 --> 25:07.800
UH, UNLESS--I WAS GONNA GET
SOME FOOD. YOU WANT SOMETHING?

25:07.833 --> 25:10.067
OH... NO.

YES, I CAN.
NO, YOU CAN'T.

25:23.400 --> 25:24.667

25:31.067 --> 25:33.300
YOU CAN'T USE "THE GRADUATE"

MADE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN

WE MOVED HERE?

WHY ARE YOU WARNING ME
ABOUT HIM?

26:29.433 --> 26:31.533
WHAT, IS HE LIKE
A SERIAL KILLER? IS HE A FELON?

26:31.567 --> 26:33.467
IS HE SECRETLY
MY EX-HUSBAND'S BEST FRIEND?

26:33.500 --> 26:35.800
HIS WIFE DIED
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

26:35.833 --> 26:38.100
NOW I FEEL SHALLOW.

26:38.133 --> 26:40.133
NO, IT'S JUST...

26:40.167 --> 26:41.800
HE CAN'T CONNECT
WITH WOMEN.

26:41.833 --> 26:42.833
HE'S A GOOD MAN,

26:42.867 --> 26:45.700
BUT IF YOU WANT SOMEONE
WHO'S GONNA BE THERE,

26:45.733 --> 26:47.433

HEY, EX-BEST FRIEND.
OOH.

27:41.567 --> 27:44.067
HEY, EX-HUSBAND.
YOU ARE DRUNK.

27:44.100 --> 27:46.133
TEN MORE MINUTES,
AND I START DANCING,

27:46.167 --> 27:48.233
AND I REQUIRE COMPANY.

27:59.833 --> 28:02.200

28:02.233 --> 28:05.200
OVER THE YEARS,
THERE HAVE BEEN TEMPTATIONS,

28:05.233 --> 28:08.367
BUT, NO... I DIDN'T.

28:08.400 --> 28:11.600
WAS THERE
A LOT OF FIGHTING OR...

28:11.633 --> 28:14.800
HARDLY EVER.

28:14.833 --> 28:17.567
HONESTLY...

28:17.600 --> 28:20.133
IT WAS BAD, WHAT I DID.

28:22.633 --> 28:25.700
I HAVE NO GOOD REASON.

28:25.733 --> 28:28.400
I WOKE UP ONE DAY...

28:28.433 --> 28:31.200
AND I COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

28:31.233 --> 28:34.267
IT WASN'T EVEN A CHOICE.

28:34.300 --> 28:37.700
I HAD A THOUGHT...

28:37.733 --> 28:40.467
NEXT THING YOU KNOW...

28:40.500 --> 28:42.733
I'M BURNING IT ALL DOWN.

28:42.767 --> 28:45.233
I LEFT HER.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.267
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

28:49.300 --> 28:52.067
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

28:52.067 --> 28:54.067
WHAT KIND OF A PERSON
DOES THAT?

28:54.100 --> 28:55.833
HELL IF I KNOW.

28:55.867 --> 28:58.567
AND I DID IT, TOO.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.700
(exhales)

29:03.600 --> 29:05.600
SO I RAN INTO ALLAN...

29:05.633 --> 29:07.433
AT WHOLE FOODS.

29:07.467 --> 29:08.633
WANNA HEAR SOMETHING FUNNY?

29:08.667 --> 29:10.567
HE SAID HE DIDN'T BELIEVE
IN MARRIAGE,

29:10.600 --> 29:12.500
THAT MARRIAGE WASN'T FOR HIM.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.433
BUT I GUESS THAT WAS WRONG,

29:14.467 --> 29:17.167
BECAUSE IT ONLY TOOK HIM
FOUR MONTHS.

29:17.200 --> 29:21.067
FOUR MONTHS AFTER WE BROKE UP,
HE GOT MARRIED,

29:21.100 --> 29:23.800
TO SOMEONE WHO CAN'T BE
MORE THAN 25 YEARS OLD.

29:23.833 --> 29:26.167
ISN'T THAT FUNNY?
(chuckles)

29:40.200 --> 29:42.833
IT HEADS OFF REJECTION.

29:42.867 --> 29:44.067
WHAT?

29:44.100 --> 29:46.700
THAT'S WHY I LIKE
THE INTERNET.

29:46.733 --> 29:49.600
I CAN'T STAND THE...

29:49.633 --> 29:52.733
IT'S HORRIBLE,
BEING REJECTED.

29:52.767 --> 29:56.200
IT IS.

30:05.867 --> 30:10.700
PRESTON, I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A LATE SURGERY.

30:13.100 --> 30:17.200
YOU KNOW ALL THAT...
"I TRUST YOU" CRAP?

30:17.233 --> 30:20.267
YOU'VE BEEN PULLING THAT ON ME
SINCE I WAS THIS HIGH.

30:20.300 --> 30:22.167
PRESTON, LANGUAGE.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.267
NO.

30:23.300 --> 30:27.733
"I TRUST YOU" IS CODE FOR
"LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES."

30:27.767 --> 30:29.233
THIS IS NOT A MISTAKE.

30:29.267 --> 30:31.167
I NEVER SAID
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.167
CRISTINA NEVER KNOWS
WHAT'S GOOD FOR HER.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.400
THAT'S WHO SHE IS.
PRESTON--

30:36.433 --> 30:37.667
SHE HATES CHANGE.

30:37.700 --> 30:40.567
I LEAD. I HAVE TO.
AND THEN SHE'S GRATEFUL.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.333
THAT'S HOW IT WAS WITH DATING,
WITH MOVING IN.

30:43.367 --> 30:46.133
THEN I'M PLEASED FOR YOU.

30:46.167 --> 30:49.100
LOOK, I AM GOING TO
MAKE HER HAPPY, MAMA.

30:49.133 --> 30:51.800
THE WEDDING IS A HUGE STEP,
AND SHE'S BEING A GREAT SPORT.

30:51.833 --> 30:53.200
YOU KNOW WHY?

30:53.233 --> 30:56.067
BECAUSE SHE WILL BE HAPPY
SOMEDAY.

30:56.100 --> 30:58.667
IF YOU ARE SO SURE...

30:58.700 --> 31:01.067
WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME?

31:08.300 --> 31:10.200
WHAT HAPPENED?
SHE'S SEPTIC.

31:10.233 --> 31:12.133
THE SOONER WE CAN GET HER
TO AN O.R.,

31:12.167 --> 31:13.700
THE SOONER WE CAN HELP HER.
LET'S MOVE. MOVE.

31:13.733 --> 31:16.167
RICHARD, WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?
EXTREMELY RARE COMPLICATION.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.167
TOXIC MEGACOLON
WITH A PERFORATION.

31:18.200 --> 31:21.467
CAN YOU GET YOUR DAD
OUT OF THIS ROOM, PLEASE?
THIS FAST? HOW COULD--

31:21.500 --> 31:23.400
SOMETIMES IT PROGRESSES
THIS RAPIDLY.

31:23.433 --> 31:25.533
VERY RARELY, BUT SOMETIMES.
WE BOOKED AN O.R.

31:25.567 --> 31:27.433
YOU'RE GOING INTO SURGERY
RIGHT NOW?

31:27.467 --> 31:29.367
I-I DIDN'T SIGN
A CONSENT FORM.
SHE NEEDS SURGERY
RIGHT NOW, THATCHER.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.200
NOT TOMORROW, NOT LATER TODAY.
RIGHT NOW.

31:31.233 --> 31:32.833
THATCHER.
HONEY, LISTEN--

31:32.867 --> 31:35.200
WE NEED YOU
TO STAY BACK, OKAY?

31:41.167 --> 31:44.400
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
THIS HAPPENS.

31:44.433 --> 31:45.600
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

31:45.633 --> 31:47.567
WE'RE LOSING HER PULSE
SHE'S CODING.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.233
OKAY, LET'S GO.
LET'S MOVE. MOVE.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.767
SHE'S OKAY, HUH?

32:01.800 --> 32:03.800
I MEAN,
AFTER ALL SHE WENT THROUGH,

32:03.833 --> 32:05.700
SHE STILL LOOKS
PRETTY AWESOME.

32:05.733 --> 32:07.633
(Cooper)
LISA, WE NEED TO KNOW

32:07.667 --> 32:09.267
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
WITH THE BABY.

32:09.300 --> 32:11.100
CAROL--
SHE WANTS THIS SO BAD.

32:11.133 --> 32:15.433
THIS IS ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT.
WE DID FIND OUT THE PATERNITY.

32:15.467 --> 32:19.500
NO, NO. I DON'T WANNA KNOW.

32:19.533 --> 32:23.067
SHE'S AWESOME, THOUGH.

32:23.100 --> 32:25.367
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE
RIGHT NOW.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.333
NO. I KNOW
WHAT I WANT TO DO.

32:27.367 --> 32:28.700
(coos)

32:28.733 --> 32:30.600
***

32:30.633 --> 32:33.600
OH, HI.
(Pete) LISA GAVE THE BABY
TO CAROL.

32:33.633 --> 32:35.533
(Cooper) ON THE CONDITION
THEY'D ALL BE PART OF HER LIFE.

32:35.567 --> 32:38.300
SO IT TURNS OUT THE BABY
WILL HAVE THREE DADS ANYWAY.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.467
AND TWO MOMS.
LISA DID A GOOD THING.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.333
THEY LOOK HAPPY.

32:42.367 --> 32:44.300
***

32:44.333 --> 32:46.200
THEY LOOK LIKE A FAMILY.

32:46.233 --> 32:49.800

33:01.533 --> 33:03.700

33:15.367 --> 33:18.467
TO MERCY WEST--
I DON'T WANT YOU...

33:18.500 --> 33:22.133
IT'S NOT FAIR.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.067
I KNOW WE CAN'T HELP
WHAT HAPPENED,

33:24.100 --> 33:26.267
AND I KNOW
THAT WE DIDN'T...

33:26.300 --> 33:29.233
I STOOD IN THAT BRIDAL SHOP
WITH YOUR WIFE,

33:29.267 --> 33:32.533
AND I SMILED AND I TALKED,
AND I FELT LIKE...

33:32.567 --> 33:34.733
***

33:34.767 --> 33:36.100
IT'S NOT FAIR.

33:36.133 --> 33:38.067
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO
TO MERCY WEST

33:38.067 --> 33:40.567
BECAUSE I'M LOSING
MY BEST FRIEND,

33:40.600 --> 33:43.467
AND IT'S NOT FAIR.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.500
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

33:45.533 --> 33:48.433
***

33:50.333 --> 33:52.300

34:19.500 --> 34:20.767
WE CAN'T.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.433
I KNOW.

34:23.467 --> 34:25.167
(bell dings)

34:25.200 --> 34:26.567
HEY.

34:26.600 --> 34:29.067
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.
YOU READY TO GO?

34:29.100 --> 34:31.800
***

34:35.667 --> 34:39.100
A LOT OF FOLKS WOULD KILL
FOR WHAT YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW?

34:39.133 --> 34:41.067
A CLEAN SLATE.

34:41.067 --> 34:44.733
SO YOU DON'T REMEMBER?
SO WHAT?

34:44.767 --> 34:46.667
YOU'LL MAKE NEW MEMORIES.

34:46.700 --> 34:49.667
OH, WOW. LOOK AT THAT.

34:49.700 --> 34:51.533
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.767
HOW CAN YOU BE SO...

34:58.800 --> 35:01.200
YOU'RE SO GOOD WITH ME.

35:01.233 --> 35:04.100
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU
THAT YOU CAN'T BE THIS GOOD

35:04.133 --> 35:06.800
WITH SOMEONE
YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR?

35:06.833 --> 35:11.333
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, ALEX?

35:16.167 --> 35:18.433
MAYBE I DON'T REMEMBER.

35:18.467 --> 35:20.267
SO WHAT?

36:10.467 --> 36:13.067
YOU--YOU SAID
IT WAS REALLY SIMPLE

36:13.067 --> 36:16.400
AND THAT IT WAS THIS...
SMALL THING.

36:16.433 --> 36:17.767
IT WAS.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.100
SHE HAD THE HICCUPS.

36:22.833 --> 36:24.467
SHE CAME HERE...

36:24.500 --> 36:26.500
BECAUSE--
BECAUSE SHE TRUSTED YOU.

36:26.533 --> 36:27.733
***

36:27.767 --> 36:30.333
I TRUSTED YOU.

36:30.367 --> 36:32.267
MEREDITH, JUST STOP.
OKAY, JUST STOP.

36:32.300 --> 36:33.633
NO, DON'T. DON'T.

36:33.667 --> 36:35.167
JUST...

36:35.200 --> 36:37.267
AT SOME POINT, MAYBE WE ACCEPT

36:37.300 --> 36:41.600
THAT THE DREAM
HAS BECOME A NIGHTMARE.

36:41.633 --> 36:45.600
SHE HAD THE HICCUPS.
OH, GOD.

36:45.633 --> 36:47.767
THE HICCUPS.

36:47.800 --> 36:51.700
***

36:58.067 --> 37:00.100
THEY'VE LEFT.
IT'S JUST US.

OH, THANK GOD.

37:02.100 --> 37:06.100
OHH.

37:42.167 --> 37:44.100
LIMES.
LIMES.

37:44.133 --> 37:46.167
SO WHAT ARE WE
DRINKING TO THIS TIME?

37:46.200 --> 37:47.733
FRIENDS. CRAPPY FRIENDS.

37:47.767 --> 37:50.367

WE CONVINCE OURSELVES

38:13.833 --> 38:18.533
IT'S BETTER
THAT WE NEVER DREAM AT ALL.

38:18.567 --> 38:21.300
BUT THE STRONGEST OF US,

38:21.333 --> 38:24.400
THE MOST DETERMINED OF US,
WE HOLD ON TO THE DREAM.

38:24.433 --> 38:26.267
YOU'RE UGLY AND OLD.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.100
I'LL MISS YOU, TOO.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.500
THINK ABOUT IT.

38:40.533 --> 38:43.400
OR WE FIND OURSELVES
FACED WITH A FRESH DREAM

38:43.433 --> 38:45.433
WE NEVER CONSIDERED.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.233
HOLD THE DOOR.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.433
AGAINST ALL ODDS...

38:55.467 --> 38:58.067
FEELING HOPEFUL.

38:58.067 --> 39:00.333
THIS IS GONNA SOUND...

39:00.367 --> 39:03.100
WHEN NO ONE ELSE IS AROUND,

39:03.133 --> 39:07.733
THE ELEVATOR KIND OF, UH...

NOT.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.500
BECAUSE OF THE ELEVATORS
WHERE YOU COME FROM?

39:51.533 --> 39:54.233

APHRODISIAC ELEVATORS?
