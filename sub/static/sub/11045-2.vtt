00:01.502 --> 00:04.272
**

00:04.305 --> 00:07.141
I still can't believe you're
letting me stay here.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.309
As your pupil.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.479
Shining Armor's a
father! I'm an aunt!

00:11.512 --> 00:13.714
Your first friendship
lesson is going to be...

00:13.747 --> 00:16.050
reuniting with Sunburst!

00:16.084 --> 00:18.686
And yes, that's me. Yep.
Ha ha. Important wizard.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.189
The baby is an alicorn!?

00:21.222 --> 00:22.823
So, she could be a
super strong flyer

00:22.856 --> 00:24.825
and have crazy baby magic.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.060
[shattering glass]

00:26.094 --> 00:29.330
Without the Heart, the Crystal
Empire is about to be buried

00:29.363 --> 00:31.265
under a mountain
of ice and snow!

00:31.299 --> 00:33.267
* [dramatic music]

00:35.269 --> 00:38.572
* My little pony,
my little pony *

00:38.606 --> 00:40.541
* Aaaahhh

00:40.574 --> 00:42.576
* My little Pony

00:42.610 --> 00:45.179
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

00:45.213 --> 00:46.847
* My Little Pony

00:46.880 --> 00:49.483
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

00:49.517 --> 00:51.519
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

00:51.552 --> 00:53.687
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

00:53.721 --> 00:55.823
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

00:55.856 --> 00:57.858
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

00:57.891 --> 01:00.161
* To have my little pony

01:00.194 --> 01:03.464
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:03.497 --> 01:05.666
**

01:11.805 --> 01:14.875
Rarity: So, not only
can we not take part

01:14.908 --> 01:17.245
in a fabulous,
ancient ceremony,

01:17.278 --> 01:20.381
but we're also about
to be frozen solid!

01:20.414 --> 01:22.716
Without the Crystal Heart's
magical protection,

01:22.750 --> 01:25.753
the entire city is about to
become a winter wasteland.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.421
But what about
when King Sombra

01:27.455 --> 01:28.622
ruled the
Crystal Empire

01:28.656 --> 01:30.258
and the Crystal
Heart was missing?

01:30.291 --> 01:32.526
The city wasn't
covered in snow then.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.762
The Heart wasn't missing.
It was still in the Castle.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.864
King Sombra had
just hidden it.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.267
I'm afraid Twilight
is correct.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.769
And the storm clouds
are already forming.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.304
[thunderclap]

01:43.337 --> 01:45.673
I can totally fly up there
and bust those puppies.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.708
No problem.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.178
Celestia: I wouldn't
advise it, Rainbow Dash.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.846
Those storm clouds are not
like the ones you know.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.383
This far north, the weather
has a will of its own

01:55.416 --> 01:57.351
and now it will
only grow stronger,

01:57.385 --> 01:59.520
enveloping everything
in its path.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.322
Including the
Crystal Empire.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.490
And us along with it

02:06.560 --> 02:07.861
There's gotta be something.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.866
I know Princess Twilight
is keen on the two of us

02:12.900 --> 02:16.170
rekindling our friendship,
but it's been so long.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.706
I don't see how anything on
that list is going to help.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.309
I know, right? It's not
like there's some spell

02:21.342 --> 02:24.545
that would magically compel us
to pick up where we left off.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.880
Oh, actually, there's several.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.717
Mistmane's Material Amity,
Rockhoof's Rapport,

02:29.750 --> 02:31.685
Flashprance's Fellowship...

02:33.487 --> 02:34.888
But I get the
feeling the Princess

02:34.922 --> 02:36.557
isn't looking for a spell.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.192
Definitely not.

02:38.226 --> 02:39.393
Spike: Got it!

02:39.427 --> 02:41.729
"...and if all else
fails, ask them to share

02:41.762 --> 02:43.931
an embarrassing moment
from their past,

02:43.964 --> 02:46.334
maybe even something
they regret."

02:48.769 --> 02:50.838
Uh, I don't see how
that would help.

02:50.871 --> 02:54.375
Uh, yeah. We should just
get out of your mane.

02:54.408 --> 02:57.445
It's pretty obvious this isn't
going how Twilight hoped

02:57.478 --> 03:01.549
and I'm sure you have plenty
of important work to do.

03:01.582 --> 03:07.455
What? Oh. Right. Yes. [laugh]
No rest for the wizardly.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.589
Come on, Spike.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.657
[sigh]

03:09.690 --> 03:10.791
[door closes]

03:10.824 --> 03:13.994
* [dramatic music]

03:14.027 --> 03:16.697
[whistling wind]

03:16.730 --> 03:19.500
There must be a spell that can
restore the Crystal Heart.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.801
Perhaps.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.437
But it isn't something
that either of us know.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.706
The library here at the
Castle is nearly as extensive

03:25.739 --> 03:27.408
as the one in Canterlot.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.577
There's a good chance we
can find something there.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.412
Can you hold off the storm?

03:31.445 --> 03:34.615
Yes, for a time, but even our
magic will eventually succumb

03:34.648 --> 03:36.917
to the power of
the Frozen North.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.520
We will do what we can,
but you must hurry.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.394
[zap]

03:53.467 --> 03:56.270
I don't know how long it will
take to find the right spell,

03:56.304 --> 03:57.838
but you should probably
tell the crowd outside

03:57.871 --> 03:59.407
to get somewhere warm.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.642
And try not to mention
the Crystal Heart.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.544
We don't want to start a panic.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.245
Yes, ma'am!
Come on, girls!

04:06.814 --> 04:08.616
I'm going to need
all of your help;

04:08.649 --> 04:10.351
the Crystal library
is enormous.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.685
You can count on us, Twiley!

04:13.787 --> 04:14.355
[pow]

04:14.388 --> 04:15.923
AHHHHHHH!

04:17.991 --> 04:19.026
Where'd she go?

04:20.328 --> 04:26.934
[distant giggling]

04:26.967 --> 04:28.302
This way!

04:28.336 --> 04:31.305
[clattering hooves]

04:31.339 --> 04:34.742
Well, Spike, looks like my
biggest fears came true.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.610
I wouldn't be surprised
if Twilight decides

04:36.644 --> 04:39.046
to give up on me entirely.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.549
It's not your fault.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.685
I'm the one who said all
we needed was this list.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.587
[whoosh]

04:46.620 --> 04:50.624
It's not the list, Spike.
Or you. Or Twilight.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.661
I'm the one Sunburst doesn't
want to be friends with.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.397
I don't remember him saying
he didn't want to be friends.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.965
He didn't have to say it.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.702
Well, Twilight obviously thinks

05:01.735 --> 05:05.439
you're worth being
friends with and I do too.

05:05.473 --> 05:08.676
Aw thanks, Spike. At
least I have two friends,

05:08.709 --> 05:11.779
even if one of them
has dragon breath.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.514
[puff puff]

05:13.547 --> 05:17.117
Um, that's not dragon
breath. It's freezing!

05:17.150 --> 05:19.453
Oh. You're right!

05:19.487 --> 05:21.522
But I thought the Crystal
Heart was supposed to keep

05:21.555 --> 05:22.990
the cold weather out.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.059
It is, unless something's
happened! Come on!

05:26.093 --> 05:30.531
* [dramatic music]

05:30.564 --> 05:33.401
We're just saying that it
might not be the best idea

05:33.434 --> 05:35.135
to stay outside.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.137
I camped out all
night for this spot.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.972
I'm not about to
just give it up.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.576
Still, when you think about it,

05:42.610 --> 05:44.978
the view is just as good
a little further back,

05:45.012 --> 05:47.681
like inside your house.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.683
[murmurs]

05:49.717 --> 05:50.851
The Crystalling ceremony

05:50.884 --> 05:52.553
is one of our most
sacred traditions

05:52.586 --> 05:54.888
and when that foal is held
before the Crystal Heart,

05:54.922 --> 05:57.958
I plan to be as close to
the action as possible.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.627
Honestly, I don't know

05:59.660 --> 06:01.161
if there's gonna
be a Crystalling.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.964
The truth is the
baby's an alicorn

06:03.997 --> 06:05.866
and her magic's plum crazy

06:05.899 --> 06:09.403
so you might not want to
be that close after all.

06:09.437 --> 06:13.541
A baby alicorn? Wow. I
can't wait to see that!

06:13.574 --> 06:15.976
Oh, those little wings
are probably so cute!

06:16.009 --> 06:17.711
I know, right?

06:17.745 --> 06:22.416
Look, I am 100% sure the
Crystalling isn't happening.

06:22.450 --> 06:28.088
[explosions]

06:28.121 --> 06:30.123
No Crystalling, huh?

06:30.157 --> 06:32.125
Then why are they
starting a fireworks show?

06:32.159 --> 06:34.127
WOO-HOO!

06:38.866 --> 06:39.867
Young filly!

06:39.900 --> 06:41.201
Whee!

06:41.234 --> 06:42.903
Come back here!

06:42.936 --> 06:44.838
Come to your Auntie Pinkie Pie!

06:44.872 --> 06:48.442
Bridlebuck's Boat Chants,
Hayhoof's Intonements,

06:48.476 --> 06:51.979
Mystic Maps and Mazes.
[groan] Anything up there?

06:52.012 --> 06:55.983
Not yet. I'm not even sure
how these are organized.

06:56.016 --> 07:04.992
[cooing]

07:05.025 --> 07:08.762
Shining Armor, I thought you
were taking care of the baby.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.230
[cooing]

07:10.263 --> 07:11.198
I'm trying!

07:15.168 --> 07:16.937
Whoo hoo hoo!

07:16.970 --> 07:18.806
Gotcha!

07:18.839 --> 07:20.541
[pop pop]

07:20.574 --> 07:22.109
Or not.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.477
Whee!

07:23.511 --> 07:34.522
**

07:34.555 --> 07:35.122
[crash]

07:35.155 --> 07:38.559
**

07:38.592 --> 07:39.993
What is going on!

07:40.027 --> 07:41.695
You want the long or
the short version?

07:41.729 --> 07:43.063
Short?

07:43.096 --> 07:45.265
The baby's an alicorn and
she accidentally destroyed

07:45.298 --> 07:47.768
the Crystal Heart so Twilight
and Cadance are looking

07:47.801 --> 07:49.870
for a spell to put
it back together

07:49.903 --> 07:51.104
and save the Crystal Empire.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.940
Oh.

07:52.973 --> 07:53.941
[crash]

07:53.974 --> 07:54.908
[giggle]

07:57.645 --> 08:00.648
What about this? Trotter's
Tome of Reliquary?

08:02.950 --> 08:04.585
I think this is it!

08:04.618 --> 08:08.255
Spell of Relic Reconstitution!
I can't believe we found it.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.857
It's a good thing too.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.759
Without this, I don't
know what we'd do.

08:11.792 --> 08:12.926
[giggles]

08:12.960 --> 08:19.066
[crashing]

08:19.099 --> 08:20.000
[gasp]

08:20.033 --> 08:21.735
* [dramatic sting]

08:21.769 --> 08:22.570
Oops.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.009
That spell was the only thing
we found in the whole library

08:29.042 --> 08:31.278
that was even close
to what we needed.

08:31.311 --> 08:34.047
I'm so sorry,
Twilight!

08:34.081 --> 08:35.883
It's not your fault, Starlight.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.151
None of us were
expecting any of this.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.253
Do you think you can
remember the spell?

08:40.287 --> 08:42.155
I only read it through once!

08:42.189 --> 08:44.658
Well, if anypony can
exactly remember something

08:44.692 --> 08:46.694
she read for the first
time two minutes ago,

08:46.727 --> 08:48.729
it's you, Twilight.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.632
I'll try, but I'm not
sure how long it'll take.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.967
[whistling wind]

08:54.001 --> 08:55.903
Is quickly an option?

08:55.936 --> 08:57.605
I'll help if I can.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.173
But we should evacuate
the city just in case.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.342
You need to lead everypony
to the train station

09:02.375 --> 09:04.244
before the tracks freeze over.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.246
We will. But between
you and Twilight,

09:06.279 --> 09:08.048
I'm sure you'll
remember the spell.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.087
I only hope this spell
is the one we need.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.792
Is there anything I can do?

09:18.826 --> 09:21.929
I don't think so. I'm just
sorry about your lesson.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.363
That doesn't matter now.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.966
Sunburst and I don't have
anything in common anyway.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.201
He's a big important wizard

09:28.235 --> 09:31.071
and I'm relearning everything
I ever thought I knew.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.774
Sunburst? I don't
recognize the name,

09:33.807 --> 09:35.909
but if he's an
important wizard,

09:35.943 --> 09:37.277
you should
bring him here.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.913
Maybe he'll know what to
do if the spell fails.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.014
Of course!

09:42.683 --> 09:44.051
You better go with her, Spike.

09:50.858 --> 09:51.759
[thunderclap]

09:57.230 --> 09:59.599
Sunburst! Haven't
you looked outside?

10:01.201 --> 10:04.905
Snow? That's not right.
The Crystal Heart...

10:04.938 --> 10:06.740
...is gone. The baby...

10:06.774 --> 10:09.276
Shining Armor and Cadance's
baby. It's an alicorn.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.345
Really!?

10:12.379 --> 10:14.314
Really! And her magic
is a little berserk

10:14.347 --> 10:16.116
and, well, I guess she
destroyed the Heart.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.818
But Twilight thinks
she can fix it

10:17.851 --> 10:19.319
and Princess Cadance
thought you could help.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.889
Me?

10:21.922 --> 10:24.257
Of course! You're an important
wizard in the Crystal Empire.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.826
It just makes sense.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.027
Right.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.328
Right, right, right, right.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.933
You know, I'd like to
help. I-I really would.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.002
I-I just have so much, um...

10:35.035 --> 10:36.870
important wizard work
to do around here.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.171
Huh?

10:39.372 --> 10:41.408
Applejack: You can't stay here!

10:41.441 --> 10:44.177
Did I mention this was
a Royal Crystalling?

10:44.211 --> 10:46.413
When the Crystaller holds
the young one aloft,

10:46.446 --> 10:49.817
all of the Empire will
share their joy and light

10:49.850 --> 10:51.785
and the Crystal Heart
will beat stronger

10:51.819 --> 10:54.087
than it ever has before.

10:54.121 --> 10:57.124
It really is a moving ceremony.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.393
I really don't think
it's going to happen.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.196
Come on! It's freezing out here!

11:03.230 --> 11:05.465
Uh, this is the Crystal Empire.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.467
We've seen snow before.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.103
Not like this!

11:10.137 --> 11:12.205
Shining Armor: We don't
have time to argue.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.842
Princess Cadance has decided
to evacuate the city.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.109
[the crowd gasps]

11:16.143 --> 11:17.745
But the Crystalling!

11:17.778 --> 11:19.312
I don't know if we'll
ever have another

11:19.346 --> 11:21.081
Crystalling again.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.817
The Crystal Heart is shattered.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.787
[worried murmurs]

11:26.820 --> 11:28.822
It's not safe here!

11:28.856 --> 11:32.726
That's what we've been
trying to tell you!

11:32.760 --> 11:36.997
[galloping hooves]

11:37.030 --> 11:40.500
Sunburst, I know you're busy,
but did you hear what I said?

11:40.533 --> 11:43.103
Oh, I heard you,
but-but like I said,

11:43.136 --> 11:45.372
when you're an important
wizard the work just piles up.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.373
Sunburst!

11:47.440 --> 11:48.809
[sigh]

11:48.842 --> 11:52.079
Look, Starlight, I
want to help, I do.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.514
But I can't. I wish I could.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.349
What do you mean?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.251
Fixing an ancient relic?

11:58.285 --> 12:01.088
I-I can't even come close to
doing something like that!

12:01.121 --> 12:04.391
But I thought you were
an important wizard.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.393
Well, you were wrong! OK?

12:06.426 --> 12:09.897
I'm not an important wizard!
I'm not even a wizard at all!

12:09.930 --> 12:12.132
* [dramatic]

12:15.268 --> 12:17.971
[rushing wind]

12:18.005 --> 12:21.141
**

12:21.174 --> 12:22.943
I know it's hard for
you to understand,

12:22.976 --> 12:25.545
but not all of us end
up achieving greatness!

12:25.578 --> 12:29.149
What? Why wouldn't
I understand that?

12:29.182 --> 12:32.853
Really? You're the protégé of
the Princess of Friendship.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.856
I don't think she picks
just anypony for that.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.458
Technically, she's more of
a student than a protégé.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.496
Whatever. I'm sorry I'm not
the big, important wizard

12:43.530 --> 12:46.099
you were expecting.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.102
Sunburst! I don't care if
you're a wizard or not.

12:49.136 --> 12:52.439
I'm just surprised. You always
knew so much about magic.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.242
I mean, look at all these books!

12:55.275 --> 12:58.245
Yeah, well, reading
about magic is one thing,

12:58.278 --> 13:00.848
but you don't know what it
was like at Magic School,

13:00.881 --> 13:03.416
to know so much and not
be able to do any of it!

13:06.920 --> 13:09.556
Well, you don't know what it
was like to be left behind!

13:09.589 --> 13:12.059
And then getting so bitter
that you steal the cutie marks

13:12.092 --> 13:13.927
from an entire village
and then get defeated

13:13.961 --> 13:14.962
by Twilight and her friends.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.297
So you travel through
time to get back at them,

13:17.330 --> 13:19.532
but they beat you again and
teach you about friendship,

13:19.566 --> 13:22.035
but you're so terrified ponies
will find out what you did

13:22.069 --> 13:23.470
that you can't make any friends!

13:30.477 --> 13:33.013
Did you really
travel through time?

13:33.046 --> 13:36.016
See? I told you
he'd be impressed.

13:36.049 --> 13:39.086
I'm sorry we lost touch.
Maybe if I had reached out,

13:39.119 --> 13:40.954
you could have helped
me at Magic School

13:40.988 --> 13:42.422
and I could have
helped you to...

13:42.455 --> 13:44.291
Not become totally evil?

13:46.593 --> 13:49.930
[sigh] Let's just say
I know what it's like

13:49.963 --> 13:53.200
to have something you're
not exactly proud of.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.236
You showed up thinking
I was some big wizard.

13:56.269 --> 13:59.306
I'm sorry. I should
have told you the truth.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.242
It's fine. At least
we worked it all out.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.277
I think Twilight
would be proud of us.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.479
Well, if you ever want
to tell her about it,

14:06.513 --> 14:08.615
we should probably leave now!

14:08.648 --> 14:11.151
I forgot to tell you,
they're evacuating the city!

14:11.184 --> 14:13.020
You need to get to
the train station,

14:13.053 --> 14:14.354
unless you've got a spell here

14:14.387 --> 14:15.956
that will drive back
the Frozen North

14:15.989 --> 14:17.090
and fix the Crystal Heart

14:17.124 --> 14:19.059
so the baby can have
her Crystalling?

14:19.092 --> 14:21.561
The Crystalling. Of course!

14:21.594 --> 14:27.667
**

14:27.700 --> 14:32.005
[zap]

14:32.039 --> 14:34.574
[grunts]

14:34.607 --> 14:36.409
Push them back, my sister!

14:38.946 --> 14:40.513
[whistling wind]

14:40.547 --> 14:46.553
**

14:46.586 --> 14:47.654
This way!

14:47.687 --> 14:49.422
[shouts]

14:55.662 --> 14:57.597
[whoosh]

14:57.630 --> 14:58.898
[grunt]

15:01.601 --> 15:03.536
Just a little bit
further, y'all!

15:03.570 --> 15:05.005
The station's just ahead!

15:10.077 --> 15:12.379
We have to go back!

15:12.412 --> 15:14.047
I know how to stop this!

15:23.190 --> 15:27.027
Uh, I think that's everything.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.395
It looks right to me,

15:28.428 --> 15:30.263
but there's only
one way to find out.

15:32.632 --> 15:37.370
[whoosh]

15:44.211 --> 15:45.178
[shatter]

15:47.014 --> 15:50.250
The spell failed. I don't
know what else to do.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.685
An old student of
mine believes he does.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.426
The baby did this!?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.128
I tried putting it
back together with...

16:01.161 --> 16:02.595
...the Spell of Relic
Reconstitution.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.197
That won't do it.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.099
The Crystal Heart's been
around for millennia.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.069
Restoring a relic like this is
magic way beyond one spell.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.770
You'd need to combine
it with something else,

16:10.803 --> 16:13.106
something unique to
the relic itself,

16:13.140 --> 16:15.975
something that strengthens it
and provides it with power.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.013
The Crystalling!

16:20.047 --> 16:22.349
Combining that spell
with the light and love

16:22.382 --> 16:25.685
of everypony gathered for the
ceremony, together with...

16:25.718 --> 16:27.754
Somnambula's Weather Abjuration

16:27.787 --> 16:30.323
to clear away the snow and...

16:30.357 --> 16:33.426
A little Fledgling's
Forbearance for the parents.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.395
[cooing]

16:35.428 --> 16:37.730
That should curb the little
one's power fluctuations.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.766
[cooing]

16:39.799 --> 16:41.568
You must be Sunburst.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.770
Starlight said you
were a powerful wizard.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.472
Oh, I'm no wizard.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.540
Huh? What?

16:47.574 --> 16:50.110
But he studied magic
his whole life!

16:50.143 --> 16:51.578
You should see his house!

16:51.611 --> 16:53.646
And since no pony
has any better ideas,

16:53.680 --> 16:55.115
what do we have to lose?

16:59.719 --> 17:02.455
I had planned on asking
Twilight to be our Crystaller,

17:02.489 --> 17:04.757
but since it seems
like she'll be busy...

17:04.791 --> 17:06.593
[cooing]

17:06.626 --> 17:09.129
I'd be honored.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.797
Well, what are we waiting for?

17:10.830 --> 17:24.577
**

17:24.611 --> 17:25.778
[groan]

17:25.812 --> 17:36.055
**

17:36.055 --> 17:48.468
**

17:48.501 --> 17:52.472
* [majestic theme]

17:52.505 --> 17:55.408
Citizens, may I present
the newest member

17:55.442 --> 17:57.244
of the Crystal Empire!

18:02.382 --> 18:05.718
[delighted squeals]

18:05.752 --> 18:07.587
She's beautiful.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.689
Oh! It's just so moving.

18:36.949 --> 18:41.788
[whoosh]

18:41.821 --> 18:43.122
[giggle]

18:46.459 --> 18:48.628
[shouts]

18:57.404 --> 18:59.472
Best. Crystalling. Ever!

19:03.543 --> 19:07.580
For a Pony who isn't great at
magic, you did pretty well.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.648
Celestia: Indeed.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.583
I'm glad to see
you've found a way

19:10.617 --> 19:13.386
to share your unique
gift, Sunburst.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.755
You may be more of a
wizard than you think.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.662
You would not believe
the crazy weather

19:22.695 --> 19:24.364
that delayed our train!

19:24.397 --> 19:25.932
Came out of nowhere!

19:25.965 --> 19:29.436
But it was all worth it to see
this peaceful little angel.

19:29.469 --> 19:33.240
Aww so sweet, come
to your grandmare.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.974
[giggle]

19:35.007 --> 19:37.810
Yeah. Peaceful now, anyway.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.447
I suppose that spell
really did the trick.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.749
[starting to sneeze]

19:42.782 --> 19:44.617
Aaaah!

19:44.651 --> 19:46.286
Achoo!

19:50.623 --> 19:52.792
We have Sunburst
to thank for that.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.862
I hope he takes his role
as Crystaller seriously.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.998
Something tells me the baby
will need a pony like him

19:59.031 --> 20:01.401
to look to for magical advice.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.236
Cadance, darling,
aren't we going to name

20:03.270 --> 20:05.438
the poor little dear or
are we going to spend

20:05.472 --> 20:08.475
the entire visit just
calling her "the baby?"

20:08.508 --> 20:11.778
We were thinking, Flurry Heart.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.946
You know, to remember
the occasion.

20:13.980 --> 20:17.450
Oh goodness! How
could anypony forget?

20:17.484 --> 20:18.851
I think it's lovely.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.719
[kiss]

20:19.752 --> 20:20.720
[laugh]

20:22.655 --> 20:24.691
Well, I think you're
the Crystal Empire's

20:24.724 --> 20:28.561
big, important wizard,
whether you like it or not.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.730
I don't know if I'll have
time for any wizarding.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.533
I'm a Crystaller now.
That's a big responsibility.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.503
I can't think of
anypony more qualified.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.272
Just promise you'll
stay in touch?

20:39.306 --> 20:41.274
Like I'd ever lose touch
with my oldest friend.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.848
What's wrong, Twilight?

20:48.881 --> 20:50.550
I don't know, Spike.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.453
I think I have a lot to
learn about being a teacher.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.356
What are you talking about?
Your lesson went perfectly.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.024
Starlight and Sunburst
got over their past

20:58.057 --> 20:59.426
and rekindled their friendship.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.893
No thanks to me.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.563
I know a lot happened; I
just wish I could have given

21:03.596 --> 21:05.565
my pupil the attention
she deserves.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.970
Well, I know she needed to
be put on the right path,

21:11.003 --> 21:13.340
but giving her the space
to make her own decisions

21:13.373 --> 21:14.474
worked pretty well.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.943
Isn't that how
Celestia taught you?

21:16.976 --> 21:21.614
You know, I never thought
about it, but I guess it is.

21:21.648 --> 21:24.551
Maybe you're a better
teacher than you thought.

21:24.584 --> 21:29.889
