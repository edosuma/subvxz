00:10.618 --> 00:14.664
(Frasier) 'I just opened up the pages of
"Seattle" magazine and there she was.'

00:14.831 --> 00:19.794
Oh, my! Who is this fresh angel?
Madeline Marshall?

00:19.961 --> 00:23.631
Would you be so good
as to have dinner with me tonight?

00:23.798 --> 00:27.510
I was wondering about us
going away for the weekend.

00:27.677 --> 00:29.345
I'm in love.

00:29.512 --> 00:34.017
'So off I flew to Bora Bora,
and did I receive the shock of my life?'

00:34.183 --> 00:37.228
(Beckons seductively) Frasier.

00:42.483 --> 00:45.236
- Oh, my God!
- Frasier?

00:47.655 --> 00:49.949
Oh, my God!

00:54.996 --> 00:59.542
- Lilith, what are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.

00:59.709 --> 01:03.171
- (Madeline) Is everything all right?
- Yes...

01:03.337 --> 01:05.923
Come out and join us, Madeline.

01:06.090 --> 01:08.926
Are you here with someone?

01:09.093 --> 01:11.971
Yes. He's snorkelling at the moment.

01:12.805 --> 01:14.849
- Anyone I know?
- Sam Malone.

01:15.016 --> 01:16.517
Sam?

01:18.269 --> 01:22.690
- Just kidding.
- Why did you bring him here?

01:23.774 --> 01:28.279
It was spectacular five years ago
when you brought me.

01:28.446 --> 01:32.992
But this was our place.
How could you bring someone else?

01:35.494 --> 01:38.330
Lilith, I'd like you to meet
Madeline Marshall.

01:38.497 --> 01:41.792
How's this for a hoot?
This is my ex-wife, Lilith.

01:41.959 --> 01:44.753
- Your ex-wife is here?
- Yes.

01:45.754 --> 01:48.966
What a shame, too:
no papers to be signed.

01:50.593 --> 01:54.388
- So you're here with someone?
- Why does everyone keep asking that?

01:54.555 --> 01:57.141
Here he comes now. Brian?

01:57.641 --> 02:01.895
Dr Brian Patchett, I'd like you
to meet Madeline Marshall

02:02.104 --> 02:04.398
and Dr Frasier Crane.

02:04.565 --> 02:08.443
- Your ex-husband? You're joking.
- No, God is.

02:09.402 --> 02:11.655
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.

02:11.822 --> 02:14.658
Brian is a seismologist at MIT.

02:14.825 --> 02:19.663
Perfect, Brian being a seismologist
and you having so many faults.

02:24.585 --> 02:26.920
Lilith, you're laughing!

02:27.087 --> 02:30.090
I laugh a lot these days,
thanks to Brian.

02:30.257 --> 02:35.721
Madeline is just hilarious. She also
designs her own line of sportswear.

02:35.887 --> 02:38.432
I don't think I've ever worn sportswear.

02:39.766 --> 02:41.852
So, how long are you staying?

02:42.019 --> 02:44.312
Until Tuesday.

02:44.479 --> 02:46.982
We're here till Wednesday.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.578 --> 03:02.122
This has the potential
to be very awkward.

03:02.289 --> 03:06.501
Why don't we defuse the situation
by having cocktails later?

03:06.668 --> 03:09.671
- Let's have dinner.
- Wonderful idea!

03:09.838 --> 03:12.716
- Let's meet in the Tiki room at six.
- Great.

03:12.882 --> 03:16.636
Looking forward to it.
A wonderful way to start out

03:16.803 --> 03:20.056
what promises to be a great week.

03:26.646 --> 03:30.483
- You see how Mr Perfect rubbed it in?
- Relax.

03:30.650 --> 03:35.280
Climbing a tree to get a coconut
when there were three on the ground!

03:36.656 --> 03:40.326
Would you stop obsessing?
Come here.

03:41.536 --> 03:43.580
OK.

03:49.085 --> 03:51.671
- Hold it. What's that?
- What?

03:51.838 --> 03:54.549
Lilith is making love.

03:56.175 --> 03:58.803
- I don't hear a thing.
- Exactly!

04:03.683 --> 04:07.395
Would you just concentrate on me,
please?

04:07.562 --> 04:12.817
You're right. It's not like in college
when that went on in the next room

04:12.984 --> 04:17.071
and I was all alone
with my Henry Miller collection.

04:18.029 --> 04:23.369
I've just got to block it out of my mind,
focus on the task at hand.

04:24.036 --> 04:27.206
Oh, that's sexy.

04:29.250 --> 04:32.128
You're right. Forgive me.

04:33.629 --> 04:36.716
You want sexy? I'll show you sexy.

04:42.763 --> 04:45.266
- I feel dirty.
- Good.

04:46.267 --> 04:49.353
No, I mean sandy,
from sitting on the beach.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.689
Just let me take a shower.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.441
OK. Don't be long.

04:54.608 --> 04:58.696
Then I'll make you forget
you were ever married to Lilith.

04:58.862 --> 05:03.409
That's never happened before
without a prescription.

05:09.623 --> 05:12.209
Oh, yeah.

05:12.376 --> 05:14.628
Oh, yeah!

05:21.426 --> 05:23.387
Oh, yeah.

05:26.098 --> 05:29.142
Ohh!
It's never been like this before!

05:30.394 --> 05:32.229
Never!

05:33.480 --> 05:37.818
Nothing! Damn her!
She can give as good as she gets!

05:39.403 --> 05:41.446
Oh, yeah.

05:42.155 --> 05:45.742
Oh, yeah!
Ohh! Oh, Mama!

05:46.743 --> 05:50.539
Oh, God! You are so hot!
I am burning up!

05:50.747 --> 05:53.917
That's it! That's it! Yes!

05:54.084 --> 05:56.378
Yes! Oh, my God, yes!

05:56.545 --> 05:59.548
Keep it up, baby!
Oh, you're killing me!

05:59.714 --> 06:03.093
Oh, God, you're an animal!
Yes! Yes!

06:10.976 --> 06:13.019
Obviously you don't need me.

06:18.400 --> 06:23.071
Before we go to Chopper Dave
for a traffic report,

06:23.238 --> 06:26.741
I'd like to send this message
to Madeline M.

06:26.908 --> 06:33.331
I'm sure your gentleman would love
an opportunity to explain his behaviour,

06:33.498 --> 06:37.043
but you left the island
before he had a chance...

06:38.878 --> 06:42.966
...and you won't return his calls
or answer his notes.

06:44.092 --> 06:48.012
We all know how hard it is
to find love in this world

06:48.179 --> 06:52.433
and what a tragedy it is
to let it slip through our fingers.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.478
I think he really cares about you.

06:56.521 --> 07:00.566
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
We'll be back in a moment.

07:00.733 --> 07:03.986
- You were wonderful!
- You think she'll call?

07:04.153 --> 07:07.740
- lf she doesn't, she has no heart.
- Thank you, Roz.

07:07.907 --> 07:12.912
I almost forgot. This bill came
for you from your hotel in Bora Bora.

07:13.788 --> 07:17.291
I guess they had to charge me
for the whole week.

07:17.458 --> 07:20.670
No, that's for the bed you trashed.

07:20.836 --> 07:23.130
$2,500 for bamboo?

07:26.425 --> 07:30.680
Hello? This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Roz, whom do we have next?

07:30.846 --> 07:33.849
We have Vic from Seattle
on line three.

07:34.016 --> 07:38.396
- Hello, Vic. I'm listening.
- (Vic) 'Hi. Thanks for taking my call.

07:38.562 --> 07:41.857
- 'I'm a little nervous.'
- Just relax, Vic.

07:42.024 --> 07:45.361
- I'm listening.
- 'I have a problem with women.'

07:45.528 --> 07:48.656
Frasier, Madeline's on line one.

07:48.823 --> 07:50.866
'Dr Crane?'

07:51.033 --> 07:53.619
Vic, something's come up
in the booth.

07:53.786 --> 07:57.248
I'll have to turn you over
to my capable producer.

07:59.833 --> 08:03.045
Madeline, hi! Thanks for calling.

08:03.212 --> 08:05.923
No, it's OK. I'm off the air now.

08:06.924 --> 08:09.593
So, Vic, what's your problem
with women?

08:09.760 --> 08:13.472
'I don't know. I have a good job,
a good personality, I think.

08:13.639 --> 08:18.394
'I made more money as a model,
but I'm doing OK at the law firm.'

08:18.560 --> 08:20.729
Tell me more.

08:24.566 --> 08:27.861
Maris is thrilled
you're seeing the ballet.

08:28.028 --> 08:30.113
- We're delighted.
- Yeah.

08:31.031 --> 08:34.826
When I was younger,
I dreamed of being a ballerina.

08:34.993 --> 08:39.206
So did Maris. But she could
never get her weight up.

08:42.042 --> 08:47.422
That's why I bought this walk-on part
at the fundraiser as a gift for Maris.

08:47.589 --> 08:52.552
- So Maris is going to be a ballerina?
- It's non-dancing, but a key role.

08:52.719 --> 08:57.307
She plays Ulrich,
the hunchbacked drawbridge operator.

08:58.934 --> 09:01.269
I hope we can pick her out.

09:03.480 --> 09:08.485
- What are you still doing here?
- We'll be gone before she gets here.

09:08.652 --> 09:11.446
- You don't want to be late.
- I do.

09:11.613 --> 09:16.284
With those ballet guys in tight pants,
I don't know where to look.

09:16.451 --> 09:20.497
That reminds me.
I've got to bring my binoculars.

09:20.664 --> 09:24.376
- Will you just get out of here?
- Frasier, relax.

09:24.542 --> 09:28.838
This is my last chance.
It serves me right after Bora Bora.

09:29.005 --> 09:31.674
You're being too hard on yourself.

09:31.841 --> 09:34.594
How were you to know
Lilith was there?

09:34.761 --> 09:40.141
Aside from the seas starting to churn
and all the birds taking flight.

09:41.768 --> 09:45.146
Don't worry.
Miss Marshall will forgive you.

09:45.313 --> 09:49.567
Women appreciate a man
who's sensitive enough to try again.

09:49.734 --> 09:52.403
That's why they call us "the fair sex".

09:52.570 --> 09:56.950
All right, then, let's go see
some leaping Russian stags.

09:58.534 --> 10:01.871
- Oh, hi, Maddie!
- Hello.

10:02.038 --> 10:04.582
- We were just leaving.
- Come in.

10:04.749 --> 10:09.545
You two kids take your time.
We'll be out all evening.

10:09.712 --> 10:14.675
You know how it is: first the ballet,
then the inevitable discussion.

10:22.808 --> 10:26.437
- That was a little awkward, huh?
- So is this.

10:27.688 --> 10:31.525
I'd better launch into my little speech

10:31.692 --> 10:34.445
to explain
why I behaved the way I did.

10:34.612 --> 10:38.032
No, I'll tell you
how I've got it worked out:

10:38.199 --> 10:42.745
when you saw Lilith, you wanted
to leave, but I wouldn't let you.

10:42.912 --> 10:47.041
You said you couldn't handle it
and, by God, you were right.

10:49.293 --> 10:52.797
You panicked
and your panic took a bad turn.

10:52.963 --> 10:55.049
A spectacularly bad turn.

10:55.216 --> 11:00.137
That's how I've got it worked out.
It's fragile, so don't mess with it.

11:01.180 --> 11:06.143
So, why don't you mix up a pitcher
of Mai Tais and give me a kiss?

11:06.310 --> 11:09.355
I'll let you guess which I want first.

11:11.941 --> 11:14.276
Guess again.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.497
Delicious. I love mangoes.

11:26.663 --> 11:30.709
We never got round to sampling them
on the islands.

11:30.876 --> 11:34.630
- So I thought we should now.
- Good thinking.

11:39.092 --> 11:43.180
There's something else
we never got around to in Bora Bora.

11:43.347 --> 11:45.849
You got around to it. I just watched.

11:51.438 --> 11:55.609
How about a little
audience participation this time?

12:01.531 --> 12:03.575
Frasier, wait.

12:03.742 --> 12:06.828
I want this as much as you,
but I need to talk to you first.

12:06.995 --> 12:08.830
What?

12:08.997 --> 12:14.336
I thought I was comfortable with this
and wouldn't have to bring it up.

12:15.629 --> 12:18.715
I was involved
with a divorced man before.

12:18.882 --> 12:23.428
Just when I was falling for him,
he reconciled with his ex-wife.

12:23.595 --> 12:25.931
I can't go through that again.

12:27.349 --> 12:32.812
It's all right, Madeline. Trust me.
Lilith and I are completely finished.

12:32.979 --> 12:35.648
She lives on the other side
of the country.

12:35.815 --> 12:38.818
Except in matters of our son,
we don't have contact.

12:39.944 --> 12:42.614
That's all I wanted to hear.

12:53.333 --> 12:56.753
Well, what's your name, little fellow?

13:05.094 --> 13:07.764
You promise you won't laugh?

13:17.231 --> 13:22.195
The dog... His name is Eddie.

13:23.654 --> 13:28.117
Come on. Pardon me while I put him
back where he belongs.

13:28.284 --> 13:30.786
I'll be waiting.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.878
(Door knocks)

13:47.011 --> 13:49.055
Oh, God!

13:49.889 --> 13:53.434
It's nice to see you, too.
Is Frasier here?

13:53.601 --> 13:57.646
- Don't you live in Boston?
- I'm here on a layover.

13:57.813 --> 14:02.776
And, judging by Frasier's trademark
mangoes on a stick, so are you.

14:08.282 --> 14:11.577
lf you like, I can come back
in ten minutes.

14:15.456 --> 14:19.668
- That won't be necessary.
- I apologise for being inopportune.

14:19.835 --> 14:22.963
We've agreed
to make time for each other

14:23.130 --> 14:26.008
if we have something
urgent to discuss.

14:26.884 --> 14:29.094
Take all the time you need.

14:30.012 --> 14:33.807
This whole thing's
just a little too complicated for me.

15:02.711 --> 15:05.172
Put down that mango, my dear.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.216
It's time you tasted the forbidden fruit.

15:17.350 --> 15:22.355
- Lilith! What are you doing here?
- I have something urgent to discuss.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.567
What have you done with Madeline?

15:26.484 --> 15:30.947
She was surprised to see me and left.
I hope you're not angry.

15:31.114 --> 15:34.659
Angry?
What do I have to be angry about?

15:34.826 --> 15:39.831
I carve out a slice of happiness
for myself and you obliterate it.

15:39.998 --> 15:44.836
I'd drive a stake through your heart,
but I don't think it could kill you.

15:50.633 --> 15:55.013
- Brian asked me to marry him.
- What?

15:56.681 --> 16:00.310
He wants to stop in Las Vegas
on our way home.

16:01.728 --> 16:05.064
- You're getting married?
- Yes.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.066
Well...

16:07.984 --> 16:09.819
So am I.

16:13.072 --> 16:16.784
- Really?
- Yes, yes, to Madeline.

16:16.951 --> 16:21.122
She seemed in an awful hurry
for someone who's getting married.

16:21.289 --> 16:23.541
She had to buy a dress.

16:26.002 --> 16:28.379
Oh, God, what am I doing?

16:29.422 --> 16:34.010
- I'm not getting married.
- Wow, you really had me going.

16:36.262 --> 16:39.181
Frasier,
I don't want to disrupt anything.

16:39.348 --> 16:41.893
I just came to get your blessing.

16:42.977 --> 16:45.146
I could have given it over the phone.

16:46.063 --> 16:49.400
- Must you be so churlish?
- I think I'm entitled.

16:49.567 --> 16:53.863
The one comfort in being divorced
is that you're both losers.

16:54.030 --> 16:58.576
Eventually the time comes when
one person is the first to move on.

16:58.743 --> 17:01.537
Quite frankly,
I'd hoped it would be me.

17:02.747 --> 17:05.833
Well, I'd hoped it would be me,
and it was.

17:07.585 --> 17:10.337
But I'd like to think that,
the other way around,

17:10.503 --> 17:12.882
I would have been happy for you.

17:16.218 --> 17:18.596
lf you love him, I am happy for you.

17:18.762 --> 17:23.851
I do. Brian has been a dutiful suitor
and I'm convinced,

17:24.018 --> 17:28.105
to within an acceptable margin
of error, that he loves me.

17:33.902 --> 17:36.572
- Does Frederick like him?
- Yes.

17:36.739 --> 17:39.825
- Oh.
- Oh, Frasier.

17:39.992 --> 17:44.997
Brian could never take your place
that way. You're Frederick's father.

17:49.126 --> 17:51.169
Congratulations.

17:54.590 --> 17:57.259
Well, it looks like they made up.

18:07.102 --> 18:10.689
- Hello, everyone.
- Lilith, what a pleasant surprise!

18:10.856 --> 18:12.774
How was Bora Bora?

18:14.776 --> 18:17.571
Never seen you looking so tan.

18:21.199 --> 18:24.995
My God,
what does she look like in winter?

18:25.162 --> 18:29.624
We have some happy news.
Lilith is going to be married again.

18:30.959 --> 18:33.461
- To who?
- Someone else.

18:33.628 --> 18:37.507
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!

18:37.716 --> 18:39.551
Wonderful!

18:43.596 --> 18:45.432
Oh. Yes.

18:45.598 --> 18:48.852
- Wonderful. When?
- Tomorrow in Las Vegas.

18:49.018 --> 18:52.731
Oh, Lilith!
How delightfully kitschy.

18:52.897 --> 18:55.942
You're poking fun at the institution

18:56.109 --> 19:00.530
by getting married
in the tackiest place possible.

19:03.449 --> 19:06.077
Brian's family lives in Las Vegas.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.747
Well, isn't that convenient?

19:10.873 --> 19:14.168
You'll have someone
to show you the museums.

19:23.970 --> 19:28.057
- It was lovely seeing you again.
- I'll walk you out.

19:35.022 --> 19:38.151
I hope you haven't found this
too unsettling.

19:38.317 --> 19:43.239
No, no. It's actually good
that you're getting remarried.

19:43.406 --> 19:47.285
We could have kept wondering
if we'd made a mistake,

19:47.451 --> 19:49.829
if we should have worked it out.

19:49.996 --> 19:54.417
Was it me? Was it you?
Was it us? Was it you?

19:56.460 --> 20:00.840
- Now we can move on.
- What's next for you?

20:01.006 --> 20:04.218
I'll try to smooth things over
with Madeline.

20:04.427 --> 20:07.304
Try very hard. She seems worth it.

20:08.305 --> 20:13.060
She'll need convincing.
I could try asking her back to Bora Bora.

20:13.269 --> 20:18.524
I'll lay on the whole package:
buy the tickets, pay for the hotel,

20:18.691 --> 20:23.612
get a limo - champagne, caviar,
the whole nine yards.

20:23.779 --> 20:26.991
I'll sweep her off her feet
and into my bed.

20:28.284 --> 20:30.953
I do own it, you know.

20:35.791 --> 20:39.545
- Would you like to kiss the bride?
- My pleasure.

20:42.631 --> 20:45.717
- You're really happy for me?
- Of course.

20:45.884 --> 20:49.012
You'll understand
if I don't jump up and down.

20:49.179 --> 20:51.974
Yes. I've already seen that.

21:12.244 --> 21:16.206
(Madeline) Why don't we pick up
where we left off, Frasier?

21:20.460 --> 21:24.214
- Oh, my God.
- Frasier?

21:24.423 --> 21:26.758
Oh, my God!

21:36.351 --> 21:38.687
Oh. Oh, my...

21:38.853 --> 21:42.983
Oh, God, I just had
the most frightening dream!

21:43.149 --> 21:45.402
Thank God I'm here with you!

21:49.322 --> 21:51.658
We have all week
to analyse your dream.

21:51.825 --> 21:54.411
Right now,
there's a huge bug in the shower.

22:09.425 --> 22:14.931
# Hey baby, I hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:15.098 --> 22:16.474
# Quite stylish!

22:16.641 --> 22:23.564
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:23.731 --> 22:29.529
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:29.696 --> 22:31.823
# They're calling again #

22:31.989 --> 22:35.034
Frasier has left the building.

22:36.305 --> 22:42.214
