WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:03.860
One of the biggest assets
that we've ever had.

00:03.896 --> 00:05.762
I need to know
if I can trust you.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.365
That goes both ways. Your
vaudevillian is in love with aurora.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.167
<i>Where is it you're from?
The moon.</i>

00:11.203 --> 00:14.371
Of course. Yeah, I should have
known they'd invade there too.

00:14.406 --> 00:17.607
Sharpshooter miri was recently
arrested for shooting soldiers.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.843
From a bell tower.
Tell me where she is.

00:19.878 --> 00:22.857
You're gonna break her out on your own? Get
yourself killed? I'm not gonna let you do that.

00:22.881 --> 00:26.616
<i>I have to see her. I have to.
We didn't get to say goodbye.</i>

00:26.652 --> 00:28.318
Klaus! Krystina.

00:30.689 --> 00:32.522
Did the frommer boy chicken out?

00:32.558 --> 00:35.191
<i>No, I shot him. Is she alright?</i>

00:35.227 --> 00:37.727
<i>She is at the hotel renier.
She was escorted.</i>

00:37.763 --> 00:40.130
By an ss officer.
He's her father.

00:40.165 --> 00:43.166
How close is sabina with her father?
Very close.

00:43.201 --> 00:45.969
<i>Close enough, she'd tell him secrets?
Was there something else.</i>

00:46.004 --> 00:49.139
You wanted to tell me? Please,

00:49.174 --> 00:50.874
You can tell your father.

00:50.909 --> 00:54.644
Papa, it's serious.
It's about france.

01:12.164 --> 01:14.130
Don't forget your papers!

01:14.166 --> 01:15.665
Is it set?

01:15.701 --> 01:18.602
Set. Sabine?

01:18.637 --> 01:20.837
She's not in the restaurant,
and the concierge.

01:20.872 --> 01:23.273
Hasn't seen her leave.

01:23.308 --> 01:25.609
What? You really think
she'd give up her husband?

01:25.644 --> 01:27.611
I don't think
she wants him killed,

01:27.646 --> 01:29.713
But I don't think
she thinks ahead.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.384
<i>You're sure about this?</i>

01:34.419 --> 01:37.020
I'm so sorry.
I knew you would be shocked.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.922
You're absolutely sure
you want to leave him?

01:38.957 --> 01:42.158
Franz is not the man
I thought he was. I...

01:42.194 --> 01:44.928
I don't love him. I see.

01:47.866 --> 01:51.001
I want to go back to berlin
with you. I want to go home.

01:55.207 --> 01:57.474
Sabine, you have
a very special responsibility.

01:57.509 --> 01:59.743
You know what your country.

01:59.778 --> 02:02.412
Children, kitchen, church.

02:02.447 --> 02:04.381
And a husband needs
a wife by his side.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.583
Papa, please, listen to me.

02:06.618 --> 02:09.619
There is nothing worse.

02:09.655 --> 02:11.821
For a couple
than to lose a child,

02:11.857 --> 02:14.557
But you must be strong
and not always.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.559
Think of yourself.
You think you understand,

02:16.595 --> 02:18.795
But you don't.
It's not that simple.

02:18.830 --> 02:20.797
I have to leave him
and come back home.

02:20.832 --> 02:22.565
What's not that simple?

02:22.601 --> 02:25.568
I can't stay in paris. Come in!

02:25.604 --> 02:27.570
If you knew why,
you'd understand.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.272
About franz. For you.

02:29.307 --> 02:32.308
Thank you.
Are you even listening?

02:32.344 --> 02:34.644
I have to make a phone call,

02:34.680 --> 02:37.313
But would it be all right
if we talked a bit later?

02:37.349 --> 02:39.282
Yes, if you're not too busy.

02:39.317 --> 02:41.685
Good girl. Now, I will see you.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.787
At franz's celebration. I know.

02:43.822 --> 02:46.823
I don't want to come either.
But it's a big day for him.

02:46.858 --> 02:48.992
Everyone will be there,
so be sure.

02:49.027 --> 02:51.528
To look your best.
We'll talk more later.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.507
<i>The entire nazi machine,
everything...</i>

03:04.543 --> 03:06.643
Planes, tanks, troops...
They all run on oil.

03:06.678 --> 03:09.345
If we cripple the supply,
it makes the war smaller.

03:09.381 --> 03:11.347
We end it sooner.
Lives are saved on both sides.

03:11.383 --> 03:13.950
I need to be back.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.119
5 o'clock. Yes, I know.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.166
The location of the refineries
is highly classified.

03:18.190 --> 03:21.291
Your father-in-law is one
of the few people who knows.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.460
Where they all are.
Don't socialize with the man.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.462
What's your relationship
with him?

03:25.497 --> 03:28.331
Complicated. How so?

03:28.366 --> 03:30.333
He knows I only joined
the ss because,

03:30.368 --> 03:33.002
As his future son in-law,
there was no other choice.

03:33.038 --> 03:35.905
You don't share his beliefs?
I don't.

03:35.941 --> 03:38.241
If he heard you were
a traitor...

03:39.711 --> 03:41.678
Sometimes, I think
he'd insist on leading.

03:41.713 --> 03:43.680
The firing squad personally.

03:43.715 --> 03:47.517
I've got her.

03:56.795 --> 03:58.962
Hello, sabine.

03:58.997 --> 04:01.030
We need to talk.

04:01.066 --> 04:04.701
Did franz send you?
No, he didn't send me.

04:04.736 --> 04:07.370
Where's the gun?
There's no need for that.

04:10.342 --> 04:12.909
I'll talk,
but don't you dare touch me.

04:22.154 --> 04:24.187
She must be inside that church.

04:26.625 --> 04:29.159
Let's go around the back,
see if there's another way in.

04:29.194 --> 04:31.427
Even if we get past the guards,

04:31.463 --> 04:34.542
Even if we do get her out of there, how far
do you think we'll get without a vehicle?

04:34.566 --> 04:36.966
The guards won't need theirs
if they're dead.

04:37.002 --> 04:38.968
They have automatic weapons.

04:39.004 --> 04:41.271
I'm getting miri out of there.
Are you with me or not?

04:41.306 --> 04:43.206
Yeah, but only if
we have a solid plan.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.444
This is a place of god,
and I have a service to do.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.747
Take your business
somewhere else!

04:50.782 --> 04:53.249
Go away.

04:55.153 --> 04:58.154
If we can't get inside,
maybe there's someone who can.

05:03.662 --> 05:05.662
Why don't we sit down?

05:12.137 --> 05:15.605
I see we have company.
He's here to protect me.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.941
In case you told your father
anything that might.

05:17.976 --> 05:20.043
Put us at risk.

05:20.078 --> 05:22.045
Did you?

05:22.080 --> 05:24.113
Did I tell my father
about the spies.

05:24.149 --> 05:26.783
Who pretend to be my friends,
who come to my home,

05:26.818 --> 05:28.852
And follow me in the streets?

05:28.887 --> 05:30.954
Not yet.

05:30.989 --> 05:32.989
That's good.

05:34.726 --> 05:36.793
Last week, we were planning
to run away to spain.

05:36.828 --> 05:38.461
After he chased you
out of my house,

05:38.496 --> 05:40.964
I thought... Good.

05:40.999 --> 05:42.844
Maybe we had a chance to leave
all this business behind.

05:42.868 --> 05:45.501
And start again.
A few days later,

05:45.537 --> 05:47.737
He comes home,
"sabine, I've just met.

05:47.772 --> 05:50.006
With them. I'm going to help."
another decision.

05:50.041 --> 05:52.008
Without even thinking to ask.
I understand.

05:52.043 --> 05:55.278
That you're angry.
I would feel the same way.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.380
But he thought it would be...

05:57.415 --> 06:00.016
He thought it would be safer
for you not to know.

06:00.051 --> 06:02.018
He was trying to protect you.

06:02.053 --> 06:04.320
I'm not some porcelain doll.
Of course not.

06:04.356 --> 06:06.789
And that's why
we need your help.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.825
Franz, he needs your help.

06:08.860 --> 06:12.228
I don't know who franz is.
Please, just come with me.

06:12.264 --> 06:14.497
I'm done taking orders.
From you, from franz.

06:14.532 --> 06:16.510
And you can tell him I won't
come to his party either!

06:16.534 --> 06:18.568
What party? For his promotion.

06:18.603 --> 06:20.503
Everyone will be there.

06:20.538 --> 06:22.505
My father wants me
to look pretty.

06:22.540 --> 06:25.275
And play the happy wife.
If he only knew.

06:25.310 --> 06:28.011
Listen, I don't want
to tell you what to do...

06:28.046 --> 06:29.545
Then don't! Shh-shh.

06:29.581 --> 06:31.748
I'm done with franz
and just because I haven't told.

06:31.783 --> 06:34.217
My father doesn't mean I won't.

06:34.252 --> 06:36.819
Now, leave me alone.
Sabine! Sabine!

06:36.855 --> 06:40.223
You have the power to make a
choice... I told you not to touch me!

06:40.258 --> 06:42.325
You know he's gonna
get shot, that's the law!

06:42.360 --> 06:44.394
You don't know who
my father is. There is no law.

06:44.429 --> 06:46.240
He can have franz exiled...
Might be a little bit naive.

06:46.264 --> 06:48.464
There you go again. I'm a child!

06:48.500 --> 06:51.901
Let me go! Or are you gonna
just shoot me?!

06:51.937 --> 06:54.037
Your husband loves you
very much. You know that?

06:54.072 --> 06:56.105
Call the police!
She's a thief! They have a gun!

06:56.141 --> 06:57.907
My goodness!

06:57.943 --> 07:01.411
Please. Stay away!

07:09.287 --> 07:11.287
Volatile. Uncooperative.

07:11.323 --> 07:15.258
We'll need to keep our distance.
But we did get the recording.

07:15.293 --> 07:17.393
Sabine had no idea.

07:17.429 --> 07:19.896
So we got what we need?
Yeah, loud and clear.

07:19.931 --> 07:22.265
She knows her husband
is working with the allies,

07:22.300 --> 07:24.901
But she's keeping a secret.
Good.

07:24.936 --> 07:26.903
For now.

07:26.938 --> 07:29.639
This technically makes her
a traitor too.

07:29.674 --> 07:31.641
Let's hope
we don't need to use it.

07:31.676 --> 07:35.211
He's got to get back. Sir...

07:35.246 --> 07:38.081
There's a party this evening.
Faber is being promoted and.

07:38.116 --> 07:40.294
Sabine says that everyone will
be there, including her father.

07:40.318 --> 07:42.919
And I presume
she's not going to be there.

07:42.954 --> 07:44.921
But all the top brass are.

07:44.956 --> 07:47.056
We may not get a chance
like this again.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.258
We were thinking
that we could mingle, listen.

07:49.294 --> 07:51.260
Plant some false intel.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.730
Schmidt's gonna be there?
That's right.

07:53.765 --> 07:57.467
What are you thinking?

07:57.502 --> 07:59.435
Does helene bauer
know how to dance?

07:59.471 --> 08:02.739
Of course she does.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.742
If sabine decided to talk,

08:05.777 --> 08:07.510
You could be
walking into a trap.

08:07.545 --> 08:10.346
If the party's on,
she hasn't talked.

08:10.382 --> 08:13.783
Good point. Let's see if we
can get you on the guest list.

08:13.818 --> 08:16.085
Make schmidt your priority.

08:18.857 --> 08:21.457
How is she? She's not in danger.

08:21.493 --> 08:24.927
She hasn't said anything incriminating
to her father. You're safe to go.

08:24.963 --> 08:29.165
Did she say
if she's coming home?

08:29.200 --> 08:31.167
Only that she won't be attending.

08:31.202 --> 08:33.269
Your celebration tonight.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.270
I need you to put.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.273
Helene bauer.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.008
<i>And sturmbannfuhrer
karl reimann.</i>

08:39.044 --> 08:41.889
Absolutely not. It's a private function;
It will bring unwanted attention.

08:41.913 --> 08:43.880
You won't be compromised.
I said no.

08:43.914 --> 08:47.016
This is what a double-agent relationship
looks like. Are you in or not?

08:48.953 --> 08:50.853
It is in your interest.

08:50.889 --> 08:52.855
That I maintain credibility
with my superiors?

08:52.891 --> 08:54.791
Correct. My agent in canada.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.859
Has not reported in
since the failed operation.

08:56.895 --> 08:59.228
But if he has been captured.

08:59.264 --> 09:01.384
And is in your custody,
it would reflect poorly on me.

09:03.234 --> 09:05.201
I know you would never
release him.

09:05.236 --> 09:08.538
That's right.
I need him terminated.

09:08.573 --> 09:11.574
An honorable death.
Consider it done.

09:11.609 --> 09:14.610
Tonight, your agents.

09:14.646 --> 09:16.746
Can listen and observe
from a discreet distance.

09:16.781 --> 09:19.549
I will make introductions
of my choosing.

09:19.584 --> 09:21.684
Understood.

09:24.556 --> 09:26.656
Good luck with the call.

09:45.009 --> 09:48.044
Excuse me, father.

09:48.079 --> 09:50.413
Can I help you?

09:50.448 --> 09:52.849
The people they're holding
inside the church...

09:52.884 --> 09:55.518
Yes? My friend is one of them.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.821
I want her to know she has a friend
on the outside. Can you help me?

10:01.126 --> 10:04.794
Bread for the prisoners.

10:04.829 --> 10:06.863
Bread for the prisoners.

10:12.971 --> 10:15.037
Thank you.

10:17.008 --> 10:19.008
Thank you, father.

10:19.043 --> 10:21.377
Are you the "girl
from the moon"?

10:34.659 --> 10:37.593
I assume you acquired your job
at the royal care society.

10:37.629 --> 10:39.729
Through your sympathizer
contacts. Who are they?

10:39.764 --> 10:43.266
We're already questioning
your swastika club associate.

10:43.301 --> 10:46.235
At the bar, as well as the other
patrons. They're mostly idiots.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.071
But you also have
some sophisticated colleagues.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.073
Who provided you
with the compact explosive.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.075
You gave klaus?

10:53.111 --> 10:56.779
Any other questions?
Maybe I should make a list.

10:56.814 --> 10:59.182
The sooner you answer
my questions, the sooner.

10:59.217 --> 11:01.317
You get some circulation
back in your arms.

11:01.352 --> 11:05.087
Is that how this works? I just
tell you what you want to know?

11:05.123 --> 11:07.256
They must have run out.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.992
Of manpower to promote you
to sergeant.

11:10.028 --> 11:12.528
If you were better at
your job, you wouldn't be here.

11:12.564 --> 11:14.608
I'm impressed klaus frommer
was able to get the bomb.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.067
Past your security.
Kid was a little jumpy.

11:19.904 --> 11:22.171
He didn't need to die.
You manipulated him.

11:22.207 --> 11:25.241
You seem to care a lot
about a german you killed.

11:28.179 --> 11:30.179
He was your first, wasn't he?

11:30.215 --> 11:33.983
And they sent you in
to talk to me.

11:34.018 --> 11:37.153
Bad strategy to send
an emotional officer.

11:37.188 --> 11:39.989
Into a room with a subject.
That's it.

11:40.024 --> 11:42.325
I didn't want
to have to do this.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.702
You ok?

11:52.737 --> 11:54.804
I'm ok.

12:09.921 --> 12:11.687
Good luck.

12:31.109 --> 12:33.109
<i>Frau helene bauer.</i>

12:33.144 --> 12:35.911
<i>And sturmbannfuhrer
karl reimann.</i>

13:16.354 --> 13:18.454
It was a pleasure.
A pleasure to see you again.

13:21.626 --> 13:24.293
My warmest
congratulations, franz.

13:26.531 --> 13:28.497
Thank you for including us,

13:28.533 --> 13:31.334
<i>Herr brigadefuhrer.</i>

13:33.638 --> 13:35.705
I'm delighted
you both could make it.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.291
A half hour ago.
Rumour or confirmed?

13:46.326 --> 13:49.171
I thought jacques rigaud was still in
exile in london with general de gaulle.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.840
Two sources confirmed
he has landed on the coast.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.830
He's been making his way
toward paris,

13:52.866 --> 13:55.266
Village by village, off the radar.
He could make.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.769
A hell of a difference.
The resistance is divided.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.771
They need a leader.
Track his movements,

13:59.806 --> 14:01.773
Get his photo up. No photos.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.108
The man's a shadow.
How's interrogation going?

14:04.144 --> 14:06.110
I'm giving him.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.346
A short break
to think about life.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.348
And long enough.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.483
You like the map? Map's good.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.159
It's a long time coming.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.535
<i>In berlin,
the fuhrer built us an autobahn.</i>

14:30.570 --> 14:34.505
Fit for kings. But here?
I feel like a rat in a maze.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.542
The narrow
streets are positively medieval.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.378
I hear the panzers have joined
the 6th army in stalingrad.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.448
I wonder what route they
will take to come back.

14:45.685 --> 14:49.387
I don't think you should worry about it.
You know, because...

14:52.792 --> 14:55.293
Do you think they will
come back through france?

14:55.328 --> 14:57.395
More likely norway.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.064
I was recently in oslo.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.233
Our informants report increased.

15:02.268 --> 15:05.570
Allied activity
in the north sea.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.611
So it went well?

15:13.647 --> 15:16.080
What did? It sounds like.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.016
<i>The telephone call
with the fuhrer went well.</i>

15:18.051 --> 15:19.917
Yes. Fine.

15:22.989 --> 15:24.956
Who is that woman?

15:24.991 --> 15:28.092
<i>Frau helene bauer. She is
a good friend of my wife's.</i>

15:28.128 --> 15:30.928
<i>Where's frau faber this evening?
Ahem!</i>

15:35.368 --> 15:37.368
Franz.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.370
Are you enjoying the party?

15:39.406 --> 15:41.706
I would if my daughter were
on your arm where she belongs.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.775
She won't be coming
this evening. She hasn't been.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.277
Feeling well.
She was fine when I saw her.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.946
A few hours ago.
Our conversation was cut short.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.916
There was something on her mind.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.419
Is there anything I should know?

15:54.454 --> 15:56.454
I can't imagine.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.756
She's always been a happy girl,

15:58.792 --> 16:01.993
But ever since she moved to
paris she's become melancholy.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.729
It's been a difficult time for her.
So I hear.

16:04.764 --> 16:07.965
All the more reason
to keep her in good spirits.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.301
This is something
I trusted you with.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.837
I do my best. She has such.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.872
An affectionate disposition;

16:14.908 --> 16:16.908
She's ready to love
another child.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.876
A healthy child.

16:20.947 --> 16:23.481
It would be good
for both of you.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.783
Have you asked her
what she thinks about that?

16:33.293 --> 16:36.861
Excuse me, mademoiselle.
You look familiar.

16:36.896 --> 16:40.331
At this moment, your name escapes me, but I
could have sworn that we have met before.

16:40.366 --> 16:43.634
I'm sure
I would have remembered that.

16:43.670 --> 16:47.138
Rose? Rosa? Violette?

16:47.173 --> 16:50.074
Something to do with a colour.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.077
My name is helene.
Not very colourful, I'm afraid.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.614
I was hoping I'd see you here.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.983
Excuse us.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.554
I'm sorry, do I know you?

17:03.590 --> 17:06.022
I suppose you do now.
Heidi adler.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.092
I saw oster circling you
and thought it.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.828
My sisterly duty to rescue you.
Helene bauer.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.464
Thank you for the rescue.
He's not worth your time.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.434
He smiles like a bachelor,
but he has a wife back home.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.483
Do you know the guest of honour?
Yes, I'm a friend.

17:20.507 --> 17:24.108
Of the fabers.
So nice to meet you.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.611
Excuse me. I'll be...
I'll be right back.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.286
Good evening.
You must be sabine's father.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.522
I've heard so much about you.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.057
Horrible things, I'm sure.
Of course not.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.093
She loves you very much.

17:44.397 --> 17:48.099
Helene bauer.
I'm a friend of hers.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.868
Sabine shouldn't be
missing this. It's not right.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.870
But I'm sure
there's a good reason.

17:52.906 --> 17:56.207
She is prone to headaches.
Of course.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.379
I was so pleased when she said
you'd be here tonight.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.414
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

18:05.451 --> 18:09.854
She told me that you,
you wept for joy.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.857
When you heard that paris
was spared from the bombings,

18:12.892 --> 18:16.294
And I felt the same way.

18:16.329 --> 18:20.598
This city is like
a precious jewel.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.067
I think so too.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.169
It's the only city in europe.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.171
That feels enchanted.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.607
"Enchanted."

18:29.642 --> 18:32.543
It's a perfect word.

18:32.579 --> 18:36.247
"Enchanted." she did say
you have the soul of a poet.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.382
She said that?

18:42.789 --> 18:46.123
I can't imagine
you're here alone.

18:46.159 --> 18:50.928
Actually, my... My husband
isn't with us anymore.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.097
I'm sorry to hear it.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.800
Neither is my wife.
Sabine told me.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.668
My condolences.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.273
It's not a happy club.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.242
We're in, is it?

19:04.277 --> 19:06.544
Especially on evenings
like this.

19:08.615 --> 19:12.350
My husband was
a very good dancer.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.657
I'm sure I'm a bad substitute,

19:19.692 --> 19:22.326
But, the honour would be mine.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.817
You're a very good dancer.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.953
My elsa would have
disagreed with you.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.888
And she would have been wrong.!

19:50.924 --> 19:53.824
I'm... I'm so sorry! No, no, no.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.027
Not at all. My fault.
Well, perhaps we could.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.196
<i>Start again, ja? Let's do that.</i>

20:13.579 --> 20:16.558
Our only chance is when they take the prisoners
back to the truck, when they're exposed.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.549
I've only got eight rounds.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.751
Enough to get
each of them twice.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.228
Does she know we're here?
Yes, but...

20:31.264 --> 20:34.532
Good. What did she say?
She was pleased.

20:36.302 --> 20:40.271
But there's something else
you should know.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.373
Reinforcements.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.909
They're taking them
to the square.

20:48.047 --> 20:51.749
Over there!

21:20.070 --> 21:23.371
May i... Cut in?

21:40.457 --> 21:42.757
What were you doing
with schmidt?

21:42.792 --> 21:45.393
He asked me to dance.
I didn't want to be rude.

21:45.428 --> 21:47.662
You were to stay
on the sidelines.

21:47.697 --> 21:50.264
You're not my handler;
I am yours.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.968
If this is to continue,
you're going to follow my lead.

21:54.003 --> 21:56.771
Then stop stepping on my toes.

21:59.742 --> 22:02.143
Well...

22:07.917 --> 22:10.451
You came.
I guess I didn't need to.

22:10.487 --> 22:14.021
You already have a date.

22:14.057 --> 22:17.024
Sweetheart,
have you been drinking?

22:17.060 --> 22:20.294
I was told I had to come.
No one said I had to be sober.

22:20.330 --> 22:23.865
You look wonderful. It means
a lot to me that you're here.

22:23.900 --> 22:27.368
I'm not here for you.
There he is.

22:27.403 --> 22:30.138
I need another drink. Excuse me.

22:30.173 --> 22:32.073
Sabine.

22:32.108 --> 22:35.209
Let me.

22:57.867 --> 22:59.967
Combination.

23:07.810 --> 23:10.478
1, 9, 1, 2, 9, 1, 4, 5.

23:12.382 --> 23:15.850
Six numbers. 5, 1, 2, 1, 9, 1.

23:20.990 --> 23:23.357
8, 5, 9, 1, 2.

23:58.595 --> 24:00.561
How is your headache?

24:00.597 --> 24:03.231
It went away, but now it's back.

24:03.266 --> 24:05.666
Listen, before you do anything
you might regret...

24:05.702 --> 24:07.668
<i>Three vodkas, please.
Yes, madame.</i>

24:07.704 --> 24:11.005
Hello again, helene.
Hello. Sabine faber,

24:11.040 --> 24:13.074
Heidi adler.
I've heard so much about you.

24:13.109 --> 24:15.076
From your father.

24:15.111 --> 24:17.144
We worked together in poland,
in the same building.

24:17.180 --> 24:19.146
You've come a long way.
He said every german.

24:19.182 --> 24:21.148
Needs to see the city of lights
at least once,

24:21.184 --> 24:24.518
So he arranged me an invitation.

24:24.554 --> 24:26.520
<i>We'll drink
to the brigadefuhrer.</i>

24:26.556 --> 24:30.324
I don't like vodka...
It burns my throat.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.326
Haha! I never liked it either.

24:32.362 --> 24:34.595
But since I'm working in poland,
I learned to love it.

24:34.631 --> 24:36.764
What kind of work
do you do there?

24:36.799 --> 24:38.833
The kind that gets me invited
to parties like this.

24:38.868 --> 24:42.103
<i>As a guest of...
Obergruppenfuhrer schmidt?</i>

24:42.138 --> 24:45.740
No, no, no, no. The invitation came
in my name. I'm "unaccompanied."

24:49.412 --> 24:51.846
To being unaccompanied.
I thought.

24:51.881 --> 24:54.048
You didn't like vodka.

24:55.752 --> 24:57.752
Maybe I like it now.

25:08.431 --> 25:11.132
Pi. 3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 9.

25:15.872 --> 25:19.173
Fibonacci. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

25:22.779 --> 25:26.681
Euler's. 2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8.

25:38.695 --> 25:40.628
"Marigold."

25:49.872 --> 25:52.840
Argh!

25:52.875 --> 25:55.509
I want u-boat locations
in the north sea.

25:55.545 --> 25:57.578
Coordinates! I don't know!

25:57.613 --> 26:00.147
Of course you know.
You came here by u-boat.

26:00.183 --> 26:02.083
How would I know?!
Do you wanna go again?

26:02.118 --> 26:04.185
Because it's been so effective.

26:04.220 --> 26:07.254
Do not push me! Maybe you're
the one who needs a break.

26:07.290 --> 26:10.157
I'm fine.
Are you sure? Because I'm.

26:10.193 --> 26:13.527
The one who's supposed
to crack, not you.

26:13.563 --> 26:16.297
Is this how you interrogated klaus?
This has nothing to do.

26:16.332 --> 26:18.933
With him. Again. Argh!

26:18.968 --> 26:21.502
The u-boat pens,

26:21.537 --> 26:23.104
Where are they?

26:23.139 --> 26:24.872
I. Don't.

26:24.907 --> 26:26.607
Know! Let me help you.

26:26.642 --> 26:29.877
One syllable.

26:29.912 --> 26:32.947
Aaargh! Yes or no!

26:32.982 --> 26:35.883
Stavanger??

26:35.918 --> 26:37.885
No? Kristiansand?

26:37.920 --> 26:39.887
Are you sure?

26:39.922 --> 26:42.022
Bergen? Bergen?

26:42.058 --> 26:45.359
Yes, bergen. In norway?

26:45.395 --> 26:47.728
Yes. What are
your defences in norway?

26:51.768 --> 26:53.768
We're done here.

27:01.144 --> 27:03.244
It's really quite liberating.

27:13.256 --> 27:15.222
<i>Prost! Prost!</i>

27:18.528 --> 27:21.462
Excuse me. Is this yours?

27:29.405 --> 27:30.805
Sabine.

27:32.975 --> 27:34.775
Come here.

27:37.547 --> 27:40.714
Now, you're ready to talk.

27:40.750 --> 27:43.417
Where were you?
I went out for a walk.

27:43.453 --> 27:45.853
I needed to think about things.

27:45.888 --> 27:48.956
Everyone noticed your absence.
What about it?

27:48.991 --> 27:51.091
It reflects poorly
on your marriage.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.093
You know better.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.830
Than to air
your dirty laundry in public.

27:58.167 --> 28:00.734
Are you ready for your speech?

28:00.770 --> 28:02.970
Right. Right.

28:07.910 --> 28:09.143
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:09.178 --> 28:12.646
May I have
your attention please.

28:12.682 --> 28:16.417
I would like to introduce you
to our guest of honour,

28:16.452 --> 28:19.553
<i>Herr brigadefuhrer franz</i>

28:19.589 --> 28:21.455
Faber.

28:21.491 --> 28:24.158
And his beautiful wife, sabine.

28:33.603 --> 28:35.569
Thank you very much.

28:35.605 --> 28:38.472
Thank you very much. It is
a great honour for me to be here.

28:38.508 --> 28:41.108
With you all this evening.
You have been so welcoming.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.837
While it is a profound honour.

28:51.872 --> 28:53.839
To be entrusted
with this position,

28:53.874 --> 28:57.109
I'm struggling every day.

28:57.144 --> 29:00.379
Am I worthy?

29:00.414 --> 29:02.581
Am I worthy of any
of my life's blessings?

29:02.616 --> 29:05.017
And I realize,

29:05.052 --> 29:07.019
No, I'm not.

29:07.054 --> 29:08.687
I'm not yet.

29:08.722 --> 29:11.056
But

29:11.091 --> 29:15.761
I have faith
that, with the love that I feel.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.729
For germany,

29:17.765 --> 29:20.032
I will come to understand
better every day.

29:20.067 --> 29:21.967
What my true duty is.

29:22.002 --> 29:24.703
My true duty is to know
what is right.

29:24.738 --> 29:26.705
And what's wrong, and to follow.

29:26.740 --> 29:29.975
What's right
no matter what the cost.

29:30.010 --> 29:33.979
Because every choice
that we make.

29:34.014 --> 29:36.515
Shapes the future.

29:36.550 --> 29:38.550
For our families
and for ourselves.

29:38.585 --> 29:41.586
We have taken strides
toward victory.

29:41.622 --> 29:43.588
We have also known loss.

29:43.624 --> 29:46.324
We... Must grieve.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.760
So,

29:48.796 --> 29:51.930
For the sake of all the souls
watching us right now,

29:51.965 --> 29:54.399
Watching.

29:54.435 --> 29:56.668
Every choice that we make,

29:56.704 --> 29:58.804
Let us make them proud,

29:58.839 --> 30:00.806
Let us show them honour.

30:00.841 --> 30:05.310
And love, and do what is right.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.879
Because the future...
I have something to say.

30:09.883 --> 30:12.984
I want to make a toast.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.953
To my husband.

30:14.988 --> 30:16.955
Franz,

30:16.990 --> 30:19.891
I never thought you'd become
the man you are today.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.463
I hope we can all find
a way to live by your words.

30:30.637 --> 30:32.504
To the future!

30:32.539 --> 30:34.406
<i>Sieg...</i>

30:34.441 --> 30:35.674
<i>Heil!</i>

30:35.709 --> 30:38.043
<i>Sieg... Heil!</i>

30:38.078 --> 30:40.579
<i>Sieg... Heil!</i>

30:45.152 --> 30:47.552
Citizens of caillefaux, I expect.

30:47.588 --> 30:49.521
Your full attention.

30:53.327 --> 30:56.027
You are all to proceed.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.697
To the town square
for an important announcement.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.599
Move! Move!

31:03.570 --> 31:06.404
Attendance is mandatory.

31:06.440 --> 31:10.008
Hey, come on. Watching.

31:11.779 --> 31:14.346
Move, move, move!

31:15.883 --> 31:17.849
Everyone, move.

31:17.885 --> 31:20.085
Into the square, now!

31:22.823 --> 31:25.824
Move, move, move!

31:25.859 --> 31:27.726
Move now!

31:34.935 --> 31:37.269
Jacques rigaud,

31:37.304 --> 31:39.404
We know you are here.

31:39.439 --> 31:42.040
If you truly are
who you say you are,

31:42.075 --> 31:44.042
Don't hide like a coward.

31:44.077 --> 31:46.122
I thought rigaud was in exile.
We know someone here...

31:46.146 --> 31:48.124
You will not be harmed
if you come forward right now.

31:48.148 --> 31:49.915
Reveal yourself.

31:51.819 --> 31:54.152
Gentlemen, anything to share?

32:02.830 --> 32:05.230
Rigaud, we know
you're listening.

32:05.265 --> 32:08.967
We will execute these prisoners.

32:09.002 --> 32:11.536
One by one
until you step forward.

32:11.572 --> 32:13.905
This is what comes.

32:13.941 --> 32:15.974
Of aiding enemies of the reich.

32:16.009 --> 32:18.810
If any of you interfere,
you will be shot.

32:18.846 --> 32:23.782
The sooner
someone identifies rigaud,

32:23.817 --> 32:27.252
The more lives will be spared.

32:30.057 --> 32:31.623
No one?

32:37.598 --> 32:41.533
<i>Madame? Last chance. Non.</i>

32:55.716 --> 32:57.849
Does anyone have
anything to say?

33:03.891 --> 33:06.558
Stay quiet.

33:06.593 --> 33:09.661
There's a car waiting for you
at the gates.

33:13.734 --> 33:16.701
You need to leave. Now.

33:18.705 --> 33:21.806
You have friends on the outside
that want to help you.

33:21.842 --> 33:25.143
I can get you to the gate.
There's a truck waiting.

33:25.178 --> 33:27.679
It'll take you to
your safe house. Can you stand?

33:33.253 --> 33:36.054
Where are you taking him?

33:36.089 --> 33:38.423
Sergeant breeland wants him.

33:38.458 --> 33:41.026
Wants him where?

33:41.061 --> 33:43.028
I said, "wants him where?"

33:43.063 --> 33:45.030
She never said anything
about a transfer.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.998
Run! Hey!

33:47.034 --> 33:50.902
Stop right there!

33:50.938 --> 33:53.104
Stop him!

33:55.008 --> 33:56.975
Hey!

33:57.010 --> 33:59.010
Get back in the room!

34:00.948 --> 34:03.481
Rigaud?

34:03.517 --> 34:06.017
Reveal yourself!

34:06.053 --> 34:08.753
Who will help me
save their lives?

34:11.525 --> 34:13.591
No one.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.335
No.

34:40.387 --> 34:42.721
Please, rigaud.

34:42.755 --> 34:44.889
Save these people.

34:47.060 --> 34:49.694
Please, come on.
I can't do nothing.

34:49.730 --> 34:51.896
Come on, you know
what they're gonna do to you.

34:51.931 --> 34:53.931
Think about it.

34:56.069 --> 34:58.570
Does anyone have
anything to say?

35:00.974 --> 35:03.541
One word.

35:03.577 --> 35:05.543
And the young lady lives.

35:12.519 --> 35:14.953
Silence!

35:23.363 --> 35:25.430
I said, "silence!"

35:46.936 --> 35:48.936
Stop looking.

35:48.971 --> 35:51.739
I can't let them
keep dying for me.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.477
It's you.

35:57.980 --> 36:00.080
No. You can't turn yourself in.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.082
You're gonna give them
exactly what they want.

36:02.118 --> 36:04.151
And our friend, she's gonna
have died for nothing.

36:04.186 --> 36:07.421
Rigaud, identify yourself.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.623
My friend and I,

36:09.659 --> 36:12.326
We're heading back to paris.
We have friends.

36:12.361 --> 36:14.995
We can keep you safe.
Do you understand?

36:15.031 --> 36:16.997
France needs you right now.

36:17.033 --> 36:19.433
What about them?

36:21.938 --> 36:24.438
We both know they won't
be spared anyways.

36:41.791 --> 36:44.224
Thank you very much.
Have a lovely evening.

36:44.260 --> 36:46.160
Thank you.

36:46.195 --> 36:49.063
Franz, I've heard good news.

36:49.098 --> 36:51.365
Your agent in canada is alive.

36:53.436 --> 36:55.669
Good. He even managed.

36:55.705 --> 36:59.206
To radio intelligence about potential
allied landings in norway.

36:59.241 --> 37:01.542
I'm glad to hear that. I'm going.

37:01.577 --> 37:03.510
To make a recommendation
to berlin to consider.

37:03.546 --> 37:05.546
Fortifying our ports
along the north sea.

37:07.717 --> 37:11.518
It was an inspiring
speech, franz.

37:14.624 --> 37:17.157
It's been a privilege
serving with you.

37:19.161 --> 37:21.095
Yes.

37:41.050 --> 37:44.251
I thought I might stay here
with my father tonight.

37:44.286 --> 37:46.887
We have a lot to catch up on.

37:48.758 --> 37:51.058
Please come home with me.

37:55.231 --> 37:57.498
Everything I do,
every decision I make.

37:57.533 --> 38:00.401
Is for you, for us.

38:00.436 --> 38:03.804
Then maybe it's time you start
including me in those decisions.

38:06.142 --> 38:08.142
I promise.

38:15.985 --> 38:18.585
They're planning
to occupy all of france now.

38:18.621 --> 38:20.721
No more demarcation line. When?

38:20.756 --> 38:22.523
Soon.

38:22.558 --> 38:24.591
All the remaining
french authorities.

38:24.627 --> 38:27.094
Will be replaced by germans.

38:27.129 --> 38:30.597
Just when the resistance
is turning against itself.

38:30.633 --> 38:33.834
Communists, students, catholics;

38:33.869 --> 38:36.270
None of them can agree
on a course of action.

38:36.305 --> 38:38.806
They'll listen to you.
Maybe. We'll see.

38:42.178 --> 38:44.812
We could all use
a sign of hope right about now.

39:42.138 --> 39:44.138
Come on.

39:59.522 --> 40:02.489
They're blanks.

40:02.525 --> 40:05.292
Don't! He's still disoriented.

40:05.327 --> 40:07.294
From the interrogation.

40:07.329 --> 40:09.763
A man with his training,
he might have noticed a tail.

40:09.799 --> 40:11.999
But he was in a hurry
to get here.

40:12.034 --> 40:14.635
Sure he was. We gave him
a nice nugget to radio home...

40:14.670 --> 40:18.272
That the allies are preparing
an invasion through norway.

40:18.307 --> 40:20.474
Keeps the focus
off north africa.

40:20.509 --> 40:23.744
It helps when you let them
underestimate you.

40:23.779 --> 40:26.280
We have a promise.

40:26.315 --> 40:28.549
An honourable death.

40:31.987 --> 40:33.420
Do you pray?

40:33.455 --> 40:36.089
No.

40:41.530 --> 40:43.897
They're facing a crisis.

40:43.933 --> 40:46.233
German oil supply
is draining fast.

40:46.268 --> 40:49.169
They're predicting they'll be
immobilized by spring.

40:49.205 --> 40:50.938
So they're actually vulnerable.

40:50.973 --> 40:52.172
Except,

40:52.208 --> 40:55.409
According to this...
They're projecting.

40:55.444 --> 40:57.845
A surge in oil production
in march?

40:57.880 --> 40:59.947
It's part of a highly
classified project.

40:59.982 --> 41:03.517
Operation marigold.
What do we think that is?

41:03.552 --> 41:06.186
New refineries?
Bigger refineries?

41:06.222 --> 41:07.855
And there's nothing
in there about where?

41:07.890 --> 41:09.690
No. We'll find out.

41:09.725 --> 41:11.358
Yeah, we do have a new asset.

41:11.393 --> 41:13.293
Microfilm the transcripts.

41:13.329 --> 41:15.195
I'll get the negatives
back to camp.

41:15.231 --> 41:17.197
Send for mayhew. Yes, sir.

41:17.233 --> 41:19.533
Thank you, alfred.
Could I speak to you, please?

41:19.568 --> 41:21.602
Yeah.

41:27.009 --> 41:28.942
You and alfred.

41:28.978 --> 41:30.911
Did good work.

41:30.946 --> 41:33.881
Thank you, sir.

41:33.916 --> 41:36.817
I'm gonna trust your judgment.

41:36.852 --> 41:38.852
On how to deal with him.

41:38.888 --> 41:42.489
Alfred?
Aurora, his feelings for you.

41:42.524 --> 41:44.524
Make you all vulnerable.

41:47.263 --> 41:49.329
I know what I'm doing.
I can handle it.

41:49.365 --> 41:52.566
Faber knows. What's going on?

41:52.601 --> 41:54.835
End it. He's got a list.

41:54.870 --> 41:57.337
Of contacts we need to get
in touch with as soon as we can.

41:57.373 --> 41:59.139
Thank you for sheltering me.

42:00.876 --> 42:02.409
Explain.

42:02.444 --> 42:04.278
Jacques rigaud,

42:04.313 --> 42:06.280
Special envoy
from general de gaulle.

42:06.315 --> 42:08.315
This is lieutenant colonel
duncan sinclair.

42:12.688 --> 42:15.155
Special operations
said you'd be back.

42:15.190 --> 42:17.291
Good to see it's true. I'm sorry.

42:17.326 --> 42:19.927
For your losses at dieppe.
I'm here to help,

42:19.962 --> 42:22.095
So when it's time
for the next landing,

42:22.131 --> 42:24.031
We're ready for the fight.

42:24.066 --> 42:27.100
Thank you. Don't thank me.

42:27.136 --> 42:29.703
Thank his friend.

42:34.810 --> 42:37.678
Let's get to work then.
