FILM 4

01:08.280 --> 01:11.120
<i>The day gives man food.</i>

01:11.760 --> 01:13.560
<i>The night gives him hunger.</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:20.120
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL No. 13

01:32.680 --> 01:34.440
When did you hallucinate?

01:35.040 --> 01:36.200
Yesterday.

01:37.560 --> 01:38.760
For a long time?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.080
I don’t remember.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.640
-Has it begun?
-Yes.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.840
You’re having delusions.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.560
A short but intense
clouding of the consciousness.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.080
Your brain is tired of fighting.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.600
It’s a white flag.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.240
You told me that I had time-- a year.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.240
It depends on various factors.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.600
Treatment.

02:24.480 --> 02:25.720
Lifestyle.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.200
You should seek treatment with us.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.440
No. Out of the question.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.240
Then prepare yourself.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.120
The episodes will be more frequent…

02:42.400 --> 02:44.560
the intervals between them shorter.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.080
-Well, and then--
-Death.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.480
A slow death.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.880
With open eyes, yeah?

03:03.280 --> 03:04.680
PERPHENAZINE

03:05.360 --> 03:07.200
Get your affairs in order.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.520
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

03:36.720 --> 03:37.920
<i>I love you.</i>

03:38.640 --> 03:40.160
Meglin didn’t pick the cases.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.120
He went wherever they said.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.600
Except for this case.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.840
He made sure he got the assignment
in Mikhailovsk.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.440
-I asked him to.
-How’s that?

03:56.800 --> 03:59.320
Glukhoi compiled a database
of missing children

03:59.960 --> 04:01.480
covering the entire country.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.080
Studying the material, I discovered that…

04:06.120 --> 04:08.960
in Mikhailovsk,
children went missing more often.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.480
They’re all from troubled families.
They’re around the same age.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.160
When another one went missing,
I went to Meglin.

04:27.040 --> 04:31.160
And he decided to go there
solely based on your intuition.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.000
He said exactly the same thing.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.800
Word for word.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.560
Solely based on my intuition.

04:42.960 --> 04:47.080
He wanted to check if I had the instinct.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.600
MIKHAILOVSK MAYOR’S OFFICE

05:12.240 --> 05:14.560
Did Vanya tell you
where he was going that day?

05:15.240 --> 05:16.640
Yes, in the morning!

05:18.000 --> 05:21.640
He said, “Mom, I’ll be home early.
I don’t want to go to the club.”

05:21.720 --> 05:26.040
I said, “Why not?
You have a memorial hike on the ninth.”

05:26.760 --> 05:27.600
A barbecue!

05:27.680 --> 05:30.200
A barbecue and a hike,
and he didn’t want to go!

05:30.280 --> 05:33.120
They made a man out of him there.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.320
If he hadn’t skipped it,
maybe this would’ve never happened.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.320
It was Loshka who put him up to it!

05:45.400 --> 05:47.280
It’s those guys from Moscow.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.080
Bring me some water.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.240
That’s Meglin.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.520
There are no grounds
on which to investigate these cases,

06:16.600 --> 06:18.960
much less to connect them.

06:19.560 --> 06:23.320
The children on your list
are from troubled families.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.640
Some ran away.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.240
No bodies were found.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.880
They have nothing in common.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.240
-Did they have mutual friends?
-It’s possible.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.000
These two were in Romantic.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.600
-They easily could’ve crossed paths there.
-Romantic?

06:37.680 --> 06:40.040
It’s a children’s hiking club--
our pride and joy.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.200
-Who’s the leader of your pride and joy?
-What are you saying?

06:44.480 --> 06:45.360
No!

06:46.720 --> 06:50.600
Romantic is 15 years old.
It does so many good things!

06:50.680 --> 06:55.320
They go on hikes,
plant trees around the whole city.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.600
Memorial barbecues. I know all about it.
The name of the leader.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.720
Anatoly Valeryanich Golovko.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.040
A respected teacher in Russia.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.400
Yes, these children…

07:12.480 --> 07:15.480
He takes them off the streets
and reunites them with their families.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.040
Well meaning. Nothing more to say.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.640
What, it’s that easy?

07:23.160 --> 07:25.600
-Is that how you work?
-Did you run a background check on him?

07:25.680 --> 07:27.360
Yes, and I’m proud of it.

07:27.440 --> 07:28.240
-What?
-Water.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.200
-Get out of here!
-Yulia--

07:34.400 --> 07:36.000
Can I have some water?

07:36.080 --> 07:38.480
Thank you. My throat was dry.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.320
Actually, we have a theory.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.520
I’m sorry. What do you have?

07:46.240 --> 07:49.200
There is one place that’s… a death trap.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.680
The boys go there often.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.840
I actually don’t think anyone killed them.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.840
-Shall we look?
-Of course.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.240
Don’t cause a panic until you have to,
right?

08:01.400 --> 08:04.320
How many go missing every year
in our country?

08:04.400 --> 08:06.920
1,100 maybe, yeah? No big deal.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.560
No bodies means they’re alive.
That’s called total optimism.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.200
So don’t lose hope,

08:14.000 --> 08:14.880
comrades.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.320
Shall we go?

08:18.520 --> 08:20.520
GHOUL

08:37.240 --> 08:38.440
-Don’t!
-Where is it?

08:38.520 --> 08:40.080
-I can’t!
-Where is it?

08:42.679 --> 08:46.480
Where is it? Give it to me!
Give it to me. I’ll die.

08:46.560 --> 08:50.320
I’ll die! I’ll die!

08:50.400 --> 08:53.920
-Give it to me! I’ll die!
-I can’t.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.440
-Give it to me, bitch!
-Let her go!

08:55.520 --> 08:58.120
Let her go! Let her go!

08:59.240 --> 09:00.720
Let her go!

09:01.960 --> 09:04.520
Pasha! Don’t touch him!

09:04.600 --> 09:05.720
Shut up!

09:07.600 --> 09:09.600
-Pashenka!
-Mama!

09:09.680 --> 09:10.720
Pashenka!

09:11.760 --> 09:13.400
Mommy!

09:26.200 --> 09:27.400
Anatoly Valeryanich.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.360
Can I take my knife home?

09:30.440 --> 09:33.160
-And me!
-Please, can I take it?

09:33.600 --> 09:36.240
-What for?
-To show Mama.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.080
No, you can’t.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.280
ROMANTIC POLICE

10:08.080 --> 10:09.560
Here it is.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.840
Local drunks have fallen off the cliffs
a few times.

10:18.280 --> 10:22.160
The boys are always hanging around here,
even when we run them off.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.360
See for yourself what kind of place it is.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.560
I assume they fell off the cliff here.

10:28.640 --> 10:32.560
There’s a whirlpool down there.
No body whatsoever would surface.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.000
-Does anyone have a long rope?
-Do we have one?

10:35.600 --> 10:36.960
Get it! Quickly!

10:37.560 --> 10:38.840
Why do you need a rope?

10:38.920 --> 10:41.160
I’ll go down there.
Maybe I’ll find something interesting.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.520
-Have you got a feeling?
-Something like that.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.880
Thanks.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.000
Will you hold me?

10:49.840 --> 10:50.720
-Sure!
-Thanks!

10:50.800 --> 10:52.560
I can see you’re the strongest one here.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.320
There you go.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.560
So, all six fell off the cliff?

10:59.680 --> 11:01.960
Well, why not? This place is a death trap.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.560
-Just hold on tight.
-You bet!

11:06.640 --> 11:08.440
My life is in your hands now, yeah?

11:08.520 --> 11:09.520
-Yes.
-Are you holding?

11:09.600 --> 11:12.480
I’m pulling. Oops! All right.
Now like this. One second.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.280
Hold this.

11:14.720 --> 11:15.560
That’s it.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.640
Hold on! Hold on to the captain.
Or else you’ll go to prison.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.600
He supposes boys have been
falling off here for 10 years.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.560
What do you suppose now, huh?

11:30.920 --> 11:32.160
You psycho!

11:32.840 --> 11:35.240
I’ll find you in your Moscow!

11:35.320 --> 11:37.920
-Where are we going now?
-To learn about Romantic.

11:39.440 --> 11:45.240
“ROMANTIC” HIKING CLUB

11:59.360 --> 12:01.080
ROMANTIC HIKING CLUB
CITY OF MIKHAILOVSK

12:01.160 --> 12:03.040
What’s the most important thing
in our club?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.360
The code.

12:06.360 --> 12:10.240
On a hike, Kapustin refused to carry
the backpack of a companion

12:10.320 --> 12:11.640
who had an injured leg.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.720
He decided to save his strength.
He showed cowardice.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.080
Hello.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.960
He violated the code.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.200
What should we do with him?
I’m asking your opinion.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.920
-Volodya.
-Exclude him!

12:29.000 --> 12:30.280
Kostya.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.880
Exclude him
without the right to forgiveness.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.320
-Masha.
-Exclude him.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.040
-With the right to forgiveness.
-What, Masha? Are you in love?

12:38.120 --> 12:40.880
Jerk! And what if it were you?

12:40.960 --> 12:45.240
I would’ve taken Vitka’s backpack.
And you can leave the club with him.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.840
-This isn’t your club. Got it?
-Quiet!

12:51.000 --> 12:54.080
I have one vote, like each of you.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
If you decide to exclude Kapustin,
then so be it.

13:00.640 --> 13:04.160
But I’m asking you to think it over well.

13:05.520 --> 13:09.080
Seryozha’s mother died.
His father was killed.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.120
He lives with his grandmother.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.600
But his grandmother didn’t
bring him to the club. The police did.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.760
Because he stole in school,
more than once.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.840
Yes, he showed weakness.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.720
And what should we do now--
kick him out into the street?

13:31.120 --> 13:34.600
The code is important to us,
but so are people.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.920
Let’s vote.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.520
Who votes
to exclude Kapustin from the club?

13:43.400 --> 13:45.240
Who votes to forgive him?

13:48.520 --> 13:49.720
It’s unanimous.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.280
Thank you.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.960
Don’t tell me. Tell them.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.640
And don’t make them regret it.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.440
You’re free to go. Pasha.

14:03.640 --> 14:04.960
Stay behind.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.720
What happened?

14:19.160 --> 14:20.840
All right. Go.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.520
-Who are you?
-We’re from the school board.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.720
-This is all a waste.
-What?

14:32.880 --> 14:34.080
Your charade.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.520
Don’t look here. You’re wasting time.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.880
Aren’t you really from Moscow?

14:48.240 --> 14:50.760
The whole club and I
searched for each of these kids.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.880
For several days.

14:53.680 --> 14:58.400
Of course, I have some fault in this.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.080
Not all of them could be saved,
but I fought for each of them.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.320
Several left.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.280
Nonetheless, I think they’re alive.

15:09.520 --> 15:13.240
If something happened to them, God forbid,
we would’ve found them.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.840
-Or they were hidden well.
-I don’t even want to think about it.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.280
Then no one will ever find them.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.720
Let’s go. Mom?

15:56.600 --> 15:57.800
Who’s there?

15:59.600 --> 16:00.840
Come outside.

16:01.440 --> 16:02.640
Come outside.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.720
Stand there and don’t get involved.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.800
Don’t pass out.

16:43.880 --> 16:47.600
You won’t remember.
And I want you to remember.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.240
Touch them, and I’ll strangle you.

16:50.320 --> 16:53.920
Everyone will say you hung yourself
while you were drunk.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Do you understand?

16:55.520 --> 16:56.760
Do you understand?

16:56.840 --> 16:58.200
I understand!

17:02.600 --> 17:03.800
Come in. Don’t be scared.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.079
Look at him. Drank himself into a stupor.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.560
“I don’t want to live,” he says.
“I’ll hang myself.”

17:41.800 --> 17:42.920
Well?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.920
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.440
Why are you sure they’ll be here?

17:48.520 --> 17:50.720
A park or an amusement park--
where else would kids be?

17:50.800 --> 17:53.440
What, are we going to interrogate them?
They won’t say anything.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.240
Those who’ve been hurt will talk.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.320
There’s the blond one.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.640
-He’s in Romantic, yeah?
-Yes.

18:00.560 --> 18:01.560
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.480
Are you going to have cotton candy?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.800
-Make one, please.
-Do you come here often?

18:06.400 --> 18:07.720
Couple times.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.240
Where’d you get the money? Steal it?

18:09.320 --> 18:11.720
-What?
-Where did you get the money?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.080
-I--
-You what?

18:13.160 --> 18:14.640
-I can’t talk.
-Where’d you get it?

18:16.160 --> 18:17.400
Get the cotton candy.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.240
Well?

18:32.600 --> 18:36.240
I… don’t remember a lot.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.040
I passed out.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.280
Tell us what you remember.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.760
Do you remember better?

19:08.240 --> 19:09.440
Sit down.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.440
Change clothes.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.200
It’s all your fault, you bastard!
Stinking alcoholic!

20:10.280 --> 20:11.480
-You’re never around!
-Shut up!

20:11.560 --> 20:14.360
-What do you mean shut up?
-If you’d fed him right!

20:14.440 --> 20:16.600
-What are you saying?
-He has porridge sunup to sundown!

20:16.680 --> 20:18.720
-Who feeds who around here?
-Porridge is coming out of his ears!

20:18.800 --> 20:22.120
I made some money and gave it to you.
I said, “Buy the boy some sneakers.”

20:22.200 --> 20:24.320
Where are the sneakers?
Where’s the money? Slut!

20:24.400 --> 20:26.120
When were you at the parents’ meeting?

20:26.200 --> 20:27.800
Has he been gone long? Has he been gone long?

20:30.560 --> 20:31.360
A day already.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.000
He left in the morning and never returned.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.280
Make the call.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.760
This is the last time I’m helping you.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.760
You higher-ups and your dogs.
You won’t find anything. A dog won’t help.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.240
Give me the bag.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.600
-Should we release the dog?
-One minute.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.200
Munya, smell. Smell.

21:11.240 --> 21:12.680
There you go! Good girl.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.520
Munya, search. Search. Search.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.360
Here.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.560
What, is she hungry?

23:10.080 --> 23:12.480
You need to feed the dog on time!

23:12.920 --> 23:15.480
Why are you standing around staring?
Everyone back!

23:15.560 --> 23:16.840
Quickly!

23:17.400 --> 23:18.480
Keep looking!

23:49.920 --> 23:52.080
-How many children went missing?
-Seven.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.480
Seven.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.200
One, two,

23:57.280 --> 23:58.800
three, four,

23:59.720 --> 24:01.440
five, six.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.720
Seven!

24:03.720 --> 24:05.320
What are you doing?

24:09.560 --> 24:11.040
Or they were hidden well.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.480
Then no one will ever find them.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.320
The soil is fresh.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.560
These are gallows! These are graves!
It’s a cemetery.

24:23.880 --> 24:27.120
He buried them under these birch trees
they planted.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.920
Where are your pills? Where are the pills?

24:49.880 --> 24:52.440
Don’t be afraid. I’ll handle everything.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.120
You’ll only pass out for a few seconds.

24:57.600 --> 25:03.240
Then a lot of people will be thanking you
after I publish my book.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.640
Sailors, astronauts,

25:08.480 --> 25:10.120
pilots.

25:15.520 --> 25:16.520
Are you ready?

25:17.240 --> 25:18.440
Deep breath.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.360
So, you followed my tracks, yeah?

27:36.960 --> 27:39.440
You’re an old hack, huh?
With a clever face.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.000
Well?

28:16.920 --> 28:19.640
-What are you taking?
-I don’t know. Probably cognac.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.240
I mean the pills.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.560
Well? Should we take him in?

28:31.640 --> 28:33.680
-Who?
-Tolik.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.680
Anatoly Valeryanich Golovko.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.600
It’s not him. I was wrong.
We have to keep looking.

28:52.800 --> 28:53.520
Why are you--

28:53.600 --> 28:55.840
What should we do with a child killer?

28:58.120 --> 28:59.880
I’d give him to the parents.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.640
Do you need something?

29:59.080 --> 30:01.440
REMEMBER OUR FRIENDS

30:01.520 --> 30:05.120
Anatoly Valeryanich, my dear!
Look what I brought!

30:05.200 --> 30:06.520
Excuse me, please.

30:06.600 --> 30:10.520
A new Czech tent.
We try our best to help the club.

30:11.680 --> 30:15.080
And also a flag for Romantic’s 15th year.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.960
Made according to your sketches.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.400
“Romantic.”

31:18.960 --> 31:22.000
It’s him. I know it and you know it.
What are we waiting for?

31:22.760 --> 31:25.080
We need to prove it to them-- the parents.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.080
And you aren’t afraid
that on this hike he’ll--

31:27.160 --> 31:28.160
No.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.240
He’s going to be scared now.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.360
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.720
-Wait for me.
-Good-bye.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.280
-We’ll be waiting.
-Bye.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.000
Rom, come on!

31:57.520 --> 31:59.360
Faster!

32:00.080 --> 32:02.560
Roma, be brave. Be brave.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.400
Come on, come on.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.400
Don’t be afraid!

32:06.480 --> 32:07.920
Come on, come on. Be brave.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.480
-Come on!
-Be brave!

32:10.720 --> 32:13.200
-He’s going to drown.
-Let him manage on his own.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.680
-Come on!
-Well?

32:14.760 --> 32:18.000
Are you a Romantic or a coward?
Are you a man or a weakling?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.600
Come on, come on!

32:24.840 --> 32:25.760
Roma!

32:27.920 --> 32:29.800
Roma!

32:29.880 --> 32:31.560
Hang on, Roma!

32:31.640 --> 32:33.600
Swim this way! Come on!

32:33.680 --> 32:35.800
Roma! Come on! Roma!

32:35.880 --> 32:37.760
Roma! Swim this way!

32:38.760 --> 32:40.200
-Come on, swim!
-Come on!

32:42.320 --> 32:44.160
Come on, swim!

32:46.840 --> 32:48.240
Come on! Come on!

32:48.320 --> 32:50.400
Come on, grab me. Roma.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.360
-Hold on.
-Come on. Hurry.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.680
Good job, Roma!

33:04.400 --> 33:05.320
Good job!

33:06.400 --> 33:07.800
You’re a hero!

33:10.880 --> 33:12.000
THANK YOU, TOLIK!

33:12.080 --> 33:14.400
-If only there were more like him.
-Thank you!

33:14.960 --> 33:16.680
Good job, Tolik.

33:35.880 --> 33:39.960
Tolik, you’re so sad today. What happened?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.200
Children.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.960
Remember this moment…

33:55.680 --> 33:57.080
this evening.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.280
This is real.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.800
And all the rest…

34:47.719 --> 34:48.920
Tolik…

34:50.480 --> 34:55.080
I wish that you could be my papa.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.760
I understand that it can’t be.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.240
But I wish it could.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.040
Hold me. Hold on.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.640
Can you crawl through?

36:27.360 --> 36:31.320
He got satisfaction out of what he did
to those kids. He’s a sadist.

36:32.600 --> 36:35.200
But you say
these people can’t stop themselves.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.320
Then why?

36:38.280 --> 36:41.600
He only killed seven.
There should’ve been more victims.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.160
Or didn’t we find them all?

36:45.760 --> 36:47.440
This is all the vestibule.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.200
The sanctuary should be somewhere.

39:59.760 --> 40:03.400
Anatoly Valeryanich, let the kids go.
They’re tired.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.840
Yes. Of course.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.280
Everyone go home.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.400
A big thank-you to everyone.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.440
Fifteen years.

40:42.880 --> 40:46.360
More than 100 hikes,
and no one was ever hurt.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.800
Not one scratch.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.680
-I loved them.
-You loved them?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.640
You conducted these grand experiments

40:53.720 --> 40:57.440
so that astronauts and submariners
would be proud of the kids?

40:58.720 --> 41:00.680
I didn’t want to kill anyone.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.360
Not anyone.

41:03.440 --> 41:07.080
I just read
that strangulation can cause amnesia.

41:07.160 --> 41:10.000
You did it so they wouldn’t remember
what you did to them?

41:12.840 --> 41:16.720
You saved them from juvenile hall
and drugs and then killed them. Why?

41:17.480 --> 41:20.480
I got carried away.
I kept them in the noose too long.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.960
What were you doing?
“In the noose too long”?

41:23.040 --> 41:23.840
Stop it.

41:30.280 --> 41:33.320
I… For 20 years, I lived in hell.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.040
I never wanted to be with women.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.360
It didn’t work out with my wife.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.920
This obsession started long ago,
as a child.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.200
Well, don’t worry, Tolik.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.080
<i>It doesn’t matter who it was.</i>

41:50.400 --> 41:51.800
<i>He’s not here anymore.</i> <i>Our neighbor.</i>

41:54.640 --> 41:58.480
<i>But, with the club, I wanted</i>
<i>to protect the kids from everything.</i>

41:59.320 --> 42:01.680
<i>And I was supposed to keep them</i>
<i>away from that.</i>

42:02.120 --> 42:05.280
<i>I couldn’t on my own.</i>
<i>I couldn’t forget it all.</i>

42:06.480 --> 42:07.800
Are you ready?

42:07.880 --> 42:08.840
Deep breath.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.040
<i>I tried, but I saw it all the time.</i>

42:15.120 --> 42:18.480
I wanted to stop. I wanted to kill myself.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.600
I went into the woods
and prepared a noose.

42:20.680 --> 42:22.560
I… I couldn’t do it.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.120
It was painful.

42:26.040 --> 42:30.560
You don’t know what it’s like
to be in pain your entire life.

42:31.320 --> 42:32.720
Twenty years of pain.

42:34.640 --> 42:35.960
Give me your hand.

42:56.560 --> 42:57.680
Now that’s pain.

42:59.360 --> 43:00.680
Real pain.

43:02.960 --> 43:03.760
Leave. Why?

43:06.480 --> 43:07.960
We don’t need you anymore.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.360
We have everything we need.

43:12.960 --> 43:15.000
What do we need? A rope? Yeah, Tolik?

43:16.600 --> 43:20.400
I’m not leaving. I don’t agree.
The parents should be his judge. Not you.

43:21.400 --> 43:22.200
Get out.

43:23.480 --> 43:25.080
Get out!

43:34.200 --> 43:35.680
So, Tol?

43:36.080 --> 43:37.800
Let’s be honest.

43:41.120 --> 43:44.480
So what happened next was your idea?

43:44.560 --> 43:46.440
Are you accusing me of something?

43:46.880 --> 43:47.960
I’m just asking.

43:48.560 --> 43:52.840
Meglin always did
only what he thought was right.

43:54.080 --> 43:57.040
The question is,
did you consider this right?

43:57.120 --> 43:58.320
Yes.

44:25.120 --> 44:27.120
THANK YOU, TOLIK!

44:31.440 --> 44:32.440
Son of a bitch!

45:01.800 --> 45:03.800
Yeah! Burn him alive!

46:12.400 --> 46:16.720
MOSCOW

46:26.360 --> 46:27.760
I’ll be damned.

46:28.240 --> 46:30.880
You missed me so much
you didn’t even call.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.240
Get out of here.

46:44.040 --> 46:46.080
-Go on, get out of here.
-What are you doing, idiot?

46:46.160 --> 46:48.080
Go on. Outside. Go.

46:49.280 --> 46:50.280
Where--

47:00.280 --> 47:01.640
Yeah.

47:02.200 --> 47:05.040
Training under Meglin
has made you good with people.

47:06.880 --> 47:08.880
You lucked out with your partner, yeah?

48:48.640 --> 48:50.240
Is something wrong?

49:21.960 --> 49:27.320
TROITSK
