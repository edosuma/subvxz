WEBVTT

00:00.188 --> 00:01.568
So here's what you missed
on <i>Glee</i>...

00:01.568 --> 00:03.185
<i>Mr. Shue's in Washington,</i>

00:03.235 --> 00:04.854
<i>so now Finn's in charge</i>
<i>of the glee club, and they have</i>

00:04.905 --> 00:06.285
<i>to win Sectionals,</i>
<i>which is just a week away.</i>

00:06.307 --> 00:08.576
<i>Blaine cheated on Kurt, and</i>
<i>he's super broken up about it,</i>

00:08.610 --> 00:09.977
<i>and Kurt's the whole reason</i>
<i>Blaine came to McKinley,</i>

00:09.995 --> 00:11.412
<i>and now he's gone</i>
<i>and Blaine's all alone.</i>

00:11.446 --> 00:13.364
<i>Jake saw Ryder and Marley kiss,</i>
<i>and even though</i>

00:13.415 --> 00:15.199
<i>she's super skinny</i>
<i>and super beautiful,</i>

00:15.250 --> 00:16.951
<i>Kitty's got Marley convinced</i>
<i>that she's gaining weight.</i>

00:16.985 --> 00:18.953
The stage always adds
at least ten pounds.

00:18.987 --> 00:20.337
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:24.009 --> 00:26.326
The Secret Society
of Superheroes Club

00:26.344 --> 00:27.661
is now in session.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.597
It is the purpose of this club
to fight injustice,

00:29.631 --> 00:30.998
to right
all that which is wrong,

00:31.016 --> 00:32.665
and to preserve truth,
justice and peace

00:32.683 --> 00:34.001
in the halls of McKinley High.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.669
First order of business...
roll call.

00:35.687 --> 00:36.670
Go.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.005
Asian Persuasion here.

00:38.023 --> 00:40.941
My superpower is being
the mistress of manipulation.

00:40.976 --> 00:42.175
(Ã  la George W. Bush):
Blond Chameleon here.

00:42.194 --> 00:43.677
My superpower is
I can impersonate anybody.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.679
George W. Bush, heh.

00:45.697 --> 00:46.814
Tarantula Head here.

00:46.848 --> 00:48.348
My superpower is lashing you
with my dreads.

00:48.366 --> 00:49.349
(whip cracks)

00:49.367 --> 00:51.184
Sweet 'n' Spicy, here.

00:51.203 --> 00:53.320
My superpower is money.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.655
Second order of business...

00:54.689 --> 00:56.790
inducting new members
into our ever-swelling ranks.

00:56.825 --> 00:59.359
Candidates, come forth.

00:59.377 --> 01:00.794
Excited to be here, Blaine.

01:00.829 --> 01:02.463
First of all, there are no

01:02.497 --> 01:04.798
civilian identities
in here, okay?

01:04.833 --> 01:07.501
I am Nightbird
the Nocturnal Avenger.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.036
And second of all, I really
hope you're not trying

01:09.054 --> 01:10.971
to pass yourself off
as a certain telepathic leader

01:11.006 --> 01:12.372
of a certain group
of superhuman mutants

01:12.390 --> 01:14.341
because that would be
a copyright violation.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.927
Uh, I'm Dr. Y

01:16.978 --> 01:20.213
and my superpower is wheelies?

01:20.232 --> 01:22.049
Welcome, Dr. Y.
Next.

01:22.067 --> 01:25.385
I'm Queen Bee
and I can sting like a bitch.

01:25.403 --> 01:26.386
(buzzes)

01:26.404 --> 01:28.188
Welcome, Queen Bee.
Next.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.406
I'm the Human Brain.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.326
Welcome, Human Brain.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.444
(phone chimes)

01:33.495 --> 01:34.561
What's this?

01:34.579 --> 01:36.330
A text just came through
on my NightPhone.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.165
"Have you talked to Kurt?"

01:38.199 --> 01:39.700
I already told you,

01:39.734 --> 01:41.335
Asian Persuasion,

01:41.369 --> 01:43.403
this account is only supposed
to be for emergencies,

01:43.421 --> 01:45.039
and you cannot use
your powers of manipulation

01:45.073 --> 01:46.073
to coax me into getting

01:46.091 --> 01:48.408
back with my ex, so stop trying.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.512
What is it, Chai Tea?

01:51.546 --> 01:53.013
Emergency in the choir room.

01:53.048 --> 01:54.098
To the choir room.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.445 --> 02:09.145
Someone took
your Nationals trophy

02:09.197 --> 02:11.264
and left that laptop
in its place.

02:11.283 --> 02:12.399
ARTIE:
Who leaves a laptop?

02:12.433 --> 02:14.267
Someone rich,

02:14.286 --> 02:15.936
someone who wanted
to send us a message.

02:15.954 --> 02:17.738
I got this.

02:21.293 --> 02:23.260
(distorted):
Greetings, New Directions!

02:23.295 --> 02:27.781
You have been living as national
champions on borrowed time,

02:27.799 --> 02:29.617
and that ends now.

02:31.119 --> 02:32.419
We have your trophy.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.754
Soon we'll have your title

02:33.788 --> 02:34.788
as well.

02:34.806 --> 02:37.057
The great reckoning is at hand...

02:37.092 --> 02:38.892
Sectionals.

02:38.927 --> 02:40.961
Your move.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.497
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

02:45.617 --> 02:47.134
(school bell ringing)

02:50.155 --> 02:54.108
So, are you jumping
on this superhero bandwagon?

02:54.142 --> 02:57.361
A club where you have
to wear full-body spandex?

02:57.412 --> 02:58.946
Not really my thing.

02:58.980 --> 03:00.147
Good, that means you'll be free

03:00.165 --> 03:03.450
to hang out Friday night...
you and me.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.651
What do you say?

03:04.669 --> 03:06.754
Um... I...

03:06.788 --> 03:07.755
RYDER:
Marley's got

03:07.789 --> 03:09.089
plans on Friday, dude.

03:09.124 --> 03:11.324
The football team's
got an away game

03:11.343 --> 03:13.127
at Lawrence, and I asked her
if she'd come cheer us on.

03:13.161 --> 03:14.628
See, Jake, it's funny.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.096
Girls don't like it
when you make it seem

03:16.131 --> 03:17.598
like you're really into them

03:17.632 --> 03:18.632
and then totally blow them off.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.334
You know what, dude?

03:21.353 --> 03:23.170
I don't remember asking
for your opinion.

03:23.188 --> 03:24.838
Guys, don't do this.
Whoa.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.106
Whoa, you're
really intimidating.

03:26.141 --> 03:27.441
Let me ask you
a question... what kind

03:27.475 --> 03:28.842
of a name is Ryder Lynn
anyway? 'Cause it sounds

03:28.860 --> 03:30.010
like your parents named you
after a cowgirl doll

03:30.028 --> 03:32.345
who comes with her own pony.

03:32.364 --> 03:34.314
Look, man, I don't
want any trouble.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.150
I know you're a badass.
You want to know how I know

03:36.184 --> 03:38.351
you're such a badass? Because
you ride a Razor scooter.

03:38.370 --> 03:41.688
Nothing says "I'm a badass"
like a Razor scooter.

03:41.706 --> 03:43.624
Guys, please, don't do this.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.026
It... this is...
this is stupid. Stop.

03:46.044 --> 03:47.828
Hey, hey, cut it out.

03:47.862 --> 03:49.196
Stop. Come on, stop, stop it.

03:49.214 --> 03:50.530
Stop. Cut it out.
Come on.

03:50.548 --> 03:53.133
I persuade you
to stop fighting immediately.

03:53.168 --> 03:54.534
Freeze, bitches.

03:54.552 --> 03:55.535
FINN:
Thanks, Becky,

03:55.553 --> 03:57.537
both you guys.

03:57.555 --> 03:59.372
Glee Club, 20 minutes.

03:59.391 --> 04:01.374
(school bell ringing)

04:01.393 --> 04:03.394
(indistinct chatter)

04:06.881 --> 04:08.849
(laughter)

04:08.883 --> 04:11.384
Okay, guys, sit down. We got
a lot of work to do today.

04:11.403 --> 04:12.686
(indistinct chatter)

04:12.720 --> 04:14.405
No, seriously, come on,
I mean it, sit down.

04:15.740 --> 04:18.725
Okay, so the first
order of business today

04:18.743 --> 04:20.661
is to welcome the newest members
to the glee club...

04:20.695 --> 04:23.163
Ryder and Kitty.
(cheering and applause)

04:23.198 --> 04:25.532
Wait, don't we all get
to vote on her or something?

04:25.566 --> 04:28.068
Well, Tina,
Kitty was fantastic in <i>Grease.</i>

04:28.086 --> 04:29.569
In spite of my god-awful part.

04:29.587 --> 04:31.171
Besides, we're under the gun.

04:31.206 --> 04:32.673
We... we have to go
to Sectionals next week

04:32.707 --> 04:34.541
and we need 12 members
to compete.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.909
Oh, well, then,
just call Santana back

04:35.927 --> 04:37.845
from Kentucky again
'cause apparently she's better

04:37.879 --> 04:39.179
than anyone who's actually
enrolled here.

04:39.214 --> 04:40.413
Look, Tina, not now.

04:40.432 --> 04:41.748
Uh, look, where was I?

04:41.766 --> 04:43.583
Sectionals, yes.

04:43.601 --> 04:45.102
Here's the game plan.

04:47.088 --> 04:49.089
Broke the marker.

04:50.225 --> 04:51.775
Where does Mr. Shue keep
the other markers?

04:52.927 --> 04:54.695
Uh...

04:57.431 --> 04:58.899
Screw it. Uh...

05:01.953 --> 05:04.371
The theme is "Foreigner."

05:04.405 --> 05:08.041
We're gonna sing songs by
Foreigner in foreign languages,

05:08.076 --> 05:10.711
wearing all the costumes
of the world's nations.

05:14.132 --> 05:15.582
Wait, seriously,
that's your idea?

05:15.616 --> 05:16.583
Yeah.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.418
Kiki, what do you think?

05:18.452 --> 05:20.254
FEMALE VOICE: I think I'm
alive and you're the machine.

05:20.288 --> 05:22.455
BLAINE:
Finn, times have changed.

05:22.474 --> 05:24.057
We're national champions
now, which means

05:24.092 --> 05:26.393
we have to exceed all
expectations, so if that's

05:26.427 --> 05:30.964
your best idea, I... I don't
think we stand a chance.

05:30.982 --> 05:32.799
Wait, where are you going?

05:32.817 --> 05:36.303
I'm going to get our trophy back
from the Warblers...

05:36.321 --> 05:38.638
the one you haven't even noticed
is missing.

05:40.992 --> 05:42.442
Crap, uh...

05:42.476 --> 05:45.412
<i>So, who exactly</i>
<i>are you supposed to be?</i>

05:45.446 --> 05:47.447
I'm the Beiste Master.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.481
Blaine said

05:48.500 --> 05:49.983
I couldn't be faculty advisor

05:50.001 --> 05:51.318
unless I dressed up once a week,

05:51.336 --> 05:53.486
so I'm from
the planet Testostergen,

05:53.505 --> 05:54.755
I can digest any
known substance

05:54.789 --> 05:57.124
and cry at the drop of a hat,

05:57.158 --> 05:58.792
and, hey, I'm not kidding
about that last part.

05:58.826 --> 06:01.428
Last night I teared up
at an Activia commercial.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.429
(chuckles)

06:02.463 --> 06:03.997
This is just all so ridiculous.

06:04.015 --> 06:06.266
Oh, come on, pumpkin,
this is fun.

06:06.301 --> 06:07.634
Yeah, it's no wonder
superheroes

06:07.668 --> 06:08.969
are all the rage.

06:09.003 --> 06:10.888
Putting on a mask
is like getting up onstage.

06:10.939 --> 06:12.339
It gives you the freedom to be

06:12.357 --> 06:14.674
the person
you secretly aspire to be,

06:14.692 --> 06:17.978
and if you ask me, the world
could use a few more heroes.

06:18.012 --> 06:19.530
(school bell ringing)
So, what's bugging you, kiddo?

06:19.564 --> 06:20.697
You seem blue.

06:20.732 --> 06:22.349
It was my first lesson
in Glee Club today,

06:22.367 --> 06:23.617
and it was a total disaster.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.852
What happened?
I don't know.

06:25.870 --> 06:27.020
I mean, the lesson
that I planned

06:27.038 --> 06:28.021
was awesome.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.323
I... I think
it's just that the...

06:29.357 --> 06:31.358
the glee club doesn't see me
as an adult.

06:31.376 --> 06:33.994
(groans)

06:34.028 --> 06:35.462
God, is that
what coffee tastes like?

06:35.496 --> 06:36.863
How do people drink that?

06:36.881 --> 06:38.081
I'm just spitballing here,

06:38.132 --> 06:40.033
but maybe you should invest
in a pair of tights.

06:40.051 --> 06:42.002
You know, Clark Kent
was an awesome guy,

06:42.036 --> 06:45.372
but it was Superman
who inspired everyone.

06:45.390 --> 06:47.474
Be their hero, Finn.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.509
I'm just saying.

06:51.896 --> 06:54.698
(bell clanging)

06:56.717 --> 06:58.819
Sebastian.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.220
Of course it was you.

07:00.238 --> 07:02.689
No, it wasn't, I swear.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.942
I turned over a new leaf,
remember?

07:04.993 --> 07:08.028
No more bullying, blackmail
or assault this year.

07:08.062 --> 07:09.830
That must be boring for you.

07:09.864 --> 07:13.083
Yeah, it is;
Being nice sucks.

07:14.402 --> 07:16.569
He's waiting for you
in the library.

07:16.588 --> 07:18.071
Who is?

07:18.089 --> 07:20.374
The guy you're here to see.

07:20.408 --> 07:21.574
Captain of the Warblers.

07:21.593 --> 07:24.678
I thought you were captain
of the Warblers.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.088
I knew they'd send you.

07:35.106 --> 07:38.091
Allow me to answer
the obvious questions.

07:38.109 --> 07:41.862
I'm Hunter Clarington, I am
the new captain of the Warblers,

07:41.896 --> 07:43.697
and I'm not even
remotely bi-curious.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.065
How are you captain
of the Warblers when...?

07:45.099 --> 07:46.933
When you've never
seen me before?

07:46.951 --> 07:49.486
Simple.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.204
Dalton just gave me
a full scholarship

07:51.239 --> 07:53.106
to move here
from Colorado Springs,

07:53.124 --> 07:55.192
where I led
my military academy choir

07:55.226 --> 07:56.776
to a Regionals victory

07:56.794 --> 07:58.996
with presidential honors.

07:59.047 --> 08:01.882
Now I'm here to kick it up a
notch, and that starts with you.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.083
That's very intimidating.

08:03.117 --> 08:04.451
Where's the trophy, Hunter?

08:04.485 --> 08:06.336
(chuckles)

08:06.387 --> 08:07.971
Don't worry, it's safe.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.059
It was just bait after all.

08:12.093 --> 08:13.560
See, you're kind of

08:13.594 --> 08:14.728
a legend here.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.896
I like that.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.230
So here's my offer:

08:17.265 --> 08:18.682
Your little diversity club

08:18.733 --> 08:20.934
can have its
Nationals trophy back

08:20.968 --> 08:22.402
when you rejoin the Warblers.

08:22.437 --> 08:25.272
And why would
I ever leave McKinley?

08:25.306 --> 08:26.406
Why would you stay?

08:26.441 --> 08:28.275
I heard you only went there
to be with Kurt,

08:28.309 --> 08:29.409
right?

08:29.444 --> 08:30.444
In fact,

08:30.478 --> 08:34.948
I hear they even call you
Blaine Warbler.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.950
They know you don't
belong there,

08:36.984 --> 08:38.802
so why don't you?
SEBASTIAN: We all know

08:38.836 --> 08:41.254
the real Blaine, Blaine...

08:41.289 --> 08:44.157
ambitious, driven.

08:44.174 --> 08:45.492
You're a Dalton boy.

08:45.510 --> 08:47.660
Present the blazer.

08:50.131 --> 08:52.099
That's not going to work on me.
Then why be afraid

08:52.133 --> 08:53.350
to try it on?

09:03.695 --> 09:05.678
Here's the thing, Blaine.

09:05.697 --> 09:08.315
You know that Nationals
trophy was a fluke,

09:08.349 --> 09:12.319
just like you know we're
going to win at Sectionals.

09:12.353 --> 09:16.123
Now, I don't want to see
a Dalton legend like you

09:16.157 --> 09:19.025
sidelined in his senior year.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.996
I want you on the winning side,

09:23.030 --> 09:25.082
here with us.

09:25.133 --> 09:27.968
You know what goes great
with a new Dalton blazer?

09:28.002 --> 09:29.702
An impromptu song.

09:29.721 --> 09:32.305
What? No, no. Oh, come on, one
song for your old buddies.

09:32.340 --> 09:34.207
Guys, I didn't come here
to sing a song.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.893
(vocalizing and whistling
Kelly Clarkson's "Dark Side")

09:41.232 --> 09:42.882
âª Oh, oh-oh

09:42.900 --> 09:44.818
âª <i>Will you love,</i>
<i>will you love, will you love?</i> âª

09:44.852 --> 09:47.354
âª Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
âª <i>Will you love?</i> âª

09:47.388 --> 09:48.721
âª <i>Will you love,</i>
<i>will you love?</i> âª

09:48.740 --> 09:52.659
âª There's a place

09:52.693 --> 09:54.745
âª That I know

09:56.414 --> 09:58.865
âª It's not pretty there

09:58.899 --> 10:02.502
âª And few have ever gone

10:04.088 --> 10:07.907
âª And if I show it to you now

10:07.925 --> 10:11.711
âª Will it make you run away

10:11.745 --> 10:14.881
âª Or will you stay?

10:14.915 --> 10:19.719
âª Even if it hurts

10:19.753 --> 10:22.355
âª Even if I try
to push you out âª

10:22.390 --> 10:26.226
âª Will you return

10:26.260 --> 10:30.930
âª And remind me
who I really am? âª

10:30.948 --> 10:35.368
âª Please remind me
who I really am âª

10:35.403 --> 10:39.272
âª Everybody's got a dark side

10:39.290 --> 10:41.041
âª Do you love me?

10:41.075 --> 10:43.776
âª Can you love mine?

10:43.795 --> 10:46.913
âª Nobody's a picture perfect

10:46.947 --> 10:50.617
âª But we're worth it,
you know that we're worth it âª

10:50.635 --> 10:54.621
âª Will you love me? âª <i>Will you love,
will you love, will you love?</i> âª

10:54.639 --> 10:57.624
âª Even with my dark side? âª
<i>Will you love, will you love?</i> âª

10:57.642 --> 10:59.292
âª <i>Will you love?</i> âª

10:59.310 --> 11:02.762
âª Don't run away,
don't run away âª

11:02.796 --> 11:04.797
âª <i>Don't run away</i> âª

11:04.816 --> 11:08.968
âª Just promise me you will stay
âª
âª <i>Promise me you will stay</i> âª

11:08.986 --> 11:10.604
âª Promise me you will stay âª

11:10.638 --> 11:14.140
âª <i>Promise me you will stay</i> âª

11:14.158 --> 11:17.310
âª Will you love me

11:17.328 --> 11:20.813
âª With my dark side?

11:20.832 --> 11:22.616
âª Oh, whoa

11:22.650 --> 11:25.318
âª Everybody's got a dark side

11:25.336 --> 11:27.287
âª Do you love me?

11:27.321 --> 11:30.323
âª Can you love mine?

11:30.341 --> 11:33.260
âª Nobody's a picture perfect

11:33.294 --> 11:37.097
âª But we're worth it,
you know that we're worth it âª

11:37.131 --> 11:40.667
âª Will you love me? âª <i>Will you love,
will you love, will you love?</i> âª

11:40.685 --> 11:45.672
âª Even with my dark side? âª <i>Will you
love, will you love, will you love?</i> âª

11:45.690 --> 11:48.475
âª Don't run away

11:48.509 --> 11:53.280
âª Don't run away.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.015
SEBASTIAN:
What'd I tell you?

11:56.033 --> 11:57.484
Flawless.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.454
Keep it.

12:01.489 --> 12:03.290
It's already yours.

12:03.324 --> 12:05.959
Don't you think it's time you
came back where you belong...

12:05.993 --> 12:07.377
Blaine Warbler?

12:12.146 --> 12:14.638
(school bell rings)

12:14.656 --> 12:16.307
Okay.

12:17.326 --> 12:18.809
Oh, dear God.

12:18.827 --> 12:21.312
So, I-I get it...
my first idea was pretty bad.

12:21.330 --> 12:23.147
Worse than funk. Worse
than "Night of Neglect."

12:23.165 --> 12:26.317
So... I decided to try
something new... "Dynamic..."

12:26.335 --> 12:27.484
Duets."

12:27.502 --> 12:29.437
This is gonna be
a lot more fun,

12:29.471 --> 12:31.956
and it focuses on something
you guys actually like:

12:31.990 --> 12:33.657
Superheroes. MARLEY:
Oh, so wait...

12:33.675 --> 12:35.452
are we all gonna
have to wear costumes?

12:35.487 --> 12:37.971
ARTIE: And who exactly
are you supposed to be?

12:37.989 --> 12:39.306
The Bulge, who makes
gym socks disappear?

12:39.324 --> 12:41.308
BRITTANY: Please don't melt us
with your bulge.

12:41.326 --> 12:43.744
Well, I am...
the almighty Treble Clef,

12:43.779 --> 12:45.279
Uniter of Glee Clubs.

12:45.313 --> 12:47.581
KITTY: Jesus is the only
real almighty superhero.

12:47.616 --> 12:49.149
Amen.
Nobody asked you.

12:49.167 --> 12:50.484
Come on, guys,

12:50.502 --> 12:51.919
let's hear him out.
Thanks.

12:51.953 --> 12:53.487
(Finn sighs)

12:53.505 --> 12:54.955
Look at the Avengers.

12:54.989 --> 12:57.491
Individually, they all have
amazing powers, but...

12:57.509 --> 12:59.326
as a team,
they cannot be stopped.

12:59.344 --> 13:00.795
Right now, we're a
bunch of individuals

13:00.829 --> 13:03.997
with great powers and talents,
but... we're not a team.

13:04.015 --> 13:05.266
Some of you even have

13:05.300 --> 13:06.834
mortal enemies
in this very room,

13:06.852 --> 13:08.836
allowing the Dark Side

13:08.854 --> 13:10.437
to turn us against
each other, when we

13:10.472 --> 13:11.605
should be focused
on the Warblers.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.340
Nightbird is handling
the missing trophy.

13:13.358 --> 13:15.142
Great. Thank you, Nightbird.

13:15.176 --> 13:17.144
Jake will pair up with Ryder,

13:17.178 --> 13:19.480
Marley will join Kitty
to perform the duets.

13:19.514 --> 13:20.481
The rest of you,

13:20.515 --> 13:22.015
start preparing to fight

13:22.033 --> 13:24.985
an epic battle against the
forces of evil at Sectionals.

13:25.020 --> 13:27.955
(cheering, whooping)

13:27.989 --> 13:29.523
That idea was slightly better.

13:29.541 --> 13:30.958
Still could be horrible.

13:30.992 --> 13:32.693
(fanfare plays)

13:32.711 --> 13:35.329
(school bell rings)

13:35.363 --> 13:37.197
Here's the only thing you need to study.
Isn't part

13:37.215 --> 13:39.466
of the assignment that we
have to pick a song together?

13:39.501 --> 13:40.835
The assignment is
"Dynamic Duets."

13:40.869 --> 13:42.002
I took the liberty of choosing

13:42.036 --> 13:44.138
a song to show off
my vocal bombasity while

13:44.172 --> 13:46.173
at the same time highlighting
your mousy softness.

13:46.207 --> 13:47.758
Well, can we at least talk about

13:47.809 --> 13:49.042
which superheroes
we're gonna be?

13:49.060 --> 13:50.811
You can talk all you want,
but I already decided.

13:50.846 --> 13:54.148
I'm Femme Fatale... 'cause in
French, that means: "Kill Women."

13:54.182 --> 13:55.316
No, it doesn't.
Which is what

13:55.350 --> 13:57.568
I'm going to do
when we perform.

14:00.405 --> 14:01.722
Okay.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.357
Let's be honest,
I don't like you,

14:03.391 --> 14:04.892
you don't like me,
and dressing up

14:04.910 --> 14:06.861
in a cape and tights...
not gonna change that.

14:06.895 --> 14:09.663
Fine. Don't do it, and get
booted out of Glee Club.

14:09.698 --> 14:11.532
Mega Stud won't complain.

14:11.566 --> 14:13.667
Hold-hold on.
Did you seriously

14:13.702 --> 14:15.669
just call yourself "Mega Stud"?

14:15.704 --> 14:18.873
It's my alter ego. So your
superhero choice is to be me?

14:18.907 --> 14:21.742
There can be only one.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.677
âª

14:28.216 --> 14:30.083
âª I am âª I am

14:30.101 --> 14:33.220
âª I am Superman

14:33.254 --> 14:37.424
âª And I know what's happening

14:37.442 --> 14:39.259
âª I am âª I am

14:39.277 --> 14:41.562
âª I am Superman

14:41.596 --> 14:43.263
âª And I can

14:43.281 --> 14:45.265
âª Do anything

14:46.401 --> 14:47.935
âª You don't

14:47.953 --> 14:50.404
âª Really love that guy

14:50.438 --> 14:54.942
âª You make it with,
now, do you? âª

14:54.960 --> 14:57.211
âª I know you don't love

14:57.245 --> 15:01.615
âª That guy, 'cause
I can see right through you âª

15:01.633 --> 15:04.451
I am âª
âª I am

15:04.469 --> 15:06.587
âª I am Superman

15:06.621 --> 15:07.755
âª And I know

15:07.789 --> 15:10.290
âª What's happening

15:11.927 --> 15:13.594
âª I am âª I am

15:13.628 --> 15:16.463
âª I am Superman

15:16.481 --> 15:20.300
âª And I can do anything

15:20.318 --> 15:22.186
Isn't MS a degenerative
nerve disease?

15:22.237 --> 15:24.638
I thought it was
a girl's magazine.

15:24.656 --> 15:25.973
âª If you

15:25.991 --> 15:29.109
âª Go a million miles away

15:29.143 --> 15:32.746
âª I'll track you down, girl

15:32.781 --> 15:35.315
âª Trust me when I say

15:35.333 --> 15:37.451
âª I know the pathway

15:37.485 --> 15:40.170
âª To your heart...

15:41.656 --> 15:43.156
FINN: Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing! Hey!

15:43.174 --> 15:44.825
Stop it!

15:44.843 --> 15:47.628
(screaming, shouting)

15:47.662 --> 15:48.495
Finn, do something!

15:48.513 --> 15:51.665
FINN:
Uh... Hey! Hey!

15:51.683 --> 15:54.802
Hey, hey, what's wrong
with you guys?

15:54.836 --> 15:57.471
SAM:
Full nelson, full nelson.

15:57.505 --> 15:59.506
You're not too
tough now, are you?

15:59.524 --> 16:01.508
My goal was
to bring you two together,

16:01.526 --> 16:03.444
not to have you dress up and...

16:03.478 --> 16:05.312
karate-chop each other
in the face!

16:05.346 --> 16:07.014
It was a lame exercise.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.650
No, you know what's lame?
Not winning at Sectionals.

16:09.684 --> 16:12.619
And if we don't get our act
together, we're gonna lose,

16:12.654 --> 16:13.821
and then that's gonna be it.

16:13.855 --> 16:15.355
I need you two to get along.

16:15.373 --> 16:17.458
I heard you, Finn,
but I don't like this guy.

16:17.492 --> 16:19.460
He's working his way through
every girl at this school,

16:19.494 --> 16:21.028
and I think Marley deserves better.
You have

16:21.046 --> 16:22.362
no idea what Marley wants,

16:22.380 --> 16:23.630
or deserves. FINN: Enough!

16:23.665 --> 16:25.165
Okay? Enough.
Clearly, you did not

16:25.199 --> 16:26.533
take anything
from my last assignment,

16:26.551 --> 16:28.302
so I'm gonna give you a new one.

16:28.336 --> 16:29.386
Will it also be lame?

16:29.421 --> 16:31.972
Ignoring you. It's
a "Kryptonite Lesson."

16:32.007 --> 16:33.474
You two think
you hate each other.

16:33.508 --> 16:35.175
I think you don't
understand each other.

16:35.209 --> 16:36.643
So I want you to sit

16:36.678 --> 16:38.879
in a room and tell each other
your deepest fears.

16:38.897 --> 16:40.047
Only by

16:40.065 --> 16:41.214
admitting your weaknesses

16:41.232 --> 16:42.716
can you realize your strengths.

16:42.734 --> 16:44.318
You sound like Yoda, dude.

16:44.352 --> 16:46.219
Deal do we have?

16:49.024 --> 16:50.724
(fanfare plays)

16:50.759 --> 16:52.576
(school bell rings)

16:56.081 --> 16:58.732
Hey. You got a minute?
Yeah.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.035
Dude, I was just gonna text you.
How is Operation:

17:01.069 --> 17:02.569
Rescue/Recovery going?
Well, when

17:02.587 --> 17:04.505
I went back to Dalton,
all those blazers

17:04.539 --> 17:05.906
and singing with
the Warblers again...

17:05.924 --> 17:08.742
Wait, wait, what, you
sang with the Warblers?

17:08.760 --> 17:11.178
It just sort of happened.
But they embraced me

17:11.212 --> 17:12.846
like I was a long-lost brother.

17:12.881 --> 17:14.080
It was like

17:14.098 --> 17:15.749
in <i>X-Men 2,</i>
when Pyro left the X-Men

17:15.767 --> 17:16.884
to join Magneto's Brotherhood.

17:16.917 --> 17:18.852
It-it just felt right,

17:18.887 --> 17:20.436
like maybe...

17:21.772 --> 17:23.223
...I belong with the Warblers.
Dude,

17:23.257 --> 17:27.394
no, no, you belong
here, with us, okay?

17:27.428 --> 17:29.262
Does this have to do with Kurt?

17:29.280 --> 17:31.565
Everything in this room
reminds me of him.

17:31.599 --> 17:33.867
We were...
a dynamic duo in here.

17:33.902 --> 17:35.769
Kurt was my anchor, Finn,

17:35.787 --> 17:37.270
and now that he's
gone, I just...

17:37.288 --> 17:39.439
I feel like I'm floating.

17:39.457 --> 17:41.041
And you, you need a team

17:41.076 --> 17:42.910
that's gonna gel.
Yes. Absolutely.

17:42.944 --> 17:45.212
We need a team
with a lot of gel.

17:45.246 --> 17:48.048
And... you're, like,
the biggest part of that.

17:48.083 --> 17:51.618
I'm sorry, Finn, but the
Warblers are my birthright...

17:51.636 --> 17:53.554
and my destiny.

18:00.968 --> 18:04.540
(school bell rings)

18:04.574 --> 18:06.659
I can't do a duet with you.
Because my singing voice

18:06.693 --> 18:08.294
is crystal-clear
and you sort of sound like

18:08.328 --> 18:10.713
you've got a snot bubble stuck
in the back of your throat?

18:10.747 --> 18:12.531
What? No.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.199
I don't think that... that's just
what everyone's saying.

18:14.217 --> 18:17.219
Look... the reason
I can't do the duet

18:17.254 --> 18:19.037
is because of the costume.

18:19.055 --> 18:20.872
I can't wear a
head-to-toe body suit

18:20.891 --> 18:22.174
made out of clingy fabric.

18:22.208 --> 18:23.392
I'm too self-conscious.

18:23.426 --> 18:24.876
I'm gonna ask you a question,

18:24.895 --> 18:27.062
and I want you
to answer me honestly.

18:27.097 --> 18:30.716
Are you still driving
the bus to Puketown?

18:30.734 --> 18:32.234
What?
You know.

18:32.269 --> 18:33.903
Are you still giving yourself

18:33.937 --> 18:37.239
self-inflicted
barf-wounds to the uvula?

18:37.274 --> 18:38.908
I've done it
every day this week.

18:38.942 --> 18:40.859
You know, you and I
are a lot alike.

18:40.893 --> 18:43.862
I think that's why I was so
mean to you when we first met.

18:43.896 --> 18:46.081
I've had body-image issues,
too, but my good friends,

18:46.116 --> 18:48.417
the finger sisters,
Pointy and Birdie,

18:48.451 --> 18:51.587
helped me keep the trim figure
I retain to this day.

18:51.621 --> 18:53.255
Sweetie...

18:53.290 --> 18:55.374
you have to trust me
on this... we'll try on

18:55.408 --> 18:57.259
our costumes, and I swear,
if you look fat

18:57.294 --> 18:58.594
even a little bit,
I'll be honest,

18:58.628 --> 19:00.095
and we'll cancel
the performance, okay?

19:00.130 --> 19:02.247
Okay.

19:02.265 --> 19:04.717
Promise?
Promise.

19:09.739 --> 19:11.440
(fanfare plays)

19:11.474 --> 19:16.762
When Gotham is ashes, then
you have my permission to die.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.614
Good to know, Bane.
Is that a jockstrap?

19:18.648 --> 19:20.449
Let the games begin!

19:27.157 --> 19:29.941
What's this? What Finn
wanted us to talk about.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.294
My Kryptonite.

19:32.329 --> 19:35.914
Don't just hand me some
lame note... be a man,

19:35.948 --> 19:38.283
tell me face-to-face.

19:38.301 --> 19:41.754
My whole life,
I've never felt like I fit in.

19:41.788 --> 19:43.455
Not anywhere.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.623
Why?

19:44.641 --> 19:46.792
I'm half white,
half black, half Jewish.

19:46.810 --> 19:47.926
And just in case

19:47.960 --> 19:49.094
I forget...

19:49.128 --> 19:51.480
someone always reminds me.

19:51.514 --> 19:53.965
Brah, I got
a really good black joke,

19:53.984 --> 19:56.485
and since you're half black,
you can half listen.

19:56.519 --> 19:57.987
(laughing)

19:58.021 --> 20:00.489
Hey! Baruch Obamastein!

20:00.523 --> 20:02.825
What are you exactly?
You a Oreo,

20:02.859 --> 20:05.494
or a lightly toasted cracker?

20:05.528 --> 20:06.829
Shalom!

20:06.863 --> 20:09.198
So, what's <i>your</i> Kryptonite?

20:10.667 --> 20:12.651
You know what, forget it.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.170
This whole thing was stupid.

20:15.205 --> 20:17.289
JAKE:
Dude, you just told me to be

20:17.323 --> 20:19.124
a man, so are you
gonna be a man,

20:19.158 --> 20:21.493
or are you just
gonna walk away?

20:23.996 --> 20:26.131
I made you tell me
what your note said,

20:26.165 --> 20:28.333
'cause I couldn't read it.

20:32.722 --> 20:34.189
(school bell rings)

20:34.224 --> 20:37.643
Meow. Well, I don't know
about you, but this kitty cat's

20:37.677 --> 20:39.478
feeling so much yummier
now that she's

20:39.512 --> 20:42.865
slipped into her tightest outfit
as Femme Fatale.

20:42.899 --> 20:44.850
I'm waiting.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.286
MARLEY:
I can't. I look ridiculous.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.072
I'm sure that's not true.
Come on, I won't judge.

20:53.493 --> 20:55.711
Uncross your arms.

20:55.745 --> 20:59.531
I don't get it. What's WF? It's
supposed to be Wallflower.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.133
Wallflower?
Your alter ego's

21:01.167 --> 21:03.218
supposed to reflect how you
feel about yourself, right?

21:03.253 --> 21:04.369
When I looked in the mirror,

21:04.387 --> 21:05.721
this is what I saw.

21:05.755 --> 21:07.556
Well, get over here,
so Femme Fatale

21:07.590 --> 21:09.374
can tell you what <i>she</i> sees.

21:09.392 --> 21:11.209
Stand up straight.
Shoulders back.

21:11.227 --> 21:13.312
You look H-O-T-T, hot.

21:13.346 --> 21:14.880
I do?
Now,

21:14.898 --> 21:16.565
your clothes...
your mom made this, right,

21:16.599 --> 21:18.383
like she does
most of your stuff?

21:18.401 --> 21:20.069
Uh-huh. Well, bless her clogged,

21:20.103 --> 21:22.488
overworked heart, but from now
on, I'm buying your clothes,

21:22.522 --> 21:24.656
and they're gonna show off
your bitchin' bod.

21:24.691 --> 21:26.075
But first things first.

21:26.109 --> 21:29.060
Marley Rose, you are
Wallflower no more.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.395
You are Woman Fierce,

21:30.413 --> 21:33.999
and we are going
to kill this song.

21:34.033 --> 21:35.734
(laughs)

21:35.752 --> 21:38.069
(Bonnie Tyler's
"Holding Out for a Hero" begins)

21:41.624 --> 21:44.760
âª Where have all
the good men gone? âª

21:44.794 --> 21:47.412
âª And where are all the gods?

21:47.430 --> 21:50.432
âª Where's
the streetwise Hercules âª

21:50.467 --> 21:54.770
âª To fight the rising odds?

21:54.804 --> 21:57.255
âª Isn't there a white knight

21:57.273 --> 22:00.442
âª Upon a fiery steed?

22:00.477 --> 22:03.445
âª Late at night
I toss and I turn âª

22:03.480 --> 22:06.615
âª And I dream of what I need

22:06.649 --> 22:08.951
âª I need a hero

22:08.985 --> 22:13.539
âª I'm holding out for a hero
till the end of the night âª

22:13.573 --> 22:16.441
âª He's got to be strong
and he's got to be fast âª

22:16.459 --> 22:19.110
âª And he's got to be fresh
from the fight âª

22:19.129 --> 22:21.613
âª I need a hero

22:21.631 --> 22:25.951
âª I'm holding out for a hero
till the morning light âª

22:25.969 --> 22:28.620
âª He's got to be sure
and it's got to be soon âª

22:28.638 --> 22:32.123
âª And he's got to be
larger than life âª

22:33.292 --> 22:36.145
âª I need a hero

22:36.179 --> 22:40.465
âª I'm holding out for a hero
till the end of the night âª

22:40.483 --> 22:44.069
âª Up where the mountains
meet the heavens above âª

22:44.103 --> 22:46.655
âª Up where the lightning
splits the sea âª

22:46.689 --> 22:51.743
âª I can feel his approach
like a fire in my blood âª

22:51.778 --> 22:54.079
âª <i>Like a fire in my blood</i> âª

22:54.113 --> 22:57.482
âª <i>Like a fire in my blood,</i>
<i>like a fire in my blood</i> âª

22:57.500 --> 23:00.169
âª <i>Like a fire in my blood</i> âª

23:00.203 --> 23:03.956
âª Oh, I need a hero

23:03.990 --> 23:07.158
âª I'm holding out for a hero
till the end of the night âª

23:07.177 --> 23:10.179
âª He's got to be strong
and he's got to be fast âª

23:10.213 --> 23:14.099
âª And he's got to be
fresh from the fight âª

23:14.133 --> 23:16.001
âª I need a hero.

23:16.019 --> 23:17.886
(cheering)

23:22.225 --> 23:23.692
FINN:
That was incredible.

23:23.726 --> 23:25.527
You worked so well together.

23:25.562 --> 23:27.529
Teamwork! Yeah!

23:27.564 --> 23:29.815
You guys, I don't smell
raspberry hair gel.

23:29.849 --> 23:31.533
Does anybody know
where Blaine Warbler is?

23:32.719 --> 23:34.019
Uh, well, as some of
you guys might know,

23:34.037 --> 23:35.654
uh, recently, Blaine has been

23:35.688 --> 23:37.155
going through a bit
of a rough time...

23:37.189 --> 23:39.524
Oh, boo-hoo. Get over it.
It's like a bad Lifetime movie.

23:39.542 --> 23:43.378
...and he's decided to finish
the rest of his senior year

23:43.413 --> 23:45.030
at Dalton Academy.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.552
He's been taken
by the Dark Side.

23:54.749 --> 23:56.373
(school bell ringing)

23:57.131 --> 23:57.844
Finn?

23:58.860 --> 24:00.807
There's something
I need to tell you about Ryder.

24:02.327 --> 24:05.005
(school bell ringing)

24:09.432 --> 24:11.266
What's going on here?

24:11.284 --> 24:12.401
I'm Mrs. Penkala.

24:12.435 --> 24:14.736
I'm the district
special education director.

24:14.770 --> 24:16.955
And Finn brought you here
so I can help you, Ryder.

24:16.990 --> 24:18.940
I don't need any help.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.543
I've made it this far on my own.

24:21.578 --> 24:23.245
Jake should've
kept his mouth shut.

24:23.279 --> 24:26.215
Dude, just-just
relax, okay?

24:26.249 --> 24:28.634
Don't you want to figure
out why you keep studying

24:28.668 --> 24:30.135
but you don't do any better?

24:30.169 --> 24:32.170
Just have a seat.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.811
Well, I read your file.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.480
And you'd be surprised
how often

24:41.514 --> 24:44.299
bright kids like you
who are struggling don't have

24:44.317 --> 24:45.484
any testing done.

24:45.518 --> 24:47.019
Even with conscientious parents.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.988
Don't be nervous.

24:50.023 --> 24:51.773
The great thing
about this test is

24:51.807 --> 24:53.825
there are no right
or wrong answers.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.745
I want you to say the numbers
in numerical order

24:56.779 --> 24:58.480
and the letters
in alphabetical order.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.332
Nine, one, T.

25:00.366 --> 25:02.984
Seven, two, F, K.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.338
Father.

25:06.372 --> 25:09.174
Minute.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.959
Pretty.

25:10.993 --> 25:12.678
(timer ticking)

25:12.712 --> 25:14.496
School.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.298
Then.

25:16.332 --> 25:18.467
Flowers.

25:18.501 --> 25:20.335
I don't know what that says.

25:20.353 --> 25:21.670
Try sounding it out.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.055
I can't.

25:24.557 --> 25:26.558
Fly.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.534
I-I can't read that.

25:37.737 --> 25:40.405
Uh, brown.

25:41.407 --> 25:42.541
Is that even a word?

25:42.575 --> 25:46.044
(timer continues ticking)

25:46.079 --> 25:47.379
(bell dings)

25:47.413 --> 25:49.381
Time's up.

25:52.251 --> 25:55.203
I don't know why this
stuff is so hard for me.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.222
Am I stupid?
No.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.707
You're actually very smart.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.593
(school bell ringing)

26:06.099 --> 26:08.717
It's not a brain tumor, is it?
No.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.104
Uh, I'm dyslexic.

26:13.272 --> 26:16.391
You know, do you
know what it's like

26:16.409 --> 26:18.226
to have a real secret identity?

26:18.244 --> 26:21.246
Not like Clark Kent
or Peter Parker,

26:21.280 --> 26:24.916
but to know inside you're not
who everyone thinks you are.

26:26.619 --> 26:30.905
My whole life, it's been, "Ryder
just needs to apply himself."

26:30.923 --> 26:32.708
"Ryder's smart; he just
needs to work harder,

26:32.742 --> 26:35.744
focus, get it
together, man up."

26:39.298 --> 26:41.600
But inside, man, I knew
they were all wrong.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.935
It didn't matter
how hard I focused

26:43.970 --> 26:46.104
or how hard I worked;
I was stupid.

26:46.139 --> 26:49.474
And if anyone ever found that
out, if they knew the real me...

26:54.480 --> 26:57.098
I was... I was sure it
would've killed my parents.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.034
Man, and my dad's
a freaking PhD.

26:59.068 --> 27:01.703
How is he gonna feel about
having an idiot for a son?

27:01.738 --> 27:03.288
I'm sure your dad
loves you no matter what.

27:03.322 --> 27:07.292
Dude, you learn to
read when you're six.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.378
When you're six;
That's first grade.

27:09.412 --> 27:10.945
Then they separate you
into these levels.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.881
They don't tell you
that's what they're doing,

27:12.915 --> 27:14.616
but everyone knows
who's in the smart group

27:14.634 --> 27:16.635
and who's in the dumb one.

27:18.921 --> 27:20.288
You think a
six-year-old knows

27:20.306 --> 27:23.308
his dad's gonna love
him no matter what?

27:26.962 --> 27:28.930
I've been carrying...

27:28.964 --> 27:30.399
I've been carrying
this secret around

27:30.433 --> 27:31.933
my whole life, man,
all this time.

27:31.967 --> 27:35.270
Now you can put it down.

27:35.304 --> 27:36.772
Okay?

27:36.806 --> 27:39.941
'Cause the only secret
is that your brain works

27:39.975 --> 27:41.993
a little differently than
everyone else's, that's it.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.829
Okay?

27:43.863 --> 27:45.330
They're gonna start

27:45.364 --> 27:47.949
an individualized
education program for me.

27:47.983 --> 27:49.668
I'll start working
with a special teacher

27:49.702 --> 27:51.703
every day next week.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.425
Yeah, thank you.

27:56.459 --> 27:58.460
Thank you for helping me, Finn.

27:58.494 --> 27:59.795
I owe you.

27:59.829 --> 28:02.831
Actually, you owe Jake.

28:07.064 --> 28:08.989
(school bell ringing)

28:09.007 --> 28:10.591
Hey, Mrs. Rose.

28:10.625 --> 28:12.126
Hey.

28:12.160 --> 28:13.827
There is something
different about you.

28:14.256 --> 28:15.373
Is that a new hairnet?

28:15.407 --> 28:18.009
(laughing):
No, it's the same one.

28:18.043 --> 28:21.746
You know, tell you the truth,
I did lose a little weight.

28:21.764 --> 28:23.047
Six pounds this month.

28:23.081 --> 28:25.416
Well, I knew it was something.

28:25.434 --> 28:26.751
You look great.

28:26.769 --> 28:28.186
Thanks, Jake.

28:28.220 --> 28:30.054
Oh.

28:30.088 --> 28:32.423
Marley would kill me
for telling you this,

28:32.441 --> 28:34.893
but she talks about
you all the time.

28:34.927 --> 28:38.696
You know, I had my chance...

28:38.731 --> 28:40.365
and I blew it.

28:40.399 --> 28:42.367
Well, it's never too late
to change. Look at me.

28:42.401 --> 28:43.701
BOBBY:
Hey, Dump Truck,

28:43.736 --> 28:44.702
get back to work.

28:44.737 --> 28:46.604
What did you say to her?

28:46.622 --> 28:49.490
I believe he called her
a broken-down,

28:49.541 --> 28:51.042
ten-ton crap-filled dump truck.

28:51.911 --> 28:52.994
Oh, and your new name

28:53.045 --> 28:55.663
is officially Kosher Cappuccino.

28:55.714 --> 28:57.081
(laughs)

28:57.115 --> 28:59.450
You make this so easy when
there's only two of you.

28:59.468 --> 29:01.753
Why don't you count
again, sweetheart.

29:01.787 --> 29:02.921
It's payback time.

29:02.955 --> 29:04.055
RYDER:
Hey!

29:06.141 --> 29:07.225
Jake's my boy.

29:07.259 --> 29:08.393
From now on, you mess with him,

29:08.427 --> 29:09.594
you mess with me.

29:10.646 --> 29:11.963
And me.

29:11.981 --> 29:13.982
And me.
And me, too.

29:19.405 --> 29:20.738
Whatever.

29:20.773 --> 29:22.273
Better stuff to do anyway.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.530
What'd you do that for?

29:29.581 --> 29:32.149
You had my back.

29:33.118 --> 29:34.252
Now I've got yours.

29:48.467 --> 29:51.269
Excuse me. Uh, which superhero
are you supposed to be?

29:51.303 --> 29:52.387
Kidding me? I'm the Puckerman!

29:52.438 --> 29:53.471
Can we take photo, please?

29:53.505 --> 29:54.505
That'll be ten bucks.

29:54.523 --> 29:55.640
For 20, I'll clean your pool,

29:55.674 --> 29:57.275
and if you give me 100,
I'll give you

29:57.309 --> 29:58.943
the greatest night of your life.

29:58.978 --> 30:00.344
(both speaking French)

30:00.362 --> 30:02.397
<i>Un, deux, trois.</i>

30:02.448 --> 30:03.398
(camera clicks)

30:03.449 --> 30:05.233
<i>Voila!</i>
<i>Merci.</i>

30:05.284 --> 30:06.234
<i>Merci,</i> suckers.

30:06.285 --> 30:07.735
<i>Au revoir.</i>
All right.

30:07.786 --> 30:09.287
(cell phone vibrating)

30:11.023 --> 30:13.574
What's up,
half bro with the afro?

30:13.625 --> 30:14.993
Hey, man.

30:15.027 --> 30:16.861
Uh, where are you?
It sounds really loud.

30:16.879 --> 30:19.130
I'm just making some scratch
out on Hollywood Boulevard,

30:19.164 --> 30:21.966
aka the enormous skid mark
Los Angeles found in its undies.

30:22.001 --> 30:23.868
What's going on?
I need some brotherly advice.

30:23.886 --> 30:25.136
I'm all ears.

30:25.170 --> 30:27.005
Okay, what are you
supposed to do when you really

30:27.039 --> 30:28.306
like a girl, but you didn't
know it at first,

30:28.340 --> 30:29.474
then you sort of blew
your shot with her,

30:29.508 --> 30:31.676
and now this other dude's
really into her

30:31.710 --> 30:33.511
who you used to think
was a total poser,

30:33.545 --> 30:35.263
but turns out he's actually
a really cool guy

30:35.314 --> 30:37.548
who totally has your back,
and you know you'll be

30:37.566 --> 30:40.217
a world-class D-bag if you jump
in now and try to break them up?

30:40.235 --> 30:41.319
Whoa, whoa, whoa, back it up.

30:41.353 --> 30:43.237
Question: is she hot?

30:46.325 --> 30:47.658
Yeah.

30:47.693 --> 30:49.060
Uh, dude, you could say that.

30:49.078 --> 30:50.394
Got it.
All right, well, listen up.

30:50.412 --> 30:52.229
Play it cool.

30:52.247 --> 30:53.481
Unlike the rest
of those Lima losers,

30:53.515 --> 30:55.616
you have superior
Puckerman testosterone

30:55.667 --> 30:57.335
that's pumping those hallways
full of premium.

30:57.369 --> 30:58.736
Puckerman-brand pheromones.

30:58.754 --> 31:00.071
Just let her catch a whiff.

31:00.089 --> 31:01.873
Then you can sit back
and play nice.

31:01.907 --> 31:03.240
And in a couple weeks,

31:03.258 --> 31:04.959
I guarantee she'll be
begging for it.

31:05.010 --> 31:06.911
You really think
that's gonna work?

31:06.929 --> 31:08.629
Trust me. That's how
I bagged Teri Hatcher.

31:08.680 --> 31:10.247
Let me tell you,
she's not complaining.

31:10.265 --> 31:11.716
Listen, man, I got to go.

31:11.750 --> 31:13.634
Homeless guy just threw up
on Barbra Streisand's star.

31:13.685 --> 31:14.635
I got to snap a pic.

31:14.686 --> 31:16.220
But remember my advice:

31:16.254 --> 31:17.021
Don't be a dick...

31:17.056 --> 31:18.422
But don't give up.

31:18.440 --> 31:19.440
Thanks, bro.

31:24.279 --> 31:26.064
(school bell ringing)

31:31.286 --> 31:33.437
Dude, this is part of
some master plan, right?

31:33.455 --> 31:34.939
You're going back to the
Warblers to gather intel for us

31:34.957 --> 31:36.040
so we can kick their ass
at Sectionals.

31:36.075 --> 31:37.041
Sam, don't.

31:37.076 --> 31:38.209
I feel awful enough as it is.

31:38.243 --> 31:39.410
Stop, okay?
You've been beating yourself up

31:39.444 --> 31:41.245
for, like, weeks
since you and Kurt broke up.

31:41.279 --> 31:42.713
But going back to Dalton?

31:42.748 --> 31:44.715
You told Finn it was 'cause
you feel more at home there.

31:44.750 --> 31:46.117
If you ask me, it's just
another way to punish yourself.

31:46.135 --> 31:49.220
And for what?
What did you do, exactly?

31:49.254 --> 31:51.255
(panting)

31:57.146 --> 31:59.130
You okay?

31:59.148 --> 32:01.465
No.

32:01.483 --> 32:05.636
Is it because I don't look at
all like my profile picture?

32:05.654 --> 32:08.439
I'm sorry, I-I have to go.

32:08.473 --> 32:11.776
It was a guy that
friended me on Facebook.

32:11.810 --> 32:14.796
I went over to his place

32:14.830 --> 32:17.365
because it felt like Kurt
was moving on with his life

32:17.416 --> 32:19.617
and I wasn't a part of it.

32:19.651 --> 32:22.954
And I got to
thinking that maybe

32:22.988 --> 32:24.755
Kurt and I weren't
meant for each other.

32:24.790 --> 32:26.124
That we weren't
supposed to spend

32:26.158 --> 32:27.458
the rest of our lives together.

32:27.492 --> 32:30.828
But the horrible thing is,

32:30.846 --> 32:32.847
right after I did it...

32:35.184 --> 32:38.669
...I knew that we were.

32:38.687 --> 32:40.271
Dude, you got to
tell Kurt that.

32:40.305 --> 32:41.338
What, you think I
haven't told him that?

32:41.356 --> 32:42.339
You think I haven't tried?

32:42.357 --> 32:43.558
Calm down. It's okay.

32:43.609 --> 32:45.009
No, it's not okay, Sam,

32:45.027 --> 32:47.562
'cause I cheated
on the one person

32:47.613 --> 32:49.780
that I love more than
anything in this world.

32:49.815 --> 32:52.150
I hurt him, so of course
he's not gonna trust me.

32:52.184 --> 32:53.350
He's never gonna forgive me.

32:53.368 --> 32:55.186
Even if he doesn't,
you got to forgive yourself.

32:55.204 --> 32:57.521
You got to stop...

32:57.539 --> 33:00.491
What's-what's the word when
you make someone into a villain?

33:00.525 --> 33:01.859
Uh...

33:01.877 --> 33:03.694
Villainize?

33:03.712 --> 33:05.362
Yeah, you got to stop
villainizing yourself.

33:05.380 --> 33:07.632
Yeah, you hurt Kurt;
That wasn't cool.

33:07.666 --> 33:09.967
So you're trying
to make it right.

33:10.002 --> 33:13.204
But exiling yourself to Dalton
won't fix anything.

33:13.222 --> 33:17.541
I just want to
stop feeling like

33:17.559 --> 33:19.143
I'm a bad person.

33:19.178 --> 33:20.311
You're not.

33:20.345 --> 33:21.512
You're one of the good guys.

33:21.546 --> 33:23.881
And I got a whole glee club
that agrees with me.

33:23.899 --> 33:25.266
Give me a day.

33:25.317 --> 33:27.652
One day
before you pack it all up.

33:27.686 --> 33:31.388
One day... to be the hero
we all know you are.

33:31.406 --> 33:34.058
And then, you know, you can...

33:34.076 --> 33:36.244
decide where you really belong.

33:40.365 --> 33:43.367
(David Bowie's "Heroes" begins)

33:48.423 --> 33:51.075
âª I

33:51.093 --> 33:54.212
âª I wish I could swim

33:56.265 --> 33:59.750
âª Like the dolphins

33:59.768 --> 34:02.887
âª Like dolphins can swim

34:04.890 --> 34:07.525
âª Though nothing

34:07.559 --> 34:12.929
âª Nothing will keep us
together âª

34:12.947 --> 34:16.734
âª We can beat them

34:16.768 --> 34:21.656
âª Forever and ever

34:21.706 --> 34:25.576
âª Oh, we can be heroes

34:25.610 --> 34:29.045
âª Just for one day

34:30.614 --> 34:32.882
âª

34:39.623 --> 34:43.010
âª I

34:43.061 --> 34:45.313
âª I will be king

34:47.431 --> 34:50.101
âª And you

34:51.136 --> 34:53.603
âª You will be queen

34:56.658 --> 34:59.977
âª Though nothing

34:59.995 --> 35:02.113
âª Will drive them away

35:04.333 --> 35:06.000
âª We can be heroes

35:08.153 --> 35:10.821
âª Forever and ever

35:12.341 --> 35:14.842
âª Then we can be heroes

35:17.012 --> 35:19.347
âª Just for one day

35:42.537 --> 35:44.688
âª We can be heroes

35:50.879 --> 35:55.199
âª We can be heroes

35:55.217 --> 35:57.802
âª Just for one day.

36:04.976 --> 36:06.344
Well?

36:06.378 --> 36:07.345
What's your decision?

36:07.379 --> 36:09.096
(sighs)

36:09.147 --> 36:11.515
One last mission first.

36:12.550 --> 36:14.769
You in?

36:14.820 --> 36:15.853
(fanfare plays)

36:23.829 --> 36:26.397
(birds chirping)

36:26.415 --> 36:29.417
(jazzy superhero music playing)

36:41.846 --> 36:43.597
(school bell rings)

36:43.632 --> 36:44.965
Hey.

36:46.017 --> 36:47.834
Listen, I hate
to do this, but...

36:47.852 --> 36:49.553
I have to reschedule
our date on Friday.

36:49.604 --> 36:51.171
What?

36:51.189 --> 36:52.506
Wh-Why?

36:52.524 --> 36:53.474
I have to study.

36:55.610 --> 36:57.561
(clears throat) And, uh...

36:57.612 --> 36:59.980
I have my first appointment
with a dyslexia specialist

37:00.014 --> 37:02.566
on Saturday, and he's, like,
the best in Ohio, so he could

37:02.617 --> 37:03.901
only squeeze me in
at 7:00 a.m.,

37:03.952 --> 37:05.686
which means I have to go
straight home after the game.

37:06.705 --> 37:08.188
Well...

37:08.206 --> 37:10.157
I was really looking forward
to hanging out.

37:10.191 --> 37:11.742
Me, too. I-I just...

37:11.793 --> 37:13.627
It's really important.

37:13.662 --> 37:15.362
I want this to be
the first semester

37:15.380 --> 37:17.531
I hand my mom a report card
with an "A" on it.

37:18.550 --> 37:19.533
How about next Friday?

37:19.551 --> 37:20.584
Can we go out then?

37:20.635 --> 37:22.536
Sure.

37:22.554 --> 37:24.722
Awesome. Thanks.

37:26.341 --> 37:28.709
Ouch. That sounded like
the beginning of the end.

37:28.727 --> 37:31.378
What do you mean? "I can't go
out because I have to study"?

37:31.396 --> 37:35.048
Sounded an awful lot like "I'm
not that into you." Well,

37:35.066 --> 37:36.717
he has to get up early
to see a doctor.

37:36.735 --> 37:38.051
Is that what
it is? Or is it

37:38.069 --> 37:39.553
maybe all the yogurt-covered
raisins?

37:39.571 --> 37:41.221
Don't listen to what
everybody else is saying...

37:41.239 --> 37:42.523
I don't think
you look bloated at all.

37:42.557 --> 37:44.057
But if you want to
win his attention,

37:44.075 --> 37:45.859
you should really
hit the elliptical.

37:45.893 --> 37:47.061
Stat.

37:48.079 --> 37:49.896
You know what?

37:49.914 --> 37:51.215
The old Marley would
have sat home alone

37:51.249 --> 37:53.117
on a Friday night, but the new

37:53.168 --> 37:56.704
superheroine Marley's
not gonna wait around.

38:01.576 --> 38:02.743
Hi.

38:02.761 --> 38:04.077
What are you doing
Friday night?

38:04.095 --> 38:06.046
Uh...

38:06.080 --> 38:07.548
going on a date with you.

38:07.582 --> 38:09.099
Good.

38:11.186 --> 38:13.187
(sighs)

38:17.442 --> 38:18.726
SAM:
Guys, it was epic.

38:18.760 --> 38:19.926
Dalton was like Death Star

38:19.944 --> 38:22.062
meets Mordor meets
Temple of Doom.

38:22.096 --> 38:24.431
I mean, I might be
exaggerating, but probably not.

38:24.449 --> 38:26.233
I owe all of you an apology

38:26.267 --> 38:28.235
for ever doubting
McKinley's my home.

38:28.269 --> 38:29.603
You guys are my home.

38:29.621 --> 38:31.271
We've got a real fight
ahead of us

38:31.289 --> 38:32.573
with the Warblers
at Sectionals,

38:32.607 --> 38:34.241
but I am not worried at all.

38:34.275 --> 38:35.442
Because we've got the team,

38:35.460 --> 38:36.744
we've got the talent, and...

38:36.778 --> 38:38.111
we have,

38:38.129 --> 38:39.446
most importantly,

38:39.464 --> 38:41.749
the leader.

38:41.783 --> 38:42.949
(cheers and applause)

38:42.967 --> 38:44.635
Thank you.

38:46.954 --> 38:48.756
That's you, Finn!

38:48.790 --> 38:50.123
Go put that in the case.

38:51.476 --> 38:52.593
I love you, Finn!

38:55.980 --> 38:57.231
All right, all right,

38:57.265 --> 38:58.632
all right, all right,
all right.

38:58.650 --> 39:00.350
Let's start with some warm-ups,

39:00.402 --> 39:02.269
and then we can... Uh, Finn, wait.
Can I say something?

39:03.738 --> 39:06.106
This is for you,
from all of us.

39:06.140 --> 39:07.974
ARTIE: It's a superhero
utility belt

39:07.992 --> 39:09.476
cleverly disguised
as a fanny pack.

39:09.494 --> 39:11.361
There's some stuff in there
we thought you could use.

39:11.413 --> 39:13.980
Ah, cool, uh...

39:15.417 --> 39:17.000
Magic markers.
I could never find these.

39:19.421 --> 39:20.987
Antacid.
(chuckles)

39:21.005 --> 39:22.706
In case you get
the show choir squirts.

39:22.757 --> 39:24.675
Thanks.

39:29.681 --> 39:31.331
BRITTANY:
That's from me.

39:31.349 --> 39:32.999
You're welcome.

39:37.004 --> 39:38.171
BLAINE: That's to
always remind you

39:38.189 --> 39:40.340
that you're the almighty
Treble Clef,

39:40.358 --> 39:41.842
the Uniter of Glee Clubs.

39:41.860 --> 39:43.861
And the Uniter of Friends.

39:45.447 --> 39:46.897
Wow.

39:46.948 --> 39:48.849
Uh... I don't
know what to say.

39:48.867 --> 39:51.318
I'll never let you down.

39:51.352 --> 39:52.853
I promise.

39:52.871 --> 39:54.321
Okay, come on, huddle up.

39:54.355 --> 39:55.322
All right, let's huddle up.

39:55.356 --> 39:57.157
(Brittany squeals)

39:59.878 --> 40:02.162
Next week at Sectionals,

40:02.196 --> 40:05.198
we are gonna kick some
Warblers' sorry asses. Yes.

40:05.216 --> 40:07.701
And then it's Regionals,
and then it's Nationals,

40:07.719 --> 40:09.169
and then this year
is gonna go down

40:09.203 --> 40:10.804
in the McKinley High
record books

40:10.839 --> 40:14.007
as the greatest year the
New Directions! Has ever seen.

40:14.041 --> 40:15.759
Onwards and upwards!

40:15.810 --> 40:18.044
ALL:
Amazing!

40:18.062 --> 40:23.049
âª Some nights I stay up
cashing in my bad luck âª

40:23.067 --> 40:26.219
âª Some nights
I call it a draw âª

40:26.237 --> 40:31.057
âª Some nights I wish that
my lips could build a castle âª

40:31.075 --> 40:34.728
âª Some nights I wish
they'd just fall off âª

40:34.746 --> 40:39.783
âª But I still wake up,
I still see your ghost âª

40:39.834 --> 40:43.370
âª Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure
what I stand for âª

40:43.404 --> 40:47.073
âª Oh, what do I stand for?
âª <i>Oh, oh</i> âª

40:47.091 --> 40:48.876
âª What do I stand for?

40:48.910 --> 40:52.462
âª Most nights I don't know

40:52.514 --> 40:57.083
âª Anymore âª <i>Oh, whoa</i> âª

40:57.101 --> 41:00.854
âª <i>Oh, whoa, oh</i> âª

41:02.273 --> 41:04.975
âª This is it, boys,
this is war âª

41:05.026 --> 41:07.644
âª What are we waiting for?

41:07.695 --> 41:11.264
âª Why don't we break
the rules already? âª

41:11.282 --> 41:14.067
âª I was never one
to believe the hype âª

41:14.101 --> 41:16.436
âª Save that for the black
and white, try twice as hard âª

41:16.454 --> 41:17.771
âª And I'm half as liked

41:17.789 --> 41:19.573
âª But here they come again
to jack my style âª

41:19.607 --> 41:21.608
âª That's all right
âª That's all right

41:21.626 --> 41:24.511
âª I found a martyr
in my bed tonight âª

41:24.529 --> 41:27.347
âª Stops my bone
from wondering just âª

41:27.365 --> 41:30.567
âª Who I, who I am

41:30.618 --> 41:33.186
âª Oh, who am I?

41:33.204 --> 41:34.521
âª Mmm

41:34.539 --> 41:36.456
MARLEY:
âª Who am I?

41:36.491 --> 41:37.958
âª Who am I?
âª Well

41:37.992 --> 41:41.461
âª Some nights I wish
that this all would end âª

41:41.496 --> 41:46.300
âª 'Cause I could use
some friends for a change âª

41:46.334 --> 41:50.704
âª And some nights I'm scared
you'll forget me again âª

41:50.722 --> 41:54.708
âª Some nights I always win,
I always win âª

41:54.726 --> 41:57.477
âª But I still wake up

41:57.512 --> 42:01.648
âª I still see your ghost,
oh, Lord, I'm still not sure âª

42:01.683 --> 42:05.068
âª What I stand for, oh âª <i>Oh</i> âª

42:05.103 --> 42:06.987
âª What do I stand for?
âª <i>Oh</i> âª

42:07.021 --> 42:08.722
âª What do I stand for?

42:08.740 --> 42:12.726
âª Most nights I don't know

42:12.744 --> 42:13.893
âª Oh, come on

42:13.912 --> 42:15.395
JOE:
So, this is it?

42:15.413 --> 42:17.331
I sold my soul for this?

42:18.533 --> 42:20.233
Washed my hands
of that for this?

42:20.251 --> 42:22.169
I miss my mom and dad for this?

42:22.203 --> 42:27.007
âª So, come on âª Oh, come on

42:27.041 --> 42:29.242
âª Come on

42:29.260 --> 42:32.412
âª Oh, come on!

42:32.430 --> 42:37.184
âª <i>Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i> âª
âª Whoa, whoa, ooh

42:37.218 --> 42:41.188
âª <i>Oh</i> âª
âª Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

42:41.222 --> 42:43.190
âª The other night
you wouldn't believe âª

42:43.224 --> 42:45.442
âª The dream I just had
about you and me âª

42:45.476 --> 42:47.194
âª I called you up,
but we'd both agree âª

42:47.228 --> 42:50.864
âª Oh, come on!

42:50.898 --> 42:52.366
âª It's for the best
you didn't listen âª

42:52.400 --> 42:53.567
âª Oh

42:55.286 --> 42:58.705
âª It's for the best
we get our distance âª

42:58.740 --> 43:02.793
âª Oh, oh, whoa

43:02.827 --> 43:05.545
âª Oh, whoa, oh.

43:05.580 --> 43:07.214
(cheers and applause)
