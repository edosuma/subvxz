01:15.958 --> 01:17.166
Who can't be beat?

01:17.250 --> 01:18.250
A dead horse!

01:18.333 --> 01:20.625
- Who can't be beat?
- A dead horse!

01:20.708 --> 01:21.708
Who can't be beat?

01:21.791 --> 01:22.791
A dead horse!

01:22.875 --> 01:24.916
- Who can't be beat?
- A dead horse!

01:25.000 --> 01:27.666
"School spirit" is a curious term.

01:28.416 --> 01:33.666
The phrase might sound as if it refers
to a ghost or other undead phantasm

01:33.750 --> 01:39.625
haunting an educational establishment like
very old gum clinging to a trophy case.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.833
What "school spirit" actually refers to

01:43.916 --> 01:47.208
is the belief one particular school
is better than another.

01:47.291 --> 01:49.875
Our particular school
is better than others!

01:49.958 --> 01:52.666
Though, as the Baudelaires
were about to learn,

01:52.750 --> 01:55.375
there are worse things
that can haunt a school.

01:56.125 --> 01:59.833
I love the energy. I love it!

02:00.416 --> 02:03.000
- Okay, everyone, settle down.
- Settle down?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.875
Do you hear
what Vice Principal Shapiro just said?

02:06.958 --> 02:09.125
- Nero.
- "Settle down."

02:09.791 --> 02:14.041
How often I hear those words come out
of people's ears and into my mouth.

02:14.125 --> 02:19.500
"Settle," a word which here means
"settling for less,"

02:19.583 --> 02:23.416
and "down,"
my personal least favorite direction.

02:24.083 --> 02:25.833
Let me tell you a story.

02:25.916 --> 02:30.250
Some years ago, a woman came to me.
She needed my help.

02:30.333 --> 02:32.833
"Coach Genghis," she said to me,

02:32.916 --> 02:39.166
"I'm a failure. I have no job.
My love life is in the pits.

02:39.250 --> 02:42.541
I can't seem to lose
these last 20 pounds."

02:42.625 --> 02:45.375
I bet that describes
just about every one of you, am I right?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.875
- Um, they're schoolchildren.
- Exactly.

02:47.958 --> 02:52.416
And what did I say to her?
Do you think I told her to settle down?

02:53.958 --> 02:55.791
Answer me, pippity-squeaks!

02:55.875 --> 03:01.416
Do you think I told her to...

03:02.625 --> 03:03.625
settle down?

03:03.708 --> 03:06.458
- Probably not!
- Probably not!

03:06.541 --> 03:08.166
Probably not, indeed.

03:08.916 --> 03:10.833
I told her to stand up.

03:10.916 --> 03:15.041
I told her to actualize and incentivize.

03:15.125 --> 03:20.166
I told her to keep her eyes in the clouds
and her feet on the stars.

03:21.166 --> 03:27.750
Do you know what happened?

03:32.791 --> 03:36.666
She died in a mysterious fire.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.000
Wait, what?

03:41.083 --> 03:44.083
Settling down is what losers do.

03:44.166 --> 03:47.416
- But the woman you were talking about...
- Settling down started World War I.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.416
Okay, but the story you were telling...

03:49.500 --> 03:52.708
Settling down is what happens
when you bite your lip,

03:52.791 --> 03:55.541
and your lip gets swollen,
so you bite your lip again,

03:55.625 --> 03:59.208
and then you keep biting your lip
over and over.

03:59.291 --> 04:00.500
I don't want that.

04:01.125 --> 04:02.666
Do you want that, Prufrock Prep?

04:02.750 --> 04:05.333
- No!
- Let's bring in the violin!

04:08.333 --> 04:11.041
The whole school is falling
for the treachery of an unhinged villain.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.791
That always happens at pep rallies.

04:12.875 --> 04:16.791
This might be our only chance to stop him.
Sunny, stay here.

04:22.291 --> 04:24.208
Stop the music.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.708
- Everyone, listen, please!
- How dare you interrupt a genius!

04:26.791 --> 04:28.250
And his guest violinist.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.666
This man is not a genius.
This man is an impostor.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.750
The term is "improviser."

04:32.833 --> 04:35.666
This so-called gym teacher
is the notorious villain Count Olaf.

04:35.791 --> 04:38.375
As long as he's at Prufrock Preparatory,
nobody is safe.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.083
That's not true. You're jealous.

04:40.166 --> 04:43.500
Throw them off the stage, and I'll start
my dance over with extra twirls.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.708
Well said, adorable cheerleader.

04:45.791 --> 04:47.375
This man is Count Olaf. We can prove it.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.458
The Baudelaires seem like honest
and decent people.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.541
We should listen to what they have to say.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.125
Down in back.

04:54.208 --> 04:56.750
Count Olaf, who is wanted
by the authorities

04:56.833 --> 04:59.791
for suspicion of fraud, theft, murder
and child endangerment.

04:59.875 --> 05:03.041
- And arson.
- Who has one eyebrow instead of two.

05:03.125 --> 05:05.708
Why, there's nothing wrong
with being bushy.

05:05.791 --> 05:07.833
If I open my shirt now, you...

05:07.916 --> 05:12.291
- If Count Olaf took off his turban...
- Isn't she marvelous, everybody?

05:12.375 --> 05:16.708
I'm afraid my two glorious eyebrows
will remain hidden

05:16.791 --> 05:20.416
underneath this turban,
which I wear for religious reasons.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.625
And what religion might that be?

05:27.583 --> 05:29.166
Reconstructionist Judaism.

05:30.125 --> 05:33.458
Reconst... ism. Yes, that.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.333
I would never ask you
to remove your turban.

05:36.416 --> 05:40.750
I'm against religious persecution,
but I can't speak for the orphans.

05:40.833 --> 05:44.000
Olaf can also be identified
by the tattoo of an eye on his ankle.

05:44.083 --> 05:46.958
My body is a temple, young man.

05:47.041 --> 05:51.333
I would never sully my skin the way
so many young people do nowadays

05:51.416 --> 05:55.458
with their hedonistic lifestyle
of loud music and abstinence.

05:55.541 --> 05:57.458
Why don't you take off your shoes
and prove it?

05:57.541 --> 06:00.916
- Absolutely not.
- Is that for religious reasons, too?

06:01.000 --> 06:06.041
No, it's because taking
your shoes and socks off is gross.

06:06.125 --> 06:09.708
We can compare Genghis to the photograph
of Olaf in The Daily Punctilio.

06:09.791 --> 06:11.583
You sound like a boring librarian.

06:12.166 --> 06:13.875
Plus, we don't need newspapers

06:13.958 --> 06:16.458
now that we have
our advanced computer system.

06:21.166 --> 06:24.125
Oh. Uh, you mean that computer.

06:24.208 --> 06:26.041
He's sweating. He's nervous.

06:26.125 --> 06:28.791
No, I'm not.
I have naturally leaky pores.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.041
Will you and your pores please stand

06:31.125 --> 06:33.750
in front of this very expensive
electronic device

06:33.833 --> 06:36.208
and just clear this matter up,
once and for all?

06:36.291 --> 06:38.375
I, uh...

06:39.625 --> 06:42.458
Mmm, this reminds me of a story.

06:52.583 --> 06:55.416
This is not Count Olaf.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.375
- See?
- Yeah, see?

07:01.416 --> 07:06.083
I think this calls for a little democracy,
my second favorite style of government.

07:06.166 --> 07:11.875
How many of you want to hear
more tiresome accusations

07:11.958 --> 07:15.333
hurled at an innocent man from orphans?

07:15.416 --> 07:17.208
Investigate further!

07:17.291 --> 07:19.791
We demand that this issue
get further scrutiny!

07:23.375 --> 07:27.458
And who here wants to hear
about an exciting new program

07:27.541 --> 07:31.416
that is sure to blast your school spirit
right out your blowhole?

07:36.708 --> 07:39.125
Students! Faculty!

07:39.208 --> 07:42.916
Don't worry if every exercise program
you have tried has failed you,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.083
because I am here to fail you more

07:45.166 --> 07:48.291
by putting the "whip"
back into "whip you into shape."

07:48.375 --> 07:51.416
Everyone, get on your feet,
and let's try something

07:51.500 --> 07:55.625
that I invented one lonely night
at a truck stop, called jumping jacks.

07:55.708 --> 07:56.833
Here we go. Ready?

07:56.916 --> 08:01.666
One! Two! Okay. All right. All right.
Let's cool it down. Let's cool it down.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.375
We don't want to ham up
the old hamstrings. Whoa!

08:05.916 --> 08:08.458
Oh, God, can someone say, "Class dismissed

08:08.541 --> 08:11.416
- for ice water and some deep breaths"?
- Um...

08:11.500 --> 08:14.000
I know. I'll be okay.
I just need a second.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.625
- But the...
- What?

08:16.583 --> 08:17.666
What?

08:19.416 --> 08:20.416
Yeah. Oh.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.625
Yes! Yes!
One last thing, everybody.

08:24.708 --> 08:28.208
As anyone who has been
to junior college knows,

08:28.291 --> 08:31.208
orphans tend to have unsound bodies,

08:31.291 --> 08:35.791
which leads to paranoia, delusion
and untapped wealth.

08:35.875 --> 08:41.625
That's why I have developed
the Special Orphans Running Exercises,

08:41.707 --> 08:44.458
or S.O.R.E. for short,

08:44.541 --> 08:48.458
which I will be offering
to a few select students.

08:48.541 --> 08:51.500
Will the orphans in the house
please stand?

09:03.500 --> 09:05.833
Okay, okay.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.500
I choose...

09:08.583 --> 09:10.000
you.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.125
And...

09:12.250 --> 09:13.458
oh, you.

09:13.541 --> 09:17.333
And little baby secretary
I've heard so much about.

09:19.083 --> 09:23.541
The three of you will report
to the athletics field at sundown

09:23.625 --> 09:26.125
and every night until further notice.

09:26.208 --> 09:29.708
This does not excuse you
from missing my nightly violin recital.

09:29.791 --> 09:31.208
You're going to owe me candy.

09:31.291 --> 09:34.458
That's the sort of leadership
I was talking about.

09:34.541 --> 09:35.666
You are a genius.

09:35.750 --> 09:37.875
- You're a genius for noticing.
- You're the genius for saying so.

09:37.958 --> 09:40.333
- You're a genius for agreeing.
- All right, I'm the genius.

09:40.416 --> 09:44.666
Drat! Everybody is dismissed!
This pep rally is over.

09:47.125 --> 09:50.125
Whatever you're up to, Count Olaf,
we will put a stop to it.

09:50.208 --> 09:51.583
Really?

09:51.666 --> 09:54.833
Because it seems to me
if you had the skills to stop me,

09:54.916 --> 09:58.750
we wouldn't be having
this batch of episodes in your new lives.

10:00.416 --> 10:05.375
Oh, orphans, your parents
really taught you nothing at all.

10:05.458 --> 10:07.291
They taught us to survive.

10:07.375 --> 10:11.375
Well, I guess those who can't do, teach.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.541
See you at sundown.

10:19.666 --> 10:23.083
He found us again. Everywhere we go,
he shows up to steal our fortune.

10:23.166 --> 10:25.083
How can he get our fortune
as a gym teacher?

10:27.875 --> 10:30.458
There's treachery
lurking in most exercise programs.

10:30.541 --> 10:32.583
I can't believe he fooled everyone again.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.583
Not everyone.

10:34.666 --> 10:36.750
Don't worry, Baudelaires.
Don't feel disgrace.

10:36.833 --> 10:38.583
The Quagmire triplets are on the case.

10:38.666 --> 10:41.250
You're kind and generous,
but we can't let you get involved.

10:41.333 --> 10:42.833
Violet's right. Olaf is too dangerous.

10:42.916 --> 10:44.708
He's too dangerous for you to face alone.

10:44.791 --> 10:46.416
We can run away. All of us.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.750
Our parents own
the famous Quagmire Sapphires,

10:48.833 --> 10:50.750
so when we come of age,
we can live on our own.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.916
We're not of age yet.
Besides, we tried running away

10:53.000 --> 10:56.666
and ended up working in a lumber mill.
Count Olaf still found us there.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.333
That's a picture of our parents.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.750
- Our parents, too.
- They did know each other.

11:04.791 --> 11:09.208
We had this photo in our library.
We never paid attention to it.

11:09.291 --> 11:11.375
I bet there were other mysteries
we never noticed.

11:11.458 --> 11:13.583
- Like a spyglass.
- Or a book.

11:14.083 --> 11:16.166
We need to survive long enough to find it.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.458
The librarian said to check back
in a day or so.

11:18.541 --> 11:20.791
We don't have a day or so.
It's almost sundown.

11:24.958 --> 11:28.291
I'm here to deliver a special message
to the Baudelaires.

11:40.541 --> 11:41.708
That doesn't rhyme.

11:41.791 --> 11:45.291
Only cake-sniffers care about poetic form.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.208
"He laughed
at his own foolishness.

11:50.291 --> 11:51.291
Ha-ha-ha.

11:51.375 --> 11:55.166
As he laughed, he noted the numbness
in his bare fingers.

11:55.250 --> 11:59.375
Also, he noted the feeling which had come
to his toes when he sat down

11:59.458 --> 12:00.916
was already fading away.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.291
He wondered whether the toes
were warm or numb.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.000
He moved them inside the moccasins."

12:07.083 --> 12:09.208
Jack London,
if I'm not mistaken.

12:10.458 --> 12:11.291
What?

12:11.375 --> 12:14.375
The story you were just reciting
is by Jack London.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.250
Snicket?

12:22.833 --> 12:26.500
Jacques Snicket.
Did somebody call for a taxi?

12:31.250 --> 12:34.541
Punctuation, orphans.
Punctuation.

12:34.625 --> 12:37.916
- Punctuation?
- The art of arriving not late.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
That's punctuality.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.500
You said to be here at sundown.
We're not late.

12:41.583 --> 12:42.750
That's curious.

12:42.833 --> 12:46.041
Someone just referred to you
as the late Baudelaires.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.708
Maybe they were talking
about your parents.

12:49.541 --> 12:52.333
That reminds me of a story
that I'm gonna tell you.

12:52.416 --> 12:58.125
Some years ago, a set of wealthy children
came to me, needing my help.

12:58.208 --> 13:02.583
There were three of them, one of each.
Girl, boy and baby.

13:02.666 --> 13:05.625
"Coach Genghis," they said to me,
"we're failures.

13:05.708 --> 13:11.625
Our parents have abandoned us
for careers as burnt-up skeletons.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.958
We have nothing in our lives
but all these bags of money,

13:16.041 --> 13:19.583
and they're making us failures
who read books and stuff."

13:21.583 --> 13:26.791
And do you know what I told them?

13:26.875 --> 13:28.750
I know this one.
Did you tell them to stand up?

13:28.833 --> 13:30.041
They were already standing.

13:30.125 --> 13:31.791
To actualize and incentivize?

13:31.875 --> 13:33.333
That doesn't mean anything.

13:33.416 --> 13:38.333
I told them to put on
some very expensive running shoes

13:39.333 --> 13:43.625
and then to take
this bucket of luminous paint.

13:43.708 --> 13:46.958
"Luminous" is a word I invented
for things that glow in the dark.

13:47.041 --> 13:48.666
We know what "luminous" means.

13:48.750 --> 13:52.958
And then they are to drag this bucket
around and around

13:53.041 --> 13:57.125
until they have made
a luminous circle on the ground.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.083
That's it?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.291
Yes, that's my exercise program.

14:03.375 --> 14:07.291
Genius ideas are simple,
like the wheel or neurosurgery.

14:07.375 --> 14:13.500
The orphans will run around
and around and around in a circle

14:13.583 --> 14:17.458
to exercise their
mother-and father-less legs.

14:17.541 --> 14:21.625
Um, okay, but what are you going to tell
the Baudelaires to do?

14:21.708 --> 14:23.250
- What am I...
- Yeah.

14:23.333 --> 14:24.708
- It's the same.
- What's the same?

14:24.791 --> 14:26.833
Isn't it time
for your little light to shine?

14:26.916 --> 14:29.000
Oh, I need a few minutes to rosin my bow.

14:29.083 --> 14:30.666
Don't say that in front of the children.

14:31.791 --> 14:34.625
Whatever you're up to, Olaf, we will...

14:38.625 --> 14:40.750
I've got to get the book
to the Baudelaires.

14:40.833 --> 14:43.708
Try not to speak until
we get some hot chocolate in you.

14:43.791 --> 14:48.958
Well, well, if it isn't a cake-sniffer
and his cake-sniffing friend.

14:49.666 --> 14:51.375
You must be Carmelita Spats.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.125
How do you know?

14:53.208 --> 14:56.458
I work for an organization that keeps tabs
on young people of interest.

14:56.541 --> 14:59.041
Well, obviously. I'm interesting.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.291
Interesting can mean
a few different things.

15:01.375 --> 15:04.333
A polka-dot suit is interesting,
but no one looks good in one.

15:04.416 --> 15:06.125
This man here is my friend,

15:06.208 --> 15:09.625
and I don't appreciate
anyone mistreating my friends,

15:09.708 --> 15:11.416
no matter what age they are.

15:13.541 --> 15:18.291
Oh, and by the way,
I believe it takes one to know one.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.291
Cake-sniffer.

15:21.291 --> 15:24.583
- You stood up for me.
- Going back to school can be traumatic.

15:24.666 --> 15:26.291
That's why I keep
a trauma blanket in my cab.

15:26.375 --> 15:27.750
My hero.

15:35.583 --> 15:38.291
Quagmires! What can I do
for you two triplets?

15:38.375 --> 15:40.708
We know it's after hours,
but did you find that book?

15:40.791 --> 15:43.291
I'm sorry.
I know you're desperate to get it.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.416
It's not just the book.
There's a whole mystery.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.958
There certainly is.

15:47.041 --> 15:49.791
I couldn't find the book,
so I poked around.

15:49.875 --> 15:53.083
It's not in any system.
It's like it doesn't exist.

15:53.166 --> 15:56.250
Who dares not be in the auditorium
for my recital?

15:56.333 --> 15:58.583
The children had
a question about the library.

15:58.666 --> 16:02.791
The library is closed until further notice
by order of the gym teacher.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.750
He can't close the library.

16:04.833 --> 16:08.250
I should have looked over
his contract more closely. Or at all.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.458
He's also designated
the freezer as off-limits,

16:11.541 --> 16:12.833
so there go all my Popsicles.

16:12.916 --> 16:14.666
It's only temporary, though,

16:14.750 --> 16:18.083
until he gets his
Special Orphans Running Exercises

16:18.166 --> 16:21.500
and what he wants, something,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.000
Now get moving, twins.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.541
- We're not twins.
- Our brother Quigley...

16:24.625 --> 16:26.500
"Our brother Quigley died in a fire."
I know.

16:26.583 --> 16:29.166
Try to work up some pleasant small talk
for a change.

16:35.625 --> 16:39.416
Keep running, orphans. Run for your lives.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.000
- What are we doing?
- Uh, running in circles.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.916
How does that help Olaf
steal our fortune?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
- I don't know.
- Something else has to happen.

16:46.083 --> 16:49.458
There's no way he'll make us
run laps all night.

16:51.375 --> 16:55.500
I brought you a quintuple macchiato
so you can make them run all night.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.541
You want me to keep you company?

16:57.625 --> 17:01.625
- I know I get lonely sometimes.
- Why don't you check out the concert?

17:01.708 --> 17:03.583
Oh. Okay.

17:06.415 --> 17:09.665
That's what I'm saying. Olaf is here.
My disguise was discovered.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.665
The library is closed,
and there's a girl who keeps tap dancing.

17:12.750 --> 17:15.375
- Jacquelyn.
- You can't leave the Baudelaires alone.

17:15.458 --> 17:16.833
They've made friends.

17:16.915 --> 17:20.915
There's a stunningly skillful librarian
who's keeping an eye on them.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.333
You should see her shelve books.

17:22.415 --> 17:26.583
There's one book I'm worried about.
Did you give it to the Baudelaires?

17:26.665 --> 17:29.000
I'm sorry. I'll go right back now and...

17:29.083 --> 17:30.458
Jacquelyn.

17:30.541 --> 17:33.291
I need to get Larry into the city
to be treated for frostbite

17:33.375 --> 17:36.125
and overexposure
to off-brand dishwashing liquid.

17:36.208 --> 17:39.041
I'll leave the meter running
and be back at Prufrock soon.

17:39.125 --> 17:42.458
I'm leaving for the day,
and I'll be buying some candy.

17:42.541 --> 17:44.666
Hurry. These are dark days.

17:49.166 --> 17:52.541
That night was indeed a dark day.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.250
All nights are dark days,

17:54.333 --> 17:57.500
because night
is simply a badly-lit version of day.

17:57.583 --> 18:02.416
But a dark day also refers to a time
when something terrible is going on.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.416
It was a dark day for Count Olaf's troupe,

18:05.500 --> 18:09.375
who were not good enough actors
to pretend to be awake.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.541
It was a dark day in the history of music,

18:13.625 --> 18:16.583
as Vice Principal Nero,
who could not play violin,

18:16.666 --> 18:19.625
insisted for several hours
on doing so anyway.

18:22.875 --> 18:25.041
It was a dark day for the Quagmires,

18:25.125 --> 18:28.250
who hoped to help the Baudelaires
any way they could.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.500
And it was a dark day for the faculty,

18:31.583 --> 18:34.750
including Mr. Remora,
who was developing a sore on his lip,

18:34.833 --> 18:38.791
and Mrs. Bass, who would be arrested
shortly for bank robbery.

18:38.875 --> 18:42.000
Not to mention the school librarian,
whose own fate...

18:42.916 --> 18:44.708
would be even worse.

18:57.833 --> 19:01.666
But, of course, the night
was the darkest day for the Baudelaires,

19:01.750 --> 19:05.500
as they ran lap after lap
after lap after lap...

19:06.250 --> 19:08.208
night after night

19:08.291 --> 19:10.333
after night after night...

19:10.416 --> 19:13.291
...knowing nothing of Count Olaf's plan.

19:13.375 --> 19:15.916
Nothing of how they
could defeat his treachery.

19:16.791 --> 19:19.458
Nothing but their own
desperate exhaustion...

19:23.500 --> 19:25.541
...acute boredom,

19:25.625 --> 19:29.291
and the terrifying knowledge that
always approaching was another dark day,

19:29.375 --> 19:31.875
a phrase which here means

19:31.958 --> 19:33.708
"more time at school."

19:36.791 --> 19:37.833
Pop quiz.

19:37.916 --> 19:42.041
Everybody grab a piece of paper
and write down everything they remember

19:42.125 --> 19:44.666
about the time I spilled soup
on my sweater,

19:44.750 --> 19:49.291
including the vegetables in the soup,
the washing instructions for the sweater

19:49.375 --> 19:50.833
and the number of geese on the farm

19:50.916 --> 19:53.708
where my in-laws
opened their bed and breakfast.

19:53.791 --> 19:55.625
Pop quiz! Question number one.

19:55.708 --> 19:57.916
What is the circumference
of yesterday's pomegranate?

19:58.000 --> 19:58.875
Question two.

19:58.958 --> 20:01.833
What are the dimensions of the vault
at Mulctuary Money Management?

20:01.916 --> 20:05.375
Question three. How far apart
in decimeters are the security cameras?

20:05.958 --> 20:08.083
I need you to really pay attention
to these numbers

20:08.166 --> 20:11.333
and give me exactly what I'm asking for.

20:11.416 --> 20:15.083
Dear Mr. Mozart,
I have now written you six times

20:15.166 --> 20:19.166
and I can think of no possible reason
why you've not replied.

20:19.250 --> 20:20.666
Perhaps you're afraid

20:20.750 --> 20:22.833
of a little competition?

20:22.916 --> 20:25.541
If I'm not mistaken,
you've written 41 symphonies.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.625
I've written over 4,000.
I'm writing one right now.

20:28.708 --> 20:30.708
It's called,
"Why Won't You Write Me Back?"

20:32.500 --> 20:34.583
You must be on your last leg.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.166
I haven't been this exhausted

20:36.250 --> 20:38.791
since I stayed up all night
with my first Tesla coil.

20:38.875 --> 20:40.375
At least you weren't late to class.

20:40.458 --> 20:43.750
I've never flunked a test,
but I got every measurement wrong.

20:43.833 --> 20:45.166
Of course you flunked.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.333
Olaf has been making you run laps
every night.

20:47.416 --> 20:49.291
We're no closer
to figuring out his scheme.

20:49.375 --> 20:53.583
It's like that luminous circle
he made us paint is a giant glowing zero.

20:53.666 --> 20:54.916
We know zero about it.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.625
He's hoping
you'll be so sick of running,

20:56.708 --> 20:58.041
you'll hand over your fortune?

20:58.125 --> 21:01.666
He's had stranger plans.
If only the library weren't closed...

21:01.750 --> 21:05.083
Cake-sniffers talking about a library.

21:05.166 --> 21:07.166
Is there anything less adorable?

21:07.250 --> 21:09.583
Go away, Carmelita. We're not in the mood.

21:09.666 --> 21:13.708
But I'm here to deliver
a special message to the Baudelaires.

21:27.208 --> 21:28.250
It doesn't rhyme.

21:42.791 --> 21:45.208
None of this rhymes! Songs have to rhyme.

21:46.291 --> 21:49.333
- There's 12 more verses!
- We get the message.

22:03.416 --> 22:07.708
Coach Genghis tells me that even after
running laps for nine hours,

22:07.791 --> 22:09.541
you remain out of shape and winded.

22:09.625 --> 22:13.291
Your teachers say you've flunked
quizzes in personal anecdotes

22:13.375 --> 22:15.291
and measuring random objects.

22:15.375 --> 22:20.750
And finally, don't even get me started
on Sunny's employee evaluation.

22:20.833 --> 22:24.416
I couldn't be more disgusted
if I'd written it myself.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.833
- You did write it yourself.
- "You did write it yourself."

22:27.916 --> 22:31.291
Luckily, your new gym teacher
has a solution. Jim.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.375
Let me tell you a story.

22:35.958 --> 22:38.291
- Homeschooling.
- What?

22:38.375 --> 22:41.791
Homeschooling. It means staying at home,
sitting at your kitchen table,

22:41.875 --> 22:43.291
instead of clogging up a classroom.

22:43.375 --> 22:46.833
Vice Principal Nero, Mr. Poe specifically
placed us at Prufrock.

22:46.916 --> 22:49.500
Mr. Poe wants us to stay here
at least a trimester.

22:49.583 --> 22:52.958
Keep your grades up,
or I'll toss you three out on your ears.

22:53.041 --> 22:55.000
Your wealthy ears.

22:55.083 --> 22:58.166
Tomorrow morning,
your teachers will give you both

22:58.250 --> 23:01.000
more-or-less comprehensive exams
in front of the whole school.

23:01.083 --> 23:04.541
And for Sunny, a professional reappraisal

23:04.625 --> 23:09.083
featuring a special sequence
of demeaning menial tasks.

23:09.166 --> 23:10.541
If you fail,

23:10.625 --> 23:12.250
it's off to Coach Genghis'

23:12.333 --> 23:16.166
Ultra-Dynamic Life-Ending Workshop.

23:16.250 --> 23:18.708
- We'll pass those exams.
- Of course we will.

23:18.791 --> 23:21.208
If you'll excuse us,
we're going to study in our shack.

23:21.291 --> 23:24.541
You don't have much time.
You're due at the athletic field

23:24.625 --> 23:28.041
for Special Orphan Running Exercises
in a matter of hours.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.666
- We still have to run laps?
- Of course.

23:30.750 --> 23:34.375
And it doesn't mean you'll be excused
from the violin recital.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.125
Looks like more candy for me.

23:36.208 --> 23:39.333
We can't study for comprehensive exams
and run laps all night.

23:39.416 --> 23:40.958
We'd have to be two places at once.

23:41.041 --> 23:43.666
Consider this a learning experience,
orphans.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.125
It's important you figure out

23:45.208 --> 23:48.500
the balance between academics
and extracurricular activities.

23:48.583 --> 23:50.208
Listen to us! This man is...

23:50.291 --> 23:52.750
This is not Count Olaf.

23:52.833 --> 23:55.458
Oh, goodness, how careless of me.

23:56.291 --> 23:59.625
Now, what is it you were saying?

24:03.333 --> 24:06.083
Violet,
Olaf is waiting for us at sundown.

24:08.166 --> 24:09.458
We don't have much time.

24:11.916 --> 24:14.125
- I said we don't have...
- I've got it.

24:14.208 --> 24:15.333
We're listening.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.708
Coast is clear.

24:31.916 --> 24:33.041
Find some glasses.

24:40.833 --> 24:42.208
This'll work.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.958
- These'll come in handy.
- We need something for the body.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.083
- Flour.
- Perfect.

26:13.875 --> 26:15.541
I'm impressed you know how to pick a lock.

26:15.625 --> 26:17.333
You'd be surprised
how often it comes in handy.

26:17.416 --> 26:18.750
This knot's called the Devil's Tongue.

26:18.833 --> 26:21.416
It was invented by female Finnish pirates
in the 15th century.

26:22.625 --> 26:23.750
How do I look?

26:25.041 --> 26:26.875
Different. Which is good.

26:26.958 --> 26:31.375
Not that you didn't look good before.
I mean, you do, you did, do look...

26:31.916 --> 26:34.375
Sunny, how are those glasses coming?

26:35.166 --> 26:38.500
You guys can still back out now.
We can find another way to pass the test.

26:38.583 --> 26:40.833
My sister and I won't sit...

26:42.875 --> 26:46.541
- We'd better hurry.
- Us, too.

26:49.250 --> 26:52.000
I have this feeling
we're never going to see you again.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.875
You could go back to your broom closet
and forget about this.

26:55.916 --> 26:59.291
- Is that what your parents would do?
- Our parents aren't here.

26:59.375 --> 27:02.208
I bet they taught you the same thing
our parents taught us.

27:02.291 --> 27:04.750
- What?
- What friends are for.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.250
We have to be careful sneaking out.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.458
You guys go first,
and we'll wait till it's clear.

27:14.625 --> 27:17.416
Duncan... you'll need these.

27:20.625 --> 27:21.791
Perfect.

27:21.875 --> 27:24.625
And Isadora, take this. Keep it.

27:24.708 --> 27:27.291
If anything goes wrong,
you might need a spyglass.

27:28.041 --> 27:32.041
I don't think anything will go wrong.
We'll see you Baudelaires before long.

27:38.625 --> 27:41.666
- What was that?
- A couplet.

27:43.291 --> 27:46.791
Sitting with friends,
talking about something important

27:46.875 --> 27:51.125
is one of the most powerful
and necessary forces in the world.

27:51.208 --> 27:54.250
It is the way
so many noble organizations begin,

27:54.333 --> 27:56.875
with a conversation between associates

27:56.958 --> 28:00.291
or even brothers.

28:00.375 --> 28:04.458
People gathered together
to fight treachery,

28:04.541 --> 28:09.125
as the Baudelaires and Quagmires
gathered together at Prufrock,

28:09.208 --> 28:12.166
is the reason
that so much wickedness is defeated.

28:13.208 --> 28:14.708
My brother told me that.

28:17.541 --> 28:19.541
I'd give anything to sit and...

28:20.750 --> 28:22.041
talk with him again.

28:39.791 --> 28:42.291
- You're late!
- Sorry, boss.

28:42.375 --> 28:43.625
Not you. Them.

28:43.708 --> 28:46.166
That waiter is long gone.
We searched everywhere.

28:46.250 --> 28:47.125
Mysterious!

28:47.208 --> 28:49.083
Somebody broke him out
by smashing the door.

28:49.166 --> 28:50.833
- Dastardly!
- And then they left in a taxi.

28:50.916 --> 28:51.833
Expensive.

28:51.916 --> 28:55.125
Enough! Leave me alone
so I can finish my plan.

28:56.041 --> 28:57.250
Me, too?

28:57.333 --> 28:59.458
I can't believe I'm here.

28:59.541 --> 29:03.666
Staying up all night in the athletic field
waiting for things to go my way,

29:03.750 --> 29:05.333
just like when I was in school.

29:05.416 --> 29:09.833
My whole life is going
around and around in circles.

29:09.916 --> 29:13.166
Like those things a hamster plays on
before you put it in the oven.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.583
- Aw.
- Well, it ends here.

29:17.416 --> 29:22.083
All right, orphans,
start going around and around in circles.

29:34.458 --> 29:36.833
What did Mr. Remora have
for dessert last Tuesday?

29:36.916 --> 29:38.416
- A pudding.
- What kind of pudding?

29:38.500 --> 29:40.666
- I don't know. Butterscotch?
- Rice.

29:40.750 --> 29:43.166
Rice pudding, rice pudding.
I have to remember that.

29:43.250 --> 29:44.708
How's the staple remover going?

29:50.916 --> 29:54.625
I know we're doing this
for serious reasons, but it's exciting.

29:54.708 --> 29:58.500
It may not be particularly wise,
but it's a thrill to be in disguise.

30:00.083 --> 30:02.541
I was young. I was finding myself.

30:02.625 --> 30:07.125
Trying out new fashion, new music,
playing with matches, that sort of thing.

30:14.625 --> 30:17.458
- His collar! It dribbled on his collar.
- Correct.

30:21.708 --> 30:23.000
I had it tough at school.

30:23.083 --> 30:25.541
Did I tell you what my nickname was?

30:25.625 --> 30:27.083
Did you tell me your name?

30:27.166 --> 30:29.583
- Wait...
- What?

30:29.666 --> 30:31.125
- Wait.
- What?

30:31.208 --> 30:32.500
The baby's pooped out.

30:32.583 --> 30:35.625
She's stopped running.
She's standing there like a bag of flour.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.458
Run, baby, run!

30:40.000 --> 30:40.833
Uh-oh.

30:40.916 --> 30:43.166
Maybe she needs a good kick to get moving.

30:48.250 --> 30:51.083
Get moving, baby.

30:54.708 --> 30:56.916
- What do we do?
- Keep running.

30:58.416 --> 31:00.500
Can we make it
to the broom closet?

31:01.375 --> 31:02.750
There's a better place.

31:09.833 --> 31:11.833
Oh, baby, baby...

31:13.375 --> 31:14.875
Are you okay? Huh?

31:16.791 --> 31:17.791
Stay here.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.416
Blast you, crumbling infrastructure.

32:24.791 --> 32:26.083
Boss.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.875
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

32:32.166 --> 32:34.208
I looked for them,
but it was dark and creepy.

32:34.291 --> 32:38.666
All right. Stay and guard the library.
All smarty-pants kids end up there.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.875
- Did baldy get the car?
- Yeah, but you have a little, uh...

32:42.416 --> 32:43.708
- What?
- On your face.

32:43.791 --> 32:45.041
- I do?
- Yeah.

32:46.833 --> 32:47.833
Did I get it?

32:48.666 --> 32:50.250
There's still a bit on the other side.

32:50.833 --> 32:51.916
On the...

32:58.125 --> 32:59.125
I...

33:00.166 --> 33:01.166
Thumbs up.

33:02.333 --> 33:03.250
Oh.

33:03.916 --> 33:05.833
Right, 'cause you don't have...

33:09.583 --> 33:10.875
We have to warn them.

33:10.958 --> 33:13.000
We can't go anywhere
with him guarding the door.

33:13.583 --> 33:15.666
The Baudelaires can pass that test.

33:16.791 --> 33:17.791
Look.

33:38.416 --> 33:39.416
The spyglass.

33:56.750 --> 33:58.541
Let's do some studying of our own.

33:58.625 --> 34:01.375
What color were the cows
on the dairy farm?

34:03.708 --> 34:05.416
Brown and...

34:12.958 --> 34:14.750
That explains the fire.

34:23.041 --> 34:25.625
- We've seen that man.
- It's all connected.

34:25.708 --> 34:28.083
How long was the navy blue scarf?

34:30.250 --> 34:31.250
Klaus?

34:32.166 --> 34:35.125
- VFD?
- What do you think it could mean?

35:05.708 --> 35:08.041
What's so important about a sugar bowl?

35:24.625 --> 35:28.625
Baudelaires, are you ready
for the worst morning of your...

35:28.708 --> 35:31.333
- Good morning!
- Ahh! What are you doing here?

35:36.083 --> 35:38.958
I'm Arthur Poe
from Mulctuary Money Management.

35:39.041 --> 35:40.125
I know who you are.

35:40.208 --> 35:42.083
Really? You do?

35:42.916 --> 35:46.875
Uh, it's my job to know.
I'm a gym teacher.

35:46.958 --> 35:49.666
Obviously. You're a grown man
wearing athletic shoes.

35:49.750 --> 35:51.375
I'm looking for the Baudelaires.

35:51.458 --> 35:53.958
I understand they've missed
several violin recitals,

35:54.041 --> 35:58.375
and that Vice Principal Nero is thereby
entitled to several bags of candy.

35:58.458 --> 35:59.416
So am I.

35:59.500 --> 36:02.583
And who are you, little girl,
besides adorable?

36:02.666 --> 36:04.041
My name is Carmelita Spats,

36:04.125 --> 36:06.666
and I deserve candy
for bringing the Baudelaires to you.

36:06.750 --> 36:09.666
I suppose that more or less follows.
Here you go.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.208
Hmm. They're in that shack.

36:12.416 --> 36:14.166
- "Shack"?
- Nobody said "Orphan Shack."

36:14.250 --> 36:16.000
The auditorium is this way.

36:16.083 --> 36:20.166
Tell me, would you ever be interested
in a self-actualization workshop

36:20.250 --> 36:23.083
- held in the vault of your bank?
- I'd consider it.

36:47.666 --> 36:51.291
Maybe I'm just tired,
but I think she's improving.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.500
This is not Count Olaf.

36:54.583 --> 36:56.750
This is not Count Olaf.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.125
Who can't be beat?

36:58.208 --> 36:59.666
A dead horse!

36:59.750 --> 37:02.333
- Who can't be beat?
- A dead horse!

37:02.416 --> 37:03.541
Who can't be beat?

37:03.625 --> 37:04.833
A dead horse!

37:04.916 --> 37:06.458
Who can't be beat?

37:06.541 --> 37:08.833
This is not Count Olaf.

37:09.583 --> 37:11.791
- Who can't be beat?
- A dead horse!

37:11.875 --> 37:13.208
Baudelaires!

37:14.375 --> 37:15.916
Mr. Poe, what are you doing here?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.500
Well, I'm giving you
a very disappointed look.

37:18.583 --> 37:21.833
You've been spending too much time
with extracurricular activities.

37:21.916 --> 37:23.708
I don't think homeschooling is the answer,

37:23.791 --> 37:25.500
but I brought along
the necessary paperwork,

37:25.583 --> 37:27.125
as suggested by Vice Principal Nero

37:27.208 --> 37:30.833
and by a gym teacher
who I met wandering around outside.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.500
That gym teacher is Olaf in disguise.

37:32.583 --> 37:36.041
He tracked us down and is in the middle
of a scheme to steal our fortune.

37:36.125 --> 37:39.666
Olaf? But...  what about the
computer system Nero told me about?

37:39.750 --> 37:40.625
It hasn't worked.

37:40.708 --> 37:42.708
This is not Count Olaf.

37:42.791 --> 37:45.958
- It certainly appears to be working.
- There you are.

37:46.041 --> 37:48.041
- You must be Vice Principal Nero.
- Is that candy?

37:48.666 --> 37:51.791
The computer system didn't recognize Olaf,
because he's in disguise.

37:51.875 --> 37:55.500
What sane man would disguise himself
four times in a row?

37:55.583 --> 37:58.958
Believe me, Poe,
I've seen this sort of thing before.

37:59.041 --> 38:02.291
Children will say anything
to explain getting bad grades

38:02.375 --> 38:05.166
and failing at their work
as administrative assistants.

38:05.250 --> 38:07.833
- Assistants?
- Sunny's been working as a secretary.

38:09.333 --> 38:12.291
Sunny should be in preschool.
That doesn't seem suitable.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.916
If they flunk these exams,
the Baudelaires will be expelled,

38:17.000 --> 38:18.208
so it hardly matters now.

38:18.291 --> 38:20.291
This is not Count Olaf.

38:20.375 --> 38:22.916
Oh! Coach Genghis, come on in.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.625
Good morning! Today is the first day
of the life of your rest.

38:29.208 --> 38:33.000
First life of the rest of your day.

38:33.083 --> 38:34.750
- Mmm-mmm. No. No.
- Today...

38:37.333 --> 38:38.875
Why on the candy?

38:38.958 --> 38:43.000
Today is the first day
of the life of your rest.

38:43.083 --> 38:45.791
That's what I said.
I said it the right way the first time.

38:45.875 --> 38:48.916
This so-called Coach Genghis
is Olaf in disguise.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.291
Klaus, you can't argue with technology.

38:51.375 --> 38:54.458
Well said, Hat Stevens.

38:54.541 --> 38:57.375
You must be a very self-actualized person.

38:57.458 --> 39:00.250
- Well, I do eat a lot of yogurt.
- Delicious!

39:00.333 --> 39:03.500
Showtime. So let's go... time.

39:04.458 --> 39:06.291
Remember, you will die!

39:06.416 --> 39:10.166
Remember, you will die!
Remember, you will die!

39:10.250 --> 39:12.125
Remember, you will die!

39:12.208 --> 39:15.791
Remember, you will die!
Remember, you will die!

39:15.875 --> 39:17.750
Remember, you will die!

39:17.833 --> 39:21.708
Remember, you will die!
Remember, you will die!

39:21.791 --> 39:23.416
Remember, you will die!

39:23.500 --> 39:28.541
- Remember, you will die!
- Yes! Yes, let's hear it.

39:30.750 --> 39:36.000
I want your energy dumped on my head
so it can run down my face like lotion.

39:36.083 --> 39:39.333
Yes! Yes!

39:42.541 --> 39:43.916
Whoo!

39:44.000 --> 39:47.250
- I feel it. Can you feel it, Caligula?
- Nero.

39:47.333 --> 39:51.166
This school has
a new kind of spirit energy.

39:51.250 --> 39:55.958
A sense of unity and joy
which you usually cannot find

39:56.041 --> 39:58.958
unless you are at a birthday party
or a public hanging.

40:00.375 --> 40:03.041
I must admit,
I'm a little excited to see this.

40:03.125 --> 40:05.958
I think the flunking
of the Baudelaire children

40:06.041 --> 40:08.416
out of this school is
bringing out the best of all of us.

40:08.500 --> 40:11.375
And so, without further ado...

40:11.458 --> 40:14.625
A violin cadenza
in the style of the Human League!

40:14.708 --> 40:16.166
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.
- What? No?

40:16.250 --> 40:18.250
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

40:18.333 --> 40:21.041
Hey, Gomorrah! Sass!

40:21.125 --> 40:23.625
It's Mrs. Bass, and my name is Remora.

40:23.708 --> 40:27.041
We'll find out who's full
of remora soon enough.

40:27.125 --> 40:30.875
Test them! Test them! Test them!

40:30.958 --> 40:32.916
Test them! Test them!

40:33.000 --> 40:37.791
Test them! Test them! Test them!
Test them!

40:37.875 --> 40:40.000
Violet, in the story about my pet donkey,

40:40.083 --> 40:42.166
- how many miles did the donkey run?
- Six.

40:42.250 --> 40:43.750
"Six."

40:44.916 --> 40:46.416
Yes, that's correct.

40:46.500 --> 40:48.416
Rats!

40:48.500 --> 40:50.666
Klaus, how long was the book
with the yellow cover?

40:50.750 --> 40:54.708
- Nineteen centimeters.
- "Nineteen centimeters!"

40:54.791 --> 40:55.958
Correct!

40:57.041 --> 41:00.958
Sunny Baudelaire, I need you to organize

41:01.041 --> 41:03.958
these file cards of students
who owe me candy.

41:04.041 --> 41:06.500
But not by name! No!

41:07.333 --> 41:11.083
But by the color of candy I want.

41:27.208 --> 41:30.583
Oh, that's very impressive, I must admit.

41:30.666 --> 41:34.041
Klaus, how long was
chicken breast number seven?

41:34.125 --> 41:35.125
Uh, ten centimeters.

41:35.791 --> 41:38.916
I take pride in how well
the Baudelaires are doing.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.333
It reflects well
on Mulctuary Money Management

41:41.416 --> 41:45.416
that they can recite facts from anecdotes,
remember certain metric measurements,

41:45.500 --> 41:47.375
and perform
secretarial duties competently,

41:47.458 --> 41:49.750
relatively soon
after the loss of their parents.

41:49.833 --> 41:52.166
- Will you excuse me, please?
- Oh, yes.

41:52.250 --> 41:54.708
How long was
hot water bottle number 53?

41:54.791 --> 41:56.000
Uh, 45 centimeters.

41:58.625 --> 42:01.791
In a world governed by corruption
and arrogance,

42:01.875 --> 42:03.625
it can be difficult to stay true

42:03.708 --> 42:06.250
to one's philosophical
and literary principles.

42:09.125 --> 42:12.291
In a world governed by corruption
and arrogance,

42:12.375 --> 42:14.666
it can be difficult to stay true
to one's philosophical

42:14.750 --> 42:16.333
and literary principles.

42:16.416 --> 42:18.958
It's something
you don't need to hear twice,

42:19.041 --> 42:21.375
because you already know that it is so.

42:26.791 --> 42:29.500
It can sometimes be
overwhelming to witness

42:29.583 --> 42:33.333
the series of unfortunate events
that rumble through one's life

42:33.416 --> 42:36.625
like a mysterious automobile
with its engine running.

42:38.416 --> 42:42.166
Which is why some people need to
excuse themselves from time to time

42:42.250 --> 42:44.500
to a place where the world is quiet.

42:46.833 --> 42:50.750
Like a crystal ball ready for anyone
who has an important question.

42:51.791 --> 42:53.541
I urge you to do the same.

42:53.625 --> 42:56.833
Look away from this austere academy
before it is too late.

42:57.375 --> 43:00.083
This episode in the lives
of the Baudelaires is nearly over,

43:00.166 --> 43:03.250
but there is still time
for it to get much worse.

43:19.833 --> 43:22.750
We've come to the end
of the comprehensive exams

43:22.833 --> 43:25.041
and the professional reappraisal
for the Baudelaires.

43:25.125 --> 43:29.875
Violet is a fine student
and passes language arts with high marks.

43:29.958 --> 43:32.208
I've never encountered anyone

43:32.291 --> 43:35.083
more fluent in the metric system
than Klaus.

43:35.166 --> 43:38.125
He gets an A-plus,
two centimeters by one centimeter.

43:38.208 --> 43:42.708
I hate to admit it, but Sunny
is a fantastic administrative assistant.

43:44.541 --> 43:45.833
Look...

43:47.333 --> 43:50.708
She edited my résumé,
highlighting my musicianship...

43:51.375 --> 43:55.916
without drawing attention to the fact
I never graduated middle school.

43:57.583 --> 44:00.000
What my sister means is, did we all pass?

44:00.083 --> 44:03.875
No. You're not adorable enough to pass.
You flunked!

44:03.958 --> 44:05.208
You flunked!

44:05.291 --> 44:07.833
You flunked! You flunked! You flunked!

44:07.916 --> 44:11.000
No, no. No, no, no.

44:11.083 --> 44:13.750
I share your discomfort
with orphans, Carmelita.

44:14.375 --> 44:17.708
I have to admit
the Baudelaires pass with flying colors.

44:17.791 --> 44:22.916
Mr. Poe, I will allow them
to stay the remaining trimester,

44:23.000 --> 44:25.541
and you may leave
after giving me the candy.

44:25.625 --> 44:27.916
Thank you, Vice Principal Nero.
And Baudelaires,

44:28.000 --> 44:31.541
the, uh, disappointment I expressed
earlier has been lifted by the fact

44:31.625 --> 44:34.708
you clearly memorized facts and anecdotes
to the best of your abilities.

44:34.791 --> 44:38.750
Sunny, I may consult with you later
about the bank's latest quarterly report,

44:38.833 --> 44:41.791
which could use a more dynamic layout.

44:43.291 --> 44:45.500
Not yet you won't.

44:48.916 --> 44:52.583
This is a comprehensive exam, isn't it?

44:52.666 --> 44:55.541
I'm the gym teacher,
and I haven't given my test.

44:55.625 --> 44:59.333
According to
the Prufrock Preparatory Handbook,

44:59.416 --> 45:04.625
gym teacher evaluations are worth
a full 51% of their grade.

45:05.625 --> 45:08.625
That is actually correct.
But how did you know?

45:08.708 --> 45:11.250
A long time ago,

45:11.333 --> 45:15.250
a handsome young man
was expelled from this very school,

45:15.333 --> 45:18.875
on this very stage, for that very reason.

45:18.958 --> 45:23.125
So, one last challenge, Baudelaires.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.333
And this one will determine
your entire future.

45:27.416 --> 45:31.041
- We'd be happy to run laps.
- We're in extremely good shape.

45:31.125 --> 45:34.500
There's a better way
to test your physical princess.

45:34.583 --> 45:37.250
- You mean "prowess."
- I think I mean "arms."

45:38.500 --> 45:41.375
Arm wrestling. No holds barred.

45:41.458 --> 45:46.416
Against an opponent who is as heavy
and as slow as a bag of flour.

45:46.500 --> 45:48.416
Sunny Baudelaire.

45:50.375 --> 45:52.750
Nerds, arm wrestling furniture!

45:53.333 --> 45:55.458
- Five bucks on Genghis!
- This isn't fair!

45:55.541 --> 45:57.416
You're a full-grown adult.
Sunny's a baby.

45:57.500 --> 46:00.958
- That hardly seems sporting.
- Fine, I'll take on the bookworm.

46:01.041 --> 46:03.166
- That seems fair.
- You can take the both of us.

46:03.958 --> 46:05.291
Uh, I'll pass.

46:05.375 --> 46:07.833
What's wrong?
Afraid you're not strong enough?

46:07.916 --> 46:09.291
A real gym teacher could do it.

46:09.375 --> 46:14.541
Yes, Coach Genghis, surely you're stronger
than two simpering schoolchildren.

46:14.625 --> 46:16.000
Of course I am!

46:22.791 --> 46:24.291
This reminds me of a story.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.666
Some time ago, three orphans came to me
needing my help.

46:28.500 --> 46:32.083
"Coach," they said to me,
"we're complete failures.

46:32.666 --> 46:34.333
We have an enormous fortune,

46:34.416 --> 46:38.541
and we're keeping it all to ourselves
out of our own selfishness.

46:38.625 --> 46:40.875
How do we learn to share?

46:41.416 --> 46:46.083
How do we learn to give up
in the face of all-powerful,

46:46.166 --> 46:48.750
very good-looking physical strength?"

46:49.333 --> 46:55.625
And do you know what I told them?

46:56.791 --> 46:58.500
You can never give up.

46:58.583 --> 47:02.583
You can never give up if you find yourself
in terrible circumstances.

47:02.666 --> 47:04.833
You must keep struggling.

47:05.416 --> 47:07.916
You must struggle
until you find a safe place to live.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.458
You must struggle until you find
noble and reliable friends.

47:11.541 --> 47:13.000
- Struggle...
- And struggle...

47:14.750 --> 47:17.250
Until the world can see
who you really are.

47:34.708 --> 47:36.291
That kid came out of nowhere!

47:37.208 --> 47:39.958
Holy Beethoven,
I see what you mean, Baudelaires!

47:40.041 --> 47:42.125
- Finally!
- What you mean...

47:42.750 --> 47:45.458
is that I should keep on struggling,

47:45.541 --> 47:50.791
and then perhaps I'll be invited
to join a legitimate orchestra.

47:50.875 --> 47:52.916
No, that's not what we mean at all.

47:53.833 --> 47:56.208
- Your shoe, sir.
- Look at the tattoo on his ankle!

47:56.291 --> 47:58.000
Egad! I'd know that ankle anywhere!

47:58.083 --> 48:00.375
You flatter me, kind sir.

48:00.458 --> 48:02.958
Don't call me "kind sir," kind sir.

48:03.041 --> 48:05.083
You're Count Olaf. That tattoo proves it.

48:05.166 --> 48:08.375
It's too late to cover it up
with a probably overpriced running shoe.

48:08.458 --> 48:12.250
I am not covering up anything.
I need to wear these.

48:12.333 --> 48:13.333
Don't be ridiculous!

48:13.416 --> 48:15.791
Why would a notorious criminal
need running shoes?

48:15.875 --> 48:16.750
Boss.

48:18.750 --> 48:20.000
For running.

48:20.583 --> 48:22.416
Go after him! Mr. Poe!

48:24.250 --> 48:25.083
Sunny...

48:31.958 --> 48:32.958
Wow! They're fast!

48:33.041 --> 48:35.291
They have been running laps
for a couple weeks.

48:35.375 --> 48:36.541
Go, horsey, go!

49:24.333 --> 49:28.458
Klaus! We found the answers!

49:28.541 --> 49:30.041
- Isadora!
- Duncan!

49:30.125 --> 49:31.916
- What can we do?
- Keep running.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.916
VFD! You have to remember!

49:35.000 --> 49:37.583
VFD!

49:37.666 --> 49:38.833
- Isadora!
- Duncan!

49:38.916 --> 49:41.125
We found the book!

49:41.208 --> 49:43.250
VFD!

49:44.750 --> 49:46.166
- Violet! Klaus!
- Help!

49:46.250 --> 49:48.083
Could someone please shut those kids up?

49:48.166 --> 49:50.291
- Klaus, Baudelaires!
- Shh!

49:50.375 --> 49:53.791
- Please help us! We found the book!
- VFD!

50:01.708 --> 50:02.958
- Isadora.
- Duncan.

50:03.041 --> 50:04.416
If you have lost a friend,

50:04.500 --> 50:07.708
you know it makes
your world feel incomplete,

50:07.791 --> 50:12.000
like a puzzle with a piece missing,
or one half of a broken spyglass.

50:13.875 --> 50:17.500
I'm sorry to tell you
that this story does not end

50:17.583 --> 50:20.291
with the rescue
of two brave and noble triplets.

50:20.375 --> 50:22.750
This story ends the way all stories end.

50:22.833 --> 50:25.708
With the motto
of Prufrock Preparatory School.

50:25.791 --> 50:29.291
That motto is "memento mori,"
and it means...

50:29.375 --> 50:33.500
Remember, you will die.
