        (somber music)

00:13.714 --> 00:16.548
        (somber music)

00:34.635 --> 00:37.469
        (upbeat music)

00:43.344 --> 00:47.546
        ¶ Ash and burn ¶

00:47.548 --> 00:52.584
¶ Wouldn't you say that's
the only way we learn ¶

00:53.354 --> 00:57.589
    ¶ We don't need nobody ¶

00:57.591 --> 01:02.428
    ¶ We don't need nobody ¶

01:02.430 --> 01:07.299
    ¶ We don't need nobody ¶

01:07.301 --> 01:11.570
    ¶ We don't need nobody ¶

01:11.572 --> 01:16.141
¶ When the red light and the
brake lights hit your face ¶

01:16.143 --> 01:21.146
¶ And you take me on a joy
ride back to your place ¶

01:21.148 --> 01:26.085
¶ We don't need nobody, no ¶

01:26.087 --> 01:29.388
    ¶ We don't need nobody ¶

01:39.400 --> 01:42.634
    ¶ Take me home tonight ¶

01:54.215 --> 01:56.248
        ¶ Don't ¶

01:56.250 --> 01:58.550
            ¶ Deny ¶

01:58.552 --> 02:03.489
¶ It's not fair that I'm too
scared, I don't know why ¶

02:03.491 --> 02:08.259
    ¶ They can't tell
    us what to do ¶

02:08.262 --> 02:10.829
    ¶ They don't even
    know the truth ¶

02:10.830 --> 02:13.332
    (cell phone ringing)

02:13.334 --> 02:17.236
        ¶ I can't help ¶

02:17.238 --> 02:19.338
    ¶ Falling for you,
    it's chemical ¶

02:19.340 --> 02:22.441
¶ And I don't need to hear it ¶

02:22.443 --> 02:26.678
¶ When the red light and the
brake lights hit your face ¶

02:26.680 --> 02:31.750
¶ And you take me on a joy
ride back to your place ¶

02:32.620 --> 02:36.522
    ¶ I don't need nobody ¶

02:36.524 --> 02:39.725
    ¶ I don't need nobody ¶

02:42.596 --> 02:44.229
    - [Jessica] Every
    day when you wake up,

02:44.231 --> 02:46.231
    before you even put
    your feet on the ground,

02:46.233 --> 02:49.701
    you tell yourself it's
    gonna be a great day.

02:49.703 --> 02:53.172
    ¶ Take me home tonight ¶

02:55.743 --> 02:57.242
    - Gonna be a great day.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.748
    ¶ Take me away to
    a different place ¶

03:02.750 --> 03:04.583
        (phone ringing)

03:04.585 --> 03:09.655
    ¶ I can't keep
    myself off of you ¶

03:10.624 --> 03:14.459
    ¶ Drag me down, drop
    me off onto town ¶

03:14.461 --> 03:19.531
¶ And I will follow you ¶

03:23.604 --> 03:27.873
¶ When the red and the
brake lights hit your face ¶

03:27.875 --> 03:32.811
¶ And you take me on a joy
ride back to your place ¶

03:32.813 --> 03:37.749
    ¶ We don't need nobody ¶

03:37.751 --> 03:40.886
    ¶ We don't need nobody ¶

03:49.563 --> 03:51.663
- [Jessica] You can't greet
each day with negative energy

03:51.665 --> 03:54.533
and expect positive
results, so start positive

03:54.535 --> 03:55.834
    and stay positive.

03:55.836 --> 03:59.671
It's gonna be a great
day, say it, and mean it.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.440
- Today's gonna be a great day.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.478
        (vomiting)

04:06.480 --> 04:08.580
- [Jessica] It's been
clinically proven that exercise

04:08.582 --> 04:11.016
    increases energy and
    libido, improves health

04:11.018 --> 04:12.784
and enhances self-esteem.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.686
    Look good, feel good.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.954
    - Wow, so you asked
    me to take you to work

04:16.957 --> 04:18.624
and you're doing Jane Fonda.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.694
No no no, not this, we're
gonna be late, let's go.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.695
            (sighs)

04:23.697 --> 04:24.896
            Really?

04:24.898 --> 04:25.831
    - What time is it?

04:25.833 --> 04:26.765
            Oh crap.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.837
- What happened to pushups?

04:33.274 --> 04:35.807
    - [Jessica] No
    excuses, no exceptions.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.543
    Stop being a spectator
    and get into the game.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.812
    Want to attract
    high-calibur mates?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.981
    You'll need low body
    fat and high endurance,

04:42.983 --> 04:45.317
both in and out of the bedroom.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.918
    Winners look good.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.062
        - Oh, sod off.

04:57.965 --> 04:58.864
            Taxi!

05:01.835 --> 05:04.970
    - [Jessica] Chapter two,
    dressing for success.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.838
    If you want to attract
    successful people

05:06.840 --> 05:08.473
you need to dress the part.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.808
Dress like you're as successful

05:09.810 --> 05:11.543
as you one day hope to become.

05:11.545 --> 05:14.913
Sloppy slouches never end
up as super models, do they?

05:15.916 --> 05:17.382
    - To differ, Jessica,
    what about Jonah Hill

05:17.384 --> 05:18.717
    and Donald Trump?

05:18.719 --> 05:20.719
    - Wait a second, who
    are you calling Jessica?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.788
Don't tell me you're still
reading that girly crap.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.823
    - No, no, I'm just
    thinking out loud.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.527
    - Oh god, what is that?

05:28.529 --> 05:29.795
        Oh, ew, ew, god.

05:29.797 --> 05:30.896
- [Andy] It's Confidence.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.431
        - Confidence?

05:32.432 --> 05:33.965
You need a lot of confidence
to wear that cat piss.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.284
    Where'd you get it,
    at the dollar store?

05:36.285 --> 05:38.602
- I can't do it this morning,
I can't take the knocking--

05:38.605 --> 05:40.505
- You need to do a little
spring cleaning around here,

05:40.507 --> 05:42.774
    I mean seriously,
    what the hell is that?

05:42.776 --> 05:43.842
- No, what are you doing?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.077
    My grandma gives
    me one every year!

05:45.079 --> 05:46.712
    - You don't wanna hurt
    Grandma's feelings,

05:46.714 --> 05:48.880
but you should shove
that into a drawer, fast.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.232
        - Thank you.

05:50.233 --> 05:51.583
    Look, are you taking
    me, or am I Ubering?

05:51.585 --> 05:53.252
    Like what am I doing?

05:53.253 --> 05:54.920
- Excuse me, I got lost in
your little piggy collection.

05:54.922 --> 05:55.954
    Let's go, let's go!

05:57.791 --> 05:59.458
- Bangs this morning, oh.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.560
            - Sasha?

06:01.562 --> 06:02.494
        - [Sasha] Hmm?

06:02.496 --> 06:03.795
- Can I raid your closet again?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.497
            - Again?

06:05.499 --> 06:06.832
        - Please.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.667
- My Chanel is your Chanel.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.069
Especially if you don't
throw Elvis out the window.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.773
        - Did he poop on
        the futon again?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.442
    - In your suitcase,
    but you know what,

06:17.444 --> 06:18.677
it's only because he trusts you,

06:18.679 --> 06:20.379
    because he doesn't just
    poop anywhere, do you?

06:20.381 --> 06:21.480
        No you don't.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.381
        Oh my baby.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.787
    - Oh, I really need
    to get my own place.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.088
            - Why?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.824
Devin's hardly around, and
I like having you here.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.459
- So does Elvis, apparently.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.497
- Now that you are broken
up, I want you to focus

06:38.499 --> 06:42.434
on your goals, your
dreams, and achieve them.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.935
    - Right now all I
    want to do is achieve

06:43.937 --> 06:46.104
looking as good as you in
one your Chanel dresses.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.706
- Hmm, good luck with that.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.108
            (laughs)

06:50.110 --> 06:51.076
- [Jessica] Wanna marry up?

06:51.078 --> 06:52.744
    Don't dress down.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.547
Wanna climb the corporate
ladder all the way to the top?

06:55.549 --> 06:57.949
    Then dress like
    you're already there.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.756
    You are the master
    of your own fate,

07:04.758 --> 07:08.427
    so be punctual, be
    diligent, be efficient,

07:08.429 --> 07:11.029
    and you will accomplish
    all of your goals.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.864
- Hello Linda, how's the desk?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.032
    - [Linda] Hello Andy.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.934
        - You're late.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.035
            Again.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.909
    You know, it is
    the 21st century,

07:23.911 --> 07:25.677
    there's some
    exciting new products

07:25.679 --> 07:28.113
    called razors and
    ironing boards.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.048
You should give them a try.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.684
    - Good one, boss.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.954
I mean, I sacrificed
underwear today, you know?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.223
In an effort not to be late.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.926
I'm going commando. (laughs)

07:40.928 --> 07:42.727
    - You're disgusting.

07:42.729 --> 07:43.628
            TMI.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.164
    - You're right,
    it's clearly TMI.

07:48.469 --> 07:52.971
- The toilet in the executive
wash room is clogged.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.907
I'd like you to take care
of that after you clock in.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.009
            (laughs)

07:59.112 --> 08:00.979
        - Kev, buddy.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.249
        That's not in my
        job description.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.617
    Can't maintenance do it?

08:05.619 --> 08:06.551
        - Oh, they can.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.954
        But you will.

08:10.090 --> 08:14.860
Call it your penance for your
allergy to being punctual.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.795
    You see, one of
    the perks of having

08:16.797 --> 08:18.497
    a high level job like
    mine is it gives me

08:18.499 --> 08:20.265
the right to be capricious.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.933
        I'm sorry, Andy.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.568
That may be a big word for you.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.270
You know what that means?

08:27.941 --> 08:31.776
    - It's 8:02 in
    the morning, okay?

08:31.778 --> 08:34.011
    I'm not gonna let
    you ruin my day.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.249
You think that I'm gonna
capriciously clean that toilet?

08:37.251 --> 08:38.149
        - So sad.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.951
        Yes, I do.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.253
    And if you have a
    problem with that,

08:41.255 --> 08:44.155
why don't you take it up
with our boss Mr. Warren?

08:44.157 --> 08:49.027
We all know the reason why he
feels he has to tolerate you.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.864
    So go ahead, and take
    care of that dump, Andy.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.699
        Ooh, ooh.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.967
            Dumpty.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.670
That will be your new nickname.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.973
It's perfect 'cause it's
dumb and D, I squeeze it,

09:01.975 --> 09:03.208
I wasn't finished with you.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.776
    Welcome to the Ravel.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.078
    - [Jessica] Not
    everyone will like you.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.180
    Not everyone will
    want you to succeed.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.016
    Life doesn't always
    give you what you want,

09:11.018 --> 09:14.052
but it does equip you with
what you need to learn.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.121
            (sighs)

09:20.694 --> 09:21.593
            - Okay.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.039
        (water gurgling)

09:35.108 --> 09:37.242
            (coughs)

09:45.819 --> 09:47.953
            (typing)

09:53.760 --> 09:55.060
        (splashes)

09:55.062 --> 09:57.262
        (flushing)

09:57.264 --> 09:58.697
            What!

09:58.699 --> 10:00.065
    - [Jessica] Wanna
    take over the world?

10:00.067 --> 10:01.800
    You better own it first.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.034
    The world is yours.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.202
        Say it loud.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.137
    - The world is mine.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.042
    The world is mine.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.078
    The world is mine.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.145
        - Really, is it?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.314
    Could've fooled me.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.849
- [Jessica] You're on your way.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.017
    You're on the path.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.385
You're getting closer every day.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.287
    - Have to believe you
    can get what you want.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.254
    The world is mine.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.391
            (sighs)

10:26.392 --> 10:27.825
    You sure you don't want
    a copy of this book?

10:27.828 --> 10:28.393
        - Mm-hmm.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.630
    - I'm telling you, you
    wanna work here forever?

10:31.632 --> 10:33.916
This book will impact your life.

10:33.917 --> 10:36.201
- Right now I'm hoping that a
margarita will impact my life.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.268
        - I love you.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.070
    - I love you too.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.271
        - Night mama.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.206
        - Night baby.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.408
        (giggles)

10:44.778 --> 10:46.745
    - In a rat race like
    this, you have to be

10:46.747 --> 10:48.346
    the strongest and
    the fastest rat

10:48.348 --> 10:50.148
    if you wanna get the
    cheese that's waiting

10:50.150 --> 10:52.117
    on the other side
    of that finish line.

10:59.326 --> 11:03.028
And that is why we are all
here, to do the best we can,

11:03.030 --> 11:06.331
    to make the most of who
    we are, to win the race

11:06.333 --> 11:09.334
    and to win the game.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.402
        Thank you.

11:10.404 --> 11:13.104
        (applauding)

11:16.109 --> 11:17.108
            Hello.

11:17.110 --> 11:17.976
            - Hi.

11:17.978 --> 11:18.810
        - [Jessica] Hi.

11:18.812 --> 11:19.978
            - Wow.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.980
    You're so much
    prettier in person.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.381
    Well, that's a little
    bit absurd, actually.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.983
        (laughing)

11:24.985 --> 11:26.951
    - Thank you, you
    have great taste.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.020
    And I love your accent,
    what's your name?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.990
    - Hayley, H-A-Y-L-E-Y.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.892
        - Mm-hmm.

11:33.893 --> 11:35.793
- I'm actually thinking
about writing a book myself.

11:35.796 --> 11:36.461
        - Oh, awesome.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.196
        What about?

11:38.198 --> 11:41.132
    - Oh, I dunno, I dunno
    what my story is yet.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.801
    - Why don't you get
    out there and find out,

11:42.803 --> 11:44.069
    and when you have
    a book signing,

11:44.071 --> 11:46.171
I'll be front and center, deal?

11:46.173 --> 11:47.939
- Deal, yes, can I shake--

11:47.941 --> 11:48.873
            - Yes.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.041
    Nice to meet you.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.176
- Lovely to meet you, thank you.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.744
    - Good luck to you.
    - Thanks.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.218
            - Hi.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.219
            - Hi.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.355
    - Wow, you are
    prettier in person.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.357
    - Ah, you can tell with
    those shades on, huh?

12:06.359 --> 12:08.126
        - Oh, yeah.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.194
            Sorry.

12:09.196 --> 12:12.030
        (Jessica laughs)

12:13.200 --> 12:16.000
- Oh, you have beautiful
eyes, you should use them.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.803
And stitch up that shirt,
you're better than that.

12:18.805 --> 12:19.504
            - Oh.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.474
        Thank you.

12:22.476 --> 12:23.942
        Thank you.
        - Thank you.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.011
Want more and you'll get more.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.314
    Ask for more and
    you'll receive more.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.982
You wanna be rich, be rich.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.251
    You wanna be successful,
    be successful.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.187
    You are made of
    unrealized greatness.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.122
        Believe it.

12:38.291 --> 12:41.259
- Can I ask you to fix my shirt?

12:42.529 --> 12:44.162
        Stupid...

12:44.164 --> 12:46.231
            (gasps)

12:48.201 --> 12:49.501
(speaks foreign language)

12:49.503 --> 12:50.969
    - You're dreaming.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.138
    - I'm not, why,
    why am I dreaming?

12:53.140 --> 12:54.205
            - Okay.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.206
            Rich.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.074
            - Yeah.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.308
        - Handsome.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.309
            Funny.

12:59.212 --> 13:03.014
Under 35, with an IQ over 125?

13:03.016 --> 13:06.217
I mean, that's like an anomaly.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.219
That sounds like place in Italy.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.287
- Oh it does, yeah. (laughs)

13:09.289 --> 13:10.522
- I love the pizza in Anomaly.

13:10.524 --> 13:13.324
        (laughing)

13:13.326 --> 13:15.293
That's not found in nature.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.263
    Okay, that's like a
    nudist that you really

13:18.265 --> 13:19.264
    want to see naked.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.331
        - [Hayley] Wait.

13:22.068 --> 13:27.138
- Any man like that is
going to stray or he's gay.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.040
        That rhymes.

13:29.042 --> 13:29.874
        - Oh, it does.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.075
        Well done.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.311
    - Exhibit A, Joey.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.546
            - Hey!.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.915
What have we spoken about?

13:36.917 --> 13:39.050
    We do not say his
    name aloud, do we?

13:39.052 --> 13:40.919
    - Sorry, please
    don't get violent.

13:42.889 --> 13:47.025
    Exhibit A, he whose name
    we do not say out loud.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.459
    - [Hayley] Thank you.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.211
        - He was cute.
        - Yeah.

13:50.212 --> 13:51.962
- He had a nice butt.
- he did have a nice butt.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.331
He had a really nice butt.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.099
    - He was successful.
    - Yeah.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.334
    - What did he do?

13:57.904 --> 13:59.971
Sleep with a Hooters waitress.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.441
- Okay, first off, Hooters
has lovely chicken wings.

14:03.443 --> 14:07.278
Second of all, maybe he did
not mean to sleep with her.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.279
        - Sure, honey.

14:08.281 --> 14:11.149
    And listen, I
    don't like cocaine,

14:11.151 --> 14:12.517
I just like the way it smells.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.987
- Look, I don't wanna settle.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.390
    - Everyone settles.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.059
    To varying degrees.

14:21.061 --> 14:25.597
    People, actual living,
    breathing, human people,

14:25.599 --> 14:28.099
    will never live
    up to the fantasy.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.301
            Never.

14:30.303 --> 14:35.139
    Like Taylor Swift,
    never, ever, never.

14:36.042 --> 14:36.941
            Okay.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.544
    Thank you for doing
    my nails, though.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.346
    They look pretty.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.081
    I wanna look really
    good for when I drop off

14:43.083 --> 14:45.250
Mia's financials, although
she's doing my head in.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.185
    She's driving me crazy.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.386
- You need to slap that bitch.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.320
            - I do.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.989
    I do need to smack her.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.223
        Like a huge one.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.224
    - All five fingers.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.459
            - Mm.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.460
            - Thumb.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.428
        (laughing)

14:57.430 --> 15:00.131
        (light music)

15:05.405 --> 15:06.504
            - Oh!

15:06.506 --> 15:08.606
- Watch where you're going.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.441
        - You serious?

15:10.443 --> 15:11.943
            Wow.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.345
    - Welcome to the
    Ravel of New York.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.280
            - Hi.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.915
I'm looking for my colleague?

15:18.051 --> 15:19.784
            - Okay.

15:19.785 --> 15:21.518
Well, we have a bulletin over
there with today's posts,

15:21.521 --> 15:23.154
do you have a meeting room?

15:23.156 --> 15:24.956
    - I don't know where.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.192
    - Do you know your
    colleague's name?

15:28.194 --> 15:30.194
    - Cruella Deville.

15:30.196 --> 15:31.362
    - Are you British?

15:31.364 --> 15:32.430
    - You're a smart one.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.367
- Let me guess, Kate or Diana.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.002
    - [Hayley] Pardon?

15:38.004 --> 15:38.603
        Oh, my name?

15:38.605 --> 15:39.437
        - [Andy] Yeah.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.705
        - No, why.

15:40.707 --> 15:45.476
    - You look like royalty,
    or a beautiful princess.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.946
        (laughing)

15:47.948 --> 15:49.514
        - I'm Hayley.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.282
    - So Princess Hayley.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.451
        I'm Andy.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.519
    - Oh, I've gotta go.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.721
    - Wait, you're leaving?

15:56.723 --> 15:58.556
    I don't think I can face
    the world without you.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.191
    - Oh, I think you
    underestimate yourself.

16:00.193 --> 16:03.428
    - No, really, I'd
    love to see you again.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.997
    - Well find me and
    you never know.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.510
        - You're late.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.079
        What happened?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.647
- I know, I'm so sorry, the
bloody traffic was awful,

16:22.649 --> 16:24.415
    I nearly broke my
    heel, I tore my brief,

16:24.417 --> 16:25.450
    it's just a bad morning.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.484
        - Are you okay?

16:28.421 --> 16:30.755
- Thank you for asking that.

16:32.058 --> 16:35.293
    If I'm honest, I'm
    really missing my ex.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.494
I stupidly went onto Instagram

16:36.496 --> 16:38.162
    and I saw him with
    his new girlfriend,

16:38.164 --> 16:39.097
and that was just really--

16:39.099 --> 16:40.298
- Yeah, I don't actually care.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.499
            - Oh.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.468
    - I have no time now
    to go over these.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.136
    - Oh, I'm so sorry--

16:45.138 --> 16:47.305
- Make sure this never
happens again, you got it?

16:47.307 --> 16:49.374
    - I'm sorry, I did ask
    them though to get--

16:49.376 --> 16:51.509
    - No, don't ask, you
    demand what you need

16:51.511 --> 16:53.544
    and you make them
    give it to you.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.047
    And by the way, you
    represent my spa,

16:56.049 --> 16:57.749
    and I looked better
    during my first labor

16:57.751 --> 16:59.450
    than you look right now.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.618
    Go fix your face.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.521
    - You should be nicer
    as a mother now.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.526
            (groans)

17:15.602 --> 17:19.537
    - Sleeves rolled
    up, still unshaven,

17:19.539 --> 17:22.173
    and what were you doing
    flirting with a guest?

17:22.175 --> 17:24.776
- I wasn't flirting with a,
and she wasn't even a guest,

17:24.778 --> 17:26.411
    she was looking for--

17:26.413 --> 17:28.613
- Everyone who walks through
that door is a guest.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.616
    Listen here, Dumpty.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.186
Did you enjoy cleaning
the toilets the other day?

17:37.157 --> 17:38.089
            (sighs)

17:38.091 --> 17:39.657
'Cause I've got a lot more jobs

17:39.659 --> 17:41.559
just like that waiting for you.

17:42.662 --> 17:43.828
        Do you got it?

17:45.698 --> 17:46.597
        - Got it.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.633
            - Good.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.575
    - Not gonna ruin my day.

18:00.647 --> 18:04.482
    (singing indistinctly)

18:04.484 --> 18:05.716
        Mr. Warren.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.086
- Pretty laying with
Kevin's computer again, hmm?

18:10.123 --> 18:11.389
            (laughs)

18:11.391 --> 18:13.324
    - It's a beautiful
    day out, isn't it?

18:14.561 --> 18:17.128
- You know your father hired
me when I was 20 years old,

18:17.130 --> 18:19.197
    right when I got here
    from Denmark, right?

18:19.199 --> 18:20.431
            - Yeah.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.568
    I've heard the
    story a few times.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.737
You had no shoes, you used
to put your used gum in a wad

18:26.739 --> 18:28.706
    and then take it out
    when you wanna chew it.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.542
I mean, such as, such as.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.479
    - Your father was
    like a brother to me.

18:35.381 --> 18:36.848
    If it wasn't for him I
    wouldn't have been able

18:36.850 --> 18:39.717
to move up from the mail
room to be the eventual CEO

18:39.719 --> 18:41.519
of the Imperial Hotel Group.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.455
    When he passed,
    he made me promise

18:44.457 --> 18:46.691
    to look after the hotels
    and look after you.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.560
    Only you and I know
    of this promise.

18:50.730 --> 18:54.432
- And I think you've done
pretty well on both of 'em.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.134
            - Wrong.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.835
I've done tremendously
well at running this hotel.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.872
We've turned a profit every
year I've been at the helm.

19:00.874 --> 19:04.142
    Went from having 21
    hotels in 12 countries

19:04.144 --> 19:07.445
    to having 49 hotels
    in 37 countries.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.713
        - It's amazing.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.883
And Mr. Warren, I have an idea--

19:11.885 --> 19:13.384
- But I've failed at you.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.888
I see a lot of potential in you,

19:16.890 --> 19:18.723
but you get in your own way.

19:19.893 --> 19:24.195
    You lack discipline, you
    lack focus, motivation.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.530
    The list goes on.

19:26.633 --> 19:27.698
    - Look, that's not
    entirely true--

19:27.700 --> 19:29.700
    - These are facts,
    not open for debate.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.804
        - I'm bored.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.776
I need more to do, I
need more responsibility,

19:38.778 --> 19:40.878
    and I'm very capable
    of having it.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.181
    - I agree, so I'm gonna
    try to motivate you.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.218
- What exactly does that mean?

19:47.220 --> 19:48.719
    - I'm going away for
    four weeks to Sri Lanka

19:48.721 --> 19:50.555
with my wife on a yoga retreat.

19:51.658 --> 19:55.726
She thinks I work too
hard, and so she's worried.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.328
    Ever since I had that
    heartburn last year

19:57.330 --> 19:58.629
she thought was a heart attack,

19:58.631 --> 19:59.697
she hasn't been able to move on,

19:59.699 --> 20:02.733
    so we will go to a
    spiritual retreat,

20:02.735 --> 20:05.770
    vegan, possibly
    nudist, and I just hope

20:05.772 --> 20:07.772
    I still have the tree
    hugging days in me.

20:07.774 --> 20:08.839
        - I'm there.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.541
    I would love to
    go with you guys.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.244
- I want you to be in charge
of this office while I'm gone.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.713
    You're a free spirit,
    I'm a free spirit,

20:15.715 --> 20:17.315
and I think you can handle it.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.385
Plus I don't really trust Kevin.

20:22.722 --> 20:26.657
    - Wait, so you're asking
    me to run this hotel.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.562
        (phone beeps)

20:31.564 --> 20:34.232
    - Would you send
    Kevin in, please?

20:34.234 --> 20:35.866
        - Sir, I...

20:35.868 --> 20:36.767
        - Don't speak.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.572
        - Yes sir.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.275
- While I'm gone, Mr. Palazzo
will be my personal bridge

20:44.277 --> 20:45.876
between Sri Lanka and New York.

20:48.982 --> 20:52.016
    - Mr. Warren, Dumpty
    is not qualified--

20:52.018 --> 20:53.684
- That's Mr. Palazzo to you.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.656
    - Mr. Warren, Mr.
    Palazzo is not qualified

20:58.658 --> 21:00.791
    to run a mile around
    the high school track.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.727
    He's not qualified
    to run a taco stand,

21:02.729 --> 21:05.763
    to run a fever, to
    run amok, no offense.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.732
- I am not interested in
your perspective in this,

21:07.734 --> 21:09.367
        Mr. Hartwell.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.636
For the next month, Mr. Palazzo

21:11.638 --> 21:13.738
    will no longer be
    working for you.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.540
You two will work together.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.842
        - Mr. Warren.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.877
    - [Mr. Warren] Is
    that understood?

21:19.878 --> 21:21.911
    - Mr. Warren, I cannot
    stress what a bad idea--

21:21.914 --> 21:23.714
    - Is that understood?

21:26.819 --> 21:27.752
        - Yes sir.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.463
- You will have access
to the corporate account,

21:39.465 --> 21:41.299
    which you will only use
    for corporate affairs,

21:41.301 --> 21:42.300
    is that understood?

21:43.469 --> 21:44.869
    You will have access
    to the company car,

21:44.871 --> 21:46.771
    which you will only use
    for company matters,

21:46.773 --> 21:48.072
    is that understood?

21:48.074 --> 21:49.540
            - Yes.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.908
    - You will work
    out of my office,

21:52.779 --> 21:56.714
but you will not be making
any decisions, major or minor.

21:56.716 --> 21:57.948
    Is that understood?

21:58.751 --> 21:59.884
            - Yes.

21:59.886 --> 22:00.951
    - This is your
    opportunity to show

22:00.953 --> 22:02.953
    I should take you
    seriously, Andy.

22:03.956 --> 22:05.356
    Is that understood?

22:05.358 --> 22:06.691
            - Yes.

22:06.693 --> 22:10.861
    - Mr. Hartwell, Mr.
    Palazzo, make it work.

22:12.799 --> 22:15.933
    Namaste to you both.

22:15.935 --> 22:16.867
        - Namaste.

22:21.574 --> 22:22.707
        - Mr. Warren.

22:23.643 --> 22:24.942
    Look, before you go.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.413
I just wanna say thank you.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.818
    And I know if my
    dad were here too,

22:35.688 --> 22:36.721
he'd say thank you as well.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.356
    - You're welcome, Andy.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.425
- I'm not gonna let you down.

22:42.395 --> 22:43.761
    - I am counting on that.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.633
        (light music)

22:55.775 --> 22:57.508
    - I'm so sorry, I--

22:57.510 --> 22:59.410
    - Don't be, it happens.

22:59.412 --> 23:02.079
I'm sorry I have to do
this, it's just our policy.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.855
You know, actually, we're
having a recession special.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.424
    One free drink for every
    declined credit card.

23:16.529 --> 23:17.395
        - Thank you.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.966
It's actually my reversary.

23:21.968 --> 23:25.169
- I thought I've heard it
all, but what's a reversary?

23:25.171 --> 23:29.073
- It should've been my
anniversary, but it's not,

23:29.075 --> 23:31.976
    because my ex decided
    to go to Hooters,

23:31.978 --> 23:34.945
get a plate of hot wings and
a slutty waitress on the side.

23:34.947 --> 23:35.946
    - I'm sorry, hon.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.885
- I'm just gonna down this,
please don't judge me.

23:40.887 --> 23:41.919
    It's a British thing.

23:41.921 --> 23:42.853
            - Okay.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.857
        (gulping)

23:49.095 --> 23:50.428
Here, just have one more.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.762
    - That would be great,
    that would be great.

23:51.764 --> 23:55.800
    Sasha, I'm contemplating
    bankruptcy.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.670
    Seriously, all my
    cards are maxed out.

24:00.973 --> 24:05.709
- Oh, well, let's see what Miss
Jessica Banadetto has to say

24:07.113 --> 24:08.979
    about filing chapter
    11, shall we?

24:10.082 --> 24:11.649
            - Okay.

24:11.651 --> 24:12.483
            - Okay.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.018
        Let's see here.

24:14.020 --> 24:17.688
Never date down, blah blah
blah, in any capacity,

24:17.690 --> 24:19.924
    if you do, he or she
    will bring you down.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.559
Down to their financial class,

24:21.561 --> 24:23.594
    down to their stage of
    emotional development,

24:23.596 --> 24:25.463
    down to their lack
    of confidence.

24:25.465 --> 24:28.666
    Wow, Jesus, what is her
    next book gonna say,

24:28.668 --> 24:30.734
    men are like coffee
    and chocolate

24:30.736 --> 24:32.503
and they taste better rich?

24:33.840 --> 24:35.973
I mean, what's the plan
here, you're gonna like find

24:35.975 --> 24:39.643
some sugar daddy who has an
abundance of self-confidence

24:39.645 --> 24:42.112
    and amazing emotional
    development?

24:42.114 --> 24:44.114
        - Yeah, why not?

24:44.951 --> 24:46.650
- [Sasha] Oh, 'cause I
don't know, what about like,

24:46.652 --> 24:49.553
chemistry and passion and love?

24:49.555 --> 24:50.721
        - Ugh, stop it.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.957
    - [Sasha] Oh,
    sorry, Miss Shallow.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.592
    Yeah, I forgot, what
    was the plan again?

24:54.594 --> 24:57.995
Climbing social status,
seven figure bank account,

24:57.997 --> 25:00.698
    house in the Hamptons
    and then, wait,

25:00.700 --> 25:02.566
    what's the other
    thing I'm forgetting?

25:02.568 --> 25:04.001
        - Private jet.

25:04.003 --> 25:07.771
- Oh, yes, the very, very
important private jet.

25:07.773 --> 25:08.939
            (sighs)

25:08.941 --> 25:10.908
    - I've always wanted
    a private jet.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.142
    Is that too much to ask?

25:13.079 --> 25:15.145
    - Why don't you start
    with something smaller,

25:15.147 --> 25:18.549
    like stop spending
    and start thinking,

25:18.551 --> 25:21.986
    stop washing hair and
    put that MBA to use.

25:21.988 --> 25:25.089
Do a project that you
love, like write that book

25:25.091 --> 25:26.891
you're always talking about.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.158
    And you wanna find
    your own place,

25:28.160 --> 25:30.027
    and you want your
    career to take off,

25:30.029 --> 25:35.099
    and despite what Rich
    Boy, Rich Girl says,

25:36.035 --> 25:38.068
    you, my dear, want
    to fall in love.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.069
            (laughs)

25:39.071 --> 25:41.338
            - Yeah.

25:41.339 --> 25:43.606
- I cannot believe nobody ever
taught you how to tie a tie.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.609
- I feel like Cinderfella.

25:46.245 --> 25:47.278
        Just--
        - Relax, okay?

25:47.280 --> 25:49.013
I'm not trying to bone you.

25:49.815 --> 25:50.948
            (laughs)

25:50.950 --> 25:52.216
            Whoa.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.984
    What the heck is that?

25:53.986 --> 25:56.053
- That is--
- is that what I think it is?

25:56.055 --> 25:58.556
Do you know how many times
I've applied for one of those?

25:58.558 --> 26:00.024
    Even I don't make
    enough money for that.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.026
- You're like a millionaire.

26:02.028 --> 26:04.028
    - Yeah, but apparently
    not millionaire enough.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.296
    What the hell are
    you doing with it?

26:05.298 --> 26:08.098
    - Company card, use it
    for company expenses.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.068
- That's very admirable of you.

26:11.070 --> 26:11.902
    Don't Andy it up.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.754
    What the hell is this?

26:13.755 --> 26:15.605
I thought I was the only one
man enough to get a mani-pedi.

26:15.608 --> 26:17.875
    - Why are you always
    just grabbing stuff?

26:17.877 --> 26:20.027
    - It's just what I do.

26:20.028 --> 26:22.178
- It's something that my future
wife dropped at the hotel.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.647
    - Your future wife?

26:23.649 --> 26:24.582
            Really?

26:24.584 --> 26:26.050
Have you even taken her out?

26:26.052 --> 26:27.184
        - Not yet.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.752
    - Uh-huh, so you're
    stalking her.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.088
    - No, I'm wooing her.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.856
    - By stalking her.

26:32.858 --> 26:37.094
- No, by politely courting her.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.064
    - How does one politely
    court another exactly?

26:42.902 --> 26:44.234
        - Flowers.

26:44.236 --> 26:46.103
        (laughing)

26:46.105 --> 26:47.271
        - Flowers.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.772
    This isn't the
    '80s, kid, come on.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.174
These days we need a
little more than flowers.

26:50.176 --> 26:53.744
Like a limousine or a
nice dinner, maybe a show.

26:54.647 --> 26:55.846
        - Really?

26:55.848 --> 26:56.747
        - Really.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.083
        - I can't.

27:01.020 --> 27:04.788
        - You can.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.123
        - I shouldn't.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.191
        - But you will.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.132
        (bell ringing)

27:15.134 --> 27:19.970
        (gasps)
        (broom clatters)

27:19.972 --> 27:21.705
    - No no no no no no.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.275
        - Hayley.
        - Shh, shh.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.410
        Not here.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.845
    - You're right
    there, I can see you.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.246
- [Hayley] No no, no I'm not.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.815
    Shh, he's looking for
    me, he's looking for me.

27:31.817 --> 27:32.816
            - Hi.
            - Hi.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.320
- Maybe you could help me
out, I'm looking for Hayley.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.221
        Is she here?

27:39.258 --> 27:40.924
            (typing)

27:40.926 --> 27:41.859
        - Excuse me.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.394
    - Oh, no, do your thing.

27:44.697 --> 27:47.064
- Hayley's in her office.
- Okay.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.099
            (typing)

27:49.101 --> 27:51.201
- You can take a seat,
she'll be with you shortly.

27:51.203 --> 27:52.670
        - Oh, okay.

27:52.672 --> 27:53.370
        Thank you.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.140
        - She loves you.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.207
            - What!

27:58.711 --> 27:59.410
        - Excuse me?

28:00.379 --> 28:01.945
    - Sorry, nothing.

28:01.947 --> 28:04.248
    You can just, you
    can go have a seat.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.884
        This is stupid.

28:07.987 --> 28:11.221
- I'm sorry, what was that?

28:11.223 --> 28:14.024
    - Nothing, I'm talking
    on the phone, sorry.

28:14.927 --> 28:15.993
            - Oh.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.929
        (phone beeping)

28:18.931 --> 28:20.130
- What the heck are you doing?

28:20.132 --> 28:22.232
    - I can't let him know
    that I sweep hair.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.333
    Is he sitting now?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.936
    - No, he's breakdancing.

28:25.938 --> 28:26.870
        - [Hayley] What?

28:26.872 --> 28:28.138
- Yes, he is sitting down.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.092
- That was a mean thing to do.

28:31.093 --> 28:33.177
    I have a favor to ask
    you, just a teeny tiny,

28:33.179 --> 28:35.345
    could you, what size
    dress do you wear?

28:35.347 --> 28:36.346
    - Absolutely not.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.748
- Take this off, take it off.

28:37.750 --> 28:38.315
        - No, I don't...

28:44.356 --> 28:48.058
- Okay, so I can't do two,
can we move it to three?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.259
        - Mm-hmm.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.861
    Also, Mr. Johnson
    wants to invest

28:50.863 --> 28:53.063
    in one of your new
    business ventures.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.465
    - Oh, fine, but if
    he wants a meeting,

28:54.467 --> 28:56.433
you must tell him that
it's a minimum investment

28:56.435 --> 28:57.835
of 100K to get me out to lunch.

28:57.837 --> 28:58.769
I'm just not doing it anymore.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.237
    Do we have any messages?

29:01.107 --> 29:02.906
    - No, your highness.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.308
- Delia, what are you wearing?

29:04.310 --> 29:07.211
    We have a dress code
    here, please observe it.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.079
- There's something a gentleman.

29:09.982 --> 29:10.914
        - [Hayley] Hi.

29:10.916 --> 29:11.815
            - Hi.

29:13.385 --> 29:14.752
        - You found me.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.887
- Oh, I'm very resourceful.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.323
        - Delia, can you
        grab me a latte?

29:19.325 --> 29:21.125
        - [Delia] Yeah.

29:21.127 --> 29:22.059
    - Please, thank you.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.929
Remind me of your name again?

29:25.931 --> 29:26.830
            - Andy.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.099
    And these are for you.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.334
    - Oh, what are these?

29:30.336 --> 29:31.435
        - Flowers.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.402
        (laughing)

29:32.404 --> 29:33.337
        - Flowers?
        - Yeah.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.005
- [Hayley] I've heard of those.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.341
- So, I hope you don't mind me

29:37.343 --> 29:39.076
    coming to see you
    at work like this.

29:39.078 --> 29:39.977
            - No.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.013
    - What exactly do
    you do around here?

29:44.250 --> 29:45.916
    - Just some consulting
    here and there

29:45.918 --> 29:47.484
at the other midtown affiliates,

29:47.486 --> 29:49.219
you know, amongst other things.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.522
            You?

29:51.523 --> 29:53.824
- Oh, (scoffs) I have a
job that's got way too many

29:53.826 --> 29:56.860
titles and hyphens to fit
on a business card, so.

29:56.862 --> 29:58.095
            - Ah.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.229
    - Are you impressed?

29:59.231 --> 30:00.230
        (laughing)

30:00.232 --> 30:01.165
    - [Hayley] Maybe.

30:01.167 --> 30:03.901
    - [Jessica] When asking
    someone out to dinner.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.169
- So you feeling spontaneous?

30:05.171 --> 30:07.104
- [Jessica] Confidence is key.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.340
            - Maybe.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.575
- [Jessica] Dictate the
situation and don't hesitate.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.277
    - I want you to meet me.

30:13.279 --> 30:18.348
    6:00 for a gorgeous
    sunset and you know,

30:19.318 --> 30:22.252
    never-ending laughter
    and maybe some dinner.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.887
- [Jessica] You are in control.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.640
    You are in demand.

30:26.641 --> 30:28.424
- I'm not sure if I can do
that, let me just check my,

30:28.427 --> 30:30.160
    (bell rings)
    mm, yeah, I can, good.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.545
    - Did you even check?

30:31.546 --> 30:32.929
    - Yeah, yeah, weird
    that you didn't see it.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.665
        No, we're fine.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.399
    So good, see you
    later, see you later.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.902
You are late, someone
needs their hair washing.

30:38.904 --> 30:40.337
            Bye!

30:40.339 --> 30:41.572
- What the hell is going on?

30:41.574 --> 30:44.041
- I think the coffee is ready.

30:44.043 --> 30:47.444
    - Okay, go ahead.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.951
    - So, what does he do?

30:53.953 --> 30:56.854
    - I think he's some
    sort of hotel executive.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.889
    - Oh, well that sounds
    too good to be true.

30:58.891 --> 31:01.225
    - Oh, so are his eyes.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.927
    When you see them,
    oh, just want to--

31:03.929 --> 31:05.896
        - Easy, tigress.

31:05.898 --> 31:06.897
            - Sorry.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.398
        (chuckles)

31:08.400 --> 31:12.970
There may also be like one
tiny, tiny other problem.

31:14.006 --> 31:15.873
    He might have a slightly
    skewed perception

31:15.875 --> 31:18.108
    of what I actually
    do for a living.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.643
- You have got to own it.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.411
        Own your status.

31:21.413 --> 31:24.248
- No, I know, but Jessica
says to get success

31:24.250 --> 31:26.149
you have to exude success.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.886
            (groans)

31:28.888 --> 31:30.487
You hate the book, don't you?

31:30.489 --> 31:31.922
            (sighs)

31:31.924 --> 31:33.357
    - We're not gonna talk
    about that, are we?

31:33.359 --> 31:35.425
No we're not, we're not
gonna talk about that at all,

31:35.427 --> 31:39.463
because we don't care if
Jessica says that (babbling).

31:39.465 --> 31:40.397
- That's looking pretty good.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.999
            - Yeah.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.600
- Maybe just a little bit
mess on the top right there.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.502
- Can you--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, like that.

31:45.504 --> 31:46.303
        That's perfect.

31:46.305 --> 31:47.604
    Okay, so where were we?

31:47.606 --> 31:49.473
    She's beautiful,
    she's successful.

31:49.475 --> 31:50.474
            (groans)

31:50.476 --> 31:52.442
    - She's incredible.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.478
And her accent, so adorable.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.513
    She says tomorrow
    instead of tomorrow,

31:56.515 --> 31:58.382
    and she's cute and
    she's got beautiful--

31:58.384 --> 32:00.417
- Yeah, I think we covered
the beautiful thing.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.152
    Listen, this is
    starting to sound

32:02.154 --> 32:05.122
a little too good to be true,
so cool your jets there, okay?

32:05.124 --> 32:06.356
        (spraying)
        (coughs)

32:06.358 --> 32:08.292
    There's a little
    Confidence for ya.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.360
        (light music)

32:10.362 --> 32:13.430
- Use good wine terminology
to handle conversations.

32:13.432 --> 32:17.467
Oaky, creamy, and buttery
shows that you know your wines.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.469
        - It's hard.
        (Hayley giggles)

32:19.471 --> 32:20.604
            Love it.

32:20.606 --> 32:21.571
        It's round.

32:23.008 --> 32:24.441
    Velvety textured.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.478
- [Waiter] Courtesy of the chef.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.680
        Enjoy.
        - Ah, thank you.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.516
    Wow, look at that.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.484
            - Ooh!

32:34.486 --> 32:36.386
I don't think you eat those.

32:36.388 --> 32:37.454
    - Yeah, they're edible.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.156
- No, I don't think they are.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.093
    - Wow, look at that bar.

32:43.095 --> 32:45.162
            (spits)

32:46.265 --> 32:49.533
    - You know, I'm really
    happy that you found me

32:49.535 --> 32:51.001
    as fast as you did.

32:51.003 --> 32:51.735
            - Yeah.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.471
    I can be tenacious.

32:54.473 --> 32:55.605
            - Hmm.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.307
I do have one thing, though.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.209
    It's kind of a
    little rule of mine.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.611
    I don't like to mix work
    with my personal life.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.714
I like to keep work as
work and my personal life

33:03.716 --> 33:05.182
    as my personal life.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.750
    - Yeah, I know,
    I'm the same way.

33:06.752 --> 33:08.118
    - [Hayley] Oh really?

33:08.120 --> 33:11.488
    - Yeah, I mean, running
    a hotel is tough.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.056
    - [Hayley] Yeah, I bet.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.025
    - So let's do that,
    let's make a deal.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.628
    No shop talk while
    we're together.

33:19.732 --> 33:21.331
- That is quite a
commitment after knowing me

33:21.333 --> 33:23.066
for hardly any time at all.

33:23.068 --> 33:24.234
        - Yeah, well.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.402
    Like I said, I can be--

33:25.404 --> 33:26.570
        - Tenacious.

33:26.572 --> 33:27.571
        Yeah, I got it.

33:27.573 --> 33:30.507
        (Andy chuckles)

33:40.486 --> 33:42.552
    - Have I told you
    how pretty you look?

33:42.554 --> 33:44.654
    I mean, If I say
    your body's amazing,

33:44.656 --> 33:46.523
would you hold it against me?

33:46.525 --> 33:49.059
        (laughing)

33:49.061 --> 33:51.628
    That's good--
    - That was smooth.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.130
- Snuck it right in there.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.531
    - Did you research that?

33:54.533 --> 33:55.766
    Did you google it?

33:55.768 --> 33:57.234
            - I did.

33:57.236 --> 34:00.404
    Yeah, I went cube,
    functional, pickup--

34:00.406 --> 34:01.505
- That's what you typed in?

34:01.507 --> 34:03.123
            - Yeah.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.740
    - Can I tell you what
    I'm thinking about?

34:09.748 --> 34:11.514
A little bit closer than that.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.583
    The maitre d' is
    really freaking me out.

34:17.089 --> 34:18.355
        - Shoo shoo.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.123
        (laughing)

34:20.125 --> 34:24.360
¶ It's not hard to fall ¶

34:24.362 --> 34:28.764
¶ It's too easy to break ¶

34:28.766 --> 34:32.101
¶ So I'll keep on pretending ¶

34:32.103 --> 34:36.440
    ¶ That you're not
    perfect for me ¶

34:36.442 --> 34:41.143
    ¶ As long as it takes ¶

34:41.146 --> 34:46.216
¶ It's not all my fault ¶

34:46.851 --> 34:51.353
¶ I know you feel the same ¶

34:51.356 --> 34:54.291
    ¶ But we can't be
    the just friends ¶

34:54.293 --> 34:58.628
¶ We've just been trying to be ¶

34:58.630 --> 35:00.564
    ¶ I know it's too late ¶

35:00.566 --> 35:01.798
        - Thanks.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.600
    ¶ But I'm just
    trying not to fall ¶

35:03.602 --> 35:06.636
    ¶ In love with you ¶

35:08.674 --> 35:10.640
I would invite you up, but...

35:12.277 --> 35:13.176
            - But?

35:14.279 --> 35:16.246
    - I gave up being
    a slut for Lent.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.647
        (laughing)

35:17.649 --> 35:19.282
        - Ah, so.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.818
    You're not a slut
    and you honor Lent?

35:22.754 --> 35:23.687
            - Yeah.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.323
    - I think you're a
    waste of my time.

35:26.325 --> 35:27.591
    Have a good night.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.726
        (laughing)

35:31.263 --> 35:33.430
    - No, you know I
    would, I just have

35:33.432 --> 35:34.764
an early meeting tomorrow.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.234
        - It's fine.

35:37.236 --> 35:38.435
    No, me too, I gotta
    go straight back

35:38.437 --> 35:39.769
    to the office to
    handle a few things.

35:41.707 --> 35:44.174
    - So, until next time?

35:44.176 --> 35:44.875
            - Yes.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.611
    Till the next time.

35:48.714 --> 35:52.382
¶ Back in each other's arms ¶

35:52.384 --> 35:53.683
        - Good night.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.485
    - Good night, Princess.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.721
    ¶ I hold you, you
    hold me, we hold on ¶

35:57.723 --> 35:59.523
¶ And let go of the walls ¶

35:59.525 --> 36:00.490
- Good night, flower eater.

36:00.492 --> 36:04.628
¶ We built around our hearts ¶

36:04.630 --> 36:09.699
    ¶ Broken fences mend ¶

36:10.602 --> 36:15.539
    ¶ Second chances start ¶

36:15.908 --> 36:17.807
        ¶ A new life ¶

36:18.744 --> 36:20.744
        - [Andy] Huh?

36:20.746 --> 36:23.480
- You see, that's what I'm
talking about, that looks sharp.

36:23.482 --> 36:24.932
        - [Andy] Yeah.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.383
I don't know how I'm
gonna explain the charges

36:26.385 --> 36:27.450
as a hotel expense, but--

36:27.452 --> 36:28.535
    - Are you kidding me?

36:28.536 --> 36:29.619
These are clothes for meetings.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.588
    And as Mr. Warren's
    personal liaison,

36:31.590 --> 36:33.957
    it is important for
    you to look good.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.425
    - [Andy] You're right.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.728
    - I mean, you like
    this girl, don't ya?

36:39.598 --> 36:40.430
            - Yeah.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.365
    She's incredible.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.234
Oh, and I have an amazing
idea for the second date,

36:44.236 --> 36:44.868
        by the way.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.303
        - Excellent.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.470
        (exhales)

36:47.472 --> 36:49.206
    - I'm like a
    high-class criminal.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.407
        (laughing)

36:50.409 --> 36:51.675
    Not exactly the look
    I was going for,

36:51.677 --> 36:54.344
but hell, I will take it.

36:54.346 --> 36:58.315
Oh, I set up the meeting
at the bank to air my idea.

36:58.317 --> 36:59.249
    - Get out of here.

36:59.251 --> 37:00.817
Come on, come on, give me a hug.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.553
    - All right, all right.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.922
        (light music)

37:07.726 --> 37:09.242
- [Andy] You're outta your mind.

37:09.243 --> 37:10.759
    - No, Keith Rune is
    better than John Bonham.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.862
- John Bonham was incredible,
are you kidding me?

37:12.864 --> 37:16.333
    When you see him live,
    you just feel it.

37:18.704 --> 37:19.769
    - This is so beautiful.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.273
    Thank you for
    bringing me out here.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.510
- I have a surprise for you.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.579
    - I've already had a
    surprise, the yacht.

37:29.581 --> 37:30.714
    - Close your eyes.

37:30.716 --> 37:31.548
        (Hayley giggles)

37:31.550 --> 37:32.382
        Close them.

37:32.384 --> 37:33.283
            - Okay.

37:40.492 --> 37:41.491
        Can I open them?

37:42.928 --> 37:46.529
    (acoustic guitar music)

37:50.569 --> 37:52.969
¶ Simple but it's complicated ¶

37:52.971 --> 37:55.338
¶ Conversation underrated ¶

37:55.340 --> 37:59.909
    ¶ I could be your open
    book when you close ¶

37:59.911 --> 38:02.612
¶ Tell me is it too impulsive ¶

38:02.614 --> 38:04.748
    ¶ Asking you to
    stay till morning ¶

38:04.750 --> 38:09.686
    ¶ It's a familiar
    feeling we all know ¶

38:09.688 --> 38:12.555
¶ Now let's roll on out ¶

38:12.557 --> 38:14.758
    ¶ And stay up talking
    shit all night ¶

38:14.760 --> 38:16.960
    ¶ And climb the roof ¶

38:16.962 --> 38:19.863
    ¶ And watch the world
    be set on fire ¶

38:19.865 --> 38:21.765
    ¶ Break the rules ¶

38:21.767 --> 38:25.969
    ¶ And look for things
    we shouldn't find ¶

38:25.971 --> 38:29.005
        ¶ Inside ¶

38:29.007 --> 38:32.909
    ¶ 'Cause lately ¶

38:32.911 --> 38:37.747
    ¶ I been going crazy ¶

38:37.749 --> 38:42.619
    ¶ I think this
    might've saved me ¶

38:42.621 --> 38:47.324
¶ Exactly what I needed ¶
(laughing)

38:47.326 --> 38:52.395
¶ I need it tonight, night ¶

38:52.898 --> 38:56.866
    ¶ Tonight, night ¶

38:56.868 --> 39:01.571
¶ I need tonight, night ¶

39:01.573 --> 39:06.443
¶ Exactly what I needed ¶

39:06.445 --> 39:09.512
    ¶ I need it tonight ¶

39:11.683 --> 39:14.651
I didn't know you could do that.

39:14.653 --> 39:15.485
        (gulls cawing)

39:15.487 --> 39:16.486
    That was amazing.

39:16.488 --> 39:17.387
            - Aww.

39:18.690 --> 39:19.889
    I wrote it for you.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.024
    - Did you really?

39:21.026 --> 39:23.593
        (laughing)

39:23.595 --> 39:24.494
        Thank you.

39:25.931 --> 39:28.698
        (light music)

40:06.705 --> 40:07.637
            (sighs)

40:07.639 --> 40:09.606
    - I'm not using him.

40:09.608 --> 40:10.874
            - No.

40:10.876 --> 40:14.978
    Not for the nine course
    meals, the limo, yacht.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.380
            (laughs)

40:16.381 --> 40:17.781
    - All right, well when
    you put it like that,

40:17.783 --> 40:21.985
you have a fair point, but
Sash, I really like him.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.488
    - You do, don't you?

40:26.558 --> 40:28.491
        (laughing)

40:28.493 --> 40:30.827
    - That's why I can't
    tell him the truth, yet.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.780
I can't tell him the truth yet.

40:33.781 --> 40:36.732
- Well, it's not real until
you do, you know that, right?

40:38.904 --> 40:43.940
- Oh my god, what happened
to the Hayley I know, huh?

40:45.544 --> 40:47.010
The one who's a force of nature,

40:47.012 --> 40:48.812
    who's tough and
    strong and confident.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.914
    Student body president
    and never earned

40:50.916 --> 40:53.049
less than a B in her life, huh?

40:53.051 --> 40:54.784
        Where'd she go?

40:54.786 --> 40:59.589
'Cause the Hayley I know would
never lie about who she is.

40:59.591 --> 41:04.227
About her status or how hard
she works for her dreams.

41:04.229 --> 41:07.630
Baby girl, you have got
too much going on inside.

41:07.632 --> 41:08.998
    You're better than this.

41:11.102 --> 41:13.002
- I just don't know anymore.

41:13.004 --> 41:16.039
- Oh my god, so you got a
little banged up and bruised,

41:16.041 --> 41:17.607
        we all do.

41:17.609 --> 41:18.908
        (panting)

41:20.712 --> 41:21.444
            - Yeah.

41:21.445 --> 41:22.177
I haven't gotten laid in months.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.882
    - Well there is that.

41:27.586 --> 41:28.952
    - I'm gonna keep going.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.019
        - Yeah, I'm not.

41:30.021 --> 41:30.954
            - Okay.

41:30.956 --> 41:31.988
        - Okay.
        - Fair enough.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.523
- Yeah, good luck with that.

41:33.525 --> 41:34.491
    - [Hayley] Thanks.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.594
        (groaning)

41:39.197 --> 41:40.163
        (phone ringing)

41:40.165 --> 41:42.131
- So, that's basically it.

41:42.133 --> 41:44.501
    All I need is the
    startup capital.

41:44.503 --> 41:47.704
    - To cover what exactly?

41:47.706 --> 41:50.807
    - Well, I need an
    architect, for one.

41:50.809 --> 41:55.845
- But you don't have the
money to build the hotel.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.281
        - Well no.
        (laughs)

41:58.283 --> 42:00.984
    I mean I need to
    build the model first.

42:00.986 --> 42:04.087
    - And you would
    use the model to?

42:04.089 --> 42:07.123
- Show the investors what
the hotel might look like,

42:07.125 --> 42:09.259
    you know, so they'll
    invest in the build.

42:10.228 --> 42:11.594
    - A bigger model?

42:12.631 --> 42:14.664
    - Exactly, you know?

42:14.666 --> 42:17.600
    And I need money
    for market analysis,

42:17.602 --> 42:20.136
and to put the prospectus
together, and I mean--

42:20.138 --> 42:23.973
    - Couldn't you sorta
    do all this yourself?

42:23.975 --> 42:28.311
- No, well, I mean, maybe
if I had a computer.

42:30.549 --> 42:31.581
        - A computer.

42:32.651 --> 42:34.050
- You know, and then in theory,

42:34.052 --> 42:35.752
I can do some of those things.

42:35.754 --> 42:38.955
    Actually, heck, I could
    do all of those things.

42:38.957 --> 42:40.723
        This is true.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.158
        - Honestly.

42:42.160 --> 42:45.995
Who doesn't have a computer?

42:45.997 --> 42:49.732
    Your main problem,
    Mr. Palazzo, is--

42:49.734 --> 42:52.902
- Oh, oh, you can call me Andy.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.837
    I mean, we're past
    that point, right?

42:54.839 --> 42:56.205
    I can call you Tom.

42:56.207 --> 42:57.106
            - No.

42:58.677 --> 43:03.646
Your main problem, Andy, is
that you don't have assets.

43:05.617 --> 43:10.019
Liability and collateral,
and it would be impossible

43:10.021 --> 43:11.621
for us to give you a loan.

43:11.623 --> 43:14.791
    Find someone to bankroll
    your startup capital

43:14.793 --> 43:15.758
    and get you going.

43:17.862 --> 43:18.962
    Thanks for coming in.

43:20.298 --> 43:24.634
- When you say impossible, mm?

43:24.636 --> 43:25.835
        - Impossible.

43:27.072 --> 43:28.137
    Thanks for coming in.

43:29.140 --> 43:30.707
- [Andy] Great, thank you.

43:31.643 --> 43:32.976
    I'm gonna go ahead
    and take a pen.

43:34.079 --> 43:35.812
- Look, the answer is no, okay?

43:35.814 --> 43:37.080
        - Why not?

43:37.082 --> 43:39.082
    - Because I don't invest
    in friends' businesses.

43:39.084 --> 43:42.085
    I mean, eventually the
    friendship will suffer.

43:42.087 --> 43:43.252
    The business will fail.

43:44.089 --> 43:45.755
- My business is not gonna fail.

43:46.658 --> 43:48.691
- Why don't you ask Mr. Warner?

43:48.693 --> 43:51.961
    - It's Mr. Warren, and
    no, he's already done

43:51.963 --> 43:53.663
way too much for me already.

43:53.665 --> 43:55.064
- You got nothing to lose.

43:56.267 --> 43:58.101
Besides, he might like it,
I mean it's a good idea.

43:58.103 --> 43:59.969
Just all about the presentation.

44:01.673 --> 44:03.139
I tell you what I will do.

44:03.141 --> 44:05.141
    I've got the
    complete Adobe suite.

44:05.143 --> 44:07.110
    Photoshop, Illustrator,
    everything you need

44:07.112 --> 44:08.411
to make a kickass presentation.

44:08.413 --> 44:10.113
    I'll help you with that,
    you can use my computer.

44:10.115 --> 44:12.682
- Computer, I want you
to invest in the company,

44:12.684 --> 44:13.416
    I want your money.

44:13.418 --> 44:14.817
- It's not gonna happen, okay?

44:14.819 --> 44:17.120
    You can have my
    computer or nothing.

44:17.122 --> 44:18.688
    Oh, how's Holly doing?

44:19.324 --> 44:21.124
        - It's Hayley.

44:21.126 --> 44:22.225
        She's good.

44:22.227 --> 44:23.893
- You guys done the Macarena?

44:23.895 --> 44:25.128
        - [Andy] No.

44:25.130 --> 44:26.329
        - Really?

44:26.331 --> 44:27.864
    That must be some
    kinda record for you.

44:27.866 --> 44:29.232
            (laughs)

44:29.234 --> 44:32.201
- No, it's just, it's
different with this one, man.

44:32.203 --> 44:36.172
    And it's a mutual thing,
    just there's no rush.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.141
    - You must really
    like this girl.

44:38.143 --> 44:39.442
            - Yeah.

44:39.444 --> 44:41.210
    Really, it's killing me.

44:41.212 --> 44:43.746
    I'm dying. (laughs)

44:43.748 --> 44:45.682
    - Hey, you got
    plans for Saturday?

44:45.684 --> 44:47.367
            - No.

44:47.368 --> 44:49.051
- I got a couple tickets for
the opera, you can have them.

44:49.054 --> 44:50.019
    - [Andy] The opera?

44:50.021 --> 44:51.604
    - Yeah, the opera.

44:51.605 --> 44:53.188
Trust me, one night at the
Met and you'll get laid.

44:53.191 --> 44:54.290
        - The opera.

44:55.260 --> 44:56.159
            - What?

44:56.161 --> 44:57.160
    All right, forget it.

44:57.162 --> 44:58.561
    - No, I'll take it.

44:58.562 --> 44:59.961
    - I'm gonna give 'em to
    someone else, forget it.

44:59.964 --> 45:01.431
        - I trust you, I
        just, the opera?

45:01.433 --> 45:02.999
That's what's gonna turn her on?

45:03.001 --> 45:04.333
- That will close the deal.

45:04.335 --> 45:06.969
    - Yes, I'm heading to
    the caterer right now.

45:06.971 --> 45:08.738
I'm taking the corporate limo!

45:10.108 --> 45:12.241
    But nothing, I will
    talk to you later.

45:13.378 --> 45:16.145
        (light music)

45:17.215 --> 45:18.281
            Dumpty.

45:20.418 --> 45:21.317
            Dumpty!

45:24.422 --> 45:27.090
            Janine!

45:27.092 --> 45:27.990
            Janine!

45:29.794 --> 45:32.328
        (light music)

45:38.436 --> 45:40.870
    - [Jessica] The opera
    is a cultural benchmark.

45:40.872 --> 45:43.473
    A sophisticated
    and elegant affair,

45:43.475 --> 45:46.142
and although it can be
emotionally overwhelming,

45:46.144 --> 45:48.277
    unlike a wide receiver
    in the end zone,

45:48.279 --> 45:51.214
try and pretend like
you've been there before.

45:51.216 --> 45:54.117
    (classical music)

46:00.492 --> 46:03.459
    (camera clicking)

46:03.461 --> 46:07.363
(singing in foreign language)

47:22.073 --> 47:24.941
        (camera clicks)

47:24.943 --> 47:26.509
    - You wanna see it?

47:26.511 --> 47:28.177
        It's kinda cute.

47:28.179 --> 47:29.312
        - It's cute.

47:29.314 --> 47:31.480
            (laughs)

47:33.318 --> 47:37.253
(speaking foreign language)

47:41.860 --> 47:42.558
        - Well, listen.

47:43.895 --> 47:45.628
    $40 million, that's
    a lot of renmimbes,

47:45.630 --> 47:48.297
so let's just not screw this up.

47:49.067 --> 47:51.067
        (laughing)

47:51.069 --> 47:54.070
(speaking foreign language)

47:54.072 --> 47:55.438
            Okay.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.539
        All right.

47:56.541 --> 47:57.640
        Okay, sorry.

47:57.642 --> 47:59.408
            Hi.
            - Hi.

47:59.410 --> 48:00.409
            - Hi.

48:01.412 --> 48:03.279
    You must be Andy.

48:03.281 --> 48:04.447
        - Hi, yeah.

48:04.449 --> 48:05.448
        How are you?

48:05.450 --> 48:07.450
            - Hi.

48:07.451 --> 48:09.451
- I know we just met, and
it's not my place to criticize,

48:09.454 --> 48:11.988
but your Cantonese is bad.

48:11.990 --> 48:13.522
    - Mm, well then it
    was a good thing

48:13.524 --> 48:16.092
    I was speaking
    Mandarin, isn't it?

48:16.094 --> 48:18.127
        (laughing)

48:18.129 --> 48:20.162
        (mumbling)

48:20.164 --> 48:21.497
        (laughing)

48:21.499 --> 48:25.001
    - So, how was the opera
    for the first time?

48:25.904 --> 48:27.336
        This season.
        - Great.

48:27.338 --> 48:28.638
    - The first season.

48:28.640 --> 48:29.972
            - Yeah.

48:29.974 --> 48:31.073
            - Yeah.

48:31.075 --> 48:33.109
    It was fun, brilliant,
    if anything.

48:34.345 --> 48:38.514
Not as good as the
Zepheretti we saw last year.

48:38.516 --> 48:40.149
    - The Zepheretti, right.

48:40.151 --> 48:44.120
- Yeah, I love
Zepheretti, he's amazing.

48:44.122 --> 48:45.354
        - Really?
        - You too.

48:45.356 --> 48:48.624
    Yeah, especially
    La Bohama, right?

48:48.626 --> 48:51.527
    - La Bohama is just--
    - It's stunning.

48:51.529 --> 48:54.063
        Absolutely.
        - Maybe.

48:54.065 --> 48:55.431
            - Yeah.

48:55.433 --> 48:58.401
    - So, we didn't
    mean to disturb you,

48:58.403 --> 49:02.305
    but you had a business
    call, what do you do?

49:02.307 --> 49:05.074
- Oh, a hedge fund manager.

49:06.444 --> 49:11.013
- Oh, so you handle like,
investments with you know,

49:12.317 --> 49:14.517
with other people's money
in different fields.

49:14.519 --> 49:15.651
            - Yes.

49:15.653 --> 49:17.019
        Yes, I do.

49:17.021 --> 49:20.523
    Primarily high
    risk VCs, you know,

49:20.525 --> 49:22.058
    thinking outside
    the box type stuff,

49:22.060 --> 49:23.459
a lot of it very cutting edge.

49:23.461 --> 49:26.395
    It's not safe, so that
    is what makes it fun.

49:26.397 --> 49:27.430
    - [Andy] I've heard.

49:27.432 --> 49:28.531
    - She's important.

49:28.533 --> 49:29.465
            - Yeah.

49:30.435 --> 49:32.668
        (clears throat)

49:32.670 --> 49:36.339
    - And you, Andy, what
    exactly do you do?

49:36.341 --> 49:41.344
- Oh, I'm hotel business,
it's, I don't, it's a lot.

49:43.114 --> 49:45.381
    I mean, maybe if we,
    you know, talk later

49:45.383 --> 49:46.582
I can give you more details.

49:46.584 --> 49:49.518
    But it's just, yeah,
    hotel business.

49:50.588 --> 49:55.257
    - Okay, well I'm bushed,
    so we'll talk later

49:55.259 --> 50:00.329
about that hotel business,
and you guys just

50:01.532 --> 50:04.467
enjoy yourselves, 'cause I'm
gonna sleep in your bedroom,

50:04.469 --> 50:05.568
        if that's okay.

50:05.570 --> 50:08.137
    - That's fine,
    anything that you need

50:08.139 --> 50:10.473
is more than okay with me.

50:10.475 --> 50:12.475
    I just want you to
    get back on your feet.

50:12.477 --> 50:15.511
    - Yes, okay, got it,
    yes, uh-huh, thank you.

50:15.513 --> 50:18.280
    And yeah, you kids
    need anything,

50:18.282 --> 50:19.548
    just help yourselves.

50:21.753 --> 50:23.552
    - Did she just say
    that we could have

50:23.554 --> 50:26.489
whatever we want in your house?

50:26.491 --> 50:27.590
        - Did she?

50:27.592 --> 50:28.691
            No.

50:28.693 --> 50:29.525
            Really?

50:29.527 --> 50:30.760
            (laughs)

50:30.762 --> 50:32.495
    Her sense of humor's
    really really strange,

50:32.497 --> 50:33.562
    but I find it funny.

50:36.768 --> 50:38.367
            Okay.

50:38.369 --> 50:40.202
            (sighs)

50:40.204 --> 50:41.303
    - I gotta come clean.

50:47.278 --> 50:48.144
            - Okay.

50:51.516 --> 50:52.515
            (sighs)

50:52.517 --> 50:53.616
- I've never been to the opera.

50:53.618 --> 50:55.217
        (laughing)

50:55.219 --> 50:56.519
        - Oh my god.

50:56.521 --> 50:59.288
That's not what I thought
you were gonna say.

50:59.290 --> 51:01.390
    - [Andy] Whew, okay.

51:01.392 --> 51:03.159
- Okay, but I actually
do have something serious

51:03.161 --> 51:04.226
    to tell you, though.

51:06.097 --> 51:07.530
    I feel like I've
    been a little bit

51:07.532 --> 51:08.798
misleading about something.

51:10.101 --> 51:11.834
I don't know who Zepheretti is

51:11.836 --> 51:13.602
and I've never heard of him...

51:15.807 --> 51:17.173
            What?

51:17.175 --> 51:19.642
- No, I just told you that, no.

51:19.644 --> 51:23.779
- Is the La Bohama thing, shh,
is La Bohama a real thing?

51:23.781 --> 51:25.314
        - I don't know.

51:25.316 --> 51:26.615
    - I thought you
    knew what that was.

51:26.617 --> 51:27.716
    - It probably is.

51:27.718 --> 51:28.551
    Where's your bathroom?

51:28.553 --> 51:29.718
        (laughing)

51:29.720 --> 51:33.089
- It's down there, to the right.

51:34.358 --> 51:35.257
            Okay.

51:36.227 --> 51:37.193
        Yeah, good.

51:41.566 --> 51:44.567
        (light music)

51:44.569 --> 51:46.635
            (sighs)

51:57.348 --> 51:59.615
    - I like this girl.

51:59.617 --> 52:01.550
            (sighs)

52:01.552 --> 52:03.619
    I really like this girl.

52:05.823 --> 52:07.590
    Don't let me down.

52:10.595 --> 52:11.494
            Sorry.

52:12.597 --> 52:13.529
            - Hey.

52:14.332 --> 52:16.699
I was gonna go get us a drink.

52:18.603 --> 52:20.836
        (R&B music)

52:30.248 --> 52:32.481
    ¶ Having shots, saying
    is that deep enough ¶

52:32.483 --> 52:33.782
        - I don't care.

52:34.685 --> 52:36.352
            (laughs)

52:36.354 --> 52:41.423
¶ Seven minutes more
gonna be seven too much ¶

52:42.627 --> 52:46.662
¶ Dirty minds think alike,
you ain't gotta say nothing ¶

52:47.865 --> 52:52.668
¶ We made it to the floor,
now we can't get up ¶

52:53.671 --> 52:56.572
    ¶ Just move with me,
    get loose with me ¶

52:56.574 --> 52:59.909
¶ Show me what you're gonna do ¶

52:59.911 --> 53:02.745
    ¶ Come through it,
    pass through it ¶

53:02.747 --> 53:04.647
    ¶ You some got facts,
    I got 'em too ¶

53:04.649 --> 53:08.784
    ¶ You got me like
    oh, oh, oh, oh ¶

53:39.550 --> 53:41.617
            (moans)

53:47.692 --> 53:49.592
            (yawns)

53:49.594 --> 53:50.492
        - Good morning.

53:51.729 --> 53:52.861
    - Sorry, did I wake you?

53:57.501 --> 53:58.234
            - No.

53:58.235 --> 53:58.968
    - How come Sasha's
    in all these photos

53:58.970 --> 54:01.403
and you're in none of 'em?

54:03.574 --> 54:06.909
    - Oh, that's just,
    it's a weird thing,

54:06.911 --> 54:10.546
    I just don't like posing
    for photos, like at all.

54:10.548 --> 54:13.782
So she just stands in for me.

54:16.654 --> 54:18.787
    - [Andy] So these
    are your parents?

54:18.789 --> 54:20.389
    - [Hayley] Yep, yeah.

54:21.492 --> 54:24.760
    - You don't look
    anything like them.

54:24.762 --> 54:25.794
        (laughing)

54:25.796 --> 54:28.931
    - That's just, I
    think I look like

54:28.933 --> 54:32.835
    my grandfather George,
    god rest his soul.

54:33.838 --> 54:36.605
- So this must be your husband.

54:37.875 --> 54:38.841
        - No, no.

54:39.910 --> 54:41.610
        That's Devon.

54:42.713 --> 54:47.650
    He's away on business,
    so, but you'll meet him.

54:50.955 --> 54:52.004
            - Oh.

54:52.005 --> 54:53.054
So that means you're planning on

54:53.057 --> 54:54.890
keeping me around for a while?

54:54.892 --> 54:56.659
    - I don't know, maybe.

54:56.661 --> 55:01.664
            Yeah.

55:07.305 --> 55:09.872
        (phone ringing)

55:12.610 --> 55:17.012
- It's a call from the
company, I gotta take this.

55:17.014 --> 55:17.946
        - [Hayley] Okay.

55:17.948 --> 55:20.516
- [Andy] I'll be right back.

55:28.826 --> 55:31.827
        (exhales)

55:31.829 --> 55:32.895
        - Mr. Warren.

55:32.897 --> 55:34.396
        How are you sir?

55:34.398 --> 55:35.931
    - Are you in a bathroom?

55:35.933 --> 55:38.901
    - Look, I'm at the gym.

55:40.037 --> 55:41.670
    On the way to work.

55:41.672 --> 55:43.839
- I don't really care
where you are, I'm worried.

55:43.841 --> 55:45.708
I've been doing the
downward dog all morning,

55:45.710 --> 55:47.042
and all I can think about is you

55:47.044 --> 55:48.744
    and why I haven't heard
    from you in two days.

55:48.746 --> 55:50.412
Anything I should know about?

55:50.414 --> 55:51.847
            - No.

55:51.849 --> 55:55.384
    No, sir, everything
    is, it feels great.

55:55.386 --> 55:56.852
            (sighs)

55:56.854 --> 55:59.054
- Have you heard from Roman
about the acquisitions?

55:59.056 --> 56:00.456
        - No, sir.

56:00.458 --> 56:02.891
    But I've reached
    out multiple times.

56:02.893 --> 56:04.209
        (moaning)

56:04.210 --> 56:05.526
    - Well light some fire
    under their asses,

56:05.529 --> 56:08.630
        get this thing--
        (loud moaning)

56:10.534 --> 56:14.770
            - Sir...

56:14.772 --> 56:16.038
    - Is everything okay?

56:17.041 --> 56:19.742
        (Andy sighs)

56:19.744 --> 56:20.609
            - Yeah.

56:22.913 --> 56:24.680
    Everything's good.

56:25.883 --> 56:28.684
I just had a few wrinkles
on a hotel acquisition.

56:28.686 --> 56:30.953
    - Oh, acquire a hotel?

56:31.889 --> 56:34.056
    - I have this idea.
    - Mm-hmm.

56:34.058 --> 56:39.061
- Where I wanna create hotels
that are more like apartments.

56:39.964 --> 56:43.098
    Instead of hotel rooms
    where the interior

56:43.100 --> 56:47.035
    the decor is casual,
    instead of room service

56:47.037 --> 56:49.972
    you're having a
    fridge in your place

56:49.974 --> 56:53.475
    with beer and hot
    pockets. (laughs)

56:53.477 --> 56:54.910
        Stuff like that.

56:54.912 --> 56:57.045
    And the staff, they're
    all your friends

56:57.047 --> 56:58.647
    and they're dressed
    in street clothes

56:58.649 --> 57:02.918
instead of bell hop uniforms,
and it's just a cool,

57:02.920 --> 57:04.953
    casual place that
    feels like home,

57:04.955 --> 57:06.855
    but it just happens
    to be a hotel.

57:08.592 --> 57:10.826
    Yeah, I'm gonna
    call it Crash Pad.

57:13.931 --> 57:14.763
        It's a bad idea.

57:14.765 --> 57:15.964
            - No.

57:15.966 --> 57:17.666
    Actually reminds me a
    little bit of something

57:17.668 --> 57:19.568
    that I'm working on.

57:22.840 --> 57:24.790
        - [Andy] Really?

57:24.791 --> 57:26.741
    - I want to open up a
    full service bar salon

57:26.744 --> 57:27.743
    that's more social.

57:30.047 --> 57:31.847
- When you say full service.

57:31.849 --> 57:33.048
        (laughing)

57:33.050 --> 57:33.982
        - Shut up!

57:33.984 --> 57:38.954
Seriously, like, when you
go to get your hair done

57:38.956 --> 57:41.023
    or whatever at a salon,
    everyone's chatting,

57:41.025 --> 57:42.691
    they're gossiping,
    it's like communal,

57:42.693 --> 57:44.493
but when you go to a spa, it's,

57:44.495 --> 57:47.029
    like to get a body
    scrub or a massage,

57:47.031 --> 57:48.831
    you're just so isolated.

57:48.833 --> 57:50.632
So I wanna combine them both.

57:50.634 --> 57:52.568
    I wanna have like
    a bar and a buffet,

57:52.570 --> 57:57.172
and just make it like a more
social experience, I guess.

57:57.174 --> 57:58.974
    Kind of like Cheers
    but for women.

57:58.976 --> 58:00.876
- So what are you gonna call it?

58:01.645 --> 58:02.945
        - Community Zen.

58:04.081 --> 58:05.013
            - Ah.

58:06.517 --> 58:08.016
- Oh no, do you think I'm crazy?

58:08.018 --> 58:09.818
            - No.

58:09.820 --> 58:11.587
I think you're zensational.

58:11.589 --> 58:13.589
        (laughing)

58:13.591 --> 58:14.756
You see what I did there?

58:14.758 --> 58:15.691
            - Yeah.

58:15.693 --> 58:17.726
Yeah, that's very clever.

58:19.029 --> 58:21.096
            (sighs)

58:21.966 --> 58:23.098
    I'm afraid of you.

58:24.635 --> 58:25.534
            - Good.

58:28.272 --> 58:31.006
    'Cause if you're
    falling for me half

58:31.008 --> 58:36.078
as hard as I'm falling for
you, then we're in big trouble.

58:38.048 --> 58:40.749
        (gentle music)

58:49.994 --> 58:51.927
    I wanna stay, trust
    me, I wanna stay.

58:53.163 --> 58:54.096
            - Okay.

58:55.032 --> 58:56.698
    Go acquire a hotel.

58:56.700 --> 58:58.767
            (laughs)

59:01.605 --> 59:03.739
    - Do you have any
    plans tomorrow?

59:03.741 --> 59:06.108
    - Did you have
    something in mind?

59:06.110 --> 59:07.175
            - Maybe.

59:08.812 --> 59:10.946
I wanna take you somewhere.

59:10.948 --> 59:12.748
    And it requires skill.

59:14.118 --> 59:15.684
            - Okay.

59:15.686 --> 59:18.320
    - [Andy] We'll see
    if you're up to par.

59:19.557 --> 59:24.626
            - Oh.

59:25.129 --> 59:26.895
        (giggles)

59:32.236 --> 59:34.670
- Oh, good morning, Princess.

59:34.672 --> 59:36.171
        (laughing)

59:36.173 --> 59:37.940
    Details, details,
    details, 'cause like,

59:37.942 --> 59:39.641
    Grandpa George, really?

59:39.643 --> 59:41.176
- What was I supposed to do?

59:41.178 --> 59:42.244
I'm not in any of the photos.

59:42.246 --> 59:43.645
- And whose fault is that?

59:43.647 --> 59:44.980
    - Well we did not
    think that through.

59:44.982 --> 59:46.114
I did not think that through.

59:46.116 --> 59:48.200
        (laughing)

59:48.201 --> 59:50.285
    - So did we give the
    American a good wank?

59:50.287 --> 59:51.119
        - [Hayley] Stop.

59:51.121 --> 59:52.187
        - Did we?

59:53.223 --> 59:54.623
    Come on, spill it.

59:57.828 --> 59:58.994
        - It was great.

59:58.996 --> 01:00:01.697
It was amazing, it was amazing.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:02.965
    We were amazing, I
    mean, the whole thing

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:04.366
    was just really amazing.

01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:06.768
    In like a lot of ways.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:07.703
    - Was it amazing?

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:08.637
- [Hayley] It was amazing.

01:00:08.639 --> 01:00:09.938
- Yeah, I'm getting that.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.673
- Yeah, you know last
night with the opera talk?

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:13.108
    Yeah, it was his first
    time at the opera.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.944
        - Oh, really?
        (laughing)

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.346
    La Bohama my ass.

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:22.384
        You're smitten.

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:24.119
            - I am.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:26.388
- Mm, that initial little
pitter patter of feelings

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.156
    that if we could just
    bottle up and sell,

01:00:28.158 --> 01:00:29.358
we would be millionaires.

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:33.128
        (laughing)

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.196
    - Oh, I'm pathetic
    though, aren't?

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:36.231
- No, not exactly pathetic.

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:39.401
You're at the intersection
of pathetic and cute.

01:00:39.403 --> 01:00:40.869
        (laughing)

01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:43.338
    And I'm happy for
    you, but you do know

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.674
that he thinks he's
dating the owner and boss

01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:47.075
    of a series of spas.

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:49.177
        - I know.

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:50.646
    What am I gonna do?

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:52.047
    - You gotta tell him.

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:53.148
        - I can't!

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.117
- You gotta just spit it out.

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.151
    Every pun intended.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.853
        (laughing)

01:00:57.855 --> 01:00:59.254
        - Oh my god.

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:02.224
    - Oh, you ridiculous
    petulant little child.

01:01:02.226 --> 01:01:03.225
        God, whatever.

01:01:03.227 --> 01:01:04.159
        It's your life.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.661
I'm gonna make us some tea.

01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:06.828
            - Okay.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:07.963
    - And you're gonna
    wash the sheets.

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:08.730
            - Oh.

01:01:08.732 --> 01:01:10.866
    - [Sasha] No, seriously,
    wash the sheets.

01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:11.933
    - I'll wash the sheets.

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:13.368
        - [Sasha] Yeah.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:15.103
        (light music)

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.238
- Here it comes, you ready?

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:19.975
    Okay, you gotta keep
    your eye on the ball,

01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:21.176
    that's all I know
    what to tell ya.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:22.944
            - Okay.

01:01:22.946 --> 01:01:24.212
    - Hey, I got an idea.

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:25.781
    Why don't you guys
    come and hang with us

01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:27.182
at the beach house this weekend?

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:28.250
        - Really?

01:01:28.252 --> 01:01:29.751
            - Yes.

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:31.286
Check in with Hayley, see
if she's down with it.

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:33.422
- Yeah, but what about Ava?

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:37.159
    I mean, does she
    know what's going on?

01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:39.294
'Cause if we go, then I mean,
you both are gonna have to--

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:40.929
    - Lie about your
    professional life?

01:01:40.931 --> 01:01:42.230
    Look, I don't think
    she's gonna do that,

01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:44.299
    but I'll make sure she
    keeps her mouth shut.

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:45.400
            - Okay.

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:47.069
        Thanks, man.
        - Yeah.

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:47.936
            Oh.

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:50.305
You're not so great at this.

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:51.740
    - [Andy] Maybe one more.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.744
    - Yeah, let's go do a
    little putt putt golf.

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:57.779
    Come on, Babe Ruth.

01:01:57.781 --> 01:01:58.413
        - I hate you.

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:04.386
        (birds chirping)

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:07.055
        (laughing)

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.256
    - Real skill, huh?

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:09.291
        - Hell yes.

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:10.225
        (giggles)

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.426
- [Clerk] Hi, two for mini golf?

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:12.427
        - Yes, please.

01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:17.065
        (camera clicks)

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:21.169
Learn to golf, and to golf well.

01:02:21.171 --> 01:02:23.271
- Wait, did you just quote--

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:24.272
            - Huh?

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:25.340
        - Nevermind.

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:28.176
- Here's your score card.

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:29.244
    - [Hayley] Thank you.

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:30.245
    - You guys are so cute.

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:31.379
    - Aww, appreciate that.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:32.514
        - You're cute.

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:36.384
        - You're cute.
        (laughs)

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:38.053
    - Yes, Mr. Dumpty.

01:02:38.055 --> 01:02:41.289
    (camera clicking)
    (laughing)

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:42.958
            - Okay.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.360
    So, you can take it.

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:46.862
            - Okay.

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:49.197
- So what you're gonna do

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:51.299
    is you are going
    to move your arms.

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.167
        - Uh-huh.

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:53.235
    - And your shoulders.

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:54.302
            - Right.

01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:56.438
    - Together, like
    a pendulum, okay?

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.405
            - Okay.

01:02:57.407 --> 01:03:00.342
- Gorgeous velvet pendulum.

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:01.977
        - Okay, okay.

01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:02.811
    - Okay, you got it.

01:03:02.813 --> 01:03:04.012
    - Just watch and learn.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:10.919
            - Okay.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.552
        - Yeah, I learnt
        how to play golf

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:13.989
    before you discovered
    pocket pool.

01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:15.390
Just be grateful we're
not on a real golf course

01:03:15.392 --> 01:03:17.926
    'cause I mean really
    embarrass you.

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:21.897
            - Noted.

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:23.298
    - Yeah, you'll be fine.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.299
        - Thank you.
        - Yeah.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:27.369
    (camera clicking)

01:03:32.376 --> 01:03:33.942
        - Here you go.

01:03:33.944 --> 01:03:35.010
        - Thank you.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.380
There's no way this is right.

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:41.383
    - Well, with the nine
    mulligans I gave you

01:03:41.385 --> 01:03:43.952
    and the penalty strikes
    that I did not add,

01:03:43.954 --> 01:03:46.188
    because you thought that
    getting your ball lost

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.323
    in the windmill
    was penalty enough.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.391
    All of that is correct.

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:51.993
            - Okay.

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:52.894
        That it is.

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:56.398
        - Traumatized?

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.432
            - No.

01:03:57.434 --> 01:03:58.333
            Yes.

01:03:58.335 --> 01:03:59.568
        (laughing)

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:01.069
    I just don't think I've
    ever been so thoroughly

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:03.572
emasculated in my entire life.

01:04:03.574 --> 01:04:04.406
        - I'm sorry.

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:05.407
    - You're not sorry.

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:06.274
            - No.

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:07.175
            - Mm-mm.
            - Mm-mm.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:11.947
- What are you doing tomorrow?

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.515
- Nothing I can't move around.

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:16.835
            Why?

01:04:16.836 --> 01:04:18.186
- 'Cause maybe I wanna see you.

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:19.020
            - Yeah?

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.355
    - Take you somewhere.

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:22.090
            - Where?

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:23.859
- Definitely not mini golf.

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:24.926
        (laughing)

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:26.461
    - Yeah, we won't do
    mini golf anymore.

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:27.696
        - Never again.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:28.930
    - No, it didn't
    make you look good.

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:29.431
            - No.

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:31.266
        It's messed up.

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:32.133
            - Yeah.

01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:40.175
        (knocking)

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:41.042
        - [Peter] Yeah.

01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:43.478
            - Peter.

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:46.047
        How we doing?

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:48.049
- Fine, what do you have?

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:49.451
- This just came up from legal,

01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:51.653
    they said everything
    is copacetic,

01:04:51.655 --> 01:04:53.421
    but Mr. Warren would
    feel better if--

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:54.389
        - Yeah, yeah.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:55.590
I'll take a look, thank you.

01:04:58.295 --> 01:04:59.160
        Anything else?

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:02.497
            (laughs)

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:04.299
    - I wanna talk to
    you about an idea

01:05:04.301 --> 01:05:05.400
that I've been working on.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:06.468
        - An idea?

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:14.409
- It's a new hotel chain.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:16.378
    - Do you know how
    much effort it takes

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:19.114
    to make a proposal
    for a new hotel chain?

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:20.982
    To even build one?

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:22.117
            - I do.

01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:25.587
    But this is great.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:29.658
- Look, everyone knows Mr.
Warren sees something in you

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.993
    that no one else sees.

01:05:32.963 --> 01:05:34.529
But that'll take you so far.

01:05:34.531 --> 01:05:36.464
It you got in this conversation.

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:39.701
But all due diligence,
you gotta start hustling,

01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:42.037
    or this is how far
    you're gonna get.

01:05:44.241 --> 01:05:46.074
            (sighs)

01:05:46.076 --> 01:05:46.608
        Goodbye Andy.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.347
            - Mia?

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:53.248
            - What?

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:58.253
- I was just wondering if you
could give me some advice?

01:05:58.255 --> 01:06:00.405
            - On?

01:06:00.406 --> 01:06:02.556
- I have this idea about
starting up a spa, like yours.

01:06:05.262 --> 01:06:07.562
    - Well this should be
    interesting, go on.

01:06:07.564 --> 01:06:10.632
- No, not, I mean, vastly
different to yours,

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:13.168
    like considerably
    different to yours,

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:17.105
    but I was just, how did
    you start this place up?

01:06:17.107 --> 01:06:20.108
    Like did you get an
    LLC, where did you get

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.110
the startup funds for it?

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:24.346
    - You do realize you're
    asking your current boss

01:06:24.348 --> 01:06:25.447
    how to start a
    business that will

01:06:25.449 --> 01:06:27.315
directly compete with hers?

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.483
        - Oh no no.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.618
    Oh no, it's just a
    hypothetical, it's not--

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.354
    - Should I start looking
    for your replacement?

01:06:32.356 --> 01:06:33.588
            - No.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:35.223
    No, definitely not.

01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:39.427
'Cause I'm asking for the
future, like a galaxy far away.

01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:43.465
Not now is what I'm saying,
like not now at all.

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:45.734
    So, I really
    appreciate the advice.

01:06:45.736 --> 01:06:47.369
    Have a lovely weekend.

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:51.639
    Just not now, is, yeah.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:56.211
        (laughing)

01:06:57.247 --> 01:06:59.114
- I hope you guys are ready
for an amazing weekend

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:00.282
        at the beach.

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:01.449
Andy, thanks for the limo.

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:03.218
    - No no, it's the
    least that we can do.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.552
    - Honey, did I tell you?

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:06.388
    Andy's company's picking
    up the limo ride for us.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:07.555
    - Isn't that a personal
    expense, though?

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:09.157
    Are your shareholders
    okay with that?

01:07:09.159 --> 01:07:11.626
    - How many shareholders
    is it that you have?

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:13.111
        I forget.

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:14.595
- Honey, we don't wanna
talk about this boring stuff

01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:16.464
when there's a lot of expensive
champagne to be drinking.

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:19.200
    - No champagne, no
    champagne, no shop talk,

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:20.769
    let's just sit back
    and enjoy the ride.

01:07:20.771 --> 01:07:22.070
        - Okay, okay.

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:24.606
        (light music)

01:07:36.787 --> 01:07:38.753
    - Come on in, make
    yourselves at home.

01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:43.825
- Wow, this is your house?

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:47.162
- [Blake] No, technically
it's our house.

01:07:47.164 --> 01:07:48.430
    - (Woman speaking foreign
            language)

01:07:48.432 --> 01:07:50.131
    Something what do
    you guys wanna do?

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:51.499
    - I wanna get some sun.

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:53.435
    - Oh yeah, you could
    us a little sun

01:07:53.437 --> 01:07:55.203
    on that pasty white
    butt of yours.

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:56.638
        (laughing)

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:58.072
    - [Hayley] Wow, that
    pool is amazing.

01:07:58.073 --> 01:07:59.506
- Listen, why don't you guys
just chill out a little bit

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:01.109
    and we'll go and have
    some dinner, okay?

01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:03.311
    - And I have an idea for
    tomorrow, so let's talk.

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:05.680
        (light music)

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:22.596
    - This guy, right?

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:23.598
            (laughs)

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.432
            - What?

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:25.265
        - What, what?

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:26.501
    What, you know what.

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:27.669
- You're smitten over her.

01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:30.104
    Not that I blame
    you, she's adorable.

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:32.607
- You're falling for this girl.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:34.542
- Fallen, this is past tense.

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:35.443
        - Really?

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.611
    - Yeah, that was fast.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.613
    - I know, I'm sold.

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:39.848
        - Good for you.

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:42.117
- Somebody's a little P-whipped.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.618
Right, Mr. P. Whipped over here.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.551
        (Andy laughs)

01:08:44.554 --> 01:08:45.620
    We got Mr. P. Whip--

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.822
    - It's the accent,
    it's priceless.

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:51.626
    - No, it's just, she's
    everything I wanna be.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.661
- What, like a fraud and a liar?

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.013
            - Wow.

01:08:55.014 --> 01:08:56.363
    - Come on, I'm just
    saying, when you gonna

01:08:56.366 --> 01:08:57.298
    tell her the truth?

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:00.033
        - I don't know.

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:01.768
I mean, maybe when I feel
like I'm not gonna lose her

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.254
    when she finds out.

01:09:03.255 --> 01:09:04.738
- You'll never know until
you tell her the truth.

01:09:04.741 --> 01:09:07.308
    You're not the first guy
    to do something stupid

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.609
    because you wanna
    impress a girl.

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:09.777
- What are you talking about?

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:11.513
        (laughing)

01:09:11.515 --> 01:09:12.647
    Was she looking at me?

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:13.715
            Huh?

01:09:14.584 --> 01:09:16.818
            (groans)

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:17.719
            - Jeez.

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:21.788
        (birds chirping)

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.292
    Andy, what is going on?

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:25.693
    I have left you
    over 20 messages.

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:26.928
    Call me immediately.

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:30.732

    ¶ Where the wild
    grass grows high ¶

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.682
¶ Where life is a miracle ¶

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:50.285
        ¶ And they never
        really ask why ¶

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:52.319
¶ Can I get a ride down there ¶

01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:54.455
¶ Need a bit of action, I know ¶

01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:56.391
¶ Take me to the danger ¶

01:09:56.393 --> 01:09:58.693
¶ Show me how the party goes ¶

01:09:58.695 --> 01:09:59.827
            ¶ Oh ¶

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:04.766
    ¶ You have come too
    far away from home ¶

01:10:05.468 --> 01:10:06.901
    - I cannot believe
    me talked him into

01:10:06.903 --> 01:10:08.737
taking dance lessons right now.

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:10.572
- You've had a few drinks,
we're gonna have a good time.

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:11.806
- Thank god we've had drinks.

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:12.707
        (laughing)

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:13.708
    - You're okay with this?

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:14.709
    - Are you kidding?

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:15.810
        This is awesome.

01:10:15.812 --> 01:10:16.744
    Come on, let's go.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:18.379
        Let's go.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:19.347

¶ Shake it up into the night ¶

¶ Remember the days I
prayed for what I have now ¶

01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:41.669
¶ Ivy league law friends,
dreams and cocktails ¶

good times and the best times ¶

            - Hey.

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:12.867
            - Hmm?

01:11:12.869 --> 01:11:14.002
        - We're home.

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:17.038
            Hey.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.007
    We're gonna step out,
    guys, this is us.

01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:20.408
            - Okay.

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:22.477
    - I had a great time,
    had a great time.

01:11:22.479 --> 01:11:23.711
        Have fun.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:24.979
- Thanks for everything, buddy.

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:26.781
    - Thank you again.

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:27.882
    - [Ava] Good night.

01:11:27.884 --> 01:11:29.017
        - Good night.

        (light music)

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:45.033
    - I don't want this
    weekend to end.

01:11:45.035 --> 01:11:45.900
            - Yeah.

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:48.870
    It doesn't have to.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:50.905
        - Really?

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:55.877
    - Have you ever had
    a Neapolitan orgasm?

01:11:57.514 --> 01:11:59.314
    - It's always been
    on my to do list.

01:11:59.316 --> 01:12:01.049
        (laughing)

01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:04.452
    - Well, some would
    call it Italian food.

01:12:05.522 --> 01:12:06.921
- Yeah, I'd like to do that.

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:09.957
            - Gary.

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:12.860
        Take us Patsy's.

        (clapping)

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:30.745
            - Wow.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:35.116
    Italian orgasm of
    the soul indeed.

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:37.352
    - Oh, but it's
    not Italian, it's,

01:12:38.555 --> 01:12:40.955
    Tony, will you remind
    her what this is?

01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:44.392
    - It's Neapolitan.

01:12:44.394 --> 01:12:47.929
    Chef Boyardee in a
    can is Italian food.

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:50.865
Sal isn't with us this evening.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:53.368
    However, I would like
    to present to you both

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:55.503
a copy of his latest book.

01:12:55.505 --> 01:12:59.407
    May our recipes become
    your family dinners.

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:03.611
- So nice of you, thank you.

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:05.513
(speaks foreign language)

01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:06.948
        (laughing)

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:07.815
        - Get it?

01:13:07.817 --> 01:13:08.983
    I crack myself up.

01:13:11.421 --> 01:13:14.389
    - It's our first
    communal property.

01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:17.592
            (laughs)

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:19.627
        Come here.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:23.965
        Thank you.

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:27.435
    For dinner, and
    for this weekend.

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:33.141
Okay, I'm gonna go use the
lady's, I'll be right back.

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:40.648
    - Tony, can I get
    the check, please?

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:46.120
    Here you go, my friend.
    - Ah.

01:13:49.726 --> 01:13:52.794
    (suspenseful music)

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:59.500
    - I am sorry, but...

01:14:00.737 --> 01:14:02.770
    - I'm assuming this
    meal has nothing to do

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:05.039
with official hotel business.

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:06.808
Am I wrong in that assumption?

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:09.644
- What are you doing here?

01:14:09.646 --> 01:14:11.045
    - Just making sure
    Mr. Warren knows

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:12.880
that you are not to be trusted.

01:14:14.017 --> 01:14:18.786
Oh, you would never use the
company credit card, would you?

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:19.887
            - Oh.

01:14:21.057 --> 01:14:22.957
    I'm so sorry, that
    was a mistake.

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:25.126
    I'm gonna go ahead and
    leave cash, thanks.

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:29.497
    - Give my regards
    to your girlfriend.

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:31.599
    And I hope you
    brought enough cash.

01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:33.167
        (chuckles)

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:36.137
    I can't wait for Mr.
    Warren to come home.

01:14:37.207 --> 01:14:41.142
    Limos, yachts,
    expensive dinners?

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:44.579
        Dumpty Dumpty.

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:47.048
    The point is, you're
    in a lot of trouble!

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:55.690
            - Hey.

01:14:55.692 --> 01:14:56.757
        - [Andy] Hey.

01:14:56.759 --> 01:14:57.592
        - You okay?

01:14:57.594 --> 01:14:58.526
    - Yeah, everything's--

01:14:58.528 --> 01:15:00.061
- Are we good, are we set?

01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:02.830
- Yeah, I just, why don't
you meet me in the limo?

01:15:03.967 --> 01:15:05.666
    And yeah, I wanna
    do one more thing.

01:15:06.236 --> 01:15:07.134
            - Okay.

01:15:09.272 --> 01:15:11.005
    Don't forget that.

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:12.006
    - I'm not going to.

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:14.108
            (laughs)

01:15:17.046 --> 01:15:19.814
        (light music)

01:15:42.672 --> 01:15:43.571
            - Hi.

01:15:43.573 --> 01:15:44.906
        - Oh, hi.

01:15:44.908 --> 01:15:47.108
    - Gary, take us home.

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:50.278
            (sighs)

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:57.652
    - Thank you for dinner.

01:15:58.688 --> 01:16:00.054
    - You're welcome.

01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:02.056
    I'm sorry, come here.

01:16:07.697 --> 01:16:08.596
            Kevin.

01:16:09.299 --> 01:16:11.032
        Good morning.

01:16:11.034 --> 01:16:12.033
        We should talk.

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:13.701
        - Not a good day
        for you, Dumpty.

01:16:14.837 --> 01:16:17.104
    I just got off a Skype
    call with Mr. Warren.

01:16:17.106 --> 01:16:20.841
And Gina, up in accounting,
all those expenses

01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:22.276
    that you've rung up?

01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:25.079
        (exhaling)

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:26.080
    - What are you doing?

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:27.080
- [Kevin] I'm trying to whistle.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:27.949
    - That's not a whistle.

01:16:27.951 --> 01:16:28.916
    - That's not the point.

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:31.152
    The card, please?

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:37.758
        Thank you.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.361
    Mr. Warren would
    like you to go home,

01:16:40.363 --> 01:16:43.664
    and he will deal with
    you when he returns.

01:16:43.666 --> 01:16:44.265
    - Kevin, you're not--

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:45.800
    - I don't wanna hear it.

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:48.803
    - You can't fire me.

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:50.204
    - That's correct.

01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:54.175
But I can suspend you, and
that's what I'm doing right now.

01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:55.042
    - Just because I--

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:56.978
        - Just because!

01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:00.982
    Corporate fraud is
    not a just because.

01:17:00.984 --> 01:17:03.718
    You have always been
    a world class slacker,

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.786
    but congratulations.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:10.858
You have just graduated to an
epic screw-up, and a criminal.

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:15.763
If it was up to me I would
send you to jail today,

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:19.233
but Mr. Warren insisted that
he takes care of it himself.

01:17:20.203 --> 01:17:21.636
    But don't fret, Dumpty.

01:17:21.638 --> 01:17:26.407
We'll survive just fine
without the lackluster services

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:28.242
    of our hotel greeter.

01:17:29.212 --> 01:17:30.211
    - A hotel greeter?

01:17:31.047 --> 01:17:32.847
        - Oh yes.

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:34.115
    And a bad one at that.

01:17:35.752 --> 01:17:38.152
    - Ooh, what's he
    talking about, Andy?

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:39.920
- [Andy] Nothing, he's just--

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:41.155
- You told you were the manager.

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:41.989
            (laughs)

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:43.090
        - He did?

01:17:43.092 --> 01:17:45.092
    Oh, that's funny.

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:47.328
        (laughing)

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:48.996
        That's funny.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.866
    Because I'm the manager.

01:17:56.806 --> 01:17:58.272
        - Is that true?

01:17:58.274 --> 01:18:00.307
            (sighs)

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:02.276
            - Yes.

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.112
    - You lied to me?

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:09.083
            (crying)

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:11.719
        (solemn music)

01:18:13.756 --> 01:18:14.388
        - Hayley, wait.

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:15.690
    - Don't touch me!

01:18:15.692 --> 01:18:16.390
            - Okay.

01:18:17.694 --> 01:18:22.129
    I'm sorry, but, you
    gotta let me explain.

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:23.264
        - Explain what?

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.299
    Explain what, Andy?

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:29.937
Every single moment that you
and I have spent together

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:31.972
        has been a lie.

01:18:31.974 --> 01:18:33.974
    - I wanted to tell
    you the truth, but--

01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:35.209
        - [Hayley] But?

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:37.445
    - But I thought you
    would leave me, okay?

01:18:37.447 --> 01:18:38.879
        I thought that--

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:41.115
    - [Hayley] You thought
    that what, Andy?

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:43.217
    - That you're this
    insanely beautiful,

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:45.319
    successful businesswoman
    and I'm a loser.

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:50.057
Okay, tell me you didn't fall
in love with my Am Ex card.

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:54.895
    Tell me that you fell
    in love with the schmuck

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:56.497
    who cries like a
    infant at the opera

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:58.265
and accidentally eats flowers.

01:18:58.267 --> 01:19:00.401
Tell me you don't care that
I'm a flat broke greeter

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:02.503
    who lives in a 200
    square foot apartment.

01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:08.175
    I know you would never
    lie, and I would never

01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:09.410
    stoop this low,
    but I didn't think

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:11.112
that you would fall for me if I,

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:16.350
    if I wasn't as
    successful as you were.

01:19:20.456 --> 01:19:21.489
    And that was wrong.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.292
But I am in love with you.

01:19:31.868 --> 01:19:33.334
    - I don't know you.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.871
    - Hayley, come on.

01:19:36.873 --> 01:19:39.340
        (solemn music)

01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:07.134
            (crying)

01:20:15.378 --> 01:20:17.244
    - Dress to impress.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:19.213
        Bollocks!

01:20:20.349 --> 01:20:22.416
        (sobbing)

01:20:25.388 --> 01:20:26.887
- It's gonna be a great day.

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:28.589
        A great day.

01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:43.103
        (light music)

01:20:58.621 --> 01:21:02.623
    ¶ Thinking tomorrow that
    I'll see your face ¶

01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:06.360
¶ So sorry that I let you go ¶

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:11.432
¶ And the memory of your kiss
still haunts me at night ¶

01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:15.069
¶ But I'm not with you babe ¶

01:21:15.071 --> 01:21:18.372
    ¶ Lost is what I feel ¶

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:22.142
    ¶ When you take
    me to your house ¶

01:21:22.144 --> 01:21:23.377
        (water running)

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:27.147
¶ And words cannot describe as ¶

01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:31.252
¶ I kiss your lips goodbye ¶

01:21:31.254 --> 01:21:33.387
    ¶ Lost is what I feel ¶

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.122
        (alarm buzzing)

01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:39.126
    ¶ When you take
    me to your house ¶

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:43.397
¶ And words cannot describe as ¶

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:47.434
¶ I kiss your lips goodnight ¶

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:51.405
    ¶ When I kiss your
    lips goodbye ¶

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:53.641
        ¶ Goodbye ¶

01:21:53.643 --> 01:21:55.943
        ¶ Oh, oh ¶

01:22:22.538 --> 01:22:24.705
        (knocking)

01:22:31.013 --> 01:22:33.180
        (laughing)

01:22:33.182 --> 01:22:34.014
    - Hey, what's going on?

01:22:34.016 --> 01:22:35.215
        - Who are you?

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:36.450
        (laughing)

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:38.018
    - I'm the guy whose
    door you knocked on.

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:39.954
        - I'm Andy.

01:22:39.956 --> 01:22:45.392
    I'm looking for
    Hayley, she lives here.

01:22:45.394 --> 01:22:46.994
    - Yeah, I guess
    you could say that.

01:22:46.996 --> 01:22:50.197
But she went out with Sasha,
she's not here right now.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.467
        (laughing)

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:55.469
- I'm sorry, I recognize you.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:59.740
    You're that guy from the
    pictures in her room.

01:22:59.742 --> 01:23:01.608
        - I'm Devon.

01:23:02.511 --> 01:23:05.145
    Oh, I know exactly,
    all right, cool.

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:06.513
    I know who you are.

01:23:06.515 --> 01:23:09.416
She's gonna be back in a
little bit, you wanna come in?

01:23:09.418 --> 01:23:10.250
            - Yeah.

01:23:10.252 --> 01:23:11.151
            Yeah.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:12.486
        - Come on in.

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:13.554
            - Okay.

01:23:15.257 --> 01:23:17.024
            (sighs)

01:23:17.026 --> 01:23:19.259
    - So, it's poker night.

01:23:19.261 --> 01:23:22.062
Make yourself
comfortable, have a seat.

01:23:22.064 --> 01:23:24.631
    - Oh, I don't wanna...

01:23:26.569 --> 01:23:30.304
    - This is Doc, Dopito,
    Bashful, and Grumpy.

01:23:30.306 --> 01:23:32.139
- Why do I gotta be Dopito?

01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:33.507
    - Because you look
    like a Mexican.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.442
- That's a little racist.

01:23:35.444 --> 01:23:38.545
- This is Hayley's friend.

01:23:38.547 --> 01:23:39.546
            - Andy.
            - Andy.

01:23:39.548 --> 01:23:40.647
    - Nice shirt, man.

01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:42.049
        Who's Hayley?

01:23:42.051 --> 01:23:43.617
    - Freeloader who lives
    in Sasha's closet.

01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:45.586
- Let's be nice, all right.

01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:47.788
Helping out a friend, thank you.

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:49.523
            - Sure.

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:51.125
Why did he just say that?

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:53.127
- He's a little banged
up, who knows what he says

01:23:53.129 --> 01:23:55.262
    half the time, don't
    worry about it.

01:23:55.264 --> 01:23:56.730
        - All right.

01:23:56.732 --> 01:23:58.098
            Can we?

01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:59.333
    - Can we smoke in here?

01:23:59.335 --> 01:24:00.551
            - No.

01:24:00.552 --> 01:24:01.768
    I told you that like
    a couple minutes ago.

01:24:01.771 --> 01:24:03.104
    You want Sasha to freak?

01:24:03.105 --> 01:24:04.438
    - Well how am I
    supposed to play poker

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.606
and drink without smoking?

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:07.541
- My apartment, my rules.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:10.177
        (laughing)

01:24:10.179 --> 01:24:11.445
- Hey, what do you mean--

01:24:11.447 --> 01:24:13.180
    - So with Hayley,
    I think that maybe

01:24:13.182 --> 01:24:14.581
    if you just give her
    a little bit of time--

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:16.650
- Honestly, I mean, it sucks.

01:24:16.652 --> 01:24:18.552
Next time we're not
gonna play at your place.

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:20.254
    This is like a nunnery.

01:24:20.256 --> 01:24:22.656
        (laughing)

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:25.192
    - Feels like you keep
    saying your place.

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:27.194
    - [Dopito] It's a place
    where nuns are made.

01:24:27.196 --> 01:24:28.629
    - Don't worry about it.

01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:31.398
First of all, it's also where
his ex-wife buys his weed,

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.599
    so there we go, right?

01:24:32.601 --> 01:24:34.768
        (laughing)

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:38.105
    - I'm gonna throw up.

01:24:38.107 --> 01:24:40.074
- Oh, dude, dude, dude,
right through the hallway,

01:24:40.076 --> 01:24:41.775
    first door on the right.

01:24:43.646 --> 01:24:44.711
    - See, it wasn't so bad.

01:24:44.713 --> 01:24:46.080
    - I mean, the drinks
    were really good.

01:24:46.082 --> 01:24:47.448
        - Hey babe.

01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:49.583
    - [Devon] Hey honey,
    we have a guest.

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:51.418
- So, what exactly did you mean

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:55.255
    when you said that
    this is your house?

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:56.190
            - Andy?

01:24:56.192 --> 01:24:57.091
            (scoffs)

01:24:59.161 --> 01:24:59.910
        - [Andy] Hi.

01:24:59.911 --> 01:25:00.660
What do you mean you live here?

01:25:02.398 --> 01:25:06.100
    - Okay, this is when
    you spit it out.

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:13.674
    - It's theirs, okay?

01:25:13.676 --> 01:25:17.644
    I haven't been entirely
    honest with you either.

01:25:18.681 --> 01:25:20.647
        (solemn music)

01:25:20.649 --> 01:25:24.418
    - Why would you tell
    me this was your place?

01:25:26.522 --> 01:25:29.690
- It means I don't exactly
have my own place right now.

01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:32.693
            - And?

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:37.698
            (sighs)

01:25:38.667 --> 01:25:40.734
- And I'm not a consultant.

01:25:42.404 --> 01:25:43.637
    I'm a shampoo girl.

01:25:46.509 --> 01:25:51.211
    And a failure, and now
    a fraud, apparently.

01:25:51.213 --> 01:25:52.579
        So that's good.

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:57.584
        (vomiting)
        (shouting)

01:25:57.586 --> 01:25:58.452
- [Sasha] Poker game over.

01:25:58.454 --> 01:25:59.686
            - Yes.
            - Yeah.

01:25:59.688 --> 01:26:01.488
- [Hayley] I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:02.890
- [Sasha] No worries, no
worries, you'll clean it up.

01:26:02.892 --> 01:26:04.341
    - [Andy] I'm sorry.

01:26:04.342 --> 01:26:05.791
    - [Devon] I think it
    might be time to leave.

01:26:05.794 --> 01:26:07.761
- [Andy] Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:12.633
    We were just lying
    to each other.

01:26:12.635 --> 01:26:13.834
        You know what?

01:26:13.836 --> 01:26:16.670
        (solemn music)

01:26:18.307 --> 01:26:20.174
    I wanted to love you.

01:26:22.311 --> 01:26:23.243
    I still wanna love you.

01:26:23.245 --> 01:26:26.747
Maybe one day we can, but

01:26:29.718 --> 01:26:34.354
not until we find the courage
to love ourselves as we are.

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:38.959
    Just not someone else.

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:46.333
    This is embarrassing.

01:26:47.903 --> 01:26:49.503
        I'm gonna go.

01:26:49.505 --> 01:26:50.404
            - Okay.

01:27:01.984 --> 01:27:04.918
    - Look, it's not the
    end of the world, right?

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.321
        - Oh. (laughs)

01:27:07.323 --> 01:27:08.555
    Probably gonna get
    fired from my job

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:09.957
    and I just lost a
    girl that I thought

01:27:09.959 --> 01:27:11.625
    I was gonna spend the
    rest of my life with,

01:27:14.496 --> 01:27:15.679
but it doesn't feel like it.

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.863
- Well, my point is, she's
never gonna see you again.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.234
    - Wait, that's my point.

01:27:20.236 --> 01:27:21.468
    - No, I'm agreeing
    with your point,

01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:22.903
    I'm just saying, she's
    not gonna see you again

01:27:22.905 --> 01:27:24.504
    because you lied to her.

01:27:25.874 --> 01:27:27.341
            - So?

01:27:28.611 --> 01:27:29.876
    - So you don't need
    to be embarrassed

01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:31.545
    that you threw up at
    her friend's house,

01:27:31.547 --> 01:27:32.846
    that's not the reason
    it didn't work out.

01:27:32.848 --> 01:27:34.748
- You are just a huge help.

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.450
- Look, do you ever wanna
see this chick again?

01:27:36.452 --> 01:27:37.818
    You don't even know her.

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:44.758
    - I just really
    thought I loved her.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.261
- You thought you loved her
or you loved the idea of her?

01:27:47.263 --> 01:27:49.263
    - I don't know, whatever
    it is, I miss it.

01:27:52.368 --> 01:27:55.035
Just wish I would have
never read that damn book.

01:27:55.037 --> 01:27:56.303
        - What book?

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.806
- Sasha, I think there
was something real there.

01:28:02.278 --> 01:28:05.646
    Under the lies and
    all that deception

01:28:05.648 --> 01:28:09.950
and everything we both
did, I think it was real.

01:28:12.888 --> 01:28:15.589
    Oh god, I must be crazy.

01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:16.623
        - Yes, you are.

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:18.425
        (laughing)

01:28:18.427 --> 01:28:22.663
    But so was he, and maybe
    you both being crazy

01:28:22.665 --> 01:28:24.698
    is why you're perfect
    for each other.

01:28:25.668 --> 01:28:26.900
    - If we were perfect
    for each other

01:28:26.902 --> 01:28:27.868
we wouldn't have lied, though.

01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:31.571
    - Well, I wouldn't be
    too hard on yourself.

01:28:31.573 --> 01:28:34.975
You were just (clears throat)
following instructions.

01:28:38.347 --> 01:28:39.313
        - Jessica.

01:28:39.315 --> 01:28:40.580
            - Yes.

01:28:40.582 --> 01:28:42.783
    - You know, I think
    my copy was broken.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:46.019
    - Is there security?

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:47.054
        - No no, no.

01:28:47.056 --> 01:28:48.855
        Don't worry.

01:28:48.857 --> 01:28:49.823
Don't worry, I'm leaving.

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:52.926
But thank you for nothing.

01:28:52.928 --> 01:28:54.695
        - I'm so sorry.

01:28:54.697 --> 01:28:55.896
That may have been my fault.

01:28:55.898 --> 01:28:57.864
    You don't know me,
    I'm Hayley, hi.

01:28:57.866 --> 01:29:00.834
I met you at a book
signing a few months ago,

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:05.572
    and yeah, I'm pretty
    sure that was me.

01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:06.707
            Sorry.

01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:07.774
    - Do you know him?

01:29:07.776 --> 01:29:08.909
            - I do.

01:29:08.911 --> 01:29:10.610
        He's my ex.

01:29:10.612 --> 01:29:12.746
- Oh, well your ex didn't
like my book very much,

01:29:12.748 --> 01:29:14.114
    he burned it, dumped
    it on my desk,

01:29:14.116 --> 01:29:15.682
and told me it was broken.

01:29:16.919 --> 01:29:18.018
        - Your book.

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:18.919
        - [Jessica] Was.

01:29:20.489 --> 01:29:21.755
        - I see that.

01:29:21.757 --> 01:29:22.789
        Sorry again.

01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:28.061
We've both been reading your
book and following your advice.

01:29:28.063 --> 01:29:29.663
        We did do that.

01:29:29.665 --> 01:29:32.099
Where we sort of
projected to be successful

01:29:32.101 --> 01:29:34.735
like we're wanting to be,
but we're not really, and--

01:29:34.737 --> 01:29:37.637
- Yes, you read it wrong.

01:29:37.639 --> 01:29:38.872
            - What?

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:41.875
    - It's project success
    in business not in love.

01:29:42.978 --> 01:29:45.779
        (light music)

01:29:45.781 --> 01:29:47.614
    - Is there any way you
    wanna go get a drink?

01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:50.917
I'd love to just talk to you
and maybe get some advice.

01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:52.819
    - You know what, I
    could use a drink.

01:29:52.821 --> 01:29:53.653
        - Really?

01:29:53.655 --> 01:29:54.821
            - Yes.

01:29:54.823 --> 01:29:55.922
            - Well.

01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:57.022
    - Yes, and the
    first one's on me.

01:29:57.025 --> 01:29:58.091
- Thank you, 'cause I'm broke.

01:30:18.447 --> 01:30:19.846
    - I don't care that
    you spent $20,000

01:30:19.848 --> 01:30:20.881
    of the company's money.

01:30:22.851 --> 01:30:23.784
I don't care that you committed

01:30:23.786 --> 01:30:25.419
what amounts to corporate fraud.

01:30:28.557 --> 01:30:30.123
    What I do care about
    is that I gave you

01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:32.058
    an opportunity and
    you squandered it.

01:30:33.429 --> 01:30:35.529
What I do care about is
that I saw potential in you

01:30:35.531 --> 01:30:37.063
that was never really there.

01:30:37.065 --> 01:30:40.100
What I care about is that
I wasted 15 years on you.

01:30:44.006 --> 01:30:46.973
    Now you have to find a
    way to help yourself.

01:30:46.975 --> 01:30:49.443
    Help yourself grow, I
    can no longer help you.

01:30:53.982 --> 01:30:54.815
        You're fired.

01:30:56.518 --> 01:30:57.217
    See yourself out.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:01.154
    - Sir, I understand.

01:31:02.558 --> 01:31:04.057
    I would fire me too.

01:31:04.059 --> 01:31:07.494
        (solemn music)

01:31:07.496 --> 01:31:11.498
But I am incredibly grateful for

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.099
    everything that
    you've done for me.

01:31:14.903 --> 01:31:19.973
And, well, there's nothing
I can say to let you know

01:31:22.778 --> 01:31:26.913
how sorry I am that I've let
you down, and let myself down.

01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:30.083
    - I got work to do.

01:31:31.854 --> 01:31:33.086
        (dialing phone)

01:31:33.088 --> 01:31:34.688
    - I'm coming back.

01:31:36.258 --> 01:31:38.225
    But I'm not coming
    back as your clerk.

01:31:40.496 --> 01:31:42.162
    I'm gonna come back
    as your partner.

01:31:46.568 --> 01:31:47.934
    And I'm gonna show you.

01:31:54.576 --> 01:31:57.143
        (hangs up phone)

01:32:07.122 --> 01:32:09.623
Grandma, you are a life saver.

01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:16.129
        (light music)

01:32:17.799 --> 01:32:18.698
            - Hi.

01:32:21.103 --> 01:32:23.003
    I'm Hayley, nice
    to meet you both.

01:32:31.113 --> 01:32:36.182
Okay, so my idea is to
combine a spa and a salon.

01:32:37.586 --> 01:32:41.154
    ¶ Conversation, said
    I'm lost in a mood ¶

01:32:41.156 --> 01:32:46.126
¶ I didn't drink, I
think I'm wasted on you ¶

01:32:46.128 --> 01:32:50.630
¶ I'll never last, never
feel like I can run, hey ¶

01:32:50.632 --> 01:32:55.302
    ¶ We light the fire then
    we pull out the plug ¶

01:32:55.304 --> 01:32:57.671
¶ There's no incandescent ¶

01:32:57.673 --> 01:33:02.642
¶ Inside the tattoo's
permanent, here to stay ¶

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.746
¶ There's no incandescent ¶

01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:11.818
¶ Inside the tattoo as we
feel, I'm here to stay ¶

01:33:12.721 --> 01:33:14.754
¶ Even if I meet you tomorrow ¶

01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:17.257
    ¶ I'll be here to wake
    you up in the morning ¶

01:33:17.259 --> 01:33:19.326
    ¶ And dance with you
    until nightfall ¶

01:33:19.328 --> 01:33:22.128
    ¶ It's today and the day
    and the day after that ¶

01:33:22.130 --> 01:33:24.130
¶ I'll stay with you tomorrow ¶

01:33:24.132 --> 01:33:26.800
¶ Good night into good morning ¶

01:33:26.802 --> 01:33:28.969
    ¶ We pick up our love
    as we trust fall ¶

01:33:28.971 --> 01:33:31.237
    ¶ It's today and the day
    and the day after that ¶

01:33:31.239 --> 01:33:33.139
    ¶ I'll stay with you ¶

01:33:33.141 --> 01:33:37.644
¶ The king of hearts is
being dealt on my sleeve ¶

01:33:37.646 --> 01:33:42.382
    ¶ It is no card with
    the hand of its queen ¶

01:33:42.384 --> 01:33:47.654
¶ If you're afraid to jump
then how will you ever fall ¶

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:51.758
    ¶ There's no shame in
    loving this deeply ¶

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.727
¶ There's no incandescent ¶

01:33:53.729 --> 01:33:56.630
¶ Inside the tattoo as we feel ¶

01:33:56.632 --> 01:33:59.666
    ¶ I'm here to stay ¶

01:33:59.668 --> 01:34:01.968
¶ Even if I meet you tomorrow ¶

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:04.304
    ¶ I'll be here to wake
    you up in the morning ¶

01:34:04.306 --> 01:34:07.173
    ¶ And dance with you
    until nightfall ¶

01:34:07.175 --> 01:34:09.175
    ¶ It's today and the day
    and the day after that ¶

01:34:09.177 --> 01:34:11.311
¶ I'll stay with you tomorrow ¶

01:34:11.313 --> 01:34:14.381
- Man, I've been working on
that thing for eight months.

01:34:14.383 --> 01:34:16.916
    - Listen, Crash Pad
    is a great idea.

01:34:17.919 --> 01:34:18.818
            - Yeah.

01:34:20.155 --> 01:34:22.422
Now that's out of my hands
all I can think about is her.

01:34:24.693 --> 01:34:25.392
            - Well.

01:34:26.962 --> 01:34:29.663
It's been inspiring watching
you work on something so hard.

01:34:30.966 --> 01:34:34.000
And listen, good things
happen to good people, right?

01:34:34.002 --> 01:34:35.301
    You keep your heart
    in the right place

01:34:35.303 --> 01:34:36.236
you're gonna get everything.

01:34:36.238 --> 01:34:38.271
You get the girl and the job.

01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:40.140
        You deserve it.

01:34:43.311 --> 01:34:44.344
    - [Andy] Thanks man.

01:34:47.215 --> 01:34:50.250
    (insects chirping)

01:34:59.061 --> 01:35:01.261
            (bangs)

01:35:01.263 --> 01:35:03.763
        (knocking)

01:35:08.036 --> 01:35:09.703
- What are you doing here, Andy?

01:35:11.239 --> 01:35:12.972
    - I would love to
    see Mr. Warren.

01:35:14.776 --> 01:35:15.475
        - Come in.

01:35:23.418 --> 01:35:27.954
Make yourself comfortable,
and I'll go grab him.

01:35:29.725 --> 01:35:32.258
Listen, don't tell him
that I'm telling you this,

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:36.262
but he really wanted you to
come visit for Christmas,

01:35:36.264 --> 01:35:37.430
        we both did.

01:35:38.433 --> 01:35:39.365
            (sighs)

01:35:39.367 --> 01:35:40.433
            - Yeah.

01:35:41.303 --> 01:35:42.469
    I'm sorry I missed it.

01:35:44.272 --> 01:35:45.905
    - Go ahead, go sit down.

01:35:50.746 --> 01:35:52.979
        (exhales)

01:35:55.851 --> 01:35:58.118
        (exhaling)

01:36:08.363 --> 01:36:09.429
        - What's that?

01:36:10.298 --> 01:36:11.531
    - How are you, sir?

01:36:24.346 --> 01:36:25.245
            That.

01:36:26.982 --> 01:36:28.114
    - Spit it out, Andy.

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:28.982
        - Yes sir.

01:36:28.984 --> 01:36:30.216
    It's your 50th hotel.

01:36:32.354 --> 01:36:33.353
    And it's my first.

01:36:34.389 --> 01:36:35.472
            Of many.

01:36:35.473 --> 01:36:36.556
        - I have no time
        for games, Andy.

01:36:36.558 --> 01:36:37.323
        - I understand.

01:36:38.326 --> 01:36:39.926
I'm not here to play games.

01:36:45.167 --> 01:36:46.065
        - Sit down.

01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:03.349
    - Mr. Warren, I
    need to apologize.

01:37:03.351 --> 01:37:04.984
    - I know that
    you're sorry, Andy,

01:37:04.986 --> 01:37:06.553
you don't need to apologize.

01:37:06.555 --> 01:37:07.420
            - Dude.

01:37:11.526 --> 01:37:16.596
I mean, you've been incredibly
gracious to my family and I.

01:37:22.337 --> 01:37:24.070
        You've been like
        a second father.

01:37:29.311 --> 01:37:34.380
    You deserve more respect
    and more gratitude

01:37:35.250 --> 01:37:37.317
        than I obviously
        can give to you.

01:37:39.487 --> 01:37:41.221
        Now I'm just--

01:37:41.223 --> 01:37:43.156
    - I appreciate that,
    Andy, thank you.

01:37:46.061 --> 01:37:49.095
Now shut the hell up and
show me what's in this case.

01:37:49.097 --> 01:37:51.164
            (laughs)

01:37:51.166 --> 01:37:52.465
- I'd like to present to you

01:37:56.404 --> 01:37:58.204
    Crash Pad Incorporated,

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:03.610
by Andrew Palazzo. (laughs)

01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:07.881
    And look, I mean,
    the projected revenue

01:38:07.883 --> 01:38:10.149
    from the first quarter
    is there, and you know,

01:38:10.151 --> 01:38:12.252
    if you flip here,
    actually, sorry.

01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:15.955
        But wait.

01:38:17.659 --> 01:38:19.459
        There's more.

01:38:19.461 --> 01:38:23.997
I'd like you to take a
stroll through the hotel.

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:33.640
I've created an idea to
make a hotel feel like home.

01:38:36.611 --> 01:38:38.544
    Like an apartment.

01:38:38.546 --> 01:38:42.515
    The interior, it's
    casual, it's friendly,

01:38:42.517 --> 01:38:46.219
    it's affordable, I
    mean, we have a staff

01:38:46.221 --> 01:38:47.553
that dresses in street clothes

01:38:47.555 --> 01:38:50.456
rather than bell hop uniforms,

01:38:50.458 --> 01:38:53.459
    and the refrigerators
    are filled with beer

01:38:53.461 --> 01:38:55.995
and hot pockets, if they want,

01:38:55.997 --> 01:39:00.433
    and I want a home
    away from home.

01:39:02.404 --> 01:39:03.636
    That's the Crash Pad.

01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.606
    I put my heart into
    this, Mr. Warren,

01:39:06.608 --> 01:39:09.175
and I feel like it can work.

01:39:10.145 --> 01:39:12.145
        And I mean, I--

01:39:12.147 --> 01:39:13.046
        - Scotch?

01:39:15.483 --> 01:39:17.083
        - No, I'm...

01:39:23.258 --> 01:39:24.490
        I'm off booze.

01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:29.595
            Yeah.

01:39:39.741 --> 01:39:41.240
    A home away from home.

01:39:47.215 --> 01:39:48.247
    - It's very very risky.

01:39:48.249 --> 01:39:49.382
    - No, Mr. Warren, I--

01:39:49.384 --> 01:39:50.249
            - Stop.

01:39:53.521 --> 01:39:54.587
    It's also brilliant.

01:39:56.458 --> 01:39:57.523
            (laughs)

01:39:57.525 --> 01:39:59.392
The hotel VCs are tight asses.

01:39:59.394 --> 01:40:01.294
They don't like to stray too
far off the comfort zone,

01:40:01.296 --> 01:40:04.197
so if this is gonna happen,
it has to be outside the box.

01:40:04.199 --> 01:40:05.598
    Investors with balls.

01:40:12.007 --> 01:40:12.672
        - Mr. Warren--

01:40:12.674 --> 01:40:13.606
        - Sebastian.

01:40:14.776 --> 01:40:16.242
        Sebastian.

01:40:16.244 --> 01:40:17.377
    If we're gonna be
    business partners,

01:40:18.346 --> 01:40:19.579
    it's gotta be on a
    first name basis.

01:40:19.581 --> 01:40:20.646
            - Sir.

01:40:22.650 --> 01:40:23.716
        Thank you.

01:40:25.086 --> 01:40:27.553
            (laughs)

01:40:27.555 --> 01:40:28.721
        - Here we are.

01:40:29.624 --> 01:40:31.391
    To the first step.

01:40:31.393 --> 01:40:32.225
        (glasses clink)

01:40:32.227 --> 01:40:33.059
    - To the first step.

01:40:33.061 --> 01:40:35.294
        (giggles)

01:40:36.498 --> 01:40:38.364
    Remind me again what
    the next step is?

01:40:38.366 --> 01:40:40.266
        (laughing)

01:40:40.268 --> 01:40:42.235
    - We find a company
    to partner with.

01:40:42.237 --> 01:40:43.569
        - Mm-hmm.

01:40:43.571 --> 01:40:45.738
- Someone who will be the
perfect fit for the spa.

01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:48.741
    Well aren't you happy?

01:40:49.677 --> 01:40:50.676
        - Oh, I am.

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:54.347
        I just miss him.

01:40:54.349 --> 01:40:56.082
        - So call him.

01:40:56.084 --> 01:40:57.150
        - No, I can't.

01:40:58.286 --> 01:41:00.486
I have to drag myself out first.

01:41:01.623 --> 01:41:03.389
If it's meant to be we'll
find each other again,

01:41:03.391 --> 01:41:05.425
    but this takes priority.

01:41:07.695 --> 01:41:09.695
        - Good girl.

01:41:09.697 --> 01:41:13.232
        (glasses clink)

01:41:13.234 --> 01:41:14.300
        - Nice suit.

01:41:15.603 --> 01:41:16.502
            Shiny.

01:41:17.605 --> 01:41:19.338
        - Thank you.

01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:20.673
    - Dude, you fart?

01:41:24.212 --> 01:41:26.379
        - That was me.

01:41:26.381 --> 01:41:27.747
        I'm sorry.

01:41:27.749 --> 01:41:29.282
        Not on purpose.

01:41:31.219 --> 01:41:36.289
        (light music)
        (birds chirping)

01:41:38.626 --> 01:41:40.760
            (typing)

01:42:02.684 --> 01:42:05.451
        (phone ringing)

01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:10.790
        - Hey babe.

01:42:10.792 --> 01:42:11.724
            Nothing.

01:42:11.726 --> 01:42:13.759
I'm stocking conditioner.

01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:16.863
    Yes, it's riveting.

01:42:20.135 --> 01:42:20.833
            What?

01:42:20.835 --> 01:42:23.436
        (screaming)

01:42:26.608 --> 01:42:27.773
        We did it!

01:42:27.775 --> 01:42:29.742
They said yes, they said yes!

01:42:29.744 --> 01:42:31.444
        They said yes!

01:42:31.446 --> 01:42:32.545
        They said yes!

01:42:32.547 --> 01:42:34.147
    - What is going on
    with the screaming?

01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.847
    What is happening?

01:42:34.849 --> 01:42:36.449
        - They said yes!

01:42:36.451 --> 01:42:37.350
        - I don't care.

01:42:37.352 --> 01:42:38.651
    Who said yes to what?

01:42:38.653 --> 01:42:41.220
    Your behavior is
    completely unacceptable.

01:42:41.222 --> 01:42:42.355
    - You know what Mia?

01:42:42.357 --> 01:42:45.391
    Blow it out of your ass.

01:42:45.393 --> 01:42:46.692
    Shove it in your face.

01:42:46.694 --> 01:42:48.227
    I'm out, bitches!

01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:49.462
        They said yes!

01:42:50.698 --> 01:42:53.399
        (light music)

01:42:54.836 --> 01:42:58.271
    (power tools whirring)

01:43:05.346 --> 01:43:06.679
So construction starts when?

01:43:06.681 --> 01:43:08.414
    - A few months from now.

01:43:08.416 --> 01:43:09.782
    Tonight is just a
    groundbreaking party,

01:43:09.784 --> 01:43:12.318
you know, a chance for
everyone to meet each other.

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.686
- [Hayley] I cannot believe
that this is happening.

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:15.388
        - Well, I can.

01:43:16.658 --> 01:43:17.823
    Because you deserve it.

01:43:18.626 --> 01:43:20.359
        (chuckling)

01:43:20.361 --> 01:43:21.794
        - Thank you.

01:43:21.796 --> 01:43:23.629
        - My pleasure.

01:43:23.631 --> 01:43:24.830
    - [Hayley] I can't see.

01:43:24.832 --> 01:43:26.432
    - I know, good good
    good, right here.

01:43:26.434 --> 01:43:27.366
            And

01:43:28.603 --> 01:43:29.502
        right here.

01:43:32.273 --> 01:43:33.773
    - It's beautiful.

01:43:34.809 --> 01:43:36.242
    - [Sasha] That's
    because it's yours.

01:43:37.345 --> 01:43:38.244
        - Thank you.

01:43:40.281 --> 01:43:40.913
            (sighs)

01:43:40.915 --> 01:43:41.948
            Sasha.

01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:43.749
            - Hmm?

01:43:43.751 --> 01:43:45.618
- What's this hotel called?

01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:47.753
    - What is this hotel
    called, you know,

01:43:47.755 --> 01:43:51.924
that is a really good question.

01:43:51.926 --> 01:43:53.726
    - [Andy] You know, I
    thought I said that.

01:43:53.728 --> 01:43:55.394
- You know what, you did.

01:43:56.464 --> 01:43:58.431
    I'm gonna go find
    some more liquid food.

01:43:58.967 --> 01:44:00.366
        - Thanks Sasha.

01:44:00.368 --> 01:44:02.501
- [Sasha] You're welcome.

01:44:05.406 --> 01:44:07.273
    - What, you don't
    remember the name?

01:44:09.444 --> 01:44:10.543
    - [Hayley] Crash Pad?

01:44:11.846 --> 01:44:12.912
            - Yeah.

01:44:13.781 --> 01:44:16.282
- [Hayley] How did you do this?

01:44:16.284 --> 01:44:17.383
    - With a lot of help.

01:44:18.253 --> 01:44:20.453
Some good advice, and some bad.

01:44:22.290 --> 01:44:23.422
        And Mr. Warren.

01:44:23.424 --> 01:44:24.757
    - We like Mr. Warren.

01:44:24.759 --> 01:44:25.791
    - We like Mr. Warren.

01:44:25.793 --> 01:44:27.760
        (laughing)

01:44:27.762 --> 01:44:30.997
When I found out we were gonna
have the space for a spa,

01:44:30.999 --> 01:44:33.799
I knew a little someone that
had some wonderful ideas,

01:44:33.801 --> 01:44:36.602
    just hadn't got the
    opportunities yet.

01:44:42.644 --> 01:44:43.542
        It was true.

01:44:47.649 --> 01:44:49.015
            Us.

01:44:49.017 --> 01:44:53.819
When you said that everything
we ever had together

01:44:53.821 --> 01:44:56.055
    was a lie, that wasn't
    true either, because

01:44:58.426 --> 01:45:01.927
    the moment you came
    through those doors,

01:45:04.499 --> 01:45:05.765
    I fell in love with you.

01:45:06.834 --> 01:45:08.834
        (light music)

01:45:08.836 --> 01:45:10.903
    And I know I did some--

01:45:10.905 --> 01:45:12.838
    - Shut up and kiss me.

01:45:23.418 --> 01:45:24.884
    Show me Crash Pad.

01:45:24.886 --> 01:45:25.985
         - [Andy] Okay.
        (Hayley laughs)

01:45:25.987 --> 01:45:27.520
¶ Simple but it's complicated ¶

01:45:27.522 --> 01:45:29.488
¶ Conversation underrated ¶

01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:33.659
¶ I could be your open
book when you're closed ¶

01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:35.594
¶ Tell me is it too impulsive ¶

01:45:35.596 --> 01:45:37.730

    stay till morning ¶

01:45:37.732 --> 01:45:41.867

    ¶ We'll stay up talking
    shit all night ¶

the world be set on fire ¶

for things we shouldn't find ¶

        ¶ Tonight ¶

01:45:57.885 --> 01:46:01.053
    ¶ 'Cause lately ¶

01:46:01.055 --> 01:46:05.458
    ¶ I been going crazy ¶

01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:09.462
    ¶ I think this
    might've saved me ¶

01:46:09.464 --> 01:46:13.599
¶ Exactly what I needed ¶

01:46:13.601 --> 01:46:18.671
    ¶ I need it tonight ¶

01:46:18.906 --> 01:46:21.741
            ¶ Yeah ¶

01:46:21.743 --> 01:46:26.812
    ¶ I need it tonight ¶

01:46:27.048 --> 01:46:29.949
            ¶ Yeah ¶

01:46:29.951 --> 01:46:32.485
    ¶ Spend a little
    time that's wasted ¶

01:46:32.487 --> 01:46:34.653
    ¶ We can jump into the
    pool we can get naked ¶

01:46:34.655 --> 01:46:38.691
¶ You wanna take it too
far, that's where we'll go ¶

01:46:38.693 --> 01:46:40.926
    ¶ Let's roll on out ¶

01:46:40.928 --> 01:46:42.928
    ¶ We'll stay up talking

01:46:42.930 --> 01:46:47.099
¶ And climb the roof and watch
