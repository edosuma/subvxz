Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:03.900 --> 00:07.100
This could go away. There's confusion
as to where in the car the drugs were.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.200
- Understood.
- They may vow to the coke as found property and let you go.

00:10.200 --> 00:13.600
I got a bad feeling on that place,
and I don't think you should be involved.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.700
My whole life, Bobby, I never turned a buck.
I got a chance at that now.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.000
You want to be a wiseguy, then be
a wiseguy. Don't be half a wiseguy.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.900
- I tried to help you before.
- Nah, you didn't try.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.000
- I warned you.
- You didn't warn me, Bobby!

00:24.000 --> 00:26.800
I did everything except give the exact time
that bust was going down.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.100
Opening.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.500
- Thanks.
- Bobby Simone.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.400
How's it going, Ray?

00:54.300 --> 00:57.900
How do you think? I'm in
the system here, Bobby.

00:57.900 --> 01:01.100
Yeah, they brought you down
for your appeal hearing, huh?

01:01.100 --> 01:03.400
My appeal.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.400
- Hey, you never know, right?
- That's right.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.300
'Cause you heard
about the trial, right?

01:07.300 --> 01:09.800
That little genius from Legal Aid
gets me three to five.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.300
I'm just the lookout.
Meanwhile, the principals...

01:12.300 --> 01:14.700
they mention a few names,
they're on the street already.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.000
I'm just talking
about justice here, Bobby.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
And I asked you to help me out at the time.
You turned your back.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.600
Is this why you asked me to come down here,
so that we can go over all of this again?

01:26.700 --> 01:29.100
I'm sorry. L...

01:29.100 --> 01:31.600
I just...

01:31.600 --> 01:33.500
I don't think
so good, you know?

01:33.500 --> 01:36.000
I'm upset all the time, Bobby.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.300
- I need your help, Bobby.
- There's no way I can help you, Ray.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.800
Don't worry.

01:44.700 --> 01:48.100
I'm bringing something
to the table- information.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.800
This guy I've been hanging
with in the yard...

01:51.700 --> 01:54.700
he worked this job some three years ago-
an armored car heist.

01:54.700 --> 01:58.400
A couple ex-cops were driving.
They both got killed.

01:58.300 --> 02:01.100
- You talking about the Grandpa Car?
- I heard him mention that.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.300
That's what they called it.
Now, according to him, they got away clean.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.600
Him and three other guys.
Is this ringing any bells?

02:07.500 --> 02:11.000
The Grandpa Car's a real case, Ray.
You got any names?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.700
I got a first and last on one of the guys
and a street name on one of the others.

02:14.700 --> 02:17.200
Do you think that's worth
something to the D. A?

02:17.200 --> 02:19.700
I'll see what I can find out.

02:19.600 --> 02:23.300
You know, I don't blame you
for what's happened to me, Bobby...

02:23.200 --> 02:27.400
but I got to get out of here.

02:27.400 --> 02:31.200
I gotta go, Ray.
That's from my job.

02:31.100 --> 02:34.200
Now, you tell the D.A.
I got those names.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.500
- I will. On the gate.
- Opening.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.100
- I'll let you know.
- Yeah, sure.

02:39.100 --> 02:41.700
Go ahead.
Walk out of here.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.400
- Hey.
- Hey, what's going on?

04:10.500 --> 04:12.100
Yeah, two people shot.
One D.O.A.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.900
Perp fled on foot. Got a couple
of witnesses over there.

04:14.900 --> 04:17.800
- Yeah, what's their story?
- Some guy showed up, started shooting.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.300
Guy shot in the shoulder's
just a flesh wound.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.700
- Wanna talk to him before they take him?
- Yeah, what's his name?

04:22.700 --> 04:25.000
- Samuel Velasquez.
- Samwell"?

04:25.900 --> 04:28.500
Samuel?
I'm Detective Sipowicz.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.800
This is Detective Simone. What can you
tell us about the guy that shot you?

04:31.800 --> 04:34.900
Oh, it was crazy, man.
Th-This black dude...

04:34.800 --> 04:38.200
he comes into the store, right,
and he starts screaming all this racial trash.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.600
- Then all of a sudden, I'm shot.
- You were the first one shot?

04:40.600 --> 04:42.500
No. He shot Luis first,
and then he started...

04:42.500 --> 04:44.400
waving the gun around,
shooting everybody.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.600
- He shot you first, man.
- Man, it was crazy.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.000
- It was all happening at the same time.
- All you guys were in there?

04:48.900 --> 04:51.500
Yeah, man. He was drunk. That's how come
he didn't just killed everybody.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.600
- He was a big guy.
- No, he wasn't that big.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.200
He was medium. He was black.
Real, real, real black.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.300
- He was about 50, man.
- You never seen this guy before?

04:58.400 --> 05:01.100
Yeah, I've seen him like maybe
coming out of the subway or something.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.300
- So maybe he lives around here?
- Yeah, maybe.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.300
We're not going to find out
this is about dope, right?

05:05.300 --> 05:08.900
You think 'cause we're boricua that means
we deal dope? What's wrong with you, man?

05:08.700 --> 05:10.600
- What's wrong with you? I got shot over here.
- All right.

05:10.700 --> 05:13.900
Take it easy, huh?
James, what do you got?

05:13.800 --> 05:16.600
We gave the place a quick toss.
We didn't come up with anything.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.500
- These guys are half loaded.
- Yeah.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.200
- You want us to start the canvass?
- Yeah. Keep your eyes open.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.200
Happens that the mariachi troupe
over here is telling the truth...

05:24.100 --> 05:26.200
we got a nut out there
with a gun.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.300
- You guys, we're gonna have to go over to the station house.
- James, take my car.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.100
- Sure.
- But this better not take all day, you know what I'm saying?

05:32.100 --> 05:34.600
Hey, your friend Luis
here just got shot.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.700
You gonna tell me about
Luis, man? I know the guy, man.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.800
- We don't feel up to this, man, okay?
- You're in mourning.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.800
All right.
I understand.

05:42.700 --> 05:45.200
- Get in here.
- Ayayay.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.100
Hey, man.
I can't believe this.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.100
Just keep looking.

05:59.100 --> 06:03.100
Excuse me. L- I was told downstairs
this is where to make my complaint.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.100
Oh. Um, uh...

06:05.000 --> 06:07.100
Detective Medavoy can see you.
Detective, you're up.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.300
- Oh. Can I help you?
- Yes. I'm the victim of an assault.

06:10.300 --> 06:15.400
Well, right this way. Let's get
some information about what happened.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.200
My name's, uh-
My name's Peter Cahill.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.200
- Have a seat, Mr. Cahill.
- Thank you.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.400
Uh, how badly were you
hurt in this incident?

06:23.400 --> 06:26.100
Uh, bruises
up and down my arms...

06:26.100 --> 06:28.600
and, uh, feel this bump.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.600
It's quite large.

06:30.600 --> 06:35.300
It looks painful. Were you struck
with a foreign object?

06:35.200 --> 06:37.100
With a blunt-edged sword.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.900
D- Do you know
the person who hit you?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.500
The stage actor, Raleigh Gibson.
You probably know him.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.000
Uh, no, I don't get to
the theater too much.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.900
Well, in the middle
of the sword fight last night...

06:46.900 --> 06:50.400
he completely abandoned
the choreography and attacked me.

06:50.300 --> 06:53.100
I take it
you're an actor as well.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.100
Yeah. Last week,
he nearly put my eye out.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.700
Did you speak to anyone
at the theater about this?

06:58.700 --> 07:01.900
They don't want to deal with it.
They tell themselves he's box office.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.000
They should tell the empty seats.
Meanwhile, I take a nightly beating.

07:07.200 --> 07:11.100
Procedure, Mr. Cahill- I look into
your complaint, talk to the relevant parties...

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
and then there will be
a decision on charges.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.300
I work at
the Ludlow Theater.

07:15.200 --> 07:19.500
Ask Roland Edmunds about him.
Ask Donna Stein.

07:19.300 --> 07:22.800
Definitely. I'll check
the matter out.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.700
Well, uh, thank you
for coming in.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.800
Well, I was- I was
on my way to the doctor.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.800
- May I help you?
- Yes, I'd like to speak to the detective in charge.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.000
Arthur Fancy. I'm lieutenant
in charge of the squad.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.400
- Louis Folsom. I'm pastor at Bethel A.M.E.
- How do you do?

07:45.300 --> 07:48.200
Why don't you come in?
Have a seat.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.500
Lieutenant...

07:55.500 --> 07:58.100
one of my parishioners was involved
in a shooting this morning.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.700
He says he shot two men.

07:59.800 --> 08:03.200
There was a multiple shooting
at a bodega on Third Street.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.800
- Sounds like the incident.
- So what's the man's name?

08:06.800 --> 08:10.600
He says when he fired the gun,
he was in fear for his life.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.500
Well, if he was in danger,
that's a very important factor.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.200
So, where can
we find him?

08:15.100 --> 08:19.200
I'd like to be able to tell him I spoke
with the man that he would be talking to.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.700
You can tell him that.
So how can we find him, Pastor?

08:27.800 --> 08:29.800
His name is Gregory Leight.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.700
He's not far from here.
I'll go get him.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.200
Okay.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.900
Your bodega
witnesses set up?

08:49.900 --> 08:52.100
They want to know do they get paid
if they pick out the shooter.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.900
It's part of dealing
with their grief.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.700
A suspect's coming in with his minister.
We'll get his statement...

08:57.700 --> 08:59.600
have the witnesses take a look.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.400
Hey, Lieu. We turned up a neighbor on the canvass.
She saw a kid running down the street...

09:02.300 --> 09:04.300
screaming just before
the shots were fired.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.200
Didn't know the kid,
but she saw him come out.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.200
Somebody's gonna have to keep
these guys in the mug books.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.900
- Lieu says the shooter's
coming. - Is that right? - Yeah.

09:11.900 --> 09:15.300
As soon as you look at the guy, James,
get some fillers from the shelters for a lineup.

09:15.300 --> 09:18.800
And, Adrianne, run a Gregory Leight
through B.C.I. I'm not sure of the spelling.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.300
- Okay.
- Did the minister say how it happened?

09:21.300 --> 09:24.300
- No, but he said the guy'd give a full statement.
- Can't hate a ground ball.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.600
Okay, I'll be there in the interview.
He asked for that.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.600
Yeah, all right.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.200
Lieu. Uh, that guy
Ray DiSalvo...

09:31.200 --> 09:33.800
The guy I grew up with, took a collar
last year for moving coke.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.300
Yeah, worked at
that rumba joint.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.800
He's on the inside now.
Claims a guy on his tier copped to...

09:38.800 --> 09:41.300
sticking up the Grandpa Car
with three other skells.

09:41.300 --> 09:44.100
- Did he give any names?
- He says he's got a full name on one of the guys...

09:44.100 --> 09:46.800
- and another guy's nickname.
- That was Roberts's case.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.500
- The Grandpa Car?
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.800
- Well, see if the D.A. Wants to deal.
- I'll call Sylvia.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.700
Lieu...

09:59.100 --> 10:00.800
This is Gregory Leight.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.400
Uh, he's got the gun.

10:06.300 --> 10:09.400
I'm Arthur Fancy. I'll take your statement
with Detective Sipowicz.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.800
I'm trying to reach A.D.A. Costas.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.700
- Okay.
- I'll tell your wife that I saw you go in with the lieutenant.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.700
This way.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.400
Have a seat, Mr. Leight.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.800
- Miles, put this in evidence lockup.
- Okay, Lieu.

10:37.300 --> 10:42.800
So, uh, your pastor said you wanted
to talk to us about a shooting.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.700
Those drunks down at
the bodega went after my son.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.700
Tell us what happened.

10:47.700 --> 10:50.500
Well, I sent him out for bread,
and after about 10 minutes...

10:50.500 --> 10:52.400
I hear
all this yelling.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.900
His friend comes to my door,
crying and carrying on...

10:55.900 --> 10:57.900
and saying that
Junior's in trouble.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.000
- So what was his friend's name?
- Delroy.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.300
My wife would know
his last name.

11:02.300 --> 11:05.500
But he was yelling that they were
beating Gregory down at the bodega.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.900
He said, Mr. Leight,
they're beating Junior!"

11:07.900 --> 11:11.000
So I grabbed an old gun
I keep in the house.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.700
And I went out in the street,
and here comes my son running...

11:13.600 --> 11:16.000
his face all
covered with blood.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.200
- So how old is your son?
- Ten. Ten years old.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.300
There's drunks
in that place.

11:23.300 --> 11:27.800
I told him he's never supposed to
go near that filthy place!

11:27.600 --> 11:31.400
Just to save a half a block to the grocery.
Now look at all this trouble.

11:31.300 --> 11:34.600
So when you saw your son,
was he alone in the street?

11:34.500 --> 11:36.400
Was anyone chasing him?

11:36.400 --> 11:40.200
No, there was just somebody looking out from
the bodega, but nobody was chasing him.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.400
- And you went on to the bodega?
- I sent him home.

11:43.400 --> 11:47.200
- Then I went in.
- Did you have your gun out?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.500
Not then. I said...

11:50.400 --> 11:54.000
Hey. Who beat my boy?"

11:54.000 --> 11:57.100
And there was a lot of yelling,
screaming back and forth.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
And some racial stuff. And one of them
said to the other some Spanish.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.900
And the guy behind the counter,
he grabbed beneath.

12:04.900 --> 12:08.500
And then the guy in the aisle
started coming at me.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.300
And that's when
I pulled out my gun.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.400
'Cause the guy behind
the counter was going for a gun...

12:14.300 --> 12:16.900
and the guy in the aisle
was coming at me.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.900
I was so upset
about my boy.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.800
And you shot 'em both.

12:31.300 --> 12:34.300
I have been a longshoreman
for 25 years.

12:34.300 --> 12:37.500
I've never even had
a parking ticket.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.700
What do you want to do?

12:43.600 --> 12:46.600
Talk to the son and the friend
who came and got him.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.800
Even if they back the father's story,
he's looking at manslaughter.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.600
- That's where I want you to start, Andy.
- No problem.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.800
Want me to run the witnesses
through B.C. I?

12:54.700 --> 12:57.900
- They don't look like no choir boys.
- Yeah.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.400
Whoever's in with him,
I'll, uh...

13:00.400 --> 13:02.900
I'll make sure they don't
let him write nothing.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.100
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.000
Hey, no problem.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.800
How'd the hearing go?

13:28.800 --> 13:31.900
It was a joke, Bobby. Judge didn't
give us five minutes.

13:31.900 --> 13:35.400
Ray, this is Assistant D.A.
Sylvia Costas.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.200
- Ray DiSalvo.
- How do you do?

13:37.300 --> 13:40.400
Miss Costas wants to talk to you
about this armored car job.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.400
No problem.
I'm all for women's lib.

13:42.300 --> 13:46.600
You got the D.A. Sent me away
beat a mile.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.200
Jewish guy,
big pot belly.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.400
Maury Abrams.
I've been looking over your file.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.300
I meant no disrespect.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.400
He was doing his job.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.600
Mr. DiSalvo, if the information
that you've offered...

13:58.600 --> 14:00.300
on the Grandpa Car
produced arrests...

14:00.300 --> 14:03.200
we'd support reducing
your sentence by half.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.500
Support?
Uh-uh.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.300
I'm not giving up names
on support.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.300
She's gotta put it
that way, Ray.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.400
What happens if you guys blow the arrest?
That's not my fault if you guys screw this up.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.200
- We won't screw it up.
- How do I know that, Bobby?

14:20.300 --> 14:23.800
- Reduced by half?
- With the time served, that's only four more months.

14:23.800 --> 14:28.200
- Yeah, but I didn't do nothing. I was just the lookout.
- Ray, Ray, Ray.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.800
Do you want to
go through with this?

14:30.900 --> 14:34.500
- Do I have a choice?
- Come on.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.500
Sorry.

14:42.300 --> 14:47.100
The guy I'm in with,
his name is Jimmy Fredo.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.800
The guys he said
he did thejob with...

14:50.700 --> 14:52.900
one is Tommy Rotella-
is the full name I got.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.800
And the second guy's
nickname is called Bic.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.800
- First or last name on the nickname?
- I don't know.

14:58.800 --> 15:03.100
All right, this Jimmy Fredo's the guy
that you're in jail with right now.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.900
He gave you Tom Rotella and another guy
whose nickname is Bic.

15:05.900 --> 15:08.200
- Right.
- You said there were three guys on the outside.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.700
That's all I got.
They got away clean.

15:11.700 --> 15:15.100
They're living good. Jimmy's doing time.
I don't know the score.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.600
All right, Mr. DiSalvo.

15:21.900 --> 15:24.300
All right, Ray,
we're gonna look into this.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.400
What, you're going to send me
back upstate now? I gotta go back there?

15:27.400 --> 15:30.100
They'll keep you down here
till we see if this all works out.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
You'll be in
administrative segregation.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.300
But it's still jail, right?

15:47.300 --> 15:49.300
Gregory.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.200
Gregory.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.100
The police are here.
They have to ask you some questions.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.700
I'm Detective Sipowicz,
Gregory.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.000
How did you
get those bruises?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.400
- Those guys hit me.
- Tell me the guys you mean.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.700
- In the bodega.
- How come they did that?

16:06.600 --> 16:10.200
- I don't know.
- He knows he wasn't supposed to be down there.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.200
He was supposed to
go to the Korean place.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.600
Him and his friend didn't
want to walk the extra block.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.700
You need to let us ask the questions,
Mrs. Leight.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.000
We're trying to find out
what happened with your dad.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.800
So we really need you
to think about this.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.900
I don't know. They said
it was the change.

16:26.900 --> 16:29.800
- The change?
- It was for a loaf of bread.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.900
I had the exact change,
so I put it on the counter.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.500
- He didn't like it there.
- Who didn't?

16:35.400 --> 16:40.000
The guy behind the counter. He pushed it
back at me, said put it in his hand.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.600
Then 20 of the cents
went on the floor.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.900
Then the other guy come up
behind me and told me to pick it up.

16:44.900 --> 16:48.500
And I said, 'The counter guy pushed it
on the floor. He should pick it up."

16:48.500 --> 16:50.800
Then they started
beating on me...

16:50.800 --> 16:53.600
him and a couple
other guys.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.800
Delroy was looking in.
Then he ran.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.600
After a couple of minutes,
I finally got out.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.200
And then when did
you see your dad?

17:02.200 --> 17:06.599
Delroy run and got him.
He was coming down the street.

17:06.500 --> 17:12.300
When he saw me, he started crying.
He said, Get home."

17:12.099 --> 17:14.200
Then I guess he
went in the bodega.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.300
Do you need anything else?

17:18.300 --> 17:20.400
Where can we
find Delroy Freeman?

17:20.400 --> 17:24.000
- I can get you his mother's number.
- Delroy in trouble too?

17:23.900 --> 17:28.300
You're not in trouble, Gregory.
Your daddy's in trouble.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.700
Yo, did Rico pick out
the right guy?

17:42.700 --> 17:44.600
Don't worry about
what Rico did, Tonio.

17:44.600 --> 17:48.500
The shade's gonna be lifted to see six people.
You can see in, but they can't see out.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.400
If you recognize any one person, let me know
who you recognize and where from.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.200
Yeah, yeah, all right.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.100
Yo, that's the guy
right there. Number Four.

17:57.100 --> 17:59.000
- That's him right there.
- Where do you know him from?

17:59.100 --> 18:01.700
He shot Luis, man.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.000
- All but Four can go.
- Screw you, pendejo.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
- Shut up.
- You takin' the juice for Luis, man.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.200
- Go grab some coffee, all right?
- Yo, can I go home now, man?

18:09.100 --> 18:11.200
Go grab some coffee.
I'll ask my lieutenant.

18:14.200 --> 18:18.000
Poor guy, huh?
Sends his kid out for some bread?

18:18.000 --> 18:21.600
- What kind of toss you give that bodega?
- We were moving pretty fast.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.100
All right.
Keep the witnesses here.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.800
- Get Andy, and toss it again.
- Okay.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.700
Hey, uh, Lieu.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.400
Listen, that
sword-fighting complaint...

18:39.400 --> 18:41.400
I talked to the stage manager
from the theater...

18:41.500 --> 18:44.300
and he said absolutely this famous
actor guy was out of line.

18:44.300 --> 18:47.200
- Okay.
- Yeah, he says this Gibson's like...

18:47.100 --> 18:49.900
you know, one of those
larger-than-life kind of guys.

18:49.900 --> 18:53.100
- You know, he gives everybody a hard time.
- Okay. Bring him in.

18:53.100 --> 18:56.600
Yeah, at the same time, some of
the other actors said that, you know...

18:56.600 --> 19:01.400
you always get bruised up
doing stunts and such in a performance.

19:01.300 --> 19:05.100
Also, according to them, the complainant
was rather stiff in that scene...

19:05.000 --> 19:09.200
which angered the other guy,
who's high-strung with very high standards.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.600
Look, what do you want to do
with the complaint, Greg?

19:11.600 --> 19:15.100
- I figured I'd, uh, bring the other guy in.
- Good. Do that.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.900
You okay, boss?

19:24.900 --> 19:28.800
A decent guy shaping to get
screwed in this bodega homicide.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.200
- Gentlemen.
- How's it going, Roberts?

19:31.100 --> 19:34.900
Okay, Medavoy. You still lobbing
scuds at the P.A. A?

19:36.200 --> 19:39.400
- I'll keep you posted, Lieu.
- Yeah.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.500
We might have something
on the Grandpa Car.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.500
Yeah. Bobby Simone
asked me to come in.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.000
- He said you had some action on that.
- There he is.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.300
- He'll run it for you.
- How's your family, Lieu?

19:50.300 --> 19:53.600
Good. You know
how yours is doing?

19:53.600 --> 19:56.700
Yeah.
They're good.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.900
- Mike Roberts, Bobby.
- Hey, Mike, thanks for coming in.

20:04.900 --> 20:07.500
Sure. You're looking at
the Grandpa Car again, huh?

20:07.500 --> 20:11.200
Yeah, yeah. You know, I got a C.I.
That gave up some names.

20:11.100 --> 20:14.400
- Tryin' to see if they're live.
- Yeah, I hated not clearing that.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.400
They whack two ex-cops.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.900
Mike, you did an interview
on that case with a Brendan Bickles.

20:18.900 --> 20:22.100
Yeah, he worked for the security company.
Didn't go anyplace.

20:22.100 --> 20:24.200
Yeah, well, see,
my guy says he was in it.

20:24.100 --> 20:27.600
Well, shame on me then.
I think I talked to him...

20:27.600 --> 20:29.800
- in the Garfield over on 23rd.
- Right.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.700
D.M.V. Still shows him over there.
We're going to pick him up.

20:32.700 --> 20:35.000
Anything I can push him with
that didn't get into your five?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.700
You know,
did he gamble? Use?

20:36.700 --> 20:40.700
I only talked to him off working for
the company. I had no reason to like the guy.

20:40.600 --> 20:44.900
My C.I. Also gave up a Jimmy Fredo,
Tom Rotella. That do anything for you?

20:44.800 --> 20:48.600
- Nothing. Neither one.
- Well, thanks for coming in.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.800
I remember talking
to this Bic.

20:50.700 --> 20:52.700
You know,
the Garfield Hotel.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.100
You know, many as you did,
it's crazy how you can remember.

20:55.100 --> 20:57.200
Yeah. I appreciate
your coming in, Ray.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.300
Hey, I hope you
collar up on this.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.600
Listen, opportunity
presents itself...

21:03.400 --> 21:07.200
you might ask does your lieutenant
plan on lightening up on me...

21:07.200 --> 21:10.100
before the new century.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.100
- Take care.
- All right, Mike.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.700
- Thanks.
- Okay.

21:30.700 --> 21:34.200
Clerk said he went to get some smokes.
He'll be back in a few minutes.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.500
Didn't I hear about this Roberts?
Had a junkie girlfriend.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.000
Yeah, she killed herself.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.900
I was driving
for the commissioner then...

21:40.800 --> 21:43.600
but, uh, they said they caught him
cleaning out her place.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.000
- Roberts was robbing her apartment?
- No, no. He was married.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.500
So he was trying to get rid of pictures.
Anything that could put him with her.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.800
That's Bic. Not much
to look at, huh?

21:53.700 --> 21:55.600
Yeah.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.200
Check this out over here.
That's the rat squad.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.500
- I.A.B.'s sitting on us?
- What is up with that?

22:04.500 --> 22:06.800
I'll be right back.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.100
You need me, Martens?

22:16.100 --> 22:17.900
Why, you got
a guilty conscience?

22:17.900 --> 22:20.400
- Answer the question.
- We're picking up a suspect.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.300
- It's got nothing to do with you.
- Uh-huh.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.800
There's the guy
across the street.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.400
- Hey, that's my guy.
- That's our guy. You back off.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.300
Take it easy.
Get your hands up.

22:39.300 --> 22:41.000
- I didn't do anything.
- Put your hands up.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.900
- You Brendan Bickles?
- I didn't do anything!

22:43.800 --> 22:46.400
- What are you worried about?
- He's our suspect, Simone.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.900
- This is our suspect. We're taking him to our house.
- I didn't do anything.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.000
- Shut up.
- He's our collar, Simone.

22:51.100 --> 22:54.000
- Now, don't talk to him till we straighten this out.
- Yeah, right.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.300
Even if he's begging
to confess.

23:08.400 --> 23:11.000
What the hell good are these cameras?
They don't tape anything.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.300
Do you think they were bluffing this black guy
about there being a gun back here?

23:14.200 --> 23:17.200
Guy sticks a gun in their face,
they're gonna pretend they got one too?

23:17.100 --> 23:20.100
- Yeah, that wouldn't make sense.
- That gun was there. They moved it.

23:20.100 --> 23:22.800
Cigarettes, aspirins,
condoms, batteries.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.000
Amazing variety of merchandise they fit
behind the counter of these little stores.

23:25.900 --> 23:30.000
Guys get tanked all day long.
Start at 8:00 in the morning.

23:29.900 --> 23:32.600
- I'm going to check the Dumpster.
- Yeah.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.400
- Martinez.
- What do you got?

23:34.400 --> 23:38.200
Here. Here,
you want a Popsicle?

23:38.200 --> 23:40.900
- They were in the freezer?
- Yeah. Don't you keep your guns there?

23:48.400 --> 23:50.700
We've been on this Bickles
for three months...

23:50.700 --> 23:53.100
and our information-
he's involved with a cop.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.100
Our information
is he's the cop killer.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.700
- One don't leave the other out.
- Let's stop playing footsie.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.800
Come on.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.900
My C.I.'s name is Ray DiSalvo.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.600
He's doing time right now
with a Jimmy Fredo, who claims...

24:07.600 --> 24:10.200
that he pulled the Grandpa shootings
with this Bic...

24:10.200 --> 24:13.700
and a Tom Rotella,
who's locked up right now in Ohio...

24:13.600 --> 24:17.100
- and another guy that Ray didn't have the name on.
- Which would make it your turn.

24:16.900 --> 24:20.400
I'm not authorized
to share my information.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.900
You know,
you guys are the best.

24:23.900 --> 24:26.700
Look, you don't want
to share information?

24:26.700 --> 24:29.300
This Bic isn't a cop.
So my guys will run the interview...

24:29.300 --> 24:31.400
until it's established
a cop's involved.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.200
Stay out of my way.

24:38.300 --> 24:40.600
- Close the door on those bodega guys.
- Okay.

24:44.100 --> 24:46.900
- Are you Delroy?
- I'm Louise Freeman. This is my son.

24:46.900 --> 24:50.300
- How you doing?
- Delroy's interested in the wanted flyers.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.700
- Policemen draw?
- Yeah, some of them.

24:52.700 --> 24:56.200
- This is Delroy Freeman and his mom. Detective Lesniak.
- How do you do?

24:56.200 --> 24:58.100
How you doing, Delroy?

24:58.100 --> 24:59.900
Why don't you
come on in here, Delroy.

24:59.900 --> 25:03.900
Take a seat
right there. Okay.

25:03.800 --> 25:08.000
So, Delroy, you know
why we brought you here?

25:07.800 --> 25:11.600
- Junior got into a fight.
- Can you remember how that started, Delroy?

25:11.600 --> 25:14.800
Junior had to buy a loaf of bread,
and we didn't go to the grocery.

25:14.700 --> 25:17.400
So Junior"
is Gregory LeightJr?

25:17.300 --> 25:20.300
- Yes.
- So then they throwed his change on the floor...

25:20.200 --> 25:23.700
and Junior didn't like it, then all of sudden
they went crazy, punching and kicking.

25:23.700 --> 25:26.000
- Did they punch and kick you?
- They wasn't mad at me.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.300
They mad atJunior.
Punching and punching.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.500
So I ran down the street
to tell his dad...

25:30.500 --> 25:33.600
- You gotta do something 'cause they're gonna kill him."
- Is that what you said?

25:33.500 --> 25:36.300
- You told Junior's dad they were killing him?
- Yeah.

25:36.300 --> 25:40.400
'Cause they was stomping him. So he went
down with his gun and shot 'em dead.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.400
But I didn't see
that part.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.400
You got to look
in this bag.

25:44.300 --> 25:49.200
Okay. Thanks for coming down.
I appreciate it.

25:49.100 --> 25:51.200
You take care, all right?

25:51.200 --> 25:53.700
I want you to tell me this all again
so I can write it down.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.300
Okay.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.800
Oh, man. Oh, man.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.700
- Is something wrong, Bic?
- No. No.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.200
You try to live your life,
you get dragged off the street...

26:03.200 --> 26:05.700
army of people stand
staring at you.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.300
- There's nothing wrong.
- You know why. You've been waiting for this day.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.100
- No, I don't. I don't know.
- Okay, Bic.

26:13.900 --> 26:16.400
This is connected with two guys
who did 20 years on this job...

26:16.400 --> 26:18.400
before they started
working security.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.700
Two ex-cops who were making
an armored car delivery...

26:21.600 --> 26:24.100
- with the firm that you happened to be working.
- This is crazy.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.100
- What's crazy?
- I had nothing to do with that robbery.

26:27.100 --> 26:29.500
- I was talked to at the time.
- Look around, Bic. You think...

26:29.500 --> 26:32.000
anyone here thinks it's crazy
liking you for those homicides?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.800
I can't help
what you people think!

26:33.800 --> 26:36.500
SoJimmy Fredo is Iying?

26:36.500 --> 26:40.300
- What?
- And Tom Rotella, he's Iying?

26:40.300 --> 26:43.600
'Cause they
gave you up, Bic.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.700
They say you shot those cops.
Both of them say it was you.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.300
No way.
Forget it. No way!

26:48.300 --> 26:50.200
Two ex-cops.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.500
You know how that means
we'll go at you, right?

26:52.500 --> 26:55.400
- Leave me alone!
- What, are they Iying? Fredo and Rotella...

26:55.400 --> 26:57.400
- they Iying?
- Anyone told you that is Iying.

26:57.300 --> 26:59.900
That's crazy
what they told you!

26:59.900 --> 27:03.700
I don't think so.
Two ex-cops.

27:03.600 --> 27:06.600
- And I think that you killed them.
- I killed no one.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.500
You're looking at
an injection here, Bic.

27:09.400 --> 27:13.600
What you say in this room right now,
what you say gets you a way out. Okay?

27:17.500 --> 27:19.400
I gave them
some information.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.800
Delivery times.

27:21.800 --> 27:25.400
I was nowhere near
that robbery, all right?

27:25.400 --> 27:28.700
Give up Ernie Kowalski.

27:28.600 --> 27:32.600
You give up the cop,
and you'll skate.

27:34.200 --> 27:40.100
You get me a lawyer, and you put that
in writing, and then we'll talk.

27:39.900 --> 27:42.000
That's it.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.500
He was gone. I had him.
You didn't have to give him squat.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.100
- You'd have got the two in jail.
- I would have had him for the package.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.400
If I had that cop's name,
I could've moved him for it all.

27:54.400 --> 28:00.000
- Who's the riding D. A?
- You give this guy a walk before you trust me to do my job?

27:59.900 --> 28:02.300
'Cause I'm not as good as you, Martens?
You only trust I.A.B.

28:02.200 --> 28:05.100
Hey!

28:05.100 --> 28:07.300
You trust any of us?

28:08.800 --> 28:11.700
Who's the riding D. A?

28:11.700 --> 28:13.600
Costas.

28:13.600 --> 28:17.300
I'll call her. I'll get this guy
someone from Legal Aid.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.700
I had him.

28:23.700 --> 28:27.500
How long am I going to have to be here?
Someone call my agent.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.200
Mr. Gibson, if you'll just cooperate,
things will go a lot easier.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.300
Strange men in little suits appear
at the door of your dressing room...

28:33.300 --> 28:37.300
and suddenly you're in some... dirty office,
no one knows why.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.300
It's Pinter.

28:40.300 --> 28:43.600
- God, is that Raleigh Gibson?
- I don't know.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.100
My God,
it is Raleigh Gibson.

28:49.100 --> 28:51.900
I gotta get my Brownie.

28:51.800 --> 28:56.300
Mr. Gibson, I'd like you to make a statement
regarding Mr. Cahill's complaint.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.300
Statement?

28:58.200 --> 29:01.400
The little turd got
just what was coming to him.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.100
- Where do I sign?
- Mr. Gibson...

29:03.100 --> 29:05.400
did you strike Mr. Cahill
with a broadsword?

29:05.300 --> 29:09.900
I was acting, Detective. Are you aware
of the distinction between theater and reality?

29:09.800 --> 29:14.000
So you're saying that you-
y- you didn't intend to harm him.

29:13.900 --> 29:16.600
I intended to kill him,
in the context of the scene.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.600
His intention should have been
to defend himself.

29:18.600 --> 29:23.600
But you have been hitting
Mr. Cahill with a sword. You admit that.

29:23.400 --> 29:26.500
I was trying to engage him,
to make him commit...

29:26.400 --> 29:29.600
instead of drifting about
the stage in a terrified haze.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.000
Truth to tell, I was doing
the bloody fool a favor.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.400
- By hitting him?
- Detective...

29:35.600 --> 29:39.200
Mr. Cahill shows some
mild promise as an actor.

29:39.100 --> 29:42.200
By bringing charges, which can
serve only to curtail his career...

29:42.200 --> 29:44.600
he demonstrates a staggering
lack of imagination.

29:44.500 --> 29:47.900
I intended to provoke him.
I meant him no harm.

29:47.900 --> 29:51.000
Now, with due respect...

29:51.000 --> 29:53.900
the very limited appeal this conversation
has for me is now exhausted.

29:53.900 --> 29:55.900
May I go?

29:57.200 --> 29:59.400
Uh, I don't know if
charges will be laid.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.500
I have to talk
with my boss.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.000
In the outcome, you obviously
know where to find me.

30:03.900 --> 30:07.400
Mr. Gibson- Uh,
I'm sorry for intruding.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.800
But I am such a fan.
Would you mind?

30:09.800 --> 30:12.300
Um, Miss Abandando...

30:12.300 --> 30:15.000
Sure.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.900
Right here.

30:16.900 --> 30:20.800
I may soon be posing
with little numbers across my chest.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.200
You guys hold me forever
just 'cause I'm on parole?

30:29.200 --> 30:31.100
That's my boss.

30:31.100 --> 30:34.000
We're going to talk about
this morning again, Rico.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.900
The guy came in shooting.
He killed Luis. Okay?

30:36.900 --> 30:39.200
- How many times do you need to hear it?
- Start with the assault.

30:39.200 --> 30:42.900
- He came looking to fight.
- Start when you beat his son. That assault.

30:42.800 --> 30:46.500
- Nobody beat his son.
- That man sent his boy out for a loaf of bread...

30:46.500 --> 30:48.400
and you and your friends
kicked him around.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.800
You're gonna get collared for that,
and then we're gonna violate your parole.

30:51.800 --> 30:55.200
- Man, I don't believe this.
- You owe, what, three years on your last bit?

30:55.100 --> 30:58.300
What, you think you can kick this kid around
without getting your parole violated?

30:58.300 --> 31:02.600
I wasn't even back there.
I was standing on the aisle.

31:02.500 --> 31:05.600
Okay. Okay, now we're
gonna deal with the guns.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.800
Gun? There wasn't
no guns, man.

31:12.900 --> 31:17.500
There were guns.
You stashed them in the freezer.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.700
We're sending these
to the lab, Rico.

31:19.800 --> 31:23.200
- They lift your prints, you're done.
- I wasn't even back there.

31:24.600 --> 31:27.400
I threw one afterwards.
That's how my prints got on.

31:27.300 --> 31:30.600
From throwing it in the freezer.
Luis yelled.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.500
Samuel went for the gun.
I'm only a witness.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.600
- Give it up then.
- What did Luis yell?

31:36.200 --> 31:40.300
To Samuel. He said, Kill him."
Matalo.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.600
He told him in Spanish.

31:47.700 --> 31:50.700
What you write now
is going to be as important for...

31:50.600 --> 31:55.500
how you live the rest of your life
as what happened this morning.

31:55.400 --> 31:59.100
You need to give a clear picture
of what you saw and did...

31:59.100 --> 32:01.500
and what you were feeling
as things took place.

32:01.500 --> 32:05.400
If you were afraid for your son,
and your own fear once you were inside...

32:05.300 --> 32:08.000
then that's something
you should talk about.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.700
I was afraid.
And I was angry.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.200
If your fear was
the most important thing...

32:17.200 --> 32:19.800
if it guided your actions...

32:19.800 --> 32:22.300
then that's definitely
something you should say.

32:22.200 --> 32:25.800
You don't want to clutter it up-
10 different feelings.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.900
To be afraid for your life...

32:27.900 --> 32:32.300
and what made you feel that way,
the specific events.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.000
- When he reached under the counter.
- The shouting.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.600
Hearing the other man
shout to him...

32:37.500 --> 32:39.500
then seeing the man
behind the counter...

32:39.400 --> 32:44.100
Uh-huh. I didn't see the gun,
but I knew he was going for it.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.800
You knew from what
the other guy shouted.

32:47.700 --> 32:50.400
The other man
shouted kill him"...

32:50.400 --> 32:52.700
so you knew the counterman
was reaching for a gun...

32:52.700 --> 32:55.000
that that's what
he had shouted in Spanish.

32:59.500 --> 33:05.200
For the district attorney to know that
you understood the expression...

33:05.000 --> 33:08.300
that you knew matalo"
meant kill him" in Spanish...

33:08.200 --> 33:11.300
and that put you in fear
for your life.

33:11.300 --> 33:15.000
That's big,
your understanding that.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.300
That's why I was afraid.

33:23.300 --> 33:25.400
He was reaching
for the gun...

33:25.500 --> 33:28.900
'cause the other fellow
shouted 'kill him."

33:28.800 --> 33:32.300
- In Spanish.
- Matalo.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.800
Matalo.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.200
Present in the room,
Detective Kowalski...

34:00.100 --> 34:04.700
assigned to Narcotics Division,
his counsel and a union delegate.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.200
Also present,
Sergeants Laski and Martens...

34:07.200 --> 34:09.100
with the Internal
Affairs Bureau.

34:09.100 --> 34:12.000
Detective, you acknowledge
being given your rights?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.199
Yes.

34:14.199 --> 34:17.800
Detective Kowalski,
do you know a Jimmy Fredo...

34:17.699 --> 34:20.100
a Tom Rotella
or a Brendan Bickles?

34:21.199 --> 34:23.199
I decline to answer that...

34:23.300 --> 34:25.300
as is my right
under the Fifth Amendment.

34:25.199 --> 34:29.000
Your name has come up in connection
with an armored car robbery...

34:28.900 --> 34:31.699
that took place
September 9, 1992.

34:31.699 --> 34:34.500
- What was your involvement in that incident?
- I decline to answer.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.900
And accomplish what? You decline an answer
if you know guys that we know you know?

34:37.900 --> 34:40.400
- What, you think I'm an asshole?
- That one I'll answer.

34:40.400 --> 34:44.000
No, you won't.

34:43.900 --> 34:46.199
You realize if you fail to answer,
under G.0.-15,you're suspended.

34:46.199 --> 34:48.600
I'll live.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.500
Detective Kowalski,
you're now suspended.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.800
I'll relieve you of
your shield and your weapon.

34:59.300 --> 35:02.200
- Can he go now?
- No.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.600
- I'm placing him under arrest.
- What?

35:05.500 --> 35:07.300
Stand up.

35:07.300 --> 35:09.600
Don't look at your
lawyer for help, Kowalski.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.300
You thought you were walking out
ofhere with just a suspension?

35:12.300 --> 35:15.500
Well, you're going tojail.
Now we'll see who the asshole is.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.300
Oh, Mr. Cahill.

35:30.700 --> 35:33.400
- Thanks for coming in again.
- Are you gonna charge him?

35:33.400 --> 35:36.600
Have a seat.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
My investigation, Mr. Cahill-
uh, there's a basis to file for assault...

35:44.000 --> 35:48.700
which I doubt would get far in court, but
he'd definitely be put in the system, Mr. Gibson.

35:48.600 --> 35:52.300
He'd be in jail briefly, with a need
to make bail, so forth.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.100
That's what I want.

35:54.200 --> 35:57.500
Mr. Cahill, I'm obviously
ignorant, but, um...

35:57.400 --> 36:01.200
couldn't filing charges like this be negative
on your career outlook?

36:01.200 --> 36:06.400
You know, rather than some form
of compromise, some try at discussion?

36:06.300 --> 36:08.500
There'd be no point.
He- He won't stop.

36:08.500 --> 36:12.000
He hates me. He- He has no
respect for my acting.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.100
- He said you had promise.
- Who did?

36:14.900 --> 36:17.800
Mr. Gibson.
His account was...

36:17.800 --> 36:20.000
you were promising
on stage, but in a haze...

36:20.000 --> 36:22.800
- which he was trying to prod you out of.
- Do you think he meant it?

36:22.700 --> 36:24.800
Or was he just trying
to avoid charges?

36:24.700 --> 36:27.900
No, I don't think he was
too worried about the charges.

36:27.900 --> 36:31.000
And I'd say he was sincere
about your promise...

36:31.000 --> 36:33.500
while seeming not to like you
too much personally.

36:33.400 --> 36:37.900
I thought he was just
trying to humiliate me...

36:37.700 --> 36:39.900
to show that I had
no business onstage.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.300
We can charge
third-degree assault, Mr. Cahill.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.200
Do you want
to go forward?

36:48.500 --> 36:51.600
No. No, I don't.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.200
All right.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.700
- I'm sorry I took up your time.
- Nah.

36:55.700 --> 36:59.800
Actually, I enjoyed it somewhat.
I had an experience in the theater.

36:59.700 --> 37:02.800
- Well, thank you very much.
- Anytime.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.100
- Banquo?
- Excuse me?

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
L- I saw you at the Public
in the Scottish play.

37:09.900 --> 37:14.000
- Thank you for the evening.
- You're welcome.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.400
He was really good.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.300
How much of this
is corroborated?

37:24.300 --> 37:26.300
The son's being beaten
was witnessed.

37:26.300 --> 37:30.900
Plus the friend confirms telling the father
he thought the kid was being killed.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.700
A witness in the bodega
corroborates...

37:32.700 --> 37:35.600
one of the victims shouted in Spanish
for the counterman to kill Leight.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.000
- Matalo. Which Leight understood.
- Yeah.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.500
- And you recovered the weapon the counterman reached for?
- Yeah.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.400
The grand jury's gonna
have to look at this...

37:43.400 --> 37:45.500
but I doubt that
we'll wanna indict this man.

37:45.400 --> 37:48.600
- He might get charged with the unregistered gun.
- Thanks, Sylvia.

37:52.700 --> 37:56.000
- I'll tell this guy her impression, huh?
- Yeah. All right.

38:10.300 --> 38:13.600
Try and follow this.

38:13.500 --> 38:17.300
By me not giving up that name,
that's supposed to make your life easier.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.400
You don't have
Kowalski's name...

38:19.300 --> 38:21.900
even if you and him went
through the academy together...

38:21.800 --> 38:24.800
your partner bowls with him,
you had pizza once on retreat...

38:24.800 --> 38:26.900
any pals you might be
where you'd want to protect him...

38:26.800 --> 38:28.900
you don't got to
make that mistake.

38:28.900 --> 38:31.700
You're looking out for me.
You're keeping me from temptation.

38:31.700 --> 38:34.800
Crack wise all you want. If you
would've queered that interview with Bic...

38:34.800 --> 38:36.800
and you
had Kowalski's name...

38:36.800 --> 38:38.600
- then I gotta come looking at you.
- Yeah.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.800
- Well, thanks for being in my corner.
- Look...

38:41.800 --> 38:45.600
no one's always a liar,
and no one's always corrupt.

38:45.500 --> 38:49.100
Everything is a situation.
You keep people out of situations...

38:49.100 --> 38:51.700
and you keep them
out of trouble.

38:54.200 --> 38:57.900
I just hope that my informant don't lose out
on his sentence reduction...

38:57.900 --> 39:00.800
because you people
took over the case.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.800
Why is that funny?

39:04.100 --> 39:06.200
Who do you think
our informant was?

39:06.200 --> 39:08.100
Your buddy, DiSalvo...

39:08.200 --> 39:11.900
he shopped us this package
three months ago with all the names.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.200
He came to you when he got
afraid we weren't moving.

39:14.200 --> 39:17.200
He left Kowalski out because
he knew you'd have to notify us.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.200
Yeah, okay.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.100
You might want to know...

39:23.400 --> 39:26.100
he shopped you to us too.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.500
Said you reached out to
an arresting cop on a coke collar.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.400
Got the cop to
let him walk.

39:32.300 --> 39:34.200
So where am I with that?

39:34.200 --> 39:37.100
You're all right.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
I looked into it.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.400
Everything's a situation.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.500
You worked that good.

40:00.500 --> 40:04.800
- Yeah, I felt like he deserved a break.
- Yeah.

40:04.700 --> 40:08.400
Not 'cause of who he was.
Straight up.

40:10.300 --> 40:14.600
You mean, that wasn't one of
those affirmative action investigations?

40:14.500 --> 40:16.800
- No.
- No.

40:16.800 --> 40:20.200
I didn't think so.
Good night.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.700
Good night.
You worked that good too.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.600
Bobby.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.500
They collared
those guys, Ray.

40:52.500 --> 40:56.200
- One of them confessed.
- Is that right?

40:56.100 --> 40:58.100
That's-
That's great.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.100
Yeah.

41:00.100 --> 41:03.600
And you know that third guy, the one
that you didn't have the name on?

41:03.500 --> 41:07.900
Turns out he was a cop.
He's behind the whole thing.

41:07.800 --> 41:11.900
Huh. Interesting.

41:11.700 --> 41:15.400
- Guy's name is Kowalski.
- Uh-huh.

41:15.400 --> 41:19.300
Of course you knew that
already, right, Ray?

41:19.200 --> 41:20.900
And you made me the jerk
holding it back.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.100
Whoa, now,
that was not my intention.

41:23.100 --> 41:28.000
Your intention was playing
all the angles for yourself.

41:27.900 --> 41:30.400
I spoke to police Internal Affairs
several months ago...

41:30.300 --> 41:32.500
but they disappeared
from the picture.

41:32.500 --> 41:35.300
I never heard from them.
That was a free ball what I gave you.

41:35.200 --> 41:38.700
Ray-They were sitting
on that cop, Ray.

41:38.700 --> 41:41.700
They moved the same time
that we did.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.800
- I had no knowledge of that.
- Neither did I. You didn't give it to me.

41:44.700 --> 41:47.900
Oh, come on, Bobby. I know how
cops feel about collaring their own.

41:47.900 --> 41:50.400
I wanted to spare you that.

41:52.500 --> 41:54.500
You would say
anything, Ray, huh?

41:55.800 --> 41:58.400
The moon is made
of green cheese."

41:58.400 --> 42:00.800
Hey, I don't like
the tone of this.

42:00.800 --> 42:03.500
Now, my information
produced arrests.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.800
I.A.B.'s collaring.
You should look to them to deliver.

42:05.800 --> 42:07.600
Just a minute.
Just a minute now!

42:07.500 --> 42:09.500
You people
better not welsh!

42:09.500 --> 42:13.600
Maybe you can sweeten the pot
with I.A.B. You can offer 'em me again.

42:13.400 --> 42:17.700
Offer them you? What are
you talking about, Bobby?

42:17.600 --> 42:20.100
Ray, let me
tell you something.

42:20.100 --> 42:24.100
I know who offered me
to them, all right?

42:24.100 --> 42:28.100
You stand there right now and lie to me,
I will break your jaw!

42:28.000 --> 42:32.100
Oh, my God. My God.
I'm going to be screwed. I know it.

42:32.100 --> 42:34.900
You're going to stick the knife in me,
aren't you, Bobby?

42:39.500 --> 42:43.800
No, Ray. You are
gonna get your deal.

42:45.100 --> 42:48.100
I am? Oh!

42:48.100 --> 42:51.000
- I am so grateful.
- Move your hands.

42:53.600 --> 42:57.300
Yeah, sure.
I understand.

42:57.300 --> 43:00.300
I just ask that you would understand
as well about me giving you up.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.900
I mean, I- I was
in a situation, Bobby.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.500
Hey, Ray, I...

43:20.500 --> 43:24.600
I don't want to see you
on the outside, Ray, all right?

43:24.600 --> 43:27.600
I don't care what
your situation is.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.300
On the gate.

43:32.700 --> 43:35.400
I'm sorry, Bobby. Y...
