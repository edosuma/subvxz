02:29.240 --> 02:31.183
Excuse me, Mr. Filby!

03:40.120 --> 03:41.267
I say...

03:44.800 --> 03:49.861
- I say, it's outright rude of him!
- He's merely been detained.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.301
This is such a waste of time!

03:52.360 --> 03:56.101
If he's not coming, I have
more important things to do.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.020
Well, speak up. What is it, woman?

04:12.560 --> 04:17.029
Well, are we or are we
not invited for dinner?

04:17.079 --> 04:18.386
Apparently we are.

04:19.640 --> 04:24.109
- How long has he been gone?
- I'm not certain, sir. Several days.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.581
I've hardly seen him for some time.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.230
He never leaves the lab. He only
comes in and picks at his food.

04:31.880 --> 04:36.429
But he did tell me about dinner,
and left those instructions.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.783
Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

04:42.280 --> 04:46.180
- What's it say, Filby? What's wrong?
- Nothing, really.

04:46.240 --> 04:51.221
George says that if he's not here
by 8, we're to begin without him.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.950
Oh!

04:53.000 --> 04:54.943
Walter, what time is it?

04:58.680 --> 05:00.987
Dinner is served, gentlemen.

05:01.040 --> 05:04.428
Ah, first sensible thing
I've heard all evening.

05:05.480 --> 05:09.790
This is peculiar. He's usually
prompt, precise and punctual.

05:09.840 --> 05:14.582
Oh! He's making fools of us by not
showing up. It's ungentlemanly.

05:14.640 --> 05:18.665
- To say nothing of a waste of time.
- Huh? Yes. A waste of time.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.950
Ah, one thing I like about
George, best cellar in England.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.627
And Mrs. Watchett is the
finest cook in the world.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.221
Yes, I think I'll drink to that.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.660
- Good Lord! What's happened?
- I'm all right.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.344
Some food.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.186
A drink.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.984
- I didn't recognize you.
- Mrs. Watchett.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.665
Can't you speak? What
happened to you?

06:19.760 --> 06:21.749
- Leave him alone.
- It's fine.

06:21.800 --> 06:27.111
- I've got to tell it while I remember.
- Relax. Try to relax.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.104
You've all the time in the world.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.230
You're right, David.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.870
That's exactly what I have.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.629
All the time in the world.

06:43.720 --> 06:46.471
Since we were together
five days ago...

06:46.520 --> 06:48.509
the last day of 1899.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.787
There in that box rests the
result of two years' labor.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.706
I wanted to finish the job
before the new century began.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.185
I barely made it.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.781
- Cheers, gentlemen.
- Marvelous, old boy.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.511
Mm, yes, but what is it?

07:15.440 --> 07:17.747
Well, it has to do with time.

07:18.360 --> 07:22.226
Oh. I've always maintained
that this nation...

07:22.280 --> 07:24.064
needs a reliable timepiece.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.302
Mm, the navy needs one. Heh.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.304
The army needs one
for the artillery.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.944
You couldn't do better, George.
That's why you've been in hiding?

07:34.400 --> 07:36.628
Very clever of you indeed.

07:36.920 --> 07:40.945
I don't think George is
referring to a new timepiece.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.590
No, David.

07:45.080 --> 07:49.390
When I speak of time, I'm referring
to the fourth dimension.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.104
Go on, George.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.628
The fourth dimension
cannot be seen or felt.

07:59.600 --> 08:05.150
If you don't mind, will you refresh
me on the first three dimensions?

08:05.200 --> 08:09.589
Oh, really, Filby. Surely they taught
you something in school. Heh-heh.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.629
Suppose you explain it, doctor.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.624
Huh? Oh, certainly.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.147
Heh.

08:17.200 --> 08:22.670
For example, when I move in a
line, forward or backward...

08:22.720 --> 08:24.106
that's one dimension.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.668
When I move left or
right, two dimensions.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.141
When I move up or down...

08:30.240 --> 08:31.944
three dimensions.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.308
For instance, that box.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.424
That box has three dimensions:
length, breadth and height.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.188
What is the fourth dimension?

08:44.240 --> 08:49.790
Oh, well... That's mere theory.
No one really knows if it exists.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.266
On the contrary.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.187
The fourth dimension is as real
and true as the other three.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.906
In fact, they couldn't
exist without it.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.107
What do you mean?

09:01.640 --> 09:03.185
Let's take that box.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.706
It has the first three dimensions.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.471
- What's inside?
- I'm coming to that.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.429
Let's consider this first.

09:11.480 --> 09:16.711
Why do we ignore the fourth dimension?
Because we can't move within it.

09:16.760 --> 09:21.866
We can move in the other three. Up,
down, forward, sideways, backward.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.785
But when it comes to
time, we are prisoners.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.547
Do you follow me, Bridey?

09:31.600 --> 09:32.781
No.

09:34.320 --> 09:40.541
George, you've given a lucid explanation,
but I'm afraid I don't understand.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.384
There are many things you
don't understand, yes?

09:44.520 --> 09:45.951
Quite a number.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.950
Yet you don't refuse
to believe in them?

09:49.040 --> 09:53.429
- Not if I can see the proof myself.
- Good, Walter.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.549
Gentlemen, all I'm asking you...

09:57.600 --> 10:00.829
is to witness a demonstration
of movement...

10:00.880 --> 10:03.187
within the fourth dimension.

10:09.440 --> 10:13.306
- Doctor, can I have your help?
- Certainly. Ahem.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.826
Ah, it's beautiful!

10:38.880 --> 10:41.381
- Remarkable.
- Very nice, George.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.424
Fascinating.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.911
What is it?

10:45.960 --> 10:48.586
This is only an experimental model.

10:51.040 --> 10:56.021
- To carry a man, I need a larger one.
- To carry a man? Where?

10:56.400 --> 10:58.628
Into the past or into the future.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.830
This is a time machine.

11:02.280 --> 11:07.022
Okay, George, you've had your joke.
Tell us what this contraption is for.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.387
I've already told you.

11:09.480 --> 11:13.141
The larger model can carry
a passenger through time.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.906
Not through space,
but through time.

11:15.960 --> 11:20.031
If you go to the future, won't
you mess things up for us?

11:20.440 --> 11:23.862
The future's already there.
It cannot be changed.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.871
I wonder.

11:29.720 --> 11:33.347
That's the most important
question I hope to answer.

11:34.360 --> 11:39.671
Can man control his destiny? Can he
change the shape of things to come?

11:40.080 --> 11:43.229
If you've gone mad, I forgive you.

11:43.280 --> 11:48.910
- But if you're wasting our time...
- No! You're here as witnesses.

11:48.960 --> 11:52.621
- To see, not to listen.
- To see? What?

11:52.680 --> 11:55.226
The experiment I'm
about to perform.

11:56.200 --> 12:01.784
Let me tell you how it works. The
time traveler sits in the saddle.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.669
In front are the controls.

12:04.520 --> 12:08.864
Let's do this properly. You
can spare a cigar, I trust?

12:09.680 --> 12:14.946
Now, let us imagine
that this cigar...

12:15.960 --> 12:17.471
is the time traveler.

12:18.640 --> 12:22.745
The lever in front of
him controls movement.

12:22.840 --> 12:26.149
Forward pressure sends
it into the future...

12:26.200 --> 12:28.951
backward pressure, into the past.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.865
The harder the pressure,
the faster it travels.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.549
Our little experiment can
be performed only once.

12:37.440 --> 12:42.831
If it succeeds, I lose my model.
That's why I need witnesses.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.265
Go ahead, George.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.786
Ready, gentlemen?

12:54.600 --> 12:57.670
Doctor, lend me your hand.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.548
I'll be damned!

13:49.640 --> 13:50.980
It worked.

13:52.280 --> 13:55.543
- Where did it go?
- Go?

13:55.640 --> 13:58.061
Nowhere, in the usual
sense. It's still here.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.221
But it's no longer in the present.

14:03.080 --> 14:07.344
It's traveling through time.
To the future, to be exact.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.901
You expect us to believe that?

14:09.960 --> 14:12.267
Well, you just... Certainly.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.583
- You said it hadn't really moved.
- That's correct.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.902
Then why can't we see it?

14:18.000 --> 14:21.309
Because we're in this room
on December 31, 1899...

14:21.360 --> 14:25.146
but the model is perhaps a
hundred years away by now.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.702
This house may not be
here in a hundred years.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.268
But the time machine occupies
the same space that it did...

14:32.320 --> 14:34.263
a moment before its journey.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.347
If it's occupying the same
space, why can't I feel it?

14:38.400 --> 14:42.391
The space you're putting your
hand through is today's space.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.982
You can't put your hand
into tomorrow's space.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.507
Space doesn't change!

14:48.560 --> 14:51.823
The same space that's here
now should be here forever.

14:51.920 --> 14:55.467
No, Philip, time changes space!

14:57.560 --> 15:03.463
This flat ground could've been at
the bottom of the sea long ago.

15:03.520 --> 15:08.228
A million years from now, it could
be the interior of a huge mountain.

15:08.280 --> 15:13.864
If all this is true, what do you
expect to do with such a contraption?

15:13.920 --> 15:15.829
Contraption?

15:16.960 --> 15:19.267
I intend taking a journey
into the future.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.108
Or perhaps the doctor
would volunteer to go?

15:23.160 --> 15:24.466
Mm? Hm.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.990
Look here, George...

15:27.040 --> 15:30.622
suppose you do go off and get
lost in the 50th century...

15:30.680 --> 15:34.785
- ...how will you get back?
- That's a risk I'm ready to take.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.747
Oh. Now, look here, George.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.983
I don't know what you
think, but we're not fools!

15:42.080 --> 15:44.069
We're practical businessmen.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.700
What I want to ask you is this:

15:46.760 --> 15:51.184
Even if you had invented a
time machine, what of it?

15:51.240 --> 15:55.231
What's its use? Who'd buy it?
How much would it cost?

15:55.280 --> 15:58.429
Have you thought of the
commercial possibilities?

16:00.360 --> 16:01.621
No, I haven't.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.064
George... There's a war
on in South Africa.

16:06.520 --> 16:12.423
The Boers are putting up a fight. The
country needs inventors like you.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.629
I can put you in touch
with the War Office.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.305
What do you think, David?

16:22.440 --> 16:23.985
Oh, I...

16:24.080 --> 16:27.423
Dr. Hillyer has a
good point, George.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.585
Ah. That's more sensible. Ha.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.027
I'll see to it right away.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.387
Good Lord! It's time to go.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.510
Yes, I'm sure we all
have plans for tonight.

16:40.720 --> 16:44.711
- Are you all right, George?
- Yes, I'm all right.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.305
Coming, Bridewell?

16:52.840 --> 16:53.987
Thanks for coming.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.786
- Good night.
- Happy New Year.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.989
- Happy new century, George.
- Good night.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.708
Happy New Year!

18:30.640 --> 18:31.821
George.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.785
I thought I'd better stay.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.064
You shouldn't trouble
yourself. I'm all right.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.986
No, you're not.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.750
You've been behaving oddly
for over a month.

18:59.880 --> 19:03.063
I'll leave, once you tell
me what's on your mind.

19:03.160 --> 19:07.504
I appreciate the gesture, David.
I just want to be left alone.

19:07.560 --> 19:10.425
You've changed, George. Enormously.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.186
I'm sorry.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.104
Will you answer me one
question, honestly?

19:23.800 --> 19:24.947
Yes, I'll try.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.424
Why this preoccupation with time?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.067
Why not?

19:33.080 --> 19:34.830
Don't go simple on me.

19:38.040 --> 19:41.986
The truth is, I don't much care
for the time I was born into.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.021
People aren't dying fast enough.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.350
They call upon science to invent...

19:47.440 --> 19:51.750
new, more efficient weapons
to depopulate the Earth.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.343
And I agree with you.

19:54.400 --> 19:58.585
I agree, but here we are and we
have to make the best of it.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.908
You may have to. I don't.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.781
All right. Take your journey
on your contraption.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.271
What would you become?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.222
A Greek? A Roman?

20:09.280 --> 20:12.111
- A pharaoh?
- I prefer the future.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.666
You're not seriously
saying you can do it?

20:18.160 --> 20:20.740
You saw the experiment, didn't you?

20:21.640 --> 20:24.425
I saw a toy machine vanish.

20:25.480 --> 20:28.186
I'm sure there are any number
of ways of doing that trick.

20:29.320 --> 20:32.629
Any magician could probably do it.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.945
It wasn't a trick!

20:37.600 --> 20:41.147
- Would you like to see the full-scale model?
- No, I would not.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.622
I have no desire to tempt
the laws of Providence.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.349
And I don't think you should.

20:48.720 --> 20:53.462
- It's not for man to trifle with.
- You carry on like Hillyer and Kemp.

20:53.560 --> 20:57.381
There's something to say about
their common-sense attitude.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.708
George, I speak to you as a friend.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.703
More. As a brother.

21:06.520 --> 21:10.466
If that machine can do what
you say it can, destroy it.

21:11.360 --> 21:14.270
Destroy it before it destroys you!

21:15.600 --> 21:19.864
You must have plans for New
Year's Eve. Don't let me keep you.

21:22.720 --> 21:27.109
Mary wasn't well. We thought
we'd stay home with the baby.

21:29.320 --> 21:34.108
Why not come home with me?
You haven't seen Jamey for a while.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.870
I'm sorry, I can't.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.669
What's stopping you?

21:44.680 --> 21:49.911
Well, I just want to see the old
century out by myself, that's all.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.944
Have it your way, George.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.791
George?

22:02.600 --> 22:05.943
Will you promise you'll not
go out of the house tonight?

22:10.520 --> 22:13.271
I promise I won't
walk out the door.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.346
David?

22:20.200 --> 22:24.305
I'm sorry. Please don't think
me unkind or unfriendly.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.663
- Come over to dinner Friday.
- Very well.

22:27.720 --> 22:31.666
- Fine. Bring the others with you.
- As you say, George.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.343
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, David.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.624
- Having supper in tonight, sir?
- I don't think so.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.423
Why don't you go and celebrate?

23:30.520 --> 23:35.831
Thanks, but if you don't need me,
I'll turn in earlier, if I can.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.789
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

23:39.360 --> 23:43.784
Oh, Mrs. Watchett, I invited Mr. Filby
and the others to dinner Friday.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.951
- Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.
- Happy New Year, sir.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.387
Happy New Year!

26:12.960 --> 26:16.587
<i>At first, I pushed the lever
forward very slightly...</i>

26:18.360 --> 26:21.270
<i>and the laboratory
grew faint around me.</i>

26:37.840 --> 26:38.987
<i>I stopped.</i>

26:44.000 --> 26:45.545
<i>No change.</i>

26:46.280 --> 26:48.747
<i>Everything exactly as before.</i>

26:49.680 --> 26:54.547
<i>No! The clock said 6:31 when I
started, and now it was...8:09?</i>

26:56.080 --> 26:58.945
<i>And the candle, shorter by inches.</i>

27:01.960 --> 27:06.941
<i>Yet by my watch, which was with me,
only a few seconds had passed.</i>

27:25.840 --> 27:31.185
<i>It was disconcerting to see the
sun arc in less than a minute.</i>

27:32.920 --> 27:35.705
<i>To see a snail race by.</i>

27:35.760 --> 27:39.342
<i>Flowers flinging wide their
petals to embrace the day.</i>

27:40.160 --> 27:43.343
<i>The hours speeding
across my sundial.</i>

27:43.960 --> 27:47.223
<i>Flowers closing their
eyes for the night.</i>

27:47.280 --> 27:49.223
<i>It was wonderful!</i>

27:49.320 --> 27:52.629
<i>Changes that normally
took hours took seconds.</i>

27:56.480 --> 27:57.741
<i>Dear Mrs. Watchett...</i>

27:59.680 --> 28:01.862
<i>always able to suggest a tie...</i>

28:01.920 --> 28:04.830
<i>but never wearing
anything more stylish...</i>

28:04.920 --> 28:07.500
<i>than what she's worn for years.</i>

28:08.160 --> 28:10.786
<i>Yet I was traveling very slowly.</i>

28:12.320 --> 28:14.149
<i>What if I went faster?</i>

28:41.720 --> 28:44.221
<i>It became intoxicating.</i>

28:45.160 --> 28:48.707
<i>I pushed the lever on
toward even greater speed.</i>

28:56.520 --> 29:00.022
<i>I gained experience in
handling the machine.</i>

29:01.040 --> 29:05.225
<i>I could stop for a day, an hour,
or even a second to observe.</i>

29:08.440 --> 29:11.066
<i>Then go ahead a year or two.</i>

29:11.240 --> 29:16.028
<i>I was able to see the changing
world in a series of glimpses.</i>

29:20.080 --> 29:23.104
Good heavens. That's a dress?

29:26.320 --> 29:28.104
<i>This was intriguing.</i>

29:28.760 --> 29:32.660
<i>I wondered just how far women
would permit this to go.</i>

29:51.120 --> 29:54.064
<i>I began to grow very
fond of that mannequin.</i>

29:54.760 --> 29:58.069
<i>Maybe because, like
me, she didn't age.</i>

30:11.760 --> 30:17.708
<i>Thirteen years passed.
Fourteen, 15, 16...</i>

30:19.800 --> 30:23.109
<i>Suddenly the light was gone.
What had happened?</i>

30:24.400 --> 30:28.425
<i>In the year 1917, I stopped.</i>

33:10.400 --> 33:11.626
Filby!

33:12.760 --> 33:15.466
Are you going to a
masquerade party?

33:19.160 --> 33:22.230
You look rather silly
without your mustache.

33:22.280 --> 33:25.589
- Were you addressing me, sir?
- It's George!

33:25.640 --> 33:28.266
I expected a more
enthusiastic greeting...

33:28.320 --> 33:30.821
You're confusing me with my father.

33:31.240 --> 33:35.664
Yes. There was quite a
resemblance. I'm James Filby.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.265
"Was"?

33:40.160 --> 33:42.831
- Were you a friend of Father's?
- Yes.

33:43.680 --> 33:44.906
Yes, I've been away.

33:45.880 --> 33:49.507
He was killed in the war.
A year ago.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.105
Oh.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.984
I'm so sorry.

34:00.600 --> 34:05.262
- And the gentleman across the street?
- Oh, the inventor chap?

34:06.240 --> 34:08.467
He disappeared around the
turn of the century.

34:09.639 --> 34:13.540
If you're interested in that
house, you can't buy it.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.791
- You can't even get inside.
- Why?

34:17.239 --> 34:22.904
My father was executor of the
estate and refused to liquidate it.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.748
I often chided him on that...

34:25.800 --> 34:29.347
but he believed the owner
would return some day.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.185
People hereabouts think it's
haunted, but, heh-heh...

34:35.239 --> 34:36.387
Who are you, sir?

34:39.239 --> 34:42.105
Just a stranger who
once knew your father.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.106
Have you been at the front?

34:47.120 --> 34:49.905
Front? What front?

34:49.960 --> 34:52.188
Why, the war, of course.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.143
What war?

34:55.199 --> 34:57.029
Good heavens!

34:57.600 --> 35:02.069
You don't know we've been at
war with Germany since 1914?

35:02.160 --> 35:04.991
I thought you'd just
returned from France.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.227
Or perhaps...

35:08.200 --> 35:11.065
Perhaps some tea might
make you feel better.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.430
Won't you come in?

35:15.240 --> 35:16.626
No, thank you.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.466
Are you sure you're all right?

35:23.440 --> 35:25.349
Yes, I'm quite all right.

35:26.400 --> 35:29.185
Then goodbye, sir.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.745
Goodbye, Jamey.

37:12.040 --> 37:15.269
<i>In 1940, I began to be
buffeted from side to side.</i>

37:15.320 --> 37:19.061
<i>I first thought the machine
had a mechanical defect.</i>

37:37.240 --> 37:42.187
<i>The last time I had stopped
was in 1917, 23 years ago.</i>

37:42.280 --> 37:48.023
<i>The war was still waging, now in
the air with flying machines.</i>

37:49.000 --> 37:53.310
<i>Then I realized the truth.
This was a new war.</i>

37:54.200 --> 37:58.464
<i>Uh, I decided to push on into
time and see the outcome of this.</i>

38:02.800 --> 38:04.026
<i>My house was hit!</i>

38:04.080 --> 38:07.627
<i>The flames shot up.
Instantly, my home was gone.</i>

38:07.720 --> 38:09.504
<i>I was in the open air.</i>

38:18.840 --> 38:22.467
<i>The years rolled by,
everything unfamiliar.</i>

38:24.960 --> 38:29.304
<i>Except the, uh, heh, smile
of my never-aging friend.</i>

38:30.600 --> 38:34.830
<i>What was this? Weird sounds
all around. What could it be?</i>

38:34.880 --> 38:37.506
<i>My curiosity compelled me to stop.</i>

38:55.040 --> 38:57.871
<i>At first I wondered if I was
the cause of the panic.</i>

39:02.400 --> 39:04.628
<i>I was soon to find out I wasn't.</i>

39:04.880 --> 39:06.903
Keep it moving! Shove it on!

39:16.600 --> 39:18.464
Come on, into the shelter.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.189
Come on, young man! Come on!

40:15.720 --> 40:18.061
- Filby?
- The name is Mr. Filby.

40:18.120 --> 40:21.747
- Didn't you hear the siren?
- The horrible screeching?

40:21.800 --> 40:24.870
It wasn't constructed for
its aesthetic value...

40:24.920 --> 40:28.024
but to warn young fools
to get into the shelter.

40:28.080 --> 40:31.787
- Now, come along.
- I'm perfectly comfortable here.

40:31.840 --> 40:34.591
I've got to talk to somebody.
This is fantastic!

40:34.640 --> 40:37.903
Your store is magnificent!
The achievements!

40:37.960 --> 40:42.941
- The gigantic strides man has taken!
- Come along, young man!

40:43.040 --> 40:45.586
The mushrooms will be sprouting!

40:45.640 --> 40:46.787
Mushrooms?

40:51.120 --> 40:55.384
You look familiar. Haven't
we met somewhere before?

40:55.440 --> 40:59.829
Indeed we have, Mr. Filby.
Right there. Many years ago.

41:00.560 --> 41:02.424
I was sure of that...

41:02.520 --> 41:04.782
but the exact time escapes me.

41:06.760 --> 41:10.831
It was two wars ago, 1917.

41:11.320 --> 41:15.630
Now I recall. The chap who
inquired about my father...

41:15.680 --> 41:19.466
and the house that used
to stand across the way.

41:20.480 --> 41:26.110
Oh, but no...
No, that's impossible!

41:26.160 --> 41:29.343
You haven't changed.
You're not a day older.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.830
And your clothes!

41:31.920 --> 41:34.944
Don't worry, Filby. It'll
take time to explain, but...

41:37.120 --> 41:40.463
That's the last alert!
Hurry! Hurry!

41:40.520 --> 41:43.271
- Listen, this is important.
- Look!

41:45.280 --> 41:49.783
An atomic satellite, zeroing in.
That's important.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.510
Come on! Come on!

41:51.560 --> 41:53.901
- But I've got to talk to you!
- Come on!

41:53.960 --> 41:55.141
Filby?

41:55.800 --> 41:56.947
Filby!

41:57.000 --> 42:00.149
Hurry! Hide till the all-clear!

42:00.240 --> 42:03.264
But, Filby, I've got
to talk to you!

42:36.480 --> 42:40.790
<i>The labor of centuries,
gone in an instant.</i>

42:51.720 --> 42:54.505
<i>Mother Earth, aroused
by man's violence...</i>

42:54.560 --> 42:57.311
<i>responded with volcanic
violence of her own.</i>

43:56.440 --> 44:01.831
<i>Only my speed through time saved
me from being encased in stone.</i>

44:03.560 --> 44:05.150
<i>The molten rock cooled.</i>

44:13.960 --> 44:15.744
<i>I prayed...</i>

44:15.800 --> 44:18.983
<i>wondering how many
eons must pass...</i>

44:19.040 --> 44:23.031
<i>before the wind and rain could
wear away the mountain.</i>

44:36.680 --> 44:38.066
<i>Darkness.</i>

44:40.320 --> 44:43.344
<i>Darkness for centuries.</i>

44:45.280 --> 44:49.305
<i>I wondered if there was still
a war being waged above me...</i>

44:49.360 --> 44:53.306
<i>if man would still exist
when I saw the sun again.</i>

44:54.200 --> 44:56.109
<i>The centuries rolled by.</i>

44:57.840 --> 45:00.068
<i>I put my trust in time...</i>

45:00.120 --> 45:03.986
<i>and waited for the
rock to wear down.</i>

45:06.400 --> 45:07.911
<i>I was free again!</i>

45:17.040 --> 45:21.543
<i>Thousands of centuries had passed,
but the Earth stayed green.</i>

45:21.600 --> 45:24.101
<i>There was no winter, no wars.</i>

45:24.760 --> 45:28.945
<i>Had man learned to control
both the elements and himself?</i>

45:29.920 --> 45:31.704
<i>I had to stop and find out.</i>

45:50.720 --> 45:52.584
<i>But I'd stopped too fast.</i>

47:10.840 --> 47:12.351
<i>Magnificent!</i>

47:13.880 --> 47:16.631
<i>Beautiful flowers everywhere!</i>

47:17.760 --> 47:20.704
<i>Natural splendor beyond compare.</i>

47:24.240 --> 47:28.504
<i>The whole landscape a garden
without any weeds or briars.</i>

47:29.400 --> 47:33.744
<i>Trees and vines laden with fruit
of strange shapes and colors.</i>

47:34.480 --> 47:37.026
<i>Nature tamed completely...</i>

47:37.120 --> 47:40.064
<i>and more bountiful than ever!</i>

47:40.120 --> 47:42.507
<i>At last I'd found a paradise.</i>

47:45.240 --> 47:49.186
<i>But it would be no paradise
if it was mine alone.</i>

48:10.640 --> 48:15.667
<i>Unrepaired for centuries.
Maybe unlived-in for as long.</i>

49:31.240 --> 49:33.024
Anybody here?

51:48.920 --> 51:53.628
<i>So this is man's future: to bask in
the sun, bathe in the streams...</i>

51:53.760 --> 51:58.263
<i>and eat the fruits of the Earth,
work and hardship forgotten.</i>

51:59.360 --> 52:00.985
Well, and why not?

52:28.360 --> 52:30.781
Don't just sit there! Help her!

53:23.440 --> 53:24.905
Are you all right?

54:23.600 --> 54:24.986
Thank you.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.990
- Why did you?
- Why did I what?

54:31.120 --> 54:32.551
Come after me.

54:35.920 --> 54:37.510
Sit down.

54:42.200 --> 54:43.950
I did it to save your life.

54:44.480 --> 54:48.346
That doesn't seem to mean
much to you, or anybody else.

54:48.400 --> 54:50.229
It doesn't.

54:51.440 --> 54:54.544
Twenty of your friends
were watching you drown.

54:54.640 --> 54:57.710
Not one lifted a
finger to save you.

54:57.760 --> 55:00.022
That's a very curious attitude.

55:02.520 --> 55:04.145
A very curious world.

55:07.360 --> 55:12.102
Uh, aren't you interested in who
I am? Where I come from?

55:12.680 --> 55:14.020
Should I be?

55:18.280 --> 55:22.430
Take me to somebody a little
older. Somebody I can talk to.

55:22.480 --> 55:24.230
There is no one older.

55:26.640 --> 55:28.822
Do you mean nobody ages
in this land of yours?

55:33.240 --> 55:37.390
- Well, what's your name?
- Weena.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.025
Weena.

55:40.960 --> 55:42.710
How do you spell it?

55:44.960 --> 55:48.462
- Spell?
- Spell, write. Can't you write?

55:50.240 --> 55:51.626
Look.

55:54.640 --> 55:55.980
Weena.

55:59.160 --> 56:01.661
- What are your people called?
- Eloi.

56:01.720 --> 56:03.185
Aha.

56:04.280 --> 56:06.587
Eloi.

56:14.960 --> 56:16.471
Come. We must go now.

56:16.600 --> 56:19.021
- What's wrong?
- It's getting dark.

56:44.240 --> 56:45.466
Hello.

56:47.280 --> 56:50.031
I don't mind telling
you, I'm quite hungry.

56:51.480 --> 56:53.708
I've come a long, long way.

56:57.840 --> 57:00.750
In my time, a berry that size...

57:00.800 --> 57:03.744
would've been big news
all over the world.

57:08.920 --> 57:10.226
Excuse me, sir.

57:11.280 --> 57:13.269
Uh, sir?

57:17.600 --> 57:21.227
Perhaps curiosity has died.
Perhaps courtesy too...

57:21.280 --> 57:24.907
but I've come far and I'd
like to know things.

57:25.480 --> 57:26.627
Why?

57:31.040 --> 57:35.987
Because I shall return to my time,
and my people will ask questions.

57:36.800 --> 57:38.425
Such as:

57:39.000 --> 57:41.501
What kind of government
rules your world?

57:42.240 --> 57:44.627
We have no government.

57:45.920 --> 57:50.821
Well, you must have a body of
men who pass and enforce laws.

57:51.760 --> 57:54.261
Laws? There are no laws.

57:58.360 --> 58:01.225
Where do you get food and clothing?

58:02.680 --> 58:04.464
Doesn't anybody work?

58:05.080 --> 58:06.511
No.

58:07.440 --> 58:10.669
Well, where does that come from?

58:10.720 --> 58:14.711
- It grows. It always grows.
- I know, but it must be...

58:15.600 --> 58:17.941
cultivated and planted
and nurtured, um...

58:21.640 --> 58:23.230
Well, unless you...

58:23.280 --> 58:29.023
You have an economy so well-developed
that you can spend all your time...

58:29.080 --> 58:32.263
studying and experimenting?
Is that right?

58:32.360 --> 58:33.666
You ask many questions.

58:38.200 --> 58:42.225
Well, that is the only way man
has learned and developed.

58:42.800 --> 58:44.140
I wish to learn.

58:47.160 --> 58:50.343
I want to learn about
your civilization.

58:57.440 --> 58:58.985
Perhaps, you...

58:59.040 --> 59:00.221
Do you have books?

59:01.560 --> 59:03.230
Books?

59:03.480 --> 59:06.390
- Yes, we have books.
- Wonderful!

59:06.440 --> 59:10.943
I can learn about you from books.
They'll tell me what I want to know.

59:12.880 --> 59:14.823
Could I see the books?

59:47.760 --> 59:50.340
Yes, they do tell me all about you.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.188
What have you done?

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:11.504
Thousands of years of building,
rebuilding, creating and re-creating...

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.351
so you can let it crumble to dust!

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.266
A million years of sensitive
men dying for their dreams.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.546
For what?

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.142
So you can swim and dance...

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.825
and play!

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.908
You! All of you!

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.750
I'm going back! I won't bother to
tell of the useless struggle...

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.547
the hopeless future. But at
least I'll die among men!

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.301
You're... Aah!

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.983
- Weena, what are you doing?
- I came to warn you.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.701
- How do you open that panel?
- No one can. Only the Morlocks.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.865
Who are the Morlocks?

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.622
They give us our food and
clothes. We must obey.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.431
Why'd they take my machine?

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.944
You've got to tell me!

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.142
We mustn't be out in the dark.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.711
Only children are
frightened by the dark.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.704
You are a child, aren't you?

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.585
- I'll light a fire.
- Please, let us go.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.025
My machine is inside. I must
find a way to get it out.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.389
- No, you mustn't.
- Help me gather some wood.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.311
Come on.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.106
That's a girl.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.871
Where are you from?

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.065
As a matter of fact,
I'm from right here.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.902
That's where my house used to be...

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.903
many thousands of years ago.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.346
You see there?

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.146
Up to those panels
was my laboratory.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.429
Beyond them was where
my garden used to be.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.027
And right there...

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.308
that was my library.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.343
Where I once sat talking
with friends about...

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.104
the time machine.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.785
Mm.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:14.946
You know, Weena...

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.623
I'd hoped to learn
such a great deal.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.424
I hoped to take back the knowledge
and advancement man had made.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.702
Instead, I find vegetables.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.024
The human race reduced
to living vegetables.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:49.585
They're gone. Are you all right?

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.948
- Was that a Morlock?
- Yes.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.343
Don't you worry. The fire
seems to keep them away.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:17.661
What are you doing? Why did
you put your hand there?

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.591
- I never saw it before.
- You...?

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.425
No knowledge of fire.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.785
No books.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.350
I'm terribly sorry.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.389
I had no right to be
angry with your people.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:47.666
No more than if I'd visited the
island of Bali in my own time.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.505
But, you know, Weena...

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.983
you were safe inside your
house, yet came out to warn me.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.985
The characteristic which
distinguished man from animals...

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.501
was the spirit of self-sacrifice.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.589
And you have that quality.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:15.944
So do all your people. It just
needs someone to reawaken it.

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:21.861
I'd like to try, if you'll let me.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.100
Will you?

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.109
I do not understand...

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:29.462
- ...but I believe you.
- Heh.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.542
That's as good a start as any.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.461
Try to tell me. The Morlocks...
Who or what are they?

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.107
Are they animals or people?

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.584
Well, what about yourself?

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.904
Don't your people ever
speak of the past?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.750
There is no past.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.224
Well, do they ever
wonder about the future?

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.380
There is no future.

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.870
The past...

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.385
man's past...

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:17.185
is mainly a grim
struggle for survival.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.582
But there have been moments when
a few voices have spoken up...

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.821
and these rare moments
have made man's past...

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.308
a glorious thing.

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:35.111
I refuse to believe
it's dead and gone.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:39.947
We've had dark ages before.
This is just another one.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:44.060
All it needs is someone
to show you the way out.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.988
I'm only a mechanic...

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:53.502
but I'm sure there must be
that spark in one of you.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.620
If only I can kindle that spark...

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.862
my coming here will have meaning.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.630
<i>My efforts to open the
panel were fruitless.</i>

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.142
<i>I had to find another way
to retrieve my machine.</i>

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.506
Listen.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.071
Do you hear that?

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.541
Yes.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.265
Machines?

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.743
- No, Morlocks.
- Wait.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.502
Those animals run machines?

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.789
They are Morlocks.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.230
- Have you ever seen the machines?
- No, only heard of them.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.821
- Who told you?
- The rings.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.391
- What sort of rings?
- Rings that talk.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.907
Could you show me these rings?

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.189
Come, this way.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.381
- These are the talking rings?
- Yes.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.390
They speak?

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.026
Of what?

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.421
Things no one here understands.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.350
Make it talk.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:49.501
<i>Now in its 326th year, the war
between the East and West...</i>

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.989
<i>has at last come to an end.</i>

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:56.306
<i>There's nothing to fight
with and few left to fight.</i>

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.228
<i>The atmosphere has become
so polluted with germs...</i>

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.826
<i>that it can no longer be breathed.</i>

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.581
<i>There is no place
left that is immune.</i>

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:11.261
<i>The last factory for the manufacture
of oxygen has been destroyed.</i>

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.750
<i>Stockpiles are rapidly
diminishing...</i>

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.506
<i>and when they are
gone, we must die.</i>

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:32.863
<i>My name is of no consequence.</i>

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:39.266
<i>You should know that I am the last
who remembers how each of us...</i>

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.584
<i>man and woman, made
his own decision.</i>

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:47.501
<i>Some chose to take refuge
in the great caverns...</i>

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:52.029
<i>and find a new way of life
below the Earth's surface.</i>

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.985
<i>The rest of us decided to take
our chances in the sunlight...</i>

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.350
<i>small as those chances might be.</i>

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:07.183
<i>From the rings I learned how
the human race divided...</i>

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:11.180
<i>and how the world of the
Eloi and the Morlocks began.</i>

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.702
<i>By some awful quirk of fate...</i>

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:20.627
<i>the Morlocks became the masters
and the Eloi their servants.</i>

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:24.741
<i>The Morlocks maintained
them and bred them like...</i>

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.345
<i>Like cattle...</i>

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.902
<i>only to take them below
when they reached maturity.</i>

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.309
<i>Which explained why there
were no older people.</i>

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:38.586
<i>I knew I must go below. It was the
only way to reach my machine...</i>

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.624
<i>and discover what happened
to the little people.</i>

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.391
Don't go!

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.022
- You won't come back!
- I'll be back.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.547
Weena?

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.790
Weena!

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.707
Weena?

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.067
Weena?

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.066
Weena?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.545
Answer me!

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.385
Where are you?

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.665
What's happening?

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.540
What's happening?

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.983
What's the matter with you all?

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.945
Weena!

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.626
Weena?

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.625
Weena?

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.705
Weena, stop!

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.387
Weena?

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.625
Stop!

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.904
What happens to them?

01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:00.466
Don't stand there like fatted cattle!
Will you answer me?

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.622
- What is wrong?
- Nothing is wrong. It is all clear.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.062
- What do you mean, all clear?
- All clear.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.181
In the mid-1900s, the bombs, the
people calling out, "All clear!"

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.461
No!

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.782
That's gone! That's passed!

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:28.945
There are no more flying machines!
No bombs! No more wars!

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.389
The rings have told us that story.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.828
But you didn't listen!
You didn't learn!

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.742
It was ages ago that men were taught
to hide when the sirens blew...

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.625
to run from death, but it's over!

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.063
Those men and those who
slaughtered them are dead!

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:52.341
But there is nothing to
fear. It is all clear.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.188
What about the ones who went below?
How will they come back?

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.581
They never come back.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:06.105
- Nobody can bring them back.
- You can try. You can try!

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.065
Won't even one of you try?

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.905
Well, I'll try!

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:35.710
<i>So this was the
destiny of the Eloi.</i>

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.943
<i>They were being bred
by the Morlocks...</i>

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.991
<i>who had degenerated into the
lowest form of human life:</i>

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.266
<i>Cannibalism!</i>

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.144
Wake up! Come to your
senses! All of you!

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.707
Burn.

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.151
Give me something to burn.
It's my last match.

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.744
Good, good.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.941
Get up the stairs!
That's the way out!

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.065
The torch!

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.024
Get the torch!

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:35.631
Get up the steps! Hurry up!

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.626
Come on, hurry!

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.910
Go on, Weena.

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:21.989
Gather all the deadwood!
All the wood!

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:26.111
That's fine. Come on,
throw it down!

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.585
All the deadwood!

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.827
Throw it down! Do the
same to the other wells!

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.903
All the wood down the wells!

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.503
All right, to the river!
Back to the river!

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.024
All right, let's go!

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:37.548
<i>Another night was coming, but this
night no Eloi needed to fear.</i>

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:44.629
<i>The underworld of the
Morlocks was gone...</i>

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.704
<i>and so was the life of
leisure for the Eloi.</i>

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.864
<i>But then what of me?</i>

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.870
<i>I was imprisoned in a world...</i>

01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:58.751
<i>in which I just did not belong.</i>

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.510
Are you sorry?

01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:08.142
- Hm? Sorry? Sorry for what?
- That you have to stay?

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.701
Yes.

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:17.223
I could tell so much to
the people of my time.

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.141
I'd let them know...

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:23.103
about the sorrow and happiness
that the future holds.

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:26.108
Maybe they could learn from it.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:28.741
Or could they?

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:35.466
- You don't want to stay, do you?
- It isn't that.

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:40.829
It's just that I don't fit here, any
more than you would in my time.

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.981
I would love to see your time.

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.781
Mm-mm. You wouldn't
be very happy there.

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.503
Do you have someone there?
Someone like me?

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.384
No one like you.

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:01.063
I have friends who will
miss me, of course.

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:03.389
I'm probably late already.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.025
Women?

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.230
No.

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.224
There is one woman.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:20.382
She looks after my house for me.
She's 62 years old and all wrinkled.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:28.187
How do they wear their hair?

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.308
- Who?
- The women of your time.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.628
- Up.
- Up?

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.265
Up how?

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:42.627
I don't know. Kind of...

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.145
up, like that.

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.620
Show me!

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:04.063
Would I be pretty?

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.906
Yes, you would. Very pretty.

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.301
Oh, Weena.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.621
I wish we could go back to my time.

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.623
Or even before that, when
the world was young.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.903
- We could be so very happy.
- Look!

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.864
Look!

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.750
Look!

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.745
My machine!

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.861
Come on, Weena!

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.147
Weena!

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:12.148
<i>I was going the wrong way!
Back! I had to go back!</i>

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:17.948
It's the most ridiculous story
I've ever heard. Preposterous!

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.861
George, you always could
tell a good yarn.

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:24.586
You're a truly great
inventor, George.

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.148
I think you ought to retire, sir.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.071
Truthfully, George, where
have you been the past week?

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.746
Don't ask such questions.

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.621
It is not hard for a man to
lose a week now and again.

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:46.907
I can understand your doubt.
Take it as a lie if you wish.

01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.224
I scarcely believe it myself,
now that I'm back...

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.984
David, there's the
flower Weena gave me.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:06.025
A present for you. You're
interested in botany.

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.905
Try to match that with
any known species!

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.467
I don't think I can.

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:22.305
- Well, time to go, Bridewell.
- Mm? Oh.

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.623
- Yes, it is getting late.
- Good night, George.

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.020
Good night, George.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.830
Good night.

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.302
You look exhausted, George. You
really should get some rest.

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:03.746
Good night. It's grand
having you back.

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:05.747
Goodbye, David.

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:18.107
Thanks for being such a
good friend. Always.

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.987
What do you think, Filby?

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.585
One thing is certain.

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:40.829
That flower couldn't
bloom in the wintertime.

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:43.711
You don't really
believe that story?

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:46.261
Good night.

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.711
Go on, driver.

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.906
George?

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:40.304
- Mr. Filby, what...?
- He's gone!

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:43.985
Why, look!

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:56.631
I think I understand.
You see the imprint?

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:01.228
This is where it originally stood.

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.109
The Morlocks moved it.

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:06.791
They dragged it across the lawn...

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.990
right into the sphinx. Right there.

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:16.746
Weena was standing here
when he last saw her.

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:21.269
Right here! The same space
in a different time.

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:26.829
So he dragged his heavy
machine back in here...

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:29.265
scratching the floor...

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.390
so he could appear outside
the sphinx again...

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:37.305
and help the Eloi
build a new world.

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.671
Build a new world for himself.

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:46.583
- Right where he left her.
- Yes.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.866
It's not like George to
return empty-handed.

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:04.308
To try to rebuild a
civilization without a plan.

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.940
He must have taken
something with him.

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:11.386
Nothing.

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:22.227
- Except three books.
- Which three books?

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:26.707
I don't know. Is it important?

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.661
Oh, I suppose not.

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:32.626
Only...

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.107
which three would you have taken?

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:45.910
Do you think he'll ever return?

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.902
One cannot choose but wonder.

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:53.668
You see, he has all
the time in the world.
