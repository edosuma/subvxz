Dean, come on now!
We just wanna talk! Open the door!

00:38.550 --> 00:40.484
{fire alarm ringing)

00:47.693 --> 00:48.853
Open that door.

00:49.695 --> 00:52.789
Aah!

00:56.001 --> 00:58.231
D.C. Metro.
Our partner's trapped inside.

00:58.303 --> 00:59.531
Evacuate this building.

01:01.373 --> 01:04.308
{sirens wailing/horns honking)

01:05.877 --> 01:08.437
Control. we have
approaching emergency vehicles.

01:08.513 --> 01:10.743
Show's going public,
and they're at the front door.

01:10.816 --> 01:13.979
- Stand down. Maintain visual perimeter.
- We're outta here.

01:15.654 --> 01:17.679
{shouting)

01:19.091 --> 01:22.583
Chavez on the 15th floor. We got one man
trapped and possibly down.

01:22.661 --> 01:24.526
There's a guy trapped in there.

01:35.774 --> 01:38.208
You're going to be OK, guy.
You'll be all right.

01:38.276 --> 01:42.474
{siren blaring)

01:42.547 --> 01:46.381
- OK, we are traveling. Known destination?
- St. Elizabeth's.

01:46.451 --> 01:49.181
- We need sat backup now.
- It's already done.

01:58.697 --> 02:00.528
Take it easy, guy.
You'll be all right.

02:00.599 --> 02:02.260
Calm down. It's OK.

02:05.137 --> 02:08.698
- Easy, fella.
- I gotta go. Stop the ambulance.

02:08.774 --> 02:10.674
- Tell him to stop it now!

02:10.741 --> 02:12.607
- Pull over, George.
- Easy, fella.

02:15.881 --> 02:18.441
- He's getting out!
- Son of a bitch!

02:20.719 --> 02:22.744
He's escaped the ambulance
and is on foot.

02:22.821 --> 02:24.812
Our guys are in pursuit.
Hold that coordinate.

02:24.890 --> 02:30.226
LAT. 39 degrees. 27 minutes.
LONG. 7 4 degrees. 42 minutes.

02:33.265 --> 02:36.428
- Move, guys.
- Go, go, go! Damn it! Go around!

02:45.177 --> 02:48.044
- You're on. Go.
- Tunnel Control, this is D.C. Metro.

02:48.113 --> 02:51.344
In pursuit armed felon in tunnel.
Requesting video help.

02:53.451 --> 02:56.887
Metro, this is Tunnel Control.
We got a 20 on your suspect.

02:56.955 --> 02:59.446
- Heading south in tunnel six.
- Copy that.

03:01.793 --> 03:05.194
We got him. He's right
in front of us. Tunnel six.

03:05.263 --> 03:07.754
He's heading down tunnel six.
He's got nowhere to go.

03:12.137 --> 03:15.436
He's crossed over.
He's on the wrong side.

03:19.644 --> 03:21.509
Stop! Stop!

03:24.516 --> 03:27.644
We lost him. We lost him.
Son of a bitch! Pull over.

03:30.322 --> 03:33.086
He's currently entering
vertical stairwell five.

03:33.158 --> 03:37.060
- Where does that lead?
- Main access to sub-ventilation tunnel.

03:37.128 --> 03:41.189
- Closest vehicular access?
- Adjacent utility entrance, south side.

03:41.266 --> 03:43.826
Copy that.
He's in the ventilation tunnel.

03:43.902 --> 03:46.166
Proceed to the utility
entrance on the south side.

03:46.238 --> 03:49.605
- There is no visual coverage.
- He's in a ventilation tunnel.

03:49.674 --> 03:53.075
There's a service entrance
at the south end! Come on! Let's go!

03:53.144 --> 03:55.305
Come on! Go!

04:03.255 --> 04:05.120
Aah!

04:13.765 --> 04:15.494
{cars approaching)

04:25.377 --> 04:28.540
{grunting)

04:30.515 --> 04:32.881
{horn honking)

04:36.221 --> 04:39.190
{horn honking)

04:45.730 --> 04:48.563
{singing reggae)

04:52.537 --> 04:53.902
Normally, I wouldn't do this.

04:53.972 --> 04:56.406
Do you guys have him?
Talk to me, people.

04:56.474 --> 04:58.271
{horns honking)

05:00.111 --> 05:02.579
{tires screeching)

05:07.752 --> 05:11.119
Shit! Shit!

05:17.796 --> 05:19.593
Why is this so difficult?

05:19.664 --> 05:22.531
He shed the sensors. He's clever.
And he's had help.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.431
Maybe it's the real Brill.

05:24.502 --> 05:27.062
There's 23 Brills in
the Baltimore/D.C. area.

05:27.138 --> 05:29.572
None check out.
We're running it through EPLC now.

05:29.641 --> 05:32.872
- Do you think we're being set up?
- Somebody in the agency?

05:32.944 --> 05:35.708
I don't know.

05:35.780 --> 05:39.546
It just tastes a little off, doesn't it?

05:39.617 --> 05:43.109
- I know what you mean.
- Let's raise the stakes.

05:43.188 --> 05:46.521
Make things more serious for Mr. Dean.
We'll both think about how, OK?

05:46.591 --> 05:48.616
OK. Good.

05:54.332 --> 05:57.301
- Anything wrong?
- No.

05:59.738 --> 06:03.936
You should have made deputy director
two years ago, maybe three.

06:04.009 --> 06:09.777
But it'll happen now.
Once this bill passes, that'll be it for you.

06:16.788 --> 06:19.256
Thanks. Maria.

06:20.558 --> 06:23.550
{barking)

06:27.499 --> 06:31.833
Porsche, what are you barking at, boy?

06:31.903 --> 06:34.030
{growling)

06:38.076 --> 06:39.976
{barking)

06:41.846 --> 06:43.143
Porsche?

06:44.682 --> 06:46.547
- Shh, shh. It's me.
- I know it's you.

06:46.618 --> 06:49.815
- You scared the shit out of me.
- The house is bugged.

06:49.888 --> 06:51.981
Everything you say,
they can hear and see.

06:52.057 --> 06:54.184
Listen to me. Listen, listen.

06:54.259 --> 06:57.820
I never - I swear to God.
I never - this is the truth.

06:57.896 --> 07:01.024
I never, ever since the problem,
touched Rachel like that.

07:01.099 --> 07:05.195
I never even looked at her like that, honey.
I love you.

07:05.270 --> 07:08.364
I love you, and that is it.
That is it. Only you.

07:08.440 --> 07:13.139
- What about Eric?
- And Eric.

07:13.211 --> 07:16.738
And I love your family.
Except for your dad.

07:19.350 --> 07:22.649
I need you. I need you real bad.
OK?

07:25.824 --> 07:26.950
OK.

07:29.727 --> 07:31.718
I told you, Bobby.

07:31.796 --> 07:34.128
I told you they had
this type of capability.

07:34.199 --> 07:37.794
And that goddamn privacy bill is just
another way for them to expand the power.

07:37.869 --> 07:40.804
- Shh.
- Don't you "shh" me.

07:43.241 --> 07:47.302
You were right. I was wrong.
It's not time for the "l told you so" speech.

07:47.378 --> 07:51.906
That day when Daniel Zavitz
got hit by the fire truck, he was running.

07:51.983 --> 07:55.316
The people that were chasing him,
that's the people that are chasing me.

07:55.386 --> 07:56.910
Bobby, are you serious?

07:56.988 --> 08:00.424
Go to Philadelphia, stay with your family.
Give me time to work this out.

08:00.492 --> 08:04.223
I don't think so. They're not
chasing me out of my house.

08:04.295 --> 08:06.695
They're not chasing me.
I picked those drapes.

08:06.764 --> 08:09.528
Shh, shh, shh.
Nobody cares about the drapes.

08:09.601 --> 08:12.695
Just one time can I make
some decisions around here?

08:12.770 --> 08:15.671
Just go to Philadelphia.
I need you to do that for me, OK?

08:15.740 --> 08:19.938
- OK.
- I miss you.

08:21.646 --> 08:23.910
Oh, God.

08:29.354 --> 08:31.413
That's a Christmas present.

08:31.489 --> 08:34.754
I know. I'm sorry.
But, baby, I missed you. I was lonely.

08:34.826 --> 08:37.056
How you just gonna
go through my stuff like that?

08:37.128 --> 08:40.029
Until I actually give it to you,
that's still mine.

08:40.097 --> 08:42.828
Yeah, but it looks better on me,
don't you think?

08:44.702 --> 08:47.034
Baby, you're as bad as Eric.

08:47.105 --> 08:50.506
I missed you so much.

08:54.179 --> 08:56.147
- What?
- That was the night.

08:56.214 --> 08:59.047
That was the night that I came home
with the presents.

08:59.117 --> 09:01.551
- Where is Eric?
- He's at Dylan's house.

09:01.619 --> 09:04.281
He's probably on the way to school.
What's going on?

09:04.355 --> 09:06.687
{gasps) What are you doing with that?

09:06.758 --> 09:08.316
Shh, baby. Shh, shh.
Take it.

09:08.393 --> 09:10.384
I don't want it. What do you
want me to do with this?

09:10.461 --> 09:13.953
Get me some money. I need some clothes.
Tell Maria we need her car.

09:14.032 --> 09:18.366
Chances are they wouldn't have bugged it.
Oh, shit. Eric.

09:27.979 --> 09:30.004
Base, this is unit one.
The nanny is leaving.

09:30.081 --> 09:32.015
- Please advise.
- Stay put.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.381
We have satellite
and Bingham at the school.

09:43.528 --> 09:47.430
Aw, man, let me follow the nanny..

09:47.498 --> 09:51.025
She doesn't shave her legs. Jesus!

09:51.102 --> 09:53.002
Women like that are so hot.

09:54.706 --> 09:57.800
One time, let me follow the nanny!

09:57.875 --> 10:02.369
You know what that means, don't you?
With them hairy legs...

10:02.447 --> 10:05.416
{whistling)

10:06.184 --> 10:10.143
Deep dish bush.

10:10.221 --> 10:12.121
You're a sick fuck.

10:12.190 --> 10:15.853
- {Dean) Is there anybody following us?
- No. No, Mr. Bobby.

10:15.927 --> 10:18.794
Drive faster. I wanna catch 'em
before they get to school.

10:22.267 --> 10:24.360
{children shouting)

10:25.737 --> 10:28.205
- There they are.
- Pull up and tell them to get in the car.

10:28.273 --> 10:30.241
OK.

10:31.276 --> 10:33.540
Eric, Dylan, get in the car, please.

10:33.611 --> 10:36.045
- No, we're OK.
- Get in the car right now.

10:36.114 --> 10:41.245
- But school's right down the block.
- You heard me. Now, get.

10:52.430 --> 10:54.523
- What's up, fellas?
- Dad?

10:54.599 --> 10:57.090
No, no. Turn around. Sit down.
Face forward.

10:57.168 --> 10:58.999
- But, Dad...
- What did I say, Eric?

10:59.070 --> 11:01.868
Pick a spot on those seats.
We're gonna play a game.

11:01.939 --> 11:06.137
Pick a spot and look right at it. You can't
let anyone know I'm back here, OK?

11:07.178 --> 11:09.078
How you been, E.?
I missed you, man.

11:09.147 --> 11:11.672
I missed you, too, Dad.
Where did you go?

11:11.749 --> 11:14.775
Oh, they've been keeping me
really busy on this case.

11:14.852 --> 11:16.752
They're trying to work me to death.

11:16.821 --> 11:19.949
- Are you and Mom getting a divorce?
- Face forward.

11:20.625 --> 11:23.423
What are you talking about?
No, we're not getting a divorce.

11:23.494 --> 11:26.622
We had a little fight.
Sometimes married couples have fights.

11:26.698 --> 11:29.895
- That's nothing for you to worry about.
- Who won the fight?

11:29.967 --> 11:33.266
This is your dad, Eric.
When I put my foot down, that's it.

11:33.338 --> 11:37.274
- My mom won.
- I have a question I need to ask you.

11:37.342 --> 11:40.277
It is absolutely imperative
that you tell me the truth.

11:40.345 --> 11:44.247
Now, no matter what you say,
you are not gonna get in trouble.

11:44.315 --> 11:46.306
- All right? You ready?
- Yeah.

11:46.384 --> 11:49.251
Remember that night I had
those Christmas presents...?

11:49.320 --> 11:51.413
I just looked in the bag, Dad.

11:51.489 --> 11:54.117
I wouldn't have taken it,
except it was already open.

11:54.192 --> 11:57.457
All right, so we're clear.
But I need it.

11:57.528 --> 11:59.257
I promise I'll get you another one.

11:59.330 --> 12:01.321
- Dad.
- What's the matter?

12:01.399 --> 12:02.388
It's broken.

12:02.467 --> 12:06.426
It's not Eric's fault, Mr. Dean.
It was always broken.

12:06.504 --> 12:08.938
The screen just scrambles
when you turn it on.

12:09.006 --> 12:12.965
- But I need it. Do you have it here?
- Yeah, we have it.

12:13.044 --> 12:15.137
Eric, just pass it
around the side to me.

12:36.934 --> 12:39.801
{Dean) Yes. Hello. Hi.
My name is Leon Newman.

12:39.871 --> 12:42.101
I'm sorry.
What's your name, ma'am?

12:42.173 --> 12:45.336
Sergeant Miller. Yes, we live
at 454 Beaumont Terrace.

12:45.410 --> 12:47.844
Actually, my mother lives there.
I'm calling for her.

12:47.912 --> 12:51.040
There's been a van
sitting outside all day.

12:51.115 --> 12:53.675
I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble,

12:53.751 --> 12:56.879
but I think they might be doing drugs
or something in there.

12:56.954 --> 12:58.717
I was hoping you
could send a car by.

12:59.791 --> 13:02.453
- {beeping)
- {dispatcher) Allison. all available units.

13:02.527 --> 13:07.692
Check out a white van at 454 Beaumont
for a possible 1031narcotics violation.

13:07.765 --> 13:10.700
- Oh, eat me. That's us.
- Yup.

13:35.092 --> 13:37.083
{knocks on door)

13:48.372 --> 13:50.306
Rachel.

13:50.908 --> 13:52.603
Rachel.

15:12.924 --> 15:14.391
Oh, shit.

15:45.756 --> 15:48.589
Open the door.
Open the door!

15:56.734 --> 15:58.668
I told you to stay the fuck away from me.

15:58.736 --> 16:01.204
Please, not now. Just drive.

16:07.778 --> 16:11.874
- All right, what happened?
- Rachel's dead.

16:16.954 --> 16:20.685
I told you not to contact her.
I told you.

16:25.863 --> 16:28.195
Get out of the car.

16:28.265 --> 16:30.790
I found what they're looking for.
My son had it.

16:30.868 --> 16:33.302
Get out of the fucking car.

17:14.645 --> 17:16.771
Give me the toy.

17:26.290 --> 17:29.851
- You know why they killed her?
- Trying to make it look like it was me.

17:29.927 --> 17:32.020
They had my stuff planted
all over her house.

17:32.830 --> 17:36.926
First, if you're a murder suspect,
you're gonna be easier to find,

17:37.001 --> 17:41.233
and second, to discredit you,
in case you ever go public against them.

17:41.305 --> 17:45.241
The NSA set you up.
It had nothing to do with Rachel.

17:46.444 --> 17:48.139
Absolutely nothing.

17:55.286 --> 17:58.551
- What have we got?
- We got nothing.

17:58.622 --> 18:02.388
Pull up everything we have on tape.
The square, the house surveillance.

18:02.460 --> 18:05.520
Van, give me the sat imagery
of the hotel roof.

18:05.596 --> 18:10.863
OK, here. These are the parametrics for
the space vehicle during data acquisition.

18:10.935 --> 18:14.200
Can we take a look at this guy
who's helping him? Who is he?

18:16.273 --> 18:21.176
- Can you get a feature extraction?
- Mm-mm. He never looks up.

18:21.245 --> 18:23.805
- He's smart.
- Why does he have to look up?

18:23.881 --> 18:27.977
The satellite's about 155 miles above
the Earth. It can only look straight down.

18:28.052 --> 18:31.215
- That's kind of limited.
- Maybe you can design a new one.

18:31.288 --> 18:32.550
Maybe I will, idiot.

18:32.623 --> 18:37.526
I got it. Let me talk to the nanny.
Maybe she can help.

18:37.595 --> 18:39.222
That's a good idea, Fiedler.

18:43.868 --> 18:45.961
Stay put. I need some food.
I need to eat.

18:47.037 --> 18:49.870
{radio) * Rockin' around
the Christmas tree

18:49.940 --> 18:53.501
* Let the Christmas spirit ring

18:54.044 --> 18:56.569
* Later we'll have some pumpkin pie

18:56.647 --> 19:00.083
* And we'll do some caroling

19:00.151 --> 19:03.143
* You will get a sentiment...

19:05.389 --> 19:06.686
{rings)

19:06.757 --> 19:08.247
- Hello.
- Yeah, it's me.

19:08.325 --> 19:10.919
Oh, it's you, asshole.
What are you calling me for?

19:10.995 --> 19:12.053
Shut up and listen.

19:12.129 --> 19:15.496
Go to the house. Go.
Do not call Carla.

19:15.566 --> 19:19.434
Rachel Banks is dead. The papers will
make it sound like I killed her.

19:19.503 --> 19:21.596
Tell her that I didn't do it.

19:21.672 --> 19:25.540
Make sure she goes. Get her out of there.
Tell 'em I love 'em.

19:25.609 --> 19:31.343
The call is coming from 840 McClean,
Baltimore, between Hood and St. Anne's.

19:31.415 --> 19:33.076
Copy that. Yes!

19:52.670 --> 19:54.535
What's up, man?

19:54.605 --> 19:58.063
We need your surveillance tapes for
the last 20 minutes.

19:58.642 --> 19:59.768
Hey, Larry!

19:59.844 --> 20:02.813
The surveillance footage
is coming in now from Pratt.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.314
Freeze it and process it
for face recognition.

20:14.692 --> 20:17.786
Pratt, do we see
which way the car went?

20:17.862 --> 20:20.888
No. sir. This kid here at the register
thinks that it went south.

20:20.965 --> 20:23.229
Unfortunately. the shot's too tight.

20:23.300 --> 20:27.737
I got make. model and color.
but the plates are phony.

20:27.805 --> 20:30.638
- Order satellite coverage on this sector.
- It's done.

20:30.708 --> 20:33.302
See you later then.

20:33.377 --> 20:36.904
- That's all we can get at this point?
- Squeeze me at this point.

20:36.981 --> 20:38.141
I'm doing the best I can.

20:52.129 --> 20:55.929
- You planning a quick getaway?
- Yeah, ever since I met you.

21:06.944 --> 21:09.742
{cat mews)

21:19.623 --> 21:23.525
I hate to see the chicken
that lives in this coop.

21:23.594 --> 21:27.997
This is where I work. May seem strange,
but it's been my office for 15 years.

21:28.065 --> 21:33.594
It's completely secure. Copper wire mesh
keeps the radio signals out.

21:37.074 --> 21:40.635
The satellite imagery
of the convenience store 20 minutes ago.

21:40.711 --> 21:42.508
They're in an El Camino.

21:45.816 --> 21:47.215
There it is.

21:47.284 --> 21:51.414
John, give us LAT 30, 64
minutes, LONG 72, 29 minutes.

21:53.524 --> 21:55.583
{Reynolds) There they are.

21:55.659 --> 21:58.059
Coming in from top left.

22:00.431 --> 22:02.524
Let's go in there and get them.

22:06.170 --> 22:10.072
{Brill) I call it the jar.
No phone or utility lines coming in.

22:10.140 --> 22:12.938
Self-contained.
Unplugged from the world.

22:13.010 --> 22:15.570
Nothing for a wire bug
to piggyback in on.

22:15.646 --> 22:19.878
That leaves only transmitters.
It's easy enough to signal-sweep for those.

22:19.950 --> 22:23.852
Signal-sweeping for transmitters.
You're just a party animal.

22:25.789 --> 22:28.815
The government's been in bed with
the telecommunications industry

22:28.892 --> 22:32.089
since the '40s.
They've infected everything.

22:32.162 --> 22:36.861
They can get into your bank statements,
your computer files, E-mail,

22:36.934 --> 22:38.265
Iisten to your phone calls.

22:38.335 --> 22:43.034
- My wife's been saying that for years.
- Every wire, every airwave.

22:43.107 --> 22:48.306
The more technology you use, the easier it
is for them to keep tabs on you.

22:48.379 --> 22:52.839
It's a brave new world out there.
At least it better be.

23:09.533 --> 23:13.936
There it goes.
It's some kind of simple encryption.

23:14.772 --> 23:17.434
Oh, conspiracy theorists
of the world, unite.

23:17.508 --> 23:20.636
It's more than a theory with me.
I'm a former conspirer.

23:22.012 --> 23:26.005
I used to work for the NSA
I was a communication analyst.

23:26.083 --> 23:28.517
Listen to international calls,
foreign nationalists.

23:28.585 --> 23:31.918
That G.P.S. tracking device we found
in your cellular telephone?

23:31.989 --> 23:35.049
I designed one of the first models
in that series.

23:42.499 --> 23:47.869
Fort Meade has 18 acres of mainframe
computers underground.

23:47.938 --> 23:52.341
You're talking on the phone and you use
the word, "bomb," "president," "Allah,"

23:52.409 --> 23:55.503
any of a hundred key words,
the computer recognizes it,

23:55.579 --> 23:59.071
automatically records it, red flags it for
analysis; that was 20 years ago.

24:05.956 --> 24:08.322
The Hubble Telescope
that looks up to the stars?

24:08.392 --> 24:12.852
They've got over a hundred spy satellites
looking down at us. That's classified.

24:12.930 --> 24:16.161
In the old days, we actually had to tap
a wire into your phone line.

24:16.233 --> 24:19.498
Now calls bouncin' off satellites -
they snatch 'em out of the air.

24:23.307 --> 24:24.501
What's this?

24:30.481 --> 24:33.416
- {Dean) That's Phil Hamersly.
- Jesus Christ.

24:37.788 --> 24:38.777
{sighs)

24:42.159 --> 24:45.754
Who's this guy?
I'm gonna check the executive NSA files.

24:45.829 --> 24:47.763
Let's run the photo l.D. on him.

24:59.343 --> 25:02.506
Reynolds, Thomas Brian.
Born 9-11-40.

25:02.579 --> 25:06.276
Attended Episcopal School, D.C.
B.A., Harvard, PhD, Princeton.

25:06.350 --> 25:09.046
On loan from the State Department
since '95.

25:09.620 --> 25:11.713
He's not a professional.
He's a politician.

25:12.623 --> 25:14.921
{beeping)

25:16.059 --> 25:18.994
Aw, shit! Take that.

25:19.930 --> 25:22.057
When's the last time you
contacted somebody?

25:22.132 --> 25:23.190
When we stopped.

25:23.267 --> 25:26.395
- I told you not to use a phone.
- I called from a pay phone.

25:26.470 --> 25:29.962
- What did I tell you?
- You told me no calls.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.531
I told you no calls.

25:32.609 --> 25:36.636
- Get the cat.
- Get the cat. Hey, man...

25:36.713 --> 25:38.977
- What's the cat's name?
- Babe.

25:39.049 --> 25:43.247
Come here, Baby. Come here, Baby.
Baby, come, come. Come here!

25:49.026 --> 25:50.084
{snarling)

25:50.160 --> 25:51.491
Shit!

25:55.866 --> 25:56.958
Goddamn it.

26:08.111 --> 26:09.772
All right, baby, what do we got?

26:13.183 --> 26:15.777
What the...?

26:17.521 --> 26:18.783
{meows)

26:18.855 --> 26:20.823
{beeping)

26:23.727 --> 26:27.959
- Subjects exiting.
- Williams, get the hell out of there!

26:28.031 --> 26:30.864
This place is gonna blow!
Go, go, go!

26:39.543 --> 26:41.238
{meows)

26:49.386 --> 26:52.184
Come on! Go!

26:56.059 --> 26:57.822
Move! Move! Move!

27:06.103 --> 27:08.003
Move! Move!

27:18.715 --> 27:20.808
- What is happening?
- I blew up the building.

27:20.884 --> 27:23.250
- Why?
- Because you made a phone call!

27:33.964 --> 27:36.831
- Tell him to pull over!
- Pull the vehicle over now!

27:49.646 --> 27:51.113
Pull over now!

28:07.497 --> 28:09.158
Pump action!

28:27.284 --> 28:28.478
Gosh damn!

28:33.390 --> 28:35.483
Fuel line must be broken.

28:36.793 --> 28:39.785
- Get it out! Goddamn!
- Stop the car!

28:43.367 --> 28:45.858
{yelling)

28:51.508 --> 28:54.136
- Where's the disk?
- Shit!

28:54.211 --> 28:56.645
No! Shit!

28:57.381 --> 28:59.941
- Is there any way to save it?
- Ah, that's ruined.

29:00.016 --> 29:02.576
- What do we do?
- I'm leaving.

29:02.652 --> 29:04.483
Subjects heading west across
the coal fields.

29:04.554 --> 29:06.613
- You're leaving?
- The disk is gone.

29:06.690 --> 29:08.817
We've got nothing. It's over.

29:21.071 --> 29:25.337
{from helicopter) We have control.
Put down your weapons.

29:31.915 --> 29:33.246
You think I wanted that disk?

29:33.316 --> 29:35.648
You think I wanted that idiot to put
that goddamn...

29:35.719 --> 29:38.449
Who gives a fuck what you wanted?

29:38.522 --> 29:42.549
Since you've shown up, Rachel's dead
and the NSA's onto me.

29:44.761 --> 29:48.356
Onto you? What do you mean onto you?
Onto you about what?

29:48.432 --> 29:50.696
You're not the target. I am.

30:02.446 --> 30:05.347
We got him.
He's right in front of us.

30:05.415 --> 30:07.383
{train whistle)

30:08.151 --> 30:10.551
Come on, come on.

30:11.888 --> 30:13.651
We got him.
He's got nowhere to go.

30:25.635 --> 30:28.331
Air One to ground. they're somewhere
between the trains.

30:29.473 --> 30:30.770
Get the fuck away from me.

30:33.510 --> 30:35.205
Dammit!

30:35.846 --> 30:37.279
We're coming back around.

30:37.347 --> 30:40.373
- You're blowing my whole life.
- What life?

30:40.450 --> 30:42.975
You live in a fucking jar
so the world can't touch you.

30:43.053 --> 30:45.419
And you didn't give
a shit about Rachel!

30:45.489 --> 30:49.050
Just some package
under seat number 32 to you.

30:50.827 --> 30:52.522
- Come on!
- Do you have a problem?

30:52.596 --> 30:54.826
Do it! Go on, do it!

30:55.966 --> 30:59.333
I'm all you've got!
And you're all I've got.

31:07.277 --> 31:09.302
Got 'em. Heading towards the freeway.

31:16.686 --> 31:19.246
{driver honks horn)

31:20.557 --> 31:23.151
- Get out of the fucking car!
- All right.

31:23.226 --> 31:25.126
- Come on. Get out.
- All right.

31:25.195 --> 31:27.720
- Don't do this to me.
- Tell your story walking.

31:28.465 --> 31:29.955
Hey, wait a minute. Don't...

31:30.734 --> 31:33.669
Thanks for your help back at the train.

31:36.039 --> 31:37.631
Oh, Jesus!

31:37.707 --> 31:39.902
Air One to ground. I think we lost them.

31:39.976 --> 31:42.501
They're somewhere beneath
the overpass.

31:44.381 --> 31:45.370
{meows)

31:51.621 --> 31:55.318
Well, you certainly carjacked
a really nice car.

31:55.392 --> 31:58.793
This is a piece of shit.
What are you talking about?

31:58.862 --> 32:03.196
{sighs) I need sugar, you know.
I'm getting cranky.

32:03.934 --> 32:05.925
Getting?

32:06.002 --> 32:09.460
I'm hypoglycemic. My body can't
metabolize the sugar, so...

32:09.539 --> 32:12.372
So you're a pain in the ass
when you don't eat.

32:12.442 --> 32:14.740
Basically.

32:14.811 --> 32:16.938
Yeah. Right.

32:17.013 --> 32:20.073
- We should eat then.
- Let's do that.

32:21.217 --> 32:22.616
{Hicks) His real name is Edward Lyle.

32:22.686 --> 32:26.713
Graduated from Drexel University.
Enlisted in the army, 1953.

32:26.790 --> 32:29.452
Rapid promotion, excelled at intelligence
and communications.

32:29.526 --> 32:33.792
- Joined NSA in '65.
- Of course.

32:33.863 --> 32:37.128
He was in the agency till 1980
when he vanished and went underground.

32:37.200 --> 32:40.727
- Hasn't been seen since.
- That's a long time.

32:40.804 --> 32:43.466
Lots of black bags, lots of deleteds.

32:43.540 --> 32:46.634
He's familiar with explosives, obviously.

32:46.710 --> 32:50.407
His last assignment, he went into lran,
late '78, after the Shah.

32:50.480 --> 32:54.576
This is our problem.
This man.

32:56.686 --> 33:01.123
So, we were helping the secret police
supply weapons

33:01.191 --> 33:03.318
to the Afghani rebels fighting the Soviets.

33:03.393 --> 33:05.384
My partner and I were on
the eastern border

33:05.462 --> 33:09.626
monitoring Soviet military transmissions.
It was kind of fun, actually.

33:09.699 --> 33:12.190
I liked the lranians.

33:12.268 --> 33:14.793
Back in Tehran, the hard-liners
seized the embassy,

33:14.871 --> 33:17.863
and overnight, the whole country changed.

33:17.941 --> 33:21.468
People we'd been working with,
they turned on us. I got out.

33:21.544 --> 33:24.479
My partner didn't.
By the time I got home,

33:24.547 --> 33:27.675
the whole mission had become
a press disaster waiting to happen.

33:27.751 --> 33:30.447
Aiding and abetting the new enemy..

33:30.520 --> 33:34.684
The agency conveniently forgot I existed.

33:34.758 --> 33:39.559
I don't blame them.
It's what they had to do.

33:39.629 --> 33:42.860
I loved the agency.

33:42.932 --> 33:46.265
I loved the work.
I loved the people.

33:46.336 --> 33:47.735
It was my whole life.

33:49.606 --> 33:51.733
Your partner was Rachel's father.

33:51.808 --> 33:56.336
Yeah. The idea was...

33:56.413 --> 33:58.938
The idea always was that if one
of us got out,

33:59.015 --> 34:02.712
he'd take care of the other's family.
Rachel was all he had.

34:02.786 --> 34:05.118
So she became my promise to him.

34:05.188 --> 34:08.179
- {woman) Here you go, hon.
- Thank you.

34:12.795 --> 34:14.991
Maybe we can still keep
that promise in a way.

34:15.065 --> 34:17.659
You're a threat now, just like I was.

34:17.734 --> 34:20.065
Threat to whom? To them?

34:21.004 --> 34:23.768
To your family, friends,
everyone you know and meet.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.308
That's why I went away
and didn't come back.

34:26.376 --> 34:28.435
You gotta go away, Robert.

34:28.511 --> 34:31.446
No, I don't think so.
This is my life.

34:31.514 --> 34:33.777
I worked hard for it,
and I want it back.

34:33.850 --> 34:36.648
I grew up without a father.
I know what that is.

34:36.719 --> 34:39.484
And I will not allow
my family to go through that.

34:40.356 --> 34:44.520
{child) Mommy, I don't wanna go home.

34:50.967 --> 34:52.958
Wanna take a poke at me?

34:53.036 --> 34:55.937
- Come on.
- I don't hit senior citizens.

34:58.308 --> 35:01.141
- Oh, come here, Babe.
- {meows)

35:01.211 --> 35:03.441
Hey! Come up here. Come on.

35:03.513 --> 35:07.609
In guerrilla warfare, you try to use
your weaknesses as strengths.

35:07.684 --> 35:11.552
- Such as?
- Well, if they're big and you're small,

35:11.621 --> 35:17.890
then you're mobile and they're slow.
You're hidden and they're exposed.

35:18.628 --> 35:23.292
Only fight battles you know you can win.
That's the way the Vietcong did it.

35:23.566 --> 35:26.558
You capture their weapons and you use
them against them the next time.

35:26.636 --> 35:30.436
That way they're supplying you.
You grow stronger as they grow weaker.

35:31.941 --> 35:34.739
- Hey, try these.
- Can I have something else, please?

35:34.811 --> 35:38.247
- Y eah. Here.
- Never mind.

35:39.349 --> 35:43.251
- That's my best aloha shirt.
- Well, say "aloha" to it.

35:52.996 --> 35:56.955
You want a cookie,
an apple or the pretzels?

35:57.033 --> 35:58.022
Cookie.

36:00.170 --> 36:04.231
- You want the apple or the pretzels?
- The cookie.

36:09.679 --> 36:14.673
- Do you have any kids?
- Yep. A boy, Eric. He's eight.

36:14.751 --> 36:17.447
What do you know about locking on to
cellular phone signals?

36:17.520 --> 36:21.422
Well, generally I just push "send"
and hope.

36:23.660 --> 36:26.060
Great. You're gonna be a big help.

36:27.297 --> 36:30.095
- How's the cookie?
- It's real good.

36:32.335 --> 36:34.030
- Steve, how you doing?
- Howdy.

36:34.103 --> 36:36.196
- Need some gear.
- Help yourself.

36:36.272 --> 36:39.469
- Say hi to Bill.
- How you doing, Bill?

36:41.077 --> 36:43.307
Where's the two gigahertz
video transmitters?

36:43.379 --> 36:46.007
Right behind you, second shelf.

36:46.082 --> 36:48.607
Steve? I thought you said
his name was Bill.

36:48.685 --> 36:50.482
No. You're Bill.

36:50.553 --> 36:54.649
- If I'm Bill, let me know I'm Bill.
- I just did.

36:54.724 --> 36:57.716
{over TV)...the president has not
committed himself.

36:57.794 --> 37:02.163
but he does recognize that we do need
something in this area.

37:02.232 --> 37:05.065
And I think he will come to see
that this bill will. in the end.

37:05.134 --> 37:08.626
provide the kind of security that this...

37:08.705 --> 37:12.038
- What security?
- The kind of security he's gonna need.

37:16.512 --> 37:17.672
{Brill) Ah, here we go.

37:17.747 --> 37:21.444
Modified cell phone interfaced with
laptop computer.

37:21.517 --> 37:24.850
- Creates an enormously powerful tool.
- What is that?

37:24.921 --> 37:29.620
This is Congressman Albert's
home address and his cellular ESN.

37:29.692 --> 37:35.892
Now, we reprogram our phone
with Congressman Albert's ESN,

37:35.965 --> 37:37.557
and you know what we got?

37:37.634 --> 37:40.159
{Albert) Hi. sweetie. We just landed.
So. how are the kids?

37:40.236 --> 37:42.363
- {woman) Melissa has a fever.
- She OK?

37:42.438 --> 37:44.770
She's fine. When will you have
some time to talk?

37:44.841 --> 37:48.572
About 30. 40 minutes.
I'll be in suite 59. Lincoln Hotel.

37:48.645 --> 37:51.011
- You're a dangerous man.
- Ha-ha-ha.

37:51.648 --> 37:52.637
Aw,shit.

37:57.553 --> 37:58.542
Shit.

38:13.036 --> 38:15.231
- {whispers) Say something.
- Excuse me?

38:15.305 --> 38:17.637
- Louder.
- What are you talking about?

38:17.707 --> 38:18.696
That's good.

38:21.377 --> 38:23.811
- Won't they look in there?
- That's the idea.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.075
Great plan.

38:27.617 --> 38:32.520
I've been law-abiding my whole life.
One day with you, I'm shooting...

38:32.588 --> 38:35.557
And breaking...
I have to go to the bathroom.

38:36.893 --> 38:39.623
- {aide) Rest well.
- {Albert) Thanks. Bye.

38:41.497 --> 38:43.328
Good work. guys.

38:45.234 --> 38:48.226
So, how does one stumble
into your line of work?

38:48.304 --> 38:52.934
When I was 12,
my dad had a grocery store.

38:53.009 --> 38:55.375
Had a partner he thought
was stealing from him,

38:55.445 --> 38:57.606
so I figured out a way to tap the phone.

38:57.680 --> 39:00.513
I loved listening to this guy
and him not knowing I was there,

39:00.583 --> 39:02.847
- like I was invisible.
- So was he stealing?

39:02.919 --> 39:04.250
Yeah.

39:04.854 --> 39:06.651
{knocks on door)

39:09.325 --> 39:11.350
Hm.

39:20.069 --> 39:22.537
- We got him.
- {woman sighs)

39:22.605 --> 39:26.473
Yeah, go for it, Mr. Congressman.

39:34.951 --> 39:38.352
There's our hard-earned
tax dollars at work.

39:41.858 --> 39:42.984
God bless America.

39:47.230 --> 39:50.859
- You're too young to watch this part here.
- Yeah, so is she.

39:52.468 --> 39:56.461
{moans)

40:00.710 --> 40:02.610
{sighs)

40:02.678 --> 40:05.272
What's the matter?

40:05.348 --> 40:08.647
I was just thinkin', what if someone
was watching me like that?

40:10.787 --> 40:12.482
Now you know how Pintero felt.

40:16.192 --> 40:18.456
{sighs)

40:26.869 --> 40:29.429
Yeah, could you send somebody
up to my room, please?

40:29.505 --> 40:31.996
Yes, this is Christa,
the congressman's aide.

40:32.075 --> 40:33.975
{men chattering)

40:34.043 --> 40:35.305
How should I knowwhat it is?

40:35.378 --> 40:38.347
I'm just a congressman,
for chrissake.

40:38.414 --> 40:43.477
Security expert tells me
it's like a PX-73 burst transmitter,

40:43.553 --> 40:46.989
whatever the hell that is.
Except it's much more sophisticated.

40:47.056 --> 40:50.890
Of course I'm going to send it down.
That's... That's not the...

40:52.128 --> 40:54.528
Because I want to know
who in the hell put it there, Jim.

40:59.135 --> 41:01.797
{knock on door)

41:06.576 --> 41:08.908
- Hi there.
- Hola. Si?

41:13.950 --> 41:16.350
La electricidad? Oh. si.

41:16.419 --> 41:19.081
{explaining in Spanish)

41:19.155 --> 41:22.488
Oh. {continues in Spanish)

41:26.996 --> 41:28.520
Gracias. Señorita.

41:51.420 --> 41:54.787
- Hi there.
- Hello.

42:32.995 --> 42:35.896
- {baby crying on TV)
- {host) The category. Barbara.

42:35.965 --> 42:39.264
This is very irritating.
Get one channel and stay with it.

42:39.335 --> 42:41.803
{changes channel)

42:41.871 --> 42:44.931
- Stop jumping!
- We're on TV!

42:45.007 --> 42:48.204
- Stop jumping around.
- We're on TV!

43:04.594 --> 43:07.495
OK, these are the ones
they wanted us to find.

43:08.464 --> 43:14.198
- They're all ours. We made 'em.
- You think this is fucking amusing?

43:15.338 --> 43:17.203
Thomas, could I see you a second?

43:23.079 --> 43:27.345
Look, there's $140,000 here.
I have no idea where it came from.

43:27.416 --> 43:29.509
What are you talking about?
An extra 140?

43:29.585 --> 43:31.519
Yeah.

43:31.587 --> 43:33.953
Look, it's right here.

43:34.023 --> 43:37.220
Two separate $70,000 deposits
on the same day.

43:37.293 --> 43:41.127
Yes, I see the deposits, thank you.
I have no idea where they came from.

43:41.197 --> 43:44.223
Tom. I'm sorry.

43:44.300 --> 43:47.394
That was Shaffer. He wants to see
all department heads at 0800.

43:49.939 --> 43:52.407
You're going in on Sunday.

43:52.475 --> 43:56.536
- That's just great.
- Emily.

43:56.612 --> 43:58.876
This is your separate account.
I have no idea...

43:58.948 --> 44:02.748
By the way, who is Christa?

44:04.153 --> 44:05.711
"Eternally yours"?

44:09.558 --> 44:11.890
{Shaffer) I want the entire history
of this device,

44:11.961 --> 44:15.397
from birth to abortion,
on my desk in two hours.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.297
I want the name
of the tech who made it.

44:23.339 --> 44:27.036
I want to know who authorized its use,

44:27.109 --> 44:29.839
who checked it out from inventory,

44:29.912 --> 44:31.607
and for what purpose.

44:35.284 --> 44:38.617
Most important,
how on God's green Earth

44:38.688 --> 44:41.851
it got into Congressman Albert's
hotel room.

44:41.924 --> 44:44.757
Listen, people, everyone here knows
where this is going.

44:44.827 --> 44:49.423
Now, if this was a legit op...

44:53.369 --> 44:55.633
If this was a legit op,

44:55.705 --> 44:59.641
and I can't possibly see
how it could be, then so be it.

45:01.877 --> 45:06.814
But if this was somebody's
unilateral wet dream,

45:06.882 --> 45:09.316
then that somebody is going to prison.

45:11.687 --> 45:13.416
It's him.

45:16.292 --> 45:19.022
- Yes?
- {Brill) Thomas Reynolds?

45:19.095 --> 45:20.084
Who is this?

45:20.162 --> 45:23.029
I have that environmental study
you've been looking for.

45:25.301 --> 45:29.328
- Can we discuss this in person?
- Be at the corner of lowa and 3rd at 3:00.

45:30.139 --> 45:31.231
I'll be there at four.

45:31.307 --> 45:34.401
{hangs up. dial tone)

45:34.477 --> 45:36.138
We need a confession out of this guy.

45:36.212 --> 45:40.376
We have to get it on tape,
and we have to get it fast, OK?

45:42.752 --> 45:47.121
Oh, you shouldn't have.
This thing must've cost 12, 13 bucks easy.

45:47.189 --> 45:49.680
Now, they expect me
to be wired, all right?

45:49.759 --> 45:52.023
So what they'll do is they'll sweep me.

45:52.094 --> 45:55.552
But once they're done,
I'm gonna give you the signal,

45:55.631 --> 45:57.462
and you turn the mic on.

45:57.533 --> 46:00.400
- What's the signal?
- Putting gum in my mouth.

46:01.270 --> 46:05.934
So after the signal, you turn the mike on.
Turn it on now. Let's try it.

46:06.008 --> 46:07.839
- {high-pitched squeal)
- OK, off.

46:07.910 --> 46:09.377
- {turns it off)
- Good.

46:09.445 --> 46:14.712
To be safe, they'll try to scan all
the frequencies to try to track you down.

46:14.784 --> 46:16.945
If these guys are good,
and they're very good,

46:17.019 --> 46:20.284
in a location like this, they'll have you
in five, six minutes.

46:20.356 --> 46:24.383
So in four minutes time,
after you turn that tape on,

46:24.460 --> 46:27.952
regardless of what's happening,
you get out that door. You got that?

46:29.064 --> 46:31.931
- No.
- {sighs)

46:41.310 --> 46:42.777
{siren)

46:45.281 --> 46:48.648
Record. On-off.

46:48.717 --> 46:51.652
All right, let the games begin.

46:53.456 --> 46:55.219
Hey there.

46:57.860 --> 47:01.421
Edward Lyle. Policeman.

47:01.497 --> 47:04.591
- Very clever.
- Why don't you call your friends over.

47:05.968 --> 47:06.957
Pratt.

47:13.576 --> 47:16.773
Step towards the fence for me.
This won't take a second.

47:16.846 --> 47:19.713
{electronic humming)

47:22.952 --> 47:24.044
He's clear, sir.

47:25.888 --> 47:27.913
{Reynolds) So. do you have the tape?

47:28.491 --> 47:32.018
- {Brill) Yes, I have.
- Here?

47:32.094 --> 47:34.562
- No.
- Then what is there to talk about?

47:34.630 --> 47:36.928
- Money.
- Money?

47:36.999 --> 47:41.265
I was wondering why I hadn't seen it on
CNN. Have you looked at the tape?

47:43.138 --> 47:46.369
- What's on it?
- Your ugly-ass face is on it.

47:47.209 --> 47:50.508
It shows the death
of Congressman Hamersly.

47:50.579 --> 47:52.979
The needle behind the ear.

47:53.048 --> 47:56.108
- Three faces, readily identifiable.
- How much you want for it?

47:56.185 --> 47:59.552
- $1.8 million.
- What?

47:59.622 --> 48:02.090
And my file cleared.
I want my life back.

48:02.157 --> 48:06.093
My 1980 salary with cost
of living increases for the past 18 years.

48:06.161 --> 48:07.753
- Plus interest.
- Oh, shit.

48:07.830 --> 48:11.789
Plus the retirement package
for executive level, E-16. Comes to 1.85.

48:11.867 --> 48:16.065
- I rounded it down.
- And for this, I get the tape and Mr. Dean.

48:16.138 --> 48:19.301
- Actually, it's Dean that has the tape.
- Aw, shit.

48:19.375 --> 48:23.004
- What does he want?
- He wants to know why you killed the girl.

48:23.078 --> 48:24.807
What girl you talking about?

48:24.880 --> 48:27.906
I tried to explain it to him,
but I couldn't figure it out.

48:27.983 --> 48:31.009
You're getting self-righteous on me?
I've seen your file.

48:31.086 --> 48:33.953
- Not exactly a beacon of light.
- Yeah, I agree.

48:34.023 --> 48:37.356
It's just that...
You kill Hamersly, OK.

48:37.426 --> 48:39.621
I wouldn't have, but I understand
the argument.

48:39.695 --> 48:41.526
But why the girl?

48:41.597 --> 48:43.861
Just to get to some schmuck that barely
knows you're after him?

48:43.933 --> 48:46.424
- Schmuck?
- We never dealt with domestic.

48:46.502 --> 48:49.096
- With us. it was always war.
- You won the war.

48:49.171 --> 48:51.696
Now we're fighting the peace.
It's more volatile.

48:51.774 --> 48:54.834
- Does he take this long doing everything?
- {mews)

48:54.910 --> 48:57.208
Now we've got ten million crackpots
out there

48:57.279 --> 48:59.474
with sniper scopes,
saran gas and C-4.

48:59.548 --> 49:03.609
Ten-year-olds go on the net, downloading
encryption we can barely break,

49:03.686 --> 49:07.315
not to mention instructions on how to
make a low-yield nuclear device.

49:07.389 --> 49:10.790
Privacy's been dead
for 30 years because we can't risk it.

49:10.859 --> 49:14.351
The privacy that's left is the inside of
your head. Maybe that's enough.

49:14.430 --> 49:18.059
- Get him to say something.
- We've located subject. Keep him talking.

49:18.133 --> 49:23.196
You think we're the enemy of democracy,
you and l? We're democracy's last hope.

49:23.272 --> 49:26.366
- There'll always be power.
- You shouldn't be there, get out.

49:26.442 --> 49:29.900
They're on to us.
Get out and follow procedure.

49:32.281 --> 49:34.215
Get out now, Robert.
Get out!

49:39.648 --> 49:41.809
{horn honking)

49:51.827 --> 49:53.454
You gonna shoot a policeman?

49:53.528 --> 49:55.996
- You wouldn't get a block.
- Get in.

49:59.501 --> 50:00.593
{phone ringing)

50:01.436 --> 50:02.926
- Yeah?
- {woman) Tom?

50:03.005 --> 50:05.530
- Emily, what is it?
- Our Visa card's been canceled...

50:05.607 --> 50:08.633
- Did you try the American Express?
- Yeah. I tried that too.

50:08.710 --> 50:12.510
- I can't deal with this. I'll call you back.
- Listen. I... No. Tom...

50:12.581 --> 50:17.575
Credit cards not working? Yeah, that can
be a real pain in the ass, can't it?

50:26.695 --> 50:28.890
Come in.

50:32.401 --> 50:34.266
- Asshole.
- Great plan.

50:41.943 --> 50:43.342
Tell him to give me the tape.

50:43.412 --> 50:46.210
{laughing)

50:46.281 --> 50:48.249
- What guarantees do we have if...?
- None.

50:50.419 --> 50:52.478
{Brill) None?

50:52.554 --> 50:56.456
Does everybody here know that you killed
Phil Hamersly and Rachel Banks?

50:56.525 --> 50:59.892
This guy is going down, and he's gonna
take all of you with him.

50:59.961 --> 51:01.792
Trust me on this.

51:01.863 --> 51:05.560
Aah! Goddamn!
Oh, you son of a bitch!

51:05.634 --> 51:08.535
Rachel Banks is not the issue.
Hamersly is.

51:08.603 --> 51:10.730
He was killed for a purpose.
Where's the tape?

51:12.441 --> 51:15.171
{groaning) Oh, shit.

51:15.243 --> 51:17.837
Where's the tape?

51:19.614 --> 51:20.740
- Tom!
- {cocking gun)

51:21.249 --> 51:23.012
All right.
I'll give it to you.

51:23.085 --> 51:24.712
Thank you.

51:25.320 --> 51:28.346
What are you doing, you moron?
That's our only leverage!

51:28.423 --> 51:32.257
- For chrissake.
- I'm the moron? Me?

51:32.327 --> 51:34.318
- No, you're the moron!
- Where is it?

51:34.396 --> 51:37.661
- Washington and Fourth.
- Washington and Fourth.

51:37.732 --> 51:39.996
{horn honking)

51:45.240 --> 51:47.640
- That's my blender.
- So?

51:48.810 --> 51:50.209
Fourth and Washington.

51:57.319 --> 51:59.685
- Where is it?
- The restaurant.

51:59.754 --> 52:03.554
11169 Fourth Street.
Stand by to enter.

52:15.170 --> 52:17.161
Wait a second.

52:18.707 --> 52:24.373
- See if you can get the plate on that van.
- T-S-1-8-7-8-5.

52:24.446 --> 52:28.974
- You go in with Pratt and bring it out.
- I don't think so.

52:31.019 --> 52:32.646
Oh, you don't think so?

52:32.721 --> 52:36.555
If I go in there and I bring
that tape out, I'm a dead man.

52:37.392 --> 52:40.623
We go together, you and me.
You view the tape, you sign off on it.

52:40.695 --> 52:43.994
They let Brill go, you take the tape home,
everyone has a Merry Christmas.

52:45.534 --> 52:48.401
What assurances do I have that you
haven't copied that tape?

52:49.671 --> 52:51.104
You think I want copies?

52:51.173 --> 52:53.107
That tape has been
the bane of my existence.

52:53.175 --> 52:56.804
I wish the one that we have
was at the bottom of the Chesapeake.

52:56.878 --> 52:59.403
I wanna go home.

53:05.554 --> 53:08.318
- Give me a piece.
- Yes, sir.

53:10.525 --> 53:13.221
All right, you and me.

53:15.063 --> 53:17.725
And Pratt and Bingham.

53:18.800 --> 53:22.167
Fiedler, get one of those
little cameras on Bingham.

53:29.044 --> 53:32.502
Guess what.
It's a government vehicle. Shit!

53:32.581 --> 53:35.846
I'm going in cold.
If I need you, Hicks will call it.

53:40.689 --> 53:42.554
You guys got some food in here?

53:42.624 --> 53:44.819
Oh, behind you.

53:56.071 --> 54:00.235
{whispers) You're either incredibly smart
or incredibly stupid.

54:00.976 --> 54:04.935
We'll see in a minute.
Watch out for the FBl.

54:12.387 --> 54:17.120
- I'll be back to get my blender.
- I'll have it gift wrapped.

54:19.928 --> 54:21.589
It's your show.

54:22.998 --> 54:26.434
- lsn't that the guy that was here last time?
- {woman) You're right.

54:35.510 --> 54:37.000
No, no. Thank you.

54:37.078 --> 54:39.205
- You guys like the food?
- Yeah. It's good food.

54:39.281 --> 54:43.274
- It's good food, huh? I made it.
- Yeah, yeah, sure you made it.

54:43.985 --> 54:46.783
- {Pintero) Come on. Eat your food.
- I am.

54:46.855 --> 54:48.789
Black guy's back with a couple creeps.

54:48.857 --> 54:50.620
Yeah, show him in.

54:57.565 --> 55:00.932
{Pintero) Hey, how you doing?

55:01.002 --> 55:04.802
- What's this, the FBl?
- No, sir, Mr. Pintero.

55:04.873 --> 55:06.773
This is the gentleman
you wanted to meet.

55:06.841 --> 55:09.435
- Oh, that's him?
- Yep, that's him.

55:09.511 --> 55:12.878
- So you made the tape?
- What?

55:12.947 --> 55:19.284
- Did you make the videotape?
- Look, he wants it back.

55:19.354 --> 55:23.051
Really? I don't give
a shit what he wants.

55:25.493 --> 55:28.485
Could we have some privacy, please?

55:29.698 --> 55:31.188
Yeah, maybe we should.

55:32.967 --> 55:35.993
- Get the kids out of here.
- Come on, boys.

55:38.006 --> 55:40.133
Get 'em out of here.
Go on.

55:40.208 --> 55:44.269
Maria. Come on! Uncle Paulie
will take you to the zoo later.

55:44.346 --> 55:46.780
{coughing. choking)

55:46.848 --> 55:50.306
- Ooh, ooh, Hicks.
- What the hell's the matter with him?

55:50.385 --> 55:53.354
No, not on the equipment.
We gotta get him... OK.

55:57.158 --> 55:59.854
{vomiting)

56:02.597 --> 56:04.792
Check this out. Come here.

56:06.167 --> 56:08.101
{woman) Tony, they just pulled
a guy out of the van.

56:08.169 --> 56:11.570
He's puking and bleeding
all over himself.

56:14.342 --> 56:15.934
Shit. It's a city cop.

56:16.010 --> 56:18.069
{meows)

56:18.146 --> 56:20.114
Hey, Babe.

56:22.250 --> 56:23.945
Oh, yeah. OK.

56:24.018 --> 56:26.851
He's your friend.
Persuade him to give us the tape.

56:26.921 --> 56:31.688
Hey, look. Number one:
He's not my friend.

56:31.760 --> 56:35.127
- And number two: It's not his tape.
- Whose is it?

56:35.196 --> 56:38.222
It's mine, OK? It's mine.
I bought it.

56:38.299 --> 56:40.961
You sold it to him?

56:44.439 --> 56:46.236
Now, you listen to me.

56:49.544 --> 56:52.741
Who are you?
What the fuck you trying to do to me?

56:52.814 --> 56:55.749
- Oh, this looks bad.
- I'm with the federal government.

56:55.817 --> 56:57.808
The federal government
made a videotape?

56:57.886 --> 57:00.855
- You guys oughta get in there.
- Wait a minute. Listen.

57:00.922 --> 57:04.585
Now, we can go get a warrant and come
back with the FBl, take anything we want,

57:04.659 --> 57:07.890
arrest anybody that we want -
just give the man the videotape.

57:07.962 --> 57:10.863
Only one who'll get arrested is you,
for felonious cocksucking

57:10.932 --> 57:13.594
with an attempt to swallow the evidence.
So shut your mouth.

57:13.668 --> 57:15.932
And you, get the fuck out of here.

57:16.004 --> 57:18.564
Go get your warrant.
Until then, get out of my joint.

57:18.640 --> 57:21.973
You gotta get in there! They're gonna be
dead bodies all over the place!

57:22.043 --> 57:24.671
- Shut up!
- Get in there!

57:24.746 --> 57:27.874
- OK, let's go.
- This is it. This is it.

57:27.949 --> 57:30.918
Krug, take the rear.
Jones, you're in the side entrance.

57:32.153 --> 57:34.280
What are we waiting for?
Come on, let's go!

57:34.355 --> 57:37.051
No. Tony says we wait
until they show up.

57:37.125 --> 57:39.423
- Put the guns away.
- You put your guns away.

57:40.061 --> 57:42.154
Put it away. Put it away.

57:42.831 --> 57:44.696
{door opens)

57:47.302 --> 57:48.769
Put it away.
Put it away.

57:54.676 --> 57:57.440
All right, I'm putting it away.

58:01.783 --> 58:04.650
Now, what will it take
for us to get that videotape?

58:04.719 --> 58:07.449
The end of the world.

58:10.191 --> 58:13.649
Let's go. We're leaving.
Put the guns down now.

58:13.728 --> 58:16.094
- Drop your weapons!
- No!

58:48.563 --> 58:49.996
Go! Go! Go!

58:50.064 --> 58:53.864
{sirens)

58:58.373 --> 59:01.399
- Get your hands up.
- You get your hands up! Drop the gun!

59:01.476 --> 59:04.274
- On your knees.
- Easy with this guy. He's not one of them.

59:04.345 --> 59:07.280
Easy, easy. Get up.
Come on.

59:07.348 --> 59:11.307
- Let's get this place cleaned up.
- Not too stupid after all.

59:11.386 --> 59:13.820
Let's go.
Let's move it. Come on.

59:14.956 --> 59:17.686
Right there.
Somebody get the paramedics.

59:17.759 --> 59:20.557
We need paramedics.
We have 13 bodies in here. Let's go.

59:32.974 --> 59:37.070
All right, listen up. Get some l.D.s on these
guys. Get these guns out of here.

01:00:06.441 --> 01:00:09.069
Excuse me, there was a guy in here
in cop uniform.

01:00:09.143 --> 01:00:11.008
- The guy with the bloody hand?
- Yes.

01:00:11.079 --> 01:00:13.104
Yeah, we have him on
surveillance tape.

01:00:13.181 --> 01:00:15.240
Russ, would you run that back for me?

01:00:16.784 --> 01:00:19.776
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up.
There he is.

01:00:19.854 --> 01:00:24.951
He's headed south on Washington.
Is that a cat under his arm?

01:00:27.595 --> 01:00:30.621
All right, thank you.

01:00:41.843 --> 01:00:44.437
{Brill) He's going down.
He'll take all of you with him.

01:00:44.512 --> 01:00:46.605
- {gunshot)
- {Brill) Goddamn!

01:00:46.681 --> 01:00:50.447
{Reynolds) Rachel Banks is not the issue.
Hamersly is.

01:00:50.518 --> 01:00:53.487
He was killed for a purpose.
Where's the tape?

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:56.882
Why did you record it?

01:00:56.958 --> 01:01:04.057
OK, first of all, we were there for technical
support. And, uh, we had no idea...

01:01:04.132 --> 01:01:06.532
- Do they know that Reynolds is dead?
- Yeah.

01:01:06.601 --> 01:01:08.000
- They know all that?
- Right.

01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:09.832
- They're stalling.
- Still stalling.

01:01:09.904 --> 01:01:12.805
- A tape.
- A tape of it.

01:01:12.874 --> 01:01:15.843
- What did you think was going on?
- I thought it was an S.T.O.

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:19.209
- S.T.O.?
- Standard Training Op.

01:01:23.518 --> 01:01:27.454
Congressman! Does this mean
the privacy bill is dead, Congressman?

01:01:27.522 --> 01:01:32.016
In its current form, yes, but the issue is
still very much alive, I can assure you,

01:01:32.093 --> 01:01:35.153
unless, of course, no one worries about
national security anymore.

01:01:44.439 --> 01:01:48.136
{TV) We knew that we had
to monitor our enemies.

01:01:48.209 --> 01:01:53.146
We've also come to realize that we need
to monitor the people monitoring them.

01:01:53.214 --> 01:01:56.775
Well, who's going to monitor
the monitors of the monitors?

01:01:56.851 --> 01:02:00.446
I wouldn't mind doing
a little, uh, monitoring myself.

01:02:00.521 --> 01:02:04.514
Yeah, and you got lots
and lots of monitoring to do.

01:02:04.592 --> 01:02:07.288
Are you guys talking about sex?

01:02:08.229 --> 01:02:10.459
- Boy!
- Oh, no. It's time for dinner.

01:02:10.531 --> 01:02:15.594
Get in there and eat your dinner.
No more hanging with Dylan.

01:02:19.006 --> 01:02:22.942
{channels changing)

01:02:29.317 --> 01:02:31.444
{meows)

01:02:48.603 --> 01:02:51.265
Brill, you are one sick man.

01:02:54.275 --> 01:02:56.573
Yeah, me too.

01:02:58.679 --> 01:03:02.638
Ooh, you're gonna need
to get a tan on those things.

01:03:06.721 --> 01:03:09.053
Congressman Albert.
how do we draw the line...

01:03:09.123 --> 01:03:12.752
between protection
of national security.

01:03:12.827 --> 01:03:16.388
obviously the government's need
to obtain intelligence data.

01:03:16.464 --> 01:03:21.026
and the protection of civil liberties.
particularly the sanctity of my home?

01:03:21.102 --> 01:03:24.868
You've got no right
to come into my home.

01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:31.643
