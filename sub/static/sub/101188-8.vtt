00:00.083 --> 00:01.460
Open the fucking register now!

00:01.543 --> 00:03.003
Everybody get your hands up.

00:03.086 --> 00:05.380
Come on, get over here,
I want everybody to line up over here.

00:05.464 --> 00:07.799
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
Barbara, do you think he saw us?

00:07.883 --> 00:09.218
- Fuck, I don't think so.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.886
I don't know.
- I don't want to die, man,

00:10.969 --> 00:12.221
not like this.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.222
I don't even have a Wikipedia page.

00:13.305 --> 00:14.223
- Ma'am.

00:14.306 --> 00:16.099
- Oh, shit, he saw you.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.100
- What? No, he said "ma'am."

00:17.184 --> 00:18.101
- Yeah, that's you.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.103
- What? I'm not a ma'am.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.188
- Yeah, you are, you're totally a ma'am.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.564
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.358
You've been a ma'am for a long time.
- Ma'am!

00:26.693 --> 00:28.612
Ma'am!

00:28.695 --> 00:30.948
Why don't you go smoke
some more crack, huh?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.741
- You got any?
- What?!

00:32.824 --> 00:34.618
- See, he was talking to the crack whore,
I told you.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.662
- Okay, I don't care.
Listen to me, I have a plan.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.996
You see those Jesus candles?

00:38.080 --> 00:38.997
You're gonna take two of them,

00:39.081 --> 00:40.123
then you're gonna somersault

00:40.207 --> 00:41.542
quietly behind the candy aisle.

00:41.625 --> 00:44.086
From my calculations,
you'll have a perfect vantage point.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.504
- What the fuck are you talking about?

00:45.587 --> 00:46.839
- Come on, Cody, you can take him.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.131
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.758
You're bigger than him.
- Fuck you.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.677
- You are-- you're like twice his size.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.596
- I want everybody to take
their cell phones out and their wallets.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.348
But don't touch your own wallet!

00:56.431 --> 00:59.434
Take the wallet out
of the person to your right.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.811
There's only four phones here,

01:00.894 --> 01:01.937
and there's five of you.
- Fuck this.

01:02.020 --> 01:02.980
I'm calling the cops.
- You're such a pussy.

01:05.899 --> 01:06.942
What are you doing?

01:07.025 --> 01:08.110
- Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.738
- Are you fucking texting Dan right now?

01:11.822 --> 01:12.990
- No, okay, just...

01:13.073 --> 01:14.741
I texted him "I love you" two hours ago,

01:14.825 --> 01:17.661
and he just texted back
"k, you, too," all lowercase.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.787
Like, what the fuck is that?

01:18.871 --> 01:20.998
- I seriously cannot believe you.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.916
Don't you get that this is
like a fucking parable

01:23.000 --> 01:24.459
for the world right now?

01:24.543 --> 01:27.004
Toxic masculinity as represented,
quite literally,

01:27.087 --> 01:28.505
by a dude with a gu...

01:28.589 --> 01:30.465
Well, don't write that.

01:30.549 --> 01:31.508
- Why?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.468
- "Are we okay?"
- What, what?

01:33.552 --> 01:35.762
- If you have to write to your boyfriend
"Are we okay?"

01:35.846 --> 01:37.264
you're definitely not okay.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.557
- Do you think he's cheating on me?

01:38.640 --> 01:39.558
- Honestly?

01:39.641 --> 01:40.726
- Ma'am.
- Yeah.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.144
- Don't say that.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.478
You're gonna give me
a fucking heart attack.

01:43.562 --> 01:44.980
- Ma'am!
- Fuck, oh, my God.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.190
Please don't kill me, Jesus Christ,

01:46.273 --> 01:47.441
please, please, please don't kill me,
oh, my God.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.567
- See, you're totally a ma'am,
I was right.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.735
- Shut up.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.029
- What?
- No, not-- nothing, not you.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.280
- Slide your phone over here.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.781
- Okay, okay, okay, just, um...

01:54.865 --> 01:56.575
I'm so sorry, can I just send one text?

01:56.658 --> 01:57.743
It'll be so fast.

01:57.826 --> 01:58.994
- No! What the fuck?!

01:59.077 --> 02:00.204
- Okay, okay, all right, okay!

02:00.287 --> 02:02.122
All-all right!
- God, you idiot!

02:05.125 --> 02:07.586
- Is that a fucking sex doll?

02:07.669 --> 02:08.587
- Yeah.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.380
- The fuck is around its neck?

02:11.423 --> 02:13.634
- Her vagina?
- Sir,

02:13.717 --> 02:15.677
I'm fully cooperating,
and if you have to kill her,

02:15.761 --> 02:17.137
I completely understand,

02:17.221 --> 02:19.014
and if you have to rape me, I'm down,

02:19.097 --> 02:20.474
but, like, please don't kill me.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.352
- Why the fuck is it wearing a vagina
around its neck?

02:23.435 --> 02:25.646
- Well, it's her,
it's her old vagina, it's...

02:25.729 --> 02:26.939
'Cause, you know, she wa--

02:27.022 --> 02:28.565
she used to be my boyfriend's sex doll

02:28.649 --> 02:29.775
and now, you know, she's just my friend

02:29.858 --> 02:31.193
and she's my writing partner.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.862
She's kind of a,
kind of a handful, actually.

02:33.946 --> 02:35.572
When she was my boyfriend's sex doll,

02:35.656 --> 02:38.075
he didn't, he didn't take
very good care of her, so, like,

02:38.158 --> 02:39.660
hygiene-wise,
her pussy got kind of crusty.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.453
You know, when I say that,

02:41.537 --> 02:43.914
it, like, it-it sounds like I'm saying,
like, he's a pervert.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.749
He's, like, a super sweet guy,
great boyfriend.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.584
He's actually, like,
a really successful TV writer.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.044
He just has kinks, you know.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.004
He's into foot stuff, he's into pantyhose,

02:51.088 --> 02:53.590
and, you know, like,
for a while he just had, um,

02:53.674 --> 02:55.384
like, a mannequin leg,
and he would put pantyhose on it

02:55.467 --> 02:56.885
and he would just, like,
rub it on his nipples,

02:56.969 --> 02:58.095
but then the dog chewed up
the pantyhose leg,

02:58.178 --> 02:59.513
so then he got the sex doll.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.931
It's kind of the...
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

03:01.014 --> 03:05.727
Is your... is your boyfriend Dan Harmon?

03:05.811 --> 03:07.145
- Yeah.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.356
- Oh, my God.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.149
This is crazy.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.402
I am a huge fan.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.945
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.238
- I fucked him every week.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.115
- Uh...
- Oh, my God!

03:18.198 --> 03:21.368
- Rick and Morty is
my favorite TV show of all time.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.786
- That is insane.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.247
- I-- this is crazy.
I'm, like, a total Harmenian,

03:25.330 --> 03:28.166
and, you know, I,
I listen to his podcast every week.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.334
- Right.
- And, as you know, you know,

03:29.418 --> 03:32.129
he really kind of, like,
puts himself out there,

03:32.212 --> 03:33.964
so when you said "sex doll,"

03:34.047 --> 03:36.091
I was like, "Could it be?"

03:36.175 --> 03:38.343
And then you were like, "writer."

03:38.427 --> 03:39.595
And then you said...
- "Foot fetish."

03:39.678 --> 03:41.346
- "...foot fetish"! And I was like,

03:41.430 --> 03:43.515
"Uh, could it be? Yes, it is!"

03:43.599 --> 03:44.766
And now it is!

03:44.850 --> 03:46.560
- Dude, I'm, like, freaking out right now.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.854
This is fucking crazy.
- So am I.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.731
Wow, what a small world.
What are the chances

03:50.814 --> 03:54.484
that, like, you and I would run
into each other like this?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.861
- Very slim.
- Barbara.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.779
- I mean,
it's-it's like a Rick and Morty episode,

03:57.863 --> 03:59.781
but, like, everything
I would be saying would be

03:59.865 --> 04:02.534
so much smarter
because the writing on that show was...

04:05.495 --> 04:07.497
- Oh, my God!

04:07.581 --> 04:08.916
Holy shit!

04:23.138 --> 04:25.140
That was so fucked up.

04:26.517 --> 04:27.935
- What?

04:28.018 --> 04:30.604
- Oh, my God, I'm, like, still shaking.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.189
- Like, me, too, I'm also shaking.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.941
Like, I'm not actually physically shaking,

04:34.024 --> 04:37.361
but I'm also experiencing the trauma
in a very real way.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.696
- That was fucking crazy!

04:39.780 --> 04:41.698
What the fuck just happened to us?!

04:41.782 --> 04:43.075
- That was crazy!

04:43.158 --> 04:45.244
Like, who thought that fucking crack whore

04:45.327 --> 04:46.620
would save the day like that?

04:46.703 --> 04:48.372
- Oh, my God, I know.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.958
You know...

04:51.041 --> 04:53.502
we probably shouldn't call her that
anymore.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.295
- I hundred percent agree.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.880
Well, can you believe that...

04:56.964 --> 04:59.925
crack sex worker
saved the fucking day like that?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.552
- Totally.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.973
Oh, my God, he broke my phone.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.561
I mean, mostly it is very, very sad

05:10.644 --> 05:14.481
that a, like, a human life was taken,
obviously,

05:14.565 --> 05:16.733
and, like, I feel terrible for, like,
the family

05:16.817 --> 05:18.068
of that dead robber.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.653
- Dude, I feel terrible, too.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.489
Like, to echo that, I'm devastated.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.074
- I mean, the whole thing's
like a fucking tragedy.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.201
- It's a tra--
it's... that's a perfect word.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.620
Yeah, it's like a true American tragedy.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.290
But...

05:31.373 --> 05:34.835
you know, it is kind of
one of those tragedies that...

05:34.918 --> 05:36.753
would make an amazing story, right?

05:36.837 --> 05:39.631
- Like, a really good story.

05:39.715 --> 05:40.841
- Like, it'd be almost more of a tragedy

05:40.924 --> 05:42.634
if we didn't tell that story, right?

05:42.718 --> 05:45.679
- Like maybe in a spec script
about a girl and her sex doll?

05:45.762 --> 05:48.098
- Oh, my God, I was having the same idea!

05:48.182 --> 05:49.725
- No.
- Yes, but I didn't want to tell you

05:49.808 --> 05:51.560
'cause I was like,
"She's gonna think I'm a monster."

05:51.643 --> 05:53.103
- Wait, really?
- Hundred percent.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.690
- No. Oh, my God, that's hilarious.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.026
Oh, my God, I'm starving.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.069
Feel like I burned,
like, a million calories

06:01.153 --> 06:03.197
just from having my heart rate
so elevated.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.740
- I know, I'm so hungry.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.826
I would so join you, but...

06:07.910 --> 06:09.536
- You're a sex doll so you can't eat?
- I'm keeping this shit tight.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.537
- All right.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.539
Bitch, you are covered in blood.

06:12.623 --> 06:13.832
- You're covered in blood.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.250
- You look psychotic.

06:15.334 --> 06:16.919
- You look like
you're in the movie Carrie.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.921
- No, I look dope.
