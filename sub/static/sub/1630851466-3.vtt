02:52.150 --> 02:53.290
A wild dog...

02:53.860 --> 02:56.990
never kills without a reason.

02:57.389 --> 03:01.560
It's just that idiots like you
have no idea what the reason is.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.270
Did Jang Gwang Cheol tell you
anything about the boss or revenge?

03:06.069 --> 03:08.138
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

03:08.139 --> 03:10.910
Han Ji Hyuk, wait for me.

03:11.170 --> 03:12.870
I'll come and find you soon.

(Silent Devotion to Protect
and Bring Glory to Korea)

03:22.319 --> 03:24.290
(Episode 3)

03:28.090 --> 03:29.629
Who on earth is he?

03:29.790 --> 03:32.689
I looked him up,
but he's not in our database.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.558
I requested Branch Manager Lee
to give us information on him.

03:35.559 --> 03:37.668
- So we should wait for...
- Don't you know how Chinese are?

03:37.669 --> 03:39.638
It'll take a month
to get their approval.

03:39.639 --> 03:41.468
The game will be over by then.

03:41.469 --> 03:42.839
Maybe it's too early to speculate,

03:42.840 --> 03:45.440
but judging by the fact that he
killed Jang Gwang Cheol like that,

03:47.010 --> 03:50.549
we can't rule out the possibility
that he's Hwang Mo Sool.

03:51.880 --> 03:52.949
What else?

03:52.950 --> 03:56.120
We are analyzing the security cam footage
to track them down,

03:56.319 --> 04:00.329
They invaded the police station
and slaughtered a person.

04:00.330 --> 04:02.399
But we don't have
one decent piece of evidence?

04:02.959 --> 04:04.628
How is that even possible?

04:04.629 --> 04:06.299
What on earth have you been doing?

04:09.200 --> 04:10.469
What about Jang Gwang Cheol?

04:12.140 --> 04:14.109
You guys interrogated him
before he died.

04:15.269 --> 04:16.640
Yes, we did.

04:16.939 --> 04:19.309
But Han Ji Hyuk crossed the line
and assaulted Jang Gwang Cheol.

04:19.310 --> 04:20.849
So we had to stop the interrogation.

04:20.980 --> 04:24.879
I think he was psychologically unstable
to do the job.

04:25.420 --> 04:26.488
Did you record it?

04:26.489 --> 04:29.319
He asked us to stop the recording.

04:31.890 --> 04:34.189
- Where is he?
- Excuse me?

04:34.790 --> 04:37.000
Where is Han Ji Hyuk right now?

05:21.270 --> 05:24.180
It was Lee Choon Gil who visited
the safehouse that day.

05:24.680 --> 05:25.849
Yesterday,

05:26.050 --> 05:29.319
my aunt called and said
she arrived safely in Seoul.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.879
Thank you so much.

05:31.249 --> 05:33.519
When I'm done with this,
I want to go to South Korea...

05:34.189 --> 05:36.920
and live a normal life with my aunt.
That's all I want.

05:37.019 --> 05:38.890
I'll never forget
what you did for me.

05:38.989 --> 05:41.890
But he was still working
for the Huayang Gang.

05:44.130 --> 05:46.029
(ER visitor restrictions)

05:46.299 --> 05:49.239
I need to find him
to bring back my memories.

05:49.869 --> 05:52.139
I'm sure he has a clue.

05:53.719 --> 05:56.278
How about leaking the information

05:56.302 --> 05:58.760
to the IOs... at Daehan Daily?

05:58.830 --> 06:01.599
Let's wait and see how it goes. Yes.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.860
Did you take care of
what I asked you before?

06:03.999 --> 06:07.299
I talked to Chief Seo in person.
I'm sure she understood me.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.069
Okay. Good job.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.589
What is the press release saying?

06:26.689 --> 06:29.958
They are saying
it's a veiled enmity among gangs.

06:29.959 --> 06:32.028
But I don't know how long it'll last.

06:32.029 --> 06:35.329
It must've been leaked to
the national correspondents by now.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.628
We don't know how they'll respond
so keep an eye on them.

06:39.629 --> 06:40.629
Yes, ma'am.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.349
What's wrong with your face?

06:52.350 --> 06:55.119
I got into a car accident
on my way home yesterday.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.489
You got into an accident
on your way home?

06:57.490 --> 06:59.529
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is that so?

07:00.629 --> 07:03.069
You interrogated Jang Gwang
Cheol yesterday. So how did it go?

07:03.230 --> 07:04.800
Did you find something out?

07:05.230 --> 07:07.000
I'm sure you were informed.

07:07.569 --> 07:10.740
When I was interrogating him,
I couldn't control my emotions.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.810
So we had some problems.

07:14.439 --> 07:16.479
Are you saying you
couldn't get anything out of him?

07:16.980 --> 07:18.079
No, ma'am.

07:19.650 --> 07:21.609
Then why are you here?

07:23.179 --> 07:25.750
I want you to take me off this case.

07:26.150 --> 07:27.219
What?

07:28.020 --> 07:29.658
May I ask you why?

07:29.659 --> 07:30.760
Well...

07:31.560 --> 07:34.560
I want to take a week of sick leave.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.358
Yesterday, it seemed like you were up
for anything for the case.

07:38.359 --> 07:41.029
And now you want to take a sick leave?

07:42.169 --> 07:44.900
- Have a word with me.
- No, Director Kang.

07:45.239 --> 07:47.140
If he feels off,
he should take a break.

07:48.039 --> 07:49.679
I'll take you off the case.
You may leave.

07:49.779 --> 07:51.709
- Ma'am.
- What?

07:51.710 --> 07:54.609
You didn't want him on the case
in the first place.

07:56.679 --> 07:57.950
Why are you standing there?

08:01.049 --> 08:02.120
Wait.

08:04.159 --> 08:06.089
Aren't you forgetting anything?

08:27.380 --> 08:29.249
He will never stop investigating.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.750
- I'm sure he's planning...
- I know.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.688
- That's why I let him go.
- Excuse me?

08:33.690 --> 08:36.289
What do you think
we need the most right now?

08:37.559 --> 08:38.719
It's to take a gamble.

08:39.729 --> 08:43.359
We don't have the luxury
to crunch numbers sitting at a desk.

08:43.599 --> 08:45.060
But still.

08:45.460 --> 08:48.570
Letting him go like that is too risky.

08:49.099 --> 08:51.739
That's why I took out insurance.

08:53.570 --> 08:56.108
Han Ji Hyuk is officially off duty.

08:56.109 --> 08:57.940
So if anything happens,

08:58.039 --> 09:00.049
it'll be considered
deviant personal behavior.

09:04.549 --> 09:06.690
Aren't you curious...

09:07.750 --> 09:10.120
to know what he'll find out?

09:12.589 --> 09:15.760
The fact that I'm investigating
the case happened a year ago...

09:16.159 --> 09:18.000
No one can know yet.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.200
I can't trust anyone.

09:22.330 --> 09:23.440
Sir.

09:29.479 --> 09:30.709
Are you okay?

09:30.710 --> 09:32.749
Can I ask you something?

09:32.750 --> 09:34.779
Where did you
get the picture yesterday?

09:36.549 --> 09:38.080
From Intelligence and Analysis.

09:38.419 --> 09:41.519
I told you I got it
from a friend there.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.319
I don't think it's been reported
to the higher-ups.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.229
Can you ask him to hold on
a little longer?

09:48.159 --> 09:50.729
Can I ask you why?

09:57.599 --> 10:00.869
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can help you with that.

10:00.870 --> 10:02.809
I could get in trouble for this.

10:02.810 --> 10:06.250
So I don't think I can do it
without knowing the reason.

10:06.450 --> 10:07.580
I'm very sorry.

10:08.409 --> 10:10.179
What do you want to know?

10:11.620 --> 10:13.989
Tell me what kind of situation
you're in...

10:14.120 --> 10:16.320
so that I can understand you.

10:18.219 --> 10:21.028
You know we had an incident
in China a year ago.

10:21.029 --> 10:24.200
I unintentionally got involved
with the gang.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.599
I think that's why they're after me.

10:26.770 --> 10:28.699
It's personal to me.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.299
So I want to close the case myself.
Is it good enough?

10:33.140 --> 10:35.409
No, actually, there's one more.

10:35.779 --> 10:37.880
Whatever you're planning to do,

10:39.080 --> 10:40.710
let me join you.

10:42.310 --> 10:44.520
Why are you doing this?

10:44.650 --> 10:46.370
Because I want
to claw my way up the ladder.

10:46.789 --> 10:48.719
To be honest,
I volunteered to work in the field...

10:48.720 --> 10:51.120
is because it helps
my performance evaluation.

10:51.390 --> 10:53.630
I'm kind of impatient.

10:55.230 --> 10:57.659
I don't want to waste time
playing it safe.

10:58.730 --> 10:59.870
Yoo Je Yi.

11:05.069 --> 11:07.309
You said you worked
in Intelligence and Analysis, right?

11:07.409 --> 11:09.209
I'm looking for someone.

11:09.309 --> 11:10.409
Can you help?

11:12.980 --> 11:15.849
A North Korean defector came in
through Southeast Asia last year.

11:15.850 --> 11:19.120
She's in her 70s, from Hoeryeong,
North Hamgyong Province.

11:19.689 --> 11:21.149
I heard she used to be a nurse...

11:21.150 --> 11:22.950
- for the Kim family's bodyguards.
- Found it.

11:23.490 --> 11:26.559
Find and ask her
if she knows a Lee Choon Gil.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.100
What is their relationship?

11:33.199 --> 11:36.340
He's her nephew.
She raised him since he was a kid.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.440
(Daniel Medical Care Hospital)

11:42.010 --> 11:43.010
She's in here.

11:54.290 --> 11:55.429
Ma'am.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.500
Hello, my name is Yoo Je Yi.

12:00.329 --> 12:02.598
I'd like to ask you something...

12:02.599 --> 12:04.129
You darn nasty brats.

12:04.130 --> 12:05.799
Why are you so noisy?

12:05.800 --> 12:08.669
Ma'am, I'm Choon Gil's friend.

12:08.670 --> 12:09.839
You're crazy.

12:10.140 --> 12:12.380
Stop talking nonsense and get out!

12:19.979 --> 12:20.979
But...

12:21.849 --> 12:24.319
will she willingly
talk about Lee Choon Gil?

12:25.990 --> 12:28.459
I have a feeling
she'll be pretty wary.

12:29.089 --> 12:30.089
Mr. Han.

12:30.459 --> 12:32.699
Have you heard of "sakguksu"?

12:33.130 --> 12:34.228
When I was a kid,

12:34.229 --> 12:37.829
my aunt would cook me
nongma noodles.

12:38.270 --> 12:39.939
I can't forget the taste.

12:44.740 --> 12:45.740
Ma'am.

12:45.939 --> 12:49.150
There's something Choon Gil
would never stop talking about.

12:50.109 --> 12:53.520
He would say
your sakguksu was the best.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.790
The tastiest in the world.

12:56.020 --> 12:59.959
So when he thinks of you,
he thinks of those noodles.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.500
Are you really...

13:13.300 --> 13:15.170
Choon Gil's friend?

13:16.969 --> 13:18.240
Yes, ma'am.

13:29.750 --> 13:31.150
My Choon Gil.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.559
Does he miss my noodles that much?

13:36.030 --> 13:37.030
Oh, dear.

13:37.490 --> 13:40.859
Why didn't he say so
when we last talked on the phone?

13:41.300 --> 13:42.829
That he wanted noodles.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.339
Did Choon Gil call you?

13:45.900 --> 13:47.000
When?

13:47.469 --> 13:49.109
(Diplomat 083-131)

14:44.839 --> 14:46.338
What happened to you?

14:46.339 --> 14:49.009
I heard you went missing
after an accident.

14:51.879 --> 14:54.379
A lot must have happened.

14:55.119 --> 14:57.920
Your mood has changed.

14:59.759 --> 15:01.160
You know the Huayang Gang, right?

15:02.890 --> 15:05.430
Their boss Hwang Mo Sool
is in Korea.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.498
He was arrested by the police,

15:08.499 --> 15:10.828
but his men attacked
and got him out.

15:10.829 --> 15:11.969
During that mess,

15:12.499 --> 15:14.099
two policemen lost their lives.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.239
What are they doing here?

15:20.810 --> 15:22.709
I thought you might know.

15:27.119 --> 15:31.149
You'll know that the higher-ups
in our party are fighting for power.

15:31.659 --> 15:35.460
It's kept hidden,
but it's practically a war.

15:36.129 --> 15:37.690
Six months ago, was it?

15:37.960 --> 15:40.830
Some influential family's kid
got into trouble with narcotics.

15:41.429 --> 15:43.799
The head of
the Securities Supervisory Board...

15:43.800 --> 15:46.500
and likely the next head of party
lost everything overnight.

15:48.110 --> 15:52.179
It looks simple on the outside,
but in reality, it's not.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.610
The opposition party seems
to have done something in secret.

15:56.710 --> 15:58.678
The opposition party did something?

15:58.679 --> 16:01.319
Yes. The Huayang Gang
sided with them...

16:01.320 --> 16:03.549
and supplied the drugs in secret.

16:06.820 --> 16:08.789
So they used the Huayang Gang...

16:09.929 --> 16:12.659
to sneak drugs to the kids
of opposing high-up politicians.

16:13.529 --> 16:14.570
Is that it?

16:14.899 --> 16:17.330
Our government
works nothing like yours.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.769
The Public Security Bureau
crushed their supply chain.

16:21.110 --> 16:25.080
I'm guessing the Huayang Gang
isn't here on holiday.

16:25.580 --> 16:28.149
They have absolutely nowhere
to go back to.

16:28.450 --> 16:29.480
Okay.

16:32.519 --> 16:35.049
Why did they get involved
in something like this?

16:37.120 --> 16:39.159
It doesn't seem like a coincidence.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.699
You're right.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.669
They had a mastermind
who controlled them from behind.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.939
Someone called Bai Mo She.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.309
"Baek Mo Sa"?

16:56.709 --> 16:59.879
He controls underground information
from near the China border...

16:59.880 --> 17:01.849
and monopolizes everything
including drugs,

17:01.850 --> 17:03.689
smuggling, and weapons.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.490
You could say...

17:06.959 --> 17:09.559
he's a criminal above the criminals.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.089
Do you have his details?

17:11.390 --> 17:13.959
No. I don't have anything.

17:15.059 --> 17:17.429
He's even thought to be a "heihu,"
without any registration.

17:18.630 --> 17:22.140
That's really all I can tell you.

17:34.529 --> 17:35.638
How did it go?

17:35.639 --> 17:38.399
The care hospital
Lee Choon Gil's aunt is at.

17:38.670 --> 17:39.670
I found it.

17:40.869 --> 17:44.309
I asked and she talked
to Lee Choon Gil last weekend.

17:44.310 --> 17:45.908
Did you trace the number?

17:45.909 --> 17:49.249
I looked up the incoming calls
that came in around that time,

17:49.619 --> 17:52.119
and one had the area code 3040.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.489
- Area code 3040?
- It's a prepaid phone.

17:55.090 --> 17:57.518
I checked the call history
of that number,

17:57.519 --> 17:59.659
and there were seven outgoing calls.

17:59.859 --> 18:01.729
The phone was registered
15 days ago.

18:02.430 --> 18:03.499
Take a look.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.268
Where is this?

18:07.269 --> 18:09.868
It's a warehouse
near the outer ring road.

18:09.869 --> 18:11.998
Six of the seven outgoing calls
from that number...

18:11.999 --> 18:14.268
pinged off a cell tower nearby.

18:14.269 --> 18:16.509
Good job. Send this to my phone.

18:18.739 --> 18:19.978
Have you forgotten?

18:19.979 --> 18:21.909
I'm working on this case with you.

18:22.180 --> 18:23.180
Or...

18:24.450 --> 18:26.489
shall I call the director?

18:44.139 --> 18:46.480
Hey, you. What are you doing here?

18:46.809 --> 18:47.980
Are you a cop?

18:51.980 --> 18:53.119
Lee Choon Gil.

18:53.490 --> 18:55.250
What did you just say?

18:55.649 --> 18:57.990
Did you get high here? Get lost.

19:10.569 --> 19:11.639
You jerk.

19:24.339 --> 19:25.440
Hey!

19:27.010 --> 19:28.040
Darn it.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.210
Just answer my questions.

19:50.309 --> 19:51.849
Why were you there that day?

19:53.550 --> 19:55.780
I gave you the intel myself.

19:56.119 --> 19:57.349
Don't you remember that?

19:58.690 --> 20:00.050
What intel?

20:01.659 --> 20:03.159
That Hwang Mo Sool...

20:04.329 --> 20:06.760
was going to show up in Shenyang.
Didn't I tell you that?

20:07.460 --> 20:09.300
You seriously don't remember that?

20:20.149 --> 20:21.280
Listen up.

20:22.350 --> 20:26.449
You're going to tell me everything
that happened that day.

20:29.090 --> 20:30.359
Can you do that?

20:51.040 --> 20:52.850
What is it?

20:53.149 --> 20:54.280
Listen.

20:54.850 --> 20:56.449
You have to leave right now.

20:56.719 --> 20:58.419
My guys are on their way here.

20:58.889 --> 20:59.919
What?

20:59.949 --> 21:02.689
I'm positive that intel leaked
from your side.

21:03.090 --> 21:04.290
Think about it.

21:04.590 --> 21:07.459
Who else knows about this location?
You just got here.

21:08.189 --> 21:11.260
Only you and your guys know
about this location.

21:13.169 --> 21:17.040
I'm certain that
one of them leaked the intel.

21:19.109 --> 21:20.569
Word is that Hwang Mo Sool...

21:20.570 --> 21:22.409
is going to set up something big
in Shenyang.

21:22.909 --> 21:25.449
So you should go over there
and wait there.

21:25.609 --> 21:28.609
Don't tell your guys
where you're headed for now.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.219
And don't contact anyone either.

21:30.949 --> 21:32.050
Are you listening?

21:32.619 --> 21:34.919
- Mr. Han.
- Yes.

21:35.359 --> 21:37.419
Are you sure
Hwang Mo Sool is involved?

21:38.419 --> 21:39.689
I'll tell you the details...

21:40.689 --> 21:42.330
on the phone.

21:49.270 --> 21:50.570
Keep in mind...

21:51.439 --> 21:53.439
that you cannot trust anyone
from now on.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.689
That's the last thing I remember with you.

22:09.390 --> 22:10.590
Mr. Han.

22:22.269 --> 22:24.739
- Did you call this in?
- No.

22:30.409 --> 22:32.679
- Wrap things up here for me.
- What?

22:33.550 --> 22:36.120
Sir. Hey, you! Sit back down!

22:38.019 --> 22:39.719
Wait. Hey!

22:45.550 --> 22:48.289
Do you know anything else
about Hwang Mo Sool?

22:48.420 --> 22:50.690
My role is too insignificant.

22:51.019 --> 22:52.690
So I don't know much.

22:53.229 --> 22:55.430
He's notorious for being elusive.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.069
This was my first time
seeing his face too.

22:58.900 --> 23:01.269
What were you doing
in that warehouse earlier?

23:03.370 --> 23:05.009
What were you doing?

23:07.569 --> 23:08.910
We were sending...

23:10.039 --> 23:11.450
the shipment.

23:12.180 --> 23:15.548
We were smuggling 200kg
of ultra-pure meth...

23:15.549 --> 23:18.390
from Heungnam Pharmaceuticals'
factory in Huadong to Incheon.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.488
I've been in this business
for quite some time.

23:20.489 --> 23:22.789
But I've never seen that much volume.

23:23.890 --> 23:25.528
It looks like they decided to set up...

23:25.529 --> 23:27.690
a supply route here
starting with this shipment.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.499
We use courier services
to distribute them in China.

23:30.630 --> 23:33.100
So they decided to use
the same method here.

23:36.299 --> 23:38.109
We portioned them in the warehouse.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.340
And we distributed them
all over Korea via courier.

23:41.580 --> 23:45.680
But I heard that
all the stuff we sent was nothing.

23:45.979 --> 23:47.350
What do you mean?

23:48.380 --> 23:51.989
Word is that we'll get
a massive shipment pretty soon.

23:52.489 --> 23:53.789
And once it arrives,

23:54.519 --> 23:57.059
it will drive everyone
in this country into chaos.

23:57.559 --> 23:58.728
And what is that exactly?

23:58.729 --> 24:00.360
That's all I heard.

24:01.759 --> 24:04.330
I told you everything I know now.

24:08.029 --> 24:09.940
I have no place to go now.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.009
The higher-ups won't let me
get away with this.

24:12.239 --> 24:13.469
Lee Choon Gil.

24:14.469 --> 24:17.680
You said your wish was to live here
with your aunt.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.748
So you remembered that?

24:20.749 --> 24:24.219
Then how come you didn't call
the emergency number I gave you...

24:24.890 --> 24:26.620
when I went missing?

24:27.989 --> 24:30.559
If you did,
we could have protected you.

24:30.959 --> 24:34.289
Mr. Han, you don't know anything...

24:34.630 --> 24:35.999
what I...

24:42.969 --> 24:44.039
I'm sorry.

25:10.059 --> 25:12.499
(Name, Address)

25:14.840 --> 25:15.999
Sir.

25:18.170 --> 25:20.570
This is the forensic report
on Jang Gwang Cheol's cell phone.

25:23.009 --> 25:24.539
- Thanks. Get back to work.
- Okay.

(Call history)

25:52.670 --> 25:55.379
I'm tracking down the numbers
from Jang Gwang Cheol's phone now.

25:55.380 --> 25:58.279
I'm expecting to find a lead
pretty soon.

25:58.509 --> 26:00.449
Are you sure he's still in Korea?

26:00.450 --> 26:03.119
We're using all of our resources
to shut down routes for stowaways.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.518
Seeing how I haven't received
any reports yet,

26:05.519 --> 26:06.919
I'm sure he's still in Korea.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.819
We're battling against time now.

26:09.059 --> 26:10.989
All of you need to be
at the top of your game.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.090
Yes, ma'am.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.640
(Contacts: 52, Calls: 48)

26:26.209 --> 26:27.268
Yes, sir.

26:27.269 --> 26:29.380
Call Intelligence and Analysis.

26:29.580 --> 26:32.748
And tell them to send me
the cell phone forensic report...

26:32.749 --> 26:34.278
I read this morning at my meeting.

26:34.279 --> 26:35.680
Yes, sir.

26:43.190 --> 26:44.318
What's this?

26:44.319 --> 26:46.690
They were sending out drugs
in that warehouse earlier.

26:46.830 --> 26:47.890
What?

26:51.299 --> 26:52.370
Via courier?

26:52.900 --> 26:54.899
They were using courier services.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.768
Right. These are the invoice labels.

26:56.769 --> 26:58.340
That means if we use these labels,

26:58.739 --> 27:01.309
we'll be able to round up
the drug dealers all over Korea...

27:01.709 --> 27:03.278
in one go!

27:03.279 --> 27:04.609
Sure, that's possible.

27:04.610 --> 27:06.708
But there's something
we need to do first.

27:06.709 --> 27:07.709
Take a look at this.

27:11.279 --> 27:12.288
What is this?

27:12.289 --> 27:15.058
Lee Choon Gil said
a much bigger shipment of drugs,

27:15.059 --> 27:16.920
will be coming in.

27:17.390 --> 27:19.630
I think it's a clue regarding that.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.959
It looks like a serial number.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.699
Can you figure it out?

27:25.700 --> 27:27.799
I'll search the database
back at HQ.

27:28.130 --> 27:30.100
It's urgent, so please hurry.

27:31.340 --> 27:33.670
Yes, sir. Just a minute.

27:36.180 --> 27:37.239
Okay.

(Director Kang Pil Ho)

27:50.190 --> 27:51.990
Why did you want to meet
at a place like this?

27:53.229 --> 27:55.529
What have you been doing?

27:57.799 --> 28:00.630
Here. Explain this first.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.039
(Images from
Jang Gwang Cheol's cell phone)

28:06.040 --> 28:08.179
Why was that in
Jang Gwang Cheol's phone?

28:08.439 --> 28:10.080
And what's going on with Chief Ha?

28:10.580 --> 28:12.549
What were you to scheming?

28:12.550 --> 28:15.449
Did you think I wouldn't know
if you swiped it first?

28:17.419 --> 28:19.020
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.830
I'll get you desk duty
or make you work from home.

28:23.330 --> 28:24.400
It's nothing much.

28:26.259 --> 28:27.798
There was a little mishap...

28:27.799 --> 28:30.028
with the Huayang Gang
while I was in Dandong.

28:30.029 --> 28:32.299
You're digging into them alone,
aren't you?

28:33.600 --> 28:34.669
Do you think...

28:36.369 --> 28:38.489
Deputy Commissioner Do doesn't know
what you're doing?

28:39.109 --> 28:40.948
She knows, but she's letting you be.

28:40.949 --> 28:43.179
So that she can be blameless
if things go south.

28:47.719 --> 28:50.020
You're being used, kid.

28:51.959 --> 28:53.060
Stop here.

28:54.060 --> 28:56.429
Don't be stubborn. Walk away.

28:56.730 --> 29:00.199
"Always make the other person think
they are using me."

29:01.600 --> 29:03.169
"That is our motto."

29:04.770 --> 29:06.540
That's what you said to me.

29:07.540 --> 29:10.540
The person in command
of the situation right now...

29:12.139 --> 29:13.209
is me.

29:17.480 --> 29:18.480
What is this?

29:18.719 --> 29:20.589
The Huayang Gang brought in...

29:20.590 --> 29:22.070
hundreds of kilos
of North Korean ice.

29:22.759 --> 29:25.058
They sent them via courier
to all the major cities.

29:25.059 --> 29:26.459
These are the invoices.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.700
This will give our department
the highest numbers in the agency.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.170
Give me two more days.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.309
I'll find Hwang Mo Sool.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.749
Darn it. What is this?

29:58.619 --> 29:59.889
What is it?

30:00.059 --> 30:02.359
Think hard. Hurry. No.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.930
Think slowly.

30:07.970 --> 30:10.099

How may I help you?

30:19.710 --> 30:22.280
Did everyone go somewhere?

30:23.119 --> 30:25.950
Yes, they did.
But what may I help you with?

30:27.889 --> 30:29.359
I haven't seen you before.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.519
I'm Chief Seo of this center.

30:32.520 --> 30:36.230
I see. Hello. I'm Yoo Je Yi

30:36.460 --> 30:38.159
Are you Ji Hyuk's partner?

30:38.599 --> 30:39.599
Yes.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.369
And he is...

30:42.839 --> 30:44.339
not in today, I guess?

30:44.700 --> 30:47.240
He isn't feeling well,
so he's taking a few days off.

30:47.909 --> 30:51.409
Are you close to Agent Han?

30:52.510 --> 30:54.148
We used to be on the same team.

30:54.149 --> 30:55.849
I see. Okay.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.180
Isn't it tough?

31:00.060 --> 31:01.159
It's fine.

31:01.259 --> 31:04.430
He may be a bit aloof,
but he looks out for me.

31:07.260 --> 31:08.270
Do you mind...

31:08.930 --> 31:13.540
if I give you some advice
as someone who worked with him?

31:13.899 --> 31:15.369
Yes, of course.

31:18.440 --> 31:19.579
Don't get...

31:20.740 --> 31:22.149
too close to him.

31:31.889 --> 31:33.319
To him,

31:34.159 --> 31:36.530
colleagues are nothing more
than tools...

31:37.329 --> 31:38.829
that he can use and throw away.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.259
I'm certain that...

31:51.060 --> 31:53.229
one of them leaked the intel.

32:11.980 --> 32:13.178
Word is that Hwang Mo Sool...

32:13.179 --> 32:15.949
is going to set up something big
in Shenyang.

32:16.389 --> 32:18.959
So you should go over there
and wait there.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.219
Hwang Mo Sool.

33:10.860 --> 33:11.868
Hey.

33:11.869 --> 33:13.169
I found it.

33:13.869 --> 33:16.368
You said a huge shipment of drugs...

33:16.369 --> 33:18.139
was coming in.

33:18.639 --> 33:20.509
It suddenly came to me.

33:20.510 --> 33:23.208
If they're bringing something
of that volume,

33:23.209 --> 33:24.510
they'll need a larger vehicle.

33:24.780 --> 33:26.309
So? What is it?

33:27.510 --> 33:28.519
A container.

33:29.820 --> 33:32.650
The letters in the front refer to
Wanhui, a Chinese shipping company.

33:33.119 --> 33:35.820
The numbers refer to
the container number.

33:36.459 --> 33:38.590
I think they're bringing in
a massive shipment.

33:38.760 --> 33:42.099
A 40ft container
is the largest size.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.598
Where is it now?

33:43.599 --> 33:45.329
Just a moment.

33:45.729 --> 33:47.938
Based on the distribution system,

33:47.939 --> 33:51.269
it arrived at a container terminal
in Incheon three hours ago.

33:51.869 --> 33:53.869
I'll head out now. See you there.

33:54.340 --> 33:55.340
Okay.

34:13.579 --> 34:16.349
Given the shipping company's name,
it should be around here.

34:16.619 --> 34:18.748
Shouldn't we call for backup?

34:18.750 --> 34:20.090
No. We don't need to.

34:21.289 --> 34:24.159
I'll go look for the container.
You wait here.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.789
Tell me
if you see anything suspicious.

34:28.090 --> 34:29.230
Wait.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.329
This is too dangerous.

34:34.599 --> 34:36.279
You said you wanted
to climb up to the top.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.510
Did you want to take them on
without taking on this much risk?

35:46.089 --> 35:48.160
Sir. Three cars are coming in.

35:48.350 --> 35:49.919
Get out of there now.

35:50.589 --> 35:51.659
Sir.

35:54.860 --> 35:55.960
Sir.

36:01.259 --> 36:02.369
Hands up.

36:02.830 --> 36:04.029
Don't move.

36:29.630 --> 36:31.159
Get out of there.

36:44.810 --> 36:46.080
Get him.

36:50.820 --> 36:52.119
Mr. Han.

36:54.089 --> 36:55.419
Help me.

37:05.160 --> 37:07.770
Should I cut off his head
and feed it to the fish?

37:10.069 --> 37:11.399
Drop the gun.

37:32.489 --> 37:33.759
On your knees.

38:29.619 --> 38:31.090
Hwang Mo Sool.

38:52.239 --> 38:53.340
He's awake.

39:20.440 --> 39:21.868
How dare you?

39:21.869 --> 39:23.909
Look up straight.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.170
Darn it.

39:51.639 --> 39:54.340
You dare touch what is mine?

40:12.190 --> 40:13.320
You...

40:14.159 --> 40:16.090
don't seem to fear me.

40:17.460 --> 40:18.658
Good.

40:18.659 --> 40:22.469
We could become really close.

40:40.789 --> 40:42.119
Family.

40:42.820 --> 40:44.759
I couldn't help it.

40:45.059 --> 40:47.129
He did some stupid stuff,

40:47.130 --> 40:50.129
but I never hated or resented him.

40:50.130 --> 40:52.829
I'm talking about my son!

40:57.800 --> 40:59.170
He came home...

40:59.639 --> 41:01.769
with the back of his head blown off.

41:01.770 --> 41:04.079
I didn't bury him for over ten days.

41:05.179 --> 41:06.309
The thing is,

41:07.009 --> 41:09.150
I was high at the time,

41:09.449 --> 41:13.420
and each time I sobered up,
it felt as if he'd wake up.

41:14.449 --> 41:17.920
You have no idea how many days
I ate and slept next to him.

41:18.690 --> 41:20.459
Until he rotted away...

41:20.460 --> 41:23.460
and started to smell like crazy.

41:24.360 --> 41:29.030
That's when even these guys
began to look at me like I was mad.

41:31.340 --> 41:32.599
Just like...

41:34.070 --> 41:36.440
how you're looking at me.

41:45.579 --> 41:49.090
I still smell him on me.

41:51.989 --> 41:53.090
How is it?

41:54.030 --> 41:55.590
Do I still smell?

42:04.340 --> 42:07.839
When I was young,
whenever there was a market,

42:07.840 --> 42:10.210
we'd slaughter dozens of dogs.

42:10.340 --> 42:12.879
I'd connect a steel rod
to a truck battery,

42:12.880 --> 42:15.179
then shove it down their throats.

42:15.309 --> 42:18.178
They'd froth at the mouth
and shake like crazy,

42:18.179 --> 42:22.219
and then the light in their eyes
would slowly go out.

42:23.889 --> 42:27.230
That was the last job
the others wanted to do,

42:27.529 --> 42:30.089
but I was different.

42:31.259 --> 42:33.298
I did that all day long...

42:33.299 --> 42:35.569
and never got sick of it.

42:57.819 --> 43:00.758
I'm starting to get curious.

43:00.759 --> 43:03.589
Will your heart explode first,

43:03.929 --> 43:07.569
or will your eyeballs pop first?

43:57.449 --> 43:59.279
Why are you looking at me like that?

44:00.279 --> 44:03.989
Don't tell me
that you still have hope.

44:06.020 --> 44:07.730
Hey, give me that.

44:16.500 --> 44:20.040
I hope you weren't counting on this.

44:24.179 --> 44:25.659
You're going to get caught
on purpose?

44:26.380 --> 44:28.579
The guys from the Huayang Gang
must be here soon.

44:28.580 --> 44:29.809
Once they take me,

44:29.810 --> 44:31.795
come to the address
you see on this device to find me.

44:31.819 --> 44:34.190
I have GPS trackers
on my belt and shoes.

44:34.389 --> 44:36.750
Just follow the address
on this device.

44:37.089 --> 44:39.020
Then we'll be able
to find their base.

44:46.460 --> 44:47.698
He might not look so impressive,

44:47.699 --> 44:49.468
but he was in the special forces
in North Korea.

44:49.469 --> 44:51.638
We changed our routes for hours...

44:51.639 --> 44:54.609
and made sure
that no one was tailing us.

44:55.909 --> 44:58.440
Now, do you know what that means?

44:58.779 --> 45:02.549
That you are utterly hopeless.

45:10.549 --> 45:11.560
What?

45:14.429 --> 45:15.460
You're laughing?

45:16.859 --> 45:20.299
It's just that you and I seem
to be in the same boat.

45:23.470 --> 45:24.540
Fine.

45:27.100 --> 45:30.270
Just like you said, I'm hopeless.

45:32.080 --> 45:34.079
I don't think
I can make it out here alive.

45:34.080 --> 45:35.310
Then what about you?

45:36.950 --> 45:39.750
I heard you royally messed up
in the mainland.

45:41.049 --> 45:43.449
I don't think you have
supply routes anymore.

45:43.450 --> 45:45.610
Seeing how you're on a peninsula,
surrounded by oceans,

45:45.660 --> 45:47.319
I wonder how long you can last.

45:48.930 --> 45:52.299
You are trapped here just like I am.

45:52.529 --> 45:54.060
You punk.

45:55.270 --> 45:56.399
Open that.

45:57.100 --> 45:58.700
Why don't you finish him here?

45:58.839 --> 46:01.239
Open that now!

46:22.629 --> 46:25.459
What do you think?
I bet you didn't see that coming.

46:26.230 --> 46:27.898
I recruited this expert...

46:27.899 --> 46:30.430
from Jeongseong Pharmaceuticals'
factory in Pyongyang.

46:30.529 --> 46:34.839
He's the best chemist
who was educated in North Korea.

46:35.140 --> 46:38.680
And I brought in this new method
that will knock your socks off.

46:41.049 --> 46:42.410
Do you see his tattoos?

46:42.980 --> 46:45.849
Those tattoos are the recipe.

46:45.850 --> 46:48.188
With this method, nothing stinks.
And there's no exhaust gas too.

46:48.189 --> 46:51.389
Everything from the materials
and the production time...

46:51.390 --> 46:54.389
is totally different
from our previous method.

46:54.390 --> 46:58.859
In other words,
this will go down in history.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.700
It's a revolution.

47:02.170 --> 47:04.678
So you're letting them catch you...

47:04.679 --> 47:06.778
because you want him to feel
he has the upper hand,

47:06.779 --> 47:11.708
so he will voluntarily share
the intelligence with you?

47:11.709 --> 47:13.119
Hwang Mo Sool executed...

47:13.120 --> 47:14.879
his right-hand man
at the police station.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.190
He loves displaying his power.

47:17.449 --> 47:18.689
I'll use that against him.

47:18.790 --> 47:20.160
This is absurd.

47:20.790 --> 47:22.660
This is flat-out crazy.

47:22.959 --> 47:26.029
On top of that, they will easily
find the GPS trackers.

47:26.500 --> 47:27.659
This is the real one.

47:28.700 --> 47:29.800
What's that?

47:32.240 --> 47:33.399
A GPS capsule.

47:34.140 --> 47:36.470
Once I swallow it,
no device can detect this tracker.

47:39.280 --> 47:41.080
Well, until they cut
my stomach open.

47:44.850 --> 47:46.918
I bet you thought...

47:46.919 --> 47:50.919
I distributed the drugs via courier
without having a plan.

47:53.459 --> 47:54.760
Hey, bring him in.

48:02.129 --> 48:05.039
Did you really think I wouldn't know
he was your informant?

48:10.939 --> 48:12.109
Look at this jerk.

48:12.939 --> 48:14.709
I think he's out of it.

48:14.850 --> 48:17.479
Hey, this is boring. Take him away.

48:18.479 --> 48:19.479
Choon Gil.

48:20.220 --> 48:21.289
Choon Gil.

48:22.089 --> 48:24.249
Wake up. Lee Choon Gil!

48:29.959 --> 48:31.700
Did you leak the intel on purpose?

48:32.100 --> 48:35.129
Your brain is finally working now.

48:35.370 --> 48:38.740
You're right. I wanted to use
you guys to achieve my goal.

48:39.070 --> 48:41.808
If you take charge
and round up the dealers,

48:41.809 --> 48:45.208
the supply routes
from Southeast Asia will be cut.

48:45.209 --> 48:49.209
And the drugs here will dry up slowly,
yet surely.

48:49.950 --> 48:51.478
But look at us.

48:51.479 --> 48:54.450
We can make our stuff
wherever we want.

48:54.749 --> 48:56.919
What do you think?
Doesn't listening to my plan...

48:57.820 --> 48:59.359
give you a thrill?

49:00.859 --> 49:01.859
You're right.

49:02.490 --> 49:05.660
They had a mastermind
who controlled them from behind.

49:05.859 --> 49:07.760
Someone called Bai Mo She.

49:11.740 --> 49:13.499
So you came up
with this whole thing?

49:16.439 --> 49:17.539
No, right?

49:18.609 --> 49:19.640
Exactly.

49:22.010 --> 49:23.709
I doubt that you came up with this.

49:25.080 --> 49:28.350
I get the feeling that
there's a mastermind behind you.

49:29.019 --> 49:30.519
Is that Baek Mo Sa?

49:38.760 --> 49:40.530
Shut your mouth!

49:44.870 --> 49:47.439
Two years ago,
you eliminated my guys...

49:49.140 --> 49:50.939
on his order, right?

49:54.439 --> 49:57.580
You fool.
You really have no idea, do you?

50:02.550 --> 50:03.649
You really don't know...

50:03.850 --> 50:06.890
who's responsible
for the deaths of your subordinates?

50:09.430 --> 50:12.359
It's me.

50:12.700 --> 50:13.830
Me.

50:18.339 --> 50:20.339
Why the long face?

50:20.899 --> 50:22.769
You still don't remember?

50:23.010 --> 50:26.479
Do you want me to tell you
what I did with them?

50:28.149 --> 50:29.149
Listen.

50:30.149 --> 50:33.018
I used my own hands to slit open...

50:33.019 --> 50:35.620
their necks like this.

50:37.050 --> 50:39.559
You...

50:42.890 --> 50:44.700
What was that?

50:51.939 --> 50:56.370
It looks like you finally fear me.

50:57.609 --> 50:59.240
Han Ji Hyuk!

51:08.939 --> 51:10.310
What are you doing?

51:17.080 --> 51:18.749
How dare you?

51:19.220 --> 51:21.879
(Mr. Baek)

51:39.576 --> 51:40.645
Sir.

51:41.869 --> 51:43.980
Come on.

51:46.539 --> 51:49.550
Then how will you send me
the rescue signal?

51:49.649 --> 51:51.479
Remember the GPS capsule
I swallowed?

51:52.149 --> 51:53.789
I'm going to throw it up
and break it.

51:55.850 --> 51:59.519
So a disconnected GPS tracker
is my signal?

51:59.660 --> 52:00.829
Whatever happens,

52:00.830 --> 52:03.228
you cannot make a move
until you get my signal.

52:03.229 --> 52:04.300
Do you understand that?

52:04.459 --> 52:06.069
What if...
you never send me the signal?

52:06.970 --> 52:07.999
Not possible.

52:24.249 --> 52:25.649
What's wrong with this punk?

52:31.160 --> 52:32.430
(Office)

52:37.730 --> 52:38.870
You...

52:40.440 --> 52:41.440
Hey!

52:52.310 --> 52:53.679
Hey, Han Ji Hyuk!

52:59.990 --> 53:02.760
Yes, I'm certain. Yes.

53:02.930 --> 53:04.728
I need you to send me
everyone you can.

53:04.729 --> 53:05.759
Send them immediately!

53:05.760 --> 53:08.159
Hello, welcome. How may I help you?

53:08.769 --> 53:11.100
Give me the master key
to the penthouse.

53:11.569 --> 53:12.700
Now!

53:12.899 --> 53:15.540
I need to report that
to my manager first.

53:15.541 --> 53:16.570
Now.

56:22.929 --> 56:25.299
Lee Choon Gil. Focus.

56:26.739 --> 56:28.000
Mr. Han.

56:28.440 --> 56:29.969
Don't talk or move.

56:34.880 --> 56:36.549
This is it for me.

56:40.049 --> 56:41.779
You asked me...

56:42.989 --> 56:44.089
why I didn't...

56:44.790 --> 56:48.020
contact the NIS after that incident.

56:51.029 --> 56:53.759
Actually, at that time...

57:32.730 --> 57:34.839
So you want a taste of the field?

57:36.100 --> 57:38.770
It's like a swamp,
covered in blood and sweat.

57:40.080 --> 57:42.810
And to get out of the swamp,
you must have this.

57:44.549 --> 57:48.150
Firm determination
to achieve your goal.

57:48.549 --> 57:49.819
That's what you need.

58:15.409 --> 58:16.509
Sir.

58:17.150 --> 58:18.250
Sir!

58:46.610 --> 58:47.979
Are you all right?

59:06.729 --> 59:08.200
Where's Hwang Mo Sool?

59:53.840 --> 59:56.150
We're on our way.
Get the boat ready.

01:00:40.049 --> 01:00:41.658
This just in.

01:00:41.659 --> 01:00:45.388
Members of an international drug cartel
who ran a large-scale meth lab...

01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:48.098
were arrested at a hotel
near Gwanghwamun.

01:00:48.099 --> 01:00:49.698
The drugs that were seized...

01:00:49.699 --> 01:00:52.968
at the scene were enough
for 500,000 people at the same time.

01:00:52.969 --> 01:00:55.767
The drug cartel used a new method
that didn't create any smells...

01:00:55.768 --> 01:00:57.267
during the production.

01:00:57.268 --> 01:01:01.909
So the hotel was completely unaware
of the meth lab.

01:01:02.108 --> 01:01:04.707
According to the police's investigation,
before entering Korea,

01:01:04.708 --> 01:01:07.048
they booked the hotel where they'd make
the drugs before their arrival...

01:01:07.049 --> 01:01:08.678
and divided the roles,

01:01:08.679 --> 01:01:11.818
committing crimes
scattered over the nation.

01:01:12.119 --> 01:01:15.687
Yes. We have information
on the nationwide distribution,

01:01:15.688 --> 01:01:17.287
so it's just the beginning.

01:01:17.288 --> 01:01:19.187
We'll continue to hear good news.

01:01:19.188 --> 01:01:20.358
Thank you, sir.

01:01:20.858 --> 01:01:23.929
I'll give you a report
in person soon. Bye.

01:01:27.398 --> 01:01:29.998
Hey. You're back.

01:01:30.538 --> 01:01:31.568
Sorry.

01:01:32.108 --> 01:01:33.809
Did you enjoy your sick leave?

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:35.238
Yes.

01:01:35.239 --> 01:01:38.108
I told you to rest,
but you look even worse.

01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:41.179
Were you in a car crash?

01:01:42.219 --> 01:01:44.148
I had personal business to sort out.

01:01:48.918 --> 01:01:50.588
I wonder what that is.

01:02:04.738 --> 01:02:05.769
You can go.

01:02:39.968 --> 01:02:41.479
(Will you delete 11 files?)

01:03:15.509 --> 01:03:18.708
This last case. It was all you.

01:03:19.138 --> 01:03:22.409
It's because of what happened
a year ago, isn't it?

01:03:24.748 --> 01:03:26.248
Who told you what, exactly?

01:03:26.819 --> 01:03:28.589
Don't act so sensitive.

01:03:29.819 --> 01:03:31.659
I just came to confirm.

01:03:34.429 --> 01:03:35.458
So,

01:03:36.998 --> 01:03:38.998
did you find out anything on...

01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:41.399
who killed Kyung Seok?

01:03:44.098 --> 01:03:45.199
Your memory.

01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:48.168
Did anything come back?

01:03:51.078 --> 01:03:52.179
Remember.

01:03:53.509 --> 01:03:55.208
That memory isn't just yours.

01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:58.649
If you remember something,

01:03:59.549 --> 01:04:02.518
I need to know, whatever the case.

01:04:03.388 --> 01:04:04.518
Do you get that?

01:04:09.958 --> 01:04:11.429
Your partner Je Yi.

01:04:13.199 --> 01:04:15.069
She seemed clueless.

01:04:21.038 --> 01:04:22.569
Don't bring her in any deeper.

01:04:24.509 --> 01:04:26.308
That's a request as a colleague.

01:04:36.359 --> 01:04:38.958
(Yoo Je Yi)

01:04:46.199 --> 01:04:48.598
My body shook for a while.

01:04:53.168 --> 01:04:54.239
Sir.

01:04:54.909 --> 01:04:56.708
You don't have anything...

01:04:57.279 --> 01:04:58.779
you want to protect, do you?

01:05:00.409 --> 01:05:01.848
Not even yourself.

01:05:04.379 --> 01:05:07.787
That means that
the person working with you...

01:05:07.788 --> 01:05:09.958
needs to have the same attitude.

01:05:14.989 --> 01:05:17.529
It sounds like you want out.

01:05:19.598 --> 01:05:20.598
No.

01:05:22.598 --> 01:05:23.969
I hope we get along.

01:05:26.538 --> 01:05:28.038
I came to say that.

01:05:28.739 --> 01:05:30.508
Why are you going this far?

01:05:30.509 --> 01:05:31.978
I told you.

01:05:32.138 --> 01:05:34.877
I want to climb the ladder and fast.

01:05:34.878 --> 01:05:35.909
No.

01:05:37.649 --> 01:05:39.048
The real reason.

01:05:43.419 --> 01:05:44.459
I...

01:05:46.159 --> 01:05:47.959
want power.

01:05:50.699 --> 01:05:52.499
To protect what's dear to me.

01:06:10.249 --> 01:06:11.289
Sir.

01:06:14.628 --> 01:06:15.829
Welcome back.

01:07:15.168 --> 01:07:16.768
(Main missions,
deleted from database)

01:07:16.769 --> 01:07:17.808
(Director Choi Il Lak's Suicide)

01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:19.239
(Suspicious NIS Suicide)

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:22.978
(Disappeared during mission)

01:07:22.979 --> 01:07:23.979
(Yoo Joon Man)

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:25.460
(NIS Agent Taken North
During Mission)

01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:49.599
This is just...

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:53.439
the beginning.

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.319
I'm doing okay, right?

01:08:03.578 --> 01:08:04.588
Dad.

01:08:16.828 --> 01:08:19.328
(Special thanks to Ok Ja Yeon
and Oh Ryoong.)

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:23.439
(The Veil)

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:56.537
I'm going to turn everything
upside down.

01:08:56.537 --> 01:08:58.337
Every single thing.

01:08:58.339 --> 01:08:59.808
Our main server
got hacked yesterday.

01:08:59.809 --> 01:09:01.337
They took just the top secret stuff.

01:09:01.339 --> 01:09:03.207
Was any of it
from Foreign Intelligence...

01:09:03.209 --> 01:09:05.247
regarding my disappearance last year?

01:09:05.249 --> 01:09:06.907
Get back what was on the laptop first.

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:08.519
Foreign Intelligence first.

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:11.647
Stop the domestic team
from taking any data.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:13.587
I don't care what you must do.
Get in!

01:09:13.589 --> 01:09:15.618
Don't try to get involved anymore.

01:09:18.589 --> 01:09:21.357
The last person to get
the emergency call from Dandong.

01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:22.499
Who was it?
