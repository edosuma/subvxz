00:00.967 --> 00:03.333
My men are trained
to go into instant action.

00:03.403 --> 00:07.066
They're gunning for you, Colonel.
You're the Muhammad Ali of crime.

00:10.310 --> 00:11.436
What was that?

00:11.511 --> 00:14.742
- Why does he need a driver like me?
- That is on a need-to-know basis.

00:14.814 --> 00:16.280
There's something wrong
with this guy.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.079
This operation goes into high gear
within 12 hours.

00:19.152 --> 00:22.019
There is no time
for rivalry in the ranks.

00:24.657 --> 00:27.592
KITT, take over. I'm going out.

00:29.629 --> 00:30.926
Hang on!

00:43.376 --> 00:48.279
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:48.348 --> 00:50.407
who does not exist.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.760
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:01.828 --> 01:04.422
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.497 --> 01:06.556
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:06.633 --> 01:10.160
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.945
Yeah, we got somethin'.

02:03.022 --> 02:05.388
Whoa! Eighty miles an hour!

02:05.458 --> 02:07.983
Damn kids.
They think they own this road.

02:08.061 --> 02:12.293
One-fifty. One-ninety?

02:12.365 --> 02:14.993
Two twenty-five?
He's off the scale!

02:21.074 --> 02:22.803
Maybe it ain't a car.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.942
What was that?

02:31.017 --> 02:33.008
A Pontiac.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.654
Michael, if you want me to drive,
don't bump the controls.

02:41.728 --> 02:44.959
Just finish him off
and take the wheel.

02:54.607 --> 02:57.940
Michael, are you tying
him up again? Michael!

02:58.011 --> 03:01.003
KITT,
open the sunroof!

03:01.781 --> 03:04.272
You don't have to shout.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.738
Sorry about the accommodations,
but it's the height of the season.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.807
You understand.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.806
Hi!

05:13.079 --> 05:16.014
We were so worried. Are you
all right? Yeah, I'm okay.

05:16.082 --> 05:19.017
I had a couple bruises. How are your
shocks? Are you still in alignment?

05:19.085 --> 05:22.418
Everything is in proper order, Bonnie.
But thank you for your concern.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.422
Oh, KITT, that's sweet.

05:24.490 --> 05:28.153
But let me check anyway. Your surveillance
scanners might need adjustment.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.831
Michael.
Hello, Devon.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.605
When we didn't hear from you on schedule,
we decided to intercept you en route.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.446
What happened? Mr. Dugan got loose
about an hour after I picked him up.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.951
He jumped me
while I was driving.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.615
Well, you seem to have managed
all right. Is he secure now?

05:57.690 --> 06:02.718
Well, I locked him in that trailer you prepared, but
I still think he'd be a lot more secure in a prison.

06:02.795 --> 06:07.732
Well, in case another inmate
recognized him, he'd blow the whistle.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.860
What's this? Oh, I
found that on Mr. Dugan.

06:10.937 --> 06:13.132
Obviously,
some sort of cryptic invitation.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.174
Maybe to the Army-Navy game, huh?

06:15.241 --> 06:17.209
Michael, Kincaid
is a very clever man.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.210
I suggest you treat him seriously.

06:21.581 --> 06:24.015
Although his style
may be somewhat outrageous,

06:24.083 --> 06:26.574
his techniques,
I assure you, are deadly.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.587
Devon, it's perfectly safe.

06:29.655 --> 06:31.589
Kincaid and Dugan have never met.

06:31.657 --> 06:34.922
As far as Kincaid will know,
I'm the world-famous wheelman.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.428
I sincerely hope so.

06:37.497 --> 06:41.331
Several law enforcement agencies
and military intelligence...

06:41.401 --> 06:46.338
have tried to put an end to his
criminal career several times,

06:46.406 --> 06:51.469
and all those efforts have come to a disastrous
end for each one of the operatives concerned.

06:51.544 --> 06:54.513
Can you rephrase that?
They got knocked off.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.514
Huh?
They didn't come back.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.517
You know, I liked it better
the first way. Really?

06:59.585 --> 07:01.883
Sorry.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.987
- How's that?
- A little higher.

07:06.058 --> 07:09.289
Oh, no, lower... Stop!
That's it.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.296
I gotta get out of here.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.298
I wish you'd had
more time to prepare.

07:13.366 --> 07:16.301
I wasn't patient when I was
a cop. I'm still not patient.

07:16.369 --> 07:19.463
Michael, there is a fine line
between audacious and foolhardy.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.473
Relax, Devon.
I'll watch it.

07:21.541 --> 07:24.101
And I'll still nail Kincaid
from the inside out.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.111
You really are
quite impossible.

07:26.179 --> 07:30.309
If only Wilton Knight hadn't conceived
such an extraordinary obsession for you...

07:30.383 --> 07:33.841
- We'd both be out of a job.
- Ah.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.718
- I'll stay in touch, huh?
- Good luck.

07:37.890 --> 07:40.984
How's Frankenstein?
Ready to roll?

07:41.060 --> 07:43.995
I've increased the range
of all his scanners,

07:44.063 --> 07:46.497
and I've added
an electrical jamming device.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.727
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

07:48.801 --> 07:50.996
KITT, I think
that's your cue.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.674
As you can see, Michael,

07:56.742 --> 08:00.735
I can now disrupt electrical activity
within a range of 50 yards.

08:04.550 --> 08:07.485
KITT, I think
you've made your point.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.714
Boy, you certainly
turn him on.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.882
And off.

08:11.958 --> 08:15.894
Right now there's only one thing
wrong with this car. I know.

08:15.962 --> 08:17.896
The nut behind the wheel.

08:17.964 --> 08:21.695
That's... That's very funny.
Very funny.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.903
I wonder if there's a real woman
under those overalls...

08:27.974 --> 08:30.169
or just a robot.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.438
Under the overalls,
she is 168 centimeters tall,

08:32.511 --> 08:34.741
54 kilos in weight.

08:34.813 --> 08:37.681
Other measurements:
97 centimeters, 61...

08:37.750 --> 08:39.683
- KITT.
- Yes, Michael?

08:39.751 --> 08:41.743
Shut up.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.305
Michael?
Yes, KITT.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.002
I've been wondering about
something. Nuclear physics?

09:04.076 --> 09:09.810
No. Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't we en route
to Colonel Kincaid's current base of operations?

09:09.882 --> 09:11.816
Yeah. What about it?

09:11.884 --> 09:16.912
Unless I'm mistaken, didn't Mr. Miles say that no
law enforcement agent had ever returned from there?

09:16.989 --> 09:19.321
That's right.
I see.

09:20.459 --> 09:24.054
Do you happen to know
what happened to their cars?

09:26.232 --> 09:28.223
Go ahead. Go ahead.

09:33.873 --> 09:36.808
Michael.
Yes, KITT?

09:36.876 --> 09:40.573
- Have you considered parking me out here?
- No, KITT.

09:40.646 --> 09:43.137
I didn't think so.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.321
Hello?

10:11.010 --> 10:13.274
Mr. Dugan.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.507
We've been waiting for you.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.477
Kindly raise your hands.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.647
Hey, what is this?

10:32.898 --> 10:34.832
You're late.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.528
Since you're known for promptness,
I'm highly suspicious.

10:37.603 --> 10:39.537
What are you talking about?
I'm right on time.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.869
But one full day late.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.171
You've had it, turkey.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.518
Hold it, Thompson.
Stay put.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.713
He tends to be
a little impulsive.

10:57.623 --> 11:00.558
I'm nobody's employee, Colonel.
I'm a professional for hire.

11:00.626 --> 11:03.527
This little kangaroo court of yours
is gonna cost you an extra 10 grand.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.531
Hey! Nobody, I mean nobody
shakes down the colonel.

11:06.599 --> 11:10.592
Thompson. I think I'm capable
of handling this matter.

11:12.104 --> 11:15.232
We have a contract.
The price was set.

11:15.307 --> 11:18.174
And dance lessons
weren't a part of it.

11:18.244 --> 11:21.907
I get another 10,000,
or you get yourself another man.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.518
Very well.

11:27.586 --> 11:32.922
Linda, show our, uh, driver
to his quarters.

11:32.992 --> 11:36.120
Colonel, are we gonna
buy this bunch of lies?

11:36.195 --> 11:40.256
Thompson, we are trying to
get Mr. Dugan into the team spirit,

11:40.332 --> 11:43.267
and I would appreciate it
if you would show some.

11:43.335 --> 11:46.202
And get yourself a towel.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.972
In here.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.980
This is your room.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.983
Workout clothes are in here.
If they don't fit, please speak up.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.985
And wake up is at 6:00 a.m.

12:01.053 --> 12:04.989
Sure you don't mean 0600 hours? I
see you've heard about the colonel.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.821
I heard he doesn't know
he's been retired.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.724
What's with all this
West Point stuff?

12:09.795 --> 12:12.662
What's the caper?
Why does he need a driver like me?

12:12.732 --> 12:15.860
As our leader says,
that is on a need-to-know basis,

12:15.935 --> 12:18.927
and so far he's the only one
who needs to know.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.875
Lights out at 10:00.
That's, um...

12:23.943 --> 12:25.934
2200.

12:26.879 --> 12:31.441
Right. And if you're outside after that,
your room had better be on fire.

12:31.517 --> 12:33.451
That about covers it.
Any questions?

12:33.519 --> 12:36.147
Yeah, how about a personal one?

12:37.223 --> 12:41.455
- You mean, what's a nice girl like me doing in a racket like this?
- Well, I would've phrased it better.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.518
You'd get the same answer.

12:44.730 --> 12:48.359
I'm here because I spent too many of my
formative years with lowlife and scum.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.028
- Like Kincaid.
- Like you.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.701
KITT?

13:36.348 --> 13:40.216
Nice of you to drop in. It's also
necessary. My room was bugged.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.186
Interesting.
Should I scan the area?

13:42.254 --> 13:44.654
That's exactly
what I had in mind.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.657
It's not just your room, Michael.

13:46.725 --> 13:50.388
There are monitors all over this estate,
and every telephone line is tapped.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.397
Then we can't contact Devon
from here, can we?

13:53.465 --> 13:55.399
Not without being overheard.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.935
I estimate one-quarter mile away
would be secure. Shall we go?

13:58.003 --> 14:02.201
No, not just yet. Let's wait
till we get something definite.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.504
Maybe I can get something
from the girl.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.045
I wouldn't touch that line
with a 10-foot driveshaft.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.046
What's that supposed to mean?

14:09.114 --> 14:12.049
Merely that you always seem
to use our assignments...

14:12.117 --> 14:14.381
as convenient springboards
for your social life.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.387
Don't be ridiculous.

14:16.455 --> 14:18.252
That girl is a source of information.

14:18.324 --> 14:21.225
- That's all.
- I've heard that one before.

14:43.682 --> 14:47.277
Mr. Dugan,
since you're our latest recruit,

14:47.353 --> 14:49.617
no doubt you have
a few questions.

14:49.688 --> 14:52.623
Yes, sir, I do. I've been
wan... I'll try to fill you in.

14:52.691 --> 14:55.956
The next few days are gonna be spent
in practice, practice, practice.

14:56.028 --> 14:57.962
Without training,
without drill and practice,

14:58.030 --> 15:00.464
any military maneuver
is doomed to failure,

15:00.532 --> 15:02.966
and I do not fail.

15:06.038 --> 15:08.029
Where was I, Dugan?

15:09.041 --> 15:11.032
You don't fail.

15:12.511 --> 15:16.572
People at the Pentagon will give you an
argument about that. But then, what do they know?

15:16.649 --> 15:20.085
They gave me napalm and defoliants,
helicopter gunships,

15:20.152 --> 15:22.086
and they called me brutal.

15:22.154 --> 15:24.088
Imagine. Shocking, Colonel. Really.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.090
Yeah, indeed.

15:26.158 --> 15:29.753
One man's "brutal"
is simply another man's "efficient."

15:29.828 --> 15:33.594
And watching lesser men rise
through the ranks over the years,

15:33.666 --> 15:36.601
I learned
a very valuable lesson...

15:36.669 --> 15:41.038
the deadliest weapon in the world
is the human mind.

15:48.080 --> 15:52.346
We'll hone that weapon
to a fine edge.

15:52.418 --> 15:55.353
By the time I'm through with
you, young man, you'll cut steel.

15:55.421 --> 15:59.050
I'm looking forward to it.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.058
Excellent.

16:02.494 --> 16:05.827
Miss Elliot, your drill, please.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.707
The ball, Miss Elliot.
The ball.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.236
Always expect the unexpected.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.868
Overconfidence
can be fatal.

16:51.944 --> 16:55.778
Speaking of which, now that you're dead,
you can do without lunch and without dinner.

16:55.848 --> 17:00.182
We'll hope that your stomach
will inspire a better performance next time.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.452
He acts like he owns you. He does.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.458
Mr. Dugan?
Mr. Dugan.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.723
They call you "the driver,"
don't they?

17:10.796 --> 17:14.196
Yes, sir. It's a bit
obvious, but descriptive.

17:18.604 --> 17:22.369
All right, Mr. Dugan, I'd like to see
you and your vehicle duplicate that jump.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.238
No.

17:30.816 --> 17:34.582
Not until you move those ramps
another 20 feet apart.

17:34.653 --> 17:36.644
I like a challenge.

17:39.158 --> 17:41.092
Boys!

17:41.160 --> 17:43.651
Move Mr. Dugan's ramps
for him.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.495
Ready? Lift.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.410
Michael?
Yeah, KITT.

18:00.479 --> 18:04.438
- Do we really have to do this?
- That's why we get the big bucks, buddy.

18:04.516 --> 18:06.450
You ready?
Of course.

18:06.518 --> 18:09.078
With my rocket power thrusters,
I could do this on four cylinders.

18:09.154 --> 18:12.419
You can't use your thrusters.
We're supposed to be undercover.

18:12.491 --> 18:15.085
Do you think they could
lower the ramp?

18:18.597 --> 18:21.589
Well, that's excellent,
Mr. Dugan.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.658
That's excellent.

19:54.493 --> 19:56.757
Oww!
What are you doing?

19:56.828 --> 19:59.558
Trying to hold on
to my dinner.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.828
Since you're dead, I thought
you might like one yourself.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.902
- I don't know what to say.
- How about "thanks"?

20:11.143 --> 20:13.134
Thanks.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.307
- You don't happen to have some...
- Right here.

20:20.152 --> 20:23.781
I guess, for a change,
crime does pay.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.846
What, not always?

20:27.359 --> 20:29.350
Not for me.

20:30.829 --> 20:34.356
I guess you wouldn't know
about that, would you?

20:34.433 --> 20:38.802
We've all heard about the job
you pulled in Paris. Paris?

20:38.870 --> 20:41.202
Oh, yeah, Paris.
Well...

20:56.121 --> 20:58.646
KITT, activate the surveillance unit.

20:58.724 --> 21:01.488
- The usual routine.
- Meaning, I keep you out of trouble.

21:01.560 --> 21:05.519
- Just don't start giving yourself a
tune-up while I'm in there. - In where?

21:05.597 --> 21:09.294
Well, since the colonel
has a little boudoir labeled "off limits,"

21:09.368 --> 21:11.893
I think that's
just the place I'm going.

22:18.737 --> 22:21.433
You got trouble?

22:21.506 --> 22:23.440
That's a reasonable assumption.

22:23.508 --> 22:27.638
Two people are headed your way.
They'll enter from the hall in 15.4 seconds.

22:27.713 --> 22:30.204
I would recommend you exit
via the back door.

22:30.282 --> 22:32.273
Good thinking.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.459
The only trouble is...

22:45.530 --> 22:47.998
there is no back door.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.935
It's something I don't want to
concern myself with right now.

22:52.003 --> 22:55.632
Dugan's a phony. Oh, Thompson,
we've been through many campaigns.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.141
I trust your nerve.
I trust your loyalty.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.144
I even trust your trigger finger.

23:00.212 --> 23:03.579
But when it comes to your instincts,
that's a different matter altogether.

23:03.648 --> 23:07.709
Colonel, I'm telling you something.
There's something wrong with this guy Dugan.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.720
I don't like him.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.882
- Is there anyone you do like?
- Come on, Colonel, I'm serious.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.892
So am I.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.895
This operation goes into high gear
within 12 hours.

23:17.963 --> 23:20.261
There is no time
for rivalry in the ranks.

23:20.332 --> 23:23.199
Okay. Okay, fine.
Forget I said it.

23:23.268 --> 23:26.726
But when I turn out to be right,
there's one thing I want...

23:26.805 --> 23:29.638
This is a formal request,
I assume? You bet it is.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.699
I want him.

23:48.693 --> 23:51.821
Okay, KITT, I got the caper.

23:51.897 --> 23:55.833
In less than 12 hours, we break into the
federal penitentiary at Flint Mountain.

23:55.901 --> 23:59.928
We're going to break into a prison?
Well, that's a new one. Why?

24:00.005 --> 24:02.872
I think it's obvious.
It's a maximum-security prison.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.876
The kind of clients they got in there
would pay plenty for a ticket out.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.037
Looks like Kincaid's
playing travel agent.

24:08.113 --> 24:11.708
Michael, I believe Devon would find
this information very interesting.

24:11.783 --> 24:16.447
No kidding. But this place is bugged.
You slip out of here and contact him.

24:16.521 --> 24:18.455
Uh-oh.
Trouble?

24:18.523 --> 24:21.390
- Don't worry. I'll distract her.
- I'll bet.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.928
Go make the call.

24:31.236 --> 24:33.500
- You're breaking curfew.
- So are you.

24:33.572 --> 24:35.631
Gonna turn me in?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.637
No.

24:39.711 --> 24:42.145
As a matter of fact,
I was looking for you.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.378
Why were you wa...

26:19.544 --> 26:22.980
You don't seem to have much
faith in our employer. Do you?

26:23.048 --> 26:25.039
What's that
supposed to mean?

26:28.320 --> 26:31.255
About those nuns in Paris...
The ones at the orphanage.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.588
I told you I wasn't
responsible for that.

26:34.659 --> 26:36.650
I made that up.

26:38.797 --> 26:40.788
What?

26:44.002 --> 26:46.300
I said, I made that up.

26:47.405 --> 26:51.034
You're obviously not Dugan.
Who are you?

27:07.559 --> 27:09.550
Uh-oh.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.901
Sorry, ma'am, but there's a
tractor-trailer overturned up ahead,

27:17.969 --> 27:20.904
and we got molasses and honey
all over the highway.

27:20.972 --> 27:25.909
But if you make a U-turn, you can take
Route 13 and get back on on the next on-ramp.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.207
Well, thank you, Officer.

27:28.279 --> 27:31.476
Uh, hang a U-ie
and drive down Route 13.

27:31.549 --> 27:33.540
Uh, sorry about
the inconvenience.

27:43.595 --> 27:47.531
Sorry about the inconvenience, but, uh,
we got a tractor-trailer spill up ahead.

27:47.599 --> 27:50.534
Do you know that cutoff
on Route 13? Yes, Officer.

27:50.602 --> 27:53.298
It's 3.2 miles to the
southwest. Uh, yeah, right.

27:53.371 --> 27:55.965
Just take that
and catch the next on-ramp.

27:56.041 --> 27:58.601
Thank you, Officer.
Now, you drive careful, hear?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.668
I always do.

28:08.086 --> 28:10.020
Hey! Come back!

28:10.088 --> 28:12.022
Stop!

28:12.090 --> 28:14.524
What's wrong?
That car! That's the car!

28:14.592 --> 28:17.026
The one that went like...

28:17.095 --> 28:19.029
Over up high!

28:19.097 --> 28:23.227
Damn! Did you get a good
look at the driver? Yeah, I...

28:34.512 --> 28:36.742
Michael Knight.
That's a nice name.

28:36.815 --> 28:38.749
Getting used to it.

28:38.817 --> 28:43.379
You know, I was hoping you might tell
me a little bit more than just your name.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.514
When we know each other better.

28:45.590 --> 28:47.581
I mean, the ambience here...

28:48.393 --> 28:50.384
I'll break the ice.

28:51.663 --> 28:54.154
I'm not like the other people here.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.167
Kincaid's paying them.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.001
With me,
it's a different relationship.

29:07.112 --> 29:09.103
He's blackmailing me.

29:14.552 --> 29:18.488
Five years ago I was a champion gymnast
at an ivy-covered school.

29:18.556 --> 29:20.547
You'd know the name.

29:22.193 --> 29:26.186
But what I didn't know was that my father
was paying my tuition with dirty money.

29:27.966 --> 29:30.958
Eventually, he got caught
with his hand in the till.

29:32.103 --> 29:35.539
The trial didn't go well with him.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.542
He got very sick.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.101
He didn't want to go to prison.

29:42.213 --> 29:45.478
So, when I got on the stand
I said all the right things.

29:47.852 --> 29:50.844
Within a week, my father did die.

29:51.856 --> 29:53.847
But he was a free man,

29:55.393 --> 29:57.554
thanks to my convenient lie.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.629
At least that's what I called it.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.895
But Kincaid called it perjury.

30:06.137 --> 30:11.074
And he said that I would end up
in prison if I didn't help him.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.576
Well, he's got a point.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.079
But if you help me
nail Kincaid,

30:16.147 --> 30:19.082
I think the courts
will see things your way.

30:19.150 --> 30:22.085
Help you how? We gotta
catch Kincaid red-handed.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.088
If the caper doesn't go down,
neither does he.

30:25.156 --> 30:28.091
If you and I stay
in the colonel's little army,

30:28.159 --> 30:31.322
he'll get the prison sentence,
Linda, not you.

30:35.633 --> 30:37.624
Yes.

30:41.706 --> 30:44.732
Dune buggies?
Beanie bags?

30:44.809 --> 30:47.004
No, bean bags.

30:47.078 --> 30:49.603
A beanie is
a small head covering which...

30:49.681 --> 30:51.546
Yes, I can speak English, KITT.

30:51.616 --> 30:53.550
Yes, sir, and splendidly.

30:53.618 --> 30:56.553
You tell me that they are
attacking a prison?

30:56.621 --> 31:01.490
Yes, sir. Flint Mountain Federal
Penitentiary in 10 hours and 38 minutes.

31:01.559 --> 31:04.027
Yes, it's unbelievable.

31:04.095 --> 31:06.029
It's absolutely unbelievable.

31:06.097 --> 31:08.031
And Michael is
quite certain of this?

31:08.099 --> 31:12.798
I am, sir. Would you like me to give you a
40-point, cross-indexed statistical readout?

31:12.871 --> 31:14.805
Good Lord, no,
it's 2:00 a.m.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.808
2:02 a.m, to be exact.
Thank you.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.470
All right, KITT.
I'll deal with it.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.878
Tell Michael we'll be ready
and tell him "good show."

31:23.948 --> 31:27.315
And you too, KITT.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.580
Thank you, sir.
KITT signing off.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.589
Thank God.

31:40.031 --> 31:42.022
Okay, go.

31:44.002 --> 31:47.267
I trust you, and I know this is
gonna work. I'm glad one of us knows.

31:47.338 --> 31:49.329
Go, go, go, go.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.149
Well,
what was that all about?

31:59.217 --> 32:01.412
Biology.
Oh, that.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.920
- Did you call Devon?
- I certainly did.

32:03.988 --> 32:06.980
Michael, we've got them
right where we want them.

32:08.526 --> 32:11.927
Okay, you hold on
to that thought, huh?

32:36.287 --> 32:38.278
Yes?

32:44.262 --> 32:46.196
Excuse me, Colonel.
Yes.

32:46.264 --> 32:49.256
I just captured an intruder
by the north wall.

32:50.735 --> 32:53.670
Intruder?
What'd you do with him?

32:53.738 --> 32:56.901
He's out cold.
I put him in the basement cell.

32:58.943 --> 33:00.934
When he comes to, call me.

33:03.448 --> 33:08.647
It's been a long time
since I interrogated anyone.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.985
Gentlemen and lady,

33:12.056 --> 33:15.992
you've all been waiting very patiently
to learn our ultimate objective.

33:16.060 --> 33:19.188
Well, now is the time.

33:19.263 --> 33:23.256
I assure you.
You're going to be very pleasantly surprised.

33:25.103 --> 33:28.004
Interesting,
this little operation?

33:32.677 --> 33:34.668
For some other time.

33:35.913 --> 33:37.847
This.

33:37.915 --> 33:39.940
Within a matter of three hours,

33:40.018 --> 33:45.786
we're going to use every skill, every move,
every technique we have practiced,

33:45.857 --> 33:49.452
and we are going to steal...

33:49.527 --> 33:52.792
$12 million in gold.

33:53.998 --> 33:58.367
Now, if you listen carefully, I'll explain
each and every step of the operation.

34:05.610 --> 34:08.545
Of course, it's very short notice,
Mr. Miles,

34:08.612 --> 34:12.606
but my men are trained
to go into instant action.

34:14.252 --> 34:17.744
"A" Team, position
to repel assault. Arch!

34:18.989 --> 34:21.857
"B" Team, position
for cover fire. Arch!

34:23.694 --> 34:26.629
Very impressive, Warden.
Thank you.

34:42.380 --> 34:46.214
This is the moment
we've all been training for.

34:48.386 --> 34:51.321
This is the ultimate test
of our will,

34:51.389 --> 34:53.322
our courage,

34:53.391 --> 34:55.985
our fine cutting edge.

34:56.060 --> 34:57.994
Regardless of the outcome,

34:58.062 --> 35:00.963
I want you to know
that I personally am proud...

35:01.032 --> 35:03.967
to have served with
each and every one of you,

35:04.035 --> 35:07.027
and I'll be with you
every step of the way.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.831
You have your maps,
your communicators.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.978
Good hunting.

35:15.046 --> 35:18.015
And good luck.

35:18.082 --> 35:20.016
All right, Thompson,
move 'em out.

35:20.084 --> 35:23.281
All right!
You heard the colonel! Go!

35:28.493 --> 35:31.929
KITT, we gotta call Devon as soon
as we're secured. Why? What's wrong?

35:31.996 --> 35:33.930
Because we're robbing
a gold shipment.

35:33.998 --> 35:36.432
That's alarming.
What do you suggest we do?

35:36.501 --> 35:38.435
You're the computer.
You figure it out.

35:38.503 --> 35:40.494
I think we're in trouble.

35:51.516 --> 35:53.916
All right, everyone, listen closely.

35:53.985 --> 35:58.820
You've been briefed on the convoy
and its defenses to protect the gold.

35:58.890 --> 36:03.224
If you follow my instructions to the letter,
they'll present no problems.

36:04.228 --> 36:06.856
But remember,

36:06.931 --> 36:10.094
the monitoring device attached
to the bullion truck wheels...

36:10.168 --> 36:13.695
will be activated if the truck
stops for any reason.

36:15.473 --> 36:20.035
That device will alert law enforcement
officers within a 50-mile radius.

36:20.111 --> 36:24.445
Therefore, we must execute this
operation while it is moving...

36:24.515 --> 36:28.781
without any of them
realizing that we're doing it.

36:28.853 --> 36:32.448
All right, Baker, Waldorf,
get ready.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.185
We'll need a copy
of all the convoy transmissions.

36:44.635 --> 36:46.296
Convoy, this is Midas.

36:46.370 --> 36:49.305
We're on schedule
and approaching checkpoint 19.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.773
Request status check.

36:51.842 --> 36:54.174
Midas, this is Front Door.
All clear.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.971
Midas, this is Back Door.
All clear.

36:58.983 --> 37:01.247
Roger, Back Door.
Condition: Green.

37:01.319 --> 37:03.253
Repeat. Condition: Green.

37:03.321 --> 37:05.653
Maintain normal status.

37:08.025 --> 37:11.791
All right, everyone, take up
your positions. Deploy, deploy.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.525
Well, what are we waiting for? With
all this, you must have a phone in here.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.528
I do, but Kincaid will monitor
any calls we make.

37:45.596 --> 37:48.531
We gotta go along with the robbery
until we think of something else.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.693
Well, what about last night?
I thought you had a plan.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.760
So did I.

37:58.509 --> 38:00.443
Colonel, this is Waldorf.

38:00.511 --> 38:03.207
I have the convoy in sight.
They're passing my position now.

38:03.281 --> 38:07.479
All right, you know what to do.
Knock out that rear jeep.

38:36.380 --> 38:39.247
Bingo, Colonel.
They're sleeping like babies.

38:40.785 --> 38:44.277
They'll be out for hours.
I'm taking their position in the convoy.

38:44.355 --> 38:46.846
Baker, Clark, snap to it.

38:56.467 --> 39:00.494
Convoy, this is Midas.
We have just passed checkpoint 20.

39:03.240 --> 39:07.233
Repeat. We have just passed
checkpoint 20. Doors report, over.

39:08.679 --> 39:12.342
Midas, this is Front Door.
All clear. Condition: Green. Over.

39:12.416 --> 39:14.509
Roger, Front Door.

39:15.619 --> 39:17.951
Back Door, please report.

39:20.157 --> 39:21.715
Back Door, do you read?

39:22.893 --> 39:25.123
Baker, Clark, what's happening?

39:25.196 --> 39:27.357
Come on! Come on!

39:30.201 --> 39:32.294
Back Door,
request status check.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.304
Back Door, do you read?

39:34.372 --> 39:37.068
Back Door, do you read?

39:37.141 --> 39:40.372
This is Back Door. This is Back Door.

39:42.179 --> 39:44.977
Roger, Back Door.
Request status check.

39:45.049 --> 39:48.485
Midas, this is Back Door.
All clear. Over.

39:48.552 --> 39:50.952
Midas, this is Front Door.
Request status check.

39:51.021 --> 39:54.457
Hey, Front Door, this is Midas.
We are A-okay all the way.

39:54.525 --> 39:56.459
Condition: Green.

39:56.527 --> 39:59.121
Roger, Midas.
Good work. Over and out.

39:59.196 --> 40:01.960
All right, Mr. Dugan,
Miss Elliot.

40:02.032 --> 40:04.330
It is up to you.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.700
KITT, take over.
I'm going out.

41:49.773 --> 41:52.674
- Affirmative, Michael. Do you think that's safe?
- Of course not.

41:55.946 --> 41:57.937
Hang on!

41:59.783 --> 42:01.944
Who's got the car?

42:02.019 --> 42:03.953
It's okay!
I got you! I got you!

42:04.021 --> 42:06.251
Who's got the car?
Oh! Ohh!

42:17.535 --> 42:20.197
Dugan, Elliot, what's going on?
Report.

42:22.273 --> 42:24.468
You all right?
I think it's sprained.

42:25.776 --> 42:30.110
Kincaid, this is Dugan. We got a problem.
Linda is hurt. She can't get in the truck.

42:30.180 --> 42:33.308
All right, then let her drive
and you go out.

42:33.384 --> 42:37.821
- Could you do it?
- If I don't do it, we can't bust him.

42:37.888 --> 42:41.551
If we don't bust him,
I can't help you in court.

42:43.727 --> 42:46.719
Kincaid, this is Dugan.
We're still on.

42:47.598 --> 42:49.759
Excellent. Excellent.

43:17.061 --> 43:19.825
Kincaid, this is Dugan.
I'm inside.

43:19.897 --> 43:21.831
That's excellent, excellent.

43:21.899 --> 43:25.767
All right, Miss Elliot,
drop back about three feet.

43:35.713 --> 43:38.648
- Miss Elliot, do you read me?
- Uh, yeah.

43:38.716 --> 43:40.650
It's all taken care of.

43:40.718 --> 43:42.652
Mr. Dugan,

43:42.720 --> 43:45.120
empty that truck.

44:51.655 --> 44:54.419
Bravo, team. Bravo.

44:54.491 --> 44:58.086
All right, all of you
rendezvous at headquarters.

44:58.162 --> 45:00.596
Thompson and I
will linger just a bit...

45:00.664 --> 45:02.598
to humor the convoy.

45:05.969 --> 45:09.735
Colonel, since your gear is packed
and stowed, could we move out now, sir?

45:09.807 --> 45:12.002
No, no, not just yet.

45:12.076 --> 45:14.010
Not just yet.

45:14.078 --> 45:16.069
Mr. Dugan.

45:19.216 --> 45:21.150
Yes, sir?
No.

45:21.218 --> 45:23.152
No, not you.

45:23.220 --> 45:25.450
The real Mr. Dugan.

45:33.797 --> 45:37.563
Mr. Dugan and I had a conversation
this morning, Mr. Knight.

45:37.634 --> 45:41.400
I didn't want to distract you from your
duties today by discussing it with you.

45:41.472 --> 45:44.737
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful.

45:44.808 --> 45:46.799
Good-bye, hotshot.

45:47.811 --> 45:50.109
I'm sorry about this, son.

45:50.180 --> 45:51.909
I really like you.

45:51.982 --> 45:55.440
Yeah? Personally,
I thought you were a jerk.

45:56.720 --> 46:00.281
Kincaid, we've been had!
It's just lead covered with gold paint!

46:00.357 --> 46:03.190
Lead?
What are you talking about?

46:03.260 --> 46:06.286
I don't believe it!

46:07.598 --> 46:10.089
KITT! Aaah!

46:15.239 --> 46:18.367
Get in there!

46:31.455 --> 46:34.322
Freeze!

46:48.939 --> 46:51.237
First thing in the morning, huh?

46:51.308 --> 46:53.242
Right?
Right.

46:53.310 --> 46:56.006
Unimpeachable source.
Right?

46:57.080 --> 46:59.071
Did I really say that?

47:04.755 --> 47:07.747
Michael! Where in
the name of heaven have you...

47:10.761 --> 47:13.491
Hello, Devon.
Sorry about the misunderstanding.

47:13.564 --> 47:15.998
"Misunderstanding"?
Do you realize what you've done?

47:17.067 --> 47:19.900
You've caused me
a great deal of difficulty.

47:19.970 --> 47:21.961
You've embarrassed me.
You've...

47:26.643 --> 47:29.976
Devon, I'd like you
to meet Colonel Kincaid.

47:32.616 --> 47:35.414
You've saved me
a great deal of paperwork.

47:52.102 --> 47:55.594
One man can make a difference,
Michael.

48:00.577 --> 48:04.604
Michael Knight, a lone crusader
in a dangerous world,

48:04.681 --> 48:07.377
the world of the Knight Rider.
