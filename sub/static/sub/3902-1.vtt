00:25.317 --> 00:27.819
- So, your boy's name is what?
- Snot.

00:29.238 --> 00:32.240
- You called the guy Snot?
- Snotboogie, yeah.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.952
"Snotboogie"? He like the name?

00:36.286 --> 00:37.995
- What?
- Snotboogie.

00:41.291 --> 00:45.294
This kid whose mama went to the trouble
of christening him Omar Isaiah Betts?

00:46.296 --> 00:48.923
You know, he forgets his jacket...

00:50.843 --> 00:54.387
so his nose starts running,
and some asshole,

00:54.471 --> 00:56.973
instead of giving him a Kleenex,
calls him "Snot".

00:58.517 --> 01:00.518
So, he's "Snot" forever.

01:02.604 --> 01:06.149
- Doesn't seem fair.
- Life just be that way, I guess.

01:08.152 --> 01:11.237
So, who shot Snot?

01:11.530 --> 01:13.156
I ain't going in no court.

01:21.874 --> 01:25.251
- Motherfucker ain't have to put no cap in him.
- Definitely not.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.212
He coulda just whipped his ass,
like we always do.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.131
- I agree.
- He gonna kill Snot.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.134
Snot been doing the same shit
since I don't know how long.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.553
Kill a man over some bullshit.

01:38.807 --> 01:42.143
I'm saying, every Friday night

01:42.519 --> 01:43.936
in the alley behind the cut-rate,

01:44.021 --> 01:45.438
we rolling bones.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.732
All the boys from here, we roll till late.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.484
Alley crap game, right?

01:49.860 --> 01:51.486
And like every time,

01:51.862 --> 01:54.489
Snot, he'd fade a few shooters.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.074
Play it out till the pot's deep.

01:57.493 --> 01:58.951
Then he'd snatch and run.

02:00.871 --> 02:01.954
Every time?

02:02.289 --> 02:03.664
Couldn't help hisself.

02:04.875 --> 02:09.294
Let me understand you. Every Friday night,
you and your boys would shoot crap, right?

02:09.713 --> 02:12.048
And every Friday night,
your pal Snotboogie...

02:12.758 --> 02:16.719
he'd wait till there was cash on the ground,
then grab the money and run away?

02:17.262 --> 02:18.262
You let him do that?

02:18.722 --> 02:20.389
We catch him and beat his ass.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.766
But ain't nobody ever go past that.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.229
I gotta ask you.

02:27.064 --> 02:30.608
If every time Snotboogie
would grab the money and run away...

02:32.820 --> 02:34.487
why'd you even let him in the game?

02:34.571 --> 02:35.613
What?

02:35.739 --> 02:39.826
If Snotboogie always stole the money,
why'd you let him play?

02:40.744 --> 02:43.579
Got to. This America, man.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.639
If you walk through the garden

03:02.432 --> 03:04.809
You better watch your back

03:06.395 --> 03:09.689
Well, I beg your pardon

03:09.773 --> 03:12.608
Walk the straight and narrow track

03:14.403 --> 03:16.612
If you walk with Jesus

03:17.406 --> 03:19.282
He'll save your soul

03:22.244 --> 03:24.662
You gotta keep the devil

03:26.290 --> 03:28.291
Down in the hole

03:29.251 --> 03:31.878
All the angels sing

03:32.629 --> 03:35.131
About Jesus' mighty sword

03:36.550 --> 03:38.843
And they shield you with their wings

03:40.220 --> 03:44.181
Keep you close to the Lord

03:44.266 --> 03:46.851
Don't pay heed to temptation

03:47.895 --> 03:51.731
For his hands are so cold

03:51.815 --> 03:54.859
You gotta keep the devil

03:54.943 --> 03:58.863
Way down in the hole

04:06.872 --> 04:09.415
Way down in the hole

04:10.792 --> 04:13.336
Way down in the hole

04:14.713 --> 04:18.298
Way down in the hole

04:18.382 --> 04:21.010
Way down in the hole

04:28.518 --> 04:30.186
- Guess what he said.
- What?

04:30.270 --> 04:35.483
- "Gotta let him play, this America."
- No fucking way. He give you the shooter?

04:35.567 --> 04:38.653
Three Newports and a Grape Nehi
he's grand juried. It's down, Bunk.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.821
Barksdale's in Part 12, right?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.615
Project murder, Westside.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.742
- Which one, now?
- Never mind.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.204
- Let's sit in on it for a bit.
- Where you gonna be?

04:48.538 --> 04:51.040
I'm gonna drop this off on Nathan,
then I'm going to the office.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.085
Don't answer no phones, Bunk.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.298
Is that your signature
on that photo array card?

04:59.675 --> 05:01.008
Yes.

05:01.093 --> 05:05.221
- And your initials, next to the photo?
- Yes.

05:06.056 --> 05:10.977
Mr. Gant, do you see the man
you identified from that photo array card...

05:11.603 --> 05:13.729
sitting in the courtroom today?

05:26.910 --> 05:28.077
He's right there.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.707
For the record, the witness has identified
the defendant, D'Angelo Barksdale.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.419
- Your witness.
- Thank you.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.089
Just one question, Mr. Gant.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.009
Had you ever seen this young man
before the day in question?

05:46.555 --> 05:47.930
No, no.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.434
No further questions, your honor.

05:52.936 --> 05:56.772
You're excused, Mr. Gant.
Call your next witness.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.276
State calls Nakeisha Lyles,
your honor.

06:13.623 --> 06:17.835
Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

06:17.961 --> 06:19.128
I do.

06:22.424 --> 06:26.093
- Can you state your name, please?
- Nakeisha Lyles.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.055
- And are you employed?
- Yes, I am.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.683
- And what is your occupation, Ms. Lyles?
- I'm a security guard.

06:33.351 --> 06:37.480
And were you employed as a security guard
on May 4th, the day of the shooting?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.356
Uh-huh.

06:39.441 --> 06:43.110
- What were your duties on that date?
- I was in the booth of 221.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.990
The guard booth in the lobby
of the Fremont Avenue high-rise?

06:48.325 --> 06:49.575
Yes.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.329
Behind bulletproof glass,
with a clear view of the lobby?

06:53.663 --> 06:55.247
- Yeah.
- Good.

06:56.708 --> 07:00.336
Ms. Lyles, I know this may be difficult,
but can you tell us what you saw?

07:01.338 --> 07:04.423
Erm, a man, he was waiting for the elevator,

07:04.508 --> 07:07.218
when another man just
starts beating on him...

07:07.511 --> 07:10.429
and like, the one man,
he got knocked down...

07:10.514 --> 07:13.724
- The victim?
- No, the man with the gun.

07:14.226 --> 07:16.727
The man
who was knocked down had a gun.

07:17.813 --> 07:21.023
And do you see that man
in the courtroom today?

07:26.905 --> 07:28.030
Nope.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.575
Excuse me?

07:34.746 --> 07:35.746
He ain't here.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.376
You don't...?

07:41.753 --> 07:43.045
You testified.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.426
Do you remember when Detective
Barlow showed you this photo array?

07:50.053 --> 07:51.095
Yeah.

07:51.346 --> 07:55.808
Good. I call your attention to your initials
which identify this photo

07:56.434 --> 07:58.644
as the man who shot Mr. Blanchard.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.356
Did you write your initials
above that photograph?

08:06.695 --> 08:08.612
He ain't the one that did the shooting.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.781
But you identified him.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.450
He looked like the boy that did it.

08:13.743 --> 08:17.413
See, the one that did it,
I saw him come in the building a week later.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.001
You saw someone else
you thought did the shooting?

08:22.711 --> 08:24.461
Right, a week later.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.841
Hm. Ms. Lyles, when you spoke
with the detectives

08:28.925 --> 08:33.220
- you never said anything about...
- I tried. I called Detective...

08:34.972 --> 08:41.729
erm...Yeah, Detective Barlow
on May 13th at 2pm.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.649
- But he didn't call me back.
- Nicely done.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.611
- You called Detective Barlow?
- Yeah, twice.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.822
Yeah, I wrote it down in the log.

08:53.575 --> 08:57.077
- I need a price for pressure-treated.
- '$14.'

08:57.329 --> 08:59.914
That's the price that
you were going to quote me?

09:00.665 --> 09:04.710
Do you feel that, Mikey?
That is my fucking dick in your ear.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.297
- 'Oh, that's nice.'
- Hang on, you fucking thief. What's up?

09:08.632 --> 09:09.965
You been down the hall?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.384
- What?
- Your case just hit the wall.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.094
Barksdale's crew, they turned it.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.348
Two eyewitnesses and a statement.
No fucking way, pal.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.645
You listen to me, you little shit,
there is no way in hell I am paying that.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.191
You use my car
to chauffeur that dusty bitch.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.318
- Yo, ease up.
- You don't understand.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.988
- I did it for that man and he do this.
- Getting heated ain't gonna help.

09:33.657 --> 09:37.576
- 'Greggs, what's she saying?'
- It ain't what she says.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.453
'Yeah? What do you say?'

09:39.663 --> 09:42.498
I say we wait, shithead.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.419
- That's him.
- All right, easy, girl.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.381
- Yo, Herc, you got that?
- 'Yeah, we see.'

09:50.465 --> 09:51.674
Are the uniforms on the horn?

09:51.758 --> 09:52.758
'They're on hold.'

09:52.842 --> 09:53.842
That's Ghost.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.594
All right, good, Tiff.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.388
Now tell me what I'm seeing.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.848
- He gonna get little Mike.
- Then what?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.850
Mike come back with the money.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.772
Wait on the drop,
take the car when it's deep in the block.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.941
I don't want no foot chase.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.276
'Copy.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.072
'Got it.'

10:15.865 --> 10:18.367
Go, go, go. The driver's mine.

10:20.245 --> 10:21.620
Get the house on the left.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.623
Get back. Get on the ground. Get down.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.252
- Put your hands behind your head.
- Get your hands up.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.838
Shut the engine.
Get that motherfucker round the corner.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.966
Hand the keys out.
Drop the keys out of the car.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.969
Drop them down. Get out of the car.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.682
Get down right here, right here. Get down.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.601
Passenger, put your hands
out of the window.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.730
Both hands out of the car window.
Use your right hand, open the door.

10:48.857 --> 10:52.067
Slowly. Step out of the car.
Step out of the car!

10:52.861 --> 10:54.945
- Down on the ground.
- Don't move.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.030
Down on the ground.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.910
That's it, take his ass to jail.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.746
- You got him, Carv?
- I got him.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.084
- Look at this shit.
- Cross your legs.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.131
Look at this.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.384
You see what he did?
Do you see what he did?!

11:17.844 --> 11:20.846
Why he throw the gun on my car?
Shit gonna scratch the paint!

11:20.930 --> 11:24.016
- Stay in the car.
- Tell him to leave my car be!

11:24.100 --> 11:26.935
- Stay in the fucking car.
- That shit just ain't right.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.188
Whatcha doing with something like that?

11:30.273 --> 11:31.523
What you got here?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.778
Shoulda seen the way
this bitch was looking at me, Kima.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.781
Ugly little fucker almost shit his pants
he was so scared.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.200
Right?

11:52.337 --> 11:54.213
Two guns, remember?

11:55.757 --> 11:58.384
- Two?
- It's all good, Kima, ease up.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.477
All rise.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.481
Part 12 of the Circuit Court
of Baltimore City is now in session.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.525
Be seated.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.487
Madame Forelady,
you have a unanimous verdict?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.659
As to the defendant
D'Angelo Barksdale,

12:23.743 --> 12:26.829
how say you to the charge of murder
in the first degree?

12:27.330 --> 12:28.705
Not guilty.

12:29.541 --> 12:32.668
How say you to the charge of murder
in the second degree?

12:34.003 --> 12:36.797
- Not guilty.
- Yes! Whoo!

12:37.090 --> 12:39.091
Be seated.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.719
- It's you, daddy, yeah!
- Order.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.013
- At least you made 'em work for it.
- Be seated.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.810
The jury is to be thanked
for its services in this case.

12:50.645 --> 12:54.106
Deputies will return
defendant Barksdale to pre-trial

12:54.190 --> 12:56.275
for processing prior to his release.

13:04.242 --> 13:07.995
Think I give a fuck?
I'll be chalking you off one night.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.583
- You have a nice day.
- Yo, Stringer, let's go.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.050
Detective?

13:23.428 --> 13:24.720
Detective?

13:25.889 --> 13:28.223
Detective. Judge asked to speak with you.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.273
- What the hell happened out there?
- We lost.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.193
- Were you on this?
- The case?

13:39.861 --> 13:42.404
No, it was Barlow,
with an assist from McLarney.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.406
If it was Barlow's case,
why are you in court?

13:45.408 --> 13:46.450
No reason.

13:47.076 --> 13:51.246
You just like coming to court on murders
you don't work? For the thrill of it?

13:52.832 --> 13:56.919
When you start coming with the customers,
it's time to get out of the business.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.421
You shouldn't talk dirty now you're a judge.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.216
Now I'm a judge,
I can say anything I damn please.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.928
That Barksdale kid,
he's a cousin to Avon Barksdale.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.307
- Who?
- Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.602
The crew that's been running
Franklin Terrace.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.187
Stringer Bell?

14:15.271 --> 14:19.358
In court with the legal pad and glasses,
scaring the shit out of every witness.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.611
Him and his crew -
Wee-Bey, Savino, Stinkum.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.864
- I saw them.
- You think about clearing the court?

14:26.115 --> 14:29.243
On what basis?
It's an open court in a free nation of laws.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.911
I thought it was Baltimore.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.207
Barksdale has five out of seven

14:35.291 --> 14:36.708
towers in the Terrace.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.794
That's ten stairwells in five high-rises,

14:38.878 --> 14:40.587
going 24/7 for dope and coke.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.506
That's just the towers.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.008
The low-rises, corners, they're his too.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.760
How do you know?

14:48.012 --> 14:50.055
- Everybody knows.
- "Everybody"?

14:50.265 --> 14:51.848
Everybody on the Westside.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.937
Barksdale and Bell, they're the new power.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.815
They've dropped
10 or 12 bodies in as many months.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.693
Beat three cases in court
doing the same thing.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.195
- Who's working on them?
- In the department?

15:07.323 --> 15:08.657
Nobody, really.

15:10.535 --> 15:14.621
We're a little busy doing street rips.
Community policing and all that.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.624
So, if it's not your case, why do you care?

15:19.836 --> 15:21.545
Who said I did?

15:28.886 --> 15:31.263
One more time. One more time.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.516
Stop playing...

15:36.561 --> 15:38.312
Fuck me.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.650
You got submission numbers for the ECU?

15:43.735 --> 15:45.360
- Nope.
- Get 'em.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.573
- Why me?
- You want the collar, do the submissions.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.826
- You giving me the start?
- It's your turn.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.703
What's the extension for ECU?

15:55.830 --> 15:57.706
Do I look like your bitch?

15:58.333 --> 16:01.084
- We taking the Mercedes?
- No, I promised my girl.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.170
Car's in her name.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.422
Narcotics.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.467
- Lieutenant. Line two.
- Here you go.

16:08.551 --> 16:11.553
- Fuck me, I cannot type.
- Who the fuck can?

16:12.263 --> 16:15.599
Millennium gone, and we still
fuck around with Smith Corona.

16:15.850 --> 16:19.394
We need them computers.
They promised to train us a year ago.

16:19.604 --> 16:23.398
What would an ignorant motherfucker
like you do with a computer?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.985
- Trade stocks and shit.
- Jerk off, you mean.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.656
We get them computers hooked up,
Herc'll be deep into some porn

16:30.740 --> 16:34.159
and Kima'll still be bangin' out
her 24s on that old piece of shit.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.161
- Gotta go upstairs.
- What's up?

16:36.245 --> 16:37.913
Deputy's throwing some piss-fit.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.083
- Major know?
- He's up there now.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.379
With a mouthful of piss, probably.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.964
Our major don't know what that tastes like?

16:48.216 --> 16:51.218
It's the chain-of-command,
the shit rolls downhill.

16:51.636 --> 16:55.013
- Motherfucker, we talking about piss.
- Piss does too, think about it.

16:55.264 --> 16:58.850
- Shit rolls, piss trickles.
- Downhill, though.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.560
You don't know that for sure...

17:00.645 --> 17:03.355
Not to change the subject
on you two charmers,

17:03.439 --> 17:06.358
- but why are there only two ECU numbers?
- Dope and guns.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.777
Two guns, right?

17:09.444 --> 17:11.363
- That's three.
- Fuck it, Kima.

17:11.446 --> 17:14.616
You want a job done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.205
He means we are an effective deterrent
on the war on drugs

17:21.290 --> 17:24.417
- when we are on the street.
- Fucking motherfuckers up.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.670
- Indeed.
- Fuck the paperwork.

17:27.003 --> 17:28.505
Collect bodies, split heads.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.966
- Split them wide.
- The Western District way.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.594
- Aye.
- You heroic motherfuckers kill me.

17:35.304 --> 17:39.808
Fighting the war on drugs,
one brutality case at a time.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.352
Girl, you can't call this shit a war.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.480
- Why not?
- Wars end.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.112
You gonna write that down?

17:58.661 --> 18:02.080
How happy am I to see my pager go off
with your call number?

18:02.165 --> 18:05.751
Smoke 'em if you got 'em because
this motherfucker is as ripe as they get.

18:05.835 --> 18:09.212
- We aren't up, Nolan's squad is up.
- I know.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.214
But you answered the fucking phone.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.342
- Got to pay down my credit cards.
- Not off him.

18:14.427 --> 18:18.263
- I leave you alone, what do you do?
- All right, I heard you.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.223
Say the words, Bunk.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.350
- Come on, man.
- Speak to me.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.812
So, you gonna cut and run on the Bunk?
That shit ain't right, Jimmy.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.317
All right, then, this is my case. My file.

18:30.568 --> 18:34.696
This shit comes back a murder, you ain't gotta
do shit but stand there and laugh.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.156
You happy now, bitch?

18:36.365 --> 18:39.326
This'll teach you to give a fuck
when it ain't your turn.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.536
It ain't even gonna be a murder.

18:41.704 --> 18:45.332
This motherfucker probably came in
to take a shit and just fell out.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.125
I bet there's nothing to it.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.002
- You hope.
- Where you going?

18:50.713 --> 18:53.089
Back to the office, where I belong.

18:56.886 --> 19:01.389
You moldering motherfucker, don't even
think about coming back a murder.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.892
Don't even think of that shit.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.899
By tomorrow, Lieutenant. Don't fail me.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.534
Major's pissed.

19:20.618 --> 19:24.287
He should be. He didn't have answers
for the deputy's questions.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.374
- About what?
- Avon Barksdale.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.000
Who?

19:30.419 --> 19:33.922
- That's what I said.
- Who the fuck is Avon Barksdale?

19:34.590 --> 19:36.883
According to the right honorable
Judge Phelan,

19:36.968 --> 19:39.761
a Westside player who indulges
in the occasional murder.

19:41.764 --> 19:45.475
Now, as of today, I never heard of
Mr. Barksdale, but by tomorrow...

19:48.896 --> 19:51.022
All right, what do we know?

19:51.274 --> 19:53.692
The judge says
he has the Westside high-rises.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.443
The Terrace, mostly.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.989
- Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.
- Maybe so.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.495
- It's gotta be tonight?
- Major wants it filed by morning.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.628
Call Andrews at DEA.
See what they have on this mope.

20:13.963 --> 20:18.133
- What about Homicide?
- Homicide major was in the meeting.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.927
His people will be scrambling
to get something, too.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.889
I doubt they'll be willing to share.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.936
Barksdale, Avon.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.230
Got a DOB?

20:45.953 --> 20:49.247
- Jay.
- Where the fuck you been all day?

20:49.332 --> 20:53.335
Drinking, crack smoking.
Whoring myself on the streets of Baltimore.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.171
OK. Just so you have an excuse.

20:56.547 --> 20:59.215
But your fuck of a partner caught a call.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.344
- Yeah, I saw him out there.
- Yeah, what'd he get?

21:02.803 --> 21:05.931
- Decomp in a vacant apartment.
- Fuck.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.934
Nolan's squad was up, that one's theirs.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.311
It's a decomp.
It may come back a natural death.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.439
- You think?
- In the Poe Homes, no fucking way.

21:14.565 --> 21:17.567
Hold up. Major wants to talk to you
before you roll out.

21:17.652 --> 21:21.321
- What about?
- Fuck should I know, I'm only your sergeant.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.665
Sit the fuck down, Detective.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.417
Something wrong?

21:36.337 --> 21:38.296
Put your ass in the chair.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.604
You see these, McNulty, you see them?
These are for you.

21:54.939 --> 21:58.483
These are for you
for as long as it takes me to get even.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.235
Major, what...?

22:00.319 --> 22:04.864
Don't "Major" me,
you backstabbing, smartass piece of shit.

22:05.908 --> 22:08.118
What the fuck you doing
at the courthouse?

22:08.202 --> 22:10.996
Why the fuck are you talking
to some shitbag judge?

22:14.041 --> 22:15.917
These are for you, McNulty.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.462
This one over here
is going up your narrow fucking Irish ass.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.298
And this bad boy is in your fucking eye.

22:22.675 --> 22:26.469
I'm answering questions about
some project nigger I never heard of

22:26.554 --> 22:28.555
who's beat my unit out of ten murders.

22:28.639 --> 22:33.226
- Three. They only beat three in court.
- I got the deputy asking about ten.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.354
No, they did ten,
we only charged them with three.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.565
You're full of shit.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.275
Sir, you can check the files.

22:40.693 --> 22:44.404
Maurice Scroggins,
Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.

22:44.822 --> 22:48.783
The girl they found in the stairwell
in Saratoga, Collette something.

22:49.285 --> 22:50.660
Major, these guys are real.

22:50.745 --> 22:54.581
They beat me up on the Gerard Bogue case
just like they did Barlow.

22:56.125 --> 22:59.711
Scroggins? I don't have
an H-file on Scroggins.

22:59.795 --> 23:03.381
He was last year, summer. Two in
the back of the head, low-rise courtyard.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.343
Let me understand something.

23:08.095 --> 23:11.931
You are having the deputy
bust my balls over a prior-year case?

23:13.100 --> 23:16.519
Is this what I need from you,
you insubordinate little fuck?

23:17.438 --> 23:19.314
Major, I'm really sorry.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.358
Phelan, he and I, we...we go back a little.

23:22.443 --> 23:25.737
He wanted to know about
the crew in his court...

23:25.821 --> 23:27.572
I had to go upstairs

23:27.656 --> 23:32.243
and explain to the deputy why he's getting
calls about murders that don't mean a shit.

23:32.328 --> 23:35.163
Look, sir, this judge, he fucks me up.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.249
He asks me a question and I answer it.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.543
I didn't know he was gonna call anybody.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.425
You have my attention, Detective.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.011
My complete, undivided attention.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.185
- Yes, sir.
- Where you going?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.355
- I'm eight to four.
- No.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.690
- You're typing.
- Sir?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.945
Deputy wants a report on his desk at 0800.

24:07.154 --> 24:10.698
- A report?
- Clean, no typos.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.201
Make it look right, then put my name on it.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.539
Do you want to reference all the murders
or should I soft-pedal that?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.291
Fucking horse is out the barn door, right?

24:20.668 --> 24:22.794
Let's try not to make me look stupid twice.

24:24.171 --> 24:28.007
And when you list the cases,
put a little dot next to each one.

24:28.551 --> 24:31.636
- Deputy likes dots.
- I'm sorry, Major, really.

24:45.401 --> 24:49.112
Niggers crazy in there, yo.
Eastside, Westside, everybody beefing.

24:50.239 --> 24:53.825
- You ain't got no problem, right?
- Hell no, we deep in there.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.202
Mm.

24:56.287 --> 24:58.413
Y'all deep down at the courthouse, too.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.583
I didn't know what the fuck would happen.

25:01.667 --> 25:05.170
I'm wondering how y'all gonna make it
happen for me, you know?

25:05.546 --> 25:09.841
Slick what y'all did with that security lady.
That shit was tight, yo.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.348
Let's walk.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.782
- What's the rule?
- I know the rule.

25:35.784 --> 25:39.454
- Say it.
- Don't talk in the car.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.709
Or on the phone
or any place that ain't ours

25:44.793 --> 25:47.420
or to anybody who ain't us.
But it was just you.

25:47.504 --> 25:49.088
It's your fucking truck.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.717
Don't talk in the car.

26:13.656 --> 26:16.324
My friends, yeah

26:18.369 --> 26:21.621
Feel it's their appointed duty

26:25.501 --> 26:27.752
They keep trying to tell me...

26:27.836 --> 26:29.128
What about Marcel?

26:31.048 --> 26:33.466
No, I ain't inviting Marcel.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.803
- You want him out?
- I really don't give a shit what you do.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.596
Actually, no.

26:38.681 --> 26:41.349
Go down and make that motherfucker
pay for his drinks.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.518
The bum.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.395
Oh, boy!

26:51.735 --> 26:54.362
- How you doing?
- What's up, D? Good to see you.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.031
What up, man? I ain't seen you in a long time.

26:59.785 --> 27:03.371
Yo, you remember the cop
that tried to pin Gerard on little Kevin?

27:03.455 --> 27:06.749
- Which one?
- White detective, black hair.

27:06.834 --> 27:10.378
- The one that was knocking on all the doors.
- What about him?

27:11.672 --> 27:13.756
He showed up in court to watch.

27:14.925 --> 27:16.009
Word.

27:16.719 --> 27:20.096
What are you talking to
that motherfucker for? Damn, D.

27:21.223 --> 27:24.350
- He say anything?
- No, just sat in the back.

27:34.194 --> 27:37.196
- What up?
- What you got?

27:37.281 --> 27:39.991
- Huh?
- Come here, I got something for you.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.257
- You must feel good.
- You know how that go.

27:56.592 --> 27:59.927
- Say what?
- I'm saying, you know, jail ain't no joke.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.929
I don't know shit about jail.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.432
I don't plan on knowing shit
about jail, you feel me?

28:04.600 --> 28:07.393
You wanna talk about jail,
go sit down next to Marcel.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.730
- He just got home.
- True, you right.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.107
Sit your ass down.

28:19.448 --> 28:23.201
I know it ain't go good.
That nigger Pooh, he caught me off guard.

28:23.285 --> 28:26.120
- He came at me like he was crazy.
- So you shoot the motherfucker?

28:26.747 --> 28:28.456
I'm saying, it was him or me.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.333
You in our building.

28:30.751 --> 28:34.879
You got people on both stairs,
more motherfucking people in the court.

28:36.965 --> 28:40.676
And you got a gun.
So, what I'm trying to figure out is...

28:40.928 --> 28:45.306
how the fuck you shoot this nigger in front of
the security booth with them people around?

28:45.516 --> 28:48.434
This nigger was coming at me
like he was trying to end me.

28:48.519 --> 28:49.727
This ain't about him.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.854
It's about you.

28:52.648 --> 28:56.442
You can't play him out of that lobby.
You can't take a beating.

28:56.527 --> 28:59.404
So the first thing you do,
you get all emotional.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.615
You pull your gun out,
you do some dumb shit...

29:02.825 --> 29:04.700
that now we got to work around.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.078
I know.

29:10.791 --> 29:13.668
You ain't said
one motherfucking thing I want to hear.

29:15.838 --> 29:19.674
You right. You right.
I mean, I gotta start thinking more.

29:19.842 --> 29:22.218
You say that all the time and you right.

29:23.554 --> 29:25.638
But I'm saying though, I mean...

29:25.722 --> 29:28.516
the shit y'all pulled with that security lady.

29:28.934 --> 29:32.728
It was tight. I mean, that state lawyer.

29:32.813 --> 29:36.023
I ain't never seen a white woman turn so red.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.192
You should've been there.

29:39.069 --> 29:41.195
Yo, man, you family, OK?

29:41.864 --> 29:46.075
But that shit cost money.
It cost time and money.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.454
You gonna make that right?

29:49.538 --> 29:51.581
Most def, you gonna see.

29:51.665 --> 29:53.791
When I get back to the tower,
I'm gonna push them niggers.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.382
All right.

30:04.970 --> 30:05.970
Come here.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.640
Don't walk out of here like that.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.559
You family, all right?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.603
- You know it's always love.
- Yeah.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.624
Type quieter.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.752
You didn't have to wait up, love.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.587
Your boy have a heart attack?

30:39.922 --> 30:44.091
No, I went that way but Doc Frazier
didn't bite when this popped up.

30:44.760 --> 30:48.763
- You seriously fucked.
- Speaking of fucked, why are you here?

30:49.515 --> 30:51.974
I did bad, Bunk. It wasn't my fault.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.809
Really.

30:54.269 --> 30:57.438
Judge Phelan pulled me up
when the jury let the Barksdale kid go.

30:57.523 --> 31:00.858
Him being a judge and all,
I let go of some shit.

31:01.443 --> 31:02.985
He raise a stink?

31:03.737 --> 31:05.613
Major got busted by the Deputy Ops

31:05.697 --> 31:07.698
and I gotta have a report by morning.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.992
There you go, giving a fuck

31:10.077 --> 31:12.453
when it ain't your turn to give a fuck.

31:22.172 --> 31:23.714
Look at 'em, Cole.

31:24.424 --> 31:27.385
Don't it make your dick bust concrete
to be in the same room

31:27.469 --> 31:31.681
with two noble, selfless public servants?
I know I'm proud.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.601
Tell me you put this one down.

31:36.520 --> 31:40.815
Of course not. Of course your partner
has to go to the courthouse

31:40.983 --> 31:43.442
and lay our business out in front of a judge.

31:43.527 --> 31:44.944
So you heard?

31:45.028 --> 31:49.156
Major calls me, says I should get in early,
read over your shoulder.

31:52.286 --> 31:55.454
It's got dots. Deputy loves dots.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.498
Fuck you and your dots.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.168
All I did was answer the guy's questions.
He's a fucking judge.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.630
And the deputy's the fucking deputy.

32:04.715 --> 32:09.010
And he, not the judge, has what's left
of your beshitted career in his hands.

32:09.344 --> 32:13.014
He says so, you're walking foot
in the Western tomorrow.

32:13.348 --> 32:17.643
- Fuck it, I came from Western.
- Where don't you want to go, asshole?

32:17.978 --> 32:20.313
Evidence Control? Personnel?

32:22.274 --> 32:25.026
- Headquarter Security?
- The boat.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.069
The marine unit?

32:27.529 --> 32:29.780
Yeah, those diesel fumes,
they make me seasick.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.199
That's good, keep it up.

32:32.826 --> 32:36.120
I'll go this against 10,
you're riding the boat, midnight shift.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.542
Listen to the man, Jimmy.

32:57.476 --> 32:58.851
Yo, Stringer!

33:00.729 --> 33:03.981
- You here early.
- Yeah, I'm on my game today.

33:04.566 --> 33:07.610
- Eggy put out testers?
- Uh-huh. D...

33:10.322 --> 33:11.739
New deal today.

33:12.741 --> 33:15.159
You going out on point,
picking up business in the Pit.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.287
- What?
- You the man in the low-rises.

33:19.456 --> 33:22.041
The low-rises? You got Ronnie Mo in the Pit.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.085
Ronnie Mo got 851 this morning.

33:26.254 --> 33:29.507
Why you put me in the low-rises?
I had a tower since summer.

33:29.591 --> 33:31.300
Yeah, you had a tower.

33:32.719 --> 33:36.430
And you might have a tower again
if you can keep your mind to shit.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.265
This is fucked up.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.560
You show us you can run the Pit
and you'll be back uptown soon enough.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.691
My uncle know about this?

33:49.277 --> 33:50.444
What do you think?

33:52.656 --> 33:54.198
- Yo, Bey.
- Yo.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.618
Give little cousin here a ride down the way.

34:15.512 --> 34:18.139
- Have your people deal with Daniels.
- Right.

34:34.822 --> 34:38.993
You gonna send your man McNulty?
Tell him about chain-of-command.

34:39.453 --> 34:41.495
Tell him yourself, he's dead to me.

35:15.989 --> 35:19.241
- Yo, you looking for Ronnie Mo, he uptown.
- I know.

35:22.537 --> 35:23.996
You D, right?

35:25.874 --> 35:28.667
- Wasn't you in the towers?
- Yeah.

35:29.711 --> 35:32.379
Why they put you down here, yo?
You mess with the count or something?

35:34.549 --> 35:37.468
I killed a nigger.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.142
Last call on green top, last call.

35:46.394 --> 35:47.853
Yeah?

35:49.231 --> 35:50.272
Major?

35:50.357 --> 35:53.609
Counting what we got from the DEA,
how much do we have on this guy?

35:54.736 --> 35:57.530
- Lieutenant, I'm holding how many pages?
- Four, sir.

35:57.614 --> 36:01.534
- Rawls had a fucking phone book.
- They got ten open murder files.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.954
If we get ten shots at him,
we'd have more than a fat file.

36:05.038 --> 36:08.082
- I said that.
- They can't put him down for murder

36:08.250 --> 36:11.377
- so they're getting us to do their work.
- Not getting us, they got us.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.588
- They got you, in fact.
- Excuse me, sir?

36:14.923 --> 36:17.842
Dawson has the York and Cator case,
that leaves you.

36:19.052 --> 36:21.512
Shit. Look, set something up
with Homicide

36:21.638 --> 36:23.305
and whoever you want from your squads.

36:23.390 --> 36:26.267
- State's Attorney?
- Yeah, we should call them, too.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.396
Fucking shitstorm.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.316
Lieutenant, line three.

36:35.652 --> 36:37.069
Deputy Ops.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.205
Here we go.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.041
Close that for me.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.379
What's the coffee do?

36:55.463 --> 36:58.674
Give it that money feel,
so it don't seem so white.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.511
Leastways, you got it
on both sides this time.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.179
All right, give me the real.

37:09.978 --> 37:12.062
Wait, why are we gonna use real money?

37:12.147 --> 37:15.357
We're not burning
no lemon street chumps here. Feel me?

37:17.736 --> 37:18.944
I'm down.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.409
You down? Johnny's down.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.545
- You got that gig.
- Can I get a one-on-one?

37:36.630 --> 37:38.088
Yo, Poot.

37:52.312 --> 37:54.021
Yo, Wallace.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.444
This the way Ronnie Mo set it up?

38:00.528 --> 38:02.363
- Yeah.
- Man, this is fucked up.

38:04.866 --> 38:07.910
You can't serve your customers
straight up after taking they money.

38:08.328 --> 38:11.705
Somebody snapping pictures,
they got the whole damn thing.

38:12.832 --> 38:16.543
You get paid, you send they ass off
around the building, yo.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.545
Then you serve. All right?

38:19.047 --> 38:21.715
We gotta start tightening up, man.
No more short cuts.

38:23.426 --> 38:26.428
- What's your count?
- I'm up 270.

38:30.517 --> 38:31.725
You want to count it.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.062
I don't know how
you do shit up in the towers.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.231
- But down here, you want to count it.
- Shit.

38:40.694 --> 38:42.403
Hey, yo, yo, ho, ho, ho!

38:43.905 --> 38:45.739
- Y'all niggers been burned.
- Huh?

38:46.241 --> 38:49.243
"Huh"? That's what you got to say? "Huh"?

38:50.120 --> 38:52.162
This look like money, motherfucker?

38:52.247 --> 38:56.417
Money be green. Money feel like money.

38:56.710 --> 39:00.212
- That shit look green to you?
- It got a dead fucking president on it.

39:00.296 --> 39:02.631
I don't give a fuck about the president.

39:02.716 --> 39:05.217
- That shit ain't money.
- He ain't no president.

39:06.136 --> 39:09.096
- What you mean?
- Hamilton. He ain't no president.

39:09.472 --> 39:10.597
Nigger, is you crazy?

39:11.099 --> 39:15.019
No ugly-ass white man get his face
on legal tender except he president.

39:16.271 --> 39:19.440
This shit happen again, you off the money.
You hear me?

39:20.275 --> 39:21.650
You ain't even gonna be serving.

39:22.110 --> 39:25.612
You be on the end of Vine Street,
sucking on a 40, yelling "five-0".

39:26.156 --> 39:27.573
You hear me?

39:28.658 --> 39:30.284
Get the fuck outta here.

39:33.163 --> 39:34.329
That it?

39:35.749 --> 39:36.832
No.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.689
You need to pace that shit, man.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.487
- Johnny, man, you hear me?
- I'm cool.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.364
No, man, you gonna fall out,

40:09.449 --> 40:12.785
slamming that shit like that
one of these days, boy.

40:17.332 --> 40:20.459
Man, I'm trying to give
you a little game, man...

40:20.835 --> 40:23.087
but you want to pretend
like you know something.

40:25.381 --> 40:27.007
I know a lot, Bubs.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.218
No, no, you...you green.

40:30.053 --> 40:33.305
I'm trying to get you...
I'm trying to get you brown, man...

40:33.389 --> 40:35.432
but you still green.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.018
You gonna make me brown?

40:43.525 --> 40:44.858
Yo, Bubs?

40:46.361 --> 40:48.070
Let me do the scam tomorrow.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.199
Come on, man, I'm ready.

40:56.079 --> 40:57.329
Yo, I'm brown.

40:59.541 --> 41:03.377
Shit, man, you ain't even fucking beige.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.653
- Buy-busts.
- Yes, sir.

41:29.737 --> 41:33.740
No long surveillances,
no Kel recorders, no DNRs.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.410
I want to get in and out
as quickly as possible.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.913
- That makes sense.
- Phelan isn't just a judge,

41:40.206 --> 41:42.291
he's a political entity.

41:43.084 --> 41:45.752
If he asks for something,
I want to give it to him.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.255
Why is he asking about this Barksdale?

41:50.091 --> 41:53.343
He watched his state's attorney
get beat up in his court this week.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.847
- Lost a murder case.
- We lose cases all the time.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.600
But a judge happens
to be asking about this one.

42:00.643 --> 42:03.270
- Now, who you using?
- Lead detective?

42:03.438 --> 42:06.273
- Greggs, she's my best right now.
- I know her?

42:06.774 --> 42:09.943
CID for four months.
Came over from Eastern DEU.

42:10.904 --> 42:14.072
- Who's Homicide sending?
- That's up to Major Rawls.

42:15.116 --> 42:17.409
I wouldn't be surprised if you get McNulty.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.245
- You know McNulty?
- Not really.

42:20.705 --> 42:23.290
He mouthed off to the judge in the first place.

42:23.708 --> 42:26.460
- He talked to the judge?
- That's my understanding.

42:27.086 --> 42:29.963
So, if he comes over on this,
watch your back.

42:30.215 --> 42:32.382
You need anything, you ask me.

42:32.842 --> 42:35.344
I'll give you all the help I can.
But no surprises.

42:36.012 --> 42:37.137
Yes, sir.

42:38.014 --> 42:39.431
Keep me briefed.

42:57.325 --> 43:00.494
- Hi, McNulty, City Homicide.
- Is anyone expecting you?

43:00.828 --> 43:03.080
Yeah, Special Agent Fitzhugh, Squad Five.

43:05.500 --> 43:08.377
- He's expecting me, can I...?
- Not without an escort.

43:09.671 --> 43:11.004
All right.

43:11.172 --> 43:13.006
Agent Fitzhugh to the front.

43:28.189 --> 43:29.731
- Hey, Fitz.
- Hey, brother.

43:29.816 --> 43:32.442
- She can spot a bad one.
- Nothing personal.

43:32.527 --> 43:35.654
- You know how they are with security.
- I know how they are with locals.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.699
- What's up, G-man?
- Good stuff, brother.

43:39.158 --> 43:40.701
Your man gave us a hell of a case.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.370
Comes to informants, Jimmy,
you can pick 'em.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.163
He's one of the better CI's I've worked.

43:45.248 --> 43:47.874
- You up on a wire?
- That and more.

43:50.586 --> 43:54.047
'So, like, he be talking like
he got some kind of record deal.'

43:54.382 --> 43:57.426
- 'Man, please.'
- 'That nigger.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.763
- 'The pussy has you.'
- Jesus Christ.

44:02.056 --> 44:04.891
- Pretty fucking great, huh?
- How'd you get this on tape?

44:05.393 --> 44:08.103
That's not tape.
That's live, brother.

44:09.731 --> 44:10.897
That's live?

44:11.274 --> 44:14.067
Live from a three-story walk-up
on Homer Avenue

44:14.319 --> 44:15.777
in the bottoms of Pimlico.

44:15.862 --> 44:18.530
- This is going on right now?
- As we speak.

44:18.990 --> 44:21.033
- How?
- Fiber-optic lensing.

44:21.617 --> 44:25.370
Camera's behind a hole in the wall.
So small it looks like a nail might've made it.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.206
Where's the mic?
These fuckers sound great.

44:28.624 --> 44:31.168
Two remotes behind
the baseboard heating ducts.

44:31.961 --> 44:34.171
That's about 3K of raw on the table today.

44:34.464 --> 44:37.257
- We followed it from New York.
- You're up in New York on this?

44:37.800 --> 44:39.092
We could be.

44:39.427 --> 44:41.595
We're backing into some
Dominicans up there.

44:42.180 --> 44:44.264
We could have a Title three
on 'em right now if we wanted.

44:45.433 --> 44:46.767
Wrong war, brother.

44:47.185 --> 44:49.436
Most of the squad's
gone to counterterrorism.

44:49.645 --> 44:51.855
This is the last drug case pending.

44:51.939 --> 44:54.024
I gotta shut it down by the end of the month.

44:54.108 --> 44:56.985
- You guys are getting out of drugs?
- Yeah, for a while.

44:57.070 --> 44:59.529
We don't have the manpower
to stay on anything big.

44:59.655 --> 45:01.198
Not since those towers fell.

45:01.949 --> 45:04.326
We don't have enough love
in our hearts for two wars?

45:05.995 --> 45:09.289
- Joke's on us, huh?
- I guess so. Still...

45:09.791 --> 45:13.001
You give great case.
I wish you could've worked it with us.

45:29.310 --> 45:32.479
Got some Tech Nine over here.
Tech Nine.

45:38.820 --> 45:42.406
That's it, here's 20, hook it up.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.367
Two and two.

45:45.451 --> 45:46.785
- Hold up.
- What?

45:46.869 --> 45:49.871
- Just two and two.
- Come on, man, I ain't got time for this.

45:49.956 --> 45:52.082
- I gave you 20, man.
- You gave me 20?

45:52.291 --> 45:54.543
- One and a short three.
- So you get, two...

45:54.627 --> 45:56.294
- Seven!
- Hold up.

45:56.379 --> 45:59.589
- I get seven back. Come on, man.
- Calm down.

46:01.676 --> 46:04.094
Hold up, hold up, you
fucking me up. Chill out.

46:06.681 --> 46:09.266
You dropping shit on the ground?

46:09.350 --> 46:11.810
- Hold up.
- I ain't got all day.

46:11.894 --> 46:14.438
Come on, man, it's easy. Let's rewind, man.

46:14.522 --> 46:18.483
What the fuck is you doing?
Look at this shit. Look, nigger.

46:18.568 --> 46:20.485
- That's the motherfucker.
- Who?

46:20.570 --> 46:23.363
The white boy right there.
Poot, grab that motherfucker.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.782
The white boy.

46:25.867 --> 46:27.909
- D, man!
- Hold up, man.

46:27.994 --> 46:30.537
Hey!

46:37.336 --> 46:40.464
Hey! Stop that white motherfucker.

46:40.548 --> 46:44.301
Yeah, motherfucker, yeah, nigger. Fuck that.

46:44.385 --> 46:46.136
What are you doing, man?

46:46.345 --> 46:47.804
Calm down, man.

46:47.889 --> 46:49.973
Making me run, what is wrong with you?

46:50.057 --> 46:52.976
- What, man, why you fucking with me?
- Shit.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.353
This the motherfucker
with the make-believe money.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.230
Seen his ass drop it and shit.

46:57.398 --> 47:00.108
- Wasn't me.
- Motherfucker.

47:00.860 --> 47:03.403
It was this nigger, I saw him. Get the fuck up.

47:05.740 --> 47:08.283
- All right, listen, I'm sorry.
- Fuck that.

47:09.494 --> 47:12.496
Motherfucker burned us for $30.
Take him to Franklin Avenue

47:12.580 --> 47:14.789
and throw his ass onto
the motherfucking expressway.

47:15.875 --> 47:19.586
All right, listen, I'm fucking sorry.
I fucked up, man.

47:19.670 --> 47:22.923
- What you got on you?
- Just the 10 I dropped, man, the real one.

47:40.733 --> 47:42.484
Well?! What's up?

47:51.536 --> 47:52.953
Fuck it.

47:56.624 --> 47:58.124
Hell, yeah.

48:04.966 --> 48:07.801
We'll work out of Narcotics,
with Kima keeping the file.

48:08.052 --> 48:10.470
We'll copy everything to Ronnie
at the courthouse.

48:11.347 --> 48:12.389
Fine with us.

48:12.473 --> 48:16.017
McNulty and Santangelo will work
on the open murders.

48:17.270 --> 48:19.896
Kima and my people will do
hand-to-hand stuff in the Terrace.

48:19.981 --> 48:21.231
Buy-bust, quick and dirty.

48:21.482 --> 48:24.568
We put years over top of some
of these people, we'll roll a few.

48:24.652 --> 48:29.155
You're not gonna get Avon Barksdale
or Stringer Bell on street rips.

48:29.615 --> 48:31.533
- You don't know that.
- These guys are good.

48:31.993 --> 48:34.744
They've got everyone running scared.

48:34.954 --> 48:36.162
What do you suggest?

48:36.706 --> 48:39.916
Surveillance teams,
DNRs, asset investigation.

48:40.001 --> 48:41.918
Gather string till we find a way in.

48:42.003 --> 48:45.130
Either a wired CI or a Title three.
That's what makes this case.

48:45.214 --> 48:46.631
Is that what you told the judge?

48:47.883 --> 48:50.927
OK, so I'm an asshole for that.
But I'm right about this much.

48:52.763 --> 48:55.890
No mics, no wires.
We do this fast and clean and simple.

48:55.975 --> 48:58.101
- Then you don't do it at all.
- What the...?

48:58.185 --> 49:02.272
You could've had this fight
before calling the State's Attorney's office.

49:02.898 --> 49:06.359
Let me ask you something.
What do we know about Avon Barksdale?

49:06.986 --> 49:08.403
What do we know?

49:08.571 --> 49:11.865
The guy's owned
all of Franklin Terrace for a year.

49:12.033 --> 49:14.993
What do we have on him right now?
A DOB? A sheet?

49:15.995 --> 49:17.162
A B of I photo?

49:18.039 --> 49:19.956
We don't have a fucking photo of the guy.

49:20.166 --> 49:21.666
Gimme a break, Jimmy.

49:21.876 --> 49:24.753
Two days ago no one
on this fucking floor knew his name.

49:25.046 --> 49:26.963
Now he's some criminal mastermind.

49:27.214 --> 49:30.508
Shit, I say we go to the Terrace
and fuck some people up.

49:32.386 --> 49:35.388
You don't need a prosecutor,
you need a fucking referee.

49:35.723 --> 49:37.557
When you know how you're playing this, yell.

49:37.642 --> 49:39.100
We know how we're playing it.

49:39.769 --> 49:41.853
My people are going down
to do hand-to-hands.

49:42.229 --> 49:46.316
Detectives McNulty and Santangelo
are going to review old murder files

49:46.400 --> 49:48.526
and try to make a fresh prosecution.

49:49.028 --> 49:53.239
I'll get us more manpower
but this case is not going to sprawl.

49:53.824 --> 49:56.534
A month from now,
we're all gonna be back at our day jobs.

49:57.036 --> 49:59.120
Fine. Bring me your hand-to-hands.

49:59.288 --> 50:03.625
Anything on the murders, take to
Ilene Nathan in violent crimes. I'll clue her in.

50:08.381 --> 50:09.464
Anything else?

50:12.134 --> 50:13.426
One last thing.

50:14.095 --> 50:18.348
No one does anything on the street
without me knowing about it first.

50:20.434 --> 50:22.227
Chain-of-command, Detective.

50:22.603 --> 50:25.188
That's how we do things
down this end of the hall.

50:31.112 --> 50:34.030
If she's fucking you on visitation,
take her ass to court.

50:34.115 --> 50:38.618
Judge gives me three weekends out of four,
I still need her to cooperate.

50:39.412 --> 50:41.121
You know, move it around,

50:41.997 --> 50:44.499
so when I have to work through a weekend,
she switches.

50:45.459 --> 50:48.962
The judge gives me
three weekends but no flex, I still lose.

50:49.547 --> 50:52.298
- You two can't talk this through?
- No.

50:54.385 --> 50:57.095
How is it you always got
the whole world pissed off at you?

50:58.973 --> 51:01.558
You know Daniels? Narcotics?

51:01.809 --> 51:04.436
- What about him?
- He's running this detail.

51:05.646 --> 51:08.189
- Watch your ass then.
- He a snake?

51:08.774 --> 51:12.068
No, he ain't that.
But he's a company man.

51:12.528 --> 51:14.279
You know, a prospect.

51:14.864 --> 51:17.490
Grapevine says the next district
to open up is his.

51:17.783 --> 51:19.367
Shortlist for major?

51:20.035 --> 51:23.204
He's black, still young,
he hasn't pissed anybody off.

51:23.664 --> 51:26.082
- Shit, he even has a law degree.
- No shit.

51:26.333 --> 51:30.587
- University of Baltimore, but still.
- He's gonna fuck this Barksdale thing up.

51:31.338 --> 51:33.840
- How's that?
- Buy-bust?

51:34.175 --> 51:38.094
- He's pissing in the wind.
- You already fucked it up, Jimmy.

51:38.429 --> 51:39.846
You made it happen.

51:42.141 --> 51:45.143
I feel like that motherfucker
at the end of Bridge On The River Kwai.

51:45.561 --> 51:48.772
- What the fuck did I do?
- The bridge of what?

51:49.356 --> 51:51.232
- You ain't seen that movie?
- Mm-mm.

51:52.651 --> 51:54.235
I am fucked.

51:58.365 --> 51:59.699
Fucked is me.

52:02.244 --> 52:05.079
God damn it, you gonna make me
go another round.

52:05.790 --> 52:07.040
Two more.

52:11.086 --> 52:13.254
Fits nice...

52:17.426 --> 52:21.179
- It's all in the game.
- It was only a couple of dollars.

52:21.263 --> 52:23.640
- It ain't the money.
- But we fucked him up bad.

52:23.724 --> 52:25.767
It's the message, D.

52:27.228 --> 52:29.229
You can't show no weakness.

52:30.606 --> 52:32.398
- Still, I'm saying.
- What?

52:34.401 --> 52:35.610
Hm?

52:43.285 --> 52:45.745
String. Yo, Stringer!

52:57.424 --> 53:00.051
Operate around the clock

53:00.636 --> 53:02.804
Why don't you come in?

53:06.767 --> 53:09.769
You ain't touched that drink.
You want some company?

53:11.272 --> 53:13.898
- I ain't no john.
- Good, 'cause I ain't no whore.

53:15.442 --> 53:17.193
I'm not a regular, OK?

53:17.278 --> 53:20.238
- I work for Stringer.
- He pay you, don't he?

53:22.199 --> 53:23.783
Come on, buy me a drink.

53:26.495 --> 53:28.454
- How much?
- 20.

53:30.875 --> 53:32.250
I drink slow.

53:37.006 --> 53:38.756
Maybe another time.

53:53.564 --> 53:56.733
- Buy me a drink, honey?
- How about you buy me a drink?

53:59.653 --> 54:01.821
Carla. One here.

54:24.970 --> 54:26.137
Hey.

54:26.221 --> 54:28.598
- Where you at?
- Where you think?

54:32.686 --> 54:35.229
- You late for work?
- A little.

54:38.025 --> 54:40.860
- How much you got left?
- Girl, please.

54:41.195 --> 54:45.365
- Ten pages and all the footnotes.
- When's it due?

54:46.033 --> 54:47.951
Tomorrow, beginning of class.

54:53.415 --> 54:55.416
Long night for you.

54:58.087 --> 54:59.712
Long night for me.

55:04.718 --> 55:07.720
I'll pick up some coffee.

55:17.064 --> 55:20.024
So, I drive all the way
down to Liberty Road

55:20.109 --> 55:23.277
at two in the damn morning,
on a midnight shift.

55:23.362 --> 55:26.531
I got two murders and a police shooting
going down, to do what?

55:26.615 --> 55:30.576
To get a goddamn mouse out of
my wife's closet. Can you imagine that shit?

55:31.745 --> 55:33.413
So what did you do?

55:34.790 --> 55:38.543
What the fuck you think?
I got the mouse out and drove back to work.

55:39.044 --> 55:40.628
Couldn't do nothing else.

55:42.131 --> 55:45.425
Nadine out of her mind
over this little-ass field mouse.

55:45.509 --> 55:49.429
She's up on the chair and shit
like some goddamn cartoon.

55:49.972 --> 55:53.725
- How did you catch the mouse?
- Catch him? I lit his ass up.

55:56.729 --> 55:59.981
- You shot the mouse? With your nine?
- Mm-hm.

56:00.649 --> 56:02.900
First shot killed my wife's dress shoe.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.944
Got him with the second.

56:12.536 --> 56:13.661
What?

56:15.122 --> 56:17.206
You shot a mouse with your service weapon?

56:17.291 --> 56:18.624
Yeah.

56:19.668 --> 56:23.046
- What'd you do with the carcass?
- I cleaned it up, you know.

56:23.464 --> 56:27.133
I thought about leaving that little
motherfucker as a warning to others.

56:35.559 --> 56:36.934
Fuck me.

56:40.647 --> 56:45.151
It's 3:30 in the morning.
I'm supposed to be early relief.

56:45.652 --> 56:49.280
Jimmy, man,
I gotta change my clothes at least, come on.

56:50.324 --> 56:52.325
I'm gonna do this case.

56:55.162 --> 56:56.370
What?

56:56.455 --> 56:59.665
I'm gonna do this case
the way it should be done.

57:00.459 --> 57:02.418
It's a buy-bust, get in and get out.

57:02.503 --> 57:04.378
- Fuck that.
- Jimmy.

57:14.848 --> 57:16.390
Let's call it a night.

57:40.624 --> 57:42.125
Hi, Bubs.

57:44.336 --> 57:45.962
Thought you was still locked up.

57:47.422 --> 57:48.422
Nope.

57:50.801 --> 57:52.301
How long you been home?

57:54.054 --> 57:55.179
It's been three months.

57:57.224 --> 57:59.267
You don't write, you don't call.

58:02.271 --> 58:03.604
Who's he?

58:05.566 --> 58:06.941
A friend.

58:09.653 --> 58:11.154
Is he gonna make it?

58:17.494 --> 58:19.162
You still working drugs?

58:22.166 --> 58:24.167
Downtown, yeah.

58:26.670 --> 58:28.379
I got something for you.

58:40.267 --> 58:43.102
- Last call!
- Ohh... ! Fuck.

58:44.938 --> 58:47.190
Found body. 200, Block Amity.

58:47.649 --> 58:49.275
I'm a little thin today, boss.

58:50.485 --> 58:53.613
The whole squad's a little thin, remember?

58:54.281 --> 58:57.909
We're down a man
since your partner got himself detailed.

59:00.829 --> 59:02.788
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:04.416 --> 59:05.708
I got it.

59:16.678 --> 59:17.803
Jesus.

59:34.780 --> 59:38.407
- How you doing, Bobby?
- Bunk, what's going on, man?

59:38.492 --> 59:40.785
We got one or two shots to the head.

59:41.328 --> 59:43.329
No witnesses, no suspects.

59:44.248 --> 59:46.207
A .380 casing on the ground there.

59:46.291 --> 59:48.167
Do me a favor, bag that for me.

59:48.585 --> 59:54.090
- So, who called it in?
- No one. 21 Post found him.

59:54.591 --> 01:00:00.721
It's a William Gant, 42, no, 43 years old...
Er, address on Schroeder.

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:02.807
- You got pictures?
- Yeah.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.642
OK, let's roll him.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:14.527
'Mr. Gant, do you see the man
you identified sitting in the courtroom today?'

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:17.530
He's right there.
