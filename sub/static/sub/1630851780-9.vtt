WEBVTT

00:57.023 --> 00:58.291
What the hell is this, Raul?

01:00.160 --> 01:01.194
God!

01:03.363 --> 01:05.465
-What's going on?
-Calm down. Come here.

01:05.532 --> 01:07.233
-Calm!
-Are you crazy? He's my dad.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.935
He's my dad, Raul.
Let me see him!

01:45.705 --> 01:47.073
EPISODE:
CIRO

02:02.255 --> 02:03.656
The toys arrived this morning.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.092
I told them to deliver them
at the warehouse.

02:06.159 --> 02:08.161
They don't want.
They think it's too risky.

02:08.661 --> 02:10.697
-They want somewhere neutral.
-Who do they think they are?

02:10.763 --> 02:12.565
Chief! They accepted the price.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.401
Just a minute.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.484
These arrived too.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.221
Where is it going to be?

02:35.555 --> 02:37.657
I've spent three weeks
coming here at night.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.659
No patrol cars. No cameras.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.194
The escape routes
are really good.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.329
I'm going to put one car
in each of the exits.

02:43.396 --> 02:44.564
I asked Pibe for backup.

02:44.631 --> 02:47.634
Okay, but if they mess up,
it will be their problem.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.627
Hi.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.497
It's me.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.632
I need to talk to you.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.350
-Here.
-Excellent.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.619
-Look at this three of a kind.
-You can't do that, Waldir!

03:39.953 --> 03:42.488
-We said no to that.
-It's my turn, isn't it?

03:42.555 --> 03:45.091
-The one who asks...
-Okay, I take one and...

03:45.158 --> 03:46.125
Raul Fagnani!

03:47.594 --> 03:48.561
Raul?

03:49.329 --> 03:50.396
Who are you?

03:50.463 --> 03:51.664
Lígia Vazquez.

03:52.098 --> 03:53.700
-Mi husband...
-Has disappeared?

03:58.671 --> 03:59.639
Excuse me.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.574
He met with some friends
to play football yesterday.

04:01.641 --> 04:03.776
He plays every Friday.
But he hasn't come back.

04:03.843 --> 04:06.112
Yesterday?
With all due respect, Lígia,

04:06.179 --> 04:09.349
but it's been a few hours
since you last heard of him.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.418
Are you sure you want
to start an investigation?

04:12.485 --> 04:14.454
You don't know Ciro.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.089
He's very methodical.

04:16.155 --> 04:18.024
He always attends
his commitments.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.026
He was supposed to be back home
at around ten.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.161
I've called him several times.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.398
His name is Ciro. Surname?

04:25.465 --> 04:26.399
Vazquez.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.569
Wait, your husband is...

04:29.636 --> 04:32.038
Ciro Vazquez?
"The" Ciro Vazquez?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.040
From Operation
"Vento no Litoral"?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.009
That arrested
all those congressman?

04:36.075 --> 04:38.044
-Right.
-He's the man of the moment

04:38.111 --> 04:40.113
at the Public
Prosecution Office.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.048
Why have you come to my agency

04:42.115 --> 04:44.384
instead of going to the police?

04:44.450 --> 04:47.987
I can't let the politics world
know about this.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.489
This can't become public.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.658
At least not before we know
what happened.

04:51.724 --> 04:54.661
Do you know if he received
any threats or anything?

04:54.994 --> 04:57.330
He's one of the main prosecutors
at the Public Prosecution Office

04:57.397 --> 04:58.331
in São Paulo.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.367
He's always stressed,
but nothing out of the ordinary.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.003
He's super correct.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.639
He hasn't come back
or got in touch with me.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.608
Something bad
must have happened!

05:16.983 --> 05:18.518
-I'm sorry. I moved everything.
-You did.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.154
Did you find him?

05:21.220 --> 05:24.457
No, but I found out
plays football every Friday.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.993
He always goes to the bar,
but he didn't go yesterday.

05:27.694 --> 05:29.362
-Maybe Ciro has a...?
-Lover?

05:30.463 --> 05:32.532
I pressured the guy.
He thinks he doesn't,

05:32.598 --> 05:34.100
but he wouldn't bet his life
on him.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.002
I wouldn't either.

05:36.469 --> 05:37.537
He's the goalkeeper.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.440
He catches all the balls
to make everyone else happy.

05:40.506 --> 05:41.574
He has to have an escape valve.

05:41.641 --> 05:44.610
Why are you being so suspicious?
Do you feel guilty?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.012
Have you taken a detour?

05:46.079 --> 05:47.347
Listen.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.682
What I do outside my house
doesn't concern my wife.

05:50.016 --> 05:50.950
That's out deal.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.354
I see. How long have you been
having doubts about separating?

05:55.021 --> 05:57.423
When was the last time
you had sex?

05:58.391 --> 06:00.093
-You need sex.
-Me?

06:00.159 --> 06:02.228
If you had sex
as often as you complain...

06:03.296 --> 06:04.397
This is a horrible song.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.499
You got nervous!
Don't touch my radio.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.470
-Horrible? What do you mean?
-This is music, you see?

06:10.536 --> 06:12.305
The other thing was suffering.

06:14.173 --> 06:17.310
Mrs. Lígia, I need
all the information possible,

06:17.377 --> 06:20.279
so that my algorithm
finds out his email password.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.015
Either that,
or we wait one more week.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.151
Is that what you prefer?

06:27.019 --> 06:27.954
Seven...

06:29.989 --> 06:32.692
No. The investigation
is just getting started.

06:32.759 --> 06:35.495
I'll contact you as soon as
I have more information.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.069
These women are impossible!
I can't stand them!

06:43.136 --> 06:45.605
They must take something.
It's impossible!

06:47.140 --> 06:48.641
Have you traced the car
down yet?

06:48.708 --> 06:51.177
Yes. He left
the football field from Jardins.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.546
He went to Trianon Park
and stayed there for a while.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.648
Then Água Branca.

06:59.452 --> 07:00.420
Is this his car?

07:02.155 --> 07:03.689
Lígia mentioned this plate
to Tai.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.561
The car has been here
since last night.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.135
Why would he come
to Trianon Park?

07:20.006 --> 07:21.474
He wasn't with a woman.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.543
He was with a man.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.046
He drove by the main
male prostitution spot

07:27.113 --> 07:30.149
in São Paulo and parked opposite
the most famous gay disco.

07:31.017 --> 07:31.951
It makes sense.

07:39.992 --> 07:42.528
Ciro finds a guy
and takes him to the disco.

07:42.595 --> 07:46.566
According to order,
they got one drink and left.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.234
Every person entering that place

07:48.301 --> 07:50.436
fills out a form
with their email address.

07:50.503 --> 07:53.439
I found his name there,
along with other 200 names.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.674
So...

07:54.740 --> 07:57.710
I crossed his name
with other people's names

07:57.777 --> 07:59.378
on the police database

07:59.445 --> 08:01.547
and found some coincidences.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.249
-Wow!
-Good idea.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.283
Thank you.

08:04.617 --> 08:06.219
But it was Maria Júlia's idea.

08:06.586 --> 08:07.887
She found the list.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.425
Kennedy Pires, 19 years old.
Arrested for assault.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.994
He was seen quarreling
with a male prostitute

08:15.061 --> 08:16.128
at Trianon Park.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.831
So, Ciro picked him up
at Trianon Park

08:19.232 --> 08:20.566
and took him to the disco.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.935
Then they went somewhere else.
It makes sense.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.605
They must have gone to a motel.
But they had been drinking.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.940
They couldn't drive,
so left the car there

08:28.007 --> 08:29.242
and booked a car over an app.

08:29.308 --> 08:30.276
Do you have his email address?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.946
I couldn't get his password,
but, in compensation for that,

08:34.280 --> 08:35.915
I got this.

08:37.283 --> 08:38.985
Prepaid credit card.

08:39.051 --> 08:42.388
Many purchases of clothes.
Fragrances. Trips.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.324
Flight tickets. Hotels.
All of that with this card.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.260
-Raul?
-Yes?

08:47.326 --> 08:51.264
The prosecutor's wife
is at the cafe, very nervous.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.465
Okay. Waldir?

08:53.199 --> 08:55.535
When Tai finds out
about the driver that took them,

08:55.601 --> 08:56.636
try to make him talk.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.304
-The driver from the app?
-Yes.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.339
Tai, do this.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.609
Tell Maria Júlia to investigate
his criminal records.

09:03.943 --> 09:07.346
When you hack into his email,
send everything to me.

09:12.518 --> 09:13.853
Where is Ciro, Raul?

09:14.520 --> 09:16.289
Why haven't I got an answer yet?

09:16.889 --> 09:18.357
We've just started
investigating.

09:18.424 --> 09:20.226
That's not a good answer.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.528
Everything indicates
that your husband

09:23.496 --> 09:25.031
is with a male prostitute.

09:27.099 --> 09:28.434
That's crazy, Raul!

09:29.368 --> 09:31.070
Mi husband is conservative.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.573
He's known for defending
the family.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.508
He's a member
of Sociedad Brasilera...

09:35.575 --> 09:39.345
We know for sure that he was
with a male prostitute.

09:40.012 --> 09:43.249
They went together
to a gay disco in Água Branca.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.250
I want you...

09:45.217 --> 09:46.819
to promise me...

09:47.987 --> 09:49.622
this won't become public.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.327
I HACKED INTO HIS EMAIL.
HE LEFT THE DISCO BY TAXI.

09:54.393 --> 09:55.461
What's going on?

09:55.528 --> 09:57.496
HE WENT TO LIMÃO.

09:57.563 --> 09:59.599
I don't work with promises.

10:00.499 --> 10:02.635
But we'll try to do our best.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.537
Do what you have to do.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.039
Money won't be a problem.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.375
But find Ciro
before the press does.

10:17.516 --> 10:18.484
Tai?

10:25.191 --> 10:27.693
I give you 20
for the ride we won't take.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.464
And 20 more for the information
you're going to give me now.

10:31.530 --> 10:34.266
No, man. I don't meddle
in other people's lives.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.401
Keep that. I'm fine.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.136
Friend, listen to me.

10:37.670 --> 10:38.604
I have many different ways

10:38.938 --> 10:40.139
to get that information
from you.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.641
I'm choosing
the most comfortable one.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.078
I'll take one. So...

10:46.679 --> 10:49.482
Yesterday, you took
a very important passenger

10:50.082 --> 10:51.951
to a gay disco in Água Branca.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.220
I think he was with a young man.

10:55.454 --> 10:56.489
Where did they go?

10:57.023 --> 10:59.525
They guy asked me to take them
to a bar in Lapa.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.327
But he received a call.

11:01.727 --> 11:04.430
He asked me to change the route,
and I took him there.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.698
What did he say over the phone?

11:05.765 --> 11:06.699
He was angry

11:07.033 --> 11:08.501
because he didn't want
to change the route.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.137
But it seemed pretty urgent.

11:11.704 --> 11:14.273
I don't know.
The conversation was weird.

11:14.573 --> 11:16.976
They young man and him
were like two strangers.

11:17.043 --> 11:17.977
What do you mean?

11:18.611 --> 11:19.612
I don't know.

11:20.212 --> 11:22.448
The older one, who looked rich,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.383
gave the guy a weird look.

11:24.450 --> 11:25.551
Like this?

11:25.618 --> 11:27.019
No, not like that.

11:27.086 --> 11:30.056
He didn't want to sleep
with him.

11:30.122 --> 11:31.457
-No?
-He gave him a weird look.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.060
Like a sad look, you know?

11:34.126 --> 11:35.127
What did they talk about?

11:35.661 --> 11:36.729
They didn't talk.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.497
The older man
talked over the phone.

11:39.231 --> 11:41.400
But they didn't say a word
to each other.

11:41.467 --> 11:42.601
-I see.
-That's all.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.470
May I?

11:45.137 --> 11:46.105
Thanks.

11:52.411 --> 11:53.679
Have you seen the photo
I sent you?

11:56.082 --> 11:57.283
I don't like any of this.

12:02.121 --> 12:05.057
I don't know why the hell
you want to chase those guys.

12:05.124 --> 12:06.625
I heard what they were saying.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.095
They would make
a transaction today.

12:09.161 --> 12:10.396
At that parking lot.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.597
They are big.

12:11.664 --> 12:12.698
They sell to every country
in South America.

12:13.032 --> 12:15.534
And you thought that I was going
to confront them?

12:15.601 --> 12:17.203
I'm just a police officer.

12:17.269 --> 12:18.571
You shouldn't get involved
in that.

12:18.637 --> 12:22.041
If you did this, you might stop
being just a police office.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.409
Why do you give this to me?

12:23.476 --> 12:24.944
Why would I give it
to someone else?

12:28.380 --> 12:29.348
One more thing.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.686
If you work with Raul,
there are always more things.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.157
Ciro Vazquez, the prosecutor.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.159
I need his criminal "reports".

12:40.960 --> 12:42.595
You mean "records", right?

12:42.661 --> 12:43.696
I thought you were from here.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.664
I'm not.

12:45.731 --> 12:48.501
Ciro Vazquez? Isn't that the man
from that operation?

12:48.567 --> 12:50.136
"Vento no Litoral". Yes, him.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.339
He's missing?

12:53.405 --> 12:56.242
You know.
The investigation is discreet.

12:56.308 --> 12:59.278
Sure. From what I know, Vazquez
is linked to an investigation

12:59.345 --> 13:00.679
for organ trafficking.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.983
Vazquez is honest.
Nobody can buy him.

13:05.584 --> 13:07.353
Maybe he disappeared
because of that.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.327
Maria Júlia?

13:16.061 --> 13:17.930
We came to the address
that Tai sent to us.

13:20.432 --> 13:23.035
The question is,
why did Ciro changed the route?

13:23.102 --> 13:24.537
Why did he bring the kid here?

13:27.940 --> 13:29.074
It's a strange place.

13:52.965 --> 13:53.933
Hi.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.601
Hi.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.003
What can I offer you, boss?

13:58.504 --> 14:00.172
A cognac of "Alcatrão".

14:00.706 --> 14:01.674
Okay.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.146
Cold night, right? It's good
to drink something strong.

14:08.547 --> 14:10.616
Earmuffs would be good.

14:11.217 --> 14:12.251
Some cuddles...

14:12.585 --> 14:15.454
I can help you.
Just tell me what you like.

14:15.988 --> 14:18.190
Men, women, transvestites.
Just tell me.

14:19.992 --> 14:23.128
My friend was here last night.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.164
Me told me good things
about this place.

14:30.502 --> 14:33.372
I try not to meddle
in what happens in the rooms.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.475
That's why people pay for them.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.377
Does my friend always come here?

14:38.444 --> 14:41.647
First time yesterday.
He didn't belong in here.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.349
Just like you, you know?

14:47.219 --> 14:48.621
The room number is on the key.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.579
"The supreme art of war
is to subdue the enemy

15:47.646 --> 15:48.580
without even fighting.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.450
Regards from your friend R. A."

15:53.352 --> 15:54.486
Do you know this medicine?

15:57.189 --> 15:58.357
Flunitrazepam?

16:00.025 --> 16:02.027
It's a medicine
what works as a sedative.

16:03.262 --> 16:06.031
This prosecutor is linked
to organ trafficking, isn't he?

16:06.098 --> 16:08.300
Yes, we need to see if one thing
is linked to the other one.

16:09.034 --> 16:09.969
What about that book?

16:11.003 --> 16:12.604
"The Art of War", Sun Tzu.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.474
There's a dedication here.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.376
This sign...

16:17.443 --> 16:19.545
R. A. Two stars. 12QMP.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.381
R. A. First Lieutenant.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.050
Twelfth Quad
of the Military Police.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.619
You see? You are good
when you put a lot of effort.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.621
Go there tomorrow.

16:29.955 --> 16:32.424
Look for the First Lieutenant
with these initials. R. A.

16:33.292 --> 16:34.960
-¿R. A.?
-Come on, guys.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.463
If you take longer,
we'll have to pay the hour.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.353
Can I ask you something?

17:03.355 --> 17:05.057
The woman you found

17:05.691 --> 17:08.360
that's involved
in illegal adoptions...

17:08.427 --> 17:09.461
Mirtes.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.230
Do you think

17:12.131 --> 17:14.500
it will lead you to Sofia
after all these years?

17:14.566 --> 17:16.301
I don't know.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.238
I don't know if Mirtes
will lead me to Sofia, Waldir.

17:19.304 --> 17:20.973
I don't even know if she exists.

17:22.007 --> 17:22.975
I don't know anything.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.177
I tell you thins
because you need to know,

17:25.244 --> 17:27.513
if there's a small chance
to find Sofia,

17:27.579 --> 17:30.049
-you can count on me.
-I appreciate that.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.884
-Raul?
-I get it. I know.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.400
They are delayed.

18:33.011 --> 18:33.979
Damn it.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.081
Police! Put your hands up!

18:45.023 --> 18:45.991
Pull him up.

18:46.525 --> 18:48.260
Done. Here you have.

18:51.597 --> 18:52.564
Up.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.002
There's nothing for you.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.337
We will see.

19:08.413 --> 19:09.548
Let's go.

19:25.597 --> 19:26.665
Did you do all this

19:26.732 --> 19:28.333
just for illegal possession
of weapons?

19:28.400 --> 19:29.902
My lawyer takes me out tomorrow.

19:29.968 --> 19:31.503
You should worry

19:31.570 --> 19:34.039
about what your informants
are saying,

19:34.439 --> 19:36.642
not about my carrying a weapon.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.410
Let's take everyone
to the police station.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.145
Now!

19:57.563 --> 19:59.431
Damn it!

20:01.233 --> 20:02.534
Why did I open my mouth?

20:20.085 --> 20:21.053
Listen to me!

20:21.353 --> 20:23.088
What's all this?

20:23.155 --> 20:24.590
Those men have nothing!

20:25.357 --> 20:27.092
You'd better answer my calls.

20:49.047 --> 20:50.515
Do you know Mirtes?

20:53.385 --> 20:54.686
I'm not a cop.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.154
I just want to talk
about Mirtes.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.490
Hold on, man.
I'm talking to her.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.627
People are cold.
I'll help you hand them over.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.498
Mirtes used to work here
with us.

21:06.565 --> 21:08.267
But it was a long ago.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.569
Don't you know anything else
about her?

21:10.636 --> 21:12.604
She was a troubled woman.

21:13.238 --> 21:14.273
She had a huge weight...

21:15.307 --> 21:17.309
on her shoulders.

21:17.676 --> 21:20.012
She worked here for a while.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.614
I tried taking her
to the spiritualist center.

21:23.382 --> 21:24.650
Maybe she would heal.

21:24.983 --> 21:26.518
But she said it was useless.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.121
Are you close to her?

21:30.756 --> 21:31.890
Somehow I am.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.360
Last time I knew about her,

21:36.561 --> 21:39.197
she was living
in a nursing home.

21:40.265 --> 21:41.967
Do you know where?

21:46.471 --> 21:47.639
It's very cold.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.042
-Thanks!
-Amazing, Waldir.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.277
Take the small one. I'm thirsty.

21:54.212 --> 21:55.614
Where are Raul and Maria Júlia?

21:56.281 --> 21:57.983
They can't be in a motel.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.586
I'm not so sure!

22:02.254 --> 22:03.689
Why? Did she say anything, Tai?

22:05.991 --> 22:06.958
Tai?

22:07.659 --> 22:08.627
Tai?

22:09.161 --> 22:11.096
I like you!

22:11.163 --> 22:13.065
Carolina is pretty.

22:13.131 --> 22:14.199
HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?

22:14.266 --> 22:17.035
Go on a date with her.
Just drop your phone.

22:17.102 --> 22:18.203
-Yes, right?
-Yes.

22:18.270 --> 22:21.573
Yes. I will.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.342
I'm leaving. Bye.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.310
Bye.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.356
-We never...
-No.

22:38.557 --> 22:39.691
I think not.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.993
We've been working together
for so long

22:42.394 --> 22:44.629
and we never had a drink
just the two of us.

22:46.398 --> 22:47.366
We didn't.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.236
But if you have to go,
don't worry. I'm good.

22:51.303 --> 22:52.337
No. Of course not.

22:53.138 --> 22:54.940
I was thinking about getting
something stronger.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.509
I love it.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.679
Have you ever tried
the "submarino"?

23:00.746 --> 23:03.315
No, but I'm open to new things.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.954
CANDY PALACE

23:11.256 --> 23:12.224
Hi, Guiomar.

23:15.093 --> 23:16.061
Come in.

23:16.628 --> 23:17.596
Are you okay, dear?

23:18.764 --> 23:20.599
You never asked me
to come here before.

23:20.665 --> 23:21.600
What happened?

23:25.637 --> 23:27.105
I needed to talk to you.

23:30.108 --> 23:31.076
I want to know...

23:34.246 --> 23:35.213
Who is my dad?

23:36.314 --> 23:38.016
Who is the man on this photo?

23:40.218 --> 23:43.488
Who is he? A criminal?
A hero? A bastard?

23:43.555 --> 23:46.158
-Who is he?
-Your dad was an ordinary man.

23:47.659 --> 23:50.495
He had virtues, temptations.

23:51.363 --> 23:52.330
Melina?

23:52.731 --> 23:54.466
You don't what it's like
to be chased

23:54.533 --> 23:56.701
during ten or 15 years
of your life,

23:56.768 --> 23:57.869
to be in a war.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.073
Your dad fought by my side
in the trenches.

24:02.140 --> 24:04.209
In the underground
of the struggle.

24:05.644 --> 24:06.912
It was not easy!

24:09.014 --> 24:10.515
I saw that man

24:11.416 --> 24:12.484
switching sides.

24:13.552 --> 24:15.921
Doubting. Selling weapons.

24:18.156 --> 24:19.124
Who is he?

24:21.026 --> 24:21.960
Both.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.296
You can't choose.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.393
VÀNIA PIRES
SPECIALIZED ATTORNEY

24:57.963 --> 24:59.498
MILITARY POLICE
LIST OF THE ONES WHO PASSED

25:12.110 --> 25:13.078
Raul?

25:13.979 --> 25:15.947
Write down the address
of Kennedy's mother.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.586
Why are you in a hurry?

25:21.653 --> 25:23.955
Don't you feel the need to know
what we will find out?

25:28.460 --> 25:29.528
Hi, Waldir.

25:29.594 --> 25:32.297
I talked to a guy,
First Lieutenant Roberto Aguia.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.267
R. A.? The initials
on the book, right?

25:35.333 --> 25:36.401
Exactly.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.303
Some time ago,
he gave that book as a gift

25:38.370 --> 25:40.071
to Sergeant Torres,

25:40.138 --> 25:42.274
a good man with a family
that never gets in trouble.

25:42.340 --> 25:44.175
I don't know how Torres
is linked to this case.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.378
I guess you have Torres' numbe.

25:46.444 --> 25:48.113
Number and address, boss.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.348
Send the information
to Maria Júlia's phone, please.

25:53.018 --> 25:54.553
It's the same address
that we're heading to.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.322
-What?
-It's the same address.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.390
It's Vânia's house.

26:03.295 --> 26:04.229
Hi, Kennedy.

26:14.172 --> 26:16.141
Did you know Ciro already,

26:16.541 --> 26:19.277
or did you meet
for the first time on Friday?

26:19.344 --> 26:22.280
I never looked for him.
My mom told me not to,

26:23.348 --> 26:24.516
She told me he was an authorit,

26:25.550 --> 26:27.919
that people like us should
just look down and shut up.

26:29.154 --> 26:30.121
I never had a father.

26:31.189 --> 26:32.190
I learnt to live like that.

26:33.058 --> 26:34.025
Wait.

26:40.732 --> 26:44.369
That man got Vânia pregnant
when she was 16.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.171
He abandoned them.

26:46.237 --> 26:48.473
He was too important
to take charge.

26:50.642 --> 26:52.043
And pay for the milk.

26:52.344 --> 26:55.180
He showed up here,
said some guys were after him.

26:56.014 --> 26:59.317
He needed to talk to the kid.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.686
I talked to Vânia,

27:01.753 --> 27:03.521
and we thought
we'd better be alert.

27:03.822 --> 27:07.025
If those guys learnt
Kennedy is his son,

27:07.092 --> 27:08.727
they could use him as a bait.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.695
-Vânia...?
-We are not married.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.631
We've been living together
for a long time.

27:12.964 --> 27:16.534
We wanted him to have
a good upbringing, but still...

27:16.601 --> 27:19.104
I might have been my last chane
to talk to my father.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.339
I give you a house,

27:21.406 --> 27:22.474
I give you food,

27:22.540 --> 27:24.909
and your father
is the one that's perfect now?

27:26.344 --> 27:27.545
I never judged anyone.

27:28.213 --> 27:30.615
Not even him and his life.

27:30.682 --> 27:31.616
Uncle!

27:32.851 --> 27:34.552
I wanted to know if I could tak
to Kennedy in private.

27:36.221 --> 27:37.155
What do you say, Kennedy?

27:39.724 --> 27:42.961
Do you know how Ciro found out
where you were?

27:43.695 --> 27:45.230
How did you know
where to find you?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.135
Talk to me, Kennedy.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.105
If you don't do it here,

27:54.172 --> 27:56.574
we'll have talk
in front of your stepfather.

27:56.641 --> 27:57.676
No.

27:57.742 --> 27:59.477
My uncle can't know what I do.

28:02.113 --> 28:03.081
Nobody knows.

28:03.748 --> 28:06.084
When he and my mom
found out I was gay,

28:08.019 --> 28:09.387
they started controlling
all the time.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.626
On the weekend,
he's at the station.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.861
And my mother sleeps deeply.

28:17.395 --> 28:18.430
I always sneak out.

28:19.497 --> 28:21.433
That's the only way
I get to make money.

28:22.901 --> 28:23.835
It's difficult.

28:24.302 --> 28:25.804
I don't think
you know what it's like.

28:27.105 --> 28:28.406
To have a double life.

28:29.474 --> 28:31.543
Not to be able to say
who you really are.

28:37.515 --> 28:39.250
And what about Ciro?

28:39.317 --> 28:40.251
He's a friend.

28:41.019 --> 28:43.221
He said they've been asking
about me.

28:43.688 --> 28:46.424
Since he's a prosecutor,
he said I was interested.

28:46.958 --> 28:48.159
And he gave them
the information.

28:50.028 --> 28:51.896
When he arrived there,
did you recognize him?

28:52.263 --> 28:53.465
I didn't.

28:53.531 --> 28:55.200
I thought he was a client.

28:55.266 --> 28:56.534
Why did you take him
to the disco?

28:57.969 --> 29:01.239
We receive a commission
for what a client consumes.

29:02.507 --> 29:03.508
That's why I took him there.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.277
What about the room?

29:06.344 --> 29:08.213
I didn't know him.
Actually, my father...

29:08.947 --> 29:09.914
Ciro.

29:10.448 --> 29:12.083
Ciro was going to take me
to a bar.

29:12.650 --> 29:15.653
He received a call
and got really upset.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.422
He asked the driver
to change the route.

29:18.156 --> 29:20.625
When we entered the room,
he searched for some things.

29:20.692 --> 29:23.228
-What things?
-He didn't tell me either.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.631
When we finished talking,
I left.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.133
He stayed there, alone.

29:28.199 --> 29:29.567
And I forgot my book there.

29:30.135 --> 29:32.070
I showed him some things
from my uncle.

29:33.872 --> 29:34.839
I see.

29:35.673 --> 29:36.908
It's okay, Kennedy.

29:36.975 --> 29:38.109
Of course, sir.

29:38.176 --> 29:40.211
Don't worry.
I'll set the Argentinians free.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.212
There's no...

29:48.319 --> 29:49.587
Yes, sir. That's correct.

29:50.288 --> 29:53.358
Yes. It was a reliable source,
but unfortunately...

29:58.496 --> 30:00.198
That bastard hang up on me.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.101
And you? What do you want?

30:05.203 --> 30:08.540
I know I've been asking
too much lately, right?

30:09.440 --> 30:12.677
The truth is, we've been workig
really well at the agency.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.515
Here is what you asked for,
for a change.

30:20.418 --> 30:22.153
I called a friend in Homicides.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.057
They arrested two men
for the murder of a prosecutor

30:26.124 --> 30:27.058
two months ago.

30:27.358 --> 30:30.228
This prosecutor
worked with Ciro Vazquez

30:30.628 --> 30:33.464
at the organ trafficking
task force.

30:35.066 --> 30:37.168
But one of them
was set free last week

30:37.235 --> 30:38.469
on a writ of habeas corpus.

30:42.307 --> 30:44.609
Delcio Tavares, known as Xerif.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.555
They are about to mess up.

32:06.024 --> 32:07.158
It looks like it.

32:11.029 --> 32:11.996
What's that?

32:12.630 --> 32:13.598
What?

32:16.367 --> 32:17.302
It's Kennedy.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.873
It looks like
he's about to mess up as well.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.308
Damn it!

32:23.942 --> 32:25.009
I'll talk to him.

32:25.076 --> 32:26.244
What are you doing here?

32:26.311 --> 32:29.080
The question is,
what are you doing here?

32:29.147 --> 32:31.482
I came to look for my father.
I want to know if he came back.

32:32.317 --> 32:34.152
Listen, we were hired
to do that.

32:34.218 --> 32:36.421
You need to wait back home,
where you are safe.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.656
Would you wait
if it was your father?

32:38.723 --> 32:41.125
I've spent 19 years
waiting to meet him.

32:41.192 --> 32:42.627
When I finally got to it,
he disappeared.

32:44.028 --> 32:46.364
Kid, go home. Wait for me ther.
I'll let you know.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.433
Wait!

33:26.971 --> 33:28.039
-Calm down!
-Hold on.

33:28.106 --> 33:29.040
Calm down.

33:30.208 --> 33:31.976
-What are you doing here?
-Where's my father?

33:32.043 --> 33:33.311
-Calm.
-Where is he?

33:33.378 --> 33:35.446
-Tell me where he is!
-What are you doing? Let him g.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.215
-Tell me where he is!
-Calm!

33:37.281 --> 33:39.250
-Breathe.
-We'll find your father.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.069
What the hell is this, Raul?

33:58.136 --> 33:59.604
What's going on? Tell me!

33:59.937 --> 34:01.572
-Kennedy!
-It's my father!

34:01.639 --> 34:03.341
-Is my father in there?
-No!

34:03.408 --> 34:04.609
-It's my father!
-It's not!

34:04.675 --> 34:05.910
It's not your father!

34:06.677 --> 34:07.612
It's not your father!

34:08.079 --> 34:09.047
Let's get out of here.

34:15.586 --> 34:16.921
What it going to happen to him?

34:17.655 --> 34:20.191
The paramedics
said he lost a lot of blood.

34:21.325 --> 34:22.293
Where's my father?

34:23.561 --> 34:24.962
I still don't know, Kennedy.

34:25.563 --> 34:26.631
I'm sorry.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.166
What the hell was that?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.302
Dama, we were looking
for a client,

34:31.369 --> 34:33.404
but we came across this.

34:33.471 --> 34:36.474
I can't believe
you always get in trouble.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.443
Dama, I was doing my job.

34:38.509 --> 34:40.578
I didn't know I'd find a man
with a missing kidney

34:40.645 --> 34:41.712
in a bath tub.

34:41.779 --> 34:43.247
I'll take you to the station.

34:43.314 --> 34:45.516
You are all witnesses
of attempted murder.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.286
Or just murder! I don't know
if he's going to live.

34:48.352 --> 34:49.387
-Let's go.
-Dama.

34:49.454 --> 34:51.122
The kid has no father.
Have a little compassion.

34:51.189 --> 34:52.290
I'll go talk to him quickly.

34:56.527 --> 34:59.063
Don't you think we should talk
about the Argentinians?

35:00.398 --> 35:02.567
You told me they were worse
than Pablo Escobar.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.635
They didn't even have weed
in their suitcases.

35:05.069 --> 35:06.604
-I'm sorry, Dama.
-Listen to me, girl!

35:07.371 --> 35:10.408
I don't know what your plan is,
but if you think you can use m,

35:10.475 --> 35:11.442
forget about it.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.946
You'll have me to deal with
if you do it again.

35:21.018 --> 35:21.953
Damn it!

35:29.327 --> 35:30.294
Hi, Melina.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.400
What are you doing here?

35:36.467 --> 35:38.603
You used to call me "godfather.

35:40.338 --> 35:41.405
I liked that.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.243
Now you turn me in
to the police.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.277
Time goes by.

35:47.545 --> 35:48.579
People change.

35:48.646 --> 35:50.414
You're very courageous, Melina.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.250
You thought
I'd never find out about you.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.652
Your men should have done
a better job

35:54.719 --> 35:55.620
when they ran over me.

35:55.953 --> 35:57.488
I didn't order that.

35:58.422 --> 36:00.191
I would never do that
to my niece.

36:00.258 --> 36:03.127
Next time, Ramírez,
you'd better get me killed.

36:04.695 --> 36:06.297
As long as I live...

36:06.364 --> 36:08.266
You didn't understand
anything, Melina!

36:08.733 --> 36:10.501
You're so young.

36:11.702 --> 36:15.072
Do you think if wanted to,
you'd still be breathing?

36:16.073 --> 36:17.175
I don't want to kill you.

36:18.676 --> 36:19.877
I never did.

36:21.045 --> 36:22.313
I love you.

36:23.681 --> 36:24.615
I saw you grow up.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.018
Tell me, then.

36:29.720 --> 36:30.955
Where's my father?

36:35.293 --> 36:37.562
Your partner. Your friend.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.965
You killed him, bastard!

36:41.365 --> 36:42.300
I killed him?

36:43.334 --> 36:44.368
Are you mad, Melina?

36:44.669 --> 36:48.139
I'd never kill Oscar.
He just ran away from all of u.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.474
From me too.

36:52.143 --> 36:54.178
Who do you think
your father is, Melina?

36:58.583 --> 37:01.285
He gave this to me.
Actually, he didn't.

37:03.654 --> 37:06.290
I just found out
he wanted to give it to me.

37:11.696 --> 37:12.964
Look for your father.

37:15.132 --> 37:16.100
It's fair.

37:17.535 --> 37:18.936
I would look for him too.

37:23.107 --> 37:24.175
But forget about me.

37:26.510 --> 37:29.614
I'm not a man
you should mess with.

37:57.341 --> 37:59.977
Who is being kept in there?
Is it Ciro?

38:00.645 --> 38:01.646
I don't know. Maybe.

38:03.147 --> 38:04.315
What are we going to do?

38:08.619 --> 38:09.553
What?

38:38.282 --> 38:40.351
-What are you doing, Waldir?
-Waldir!

38:40.418 --> 38:41.352
Damn it!

38:46.657 --> 38:49.093
-What are you doing?
-We'll make them talk.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.195
I know I sometimes
like playing thug,

38:51.262 --> 38:53.164
but there must be
another man inside.

38:53.230 --> 38:54.665
Yes, Ciro,
with half of his organs

38:54.732 --> 38:56.167
being kept in a cooler with ic.

38:57.401 --> 38:58.903
I don't recognize you, Raul.
Shall we?

38:59.503 --> 39:00.604
Don't slack off now!

39:46.884 --> 39:48.619
Put your hands up! Turn around!

39:48.953 --> 39:50.454
Get off! Don't you dare!

39:50.521 --> 39:52.189
Get off! Now!

39:52.256 --> 39:53.257
-Stand there.
-Come on.

39:53.591 --> 39:54.558
Stand there.

39:54.892 --> 39:55.860
There.

39:56.260 --> 39:57.228
Waldir.

39:58.462 --> 39:59.430
I'm going in.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.332
To the back!

40:01.399 --> 40:02.533
To the back of the truck.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.335
Come on. Come on, kittens.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.054
Don't move!

40:24.121 --> 40:25.055
Walk.

40:25.389 --> 40:27.258
Walk. There. Open the door.

40:31.695 --> 40:34.298
All of you, against the wall.
Put your hands up.

40:34.365 --> 40:35.299
Now!

40:44.208 --> 40:45.376
Put your hands up!

40:51.949 --> 40:54.351
We got you at last, bastards!

41:22.379 --> 41:23.347
Are you okay?

41:24.748 --> 41:25.950
Let me untie you.

41:30.421 --> 41:32.156
Are you okay? Come here, Ciro!

41:55.212 --> 41:57.414
You must be the two people
who cause me more trouble.

41:58.415 --> 42:00.150
We facilitate you this arrest

42:00.217 --> 42:02.553
and dismantle
an organ trafficking gang,

42:02.620 --> 42:04.255
and you complain? For real?

42:05.990 --> 42:08.125
Let me tell you
I completely agree with Raul.

42:14.598 --> 42:15.566
Raul?

42:17.735 --> 42:19.103
I want to say sorry.

42:21.305 --> 42:22.907
You've been very nice to me.

42:25.075 --> 42:28.045
Nice, but in a strange way.

42:31.015 --> 42:32.483
I should have told you
about my father

42:32.550 --> 42:34.685
and the investigation
I'm carrying.

42:35.019 --> 42:36.153
And the accident.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.522
I'm sorry.

42:41.258 --> 42:43.294
In "Ausentes", we all have

42:43.994 --> 42:45.996
our ghosts, our demons.

42:46.664 --> 42:49.333
Nobody asks too many questions,
and we all move forward.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.269
But we never lie to each other.

42:52.736 --> 42:53.871
You know?

42:58.008 --> 42:58.943
Would you like a candy?

43:00.110 --> 43:01.245
No, thanks.

43:01.312 --> 43:03.113
Your life is bitter enough
already, Maria Júlia.

43:09.119 --> 43:10.087
How do you feel?

43:11.355 --> 43:12.323
Alive.

43:20.564 --> 43:21.532
Dad!

43:27.237 --> 43:28.205
I'm sorry, son.

43:29.106 --> 43:32.409
If you let me try,
give me a chance.

43:32.476 --> 43:34.078
I can try to be

43:34.678 --> 43:36.013
your friend.

43:36.714 --> 43:38.415
I can try to be your father.

43:41.051 --> 43:41.986
I'm sorry.

43:43.487 --> 43:45.089
I'm happy you're alive, dad.

43:46.423 --> 43:47.391
Ciro.

43:57.601 --> 43:58.535
What about Lígia?

44:00.337 --> 44:03.073
On Thursday, she went sleep
all crazy like she is.

44:03.574 --> 44:05.909
On Friday, she woke up,
and her husband was missing.

44:06.377 --> 44:08.012
On Saturday, she found out
his husband was gay

44:08.078 --> 44:09.279
and was with a male prostitute.

44:09.346 --> 44:10.381
Nothing happened on Sunday.

44:10.447 --> 44:12.082
What does she find out
on Monday?

44:12.149 --> 44:14.118
That her husband is the father
of a male prostitute.

44:14.451 --> 44:16.954
Isn't it the craziest weekend
of her life?

44:18.355 --> 44:20.391
-You're going to tell her that.
-Me?

44:20.457 --> 44:21.592
No. Maria Júlia.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.093
No, Waldir. You go.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.229
You need to take credit
for this.

44:25.295 --> 44:26.964
You can be
a sensitive person too.

44:28.532 --> 44:30.134
I think she is flattering me.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.368
-Let's go.
-Is she flattering me?

44:33.971 --> 44:35.272
You are stuck-up,
aren't you, Waldir?

45:05.536 --> 45:06.637
Come here, son.

45:15.412 --> 45:17.214
I know why you are here.

45:20.617 --> 45:22.086
I know what you're looking for.

45:22.152 --> 45:22.286
I know what you're looking for.
