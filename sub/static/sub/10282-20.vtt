00:05.773 --> 00:07.208
Previously on ER:

00:07.241 --> 00:08.642
Church?

00:08.676 --> 00:10.078
Yeah, my niece
is getting baptized.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.279
I have to hold her.

00:11.312 --> 00:12.646
Oh, you're
the godfather.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.648
You know, tenure means
financial security.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.350
Tenured attendings
need to demonstrate

00:16.384 --> 00:17.618
the ability to carry
their own weight.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.387
You mean bring in grant money.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.755
We would be interested in
covering the construction cost.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.124
The entire thing?

00:23.157 --> 00:24.492
I had a gig.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.694
Screw your gig!
Medicine isn't a day job.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.263
The chief resident
in a busy urban ER.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.099
We're not giving it
to him though, right?

00:31.132 --> 00:32.133
We're considering it.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.367
Are you out of your mind?

( groaning )

00:52.720 --> 00:56.624
( sighing )

00:56.657 --> 00:58.192
Hi.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.827
Mm, hey.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.329
Whatcha doing
down there?

01:01.362 --> 01:03.864
I don't know.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.599
Get back up here.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.535
Oh, man, I can't.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.304
I want to, I do,
but I gotta jam.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.206
What, you got gigs
during the day?

01:12.240 --> 01:15.176
Different gig.
I'm a doctor.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.677
( chuckling ):
Oh, yeah, right.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.179
No, really.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.613
I am,
I work at County,

01:19.647 --> 01:21.315
and I'm looking
at a 12-hour shift

01:21.349 --> 01:23.317
that starts in
29 minutes, so...

01:23.351 --> 01:24.818
You want some?

01:24.852 --> 01:26.720
Better
than coffee.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.390
Still, I gotta pass.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.459
Oh, 'cause you're
a doctor?

01:31.492 --> 01:32.460
( snorts )

01:32.493 --> 01:34.362
Pretty much, yeah.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.464
That's one sucky
day job you got.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.232
Hmm...

01:40.501 --> 01:42.170
Ha! That's what I'm
talking about, baby.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.437
Yeah?
What you know
about that?

01:43.471 --> 01:44.638
Shut up and
listen to this.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.440
Man, you ready to go
to school, baby?

01:46.474 --> 01:47.675
You ready to get
an education?

01:47.708 --> 01:48.742
Now show me something.
Okay.

01:48.776 --> 01:49.877
( grunting )

01:51.545 --> 01:52.913
Hey, yo...

01:52.946 --> 01:54.715
who you bringing
to that party tonight?

01:54.748 --> 01:57.518
What party?

01:57.551 --> 01:59.453
You serious?

01:59.487 --> 02:00.721
Darnell's 30th, man.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.223
Aw, man...

02:02.256 --> 02:03.791
Oh, let me guess: you too busy.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.493
Hey, I wouldn't be out here
at 7:00 in the morning

02:05.526 --> 02:06.827
whipping you ass if I wasn't.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.362
You ain't been back
in a while, man.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.363
Hey, like you said,

02:09.396 --> 02:11.832
I'm a busy man.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.734
Okay...

02:13.767 --> 02:15.669
Doc Ain't Got Time
for My Friends--

02:15.703 --> 02:17.805
I make this shot,
you're dragging

02:17.838 --> 02:19.507
your sorry ass
to that party tonight.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.708
Yeah, right, like
that's gonna happen.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.510
Okay.
Come on, show me something.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.611
Come on. It's crunch time.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.213
Don't be a bum out there.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.247
Show me something.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.817
Crunch time,
baby.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.519
Game over.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.620
KOVAC:
Hey, Sam.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.787
SAM:
Yeah?

02:33.821 --> 02:35.523
Out of shaving gel.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.825
Uh, bottom drawer
on the right.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.460
Um...

02:39.493 --> 02:42.763
Alex, move it!
Carpool's here.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.801
You find it?

02:47.835 --> 02:50.504
Um, still looking.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.346
It's all the way
in the back.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.447
What?

02:59.480 --> 03:00.781
The shaving gel.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.922
You almost done in here then?

03:08.956 --> 03:12.426
Yeah, go ahead if you need to.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.629
Oh, nah, I can wait.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.268
( knocking )

03:20.301 --> 03:21.335
She in?

03:21.369 --> 03:22.936
Uh, let me check.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.773
Make sure these QA files
get to Anspaugh ASAP,

03:25.806 --> 03:28.476
and I need five copies
of this budget, collated.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.478
Oh, and call Surgery again,
tell them I'm still waiting

03:30.511 --> 03:32.813
for their M&M data and
I'm not happy about it.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.515
Yes, ma'am.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.884
This coffee
tastes like crap.

03:36.917 --> 03:40.020
Doesn't anyone change
filters around here?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.922
Sorry. New assistant.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.491
Good help, you know?

03:43.524 --> 03:45.326
Hard to find.

03:45.359 --> 03:48.696
So, um, the formal announcement
will come out later today,

03:48.729 --> 03:51.465
but I wanted to tell
you the news myself.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.834
You've been awarded tenure.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.503
Seriously?

03:55.536 --> 03:57.705
Yup. Congratulations.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.543
Wow.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.011
Wow, that's great.

04:04.044 --> 04:07.415
I just, I wasn't expecting it
until next year or so.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.917
Nonsense, you've earned it.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.920
Well, thank you, Kerry.
That means a lot to me.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.756
Sure. I still have some other
notifications to make today,

04:15.789 --> 04:18.326
so if you could just keep
this on a need-to-know basis.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.959
After all, you got
the next 30 years

04:19.993 --> 04:21.595
to gloat about it, right?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.886
( music playing )

05:22.990 --> 05:25.092
What, you don't
like that station?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.894
It's fine.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.429
You feel okay today?

05:28.462 --> 05:30.063
Yeah. Why?

05:30.097 --> 05:33.100
Well, you were in the
bathroom a long time.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.436
No longer than usual.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.713
So was it positive
or negative?

05:49.049 --> 05:51.084
Negative.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.086
Were you going
to say anything?

05:53.120 --> 05:56.890
I... was worried.
I checked. I was wrong.

05:56.924 --> 06:00.428
What is there to say?

06:00.428 --> 06:01.929
What, you'd rather
I was pregnant?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.997
I'd rather you
didn't keep secrets.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.535
Yeah, that's funny,
coming from you.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.969
What's that
supposed to mean?

06:09.002 --> 06:10.738
You've seen all
of my dirty laundry.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.440
I barely know
a thing about you.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.441
That's not true.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.608
You don't talk, Luka.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.076
About what?
About anything.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.745
How am I supposed to know

06:17.778 --> 06:18.946
when you're being honest
when you don't talk?

06:18.979 --> 06:20.147
About what?
I'm not the one

06:20.180 --> 06:21.715
who lied about
a pregnancy test.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.551
I didn't lie.
Yeah, fine,
you omitted.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.918
Like you don't?

06:24.952 --> 06:27.955
What? What?
What do I omit?

06:27.988 --> 06:29.990
Your past.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.460
Your family.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.462
I should check
traffic.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.469
( sighs )

06:41.469 --> 06:43.471
Uh... Neela.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.205
Cat litter ingestion,
uncontrollable drooling.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.541
Drooling?
Yep. Either that

06:47.575 --> 06:49.477
or a butt abscess
on a 300-pounder, your choice.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.611
Drooler, thank you.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.879
Labs are back on Mr. Busto.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.747
All right, hang
500 of Levaquin.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.550
And Eugene Bradley's here
complaining about pain again.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.218
Here without
a parent.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.120
Morris, see what this
kid's deal is today.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.522
Bet it's the same
as last month--

07:01.555 --> 07:02.756
"My pills
don't work, Doc."

07:02.790 --> 07:04.758
Or last week,
"I lost the bottle."

07:04.792 --> 07:06.994
There's always, "When the pain's
this bad, I gotta have my IV."

07:07.027 --> 07:08.529
We can't blame him, really.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.897
His disease has made him
narcotic-dependent.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.198
AKA an addict.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.800
No, there's a difference.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.868
And we take complaints
here seriously, so go.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.837
Isn't it Abby's turn
to treat this turkey?

07:16.870 --> 07:18.506
Abby's at some family
thing with Jake.

07:18.506 --> 07:19.873
Looks like it's
your turn, big guy.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.842
RAY:
TMJ's going out
on NSAIDS, five-year-old

07:21.875 --> 07:24.211
gastro tolerated the PO
challenge and gram stain's

07:24.244 --> 07:25.245
negative on the knee effusion,

07:25.278 --> 07:27.014
home and ortho
follow-up.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.517
Gonna start calling you
"The Closer," man, all right.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.519
Hey, kid over there?
Sickle cell.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.953
Little bit of pain,
here without his mother.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.254
Get his story, call
the Heme Clinic,

07:34.287 --> 07:35.789
give them a heads-up.

07:35.823 --> 07:36.957
If it's non-emergent,
send him home.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.092
Sure.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.195
Anyone ever tell you
you got a cruel streak?

07:42.229 --> 07:43.631
Hey, have you seen
Lewis around?

07:43.664 --> 07:44.832
No, she's hiding out.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.534
Uh, but congrats,
by the way.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.869
Associate Professor
of Emergency Medicine--

07:48.902 --> 07:50.871
nice ring to it.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.039
How did you, um...

07:52.072 --> 07:54.608
Uh, just...

07:54.642 --> 07:56.877
Who's "CoryB123"?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.879
Uh, just someone
on my IM buddy list.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.681
Uh, a celebration
is in order, yeah?

08:00.714 --> 08:03.551
Yeah, well, it's not
exactly official yet...

08:03.584 --> 08:05.919
"JerrBear99..."
so keep it quiet

08:05.953 --> 08:08.622
and off the Internet.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.058
Good news
needs to be shared.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.794
My mom's at work,
but she told me to come.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.563
Well, it's a good pulse,

08:15.563 --> 08:17.731
minimal swelling, it
doesn't look that bad.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.199
But unfortunately,

08:19.232 --> 08:20.968
we can't treat you
without her consent.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.970
I brought a note from her.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.973
Unless it's an emergency,
we need the real deal, man.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.676
Look, it hurts really
bad this time.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.911
Real bad, you know?

08:30.944 --> 08:32.780
What are you
taking for it?

08:32.813 --> 08:36.183
Morphine, but most of the time
the pills are just a waste,

08:36.216 --> 08:38.619
and my mom says
I probably need an IV.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.855
Mm-hmm, okay, well,
I tell you what I'm going to do.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.591
I'm going to get you
a couple of taxi vouchers.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.792
Yeah, you're going
to go home,

08:44.825 --> 08:46.159
you're going
to take your pills

08:46.193 --> 08:48.596
and you're going
to stay off your feet.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.164
Now if you're still in pain
when your mom gets home,
have her bring you back.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.833
Then I'm just gonna
have to wait again.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.234
And you just ask
for Dr. Barnett.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.604
Bring you
right in, okay?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.606
CARTER:
You getting organized on us?

08:58.606 --> 09:00.741
These two shelves,
free samples,

09:00.774 --> 09:02.610
those two cabinets have
all been alphabetized,

09:02.610 --> 09:05.278
benzos and narcotics here
and actually locked up.

09:05.312 --> 09:08.315
If only I could do
this with my kitchen.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.217
What's going on?

09:10.250 --> 09:11.785
Nothing.

09:11.819 --> 09:12.953
Has Kerry
found you yet?

09:12.986 --> 09:14.822
No, I haven't seen her. Why?

09:14.855 --> 09:16.990
'Cause they're making
the tenure announcements today.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.796
And you're not
the only one getting it.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.636
What?

09:28.636 --> 09:29.970
When did this happen?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.905
Just now.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.675
No, I mean, when did you apply?

09:34.708 --> 09:36.009
Are you surprised?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.845
No, of course not.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.880
Of course you get tenure.
You're great.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.282
I just thought you said you were
going to wait a couple years.

09:42.315 --> 09:46.754
Yeah, well, they kind of
encouraged me to apply early.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.822
Really?

09:48.856 --> 09:52.092
They didn't encourage me
to apply at all.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.295
Well, she's probably been trying
to find you all morning.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.831
Well, I've been in here
busting my ass.

09:57.865 --> 10:01.969
Yeah, 'cause you're dedicated
to reorganizing the drugs.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.371
Or is it because
you're avoiding Morris?

10:04.404 --> 10:06.239
Complaining of nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea....

10:06.273 --> 10:08.008
right flank pain...
Flu. It's the flu.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.376
( groans )

10:09.409 --> 10:11.344
All right,
I'll tell him.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.113
Give the patellar
fracture

10:13.146 --> 10:14.715
a shot of Toradol.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.216
I can't stand hearing
her whine anymore.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.350
Isn't Toradol
contraindicated

10:17.384 --> 10:19.019
since she's
going to the OR?

10:19.052 --> 10:20.788
Um, if you're busy,
I can find Dr. Pratt.

10:20.821 --> 10:21.889
Morris?

10:21.922 --> 10:23.123
Stay here.
Don't move.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.692
I'm here for you,
okay, buddy?

10:24.725 --> 10:25.693
What up, Chief?

10:25.726 --> 10:26.994
Uh, we need to talk.

10:33.834 --> 10:34.935
Okay, if this is about

10:34.968 --> 10:36.704
the lady who refused
a pap smear...

10:36.737 --> 10:37.771
You're the new
Chief Resident.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.309
Oh, my God. Oh...

10:42.342 --> 10:44.077
This is fantastic.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.245
Thank you,
thank you.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.214
Thank you, thank
you, Dr. Lewis.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.082
Wait until my old man
hears about this.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.951
He will eat his words!
However, it is on
a provisional basis.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.053
Slacker, ha!
There'll be
a three-month
probation period,

10:53.086 --> 10:54.855
during which you'll receive
additional training.
I knew my presentation

10:54.888 --> 10:57.024
on the Circadian...
I'll be your
supervisor for that.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.092
I could feel the roo...
Morris, are you listening?

10:59.126 --> 11:01.361
It is so gratifying
to see that, that

11:01.394 --> 11:03.731
meritocracy is alive
and well at County.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.432
That hard work
is rewarded

11:05.465 --> 11:07.100
and that an
individual's ability

11:07.134 --> 11:09.737
is valued over
politics, wealth

11:09.770 --> 11:11.438
and the proverbial
old boy's club.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.040
( grunts )

11:13.073 --> 11:14.107
Right.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.408
You start today.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.910
Yes. I do.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.812
Yeah.

11:18.846 --> 11:19.980
Hey, Jerry, do
I have any messages?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.381
Nope.
Are you sure?

11:21.414 --> 11:23.016
Have I ever given you
reason to doubt me?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.017
ER.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.252
Kitty litter
connoisseur

11:25.285 --> 11:26.453
given Benadryl,
drooling stopped.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.821
Suggested she get
a dog instead.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.757
Hey, Pratt, some
guy on line one.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.092
Says the party's at 8:00 and
that ball had too much bounce.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.761
Tell him a bet's a bet.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.062
Excellent as always, Neela.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.463
Pleurocentesis
going upstairs,

11:36.496 --> 11:37.798
need you to sign off.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.099
Hey, whatever
happened with Eugene?

11:39.132 --> 11:40.433
Sickle cell kid?
Sent him home.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.402
Really?
Then what's he still doing here?

11:42.435 --> 11:44.104
Morris didn't
tell you, huh?

11:45.839 --> 11:47.174
Tell me what?

11:47.207 --> 11:48.809
Eugene's
a frequent flyer.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.277
Yeah, the kid knows how
to work the system.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.145
Hey, Morris.
Hang on, kiddo.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.981
Can I have
your attention, please?

11:54.014 --> 11:57.885
Uh, I am very proud to announce
that effective immediately,

11:57.918 --> 12:00.187
I am your new Chief Resident.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.524
This is a joke, right?

12:04.557 --> 12:05.993
What?
You didn't want it.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.294
Explosion and fire
in apartment house.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.361
16 casualties,

12:08.395 --> 12:09.362
seven critical,
two minutes out.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.998
Okay, okay, nurses...

12:11.031 --> 12:12.465
restock the trauma
rooms, med students

12:12.499 --> 12:13.533
find an intern,

12:13.566 --> 12:14.534
docs at the ready--

12:14.567 --> 12:17.437
everybody move out.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.907
I wonder what Abby's gonna say
when she finds out about this.

12:19.940 --> 12:20.908
ABBY:
...Jesus Christ.

12:20.941 --> 12:21.909
ALL:
Amen.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.510
Amen.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.178
PRIEST:
Do you reject Satan
and all his works

12:25.212 --> 12:26.513
and all his
empty promises?

12:26.546 --> 12:28.148
I do.
I do.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.317
Do you believe in God,
the Father almighty,

12:30.350 --> 12:31.384
creator of heaven and Earth?

12:31.418 --> 12:32.385
I do.
I do.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.821
You all right?

12:33.821 --> 12:35.022
Do you believe
in Jesus Christ...

12:35.055 --> 12:36.523
( clears throat )

12:36.556 --> 12:38.225
Do you believe
in Jesus Christ

12:38.258 --> 12:39.559
his only Son, our Lord,

12:39.592 --> 12:41.061
who was born of
the Virgin Mary

12:41.094 --> 12:42.329
was crucified, died

12:42.362 --> 12:44.164
and was buried,
rose from the dead,

12:44.197 --> 12:46.233
and is now seated
at the right hand
of the Father?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.868
JAKE & OTHERS:
I do.

12:47.901 --> 12:48.936
Do you believe
in the Holy Spirit,

12:48.969 --> 12:50.871
the holy Catholic Church,

12:50.904 --> 12:53.340
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,

12:53.373 --> 12:54.541
the resurrection
of the body,

12:54.574 --> 12:56.143
and the life everlasting?

12:56.176 --> 12:57.344
I do.
I do.

12:57.377 --> 13:01.882
( baby crying )

13:01.915 --> 13:03.851
SAM:
Out of my way, please.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.586
Nurse, five of morphine,
normal saline, liter bolus.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.889
What's open?
Did you just
call me "Nurse"?

13:08.922 --> 13:10.523
Let's check for an H and H
and move him to Trauma Two.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.225
Gross deformity
of the right ankle.
Hey, Doc!

13:12.259 --> 13:14.127
I'm kind of busy, dude.
But I can't walk.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.863
Oh, he's smart.
That makes it an emergency.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.497
Uh, Haleh, I need
a wheelchair.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.066
Looks like we have
a non-ambulatory
"sickler" here.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.067
For Eugene?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.234
Says he can't walk.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.569
You're the doctor.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.071
Give me an IV, CBC,

13:24.104 --> 13:26.206
retic, one liter of saline
and two of MS, okay?

13:26.239 --> 13:27.240
Thanks, man.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.575
OLBES:
Coming through!

13:28.608 --> 13:29.910
( sobbing )
Ray, what
are you doing?

13:29.943 --> 13:31.211
We've got multiples
rolling in.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.613
What's her story?
Marilyn Bracken, 40,

13:33.646 --> 13:35.215
minor burns
and multiple lacs to the face

13:35.248 --> 13:37.050
I shouldn't have been there!
arms and belly.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.218
Was she altered
at the scene?

13:38.251 --> 13:39.219
Yeah, but no evidence
of head trauma.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.921
Smoke inhalation?

13:40.954 --> 13:42.155
Pulse ox 100%, can't do
any better than that.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.623
Lungs are clear.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.893
( sobbing ):
What the hell is wrong with me?

13:45.893 --> 13:47.995
Heart rate's up to 130.
It was so dumb!

13:48.028 --> 13:49.462
Pretty tachy,
internal hemorrhage?

13:49.496 --> 13:50.998
LEWIS:
No blood in Morrison's.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.199
Hang in there,
Marilyn.
Tension pneumo?

13:52.232 --> 13:53.400
No, good breath sounds.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.501
She's still
satting at 100.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.903
Cardiac contusion?

13:55.903 --> 13:57.137
No sign of

13:57.170 --> 13:58.605
any chest trauma,
EKG looks normal.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.140
I give up, what do we got?

14:00.173 --> 14:01.308
We don't know.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.976
Multifocal PVCs.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.477
( sobbing ):
I didn't mean it...
Perfect.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.546
100 of lidocaine,
100% non-rebreather.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.115
BP's down to 80/60.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.282
Not bleeding, lungs are up.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.283
No sign of
head trauma.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.418
No cardiac history.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.021
Respiratory rate's up to 40.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.989
No tamponade.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.657
Pressure's dropping.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.658
What are we gonna do?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.360
LEWIS:
We don't know.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.132
Ready with the etomidate
and sux.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.433
Could this be spinal shock?

14:26.466 --> 14:28.335
No, she's still moving
all extremities.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.270
Systolic's down to 65.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.072
Maybe she's
allergic to latex.
No, no, just...

14:32.105 --> 14:34.074
Okay, let's step back
and start over.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.242
Airway.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.476
Breathing.
Respiratory
rate's

14:36.509 --> 14:38.111
up to 60-- we need
to intubate her.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.147
( all talking at once )
Repeat CBC. What else?

14:40.180 --> 14:42.182
Wait, hold the meds.
That's venous blood?
Yeah.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.218
Chuny, did you
hit an artery?
No, no way.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.554
LEWIS:
No, it's cyanide toxicity.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.656
Retinal arteries and veins
are bright red.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.992
Open an antidote kit.
She ingested cyanide?

14:52.025 --> 14:53.961
It's released
when things like PVC,

14:53.961 --> 14:56.063
polyurethane foam,
and polyester wadding burn.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.965
Amyl nitrate pearls.
Got 'em.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.267
Usually cyanide toxicity
is fatal at the scene.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.502
10cc's of sodium nitrite,

15:02.535 --> 15:05.072
then 50cc's
of sodium thiosulfate.

15:05.105 --> 15:08.108
Okay, let's just
give it a minute for
the meds to kick in.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.978
Do I just keep bagging?
BP's 90/60.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.213
She's good.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.514
Cool catch.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.216
( sighs ):
Ah... Okay.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.986
Uh, let's keep her 100%
non-rebreather.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.354
Send off
for an RBC and...

15:21.388 --> 15:23.023
cyanide plasma level.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.358
Uh, excuse me.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.695
Thought you couldn't
walk, man.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.097
Had to pee.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.464
What else am I
supposed to do?

15:31.498 --> 15:33.566
Well, you could
stop playing me,
for one thing.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.003
Nah, man, it's different.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.038
I'm serious.
I need to be here.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.572
Uh-huh.
The IV helped.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.108
That's why my foot
feels better.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.442
Give me your arm.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.278
( gasps )
Okay, you got your fix.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.513
Now, go home.
Man, it's different.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.248
I'm serious.
I need to be here.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.483
I need to take care of patients
with real problems,

15:50.517 --> 15:53.253
so go home and take
your meds, okay?
I can't. I'm all out.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.222
All right.

15:55.255 --> 15:58.158
MS Contin, 20 pills.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.393
Go get your refill
from hematology, okay?

16:00.427 --> 16:01.628
It's just gonna be
bad, I know it.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.430
I am starting to lose
my patience, Eugene.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.166
Just let me stay
for one night,
please, one night.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.334
No.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.506
Nicely done.
Thank you very much.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.675
You have some cuts
on your chest, arms,
hands, some bruising.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.078
Remarkable,
considering
your fall.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.612
I jumped.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.048
Oh.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.052
Can you feel me
touching your leg here?

16:25.052 --> 16:27.054
You're not pressing hard, right?

16:27.087 --> 16:29.122
HALEH:
Pratt, Kovac wants to know
if you're almost done.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.357
We're getting slammed out here.

16:30.390 --> 16:33.093
Tell him we'll both
be right there.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.195
He's got lateral
lower-extremity numbness.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.696
Motor exam's
limited by
his pain.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.365
H-Hey, what are they saying?

16:38.398 --> 16:40.567
They're just discussing
possible diagnoses.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.635
Contusions, lacs
and all four limbs move.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.305
You're making this more
complicated than it needs to be.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.307
He also had some
partial saddle anesthesia.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.077
DTRs are intact.
No sensory level deficit.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.212
Motor and sensory loss
is usually incomplete

16:52.245 --> 16:54.281
with cauda equina syndrome.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.449
X ray's back.
Good. Maybe now
I'll get

16:56.483 --> 16:59.652
some respect around here.
Anthony, your roommates
aren't here, but that

16:59.686 --> 17:01.654
doesn't mean they're not
at a different hospital.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.456
When did you
see them last?

17:03.490 --> 17:04.457
C-spine's clear.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.492
And, oh,
look at that--

17:05.525 --> 17:07.260
bilateral calcaneal fractures.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.595
I made my way to the window,

17:08.627 --> 17:10.497
and I told them,
I was, like, "Follow my voice."

17:10.530 --> 17:12.098
Look at this,
compression fracture

17:12.132 --> 17:13.233
of L-1.
I saw flames.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.567
He broke his back.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.368
Doesn't mean there's
cord involvement.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.771
ANTHONY:
I felt 'em, you know?
I'll call CT.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.340
I didn't want to die, okay?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.742
WOMAN:
Need some help here.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.444
KOVAC:
Another one
from the fire?

17:24.477 --> 17:26.113
Yup. Megan Nesbitt,
home alone.

17:26.113 --> 17:29.116
Partial-thickness burns
to hands and forearms.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.183
Good radial pulses.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.418
How old are
you, Megan?

17:31.451 --> 17:32.585
12.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.387
Pretty young
to be home alone.

17:35.522 --> 17:36.689
One percent with that epi.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.690
Let's buffer
with bicarb.

17:37.724 --> 17:38.791
How are you feeling,
Marilyn?

17:38.825 --> 17:40.527
Where's-where's my purse?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.861
She still altered?
Is it here?
Is my purse here?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.430
All right,
you need to sit back.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.864
We're gonna numb
and suture these cuts, okay?

17:44.897 --> 17:46.499
Ow, ow.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.301
Ma'am, you remember
what happened to you?

17:48.335 --> 17:50.270
I was in the lobby,
I-I was leaving, and...

17:50.303 --> 17:51.604
What time is it?

17:51.638 --> 17:52.672
There was
an explosion?
12:45.

17:52.705 --> 17:53.673
On the
first floor?

17:53.706 --> 17:54.674
I have to go home.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.143
My husband travels.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.244
I should be there
when he gets home.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.278
All right,
just calm down, Marilyn.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.313
Ow! Ow!

18:00.347 --> 18:02.282
Your apartment building
was very badly damaged
during the fire.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.284
( panting ):
That's not where I live.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.585
MARILYN:
Oh.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.523
It's okay to cry, Megan.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.192
I know it hurts.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.827
First and second-degree,
nothing circumferential.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.164
Titrate two to four of MS.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.898
We'll debride
after that.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.201
So you were home
by yourself, huh?

18:21.234 --> 18:23.203
That must have
been pretty scary.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.304
I'm used to it.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.208
Okay, Megan,

18:28.241 --> 18:29.609
you have some bruising
on your belly,

18:29.642 --> 18:31.478
so I'm gonna look at it
with something called

18:31.511 --> 18:33.780
an ultrasound.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.248
Reached the parents yet?

18:35.282 --> 18:36.316
Jerry's calling them.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.418
They're at the mall with Logan.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.387
No blood in the abdomen,

18:40.420 --> 18:42.422
but we'll still need consent
for a CT.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.856
Yeah, Jerry's on it.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.560
Is that a problem?

18:49.296 --> 18:50.297
Nope.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.733
Ready?

18:53.766 --> 18:56.736
Mm-hmm.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.538
Jake, how's my
favorite cousin?

18:58.571 --> 19:00.207
Patrick, how are you?
Good.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.308
Hey, this is, uh, Abby.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.642
Abby, yes,
hello.
Hi.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.843
Care for
some whiskey?

19:03.876 --> 19:05.612
Uh, no, thank you.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.847
Look, dear, it's
Jake and Abby.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.350
Well, she's a tiny
little thing, isn't she?

19:10.383 --> 19:12.585
Allow me to present my aunt
and uncle, Eileen and...

19:12.619 --> 19:14.254
Call us Aunt Eileen
and Uncle Liam.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.223
Okay.
( laughs )

19:16.223 --> 19:18.858
So, are you
divorced or
never married?

19:18.891 --> 19:20.227
Uncle Liam, we're-we're...

19:20.227 --> 19:21.661
We're gonna go sit down.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.695
We'll catch up later, yeah?
All right.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.930
Nice to meet you.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.232
EILEEN:
Nice to
meet you.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.299
Oh, there's
a seat.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.300
Okay. Hi.
WOMAN:
Hi.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.335
WOMAN #2:
Hi.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.902
Did you get
the sodas?

19:29.936 --> 19:31.571
Oh, yeah, I put them down
when I shaking someone's hand.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.805
I'll-I'll...
I'll go get 'em.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.341
I'll go get 'em.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.309
Sit down. I'll
go get 'em.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.777
WOMAN:
Hi.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.279
ABBY:
Hey.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.280
Hi.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.448
Hi.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.815
I'm Grandma Mary.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.551
We're so glad you
could come today.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.852
Oh, thank you. Me, too.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.354
We've heard so much
about you.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.821
Good things, I hope.

19:48.855 --> 19:49.822
Oh, Jake goes on and on.

19:49.856 --> 19:50.823
( laughs )

19:50.857 --> 19:52.259
Abby this.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.593
Abby that.
You were
a nurse.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.428
Now you're a doctor.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.264
But he never mentioned
any children.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.833
I don't have any.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.536
I had Eamon here
when I was 35.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.972
Cousin Grace had
her first at 40.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.740
Don't worry, Abby.
You've got time.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.243
( laughs )

20:10.277 --> 20:11.911
I met him online.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.313
I'm almost done numbing.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.747
Well, I never
actually met him.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.316
Oh, God,
I hope he's okay.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.285
So you never...

20:18.318 --> 20:19.752
( laughs ):
Oh. I got lost.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.454
Found myself looking at one
of those floor maps.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.856
You know, "You are here."

20:23.890 --> 20:25.458
Okay, 30cc syringe
and a splash guard
to Dr. Lewis.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.559
4-0 nylons
and open ten pack.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.328
This is wrong.
Dropped
her BP.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.896
It's really, really wrong.
CARTER:
80 systolic.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.698
Check her lungs.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.900
She had equal breath sounds
and no evidence of chest trauma.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.868
Blast wave from an explosion
can still collapse a lung.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.737
Okay, let's up the
dopamine to 20 mikes.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.738
Dr. Lewis, Dr. Weaver.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.039
LEWIS:
Oh, great.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.508
Now she's
calling me?
Can you

20:41.541 --> 20:42.509
tell me where
it's hurting you?

20:42.542 --> 20:44.010
My stomach.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.545
LEWIS:
Repeat the hemocue.
Why didn't you get me?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.380
She just wants you
in her office at 7:00.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.381
Okay. Uh, let's get
a repeat chest.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.382
Why so late?

20:49.416 --> 20:50.683
No life.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.285
MARQUEZ:
Repeat
hemocue 13.4.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.553
Okay, so no blood loss.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.987
MARQUEZ:
Temp's 101.

20:55.021 --> 20:55.988
CARTER:
She could
be septic

20:56.022 --> 20:57.457
from the belly.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.691
She's got some
guarding on
the right.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.727
No. We need to look
for another source.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.894
The blast could've
put a piece of glass

21:01.928 --> 21:03.330
right into
her intestine.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.331
There's nothing on X ray.

21:04.331 --> 21:05.465
These are all superficial.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.634
Can I get, uh, 3.375
of Zosyn, please?

21:07.667 --> 21:09.336
I've irrigated all the lacs.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.603
Do you want me to probe all 30
of them to prove it?

21:10.637 --> 21:11.638
Yeah.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.540
Okay, this one's superficial.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.376
I'm telling you, there's nothing
deeper than the subq.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.377
( groans )

21:17.410 --> 21:18.378
Ow.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.012
What happened?

21:20.046 --> 21:22.349
Something cut me.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.851
Your parents are
on their way in.

21:24.884 --> 21:28.755
Did-Did you tell them
I almost died?

21:28.788 --> 21:32.359
No.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.427
C-Could you?

21:36.429 --> 21:39.766
Megan, is everything okay
with you and your folks?

21:39.799 --> 21:42.034
I guess.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.636
How about your little brother?

21:43.670 --> 21:44.804
Half.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.775
My mom got married again.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.876
Could you at least

21:49.909 --> 21:51.711
tell them I got hurt,

21:51.744 --> 21:54.847
like, really, really bad?

21:54.881 --> 21:57.617
JERRY:
Sam...

21:57.650 --> 21:59.619
those guys you wanted
me to check on,

21:59.652 --> 22:01.888
uh, the jumper's friends?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.592
Thank you, Jerry.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.397
You are all done.

22:10.397 --> 22:13.032
Why don't you get some rest,
and I'll be back soon, okay?

22:23.643 --> 22:25.144
I think we should get
Social Services involved

22:25.177 --> 22:26.913
with Megan.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.147
Family here yet?

22:28.180 --> 22:29.916
No, but she is
in a weird space.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.951
Well, she just went
through a traumatic event.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.119
Might be problems
at home.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.521
Is that what she told you?

22:34.554 --> 22:35.922
No, but her parents left her
all alone

22:35.955 --> 22:37.490
while they went shopping.

22:37.524 --> 22:38.658
Well, we've done
the same with Alex.

22:38.691 --> 22:39.792
I just think that she's...

22:39.826 --> 22:41.528
Sam, the girl
was in a fire.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.062
Give the family
the chance to
deal with that

22:43.095 --> 22:45.532
before pushing a
social worker on them.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.904
Two sets of cultures
prior to antibiotics,

22:51.938 --> 22:53.172
and start another line
of saline,

22:53.205 --> 22:55.107
titrate the dopamine
to a MAP of 90.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.477
Free air. Glass shard
punctured her colon.

22:57.510 --> 22:58.878
Why didn't it show
up on the X ray?

22:58.911 --> 23:00.146
Must have been unleaded glass.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.114
Only heavy metals
show up on X ray.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.851
Dr. Carter, your father's
returning your call on line two.

23:04.884 --> 23:05.952
Oh. Excuse me.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.587
Oh, by the way,
congratulations.

23:07.620 --> 23:08.921
I heard you got
early tenure.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.457
Yeah. Thanks.

23:10.457 --> 23:11.691
Dr. Lewis,
how's the finger?

23:11.724 --> 23:13.526
Oh, sore.
So is my arm.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.161
MARQUEZ:
Tetanus hurts.
What can I say?

23:15.194 --> 23:17.063
Rapid HIV test
on Mrs. Bracken
came back negative.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.465
Thank God for that.

23:18.498 --> 23:19.832
I hope this means
in the future,

23:19.866 --> 23:21.801
you'll leave any deep
probing to the surgeons?

23:21.834 --> 23:23.870
Call the OR. Tell them
we're on the way up.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.772
Did Dr. Weaver make
the surgical tenure
announcements?

23:25.805 --> 23:26.839
Yeah, first thing
this morning. Why?

23:26.873 --> 23:28.207
I was just wondering

23:28.240 --> 23:29.709
when she was gonna work
her way down here.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.010
Well, I hope the ER
fares better than Surgery.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.679
We only got one slot.
Oh.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.714
I'm sure it will, though.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.082
Dr. Lewis?
Yeah.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.717
Uh, could you order
a Social Services consult

23:37.750 --> 23:39.018
on Megan Nesbitt?

23:39.051 --> 23:40.520
Uh, Kovac's patient?

23:40.553 --> 23:42.154
Yeah.

23:42.188 --> 23:45.492
Uh... we just disagree
on how to handle it.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.494
Oh, you guys
fighting?

23:47.527 --> 23:48.595
Lack of money,
sex, communication?

23:48.628 --> 23:50.530
The last one.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.098
Yeah, there's a
lot of that going
around here today.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.633
Where is he?
Who?

23:53.666 --> 23:54.801
Luka.

23:54.834 --> 23:55.835
No. What are you doing?

23:55.868 --> 23:57.504
My job.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.105
Come here.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.542
( sighs )

24:04.176 --> 24:06.212
Sam thinks that
Megan Nesbitt

24:06.245 --> 24:07.914
needs a Social
Services consult.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.216
You went over my head?

24:10.249 --> 24:11.984
You totally
blew me off.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.957
Okay, despite working
here 12 hours a day,

24:17.990 --> 24:19.125
this isn't your home.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.960
This is a workplace.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.529
It's an emergency room--
my emergency room.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.730
So, if you're having trouble,

24:23.763 --> 24:25.565
you should see
a couples therapist,

24:25.598 --> 24:26.766
and if you can't do that,
you should work separate shifts.

24:26.799 --> 24:27.767
Does that make sense?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.035
Yep.
Yep.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.269
And as far as
a consult goes, uh...

24:30.302 --> 24:31.871
just call them
because the parents

24:31.904 --> 24:33.840
will probably get here
before they do anyway.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.812
RASGOTRA:
I took the clavicle fracture

24:39.846 --> 24:41.013
out of a
figure-of-eight

24:41.047 --> 24:42.281
and put him in
a sling and swath.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.616
All your fault,
by the way.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.785
What?
Morris as
chief resident.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.554
If you'd taken the
job, we wouldn't be
living this nightmare.

24:47.554 --> 24:48.888
His first day
and already a mutiny.

24:48.921 --> 24:49.989
Personally,
I'm ready to keelhaul him.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.691
CARTER:
I'll try back.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.893
MRSA abscess.
Allergic to sulfa.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.595
Um, clindamycin.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.597
Two words: voice mail.

24:57.630 --> 24:58.765
( exaggerated laugh )

24:58.798 --> 25:00.199
What's all that?

25:00.232 --> 25:02.068
Friends of mine bugging me
to go out with them tonight

25:02.101 --> 25:04.303
and party after
a long 12-hour shift.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.905
That's the problem
with the non-medical types:

25:05.938 --> 25:07.607
they don't get it.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.808
BARNETT:
Dodged the admission
of Eugene Bradley

25:08.841 --> 25:10.242
in complaining
of foot pain...

25:10.276 --> 25:12.645
Par-tay at Ike's tonight--
bossman is buying--

25:12.679 --> 25:14.246
but don't get used to it.
Who's on board?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.082
Half the time the medical
types don't get it.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.149
Ray?

25:17.183 --> 25:18.150
Other plans.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.151
Neela?

25:19.185 --> 25:20.687
The Apprentice is on.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.188
Pratt?

25:22.221 --> 25:23.956
I'm busy.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.024
Dr. Carter?

25:25.057 --> 25:26.325
Hmm?

25:26.358 --> 25:27.960
Oh, um...

25:27.994 --> 25:31.831
ALL:
* Happy Tenure to you

25:31.864 --> 25:33.966
* Happy Tenure to you...

25:34.000 --> 25:35.602
Don't I get a cake?

25:35.635 --> 25:39.772
ALL:
* Happy Tenure, Dr. Carter

25:39.806 --> 25:44.043
* Happy Tenure to you.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.646
( cheering and laughter )

25:46.679 --> 25:48.615
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.986
( all cheering and whooping )

25:54.020 --> 25:56.789
Excuse me. They said
my wife was in a fire?

26:00.059 --> 26:01.794
It's just down here.

26:01.828 --> 26:04.263
She responded very well
to the cyanide antidote.

26:04.296 --> 26:06.265
Both her blood pressure
and her pulse normalized.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.967
Good, good.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.936
A piece of glass shrapnel
from the blast, however,

26:09.969 --> 26:11.638
may have perforated
her bowel.

26:11.671 --> 26:14.073
She's gonna need surgery,
maybe a colostomy.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.341
Oh, God...

26:15.374 --> 26:16.843
Which hopefully
will be temporary.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.945
I don't understand.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.013
I'm sorry?
How this happened.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.683
From what I was told, there was
an explosion, followed by...

26:23.716 --> 26:24.851
You...
We're just
going over here.

26:24.884 --> 26:25.852
...followed by a fire.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.219
We live in Tinley Park.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.956
Wh-Why was she at some
apartment in the city?

26:29.989 --> 26:31.791
I don't know.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.760
She told me
she had a dance class.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.695
I'll tell you what, why don't
you have a seat right here.

26:35.728 --> 26:36.829
I know she's alone a lot.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.831
My... job...

26:38.865 --> 26:40.166
We fight about it.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.668
Yeah...

26:41.701 --> 26:42.902
Listen, let me
go see if I can...

26:42.935 --> 26:44.403
Can I talk to her?

26:44.436 --> 26:46.773
Um... you probably
wouldn't be able to...

26:46.806 --> 26:48.841
Well, then, can you
tell her something?

26:50.076 --> 26:51.343
Yep.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.881
Tell her...

26:57.684 --> 26:58.918
that I'm here.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.789
Okay.

27:17.136 --> 27:21.708
Susan, how long have you
been standing there?

27:21.708 --> 27:23.209
Not long.

27:23.242 --> 27:24.376
Sorry I'm early.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.112
I know you wanted
to talk to me later.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.015
Oh, sit down.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.883
Guess there's no point
in rushing to tell me

27:30.917 --> 27:32.752
I didn't get tenure.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.821
I'm sorry, I've just
been incredibly busy.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.189
Mm.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.859
You want to at least tell me
why I didn't get it?

27:39.892 --> 27:42.128
There were a number of factors:

27:42.161 --> 27:43.863
significant budget cuts,

27:43.896 --> 27:46.933
your lack of
published materials...

27:46.966 --> 27:48.935
The criteria are complicated.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.770
How about
I simplify it for you?

27:50.803 --> 27:52.004
I've been
an attending
for seven years--

27:52.038 --> 27:53.339
that's two more
than Carter--

27:53.372 --> 27:54.907
I've been an
outstanding doctor,

27:54.941 --> 27:57.076
a dedicated teacher
and a committed chief.

27:57.109 --> 28:00.246
No one's refuting your abilities
as a clinician or teacher

28:00.279 --> 28:01.447
and, yes, you do
an excellent job

28:01.480 --> 28:02.882
running the department...

28:02.915 --> 28:04.183
Which is where
you want me to stay

28:04.216 --> 28:06.085
until, of course,
you can replace me.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.319
I don't follow.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.955
The ER runs smoothly.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.757
That's one less thing
for you to worry about.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.092
That's ridiculous.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.327
Because if I was tenured,

28:15.361 --> 28:17.764
I might work less shifts
in favor of doing research,

28:17.764 --> 28:19.498
and you might actually
have to give a damn

28:19.531 --> 28:21.233
about the first floor
of this hospital.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.435
Did you honestly think
your interest

28:23.469 --> 28:26.272
in an academic track
would be taken seriously?

28:26.305 --> 28:27.807
What?

28:27.840 --> 28:29.208
That you could wait

28:29.241 --> 28:31.043
until your seventh year
as an attending

28:31.077 --> 28:33.212
to start aggressively
pursuing grants?

28:33.245 --> 28:34.513
I've brought in some grants.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.148
$75,000!

28:36.182 --> 28:38.084
By now you should've hit
at least a million.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.418
The university

28:39.451 --> 28:41.420
depends on grants
to cover your salary.

28:41.453 --> 28:44.791
That's not only unacceptable
for a physician seeking tenure,

28:44.824 --> 28:45.825
that's embarrassing.

28:47.526 --> 28:50.930
So forget excellence,
forget performance...

28:50.963 --> 28:52.865
just write a check
to build a new wing.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.369
This hospital is in the business
of staying open.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.371
We have to make our
choices accordingly.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.007
Mm.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.247
Finger dislocation's at X-ray,

29:08.280 --> 29:10.516
and shrimp allergy needs
a recheck after subq epi.

29:10.549 --> 29:12.018
So why tell me?

29:12.051 --> 29:13.452
Well, because if I
don't leave now,

29:13.485 --> 29:15.054
my band can't make
its Evanston gig.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.989
And that's my problem
how, exactly?

29:17.023 --> 29:19.525
Neela, I dispo'd ten
patients in the last hour.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.527
You get to pop a finger
back in place. Please?

29:21.560 --> 29:23.329
Fine, but you're cleaning
the bathroom this week.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.530
All right, deal.

29:24.563 --> 29:27.566
With actual cleaning products.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.069
MARQUEZ:
Banker's hours,
huh, Ray?

29:30.102 --> 29:33.139
I'm like an ATM, babe.
Do business 24/7!

29:33.172 --> 29:34.473
Hey, yo, yo!

29:34.506 --> 29:36.308
Taxi!

29:36.342 --> 29:38.477
Hey! Ah, hey, taxi!

29:38.510 --> 29:40.279
Damn it.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.286
Eugene?

29:49.555 --> 29:53.492
Wh-Wh... What are you doing?

29:56.963 --> 29:59.431
Okay, you need El fare?

29:59.465 --> 30:01.100
Here we go.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.873
Well, it's getting
pretty late.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.440
Mom's gonna worry.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.476
She's still at work.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.080
Eugene, you need
to go home now.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.982
We are not going
to admit you.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.249
They're not going to
give you any more drugs.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.919
You need to go home now.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.353
Man, I ain't going back.

30:21.387 --> 30:22.855
I can't.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.259
Why not?

30:29.428 --> 30:31.630
He'd be there.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.265
Who?

30:33.299 --> 30:35.401
Her boyfriend.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.036
Your mom's?

30:38.604 --> 30:40.639
Okay.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.441
So, the two of you
don't get along?

30:44.310 --> 30:46.078
He just does stuff.

30:52.118 --> 30:53.986
Stuff like what?

31:06.065 --> 31:08.367
I just need to get
some Dilantin.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.471
Where is...

31:12.504 --> 31:15.607
Whoa, did somebody
alphabetize these?

31:15.641 --> 31:17.043
Yeah, believe it or not.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.047
Why don't you just say it?

31:21.080 --> 31:22.048
Say what?

31:22.081 --> 31:23.049
You're mad.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.951
I'm not.

31:24.951 --> 31:27.987
Right. Didn't bother you one bit
that I went over your head?

31:28.020 --> 31:29.956
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.090
What?

31:31.123 --> 31:32.591
You won't tell me how you feel.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.126
Because it's fine.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.627
It's not fine, Luka.
If it were fine,

31:35.661 --> 31:37.563
you wouldn't have
avoided touching me

31:37.596 --> 31:39.498
when I squeezed
past you just now.
What?

31:39.531 --> 31:41.133
You... you bury
your feelings.

31:41.167 --> 31:42.234
You pretend that
they're not there,

31:42.268 --> 31:43.369
or that you don't have them.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.603
I have feelings,
but I don't need

31:44.636 --> 31:46.172
to share them
every five seconds.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.107
And I don't need
to share them here, okay?

31:48.140 --> 31:52.211
Sorry to interrupt, but Megan
says she's in a lot of pain.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.513
Uh, give her
another four of morphine.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.188
Fine.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.459
Just try four of Zofran.

32:09.461 --> 32:10.596
How's your cake?

32:10.629 --> 32:12.564
It's good.
It's unexpected.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.200
They should've waited.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.402
They could've had
a cake for both of us.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.403
Snack cake?

32:17.436 --> 32:19.005
No, thank you.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.341
What's wrong?

32:22.374 --> 32:25.044
I didn't get tenure.

32:25.077 --> 32:27.346
What?

32:27.379 --> 32:29.648
Wait. Susan, who
got the slots if
you didn't get it?

32:29.681 --> 32:32.218
Slot. Singular.
That'd be you.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.020
I am so sorry.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.322
Yeah, they gave me the usual
drivel about budget cuts and...

32:36.355 --> 32:37.689
No, no, no, no.
They've always had

32:37.723 --> 32:39.291
more than one
tenure slot.

32:39.325 --> 32:43.229
Well, till now. Too bad
it was the year you applied.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.364
What do you
mean by that?

32:45.397 --> 32:47.233
Just... nothing.
No, what do you
mean by that?

32:47.266 --> 32:48.600
You saying I
didn't earn it?
That my funding

32:48.634 --> 32:50.202
of the outpatient
clinic got me tenure?

32:50.236 --> 32:52.071
No, don't, don't
put words in my mouth.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.339
I have worked my ass off here
for 11 years, you know.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.207
Yes, yes...
I've brought in grants,

32:55.241 --> 32:56.242
I've published,
I taught...
Yes, I know you have.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.210
I never asked for this.

32:58.244 --> 33:00.246
You never wanted it, Carter.

33:00.279 --> 33:01.380
You never did.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.249
This is my home.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.684
This is where I started.

33:05.717 --> 33:08.187
This is where I want to stay.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.089
And I get the feeling
that half the time,

33:10.122 --> 33:13.292
you would rather
be anywhere but here.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.098
Yeah, I thought so.

33:24.703 --> 33:25.504
Iron chef in three needs
a non-occlusive dressing,

33:25.537 --> 33:26.638
then he can go.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.107
How about you?

33:28.140 --> 33:29.141
You gonna go?

33:29.175 --> 33:30.142
You don't give up,
do you?

33:30.176 --> 33:31.610
Car's outside.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.279
Give me trouble, you're
riding in the trunk.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.181
All right,
give me two minutes.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.516
Don't try sneaking out the back.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.151
Jerry, what's open?

33:39.185 --> 33:40.252
Thought you'd
be covering

33:40.286 --> 33:41.420
"Smells Like
Teen Spirit" by now.

33:41.453 --> 33:42.821
Anything in exam two?

33:42.854 --> 33:44.656
We got one free bed.
What are you doing?

33:44.690 --> 33:46.192
Admitting him.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.559
I can see that.

33:47.593 --> 33:48.560
The question
is, why?

33:48.594 --> 33:50.162
Chuny.
Yeah?

33:50.196 --> 33:51.430
Can you get Eugene
here settled in?

33:51.463 --> 33:52.431
Oh, sure.

33:52.464 --> 33:53.665
You want to come with me?

33:56.368 --> 33:58.237
He was raped.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.243
This will make you
feel better.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.146
I know her.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.580
She lives in my building.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.382
Her burns are minor.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.717
She going to be
okay, like you.

34:14.453 --> 34:18.324
She used to bring food
to the guy next door.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.626
He was weird.

34:20.659 --> 34:23.195
Had all this stuff
stacked up.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.734
He's probably dead, isn't he?

34:28.766 --> 34:31.503
Your neighbor?

34:31.536 --> 34:32.571
I don't know.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.409
I was the one
who called 911.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.312
Smart girl.

34:42.481 --> 34:46.518
They didn't come as quick
as I thought they would.

34:46.552 --> 34:50.156
I thought if I called them
before I did it...

34:52.524 --> 34:54.826
I tried to put it out,

34:54.860 --> 34:56.828
but it got too big...

34:56.862 --> 34:59.498
( baby crying )

34:59.531 --> 35:00.766
Honey, are you okay?

35:00.799 --> 35:02.901
Mommy... Mommy...

35:02.934 --> 35:04.403
It's okay. It's okay.
( baby crying )

35:04.436 --> 35:05.704
Shh...!

35:05.737 --> 35:07.506
It's okay.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.775
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.178
( baby crying )

35:12.178 --> 35:14.480
Now how do you get an Irishman
up on the roof, huh?

35:14.513 --> 35:17.216
You tell him the drinks
are on the house.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.850
( laughing )

35:18.884 --> 35:20.786
There's a man from Kerry

35:20.819 --> 35:22.754
comes into the bar with
a pig under his arm.

35:22.788 --> 35:23.822
The bartender says...

35:23.855 --> 35:24.856
Whoo.
Here you go.

35:24.890 --> 35:25.857
Thanks, lady.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.459
Hey.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.228
Hey.

35:29.261 --> 35:30.862
Her name's Abby.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.631
Sorry, Uncle Jake.

35:32.664 --> 35:33.732
All right,
get out of here.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.401
Get out of here.

35:36.902 --> 35:38.337
They're cute.

35:39.505 --> 35:40.572
A little loud.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.241
You have to be.

35:42.274 --> 35:44.410
You got to raise your
voice in a clan this big.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.347
How am I doing?

35:48.380 --> 35:49.781
Let's see, uh...

35:49.815 --> 35:51.750
with 99 percent
of the votes in,

35:51.783 --> 35:57.289
( laughter )
it appears that
you are a keeper.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.524
Who's the holdout?

35:58.557 --> 36:01.227
Aunt Cecilia.

36:01.227 --> 36:02.494
I think you lost points

36:02.528 --> 36:03.929
when you told her
you weren't sure

36:03.962 --> 36:05.464
if there's a heaven
or a hell.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.466
Well, I'm not.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.468
Doesn't bother me...

36:09.501 --> 36:11.370
I'm a pick-and-choose
Catholic myself.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.539
Doesn't work that way.
Yeah, it does.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.907
"Honor thy father and mother."

36:15.941 --> 36:18.377
"Thou shall not kill."
A given.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.512
"No premarital sex."
"No birth control."

36:20.546 --> 36:21.847
Not so much.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.817
Hey.
( chuckles )

36:25.851 --> 36:27.953
( laughs )

36:27.986 --> 36:30.356
Pretty overwhelming, huh?

36:30.389 --> 36:32.358
But in a good way.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.525
( laughter )

36:35.927 --> 36:37.329
Do you want to hear something
kind of stupid?

36:37.363 --> 36:39.265
I'd love to.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.802
I never imagined
there were families...

36:43.835 --> 36:46.905
like this.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.508
You're really lucky.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.977
( laughter )
Yeah.

36:52.010 --> 36:54.380
Having said that...

36:54.413 --> 36:55.581
Yes?

36:55.614 --> 36:59.985
I'm really, really
ready to go home.

37:00.018 --> 37:02.321
Okay.
Okay.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.023
WOMAN:
There you are.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.326
And to think I
was gonna leave

37:07.359 --> 37:08.860
'cause there wasn't
any real men here.
What's up, baby?

37:08.894 --> 37:10.462
Mm...
Give me some sugar.

37:10.496 --> 37:11.863
Nice to see you.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.866
'Bout damn time
you got your fine self here.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.303
How you doin'?
Where you been anyway?

37:17.336 --> 37:18.570
You know,
just working out,

37:18.604 --> 37:19.571
all around,
I ain't goin' nowhere.

37:19.605 --> 37:20.906
Mmm.
Uh, keep moving.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.008
Sorry, ladies,
he'll be right back.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.844
Yeah.

37:25.877 --> 37:27.012
( Pratt talks quietly )

37:27.045 --> 37:29.014
( laughs ):
Yeah, yeah.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.682
Look who's here.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.684
Oh!
Oh!

37:32.718 --> 37:34.553
( laughing )

37:34.586 --> 37:35.887
Holla at your boy.
Oh, man.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.856
Happy birthday.
Now shut up.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.958
( all talking )

37:39.991 --> 37:42.394
What's up, baby?
What's up?

37:42.428 --> 37:44.029
What's up?

37:44.062 --> 37:45.364
What are you
talking about?

37:45.397 --> 37:46.898
Where the chicks at?

37:46.932 --> 37:48.400
I see you standing
here by yourselves.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.668
Where the chicks at?

37:49.701 --> 37:51.903
Just get Mrs. Grayber
started on Compazine.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.539
Yeah.
Haleh?

37:53.572 --> 37:55.407
Need an ankle series
on Joanna McVay in Three.

37:55.441 --> 37:56.742
Sure thing.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.644
Just let me know
how she's doing, okay?

38:00.479 --> 38:01.880
What's Eugene
still doing here?

38:01.913 --> 38:05.584
Dr. Barnett admitted him.

38:05.617 --> 38:06.918
Ray, your band's on two.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.053
They're backstage,
and you're late.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.421
Tell 'em
I'll be right there.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.922
Yes, no,
I realize that but...
Ray.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.791
No, no...
Uh, hold on. Yeah?

38:12.824 --> 38:14.493
Yes?

38:14.526 --> 38:16.628
You dispo patients faster
than a speeding bullet,

38:16.662 --> 38:17.796
and not in a good way.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.097
And now that we're slammed,

38:19.130 --> 38:20.932
you dump a known drug-
seeker on the next shift

38:20.966 --> 38:22.701
so you can get to
your next gig on time.

38:22.734 --> 38:23.969
I tried to warn him.

38:24.002 --> 38:25.604
It's a bit
more complicated than that.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.805
You know what? You
want to be a rock star,

38:26.838 --> 38:28.039
that's cool, go for
it.o

38:28.073 --> 38:29.608
But play weddings
and bar mitzvahs

38:29.641 --> 38:30.776
to make ends meet.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.444
Because medicine
is not a hobby,

38:32.478 --> 38:34.045
or another way to pay the bills,

38:34.079 --> 38:36.515
or Plan B in case you don't
sell a million records.

38:36.548 --> 38:39.084
It's what you want to do,
or not.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.923
She didn't mean
for the fire to get so big.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.792
She just wanted
the firemen to come.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.027
Pretty desperate for
her parents' attention.

38:49.060 --> 38:52.398
I think she just
felt shut out, you know?

38:52.398 --> 38:54.633
Now she needs to live
with even more pain--

38:54.666 --> 38:57.636
three people dead,
more wounded.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.571
Social worker
said she's going to juvey.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.707
12 years old.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.141
Sad.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.777
Yeah.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.954
Why is it that we can talk
about anything other than us?

39:19.758 --> 39:21.126
I don't know.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.903
I think Lewis is right.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.939
I think we need help.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.017
Mm.
Good?

39:46.051 --> 39:47.519
No, man. I'm good.

39:47.553 --> 39:48.887
Hey, man,
thought you had the job

39:48.920 --> 39:50.522
at the print shop, man.
What happened?

39:50.556 --> 39:51.690
Downsized, man.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.024
Gotta get a new job soon.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.526
Teesha says
I get in her way being home,

39:54.560 --> 39:56.528
mess up her routine.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.864
I know--
be a doctor.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.532
( all laughing )

40:00.566 --> 40:02.000
Yeah, if Greg's one,
how hard can it be?

40:02.033 --> 40:03.469
Right? Right?
Right, right, right, right.

40:03.502 --> 40:04.670
Man, what time is it?

40:04.703 --> 40:06.004
Man, I gotta get up
in the morning.

40:06.037 --> 40:08.106
Hey, yo,
check this out.

40:08.139 --> 40:10.041
Look at that.
Yo!
Yo, man, what you doin', man?

40:10.075 --> 40:11.176
Put that away, man.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.611
Oh, man, come on, man.

40:12.644 --> 40:13.812
What?
That loaded?

40:13.845 --> 40:15.581
Hell, yeah,
it's loaded.

40:15.614 --> 40:16.848
Stop playin', man.
Don't be wavin' it around.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.550
Let's get back to the party,
man.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.718
What you doin'?

40:19.751 --> 40:20.819
This the real party right here.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.488
Remember back in the day

40:22.521 --> 40:23.822
when we shot all those
lights out on the bridge?

40:23.855 --> 40:25.190
Yeah, I remember that.
That was a long time ago.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.558
( gunshot )
Oh!

40:26.592 --> 40:28.193
What are you doin', man?
Chill!

40:28.226 --> 40:29.895
I think this fires
a little bit crooked.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.563
I think that's
the problem.

40:31.597 --> 40:32.864
Nah, you're drunk, man.
That's the problem.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.132
( gunshot )
Oh, come on, man.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.200
I'm 30, man.
The last thing I need...

40:35.233 --> 40:36.702
Put that away, man.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.236
Do you want to
get arrested?
Put that away.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.471
Oh!

40:39.505 --> 40:40.839
Man, chill!
That's nice.

40:40.872 --> 40:43.141
Y'all just jealous.
No, man, you stupid, man.

40:43.174 --> 40:44.910
Stupid.
Come on. Let's haul ass.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.044
Let's haul ass, man.

40:46.077 --> 40:49.447
( talking indistinctly )

41:04.930 --> 41:07.198
How you doing?

41:10.769 --> 41:14.673
Listen, I... ( sighs )

41:14.706 --> 41:16.675
I really wish
you'd told me.

41:21.046 --> 41:23.682
Or, uh...

41:23.715 --> 41:26.552
that I'd asked.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.125
You tired?

41:34.159 --> 41:38.129
No.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.599
Okay.

41:42.668 --> 41:45.671
Why don't I stay here

41:45.704 --> 41:48.774
till your mom gets here?

41:50.676 --> 41:53.612
You a musician?

41:57.148 --> 41:59.785
Not tonight, man.

42:23.909 --> 42:26.645
Oh, yeah.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.283
You know what, babe?

42:32.317 --> 42:34.019
Weaver and the tenure board

42:34.052 --> 42:36.221
can kiss my big, white,

42:36.254 --> 42:37.856
semi-hairy ass.

42:37.889 --> 42:40.992
( laughs )

42:41.026 --> 42:43.194
I shouldn't have
got my hopes up.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.863
Our hopes up.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.832
It's okay.
We're going to be fine.

42:46.865 --> 42:48.700
I just had all
the money spent--

42:48.734 --> 42:49.868
buy a house,

42:49.901 --> 42:51.336
start a college fund
for Cosmo,

42:51.369 --> 42:52.871
take a damn vacation.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.040
Baby, we'll figure it out.

42:55.073 --> 42:58.109
( sighs )

42:58.143 --> 43:00.211
You know what's funny?

43:00.245 --> 43:03.181
I really wanted this.

43:03.214 --> 43:04.750
I know.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.885
I know you did.

43:06.918 --> 43:09.220
I know.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.990
( sighs )

43:12.023 --> 43:13.191
Hello?

43:13.224 --> 43:16.261
Kem?

43:16.294 --> 43:20.065
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.968
Oh, not much.

43:23.001 --> 43:27.005
I got awarded tenure today.

43:27.038 --> 43:30.075
Thank you. Thank you.

43:30.108 --> 43:31.910
No, no, it is.
It's very nice.

43:31.943 --> 43:35.146
It's very nice.

43:35.180 --> 43:40.218
We will. We will have
to celebrate it sometime.

43:40.251 --> 43:42.754
Really?

43:42.788 --> 43:44.923
( chuckles )

43:44.956 --> 43:47.092
You serious?

43:47.125 --> 43:49.227
How's the clinic?

43:49.260 --> 43:51.229
( laughs )

43:51.262 --> 43:55.701
Oh. Oh, they
must've loved that.

43:55.701 --> 43:57.869
I miss you, too. Yeah.
