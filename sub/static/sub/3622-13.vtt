Rufus, you can't keep
breaking character like that.

Ah! Going to have
to recast you, buddy.

You just don't have

01:32.059 --> 01:34.193
I'm trying to redefine

( <i>phone beeping</i> )

01:36.864 --> 01:38.630
Kim, I've got a lead
on Drakken.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.199
He ordered a shrink ray
on-line

01:40.201 --> 01:42.101
and had it delivered
to an address

01:42.103 --> 01:43.669
in the Mojave Desert.

get around to a shrink ray.

01:50.044 --> 01:52.044
Once I've shrunk
to microscopic size,

01:52.046 --> 01:53.979
I will be able to infiltrate

the most secretive

to put the finishing touches
on his shrink ray?

02:16.370 --> 02:17.736
He needs to go out.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.705
He was just out
ten minutes ago.

Now what did we agree on?

02:20.975 --> 02:22.908
( <i>sighs</i> )

02:22.910 --> 02:25.043
If I wanted a dog, I had to

No, seriously,

with the banter

to the kung-fu fighting.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.570
I call cheatsies.

10:05.572 --> 10:06.805
Nice move, Rufus!

10:06.807 --> 10:08.573
Yeah.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.141
( <i>snarling, grunting</i> )

10:10.143 --> 10:12.444
( <i>grunting</i> )

10:16.816 --> 10:18.416
( <i>both growling</i> )

10:22.855 --> 10:24.255
( <i>whooping</i> ):
Yeah!

10:24.257 --> 10:25.890
There's that monster instinct

10:25.892 --> 10:27.692
I was looking for Rufus!

10:29.495 --> 10:31.630
( <i>Drakken whistles casually</i> )

10:31.632 --> 10:33.531
( <i>whistling continues</i>)

10:35.901 --> 10:37.469
( <i>grunts, groans</i> )

10:37.471 --> 10:38.203
( <i>moans</i> )

10:39.805 --> 10:41.906
( <i>dog whimpering</i> )

10:44.176 --> 10:46.177
( <i>grunts</i> ):
Get off!

10:46.179 --> 10:47.412
( <i>men whooping</i>)

10:47.414 --> 10:48.813
Good job, boys.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.882
( <i>men whooping</i>)

10:51.917 --> 10:53.885
Mine! It's all mine!

10:53.887 --> 10:55.387
It...!

10:55.389 --> 10:57.288
( <i>bubbling sounds</i>)

10:57.290 --> 10:59.491
Oh, I'm... sorry, is this yours?

10:59.493 --> 11:01.826
I was... just borrowing it,
you know?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.261
Really...

11:03.263 --> 11:06.464
( <i>Drakken yelling</i> )

11:06.466 --> 11:08.600
( <i>horns honking</i> )

11:09.535 --> 11:10.835
RON:
This is it.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.772
The redefining of the
monster movie genre.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.807
I hear laughter...
is that a good sign?

11:16.842 --> 11:17.842
Agent Smith.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.310
And Agent Smith.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.345
What are you guys doing here?

11:20.347 --> 11:21.446
National Security.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.747
We couldn't allow the public

11:22.749 --> 11:24.282
to see the Area 51 footage.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.284
So we switched it
with one of your home movies.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.285
Home movies?

11:27.287 --> 11:28.386
Which one?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.221
I make a potty.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.257
( <i>laughter</i> )

11:32.259 --> 11:33.558
<i>Ron's Big Day?</i>

11:33.560 --> 11:35.527
<i>Ron's Big Day.</i>
