WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:02.252
Previously on 90210:

00:02.377 --> 00:04.588
We have a son together.

00:04.713 --> 00:06.214
I want to hire a private
investigator to find him.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.090
What did you say to Ryan?

00:08.216 --> 00:09.510
About what?
About me.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.345
Not much.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.888
You shouldn't
have said anything.

00:13.012 --> 00:16.642
I'm heading in your direction
if you want a ride.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.769
How do you know
where I'm heading?

00:18.894 --> 00:20.562
I don't.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.689
OZZIE:
I don't like games.

00:21.814 --> 00:23.565
And I don't like people
who play games.

00:24.775 --> 00:25.651
ANNIE:
Oh, my God, Jason.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.277
Listen to me.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.570
Everything
you have done

00:28.696 --> 00:30.364
was just to set me up
to ruin my birthday?

00:30.489 --> 00:31.365
Absolutely.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.200
Being your friend?
I'm over it.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.494
I already beat you to it.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.454
Excuse me. My name's Sean.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.789
I'm the son of Harry Wilson
and Tracy Clark.

00:44.962 --> 00:48.089
Hi.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.466
I'm Naomi.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.470
Your half-sister.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.056
Yes. Of course. Hello.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.307
Hi.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.643
Um, hi. I'm Annie.

00:59.768 --> 01:03.355
I'm your half-sister
as well, actually.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.315
How about that?
Y'all are sisters?

01:05.440 --> 01:06.942
God, no!
No, no.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.028
Um, definitely not.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.781
Well, I guess the fight is over,
without bloodshed,

01:12.907 --> 01:14.241
so I guess that's a plus.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.952
Yeah, but
who's GI Joe?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.328
Beats me.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.415
As long as he's not
another one of her exes.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.291
I say screw etiquette.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.334
Let's dig in.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.711
No! We're waiting
for Annie.

01:25.836 --> 01:27.295
I'm positively
starved!

01:27.421 --> 01:28.547
Eat a pig in a blanket.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.132
What does she mean by that?

01:31.258 --> 01:33.928
Is that some sort
of Kansas-style vulgarity?

01:34.053 --> 01:35.554
Tabitha, I was
not insulting you.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.347
Why don't you eat
a pig in a blanket?

01:37.472 --> 01:38.390
How about that?

01:40.893 --> 01:42.019
That lady...

01:42.143 --> 01:44.103
HARRY: Oh, the stories
I could tell you.

01:44.229 --> 01:44.730
Hi.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.314
Hey.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.110
This is my dad.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.653
Harry Wilson?

01:51.779 --> 01:51.987
Yep.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.364
Sean Cavanaugh.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.324
I believe that
I'm your son.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.912
My... My son?

02:00.037 --> 02:01.663
Yes, sir.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.799
TABITHA: Roman coins would melt
with envy.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.341
What a profile!

02:13.467 --> 02:15.970
Oh. Well, thanks.
It's similar

02:16.095 --> 02:17.220
to yours, Harry.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.306
Definitely a
Wilson nose,

02:19.431 --> 02:23.685
but a little less, how would
you say...? "Schnozzy."

02:23.811 --> 02:25.145
Dad's not schnozzy.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.106
I don't mean it
in a bad way.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.565
Well, I'd be proud
to have a Wilson nose.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.275
A Wilson nose.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.403
It really does kind of look
like Dad's, doesn't it?

02:33.528 --> 02:35.280
TABITHA: Go on-- before
you turned your head,

02:35.405 --> 02:37.825
you were telling us
about how you enlisted.

02:37.950 --> 02:41.954
Are you one of those patriotic
Americans I hear so much about?

02:42.079 --> 02:45.165
Right. Well, service to my
country is very important to me.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.126
But the military
is also an opportunity.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.252
You know,
a college scholarship,

02:49.377 --> 02:50.963
a chance to see the world.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.090
Not that Sadr City
and Basra

02:53.214 --> 02:54.508
were my first
choices but, hey,

02:54.633 --> 02:56.217
you take what you can get.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.470
HARRY:
How is it to be over there?

02:58.595 --> 03:00.555
SEAN:
It's crazy.
That's for sure.

03:00.681 --> 03:04.267
But it's all right.
You know, in some ways,

03:04.392 --> 03:06.436
it's less crazy
than where I came from.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.063
What do you mean?

03:08.229 --> 03:10.649
Aw, nothing. Nothing.
I just... I didn't

03:10.774 --> 03:12.901
exactly have the most
stable upbringing.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.364
I certainly didn't grow up
in a place like this.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.616
So where did
you grow up?

03:19.741 --> 03:21.118
South Carolina.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.285
That's where I was
when I was on leave

03:22.410 --> 03:24.830
when a private
investigator showed up,

03:24.955 --> 03:27.332
told me my birth
parents were
looking for me.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.583
I gotta tell you,
I couldn't believe it.

03:28.709 --> 03:32.253
But then I figured,
if not now, when?

03:32.379 --> 03:34.381
You know, I've got to ship
out in the next few weeks,

03:34.506 --> 03:37.425
and, well,
you never know.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.678
I might not ever have
another chance to meet y'all.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.889
TRACY: Where's everybody
hiding? Look at us,

03:42.014 --> 03:44.016
we're just one big happy family
now. Isn't it great?

03:44.141 --> 03:45.934
My son!

03:48.269 --> 03:49.646
Tracy Clark?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.231
Mom!

03:53.067 --> 03:54.985
Aah!

03:55.110 --> 03:56.444
Look at us.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.946
We're just one big
happy family now.

03:58.072 --> 04:28.102
Isn't it great?

04:30.979 --> 04:33.314
(sighs)

04:33.440 --> 04:35.734
I hope Sean is okay
at the Clarks'.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.485
Yeah, right.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.614
I don't want
to talk about it.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.991
Hon, did you want
Sean to stay here?

04:43.117 --> 04:45.994
Because I'm sorry
I didn't invite him.
I just figured

04:46.120 --> 04:47.996
it was your call.
No, no. That's okay.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.917
It would have been weird.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.461
More weird potentially.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.256
Are you going
to call him tomorrow?

04:57.380 --> 05:01.093
I... What do you guys think?

05:01.218 --> 05:02.761
Annie?

05:02.886 --> 05:04.596
Yeah. I'm fine with Sean.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.309
It's cool with me.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.230
I'll tell you
how I feel.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.940
Old.

05:15.065 --> 05:18.110
Now I have to reconfigure
all my math.

05:18.235 --> 05:23.907
Dixon, if I want
to be 54,

05:24.032 --> 05:27.911
how old do I have to say
I was when I had your father

05:28.036 --> 05:30.497
now that he has
a 25-year-old son

05:30.622 --> 05:32.916
he conceived
when he was 18?

05:33.041 --> 05:35.418
Eleven.

05:35.543 --> 05:39.923
Hmm. That's
a little unseemly.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.092
What about you, sweetie?

05:42.217 --> 05:43.927
How do you feel?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.471
You know, Harry, I...

05:46.596 --> 05:48.389
I don't think this
has anything to do with me.

05:48.515 --> 05:52.186
Sean is your son.
How do you feel?

05:52.311 --> 05:57.065
I feel...
I feel like I have a son,

05:57.191 --> 06:00.610
and I haven't been any sort
of father to him.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.827
Maybe he could tell
people he's only 20.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.454
That would help me.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.089
Hey, girlfriend?

06:21.215 --> 06:22.049
Yes, boyfriend?

06:22.174 --> 06:23.466
Nothing. Nothing.

06:23.591 --> 06:24.885
I just... I just
like saying that.

06:25.010 --> 06:25.635
I like hearing it.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.472
Naomi.

06:29.597 --> 06:30.974
No. It's Ethan.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.976
No. Naomi's right there.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.269
So?

06:34.393 --> 06:35.937
So I wish she wasn't.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.314
I wish she would
transfer to Uzbekistan.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.733
Or opt for
home schooling.

06:39.858 --> 06:40.984
Or spontaneously combust.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.152
All right. Take it easy.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.904
She ruined
my birthday party,

06:44.029 --> 06:45.364
and tried
to break us up.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.656
But she didn't.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.200
We're together, Annie.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.785
We're so together
we're like Siamese twins,

06:50.911 --> 06:55.082
except only of different
genders and not related,

06:55.207 --> 06:57.834
and we're sexually
attracted to each other.

07:00.461 --> 07:03.422
What's up, Ms. Gameplayer?

07:03.548 --> 07:07.426
Well, Ozzie.
Fancy meeting you here.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.929
Well, that
must feel strange.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.889
You okay?

07:11.014 --> 07:12.349
Better than okay.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.017
Okay.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.310
'Cause if you weren't,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.187
and you want to
talk or anything...

07:17.312 --> 07:21.649
No. That's... that's
really sweet of you.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.443
I have to say, it'll
be a cold day in Tijuana

07:23.568 --> 07:26.321
before I'd ever ask
you for anything.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.949
And that's
your cue to leave.

07:29.074 --> 07:32.202
Right. Of course.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.416
Annie.
Hey.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.418
I just checked in
with your dad.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.253
He said you had
kind of a big weekend.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.503
So how about we
talk in my office?

07:42.629 --> 07:45.048
You know, that's okay.
Thanks anyway.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.175
I really don't feel
like talking about anything.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.677
I was kind of trying
to make you feel
like you had a choice.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.013
You don't. How about
we talk in my office?

07:52.139 --> 07:53.181
Delightful.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.766
ADRIANNA:
So how is the thing?

07:54.891 --> 07:56.476
How is the
new brother?

07:56.601 --> 07:57.518
I was expecting a full
debriefing last night.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.188
That what you're
calling it-- debriefing?

08:00.314 --> 08:02.023
That's funny.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.942
I always took you
for a boxers kind of guy.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.526
Yeah. Well, it was
all pretty exhausting,

08:05.652 --> 08:07.070
so I just hit the hay,
you know?

08:07.195 --> 08:09.572
I mean, he seems nice,

08:09.697 --> 08:10.907
and my dad wants
to get to know him,

08:11.032 --> 08:12.367
so I guess that's nice.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.660
It sounds nice.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.956
Nah, that's nice.
That was nice.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.959
Boring! I want
to see some debriefing.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.962
A change in family dynamics

08:24.087 --> 08:27.174
can affect a lot of things.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.383
It's normal.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.344
I just wanted to check with you,

08:30.469 --> 08:32.136
make sure
you guys are talking,

08:32.261 --> 08:35.807
and finding a way to adjust
to the new situation.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.520
The way I see this,
it's a great opportunity

08:41.645 --> 08:44.191
for the two of you to maybe
help each other through this.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.360
Grow closer because of it.

08:48.820 --> 08:52.824
Would either of you
like to say anything?

08:52.949 --> 08:55.785
Uh, well, just
that Annie's a whore

08:55.910 --> 08:57.662
who went out with my
boyfriend behind my back

08:57.787 --> 08:59.039
Your ex.
after I asked her
not to.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.248
Oh, 'cause that
really justifies

09:00.374 --> 09:01.749
you ruining my
birthday party

09:01.875 --> 09:02.334
and trying to
sleep with Jason.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.877
Oh, my God,
I wouldn't try

09:04.002 --> 09:05.337
to sleep with that
corn-fed loser
KELLY:
Okay, okay.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.754
if he was the last man
on Earth...

09:06.880 --> 09:09.632
Okay, girls, uh,
that's enough of that.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.804
Look, ladies,
I just don't want you

09:14.929 --> 09:19.267
to waste your lives worrying
and fighting about guys.

09:19.393 --> 09:20.310
I mean,
don't get me wrong.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.854
Guys are good,
guys are great,

09:22.979 --> 09:26.233
but as you get older,
you start to see

09:26.358 --> 09:29.861
that having good girlfriends
is what helps you survive.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.405
God, if I could go back

09:31.530 --> 09:33.698
and tell myself this, I would.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.616
Girlfriends are so important.

09:41.206 --> 09:45.626
Uh, girlfriends are like plants.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.755
Yes, and guys

09:48.880 --> 09:50.798
are like cut flowers.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.593
You know, sure, they're pretty

09:53.718 --> 09:56.137
and, uh, they smell nice,
most of the time,

09:56.263 --> 09:58.306
but they don't last.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.017
Yes, and a plant, or a friend,

10:01.142 --> 10:03.644
if you nurture it
and take care of it,

10:03.770 --> 10:06.940
it grows and it lasts
a long, long time.

10:08.942 --> 10:09.901
Does this make sense?

10:10.026 --> 10:12.779
Does... is this helping at all?

10:23.706 --> 10:26.084
Are you doing a live
blog about lunch?

10:26.209 --> 10:27.085
Yes.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.669
I am just keeping
my public

10:28.795 --> 10:30.630
up to speed
on what's going down.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.091
Ugh, I'm thinking
that cafeteria fish tacos

10:33.216 --> 10:34.759
was a questionable choice.
Mmm.

10:34.884 --> 10:35.885
Who'd a thought?

10:36.010 --> 10:37.304
Oh, check her out.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.639
Are those Ugg boots
she's wearing?

10:39.764 --> 10:42.267
I'm sorry, did I just travel
back to 2002?

10:42.392 --> 10:43.935
Oh, that
is so going in.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.270
ETHAN:
Since when did you

10:45.395 --> 10:47.981
start caring
about fashion?

10:48.106 --> 10:49.899
SILVER:
So, where is the queen bee
gonna sit

10:50.024 --> 10:52.944
now that the King Jock
is no longer her main drone?

10:53.069 --> 10:54.779
The jocks' table?

10:56.406 --> 10:58.450
Okay, that's no longer
an option.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.909
The Mathletes.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.870
Uh, that would
be puzzling.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.956
Or, perhaps she'll join
the drama kids

11:05.081 --> 11:06.958
and do her best
to act human.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.126
(Silver laughing)

11:08.251 --> 11:09.752
SILVER:
Burn.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.671
DIXON:
Glad I'm your friend.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.175
SILVER:
The Blendeds?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.344
Bold move, Naomi.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.138
But that hive doesn't always
play nice with intruders.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.056
Sometimes they get stung.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.978
By all means,
have a seat.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.313
Thank you.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.608
Yeah, um, we don't let
sophomores sit with us.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.319
(chuckles)
I'm not your ordinary sophomore.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.736
Huh.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.489
Well, you do
accessorize well.

11:37.614 --> 11:40.617
And I like the hair--
it's very Julie Christie.

11:40.741 --> 11:41.909
Julie Christie is my godmother.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.330
We know, Tasha.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.457
I suppose you can hang
with us for a while.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.459
But we don't eat
that garbage.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.461
Yeah, we always have
a blended, one at lunch

11:51.586 --> 11:54.005
and one after school.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.299
Mmm. Cool with me.
Cool, so,

11:56.424 --> 11:57.551
uh, you wouldn't mind
getting them for us?

11:59.594 --> 12:01.680
Unless that's a problem.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.015
No, no. Not a problem at all.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.099
PORTIA:
Great.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.726
Oh, and do you think you could
program my new Sidekick for me?

12:07.852 --> 12:09.812
I just got it,
and I'm totally tech-challenged.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.190
Well, fortunately for you,
I speak fluent Sidekick.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.571
Mmm.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.614
HARRY:
Come on, guys, full speed!

12:19.738 --> 12:21.616
There's a big game tomorrow.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.159
Hey, Sean, thanks
for coming down.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.411
Well, thanks
for inviting me.

12:24.536 --> 12:25.620
You know, it's interesting.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.080
We, uh, we didn't play
a lot of lacrosse

12:27.205 --> 12:28.498
in South Carolina,
I'll tell you that.

12:28.623 --> 12:29.957
Or in Sadr City,
for that matter.

12:30.083 --> 12:30.667
(laughs)

12:34.546 --> 12:36.297
Sean...
Yeah?

12:36.423 --> 12:39.758
25 years.
That's a long time.

12:39.884 --> 12:43.430
And... I don't know
that I can ever...

12:43.555 --> 12:45.848
I don't know that I can
possibly make that up to you.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.101
Hey.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.353
You didn't even know I existed.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.314
Just seems like you haven't
had the easiest life, and...

12:53.440 --> 12:54.773
if I'd have known about you...

12:54.899 --> 12:57.068
I would have been there
and I would have helped.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.987
Mm... That's nice.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.574
But... I turned out okay.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.201
Yeah, you did.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.494
Yeah, you did.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.249
Here I go, Dad.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.668
Check it out, showtime.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.003
CHRISTINA:
Whoo! Way to go,

13:16.129 --> 13:18.256
Dixon! Whoo!

13:24.887 --> 13:27.682
Your Dad say Mr. Matthews is
coming back any time soon?

13:27.806 --> 13:31.894
He didn't say, and... okay,
I know that he's innocent

13:32.019 --> 13:34.188
and that that weird Kimberly
girl was a cop and all,

13:34.314 --> 13:37.150
but, I'm sorry, the fact that
they just assigned us Lolita...

13:37.275 --> 13:38.526
Too on the nose.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.779
I now, right! Like, come
on, you're asking for...

13:40.903 --> 13:43.197
Hey.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.616
(feigns laughter)

13:44.741 --> 13:46.326
I am so sorry, Kansas.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.995
I didn't see you
way down there.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.330
A tip for the short...

13:50.455 --> 13:52.873
wear heels.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.584
I wouldn't know what
to advise about the face.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.378
Okay, you know what?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.172
Well, take your time, honey.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.674
You can text me with a comeback.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.051
TRINITY:
Look who's here--
the Sophmore

14:04.177 --> 14:05.844
(sighs)

14:05.970 --> 14:08.973
SILVER:
Let it go, Annie,
let it go.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.767
I programmed it,

14:10.891 --> 14:12.101
customized it
and downloaded

14:12.226 --> 14:13.978
the Estelle ringtone.
Perfect.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.271
So, tell me, ladies,

14:15.396 --> 14:17.315
how is this
fairytale progressing?

14:17.440 --> 14:18.983
Am I done with my little tasks?

14:19.108 --> 14:20.652
Pretty much.
Just one more thing.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.781
You know the restaurant,
the Desiderata?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.907
Oh. Ozzie Cardoza's
family's place?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.075
Damn, girl.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.494
You're hooked up.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.787
Well...

14:30.911 --> 14:32.622
I'm not your typical sophomore.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.582
Well, they claim to be
totally booked,

14:34.708 --> 14:36.710
but um, since you're
so connected...

14:37.711 --> 14:39.462
Yeah.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.255
Done. No problem.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.048
She's pretty good.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.966
Yeah, but, um...

14:44.091 --> 14:44.634
where are our drinks?

14:47.679 --> 14:50.139
Oh... Right on time.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.182
(laughs)

14:51.307 --> 14:53.560
Thank you, Penelope.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.354
She's really good.

14:56.479 --> 14:56.979
Yeah.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.939
Soy, ladies.

14:59.065 --> 14:59.858
(low growl)

14:59.982 --> 15:01.442
Annie?

15:01.568 --> 15:02.943
No.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.572
No. Do not engage the
scary blonde chick.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.198
Do not engage her.
Stop. Don't. Don't.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.783
I have to. I have to,
Don't you go
over there.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.326
and I'll be right back.
Don't do it.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.081
So, your housekeeper
seems really nice.

15:15.206 --> 15:15.956
Is you dad doing her, too?

15:16.082 --> 15:16.999
(laughing)

15:17.124 --> 15:18.292
Oh...
Um...

15:18.418 --> 15:19.001
Wow.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.295
Uno momento.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.131
Ooh, the virgin's
getting vicious.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.550
Oh...

15:25.675 --> 15:28.135
clearly, trying to be me is
giving you a nervous breakdown.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.220
Oh, I do not want to be you.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.055
Oh. Now, sure you do.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.015
Don't touch me!

15:33.140 --> 15:35.101
Hey, hey, hey,
come on.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.060
(laughing)

15:38.312 --> 15:39.230
Enjoy my
sloppy seconds.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.567
TRINITY:
That girl is such a spaz.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.071
What was that?

15:47.196 --> 15:48.281
What's happened to you?

16:07.717 --> 16:08.885
Ozzie?

16:09.009 --> 16:11.429
Um...

16:11.554 --> 16:15.516
Listen, I feel like we kind of
started off on the wrong foot.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.977
I've been a real game
player lately. I'm sorry.

16:18.102 --> 16:21.063
Look at you with your
tail between your legs.

16:21.188 --> 16:24.734
All right, bonita.
What do you need?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.778
Reservations for four
at Desiderata tonight?

16:26.903 --> 16:27.904
Sure.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.363
Really?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.615
That's it?

16:30.740 --> 16:31.825
Yeah. I gotta go, though.

16:31.950 --> 16:35.286
Gotta go tell my tia in TJ
to go buy herself a parka.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.621
(laughs)

16:43.419 --> 16:44.796
(laughing)

16:44.921 --> 16:46.798
Hey.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.424
Hi. You were
incredible.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.759
That was amazing.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.135
Thanks. I cannot believe
that you came.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.762
That's really sweet.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.722
Well, it was part of my
New Year's resolution

16:54.848 --> 16:56.432
to see more theater.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.935
I was doing pretty good until
I saw the Blue Man Group

16:59.059 --> 17:00.269
while I was taking
cough medicine.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.395
Hideous nightmares
for weeks.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.772
Well, the Blue
Men are weird--

17:02.897 --> 17:04.440
very bald, very blue, so...

17:04.565 --> 17:06.651
Oh, it's all
coming back to me.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.904
Yeah, that, and the
fact that, um,

17:10.029 --> 17:12.114
you haven't returned any
of my phone calls.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.534
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just,
this play is really intense

17:14.659 --> 17:17.243
and then I've been
kind of busy, so...

17:17.369 --> 17:17.996
Do you want
to have lunch?

17:18.119 --> 17:19.914
Lunch?
Yeah.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.374
I know you actresses
like to stay skinny,

17:21.499 --> 17:23.291
but you gotta
eat, right?

17:23.416 --> 17:24.585
Uh, well, I mean...

17:24.711 --> 17:26.671
I have matinees
most days, so...

17:26.796 --> 17:27.630
Okay, how
about tomorrow?

17:27.755 --> 17:28.965
Are you free
tomorrow?

17:29.089 --> 17:30.216
Tomorrow?

17:30.341 --> 17:32.844
Yeah. Tomorrow I'm free.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.094
Good.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.805
Oh, this is for you.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.765
Oh, thanks.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.392
Thank you.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.310
Didn't this come
out of your office?

17:45.231 --> 17:50.028
Well! Look who went
and got herself a haircut.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.239
Your daughter turns 16 and it's
time to shear the locks, huh?

17:53.364 --> 17:55.783
What's on your
mind, Tabitha?

17:55.909 --> 17:57.702
So...

17:57.827 --> 17:59.954
I hear Harry's
going to dinner

18:00.079 --> 18:02.540
with Sean and Tracy
and you have chosen

18:02.665 --> 18:04.042
not to join them?

18:04.166 --> 18:06.586
That's right.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.965
Are you upset about the return
of the prodigal son?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.259
No, I'm not.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.386
Sean is Harry's son, not mine.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.471
I'm trying to give
Harry space to do this.

18:20.975 --> 18:25.104
Did I ever tell you about
Jean-Luc and the Chihuahua?

18:27.398 --> 18:30.276
Jean-Luc was a lover of mine.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.070
Marvelous man.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.280
Marvelous fingers.

18:34.405 --> 18:35.364
Long...

18:35.489 --> 18:37.283
delicate...

18:37.408 --> 18:39.285
sensitive...

18:39.410 --> 18:41.579
and double-jointed.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.372
Sounds like a wonderful
relationship.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.291
Oh, it was.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.293
We could have enjoyed
each other for years,

18:47.418 --> 18:48.419
Jean-Luc and I.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.713
If it wasn't for his Chihuahua.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.673
Ah, yes. The Chihuahua.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.300
Monstrous creature.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.302
Giant eyes, giant ears,

18:56.427 --> 18:59.263
the body of a rat and
the bark of a demon.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.140
But Jean-Luc adored
the flea-bitten mongrel.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.684
Let it sleep on the bed.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.353
Oh... Finally, one
night I had enough.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.355
"The dog has got to go," I said.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.733
"The dog has got to go."

19:10.858 --> 19:12.234
And you know what happened?

19:12.359 --> 19:14.070
I couldn't begin to guess.

19:14.194 --> 19:17.073
The dog went.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.533
And so did Jean-Luc.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.620
What I hadn't realized was

19:22.745 --> 19:25.581
that his Chihuahua
was my Chihuahua.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.249
What was important to him

19:27.374 --> 19:29.251
should have been
important to me.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.754
You should go
to that dinner.

19:31.879 --> 19:37.343
Sean may be Harry's son,
but Harry is your husband.

19:37.468 --> 19:39.637
He can't do this without you.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.774
O...kay.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.404
Isn't the whole point
of a reservation

19:57.530 --> 20:00.240
not having to wait?

20:00.366 --> 20:02.242
(laughing)

20:02.368 --> 20:04.120
I'll go see what
the holdup is.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.667
Excuse.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.251
Ozzie. Hi.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.419
Is the table ready?

20:12.545 --> 20:15.131
What name is it under?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.927
Oh, you lowdown, dirty,
rotten, game-playing...

20:20.053 --> 20:21.762
Oh, who? Me?

20:21.888 --> 20:22.763
Yes, you.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.473
You promised me a table.

20:24.598 --> 20:27.518
Oh, no. That must have
been my identical twin.

20:27.643 --> 20:31.271
No, you promised me a table
and I need that table right...

20:31.397 --> 20:32.773
right now.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.735
God, you are so sexy when you
are having a panic attack.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.029
It's something about
the way your cheeks flush.

20:38.154 --> 20:41.115
(sighs, laughs)

20:44.702 --> 20:45.745
You know,
I do have a table.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.705
It happens to be the best table

20:47.830 --> 20:49.331
in the house,
as a matter of fact.

20:49.456 --> 20:49.874
Well, then, give
me the table.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.085
Okay.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.753
You can have it, but
you're gonna owe me.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.254
Owe you what?

20:55.379 --> 20:57.090
Do you want the table or not?

20:57.215 --> 20:58.465
Fine. Whatever. Okay.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.800
I owe you.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.802
Good. Right this way.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.471
Come on.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.515
Finally.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.475
Apparently it's the best
table in the house.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.271
HARRY:
I want to thank the Pep Club
for the Spirit dinner.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.564
And I'd like to thank you

21:13.689 --> 21:15.566
for letting me fill in
as your head coach.

21:15.691 --> 21:16.734
It's been an honor,
and a pleasure,

21:16.859 --> 21:19.820
to watch you gentlemen grow.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.489
Congratulations on every win
that got you here,

21:22.615 --> 21:25.159
and let's cap it off
with another one tomorrow.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.493
Good luck!

21:26.619 --> 21:27.453
See you on the field!

21:27.578 --> 21:28.579
Yeah!

21:28.704 --> 21:29.997
(whooping)

21:30.123 --> 21:31.457
Destroy Bel Air!

21:31.582 --> 21:33.167
(cheering)

21:33.292 --> 21:36.420
(chanting):
Destroy Bel Air! Destroy
Bel Air! Destroy Bel Air!

21:36.545 --> 21:39.590
Destroy Bel Air!
Destroy Bel Air!

21:39.715 --> 21:40.925
Whoa!

21:44.637 --> 21:46.513
So, the man with
the fancy moves.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.182
I'm glad you noticed.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.392
I mean, you stand out.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.894
I think it's cool
what you're doing.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.354
Thanks.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.357
You're the first brother at West
Beverly to play varsity Lacrosse

21:57.483 --> 21:59.401
as long as anyone can remember.

21:59.526 --> 22:00.736
That's tight.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.362
You're our very own
Jackie Robinson.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.572
(laughs)

22:03.697 --> 22:05.574
Uh... Nah, nah.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.160
Uh... I'm...

22:07.285 --> 22:09.703
just playing lacrosse
because of my dad.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.205
You mean
Principal Wilson?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.166
Who else would I mean?

22:13.291 --> 22:14.834
Of course. Hey, chill.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.418
No, uh...

22:16.543 --> 22:18.420
guess I just been
a little stressed out

22:18.545 --> 22:19.964
with all the research
I've been doing, you know?

22:20.089 --> 22:22.424
Mmm, research?

22:22.549 --> 22:24.343
Yeah, you know, I'm...
I'm trying to find

22:24.468 --> 22:26.595
the cure for the common cold,

22:26.720 --> 22:29.223
and, uh,
global warming.

22:29.347 --> 22:29.849
Impressive.

22:29.974 --> 22:31.767
(laughing)

22:31.892 --> 22:34.520
You know, it turns out, chicken
soup is the cure for both.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.438
How about that?

22:36.563 --> 22:38.107
(both laughing)

22:38.232 --> 22:39.317
Hey, Dix, I'm going to take off.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.776
Really?

22:40.901 --> 22:42.695
Yeah, Sean showed up early.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.155
Thought I'd show him
around town

22:44.280 --> 22:45.781
before we go and pick
up Mom for dinner.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.283
Yeah.
Okay.

22:47.407 --> 22:48.617
Sure.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.454
My dad.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.290
I see.

23:00.213 --> 23:02.840
(Harry and Sean laughing)

23:11.807 --> 23:13.851
We have to have a drink
at the Hotel Bel Air.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.477
Oh, and the Polo Lounge.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.730
There's just so much
to fit in before you leave.

23:17.855 --> 23:18.522
Now I was thinking on Sunday,

23:18.647 --> 23:20.274
that we would go
to Desert Hot Springs.

23:20.398 --> 23:22.442
Because you haven't had Watsu

23:22.568 --> 23:24.862
till you've had Watsu
at Two Bunch Palms.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.822
Watsu? Is that, a...

23:26.947 --> 23:29.449
is that a kind of sushi?

23:29.575 --> 23:32.410
(laughing)
Aren't you adorable?

23:32.536 --> 23:34.705
It's water shiatsu.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.456
Watsu.

23:36.582 --> 23:37.208
But speaking of sushi,

23:37.333 --> 23:39.043
lunch tomorrow, R-23?

23:39.168 --> 23:41.379
We've already been
to Katsuya, Matsuhisa

23:41.503 --> 23:43.047
and Nobu...

23:43.172 --> 23:44.715
I've been eating a lot
of raw fish.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.717
You know, actually,
Sean, I was hoping

23:46.842 --> 23:49.011
that you could come to the
lacrosse game tomorrow.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.804
Yeah, that'd be great.

23:50.930 --> 23:51.847
TRACY:
Really?

23:51.972 --> 23:54.975
You're going to take your son

23:55.101 --> 23:56.936
to a high school
sporting event?

23:57.061 --> 23:58.562
I mean, that's what you
have to offer him?

24:01.732 --> 24:04.610
Sean, you should come stay
with us for a while.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.071
Really?

24:07.196 --> 24:09.531
Yeah, absolutely.

24:09.656 --> 24:10.283
We're your family, too.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.159
I mean, we're not fancy.

24:12.285 --> 24:13.744
We can't offer you
tuna sashimi,

24:13.869 --> 24:15.079
but I make a mean

24:15.204 --> 24:16.080
tuna casserole.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.455
SEAN:
Sounds good.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.499
And, hey, I've seen
where you live.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.584
It seems plenty
fancy to me.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.503
Oh, that's his mother's
money, not his.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.463
(mouthing)

24:27.925 --> 24:29.676
(laughing)

24:29.802 --> 24:31.595
I just had a flashback

24:31.720 --> 24:33.055
to you going all Raging Bull
on Naomi.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.056
It was amazing.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.474
Silver, stop.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.437
Sorry. Sorry.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.521
Okay, you do know we're
going to be sitting

24:41.647 --> 24:42.940
on cold metal bleachers, right?

24:43.065 --> 24:44.858
Too short?

24:44.984 --> 24:47.027
Um, let's just say
your going to need two hairdo's

24:47.153 --> 24:49.155
for that outfit.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.948
God, why do I suddenly hate
all of my clothes?

24:51.073 --> 24:52.532
Aw, your face--

24:52.658 --> 24:53.826
it was priceless.

24:53.951 --> 24:55.493
You were just like...

24:55.619 --> 24:57.455
Wait, have you ever seen the
de Kooning painting, Woman?

24:57.579 --> 24:58.747
No.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.416
Because your face looked
exactly like it.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.917
Um, it was all...

25:02.042 --> 25:03.627
(yelling)

25:11.093 --> 25:12.594
Hey, um...

25:12.719 --> 25:15.889
have I changed?

25:16.015 --> 25:18.767
Yes, like 17 times.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.518
No, I mean...

25:20.644 --> 25:23.605
I mean in...
the larger sense.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.900
I've been calling
Naomi bad, bad names

25:27.026 --> 25:28.610
and I've been dissing
her clothes.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.070
I've been shoving her.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.239
I kind of like the wild child
side of you.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.575
Oh, come on.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.870
You're not acting
any worse than she is.

25:37.995 --> 25:42.666
No, um... but I'm not acting
any better either.

25:42.791 --> 25:46.003
I swear, this is not me.

25:46.128 --> 25:47.296
Okay.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.549
So who are you?

25:51.675 --> 25:55.137
I used to a be nice person.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.349
I was a little geeky.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.226
I didn't... I didn't used
to care so much

26:00.351 --> 26:03.603
about what clothes I wore.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.731
Especially to a lacrosse game.

26:05.856 --> 26:09.235
I didn't give a crap what people
thought about me.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.154
I want to be that person again.

26:13.322 --> 26:16.283
Nobody's stopping you.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.289
That is very true.

26:27.878 --> 26:30.506
HARRY:
All right, guys,
come on bring it in.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.841
Last time we played them,
their middies were slow.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.927
Ethan, with your wheels,
you should get a lot of looks.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.429
Dixon, I want you to hit him
at the top of the triangle.

26:36.554 --> 26:37.179
DIXON:
Hey, Dad, you know what
I was thinking...

26:37.304 --> 26:39.306
DEBBIE:
Go, Wildcats!

26:39.432 --> 26:41.267
HARRY:
Hey, Sean, you made it.

26:41.392 --> 26:42.684
Never too late
to learn the game.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.937
You want to hang out
on the sidelines a bit?
Sure.

26:45.062 --> 26:46.188
All right.
Everybody,
this is Sean--

26:46.313 --> 26:48.357
my son.
SEAN:
Nice to meet y'all.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.484
Hey, man. All right, come on
team, let's bring it!

26:50.608 --> 26:51.235
Get psyched!

26:51.360 --> 26:54.612
ALL:
Go... Wildcats!

26:54.738 --> 26:56.740
Go! Go! Go! Come on!
All right, come on.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.034
I want you two to stand
over here next to me.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.421
So how are you?

27:10.546 --> 27:12.339
I'm really good.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.716
I'm sorry I didn't call
you back.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.802
It's just... with the play
I've been busy.

27:16.927 --> 27:18.429
Honestly, I haven't called
anybody back.

27:18.554 --> 27:20.556
No, that's fine. I get it.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.308
It's just, I was getting
kind of used

27:22.433 --> 27:24.351
to having you around again.

27:24.477 --> 27:25.852
It's fun hanging out with you.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.229
Yeah, but things
are different now.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.939
You know, people grow up,
the move on,

27:29.064 --> 27:30.816
they live their own lives.

27:30.941 --> 27:32.776
It's not like we're
in high school anymore.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.154
Right.

27:35.279 --> 27:37.156
What does that mean exactly?

27:37.281 --> 27:40.534
I'm not trying to hurt
your feelings,

27:40.658 --> 27:44.497
honestly, it's the last thing
I want to do, but...

27:44.622 --> 27:46.540
What do we have in common
anymore?

27:47.916 --> 27:50.336
Wow.

27:50.461 --> 27:53.671
It kind of sounds like
you're breaking up with me.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.758
No, I just...

27:56.883 --> 27:58.427
I don't want to fight
over Dylan or Ryan

27:58.552 --> 28:00.513
or whoever.

28:00.638 --> 28:04.099
You know, I'm over
all of that drama.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.725
It's just that we have
so much history.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.727
I guess I just figured...

28:07.853 --> 28:08.895
Yeah, I guess
I don't see history

28:09.021 --> 28:11.857
as a good enough reason
to keep going on this way.

28:11.982 --> 28:14.401
Especially when we haven't
learned anything

28:14.527 --> 28:16.487
from that history.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.407
You know what,
I'm kind of hungry.

28:20.533 --> 28:21.241
I'm going to order.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.369
You can go live your life.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.733
Hey, surprise, surprise.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.235
What are you gals
doing here?

28:56.360 --> 28:58.945
I'm sure I'll be asking
myself the same thing
20 minutes from now.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.322
You kidding me?

29:00.447 --> 29:02.241
There's nothing I like more
than a sporting event.

29:02.366 --> 29:03.283
I got a book,
I got an iPod,

29:03.409 --> 29:04.702
I even have a Rubik's Cube.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.203
Yeah,
of course you do.

29:06.328 --> 29:07.705
And a friend here,
largely against her will.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.289
And that.

29:09.415 --> 29:10.790
Hey, I'm here.
I'm being a good girlfriend.

29:10.916 --> 29:11.750
Yeah, speaking of
good girlfriends,

29:11.875 --> 29:13.752
do you guys know if
Annie's going to show up?

29:13.877 --> 29:16.213
Yeah, I think, um...

29:16.338 --> 29:18.340
Oh, my God, that hot dog
smells so disgusting.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.092
Ugh.

29:20.217 --> 29:22.052
I think...

29:23.637 --> 29:25.097
Oh, and then there's that.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.725
Uh, yeah, she's
probably going to make
an appearance later,

29:27.849 --> 29:30.686
so I'm going to go
deal with that.
Okay.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.024
OZZIE:
Hey, Naomi.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.818
How was dinner?

29:38.944 --> 29:41.821
Uh, well, I suppose
it was palatable enough.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.240
I give it three
and quarter stars.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.618
I just can't win with you.

29:45.743 --> 29:47.620
Oh, wait, yes, I can.

29:47.745 --> 29:49.371
You owe me.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.039
What do you want?

29:51.164 --> 29:52.541
I want a kiss.

29:54.251 --> 29:55.753
Fine.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.556
That was generous,

30:07.681 --> 30:09.141
but I didn't mean me.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.896
I want you to kiss
Walter the Wildcat.

30:15.021 --> 30:17.357
What?!

30:17.483 --> 30:19.276
Really?

30:19.401 --> 30:21.027
Is it fun for you?
Ah... yeah.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.280
Great, okay, fine.

30:23.405 --> 30:26.617
Excuse me while I go kiss
a mangy stuffed cat

30:26.742 --> 30:29.286
to satisfy your furry fetish.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.252
Could you stop moving
for one second?

30:41.465 --> 30:43.509
What...?

30:43.634 --> 30:44.593
Oh, my God, it's you?

30:44.718 --> 30:45.927
You're a freak.

30:46.052 --> 30:47.971
Whatever.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.056
Oh, you're pathetic.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.391
Annie, what the...?

30:57.272 --> 30:58.607
(laughing)

31:02.402 --> 31:04.237
Hey, so how's it
going with Naomi?

31:04.363 --> 31:06.615
Yeah, well, I don't know.

31:06.740 --> 31:08.200
I'm not quite sure
how to nurture

31:08.325 --> 31:10.285
this particular plant.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.578
I hear you.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.414
(phone ringing)
Oh, excuse me.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.291
Hello.

31:16.416 --> 31:17.584
Yes.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.294
Oh, my God, um...

31:19.419 --> 31:22.339
Okay, I'll be right there.

31:29.722 --> 31:30.848
HARRY:
Come on, Dixon,
what's wrong with you?

31:33.183 --> 31:34.643
There you go, pass it.
Pass it.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.019
Come on, Dixon,
pass it!
Watch that break.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.188
Hey, I'm open!

31:38.313 --> 31:40.148
Pass the ball, Dixon!

31:40.273 --> 31:41.525
What are you doing?!

31:46.905 --> 31:48.990
Let me get a time out.
Come on, guys!

31:49.115 --> 31:49.908
Bring it over.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.951
Hey...

31:52.077 --> 31:54.246
Hey, deep breath.

31:54.371 --> 31:56.122
Let's regroup, all right?

31:56.248 --> 31:57.207
Dixon...

31:57.332 --> 31:58.667
you need to clean
up your act.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.544
We got these
guys on skill,

32:00.669 --> 32:01.920
all right?
No need to panic.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.882
We got these guys
on skill, Dixon. Let's go.

32:05.006 --> 32:08.468
(whistle blows)
All right, everybody back
out on the field, let's go.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.053
Come on, Dix.

32:18.395 --> 32:21.398
Hey! Dix, what's
the matter with you?!

32:21.523 --> 32:21.981
(whistle blows)

32:22.107 --> 32:24.025
Oh, come on.

32:24.150 --> 32:26.194
Dave, come on.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.488
You're in for Dixon.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.365
Dixon, you're out!

32:32.785 --> 32:35.328
Hey, the way you're
playing is unacceptable.

32:36.747 --> 32:38.832
Screw you, man.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.751
What'd you say?
Screw... you.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.725
HARRY:
Hey!

32:56.850 --> 32:58.435
What was that out there?

32:58.560 --> 33:00.437
You've got to learn
to control your anger.

33:00.562 --> 33:01.939
When we're on the
field together,

33:02.063 --> 33:03.774
I'm your coach, not your dad.

33:03.899 --> 33:04.608
No kidding.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.610
You've been so busy
being Sean's dad.

33:10.823 --> 33:13.659
Sean?

33:13.784 --> 33:17.078
Yeah, Sean...
your real son.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.587
I'm sorry.

33:28.089 --> 33:31.301
I thought that you were okay
with him.

33:31.426 --> 33:36.556
Just ever since he's been here,
it's been a 24/7 SeanFest.

33:36.682 --> 33:40.894
You take him to practice,
you ditched the Spirit dinner.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.146
Can't let that guy

33:43.271 --> 33:44.940
out of your sight.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.608
Oh...

33:53.991 --> 33:56.910
(sighs)

34:03.000 --> 34:04.584
I guess...

34:04.710 --> 34:07.337
it was so sudden,
him showing up here.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.755
I...

34:08.880 --> 34:11.591
I got blindsided

34:11.717 --> 34:13.719
and didn't know how
to handle it.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.637
I'm sorry.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.516
You are my son,

34:20.641 --> 34:22.561
and genes, biology,
none of that stuff matters.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.771
What do you mean,
it doesn't matter?

34:24.897 --> 34:25.938
Of course it matters.

34:26.063 --> 34:26.899
No, it doesn't.

34:27.024 --> 34:30.150
Yeah? Then why have you been
acting the way you do?!

34:30.275 --> 34:32.237
Why does this even matter?!

34:32.362 --> 34:34.822
Why do you even care?!

34:34.947 --> 34:38.034
Without your genes,
Sean is just a total stranger.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.913
It does matter.

34:44.206 --> 34:47.335
Like, who you are,
who you're related to.

34:47.460 --> 34:51.005
It matters... to me.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.301
Like, when you're
with Sean,

34:55.427 --> 35:01.058
it makes you feel
connected to who
you are, right?

35:03.351 --> 35:07.439
Well, I want that for myself.

35:07.564 --> 35:11.610
And newsflash:
who I am is black.

35:15.072 --> 35:19.701
When we adopted you,
people kept asking questions,

35:19.826 --> 35:23.204
very well-meant.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.958
"How's he gonna know
where he's from?

35:26.083 --> 35:31.046
"How are you gonna teach him
about his heritage?

35:31.170 --> 35:35.050
How are you gonna teach him
how to shave his black hair?"

35:35.174 --> 35:36.551
(chuckles)

35:38.136 --> 35:40.680
You know what I told
those people?

35:40.806 --> 35:42.891
"I don't know.

35:43.016 --> 35:48.271
But when the time comes,
we will figure it out."

35:48.396 --> 35:52.275
Maybe the time has come
to figure it out.

35:59.908 --> 36:03.411
Yeah.

36:03.536 --> 36:04.162
(crowd cheering)

36:04.287 --> 36:07.415
The ball! Get the ball!

36:07.540 --> 36:09.250
Get him!

36:13.046 --> 36:14.213
(cheering)

36:14.339 --> 36:16.008
Yeah!

36:17.467 --> 36:18.885
Whoo!
(laughing)

36:19.011 --> 36:20.428
Whoo!
DIXON:
Whoo!

36:23.015 --> 36:25.266
Whoo!

36:25.391 --> 36:26.768
Yes!

36:26.893 --> 36:29.021
Hey, good job.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.897
That was hot.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.398
Aw, yeah!

36:32.524 --> 36:34.651
BOTH:
Yeah, yeah! (laugh)

36:34.776 --> 36:37.529
Hey, you big
athletic manly
sports stud!

36:37.654 --> 36:38.738
Thank you, thank you.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.073
Did you watch
the game?

36:40.198 --> 36:41.407
I was mostly
Rubik's Cubing.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.619
Um, who, who is that?

36:44.744 --> 36:46.287
Um...

36:46.412 --> 36:48.581
you know,
just a cheerleader.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.126
Uh, anyway, you know,
I'm glad you came.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.753
Maybe next year
you'll actually
watch me play.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.463
Oh, so you think

36:55.588 --> 36:57.841
we're gonna be
together next year.

36:57.966 --> 36:58.884
(laughs)

36:59.009 --> 37:01.011
Why not?

37:01.136 --> 37:02.929
Why not?

37:03.055 --> 37:05.306
Oh, my God, you actually won!

37:05.431 --> 37:07.308
I can't believe it!

37:07.433 --> 37:09.561
And I can't believe that
you were Walter the Wildcat.

37:09.686 --> 37:10.896
You have some
zany moves.

37:11.021 --> 37:11.897
Well, um,

37:12.022 --> 37:14.273
Jared actually got concussed
at the Spirit dinner,

37:14.399 --> 37:15.692
and I thought I'd
take his place.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.194
Why not?
Uh-huh.

37:17.318 --> 37:20.197
Look, I'm not Naomi.

37:20.321 --> 37:23.241
I'm not bitchy and slick.

37:23.366 --> 37:26.411
I don't read W magazine
and I really have no idea

37:26.536 --> 37:28.663
how many kids Brad and Angelina
have right now.

37:28.788 --> 37:33.877
I'm not mean and I'm not cool.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.712
(both chuckle)

37:35.837 --> 37:38.798
But this... this is me.

37:38.924 --> 37:42.010
I like this you.

37:42.135 --> 37:44.303
Yeah?
Yeah.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.305
Especially your tail!

37:46.431 --> 37:47.807
Oh! (laughs)

37:53.730 --> 37:56.942
So, uh, what was
the deal with you
and the creepy mascot?

37:57.067 --> 37:58.902
Oh, that was...

37:59.027 --> 38:01.238
Really bizarre?

38:03.656 --> 38:05.951
Look, you wanted a table
at Desiderata,

38:06.076 --> 38:08.620
I got the table, okay?

38:08.745 --> 38:12.040
In order to get that table,
I had to kiss the mascot.

38:12.165 --> 38:14.375
I did what I had to do.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.962
You kissed the mascot
for a table?

38:18.337 --> 38:20.173
Hardcore.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.591
I like it.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.718
I think this could be
the beginning

38:23.843 --> 38:24.970
of a beautiful friendship.

38:25.095 --> 38:27.013
Friendship
of the beautiful.

38:27.139 --> 38:28.431
(all chuckle)

38:31.184 --> 38:32.978
Hey, uh, Sean.

38:33.103 --> 38:36.189
Hey, uh, listen, I'm
sorry if me being here

38:36.314 --> 38:38.024
has been kind
of a drag, you know?

38:38.150 --> 38:39.276
It's selfish of me just
to show up like this.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.153
Ah, no, man,
you're cool, for real.

38:41.278 --> 38:42.279
No, no,
it was selfish.

38:42.403 --> 38:45.073
Yeah, my father,
adopted father,

38:45.198 --> 38:47.075
he, uh, he just
passed away.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.202
For real, man?
I'm sorry.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.496
Yeah, well, he was
kind of jerk, my dad.

38:51.621 --> 38:53.290
You know, he spent more
time playing video poker

38:53.414 --> 38:55.416
than he did trying
to raise me.

38:55.541 --> 38:59.587
I guess all I'm saying
is you're lucky.

38:59.712 --> 39:00.964
I know.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.340
Anyway, I'm sorry.

39:02.465 --> 39:03.508
Congrats
on the game, huh?

39:03.633 --> 39:04.634
I'll see you around.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.511
Hey, uh, you're not
gonna go out with us?

39:06.636 --> 39:08.221
I mean, we're all going
to celebrate.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.890
Uh, I think I've
overstayed my welcome.

39:11.016 --> 39:15.228
Nah, man, my dad
wants you here.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.772
I mean, we all want
you here.

39:17.897 --> 39:18.815
Really?

39:18.940 --> 39:21.276
Yeah, really.

39:21.400 --> 39:21.985
Come on, man.
All right.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.988
(footfalls)

39:25.113 --> 39:28.116
Well, according to your
emergency contact list,

39:28.241 --> 39:29.659
we're still BFFs.

39:29.784 --> 39:32.411
Well, if they called you,
I'm sorry.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.372
Don't be.
I was worried about you.

39:34.497 --> 39:35.456
What happened?

39:35.581 --> 39:38.084
I fell off the stage
in a blackout.

39:38.210 --> 39:41.296
It's a cursed play,

39:41.420 --> 39:44.132
and you're never actually
supposed to say its name.

39:44.257 --> 39:45.842
It's an old superstition.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.135
And I accidentally said it,

39:47.260 --> 39:48.720
and then I didn't do
the stupid ritual

39:48.845 --> 39:52.265
that you're supposed
to say when you do say it,

39:52.390 --> 39:54.184
and so here I am.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.602
You know, I heard it was
the same situation for the cast

39:56.728 --> 39:57.645
of Saved By The Bell?

39:57.770 --> 40:01.440
I can't believe
that you still came here

40:01.566 --> 40:03.442
after everything that I said.

40:03.568 --> 40:08.031
I came because we're friends,
no matter what you say.

40:08.156 --> 40:09.615
And our history means something
to me

40:09.741 --> 40:12.118
whether you want to acknowledge
it or not.

40:12.244 --> 40:14.871
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.957
I'm sorry about everything
that I said.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.835
Don't be.
You were being honest.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.131
No, I wasn't.

40:25.257 --> 40:28.843
I was actually avoiding
being honest.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.262
What do you mean?

40:30.387 --> 40:32.805
I was trying to push you away.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.640
Why?

40:36.309 --> 40:38.561
Because I slept with Ryan.

40:46.236 --> 40:47.528
(sighs)

41:01.960 --> 41:02.877
(chuckling)

41:03.002 --> 41:04.879
SEAN:
Thanks, y'all.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.047
DIXON:
No problem, man.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.840
ANNIE:
I always wanted
longer arms.

41:07.966 --> 41:08.883
All right.
All right, man

41:09.008 --> 41:11.552
Good night.
Good night, honey.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.012
Hey.
Hey, night, bud.

41:13.138 --> 41:14.764
Good night, Mom.

41:14.889 --> 41:15.807
Good night.

41:15.932 --> 41:16.808
Night, Daddy.

41:16.933 --> 41:19.227
Good night, man.
(kissing)

41:19.352 --> 41:20.770
Night, Sean.
Good night.

41:20.895 --> 41:21.729
(sighs)

41:21.854 --> 41:24.441
I appreciate you
opening up your
home to me.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.609
Hey, it's our pleasure.
We're happy to have you here.

41:26.734 --> 41:30.447
Absolutely.
Make yourself
comfortable.

41:30.571 --> 41:32.198
First door on the left.

41:32.324 --> 41:32.949
It's that way, yeah.

41:33.074 --> 41:35.160
Left, yeah.

41:35.285 --> 41:36.869
Hey...
Hmm?

41:36.995 --> 41:38.496
I want to thank you

41:38.621 --> 41:41.166
for being so great
about all this.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.334
Its tricky.

41:42.459 --> 41:47.172
Your Chihuahua
is my Chihuahua.

41:47.297 --> 41:49.341
What?

41:49.466 --> 41:50.758
(laughs)
Your family is my family.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.677

41:59.934 --> 42:02.437

42:04.605 --> 42:07.150
I'm making myself right at home.

42:07.275 --> 42:09.027
Yeah.
