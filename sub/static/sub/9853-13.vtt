♪♪

00:07.548 --> 00:09.260
Harley, how much longer?

00:09.260 --> 00:11.512
The perfume on Rachel's sleep
mask is making my eyes water.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.894
I'm trying to do
a big reveal,

00:13.894 --> 00:15.516
and all you do
is complain.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.518
You walked me
into a wall,

00:17.518 --> 00:19.730
you get to apologize
to Rachel for the blood
on her mask.

00:19.730 --> 00:23.524
Let's focus less on that
and more on this.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.567
From the woman who
brought you the Slushinator

00:26.567 --> 00:28.319
comes the next phase
of Harley innovation.

00:28.319 --> 00:30.071
Created from
the finest junk parts

00:30.071 --> 00:32.993
for her brother Ethan's
new business...

00:33.994 --> 00:35.366
Behold!

00:39.790 --> 00:42.373
This is amazing.

00:42.373 --> 00:44.545
It's gonna be perfect
for my tour business.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.967
Yeah. Hollywood tours?

00:46.967 --> 00:48.879
You know we're on
the other side of the country,

00:48.879 --> 00:51.011
and I don't see you pedaling
this thing over the Rockies.

00:51.011 --> 00:52.973
There's plenty of cool
Hollywood stuff

00:52.973 --> 00:54.725
that's happened right here
in Marshport.

00:54.725 --> 00:56.557
I mean,
who wouldn't wanna see

00:56.557 --> 00:58.309
where Kevin Hart once
got his shoes resoled?

00:59.560 --> 01:02.733
Marshport Star Tours
combines two things
that I love--

01:02.733 --> 01:05.606
talking and
watching movies.

01:05.606 --> 01:08.109
Not at the same time though.
That's not cool.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.030
Let's combine it with
the one thing I love--

01:10.030 --> 01:12.573
not having to walk to work.
Pedal away.

01:20.371 --> 01:22.463
Hey, Harley, you know
where I can get a cup?

01:22.463 --> 01:24.415
Not unless
you've got four bucks.

01:24.415 --> 01:27.338
All of these are reserved
for the crowds here

01:27.338 --> 01:28.549
for the town's
tricentennial.

01:28.549 --> 01:31.592
It's going to be
my busiest weekend
in 300 years.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.424
( bell dings )

01:33.424 --> 01:35.346
Great. A customer.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.388
I can try my special
tricentennial flavor.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.350
Red, white and blueberry.

01:41.432 --> 01:44.605

01:45.936 --> 01:47.938
Sorry. Coming right up.

Don't you break on me.

01:52.032 --> 01:54.615
Not on the biggest
weekend of the year.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.617
You owe me.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.449
I rescued you from a very
sketchy circus in Florida.

02:02.082 --> 02:04.084
ETHAN: Whoa!

02:04.084 --> 02:06.417
I'm so sorry.
That one's on me.

02:06.417 --> 02:09.419

Hey, Harls,
I'm dressing up in the store

03:29.540 --> 03:31.712
for the tricentennial
this weekend.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.464
What do you think?

03:33.464 --> 03:34.965
I think you look like
 Abuela at a wedding.

03:34.965 --> 03:38.509
Listen, I need $200
to fix my slushy machine.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.642
I may look like Abuela,
 but I'm not handing out
cash like her.

03:41.642 --> 03:43.514
Besides, I bought you
the machine.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.516
I've been letting you
keep the profits.
This bill's on you.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.898
Me? I don't have
that kind of cash.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.560
Why? Where's the money going?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.531
Good boy.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.703
I have no idea.

04:02.703 --> 04:05.075
Then I have no idea how you're
gonna pay for it. Sorry.

04:06.787 --> 04:09.169
Okay, she's all yours.

04:09.169 --> 04:11.582
I'm going over to Kiki's to work
on my smiling and waving.

04:11.582 --> 04:14.505
Good idea, 'cause you've got
texting and frowning down.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.757
It's for when I win
Marshport queen.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.339
There's a science to it.

04:18.339 --> 04:21.341
Beauty queens
wave in figure eights.

04:21.341 --> 04:23.384
I'm going to do
something more original.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.651
I'm running for
Marshport queen, too.

04:30.651 --> 04:31.892
( laughing )

04:31.892 --> 04:33.524
That's ridiculous.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.567
That's so ridiculous,
I laughed.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.569
That's a good queen laugh.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.571
You're too young to be
in the competition.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.573
No, I'm not.
I checked the rules.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.405
You just have to be
a Marshport resident.

04:44.405 --> 04:46.787
( laughs )

04:46.787 --> 04:48.829
Now that's
a good queen laugh.

04:48.829 --> 04:50.791
RACHEL: Ugh!

04:50.791 --> 04:53.794
Hello!
I have places to be.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.966
Who's taking me?

04:55.966 --> 04:57.798
Deathnee does not
like to be late.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.010
Ethan, your turn to take
Daphne to her playdate.

05:00.010 --> 05:01.131
I'll take her.

05:01.131 --> 05:02.843
Oh, thanks, Harls.

05:02.843 --> 05:05.596
- For 200 bucks.
- Ethan, you're up.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.598
But, Dad, I've gotta get
my tours going.

05:07.598 --> 05:10.851
Sorry. Mom and the boys
are away, and I need your help.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.855
I wish there was
a kid shuttle service.

05:14.855 --> 05:16.777
I don't have time for this.

05:16.777 --> 05:19.650
Excuse me for
having friends, loser.

05:24.655 --> 05:26.577
A kid shuttle service?

05:28.078 --> 05:30.951
I just found a way
to make 200 bucks.

05:30.951 --> 05:34.044
Me, lead
the tricentennial parade?

05:34.044 --> 05:36.957
I know we've been
power-walking the mall
for two months now,

05:36.957 --> 05:39.219
but you think
I got the stuff?

05:39.219 --> 05:42.673
I know by the way
you pass up free samples
at Pretzel Pier.

05:42.673 --> 05:44.675
You've got focus.

05:44.675 --> 05:46.597
Or bad peripheral vision.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.679
Either way, you're
right for the gig.

05:48.679 --> 05:51.682
Even if I wanted to,
why would they choose me?

05:51.682 --> 05:54.435
It's not they,
it's me.

05:54.435 --> 05:57.027
You're walkin' with
the head of the
parade committee,

05:57.027 --> 05:59.029
and I got pull.

05:59.029 --> 06:02.693
And a recipe for banana bread
they'll never see again

06:02.693 --> 06:03.904
if they don't choose you.

06:03.904 --> 06:05.746
I don't know.

06:05.746 --> 06:07.658
It seems like
such a huge responsibility.

06:07.658 --> 06:08.659
I mean, leading
the whole parade,

06:08.659 --> 06:11.251
carrying that giant flag.

06:11.251 --> 06:13.834
There's even a surprise
celebrity guest.

06:13.834 --> 06:15.796
The entire world
will be watching.

06:15.796 --> 06:18.709
Well, just Marshport
and some shut-ins who
like the parade coverage.

06:18.709 --> 06:21.301
I'll train you.

06:21.301 --> 06:24.845
I once trained the greatest
parade leader of all time.

06:24.845 --> 06:26.847
- Who?
- Me.

06:29.770 --> 06:32.012
And that concludes our tour.

06:32.012 --> 06:34.354
Thanks for riding with
Marshport Star Tours,

06:34.354 --> 06:36.356
where you're only one star
and 3,000 miles

06:36.356 --> 06:38.689
away from Hollywood.
Mention my name at the register

06:38.689 --> 06:41.021
- for a ten percent discount.
- Listen!

06:41.021 --> 06:43.904
I figured out a way to get
my slushy machine fixed,

06:43.904 --> 06:45.866
- but I need to ask you
a big favor.
- Yes, whatever you need.

06:45.866 --> 06:48.949
Sure, no is your first answer,
but I need it part-time

06:48.949 --> 06:51.371
for a fantastic
business idea.

06:51.371 --> 06:54.745
Harley Car, the on-demand
taxi service for parents.

06:54.745 --> 06:56.917
Harley, I said yes.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.749
Yes?

06:58.749 --> 07:00.841
I'm not really
booked up on tours right now.

07:00.841 --> 07:02.753
Plus, you did make
the pedi-cab.

07:02.753 --> 07:05.716
So how about I take
mornings, you take afternoons?

07:05.716 --> 07:08.258
Sounds good. The mini mart
where four Maroon 5's

07:08.258 --> 07:10.681
bought a six pack of ginger ale
doesn't open until noon.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.976
Okay, good,
you're here.
We need to talk.

07:15.976 --> 07:18.979
If you were as classy
as you pretend to be,

07:18.979 --> 07:20.861
you would know
it's tea time.

07:20.861 --> 07:23.774
- Would you like to join us?
- Fine. Sure. Whatever.

07:28.909 --> 07:30.070
Okay, I'm here to talk--

07:30.070 --> 07:31.912
You're not drinking
your tea.

07:36.336 --> 07:38.418
Ooh! That's hot.

07:38.418 --> 07:40.961
It's invisible.
Don't over-play.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.794
Fine. I'm here
to talk about
Marshport queen.

07:43.794 --> 07:46.006
You can't compete;
it's completely ridiculous.

07:46.006 --> 07:48.428
Look, I get it.
You're scared.

07:48.428 --> 07:51.221
No, I'm looking out for you.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.973
You're seven.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.096
The queen has to speak,
have talent, poise.

07:56.096 --> 07:59.860
It's a position
that really requires
all of your adult teeth.

07:59.860 --> 08:02.983
Somebody just lost
the tooth fairy vote.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.945
Scone?

08:04.945 --> 08:07.778
Look, only one person
can be the face of this family.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.821
Like Kate Middleton
will get to be the queen,

08:10.821 --> 08:14.875
and Pippa will get to say
her sister with the better
hair is the queen.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.667
I'm Kate, you're Pippa.

08:16.667 --> 08:19.790
( British accent )
Hi, Kate, I'm Pippa.
You're going to lose.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.544
Hollywood Harley Car,

08:23.544 --> 08:25.295
the kid with the bike
to transport your tyke.

08:25.295 --> 08:27.968
I have three calls
before you. Please hold.

08:27.968 --> 08:30.631
Harley Car is blowing up.

08:30.631 --> 08:33.053
I've already made enough
to fix my slushy machine,

08:33.053 --> 08:35.556
which, as you may recall,
also blew up.

08:35.556 --> 08:36.847
How's the tours going?

08:36.847 --> 08:39.559
Not the big money maker,
but a lot of fun.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.852
I took 100 photos
of the Muncie family

08:41.852 --> 08:43.813
at the airport where
Selena Gomez lost her luggage.

08:43.813 --> 08:45.946
Ho ho hold on to
your claim ticket.

08:47.858 --> 08:50.280
Hi. Do you have any
Harley Car openings
this afternoon?

08:50.280 --> 08:52.152
Oh, sorry, Harley Car's
in the morning.

08:52.152 --> 08:54.615
Star Tours
is in the afternoon.

08:54.615 --> 08:56.246
That's too bad.
I don't even need the ride.

08:56.246 --> 08:58.869
I need some me time.
I'd pay you double the rate

08:58.869 --> 09:01.501
just to have someone take him
off my hands for an hour.

09:01.501 --> 09:03.964
( evil laughter )

09:03.964 --> 09:07.628
Oh, so you basically
just want a babysitter.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.435
What about a babysitter
who knows cool stuff
about Marshport?

09:15.435 --> 09:16.977
Only thing he needs to know

09:16.977 --> 09:19.600
is not to bring my kid back
in less than an hour.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.851
See you at 3:00.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.857
Harley Car just merged
with Star Tours.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.069
Well, more like absorbed
Star Tours.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.992
Well, more like
a secret takeover.

09:31.992 --> 09:33.614
Look, what matters is,

09:33.614 --> 09:35.996
I'm going to be making
a ton of money

09:35.996 --> 09:38.999
from these desperate suckers.

09:38.999 --> 09:40.911
Oh, sorry, ma'am.

09:40.911 --> 09:43.123
I didn't put you on hold.

09:43.123 --> 09:45.125
Do you mind not mentioning
my secret plan?

09:45.125 --> 09:46.797
Thanks.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.713
I don't know
how you did it,

09:52.713 --> 09:54.845
but my tours
are fully booked
this afternoon.

09:54.845 --> 09:58.098
- I can't believe it.
- Believe it.
That's what Harley do.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.981
Harley also do
white lies,

10:00.981 --> 10:03.684
half-truths, and just plain
leaving things out.

10:03.684 --> 10:06.566
Like the fact that I renamed
Ethan's business Harley Care.

10:07.567 --> 10:10.941
Hi. We're here for
Harley Care.

10:10.941 --> 10:15.115
It's actually pronounced
Star Tours.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.698
You're a little younger
than the customers
I was expecting.

10:17.698 --> 10:19.910
I told you the age
limit was 12.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.912
They were begging me.

10:21.912 --> 10:25.796
"Where can I ride in
a lobster while learning?"

10:25.796 --> 10:27.587
There's only one answer,
Ethan,

10:27.587 --> 10:29.089
and you know what it is.

10:29.089 --> 10:30.801
Tickets, please.

10:30.801 --> 10:33.093
I've gotta carry this
the whole parade?

10:33.093 --> 10:35.175
It's a lot heavier
than I thought.

10:35.175 --> 10:38.058
Keep it up there.
Don't let that flag
touch the ground.

10:38.058 --> 10:41.892
The Rotary Club of
Marshport has eyes
everywhere.

10:43.353 --> 10:45.395
Georgie, we need
your help.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.067
- Kinda busy right now.
- This is good.

10:47.067 --> 10:49.189
The parade route is
unpredictable.

10:49.189 --> 10:50.941
You need to be ready
for anything.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.774
I once got struck by lightning,
kept right on marching.

10:53.774 --> 10:56.196
We both wanna be
parade queen.

10:56.196 --> 10:58.829
You need to pick
who should run,
and who should drop out.

10:58.829 --> 11:00.701
Which one of us should be
Marshport queen?

11:00.701 --> 11:03.163
This or that?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.165
That's old news.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.918
This is what's happening
right now.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.791
I'm not going to choose
between my sisters.

11:10.791 --> 11:12.793
I got no problem.
Show me what you got.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.441
The little one.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.945
If I had one wish,

11:34.945 --> 11:37.447
it would be for
world peace.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.033
If I had one wish,

11:43.033 --> 11:45.956
it would be to hug
all the children of the world.

11:47.417 --> 11:49.169
Awww.

11:51.631 --> 11:52.632
The little one.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.813
The big one.

12:12.813 --> 12:14.775
You're out.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.066
The little one wins.

12:16.066 --> 12:17.157
This is so not fair!

12:19.029 --> 12:22.702
I don't know who you are,
strange lady at our house,

12:22.702 --> 12:24.454
but I like you.

12:29.579 --> 12:31.291
I feel bad for Rachel,

12:31.291 --> 12:33.173
but I'm super glad
Daphne does not wanna
be parade leader.

12:33.173 --> 12:36.256
You should be.
That kid sparkles.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.218
Now, we're gonna
get marching.

12:38.218 --> 12:40.050
From here through
the parade route and back.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.052
We're gonna march
and march till you can do it

12:42.052 --> 12:44.054
with your eyes closed.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.686
This time, I'll try
to not take out
any street signs.

12:46.686 --> 12:50.100
And... step.

12:54.064 --> 12:57.107
Movie buffs like yourselves
will be excited to learn

12:57.107 --> 12:58.608
that on your right
is a nail salon

12:58.608 --> 13:00.450
owned by Jennifer Lawrence's
third cousin.

13:00.450 --> 13:04.534
Stop talking. I'm trying
to play my video game!

13:07.077 --> 13:09.619
A friend for you,
a friend for you,

13:09.619 --> 13:11.872
a friend for you.

13:11.872 --> 13:13.293
( horns blowing loudly )

13:13.293 --> 13:15.545
And movie buffs like yourselves
will be excited to learn

13:15.545 --> 13:18.128
that on your right
is a nail salon

13:18.128 --> 13:21.181
owned by Jennifer Lawrence's
third cousin.

13:21.181 --> 13:23.513
Harley, good news.

13:23.513 --> 13:25.635
The part for your
slushy machine came in.

13:25.635 --> 13:28.558
Thanks, but that was
yesterday's problem.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.100
I'm all about
the Benjamins now.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.102
Huh.

13:34.774 --> 13:36.566
On your right...

13:36.566 --> 13:39.359
the nail salon....

13:39.359 --> 13:42.492
Lawrence...
third cousin.

13:46.496 --> 13:49.249
Wow. I knew you wouldn't
like this outfit,

13:49.249 --> 13:51.501
but you've actually
got tears in your eyes.

13:51.501 --> 13:54.004
I do hate it,
but it's not about that.

13:54.004 --> 13:56.126
Daphne's running for
Marshport queen,
and I can't beat her.

13:56.126 --> 13:59.129
It's like running against
a puppy wrapped in
a baby panda.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.340
Awww.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.013
That right there,
that's why I'm out.

14:03.013 --> 14:05.265
I waited to run
until this year

14:05.265 --> 14:07.307
so I could be queen
for the tricentennial.

14:07.307 --> 14:09.389
There's going to be
a surprise celebrity guest,

14:09.389 --> 14:11.351
and I want to do the queen
wave on the float next to them.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.732
Do you know how good
this would've looked for my--

14:12.732 --> 14:14.144
College applications?

14:14.144 --> 14:15.976
I was gonna say
web presence.

14:15.976 --> 14:18.148
I guess it doesn't
matter anymore.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.190
Some dreams you just
have to let die.

14:20.190 --> 14:24.404
Hey, you will always be
the queen of my heart.

14:24.404 --> 14:26.576
Okay, that right there,
that just made me sadder.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.203
Harley Care.
We care when you don't.

14:33.203 --> 14:36.836
Absolutely we can book you for
two hours tomorrow afternoon.

14:36.836 --> 14:38.498
Just remember to call it
Star Tours

14:38.498 --> 14:40.260
for a five-percent discount
on your babysitting ride.

14:40.260 --> 14:43.133
Babysitting ride?!

14:44.965 --> 14:48.348
It's actually called
Harley Care.

14:48.348 --> 14:50.600
But I'm guessing that's not
going to make this any better.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.186
You turned my tours
into mobile daycare.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.398
This isn't what
I wanted to do.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.361
I wanted to give tours
to people who care
about Hollywood history.

15:01.361 --> 15:04.524
- These kids care.
- All they care about is
throwing stuff at me.

15:07.197 --> 15:09.659
At least you had bookings.

15:09.659 --> 15:13.033
Face it. There's more demand
for my business than yours.

15:13.033 --> 15:14.084
So?

15:14.084 --> 15:17.037
So join Harley Care,

15:17.037 --> 15:19.669
and we can suck
the child care dollars
right out of this town.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.301
Listen to yourself.

15:21.301 --> 15:23.803
You sound like
a babysitting supervillain.

15:23.803 --> 15:26.176
We're just two
different people, Harls.

15:26.176 --> 15:28.218
I don't care about money.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.050
You know what?

15:30.050 --> 15:32.472
Keep the cab.
I quit.

15:32.472 --> 15:34.474
But we're booked solid.

15:34.474 --> 15:37.267
No. You're booked solid.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.270
Don't forget your helmet.
Those malt balls sting.

15:43.823 --> 15:45.905
( laughing )

15:47.447 --> 15:48.698
Ethan's not wrong.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.700
This is not super fun,
but who cares?

15:50.700 --> 15:52.122
I'm making money.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.495
Knock it off, you two.

15:55.495 --> 15:57.417
Do not make me
come back there.

16:10.350 --> 16:13.893
( wistful music plays )

16:37.537 --> 16:39.329
Welcome back, Slushy.

16:39.329 --> 16:41.501
Now there's just one more
thing I have to fix.

16:43.543 --> 16:46.046
I wanna talk to you about
the Marshport queen pageant.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.508
You want me to mention
your store in my victory speech?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.430
Done.

16:50.430 --> 16:53.393
Listen, we both know
you have a really good
shot at winning this thing.

16:53.393 --> 16:55.345
I'm pretty much a lock.

16:55.345 --> 16:59.269
You know, this pageant
is really important
to your sister.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.481
You have a lot of years
you can win this,

17:01.481 --> 17:03.313
but she doesn't.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.355
Something to think about.

17:05.355 --> 17:07.237
I'll give you a little
peace and quiet.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.203
Close the roof
behind you.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.327
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed
Marshport Star Walking Tours.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.368
Hollywood glamour
is just a stroll away,

17:19.368 --> 17:21.461
with two moderate hills.

17:21.461 --> 17:23.333
Exit's this way.

17:26.925 --> 17:28.428
( bicycle bell rings )

17:28.428 --> 17:30.340
Hey, E.

17:30.340 --> 17:33.093
I see you're doing
walking tours now.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.305
It's not just walking.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.557
We also accept
inline skaters.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.309
How's Harley Care going?

17:39.309 --> 17:41.020
We closed.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.812
Harley won't be caring
anymore.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.355
Why? You're making
so much money.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.357
You were right.

17:47.357 --> 17:50.570
There are more important
things than making money.

17:50.570 --> 17:54.574
I realized slinging slushies
was my first love.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.696
Did you do that thing
where you talk to the machine?

17:56.696 --> 17:58.788
That's none of your business.

17:58.788 --> 18:01.371
The point is,
I'm sorry.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.373
So I'm giving you back
the pedi-cab.

18:06.376 --> 18:09.209
I want you to do
what you love.

18:09.209 --> 18:10.710
Thanks, Harls.

18:10.710 --> 18:14.134
Marshport Star Tours
is back on wheels!

18:14.134 --> 18:15.925
You wanna talk to
the pedi-cab?

18:15.925 --> 18:18.638
Go ahead.
Talk to the pedi-cab.

18:18.638 --> 18:22.932
Nah. I like to keep it
more of a boss-employee
relationship.

18:22.932 --> 18:25.565
Well, can your employee
give me a ride?

18:25.565 --> 18:26.606
Because I'd love a tour.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.858
Hop in.

18:32.942 --> 18:35.445
We're actually standing in front
of a landmark right now.

18:35.445 --> 18:37.447
If you look straight ahead,
you will see

18:37.447 --> 18:39.659
where singer Rachel Platten
recorded her first demo.

18:39.659 --> 18:43.453
Is there some sort of
hologram feature on this tour,

18:43.453 --> 18:45.745
- because I feel like
I'm seeing her.
- Oh, thank goodness.

18:45.745 --> 18:47.417
I thought I was
hallucinating

18:47.417 --> 18:48.878
from walking all those
moderate hills.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.961
She must be the surprise
celebrity guest.

18:51.961 --> 18:54.093
She's waving us down.
What do we do?

18:54.093 --> 18:57.467
Hey, lobster.
Yeah, you guys.

18:57.467 --> 18:58.678
She's a celebrity.

18:58.678 --> 19:00.430
We do what she says.

19:00.430 --> 19:03.102
Hi. Thank you guys so much
for pulling over.

19:03.102 --> 19:06.396
My driver's stuck
in parade traffic.
Can you get me to my float?

19:06.396 --> 19:08.898
Absolutely,
Rachel Ashley Platten.

19:08.898 --> 19:12.071
who used to enjoy
root beer floats at
Swanny's Seasonal Custard Shop.

19:15.485 --> 19:18.448
Quit scaring Rachel Platten.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.583
Step, one, two.

19:23.583 --> 19:26.286
Step, step, step.

19:26.286 --> 19:28.338
As the man who taught
Georgie to walk,

19:28.338 --> 19:30.710
I am impressed you
taught her to march.

19:30.710 --> 19:33.633
I taught a cat to fetch,
and this was harder.

19:33.633 --> 19:36.466
But when Georgie trains,
she gives it her all.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.508
Two, step, step.

19:38.508 --> 19:41.261
Step, one, two.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.517
Two, step, step.

20:02.742 --> 20:05.325
Step, step.

20:05.325 --> 20:07.086
Why is she turning left?

20:07.086 --> 20:08.828
Uh-oh.

20:08.828 --> 20:11.541
She's so locked in,
she's doing her
training route.

20:14.003 --> 20:16.256
Where does that end?

20:16.256 --> 20:18.548
Step, step...

20:18.548 --> 20:20.550
Yes! I did it!

20:26.306 --> 20:28.978
Wrong turn.
My bad.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.190
Go back.
Go back!

20:33.943 --> 20:36.696
Oh, no. No, no!

20:41.701 --> 20:43.162
(pedi-cab horn honks )

20:43.162 --> 20:46.456
( bicycle bell dings )

20:47.707 --> 20:50.420
How'd this parade end up
in our backyard?

20:50.420 --> 20:52.131
'Cause Georgie
was leading it.

20:52.131 --> 20:54.374
Wait a second.
I'm singing in a backyard?

20:54.374 --> 20:57.136
I've gotta talk to my agent
about these gigs.

22:58.548 --> 23:01.671
Find out how a local town's
 tricentennial parade

23:01.671 --> 23:04.263
ended up behind
 one family's home.

23:04.263 --> 23:06.676

 was in my yard.
