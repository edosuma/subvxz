- It's gonna be fine.

19:12.346 --> 19:16.381
Albert, I am so sorry
that I was horrible to you.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.851
You were gone for three days!

19:19.853 --> 19:21.152
Exactly!

19:21.154 --> 19:22.954
And you already had
a funeral for me?

19:22.956 --> 19:24.956
I gave you $2 million
to stay away.

19:24.958 --> 19:26.858
Can we not talk
about this right now?

19:26.860 --> 19:28.259
Albert has a tomahawk
in his chest!

19:28.261 --> 19:29.861
Sometimes I think you care
more about Albert

19:29.863 --> 19:31.296
than you do my remarriage.

19:31.298 --> 19:34.299
Oh, you're finally getting it,
are you, sister?

19:35.567 --> 19:36.667
[door slams]

19:36.969 --> 19:38.102
Oh, my Albert.

19:38.104 --> 19:39.637
My Albee-Walbee.

19:39.639 --> 19:42.306
No one will ever replace you.

19:45.644 --> 19:49.880
Hello, I'm Dr. Goldberg,
Albert's doctor.

19:49.882 --> 19:52.449
I'll be living here
while taking care of Albert.

19:52.451 --> 19:55.318
Hello, my name is Victor.

19:55.320 --> 19:59.690
And I'm incredibly
vulnerable right now.

19:59.692 --> 20:02.192
Let the healing begin.

20:02.194 --> 20:05.195
Langundo, Little One,
other people,

20:05.197 --> 20:06.396
you should go.

20:06.398 --> 20:08.765
Brother Mitch,
come home with us.

20:08.767 --> 20:10.133
This is my home.

20:10.135 --> 20:12.068
The choice is simple--

20:12.070 --> 20:15.505
a life of honor
among dignified people

20:15.507 --> 20:17.174
or a life of lowly servitude

20:17.176 --> 20:19.108
in the basement
of a veritable asylum.

20:19.110 --> 20:20.443
But without me,

20:20.445 --> 20:23.345
who would express
the peacock's anal glands?

20:23.347 --> 20:25.148
Who would beat the children?

20:25.150 --> 20:27.216
I'm a part of this family.

20:27.218 --> 20:29.185
[laughs]
No, you're not.

20:29.187 --> 20:33.522
Garfield could be trained
to be the butler.

20:34.591 --> 20:36.425
It seems like they'll be fine.

20:36.427 --> 20:38.460
I'm sorry, brother,
I cannot leave.

20:38.462 --> 20:40.329
My role here
among these people--

20:40.331 --> 20:43.598
Oh, Garfield,
you're the new butler now.

20:46.535 --> 20:50.706
White people show their love
in a different way.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.140
Go.

20:52.142 --> 20:54.076
Go with Great Spirit.
