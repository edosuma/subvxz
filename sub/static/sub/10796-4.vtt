00:00.680 --> 00:02.648
You went to the police, Rose.

00:02.800 --> 00:05.087
Maybe it was some other girl
that you were seeing,

00:05.240 --> 00:07.163
<i>There was no other girl.</i>

00:07.840 --> 00:09.285
(She shrieks and cries)

00:09.440 --> 00:12.046
GIBSON: <i>Our prime suspect, Paul Spector.</i>

00:12.200 --> 00:14.521
We need to find him, put him under surveillance

00:14.680 --> 00:17.570
and hope that he leads us to Rose
before it's too late.

00:17.720 --> 00:21.964
So, just to be clear, you were with Paul Spector
from 9:30 that night

00:22.120 --> 00:24.771
- till after three the following morning?
- Yes.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.605
We've found something.
It's not the phone. It's a phone case.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.207
- Oh, God, what am I doing?
- Going with the flow.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.647
- Are you pleased with me?
- Not particularly.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.280
- I'm protecting you-
- I don't need your protection.

00:36.440 --> 00:39.171
- Slop.
- Please. Please, Stella.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.006
<i>- Have you had a good evening?</i>
- Yes, thanks.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.640
<i>- You?
- It's been fun.</i>

Rick...I need a new laptop.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.088
- Where's yours?
- In an evidence bag.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.447
- What?
- Long story.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.367
How do I log in on this?

02:13.120 --> 02:14.645
Thanks.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.602
GREEN: Ma'am?

02:26.800 --> 02:28.802
One second.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.564
That car you saw, up on the hill...

02:38.720 --> 02:40.449
with the changed plates...

02:40.600 --> 02:42.443
It was stolen from here.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.967
That was the morning after the phone call

02:45.120 --> 02:48.329
and close to where the cover
of Roses phone was found.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.960
And there is the Goodall Farm.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.720
We should get a helicopter up, Ged.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.008
One with thermal imaging.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.288
Looking particularly for remote outbuildings,

03:00.440 --> 03:03.046
anything that can be a potential hiding place.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.647
Anywhere he could be keeping Rose Stagg
or Rose Stagg's remains.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.809
I need to talk to you about last night.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.962
I have something to show you.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.522
Come round.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.680
This is taken from the CCTV camera

04:37.840 --> 04:40.241
on the corridor of my hotel.

04:41.600 --> 04:45.525
That's my room at 22:14.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.284
BURNS: Who is it?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.362
I believe it's Paul Spector.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.883
And that's me...

04:57.040 --> 04:59.361
entering my room just after eleven.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.887
Are you telling me he was in there with you?

05:02.880 --> 05:05.531
Been in there for 45 minutes.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.766
It gets better.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.651
That's you arriving...just after eleven.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.689
He was in there with both of us?

05:14.360 --> 05:16.044
And that's him leaving.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.169
Note the time.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.041
- Where the hell was he?
- There's only one place he could have been.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.729
In there.

05:30.880 --> 05:34.680
That's where we had our...misunderstanding.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.171
Oh, God.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.004
And then we were there.

05:38.160 --> 05:41.801
I suppose, when I was cleaning your face,
he slipped away.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.450
So he heard me.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.729
Oh, forget your private embarrassment
for a minute.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.362
You were talking about Father...
whatever he calls himself.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.888
And I'm pretty sure
that you referred to Spector by name.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.930
- Are you certain?
- Not certain.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.443
But if you did...

06:00.600 --> 06:02.807
he knows that we're onto him.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.969
Stand by from 5.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.851
That's the Benedetto girl

06:09.000 --> 06:11.162

DAISY: Oh, I'm so not up for this.
I've had, like, two hours' sleep.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.528
- Same.
- How come?

06:22.400 --> 06:25.051
- I had dinner with Paul-
- Really?

06:25.200 --> 06:27.328
- Yes.
- And?

06:27.480 --> 06:30.086
- It was amazing.
- What happened?

06:30.240 --> 06:32.891
- We talked.
- What happened after?

06:33.040 --> 06:35.964
- I came home.
- Why? Did he go home to his wife?

06:36.120 --> 06:38.964
- Hold you, he's left his wife.
- Yeah, sure.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.929
That was us last night.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.481
- I don't see his wife anywhere.
- My God! Let me see!

06:47.640 --> 06:49.642
Katie, you recorded him.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.405
- Were you doing the same?
- Maybe.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.244
What if he recorded you?

06:55.400 --> 06:58.210
- I don't think he's like that.
- Oh, no, of course not.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.442
- Let me see.
- (They giggle)

07:10.160 --> 07:12.606
I suppose, in his mind, that must be me.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.685
Which makes that thing...him.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.888
He also read my dream diary.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.763
What?

07:23.920 --> 07:25.922
I keep a journal.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.961
He left an entry for me.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.731
Does your journal contain procedural stuff?

07:45.720 --> 07:48.530
I've trained myself
to wake up and write down dreams,

07:48.680 --> 07:50.682
passing thoughts.

07:51.240 --> 07:55.484
I did it first as an investigative thing,
but now I can't stop doing it.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.920
It's not procedural.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.722
It's personal.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.729
And now it's lost to me.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.201
Seized as evidence.

08:09.680 --> 08:13.048
Our modern life is such an unholy mix of...

08:14.080 --> 08:15.923
...voyeurism and exhibitionism.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.082
People perpetually broadcasting

08:18.240 --> 08:21.050
their internal and external selves.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.568
My diary is private.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.202
It is not intended for publication.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.562
Do you think if I hadn't turned up last night
he would have...

08:33.520 --> 08:37.650
- Do you think he was planning to attack you?
- ls that how you see yourself?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.162
As my protector?

08:41.320 --> 08:43.368
I came hereto apologise.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.884
No...

08:49.640 --> 08:51.768
...there's no need.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.121
I nearly made the same mistake as you
last night

08:56.280 --> 08:58.009
You did?

09:02.280 --> 09:06.604
We all have physical, emotional needs
that can only be met”.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.527
“By interaction with another person.

09:12.200 --> 09:16.205
Trick is...to ask someone appropriate
to meet them.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.682
<i>Why can't you marry your daddy?</i>

09:51.200 --> 09:54.090
Do you mean, why can't little girls
marry their daddies?

09:54.240 --> 09:55.571
Yes.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.327
- Do you want to marry Daddy?
- Can I?

10:00.800 --> 10:03.121
He's already married, to me.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.564
He's taken.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.768
But...if you don't want him...

10:10.920 --> 10:15.209
Some day, when you're older, like Mummy,
you can marry a nice man like Daddy.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.682

10:35.480 --> 10:37.482
(Camera clicking)

10:56.240 --> 10:59.562
Looks like Spector's qualifications
as a counsellor are for real.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.202
They were checked out when he was first
employed by the local authority.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.010
Two main things to follow up on.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.687
Spector had been counselling
a married couple - James and Elizabeth Tyler.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.320
Their son died of meningitis. Ten years old.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.245
James Tyler...Jimmy...

11:14.400 --> 11:16.289
is well known to us.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.886
Seems that James,
following the death of his son,

11:19.040 --> 11:22.010
became a bit free with his fists,
as far as Liz was concerned.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.607
Spector advised Liz to report him
to the Domestic Violence Unit.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.649
She was reluctant.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.361
James was out of prison on licence.
Anything like that would put him back inside-.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.841
Spector was persuasive.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.525
Liz made the call.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.286
She's now in a women's refuge
in Bangor somewhere.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.851
Is James back in prison?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.367
Out on bail. Tagged with curfew conditions.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.410
Pay her a visit.
Don't lei anyone else see that address.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.846
No, ma'am.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.764
Spector had a run-in with James Tyler

11:48.920 --> 11:52.447
about an unscheduled house call
he made on Liz when she was home alone'

11:52.600 --> 11:55.490
Chandler and his boss had occasion
to reprimand Spector.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.927
This was on the day of the Joe Brawley murder.

11:58.680 --> 12:03.846
Spector behaved bizarrely - walked out.
Never came back. Disappeared.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.803
- Behaved bizarrely?
- Yes.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.041
How?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.366
How?

12:12.880 --> 12:14.928
- That's what I said.
- That's what I said.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.605
- What?
- What?

12:16.760 --> 12:19.127
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing what he did.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.442
What are you doing?

12:21.600 --> 12:24.080
I see. Mirroring.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.006
Spector's still registered
as a freelance bereavement counsellor.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.725
So...that would be Fine Art.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.211
Would it?

12:39.280 --> 12:41.647
Yes, it would.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.170
Rick...

12:52.320 --> 12:56.450
The Alice Monroe Fund sent a bereavement
counsellor to talk to Annie Brawley.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.171
Do we have his or her name on file?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.368
I don't seem to have that information-.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.649
I know the Fund found someone
accredited and approved.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.971
- Who's guarding Annie today?
- Hagstrom?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.807
Can you get her on me phone?

13:21.480 --> 13:23.562
- Are you finished?
LIAM: Yes.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.169
Here...

13:28.080 --> 13:29.684
- Go play?
- Mm-hm.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.330
Go on, then.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.362
HAGSTROM: The hairdressers just arrived.
- What hairdresser?

13:54.520 --> 13:57.490
Oh, that's something her therapist
organised for Annie.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.529
<i>Which therapist?</i>

14:00.560 --> 14:03.803
The new one. Mr Spector,
the bereavement counsellor.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.081
How many times has he been in to see her?

14:09.240 --> 14:13.404
<i>Once...but a second appointment
is arranged for this afternoon.</i>

14:13.560 --> 14:15.801
- When?
<i>- Just over half an hour.</i>

14:16.760 --> 14:18.285
I'm On my way.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.808
Don’t allow Spector to see her
under any circumstances.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.281
<i>This is Paul Spector. Leave a message.</i>

14:29.440 --> 14:33.001
Oh, God, Paul, why is your phone always off?

14:33.160 --> 14:35.367
I need to speak to you.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.242
(Phone ringing)

14:56.560 --> 14:58.324
- Gibson.
<i>- Control, ma'am.</i>

14:58.480 --> 15:01.768
<i>We have surveillance at the hospital in place,
all entrances covered,</i>

15:01.920 --> 15:04.366
<i>and we'll let you know when anyone
has eyes on the target.</i>

15:04.520 --> 15:06.010
Very good.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.161
There's something I need you to do.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.809
(Camera clicking)

15:12.960 --> 15:16.601
X-ray 1. That's the target's wife
coming out of the house with the children.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.129
<i>Control. Can signs, stand by.</i>

15:20.280 --> 15:24.046
<i>From X-ray 1 . Target's wife

<i>Control Delia has.</i>

15:43.840 --> 15:45.842
- ls it looking OK?
- It is.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.606
But I'm going to have to ask you
to stop for the day'

15:49.560 --> 15:51.005
I haven't finished.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.208
We'll call to reschedule.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.922
Thank you.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.771
- Annie, I have to move you out of this room.
- Why?

16:16.920 --> 16:19.287
I don't have time to explain.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.006
From 8. That's the target crossing reception.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.968
Relax. It'll be OK.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.402
From 8. The target is ascending now.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.722
I repeat - ascending now.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.248
(Phone rings)

16:44.960 --> 16:47.361
<i>Ma'am, the target is ascending in the lift.</i>

16:47.520 --> 16:50.126
- OK.
- What's happening?

16:57.760 --> 17:00.081
- Please tell me what's going on.
- Shh.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.243
Mr Spector.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.482
PC Hagstrom. We met before.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.487
Oh, yes.

17:08.640 --> 17:12.361
I think you were due to have
another counselling session with Annie today.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.808
- Where is she?
- I'm afraid she's having some more treatment.

17:16.920 --> 17:21.528
- What sort of treatment?
- For her throat, I think. Her voice box.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.686
She didn't seem to have any trouble
with her voice when she was talking to me.

17:25.839 --> 17:28.810
When I first met her, she couldn't speak at all.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.963
When will I be able to see her again?

17:32.120 --> 17:34.009
I'm not sure.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.527
A hairdresser was booked to see Annie today.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.603
She's been cancelled, too.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.286
- By phone?
- Yeah.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.922
But you let me come all the way in here
before turning me away?

17:45.080 --> 17:47.811
We...tried your phone
but we couldn't get through.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.611
Actually, let me check.
What number do we have for you?

17:52.480 --> 17:54.482
It's OK.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.762
(Phone rings)

18:17.960 --> 18:19.803
- Yes?
- It's Control, ma'am.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.088
<i>The target's wife is approaching the hospital.</i>

18:22.240 --> 18:24.971
- She's coming here?
<i>- Entering by the main entrance, ma'am.</i>

18:25.120 --> 18:27.122
OK.

18:28.680 --> 18:32.401
(Whispers) I was due to see Mr Spector,
but is he the target?

18:35.120 --> 18:36.724
(Two knocks on door)

18:36.880 --> 18:38.882
It's Hagstrom. All clear.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.964
Right.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.120
Paul. Paul!

18:54.400 --> 18:57.529
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.443
- How did you know I'd be here?
- I opened a letter, addressed to you,

19:01.600 --> 19:04.206
- confirming your appointment.
- You're opening my letters?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.727
- Your phone's never on.
- H's broken.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.769
We need to talk, Paul.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.924
Olivia misses you. Liam needs a father.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.442
Paul?

19:23.280 --> 19:25.521
- Paul?
- OK.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.528
What?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.925
Let's...

19:31.760 --> 19:34.843
- Where are the kids?
- At a party.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.241
Have you got your car?

19:37.400 --> 19:39.243
OK. Let's go.

19:40.040 --> 19:43.601
<i>From 8. That's the target and wife
walking to the pedestrian exit.</i>

19:43.760 --> 19:45.967
<i>From 7. I have.</i>

19:46.120 --> 19:49.283
<i>- Control. Target and wife walking towards...</i>
- (Phone rings)

19:50.480 --> 19:52.403
- Gibson.
<i>- It's Ferrington.</i>

19:52.560 --> 19:56.087
- Responding to an emergency call, ma'am.
- Yes?

19:56.240 --> 19:59.005
A body has been found. A female-.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.370
- Where?
<i>- The Belfast Hills. Divis.</i>

20:03.520 --> 20:05.170
<i>In woodland.</i>

20:05.880 --> 20:08.406
<i>- Are you at the scene?
- On our way.</i>

20:09.640 --> 20:11.005
What else do we know?

20:11.160 --> 20:15.961
<i>The body's face-down, young -
late 20s, early 30s, possibly.</i>

20:16.120 --> 20:18.168
<i>Dark hair.</i>

20:18.320 --> 20:20.049
Cause of death?

20:20.200 --> 20:22.168
<i>There's talk of a ligature.</i>

20:22.320 --> 20:25.688
<i>The SIO at the scene
thought you should be informed, ma'am.</i>

20:31.760 --> 20:34.001
In any serious crime enquiry,

20:34.160 --> 20:39.007
there are always people who become
of interest to the investigation team'

20:39.160 --> 20:41.686
Most of them are eventually ruled out.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.802
One such person is your therapist.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.364
I really liked him.

20:48.520 --> 20:50.090
Tell me why.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.486
He made me feel better about myself.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.488
In what way "better"?

21:02.360 --> 21:04.681
I know it was only the once...

21:06.840 --> 21:09.320
"but he was the most helpful anyone's been.

21:10.680 --> 21:13.160
Why...do you think?

21:15.480 --> 21:17.562
He just seemed...

21:20.080 --> 21:22.401
He just listened.

21:23.440 --> 21:27.684
He was almost like a mirror.
He seemed to reflect me back somehow.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.162
He wasn't judgmental.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.724
I see.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.642
Annie...

21:45.160 --> 21:47.447
...you must not discuss this...

21:49.960 --> 21:51.962
...talk about him...

21:52.680 --> 21:54.682
...with anyone.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.682
Not family or friends.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.330
No-one.

22:01.440 --> 22:04.284
- You're scaring me.
- Don't be scared.

22:05.400 --> 22:09.450
We will protect you...properly from now on.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.090
Move you somewhere secure.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.482
Now I need to go.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.927
But I will be in touch very soon.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.762
My God.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.528
He was there. I remember him.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.009
GIBSON: <i>Where?</i>

22:38.160 --> 22:39.650
ANNIE: In the! bar.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.688
The night I lost my driver's licence.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.567
He's the man that attacked me.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.046
McNALLY: <i>We just want to ask you
a few questions.</i>

23:06.200 --> 23:07.565
About James?

23:07.720 --> 23:09.722
In part, about James.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.809
It's lovely here.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.291
I know.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.965
I can't believe it.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.761
I have the room at the top, at the front,
looking out at the sea.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.044
Does anyone else know I'm here?

23:27.200 --> 23:28.690
We're being very careful.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.602
He has people.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.042
People that watch out for him.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.768
He has eyes and ears.

23:40.320 --> 23:45.690
<i>From Bravo. Target and wife travelling south
on M1, heading towards Lisburn. Following.</i>

23:46.960 --> 23:49.406
<i>From Delta. I have reflective on car.</i>

23:49.560 --> 23:51.130
<i>Target's wife driving.</i>

23:51.280 --> 23:54.841
<i>From Control. Target and wife
travelling south on M1 towards Lisburn.</i>

23:55.000 --> 23:56.843
<i>- All call signs respond.
- (Ringing tone)</i>

23:57.000 --> 23:59.048
- Bums,
- We have him, Jim.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.248
- We have him.
- Where is he?

24:02.240 --> 24:04.049
Travelling in a car with his wife.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.965
<i>We mustn't Jose him, Stella,
under no circumstances.</i>

24:07.120 --> 24:11.011
<i>If we're letting him run in the hope
he leads us to Rose, we must not lose him.</i>

24:11.160 --> 24:13.367
They've found another body.
Have you heard?

24:13.520 --> 24:15.568
<i>- Female?</i>
- Yes.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.283
I'm on my way.

24:18.440 --> 24:23.446
And so it was Paul Spector who suggested you
call the police about your husband's behaviour?

24:24.480 --> 24:27.290
He said I had a right to feel safe
in my own home.

24:27.440 --> 24:28.726
I see.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.928
I told him I started it with James.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.762
I provoked him.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.642
But Paul said the fault
was always with the abuser.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.450
Not the abused.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.646
Did he put pressure on you to make that call?

24:44.320 --> 24:45.810
No.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.450
Not really.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.962
He called at your house unannounced?

24:51.120 --> 24:53.248
Just the once.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.650
Why would he do that?

24:58.520 --> 25:01.046
We'd missed some sessions.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.850
He was worried.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.921
What happened during that visit?

25:10.800 --> 25:12.529
We talked.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.410
I showed him my son's room.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.324
Why?

25:19.880 --> 25:21.928
At first...

25:22.600 --> 25:26.207
...after I lost Daniel,
I wasn't able to go in there.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.768
But then I did.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.562
I wanted Paul to see it.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.921
What happened in Daniel's bedroom?

25:39.480 --> 25:41.847
Was there physical contact between you?

25:44.520 --> 25:46.522
I asked him to hold me.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.245
Did he?

25:51.240 --> 25:53.004
Yes.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.729
Did anything happen
more than Paul Spector holding you?

26:00.800 --> 26:02.370
No.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.884
No.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.282
I wanted it to.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.602
But, no.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.323
- Have you seen her?
- No, ma'am.

26:38.160 --> 26:41.004
- They find the body?
- Yes, ma'am.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.770
Take me up to the scene.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.802
(Helicopter approaching}

27:13.440 --> 27:15.442
(Phone rings)

27:17.680 --> 27:19.045
- Gibson.
BURNS: <i>It's me.</i>

27:19.200 --> 27:21.441
<i>We have permission
to go into the Spector house.</i>

27:21.600 --> 27:24.285
<i>Intrusive surveillance.
Are you at the scene?</i>

27:24.440 --> 27:27.444
<i>- Is it Rose Stagg?</i>
- I don't know yet.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.807
<i>- Keep me informed.</i>
- Yes, sir.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.007
Who's been in there
apart from the first officers?

27:33.160 --> 27:35.891
The Force Medical Officer's been in
to confirm death.

27:36.720 --> 27:40.088
- Who's Senior Investigating Officer?
- He is, ma'am.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.167
I was told you were on your way, ma'am.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.684
DS Tom Anderson.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.080
I've ordered emergency lighting
and a scene tent.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.323
Can't see any tyre marks,
but we've established a common approach path

27:57.480 --> 28:02.646
that I think avoids the most likely entry/exit
routes used by the victim and/or the offender.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.924
- It was you who thought of my missing person?
- Yes, ma'am.

28:07.640 --> 28:10.007
What state of dress or undress is she in?

28:10.600 --> 28:12.284
She's dressed.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.247
- Tom Anderson?
- Yes, ma'am.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.682
(Motorcycle approaching)

28:34.160 --> 28:36.162
(Engine off)

28:49.600 --> 28:52.649
- Are you sure you're all right to do this?
- Yeah, I am.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.367
- Here's a suit for you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

29:30.160 --> 29:34.404
- [Camera clicking)
- Hair's the right colour...and length.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.931
Considerable lividity in her lower limbs.

29:43.840 --> 29:49.006
Rigor mortis has passed.
Probably more than 36 hours since she died.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.370
OK, let's turn her.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.726
Right. One, two, three.

30:05.640 --> 30:10.043
- Is it her? ls it Rose?
- I can't tell. There's too much blood.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.007
I don't think it is.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.402
Check her pockets.

30:16.560 --> 30:17.721
Wait.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.567
Rose had a difficult first delivery.

30:20.720 --> 30:23.405
She had a midline longitudinal Caesarean.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.326
- It's not her.
- Are you sure?

30:31.920 --> 30:33.922
It's not Rose.

30:46.120 --> 30:48.122
GIBSON: She was hanging.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.248
And the ligature gave way.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.484
Always look up at a crime scene.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.642
(Grunting)

31:13.000 --> 31:15.002
(Knocking)

31:27.960 --> 31:31.806
James Tyler?
DC Glen Martin. DC Gail McNally.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.688
Can we have a quick word?

31:40.160 --> 31:42.128
Is it OK I call you Jimmy?

31:43.120 --> 31:45.521
We just want to get your side of things.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.482
Get an account in your own words
of what happened

31:52.640 --> 31:55.211
the day after Paul Spector called here
to see Liz.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.689
- Have you spoken to Liz?
- We haven't.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.889
- Do you know where she is? Do you?
- Honestly, we have no idea.

32:03.360 --> 32:06.682
How did you find out Paul Spector
had been here? Did Liz tell you?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.162
- I heard.
- From...?

32:11.960 --> 32:13.883
Do you know who I am?

32:14.040 --> 32:16.088
Yes, I know who you are.

32:16.240 --> 32:19.449
Then you'll know I have friends...
that look out for me.

32:24.480 --> 32:27.370
- It's all yours.
- It's good to have met you.

32:28.360 --> 32:31.250
I uh...have a favour to ask.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.681
- Go ahead.
- Well, she's unidentified as yet.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.286
No next of kin to inform.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.967
Perhaps I can use her for 12 hours.

32:42.360 --> 32:43.964
Explain.

32:44.680 --> 32:47.650
- That man's not right.
- Why do you say that?

32:47.800 --> 32:51.088
I have a reputation
and the fucking wherewithal to back it up.

32:51.240 --> 32:56.485
That piece of shit faces up to me
in a fucking bath towel, not a flicker of fear?

32:56.640 --> 32:59.689
- Maybe you should sit down, Mr Tyler.
- Maybe you should suck this.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.571
- Jimmy, you're on police bail. Be sensible.
- Fuck you.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.769
So, by your own admission,
you attempted to intimidate Paul Spector,

33:05.920 --> 33:09.163
- threatened him with violence?
- He came here, to this house,

33:09.320 --> 33:10.924
when he knew I wasn't here.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.680
They went upstairs to look at my boy's room.

33:15.720 --> 33:18.121
For all I know, he fucked her on my boy's bed.

33:18.280 --> 33:21.648
My understanding is that the relationship
between Paul Spector and your wife

33:21.800 --> 33:23.086
was purely professional.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.890
So you have talked to Liz, then?

33:25.040 --> 33:26.485
- Huh?
- Take a step back.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.610
I've lost my boy.
I won't lose my wife, too.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.604
Doesn't she have some say in the matter?
She's not a possession.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.205
That's not helpful. Calm down, Jimmy.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.727
Especially not because of
that Jew boy piece of shit.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.531
Using threatening, violent words
is an arrestable offence.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.045
Then arrest me.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.328
Go on. Fucking try it.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.562
- Fucking arrest me!
- Step back, please.

33:45.720 --> 33:48.485
Get your fucking hands off me!
Get off me!

33:48.640 --> 33:51.644
- Get the fuck out of my house! Huh?
- Go. Go.

33:51.800 --> 33:54.406
Get out! Get the fuck out!

33:57.680 --> 33:59.284
- What was that?
- I was backing you up.

33:59.440 --> 34:02.603
You were treating me like a damsel in distress.
I don't need protection.

34:02.760 --> 34:05.047
- I can look after myself.
- Hit him with your handbag?

34:05.200 --> 34:08.248
Why don't you come join the rest of us
in the 21st century?

34:08.400 --> 34:10.482
I knuckle in. It's what I do - with any partner.

34:10.639 --> 34:13.085
Yeah? Well, in future, knuckle out.

34:13.239 --> 34:14.969
Fucking peelers!

34:24.199 --> 34:26.202
(Electric bell rings)

34:35.440 --> 34:37.568
What is it? ls it Rose?
Have you found her?

34:37.719 --> 34:40.451
No. But I do need to talk to you.

34:46.600 --> 34:49.683
- How many dolls do you have?
- 20 dolls.

34:49.840 --> 34:52.684
20 dolls. Wow, that's a lot.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.571
- Can you show me one?
- Yes.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.485
Do you want to go to your room
and get one? OK?

35:05.400 --> 35:07.004
It's easier with Cody.

35:08.320 --> 35:11.563
He's too young to appreciate
how worried I am.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.442
But with Nancy, it's uh...

35:17.080 --> 35:19.242
She just misses her mother.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.006
And I find it really hard lying to her.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.924
Yes.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.720
I have nothing new to report, Tom.

35:29.560 --> 35:33.121
But we are following
some very promising lines of enquiry.

35:35.320 --> 35:41.043
So, if you do see something on the news
that looks like it could be Rose...

35:41.720 --> 35:43.927
...rest assured that it isn't...

35:44.720 --> 35:46.529
...it isn't her.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.361
OK.

35:48.520 --> 35:53.651
It's an attempt to provoke the man
we believe is holding Rose into action.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.640
When we do find her,
you'll be the first to know.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.010
So you haven't given up hope?

36:01.160 --> 36:03.162
Good God, no.

36:04.040 --> 36:05.644
Never.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.368
Hey, you two, look who's here.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.566
Hello, darling.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.722
- Daddy!
- Hey.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.165
All right, stranger?

36:35.320 --> 36:39.644
From Bravo. That's the target and his wife
entering 217 Leftfield Road.

36:40.680 --> 36:42.523
Door closed.

37:15.680 --> 37:19.048
- Where are you now, Glen?
- I'm': with the Covert Operations Unit, ma'am.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.521
<i>Two minutes away from Spector's house.</i>

37:21.680 --> 37:25.002
He's with his wife and children in Lisburn.
That's 20 minutes away.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.161
<i>Right.</i>

37:26.320 --> 37:29.130
We have no idea
how long they're intending to stay.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.851
- Understood.
- I'll be with Control.

37:35.880 --> 37:39.407
From 1. That's the Technical Unit
arriving at the target's house.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.210
<i>Control. From X-ray 1.</i>

37:41.360 --> 37:44.807
<i>That's the Technical Unit
arriving at the target's house.</i>

37:45.520 --> 37:47.682
<i>Control to Bravo. Please update.</i>

37:48.840 --> 37:51.446
BRAVO: <i>From Bravo.
Target and family still in situ.</i>

37:51.600 --> 37:53.250
<i>217 Leftfield Road.</i>

37:54.200 --> 37:56.362
<i>Control to Bravo. Wait out.</i>

37:56.520 --> 37:58.010
BRAVO: <i>Copy.</i>

38:45.760 --> 38:47.410
How are we doing?

38:47.560 --> 38:50.086
Technical Unit has entered target's house.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.442
(Low chatter}

39:35.520 --> 39:37.841
<i>- How's that, ma'am?</i>
- That works.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.522
MAN: I'll take a power feed from the loft.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.602
(Camera whirs and clicks)

40:23.600 --> 40:25.602
(Timber creaking)

41:06.680 --> 41:10.765
<i>We can now go live to the scene
to hear from the police officer in charge.</i>

41:10.920 --> 41:13.651
<i>We can confirm that the body of a white woman</i>

41:13.800 --> 41:15.450
<i>in her late 20s, early 30s,</i>

41:15.600 --> 41:18.888
<i>was found earlier today
by a young couple out walking.</i>

41:19.040 --> 41:21.805
<i>We can offer no more information
until the remains have been identified.</i>

41:21.960 --> 41:24.566
<i>- Are you linking this death to...
- How long has she been dead?</i>

41:24.720 --> 41:26.085
<i>That's all I can say right now.</i>

41:26.240 --> 41:28.811
<i>If it's not Rose Stagg,
why was Superintendent Gibson here?</i>

41:28.960 --> 41:30.246
<i>That's all I can say right now.</i>

41:30.400 --> 41:34.121
<i>So no suggestion that the police
are treating the death as suspicious,</i>

41:34.280 --> 41:36.647
<i>- despite speculation...</i>
- (TV off)

41:37.760 --> 41:39.649
It's the original drawing, ma'am.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.406
That we lifted from the indentations
on the Ian Kay letter.

41:42.560 --> 41:45.689
We're there on
an intelligence-gathering mission.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.926
We don't have a warrant to search for evidence.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.364
Take pictures.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.082
(Footsteps clamping overhead)

42:06.040 --> 42:07.565
Aarghh!

42:09.040 --> 42:10.451
(He groans)

42:10.600 --> 42:12.602
(Coughing)

42:16.120 --> 42:18.691
- Stay still.
- Oh, fuck.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.884
What the fuck?

42:24.880 --> 42:26.882
Will we go home and get into our jammies?

42:27.040 --> 42:28.644
- All right, guys.
- See you, Steve.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.404
- See you.
- From Bravo.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.085
Target's family on the move.

42:32.240 --> 42:34.720
Leaving 217 Leftfield Road.

42:35.480 --> 42:38.643
<i>Control. From Bravo. Target on the move.</i>

42:38.800 --> 42:40.928
Bravo, Target approaching Volvo.

42:41.480 --> 42:44.290
<i>From Golf. Leaving from rear of Leftfield Road.</i>

42:46.640 --> 42:50.725
<i>Bravo. Vehicle heading south on Leftfield Road.
Family on board.</i>

42:50.880 --> 42:52.484
<i>From Golf. I have.</i>

42:52.640 --> 42:54.563
(Heavy breathing over monitor)

42:54.720 --> 42:56.404
<i>- We have a problem.</i>
- What?

42:56.560 --> 42:58.608
<i>- We've a collapsed ceiling.</i>
- What ceiling?

42:58.760 --> 43:01.081
<i>Above the main bedroom.</i>

43:01.240 --> 43:03.288
- How bad?
<i>- Destroyed.</i>

43:03.440 --> 43:04.726
Shit.

43:04.880 --> 43:07.645
<i>From Golf. Target's car joining the A1.</i>

43:07.800 --> 43:11.168
- Is there a water tank in the loft?
- Yes, ma'am.

43:11.320 --> 43:13.482
- Shit.
- Joining the A1, heading towards Belfast.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.211
Make it look like a flood. And get out.

43:16.360 --> 43:20.081
- The Spector's are heading home, ma'am.
- Shit. Fuck.

43:21.320 --> 43:24.403
DAISY: <i>What are you up to?</i>
- Fuck all.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.648
<i>Mr Big Dick not online?</i>

43:28.480 --> 43:30.881
Not yet. And don't call him that.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.929
<i>Why?</i>

43:33.080 --> 43:35.208
It's not about that.

43:35.920 --> 43:38.161
He means everything to me.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.564
What is that?

43:46.240 --> 43:48.402
Daddy, what's happening?

43:48.560 --> 43:50.005
Don't touch that.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.162
Stay outside. OK? Don't come in.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.322
(Footsteps sploshing)

45:06.600 --> 45:08.602
(Water stops running)

45:11.320 --> 45:13.971
SALLY ANN: Paul? What is it?

45:15.160 --> 45:17.731
- What's happened?
- (He rattles door handle)

45:24.560 --> 45:27.166
Come here, darling. Liam, come here.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.570
It's the main tank. It's flooded.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.290
Why? Why would the tank flood?

45:40.440 --> 45:43.171
- Must be a faulty stopcock.
- What about all my things?

45:43.320 --> 45:45.288
It's mainly our bedroom.

45:45.440 --> 45:48.887
- I want to see.
- You can't, darlin'. It's not safe.

45:49.040 --> 45:51.611
- What are we gonna do?
- You should go to your mum's.

45:51.760 --> 45:53.683
I don't want to go to Grandma's.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.842
I want to stay with you.

45:56.440 --> 45:59.887
- I'll gel onto the landlord. We'll gel it sorted.
- Oh, God, Paul.

46:00.040 --> 46:02.441
At least it's not unsanitary water.

46:02.600 --> 46:03.965
I'll son it. I promise.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.804
- (Camera clicking)
- From X-ray 1.

46:05.960 --> 46:08.566
Target and wife and children returning to car.

46:09.360 --> 46:11.681
It's gonna be all right. OK? I promise.

46:11.840 --> 46:13.729
Everything's gonna be all right.

46:13.880 --> 46:15.928
I'll see you again really soon.

46:17.560 --> 46:20.166
- We'll always be together.
- (Car door shuts)

46:20.840 --> 46:22.330
Come here.

46:42.880 --> 46:45.645
From X-ray 1. The target is not on board.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.802
The target not on board.

46:48.480 --> 46:51.165
<i>Control. From X-ray 1.
Target not on board.</i>

46:51.320 --> 46:53.368
<i>Repeat, target not on board.</i>

46:54.080 --> 46:56.686
Target's wife heading city-wards in Volvo.

46:57.480 --> 47:00.927
<i>From Control.
Target's wife heading city-wards in Volvo.</i>

47:01.960 --> 47:03.803
<i>From Golf. I have.</i>

47:04.720 --> 47:06.563
<i>Control. Golf has.</i>

47:07.560 --> 47:09.642
Target returning to house.

47:09.800 --> 47:12.041
<i>Control. Target returning to house.</i>

47:13.440 --> 47:14.930
Door closed.

47:32.400 --> 47:35.051
- Every possible exit is covered?
- Yes, ma'am.

47:35.200 --> 47:38.647
<i>- From X-ray 1. Target put to bed.</i>
- Right.

47:47.800 --> 47:50.531
Do you know a detective called Tom Anderson?

47:51.520 --> 47:53.010
Yeah.

47:53.760 --> 47:57.526
Detective Sergeant. West Belfast.
Young, charismatic.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.883
Good-looking.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.369
I met him at a crime scene.

48:04.520 --> 48:07.171
He was wearing a full forensic mask.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.204
What about him?

48:11.360 --> 48:14.728
I thought he might make
a useful addition to our team.

48:16.800 --> 48:18.290
I'll look into it.

48:19.720 --> 48:21.802
You do that.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.842
(Water dripping)

50:19.760 --> 50:21.762
(Buzzer)

50:23.440 --> 50:25.681
- Long day?
- Mm.

50:26.760 --> 50:29.286
Do we know anything more
about our Jane Doe?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.207
No external signs of a struggle.

50:33.560 --> 50:35.801
You're thinking suicide?

50:36.600 --> 50:40.161
There were some bruises
at the injection sites.

50:40.320 --> 50:44.564
I'll do an internal examination in the morning
when we get the toxicology reports.

50:45.880 --> 50:47.564
God.

50:48.600 --> 50:51.444
Why hang yourself
when an overdose will do, hm?

51:09.160 --> 51:11.003
So we think this is Spector?

51:11.160 --> 51:13.606
Yeah. Seems likely, sir. Yes.

51:16.120 --> 51:18.600
What a monumental cock-up.

51:23.320 --> 51:25.641
"PB. Aged 10."

51:36.000 --> 51:39.083
There's no suggestion these children
are at risk from their father-.

51:39.240 --> 51:42.164
We checked social services and their school.

51:42.320 --> 51:45.164
No cause for concern as far as anyone's aware.

51:46.480 --> 51:48.323
Nothing...

51:48.480 --> 51:50.369
must happen to those children.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.249
Above all else.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.762
(Computer bleeping)

52:15.200 --> 52:16.929
Why didn't you call earlier?

52:17.080 --> 52:18.923
<i>I've been busy.</i>

52:21.120 --> 52:23.043
<i>How are you?</i>

52:24.360 --> 52:27.523
<i>Where are you? is that your study?</i>

52:28.720 --> 52:30.563
<i>Have you moved back home?</i>

52:30.720 --> 52:33.610
No. I haven't moved back home.

52:38.240 --> 52:40.242
I've really missed you.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.644
<i>Have you?</i>

52:43.400 --> 52:45.767
I think about you all the time.

52:45.920 --> 52:48.446
Every minute of every day.

52:49.360 --> 52:52.011
- Is it painful?
- Yes.

52:52.160 --> 52:53.400
Good.

52:54.960 --> 52:56.610
Why good?

52:57.400 --> 53:00.927
Because other people's pain...
gives me pleasure.

53:01.680 --> 53:03.489
<i>Even mine?</i>

53:03.640 --> 53:05.881
Especially yours.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.802
Don't say that.

53:14.200 --> 53:16.407
Right. I'm gonna get changed.

53:17.320 --> 53:18.765
You look ready for sleep.

53:18.920 --> 53:20.763
Mm.

53:34.640 --> 53:37.041
<i>There's something I want you to do for me.</i>

53:37.200 --> 53:38.964
What?

53:39.680 --> 53:41.364
<i>I need you to go to my hotel room.</i>

53:42.280 --> 53:44.601
I just don't know how to get you in.

53:45.400 --> 53:47.402
- That's easy.
- Is it?

53:48.720 --> 53:50.484
I have a key.

53:50.640 --> 53:52.324
<i>How?</i>

53:52.480 --> 53:54.687
I got one cut.

53:56.920 --> 53:58.604
Why?

53:58.760 --> 54:00.922
<i>I don't know, I just did.</i>

54:03.360 --> 54:06.364
Then maybe you are ready to take the next step.

54:08.560 --> 54:10.369
More than ready.

54:12.200 --> 54:13.690
I don't mean that.

54:16.240 --> 54:18.049
Then what?

54:21.080 --> 54:23.526
Are you ready to embrace the darkness?

54:23.680 --> 54:25.887
I'd do anything for you.

54:26.560 --> 54:27.641
Look.

54:30.080 --> 54:32.401
I filled it out for all the murders.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.801
Saying you were with me every time-.

54:35.600 --> 54:36.965
I've researched it.

54:37.120 --> 54:39.168
It's really believable.

54:39.960 --> 54:41.803
There's a lot of sex.

54:42.480 --> 54:44.767
I told you already, it's not about sex.

54:44.920 --> 54:48.003
It's about deciding
the essential nature of the world-.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.970
Is the world a place of pain and suffering,

54:52.120 --> 54:54.646
of grief and despair...

54:54.800 --> 54:56.802
or is it a place full of joy...

54:57.760 --> 54:59.922
...all sweetness and light?

55:01.360 --> 55:03.522
- I don't know.
- Oh, I think you do.

55:04.880 --> 55:08.248
Your father was decapitated
in a motorcycle accident.

55:08.400 --> 55:10.562
<i>Or have you forgotten?</i>

55:10.720 --> 55:12.848
No, I haven't forgotten.

55:13.000 --> 55:17.847
It's OK.
My mother killed herself when I was seven.

55:18.720 --> 55:21.326
Left me alone and unwanted.

55:23.080 --> 55:25.287
There's suffering all around us.

55:27.240 --> 55:29.288
Why not take some pleasure from it?

55:32.080 --> 55:34.447
I don't know how to get pleasure from suffering.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.684
Yes, you do.

55:38.080 --> 55:40.128
Take your sexy friend, Daisy.

55:42.200 --> 55:44.282
You think she's sexy?

55:45.320 --> 55:48.563
<i>How would you feel if suddenly...</i>

55:48.720 --> 55:50.404
<i>she began to fail...</i>

55:51.640 --> 55:54.803
<i>...fail her exams...fail with boys?</i>

55:56.440 --> 55:58.727
<i>Or if she suddenly lost her good looks.</i>

56:00.360 --> 56:02.010
How?

56:02.160 --> 56:03.889
<i>She got fat.</i>

56:05.680 --> 56:08.570
Or a madman threw acid in her face.

56:08.720 --> 56:10.961
A random, motiveless attack.

56:13.200 --> 56:15.487
That would be too much.

56:15.640 --> 56:17.290
<i>Would it?</i>

56:17.440 --> 56:19.442
Why should she have it all?

56:20.560 --> 56:24.042
Why should she be the one that's clever,
and sexy and popular?

56:24.840 --> 56:28.242
Why should she be the one
with parents who adore her?

56:31.040 --> 56:33.088
<i>Happiness in others...</i>

56:33.240 --> 56:36.767
<i>is an affront to our own pain and misery, Katie.</i>

56:38.360 --> 56:41.125
<i>If other people's happiness pains us,</i>

56:41.760 --> 56:44.081
then why not reduce that happiness?

56:44.960 --> 56:48.885
Nurture your envy, Katie, your anger.

56:49.040 --> 56:50.804
It's the way forward.

56:54.520 --> 56:56.522
What is it you want me to do?

56:58.960 --> 57:00.644
<i>(Phone rings)</i>

57:01.600 --> 57:04.171
- Gibson.
<i>- It's Tom Anderson, ma'am.</i>

57:05.880 --> 57:08.690
Thank you for making
that statement to the press.

57:08.840 --> 57:10.842
<i>Did it help?</i>

57:11.600 --> 57:14.046
I'm not sure yet.

57:14.200 --> 57:17.647
<i>Well, I thought you should know
we've identified the victim from her prints.</i>

57:17.800 --> 57:21.168
<i>Marina McPherson.
A string of drug convictions.</i>

57:21.320 --> 57:23.800
<i>Strong indications she took her own life.</i>

57:25.920 --> 57:28.890
<i>Phone records show a number of phone calls
to a suicide helpline</i>

57:29.040 --> 57:31.122
<i>over the last six months or so.</i>

57:31.280 --> 57:33.009
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

57:33.160 --> 57:36.369
<i>There's a letter to her mother.
More or less a suicide note.</i>

57:36.520 --> 57:38.807
What did she say?

57:38.960 --> 57:41.042
<i>"I know you were home, Mum.</i>

57:41.200 --> 57:43.567
<i>You must have heard me ceiling you.</i>

57:43.720 --> 57:46.121
<i>Why didn't you answer the door?</i>

57:46.280 --> 57:48.965
<i>I know I've been bad
but I am still your daughter.</i>

57:49.680 --> 57:52.001
<i>I! you'd answered the door to me, who knows?</i>

57:52.160 --> 57:54.003
<i>But now it's too late.</i>

57:54.840 --> 57:56.842
I can't find my place in life.

57:57.560 --> 57:59.642
It's killing me inside."

58:04.400 --> 58:06.402
You there, ma'am?

58:07.920 --> 58:09.410
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

58:10.560 --> 58:12.642
Keep me posted.

58:13.560 --> 58:15.164
Good night.

58:20.960 --> 58:22.962
What on earth are you doing?

58:26.480 --> 58:28.528
Wondering where Rose is.

58:32.640 --> 58:42.640
