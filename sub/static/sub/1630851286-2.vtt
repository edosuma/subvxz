00:00.901 --> 00:02.636
Where you at Omar, come on,
Let's Go.

00:02.670 --> 00:03.804
[breathing heavily]

00:03.837 --> 00:05.005
Come on, hurry up.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.776
- [breathing heavily]
- Whew!

00:08.809 --> 00:11.445
Man it's like a slap in the
face, seein' that confederate
carvin'

00:12.213 --> 00:13.314
and them flags every time you
run up here, man.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.650
- Right. I think we should have
a petition signed online

00:16.684 --> 00:18.486
and have it replaced with
Outkast.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.154
[laughter]

00:20.188 --> 00:22.456
Yeah, you strugglin' back there,
man. You good, bro?

00:22.656 --> 00:24.258
I didn't get much sleep last
night.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.494
Oh, Casanova!

00:26.527 --> 00:28.329
- I see you play, boy.
- Ah uh, no, no, no.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.831
- Who is she?
- No, no, Greg. It ain't like
that, alright.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.866
I am genuinely tryin' to save my
marriage

00:32.900 --> 00:34.968
- Hey, I I respect that, okay.
- Okay.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.004
- I'm just sayin', this is a
no-judgment zone.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.140
So if you was gettin' your issue
last night,

00:39.173 --> 00:41.442
- you could tell your boy.
- [laughter]

00:41.775 --> 00:43.644
Bianca called me last night.

00:44.245 --> 00:44.812
What?!

00:45.179 --> 00:45.979
Yeah.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.350
But we only talked for a few
minutes. It wasn't much.

00:49.383 --> 00:53.020
Wait, so- so Bianca calls you in
the middle of the night and
y'all just

00:53.053 --> 00:54.688
what, trade cupcake recipes?

00:54.722 --> 00:57.024
- No, listen. She just told me
how hard it was bein'

00:57.057 --> 01:00.294
an immigrant and how she
actually hates that some
Dominicans

01:00.494 --> 01:01.529
don't think that they're Black.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.197
- Oh...that's cute.
- That's it.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.267
Y'all probably went back and
forth over who should hang up
first.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.535
What the hell is goin' on?

01:07.568 --> 01:10.304
Greg, I was up all night tryin'
to figure out how to tell Keith.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.006
Just tell him that Bianca
belongs to the streets!

01:13.040 --> 01:15.008
- [laughs]
- Matter of fact, I'll tell him.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.245
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. Don't tell him anything.

01:17.278 --> 01:20.047
Put your phone down. Now we both
know how he is.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.683
Every woman he likes, he thinks
she's his future wife.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.220
That is true.

01:28.322 --> 01:31.225
You better tell him quick,
before he gets hurt.

01:31.659 --> 01:32.860
- Let's go!
- [groans]

01:33.294 --> 01:36.297
- Hey, you always... Come.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.199
- cheat.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.436
* Strength in numbers

01:42.470 --> 01:44.272
* When you're under
I'm the one that you call

01:45.939 --> 01:48.108
* Six day ones,
ten toes down

01:48.542 --> 01:49.677
*I'm gonna rap
for my bras

01:51.111 --> 01:52.980
* You know if you gotta
think you got it wrong

01:53.013 --> 01:53.781
* You ain't gotta
ask no questions.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.518
Hey! [laughing]

01:57.851 --> 02:00.421
* [unintelligible]

02:02.022 --> 02:04.124
* if I'm my brother's keeper

02:16.770 --> 02:17.671
Good mornin', babe.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.173
- Aw, honey.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.608
That smells delicious.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.543
- [giggles] Thank you.

02:22.576 --> 02:26.380
Oh, remember um Kevin and Karen
are stopping by tonight for game
night.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.416
Oh, that's tonight?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.384
I got plans with the fellas.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.852
Can we reschedule?

02:31.885 --> 02:35.189
But, I would rather not cancel
on our friends, Darby.

02:35.223 --> 02:38.792
Your friends. [Laughs] You know
I don't have much in common with
Kevin.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.594
Sure you do.

02:40.961 --> 02:45.098
He loves basketball, and so do
you. Boom! [laughs]

02:45.132 --> 02:47.768
- Yeah, he thinks the greatest
player of all time is Larry
Bird.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.103
[paper crinkling]
- Well everyone is entitled to
their opinion.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.474
And personally, I think Tom
Brady is the best.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.576
[laughs] So--

02:55.609 --> 02:57.878
- Okay, I love the guys.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.947
Okay, I really do,

02:59.980 --> 03:03.317
it's just I think that it's time
we start hanging

03:03.351 --> 03:05.619
out with other couples,

03:05.653 --> 03:08.789
So you want me to ditch my boys
that I've known for over 20
years?

03:08.822 --> 03:11.492
- No, no, no. I'm not saying
that at all, um...
- [indistinct]

03:12.360 --> 03:17.998
I'm just saying that maybe
there's some space in your
friend circle

03:18.031 --> 03:20.368
for a little... diversity.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.336
- Diversity?
- Mm hm.

03:22.370 --> 03:26.440
Some professionals, maybe some
developers, you know just to
help

03:26.474 --> 03:28.108
with your business.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.911
Friends are not commodities that
you trade on the stock market,
Lisa!

03:30.944 --> 03:31.979
I know.

03:32.346 --> 03:36.450
Okay, but as your wife,

03:38.452 --> 03:43.991
it is my duty to look out for
your best interest, okay?

03:44.024 --> 03:45.293
Okay.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.265
Oh, and I need you to drink this
because

03:51.299 --> 03:53.100
I squeezed it special, just for
you.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.035
- You made it for me? Okay.
- Mm hm.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.538
- Mm hm... It's good, right.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.540
- [smacks lips] That's good.
[laughs]
- Mm hm.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.174
- That's good. That's good.
- [giggling]

04:01.208 --> 04:02.343
What's up, Bianca?

04:02.376 --> 04:04.745
It's a it's Keith. I hope you
slept well last night.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.382
Mm, you know I think I left my
chicken parmigiana in your
fridge last night, and

04:08.416 --> 04:11.051
forgot to take it out, so I hope
you haven't eaten it yet.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.220
Yeah, but I mean you can eat it
if you're hungry, that's

04:13.253 --> 04:14.688
nope, nope

04:14.722 --> 04:16.357
[deep exhale] Hola,

04:16.390 --> 04:19.192
Bianca. Soy me,

04:19.493 --> 04:21.595
Keith...Johnson.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.564
Okay...

04:23.597 --> 04:24.632
[Hip-hop theme]

04:24.665 --> 04:25.666
okay.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.771
[clapping]
- Yeah.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.773
[clapping continues]

04:33.006 --> 04:35.943
[sneakers squeaking]

04:36.610 --> 04:37.945
[exhales]

04:39.580 --> 04:42.816
Well look who decided to show
up? Only missed the entire first
half of the game.

04:42.850 --> 04:47.054
I sent you a text message askin'
what time it started but you
didn't reply.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.056
I didn't get it.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.224
Text message said you read it.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.261
Thought I turned that feature
off.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.764
So we raisin' the next LeBron?

04:57.931 --> 05:01.569
If LeBron's scorin' the opposing
team's basket in second grade,

05:01.602 --> 05:02.903
we right on track.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.071
He did that?

05:04.104 --> 05:05.539
- Twice.
- Oah.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.708
He's been on the bench ever
since.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.277
- Hey, that- that's not right.

05:14.281 --> 05:17.851
Hey coach, put number 5 in the
game. Come on, man. What are you

05:17.885 --> 05:18.619
doin'?

05:18.652 --> 05:19.753
Omar!

05:19.787 --> 05:23.056
- Dad, Dad, you're embarrassing
me.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.203
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.270
What you readin'?

05:37.304 --> 05:40.140
The Five Love Languages. You
wouldn't understand.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.042
How was your day off yesterday?

05:42.075 --> 05:45.546
- Ugh, Gregory is stayin' with
me for a while

05:45.579 --> 05:48.449
while he rents out his apartment
on an Airbnb.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.451
He cooked breakfast,

05:50.484 --> 05:53.220
and oiled my scalp.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.822
What? Girl,

05:54.855 --> 05:56.724
hook me up. He must have a
brotha.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.592
No, only a little sister.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.060
A cousin. Hell, his daddy?

06:00.093 --> 06:01.529
- You need to stop!

06:01.829 --> 06:03.497
You don't seem too happy.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.499
I'm...happy.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.402
Yeah well...I just feel like

06:08.436 --> 06:10.604
we've been stuck in the same
place for a while now.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.373
Girl, that's that biological
clock talkin'.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.243
No, I mean I see all of my
friends gettin' married.

06:16.276 --> 06:19.279
And having babies. I mean well,
except for you.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.915
I can always freeze my eggs,
okay.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.317
If I ain't got a man...he can't
cheat.

06:24.618 --> 06:25.753
[laughter]

06:25.786 --> 06:27.120
Rena,

06:27.154 --> 06:30.624
a man will take and use you for
as much as you let him.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.126
Okay? You gotta send him a
message

06:33.160 --> 06:34.895
that you not gonna put up with
it.

06:35.863 --> 06:36.864
Okay?

06:41.702 --> 06:42.936
[sneakers squeaking]

06:42.970 --> 06:47.808
[percussive hip-hop beat]

06:49.142 --> 06:50.578
[loud squeak]

06:51.411 --> 06:54.948
Hey coach, we're down by 40
points. Put number 5 in the
game.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.485
- Sit down. Stop cryin'!

06:58.852 --> 07:01.354
- Sh--?
- Mind your business. This has
nothin' to do with you.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.223
But everybody's got kids
playin'.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.459
It's not just about your son.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.960
[whistle blows]

07:06.994 --> 07:09.463
Hey, I didn't come all the way
down here to see my son sit on
the bench.

07:09.497 --> 07:10.698
Omar.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.366
I think that tight shirt is
cuttin' off your circulation.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.004
Maybe you wanna take it off and
give it back to your son.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.405
[laughter]

07:18.438 --> 07:19.707
[sneakers squeaking]

07:21.108 --> 07:23.143
Now I'm definitely not sittin'
down till my son gets in the
game.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.480
Well if he knew what basket to
put the ball in, he'd play more.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.482
Hey, don't you disrespect my son
like that.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.450
- Or what?
- Or what?

07:31.351 --> 07:32.953
Or... what?

07:33.420 --> 07:34.988
- Omar.
- I'm a show you what.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.357
- I'll show you what. That's
what. I'll show you what.
[ref blows whistle]

07:37.390 --> 07:39.426
- Keep disrespectin' my son,
man--
[whistle blows]

07:39.459 --> 07:40.494
keep disrespectin'--

07:40.528 --> 07:42.162
What the? What are you grabbin'
me for? Get

07:42.195 --> 07:43.597
get off a me. He started it.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.565
- Caleb!

07:45.633 --> 07:46.900
[clapping]

07:47.200 --> 07:48.902
Bye, Felicia.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.070
- It's alright.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.344
[laughter]
- Man, you gonna keep messin'
around with Jarvis,

07:57.377 --> 07:59.613
he's gonna come out of that suit
and tie, and he's gonna whoop
your ass.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.916
- Yeah, okay. Like gramps was
gonna knock you down them
bleachers, huh?

08:02.950 --> 08:05.519
Man, listen...I was not gonna
fight him.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.520
Mm.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.455
- I just wanted Caleb to know I
had his back.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.190
- Well you're lucky the police
ain't show up.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.892
That'd been all bad.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.126
You right.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.864
[sighs] But they made me leave,
and I didn't even get a chance
to talk to Caleb.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.732
Caleb knows, man. He
understands.

08:18.766 --> 08:22.102
little Nina in my bell,
holdin' bundles like my cousin
Mel

08:22.135 --> 08:24.204
Man, you gonna tell Keith about
Bianca?

08:24.237 --> 08:26.707
I've been tryin' to think of a
way to tell him without hurtin'
his feelin's.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.041
Oh, you mean lie?

08:28.075 --> 08:30.911
No, no. Not lie but--
[laughter]

08:30.944 --> 08:34.281
but I think the best thing we
can do for him is try to get his
mind off of it.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.949
That boy is in love.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.951
He can't see 5 feet in front of
him.

08:38.451 --> 08:39.386
Good luck with that.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.088
* I wish you would

08:44.658 --> 08:46.126
Hey! Oh...

08:46.426 --> 08:48.461
- Jarvis, my man.
- [giggling]

08:48.495 --> 08:51.298
- What is up, my brotha?
- Eeh..ah..yeah.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.100
- Kevin, Karen, good to see you
both.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.102
- You too!
- Good to see you too.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.304
- Oh, Karen!
- Hey!

08:57.337 --> 08:59.306
Hi, thank you guys so much for
coming.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.009
I brought potato salad. I hope
you like raisins.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.978
- Raisins?
- Oh...we love raisins!

09:05.012 --> 09:07.748
Thank you. I'll put it in the
kitchen with the rest of the
food.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.750
- Come on in. Yeah, come on.
Follow me.
- Alright.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.518
- Ah.
- Lookin' good, buddy.
- Mm.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.120
Yes.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.122
Here we go.

09:17.891 --> 09:18.759
You guys hungry?

09:18.792 --> 09:20.460
- Yes, we are.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.496
Oh great. Perfect timing.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.565
[exhale]

09:26.466 --> 09:29.436
I ran into your old college
sweetheart,

09:29.469 --> 09:31.004
- Mm hm.
- Donnie.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.206
Ah...hah

09:33.240 --> 09:35.943
Don't be jealous, Jarvis. This
was freshman year. long before
you two met.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.945
- Eh deh--
- Actually I hope you don't
mind, but...

09:37.978 --> 09:39.647
I invited him over.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.683
- [giggles]
- Oh my god, Karen...

09:42.716 --> 09:44.351
- ...no you didn't!
- Yes, I did.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.552
Who the hell is Donnie?

09:46.153 --> 09:48.321
Her Mexican lover...

09:48.355 --> 09:50.023
Don Julio!

09:50.057 --> 09:50.991
[laughter]

09:51.024 --> 09:53.627
Okay- okay, please don't' remind
me because I

09:53.661 --> 09:54.895
left that all behind me, okay.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.898
Ah, that look on your face was
priceless, Jarvis. Put it there!

09:58.531 --> 10:00.033
- Ah.
- Alright.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.201
[sigh]

10:01.434 --> 10:03.203
- Shots all around, hm?

10:03.236 --> 10:04.705
- To Don.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.707
- [Kevin] To Don.
- Mm hm.

10:07.507 --> 10:08.709
["Yellow" by Emi Secrest plays]
* How do two

10:08.742 --> 10:12.079
* hearts bump together

10:13.413 --> 10:18.518
* it's not a tale of black and
white

10:19.219 --> 10:23.891
* we keep our hands locked
together

10:24.892 --> 10:27.027
* we face each other--
- Hey, what's up, fellas?
- Hey!

10:27.060 --> 10:29.062
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up, Keith? What up,
brotha?

10:29.096 --> 10:30.664
Hey, sorry I'm late, fellas.

10:30.698 --> 10:33.333
Just had to wait for my mom's to
drop off my laundry, you know.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.503
Keith, please don't ever tell
anybody else that.

10:36.536 --> 10:38.271
Hey, where's Jarvis?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.440
He's hangin' out with his other
friends tonight.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.042
Oh, yeh you mean his wife?

10:42.075 --> 10:43.944
Yeah, I think that should be
allowed, Greg.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.079
It's okay. Greg's a little
jealous.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.514
Jealous? I'm not jealous.

10:47.547 --> 10:48.849
Yeah, you are jealous.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.851
- Hey, what's been goin' on with
you guys lately? I mean you were

10:50.884 --> 10:52.219
a little hard on him at the pool
hall.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.220
- [Omar] See?

10:53.253 --> 10:55.689
Jarvis needs to hear the truth
sometimes, okay?

10:55.723 --> 10:56.690
He's been trippin' lately.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.726
Your truth isn't Jarvis' truth,
Greg.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.796
Okay, I didn't know it was meet
up tonight to talk about Jarvis
all night.

11:02.830 --> 11:03.797
Is that what we doin'?

11:03.831 --> 11:06.366
- Oah...sensitive!
- Okay, this is sensitive.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.569
See you know what that is?
That's the face of a man who
knows he's done wrong.

11:09.602 --> 11:10.804
- Dead wrong.

11:10.838 --> 11:11.972
You're wrong, Greg, and you know
it.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.440
- Can I get you anything to
drink?

11:13.473 --> 11:15.042
Oh a yes, um

11:15.075 --> 11:18.578
may I please have a strawberry
daiquiri, por favor?

11:18.912 --> 11:20.580
Muchos gracias.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.582
[snickers] Comin' right up.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.854
- Yo.
- Did you see how she looked at
you?

11:27.788 --> 11:30.157
You mean a makin' eye contact
while takin' an

11:30.190 --> 11:31.959
order? That's pretty standard,
Greg.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.928
No, no, no, no. How she looked
at you before she walked away.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.731
- You need to shoot your shot,
okay. She is beautiful.
- Yes, yes.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.400
- Beautiful!...Way better.
- She is way better for you than
Bianca.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.969
Why are you copying us?

11:42.002 --> 11:44.271
- Alright...speaking of Bianca,

11:44.537 --> 11:49.176
Omar, did Bianca happen to
respond to your text the other
night?

11:49.209 --> 11:50.610
[smirks]

11:51.812 --> 11:53.346
- Yeah, Omar...

11:53.380 --> 11:54.281
did she?

11:54.314 --> 11:55.615
[laughs] You know what?

11:55.648 --> 11:58.485
I've been so busy, I haven't
even been able to check
Instagram.

11:58.786 --> 11:59.953
You can check now.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.454
Yeah, go ahead.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.825

12:16.870 --> 12:18.338
[laughter]

12:18.705 --> 12:21.441
Hey...you'll get 'em next time,

[clapping]

12:53.240 --> 12:54.174
- Come on, babe. Come on.
- Okay, you got this? Okay.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.275
Ah...

12:55.909 --> 12:56.877

12:56.910 --> 12:58.145

12:59.046 --> 13:01.014

- Holding.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.049
- Hold, warm.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.750
- Love!...Aaah!
- Yes!

13:03.783 --> 13:05.252
- Good job. [laughs]

13:05.518 --> 13:07.487
- Love Actually!
- No, 3 words.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.355
Honey, yeah.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.323
- Eat, Prey, Love?
- No, the first...

13:10.357 --> 13:12.325
okay, the first word is love.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.461
Um...okay,

13:15.095 --> 13:16.496
[feet shuffling]

13:16.529 --> 13:17.430
- Love and Basketball!
- Yes!

13:17.464 --> 13:18.932
- Yeah!
- [joyous screaming]

13:19.432 --> 13:21.301
[indistinct muffled cheering]

13:21.568 --> 13:22.903
I never heard of that.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.605
Oh, oh is it a documentary?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.775
So you never heard of Love and
Basketball?

13:29.376 --> 13:30.777
Oh is it a...

13:30.810 --> 13:32.379
Black movie?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.014
Yeah, it is.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.449
Jarvis introduced me to it and
it's really good. You should
watch it.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.919
Yeah, it's not really a Black
movie,

13:38.952 --> 13:40.520
right. It's got Black
characters.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.622
- That's- that's what I meant.
That's...
- Yes. Yeah.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.726
- So, Jarvis...

13:46.759 --> 13:48.828
how's the post-Covid market
treatin' ya?

13:49.096 --> 13:51.631
Well, it's a buyer's market for
sure.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.633
- Yeah, I mean it's been a
really weird

13:53.666 --> 13:56.937
time. I think um the last house
Jarvis sold

13:56.970 --> 13:59.006
was like 5 months ago, so

13:59.406 --> 14:01.008
- ...yeah.
- I mean

14:01.274 --> 14:02.609
everyone's been impacted.

14:02.642 --> 14:03.776
Of course.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.914
Well, [snickers] not everyone.
[Laughs]

14:06.947 --> 14:08.916
Covid was the best thing to
happen to us.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.284
My company owns a large amount
of stock in Zoom,

14:11.318 --> 14:12.352
so--

14:12.685 --> 14:14.821
Your dad's company, right?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.789
I became a partner 6 months ago.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.658
- Oh.
- Congrats.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.093
- Oh yeah.
- Oah.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.795
We're actually in the process of
expanding and a

14:22.829 --> 14:25.765
could a potentially use an agent
to help us with that.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.034
[clicks tongue]

14:27.367 --> 14:29.970
Of course you'd have to meet my
dad and get his approval.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.972
Maybe over a round of golf?

14:32.005 --> 14:34.407
I think that sounds like an
incredible

14:34.441 --> 14:35.808
opportunity, Jarvis.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.644
Don't you think?

14:38.345 --> 14:39.646
Don't you think?

14:41.148 --> 14:44.017
I guess I'll get that rematch.

14:44.051 --> 14:47.254
- Well boom shaka laka.
- [Karen] Yay!

14:47.287 --> 14:48.421
Alright, redemption.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.423
- Oh let's do it, baby, you got
it.
- My turn, ah--

14:50.457 --> 14:52.025
Look at me, kids- gross.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.027
- She did say--
- Say, say, say...
- Oh my god.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.028
- hey, say.
- My god.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.164
Hey fellas, where we goin' next?
I'm starvin'.

14:57.197 --> 15:00.867
Man, how about Club Crib-O,
okay? No entry fee.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.635
What? It's not even midnight.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.604
He does not wanna go back to
that hotel room.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.039
[laughter]

15:06.073 --> 15:07.374
Y'all wanna go to the strip
club?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.808
- I'm down.
- I'm sorry...

15:08.841 --> 15:11.945
how did you bein' hungry end up
at the strip club, Omar?

15:11.979 --> 15:13.046
They have a buffet.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.282
- I'm not eatin' no buffet at a
strip club!

15:15.315 --> 15:17.817
- Sorry.
- Alright. That's your loss
cause the food is bomb.

15:17.850 --> 15:18.785
- [laughter]
- Promise.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.653
Keith, are you good to drive?

15:20.687 --> 15:23.023
Am I-- hang on a second. [clears
throat]

15:23.056 --> 15:24.057
[keys rattling]

15:24.091 --> 15:25.392
- Do I need to talk about this?
- [laughter]

15:25.425 --> 15:26.759
[grunts]

15:27.894 --> 15:29.229
.02

15:29.262 --> 15:31.498
- My drinks is weak.
- Daiquiris usually are, bro.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.500
- Shut up. [laughs]

15:34.267 --> 15:35.502
[sighs]

15:36.436 --> 15:39.039
Bianca posted the photos I took
of her but

15:39.072 --> 15:41.041
she's not tagging me! I--

15:41.274 --> 15:43.310
Listen Keith, Bianca is clearly

15:43.343 --> 15:44.077
not the one for you.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.078
Look, I have an idea.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.579
Woa woa woa, Greg. No, no more
ideas from you.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.915
Hear me out, okay. He needs to
hear this.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.583
Man, you took the pictures,
Keith.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.985
- Yeah.
- You own the pictures.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.553
- Yeah.
- She didn't pay you for 'em.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.123
Just flag 'em, and they'll take
'em down.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.691
Hey that's, that's, that's
actually a good idea.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.561
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll do that.
Um

16:02.029 --> 16:03.330
I mean just as soon as I get
home, I'll--

16:03.363 --> 16:05.298
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no.
- No.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.935
Right here, okay. Right now. Get
it over with, Keith.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.603
Right now.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.306
Okay, fine. I'll do it now.

16:13.573 --> 16:17.044
But I mean let the record show
I'm just operating under duress,
okay?

16:17.077 --> 16:18.078
Whatever it takes.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.446
[phone buzzing]

16:19.479 --> 16:22.415
[faint music plays]

16:22.449 --> 16:23.283
[buzzing]

16:23.316 --> 16:24.784
Bianca's calling me.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.086
Are you serious?

16:26.119 --> 16:27.620
- Is she watchin' us?

16:27.920 --> 16:28.855
- Woa.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.623
- Alright, so um...

16:31.424 --> 16:32.359
- I'm gonna take this.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.260
- No, no, no, no
- Woa.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.561
I will see you guys...soon.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.928
- No, no.
- No, no, no, Keith--

16:35.962 --> 16:37.364
- I have to. Have to. I'm weak.
- No, no.
- No, no, no, don't--

16:37.397 --> 16:39.332
- I'm weak!
- Don't take it. Don't--

16:41.668 --> 16:43.770
Bianca, hey. What's up? How you
doin'?

16:43.803 --> 16:44.737
Strip club?

16:44.971 --> 16:45.972
- Let's go.
- Cool.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.507
Hey, Keith...

16:48.007 --> 16:50.310
I'm so sorry I'm just now
getting back to you.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.744
I've just been so busy.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.581
Oh yeah, yeah. Me too. A super
busy. Actually you know, I just
finished

16:54.614 --> 16:55.482
work really, so--

16:55.515 --> 16:56.983
You're such a hustler
[latin music]

16:57.016 --> 16:58.985
Or entrepreneur, you know

16:59.018 --> 17:00.487
tom-ayto/tom-ato.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.790
Hey look so I'm sorry I ate your
chicken parmigiana.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.326
Ah well, you know I kind of
figured you would.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.660
Are you calling me fat?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.329
What? No, no!

17:09.362 --> 17:10.830
What? Wait, why would you get
that from--

17:10.863 --> 17:13.066
I'm just joking, Keith! [laughs]

17:13.100 --> 17:16.002
Oh, [laughs] yeah. Yeah.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.670
I mean I knew that.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.406
So, a couple of nights a week
[Spanish singing begins]

17:19.439 --> 17:21.674
I come to Loca Luna for salsa
night.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.842
You should come next time.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.977
I love salsa. I...

17:25.512 --> 17:27.114
put it in my guacamole.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.116
[laughs] You are so silly.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.118
I'll see you Wednesday at 9:00?

17:31.151 --> 17:32.552
I wouldn't miss it.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.787
I mean unless the world ends?

17:34.821 --> 17:36.823
But in that case you know,
you're missin' it too, right?

17:36.856 --> 17:38.858
[laughs] cause you know, we're
both

17:38.891 --> 17:39.826
dead.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.828

17:46.699 --> 17:48.201
Tonight was fun, right honey?

17:48.235 --> 17:49.469
Which part?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.938
When you told Kevin I couldn't
make a sale or

17:51.971 --> 17:54.141
when he felt the need to make me
a charity case?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.776
Jarvis, what are you talking
about?

17:56.809 --> 17:58.878
Like, Kevin is a friend and he's

17:58.911 --> 18:00.347
just trying to help.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.350
- [sighs] Well...

18:03.383 --> 18:05.885
it's just the whole night was a
setup for me to pitch myself to
Kevin's dad.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.721
No, Kevin's offer is genuine.
Look,

18:09.356 --> 18:11.023
why have a chip on your
shoulder?

18:11.324 --> 18:12.559
Kevin can just be a little

18:12.592 --> 18:15.061
- ...competitive sometimes,
that's all.
- Mm hm.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.196
You know

18:16.696 --> 18:18.231
I appreciate your help.

18:18.731 --> 18:19.832
- Alright?
- Mm hm.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.034
But I got a lot of showings next
week.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.736
I'm gonna get things back on
track.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.872
- I know you will. Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:25.905 --> 18:29.376
It's just you know this is just
a good opportunity

18:29.409 --> 18:31.344
for you to grow and expand,

18:31.378 --> 18:35.215
- Will you just hear him out for
me...please?
- [sighs]

18:35.515 --> 18:36.916
- For you.
- Okay.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.718
- For you.
- Thank you.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.153
Alright, thank you.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.087
- For you. Only for you.
- [giggles] Yes, for me!

- I'm serious, man.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.264
Look they'll talk your problems
and your money away.

see how brown it is on both
sides, man?

Ah actually I just came here to

Um...matter of fact,

19:07.280 --> 19:09.616
can you tell me if they're
bringin' some more french toast
out?

19:09.649 --> 19:11.083
And some butter for these grits?

happened.

it's cold outside.
