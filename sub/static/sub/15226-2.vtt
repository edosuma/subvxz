01:27.219 --> 01:28.653
Guess what!

01:28.688 --> 01:30.955
Elaine Nardo is going to Europe!

01:30.989 --> 01:32.390
How can she do that?

01:32.424 --> 01:34.959
Because her ex-husband just
   showed up out of the blue

01:34.994 --> 01:36.694
and took her kids
        for four weeks,

01:36.728 --> 01:38.296
leaving her free as a bird!

01:38.330 --> 01:40.065
All right! Let's give
         her a going-away party.

01:40.099 --> 01:41.399
Yes!
                         ELAINE:
                           Okay.

01:41.433 --> 01:42.800
No!

01:42.835 --> 01:46.871
If Elaine Nardo doesn't care
 enough to tell us personally,

01:46.905 --> 01:48.540
then to hell with her.

01:50.375 --> 01:53.111
Elaine, I didn't know you were
   planning to go to Europe.

01:53.145 --> 01:54.112
No, I haven't been.

01:54.146 --> 01:55.713
That's what so great about this.

01:55.747 --> 01:58.683
But when Vince showed up
and took those kids, I thought,

01:58.717 --> 02:01.853
why not see some of this planet
        before you die?

02:01.887 --> 02:03.988
Go to Europe!

02:04.022 --> 02:05.857
Look, I am so
               excited about it,

02:05.892 --> 02:07.558
I cannot stand it.

02:07.593 --> 02:10.228
Well, I think it's great to be
so spontaneous and off-the-cuff,

02:10.262 --> 02:12.130
but don't you have to
     think about it first?

02:12.164 --> 02:13.831
It's off season
                      and cheap.

02:13.865 --> 02:16.034
Why don't you come with me?

02:16.068 --> 02:17.635
Me? No, I can't do that.
                            Yes!

02:17.669 --> 02:18.836
No.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.104
I can.

02:23.008 --> 02:26.278
Please don't take this
     the wrong way, Nardo.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.646
I want to show you Rome.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.682
I want you to see
       the Sistine Chapel

02:31.717 --> 02:33.584
just the way
     Michaelangelo saw it.

02:33.618 --> 02:34.685
(grunts)

02:38.757 --> 02:41.759
Come on, Alex,
    I'm serious about this.

02:41.793 --> 02:43.628
I know you've always
         wanted to go to Europe.

02:43.662 --> 02:45.029
So, why not now?

02:45.063 --> 02:46.530
Come on, aren't you the one

02:46.565 --> 02:48.132
who's always saying
                 how great it is

02:48.166 --> 02:50.168
that we can just pick up
    and go when we want to?

02:50.202 --> 02:51.903
Look, Elaine, just forget
about it, I can't do it.

02:51.937 --> 02:53.170
Never mind why.

02:53.205 --> 02:55.840
Don't ask me, please.
Just leave me alone.

02:55.875 --> 02:58.109
Alex, come on, now.

02:58.143 --> 02:59.811
This is me you're talking to.

02:59.845 --> 03:02.847
Why don't you just
             tell me the reason?

03:02.881 --> 03:05.350
(chuckling):
Okay.

03:05.384 --> 03:07.285
But you know the reason.

03:07.319 --> 03:08.386
No, I don't.

03:08.420 --> 03:09.621
Elaine,

03:09.655 --> 03:13.425
it has been our history
that there has been

03:13.459 --> 03:15.826
a certain attraction
between you and me here.

03:15.861 --> 03:17.362
Especially you for me.

03:17.396 --> 03:20.599
Oh... you're being silly.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.167
Look, it's every
decent man's fantasy

03:23.201 --> 03:25.737
that Europe is filled
with steamy, sultry women

03:25.771 --> 03:27.371
just waiting to throw themselves

03:27.406 --> 03:29.841
at the feet
of some American stud.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.346
Okay, Alex, you're going to miss

03:35.381 --> 03:37.849
what could be the best time

03:37.883 --> 03:40.718
of your suspicious,
           fearful, little life.

03:40.752 --> 03:42.487
You could go off
                   with Monique,

03:42.521 --> 03:44.355
whenever you want to.

03:44.389 --> 03:46.457
And I'll go off with Aldo.

03:47.426 --> 03:49.360
Alex, we will have

03:49.394 --> 03:51.930
the security of
               a friend with us.

03:51.964 --> 03:53.798
That's why it'll
            always be wonderful.

03:53.832 --> 03:58.236
It'll be open but protective.

03:58.270 --> 04:01.606
Adventuresome but familiar.

04:01.640 --> 04:05.410
The perfect vacation.

04:07.313 --> 04:09.447
It has been the lesson
of my life that nothing

04:09.482 --> 04:12.450
that ever sounds that good
ever really happens.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.152
Isn't it worth the chance?

04:15.754 --> 04:17.822
Wait, wait a minute,
                  wait a minute.

04:17.856 --> 04:19.324
Let me get this straight.

04:19.358 --> 04:21.125
Now, you're saying that

04:21.160 --> 04:22.794
if I met someone
              right off the bat,

04:22.828 --> 04:24.929
and I just went off
                 and left you...

04:24.963 --> 04:27.565
Fine.

04:27.599 --> 04:30.702
(chuckling)

04:30.736 --> 04:32.837
You mean, if you had
        something to do one day,

04:32.872 --> 04:34.672
and you wanted to do it
        with me and I just said,

04:34.707 --> 04:36.441
"Sorry, there's someplace
           else I'd like to be,"

04:36.475 --> 04:37.842
you wouldn't look hurt?

04:37.876 --> 04:40.145
Absolutely not.

04:42.181 --> 04:43.448
(scoffs)

04:44.950 --> 04:46.384
All right, wait a minute,
what if,

04:46.419 --> 04:48.553
what if I met someone
in an Alfa Romeo,

04:48.587 --> 04:51.055
and I said, uh, "I'm sorry,

04:51.089 --> 04:52.990
but I'll catch up
with you in Rome, Elaine."

04:53.025 --> 04:54.826
I'll see you in Rome.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.864
Sounds good, but, uh,

04:59.898 --> 05:02.534
I'm still not sure
I should do it.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.737
Who didn't clean the puke
        out of cab 415?

05:08.040 --> 05:09.507
And yet...

05:09.541 --> 05:11.242
(jet engine roaring)

05:21.487 --> 05:23.454
How's the French
coming along?

05:23.489 --> 05:25.122
Just fine.

05:25.157 --> 05:26.857
Answer me in French.

05:26.892 --> 05:28.226
(with French accent):
                 Just fine.

05:28.260 --> 05:31.028
(laughing)

05:37.569 --> 05:40.971
Oh, she's very pretty, huh?

05:41.006 --> 05:43.641
Yeah, only in a sort
                of stunning way.

05:45.444 --> 05:47.112
You know, I think she's alone.

05:47.146 --> 05:48.747
Why don't you go
say hello to her?

05:48.781 --> 05:51.682
I'm thinking about it,
          I'm thinking about it.

05:51.717 --> 05:53.484
She just glanced over here.

05:53.518 --> 05:55.787
Come on, Alex, you're
on your way to Europe,

05:55.821 --> 05:58.156
so get on your way.
                  Please, you're
                embarrassing me.

05:58.190 --> 06:00.225
I'm not going to walk
            over and talk to her

06:00.259 --> 06:01.692
while I'm sitting
            here talking to you.

06:01.727 --> 06:04.295
Alex, isn't this
what our pact is about?

06:04.329 --> 06:06.731
Come on, if you want
to go say hello to her,

06:06.765 --> 06:08.566
you go say hello.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.201
Okay...

06:13.972 --> 06:15.907
You know, Elaine,
       it's really great

06:15.941 --> 06:17.208
traveling with you, I mean that.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.649
(clears throat)
           Excuse me.

06:24.683 --> 06:27.318
The, uh, walk over here

06:27.352 --> 06:28.852
was the longest
        walk of my life,

06:28.887 --> 06:31.622
but the walk back is going to be
even longer if you don't smile.

06:31.656 --> 06:34.392
Get lost.

06:40.966 --> 06:43.301
Let's just forget that it
  didn't work out right away.

06:43.335 --> 06:45.770
Uh, I'm in a kind of funny
     social position here,

06:45.804 --> 06:48.673
and I'd, I'd be very obligated
    to you as a human being

06:48.707 --> 06:49.907
if you'd just let me
        sit next to you

06:49.941 --> 06:51.075
for just a couple of seconds.

06:51.109 --> 06:53.411
If I have to mace you, I will.

06:53.445 --> 06:56.247
(chuckling):
That's not mace, that's Binaca.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.223
Even Binaca, when you get it
   in your eye, still stings.

07:09.895 --> 07:11.229
Alex, how'd it go?

07:11.263 --> 07:14.699
Oh, it's a little
              too early to tell.

07:14.733 --> 07:16.667
Todd Bentley,
this is Alex Reiger.

07:16.701 --> 07:17.869
Hi, Todd.

07:17.903 --> 07:19.337
How do you do there,
                Mr. Reiger, sir?

07:19.371 --> 07:20.839
Huh, please,
      don't call me "sir."

07:20.873 --> 07:22.740
I'm sorry, Mr. Reiger.

07:22.774 --> 07:24.642
Would you not
     call me "Mr. Reiger"?

07:24.676 --> 07:27.078
What's the difference in our
ages anyway, six or seven years?

07:27.112 --> 07:28.847
I'd say more like 12, sir.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.649
All right, so I'm the
        oldest guy on the plane.

07:31.683 --> 07:33.817
Are you satisfied now?

07:33.852 --> 07:36.420
Is he
           bothering you now?

07:38.724 --> 07:40.491
Is this your Rubik's Cube?

07:40.525 --> 07:42.627
Yes, it's my
                   Rubik's Cube.

07:42.661 --> 07:44.529
Alex, calm down.

07:44.563 --> 07:47.865
Uh, Todd has just asked us
to jog to Germany.

07:47.899 --> 07:49.066
Oh, good.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.501
Why don't you just run on ahead?

07:50.569 --> 07:51.769
We'll catch up later.

07:52.738 --> 07:53.838
Todd, I heard you

07:53.872 --> 07:55.773
playing your guitar
in the boarding area.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.008
You played so well.

08:26.604 --> 08:29.206
ALEX:
      <i>We could have walked</i>
     <i>and saved the bus fare.</i>

08:29.241 --> 08:31.209
ELAINE:
     <i>Alex, we're in Europe.</i>

08:31.243 --> 08:33.510
ALEX:
       <i>Every penny counts.</i>

08:41.720 --> 08:43.554
"The Queen and the
Duke of Edinburgh

08:43.589 --> 08:45.456
in front of
Buckingham Palace."

08:45.491 --> 08:47.958
Right, right, I got it.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.295
"A nice couple
we met at the hotel."

08:51.330 --> 08:52.530
(laughing):
                             Oh.

08:52.564 --> 08:54.898
Oh, I got it, I got it.

08:54.933 --> 08:57.901
Hmm, arrows pointing
                    to our room.

08:57.936 --> 08:59.103
Oh, nice touch.

08:59.137 --> 09:00.137
(both laugh)

09:00.172 --> 09:02.539
This is fun.

09:02.574 --> 09:04.508
Hey, Alex, why don't
               we meet every day

09:04.542 --> 09:06.410
for postcard writing,
         you know, like at 5:00?

09:06.445 --> 09:08.446
And that way, no matter where
     we are or what we're doing,

09:08.480 --> 09:09.981
we'll have some time together.

09:10.015 --> 09:12.149
Oh, I don't know, Elaine,
         I don't know.

09:12.183 --> 09:13.885
Better not count on that.
                             Oh.

09:13.919 --> 09:16.220
I mean, I don't want
   to get us both tied down.

09:16.254 --> 09:18.856
And there's this Julie Christie
 look-alike I've had my eye on.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.324
Oh, great.

09:20.358 --> 09:22.059
Well, make it if you can.

09:22.093 --> 09:24.061
My goodness,
                 you look great!

09:24.095 --> 09:26.263
Oh, James, hi.

09:26.297 --> 09:28.065
James, this is Alex.

09:28.099 --> 09:30.868
Ah, Alex,
   Elaine's platonic friend.

09:30.902 --> 09:33.070
Hi.

09:33.104 --> 09:34.939
Have you, uh, met any of those,

09:34.973 --> 09:36.941
um, steamy, sultry women yet?

09:36.975 --> 09:40.378
Ah, the butt of private jokes,
             I see.

09:40.412 --> 09:43.047
Look, um, excuse us,
        but Elaine and I

09:43.081 --> 09:45.282
really must be pushing off.
                  Oh, yes, okay.

09:45.317 --> 09:46.751
I'll see you tomorrow?

09:46.785 --> 09:48.953
Cheerio.
                        Bye-bye.

09:50.055 --> 09:52.356
Wait, James.
                      All right.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.825
Alex?

09:54.860 --> 09:57.294
You do have something to
          do tonight, don't you?

09:57.329 --> 09:58.896
Why? Here in London?

09:58.931 --> 10:00.598
I hardly know
where to start.

10:00.632 --> 10:01.866
(chuckling):
              Oh.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.501
You're welcome to come
     with us if you'd like.

10:03.535 --> 10:07.104
(laughing):
         On your date?

10:07.138 --> 10:09.006
Where are you going?

10:09.040 --> 10:13.210
We're taking a moonlight
    boat ride up the Thames.

10:13.244 --> 10:15.380
Well, all right, but tell me
      if I get in the way.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.882
No, no, no, it's all right,
it's all right. You go ahead.

10:17.916 --> 10:19.583
And thanks for asking.

10:19.617 --> 10:21.052
There's a lot here
I can do on my own.
                        Okay.

10:21.086 --> 10:22.787
Maybe even pick up
a wench or two.

10:22.821 --> 10:23.887
Ooh!

10:23.922 --> 10:25.623
Break some hearts, you rogue.

10:25.657 --> 10:28.125
(with English accent):
         You've got it.
                            Bye.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.266
Ha!

10:36.201 --> 10:38.135
Do you mind?

10:39.137 --> 10:40.404
Thanks.

10:51.149 --> 10:52.917
Watch this.

10:55.854 --> 10:57.555
Oh!

10:59.991 --> 11:03.527
Oh, excuse me,
                      excuse me.

11:03.561 --> 11:05.462
I'm terribly sorry.

11:05.497 --> 11:09.300
Terribly sorry.

11:09.334 --> 11:11.035
I'm really very sorry.

11:11.069 --> 11:12.069
God...

11:14.639 --> 11:16.574
(Greek music playing)

11:28.119 --> 11:29.086
WOMAN:
          ¶ La la la

11:29.121 --> 11:31.389
MEN:
         <i>Opa! Yasu! Opa!</i>

11:31.423 --> 11:34.058
¶ <i>Yasu,</i> la la la,
           la la la ¶

11:34.092 --> 11:37.828
<i>Opa! Yasu!</i>

11:37.862 --> 11:39.597
(woman singing in Greek)

11:39.631 --> 11:41.199
<i>Opa! Yasu! Opa!</i>

11:42.867 --> 11:44.001
Ow!

11:44.736 --> 11:47.672
(singing in Greek)

11:47.706 --> 11:49.673
<i>Opa!</i>
 <i>Yasu!</i>

11:49.707 --> 11:51.108
<i>Opa!</i>
                           <i>Yasu!</i>

11:51.142 --> 11:53.043
<i>Opa!</i>
                           <i>Yasu!</i>

11:53.077 --> 11:56.046
Oh!
           <i>Yasu! Yasu!</i>

11:56.080 --> 11:57.214
<i>Yasu!</i>

11:57.248 --> 11:58.248
<i>Opa!</i>

11:58.282 --> 11:59.884
<i>Opa!</i>

11:59.918 --> 12:02.453
(all whooping and laughing)

12:02.487 --> 12:03.721
(groans)

12:06.691 --> 12:07.991
ELAINE:
Whoo!
          Elaine, Elaine,

12:08.026 --> 12:10.027
what made us think
     that it would be good

12:10.061 --> 12:12.597
to be here when the fisherman
     came in with the fish?

12:12.631 --> 12:15.399
Oh, Alex, this place
                 has atmosphere.

12:15.433 --> 12:17.101
Unfortunately,
     it may not wash out of

12:17.135 --> 12:18.135
our clothes.

12:18.169 --> 12:19.303
(laughs)

12:19.337 --> 12:20.704
The smell
offends you?

12:20.739 --> 12:22.206
(laughs)

12:22.241 --> 12:24.942
Ah, I love
the smell.

12:24.976 --> 12:26.243
Ooh!

12:26.277 --> 12:29.213
It's the smell of life.

12:29.247 --> 12:30.380
Fish...

12:30.415 --> 12:31.916
and friendship.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.686
And who's contributing what?

12:35.720 --> 12:37.088
Who cares?

12:37.122 --> 12:38.789
That's the
                   beauty of it.

12:38.823 --> 12:40.591
Oh, look at this,
Elaine, Elaine.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.860
"The ruins of the temple
of Apollo."

12:42.895 --> 12:43.961
(dry chuckle)

12:43.995 --> 12:47.064
"We didn't do this."

12:47.098 --> 12:49.233
(laughs)
                        (laughs)

12:49.267 --> 12:51.335
Alexo, you must
                     be a Greek.

12:51.370 --> 12:55.072
Because a Greek, uh,
       cherishes above all life,

12:55.107 --> 12:57.908
friendship
                   and laughter.

12:57.942 --> 12:59.777
(laughs)

12:59.811 --> 13:00.811
(laughs)

13:00.845 --> 13:02.079
I love this man!

13:02.114 --> 13:03.080
No. Hold on.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.082
I love this man!

13:05.117 --> 13:06.684
Mwa!

13:06.718 --> 13:07.852
Ah, we-we need...

13:07.886 --> 13:10.087
We need
                 more-more ouzo.

13:10.121 --> 13:11.655
Huh?
            Oh, yes.
           Yes, yes.

13:11.689 --> 13:13.023
Please.
            (speaking Greek)

13:13.058 --> 13:15.092
I'll, I'll bring
                 more ouzo, huh?

13:15.126 --> 13:17.228
Okay.
                    Mwa!
(laughing)

13:20.131 --> 13:23.067
Elaine, I like Oumas,
 but he isn't really your type.

13:23.101 --> 13:25.603
Oh, Alexo, to us Greeks,

13:25.637 --> 13:27.605
there is no type.

13:27.639 --> 13:31.308
Only the sea and love,
and love of the sea.

13:31.342 --> 13:32.610
(both laughing)

13:32.644 --> 13:35.278
Okay, one postcard,
and then I have to go, okay?

13:35.313 --> 13:37.180
Wait. You can't.

13:37.215 --> 13:39.250
This is our postcard time.

13:39.284 --> 13:41.552
We agreed to write postcards
      together every day.

13:41.586 --> 13:44.155
Alex, we agreed to write
postcards every day if we could.

13:44.189 --> 13:45.923
So far, we haven't missed a day.

13:45.957 --> 13:48.025
Yeah, but you've been
   cutting down on the time.

13:48.059 --> 13:50.661
And today, you were late,
     and you brought Oumas.

13:50.695 --> 13:52.463
Okay, all right,
   I can stay a while longer.

13:52.497 --> 13:53.864
No, no, I mean,

13:53.898 --> 13:56.000
am I wrong? I mean, just tell me
        if I'm wrong...

13:56.034 --> 13:57.602
ELAINE:
It's okay.

13:57.636 --> 13:59.370
(mutters)
What's
the matter?

13:59.404 --> 14:03.875
Elaine, there's this, uh,
beautiful girl that I met, and,

14:03.909 --> 14:05.776
uh, I told her
  to meet me here, and, uh...

14:05.810 --> 14:06.944
Oh.
         She's a model
          from Paris.

14:06.978 --> 14:08.612
I didn't even know
       she would show up.

14:10.815 --> 14:13.684
Yo! Yo! Desiree!

14:13.718 --> 14:15.319
I'm in here.
          I'm in here.

14:15.353 --> 14:16.687
She's coming.

14:16.721 --> 14:17.954
She's coming in.

14:17.989 --> 14:19.823
Elaine, excuse me. My date
 is shimmering in the doorway.

14:22.293 --> 14:24.495
ALEX:
                        Desiree.

14:24.529 --> 14:25.996
(Alex laughs)

14:26.030 --> 14:28.532
You look
                         lovely.

14:28.566 --> 14:30.334
Elaine Nardo,
                this is Desiree.

14:30.368 --> 14:32.303
Hello.
Hello.
How do you do?

14:32.337 --> 14:34.171
Uh, I really
must be going.

14:34.205 --> 14:37.408
Um, Oumas promised to dive into
the Aegean and get me a sponge.

14:37.442 --> 14:38.642
Funny.

14:38.676 --> 14:40.645
Uh, I'll see you later.

14:40.679 --> 14:41.879
Sure.

14:41.913 --> 14:43.114
Why? You
                     want to go?

14:43.148 --> 14:44.949
No, no, no,
           let's go.
                     Okay, okay.

14:44.983 --> 14:46.517
Come, I'll show you
Athens by night.

14:46.551 --> 14:47.818
ELAINE:
          Good night.

14:47.853 --> 14:48.986
Have fun,
            you two.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.154
ALEX:
    Okay. Bye.

14:50.188 --> 14:51.422
OUMAS:
                        Bye-bye.

14:51.456 --> 14:52.923
Ah.

14:52.957 --> 14:55.125
Alex, you're
                    not dressed.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.360
No, no, it's you
who's dressed too much.

14:57.395 --> 14:59.163
Oh.

14:59.197 --> 15:02.166
What, uh... What did
         you have in mind to do?

15:02.200 --> 15:03.633
Oh, I don't know.

15:03.668 --> 15:06.938
Walk, talk,
lay down my life.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.739
Well, uh, don't worry.

15:08.773 --> 15:12.475
We have plenty of time
      to, uh, stop by your hotel

15:12.510 --> 15:16.180
and, uh, oh, you can
          change before we go to

15:16.214 --> 15:17.448
the casino, no?

15:17.482 --> 15:18.815
The casino?

15:18.850 --> 15:20.650
Uh, excuse me, uh, Desiree.

15:20.685 --> 15:22.153
I'm a working man.

15:22.187 --> 15:23.955
Just how expensive
        is this casino?

15:23.989 --> 15:28.525
Oh, well, excuse me
     for asking this, Alex,

15:28.560 --> 15:31.696
but, uh, what is it
      you do for a living?

15:31.730 --> 15:33.564
I'm a ca... taxi driver.

15:33.598 --> 15:36.534
Oh! A taxi driver?

15:36.568 --> 15:39.202
It's not the same job
      as it is over here.

15:39.237 --> 15:42.873
You see, taxi drivers are held
in very high esteem in America.

15:44.342 --> 15:46.677
There's a waiting list.

15:46.711 --> 15:50.046
People commit suicide
if they can't get in.

15:50.081 --> 15:52.015
Now, doctors,
over in America,

15:52.049 --> 15:53.850
you wouldn't want
to talk to them.

15:53.885 --> 15:55.586
Riffraff.

15:55.620 --> 15:58.355
As I was saying,
 how expensive is this casino?

15:58.389 --> 16:00.457
Well, I'm afraid

16:00.492 --> 16:03.327
that if you have to ask,
   uh, you cannot afford it.

16:03.361 --> 16:05.195
I have to ask.

16:06.197 --> 16:08.532
Well, look, I am so sorry, Alex,

16:08.567 --> 16:10.935
but, um, I really have

16:10.969 --> 16:12.236
to go to the
                 casino tonight.

16:12.270 --> 16:14.204
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

16:14.239 --> 16:15.572
What kind
of a woman are you?

16:15.606 --> 16:17.174
I mean, you meet a guy,
and you like him,

16:17.208 --> 16:19.243
and just because he can't afford
to take you to a nice place,

16:19.277 --> 16:20.578
you're gonna
                       dump him?

16:20.612 --> 16:22.113
What kind of a person is that?

16:22.147 --> 16:24.714
French.

16:25.950 --> 16:30.688
("Blue Danube" playing)

16:57.982 --> 17:02.786
Ah, Viennese food is so rich
and wonderful and expensive.

17:02.820 --> 17:05.021
(wry chuckle)

17:06.491 --> 17:08.157
Yeah, I agree with you.

17:08.192 --> 17:11.729
Why smile
   when we're all gonna die?

17:11.762 --> 17:14.698
I'll have a clear broth
for now.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.901
What-what...
what comes with that?

17:17.935 --> 17:20.471
A sprig of parsley.

17:20.505 --> 17:22.039
Can you substitute meatloaf?

17:27.878 --> 17:29.146
Hello.

17:29.180 --> 17:30.481
Ah.

17:30.515 --> 17:33.183
All dressed for another
great evening, huh?

17:33.218 --> 17:35.752
Who is the lucky Prussian?

17:35.786 --> 17:37.320
Oh, Alex,
                   you're broke.

17:37.355 --> 17:40.057
Why don't you let me
            loan you some money?

17:40.091 --> 17:42.626
Of course. I've been waiting
for you to loan me money.

17:42.661 --> 17:44.494
What'd you think
I was going to say?

17:44.529 --> 17:45.863
I'd rather be hungry?
Pride?

17:45.897 --> 17:47.197
Give me money.

17:47.231 --> 17:48.866
(laughs)
Thank you.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.534
Where are you going?

17:50.568 --> 17:52.336
Why are you asking me this?

17:52.370 --> 17:54.204
It's become my hobby.

17:54.238 --> 17:57.174
I'm going to a
                   dinner party.

17:57.209 --> 17:59.510
Oh.

17:59.544 --> 18:01.979
Thank you.

18:02.013 --> 18:03.880
Well, it's a lovely gown.

18:03.915 --> 18:05.082
Oh, thank you.

18:05.116 --> 18:06.583
It's an original.

18:06.617 --> 18:08.552
One of your dates buy it
            for you?

18:08.586 --> 18:09.820
No, he designed it for me.

18:11.756 --> 18:13.957
Don't be bitter.

18:13.991 --> 18:16.359
This is not bitterness.
This is admiration.
                         (sighs)

18:16.394 --> 18:18.562
The guy you met in France
owned a vineyard.

18:18.596 --> 18:20.764
The guy in London was a member
         of Parliament.

18:20.798 --> 18:22.366
And that aging contessa in Italy

18:22.400 --> 18:24.268
who called you
daughter.

18:24.302 --> 18:26.737
And that monk who broke
    a 30-year vow of silence

18:26.771 --> 18:27.938
just to say wow.

18:27.972 --> 18:28.939
In Spanish!

18:28.973 --> 18:30.107
<i>Yo!</i>

18:32.343 --> 18:34.411
You haven't enjoyed Europe.

18:34.445 --> 18:36.580
Oh, what makes you say a thing
           like that?

18:36.614 --> 18:39.116
I got the idea
    that night in Barcelona

18:39.150 --> 18:41.518
when, uh, I heard you
        in the next room

18:41.553 --> 18:45.055
crying yourself to sleep.

18:45.089 --> 18:45.922
You heard that?

18:47.392 --> 18:48.959
Oh, I don't know.

18:48.993 --> 18:52.529
(sighs) Maybe I was expecting
too much from Europe.

18:52.564 --> 18:55.432
I-I-I thought
it was all gonna be romance,

18:55.467 --> 18:59.069
but instead,
it's just all Europe.

18:59.103 --> 19:01.105
I know.

19:01.139 --> 19:03.407
I saw countries
    and people and culture,

19:03.441 --> 19:07.077
but I didn't meet that woman
    on a cobblestone street

19:07.111 --> 19:09.212
who doesn't speak a word
          of English,

19:09.247 --> 19:14.284
and without a word, makes
 the greatest night of my life.

19:16.120 --> 19:19.356
I wanted a night like that.

19:21.926 --> 19:24.427
You solved the cube!

19:24.462 --> 19:26.897
Oh, my gosh, how
                did you do that?

19:26.931 --> 19:28.432
I tore off
     the little color spots

19:28.466 --> 19:29.966
and put them
     where they should be.

19:30.001 --> 19:31.201
Oh.

19:33.204 --> 19:35.572
You know, Alex, maybe
 I'll cancel my plans tonight,

19:35.607 --> 19:37.141
and then you and I could spend

19:37.175 --> 19:38.542
our last evening
      in Europe together.

19:38.576 --> 19:40.144
I don't know.
        Would you like that?

19:40.178 --> 19:41.578
I don't know.
I don't know.

19:41.613 --> 19:44.247
Elaine, I mean, if you
and I went out together tonight,

19:44.281 --> 19:46.216
you know, with the moon
and the Danube

19:46.250 --> 19:47.818
and the schnitzel
in the air,

19:47.852 --> 19:50.053
and me being one
of the most depressed tourists

19:50.088 --> 19:51.989
you'll ever find
on this whole damn continent,

19:52.023 --> 19:53.557
I don't know
what might happen.

19:53.591 --> 19:55.592
I mean, before we left
       the United States,

19:55.626 --> 19:57.827
I was... I-I-I-I was afraid
            of that.

19:59.597 --> 20:01.365
Now I don't even know <i>why</i>

20:01.399 --> 20:03.166
I'm afraid of that.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.002
Oh, Elaine, I'm just
a broken man who's very grateful

20:05.036 --> 20:06.470
for the fact
    that you're even talking

20:06.504 --> 20:08.071
to me. Thank you
for talking to me.

20:08.105 --> 20:09.305
Thank you
for talking to me!

20:09.340 --> 20:10.474
Am I saying this?

20:10.508 --> 20:11.775
Thank you
for talking to me!

20:11.809 --> 20:13.577
Aw.

20:13.611 --> 20:15.345
Oh, I was hoping
      you'd say just that.

20:17.214 --> 20:18.415
Is this postcard
                addressed to me?

20:18.450 --> 20:20.984
Oh, no. No, no, no, I-I was
gonna mail... I was gonna...

20:21.018 --> 20:23.620
No, no, no, no, no. Come
      on, Alex, let me see this.

20:23.654 --> 20:24.821
"Dear Elaine,

20:24.855 --> 20:26.957
"the time we spent
   writing postcards together

20:26.991 --> 20:28.992
was the best part of my trip."

20:32.363 --> 20:34.231
(sighs)

20:34.265 --> 20:36.233
I don't know what to say.

20:36.267 --> 20:37.634
Say "Aw."

20:37.668 --> 20:39.570
Aw?

20:39.604 --> 20:40.837
I know.

20:40.871 --> 20:42.139
I love it.

20:42.173 --> 20:43.540
(laughs)

20:43.574 --> 20:45.042
But you weren't supposed
          to read this

20:45.076 --> 20:46.543
until we got back to New York,

20:46.577 --> 20:47.945
and it wouldn't spoil
        our friendship.

20:47.979 --> 20:49.412
Oh, right.

20:49.447 --> 20:52.149
Yeah, let's not spoil
        our friendship.

20:52.183 --> 20:53.917
No.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.254
You know, Alex,

20:58.289 --> 21:01.525
we've known each other
      for four years now.

21:01.559 --> 21:03.193
Yeah.

21:03.227 --> 21:05.629
And we've seen
                      each other

21:05.663 --> 21:07.997
depressed, neurotic,

21:08.032 --> 21:12.402
sad, angry, hostile,

21:12.436 --> 21:16.239
stupid, ugly.

21:16.273 --> 21:18.942
And yet,
 we've still remained friends.

21:23.848 --> 21:27.250
Maybe our friendship
        is strong enough

21:27.284 --> 21:29.820
to survive one night of...

21:29.854 --> 21:31.988
love.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.701
You want to go for a walk?

21:47.705 --> 21:49.873
I'd love to.

22:01.051 --> 22:02.352
(sighs)

22:02.387 --> 22:04.454
I finally got a date in Europe.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.491
("Blue Danube" playing)

22:47.899 --> 22:49.432
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters.</i>

22:49.466 --> 22:50.700
(grumbling)

22:51.305 --> 22:57.320
