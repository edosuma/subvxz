you need the secret ingredient.

OKAY, HONEY, JUST MAKE
SURE YOU GET MY GOOD SIDE.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.135

- OH, IS THAT THE SCHOOL PLAY?
- YEAH, I WAS PETER PAN

02:29.283 --> 02:32.353
AND SHE WAS NANA THE DOG...
WELL, THE BACK END OF THE DOG.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.422
OH, AND HERE WE ARE AT
OUR CAMP SWIM MEET.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.290
I GOT FIRST PLACE.
SHE GOT PINK EYE.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.393
I'M SEEING A PATTERN
HERE, BURKE.

02:39.427 --> 02:42.196
YOU WERE ALWAYS THE STAR
AND SHE WAS BASICALLY...

02:42.230 --> 02:44.398
THE DOG'S ASS.

02:44.432 --> 02:47.335
YEAH, BUT DESPITE THAT
WE WERE LIKE SISTERS.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.170
YOU KNOW? UNTIL PUBERTY.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.273
THAT'S WHERE SHE
FINALLY CAME IN FIRST.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.407
OH! YEAH, WOW,

02:53.441 --> 02:55.209
NO OFFENSE THERE, BURKEY,

02:55.243 --> 02:57.211
BUT SHE LEFT YOU
IN THE DUST THERE.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.414
THAT'S DUST WITH A DOUBLE "D."

03:00.448 --> 03:03.384
AND YET I STILL BEAT HER
OUT FOR PROM QUEEN.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.354
UH, WITH LOVE AND RESPECT,

03:06.387 --> 03:08.356
UM, HOW?

03:08.389 --> 03:11.292
OH, SHE WAS SUSPENDED
FROM THE PROM.D BANNED

03:11.325 --> 03:13.461
I MEAN, IT WASN'T
ANYTHING I DID, YOU KNOW,

03:13.494 --> 03:16.297
OR PLANTED IN HER LOCKER
THAT THE PRINCIPAL FOUND,

03:16.330 --> 03:18.299
LIKE SCHNAPPS.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.468
I SEE. SO THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE DOING ALL THIS.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.936
- 'CAUSE YOU STILL FEEL GUILTY.
- A LITTLE.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.939
AND I WANT THE WHOLE FAMILY
HAS CHANGED.MEL BURKE

03:25.973 --> 03:28.309
SO I AM UNSELFISHLY GIVING
EMILY THE GREATEST GIFT

03:28.342 --> 03:30.278
ONE WOMAN CAN GIVE ANOTHER.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.246
A KIDNEY?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.282
I'M LETTING HER GET
MARRIED BEFORE ME.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.317
AND IF SHE EVER
NEEDS A KIDNEY...

03:36.350 --> 03:38.419
SHE CAN DIE KNOWING SHE
GOT MARRIED FIRST.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.324
THAT IS EVERY DEAD GIRL'S DREAM.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.494
AND THE NAPKIN
COLOR IS SELECTED.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.397
IT'S IVORY BY A LANDSLIDE.
SUCK IT, PEACH.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.199
WHO WANTS TO GO OUTSIDE AND
TALK FLOWER PLACEMENT?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.367
OH, I WOULD LOVE TO. SWEETIE?

03:53.401 --> 03:55.936

ALL MARRIED BEFORE ME.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.479
- LOOKING GOOD.
- OH, YOU THINK IT LOOKS GOOD NOW,

04:05.513 --> 04:07.448
WAIT TILL YOU SEE IT
WITH THE FROSTING ON IT.

04:07.481 --> 04:10.384
'CAUSE THE FROSTING WILL
BE THE ICING ON THE CAKE.

04:12.453 --> 04:16.324
MUST BE HARD TO FOCUS ON YOUR WORK
WITH ALL THESE HOT WOMEN IN THE HOUSE.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.493
YEAH, IT'S HARD, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I FIND A WAY TO SOLDIER ON.

04:19.527 --> 04:23.364
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T MIND
HAVING A HOT GUY IN MY HOUSE.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.334
( forced laugh )

04:26.367 --> 04:28.436
ACTUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING ABOUT MAKING A CAKE

04:28.469 --> 04:31.271
IS THESE FOUR DOWELS BECAUSE IT
PREVENTS THE TOP TIER FROM...

04:31.305 --> 04:32.473
HANDS!

04:32.506 --> 04:35.008
DID I GET A LITTLE CLOSE THERE?

04:35.042 --> 04:36.977
UHH, MAYBE.

04:38.379 --> 04:41.415
BIANCA, EMMY WANTS YOU OUT THERE
TO APPROVE CENTERPIECE PLACEMENT.

04:41.449 --> 04:44.017
AND BY THAT I MEAN NOD AT
WHAT SHE'S ALREADY DECIDED.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.019
ISN'T THAT WHAT
MARRIAGE IS ALL ABOUT?

04:48.989 --> 04:51.325
OH, LOOK, CAKE TOPPERS.

04:51.359 --> 04:54.528
I HAD TO BUY TWO FULL SETS
AND THROW AWAY THE GROOMS.

04:54.562 --> 04:57.030
( whispers ) BIANCA
JUST HIT ON ME.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.432
VERY FUNNY.

04:58.466 --> 05:02.002
I'M SERIOUS. SHE JUST
PUT HER HANDS ON ME.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.406
BIANCA? AND YOU'RE CLEAR
ON WHAT A LESBIAN IS?

05:07.408 --> 05:10.010
I THOUGHT SO.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.980
OKAY, SHOW ME ON THE BRIDE WHERE
THE BAD LADY TOUCHED YOU.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.418
I'M SERIOUS, ALL RIGHT?
SHE JUST TOUCHED ME.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.319
PEOPLE TOUCH PEOPLE
ALL THE TIME.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.288
WOW, YOU REALLY HAVE
AN UNBELIEVABLE EGO.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.956
WHA... I... I HAVE
AN UNBELIEVABLE EGO?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.492
YOU'RE THE ONE MAKING
THIS WHOLE DAY ABOUT YOU!

05:24.525 --> 05:26.960
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, "COME ON,
HAVE YOUR WEDDING AT MY HOUSE!

05:26.994 --> 05:28.962
LOOK AT ALL THE AMAZING
THINGS I'M DOING FOR YOU.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.364
CHECK OUT MY HOT NANNY."

05:30.398 --> 05:32.299
AND WHAT EXACTLY IS IT

05:32.332 --> 05:34.502
YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT THIS
FIGMENT OF YOUR IMAGINATION?

05:34.535 --> 05:35.969
TELL THE BRIDE!

05:36.003 --> 05:38.038
THE... THE OTHER BRIDE!

05:38.071 --> 05:40.441
NO WAY! NO, AND RUIN
MY SPECIAL DAY?

05:40.474 --> 05:42.376
...THEIR SPECIAL DAY?

05:47.114 --> 05:49.383
YOU SAW WHAT SHE
DID, DIDN'T YOU?

05:53.120 --> 05:55.322
- MORNING.
- HEY.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.358
TWINKLE LIGHTS FOR THE TRELLIS.
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO?

05:58.392 --> 06:00.093
NO NO NO, EVERYTHING'S HANDLED.

06:00.127 --> 06:04.097
SO HOW MANY OF THESE
CARDS HAVE YOU DONE?

06:04.131 --> 06:06.033
UGH, A FEW... MILLION.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.101
I'M GETTING A
LITTLE HAND CRAMPY.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.537
OH, YOU POOR THING. HERE.

06:09.570 --> 06:13.006
- HOW'S THAT?
- IT FEELS GREAT.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.108
IT'S NOT JUST THE
MUSCLES IN YOUR HAND.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.110
TENSION CAN START IN YOUR WRIST,

06:17.144 --> 06:19.079
YOUR FOREARMS.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.483
NO, I THINK THE TENSION'S
STAYING WAY DOWN HERE

06:22.516 --> 06:24.952
WHERE IT'S SAFE.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.454
IT CAN RADIATE UP
TO YOUR SHOULDERS

06:26.487 --> 06:30.023
AND YOUR NECK...
YOUR LOVELY NECK.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.459
HANDS HANDS!

06:32.460 --> 06:34.394
SO YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN WITH A WOMAN?

06:34.428 --> 06:37.465
NOPE NEVER. NOPE, NOT EVEN IN
COLLEGE WITH MY FRIEND RENEE.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.100
UM, I'D BETTER...

06:40.133 --> 06:42.169
STRING THE LIGHTS.

06:53.981 --> 06:57.818
WOW, EVERYTHING YOU'RE
DOING LOOKS WONDERFUL.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.788
MY MY MY, IT JUST...
IT REALLY LOOKS GREAT.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.723
YES IT DOES, YES IT DOES!

07:02.756 --> 07:04.858
BIANCA JUST HIT ON ME.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.728
- GOD, YOU'RE COMPETITIVE.
- NO, I SWEAR!

07:07.761 --> 07:09.963
SHE TRIED THE WHOLE, YOU
KNOW, "YOU LOOK TENSE,

07:09.997 --> 07:12.700
LET ME GIVE YOU A
HAND MASSAGE." UGH!

07:12.733 --> 07:15.836
I DON'T USUALLY FALL FOR THAT...
SOBER.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.739
RELAX, BURKE, BECAUSE UNLIKE
CERTAIN PEOPLE, I BELIEVE YOU.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.974
AND WATCH HOW I'M NOT GOING
TO SAY, "I TOLD YOU SO!"

07:21.008 --> 07:22.843
WHOOPS.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.078
I'M SORRY I WAS
DISMISSIVE BEFORE.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.716
- YOU GOTTA TELL EMILY NOW.
- MAN, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WEDDING

07:28.749 --> 07:30.984
I'M THROWING FOR EMILY TO SHOW
MY FAMILY I'M A GOOD PERSON?

07:31.018 --> 07:33.854
A GOOD PERSON WOULD SAVE HER
COUSIN FROM THIS MAN-EATER.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.856
WOMAN-EATER.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.090
PEOPLE-EATER.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.929
We're here with Emily
Burke, lesbian-American,

07:41.962 --> 07:44.798
on the day of her commitment
ceremony with her partner.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.767
NOW TELL US, HOW ANGRY ARE YOU

07:46.800 --> 07:48.068
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

07:48.101 --> 07:51.004
REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE
VALIDITY OF YOUR GAY LOVE?

07:51.038 --> 07:52.873
OH, ALL OF OUR
FRIENDS ARE COMING.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.842
THEY'VE BEEN NOTHING
BUT SUPPORTIVE.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.910
- I JUST WISH MY PARENTS WERE HERE.
- AHA!

07:56.944 --> 07:59.780
Stuck in an older
generation's intolerance.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.750
No. No, they're just
stuck in traffic.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.854
SO TELL US THE STORY OF
HOW YOU AND BIANCA MET.

08:06.887 --> 08:10.023
WAS IT A PROTEST RALLY? DID
THE COPS TEAR GAS YOU?

08:10.057 --> 08:13.894
Uh, not quite. It was a
singles mixer at our church.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.098
Strangely there was tear gas.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.834
- REALLY?
- NO NO, I WAS JUST TRYING TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.069
I'M SORRY.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.872
FOR GOD'S SAKE. RYDER, CUT.

08:24.905 --> 08:29.843
- WE'RE GETTING NOTHING.
- HEY, WE WATCH THE W.N.B.A. ALL THE TIME.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.980
DON'T PATRONIZE ME.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.750
- SO I CAN USE LENNOX'S ROOM TO CHANGE?
- YEAH.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.852
YOUR CLOTHES, YOUR MIND,
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.854
GOD, I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO
THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THIS.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.890
YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING TO
MAKE IT THE PERFECT DAY.

08:42.923 --> 08:45.893
YEAH, UH-HUH, WELL, IS
ANYTHING EVER REALLY PERFECT?

08:45.926 --> 08:48.729
THE LOVE BIANCA AND I HAVE FOR
EACH OTHER COMES PRETTY CLOSE.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.998
( inhales ) LOVE'S A
FUNNY THING, YOU KNOW?

08:51.031 --> 08:53.901
YOU COULD LOVE SOMEONE
AND THEY COULD LOVE...

08:53.934 --> 08:56.003
TOUCHING OTHER PEOPLE?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.806
- I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW YOU.
- I'M JUST SAYING

08:58.839 --> 09:00.874
IF YOU WANTED TO CALL
OFF THE WHOLE WEDDING,

09:00.908 --> 09:03.076
I WOULD NOT BE MAD THAT ALL
MY WORK WAS FOR NOTHING.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.880
OKAY, SPIT IT OUT, MEL. YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN THIS EVASIVE SINCE SCHNAPPSGATE.

09:07.981 --> 09:11.051
- BIANCA MADE A PASS AT JOE.
- SHE DID WHAT?

09:11.084 --> 09:13.086
I'M SORRY. SHE, YOU KNOW, SHE...

09:13.120 --> 09:16.023
GRABBED HIM IN HIS GRABBY PARTS...
WELL, THE HIND ONES.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.925
NO NO, THIS MUST BE A MISTAKE.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.828
BIANCA'S A VERY PHYSICALLY
EXPRESSIVE PERSON.

09:20.861 --> 09:24.732
BESIDES, SHE IS NOT INTO GUYS. IT'S ONE
OF THE THINGS THAT BROUGHT US TOGETHER.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.834
WELL, SHE, UH, YEAH, SHE KINDA

09:26.867 --> 09:28.936
MADE A PASS AT ME TOO.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.740
OH, I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.008
YOU CAN'T STAND IT WHEN SOMEONE
ELSE HAS THE SPOTLIGHT,

09:35.042 --> 09:37.945
EVER SINCE THAT SUMMER WHEN
I DEVELOPED BEFORE YOU DID.

09:37.978 --> 09:41.882
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. YOU'RE
MORE OBSESSED WITH BREASTS THAN I AM

09:41.915 --> 09:44.084
- AND I'M CRAZY FOR THOSE PUPPIES.
- NO, EMILY!

09:44.117 --> 09:47.755
I'M JUST TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.
PLEASE DON'T GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.990
I AM GETTING MARRIED BEFORE YOU.
DEAL WITH IT.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.092
NOW CAN WE JUST FORGET WE
EVER HAD THIS CONVERSATION?

09:53.761 --> 09:55.062
- ( door shuts )
- OOOOH.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.999
WELL, I TOLD EMILY AND
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.068
SO THAT'S IT? WE JUST GIVE UP?

10:01.101 --> 10:03.771
LET EMILY MARRY THIS CHEATER?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.939
THIS CRAZY HOT CHEATER?

10:05.973 --> 10:09.076
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO? WE
CAN'T CONVINCE HER WITHOUT PROOF.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.880
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT IF
WE PUT A VIDEO CAMERA

10:12.913 --> 10:16.049
UP IN YOUR ROOM AND THEN
WE CAN LURE BIANCA IN,

10:16.083 --> 10:18.786
GET HER TO MAKE A PASS,
CATCH IT ON TAPE... BANG!

10:18.819 --> 10:20.153
SO TO SPEAK.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.024
A HIDDEN CAMERA? OH, COME ON!

10:24.057 --> 10:25.993
HEY, IT WORKED IN
"AMERICAN PIE."

10:26.026 --> 10:28.862
BUT YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.
THAT'S HISTORICAL FACT.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.900
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, WE'LL
USE ME AS BAIT.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.735
WHAT... YOU?

10:34.768 --> 10:37.037
NO, LOOK, IF WE WANT THIS PLAN
TO WORK, I NEED TO BE THE BAIT.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.908
WHAT? I'M A WOMAN. I'M LESBAIT.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.944
LOOK, SHE CAME ON TO ME
FIRST AND I REJECTED HER.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.813
YOU WERE THE REBOUND PASS.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.015
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T
HAVE TIME TO ARGUE.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.018
I'LL GO GET THE CAMERA AND YOU CAN
BE THE PEANUT BUTTER IN THE TRAP.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.056
EVERYBODY LOVES PEANUT BUTTER.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.168
THAT'S IT. WE INTERVIEWED
EVERYBODY AND GOT NOTHING.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.170
ONE BIGOT... IS THAT
TOO MUCH TO ASK?

11:10.203 --> 11:12.672
YEAH. DAMN SUPPORTIVE
WEDDING GUESTS.

11:12.706 --> 11:15.208
UH, HEY, ARE YOU GUYS
RUNNING THIS SHOW?

11:15.242 --> 11:18.145
YEAH, ARE YOU WITH THE BRIDE OR...
THE OTHER BRIDE?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.413
I'M THE CATERER. I GOT A
VAN FULL OF CHICKEN KIEV.

11:20.447 --> 11:25.152
WAIT, BRIDES? IS THIS ONE
OF THOSE SAME-SEX JOBS?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.154
ROLL CAMERA.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.656
WE WERE WONDERING IF
YOU COULD EXPAND A BIT

11:29.689 --> 11:33.260
ON YOUR FEELINGS? IF YOU HAVE
ANGER, WE WANT TO HEAR IT.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.262
DON'T HOLD BACK.
GAY WEDDINGS, GO.

11:35.295 --> 11:38.165
I don't like 'em.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.334
Yeah, but if you're making money off
of something you don't believe in,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.737
aren't you being a hypocrite?
huh, aren't you?

11:43.771 --> 11:46.206
You're kinda putting
me on the spot here.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.242
No, you put yourself
on the spot.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.311
BY CATERING THIS WEDDING,
YOU'RE ENCOURAGING THIS.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.281
WOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.449
I REALLY WISH YOU
HADN'T TOLD ME THAT.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.219
I FEEL LIKE I'M A
DISGRACE TO CATERING.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.190
YES! MAN, WE NAILED IT.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.725
WE TURNED OVER A ROCK AND
EXPOSED RAW PREJUDICE.

12:05.759 --> 12:08.295
- ( truck departing )
- I TOTALLY MADE HIM SQUIRM.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.298
NO, YOU TOTALLY MADE HIM LEAVE!

12:12.365 --> 12:14.467
WITH ALL THE FOOD FOR
THE WHOLE WEDDING!

12:14.501 --> 12:16.336
DON'T BLAME ME.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.738
BLAME IGNORANCE AND INTOLERANCE.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.274
YEAH WELL, SINCE NEITHER ONE
OF THEM SEEMS TO BE HERE,

12:21.308 --> 12:22.776
I'M GONNA BLAME YOU.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.316
( knocks, door opens )

12:29.349 --> 12:31.351
HEY, ALL RIGHT.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.486
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:33.520 --> 12:36.423
IF YOU WERE HOT AND A LESBIAN,
WOULD YOU GET ALL OVER THIS?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.426
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"IF I WERE HOT"?

12:39.459 --> 12:41.728
STAY WITH ME, ALL RIGHT? STAY WITH ME.
HOW'S THIS?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.430
( clears throat )

12:45.432 --> 12:47.434
HEY, BIANCA.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.237
THAT MIGHT MAKE ME GAY.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.272
JUST THE OUTFIT IS
TRYING TOO HARD.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.241
YOU KNOW? WHAT ABOUT
YOUR PURPLE HENLEY?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.409
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW, IT'S
FITTED, BUT NOT TOO TIGHT

12:56.443 --> 12:58.345
AND IT REALLY BRINGS
OUT YOUR EYES.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.380
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST A
STATEMENT OF FACT.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.482
IT'S IN NO WAY AN ENDORSEMENT.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.452
YOU LIKE THE HENLEY, HUH?

13:05.485 --> 13:07.520
NOT THAT MUCH. OKAY.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.257
SO THE CAMERA IS
LINKED TO MY LAPTOP

13:10.290 --> 13:12.325
SO I'LL BE ABLE TO
MONITOR ALL THE ACTION.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.361
WELL, NOT THE ACTION-ACTION.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.464
JUST THE PRE-ACTION. PLEASE DON'T
AT ANY POINT GET TO THE ACTION.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.233
I GOT IT, I GOT IT. GET
OUTTA HERE, WILL YOU?

13:22.335 --> 13:24.337
SEND HER IN.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.582
OH YEAH, I'D RIDE THIS RIDE.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.320
PEANUT BUTTER.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.522
OH! EXCUSE ME.

13:42.555 --> 13:45.325
MEL TOLD ME THIS
ROOM WAS AVAILABLE.

13:45.358 --> 13:48.495
IT IS. VERY AVAILABLE...

13:49.596 --> 13:52.365
AS WELL AS ANYTHING
YOU SEE IN IT.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.368
LET ME TAKE THAT DRESS FOR YOU.
I'LL JUST HANG IT UP OVER HERE.

13:57.404 --> 14:00.240
SMOOTH, LONGO.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.209
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

14:02.242 --> 14:03.376
ANYTHING YOU WANT
ME TO BE DOING.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.279
FOR INSTANCE I COULD
HELP YOU WITH THAT BAG.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.282
I CAN JUST PUT IT
RIGHT OVER HERE.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.258
Can I help you with
anything else?

14:18.291 --> 14:21.294
'CAUSE I CAN TAKE CARE OF ANYTHING
YOU COULD POSSIBLY NEED...

14:21.328 --> 14:23.563
WITH A VERY GENTLE TOUCH.

14:23.596 --> 14:27.334
WELL, I GUESS THERE IS ONE
THING YOU COULD DO FOR ME.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.335
( laughs )

14:28.368 --> 14:30.470
YEAH?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.372
PLEASE LEAVE SO I CAN GET READY.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.341
BUT ARE YOU... ARE YOU SURE?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.409
- BYE.
- WELL, 'CAUSE I...

14:39.246 --> 14:41.381
I GOT OTHER SHIRTS!

14:47.287 --> 14:49.189
AHEM.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.324
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.561
IT'S LIKE SHE WAS IMMUNE
TO MY POWERS OF SEDUCTION.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.230
YOU MEAN LIKE SHE'S GAY?!

14:58.298 --> 15:00.333
- YOU THINK YOU CAN DO BETTER?
- I KNOW I CAN.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.435
- WATCH AND LEARN.
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE!

15:02.469 --> 15:04.571
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE GONNA
GO UPSTAIRS WEARING THAT?

15:04.604 --> 15:07.240
OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.
YOU LOOK...

15:08.375 --> 15:10.377
OKAY IN THAT.

15:10.410 --> 15:14.381
JUST GO SEDUCE THE LESBIAN AND
STOP YOUR COUSIN'S WEDDING!

15:14.414 --> 15:17.550
- ( knocks )
- 'SUP, GIRLFRIEND?

15:17.584 --> 15:20.520
...OF EMILY.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.256
NOT MUCH. JUST GETTING MARRIED.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.559
- WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?
- I-I... I JUST CAME UP HERE

15:26.593 --> 15:28.461
to look for something.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.463
I think I left it on
the bed over here.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.400
WELL, CAN YOU HELP ME FIND IT?

15:34.434 --> 15:38.238
- WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
- OH, IT'S...

15:38.271 --> 15:40.507
OH, I FOUND IT. IT'S THE
LIGHT IN YOUR EYES.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.210
It does something to me.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.512
YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT.

15:45.545 --> 15:49.216
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU ASKED
ME IF I'VE EVER BEEN WITH A WOMAN.

15:49.249 --> 15:52.219
AND NO, I HAVEN'T.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.221
YEAH, YOU TOLD ME
THAT THIS MORNING.

15:54.254 --> 15:57.257
WELL, NOW THE THOUGHT IS
UNDER MY SKIN LIKE AN ITCH

15:57.290 --> 16:00.493
AND I JUST... I THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU COULD SCRATCH IT.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.595
MEOW.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.565
UM, MEL, IT'S MY WEDDING DAY.

16:05.598 --> 16:09.302
I KNOW. IT MAKES IT EVEN
HOTTER, DOESN'T IT?

16:09.336 --> 16:10.570
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT ALL
SORTS OF ISSUES,

16:10.603 --> 16:12.539
BUT COULD YOU MAYBE
TAKE THEM DOWNSTAIRS?

16:12.572 --> 16:15.342
No, I don't have issues.
I, uh...

16:15.375 --> 16:18.311
I JUST CAME TO HELP, YOU KNOW?
IF YOU NEEDED ANYTHING ZIPPED,

16:18.345 --> 16:20.480
- OR UNZIPPED...
- YEAH, GOODBYE, MEL.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.449
OKAY.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.352
OH, YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.621
IS IT POSSIBLE WE'RE NOT
AS HOT AS WE THINK WE ARE?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.526
I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.231
I MEAN, SHE HAD A SHOT AT THIS.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.499
AND THAT.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.468
WE'RE HERE FOR HAIR AND MAKEUP.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.436
CAN YOU TELL US WHERE
WE FIND BIANCA?

16:43.470 --> 16:45.405
OH YEAH, RIGHT UP THOSE STAIRS.
FIRST DOOR.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.509
WELL, I'D BETTER GO
APOLOGIZE TO EMILY.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.444
- I FEEL JUST AWFUL.
- HEY LOOK,

16:51.478 --> 16:53.446
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

16:53.480 --> 16:56.349
IF I SAW YOU IN A BAR
AND I DIDN'T KNOW YOU

16:56.383 --> 16:59.552
AND YOU DIDN'T SPEAK OR INTERACT WITH ME
IN ANY WAY, I WOULD PROBABLY HIT THAT.

16:59.586 --> 17:03.290
AW, THANKS. AND IF
I SAW YOU IN A BAR

17:03.323 --> 17:05.558
I'D BE ALL "WHO'S LOOKING
AFTER THE KIDS?"

17:05.592 --> 17:07.627
NO, SERIOUSLY, YOU LOOK FINE.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.564
OKAY, WE'RE IN MAJOR TROUBLE.

17:11.598 --> 17:15.302
PERHAPS IT WASN'T A GOOD IDEA
TO PISS OFF THE CATERER!

17:15.335 --> 17:18.471
- HE WAS A BIGOT.
- GET OVER IT!

17:18.505 --> 17:21.474
WELL, I CALLED EVERY OTHER
CATERING PLACE IN TOWN.

17:21.508 --> 17:25.512
- THEY LAUGHED AT ME.
- WE CAN ALWAYS ORDER A BUNCH OF PIZZAS.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.248
THIS IS A WEDDING, NOT
A SUPER BOWL PARTY!

17:28.281 --> 17:30.517
PIZZAS AREN'T CLASSY ENOUGH.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.485
UNLESS...

17:32.519 --> 17:36.489
UNLESS YOU CUT THEM INTO LITTLE
SQUARES AND CALL THEM PIZZETTAS.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.260
I WATCH A LOT OF "TOP CHEF."

17:41.561 --> 17:44.231
- EVERYBODY'S OUTSIDE. WE CAN TALK IN HERE.
- FINE!

17:44.264 --> 17:46.399
WHAT IS IT? WHO DID
BIANCA FEEL UP NOW?

17:46.433 --> 17:49.369
MY GRANDMA WAS
LOOKING KINDA HAPPY.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.603
OH NO, BIANCA
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.605
IT TURNS OUT THE WHOLE
THING WAS IN OUR MINDS.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.275
WELL, MOSTLY IN JOE'S.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.377
- I'M SORRY.
- YOU SHOULD BE SORRY.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.612
JUST LET ME GET THIS OFF MY CHEST
BEFORE YOU WALK DOWN THE AISLE.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.549
- THERE'S MORE?
- WE THOUGHT WE NEEDED PROOF

18:02.582 --> 18:06.453
SO JOE AND I TOOK A CAMERA...
MOSTLY JOE...

18:06.486 --> 18:08.321
AND PUT IT IN MY BEDROOM

18:08.355 --> 18:10.490
AND WE TRIED TO GET
BIANCA TO HIT ON US

18:10.523 --> 18:12.425
SO THAT YOU COULD SEE
IT FOR YOURSELF.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.328
- YOU BITCH!
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.465
- YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT IN THE WORLD TO SAY THAT.
- NOT YOU, BIANCA!

18:18.498 --> 18:20.467
- ( moaning )
- OH MY...

18:20.500 --> 18:23.503
WITH THE HAIR GUY?!
AND THE MAKEUP GIRL.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.539
AND ON MY BRAND-NEW DUVET.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.508
OH, I AM GONNA KILL HER.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.278
WELL... NOT ON THE DUVET.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.614
WHERE THE HECK IS SHE GO...
HELLO!

18:36.349 --> 18:37.617
NO, THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU TURN IT OFF.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.287
NO, I'M JUST TRYING TO ZOOM IN HERE.
HOLD ON.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.460
BOY, CANCELING THE WEDDING SURE
THROWS A WRENCH IN THE HONEYMOON.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.562
HEY, YOU SHOULD STILL
GO ON THE CRUISE.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.531
- BY MYSELF?
- YEAH SURE!

18:51.564 --> 18:53.533
MAYBE YOU'LL MEET SOMEBODY NICE.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.403
A WHOLE BOATFUL OF
LIKE-MINDED LADIES.

18:57.404 --> 19:00.507
- TO A WHOLE NEW START.
- OH, THANK YOU, MELLY.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.476
AND I'M SO SORRY I DIDN'T
BELIEVE YOU ABOUT BIANCA.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.246
I UNDERSTAND. I DON'T HAVE
THE BEST TRACK RECORD.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.581
- BUT I REALLY WAS JUST LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.
- I KNOW YOU WERE.

19:08.615 --> 19:12.252
AND HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU COULD
STILL BEAT ME TO THE ALTAR.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.587
I DOUBT IT. THERE ISN'T ANYBODY
I CAN SEE THAT HAPPENING WITH.

19:14.621 --> 19:18.558
LADIES, CAN I OFFER
YOU SOME PIZZETTAS?

19:18.591 --> 19:22.529
IF YOU LIKE THEM, I HAVE 5,000
MORE OF THESE IN THE KITCHEN.

19:22.562 --> 19:26.266
BY THE WAY, I LOADED UP YOUR CAR WITH
THE FIRST ROUND OF PRESENTS, OKAY?

19:26.299 --> 19:28.435
EVEN THE ONE THAT WAS...
VIBRATING.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.571
THANK YOU, JOE. THAT'S MY...

19:31.604 --> 19:34.574
THAT'S MY TOOTHBRUSH. I'M JUST
GONNA GO TURN IT OFF NOW.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.480
OH, I FEEL TERRIBLE
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

19:40.513 --> 19:42.515
LIKE I'M SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE.

19:42.549 --> 19:46.319
WOW, YOU EVEN GRAB THE
CREDIT WHEN THINGS GO WRONG.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.621
YOU'RE RIGHT, JOE.

19:48.655 --> 19:52.359
I'M SELFISH. ALWAYS HAVE
BEEN, ALWAYS WILL BE.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.395
YEP, YOU ARE PROBABLY THE MOST
SELFISH PERSON I'VE EVER MET.

19:55.428 --> 19:58.531
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU... YOU TOOK
YOUR SISTER'S TWO KIDS IN,

19:58.565 --> 20:01.301
TURNED YOUR LIFE
COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN,

20:01.334 --> 20:04.404
AND EVERY DAY YOU WORK TIRELESSLY TO
MAKE THE CITY A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.574
SAME OLD PARTY-GIRL BURKE. I DON'T
EVEN KNOW HOW YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF.

20:07.607 --> 20:11.344
REALLY? YOU THINK I'M OKAY?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.515
EH.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.626
YOU KNOW, THIS CAKE REALLY
IS A THING OF BEAUTY.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.628
YEAH, THANK YOU.
STURDY AS A ROCK TOO.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.698
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO KNOCK THAT THING
OVER... GO AHEAD, GIVE IT A TRY.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.501
- GOOD LUCK.
- WOW, AS FUN AS THAT SOUNDS,

20:34.534 --> 20:35.868
I ACTUALLY PREFER
TO EAT MY CAKE.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.538
FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE TO
CUT THE CAKE CORRECTLY.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.773
- I KNOW HOW TO CUT A CAKE.
- OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO CUT A CAKE,

20:40.807 --> 20:42.842
BECAUSE YOU WERE TRYING TO CUT
IT, BUT IT WAS NOT CORRECT.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.645
YOU NEED TO CUT IT LIKE A PIE,
SO LOOK, YOU GO IN LIKE THIS,

20:47.547 --> 20:49.749
THEN YOU SCOOP IT UP UNDER.
PERFECT.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.584
BOOM! JUST LIKE THAT.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.721
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE.
- GIVE IT A TASTE, GO AHEAD.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.790
HUH?

20:57.824 --> 20:59.692
WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

20:59.726 --> 21:01.794
IT'S NOT VERY MOIST.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.830
NOT MOIST? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

21:03.863 --> 21:06.633
- HERE, TRY.
- IT'S PERFECTLY MOI...

21:09.669 --> 21:11.504
YOU KNOW WHAT? NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.506
THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY VERY MOIST.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.808
THE THING ABOUT IT IS, UM,

21:15.842 --> 21:17.810
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU HAD
A BIG ENOUGH BITE, SEE?
