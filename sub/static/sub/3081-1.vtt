There's just
one more in the
laundry room.

00:53.054 --> 00:55.054
           It's okay.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.119
  Mom...

01:27.121 --> 01:29.388
                         What?

01:48.175 --> 01:53.412
    See, everything's fine.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.474
            Ashley!

02:22.476 --> 02:24.143
    We're going to be late.

02:24.145 --> 02:26.345
          I'm coming.

02:28.215 --> 02:31.150
  Sure you don't want to wear
   something a little nicer?

02:31.152 --> 02:33.218
        No mom, I don't.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.387
        Okay. You ready?

02:35.389 --> 02:37.456
             Sure.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.225
     It's going to be fine.

02:40.227 --> 02:43.228
   Yeah, just another school.

02:53.174 --> 02:55.374
                Okay stop! Stop,
                stop, stop.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.341
What, here?

02:56.343 --> 02:58.544
                           Yeah.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.413
        Ashley, that's a
          bit extreme.

03:01.415 --> 03:05.317
         Mom, it's not
        worth the risk.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.500
      [Muttering] The most
    powerful civilization...

03:26.440 --> 03:28.507
              Hi.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.476
           Oh, here.

03:32.446 --> 03:35.414
  Thanks.
                      I got it.

03:36.283 --> 03:39.718
     A fight... A fight to
           the death!

03:52.433 --> 03:54.499
          Wanna move?

03:57.304 --> 03:59.304
          Nice hoodie.

04:11.819 --> 04:15.387
        Oh, uh, thanks.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.726
Miss Beardall used to
work out of here

04:20.728 --> 04:22.361
so I hope this is okay
for you as well.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.330
                      Of course.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.298
Good because we don't have any
extra office space available.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.435
Okay, let's see, you have
your first hour off,

04:30.437 --> 04:32.504
class in the second
hour, fourth hour,

04:32.506 --> 04:35.374
lunch and a sixth
hour class.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.276
                           Okay.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.345
And if you need
any help, call me.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.284
That is Mr. Carlisle.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.854
                  What is he...?

04:48.856 --> 04:51.657
Don't even get
me started.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.725
I need to get back
to my office.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.395
Stop in this afternoon?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.398
            Thanks.

05:15.616 --> 05:16.615
             Maxie!

05:16.617 --> 05:18.317
 Hey! Don't do that!

05:18.319 --> 05:19.851
         Wait, did you
         say something?

05:19.853 --> 05:21.620
     That's what I thought.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.388
Yo, Burnside.
                  What's up man?

05:23.390 --> 05:24.489
 You going to Cal's
   this weekend?

05:24.491 --> 05:27.326
                    Yeah dude!

05:31.498 --> 05:35.567
      All right everyone,
        take your seats.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.502
        I see we have a
          new student.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.771
       Please stand, tell
         us your name.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.544
         Um, my name is
         Ashley Evans.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.446
      Hopefully you're not
         too far behind

05:47.448 --> 05:48.814
     in the curriculum but
        I'll get to you.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.382
        Just sit there.

05:50.384 --> 05:53.585
    It's always nice to have
     some fresh blood here.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.488
      Let's turn our text
       books to page 207.

06:01.562 --> 06:05.397
     [Students chattering]

06:11.805 --> 06:13.438
       Hey, check it out.
       She's that girl...

06:13.440 --> 06:14.940
          Oh whatever.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.613
            Romans!

06:21.615 --> 06:24.416
        Did you see how
        high she jumped?

06:24.418 --> 06:27.853
    Ah, good morning class.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.555
    Ancient Rome was one of
       the most powerful,

06:30.557 --> 06:35.460
 most technologically advanced
    societies in the world.

06:35.462 --> 06:39.831
        Also one of the
         most violent.

06:39.833 --> 06:44.469
    Now, can someone tell me
     what the coliseum was?

06:44.471 --> 06:47.506
   Oh, my parents saw it on a
 cruise they went on last year.

06:47.508 --> 06:51.543
            Awesome!
          What was it?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.646
           Awesome.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.847
           Oh, oh...

06:55.849 --> 06:57.582
              Wei?

06:57.584 --> 06:59.651
         Col-i-see-um,

06:59.653 --> 07:03.422
    an amphitheater in Rome.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.591
   Wei scores! Yes, it is the
     amphitheater in Rome.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.127
         Thank-you Wei.

07:09.128 --> 07:11.662
   Now, the coliseum was the
  mecca of all entertainment.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.866
 Let's say you wanted to go and
   see two warriors fighting.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.668
                           Yeah!

07:16.670 --> 07:20.272
      Where would you sit?

07:20.273 --> 07:23.875
  Sitting? I'd be fighting in
    the middle of the arena.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.511
             Yeah!

07:26.513 --> 07:29.514
        That's a beast.
          Okay, Nick?

07:29.516 --> 07:32.517
      Box seats - wherever
        the emperor sat.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.453
         Okay. Carrie?

07:34.455 --> 07:36.688
     I guess that makes me
       queen. Or empress.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.458
     No way I'm sitting in
       the last section.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.460
       Totally! I get it.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.462
             Totes!

07:43.463 --> 07:45.463
    All right, anyone else?
              Max?

07:45.466 --> 07:47.666
   Oh, I'd probably just be--

07:47.668 --> 07:51.470
 Max, he'd be in the middle of
the coliseum wetting his pants.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.939
   Yeah, I'd kick his butt.

07:53.941 --> 07:57.476
 Well as a gladiator you'd have
    many opponents to fight.

07:57.478 --> 07:58.677
         Sure would...

07:58.679 --> 08:00.812
         Yeah with one
        big difference.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.714
        What'd you say?

08:02.716 --> 08:04.549
          Uh, nothing.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.651
   No, you said something...

08:06.653 --> 08:09.521
    What was the difference?

08:09.523 --> 08:10.655
            Well...

08:10.657 --> 08:12.557
   they fought to the death.

08:12.559 --> 08:16.661
     Blondie's right. They
      fought to the death

08:16.663 --> 08:19.664
       because they were
       the lowest class.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.217
             What?

08:22.218 --> 08:24.769
 Most of them were prisoners of
    war, slaves, criminals.

08:24.771 --> 08:28.507
    Or just people that the
    Romans used to torture.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.675
      They had no choice.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.745
     It was either fight...

08:33.746 --> 08:36.515
            or die.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.985
    Throughout the coliseum
       crowds roared and

08:39.986 --> 08:44.756
     people flocked to see
       the latest fight.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.591
 Remind you of anything today?

08:46.593 --> 08:48.593
          Um, boxing.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.996
  Battles we gather to watch.
         Anything else?

08:50.998 --> 08:54.533
     Oh, American football.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.700
           Yes, Wei.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.701
            Movies.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.570
 That's very insightful Carrie.

08:58.572 --> 09:02.741
See, violence is as much a part
      of our society today

09:02.743 --> 09:05.360
   as it was in ancient Rome.

09:05.361 --> 09:07.978
 Now, we may not literally kill
people for entertainment anymore

09:07.981 --> 09:11.716
    but we do flock to death
         and suffering.

09:11.718 --> 09:12.984
  You ever rubber neck on the
        side of the road

09:12.986 --> 09:14.653
      to see an accident?

09:14.655 --> 09:16.555
      When someone's house
       goes up in flames

09:16.557 --> 09:19.624
   why do we rush to film it
      on our cell phones?

09:19.626 --> 09:21.560
   You ever leave a negative
         comment online

09:21.562 --> 09:24.029
   or spread a rumor for all
       the world to see?

09:24.031 --> 09:26.731
      I know we talk about
       the Romans and how

09:26.733 --> 09:29.000
     they really delighted
       in the bloodshed,

09:29.002 --> 09:33.004
 but I think the real question
 today for us here is this...

09:33.006 --> 09:35.774
         Why do we take
        so much delight

09:35.776 --> 09:39.044
       in watching other
         people suffer?

09:39.046 --> 09:42.013
       History is always
         in the making.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.815
         What will your
          history be?

09:43.817 --> 09:46.585
          [bell rings]

09:53.927 --> 09:55.994

 Uh, here.

09:58.765 --> 09:59.664
                       Thanks.

09:59.666 --> 10:00.599

10:02.836 --> 10:04.669
What's your next class?

10:04.671 --> 10:06.605
                    Uh, spanish.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.772
I've got drama.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.609
I hear there's a new
teacher today.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.381
             Later!

10:16.383 --> 10:18.817
      Okay, well welcome.

10:18.819 --> 10:19.951
       I'm really looking
       forward to hearing

10:19.953 --> 10:22.621
        what you've been
        doing in drama.

10:22.623 --> 10:26.024
 Um, so what play have you been
   working on this semester?

10:27.828 --> 10:30.095
        Any of the roles
        been cast yet or

10:30.097 --> 10:32.831
      are we still in the
        casting process?

10:36.837 --> 10:38.903
            Anyone?

10:40.107 --> 10:43.642
         Oh, thank-you.

10:44.845 --> 10:48.647
       Honey can you hand
          me a tomato?

10:53.887 --> 10:56.888
     So? How'd it go today?

10:56.890 --> 10:59.858
      It was just school.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.895
        Come on, tell me
        about one class.

11:03.897 --> 11:08.099
       Okay, um, history
           was good.

11:08.101 --> 11:12.671
   Really? The teacher seems
       kind of eccentric.

11:12.673 --> 11:13.738
          Yeah he was.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.740
        Okay, look, it's
          not perfect.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.592
      But we're lucky you
     know it's hard to find

11:17.593 --> 11:19.443
    a position in the middle
      of the school year.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.979
    So does that mean we're
             lucky

11:20.981 --> 11:23.014
    that the previous drama
         teacher died?

11:24.251 --> 11:26.284
     Lemonade from lemons.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.777

12:33.353 --> 12:35.820

12:41.094 --> 12:44.229
Here's your mom's
locker you loser.
            Ow, no, come on man!

12:44.231 --> 12:45.714
      What's your problem?

12:45.715 --> 12:47.198
  I can't believe you stabbed
   me in the back like this.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.767
         I trusted you.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.001

                   Of all people

12:50.003 --> 12:52.070
             I can't believe you
             went and did that.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.776
         Ok, thank-you.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.021
                             Hi.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.222
Hi.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.024
               Where did you get
               this dress?

13:13.026 --> 13:15.860
Um, I got it from a costume
store years ago.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.797
I'm thinking about using
it for our play.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.032
I'm Julie Johnson by the way.
I'm the new drama teacher.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.902
                 Kevin Carlisle,
                 history.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.871
          Wow, you've taken such
          good care of it.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.911
           Thank-you.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.070
        Hey, watch this.

14:00.307 --> 14:03.074
       Hey, pick it up!

14:05.412 --> 14:08.079
   [clucking like a chicken]

14:31.938 --> 14:34.038
  You gotta give them credit.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.875
        They know how to
      make their own fun.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.113
      Want the run down on
         everyone here?

14:42.115 --> 14:45.083
        Uh, yeah, sure.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.086
 All right. Well, there you've
    got your intellectuals.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.954
They got a full ride scholarship

14:49.956 --> 14:51.923
 through all the universities.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.092
     They're nice enough.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.127
    Then we got the foreign
      exchange students.

14:56.129 --> 15:00.999
  You know, Brazilian, German,
 Italian, French. Norwegians.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.901
  Now, they're always hanging
      out with each other,

15:02.903 --> 15:06.070
 but none of them know english.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.140
   You gotta wonder how they
       communicate right?

15:09.142 --> 15:14.012
     Then, right there, the
 skaters and the drama geeks.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.714
 You know they merged together

15:15.715 --> 15:17.415
      because one of them
     was dating the other.

15:17.417 --> 15:21.953
Now it was very Romeo and Juliet
  at first but now it's cool.

15:21.955 --> 15:25.990
    Then, Nick's the leader
        of that... um...

15:25.992 --> 15:27.992
             Gang?

15:27.994 --> 15:29.461
Yeah.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.929
      You know you've got
   Burnside right next to him

15:30.931 --> 15:33.398
   who is 95% mass, 5% brain.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.134
    Then you've got Carrie,
         the queen bee.

15:36.136 --> 15:40.004
 Got a whole hive following her
    all the time, you know.

15:40.006 --> 15:44.175
     As long as they're on
      top they don't care.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.178
      Okay. So they're the
        group to avoid.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.181
        Yeah, well I try
        to ignore them.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.017
      You know high school
         isn't forever.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.357
        [metal clanking]

16:13.139 --> 16:16.074
           Oh, cool.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.042
                Um, where is...?

16:18.044 --> 16:20.144
Oh yeah, I'll show you.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.046
                           Okay.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.999
       [students chuckle]

16:45.238 --> 16:48.272
     You spend way too much
     time on your costumes.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.178
    Carrie, how long did it
            take you

16:54.180 --> 16:56.347
    to pick out your
    clothes this morning?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.149
       I changed a couple
          of times...

16:58.151 --> 16:59.217
       Maybe 20 minutes.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.252
Oh, girls

17:01.254 --> 17:03.254
                 Not just girls.

17:03.256 --> 17:07.258
  Uh, Nick if I'm not mistaken
     you're wearing a shirt

17:07.260 --> 17:10.461
       from one of those
         guy boutiques.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.463
What?

17:12.464 --> 17:14.365
     You act like you just
     picked whatever shirt

17:14.367 --> 17:16.467
        it is you wanted
       out of your closet

17:16.469 --> 17:21.138
       And I'm willing to
     bet you paid... what?

17:21.141 --> 17:24.242
       50 dollars for it?

17:24.243 --> 17:26.511
         It was 70, so?

17:26.512 --> 17:28.046
        Well doesn't it
        mean something?

17:28.048 --> 17:30.214
    What we wear every day?

17:30.216 --> 17:34.218
        Maybe not a lot.
     But we think about it.

17:34.220 --> 17:38.289
       It's a part of us,
      part of our culture.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.325
      Part of our history.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.062
            Come on.

17:50.103 --> 17:53.071
        Since the early
         age of knights

17:53.073 --> 17:54.305
        we've often had
        romantic notions

17:54.307 --> 17:59.143
        of how wonderful
        these men were.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.512
          Riding in on
         white horses,

18:01.514 --> 18:04.248
        rescuing damsels
          in distress.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.317
       But who were they?

18:06.319 --> 18:11.255
    Well, most knights were
      sons of aristocrats.

18:11.257 --> 18:15.093
  Noble upper-class families.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.161
       Anyone ever heard
          of chivalry?

18:17.163 --> 18:19.530
     Um, like when you open
      the door for a girl?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.165
       How would he know?
       It's not like any

18:21.167 --> 18:23.301
     girl's gonna get that
     close to him anyways.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.503
       [students chuckle]

18:25.505 --> 18:28.106
       Yeah, that's what
       it's become today.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.508
    It's been watered down.

18:31.177 --> 18:32.443
           Yes, Wei.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.378
           Chil-vary.

18:34.380 --> 18:38.182
    The rules and customs of
     medieval k-nighthood.

18:38.184 --> 18:42.353
     Yes. It was a code of
    conduct for the knights.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.323
   Honesty, obedience to God,

18:45.325 --> 18:48.292
  loyalty to king and country.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.596
     Humility and charity.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.464
          What a drag.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.367
    Knights were protectors
          of the weak.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.302
      They were warriors.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.371
   Not just for battle sake.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.442
        But to protect.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.146
      Wouldn't you want to
     become a knight today?

19:08.148 --> 19:09.313
          Not really.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.481
            Why not?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.250
      What's the point of
      being a great knight

19:12.252 --> 19:13.751
     if that's all you do?

19:13.753 --> 19:17.321
  A knight stood on the battle
      field and in society

19:17.323 --> 19:21.359
     as an example of what
        a man should be.

19:21.361 --> 19:24.328
     Protectors of the weak
        and defenseless,

19:24.330 --> 19:29.333
 and warriors against monsters
   who threatened this land.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.252
             Lame!

19:31.253 --> 19:33.170
 You know, that's what all the
     wannabe knights said.

19:33.173 --> 19:37.175
    They were too busy being
monsters instead of protectors.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.777
            Maybe...

19:38.778 --> 19:40.378
  If a knight broke this broke
      this code of conduct

19:40.380 --> 19:42.063
   it was considered treason.

19:42.064 --> 19:43.747
     No wonder they're not
         around anymore

19:43.750 --> 19:46.250
      Actually, they are.

19:46.252 --> 19:49.253
 But they're knights in titles
      rather than armor.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.422
      But even though the
         armor is gone,

19:51.424 --> 19:56.494
a knight's ideals should always
       remain in fashion.

19:59.199 --> 20:03.367
History is always in the making.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.204
 And what will your history be?

20:07.207 --> 20:09.440
          [bell rings]

20:12.278 --> 20:14.512
     Way to stay under the
         radar Ashley.

20:19.219 --> 20:23.221
  Thank-you for participating
         today Ashley.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.223
          No problem.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.458
       You know, I've put
       together a list of

20:27.460 --> 20:29.460
       upcoming projects
         for the year.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.462
        The biggest one
         is called the

20:31.464 --> 20:33.564
        'History in Your
         Life' project.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.466
             Okay.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.668
   It's a video presentation
  about some event in history

20:37.670 --> 20:40.238
         and how it has
      affected your life.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.472
         Wait, my life?

20:41.474 --> 20:45.476
   Mm hmm. The details about
       it are right here.

20:45.478 --> 20:49.313
         Okay. Thanks.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.317
   I tracked down this virus
    from my aunt's computer.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.353
   It's meant to intrude and
      collect information

20:55.355 --> 20:56.955
        and send it back
         to the sender.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.556
  Yeah, I found out where the
     source is coming from.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.724
        Check that out.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.592
      That's pretty cool.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.561
Oh, watch it.

21:03.563 --> 21:06.464
        Nick! Be careful
        with my laptop.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.032
       Yeah it would have
        fried it right?

21:08.034 --> 21:10.451
     Would you cut it out?

21:10.452 --> 21:12.869
    Oh, look Max, it's your
    knight in shining armor.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.506
    I'm sorry, in what world
     is this actually cool?

21:15.508 --> 21:19.310
  Didn't you push enough kids
    around on the playground
         ten years ago?

21:19.312 --> 21:22.747
          Yeah, well,
         later losers.

21:28.354 --> 21:30.454
       Hey.
                    Hi.

21:30.456 --> 21:33.324
Have you met a girl
named Angie yet?

21:33.326 --> 21:36.560
                  Uh, no I don't
                  think so.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.462
Somebody dropped
out of the play.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.299
I was thinking about using
her as a replacement.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.533
                Yeah? What role?

21:42.535 --> 21:47.371
Olivia. We're doing
Twelfth Night.

21:47.373 --> 21:49.540
You'd be such a
great Olivia.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.343
It's not even the
starring role.

21:52.345 --> 21:56.447
          Mom, I don't have time
          in my class schedule
          for drama, okay?

22:05.558 --> 22:07.792
This is incomplete.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.760
            Well I don't get it.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.330
Well maybe if you spent
less time goofing off
with your friends

22:12.332 --> 22:15.399
and more time actually paying
attention you'd understand.

22:15.401 --> 22:19.637
Now I want you to take it
home and try again. Go on.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.450
        Hey that's mine.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.852
                            Hey!

22:35.555 --> 22:38.622
      Here's where you're
       getting it wrong.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.424
      That should be 'y'.

22:40.426 --> 22:43.361
     You're making the same
   mistake on every problem.

22:53.606 --> 22:56.374
         Mr. Carlisle.

22:56.376 --> 22:59.577
          Mrs. Tanner,
        what a surprise.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.846
    I heard something about
     weapons in your class

23:01.848 --> 23:03.881
    and a stabbed mannequin.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.550
         What? Oh that?

23:06.552 --> 23:08.853
It was a plastic sword. Is that
   what you're talking about?

23:08.855 --> 23:10.388
   Are there more than that?

23:10.390 --> 23:11.956
      Oh there's an army.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.391
   And what's with the armor?

23:13.393 --> 23:15.476
    It's part of my lesson.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.560
   I can appreciate a little
    devotion to your subject

23:17.563 --> 23:19.630
     but some common sense
         would be good.

23:19.632 --> 23:22.433
 Swords real or fake, they can
    send the wrong message.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.402
         And a suit of
        armor is heavy.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.636
        Well I'm the one
          wearing it.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.638
      It can be used as a
         weapon itself.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.057
    Well so can a textbook.

23:30.058 --> 23:32.475
    But at some point you're
    going to have to have a
   little faith in humanity.

23:32.478 --> 23:36.414
   I'm only responding to the
    concerns of our students
       and their parents.

23:36.416 --> 23:39.483
  Well tell them to beware of
 all those dangerous textbooks.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.419
     They have sharp edges.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.487
         Yeah, I will.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.826
                     Hi.

23:48.828 --> 23:51.429
           Hi.

23:51.431 --> 23:52.696
         Need a break?

23:53.699 --> 23:56.567
So Mrs. Tanner's not a fan, huh?

23:56.569 --> 24:00.604
  I can't blame her. I know my
     methods are out there.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.673
            You do?

24:03.509 --> 24:09.780
  Sorry, I mean you just seem
    so caught up sometimes.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.816
  I've always been fascinated
          by history.

24:11.818 --> 24:15.052
     I mean, we read these
      emotionless passages

24:15.054 --> 24:18.656
  out of these textbooks about
   some battle or some event.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.624
       But if you really
        think about it,

24:20.626 --> 24:23.994
    you have to be there to
    understand the context.

24:23.996 --> 24:28.899
 You know? People's lives were
   affected from the outcome.

24:28.901 --> 24:31.969
    You're really passionate
        about this, huh?

24:31.971 --> 24:37.808
 Yeah, well, my passion drives
   my administration insane.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.812
  I don't follow the book from
    front to back, you know.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.515
      I'd rather focus on
           the topic.

24:44.517 --> 24:45.749
          The message.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.618
            Message?

24:47.620 --> 24:51.822
  Yeah, the real message that
     history can teach us.

24:51.824 --> 24:55.559
      History is not just
     about dates and facts.

24:55.561 --> 24:58.929
 The real lesson in history is
what we can learn in hindsight.

24:58.931 --> 25:02.566
   That way kids can take it
       and personalize it

25:02.568 --> 25:05.703
  and figure out how they feel
        about it today.

25:05.705 --> 25:10.541
     Wow. I can certainly
     understand why Ashley
   enjoys your class so much.

25:10.543 --> 25:11.709
            Ashley?

25:11.711 --> 25:14.645
    Yeah, she's my daughter.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.680
     She just doesn't like
        people to know.

25:16.682 --> 25:19.784
  You're last name is Johnson.

25:19.785 --> 25:22.887
   Yup. Well, she changed her
   name back to her father's
      a little while ago.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.955
              Oh.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.562
      Math?

25:31.564 --> 25:32.930
                   Science.

25:32.932 --> 25:35.850
      Any good?

25:35.851 --> 25:38.769
   Yeah, well if you consider
    chemical equations to be
        good then sure.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.640
     Want to watch a movie?

25:44.744 --> 25:46.810
          Can I pick?

25:50.816 --> 25:54.852
  <i> Yeah, well, you promised me</i>
   <i> skiing, so... On slopes!</i>

26:00.593 --> 26:02.660
<i> Well you never specified that,</i>
        <i> and besides...</i>

26:06.699 --> 26:08.032
             Julie!

26:08.034 --> 26:09.033
                      Hi.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.101
          Sorry... Hi.

26:13.606 --> 26:17.341
     I really wanted to ask
        you if I, um...

26:17.343 --> 26:20.010
   if you could maybe, um...

26:20.012 --> 26:22.680
      give me your dress?

26:24.050 --> 26:27.785
      No, no, the costume
      from the other day.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.921
         Oh, yeah sure.

26:30.923 --> 26:35.626
   Great, thank-you. Oh, can
       I borrow you too?

26:35.628 --> 26:37.695
           Excuse me?

26:37.697 --> 26:40.631
   Okay, I need a volunteer.

26:40.633 --> 26:41.599
               Look at this one.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.834
Carrie!

26:49.942 --> 26:53.677
     Carrie, can you stand
       over here please?

26:54.981 --> 26:59.950
 Okay, Carrie. Now imagine you
 see this really handsome guy.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.820
  That shouldn't be too hard.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.855
        How would you go
       about meeting him?

27:04.857 --> 27:07.091
  Easy, go up and talk to him.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.928
  What if you weren't allowed?
 Let me show you how it's done.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.998
      Max, can you come up
          here please?

27:16.636 --> 27:20.771
  All right. Max, come on over
      here and stand here.

27:20.773 --> 27:22.740
 According to society's rules,

27:22.742 --> 27:26.076
         a woman could
     not even talk to a man

27:26.078 --> 27:28.746
         unless she was
      formally introduced.

27:28.748 --> 27:33.917
    So, my lady Carrie may I
        introduce you to

27:33.919 --> 27:36.987
       Maximillian of the
       house of Bentley.

27:36.989 --> 27:40.758
      Max, bow to Carrie.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.860
     Good. Carrie, curtsy.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.662
             What?

27:47.166 --> 27:50.834
        Good, very good.
        Ok, have a seat.

27:50.836 --> 27:55.706
       Now, that was just
       meeting a person.

27:55.708 --> 27:58.676
Now can you imagine
 courtship, dating?

27:58.678 --> 28:02.813
          Nice curtsy.

28:02.814 --> 28:06.949
  Back in the early days, the
 only way that a man could meet
    a woman was at a dance.

28:06.952 --> 28:13.023
   Dancing was the one place
  for true interaction between
       a man and a woman.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.959
  And it would work something
         like this...

28:15.961 --> 28:19.763
     A woman would receive
         a dance card.

28:19.765 --> 28:24.168
A man would then write his name
    down on this dance card

28:24.170 --> 28:27.171
       and at the end of
     the evening the woman

28:27.173 --> 28:33.043
      would review who she
      danced with and who
       she like the best.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.312
    Now, if you guys aren't
   familiar, I would like to

28:35.314 --> 28:40.217
    introduce our new drama
      teacher Ms. Johnson.

28:40.219 --> 28:43.287
She's going to help demonstrate
    these traditional dances

28:43.289 --> 28:45.756
 which we will then all learn.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.792
 Now I'm not talking about the
    fast paced sweaty stuff

28:48.794 --> 28:50.861
    that you guys do today.
        You know the...

28:51.731 --> 28:53.197
       [students chuckle]

28:53.199 --> 28:55.999
        What I'm talking
       about is dancing.

28:56.001 --> 29:02.005
  Okay, so, with dancing there
    was real communication.

29:02.007 --> 29:04.108
    There was no asking each
       other out by texts

29:04.110 --> 29:06.243
         or poking each
       other on Facebook.

29:06.245 --> 29:10.948
  It was just man and a woman,
         face to face.

29:10.950 --> 29:18.989
With dancing... dancing was the
 first time that it allowed you
    to hold a woman's hand.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.958
          Like so...

29:20.960 --> 29:28.365
  Dancing allowed for intimate
         closeness...

29:28.367 --> 29:33.036
   and private conversation.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.107
        [Nick whistles]

29:37.109 --> 29:40.544
Okay, everyone come on up here,

29:40.546 --> 29:43.147
 Now we're all going to try it.

29:45.985 --> 29:50.120
You know, Mr. Carlisle, I can't
 really risk injuring myself in
      the off season, so--

29:50.122 --> 29:52.122
  If you injure yourself doing
      this then I'd highly

29:52.124 --> 29:54.558
       reconsider calling
      yourself an athlete.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.794
       All right, come on
      guys let's pair up.

29:56.796 --> 30:00.931
 Nick and Ashley, Max and Wei,
      Brenna and Patrick.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.800
          Come on up.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.803
         [Music plays]

30:05.805 --> 30:09.573
   All right, everyone ready?
 Grab your partners like this.

30:09.575 --> 30:12.943
         And follow us.

30:13.212 --> 30:17.981
  Now back in civil war times
dancing was enjoyed by everyone.

30:17.983 --> 30:22.152
  It was a way to forget about
 the conflict and the bloodshed
      for a little while.

30:22.154 --> 30:27.191
   Now if you attended a ball
      or a dance you were
       expected to dance.

30:27.193 --> 30:30.294
     The whole point was to
      socialize after all.

30:32.064 --> 30:35.199
   Are you dancing with me or
        somebody else?

30:35.201 --> 30:36.867
            Jealous?

30:36.869 --> 30:39.102
    Don't flatter yourself.

30:40.973 --> 30:43.040
   Can I ask you a question?

30:43.042 --> 30:44.241
             Sure.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.977
   You just moved here right?

30:46.979 --> 30:49.046
     That's your question?

30:52.184 --> 30:55.085
      What makes you think
       that you know me?

30:55.087 --> 31:00.057
 I don't. I know guys like you.

31:00.059 --> 31:03.060
 What's that supposed to mean?

31:03.062 --> 31:06.263
  Nothing. Can we just dance?

31:06.265 --> 31:10.067
      No. I want to know.

31:10.069 --> 31:15.005
  Okay, fine. I know you lame,
 self centered guys who always
      have to be on top.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.875
    You can't go two seconds
  without putting someone else
         down. And why?

31:17.877 --> 31:21.011
Because in some perverse way it
     makes you feel better.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.216
   I'm not all those things.

31:26.218 --> 31:30.087
     Fine, prove me wrong.

31:30.222 --> 31:33.023
 You know what? I don't have to
        prove anything.

31:33.025 --> 31:36.059
       Especially not to
        some loner girl.

31:36.061 --> 31:39.129
       You're right. Who
      cares what I think?

31:39.131 --> 31:43.901
  And one, two, three, four...

31:43.903 --> 31:49.039

  and bow or curtsy. Milady...

 How was the rest of your day?

32:13.265 --> 32:15.649
        Um, it was okay.

32:15.650 --> 32:18.034
 I had a kid cut himself on one
   of the pages of the play.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.137
        Are you serious?

32:20.138 --> 32:22.238
  Bled a lot for a paper cut.
    I had to send him to the
         school nurse.

32:24.009 --> 32:25.976
         What is this?

32:25.978 --> 32:27.322
             What?

32:27.323 --> 32:28.667
         It came here?

32:28.668 --> 32:30.012
   Well I changed our address
     with the post office.

32:30.015 --> 32:32.015
    Yeah, but mom they could
         track us here.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.116
          They can't.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.168
         Are your sure?

32:35.169 --> 32:37.219
They won't track us here, okay?
   They got what they wanted.

What? Are you following me now?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.876
              No.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.378
    Just saw you coming back
   here and I thought I'd see
      what you were doing.

34:08.380 --> 34:13.183
 Just exploring. My old school
didn't have anything like this.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.320
   It's just an old building.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.623
  I mean, nobody really comes
       back here anymore.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.391
       That's fine by me.

34:27.199 --> 34:31.268
        So... kind of a
       loner, aren't you?

34:31.270 --> 34:33.270
     Does it really matter?

34:33.272 --> 34:35.405
              No.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.442
I guess you probably don't have
  a boyfriend though. Do you?

34:38.444 --> 34:42.179
     I'm sorry, how is that
     any of your business?

34:42.181 --> 34:44.481
I guess it's not. I was just...
    because you said you...

34:44.483 --> 34:47.117
           Just stop.

34:47.119 --> 34:51.254
 Okay, fine. I was just trying
    to be nice, or whatever.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.257
   Yeah, well you could use a
     little more practice.

35:02.134 --> 35:04.134
              Why?

35:04.136 --> 35:06.103
           Why what?

35:06.105 --> 35:09.539
     Why are you being nice
        all of a sudden?

35:09.541 --> 35:12.242
 Why does it matter to you now?

35:12.244 --> 35:14.144
          It doesn't.

35:17.249 --> 35:22.185
           Okay, um,

35:22.187 --> 35:28.291
 Everyone around here knows me.
         But you don't.

35:28.293 --> 35:33.430
             So...?

35:33.431 --> 35:38.568
   Well, it's like one minute
you're getting all over my case
and the next you're helping me.

35:38.570 --> 35:41.438
        Am I supposed to
      apologize for that?

35:41.440 --> 35:45.475
         No. I just...

35:45.477 --> 35:48.211
      I don't get why you
       did what you did.

35:48.213 --> 35:50.580
    Look, I helped you with
    your math okay, it's not
      that big of a deal.

35:50.582 --> 35:53.650
   It is that big of a deal.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.386
I mean, I wouldn't have helped.

35:56.388 --> 35:58.455
          Oh, I know.

36:00.292 --> 36:04.294
   I don't know... it was the
       right thing to do.

36:04.296 --> 36:08.398
 Yeah... the right thing to do.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.535
    It doesn't really sound
        like me does it?

36:11.537 --> 36:15.205
  You know, people can change.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.574
 Seriously? People can change?

36:17.576 --> 36:20.443
        Yes, seriously.
       People can change.

36:24.550 --> 36:28.218
      You know Max, right?

36:28.220 --> 36:30.320
           Yeah. So?

36:30.322 --> 36:32.255
  Why aren't you nicer to him?

36:32.257 --> 36:34.624
    I'm plenty nice to Max.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.793
       Oh no you are not.

36:36.795 --> 36:43.533
       Okay, okay. Um...

36:43.535 --> 36:48.305
  Me and Max grew up together.
   We were actually friends.

36:48.307 --> 36:51.408
    Then he started getting
    into all this tech stuff
       and I don't know.

36:51.410 --> 36:57.280
 That's not really how I roll,
      so, we drifted apart

36:57.282 --> 37:02.319
  I mean, it's like you said,
         people change.

37:02.321 --> 37:07.724
 Yeah but there's a difference
 between changing and changing
        for the better.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.829
  Well, that's it for today.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.265

        want you to do:

I want you to pick a place that
has history. Any place at all.

          a monument.

37:25.377 --> 37:29.479
  Go there and write about it
   and what it means to you.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.648
  Um, how long does the paper
          have to be?

37:31.650 --> 37:33.250
    Just two or three pages.

37:33.252 --> 37:34.017
              Ugh.

37:34.019 --> 37:35.485
You can make it longer.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.620
          Yeah, right.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.488
          [bell rings]

37:38.490 --> 37:40.323
         Due next week

37:50.269 --> 37:52.369
           Oh, sorry.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.671
           Go ahead.

37:54.673 --> 37:57.274
            Thanks.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.615
          I could have sworn my
          keys were in my purse.

38:05.617 --> 38:06.883
Did you check your
  school stuff?

38:06.885 --> 38:09.319
            Yeah, I already did.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.321
When did you see
   them last?

38:11.323 --> 38:15.725
  Yesterday. I came home, put
        my purse down...

38:15.727 --> 38:17.427
   And what did you do next?

38:17.429 --> 38:20.497
    Uh, what did I do? I...

38:20.499 --> 38:25.502
   I got something to drink,
        I paid the rent,

38:25.504 --> 38:27.404
          made dinner.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.373
          Found them.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.544
    By the spaghetti sauce.

38:34.546 --> 38:39.649
Of course. Any special requests?

38:39.651 --> 38:42.552
       Chips and cereal.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.087
       Of course. Okay.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.588
          Thanks mom.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.459
              Hi.

38:49.461 --> 38:55.632
    Hi. Um, Is Ashley here?

38:57.469 --> 39:00.570
    What are you doing here?

39:00.572 --> 39:05.408
 Um, I was just going to go do
    that history assignment.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.744
       Have you started?

39:07.746 --> 39:10.347
            Um, no.

39:10.349 --> 39:14.417
     Well, I had a place if
       you wanted to go.

39:14.419 --> 39:19.356
 Sounds good. Yeah, you should
 get out, You should get out a
       little bit today.

39:19.358 --> 39:23.626
   Uh, I'll go get my shoes.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.735
     Was that Ms. Johnson?

39:31.737 --> 39:34.537
             Yeah.

39:34.539 --> 39:39.509
  So Ms. Johnson is your mom?

39:39.511 --> 39:46.583
      Yes. But, don't tell
         anybody okay?

39:46.585 --> 39:47.817
             Okay.

39:47.819 --> 39:50.420
            Thanks.

39:50.422 --> 39:54.524
So, Carrie didn't want to come?

39:54.526 --> 39:57.527
    No, she had other plans.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.696
        She won't mind?

39:59.698 --> 40:04.667
 No. I mean, it's not like this
     is a date or anything.

40:04.669 --> 40:07.737
       It better not be.

40:14.646 --> 40:19.482
     This place is so cool.
      You come here a lot?

40:19.484 --> 40:23.853
 It's the first time. I usually
  just see the planes from the
             road.

40:23.855 --> 40:27.824
 It's the first place I thought
  of when Mr. Carlisle gave us
        the assignment.

40:29.895 --> 40:34.764
     So, what's your story?

40:34.766 --> 40:36.533
           My story?

40:36.535 --> 40:40.603
   Yeah, I mean, I don't know
        much about you.

40:40.605 --> 40:43.206
Other than the fact that you're
        kind of quiet.

40:43.208 --> 40:48.878
   At least until you get mad
anyway. Where did you move from?

40:48.880 --> 40:53.783
       Uh, a small town a
        few hours away.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.919
Did your mom or dad change jobs?

40:55.921 --> 40:58.888
          Not my dad.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.592
      So, with your mom.

41:02.594 --> 41:03.793
             What?

41:03.795 --> 41:05.528
           Your mom.

41:05.530 --> 41:07.764
      Taking over for the
         drama teacher.

41:07.766 --> 41:10.767
           Oh, yeah.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.504
          That sucks.

41:14.506 --> 41:17.073
 Changing schools in the middle
          of the year.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.576
   Do you miss your friends?

41:20.879 --> 41:22.846
         I'm adjusting.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.652
           It's cool.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.855
     My mom's grandpa flew
         one of these.

41:31.857 --> 41:32.822
             Yeah?

41:32.824 --> 41:34.958
            Uh huh.

41:34.960 --> 41:38.495
Uh, B-17.

41:38.497 --> 41:40.830
               Flying fortress.

41:40.832 --> 41:44.834
World War One.

41:44.836 --> 41:48.838
                     Wait, what?

41:48.840 --> 41:50.840
World War two?

41:50.842 --> 41:56.646
     Uh, yeah, they didn't
    exactly have planes like
     this in World War One.

41:56.648 --> 42:01.651
    Yeah, well history isn't
        my best subject.

42:04.956 --> 42:08.625
  Did he ever see any action?

42:08.627 --> 42:13.563
    Yeah, he was flying over
 Germany when he was fired on.

42:13.565 --> 42:14.731
            No way!

42:14.733 --> 42:15.899
             Yeah!

42:15.901 --> 42:17.534
        What did he do?

42:17.536 --> 42:20.603
      It tore through the
          whole side,

42:20.605 --> 42:24.641
          trapping one
    of his crew in the tail.

42:24.643 --> 42:29.812
  He had five of his men bail
    just in case he couldn't
     land the plane safely.

42:29.814 --> 42:33.850
    And the rest of the men
   used their own parachutes
      to hold the tail on.

42:36.154 --> 42:39.155
        Were they okay?

42:39.157 --> 42:43.693
      Yeah, he landed the
         plane safely.

42:43.695 --> 42:46.896
      Well, what was left
         of the plane.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.866
 They gave him a medal for it.

42:49.868 --> 42:52.602
       Is he still alive?

42:52.604 --> 42:54.771
             No...

42:54.773 --> 42:58.708
  Not many from that time are.

42:58.710 --> 43:02.912
Wow. That's a really cool story.

43:02.914 --> 43:06.716
     It's not just a story.

43:06.718 --> 43:09.852
      It really happened.

43:26.605 --> 43:27.804
       Thanks for today.

43:27.806 --> 43:29.706
             Yeah.

43:32.377 --> 43:35.878
     Why did you ask me to
          go with you?

43:35.880 --> 43:40.049
  I don't know. I just thought
       you might like it.

43:40.051 --> 43:44.020
       I did. So, thanks.

43:45.757 --> 43:46.923
       See you at school.

43:46.925 --> 43:49.058
     Yeah. Don't forget to
       write your paper.

43:49.060 --> 43:50.893
            I won't.

43:50.895 --> 43:54.030
In fact I think I know what I'm
   going to write on already.

44:00.038 --> 44:03.673
<i>Her great-grandfather saved the</i>
    <i> plane and the men in it.</i>

44:03.675 --> 44:06.776
  <i> To me it used to be some war</i>
   <i> that happened years ago. </i>

44:06.778 --> 44:11.681
   <i> But to others it's a real</i>
    <i> event. That changes your</i>
          <i> perspective.</i>

44:11.683 --> 44:14.851
   <i> Just like seeing that B-17</i>
    <i> changed my perspective. </i>

44:14.853 --> 44:19.055
    <i> It wasn't just a story.</i>
        <i> It was history.</i>

44:26.431 --> 44:27.864
          Well hello.

44:27.866 --> 44:30.733
     What brings you here?

44:30.735 --> 44:33.870
       Just basking in a
       moment of triumph.

44:33.872 --> 44:37.707
 One of my students is finally
      starting to get it.

44:37.709 --> 44:39.108
           Oh, who?

44:39.110 --> 44:40.910
         Nick Thomas.

44:40.912 --> 44:43.112
           Very good.

44:43.114 --> 44:45.982
  You know him and Ashley have
    been hanging out lately.

44:45.984 --> 44:47.283
       Is he a good kid?

44:47.285 --> 44:49.152
       He has potential.

44:49.154 --> 44:50.820
       He's spending time
       with my daughter,

44:50.822 --> 44:53.690
    I'm asking as a mother.

44:53.692 --> 44:54.891
       He has potential.

44:54.893 --> 44:56.926
        [hissing sound]

44:56.928 --> 44:59.762
   What the... what is this?

44:59.764 --> 45:03.132
A fog machine. I use it in some
    of the plays that I do.

45:04.069 --> 45:06.887
    You know I'm just being
      careful, you know?

45:06.888 --> 45:09.706
 What kind of mother would I be
  if I let my daughter go out
       with just anyone?

45:11.843 --> 45:13.710
            Kevin?

45:14.045 --> 45:15.111
     Hey, you want a drink?

45:15.113 --> 45:16.813
          Yeah, sure.

45:16.815 --> 45:18.715
All right, what can I get you?

45:18.717 --> 45:21.284
     Well, diet something.

45:21.286 --> 45:25.288
 Sheila's got me back on one of
her losing weight schemes again.

45:25.290 --> 45:28.958
            Oh boy.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.727
    All right, there you go.

45:30.729 --> 45:31.060
           Thank-you.

45:31.062 --> 45:33.029
            Mm hmm.

45:40.872 --> 45:46.008
Washington's army was a rag-tag
   group of British soldiers.

45:46.010 --> 45:51.814
      They didn't have the
   training, the food, or the
   equipment of the British.

45:51.816 --> 45:57.019
    So three months prior he
     issued a general order
       to his commanders.

45:59.357 --> 46:02.792
    "Instant to be observed.

46:02.794 --> 46:05.828
     "As a day of fasting,
    humiliation and prayer,

46:05.830 --> 46:09.132
   "humbly to supplicate the
     mercy of Almighty God,

46:09.134 --> 46:14.003
   "that it would please and
    pardon all manifold sins
       and transgressions

46:14.005 --> 46:17.240
  "and to prosper the arms of
      the United Colonies,

46:17.242 --> 46:21.244
"and finally establish the peace
    and freedom of America,

46:21.246 --> 46:25.848
    upon a solid and lasting
          foundation."

46:25.850 --> 46:28.251
  Hey, wait, wait, wait. This
      isn't church, dude.

46:28.253 --> 46:30.019
     An astute observation.

46:30.021 --> 46:32.789
 What's with all the God stuff?

46:32.791 --> 46:34.857
    I'm quoting Washington.

46:34.859 --> 46:40.096
Religion was a part of life and
  therefore a part of history.

46:40.098 --> 46:45.001
    Now, the British and the
 Americans were building their
forces to battle on Long Island,

46:45.003 --> 46:50.573
    and it appeared that the
   British were going to beat
      the Americans badly.

46:50.575 --> 46:53.209
The British sent there ships to
    cut off an escape route.

46:53.211 --> 46:55.211
                       Sorry.
  It's okay.

46:55.213 --> 46:56.946
     All they had to do was
      trap Washington and
      make him surrender,

46:56.948 --> 46:59.248
    and the whole revolution
         would be over.

46:59.250 --> 47:03.119
  Think of the despair in the
American troops must have felt.

47:03.121 --> 47:05.054
     Was God against them?

47:05.056 --> 47:10.026
 Was their whole fight in vain
 now? Think of your own lives.

47:10.028 --> 47:12.895
  Have you ever had something
        challenge you?

47:12.897 --> 47:16.199
   Made your life completely
          unbearable?

47:16.201 --> 47:20.903
    Did you think it was the
       end of the world?

47:20.905 --> 47:25.074
 Well, it wasn't the end of the
     world for Washington.

47:25.076 --> 47:29.145
       He made his troops
        ready to escape.

47:29.147 --> 47:32.048
But in daylight on that island,

47:32.050 --> 47:36.118
  the British could easily see
     them and corner them.

47:38.623 --> 47:41.891
      But then a fog came.

47:41.893 --> 47:46.162
  It came and stayed until the
    sunlight came up and hid

47:46.164 --> 47:53.002
  the American troops and they
       escaped unnoticed.

47:53.004 --> 48:00.243
        Because of this
   fog the American cause was
       saved once again.

48:03.915 --> 48:08.084
  See, history teaches us that
     we can't just despair.

48:08.086 --> 48:10.253
       Hope may yet come!

48:10.255 --> 48:14.123
  Better things may lie ahead!

48:14.125 --> 48:16.926
   History is in the making!

48:16.928 --> 48:18.995
   What will your history be?

48:24.936 --> 48:25.935
                           Hey.

48:25.937 --> 48:27.303
          Clumsy much?

48:36.014 --> 48:39.115
       So that's where my
       fog machine went.

48:39.117 --> 48:41.183
             Sorry.

48:42.053 --> 48:44.687
      But it added to the
      ambiance perfectly.

48:44.689 --> 48:47.056
           Ok, good.

48:48.059 --> 48:51.093
      I should have asked.

48:51.095 --> 48:52.361
 I'm not surprised you didn't.

48:52.363 --> 48:57.400
     Oh, I know, I do have
        to work on that.

48:57.402 --> 48:59.268
    All right, you can make
          it up to me.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.137
              How?

49:01.139 --> 49:03.539
   Help me figure out how to
     make this scene work.

49:03.541 --> 49:05.308
      What happens in it?

49:05.310 --> 49:09.278
          It's a scene
    where Viola in disguise,

49:09.280 --> 49:12.381
   tells Orsino about a young
 woman who loves a man so much

49:12.383 --> 49:14.183
      but doesn't know how
          to tell him.

49:14.185 --> 49:16.185
   So what direction are you
   thinking about taking it?

49:16.187 --> 49:19.121
    I don't know. I need to
   find a way to balance the
     romance and the humor,

49:19.123 --> 49:24.327
  I mean, this is Viola almost
 declaring her love for Orsino
    and yet he has no idea.

49:24.329 --> 49:26.429
  So do I keep them together?

49:26.431 --> 49:29.398
             Apart?

49:29.400 --> 49:31.717
         I don't know.

49:31.718 --> 49:34.035
  What if she draws closer to
      him as she speaks--

49:34.038 --> 49:35.204
  And then when she remembers
       she's in disguise

49:35.206 --> 49:37.073
       she sort of starts
      drawing away again?

49:37.075 --> 49:39.108
            Um hmm.

49:39.110 --> 49:40.309
      You want to try it?

49:40.311 --> 49:41.377
           Would you?

49:41.379 --> 49:43.212
   Yeah.
                        Okay.

49:43.214 --> 49:44.747
           What page?

49:44.749 --> 49:47.083
           Page 141.

49:49.387 --> 49:52.221
        "My father had a
     daughter, lov'd a man

49:52.222 --> 49:55.056
as it might be perhaps, I were a
woman, I should your Lordship."

49:55.059 --> 49:57.193
   "And what's her history?"

49:57.195 --> 49:59.228
       "A blank, my lord.

49:59.230 --> 50:01.397
   "She never told her love,
      but let concealment,

50:01.399 --> 50:06.602
  like a worm in the bud feed
      on her damask cheek.

50:06.604 --> 50:12.475
  "She pined and thought, and
    with a green and yellow
     melancholy she sat...

50:12.477 --> 50:16.045
 "like patience on a monument,

50:16.047 --> 50:19.348
       "smiling at grief.

50:19.350 --> 50:23.319
   "Was not this love indeed?

50:23.321 --> 50:28.257
 "We men say more, swear more,

50:28.259 --> 50:33.129
     "but indeed our shows
      are more than will.

50:33.131 --> 50:36.232
      "For still we prove
        much in our vows

50:36.234 --> 50:39.135
    but little in our love."

50:41.639 --> 50:44.440
      Hey mom, I can't the
         keys to the...

50:44.442 --> 50:47.243
     Uh, keys to the house.

50:47.245 --> 50:49.645
 We're just rehearsing a scene.

50:49.647 --> 50:52.515
  Isn't Viola supposed to step
     back there at the end?

50:52.517 --> 50:57.053
    Yeah, and Orsino should
    probably just stay put.

50:57.055 --> 51:00.156
      I'll... I'll wait...
           out, yeah.

51:07.131 --> 51:09.532
     Did you see what that
     Ashley girl's wearing?

51:09.534 --> 51:10.533
             Blah.

51:10.535 --> 51:12.168
      Yeah, and her hair?

51:12.170 --> 51:14.136
             Maxie!

51:14.138 --> 51:15.182
                           Hey!

51:15.183 --> 51:16.227
Texting your mom?

51:16.228 --> 51:17.272
 Let's see what
 we got here?
                   Cut it out.

51:17.275 --> 51:20.443
    Oh, let's buy something.
        That looks good.

51:20.445 --> 51:22.344
 Oops, how about this one next?

51:22.346 --> 51:24.113
 Hey, I love to shop!

51:24.115 --> 51:25.214
             Stop.

51:25.216 --> 51:29.185
     Hmm, I need new shoes.
          Pink maybe?

51:30.688 --> 51:34.190
        Hey. Let him go.

51:34.692 --> 51:37.526
     Hey! I didn't finish.

51:37.528 --> 51:38.694
          You're done.

51:38.696 --> 51:41.097
             Dude?

51:46.204 --> 51:48.370
         What was that?

51:49.440 --> 51:51.440
    You're freaking me out.

51:51.442 --> 51:52.341
         It's nothing.

51:52.343 --> 51:53.342
            Nothing?

51:53.343 --> 51:54.342
 Did you see what you just did?

51:54.345 --> 51:55.711
            Did you?

51:55.713 --> 51:57.146
      I don't know what's
       going on with you

51:57.148 --> 52:00.316
       but just stop it.

52:01.719 --> 52:03.085
              No.

52:03.086 --> 52:04.452
       So you're going to
       turn loser on me?

52:04.455 --> 52:06.188
        Why do you care?

52:06.190 --> 52:10.426
    I don't. I'm not hanging
   around for this new Nick.

52:10.428 --> 52:12.294
         We're through.

52:12.296 --> 52:15.498
    Have fun crying yourself
       to sleep at night.

52:16.434 --> 52:18.334
     I think I'll be okay.

52:21.172 --> 52:24.373
      Okay, those actually
       need to be hemmed.

52:27.211 --> 52:31.280
      So, how are the kids
        liking the play?

52:31.282 --> 52:34.283
     Um... When I sum it up
     for them they like it.

52:34.285 --> 52:37.153
   But the language is a bit
       tricky, you know?

52:37.155 --> 52:40.289
       Have you ever done
       this play before?

52:40.291 --> 52:42.558
       Not as a teacher.

52:42.560 --> 52:45.494
       I did do a role in
      college once though.

52:45.496 --> 52:51.300
  Oh... You should act out the
      scene for them then.

52:51.302 --> 52:54.253
              No.

52:54.254 --> 52:57.205
Why? I dress up and act all the
  time. It will inspire them.

52:57.208 --> 53:00.242
   Yeah? Well maybe I'll save
   inspiration for next year.

53:00.244 --> 53:01.610
I thought you were only staying
   until the end of the year.

53:01.612 --> 53:06.248
 Yeah. Hopefully it works out.

53:06.250 --> 53:09.251
How's Ashley handling the move?

53:09.253 --> 53:14.623
  As well as can be expected.
     She's a good student.

53:14.625 --> 53:17.560
          She's smart.

53:17.562 --> 53:20.529
     I noticed she tries to
       stay quiet though.

53:20.531 --> 53:22.398
             Yeah.

53:22.400 --> 53:26.502
     But she seems like she
       has a lot to say.

53:26.504 --> 53:30.573
Well, we've been through a lot.

53:30.575 --> 53:33.275
            Divorce?

53:33.277 --> 53:37.646
   No... well yeah, but that
      was a long time ago.

53:45.356 --> 53:48.357
       Oh, when was this?

53:48.359 --> 53:51.694
     About five months ago.

53:51.696 --> 53:54.296
   She had a ton of friends,

53:54.298 --> 53:56.232
    she was a great student.

53:56.234 --> 53:58.334
     Well, as great as any
 teenage girl can be who spends

53:58.336 --> 54:03.005
     more time on the phone
      than doing homework.

54:03.007 --> 54:06.308
   But, um, suddenly, I mean

54:06.310 --> 54:09.578
  completely out of the blue,

54:09.580 --> 54:13.449
 everybody started to hate her.

54:13.451 --> 54:16.585
 She had no idea why so many of
 her friends were pulling away.

54:16.587 --> 54:22.024
     And... Well anyway we
   found this profile online,

54:22.026 --> 54:23.626
    it was linked to all of
          her friends,

54:23.628 --> 54:26.395
   everyone from her school.

54:27.498 --> 54:30.466
     Someone was pretending
           to be her.

54:30.468 --> 54:34.336
    And they were saying all
     these horrible things
     about everybody else.

54:34.338 --> 54:36.739
    And of course everybody
     thought it was Ashley.

54:36.741 --> 54:38.540
        Well who was it?

54:38.542 --> 54:40.509
      Two of my students.

54:40.511 --> 54:41.744
           Two girls.

54:41.746 --> 54:44.313
Were they stopped?

54:44.315 --> 54:46.649
              No.

54:46.651 --> 54:49.885
   Apparently there is a gray
    area in the law between

54:49.887 --> 54:53.722
cyber-bullying and free speech.

54:53.724 --> 54:56.892
  The local police didn't want
        to get involved.

54:56.894 --> 54:59.895
  They said if the accusations
       were true - if...

54:59.897 --> 55:04.333
          that it was
      sad and unfortunate,

55:04.335 --> 55:06.068
   but probably not illegal.

55:06.070 --> 55:07.536
    They didn't believe you?

55:07.538 --> 55:10.406
   It was a really tight knit
        town, you know?

55:10.408 --> 55:12.008
    Even some of the adults

55:12.009 --> 55:13.609
  started hearing what Ashley
    was supposedly saying...

55:13.611 --> 55:15.511
    Absolutely unacceptable!

55:15.513 --> 55:17.613
    She should be suspended
       if I had any say!

55:17.615 --> 55:19.915
     What kind of daughter
        have you raised?

55:19.917 --> 55:22.134
             Wait!

55:22.135 --> 55:24.352
    You should be ashamed of
       yourself and her.

55:25.523 --> 55:27.656
 Lies spread faster than truth.

55:27.658 --> 55:31.327
     And in everyone's mind
     Ashley was guilty. The
      truth didn't matter.

55:31.329 --> 55:36.665
  Kids started shunning her at
  school. Then attacking her.

55:36.667 --> 55:38.934
With what was being said online
 by the other girls it was just

55:38.936 --> 55:40.936
         so much hate.

55:40.938 --> 55:42.938
       How long did this
           go on for?

55:42.940 --> 55:45.574
          Two months.

55:45.576 --> 55:47.376
          What did the
         attorney say?

55:47.378 --> 55:49.345
        It wasn't good.

55:49.347 --> 55:50.879
     We'll just... this is
     going to blow over...

55:50.881 --> 55:53.949
  No, mom, wake up! This isn't
      going to blow over!

55:55.119 --> 55:56.418
            Ashley!

55:56.420 --> 55:58.587
       [screeching tires]

55:58.589 --> 56:02.424
   Ashley begged me to move.

56:02.426 --> 56:05.794
  We left in the middle of the
     night two days later.

56:05.796 --> 56:08.597
      Julie, I'm so sorry.

56:08.599 --> 56:10.599
           Don't be.

56:10.601 --> 56:13.469
    Well, not for me anyway.

56:13.471 --> 56:15.504
    Is there anything I can
          do to help?

56:15.506 --> 56:19.742
   Just be patient with her.
       She's a good kid.

56:19.744 --> 56:23.379
It's just going to take a little
 while for her to open back up.

56:25.149 --> 56:26.648
     Thanks for your help.

56:27.451 --> 56:28.717
     Thanks for the pizza.

56:29.520 --> 56:33.822
        Hey, um, why did
       those girls do it?

56:33.824 --> 56:36.725
       Ashley was cast as
      the lead in a play,

56:36.727 --> 56:39.561
   she used to love theater.

56:39.563 --> 56:42.598
  I even had two other faculty
    members decide on who to
     cast just to make sure

56:42.600 --> 56:45.167
 I wasn't inadvertently giving
     her special treatment.

56:45.169 --> 56:48.837
     But one of those girls
    really wanted the part.

56:48.839 --> 56:52.574
   Wait a minute... All of it
        because of that?

56:52.576 --> 56:56.545
     Hell hath no fury like
        a woman scorned.

56:56.547 --> 56:59.481
       And we're talking
      about teenage girls.

57:04.488 --> 57:06.021
              Hey.

57:06.023 --> 57:07.489
              Hi.

57:07.491 --> 57:09.825
    Um, what are you doing?

57:09.827 --> 57:12.728
       Uh, just studying.

57:12.730 --> 57:14.863
     Well would you like to
         take a break?

57:17.601 --> 57:21.437
           Uh, sure.

57:24.508 --> 57:26.442
      You ready for this?

57:26.444 --> 57:27.743
       Yeah, I guess so.

57:27.745 --> 57:30.045
  You're not scared of heights
      or anything are you?

57:30.047 --> 57:32.481
              No.

57:32.483 --> 57:36.685
 So, what you're going to want
    to do is use these grips

57:36.687 --> 57:39.688
and, well, just climb with your
   legs and try not to fall.

57:39.690 --> 57:41.490
        Okay, this isn't
        rocket science.

57:41.492 --> 57:42.925
  I should be able to manage.

57:42.927 --> 57:44.593
         Want to race?

57:44.595 --> 57:45.894
      Hey that's not fair!

57:55.706 --> 57:57.773
            Oh yeah!

57:58.075 --> 58:00.809
  Okay, you're pretty good at
         rock climbing.

58:00.811 --> 58:03.912
   But, how is your balance?

58:03.914 --> 58:05.881
          My balance?

58:49.860 --> 58:51.927
      [school bell rings]

58:52.129 --> 58:53.529
    So I was at the mall the
      other day and I saw

58:53.531 --> 58:55.931
       these really cute,
        lace, yellow...

58:59.303 --> 59:00.636
              Ugh!

59:11.882 --> 59:13.549
              Hey.

59:13.551 --> 59:14.917
      What's up with you?

59:15.886 --> 59:17.753
Don't give me any of that crap.
       You're not a saint

59:17.755 --> 59:22.324
 so this whole change is what?
            A fake?

59:22.326 --> 59:24.326
Oh wait, are you just trying to
 score with that Ashley chick?

59:24.328 --> 59:26.028
      Hey man... Watch it.

59:26.030 --> 59:27.629
       Then what's really
           going on?

59:27.631 --> 59:28.697
            Nothing.

59:28.699 --> 59:31.250
       Yeah, keep telling
         yourself that.

59:31.251 --> 59:33.802
   You're being a wuss. Don't
    forget who you are man.

59:33.804 --> 59:35.637
            I'm not.

59:35.639 --> 59:37.739
     Maybe I like who I am
   better when I'm with her.

59:40.811 --> 59:44.613
 Scores!            Come on,
                   that wasn't
                      fair.

59:44.615 --> 59:48.884
   Hey do you have any props,
        1770s American?

59:48.886 --> 59:50.836
   Uh, not that I'm know of.

59:50.837 --> 59:52.787
But there's a whole prop closet
I haven't even been through yet.

59:52.790 --> 59:54.056
          Ooh, really?

59:54.058 --> 59:56.191
       Yeah. What are you
      looking for exactly?

59:56.193 --> 59:58.360
     I'm not really sure. I
    haven't found that thing

59:58.362 --> 01:00:01.763
      to really drive home
      an upcoming lesson.

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:05.667
 Well we could go and check it
 out after school if you want.

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:06.935
       That'd be awesome.

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.804
             Okay.

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:12.941
      You are so obvious.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.776
           I am not.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:17.646
  Oh, just get back to class.

01:00:22.019 --> 01:00:24.019
    You get that paper done?

01:00:26.824 --> 01:00:28.624
              Hey.

01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:30.876
            Hi.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:32.994
   So did you hear about that
      party this weekend?

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:37.966
     Oh, I'm not really one
          for parties.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:42.704
     Come on. It'll be fun,
           I promise.

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:46.408
      Uh, okay, we'll see.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.042
            Really?

01:00:47.044 --> 01:00:48.677
             Yeah.

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:50.412
         Okay. See you.

01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:52.814
            See you.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.683
   Hey!
                        Ow!

01:00:54.685 --> 01:00:56.018
      Stay away from him.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.937
              Who?

01:00:57.938 --> 01:00:59.855
      Oh please, he's not
      into girls like you.

01:01:05.796 --> 01:01:08.864
             [¶¶¶]

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:41.029
                    Hey, Ashley.

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:42.698
             Oh hi!

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.298
           You came!

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.766
             Yeah.

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:47.769
      Wow, you look great.

01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:48.904
            Thanks.

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:51.907
Yeah, victory!

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:53.942
            Come on.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:01.850
    So... what do you think?

01:02:01.852 --> 01:02:03.485
      Um, looks like fun.

01:02:03.487 --> 01:02:04.319
             Yeah?

01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:05.254
             Yeah.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:06.188
      Well are you ready?

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:07.189
           For what?

01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:08.056
            To swim.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.791
           Wait! No!

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.733
        Really?

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:20.135
            You looked hot.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:23.972
          Here we are.

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:27.008
     At least it looks more
 promising than the last party.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.143
                  Hey.

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:29.144
           That bad?

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:30.912
      Lame fest.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:33.915
     Ooh, that one's cute.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:36.084
       Whoa Carrie, who's
          your friend?

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:38.954
       Watch it Burnside.
        She's my cousin.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:41.857
     I'm Mel this is Alana.

01:02:43.327 --> 01:02:46.762
    Okay cool. I'll see you
        later probably.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.864
     I'll get your number.
             Maybe.

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:57.372
              Ow.

01:02:57.374 --> 01:02:59.841
        Hey, it was an accident.

01:02:59.843 --> 01:03:00.909
     Sure it was.

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:02.010
                    It was!

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:12.788
          I'm sorry. You okay?

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:13.955
        Yeah.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:16.024
                    Sorry.

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:31.206
              Hey!

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:35.844
              No!

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.247
       That little slut!

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:41.216
              Who?

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:45.921
      Is that...? No way!

01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:48.890
        Look who's here.

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:50.859
            Ashley!

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:53.028
         You know her?

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:02.971
       Hey are there any
        towels anywhere?

01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:07.209
      Uh, sure. Good luck.

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:08.176
            Thanks.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:10.178
                         Nick...

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.179
              Hey.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.447
        We need to talk.

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:14.449
        Yeah, well I'm a
       little wet, so...

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:17.018
     You need to see this.

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:33.869
           Hi Ashley.

01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:36.104
    What are you doing here?

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:38.273
        You didn't move
        far enough away.

01:04:38.275 --> 01:04:40.942
  People still talk about you
       at home you know.

01:04:40.944 --> 01:04:42.210
      About what you did.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:44.479
I didn't do any of those things.

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:48.917
   Yeah, that doesn't really
        matter, does it?

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:50.051
      I can't believe you!

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.220
        HOW COULD YOU?
      YOU RUINED MY LIFE!

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:54.055
          Stop, okay!

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.224
 Look, you got what you wanted.
      Just leave me alone.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:59.094
  But what's the fun in that?

01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:01.963
          Why? Why me?

01:05:01.965 --> 01:05:04.266
  Why not? You got in my way.

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:07.035
     You are so messed up.

01:05:07.037 --> 01:05:09.938
      YOU'RE SO HORRIBLE!
     YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.090
      Well I'm not. Okay?

01:05:12.091 --> 01:05:14.241
 And if you think that you can
blackmail me here, you're wrong.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:19.147
           I didn't think anyone
            would have a reason
             to blackmail you.

01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:21.116
             Nick.

01:05:21.118 --> 01:05:24.185
    This is a very different
          side of you.

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:26.154
             What?

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:28.256
    "Darren gained 15 pounds
       over this weekend

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:31.293
    making out with donuts."

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:33.328
    Did you Photoshop this?

01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:41.102
 "I caught Libby in the closet
 with the janitor. What a ho."

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.104
      "Lisa, if you don't
         get some gum,

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:45.073
       I'm going to start
     Lysoling your mouth."

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:48.009
        That's funny...

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:51.279
 Yeah, it's a very interesting
profile you have here, Ashley...

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.281
            Johnson.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.283
        I didn't say any
        of those things.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.285
           Oh really?

01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:59.286
      You're just going to
      pretend like you had
    nothing to do with this?

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.423
  Do you know how many people
      you hurt back home?

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:04.159
  And now you're trying to do
      it over again here!

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.565
     Nick... please listen.

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:15.170
 No, Ashley. I'm done listening
       to all your crap.

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:17.372
    Okay. You're crap about
        the way I act...

01:06:17.374 --> 01:06:20.475
     make me feel like I've
     done everything wrong.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:24.446
      Yet here you are...
 the biggest hypocrite of all.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:27.315
      Been so busy judging
         everyone else

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:29.017
    you never really stopped
      to look at yourself.

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:31.086
  Nick, you have no idea what
     you're talking about.

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:33.154
      YOU'RE SUCH A FAKE!
        GET OUT OF HERE!

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:35.357
     Yeah, no one wants you
          here anyway.

01:06:37.394 --> 01:06:39.995
        Just go Ashley.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:56.077
    Ashley?

01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:06.421
            Ashley?

01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:10.792
Ashley what happened?

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:13.228
   Did something happen with
         you and Nick?

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:15.797
       Mom just go away.

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:17.999
      Come on, let me in.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.200
     Please mom, would you
      just leave me alone?

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:03.478
      Then she falls in...
    Hey look, there she is!

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:06.481
              So embarassing...

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:08.416
      Should have stayed home...

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:13.488
Watch out.

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:19.127
  Did you see her last night?
        How embarassing.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.500
                          Loser.

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.439
   Hey Ashley.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:33.541
       Are you all right?

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.310
             Yeah.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:37.345
    I saw the video of what
    happened the other day.

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:38.479
       I'm so sorry, I--

01:08:38.482 --> 01:08:40.482
  Your're a ho you know that?

01:08:40.484 --> 01:08:42.367
         Would you just
        leave me alone?

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:44.251
    How could you be so mean
         to my cousin?

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:47.154
  I wasn't. And I'm willing to
    bet that you know that.

01:08:47.157 --> 01:08:50.191
     Yeah, but that's just
          our secret.

01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:51.225
    Hey!

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:52.260
         Next time you
        insult my family

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:56.131
     you better be ready to
        face me. Got it?

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:58.433
Mel said it took her a couple of
months to run you out of town...

01:08:58.435 --> 01:09:01.236
    I'm betting I can do it
      in a matter of days.

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:31.633
          Nice locker!

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.005
  So I wanted the pink ones...

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.339
      I can't believe you
       trashed my locker!

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.506
    I don't know what you're
         talking about.

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:40.375
       Oh, drop the act.

01:09:40.377 --> 01:09:41.720
         It wasn't me.

01:09:41.721 --> 01:09:43.066
    Okay, fine, then you had
     someone do it for you.

01:09:43.067 --> 01:09:44.411
       Maybe, maybe not.
       You'll never know.

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:45.947
 Why are you doing this to me?

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:48.283
      Do I need a reason?
      Now get out of here.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.787
       Yeah, girl fight!

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:54.489
         Get off of me!

01:09:57.394 --> 01:10:02.197
    Stop it! That is enough!

01:10:02.199 --> 01:10:04.632
 I expect better behavior than
   this from the both of you.

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:06.968
  You are the last two girls I
  would expect to be fighting.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.403
   She vandalized my locker!

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:10.338
        I would never do
      something like that!

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.290
          She probably
        did it herself.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:14.241
 Have you seen what she did at
her old school to get attention.

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:15.460
          Oh stop it!

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:16.677
      Look at all the mean
     things she was saying.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.447
         That's a lie.

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:20.215
       Mrs. Tanner, I've
  grown up here. You know me.

01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:22.334
    Does this sound like me?

01:10:22.335 --> 01:10:24.452
   Ashley, I know you're new
    here and your mother was
    sketchy on your history,

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:27.989
   but at my school we don't
    stand idly by while one
     student hurts another.

01:10:27.991 --> 01:10:29.357
      I didn't start this.

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:31.459
 Oh please, you did it before!

01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:34.362
            Ashley!

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:35.697
     What's going on here?

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:09.297
     Max, did you see where
          Ashley went?

01:11:09.299 --> 01:11:10.665
    Yeah, she went that way.

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:12.467
            Thanks!

01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:14.269
     Wait, what's going on?

01:11:16.573 --> 01:11:18.606
            Ashley?

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:22.543
      I'm done. I can't do
         this anymore.

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:28.750
    I spoke to Mrs. Tanner.
     It's going to be okay.

01:11:28.752 --> 01:11:31.486
      Did she believe you?

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:38.293
    See? It's just happening
        all over again.

01:11:38.295 --> 01:11:42.563
        Why? Why is this
        happening to me?

01:11:42.565 --> 01:11:46.334
    I don't know. But we're
      going to fight this.

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:49.370
   Why mom? There's no point.
      Nobody believes me,

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:52.340
       it doesn't matter
          what I say.

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:57.645
      And you know none of
    this would have happened
     if it weren't for you.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.314
    Ashley, that's not fair.

01:11:59.316 --> 01:12:01.349
    No, mom. You're the one
     that was always saying

01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:03.551
   what a good student I was,
        and praising me.

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:06.387
 No wonder they came after me.

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:10.425
  You know if it wasn't you it
 was going to be somebody else

01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:13.494
    You know how many times
       I've wished that?

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:15.663
         I bet you do.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:17.665
       Now you're dating
        Mr. Carlisle...

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:19.600
     are you trying to make
       this worse for me?

01:12:19.602 --> 01:12:20.635
       We're not dating.

01:12:20.637 --> 01:12:23.404
  It sure looks like you are.

01:12:23.406 --> 01:12:27.575
         Look, Ashley,

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:32.747
 if you want to blame me, fine.
      I'm okay with that.

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:36.384
 But better yet blame the girls
    that are at fault here.

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:39.587
      Blame Alana and Mel,
        and now Carrie.

01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:41.656
    If it makes you feel any
   better blame everybody who

01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:44.125
   never believed the truth.

01:12:44.127 --> 01:12:49.564
    I'm sure there's plenty
     of blame to go around.

01:12:49.566 --> 01:12:51.499
      But whatever you do,

01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:56.404
      do not give them the
    satisfaction of tearing
         us apart too.

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:02.710
           I'm sorry.

01:13:05.682 --> 01:13:07.582
             Hey...

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:13.421
           Ashley...

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:18.159
  You know, maybe we shouldn't
        have run before.

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:20.862
   We gave them exactly what
          they wanted.

01:13:20.864 --> 01:13:23.731
  I'm just so tired of it all.

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:27.602
       I know... I know.

01:13:27.604 --> 01:13:30.738
    I don't know what to do.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:34.542
     Well whatever you do,
      whatever you decide,

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:40.748
       if you stay or go,
         fight or run,

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:45.787
      we're going to do it
        together, okay?

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:47.822
             Okay.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.726
   I love you mom.

01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:54.829
               I love you too.

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:00.168
                   It's okay.

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:01.669
  Celebrations and balls were
  early versions of pageants.

01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:03.838
  My mother, aunts and sisters
     all followed tradition

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.807
    to be beautiful winners.
      I'm sure I'll follow

01:14:05.809 --> 01:14:07.775
     in their footsteps and
     become another winner

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.811
   in beauty pageant history.

01:14:19.656 --> 01:14:22.657
     Thank-you Kylie. That
        was interesting.

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:24.892
          [bell rings]

01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:27.695
           Hey Nick,

01:14:27.697 --> 01:14:30.631
    you wanna go see a movie
         later tonight?

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.700
              No.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:33.801
             Nick.

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:34.669
             What?

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:35.837
     Have you seen Ashley?

01:14:35.839 --> 01:14:39.240
    No, and I don't want to.

01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:41.709
      I can't believe you
      think she'd do that.

01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:43.811
         And you don't.

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:45.912
  I know her better than that.
        I don't buy it.

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:47.815
       Okay, well you're
         the only one.

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:49.817
   Look, man, I saw it, I saw
     what she wrote online.

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:52.820
     Just because you heard
    something new about her
  doesn't mean that it's true.

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.722
      Well it doesn't mean
         that it's not.

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:57.525
 Does any of it even sound like
   the Ashley that you know?

01:14:57.527 --> 01:15:00.612
 Okay look, she was pretending.

01:15:00.613 --> 01:15:03.698
     Why? I mean obviously
 people hated her for the crap
       that was written.

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.900
   If it was her why wouldn't
       she take it down?

01:15:05.902 --> 01:15:07.702
         I don't know.

01:15:07.704 --> 01:15:09.504
      My guess is that it
      was a fake account.

01:15:09.506 --> 01:15:12.740
     Okay, look, whatever.

01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:14.926
  You remember that rumor you
       started about me?

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:17.111
 How I put Principal Tanner on
  the FBI's most wanted list?

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:19.280
           Yeah. So?

01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:24.852
    What spread faster? That
  rumor or me trying to say I
         didn't do it?

01:15:26.923 --> 01:15:28.990
   Just give her the benefit
         of the doubt.

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:53.614
It is important. It helps me to
  know what you don't know...

01:15:53.616 --> 01:15:56.684
  ...what we need to focus on.

01:15:56.686 --> 01:15:57.985
If you don't know how to do the
        whole problem...

01:15:57.987 --> 01:16:00.621
   just do the bits you know
           how to do.

01:16:13.636 --> 01:16:15.903
        Can I help you?

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.339
   Um, yeah, is Ashley here?

01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:21.909
    She wasn't feeling up to
         school today.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.911
          Is she here?

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:25.680
        Did she answer?

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:26.914
              No.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.983
          Then no.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:33.588
     Okay look, I just want
        to talk to her.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:03.918
            Yeah...

01:17:05.888 --> 01:17:10.791
     Look... I was stupid.

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:13.995
Okay, I heard some things about
       you and I just...

01:17:13.997 --> 01:17:17.732
   I assumed they were true.

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:22.970
But, I don't know what happened
 to you before you moved here.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.673
   But, if I'm going to hear
         it from anyone

01:17:25.675 --> 01:17:27.642
     I'd rather it be you.

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:29.877
 Well you sure seemed like you
 knew everything at the party.

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:34.882
         I was stupid.

01:17:34.884 --> 01:17:36.851
     You can be mad at me.

01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:38.986
   I mean, obviously you are.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:43.858
       But, if it helps,
        throw it at me.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:49.697
          Feel better?

01:17:49.699 --> 01:17:50.965
              No.

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:57.138
  There's only one thing I can
    think of that'll help.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.006
     Telling everybody off?

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:02.710
      Do you really think
       that they'd care?

01:18:02.712 --> 01:18:05.813
     Maybe. I mean, I did.

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:11.819
     When you called me out
      on being, well, me.

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:20.227
  I just... I've got to leave
       this place behind.

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:24.799
      Thinking of moving?

01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:26.701
           I want to.

01:18:29.172 --> 01:18:31.005
         I don't know.

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:37.912
             Stay.

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:42.850
            Please?

01:18:45.822 --> 01:18:50.024
 You've no idea what I'm going
       to face if I stay.

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:52.059
  I'll be right here with you.

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:54.795
  You said it yourself - you
  don't even know what happened.

01:18:54.797 --> 01:18:58.966
      That doesn't matter.

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:01.736
          I know you.

01:19:17.887 --> 01:19:20.054
       Mine went farther.

01:19:27.764 --> 01:19:28.996
                    Hey.

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:30.231
        Hi.

01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:32.032
    I didn't know you play.

01:19:32.034 --> 01:19:35.102
          Oh, I don't.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:37.972
I just figured my life is pretty
  much a country song anyway.

01:19:37.974 --> 01:19:41.842
    So, might as well learn.

01:19:41.844 --> 01:19:46.113
   Well... I brought you your
 missing homework assignments.

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:48.015
          Gee, thanks.

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:49.917
        You're welcome.

01:19:49.919 --> 01:19:53.954
Oh, and your video presentation
  is due in history tomorrow.

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:57.391
     Oh my gosh, I haven't
     even started on that.

01:19:57.393 --> 01:20:00.261
          Well, would
      you like some help?

01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:03.798
   Hey Max... yeah it's Nick.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.134
So I was wondering if you could
    help us with something?

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:11.806
   Yeah, yeah. We're over at
        Ashley's. Okay.

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:12.873
  He said he'd be right over.

01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:14.942
             Okay.

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:19.146
    I think this could work.

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:20.881
      Yeah, it's perfect.

01:20:20.883 --> 01:20:25.820
    <i> I guess you're innocent.</i>
        <i> Come on... Ahh.</i>

01:20:25.822 --> 01:20:27.855
      Max, this is great!

01:20:27.857 --> 01:20:29.290
          Oh, thanks.

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:31.158
        You sure you can
         pull this off?

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.894
    Hacking into the school
        network is cake.

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:00.054
        Hey. You ready?

01:21:00.056 --> 01:21:02.223
          I think so.

01:21:02.225 --> 01:21:05.860
Don't worry. You're
going to be great.

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:09.230
      Okay, let's do this.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:16.937
           All right.

01:21:16.939 --> 01:21:20.140
   Continuing with our video
         presentations

01:21:20.142 --> 01:21:23.043
    History in your life...

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:24.912
            Ashley.

01:21:31.988 --> 01:21:33.087
           Thank-you.

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:43.097
 Hi, my name is Ashley Johnson.
          Not Evans...

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:45.232
       I changed my name
       when I moved here.

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:47.101
   And I'll get to why later.

01:21:47.103 --> 01:21:48.969
 But the event in history that
      I want to talk about

01:21:48.971 --> 01:21:51.338
        happened in many
      parts of the world.

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:53.374
     It happened over three
      hundred years ago...

01:21:53.376 --> 01:21:55.509
      and resulted in the
    deaths of anywhere from

01:21:55.511 --> 01:21:58.212
        50 thousand to
      100 thousand people.

01:21:58.214 --> 01:22:02.182
 In colonial Masachusetts this
   event started in a village
         called Salem,

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:04.084
       where these girls
      started having fits.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:07.121
    And these fits disturbed
       local authorities.

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:11.225
    What's wrong with these
          crazy girls?

01:22:11.227 --> 01:22:14.295
There's witches, three witches.
    They put a curse on us.

01:22:14.297 --> 01:22:16.196
         Well bring the
         witches here.

01:22:22.204 --> 01:22:24.972
So, you're a witch?

01:22:24.974 --> 01:22:26.273
          No I'm not.

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.943
Too bad. That's the
story we're going with.

01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:30.177
       But it's not true.

01:22:30.179 --> 01:22:33.047
 Well, we'll
 see. Drown her.

01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:36.350
If she floats to the
top and is alive,
she's a witch.

01:22:36.352 --> 01:22:41.055
            What if she survives
            that? Then how do we
            execute her?

01:22:41.057 --> 01:22:42.990
We'll hang her.

01:22:42.992 --> 01:22:46.160
         But what if I
       die from drowning?

01:22:46.162 --> 01:22:50.164
Well then, I guess
you're innocent.

01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:51.332
Come on!

01:22:52.335 --> 01:22:55.102
       [students chuckle]

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:58.272
The girls' accusations led to a
       chain of hysteria.

01:22:58.274 --> 01:23:03.110
  Over 200 people were accused
of witchcraft and 20 were hung.

01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:05.045
   Now the colony eventually
 admitted that the witch trials

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:09.049
        were a mistake.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:13.052
      But you're probably
   wondering how this bit of
  history relates to my life.

01:23:13.055 --> 01:23:17.257
  I used to think that history
      didn't really matter

01:23:17.259 --> 01:23:21.228
      Know that you could
     just forget the past.

01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:23.430
     Ignore it and move on.

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:27.001
       But, where I lived
     before I came here...

01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:29.336
        It wasn't enough
   that I was a good person,

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:33.407
  All it took were those that
 wanted to ruin my reputation.

01:23:33.409 --> 01:23:36.443
        I was accused of
        terrible things.

01:23:36.445 --> 01:23:39.179
    And I did none of them.

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:43.484
      All it took were two
  girls and false accusations.

01:23:43.486 --> 01:23:48.088
   In a matter of days I lost
      most of my friends.

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:52.259
  A couple of my closest ones
 held on for a few more weeks.

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:59.033
 But people were believing the
 lies so much that they started
         attacking me.

01:23:59.035 --> 01:24:01.335
     And other than my mom,

01:24:01.337 --> 01:24:04.238
        I had no one to
         believe in me.

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:11.045
 So, we ran away. And it didn't
 help like I thought it would.

01:24:11.047 --> 01:24:14.214
   And for those of you that
  have heard anything about me
    in the last few days...

01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:17.451
     you already know that.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:21.822
       And if history has
      taught me anything,

01:24:21.824 --> 01:24:26.193
   it's that there are those
 people out there that love to
      watch others suffer.

01:24:26.195 --> 01:24:28.395
 Loyalty fades under pressure.

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:34.068
     And there are very few
   knights out there that are
   willing to fight for you.

01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:37.304
    But they are out there.

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:39.406
       But you know what?

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:44.144
    My past... it isn't the
       end of the world.

01:24:44.146 --> 01:24:46.213
  Better things are in store.

01:24:46.215 --> 01:24:49.283
 I just have to fight for them.

01:24:49.285 --> 01:24:51.452
      So I'm standing up.

01:24:51.454 --> 01:24:54.154
 I'm not going to sit here and
wait for someone to come forward

01:24:54.156 --> 01:24:58.158
   and admit that they made a
   mistake. Enough is enough.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:03.530
  I'm not going to bow down to
  those who get a thrill from
      watching me suffer.

01:25:03.532 --> 01:25:07.367
In Salem, all it took to destroy
  someone that you didn't like

01:25:07.369 --> 01:25:10.170
   was to call them a witch.

01:25:10.172 --> 01:25:14.875
   And today you just make up
        some other lie.

01:25:14.877 --> 01:25:19.313
    Essentially, I have been
   accused of being a witch.

01:25:19.315 --> 01:25:23.484
No matter what I say, the witch
     trials find me guilty.

01:25:23.486 --> 01:25:27.121
   But I know what happened.

01:25:27.123 --> 01:25:29.723
 So, I guess it's up to you to
decide whether you want to think

01:25:29.725 --> 01:25:35.462
    and feel for yourself,
     or wait until I drown.

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:39.466
    History is what you make
          of it right?

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:43.137
    So I'm making sure that
       mine is the truth.

01:25:44.273 --> 01:25:48.542
     [students applauding]

01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:56.650
             [¶¶¶]

01:26:08.631 --> 01:26:11.265
Hi, my name is Ashley Johnson...

01:26:11.267 --> 01:26:13.534
You're a witch!
                 No I'm not...

01:26:13.536 --> 01:26:15.636
        I was accused of
       terrible things...

01:26:15.638 --> 01:26:17.437
     So I'm standing up...

01:26:17.439 --> 01:26:19.273
       Enough is enough!

01:26:19.275 --> 01:26:21.341
    History is what you make
          of it right?

01:26:21.343 --> 01:26:23.477
    So I'm making sure that
       mine is the truth.

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:30.484
   All it took were two girls
     and false accusations.

01:26:30.486 --> 01:26:33.587
   In a matter of days I lost
     most of my friends...

01:26:38.794 --> 01:26:42.496
Do you want to say something to
     me? Say it to my face!

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:46.300
          That's them!

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.426
             So...

01:27:13.462 --> 01:27:17.431
    Now that things are fine
      with you and Ashley,

01:27:17.433 --> 01:27:20.367
     Do you think it would
  crank up the awkwardness if

01:27:20.369 --> 01:27:23.670
 you and I went out on a date?

01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:26.440
        Yes, definitely.

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:36.483
   But she's a strong girl...

01:27:36.485 --> 01:27:40.654
 She can handle it. Besides, I
    think she likes history.
