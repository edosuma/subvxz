00:00.834 --> 00:02.701
<i>You're watching</i>
The Last Man on Earth.

00:02.703 --> 00:04.103
Yes!

00:04.105 --> 00:05.771
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sundays.</i>

00:05.773 --> 00:07.873
<i>And check out</i>

00:07.875 --> 00:09.341
Bob's Burgers--
Whoo!

00:09.343 --> 00:11.543
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
<i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.446
-Can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?
-(sighs)

00:14.448 --> 00:15.581
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:17.350 --> 00:19.118
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man On Earth...

00:19.120 --> 00:20.686
I need to know
what this pill is.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.721
Clozapine.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.056
Uh, Gail, it's a match.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.524
(both laughing, clamoring)

00:25.526 --> 00:26.625
Looks like we have company,

00:26.627 --> 00:28.827
and that company is a Yoda.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.629
TANDY:
Where the hell are you?

00:30.631 --> 00:32.898
(screaming)

00:32.900 --> 00:37.069
(a la Yoda):
Found a Yoda, looks like we did.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.309
I can't believe a kid's alive.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.245
Poor thing,
what he's been through.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.013
Alone all this time.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.149
No family, no friends.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.017
Has he said
anything at all?

00:52.019 --> 00:53.752
Not yet.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.320
TANDY:
Nah, words are just things.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.855
(chuckles)
You guys'll find a way

00:56.857 --> 00:58.323
to bond with him
like I have.

00:58.325 --> 01:01.093
Isn't that right,
you little turkey?

01:02.996 --> 01:04.396
What a connection.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.265
So, look, I know what
you're all thinking.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.067
You know, Tandy's
the finder,

01:08.069 --> 01:10.102
so, naturally, Tandy
should be the keeper.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.403
No one's thinking that.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.671
Yeah, there's no keeper
in this situation.

01:12.673 --> 01:13.672
This is a child.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.075
Or a Benji Buttons.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.210
Okay, if you still think
he's a Benjamin Button,

01:18.212 --> 01:19.845
you shouldn't be
anywhere near him.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.081
Fine, he's a kid.

01:22.083 --> 01:25.117
Look, I put in a lot of hours
out there in those woods,

01:25.119 --> 01:28.520
opening up my heart, and making
him feel the security

01:28.522 --> 01:30.055
that only a father can provide.

01:30.057 --> 01:32.257
Now, am I his literal father?

01:32.259 --> 01:34.526
Probably not.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.196
But am I spiritually his father?
Without a doubt.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.032
So to quote the late
Sir Paul McCartney,

01:40.034 --> 01:41.767
and the even later
Michael Jackson,

01:41.769 --> 01:43.635
"That boy is mine.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.471
That doggone boy is mine."

01:45.473 --> 01:47.272
He doesn't belong
to anybody,

01:47.274 --> 01:48.774
you friggin' nimwood.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.243
Maybe I can help.
From my work with strays,

01:51.245 --> 01:53.812
I learned that the most
important thing you can do

01:53.814 --> 01:56.582
is project a feeling of calm.
Yeah.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.485
You know, just make him
feel comfortable, safe.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.286
Hey, there, little guy.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.955
Hi.
Just relax.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.556
We're all your friends.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.725
Is there anything I can do
to make you more comfortable?

02:06.727 --> 02:09.394
(all talking at once)

02:09.396 --> 02:11.063
Hey, there, my little dude.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.498
You want to take
your mask off?

02:12.500 --> 02:14.666
Okay, nobody takes
that mask off.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.435
He wears that thing
forever, you hear?

02:16.437 --> 02:17.503
Are you hungry?

02:17.505 --> 02:20.939
You want some pizza?

02:20.941 --> 02:22.774
(both gasp)

02:22.776 --> 02:25.310
Well, there's that
beautiful face, huh?

02:26.579 --> 02:28.647
Hey, can you tell us
your name?

02:28.649 --> 02:29.815
Huh?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.116
Oh, he's shy.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.584
Okay, let me start.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.353
My name is Tandy.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.687
Okay, so, uh,

02:35.689 --> 02:38.857
can you tell us
your little name? Huh?

02:41.528 --> 02:43.996
Okay, it appears
we're dealing with a deaf.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.664
Or, like, a Nell.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.932
CAROL:
Okay, let me try.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.334
I'm gonna say
some common names,

02:49.336 --> 02:51.303
and you just let me know
if I guess it.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.438
Daphne.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.806
Smeegle?

02:54.808 --> 02:56.775
LaFontaine.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.644
Carol, those aren't
common names.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.045
Maybe not where you grew up,

03:00.047 --> 03:02.548
but we had two
LaFontaines on our block.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.517
Oh, they were always
picking on poor Smeegle.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.187
LaFontaines are
notorious bullies.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.155
Guys!
His name's labeled right here

03:10.157 --> 03:11.323
on the front of his backpack.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.558
He's Jansport.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.960
No, Tandy, that's the name
of the backpack company.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.628
But it's got a nice ring
to it, huh?

03:16.630 --> 03:18.130
All in favor of naming
the kid "Jansport"?

03:18.132 --> 03:20.966
You can't name
a kid a backpack.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.468
And I would never suggest
that we do that, okay?

03:23.470 --> 03:26.538
But we can be inspired by it.
Okay, let's brainstorm:

03:26.540 --> 03:28.473
Jan, Janice...

03:28.475 --> 03:30.008
Oh, I like Janice.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.176
Janice it is.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.145
No, you're not
naming him Janice.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.513
Guys, look, he's obviously
got a name,

03:34.515 --> 03:35.814
and he'll tell us
when he's ready.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.650
But in the meantime,
we have to call him something.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.885
I mean, kids need names.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.321
It gives them confidence,
self-esteem.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.389
Half the kids in jail
never had names.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.857
That's why they
give them numbers.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.160
Ooh, how about Jansport?

03:48.162 --> 03:49.394
Oh, we already did that one.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.996
Uh, Jasport! Jasport.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.732
Uh, Japort, Japah...
Jasper. Jasper!

03:53.734 --> 03:55.567
Jasper-- what do you think?

03:55.569 --> 03:56.501
Fine.

03:56.503 --> 03:57.402
Is that okay?

03:57.404 --> 03:58.503
Can we call you Jasper?

04:00.340 --> 04:01.240
He loves it.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.674
Hi, Jasper.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.176
Hey, you want to play a game?

04:04.178 --> 04:06.178
You do, huh?
Tag!

04:06.180 --> 04:07.679
(laughing)

04:16.055 --> 04:18.223
Hey, bud.
(chuckles)

04:18.225 --> 04:20.459
It's good to get away
from those chumps, huh?

04:20.461 --> 04:24.296
Just the boys, am I right?
(chuckling)

04:26.099 --> 04:27.266
Psych!

04:27.268 --> 04:29.134
Too slow, yeah.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.902
Hey, I got a little
something for you.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.371
Hang tight.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.311
(engine humming)

04:52.158 --> 04:54.326
Jasper?

04:55.628 --> 04:58.497
Jasper?

04:58.499 --> 04:59.498
Huh.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.800
(turning siren on and off)

05:03.569 --> 05:04.970
(laughs)

05:08.341 --> 05:09.608
Well, there you are,

05:09.610 --> 05:12.611
you little, turkey, huh?
(chuckling)

05:12.613 --> 05:14.579
Guess we're gonna have to
work on the meaning

05:14.581 --> 05:17.082
of "hang tight,"
'cause you immediately took off.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.084
(chuckles) No worries, bud.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.187
Here, come on, check this out!

05:22.189 --> 05:23.689
(chuckles) Look at this.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.257
Isn't this cool?

05:25.259 --> 05:27.693
This is called
a margarita pool, Jasper.

05:27.695 --> 05:28.794
Now, margaritas are

05:28.796 --> 05:30.295
an adult beverage

05:30.297 --> 05:31.763
that contain alcohol.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.031
Now, what is alcohol?

05:33.033 --> 05:35.167
Alcohol is what
grown-ups drink

05:35.169 --> 05:38.270
when they want to get crunk;
you know, loose.

05:38.272 --> 05:39.338
Yeah, come over
and check it out.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.639
Oh, no, no, no, no!
(laughs)

05:40.641 --> 05:42.174
This one's for me, okay?

05:42.176 --> 05:44.309
But don't you worry,
'cause I got you

05:44.311 --> 05:46.545
a hot tub sundae!

05:46.547 --> 05:49.781
Come on, Jasper, last one in
is a rotten egg.

05:49.783 --> 05:50.949
(laughter continues)

05:50.951 --> 05:52.517
Oh, very slippery.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.152
(laughs) Come on!

05:54.154 --> 05:55.721
(laughs)

05:55.723 --> 05:58.156
(singsongy):
You're a rotten egg.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.292
JK, bud.
Oh, this is so great.

06:00.294 --> 06:03.028
Look at this, look at this.
I got the whipped cream.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.363
(laughs)

06:04.365 --> 06:07.566
Some peanuts.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.134
And some cherries, too, huh?

06:09.136 --> 06:11.570
(laughs)

06:11.572 --> 06:13.472
This is fun and delicious, huh?

06:16.409 --> 06:18.176
Oh, that whipped cream
has gone bad.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.811
It's gone bad.
Yes, it's rancid.

06:19.813 --> 06:20.879
Where you going, bud?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.148
You gonna get a big run-up?

06:23.150 --> 06:25.384
Gonna cannonball me?
Ha! Nice try.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.985
Jasper. Jasper.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.687
(accordion playing)

06:28.689 --> 06:30.756
♪<i> Crack that whip.</i> ♪

06:30.758 --> 06:32.924
(sighs) Hey, Todd.
Hey.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.025
What are you up to?

06:34.027 --> 06:35.761
Ah, just going to
give Melissa her medication.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.662
Oh. How's that going?

06:37.664 --> 06:40.532
Well, apparently it takes
a few weeks to see results.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.167
But the side effects
are coming in hot,

06:42.169 --> 06:43.168
so that's a good sign.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.936
You know, increased heart rate,

06:44.938 --> 06:47.506
lots of sweats, tarry stools...

06:47.508 --> 06:48.607
Don't need all the deets, Todd.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.275
Copy that.

06:50.277 --> 06:53.345
Hey, thanks again
for your help.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.113
I couldn't have
done it without you.

07:03.222 --> 07:05.190
Hey, bud.

07:05.192 --> 07:08.427
I know this all must
be so new and scary,

07:08.429 --> 07:10.796
but I'd like to introduce you
to a friend,

07:10.798 --> 07:13.031
who might just make you feel
a little more comfortable.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.468
This is Gary.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.303
When I was all alone,

07:18.305 --> 07:20.105
this little guy was
everything to me.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.474
A mother, a father,

07:22.476 --> 07:24.810
a brother, a sister.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.612
A distant uncle who
tells it like it is.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.047
And I'll be honest,
a few days away

07:29.049 --> 07:30.081
from being a lover.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.217
But most of all,

07:32.219 --> 07:34.853
he was my best friend.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.958
Now I'd like him to
be your best friend.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.059
Oh, no, no, no, no!

07:41.061 --> 07:43.628
Erica, stop! Gary!

07:43.630 --> 07:46.198
Gary! No!

07:54.740 --> 07:57.075
I saw what you did
last summer.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.611
What?
You and...

07:59.613 --> 08:01.746
Todd.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.148
Me and Todd what?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.016
The way he touched
your shoulder?

08:05.018 --> 08:07.586
I thought the fireworks
would burn my face off.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.589
Felt like the 4th of May
over there.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.190
You mean 4th of July?

08:12.192 --> 08:16.928
No, the 4th of May--
International Walkers Day.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.998
My family were avid walkers.
Big pedophiles.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.868
Anyways, I thought
you two were broken up.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.202
We are broken up.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.705
Hell, friends can
touch shoulders,

08:26.707 --> 08:28.173
for God sakes, Carol.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.875
Well, looks like this friend was

08:29.877 --> 08:32.978
itching for some benefits.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.146
Carol, why are you all
up in my butt about this?

08:35.148 --> 08:37.382
It's a tale as old as time.

08:37.384 --> 08:40.452
Girl gets stuck in an elevator,
nearly dies.

08:40.454 --> 08:43.989
Comes out scared,
emotional, raw.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.858
And then her scenester
ex-boyfriend swoops in

08:46.860 --> 08:49.895
with his shoulder touches
and his sweet talk.

08:49.897 --> 08:53.231
"Hey, babe, how you feeling?
You feeling raw?

08:53.233 --> 08:54.966
I'll make it go away."

08:54.968 --> 08:56.501
And then you boink all night.

08:56.503 --> 08:59.404
Boink, boink!
Breather. Boink!

08:59.406 --> 09:01.973
And yeah, it's hot,
and it's kinky,

09:01.975 --> 09:04.876
and it's making the voices
in your head stop.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.979
But the next day,
you wake up and he's gone.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.515
And, PS...

09:10.517 --> 09:12.284
(whispers):
you're pregnant.

09:14.921 --> 09:16.988
Yeah, Carol, I don't think
any of those things

09:16.990 --> 09:19.658
are gonna happen,
especially that last part.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.593
Got it.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.195
Oh, God, I don't know
what you think you got,

09:24.197 --> 09:26.765
but you might want to spend
some of the brain time

09:26.767 --> 09:29.267
worrying about Tandy
and that kid.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.902
But they're doing great.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.039
TANDY:
Jasper! Jasper!

09:34.041 --> 09:35.840
How dare you!

09:35.842 --> 09:37.842
Are they?

09:37.844 --> 09:39.578
Jasper!

09:39.580 --> 09:41.346
We're not done here.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.515
He trusted you,
Jasper!

09:43.517 --> 09:46.017
Oh, don't worry, you're
gonna be okay, okay?

09:49.055 --> 09:50.589
How's it going, Tandy?
Not well.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.557
He just needs
a little air transfusion.

09:52.559 --> 09:57.128
Look, I hate to kick you
while you're down here,

09:57.130 --> 09:58.964
but a lot of people
are a little concerned

09:58.966 --> 10:02.033
that you might not have
the aptitude to be a care giver.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.035
Carol, I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.404
I mean, I'm bending
over backwards for this kid,

10:06.406 --> 10:08.373
pulling out all the stops.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.942
But he's just acting
like a real LaFontaine.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.547
Well, if he's misbehaving,

10:15.549 --> 10:17.549
then maybe

10:17.551 --> 10:19.884
you got to do
something about it.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.420
Have you seen
<i>Mr. Holland's Opus?</i>

10:22.422 --> 10:25.924
No.
Me, neither. I hear it's great.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.626
But that same year,
there was another movie

10:27.628 --> 10:30.161
that came out
called<i> Dangerous Minds.</i>

10:30.163 --> 10:31.896
Oh, good, okay.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.898
It's about a woman
named Michelle Pfeiffer,

10:33.900 --> 10:36.635
who marches into
an inner-city classroom,

10:36.637 --> 10:39.638
and for the first time
in the history of the world,

10:39.640 --> 10:43.975
she wins kids over
with stern disciplinarianism.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.444
She just lets her hair down
and puts on

10:46.446 --> 10:48.079
a tight-fitted leather jacket.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.814
She flips
her chair around

10:49.816 --> 10:52.684
and doesn't take any guff.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.486
Do you see at what I'm getting?

10:56.122 --> 10:58.857
Look, I know you want
to be a boy's man,

10:58.859 --> 11:00.792
but I think right now,

11:00.794 --> 11:04.095
you need to be a little bit
more of a Michelle.

11:04.097 --> 11:07.198
Oh, I can be a Michelle.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.503
Well, well, well,
what do we got here, huh?

11:17.376 --> 11:19.844
So you think you're
pretty cool, huh?

11:19.846 --> 11:21.279
Mr. Tough Stuff?

11:21.281 --> 11:24.616
Don't listen to nobody,
no how, huh?

11:24.618 --> 11:26.618
Well I got news
for you, compadre.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.887
There are rules
around here.

11:28.889 --> 11:32.457
Yeah, things that we do
called "rules."

11:32.459 --> 11:34.392
Everyone's got to follow--
w-w-w-wait!

11:34.394 --> 11:36.194
Now, w-wait,
Jasper!

11:36.196 --> 11:38.396
A cigarette?

11:38.398 --> 11:39.397
Give me that.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.532
Where'd this
come from?

11:40.534 --> 11:41.566
J-Jasper!

11:41.568 --> 11:43.468
Where these cigarettes
coming from?

11:43.470 --> 11:44.803
(laughs)

11:44.805 --> 11:46.705
I found it.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.140
The river always
leads to the lake.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.810
Look, I can play your
game all day long.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.045
So what's your next move, huh?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.047
'Cause Tandy
ain't going nowhere.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.582
Consider us
attached to the hip

11:57.584 --> 11:59.484
like a pair of
conjoined twinsies.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.819
You know what those are?

12:00.821 --> 12:02.020
They're twins attached
by the skin.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.254
Wait, wait, wait,
where you going?

12:03.256 --> 12:04.389
(stammers)
Jasper!

12:04.391 --> 12:05.990
Jasper! (stammering)
Don't leave!

12:05.992 --> 12:07.959
Uh... I'll give you
your cigarettes back!

12:09.829 --> 12:12.497
I'll give them back, yeah.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.371
If I give these back to you--

12:20.373 --> 12:23.174
uh,<i> when</i> I give these
back to you,

12:23.176 --> 12:24.442
will-will you do
something for me?

12:25.511 --> 12:26.511
(chuckles)

12:26.513 --> 12:28.379
Like a puppet on a string.

12:28.381 --> 12:29.781
(laughs)

12:35.688 --> 12:37.455
Well, look who's
out and about.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.857
Hey, Melissa.

12:38.859 --> 12:39.858
Oh!

12:39.860 --> 12:41.593
Have you been Jazzercising?

12:41.595 --> 12:43.428
TODD: Oh, no, she just
woke from a nap.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.896
Sweating's one of
the side effects.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.531
And tarry stools.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.967
(sighs) Look, I'd love to
get into that later,

12:48.969 --> 12:51.903
but let me just cut
to the Chase Manhattan.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.873
I've noticed you've been
spending a lot of time

12:54.875 --> 12:56.541
with Mom lately;

12:56.543 --> 12:59.444
touching shoulders and whatnot.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.279
And I just
need to know,

13:01.281 --> 13:03.715
what are your intentions,
Mr. Flores?

13:03.717 --> 13:05.550
Uh, Mr. Flores?

13:05.552 --> 13:08.553
Pedro Flores,
inventor of the yo-yo?

13:08.555 --> 13:10.221
I'm sorry, Carol,
I'm not following.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.458
Do you intend to wrap my mom
around your little finger

13:13.460 --> 13:15.160
and toy with her, hmm?

13:15.162 --> 13:16.895
Do a little down-up, down-up,

13:16.897 --> 13:18.730
maybe walk the dog,

13:18.732 --> 13:20.231
go around the world.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.633
And once you've
had your fun,

13:21.635 --> 13:23.101
stick her in a drawer

13:23.103 --> 13:25.603
with your Pogs and Tamagotchis.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.472
Carol, Gail and I have been
through a lot.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.174
I-I'd never do anything
to hurt her.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.242
Good.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.244
Don't ever try
anything funny, Todd,

13:33.246 --> 13:34.679
'cause I'll be
watching you.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.848
Watching you like a hog.

13:38.851 --> 13:40.485
(snorts)

13:44.423 --> 13:45.757
Evening, everyone.

13:45.759 --> 13:48.193
Oh, hey, Melissa, hey.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.661
(chuckles)
You been Jazzercising?

13:51.096 --> 13:53.097
(chuckles)
Keep it up, looking trim.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.266
Anyway, a little birdie told me
there was a bit of concern

13:55.268 --> 13:56.267
about my parenting skills.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.836
Uh, in light of that,

13:57.838 --> 13:59.337
I just wanted you all to know

13:59.339 --> 14:00.839
that Jasper is dead.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.273
(gasps)
No!
What?

14:02.275 --> 14:04.175
Uh-- sorry, metorically,
not literally.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.678
Idiot.
Could've been a little more
clear about that.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.112
Yeah.
But, yes,

14:08.114 --> 14:10.014
I, you know, I slaughtered
the old Jasper,

14:10.016 --> 14:13.284
I burned his corpse and dumped
his ashes in the toilet.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.387
But like the phoenix,
Jasper is reborn.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.689
And now,

14:17.691 --> 14:19.724
it gives me the greatest
of pleasures

14:19.726 --> 14:22.627
to introduce you
to... the new Jasper!

14:24.330 --> 14:26.731
Jasper, what do we do
when we enter a room?

14:28.367 --> 14:29.968
(chuckles)
What a gentleman.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.402
Have a seat,
please.

14:39.478 --> 14:43.715
Jasper, I was just about to
ask you what we immediately do

14:43.717 --> 14:45.717
upon sitting at
the dinner table,

14:45.719 --> 14:48.219
but looks like you
beat me to the punch.

14:48.221 --> 14:51.389
That's right, we put
our napkins in our laps.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.025
Good job, Jasper.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.827
Good job.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.365
(imitates explosion)

15:00.367 --> 15:01.766
(laughs)

15:01.768 --> 15:04.269
That's right, explosives,
even in fist form,

15:04.271 --> 15:06.004
are only for adults.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.172
I taught him about
the dangers of explosives.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.174
Oh, wow.
Mm-hmm.
GAIL:
Wow. I-I got to say,

15:10.176 --> 15:12.677
you do seem to have made some
progress with the little one.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.879
Thank you, Gail.
Now, Jasper,

15:14.881 --> 15:17.982
what do we say when someone
pays us a compliment?

15:19.685 --> 15:20.685
Aw.
(laughs)

15:20.687 --> 15:22.186
Oh.

15:22.188 --> 15:24.956
Jasper, you're doing so great.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.025
Tandy, what are you
passing Jasper?

15:28.193 --> 15:29.861
Uh... (laughs)

15:29.863 --> 15:32.430
A compliment for
a job well done.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.866
Oh, no, I think I saw you give
him something under the table.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.469
Holy hell,
he's giving him cigarettes.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.038
CAROL: Tandy?
ERICA: Cigarettes?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.639
TODD: You've got
to be kidding me!
What?

15:41.641 --> 15:43.107
Jasper, where'd you get
all those cigarettes?

15:43.109 --> 15:45.143
Oh, come on, Tandy,
we all know where he got them!

15:45.145 --> 15:46.644
Well, then somebody
please tell me

15:46.646 --> 15:48.279
'cause I'm in
the dark here.
Tandy!

15:48.281 --> 15:49.280
What?!
(stammering)

15:49.282 --> 15:50.715
Hello!
Where'd that come from? What?

15:50.717 --> 15:53.484
Jasper, did you put cigarettes
in my shorts pocket?

15:53.486 --> 15:54.919
That's it, Tandy,
I really don't think

15:54.921 --> 15:56.721
you should have anything
to do with this kid.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.456
But we share
a special bond!

15:58.458 --> 16:00.224
Yeah, they're called cigarettes.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.726
But those have nothing
to do with it.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.062
Look, he loves me
like a point person.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.397
Well, then I think it's time
he picks a new point person.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.333
Okay, Jasper.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.902
Now when I say go, you're
gonna walk to the person

16:10.904 --> 16:12.904
you want as your
point person, okay?

16:12.906 --> 16:14.739
And people who
he doesn't go to?

16:14.741 --> 16:15.940
No crying, please.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.475
The system's not rigged.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.178
Okay, you ready?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.347
(whispers):
Look at that.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.582
Tandy, no cigarettes.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.584
Nice try, Gail,
but you can't just

16:26.586 --> 16:28.419
spring a last-minute
rule on me here, right?

16:28.421 --> 16:29.854
Right?
No!
No.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.255
Tandy, no.
CAROL:
Tandy, no.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.257
Okay, fine, fine.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.792
Okay, Jasper, you ready?

16:34.794 --> 16:36.327
And go!

16:36.329 --> 16:38.596
Jasper! Jasper!
Jasp...

16:38.598 --> 16:41.699
Aw, thank you, Jasper.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.267
Okay, round one
goes to Erica.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.702
Uh, best of three.
Come on, get up.

16:44.704 --> 16:45.636
What?

16:45.638 --> 16:46.771
Okay, so where do we stand?

16:46.773 --> 16:48.172
Uh, Erica has 21,

16:48.174 --> 16:50.675
Melissa got a quick three when
Erica went to the bathroom.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.343
Uh, okay, so the
tide turns now.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.878
Here we go, best of 49.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.680
Nope, we're done here.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.048
CAROL:
Tandy,

16:57.050 --> 16:58.616
he picked Erica.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.552
(softly):
Let it go, bud.

17:03.389 --> 17:04.889
I see. Okay.

17:04.891 --> 17:08.359
And, uh, bud, you sure
this is, uh, what you want?

17:13.365 --> 17:15.400
Then so be it, all right?
(laughs)

17:15.402 --> 17:17.802
You're going to
need these, Erica.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.038
Oh!
Tandy!

17:21.373 --> 17:23.541
You know, I should've
named you Brute,

17:23.543 --> 17:26.511
'cause you stabbed me
in the back.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.179
(voice breaking):
The back of my heart.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.247
Oh.

17:35.521 --> 17:36.988
Carol,

17:36.990 --> 17:39.891
what in high
heaven did you tell Todd?

17:39.893 --> 17:42.160
I just told him that
if he ever messed with you,

17:42.162 --> 17:44.395
I'd give him
the Pilbasian horns.
Carol!

17:44.397 --> 17:48.332
There are two men
left in this Earth.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.101
Just two.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.502
You're married to one of them.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.338
So my options are
pretty limited.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.841
It's Todd or bust.

17:56.843 --> 18:00.278
So if, in the future, I decide

18:00.280 --> 18:03.181
that I want to get back up
on that Todd horse,

18:03.183 --> 18:06.184
then I am gonna get back up
on that Todd horse

18:06.186 --> 18:09.887
and I am gonna freakin' ride!

18:09.889 --> 18:11.255
Do you got that?

18:11.257 --> 18:12.623
Okay, I got it.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.358
Good.
I'm sorry.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.027
You don't know how lucky
you are to be married

18:16.029 --> 18:18.696
to that dumb son of a bitch,
so count your blessings,

18:18.698 --> 18:21.132
'cause I'm about to go
get down and dirty

18:21.134 --> 18:23.201
with a CPR dummy.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.437
That's my day.

18:36.381 --> 18:37.381
(slurping)

18:37.383 --> 18:39.450
Hey, Tandy.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.419
You doing okay?

18:41.421 --> 18:43.821
Oh, yeah,
I couldn't be happier.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.289
Do you want to talk about it?

18:52.831 --> 18:55.466
Carol, what if our baby
doesn't like me?

18:55.468 --> 18:56.667
Oh, don't be silly.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.069
No, I mean,
I've been trying

18:58.071 --> 19:00.972
so hard with Jasper,
and he's just not having it.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.840
I'm just worried the same
thing's gonna happen

19:02.842 --> 19:03.908
with our kid.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.010
Tandy, our child's
gonna love you.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.745
And Jasper's
gonna love you, too.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.847
You're a grower, not a shower.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.350
You think so?
Hey, if it makes
you feel better,

19:12.352 --> 19:15.920
someone who said horrible things
about you in the past

19:15.922 --> 19:18.489
just paid you
a real nice compliment.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.590
Gail?
No.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.424
Melissa?
Nope.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.526
Erica?
Guess again.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.827
Todd?
Not today.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.929
Jasper spoke?!
(laughs) What? No.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.197
Carol, that's everyone.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.431
Did you say Gail?

19:27.433 --> 19:28.766
Yes, I did.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.101
Oh, you said that first.

19:30.103 --> 19:31.369
Now I remember.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.437
Gail said something
nice about me?
Mm-hmm.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.373
So you just hold
that chin up

19:35.375 --> 19:38.342
and let the world see
your beautiful neck.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.444
'Cause our baby needs that.

19:40.446 --> 19:41.779
And so does Jasper.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.147
(chuckles)

19:43.149 --> 19:45.016
Yeah.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.759
Knock-knock.

19:56.461 --> 19:57.528
Hey, Tandy.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.963
I just wanted to
come by and say

19:58.965 --> 20:01.299
sorry for being
such a sore loser.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.467
Figured it was time to
extend the old olive branch,

20:03.469 --> 20:04.468
as they say.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.570
So, here you go.

20:05.572 --> 20:06.871
Okay.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.839
I couldn't find an
actual olive branch,

20:08.841 --> 20:10.408
so this is just
a regular tree branch

20:10.410 --> 20:13.411
with an assortment of
canned olives taped to it.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.980
It sure is.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.816
Well, thank you, I guess.

20:18.818 --> 20:19.917
It's really sweet of you.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.485
I know.

20:21.487 --> 20:24.589
Um, anyway, uh,
how's-how's he doing?

20:24.591 --> 20:25.590
Oh, he's good.

20:25.592 --> 20:26.891
We had a lot of fun today.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.326
Really tired him out.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.694
Good.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.429
Well...

20:31.431 --> 20:33.497
Do you want to say good night?

20:33.499 --> 20:35.166
Oh, I mean, I-I don't know.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.335
I mean, you know, he's sleeping.
Tandy, just go say
good night to him.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.737
Yeah, but I don't want to
bug him, he's...
Tandy, just go say good night.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.173
Really?
Yeah.

20:42.175 --> 20:43.241
Okay.

21:01.693 --> 21:02.760
(chuckles)

21:04.296 --> 21:05.963
Uh, okay.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.366
Maybe just for tonight.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.967
Good night, little guy.
