00:01.000 --> 00:02.468
<i>Previously on Kyle XY:</i>

00:02.535 --> 00:05.163
<i>- Did you find something out?
- Looks like it.</i>

00:05.238 --> 00:06.967
Kyle may be connected
to a murder.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.406
<i>Some hikers found it near Victor Falls.</i>

00:10.577 --> 00:13.943
The other night we found
Kyle sitting next to this spot.

00:14.047 --> 00:17.016
You yourself said trauma
may have caused his amnesia.

00:17.083 --> 00:19.415
Yes, it's possible
he witnessed the attack.

00:19.486 --> 00:21.716
Has he started
to remember anything?

00:23.223 --> 00:24.952
You like him more than you let on.

00:25.091 --> 00:27.719
That doesn't mean that I expect
this big commitment.

00:27.794 --> 00:29.819
Just the truth.

00:34.634 --> 00:36.898
I bet your family's
searching for you now.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.029
You didn't just fall from the sky.

00:39.105 --> 00:41.869
This symbol was on
some sort of security key card

00:41.975 --> 00:45.138
- we found near the remains.
- Does this mean anything to you?

00:46.312 --> 00:47.609
No.

02:05.091 --> 02:07.355
<i>It was my first dream.</i>

02:07.427 --> 02:09.554
<i>At least the first I could remember.</i>

02:10.797 --> 02:14.460
<i>My subconscious mind was weaving
a tale of love and loss,</i>

02:15.068 --> 02:17.935
<i>even though my memories contain
no such stories.</i>

02:18.705 --> 02:20.434
<i>I wondered what it meant.</i>

02:20.507 --> 02:23.135
<i>Was it something
I had already experienced</i>

02:23.710 --> 02:26.144
<i>or simply a vision of things to come?</i>

02:27.013 --> 02:29.573
<i>I wished to go back
to that moment with Amanda.</i>

02:30.550 --> 02:32.609
<i>I wanted to see how it would end.</i>

02:40.627 --> 02:42.993
He didn't draw this
after he saw the keycard?

02:43.096 --> 02:46.725
I noticed these markings
on his drawings well before.

02:46.799 --> 02:49.359
Kyle, why did you draw this in pieces?

02:49.469 --> 02:51.096
That's how I saw it.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.197
It's possible that fractured pieces
of his past

02:54.274 --> 02:56.538
are starting to enter his consciousness.

02:56.609 --> 03:00.067
I've seen it before in patients
with trauma-based amnesia.

03:00.146 --> 03:03.411
<i>Everyone was concerned about
the images coming from my head.</i>

03:03.483 --> 03:07.351
<i>I couldn't explain them any more than
I could explain my dream about Amanda.</i>

03:07.420 --> 03:11.049
<i>My mind was doing things
the rest of me didn't understand.</i>

03:14.194 --> 03:15.627
Where you going, Lori?

03:16.262 --> 03:18.628
Uh, yeah, where you going, Lori?

03:19.265 --> 03:22.132
- The pool?
- Last time I checked,

03:22.202 --> 03:24.727
looking after Kyle
meant looking after Kyle.

03:24.804 --> 03:28.296
- But he's busy.
- Actually, we're done here for now.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.705
Kyle, do you want to go to the pool?

03:30.777 --> 03:35.237
I'm the only girl in America who has
to baby-sit a fully-grown teenager.

03:35.315 --> 03:39.411
Take your brother too 'cause we have to
go to the high school to register Kyle.

03:39.485 --> 03:43.546
Uh... Choice.
What if I don't want to go to the pool?

03:43.623 --> 03:46.091
Uh, maybe you don't want
to spend the rest of the day

03:46.159 --> 03:48.252
with your summer reading list either.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.689
I'll go get my stuff.

03:52.699 --> 03:53.859
Fabulous.

04:12.185 --> 04:15.018
Ten years of service
to the company, Tom.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.749
Sorry to see you go.

04:19.225 --> 04:20.988
Time to move on.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.964
- Is this your forwarding address?
- Yeah.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.797
Good. The company
likes to keep in touch.

04:29.902 --> 04:32.393
Especially now with Kern still MIA.

04:33.072 --> 04:36.303
- I'm sure you'll track him down.
- Goes without saying.

04:47.153 --> 04:49.121
A friendly reminder,

04:49.188 --> 04:53.124
you know how aggressively we enforce
these confidentiality agreements.

04:53.192 --> 04:54.819
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

04:56.562 --> 04:57.995
One more thing.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.327
Your security card.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.865
Of course.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.666
<i>Love and Memories]</i>

05:37.070 --> 05:38.901
Whoa!

05:39.572 --> 05:42.200
Both of you stay
at least 20 feet from me at all times.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.368
Close enough I can see
you're in trouble,

05:44.444 --> 05:46.071
far enough away I can ignore it.

05:46.145 --> 05:47.612
Lori, come on!

05:47.680 --> 05:49.113
Over here.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.108
And don't drown.

05:53.453 --> 05:54.715
I'll tell you, brother,

05:54.787 --> 05:57.620
give a woman an ounce of power
and she'll run over you.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.858
Why is Amanda sitting up there?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.989
She's a lifeguard.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.255
She guards life?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.731
Sorta.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.030
She'll jump in to save you
if you can't swim.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.580
He's like, seriously, manorexic.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.548
Eat a sandwich!

06:28.855 --> 06:31.619
- Yo, Trager.
- What's up?

06:41.234 --> 06:45.136
Are you still mad at him for lying or
are we playing the hard-to-get game?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.207
Not a game. I'm over it.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.138
- Really?
- Really.

06:52.445 --> 06:55.312
So you're not secretly yearning
he'll call you over?

06:55.381 --> 06:56.541
Nope.

06:56.616 --> 06:59.176
You're not quietly wishing
he'd sit here with you?

06:59.285 --> 07:00.843
Not in the least.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.517
Deep in your subconscious,

07:03.589 --> 07:07.047
you have no desire to sleep with him
at Preston's party Friday,

07:07.126 --> 07:09.390
even though we both swore we wouldn't

07:09.462 --> 07:12.022
go back to school
with our virginities intact?

07:12.098 --> 07:15.261
My virginity. Yours hasn't been
an issue for quite some time.

07:15.334 --> 07:16.562
Whatever.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.801
Are you serious?

07:18.871 --> 07:20.202
You're really over him?

07:20.273 --> 07:24.369
I'm done with the whole friends
with benefits. It's not fun anymore.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.811
We're not really friends,
which means we're just benefits.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.372
If I'm gonna be giving benefits
to anyone, it should mean something.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.614
Look who's all protective
of her first time.

07:34.720 --> 07:38.053
You've wanted to sleep with Declan
for, like, ever.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.149
I still do, but...

07:40.226 --> 07:42.786
...I'm not giving it up
to some guy whose idea of fun

07:42.895 --> 07:46.160
is crawling into my bedroom drunk
at 3:00 in the morning.

07:46.232 --> 07:49.929
We'll just have to find you
another de-virginizing opportunity.

07:50.002 --> 07:52.493
Like yummity goodness over there.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.096
Eww!

07:54.173 --> 07:57.040
- Hilary!
- Fine. I'll take him.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.875
You are so not allowed to corrupt Kyle.

07:59.946 --> 08:03.780
- Why not?
- Because it's, like, wrong.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.051
- When do we swim?
- We don't come here to swim.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.019
We come here to scope babes.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.292
Babes?

08:14.360 --> 08:16.123
You know, the ladies.

08:16.195 --> 08:17.321
Hot mommas.

08:17.396 --> 08:19.364
Girls with C-cups.

08:22.535 --> 08:24.162
Like her.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.371
Good Lord of the Rings.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.271
Is she a friend of yours?

08:29.342 --> 08:32.208
Dude, a chick like that
doesn't know I exist.

08:32.278 --> 08:35.975
- So you won't go talk to her?
- Talk to her? Are you nuts?

08:37.549 --> 08:40.178
So we come to the pool but don't swim,

08:40.253 --> 08:43.813
and we scope babes,
but we don't talk to them?

08:43.890 --> 08:47.018
It's a cruel world. I just live in it.

08:53.232 --> 08:54.790
Did she just?

08:55.501 --> 08:56.934
Don't move.

09:08.514 --> 09:11.347
- Lori, my favorite sister of all time.
- No.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.180
- Come on. Go in the bathroom.
- No.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.652
Seriously.
Go in the girls' locker room.

09:15.721 --> 09:19.282
Get the name and the number of the girl
in the pink bikini with the...

09:19.358 --> 09:21.223
...polka dots on her whatnots.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.057
Her whatnots?

09:23.129 --> 09:24.596
Forget it.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.761
Look, you're gonna go
in there right now,

09:29.835 --> 09:33.134
or I'll yell, "Lori Trager
stuffs her bra," at the top of my lungs.

09:33.205 --> 09:34.331
You are the devil.

09:35.841 --> 09:38.537
Fine, you manipulative little freak.

09:44.550 --> 09:47.280
He has no records,
no history of school?

09:47.353 --> 09:50.413
As I explained,
Kyle's situation is unique.

09:50.489 --> 09:52.218
It certainly is.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.893
But he's exceptionally bright.

09:54.994 --> 09:58.157
You're requesting
a one-on-one tutor. That's, um...

09:58.230 --> 10:00.255
That's an expensive arrangement.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.893
Legally, you're obligated to provide it.

10:06.305 --> 10:07.932
I know you, Mrs. Trager.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.237
Anything I say in opposition to this

10:11.310 --> 10:14.746
will be met with all legal precedents
that will refute my position.

10:14.814 --> 10:18.773
Now that you mention it, Mr. Hooper,
I have done the research.

10:21.220 --> 10:25.589
Are you sure he wouldn't be better
suited for a special ed program?

10:25.691 --> 10:27.955
- He's not disabled.
- I'm sure.

10:28.027 --> 10:31.155
To be fair, high school can be
a very difficult experience

10:31.230 --> 10:33.596
even for the most
well-adjusted students.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.065
If this boy is special,

10:36.135 --> 10:39.002
it may not be
the easiest of transitions for him.

10:39.071 --> 10:42.404
I assume you'll pass our request
up the administrative ladder.

10:43.342 --> 10:44.604
Of course.

10:45.277 --> 10:46.835
Good.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.950
- Did you find her?
- There is one girl in there.

10:54.020 --> 10:58.286
Gorgeous, great body.
She's in the shower right now, naked.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.917
- That's her.
- That's impossible.

11:01.027 --> 11:02.517
Josh, she's a ten.

11:02.595 --> 11:05.723
There is no way a girl that hot
would come within a mile of you.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.767
- Get in there and find out her name.
- It's not her.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.803
- Quit messing around, Lori.
- Quit bugging me, Josh.

11:11.904 --> 11:14.270
Lori Trager stuffs her bra.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.036
Josh Trager has wet dreams.

11:17.109 --> 11:20.875
- You are so dead.
- You guys? Where's Kyle?

11:26.218 --> 11:28.243
<i>It felt just like my dream.</i>

11:30.056 --> 11:33.617
<i>And just like Josh said,
she came to help me.</i>

11:40.499 --> 11:42.831
- Is he OK?
- How long was he under?

11:43.869 --> 11:46.030
<i>My whole body tensed and tingled.</i>

11:46.105 --> 11:48.938
<i>I suddenly felt
a strange sort of pressure.</i>

11:52.378 --> 11:54.278
<i>Good pressure.</i>

11:54.346 --> 11:56.371
No way.

11:57.116 --> 11:58.481
Oh.

11:59.418 --> 12:01.443
Kyle, cover up.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.216
Oh, my God! Look at his shorts.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.096
He had a lot of nerve
implying Kyle didn't belong there.

12:13.165 --> 12:16.794
He's not an educator. He's a bureaucrat
worried about the bottom line.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.599
- He was inappropriate.
- He's not subtle for sure.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.902
But he has a point.

12:21.974 --> 12:24.670
- Hey, honey.
- Houston, we have a problem.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.712
What's up?

12:26.779 --> 12:28.076
Funny you should ask.

12:46.198 --> 12:47.358
Rough day?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.694
You want to talk about what happened?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.333
At the pool?

12:53.405 --> 12:54.736
You mean...

12:56.776 --> 12:59.336
- Yeah.
- Everybody laughed at me.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.003
You don't know why?

13:02.114 --> 13:04.639
- No.
- You never had an erection before?

13:04.717 --> 13:06.617
Not that I can remember.

13:09.488 --> 13:10.785
OK, then.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.626
First of all,
you have to understand that

13:17.696 --> 13:20.961
what happened to you
was completely normal.

13:21.767 --> 13:24.736
You just don't typically
want it to happen in public.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.830
- Then it's not normal.
- No, it is.

13:29.074 --> 13:33.602
It's your body's way of...
telling you how you feel.

13:33.679 --> 13:37.979
In fact, it's
a very honest physical response.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.416
Then why should it be hidden?

13:40.519 --> 13:42.180
Well...

13:43.622 --> 13:44.953
Uh...

13:47.660 --> 13:49.025
Poor dad. He has to explain

13:49.128 --> 13:51.961
the birds and the bees to someone
with quadruple his IQ.

13:52.031 --> 13:55.865
He thought he was done with this part
of his job. I know I did.

13:55.935 --> 13:58.028
- You were good at it.
- You think?

13:58.704 --> 14:01.537
I feel well-informed.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.632
I'm always available for brush-ups.

14:03.709 --> 14:06.075
Trust me,
there's nothing to brush up for.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.341
Hi.

14:10.449 --> 14:13.077
- Hello.
- Is Lori around?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.120
Declan. Hi.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.521
Thanks, Mom.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.116
You're welcome.

14:22.661 --> 14:24.219
Come in.

14:29.768 --> 14:33.704
So you're, um, at my house.

14:33.772 --> 14:35.103
Yeah.

14:35.774 --> 14:38.504
In daylight.
Through the front door.

14:38.577 --> 14:40.272
Who would have thunk?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.610
- Why?
- I didn't see you leave the pool.

14:44.416 --> 14:45.883
Yeah. I had to bail.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.954
Anyway, um, Hilary said you'd be home.

14:51.924 --> 14:54.654
We still haven't covered
the "why" part yet.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.287
I thought you might want
to go to Preston's party.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.057
Of course. Everyone's going.

14:59.131 --> 15:02.396
I meant, um... with me.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.003
Oh.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.602
All this back and forth, Trager,
I'm tired of it.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.234
And I'm sorry for whatever I did
to piss you off.

15:11.310 --> 15:13.369
I think it's time
we went out together.

15:13.445 --> 15:16.380
Really went out.
But if you're not into it...

15:16.448 --> 15:18.348
No. I'm into it.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.782
Well, good.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.751
- So we'll go.
- Yeah.

15:24.490 --> 15:25.650
Cool.

15:27.793 --> 15:31.285
Oh, uh... Do you want me to, like,
pick you up or something?

15:31.964 --> 15:35.400
- I can meet you there.
- Sounds like a plan.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.527
All right. Later, Trager.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.162
Later.

15:47.313 --> 15:48.678
OK, look.

15:48.747 --> 15:50.772
I've been on
the other side of that talk.

15:50.849 --> 15:52.009
It ain't pretty.

15:52.117 --> 15:55.883
When it happens in front of people I
should think of something I don't like.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.353
Totally.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.482
I usually go with zits and old people.

16:00.559 --> 16:02.424
- You?
- Grapefruit.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.263
Hmm.

16:06.365 --> 16:10.529
You should know, there are other ways
to handle your little problem.

16:12.438 --> 16:13.700
Ta-da.

16:13.772 --> 16:16.468
- Charlotte?
- No. Charlotte's mine, dude.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.510
You are not ready for Charlotte.

16:20.212 --> 16:22.271
Meet Ginger.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.857
- What do I do with it?
- Look at it.

16:37.029 --> 16:40.192
Like at the pool, scope babes.

16:40.265 --> 16:43.928
Except when you're here alone
you can lock your door

16:44.003 --> 16:46.563
and do other things.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.744
Is Kyle around? I feel horrible
about what happened today.

16:57.816 --> 17:00.284
Straight back,
other side of the kitchen.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.252
Thanks.

17:49.802 --> 17:50.894
Hi.

17:55.474 --> 17:57.237
I have to go.

18:05.684 --> 18:09.586
How'd you like to get out of watching
Kyle for a couple hours every day?

18:09.655 --> 18:12.021
- I'm listening.
- I can make it happen,

18:12.124 --> 18:14.456
in exchange for
Miss Pink Bikini's digits.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.928
- Are we still on that?
- Are you interested or not?

18:17.996 --> 18:19.293
Of course.

18:20.399 --> 18:21.957
Hi, Mom.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.129
What do you want?

18:24.203 --> 18:28.139
Lori and I were thinking, maybe we
shouldn't bring Kyle to the pool today.

18:28.207 --> 18:31.768
- I mean, not after yesterday.
- Because of the incident?

18:31.877 --> 18:34.641
No. I was more worried
about the whole drowning thing.

18:34.746 --> 18:37.715
- What drowning thing?
- Kyle doesn't know how to swim.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.752
That's no reason he should miss out
on going to the pool.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.583
- We should get him lessons.
- That's a great idea.

18:43.655 --> 18:45.782
They offer lessons down there.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.952
A couple hours every day,
he'll be swimming in no time.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.468
Amanda, your next lesson's here.

18:59.538 --> 19:00.664
Thanks.

19:08.347 --> 19:09.712
She hates me.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.375
Just don't hump her leg
and you'll be fine.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.984
Hi. You're Ashleigh, right?

19:20.058 --> 19:22.891
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi. Can I talk to you for a second?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.389
Mission accomplished.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.434
Ditched responsibility
and paid off a debt, all at once.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.471
You know, I'd happily
give Kyle swimming lessons.

19:34.239 --> 19:37.731
- I'd show him the breaststroke.
- You're seriously grossing me out.

19:37.809 --> 19:41.267
- OK, prude-y.
- Please. I am so not a prude.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.109
Yeah. Just a virgin.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.150
By a very minor technicality.

19:45.851 --> 19:49.412
Besides, I decided you're right
about the sex thing.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.783
You're kidding.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.586
Well, it's not like
I'm waiting for true love.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.684
The only reason I've held out this long

19:55.761 --> 19:58.730
is he hadn't done anything
to deserve it.

19:58.797 --> 20:02.699
But if he's finally stepping up,
there's no reason why I shouldn't.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.402
So... cup your hand

20:07.306 --> 20:09.171
and pull water along with you.

20:15.647 --> 20:16.944
You have to float.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.618
- Float.
- Yeah. You know.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.356
You don't know. Uh...

20:26.325 --> 20:27.485
Here.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.063
See? Let the water hold you up.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.398
Grapefruit.

20:57.089 --> 21:01.219
Her name is Ashleigh Redmond,
she's your age, Catholic school.

21:01.860 --> 21:05.023
You better call now
and get the humiliation over with.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.724
Sweet. Thanks.

21:07.466 --> 21:08.933
Whatever.

21:29.321 --> 21:30.447
<i>Hello?</i>

21:33.225 --> 21:34.590
Damn.

21:37.329 --> 21:38.489
<i>Buoyancy.</i>

21:39.131 --> 21:40.257
<i>Strokes.</i>

21:40.732 --> 21:41.960
<i>Breathing.</i>

21:43.402 --> 21:45.165
<i>It all made sense in theory.</i>

21:45.871 --> 21:48.203
<i>Now it was time to put it into practice.</i>

21:53.679 --> 21:55.237
Where did he go?

21:59.217 --> 22:01.048
You must be a great teacher.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.520
Hey.

22:21.373 --> 22:23.898
Are you sure you've never
been swimming before?

22:23.975 --> 22:25.272
Yesterday.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.642
That wasn't swimming.
That was drowning.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.147
You don't...
You don't have a belly button.

22:33.218 --> 22:34.685
No.

22:34.753 --> 22:37.313
- Why not?
- I don't know.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.992
You still don't remember anything
about your life before?

22:41.093 --> 22:42.958
No.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.589
But you can jump off tall buildings
and swim like an Olympic champion.

22:46.698 --> 22:49.064
- Josh thinks I'm an alien.
- Or Superman.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.902
- You're not angry anymore.
- I never was.

22:54.005 --> 22:57.634
I just... thought your drawings
were kind of weird.

23:00.278 --> 23:01.540
Why?

23:03.014 --> 23:04.709
There were a lot of me.

23:06.485 --> 23:09.579
I draw everything
exactly how I see it in my head.

23:10.389 --> 23:13.517
You're special.
I can't seem to get you right.

23:14.292 --> 23:17.784
- How come?
- Seems like there's something missing.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.828
My mom's gonna be out
tomorrow afternoon.

23:24.903 --> 23:27.633
Come by my house.
I want to show you something.

23:30.575 --> 23:33.476
Hey. I spoke to Detective Breen again.

23:33.712 --> 23:36.272
- Did he have anything about the logo?
- Nothing.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.782
It doesn't match
any corporation on record.

23:38.850 --> 23:42.752
They haven't been able to decrypt
the computerized strip on the keycard.

23:42.821 --> 23:46.279
Must be some sophisticated
security system, whatever it's for.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.882
This worries me, Stephen.

23:47.959 --> 23:50.519
We have no idea
what Kyle might have witnessed.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.758
You're doing what you can
to help him remember.

23:54.766 --> 23:57.735
Well, maybe now's not the best time
to send him to school.

23:58.470 --> 24:02.201
Oh, please tell me you're not letting
that vice principal get to you.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.639
Well, he's right.

24:03.708 --> 24:07.974
I want to protect Kyle, not thrust him
into another traumatizing experience.

24:08.046 --> 24:10.879
Don't you think he should live
like a normal teenager?

24:10.949 --> 24:14.248
I'd feel better if I believed
he was normal.

24:32.070 --> 24:33.435
Tom.

24:34.539 --> 24:37.997
- What are you doing here?
- Something's been bothering me.

24:38.076 --> 24:40.044
I thought we should have a little chat.

24:41.847 --> 24:46.147
Your keycard. I ran it through
the system to deactivate it.

24:46.685 --> 24:49.552
The clearance code didn't match
your assignment.

24:51.389 --> 24:54.290
- Strange.
- That's what I said.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.052
I thought maybe it
was a computer error.

24:57.128 --> 25:01.588
And then I discovered that Kern
was cleared to that level.

25:02.934 --> 25:06.097
Interesting coincidence,
him being missing and all.

25:08.306 --> 25:10.672
I thought it might be
a piece of information

25:10.775 --> 25:14.142
you might find worth something.

25:15.146 --> 25:17.706
Something you might
want me to keep quiet.

25:20.285 --> 25:21.912
Get out.

25:32.097 --> 25:33.325
Think about it.

25:37.002 --> 25:39.527
I have a feeling you don't want
the company to know

25:39.604 --> 25:41.367
what you've been up to.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.206
This was my dad's.

26:16.942 --> 26:18.569
He was an artist too.

26:19.444 --> 26:21.469
Not for, like, a living, but...

26:22.113 --> 26:23.341
...it was his thing.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.882
Was?

26:28.853 --> 26:30.150
He died last year.

26:31.189 --> 26:33.453
He's what's missing.

26:37.963 --> 26:40.932
Anyways, take a look.

26:58.149 --> 27:02.085
- He saw this in his head?
- Kind of.

27:04.022 --> 27:07.583
Art is about drawing what you feel,
not just what you see.

27:07.692 --> 27:09.250
How do you draw a feeling?

27:09.361 --> 27:10.828
It's like piano.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.567
Right now I'm just playing notes.

27:23.675 --> 27:27.133
But art is about putting
your whole self into something.

27:27.212 --> 27:29.510
Everything you feel.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.127
How do you feel?

27:44.929 --> 27:47.022
Just listen.

28:18.963 --> 28:22.524
<i>I didn't know that I could make
a picture of how I felt inside.</i>

28:22.600 --> 28:24.261
<i>But I really wanted to try.</i>

29:11.816 --> 29:13.147
Hello.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.850
- Josh Trager?
- Uh...

29:17.956 --> 29:20.015
- Hi?
- I saw the caller ID.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.753
- Your sister said I'd hear from you.
- She did?

29:22.827 --> 29:25.193
- I'm totally psyched.
- You are?

29:25.296 --> 29:27.230
You going to Jeff Preston's party?

29:27.298 --> 29:30.028
I don't know him,
but everyone goes, right?

29:30.101 --> 29:32.831
- Right.
- Awesome. So see you there.

29:50.889 --> 29:53.323
- Wardrobe crisis?
- The usual.

29:53.391 --> 29:56.690
- I love that red shirt you have.
- I think I'll go with the blue.

29:59.063 --> 30:01.088
Josh wants to go to the party.

30:01.166 --> 30:04.033
- I know you have a date.
- Date?

30:04.102 --> 30:07.265
- Mom, so '80s.
- OK. Whatever you want to call it.

30:07.372 --> 30:10.136
I was gonna say no,
then he went into this sales pitch

30:10.208 --> 30:12.733
about how it's a rite of passage
into high school.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.438
He's sort of right.

30:14.512 --> 30:16.673
But don't worry.
It's chaperoned.

30:18.183 --> 30:22.483
And I'll look out for him. Unless he
embarrasses me, then I'll kill him.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.419
Thank you, Lori.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.522
So this Declan,

30:27.592 --> 30:30.254
is he a good guy?

30:30.328 --> 30:33.422
Mmm... Most of the time.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.257
Kyle.

31:03.328 --> 31:05.023
You're coming to the party.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.358
I don't like parties.

31:07.432 --> 31:09.559
You have to come. Everyone goes.

31:10.268 --> 31:13.237
- And Amanda?
- Guaranteed.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.666
Good. I have something for her.

31:16.741 --> 31:18.641
Great. Bring it. Get dressed.

31:30.922 --> 31:32.583
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, guys.

31:33.925 --> 31:36.689
- Bye, guys.
- Kyle, you're not going.

31:36.794 --> 31:40.628
Lori, see you at midnight. Kyle, Josh,
10:00 or you won't live to see 10:01.

31:41.833 --> 31:44.301
- But...
- Go ahead, have a good time.

32:06.858 --> 32:10.021
- Let's get this over with.
- I thought you'd come around.

32:10.828 --> 32:12.955
I underestimated you, Tom.

32:13.031 --> 32:16.000
I never thought the quiet guy
from work would be...

32:37.055 --> 32:38.317
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:53.504 --> 32:56.234
Remember the rules.
No drinking, no puking,

32:56.307 --> 32:58.673
out of here by 9:45.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.148
I'll be watching and I will narc.

33:04.916 --> 33:07.817
- I don't see Ashleigh.
- Or Amanda.

33:07.885 --> 33:10.251
I should have known
it was too good to be true.

33:12.256 --> 33:14.224
There she is.

33:17.562 --> 33:20.122
- Hi, Josh.
- Ashleigh.

33:21.132 --> 33:23.191
- Hey.
- I'm so glad you made it.

33:23.267 --> 33:25.565
I don't know anyone here.
Come on.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.119
- I like the shirt.
- Thanks.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.421
- I was going for naughty and nice.
- It's working.

33:52.263 --> 33:54.288
- Yo, Preston.
- What's up, guys?

33:54.999 --> 33:56.330
- Great party.
- Yeah.

33:56.401 --> 33:58.767
It'd be better if my parents
weren't lurking.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.634
But I hid beer around
the property so help yourselves.

34:01.739 --> 34:04.503
Thanks, man. Thirsty?

34:04.575 --> 34:05.940
Always.

34:14.786 --> 34:15.946
Oh, sweet.

34:18.121 --> 34:20.989
- I didn't bring a suit.
- Damn.

34:21.592 --> 34:22.956
Me neither.

34:26.597 --> 34:28.030
What are you doing?

34:28.099 --> 34:30.226
I don't want to get my clothes wet.

34:33.170 --> 34:35.833
- What are you doing?
- Checking for hidden cameras.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.170
You're funny.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.577
It's my thing.

34:56.293 --> 34:57.989
Right. Sorry.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.597
Why are you sorry?

35:24.655 --> 35:27.624
You're hot.

35:27.725 --> 35:29.283
It's warm outside.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.828
No, I mean "hot" hot.

35:32.396 --> 35:34.023
Like smokin'.

35:39.504 --> 35:42.473
Sister Mary Lourdes
would definitely not approve.

35:43.441 --> 35:45.534
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

35:45.610 --> 35:47.441
This is totally fun.

35:47.512 --> 35:50.970
When I saw you at the pool the other day
I was hoping you'd talk to me.

35:51.048 --> 35:53.414
- You were?
- I thought you were cute.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.042
Huh. You did?

35:55.153 --> 35:58.316
There aren't any other boys
in my school to compare you to.

35:58.389 --> 36:00.050
But yeah.

36:06.531 --> 36:08.294
What the hell is going on?

36:09.200 --> 36:12.169
- Mr. And Mrs. Preston?
- Get out of there right now.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.703
Honey, come on.

36:18.976 --> 36:21.945
- Young man.
- I can't.

36:22.813 --> 36:24.678
Zits. Old people.

36:24.749 --> 36:27.445
- Zits. Old people.
- I'm gonna count to three.

36:27.952 --> 36:31.888
- One, two...
- Grapefruit.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.901
So...

36:50.908 --> 36:52.034
Yeah.

36:52.109 --> 36:55.408
Um, was that your, uh?

36:57.048 --> 36:58.515
Yeah.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.312
- Yours?
- No.

37:00.384 --> 37:03.649
I mean, I haven't done it a ton
but it wasn't my first.

37:10.027 --> 37:11.289
It gets better.

37:15.166 --> 37:18.101
Well, I better get back
to the party.

37:26.777 --> 37:31.111
Everyone thinks I'm a slut because of
the eighth grade field trip to Tacoma.

37:31.182 --> 37:33.514
But I just want a sweet guy
to cuddle with.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.814
Is that so wrong?

37:36.554 --> 37:38.715
You feel nice.

37:38.789 --> 37:41.019
<i>Hilary made my body feel good.</i>

37:41.092 --> 37:43.253
<i>But like the girls
in Josh's magazines,</i>

37:43.327 --> 37:45.488
<i>something didn't feel right.</i>

37:45.596 --> 37:48.087
<i>There was a piece missing.</i>

37:49.300 --> 37:50.665
Hilary, get off of him.

37:50.768 --> 37:54.431
- Go away. Ow!
- God, you slut.

37:54.505 --> 37:57.633
- I told you to leave him alone.
- What are you worried I'll do?

37:57.708 --> 37:59.767
Gee, I wonder.

37:59.844 --> 38:02.210
Do you really think
I'm such a super-skeeze?

38:02.313 --> 38:06.079
You've held out on one thing and you
act like the frickin' purity police.

38:06.183 --> 38:08.151
- That's not what...
- I'm tired of it.

38:08.219 --> 38:11.677
Poor Declan. I never should have
told him to ask you out.

38:14.058 --> 38:15.286
What?

38:16.193 --> 38:19.094
I told him you weren't gonna put out
unless he stepped up.

38:19.163 --> 38:21.723
She didn't say it like that.
That's not what...

38:21.799 --> 38:23.164
Don't talk to me.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.161
You two totally did it, didn't you?

38:30.775 --> 38:34.939
Who knew after all this time
you'd be so easy?

38:44.622 --> 38:48.149
Declan, man, dude. You gotta
come check this out. It's hilarious.

39:11.782 --> 39:14.342
We still in the non-speaking part
of the evening?

39:16.087 --> 39:18.146
How could you let him go to the party?

39:18.222 --> 39:19.849
We let Josh go and he's younger.

39:19.924 --> 39:22.484
I'm not worried about Josh
handling himself.

39:22.593 --> 39:24.458
I'm not worried about Kyle.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.496
Listen, Nicole,

39:27.031 --> 39:29.727
you need to ease up
on the reins just a little bit.

39:30.601 --> 39:33.365
Kyle needs to get out there
and experience life.

39:33.437 --> 39:35.905
He needs to have it
knock him around a little bit.

39:35.973 --> 39:39.909
- We took him so we could protect him.
- Not by keeping him in a bubble.

39:41.712 --> 39:42.974
All right, look.

39:43.914 --> 39:46.382
- I realize that he's your patient.
- Yes.

39:47.785 --> 39:50.811
But it's hard for me
to stay clinical about him.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.515
Of course it is.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.922
Let's handle him
like we handle Josh and Lori.

39:55.760 --> 39:59.924
The reason they're well-adjusted is
because we treat them with respect.

40:00.598 --> 40:04.432
We let them make their mistakes and
they know we're here when they need us.

40:04.502 --> 40:07.266
You need to give Kyle the same chance.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.201
I hope you're right.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.973
It had to happen sometime.

40:20.751 --> 40:23.777
<i>Everyone had arrived
at the party with expectations.</i>

40:24.355 --> 40:26.619
<i>None had been met the way we'd hoped.</i>

40:31.796 --> 40:34.162
- What are you doing?
- Hiding.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.268
From what?

40:41.906 --> 40:43.066
Everything.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.473
Everybody out.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.267
So you finally tapped that, huh?

41:12.336 --> 41:14.395
No, man.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.099
She's not like that.

41:30.721 --> 41:33.087
<i>Seeing Amanda
I realized something.</i>

41:34.325 --> 41:38.785
<i>I had been struggling to understand what
my mind and body were trying to tell me.</i>

41:38.863 --> 41:41.354
<i>And right then I knew what it was.</i>

41:42.233 --> 41:46.067
<i>Everything was working together,
sending a message to my heart.</i>

41:47.705 --> 41:49.229
- Kyle.
- Amanda.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.769
- There you are.
- Hey.

41:54.612 --> 41:56.477
I've been waiting for you.

41:56.547 --> 41:58.606
Charlie, this is my neighbor, Kyle.

41:58.682 --> 42:00.650
Kyle, this is Charlie, my boyfriend.

42:00.718 --> 42:02.276
Hey, nice to meet you, man.

42:02.353 --> 42:05.322
<i>Now my heart was sending
a message to the rest of my body.</i>

42:05.422 --> 42:06.787
You live across the street?

42:06.891 --> 42:08.188
<i>Pain.</i>

42:08.259 --> 42:10.124
Next door.
He just moved in.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.279
<i>Life is a puzzle.</i>

42:34.351 --> 42:37.218
<i>Every piece fits together
to create who we are,</i>

42:37.288 --> 42:38.619
<i>what we do,</i>

42:38.689 --> 42:40.122
<i>how we feel.</i>

42:41.325 --> 42:44.658
<i>Every experience shapes us
into who we will eventually become.</i>

42:49.800 --> 42:51.859
<i>I began as a blank slate.</i>

42:52.703 --> 42:55.263
<i>Maybe my hidden memories tell
a different story.</i>

42:55.339 --> 42:59.503
<i>Maybe I hold the key to a mystery
even greater than that of my past.</i>

43:11.055 --> 43:13.285
<i>I'd been so eager to remember,</i>

43:13.357 --> 43:16.326
<i>to grow up and experience life
like Lori and Josh.</i>

43:17.861 --> 43:21.820
<i>But in that one moment I wished
I could go back to that blank slate.</i>

43:23.901 --> 43:27.234
<i>When life was easier.</i>

43:30.374 --> 43:32.501
<i>I think they wished for it too.</i>

43:32.576 --> 43:33.907
Ready?

43:34.912 --> 43:36.436
Let's go home.

43:36.513 --> 43:37.878
OK.
