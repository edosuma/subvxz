WEBVTT

02:01.000 --> 02:04.180
Hey Roy, I'm going to borrow
Brian for a few minutes.

02:08.919 --> 02:13.190
10-4,.

02:13.190 --> 02:14.370
Yeah, that's OK.

02:14.370 --> 02:16.840
If you would come over here
and watch this and make sure

02:16.840 --> 02:20.250
this stays quiet over
here and no vehicles.

02:20.250 --> 02:21.310
Are they doing something?

02:21.310 --> 02:23.150
Yeah, they're just
driving back and forth,

02:23.150 --> 02:25.460
and we need to stop
the traffic over here.

02:25.460 --> 02:28.110
What are you guys going to do?

02:28.110 --> 02:30.490
They're taking a picture.

02:30.490 --> 02:32.850
So just over there, just
make sure it stays quiet

02:32.850 --> 02:33.998
if you would please.

02:35.790 --> 02:36.860
OK, thanks Brian.

02:57.570 --> 02:59.780
Hi, I'm Richard Hodges.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.490
I'm in charge of
maintenance here

03:01.490 --> 03:04.670
at Bisbee Unified School
District, second-oldest school

03:04.670 --> 03:06.470
district in the state.

03:06.470 --> 03:07.850
I'm here at the high school.

03:07.850 --> 03:12.410
This high school was built in
1957 by the Phelps Dodge Copper

03:12.410 --> 03:13.930
Queen Branch.

03:13.930 --> 03:15.860
It was built when
copper controlled

03:15.860 --> 03:17.398
and ruled everything.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.890
It was built for 900 students.

03:23.890 --> 03:29.140
In 1969 when I started school
here, 900 students were here.

03:29.140 --> 03:32.380
Unfortunately, we're
down to around 300 now.

03:42.210 --> 03:45.750
I had family on both
sides of the deportation,

03:45.750 --> 03:49.080
both from the mining
company's standpoint

03:49.080 --> 03:50.970
and from the miners' standpoint.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.160
I had a cousin that was a miner.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.820
He lived up in old Bisbee.

03:58.820 --> 04:02.930
And he was rounded up with
the rest of the miners.

04:02.930 --> 04:05.540
They figured that it was one
of these deals where the mining

04:05.540 --> 04:07.820
company was just trying
to flex their muscles

04:07.820 --> 04:09.512
and intimidate them.

04:09.512 --> 04:10.970
When they brought
in the rail cars,

04:10.970 --> 04:14.060
they realized how
serious it was.

04:14.060 --> 04:16.459
When they were
disconnecting the train,

04:16.459 --> 04:19.970
the deputized foreman
were telling the miners

04:19.970 --> 04:24.650
if we ever see you in Bisbee
again, we will kill you.

04:24.650 --> 04:27.200
Cousin said he reached
through the rail car

04:27.200 --> 04:31.940
and grabbed one of the deputies
that he knows and held him,

04:31.940 --> 04:35.600
told him no, Bisbee is my town.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.410
I am going to come
back to Bisbee.

04:37.410 --> 04:41.090
I am going to kill your
family in front of you,

04:41.090 --> 04:43.590
and then I'm going to kill you.

04:43.590 --> 04:44.720
And I believe he meant it.

04:53.916 --> 04:55.665
Testing.

04:55.665 --> 04:59.450
OK, we will be loading
you on rail cars.

04:59.450 --> 05:01.280
Enjoy the AC while
you've got it.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.775
Thank you for riding
the Deportation Express.

06:08.270 --> 06:12.020
This is a town with
so much history.

06:12.020 --> 06:15.530
So I created this audio
book by interviewing

06:15.530 --> 06:17.180
89 different people
in the community

06:17.180 --> 06:18.530
and getting their stories.

06:18.530 --> 06:20.870
Bisbee
in the beginning--

06:20.870 --> 06:24.530
the town of Bisbee was
officially founded in 1880

06:24.530 --> 06:27.350
during those years
of war between the US

06:27.350 --> 06:28.910
Army and the Chiricahua Apache.

06:28.910 --> 06:35.840
From 1877 to 1975, nearly
8 billion pounds of copper

06:35.840 --> 06:39.890
were dug out of an area
two miles by three miles.

06:39.890 --> 06:44.240
And within this area are two
enormous pits and some 2,000

06:44.240 --> 06:46.670
miles of underground tunnels.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.740
More than 30 different
nationalities

06:48.740 --> 06:52.400
were represented in Bisbee,
and a hierarchy took root.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.570
Peter Young.

06:53.570 --> 06:55.850
There was definitely a
distinction going on here

06:55.850 --> 06:58.760
amongst the races,
and the Anglos

06:58.760 --> 07:01.370
were definitely in control.

07:01.370 --> 07:03.020
This was a white man's camp.

07:03.020 --> 07:06.510
The best jobs went
to married white men.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.690
It was so productive
that people could hardly

07:08.690 --> 07:10.170
believe it would end.

07:10.170 --> 07:14.030
But after nearly 100 years of
production, the mines in Bisbee

07:14.030 --> 07:15.140
closed.

07:15.140 --> 07:17.420
Somehow Bisbee did survive.

07:17.420 --> 07:22.190
I can't help but think of it
as the town too loved to die.

07:22.190 --> 07:23.590
Bob Watkins.

07:23.590 --> 07:25.610
You didn't talk
about a deportation.

07:25.610 --> 07:28.820
When Philip said
we're going to keep this quiet,

07:28.820 --> 07:32.390
no one spoke, this town could
keep a secret like nobody else.

07:37.130 --> 07:38.560
Boys and Girls Club in it?

07:38.560 --> 07:40.934
Yeah, I think you guys are
going to be in the background.

07:40.934 --> 07:41.452
Yay!

07:41.452 --> 07:43.440
Isn't that kind of fun?

07:43.440 --> 07:43.940
Yeah.

08:02.530 --> 08:06.220
This big old pile of dirt
here is dump number seven.

08:06.220 --> 08:09.160
What this consists of is
everything that was taken out

08:09.160 --> 08:12.610
of the big open pit,
Lavender and Sacramento

08:12.610 --> 08:15.640
pits, and also from
underground in the mines.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.780
You have to store
the dirt someplace,

08:17.780 --> 08:20.440
and this is one of many places
that they stored the dirt here

08:20.440 --> 08:21.640
in Bisbee.

08:21.640 --> 08:28.168
When the last mine shut down
in 1975, it was catastrophic.

08:28.168 --> 08:30.580
A mining town without
a mine is usually

08:30.580 --> 08:31.910
referred to as a ghost town.

08:39.130 --> 08:41.289
It's a very
interesting situation

08:41.289 --> 08:45.790
because now we've gone from
the richest city in Arizona

08:45.790 --> 08:47.055
to literally the poorest.

08:49.604 --> 08:51.020
There are those
that still believe

08:51.020 --> 08:53.090
the mines are going to
come back and they're

08:53.090 --> 08:55.554
going to save the town.

09:01.820 --> 09:03.800
My name is David Smith.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.200
I'm the newly elected mayor.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.900
I actually still
hear once in a while,

09:08.900 --> 09:10.850
we don't need to
worry about finances.

09:10.850 --> 09:15.810
The mines will never let
anything happen to us.

09:15.810 --> 09:18.290
And that's one of the
biggest issues in governance

09:18.290 --> 09:23.540
is trying to get people to
understand that sugar daddy--

09:23.540 --> 09:28.620
used to be Phelps Dodge, now
Freeport-- isn't there anymore.

09:28.620 --> 09:31.880
Freeport-McMorRan is the
second-largest mining company

09:31.880 --> 09:35.510
in the world, and it
wouldn't matter to them

09:35.510 --> 09:39.170
on a corporate level if
Bisbee had no population

09:39.170 --> 09:42.020
because they've got fences
around their property,

09:42.020 --> 09:43.850
and that copper that's
still in the ground

09:43.850 --> 09:46.460
that some day they'll mine
is going to remain there

09:46.460 --> 09:58.720
just like it's in a bank vault.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.820
My name is Sue Ray.

10:00.820 --> 10:05.770
I was born and raised
in Bisbee, Arizona.

10:05.770 --> 10:12.780
My grandfather came
as a miner in 1915,

10:12.780 --> 10:17.490
and his brother
came shortly after.

10:17.490 --> 10:22.320
My grandfather was deputized
by Sheriff Wheeler,

10:22.320 --> 10:26.580
and he went and
arrested his own brother

10:26.580 --> 10:31.740
and put him on the train and
deported him into New Mexico.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.100
My name is Steven Ray.

10:36.100 --> 10:39.670
I'm born and raised
in Bisbee, Arizona.

10:39.670 --> 10:43.660
I'm a recently retired Cochise
County sheriff's deputy.

10:43.660 --> 10:47.260
Uncle Archie is over here.

10:47.260 --> 10:48.400
And so this was--

10:48.400 --> 10:53.070
I found that in the safety
room up at the Junction Mine.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.690
I think that's him right there.

10:55.690 --> 10:57.880
I was really
shocked when I first

10:57.880 --> 11:02.550
heard that Grandpa
arrested Uncle Archie.

11:02.550 --> 11:07.710
They had to go with what
their conscience told them,

11:07.710 --> 11:12.970
and what they had
been told helped

11:12.970 --> 11:16.270
them to decide which way
they were going to go.

11:16.270 --> 11:20.421
Am I going to go to the right
or am I going to go to the left?

11:20.421 --> 11:20.920
I agree.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.800
I can understand and
sympathize both sides.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.040
I am very proud
of my grandfather.

11:27.040 --> 11:30.040
He felt he was responsible,
along with those

11:30.040 --> 11:32.200
that worked for the
company, to make certain

11:32.200 --> 11:37.120
that we were protected
from becoming taken over

11:37.120 --> 11:45.550
by the socialists, by communism,
that he had to go and arrest

11:45.550 --> 11:49.130
his own brother and
send his brother out

11:49.130 --> 11:55.280
into the unknown world, not
realizing that they would never

11:55.280 --> 11:57.837
see each other again.

11:57.837 --> 11:59.670
Uncle Archie's-- Uncle
Archie's right there.

11:59.670 --> 12:00.253
--right there.

12:00.253 --> 12:04.835
And there was some
resemblance between the two.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.590
Yeah, there is.

12:10.590 --> 12:12.690
Hearing the story,
and myself as being

12:12.690 --> 12:16.686
a retired deputy from the
sheriff's office, it was tough.

12:16.686 --> 12:18.810
I mean, even thinking about
having to go and arrest

12:18.810 --> 12:22.980
my own brother, to do that,
I don't know how he did it.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.530
My name is Mel Ray.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.050
My great-grandfather
was deputized.

12:31.050 --> 12:34.170
My great-uncle was not.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.100
I see both sides.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.950
The people that
were deputized, they

12:37.950 --> 12:39.900
were told they have
this authority.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.600
I can see where they would
act on that authority.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.430
Those that were
being rounded up,

12:44.430 --> 12:46.710
I can see why they were
protesting for higher wages.

12:46.710 --> 12:50.590
I can see why they wanted a
safer working environment.

12:50.590 --> 12:53.190
So I truly am neutral
on the subject

12:53.190 --> 12:55.300
because I see both sides,
the good and the bad.

12:58.740 --> 13:02.760
Welcome to the Copper Chronicle
on KBRP Community Radio.

13:02.760 --> 13:06.420
I'm your host, Charles Berthea.

13:06.420 --> 13:09.250
"All women and children
keep off streets today."

13:12.340 --> 13:14.960
I'm going to start
the whole thing again.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.560
When I first started producing
the show, writing this show,

13:18.560 --> 13:24.470
I made a list of subjects, but
I avoided this one until now.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.570
We decided that we
needed to tell the story,

13:26.570 --> 13:28.730
and there's a reason for that.

13:28.730 --> 13:32.060
"All women and children
keep off streets today."

13:32.060 --> 13:34.250
The bold headline in
the Bisbee Daily Review

13:34.250 --> 13:38.870
on the morning of July 12,
1917 was both an announcement

13:38.870 --> 13:41.060
and a warning.

13:41.060 --> 13:44.210
Bisbee is a town just
seven miles from Mexico

13:44.210 --> 13:47.800
that rests on stories
of its lively past.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.870
But there is one that
stands apart from the rest.

13:50.870 --> 13:54.860
It is the story of the day
that Bisbee changed forever.

13:54.860 --> 13:59.870
At 6:30 AM on Thursday,
July 12, 1917, miners

13:59.870 --> 14:02.450
on strike against the
copper-mining companies

14:02.450 --> 14:05.270
were roused out of
bed by armed loyalists

14:05.270 --> 14:08.570
and taken to the
post office plaza.

14:08.570 --> 14:12.050
The removers, Sheriff
Wheeler's loyal Americans,

14:12.050 --> 14:15.860
were citizens and residents who
had volunteered or were invited

14:15.860 --> 14:18.620
to help put an end to
the menace they believed

14:18.620 --> 14:21.410
the striking workers
had become to the town

14:21.410 --> 14:24.090
and its productive,
patriotic way of life.

14:41.140 --> 14:46.420
OK ladies and gentlemen,
we're almost all the way in.

14:46.420 --> 14:47.795
Want to ring the bell.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.640
OK, hang on you guys.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.550
We're going in.

15:17.070 --> 15:19.230
The Bisbee deportation
seemed to disappear

15:19.230 --> 15:21.180
from the town's history.

15:21.180 --> 15:24.090
The story was rarely
told or mentioned.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.600
It was never referred
to in schools,

15:26.600 --> 15:29.640
and people who remembered that
day did not talk about it.

15:35.650 --> 15:37.600
It was understood that
Phelps Dodge did not

15:37.600 --> 15:40.960
want the story told and
that the ghosts of the past

15:40.960 --> 15:41.890
should remain buried.

15:46.510 --> 15:50.530
In a company town, the
company makes the rules.

15:50.530 --> 15:52.190
It was best to move on.

18:04.425 --> 18:07.950
My name's Fernando
Serrano I'll be

18:07.950 --> 18:11.310
playing a miner in the
Bisbee deportation.

18:52.650 --> 18:57.120
Violence is necessary
to tame the wilderness,

18:57.120 --> 19:01.890
to tame the savages, to
tame the desert itself.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.410
My name is Chris Deentz.

19:09.410 --> 19:12.080
I got here in 1980.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.390
We were birdwatching
in the Chiricahuas

19:14.390 --> 19:17.690
and got sprayed by
a skunk, our dog.

19:17.690 --> 19:21.885
So we had to go to Douglas
to get some tomato juice,

19:21.885 --> 19:24.500
and the rest is history,
been here ever since.

19:27.580 --> 19:33.770
We come into Tombstone,
the town too tough to die.

19:33.770 --> 19:37.950
T-shirts now say the
town too dumb to die.

19:37.950 --> 19:41.230
OK folks, that was our ode
to the Second Amendment.

19:41.230 --> 19:42.964
We are the Second
Amendment city.

19:42.964 --> 19:46.450
A round of applause
for Tombstone, Arizona.

19:46.450 --> 19:52.200
In the 1950s, there
were 50 TV Westerns.

19:52.200 --> 19:57.450
OK Corral, Wyatt Earp,
Doc Holiday, these men

19:57.450 --> 20:00.030
had to carry a
gun because it was

20:00.030 --> 20:01.765
part of the gunfighter nation.

20:05.180 --> 20:09.570
People dress up and
become these characters.

20:09.570 --> 20:11.780
And I don't think
it's a time warp.

20:11.780 --> 20:14.340
I don't think it's time travel.

20:14.340 --> 20:16.190
It's alternate history.

20:16.190 --> 20:19.130
It's alternate dream history.

20:19.130 --> 20:25.430
2:00, showtime right
inside the OK Corral.

20:25.430 --> 20:27.680
See Wyatt Earp and
Doc Holiday face off

20:27.680 --> 20:32.000
against the cowboy gang,
coming up soon right

20:32.000 --> 20:37.030
through these double red
doors inside the OK Corral.

20:37.030 --> 20:38.590
Gun fight's at 2:00.

20:44.170 --> 20:45.880
My name's Aaron Gain.

20:45.880 --> 20:49.680
I've been acting
probably all my life.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.090
Started out when I was
about 10 years old,

20:52.090 --> 20:53.760
been doing it ever since.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.410
Been in Tombstone,
Arizona personally

20:56.410 --> 21:00.760
for about 10 years now, working
at the OK Corral just as long.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.260
The character I'm
portraying is AS Embrey.

21:03.260 --> 21:07.750
I'm an IWW organizer,
pretty much a rabble-rouser.

21:07.750 --> 21:10.960
And I don't know too much
about the whole deportation,

21:10.960 --> 21:13.720
but I have a feeling, much
like my job at the OK Corral,

21:13.720 --> 21:15.100
I'm not going to make it.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.878
Something tells me that
I drew the short straw.

21:21.710 --> 21:25.400
The idea that Tombstone
is the fake history

21:25.400 --> 21:29.476
and Bisbee is the real history
has always been kind of a--

21:29.476 --> 21:31.350
it's always kind of been
a mudslinging thing.

21:46.990 --> 21:48.890
Well, the Copper
Queen Hotel was first

21:48.890 --> 21:51.110
built by the Copper
Queen Mining Company

21:51.110 --> 21:53.000
to house investors for the mine.

21:55.650 --> 21:57.830
Recently in the
last 30 years, it's

21:57.830 --> 22:01.020
gotten more noticed
for its ghosts.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.440
Yeah, usually right
around here in this corner

22:07.440 --> 22:12.229
is where they usually see the
shadow of the smoking man.

22:12.229 --> 22:14.770
It's usually here for a couple
of seconds and then it's gone.

22:14.770 --> 22:16.080
There's a lot of energy
in here, and that's

22:16.080 --> 22:18.080
one thing I noticed when
I started working here.

22:28.620 --> 22:32.430
Harry Wheeler was sheriff
of Cochise County stationed

22:32.430 --> 22:36.540
in Tombstone 35 miles away.

22:36.540 --> 22:39.120
The idea of going door
to door at gunpoint

22:39.120 --> 22:40.860
and rounding people up--

22:40.860 --> 22:42.600
what if people don't round up?

22:42.600 --> 22:46.170
What if they start
shooting back?

22:46.170 --> 22:49.590
How bad can it go trying
to put them into rail cars?

22:49.590 --> 22:52.730
It is said that
Sheriff Wheeler was

22:52.730 --> 22:56.130
a small man, 5 foot
2", about 140 pounds,

22:56.130 --> 22:57.870
kind of walked like a woman.

22:57.870 --> 23:01.980
Now I'm 6' 2", 200
pounds, and I've never

23:01.980 --> 23:03.870
been told that I
walk like a woman.

23:03.870 --> 23:09.480
Anyway, I do appreciate this
chance to play Sheriff Wheeler,

23:09.480 --> 23:13.160
and he did believe
in what he was doing.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.740
He thought that he had
a near riot on his hands

23:16.740 --> 23:18.510
and he had to do
something to stop it.

23:21.450 --> 23:24.930
Then we have the border
patrol patrolling

23:24.930 --> 23:28.441
our everyday movement.

23:28.441 --> 23:29.440
I don't think that's it.

23:37.620 --> 23:41.460
I was born in Tucson, Arizona.

23:41.460 --> 23:45.230
I grew up in Naco,
Sonora, a border town

23:45.230 --> 23:49.330
seven miles away from Bisbee.

23:49.330 --> 23:53.750
I grew up there till I
was about five years old.

23:53.750 --> 23:59.070
Then I came to Bisbee
to go to school.

23:59.070 --> 24:01.520
Oh my God, there's Bean,
Spunky's sugar mama.

24:04.410 --> 24:05.544
He's got a sugar mama.

24:09.340 --> 24:10.553
Hello friend.

24:10.553 --> 24:11.386
How you doing buddy?

24:11.386 --> 24:11.800
Good.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.070
How are you?

24:12.070 --> 24:12.569
Good.

24:12.569 --> 24:13.300
How you doing?

24:13.300 --> 24:13.900
Good.

24:13.900 --> 24:14.890
What's up?

24:14.890 --> 24:17.170
I come here for some jasper.

24:17.170 --> 24:21.651
When I was 15, I found
a place in old Bisbee.

24:21.651 --> 24:22.990
I found a job.

24:27.350 --> 24:32.600
And I've met so many beautiful
people here in Bisbee.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.700
They were willing
to water your garden

24:34.700 --> 24:35.810
if you water their garden.

24:44.850 --> 24:46.017
Cheers.

24:46.017 --> 24:46.517
Cheers!

24:54.150 --> 24:57.210
I mean, I think we just
scream that we're gay.

24:57.210 --> 24:59.860
You know, I had never even
heard about the deportation

24:59.860 --> 25:04.380
until I met you guys, and I've
been living here my whole life.

25:04.380 --> 25:07.560
But it was something that I
wasn't really interested in.

25:11.340 --> 25:15.905
I wouldn't consider
myself politically active.

25:15.905 --> 25:18.200
It just seems like a
lot of fucking fighting,

25:18.200 --> 25:20.176
a lot of fighting.

26:02.166 --> 26:07.080
I'm Mike Anderson, historian for
Warren Ballpark here in Bisbee.

26:07.080 --> 26:10.910
This ballpark was
built in June 1909,

26:10.910 --> 26:14.480
and it's the oldest
continuously operated

26:14.480 --> 26:17.390
baseball field, football
field, multisport facility

26:17.390 --> 26:19.100
in the United States.

26:19.100 --> 26:23.290
And in July 1917,
these grandstands

26:23.290 --> 26:26.495
served as the amphitheater for
a genuine American tragedy.

26:30.900 --> 26:33.960
And if we'd been there
on July 12, 1917,

26:33.960 --> 26:36.640
what we would have seen
was family members,

26:36.640 --> 26:39.990
friends, people on
both sides, armed

26:39.990 --> 26:43.020
guards all the way around
the ballpark, a machine gun

26:43.020 --> 26:45.310
on the roof of what's now
city hall, the building

26:45.310 --> 26:46.560
in back of the grandstands.

26:50.540 --> 26:53.480
This is the focal point of
the deportation right here.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.850
This is where they were
all brought and forced

26:55.850 --> 26:57.410
to make that terrible
decision as to

26:57.410 --> 26:59.900
whether or not they would
return to work or be

26:59.900 --> 27:01.220
exiled from Bisbee forever.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.320
Please tell me what law
they were enforcing.

27:07.320 --> 27:10.470
What Arizona Revised Statute
were they operating under?

27:10.470 --> 27:12.150
Do you know what
their answer was--

27:12.150 --> 27:13.470
the law of necessity.

27:13.470 --> 27:16.410
Can you please find
that in the ARS title

27:16.410 --> 27:19.177
13 criminal code,
the law of necessity?

27:26.980 --> 27:36.750
I'm Laurie McKenna, and I've
been in Bisbee since 2002.

27:36.750 --> 27:40.650
This project is called
The Undesirables.

27:40.650 --> 27:44.750
It was a term used by the
government or antiunion

27:44.750 --> 27:49.890
or companies about immigrants
that were undesirable

27:49.890 --> 27:55.440
or people that were
anarchists or socialists.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.590
They were accused of
being the IWW, which

27:58.590 --> 28:03.190
is one of the most radical
unions to ever exist.

28:03.190 --> 28:05.380
The people that remained
after the deportation

28:05.380 --> 28:08.970
were the ones that
drove people out.

28:08.970 --> 28:13.440
So the cover up-- not a
cover up, but the avoidance

28:13.440 --> 28:17.490
of this historic event
was because there

28:17.490 --> 28:22.350
were relatives of people
who felt 100% justified.

28:22.350 --> 28:25.555
Yeah, I think the
centennial is making

28:25.555 --> 28:27.180
people talk about
this in a way that it

28:27.180 --> 28:28.300
hasn't been talked about.

28:36.420 --> 28:39.600
Morning everyone and welcome
to this meeting of the Bisbee

28:39.600 --> 28:42.430
Deportation
Centennial Committee.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.370
It's good to have
all of you here.

28:44.370 --> 28:48.360
I would like for us to
go around and briefly do

28:48.360 --> 28:50.897
an update of what our
various projects are

28:50.897 --> 28:52.230
and the things that we're doing.

28:52.230 --> 28:55.230
I'm working on what
happened to the deportees.

28:55.230 --> 28:58.170
I think we're going to be
able to portray the deportees

28:58.170 --> 29:00.930
themselves in a much
more accurate light.

29:00.930 --> 29:06.430
So I wanted to do something
on the actual day of July 12.

29:06.430 --> 29:10.380
People are going to be
doing theatrical vignettes.

29:10.380 --> 29:15.630
This is a slice, and this man
is holding a gun to his back

29:15.630 --> 29:17.730
and pushing him along.

29:17.730 --> 29:21.270
This is the first round I did
on the banners using that logo

29:21.270 --> 29:23.130
so you can see how it looks.

29:23.130 --> 29:25.470
When you go through
that list of deputies,

29:25.470 --> 29:28.680
you see that there
is one Slovak name.

29:28.680 --> 29:31.500
Everybody else is
an Anglo Saxon.

29:31.500 --> 29:35.430
So my conclusion after all of
this research, the deportation

29:35.430 --> 29:38.460
was not a response
to a labor action.

29:38.460 --> 29:42.060
It was that to a limited
extent, but it was also

29:42.060 --> 29:44.130
in the nature of an
ethnic cleansing.

29:44.130 --> 29:48.090
My conclusion is that Walter
Douglas decided, sure,

29:48.090 --> 29:49.830
let's make this
an American camp.

29:49.830 --> 29:52.080
Let's get all these
aliens out of here.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.670
I just start reading
more about this

29:53.670 --> 29:56.160
and this is what
we're talking about.

29:56.160 --> 29:59.250
Who defines who's American?

29:59.250 --> 30:03.105
And in doing so, it ain't
you and it ain't you,

30:03.105 --> 30:04.730
and we're going to
get you out of town.

30:04.730 --> 30:06.020
I mean, it's like, wow.

30:06.020 --> 30:09.070
Our next meeting is two
weeks from today, April 14.

30:09.070 --> 30:11.810
We will be honoring Abraham
Lincoln's assassination

30:11.810 --> 30:13.385
and the sinking of the Titanic.

30:18.020 --> 30:19.341
Life has got to move on.

30:26.570 --> 30:31.020
What I'm doing is I'm looking
for any loose material or rocks

30:31.020 --> 30:32.645
that I've loosened
up due to air slack.

30:39.340 --> 30:39.840
Hello.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.320
My name is Doug Graham.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.730
We're inside the Queen Mine.

30:44.730 --> 30:49.040
My family started working in the
mines here in Bisbee in 1883.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.900
And great-grandfather,
grandfather, and father

30:51.900 --> 30:54.080
have all worked underground.

30:54.080 --> 30:57.160
Dad, one hell of a miner
because when I was a kid,

30:57.160 --> 30:58.210
that's what he was.

30:58.210 --> 31:00.236
He was just a miner.

31:00.236 --> 31:02.490
Hi, I'm Dick Graham.

31:02.490 --> 31:06.370
This is my mining world.

31:06.370 --> 31:09.345
I worked in the mines
for some 58 years

31:09.345 --> 31:12.806
in total, starting
at the very lowest,

31:12.806 --> 31:18.146
lowest position possible, just
cleaning mud off the track.

31:18.146 --> 31:22.370
But when I retired, I
was a company president.

31:22.370 --> 31:25.340
This is the boss's desk.

31:25.340 --> 31:27.762
This was used by the
shift bosses underground

31:27.762 --> 31:29.345
to do their paperwork
and the reports.

31:31.910 --> 31:35.330
People are willing to talk
about the deportation.

31:35.330 --> 31:40.584
All my life it was, you
just really didn't do it.

31:40.584 --> 31:42.000
Are you going to
feel that you did

31:42.000 --> 31:46.210
something wrong or your father
or grandfather did something?

31:46.210 --> 31:50.570
No, they were right,
so it's very one sided.

31:53.862 --> 31:56.320
I'm on the mining company, so
I don't that one.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.400
I really were.

31:58.400 --> 32:02.320
IWW was just too radical,
too much for people

32:02.320 --> 32:05.080
to accept at the time--

32:05.080 --> 32:07.210
my opinion, yeah.

32:07.210 --> 32:09.090
Exit phone, just checking it.

32:09.090 --> 32:09.970
OK, bye.

32:15.437 --> 32:19.330
It was not an
anti-immigrant move.

32:19.330 --> 32:23.020
It was not a labor-busting move.

32:23.020 --> 32:29.260
It was, let's make our
communities safe for the women,

32:29.260 --> 32:31.750
for the children, for the mines.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.825
Let's support the war
effort in Europe, our sons

32:34.825 --> 32:38.010
that we sent over.

32:38.010 --> 32:40.260
My father has told
me a lot of stories

32:40.260 --> 32:42.900
that he has heard
from miners that he

32:42.900 --> 32:47.035
worked with that lived
it or somehow experienced

32:47.035 --> 32:49.260
the deportation.

32:49.260 --> 32:55.020
I have to remember, first off,
my father is a procompany man.

32:55.020 --> 32:58.140
I have to also remember
those people telling

32:58.140 --> 33:00.922
the stories are in Bisbee.

33:00.922 --> 33:02.505
In other words, they
weren't deported.

33:06.910 --> 33:10.890
During the deportation,
about 90% of the deportees

33:10.890 --> 33:14.040
were born outside
the United States.

33:14.040 --> 33:20.090
They claim 34 nationalities,
but fully half of those deported

33:20.090 --> 33:23.490
were either Mexican
or Eastern European,

33:23.490 --> 33:27.182
the men who had always been at
the margins of the white man's

33:27.182 --> 33:27.682
camp.

33:30.520 --> 33:33.802
The spirit of--

33:33.802 --> 33:35.730
ah.

33:41.380 --> 33:41.880
What is it?

33:41.880 --> 33:43.440
Solidarity.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.670
Solidarity, OK.

33:49.500 --> 33:54.280
Well, my mother was
deported when I was seven,

33:54.280 --> 33:56.660
and she went to prison
in Mexico for 11 years.

33:59.350 --> 34:05.750
So I guess there's a connection,
but what she was doing

34:05.750 --> 34:07.820
and the work she was
doing was illegal,

34:07.820 --> 34:10.545
and it was drugwise related.

34:10.545 --> 34:14.449
And so it wasn't like they were
just trying to make-- well,

34:14.449 --> 34:16.500
I guess she was trying
to make a living, but--

34:20.020 --> 34:21.850
You have to process
anger, you know?

34:21.850 --> 34:24.690
You can't just act upon it.

34:32.380 --> 34:37.429
I feel like if we
just relive it again,

34:37.429 --> 34:38.732
it's going to keep happening.

34:51.498 --> 34:53.540
A lot of people appear
here and they're on stage.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.955
In the big cities where
they're from no one

34:58.955 --> 35:00.420
would even give
them a second look,

35:00.420 --> 35:05.112
but here everybody
looks at them.

35:05.112 --> 35:07.970
They live in story books.

35:07.970 --> 35:12.990
This here was maybe
45 years ago--

35:12.990 --> 35:16.282
57 years ago.

35:16.282 --> 35:17.740
What are you doing
in that picture?

35:17.740 --> 35:18.780
Riding bulls.

35:21.572 --> 35:23.780
I have all this stuff out
because I like to remind me

35:23.780 --> 35:25.520
who I am, where I came from.

35:31.490 --> 35:32.080
I'm real.

35:36.274 --> 35:37.321
Looking good man.

35:37.321 --> 35:37.820
OK.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.760
So do you want salad?

38:05.760 --> 38:08.090
No, you just want Grand Canyon?

38:08.090 --> 38:10.740
Let grandma just help
you a little bit.

38:10.740 --> 38:13.800
Where's the Fritos?

38:13.800 --> 38:14.500
At the store.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.010
Oh, OK.

38:17.010 --> 38:20.040
Since this was the
hundredth year,

38:20.040 --> 38:25.120
I wanted to be able to tell
my family's side of the story.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.460
We were good people.

38:26.460 --> 38:27.990
We were honest people.

38:27.990 --> 38:31.080
So one of the things
that we want to do

38:31.080 --> 38:39.320
is to have Mel and Steve play
the parts of their grandfather

38:39.320 --> 38:41.690
and their Uncle Archie.

38:41.690 --> 38:48.280
And their interpretation of
what that morning was like--

38:48.280 --> 38:54.510
and I want to get a feel of
what was actually going on

38:54.510 --> 38:57.080
in their minds and their
hearts that morning.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.080
I would love to do that.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.082
It would be an honor
to be able to do that.

39:00.082 --> 39:00.582
OK.

39:14.966 --> 39:23.010
I'm rubbing this penny, 1917
penny, 1,196 times, one time

39:23.010 --> 39:27.600
for every man that was rounded
up at gunpoint and deported.

39:36.310 --> 39:41.220
When I think about playing
someone during the deportation,

39:41.220 --> 39:42.930
I can't be a wife.

39:42.930 --> 39:46.450
I can't be a whore.

39:46.450 --> 39:50.017
I'd have to be a guy.

39:50.017 --> 39:51.850
I mean, I'd want to be
the photographer that

39:51.850 --> 39:58.510
took the pictures or
one of the IWW guys

39:58.510 --> 40:02.590
that was deported because I
always just work the lowest

40:02.590 --> 40:07.070
jobs to support
myself as an artist.

40:07.070 --> 40:13.990
Definitely have that, both
of those angles in my life.

40:17.930 --> 40:21.920
The deportees are going
to be coming out of here

40:21.920 --> 40:25.630
and march this way.

40:25.630 --> 40:29.354
That must have been
a weird feeling.

40:29.354 --> 40:31.520
I'm sure they were their
friends and neighbors, some

40:31.520 --> 40:34.950
of these folks that
were leading them away.

40:34.950 --> 40:37.820
Getting ready to build some
cattle cars to represent

40:37.820 --> 40:41.900
the Bisbee deportation that
was happening right here

40:41.900 --> 40:45.220
on this site, wow, a
hundred years ago right now.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.780
My dad was a miner.

41:00.780 --> 41:03.180
My grandfather and
my great-grandfather

41:03.180 --> 41:06.820
was deported in the
Bisbee deportation.

41:06.820 --> 41:09.180
So my family's been around
here for a long time,

41:09.180 --> 41:13.800
and I probably would
have been a miner.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.900
But when I was a teenager,
the mine shut down

41:15.900 --> 41:16.950
and I became an artist.

41:43.660 --> 41:44.680
Just curious about him.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.290
All these people
are fascinating,

41:46.290 --> 41:49.072
all the characters, all
the actors in this play.

41:49.072 --> 41:54.107
Trost was a proper German name.

41:54.107 --> 41:56.440
A lot of these names would
be the same names as on here.

41:56.440 --> 42:02.080
Now Nick Trost, maybe
Nick Trossel, or not.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.640
What I'm working on
right now as part

42:03.640 --> 42:05.260
of my participation
in the committee

42:05.260 --> 42:08.680
is researching what happened
to the men who were deported.

42:08.680 --> 42:12.880
The general impression
that the media at that time

42:12.880 --> 42:15.780
gave-- remember, the media
was controlled by the mining

42:15.780 --> 42:21.360
companies in Arizona-- was that
these are wobbly agitators.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.387
That's the impression I
had for a long time too.

42:27.050 --> 42:29.990
This is one of the pamphlets
that the Industrial Workers

42:29.990 --> 42:31.850
of the World were putting
out about the time

42:31.850 --> 42:33.860
of the deportation.

42:33.860 --> 42:39.680
What they do is provide
lots and lots of ammunition

42:39.680 --> 42:41.630
for the mining corporations.

42:41.630 --> 42:44.720
Big Bill Haywood,
the general strike--

42:44.720 --> 42:47.420
shut down industrial
production in America.

42:47.420 --> 42:48.250
Stop the war.

42:53.070 --> 42:57.330
These men were branded as
trying to deliberately sabotage

42:57.330 --> 42:59.010
the war effort.

42:59.010 --> 43:00.780
What ended up happening
is a lot of them

43:00.780 --> 43:06.060
either volunteered for military
service or were drafted.

43:35.750 --> 43:37.500
We're going to make
some differences here.

43:37.500 --> 43:37.920
That's right.

43:37.920 --> 43:38.340
That's right.

43:38.340 --> 43:39.881
We're going to make
some differences.

43:39.881 --> 43:41.970
My good wobblies,
I've come to Bisbee

43:41.970 --> 43:44.880
to say that these mines
belong to the people!

43:46.185 --> 43:49.555
We will win Bisbee
and take down capital.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.090
We are peaceful.

43:53.090 --> 43:58.100
They call us anarchists,
traitors, but we are the mines.

43:58.100 --> 44:01.510
We are the nippers
and the mud diggers.

44:01.510 --> 44:02.470
Mud diggers!

44:02.470 --> 44:05.290
And after all, an
injury to one--

44:05.290 --> 44:09.050
--is an injury to all!

44:09.050 --> 44:11.150
We'll strike for
eight hours at $6.00.

44:11.150 --> 44:12.020
That's right!

44:12.020 --> 44:14.850
And then we'll strike
for six hours at $8.00.

44:14.850 --> 44:18.260
And when we get that, we'll
strike and take over the mine!

44:40.080 --> 44:42.330
The fervor of war
and increased demands

44:42.330 --> 44:44.940
for products and
productivity gave unions

44:44.940 --> 44:48.300
new strength and management,
greater determination

44:48.300 --> 44:50.160
to resist.

44:50.160 --> 44:53.370
In Bisbee, union activity
had been tightly controlled

44:53.370 --> 44:54.950
in the past.

44:54.950 --> 44:58.050
But this was a time of
increasing change in the world,

44:58.050 --> 45:02.550
and workers in the US were
more and more restless.

45:02.550 --> 45:06.750
The IWW became, or at least
was perceived as being,

45:06.750 --> 45:09.309
the biggest threat to
the large companies.

45:15.670 --> 45:19.540
Rumors spread that pro-Germans
had infiltrated the unions.

45:19.540 --> 45:22.420
Some said weapons and dynamite
were cached around town

45:22.420 --> 45:23.950
to be used for sabotage.

45:32.670 --> 45:34.172
I didn't do that.

45:34.172 --> 45:36.577
Just go off on.

45:36.577 --> 45:39.326
Don't touch the bulb
because it might be hot.

45:39.326 --> 45:43.180
Just try to see if it--

45:43.180 --> 45:44.670
That's strange.

45:44.670 --> 45:45.520
That's very strange.

45:45.520 --> 45:48.850
The ghost is here.

45:48.850 --> 45:50.890
It would be hard to
believe that there

45:50.890 --> 45:53.560
weren't weapons and dynamite.

45:53.560 --> 45:55.930
It was, after all,
a mining town,

45:55.930 --> 45:59.230
and many still considered
Arizona to be the Wild West.

46:06.180 --> 46:09.930
I have been informed this day
that a strike is contemplated

46:09.930 --> 46:13.140
in Bisbee by the IWW.

46:13.140 --> 46:15.890
I was asked as to what
stand I would take.

46:15.890 --> 46:18.540
Here is my answer.

46:18.540 --> 46:21.630
I beg those interested
to take notice

46:21.630 --> 46:26.160
that I will deputize every
loyal American in Cochise County

46:26.160 --> 46:30.660
to help me preserve
peace and order.

46:30.660 --> 46:35.820
If I believe that Harry
Wheeler was the bad guy,

46:35.820 --> 46:38.160
I'm not sure I would be
interested in playing

46:38.160 --> 46:39.600
this role.

46:39.600 --> 46:44.020
I like playing this role
because it's a complex part.

46:44.020 --> 46:46.980
He was villainized
and demonized.

46:46.980 --> 46:49.270
History has done that to him.

46:49.270 --> 46:52.650
But I do believe that during
that time he was doing this,

46:52.650 --> 46:55.182
he truly believed in
what he was doing.

47:01.640 --> 47:04.740
Hi, I'm James West.

47:04.740 --> 47:08.110
I am an actor in a film
called The Dutchman,

47:08.110 --> 47:11.000
and this is my
girlfriend's home.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.210
I've been here roughly
about two years,

47:14.210 --> 47:15.800
sit pretty close to the border.

47:15.800 --> 47:18.050
I've got great
views of the wall.

47:18.050 --> 47:19.477
I absolutely love it here.

47:25.450 --> 47:28.420
The character that
I'm going to play,

47:28.420 --> 47:31.410
his name is John C. Greenway.

47:31.410 --> 47:36.280
He was the general manager of
the Calumet and Arizona Mine.

47:36.280 --> 47:39.070
Greenway was the only one
of three mining companies

47:39.070 --> 47:42.400
present at the deportation and
the planning meeting the day

47:42.400 --> 47:43.630
before.

47:43.630 --> 47:46.510
He was indicted for
kidnapping and conspiracy

47:46.510 --> 47:52.200
for his role in the deportation,
but the charges were dropped.

47:52.200 --> 47:55.870
Well, it's certainly
a role to play.

47:55.870 --> 47:59.430
I mean, it said that he was
tall, dashing, and handsome.

47:59.430 --> 48:02.470
I don't know if I
could live up to that.

48:05.660 --> 48:09.050
I started working in the
private prison system,

48:09.050 --> 48:10.790
and I know over
the past few years

48:10.790 --> 48:14.930
there's been lots of controversy
with private prisons.

48:14.930 --> 48:18.500
And for quite a few
years, having a background

48:18.500 --> 48:22.400
in law enforcement, we
actually had the responsibility

48:22.400 --> 48:24.770
of boarding these
people up on planes

48:24.770 --> 48:27.650
and flying them
back to countries

48:27.650 --> 48:30.530
that were in Central America.

48:30.530 --> 48:35.070
And we had both criminal
flights and noncriminal flights.

48:35.070 --> 48:37.040
And you turn your
back for a second

48:37.040 --> 48:40.270
and you'd be surprised
what can happen.

48:40.270 --> 48:45.900
And being on a plane 20,000,
35,000 feet in the air,

48:45.900 --> 48:48.520
it's like a
maximum-security prison.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.180
And so you've got
to be on your toes.

48:50.180 --> 48:53.690
It's not time to think, oh,
I'm doing something great.

48:53.690 --> 48:55.100
You're keeping everybody safe.

48:58.950 --> 49:02.550
All right, you know how I
talked to you about my project,

49:02.550 --> 49:04.410
The Undesirables, right?

49:04.410 --> 49:06.390
And I told you about Rosa McKay.

49:06.390 --> 49:07.650
Rosa McKay, yeah.

49:07.650 --> 49:12.270
She just came and went, and of
course Arizona didn't see her

49:12.270 --> 49:13.830
as a valuable historic fact.

49:13.830 --> 49:15.740
Right, because she's a woman.

49:15.740 --> 49:17.570
Yep, because she was woman.

49:17.570 --> 49:19.120
Well, here's her.

49:19.120 --> 49:21.180
That's my drawing
of her, but there's

49:21.180 --> 49:23.400
only like three pictures
of her that I can find.

49:23.400 --> 49:26.430
She was a legislator
for Cochise.

49:26.430 --> 49:28.710
And then there was
the deportation,

49:28.710 --> 49:30.630
and they ran her out of town.

49:30.630 --> 49:34.380
With this project, this
film is also being made.

49:34.380 --> 49:37.780
They're going to do
recreations of the whole thing,

49:37.780 --> 49:39.420
the whole deportation.

49:39.420 --> 49:44.176
And I thought you'd be like
a really great Rosa McKay.

49:44.176 --> 49:45.570
Hey Sue.

49:45.570 --> 49:47.190
Hi.

49:47.190 --> 49:48.480
So we meet.

49:48.480 --> 49:49.826
Finally.

49:49.826 --> 49:51.890
All right, well, what do
you got going on here?

49:51.890 --> 49:54.830
When he found out that
his brother may come back

49:54.830 --> 49:58.130
for the trial and that he
was going to be indicted

49:58.130 --> 50:01.670
and could go to prison
for kidnapping and all

50:01.670 --> 50:05.540
these other charges, he ran.

50:05.540 --> 50:06.920
He went to Mexico.

50:06.920 --> 50:13.040
So Uncle Archie-- we went to
the city hall and we got a map,

50:13.040 --> 50:16.870
and we found that this is
Uncle Archie's resting place.

50:16.870 --> 50:17.990
Uncle Archie, huh?

50:17.990 --> 50:20.150
And there's been a
hundred years, you know?

50:20.150 --> 50:23.360
It's been a hundred years
since they saw each other.

50:23.360 --> 50:26.240
And not that they're going
to see each other now,

50:26.240 --> 50:28.530
but I feel better.

50:28.530 --> 50:30.980
My mother definitely
brought me into this.

50:30.980 --> 50:34.220
I do not have the drive that
she does on the deportation.

50:34.220 --> 50:38.300
To me, the deportation was
another thing about Bisbee.

50:38.300 --> 50:41.130
I mean, Bisbee has had a mine.

50:41.130 --> 50:42.220
Bisbee had a brothel.

50:42.220 --> 50:43.340
Bisbee had a brewery.

50:43.340 --> 50:46.050
Bisbee had a deportation.

50:46.050 --> 50:47.800
It was just part of Bisbee.

50:52.490 --> 50:53.224
Hola.

50:53.224 --> 50:54.140
Hey, how's I it going?

50:54.140 --> 50:54.350
Good.

50:54.350 --> 50:54.851
How are you?

50:54.851 --> 50:55.350
Good.

50:55.350 --> 50:55.900
James.

50:55.900 --> 50:56.630
Fernando.

50:56.630 --> 50:58.340
Fernando.

50:58.340 --> 51:00.950
So what character are
you on the project?

51:00.950 --> 51:04.454
I'll be playing a Mexican miner.

51:04.454 --> 51:06.560
OK, that's cool.

51:06.560 --> 51:12.200
I'm playing John Greenway,
so I'm like the boss man.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.010
I'm like the guy
who says, hey, I

51:15.010 --> 51:17.600
don't want to deal with
these people, with you

51:17.600 --> 51:19.160
because you're striking.

51:19.160 --> 51:20.930
And I'm like, you know what?

51:20.930 --> 51:23.600
Let's just put these people
on a train and deport them.

51:23.600 --> 51:26.540
It seemed like everyone
that came here pretty much

51:26.540 --> 51:30.320
tried to assimilate
to the culture

51:30.320 --> 51:35.690
that we had established already,
in the 17 and then in the 1800s

51:35.690 --> 51:37.990
and then the turn
of the century.

51:37.990 --> 51:43.089
Well, it's not like they
came here, you know.

51:43.089 --> 51:44.630
It's the white people
that came here.

51:44.630 --> 51:49.950
So then they brought
these customs to them.

51:49.950 --> 51:51.970
It was really great
meeting you, Fernando.

51:51.970 --> 51:54.540
And I guess we'll see you on
the set when we start filming.

51:54.540 --> 51:56.290
Yeah, I look forward
to getting deported.

51:56.290 --> 51:56.790
Me too.

51:56.790 --> 51:58.665
Oh,

51:58.665 --> 51:59.165
Thank you.

51:59.165 --> 52:00.860
I'll try and be
gentle about it, OK?

52:00.860 --> 52:01.789
OK.

52:01.789 --> 52:02.330
Take it easy.

52:02.330 --> 52:02.900
I'm tough.

52:02.900 --> 52:05.280
I got it.

52:27.840 --> 52:33.822
It's really emotional guys,
but really empowering.

52:33.822 --> 52:37.850
Workers
of the world awaken.

52:41.990 --> 52:44.242
Break your chains.

52:44.242 --> 52:47.095
Demand your rights.

52:50.476 --> 53:02.435
All the wealth you make is
taken by exploiting parasites.

53:06.696 --> 53:10.174
It's
for true liberty.

55:13.982 --> 55:18.470
I've never actually had this
conversation with my mother,

55:18.470 --> 55:19.915
so it's sort of really intense.

55:23.420 --> 55:26.670
She was deported when
I was seven years old,

55:26.670 --> 55:29.620
and she was in
prison till I was 18.

55:33.444 --> 55:34.400
I'm sorry.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.356
It's OK.

55:38.710 --> 55:42.620
It's a really weird
relationship that we have.

55:42.620 --> 55:45.690
I feel like, most
of the time, I had

55:45.690 --> 55:47.850
to pretty much nurture myself.

56:01.860 --> 56:05.280
I'm Mary Ellen Suarez Dunlap.

56:05.280 --> 56:10.860
I am one of four children to my
parents that came from Mexico.

56:10.860 --> 56:14.580
And they immigrated and
became naturalized citizens.

56:14.580 --> 56:18.705
And we were born and
raised in Naco, Arizona.

56:18.705 --> 56:19.800
It's a small town.

56:19.800 --> 56:22.530
It is a border town.

56:22.530 --> 56:24.460
And so I'm native.

56:24.460 --> 56:26.340
I'm native to Bisbee.

56:26.340 --> 56:31.440
And I'm presently the
clerk of Superior Court.

56:31.440 --> 56:33.930
It is an elected position.

56:33.930 --> 56:38.310
And matter of fact, I'm
the first Hispanic--

56:38.310 --> 56:41.160
not just Hispanic
woman, but Hispanic--

56:41.160 --> 56:47.130
to win an election countywide,
and the first Republican

56:47.130 --> 56:51.570
to have the county seat as far
as the clerk of Superior Court,

56:51.570 --> 56:55.350
because historically
it's been Democrat.

56:55.350 --> 56:56.180
Hi, babe.

56:56.180 --> 56:57.436
Hi, honey.

56:57.436 --> 56:58.380
Look at you.

56:58.380 --> 57:00.380
It looks like you have
the acting bug now, huh?

57:00.380 --> 57:00.880
Yeah.

57:00.880 --> 57:03.300
I'm an actress, too.

57:03.300 --> 57:06.440
Growing up and watching the
novelas, when you said that,

57:06.440 --> 57:08.910
that kind of struck
that with my mom.

57:08.910 --> 57:13.230
And my family, as you
know, it's a big family,

57:13.230 --> 57:18.640
and we are pretty much
dramatizing it, kind of

57:18.640 --> 57:19.360
like a novela.

57:23.230 --> 57:25.100
Today, we're going
to be filming when

57:25.100 --> 57:26.710
the miners decided to walk out.

57:30.440 --> 57:33.290
It's a little hard
being here knowing,

57:33.290 --> 57:36.410
you know, my dad had
been here for a number

57:36.410 --> 57:37.370
of years working here.

57:37.370 --> 57:40.130
He enjoyed it.

57:40.130 --> 57:42.650
I was just standing
over here by the door

57:42.650 --> 57:44.870
to try to get into
Uncle Archie's head.

57:44.870 --> 57:48.860
And I turned around
and looked, and they've

57:48.860 --> 57:52.160
got the in and out
board for the workers.

57:52.160 --> 57:54.320
I didn't realize it was
here, and I turned around--

57:57.062 --> 57:57.765
I'm sorry.

57:57.765 --> 57:58.820
This is my dad.

58:02.310 --> 58:03.970
He's still got
his name and his--

58:03.970 --> 58:04.950
I'm sorry.

58:08.380 --> 58:10.720
He's still got his
name and his tag

58:10.720 --> 58:14.390
up there showing that he's
out, he's not inside the mine.

58:21.264 --> 58:25.371
I've only been in one
time since Dad's passed.

58:28.020 --> 58:30.470
I want to go back in where
he spent a lot of his time,

58:30.470 --> 58:32.879
where he-- and just a
lot of enjoyment there.

58:37.869 --> 58:39.366
OK.

01:01:05.573 --> 01:01:10.042
It's a union
for true liberty.

01:01:12.868 --> 01:01:20.100
It's a union for you and for me.

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:24.690
It's the worker's
own choice, it's

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:32.387
for girls and for boys who
want freedom from wage slavery.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:47.730
On June 24, the IWW presented
the mining companies

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:51.210
a list of demands, including
safety improvements,

01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:54.510
better working conditions,
and an end to discrimination

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:57.630
against labor organizations
and unequal treatment

01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:59.235
of foreign or minority workers.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.920
The companies
refused all demands.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.930
No surprise there.

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:10.140
And a strike was called.

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:15.767
By June 27, almost half
the workforce had walked.

01:02:35.436 --> 01:02:37.710
If people want to come
here to this country

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.876
and enjoy life,
liberty, freedom,

01:02:41.876 --> 01:02:43.900
we've got to protect it.

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:47.010
We've got to protect
it from the enemy.

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:50.700
And you want to come here and
you want to be a part of that?

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.650
By all means, then.

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:57.250
But you want to come here and
stand in the way of that, well,

01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:59.754
we're just not gonna take that.

01:03:24.654 --> 01:03:26.148
50.

01:03:59.016 --> 01:03:59.690
Play ball!

01:04:03.164 --> 01:04:04.830
Well, on the wall
here in the courtroom,

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:06.780
we have all of the
retired judges.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.137
And we frequently have
a lot of visitors here.

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:10.720
And one of the games
we play with them

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.230
is to have them look at the wall
and to point out to us which

01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:15.940
of the judges they
feel is the one

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:19.313
who is responsible for
haunting this building.

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.810
Most people get it right.

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:23.280
It's the guy right at the top.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.270
It's Judge Ross.

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:27.180
And he was the first judge
to preside in this building

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.670
in 1931 when it opened up.

01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:32.780
People come in and
they smell cigar smoke,

01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:36.315
chairs just sort of go up
or go down, doors close.

01:04:36.315 --> 01:04:38.190
And there have been
people that have actually

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:41.820
seen sort of an apparition of
him in some of these rooms,

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.220
actually sort of seen
like a ghost-like figure.

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.720
I'm guessing the
mining company had

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.000
a lot to do with
financing this building

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.280
because it's built beautifully.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:59.050
This one
apparently engaged.

01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:01.360
What's your last
three words on your?

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.232
Policy of operations unchanged.

01:05:04.232 --> 01:05:05.530
OK, thanks.

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:08.750
The idea was partly
stimulated by my fiancee, who

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:12.630
was having an argument
with a fellow here in town

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:15.630
who wanted to tell both
sides of the story.

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:17.610
And she got enraged
and said, that's

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:21.694
like telling the other side
of the story in the Holocaust.

01:05:21.694 --> 01:05:23.110
She can get a
little over the top.

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:24.670
But when I was
thinking that through

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.520
and we were kind of
jawing it around,

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.580
I thought, well, maybe a
musical is the way to do it.

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:31.800
And you do it not so seriously.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.630
That's what labor
used to do, right?

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:35.580
Even like with
Cesar Chavez, they

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:38.910
used to do little theater things
out in the fields and stuff.

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:40.890
It's a part of this.

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:44.490
For some reason, IWW workers
seemed to write a lot of songs

01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:45.900
and sing a lot of songs.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.300
You don't find too many
capitalists and mining

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.700
companies writing
and singing songs.

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.709
I think I've got
the major part done.

01:05:53.709 --> 01:05:55.500
Writing a song turns
out to be a lot harder

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.500
than I thought it would.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.020
Yeah.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:03.330
We, the titans of
industry, eschew,

01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:06.330
we do, frivolity.

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:09.990
We had been talking about
a reenactment for years.

01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:11.900
And some of the
reaction was, well,

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:15.658
that trivializes the event.

01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:23.330
In order that our employees
and the public of this district

01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:25.730
may know where
this company stands

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:29.510
in relation to certain labor
agitation in this camp,

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:32.240
we desire to make the
following statement.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.610
We refuse to receive
the committee

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:36.950
or to consider their demands.

01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:40.460
This company will never
negotiate with an organization

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:43.760
founded on principles hostile
to good government in times

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:49.010
of peace and treasonable
in times of war.

01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:52.296
Bisbee is the highest
paid camp in the world.

01:06:52.296 --> 01:06:55.130
At Calumet, an Arizona
mining company,

01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:59.990
intends to continue its present
policy of operations unchanged.

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:02.180
In the Shattuck,
Arizona Copper Company

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:05.120
hopes its employees
will repudiate

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:08.960
the conspiratorial
actions of the IWW

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:14.750
by continuing at their
usual occupations.

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:19.690
We, the titans of
industry, eschew,

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:23.800
we do, frivolity.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:29.290
We have mines to run,
leaves us no time for fun.

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:34.720
That's why we, we
don't sing songs.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.680
But if we were to
sing a song, we

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:44.020
would sing God, country,
and most important

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:48.555
of all, the Copper Queen mine.

01:07:48.555 --> 01:07:50.415
Gentlemen.

01:07:50.415 --> 01:07:56.540
God, country,
and the Copper Queen mine.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.442
One more time.

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:06.117
God, country,
and the Copper Queen mine.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:13.530
This is where Walter
Douglas lived in 1817.

01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:18.630
You can just see the
malevolence, the evil emanating

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:20.430
from this building right here.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.140
Cold-blooded man.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.060
Walter Douglas was
the mastermind,

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.010
he was the originator
of the deportation,

01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:27.540
but he always kept
in the shadows.

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:35.490
I think a lot of times
in the narrative,

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:38.910
the blame is placed on the
Sheriff, Sheriff Wheeler,

01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:42.359
but there's no way the Sheriff
could have choreographed

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:43.540
this whole thing.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.950
You know, he had the
power to make this happen.

01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:50.529
Yes, the deportation was awful.

01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:51.029
And--

01:08:51.029 --> 01:08:53.580
So was Walter Douglas.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.930
--yes.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:59.939
But that's one day or
one month or one event.

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:00.810
Year.

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:03.020
And probably the darkest
event in our history.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.790
But without the family,
we wouldn't be here.

01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:07.149
And I love living in Bisbee.

01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:07.649
So.

01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:10.620
I think everyone also has
to own up in this world

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.560
when they really screw up,
when they do something bad.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.810
That has not quite happened yet.

01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:19.470
These arrogant,
eastern elitists who

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:21.630
have absolutely no
connection at all

01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:23.790
to the people who are
digging the stuff out

01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:28.790
of the earth, none, turned this
town into a corporate gulag.

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.689
And if you think
I'm exaggerating,

01:09:30.689 --> 01:09:34.260
you look at how
people were treated

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:38.040
and how due process and
the rule of law was gutted.

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.330
They've been in
the trains already,

01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:49.750
like, I don't know, I
can't remember, 16 hours?

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:53.229
Something crazy.

01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:55.690
Why are you so
passionate about it?

01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:58.000
It's just like for human--

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.220
just for human's
basic rights, or?

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:03.730
It's not just that American kids
aren't getting labor history

01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:06.790
or Bisbee kids don't know
anything about the deportation,

01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:09.910
it's that nobody knows
any of our history at all.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.573
OK, my friend, let's
see what we can do.

01:10:15.573 --> 01:10:19.740
Let's see what we can see.

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:21.950
Wow.

01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:24.260
So we know they
were-- around here's

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.935
where they dropped them off.

01:10:25.935 --> 01:10:27.240
It's hell on earth.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.010
Hell.

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:31.377
Totally, yeah.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.520
I mean, this is what it came to.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:47.040
You know, the Wild West,
cowboys with their guns

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.388
hurting innocent
people at gunpoint.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.580
I guess it's just changing
my outlook and the way

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:00.630
I look at Bisbee.

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:10.710
I feel like it's this
energy in Bisbee.

01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:12.600
There's this really dark energy.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.200
And it's like it can
bring the best out of you,

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.530
but it also can make
you into somebody

01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:20.830
you've never wanted to be.

01:12:25.930 --> 01:12:30.100
It was natural for me to
want the mining company

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:34.510
to have a very legitimate
reason to do this

01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:39.610
and to be in the right because
I was very much raised a company

01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:40.210
kid.

01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:46.080
I've been a company executive,
I've carried the company line

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.100
all my life.

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:50.760
If something wasn't
done, there was going

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.130
to be blood on the streets.

01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:56.490
Truly, there was going to
be blood on the streets.

01:12:56.490 --> 01:12:59.190
My grandfather told me that.

01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:01.740
Here is where they
were being held.

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:05.310
And I'm going to note
that the white bands

01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:09.750
on the arms of the people
represent the individuals who

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:11.310
are doing the collecting.

01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:16.590
And there's a long dissertation
in this publication

01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:22.030
on the law of
necessity, totally based

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:24.880
on the Bisbee deportation.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.070
And I'm sure,
although there's never

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:30.700
been any proof, that the
mining companies were only

01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:35.830
too happy to shake their head
yes when somebody suggested it.

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:38.500
Were they behind it?

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.570
Some will say yes.

01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:42.580
I don't know.

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:44.500
And to me, it makes
no difference,

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:49.160
because it was the right thing
to do to save human lives,

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.870
it was the right thing to
do in a patriotic sense

01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:57.560
to support America's
first big war,

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.740
and it was the right thing
to do to save Bisbee.

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:05.750
Otherwise, it could
have ceased to exist.

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:13.210
So this concept of a
deportation was developed.

01:14:13.210 --> 01:14:19.686
But how do you get 2,000
people to keep a secret?

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:34.170
It's not a coincidence that
it's like I'm sitting here,

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.950
and it's like the
universe is telling me,

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:39.590
OK, you have to
be aware of this,

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:43.450
and you need to
be a part of this.

01:14:47.306 --> 01:14:48.752
Join the strike!

01:14:48.752 --> 01:14:50.680
Come on, join the strike.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:51.644
It's time.

01:14:53.933 --> 01:14:54.815
Strike!

01:14:54.815 --> 01:14:56.164
Strike!

01:14:56.164 --> 01:14:57.092
strike!

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:58.020
Strike!

01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:58.913
Strike!

01:14:58.913 --> 01:14:59.412
Strike!

01:14:59.412 --> 01:14:59.911
Strike!

01:14:59.911 --> 01:15:00.810
Strike!

01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:01.513
Strike!

01:15:01.513 --> 01:15:03.400
Join the strike.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.870
Join the strike.

01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:06.682
Join the strike.

01:15:06.682 --> 01:15:08.618
Join the strike.

01:15:11.522 --> 01:15:13.458
Join the strike.

01:15:13.458 --> 01:15:14.910
Join the strike.

01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:20.710
I'm Dick Graham.

01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:22.450
I'm playing the role
of Walter Douglas.

01:15:38.923 --> 01:15:43.342
Solidarity forever.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:52.810
Solidarity forever.

01:15:56.113 --> 01:16:01.305
Solidarity forever.

01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:10.138
For the union makes us strong.

01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:23.654
Tense, angry, thinking how can
they profane this great song.

01:16:23.654 --> 01:16:29.620
The melody is the Civil
War song, the Battle Hymn

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:31.150
of the Republic.

01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:37.700
And they're profaning it
by making it a union song.

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:41.830
It's like taking Ave Maria and
turning it into a brothel song.

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:50.670
That's from a
management perspective.

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:54.140
And that's my
personal belief, too.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:59.524
So it's easy to identify,
very easy to identify.

01:16:59.524 --> 01:17:01.470
And that's what I
felt in the '60s when

01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:07.180
there were the anti-Vietnam
demonstrations.

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:10.595
I was on the other side.

01:17:10.595 --> 01:17:13.510
Tell me what you're thinking.

01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:19.060
You hit a point where you have
to make a decision between what

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:22.830
is right and what is legal.

01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:26.480
They are not always the same.

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:31.090
And you must always
do what is right.

01:17:31.090 --> 01:17:33.130
That is the message
that has carried

01:17:33.130 --> 01:17:36.210
through the centuries
in protest movements,

01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:40.470
in progress movements,
in religious movements,

01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:44.800
in anything, is
doing what is right.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:48.610
Yes, I know, I have no
doubt he was conflicted.

01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:51.220
Was he behind this?

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:52.016
I don't know.

01:17:52.016 --> 01:17:53.140
Did he have a finger in it?

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:55.450
Oh, I bet he had
more than a finger.

01:17:55.450 --> 01:18:00.140
But in any event, nobody knows
where Walter Douglas was.

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:04.540
Was he sitting in his mansion
at the end of the vista?

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:08.470
Was he in his private railroad
car on the siding somewhere?

01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:10.580
Or was he in New York?

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:13.990
He was conspicuously absent.

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:18.010
I cannot believe it was
something that he nor any

01:18:18.010 --> 01:18:24.010
of the others involved took
lightly, a responsibility.

01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:28.141
You cannot compromise
with a rattlesnake.

01:18:28.141 --> 01:18:32.208
Those were the words
of Walter Douglas.

01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:37.520
Things got worse.

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.900
The Citizens Protective League,
an anti-union organization

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.540
formed during a
previous labor dispute,

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:46.330
was reactivated by
local businessmen

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:49.690
and put under the control of
Cochise County Sheriff Harry

01:18:49.690 --> 01:18:50.620
Wheeler.

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.890
He was the go-to guy for
management in Bisbee,

01:18:53.890 --> 01:18:59.020
a reminder of just how powerful
the mining companies were.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:04.540
Greenway School, built by the
Calumet and Arizona Mining

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:13.450
Company by the Greenway family
and opened for first students

01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:16.530
in 1917, 100 years ago.

01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:18.590
Same year as the
Bisbee deportation.

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.930
Beautiful floors.

01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:28.440
Elementary school now,
closed for the summer.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.040
No students.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.110
Awfully nice floors.

01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:40.570
They have lasted well.

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.840
I, Harry C. Wheeler,
Sheriff of Cochise County,

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:03.090
state of Arizona, deputize you
my lawful deputy in all matters

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:04.430
as if myself were present.

01:20:11.164 --> 01:20:13.088
Your list.

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:18.580
I, Harry C. Wheeler,
Sheriff of Cochise County,

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:23.320
state of Arizona, deputize you
my lawful deputy in all matters

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:26.193
as if myself were present.

01:20:32.085 --> 01:20:35.522
Your list.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.110
I, Harry C. Wheeler,
Sheriff of Cochise County,

01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:50.490
state of Arizona, deputize you
my lawful deputy in all matters

01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:53.856
as if myself were present.

01:21:03.536 --> 01:21:06.790
I, Harry C. Wheeler,
Sheriff of Cochise County,

01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:11.720
state of Arizona, deputize you
my lawful deputy in all matters

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:14.600
as if myself were present.

01:21:21.724 --> 01:21:23.688
Your list.

01:21:28.176 --> 01:21:32.136
Wheeler, let's get
these rattlesnakes.

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:42.730
I'll be playing Rosa McKay.

01:21:42.730 --> 01:21:47.110
And right now, I'm busy
making a hat, a cloche hat.

01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:49.330
And I'm starting with
this beautiful material,

01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:52.060
but it's got a lot of
sequins and sparkly things.

01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:56.950
And Rosa does not strike me
as the sequiny, sparkly type

01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:59.330
of woman.

01:21:59.330 --> 01:22:05.200
I am a Bisbee
miner, Ben Johnson is my name.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:10.310
I came here from Nogales
to work the company claim.

01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:15.790
I left my wife with two young
boys and headed out one day.

01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:22.340
That was five long years ago
I came here on that train.

01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:27.430
I joined up with the union
when I came to this town.

01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:32.250
I signed on with a company
and made my way around.

01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:36.810
They gave me sticks of dynamite
to bring the mountains down,

01:22:36.810 --> 01:22:41.610
and I work as hard as any
man tearing up the ground.

01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:46.770
Then the wobblies
called a meeting

01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:49.530
and called a picket line.

01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:54.660
We had to show the company
their policies weren't right.

01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:57.530
But the Great World
War was raging then,

01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:59.880
and we had our own fight.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.510
And then the company
came up with a plan

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:04.125
and tried to break the strike.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:14.610
In the early hours of dawn,
they snuck up on their prey.

01:23:14.610 --> 01:23:17.014
The vigilantes killed
James

01:23:17.014 --> 01:23:19.484
when he shot McCray.

01:23:19.484 --> 01:23:24.360
1,182 were rounded up that day.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:28.960
And then they marched us into
Warren and put us on a train.

01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:35.390
I want to welcome all
of you out this morning.

01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:38.030
We're going to
place the headstone

01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:40.424
on Uncle Archie's grave.

01:23:40.424 --> 01:23:42.890
United with your brothers.

01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:49.156
We're going to lay the headstone
for Grandpa Edward Leslie Cook.

01:23:49.156 --> 01:23:52.560
Well, that
was 20 years ago.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.050
I still recall that day.

01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:57.580
I found work in a factory.

01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.320
10 years I stayed away.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:05.630
They say time heals everything,
but some things stay the same.

01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:10.902
When I came back to Bisbee,
I had to change my name.

01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:19.220
I am a Bisbee miner,
John Benson is my name.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:24.210
I came here from Nogales
to work the company claim.

01:24:24.210 --> 01:24:29.730
My boys are grown with
families, Ruth died in '28.

01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:34.640
25 long years ago, I
came here on that train.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.468
I'm done.

01:25:01.746 --> 01:25:02.734
Had two marks.

01:25:02.734 --> 01:25:05.204
They're a little deep,
but I think it's OK.

01:25:05.204 --> 01:25:06.686
OK.

01:25:06.686 --> 01:25:08.162
I'll take it easy.

01:25:08.162 --> 01:25:08.662
Thank you.

01:25:08.662 --> 01:25:10.144
Uh-huh.

01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:19.990
This is every single
man that was deported.

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:22.386
And I did a penny rubbing
for each one of them.

01:25:22.386 --> 01:25:24.866
Whoa.

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:37.440
Man, I got to be
up here somewhere.

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:41.390
It is very possible that
I'm on the other wall.

01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:42.780
Oh, nope, got him.

01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:44.890
There it is.

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:47.750
That's me.

01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:49.100
That's crazy.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:50.840
Members of St.
John's Church have

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:56.620
gathered to read the names
of the deportees from Bisbee.

01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.270
Harry Tomar.

01:25:58.270 --> 01:26:00.220
Seamul Tomich.

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.655
Tony Tomacich.

01:26:01.655 --> 01:26:03.850
Tony Tomon.

01:26:03.850 --> 01:26:05.660
Peter Toomey.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.130
Nick Trassell.

01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:10.220
Felicto Mentiejo.

01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:12.350
Calistro Montez.

01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:14.300
Francisco Montoya.

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.100
Thomas Rayden.

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:17.330
Raymond Patton.

01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:18.320
Roy Patton.

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:19.940
Gus Paul.

01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:21.910
Pisano.

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.010
John Pisavio.

01:26:24.010 --> 01:26:26.180
Eli Pitcamo.

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.010
Peter Pledge.

01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:30.422
Tony Pledge.

01:26:30.422 --> 01:26:32.780
Milo.

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.850
Francisco Rodriguez.

01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:37.330
Francisco Eric Rodriguez.

01:26:37.330 --> 01:26:39.600
Guadalupe Rodriguez.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.730
Jose Rodriguez.

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:42.560
Juan Rodriguez.

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:49.030
And all the men whose names
do not appear on this list,

01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:51.950
you are not forgotten, either.

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:12.248
Workers saw
the world awakened.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:21.050
Break your chains,
demand your rights.

01:27:24.356 --> 01:27:36.541
All the wealth you make is
taken by exploiting parasites.

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:52.980
Shall you kneel in deep
submission from your cradles

01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:55.353
to your graves?

01:27:58.529 --> 01:28:10.876
Is the height of your ambition
to be good and willing slaves?

01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:39.790
As July 11 turned into July
12, the Bisbee deportation

01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:40.939
got underway.

01:28:43.239 --> 01:28:46.690
Everywhere, men whose names were
listed were roused from beds,

01:28:46.690 --> 01:28:50.700
pulled from houses, and
forced into streets.

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:54.150
Many were not strikers,
or even miners.

01:28:54.150 --> 01:28:56.520
Expressing support for
the strike or strikers

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:59.640
was enough to be taken.

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:03.240
From downtown Bisbee,
the march began.

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:06.840
After nearly four miles, the
detainees arrived in Warren

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.560
and were herded together
in the ballpark.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.690
The day that would forever
be remembered and debated

01:29:14.690 --> 01:29:17.260
had dawned.

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:21.224
The Bisbee deportation
was underway.

01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:35.535
So, son, this gives
your special rights.

01:29:35.535 --> 01:29:36.035
Lawful.

01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:41.720
We want to be sure that
everything that we do

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.744
is according to the law.

01:29:55.253 --> 01:29:56.170
OK, ready?

01:29:56.170 --> 01:29:56.670
Ready.

01:29:56.670 --> 01:29:57.868
Let's do it.

01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:17.400
What we're doing here
today, July 12, 2017,

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.346
is about remembrance.

01:30:20.346 --> 01:30:26.554
It's an event where people
had their lives torn apart.

01:30:31.170 --> 01:30:33.040
Reading about it is amazing.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.510
They cut off communications.

01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:40.200
They commandeered the
telephone lines, the telegraph

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:41.400
in and out of town.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:45.480
Nobody knew about
it..

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:46.890
End discrimination now!

01:30:46.890 --> 01:30:49.240
End
discrimination now!

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.760
End discrimination now!

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.580
End
discrimination now?

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:54.880
End discrimination now!

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.378
End
discrimination now!

01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:08.686
Strike!

01:31:08.686 --> 01:31:09.186
Strike!

01:31:09.186 --> 01:31:10.170
Strike!

01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:11.154
Strike!

01:31:11.154 --> 01:31:12.138
Strike!

01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:23.856
Solidarity forever.

01:31:23.856 --> 01:31:27.768
The union makes us strong.

01:31:27.768 --> 01:31:31.680
Oh, solidarity forever.

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.705
Vagrants!

01:31:32.705 --> 01:31:34.640
You're all under arrest.

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:37.676
All of you are under arrest.

01:31:39.452 --> 01:31:41.200
This is a peaceful strike.

01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:57.940
tight circle.

01:32:05.998 --> 01:32:10.350
I came to Bisbee in the 1980s
as a student from Lebanon.

01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:12.630
I was mesmerized.

01:32:12.630 --> 01:32:15.310
I fell in love with it.

01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:17.760
Then, yeah, I would
have been scared,

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:20.580
I would have been intimidated.

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:23.610
I will never not serve
someone because someone

01:32:23.610 --> 01:32:25.840
is telling me not to.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.420
This is-- it's given.

01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:30.340
That's part of me.

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.834
I will never, even if
they put me on a plane.

01:32:32.834 --> 01:32:33.750
You're coming with us.

01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:34.690
Why?

01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:35.841
What did I do?

01:32:35.841 --> 01:32:36.340
No!

01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:36.839
Come on.

01:32:36.839 --> 01:32:37.970
I'm just doing my job.

01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:39.890
Leave me alone!

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:47.318
Coming in.

01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:52.258
Come on out.

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:54.728
Open up.

01:32:54.728 --> 01:32:57.692
Come with us.

01:32:57.692 --> 01:33:00.162
Come on, you.

01:33:02.632 --> 01:33:04.930
Coming with us,.

01:33:04.930 --> 01:33:05.430
What?

01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:06.816
What's this all about?

01:33:06.816 --> 01:33:10.018
What's going on?

01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:56.380
Archie.

01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.600
It's Les.

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.070
Let's go.

01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:02.820
Arch.

01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:03.990
What's going on?

01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:05.040
What's with the gun?

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:05.689
We gotta go.

01:34:05.689 --> 01:34:06.480
Where are we going?

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.030
Get dressed.

01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.680
We gotta go.

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.809
I'm dressed.

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:09.600
Where are we going?

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.578
We're going to the ballpark.

01:34:11.578 --> 01:34:13.060
Get your hat.

01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:14.404
Let's go.

01:34:14.404 --> 01:34:17.958
I don't understand
why we have to go.

01:34:17.958 --> 01:34:20.183
Shouldn't have been
with the wobblies.

01:34:20.183 --> 01:34:22.220
I just wanted to hear
what they had to say.

01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:24.440
I can't believe my own
brother is doing this to me.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.356
Your brother is keeping
you safe from the mob.

01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:04.310
I am Rosa McKay, and
I'm a state legislator,

01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:06.856
and I have a right to
deliver this telegraph.

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:11.970
People were just asking
her, Rosa, please help us.

01:35:11.970 --> 01:35:13.700
She was a state legislator.

01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:20.560
And so she came downtown
to wire President Wilson,

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.114
and they wouldn't let her.

01:35:22.114 --> 01:35:24.798
Just wouldn't let her do it.

01:35:36.774 --> 01:35:38.271
You need to calm down.

01:35:47.253 --> 01:35:48.750
Take it easy.

01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:49.748
Calm down.

01:35:49.748 --> 01:35:51.245
Calm down.

01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:53.740
Follow along, boys.

01:35:56.235 --> 01:35:57.526
Take it easy.

01:35:57.526 --> 01:35:58.734
Everything will be explained.

01:35:58.734 --> 01:36:00.375
I have family in there.

01:36:00.375 --> 01:36:02.686
I understand, ma'am.

01:36:17.446 --> 01:36:22.140
About time we do something
with these rattlesnakes.

01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:26.474
Finally, we're getting them
out of town, where they belong.

01:36:26.474 --> 01:36:31.076
Give them to the army, see
what the army can do with them.

01:36:31.076 --> 01:36:32.560
Un-American suckers.

01:36:36.871 --> 01:36:39.474
Yeah, look at them.

01:36:39.474 --> 01:36:43.780
Ever see such a motley crew?

01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:44.760
Terrible.

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:47.288
Shameful.

01:37:04.050 --> 01:37:07.490
When you replay something
like this and you do it,

01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:09.896
it's very, very disturbing.

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:17.040
With these weapons at
the ready like this,

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:21.080
herding people like
cattle, it's just wrong.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.010
It feels wrong.

01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:24.010
To me, right now,
it feels wrong.

01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:58.372
Move on.

01:38:00.862 --> 01:38:01.858
Come on.

01:38:01.858 --> 01:38:02.854
Come on!

01:38:09.826 --> 01:38:10.822
Stand down.

01:38:25.264 --> 01:38:26.260
Last chance!

01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:28.359
Get back to work!

01:38:28.359 --> 01:38:30.355
It's your last chance.

01:38:30.355 --> 01:38:32.850
No!

01:38:32.850 --> 01:38:34.846
Last chance, y'all.

01:38:34.846 --> 01:38:36.842
Get on back to work.

01:38:53.808 --> 01:38:54.806
My sons!

01:38:54.806 --> 01:38:55.804
My sons!

01:38:55.804 --> 01:38:56.802
My sons!

01:38:56.802 --> 01:38:58.299
My sons!

01:39:06.283 --> 01:39:07.030
Back up.

01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.780
They're criminals.

01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:09.277
Back up.

01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:10.275
They're criminals.

01:39:10.275 --> 01:39:11.273
Back up.

01:39:11.273 --> 01:39:14.766
Solidarity forever.

01:39:14.766 --> 01:39:18.259
Solidarity forever.

01:39:18.259 --> 01:39:21.253
The union makes us strong.

01:39:21.253 --> 01:39:22.280
You're a criminal.

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.210
Now back up.

01:39:23.210 --> 01:39:25.106
You're the criminal.

01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:33.730
All of you, back up.

01:39:33.730 --> 01:39:34.600
Back in line.

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:36.010
Back up.

01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:38.729
Back up.

01:39:48.096 --> 01:39:51.054
We are the IWW.

01:39:51.054 --> 01:39:53.026
Get out of here.

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:56.500
People have rights.

01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:12.665
We're not breaking the law.

01:40:12.665 --> 01:40:16.964
I even voted for you, Sheriff.

01:40:18.401 --> 01:40:22.712
All of you have been arrested
for disturbance of the peace.

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.942
Don't you worry about it.

01:40:25.942 --> 01:40:28.894
Hey, quiet in the ranks.

01:40:34.798 --> 01:40:36.810
Come on, keep it rolling.

01:40:36.810 --> 01:40:39.484
Last chance to get back to work.

01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:46.250
On the car.

01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:46.870
On the car.

01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:47.650
On the car.

01:40:47.650 --> 01:40:48.320
On the car.

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:49.871
Get up there.

01:40:56.745 --> 01:40:57.992
Get your hands off.

01:40:57.992 --> 01:40:58.950
Get your hands off him.

01:40:58.950 --> 01:41:01.740
Get your hands off me!

01:41:02.701 --> 01:41:04.174
Let's go.

01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:09.452
he goes bollocks.

01:41:09.452 --> 01:41:10.446
Get back to work.

01:41:10.446 --> 01:41:11.937
This is wrong,
what you're doing.

01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:27.746
This is wrong.

01:41:27.746 --> 01:41:29.240
Let us go!

01:41:30.236 --> 01:41:31.232
This is wrong.

01:41:31.232 --> 01:41:33.224
You're a bunch of scabs!

01:41:33.224 --> 01:41:34.718
This is un-American.

01:41:39.698 --> 01:41:42.686
This is wrong what you're doing.

01:41:42.686 --> 01:41:46.172
This is wrong what you're doing.

01:41:46.172 --> 01:41:48.164
Bunch of scabs.

01:42:09.578 --> 01:42:11.072
We didn't do anything!

01:42:11.072 --> 01:42:13.841
You're all a bunch of scabs.

01:42:13.841 --> 01:42:16.700
The deportees are getting
loaded into boxcars,

01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:18.730
getting ready to
ship out of town.

01:42:18.730 --> 01:42:20.700
They won't break us.

01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:21.750
They won't break us.

01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:30.340
As a person in today's
world, yeah, it's

01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:33.740
really a question whether
it should be done or not.

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:36.240
Back in the time,
it was probably

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:40.070
different feelings on it,
but with today's values

01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:45.160
and today's ideals, it
shouldn't be happening.

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:48.490
In today's world, you know,
you don't-- this is not how you

01:42:48.490 --> 01:42:49.736
handle your issues.

01:42:49.736 --> 01:42:54.840
You don't just
vigilante-style justice

01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:57.520
and throw them into
boxcars and send them off.

01:42:58.650 --> 01:43:02.460
I've got to admit,
the side that I'm on right now.

01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:08.230
But that's using then
values and, you know,

01:43:08.230 --> 01:43:10.090
the world's changed
a lot since then.

01:43:10.090 --> 01:43:11.070
I got supper.

01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:14.500
Close the door.

01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:24.790
If we ever see you in Bisbee
again, we will kill you.

01:43:28.710 --> 01:43:34.150
They got what they needed
from the immigrants.

01:43:34.150 --> 01:43:36.700
They built what they
needed to build,

01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:38.568
and they said, we
don't need anymore,

01:43:38.568 --> 01:43:40.958
let's run them out of town.

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:47.370
This is where I
grew up, so I feel

01:43:47.370 --> 01:43:50.088
like I should be more involved.

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.960
I'm a person that
believes in destiny

01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:00.750
because I feel like our story
has been written for us,

01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:06.568
but it's just up to us
to participate or not.

01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:51.200
The mining company's plan to
crush the strike and unions

01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:53.310
had succeeded.

01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:55.950
Families were broken
up, women and children

01:44:55.950 --> 01:44:58.440
left without means of support.

01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:01.260
Friends and neighbors
became enemies.

01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:05.010
The events that led to July
12 and the actions on that day

01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:08.220
left permanent
and painful scars.

01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:09.910
Men died.

01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:11.770
Men disappeared.

01:45:11.770 --> 01:45:14.144
Life in Bisbee went on.

01:45:20.110 --> 01:45:22.780
But in our own time,
and in this mining town

01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:26.230
on the border with Mexico,
the word deportation

01:45:26.230 --> 01:45:29.620
is alive with meaning.

01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.950
It will not be forgotten.

01:45:37.110 --> 01:45:38.862
I don't know if I want
to touch your hand.

01:45:38.862 --> 01:45:40.320
I don't know if I
want to touch it.

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.122
Yeah, really.

01:45:44.636 --> 01:45:45.290
Thank you.

01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:47.123
And everything I said,
I don't mean anymore.

01:45:47.123 --> 01:45:48.235
Oh, yeah.

01:45:51.951 --> 01:45:55.016
This is like the largest
group therapy session.

01:45:55.016 --> 01:45:57.000
Yeah, it is.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.024
Everybody be nice and calm
when they go home for dinner.

01:46:00.024 --> 01:46:00.940
Maybe a little hoarse.

01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:02.600
Tired.

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.470
You guys are pretty good.

01:46:05.624 --> 01:46:07.240
Too damn good.

01:48:35.466 --> 01:48:39.830
We are waiting,
brother, waiting,

01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:44.710
though the night
be dark and long.

01:48:44.710 --> 01:48:53.252
And we know 'tis in
the making

01:48:53.252 --> 01:48:57.740
they have herded us
like cattle, torn us

01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:00.770
from our homes and wives.

01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:04.580
Yes, we've heard
their rifles rattle

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:09.870
and have feared for our lives.

01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:15.370
We have seen the workers
thousands march like bandits

01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:21.700
down the street, corporation
gunmen round them,

01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:26.600
and yes we've heard
their tramping feet.

01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:33.914
It was in the morning early
of the fateful July 12,

01:49:33.914 --> 01:49:43.170
and the year's 1917 this
took place of which I tell.

01:49:43.170 --> 01:49:50.245
Servants of the
with white bands on their arms

01:49:50.245 --> 01:49:54.040
drove and dragged
us out with curses,

01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:58.690
threats to kill on every hand.

01:49:58.690 --> 01:50:03.455
Question protest, all were
useless to those hounds

01:50:03.455 --> 01:50:05.730
who held that noose.

01:50:05.730 --> 01:50:13.406
Nothing but an armed resistance
would avail with these brutes.

01:50:13.406 --> 01:50:17.345
There they held us
long lines waiting

01:50:17.345 --> 01:50:21.210
'neath the blazing desert sun.

01:50:21.210 --> 01:50:26.598
Some with eyes bloodshot
and bleary wished for water,

01:50:26.598 --> 01:50:29.400
but had none.

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:34.165
Yes, some brave lives brought
us water, loving hearts

01:50:34.165 --> 01:50:40.775
and hands were theirs, but
the gunmen cursing often

01:50:40.775 --> 01:50:45.110
thwarted down upon the sands.

01:50:45.110 --> 01:50:50.480
Down the streets in squads
of 50 we were marched

01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:54.174
and some were
chained, down to where

01:50:54.174 --> 01:51:00.436
the shining rails stretched
across the sandy plains.

01:51:00.436 --> 01:51:04.830
When in haste with
kicks and curses

01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:09.720
we were herded into
cars, and it seemed

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:16.410
our lungs were bursting
with the odor of the yards.

01:51:16.410 --> 01:51:20.700
Floors were inches deep
with refuse left there

01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:23.242
from the herds.

01:51:23.242 --> 01:51:27.050
Good enough for
miners, damn them.

01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:31.200
May they soon be food for birds.

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.721
No farewells were
then allowed us,

01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:37.523
wives and babes
were left behind,

01:51:37.523 --> 01:51:44.180
though I saw their arms
around us as I closed my eyes

01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:46.130
and wept.

01:51:46.130 --> 01:51:49.450
After what seemed
like weeks of torture,

01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:57.470
we were at our journey's end,
left to starve upon the border

01:51:57.470 --> 01:52:02.769
almost on Caranza's
land, and they

01:52:02.769 --> 01:52:06.665
ran through law and
order, love of God

01:52:06.665 --> 01:52:14.166
and fellow man
freedom for the border being

01:52:14.166 --> 01:52:18.624
sent from promised
lands comes the day

01:52:18.624 --> 01:52:27.700
I will remember sure as death
relentless too grim

01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:34.350
their accusers, let them
call on God not you.
