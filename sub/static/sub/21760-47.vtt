Lucky:
Ugh, that's the last time
Rolly's digging up my stash.

01:18.040 --> 01:21.540
And I don't buy his story
about zombie-bone snatchers.

01:21.540 --> 01:25.500
Hmph!
Well, he'll never look here
on Cruella's land,

01:25.500 --> 01:27.750
and I'll bury this bone
so de--

01:30.580 --> 01:32.000
Ouch.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
That's pretty deep.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.500
Hmm, I may have over dug.

01:36.500 --> 01:39.580
This place is way cool,

01:39.580 --> 01:42.000
freezing actually.

01:44.710 --> 01:46.620
Whoa-- whoa doggie!

01:46.620 --> 01:48.790
Whoa!

01:51.290 --> 01:53.210
Holy chimichanga!

01:54.210 --> 01:57.080
That's one fierce
looking pup-sicle.

01:58.210 --> 02:00.790
So while my public
stands naked

02:00.790 --> 02:02.750
waiting for my next
fashion inspiration,

02:02.750 --> 02:07.210
here I am
with a catastrophic case
of designer's block.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.580
P.H., you must help me.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.830
Perhaps you can
invent a new fabric or...

02:14.040 --> 02:17.210
What could possibly
be more interesting than me?

02:17.210 --> 02:19.080
A spider.

02:19.080 --> 02:21.170
I'm genetically
cross-breeding them

02:21.170 --> 02:22.830
with insurance salesmen,

02:22.830 --> 02:26.120
so I can crush them
like bugs.

02:26.120 --> 02:28.210
Well, I desperately
need something

02:28.210 --> 02:29.790
to remind the fashion world

02:29.790 --> 02:32.080
that I haven't dropped off
the face of the earth!

02:35.920 --> 02:37.120
Fascinating.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.960
A prehistoric era ice cavern.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.540
I don't care
if it's a bat cave.

02:42.540 --> 02:44.080
Let's get out of here!

02:50.830 --> 02:53.960
Get off of me,
you Bunsen boob!

02:55.000 --> 02:58.080
This is incredible.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.920
What is that hideous thing?

03:00.920 --> 03:03.170
That hideous thing

03:03.170 --> 03:05.330
appears to be
a perfectly preserved

03:05.330 --> 03:07.210
prehistoric cave pup,

03:07.210 --> 03:10.120
possibly over 10,000 years old.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.790
Cruella: Marvelous!

03:11.790 --> 03:14.000
This is exactly
what I've been looking for.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I'll call it
"Caninus Cruellus."

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
The publicity will launch
a whole new clothing line:

03:20.000 --> 03:23.500
"Prehistoric Apparel
by Cruella."

03:23.500 --> 03:26.250
Come!
I have designers
to browbeat.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.170
And I'll get my instruments

03:28.170 --> 03:30.290
so I can start dissecting.

03:30.290 --> 03:33.000
Yuck!
I got to get out of here

03:33.000 --> 03:35.460
before that doggy dicer
gets back.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.250
W-w-w-whoa!

03:39.250 --> 03:40.750
Ooh!

03:52.170 --> 03:53.710
Ah, it's alive,

03:53.710 --> 03:56.120
and seriously ticked off.

03:59.210 --> 04:01.960
Uh, did you hear that?

04:01.960 --> 04:04.330
No, I just thought
it would be fun

04:04.330 --> 04:06.920
to fly into a tree
at Mach 5!

04:06.920 --> 04:11.210
This is no time for witty
speed-related sarcasm.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.120
I thought I heard
Lucky down there.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.420
Lucky? Lucky!

04:20.880 --> 04:23.000
Who's your new friend?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Uh-h, it's a cave pup,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.170
fresh frozen
about 10,000 years ago.

04:31.420 --> 04:33.170
Ooh, yum.

04:34.750 --> 04:38.380
Uh, 10,000 years
without food, I take it?

04:40.290 --> 04:42.920
Cave Pup: Cluck!

04:42.920 --> 04:45.920
Somebody want to get him
a sandwich now?!

04:49.920 --> 04:52.120
Dinner, friend.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.330
Yum, yuck!

04:54.330 --> 04:55.880
Thanks a lot.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.750
Dinner?

04:57.750 --> 04:59.580
Yum.

04:59.580 --> 05:02.250
Friend, yuck.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.790
Me, Lucky.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.830
You, Cave Pup.

05:12.830 --> 05:14.920
Hmm, CP for short.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.460
Hmm, me CP.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.120
Way to g--

05:23.460 --> 05:25.210
Fun guy, isn't he?

05:25.210 --> 05:26.750
That's it!

05:26.750 --> 05:30.420
I say we leave Jurassic pup
right where we found him.

05:30.420 --> 05:34.960
Uh, we can't.
P.H. De Vil is coming back
to dissect him.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.830
Come on, CP.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.290
He doesn't understand.

05:39.290 --> 05:42.120
We must somehow reach back
through the eons

05:42.120 --> 05:44.880
and connect
with the primal pup.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.330
Chow time.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.380
Uh, chow time.

05:51.380 --> 05:53.040
Yeah...

05:53.040 --> 05:56.080
the language of food
knows no boundaries.

06:00.460 --> 06:04.380
The only chance this
poor misplaced cave canine

06:04.380 --> 06:07.170
has for survival
is to blend in.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.920
-No, CP!
-Stop.

06:29.830 --> 06:31.830
Oh, yeah, he blends right in.

06:33.290 --> 06:35.750
Lucky:
Use plenty of
soap and water.

06:35.750 --> 06:39.120
He's got thousands of years
of crud on him.

06:41.670 --> 06:44.960
Hey!
Watch it!

07:16.330 --> 07:19.000
Well, that was
time well-spent.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.880
Cruella:
Where is that
fossilized fur

07:22.880 --> 07:25.880
Oh, I told the press
we'd be unveiling

07:25.880 --> 07:28.750
the prehistoric pooch
in one hour at the museum.

07:28.750 --> 07:33.170
Interesting-- paw prints,
one set with two toes--

07:33.170 --> 07:35.170
My word!

07:35.170 --> 07:37.460
It's alive!

07:37.460 --> 07:39.420
-Curious.

07:39.420 --> 07:42.830
There's also three sets
of normal puppy prints,

07:42.830 --> 07:45.210
and a chicken?

07:45.210 --> 07:47.420
The Dearly mutts.

07:47.420 --> 07:49.880
-Now to bag the beast.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.040
Fortunately,
I know just the Neanderthals
to do the job.

08:02.670 --> 08:04.620
Okay, now, see,

08:04.620 --> 08:07.880
this is the proper way
to eat kibble.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.880
-Mine.
-Hey, cut that out.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.500
And stop wrecking our home,
you prehistoric pinhead.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.460
Uh?
Not friends?

08:32.460 --> 08:35.000
Horace and Jasper!
Cruella must have sent 'em!

08:35.000 --> 08:36.830
We got to get
CP out of here!

08:38.170 --> 08:40.830
Hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

08:40.830 --> 08:43.170
Not friends.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.750
Finding this cave pooch
could take hours.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.710
Yeah, it could-- Hmm.

08:50.710 --> 08:52.250
Must be daylight savings time.

08:52.250 --> 08:53.790
Now all we got to do
is deliver him

08:53.790 --> 08:55.580
to Cruella's museum.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.290
Nice going,
Mr. Congeniality.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.960
I know I blew it
big time,

09:01.960 --> 09:04.000
but we'll rescue him
at the museum.

09:05.790 --> 09:08.380
And so the world
waits breathlessly

09:08.380 --> 09:11.170
for the unveiling
of the first cave dog.

09:11.170 --> 09:12.710
Yes, yes, yes,
we'll get to that,

09:12.710 --> 09:16.880
but the real new sensation
is my new Prehistoric Apparel

09:16.880 --> 09:17.880
by Cruella.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.000
We got to hurry.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.750
Cruella:
And wearing my latest

09:24.750 --> 09:28.500
fashion triumph
is my gullible cousin P.H.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.710
Aww, come on, CP.

09:30.710 --> 09:34.210
-Nuh-uh, not friends.
-Yes friends.

09:34.210 --> 09:36.500
Look, I was
the prehistoric pinhead.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.290
I'm really sorry, okay?

09:38.290 --> 09:40.750
-Just kiss and make up fast!

09:40.750 --> 09:44.290
And now the house of De Vil
proudly presents

09:44.290 --> 09:47.040
Caninus Cruellus!

09:47.040 --> 09:48.960
Let's blow this bone stand.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.290
Ah, my publicity stunt
is escaping.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.380
-After him!

09:54.380 --> 09:55.620
Come back here!

09:55.620 --> 09:57.540
-Come on back,
you bozo!

10:00.380 --> 10:01.710
Huh?

10:03.790 --> 10:06.540
Jasper:
Come back here!
Come on back here!

10:06.540 --> 10:08.210
Whoa!

10:09.750 --> 10:10.920
Got ya!

10:12.670 --> 10:15.880
Great, tarred and--
already feathered.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.580
I'll get you
and your little chicken too!

10:26.380 --> 10:28.000
-Strike!

10:36.000 --> 10:37.670
Ah, thanks, buddy.

10:37.670 --> 10:40.830
Oh, how I hate
these puppies,

10:40.830 --> 10:44.210
past, present, and future!

10:46.790 --> 10:48.250
Somehow we got
to get CP

10:48.250 --> 10:50.710
as far away
from Cruella
as possible.

10:50.710 --> 10:53.960
Hey, getting the tar off
was brutal.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.580
Anyway, the barking chain
has found some of CP's cousins,

10:57.580 --> 10:59.580
a million times removed.

10:59.580 --> 11:00.710
They're happy
to take him in.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.210
I'll sure miss you, CP.

11:05.210 --> 11:06.960
So true.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.670
Our friendship
spans the millennia--

11:09.670 --> 11:12.750
paws reaching across
the sands of time

11:12.750 --> 11:14.880
forming a primal bond.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.170
Whatever.

11:17.620 --> 11:20.670
Lucky teach CP friendship.

11:20.670 --> 11:23.250
Uh, it works both ways.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.750
-Friend!

11:29.330 --> 11:31.040
I'll be back.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.540
In another 10,000 years
would be good.

12:07.580 --> 12:11.000
Good work, Mooch.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.620
Thanks.

12:12.620 --> 12:15.000
Vendella:
They call that
a defending champ?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.670
Perhaps they meant chimp.

12:20.460 --> 12:22.170
Don't let 'em
get to you, Mooch.

12:22.170 --> 12:24.000
Save it for
the wrestling match.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.040
Yeah, they're just jealous

12:26.040 --> 12:29.620
because you're gonna cream
their chump-changed challenger

12:29.620 --> 12:32.830
-El Dweebo.
-That's El Diablo.

12:32.830 --> 12:35.040
Oh, yes, here we go again.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.080
That barbaric annual
wrestling match

12:38.080 --> 12:40.460
that brings even
sworn enemies

12:40.460 --> 12:42.040
like Lucky and Mooch together.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.080
I'd like to propose
an alternative:

12:45.080 --> 12:46.830
a spelling bee!

12:46.830 --> 12:49.580
Just think of it.
An intellectual challenge

12:49.580 --> 12:51.920
instead of a half-witted
physical one.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.620
But that's the kind
I'm good at.

12:53.620 --> 12:56.500
Were good at.
A week from today,

12:56.500 --> 12:59.250
El Diablo will turn you
into pretzel pup.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.620
-Sweet dreams.
!

13:02.620 --> 13:05.330
Ooh, nice comeback, Mooch,

13:05.330 --> 13:07.960
concise, pithy,
yet moronic.

13:07.960 --> 13:11.620
It's all so terribly sad,

13:11.620 --> 13:15.580
still settling our differences
through brute force.

13:15.580 --> 13:18.540
-Cadpig: Our honor comes from
being intelligent canines...

13:18.540 --> 13:20.790
-and rising above violence.

13:20.790 --> 13:22.670
He he he he he!

13:22.670 --> 13:25.460
You're dead meat!

13:26.670 --> 13:29.330
Nobody lays a paw
on my brother, understand?!

13:29.330 --> 13:31.580
-Nobody!
-I-- I--

13:31.580 --> 13:34.380
Oh, you may think
you're a big wrestling champ,

13:34.380 --> 13:37.120
but you're nothing
but a boorish, rude,

13:37.120 --> 13:38.620
gutless bully!

13:38.620 --> 13:42.460
What a woman!

13:42.460 --> 13:44.920
Hey, has anybody seen Mooch?

13:44.920 --> 13:46.500
He's got to train
for the match.

13:52.960 --> 13:57.250
Lose something,
like, say, a wrestler?

13:57.250 --> 13:59.620
Or maybe he's too chicken.

13:59.620 --> 14:03.830
That does it!
Now she's badmouthing
my people!

14:03.830 --> 14:06.380
I'll fight
El Ding-dongo myself!

14:06.380 --> 14:08.250
Let me at her!

14:08.250 --> 14:10.040
That's El Diablo.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.120
Don't worry.
Mooch'll be there.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.250
We know exactly
where he is.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.210
And when we find him,

14:16.210 --> 14:18.080
we'll let you know.

14:18.080 --> 14:21.420
Yeah, well, wherever he is,

14:21.420 --> 14:23.000
I hope he's practicing.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.620
El Diablo trains
16 hours a day,

14:25.620 --> 14:29.000
then wrestles alligators
in his sleep.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.830
You're busted, mister!

14:41.830 --> 14:44.000
I'm giving you 30 seconds
to explain

14:44.000 --> 14:45.880
why you've been
following me or--

14:45.880 --> 14:47.920
-For you.

14:47.920 --> 14:51.000
A smelly, old boot?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
For me?

14:57.040 --> 14:59.170
You're in love
with Mooch?!

14:59.170 --> 15:01.120
But you said
he was boorish.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.580
-He's rugged.
-You said he was crude.

15:03.580 --> 15:07.000
-He's direct.
-You said he was thoughtless.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.290
He's utterly without facade,

15:09.290 --> 15:11.880
just a diamond
in the rough.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.710
Ohh.

15:35.170 --> 15:38.540
Cadpig:
He loves me,
he loves me not.

15:38.540 --> 15:42.000
Oh, it's enough
to make you lose
your appetite.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.960
Well, not you.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.750
He loves you,
and he'd do anything for you.

15:49.460 --> 15:53.620
No need,
things are perfect
just the way they are.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.120
Of course you're perfect

15:56.120 --> 15:58.290
just the way you are,
Moochie Woochie.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.330
-Rinsing!

16:00.330 --> 16:02.750
I see you with
more of a wet look.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.380
Cadpig: Very masculine!

16:07.380 --> 16:10.710
So earthy,
yet uncontrived.

16:10.710 --> 16:14.380
Now, the bean bag's
got to go!

16:14.380 --> 16:16.330
These milk crates
need to be re-colorized,

16:16.330 --> 16:19.830
and I'm sure we can find
some kitschy storage containers

16:19.830 --> 16:21.750
for your kibble.

16:21.750 --> 16:24.580
Um, this isn't
exactly what-- what I--

16:24.580 --> 16:26.040
Don't you like it?

16:26.040 --> 16:31.210
Of course I do.
You know I'd do
anything for you.

16:31.210 --> 16:33.420
Well, Moochie Woochie,

16:33.420 --> 16:35.790
if you really cared about me

16:35.790 --> 16:38.380
you'd rise above
your brutish urges

16:38.380 --> 16:40.250
to fight El Diablo.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.710
-You'd embrace...
-Embrace a more rational,

16:42.710 --> 16:45.920
more loving view
of interpersonal contact.

16:45.920 --> 16:49.170
Do you know what
you are doing right now?

16:49.170 --> 16:51.830
You are growing.

16:51.830 --> 16:53.330
Uh.

16:53.330 --> 16:55.830
What do you mean
you won't wrestle?

16:57.210 --> 17:00.210
Moochie no longer accepts
brute physical force

17:00.210 --> 17:02.250
as a means
of conflict resolution.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.580
Right, Poochums?

17:04.580 --> 17:07.170
Right, Cadpoopsie whoopsie.

17:07.170 --> 17:09.620
Come on,
let's go read
some poetry.

17:09.620 --> 17:12.170
Oh, man.
She did it.

17:12.170 --> 17:14.790
She turned him
into a total wimp.

17:14.790 --> 17:16.710
We're sunk.

17:16.710 --> 17:18.460
Mooch is the defending champ.

17:18.460 --> 17:21.080
Only he can go up
against El Diablo.

17:21.080 --> 17:24.380
The fair honor of Dearly Farm
will be besmirched.

17:24.380 --> 17:26.210
Yeah, and Vendella
and Scorch

17:26.210 --> 17:27.710
will think we're dweebs.

17:27.710 --> 17:29.460
We got to get
through to Mooch.

17:29.460 --> 17:33.380
Forget it.
You can't fight
a romance like that.

17:33.380 --> 17:36.540
Then if we can't fight it,
let's make it work for us.

17:36.540 --> 17:38.460
We're gonna train him
for that match,

17:38.460 --> 17:40.960
whether he knows it or not.

17:50.080 --> 17:54.000
This is just so sensitive
of you, Rolly,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.670
to make a romantic
dinner for us.

17:56.670 --> 17:59.880
More pasta, Mooch?
Go on, load up.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.080
Nothing like
complex carbohydrates
before a big--

18:03.080 --> 18:07.290
-Uh, er, nothing--

18:07.290 --> 18:08.790
with dessert!

18:12.000 --> 18:14.420
Don't worry.

18:14.420 --> 18:19.420
A little Parmesan
and I'll be just fine.

18:21.330 --> 18:25.540
Ooh, I see true love
and sweet romance!

18:25.540 --> 18:27.210
And as we know,

18:27.210 --> 18:29.960
the basis of any
committed relationship

18:29.960 --> 18:31.460
is mutual support

18:31.460 --> 18:34.670
as we undertake
life's challenges.

18:34.670 --> 18:36.540
What challenges?!

18:36.540 --> 18:41.040
Oh, uh, you know,
fear, loss,

18:41.040 --> 18:43.620
-wrestling matches!

18:50.620 --> 18:53.330
Step right up
and win a prize
for your sweetheart.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.420
-This is heavy.

18:57.420 --> 19:00.290
That's okay,
just keep lifting.

19:00.290 --> 19:01.620
Ten repetitions or so

19:01.620 --> 19:03.830
will really build
your upper-body strength.

19:10.380 --> 19:12.880
So who's gonna
tell El Diablo

19:12.880 --> 19:14.580
Mooch doesn't
want to wrestle?

19:14.580 --> 19:17.170
-I'll tell him.
-No, really, that's okay.

19:17.170 --> 19:19.880
We don't want El Diablo
to see you like this now,

19:25.250 --> 19:27.670
Lucky:
Okay, so where is he?

19:27.670 --> 19:30.330
I am down here.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.330
Both:
That's El Diablo?

19:36.080 --> 19:40.040
So you are, how they say,
Moochie Coochie, no?

19:40.040 --> 19:42.670
Get ready to rumba, chico!

19:42.670 --> 19:45.120
I will not wrestle you,
El Diablo.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.710
I've come to realize
that honor and respect
come from within,

19:48.710 --> 19:50.960
not from hostile competition
with others.

19:50.960 --> 19:54.040
Dearly Farm forfeits.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.750
Forfeit shmorfeit,

19:55.750 --> 19:57.880
I don't need
no sticking rule book.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.080
Who is dog enough
to wrestle me?

20:00.080 --> 20:02.000
I will wrestle
El Ding Bat.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.830
-That is Diablo!

20:04.830 --> 20:07.620
-Spot: The Luck-meister
is in fine form today.

20:07.620 --> 20:10.500
He's gone straight
for the toe twist.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.000
Diablo's not
having any of it.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.120
Lucky goes into
the "spinning fur ball,"
but to no avail.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.420
Diablo's giving
him the slip.

20:17.420 --> 20:21.540
What? He's attempting
the infamous hair-raising move,

20:21.540 --> 20:23.620
-but hold on.
Diablo makes his move.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.080
Looks like El Diablo
has found a new opponent.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.960
And defeated him.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.960
Who will be next?

20:43.710 --> 20:46.460
Someone's got to
reason with him, Cadsie-pie.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.880
Listen, Mr. Diablo.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.380
May I call you "El"?

20:54.380 --> 20:56.250
You're just acting out,

20:56.250 --> 20:59.790
perhaps overcompensating
for your diminutive size.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.710
-How insightful.

21:05.620 --> 21:07.620
Ooh! That does it!

21:07.620 --> 21:11.580
You are mine,
El Diaper Rash!

21:13.460 --> 21:15.670
Whoa!

21:22.880 --> 21:27.460
Holy guacamole,
what a woman.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.670
Though I wish you'd found

21:33.670 --> 21:36.210
a less violent means
of conflict resolution,

21:36.210 --> 21:38.920
you did save Dearly Farm.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.710
Shall we celebrate
with some herbal tea?

21:42.960 --> 21:45.920
Let's have a little
heart

21:47.580 --> 21:49.670
Sorry, Mooch,
but it's over.

21:49.670 --> 21:52.080
My work with you is done.
You're healed,

21:52.080 --> 21:55.040
and frankly
you're no longer a challenge.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.920
-Bye-bye.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.380
You know, Elly,

21:59.380 --> 22:01.750
that Napoleon complex
is kinda cute,

22:01.750 --> 22:04.620
but there's always
room to grow.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.120
Have you ever considered...

22:06.120 --> 22:08.620
elevator shoes?
