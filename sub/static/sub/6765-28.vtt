WEBVTT

00:09.844 --> 00:12.278
Will you hand me
the water bottle?

00:12.313 --> 00:14.372
Hot enough for you?

00:14.415 --> 00:15.473
Never hot enough for me.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.143
Hmm. Well, you better not stay

00:17.185 --> 00:18.209
out here very long.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.015
The ultraviolet index
hit six today.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.249
Good, that means
l'll get a tan faster.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.554
No, that means your skin
will fall off faster.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.820
Ever heard of melanoma?

00:25.860 --> 00:27.122
You are such a downer.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.254
Finally get a chance
to build a tan

00:29.297 --> 00:31.697
and all you can think about
is the ozone layer?

00:38.373 --> 00:40.170
This isn't cutting it.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.176
l'm gonna go take a dip.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.871
You coming?

00:43.911 --> 00:45.845
Are you kidding?
The ocean's freezing.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.575
Come on! lt's the first swim
of the season.

00:47.649 --> 00:49.207
l can't.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.376
What do you still need
that bandage for?

00:50.418 --> 00:52.079
Hasn't your arm healed yet?

00:52.120 --> 00:54.782
Donna, l don't want
to go for a swim.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.380
Fine.

00:57.659 --> 00:59.320
l'll get it.

01:07.969 --> 01:09.027
Afternoon.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.537
l have a package
for Kelly Taylor.

01:10.605 --> 01:11.867
That's me.

01:11.906 --> 01:14.272
l just need your
Jane Hancock right here

01:14.308 --> 01:15.866
and it's all yours.

01:18.112 --> 01:21.013
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

01:21.049 --> 01:22.107
You're welcome.

01:24.519 --> 01:27.249
Who sent that?

01:27.288 --> 01:29.984
Seventeen magazine?!

01:30.024 --> 01:31.753
Well, what are you waiting for?

01:31.793 --> 01:32.760
Open it up.

01:32.794 --> 01:33.886
l will.
l'm just so surprised.

01:33.928 --> 01:34.986
l haven't heard from them
in months.

01:35.029 --> 01:37.327
Well, now you're hearing
from them.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.957
Open it before l do.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.044 --> 01:52.069
Look, you're famous!

01:52.113 --> 01:54.411
That's you.

04:11.285 --> 04:14.482
l have missed my boy.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.512
Well, the boy's back.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.649
And what made you come
to your senses?

04:18.692 --> 04:20.320
House call in Reno.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.761
l knew Donna would convince you
to come home.

04:22.797 --> 04:24.731
lt wasn't Donna.

04:28.236 --> 04:30.204
Well, if it wasn't
Donna, who was it?

04:32.707 --> 04:35.039
Are you telling me
that Valerie Malone

04:35.076 --> 04:37.544
hauled her cookies
all the way up to Reno

04:37.612 --> 04:38.943
just to see you?

04:38.980 --> 04:41.005
lt was a business trip, Mom.
That's it.

04:41.048 --> 04:44.108
l'm starting at the Peach Pit
After Dark again tomorrow night.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.381
Sweetheart, l don't mean
to give you a hard time.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.047
l'm just glad you're home.

04:48.089 --> 04:50.080
Mom, me, too.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.456
Maybe, one of these days,

04:52.493 --> 04:55.553
you might even invite me down
to see one of your shows.

04:55.630 --> 04:58.064
Well, what're you doing
tomorrow night?

04:58.099 --> 05:00.567
l thought you'd never ask.

05:00.635 --> 05:02.500
You know why l haven't asked.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.162
l'll be on my best behavior.

05:04.205 --> 05:05.194
l promise.

05:06.474 --> 05:07.941
lt's gotta be Donna.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.035
Listen, Mom,

05:11.078 --> 05:14.047
Donna doesn't know that Valerie
came up to Reno.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.946
Ray...

05:15.983 --> 05:17.416
And l want to keep it that way.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.453
Hi.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.429
-Welcome back!
-Thanks, babe.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.532
lt feels like you've been gone
an eternity.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.194
Well, eternity's over.

05:35.236 --> 05:36.703
Hi, honey.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.797
l sure missed seeing
your face around here.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.330
Hi, Lu Ann.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.678
Well, l'll just go
make myself scarce.

05:47.048 --> 05:49.516
So, how are you?

05:49.550 --> 05:50.744
How am l?

05:50.785 --> 05:51.979
Well, l'm stir crazy.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.850
l've been sitting on my can
in that truck

05:53.888 --> 05:55.378
driving for
the last eight hours.

05:55.423 --> 05:58.756
So l guess you don't want
to go inside and sit down, huh?

05:58.793 --> 06:02.024
No. l want to take you
and lie down.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.096
Look, guys, l really appreciate

06:10.137 --> 06:11.468
this sendoff and everything,

06:11.505 --> 06:14.030
but l'm only gonna be
in Sacramento for two days.

06:14.075 --> 06:15.872
What's the conference about?

06:15.910 --> 06:17.707
lt's just a bunch of student
body presidents

06:17.745 --> 06:19.178
from all over the state
getting together

06:19.213 --> 06:20.646
to talk about issues
and meet legislators.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.046
Yeah, but l don't understand

06:22.083 --> 06:23.983
why it's not
in some vacation area

06:24.018 --> 06:26.111
like Santa Barbara
or Carmel or La Jolla.

06:26.153 --> 06:29.145
Steve, it has
to be in Sacramento.

06:29.190 --> 06:30.350
Why?

06:32.727 --> 06:34.752
Sacramento's the capitol
of California.

06:37.999 --> 06:39.364
l'm sorry l'm late,

06:39.400 --> 06:43.063
but look what they're selling
at the grocery store!

06:43.104 --> 06:44.537
-Wow! Let me see that!
-l was standing

06:44.572 --> 06:46.733
in line and there it was,
right in the magazine rack.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.935
Oh, you should have seen
the cashier's face

06:48.976 --> 06:51.240
when l told her that
you were my son's girlfriend.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.540
You should give Jackie a call.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.445
l'm sure she'd love
to hear all about it.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.972
Aw, come on, tell me
you're not enjoying

06:56.017 --> 06:56.984
your 15 minutes of fame.

06:57.018 --> 06:59.680
What?

06:59.720 --> 07:01.745
Hey, you can downplay it
all you want, young lady,

07:01.789 --> 07:03.450
but from what
your mother's been telling me,

07:03.491 --> 07:05.823
her phone's been ringing off the
hook with agents and magazines

07:05.860 --> 07:07.225
all calling about you.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.489
Yeah, well, too late.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.494
What do you mean?

07:09.563 --> 07:10.495
Mom, shh, don't.

07:10.598 --> 07:11.963
No, it's okay.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.467
They don't know
about the scars yet.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.696
Jackie's been dodging
the phone calls,

07:15.736 --> 07:16.896
telling everyone

07:16.937 --> 07:18.700
that l'm too busy in school
right now.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.639
Talk about denial.

07:20.674 --> 07:24.110
But who'd want a model with
scars all over her neck anyway?

07:24.145 --> 07:25.271
Ah, come on Kelly,

07:25.312 --> 07:27.109
they can cover that
with a little makeup.

07:27.148 --> 07:30.242
Really? ls that what they could
do, Steve? l had no idea.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.309
ln that case,
why don't we just call

07:32.353 --> 07:34.480
Calvin Klein right now,
and tell him l'm available

07:34.522 --> 07:36.854
for the next 15 minutes.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.621
ls she okay?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.821
Ever since that cover came out,

07:41.862 --> 07:43.159
she's been a little off-kilter.

07:43.197 --> 07:46.428
But why? l mean,
it's absolutely beautiful.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.095
Yeah, it is, but in her mind,

07:49.136 --> 07:50.728
she's never gonna look
like that again.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.171
God, l hate this.

07:53.207 --> 07:54.435
Steve,
you didn't start the fire.

07:54.475 --> 07:55.533
Yeah, but l...

07:55.643 --> 07:57.804
just wish there was something
l could do.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.117
You know, l've been
sitting in there

08:11.158 --> 08:12.955
having dirty thoughts
about you all night.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.360
About me or the girl
in the magazine?

08:16.397 --> 08:17.796
Lucky for me, both.

08:17.832 --> 08:20.027
l want you to know
that my obsession with you

08:20.067 --> 08:22.365
will last much longer
than 15 minutes.

08:22.403 --> 08:25.930
How long?

08:25.973 --> 08:29.932
Mm, 16... 1 7.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.006
Oh, what the hell?

08:33.047 --> 08:36.015
l could probably
stretch it to 20.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.917
Look, would you put
this damn thing down?

08:47.962 --> 08:49.452
l thought we were gonna try

08:49.497 --> 08:50.964
to get some work done
here today.

08:50.998 --> 08:54.331
l just can't get over it-- Kelly
Taylor on a magazine cover.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.201
Well, look, she is a fox.

08:57.238 --> 08:59.035
l wouldn't kick her out of my
bed.

08:59.073 --> 09:01.837
Yeah, you wouldn't kick anybody
out of your bed.

09:01.876 --> 09:03.468
Hey, guys.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.476
What's up?

09:04.545 --> 09:05.773
Hey. Uh, well,

09:05.813 --> 09:07.075
well, we're just
sitting here trying

09:07.114 --> 09:09.241
to get some work done
on the script, if your boy

09:09.283 --> 09:10.841
could get his head
back in the picture.

09:10.885 --> 09:12.409
Well, if l'm quiet,
can l stay?

09:12.453 --> 09:13.579
No.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.111
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Have a seat.

09:15.156 --> 09:16.180
Thanks.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.750
So, what do you think
of the second act?

09:19.793 --> 09:21.488
Okay, first things first.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.257
Exactly when did this movie
go from being a thriller

09:24.298 --> 09:26.323
about reincarnation
to a porno flick?

09:26.367 --> 09:28.460
lt's not porno.

09:28.502 --> 09:32.438
lt's just one little
menage a trois scene.

09:32.473 --> 09:33.440
Menage a trois?

09:33.474 --> 09:35.499
Wait, you guys
are doing a threesome?

09:35.576 --> 09:36.565
Stop drooling.

09:38.479 --> 09:40.913
lt's an homage to Jules and Jim.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.347
Who are Jules and Jim?

09:42.383 --> 09:45.284
Not who, what.

09:45.319 --> 09:47.685
lt's a classic film
by Francois Truffaut.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.779
Yeah, l know.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.187
l did a paper on that film.

09:50.224 --> 09:52.249
lt practically started
the French New Wave.

09:52.293 --> 09:53.521
Get out of here.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.993
No, l swear, at SUNY Buffalo.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.157
And it's not about
a menage a trois.

09:58.199 --> 10:00.099
lt's about a woman
who's in love

10:00.134 --> 10:01.192
with two men equally--

10:01.235 --> 10:04.295
one spiritually
and one physically.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.704
Maybe l oughta check it out.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.537
l got an idea.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.940
Why don't the three of us
get together

10:10.978 --> 10:12.309
and watch it?

10:13.614 --> 10:15.241
Start our own little New Wave.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.514
Hey, D, uh,

10:18.552 --> 10:21.521
can l have this magazine back?
l want to show Willie.

10:21.555 --> 10:23.113
Yeah, sure, Nat.

10:23.157 --> 10:25.751
Boy, Kelly really hit it
big-time, huh?

10:25.793 --> 10:27.420
Got a celebrity in our midst.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.731
They can work miracles
with an airbrush.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.982
Thanks.

11:01.295 --> 11:02.819
We've been so busy
talking music,

11:02.863 --> 11:05.798
l haven't had a chance to ask
you how your mom's doing?

11:05.833 --> 11:06.959
She's doing better.

11:07.001 --> 11:08.901
Thanks for asking.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.494
You know,
l think David and Ray

11:10.537 --> 11:12.505
are actually having
a conversation.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.531
Well, Portland had
a big effect on all of us.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.406
Maybe we should
double-date this weekend.

11:17.444 --> 11:18.536
Eh, don't press your luck.

11:18.612 --> 11:20.443
You know, Ray and l
were just thinking,

11:20.481 --> 11:22.847
uh, it'd be kind of cool
if we all, like,

11:22.883 --> 11:24.407
went on a double-date--
you know,

11:24.451 --> 11:26.442
maybe to a concert
or something?

11:26.487 --> 11:28.455
What's so funny?

11:28.489 --> 11:30.013
Oh, nothing, nothing at all.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.494
Well, Truffaut ended
Jules and Jim

11:35.529 --> 11:38.020
by having Catherine drive
her car into the river.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.965
Well, then, Truffaut had
more money than we do.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.399
Because this is
a low-budget movie.

11:41.435 --> 11:42.902
We can't afford
a stunt like that.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.461
Well, if you feel that way,
then maybe we should cut out

11:45.506 --> 11:46.973
the paragliding sequence
that you wrote.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.531
lt's impossible.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.203
That's sequentially essential.

11:51.245 --> 11:54.942
Oh! Sorry, guys, my star
attraction just arrived.

11:54.982 --> 11:55.971
Hey, guys.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.005
-Hi, Val.
-Hey.

11:57.051 --> 11:58.416
l was wondering when
you were going

11:58.452 --> 11:59.578
to show your face around here.

11:59.620 --> 12:02.020
Present and accounted for.

12:02.056 --> 12:03.523
Listen, Valerie, l just
wanted to thank you again

12:03.557 --> 12:04.785
for convincing Ray
to come back here.

12:04.825 --> 12:05.985
No problem.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.857
l'm just as glad to have him
back as you are.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.230
Hello.

12:15.269 --> 12:17.999
-Hi, is this Kelly Taylor?
-Yes, it is.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.802
This is Bill Shepherd.
l saw Seventeen.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.433
You have a great look
for us, babe.

12:22.476 --> 12:23.465
Look-Look, Mr. Shepherd, uh,

12:23.510 --> 12:25.444
-Yes.
-l appreciate the compliment,

12:25.479 --> 12:27.640
but me being on
the cover of that magazine

12:27.681 --> 12:29.308
was a one-shot deal.

12:29.350 --> 12:30.408
Oh, l see.
Well, maybe, you know,

12:30.451 --> 12:31.509
-if you change your mind,
-Yeah.

12:31.552 --> 12:32.644
you could
give me a call later, okay?

12:32.686 --> 12:33.846
Okay, take care.

12:33.887 --> 12:34.979
Okay.

12:40.694 --> 12:43.561
You've reached 555-5215.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.825
Please leave your message
at the sound of the beep.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.495
Hello, Mother, it's me.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.765
Hi, l hope, for your sake,
you didn't give my number

12:50.804 --> 12:53.272
to a Bill Shepherd
from the Mayer Agency,

12:53.307 --> 12:54.501
because he just called me up.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.907
Bye.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.378
So, are they breaking down the
door of our favorite cover girl?

12:59.413 --> 13:01.381
Something like that.

13:01.415 --> 13:03.212
Kel, you want something?
Fries, burger?

13:03.250 --> 13:06.117
No. l already ate.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.670
l'm glad l'm not going
through this alone.

13:24.705 --> 13:25.672
We're gonna die in here.

13:25.706 --> 13:27.571
No we're not. Don't say that.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.250
Kel, are you okay?

13:48.295 --> 13:51.662
Yeah, l, um...
l dropped something.

13:51.698 --> 13:52.824
Sorry.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.443
Okay, open up the hanger,
'cause here it comes...

14:05.479 --> 14:08.277
Ah... zzz... boom.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.045
Good, hmm?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.312
Hey, Andrea?

14:12.352 --> 14:15.082
Yep, got it, got it, got it.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.420
Hello.

14:17.458 --> 14:18.516
One moment.

14:18.559 --> 14:20.049
-Jesse...
-Take a message.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.618
l've got some quality time going
with my little princess here.

14:22.663 --> 14:24.096
lt's Judge Jimenez.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.031
You mean an assistant
to Judge Jimenez.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.761
No, Judge Jimenez himself.

14:27.801 --> 14:30.133
Hold that thought.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.406
Hello, Your Honor.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.309
Very well, thanks.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.176
Yeah?

14:40.214 --> 14:41.545
Yeah...?

14:41.648 --> 14:44.742
Really?

14:44.785 --> 14:48.380
Uh, l'm incredibly flattered.

14:48.422 --> 14:50.185
l'm overwhelmed, in fact.

14:50.224 --> 14:52.454
Thank you, sir. Thanks.

14:52.493 --> 14:56.862
lf l could have a day or two
to discuss it with my wife?

14:56.897 --> 14:59.764
Great, great, thanks.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.267
Okay.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.768
Good... Good-bye.

15:02.803 --> 15:05.363
So, it's Boise, huh?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.805
lt sure is.

15:07.841 --> 15:09.934
Congratulations, honey.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.501
You deserve it.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.170
Thanks.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.646
You've been great
about this, you know.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.706
So, when do we go?

15:16.750 --> 15:20.413
Well, l start
a month from today.

15:20.454 --> 15:22.684
l guess l better wipe
those peaches off your face,

15:22.723 --> 15:24.782
so we can start
packing, huh?

15:26.126 --> 15:27.821
Let's go to ldaho.

15:37.838 --> 15:40.068
-Hi, honey.
-Hey.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.972
Hello.
What's Steve doing here?

15:42.009 --> 15:44.534
No offense, but l'm
feeling a little conspiracy.

15:44.645 --> 15:46.670
-Just hear us out, okay?
-Kelly, please.

15:46.713 --> 15:47.907
l've been putting off
all those people

15:47.948 --> 15:49.142
that have been calling for you.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.740
Just like you told me to.

15:50.784 --> 15:51.773
Good. Thank you.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.445
Except for this one guy.

15:53.487 --> 15:54.784
Here we go.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.221
His name is Mark Magadan.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.451
he's got a great track record,

15:58.492 --> 15:59.459
and everyone says
he's wonderful.

15:59.493 --> 16:00.482
Mother...

16:00.527 --> 16:01.789
He wants to meet you.

16:01.828 --> 16:02.954
What's that gonna hurt?

16:02.996 --> 16:05.157
Look, l know you both
just want to help,

16:05.198 --> 16:07.428
but you don't have
to sit there sucking it up

16:07.467 --> 16:08.798
while some guy checks out
all your flaws.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.063
No. But l'll be right
there with you.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.071
-You will?
-Every minute.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.094
The second you start
feeling uncomfortable,

16:13.140 --> 16:14.164
we're out of there.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.299
Steve, l already
feel uncomfortable,

16:15.342 --> 16:16.468
because this is how
it's gonna go.

16:16.510 --> 16:17.602
He's gonna look at me,

16:17.644 --> 16:18.770
then he's gonna look
at my scars

16:18.812 --> 16:21.007
and then he'll say,

16:21.048 --> 16:22.447
''Don't call us, we'll call you.''

16:22.482 --> 16:23.608
Well, no thank you.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.141
You'll never know
unless you meet him.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.744
Well, then l guess
l'll never know.

16:27.788 --> 16:29.119
Kelly, come on, just spend

16:29.156 --> 16:30.783
a half hour with the guy.
For me?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.689
What do you get out of it,
Steve, ten percent?

16:32.726 --> 16:33.852
l was gonna say

16:33.894 --> 16:37.421
15%%, but look,
zero would be fine,

16:37.464 --> 16:38.761
if you'd just meet the man.

16:43.036 --> 16:46.130
All right, l will meet
this Mark Magadan.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.731
Great.

16:47.774 --> 16:48.798
But don't expect too much.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.537
Let's go.

16:50.644 --> 16:52.509
Where?

16:52.546 --> 16:53.808
Upstairs.

16:53.847 --> 16:54.871
His office is upstairs?

16:54.915 --> 16:56.212
He's expecting us.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.911
Well, don't give me any time
to prepare or anything.

16:58.952 --> 17:00.180
What're you gonna do?

17:00.220 --> 17:01.414
Put some more lipstick on?
l don't think so.

17:01.455 --> 17:02.422
You're beautiful, Kelly.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.981
l'm only doing
this for you.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.890
-Right.
-Good luck.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.791
-Thanks, Mother.
-See you later.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.935
Well, what do you think?

17:24.377 --> 17:26.141
Wow.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.146
Now tell me the truth.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.172
l want to look nice for you.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.117
Well, it's, it's not
the Grand Ole Opry, Mom.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.780
l mean, most of the people there
are gonna be wearing

17:34.821 --> 17:37.449
jeans and T-shirts.

17:37.491 --> 17:40.790
Donna's gonna be wearing
just an old T-shirt?

17:40.827 --> 17:44.160
Well, maybe not Donna,
but everybody else.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.189
Okay, l'll try to put on
something a little less, vivid.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.963
Just want to make my son happy.

17:49.002 --> 17:51.630
Hey, Mom, what do you got there?

17:51.672 --> 17:53.264
Just a little grapefruit juice.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.967
Just grapefruit juice?

17:55.008 --> 17:58.341
Okay, Mr. lnquisitor.

17:58.378 --> 18:01.677
Grapefruit juice with just the
tiniest splash of something.

18:01.715 --> 18:03.478
When did this start up again?

18:05.185 --> 18:06.743
You were on the road.

18:06.787 --> 18:08.652
l needed something
to keep me company.

18:08.689 --> 18:10.213
Well, l'm back now.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.248
And l'm fine, right?

18:12.292 --> 18:14.783
Are you?

18:14.828 --> 18:16.659
Okay, so l'm a little nervous

18:16.697 --> 18:19.495
for my son the rock star,
that's all.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.763
Don't mistake parental
concern for intoxication.

18:34.848 --> 18:37.282
Did l tell you
or did l tell you?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.478
Yeah, he was so nice!

18:39.519 --> 18:42.283
Did l earn my zero percent
or what? You tell me.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.483
l thought he was going
to be some slick guy,

18:44.524 --> 18:45.991
making big promises
he can't carry out,

18:46.026 --> 18:47.425
but he was so
down to earth.

18:47.461 --> 18:48.723
He was very optimistic about

18:48.762 --> 18:50.787
getting you print work
right away.

18:50.831 --> 18:53.800
And most importantly, he said
my scar was barely noticeable.

18:53.834 --> 18:55.233
That's what l've
been telling you!

18:55.268 --> 18:56.826
Kelly, that's what
everybody's been telling you.

18:56.870 --> 18:58.861
l guess l just didn't
want to admit to myself

18:58.905 --> 19:00.896
that l actually had
a good time doing the cover.

19:00.941 --> 19:02.101
You see that?

19:02.142 --> 19:03.370
That's just the beginning.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.379
l'm gonna put your face
on five of these magazines.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.278
You know, Kelly, when you
walk past this newsstand,

19:08.315 --> 19:09.805
you're gonna think
you've been cloned.

19:09.850 --> 19:11.283
Um, excuse me?

19:11.318 --> 19:12.842
ls that you?

19:12.886 --> 19:14.649
Yeah, it is.

19:16.556 --> 19:17.818
l told you so.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.656
l say we go

19:20.694 --> 19:22.491
right back up there
and sign with him.

19:22.596 --> 19:26.123
Steve, isn't that Dana?

19:26.166 --> 19:27.599
Who?

19:27.634 --> 19:30.467
Dana, Alison's friend--
from the fire?

19:32.539 --> 19:35.337
Oh, yes, Alison's friend.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.206
Dana.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.973
Hi.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.071
Kelly Taylor.

19:41.114 --> 19:43.139
The Kelly Taylor?

19:43.183 --> 19:44.616
The one and only.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.983
Listen, l'm sorry
l didn't return your calls.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.284
Yeah? So was l.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.449
l've just been going
through a rough time.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.959
You know, l don't
need any excuses.

19:53.994 --> 19:56.690
Dana, how's Alison?

19:56.730 --> 19:58.527
ls she still at the
Claremont Burn Center?

19:58.565 --> 20:01.466
No. She's sunning herself
in the Bahamas.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.430
You know, you're right.

20:04.471 --> 20:07.201
She does kind of
look like Barbie.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.333
What was that about?

20:09.376 --> 20:10.934
She called me
a couple of times,

20:10.977 --> 20:12.911
but that was when l
was involved with Finley.

20:12.946 --> 20:14.311
She must be mad at me

20:14.347 --> 20:16.474
because l haven't gone to
visit Alison in so long.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.279
Come on, you gotta
forget about them.

20:18.318 --> 20:21.913
l can't just forget
about them.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.219
-Walk me to my car, will ya?
-Yeah.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.481
Hey.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.281
You better eat.
lt's going to be a full house.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.948
Maybe you should
give it to my mom.

20:55.989 --> 20:57.456
She's camped out at the bar,

20:57.490 --> 21:00.015
about ready to make
a fool of herself.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.322
Oh, no.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.522
l just got to try
and keep my mind off her

21:03.630 --> 21:04.756
and concentrate on the show.

21:04.798 --> 21:06.231
Do you want me to talk to her?

21:08.034 --> 21:10.400
l want you to get rid of her.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.484
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.510
Everybody's so psyched.

21:29.556 --> 21:30.921
How's our guy?

21:30.957 --> 21:32.788
Well, watching his mother
get plastered

21:32.826 --> 21:34.953
isn't doing much
for his state of mind.

21:34.995 --> 21:38.158
What a nightmare.

21:38.198 --> 21:39.927
Yeah, Ray really
wants her out of here,

21:39.966 --> 21:42.230
but l don't want
to humiliate her, so...

21:42.269 --> 21:43.964
Well, l'll take care of it.

21:45.105 --> 21:46.834
One more, right here.

21:50.477 --> 21:51.535
What?

21:51.578 --> 21:53.239
Hi, Lu Ann.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.578
What, are you cutting me off?

21:55.615 --> 21:57.014
l think you've had enough.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.678
Don't talk to me like that,
you little viper.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.186
Do you want to ruin
this for your son?

22:01.221 --> 22:03.815
What l want is a damn drink!

22:03.857 --> 22:04.983
Now, there's a girl

22:05.025 --> 22:06.356
l can stand the sight of.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.860
Come here, Donna.
Come here, honey.

22:07.894 --> 22:08.918
Come here, sweetheart.

22:08.962 --> 22:10.224
Help me out.

22:10.263 --> 22:13.357
Lu Ann... um, maybe
you'd better go home.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.425
l came to see my boy play,

22:15.468 --> 22:17.333
and that's just
what l'm going to do.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.860
l know, but l don't think

22:18.905 --> 22:20.873
he'd want to see you
in this condition.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.239
Donna, why don't you go
get Clare and David, okay?

22:23.276 --> 22:25.540
Maybe they'll give
Lu Ann a ride home.

22:25.578 --> 22:28.046
l'll be right back, okay?

22:28.081 --> 22:32.040
Where do you get off,
you bossy little tramp?

22:32.085 --> 22:34.883
Lu Ann, this is
your son's night,

22:34.921 --> 22:37.446
and you are an embarrassment.

22:46.967 --> 22:49.128
Cheap little slut.

22:49.169 --> 22:50.932
Okay, car's right
over here, Mrs. Pruit.

22:50.971 --> 22:52.370
l don't know how any of you

22:52.405 --> 22:54.566
can stand being around
that low-rent trash.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.164
l ought to tell her that
to her face.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.369
No, no, no.
Come on, come on.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.934
We're going to get
back in the car, okay?

22:58.979 --> 23:00.947
Come on... There you go...

23:00.981 --> 23:04.178
Oh, boy! Get up. Come on.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.717
She's probably
in there right now,

23:08.755 --> 23:10.518
trying to put the make on him.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.717
On who?

23:11.758 --> 23:12.952
Who do you think? Ray.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.628
Wait a second.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.360
Valerie and-and... and Ray?

23:20.400 --> 23:22.197
l'll tell you this much.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.328
She may have slept
with him once or twice,

23:24.371 --> 23:28.637
but l am not letting her
get her hooks into him again.

23:40.353 --> 23:42.287
So, is it true what l hear?

23:42.322 --> 23:45.314
We're going to lose you
to the Spud State?

23:45.358 --> 23:47.383
They call it the Gem State,
thank you very much,

23:47.427 --> 23:49.054
and it's supposed to
be quaint and scenic.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.791
But does it have
a medical school?

23:51.831 --> 23:53.731
lt's got a clerkship
for Jesse.

23:53.767 --> 23:56.827
That wasn't my question.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.428
What about med school?

23:58.471 --> 24:00.439
Now, Nat, why should
l be a doctor

24:00.473 --> 24:04.341
when l can be a potato
farmer or a couch potato?

24:04.377 --> 24:06.368
Come on, everybody!
The show's starting!

24:09.716 --> 24:11.650
Can l have
your attention, please?

24:11.684 --> 24:15.518
Let's see, well, he's been
in Provo and Portland,

24:15.588 --> 24:16.885
and even Reno had the privilege.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.153
But he could cross the country
and never find a crowd

24:19.192 --> 24:21.353
cooler than you guys.

24:21.394 --> 24:23.385
He's found his way home;
he's ready and rested;

24:23.430 --> 24:25.591
please welcome back Ray Pruit!

24:39.846 --> 24:41.006
Thank you, guys.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.818
What a scene.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.945
l thought we would never
get that woman to bed.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.547
So is she okay now?

24:50.623 --> 24:53.490
No. The woman
is seriously disturbed.

24:53.526 --> 24:54.959
So what are you saying?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.461
We shouldn't believe
anything she said?

24:56.496 --> 24:58.430
ln vino veritas.

24:58.465 --> 25:01.025
You know, Clare, l really
hate it when you speak French.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.297
lt's Latin, David,

25:03.336 --> 25:05.600
and it means,
''ln wine, there's truth.''

25:07.740 --> 25:09.901
Ray and Valerie--
l just... l can't see it.

25:09.943 --> 25:11.706
l can.
Thinking back now,

25:11.744 --> 25:13.871
there's so many times l've seen
Valerie checking him out.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.244
This is just going
to kill Donna.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.511
Exactly. That's why she's not
going to hear it from us.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.075
So we're just gonna play dumb

25:20.120 --> 25:21.348
and-and pretend
we didn't hear it?

25:21.387 --> 25:23.014
Yeah. You got it.

25:23.056 --> 25:25.217
So strap on a smile.
Let's get back to the club.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.757
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.530
What's the story with Valerie?

25:36.603 --> 25:38.662
Well, she can't make it.
She's tied up at the club.

25:39.772 --> 25:42.468
God...
Well, that spoils everything.

25:42.509 --> 25:44.306
What does it spoil?

25:44.344 --> 25:46.278
We got the VCR, we got
the tape, we got chairs.

25:46.312 --> 25:50.305
Well, you know... ''ze'' evening.

25:50.350 --> 25:53.547
What exactly
did you have in mind?

25:53.586 --> 25:56.987
Well, you know,
l just thought... you know.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.325
You and me and Val makes...

26:01.361 --> 26:03.659
Makes three?
That's what you thought?

26:03.696 --> 26:04.788
l don't believe you.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.925
Hey, l'm not proud.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.992
No. You're a dirty old man.

26:10.036 --> 26:12.869
Hey, you will be, too,
one of these days, bub,

26:12.906 --> 26:14.635
if you're lucky.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.642
Matter of fact,
you probably already were one

26:16.676 --> 26:18.109
in some past life somewhere.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.168
You just don't remember it.

26:19.212 --> 26:21.373
Yeah, probably.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.882
Hey, l see you mooning around
after that Kelly.

26:23.917 --> 26:25.680
l know Valerie's
in second position.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.515
-So what?
-So, if the bug

26:27.587 --> 26:29.179
that you've got for Kelly
is so profound,

26:29.222 --> 26:31.452
why don't you just go off
somewhere and fight for it?

26:31.491 --> 26:33.982
Why don't you just go home?

26:34.027 --> 26:36.120
Hey, don't kick me out, okay?

26:36.162 --> 26:37.629
We can still watch the film.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.393
Yes. Okay.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.865
Sit down,
we'll watch the movie,

26:40.900 --> 26:43.994
but no more talk of this party
of three, all right?

26:44.037 --> 26:47.268
Ooh! Absolutely.

26:50.176 --> 26:53.634
Unless you want
to call Kelly up.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.511
No.

26:55.548 --> 26:58.073
Now our feature presentation.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.379
See you guys later.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.722
Hello.

27:09.762 --> 27:12.162
l was just about to hang up.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.098
Well, lucky for me you didn't.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.397
l was just at
a scintillating symposium

27:16.436 --> 27:18.768
on ''Multiculturalism and You.''

27:18.805 --> 27:20.636
Any revelations?

27:20.673 --> 27:22.664
Just that the majority
of student presidents

27:22.709 --> 27:25.701
think they are the smartest
person in the room.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.043
Present company excluded,
of course.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.673
Of course.

27:29.716 --> 27:31.877
So, tell me what's wrong.

27:31.918 --> 27:33.351
How did you know
something's wrong?

27:33.386 --> 27:36.116
Well, it's a boyfriend's job
to know these things.

27:36.155 --> 27:40.524
Well, l was thinking
of going to see Alison,

27:40.627 --> 27:42.527
in Claremont,
at that burn clinic.

27:42.629 --> 27:45.462
You had a change of heart.
What happened?

27:45.498 --> 27:49.628
Well, l ran into her girlfriend,
and she snubbed me.

27:49.669 --> 27:51.500
That's a drag.

27:51.537 --> 27:53.164
Yeah. But it doesn't matter.

27:53.206 --> 27:55.265
l mean, Alison's
the one l care about.

27:55.308 --> 27:57.538
Then you should
definitely go see her.

27:57.577 --> 27:58.874
l just hope it's not

27:58.911 --> 28:01.004
a case of too little, too late.

28:01.047 --> 28:04.141
l mean, l haven't even seen her
since l left the hospital.

28:04.183 --> 28:07.380
Seeing her now... l don't know.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.944
Then don't go.

28:08.988 --> 28:12.321
First, you tell me to go,
then you tell me not to go.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.122
lt's no wonder
you've become a politician.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.287
And here l thought

28:16.329 --> 28:18.524
l was just being
the smartest guy in the room.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.235
You know, l have to say,

28:23.269 --> 28:24.702
you being out on the road

28:24.737 --> 28:26.500
really gave you
a new edge to your sound.

28:26.606 --> 28:28.369
Yeah.
You were on fire tonight.

28:28.408 --> 28:30.103
And so was the cash register.

28:30.143 --> 28:32.407
We're not complaining.

28:32.445 --> 28:33.503
You know what?

28:33.579 --> 28:35.638
l want to get a picture
for the display case.

28:35.682 --> 28:37.081
Let's not and say we did, huh?

28:37.116 --> 28:38.344
No, no... no, l want
to remember the night

28:38.384 --> 28:40.045
the club came back
from the dead.

28:40.086 --> 28:42.953
l'll go get the camera.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.889
Are you sure you don't want
some dessert or something?

28:44.924 --> 28:47.290
Yeah. Something sweet
would be good.

28:47.327 --> 28:48.817
Okay.
Val, you want something?

28:48.861 --> 28:51.796
Uh... No, thanks.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.162
Okay.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.464
Oh, thank God you guys are back.
How's Ray's mom?

28:57.503 --> 29:01.735
Passed out in her pantyhose.

29:01.774 --> 29:02.832
Well, hopefully, by morning,

29:02.875 --> 29:05.241
no one will remember
anything happened.

29:05.278 --> 29:07.371
Miss Martin, we're ready
for your close-up.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.142
Hey, David, Clare, come on.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.207
l want everybody in the picture.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.740
Oh, no, thanks. Really.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.481
Come on, man. lf l can
say ''cheese,'' anyone can.

29:15.555 --> 29:17.989
No. lt's okay.
You guys go ahead.

29:18.024 --> 29:20.117
Oh, you party poopers.

29:20.159 --> 29:21.626
Okay, let's do it.

29:21.661 --> 29:23.128
Oh, that's good, that's good.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.754
Oh, l like that one.
That's good.

29:24.797 --> 29:27.493
Oh, Val, that's really sweet.

29:27.567 --> 29:29.501
This is making me sick.

29:29.569 --> 29:31.901
-l can't watch this anymore.
-Me either.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.496
We need a kiss, now, come on.

29:33.573 --> 29:35.336
Come on! Give him a grab.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.468
Give him a kiss. Come on.

29:37.510 --> 29:39.910
Whoo! Hot! Oh, l like that.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.416
ls there any chance
Lu Ann was exaggerating?

29:44.450 --> 29:47.180
No. Not after seeing
Valerie hitting on him.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.915
You've got to do something.

29:48.955 --> 29:51.515
Me? What's wrong with you?

29:51.557 --> 29:54.424
You've known her longer.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.189
Yeah, but you live with her.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.662
And you could tell her
in French or Latin.

29:57.697 --> 30:00.427
Or not at all.

30:00.466 --> 30:03.526
This is a mess.

30:03.603 --> 30:06.197
Yeah. You're right.

30:06.239 --> 30:07.536
We can't tell her.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.665
So what are we going to do?

30:24.957 --> 30:26.720
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

30:26.759 --> 30:28.886
Hi. l'm here to see Alison Lash.

30:28.928 --> 30:29.895
Oh, good timing.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.089
l think she just woke up

30:31.130 --> 30:33.064
-from a nap.
-Oh, good.

30:33.099 --> 30:34.999
Uh... Let me just poke
my head in first.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.001
What's your name, dear?

30:36.035 --> 30:37.002
Kelly Taylor.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.094
l won't be a moment.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.759
Um... l'm afraid

31:05.798 --> 31:08.426
Alison isn't available
for visitors right now.

31:08.468 --> 31:10.629
Oh, that's okay. l can wait.

31:10.670 --> 31:14.663
l don't think that
would be such a good idea.

31:14.707 --> 31:17.403
-Why not?
-Listen. l really don't

31:17.443 --> 31:19.035
want to get in the middle
of this.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.911
Look, l drove
all the way down here from L.A.

31:21.948 --> 31:24.382
At least l could just say hello.

31:24.417 --> 31:26.248
l'm sorry, honey,

31:26.285 --> 31:28.810
but she specifically said
she didn't want to see you.

31:39.332 --> 31:41.562
Hello.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.862
ls Dana here?

31:43.903 --> 31:47.031
No. She just went to the market.

31:47.073 --> 31:50.531
Well, l'll wait,
if you don't mind.

31:50.576 --> 31:54.034
l don't mind. Come on in.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.184
My name's Kate,

32:04.223 --> 32:07.192
by the way,
in case you're interested.

32:07.226 --> 32:11.128
You can call me Barbie.

32:11.163 --> 32:15.122
Okay, Barbie.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.362
Can l get you something
while you wait?

32:17.403 --> 32:20.429
Water, coffee, Valium?

32:20.473 --> 32:22.634
Oh, is that your way
of trying to be funny?

32:22.675 --> 32:26.042
No, you just seem
a little uptight.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.409
Yeah? Well,

32:27.446 --> 32:30.074
you try spending hours
driving back and forth

32:30.116 --> 32:32.516
to the Claremont Burn Center
for no reason.

32:32.552 --> 32:36.147
Was Alison in one of her moods?

32:36.188 --> 32:38.213
l wouldn't know.
She wouldn't see me.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.316
Any idea why?

32:40.359 --> 32:41.519
l think Dana should be the one

32:41.561 --> 32:43.290
having this conversation
with you.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.092
Yeah, well, Dana isn't here,
and you are,

32:45.131 --> 32:47.292
and l am tired
of being out in the dark.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.062
Do me a favor.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.466
Don't yell at me
in my own house, okay?

32:50.503 --> 32:52.733
You live here, too?

32:52.772 --> 32:56.401
Yes. This is my home,
and Dana and l are lovers,

32:56.442 --> 32:57.875
if that's what you're asking.

32:57.910 --> 33:00.105
No. lt wasn't.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.944
Are you uncomfortable with that?

33:02.982 --> 33:04.609
No, not at all.

33:04.650 --> 33:09.610
Um... l just thought that, uh,
Dana and Alison were a couple.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.351
Well, they broke up
in December...

33:12.391 --> 33:15.383
not too long after the fire.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.191
And now you're
probably thinking

33:17.229 --> 33:19.857
that Dana is some heartless,
superficial bitch

33:19.899 --> 33:21.161
who dumped Alison

33:21.200 --> 33:23.259
because she was in
the hospital, right?

33:23.302 --> 33:24.701
The thought did cross my mind.

33:24.737 --> 33:27.706
Well, here's something else
to think about.

33:27.740 --> 33:29.901
lt wasn't Dana who
couldn't handle things,

33:29.942 --> 33:32.137
it was Alison who broke it off.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.646
And what does that
have to do with me?

33:35.848 --> 33:38.840
You don't know Alison
too well, do you?

33:38.884 --> 33:40.943
No. We met the night
of the fire.

33:40.987 --> 33:43.148
What, does she hate me now

33:43.189 --> 33:46.522
because l wasn't burnt
as badly as she was?

33:46.559 --> 33:48.356
Hate you?

33:48.394 --> 33:51.192
lt's just the opposite.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.528
While Alison was
in the hospital,

33:53.566 --> 33:57.400
she decided that she wasn't
in love with Dana anymore,

33:57.436 --> 33:59.768
because she was in love
with you.

34:01.741 --> 34:03.402
And part of Alison's problem is,

34:03.442 --> 34:05.535
she thinks
she's still in love with you.

34:09.782 --> 34:12.909
Can l get you
that tranquilizer now?

34:34.040 --> 34:37.498
David, what brings you down
to my side of the tracks?

34:37.543 --> 34:38.942
Turn into a Valley boy?

34:38.978 --> 34:40.536
Uh, not likely. How you doing?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.137
Hey, l didn't get to thank

34:42.181 --> 34:45.241
you and Clare for hustling my
mother out of there last night.

34:45.284 --> 34:48.117
She's, uh, paying for
it today, believe me.

34:48.154 --> 34:50.384
Yeah, well, l'm not surprised.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.721
Can l, uh, get you
something to drink, or...?

34:52.757 --> 34:56.387
No. Actually, uh,
this isn't a social visit.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.090
Look, Ray,

34:58.130 --> 35:01.463
l don't know you very well,
but after Portland...

35:01.500 --> 35:04.958
l figured if Donna loved you,
well, then you're okay.

35:05.004 --> 35:07.438
Well, thanks
for the vote of confidence.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.373
Look, Ray, l know you've been

35:09.408 --> 35:11.239
screwing around with Valerie.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.507
And what gave you that idea?

35:13.612 --> 35:16.445
Your mom's got a big mouth.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.448
All right, look, l messed up.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.750
There's not a minute
that goes by

35:22.788 --> 35:24.722
that l don't regret it.

35:24.757 --> 35:27.920
She just came on to me
so strong one night.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.257
You know how it is.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.126
Yeah, l know.

35:31.163 --> 35:33.825
That's how l lost Donna
in the first place.

35:33.866 --> 35:35.663
Does Donna know yet?

35:35.701 --> 35:37.635
No.

35:37.670 --> 35:40.036
And l'm not gonna tell her.

35:40.072 --> 35:42.233
But l will
if it happens again

35:42.274 --> 35:44.333
with anyone, you understand?

35:44.376 --> 35:46.606
lt's not gonna happen again.

35:47.980 --> 35:52.041
l trust you, but, uh,
just know, l'm watching, okay?

36:05.798 --> 36:10.098
What the hell did you tell
those people last night?

36:22.815 --> 36:24.077
Clare, come on in.

36:24.116 --> 36:28.075
Oh, l want you to hear
my latest, okay?

36:28.120 --> 36:32.250
Don't look now,
Pruit's back and we got him.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.758
Enough said.

36:33.793 --> 36:35.385
See you After Dark, kids.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.326
What?

36:40.366 --> 36:41.924
You don't like it?

36:41.967 --> 36:43.832
lt's okay.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.133
lt's you that leaves me cold.

36:46.172 --> 36:48.299
What did l do now?

36:48.340 --> 36:50.308
You know, l don't get you.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.673
You've got the money,

36:51.710 --> 36:54.201
looks, the attitude....

36:54.246 --> 36:56.714
You could have virtually any guy
on the Westside that you want.

36:56.749 --> 36:58.478
Get to your point, Clare?

36:58.517 --> 37:00.542
Why did you have
to go for the one guy

37:00.653 --> 37:01.881
that Donna Martin's
in love with?

37:01.921 --> 37:04.321
Excuse me?

37:04.356 --> 37:06.483
Please, all right?
Lu Ann told us all about

37:06.592 --> 37:08.856
-you and Ray.
-ls the glue uncapped here?

37:08.894 --> 37:12.125
-Don't do this, Valerie.
-Look, Clare, we're friends.

37:12.164 --> 37:14.223
Are you gonna believe
that lush over me?

37:14.266 --> 37:15.358
What are you gonna do

37:15.401 --> 37:16.800
when she starts
saying stuff about you?

37:16.836 --> 37:18.030
Gee, you're good at this, huh?

37:18.070 --> 37:19.594
You don't believe me?

37:19.638 --> 37:20.696
No.

37:20.739 --> 37:24.436
But obviously, you believe you.

37:24.476 --> 37:28.606
l guess that's how you can stand
being with yourself, huh?

37:28.647 --> 37:30.410
Clare, wait, just don't do this.

37:30.449 --> 37:33.441
Stay away from him, all right?

37:44.296 --> 37:46.856
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:46.899 --> 37:48.730
Sweetie, what are you doing?

37:48.767 --> 37:50.257
Research. Listen to this.

37:50.302 --> 37:53.533
''Wheat fields and mineshafts,
logging trucks and combines,

37:53.572 --> 37:57.030
''cowboys and nuclear
physicists-- these are ldaho.''

37:57.076 --> 37:58.441
Mm!

37:58.477 --> 38:00.707
Don't know if that sounds like
a place to call home.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.010
Well, somewhere between
the cowboys and the physicists,

38:03.048 --> 38:04.640
l'm sure we'll find our niche.

38:04.683 --> 38:07.015
Well, you can
put that book away,

38:07.052 --> 38:08.883
because we're not going.

38:08.921 --> 38:11.151
What do you mean,
we're not going?

38:11.190 --> 38:14.489
Well, Judge Jiminez and l
had a heart-to-heart today.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.493
He didn't rescind his offer,
did he?

38:16.595 --> 38:21.157
No... no, but l ended up
telling him that,

38:21.200 --> 38:23.031
in the final analysis...

38:23.068 --> 38:26.367
being in Boise just wasn't
the right thing for me.

38:26.405 --> 38:29.932
But, Jesse, that's
exactly what you wanted.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.966
Well, yeah, for me,
it was an opportunity,

38:32.011 --> 38:34.104
but like l told the judge,
unfortunately,

38:34.146 --> 38:36.637
you don't have
a medical school in ldaho.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.950
You said that?

38:42.288 --> 38:44.620
Really?
Did you really say that?

38:46.525 --> 38:48.083
l love you.

38:48.127 --> 38:49.788
l love you, too.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.899
No, Mom, it's not...

38:54.934 --> 38:57.801
l have nothing
against Mark Magadan.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.669
l just... l'm not ready
to make a commitment...

39:00.706 --> 39:02.333
to anybody.

39:02.374 --> 39:05.104
Steve is gonna be
so disappointed.

39:05.144 --> 39:07.806
Yeah, l am just one
big disappointment.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.643
Kelly!

39:09.682 --> 39:11.650
Good night, Mother.

39:11.684 --> 39:13.117
Everything okay?

39:13.152 --> 39:15.586
No. Between my mother and Steve,

39:15.621 --> 39:17.885
they are gonna
drive me up a wall.

39:19.425 --> 39:20.790
l itch so bad.

39:20.826 --> 39:24.318
That's because
you don't let your skin breathe.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.957
Don't you start with me, too.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.502
What do you want
to bet that's Steve?

39:30.602 --> 39:31.500
Hello.

39:31.603 --> 39:32.501
Kelly.

39:32.604 --> 39:34.663
Uh, can you hold on?

39:34.707 --> 39:37.198
l'll just take it in my room.

39:41.914 --> 39:43.279
Hello.

39:43.315 --> 39:45.010
Kelly, hi.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.517
lt's great to hear your voice.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.449
lt's good to hear yours,
too, Alison.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.681
Listen,

39:49.722 --> 39:52.418
um, l-l wanted to apologize
for this morning.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.756
You know, you came
all the way down here

39:54.793 --> 39:56.351
to see me, and l just....

39:56.395 --> 39:58.386
No, that's okay. l understand.

39:58.430 --> 40:01.695
lt's just that sometimes
the pain in my legs

40:01.734 --> 40:05.534
gets pretty intense,
and l'm not very good company.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.902
l should have come a lot sooner.

40:07.940 --> 40:09.635
No, no, it's okay.

40:09.675 --> 40:11.438
l know you've been really busy

40:11.477 --> 40:13.968
with things at school
and everything.

40:15.147 --> 40:16.546
Um, besides,

40:16.582 --> 40:19.551
l probably wouldn't have wanted
you to see me like this.

40:19.585 --> 40:21.553
Don't be silly.

40:21.620 --> 40:25.021
Yeah, easy
for a cover girl to say.

40:25.057 --> 40:26.752
You saw the magazine.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.487
Yes, l did.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.495
You look stunning.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.724
Thanks, but l've decided

40:32.765 --> 40:35.233
l'm not going to pursue
the modeling career.

40:35.267 --> 40:38.498
But, Kelly, you have to.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.300
You're beautiful.

40:40.339 --> 40:42.671
God's given you a gift.

40:42.708 --> 40:45.575
lt would be a sin not to use it.

40:45.611 --> 40:48.239
That's really
a nice thing to say.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.577
You know, Kelly,

40:49.681 --> 40:52.946
l don't have
any ill will toward you.

40:52.985 --> 40:54.850
Just the opposite.

40:56.822 --> 40:58.790
So, how are you doing?

40:58.824 --> 41:00.314
The doctors say

41:00.359 --> 41:02.054
l'm getting better every day.

41:02.094 --> 41:05.427
One more skin graft and
l'll be suitable for viewing.

41:05.464 --> 41:06.658
That's great.

41:06.698 --> 41:07.824
So, when l'm all better,

41:07.866 --> 41:09.731
will you, will you
come back and see me?

41:09.768 --> 41:11.292
ln, like, a month or so?

41:11.336 --> 41:14.499
Alison, there are some things
l think we need to talk about.

41:14.540 --> 41:15.802
l agree.

41:15.841 --> 41:19.709
But l think we need to talk
about them face-to-face.

41:19.745 --> 41:22.714
Do you promise that
you'll come see me...

41:22.748 --> 41:24.943
face-to-face?

41:26.852 --> 41:28.820
l promise.

41:28.854 --> 41:31.823
Thanks.

41:31.857 --> 41:35.293
That's what l needed to hear.

41:35.327 --> 41:37.261
Good night, Kelly.

41:38.297 --> 41:40.458
Good night, Alison.

42:11.797 --> 42:13.924
You know, the most comforting
thing about the trip

42:13.966 --> 42:15.194
was discovering that C.U.

42:15.234 --> 42:17.702
is not the most screwed-up
school in the state.

42:17.736 --> 42:18.862
That's a plus.

42:18.904 --> 42:21.099
What about financial aid?

42:21.140 --> 42:22.937
l mean, all the kids
at the graduate school

42:22.975 --> 42:23.964
are worried about tuition hikes.

42:24.009 --> 42:25.499
Hm-- it'll never happen.

42:25.544 --> 42:26.636
lt's just a rumor.

42:26.678 --> 42:28.339
Hi.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.678
Hey. l just called over
at the beach apartment

42:30.716 --> 42:31.910
trying to find you.

42:31.950 --> 42:33.850
Well, here l am.
What'd you do,

42:33.886 --> 42:35.285
buy out the whole newsstand?

42:35.320 --> 42:36.844
Well, l... kind of had to.

42:36.889 --> 42:39.414
When some of the other
student body presidents

42:39.458 --> 42:41.551
found out you were my
girlfriend, they...

42:41.660 --> 42:43.093
kind of demanded

42:43.128 --> 42:45.187
autographed copies--
but, you know, you don't

42:45.230 --> 42:47.255
have to sign 'em if
you don't want to.

42:47.299 --> 42:48.664
Jim, can l borrow your pen?

42:48.700 --> 42:50.190
Sure.

42:50.235 --> 42:51.566
And if you're signing,

42:51.670 --> 42:53.137
could l have
one of those?

42:53.172 --> 42:55.163
Oh, and... one for Brenda.

42:55.207 --> 42:58.370
Well, this was easier
than l thought it would be.

42:58.410 --> 42:59.809
Well, l figure if l'm gonna

42:59.845 --> 43:02.678
give this modeling thing a shot,
l better get used to it.

43:02.714 --> 43:04.272
Steve and Jackie did

43:04.316 --> 43:06.807
-a number on you, huh?
-Mm.

43:06.852 --> 43:09.480
Hey, wait a second.

43:09.521 --> 43:11.045
Where's your bandage?

43:12.090 --> 43:14.183
l don't need it anymore.
