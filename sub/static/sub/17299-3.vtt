00:21.880 --> 00:25.601
The problem with reflections is,
most are true.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.322
God chose me as king,

00:31.800 --> 00:33.564
yet I'm undermined all around.

00:33.960 --> 00:37.043
People do not yet see you
as they should, Sire.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.200
They will.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.162
What do you want here, Montcourt?

00:59.800 --> 01:03.486
In a downpour,
one shelters under the largest tree.

01:04.239 --> 01:07.164
In the north, there is no one stronger,

01:07.320 --> 01:10.767
no one more powerful,
no one more resolute

01:11.320 --> 01:13.288
than the mighty oak Cassel.

01:13.440 --> 01:17.445
A refugee from this royal deluge,
I need protection, my Lord.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.485
I am your servant.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.201
Servant...

01:24.560 --> 01:28.451
Behold the divine right of kings
and its gifts.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.411
Your king's new law

01:32.520 --> 01:34.602
strips a true noble of dignity,

01:34.920 --> 01:38.527
defiles a reputation that's part of
this country's bedrock.

01:38.920 --> 01:42.242
Once, not long ago,
we knew where we stood,

01:43.080 --> 01:46.050
now we must prove ourselves,
sing for our supper.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.168
Now the king says "I am France",

01:48.320 --> 01:51.927
but I say it is we who are France.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.450
Our friend Montcourt's
condition is a message.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.126
The king shall have his reply.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.450
The king obsesses
over his new playground.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.330
He sees only Versailles,
he's forgotten who built this country.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.329
If we removed this distraction,
he might recover himself,

02:12.680 --> 02:15.809
Versailles returning to weeds,
the king to Paris

02:15.960 --> 02:19.885
and we, to our lands and our lives.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.400
A noble cause indeed.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.525
Persuasion by force?

02:30.360 --> 02:33.364
He's lost his mind.
No appeal to reason will do.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.491
France's future
is with its noble families.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.083
You wish protection, Montcourt?

02:42.680 --> 02:45.047
I serve My Lordship with my life.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.931
Indeed you will.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.689
What do you think of me?

02:53.880 --> 02:54.642
Sire?

02:54.800 --> 02:57.963
- Am I merciful?
- If you desire it.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.601
- Vengeful?
- If conditions merit.

03:00.760 --> 03:04.606
- All things to all people?
- Equally, without condition.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.843
- As a king. I ask as a man.
- You are both.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.162
We cannot separate the two.

03:12.040 --> 03:14.486
As a king, I send my brother to war.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.449
I'd mourn as a man if he died.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.410
As a man
I'd gain favour in another's eyes.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.921
As king I can't.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.969
You're always in favour, Sire.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.168
Does Montcourt feel the same?

03:30.480 --> 03:33.927
A king is resented
as much for good deeds as bad.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.729
It fits well, Sire.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.164
I don't like this mirror.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.562
<i>♪ I'm the king of my own land,</i>

03:59.800 --> 04:03.009
<i>♪ Facing tempests of dust,</i>

04:03.160 --> 04:07.643
<i>♪ I'll fight until the end.</i>

04:11.840 --> 04:17.483
♪ <i>Creatures of my dreams,
rise up and dance with me!</i>

04:26.240 --> 04:33.849
<i>♪ Now and forever,
♪ I'm your king.</i>

05:00.880 --> 05:03.247
- Well, well!
- Majesty!

05:03.400 --> 05:05.289
My dear Rohan, you're back

05:05.440 --> 05:08.641
I always do as you say

05:11.680 --> 05:14.001
- I've missed you.
- And I you.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.331
More pretty women here
than I remember.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.687
You forgot.
You're getting old!

05:19.960 --> 05:23.282
- I can only be myself.
- That I already know.

05:23.440 --> 05:26.205
I've learned my lesson,
I return atoned, anew

05:26.360 --> 05:29.125
and at your service, Sire.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.562
I saw the plans for the stable.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.241
And?

05:35.400 --> 05:38.210
Either we're hunting an awful lot,

05:39.000 --> 05:43.324
or you're building
something quite different here.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.364
- A palace, perhaps?
- A city.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.120
I wish you luck.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.562
France thanks you.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.921
- How is my queen?
- Much better, thank you.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.680
No more black.

06:29.160 --> 06:32.448
Mourning's over.
Resume your official duties.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.011
Yes.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.209
There'll be a guest at court.
You'll host them.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.290
Shower attention on them

06:39.440 --> 06:42.444
with your customary warmth and grace.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.207
Who is it? I'll plan conversation.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.530
Spanish, perhaps?

06:50.480 --> 06:51.720
Prince Annaba.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.800
You have my word.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.730
I will depend on it.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.964
Sire, if I may be so bold,

07:09.960 --> 07:14.170
I believe Her Majesty
has met our visitor once before.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.923
Yes, in Paris.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.848
Why then
would you compel the queen once more

07:22.000 --> 07:25.402
into a private audience with him?

07:27.920 --> 07:30.287
African lands are a locked room

07:30.960 --> 07:33.361
and Prince Annaba may hold the key.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.845
Missionaries to the Senegal River say

07:37.360 --> 07:40.011
there is immeasurable wealth there.

07:40.320 --> 07:44.041
Its people and trade
are the foundations of our future,

07:44.680 --> 07:48.571
will fund a thousand wars,
a hundred palaces.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.444
We must win Africa.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.208
The only question is how?

07:53.760 --> 07:55.125
And the queen?

07:57.080 --> 07:58.320
Is helping us.

08:16.520 --> 08:17.328
How do I look?

08:17.480 --> 08:20.131
I dressed you.
What do you think I think?

08:21.160 --> 08:24.243
Who puts a dwarf in a drainpipe?

08:24.880 --> 08:25.880
What?

08:25.960 --> 08:28.122
If he was sad, maybe he did.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.282
Or did the queen tire of him?

08:30.440 --> 08:32.568
Did he try to mend the fountains

08:32.720 --> 08:35.883
to regain favour,
and put himself in as a cork,

08:36.039 --> 08:40.125
only to float up
and scare the young people.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.521
You're too idle!

08:45.800 --> 08:47.165
Come to the front.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.971
You're inviting me to a war?

08:52.120 --> 08:54.282
Oh, how romantic.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.002
- Are you mad?
- Not any war.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.527
My war.

09:01.680 --> 09:05.162
What your brother says, what he does...
Don't be so sure.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.845
If you do go,
I shall stay here, naturally,

09:10.160 --> 09:11.969
to keep your place at court.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.281
Is that so?

09:14.760 --> 09:18.287
How generous of you, to ensure my place!

09:20.400 --> 09:22.084
- You look good.
- I told him.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.730
You did not, in fact.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.769
Husband, is there news?

09:27.960 --> 09:28.961
Not yet.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.926
Bontemps!

09:33.720 --> 09:34.881
Bontemps!

09:36.800 --> 09:39.849
I have a sword, amour and a horse.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.321
Why the delay? When do I go to war?

09:42.480 --> 09:44.801
The king has not yet set a date.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.849
What shall I do until then?

09:47.880 --> 09:49.723
Maybe he'll send you instead.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.561
- I'd be happy to serve.
- Naturally!

09:52.720 --> 09:55.121
You think he doesn't see what you are?

09:55.440 --> 09:58.046
Oh, he sees me. And he enjoys it.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.971
That's what divides us.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.926
When your husband's gone,
I can find you.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.569
If you come to my rooms,
I will not answer.

10:06.720 --> 10:10.281
I wouldn't seek you there,
nor the king with Her Majesty.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.681
I know how you enjoy swimming.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.003
I might find you at the pool house,
for example.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.567
I hear it's very popular
for young lovers of nature.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.525
You are warned, sir.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.126
Constantly, my dear.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.561
Nice house.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.124
Honored guest of the king

12:07.880 --> 12:09.689
Annaba, Prince of Assinie.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.842
Son of the king of Eguafo,

12:12.000 --> 12:16.767
inheritor of the Coast of Ivory
and Teeth, Lord of the Sky.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.801
My brother, Kobina.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.489
Prince Annaba,
accompany me, please, uh, alone.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.246
Your brother will go with Mr Marchal.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.926
And my friends?

12:30.320 --> 12:33.483
Will bask in the warmth
of the king's hospitality.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.890
Are you sure?

12:51.040 --> 12:52.246
It's beautiful!

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
Thank you.

12:55.640 --> 12:56.846
Ah, so handsome!

12:59.320 --> 13:01.482
How can a black man be handsome?

13:01.640 --> 13:03.369
How can he not?

13:03.520 --> 13:05.602
You're so odd!

13:06.400 --> 13:08.402
His lands have rivers of gold.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.803
How far is it to the trees?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.242
Majesty, as requested it's done.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.801
Prince Annaba's suitably ill at ease.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.610
Good! Make him wait.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.926
I heard
that my friends the Parthenays

14:02.080 --> 14:04.242
are riding here from the south.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.643
- Little Françoise is coming?
- With husband and family.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.325
How time has flown.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.728
They're well-regarded there.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.644
For me, they're coming here

14:13.800 --> 14:16.849
to submit their noble credentials
as an example.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.522
The Gazette will report it.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.601
Perhaps strike a medal, Colbert?

14:23.680 --> 14:26.286
Politically, it'll augur great things.

14:26.440 --> 14:30.001
Great southern nobles submit
credentials to the king.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.286
That'll do it.

14:31.440 --> 14:34.808
The king receives credentials
from southern nobles.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.083
Sounds better, doesn't it?

14:40.760 --> 14:41.760
That's a lot of shit!

14:42.080 --> 14:46.529
Only the very finest shit from
the king's horses in the Louvre.

14:48.760 --> 14:49.760
I, um

14:51.080 --> 14:52.764
Speak. What's on your mind?

14:54.160 --> 14:56.208
Coming back through the woods

14:56.560 --> 14:59.643
I saw an old man
cooking a rat by a stream.

15:00.080 --> 15:03.607
- At first I thought he was a tramp.
- But you knew him?

15:06.760 --> 15:08.330
From your father's court.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.361
He opposed him.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.765
During the rebellion?

15:13.520 --> 15:16.490
- Had they been successful -
- You'd be dead.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.602
One day I'd like to know more.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.400
Good day, Prince.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.245
Good day to you,

16:22.160 --> 16:23.286
Highness.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.209
A pleasure to see you again.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.370
What's wrong? You're shaking.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.844
Many reasons.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.005
You, us, him, the Chevalier.

16:55.960 --> 16:59.248
- The Chevalier makes you tremble?
- He scares me,

16:59.920 --> 17:03.970
how he looks at me,
how he talks about you and my husband.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.563
Remember when you were 16?

17:08.599 --> 17:11.843
You stepped on a rose. Your foot bled.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.765
You kissed my toes.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.204
I stopped the pain.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Instantly!

17:23.960 --> 17:25.246
Nothing's changed.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.242
I'll always make sure of it.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.211
You can't protect me
when I am with him.

17:32.360 --> 17:36.126
You've nothing
to worry about from the Chevalier

17:37.440 --> 17:38.930
or your husband.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.684
I'm your safe harbor.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.281
Protect me from the waves?

17:44.440 --> 17:45.566
Yes.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.243
Even as the tide takes me.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.484
He's ready now.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.240
This way.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.007
Prince Annaba of Assinie,
you're welcome at my court.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.810
Versailles is more beautiful
than I can imagine.

19:18.640 --> 19:22.008
May I present my brother Philippe,
Duke of Orleans,

19:22.160 --> 19:24.003
his wife Henriette of England,

19:24.160 --> 19:26.640
Colbert, my first minister,

19:26.800 --> 19:28.609
Mlle De la Valliere.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.090
You've already met my wife.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.284
When I hosted a party

19:47.760 --> 19:50.491
and didn't have room for my friends

19:50.640 --> 19:54.611
they took rooms in town,
so now I'm building some myself.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.041
400 apartments in all.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.611
Where are the workers?

19:59.760 --> 20:02.081
In the planning stages

20:02.240 --> 20:05.449
of a dangerous part of construction.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.482
Tomorrow we can see them laboring.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.290
I'd like that very much.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.927
Tell me about African countries.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.764
When do we negotiate?

20:15.920 --> 20:18.491
Prince Annaba,
things are different here.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.001
Maybe I'm wrong.

20:21.720 --> 20:26.169
Maybe I should talk to the Dutch,
the Spanish, the English.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.004
They're all keen to talk.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.409
Not enjoying the hospitality?

20:30.560 --> 20:33.291
Hmm! There's a great deal of it!

20:33.440 --> 20:36.569
And more besides, as you'll see tonight.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.368
- What then?
- I'll sit down with you.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.770
I've no explanation.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.362
I'm so very sorry, Mr Marchal.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.726
Half the shipments lost and 4 men dead.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.843
The king's missing

21:04.000 --> 21:08.050
gold, marble, stone and wine.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.364
It's becoming a pattern.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.329
Appearance is everything.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.001
Everything!

21:37.480 --> 21:39.562
Don't you understand?
Has anyone listened?

21:41.360 --> 21:42.521
He's my guest,

21:42.680 --> 21:46.480
and shows more grandeur in clothes
than I can in palaces.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.849
A marble shipment
went missing, Sire, plainly

21:50.000 --> 21:52.162
the men can't work without it.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.444
Did the marble hide itself in the woods?

21:55.880 --> 21:57.086
Thieves, Sire.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.851
Always thieves on the road.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.525
So was it a pickpocket?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.002
This is organized. Sabotage!

22:03.320 --> 22:04.446
We need goods.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.763
We transport
more and more goods to Versailles,

22:07.920 --> 22:10.321
and so the more likely it becomes.

22:10.480 --> 22:14.201
Such incidents become movements which
will ignite our lands.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.044
Buildings need foundations.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.441
- Sire -
- The king's road is sacred!

22:18.600 --> 22:21.570
Sacrosanct, protected and secured.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.724
If not, the country's damaged and torn,

22:24.880 --> 22:26.644
everyone will feel lost.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.002
Someone is declaring war.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.686
I and my men will go and set up patrols.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.448
- At once!
- Yes, Sire.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.440
Wait!

22:45.520 --> 22:48.091
You'd countermand His Majesty?

22:52.400 --> 22:54.482
Not enough men, we're at war!

22:54.640 --> 22:58.201
Priority is protecting the king.
I'll handle the roads.

22:58.840 --> 23:01.684
Ensure your men are of quality.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.207
I need them as my eyes and ears.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.082
My name is Mme De Beauvais.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.289
Your mother sent me.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.285
I'm your new tutor.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.280
What will you teach me, Mme De Beauvais?

24:12.760 --> 24:14.364
Call me Catherine.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.243
Should the workers return
to the scaffolding, Sire?

24:27.400 --> 24:28.481
Yes.

24:29.080 --> 24:30.491
Yes of course.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.331
- Even if they pretend to work.
- Sire?

24:37.640 --> 24:38.880
Where's my brother?

24:40.200 --> 24:42.089
Our visitor's inspired me.

24:42.520 --> 24:44.363
I think I need more color.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.890
How to dress for a war?

24:50.200 --> 24:54.410
- Purple, or red?
- Red, of course.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.249
- I like the purple.
- Me too.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.811
That's why I said red.

25:02.800 --> 25:06.850
Philippe, when you do leave,
make sure to come back.

25:09.160 --> 25:12.050
- I can't promise that.
- Say the words.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.371
If I died your life would be simple,
wouldn't it?

25:19.040 --> 25:22.010
You know my problems
will never be solved.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.410
And I'd rather you didn't die.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.881
- You say the sweetest things, poppet.
- I mean it.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.165
Since we were small,

25:42.280 --> 25:43.725
my dream's been war.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.690
Yours was my brother.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.246
We're so lucky.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.571
One day we may both live our dreams.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.843
<i>We may have war or splendor,</i>

26:19.000 --> 26:21.526
<i>I don't believe we can have both.</i>

26:21.680 --> 26:23.364
<i>Then it's war.</i>

26:24.040 --> 26:27.761
<i>All around you will smile
and they will deal,</i>

26:28.760 --> 26:31.240
<i>but all would see you destroyed, Sire.</i>

26:31.760 --> 26:34.366
<i>You're king of our future.</i>

26:35.440 --> 26:38.649
<i>The only question:
what kind shall it be?</i>

26:39.760 --> 26:42.764
<i>You dream of paradise,</i>

26:44.440 --> 26:47.171
<i>but you must build it for yourself.</i>

26:48.160 --> 26:50.845
<i>Dressed this way since 3 months old,</i>

26:51.000 --> 26:54.129
<i>so as not to be the cloud
hiding the sun.</i>

27:15.320 --> 27:16.606
Amen.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.451
I thought if I started out,
you'd sanction it.

27:20.960 --> 27:23.691
You've blessed me enough now, thank you.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.566
I don't understand.

27:26.720 --> 27:28.210
I await your word.

27:28.360 --> 27:32.001
When I can wait no more,
I'll ask God for deliverance.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.565
Which one are you?

27:41.360 --> 27:45.410
I might be a horse.
At least, that's what I've been told.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.526
Brother...

27:49.840 --> 27:51.080
Want me to be serious?

27:55.040 --> 27:57.247
Always stay close to your guard.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.890
You leave today.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.570
I will bring you glory.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.286
I vow it.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.448
God protect and bring you home.

28:11.800 --> 28:12.926
Go, then.

28:14.520 --> 28:15.520
Run to her

28:17.760 --> 28:19.046
with my blessing.

28:21.680 --> 28:23.603
No need of a priest for that.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.487
<i>'</i> MY dear?
<i>'</i> Yes?

28:44.640 --> 28:47.291
Your help, please. A moral quandary.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.807
Mmm! I'll do my best.

28:50.240 --> 28:53.323
If someone I adore fucks someone else

28:53.480 --> 28:55.403
without my express consent,

28:55.560 --> 28:58.040
isn't it only fair and just

28:58.200 --> 29:00.362
that I fuck someone of my own choosing?

29:00.520 --> 29:01.248
Mm.

29:01.400 --> 29:05.485
I tried to ask Bishop Bosssuet,
but he was most unforthcoming.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.324
- I...
- Sophie, don't reply.

29:07.480 --> 29:10.609
She has replied,
it's written all over her face.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.364
Enough teasing!

29:13.120 --> 29:14.929
We should thank heaven.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.369
- Families have to leave court.
- No papers.

29:19.880 --> 29:23.680
I suppose
there was no one to vouch for them.

29:24.200 --> 29:27.170
That's the law
we must all now comply with.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.482
At least we have our Chevalier.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.524
Why are you being so nice to me?

29:32.680 --> 29:33.680
My Own folly!

29:33.760 --> 29:37.162
I know you'll use us up
and cast us out like the rest.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.367
Naturally!

29:38.800 --> 29:42.327
Fear not,
I'll watch out for you in this madness.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.130
Especially you, my pretty!

29:45.960 --> 29:47.724
<i>'</i> Sophie!
<i>'</i> Oh!

29:47.880 --> 29:49.086
Come at once!

29:52.480 --> 29:53.561
Hand me that trowel!

29:56.520 --> 29:58.409
Mixture's thick, more water!

29:58.560 --> 29:59.607
Sophie.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.846
- It's her name.
- That's a death wish.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.526
Better to die
for what you believe in, yes?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.082
What's your name again?

30:09.240 --> 30:10.401
Benoît, sir.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.200
Jacques.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.565
Why's a gardener up here?

30:14.720 --> 30:17.530
The view
lets me measure the garden's lines.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.565
And girls out walking.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.844
Be careful with that.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.324
- Think of your future, eh?
- I am.

30:29.120 --> 30:33.205
If the Parthenays
prove as meaningful as they might,

30:33.360 --> 30:35.249
their visit, their loyalty,

30:35.400 --> 30:37.926
could encourage compliance in the south.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.806
Leaving who?

30:40.480 --> 30:42.403
The north and east.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.325
Who defies me there?

30:44.840 --> 30:46.888
The Duke of Cassel, Sire, I think,

30:47.040 --> 30:48.849
his influence there is great,

30:49.000 --> 30:50.490
half the nobles owe him.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.883
It's family land historically.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.410
He's our keystone, then.

30:58.560 --> 31:01.882
Take him out of the wall,
the structure collapses.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.008
If not, the collapse is ours.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.122
Our letters to him have had no response.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.966
Send him a gift - my portrait -

31:12.120 --> 31:15.567
with an order to comply with our laws.

31:15.720 --> 31:19.088
He'll supply proof of nobility
or suffer consequences,

31:19.240 --> 31:21.288
all France bearing witness.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.086
King's messenger,

31:29.920 --> 31:31.285
bearing gifts.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.923
How very kind. Some champagne?

31:46.040 --> 31:48.611
Louis the Great summons you to court.

31:49.440 --> 31:53.126
He requires you
to present proof of your nobility.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.040
Really?

32:01.000 --> 32:02.968
I warn you, Kobina,

32:03.280 --> 32:05.931
the king is entertaining in our honor,

32:06.080 --> 32:08.128
but we're not here to have fun.

32:14.720 --> 32:18.247
As long as we leave alive, I don't care

32:21.040 --> 32:22.485
To be sure,

32:22.640 --> 32:26.167
Chevalier does possess
more influence than I thought,

32:26.920 --> 32:29.491
but this is smaller than where we were.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.564
- What I love about being here is...
- What?

32:32.840 --> 32:35.127
Noise. The court's hustle and bustle.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.771
How do I look?

32:45.560 --> 32:47.244
You'll not go out in that!

32:52.720 --> 32:54.324
Huh!

32:55.720 --> 32:57.404
Mother, please don't fuss.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.810
Fuss! This is not a game.

33:00.960 --> 33:05.204
It's my job, to ensure it's you
who catches the king's eye.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.450
Look.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.005
What do you see?

33:11.560 --> 33:13.688
I... see... me.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.811
It's a time not for women,
but for men.

33:16.960 --> 33:21.170
But the wisest king
can be a fool for great beauty.

33:22.320 --> 33:23.810
With that, even if never a queen,

33:24.080 --> 33:27.084
you may live like one.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.765
I do believe

33:33.840 --> 33:35.888
you're the fairest of them all.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.001
Good luck everyone.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.923
Hmm, I adore your perfume.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.771
I'm not wearing any.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.961
It must be hard raising a child alone.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.360
I do what I can.

33:59.120 --> 34:03.682
You must find it hard being
so far from your husband and children.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.491
It isn't painful unless it's mentioned.

34:08.760 --> 34:12.367
That's a beautiful dress
wrapped round a lovely creature.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.411
Why, thank you!

34:18.120 --> 34:20.248
The king wants us to negotiate.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.130
- And you shall.
- We negotiate publicly?

34:24.000 --> 34:27.482
- You'd have everyone sent away?
- If that's what it takes.

34:29.480 --> 34:32.085
- You have a woman?
- My wife lives in Paris.

34:32.239 --> 34:34.641
- With you?
- I live with the king.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.289
- I'm confused.
- I sleep where the king sleeps.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.362
This is as far as I go.

34:44.639 --> 34:46.369
His bed must be crowded!

35:06.800 --> 35:09.326
We're not wanted here.
We should retire.

35:14.080 --> 35:15.080
Brother,

35:15.880 --> 35:18.008
negotiations have just begun.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.482
Please don't toy with him this way.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.041
I think I understand this game.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.363
Apparently so!

36:28.320 --> 36:32.644
Alas, fortune at this table
doesn't favour us tonight.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.802
So, let's play.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.685
What are you doing?

36:50.840 --> 36:51.840
Winning!

36:53.440 --> 36:55.169
There's a spring in your step.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.049
And worried faces in front.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.489
Your Majesty,
urgent business needs attention now.

37:01.640 --> 37:04.803
I hope this new success
brings you quickly to bed.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.326
Cassel's replied to the message, Sire.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.201
"Here's your proof:"

37:21.960 --> 37:24.281
"a contribution to your noble project."

37:27.640 --> 37:29.483
May I reply in person, Sire?

37:29.640 --> 37:31.927
- I urge restraint.
- Facing insolence?

37:32.480 --> 37:33.766
If I may, Sire?

37:33.920 --> 37:36.969
Arresting him
will end your plan before it starts.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.851
We may as well imprison all the nobles,

37:40.000 --> 37:41.490
that's what'd happen.

37:42.360 --> 37:46.410
Let me bruise his face
for the insult he's given you.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.882
Cut off one head,
and another will replace it.

37:50.040 --> 37:52.520
To touch him is to beg for civil war,

37:52.680 --> 37:54.489
as the English found out.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.250
Husband, I'm not ready.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.970
I'm not here in duty, but in gratitude,

38:06.160 --> 38:10.529
for keeping your word,
and showing hospitality to our guest.

38:12.320 --> 38:15.688
You did it very well,
and for that I'm grateful.

38:37.440 --> 38:41.001
- I wish to bestow a gift upon you.
- I accept!

38:42.440 --> 38:44.124
The gift is a secret.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.726
So much the better.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.204
- Your daughter is alive.
- Oh!

39:29.560 --> 39:32.962
Brother, wake up!
The king wants to see you.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.686
Tell him to wait.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.565
Tell him for yourself.

39:41.160 --> 39:44.130
Please get dressed.
We don't have much time.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.647
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

39:52.600 --> 39:57.083
Sire,
the Parthenays will arrive this morning.

39:57.240 --> 40:00.084
- And my goddaughter Charlotte?
- Yes, Sire.

40:01.040 --> 40:02.690
A ray of sunshine.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.124
Are we nearly there, Maman?

40:25.000 --> 40:26.286
You stay here.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.724
How did you enjoy my wine?

41:12.800 --> 41:14.165
What's your offer?

41:17.000 --> 41:19.606
The Dutch
don't have your hospitality,

41:20.960 --> 41:21.960
but there's money.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.211
Where are we?

41:38.360 --> 41:39.691
A brief stop.

41:57.480 --> 41:59.403
My gardener found this man,

42:01.680 --> 42:05.241
a noble who fought
against my family in the uprising.

42:07.920 --> 42:12.091
He thought he was safe
out in the woods.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.484
Oh, my God!

43:07.640 --> 43:10.564
Your valuables, if you so please.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.608
I know that voice! Montcourt!

43:24.760 --> 43:27.331
Don't! Please, don't!

43:32.560 --> 43:35.086
- Kill her!
- Oh, I will.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.525
Hey, we have to move!

44:51.560 --> 44:52.560
Hurry!

44:53.000 --> 44:54.525
- Near dark.
- She's gone.

44:54.680 --> 44:56.762
She'll die! Let's go!

45:21.920 --> 45:23.251
Why are we here?

45:30.160 --> 45:32.845
The Dutch do have money, but no power.

45:33.960 --> 45:35.325
We have both.

45:42.960 --> 45:45.406
- Why am I here?
- To finish negotiating.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.211
We haven't started yet.

45:47.560 --> 45:51.326
We've been negotiating
since you stepped off your coach.

45:57.120 --> 45:58.360
I've no choice.

45:58.520 --> 46:01.205
I offer security and a fair revenue.

46:02.080 --> 46:04.731
Also a gunboat to secure your port.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.651
You've been away awhile,

46:07.080 --> 46:09.003
enemies are moving against you.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.321
Father'll handle it.

46:14.880 --> 46:17.247
Do you see this loud little life?

46:19.360 --> 46:23.445
I'm told that God himself
brought her to me for a reason.

46:25.040 --> 46:26.166
Now I understand.

46:30.240 --> 46:32.322
Her very existence begs a question,

46:32.480 --> 46:36.644
because in any other country,
England, Spain, the Dutch republics,

46:36.800 --> 46:39.883
she'd be long dead, and her mother too.

46:41.480 --> 46:45.007
Yet here she is, and here you are.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.491
One thing is sure.

46:47.640 --> 46:50.291
Maybe you'll make a deal elsewhere.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.841
Rest assured, they'll smile, agree,

46:53.280 --> 46:57.729
then they'll bring armies,
burn your land, kill your families...

46:57.880 --> 47:01.089
and take
what's dear to you. Certain!

47:01.240 --> 47:03.004
- So would you.
- Not I.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.801
I suggest you decide quickly.

47:05.960 --> 47:08.486
With no king,
a country plunges into war.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.080
King?

47:15.000 --> 47:16.684
Your father is dead.

47:17.960 --> 47:18.960
You're king.

47:23.480 --> 47:25.642
My condolences, Your Majesty.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.326
Majesty'?

47:55.840 --> 47:58.605
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

48:38.880 --> 48:39.961
We're going.

49:13.960 --> 49:18.045
The Venetians have
worked hard on a new glass, Sire.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.091
They hope it'll be more to your liking.

49:32.480 --> 49:33.606
Better.

49:52.240 --> 49:53.240
Burn him.

49:54.305 --> 50:00.856
