<i>My name is Chris Norton.</i>

00:32.218 --> 00:34.785
<i>And I'm
a documentary filmmaker.</i>

00:34.787 --> 00:38.689
<i>I shot my first film,
if you can call it that,</i>

00:38.691 --> 00:40.523
<i>on my 7th birthday.</i>

00:54.706 --> 00:57.540
Stop it!
Shut up!

00:57.542 --> 01:01.177
And you go
and watch some TV.

01:01.179 --> 01:03.514
Go to your room.

01:04.581 --> 01:07.986
<i>I remember it well
'cause it was my birthday.</i>

01:13.857 --> 01:17.293
I said, "Watch some TV"!

01:17.295 --> 01:19.228
Hey, Nell!

01:19.230 --> 01:21.163
Come back.

01:21.165 --> 01:23.799
Stop what you're doing.

01:23.801 --> 01:26.234
Nell, come back!

01:26.236 --> 01:28.303
Ah, very nice.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.538
Nell!

01:30.540 --> 01:32.673
Nell!

01:32.675 --> 01:34.209
Hey, Nell!

01:34.211 --> 01:36.546
Chris.
Go on, keep back.

01:41.285 --> 01:44.020
It was just a power surge.

01:44.988 --> 01:46.854
But it was enough for my father
to take the act

01:46.856 --> 01:50.057
of a desperate woman and turn it
into another of his obsessions.

01:50.059 --> 01:51.559
That night, he became convinced

01:51.561 --> 01:54.630
that my mother
was abducted by aliens.

01:55.164 --> 01:57.834
My father died two weeks ago...

01:58.600 --> 02:01.168
...never giving up
on that belief.

02:01.170 --> 02:03.170
So I decided to make this film.

02:03.172 --> 02:05.705
To disprove one of the greatest
myths of this century.

02:05.707 --> 02:07.774
The one
that destroyed my family.

02:07.776 --> 02:09.976
The alien abduction phenomenon.

02:28.897 --> 02:31.031
<i>Meet Kyle,
our grip and local guide.</i>

02:31.033 --> 02:32.165
Hey, hey.
How it's going?

02:32.167 --> 02:34.867
- How you doing?
- Good.

02:34.869 --> 02:36.602
- Kyle Blackburn.
- Chris Norman.

02:36.604 --> 02:38.070
Yeah, nice to meet you.
I'm Brent.

02:38.072 --> 02:40.239
The convention's over here.

02:40.241 --> 02:43.609
- Bill, this is Chris Norton.
- Chris.

02:43.611 --> 02:44.910
- Hey.
- Bill Johnson.

02:44.912 --> 02:47.346
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, great to meet you.

02:47.348 --> 02:48.947
- This is Brent.
- Oh, hey, there, Brent.

02:48.949 --> 02:52.051
Welcome to
the International UFO Congress.

02:52.053 --> 02:54.253
Have you ever been
to this conference before?

02:54.255 --> 02:55.720
I don't believe so.

02:55.722 --> 02:57.156
Well, then let me
show you around.

02:57.158 --> 02:59.224
- Right.
- You okay there, Brent?

02:59.226 --> 03:00.691
- Get my good side.
- He's just gonna be

03:00.693 --> 03:02.327
- following us. Thank you.
- All righty.

03:02.329 --> 03:04.929
I built this convention
from the ground up

03:04.931 --> 03:07.632
when Roswell was nothing more
than a joke.

03:07.634 --> 03:11.636
Now we attract world-renowned
experts, and our town thrives.

03:11.638 --> 03:13.871
We have over 100 exhibitors
this year,

03:13.873 --> 03:17.809
and somewhere between,
oh, 5,000 and 10,000 guests

03:17.811 --> 03:19.743
will pass through the doors.

03:19.745 --> 03:23.014
Hm. So, you're a skeptic,
Mr. Norton?

03:23.016 --> 03:24.315
Oh, what makes you say that?

03:24.317 --> 03:26.384
Oh, I can always spot
a non-believer.

03:26.386 --> 03:29.052
Well, I'm a reporter at heart,

03:29.054 --> 03:30.954
so I like to let the evidence
guide my opinion.

03:30.956 --> 03:33.424
Well, there certainly is
plenty of evidence here.

03:33.426 --> 03:36.193
I think you'll find it
quite compelling.

03:36.195 --> 03:37.661
I sure hope so.

03:37.663 --> 03:39.729
I'm just curious
about these sculptures.

03:39.731 --> 03:43.800
And which ones are the ones
that allegedly abduct humans?

03:43.802 --> 03:46.403
Well, you mind
if I give a little test to you?

03:46.405 --> 03:47.404
- Sure.
- I'm just curious.

03:47.406 --> 03:49.672
Let me have you hold this.

03:49.674 --> 03:51.141
And I just want you to tell me

03:51.143 --> 03:55.079
if you feel anything whatsoever
when you hold it.

03:56.381 --> 04:00.816
I feel like
I'm holding a black...

04:00.818 --> 04:03.621
...sculpture.

04:04.889 --> 04:07.256
Oh. Whoa.
My hand just started tingling.

04:07.258 --> 04:11.961
In the future, perhaps
you may have an experience.

04:11.963 --> 04:16.930
But regardless of what happens,
you need to be open-minded

04:16.933 --> 04:19.301
and be in your heart.

04:19.303 --> 04:22.070
I know it's hard for you
to believe this stuff,

04:22.072 --> 04:27.075
but as long as you keep
pushing away any possibilities,

04:27.077 --> 04:28.910
you're limiting yourself.

04:28.912 --> 04:30.712
You don't want to do that.

04:30.714 --> 04:33.948
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you my card.

04:33.950 --> 04:35.952
Just give me a call.

04:36.786 --> 04:39.854
You're gonna have contact.

04:47.763 --> 04:49.965
And then they grabbed
her photograph...

04:50.500 --> 04:52.099
It's hard to remember much.

04:52.101 --> 04:55.302
There was a bright light,
and then two hours later,

04:55.304 --> 04:58.140
I was still just... there.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.176
Like nothing happened.

05:01.410 --> 05:04.211
Yeah, I understand that's
fairly common... the light.

05:04.213 --> 05:06.382
It seemed to affect
my ability to move.

05:07.449 --> 05:09.916
Yeah.
And my memories...

05:09.918 --> 05:12.885
It did something
with my memories.

05:12.887 --> 05:16.456
Okay, so, considering that,
is it possible for you

05:16.458 --> 05:18.826
to even remember anything
from the actual abduction?

05:20.161 --> 05:21.463
It was like a nightmare.

05:22.764 --> 05:25.798
It was cold,
and that light, it...

05:25.800 --> 05:29.902
There was light everywhere, but
not like it came from anywhere.

05:29.904 --> 05:31.906
I was strapped to a table.

05:33.908 --> 05:35.408
And they...

05:35.410 --> 05:36.977
they did things.

05:51.325 --> 05:53.260
Adam.

05:54.895 --> 05:56.361
Are you familiar
with the phenomenon

05:56.363 --> 05:59.197
- known as false memory syndrome?
- You think I made it up?

05:59.199 --> 06:01.066
No. I don't think
you made it up intentionally.

06:01.068 --> 06:03.201
But it is a self-defense
mechanism of the mind.

06:03.203 --> 06:04.969
I know what I saw!

06:04.971 --> 06:07.472
Okay, I remember
when they took me.

06:07.474 --> 06:09.274
- I remember it.
- Okay.

06:09.276 --> 06:11.409
Well, you said it yourself...
It was like a nightmare.

06:11.411 --> 06:12.778
Maybe it was
an actual nightmare.

06:14.013 --> 06:15.580
Leave me alone!
You're just trying to hurt me

06:15.582 --> 06:17.414
- like the rest of them.
- I'm not trying to hurt you.

06:17.416 --> 06:19.483
No, you're just trying to hurt
me just like all of them.

06:19.485 --> 06:21.485
Okay, look.
Listen.

06:21.487 --> 06:23.387
You've got to be willing
to face the truth

06:23.389 --> 06:25.189
- if you're ever gonna get free.
- No! Leave me alone!

06:25.191 --> 06:27.057
You're just like all of them,
okay?

06:27.059 --> 06:28.825
- Whoa! Hey! Hey!
- Adam.

06:28.827 --> 06:30.527
What the hell are you doing?
Hey!

06:30.529 --> 06:32.829
This is <i>my</i> interview.
Get the hell out of here.

06:32.831 --> 06:34.498
- I know what I saw.
- It's okay. Come on.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.233
- I know what I saw.
- What the hell are you doing?!

06:37.235 --> 06:39.102
What are <i>you</i> doing?
I'm trying to help him out.

06:39.104 --> 06:40.504
He's got to be willing
to confront the truth.

06:40.506 --> 06:42.338
The "truth" is none
of your goddamn business!

06:42.340 --> 06:44.941
- But it's yours?
- Yes! This is my friend!

06:44.943 --> 06:47.176
Who are you to determine
what the truth is for anyone?

06:47.178 --> 06:49.078
I'm just trying to let him know
and you

06:49.080 --> 06:50.179
that the truth
is not an opinion.

06:50.181 --> 06:51.581
It's a verifiable fact.

06:51.583 --> 06:54.284
Okay. Well, then verify this.
Go fuck yourself.

06:54.286 --> 06:57.220
Come on.

06:57.222 --> 06:59.921
Hey. Get over here.

06:59.923 --> 07:02.090
Now we got to find
somebody else to interview.

07:02.092 --> 07:04.059
What the hell
was going on in here?

07:04.061 --> 07:05.461
I was doing an interview,

07:05.463 --> 07:06.895
and he starts freaking out.

07:06.897 --> 07:08.531
I'm just asking him
simple questions.

07:08.533 --> 07:10.232
Turn that off, please.

07:10.234 --> 07:13.435
I can't have any of this.
I can't have it. Okay?

07:13.437 --> 07:15.003
You just need
to pack up your stuff,

07:15.005 --> 07:17.506
and you need to get out of here
right now.

07:17.508 --> 07:18.607
Just go.

07:18.609 --> 07:20.442
Everything's okay, folks.

07:20.444 --> 07:22.277
It's all right.
Tell him it's okay.

07:22.279 --> 07:25.079
He can start up again.
Everything's good here.

07:25.081 --> 07:28.550
We're all good.
Sorry.

07:28.552 --> 07:30.217
Hey, who's that girl
that just came in?

07:30.219 --> 07:32.086
Emily?
She's a local girl.

07:32.088 --> 07:35.458
- Emily Reed.
- Emily Reed.

07:40.029 --> 07:42.363
<i>Maybe I was too harsh.
I don't know.</i>

07:42.365 --> 07:45.533
<i>But I felt like I at least had
to explain myself to Emily.</i>

07:45.535 --> 07:48.302
<i>Kyle found out she organizes
some of community gathering</i>

07:48.304 --> 07:50.438
<i>just outside of town.</i>

07:50.440 --> 07:52.239
<i>That's what I love
about documentaries...</i>

07:52.241 --> 07:55.345
<i>You never know where
the story's gonna take you.</i>

07:58.013 --> 08:00.046
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hmm?

08:00.048 --> 08:02.918
We're going live on this one.

08:04.953 --> 08:06.955
You're the boss.

08:07.489 --> 08:09.322
Go, go, go, go.

08:09.324 --> 08:14.127
It's not knowing
the truth that hurts... the most.

08:14.129 --> 08:17.430
Sorry to interrupt.
We're with Emily.

08:17.432 --> 08:20.369
These guys with you?

08:26.140 --> 08:28.575
Agnes, it's okay.
Go on.

08:28.577 --> 08:31.176
I just

08:31.178 --> 08:37.049
I feel like if I just knew
what they wanted with me...

08:37.051 --> 08:40.219
what it is
they were trying to do, then...

08:40.221 --> 08:43.090
everything would be okay.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.704
Hi. My name is Emily Reed.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.205
Hi, Emily.

09:01.207 --> 09:07.178
I was abducted the first time
on my 7th birthday.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.413
Did she just say "abducted"?

09:08.415 --> 09:09.747
Did she say "the first time"?

09:09.749 --> 09:14.219
The second time
was the day I turned 14.

09:15.688 --> 09:20.660
And then, seven years later,
they came for me again.

09:22.127 --> 09:26.196
It doesn't matter where I hide
or what I do.

09:26.198 --> 09:28.500
They always find me.

09:29.568 --> 09:33.203
And like all of you,
what I want more than anything

09:33.205 --> 09:36.542
is to know why.

09:39.211 --> 09:41.611
Bye, guys.
Thank you again.

09:41.613 --> 09:43.647
Thank you.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.347
Thank you for coming.

09:45.349 --> 09:47.049
Thank you.

09:47.051 --> 09:48.585
Bye, Mike.

09:48.587 --> 09:51.355
- Good deal. See you next week.
- All right.

09:53.591 --> 09:55.558
Is that dude your boyfriend?

09:55.560 --> 09:58.127
'Cause he looked at me like he
wants to punch me in the face.

09:58.129 --> 10:00.463
- So do I.
- Okay. Hold on.

10:00.465 --> 10:03.732
Hold on. Let me explain.
I was not trying to hurt Adam.

10:03.734 --> 10:06.034
- I was trying to help him.
- Help him?

10:06.036 --> 10:08.804
By telling someone who's in pain
that they're making it up?

10:08.806 --> 10:10.806
I was merely suggesting to him
that maybe what he thinks

10:10.808 --> 10:12.641
- is real isn't.
- What if there are

10:12.643 --> 10:13.776
- different versions of reality?
- You can't have

10:13.778 --> 10:15.343
different versions of reality.

10:15.345 --> 10:17.278
- Reality is not an opinion.
- Sure, it is.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.616
And it's my opinion
that you're an asshole.

10:22.252 --> 10:25.153
There have been studies...
And that's not an opinion.

10:25.155 --> 10:26.654
- There have been studies...
- Studies.

10:26.656 --> 10:29.123
Studies. You know...
the scientific things?

10:29.125 --> 10:31.292
Which prove that in order
for healing to take place,

10:31.294 --> 10:32.827
people have to be willing
to confront the truth.

10:32.829 --> 10:34.529
Okay, you know what?

10:34.531 --> 10:37.233
- Let me ask you something.
- Shoot.

10:39.435 --> 10:41.201
What do you see?

10:41.203 --> 10:45.072
I see an arrowhead
at the end of a necklace.

10:45.074 --> 10:46.808
What do <i>you</i> see?

10:46.810 --> 10:50.410
I see a stone that was formed
millions of years ago

10:50.412 --> 10:53.247
and a weapon that was made
by an ancient civilization

10:53.249 --> 10:56.717
and a piece of jewelry that I've
had since before I can remember.

10:56.719 --> 11:00.654
Now, the "truth"
is it's billions of atoms

11:00.656 --> 11:02.456
made of up trillions of protons,

11:02.458 --> 11:05.191
held together
by zillions of electrons.

11:05.193 --> 11:07.295
But that doesn't make any
of the other things less true.

11:10.331 --> 11:12.298
I don't think
zillions is a real number.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.533
Sure, it is.

11:13.535 --> 11:16.371
It's just
this side of a googolplex.

11:18.606 --> 11:22.875
Look, no one here
actually knows "the truth."

11:22.877 --> 11:26.312
All I know for sure is that...

11:26.314 --> 11:27.680
something's been happening
to me.

11:27.682 --> 11:29.582
- My whole life.
- I believe you.

11:29.584 --> 11:32.317
But what evidence, what actual,
hard, empirical evidence

11:32.319 --> 11:33.819
do you have
that these experiences have been

11:33.821 --> 11:36.656
alien abductions and not
some other kind of phenomenon?

11:36.658 --> 11:38.659
Well, maybe you can see
for yourself.

11:40.727 --> 11:44.396
Sunday is my 28th birthday.

11:44.398 --> 11:47.699
Seven years to the day since
the last time that I was taken.

11:49.870 --> 11:53.738
Nice work, Brent.
So much for your hidden camera.

11:53.740 --> 11:54.906
Signing off.

12:02.515 --> 12:04.248
Do you think she's real?

12:04.250 --> 12:06.885
I don't know. I mean,
she doesn't seem delusional.

12:06.887 --> 12:09.687
I mean, the repeated pattern of
abductions is a little strange.

12:09.689 --> 12:12.458
That's definitely not usual.

12:13.492 --> 12:15.826
Well, maybe
she just hates birthdays.

12:15.828 --> 12:17.728
Kind of like you

12:17.730 --> 12:19.396
a couple years ago, but
I guess you wouldn't remember,

12:19.398 --> 12:21.565
'cause you ended up passed out
in the gutter.

12:21.567 --> 12:23.701
You know I don't like birthdays,
and you know why.

12:23.703 --> 12:25.103
'Cause they remind me of my mom.

12:26.237 --> 12:27.805
Emily's not like that,
though, man. I'm telling you.

12:27.807 --> 12:29.709
She's displaying symptoms
of FMS.

12:35.747 --> 12:37.380
Oh, shit.

12:37.382 --> 12:38.648
- Do you see that?
- Huh?

12:38.650 --> 12:39.882
Look, look, look!

12:39.884 --> 12:41.384
- Right there. White light.
- Where?

12:41.386 --> 12:42.952
White light. Right there.
Get the camera.

12:42.954 --> 12:45.187
How am I gonna get the camera?
I'll get the camera.

12:45.189 --> 12:46.656
It's getting closer.

12:46.658 --> 12:48.825
- Wow. Wow.
- You know what?

12:48.827 --> 12:51.226
That's the problem
with all this bullshit.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.862
You start thinking about it
so much,

12:52.864 --> 12:55.330
and then next thing you know,
your imagination is going crazy.

12:55.332 --> 12:57.532
Is that an alien campground?

12:57.534 --> 12:59.768
Oh! Shit!

13:03.741 --> 13:06.375
- Oh!
- Shit, man!

13:06.377 --> 13:08.677
What the hell, dude?!
This is why you never drive.

13:08.679 --> 13:10.679
- I just hit something.
- What do you mean?

13:10.681 --> 13:13.482
- Like an animal?
- It wasn't an animal, man.

13:13.484 --> 13:15.316
Something else.
I don't...

13:15.318 --> 13:17.452
You're not going out there?

13:17.454 --> 13:19.453
Yeah. How else
are we gonna know what you hit?

13:19.455 --> 13:20.789
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

13:20.791 --> 13:23.224
- You're crazy.
- Yeah, I'm crazy.

13:23.226 --> 13:25.259
Don't do it!

13:46.515 --> 13:49.184
Well, I'll be damned.

13:59.961 --> 14:02.898
Aah!

14:04.900 --> 14:06.666
Hey.

14:06.668 --> 14:08.302
You gotta come check this out.

14:16.778 --> 14:18.812
Look at this.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.880
Whoa.

14:20.882 --> 14:22.381
Oh.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.819
I guess you did hit something.

14:27.988 --> 14:31.459
- All right. Well...
- It's in the bush, too.

14:34.795 --> 14:36.061
Oh, it goes this way.

14:36.063 --> 14:37.896
We can get in the car now.

14:37.898 --> 14:40.498
Oh, there's more.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.633
Dude, check it out.
See the blood?

14:42.635 --> 14:45.838
I told you, man.
It wasn't my imagination.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.507
There's something out there.

15:05.925 --> 15:08.558
Oh, oh! Oh! Oh, shit!

15:08.560 --> 15:10.462
Oh, shit!

15:11.497 --> 15:12.729
- Oh, my...
- It's just a pig.

15:12.731 --> 15:14.065
- Huh?
- You thought we found E.T.,

15:14.067 --> 15:16.533
- didn't you? Huh?
- I just shit my pants.

15:16.535 --> 15:17.801
Move! Watch it!

15:17.803 --> 15:20.370
Oh, my God.
Behind you.

15:20.372 --> 15:22.372
- Chris!
- What?

15:22.374 --> 15:23.807
Dude, what the hell
are you doing?

15:23.809 --> 15:25.542
Hey!

15:25.544 --> 15:28.344
- Get out of here!
- Hey!

15:28.346 --> 15:29.913
- It's just a pig.
- Let's go, let's go,

15:29.915 --> 15:32.015
let's go, let's go!
There's something out there!

15:32.017 --> 15:33.482
Let's go!
Come on!

15:33.484 --> 15:34.684
What the hell is wrong with you?

15:34.686 --> 15:36.787
There's nothing out there.

15:36.789 --> 15:38.754
Please, please, please.

15:38.756 --> 15:40.924
We got to go.

15:40.926 --> 15:42.527
Shit, buddy.

15:44.896 --> 15:47.396
- <i>Oh, my...</i>
- <i>It's just a pig.</i>

15:47.398 --> 15:49.865
Brent did film something.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.600
He was convinced
that it looked like

15:51.602 --> 15:53.771
this little black alien statue
we saw at the convention.

15:58.441 --> 15:59.675
Just give me a call.

16:04.614 --> 16:06.714
Ooh.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.583
Huh.

16:08.585 --> 16:10.485
Is this
what they were talking about?

16:13.557 --> 16:15.456
- We are looking for...
- Hello?

16:18.595 --> 16:20.931
You hear something back there?

16:22.899 --> 16:25.432
- Hello?
- Lose something?

16:25.434 --> 16:29.971
What can I do for you,
my young, very good-looking man?

16:29.973 --> 16:33.540
Well, it seems that we met
an associate of yours

16:33.542 --> 16:35.711
last night at the convention.

16:36.445 --> 16:39.446
Yeah, that would be
my half sister, Hicktyn.

16:39.448 --> 16:44.418
You probably noticed she's, mm,
not quite all there.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.388
That's because, uh, my stepdad
is from...

16:49.158 --> 16:51.658
- Uh...
- Joke.

16:51.660 --> 16:53.994
- Oh.
- Oh.

16:53.996 --> 16:55.729
Anyway, we got a few questions
for you

16:55.731 --> 16:59.465
about a sculpture
that Hicktyn mentioned.

16:59.467 --> 17:00.633
Uh-huh?

17:00.635 --> 17:01.934
A guy in a black cloak?

17:01.936 --> 17:03.805
Yeah.

17:07.075 --> 17:08.840
This is the one.

17:08.843 --> 17:10.910
That's it.
It's the one... that I saw.

17:10.912 --> 17:13.512
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I saw the footage.

17:13.513 --> 17:16.848
It's one of the more common
sightings in these parts.

17:16.851 --> 17:20.621
Really? So, you're saying that
this is an extraterrestrial?

17:21.622 --> 17:24.724
Absolutely.

17:25.592 --> 17:28.526
You know

17:28.528 --> 17:30.862
we get our fair share
of non-believers,

17:30.864 --> 17:33.899
come to disprove this or that.

17:33.901 --> 17:37.871
But sooner or later,
if they stay long enough...

17:38.739 --> 17:40.941
...they come
to realize the truth.

17:42.175 --> 17:45.012
Hmm.

17:45.712 --> 17:46.811
You come with me.

17:46.813 --> 17:49.950
I want to show you something.

17:53.886 --> 17:56.189
Come on, then.

17:57.823 --> 18:01.792
This is where I keep
the real important stuff.

18:01.794 --> 18:03.694
Who's that?

18:03.696 --> 18:05.796
Oh, that's my husband, Ed.

18:05.798 --> 18:07.533
Just ignore him.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.870
This...

18:11.569 --> 18:13.569
...is an interesting specimen.

18:13.571 --> 18:14.941
What the hell is that?

18:15.775 --> 18:18.608
It's a memory-stealing device.

18:18.610 --> 18:21.511
Or at least
that's what we think.

18:21.513 --> 18:25.581
Most victims experience
blackouts and losses of memory

18:25.583 --> 18:26.883
during abduction.

18:26.885 --> 18:30.153
Sometimes, after they return,

18:30.155 --> 18:34.057
whole chunks of memories
are just... missing.

18:34.059 --> 18:36.561
Can I take a closer look
at that, please?

18:39.898 --> 18:42.531
You know, I had it analyzed.

18:42.533 --> 18:44.768
They can't identify
the materials.

18:45.636 --> 18:47.203
How much do you want for it?

18:47.205 --> 18:49.272
It's not for sale.
It's not even mine.

18:49.274 --> 18:51.274
How'd you get it, then?
Whose is it?

18:51.276 --> 18:52.841
I got it from the same person

18:52.843 --> 18:55.913
that described
the black-cloaked figure.

18:57.614 --> 19:00.048
A local girl.

19:00.050 --> 19:02.485
Her name's Emily.

19:03.721 --> 19:05.823
- Emily Reed.
- Emily Reed.

19:10.094 --> 19:11.494
Okay, this is her place.

19:12.029 --> 19:13.661
She's probably in her studio
right now.

19:13.663 --> 19:15.297
That's the patio 'round back.

19:15.299 --> 19:17.232
You know, guys, probably not
gonna be too happy to see us.

19:17.234 --> 19:19.635
But when has
that ever stopped me?

19:25.742 --> 19:27.643
Hello?

19:29.912 --> 19:32.913
Emily, I just don't want
to see you get hurt. That's all.

19:32.915 --> 19:35.615
I mean,
look what he did to Adam.

19:35.617 --> 19:37.051
- He's clearly not one of us.
- Hey.

19:37.053 --> 19:39.788
- We got to be careful.
- Hey.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.590
What are you doing here?

19:43.592 --> 19:46.227
Ah, I could ask you
the same thing there, cowboy.

19:46.229 --> 19:49.229
Will you kindly turn
the camera off, please?

19:49.231 --> 19:50.663
Why don't you just
pack up your stuff

19:50.665 --> 19:53.166
and just head on back home?

19:53.168 --> 19:54.634
She doesn't want to talk to you.

19:54.636 --> 19:56.836
- It's okay, Bill.
- See?

19:56.838 --> 19:58.705
It's okay, Bill.

19:58.707 --> 20:00.206
Would do you know?

20:02.177 --> 20:04.944
I'd be on my best behavior,
if I were you.

20:04.946 --> 20:06.678
My patience is waning.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.216
Is that a threat?

20:09.351 --> 20:11.817
- Just a little friendly advice.
- Hm.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.205
What is all this?

20:33.207 --> 20:35.740
I sell art
at all the local shops in town.

20:35.742 --> 20:38.643
Those are most wonderful-looking
bicycle wheels I've ever seen.

20:38.645 --> 20:40.880
It's a dreamcatcher.

20:43.149 --> 20:44.816
It catches
all the good dreams...

20:44.818 --> 20:46.250
And gets rid
of all the bad ones.

20:46.252 --> 20:47.985
Right?

20:47.987 --> 20:49.387
How's that working out for you?

20:49.389 --> 20:52.689
What can I do
for you, Mr. Norton?

20:52.691 --> 20:56.194
Well, last night, on the way
home, we saw someone, driving.

20:56.196 --> 20:57.361
- Or something.
- Well,

20:57.363 --> 21:00.033
someone dressed like this.
Grab it.

21:05.771 --> 21:07.104
The lady from Seti Alpha 5

21:07.106 --> 21:09.975
said it was carved
from your description.

21:12.911 --> 21:14.880
It's not just mine.
There are others.

21:17.349 --> 21:20.417
Listen, Emily,
I'm not your enemy.

21:20.419 --> 21:22.921
Can you hand me those scissors
over there, please?

21:31.796 --> 21:33.631
For you.

21:34.699 --> 21:36.801
Scissors.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.308
When I was 7, my mom left home.

21:46.344 --> 21:49.844
On my birthday, actually.

21:49.846 --> 21:51.313
And until the day he died,

21:51.315 --> 21:53.317
my father believed
that she was abducted by aliens.

21:56.887 --> 21:58.320
But that was just a crazy story

21:58.322 --> 22:01.089
he made up in his head,
of course.

22:01.091 --> 22:03.858
Just another one
of his wild conspiracy theories.

22:03.860 --> 22:06.361
The truth is,
he was an obsessive drunk

22:06.363 --> 22:08.331
who drove her away.

22:09.065 --> 22:11.735
It's not the aliens' fault
she didn't come back. It's his.

22:12.903 --> 22:14.369
But no matter how hard I tried,

22:14.371 --> 22:16.471
no matter what I said,
no matter what I did, I...

22:16.473 --> 22:18.308
couldn't get him
to confront that truth.

22:21.777 --> 22:23.844
I don't understand
what you want from me.

22:23.846 --> 22:26.148
There's a technique
called regression hypnosis.

22:28.485 --> 22:30.217
A therapist
can help you remember

22:30.219 --> 22:32.052
what really happened to you,
what's still

22:32.054 --> 22:34.290
apparently happening to you.

22:36.192 --> 22:38.027
Okay.

23:12.460 --> 23:15.961
This is what regression therapy
did for me.

23:15.963 --> 23:17.363
<i>Very good, Emily.</i>

23:17.365 --> 23:20.298
<i>Now, free of any pain or upset,</i>

23:20.300 --> 23:22.535
<i>I want you to describe
what you see.</i>

23:22.537 --> 23:28.039
<i>The lights are very bright,
but it's...</i>

23:28.041 --> 23:31.109
<i>it's cold. Sterile.
Like a hospital.</i>

23:31.111 --> 23:34.047
<i>Is there anyone else there
with you?</i>

23:35.482 --> 23:37.983
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- <i>It's okay, Emily.</i>

23:37.985 --> 23:40.185
<i>The memory
is completely free of pain.</i>

23:40.187 --> 23:43.488
<i>Now, who else
is there with you?</i>

23:43.490 --> 23:45.390
<i>They're, uh...</i>

23:45.392 --> 23:46.959
<i>They're tall.</i>

23:48.060 --> 23:50.863
<i>Good. Good.
Go on.</i>

23:51.364 --> 23:53.964
<i>They're looking at me.</i>

23:53.966 --> 23:55.368
<i>They want something from me.</i>

23:57.403 --> 23:58.869
<i>What is it they want?</i>

24:01.507 --> 24:03.942
<i>I don't know.</i>

24:04.943 --> 24:07.311
- <i>I don't know what they want.</i>
- <i>You have to look deep, Emily.</i>

24:07.313 --> 24:09.546
<i>The memory is there.
You just have to dig deeper.</i>

24:09.548 --> 24:12.416
<i>I can't. No.</i>

24:12.418 --> 24:13.983
<i>I can't.</i>

24:13.985 --> 24:16.185
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>It's okay.</i>

24:16.187 --> 24:17.621
<i>They'll hurt me!</i>

24:17.623 --> 24:19.590
- <i>They'll hurt me!</i>
- <i>It's okay.</i>

24:19.592 --> 24:23.226
<i>They will!
They don't want me to remember!</i>

24:23.228 --> 24:25.463
<i>No! No!</i>

24:28.333 --> 24:31.167
I have plenty of sequels
just like that.

24:31.169 --> 24:34.272
You guys can do a marathon night
and watch them all, if you want.

24:44.048 --> 24:45.881
The lady from Seti Alpha 5

24:45.883 --> 24:49.551
has something
called a memory device.

24:49.553 --> 24:53.223
She said she got it from you.
Do you know anything about that?

24:54.024 --> 24:55.526
Yeah.

24:56.660 --> 24:58.893
I, um...

24:58.895 --> 25:02.464
I found it the last time
they brought me back.

25:02.466 --> 25:04.599
Okay.

25:04.601 --> 25:06.836
Found it where?

25:09.972 --> 25:11.542
Here.

25:40.535 --> 25:43.136
I'd like to get
that device analyzed.

25:43.138 --> 25:44.971
Do you think you can get it back
from Lucille?

25:44.973 --> 25:46.473
I don't think so.

25:46.475 --> 25:49.309
Brent and I can take it,
get it analyzed,

25:49.311 --> 25:50.911
- find out where it came from.
- I don't think so.

25:51.646 --> 25:53.179
I understand that,

25:53.181 --> 25:55.348
- but I think...
- I don't think you're listening!

25:55.350 --> 26:01.288
I don't want to, and I really
think you guys should leave.

26:05.493 --> 26:07.126
We got to get our hands
on that device.

26:07.128 --> 26:08.594
How?
You heard her.

26:08.596 --> 26:10.963
I don't know, but whatever's
going on with that girl,

26:10.965 --> 26:12.398
it has something to do
with that device.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.032
So, do you still not believe
in aliens?

26:14.034 --> 26:15.634
Of course I don't.
Why? Do you?

26:15.636 --> 26:17.636
I don't know. I saw that thing
on the back of her head.

26:17.638 --> 26:19.104
That's some weird freakin' shit.

26:19.106 --> 26:20.606
Yeah, no shit
it's weird freakin' shit.

26:20.608 --> 26:22.574
That's why we got to find out
what the hell it is.

26:22.576 --> 26:25.143
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Sure. Why wouldn't it be?

26:25.145 --> 26:27.345
He's just been sitting there,
waiting, since you went inside.

26:27.347 --> 26:28.948
- Who?
- Bill.

26:29.517 --> 26:31.282
- Why?
- I think he's worried

26:31.284 --> 26:32.718
- you're gonna hurt business.
- Oh, business?

26:32.720 --> 26:34.619
You mean preying
on peoples' fears for profit?

26:34.621 --> 26:36.754
I'm just saying.
We should be careful.

26:36.756 --> 26:38.222
Bill's a powerful guy
around here.

26:38.224 --> 26:40.057
What, are you saying
he's dangerous?

26:40.059 --> 26:42.593
We don't want any trouble from
him. That's what I'm saying.

26:42.595 --> 26:45.296
- There's rumors.
- What rumors?

26:45.298 --> 26:47.231
What kind of rumors?

26:47.233 --> 26:50.468
That he used to be some kind of
"contractor" for the military.

26:50.470 --> 26:52.570
Then, again,
they're just rumors, right?

26:52.572 --> 26:55.107
Yeah, just rumors.

26:59.578 --> 27:02.948
I'd only known Emily
for about 24 hours.

27:03.549 --> 27:07.083
Man, from the first moment
I saw her, I knew.

27:07.085 --> 27:08.953
I knew.

27:09.455 --> 27:11.288
I knew I had to help her
if I could.

27:11.290 --> 27:13.122
But how do you convince someone
that what they believe...

27:13.124 --> 27:16.994
I mean, really believe...
is untrue?

27:17.563 --> 27:19.531
Even worse...

27:20.264 --> 27:22.568
...what happens when you start
to believe it, too?

27:24.435 --> 27:26.268
All right,
to activate the low-light sensor

27:26.270 --> 27:28.537
- if it gets dark, right here.
- Okay.

27:28.539 --> 27:29.605
- Boom.
- All right. Got it.

27:29.607 --> 27:31.540
Tighten this up.
All right.

27:31.542 --> 27:33.542
- All right.
- Think we're ready?

27:33.544 --> 27:35.478
All right, you ready?
Huh?

27:35.480 --> 27:36.812
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Hey. Are you ready?

27:36.814 --> 27:39.113
- I'm ready, but...
- All right. Let's go.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.784
You really need me to go?
You really need me to go?

27:41.786 --> 27:43.319
There's no reason for both of us
to commit a felony.

27:43.321 --> 27:45.086
Don't be dramatic.
That thing's fake.

27:45.088 --> 27:46.522
And when we find out it's fake,
I might need the footage

27:46.524 --> 27:48.191
as evidence to prove it.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.633
I don't want to go to jail, man.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.368
Let's make this
a quick in and out.

28:00.370 --> 28:02.339
We're breaking and entering.

28:03.306 --> 28:07.210
Oh, man.
We're now committing a crime.

28:07.711 --> 28:09.178
Ah.

28:09.713 --> 28:12.112
Look at that.
Just trespassing.

28:12.114 --> 28:13.548
Okay.

28:13.550 --> 28:15.650
Just a little trespassing.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.551
That's not so bad.

28:27.796 --> 28:31.467
A doggy. Doggy.

28:41.242 --> 28:43.612
Check these out.

28:46.281 --> 28:49.215
- Dude, stop screwing around.
- They feel so real.

28:49.217 --> 28:51.517
You know you've been in L.A.
too long, then.

28:51.519 --> 28:53.686
Shit.

28:59.527 --> 29:02.595
It's all make-believe.

29:02.597 --> 29:04.764
Nothing here is real.

29:04.766 --> 29:08.101
- Would you shut up?
- What?

29:19.880 --> 29:23.448
All right.

29:23.450 --> 29:26.553
Go.

29:33.192 --> 29:35.662
Hey. Turn off the light.

29:40.934 --> 29:41.835
Sweet.

29:51.677 --> 29:54.478
What?
Did something...

29:54.480 --> 29:56.314
Shh.

29:57.917 --> 29:59.417
I don't know, man.

30:29.914 --> 30:31.716
That's it.

30:51.802 --> 30:55.639
- Oh! Dude!
- Who's there?

30:57.640 --> 30:59.674
- Don't move!
- Aah!

30:59.676 --> 31:02.311
Get out of my property,
you sons of bitches!

31:06.616 --> 31:09.483
Open, open!
Open, open, open!

31:09.485 --> 31:13.322
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

31:13.990 --> 31:15.925
Go! Go! Go!

31:16.959 --> 31:18.628
Go, go, go, go!

31:19.595 --> 31:22.462
- Come on! Get in!
- Go, go, go, go!

31:22.464 --> 31:24.332
And don't you ever come back!

31:28.503 --> 31:30.037
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

31:30.039 --> 31:33.506
Ohh! I just got shot
by an old man in the leg.

31:33.508 --> 31:35.008
You think that's funny?

31:35.010 --> 31:36.676
- That's funny to you?
- Yeah.

31:36.678 --> 31:38.311
It's not funny.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.779
You okay?

31:39.781 --> 31:41.514
Yeah.
It's just a little bird shot.

31:41.516 --> 31:42.849
Grazed the skin.

31:42.851 --> 31:44.383
Hurts like hell, though.

31:45.787 --> 31:47.352
Good work, good work.

31:47.354 --> 31:48.688
- Oh!
- Yeah!

31:48.690 --> 31:50.857
We've officially been shot at,
my friend.

31:50.859 --> 31:52.424
I'm gonna use that.

31:52.426 --> 31:54.493
That will get me laid.
I know it. I'm shot.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.328
- Have you ever been shot?
- I've never been shot.

31:56.330 --> 31:58.464
Whew!
Here, let me see that thing.

31:58.466 --> 32:00.666
- What thing?
- The thing I just got shot for.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.634
Let me see it.

32:02.636 --> 32:04.536
- Why?
- What do you mean, "why"?

32:04.538 --> 32:06.572
Because I want to see if it has
"Made in China" stamped on it.

32:06.574 --> 32:08.741
Let me see the frickin' thing.

32:08.743 --> 32:12.077
What the hell is it all about,
anyways?

32:12.079 --> 32:13.812
You got to see
this thing up close, man.

32:13.814 --> 32:16.014
- I did. I held it.
- No. You got to feel it.

32:16.016 --> 32:17.682
It's like nothing
I've ever felt before.

32:17.684 --> 32:19.684
You sound like you're describing
a woman right now.

32:19.686 --> 32:21.920
It feels more foreign than that.

32:21.922 --> 32:23.956
Oh! Ow!

32:23.958 --> 32:25.057
- What the hell?
- Oh!

32:29.863 --> 32:32.363
What the...
What the fuck was that?

32:32.365 --> 32:34.098
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

32:34.100 --> 32:37.769
It felt like electricity,
like, all through my hands.

32:37.771 --> 32:39.937
- What? From that?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:39.939 --> 32:42.106
I just rubbed it, and the
frigging thing electrocuted me.

32:42.108 --> 32:44.842
Okay, okay. Okay,
when we get back to the hotel,

32:44.844 --> 32:46.743
I'm gonna run it back
the cameras

32:46.745 --> 32:49.379
and just watch it in slo-mo, and
see what the hell just happened.

32:49.381 --> 32:51.581
The fuck was that?
Here, give it back now.

32:51.583 --> 32:53.652
Gladly.

33:12.838 --> 33:13.872
Come on.

33:15.040 --> 33:18.041
- You're killing me here.
- Just seeing if you're alive.

33:18.043 --> 33:19.708
Yeah, well...

33:19.710 --> 33:21.111
Where the hell you guys been?

33:21.113 --> 33:22.478
What do you mean?
What's wrong?

33:24.048 --> 33:25.948
Nothing.
I've been calling you for hours.

33:25.950 --> 33:27.583
What are you talking about?
We've been gone, like,

33:27.585 --> 33:29.118
what, less than an hour?

33:29.120 --> 33:30.786
- It's 3:00 a.m., man.
- What?

33:30.788 --> 33:32.054
- It's 3:00 a.m.
- What are you talking about?

33:32.056 --> 33:35.026
- You guy left at 11:00.
- What?

33:35.726 --> 33:38.459
- What the hell happened to him?
- He got his ass shot.

33:38.461 --> 33:39.995
- You okay?
- Crazy old guy.

33:39.997 --> 33:43.398
- It's a long story.
- How is it 3:00 in the morning?

33:43.400 --> 33:44.899
It can't be.

33:44.901 --> 33:46.568
I got some footage
you guys got to see.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.776
I'm gonna sync my cameras
with the GoPros in the car...

33:53.510 --> 33:55.879
...see what we got here.

34:01.617 --> 34:04.551
- <i>Is it bad?</i>
- <i>Aah! Aah!</i>

34:04.553 --> 34:05.820
<i>...want to see
if it's made in China.</i>

34:05.822 --> 34:07.688
- <i>See it? See it?</i>
- <i>Just give me...</i>

34:07.690 --> 34:10.456
<i>This thing, it's like...</i>

34:10.458 --> 34:12.126
<i>It's like nothing
I've ever felt before.</i>

34:12.128 --> 34:13.927
<i>You sound like you're
describing a woman right now.</i>

34:13.929 --> 34:15.795
<i>No. No, it's even
more foreign than that.</i>

34:15.797 --> 34:17.130
<i>Oh!</i>

34:17.132 --> 34:20.567
- What?
- You see that?

34:20.569 --> 34:21.835
Yeah, I saw that.

34:23.505 --> 34:26.005
Fried my camera.
Here it is.

34:26.007 --> 34:29.745
There's the flash. That was
the one I was telling you about.

34:34.449 --> 34:37.652
Wait. No, no, no. Hold on. Hold
on. Keep playing. There's more.

34:40.188 --> 34:41.121
Okay.

34:44.926 --> 34:47.027
The hell you guys looking at?

34:47.728 --> 34:50.996
What the fuck?

34:50.998 --> 34:53.598
I don't remember this.

34:53.600 --> 34:54.867
I mean, this doesn't make
any sense.

34:54.869 --> 34:56.501
We're just sitting there,
staring.

34:56.503 --> 34:59.138
Okay. Just, uh...

34:59.140 --> 35:02.707
- Did the engine just die?
- We're stopping the car.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.743
I never stopped the car.
I never pulled over.

35:08.081 --> 35:10.849
But I never stopped the car.
I never stopped driving.

35:10.851 --> 35:14.588
We were driving the whole time.
Right? I mean...

35:16.123 --> 35:18.256
The thing shocked you.
We're still driving.

35:18.258 --> 35:21.492
- I mean, what...
- Look at the time.

35:21.494 --> 35:25.696
Time just keeps moving,
but we're not going anywhere.

35:25.698 --> 35:27.232
We're just...

35:27.234 --> 35:28.866
Fast-forward.
Fast-forward.

35:28.868 --> 35:30.668
Same. It's the same.
It's the same.

35:30.670 --> 35:33.837
Okay, I'm...

35:33.839 --> 35:35.606
I'm freaked out now.
Come on.

35:35.608 --> 35:38.075
<i>Holy...</i>

35:38.077 --> 35:40.611
Oh, now, what? We're just
driving all of a sudden again?

35:40.613 --> 35:42.646
- This doesn't make any sense.
- I don't know.

35:42.648 --> 35:44.615
- I don't know what to say.
- It's impossible.

35:44.617 --> 35:47.153
It's literally impossible.

35:49.721 --> 35:51.855
<i>Two hours.</i>

35:51.857 --> 35:55.025
<i>We sat there for two hours.</i>

35:55.027 --> 35:56.826
<i>I set out to prove
that alien abductions</i>

35:56.828 --> 35:58.295
<i>were nothing more
than false memories</i>

35:58.297 --> 36:02.031
<i>created by fragile minds
to cover painful truths.</i>

36:02.033 --> 36:05.134
But that's the problem
with searching for the truth.

36:05.136 --> 36:06.569
Because if you're open
and honest

36:06.571 --> 36:07.937
and willing to follow
the evidence

36:07.939 --> 36:10.940
no matter where it takes you,
sometimes...

36:10.942 --> 36:13.945
the truth can be more painful
than the dream.

36:16.580 --> 36:18.814
And I know our viewers
are really interested

36:18.816 --> 36:21.317
because you claim
that you have some evidence.

36:21.319 --> 36:23.852
- Can you share that with us?
- I didn't know at the time,

36:23.854 --> 36:28.590
but my little kid, Chris, he...

36:28.592 --> 36:30.158
He filmed you and your wife?

36:30.160 --> 36:32.594
Yeah, he filmed it all.

36:32.596 --> 36:34.965
And that's the tape?
Can we see it?

36:40.704 --> 36:42.137
<i>It's about you!</i>

36:42.139 --> 36:43.271
<i>It's about you all the time!</i>

36:44.774 --> 36:47.075
<i>So, what's happening there?</i>

36:47.077 --> 36:51.146
Oh, that's me and my wife
having a little argument.

36:51.148 --> 36:54.249
<i>Too obsessed with my things
and my wife. You know.</i>

36:54.251 --> 36:56.884
So, there.
<i>Go to your room.</i>

36:56.886 --> 36:59.720
Fast-forward.
So, there.

36:59.722 --> 37:01.591
There.
Keep watching.

37:02.125 --> 37:04.091
<i>You see?
That's it.</i>

37:04.093 --> 37:05.826
<i>There it is.</i>

37:05.828 --> 37:07.594
That's the light.
Can you see it?

37:07.596 --> 37:08.996
Up there.

37:08.998 --> 37:12.199
Becoming stronger and stronger,
and then...

37:12.201 --> 37:13.968
And, Peter, you...

37:13.970 --> 37:16.736
<i>So, you believe
that Nell was abducted?</i>

37:16.738 --> 37:19.005
<i>Maybe we</i> all <i>were abducted.</i>

37:19.007 --> 37:21.210
And they forgot to put her back.

37:23.779 --> 37:26.212
Yeah, I was gone, as I said,
for a couple of hours.

37:26.214 --> 37:29.618
Then, when I came back,
it's like...

37:31.386 --> 37:33.853
<i>...strange.</i>

37:33.855 --> 37:37.225
<i>To be gone
for two, three hours.</i>

37:38.060 --> 37:41.196
I've watched the video
a thousand times.

37:42.897 --> 37:45.331
Every single time
from the same perspective.

37:45.333 --> 37:46.965
But then, last night,
something happened to us

37:46.967 --> 37:49.001
when we were driving home.
There was a power surge.

37:49.003 --> 37:51.170
The power in the car went out,
but the cameras kept rolling.

37:51.172 --> 37:54.039
The cameras caught us sitting
in a trance for two hours.

37:54.041 --> 37:56.141
And we don't remember shit.

37:56.143 --> 37:58.277
And then I happened to think.
My dad said the same thing.

37:58.279 --> 37:59.812
He said that,
after the power surge,

37:59.814 --> 38:02.049
he blacked out
for several hours.

38:03.750 --> 38:06.952
As much as I don't like it,
I can't ignore the similarity.

38:06.954 --> 38:08.753
I have to know
what happened last night,

38:08.755 --> 38:10.688
and I have to know
what happened to him.

38:10.690 --> 38:12.757
I already know what happened.

38:12.759 --> 38:14.359
All you know is that
somebody attached this device

38:14.361 --> 38:16.727
- to the back of your head.
- Where did you get that?

38:16.729 --> 38:19.130
Is that why the sheriff's
been calling me?

38:19.132 --> 38:21.199
I told you...
I don't want any part of this!

38:21.201 --> 38:22.800
Don't you want to know
what it is?

38:22.802 --> 38:24.735
- Don't you want to know why?
- You know what?

38:24.737 --> 38:26.904
Unless you find some way
to communicate with "them,"

38:26.906 --> 38:28.439
- you can't find out why.
- Oh!

38:28.441 --> 38:30.241
You'd just rather have
your head in the sand?

38:30.243 --> 38:31.211
I want to know!

38:33.745 --> 38:35.179
We have to find out
where the thing came from.

38:35.181 --> 38:36.947
It's my birthday tomorrow.

38:36.949 --> 38:37.983
I know.

38:40.052 --> 38:42.187
That's why...

38:43.389 --> 38:45.724
...you have to let me lead you
to the truth.

38:49.428 --> 38:52.197
Why do you care so much?

38:52.931 --> 38:54.464
I mean, we just met.

38:54.466 --> 38:57.835
I don't know.
I don't know.

39:07.712 --> 39:09.812
I don't know
if it will change anything.

39:09.814 --> 39:12.250
I don't think it will.
But...

39:12.950 --> 39:16.185
...if you really do want
to stay with me,

39:16.187 --> 39:18.721
I'm going someplace today.

39:18.723 --> 39:21.125
Someone who might
be able to help.

39:22.126 --> 39:24.095
Do you want to come?

39:56.792 --> 39:58.526
Okay.
Pull over for a second.

39:58.528 --> 40:02.097
Okay.

40:20.449 --> 40:23.317
Wow. I've heard
a lot about this place.

40:23.319 --> 40:25.219
It's home of
the Ancestral Pueblo peoples.

40:25.221 --> 40:27.053
Some call them Anasazi.

40:27.055 --> 40:29.157
You know, they ruled this area
for hundreds of years.

40:30.892 --> 40:34.395
Let me grab my camera,
get some top view of this place.

40:37.966 --> 40:39.532
There's still a lot
of unanswered questions

40:39.534 --> 40:42.301
about their civilization.

40:42.303 --> 40:44.403
Yeah, like
why they built those pits.

40:44.405 --> 40:48.142
Allegedly contact
with extraterrestrials.

40:51.011 --> 40:53.011
You okay?

40:53.013 --> 40:54.879
Yeah.
We should get to the pueblo.

40:54.881 --> 40:55.949
It's not too far.

41:08.828 --> 41:10.996
- Just make a right here.
- Right here?

41:10.998 --> 41:12.432
Yeah.

41:18.037 --> 41:20.572
Not to be cynical, but...

41:20.574 --> 41:22.273
I'm still not sure
how these people can help you.

41:22.275 --> 41:24.511
Well, for starters,
they believe me.

41:25.878 --> 41:28.145
These people,
they practically raised me.

41:28.147 --> 41:30.614
They were there
when no one else cared.

41:30.616 --> 41:33.219
They taught me what it was like
to have a family...

41:34.387 --> 41:37.187
...and helped go through
some really hard times.

41:37.189 --> 41:38.989
They're
pretty incredible people.

41:38.991 --> 41:40.391
You might want
to show some respect.

41:40.393 --> 41:41.924
I don't mean to be
disrespectful.

41:41.926 --> 41:43.427
I'm just trying to understand.

41:43.429 --> 41:46.097
You can pull up just right here
on the left.

41:50.503 --> 41:52.470
- We made it.
- Yep.

42:01.146 --> 42:02.580
It's up here.

42:05.050 --> 42:06.582
Hi, Pants.

42:06.584 --> 42:08.050
You know these guys?

42:08.052 --> 42:10.186
Yeah.

42:10.188 --> 42:12.921
Good boy.

42:26.036 --> 42:28.170
Whew-whew!

42:28.172 --> 42:30.305
Whew.

42:30.307 --> 42:32.176
You ought to try
the sheep chili.

42:33.310 --> 42:36.244
It's out of this world.

42:36.246 --> 42:38.145
Literally.

42:38.147 --> 42:40.915
Elu.
I'm glad you came.

42:40.917 --> 42:42.116
It has been too long.

42:42.118 --> 42:43.585
- Mm.
- Elu?

42:43.587 --> 42:46.187
It's the Indian name
I was given.

42:46.189 --> 42:49.223
John, this is Chris Norton.
He's a filmmaker.

42:49.225 --> 42:50.491
This is John Greatbear.

42:50.493 --> 42:52.093
He's the village medicine man

42:52.095 --> 42:55.231
and the closest thing
I have to a father.

42:56.632 --> 42:57.966
More like grandpa.

43:03.038 --> 43:05.272
He's the one
who says he can protect me.

43:05.274 --> 43:07.508
But how can you protect her?

43:07.510 --> 43:10.443
My people have history...

43:10.445 --> 43:12.078
with the old ones.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.682
We have made an arrangement
in the past.

43:14.684 --> 43:16.249
Wait.
The "old ones"?

43:16.251 --> 43:18.887
Is that the ancient
Ancestral Pueblo peoples?

43:28.463 --> 43:30.432
Okay.

43:34.201 --> 43:36.001
It's cold outside.

43:36.003 --> 43:37.436
Thank you.

43:37.438 --> 43:40.707
Hey, nice to meet you.
I'm Brent.

43:40.709 --> 43:42.677
Camera guy.

43:45.079 --> 43:46.414
I love chili.

43:52.153 --> 43:54.753
There's a ritual.

43:54.755 --> 43:58.457
Something that might
convince them not to take me.

43:58.459 --> 44:02.328
It hasn't been done in a while,
but it can't hurt to try, right?

44:03.731 --> 44:06.531
I just don't want
anything to happen to you.

44:06.533 --> 44:08.132
I don't either.

44:53.244 --> 44:55.612
Come, my friend.

44:55.614 --> 44:57.079
Sit with us.

44:57.081 --> 45:00.585
Let us our mind in the cold...

45:01.285 --> 45:03.454
...and warm our heart in here.

46:17.793 --> 46:19.427
Drink.

46:29.637 --> 46:31.372
Don't be afraid.

46:32.574 --> 46:34.475
Who... me?

46:38.446 --> 46:39.845
You sure you want to do that?

46:39.847 --> 46:41.814
Remember Malibu?

46:41.816 --> 46:43.549
Doing mushrooms,
running around naked?

46:43.551 --> 46:45.517
Not a good idea.

46:54.895 --> 46:56.661
What are you doing?

46:56.663 --> 46:58.532
I want you to wear this
for a while.

47:00.901 --> 47:04.769
I could never remember
where I actually got it.

47:04.771 --> 47:06.573
So I just made up my own story.

47:09.475 --> 47:12.509
I was with my mom,
and we were picking flowers.

47:12.511 --> 47:15.816
And they smelt so wonderful,
and...

47:16.582 --> 47:19.416
...then we turned
into the rainbow, and...

47:19.418 --> 47:21.285
the little shadow
that runs across the grass

47:21.287 --> 47:22.688
into the sunset.

47:24.357 --> 47:26.256
This was always there
to remind me that...

47:26.258 --> 47:29.495
sometimes dreams
are more real than the truth.

47:34.900 --> 47:37.135
Don't let go of the dream.

47:42.340 --> 47:43.808
I won't.

47:53.284 --> 47:54.619
See you on the other side.

48:53.810 --> 48:56.844
You took everything from me!
You took my mother!

49:01.383 --> 49:03.416
You took my mom!

49:03.418 --> 49:05.719
You took my mom!

49:05.721 --> 49:09.925
You beat me, you beat me,
and you beat me!

49:10.926 --> 49:13.326
You took my mom!

49:15.030 --> 49:17.430
You took my mom!

50:11.584 --> 50:13.953
I thought you were a dead man.

50:17.623 --> 50:19.689
I thought you OD'd
on that stuff.

50:19.691 --> 50:22.726
- What happened?
- You freaked out.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.728
You don't remember anything?

50:24.730 --> 50:26.965
No, not really.

50:33.372 --> 50:34.771
Hey.

50:34.773 --> 50:38.041
How are you feeling?

50:38.043 --> 50:40.376
Oh, God.

50:40.378 --> 50:42.047
Like I got run over by a truck.

50:45.017 --> 50:47.550
So...

50:47.552 --> 50:49.387
what's Crazy Bear saying?

50:50.488 --> 50:52.855
Greatbear.

50:52.857 --> 50:56.926
Nothing yet. He's waiting
to see if the ritual worked.

50:56.928 --> 50:58.496
How long until we know?

51:00.398 --> 51:03.866
- Couple hours.
- Oh, God.

51:03.868 --> 51:07.638
A couple hours.

51:09.140 --> 51:12.540
We're supposed to sit here
and wait until then?

51:12.542 --> 51:15.345
Yeah, pretty much.

51:16.847 --> 51:18.847
I think my hand's turning blue.

51:18.849 --> 51:22.083
Hmm? Oh.

51:22.085 --> 51:23.854
Sorry.

51:29.960 --> 51:32.562
How are you so calm?

51:35.866 --> 51:38.367
I don't know.

51:39.501 --> 51:42.371
Normally I'd be a wreck, but...

51:43.206 --> 51:44.872
...I think it's you.
I just...

51:44.874 --> 51:47.110
I don't feel afraid now
because of you.

51:47.843 --> 51:50.512
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

52:02.024 --> 52:04.126
All right, well...

52:05.094 --> 52:08.061
...you got the rough cut
and the raw footage?

52:08.063 --> 52:11.166
- Yeah. Why?
- All right.

52:11.866 --> 52:14.535
I'm gonna get to work.

52:56.109 --> 52:57.976
My name is Chris Norton.

52:57.978 --> 53:01.012
And I'm
a documentary filmmaker.

53:01.014 --> 53:04.815
I shot my first film,
if you can call it that,

53:04.817 --> 53:06.617
on my 7th birthday.

53:16.829 --> 53:18.698
This way.

53:31.576 --> 53:33.576
There is a way of a thing,

53:33.578 --> 53:36.548
and some
outside our understanding.

53:41.586 --> 53:43.555
The ceremony did not work.

53:44.756 --> 53:46.022
I am very sorry.

53:46.024 --> 53:47.589
What does that mean?

53:47.591 --> 53:50.093
It means
the sky people will come.

53:50.095 --> 53:53.096
They will take her.

53:53.098 --> 53:56.034
There is nothing more
that we can do.

53:56.767 --> 53:59.168
Do you know
how much time we wasted?

53:59.170 --> 54:02.070
Hours.
We wasted hours.

54:02.072 --> 54:04.706
I could have her
in Fort Knox by now.

54:04.708 --> 54:07.843
It will not matter.
They need her.

54:07.845 --> 54:10.579
What could
they possibly need her for?

54:10.581 --> 54:12.147
Something important.

54:12.149 --> 54:15.786
Something they have lost
through time.

54:16.987 --> 54:20.956
Their civilization
honors the rational mind,

54:20.958 --> 54:23.893
but has forgotten the gift.

54:24.594 --> 54:27.530
They need to find a way back...

54:28.664 --> 54:30.164
...to their soul.

54:30.166 --> 54:32.099
I drank your potion.
I trusted you.

54:32.101 --> 54:35.636
We trusted you. You said
that you could help her.

54:35.638 --> 54:37.805
Let's just go, okay?
Let's go, okay?

54:37.807 --> 54:39.609
Let's go.

54:40.910 --> 54:43.112
Elu.

54:43.813 --> 54:47.048
You were chosen
for a great cause.

54:47.050 --> 54:50.552
It is a burden
that is part of your destiny.

54:52.687 --> 54:56.558
Don't let go of the dream,
my child.

55:31.659 --> 55:33.593
I'm sorry.

55:34.128 --> 55:36.727
- Okay, look, where are we going?
- I don't know where we're going.

55:36.729 --> 55:37.963
Somewhere to protect her.

55:37.965 --> 55:41.302
We need to get her
somewhere safe.

55:42.203 --> 55:46.205
I don't know. Somewhere where we
can create a defense, all right?

55:46.207 --> 55:48.840
Sounds like a plan.
Not sure what it means exactly.

55:48.842 --> 55:50.675
But we'll get somewhere safe.

55:50.677 --> 55:54.245
You don't understand.
It doesn't matter where we go...

55:54.247 --> 55:55.949
- or what we do.
- Look out!

56:01.054 --> 56:03.957
What the hell is that?

56:05.458 --> 56:07.058
Ah, but what the fuck is this?

56:07.060 --> 56:08.627
No, no, no.

56:09.329 --> 56:11.062
I'm gonna drive now.

56:11.064 --> 56:12.163
What?

56:12.165 --> 56:13.932
Chris.
Move the car!

56:15.200 --> 56:16.933
I'm trying.
I'm trying. I'm trying.

56:16.935 --> 56:19.771
- It's not going.
- Come on! Move!

56:21.206 --> 56:22.806
It's not moving!

56:22.808 --> 56:25.144
- Lock the doors!
- Oh, shit.

56:27.779 --> 56:31.214
- Don't!
- Emily! Emily!

56:31.216 --> 56:32.415
- Emily!
- Ow!

56:32.417 --> 56:34.384
Aah! No!

56:34.386 --> 56:37.055
Emily!

56:37.989 --> 56:39.989
Emily!

56:39.991 --> 56:41.891
Emily! Emily!

56:41.893 --> 56:44.695
Hey! Emily!

56:48.132 --> 56:49.867
Oh! Aah!

57:17.127 --> 57:19.794
Aah!
You sons of bitches.

57:24.401 --> 57:29.105
I didn't want it to come
to this, that's for sure.

57:30.507 --> 57:34.875
I was told you were doing
a story on abduction,

57:34.877 --> 57:38.178
not a hatchet job
on our way of life.

57:38.180 --> 57:41.448
Then, when I found out
your true intent,

57:41.450 --> 57:46.253
well, I asked you to leave,
but you didn't listen, did you?

57:46.255 --> 57:47.856
It's all a bunch of bullshit?

57:50.459 --> 57:54.927
Oh, no.
It's quite real.

57:54.929 --> 57:58.967
We just help perpetuate
the truth.

58:01.403 --> 58:03.938
Jesus Christ.

58:06.174 --> 58:08.575
The footage is on the laptop,
but they might have copies.

58:08.577 --> 58:10.778
We have to be sure.

58:15.950 --> 58:19.118
You were right about
the false memories, you know?

58:19.120 --> 58:20.754
Even more than you think.

58:26.561 --> 58:28.159
What the fuck are you doing?

58:28.161 --> 58:30.095
Don't worry.

58:30.097 --> 58:34.466
I'm a pro.
I've done this a hundred times.

58:34.468 --> 58:39.404
Now, back in the MK-Ultra days,
it was trial and error.

58:39.406 --> 58:42.474
But now we got it
down to a science.

58:42.476 --> 58:46.177
All it takes is a little
military-grade hallucinogen

58:46.179 --> 58:48.912
and a little creative
set design,

58:48.914 --> 58:53.150
and your subconscious mind
will absolutely be convinced

58:53.152 --> 58:56.020
that this abduction was real.

58:56.022 --> 58:57.354
Don't worry.

58:57.356 --> 58:59.323
In a couple minutes,
you'll black out,

58:59.325 --> 59:01.158
and two hours from now,

59:01.160 --> 59:03.894
you'll remember
what everyone else does.

59:03.896 --> 59:06.030
Aah! Aah!

59:06.032 --> 59:09.133
Well, damn.
I missed the vein.

59:09.135 --> 59:12.403
Steel rooms.
Figures in black.

59:12.405 --> 59:15.139
Bright lights and... Hold still.

59:15.141 --> 59:17.408
Hold still, God damn it.

59:17.410 --> 59:19.175
You hold still,
'cause, otherwise,

59:19.177 --> 59:22.013
I'll get the cattle prod,
and I'll hit you with it again.

59:24.450 --> 59:26.349
Don't you worry.

59:26.351 --> 59:29.452
It'll all be over soon.

59:29.454 --> 59:33.423
And the great Chris Norton
will corroborate the truth.

59:33.425 --> 59:37.527
That alien abductions are real.

59:37.529 --> 59:41.564
- Aah! Aah!
- God damn it!

59:41.566 --> 59:43.999
You crazy son of a bitch!

59:44.001 --> 59:48.540
As usual, you just have to do it
the hard way, don't you?

59:50.007 --> 59:51.443
Well...

59:53.410 --> 59:55.477
...I think I'll just...

59:55.479 --> 01:00:00.551
go get a cattle prod
and another needle.

01:00:02.653 --> 01:00:05.022
Don't go anywhere...

01:00:06.156 --> 01:00:08.292
...cowboy.

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:10.550
- Hey, man.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:01:10.552 --> 01:01:12.117
- Quiet.
- Where are we?

01:01:12.119 --> 01:01:14.153
It's Bill.
We got to get out of here.

01:01:14.155 --> 01:01:17.024
- What a dick.
- Quiet.

01:01:24.632 --> 01:01:25.499
Chris?

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.367
- All right.
- Where are we?

01:01:28.369 --> 01:01:30.335
- Shh, shh. It's okay.
- Are we...

01:01:30.337 --> 01:01:32.103
No.
It's all Bill.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.405
- It's not real.
- What?

01:01:33.407 --> 01:01:34.440
- Yeah.
- Bill?

01:01:34.442 --> 01:01:36.209
What are you talking about?

01:01:37.177 --> 01:01:39.110
Chris?

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:41.682
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh.

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:45.751
It's all a hoax.

01:01:45.753 --> 01:01:47.185
It's been Bill all along.

01:01:47.187 --> 01:01:48.719
- What?
- It's all a setup.

01:01:48.721 --> 01:01:50.788
It's all bullshit...
the metal table,

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:53.959
the abductions, all of it.

01:01:56.028 --> 01:01:57.595
- Just breathe, okay?
- What are you talking about?

01:01:57.597 --> 01:01:59.597
- Just breathe.
- It doesn't make any sense.

01:01:59.599 --> 01:02:01.399
It happened to me my whole life.

01:02:01.401 --> 01:02:03.768
It's all a hoax. It's all
bullshit. It's all a setup.

01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:06.136
It doesn't make any sense.

01:02:06.138 --> 01:02:08.138
The first time it happened,
I was so young.

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.372
It doesn't make any sense.

01:02:09.374 --> 01:02:10.775
I know. I know.

01:02:10.777 --> 01:02:12.375
We're gonna do this together.
Come on.

01:02:12.377 --> 01:02:14.144
I'm gonna get us out of here.

01:02:14.146 --> 01:02:16.181
Man, you're bleeding.

01:02:19.284 --> 01:02:21.052
Oh, yeah. There.
Yeah.

01:02:23.689 --> 01:02:26.358
Just stay quiet, okay?
They're right out there.

01:02:34.432 --> 01:02:36.298
Let's go.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.534
All right.

01:02:38.536 --> 01:02:41.005
I need a beer.

01:02:43.207 --> 01:02:46.308
- Oh!
- You okay?

01:02:55.252 --> 01:02:57.555
Jesus.
Where are we?

01:03:13.537 --> 01:03:15.436
What?

01:03:15.438 --> 01:03:17.507
We got to turn around.

01:03:18.207 --> 01:03:20.309
Find another way out.

01:03:22.144 --> 01:03:24.146
Oh, shit.

01:03:25.314 --> 01:03:26.783
Over here! Bill!

01:03:33.756 --> 01:03:35.758
Watch him.

01:03:39.261 --> 01:03:41.330
Yeah.

01:03:42.398 --> 01:03:44.598
There ain't nowhere to go.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.567
Is there, boy?

01:03:46.569 --> 01:03:48.402
All right.

01:03:48.404 --> 01:03:50.573
You don't want this
to get out of hand.

01:03:52.775 --> 01:03:56.210
We'll give you all the footage,
and we'll go.

01:04:29.176 --> 01:04:30.377
Oh, my God.

01:05:02.408 --> 01:05:04.508
Bill.
No, Bill, stop! Stop!

01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:06.311
Bill!

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:34.873
Emily!

01:05:35.907 --> 01:05:38.409
Emily!

01:06:11.641 --> 01:06:13.209
Where...

01:06:15.045 --> 01:06:16.913
Emily.

01:06:22.018 --> 01:06:23.951
Okay. Emily.

01:06:23.953 --> 01:06:25.855
Wake... up.

01:07:04.358 --> 01:07:07.593
Emily. Emily.

01:07:07.595 --> 01:07:10.529
I need you
to listen to my voice.

01:07:10.531 --> 01:07:12.266
Okay?

01:07:13.033 --> 01:07:15.569
I need you to come back to me.

01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:18.670
I've never met anyone like you
in my life.

01:07:18.672 --> 01:07:20.506
You're kind to people.

01:07:20.508 --> 01:07:22.875
You take care of them.

01:07:22.877 --> 01:07:25.880
Emily.
I need you to wake up.

01:07:28.414 --> 01:07:30.350
That's it.

01:07:32.619 --> 01:07:33.818
You can do it.

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.553
Concentrate on my voice.

01:07:35.555 --> 01:07:36.821
Concentrate.

01:07:36.823 --> 01:07:38.491
You can create your own dreams.

01:07:39.025 --> 01:07:40.958
Okay.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.762
That's it.

01:07:45.498 --> 01:07:47.399
<i>Okay.</i>
There you go.

01:07:57.609 --> 01:07:59.709
- Chris?
- Yeah.

01:07:59.711 --> 01:08:01.814
You're here.

01:08:27.971 --> 01:08:29.407
Are you okay?

01:08:30.441 --> 01:08:32.109
Yeah.

01:08:35.011 --> 01:08:37.081
Oh, God.

01:08:37.849 --> 01:08:39.849
- Help me out here.
- I'm afraid if I push

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:42.051
the wrong one,
something bad will happen.

01:08:42.053 --> 01:08:45.020
Yeah, well,
we gotta try something, right?

01:08:45.022 --> 01:08:46.822
And I won't hold it against you

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:48.790
if my eyeballs explode
or anything.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:51.361
Come on.
No pressure.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.867
Oh. Good.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.970
What do we do now?

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:10.678
I don't know. Figure out
how to get the hell out of here.

01:10:25.619 --> 01:10:27.688
Who's there?

01:11:10.562 --> 01:11:13.765
What? Chris.

01:11:26.144 --> 01:11:27.811
What do you want?

01:11:33.851 --> 01:11:35.819
Stay back.

01:11:38.622 --> 01:11:41.125
Stay back.

01:11:47.297 --> 01:11:50.067
No. No more of that.
We're done with that.

01:11:54.837 --> 01:11:59.209
<i>How many times have
I told you never to do this?!</i>

01:12:00.277 --> 01:12:03.211
- <i>You get off him!</i>
- <i>Hey!</i>

01:12:03.213 --> 01:12:04.612
<i>Stay out of it!</i>

01:12:04.614 --> 01:12:06.714
I don't remember this.

01:12:06.716 --> 01:12:08.951
- <i>What is wrong with you?!</i>
- <i>Get away! Hey!</i>

01:12:10.119 --> 01:12:12.119
<i>Stop it! Shut up!</i>

01:12:17.326 --> 01:12:18.926
<i>Nell!</i>

01:12:18.928 --> 01:12:20.961
<i>Where are you going?!</i>

01:12:20.963 --> 01:12:22.862
<i>Are you happy now?!</i>

01:12:22.864 --> 01:12:26.001
<i>Just come on back!</i>

01:12:27.069 --> 01:12:29.636
<i>Chris.
Go on, keep back.</i>

01:12:29.638 --> 01:12:31.272
<i>Nell!</i>

01:12:31.274 --> 01:12:33.909
<i>Nell!</i>

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.733
What?
They took <i>you.</i>

01:13:01.735 --> 01:13:03.637
No.

01:13:05.106 --> 01:13:06.307
That's impossible.

01:13:07.441 --> 01:13:09.775
Make it stop.
Make it...

01:13:09.777 --> 01:13:11.178
What do you want?!

01:13:16.016 --> 01:13:18.252
Aah! Aah.

01:13:21.855 --> 01:13:24.222
Aah! Uhh!

01:13:24.224 --> 01:13:26.224
Stop. Please.

01:13:26.226 --> 01:13:28.194
Please stop!

01:14:20.512 --> 01:14:22.079
Who are you?

01:14:23.447 --> 01:14:27.185
<i>We are the product of human
evolution over many years.</i>

01:14:27.985 --> 01:14:29.251
What?

01:14:29.253 --> 01:14:32.421
<i>In time, our ego crystallized.</i>

01:14:32.423 --> 01:14:34.490
<i>We have become tethered
to reason,</i>

01:14:34.492 --> 01:14:36.292
<i>and something is lost.</i>

01:14:36.294 --> 01:14:38.194
What are you doing to us?

01:14:38.196 --> 01:14:42.264
<i>We erased the bad memories
to understand if your future</i>

01:14:42.266 --> 01:14:43.967
<i>could be different
than the past.</i>

01:14:44.935 --> 01:14:46.836
We don't need you.

01:14:51.007 --> 01:14:52.809
Not anymore.

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.224
Please.

01:15:07.957 --> 01:15:09.992
We just want to go home.

01:15:25.274 --> 01:15:27.276
Hey, guys.

01:15:28.277 --> 01:15:29.809
Did you see that light?

01:15:29.811 --> 01:15:31.411
You...

01:15:31.413 --> 01:15:32.945
Did you guys see that UFO...

01:15:32.947 --> 01:15:34.046
in the sky?

01:15:34.048 --> 01:15:36.283
Huh?
Don't ignore me.

01:15:36.285 --> 01:15:38.150
Hey. Hey, guys.

01:15:38.152 --> 01:15:39.986
Hey!
Over here!

01:15:39.988 --> 01:15:41.220
Channel 4, NMX News.

01:15:41.222 --> 01:15:43.389
We have reports
of strange lights.

01:15:43.391 --> 01:15:45.324
- Who are you?
- We're filmmakers.

01:15:45.326 --> 01:15:46.525
We're from Hollywood.

01:15:46.527 --> 01:15:49.330
We're making a documentary.

01:15:50.198 --> 01:15:52.131
An unbelievable story
that adds yet another claim

01:15:52.133 --> 01:15:55.167
of alien abduction
in our community.

01:15:55.169 --> 01:15:57.303
Our reporter Kelly Lamas
has the story.

01:15:57.305 --> 01:15:58.504
- Kelly.
- Thank you, Carlos.

01:15:58.506 --> 01:16:00.138
I'm in McKinley County,

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.940
where local artist Emily Reed...

01:16:01.942 --> 01:16:05.178
<i>Turns out we were gone
for only two hours.</i>

01:16:06.079 --> 01:16:07.781
<i>Kyle disappeared.</i>

01:16:08.882 --> 01:16:12.851
<i>As for us, we can
only remember flashes, but...</i>

01:16:12.853 --> 01:16:15.020
<i>we remember enough.</i>

01:16:15.022 --> 01:16:16.554
Are you on any narcotics?

01:16:16.556 --> 01:16:17.856
I'm not sure what happened.

01:16:17.858 --> 01:16:19.491
There was a light in the sky.

01:16:19.493 --> 01:16:21.959
And I think...
I think it was UFO.

01:16:21.961 --> 01:16:23.428
<i>Our story was dismissed</i>

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:26.264
<i>as being the product
of hallucinogenic drugs.</i>

01:16:26.266 --> 01:16:29.802
<i>The irony is, I became the
thing I was most resistant to.</i>

01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:33.103
- <i>I became the story.</i>
- ...may finally shed some light

01:16:33.105 --> 01:16:34.572
on this
controversial phenomenon.

01:16:34.574 --> 01:16:39.812
Is it aliens, or is it just
the mind playing tricks?

01:16:44.383 --> 01:16:46.617
Take that!

01:16:50.289 --> 01:16:51.422
- What?!
- Oh!

01:16:51.424 --> 01:16:53.657
Oh, no!

01:16:57.228 --> 01:17:00.430
- Brent! Come on!
- These things happen.

01:17:00.432 --> 01:17:02.498
You know what?
I actually like you.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.401
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

01:17:05.403 --> 01:17:07.036
You know what happens
when we tell him.

01:17:07.038 --> 01:17:08.938
I know, but Brent
likes to participate.

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.073
He's gonna make it worse.

01:17:10.075 --> 01:17:11.374
He likes to participate.

01:17:11.376 --> 01:17:12.675
He likes
to feel like he's part of it.

01:17:12.677 --> 01:17:14.210
Surprise!

01:17:14.212 --> 01:17:17.080
Surprise!

01:17:17.082 --> 01:17:19.582
- Hey, give me the face.
- Yeah!

01:17:19.584 --> 01:17:23.020
- Is it for me?
- Yeah, it's for you.

01:17:29.661 --> 01:17:31.960
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

01:17:31.962 --> 01:17:34.262
Happy 7th birthday.

01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:57.509
We saw a light in the trees.

01:18:57.511 --> 01:19:00.779
And I got up.

01:19:00.781 --> 01:19:03.047
Went up for a closer look.

01:19:03.049 --> 01:19:08.420
And I was hit by a blast
of energy from the craft

01:19:08.422 --> 01:19:10.689
that knocked me unconscious.

01:19:10.691 --> 01:19:12.390
I woke up on board the craft.

01:19:12.392 --> 01:19:16.664
Do you have any hard,
actual, physical evidence?
