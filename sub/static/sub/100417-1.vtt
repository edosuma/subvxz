00:26.548 --> 00:28.028
Nietzsche famously said that

00:28.158 --> 00:30.639
without music,
life would be a mistake.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.685
German philosophers
tend to exaggerate.

00:34.556 --> 00:35.774
But he did have a point.

00:36.993 --> 00:38.255
I know that without music

00:38.386 --> 00:39.909
my own life would've been

00:40.040 --> 00:42.781
incomplete in
some fundamental way.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.132
Like if I'd had no friends

00:45.262 --> 00:46.872
or no memories.

00:47.003 --> 00:49.527
I even tried to be
a pianist for a while

00:49.658 --> 00:51.616
until I realized
just how fragile

00:51.747 --> 00:53.053
piano playing really is.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.492
Especially
in front of 2,000 people.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.263
The most
difficult thing

01:29.393 --> 01:31.395
is to leave your fingers alone,

01:31.526 --> 01:33.397
to just play and not think,

01:34.006 --> 01:35.138
never open that door,

01:36.574 --> 01:38.533
otherwise you won't
be making music for long.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.839
You'll be running for dear life.

02:52.476 --> 02:53.260
Fuck.

02:56.698 --> 02:57.742
I'm fine.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.050
Can I have...

03:14.150 --> 03:16.587
Security to the front entrance.

03:36.868 --> 03:37.739
Henry?

03:39.741 --> 03:40.568
Henry.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.135
Just having a smoke.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.225
You don't smoke.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.231
You got the heebie-jeebies?

03:53.102 --> 03:54.582
Do you realize
how reckless it is

03:54.712 --> 03:56.323
to play in front of an audience?

03:57.846 --> 03:59.239
It's why they come, you know.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.505
Like those cliff divers
I saw the other day on TV.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.725
People enjoy the show but really

04:08.987 --> 04:11.729
it's the looming
disaster that makes it special.

04:14.863 --> 04:15.690
May I?

04:24.220 --> 04:25.047
Do you hear that?

04:34.926 --> 04:36.972
Some pianists are cerebral,

04:37.886 --> 04:39.235
others sentimental.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.979
Henry Cole is
an existential pianist.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.634
He plays with his whole life.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.340
Of course, being existential about anything

04:57.471 --> 04:58.950
can be complicated.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.930
Henry. Henry, relax,
it's just a few reporters.

06:06.844 --> 06:09.020
What
made you decide to play again?

06:09.151 --> 06:10.457
Playing is my life.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.546
Happy with your performance?

06:12.676 --> 06:14.286
How'd it feel to
give a recital again

06:14.417 --> 06:15.723
after all of these years?

06:16.332 --> 06:17.681
Like a trip to the moon.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.292
Why didn't you give an encore?

06:24.166 --> 06:25.733
- Uh...
- Sorry.

06:25.863 --> 06:26.908
...I like...

06:30.172 --> 06:32.392
- Sorry.
- I like clean breaks...

06:34.132 --> 06:34.959
the way...

06:36.308 --> 06:37.397
the ocean...

06:39.486 --> 06:43.054
abruptly ends between your feet,

06:43.185 --> 06:45.056
the edge of a dying wave.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.844
And I couldn't think
of anything else to play.

06:49.974 --> 06:53.935
-The need to share it, isn't
that what drives most musicians?

06:54.065 --> 06:56.894
I think what
drives most musicians

06:57.025 --> 06:59.680
is not dissimilar from
what drives most people.

06:59.810 --> 07:00.942
And what's that?

07:01.943 --> 07:03.640
People want to be appreciated.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.993
-Indeed.
-Why the "Fantasie"?

07:09.124 --> 07:10.995
Is it because it is
meant as a cry of despair

07:11.126 --> 07:13.041
after the separation from Clara?

07:14.042 --> 07:17.219
When Schumann was asked
what he meant by the piece,

07:17.349 --> 07:19.917
do you know what
he said? Nothing.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.485
He just sat down at
the piano and played it again.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.053
However, some scientists claim

07:25.183 --> 07:26.533
that we owe the "Fantasie"

07:26.663 --> 07:29.187
as well as
numerous other masterpieces

07:29.318 --> 07:31.015
to treponema pallidum.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.061
Is she a composer?

07:33.191 --> 07:35.237
She's the syphilis bacterium.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.500
Is it true you didn't touch
a piano for three years--

07:37.631 --> 07:39.023
Thank you very much.
That'll be all for today.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.634
Thank you so much
for coming this evening.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.331
Some say you
never even left your room.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.116
-What happened, Mr. Cole?
- Please just one more.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.554
Why would anybody care

07:48.076 --> 07:49.338
if I left my room or not?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.861
Oh, they don't,
that was just a kid

07:50.992 --> 07:52.254
trying to get some gossip.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.564
What about you, Paul?

07:59.435 --> 08:00.654
You know what matters to me?

08:01.393 --> 08:05.093
Is that you are here,
right where you belong.

08:05.615 --> 08:08.357
Tonight was important,
Henry, and you showed
an amazing amount of strength.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.750
You were great.

08:13.754 --> 08:14.581
Yes!

08:22.589 --> 08:23.415
Hi.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.156
Sorry about before.

08:25.896 --> 08:26.941
I didn't mean to pry.

08:28.377 --> 08:29.291
I'm Helen Morrison.

08:30.422 --> 08:31.511
I write for The New Yorker.

08:31.641 --> 08:34.470
Music is never about despair.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.775
It's a celebration.

08:36.645 --> 08:37.517
A victory.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.129
And being
appreciated is not enough.

08:41.607 --> 08:45.568
Most people want
to overcome something.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.788
Were you celebrating
a victory tonight?

08:48.658 --> 08:49.746
You're prying again.

08:51.487 --> 08:52.314
Sorry.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.535
I just play the notes.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.059
You had me fooled.

08:58.755 --> 08:59.669
Well, thank you.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.237
I'm sorry, um...

09:03.325 --> 09:05.675
you don't remember me, but...

09:07.416 --> 09:09.461
you changed my
life 15 years ago.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.290
I did?

09:13.509 --> 09:15.293
You were giving
a masterclass at Julliard

09:15.816 --> 09:18.383
and, um, I had just been cut,

09:18.514 --> 09:20.603
first round of
a minor competition.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.563
I lacked the basic talent of...

09:25.303 --> 09:26.478
not shaking.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.437
How unfair.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.179
"What matters most
is experience," you said,

09:31.309 --> 09:32.528
"Not performance.

09:34.008 --> 09:37.359
The greatest gift, what
truly sets people apart is...

09:38.926 --> 09:40.014
the ability to feel."

09:41.711 --> 09:42.582
I said that?

09:43.887 --> 09:45.193
Yeah, you did.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.894
You know, there was also this...

09:52.156 --> 09:52.983
Never mind.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.247
Well, it's a long story.

09:56.770 --> 09:57.727
Tell me.

09:59.860 --> 10:00.904
Really?

10:09.260 --> 10:10.610
I spent a month

10:10.740 --> 10:12.350
in the Upper Engadine Valley

10:12.481 --> 10:13.613
in the Swiss Alps,

10:13.743 --> 10:15.615
just after my
competition disaster.

10:16.093 --> 10:18.226
There's a lake
there called Silvaplana

10:18.922 --> 10:20.489
where I would take long walks

10:20.620 --> 10:22.056
every day along the shore,

10:23.448 --> 10:24.580
thinking about what you said.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.365
And by the side of the path

10:27.496 --> 10:29.498
there was this boulder.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.458
You know, nothing special,
just a... big old rock.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.026
But every day
I would walk by it,

10:36.157 --> 10:37.724
and there it was, the same,

10:37.854 --> 10:39.377
just sitting there quietly

10:39.508 --> 10:41.771
as it had been for 1,000 years.

10:45.035 --> 10:47.342
And there was something
comforting about that rock,

10:47.908 --> 10:48.822
like a,

10:49.997 --> 10:52.782
reminder of
the world outside myself.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.180
I would like to
do an article on you.

11:00.703 --> 11:01.748
Ah...

11:02.357 --> 11:03.663
Something comprehensive.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.013
It sounds unpleasant.

11:06.796 --> 11:11.148
I appreciate it,
but there is a lot to be said

11:11.279 --> 11:13.803
for staying at
the surface of things.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.765
Well, this would
be about music mostly.

11:20.114 --> 11:20.941
Your career.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.596
Could I ask for an interview?

11:25.380 --> 11:26.381
When you have time.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.645
Minimal prying, I promise!

11:29.776 --> 11:30.951
It's not a good idea.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.822
And if you'll excuse me,

11:32.953 --> 11:34.911
I am expected
somewhere, thank you.

11:35.042 --> 11:35.825
Good night.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.351
Good night.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.710
Apparently,
this rock is where

11:50.840 --> 11:52.320
Nietzsche
had his vision of the eternal

11:52.450 --> 11:53.930
recurrence of all things.

11:54.757 --> 11:57.325
The idea that
every event and every life

11:57.455 --> 11:59.196
will repeat itself infinitely.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.330
But if I can't recall
having been here before,

12:02.460 --> 12:04.027
what difference does it make?

12:04.854 --> 12:06.551
Unless he meant something else,

12:07.291 --> 12:08.118
like fate.

12:09.293 --> 12:10.860
Or simply that
life is a challenge.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.445
If there
is anything you need,

13:57.575 --> 13:58.750
please don't hesitate.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.014
My name is Felix.

14:02.537 --> 14:03.364
Thank you.

14:05.148 --> 14:06.454
In the folder there is a map of

14:06.584 --> 14:08.108
all the hiking
trails in the region.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.720
I highly
recommend the experience.

14:15.593 --> 14:16.551
I'll make a note of it.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.340
These just arrived for you, sir.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.124
Ah.

15:08.995 --> 15:09.865
Thank you.

15:14.087 --> 15:14.914
Lovely.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.149
How's the man
this morning?

15:35.717 --> 15:37.980
You look like
the cat that got the cream.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.591
-Have you seen the papers?
-Nope.

15:41.549 --> 15:42.550
"A trip to the moon."

15:43.159 --> 15:44.508
"The bewitching return

15:44.639 --> 15:47.163
of Britain's
grand master of the keyboard."

15:48.077 --> 15:49.644
I've been on
the phone all morning.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.951
Everyone is asking for
interviews, including the BBC.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.300
And they're gonna run
an hour long special

15:53.430 --> 15:54.388
before the London concert.

15:55.867 --> 15:58.305
It is everywhere

15:58.435 --> 15:59.349
on social media.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.873
And the whole world

16:02.004 --> 16:03.963
will be able to
watch your recital

16:04.093 --> 16:05.573
live on the internet, Henry.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.271
You're really reaching
out to the younger crowd.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.665
Well, I like that.
That makes me happy.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.362
-Mm-hmm.
-Um...

16:13.320 --> 16:14.669
anything from The New Yorker?

16:14.799 --> 16:16.105
No, nothing so far.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.674
Oh, those are nice flowers.

16:19.804 --> 16:22.590
Did you know that some
of the loveliest flowers

16:22.720 --> 16:26.246
mimic the smell of fecal matter,

16:26.376 --> 16:29.118
so as to attract dung insects?

16:29.249 --> 16:31.381
Why not attract other insects?

16:33.688 --> 16:35.995
I got to go. I got to meet
the guy at DDI Classics.

16:36.125 --> 16:39.172
Now, I'll see you later
this afternoon, around two.

16:39.302 --> 16:42.610
Oh, and, uh, don't forget
you have to try out
that new Steinway tonight.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.264
-Oh, I know, I know.
-Yeah.

16:45.569 --> 16:46.396
Paul?

16:47.354 --> 16:48.311
Yes, Henry.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.661
No reporters tonight,

16:50.792 --> 16:51.575
right?

16:53.012 --> 16:56.232
Right. No reporters.
Just a manager and a technician.

16:58.713 --> 16:59.627
Here.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.194
Read for yourself.

17:07.287 --> 17:08.330
Yeah, hello.

17:08.462 --> 17:09.244
Yeah, Paul.

17:19.994 --> 17:22.040
Sorry to
disturb you, Mr Cole.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.738
Could I ask for your autograph?

17:23.867 --> 17:25.566
I was at the concert last night.

17:25.695 --> 17:26.915
Magnificent!

17:27.046 --> 17:28.786
I drove all the way from Boston.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.354
Oh, you didn't have
to drive all that way.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.313
I'll be playing in
Boston a week from now.

17:33.443 --> 17:36.316
-I know. I'm taking my son.
-Ah.

17:36.794 --> 17:40.059
Well, that automatically
qualifies you for an autograph.

17:41.147 --> 17:44.976
-What's your name?
-Maya. But it's not for me,
it's for my son.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.413
-Daniel.
-Uh-uh.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.502
-How old is he?
-12.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.808
Music is everything to him.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.506
I mean, it's all he cares about.

17:52.636 --> 17:53.594
Tell you what,

17:54.986 --> 17:57.467
bring him backstage
after the recital next week.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.904
-I'll sign it for him then.
-Really?

18:00.035 --> 18:02.298
He has a poster of
you in his room, you know.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.344
-A poster.
-Yeah.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.955
-I hope it doesn't
give him nightmares.

18:08.348 --> 18:09.784
You should put those in water.

18:10.350 --> 18:11.351
Yes, I should.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.093
-Maya...
-Yes.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.098
Did you really
enjoy the recital?

18:20.360 --> 18:21.361
Of course!

18:24.538 --> 18:26.540
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

21:06.352 --> 21:07.396
You play the piano?

21:08.571 --> 21:09.877
Yes, a little bit.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.748
You?

21:11.879 --> 21:13.054
Yeah.

21:13.184 --> 21:14.534
Mostly by ear.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.536
I can pick up
pretty much any tune.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.539
I've got a soft spot
for the oldies, though.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.280
-So do I.
-Mm.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.109
I like classical too,

21:25.240 --> 21:29.026
but I find some
pieces are a little long.

21:29.592 --> 21:30.941
Ain't that the truth.

21:32.639 --> 21:33.640
Have a good evening.

21:34.467 --> 21:35.294
You too.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.312
Do you like
flowers, Mr. Cole?

21:55.531 --> 21:57.620
I like all quiet forms of life.

21:58.621 --> 21:59.579
Fish?

21:59.970 --> 22:00.797
Them too.

22:03.452 --> 22:04.584
I'm sorry,
I haven't eaten all day.

22:05.193 --> 22:08.196
I'm a little
surprised to see you here.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.504
I was in the neighborhood.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.030
Actually, my friend
told me you would be here.

22:16.160 --> 22:16.944
Ah.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.644
Did you like my flowers?

22:21.775 --> 22:23.167
I did, thank you.

22:26.475 --> 22:28.216
You didn't write a review.

22:29.478 --> 22:30.740
I'm working on something else.

22:35.919 --> 22:36.746
What?

22:36.877 --> 22:38.705
You have something here.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.272
No the other side.

22:43.753 --> 22:44.580
May I?

22:49.193 --> 22:50.281
Gone.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.284
We made all
the adjustments.
I think you'll be pleased.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.198
Thank you.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.075
Ah, let's see.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.740
The mind
is where it all happens.

23:14.741 --> 23:17.221
It's best not to
wander in there too long.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.833
You never know when
it's going to turn on you.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.487
Move over a little, will you?

24:37.258 --> 24:38.955
Do you still
want that interview?

25:35.664 --> 25:38.362
London concert, sold out.

25:38.493 --> 25:40.147
They're even putting
extra seats on the stage,

25:40.277 --> 25:43.411
-including one for
the Prime Minister.
-Come on through.

25:48.285 --> 25:49.286
Sit down, Paul.

25:56.206 --> 25:57.773
It's not going away.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.472
It's not going away!

26:01.603 --> 26:03.083
what's
not going away?

26:03.213 --> 26:04.650
That thing the--

26:05.912 --> 26:08.567
That happened to me
during the Beethoven.

26:08.697 --> 26:10.090
Oh, you know what I remember

26:10.220 --> 26:11.961
from that evening,

26:12.092 --> 26:14.355
is like just what
everyone else remembers,

26:14.485 --> 26:15.791
was that you played marvelously.

26:15.922 --> 26:17.358
Despite the enormous pressure

26:17.488 --> 26:18.838
of a long-awaited return.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.840
-And not only that--
-No!

26:20.970 --> 26:22.798
Yesterday I froze
in front a dozen people,

26:22.929 --> 26:24.234
for God's sake!

26:29.239 --> 26:30.414
I'm sorry.

26:30.545 --> 26:31.415
Oh, no, no, no.

26:33.156 --> 26:34.375
Helen saved me.

26:35.028 --> 26:37.378
-Helen?
-Morrison, the journalist.

26:38.945 --> 26:40.076
I couldn't play.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.035
She saw something was wrong

26:42.165 --> 26:43.645
and she bailed me out.

26:44.646 --> 26:45.473
How?

26:46.779 --> 26:48.607
She sat down beside me

26:48.737 --> 26:49.999
and we played together.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.528
What's wrong with me, Paul?

26:59.922 --> 27:01.620
I know this is
difficult for you.

27:02.185 --> 27:03.796
And it feels real.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.624
And, and, and of course

27:05.754 --> 27:06.799
it is, but...

27:07.800 --> 27:09.889
We all have that
voice inside our head.

27:10.019 --> 27:11.891
I mean, I hear it every day,

27:12.021 --> 27:14.894
that little neurotic bugbear,

27:15.024 --> 27:16.286
"What if?

27:16.896 --> 27:18.245
What if I forget?

27:18.375 --> 27:19.463
What if I miss the shot?

27:20.769 --> 27:21.901
What if I suddenly
turn the steering wheel?"

27:22.858 --> 27:24.991
That's not reality.

27:26.383 --> 27:27.994
You were born
with a gift, Henry.

27:28.864 --> 27:31.954
And you have dedicated
your entire life to it.

27:32.085 --> 27:34.696
And it has been tested

27:35.262 --> 27:36.655
and approved

27:36.785 --> 27:38.526
and unanimously praised.

27:39.092 --> 27:41.050
I mean,
you've played enough scales

27:41.181 --> 27:42.878
and arpeggios and trills

27:43.009 --> 27:45.272
to circle the earth 10 times.

27:45.402 --> 27:48.536
I mean, your whole freaking
brain is wired to make music.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.756
Believe me, it would take
a massive amount of work

27:50.886 --> 27:52.061
to derail all that.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.672
And that is the truth.

27:54.760 --> 27:55.717
So, the next time,

27:56.849 --> 27:58.459
you start imagining things,

27:58.589 --> 27:59.852
I mean, if there is a next time,

27:59.982 --> 28:01.810
you just take a deep breath,

28:03.377 --> 28:05.771
you remember who you are

28:06.293 --> 28:08.687
and you tell that
bugbear to fuck off!

28:33.668 --> 28:35.409
Carol, it's me.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.367
I need Helen
Morrison's phone number.

28:53.209 --> 28:54.167
Hi.

28:54.689 --> 28:55.646
-Sorry.
-Oh.

28:56.256 --> 28:57.083
Hello there.

28:58.171 --> 28:59.215
Am I interrupting?

29:00.086 --> 29:01.696
I, I was,

29:01.827 --> 29:04.917
just complimenting him
on his excellent posture.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.746
Actually,

29:08.877 --> 29:11.227
he reminds me of
my first piano teacher,

29:11.358 --> 29:12.489
Mrs. Groffus.

29:13.273 --> 29:14.665
What is it
with gorillas?

29:15.536 --> 29:16.537
I don't know.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.322
They seem upset about something.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.152
Maybe about
being gorillas.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.764
The curse
of self-knowledge.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.984
Or maybe they're afraid
of death, they're endangered.

29:30.116 --> 29:33.119
Or perhaps they just
don't like being watched.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.951
I can't tell you
how grateful I am,

29:39.081 --> 29:39.865
Sir Henry.

29:39.995 --> 29:40.779
No, please.

29:40.909 --> 29:42.128
Just Henry.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.174
Okay, Henry.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.568
I can't even
remember my last interview.

29:49.483 --> 29:50.484
I remember mine.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.443
He had a heart
attack the next day.

29:54.314 --> 29:56.620
Well, you do ask
difficult questions.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.799
Music is a dangerous business.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.365
People don't realize.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.715
I knew this Spanish singer once,

30:04.846 --> 30:06.021
great mezzo.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.762
She was playing Carmen

30:07.893 --> 30:10.243
in an open-air
production at the Alhambra.

30:10.373 --> 30:12.114
And in the final scene,

30:12.245 --> 30:15.074
as she gasped as
Don Jose stabbed her,

30:15.204 --> 30:17.380
a wasp flew into
her mouth and stung her.

30:17.511 --> 30:18.773
She collapsed,

30:18.904 --> 30:20.949
went into anaphylactic shock.

30:21.558 --> 30:22.472
No.

30:23.604 --> 30:24.561
Nobody really
knew that she was dead

30:24.692 --> 30:26.085
until the third curtain call.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.613
Do you ever think
what your life would've

30:32.743 --> 30:34.833
been had you
done something else?

30:35.703 --> 30:36.922
It wouldn't have been my life.

30:40.621 --> 30:41.883
It must be a great feeling

30:42.014 --> 30:43.450
knowing that
there's nothing arbitrary

30:43.580 --> 30:44.843
about what you do.

30:46.627 --> 30:47.846
Now, I have a friend like that.

30:48.716 --> 30:49.935
He's also a pianist.

30:53.199 --> 30:54.200
He's unique.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.074
Being unique,

30:59.553 --> 31:03.992
is a desirable attribute
for stamps or landscapes.

31:04.123 --> 31:05.472
In a pianist,

31:05.602 --> 31:07.604
it usually spells trouble.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.092
No one plays like you, Henry.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.922
Well, thank you, Ms. Morrison.

31:21.618 --> 31:22.881
It's kind of you to say.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.188
The pianist's
duty is to serve.

31:27.233 --> 31:29.713
His personal contribution

31:29.844 --> 31:32.325
belongs to
the realm of small differences.

31:34.153 --> 31:36.416
That Beethoven
walked the face of the earth,

31:37.460 --> 31:38.679
now that's something.

31:40.463 --> 31:41.290
The, um,

31:42.378 --> 31:44.598
the verse on your car,

31:45.729 --> 31:46.905
where did you find it?

31:49.037 --> 31:50.212
In your book.

31:51.213 --> 31:53.346
It has been out
of print for years.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.001
Do you still write?

32:00.222 --> 32:01.397
Henry?

32:01.528 --> 32:02.311
Mm?

32:04.139 --> 32:06.489
You just seemed
far away for a second.

32:06.620 --> 32:07.969
-I did?
-Yeah.

32:08.448 --> 32:09.275
I'm sorry.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.103
What did you say?

32:19.676 --> 32:22.331
Success often conceals a flaw,

32:22.462 --> 32:23.680
a wound,

32:23.811 --> 32:25.117
some deep-seated doubt.

32:26.553 --> 32:28.294
It might be
forgotten for a while,

32:28.424 --> 32:29.469
but it's always there,

32:30.731 --> 32:32.689
operating in the background,

32:32.820 --> 32:34.561
lurking behind the mask.

33:25.307 --> 33:27.005
Are you sure
you're allowed to do this?

33:27.135 --> 33:29.529
What about your hands?
What if you fall?

33:29.659 --> 33:32.923
Falling has to be
learned at an early age.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.969
And if you're a pianist,

33:35.100 --> 33:36.971
the left side
of the face is best.

33:37.624 --> 33:38.451
Oh.

33:39.452 --> 33:40.279
Thank you.

33:41.889 --> 33:44.892
Usually I wear cycling tights.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.720
I bet you look sexy in them.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.026
I like to think so.

33:48.635 --> 33:49.462
Thank you.

33:52.465 --> 33:53.292
Henry.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.514
All right, lead the way.

33:59.472 --> 34:00.299
Okay.

34:10.222 --> 34:11.614
I'm still
a little shaky.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.279
Do you ever get
lonely up there in your world?

34:25.018 --> 34:26.976
German composers
are good company.

34:28.762 --> 34:29.676
Right.

34:30.893 --> 34:32.547
I couldn't have
survived my teenage years

34:32.679 --> 34:33.723
without Schumann.

34:34.289 --> 34:35.159
I depended on him.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.031
I felt...

34:38.728 --> 34:40.730
he understood me
more than anyone.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.603
And now of course,
not a day goes by without

34:45.387 --> 34:47.824
it's bless by Bach or Beethoven.

34:57.573 --> 34:58.879
I did have somebody.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.975
Prague in spring.

35:09.846 --> 35:11.109
It's,

35:11.239 --> 35:12.675
it's a delightful place.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.244
The sounds,
fragrances, the light...

35:19.552 --> 35:20.901
sparkles with energy.

35:22.032 --> 35:23.817
And everywhere you go, music.

35:28.952 --> 35:30.954
Elizabeth was radiant that day.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.394
We must have walked

35:36.525 --> 35:38.223
nearly five miles

35:38.353 --> 35:41.748
through the Mala Strana
and the old town,

35:42.618 --> 35:44.707
talking and talking and talking

35:45.491 --> 35:48.494
about music
and our life together.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.020
How we were grateful, both of us

35:53.151 --> 35:54.500
for being there.

35:54.630 --> 35:56.284
And, uh, we made plans.

35:57.938 --> 35:59.853
We decided we
would spend more time

35:59.983 --> 36:02.508
in our little farmhouse
in the south of France.

36:03.639 --> 36:05.467
And the next morning
she was gone.

36:10.603 --> 36:12.605
I've never felt
anything so cold.

36:16.913 --> 36:18.306
That's how people die...

36:20.221 --> 36:23.616
while someone else is
eating or opening a window.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.227
Or,

36:27.620 --> 36:29.970
while their companion
is dreaming at their side.

36:38.065 --> 36:40.459
It's one thing you can
say about dead composers,

36:41.199 --> 36:43.026
they don't
suddenly disappear on you.

36:51.774 --> 36:53.341
Oh, God, I must get back.

36:57.824 --> 36:59.173
Um, please...

37:00.305 --> 37:01.306
do you mind?

37:02.307 --> 37:03.177
I, um...

38:58.553 --> 39:00.033
Symphony Hall, sir.

39:00.163 --> 39:01.208
Keep driving.

39:02.992 --> 39:03.906
Just drive.

40:49.359 --> 40:50.970
Henry, you just had
a little memory slip.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.624
You know,
it happens to everyone.

41:03.199 --> 41:05.898
Paul, we both
know I didn't forget.

41:07.987 --> 41:10.468
It's just music,
it's not the 10 Commandments.

41:11.860 --> 41:14.341
How about you use
a score for the second half.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.473
Richter did it.

41:16.212 --> 41:18.476
Slightest nudge
that's all it takes.

41:23.872 --> 41:24.960
Not now, please.

41:26.788 --> 41:28.355
-10 minutes, sir.
- Thank you.

41:30.096 --> 41:32.359
Paul, I'm not
going out there again.

41:33.578 --> 41:34.448
Okay.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.059
Okay, you don't have to.

41:38.626 --> 41:39.497
Okay.

41:52.248 --> 41:53.598
I want you to lie down here.

41:54.468 --> 41:56.122
Close your eyes

41:56.775 --> 41:59.691
and just try to relax.

42:01.867 --> 42:03.433
Don't think about anything just

42:03.564 --> 42:06.001
breathe.

42:07.655 --> 42:09.483
Focus on that, okay?

42:10.702 --> 42:12.747
And, uh, I'll go
find the promoter,

42:13.487 --> 42:14.662
we'll see what we can do.

43:04.190 --> 43:06.366
Helen, there you are, finally.

43:06.496 --> 43:09.674
I'm sorry. They kept us waiting
for like 30 minutes at the gate.

43:09.804 --> 43:11.023
-How's it going?
-Not good.

43:11.545 --> 43:12.764
He doesn't want to continue.

43:12.894 --> 43:14.330
-You have to talk to him.
-What happened?

43:14.461 --> 43:16.245
Everything was fine.
Everything was good

43:16.376 --> 43:18.204
and out of nowhere
he botched the coda.

43:18.944 --> 43:20.032
He's in there.

43:20.162 --> 43:21.424
Please go and see him.

43:21.555 --> 43:22.338
He needs you.

43:23.775 --> 43:25.472
-I'll try but--
-Thanks.

43:25.603 --> 43:26.604
You have five minutes.

43:35.003 --> 43:35.830
Helen!

43:37.353 --> 43:38.703
What are you doing here?

43:39.355 --> 43:40.748
I was in the neighborhood.

43:44.186 --> 43:45.448
I'm happy to see you.

43:51.585 --> 43:53.195
I heard you had a little hiccup.

43:56.938 --> 43:58.853
I don't know
what's happening to me.

43:59.767 --> 44:00.638
I...

44:01.551 --> 44:03.466
I can't keep up.

44:05.294 --> 44:07.514
It's, it's like I am

44:07.645 --> 44:10.169
paddling at
the top of a waterfall.

44:12.388 --> 44:13.302
I'm so sorry.

44:15.783 --> 44:16.654
I feel...

44:17.959 --> 44:19.091
exposed.

44:23.486 --> 44:24.313
Scared.

44:30.189 --> 44:31.451
You're scared.

44:33.801 --> 44:34.672
Okay.

44:36.630 --> 44:38.501
I don't think you
should run from it.

44:39.111 --> 44:40.634
All these people, Henry,

44:42.418 --> 44:44.725
you make them happy, you know?

44:46.727 --> 44:48.729
That's why they
come to hear you play.

44:51.253 --> 44:53.212
So, just play,

44:53.342 --> 44:54.126
Henry.

44:56.476 --> 44:57.738
Play for them.

45:23.764 --> 45:26.332
On the flight
over I sat by the window

45:26.462 --> 45:29.465
brooding, as usual, over
the wiring, the hydraulics

45:29.596 --> 45:32.077
and all those sheets
of metal stitched together

45:32.555 --> 45:35.428
thinking that flying
required a continuous miracle.

45:36.690 --> 45:39.171
But flying is what
a plane does of course.

45:39.301 --> 45:42.522
The real miracle is
that I can still
torment myself like this.

45:46.874 --> 45:49.442
Sometimes you just
have to let it fly.

45:58.233 --> 46:00.061
You deserve
these more than I do.

46:05.763 --> 46:06.633
Helen...

46:08.722 --> 46:09.549
thank you.

46:12.291 --> 46:13.074
Yes?

46:13.205 --> 46:14.336
Oh, hello there.

46:14.467 --> 46:16.121
You must be Daniel.

46:16.251 --> 46:18.427
I'm, I'm glad to see you.
Come on in.

46:19.037 --> 46:20.821
Daniel, this is Helen.

46:21.474 --> 46:23.911
And, uh, this is
Daniel's mother, Maya.

46:24.869 --> 46:26.522
So, your mother tells me

46:26.653 --> 46:28.916
that you are
quite a music lover.

46:29.047 --> 46:29.830
Do you play?

46:30.918 --> 46:32.006
I want to be like you.

46:33.312 --> 46:34.182
Is that right?

46:37.577 --> 46:38.404
Well, thank you.

46:39.231 --> 46:40.623
You've just made my day.

46:41.668 --> 46:42.800
Do you play these?

46:45.759 --> 46:47.761
I find them awfully difficult.

46:48.240 --> 46:49.502
I can play the second one.

46:49.981 --> 46:51.504
A little bit.

46:51.634 --> 46:52.461
Really?

46:52.984 --> 46:54.812
I would love to hear you play.

46:55.290 --> 46:56.857
Mrs. Walker
says I'm not allowed.

46:57.379 --> 46:58.816
Is she your piano teacher?

47:00.295 --> 47:02.776
I think that Mrs. Walker

47:02.907 --> 47:05.474
would be happy to make
an exception for tonight.

47:06.606 --> 47:07.650
Come with me.

47:08.129 --> 47:09.043
One minute.

47:12.917 --> 47:16.355
Some pianists think
that walking on stage

47:16.485 --> 47:19.184
is the scariest
part of the evening

47:19.314 --> 47:20.141
and they're right.

47:33.807 --> 47:34.634
Okay.

47:36.027 --> 47:36.854
Come.

47:39.508 --> 47:40.335
Uh...

47:41.771 --> 47:46.733
before sitting down
a pianist must smile

47:47.386 --> 47:48.517
and bow,

47:48.648 --> 47:50.737
but modestly because

47:51.346 --> 47:52.870
he hasn't earned it yet.

48:00.921 --> 48:01.748
Good.

48:02.575 --> 48:03.532
Take a seat.

48:52.799 --> 48:54.627
- What do you think?
- Pretty.

48:57.673 --> 48:58.500
For me?

49:13.602 --> 49:14.734
You smell like chlorine.

49:16.388 --> 49:18.781
It's common for
people of my age.

49:20.305 --> 49:22.089
I'm sorry,
tell me your name again.

49:22.220 --> 49:23.003
I'm Jessie.

49:23.134 --> 49:24.091
Ah, I'm Henry.

49:28.443 --> 49:31.794
How do you keep such
good concentration, Jessie?

49:41.979 --> 49:44.068
A smile,
Sir Henry, please.

49:46.070 --> 49:48.028
Why don't we
just use a Kandinsky

49:48.724 --> 49:50.248
or Frank Stella.

49:50.378 --> 49:51.162
Perfect.

49:54.078 --> 49:56.297
No, the other hand
was good, on top.

49:56.428 --> 49:57.820
The other one
can be on it, though.

49:58.647 --> 49:59.474
Other way round.

50:01.259 --> 50:02.260
Thank you.

50:02.956 --> 50:05.959
And if you could
look at us. Please.

50:06.090 --> 50:07.700
No, I think I, I like him

50:07.830 --> 50:09.223
being like that, it's nice.

50:14.794 --> 50:15.708
All right.

50:18.232 --> 50:19.059
Jessie...

50:20.278 --> 50:21.540
come.

50:21.670 --> 50:22.454
Come.

50:31.115 --> 50:32.377
What's he doing?

50:49.481 --> 50:52.092
There's a signed picture
of Eisenhower in the bathroom.

50:52.745 --> 50:54.529
He was a musical president.

50:54.660 --> 50:55.965
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

50:59.491 --> 51:01.884
What makes you write, Helen?

51:03.886 --> 51:06.324
You said the ability
to feel is what matters.

51:06.976 --> 51:08.500
I agree.

51:08.630 --> 51:10.763
But unless I put
words to those feelings,

51:10.893 --> 51:13.548
I don't exactly
know what they mean.

51:16.812 --> 51:17.639
What they are.

51:18.640 --> 51:19.946
So writing, I guess,

51:21.078 --> 51:23.645
it helps me understand myself...

51:25.212 --> 51:26.083
my life.

51:27.432 --> 51:28.955
How's that working out?

51:32.393 --> 51:33.916
I still have more writing to do.

51:37.790 --> 51:41.228
This place used to
be called the 341 Club.

51:41.837 --> 51:45.232
Every week, for one hour,
the stage belonged to

51:45.363 --> 51:47.887
a young graduate
student of mathematics

51:48.017 --> 51:49.845
with a gift for improvisation.

51:52.021 --> 51:53.588
People used to say that

51:53.719 --> 51:56.939
my father could
pluck music out of thin air,

51:57.070 --> 52:00.465
so complete that
it was hard to believe

52:00.595 --> 52:02.162
that nobody had
ever thought of it before.

52:03.729 --> 52:05.034
His biggest night came

52:06.601 --> 52:09.474
when he was asked to accompany
a young singer from Paris.

52:33.324 --> 52:35.413
They fell in love,
he took her back to England,

52:36.805 --> 52:37.719
I was born.

52:39.156 --> 52:43.160
After a few years,
I became too much for her.

52:43.290 --> 52:46.859
She wasn't cut out
to enter ordinary life.

52:47.425 --> 52:49.166
So, I was sent
to boarding school.

52:49.905 --> 52:51.777
My father got a job in New York.

52:52.386 --> 52:53.387
She went with him.

52:53.518 --> 52:54.910
I was left behind.

52:55.824 --> 52:56.999
When I got into high school,

52:57.565 --> 52:58.436
I came back here.

53:00.264 --> 53:01.656
And that first summer

53:01.787 --> 53:02.962
we went to Cape Cod.

53:05.399 --> 53:09.664
There was long walks on
the beaches with my parents.

53:13.712 --> 53:15.192
It's strange how...

53:17.019 --> 53:18.630
a single good memory

53:19.152 --> 53:22.068
can sometimes erase
years of bad ones.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.387
Baseball.

54:22.389 --> 54:23.695
You know the name of this team?

54:24.261 --> 54:26.654
They're called the Orioles.

54:26.785 --> 54:27.699
I love that name.

54:28.482 --> 54:30.049
I know the Orioles

54:30.441 --> 54:32.660
and the Cardinals and the Cubs.

54:32.791 --> 54:33.922
And all the other critters.

54:36.403 --> 54:38.579
You think you're the only
pianist who likes baseball?

54:40.320 --> 54:41.495
Someone told me once,

54:42.017 --> 54:44.585
that whenever Horowitz

54:44.716 --> 54:46.848
was under pressure
from his wife, Wanda,

54:46.979 --> 54:50.025
to perform his conjugal duties,

54:50.635 --> 54:52.854
he used to take her to
Yankee Stadium.

54:53.551 --> 54:54.639
Where did you hear that?

54:54.769 --> 54:56.728
Oh, from Vladimir himself.

54:56.858 --> 54:58.469
No way.

54:58.599 --> 55:00.558
So, how is the article going?

55:01.602 --> 55:02.647
Is it any good?

55:04.388 --> 55:06.041
I don't know,
I haven't finished it yet.

55:06.172 --> 55:08.740
Well, I'm really
looking forward to it.

55:09.306 --> 55:10.132
And...

55:11.220 --> 55:12.439
You will show
it to me, won't you?

55:13.484 --> 55:15.921
I mean, I know
that's not customary but, uh...

55:17.923 --> 55:19.881
as it's about me, uh.

55:20.969 --> 55:22.493
Well, that would
ruin the surprise,

55:22.623 --> 55:23.450
wouldn't it?

55:24.364 --> 55:25.191
Precisely.

56:24.816 --> 56:26.774
I leave for
Europe in a few days.

56:29.429 --> 56:30.256
I know.

56:36.436 --> 56:37.350
Come with me?

56:38.525 --> 56:40.353
I mean, if you can.

56:40.484 --> 56:41.267
If...

56:42.224 --> 56:43.225
if you want to.

56:46.403 --> 56:47.578
I'd like that.

57:58.692 --> 58:01.042
The classical market is
a lot like the wine market.

58:01.739 --> 58:03.305
It survives

58:03.436 --> 58:06.483
by creating the illusion
of meaningful diversity.

58:07.527 --> 58:09.573
There will always be the demand

58:09.703 --> 58:11.662
for the opportunity
to distinguish oneself

58:11.792 --> 58:14.273
by pretending to see a world

58:14.403 --> 58:15.796
where others see nothing.

58:16.797 --> 58:18.190
Sometimes there
really is a world.

58:18.669 --> 58:20.540
Well, the fact that
you perceive a difference

58:20.671 --> 58:22.803
doesn't necessarily make
that difference meaningful.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.850
Are you
calling me a snob?

58:25.980 --> 58:27.721
No! No!

58:28.592 --> 58:31.464
Oh, but seriously. Do we
actually need another recording

58:31.595 --> 58:33.248
of "The Goldberg Variations"?

58:33.379 --> 58:35.250
- Or another
pianist maybe?

58:35.381 --> 58:36.730
Yeah, exactly.

58:36.861 --> 58:38.123
Sturgeon's law,

58:38.253 --> 58:41.300
90% of everything is crap.

58:41.866 --> 58:43.868
-That's a lot.
-Yes!

58:43.998 --> 58:46.261
Did you know you were
managed by the enemy, Henry?

58:46.392 --> 58:49.177
So long as he
keeps getting me gigs,

58:49.656 --> 58:51.789
I'll let the philistine
speak his mind.

58:55.314 --> 58:56.402
Can I give you a hand?

58:57.142 --> 58:58.447
Oh, no, I got it.

58:59.797 --> 59:01.886
Most pianists can't boil an egg.

59:02.016 --> 59:04.105
-Did you know that?
-Well, I used to be a pianist,

59:04.236 --> 59:05.542
just so you're warned.

59:05.672 --> 59:07.108
Oh.

59:09.371 --> 59:11.635
I can't tell
you how much it means

59:12.940 --> 59:14.376
to Henry for you to be here.

59:16.204 --> 59:17.466
It's everything, actually.

59:18.903 --> 59:21.427
After his wife died he barely
spoke for two years.

59:22.210 --> 59:24.212
Let alone give recitals

59:24.343 --> 59:25.431
or even go near the piano.

59:26.432 --> 59:27.433
What was she like?

59:29.304 --> 59:30.305
She was beautiful,

59:31.393 --> 59:32.612
graceful, smart.

59:35.049 --> 59:37.574
There was
something moving about her.

59:38.879 --> 59:40.098
You know, she didn't
go out much.

59:40.228 --> 59:41.882
Pretty much depended on him.

59:42.013 --> 59:43.362
That made things difficult.

59:44.363 --> 59:46.408
He couldn't have
cared for her more.

59:47.366 --> 59:48.889
He'd constantly look after her.

59:50.021 --> 59:51.631
He played fewer recitals.

59:52.153 --> 59:53.546
Canceled at the last minute,

59:54.765 --> 59:55.940
when, uh,

59:56.070 --> 59:57.332
she didn't feel well.

59:58.159 --> 59:59.508
He did everything he could.

01:00:00.335 --> 01:00:01.423
She took her life anyway.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:06.820
You didn't know?

01:00:11.738 --> 01:00:13.610
I shouldn't be surprised.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.654
Nobody does.

01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:17.570
He's still protecting her,
I guess.

01:00:19.441 --> 01:00:20.399
She had tried it,

01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:23.794
once before, actually,
when he was on tour.

01:00:25.404 --> 01:00:26.579
That's why this time he decided

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.102
to take her to Europe with him.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:33.499
She used his sleeping pills.

01:00:39.461 --> 01:00:41.420
The concert in London,

01:00:41.986 --> 01:00:44.466
there has never been
anything like it.

01:00:47.078 --> 01:00:49.428
It will be an exclamation point
to his career.

01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:52.649
I hope so.

01:00:57.436 --> 01:00:58.567
Yeah.

01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:00.395
- Merci.
-Okay.

01:01:00.526 --> 01:01:02.659
This is somewhat experimental.

01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:05.487
I got the recipe
from an Ian McEwan novel.

01:01:05.618 --> 01:01:08.447
Why not? I once learned how to
milk a camel from Hemingway.

01:01:08.577 --> 01:01:11.755
-Now that could come in
handy with global warming.

01:01:11.885 --> 01:01:13.582
You never know

01:01:13.713 --> 01:01:15.280
-Paul?
-Yes, please.

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:18.979
You know one of the few
good things about getting old?

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:19.893
Uh-oh.

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:25.943
You become a pragmatist.

01:01:26.552 --> 01:01:29.424
You're not
searching for meaning anymore.

01:01:29.555 --> 01:01:32.863
You're just
searching for words or sleep

01:01:32.993 --> 01:01:36.301
or the reason you're
staring into an open drawer.

01:01:36.431 --> 01:01:39.173
And you're not worried
about the future just...

01:01:40.566 --> 01:01:43.221
you want the present to last.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.093
The heart and the mind

01:01:47.312 --> 01:01:48.356
finally get along.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.098
Anyway.

01:01:51.229 --> 01:01:52.621
What I wanted to say was,

01:01:53.405 --> 01:01:56.582
I'm so happy to
see all of you here.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:57.975
-Cheers.
-SantÃ©.

01:01:58.105 --> 01:02:00.804
-SantÃ©.

01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:03.589
Bon AppÃ©tit.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.721
Bon AppÃ©tit.

01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:13.294
- Well. Hmm.
-Hmm.

01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:15.775
-This is interesting.

01:02:15.906 --> 01:02:17.298
Oh, yes, I see.

01:02:18.473 --> 01:02:20.693
What did you say
that novel was about again?

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.651
Is there something wrong?

01:02:22.782 --> 01:02:25.350
It's just
a simple bouillabaisse.

01:02:25.916 --> 01:02:27.613
-Richard?

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:29.484
- Francine?

01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:32.009
It... it's hard to describe.

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:35.708
-Fish certainly comes to mind.

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:37.579
And a Wagner.

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:39.059
- Wagner.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:40.887
-Rienzi.

01:02:41.018 --> 01:02:43.368
-It's that bad?
-No, no.

01:02:43.498 --> 01:02:47.851
-It, it, it's just a little
difficult to swallow,

01:02:47.981 --> 01:02:49.896
the first time around, you know.

01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:54.161
-No, actually, it's terrible.
-Oh, it's that bad!

01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:55.989
-It's that bad!

01:02:58.252 --> 01:02:59.688
I don't know
what happened.

01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:01.647
I must have missed
a chapter or something.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.954
-What should we do, Henry?
-Do you have a camel?

01:03:04.084 --> 01:03:06.478
-Well, monsieur.

01:03:07.522 --> 01:03:09.960
I have some tomatoes.
I can make a tomato salad.

01:03:28.282 --> 01:03:30.458
I'd really like to
come with you to Turin.

01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:33.374
A deadline is a deadline.

01:03:34.593 --> 01:03:35.420
Plus,

01:03:36.638 --> 01:03:38.771
you know, I think
it will be good for me

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:40.555
to do one on my own.

01:03:41.121 --> 01:03:42.514
And I'm ready. I'm...

01:03:43.558 --> 01:03:45.038
Nothing to worry about.

01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:53.655
"Sir Henry, recognized
by piano aficionados

01:03:53.786 --> 01:03:55.744
as a master of sound and nuance,

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:57.398
is widely considered

01:03:57.529 --> 01:04:00.662
one of the greatest
virtuosi of the 20th century.

01:04:00.793 --> 01:04:04.797
Proceeds from the tour
will be donated to the Nona
Center for Mental Health."

01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:10.063
Virtuosi or virtuosos?

01:04:10.977 --> 01:04:12.022
I think both are correct.

01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:13.458
Oh.

01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:21.596
The Nona Center, that your idea?

01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:26.036
There's nothing
worse than losing your mind.

01:04:32.956 --> 01:04:35.219
Do you remember
the story I told you about

01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:36.176
the Swiss Alps?

01:04:37.656 --> 01:04:38.526
Oh, yes.

01:04:39.745 --> 01:04:40.833
Something else
happened when I was there.

01:04:42.095 --> 01:04:43.270
I had a boyfriend at the time,

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.316
a pianist from Ukraine.

01:04:45.446 --> 01:04:46.883
-The unique one.
-Right.

01:04:48.797 --> 01:04:51.452
He's the reason I went
to Switzerland, actually.

01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:53.759
Every summer
he plays there, just

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.022
one concert at
a hotel in the Upper Engadine.

01:04:56.675 --> 01:04:58.503
People come from all over

01:04:59.069 --> 01:05:02.072
just to hear him play
Beethoven's last piano sonatas.

01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:05.902
He never plays
them anywhere else.

01:05:06.424 --> 01:05:08.905
- Why not?
- He feels that
that place

01:05:09.035 --> 01:05:11.037
and that music belong together.

01:05:12.343 --> 01:05:13.474
That's odd.

01:05:13.605 --> 01:05:15.128
I thought so too.

01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:17.522
Until I went.

01:05:20.655 --> 01:05:21.482
And?

01:05:24.181 --> 01:05:27.662
I had worked so damn hard
for that competition

01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:28.576
and I failed

01:05:29.621 --> 01:05:31.231
in such a way that...

01:05:34.147 --> 01:05:35.409
the dream was over.

01:05:37.846 --> 01:05:39.674
I didn't know where to go,

01:05:39.805 --> 01:05:41.241
who I was,

01:05:41.372 --> 01:05:42.895
where to turn to.

01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:49.206
I didn't even know where
to begin to look for answers.

01:05:49.336 --> 01:05:51.512
But all that
was suddenly appeased

01:05:51.643 --> 01:05:56.474
by a few wistful bars
of absolute tenderness

01:05:57.475 --> 01:05:58.867
and understanding.

01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:02.262
It was like waking up
from a bad dream.

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:06.484
Suddenly,
the fog had just lifted.

01:06:10.096 --> 01:06:12.142
And that feeling
stayed with me for days.

01:06:13.447 --> 01:06:14.883
It just opened me up.

01:06:18.278 --> 01:06:19.323
Invigorated me.

01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:23.805
It's like when
I heard you play, Henry.

01:06:25.938 --> 01:06:28.549
Well, I could use
some invigoration myself.

01:06:31.509 --> 01:06:32.989
He's playing there next month.

01:06:33.598 --> 01:06:34.512
Let's go together.

01:06:35.861 --> 01:06:36.993
You won't regret it.

01:06:38.211 --> 01:06:39.430
It will be good for you.

01:06:40.431 --> 01:06:41.258
How so?

01:06:43.564 --> 01:06:44.739
I don't know, just a feeling.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.898
All right then.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.595
Do you have everything you need?

01:07:15.205 --> 01:07:19.992
Yes, I've got my toothbrush,
my Advil, my lucky socks.

01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:21.733
I'm all set.

01:07:30.002 --> 01:07:32.831
I am an old man.

01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:37.053
What's the matter,
you have something against

01:07:37.183 --> 01:07:38.141
younger women?

01:07:40.491 --> 01:07:41.318
No.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.547
I'll be listening.

01:07:54.635 --> 01:07:56.028
I'll be playing for you.

01:08:01.468 --> 01:08:02.513
I love you, Henry.

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:08.055
Perhaps
what eternal recurrence means

01:09:08.187 --> 01:09:11.973
is not that our life will actually repeat itself forever,

01:09:12.104 --> 01:09:14.237
but rather that
we should not rest content

01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:15.760
until we have reached a point

01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:16.935
where we love it enough

01:09:17.064 --> 01:09:18.154
just as it is,

01:09:18.283 --> 01:09:19.807
to wish it were indeed so.

01:09:23.636 --> 01:09:25.377
Play it again, I say.

01:13:02.595 --> 01:13:05.206
Excuse me, sir,
there is somebody who
wants to talk to you.

01:13:05.337 --> 01:13:06.730
He says it's urgent.

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:07.644
Who is it?

01:13:13.998 --> 01:13:14.825
Ah.

01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:17.044
How did you find me?

01:13:18.002 --> 01:13:18.959
I'm your agent.

01:13:20.091 --> 01:13:21.397
It's good to see you, Henry.

01:13:21.832 --> 01:13:23.616
It's really good
to hear your voice.

01:13:25.357 --> 01:13:26.184
How are you?

01:13:27.446 --> 01:13:30.101
Fate doesn't
approve of convertibles.

01:13:31.015 --> 01:13:32.277
Did you know that?

01:13:34.497 --> 01:13:35.323
Paul...

01:13:37.804 --> 01:13:40.024
I won't be
needing an agent anymore.

01:13:41.025 --> 01:13:42.983
Don't say that.
Give yourself some time.

01:13:45.595 --> 01:13:47.031
You've always been good to me.

01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:49.512
I couldn't have asked
for a better agent

01:13:49.642 --> 01:13:51.078
or a better friend.

01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:52.993
But my time is up.

01:13:53.385 --> 01:13:55.518
Henry, Henry, people love you.

01:13:56.127 --> 01:13:58.782
Do you have any idea
how many letters and emails
I answered for you--

01:13:58.912 --> 01:14:00.131
You didn't cancel London.

01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:04.091
I canceled everything else.

01:14:04.222 --> 01:14:06.093
But this one, there's never been
anything like it.

01:14:06.659 --> 01:14:08.531
I mean, so many people
are looking forward to it,

01:14:08.661 --> 01:14:09.923
so many young people.

01:14:11.882 --> 01:14:13.971
You could dedicate it to her.

01:14:14.885 --> 01:14:16.539
Play through the pain,

01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:18.018
like, lay it out there.

01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:19.759
You'd not only be giving
them music,

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:22.153
you'd be giving them
courage and hope.

01:14:22.283 --> 01:14:23.067
It's over.

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:27.724
Look, I understand. You can stay
there as long as you like,

01:14:27.854 --> 01:14:29.595
-I'll take care of everything.
-Goodbye, Paul.

01:14:30.727 --> 01:14:32.990
-Henry?

01:16:02.122 --> 01:16:04.472
Most people
want to overcome something.

01:16:05.909 --> 01:16:07.388
Until they don't anymore.

01:16:11.001 --> 01:16:14.352
Hopefully, overcoming isn't
just a matter of will,

01:16:14.482 --> 01:16:17.137
but what life does
naturally with time...

01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:20.227
if you're lucky.

01:20:05.278 --> 01:20:06.845
One of my favorite poems.

01:20:08.281 --> 01:20:10.022
It began as
a graffiti, you know.

01:20:10.718 --> 01:20:13.765
Goethe scribbled it on
the wall of a hunter's cabin.

01:20:15.419 --> 01:20:17.116
Some people find it sad.

01:20:17.769 --> 01:20:19.858
I think it's rather soothing.

01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:25.037
What keeps you
awake at night, Felix?

01:20:26.865 --> 01:20:28.040
I am the night porter.

01:20:30.347 --> 01:20:32.392
Didn't you show me
to my room the other day?

01:20:32.523 --> 01:20:34.655
Yes, I requested the privilege.

01:20:36.701 --> 01:20:38.964
My wife and I used to
run a small pension

01:20:39.095 --> 01:20:40.096
here in the valley.

01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:43.969
Welcoming new guests
was what I enjoyed most.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:48.321
Of course, we never had one
quite like yourself.

01:20:51.194 --> 01:20:53.718
May I ask what
brings you to Sils?

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:00.943
A dear friend...

01:21:01.944 --> 01:21:04.337
felt I could use the fresh air.

01:21:08.602 --> 01:21:11.344
Well, you must have
rounds to finish, Felix.

01:21:12.519 --> 01:21:13.999
Can I bring you anything, sir?

01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:15.696
No, I'm fine, thank you.

01:21:17.133 --> 01:21:18.308
It's always a treat

01:21:18.438 --> 01:21:20.397
when an insomniac
checks in the hotel.

01:21:20.527 --> 01:21:22.747
Hmm. Good night, Felix.

01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:24.444
Good night, sir.

01:21:41.157 --> 01:21:42.506
I love you, Henry.

01:24:26.844 --> 01:24:28.628
My wife loved this piece.

01:24:57.744 --> 01:24:58.876
Your move, I think.

01:25:05.926 --> 01:25:06.753
Check.

01:25:09.452 --> 01:25:10.714
Shit.

01:25:12.846 --> 01:25:14.239
That's not possible.

01:25:15.893 --> 01:25:16.981
My queen.

01:25:21.507 --> 01:25:23.205
How did I not see this?

01:25:49.231 --> 01:25:52.538
There's no shame
in conceding, Felix.

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.368
You see, at this point

01:25:56.499 --> 01:25:58.457
it's like, the reasonable
thing to do

01:25:58.588 --> 01:25:59.806
is what I would do.

01:26:03.636 --> 01:26:04.463
What?

01:26:08.859 --> 01:26:09.686
Check.

01:26:11.122 --> 01:26:12.036
Huh.

01:26:20.131 --> 01:26:20.958
Check.

01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:34.232
Oh, no, no, no.

01:26:34.363 --> 01:26:35.494
Can't be.

01:26:35.625 --> 01:26:37.496
Felix.  No.

01:26:41.152 --> 01:26:42.371
Are you okay, maestro?

01:26:47.114 --> 01:26:48.028
Yes.

01:26:48.159 --> 01:26:49.856
Yes, I'm fine, Felix.

01:26:49.987 --> 01:26:52.598
-That was quite some move.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.428
You dropped me
straight to the canvas.

01:27:12.314 --> 01:27:14.838
We never know
what's coming, do we?

01:28:01.972 --> 01:28:03.713
It's been
said that over the music

01:28:03.843 --> 01:28:05.845
of Beethoven is spread
the twilight

01:28:05.976 --> 01:28:07.934
of eternal loss
and eternal hope.

01:28:13.026 --> 01:28:15.028
The same goes for life,
I suppose.

01:28:16.378 --> 01:28:17.901
Except for the eternal part.

01:28:21.687 --> 01:28:24.516
German composers
are good company.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.228
It's
hard to explain how I felt

01:32:18.358 --> 01:32:20.273
as Henry Cole played that night.

01:32:20.926 --> 01:32:22.798
What does great music feel like?

01:32:23.625 --> 01:32:26.366
Like a form of knowledge,
maybe, or even wisdom?

01:32:27.019 --> 01:32:28.499
But it isn't wisdom of course,

01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:30.849
nor anything else
I can put into words.

01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:33.199
The best I can do is to say

01:32:33.330 --> 01:32:34.810
that it's somehow about

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:36.812
what it feels like to be alive.

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:40.772
That music was
filled with grief and longing

01:32:40.903 --> 01:32:42.469
and dogged resolve.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:45.516
And as I listened,
I felt suddenly richer,

01:32:45.647 --> 01:32:47.300
more compassionate.

01:32:47.431 --> 01:32:50.042
And I wanted to share the moment with the whole world.

01:32:51.522 --> 01:32:54.220
I guess the word
I'm looking for is gratitude.

01:32:55.047 --> 01:32:58.964
Gratitude for
Schumann, Bach, Beethoven.

01:32:59.617 --> 01:33:01.358
Gratitude for Henry Cole

01:33:01.488 --> 01:33:04.709
and all those who
celebrate the music of life.
