WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:04.233
- HEY.

00:04.233 --> 00:06.533
- HI, ROBERT.
- HEY.

00:06.533 --> 00:08.167
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU GOT ME ANYTHING

00:08.167 --> 00:09.600
FOR MY BIRTHDAY YET, BUT--

00:09.600 --> 00:11.300
- WELL, I WAS GONNA
BUY YOU A HAT,

00:11.300 --> 00:12.867
BUT EVERY TIME
I TOLD THEM YOUR HEAD SIZE,

00:12.867 --> 00:15.500
THEY'D HANG UP ON ME.

00:19.900 --> 00:22.200
- TERRIFIC.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.467
NO, ALL I WANT THIS YEAR
IS THE PEACE OF MIND

00:24.467 --> 00:28.100
OF KNOWING THAT YOU AND YOURS
ARE SECURE IN YOUR OWN HOME.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.400
- WHAT?

00:29.400 --> 00:31.200
- YOU ARE LOOKING
AT THE NEWEST SALES REP

00:31.200 --> 00:34.867
FOR CASTLEDOOR
HOME SECURITY SYSTEMS.

00:34.867 --> 00:37.267
I'M GONNA BE MOONLIGHTING
A FEW HOURS A WEEK.

00:37.267 --> 00:39.000
- REALLY?
- YEAH, I THOUGHT I'D TRY

00:39.000 --> 00:40.500
TO BRING HOME
A LITTLE EXTRA CASH.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.333
- OH, WELL,
THAT'S GREAT, ROBERT.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.900
- CASTLEDOOR--
THAT'S THE AD WITH THE...

00:43.900 --> 00:47.400
THE KING SLAMMIN' THE GATE
ON THE MASKED ROBBER?

00:47.400 --> 00:51.633
- YEAH.
KING SAFE-N-SOUND.

00:51.633 --> 00:55.600
SO, I, UH, COULDN'T HELP
BUT NOTICING THAT, UH,

00:55.600 --> 01:00.167
YOU GUYS DON'T CURRENTLY
HAVE A HOME SECURITY SYSTEM.

01:00.167 --> 01:01.300
- [groans]

01:01.300 --> 01:03.133
UH-HUH, OKAY,
HERE WE GO.

01:03.133 --> 01:05.433
- [clears throat]

01:07.200 --> 01:11.033
IN TODAY'S WORLD,
IT IS A SAD FACT

01:11.033 --> 01:14.133
THAT MOST
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:14.133 --> 01:16.400
CAN'T SEEM TO RESPOND
TO AN EMERGENCY

01:16.400 --> 01:18.833
AS QUICKLY
AS ONE WOULD HOPE...

01:18.833 --> 01:24.767
SOMETIMES...NOT AT ALL.

01:27.133 --> 01:30.400
- YOU DO KNOW
YOU'RE A POLICEMAN, RIGHT?

01:30.400 --> 01:34.233
- WELL, RESEARCH SHOWS
THAT WHEN A WOULD-BE INTRUDER

01:34.233 --> 01:37.700
SEES THE CASTLEDOOR SIGN
POSTED ON THE FRONT LAWN...

01:37.700 --> 01:39.767
HE MOVES ON.

01:39.767 --> 01:44.333
- SOLD.
WE'LL TAKE ONE OF THOSE SIGNS.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.300
- IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.633
- WELL, BUT IF THE GUY
DOESN'T LOOK--

01:47.633 --> 01:50.533
- DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY,
RAYMOND!

01:53.567 --> 01:56.200
- LISTEN, ROBERT, I MEAN,
I KNOW CRIME IS BAD,

01:56.200 --> 01:58.367
BUT DO WE REALLY
WANT TO LIVE THIS WAY,

01:58.367 --> 01:59.767
YOU KNOW,
ALWAYS BEING AFRAID,

01:59.767 --> 02:01.500
HIDING BEHIND AN ALARM?

02:20.233 --> 02:24.300
WE'LL TAKE THIS ONE.

02:25.533 --> 02:28.233
- OKAY, SO YOU
COULD SET THE DOOR ALARMS,

02:28.233 --> 02:31.067
OR THE MOTION SENSORS,
OR BOTH AT ONCE.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.433
IT'S UP TO YOU.

02:32.433 --> 02:35.467
YOU SEE, WITH CASTLEDOOR,
YOU'RE THE KING.

02:37.767 --> 02:39.000
- I DON'T NEED AN ALARM

02:39.000 --> 02:41.067
TO SCARE AWAY CROOKS
FROM MY HOME.

02:41.067 --> 02:43.400
I KEEP AN OLD BAT FOR THAT.

02:45.067 --> 02:48.700
- YOU BETTER WATCH IT, FRANK.
ROBERT'S VERY PERSUASIVE.

02:48.700 --> 02:49.667
THIS IS HIS FIFTH SALE,

02:49.667 --> 02:51.300
AND HE'S ONLY BEEN AT IT
A WEEK.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.667
- ACTUALLY, I HAD
AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION

02:53.667 --> 02:55.067
WITH MY BOSS TODAY.

02:55.067 --> 02:58.800
- KING SAFE-N-SOUND?

02:58.800 --> 03:01.267
- NO, HIS SON RICKY.

03:01.267 --> 03:03.500
AND HE SAID HE'S LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY FULL-TIME,

03:03.500 --> 03:05.733
AND HE WOULD LOVE
FOR ME TO COME ABOARD.

03:05.733 --> 03:06.900
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.167
AND I BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT.

03:08.167 --> 03:11.400
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:11.400 --> 03:13.667
- YOU MEAN RETIRE
FROM THE FORCE?

03:13.667 --> 03:16.067
- OH!
WONDERFUL!

03:16.067 --> 03:18.300
OH, ROBBIE.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.133
HOW LONG HAVE I WANTED
TO GET YOU INTO

03:20.133 --> 03:22.533
A SAFE, NORMAL JOB, HONEY?

03:22.533 --> 03:23.833
HOW LONG?

03:23.833 --> 03:25.433
- OH, A LONG TIME, MA.

03:25.433 --> 03:27.400
- OH, YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

03:27.400 --> 03:31.133
I WANT TO HAVE YOUR BIRTHDAY
AT OUR HOUSE THIS YEAR.

03:31.133 --> 03:33.667
I'LL MAKE A BIG PARTY.
- WAIT, MARIE.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.167
ROBERT,
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED

03:35.167 --> 03:36.567
TO HEAR YOU TALKING
ABOUT RETIREMENT.

03:36.567 --> 03:38.467
- WHY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:38.467 --> 03:41.267
- MARIE, I KNOW THE JOB
CAN BE DANGEROUS.

03:41.267 --> 03:42.467
I WANT HIM TO BE SAFE.

03:42.467 --> 03:44.600
BUT I ALSO WANT HIM
TO BE HAPPY.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.400
ROBERT, YOU LOVE BEING
A POLICE OFFICER.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.333
- WELL, SURE, I DO, SWEETIE.
YOU KNOW THAT.

03:49.333 --> 03:52.033
IT'S JUST...

03:52.033 --> 03:54.033
WHAT DOES
EVERYBODY ELSE THINK?

03:54.033 --> 03:55.800
- I THINK
YOU SHOULD RETIRE NOW.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.900
I MEAN, WE CAN'T HAVE
POLICEMEN RUNNING AROUND

03:58.900 --> 04:00.500
THAT ARE FRANK'S AGE.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.667
- I'LL FIGHT
ANY ONE OF YOU NOW.

04:09.767 --> 04:10.933
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:10.933 --> 04:12.333
I THINK
IT'S A BIG DECISION,

04:12.333 --> 04:15.800
AND YOU SHOULD GO HOME
AND MAKE IT YOURSELF.

04:15.800 --> 04:20.133
- YEAH, HEY, MAYBE
EVERYBODY SHOULD GO HOME.

04:20.133 --> 04:24.233
- ROBERT, YOU'VE ALWAYS SAID
THAT WEARING THAT UNIFORM

04:24.233 --> 04:26.400
GIVES YOU
SUCH SELF-CONFIDENCE.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.900
YOU KNOW HOW EVERY DAY
YOU PUT ON THAT BADGE

04:28.900 --> 04:33.567
AND SQUAT DOWN TO LOOK
AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR.

04:33.567 --> 04:36.733
- BUT HE'S SUCH
A GREAT ALARM SALESMAN.

04:36.733 --> 04:40.233
YOU HEARD WHAT
RICKY SAFE-N-SOUND SAID.

04:40.233 --> 04:41.933
- MARIE, PLEASE.

04:41.933 --> 04:44.467
- I'M JUST TALKING.

04:44.467 --> 04:46.233
SINCE WHEN IS THERE A LAW

04:46.233 --> 04:48.533
AGAINST ME
EXPRESSING MY FEELINGS?

04:48.533 --> 04:53.567
- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PASS
THAT LEGISLATION FOR YEARS.

04:56.733 --> 04:59.700
- MARIE, YOU CAN SAY
HOW YOU FEEL,

04:59.700 --> 05:02.300
BUT I'M ALSO SAYING
HOW I FEEL.

05:02.300 --> 05:05.100
- AND YOU FEEL THAT ROBERT
SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.667
- ROBERT HAS BEEN LISTENING
TO YOU.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.433
I THINK MAYBE
THAT'S WHY HE'S TALKING ABOUT

05:08.433 --> 05:11.800
RETIRING SO EARLY--
TO MAKEYOUHAPPY.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.133
- THAT IS NOT TRUE.

05:13.133 --> 05:14.333
IS THAT TRUE, ROBBIE?

05:14.333 --> 05:15.833
TELL HER IT'S NOT TRUE.

05:15.833 --> 05:17.933
TELL HER RIGHT NOW.

05:17.933 --> 05:20.167
TELL HER.

05:20.167 --> 05:21.333
- I DON'T KNOW.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.033
IT'S--IT'S, UH...

05:23.033 --> 05:26.333
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

05:26.333 --> 05:31.500
- ROBERT, IF YOU
WANT TO RETIRE, RETIRE.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.067
I WANT YOU TO DO
WHATEVER MAKESYOUHAPPY.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.533
- I THINK RETIRING
WOULD MAKE HIM HAPPY.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.567
YOU KNOW,
THERE WAS A TIME

05:39.567 --> 05:42.633
WHEN PEOPLE CARED
ABOUT WHAT I THINK.

05:47.100 --> 05:51.000
- YOU KNOW, ROBERT,
I THINK I WANT TO HAVE

05:51.000 --> 05:55.167
YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY
AT OUR PLACE.

06:02.833 --> 06:04.367
- UM...

06:04.367 --> 06:06.767
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.500
WE'LL HAVE TWO PARTIES--

06:08.500 --> 06:13.000
THAT ONE
AND THE OFFICIAL ONE.

06:15.567 --> 06:19.333
- IS THAT OKAY?

06:19.333 --> 06:21.167
- MARIE,
WITH ALL THE TENSION,

06:21.167 --> 06:22.667
I THINK WE'VE LOST SIGHT
OF THE FACT

06:22.667 --> 06:25.700
THAT IT'S GETTING VERY CLOSE
TO MY DINNERTIME.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.800
- OKAY.
FINE.

06:27.800 --> 06:32.333
I'M NOT FEELING
VERY COMFORTABLE HERE ANYWAY.

06:32.333 --> 06:35.200
OH, ROBERT,
I JUST WANT TO SAY,

06:35.200 --> 06:36.933
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRUST

06:36.933 --> 06:39.067
THAT LITTLE VOICE
IN YOUR HEAD.

06:39.067 --> 06:43.367
IS YOUR LITTLE VOICE
SAYING, "RETIRE,"

06:43.367 --> 06:48.833
OR IS IT SAYING,
"DON'T RETIRE"?

06:48.833 --> 06:50.733
LISTEN CAREFULLY.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.867
- A LONG TIME AGO,
MY LITTLE VOICE

06:58.867 --> 07:03.100
TOLD ME
NOT TO DO SOMETHING...

07:03.100 --> 07:05.667
BUT I DID IT ANYWAY.

07:05.667 --> 07:10.733
NOW I'M STUCK
WITH A GREAT BIG VOICE.

07:17.367 --> 07:23.067
- WHERE DO YOU KEEP
YOUR AFTER-MARIE LIQUOR?

07:24.833 --> 07:26.433
- WE DON'T HAVE ANY LIQUOR;
WE DON'T--

07:26.433 --> 07:30.567
- TOP CABINET,
BEHIND THE CREAM OF WHEAT.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.900
[alarm beeping]

07:37.900 --> 07:40.033
- OH, STUPID IDIOT.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.500
[beeping stops]

07:45.500 --> 07:47.567
- WELL, WHAT SET IT OFF
THIS TIME?

07:47.567 --> 07:48.633
- I DON'T KNOW.

07:48.633 --> 07:53.833
I THINK I PUT
MY SOCKS ON TOO LOUD.

07:53.833 --> 07:56.433
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU AGREED
TO THROW A BIRTHDAY PARTY

07:56.433 --> 07:58.200
FOR THE GUY
WHO'S RUINING OUR LIVES.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.667
[door opens]

07:59.667 --> 08:01.100
- HI.
- HEY.

08:01.100 --> 08:04.367
[alarm wailing]
- UGH!

08:07.133 --> 08:09.067
IT'S STILL DOING IT,
ROBERT,

08:09.067 --> 08:10.133
MOTION SENSORS
STILL GOING OFF

08:10.133 --> 08:11.433
FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

08:11.433 --> 08:13.867
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THE EXCALIBUR 2000

08:13.867 --> 08:15.200
CAN BE A LITTLE BUGGY.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.833
YOU KNOW, FOR JUST
AN EXTRA $24.99 A MONTH,

08:17.833 --> 08:19.500
I COULD INSTALL AN UPGRADE.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.433
- YEAH, HOW ABOUT I INSTALL
MY FOOT RIGHT UP YOUR--

08:22.433 --> 08:25.733
- RAY!

08:30.667 --> 08:36.567
both: HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
UNCLE ROBERT.

08:36.567 --> 08:41.567
- THEY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DODGE
THE MOTION SENSORS.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.733
- SO, DEBRA...

08:43.733 --> 08:46.167
I DIDN'T GET TO HEAR
YOUR OPINION YESTERDAY.

08:46.167 --> 08:47.700
DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD RETIRE?

08:47.700 --> 08:48.967
- ROBERT.

08:48.967 --> 08:51.333
HE'S BEEN ASKING EVERYONE
WHAT HE SHOULD DO.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.733
HE TALKED TO ANDY AND GIANNI,
HIS PARTNER JUDY,

08:53.733 --> 08:58.567
THE GUY SHE WAS HANDCUFFING.

09:02.733 --> 09:05.467
- I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S
AN IMPORTANT DECISION,

09:05.467 --> 09:07.967
AND EVERYONE HAS
A DIFFERENT OPINION.

09:07.967 --> 09:09.567
- YOU'RE ONLY ASKING EVERYONE

09:09.567 --> 09:12.100
'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
ANYBODY TO BE MAD AT YOU!

09:12.100 --> 09:16.000
- YEAH, HOW'S THAT GOIN'?

09:18.267 --> 09:19.500
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
- WELL, I AGREE.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.833
AND I THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:20.833 --> 09:22.667
I DON'T THINK
ROBERT SHOULD RETIRE.

09:22.667 --> 09:26.133
- SEE? SHE AGREES WITH ME,
AND SHE'S THE NORMAL BARONE.

09:26.133 --> 09:29.433
- UH, TECHNICALLY,
I'M NOT A BARONE.

09:29.433 --> 09:32.200
- HOW ABOUT YOU, RAY?
CARE TO WEIGH IN?

09:32.200 --> 09:34.133
- YEAH, I-I THINK
YOU STINK AT EVERYTHING.

09:34.133 --> 09:37.100
FIX MY ALARM!

09:37.100 --> 09:39.167
- LET'S JUST DO THIS, FRANK.

09:39.167 --> 09:42.600
- WHY DOESN'T THE ALARM
GO OFFNOW?

09:42.600 --> 09:43.933
- HELLO.
- HELLO.

09:43.933 --> 09:45.700
- YOUR MOTHER
WOULDN'T WRAP YOUR PRESENT,

09:45.700 --> 09:47.767
SO I PUT IT IN A COAT.

09:47.767 --> 09:49.933
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

09:49.933 --> 09:53.433
YOU DON'T GET THE COAT.

09:53.433 --> 09:56.933
- LISTEN, MA AND AMY,
I WANT TO THANK YOU

09:56.933 --> 09:58.533
FOR COMING
TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY,

09:58.533 --> 10:00.600
AND I HOPE
WE CAN HAVE A GOOD DAY.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.767
MAYBE A DAY TO RELAX
AND REMEMBER--

10:03.767 --> 10:04.800
[alarm beeping]

10:04.800 --> 10:06.233
- HOLY CRAP!
- COME ON!

10:06.233 --> 10:08.800
WE'RE NOT ROBBERS!
WE LIVE HERE!

10:08.800 --> 10:10.200
WE--

10:12.200 --> 10:13.433
OKAY, LOOK, JUST SHUT IT DOWN.

10:13.433 --> 10:15.400
SHUT THE WHOLE
DAMN SYSTEM DOWN.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.633
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

10:16.633 --> 10:18.700
I'LL PUT IN
AN OVERRIDE CODE.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.867
NOBODY LOOK.

10:21.867 --> 10:25.800
- FRANK, DON'T YOU WANT
TO TELL ROBERT SOMETHING?

10:25.800 --> 10:27.200
- OH, YEAH.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.667
I THINK
YOU SHOULD RETIRE.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.767
- COME ON, FRANK.

10:31.767 --> 10:35.433
- I'M SORRY,
BUT MARIE IS MY WIFE,

10:35.433 --> 10:37.733
AND IF I CAN'T
SUPPORT HER IN THIS,

10:37.733 --> 10:38.967
THEN SHE'LL BE LIKE

10:38.967 --> 10:43.733
AN ICE-PICK
IN MY EAR UNTIL I DIE.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.733
[doorbell rings]

10:51.733 --> 10:52.900
- CAREFUL.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.333
- UH, AM I ALLOWED
TO OPEN IT?

10:55.333 --> 10:58.067
- THE DRAWBRIDGE IS DOWN.

10:58.067 --> 11:02.467
- HELLO.
- OH, HEY, HI.

11:02.467 --> 11:05.300
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ROBERT.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.000
- HI, MOM AND DAD.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.633
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

11:08.633 --> 11:11.167
- I INVITED THEM
BECAUSE I WANTED THEM

11:11.167 --> 11:13.267
TO BE HERE
FOR ROBERT'S PARTY.

11:19.633 --> 11:21.167
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

11:21.167 --> 11:25.700
- NO.
IT'S A PARTY.

11:30.800 --> 11:34.200
- ALL RIGHT, ACTUALLY, I'M--
I'M TRYING TO DECIDE

11:34.200 --> 11:36.533
WHETHER I SHOULD RETIRE
FROM THE FORCE OR NOT.

11:36.533 --> 11:38.133
YOU KNOW,
AND EVERYBODY, OF COURSE,

11:38.133 --> 11:40.400
HAS ALL SORTS OF OPINIONS,
AND, YOU KNOW--

11:40.400 --> 11:42.700
WHAT DO YOU
THINK I SHOULD DO?

11:42.700 --> 11:44.900
- YOU'RE INVOLVING THEM
IN YOUR DECISION?

11:44.900 --> 11:46.233
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

11:46.233 --> 11:48.533
I THINK THEY COULD BRING
A FRESH PERSPECTIVE.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.300
- I THINK
HE SHOULD RETIRE.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.767
- WHAT? NO.
MOM!

11:52.767 --> 11:55.133
HE'S ONLY THINKING
OF RETIRING

11:55.133 --> 11:57.333
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT SHE
WANTS HIM TO DO.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.300
- OH, BUT, HONEY,
BEING A POLICE OFFICER

11:59.300 --> 12:00.867
IS SUCH A DANGEROUS JOB.

12:00.867 --> 12:04.300
I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM.

12:04.300 --> 12:10.000
- THAT'S A LOVELY BLOUSE, PAT.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.400
- I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.767
MOM, IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE SAFETY.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.633
IT'S ABOUT
WHAT ROBERT WANTS TO DO--

12:15.633 --> 12:18.033
- SWEETIE, YOU'RE RAISING
YOUR VOICE.

12:18.033 --> 12:21.633
WE DON'T DO THAT.

12:21.633 --> 12:27.333
- TOO LATE, LADY.
SHE'S ONE OF US NOW.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.567
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHAT I THINK--

12:32.567 --> 12:35.967
[alarm beeping]
OH, SOMEONE, HELP!

12:35.967 --> 12:37.100
- PIECE OF JUNK!

12:37.100 --> 12:38.567
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

12:38.567 --> 12:41.933
IT'S--IT'S NOT ACCEPTING
MY OVERRIDE CODE!

12:41.933 --> 12:44.067
I PUT IN THE CODE...
IT'S...

12:44.067 --> 12:46.200
[beeping stops]

12:52.600 --> 12:56.133
- WHERE'S THAT IN THE MANUAL?

12:56.133 --> 13:00.133
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO
CALL TECH SUPPORT.

13:00.133 --> 13:02.900
AND MAYBE GET ME
A BUCKET OF ICE.

13:02.900 --> 13:06.900
- I DIDN'T GET ROBBED
TILL I GOT AN ALARM.

13:06.900 --> 13:09.867
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, NOW,
UNTIL TECH SUPPORT GETS HERE,

13:09.867 --> 13:12.400
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK
EVERYBODY NOT TO MOVE AT ALL.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.467
FREEZE!

13:18.667 --> 13:19.900
- I WAS GOING TO SAY,

13:19.900 --> 13:24.933
BEFORE THAT ALARM
SET MY HEART INTO ARRHYTHMIA...

13:24.933 --> 13:28.167
THAT I DON'T THINK
ROBERT SHOULD RETIRE.

13:28.167 --> 13:29.767
- THANK YOU, DADDY.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.100
- NO MOVING, PLEASE!

13:33.100 --> 13:36.167
- YOU SEE, I RESPECT
WHAT YOU DO, ROBERT.

13:36.167 --> 13:38.100
- OH.
THANK YOU, SIR.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.300
- AND I ENJOY TELLING PEOPLE

13:39.300 --> 13:41.333
THAT MY SON-IN-LAW
IS A POLICEMAN,

13:41.333 --> 13:43.767
BUT IF YOU WERE TO RETIRE...

13:43.767 --> 13:49.433
WELL, I GUESS I COULD STILL
TALK ABOUT YOUR UNUSUAL HEIGHT.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.100
- [sighs]

13:54.100 --> 13:55.767
- WHAT'S THAT, MOTHER?

13:55.767 --> 13:57.867
- NOTHING.

13:57.867 --> 14:00.367
IT'S JUST THAT YOU HEARD
HOW CONCERNED I WAS

14:00.367 --> 14:02.933
ABOUT HOW HIS DECISION
WOULD AFFECT AMY,

14:02.933 --> 14:06.067
AND I DON'T SEE WHY
YOU COULDN'T JUST SUPPORT ME.

14:06.067 --> 14:08.733
- WE'LL DISCUSS THIS LATER.

14:08.733 --> 14:09.900
- OKAY.

14:09.900 --> 14:14.300
BUT WE WON'T.

14:16.567 --> 14:18.033
- SO I'M JUST SUPPOSED TO
GO ALONG WITH YOU,

14:18.033 --> 14:20.967
NO MATTER HOW I FEEL?

14:20.967 --> 14:24.567
- I DO IT FOR YOU.

14:24.567 --> 14:26.333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- STOP IT!

14:30.133 --> 14:34.233
- WELL, I DON'T ALWAYS LIKE
THE VACATIONS WE HAVE TO TAKE.

14:34.233 --> 14:38.967
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH
COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG?

14:38.967 --> 14:41.033
- WE GO THERE EVERY YEAR.

14:41.033 --> 14:45.433
THERE'S NEVER ANYTHING NEW.

14:48.567 --> 14:51.100
AND I HATE
TO BREAK THIS TO YOU,

14:51.100 --> 14:55.433
THERE NEVER WILL BE.

14:57.733 --> 15:00.133
- THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
SO GRAND.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.967
- YES, FOR YOU.

15:01.967 --> 15:05.900
AND I GO ALONG WITH WHAT YOU
WANT AND I NEVER SAY A WORD.

15:05.900 --> 15:11.433
- TAKE NOTES, MARIE.

15:11.433 --> 15:13.533
- MY HUSBAND IS
AS STUBBORN AS AN OX TOO.

15:13.533 --> 15:14.967
BUT AT LEAST
ON THIS ISSUE,

15:14.967 --> 15:20.100
HE KNEW ENOUGH
TO STAY IN LINE.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.067
- "STAY IN LINE"?

15:22.067 --> 15:23.900
HEY, I MAKE
MY OWN DECISIONS.

15:23.900 --> 15:26.133
- OF COURSE YOU DO,
FRANK.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.167
- THAT'S IT!

15:28.167 --> 15:30.200
ROBERT,
YOU SHOULD STAY A COP!

15:30.200 --> 15:34.967
IN FACT, YOU SHOULD BE
A MOTORCYCLE COP.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.833
WITH NO HELMET.

15:37.833 --> 15:41.233
IN FACT, YOU SHOULD RIDE
AN EVEL KNIEVEL ROCKET-CYCLE.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.667
- STOP IT, FRANK!

15:42.667 --> 15:44.833
YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO CAUSE TROUBLE.

15:44.833 --> 15:46.267
THAT'S ALL YOU EVER DO.

15:46.267 --> 15:49.400
[alarm beeping]
OH! OH, MY...

15:49.400 --> 15:51.067
- JEEZALOO!
I'M SORRY!

15:51.067 --> 15:53.600
THIS ONE SOUNDS
JUST LIKE MARIE!

15:53.600 --> 15:54.867
- OH.

15:54.867 --> 15:56.267
- YEAH, I SPOKE
TO TECH SUPPORT.

15:56.267 --> 15:58.767
THEY SAID I SHOULD SLAM
YOUR HEAD INTO IT!

15:58.767 --> 16:00.700
- WHO DID YOU GET OVER THERE?

16:00.700 --> 16:02.233
- NEVER MIND THAT, ROBERT!

16:02.233 --> 16:03.900
THE POINT IS
THAT MOST OF US

16:03.900 --> 16:05.433
THINK YOU SHOULD RETIRE.

16:05.433 --> 16:07.200
- THAT'S NOT TRUE, MARIE!
I NEVER SAID THAT--

16:07.200 --> 16:08.433
- OH, GREAT.
NOW SHE'S GOIN' OFF.

16:08.433 --> 16:10.000
- RAY, THIS IS IMPORTANT!

16:10.000 --> 16:11.433
- IT'S NOT FOR US TO DECIDE.

16:11.433 --> 16:13.267
ROBERT'S WOMEN
GOT HIM SCREWED UP ENOUGH.

16:13.267 --> 16:14.767
- OH.
EXCUSE ME?

16:14.767 --> 16:16.033
- I'M NOT SCREWING HIM UP.

16:16.033 --> 16:18.033
- THIS IS PART
OF BEING A FAMILY, RAY!

16:18.033 --> 16:19.867
- OH, MY GOD!
ROBERT, COME WITH ME.

16:19.867 --> 16:21.033
YOU IDIOT, COME HERE.

16:21.033 --> 16:23.200
- OH, MY...OOH.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.567
CAN'T SOMEBODY STOP IT?

16:24.567 --> 16:26.233
- TAKE THIS
WHOLE SYSTEM OUT.

16:26.233 --> 16:27.933
- NO, IT'S...

16:27.933 --> 16:30.500
IT GIVES YOU A HEADACHE.
WOW.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.433
[beeping stops]

16:37.900 --> 16:41.800
- WOW.
THAT WAS EASY.

16:41.800 --> 16:46.200
I SHOULD'VE MARRIED THIS.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.600
- OKAY, LOOK, YOU GOT TO
MAKE A DECISION, ALL RIGHT?

16:55.600 --> 16:57.867
'CAUSE YOU GOT EVERYBODY
MAD AT EVERYBODY,

16:57.867 --> 16:59.933
AND INNOCENT BYSTANDERS
ARE GETTING YELLED AT

16:59.933 --> 17:01.633
BY THEIR MEAN WIFE DEBRA.

17:01.633 --> 17:04.467
NOW, YOU--YOU GOT TO
MAKE A DECISION.

17:04.467 --> 17:06.667
YOU...NOW.

17:06.667 --> 17:09.733
- I CAN'T DO IT MYSELF,
ALL RIGHT?

17:09.733 --> 17:11.467
MY WHOLE LIFE
I'VE ALWAYS LET OTHER PEOPLE

17:11.467 --> 17:13.433
MAKE THE BIG DECISIONS
FOR ME.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.267
YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE VOICE
IN YOUR HEAD, YEAH?

17:15.267 --> 17:16.700
WELL, MINE
JUST KEEPS GOING,

17:16.700 --> 17:18.133
[high pitched]
"WHAT'RE YOU ASKING ME FOR?

17:18.133 --> 17:21.833
WHAT'RE YOU ASKING ME FOR?"

17:21.833 --> 17:27.500
- SO--SO YOUR LITTLE VOICE
IS AN EFFEMINATE MOUSE?

17:29.233 --> 17:30.333
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.633
COME ON,
YOU'VE...

17:31.633 --> 17:34.033
YOU'VE MADE DECISIONS
ON YOUR OWN.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.667
YOU HAVE.

17:35.667 --> 17:38.700
LIKE, OKAY, NOBODY KNEW YOU
WERE GONNA ASK YOUR FIRST WIFE

17:38.700 --> 17:39.767
TO MARRY YOU, RIGHT?

17:39.767 --> 17:41.133
- THAT'S TRUE.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.200
- I DECIDED ALL ON MY OWN
TO MARRY A WOMAN

17:43.200 --> 17:46.933
WHO THEN DUMPED ME
FOR A GUY I ARRESTED.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.133
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.300
I SHOULD TRUST
MY KEEN INSTINCT.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.733
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT AMY?

17:51.733 --> 17:53.433
- OH, YEAH, I LOVE AMY,

17:53.433 --> 17:56.633
BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN HAD
THE GUTS TO ASK HER TO MARRY ME

17:56.633 --> 17:58.867
IF I DIDN'T FEEL THAT PRESSURE
FROM EVERYONE ELSE.

17:58.867 --> 18:00.500
THERE'S NO WAY.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.900
- WELL...

18:01.900 --> 18:03.933
[sighs]

18:03.933 --> 18:06.767
MA, WE CAN SEE YOUR FEET.

18:11.033 --> 18:13.000
[door closes]

18:13.000 --> 18:16.167
- GOD, SHE HAS BEEN ON ME
SINCE THE DAY I SIGNED UP.

18:16.167 --> 18:17.700
[imitating Marie]
"DON'T GO.

18:17.700 --> 18:23.767
YOU'RE WAY TOO BIG
A TARGET."

18:23.767 --> 18:25.267
- SO WAIT A MINUTE...

18:25.267 --> 18:27.033
DAD DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BE
A COP EITHER, RIGHT?

18:27.033 --> 18:28.533
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:28.533 --> 18:30.533
HE WANTED ME TO WORK
AT THE CARVEL ICE CREAM STORE

18:30.533 --> 18:35.833
SO HE COULD GET
FREE FUDGIE THE WHALES.

18:35.833 --> 18:40.667
- SO--SO YOU JOINED THE FORCE
BY YOURSELF?

18:40.667 --> 18:42.567
- YEAH, I GUESS.

18:42.567 --> 18:44.867
- WELL, I'D SAY
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DECISION,

18:44.867 --> 18:45.933
WOULDN'T YOU, HUH?

18:45.933 --> 18:47.733
I MEAN,
JUST OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

18:47.733 --> 18:50.200
MOM DIDN'T WANT YOU TO JOIN,
DAD DIDN'T WANT YOU TO JOIN.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.067
I'M SURE I WAS NO HELP.

18:52.067 --> 18:54.833
- YOU JUST KEPT ASKING ME
IF I'D BE WORKING UNDERCOVER

18:54.833 --> 19:00.033
AS THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST TRANSVESTITE.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.067
- [chuckles]

19:05.067 --> 19:10.300
I SAID THAT?
THAT'S FUNNY.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.500
OKAY, BUT YOU
DID IT ANYWAY,

19:13.500 --> 19:17.000
AND I WOULD SAY
THAT IT WORKED--

19:17.000 --> 19:18.700
25 YEARS.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.067
- 27.

19:20.067 --> 19:21.300
- OKAY, SO...

19:21.300 --> 19:22.867
- SO IF YOU CAN DECIDE
TO BECOME A COP,

19:22.867 --> 19:25.333
WHY CAN'T YOU DECIDE
IF YOU WANT TO STAY ONE, HUH?

19:25.333 --> 19:27.333
GOD, IT'S YOUR LIFE, MAN.

19:27.333 --> 19:31.733
SO COME ON, WHAT DO YOU
DEEP DOWN REALLY WANT TO DO?

19:31.733 --> 19:33.600
- OKAY.

19:41.667 --> 19:45.067
I WANT TO DANCE.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.300
- WHAT?

19:55.300 --> 19:57.433
- DANCING.
I'M A GOOD DANCER.

19:57.433 --> 19:59.300
- NO, NO, ROBERT,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE A DANCER.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.533
- WELL, YOU SAID DEEP DOWN.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.033
- OKAY, BUT YOU'RE
IN YOUR 40s.

20:02.033 --> 20:04.167
IT'S TIME TO GO
A LITTLE LESS DEEP.

20:04.167 --> 20:05.167
- CHOREOGRAPHER?

20:05.167 --> 20:06.500
- NO, ROBERT!
COME ON!

20:06.500 --> 20:08.367
STOP TRYING TO AVOID
MAKING A DECISION!

20:08.367 --> 20:10.133
YOU WANT TO BE A COP, OR DO YOU
WANT TO BE AN ALARM SALESMAN?

20:10.133 --> 20:11.567
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:11.567 --> 20:14.800
- NO! NO!

20:14.800 --> 20:16.933
A COP...

20:16.933 --> 20:21.467
OR AN ALARM SALESMAN.

20:21.467 --> 20:22.967
- UM...

20:22.967 --> 20:26.433
- OKAY, LOOK, LOOK,
JUST FINISH THIS SENTENCE--

20:26.433 --> 20:28.433
I'M A...

20:28.433 --> 20:31.700
- COP.

20:31.700 --> 20:34.300
- OKAY.
GOOD.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.067
NOW, WHY'D YOU SAY,
"I'M A COP"?

20:36.067 --> 20:40.533
- BECAUSE YOU SAID,
"I'M A"AND NOT, "I'M AN."

20:47.267 --> 20:49.467
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
BUT...

20:49.467 --> 20:52.100
BUT YOU WANT TO BE
A COP, RIGHT?

20:52.100 --> 20:53.600
- WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU WANT ME TO.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.233
WILL YOU--NO--
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

20:55.233 --> 20:57.033
JUST FINISH THIS SENTENCE--
"MY OCCUPATION--"

20:57.033 --> 20:59.033
- TOO LATE.
I'M A COP.

20:59.033 --> 21:01.033
- OKAY, BUT YOU DECIDED IT.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.767
- YEAH.

21:05.767 --> 21:08.533
I'M A COP.

21:08.533 --> 21:11.000
- YES, YOU ARE.

21:15.633 --> 21:20.367
UH...

21:20.367 --> 21:23.700
OKAY.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.267
- MA!

21:29.167 --> 21:32.133
MA, I'M GONNA STAY A COP.

21:32.133 --> 21:33.700
RAYMOND SAID I SHOULD.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.233
[door shuts]

21:41.300 --> 21:44.233
- OH, ALL RIGHT,
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

21:44.233 --> 21:46.433
LISTEN, MA...

21:46.433 --> 21:48.133
JUST...

21:48.133 --> 21:50.000
I STOPPED HIM
FROM BEING A DANCER.

21:53.067 --> 21:55.667
ROBERT,
TRIP THE ALARM!
