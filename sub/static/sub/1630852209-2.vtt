00:01.067 --> 00:03.035
[Kathleen laughing]
<i>We received a little</i>

00:03.037 --> 00:05.904
red kangaroo named Troody.

00:05.906 --> 00:08.407
I know, I don't have... See,
she wants to get in my pouch.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.109
Oh, cool.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.510
Good looking bird.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.746
<i>[Jim] Toucans are
really neat birds.</i>

00:13.748 --> 00:16.382
<i>Since it's illegal to buy
wild caught birds,</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:18.484
<i>it opens up the trade
in the black market.</i>

00:18.486 --> 00:20.085
I think he's pretty lucky...

00:20.087 --> 00:22.021
that he landed up here with us.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.023
[Kathleen] Well, here they come.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.025
Medomo is out first.

00:26.659 --> 00:29.094
<i>Enrichment is super-important
for gorillas</i>

00:29.096 --> 00:31.230
<i>just because they are
so intelligent.</i>

00:31.664 --> 00:33.499
He's our fashionista.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.501
[Jim] Welcome to New York, guys.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.469
<i>Bactrian deer
are a new species for us.</i>

00:37.471 --> 00:40.039
[Pat] They may not have
heard a horn blow their entire life.

00:40.041 --> 00:43.208
[Jim] I don't think they've probably
heard a Mr. Softie truck at The Wilds.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.882
<i>[Jim] If you ask a child
to draw a picture of a zoo,</i>

00:49.884 --> 00:52.351
<i>chances are they'll draw
an animal behind bars.</i>

00:53.686 --> 00:56.021
We've gotta take that image
and change it.

00:56.790 --> 00:57.956
<i>[man] I really enjoy this.</i>

00:57.991 --> 01:00.359
<i>It strengthens the bond
that we have with these guys.</i>

01:01.327 --> 01:02.895
Come on. I know,
you don't like doors.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.696
[woman] Go on, ladies.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.732
<i>[Jim] It's not enough to
keep animals in exhibits</i>

01:06.734 --> 01:08.133
<i>just for people to look at.</i>

01:08.135 --> 01:09.868
<i>There has to be
a higher purpose.</i>

01:09.870 --> 01:11.870
<i>And for us, it's conservation</i>

01:11.872 --> 01:13.305
<i>of species in the wild.</i>

01:13.307 --> 01:14.673
Keep rolling.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.741
<i>[Jim] The general public
would never</i>

01:15.743 --> 01:18.043
<i>get the access
you're gonna get...</i>

01:18.045 --> 01:20.612
- [woman] Good, girl.
<i>- [Jim] which is to see what goes on behind</i>

01:20.614 --> 01:22.881
<i>the scenes every day.</i>

01:22.883 --> 01:25.184
That's how we do it here
in the Boogie Down Bronx.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.418
[people laughing]

01:29.189 --> 01:30.389
[upbeat music]

01:38.298 --> 01:39.364
[man] You like that?

01:46.139 --> 01:48.607
[Lisa] I'm headed
into the barn right now.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.576
We have six Bactrian deer fawn

01:50.578 --> 01:52.377
that are coming into
quarantine today.

01:54.013 --> 01:57.716
Right now, the deer are probably
somewhere in New Jersey.

01:57.718 --> 02:01.587
They're coming to us from a
wildlife facility called The Wilds.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.322
And it's run by
the Columbus Zoo.

02:05.191 --> 02:09.261
And I'm just making sure
that a lot of the doors

02:10.029 --> 02:11.396
are secure.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.135
[man] Hey, Kallen.

02:16.137 --> 02:19.171
You're gonna be backing
up down this way.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.073
[truck reverse alarm]

02:27.447 --> 02:28.480
[Kallen speaking]

02:32.752 --> 02:34.119
- [Jim] Did you see them yet?
- [Lisa] No.

02:34.121 --> 02:37.089
[Pat] Should be two males
and four females.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.493
- [Jim] Here they come now.
- [Pat] Yeah?

02:43.830 --> 02:45.097
[Jim] They're very pretty.

02:45.798 --> 02:48.800
They have that long neck
like an elk.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.903
[Pat] Yeah, and kind of
a different colored coat,

02:50.905 --> 02:53.038
more like a champagne.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.108
<i>[Jim] Bactrian deer are
a new species for us,</i>

02:56.110 --> 02:58.544
<i>so that's always kind of fun
when we get to work</i>

02:58.546 --> 03:01.046
with an animal that
we've never had before.

03:01.814 --> 03:04.316
<i>In the U.S., there's not
very many zoos that</i>

03:04.318 --> 03:06.318
<i>work with Bactrian deer.</i>

03:06.320 --> 03:09.154
It's only Columbus
and San Diego and now, us.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.189
[Pat] Easy.

03:11.324 --> 03:12.424
Easy.

03:12.825 --> 03:14.826
How are ya?

03:14.828 --> 03:17.696
Actually, I only see
two tagged in the right ear,

03:17.698 --> 03:19.698
so those are males and the other

03:19.700 --> 03:22.668
four females tagged
in the left ear.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.137
<i>I think one of the things
that may surprise</i>

03:25.139 --> 03:27.673
<i>our visitors when
they come to the zoo</i>

03:27.675 --> 03:29.408
<i>is just the number</i>

03:29.410 --> 03:31.210
of species in the deer family.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.812
<i>Members of the deer family
are found in North America,</i>

03:33.814 --> 03:37.082
South America, Europe, Asia,

03:37.084 --> 03:40.485
and there's actually even a
single species of deer in Africa.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.888
<i>Bactrian deer are native
to central Asia,</i>

03:42.890 --> 03:45.991
<i>so they are adapted
to a cold environment.</i>

03:46.759 --> 03:48.026
See you guys later, thank you.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.228
[Jim] Thanks very much.

03:49.362 --> 03:50.462
Take care.

03:52.198 --> 03:54.466
<i>So like all animals
that come to the Bronx Zoo</i>

03:54.468 --> 03:55.734
<i>or any of our zoos,</i>

03:55.736 --> 03:57.736
<i>they have to go into quarantine.</i>

03:57.738 --> 03:59.471
<i>So, they'll spend time here.</i>

03:59.473 --> 04:01.340
<i>They go through
a series of tests,</i>

04:01.342 --> 04:03.108
and then if all goes well,

04:03.110 --> 04:05.944
they will come and join
the herds over in wild Asia.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.746
They're very nice.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.782
- Welcome to New York, guys.
- [Pat chuckles] Yeah.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.919
They may not have heard a
horn blow in their entire life.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.888
[Jim] I don't think they've probably
heard a Mr. Softie truck at The Wilds.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.123
[Pat laughs]

04:24.163 --> 04:26.231
[eagle cackling]

04:31.004 --> 04:32.271
[Kathleen] Hey, Grover.

04:35.241 --> 04:38.977
So recently, we received Troody.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.345
Uh, she's a red kangaroo.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.381
Joey, she's a baby.

04:43.149 --> 04:45.951
She's still on bottle,
she's still in a pouch.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.654
So, I'm just getting
her food ready

04:48.656 --> 04:49.788
and she eats really well.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.923
So, this is a special
marsupial milk

04:51.925 --> 04:55.060
and it's formulated
for kangaroos

04:55.062 --> 04:56.728
at a certain stage
of development.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.297
They have different stages
of milk,

04:58.299 --> 05:00.232
depending on the kangaroo's age.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.204
Hey, baby girl.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.207
She's hungry.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.810
She's a sweetheart.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.112
She's cute 'cause
she's a little awkward.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.051
Put this over here.

05:21.187 --> 05:23.755
All she's gonna look
to do now is to eat,

05:23.757 --> 05:25.257
so this is kinda awkward.

05:25.259 --> 05:27.159
I'll put the pouch
down like this.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.934
[Kathleen laughs]

05:37.837 --> 05:40.038
You wanna eat, honey?
Yeah, she's ready.

05:44.944 --> 05:48.380
I'm kinda glad she's not a boy.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.615
I'd be happy to have
anyone here,

05:50.617 --> 05:52.884
but I didn't want people to
say, "Oh, there's the new Dave,"

05:52.886 --> 05:56.054
you know, she's
her own kangaroo...

05:57.123 --> 05:58.790
with her own personality.

05:58.825 --> 05:59.958
But we do miss Dave.

06:02.995 --> 06:05.964
<i>For 16 years, we were
lucky enough to have Dave,</i>

06:05.966 --> 06:07.632
<i>the red kangaroo,</i>

06:07.634 --> 06:10.135
<i>here as part of
our ambassador program.</i>

06:10.137 --> 06:12.104
<i>And people fell in love
with him.</i>

06:12.205 --> 06:14.806
<i>Dave was a little shy.</i>

06:14.808 --> 06:16.174
<i>You had to earn his trust.</i>

06:16.876 --> 06:17.642
[Dave screeches]

06:17.644 --> 06:18.977
Hey, buddy.

06:19.011 --> 06:21.880
A little over a year ago,
Dave died.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.784
And that left a big void
in our program and our hearts.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.487
My buddy is
the director of National Zoo,

06:28.489 --> 06:31.056
his name is Rick, and he knew
how devastated we were

06:31.058 --> 06:33.191
<i>and a year so later,</i>

06:33.193 --> 06:35.060
<i>he called us
and this little roo,</i>

06:35.062 --> 06:37.195
<i>her mom tossed her out of pouch,</i>

06:37.197 --> 06:38.630
<i>she had to be hand raised.</i>

06:38.632 --> 06:41.400
So I said, "Okay,
we'll take her."

06:41.402 --> 06:43.201
And now, she's part
of our family.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.071
<i>We think she's around
seven months old,</i>

06:46.906 --> 06:49.574
and right about now,
is when she would be coming

06:49.576 --> 06:51.009
in and out of pouch on her own,

06:51.011 --> 06:53.945
and she hasn't mastered
that yet, but that's fine.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.782
<i>You know, even when
a kangaroo comes out of pouch,</i>

06:56.784 --> 06:59.885
<i>they'll nurse up to
12-15 months total.</i>

06:59.887 --> 07:01.319
Okay, you're done, honey.
You're done.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.121
You're done.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.123
And now, she'll groom.
[chuckles]

07:05.958 --> 07:07.426
Good job, babe.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.061
When she gets--
I know, I don't have--

07:10.063 --> 07:11.730
See, she wants to get
in my pouch.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.900
Yeah, she thinks I'm mom and
she's trying to jump in my pouch.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.902
I can't wait for
this quarantine to be over,

07:16.904 --> 07:18.937
and then she could
let loose in the yard.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.872
Are you ready, Troo?

07:20.874 --> 07:23.074
Now, this is the part
we're trying to master.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.176
Come on, babe.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.213
There she goes.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.982
She's doing it better.
[chuckles]

07:30.984 --> 07:32.284
That was good, Troo.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.119
[whispering] Good job.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.021
See you later, babe.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.133
[woman] Hi, sea lion!

07:48.135 --> 07:50.335
[sea lion barks]

07:52.238 --> 07:53.138
<i>[Chuck] I'm picking up</i>

07:53.140 --> 07:55.507
our new Keel-billed toucan

07:55.509 --> 07:56.975
which was recently confiscated

07:56.977 --> 08:00.011
by U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service.

08:00.013 --> 08:03.315
<i>There are 36 different
species in the toucan family</i>

08:03.317 --> 08:04.850
and about 25% of those

08:04.852 --> 08:06.251
<i>are threatened with extinction</i>

08:06.253 --> 08:08.920
and a lot of that is driven
by either habitat loss

08:08.922 --> 08:10.088
or the pet trade.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.224
[indistinct chatter]

08:13.226 --> 08:14.359
Hey, good morning.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.128
Oh, cool.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.898
We're one of
the two federally-run

08:19.900 --> 08:22.467
quarantine facilities
in the United States.

08:22.469 --> 08:23.869
<i>And these animal
quarantine facilities,</i>

08:23.871 --> 08:26.538
<i>their main goal is to prevent
the introduction</i>

08:26.540 --> 08:29.007
<i>of foreign animal diseases
into the United States.</i>

08:29.009 --> 08:31.977
<i>He's tested negative for
the two main Avian diseases.</i>

08:31.979 --> 08:34.112
<i>So, like, his paperwork's
good, he's healthy.</i>

08:34.114 --> 08:36.681
So, we're happy to say
he's eligible to be released

08:36.683 --> 08:38.183
to the Bronx Zoo
and we're really happy

08:38.185 --> 08:40.185
he's found a great home
to go to.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.219
[Chuck] Good-looking bird.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.154
- Thank you very much.
- [John] You're very welcome.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.757
<i>[Chuck] The bird looks great.</i>

08:45.759 --> 08:48.493
<i>It looks like it's in
really good condition</i>

08:48.495 --> 08:50.962
<i>and is really calm
in the carrier,</i>

08:50.964 --> 08:53.265
<i>so I think it'll travel well
back to the zoo.</i>

08:54.867 --> 08:56.768
[Chuck] Thank you.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.670
- [Jim] Does he look good?
- [Chuck] Yeah, looks great.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.272
[Jim] A he, she? Do we know?

09:00.274 --> 09:03.008
[Chuck] We don't know, but I
think Sue might be able to tell.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.075
[chirping]

09:04.077 --> 09:06.845
<i>[Jim] Toucans are
really neat birds.</i>

09:06.847 --> 09:08.146
<i>They are large, they're colorful</i>

09:08.148 --> 09:09.614
<i>they have great personality</i>

09:09.616 --> 09:11.783
so, they've been kept
for pets for years.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.920
<i>Since it's illegal to buy
wild caught birds,</i>

09:14.922 --> 09:17.022
<i>unfortunately, a lot of
that trade has driven</i>

09:17.024 --> 09:18.089
<i>to the black market.</i>

09:18.558 --> 09:21.793
<i>Typically, the animals
are sometimes</i>

09:21.795 --> 09:25.230
<i>drugged, put in spare tires,
sometimes people attach them</i>

09:25.232 --> 09:26.965
<i>to different parts
of their body.</i>

09:26.967 --> 09:29.134
A lot of birds in that situation

09:29.136 --> 09:30.835
will die somewhere
along the way.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.003
[chirping]

09:32.005 --> 09:33.738
<i>So, when birds are confiscated,</i>

09:33.740 --> 09:34.940
<i>wildlife officials realize that</i>

09:34.942 --> 09:37.208
<i>they need specialized care.</i>

09:37.210 --> 09:40.111
And so, who do they turn to?
They turn to the Bronx Zoo

09:40.113 --> 09:41.813
or other credited zoos and say,

09:41.815 --> 09:43.481
"Can you help us out
with these birds?"

09:43.483 --> 09:45.250
<i>So, the best thing
we can do for it</i>

09:45.252 --> 09:47.686
is give it, you know,
a calm stable environment,

09:47.688 --> 09:49.487
where we meet all its needs.

09:49.489 --> 09:52.190
And make sure that, you know,
it has a nice environment

09:52.192 --> 09:54.092
to live out
the rest of its life.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.195
[Susan] Beautiful.

09:58.664 --> 10:00.131
Did he make any noise?

10:00.133 --> 10:02.100
[Chuck] No, barely made
a sound the whole way.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.468
[Susan] Wow.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.736
[man] All right,
we're ready to roll.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.338
- [Susan] You're ready?
- [man] I'm ready.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.478
[Susan] All right.
You have the beak?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.280
[man] I got...

10:15.282 --> 10:16.915
[Susan] Do you wanna
look at the feet, too?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.316
[man] Yeah, we will.

10:18.318 --> 10:21.052
<i>[Susan] I love toucans.
I've raised toucans</i>

10:21.054 --> 10:25.724
from day one until, you know,
they're weaned

10:25.726 --> 10:28.793
and fledged and now eating
on their own.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.328
I'm thinking it could
be a female.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.463
[toucan croaking]

10:31.465 --> 10:32.998
[Susan laughs]

10:33.466 --> 10:34.866
- Good?
- [Jim] We're done.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.601
It's exciting because

10:36.603 --> 10:38.103
we don't currently have

10:38.105 --> 10:40.772
<i>many toucans in our collection.</i>

10:40.774 --> 10:43.074
- [Susan] Oh, nice.
- [Jim] She can fly.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.043
- [Chuck] I'd say she flies just fine.
- [Jim] Stay.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.012
[Chuck] That was quick.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.113
[Jim] Where's she going, Chuck?

10:48.115 --> 10:50.915
[Chuck] We were thinking
a largely neotropical flight.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.284
It's a nice, large
lush area for her.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.889
We're expecting the bird
to be a little nervous.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.858
The wildlife Health Center staff

10:59.860 --> 11:03.261
will be the main caretakers
of this bird in quarantine.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.096
The ornithology department,
will, of course,

11:05.098 --> 11:06.498
work very closely,

11:06.500 --> 11:08.166
<i>so we can work as a team</i>

11:08.168 --> 11:10.669
<i>in monitoring the acclimation
of this toucan.</i>

11:10.671 --> 11:12.671
[Susan] Welcome.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.973
[Dr. John] We need to shave
and do the TB test.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.042
<i>If it's swollen,
there's a reaction there,</i>

11:17.044 --> 11:18.743
<i>we have to follow up.</i>

11:18.745 --> 11:20.812
- She has a little bump.
- [woman] Yeah.

11:20.814 --> 11:25.483
<i>[Dr. John] TB is a really difficult
disease to treat and to cure.</i>

11:25.485 --> 11:26.818
- [Kathleen] Ain't she cute?
- [woman] I love that.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.119
[both laugh]

11:28.121 --> 11:29.754
[Kathleen] Right now,
if she was with mom,

11:29.756 --> 11:31.489
she would start venturing
out of pouch.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.224
They rely heavily on those legs

11:33.226 --> 11:35.226
and it's fun for us. [laughs]

11:39.899 --> 11:42.133
[animals vocalizing]

11:50.142 --> 11:50.975
[Kathleen] Hey, Troody.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.377
[laughs]

11:54.080 --> 11:56.381
Hey, my girl.
You want to go exercise?

11:57.583 --> 11:59.150
Okay, here we go.

12:00.953 --> 12:01.853
<i>Troody loves to be in her pouch.</i>

12:01.855 --> 12:04.055
<i>She does not like
to be left alone,</i>

12:04.057 --> 12:05.924
<i>so, we spend
a lot of time with her,</i>

12:05.926 --> 12:06.858
and now that she's comfortable

12:06.860 --> 12:08.927
we're comfortable
with her weight gain,

12:08.929 --> 12:10.929
her food intake, we're
having her exercise more.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.531
She's excited.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.101
[man] I wonder if she looks
forward to this as much as we do.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.037
[Kathleen] I think she does...
we may look forward to it more.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.172
So, it's cold outside,

12:21.174 --> 12:23.775
uh, but also she's
in quarantine right now.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.578
So we have to bring her
to a place that's safe,

12:26.580 --> 12:28.913
uh, where she can run,
exercise, but not expose

12:28.915 --> 12:31.082
other animals until
she clears quarantine.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.485
- It's beautiful outside.
- [woman] Yeah.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.954
We're bringing her over
to a building

12:35.956 --> 12:37.856
where the carpet is nice.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.724
<i>She'll get her bearings,
her footing.</i>

12:39.726 --> 12:43.061
And we're having her really
let loose and run around.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.999
- [man] Wow.
- [Kathleen] Hey, little one.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.335
[people laughing]

12:52.304 --> 12:54.906
- Hey, baby girl.
- [people laughing]

12:54.908 --> 12:56.107
Come that way.

12:57.009 --> 12:58.343
Hi, honey.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.844
I like that she checks in.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.012
[all chuckling]

13:01.147 --> 13:02.947
[man] She makes the rounds.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.150
[Kathleen] Hi, sweetheart.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.918
- [Kathleen] Ain't she cute?
- [woman] I love that.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.686
[all laughing]

13:08.688 --> 13:10.622
[Kathleen] So, right now,
if she was with mom,

13:10.624 --> 13:13.057
she'd start venturing
out of pouch

13:13.059 --> 13:17.095
and run around and play. And
they rely heavily on those legs.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.230
She has to build up
her muscle tone.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.465
And it's fun for us.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.367
[all laughing]

13:26.172 --> 13:27.405
She meant to do that.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.407
You're okay, honey.

13:30.876 --> 13:32.277
[woman] She's
a confident little thing.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.112
The fact that she just walked into
the middle of all you and was like,

13:34.114 --> 13:35.213
"I'm gonna groom myself."

13:35.215 --> 13:36.281
[laughs]

13:37.483 --> 13:39.083
[Kathleen] Dave was less so.

13:39.085 --> 13:41.085
You know, in the beginning,
he would

13:41.087 --> 13:43.421
take off a little bit, but
then come right next to me

13:43.423 --> 13:44.489
- or stuff.
- [woman] Wow.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.457
[Kathleen] She's
more independent.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.159
Dave was a little nervous
around other people,

13:48.161 --> 13:49.160
it took him a while.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.328
She loves everybody.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.130
[woman] Want a scratch?

13:52.132 --> 13:53.331
You want a scratch?

13:53.899 --> 13:55.967
- Oh, yeah.
- [all chuckling]

13:58.838 --> 14:00.505
[Kathleen] Hey, there,
baby girl. What's here?

14:01.073 --> 14:02.340
- Good girl.
- [man] Good girl.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.975
<i>When Troody clears quarantine,</i>

14:03.977 --> 14:06.578
<i>she'll still be in a pouch, so
we're gonna take her for cart rides,</i>

14:06.580 --> 14:07.979
we're gonna take her
into programs,

14:07.981 --> 14:09.848
we're gonna have her
meet different people

14:09.850 --> 14:11.149
in the classroom or in the park.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.851
It's gonna be so much fun.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.085
We'll be back later.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.120
I love you.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.070
[Jessica] Hi, kids.

14:36.242 --> 14:40.311
I am in the barn, I'm taking
care of our Bactrian deer today.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.148
<i>Today, they're getting
wild herbivore pellets</i>

14:44.283 --> 14:45.516
<i>and hay.</i>

14:46.185 --> 14:47.318
You ready, kids?

14:50.022 --> 14:51.055
Let's shift!

14:51.257 --> 14:52.891
[deer squeaking]

14:52.893 --> 14:53.892
Everybody over.

14:53.926 --> 14:54.993
Let's go!

14:54.995 --> 14:57.228
Let's go, little one.
There we go. Let's go.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.064
<i>The Bactrian deer have been here</i>

15:00.066 --> 15:01.766
<i>in the Health Center
for about a month</i>

15:01.768 --> 15:04.135
and they are doing great.

15:04.803 --> 15:06.905
<i>They are eating really well,</i>

15:06.907 --> 15:09.107
<i>they're calm,</i>

15:09.109 --> 15:11.109
<i>they're using
all their enclosures.</i>

15:11.111 --> 15:13.411
They are really curious.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.247
<i>They're all the same age.</i>

15:16.249 --> 15:19.017
<i>Bruce might be my favorite
'cause he's a pretty boy,</i>

15:19.019 --> 15:21.753
so, he's the buff male,

15:21.755 --> 15:24.422
he's also the most
interested in people.

15:25.124 --> 15:28.092
And he squeaks. [laughs]

15:28.494 --> 15:29.494
[Bruce squeaks]

15:34.767 --> 15:36.634
[Dr. John] So, what
I've prepared for,

15:36.636 --> 15:38.937
um, is to try to just
sedate them.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.838
We need to shave
and do the TB test.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.274
And we'll try to do an exam.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.810
But they're young, I'm not
expecting there's gonna be a lot

15:45.812 --> 15:46.978
abnormal with them.

15:47.246 --> 15:49.080
Today, we need to do a TB test

15:49.082 --> 15:51.482
on our new Bactrian deer.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.751
[Susan] We're gonna open
both of the inside doors

15:53.753 --> 15:56.020
and, hopefully, that'll be
exciting for them to come in.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.323
Hi, guys. Come on in.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.827
<i>[Dr. John] TB stands for
tuberculosis, which is</i>

16:02.829 --> 16:05.063
<i>a disease that
infects the lungs,</i>

16:05.065 --> 16:07.932
<i>and it grows slowly
and then ultimately</i>

16:07.934 --> 16:09.500
<i>they'll have trouble breathing,</i>

16:09.502 --> 16:11.302
and they'll die
from the infection.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.072
<i>Because these deer came
from out of state,</i>

16:14.074 --> 16:15.974
<i>they need a negative test,</i>

16:15.976 --> 16:17.976
<i>so that we can clear them
from quarantine</i>

16:17.978 --> 16:19.811
<i>and they can go out to wild Asia</i>

16:19.813 --> 16:21.112
<i>to their new exhibit.</i>

16:21.847 --> 16:24.015
[Susan] Hey, girl!
What a good girl.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.017
There you go. Ah, yay!

16:26.019 --> 16:27.485
You're very smart.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.387
[Dr. John] I'll get the dart.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.068
Okay. You guys ready?

16:49.742 --> 16:52.710
In three days, we'll try
to read these TB tests.

16:52.712 --> 16:56.514
<i>TB is a really difficult
disease to treat and to cure</i>

16:56.516 --> 16:58.349
<i>in all animals that it
happens in.</i>

16:59.084 --> 17:02.820
<i>So, in general, TB is
not really treatable in deer,</i>

17:02.822 --> 17:04.856
it's something that
we try to prevent

17:04.858 --> 17:06.391
from getting into our herds.

17:08.293 --> 17:10.261
I'm giving this reversal now.

17:12.631 --> 17:14.065
[Susan] Hi, buddy.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.000
He's like,
"Where is everybody?"

17:16.735 --> 17:17.935
There they are!

17:18.103 --> 17:21.305
Hi. Oh, hi, everybody.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.810
[Kevin] Casey,
you good up on top?

17:25.812 --> 17:28.079
- [Casey] I'm ready when you are.
- [Kevin] Okay.

17:28.081 --> 17:30.415
[Casey] It's a pretty big
exhibit to be released into.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.252
- [Sabrina] Are they behaving?
- [Tierney] So far.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.187
[Sabrina] Ooh, he found one
in the bushes.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.956
[both laughing]

17:46.131 --> 17:48.399
[woman] Oh, my God. [gasps]

17:52.071 --> 17:52.937
[Kevin] Let's go in.

17:54.173 --> 17:55.907
We're releasing
the Keel-billed toucan

17:55.909 --> 17:57.341
into the exhibit this morning.

17:58.977 --> 18:01.479
The Keel-billed toucan
finished it's quarantine

18:01.481 --> 18:02.480
two days ago.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.049
And it is out in the exhibit.

18:06.552 --> 18:08.820
What'll happen is,
I'll do the release,

18:08.822 --> 18:11.055
Casey will monitor what it
looks like up on top.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.091
The bird looks in good shape.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.260
Just kinda hanging out,
waiting, so...

18:16.728 --> 18:18.262
Casey, you good up on top?

18:18.264 --> 18:19.697
[Casey] I'm ready when you are.

18:19.699 --> 18:20.998
[Kevin] Okay.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.468
<i>The hardest thing
with confiscated birds</i>

18:23.470 --> 18:26.270
<i>is just... it takes them
a while to settle in.</i>

18:26.272 --> 18:29.107
It's a bird that's just
constantly in motion,

18:29.109 --> 18:30.708
not comfortable.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.443
<i>And they just look scared.</i>

18:47.993 --> 18:49.260
[Casey] Aw, there you go.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.028
Sweet.

18:53.832 --> 18:56.434
<i>[Kevin] That's what makes
toucans spectacular.</i>

18:59.671 --> 19:01.906
Now, he's gonna start doing
what toucans do,

19:01.908 --> 19:04.008
which is he's gonna
start exploring.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.613
He's a little bit overwhelmed,
but he's all right.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.549
[Casey] It's a pretty big
exhibit to be released into.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.718
<i>[Kevin] The south American
exhibit is perfect</i>

19:13.720 --> 19:16.787
<i>for the Keel-billed toucan.
Because of its size,</i>

19:16.789 --> 19:19.190
<i>that gives the toucan
the ability to use</i>

19:19.192 --> 19:22.360
<i>the different levels
of the exhibit as well.</i>

19:23.262 --> 19:24.462
That's very cool.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.800
All right, I'm gonna
come up there.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.502
<i>We send out some feathers</i>

19:31.504 --> 19:33.137
<i>to determine
the sex of our bird.</i>

19:33.139 --> 19:34.839
<i>And we got the results</i>

19:34.841 --> 19:36.674
and the toucan is a male.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.143
<i>Now, the next thing that
we'll be paying attention to</i>

19:39.145 --> 19:41.779
<i>is food resources
and how he's managing that.</i>

19:41.781 --> 19:43.714
Is he coming down to pans?

19:43.716 --> 19:45.883
Now that'll be the thing
that we're looking for next.

19:45.885 --> 19:49.820
The bird's had quite
a journey to this point.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.923
It's the harsh reality
of an animal

19:51.925 --> 19:53.958
that is illegally smuggled,

19:53.960 --> 19:56.027
the garbage that animal
had to go through

19:56.029 --> 19:57.295
to get to this point.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.169
- [woman] Great job, everybody.
- [man 1] Yes.

20:10.108 --> 20:11.342
[man 2] Good high-five.

20:16.481 --> 20:17.949
All right.

20:18.917 --> 20:21.052
[Phillip] I'll take the hay,
'cause I think it's lighter.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.620
[laughs] Hay is lighter
than water.

20:22.622 --> 20:23.554
[man] All right.

20:26.825 --> 20:29.894
We're at our wild Asia section
of the park.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.531
<i>We're getting six Bactrian deer</i>

20:33.533 --> 20:36.968
<i>that are gonna be
joining us shortly.</i>

20:36.970 --> 20:39.704
<i>I don't know
if these new Bactrian deer</i>

20:39.706 --> 20:41.939
<i>like to eat out of hay racks</i>

20:41.941 --> 20:45.876
<i>or if they prefer eating
their hay from the corners,</i>

20:45.878 --> 20:49.113
<i>so we'll learn a little bit
as we go along.</i>

20:49.115 --> 20:51.515
<i>All we can do is make
our best guess</i>

20:51.517 --> 20:53.784
<i>what's gonna be good for them.</i>

20:53.786 --> 20:56.787
<i>Right now, they're at
the Animal Health Center.</i>

20:56.789 --> 20:58.923
<i>They're waiting to come
off quarantine,</i>

20:58.925 --> 21:02.126
waiting for the final results
of their TB test

21:02.128 --> 21:05.963
before they could come join
the rest of the crowd here.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.032
All right.
Looking good already.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.234
I think they'll like it in here.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.843
[Dr. John] Jess, I'm gonna run
and grab some fresh dandelion.

21:18.845 --> 21:19.677
- Okay?
- [Jessica] Okay.

21:19.679 --> 21:20.778
<i>[Dr. Hannah] We are continuing</i>

21:20.780 --> 21:23.981
with our TB testing,
or tuberculosis testing

21:23.983 --> 21:26.350
in our Bactrian deer,
here at the hospital.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.023
[Jessica] Good morning, kids.

21:33.492 --> 21:34.925
They're super cute.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.661
- [Dr. Wellesley] Like, they're just babies.
- [Dr. Hannah] Hi.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.462
<i>Today, we have Dr. Wellesley,</i>

21:38.464 --> 21:42.233
um, who is a New York State
veterinarian joining us

21:42.235 --> 21:44.235
to monitor the testing.

21:44.237 --> 21:46.003
[Dr. Wellesley] Hi, Bruce.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.738
Can I touch your neck?

21:47.740 --> 21:49.106
<i>[Dr. John] To read
the TB tests,</i>

21:49.108 --> 21:51.208
<i>you actually
have to touch their necks.</i>

21:51.810 --> 21:53.711
[Dr. Hannah] I did not
feel anything.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.046
- [Dr. Wellesley] That's good.
- [Dr. Hannah] Yeah.

21:55.048 --> 21:56.480
If it's just flat normal skin,

21:56.482 --> 21:58.149
then it's a negative test.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.785
[Dr. Hannah] Hi, Coral.
Oh, that little...

22:00.787 --> 22:01.719
[Dr. Wellesley speaking]

22:01.721 --> 22:04.055
[Dr. Hannah speaking]

22:04.057 --> 22:06.490
- [Dr. Wellesley speaking]
- [Dr. Hannah] Okay.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.025
[Dr. John]
<i>And if it's swollen,</i>

22:08.027 --> 22:10.328
<i>there's a reaction there,
we have to follow up.</i>

22:11.196 --> 22:13.064
[Dr. Wellesley] Looking
for scraps.

22:13.066 --> 22:15.900
- [Dr. John] She has a little bump.
- [Dr. Wellesley] Yeah.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.668
[Dr. Hannah] Yeah,
Purple was the biggest.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.903
<i>[Dr. John] It's not uncommon</i>

22:18.905 --> 22:20.604
<i>for us to have
this kind of a result,</i>

22:20.606 --> 22:23.207
<i>where we have a suspicion
on the first test</i>

22:23.209 --> 22:25.843
and so, we need to do a
follow-up, more specific test

22:25.845 --> 22:28.846
to determine whether
they really have TB.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.182
[Dr. Hannah] And Green,
we didn't feel anything outside.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.416
[Dr. John] Okay, thanks.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.353
We're done.

22:36.521 --> 22:39.857
<i>If we were to get tuberculosis
in our herds of deer,</i>

22:39.859 --> 22:42.993
<i>it would be kind of
like a slow smoldering problem</i>

22:42.995 --> 22:45.429
<i>and it would affect
a few deer this year</i>

22:45.431 --> 22:47.965
<i>and next year, it would affect
a few more deer.</i>

22:47.967 --> 22:51.969
And if the secondary test
actually comes up as positive,

22:51.971 --> 22:52.870
then we'll have
to have discussions

22:52.872 --> 22:55.072
with our state veterinarians,

22:55.074 --> 22:57.575
<i>and we'll decide on what
the best next steps are</i>

22:57.577 --> 22:59.176
<i>at that point.</i>

23:21.133 --> 23:23.968
[Tierney] I'm working on
making a browse ball or a vine ball

23:23.970 --> 23:26.737
for the gorillas to play with.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.740
I start with a beach ball
and I have these vines

23:29.742 --> 23:30.608
that are porcelain berry,

23:30.610 --> 23:31.709
and I just interlock them

23:31.711 --> 23:34.311
in hoops kind of around
the beach ball.

23:37.849 --> 23:41.218
I learned how to basket weave at
camp when I was seven years old

23:41.220 --> 23:44.054
and it's something I've never
really imagined myself using

23:44.056 --> 23:45.856
in my adult life.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.825
So, it's been a lot
of trial and error,

23:47.827 --> 23:50.227
but, you know,
it's gotten easier with time

23:50.229 --> 23:52.229
and the gorillas love them.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.035
You can pull this out...

23:58.770 --> 24:00.070
here.

24:00.072 --> 24:03.407
Yeah. This actually
looks pretty good to me.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.813
<i>It's important for us
to simulate</i>

24:08.815 --> 24:10.581
<i>their natural behaviors,</i>

24:10.583 --> 24:13.984
<i>so enrichment is super
important for gorillas</i>

24:13.986 --> 24:15.920
<i>just because
they are so intelligent.</i>

24:15.922 --> 24:18.155
They need something to
think about, to play with,

24:18.157 --> 24:19.857
interact with.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.293
<i>Because, in the wild,
they spend so much time</i>

24:22.295 --> 24:24.128
<i>foraging,
looking for their food.</i>

24:30.502 --> 24:32.002
All right.

24:33.004 --> 24:34.805
[Sabrina] Do you wanna stuff
'em with browse and popcorn or...

24:34.807 --> 24:37.575
[Tierney] Sure. Yeah.

24:37.577 --> 24:40.978
We have some fresh maple that
I cut this morning for them,

24:40.980 --> 24:44.815
as well as some freshly
popped popcorn by Sabrina.

24:44.817 --> 24:48.118
Um, so, we're stuffing
the vine balls full of hay

24:48.120 --> 24:50.521
um, so the popcorn
doesn't fall out.

24:54.092 --> 24:56.927
We're gonna be giving
these browse balls

24:56.929 --> 24:59.129
to the boys
in our bachelor group here.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.898
Baraka, Johari, Medomo

25:00.900 --> 25:02.099
and Babatunde.

25:06.037 --> 25:07.238
Let's see.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.009
One up here.

25:12.011 --> 25:15.012
[Sabrina] Anything we can do
to improve their day

25:15.014 --> 25:17.081
and their care is great.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.716
So, yeah.

25:18.718 --> 25:19.750
Okay.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.285
[Tierney] Oh, here they come.

25:23.221 --> 25:24.555
[Kathleen] What are
you doing, Troo?

25:24.557 --> 25:25.923
[laughing]

25:25.925 --> 25:27.791
[man] I definitely think she
could just jump right over us.

25:27.793 --> 25:29.193
[Kathleen] Here comes trouble.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.232
[Tierney] Oh, here they come.

25:37.969 --> 25:41.272
All right, so, it looks like
Medomo is out first.

25:42.173 --> 25:44.508
So he just smelled it,
looked inside,

25:44.510 --> 25:47.111
so now, he knows
what's in there.

25:47.113 --> 25:48.312
[Sabrina] Are they behaving?

25:48.880 --> 25:50.014
[Tierney] So far.

25:50.382 --> 25:53.017
[Sabrina] It's nice-- Oh,
he found one in the bushes!

25:53.351 --> 25:55.185
Yay!

25:55.754 --> 25:57.154
Babatunde.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.989
There we go. There's boo boo.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.858
[laughs]

26:00.860 --> 26:03.427
Babatunde likes to wear things,

26:03.429 --> 26:04.695
so, he'll probably
break it apart

26:04.697 --> 26:06.130
and then wear the vines like

26:06.132 --> 26:08.098
- for the day.
- [Tierney] Necklaces. Yeah.

26:08.100 --> 26:08.966
Oh, there you go.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.001
[all laugh]

26:11.003 --> 26:13.404
[Sabrina] He's
our fashionista male.

26:14.306 --> 26:15.906
Look how cute you are.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.441
Okay.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.678
[Tierney] Just to work
with gorillas is incredible,

26:20.680 --> 26:24.214
in general, but, um, to get
to make things from scratch,

26:24.216 --> 26:26.850
you know, that they actually
spend time with,

26:26.852 --> 26:28.085
it's really fulfilling.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.055
Doing everything I can
to make these guys happy

26:31.057 --> 26:33.991
and, you know, that's all
you can hope for.

26:45.203 --> 26:46.370
Oh, now!

26:54.079 --> 26:55.346
[man] Troody!

26:57.849 --> 26:59.249
Are you ready to come out?

26:59.918 --> 27:02.052
Well, then, come on out.

27:02.721 --> 27:04.221
Troody's out of
quarantine officially,

27:04.223 --> 27:07.057
and we're very happy about that.

27:08.259 --> 27:10.027
[man] There you go.

27:10.929 --> 27:12.029
Yeah.

27:13.164 --> 27:15.199
Run! Go. Go for it.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.234
[Kathleen] Go, girl.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.869
I like it when she gets
that little twist.

27:18.903 --> 27:21.005
Hi!

27:21.007 --> 27:22.773
[man 2] I definitely think she
could just jump right over us.

27:22.775 --> 27:23.907
[all laughing]

27:23.909 --> 27:25.943
[Kathleen] What are
you doing, Troo?

27:25.945 --> 27:28.746
[man 2] This is the longest
run she's had so far, right?

27:28.748 --> 27:30.547
Like, this is the longest
straight run she's had.

27:30.549 --> 27:32.916
- [Kathleen] Yup.
- [woman] Yeah.

27:32.918 --> 27:35.886
[Kathleen] <i>Troody is really
fast, faster than I anticipated.</i>

27:35.888 --> 27:37.955
Red kangaroos
can go 40 miles per hour,

27:37.957 --> 27:39.189
but she's not there yet,

27:39.191 --> 27:41.125
it'd be fun to
clock her and see.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.127
Here comes trouble.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.998
Good girl, does that feel good?

27:50.835 --> 27:51.902
[laughs]

27:51.904 --> 27:54.104
<i>She's funny, she's not shy,</i>

27:54.106 --> 27:57.241
<i>she's real trusting,
she's not bothered by</i>

27:57.243 --> 27:59.910
people coming in and out
or the noises of the parrots.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.078
[birds screeching]

28:01.080 --> 28:02.379
[man 2] I feel like no matter
what's going on,

28:02.381 --> 28:03.714
once she sees that milk--

28:03.716 --> 28:06.984
- [man 1] Yeah.
<i>- [Kathleen] Troody is about 11 months old.</i>

28:06.986 --> 28:10.587
<i>Mom probably would've kicked
her out of pouch last month.</i>

28:10.589 --> 28:11.822
<i>But she'll wean herself.</i>

28:11.824 --> 28:14.324
<i>Kangaroos and wallabies
in the wilds</i>

28:14.326 --> 28:17.194
will nurse up to 15 months.
They won't be in pouch,

28:17.196 --> 28:18.896
but they'll stick their head in

28:18.898 --> 28:20.097
and they'll nurse from mom

28:20.099 --> 28:21.965
while eating solid foods.

28:23.001 --> 28:24.268
[man 2] Wow.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.136
[man 1] Good job. Want more?

28:26.138 --> 28:27.971
No more.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.075
- [man 2] There's no more--
- [man 1] No more. [laughs]

28:32.243 --> 28:34.144
[Kathleen] Troody, she did good.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.080
[woman] Good girl.

28:36.815 --> 28:39.483
[Kathleen laughing]

28:39.485 --> 28:43.087
I think she, uh, is done
with her exercise pretty soon

28:43.089 --> 28:44.888
and she wants
to go back in the pouch.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.156
But I don't have it on.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.458
But she still tries.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.361
[both laughing]

28:54.766 --> 28:56.133
[both laughing]

28:56.868 --> 28:58.102
[Kathleen] Hi, cutie.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.837
I know they do that,
but I just wanna--

28:59.839 --> 29:01.705
I don't have a pouch on, honey.

29:01.707 --> 29:03.907
It's nice having a roo
in the hall again.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.009
<i>Dave was the only
kangaroo we had here</i>

29:06.011 --> 29:07.811
<i>in our tractable animal program.</i>

29:07.813 --> 29:09.346
<i>We've never had
another red kangaroo.</i>

29:10.014 --> 29:12.483
<i>Now, we have Troody,
she's wonderful.</i>

29:12.485 --> 29:14.485
She's not meant to replace Dave,

29:14.487 --> 29:17.087
but she's a nice addition
to our program.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.490
You got big shoes
to fill, my friend.

29:27.499 --> 29:28.866
[horse snorts]

29:30.668 --> 29:32.536
[Dr. John] Lisa, you're gonna
go inside, you're gonna put

29:32.538 --> 29:34.605
the Bactrians
in the outside corral,

29:34.607 --> 29:37.174
- lock 'em out.
- That sounds like a plan, everyone.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.843
[Colleen] A few weeks ago,
we began TB testing

29:39.845 --> 29:41.945
of the six deer.

29:41.947 --> 29:46.650
And upon checking the test site,

29:46.652 --> 29:50.521
<i>five of the six deer
had a reaction.</i>

29:50.523 --> 29:54.191
<i>So, we've had to re-test them
and do a comparative test.</i>

29:54.193 --> 29:56.960
-[Colleen] All right. I'm working that one.
-[Lisa] We good? Perfect.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.695
Perfect.

29:58.697 --> 30:00.097
[Dr. John] Everybody negative.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.832
- Perfect.
- [Colleen] All right.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.133
We got the thumbs up.

30:03.601 --> 30:05.169
<i>So, we're very pleased that</i>

30:05.171 --> 30:07.938
<i>our Bactrian deer
have negative TB results</i>

30:07.940 --> 30:09.706
<i>after their second round
of testing.</i>

30:09.708 --> 30:11.408
[Jessica] Good morning,
everyone.

30:12.977 --> 30:14.978
So, what that means,
is that they are cleared

30:14.980 --> 30:16.180
from quarantine

30:16.182 --> 30:18.282
and we're free to
move them over to Asia

30:18.284 --> 30:19.883
to meet their herd mates.

30:19.885 --> 30:21.185
[man] All set.

30:23.021 --> 30:25.189
Come on, kids.
Oh, you're so cute!

30:25.191 --> 30:26.423
[Jose] Come on, guys.

30:26.858 --> 30:28.225
Moving animals,

30:28.227 --> 30:30.327
you want it to be
as stress-free as possible.

30:30.895 --> 30:32.029
Come on, guys.

30:35.033 --> 30:36.366
It's okay.

30:38.469 --> 30:40.370
- [Colleen] Good job.
- [woman] Yeah. Nice.

30:40.905 --> 30:43.106
<i>[Jose] They came here
in a trailer.</i>

30:43.108 --> 30:44.808
<i>That means, if they're
aware of the situation,</i>

30:44.810 --> 30:46.510
<i>they've seen this before.</i>

30:46.512 --> 30:49.112
So, they seem to be
calm and comfortable.

30:49.114 --> 30:51.515
- [radio beeps] - [Colleen]
Mammal 3 to Asia 1, 2 or 3.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.150
[woman over radio] Go ahead.

30:53.152 --> 30:55.886
[Colleen] We're all loaded up,
we'll be heading out in your direction.

30:55.888 --> 30:57.988
<i>[woman over radio] 10-4.</i>

31:06.097 --> 31:08.065
[Colleen] We just need to
get them out of the trailer.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.266
Out of the trailer,
into the barn.

31:09.268 --> 31:10.400
- [laughs]
- That's it.

31:13.938 --> 31:14.805
[man] That's it!

31:14.807 --> 31:15.906
Beautiful.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.474
- [Jose] Are we ready, guys?
- [man] Yeah.

31:20.912 --> 31:22.346
[Jose] Hey, kids.
It's okay, come on.

31:23.181 --> 31:24.481
It's okay, guys. Come on.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.016
It's okay.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.117
[deer squeaking]

31:27.119 --> 31:28.852
Come on, guys.

31:28.854 --> 31:29.586
Very good.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.388
[laughing]

31:32.023 --> 31:34.491
[man] Sounded like meowing
or something like that.

31:34.493 --> 31:37.094
[Colleen] Cat sound.
It's really cute, actually.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.830
One of you guys gotta go,
and then the rest will follow.

31:39.832 --> 31:41.265
All right? It's okay. Come on.

31:41.966 --> 31:43.200
Hey, guys.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.935
Take your time.
Take your time.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.270
You can go.

31:49.874 --> 31:51.141
- [Colleen] All moved over?
- [Jose] Yeah.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.276
[Colleen] Good.

31:53.044 --> 31:55.245
They're good.
They're just nervous.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.847
[Colleen] So, we ready
for the next step?

31:56.849 --> 32:00.117
[Jose] Yup. We're ready just
to get the fawns access to here.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.486
Try and get them in there,
so then we can open doors.

32:02.488 --> 32:03.954
[Phillip] Okay.

32:03.956 --> 32:07.090
<i>In the wild,
deer are social animals.</i>

32:07.092 --> 32:10.761
So, the Bactrian deer
will probably be living

32:10.763 --> 32:14.031
<i>with 40 to 50 other deer.</i>

32:14.033 --> 32:16.099
But you always want
to start small.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.903
<i>We have Barasingha fawns here,</i>

32:19.905 --> 32:24.341
<i>which makes a very nice
initial introduction.</i>

32:24.343 --> 32:26.476
[Jose] They'll probably be
a little nervous at first,

32:26.478 --> 32:28.779
hopefully, they'll get
used to one another

32:28.781 --> 32:30.147
and be part of the herd.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.017
[Colleen] Oh, boy!

32:38.990 --> 32:41.325
[Phillip] They came outside
pretty quick, they're pretty curious.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.127
[Jose] Oh, there you go.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.296
- [Colleen] Oh, my God!
- [Phillip] Probably got some action.

32:50.735 --> 32:51.668
[Colleen] All right.

32:53.104 --> 32:54.972
[Phillip] We're not
seeing any aggression,

32:54.974 --> 32:57.074
we're seeing
a little bit of antics.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.509
Of course, they're
gonna be excited.

32:59.511 --> 33:02.479
They're gonna run around,
they're gonna check each other out.

33:02.481 --> 33:06.016
It's all relatively
innocent stuff.

33:06.918 --> 33:09.219
[Jose] This is one
of the first steps

33:09.221 --> 33:11.054
and then, we'll give them
access to a bigger sub-group

33:11.056 --> 33:13.623
and little by little, we'll integrate
them to the whole group.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.959
So, just little baby steps.

33:16.561 --> 33:17.894
[Phillip] Oh, they're all
coming out together.

33:17.896 --> 33:19.930
[Colleen] They're
running together. [chuckles]

33:19.932 --> 33:21.765
[Phillip] It's funny,
they're a herd already.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.300
Right in the middle of it.

33:28.706 --> 33:31.675
<i>[Susan] Our newest addition
has been on exhibit.</i>

33:31.677 --> 33:33.076
<i>It'll be a week tomorrow.</i>

33:33.078 --> 33:35.479
<i>The bird likes to watch us.</i>

33:35.481 --> 33:37.247
The fruit cups are interesting.

33:44.889 --> 33:45.889
- [man] Birdie!
- Yeah.

33:45.891 --> 33:47.457
[man] Look at that.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.460
[woman] I could check
for the grape.

33:51.629 --> 33:55.298
[Susan] Let me show you
this little trick I do.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.901
Then you wanna scoop it out
and I put blueberries in there.

33:57.903 --> 33:59.636
Okay.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.938
<i>[Susan] Right now,
we're gonna feed</i>

34:01.940 --> 34:04.241
<i>the Keel-billed toucan,
just to give the bird</i>

34:04.243 --> 34:05.976
<i>more opportunities</i>

34:05.978 --> 34:07.477
<i>to get to food,</i>

34:07.479 --> 34:10.147
<i>because he is still
rather new to the exhibit.</i>

34:10.515 --> 34:11.982
<i>So, the Keel-billed toucan</i>

34:11.984 --> 34:16.086
<i>has now been observed eating
on a regular basis,</i>

34:16.088 --> 34:18.722
and that's definitely
the best indication

34:18.724 --> 34:20.524
that the bird is comfortable

34:20.526 --> 34:23.593
and not feeling any stress.

34:23.595 --> 34:27.330
Toucans have real long bills
to be able to reach in there.

34:31.202 --> 34:34.237
Our newest addition
has been on exhibit,

34:34.239 --> 34:36.073
it'll be a week tomorrow.

34:43.848 --> 34:46.650
This particular
Keel-billed toucan has

34:46.652 --> 34:47.818
had quite the journey,

34:47.820 --> 34:51.455
being illegally smuggled
into the United States.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.691
And it seems a perfect ending

34:54.693 --> 34:58.462
for the toucan to end up
in a South American exhibit.

34:59.664 --> 35:03.400
I'm sure the bird
is enjoying this.

35:07.004 --> 35:09.072
I'm thinking if you can reach
that little nub right...

35:09.074 --> 35:11.074
- See that big, fat nub?
- [woman] Uh-huh.

35:11.076 --> 35:12.676
[Susan] Coming off this branch?

35:12.678 --> 35:14.478
You might be able to get it.
I'll watch your ladder.

35:15.980 --> 35:19.282
<i>This is the first time
that I'll actually be placing</i>

35:19.284 --> 35:20.917
<i>the papaya bowl</i>

35:20.919 --> 35:23.019
and some other
speared fruit items,

35:23.021 --> 35:24.821
like bananas and grapes.

35:24.823 --> 35:28.091
<i>This will allow the bird to
exhibit its natural behavior</i>

35:28.093 --> 35:30.727
of actually feeding for itself.

35:30.729 --> 35:31.895
<i>They use that long beak.</i>

35:31.897 --> 35:33.730
<i>While it looks cumbersome,</i>

35:33.732 --> 35:38.135
<i>it's quite agile and they're
very much able to maneuver it.</i>

35:38.137 --> 35:42.105
<i>Um, and get to fruit items
that other animals cannot.</i>

35:42.907 --> 35:44.708
- [woman] Oh.
- [Susan] That's okay.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.676
The turkeys can have those.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.945
- We have our clean-up crew.
- [woman] Yeah.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.881
[Susan] Our young
oscillated turkeys

35:50.883 --> 35:54.518
are very happy to eat
anything that may be dropped.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.955
- So, I was thinking maybe up here.
- [woman] Okay.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.126
<i>[Susan] The Keel-billed toucan
is a fascinating bird.</i>

36:03.128 --> 36:04.761
<i>They're very active.</i>

36:04.763 --> 36:06.796
<i>The bird likes to watch us.</i>

36:06.798 --> 36:08.498
[woman] The fruit cups
are interesting.

36:08.500 --> 36:12.202
[Susan] So I often see it
looking at me with one eye.

36:12.204 --> 36:14.037
<i>I find it welcoming.</i>

36:16.207 --> 36:19.776
We're done for now,
so we'll see how it goes.

36:19.778 --> 36:22.979
We picked some nice trees
that had plenty of

36:22.981 --> 36:27.384
horizontal perching, so the
speared fruit is very visible.

36:30.087 --> 36:32.989
<i>I don't expect the bird
to come right away.</i>

36:32.991 --> 36:35.058
<i>This is a wild toucan.</i>

36:45.303 --> 36:46.369
I hope he gets something.

37:04.789 --> 37:07.157
[peacocks squawking]

37:08.226 --> 37:10.160
[Phillip] Today is the day
we've been waiting for,

37:10.162 --> 37:11.361
for a few months.

37:11.796 --> 37:14.965
We have our six Bactrian deer.

37:14.967 --> 37:17.867
This is gonna be the first
time that they're going

37:17.869 --> 37:19.836
out on exhibit.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.672
<i>I'm gonna put a little
caution tape on the fence.</i>

37:22.674 --> 37:28.078
<i>Just so they could get a
sense of the lay of the exhibit.</i>

37:28.080 --> 37:30.347
It's been a little bit of time
since we've had them,

37:30.349 --> 37:32.215
maybe three-and-a-half months.

37:34.819 --> 37:36.786
[Jose] They're coming out now.

37:36.788 --> 37:39.022
<i>[Phillip] We went through
a step by step process</i>

37:39.024 --> 37:39.956
<i>of introductions.</i>

37:39.958 --> 37:41.925
[man on radio]
<i>We're opening it.</i>

37:41.927 --> 37:43.827
<i>[Phillip] First, they got
introduced to</i>

37:43.829 --> 37:45.128
Barasingha deer.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.163
<i>Then we introduced them to</i>

37:47.165 --> 37:49.699
<i>mixed bag of our meadow herd.</i>

37:49.701 --> 37:51.101
[man] He is spending time

37:51.103 --> 37:54.371
investigating both the axis
deer and the Barasingha.

37:55.072 --> 37:57.007
Things went very, very smoothly

37:57.009 --> 37:59.009
with the initial introductions

37:59.011 --> 38:01.544
and pretty much just as smoothly

38:01.546 --> 38:03.913
once we put
the entire group together,

38:03.915 --> 38:07.083
<i>which is about 50 animals,
more or less.</i>

38:07.852 --> 38:11.321
[chuckles] Those are
our Barasingha deer.

38:11.323 --> 38:13.690
We've got 23 of them.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.325
You can see
their heads sticking up.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.962
They're curious, they're
wondering what's going on

38:18.964 --> 38:19.796
- right now.
- [radio beeps]

38:19.798 --> 38:20.997
Mammal 2 to mammal 1.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.232
[man on radio]
<i>Go ahead, Colleen.</i>

38:22.234 --> 38:23.700
[Colleen] We're locking up
the gate

38:23.702 --> 38:25.502
and then giving them access.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.337
<i>[Phillip] This is something
that's been on our mind</i>

38:27.339 --> 38:28.772
and anticipating for a while.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.874
<i>We've been trying
to schedule it.</i>

38:30.876 --> 38:33.877
<i>Waiting for the weather
to co-operate with us</i>

38:33.879 --> 38:36.012
<i>and for the time to be right.</i>

38:36.014 --> 38:38.915
<i>And finally we're
at a point where</i>

38:38.917 --> 38:40.984
<i>we're gonna accomplish something</i>

38:40.986 --> 38:43.019
that, you know,
is pretty meaningful.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.854
Hi, guys.
Ready for something new?

38:44.856 --> 38:46.690
[woman] Whoa.

38:46.692 --> 38:48.958
[man on radio] <i>The
Bactrian deer are with them.</i>

38:48.960 --> 38:50.960
[Colleen on radio]
<i>They were actually first out.</i>

38:50.995 --> 38:53.763
[Phillip] Well, go have fun.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.866
[Colleen] They're all
heading out very quickly, Pat.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.034
<i>[Pat on radio] 10-4.</i>

39:03.941 --> 39:05.175
[Colleen] Look at that.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.814
What do you think, Phil?

39:10.816 --> 39:12.482
- [Phillip] That was kinda cool.
- [all laugh]

39:12.484 --> 39:13.950
[Phillip] I wasn't
expecting them

39:13.952 --> 39:15.852
- to be leading the parade.
- [Colleen] Yeah.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.188
- There you go.
- [Phillip] That was good.

39:20.157 --> 39:24.127
<i>[Phillip] It was a very
successful introduction.</i>

39:24.129 --> 39:25.862
<i>This shows a surprising
degree of confidence,</i>

39:25.864 --> 39:27.864
they're calm animals,

39:27.866 --> 39:31.668
but I certainly did not expect
them to be pushing their way

39:31.670 --> 39:33.370
through the door the minute
it was open.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.273
[Colleen] They're over here now.

39:40.077 --> 39:42.045
And now, they're leaving.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.682
- [all laugh]
- [Phillip] Boy, they're funny.

39:45.684 --> 39:48.051
<i>There is a great
degree of satisfaction</i>

39:48.053 --> 39:50.954
<i>to get through
the introduction phases</i>

39:50.956 --> 39:52.689
<i>that we've gone through
with them.</i>

39:52.691 --> 39:56.126
<i>And now, opening up
their world another notch.</i>

39:57.928 --> 40:00.463
The plan is to give them
a good home.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.700
<i>Visitors are gonna be
able to see them,</i>

40:03.702 --> 40:06.002
<i>which is gonna be pretty neat.</i>

40:06.004 --> 40:07.637
<i>They should be fun to watch.</i>

40:07.639 --> 40:11.775
<i>And also, hopefully,
we'll build a bigger herd.</i>

40:11.777 --> 40:14.043
And we'll take six
Bactrian deer, hopefully,

40:14.045 --> 40:17.113
<i>and at some point it will be
more than six deer.</i>

40:22.987 --> 40:25.989
[Jim] He's watching us,
just like we're watching him.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.062
[bird chirps]

40:35.699 --> 40:38.234
[Jim] This is the second floor
of the World of Birds

40:38.236 --> 40:41.271
<i>where the new toucan lives now.</i>

40:43.874 --> 40:45.608
There he is.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.977
He's watching us,
just like we're watching him.

40:47.979 --> 40:51.080
You can see by the way
he's cocking his head.

40:51.082 --> 40:54.050
Even though we didn't actively
go out and acquire him,

40:54.052 --> 40:57.020
he certainly adds
a splash of color

40:57.022 --> 41:00.023
and a lot of personality
to this exhibit.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.893
<i>[Jim] Because of
the Bronx Zoo, we have several</i>

41:03.895 --> 41:06.029
<i>really large bird exhibits.</i>

41:06.031 --> 41:07.430
<i>We have the ability to integrate</i>

41:07.432 --> 41:10.133
<i>these individuals
into our collection.</i>

41:10.135 --> 41:13.369
So, we're happy to be able to step
up and help the birds when we can.

41:15.506 --> 41:17.674
I think he's acclimating
really well, I mean,

41:17.676 --> 41:18.842
he seems totally comfortable,

41:18.844 --> 41:21.811
I mean, he's hopping around
from branch to branch.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.379
He's got plenty of room
in here to fly.

41:24.682 --> 41:26.082
I think he's pretty lucky

41:26.584 --> 41:28.184
that he landed up here with us.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.654
You know, so many times,
these stories can end

41:31.656 --> 41:32.755
tragically.

41:32.757 --> 41:35.258
And it's just really nice
every once in a while

41:35.260 --> 41:38.461
and you get
a nice ending like this.

41:39.964 --> 41:40.463
See you, buddy.
