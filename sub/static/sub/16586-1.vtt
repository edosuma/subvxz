What's my time?

4:50.

01:44.736 --> 01:48.940
[cheering]

01:55.915 --> 01:57.613
Robbie, Robbie, can we
ask you a few questions?

01:57.615 --> 01:59.416
Of course, of course.

01:59.418 --> 02:01.385
I've got to say, you
look very pretty today.

02:01.387 --> 02:02.919
Well, thank you, Robbie.

02:02.921 --> 02:05.189
You have so many supporters
that came out today.

02:05.191 --> 02:06.189
Yes I do!

02:06.191 --> 02:07.891
I have all my
supporters here today.

02:07.893 --> 02:09.660
[cheering]

02:09.662 --> 02:11.227
How's everybody doing?

02:11.229 --> 02:12.495
Robbie.
Robbie.

02:12.497 --> 02:13.363
Robbie.

02:13.365 --> 02:14.430
You've been such
an inspiration.

02:14.432 --> 02:16.199
How are you feeling right now?

02:16.201 --> 02:17.400
I feel great.

02:17.402 --> 02:18.901
The only way I
could feel better is

02:18.903 --> 02:23.739
if we turn around and go back,
start over, with all of you

02:23.741 --> 02:25.441
waiting for me at the end.

02:25.443 --> 02:26.275
Thank you, Robbie.

02:26.277 --> 02:27.745
Thank you so much.

02:29.914 --> 02:33.983
Robbie is an example to us all.

02:33.985 --> 02:38.522
Brave, strong,
focused, determined.

02:38.524 --> 02:40.823
So it gives me great
pleasure to present

02:40.825 --> 02:49.301
him with this check for $6,548
to the Out of Sight Foundation.

02:52.037 --> 02:53.002
Yeah!

02:53.004 --> 02:57.107
Oh man, this thing's heavy.

02:57.109 --> 02:59.643
Just kidding.

02:59.645 --> 03:02.044
[applause]

03:02.046 --> 03:09.286
OK, I have a few special
thank yous I'd like to make.

03:09.288 --> 03:12.322
First and foremost, my mom
and dad for their support.

03:12.324 --> 03:13.357
We love you, Rob.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.657
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

03:14.659 --> 03:15.659
I love you.

03:15.661 --> 03:19.529
And perhaps most
importantly, I have just

03:19.531 --> 03:25.636
got to thank one individual who
is next to me the whole time

03:25.638 --> 03:28.304
I'm running down that road.

03:28.306 --> 03:31.108
Doubts, sure, I have doubts.

03:31.110 --> 03:33.943
But there's this voice right
next to you telling you

03:33.945 --> 03:36.312
that you can do it.

03:36.314 --> 03:39.051
I, of course, am
talking about...

03:40.218 --> 03:42.021
God.

03:43.322 --> 03:45.221
[applause]

03:45.223 --> 03:47.691
ROBBIE: He took my
sight away from me.

03:47.693 --> 03:48.491
Ow.

03:48.493 --> 03:49.358
My bad.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.192
Who's that?

03:50.194 --> 03:51.360
Oh, what's up GT?

03:51.362 --> 03:52.161
Oh, Bill.

03:52.163 --> 03:53.663
What's good, my man?

03:53.665 --> 03:57.434
Be able to see with my heart.

03:57.436 --> 03:59.335
You just ran 26 miles, man.

03:59.337 --> 04:00.137
That I did.

04:00.139 --> 04:00.936
Yeah.

04:00.938 --> 04:02.873
Yeah, dude, marathon man.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.507
Come on.

04:04.509 --> 04:07.109
I bet you glad that bull
shit's finally over, though.

04:07.111 --> 04:07.911
No doubt.

04:07.913 --> 04:10.246
No doubt.

04:10.248 --> 04:13.850
[cheering]

04:13.852 --> 04:16.654
Yo, you wanna go
smoke some weed?

04:20.091 --> 04:20.890
I didn't get it.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.393
I didn't get it.

04:23.995 --> 04:25.295
One more time.

04:25.297 --> 04:26.262
Oh, OK.

04:26.264 --> 04:27.397
There was a lot
of wind that way.

04:27.399 --> 04:28.832
Can I just do it?

04:28.834 --> 04:31.834
Ye... nah, I'd rather
you didn't, actually.

04:31.836 --> 04:32.836
I need you...

04:32.838 --> 04:33.969
All right, let me
know if it's lit.

04:33.971 --> 04:35.272
You know, I mean,
just talk to me.

04:35.274 --> 04:37.139
There, that's hot.

04:37.141 --> 04:39.108
You good?

04:39.110 --> 04:40.610
Yeah.

04:40.612 --> 04:41.812
That sound good.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.480
Yo, you want something else?

04:43.482 --> 04:44.981
Take the edge off.

04:44.983 --> 04:47.250
Like I got this
bomb ass Klonopin.

04:47.252 --> 04:48.551
Have you ever hear of Klonopin?

04:48.553 --> 04:49.820
It's crazy.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.021
What?

04:51.023 --> 04:53.156
There are cops here,
you gotta be careful.

04:53.158 --> 04:55.425
We good, though, for real.

04:55.427 --> 04:56.760
I could shoot up in
front of those dudes

04:56.762 --> 04:57.894
and they don't care.

04:57.896 --> 04:58.762
Bill?

04:58.764 --> 05:00.997
Yeah, coming.

05:00.999 --> 05:01.897
Where were you?

05:01.899 --> 05:02.699
What?

05:02.701 --> 05:04.935
No.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.303
Have you been smoking pot?

05:07.305 --> 05:09.038
I just ran a marathon.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.608
No.

05:11.910 --> 05:14.510
I am so proud of you
running all that way.

05:14.512 --> 05:16.880
Jocelyn says I'm going
to make the front page.

05:16.882 --> 05:19.684
She thinks I should
do a swim next.

05:21.019 --> 05:22.551
What do you mean, next?

05:22.553 --> 05:23.853
For the next fundraiser.

05:23.855 --> 05:26.423
I think it would be cool
to swim across the lake.

05:26.425 --> 05:28.925
But I thought we said that we
were done after this, that we

05:28.927 --> 05:30.760
could stop after the run.

05:30.762 --> 05:33.430
Well, kids don't stop
being blind, Bill.

05:33.432 --> 05:35.667
I know that, I just...

05:38.737 --> 05:40.303
You wouldn't have
to get in the water,

05:40.305 --> 05:42.908
you just guide me from
a boat or something.

05:45.343 --> 05:47.812
JANE: How about right here.

06:04.762 --> 06:06.296
Good, Robbie?

06:06.298 --> 06:07.296
Yeah, let's do this.

06:07.298 --> 06:10.233
OK, it's all clear ahead.

06:10.235 --> 06:13.570
Ease out, that's it.

06:13.572 --> 06:15.906
Good.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.942
Just a hair to the right.

06:18.944 --> 06:20.176
All right.
I got it.

06:20.178 --> 06:21.812
All right, good.

06:24.817 --> 06:26.983
There's a car about
300 yards ahead of us.

06:26.985 --> 06:29.084
Sure, I heard it.

06:29.086 --> 06:32.221
Is someone eating?

06:32.223 --> 06:33.289
Yeah, I am.

06:33.291 --> 06:36.125
OK, could you just
chill out a little bit.

06:36.127 --> 06:37.929
Trying to focus.

06:39.798 --> 06:41.798
You should clean your oven.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.332
I made moussaka, your favorite.

06:43.334 --> 06:44.134
Thanks, mom.

06:44.136 --> 06:45.435
I'm so psyched.

06:45.437 --> 06:47.773
You can just take
the egg plant out.

06:50.274 --> 06:52.175
So dad, how long do
you think it would take?

06:52.177 --> 06:54.546
Probably about 14 miles or so.

06:56.581 --> 06:57.981
Four or five hours at least.

06:57.983 --> 06:59.949
Yeah, we're going to have
to start training right away.

06:59.951 --> 07:01.784
But we're in
shape from the run.

07:01.786 --> 07:02.752
It's different.

07:02.754 --> 07:03.752
You're going to
have to concentrate

07:03.754 --> 07:04.820
on more upper body stuff.

07:04.822 --> 07:06.022
It's all in the shoulders.

07:06.024 --> 07:10.360
You got your anterior
deltoid, lateral, posterior.

07:10.362 --> 07:13.165
Swimming's a whole
different ballgame.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.867
I'm just going to take off.

07:16.869 --> 07:18.468
Where to?

07:18.470 --> 07:20.236
I'm just going
to go have a beer.

07:20.238 --> 07:23.173
I thought we were going to
look at the video of the race.

07:23.175 --> 07:24.341
I'll watch it later, mom.

07:24.343 --> 07:25.875
Hey, Bill, just
don't drink too much.

07:25.877 --> 07:29.012
We don't want you
dehydrated, OK?

07:29.014 --> 07:30.714
OK, Robbie.

07:30.716 --> 07:34.216
You... you stay hydrated, too.

07:34.218 --> 07:37.521
Who do you think
you're talking to?

07:37.523 --> 07:38.921
All right, see you guys later.

07:38.923 --> 07:40.022
Hey, Bill.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.223
Yeah?

07:41.225 --> 07:43.028
Have fun.

07:54.206 --> 07:55.671
What happened to him?

07:55.673 --> 07:57.274
Hit by a bus.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.743
Makes you think, doesn't it?

07:59.745 --> 08:01.411
You gotta really
grab each day, man.

08:01.413 --> 08:03.215
Check, check.

08:04.415 --> 08:06.218
This one's for you, Fred.

08:11.389 --> 08:15.993
[music playing]

08:16.360 --> 08:17.627
Did they take him to
the hospital first?

08:17.629 --> 08:18.894
Or was it like instant?

08:18.896 --> 08:20.563
Uh, I'm pretty sure
it was pretty quick.

08:20.565 --> 08:21.865
It was a bus, so...

08:21.867 --> 08:23.899
Did he just step off
the curb without looking?

08:23.901 --> 08:25.301
Uh, no.

08:25.303 --> 08:28.103
Actually, get this, he was in
an argument with his girlfriend.

08:28.105 --> 08:29.339
Fuck.

08:29.341 --> 08:30.873
He was chasing after
her when it happened.

08:30.875 --> 08:32.342
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

08:32.344 --> 08:33.809
You want another drink?

08:33.812 --> 08:35.277
Let's do it.

08:35.279 --> 08:37.746
I killed him.

08:37.749 --> 08:41.417
I killed the boy that died.

08:41.419 --> 08:43.953
I had just dumped
him when it happened.

08:43.956 --> 08:46.623
You want to know
why I dumped him?

08:46.625 --> 08:50.259
I dumped him because he
licked his lips too much

08:50.261 --> 08:53.563
and I didn't like how
he spoke to waiters.

08:53.565 --> 08:56.132
And that's why he's dead now.

08:56.134 --> 08:58.937
And that I didn't
like his nipples.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.007
I am a judgemental cunt.

09:07.312 --> 09:09.180
Can't like everyone's nipples.

09:17.188 --> 09:20.757
Sometimes I fantasize
about being disabled,

09:20.759 --> 09:22.925
like I'm paralyzed
and people have

09:22.927 --> 09:25.695
to push me around all the time.

09:25.697 --> 09:28.598
And I get to watch a lot of TV.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.898
That's really terrible.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.535
I know.

09:33.705 --> 09:35.604
I love TV.

09:35.606 --> 09:37.406
Me too.

09:37.408 --> 09:38.807
I still have use
of my fingers so I

09:38.809 --> 09:41.612
can, like, control the remote.

09:45.182 --> 09:46.682
We're off now, Rose.

09:46.684 --> 09:49.319
Call us or drop by
whenever you'd like.

09:49.321 --> 09:51.854
It would be great to see you.

09:51.856 --> 09:53.323
Uh, OK.

09:53.325 --> 09:54.826
Thank you.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.533
Those are his parents.

10:04.535 --> 10:07.338
It was their son that I killed.

10:11.442 --> 10:13.578
Do you want a real tissue?

10:19.684 --> 10:21.850
I'm a superficial narcissist.

10:21.852 --> 10:23.654
I'm lazy and resentful.

10:26.625 --> 10:27.723
I slept with a
married man and I

10:27.725 --> 10:29.559
didn't even like him very much.

10:29.561 --> 10:32.494
I almost killed my brother.

10:32.496 --> 10:34.564
Why? you didn't like him?

10:34.566 --> 10:35.665
No, I liked him quite a lot.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.267
I challenged him to
a diving competition.

10:37.269 --> 10:40.204
The water was,
like, very shallow.

10:43.375 --> 10:46.175
Thank you for trying
to make me feel better.

10:46.177 --> 10:47.978
I'm not.

10:53.150 --> 10:55.852
I think I'm just going
to have to go to Africa

10:55.854 --> 10:57.554
and build wells
for people who need

10:57.556 --> 11:02.191
them after this whole thing.

11:02.193 --> 11:03.926
I really am going
to have to dedicate

11:03.928 --> 11:06.595
myself to the less fortunate.

11:06.597 --> 11:10.934
I could go with you and
hang out with the kids...

11:10.936 --> 11:12.234
like the African kids.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.770
For the price of
a cup of coffee,

11:13.772 --> 11:15.774
I could play soccer with them.

11:18.243 --> 11:20.045
Or baby elephants.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.816
I love baby elephants.

11:25.683 --> 11:27.485
Me too.

11:28.620 --> 11:33.290
[music playing]

11:44.469 --> 11:46.069
I love you.

11:46.071 --> 11:47.302
I love you.

11:47.304 --> 11:49.539
Can you be just mine?

11:49.541 --> 11:51.440
Yes.

11:51.442 --> 11:53.843
Let's stay like this forever.

11:53.845 --> 11:56.146
Paralyzed.

11:56.148 --> 11:59.148
Then we can get a
TV on the ceiling?

11:59.150 --> 12:01.618
Yeah, it'll be like a boat.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.820
I get seasick.

12:03.822 --> 12:05.387
It's a boat with no water.

12:05.389 --> 12:09.459
Oh, I love those kind of boats.

12:09.461 --> 12:11.429
You're perfect.

12:40.357 --> 12:41.156
Good morning.

12:41.158 --> 12:43.892
Oh, hi.

12:43.894 --> 12:45.261
Hey.

12:45.263 --> 12:48.897
Just can't find my dress.

12:48.899 --> 12:51.166
Can I cook you some breakfast?

12:51.168 --> 12:53.470
Um, that's OK.

13:00.144 --> 13:01.646
Um...

13:03.648 --> 13:09.352
This is not the way they go.

13:09.354 --> 13:11.022
Looks... looks great.

13:13.591 --> 13:15.425
Oh, your dress.

13:15.427 --> 13:16.928
I would love it.

13:19.264 --> 13:20.765
Here you go.

13:24.903 --> 13:29.574
So, I had a really
good time last night.

13:31.576 --> 13:38.180
It was very lovely and I'm very
hungover, borderline poisoned.

13:38.182 --> 13:41.718
So can I call you sometime?

13:41.720 --> 13:45.254
I don't think
that's a great idea.

13:45.256 --> 13:49.025
You're... oh, you're
being serious.

13:49.027 --> 13:50.727
Yeah.

13:50.729 --> 13:54.162
I can't go out with
anyone right now.

13:54.164 --> 13:56.866
Nobody should go out with me.

13:56.868 --> 13:57.967
Well, we don't have to go out.

13:57.969 --> 14:02.238
We could just lie in
the boat and watch TV.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.007
I can't.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.108
How come?

14:06.110 --> 14:09.647
You going to Africa to play
soccer the baby elephants?

14:13.150 --> 14:16.151
Yeah, it's not a joke.

14:16.153 --> 14:18.253
This isn't where I'm
supposed to be this morning.

14:18.255 --> 14:21.123
And I am going to
dedicate myself to that.

14:21.125 --> 14:23.926
I'm going to do good
things for other people.

14:23.928 --> 14:25.429
You could help me.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.199
Why, what's wrong with you?

14:31.201 --> 14:33.136
Everything.

14:33.138 --> 14:36.805
I mean, my life is kind of shit.

14:36.807 --> 14:39.074
All right, well thank you.

14:39.076 --> 14:42.210
And, or, I'm sorry.

14:42.212 --> 14:44.415
Uh, really nice to meet you.

15:08.005 --> 15:11.406
You do want to go
on the... oh, my god.

15:11.408 --> 15:12.574
Hello.

15:12.576 --> 15:15.011
Good morning.

15:15.013 --> 15:16.079
Good morning.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.680
Get off.

15:17.682 --> 15:20.282
Did I just hear somebody leave?

15:20.284 --> 15:21.984
Did I?

15:21.986 --> 15:24.853
Oh, what's going on, Billy?

15:24.855 --> 15:26.555
Did Billy finally have some sex?

15:26.557 --> 15:27.357
Huh?

15:27.359 --> 15:28.391
Did he?

15:28.393 --> 15:30.292
Tell me what's going
on, little Billy.

15:30.294 --> 15:32.395
You're squashing me.

15:32.397 --> 15:35.364
Oh my god, are you in love?

15:35.366 --> 15:36.632
You're in love!

15:36.634 --> 15:38.434
Who was she?

15:38.436 --> 15:39.469
Some girl I met at the bar.

15:39.471 --> 15:40.302
It doesn't matter.

15:40.304 --> 15:41.570
I'm not going to see her again.

15:41.572 --> 15:42.372
Why?

15:42.374 --> 15:43.940
Was she gross?

15:43.942 --> 15:46.243
She wouldn't give
me her phone number.

15:48.513 --> 15:49.945
Oh, oh shit.

15:49.947 --> 15:52.482
I'm sorry, man.

15:52.484 --> 15:55.017
Well, it's probably not
the girl of your dreams

15:55.019 --> 15:58.787
if she spent the night
on the first night.

15:58.789 --> 16:01.424
You can do better, OK?

16:01.426 --> 16:03.725
It's going to be OK.

16:03.727 --> 16:08.565
Sh, little Billy,
it's going to be OK.

16:17.375 --> 16:18.974
I thought after
your race thingy,

16:18.976 --> 16:21.143
we go back to you
doing early mornings.

16:21.145 --> 16:23.813
Yeah, well it turns out that
I'm going to continue to have

16:23.815 --> 16:25.515
to train early mornings.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.783
How come you get to choose?

16:27.785 --> 16:30.987
Because I'm the manager
and I make the schedule.

16:30.989 --> 16:36.492
Oh, it is so hard being
a white American man.

16:36.494 --> 16:39.364
My heart, it bleeds for you.

16:48.306 --> 16:49.204
Why aren't you getting in?

16:49.206 --> 16:50.506
Because I'm not swimming.

16:50.508 --> 16:51.641
Why not?

16:51.643 --> 16:53.376
It's a swimming pool, nothing
bad's going to happen.

16:53.378 --> 16:55.877
They have lifeguards.

16:55.879 --> 16:57.280
Actually, they don't
life guards here.

16:57.282 --> 16:58.347
But that's not the point.

16:58.349 --> 17:00.682
The point is that I
don't want to do it.

17:00.684 --> 17:04.119
So what if I get into
trouble when I'm out there,

17:04.122 --> 17:06.255
all alone on the empty seas?

17:06.257 --> 17:08.023
I'll throw you
a life preserver.

17:08.026 --> 17:10.258
Or you can get someone
else to row for you.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.961
Or you could just not
do the swim at all.

17:12.963 --> 17:14.696
I'll swim next to you, baby.

17:14.699 --> 17:15.797
I'm not doing the swim.

17:15.799 --> 17:16.833
Oh.

17:16.835 --> 17:17.900
OK, never mind.

17:17.902 --> 17:19.737
I thought it'd be fun.

17:37.755 --> 17:39.188
Sorry, I'll just
be two minutes.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.088
Oh, no.
It's OK.

17:40.090 --> 17:41.658
You don't have to come.

17:45.028 --> 17:45.894
What's that now?

17:45.896 --> 17:46.696
I met a girl.

17:46.698 --> 17:49.632
She wants to help me train.

17:49.634 --> 17:51.400
Really?

17:51.402 --> 17:52.934
That's great.

17:52.936 --> 17:54.303
Who is she?

17:54.305 --> 17:58.106
New volunteer at the center,
says she's desperate to help.

17:58.108 --> 18:00.676
Desperate, wow, sexy.

18:00.678 --> 18:02.178
How do I look?

18:02.180 --> 18:03.211
Beautiful, baby.

18:03.213 --> 18:04.613
Thanks, baby.

18:04.615 --> 18:05.515
See you later.

18:05.517 --> 18:06.516
Have fun.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.319
I will.

18:19.631 --> 18:22.131
OK, the way this is going to
work is you follow my pace.

18:22.133 --> 18:24.299
You're basically my eyes.

18:24.301 --> 18:25.301
You don't pull on my arm.

18:25.303 --> 18:27.402
You don't suddenly
change direction.

18:27.404 --> 18:29.805
You just guide.

18:29.807 --> 18:33.441
Right, so I'm like
a very important dog.

18:33.443 --> 18:34.876
That's right, you're
a very important dog.

18:34.878 --> 18:36.278
Thank you.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.580
- Ready?
- Yeah.

18:37.582 --> 18:38.480
OK, let's go.

18:38.482 --> 18:39.983
OK.

18:41.419 --> 18:42.218
How's this?

18:42.220 --> 18:43.286
It's too fast for you?

18:43.288 --> 18:44.653
No, it's good.

18:44.655 --> 18:46.322
OK, good, because it's getting
a lot faster here coming up.

18:46.324 --> 18:47.323
It is?

18:47.325 --> 18:48.423
Oh.
Sorry.

18:48.425 --> 18:49.225
Sorry.

18:49.227 --> 18:50.192
OK, OK.

18:50.194 --> 18:50.992
That's fine.

18:50.994 --> 18:52.161
That's fine.

18:52.163 --> 18:55.198
It's just all the
accolades and trophies

18:55.200 --> 18:57.065
and all that stuff
just doesn't really

18:57.067 --> 18:58.801
end up meaning all that
much at the end of the day.

18:58.803 --> 18:59.969
I mean, I appreciate it.

18:59.971 --> 19:02.171
And it's nice to
walk around and have

19:02.173 --> 19:03.605
everyone know who
I am and stuff,

19:03.607 --> 19:05.173
but it's not that
important to me.

19:05.175 --> 19:05.975
You know?

19:05.977 --> 19:07.209
Right.

19:07.211 --> 19:08.611
I'm spreading the word
about taking care yourself.

19:08.613 --> 19:10.580
I mean, I've been training
on and off for a few years

19:10.582 --> 19:11.846
and so I'm in pretty good shape.

19:11.848 --> 19:13.015
Yeah, you look it.

19:13.017 --> 19:15.084
I just... I just like it.

19:15.086 --> 19:17.085
Just seeing what a difference
it makes to all the kids

19:17.087 --> 19:18.988
makes everything
worthwhile, you know?

19:18.990 --> 19:23.795
Yeah, I think
that's really sweet.

19:29.733 --> 19:32.200
Oh, Rob.

19:32.202 --> 19:35.371
Sorry, did you not
want me to do that?

19:35.373 --> 19:38.039
I'm... you were
touching my hand.

19:38.041 --> 19:40.843
No, I... I know.

19:40.845 --> 19:42.444
You had something
in your sleeve.

19:42.446 --> 19:43.511
Right.

19:43.513 --> 19:45.480
OK, that... it's not
embarrassing at all.

19:45.482 --> 19:46.982
No, it isn't.

19:46.984 --> 19:48.617
Sorry.

19:48.619 --> 19:50.452
This is definitely my fault.

19:50.454 --> 19:51.720
Well, it's not your fault.

19:51.722 --> 19:55.857
Listen, if I was in
a different place,

19:55.859 --> 19:57.492
you would be really
the kind of person

19:57.494 --> 19:58.827
that I would be
lucky to go out with.

19:58.829 --> 20:00.328
You really don't need
to say anything, Rose.

20:00.330 --> 20:01.162
It's fine.
OK?

20:01.164 --> 20:02.364
I get it.

20:02.366 --> 20:04.834
I think that what you do,
all of your charity work

20:04.836 --> 20:07.702
is really beautiful and amazing.

20:07.704 --> 20:11.207
Seriously, I'm
actually sighted.

20:11.209 --> 20:12.908
And I just do this
whole blind thing

20:12.910 --> 20:15.510
because clearly it's this
total turn on for the girls.

20:15.512 --> 20:16.411
Stop.
Stop.

20:16.413 --> 20:17.915
Stop.

20:21.818 --> 20:22.785
OK.

20:22.787 --> 20:23.585
I'm sorry.

20:23.587 --> 20:25.388
Don't apologize.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.224
I enjoyed that very much.

20:28.226 --> 20:31.393
Do you want to try it again
now that I'm prepared?

20:31.395 --> 20:33.697
Yeah, sure.

20:41.439 --> 20:43.372
Hi.

20:43.374 --> 20:44.239
How was blindy?

20:44.241 --> 20:45.742
Fine.

20:49.079 --> 20:50.412
He kissed me.

20:50.414 --> 20:51.479
He what?

20:51.481 --> 20:52.882
How did that happen?

20:52.884 --> 20:57.486
He kissed me and then I said,
I don't feel that way about you.

20:57.488 --> 21:00.488
And then he just, like,
looked really sad.

21:00.490 --> 21:01.724
Oh, shit.

21:01.726 --> 21:04.994
Yeah, so I kissed him.

21:04.996 --> 21:08.764
Because you didn't
want him to look so sad.

21:08.766 --> 21:13.369
He's incredibly nice and he
does a lot of charity stuff.

21:13.371 --> 21:15.705
You know he's not
going to die, right?

21:15.707 --> 21:18.440
If you say, look, I
don't want to kiss you,

21:18.442 --> 21:20.442
his head is not
going to explode.

21:20.444 --> 21:21.443
You're not that important.

21:21.445 --> 21:24.046
Yeah, I do know that.

21:24.048 --> 21:27.949
But I'm also taking an
interesting new look

21:27.951 --> 21:29.852
where I think this could
be really cool opportunity

21:29.854 --> 21:31.353
for me to help somebody.

21:31.355 --> 21:34.457
Uh huh, because to me that
sounds like a pity fuck.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.391
No.

21:35.393 --> 21:36.726
If that's what it
is, we could get

21:36.728 --> 21:39.694
some homeless guys up in here,
really take care of them.

21:39.696 --> 21:41.463
Maybe Robbie is the
greatest guy ever

21:41.465 --> 21:44.600
and I just don't know
it because I'm horrible.

21:44.602 --> 21:47.870
So you're attracted to him?

21:47.872 --> 21:49.138
No.

21:49.140 --> 21:52.173
But Fred is dead because I
did not like his nipples.

21:52.175 --> 21:53.441
That's why he's deceased.

21:53.443 --> 21:55.878
Which makes me feel like
everything about me is wrong.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.814
So I need to change and
therefore I'm not dumping him.

21:58.816 --> 21:59.715
And that's that.

21:59.717 --> 22:01.519
This is interesting.

22:05.722 --> 22:09.225
So what are you going to say?

22:09.227 --> 22:11.727
I'll say hello if she's
hot and hi if she's not.

22:11.729 --> 22:14.764
OK, but seriously, if she's a
pig, you have to tell me, OK?

22:14.766 --> 22:17.565
If she's a pig,
I'll shout, pig.

22:17.567 --> 22:18.366
OK, great.

22:18.368 --> 22:20.236
That's an excellent plan.

22:20.238 --> 22:21.937
All right.

22:21.939 --> 22:23.873
Did you dye your hair?

22:23.875 --> 22:25.240
No.

22:25.242 --> 22:28.009
Because it looks
kind of sun kissed.

22:28.011 --> 22:29.978
Did you just say sun kissed?

22:29.980 --> 22:34.417
Yeah, like the sun knelt down
and planted a sweet little kiss

22:34.419 --> 22:35.517
on your melon.

22:35.519 --> 22:38.286
Maybe it knelt down
and jizzed on my melon.

22:38.288 --> 22:40.122
I'm pretty sure, in
that case, the term

22:40.124 --> 22:42.926
would be that your
hair looks sun jizzed.

22:43.728 --> 22:45.561
Is that the kind of relationship
you have with the sun?

22:45.563 --> 22:46.495
No, no.

22:46.497 --> 22:48.665
Learn something
new every day, huh?

22:56.473 --> 22:57.974
Hello.

22:59.876 --> 23:02.844
Billy, are you
going to say hello?

23:02.846 --> 23:04.648
Or hi?

23:07.050 --> 23:08.717
We actually have met before.

23:08.719 --> 23:10.151
What? No way.

23:10.153 --> 23:10.986
That's crazy.

23:10.988 --> 23:13.221
How do you guys know each other?

23:13.223 --> 23:14.222
Socially.

23:14.224 --> 23:17.527
We know each other socially.

23:19.463 --> 23:21.296
Nice to see you again, Rose.

23:21.298 --> 23:23.498
Nice to see you again as well.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.600
Well, this is awesome.

23:24.602 --> 23:26.235
You know, Bill's my
right hand man so it's

23:26.237 --> 23:28.539
essential you guys get along.

23:31.107 --> 23:31.907
Hi.

23:31.909 --> 23:33.142
Hi.

23:33.144 --> 23:34.075
You look very pretty today.

23:34.077 --> 23:35.811
Oh, thank you.

23:35.813 --> 23:36.812
Oh, OK.

23:36.814 --> 23:37.613
Yeah.

23:37.615 --> 23:38.413
I'm sure you do.

23:38.415 --> 23:41.382
I'm sure you do.

23:41.384 --> 23:43.384
See you later, Bill.

23:43.386 --> 23:44.888
Don't wait up.

23:57.034 --> 23:58.970
You awake?

24:00.872 --> 24:01.970
Yeah.

24:01.972 --> 24:02.872
What happened to you?

24:02.874 --> 24:03.671
You didn't say anything.

24:03.673 --> 24:07.476
Is she's hot or is she a pig?

24:07.478 --> 24:09.010
She's nice looking.

24:09.012 --> 24:10.679
Just nice?

24:10.681 --> 24:12.948
She's good looking.

24:12.950 --> 24:15.116
You're not just saying that
so I'll go out with her?

24:15.118 --> 24:16.218
No.

24:16.220 --> 24:19.321
OK, sorry, go back to sleep.

24:19.323 --> 24:20.322
Can you close the door?

24:20.324 --> 24:23.126
Why are you asleep...
it's like 9:00.

24:25.195 --> 24:27.796
I'm the devil.

24:27.798 --> 24:29.465
You're not the devil.

24:29.467 --> 24:32.101
How could you have known
that they were brothers?

24:32.103 --> 24:35.170
I don't really know
but I feel like maybe I

24:35.172 --> 24:39.307
did, like some dark part
of me knew that it was bad

24:39.309 --> 24:43.178
and then it made me do it
because that's what it wants.

24:43.180 --> 24:44.313
So you're psychic now?

24:44.315 --> 24:45.480
I don't know.

24:45.482 --> 24:47.949
You're just like all
powerful and all knowing.

24:47.951 --> 24:49.285
And everything that
happens, happens

24:49.287 --> 24:50.553
because you make it happen.

24:50.555 --> 24:52.287
Like if someone takes
a shit in China,

24:52.289 --> 24:54.256
it's because you
did something bad.

24:54.258 --> 24:55.490
OK.

24:55.492 --> 24:56.458
So what are you going to do?

24:56.460 --> 24:57.293
Nothing.

24:57.295 --> 24:58.259
I'm not going to do anything.

24:58.261 --> 24:59.394
I'm going out with Robbie.

24:59.396 --> 25:00.528
Uh huh.

25:00.530 --> 25:02.163
And you have no feelings
for Bill, whatsoever.

25:02.165 --> 25:03.798
Honestly, who cares?

25:03.800 --> 25:04.732
I can't trust my feelings.

25:04.734 --> 25:07.803
My feelings are fucked.

25:07.805 --> 25:11.039
Does it bother you
that he's blind?

25:11.041 --> 25:12.641
No, I like it.

25:12.643 --> 25:13.976
Oh, you're into it.

25:13.978 --> 25:15.477
Not into it.

25:15.479 --> 25:16.812
You find it sexually alluring.

25:16.814 --> 25:19.582
Well, not... I don't
mean like, oh, I like it.

25:19.584 --> 25:21.350
You know what I'm
looking for in a guy?

25:21.352 --> 25:23.285
Like someone a
little taller than me

25:23.287 --> 25:26.488
and preferably kind of
handsome, and you know,

25:26.490 --> 25:27.722
visually impaired.

25:27.724 --> 25:28.891
Oh my god.

25:28.893 --> 25:31.561
I think there are websites
for people like you.

25:34.832 --> 25:38.433
Are you going to pay
for that printing?

25:38.435 --> 25:39.867
No.

25:39.869 --> 25:42.337
And yet you boss me.

25:42.339 --> 25:44.172
I work, I don't steal.

25:44.174 --> 25:46.743
And yet you boss me.

25:50.047 --> 25:54.083
You want to come over
to my house later?

25:54.085 --> 25:55.851
I don't think
that's a good idea.

25:55.853 --> 25:58.152
It is just sex.

25:58.154 --> 26:00.488
To be honest with you,
I just got my period.

26:00.490 --> 26:04.462
Christ, all you American
men, you're so sensitive.

26:12.803 --> 26:13.701
Is that oil?

26:13.703 --> 26:17.105
Yeah, it's good for resistance.

26:17.107 --> 26:19.776
You have to shave off
that vital half a second.

26:25.249 --> 26:26.047
Meet you out there.

26:26.049 --> 26:27.784
I'm going to take a shit.

26:35.226 --> 26:37.593
Didn't know that you
were going to be here.

26:37.595 --> 26:39.430
Robbie asked me to come.

26:41.731 --> 26:44.768
So are you like his new reader?

26:44.999 --> 26:45.968
Yeah.

26:45.970 --> 26:48.170
Didn't know you did that.

26:48.172 --> 26:50.538
Well, I mean, I just started.

26:50.540 --> 26:56.711
Well, it's very nice of you.

26:56.713 --> 26:58.514
You didn't tell me that
your brother was blind.

26:58.516 --> 26:59.314
I thought I did.

26:59.316 --> 27:00.114
You didn't

27:00.116 --> 27:02.116
I'm pretty sure I did.

27:02.118 --> 27:02.918
Hi.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.920
Where's my special lady?

27:04.922 --> 27:05.720
Hey.

27:05.722 --> 27:06.587
Hey.

27:06.589 --> 27:07.555
- Hi.
- There you are.

27:07.557 --> 27:08.356
Hi.

27:08.358 --> 27:10.124
How are you doing?

27:10.126 --> 27:12.795
Oh, I like the feel of this.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.631
You in a swimsuit,
that's so nice.

27:15.633 --> 27:16.632
What color is it?

27:16.634 --> 27:17.498
Um, it's blue.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.299
Ah, it's blue.

27:18.301 --> 27:21.170
I like blue.

27:21.172 --> 27:23.104
Well, my brother
says you're hot, so...

27:23.106 --> 27:24.373
Oh, well...

27:24.375 --> 27:26.176
Gotta be something.

27:28.078 --> 27:29.545
OK.

27:29.547 --> 27:32.516
OK, get ready to
watch poetry in motion.

27:40.391 --> 27:41.190
What did you think?

27:41.192 --> 27:41.989
Good.

27:41.991 --> 27:43.592
OK.

27:43.594 --> 27:45.193
Hey, Bill, you gotta
get Rose on the roster.

27:45.195 --> 27:47.563
She really wants to
help out, get involved.

27:47.565 --> 27:49.532
Show her how to use the finger.

27:55.972 --> 27:58.940
Are you going to tell him?

27:58.942 --> 28:02.177
What, that I've see you naked?

28:02.179 --> 28:04.078
Yeah, weirdly, I don't
think that's the best idea.

28:04.080 --> 28:07.650
Yeah, because that would be a
really weird way to say that.

28:10.688 --> 28:13.555
I didn't know that
he was your brother.

28:13.557 --> 28:15.358
You said that already.

28:20.029 --> 28:23.798
Is this part of, like,
you being a better person?

28:23.800 --> 28:26.634
And what do you mean by that?

28:26.636 --> 28:29.071
Robbie isn't a baby
elephant to you, is he?

28:29.073 --> 28:29.872
Right.

28:29.874 --> 28:30.671
Right.

28:30.673 --> 28:31.707
No, he's not.

28:31.709 --> 28:32.507
We met.

28:32.509 --> 28:33.542
We got along.

28:33.544 --> 28:34.910
We decided to go out.

28:34.912 --> 28:36.378
I thought you said you didn't
want to go out with anyone,

28:36.380 --> 28:37.912
that you wanted to
focus on helping people.

28:37.914 --> 28:39.046
Yeah, OK, sorry.

28:39.048 --> 28:40.181
I changed my mind.

28:40.183 --> 28:41.415
Yeah, I see that.

28:41.417 --> 28:43.418
Oh, shit.

28:43.420 --> 28:45.386
Oh.

28:45.388 --> 28:47.090
God, damn it.

28:59.435 --> 29:00.235
Where is he?

29:00.237 --> 29:01.335
What happened?

29:01.337 --> 29:03.337
He swam into the
side of the pool.

29:03.339 --> 29:06.808
I just... I just took my eyes
off of him for a second.

29:06.810 --> 29:08.177
Hi, I'm Phil, Bill's dad.

29:08.179 --> 29:09.411
Hi, I'm Rose.

29:09.413 --> 29:10.411
It's nice to meet you.

29:10.413 --> 29:11.412
Nice to meet you.

29:11.414 --> 29:13.047
Oh, you're Rose.

29:13.049 --> 29:15.183
How sweet of you to come.

29:15.185 --> 29:16.651
We have heard so much about you.

29:16.653 --> 29:17.451
Oh.

29:17.453 --> 29:18.719
You are so pretty.

29:18.721 --> 29:19.688
Hey, hey.

29:19.690 --> 29:21.289
- You're very pretty.
- Oh...

29:21.291 --> 29:22.157
Hey, Robbie.

29:22.159 --> 29:23.725
Oh, my walking wounded.

29:23.727 --> 29:25.259
Oh, it's fine.

29:25.261 --> 29:26.594
I'm sure it's not
as bad as it looks.

29:26.596 --> 29:27.763
Oh, you're still gorgeous.

29:27.765 --> 29:29.664
Isn't he gorgeous, Rose?

29:29.666 --> 29:31.466
What, you stayed?

29:31.468 --> 29:33.270
Oh, that's so sweet.

29:36.272 --> 29:38.373
It's really... it's
not a big deal.

29:38.375 --> 29:41.142
Not the first time
Bill's dropped the ball.

29:41.144 --> 29:42.879
Sorry about that, Rob.

29:44.981 --> 29:45.913
All right, should we go?

29:45.915 --> 29:46.715
Yeah.

29:46.717 --> 29:47.583
Cool.

29:47.585 --> 29:48.616
Come on, Rose, come with us.

29:48.618 --> 29:49.418
I'll get the car.

29:49.420 --> 29:50.384
Nice to me you, finally.

29:50.386 --> 29:51.888
Nice to meet you, too.

30:05.736 --> 30:07.169
Hey, how do I look?

30:07.171 --> 30:09.470
Great.

30:09.472 --> 30:11.038
You look really strong.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.975
TV: Focused, determined.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.878
So it gives me great
pleasure to present

30:15.880 --> 30:21.216
him with this check for $6,548.

30:21.218 --> 30:22.183
...to the Out of sight...

30:22.185 --> 30:24.253
You have a mirror face.

30:24.255 --> 30:25.254
What?

30:25.256 --> 30:26.488
You have a face
that you make when

30:26.490 --> 30:28.524
you're looking in the mirror.

30:31.261 --> 30:33.027
What kind of face am I making?

30:33.029 --> 30:34.831
Like a regal bunny.

30:37.768 --> 30:41.269
Dah, crowd loved
it when I did that.

30:41.271 --> 30:43.537
Yeah, you're a really
good public speaker.

30:43.539 --> 30:46.307
Lots of practice.

30:46.309 --> 30:48.876
You want to see my mirror face?

30:48.878 --> 30:50.380
Sure.

30:52.615 --> 30:54.751
Do you want to
stay over tonight?

30:56.819 --> 31:00.721
Might be a good idea
in case I pass out.

31:00.723 --> 31:02.891
I'm injured.

31:02.893 --> 31:04.359
Right, yeah.

31:04.361 --> 31:07.296
OK.

31:07.298 --> 31:08.764
You want to see my room?

31:08.766 --> 31:10.567
Sure.

31:26.215 --> 31:30.384
ROBBIE: Hey, I want
to show you something.

31:30.386 --> 31:32.388
ROSE: Wow, that's big.

31:35.259 --> 31:37.726
ROBBIE: Yeah, I got
that one for archery.

31:37.728 --> 31:42.433
And that one's for tennis,
um, skiing, soccer.

32:10.461 --> 32:12.094
So how's it going with Rose?

32:12.096 --> 32:15.596
Oh good, really good.

32:15.598 --> 32:18.366
Yeah, she seems nice.

32:18.368 --> 32:19.901
I even kind of
like her birthmark.

32:19.903 --> 32:22.437
What birthmark?

32:22.439 --> 32:24.241
She's got a birthmark.

32:26.076 --> 32:27.942
Where?

32:27.944 --> 32:28.744
On her cheek.

32:28.746 --> 32:29.811
It's interesting.

32:29.813 --> 32:31.546
It's kind of like the
shape of Kentucky.

32:31.548 --> 32:34.350
Well, I hope it's not gross.

32:36.119 --> 32:38.621
I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

32:40.891 --> 32:42.693
Sorry.

32:56.140 --> 33:00.542
So you didn't tell me
about your birthmark.

33:00.544 --> 33:03.010
I don't have a birthmark.

33:03.012 --> 33:06.014
Bill says you have a
birthmark on your cheek.

33:06.016 --> 33:08.583
No.

33:08.585 --> 33:11.719
You thought I had a birthmark?

33:11.721 --> 33:14.992
Maybe you just had like ketchup
on your face or something.

33:52.028 --> 33:53.795
You OK?

33:53.797 --> 33:58.365
Yeah, I just don't
really like boats.

33:58.367 --> 34:00.469
You should tell
me and get seasick.

34:00.471 --> 34:01.268
I did.

34:01.270 --> 34:03.674
He told me to push through.

34:06.175 --> 34:08.577
You're doing great, Rob.

34:08.579 --> 34:09.811
What?

34:09.813 --> 34:12.646
I just said you're doing great.

34:12.648 --> 34:14.449
I know.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.554
You know, you've
been very helpful

34:19.556 --> 34:22.224
with all the swim stuff.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.592
Seriously.

34:23.594 --> 34:27.329
If left to my own devices, I
would just be at home all day

34:27.331 --> 34:28.862
doing nothing at all.

34:28.864 --> 34:29.929
I'm actually quite lazy.

34:29.931 --> 34:31.967
I don't know if you
know that about me.

34:31.969 --> 34:33.501
You're not lazy at all.

34:33.503 --> 34:34.735
Oh, no, I am.

34:34.737 --> 34:36.539
I just hide it pretty well.

34:39.876 --> 34:43.512
What would be your perfect day?

34:43.514 --> 34:48.782
Uh, I get up and I have
some toast with butter

34:48.784 --> 34:51.253
and a cup of tea.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.356
And my boss has called
because he wants

34:54.358 --> 34:58.193
me to watch Cheers
and the Golden Girls,

34:58.195 --> 35:00.327
and maybe Roseanne
if I have time.

35:00.329 --> 35:01.530
For your work.

35:01.532 --> 35:05.333
Yes, oh, because I watch
TV on behalf of the poor.

35:05.335 --> 35:07.970
Well, that's very good of you.

35:10.773 --> 35:12.773
Whoa, there, you're
going to capsize.

35:12.775 --> 35:13.775
It's a white squall.

35:13.777 --> 35:14.775
Will you fucking stop?

35:14.777 --> 35:17.278
Stop it.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.249
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:22.152 --> 35:23.617
I don't get it.

35:23.619 --> 35:24.418
He gets everything.

35:24.420 --> 35:25.220
He's the hero.

35:25.222 --> 35:27.789
He's the amazing Robbie.

35:27.791 --> 35:29.691
He ain't that amazing.

35:29.693 --> 35:30.791
You should just
tell him you ain't

35:30.793 --> 35:32.193
going to do his stupid swim.

35:32.195 --> 35:35.630
Oh, yeah, and just cancel
out the last 18 years.

35:35.632 --> 35:38.333
Can you imagine how
that would make me look?

35:38.335 --> 35:40.401
Who gives a shit
what you look like?

35:40.403 --> 35:43.771
Take the girl, man.

35:43.773 --> 35:46.041
How can I do that when
he's got everything?

35:46.043 --> 35:48.209
You can see the bitch.

35:48.211 --> 35:50.445
Damn, man.

35:50.447 --> 35:53.949
We've got to figure out a way
to make you seem more masculine.

35:53.951 --> 35:55.849
You lift weights?

35:55.851 --> 35:57.653
Not very heavy ones.

36:01.557 --> 36:04.159
Why do you have a Bible?

36:04.161 --> 36:05.193
Girls like dudes with Bibles.

36:05.195 --> 36:06.628
Whatchu mean?

36:06.630 --> 36:09.764
Oh, you've got a gun?

36:09.766 --> 36:11.566
No, I don't have a gun.

36:11.568 --> 36:13.370
I've got a gun.

36:15.706 --> 36:16.905
What?

36:16.907 --> 36:19.074
Oh, because I'm blind
I can't have a gun?

36:19.076 --> 36:21.476
No, you got a little blunt
like right on your front

36:21.478 --> 36:22.276
tooth right here.

36:22.278 --> 36:23.845
Oh.

36:23.847 --> 36:24.813
Huh?

36:24.815 --> 36:25.613
You got it.

36:25.615 --> 36:27.182
Good looking out.

36:27.184 --> 36:29.050
Yeah, let me hit that.

36:29.052 --> 36:31.286
Let me hit that blunt.

36:31.288 --> 36:33.287
Let me hit that blunt.

36:33.289 --> 36:35.090
Yeah, they're
called nutritiarians.

36:35.092 --> 36:37.659
And it's not about the
counting of the calories,

36:37.661 --> 36:38.994
it's about the quality
of the calories.

36:38.996 --> 36:40.262
Right.

36:40.264 --> 36:42.429
I mean, I keep telling
people about this and no one...

36:42.431 --> 36:44.699
no one seems to be listening.

36:44.701 --> 36:46.834
I mean, OK, for instance,
you want 30% to 60%

36:46.836 --> 36:47.869
of your diet to be vegetables...

36:47.871 --> 36:50.438
Watch out.
[engine rumbles] Watch out.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.238
You guys OK?

36:51.240 --> 36:52.039
Yeah.

36:52.041 --> 36:53.307
I'll be right back.

36:53.309 --> 36:55.242
Watch what you're doing, bro.

36:55.244 --> 36:57.311
You're coming at us, you
almost knocked us over.

36:57.313 --> 36:58.612
You don't tell me what to do.

36:58.614 --> 36:59.648
No, you listen.

36:59.650 --> 37:00.615
I don't tell me...
you don't tell me...

37:00.617 --> 37:02.119
Oh!

37:04.588 --> 37:05.387
Are you OK?

37:05.389 --> 37:06.820
Yeah.

37:06.822 --> 37:08.423
Like... just is it broken?

37:08.425 --> 37:10.191
No, I think it's
probably just bruised.

37:10.193 --> 37:12.260
You've got to move
your fingers around.

37:12.262 --> 37:13.193
Like that?

37:13.195 --> 37:13.994
Does that hurt?

37:13.996 --> 37:14.862
Bill, you OK?

37:14.864 --> 37:15.664
Yeah, yeah I'm fine.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.432
Thank you for defending me.

37:17.434 --> 37:19.034
How's he doing?

37:19.036 --> 37:20.837
Bill, could you check on him?

37:24.675 --> 37:25.639
I'm done, man.

37:25.641 --> 37:26.907
He can have her.

37:26.909 --> 37:29.144
She's got real
co-dependency issues.

37:29.146 --> 37:30.478
I'm never going to
beat him because, you

37:30.480 --> 37:33.248
know, nothing trumps it.

37:33.250 --> 37:34.648
Nothing.

37:34.650 --> 37:37.686
Nothing trumps what?

37:37.688 --> 37:39.387
Yo, I can't believe
he hit you, Norman.

37:39.389 --> 37:41.155
That's messed up.

37:41.157 --> 37:42.557
He's strong, man.

37:42.559 --> 37:46.094
I mean, for a blind guy, he's
really got a good swing, man.

37:46.096 --> 37:48.896
[sirens] Oh, shit.

37:48.898 --> 37:49.697
No, we're good.

37:49.699 --> 37:51.865
It's all right.

37:51.867 --> 37:53.101
What do we got
going on here, guys?

37:53.103 --> 37:54.436
Shit.
Fuck.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.235
Fuck.

37:55.237 --> 37:56.403
Shit.

37:56.405 --> 37:57.738
Nothing, officer.

37:57.740 --> 37:59.242
Just hanging out.

38:01.411 --> 38:03.113
Oh, hey GT.

38:10.353 --> 38:12.254
Your mom's here.

38:15.891 --> 38:18.126
Has GT been released yet?

38:18.128 --> 38:19.059
We didn't charge him.

38:19.061 --> 38:20.564
Right.

38:34.677 --> 38:36.478
It was like $10 worth of weed.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.281
It's not a big deal.

38:40.282 --> 38:43.185
Not everything's
about you, Bill.

38:48.291 --> 38:50.825
Your brother's
had some bad news.

38:50.827 --> 38:52.696
Oh yeah, what's that?

38:56.132 --> 38:58.566
The swim's not happening.

38:58.568 --> 38:59.833
Huh?

38:59.835 --> 39:01.936
It's not happening.

39:01.938 --> 39:03.740
How come?

39:06.710 --> 39:10.912
Because the the Coast Guard
and the good people of Lorain

39:10.914 --> 39:15.883
aren't willing to let a
blind guy into the water.

39:15.885 --> 39:19.354
They say it's too
dangerous and they're not

39:19.356 --> 39:22.993
insured for that kind of thing.

39:26.195 --> 39:27.362
So you're not going
to swim at all?

39:27.364 --> 39:29.530
Jesus, what part of this
don't you understand?

39:29.532 --> 39:30.398
Yes, Bill.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.066
It is not going to happen.

39:32.068 --> 39:34.601
The swim is off.

39:34.603 --> 39:36.405
You happy now?

39:42.144 --> 39:46.383
[music playing]

39:53.056 --> 39:54.857
Looking good, girl.

40:03.833 --> 40:04.965
Hi.

40:04.967 --> 40:07.668
Sh.

40:07.670 --> 40:09.505
We're trying to listen to this.

40:10.407 --> 40:12.209
What is it?

40:14.543 --> 40:16.577
It's Crime and Punishment.

40:16.579 --> 40:20.949
Crime and Punishment,
that sounds fun.

40:20.951 --> 40:22.383
Well, that's not
the point, Bill.

40:22.385 --> 40:24.552
It's not always
about having fun.

40:24.554 --> 40:28.490
It's about culture and
enriching yourself.

40:28.492 --> 40:29.289
Got it.

40:29.291 --> 40:32.092
With literature and art.

40:32.094 --> 40:32.894
You got it?

40:32.896 --> 40:33.695
Mmhmm.

40:33.697 --> 40:35.563
Great.

40:35.565 --> 40:36.498
Sorry.

40:36.500 --> 40:37.699
That's OK.

40:37.701 --> 40:39.133
AUDIOBOOK: And he will
hold out his hands to us.

40:39.135 --> 40:40.901
And we shall fall
down before him.

40:40.903 --> 40:43.972
And we shall we and we
shall understand all things.

40:43.974 --> 40:46.173
Then we shall understand all.

40:46.175 --> 40:48.376
And all will understand...

40:48.378 --> 40:50.211
Let's go out.

40:50.213 --> 40:52.246
Seriously, you need to
blow off some steam.

40:52.248 --> 40:55.282
You need to have a couple
beers and eat some processed

40:55.284 --> 40:59.454
food, something delicious like
chicken fingers

40:59.456 --> 41:02.757
or potato skins.

41:02.759 --> 41:05.059
Wh... where would we go?

41:05.061 --> 41:07.795
Do some dancing, some
drinking, some dinner.

41:07.797 --> 41:09.162
What, just the three of us?

41:09.164 --> 41:10.264
Sure.

41:10.266 --> 41:12.032
Unless Rose has a
young lady that she

41:12.034 --> 41:14.336
would like to introduce me to.

41:17.039 --> 41:18.805
Yeah.

41:18.807 --> 41:20.307
Yeah.

41:20.309 --> 41:22.111
Great.

41:27.851 --> 41:29.486
Hi, you're up front with me.

41:32.655 --> 41:33.454
Hi.

41:33.456 --> 41:34.354
Hi, I'm Bill.

41:34.356 --> 41:35.155
I'm Francie.

41:35.157 --> 41:36.657
Nice to meet you, Francie.

41:36.659 --> 41:37.691
Nice to meet you.

41:37.693 --> 41:39.194
Hi, guys.

41:48.304 --> 41:50.737
So we all up for some
drinks before dinner?

41:50.739 --> 41:51.673
I certainly am.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.041
Well, that's good news.

41:53.043 --> 41:54.742
And how do you feel
about dancing, Francie?

41:54.744 --> 41:56.376
I feel pretty
great about dancing.

41:56.378 --> 41:57.811
Also good to hear.

41:57.813 --> 41:59.646
Yep, sounds like a plan.

41:59.648 --> 42:01.416
South Road's coming up.

42:01.418 --> 42:02.749
Yep, I know.

42:02.751 --> 42:06.253
And we should be passing the
lobster mailbox on our right

42:06.255 --> 42:09.257
just about... now.

42:09.259 --> 42:11.693
Oh my god.

42:11.695 --> 42:13.193
Holy shit.

42:13.195 --> 42:14.695
Bill, stop the car.

42:14.697 --> 42:16.363
- You sure about that, Robbie?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:16.365 --> 42:18.398
It's fine. Stop the car.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.202
All right.

42:24.039 --> 42:25.841
What are we doing?

42:30.213 --> 42:32.015
Get ready for fun.

42:34.083 --> 42:35.682
- Hey.
- Oh, it's all right.

42:35.684 --> 42:36.617
I got it.

42:36.619 --> 42:38.385
What's going on?

42:38.387 --> 42:39.220
I'm driving.

42:39.222 --> 42:40.921
Get in.

42:40.923 --> 42:42.425
OK.

42:46.695 --> 42:49.162
Um, how are you doing this?

42:49.164 --> 42:50.430
He's peeking
through his eyelids.

42:50.432 --> 42:53.467
I have pretty advanced
spatial awareness and memory.

42:53.469 --> 42:54.969
- There's a car coming.
- It's OK, I got it.

42:54.971 --> 42:55.936
I got it.
I got it.

42:55.938 --> 42:57.871
FRANCIE: I don't like this.

42:57.873 --> 43:04.278
[yelling]

43:04.280 --> 43:05.313
See, everybody's fine.

43:05.315 --> 43:06.414
Stop.

43:06.416 --> 43:07.715
- How are you guys doing?
- Robbie, it's not...

43:07.717 --> 43:08.615
What's going on back here?

43:08.617 --> 43:11.052
This is stupid.

43:11.054 --> 43:12.153
See, it doesn't matter.

43:12.155 --> 43:13.487
I can go like this.

43:13.489 --> 43:14.789
It's the same as
if I'm like this.

43:14.791 --> 43:15.590
FRANCIE: Uh huh.

43:15.592 --> 43:16.791
Or like that.

43:16.793 --> 43:18.025
Somebody should be looking
at where we're going.

43:18.027 --> 43:19.961
BILL: Robbie, can you do
it with your eyes closed?

43:19.963 --> 43:23.732
[music playing]

43:43.018 --> 43:46.119
We should start a petition, get
the whole community behind me.

43:46.121 --> 43:47.255
Yeah.

43:47.257 --> 43:48.856
Bill thinks it would be
better coming from me,

43:48.858 --> 43:50.958
a passionate plea of sorts.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.662
Uh huh, I think so.

43:58.068 --> 44:00.568
He and Francie seem
to be getting along.

44:00.570 --> 44:03.970
Might finally be
about to get laid.

44:03.972 --> 44:05.572
But he must have a lot
of girlfriends, right?

44:05.574 --> 44:06.807
No, not at all.

44:06.809 --> 44:08.775
He's only brought one
person home in the last year

44:08.777 --> 44:10.978
and she wouldn't even
give him her number.

44:10.980 --> 44:12.246
Your table is ready.

44:12.248 --> 44:13.750
Thank you.

44:16.152 --> 44:18.019
Guys, it's dinner time.

44:18.021 --> 44:20.123
Hi, it's time for dinner.

44:24.728 --> 44:26.661
I really like him.

44:26.663 --> 44:27.929
We could marry brothers.

44:27.931 --> 44:29.664
And then we could live in
houses next to each other

44:29.666 --> 44:32.566
with a tunnel underneath.

44:32.568 --> 44:33.367
Yeah?

44:33.369 --> 44:34.635
All right.

44:34.637 --> 44:37.440
So, who's better
looking, Rose or Francie?

44:45.882 --> 44:46.680
Thank you.

44:46.682 --> 44:47.648
You're welcome.

44:47.650 --> 44:49.583
Thank you.

44:49.585 --> 44:50.684
Thank you.

44:50.686 --> 44:52.488
And a wine list as well.

44:54.090 --> 44:57.124
Your waitress will be over
to take your order shortly.

44:57.126 --> 45:00.461
This is awkward because
that gentleman lied to you.

45:00.463 --> 45:02.028
I will be your
waitress this evening.

45:02.030 --> 45:03.363
Great.

45:03.365 --> 45:06.666
I would like a huge martini
and I want you to get in it.

45:06.668 --> 45:08.470
No problem.

45:10.306 --> 45:11.171
More wine, Francie?

45:11.173 --> 45:15.041
Uh, yeah, thank you.

45:15.043 --> 45:16.878
Little more.

45:16.880 --> 45:23.950
[yell] [yell]

45:23.952 --> 45:26.954
What the fuck is that?

45:26.956 --> 45:28.889
Excuse me, do you mind?

45:28.891 --> 45:30.724
I'm trying to eat
dinner over here.

45:30.726 --> 45:32.059
Rob, he's disabled.

45:32.061 --> 45:33.894
I'm disabled.

45:33.896 --> 45:35.295
Oh my god.

45:35.297 --> 45:38.499
So Francie, do you do a bunch of
volunteer stuff like Rose does?

45:38.501 --> 45:39.300
Oh, no.

45:39.302 --> 45:41.034
I'm a much worse person.

45:41.036 --> 45:44.338
In my free time I
mostly just watch TV.

45:44.340 --> 45:45.639
As a person that's
been on TV, I

45:45.641 --> 45:47.307
can tell you it's
very effective,

45:47.309 --> 45:48.976
recognizability-wise.

45:48.978 --> 45:50.778
Robbie's been on the
local news a bunch.

45:50.780 --> 45:51.646
Really, have you?

45:51.648 --> 45:52.445
Wow.

45:52.447 --> 45:53.680
6 times, 4 years.

45:53.682 --> 45:56.950
You must get recognized
on the street all the time.

45:56.952 --> 45:59.086
Some people think
it's, like, excessive.

45:59.088 --> 46:03.657
But I... I'm kind of like,
eh, I could do better.

46:03.659 --> 46:05.025
Mmhmm.
[interposing voices]

46:05.027 --> 46:06.126
Rose?
Hi.

46:06.128 --> 46:06.927
Rita.

46:06.929 --> 46:08.461
Oh, no, don't get up.

46:08.463 --> 46:09.262
No, please.

46:09.264 --> 46:11.231
Funny to see you here.

46:11.233 --> 46:12.300
How have you been?

46:12.302 --> 46:13.099
I'm just fine.

46:13.101 --> 46:14.401
How have you been?

46:14.403 --> 46:15.436
We're managing.

46:15.438 --> 46:16.237
Sure.

46:16.239 --> 46:17.137
Sure.

46:17.139 --> 46:19.039
We've missed you.

46:19.041 --> 46:20.907
Hi, I'm Robbie.

46:20.909 --> 46:22.376
I'm Rose's boyfriend.

46:22.378 --> 46:23.880
He's blind.

46:27.016 --> 46:29.016
Well, nice to meet you.

46:29.018 --> 46:30.650
Nice to see you both.

46:30.652 --> 46:32.586
We'll let you get
on with your dinner.

46:32.588 --> 46:34.089
Bye.

46:50.106 --> 46:52.408
Why'd you tell
them I was blind?

46:57.313 --> 46:58.112
Rose?

46:58.114 --> 46:59.616
Um.

47:01.617 --> 47:05.052
Those were Fred's parents.

47:05.054 --> 47:07.287
Who is Fred?

47:07.289 --> 47:09.257
Fred's the boy that died.

47:09.259 --> 47:11.458
OK, but why did you
tell them I was blind?

47:11.460 --> 47:15.563
I wasn't expecting to see them
and I think I just got... I'm

47:15.565 --> 47:17.231
kind of flustered and confused.

47:17.233 --> 47:19.499
Did you think the fact that
I was blind would make it seem

47:19.501 --> 47:20.967
less like you'd
moved on and more

47:20.969 --> 47:22.603
like you're doing a good deed?

47:22.605 --> 47:23.970
No, not at all.

47:23.972 --> 47:27.541
I just... I, um... I just was not.

47:27.543 --> 47:29.043
Because I don't
need your pity, Rose.

47:29.045 --> 47:30.510
I know, and that's
not what this is.

47:30.512 --> 47:31.311
Oh, OK.

47:31.313 --> 47:32.112
So what is it?

47:32.114 --> 47:34.082
I just fucked up.

47:36.085 --> 47:36.950
Rob, don't go.

47:36.952 --> 47:38.552
Robbie, I'm sorry.

47:38.554 --> 47:39.720
I really didn't
mean yell at you.

47:39.722 --> 47:40.921
I'm just overwhelmed.

47:40.923 --> 47:42.123
- Robbie, please don't leave.
- Why?

47:42.125 --> 47:42.923
Why not?

47:42.925 --> 47:44.525
That was way out of line.

47:44.527 --> 47:45.458
I am so sorry.

47:45.460 --> 47:46.559
Why?

47:46.561 --> 47:48.662
Because I made a really
weird, bad mistake.

47:48.664 --> 47:49.697
A weird what?

47:49.699 --> 47:51.032
I did not want to
hurt your feelings.

47:51.034 --> 47:52.166
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

47:52.168 --> 47:53.133
Why are you sorry?

47:53.135 --> 47:54.668
- I'm sorry because I... I'm...
- Why?

47:54.670 --> 47:55.702
Because I don't want to
make you feel that way.

47:55.704 --> 47:56.503
Why not?

47:56.505 --> 47:57.604
Because I... I love you.

47:57.606 --> 47:58.539
What?

47:58.541 --> 48:00.343
I love you.

48:06.349 --> 48:08.151
Sorry.

48:10.085 --> 48:13.019
I... I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

48:13.021 --> 48:14.487
Really?

48:14.489 --> 48:15.655
Yeah.

48:15.657 --> 48:16.456
I'm sorry.

48:16.458 --> 48:19.626
No, I'm sorry.

48:19.628 --> 48:23.030
You shouldn't apologize to me.

48:23.032 --> 48:24.834
You love me.

48:26.469 --> 48:28.702
See, folks, I'm irresistible.

48:28.704 --> 48:31.371
It's just a fact.

48:31.373 --> 48:33.242
Everyone, enjoy their dinner.

48:35.945 --> 48:37.447
Ah.

48:39.514 --> 48:41.514
So Francie, why
don't you tell me, so

48:41.516 --> 48:44.418
far, what do you think of Bill?

48:44.420 --> 48:46.854
What do I think of Bill?

48:46.856 --> 48:48.054
Um, well...

48:48.056 --> 48:50.523
Um, you know what,
I actually, I'm

48:50.525 --> 48:53.159
going to just hit the
ladies room, just for a sec.

48:53.161 --> 48:54.327
- OK.
- Sorry.

48:54.329 --> 48:55.832
Excuse me.

49:01.269 --> 49:03.071
Rose.

49:05.775 --> 49:06.574
Rose.

49:06.576 --> 49:08.809
Yes?

49:08.811 --> 49:09.744
Will you let me in, please?

49:09.746 --> 49:11.144
No.

49:11.146 --> 49:13.613
Well, I'm just going to stand
out here until you let me in.

49:13.615 --> 49:15.417
Great.

49:27.063 --> 49:28.729
You OK?

49:28.731 --> 49:30.563
Yes, I'm fine.

49:30.565 --> 49:34.367
I'm fine... I'm
using the bathroom.

49:34.369 --> 49:35.802
You can't be with
someone just because you

49:35.804 --> 49:38.972
don't want hurt their feelings.

49:38.974 --> 49:41.108
I can't believe you just
are busting into a bathroom

49:41.110 --> 49:43.010
and trying to be a
hero but you really

49:43.012 --> 49:44.378
don't know what you're doing.

49:44.380 --> 49:46.546
And I'm not... whatever
you think it is...

49:46.548 --> 49:49.349
I'm a very difficult person.

49:49.351 --> 49:50.751
And I'm hurtful.

49:50.753 --> 49:54.988
And I'm vain and selfish
and a million bad things.

49:54.990 --> 49:56.590
I don't think you love him.

49:56.592 --> 49:58.059
Who am I to decide, though?

49:58.061 --> 49:58.992
You are.

49:58.994 --> 50:01.463
You are the one
to decide for you.

50:05.434 --> 50:08.836
Excuse me, sir, I'm
going to have to ask

50:08.838 --> 50:10.704
you to leave the restroom.

50:10.706 --> 50:11.505
Coming

50:11.507 --> 50:13.975
You can't be in there, sir.

50:29.425 --> 50:32.060
So you and Bill seem close.

50:36.264 --> 50:38.400
Why did you even invite me?

50:48.110 --> 50:50.110
What is up her ass?

50:50.112 --> 50:50.911
Nothing.

50:50.913 --> 50:52.045
Stop.

50:52.047 --> 50:53.880
Well then, why didn't
she want to come back?

50:53.882 --> 50:55.782
Because she's tired.

50:55.784 --> 50:58.418
Bill, you can do better.

50:58.420 --> 51:00.253
Francie's great.

51:00.255 --> 51:02.224
Not that great.

51:12.201 --> 51:14.334
We have to talk
about this right now.

51:14.336 --> 51:15.603
No.

51:15.605 --> 51:17.838
Feels so weird not
training for something.

51:17.840 --> 51:20.407
I feel like I'm seizing up.

51:20.409 --> 51:21.708
I don't even feel
like me anymore.

51:21.710 --> 51:22.510
It's weird.

51:22.512 --> 51:24.247
I bet.

51:26.481 --> 51:27.947
Stop.

51:27.949 --> 51:29.650
Stop chasing me around.

51:29.652 --> 51:31.153
[inaudible]

51:36.391 --> 51:38.892
What's going on in there?

51:38.894 --> 51:39.894
Nothing.

51:39.896 --> 51:42.429
It sounds like
something's going on.

51:42.431 --> 51:44.566
No, it's nothing.

51:48.036 --> 51:49.637
You ever try one of these?

51:49.639 --> 51:50.871
No.

51:50.873 --> 51:51.671
You want to try?

51:51.673 --> 51:52.539
No.

51:52.541 --> 51:54.041
First time for everything.

51:54.043 --> 51:55.342
It's... I don't want to.

51:55.344 --> 51:58.479
Hey, do you think I could
sue them for discrimination.

51:58.481 --> 52:00.648
Who?

52:00.650 --> 52:02.016
Coast Guard.

52:02.018 --> 52:04.184
I mean, fuck them for deciding
what's too dangerous for me.

52:04.186 --> 52:05.985
I mean, just because you can
see it doesn't mean you're

52:05.987 --> 52:09.557
a stronger swimmer, right?

52:09.559 --> 52:11.391
You're not.

52:11.393 --> 52:13.026
I'm not what?

52:13.028 --> 52:15.963
You're not doing it.

52:15.965 --> 52:18.701
Yeah, I know I'm not
doing it, Rose, I get that.

52:21.336 --> 52:22.135
I don't care.

52:22.137 --> 52:23.170
Excuse me?

52:23.172 --> 52:24.704
And I don't, uh, nothing.

52:24.706 --> 52:25.539
Well, that's nice.

52:25.541 --> 52:27.340
Thanks, Rose.

52:27.342 --> 52:29.510
I don't think
you... just stop it.

52:29.512 --> 52:32.012
Oh, OK.

52:32.014 --> 52:34.748
Uh, fuck this.

52:34.750 --> 52:37.517
Listen, where are you going?

52:37.519 --> 52:38.452
Out.

52:38.454 --> 52:40.256
This is bullshit.

52:48.331 --> 52:49.929
Go away.

52:49.931 --> 52:51.231
No.

52:51.233 --> 52:53.032
I'm making a decision.

52:53.034 --> 52:54.001
Please go away.

52:54.003 --> 52:55.805
I can't.

53:04.079 --> 53:05.881
I'm sorry.

53:08.351 --> 53:10.985
I love you, Rose.

53:10.987 --> 53:12.788
I'm sorry.

53:25.701 --> 53:29.405
I'm sorry, Rose, I'm
in love with you.

54:03.306 --> 54:04.973
Hey, I have an idea.

54:08.443 --> 54:09.575
I'm going to do it anyway.

54:09.577 --> 54:11.512
I mean, they can't stop
me getting in the water.

54:11.514 --> 54:13.981
And if we don't tell them I'm
doing it, they won't even know.

54:13.983 --> 54:15.416
I mean, I don't need
their big boats,

54:15.418 --> 54:17.450
I've got you two guys, right?

54:17.452 --> 54:18.485
Yeah.

54:18.487 --> 54:20.653
I mean, it could be awesome.

54:20.655 --> 54:26.193
Like man against nature,
like me against the elements.

54:26.195 --> 54:31.965
And I'm... I'm sorry for...
for giving you a hard time.

54:31.967 --> 54:33.566
I mean, I know this
isn't totally your thing

54:33.568 --> 54:35.903
and you're just
looking out for me.

54:35.905 --> 54:38.271
I just... I didn't mean
to come on so strong.

54:38.273 --> 54:39.873
That's OK.

54:39.875 --> 54:41.141
I was just stressed.

54:41.143 --> 54:43.778
But I think this really
could be awesome.

54:46.681 --> 54:49.483
Don't you?

54:49.485 --> 54:50.986
Yes.

54:58.760 --> 55:03.229
Look, you know that I
really appreciate what you

55:03.231 --> 55:06.032
both have done for me, right?

55:06.034 --> 55:08.068
Totally.

55:08.070 --> 55:11.040
I mean, I know I couldn't
do it without you.

55:13.141 --> 55:16.476
Fuck danger, right?

55:16.478 --> 55:18.414
Yeah, fuck danger.

55:32.293 --> 55:33.760
Rose?

55:33.762 --> 55:35.263
Yes?

55:37.800 --> 55:39.599
Are you coming to bed?

55:39.601 --> 55:42.570
Yes, just a minute.

55:47.009 --> 55:51.811
Thanks you guys,
you're the best.

55:51.813 --> 55:55.850
[singing]

56:10.932 --> 56:12.699
Hi.

56:12.701 --> 56:14.502
Hi.

56:18.206 --> 56:20.941
Thank you for coming.

56:20.943 --> 56:24.380
I came for Robbie, not for you.

56:31.420 --> 56:34.223
Are you going to tell him
you're in love with his brother?

56:41.329 --> 56:43.131
Excuse me.

57:10.759 --> 57:12.226
Hey boys.

57:12.228 --> 57:15.929
Boys, the News crew is here.

57:15.931 --> 57:18.565
Hi, Robbie, Clarice
Singer with WKGU.

57:18.567 --> 57:20.266
Ah, Clarice.

57:20.268 --> 57:23.269
Might I say, you look
very beautiful today.

57:23.271 --> 57:25.238
I'm just kidding around.

57:25.240 --> 57:27.139
I'm sure you do, though.

57:27.141 --> 57:28.141
Aw, thank you.

57:28.143 --> 57:29.775
We'd like to do an
interview with you

57:29.777 --> 57:31.445
before and after, if we could.

57:31.447 --> 57:32.612
Great.

57:32.614 --> 57:34.213
Going to make me
a star, Clarice?

57:34.215 --> 57:35.148
That's the plan.

57:35.150 --> 57:35.949
OK.

57:35.951 --> 57:37.184
Just give me one second.

57:37.186 --> 57:38.284
Bill!

57:38.286 --> 57:39.586
Yeah.

57:39.588 --> 57:41.420
Why don't you go get
everything set up.

57:41.422 --> 57:44.992
I want to be ready to
go in about an hour.

57:44.994 --> 57:46.927
All right?

57:46.929 --> 57:47.994
Yeah, OK.

57:47.996 --> 57:50.130
OK.

57:50.132 --> 57:52.132
Sorry, Clarice, you've got
to keep your troops in line,

57:52.134 --> 57:53.801
you know what I'm saying?

58:03.978 --> 58:05.811
Bill, can you do me a favor?

58:05.813 --> 58:07.981
Leave more shit lying around
so I can injure myself

58:07.983 --> 58:09.148
before I get in the water.

58:09.150 --> 58:10.653
Thanks.

58:13.289 --> 58:15.722
Clarice seems nice.

58:15.724 --> 58:17.824
She's a real peach.

58:17.826 --> 58:19.191
Huh?

58:19.193 --> 58:20.927
She seems lovely.

58:20.929 --> 58:23.965
Just remember to triple
check everything, all right?

58:32.373 --> 58:33.173
What's this?

58:33.175 --> 58:34.173
What is this?

58:34.175 --> 58:35.309
That's the bull horn.

58:35.311 --> 58:37.244
All right.

58:37.246 --> 58:41.280
Towels, gloves,
wetsuit, life jackets.

58:41.282 --> 58:42.081
What's this?

58:42.083 --> 58:43.916
That's the rope.

58:43.918 --> 58:45.485
OK, well don't forget that.

58:45.487 --> 58:48.290
I don't want anything
going wrong today.

58:49.224 --> 58:51.124
Clarice, where do
you want me here?

58:51.126 --> 58:53.126
Where you are is great.

58:53.128 --> 58:53.927
Background OK?

58:53.929 --> 58:55.862
Yep, background's great.

58:55.864 --> 58:59.333
All of Robbie's warriors in
the background here with me.

58:59.335 --> 59:00.601
These are the best
fans in the world.

59:00.603 --> 59:02.568
I swear, they've been
with me the whole time.

59:02.570 --> 59:04.338
It's been a long road.

59:04.340 --> 59:06.773
You guys are the best.

59:06.775 --> 59:08.608
Seriously, thank you
for being here, guys.

59:08.610 --> 59:11.612
So Robbie, tell us what
you're doing here today.

59:11.614 --> 59:16.115
Well, Clarice, I'm here to swim
12.9 kilometers across the lake

59:16.117 --> 59:19.921
to raise money for the
Out of Sight foundation.

59:21.956 --> 59:25.691
Well, how will your
blindness affect this one?

59:25.693 --> 59:29.128
Uh, you know what,
it's a lot like golf.

59:29.130 --> 59:33.166
Big handicap, big head start.

59:33.168 --> 59:35.635
No, but seriously, I have a
pretty dependable navigation

59:35.637 --> 59:37.304
technique to help
me find my way.

59:37.306 --> 59:39.171
Hey, Bill.

59:39.173 --> 59:40.206
Yeah?

59:40.208 --> 59:41.907
Let's show them how
I get across, huh?

59:41.909 --> 59:42.708
OK.

59:42.710 --> 59:44.213
Check this out.

59:48.916 --> 59:50.182
OK, here we go.

59:50.184 --> 59:50.983
Left.

59:50.985 --> 59:54.487
[horn] Right.

59:54.489 --> 59:58.724
[horn] [horn] And.

59:58.726 --> 01:00:01.927
[horn] [horn] [horn]
That's danger.

01:00:01.929 --> 01:00:04.030
I hope I don't hear that one.

01:00:04.032 --> 01:00:06.099
And Bill's your
brother who's going

01:00:06.101 --> 01:00:07.800
to be rowing across with you?

01:00:07.802 --> 01:00:09.903
That's right, that's
right... hey, Bill,

01:00:09.905 --> 01:00:13.106
why don't you come
up here and join us.

01:00:13.108 --> 01:00:14.608
Bill, everybody.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:15.409
Here he comes.

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:16.543
This is my brother.

01:00:16.545 --> 01:00:17.677
I love this guy.

01:00:17.679 --> 01:00:19.545
You know, he's been with
me since the very start.

01:00:19.547 --> 01:00:21.815
Couldn't have done
it without him.

01:00:21.817 --> 01:00:24.050
You know, it's actually
Bill, who in a way,

01:00:24.052 --> 01:00:25.418
I have to thank for
all this because he

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.822
challenged me to a diving
competition back in '94.

01:00:28.824 --> 01:00:30.289
He won.

01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:33.226
I hit my head on the bottom
of the pool and went blind.

01:00:33.228 --> 01:00:34.760
So...

01:00:34.762 --> 01:00:38.231
OK, so Robbie, how much are
you hoping to raise today?

01:00:38.233 --> 01:00:41.434
Well, that's a tough
question because every dollar

01:00:41.436 --> 01:00:42.536
is a blessing.

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:43.936
Look, we're not going
to turn money away.

01:00:43.938 --> 01:00:47.039
If we raised just $1
today we'd be happy, OK?

01:00:47.041 --> 01:00:48.842
We're a grateful bunch.

01:00:48.844 --> 01:00:50.646
Bill?

01:00:53.481 --> 01:00:54.982
Bill.

01:00:59.987 --> 01:01:01.789
Can I come in?

01:01:05.427 --> 01:01:08.497
Well, I'm going to stand
here until you let me in.

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:21.743
I think we should tell him.

01:01:24.713 --> 01:01:25.612
Really?

01:01:25.614 --> 01:01:28.648
We'll tell him after the swim.

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:30.152
Bill?

01:01:34.822 --> 01:01:36.325
Hi.

01:01:38.193 --> 01:01:39.995
Everything OK?

01:01:41.929 --> 01:01:43.564
We should get going.

01:01:45.067 --> 01:01:46.868
OK.

01:01:56.043 --> 01:02:01.748
On your mark, get set.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:02.715
[gun shot]

01:02:02.717 --> 01:02:06.720
[cheering]

01:02:06.722 --> 01:02:11.894
[music playing]

01:03:08.449 --> 01:03:09.917
[horn]

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:39.548
[boat horn]

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.623
[horn] [horn]

01:03:50.057 --> 01:03:52.361
[horn] [horn]

01:04:04.739 --> 01:04:07.942
[boat horn]

01:04:15.182 --> 01:04:17.885
[horn] [horn]

01:04:21.155 --> 01:04:24.157
Robbie, stop, you're
going the wrong way.

01:04:24.159 --> 01:04:25.025
Well, make up your mind.

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.892
It's pretty much
straight across.

01:04:26.894 --> 01:04:27.693
No, I know.

01:04:27.695 --> 01:04:29.729
But there are other horns.

01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:31.097
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:31.099 --> 01:04:32.432
One for left.

01:04:32.434 --> 01:04:33.266
Two for right.

01:04:33.268 --> 01:04:35.200
Three for danger.

01:04:35.202 --> 01:04:37.403
It's pretty easy.

01:04:37.405 --> 01:04:39.505
There are other boats, Rob.

01:04:39.507 --> 01:04:43.610
Yeah, no shit, we're in
a lake where boats are.

01:04:43.612 --> 01:04:45.414
Jesus.

01:04:47.014 --> 01:04:51.686
[music playing]

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:12.871
Put that down.

01:05:12.873 --> 01:05:15.742
That's not yours.

01:05:15.744 --> 01:05:17.043
You saw that?

01:05:17.045 --> 01:05:18.979
Yeah, I saw it.

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.782
Leave it alone.

01:05:23.284 --> 01:05:27.988
[music playing]

01:05:30.759 --> 01:05:32.258
You're doing great, Rob.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.760
We're like halfway there.

01:05:34.762 --> 01:05:35.862
Water.

01:05:35.864 --> 01:05:37.365
Yeah.

01:05:44.306 --> 01:05:46.539
Any time today would be great.

01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:47.974
I can't find it.

01:05:47.976 --> 01:05:48.775
What?

01:05:48.777 --> 01:05:49.809
Just a minute.

01:05:49.811 --> 01:05:51.313
Oh fuck.

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:55.648
Oh my god.

01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:57.152
This...

01:05:59.353 --> 01:06:00.954
Oh.
Shit.

01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:01.820
Goddammit.

01:06:01.822 --> 01:06:03.322
Jesus.

01:06:03.324 --> 01:06:04.124
Get off of me.

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.025
No, you're hurt.

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:06.659
Bill, get off of me.

01:06:06.661 --> 01:06:07.894
It's against the rules.

01:06:07.896 --> 01:06:09.795
There are no rules, Robbie,
just get in the boat.

01:06:09.797 --> 01:06:12.731
Get the fuck off of me.

01:06:12.733 --> 01:06:14.967
Jesus, what's wrong
with you, man?

01:06:14.969 --> 01:06:18.104
You're so fucking
useless sometimes.

01:06:18.106 --> 01:06:19.304
I mean, what is it, man?

01:06:19.306 --> 01:06:20.405
What?

01:06:20.407 --> 01:06:23.142
What? You don't want to finish,
is that what it is?

01:06:23.144 --> 01:06:24.878
You're so jealous
of me it's pathetic.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.878
Guys, please.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.213
This is not going
to help anything.

01:06:27.215 --> 01:06:30.018
Is that not why you're
trying to fuck my girlfriend?

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:36.389
You know what, Bill, if you
really wanted her so bad,

01:06:36.391 --> 01:06:38.925
you could have just asked.

01:06:38.927 --> 01:06:40.726
She's really pretty easy.

01:06:40.728 --> 01:06:41.961
Watch your fucking mouth.

01:06:41.963 --> 01:06:43.463
Fuck you.

01:06:43.465 --> 01:06:46.566
You walk around pretending
to do all this shit for me

01:06:46.568 --> 01:06:50.670
but really it's just cause
you have nothing better to do.

01:06:50.672 --> 01:06:53.405
You don't have a life, man.

01:06:53.407 --> 01:06:54.641
Everybody knows it.

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:59.378
No one wants to say it, but
you are a fucking loser.

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:00.579
He doesn't mean that.

01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:02.782
Don't you tell me what I mean.

01:07:02.784 --> 01:07:04.918
Shame on you.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.519
Fine, why don't you finish
your bullshit swim on your own.

01:07:07.521 --> 01:07:08.320
I will.

01:07:08.322 --> 01:07:09.421
You're a selfish prick.

01:07:09.423 --> 01:07:10.255
I don't need you.

01:07:10.257 --> 01:07:11.825
And I hope you fucking drown.

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:12.624
Fuck you.

01:07:12.626 --> 01:07:14.129
Fuck you.

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:30.242
Bill.

01:07:30.244 --> 01:07:32.778
Bill.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.915
Bill, stop.

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:39.985
You can't leave
him in the water.

01:07:39.987 --> 01:07:41.487
OK.

01:07:41.489 --> 01:07:42.454
OK.

01:07:42.456 --> 01:07:44.158
OK, I'm sorry.

01:07:46.961 --> 01:07:49.061
Robbie.

01:07:49.063 --> 01:07:50.865
Robbie.

01:07:51.932 --> 01:07:53.398
Is that him?

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.202
Yeah, I think.

01:08:07.014 --> 01:08:07.848
Oh my god.

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:12.385
It's a fucking buoy.

01:08:12.387 --> 01:08:13.418
Oh god.

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:14.621
Robbie.

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:15.420
Where did he go?

01:08:15.422 --> 01:08:16.788
Why wasn't I watching him?

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:19.925
We need help.

01:08:19.926 --> 01:08:21.729
There's no signal.

01:08:23.465 --> 01:08:25.464
Someone help!

01:08:25.466 --> 01:08:27.466
Help us!

01:08:27.469 --> 01:08:31.138
[siren]

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.814
[music playing]

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:27.295
Rob.

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:36.068
Where are you, beautiful baby?

01:09:36.069 --> 01:09:37.703
Robbie.

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:39.506
Robbie.

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:44.576
Where are you?

01:09:44.578 --> 01:09:46.381
Robbie?

01:10:10.204 --> 01:10:12.007
Robbie.

01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:16.444
Robbie.

01:10:18.512 --> 01:10:20.879
Robbie.

01:10:20.881 --> 01:10:23.148
Bill.

01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:24.150
Oh god.

01:10:24.152 --> 01:10:26.052
Robbie.

01:10:26.054 --> 01:10:28.920
What are you doing here?

01:10:28.922 --> 01:10:30.322
I was looking for you.

01:10:30.324 --> 01:10:31.523
You left me.

01:10:31.525 --> 01:10:32.892
You swam off.

01:10:32.894 --> 01:10:34.794
You left me out here to die.

01:10:34.796 --> 01:10:37.732
No I didn't, you swam off.

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:43.803
Get in the boat.

01:10:43.805 --> 01:10:45.905
No, I'm waiting
for the Coast Guard.

01:10:45.907 --> 01:10:47.072
Don't be an asshole.

01:10:47.074 --> 01:10:48.241
Just get in the boat.

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:49.744
No.

01:11:10.364 --> 01:11:13.165
Robbie.

01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:15.034
Get in the boat.

01:11:15.036 --> 01:11:17.370
First you blind me then
you steal my girlfriend?

01:11:17.372 --> 01:11:19.138
It was a fucking accident.

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.407
Rose was not an accident.

01:11:22.409 --> 01:11:24.110
She's the girl.

01:11:24.112 --> 01:11:27.580
She's the girl who wouldn't
give me her number.

01:11:27.582 --> 01:11:29.551
And I love her.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.053
You shouldn't have done it.

01:11:34.055 --> 01:11:36.688
I know.

01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:38.156
I know I let you down.

01:11:38.158 --> 01:11:38.958
I fucked up.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.527
I'm sorry.

01:11:41.529 --> 01:11:44.062
Maybe I am jealous of you.

01:11:44.064 --> 01:11:47.769
Jesus Christ, you're so
fucking brave and I hate it.

01:11:50.204 --> 01:11:55.273
And I... I just hate how much
I let my life slip away.

01:11:55.275 --> 01:12:00.278
But I love you and I'm sorry.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.784
And please, please just get
on the boat with me, please.

01:12:07.055 --> 01:12:09.722
I'm so tired.

01:12:09.724 --> 01:12:11.022
I'm so tired.

01:12:11.024 --> 01:12:12.526
I'm right here.

01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:24.669
Here we are.

01:12:24.671 --> 01:12:25.905
Grab the boat.

01:12:25.907 --> 01:12:26.705
Grab it.

01:12:26.707 --> 01:12:28.208
Grab on.

01:13:02.944 --> 01:13:05.311
Is everyone still there?

01:13:05.313 --> 01:13:08.147
Yep.

01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:09.214
What about Mom?

01:13:09.216 --> 01:13:10.715
Is she freaking out?

01:13:10.717 --> 01:13:15.487
Yeah, I think she wants
to have me arrested.

01:13:15.489 --> 01:13:18.292
You know, everyone's
going to see me fail.

01:13:20.161 --> 01:13:21.259
You didn't fail.

01:13:21.261 --> 01:13:22.527
What are you talking about?

01:13:22.529 --> 01:13:24.665
I didn't make it across.

01:13:27.502 --> 01:13:29.571
What if you did?

01:13:46.087 --> 01:13:47.986
You sure you want to do this?

01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:49.489
Yeah.

01:13:54.462 --> 01:14:01.467
Hey, uh, don't think I
don't know that all of this

01:14:01.469 --> 01:14:04.571
is bullshit.

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.144
But I need it.

01:14:16.783 --> 01:14:18.586
Careful.

01:14:28.128 --> 01:14:29.797
You OK?

01:14:31.365 --> 01:14:38.070
You know, being blind
takes a lot of energy.

01:14:38.072 --> 01:14:42.409
And sometimes I don't have
enough space for other people.

01:14:44.679 --> 01:14:50.482
But I want you to know I
really do love you, Bill.

01:14:50.484 --> 01:14:52.287
Yep.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:56.590
But if you tell anyone about
this, I will have to kill you.

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:01.093
OK.

01:15:01.095 --> 01:15:03.161
All right, baby.

01:15:03.163 --> 01:15:05.466
You look beautiful, baby.

01:15:12.172 --> 01:15:17.345
[music playing]

01:15:34.595 --> 01:15:37.062
Now, Robbie, was there a moment
out there where you thought you

01:15:37.064 --> 01:15:39.031
wouldn't make it back to shore?

01:15:39.033 --> 01:15:40.199
Oh, absolutely.

01:15:40.201 --> 01:15:44.236
But you know, as always,
I had a conversation

01:15:44.238 --> 01:15:45.937
going with the man upstairs.

01:15:45.939 --> 01:15:46.805
You seen Rose?

01:15:46.807 --> 01:15:47.906
She left.

01:15:47.908 --> 01:15:50.409
It's like I always say,
strength in numbers,

01:15:50.411 --> 01:15:51.677
he's number one.

01:15:51.679 --> 01:15:53.411
Thank you, Robbie, thank
you for being an inspiration.

01:15:53.413 --> 01:15:54.580
- Hey, Francie.
- Uh huh?

01:15:54.582 --> 01:15:55.748
Have you seen Rose?

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:56.915
No.

01:15:56.917 --> 01:15:58.952
Did I say you were looking
very pretty tonight?

01:16:01.221 --> 01:16:03.054
Rose.

01:16:03.056 --> 01:16:04.690
Hello.

01:16:04.692 --> 01:16:06.194
Come in.

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:18.704
I just wanted to come
and see, you know,

01:16:18.706 --> 01:16:21.507
how you guys are doing.

01:16:21.509 --> 01:16:24.076
We're OK.

01:16:24.078 --> 01:16:24.876
It's hard.

01:16:24.878 --> 01:16:27.545
We miss him.

01:16:27.547 --> 01:16:34.253
There's been
something on my mind,

01:16:34.255 --> 01:16:40.326
which is that we were having
an argument when it happened.

01:16:40.328 --> 01:16:46.432
And that's why I think
he wasn't concentrating.

01:16:46.434 --> 01:16:53.938
So I feel very sorry about that.

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:54.940
What about?

01:16:54.942 --> 01:16:56.107
I'm sorry?

01:16:56.109 --> 01:16:57.643
What were you fighting about?

01:16:57.645 --> 01:17:00.345
Oh.

01:17:00.347 --> 01:17:02.784
We were breaking up.

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:10.388
He told me he was going
to but I didn't know

01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:12.157
whether he'd done it already.

01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:16.963
Fred did like you, he just
said you watched too much TV.

01:17:18.932 --> 01:17:21.500
No, I do.

01:17:21.502 --> 01:17:22.701
I do.

01:17:22.703 --> 01:17:25.839
Maybe he just wasn't
your special someone.

01:17:28.141 --> 01:17:33.314
[music playing]

01:18:02.009 --> 01:18:04.477
Rose.

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:05.977
Rose.

01:18:05.979 --> 01:18:07.979
Rose.

01:18:07.981 --> 01:18:10.482
Rose!

01:18:10.484 --> 01:18:11.450
Hi.

01:18:11.452 --> 01:18:12.951
Hi.

01:18:12.953 --> 01:18:14.053
Pull over.

01:18:14.055 --> 01:18:15.790
I love you.

01:18:26.367 --> 01:18:28.503
Am I paralyzed?

01:18:31.939 --> 01:18:34.673
Yes.

01:18:34.675 --> 01:18:36.375
Really?

01:18:36.377 --> 01:18:37.977
No.

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:39.480
No.

01:18:43.117 --> 01:18:45.017
But you do have a concussion.

01:18:45.019 --> 01:18:46.418
I have a concussion?

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:48.419
Yeah.

01:18:48.421 --> 01:18:51.224
It was very dramatic, though.

01:18:53.094 --> 01:18:56.629
Will you go out with me?

01:18:56.631 --> 01:19:00.699
You know, I've got a bad track
record going out with people.

01:19:00.701 --> 01:19:02.300
I know the risks.

01:19:02.302 --> 01:19:06.371
And what if one day I start
to find you very irritating.

01:19:06.373 --> 01:19:07.740
What about that?

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:10.509
You can dump me.

01:19:10.511 --> 01:19:15.748
But let's be honest, I
have world class nipples.

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:18.017
Stop.

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:20.251
And I'm nice to waiters.

01:19:20.253 --> 01:19:25.089
We just have to avoid buses and
other forms of mass transit.

01:19:25.091 --> 01:19:26.894
Right.

01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:30.865
You want to get up on the boat.

01:19:32.432 --> 01:19:33.199
Yes.

01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:34.702
All right.

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:48.449
Is my family here?

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.823
Robbie was hungry so they
went to get something to eat.

01:20:01.162 --> 01:20:01.960
Good.

01:20:01.962 --> 01:20:03.463
Yeah.

01:20:05.399 --> 01:20:10.134
Oh, we can watch TV.

01:20:10.136 --> 01:20:14.307
[music playing]

01:20:15.141 --> 01:20:17.041
It's the best boat ever.

01:20:17.043 --> 01:20:23.450
