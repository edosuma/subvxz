01:09.236 --> 01:11.203
Nope. Too bad he's not here.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.105
Ono could spot Ono for sure.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.040
Wait. There he is!

01:15.209 --> 01:16.208
And... Uh-oh.

He's not alone!

(SQUAWKS)

01:19.146 --> 01:20.345
Leaving so soon, Ono?

01:20.514 --> 01:23.449

to get a good look around.

01:42.136 --> 01:45.104
You won't be
so lucky next time!

01:45.139 --> 01:48.207
Yeah. We'll catch you
sooner or later.

01:48.409 --> 01:51.376
You guys couldn't catch
an updraft with both wings.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.247
Good going!

01:56.383 --> 01:59.451
Yeah! Mzingo and Mwoga got
a beak-full of dirt for lunch.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.321
Thanks. It was a little
too close for me.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.190
What'd you see, Ono?

02:05.226 --> 02:08.060
The crocs and jackals
are still in Kilio Valley.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.295
But the hyenas are
moving towards the volcano.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.164
Maybe Scar
has plans for Janja.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.332
Maybe.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.366
The vultures chased me off

02:14.401 --> 02:15.434
before I could
see anything else.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.169
Sorry Kion.

02:17.204 --> 02:18.270
It's okay, Ono.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.239
I'm just glad you
made it back in one piece.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.207
More or less.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.209
It doesn't matter
what Scar's planning.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.145
The Lion Guard'll beat him!

02:26.313 --> 02:27.446
I sure hope so, Little B.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.381
We need to stay alert.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.184
Scar could make
his next move any time now.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.445
Jackals? Hyenas?
Dung beetles?

03:01.081 --> 03:03.048
Uh, back there!

03:05.452 --> 03:06.418
Okay...

03:07.154 --> 03:08.420
So what's the problem?

03:09.056 --> 03:10.122
The rock.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.391
THURSTON:
The rock is the problem.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.027
Something must be
done about it.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.295
The rock.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.396
Okay.

03:18.132 --> 03:19.231
Let's go check it out.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.171

03:26.373 --> 03:27.372
There. We done?

03:27.408 --> 03:29.241
THURSTON:
You don't understand.

03:29.276 --> 03:30.409
It talked.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.344
The rock talked?

03:32.479 --> 03:34.479
It most certainly did.

03:35.149 --> 03:37.115
We all heard it. Didn't we?

03:37.251 --> 03:38.383
(NEIGHING IN AGREEMENT)

03:39.253 --> 03:40.452
A talking rock?

03:41.055 --> 03:42.154
Like my dad always says,

03:43.357 --> 03:44.456
"You never know
what you might see

03:46.193 --> 03:47.326

03:52.533 --> 03:54.333
That tree. Over there.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.368
I tried to scratch
my back against it

03:56.403 --> 03:57.502
and it yelled at me!

03:58.105 --> 03:59.104
It yelled at you?

03:59.306 --> 04:00.439
Yes! It said,

04:01.108 --> 04:03.108
"Careful. I'm standin' here."

04:03.310 --> 04:05.077
First a talking rock.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.445
Now a yelling tree.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.348
Next thing you know the grass
will be singing.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.049

04:11.085 --> 04:12.084
You don't have to...

04:12.119 --> 04:13.151

04:13.187 --> 04:16.388
Stop! Just calm down.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.468
I don't get it.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.004
I know the zebras
are easily spooked.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.138
But not Twiga.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.440
Yeah. Why would she
say she heard a voice?

04:36.043 --> 04:37.309
Unless she really did.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.278
Are you saying
the tree really talked?

04:40.114 --> 04:41.113
No, but...

04:41.148 --> 04:43.315
I think Twiga heard something.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.417
Perhaps it was
an animal cry from far away.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.086

great distances.

you never saw me.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.403
I think we just found

There she goes again.

05:55.422 --> 05:56.455
How does she do that.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.092
Now that I've seen her,
I can tell you exactly
how she does it.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.326
She's a chameleon.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.963
Chameleons change
their colors to blend in
with their surroundings.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.298
It makes them
almost invisible.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.133
Ow!

06:08.302 --> 06:09.301
Almost.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.302
Okay, you got me.

06:10.437 --> 06:11.436
Cool.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.004
Amazing.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.173
Nobody's ever been
able to see me before.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.042
Unless I get really scared.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.077
Then I turn
all kinds of crazy colors.

06:19.113 --> 06:23.014
Well, I could see you because
I am the keenest of sight.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.416
Keenest of sight?

06:25.152 --> 06:26.451
(GASPS) You must be Ono.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.087
You guys are the Lion Guard.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.089
Yep, you got that right!

06:31.125 --> 06:32.290
What's your name, chameleon?

06:32.326 --> 06:34.092
And why did you run from us?

06:34.228 --> 06:35.260
I'm Kinyonga.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.262
And I ran
because you chased me.

06:37.431 --> 06:38.997
Makes sense to me.

06:39.133 --> 06:41.066
Sorry if we scared you,
Kinyonga.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.136
We just wanted to know why
you were spooking
Twiga and the zebras.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.437
Oh, I didn't mean to.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.139
I was trying to be friendly.

06:47.341 --> 06:49.441
Sometimes I forget
that I'm camouflaged

Camo-what?

06:51.044 --> 06:52.544
Camouflage.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.147
It's what we chameleons
call it when we blend in with
what's around us.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.152
Ah, thanks.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.121
I was just doing what

Well Kinyonga,
you can color me impressed.

I'm impressed?

08:51.265 --> 08:52.230
Ugh!

08:52.399 --> 08:54.132
It's nice to meet you,
Kinyonga.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.401
But please be careful
when you're camouflaged.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.036
You might cause
another panic.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.971
Especially around zebras.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.240
I'll do my best not to
scare anyone else.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.009
I promise.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.143
Thank you.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.945
We've got enough to deal with
trying to figure out

09:06.980 --> 09:08.246
what the Outlanders
are gonna do next.

09:09.082 --> 09:12.183
Sorry I couldn't find out
more before
the vultures spotted me.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.618
It's okay, Ono.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.388
I know it's not
easy to slip into the Outlands
without being seen.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.023
Oh! Oh!

09:18.058 --> 09:19.024
KINYONGA: I could do that.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.459
I don't think so.

09:21.495 --> 09:24.996
There's some really bad stuff
going on in the Outlands.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.264
Oh, I know.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.365
Scar's back.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.100
You know about Scar?

09:29.136 --> 09:31.303
Yeah! I heard the skinks
talking about him.

09:31.438 --> 09:34.072
The skinks talked about Scar?

09:34.107 --> 09:35.106
Right in front of you?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.309
It's amazing what you hear
when nobody can see you.

09:38.245 --> 09:42.113
And Scar sounds like
bad news for everyone
in the Pride Lands.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.317
Let me go into the Outlands
and find out
what's going on for you.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.152
I've been there lots of times.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.987
Nobody sees me come or go.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.089
Scar's inside the volcano.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.258
There are bad guys
all over the place.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.193
What if one of them spots you?

09:55.228 --> 09:57.162
Why would they?
You guys didn't.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.375
I have to say,

20:44.510 --> 20:48.079
you are the nicest
talking rock I've ever met.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.580
KINYONGA: Thank you.

20:49.616 --> 20:53.050
And I must say you're
the handsomest zebra
I've ever met.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.452
(ZEBRAS TITTERING)

20:54.487 --> 20:57.488
Yes, well that's what
all the rocks say.

20:59.525 --> 21:00.458
Kinyonga!

21:01.361 --> 21:02.460
Oh, hi, everybody.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.195
Where'd you go last night?

21:05.298 --> 21:07.398
I thought you
might be mad at me.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.066
Why would we be mad?

21:09.235 --> 21:12.069
I scared those hyenas
and they fell in the river.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.438
I broke my promise
not to scare anyone.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.008
If it's Janja and his hyenas,

21:17.176 --> 21:18.142
scare away.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.310
Phew!

21:19.345 --> 21:20.478
I'm glad to hear that!

21:21.147 --> 21:22.346
But I won't scare
anybody else!

21:22.515 --> 21:25.483
Excuse me! Do you mind?

21:26.085 --> 21:28.152
I was chatting with my friend,

21:28.187 --> 21:29.253
the talking...

21:29.489 --> 21:30.454
Lizard?

21:31.090 --> 21:32.189
(SCREAMS)

21:32.225 --> 21:35.226
Panic and run! Panic and run!

21:35.261 --> 21:37.428
(ZEBRAS NEIGHING)

21:38.097 --> 21:39.163
Oh, no.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.298
I'm sorry.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.067
Not your fault.

21:43.236 --> 21:45.202
Lion Guard,
let's round 'em up.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.370
Again.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.172
Till the Pride Lands end...

21:48.207 --> 21:50.174
ALL: Lion Guard defend!
