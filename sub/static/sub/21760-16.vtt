Cadpig: Are you all aware that
tomorrow is Valentine's Day,

01:18.250 --> 01:20.920
a joyous celebration
of the power

01:20.920 --> 01:22.880
and importance
of love and friendship,

01:22.880 --> 01:25.210
and the ultimate guilt trip:

01:25.210 --> 01:26.710
the opportunity
to give a Valentine

01:26.710 --> 01:28.170
to someone who didn't
give you one

01:28.170 --> 01:31.040
and watch 'em squirm?!

01:31.040 --> 01:32.170
I love it!

01:32.170 --> 01:34.080
She scares me sometimes.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.500
Huh, only sometimes?

02:01.250 --> 02:05.120
Hey, what's Roger up to?
He's acting weird.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.080
Maybe he's got a wedgie.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.920
All right,
a mystery!

02:08.920 --> 02:10.170
Let's follow it.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.250
I did it, I did it!

02:24.040 --> 02:25.290
Whoa! Ugh!

02:25.290 --> 02:27.290
Hey! Ugh!

02:28.880 --> 02:31.040
I think I hear... music?

02:31.040 --> 02:33.170
Oh, no, he's not taking up

02:33.170 --> 02:34.250
the trombone again!

02:34.250 --> 02:36.040
Roger can do a lot of damage

02:36.040 --> 02:37.750
with a wind instrument.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.250
Last time
the chickens mutinied.

02:40.250 --> 02:42.250
It wasn't pretty.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.210
Roger,
why is this door locked?

02:49.210 --> 02:50.960
I need to use the computer.

02:50.960 --> 02:54.080
Now we'll see
what's going on.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.210
Now?

02:55.210 --> 02:56.830
Why not?

02:56.830 --> 02:59.620
Um, no reason.
Now's a great time.

02:59.620 --> 03:00.750
I guess.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.000
What's in the box, dear?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.880
What box?

03:04.880 --> 03:07.120
Oh, oh, you mean
this box?

03:07.120 --> 03:10.500
Oh, I'm, uh, working
on a new video game,

03:10.500 --> 03:13.000
the Hunchbox
or Notre Dame.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.500
Gotta go ring some bells.
See ya!

03:15.500 --> 03:19.330
That man is up to something.

03:19.330 --> 03:23.080
And we're gonna
find out what it is.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.170
Hmm.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.960
Not a single Valentine.

03:32.960 --> 03:37.040
Good. They take up too much room
in my mailbox anyway.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.080
Besides,
all those fattening sweets

03:41.080 --> 03:45.040
and drippy chocolate hearts
would ruin my girlish figure.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.210
Ugh!

03:50.170 --> 03:53.000
-Ohh!

03:53.000 --> 03:55.920
Valentines don't make
a real woman happy.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.040
Ugh! Only hippy.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.750
Now, where are
those two nimrods?

04:00.750 --> 04:03.790
Can't they see my mailbox
needs fixing?

04:09.790 --> 04:11.580
Careful.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.000
One loud noise,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.620
and the whole thing
will be ruined.

04:15.620 --> 04:18.080
Ohhh!

04:18.080 --> 04:20.920
Cruella: Jasper! Horace!

04:20.920 --> 04:22.540
-Aaaah!

04:22.540 --> 04:27.000
I hired you two to scrub
and dust, not use my kitchen!

04:32.330 --> 04:34.960
Yowwww!

04:37.000 --> 04:40.460
Burning... Ow-ow-ow!

04:40.460 --> 04:41.880
It was all his idea.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.040
He wanted to bake
a Valentine's Day cake.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.960
Valentine's Day cake?

04:45.960 --> 04:49.540
Why, you portly
little scamp.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.460
Whoever
is it for?

04:51.460 --> 04:53.830
Well, as soon as I put
the frosting on it,

04:53.830 --> 04:56.920
I was hoping that Nanny
might like it.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.830
Oh, Nanny... Nanny!

04:58.830 --> 05:01.000
You loathsome piece
of gristle.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.210
Get out of my kitchen!

05:02.210 --> 05:04.500
Be gone!

05:09.290 --> 05:13.080
Excuse me, ma'am, but could you
throw me the frosting?

05:13.080 --> 05:16.330
Hmm! Thank you, ma'am.

05:16.330 --> 05:17.830
Memo to myself.

05:17.830 --> 05:22.080
See to it that Valentine's Day
is wiped off the calendar!

05:32.170 --> 05:33.540
Whoa!

05:37.420 --> 05:39.120
Gotta clean that up.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.880
Whoa!

05:45.380 --> 05:46.460
Pick that up.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.120
Gotta clean that up.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.330
Ahh!

06:08.040 --> 06:09.580
Nooo!

06:12.000 --> 06:16.040
Oh, no, he's not gonna try
to hide it in the toolshed.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.000
Oh! I'm outta here.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.040
Me, too. I don't wanna be
around when the door opens.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.500
Where are you going?

06:23.500 --> 06:25.790
Well, discretion

06:25.790 --> 06:28.830
is the better part
of avoiding pain.

06:28.830 --> 06:29.920
Aaaah!

06:34.210 --> 06:38.210
Lucky: Things get a little tough
and everybody bails.

06:40.460 --> 06:41.830
All right!

06:41.830 --> 06:43.790
Now we'll get
to the bottom of this.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.460
Whoa!

06:51.830 --> 06:54.960
Roger's voice:
♪ You love me
and I love you ♪

06:54.960 --> 06:58.000

06:58.000 --> 07:00.880

07:00.880 --> 07:04.330

07:04.330 --> 07:05.830
A Valentine?

07:05.830 --> 07:09.460
Eww, gross!
Some big mystery.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.460
Dumpling: Oh, Lucky,
it's beautiful!

07:13.460 --> 07:14.670
Dumpling?

07:16.880 --> 07:19.290
And you couldn't even
wait till tomorrow

07:19.290 --> 07:20.790
to give it to me!

07:20.790 --> 07:21.830
But...

07:23.290 --> 07:26.790
Oh, it's got candy, too!

07:28.460 --> 07:30.790
It's not for you.

07:30.790 --> 07:33.920
Oh, don't be coy,
cuddle bumps.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.540
I don't mind getting
love loot early.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.920
But, Dumpling,
it's not for you!

07:38.920 --> 07:40.750
So let go!

07:42.750 --> 07:43.920
Whoa!

07:48.920 --> 07:52.330
Listen, sweet cheeks,
if that's for another girl,

07:52.330 --> 07:55.170
there's a pig
knuckle sandwich
with your name on it.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.880
Back off, Dumpling!

07:56.880 --> 07:59.580
It's for Anita,
from Roger.

07:59.580 --> 08:03.330
Hey, the Valentine.
Where is the Valentine?

08:03.330 --> 08:04.920
Oh, no!

08:11.880 --> 08:14.540
Scorch has
the neatest Valentine

08:14.540 --> 08:17.830
'cause I was nosing around
where I didn't belong.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.750
What a jerk!

08:19.750 --> 08:22.170
You can say
that again!

08:23.830 --> 08:25.920
Huh?

08:25.920 --> 08:29.250
Looks like I'm the one
who's gonna have to get it back.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.830
Roger :
I can't believe this!

08:37.830 --> 08:39.920
I finally remember to make
Anita's Valentine

08:39.920 --> 08:41.790
and this happens.

08:43.830 --> 08:45.420
Good job, Lucky.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.750
The anti-Cupid
strikes again.

08:47.750 --> 08:51.170
Come on, guys, you gotta help me
get it back.

08:52.750 --> 08:56.290
Excuse me. Scorch has it.

08:56.290 --> 08:58.380
Scorch eats chickens.

08:58.380 --> 08:59.670
Do you see a problem here?

08:59.670 --> 09:03.620
How about I just cheer you on
proudly from the sidelines?

09:03.620 --> 09:05.750
Besides, it's at Cruella's.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.880
Imagine what
she'll be doing to us

09:07.880 --> 09:10.710
while Scorch
is eating Spot.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.790
Ugh! Thanks for the visual.

09:12.790 --> 09:15.170
You won't be doing
this for me.

09:15.170 --> 09:16.710
You'll be doing it
for Roger,

09:16.710 --> 09:19.000
and Anita,
your country,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.120
the flag,
apple pie!

09:23.790 --> 09:26.000
Both: Huh?

09:26.000 --> 09:29.790
Cut to the chase, we're doing it
to save your butt!

09:29.790 --> 09:31.170
I can live with that.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.750
I can send myself flowers.

09:44.830 --> 09:47.040
Hello, Flowers

09:47.040 --> 09:49.620
I want to send myself
a bouquet, anonymously.

09:49.620 --> 09:53.080
Sign the card, "I love me!"

09:53.080 --> 09:57.540
No, I can't give you my name,
it would spoil the surprise!

10:01.960 --> 10:04.750
Nincompoops.

10:04.750 --> 10:07.750
♪ You love me

10:07.750 --> 10:10.880

10:10.880 --> 10:13.710
What is that horrible racket?

10:16.710 --> 10:18.580
-Scorch!

10:23.170 --> 10:24.790
It's a Valentine!

10:26.790 --> 10:30.080
Someone left me a Valentine!

10:30.080 --> 10:32.500
There's only one explanation
for this.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.170
Either the house is infested

10:34.170 --> 10:37.620
with large, romantically
inclined termites...

10:39.830 --> 10:42.080
...or I have a secret admirer.

10:43.790 --> 10:44.880
Hoo-hah!

10:44.880 --> 10:49.080
I've always said
I love Valentine's Day!

10:49.080 --> 10:52.750
Now, all I have to do is find
my bashful Lothario

10:52.750 --> 10:57.040
so he can declare
his undying devotion to me!

10:59.460 --> 11:02.330
Memo to myself.
Get it in writing.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.920
Why can't I just give
Nanny the cake and say,

11:10.920 --> 11:12.790
"Happy Valentine's Day"?

11:13.830 --> 11:16.330
Dweeb. Nanny thinks
we're criminals.

11:16.330 --> 11:20.460
We're not criminals.
We're consultants on parole.

11:20.460 --> 11:21.540
Listen, doofus.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.580
You want to get on
Nanny's good side,

11:23.580 --> 11:25.670
you're gonna have to
creep up on her.

11:27.790 --> 11:29.500
Here she comes.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.120
Go for it,
you romantic devil, you!

11:40.620 --> 11:44.000
Whoa! Oh, dear! Oh...

11:47.540 --> 11:49.080
Whoa!

11:50.500 --> 11:52.920
-Horace: Owww!

12:01.710 --> 12:03.620
Think it's time for plan B.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.830
♪ You love me

12:10.830 --> 12:14.210

12:14.210 --> 12:16.710
Oh, I can't wait to
personalize everything

12:16.710 --> 12:19.080
when I find out
who the little monkey is!

12:19.080 --> 12:20.120
Ha ha ha!

12:20.120 --> 12:21.540
And I will find him!

12:21.540 --> 12:23.420
Ha ha ha!
Ooh, yes, I will.

12:27.500 --> 12:31.540
Oh, I tell you, I didn't
give you a Valentine!

12:31.540 --> 12:33.210
Oh, no need to be coy,

12:33.210 --> 12:37.000
you salty, seafaring
hunk of hard tack.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.420
Oh, pl-please!

12:39.420 --> 12:41.830
Avast! Repel
off-board.

12:41.830 --> 12:46.420
You know Starbuck's
only in love with
himself!

12:46.420 --> 12:47.750
What he said.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.580
Good point.

12:51.580 --> 12:53.500
Your loss, sailor.

12:57.500 --> 13:01.120
He can't hide from me forever!

13:19.380 --> 13:20.580
Hello.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.330
Oh!

13:31.750 --> 13:33.420
She's tough.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.210
You're on your own.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.380
This plan really stinks, Lucky!

13:47.330 --> 13:49.670
You got a better idea?

13:49.670 --> 13:52.460
Truthfully,
I thought eight-track tapes

13:52.460 --> 13:54.420
were a better idea.

13:54.420 --> 13:55.960
Yeah, Scorch isn't

13:55.960 --> 13:58.790
just gonna hand
the Valentine over, you know.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.170
Look!

14:07.420 --> 14:09.120
We've found it.

14:11.120 --> 14:14.170
Now, how do we get it?

14:14.170 --> 14:18.420
Ralphie: I'm telling you, Cru,
I don't feel that way about ya.

14:18.420 --> 14:20.330
You're my business rival.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.460
It would be unethical of me
to like you.

14:22.460 --> 14:23.500
Ohhh!

14:23.500 --> 14:26.750
Oh, fess up,
Ralphie, darling!

14:26.750 --> 14:28.380
Who else can it be?

14:28.380 --> 14:32.210
I'm a lot of things, Cru,
but I'm not as dumb as I look.

14:32.210 --> 14:34.420
Oh, you're right.

14:34.420 --> 14:37.040
Anyone who wears
such gauche undergarments

14:37.040 --> 14:40.500
doesn't have the taste to
appreciate a prize like me.

14:51.580 --> 14:53.080
-Go for it.
-Atta-girl, Spot!

14:57.170 --> 15:00.210
Sometimes, it really pays off
to have a pup that can fly.

15:00.210 --> 15:02.500
Cruella: And what have we here?

15:03.580 --> 15:05.120
Yike!

15:06.250 --> 15:09.460
You know I hate spots
in my nice, clean house.

15:09.460 --> 15:12.000
You disgusting vermin
are the perfect ending

15:12.000 --> 15:14.830
to an absolutely
horrendous day!

15:14.830 --> 15:17.830
But I'll feel better
when you're gone.

15:20.460 --> 15:24.120
It's him!
My secret admirer!

15:24.120 --> 15:26.710
He's come at last!

15:30.710 --> 15:33.210
Oh, it's you.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.710
Here, take out the trash.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.380
Actually, I just
came by to see

15:54.380 --> 15:56.250
if you found
my Valentine.

15:58.380 --> 16:01.540
That's your Valentine?

16:01.540 --> 16:02.750
You've got it?

16:02.750 --> 16:05.920
Got it?
Of course I've got it.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.500
And I'll tell you this!

16:08.750 --> 16:11.420
Mmm! I love it.

16:11.420 --> 16:15.170
Oh, Roger, this is such
a happy surprise.

16:17.580 --> 16:18.670
"Roger"!

16:18.670 --> 16:20.210
You remembered
my name!

16:20.210 --> 16:23.170
Oh, of course, Roger.

16:23.170 --> 16:24.830
I'd never forget
the name

16:24.830 --> 16:28.250
of my very own
secret admirer.

16:28.250 --> 16:30.290
Would I, hmm?

16:33.710 --> 16:36.710
Well, don't just stand there
admiring me from afar!

16:36.710 --> 16:38.540
Come in and admire me.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.120
Roger: Whoa!

16:40.120 --> 16:43.040
I can't begin to
tell you, Roger, dear,

16:43.040 --> 16:45.420
what this Valentine
means to me.

16:45.420 --> 16:47.830
To be admired
and esteemed,

16:47.830 --> 16:49.960
even by someone as
innocuous as you,

16:49.960 --> 16:51.960
well, we can
at least be

16:51.960 --> 16:53.290
good friends,
can we not?

16:53.290 --> 16:55.210
Good friends? But--

16:55.210 --> 16:58.420
I especially like the song.

16:58.420 --> 17:01.580
♪ You love me
and I love you ♪

17:01.580 --> 17:05.080
♪ With a heart
so full and true ♪

17:06.830 --> 17:10.210
Oh, Roger,
you've captured me in song.

17:10.210 --> 17:14.210
But I wasn't thinking
about you at all.

17:14.210 --> 17:17.380
♪ Be my Valentine
I plead ♪

17:17.380 --> 17:20.380
♪ Anita, love,
you're what I need ♪

17:20.380 --> 17:21.420
Anita?

17:21.420 --> 17:23.500
You made this
for your wife?

17:23.500 --> 17:26.120
What is the world
coming to?

17:26.120 --> 17:29.120
After all we've
meant to each
other, Rumpus.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.710
B-b-but...
we didn't mean anything.

17:31.710 --> 17:32.830
We could have!

17:32.830 --> 17:34.250
-But--
-Get out!

17:34.250 --> 17:37.210
-But--
-I said get out!

17:37.210 --> 17:38.960
Roger: Whoa! Ooh!

17:48.210 --> 17:49.420
But...

17:49.420 --> 17:51.250
my Valentine!

17:52.880 --> 17:55.170
Memo to myself.

17:55.170 --> 17:59.250
Erase Valentine's Day
from the face of the earth.

18:02.380 --> 18:06.960
If I don't get a Valentine,
nobody gets a Valentine!

18:27.580 --> 18:30.920
Rolly: I don't think this is
gonna replace the Valentine

18:30.920 --> 18:32.500
Roger made for Anita.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.250
Relax! Anita will never
know the difference.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.000
She's just a human.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.620
You guys,
Cruella's stealing

18:39.620 --> 18:42.250
all the hearts
from everywhere
and everyplace.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.330
Poor Cruella.

18:44.330 --> 18:48.040
She needs TLC.
She needs love.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.170
She needs help.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.420
Okay, let me
get this straight.

18:51.420 --> 18:54.580
You want us to help Cruella,
a known puppy hater

18:54.580 --> 18:57.380
who wants to wipe us
off the face of the earth!

18:57.380 --> 19:00.460
Well, it is
Valentine's Day

19:00.460 --> 19:02.460
Cruella:
Hasta la vista!

19:06.460 --> 19:09.120
Well, goodbye, heartbreak!

19:11.250 --> 19:14.330
When you care enough
to shred the very best.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.120
What

19:21.120 --> 19:23.080
Come to gloat, I suppose,

19:23.080 --> 19:27.000
at the only person in the world
who doesn't get any Valentines.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.080
What's this?

19:32.080 --> 19:34.120
A flower

19:37.880 --> 19:40.120
And a gourmet chocolate bar?

19:46.420 --> 19:49.420
A mood ring!
I really need this.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.080
My last one exploded.

19:57.170 --> 19:58.710
Now, don't expect me to fall

19:58.710 --> 20:02.040
for that "dog is man's
best friend" falderal.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.040
I didn't think this
was gonna work.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.210
Just wait a second.

20:09.420 --> 20:12.080
Just so you don't think we're
friends or anything.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.460
Too bad none of you has
a trust fund to share.

20:21.250 --> 20:22.540
Hmm.

20:22.540 --> 20:25.210
Here, get this gaudy piece
of junk out of here

20:25.210 --> 20:27.330
and clutter up your own yard.

20:29.170 --> 20:31.330
Hmm, giving someone
a Valentine,

20:31.330 --> 20:33.170
just to make them happy.

20:33.170 --> 20:35.000
What a concept!

20:37.000 --> 20:41.670
Come along, Scorch'ums,
we have some things to replace.

20:45.290 --> 20:46.750
It's not as nice

20:46.750 --> 20:48.710
as the other one,
but...

20:48.710 --> 20:51.620
Oh, it's the thought
that counts.

20:51.620 --> 20:52.790
Right?

20:52.790 --> 20:54.960
Right! Just don't get
mushy or anything.

20:58.080 --> 21:01.080
Huh? What is that man
up to now?

21:04.170 --> 21:05.670
Don't push, don't push.

21:05.670 --> 21:07.620
There's plenty of cake
to go around.

21:08.580 --> 21:11.710
I just didn't want
my Valentine's Day cake

21:11.710 --> 21:13.500
to go to waste.

21:18.080 --> 21:21.080
♪ You love me
and I love you ♪

21:21.080 --> 21:24.290
♪ With a heart
so full and true ♪

21:25.460 --> 21:28.580
♪ Be my Valentine
I plead ♪

21:28.580 --> 21:31.620
♪ Anita, love,
you're what I need ♪

21:31.620 --> 21:34.330
It's a beautiful
Valentine, Roger.

21:34.330 --> 21:36.670
I just hope Cruella
can get over it.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.120
Oh, she's
a tough old bird.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.120
She doesn't need
anybody.

21:49.670 --> 21:53.330
Happy Valentine's Day,
Scorchy-poo.
