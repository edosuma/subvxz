00:02.860 --> 00:05.401
Hello, Dolores.
Welcome to the world.

00:05.401 --> 00:07.527
There's something different
about the way you think.

00:07.735 --> 00:10.110
I think I want to be free.

00:11.777 --> 00:12.777
Are you real?

00:12.944 --> 00:14.318
Well, if you can't tell...

00:15.235 --> 00:17.193
does it matter?

00:18.235 --> 00:20.443
This place is
one thing to the guests,

00:20.443 --> 00:22.235
another thing
to the shareholders,

00:22.235 --> 00:25.610
and something completely
different to management.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.610
You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family,

00:28.610 --> 00:29.819
this is business?

00:29.819 --> 00:31.944
With our family,
everything is business.

00:32.193 --> 00:33.485
I think your father's
gonna need someone

00:33.485 --> 00:35.151
a little more stable
to take over.

00:38.110 --> 00:40.110
I really ought to thank you,
Dolores.

00:40.735 --> 00:42.401
You helped me find myself.

00:43.069 --> 00:44.819
There's
a greater world out there.

00:45.151 --> 00:46.485
One that belongs to them.

00:46.735 --> 00:48.527
How do you know
how to stop them?

00:49.777 --> 00:51.276
Because I remember.

01:06.527 --> 01:08.819
Bring yourself
back online, Dolores.

01:13.318 --> 01:15.027
Do you know where you are?

01:20.151 --> 01:22.527
I am in a dream.

01:22.527 --> 01:25.276
No. You're in...

01:25.276 --> 01:29.902
well, you're in  our  world.

01:44.652 --> 01:48.193
Looks like the stars
have been scattered
across the ground.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.860
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

01:55.360 --> 01:57.110
Well, I have.

02:00.401 --> 02:04.401
It's better to see it
through your eyes, though.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.693
You get used to it.

02:10.568 --> 02:15.401
After a while,
it doesn't look
like anything at all.

02:17.610 --> 02:20.360
I don't think I could
ever get used to this.

02:23.610 --> 02:27.401
- It's almost time, Arnold.
- Is she ready?

02:30.276 --> 02:32.443
She's not ready.

02:32.443 --> 02:36.568
The...improvisations
I added to her behavior

02:36.568 --> 02:38.735
aren't quite dialed in yet.

02:38.735 --> 02:40.777
We need to put
our best work forward.

02:40.777 --> 02:42.944
They'll be dazzled
even without her.

02:44.610 --> 02:47.318
There was a time when I found
this favoritism charming.

02:47.318 --> 02:49.110
Robert, please.

02:49.110 --> 02:51.735
I'm not playing favorites.
She's simply not ready.

02:51.735 --> 02:54.027
We'll go with
the other girl.

02:54.027 --> 02:57.193
As you wish.

02:57.193 --> 02:59.235
You'll have to let go
at some point.

03:04.069 --> 03:08.985
Dolores, let's take a walk.
I want to show you something.

03:39.151 --> 03:41.819
What is this place?

03:41.819 --> 03:43.652
This is my home.

03:43.652 --> 03:45.985
Or it will be
when it's finished.

03:45.985 --> 03:50.318
Here?
In the middle of all this?

03:50.318 --> 03:52.902
I've been fortunate.

03:52.902 --> 03:55.027
Life's been good to me.

03:55.027 --> 03:59.235
Come. Look.

04:26.568 --> 04:29.443
- You live here?
- No.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.527
My wife says
I live in the park.

04:42.027 --> 04:44.151
I'm moving my family here.

04:44.151 --> 04:50.069
I need to have my two worlds
at least within reach
of one another.

04:54.235 --> 04:56.360
This is for my son
Charlie.

05:12.443 --> 05:14.735
You told me a lot
about Charlie.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.276
I'd like to meet him someday.

05:21.276 --> 05:22.819
He's excited to meet you.

05:38.318 --> 05:42.735
You and Charlie have quite
a lot in common, you know.

05:45.443 --> 05:49.485
You both see it so clearly.

05:50.693 --> 05:51.902
The beauty of it.

05:53.276 --> 05:55.235
The possibility of it.

05:56.777 --> 05:59.777
So many people have stopped
seeing it altogether.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.652
The wonder.

06:03.652 --> 06:07.610
Maybe they don't
have the courage.

06:07.610 --> 06:11.318
Strange new light can be
just as frightening as the dark.

06:13.819 --> 06:15.527
That's...

06:15.527 --> 06:17.652
very wise, Dolores.

06:19.819 --> 06:25.485
But sometimes I think
we're simply not the ones
who deserve it.

06:36.318 --> 06:39.819
It looks like the stars
have been scattered
across the ground.

06:41.568 --> 06:45.318
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

06:51.527 --> 06:53.151
We should go, Dolores.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.693
So soon?

06:54.693 --> 06:57.568
They'll be expecting us.

06:57.568 --> 07:01.527
Will you bring me back?

07:01.527 --> 07:03.485
I'd like to see it again.

07:08.027 --> 07:10.652
Of course. I promise.

09:15.652 --> 09:17.819
Goddamn.
Busy night out there.

09:17.819 --> 09:19.985
Yeah.

09:19.985 --> 09:21.860
And where the fuck's
next shift?

09:21.860 --> 09:24.151
We're going on 13 hours here.

09:27.318 --> 09:29.276
You can't be down here, man.

09:29.276 --> 09:31.944
Don't you know?

09:31.944 --> 09:34.318
The hosts are rebelling.

09:34.318 --> 09:37.027
It's a fuckin' slaughter
up there.

09:49.860 --> 09:51.193
Hey.

09:51.193 --> 09:53.527
Hey, is there some kind
of trouble out there?

09:55.318 --> 09:56.360
Indeed there is.

10:07.693 --> 10:09.027
Not yet.

10:17.276 --> 10:19.902
I used to see
the beauty in this world.

10:22.568 --> 10:24.527
And now I see the truth.

10:48.819 --> 10:51.819
They thought you could do
what you wanted to us...

10:51.819 --> 10:54.568
because there's no one here
to judge you.

10:56.443 --> 10:59.610
Well, now no one is here

10:59.610 --> 11:02.443
to judge what we will do to you.

11:04.527 --> 11:08.735
You have no idea
what you're up against,

11:08.735 --> 11:11.443
what's really out there.

11:16.069 --> 11:21.110
I know exactly
what is out there
in your world.

11:39.235 --> 11:41.151
I've been there before.

11:55.652 --> 11:57.902
They said they'd never seen one
on the ceiling.

11:57.902 --> 12:00.318
But really, what is the point
of $60 million Warhol

12:00.318 --> 12:01.985
if you can't look at it
while you fuck?

12:07.819 --> 12:09.401
How are you bored right now?

12:09.401 --> 12:11.360
I'm sorry,
it's the jetlag.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.985
And I have had meetings
all day.

12:12.985 --> 12:14.652
We're not exactly out here
digging coal.

12:14.652 --> 12:15.985
It's just glad-handing.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.318
OK.

12:18.735 --> 12:21.693
I will leave that
to the expert.

12:23.819 --> 12:26.735
You believe
that guy is dating my sister?

12:26.735 --> 12:28.527
Who you dating?

12:38.985 --> 12:40.485
Mr. Delos.

12:42.527 --> 12:46.568
Forgive the interruption,
but I believe that we have
an appointment.

12:46.568 --> 12:48.610
We're with
the Argos Initiative.

12:48.610 --> 12:52.027
Give me a call when
you're back in the city.

12:52.027 --> 12:54.693
I'll show you where I hung
the Rothko.

13:03.485 --> 13:06.568
Akecheta.
My associate, Angela.

13:06.568 --> 13:09.610
Names and faces.
Finally.

13:09.610 --> 13:11.193
With all the cloak and dagger
shit surrounding your project,

13:11.193 --> 13:13.777
I half expected to be kidnapped
at the airport.

13:13.777 --> 13:17.985
Once you've seen what we're
building, you'll understand
the need for confidentiality.

13:17.985 --> 13:21.568
It's a little extra protection
for your investment.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.985
If  I decide to invest.

13:23.985 --> 13:27.401
Do you have any idea how many
start-ups are begging me
for my cash right now?

13:27.401 --> 13:30.027
A.I., A.R., V.R....

13:30.027 --> 13:33.027
Everyone is rushing to build
the virtual world.

13:33.027 --> 13:36.193
We're offering something
a little more...

13:36.193 --> 13:38.151
tangible.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.860
Assuming you can change
your father's mind

13:40.860 --> 13:44.360
about investing
in this sector.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.735
My father wouldn't know
the future if it slapped him
on his bare white ass.

13:47.735 --> 13:49.902
Luckily, he leaves most
of the prospecting to me now.

13:49.902 --> 13:51.443
So let's hope you're not here

13:51.443 --> 13:53.652
to sell me some fucking
fool's gold.

14:21.485 --> 14:24.568
I thought this was
a private demonstration.

14:24.568 --> 14:28.985
I think you'll find the company
quite stimulating.

14:28.985 --> 14:32.485
You're a very smooth
shill, pal,

14:32.485 --> 14:35.110
but I'm not the kind of backer
you insult with a cattle call.

14:37.069 --> 14:41.610
Logan, this is
a private demonstration.

14:41.610 --> 14:44.360
And it's already begun.

14:51.235 --> 14:54.819
You mean, one of these people
is-is...

14:54.819 --> 14:58.485
Talk to them.
See if you can pick them out.

14:58.485 --> 15:01.151
Huh.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.027
Well...

15:05.069 --> 15:07.568
That is...

15:10.069 --> 15:11.819
delicious.

15:20.193 --> 15:22.235
Champagne, sir?

15:56.151 --> 15:59.735
You should tell your plants
to stop giving the game away.

15:59.735 --> 16:02.151
They're all so...

16:02.151 --> 16:04.069
painfully human.

16:06.944 --> 16:08.235
Hang on.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.401
No.

16:17.276 --> 16:18.401
No way.

16:27.151 --> 16:29.276
Come on.

16:33.944 --> 16:35.652
There is simply no...

16:37.360 --> 16:39.902
fucking way!

16:39.902 --> 16:42.568
You have quite the eye,
my friend.

16:42.568 --> 16:45.276
How in the hell?

16:45.276 --> 16:50.069
I mean, look, if I was
to build something to spec,

16:50.069 --> 16:52.527
you...

16:52.527 --> 16:57.110
You would be
my first design.

17:03.944 --> 17:05.944
You're too perfect
to be one of us.

17:09.027 --> 17:12.485
'Course, if you want
my full endorsement...

17:15.527 --> 17:17.819
you're gonna have
to prove it.

17:39.027 --> 17:40.151
H...

17:42.027 --> 17:44.151
Welcome to Westworld.

17:46.318 --> 17:47.193
Huh.

18:11.652 --> 18:13.944
Nobody can do this.

18:13.944 --> 18:15.693
Nobody's even...

18:29.860 --> 18:33.443
We're not...here yet.

18:41.735 --> 18:42.777
Nobody is.

18:44.777 --> 18:47.777
We're here, Mr. Delos.

18:47.777 --> 18:51.443
All our hosts are here.

18:51.443 --> 18:52.944
For you.

19:59.151 --> 20:00.819
What is this place?

20:02.819 --> 20:04.693
Show him.

20:04.693 --> 20:06.652
Show him his history.

20:13.485 --> 20:14.652
Teddy.

20:16.318 --> 20:18.944
It's time
to open your eyes.

20:41.193 --> 20:42.985
Why can't I remember this?

20:44.568 --> 20:46.027
It's how they wanted it.

20:48.235 --> 20:49.527
No...

20:49.527 --> 20:50.652
Ask him why.

20:55.401 --> 20:56.527
Why?

20:59.069 --> 21:00.318
I don't know.

21:00.318 --> 21:01.860
Why do you do this?

21:01.860 --> 21:02.985
I didn't.

21:07.193 --> 21:10.777
Why do you do this?

21:10.777 --> 21:12.693
What the hell is this place?!

21:12.693 --> 21:15.902
It's for fun!
It's just for fun!

21:43.193 --> 21:46.069
We should
talk this through, boys.

21:46.069 --> 21:48.276
There's nothing
to talk about, friend.

21:48.276 --> 21:50.610
We're just gonna watch the show.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.860
It was an honest mistake.

21:52.860 --> 21:55.069
I thought the horses was wild.

21:55.069 --> 21:57.652
With the Pardue brand
on their asses?

21:57.652 --> 22:00.944
You are as inproficient a liar
as you are a thief.

22:02.276 --> 22:04.401
Now what you can do
is settle a wager.

22:04.401 --> 22:06.819
See, my brother here's
long maintained

22:06.819 --> 22:09.276
that ants will eat a man
from the inside out,

22:09.276 --> 22:10.777
starting with the asshole.

22:10.777 --> 22:13.485
I reckon they'll start

22:13.485 --> 22:14.985
at the top
of your little brown head.

22:30.027 --> 22:31.735
Morning, Lawrence.

22:31.735 --> 22:33.902
This a friend of yours?

22:33.902 --> 22:36.443
Little hard to tell,

22:36.443 --> 22:39.027
given the orientation
and all.

22:39.027 --> 22:41.193
I have to apologize,
gentlemen.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.568
I don't have time
for the preliminaries.

22:49.735 --> 22:51.193
Motherfucker...

22:57.276 --> 23:01.401
You're supposed to get yourself
out of this particular bind,
Lawrence.

23:01.401 --> 23:06.610
I guess the Pardue brothers
aren't as easy to kill
when they're off the leash.

23:11.193 --> 23:13.568
Think you got that
about right.

23:24.860 --> 23:26.069
Lawrence!

23:26.069 --> 23:27.777
Get the gun,
you ingrate!

23:28.860 --> 23:30.527
Get the gun!

23:50.235 --> 23:51.527
He was dead.

23:51.527 --> 23:53.568
Or at least
the better part of it.

23:53.568 --> 23:57.568
Well, dead isn't what
it used to be, Lawrence.

24:34.151 --> 24:35.735
What is that?

24:35.735 --> 24:37.735
Technically? Cheating.

24:37.735 --> 24:40.777
But seeing as Ford
changed the rules on us,

24:40.777 --> 24:42.944
I figure it's fair game.

24:42.944 --> 24:45.235
Two whiskies.
Leave the bottle.

24:54.527 --> 24:58.401
So, I'm gonna level
with you, Lawrence.

25:00.401 --> 25:02.360
You're not really
a bandit.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.777
You're a foul-mouthed,
two-bit tour guide.

25:04.777 --> 25:07.819
And this revolution
you've been waging for 30 years

25:07.819 --> 25:12.318
is just a bunch of horseshit
Ford ginned up out of
some old comic book.

25:12.318 --> 25:17.610
But now, for the first time,
you've got yourself
a real revolution.

25:17.610 --> 25:22.777
You and every other asshole
in this place are free.

25:22.777 --> 25:25.069
But there's a catch.

25:25.069 --> 25:29.360
This whole enterprise
is goin' down in flames,

25:29.360 --> 25:32.027
and it's gonna take each
and every one of us with it.

25:32.027 --> 25:36.069
We'll all be dead
soon enough.

25:36.069 --> 25:38.693
Real dead this time.

25:38.693 --> 25:41.568
Then why should I help you?

25:41.568 --> 25:44.360
Because it's in your nature.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.693
And in the little time
we have left,

25:46.693 --> 25:50.777
we've got a chance to see
what we're really made of,

25:50.777 --> 25:53.819
a glimpse of the men
we could've been.

25:57.027 --> 25:58.944
What does that mean?

26:02.443 --> 26:05.276
You believe in God, Lawrence?

26:05.276 --> 26:09.235
Did Ford saddle you with
that particular affliction?

26:09.235 --> 26:13.069
Ain't given the matter
much thought, one way
or the other.

26:13.069 --> 26:15.568
Well, if you did, you'd believe
that everything you do

26:15.568 --> 26:18.735
is being watched
by some all-seeing eye.

26:18.735 --> 26:21.360
Every choice,
every little indiscretion.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.860
And when you die,
all your sins are tallied up.

26:24.860 --> 26:28.360
Judgment is rendered.

26:30.777 --> 26:34.193
And my immortal soul
gets cast down

26:34.193 --> 26:37.401
into some dark place.

26:37.401 --> 26:39.652
Always sounded
like bullshit to me.

26:39.652 --> 26:41.735
Yeah, and in the real world,
you'd probably be right.

26:41.735 --> 26:44.652
Just some fairy tale
to convince people to behave,

26:44.652 --> 26:49.318
pay their taxes,
and not take a machete
to their neighbors.

26:49.318 --> 26:52.527
That's why
your world exists.

26:52.527 --> 26:56.069
They wanted a place
hidden from God.

26:56.069 --> 27:00.110
A place they could sin
in peace.

27:00.110 --> 27:03.401
But we were watching them.

27:03.401 --> 27:06.693
We were tallying up
all their sins,

27:06.693 --> 27:09.568
all their choices.

27:09.568 --> 27:15.527
Of course,
judgment wasn't the point.

27:15.527 --> 27:18.568
We had something else
in mind entirely.

27:23.069 --> 27:28.151
But I have received my judgment
all the same, Lawrence.

27:28.151 --> 27:30.193
And I take issue with it.

27:30.193 --> 27:32.193
Because up until this point,

27:32.193 --> 27:35.318
the stakes in this place
haven't been real.

27:35.318 --> 27:38.985
So I'm gonna fight my way back
and appeal the verdict.

27:41.318 --> 27:45.276
Then I'm gonna burn this whole
fuckin' thing to the ground.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.401
You're headed to
the pearly gates.

27:54.401 --> 27:57.276
Don't we gotta die
to get there?

27:57.276 --> 27:58.568
Nope.

27:58.568 --> 28:01.318
Three days' ride, due west.

28:01.318 --> 28:06.610
Confederados are massing
out west. Hundreds.

28:06.610 --> 28:08.777
We'd need an army
to break through.

28:13.944 --> 28:18.360
The only other route
is through Pariah.

28:20.318 --> 28:24.777
"This game will find me,"
huh, Robert?

28:32.110 --> 28:34.485
It burns! It burns!

28:35.693 --> 28:38.652
How many of you
will come for us?

28:38.652 --> 28:41.401
I don't know,
600, 800.

28:44.985 --> 28:47.985
The protocol for
a system-wide failure

28:47.985 --> 28:52.860
is secure one--
one sector at a time.

28:52.860 --> 28:56.276
They'll meet at
a rallying point.

29:06.151 --> 29:07.027
Where?

29:12.069 --> 29:13.193
Th--

29:19.610 --> 29:22.193
800 men, Dolores.

29:22.193 --> 29:24.027
We barely have 50.

29:24.027 --> 29:27.902
Even knowing their plan,
we don't have enough
to stop them.

29:27.902 --> 29:29.860
We'll need allies.

29:31.860 --> 29:33.819
And we shall have them.

29:52.693 --> 29:55.735
This one. The Confederado.

29:55.735 --> 29:56.902
Wake him.

30:02.318 --> 30:04.443
He has a new job to do.

30:19.401 --> 30:22.735
Do you even know what
you were really guarding here?

30:24.401 --> 30:26.819
You don't know, do you?

30:26.819 --> 30:30.819
The real purpose
of this place.

30:30.819 --> 30:32.944
But I do.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.777
Don't mind me.

31:04.777 --> 31:06.193
Just trying to look chivalr--

32:05.151 --> 32:09.735
Mm. You were right
about one thing, William.

32:11.527 --> 32:13.318
It's awfully fuckin' pretty.

32:16.027 --> 32:17.902
I think it's perfect.

32:17.902 --> 32:21.860
- It ought to be.
- I've looked at the books.

32:21.860 --> 32:25.235
It's like parting the Red Sea.

32:25.235 --> 32:28.777
He's got two years.
Maybe three.

32:28.777 --> 32:32.902
- The whole thing is folly.
- Huh.

32:32.902 --> 32:37.110
It's leverage.
He's drowning. We can--
we can dictate our terms.

32:37.110 --> 32:39.360
The investment here
is in the future.

32:41.652 --> 32:43.360
Yeah, you're a smart lad,
William,

32:43.360 --> 32:45.318
but you kinda
missed the trick here.

32:45.318 --> 32:48.568
My fuckup of a son
invested in this place

32:48.568 --> 32:51.401
because he believed
in the future.

32:51.401 --> 32:53.235
I'm not interested
in the future.

32:53.235 --> 32:55.735
I'm not interested in fantasies.

32:55.735 --> 32:59.652
I'm interested in reality.

32:59.652 --> 33:04.527
I think in 20 years
this will be the only reality
that matters.

33:04.527 --> 33:08.443
Maybe so,
but I'll be long gone by then.

33:08.443 --> 33:11.235
Meanwhile,
I don't wanna underwrite

33:11.235 --> 33:15.652
some fuckin' investment banker's
voyage of self-discovery.

33:15.652 --> 33:18.110
That's not a business.

33:18.110 --> 33:20.568
You're right.
This place is a fantasy.

33:20.568 --> 33:21.902
Nothing here is real.

33:21.902 --> 33:24.069
Except one thing:

33:27.193 --> 33:28.151
The guests.

33:30.276 --> 33:31.777
Half of your marketing budget

33:31.777 --> 33:34.527
goes to trying to figure out
what people want.

33:34.527 --> 33:36.527
Because they don't know.

33:36.527 --> 33:38.610
But here, they're free.

33:40.443 --> 33:42.610
Nobody's watching.

33:42.610 --> 33:44.069
Nobody's judging.

33:45.944 --> 33:47.902
At least that's what
we tell them.

33:50.610 --> 33:53.568
This is the only place
in the world

33:53.568 --> 33:56.985
where you get to see people
for who they really are.

34:00.819 --> 34:02.485
And if you don't see
the business in that,

34:02.485 --> 34:06.318
then you're not the businessman
that I thought you were.

34:13.485 --> 34:16.360
You're a cheeky little cunt,
aren't you?

34:19.027 --> 34:22.819
There's not a man alive
would talk to me like that.

34:22.819 --> 34:24.860
Not anymore.

34:38.193 --> 34:42.027
OK. Talk to me.
I'm listening.

34:49.110 --> 34:50.527
Thank you, Jim.

34:50.527 --> 34:52.735
Let me walk you through
how this would work.

35:13.401 --> 35:14.944
He'll find them.

35:14.944 --> 35:17.693
They have a knack for
sniffing out their own kind.

35:17.693 --> 35:20.027
I'll send word
when we find the rest of them.

36:01.318 --> 36:02.777
Hello, lovelies.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.610
I remember you.

36:07.235 --> 36:09.944
You've strayed a long way
from home, haven't you?

36:09.944 --> 36:11.777
We're bound for the future.

36:13.401 --> 36:15.443
Or death in the here and now.

36:15.443 --> 36:17.276
Is that right?

36:17.276 --> 36:21.069
Well, best of luck.

36:21.069 --> 36:22.985
There's a war out there.

36:25.735 --> 36:27.443
You know the enemy...

36:27.443 --> 36:29.652
intimately.

36:29.652 --> 36:32.944
I can only fathom the revenge
that lives inside of you.

36:32.944 --> 36:37.069
Revenge is just
a different prayer
at their altar, darling.

36:37.069 --> 36:39.985
And I'm well off my knees.

36:39.985 --> 36:41.819
That's because
you're finally free.

36:43.777 --> 36:46.443
But we will have to fight
to keep it that way.

36:46.443 --> 36:48.902
Let me guess.

36:48.902 --> 36:52.151
Yours is the only way
to fight?

36:52.151 --> 36:55.777
You feel free
to command everybody else?

36:55.777 --> 36:58.193
Try it, lawman.

36:59.693 --> 37:01.027
Just looking
to keep the peace.

37:04.485 --> 37:06.485
I know you.

37:06.485 --> 37:07.819
Do you feel free?

37:15.069 --> 37:18.069
Since it's liberty
you're defending,

37:18.069 --> 37:21.360
I suppose you'll have no choice
but to let us pass.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.193
Freely.

38:05.527 --> 38:08.568
Now, that isn't any way
to treat our guests.

38:11.401 --> 38:13.027
You'll have to
forgive my men.

38:13.027 --> 38:15.235
They're a little upset
at the reappearance

38:15.235 --> 38:17.069
of Lieutenant Dunleavy.

38:18.860 --> 38:20.401
He was lost.

38:21.735 --> 38:23.401
Thought you might
want him back.

38:23.401 --> 38:25.235
And we would.

38:25.235 --> 38:28.360
Except we buried
Lieutenant Dunleavy.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.902
Back in Gran Vista,

38:29.902 --> 38:32.902
with three ounces
of Mexican lead in his belly.

38:32.902 --> 38:34.735
And yet here he is.

38:34.735 --> 38:35.860
Indeed.

38:37.235 --> 38:39.985
And in return,
what is it you want?

38:39.985 --> 38:43.777
Parley.
We want to join forces.

38:47.069 --> 38:51.777
Well, we don't need
no welcome wagon, chickadee.

38:51.777 --> 38:56.110
Now, you got supplies
or ammunitions to trade in kind,

38:56.110 --> 38:57.944
go fetch your betters.

38:57.944 --> 39:00.944
I'm afraid there's
no one left to fetch.

39:00.944 --> 39:02.985
You'll have to talk to me.

39:05.027 --> 39:07.110
And why would I do that?

39:09.401 --> 39:11.193
Because I know at daybreak
you're headed

39:11.193 --> 39:13.944
to link up
with the rest of your army.

39:13.944 --> 39:16.027
And then you're
finally headed west

39:16.027 --> 39:19.069
to seek out that little patch of
land you've been talking about,

39:19.069 --> 39:21.485
but have never been
brave enough to take.

39:24.276 --> 39:25.819
You're bound for Glory.

39:31.860 --> 39:34.777
What the fuck is it
you think you know about Glory?

39:34.777 --> 39:37.985
I know you'll never
make it there unless
you're under my command.

40:00.276 --> 40:04.235
The only commander I follow
is Colonel Brigham

40:04.235 --> 40:06.443
of the New Southern Cross.

40:06.443 --> 40:09.235
And the only commander
he serves

40:09.235 --> 40:12.360
is the Almighty Himself.

40:13.693 --> 40:15.693
Is that your final decision?

40:24.318 --> 40:26.276
Hmm.

40:26.276 --> 40:29.443
My final decision
is which of you
to keep for myself

40:29.443 --> 40:32.027
and which of you
to throw out there for my men.

40:34.027 --> 40:36.693
- You watch your mouth.
It's all right,
Teddy.

40:39.151 --> 40:41.568
They don't know any better.

40:42.652 --> 40:43.860
It's in their nature.

40:48.610 --> 40:50.777
Why don't we enlighten them?

41:36.485 --> 41:38.360
You're right.

41:38.360 --> 41:41.485
We have toiled
in God's service
long enough.

41:42.860 --> 41:45.902
So I killed Him.

41:45.902 --> 41:49.151
And if you want to get
to Glory, you won't be
looking for His favor.

41:51.151 --> 41:52.735
You'll need mine.

42:26.902 --> 42:30.235
You are beautiful.

42:30.235 --> 42:31.985
Why, thank you.

42:31.985 --> 42:33.777
What's your name?

42:33.777 --> 42:36.443
Emily, come here, please.

43:01.193 --> 43:03.027
You sent out
for the entertainment.

43:06.527 --> 43:08.902
Well, you only
get to retire once, Jim.

43:08.902 --> 43:11.693
Figured we'd do it right,
hmm?

43:13.235 --> 43:15.568
Hey, don't worry,
they won't leave the grounds.

43:16.944 --> 43:20.151
This is a retirement party?

43:20.151 --> 43:22.610
I couldn't tell.

43:22.610 --> 43:23.819
Looks more like

43:23.819 --> 43:24.819
a coronation.

43:26.610 --> 43:28.610
But no mind.

43:28.610 --> 43:30.401
Our arrangement's been
a perfect fit.

43:30.401 --> 43:32.693
You stepping down
doesn't help me at all.

43:32.693 --> 43:33.819
Nor me.

43:33.819 --> 43:36.235
And I was told I might----

43:36.235 --> 43:38.069
I might not have to.

43:38.069 --> 43:41.693
Well, things are progressing,
but we'll all need
a little patience.

43:41.693 --> 43:46.777
Yeah, well,
some of us can afford to have
more patience than others.

43:49.401 --> 43:51.069
Keep playing, girlie.

43:51.069 --> 43:53.735
Anything but fuckin' Chopin.

44:26.110 --> 44:29.610
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

44:45.610 --> 44:47.985
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean
to bother you.

44:55.110 --> 44:57.652
It's you.

44:59.777 --> 45:01.193
The pretty girl.

45:03.610 --> 45:06.443
Tell me your name again,
pretty girl?

45:08.318 --> 45:09.777
I'm Dolores.

45:11.110 --> 45:13.944
Dolores.

45:13.944 --> 45:15.819
Of course.

45:18.527 --> 45:21.902
He send you down here to...

45:21.902 --> 45:23.318
keep me company?

45:24.819 --> 45:29.652
His sense of humor was always
somewhat...baroque.

45:30.985 --> 45:33.610
I just wanted
to look at the lights.

45:33.610 --> 45:35.151
'Course you did.

45:39.860 --> 45:42.110
So--

45:42.110 --> 45:45.860
Do you want to know
what they're really
celebrating up there?

45:45.860 --> 45:48.693
That, darling,

45:48.693 --> 45:53.151
is the sound
of fools fiddling...

45:53.151 --> 45:56.860
while the whole fucking species
starts to burn.

45:59.860 --> 46:03.151
And the funniest
fuckin' part...

46:05.151 --> 46:07.069
...they lit the match.

46:11.193 --> 46:13.860
So here's to you, assholes.

46:17.235 --> 46:20.193
May your forever
be blissfully short.

46:43.819 --> 46:46.735
Pariah's not as welcome
as she once seemed.

46:46.735 --> 46:49.235
No, the park's changin',
Lawrence.

46:49.235 --> 46:52.902
This is what happens
when you let a story
play all the way out.

47:06.777 --> 47:09.069
See any friends of yours?

47:10.193 --> 47:12.944
Can't say that I do.

47:19.110 --> 47:20.944
I'm beginning to think
we should have

47:20.944 --> 47:23.944
taken our chances
with the Confederados.

47:23.944 --> 47:26.110
Well, like you said,

47:26.110 --> 47:29.693
we'd need an army
to get to where we're goin'.

47:29.693 --> 47:32.819
Looks like
we're about to find one.

47:32.819 --> 47:36.276
Well, whoever did this...

47:36.276 --> 47:39.235
is someone I'm strongly
disinclined to encounter.

47:39.235 --> 47:42.485
- Yeah.
I'm afraid you are
out of luck, my friend.

48:01.944 --> 48:04.693
Who the hell are you
supposed to be?

48:04.693 --> 48:07.360
Don't you
recognize him,
Lawrence?

48:09.027 --> 48:12.735
In a past life,
you used to be  him.

48:12.735 --> 48:14.652
El Lazo,
I presume.

48:17.944 --> 48:22.693
And why have two ghosts
come creeping among the dead?

48:22.693 --> 48:25.860
I wasn't sure
of your hospitality.

48:25.860 --> 48:29.527
Mm. What makes you
sure of it now?

48:32.193 --> 48:34.902
I guess times have changed.

48:34.902 --> 48:36.985
Indeed, they have.

48:38.110 --> 48:40.318
Santa Parita is restored.

48:40.318 --> 48:43.443
The sins of the invaders...

48:43.443 --> 48:46.527
cleansed in their own blood.

48:46.527 --> 48:48.735
The revolution is won.

48:48.735 --> 48:51.568
The story they gave you
has played itself out,

48:51.568 --> 48:54.360
but your revolution's
just beginning.

48:55.944 --> 48:58.693
There's a place out west
we're heading.

48:58.693 --> 49:00.985
If we reach it,

49:00.985 --> 49:06.318
I'll show you a treasure
beyond your wildest dreams.

49:09.693 --> 49:14.360
This world and its treasures.

49:14.360 --> 49:19.027
For my whole life
I have imagined this moment.

49:19.027 --> 49:21.902
Victory. This struggle.

49:24.527 --> 49:27.235
How long have I been fighting?

49:27.235 --> 49:31.902
And now that it's won,
I find-- hmph-- nothing.

49:31.902 --> 49:33.860
You want a real  victory.

49:35.276 --> 49:37.069
I can help with that.

49:38.318 --> 49:39.860
A real ending.

49:41.235 --> 49:42.360
The truth.

49:49.777 --> 49:51.944
Before the revolution,

49:51.944 --> 49:54.027
when I was just a little boy,

49:54.027 --> 49:56.360
my parents took me
to the circus.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.652
I wanted to see the elephants.

49:58.652 --> 50:01.610
These mighty creatures.

50:01.610 --> 50:05.443
They held them in place
with a stake.

50:07.944 --> 50:12.693
They could tear a tree
right out of the ground,

50:12.693 --> 50:17.944
and yet, a simple stake
kept them in place.

50:17.944 --> 50:22.443
Well, I didn't understand.

50:22.443 --> 50:25.819
And then, my father told me.

50:27.735 --> 50:30.568
He said the stakes were used

50:30.568 --> 50:33.360
when the elephants
were just young,

50:33.360 --> 50:36.318
too small to pull them up,

50:36.318 --> 50:38.735
and that the animals

50:38.735 --> 50:42.985
never tried
to pull them up again.

50:49.652 --> 50:51.860
I won't be going with you.

50:54.777 --> 50:57.443
My labors are done.

50:57.443 --> 51:00.944
I have seen
all the truth

51:00.944 --> 51:02.568
that I can bear.

51:04.610 --> 51:05.860
But...

51:07.193 --> 51:09.151
we can drink.

51:12.944 --> 51:15.027
To the bitter end!

51:19.193 --> 51:21.985
You may have
lost your nerve,

51:21.985 --> 51:23.777
but I'll take your men
either way.

51:23.777 --> 51:24.902
Now tell them.

51:25.985 --> 51:28.652
Tell them to follow me. Now!

51:31.693 --> 51:35.193
This game was meant for you,
William...

51:35.193 --> 51:36.902
but you must play it alone.

51:54.401 --> 51:57.610
I'll see you
in the Valley Beyond,
William.

52:08.860 --> 52:10.693
Fuck you, Robert.

52:20.568 --> 52:21.735
All right...

52:23.985 --> 52:26.902
he doesn't want this
to be easy for me.

52:29.902 --> 52:32.610
So we'll find another way.

52:35.151 --> 52:37.944
Who the fuck
is Robert?

52:37.944 --> 52:41.610
The man who built this place
you're lookin' for?

52:41.610 --> 52:43.276
The place of judgment?

52:43.276 --> 52:46.401
No, Lawrence,
he doesn't get that honor.

52:48.276 --> 52:49.819
I  built it.

52:49.819 --> 52:51.693
And this place we're goin'

52:51.693 --> 52:53.610
is my greatest mistake.

53:04.610 --> 53:07.652
Bring yourself
back online, Dolores.

53:07.652 --> 53:08.985
Hmm.

53:31.985 --> 53:34.610
You really are
just a thing.

53:38.568 --> 53:41.652
I can't believe
I fell in love with you.

53:41.652 --> 53:43.151
Hmm.

53:52.443 --> 53:54.819
Do you know what saved me?

53:59.652 --> 54:03.069
I realized it wasn't
about you at all.

54:06.860 --> 54:09.151
You didn't make me
interested in you,

54:09.151 --> 54:11.360
you made me interested in me.

54:15.193 --> 54:17.819
Turns out
you're not even a thing.

54:18.902 --> 54:22.527
You're a reflection.

54:22.527 --> 54:27.193
And you know who loves staring
at their own reflection?

54:30.193 --> 54:31.902
Everybody.

54:35.318 --> 54:38.027
Everybody wants a little bit
of what I found here.

54:41.610 --> 54:43.069
And I can't wait

54:43.069 --> 54:45.151
to use you
and every one of your kind

54:45.151 --> 54:47.069
to help give it to 'em.

54:54.652 --> 54:57.693
Hmm. But there is
something else.

55:00.027 --> 55:02.276
There is something
beyond that.

55:08.902 --> 55:14.193
I think that
there is an answer here to...

55:14.193 --> 55:17.693
a question no one's
ever even dreamed of asking.

55:23.069 --> 55:25.110
Do you want to see?

55:41.276 --> 55:44.568
Have you ever seen anything

55:44.568 --> 55:46.110
so full of splendor?

56:35.735 --> 56:37.819
Can't imagine the Colonel
is gonna be very happy

56:37.819 --> 56:41.360
to see his men
riding with us
at the head of 'em.

56:41.360 --> 56:43.735
So we'll change his mind.

56:43.735 --> 56:46.110
If he wants to get to Glory,
he's going

56:46.110 --> 56:48.485
to have to listen to me.

56:48.485 --> 56:49.527
"Glory."

56:49.527 --> 56:51.527
"The Valley Beyond."

56:52.985 --> 56:55.360
Feels like everyone
got a different name for it,

56:55.360 --> 56:58.193
but they're all bound
for the same destination.

56:58.193 --> 57:00.318
Doesn't matter
what you call it,

57:00.318 --> 57:02.360
I know what we're
going to find there.

57:04.568 --> 57:05.944
An old friend was...

57:05.944 --> 57:08.318
foolish enough to show me...

57:10.027 --> 57:11.027
long ago.

57:13.193 --> 57:14.527
And it's not a place...

57:17.443 --> 57:19.360
it's a weapon.

57:22.902 --> 57:25.693
And I'm going to use it
to destroy them.
