WEBVTT

00:32.767 --> 00:33.934
>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.000 --> 00:34.967
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:35.033 --> 00:36.467
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANK YOU SO

00:36.533 --> 00:40.367
MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:40.433 --> 00:43.233
WE ARE BACK, WE'RE BACK.

00:43.300 --> 00:46.000
THERE IS NO TIME,

00:46.066 --> 00:46.567
THERE'S NO TIME TO GET INTO

00:46.633 --> 00:47.900
EVERYTHING WE MISSED OVER THE

00:47.967 --> 00:48.500
LAST THREE MONTHS, SUFFICE TO

00:48.567 --> 00:49.600
SAY, EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN

00:49.667 --> 00:50.333
AMERICA IS NOW RUNNING FOR

00:50.400 --> 00:51.967
PRESIDENT, JEFF BEZOS TOLD US

00:52.033 --> 00:53.367
ALL TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR HIS

00:53.433 --> 00:53.934
DICK PIC, AND OF COURSE, THE

00:54.000 --> 00:58.767
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY BUSY.

00:58.834 --> 01:00.000
HE FAMOUSLY POSED WITH A FEAST

01:00.066 --> 01:00.967
OF 300 HAMBURGERS -- OR AS HE

01:01.033 --> 01:02.934
PUT IT, "OVER 1,000 HAMBERDERS."

01:03.000 --> 01:04.100
AND ON CHRISTMAS EVE, HE SPOKE

01:04.166 --> 01:05.633
TO A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD AND SAID

01:05.700 --> 01:07.166
THIS.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.633
>> ARE YOU STILL A BELIEVER IN

01:10.700 --> 01:11.900
SANTA?

01:11.967 --> 01:13.133
'CAUSE AT SEVEN, IT'S MARGINAL,

01:13.200 --> 01:14.300
RIGHT?

01:15.500 --> 01:16.367
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S THE

01:16.433 --> 01:17.734
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

01:17.800 --> 01:19.533
RUINING SANTA FOR A CHILD ON

01:19.600 --> 01:21.667
DECEMBER 24TH, WHICH IS ACTUALLY

01:21.734 --> 01:27.300
PERFECTLY ON-BRAND.

01:27.367 --> 01:28.767
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING

01:28.834 --> 01:30.100
TRUMP IS GOOD AT, IT'S FUCKING

01:30.166 --> 01:31.200
UP CHILDREN FOREVER.

01:31.266 --> 01:32.367
BUT THE MAJOR DRAMA SINCE WE

01:32.433 --> 01:33.133
LEFT HAS BEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

01:33.200 --> 01:34.166
REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO GET

01:34.233 --> 01:35.133
CONGRESS TO FUND HIS BORDER

01:35.200 --> 01:36.133
WALL, INCLUDING SHUTTING THE

01:36.200 --> 01:37.433
GOVERNMENT DOWN FOR NEARLY A

01:37.500 --> 01:38.400
MONTH, AND THIS FRIDAY, HE TRIED

01:38.467 --> 01:40.867
A NEW APPROACH.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.000
>> UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW,

01:42.066 --> 01:43.433
PRESIDENT TRUMP DECLARES A

01:43.500 --> 01:44.533
NATIONAL EMERGENCY IN AN ATTEMPT

01:44.600 --> 01:45.567
TO GET BILLIONS FOR A BORDER

01:45.633 --> 01:47.033
WALL.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.233
>> John: YES, ACCORDING TO

01:48.300 --> 01:49.400
TRUMP, THE BORDER SUDDENLY

01:49.467 --> 01:50.767
CONSTITUTES A NATIONAL

01:50.834 --> 01:52.500
EMERGENCY, OR AS HE MIGHT SPELL

01:52.567 --> 01:53.467
IT IN A TWEET, "THE BERDER

01:53.533 --> 01:54.467
CORNSTIDUTES A NERTIONAL

01:54.533 --> 01:56.967
EDERDENCY."

01:57.033 --> 01:58.233
AND TO BE CLEAR, THERE IS ZERO

01:58.300 --> 01:59.166
ACTUAL EMERGENCY AT THE BORDER

01:59.233 --> 02:00.300
RIGHT NOW.

02:00.367 --> 02:01.467
ILLEGAL CROSSINGS HAVE BEEN

02:01.500 --> 02:03.133
DECLINING FOR 20 YEARS.

02:03.233 --> 02:03.934
AND AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE

02:04.033 --> 02:04.934
ON THIS SHOW, A WALL WOULD BE

02:05.000 --> 02:05.600
EXPENSIVE AND COMPLETELY

02:05.667 --> 02:07.700
INEFFECTIVE.

02:07.767 --> 02:08.567
BUT PUTTING THOSE ASIDE,

02:08.633 --> 02:09.900
DECLARING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY

02:09.967 --> 02:12.133
IS A BIG STEP.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.300
EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS ARE MEANT

02:13.367 --> 02:14.633
TO TEMPORARILY ENHANCE THE

02:14.700 --> 02:15.867
PRESIDENT'S POWER DURING A

02:15.934 --> 02:17.100
LEGITIMATE CRISIS, SO TRUMP

02:17.166 --> 02:18.567
NEEDED TO SELL THIS AS A REAL

02:18.633 --> 02:20.300
EMERGENCY.

02:20.367 --> 02:21.800
AND YET, WITHIN MINUTES OF

02:21.867 --> 02:24.233
DECLARING IT, HE SAID THIS.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.467
>> I COULD DO THE WALL OVER A

02:25.533 --> 02:26.633
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.200
I DIDN'T NEED TO DO THIS.

02:28.266 --> 02:29.700
BUT I'D RATHER DO IT MUCH

02:29.767 --> 02:31.233
FASTER.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.266
>> John: WELL, IT'S NOT AN

02:32.333 --> 02:33.967
EMERGENCY THEN, IS IT?

02:34.033 --> 02:36.066
ALSO, FOR THE RECORD, THERE IS

02:36.133 --> 02:37.934
NO WAY THAT'S THE FIRST TIME

02:38.000 --> 02:39.133
THIS WEEK TRUMP HAS CLAIMED, "I

02:39.200 --> 02:40.266
COULD DO THIS OVER A LONGER

02:40.333 --> 02:41.767
PERIOD OF TIME, I'D JUST RATHER

02:41.834 --> 02:43.834
DO IT MUCH FASTER."

02:43.900 --> 02:45.333
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, YOU TWO.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.033
#CoupleGoals.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.266
AND AS IF THAT WEREN'T BAD

02:49.333 --> 02:50.734
ENOUGH, HE THEN RESPONDED TO

02:50.800 --> 02:51.900
THIS NEWLY DECLARED EMERGENCY

02:51.967 --> 02:53.433
BY, JUST HOURS LATER, FLYING OFF

02:53.500 --> 02:55.133
TO FLORIDA FOR THE WEEKEND,

02:55.200 --> 02:56.633
WHERE HE'S APPARENTLY BEEN

02:56.700 --> 02:57.834
PHOTOGRAPHED WAITING AT AN

02:57.900 --> 02:59.133
OMELET BAR.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.467
YOU KNOW, THE KIND OF THING YOU

03:00.533 --> 03:03.133
DO WHEN AMERICA IS IN CRISIS.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.533
NOW, UNSURPRISINGLY, THERE WERE

03:04.600 --> 03:05.600
LEGAL CHALLENGES FILED ALMOST

03:05.667 --> 03:06.900
INSTANTLY, WHICH SHOCKED NOBODY,

03:06.967 --> 03:10.200
INCLUDING TRUMP HIMSELF.

03:10.266 --> 03:11.567
>> AND WE WILL HAVE A NATIONAL

03:11.633 --> 03:12.934
EMERGENCY, AND WE WILL THEN BE

03:13.000 --> 03:14.767
SUED AND THEY WILL SUE US IN THE

03:14.834 --> 03:16.400
NINTH CIRCUIT -- EVEN THOUGH IT

03:16.467 --> 03:18.033
SHOULDN'T BE THERE -- AND WE

03:18.100 --> 03:20.266
WILL POSSIBLY GET A BAD RULING,

03:20.333 --> 03:22.500
AND THEN WE'LL GET ANOTHER BAD

03:22.567 --> 03:24.567
RULING, AND THEN WE'LL END UP IN

03:24.633 --> 03:26.433
THE SUPREME COURT, AND HOPEFULLY

03:26.500 --> 03:27.834
WE'LL GET A FAIR SHAKE, AND

03:27.900 --> 03:33.200
WE'LL WIN IN THE SUPREME COURT.

03:33.266 --> 03:34.633
>> John: YOU KNOW, YET ANOTHER

03:34.700 --> 03:35.467
GREAT REASON FOR TRUMP TO NOT BE

03:35.533 --> 03:36.834
PRESIDENT IS THAT NOW I KIND OF

03:36.900 --> 03:37.934
WANT TO SEE HIM AS A HISTORICAL

03:38.000 --> 03:38.934
EXPERT ON THE NEXT KEN BURNS

03:39.000 --> 03:40.200
MINISERIES.

03:40.266 --> 03:41.633
"THEY KILLED THE ARCHDUKE AND

03:41.700 --> 03:43.166
GERMANY GOT MAD, AND THEN THERE

03:43.233 --> 03:45.533
WERE TANKS AND ALSO POISON GAS,

03:45.600 --> 03:47.000
AND THERE WAS A BEAGLE ON A

03:47.066 --> 03:48.500
DOGHOUSE FLYING AROUND SHOOTING

03:48.567 --> 03:50.200
AT PEOPLE, AND THEN AMERICA

03:50.266 --> 03:52.567
WON."

03:52.633 --> 03:53.767
LOOK, THERE WILL BE PLENTY MORE

03:53.834 --> 03:55.066
TO SAY ABOUT TRUMP'S BORDER WALL

03:55.133 --> 03:56.367
GOING FORWARD, BUT FOR NOW, I'D

03:56.433 --> 03:57.767
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IKEA: VOTED

03:57.834 --> 03:58.800
NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD BY

03:58.867 --> 04:00.033
"PLACES TO END YOUR MARRIAGE"

04:00.100 --> 04:01.767
MAGAZINE.

04:01.834 --> 04:03.467
LAST WEEK, IKEA APOLOGIZED AFTER

04:03.533 --> 04:09.200
MAKING AN EMBARRASSING MISTAKE.

04:09.266 --> 04:10.333
>> IKEA IS FACING CRITICISM

04:10.400 --> 04:11.367
AFTER SELLING A MAP THAT HAD A

04:11.433 --> 04:12.433
LITTLE SOMETHING MISSING.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.700
CUSTOMERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

04:13.767 --> 04:15.133
NOTICED THE $30 MAP OF THE WORLD

04:15.200 --> 04:16.767
FORGOT TO SHOW NEW ZEALAND.

04:16.834 --> 04:18.533
IT'S BAD TIMING FOR IKEA BECAUSE

04:18.600 --> 04:20.467
THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF

04:20.533 --> 04:22.600
OPENING ITS FIRST STORE THERE.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.900
OOPS.

04:24.967 --> 04:27.033
>> John: YEAH, "OOPS," INDEED.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.767
I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IS MORE

04:28.834 --> 04:29.867
SURPRISING THERE, THAT IKEA

04:29.934 --> 04:31.133
FORGOT NEW ZEALAND OR THAT IKEA

04:31.200 --> 04:33.533
SELLS WORLD MAPS FOR $30.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.934
BEAR IN MIND, YOU CAN BUY AN

04:35.000 --> 04:36.567
ENTIRE DINING ROOM TABLE AT IKEA

04:36.633 --> 04:39.100
FOR $39.

04:39.166 --> 04:40.734
SO BY THAT PRICING, A WORLD MAP

04:40.800 --> 04:44.233
SHOULD COST NEGATIVE $40.

04:44.333 --> 04:45.400
NOW, INCREDIBLY, THIS IS NOT

04:45.500 --> 04:46.533
EVEN THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS

04:46.600 --> 04:48.266
HAPPENED TO NEW ZEALAND.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.033
THEIR PRIME MINISTER OPENLY

04:49.100 --> 04:51.433
COMPLAINED ABOUT IT LAST YEAR.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.533
>> WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY ON EVERY

04:52.600 --> 04:53.867
MAP THAT'S OUT THERE, SO...

04:53.934 --> 04:55.166
>> SERIOUSLY?

04:55.233 --> 04:55.900
>> NO, IT'S ACTUALLY A REAL

04:55.967 --> 04:56.867
PROBLEM.

04:56.934 --> 04:58.300
WE'VE HAD A CAMPAIGN AROUND IT.

04:58.367 --> 04:59.300
YUP, THERE ARE MAPS WHERE WE ARE

04:59.367 --> 05:00.100
MISSING.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.266
>> NO!

05:01.333 --> 05:02.867
>> John: YES.

05:02.934 --> 05:04.000
IT'S HONESTLY TRUE.

05:04.066 --> 05:05.033
NEW ZEALAND GETS LEFT OFF MAPS

05:05.100 --> 05:06.333
ALL THE TIME.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.400
NOW, DO I THINK THAT THAT IS

05:07.467 --> 05:08.100
FUNNY?

05:08.166 --> 05:09.333
YES.

05:09.400 --> 05:09.800
YES, I DO.

05:09.867 --> 05:10.734
YES.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.834
NEW ZEALAND, A PLACE THAT'S

05:11.900 --> 05:12.967
BASICALLY TIMES SQUARE IF ALL

05:13.033 --> 05:14.133
THE PEOPLE WERE SHEEP AND IF ALL

05:14.200 --> 05:16.133
THE NEON SIGNS WERE ALSO SHEEP,

05:16.200 --> 05:18.033
KEEPS GETTING PICKED NEVER IN

05:18.100 --> 05:20.533
THE DODGEBALL GAME OF MAPS.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.133
THAT IS OBJECTIVELY FUNNY TO ME.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.166
BUT THIS IS A SURPRISINGLY

05:24.233 --> 05:25.033
COMMON OCCURRENCE.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.033
THERE'S BOTH A SUBREDDIT AND A

05:26.100 --> 05:27.233
TUMBLR DEDICATED TO COLLECTING

05:27.300 --> 05:28.333
EXAMPLES OF MAPS WITHOUT

05:28.400 --> 05:30.000
NEW ZEALAND ON THEM.

05:30.066 --> 05:31.467
FOR EXAMPLE, IT'S APPARENTLY

05:31.533 --> 05:32.533
BEEN LEFT OUT FROM THIS TEXTBOOK

05:32.600 --> 05:33.767
ILLUSTRATION, THIS BOX FROM

05:33.834 --> 05:34.900
TIFFANY'S, AND THE BOARD GAME

05:34.967 --> 05:36.600
"RISK," AS WELL AS ON LARGE MAPS

05:36.667 --> 05:37.867
IN MULTIPLE MAJOR AIRPORTS,

05:37.934 --> 05:39.333
INCLUDING MUNICH, BEIJING, AND

05:39.400 --> 05:41.934
PRAGUE, WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION:

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
WHERE DO THESE AIRPORTS THINK

05:44.066 --> 05:45.600
FLIGHTS TO NEW ZEALAND ARE

05:45.667 --> 05:47.934
GOING?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.033
"WE ARE NOW BOARDING THE 8:55 TO

05:49.100 --> 05:50.266
AUCKLAND.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.166
NOT SURE WHERE OR WHAT THAT IS,

05:51.233 --> 05:52.333
SO FROM EVERYONE HERE AT

05:52.400 --> 05:53.400
DELTA AIRLINES, WE WISH YOU A

05:53.467 --> 05:55.834
SINCERE GOOD LUCK."

05:55.900 --> 05:57.333
AND LOOK, WHETHER YOU LIKE

05:57.400 --> 05:58.533
NEW ZEALAND OR NOT, YOU CAN'T

05:58.600 --> 06:00.233
DENY IT IS THERE.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.867
IT'S NOT JUST AUSTRALIA'S

06:01.934 --> 06:04.300
IMAGINARY FRIEND.

06:04.367 --> 06:05.533
AND THEY ARE TRYING THEIR BEST.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.967
THEY DID HAVE AN OFFICIAL

06:07.033 --> 06:08.700
CAMPAIGN JUST LAST YEAR USING

06:08.767 --> 06:10.233
THE HASHTAG

06:10.300 --> 06:11.734
#GetNewZealandOnTheMap,

06:11.800 --> 06:14.633
BUT IT CLEARLY DIDN'T WORK.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.967
SO TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO

06:16.033 --> 06:17.066
HELP THEM OUT BY GIVING PEOPLE A

06:17.133 --> 06:18.133
PRACTICAL WAY TO PUT THINGS

06:18.200 --> 06:19.533
RIGHT HERE.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.767
SO IF YOU GO TO OUR TWITTER FEED

06:20.834 --> 06:22.100
RIGHT NOW, YOU'LL FIND A MAP OF

06:22.166 --> 06:24.066
NEW ZEALAND YOU CAN PRINT OUT

06:24.133 --> 06:25.567
AND ADD TO ANY INCORRECT MAP OF

06:25.633 --> 06:27.467
YOUR CHOOSING.

06:27.533 --> 06:29.166
IF YOU OWN THAT IKEA MAP?

06:29.233 --> 06:31.567
ADD NEW ZEALAND RIGHT THERE.

06:31.633 --> 06:32.934
IF YOU HAVE THE BOARD GAME

06:33.000 --> 06:34.500
"RISK," ADD NEW ZEALAND.

06:34.567 --> 06:36.033
AND THEN THROW IT AWAY BECAUSE

06:36.133 --> 06:38.233
IT'S A TERRIBLE GAME.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.467
AND ALSO WHY STOP WITH

06:39.533 --> 06:40.300
INACCURATE MAPS?

06:40.367 --> 06:41.066
YOU CAN PUT NEW ZEALAND ON

06:41.133 --> 06:41.934
EVERYTHING.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.734

ORGANS?

06:47.200 --> 06:48.700
ADD NEW ZEALAND.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.400
IN FACT, ADD TWO.

06:50.467 --> 06:52.300
AND, FINALLY, IF YOU SHOULD EVER

06:52.367 --> 06:53.967
FIND YOURSELF IN AN IKEA, YOU

07:10.533 --> 07:11.700
WINNER OF THE WESTMINSTER

07:11.767 --> 07:13.734
DOG SHOW.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.734
>> THIS IS NOT MY FAVORITE BREED

07:14.800 --> 07:16.033
OF DOG.

07:16.100 --> 07:16.967
I JUST DON'T FIND IT VERY

07:17.033 --> 07:18.166
ATTRACTIVE.

07:18.233 --> 07:19.100
>> IT'S NOT MY FAVORITE-LOOKING

07:19.166 --> 07:20.300
DOG.

07:20.367 --> 07:23.767
>> IT'S RIDICULOUS.

07:23.834 --> 07:24.500
>> SO GOOFY, THAT FACE.

07:24.567 --> 07:25.100
>> HE LOOKS SNOBBY.

07:25.166 --> 07:26.066
>> THAT DOG LOOKS LIKE IN THE

07:26.133 --> 07:27.100
MORNING HE WAKES UP AND SIPS TEA

07:27.133 --> 07:28.333
AND EATS CRUMPETS.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.166
>> HE SHOULD GET A SHAVE.

07:32.233 --> 07:32.734
>> THAT BEARD.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.433
>> PUFFY LEGS, PUFFY CHIN.

07:33.500 --> 07:34.433
>> GOOFY-LOOKING DOG.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.867
>> DOES THAT DOG HAVE KNEES?

07:36.934 --> 07:40.767
>> HE NEEDS A SHAVE.

07:40.834 --> 07:44.767
>> NO, IT'S OKAY.

07:44.834 --> 07:48.533
>> ARTHUR CHESTER LOOK, OR

07:48.600 --> 07:55.767
CHESTER A. ARTHUR.

07:55.834 --> 07:56.300
I GAVE YOU THE PHONE BOOK

07:56.367 --> 07:56.600
VERSION.

07:56.667 --> 07:57.233
>> EITHER WAY, I DON'T KNOW.

07:57.300 --> 07:57.967
>> CHESTER ARTHUR.

07:58.033 --> 07:58.633
YOU DON'T KNOW?

07:58.700 --> 07:59.300
HE WAS PRESIDENT?

07:59.367 --> 07:59.967
>> HE WAS NOT PRESIDENT.

08:00.033 --> 08:00.667
>> CHESTER ARTHUR?

08:00.734 --> 08:01.500
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

08:01.567 --> 08:02.033
>> 100% SURE.

08:02.100 --> 08:02.700
>> WHO AM I THINKING OF?

08:02.767 --> 08:03.400
>> I DON'T KNOW.

08:03.467 --> 08:04.066
TAFT?

08:04.133 --> 08:06.400
I HAVE NO IDEA.

08:06.467 --> 08:07.000
WOODROW WILSON?

08:07.066 --> 08:07.700
>> NO, IT WAS BEFORE THAT.

08:07.767 --> 08:08.400
I THINK IT WAS CHESTER A.

08:08.467 --> 08:09.033
ARTHUR.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.166
>> THERE WAS NO PRESIDENT NAMED

08:12.233 --> 08:13.100
CHESTER A. -- JESSE, LOOK IT UP.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.133
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.500
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:21.567 --> 08:23.133
AN ISSUE THAT PROMISES TO

08:23.233 --> 08:25.233
DOMINATE THIS ENTIRE YEAR,

08:25.300 --> 08:26.467
BREXIT, THE PLAYFUL, FUN NAME

08:26.533 --> 08:28.200
THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO A DISASTER.

08:28.266 --> 08:29.734
IT'S LIKE IF YOU SAID

08:29.800 --> 08:31.300
AN ANIMAL DIED OF

08:31.367 --> 08:33.100
"OTTER-EROTIC ASPHYXIATION."

08:33.166 --> 08:36.633
IT'S CUTE, ALTHOUGH WHEN YOU

08:36.700 --> 08:40.667
THINK ABOUT THE ACTUAL

08:40.734 --> 08:41.367
CONSEQUENCES, IT BECOMES QUITE

08:41.433 --> 08:42.100
SAD.

08:42.166 --> 08:42.767
IT'S NOW BEEN TWO AND A HALF

08:42.834 --> 08:43.400
YEARS SINCE BRITAIN VOTED TO

08:43.467 --> 08:44.133
LEAVE THE EU.

08:44.200 --> 08:44.967
THE LONG STORY SHORT IS, THERE

08:45.033 --> 08:45.867
WAS A BUS WITH A LIE ON IT,

08:45.934 --> 08:47.967
PEOPLE MADE A MASSIVELY

08:48.033 --> 08:48.800
CONSEQUENTIAL DECISION BY A

08:48.867 --> 08:49.567
NARROW MARGIN, AND EVER SINCE,

08:49.633 --> 08:50.333
THE SUBJECT OF THE IMPENDING

08:50.400 --> 08:51.300
BREXIT HAS DOMINATED EVERY

08:51.367 --> 08:52.600
WAKING MOMENT IN BRITISH LIFE.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.033
IT EVEN COMES UP ON REALITY

08:54.100 --> 08:55.233
SHOWS LIKE THIS ONE, CALLED

08:55.300 --> 08:56.967
"LOVE ISLAND."

08:57.033 --> 08:58.433
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

08:58.500 --> 08:59.333
BREXIT?

08:59.400 --> 09:00.333
>> WHAT'S THAT?

09:00.400 --> 09:01.633
>> WHERE WE'RE LEAVING THE

09:01.700 --> 09:03.467
EUROPEAN UNION.

09:03.533 --> 09:04.233
>> I SERIOUSLY DON'T HAVE A

09:04.300 --> 09:05.667
CLUE.

09:05.734 --> 09:07.500
>> SO IT WAS TO LEAVE THE EU SO

09:07.567 --> 09:08.100
WE WOULDN'T BE PART OF EUROPE.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.667
>> OH, THE EU, YEAH, YEAH.

09:09.734 --> 09:10.400
>> WHICH WOULD MEAN, LIKE,

09:10.467 --> 09:12.367
WELFARE, AND, LIKE, THINGS WE

09:12.433 --> 09:13.400
TRADE WITH WOULD BE CUT DOWN.

09:13.467 --> 09:15.734
>> SO DOES THAT MEAN WE WON'T

09:15.800 --> 09:16.934
HAVE ANY TREES?

09:16.967 --> 09:18.233
>> CHEESE?

09:18.300 --> 09:21.000
>> TREES.

09:21.066 --> 09:22.400
>> NO, THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO

09:22.467 --> 09:23.233
WITH IT, BABE, THAT'S WEATHER.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.433
>> WHY WOULDN'T WE HAVE TREES?

09:24.500 --> 09:27.033
>> BUT DOESN'T IT MEAN IT WOULD

09:27.100 --> 09:27.667
BE HARDER TO GO TO, LIKE, SPAIN

09:27.734 --> 09:28.400
AND STUFF?

09:28.467 --> 09:29.266
>> SO IT WOULD BE HARDER TO GO

09:29.333 --> 09:30.066
ON HOLIDAYS?

09:30.133 --> 09:30.900
>> YEAH, I THINK SO.

09:30.967 --> 09:31.867
>> OH, I LOVE MY HOLIDAYS!

09:31.934 --> 09:33.934
>> YEAH.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.667
>> John: OKAY, SO THERE'S A LOT

09:35.734 --> 09:36.700
TO UNPACK THERE, ABSOLUTELY NONE

09:36.767 --> 09:42.033
OF WHICH IS WORTH UNPACKING.

09:42.100 --> 09:42.867
IT'S LIKE COMING OVER TO HELP A

09:42.934 --> 09:43.767
FRIEND MOVE AND FINDING ALL HIS

09:43.834 --> 09:44.800
BOXES ARE LABELED "DEAD SPIDERS

09:44.867 --> 09:46.300
FOR MOMMY."

09:46.367 --> 09:47.567
YEAH, YOU COULD UNPACK THAT, BUT

09:47.633 --> 09:48.500
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER TO JUST

09:48.567 --> 09:49.467
BURN EVERYTHING TO THE GROUND

09:49.533 --> 09:50.834
AND NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN.

09:50.900 --> 09:52.800
THE POINT IS, YOU CANNOT ESCAPE

09:52.867 --> 09:54.567
TALK ABOUT BREXIT IN THE UK.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.100
IT'S SOMETHING BRILLIANTLY

09:56.166 --> 09:57.667
CAPTURED BY A TV SHOW CALLED

09:57.734 --> 09:58.800
"GOGGLEBOX."

09:58.867 --> 10:00.033
IT'S A SHOW IN BRITAIN WHERE YOU

10:00.100 --> 10:00.667
GET TO WATCH OTHER PEOPLE WATCH

10:00.734 --> 10:01.867
TV.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.333
IT'S ACTUALLY GREAT, TRUST ME.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.133
JUST EAVESDROP ON SOME BRITISH

10:04.200 --> 10:07.600
PEOPLE WATCHING THE NEWS.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.166
>> WHY DID DAVID CAMERON CALL A

10:09.233 --> 10:13.066
REFERENDUM IN THE FIRST PLACE?

10:13.133 --> 10:14.633
>> HE SHOULD BE PUT IN PRISON.

10:14.700 --> 10:15.233
>> BRITAIN WANTS TO HAVE THEIR

10:15.300 --> 10:16.033
CAKE AND EAT IT.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.367
THEY WANT TO TRADE WITH THE REST

10:17.433 --> 10:18.567
OF THE WORLD, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE

10:18.633 --> 10:19.367
THE BENEFIT OF TRADING WITH

10:19.433 --> 10:21.600
EUROPE.

10:21.667 --> 10:22.967
>> I'M HALFWAY THROUGH THE

10:23.033 --> 10:25.834
585-PAGE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.200
>> NO!

10:27.266 --> 10:29.266
WHO ARE YOU?

10:29.333 --> 10:30.967
>> IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE MUGS I

10:31.033 --> 10:33.633
SAW IN PUDSEY, MARY.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.033
"DIFFERENT DAY, SAME OLD SHIT."

10:36.100 --> 10:37.700
MARY.

10:37.767 --> 10:38.900
>> I DON'T LIKE YOU SWEARING.

10:38.967 --> 10:40.200
>> I SAW IT ON A MUG.

10:40.266 --> 10:41.100
I'M JUST QUOTING WHAT I READ ON

10:41.166 --> 10:41.834
A MUG.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.133
>> OKAY.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.266
>> John: "HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE

10:44.333 --> 10:45.567
I SAW ON A MUG, MARY.

10:45.633 --> 10:47.033
IT SAID: 'THIS MARRIAGE IS LIKE

10:47.100 --> 10:48.133
A LOCOMOTIVE LYING ON MY CHEST,

10:48.200 --> 10:49.300
CRUSHING MY SPIRIT TO DUST.'

10:49.367 --> 10:50.500
I'M JUST QUOTING WHAT I SAW ON A

10:50.567 --> 10:51.233
MUG, MARY.

10:51.300 --> 10:54.734
DON'T BLAME ME, BLAME THE MUG."

10:54.800 --> 10:56.934
PEOPLE IN BRITAIN ARE EXHAUSTED

10:57.000 --> 10:58.266
BY BREXIT TALK, AND THE CRAZY

10:58.333 --> 10:59.867
THING IS, IT HASN'T EVEN

10:59.934 --> 11:01.333
HAPPENED YET, ALTHOUGH IT HAS

11:01.400 --> 11:02.734
ALREADY HAD BIG EFFECTS ON THE

11:02.800 --> 11:07.100
BRITISH ECONOMY.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.667
IN THE WAKE OF THE BREXIT VOTE,

11:08.734 --> 11:09.633
THE UK HAS BECOME ONE OF THE

11:09.700 --> 11:10.834
WORST-PERFORMING ECONOMIES IN

11:10.900 --> 11:12.000
THE G-7, MAJOR COMPANIES LIKE

11:12.066 --> 11:12.567
NISSAN AND DYSON ARE MOVING

11:12.633 --> 11:13.433
OPERATIONS OUT OF BRITAIN, AND

11:13.500 --> 11:14.800
THE POUND HAS DROPPED BY ALMOST

11:14.867 --> 11:16.400
14%.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.400
AND ALL OF THIS WILL COME TO A

11:17.467 --> 11:18.800
HEAD JUST 40 DAYS FROM NOW, ON

11:18.867 --> 11:20.066
MARCH 29, WHEN THE UK IS SET TO

11:20.133 --> 11:23.667
OFFICIALLY LEAVE THE EU.

11:23.734 --> 11:25.633
AND IT COULD BE AN ABSOLUTE

11:25.700 --> 11:26.834
CATASTROPHE BECAUSE NOTHING IS

11:26.900 --> 11:27.967
HAPPENING THE WAY THAT WAS

11:28.033 --> 11:29.467
PROMISED.

11:29.533 --> 11:31.367
BRITAIN WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE

11:31.433 --> 11:32.934
THE EU IN ORDERLY STAGES, FIRST

11:33.000 --> 11:35.166
ENTERING A TRANSITION PERIOD ON

11:35.233 --> 11:36.600
MARCH 29, DURING WHICH IT WOULD

11:36.667 --> 11:38.000
NEGOTIATE ITS FUTURE

11:38.066 --> 11:39.367
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EU AND

11:39.433 --> 11:42.300
THEN LEAVE ENTIRELY.

11:42.367 --> 11:43.934
AND PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY

11:44.000 --> 11:45.166
HAS SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS

11:45.233 --> 11:46.667
LOCKING DOWN THE TERMS OF THAT

11:46.734 --> 11:48.200
TRANSITION PLAN WITH THE EU.

11:48.266 --> 11:49.266
BUT WHEN SHE PRESENTED THIS

11:49.333 --> 11:50.400
AGREED-UPON DEAL TO PARLIAMENT,

11:50.467 --> 11:52.300
THIS HAPPENED.

11:52.367 --> 11:54.000
>> THERESA MAY SUFFERS THE

11:54.066 --> 11:55.300
BIGGEST COMMONS DEFEAT IN

11:55.367 --> 11:56.734
HISTORY.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.834
>> THIS WAS THE MOMENT THE

11:57.900 --> 12:01.133
DEFEAT WAS ANNOUNCED.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.433
>> THE AYES TO THE RIGHT, 202.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.200
THE NOS TO THE LEFT, 432.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.166
>> John: WHAT WAS THAT NOISE?

12:11.233 --> 12:12.667
THAT WAS THE BIGGEST COMMONS

12:12.734 --> 12:13.967
DEFEAT IN BRITISH HISTORY AND

12:14.033 --> 12:15.066
THEY SOUNDED LIKE A

12:15.133 --> 12:15.967
MIDDLE SCHOOL LUNCHROOM WHO JUST

12:16.033 --> 12:16.734
HEARD SOMEONE CALLED TO THE

12:16.800 --> 12:22.467
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.800
"OH, THERESA'S IN TROU-BLE!"

12:23.867 --> 12:25.734
NOW, INCIDENTALLY, WE CAN'T SHOW

12:25.800 --> 12:26.367
THAT MOMENT IN THE UK BECAUSE OF

12:26.433 --> 12:28.100
THEIR DUMB LAW BANNING

12:28.166 --> 12:29.467
PARLIAMENTARY FOOTAGE IN COMEDY

12:29.533 --> 12:32.700
SHOWS, SO WHEN THIS AIRS THERE

12:32.767 --> 12:34.467
TOMORROW NIGHT, IT'LL BE

12:34.533 --> 12:35.800
REPLACED BY A CLIP FROM A 1983

12:35.867 --> 12:37.033
CHIPPENDALES EXERCISE VIDEO

12:37.100 --> 12:38.066
INSTEAD WITH ABSOLUTELY NO

12:38.133 --> 12:40.800
EXPLANATION.

12:40.867 --> 12:42.033
SO THIS IS WHAT THEY'LL SEE:

12:42.100 --> 12:43.200
>> THIS IS THE MOMENT THE DEFEAT

12:43.266 --> 12:44.200
WAS ANNOUNCED.

12:54.133 --> 12:55.500
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT

12:55.567 --> 12:55.967
THEY'LL GET.

12:56.033 --> 12:56.767
THEY'LL BE CONFUSED BY IT, AND

12:56.834 --> 13:00.433
IT'LL BE ALL THEIR FAULT.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.000
THE POINT IS, THE DEFEAT OF

13:01.066 --> 13:01.433
THERESA MAY'S DEAL

13:01.500 --> 13:02.533
RAISES THE SPECTER OF WHAT MANY

13:02.600 --> 13:03.133
CONSIDER TO BE THE WORST-CASE

13:03.200 --> 13:03.734
SCENARIO HERE: THE UK DROPPING

13:03.800 --> 13:04.600
OUT OF THE EU NEXT MONTH WITH NO

13:04.667 --> 13:06.300
TRANSITION PLAN IN PLACE.

13:06.367 --> 13:07.567
IT'S THE SO-CALLED NO-DEAL

13:07.633 --> 13:08.967
SCENARIO, AND THE RAMIFICATIONS

13:09.033 --> 13:10.400
OF THAT COULD BE MASSIVE, NOT

13:10.467 --> 13:13.066
JUST FOR THE UK OR THE EU, BUT

13:13.133 --> 13:15.100
FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD.

13:15.166 --> 13:16.900
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TRY AND ANSWER

13:16.967 --> 13:18.800
A FEW QUESTIONS: WHY DON'T

13:18.867 --> 13:19.967
PEOPLE LIKE THERESA MAY'S DEAL?

13:20.033 --> 13:21.066
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE UK LEAVES

13:21.133 --> 13:22.467
WITH NO DEAL?

13:22.533 --> 13:23.967
AND COULD THEY JUST NOT DO

13:24.033 --> 13:25.433
BREXIT AT ALL?

13:25.500 --> 13:26.533
AND LET'S START WITH WHY

13:26.600 --> 13:27.667
PARLIAMENT REJECTED HER DEAL.

13:27.734 --> 13:28.800
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS THAT

13:28.867 --> 13:30.000
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT, BUT THE

13:30.066 --> 13:31.100
BIGGEST STICKING POINT HAS TO DO

13:31.166 --> 13:32.300
WITH NORTHERN IRELAND.

13:32.367 --> 13:33.400
AND LET ME EXPLAIN HERE.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.400
YOU SEE, THE UK IS ACTUALLY FOUR

13:35.467 --> 13:37.100
COUNTRIES: ENGLAND, SCOTLAND,

13:37.166 --> 13:39.333
WALES, AND NORTHERN IRELAND.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.066
A FAB FOUR, SORT OF LIKE THE

13:41.133 --> 13:42.700
BEATLES.

13:42.767 --> 13:43.734
I WON'T SAY WHO THE RINGO IS,

13:43.800 --> 13:46.100
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO

13:46.166 --> 13:47.367
WALES.

13:47.433 --> 13:48.767
NOW, NORTHERN IRELAND SHARES A

13:48.800 --> 13:50.166
BORDER WITH THE REPUBLIC OF

13:50.233 --> 13:51.333
IRELAND, AND RIGHT NOW,

13:51.400 --> 13:52.767
EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE IS PART

13:52.834 --> 13:54.633
OF THE EU, SO GOODS AND PEOPLE

13:54.700 --> 13:56.400
CAN MOVE FREELY BETWEEN THEM.

13:56.467 --> 13:57.700
BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF BREXIT IS

13:57.767 --> 13:59.333
FOR THE UK TO LEAVE THE EU, AND

13:59.400 --> 14:01.333
THAT COULD PUT A HARD BORDER

14:01.400 --> 14:02.834
ACROSS IRELAND, AND THAT COULD

14:02.900 --> 14:05.166
BE A PROBLEM IN A REGION THAT'S

14:05.233 --> 14:06.767
BEEN PLAGUED BY SECTARIAN

14:06.834 --> 14:08.033
VIOLENCE.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.400
AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET

14:09.467 --> 14:10.467
INTO THE SOCIOPOLITICAL HISTORY

14:10.533 --> 14:12.867
OF IRELAND RIGHT NOW.

14:12.934 --> 14:14.200
SO FEEL FREE TO GOOGLE

14:14.266 --> 14:15.000
"IRA BOMBINGS" OR

14:15.066 --> 14:17.066
"BLOODY SUNDAY," OR

14:17.133 --> 14:18.467
"DANIEL DAY-LEWIS' 1990s FILM

14:18.533 --> 14:20.600
OUTPUT" OR -- DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:20.667 --> 14:21.233
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:21.300 --> 14:25.200
I'LL JUST LET THE CRANBERRIES

14:25.266 --> 14:26.033
10 SECONDS.

14:26.100 --> 14:26.867
>> ♪ WITH THEIR TANKS

14:26.934 --> 14:28.100
AND THEIR BOMBS ♪

14:28.166 --> 14:28.800
♪ AND THEIR BOMBS

14:28.867 --> 14:30.533
AND THEIR GUNS ♪

14:30.600 --> 14:31.133
♪ IN YOUR HEAD, IN YOUR HEAD

14:31.200 --> 14:38.900
THEY ARE DYING ♪

14:38.967 --> 14:39.867
>> John: THAT'S BASICALLY IT.

14:39.934 --> 14:40.633
TANKS, BOMBS, GUNS, ABSOLUTELY

14:40.700 --> 14:42.133
NO MORE THAN FOUR CHORDS.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.033
YOU KNOW, IRELAND.

14:43.100 --> 14:43.934
IN THE "TROUBLES," THOUSANDS OF

14:44.000 --> 14:44.867
PEOPLE DIED.

14:44.934 --> 14:46.133
BUSINESSES ON THE BORDER WERE

14:46.200 --> 14:47.033
REGULARLY BOMBED, AND

14:47.100 --> 14:48.567
CHECKPOINTS BECAME TARGETS.

14:48.633 --> 14:50.934
SO REMOVING THEM WAS A

14:51.000 --> 14:52.667
CENTERPIECE TO THE HISTORIC

14:52.734 --> 14:54.133
GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT OF 1998,

14:54.200 --> 14:55.467
WHICH BROUGHT A FRAGILE PEACE TO

14:55.533 --> 14:57.934
THE WHOLE REGION.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.567
RETURNING TO CHECKPOINTS IN ANY

14:59.633 --> 15:01.000
WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM IS GOING TO

15:01.066 --> 15:02.400
RE-INFLAME TENSIONS, AS PEOPLE

15:02.467 --> 15:04.934
WHO LIVE THERE KNOW.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.767
>> IF SOMEBODY BUILDS A CUSTOMS

15:06.834 --> 15:08.367
POST ON THE BORDER BETWEEN THE

15:08.433 --> 15:09.567
NORTH AND SOUTHERN IRELAND,

15:09.633 --> 15:11.066
PEOPLE WILL SHOOT AT IT.

15:11.133 --> 15:12.467
AND THEY'LL SHOOT AT THE PEOPLE

15:12.533 --> 15:14.000
WHO WORK AT IT.

15:14.066 --> 15:15.400
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY 100% CERTAIN.

15:15.467 --> 15:23.200
>> John: WOW.

15:23.266 --> 15:23.734
THAT IS STRIKING, BECAUSE

15:23.800 --> 15:24.667
NORMALLY FOR PEOPLE TO

15:24.734 --> 15:25.300
BE THAT CERTAIN SOMETHING WILL

15:25.367 --> 15:26.233
BE A DISASTER, THEY NEED TO SEE

15:26.300 --> 15:27.200
WILL SMITH IN BLUEFACE.

15:27.266 --> 15:28.367
SO EVERYONE AGREES THERE CANNOT

15:28.433 --> 15:29.934
BE A HARD BORDER THERE AGAIN.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.166
BUT HOW DO YOU AVOID THAT?

15:32.233 --> 15:34.066
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE EU,

15:34.133 --> 15:36.133
GOODS HAVE TO BE SCREENED

15:36.200 --> 15:37.967
SOMEWHERE, LIKE YOU WOULD AT ANY

15:38.033 --> 15:39.500
INTERNATIONAL BORDER, AND NO ONE

15:39.567 --> 15:42.800
HAS YET COME UP WITH A PLAUSIBLE

15:42.867 --> 15:43.200
SOLUTION FOR THIS.

15:43.266 --> 15:43.900
SOME, INCLUDING FORMER FOREIGN

15:43.967 --> 15:45.166
SECRETARY AND UNTITLED

15:45.233 --> 15:46.266
GARY BUSEY PROJECT

15:46.333 --> 15:48.266
BORIS JOHNSON, HAVE PROPOSED

15:48.333 --> 15:49.367
ELABORATE WORKAROUNDS, INCLUDING

15:49.433 --> 15:50.667
TECHNOLOGIES THAT DON'T YET

15:50.734 --> 15:52.500
EXIST AND CUSTOMS SCREENINGS

15:52.567 --> 15:55.834
NEAR, BUT NOT AT, THE BORDER.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.166
BUT IRELAND IS NOT REMOTELY

15:57.233 --> 15:58.734
CONVINCED BY THOSE.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.066
AND WHEN JOURNALISTS PUSHED

16:00.133 --> 16:01.533
BORIS JOHNSON FOR MORE DETAILS,

16:01.600 --> 16:02.867
HIS RESPONSE DID NOT INSPIRE

16:02.934 --> 16:05.633
CONFIDENCE.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.033
>> NOBODY THINKS IT'S A

16:07.100 --> 16:07.967
REALISTIC PLAN, BECAUSE THEY

16:08.033 --> 16:09.300
DON'T THINK IRELAND WOULD ACCEPT

16:09.367 --> 16:09.500
IT.

16:09.567 --> 16:10.100
>> THE EU DOES.

16:10.166 --> 16:10.900
>> DON'T -- DON'T RUN AWAY.

16:10.967 --> 16:11.533
WE WANT TO ASK YOU SOME SERIOUS

16:11.600 --> 16:12.367
QUESTIONS, BECAUSE YOU'VE JUST

16:12.433 --> 16:13.066
DONE A LOAD OF INTERVIEWS, WHY

16:13.133 --> 16:19.734
DON'T YOU TALK TO CHANNEL FOUR?

16:19.800 --> 16:20.367
AND ANSWER -- ANSWER A COUPLE OF

16:20.433 --> 16:21.033
QUESTIONS?

16:21.100 --> 16:21.633
>> YOU...

16:21.700 --> 16:22.633
>> THIS IS ABSURD.

16:22.700 --> 16:23.166
YOU WANT TO HAVE A SERIOUS

16:23.233 --> 16:23.767
CONVERSATION ABOUT BREXIT AND

16:23.834 --> 16:24.900
THEN YOU RIDE OFF WITHOUT

16:24.967 --> 16:25.233
TALKING TO US.

16:25.300 --> 16:26.033
WHY CAN'T YOU ANSWER ANY SERIOUS

16:26.100 --> 16:26.734
QUESTIONS?

16:26.800 --> 16:27.967
>> JOHN:I'LL TELL YOU WHY BORIS

16:28.033 --> 16:28.800
CAN'T ANSWER ANY SERIOUS

16:28.867 --> 16:29.400
QUESTIONS: HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY

16:29.467 --> 16:32.200
ANSWERS.

16:32.266 --> 16:32.834
IN FACT, THE ONLY QUESTION HE'S

16:32.900 --> 16:33.500
EVER CAPABLE OF ANSWERING IS,

16:33.567 --> 16:34.633
"WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE IF

16:34.700 --> 16:35.367
GORDON RAMSEY WAS TUMBLE-DRIED

16:35.433 --> 16:40.100
ON HIGH?"

16:40.166 --> 16:40.900
SO JUST IN CASE NO ONE COMES UP

16:40.967 --> 16:41.800
WITH A SOLUTION FOR THIS

16:41.867 --> 16:43.867
UN-FIXABLE PROBLEM BY THE END OF

16:43.934 --> 16:45.033
THE TRANSITION PERIOD, THE EU

16:45.100 --> 16:45.934
AND THERESA MAY AGREED ON

16:46.000 --> 16:53.166
SOMETHING CALLED A "BACKSTOP."

16:53.233 --> 16:53.900
NOW, UNDER IT, NORTHERN IRELAND

16:53.967 --> 16:54.834
WOULD BROADLY LIVE UNDER EU

16:54.900 --> 16:56.133
RULES AND THERE WOULD BE A HARD

16:56.200 --> 16:57.433
BORDER BETWEEN IT AND THE REST

16:57.500 --> 16:58.600
OF THE UK, AND THAT WOULD REMAIN

16:58.667 --> 16:59.800
IN EFFECT UNTIL THEY CAME UP

16:59.867 --> 17:01.467
WITH A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THE

17:01.533 --> 17:02.433
BORDER PROBLEM -- A SOLUTION

17:02.500 --> 17:03.700
THAT, REMEMBER, DOES NOT EXIST.

17:03.767 --> 17:06.600
THE PROBLEM IS, BREXITEERS HAVE

17:06.667 --> 17:07.900
STRONG RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE

17:07.967 --> 17:10.266
BACKSTOP, AND THEY WANT THERESA

17:10.333 --> 17:11.300
MAY TO RENEGOTIATE IT.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.066
BUT THE EU SAYS THEY'RE DONE

17:13.133 --> 17:14.433
NEGOTIATING, LEAVING BRITAIN

17:14.500 --> 17:15.300
HURTLING TOWARDS THE

17:15.367 --> 17:16.567
EVER-INCREASING POSSIBILITY OF

17:16.633 --> 17:17.900
LEAVING NEXT MONTH WITH NO DEAL

17:17.967 --> 17:22.333
IN PLACE AT ALL.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.734
SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS NO

17:23.767 --> 17:26.100
DEAL?

17:26.166 --> 17:27.800
WELL, FIRST -- IRONICALLY --

17:27.867 --> 17:29.633
THERE WILL BE A HARD BORDER IN

17:29.700 --> 17:30.467
IRELAND, THE ONE THING THAT

17:30.533 --> 17:34.333
EVERYONE AGREES THEY DON'T WANT.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.100
BUT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD GO

17:35.166 --> 17:36.166
MUCH FURTHER THAN THAT, BECAUSE

17:36.233 --> 17:37.500
IT WON'T JUST BE THE IRISH

17:37.567 --> 17:40.333
BORDER WHERE THERE'LL BE CUSTOMS

17:40.400 --> 17:42.867
CHECKS.

17:42.934 --> 17:43.533
BRAND-NEW SCREENINGS WILL BE

17:43.600 --> 17:44.734
REQUIRED AT EVERY POINT OF

17:44.800 --> 17:45.300
ENTRY, AND AT MAJOR BRITISH

17:45.367 --> 17:45.967
PORTS LIKE DOVER, WHERE TRUCKS

17:46.033 --> 17:46.834
ARRIVE ON FERRIES, THAT COULD

17:46.900 --> 17:47.834
MEAN CHAOS.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.533
>> UNDER A NO-DEAL BREXIT,

17:48.600 --> 17:49.266
WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION RULES

17:49.333 --> 17:50.567
WOULD KICK IN OVERNIGHT, MEANING

17:50.633 --> 17:51.166
CUSTOMS INSPECTIONS ON EVERY

17:51.233 --> 17:56.166
VEHICLE.

17:56.233 --> 17:56.900
BY ONE ESTIMATE, IF CUSTOMS

17:56.967 --> 17:57.934
DELAYED EACH TRUCK BY JUST

17:58.000 --> 17:58.900
70 ADDITIONAL SECONDS, THE WAIT

17:58.967 --> 17:59.900
TO BOARD THE FERRY COULD REACH

17:59.967 --> 18:00.734
SIX DAYS.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.767
>> John: YEAH, THAT IS A MASSIVE

18:02.834 --> 18:04.567
PROBLEM, BECAUSE THE WHOLE

18:04.633 --> 18:06.367
SYSTEM IS BUILT ON SEAMLESS

18:06.433 --> 18:11.834
MOVEMENT.

18:11.900 --> 18:12.633
INTRODUCE ANY HITCH INTO THAT

18:12.700 --> 18:13.333
SYSTEM, AND IT ALL BREAKS DOWN.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.500
IT'S LIKE BEING IN A SUPERMARKET

18:14.567 --> 18:15.133
CHECKOUT WHEN ONE PERSON BRINGS

18:15.200 --> 18:15.700
A FRUIT THE CASHIER DOESN'T

18:15.767 --> 18:16.166
KNOW.

18:16.233 --> 18:17.066
HOLD ON A SECOND.

18:17.133 --> 18:18.700
YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO BUY A

18:18.734 --> 18:19.800
DRAGONFRUIT AT A KROGER AT

18:19.867 --> 18:21.400
6:00 PM ON A RAINY SUNDAY.

18:21.467 --> 18:27.900
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

18:27.967 --> 18:28.967
YOU DROP THAT FRUIT!

18:29.033 --> 18:32.633
YOU DROP THAT FRUIT!

18:32.700 --> 18:33.166
YOU DROP IT AND WALK AWAY!

18:33.233 --> 18:34.133
NOT UP IN HERE!

18:34.200 --> 18:34.767
NOT UP IN HERE!

18:34.834 --> 18:36.066
AND PERISHABLE GOODS WILL BE

18:36.133 --> 18:36.700
PARTICULARLY HARD-HIT BY DELAYS

18:36.767 --> 18:37.200
AT PORTS, AS THIS FLOWER

18:37.266 --> 18:37.934
IMPORTER WILL TELL YOU.

18:38.000 --> 18:38.934
>> IF THINGS GET DELAYED, OUR

18:39.000 --> 18:40.233
SHIPPING GETS DELAYED, AND WE'RE

18:40.300 --> 18:41.900
TRADING WITH NO -- NO FLOWERS.

18:41.967 --> 18:43.900
SO WE -- WE NEED FREE MOVEMENTS

18:43.967 --> 18:45.834
AND IT WILL AFFECT US.

18:45.900 --> 18:46.934
>> WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR YOU IF WE

18:47.000 --> 18:47.934
DON'T GET THIS RIGHT NOW?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.467
>> EVERYTHING.

18:49.533 --> 18:50.867
MY FAMILY, MY HOUSE, EVERYTHING,

18:50.934 --> 18:53.767
MY STAFF.

18:53.834 --> 18:54.400
YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN TRADING FOR

18:54.467 --> 18:54.767
33 YEARS.

18:54.834 --> 18:55.533
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S VERY SAD

18:55.600 --> 18:56.900
BECAUSE PEOPLE DO TEND TO WANT

18:56.967 --> 18:59.066
FLOWERS NOW AND ALIVE.

18:59.133 --> 19:01.200
ALTHOUGH YOU MAY FEEL SLIGHTLY

19:01.266 --> 19:03.200
LESS SORRY FOR THAT MAN WHEN YOU

19:03.266 --> 19:04.567
HEAR WHAT HE SAID NEXT.

19:04.633 --> 19:05.834
>> YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN TRADING

19:05.900 --> 19:07.133
FOR 33 YEARS.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.533
AND I DID VOTE TO LEAVE.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.400
>> DO YOU REGRET THAT?

19:10.467 --> 19:11.834
>> I DEFINITELY HAVE SECOND

19:11.867 --> 19:14.467
THOUGHTS NOW, BUT --

19:14.500 --> 19:15.800
>> BUT WHEN YOU VOTED "LEAVE,"

19:15.867 --> 19:18.600
DID YOU NOT THINK, "WELL, THIS

19:18.667 --> 19:19.533
IS GONNA AFFECT MY FLOWERS?"

19:19.600 --> 19:20.800
>> I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT

19:20.867 --> 19:21.667
IT LIKE THAT.

19:21.734 --> 19:22.533
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT THE

19:22.600 --> 19:23.500
BUSINESS SIDE OF IT.

19:23.567 --> 19:24.233
>> John: YEAH, WELL, YOU

19:24.300 --> 19:25.066
PROBABLY SHOULD'VE DONE,

19:25.133 --> 19:26.333
SHOULDN'T YOU?

19:26.400 --> 19:27.533
AND NOW, YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH

19:27.600 --> 19:29.533
FUCKED YOURSELF WITH A RUSTY

19:29.600 --> 19:30.333
PIECE OF REBAR.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.600
WHICH ISN'T OFFENSIVE, IT'S

19:31.667 --> 19:32.567
SOMETHING I SAW ON A MUG, SO

19:32.633 --> 19:34.300
IT'S FINE.

19:34.367 --> 19:41.200
THE MUG MAKES IT OKAY, MARY.

19:41.266 --> 19:44.200
YOU TRUST A MUG ALWAYS.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.600
NOW, LOOK, THE CHILLING PROSPECT

19:45.667 --> 19:47.033
OF A NO-DEAL BREXIT HAS NOW

19:47.100 --> 19:47.700
BECOME LIKELY ENOUGH THAT THE

19:47.767 --> 19:48.734
GOVERNMENT HAS RELEASED OVER A

19:48.800 --> 19:49.400
HUNDRED GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS

19:49.467 --> 19:54.667
INSTRUCTING PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT TO

19:54.734 --> 19:55.333
DO IF IT DOES HAPPEN, EVERYTHING

19:55.400 --> 19:55.900
FROM HOW PESTICIDES WILL BE

19:55.967 --> 19:56.567
REGULATED TO WHAT THE NEW

19:56.633 --> 19:57.266
PROCEDURES WOULD BE FOR TAKING

19:57.333 --> 19:58.266
YOUR HORSE ABROAD.

19:58.333 --> 19:58.900
ALTHOUGH I THINK I CAN ACTUALLY

19:58.967 --> 19:59.467
SOLVE THAT ONE FOR YOU RIGHT

19:59.533 --> 20:00.333
NOW: TAKE OFF ITS SHOES, PUT IT

20:00.400 --> 20:01.467
IN A SEPARATE TRAY, AND LOOK

20:01.533 --> 20:02.433
INNOCENTLY CONFUSED WHEN AIRPORT

20:02.500 --> 20:03.734
SECURITY STARTS ASKING WHOSE

20:03.800 --> 20:08.633
FUCKING HORSE THIS IS.

20:08.700 --> 20:09.667
AND WHILE SOME OF WHAT WILL

20:09.734 --> 20:11.033
HAPPEN IN A NO-DEAL SCENARIO MAY

20:11.100 --> 20:12.000
GO INTO THE CATEGORY OF

20:12.066 --> 20:13.333
"MANAGEABLE ANNOYANCE," THERE

20:13.400 --> 20:14.700
ARE SOME GENUINELY ALARMING

20:14.767 --> 20:16.066
ISSUES LIKE, WILL THERE BE A

20:16.133 --> 20:17.300
SHORTAGE OF MEDICATION THAT

20:17.367 --> 20:18.700
COMES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES THAT

20:18.767 --> 20:19.734
COULD AFFECT SOMEONE LIKE THIS

20:19.800 --> 20:20.767
GIRL WITH CEREBRAL PALSY AND

20:20.834 --> 20:22.266
EPILEPSY?

20:22.333 --> 20:23.333
>> SHE HAS THREE DRUGS THAT SHE

20:23.400 --> 20:24.834
HAS THAT ARE CRITICAL, AND

20:24.900 --> 20:26.367
WITHOUT THEM, SHE WILL HAVE

20:26.433 --> 20:28.667
MULTIPLE SEIZURES IN A DAY.

20:28.734 --> 20:30.333
IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST

20:30.400 --> 20:31.734
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD,

20:31.800 --> 20:33.567
FINANCIALLY, AND I'M SITTING

20:33.633 --> 20:34.633
HERE THINKING, "WILL I BE ABLE

20:34.700 --> 20:35.533
TO GET MEDICINE IN TWO MONTHS'

20:35.600 --> 20:40.433
TIME?"

20:40.500 --> 20:41.533
IT'S A COMPLETELY CRAZY

20:41.600 --> 20:46.767
SITUATION.

20:46.834 --> 20:48.033
>> John: YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT

20:48.100 --> 20:49.433
THAT, BECAUSE MEDICINE SHORTAGES

20:49.500 --> 20:50.600
ARE NOT A PROBLEM THAT BRITONS

20:50.667 --> 20:51.033
EXPECT TO DEAL WITH.

20:51.100 --> 20:51.633
THEY'RE USED TO HAVING THEIR

20:51.700 --> 20:52.567
PROBLEMS LIMITED TO HEARING

20:52.633 --> 20:53.200
AMERICANS MISPRONOUNCE THE WORD

20:53.266 --> 20:54.133
"VITAMIN."

20:54.200 --> 20:55.300
NOT HAVING ENOUGH BEANS AS PART

20:55.367 --> 20:56.066
OF YOUR BREAKFAST, AND HAVING TO

20:56.133 --> 20:56.967
WAIT 20 YEARS FOR ANOTHER ROYAL

20:57.033 --> 20:57.800
WEDDING.

20:57.867 --> 20:58.567
HOW ARE YOU STILL SINGLE,

20:58.633 --> 20:59.834
GEORGE?

20:59.900 --> 21:00.967
SETTLE DOWN ALREADY, YOU'RE THIS

21:01.033 --> 21:02.500
MANY.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.900
FIND A FIANCEE FOR US TO

21:03.967 --> 21:07.000
FEROCIOUSLY JUDGE.

21:07.066 --> 21:07.800
AND IF ALL OF THIS IS NOT

21:07.867 --> 21:09.300
ALREADY FRIGHTENING ENOUGH,

21:09.367 --> 21:10.567
THERE ARE WARNINGS OF EMPTY

21:10.633 --> 21:13.567
SHELVES, AND SOME BRITONS HAVE

21:13.633 --> 21:14.934
BEGUN STOCKPILING FOOD OR BUYING

21:15.000 --> 21:16.233
SO-CALLED "BREXIT BOXES," WHICH,

21:16.300 --> 21:17.734
WHEN YOU SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY

21:17.800 --> 21:22.700
INSIDE THEM, SEEMS PRETTY GRIM.

21:22.767 --> 21:23.567
>> THEY MAY LOOK LIKE TINS OF

21:23.633 --> 21:25.000
PAINT, BUT THEY COULD BE DINNER

21:25.066 --> 21:26.900
A LA BREXIT.

21:26.967 --> 21:28.033
EVERY BREXIT BOX CONTAINS ALL

21:28.100 --> 21:29.367
YOU NEED TO WHIP UP FAMILY

21:29.433 --> 21:30.800
FAVORITES LIKE CHILI CON CARNE,

21:30.867 --> 21:33.934
CHICKEN TIKKA, AND EVEN FAJITAS.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.700
>> John: NOW, PUTTING ASIDE HOW

21:35.767 --> 21:37.166
UNAPPETIZING A PAINT CAN OF WET

21:37.233 --> 21:38.734
MEAT SOUNDS, LET'S ALSO NOT

21:38.800 --> 21:40.433
OVERLOOK THE METAPHORICAL

21:40.500 --> 21:41.767
SIGNIFICANCE OF EVERY DISH IN

21:41.834 --> 21:43.100
THE BREXIT BOX BEING SOMETHING

21:43.166 --> 21:44.300
THAT CAME TO BRITAIN FROM

21:44.367 --> 21:45.500
ANOTHER COUNTRY AND GREATLY

21:45.567 --> 21:46.667
IMPROVED THE LIVES OF EVERYONE

21:46.734 --> 21:48.233
THERE.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.233
NOW, THINGS LOOK DIRE HERE.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.333
UNDER ANY FORM OF BREXIT,

21:52.400 --> 21:53.467
BRITAIN'S ECONOMIC OPTIONS ARE

21:53.533 --> 21:55.467
BASICALLY "BAD" AND "WORSE."

21:55.533 --> 21:56.667
THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN ANALYSIS

21:56.734 --> 21:57.867
SUGGESTS THAT, UNDER A BREXIT

21:57.934 --> 21:59.467
LIKE THERESA MAY'S PLAN, THE UK

21:59.533 --> 22:01.533
ECONOMY COULD BE UP TO 3.9%

22:01.600 --> 22:03.100
SMALLER AFTER 15 YEARS.

22:03.166 --> 22:05.633
WHICH SOUNDS BAD UNTIL YOU LEARN

22:05.700 --> 22:07.367
THAT UNDER A NO-DEAL BREXIT,

22:07.433 --> 22:09.033
WE'RE LOOKING AT AN ECONOMY AS

22:09.100 --> 22:11.166
MUCH AS 9.3% SMALLER.

22:11.233 --> 22:12.233
AND A SLOWDOWN LIKE THAT WOULD

22:12.300 --> 22:13.500
NOT JUST HURT BRITAIN -- IT

22:13.567 --> 22:14.867
WOULD RIPPLE ACROSS THE WHOLE

22:14.934 --> 22:25.233
WORLD.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.000
AND YET, INCREDIBLY, SOME IN

22:26.066 --> 22:26.767
BRITAIN REMAIN COMPLETELY

22:26.834 --> 22:27.633
UNFAZED BY ALL THIS, DRAWING

22:27.700 --> 22:28.400
CONFIDENCE FROM THE WORST

22:28.467 --> 22:29.333
POSSIBLE EXAMPLES.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.066
>> I LOST A GRANDFATHER IN THE

22:30.133 --> 22:31.300
FIRST WORLD WAR, I LOST AN UNCLE

22:31.367 --> 22:31.934
IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND WE

22:32.000 --> 22:32.700
SURVIVED.

22:32.767 --> 22:33.600
>> ARE YOU NOT A LITTLE BIT

22:33.667 --> 22:34.700
CONCERNED THAT WE'RE TALKING

22:34.767 --> 22:35.500
ABOUT THIS POLITICAL EVENT THE

22:35.567 --> 22:37.000
SAME WAY THAT WE'RE TALKING

22:37.066 --> 22:37.734
ABOUT THE AFTERMATH OF

22:37.800 --> 22:39.367
WORLD WARS?

22:39.433 --> 22:40.500
>> NO, I'M NOT.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.467
I THINK IT'S THE SAME SORT OF

22:41.533 --> 22:42.567
SITUATION.

22:42.633 --> 22:43.800
>> John: BUT IT ISN'T, THOUGH,

22:43.867 --> 22:44.333
IS IT?

22:44.400 --> 22:45.100
BECAUSE THE WORLD WARS WERE

22:45.166 --> 22:46.033
PROVOKED.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.400
THEY WERE A RESPONSE TO OUTSIDE

22:47.467 --> 22:48.033
EVENTS.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.367
BREXIT IS SOMETHING BRITAIN'S

22:49.433 --> 22:53.700
DONE TO ITSELF.

22:53.767 --> 22:54.433
BRITAIN IS BASICALLY POMPEII IF

22:54.500 --> 22:55.600
POMPEII HAD VOTED FOR THE

22:55.667 --> 22:56.600
VOLCANO.

22:56.667 --> 22:57.700
"A BUS SAID THE VOLCANO WOULD BE

22:57.767 --> 22:58.467
GOOD!

22:58.533 --> 22:59.533
I BELIEVE THE BUS!

22:59.600 --> 23:01.467
AND A MUG BACKED IT UP!

23:01.533 --> 23:05.667
YOU TRUST MUGS!"

23:05.734 --> 23:06.934
AND THIS BRINGS US TO THE FINAL

23:07.000 --> 23:07.500
QUESTION HERE.

23:07.567 --> 23:08.567
IF ALL OF THIS GOING TO BE SO

23:08.633 --> 23:09.467
BAD, COULD BRITAIN JUST NOT DO

23:09.533 --> 23:10.300
THIS?

23:10.367 --> 23:11.433
TO WHICH THE ANSWER IS,

23:11.500 --> 23:13.033
TECHNICALLY, YES.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.066
IN DECEMBER, THE EUROPEAN COURT

23:14.133 --> 23:15.367
OF JUSTICE RULED THAT THE UK CAN

23:15.433 --> 23:17.100
SIMPLY REVOKE ITS INTENTION TO

23:17.166 --> 23:18.300
WITHDRAW.

23:18.367 --> 23:19.233
THAT IS A BIG INDICATION THAT

23:19.300 --> 23:21.500
EUROPE WOULD TAKE US BACK.

23:21.567 --> 23:25.367
AND AN EVEN BIGGER INDICATION IS

23:25.433 --> 23:26.233
THE EXISTENCE OF THE

23:26.300 --> 23:27.700
BREUNION BOYS, A DUTCH GROUP WHO

23:27.767 --> 23:29.433
DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS A

23:29.500 --> 23:30.667
"BOY BAND DRIVEN TO RE-UNITE

23:30.734 --> 23:33.633
GREAT BRITAIN WITH THE EU."

23:33.700 --> 23:34.767
AND IF YOU THINK THEY DIDN'T

23:34.834 --> 23:35.834
MAKE A MUSIC VIDEO, YOU CLEARLY

23:35.900 --> 23:37.033
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I'M

24:46.333 --> 24:47.934
YOU REALLY THINK BRITISH PEOPLE

24:48.000 --> 24:48.500
ARE GOING TO BE IMPRESSED BY

24:48.567 --> 24:49.500
YOUR ABS?

24:49.567 --> 24:51.000
WE'RE BRITISH.

24:51.066 --> 24:53.100
IF THERE'S ONE THING PEOPLE KNOW

24:53.166 --> 24:54.133
ABOUT US, IT'S THAT WE ALL HAVE

24:54.200 --> 24:55.433
SPECTACULAR ABS.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.467
LOOK, MINE ARE OBVIOUSLY

24:56.533 --> 24:57.934
AMAZING.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.500
THE QUEEN'S ARE COMPLETELY

24:59.567 --> 25:01.133
INSANE.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.433
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR

25:02.500 --> 25:03.433
LITTLE EUROZONE FOUR-PACK AND

25:03.500 --> 25:06.066
HIT THE GYM, PENCIL-NECK.

25:06.133 --> 25:08.233
AND WHILE, CLEARLY, THAT BAND IS

25:08.300 --> 25:09.734
A PRETTY SOLID ARGUMENT FOR

25:09.800 --> 25:11.500
LEAVING THE EU ON ANY TERMS

25:11.567 --> 25:13.467
NECESSARY, WHAT IF BRITAIN DID

25:13.533 --> 25:14.734
WANT TO STAY?

25:14.800 --> 25:16.367
HOW WOULD THAT EVEN HAPPEN?

25:16.433 --> 25:17.700
WELL, THERESA MAY AND PARLIAMENT

25:17.767 --> 25:19.166
COULD WEIGH THE EVIDENCE AND

25:19.233 --> 25:20.367
DECIDE THAT BREXIT IS NOT WORTH

25:20.433 --> 25:21.166
IT.

25:21.233 --> 25:22.200
THAT WOULD BE THE TRULY

25:22.266 --> 25:23.700
COURAGEOUS THING TO DO.

25:23.767 --> 25:24.567
THEY WON'T DO IT BECAUSE OF THE

25:24.633 --> 25:26.000
POLITICAL BACKLASH THEY'D GET

25:26.066 --> 25:27.266
FOR DEFYING THE POPULAR WILL.

25:27.333 --> 25:29.133
BUT THAT IS WHY SOME HAVE

25:29.200 --> 25:32.734
SUGGESTED A SECOND REFERENDUM.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.700
NOW, THAT WOULD NOT BE EASY.

25:33.767 --> 25:38.300
FIRST, THE SHORTEST ESTIMATE OF

25:38.367 --> 25:39.734
THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO

25:39.800 --> 25:41.133
ORGANIZE A VOTE IS 22 WEEKS, AND

25:41.200 --> 25:41.900
THERE'S JUST SIX WEEKS LEFT.

25:41.967 --> 25:42.567
AND ALSO, WHAT, EXACTLY, WOULD

25:42.633 --> 25:43.600
PEOPLE VOTE ON?

25:43.667 --> 25:44.433
WOULD IT BE REMAIN IN THE EU

25:44.500 --> 25:45.900
VERSUS THERESA MAY'S BREXIT?

25:45.967 --> 25:47.200
OR REMAIN VERSUS THE NO-DEAL

25:47.266 --> 25:49.166
BREXIT?

25:49.233 --> 25:50.233
OR DO YOU PUT ALL THREE OPTIONS

25:50.300 --> 25:51.667
ON THE BALLOT, PROBABLY SPLIT

25:51.734 --> 25:52.800
THE VOTE, FAIL TO GET A CLEAR

25:52.867 --> 25:53.867
MAJORITY FOR ANY OPTION, AND

25:53.934 --> 25:55.266
SOMEHOW MAKE THIS WHOLE MESS

25:55.333 --> 25:56.900
EVEN WORSE?

25:56.967 --> 25:58.200
BECAUSE THE REALITY IS, THIS

25:58.266 --> 26:02.433
SITUATION IS FAR TOO COMPLEX FOR

26:02.500 --> 26:05.667
AN UP-OR-DOWN REFERENDUM, WHICH,

26:05.734 --> 26:08.967
BY THE WAY, WAS ALSO TRUE OF THE

26:09.033 --> 26:10.567
FIRST FUCKING ONE, BECAUSE WHEN

26:10.633 --> 26:13.300
VOTERS WERE JUST ASKED TO LEAVE

26:13.367 --> 26:15.133
OR STAY WITHOUT A SENSE OF WHAT

26:15.200 --> 26:15.667
THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY MEAN.

26:15.734 --> 26:16.333
THE FIRST REFERENDUM WAS A

26:16.400 --> 26:17.266
TERRIBLE IDEA, BECAUSE IT WAS

26:17.333 --> 26:17.967
THE GOVERNMENT PUNTING A

26:18.033 --> 26:18.700
DIFFICULT DECISION TO THE

26:18.767 --> 26:19.533
PEOPLE, WHICH, IN THE PEOPLE'S

26:19.600 --> 26:21.133
DEFENSE, IS NOT THEIR JOB.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.133
THEY ELECT POLITICIANS TO MAKE

26:22.200 --> 26:24.667
REASONED, FACT-BASED DECISIONS

26:24.734 --> 26:26.266
ON THEIR BEHALF.

26:26.333 --> 26:27.600
THAT'S HOW REPRESENTATIVE

26:27.667 --> 26:29.033
DEMOCRACY WORKS.

26:29.133 --> 26:30.166
AND YOU KNOW WHO COULD'VE TOLD

26:30.233 --> 26:32.367
YOU ALL OF THIS AT THE TIME?

26:32.433 --> 26:34.900
THE PEOPLE OF "GOGGLEBOX."

26:34.967 --> 26:35.934
JUST WATCH THEM REACT TO THE

26:36.000 --> 26:37.667
REFERENDUM BEING ANNOUNCED IN

26:37.734 --> 26:39.300
2016.

26:39.367 --> 26:40.467
>> DO YOU THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS

26:40.533 --> 26:42.800
ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO VOTE?

26:42.867 --> 26:44.800
I KNOW THERE MUST BE OTHER

26:44.867 --> 26:46.367
PEOPLE LIKE ME.

26:46.433 --> 26:50.166
>> THIS IS WHAT'S WORRYING ME.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.133
I'M WORRIED THAT PEOPLE AREN'T

26:52.200 --> 26:53.367
WELL-INFORMED ENOUGH TO MAKE THE

26:53.433 --> 26:55.166
DECISION.

26:55.233 --> 26:56.467
>> IT'S SUCH A BIG DECISION.

26:56.533 --> 27:00.000
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

27:00.066 --> 27:00.834
AND THEN I DON'T WANT TO VOTE ON

27:00.900 --> 27:01.633
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T REALLY

27:01.700 --> 27:02.333
TRULY UNDERSTAND.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.100
>> John: RIGHT.

27:03.166 --> 27:04.066
THAT IS AN INTELLIGENT THING TO

27:04.133 --> 27:05.066
SAY.

27:05.133 --> 27:06.200
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW STUFF,

27:06.266 --> 27:07.266
SO YOU HIRE SOMEONE ELSE TO KNOW

27:07.333 --> 27:09.400
IT FOR YOU.

27:09.467 --> 27:11.300
IF YOU CAME TO YOUR DOCTOR WITH

27:11.367 --> 27:12.533
STOMACH PAIN, AND HE SAID,

27:12.600 --> 27:14.433
"WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

27:14.500 --> 27:15.633
SHOULD YOUR APPENDIX LEAVE OR

27:15.700 --> 27:16.433
REMAIN?"

27:16.500 --> 27:17.133
YOU'D PROBABLY SAY, "DON'T ASK

27:17.200 --> 27:17.967
ME.

27:18.033 --> 27:21.200
DO YOUR FUCKING JOB!"

27:21.266 --> 27:22.967
LOOK, A TRUE ACT OF POLITICAL

27:23.033 --> 27:24.700
COURAGE AT THIS POINT WOULDN'T

27:24.767 --> 27:26.166
BE TO CALL FOR A SECOND

27:26.233 --> 27:30.934
REFERENDUM -- SOMETHING

27:31.000 --> 27:32.233
THAT THERESA MAY'S ALREADY SAID

27:32.300 --> 27:32.834
SHE WON'T DO.

27:32.900 --> 27:33.633
IT WOULD BE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

27:33.700 --> 27:34.367
THE FIRST ONE WAS FATALLY FLAWED

27:34.433 --> 27:35.333
AND THAT CARRYING IT OUT WILL DO

27:35.400 --> 27:36.133
LONG-TERM DAMAGE TO THE COUNTRY

27:36.200 --> 27:36.900
AND THEN CANCELING BREXIT

27:36.967 --> 27:38.000
ALTOGETHER.

27:38.066 --> 27:39.400
BUT IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS NO

27:39.467 --> 27:42.100
WAY THAT'S HAPPENING.

27:42.166 --> 27:43.433
INSTEAD, BRITAIN SEEMS

27:43.500 --> 27:44.900
DETERMINED TO STEP FIRMLY DOWN

27:44.967 --> 27:46.100
UPON THE RAKE OF HISTORY AND

27:46.166 --> 27:48.200
SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.

27:48.266 --> 27:50.633
AND I WISH I COULD OFFER YOU A

27:50.700 --> 27:52.066
ROUSING, CHURCHILLIAN SPEECH NOW

27:52.133 --> 27:53.333
ABOUT HOW EVERYTHING'S GOING TO

27:53.400 --> 27:55.233
BE OKAY, BUT UNDER THE

27:55.300 --> 27:57.100
CIRCUMSTANCES, HONESTLY, THE

27:57.166 --> 28:01.767
BEST I CAN OFFER YOU IS THIS.

28:01.834 --> 28:04.100
>> PEOPLE OF BRITAIN, THROUGHOUT

28:04.166 --> 28:05.867
HISTORY, WE'VE FACED OUR SHARE

28:05.934 --> 28:07.200
OF DARK HOURS.

28:07.266 --> 28:08.467
THE GREAT WAR.

28:08.533 --> 28:09.967
THE BLITZ.

28:10.033 --> 28:11.500
AND THAT TIME WHEN DEBORAH

28:11.567 --> 28:13.800
ACCIDENTALLY USED HOWARD'S

28:13.867 --> 28:15.500
CUSTARD IN HER OWN TRIFLE.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.500
>> THAT'S MY CUSTARD.

28:16.533 --> 28:18.333
>> OH, NO.

28:18.367 --> 28:21.667
SO SORRY, HOWARD.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.100
>> AND THROUGH ALL THIS, OUR

28:23.166 --> 28:24.700
STIFF UPPER LIP HAS PREVAILED,

28:24.767 --> 28:26.266
BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY IS NOT FOR

28:26.333 --> 28:27.367
TURNING, NOT WHEN OTHER

28:27.433 --> 28:31.200
COUNTRIES HAVE TRIED TO DESTROY

28:31.266 --> 28:32.934
US AND NOT WHEN WE ARE IN THE

28:33.000 --> 28:33.567
MIDST OF TRYING TO DESTROY

28:33.633 --> 28:34.767
OURSELVES.

28:34.834 --> 28:35.667
AND I KNOW SOME ARE YELLING,

28:35.734 --> 28:36.867
BRITAIN, COME BACK, DON'T DO

28:36.934 --> 28:37.800
THIS!

28:37.867 --> 28:39.667
YOU'RE POINTLESSLY FUCKING

28:39.734 --> 28:42.533
YOURSELVES!

28:42.600 --> 28:44.800
AND TO THEM, WE SAY, OH, WE HAVE

28:44.867 --> 28:46.333
NOT EVEN BEGUN TO FUCK

28:46.400 --> 28:49.166
OURSELVES.

28:49.233 --> 28:50.800
WE SHALL FUCK OURSELVES AT THE

28:50.867 --> 28:51.900
PORTS.

28:51.967 --> 28:53.066
WE SHALL FUCK OURSELVES AT THE

28:53.133 --> 28:57.934
SHOPS.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.066
WE SHALL FUCK OURSELVES IN THE

28:59.133 --> 29:00.233
HOSPITALS AND IN THE FIELDS.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.300
WE SHALL NEVER SURRENDER.

29:02.367 --> 29:03.767
AND WHEN THE DUST CLEARS, WHAT

29:03.834 --> 29:05.934
WILL REMAIN?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.367
BRITAIN.

29:07.433 --> 29:08.500
NOT THE SAME BRITAIN, CERTAINLY.

29:08.567 --> 29:10.133
A WORSE ONE WITH A WEAKER

29:10.200 --> 29:12.533
ECONOMY.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.700
POSSIBLY NO FRESH FRUIT AND A

29:13.767 --> 29:15.433
GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION OVER HOW

29:15.500 --> 29:16.533
HORSES CAN GO ON HOLIDAY.

29:17.667 --> 29:21.734
BUT BRITAIN NONETHELESS.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.166
AND ONCE WE HAVE DELIVERED THIS

29:24.233 --> 29:26.734
MORTAL WOUND TO OURSELVES, WE

29:26.800 --> 29:28.767
WILL SAVOR THE TASTE OF VICTORY,

29:28.834 --> 29:31.633
A VICTORY THAT TASTES LIKE

29:31.700 --> 29:33.333
MUMMIFIED CHICKEN FAJITAS!

29:37.834 --> 29:42.734
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW,

29:42.800 --> 29:43.600
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

29:43.667 --> 29:45.133
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK, GOOD NIGHT!
