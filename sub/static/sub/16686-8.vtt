<i>- The Brooklyn Bridge was</i>
<i>complete, and Emily Roebling</i>

00:05.806 --> 00:08.474
<i>was like, I built the [bleep]</i>
<i>out this bridge.</i>

00:08.476 --> 00:10.209
I'm so drunk.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.378
<i>- Victor goes at the</i>
<i>Eiffel Tower, and he's like,</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.713
<i>we're tearing this bitch down.</i>

00:14.715 --> 00:16.215
[laughs]

00:16.217 --> 00:19.284
<i>- Shakespeare is like,</i>
<i>this building belongs to us,</i>

00:19.286 --> 00:21.253
<i>and we're going to take it.</i>

00:21.255 --> 00:23.055
What are we talking about?

00:23.057 --> 00:26.225
<i>[patriotic music]</i>

00:26.227 --> 00:33.365
<i>♪ ♪</i>

00:35.535 --> 00:37.836
<i>- We are going to get tipsy.</i>

00:37.838 --> 00:39.505
- Tipsy?
- No, we gonna get drunk.

00:39.507 --> 00:40.773
- Okay, good.
- You know I like to

00:40.775 --> 00:41.607
make mixed drinks for you.

00:41.609 --> 00:44.243
- Yeah, what are we gonna have?
- We're gonna do Brooklyns.

00:44.245 --> 00:48.514
We got rye whiskey,
dry vermouth, cherry liqueur.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.515
- How do you measure that?

00:49.517 --> 00:52.251
- No, don't worry about that.
[ice clinking]

00:52.253 --> 00:53.385
- Cheers to the Brooklyn--

00:53.387 --> 00:55.187
- To the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.289
Ooh.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.690
How's that taste?

00:59.826 --> 01:03.228
[laughs]

01:05.365 --> 01:10.369
Hello, I'm Daryl Johnson,
and today, we're gonna talk

01:10.371 --> 01:11.870
about the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:11.872 --> 01:17.476
<i>It's Brooklyn, 1865,</i>
<i>and it's becoming this</i>

01:17.478 --> 01:18.444
<i>really emerging town.</i>

01:18.446 --> 01:21.480
<i>The ferries are going back and</i>
<i>forth to Manhattan, and they</i>

01:21.482 --> 01:24.783
<i>couldn't handle the load, uh,</i>
<i>so a committee was formed</i>

01:24.785 --> 01:28.253
<i>in New York called</i>
<i>The New York Bridge Committee,</i>

01:28.255 --> 01:31.156
<i>and they're just like,</i>
<i>this [bleep] is not working.</i>

01:31.158 --> 01:32.558
<i>These ferries are [bleep] up,</i>

01:32.560 --> 01:34.827
and they decided that they
needed to have a bridge built.

01:34.829 --> 01:40.199
<i>This is going to be</i>
<i>the largest bridge ever built.</i>

01:40.201 --> 01:41.200
<i>- In the world?</i>

01:41.202 --> 01:41.767
<i>- In the world.</i>

01:41.769 --> 01:45.571
<i>And so the New York Committee</i>
<i>hired John Roebling</i>

01:45.573 --> 01:48.273
to design and build
the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.375
<i>Now, he wanted to build</i>
<i>a suspension bridge.</i>

01:50.377 --> 01:53.278
<i>There were a lot of naysayers</i>
<i>saying that suspension bridges,</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:55.380
<i>oh they fall,</i>
<i>they can't hold,</i>

01:55.382 --> 01:57.282
<i>there can never be one</i>
<i>that big.</i>

01:57.284 --> 01:58.450
So most suspension bridges
at the time were made

01:58.452 --> 02:05.190
with hemp ropes,
but he developed wire ropes.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.759
<i>And so, John Roebling</i>
<i>is the man.</i>

02:07.761 --> 02:12.264
<i>Everybody is very excited to</i>
<i>see what this is gonna become.</i>

02:12.266 --> 02:14.633
You look like
two of you right now.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.602
[laughter]

02:16.604 --> 02:19.371
Let me get this cherry
out of here.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.375
- You ate the stem?

02:23.377 --> 02:25.577
- There's no stems.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.712
Was there a stem?

02:26.714 --> 02:28.347
- [laughs]

02:28.349 --> 02:32.751
- So, Washington Roebling, who
was the son of John Roebling,

02:32.753 --> 02:36.922
<i>was this huge Civil War hero.</i>
<i>And while he was finishing up</i>

02:36.924 --> 02:38.857
<i>his duties in the war,</i>
<i>he met Emily Warren.</i>

02:38.859 --> 02:43.962
<i>When Washington saw Emily for</i>
<i>the first time, he was like,</i>

02:43.964 --> 02:46.765
<i>you are the most beautiful</i>
<i>woman I've ever seen</i>

02:46.767 --> 02:47.766
<i>in my life.</i>

02:47.768 --> 02:49.201
<i>And she was like...</i>
<i>[giggles]</i>

02:49.203 --> 02:51.236
<i>Thank you, that's so cute,</i>
<i>oh, my God.</i>

02:51.238 --> 02:55.574
<i>And they got married, and</i>
<i>Washington calls his dad</i>

02:55.576 --> 02:58.644
<i>and was like, hey, I met this</i>
<i>beautiful woman, I got married.</i>

02:58.646 --> 03:01.980
<i>And he was like, great, son.</i>
<i>I need you to come to Brooklyn</i>

03:01.982 --> 03:04.516
<i>and help me build this bridge.</i>

03:04.518 --> 03:07.252
<i>And so they fly to Brooklyn,</i>
<i>and they--</i>

03:07.254 --> 03:08.453
wait, no, they didn't fly.
I take that back.

03:08.455 --> 03:13.392
[laughs]
There was no planes in 1865.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.662
Okay, so, they moved
to Brooklyn,

03:16.664 --> 03:20.399
and two years into the process,
John Roebling got lockjaw

03:20.401 --> 03:23.702
from tetanus.
So he says to his son...

03:23.704 --> 03:25.871
<i>[muffled voice]</i>
<i>Son, I can't open my mouth,</i>

03:25.873 --> 03:29.541
<i>but what I need you to do is</i>
<i>take over this bridge for me</i>

03:29.543 --> 03:32.377
<i>because I'm 'bout to die,</i>
<i>and this is my legacy,</i>

03:32.379 --> 03:35.547
<i>and I'm passing it to you,</i>
<i>so don't [bleep] this up.</i>

03:35.549 --> 03:35.981
And so...

03:35.983 --> 03:40.352
<i>Washington's freaking out, and</i>
<i>it was Emily who stepped in,</i>

03:40.354 --> 03:42.421
<i>and she said, baby, I love you.</i>

03:42.423 --> 03:44.423
<i>You can do this.</i>
<i>You're the man.</i>

03:44.425 --> 03:48.961
<i>And Washington Roebling was</i>
<i>like, yeah, you got my back.</i>

03:48.963 --> 03:49.861
<i>We can do this.</i>

03:49.863 --> 03:52.531
So he developed these
pneumatic caissons, which were

03:52.533 --> 03:55.367
<i>these huge, wooden boxes.</i>

03:55.369 --> 03:58.837
And they blew in compressed
air, and then they had to put

03:58.839 --> 04:02.374
<i>people down there</i>
<i>to dig out the river bed.</i>

04:02.376 --> 04:07.579
<i>So one day, a fire breaks out,</i>
<i>so Washington goes down</i>

04:07.581 --> 04:08.847
<i>and tries to put the fire out,</i>
<i>and he's not really</i>

04:08.849 --> 04:12.484
<i>paying attention, but he comes</i>
<i>up too fast and contracts</i>

04:12.486 --> 04:14.386
the bends, 'cause
it was all pressurized.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.922
So if you come up too fast,
you begin to develop air bubbles

04:16.924 --> 04:22.027
<i>in your blood stream and</i>
<i>basically can create paralysis.</i>

04:22.029 --> 04:24.329
I mean, this is, like,
a family struck

04:24.331 --> 04:25.864
with all kinds of [bleep].

04:25.866 --> 04:26.531
[laughs]
- Yeah.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.868
- What's happening right now?
I'm so drunk.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.503
- Cheers.

04:31.505 --> 04:35.907
- Um, so now that he's basically
bedridden, Washington's like,

04:35.909 --> 04:39.378
<i>so much pain and agony</i>
<i>from this stupid disease,</i>

04:39.380 --> 04:42.514
and I don't even know how
I'm gonna finish the bridge.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.548
And Emily steps up,
and she's like,

04:43.550 --> 04:46.018
<i>I will complete this bridge</i>
<i>for you because you're my</i>

04:46.020 --> 04:50.789
<i>everything, and I will do</i>
<i>whatever it takes to make</i>

04:50.791 --> 04:51.890
<i>your legacy continue.</i>

04:51.892 --> 04:58.597
<i>So she took it upon herself</i>
<i>to learn engineering and took</i>

04:58.599 --> 05:03.402
<i>all his instructions to</i>
<i>the team every day and became</i>

05:03.404 --> 05:05.437
<i>like the chief engineer.</i>

05:05.439 --> 05:07.506
And you know women didn't have
privilege back then,

05:07.508 --> 05:10.075
so people were like,
aw, you're a woman.

05:10.077 --> 05:13.378
<i>Shut the [bleep] up and go feed</i>
<i>your baby with your titties.</i>

05:13.380 --> 05:15.047
<i>Can I say that?</i>
<i>Can I say "titties"?</i>

05:15.049 --> 05:16.915
<i>- Yeah, titties is</i>
<i>my favorite word.</i>

05:16.917 --> 05:17.783
<i>- Okay, titties.</i>

05:17.785 --> 05:18.917
[laughs]
I love titties.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.887
So Emily Roebling slapped
the [bleep] out that man,

05:21.889 --> 05:25.557
<i>and she's like, oh, no.</i>
<i>I'm gonna teach you everything</i>

05:25.559 --> 05:27.592
<i>you need to know about building</i>
<i>this bridge properly,</i>

05:27.594 --> 05:29.594
<i>and that's what we gonna do.</i>

05:29.596 --> 05:33.532
<i>And ain't gonna be no more</i>
<i>talk--no more backtalk, 'kay?</i>

05:33.534 --> 05:37.669
<i>So over the next nine years,</i>
<i>Emily is running the [bleep]</i>

05:37.671 --> 05:42.708
<i>out of this bridge, and in 1883</i>
<i>the bridge is complete.</i>

05:42.710 --> 05:45.777
<i>And Washington was like,</i>
<i>Emily, I need you to be</i>

05:45.779 --> 05:48.680
<i>the first person</i>
<i>to cross the bridge.</i>

05:48.682 --> 05:49.581
<i>Would you do this for me?</i>

05:49.583 --> 05:52.818
<i>And she was like, hell yeah.</i>

05:52.820 --> 05:56.121
<i>And so she hops in a carriage</i>
<i>with a little white rooster</i>

05:56.123 --> 05:57.022
<i>on her shoulder</i>

05:57.024 --> 05:59.391
as a symbol of victory.

05:59.393 --> 06:02.060
<i>And she was like, yeah,</i>
<i>I [bleep] built this [bleep].</i>

06:02.062 --> 06:03.829
<i>Do you see me?</i>
<i>I'm up on this mother[bleep],</i>

06:03.831 --> 06:07.499
<i>and I am turnin' it out.</i>

06:07.501 --> 06:12.471
<i>I'm Emily mother[bleep] Roman--</i>
<i>Roebling, and I got this white</i>

06:12.473 --> 06:15.707
<i>cock on my shoulder,</i>
<i>and I built the [bleep]</i>

06:15.709 --> 06:16.575
<i>out this bridge.</i>

06:16.577 --> 06:20.078
<i>And she rides across that</i>
<i>Brooklyn Bridge in a carriage</i>

06:20.080 --> 06:25.984
<i>with a white rooster on her</i>
<i>shoulder, and history is set.</i>

06:25.986 --> 06:28.620
<i>- Wow,</i>
<i>- Crazy, right?</i>

06:28.622 --> 06:33.725
I dunno what happened, but I
got way drunker than last time.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.962
[yelling]
Derek, Derek!

06:36.964 --> 06:38.830
Derek!

06:38.832 --> 06:40.699
Oh, hey, Derek!

06:40.701 --> 06:41.500
- Hi, Daryl.
- How you doin'?

06:41.502 --> 06:45.604
- I'm good, you?
- I dunno. I'm drunk as [bleep].

06:45.606 --> 06:46.705
- I got you.
- Thank you, Derek.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.474
- Use my shoulder.
- [grunts]

06:49.476 --> 06:50.742
Okay.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.877
- All right.
- [snores]

06:51.879 --> 06:55.914
- No sleep till--
- No, Brooklyn!

06:55.916 --> 07:00.519
Dun, dun, dun dun.
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.154
<i>- I feel a little drunker</i>
<i>this time, so--</i>

07:02.156 --> 07:02.754
- I know you are.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.556
- [gasps]
Are y'all still filming?

07:04.558 --> 07:07.426
- Yeah, this is a reality show.
- Oh, okay.

07:07.428 --> 07:13.231
So I mean, I was, like, to
Courtney, like, no, you did not,

07:13.233 --> 07:14.566
but you were
there for it, Derek.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.568
- Oh, yeah, I was
at the bar that night.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.736
That bitch had it comin'.

07:17.738 --> 07:21.540
That's the only reality line I
know: that bitch had it comin'.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.408
[both laughing]

07:23.410 --> 07:28.547
- Hello, my name is Jenny
Johnson, and we are gonna learn

07:28.549 --> 07:32.384
about con man Victor Lustig.

07:32.386 --> 07:35.487
So [bleep] buckle up.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.322
- [laughs]

07:37.324 --> 07:41.193
-<i> Uh, our story's</i>
<i>gonna begin in 1925.</i>

07:41.195 --> 07:44.162
<i>Everyone in Paris [bleep]</i>

07:44.164 --> 07:45.330
hates the Eiffel Tower

07:45.332 --> 07:48.600
<i>because it was constructed</i>
<i>for the World's Fair,</i>

07:48.602 --> 07:51.269
<i>and it was never</i>
<i>meant to be permanent.</i>

07:51.271 --> 07:53.472
And now it costs
too much for repairs.

07:53.474 --> 07:58.276
<i>And so one day, this dude named</i>
<i>Victor Lustig opens this French</i>

07:58.278 --> 08:01.746
<i>paper up and starts reading</i>
<i>about this, and he says,</i>

08:01.748 --> 08:05.317
<i>I know what I'm doing,</i>
<i>and what I'm gonna be doing</i>

08:05.319 --> 08:11.223
is rippin' people off,
but ripping dumb assholes off.

08:11.225 --> 08:11.857
And so he looked up

08:11.859 --> 08:16.428
<i>five of the most, like,</i>
<i>well-known scrap metal dealers</i>

08:16.430 --> 08:17.496
<i>and let them know</i>

08:17.498 --> 08:20.465
that he had a very,

08:20.467 --> 08:25.370
a very lucrative enterprise.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.104
And he's like,

08:26.106 --> 08:30.108
<i>hey, you know what--I'm gonna</i>
<i>rock the [bleep] out of this.</i>

08:30.110 --> 08:34.613
<i>And Victor got a limo, he would</i>
<i>take these scrap metal people</i>

08:34.615 --> 08:36.414
<i>to the Eiffel Tower,</i>
<i>and he's like,</i>

08:36.416 --> 08:38.250
<i>we're tearin' this bitch down.</i>

08:38.252 --> 08:41.520
<i>And I've got</i>
<i>the inside [bleep], okay?</i>

08:41.522 --> 08:42.454
<i>So he finds his mark.</i>

08:42.456 --> 08:44.789
<i>He finds the guy who was</i>
<i>a little, like, new and green,</i>

08:44.791 --> 08:50.128
<i>and the guy's name was</i>
<i>Andre Poisson, and that's</i>

08:50.130 --> 08:52.297
<i>how you pronounce it--</i>
<i>it sounds like "pussy."</i>

08:52.299 --> 08:54.866
<i>It's not pussy,</i>
<i>but, yes, you're right,</i>

08:54.868 --> 08:55.567
<i>it does sound like that.</i>

08:55.569 --> 08:58.403
So Victor was like, yep,

08:58.405 --> 09:01.239
<i>Andre, you're my dog,</i>
<i>you're my dude.</i>

09:01.241 --> 09:04.242
<i>The Eiffel Tower?</i>
<i>Break that bitch down.</i>

09:04.244 --> 09:09.414
<i>And Andre's like, of course</i>
<i>I'm gonna buy the Eiffel Tower</i>

09:09.416 --> 09:10.215
<i>from this guy.</i>

09:10.217 --> 09:16.288
<i>So $70,000 Victor Lustig</i>
<i>takes from this dude,</i>

09:16.290 --> 09:20.358
<i>and bounces the [bleep]</i>
<i>out of France.</i>

09:20.360 --> 09:21.860
<i>And he keeps lookin'</i>
<i>at the papers.</i>

09:21.862 --> 09:24.829
<i>When is this gonna,</i>
<i>you know, show up?</i>

09:24.831 --> 09:26.431
It never shows up because

09:26.433 --> 09:28.900
<i>Andre Poisson didn't even</i>
<i>go to the police because</i>

09:28.902 --> 09:33.538
<i>he was too embarrassed,</i>
<i>and he lost 70 grand.</i>

09:33.540 --> 09:36.174
<i>So Vic goes back to Paris.</i>

09:36.176 --> 09:38.510
<i>He says, eh,</i>
<i>I'll do this [bleep] again.</i>

09:38.512 --> 09:39.477
<i>Why the [bleep] not?</i>

09:39.479 --> 09:43.248
<i>Except this time, he gets</i>
<i>the bomb-ass suite in, like,</i>

09:43.250 --> 09:44.883
<i>the most baller hotel.</i>

09:44.885 --> 09:50.622
<i>It was like The Cubdoop de</i>
<i>Crill Leptoo--Four Seasons.</i>

09:50.624 --> 09:51.823
So Victor brings
all these folks in

09:51.825 --> 09:56.595
<i>to his bomb-ass hotel suite</i>
<i>and feels like, hey, man,</i>

09:56.597 --> 09:58.163
<i>that--that's my mark.</i>
<i>That's the guy.</i>

09:58.165 --> 10:04.669
<i>He's eager, he's interested.</i>
<i>So Victor says, okay,</i>

10:04.671 --> 10:09.908
<i>I am a French official times</i>
<i>ten, my [bleep] is official</i>

10:09.910 --> 10:13.845
<i>as [bleep], but this guy</i>
<i>through the whole thing</i>

10:13.847 --> 10:17.248
<i>was going, this sounds like</i>
<i>the most crooked [bleep]</i>

10:17.250 --> 10:17.849
<i>I've ever heard.</i>

10:17.851 --> 10:20.418
<i>So he ends up going</i>
<i>to the police, saying,</i>

10:20.420 --> 10:24.289
<i>I think this guy's trying</i>
<i>to scam me, and y'all should</i>

10:24.291 --> 10:26.524
<i>bust the [bleep] out of him.</i>

10:26.526 --> 10:28.960
Victor gets wind of it and says

10:28.962 --> 10:29.728
<i>bouncin' out again.</i>

10:29.730 --> 10:35.333
<i>And he goes to Chicago</i>
<i>with another awesome scam</i>

10:35.335 --> 10:36.434
like you would not believe.

10:36.436 --> 10:41.406
<i>Victor goes to Al Capone</i>
<i>and says, I'm Victor Lustig,</i>

10:41.408 --> 10:45.310
<i>but you can call me The Count,</i>
<i>which is a baller nickname.</i>

10:45.312 --> 10:45.844
<i>- The Count.</i>

10:45.846 --> 10:47.479
<i>- Not--no, you just</i>
<i>said the c-word.</i>

10:47.481 --> 10:49.247
<i>- No, I--no I said The Cou--</i>

10:49.249 --> 10:51.249
- You said The [bleep], you--
- No, I didn't.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.651
- Yeah, you did, a little bit.
- I quietly said

10:52.653 --> 10:54.586
<i>The Count.</i>
<i>- Could everyone in this room</i>

10:54.588 --> 10:57.789
<i>agree that he kinda said</i>
<i>The [bleep]?</i>

10:57.791 --> 10:58.790
<i>They agreed.</i>

10:58.792 --> 10:59.624
- Okay...
- Okay.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.393
- So what did
The [bleep] say?

11:01.395 --> 11:03.428
- [laughs]

11:03.430 --> 11:09.300
<i>So here's the deal, Al:</i>
<i>I got this guy</i>

11:09.302 --> 11:10.835
<i>who's gonna triple your money.</i>

11:10.837 --> 11:14.005
<i>I just need 50 grand</i>
<i>from you, in cash.</i>

11:14.007 --> 11:18.610
Now I'm sorry--this is in the
1920s--do you scam Al Capone?

11:18.612 --> 11:19.544
'Cause I'm pretty sure

11:19.546 --> 11:21.413
he'll cut your dick off.
- Yeah.

11:21.415 --> 11:22.480
- He's like,
hey, I have your dick,

11:22.482 --> 11:24.949
<i>and, like, juggle dicks</i>
<i>with like--juggle dead,</i>

11:24.951 --> 11:27.018
he like--he'll juggle dicks
in front of you.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.889
<i>- Yeah, best dick-juggler ever.</i>
<i>- Everyone knows that.</i>

11:30.891 --> 11:34.659
<i>So Al Capone gives Victor</i>
<i>$50,000 and says,</i>

11:34.661 --> 11:37.362
<i>yeah, triple that [bleep].</i>

11:37.364 --> 11:39.964
<i>And Victor goes, pff, awesome.</i>

11:39.966 --> 11:44.703
But he takes it and puts it in
a safe and just leaves it there,

11:44.705 --> 11:47.005
<i>and then after two months</i>
<i>he goes back to Al Capone</i>

11:47.007 --> 11:49.974
<i>and says, hey, A.C.,</i>
<i>I lost all your money,</i>

11:49.976 --> 11:55.847
<i>but I'm not a dick like that,</i>
<i>so here's $50,000</i>

11:55.849 --> 11:56.648
<i>out of my own pocket.</i>

11:56.650 --> 12:00.385
<i>And Al Capone goes, hey, man,</i>
<i>thanks for being honest.</i>

12:00.387 --> 12:03.688
<i>He gives him $5,000</i>
<i>just for a...</i>

12:03.690 --> 12:04.122
thanks.

12:04.124 --> 12:07.792
<i>Victor was asked, why in the</i>
<i>[bleep] would you,</i>

12:07.794 --> 12:11.296
<i>like, it's Al Capone.</i>
<i>He juggles dicks.</i>

12:11.298 --> 12:13.064
<i>And he said, I just</i>
<i>wanna gain his trust.</i>

12:13.066 --> 12:18.303
<i>I'm a con man.</i>
<i>If I [bleep] up, that dude--</i>

12:18.305 --> 12:19.571
<i>now he trusts me.</i>

12:19.573 --> 12:21.439
<i>And he goes around</i>
<i>place to place</i>

12:21.441 --> 12:24.576
with all of the dozens
and dozens

12:24.578 --> 12:25.910
<i>of scams that he comes up with.</i>

12:25.912 --> 12:31.382
<i>But they end up finding this</i>
<i>ass and sent him to Alcatraz.</i>

12:31.384 --> 12:34.052
<i>But this dude</i>
<i>was known as The Count,</i>

12:34.054 --> 12:37.655
and he came up with
this ten commandments of

12:37.657 --> 12:39.324
how to con people, being:

12:39.326 --> 12:42.026
<i>be a patient listener.</i>
<i>Never look bored.</i>

12:42.028 --> 12:45.663
<i>Wait for the other person's</i>
<i>political opinion,</i>

12:45.665 --> 12:47.365
<i>and always agree.</i>

12:47.367 --> 12:49.634
<i>You always let the other person</i>
<i>bring up religion,</i>

12:49.636 --> 12:51.035
<i>and then you always agree.</i>

12:51.037 --> 12:56.040
<i>Hint at sex talk, but always</i>
<i>let them bring it up.</i>

12:56.042 --> 12:57.742
<i>Never discuss illness.</i>

12:57.744 --> 13:00.578
<i>Never pry into</i>
<i>their personal circumstances.</i>

13:00.580 --> 13:06.117
<i>Never boast, never be untidy,</i>
<i>and never get drunk.</i>

13:08.053 --> 13:09.554
<i>Oh, and Al Capone</i>
<i>went to jail, too.</i>

13:09.556 --> 13:10.989
<i>- Well, yeah,</i>
<i>he's a dick-juggler.</i>

13:10.991 --> 13:14.359
- [laughs]

13:18.230 --> 13:19.664
- So hello, my friend.
- Hello.

13:19.666 --> 13:23.368
- Uh, because we're telling
a story that takes place

13:23.370 --> 13:27.372
in the era of Shakespeare,
in Elizabethan England, for us,

13:27.374 --> 13:30.241
I have...
- Oh, my dear lord.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.677
- You wanna go old school
on this one?

13:32.679 --> 13:34.279
- What is this?
- This is ale, my friend.

13:34.281 --> 13:38.583
This is real,
dark, delicious ale.

13:38.585 --> 13:42.253
Take a swig.
- Mm.

13:42.255 --> 13:46.224
- Atta boy.
- Oh, my God.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.693
- Oh, it just went
down my shirt.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.361
- Oh, Mark--
- I'm good.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.698
Hello,
my name's Mark Gagliardi,

13:53.700 --> 13:56.100
and today
we're gonna talk about

13:56.102 --> 14:02.340
William Shakespeare and
the Great Theater Heist of 1598.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.077
- [laughs]
Oh, [bleep].

14:06.079 --> 14:08.513
- All right, let me set
the stage for you:

14:08.515 --> 14:11.583
<i>it's the late 16th century,</i>
<i>in a neighborhood just north</i>

14:11.585 --> 14:14.719
<i>of London called Shoreditch</i>
<i>where the most brilliant minds</i>

14:14.721 --> 14:19.090
<i>of the time have started</i>
<i>gathering at the taverns.</i>

14:19.092 --> 14:22.727
<i>You've got Sir Walter Raleigh,</i>
<i>and Christopher Marlowe,</i>

14:22.729 --> 14:24.696
<i>who's like the biggest</i>
<i>playwright in the world.</i>

14:24.698 --> 14:28.299
<i>And it was there that a guy</i>
<i>named James Burbage makes</i>

14:28.301 --> 14:32.070
<i>this land deal with Giles Allen</i>

14:32.072 --> 14:34.339
<i>and decides</i>
<i>to build his own theater.</i>

14:34.341 --> 14:37.342
<i>It is called The Theatre,</i>

14:37.344 --> 14:39.210
<i>with an "re" not an "er."</i>

14:39.212 --> 14:42.180
<i>You do it with an "re"</i>
<i>'cause it's classier.</i>

14:42.182 --> 14:43.381
<i>- Yeah.</i>

14:43.383 --> 14:46.084
<i>- So William Shakespeare</i>
<i>shows up.</i>

14:46.086 --> 14:47.485
<i>I'm William Shakespeare.</i>

14:47.487 --> 14:49.821
<i>I'm the new guy, um...</i>

14:53.492 --> 14:57.462
So, in re--in, uh,
so then he spends

14:57.464 --> 14:59.831
he late 1580s, uh, writing...

14:59.833 --> 15:03.134
<i>- [laughs]</i>
<i>- And starring in some of his</i>

15:03.136 --> 15:07.639
<i>early works, but in 1594,</i>
<i>the theater scene</i>

15:07.641 --> 15:11.075
<i>was viciously crippled</i>
<i>by a bubonic plague outbreak.</i>

15:11.077 --> 15:15.780
<i>So James Burbage, founder of</i>
<i>The Theatre has decided,</i>

15:15.782 --> 15:19.117
<i>here's what I'm gonna do:</i>
<i>I'm gonna get together</i>

15:19.119 --> 15:23.788
<i>a troupe of actors made of all</i>
<i>of the actors whose troupes</i>

15:23.790 --> 15:27.292
<i>had disbanded during</i>
<i>the bubonic plague</i>

15:27.294 --> 15:30.094
<i>and create a super group</i>

15:30.096 --> 15:33.731
<i>of Elizabethan actors called</i>

15:33.733 --> 15:37.335
<i>The Lord Chamberlain's Men.</i>

15:37.337 --> 15:38.803
[sighs]

15:38.805 --> 15:40.405
- Would you like water?

15:42.341 --> 15:43.741
I'll take that as a no.

15:43.743 --> 15:47.745
Okay... point taken.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.682
- So Shakespeare's found
his home

15:50.684 --> 15:54.419
<i>and his home is The Theatre.</i>
<i>And at this time,</i>

15:54.421 --> 15:55.687
<i>Shakespeare is prolific.</i>

15:55.689 --> 15:57.822
<i>He's writing</i>
<i>some of his best plays.</i>

15:57.824 --> 16:00.525
<i>He's churning out--</i>
<i>he's like, oh, hey, here,</i>

16:00.527 --> 16:01.526
<i>try this one out.</i>

16:01.528 --> 16:02.727
<i>This one's called "Hamlet."</i>

16:02.729 --> 16:06.331
<i>Here, try this one out.</i>
<i>I call this one "Othello."</i>

16:06.333 --> 16:09.334
<i>You're probably gonna need some</i>
<i>shoe polish to play Othello,</i>

16:09.336 --> 16:13.304
<i>but nobody's socially conscious</i>
<i>enough that blackface isn't</i>

16:13.306 --> 16:17.842
<i>a bad thing at this point.</i>
<i>So Shakespeare has these guys</i>

16:17.844 --> 16:23.314
<i>doing these</i>
<i>amazing plays until 1597.</i>

16:23.316 --> 16:27.285
<i>Giles Allen says, oh,</i>
<i>you wanna renew the lease?</i>

16:27.287 --> 16:30.688
<i>Hang on a second.</i>
<i>I've decided these plays</i>

16:30.690 --> 16:34.726
<i>are bull[bleep].</i>
<i>I hate The Theatre.</i>

16:34.728 --> 16:37.729
<i>And James Burbage is like,</i>
<i>wait, what?</i>

16:37.731 --> 16:42.867
So Giles Allen--Guyles Allen?
Giles Allen? Giles Allen says,

16:42.869 --> 16:48.339
<i>I'm a Puritan, so I think</i>
<i>that plays are dumb even though</i>

16:48.341 --> 16:51.442
<i>you're doing Shakespeare, and</i>
<i>your plays are gonna be read</i>

16:51.444 --> 16:57.482
<i>by [bleep] school kids in 2015,</i>
<i>because they're that</i>

16:57.484 --> 17:02.954
<i>G.D. important,</i>
<i>theater is like, you know,</i>

17:02.956 --> 17:05.223
<i>of the devil, so sorry.</i>

17:05.225 --> 17:09.894
<i>And James Burbage was so</i>
<i>distraught by this</i>

17:09.896 --> 17:13.431
<i>that he died of a broken heart.</i>

17:13.433 --> 17:18.803
<i>And Giles Allen said,</i>
<i>James Burbage is dead, this is</i>

17:18.805 --> 17:22.473
<i>my land, I'm gonna do</i>
<i>what I want with it.</i>

17:22.475 --> 17:26.611
<i>But one of The Lord</i>
<i>Chamberlain's Men went,</i>

17:26.613 --> 17:30.381
<i>hey, fellas, hang on a second.</i>

17:30.383 --> 17:35.720
<i>I've been looking at the lease,</i>
<i>the, like, actual piece</i>

17:35.722 --> 17:38.823
<i>of paper that our lease</i>
<i>is written on,</i>

17:38.825 --> 17:42.427
<i>and that lease says</i>
<i>Giles Allen owns the land,</i>

17:42.429 --> 17:48.433
<i>but... technically speaking...</i>

17:48.435 --> 17:50.535
<i>we own the building.</i>

17:50.537 --> 17:53.371
<i>What are we going to do</i>
<i>about this?</i>

17:55.240 --> 17:58.543
So then...
[groans]

17:58.545 --> 18:01.379
Hold on.
[exclaims]

18:01.381 --> 18:01.813
So then--

18:01.815 --> 18:02.580
[groans]

18:02.582 --> 18:08.386
<i>[patriotic music]</i>

18:08.388 --> 18:09.520
- [groans]
I was trying to be good

18:09.522 --> 18:11.089
this episode and not
wind up on the floor.

18:11.091 --> 18:15.326
- Here you go.
- Mm-hmm, thank you.

18:15.328 --> 18:21.265
<i>So on the night</i>
<i>of December 28, 1598,</i>

18:21.267 --> 18:24.402
<i>it happened that Puritan</i>
<i>landowner Giles Allen</i>

18:24.404 --> 18:27.438
<i>was out of town</i>
<i>for the Christmas holiday.</i>

18:27.440 --> 18:30.274
<i>The Lord Chamberlain's Men</i>
<i>decided to take matters</i>

18:30.276 --> 18:33.411
<i>into their own hands.</i>

18:33.413 --> 18:36.080
<i>William Shakespeare</i>
<i>and the members</i>

18:36.082 --> 18:39.283
of The Lord Chamberlain's Men

18:39.285 --> 18:40.318
<i>are like, you know what?</i>

18:40.320 --> 18:46.357
<i>This building belongs to us,</i>
<i>and we're going to take it.</i>

18:46.359 --> 18:49.894
<i>They went into the costume</i>
<i>storage rooms, they put on</i>

18:49.896 --> 18:54.432
<i>their most terrifying military</i>
<i>battle gear,</i>

18:54.434 --> 18:58.569
<i>and they proceeded to take down</i>

18:58.571 --> 19:01.272
<i>the entire building,</i>

19:01.274 --> 19:06.310
<i>including the 30-foot beams</i>
<i>that held the building aloft.</i>

19:06.312 --> 19:11.315
<i>Brick by brick,</i>
<i>every last piece.</i>

19:12.050 --> 19:15.319
- I got you.
- What are we talking about?

19:15.321 --> 19:20.925
- Um, Alexander Hamilton.
- How dare you.

19:20.927 --> 19:26.964
<i>So, uh, when Giles Allen came</i>
<i>back, he realized that,</i>

19:26.966 --> 19:30.935
<i>oh, my God, the land</i>
<i>that I own, uh, this land</i>

19:30.937 --> 19:35.373
<i>used to have a theater on it,</i>
<i>and no longer does.</i>

19:35.375 --> 19:38.109
<i>What the eff happened?</i>

19:39.511 --> 19:42.680
- I'm gonna try
to bring you back up.

19:42.682 --> 19:47.351
- So Shakespeare
and The Lord Admir--

19:47.353 --> 19:49.320
Lord Chamberlain's Men,

19:49.322 --> 19:50.521
they took down a whole building,

19:50.523 --> 19:55.092
<i>and they took all of those</i>
<i>pieces across the Thames,</i>

19:55.094 --> 19:57.495
<i>and board by board</i>
<i>they rebuilt this theater,</i>

19:57.497 --> 20:02.667
<i>rechristened it The Globe,</i>
<i>and this is where Shakespeare</i>

20:02.669 --> 20:04.936
<i>premiered his greatest works.</i>

20:04.938 --> 20:09.407
<i>And hey, did you learn "Hamlet"</i>
<i>in high school?</i>

20:09.409 --> 20:14.545
<i>It's 'cause Shakespeare and</i>
<i>his buddies stole a theater.</i>

20:14.547 --> 20:17.114
- Mark, you're the [bleep] best.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.716
I wish you had a drink.
I'd cheers you.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.117
- I got one right here.
- What was that?

20:20.119 --> 20:22.386
- No, where'd it go?
- I dunno.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.055
- I had one.
- You did?

20:24.057 --> 20:26.190
Where'd you put it?
- I don't [bleep] know,

20:26.192 --> 20:30.127
but I'm gonna do this with ya.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.262
- Here's your drink.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.396
- Was this mine?
- Yeah.

20:32.398 --> 20:36.300
