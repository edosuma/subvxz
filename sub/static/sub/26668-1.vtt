So, what do you think gives you muscles?

00:15.725 --> 00:18.937
What foods do we need to eat
to build muscles?

00:20.229 --> 00:24.399
Um, like, carrots, tomatoes.

00:24.483 --> 00:28.947
Um, and I actually
eat tomatoes like candy.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.990
Right. Do you think spinach helps?

00:32.616 --> 00:35.077
I don't really eat spinach.
I don't really like spinach,

00:35.160 --> 00:37.037
but look how strong I am.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.288

My name is Joe Cross.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.215
<i>And I'm sitting here with a bunch of kids,</i>

01:30.299 --> 01:32.175
<i>and we're talking food.</i>

01:33.761 --> 01:34.679
<i>About 10 years ago,</i>

01:34.762 --> 01:38.140
<i>I was struggling with obesity</i>
<i>and chronic disease.</i>

01:38.223 --> 01:40.643
<i>So, I made some pretty big changes,</i>

01:40.727 --> 01:41.936
<i>became a healthy eater,</i>

01:42.020 --> 01:45.230
<i>and made a documentary about the process.</i>

01:45.314 --> 01:49.027
<i>Little did I know that my film </i>
<i>would resonate with so many people.</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:52.321
<i>And the success of that film</i>
<i>has sent me all over the world,</i>

01:52.404 --> 01:55.867
<i>talking to tens of thousands of people</i>
<i>about their health</i>

01:55.950 --> 01:58.118
<i>and the topics that matter to them.</i>

01:58.201 --> 02:00.830
And I tell you, the number one question
that keeps coming up

02:00.913 --> 02:02.999
<i>is "Joe, what about the kids?"</i>

02:03.082 --> 02:04.541
What can we do

02:04.626 --> 02:08.045
<i>to keep our kids healthy</i>
<i>and fight childhood obesity?</i>

02:08.127 --> 02:12.257
Which is a real problem
in just about every country I visited.

02:12.341 --> 02:15.845
What about fruits and veggies?
Do you ever eat fruits and veggies?

02:15.928 --> 02:17.764
<i>Sitting around</i>
<i>chatting to these youngsters</i>

02:17.847 --> 02:19.891
<i>brought back memories</i>
<i>of when I was their age.</i>

02:19.974 --> 02:21.726
<i>Sure, I ate fruits and veggies</i>

02:21.809 --> 02:23.645
<i>when Mum and Dad made us,</i>

02:23.728 --> 02:27.065
<i>but they certainly weren't top of the list</i>
<i>when it came to my favorites.</i>

02:27.147 --> 02:29.984
<i>In fact, they were probably</i>
<i>way down the bottom,</i>

02:30.068 --> 02:32.361
<i>even thought I knew they were good for me.</i>

02:32.444 --> 02:35.948
My favorite food when I was your age...

02:36.032 --> 02:40.160
was ice cream
with chocolate flavoring on top.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.371
<i>And these guys, they were no different. </i>

02:42.454 --> 02:44.916
My favorite food is donuts.

02:44.999 --> 02:47.960
Dumplings, and... I like pizza.

02:48.044 --> 02:49.962
-Pizza.
-Cheesecake.

02:50.046 --> 02:51.881
Chicken fingers and ice cream.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.050
-Ice cream.
-Ice cream.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.509
[Joe Cross]
<i>And it got me thinking.</i>

02:55.592 --> 02:57.136
<i>If I knew back then</i>

02:57.219 --> 03:00.014
<i>that fruits and vegetables</i>
<i>made me healthy and strong,</i>

03:00.098 --> 03:02.725
<i>why did I struggle to eat them?</i>

03:02.809 --> 03:06.854
<i>And I'm pretty sure the same could be said</i>
<i>for millions of other people.</i>

03:06.938 --> 03:08.563
Why did you choose this?

03:08.647 --> 03:10.775
Well, because I'm lazy, and it looks good.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.778
<i>But contrary to what</i>
<i>we're told in the media,</i>

03:13.861 --> 03:16.864
<i>obesity itself isn't the main problem.</i>

03:16.948 --> 03:19.658
<i>It's all the diseases</i>
<i>which become more commonplace</i>

03:19.742 --> 03:22.411
<i>when living at an unhealthy weight.</i>

03:22.494 --> 03:24.956
But in order to deal
with childhood obesity

03:25.039 --> 03:26.916
and the downstream effects,

03:26.999 --> 03:29.376
we need to understand the root cause.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.129
<i>After talking to some experts,</i>

03:31.211 --> 03:34.966
it became clear to me
that this problem is three-fold.

03:35.049 --> 03:38.301
<i>Lack of knowledge </i>
<i>of what healthy foods are</i>

03:38.385 --> 03:39.762
<i>and how to prepare them,</i>

03:39.846 --> 03:43.473
<i>lack of access to healthy</i>
<i>and affordable options,</i>

03:43.557 --> 03:45.852
<i>ranging from food deserts in inner cities</i>

03:45.935 --> 03:48.311
<i>to poor school lunch programs,</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:50.940
and the impact of negative role models,

03:51.023 --> 03:54.026
when a parent, a teacher,
or even a celebrity

03:54.110 --> 03:55.903
<i>demonstrates unhealthy behavior.</i>

03:55.987 --> 03:59.364
I pretty much just take a handful of them
like... [gobbles]

03:59.448 --> 04:03.202
[Cross] <i>How can kids today break the cycle</i>
<i>of poor eating habits</i>

04:03.285 --> 04:06.038
<i>that started perhaps a generation ago?</i>

04:06.122 --> 04:09.458
<i>Because I reckon</i>
<i>that if I'd followed a healthier path</i>

04:09.541 --> 04:10.877
<i>ever since I was a kid,</i>

04:10.960 --> 04:14.337
<i>things would have been</i>
<i>completely different for me.</i>

04:14.421 --> 04:18.257
<i>I might not have become</i>
<i>fat, sick, and nearly dead.</i>

04:18.341 --> 04:19.301
<i>And looking back,</i>

04:19.384 --> 04:22.554
<i>boy, I would have loved</i>
<i>to avoid that version of me,</i>

04:22.637 --> 04:25.640
<i>the one that suffered </i>
<i>through pain, unhappiness,</i>

04:25.724 --> 04:28.310
<i>and years of taking medication.</i>

04:28.393 --> 04:31.022
So I decided to try
and figure out how everyone,

04:31.105 --> 04:33.356
<i>teachers, parents, kids,</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:36.778
can come together
and overcome these obstacles.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.781
Where do all the fruits
and vegetables come from?

04:41.032 --> 04:43.700
Uh, gardens.

04:43.785 --> 04:45.368
Gardens where?

04:45.452 --> 04:50.166
Up in countries like, um, the Catskills.

04:50.249 --> 04:53.752
Do you think it's possible
to grow vegetables

04:53.836 --> 04:55.922
on the rooftop of your house?

04:56.005 --> 04:58.507
[scoffs]
I would not like doing that,

04:58.590 --> 05:01.718
because it's pretty dangerous
growing vegetables,

05:01.803 --> 05:05.014
-and I don't have as many plants up there.
-Right.

05:10.895 --> 05:14.816
[Cross] <i>Despite Julian's trepidation </i>
<i>about the dangers of rooftop farming,</i>

05:14.899 --> 05:17.985
<i>some people actually enjoy</i>
<i>growing vegetables up there.</i>

05:18.069 --> 05:22.447
<i>Today I found myself in Brooklyn</i>
<i>at the Eagle Street rooftop farm,</i>

05:22.531 --> 05:23.448
<i>which was a pioneer </i>

05:23.532 --> 05:26.451
<i>in bringing fresh fruits, and vegetables, </i>
<i>and even eggs</i>

05:26.535 --> 05:29.538
<i>to their urban neighbors</i>
<i>who might not otherwise have access</i>

05:29.621 --> 05:32.457
<i>to that kind of fresh, whole food.</i>

05:32.541 --> 05:34.961
<i>While here, I met up with Sam Kass,</i>

05:35.044 --> 05:37.796
<i>one of the country's </i>
<i>leading nutrition experts.</i>

05:37.880 --> 05:40.590
<i>I figured since he spent</i>
<i>the last several years</i>

05:40.674 --> 05:44.136
<i>as the senior nutrition policy advisor</i>
<i>to President Obama,</i>

05:44.220 --> 05:45.972
<i>cooking in the White House kitchen,</i>

05:46.055 --> 05:49.808
<i>and as executive director</i>
<i>of the First Lady's Let's Move initiative,</i>

05:49.892 --> 05:53.062
<i>he might know a thing or two</i>
<i>about where this country is going</i>

05:53.145 --> 05:55.438
<i>when it comes to raising healthy kids.</i>

05:55.522 --> 05:57.066
So, who likes melons?

They keep your tummy all happy.

06:03.072 --> 06:05.199
[Cross]
<i>So, Sam, working in the White House,</i>

06:05.283 --> 06:07.534
from an outsider's point of view,
it looks like a place

06:07.617 --> 06:11.122
where lots of problems come
to try and get solved, right?

06:11.205 --> 06:16.127
<i>How big is the problem, you think,</i>
<i>with what we're all eating?</i>

06:16.210 --> 06:19.005
[Sam Kass] <i>I'd say there are few problems </i>
<i>that are bigger.</i>

06:19.088 --> 06:20.172
Everything is at stake,

06:20.256 --> 06:23.968
our kids' ability to learn,
our healthcare system, our economy.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.971
There are huge costs
when it comes to the issues around health.

06:27.054 --> 06:30.349
<i>Our diet is a huge cause</i>
<i>of preventable death and disease</i>

06:30.432 --> 06:31.350
<i>in this country.</i>

06:31.433 --> 06:33.768
<i>We have to fundamentally shift</i>
<i>what we're eating</i>

06:33.852 --> 06:35.146
<i>and what we're giving to our kids</i>

06:35.229 --> 06:37.647
<i>if we wanna really see</i>
<i>the prosperous future</i>

06:37.731 --> 06:40.318
that we all, you know,
know that our kids deserve.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.571
Right now, kids are seeing
5,500 ads a year for junk food

06:44.654 --> 06:47.782
and about 100 ads
for fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.451
[Cross]
<i>There's an imbalance there, isn't there?</i>

06:49.534 --> 06:50.369
[Kass] <i>A huge imbalance.</i>

06:50.452 --> 06:52.997
<i>An so long as that's the case,</i>
<i>we're not gonna be very successful.</i>

06:53.080 --> 06:55.124
<i>We're not gonna get kids</i>
<i>to want to eat fruits and vegetables.</i>

06:55.207 --> 06:56.042
[Announcer]
<i>Baconator!</i>

06:56.125 --> 06:58.210

<i>They respond to celebrity.</i>

06:58.294 --> 07:00.296
<i>They respond</i>
<i>to the, you know, cartoon characters</i>

07:00.379 --> 07:03.174
<i>on the sugary cereals,</i>
<i>or the candy, or whatever.</i>

07:03.257 --> 07:04.716
They're great!

07:04.799 --> 07:06.801
[Kass]
<i>I think part of what we have to do</i>

07:06.885 --> 07:10.056
is take the power
of characters and marketing

07:10.139 --> 07:11.431
and put it towards healthier foods.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.976
Captain Vegetable!

07:16.062 --> 07:18.605
Oh, Captain Vegetable?

07:18.688 --> 07:19.814
Right now, we have a problem.

07:19.898 --> 07:23.277

07:35.289 --> 07:38.833
Who should be making
the decisions what you eat,

07:38.917 --> 07:40.502
and school choice, and everything else?

07:40.585 --> 07:42.545
[Kass] <i>Doom and gloom, we know that sells.</i>

07:42.629 --> 07:44.215
But actually, what we need is solutions.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.258
And we're seeing people at every level,

07:46.342 --> 07:48.760
from the White House to pre-schoolers,

07:48.843 --> 07:51.305
uh, taking action,
and really changing their communities,

07:51.389 --> 07:52.390
and changing people's lives.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.975
And that's what this is all about.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.247
<i>I am the Urban Youth Programs Director</i>

08:16.330 --> 08:19.250
for the Chicago Botanic Garden
Windy City Harvest program.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.003
And started out
as creating school gardens,

08:22.086 --> 08:25.839
um, for schools in the Chicago
Public School system and beyond.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.133
And what we were noticing is

08:27.216 --> 08:30.552
kids were really excited
about the planting day

08:30.635 --> 08:32.636
and the before and after,
and parents were too.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.932
<i>So, we really wanted</i>
<i>a chance to stick around</i>

08:36.017 --> 08:38.684
and see what happened next.

08:38.768 --> 08:43.024
Um, did this make a difference
in how they viewed the environment?

08:43.107 --> 08:45.317
Did this make a difference
in their lifestyle?

08:45.401 --> 08:47.319
<i>The farms were really a great way</i>

08:47.403 --> 08:50.322
to do a youth development program
around horticulture

08:50.406 --> 08:52.866
in a way that really related to everyone.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.118
Everyone eats food,

08:54.201 --> 08:56.203
and so everyone can get excited
about seeing how it's grown,

08:56.287 --> 08:57.620
because it's super-miraculous.

08:57.704 --> 09:01.167
At first, it was really hard
to get kids to wanna do this.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.751
It was like,
"Where are gonna get these kids?

09:02.834 --> 09:06.088
How are we gonna tell them
it's okay, it's cool, it's fun?"

09:06.172 --> 09:08.090
But now that we've been around
for 10 years,

09:08.174 --> 09:09.632
<i>now, it's word of mouth.</i>

09:09.716 --> 09:13.845
I tried to get so many people to come.
Like, but they didn't wanna go.

09:13.928 --> 09:17.475
Like, I told them this is
a very good experience for everybody,

09:17.557 --> 09:19.268
but they don't believe me, so...

09:19.351 --> 09:20.519
They missing out.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.313
I love this.

09:22.396 --> 09:25.316
It wasn't what I expected,

09:25.399 --> 09:26.317
the green and all that.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.486
I didn't think I was gonna like it,
but it's real nice.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.821
It changed me as a person.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.615
And it help me with, um...

09:33.698 --> 09:34.824
I have anxiety,

09:34.908 --> 09:36.327
and it's really helped me with that.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.121
'Cause now,
I can talk to people with eye contact.

09:39.205 --> 09:40.997
You know, I used
to get sweaty and nervous.

09:41.082 --> 09:42.791
Now, I'm good.

09:42.874 --> 09:46.128
[Fournier] <i>So, seeing how food grows</i>
<i>has been the biggest change.</i>

09:47.171 --> 09:49.381
It just blows teenagers' minds.

09:49.465 --> 09:51.633
It blows everybody's minds.
I mean, it's beautiful.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.802
<i>And those kids who were like,</i>
<i>"I would never eat that.</i>

09:53.885 --> 09:57.098
It's in the dirt, and that's weird,
and I don't eat green things."

09:57.181 --> 10:00.434
<i>And then once they've seen it growing,</i>
<i>how it tastes...</i>

10:00.518 --> 10:02.894
<i>A lot of kids come in not liking tomatoes,</i>

10:02.977 --> 10:04.646
and then they tasted
sun gold cherry tomato,

10:04.729 --> 10:06.524
and they're like,
"What? This isn't a tomato!

10:06.606 --> 10:08.024
What are you giving me?"

10:08.109 --> 10:09.485
And it's totally a tomato,

10:09.568 --> 10:11.445
and then they're converts for life.

10:11.529 --> 10:14.739
When they've planted it themselves,
harvested it, cared for it,

10:14.823 --> 10:16.783

<i>and how it tastes,</i>

10:21.288 --> 10:23.207
and I'm like,
"I'm really not gonna eat that."

10:23.290 --> 10:25.584
But as it kept going on,

10:25.667 --> 10:29.087
part of us working here
was tasting the food.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.257
Part of us working was trying new things.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.759
So, I ended up trying the kale,
swiss chard.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.637
I tried the tomatoes.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.182
There was a lot of stuff
I just tried for the first time,

10:40.266 --> 10:41.350
and I ended up liking it.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.768
I eat green tomatoes, carrots...

10:44.853 --> 10:48.190
spinach, basil, leeks,

10:48.274 --> 10:51.025
and... watermelon,

10:51.109 --> 10:53.695
and swiss chard.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.531
[Director] Did you eat
any of that stuff before?

10:55.614 --> 10:56.656
No.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.784
No.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.329
It was nasty.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.957
[Director] Is your family eating
a little bit differently too?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.626
-Yeah.
-[Director] Because of you?

11:08.710 --> 11:10.462
I teach them to eat right.

11:10.546 --> 11:12.964
Me of anyone
should be living out these principles

11:13.047 --> 11:14.592
and feeding my kids in this way.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.302
And I use it as an excuse all the time.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.803
'Well, my kids wouldn't eat that.
My kids don't wanna try that.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.805
That would be weird to my kids."

11:20.889 --> 11:24.393
<i>But they oftentimes prove me wrong</i>
<i>time and time again.</i>

11:24.476 --> 11:27.396
<i>So, that's true with all of our families.</i>

11:27.479 --> 11:29.523
<i>It totally comes from the kids.</i>

11:29.607 --> 11:31.816
<i>Because parents, we have this idea...</i>

11:31.900 --> 11:33.735
I don't know what we're trying
to protect our kids from.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.487
These healthy vegetables.

11:35.571 --> 11:39.575
But we feel like, "Ah, they won't eat it,
so I'm not even gonna try."

11:41.117 --> 11:45.456
<i>It takes a kid to say, "I want it,</i>
<i>and you should eat it too."</i>

11:45.539 --> 11:48.875
And then that's the circle, the click...

11:48.958 --> 11:51.044
The a-ha moment is had.

11:52.463 --> 11:54.465
[school bell ringing]

11:57.676 --> 11:59.428
[Kate Corcoran]
<i>March is National Nutrition Month,</i>

11:59.511 --> 12:02.847
<i>and it's the best place to springboard</i>
<i>this information for the kids.</i>

12:02.931 --> 12:04.225
<i>We're getting ready for spring.</i>

12:04.308 --> 12:08.019
<i>They sort of have a voracious appetite</i>
<i>for something new</i>

12:08.102 --> 12:09.938
after coming off of the winter,

12:10.021 --> 12:11.398
and they really absorb

12:11.482 --> 12:13.900
all of the information that I give them
like a sponge.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.279
"So, you wanna learn about nutrition?
Keep reading to accomplish that."

12:18.614 --> 12:20.491
"This month is all about nutrition.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.659
I mean, did you ever realize

12:21.741 --> 12:24.953
that one out of three people
will have diabetes in 2050?

12:25.036 --> 12:25.995
Crazy, right?"

12:26.079 --> 12:29.541
"Did you know the first...
The number one killer of America?

12:29.625 --> 12:30.709
Well, it's food.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.877
The killer is heart attack, diabetes.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.838
Not murder. That's down
at the bottom of the list.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.591
You might be thinking, 'What?'"

12:37.675 --> 12:39.551
"So, you better get a membership
at the gym

12:39.635 --> 12:41.052
or make some room in your fridge,

12:41.135 --> 12:44.556
because pretty soon, your fridge
will be filled with fruits and veggies."

12:44.640 --> 12:46.057
[Corcoran]
<i>Why would we not want</i>

12:46.140 --> 12:49.395
<i>the 60% or more processed foods</i>
<i>in our daily diet,</i>

12:49.478 --> 12:51.397
day after day after day?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.106
What's the issue with that?

12:53.189 --> 12:54.525
[Corcoran speaking]

12:54.608 --> 12:55.442
What's gonna happen?

12:57.902 --> 12:59.070
[Corcoran]
Yeah, it's gonna happen.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.197
Where would you want food to come from?

13:01.282 --> 13:02.700
Like, where do you want your food sources?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.660
What are we looking for here? Tyler?

13:04.743 --> 13:06.828
You want it to come
straight from the earth or a tree.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.037
Give me some examples

13:08.121 --> 13:09.914
of food that might be
straight from the earth.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.916
Lettuce.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.043
What kinds of lettuces
are we talking about here?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.878
What kinds of lettuces
are really going to give us

13:15.962 --> 13:18.674
our greatest micronutrient blasts?

13:18.757 --> 13:20.509
Romaine.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.344
Hannah, romaine is a nice one. Yeah?

13:22.428 --> 13:24.137
-Kale.
-Kale, of course.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.640
So using what you've learned,

13:26.724 --> 13:28.975
what would you eat in an entire day,

13:29.058 --> 13:33.146
10 items, that really fit
the ideal healthy plate...

13:34.315 --> 13:36.692
as opposed to...

13:36.775 --> 13:40.362
what most Americans have on their plate
every single day?

13:40.446 --> 13:42.238
-Are you guys ready for this?
-[All] Yeah.

13:42.323 --> 13:45.199
[Corcoran] All right, off you go.
I can't wait to see your projects.

13:46.242 --> 13:50.163
[Cross] <i>So Miss Corcoran's class set out </i>
<i>to list a health day's worth of meals.</i>

13:50.246 --> 13:52.416
<i>Nutrition lessons aren't a part</i>

13:52.499 --> 13:54.959
<i>of Miss C's standard, </i>
<i>fifth grade curriculum,</i>

13:55.043 --> 13:56.587
<i>but she sneaks it in</i>

13:56.670 --> 14:00.382
<i>by building her requisite lessons</i>
<i>around nutrition topics.</i>

14:00.466 --> 14:02.551
<i>Today's class is about percentages,</i>

14:02.634 --> 14:06.304
<i>so the assignment is</i>
<i>to list 10 food items for the day,</i>

14:06.388 --> 14:10.016
<i>each representing 10%</i>
<i>of the daily food intake</i>

14:10.099 --> 14:14.396
<i>with a goal of 60%</i>
<i>being unprocessed or whole foods.</i>

14:14.480 --> 14:18.609
<i>Basically, it's a math lesson</i>
<i>with a little nutrition mixed in.</i>

14:18.692 --> 14:19.942
What are you calling your day?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.362
Micronutrient madness.

14:21.445 --> 14:22.278
I love that.

14:22.363 --> 14:26.282
[Cross] <i>Kate's nutrition lessons</i>
<i>include the idea of smart swaps.</i>

14:26.367 --> 14:29.578
<i>This is a great chance for her class </i>
<i>to think about times in the day</i>

14:29.661 --> 14:33.749
<i>when a piece of fruit or vegetable </i>
<i>could replace a processed snack food.</i>

14:33.832 --> 14:36.167
All right, so, let's just think
for a second here.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.919
Two plus three is what?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.046
Five.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.632
-Plus one is...
-Six.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.926
So, that's like 60% of your food.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.637
I think we're missing four items.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.723
So we have to figure out
where you might put those.

14:49.807 --> 14:51.433
You go ahead and look over that

14:51.517 --> 14:54.770
and think about what
those other four items might possibly be.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.105
Like, where do you think
you might put pancakes?

14:58.356 --> 15:00.024
It's really...

15:00.108 --> 15:01.777
[Corcoran] <i>When you list out</i>
<i>what you eat in a day,</i>

15:01.860 --> 15:04.028
<i>look at a kid,</i>
<i>they have pancakes for breakfast.</i>

15:04.112 --> 15:06.239
<i>They come into school,</i>
<i>they've got fishies for a snack.</i>

15:06.322 --> 15:07.741
<i>And then lunch comes along,</i>

15:07.825 --> 15:09.785
<i>and it's the macaroni and cheese, </i>
<i>the tater tots,</i>

15:09.868 --> 15:11.537
<i>the ham, and the butter, and the bagel.</i>

15:11.620 --> 15:14.330
<i>And then they go home from school,</i>
<i>and it's Pop-Tarts in a package.</i>

15:14.415 --> 15:18.126
<i>And then for dinner,</i>
<i>maybe a delicious lasagna was cooked,</i>

15:18.209 --> 15:19.878
<i>and that sounds fantastic.</i>

15:19.961 --> 15:22.296
<i>But you look</i>
<i>at all of those items in a day,</i>

15:22.380 --> 15:23.799
<i>and you think, "Oh, my god!</i>

15:23.882 --> 15:26.802
<i>90% of what I've eaten in a day </i>
<i>is processed foods."</i>

15:26.885 --> 15:29.638
<i>But, you know,</i>
<i>this is happening every single day,</i>

15:29.721 --> 15:32.390
<i>day after day, </i>
<i>for the majority of these kids.</i>

15:34.476 --> 15:38.605
<i>So, I think for them to write down </i>
<i>in a food journal what you're eating,</i>

15:38.689 --> 15:41.190
<i>and see it before your eyes,</i>
<i>and face the truth that,</i>

15:41.274 --> 15:42.984
"If I continue like this,

15:43.067 --> 15:46.154
I could end up being
potentially very sick someday.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.533
<i>So, maybe instead of those Goldfish,</i>
<i>I'm gonna put in an orange.</i>

15:49.616 --> 15:51.827
<i>Or maybe instead of those Pop-Tarts</i>
<i>when I go home,</i>

15:51.910 --> 15:54.287
<i>I'm gonna grab the celery and the hummus."</i>

15:54.370 --> 15:56.832
Guys, some kids wanted to know
how to spell "quinoa."

15:56.915 --> 16:00.627
[Corcoran] <i>So I've noticed </i>
<i>that they're trying to swap out,</i>

16:00.711 --> 16:02.336
<i>implement some of the ideas,</i>

16:02.420 --> 16:03.630
but it's hard. It's really hard.

16:04.673 --> 16:07.049
<i>Why can't we have cooking classes</i>
<i>in elementary school</i>

16:07.133 --> 16:10.094
<i>that teach kids how to make</i>
<i>a really great, seasonal, healthy meal</i>

16:10.178 --> 16:13.014
<i>based on items you might buy</i>
<i>around the perimeter?</i>

16:14.683 --> 16:17.101
[Cross] <i>Kate's healthy eating lessons </i>
<i>got me thinking.</i>

16:17.185 --> 16:21.523
<i>Not every food in every meal</i>
<i>can be whole foods,</i>

16:21.607 --> 16:26.068
<i>but what if kids and adults</i>
<i>would make some of Kate's smart swaps?</i>

16:27.028 --> 16:29.113
<i>Let's take her daily food diary,</i>

16:29.197 --> 16:31.700
<i>and swap out the fishies for an apple</i>

16:31.783 --> 16:34.953
<i>and the Pop-Tars</i>
<i>with some celery and hummus,</i>

16:35.036 --> 16:38.874
<i>and maybe add in some leafy greens</i>
<i>instead of the tater tots.</i>

16:38.957 --> 16:40.208
<i>What does that look like?</i>

16:40.291 --> 16:42.628
<i>Well, apart from being</i>
<i>a lot more colorful,</i>

16:42.711 --> 16:44.630
<i>I reckon it's a lot better.</i>

16:46.339 --> 16:49.510
So, we know that a child
with one obese parent

16:49.593 --> 16:51.302
is 40% more likely to be obese,

16:51.385 --> 16:54.515
and two obese parents
is 80% more likely to be obese.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.350
So parents are...
couldn't be more important

16:57.433 --> 16:59.686
in ensuring our kids get off
to a healthy start.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.647
So this starts
when they're very, very young,

17:01.730 --> 17:03.941
making sure they're getting
lots of fruits and vegetables,

17:04.022 --> 17:07.944
<i>because it's shaping how our kids taste</i>
<i>and what their taste preferences are.</i>

17:08.027 --> 17:09.695
Oh, my goodness! Look at that.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.990
Aw! A little cute one.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.367
[Kass]
<i>Parents have to lead by example.</i>

17:14.450 --> 17:16.035
<i>And I think </i>
<i>one of the key things they can do,</i>

17:16.117 --> 17:17.829
<i>which is really undervalued,</i>

17:17.913 --> 17:20.248
<i>is how you set up your home</i>
<i>for kids to make decisions.</i>

17:20.330 --> 17:22.250
If there's water
as opposed to sugary drinks,

17:22.333 --> 17:23.710
that's what your kids are gonna drink,

17:23.794 --> 17:25.294
-and that just becomes what they know.
-Yeah.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.338
And I think parents also have
to do that too.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.215
<i>You can't have the kid,</i>
<i>and force them to drink water,</i>

17:29.298 --> 17:30.759
<i>and you're sitting there drinking a soda.</i>

17:30.842 --> 17:34.303
<i>So, I think that kind of leadership </i>
<i>in the home is absolutely vital,</i>

17:34.387 --> 17:36.430
<i>and something that we can do</i>
<i>which costs nothing.</i>

17:36.514 --> 17:39.433
<i>It just means what are you putting out?</i>
<i>What do your kids see?</i>

17:39.517 --> 17:40.978
Because that's what they're gonna eat.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.986
[Cross] <i>A lot of parents really struggle</i>
<i>to get their kids to eat healthier meals.</i>

17:49.068 --> 17:50.528
Where's Lieve-ster?

17:50.612 --> 17:52.739
[Cross]
<i>Enter Dr. Brian Wansink...</i>

17:52.823 --> 17:54.783
Lieve! [screams]

17:55.951 --> 17:57.493
Lieve!

17:57.578 --> 17:59.788
[Cross]
<i>A professor at Cornell University</i>

17:59.871 --> 18:03.291
<i>who focuses on human behavior</i>
<i>when it comes to food.</i>

18:03.374 --> 18:04.500
Hi. Hi.

18:04.585 --> 18:09.006
[Cross] <i>He's put his research from </i>
<i>the nutrition lab to the test at home.</i>

18:09.088 --> 18:12.174
<i>Let's see</i>
<i>if his three daughters pass the test.</i>

18:14.011 --> 18:16.095
[Dr. Wansink]
<i>So, we've talked to hundreds of parents.</i>

18:16.178 --> 18:17.430
<i>We find that most parents say,</i>

18:17.513 --> 18:19.766
<i>"You know, I can't control </i>
<i>what my kids eat."</i>

18:19.850 --> 18:21.059
<i>And they're correct.</i>

18:21.142 --> 18:23.937
<i>Nobody can control 100%</i>
<i>of what your kids do.</i>

18:24.021 --> 18:26.522
<i>But what we've found</i>
<i>is that the person in the household</i>

18:26.607 --> 18:30.027
who purchases
and prepares most of the food

18:30.109 --> 18:35.699
can control about 72%
of what their kids eat.

18:35.782 --> 18:36.700
But the thing is

18:36.783 --> 18:38.660
it's either for the better
or for the worse.

18:38.744 --> 18:40.328
It's for the better
if you've got a fruit bowl.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.288
It's for the worse
if you have a cookie dish.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.247
It's for the better

18:43.331 --> 18:45.458
if you go to a restaurant
that actually serves salad.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.836
Versus if you go to a place
that only serves cheesy fries.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.337
A while back,
somebody came to me and said,

18:49.420 --> 18:53.174
"What can we do
to get our kids to pick the right thing

18:53.257 --> 18:54.425
<i>when we go out for fast food?"</i>

18:54.508 --> 18:57.136
<i>'Cause for most parents,</i>
<i>fast food is a reality.</i>

18:57.219 --> 18:59.472
<i>I don't wanna cook sometimes.</i>

18:59.555 --> 19:00.682
<i>But what do you do to get them</i>

19:00.766 --> 19:03.142
to take the apple slices
instead of the French fries?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.020
Well, you can't say,

19:05.103 --> 19:06.604
"Which is most healthy?"

19:06.688 --> 19:07.856
'Cause they don't care.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.691
They're still gonna
choose the French fries.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.317
But what we found you can do...

19:11.400 --> 19:13.111
if you take a kid

19:13.194 --> 19:15.822
and have him think about things
from another person's perspective,

19:15.906 --> 19:19.492
you can interrupt their script
of just saying,

19:19.575 --> 19:21.995
<i>"I want French fries. I want French fries.</i>
<i>I want French fries."</i>

19:22.079 --> 19:24.413
<i>So we did this study a while back</i>
<i>where we asked people,</i>

19:24.497 --> 19:27.709
"What would Batman eat,
French fries or apple slices?"

19:27.793 --> 19:29.127
And the kid would answer.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.798
Then we'd say, "What do you want,
French fries or apple slices?"

19:32.881 --> 19:33.757
And what happened

19:33.840 --> 19:36.634
the percentage of kids
who asked for apple slices

19:36.718 --> 19:39.220
went up from 5% to 50%.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.555
But it didn't even matter who we used.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.182
We'd say, "Who's your favorite teacher?"

19:43.265 --> 19:45.018
All we had to do was force them

19:45.102 --> 19:48.187
to take somebody else's point of view
for a second,

19:48.270 --> 19:50.065
and it... almost rewired them.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.067
Okay, boys and girls,

19:52.150 --> 19:55.862
what do you think I eat
that helps keep me healthy and strong,

19:55.946 --> 19:58.656
French fries or apples?

19:58.740 --> 20:00.408
[Kids]
We think apples.

20:00.491 --> 20:04.370
That's right. I'm an apple kind of guy.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.958
But all fruits and vegetables
help keep me and you healthy.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.086
So, load up on your fruits
and veggies, kids.

20:11.169 --> 20:14.422
[Kids]
Now, we want apples! Yay!

20:17.675 --> 20:20.971
Okay, so, guys, you've just come back
from getting some food.

20:21.054 --> 20:24.515
Now, you've come back, Lieve,
with a banana

20:24.598 --> 20:26.768
that you're impersonating as a smile.

20:26.852 --> 20:29.062
And Audrey and Valerie
have come back with apples.

20:29.146 --> 20:33.900
Now, is this only because I'm here
that you're getting this,

20:33.984 --> 20:37.528
or what do you normally have
when you come home from school?

20:37.611 --> 20:39.740
-Fruit.
-What sort of fruit do you have?

20:40.656 --> 20:44.243
Banana, or... orange maybe,

20:44.326 --> 20:45.912
or some grapes.

20:45.996 --> 20:50.458
So what about cookies,
and chocolate, and milkshakes, and...

20:50.541 --> 20:52.878
-Does that not happen here at home?
-No.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.796
My mom doesn't make that for us.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.132
-Never?
-No, never.

20:57.215 --> 20:58.759
She makes us smoothies.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.468
So, smoothies. So, what's in...

21:00.551 --> 21:03.221
Out of strawberries or blueberries.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.388
Right, okay.

21:04.472 --> 21:07.349
-So, do you guys like cookies?
-Mm-hmm.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.603
I eat every single sweet stuff
in the world.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.522
You eat every single sweet in the world?

21:13.606 --> 21:16.985
So, Brian, how much focus,
how much thought

21:17.068 --> 21:19.029
do you put into teaching

21:19.112 --> 21:22.406
when it comes to food choices,
nutrition for your kids?

21:22.490 --> 21:24.826
I put very little effort in doing that,

21:24.910 --> 21:26.036
because what I realized is

21:26.119 --> 21:29.330
that it's not necessarily
teaching them about nutrition.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.875
It's just essentially modeling
the right sort of behavior.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.335
So, I eat fruit when I come home.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.336
I eat a good breakfast.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.421
So that's actually
what they see as natural.

21:37.505 --> 21:38.799
But I don't lecture them.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.509
I don't think they know
any facts about nutrition.

21:43.178 --> 21:45.013
<i>One of the things</i>
<i>that we found in our research</i>

21:45.096 --> 21:47.974
<i>was that one thing</i>
<i>that's very enticing to kids</i>

21:48.058 --> 21:51.978
<i>ends up being sort of like</i>
<i>attractive packaging and things like this.</i>

21:52.062 --> 21:55.773
<i>But we found that people are less likely</i>
<i>to choose breakfast cereal</i>

21:55.857 --> 21:57.608
<i>when it's not in its original packaging,</i>

21:57.691 --> 21:59.027
<i>because it doesn't look that attractive.</i>

21:59.110 --> 22:01.071
So we have the breakfast cereal which...

22:01.154 --> 22:03.531
There we go. There we go.

22:03.614 --> 22:06.201
It's not really in the attractive,
typically attractive...

22:06.284 --> 22:07.953
You've taken it out of the package.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.162
It doesn't look that...

22:09.246 --> 22:10.663
Does it look that great looking like this?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.748
No, it looks like dog food actually.

22:12.833 --> 22:16.335
And so, how many days a week
do you guys eat breakfast cereal?

22:16.418 --> 22:18.964
-Once.
-Yeah, Audrey, maybe once.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.715
Um, 100 times.

22:21.799 --> 22:24.302
-Okay.
-A hundred times a week?

22:24.385 --> 22:26.595
You were saying before
that you got rid of the bigger bowls?

22:26.679 --> 22:29.850
Yeah, these used to be
the bowls the kids ate out of.

22:29.933 --> 22:33.061
<i>But when we did research,</i>
<i>it showed that a typical kid will pour</i>

22:33.144 --> 22:36.814
<i>about 44% more cereal</i>
<i>in a bigger bowl than a smaller bowl.</i>

22:36.898 --> 22:38.816
Which ones do you guys use all the time?

22:38.900 --> 22:40.026
That one.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.112
Yeah, we don't even use these anymore.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.114
I usually just...

22:44.197 --> 22:47.741
<i>Making food convenient, attractive, </i>
<i>and normal to eat, if it's healthy food,</i>

22:47.825 --> 22:49.743
it guides them more
toward the thing to do.

22:49.827 --> 22:51.370
Thank you guys.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.290
-Give me five.
-Yeah!

22:53.372 --> 22:54.456
Give him a kitty high five.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.542
Kitty high five!

22:56.625 --> 22:58.460
Kitty high five!

23:02.173 --> 23:05.718
[Cross] <i>So, there was a lot of talk</i>
<i>about the problems of kids and obesity. </i>

23:05.801 --> 23:08.554
<i>I wondered what the science said</i>
<i>about that connection.</i>

23:08.637 --> 23:12.558
<i>So, I asked a scientist, </i>
<i>Dr. Janet Wojcicki.</i>

23:12.641 --> 23:13.767
Here's something I wanna know.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.687
What's the problem with being obese?

23:16.770 --> 23:19.857
It's not obesity, per se,
that's the problem.

23:19.941 --> 23:23.485
Obesity is a marker for metabolic disease.

23:23.569 --> 23:26.530
<i>So, it's a marker for increased risk</i>

23:26.614 --> 23:31.328
<i>for type 2 diabetes, for hypertension,</i>
<i>fatty liver disease.</i>

23:31.410 --> 23:35.999
<i>So, not everybody who is obese</i>
<i>is going to be sick,</i>

23:36.082 --> 23:40.461
<i>and not everybody who is lean</i>
<i>is gonna be free from disease,</i>

23:40.544 --> 23:45.383
<i>but obesity is the best marker </i>
<i>that we have for metabolic disease.</i>

23:45.466 --> 23:50.596
Thirty years ago, to see a child
with type 2 diabetes was a rarity.

23:50.679 --> 23:54.725
Whereas now,
to see children with type 2 diabetes

23:54.808 --> 23:56.435
is much, much more common.

23:56.518 --> 23:57.979
So, what's changed, Janet?

23:58.063 --> 23:59.855
[Dr. Wojcicki]
<i>I think for sure the diet.</i>

23:59.940 --> 24:02.984
<i>Because the problem is everywhere we go,</i>

24:03.068 --> 24:06.862
<i>there are so many</i>
<i>sugar-sweetened beverages out there.</i>

24:06.947 --> 24:10.741
<i>The single biggest contributor</i>
<i>to the obesity epidemic </i>

24:10.824 --> 24:13.661
<i>is beverage intake.</i>

24:13.744 --> 24:19.458
What is it about it that makes it so tasty
and makes it so addictive?

24:19.541 --> 24:21.835
I really believe
there's evolutionary reasons.

24:21.919 --> 24:26.465
<i>We're hardwired to crave fats and sugars.</i>

24:26.548 --> 24:31.720
<i>All the fancy marketing and the packages</i>
<i>that make it look great,</i>

24:31.804 --> 24:34.099
<i>unfortunately, the consumer is confused,</i>

24:34.182 --> 24:37.726
<i>and some stuff is labeled </i>
<i>as nutritious, as healthy, health food.</i>

24:39.020 --> 24:40.646
It's tough. I know. I'm a parent as well.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.107
It's very difficult. You're going--

24:42.190 --> 24:44.692
My son asks me,
"Look, it says it has this, Mom."

24:44.775 --> 24:48.821
Or, "I eat that, and it really said
it had vitamin, you know, D."

24:48.904 --> 24:51.074
So, it's hard.

24:51.157 --> 24:55.245
Or then they want the vitamins.
The gummy bears now also.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.247
<i>Even vitamins. You can't escape the sugar.</i>

24:57.330 --> 24:59.915
So we believe that it's really important

25:00.000 --> 25:04.045
children 0 to 5 are developing
eating behaviors for life.

25:04.129 --> 25:05.629
And we're really at a crisis point.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.048
<i>So train your kids.</i>

25:07.132 --> 25:11.802
<i>When they are at a restaurant,</i>
<i>they're thirsty, drink water and milk.</i>

25:11.885 --> 25:13.637
What's the need for anything else?

25:13.721 --> 25:15.432
[Cross]
<i>Well, after that chat,</i>

25:15.514 --> 25:18.517
<i>my mind was racing back</i>
<i>to when I was a kid.</i>

25:19.518 --> 25:21.312
Mom, I'm thirsty.

25:21.396 --> 25:22.980
Have some water, dear.

25:23.064 --> 25:26.151
But, Mom, why can't I have soda?

25:26.234 --> 25:30.030
[Cross] <i>And the constant battle</i>
<i>I used to have with Mum and Dad for soda.</i>

25:30.113 --> 25:32.490
You know water keeps us healthy.

25:32.573 --> 25:36.327
Why don't we add some lemon to yours
to make it taste fresh?

25:36.411 --> 25:38.163
-[doorbell ringing]
-[dog barking]

25:39.788 --> 25:41.291
Who is it?

25:41.374 --> 25:44.169
-It's your great tasting...
-Refreshingly light...

25:44.252 --> 25:46.628
-Disturbingly sweet...
-Delicious...

25:46.712 --> 25:49.174
[All] And cool friends
from the convenience store.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.549
[dog barking]

25:50.632 --> 25:52.801
Thanks, but no thanks.
It's time for you to leave.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.137
Ow!

25:54.220 --> 25:56.097
I think I dropped something.

26:00.268 --> 26:01.643
[Cross]
<i>Say g'day to Deb Grant.</i>

26:01.727 --> 26:02.895
<i>She's a former school teacher</i>

26:02.978 --> 26:06.690
<i>who noticed a growing trend</i>
<i>in overweight and unhealthy teens,</i>

26:06.774 --> 26:09.360
<i>which opened her eyes</i>
<i>to a pervasive problem,</i>

26:09.444 --> 26:12.530
<i>a lack of awareness</i>
<i>of how most of the stuff we eat</i>

26:12.613 --> 26:15.325
<i>is more harmful than a lot of us realize.</i>

26:15.408 --> 26:20.205
[Deb Grant] <i>When I started reading</i>
<i>about food and food choices,</i>

26:20.288 --> 26:22.915
<i>I was shocked</i>
<i>about how much I didn't know.</i>

26:22.998 --> 26:25.126
But I didn't really know
what to do about it,

26:25.210 --> 26:26.211
so I would suggest, you know,

26:26.294 --> 26:28.879
someone should eat a banana
instead of having Doritos,

26:28.962 --> 26:30.756
and usually, I got a lot of eye rolling,

26:30.839 --> 26:32.049
and it didn't go very far.

26:32.133 --> 26:35.178
[Cross] <i>So she put</i>
<i>her thoughts into action</i>

26:35.261 --> 26:37.805
<i>and started the organization FoodFight</i>

26:37.888 --> 26:39.723
<i>as a way to leverage school environments</i>

26:39.807 --> 26:43.602
<i>to educate and empower students</i>
<i>and teachers alike</i>

26:43.685 --> 26:45.646
<i>and give them the resources and knowledge</i>

26:45.729 --> 26:48.690
<i>of how to make healthier choices</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

26:50.692 --> 26:52.820
[Grant]
<i>I am sure I am not the first person</i>

26:52.903 --> 26:54.780
<i>to stand in front of you and say,</i>

26:54.863 --> 26:57.699
<i>"We are in the midst</i>
<i>of an enormous health crisis."</i>

26:57.783 --> 26:59.993
<i>And I'm sure if I was to ask you</i>

27:00.077 --> 27:07.042
if you know somebody in your family
who is overweight, raise your hand.

27:07.127 --> 27:09.837
Keep it up.
Obesity, raise your other hand.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.548
Heart disease.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.632
-Yeah, raise your foot. Right.
-[laughter]

27:13.715 --> 27:17.094
All right,
all of those lifestyle-related diseases

27:17.178 --> 27:18.471
are connected to what you eat.

27:18.555 --> 27:21.224
And the fact that everybody in this room
is raising their hand

27:21.307 --> 27:23.100
should lead us to understand and believe

27:23.184 --> 27:26.103
that this isn't just her problem
or your problem.

27:26.187 --> 27:27.771
This is a societal issue.

27:27.855 --> 27:31.817
These are sicknesses that are coming
based on what we are putting in our mouths

27:31.900 --> 27:34.862
at lunch, and at breakfast, and at dinner.

27:34.945 --> 27:39.116
If I was to ask you
what do you think are some of the reasons

27:39.200 --> 27:42.077
why we have found ourselves
in that problem...

27:42.162 --> 27:43.829
Anyone wanna-- Yes?

27:43.912 --> 27:45.914
High prices on healthy food.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.418
High prices on healthy food. Absolutely.

27:48.501 --> 27:49.960
That's one. Two?

27:50.043 --> 27:51.546
Some people are depressed.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.381
Some people are depressed.

27:53.464 --> 27:56.301
-And they just eat a lot.
-And so, they overeat. Absolutely.

27:56.384 --> 27:57.885
-What else?
-It's good.

27:57.968 --> 27:58.969
What's good?

27:59.052 --> 28:01.472
-The food that we eat, the unhealthy food.
-The junk food.

28:01.556 --> 28:03.891
The junk food is good, right?

28:03.974 --> 28:08.563
It's comforting, tastes good,
readily available, yeah?

28:08.646 --> 28:13.193
One of the leading culprits
for why that first picture

28:13.318 --> 28:17.405
<i>is how so many people look</i>
<i>walking around today is sugar.</i>

28:17.488 --> 28:21.783
<i>It's about the fact</i>
<i>that we have become sugar addicts.</i>

28:21.867 --> 28:23.494
<i>So I'm gonna put</i>
<i>a couple of drinks up here</i>

28:23.578 --> 28:26.414
<i>that I'm guessing</i>
<i>that some of you are familiar with.</i>

28:27.956 --> 28:30.335
Gatorade. Raise your hand
if you like Gatorade.

28:31.835 --> 28:35.298
<i>Most people don't know,</i>
<i>when they look at sugar grams,</i>

28:35.381 --> 28:37.592
<i>how many teaspoons</i>
<i>of sugar they're consuming.</i>

28:37.675 --> 28:41.178
<i>They have no idea</i>
<i>how you calculate from grams to teaspoons,</i>

28:41.262 --> 28:43.681
<i>that four grams equals one teaspoon.</i>

28:43.764 --> 28:46.267
<i>And so, they look at a label,</i>

28:46.351 --> 28:49.354
<i>and grams exists</i>
<i>completely out of context.</i>

28:51.522 --> 28:53.483
<i>And it's really these light bulb moments,</i>

28:53.566 --> 28:57.570
<i>that notion of, "Oh, if I know</i>
<i>how many teaspoons are in this item,</i>

28:57.654 --> 28:58.820
<i>I can make a choice."</i>

28:58.904 --> 29:01.823
I want you to put these drinks

29:01.907 --> 29:06.246
in order of most sugar to least sugar.

29:06.329 --> 29:08.373
-I think I got this.
-Don't look at the labels.

29:08.456 --> 29:10.667
No looking at the labels.
No, you can't look at the labels.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.962
[Student]
And I think that's it.

29:15.045 --> 29:16.506
[Grant]
Okay, so which is most?

29:17.507 --> 29:19.132
-Coke.
-Okay.

29:19.216 --> 29:20.635
It starts with Coke and then goes down.

29:20.718 --> 29:23.346
Okay, I think he's pretty...
I think he's pretty close.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.222
So, that's-- You're right.

29:25.306 --> 29:28.601
Let's give him a round.
That's good. He got the first one right.

29:28.685 --> 29:32.313
They did not like the sense
that they were being manipulated or played

29:32.397 --> 29:35.023
by the industrial food machinery.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.735
And so they were
much more likely and willing

29:37.818 --> 29:40.821
to kind of engage in conversations
about their diets

29:40.904 --> 29:43.616
once you had defused
this sense of finger wagging

29:43.700 --> 29:46.118
or telling people, you know,

29:46.201 --> 29:48.787
"You're doing a bad job.
You're not making good eating choices."

29:48.870 --> 29:50.415
And then broaden that conversation.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.417
Some of those drinks
I really don't drink a lot.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.209
Probably just the Gatorade.

29:54.294 --> 29:56.337
But that was a surprise,

29:56.421 --> 29:59.590
because every athlete
that you use as a role model,

29:59.674 --> 30:01.049
they're drinking it.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.760
So it makes you wanna drink it,

30:02.843 --> 30:04.679
but you don't notice that
it has that much sugar in it.

30:04.762 --> 30:08.056
It just makes you rethink everything.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.394
When I came home,
I started reading, like, labels.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.936
My mother was like, "What are you doing?"

30:13.020 --> 30:15.315
I'm like, "These people came,

30:15.398 --> 30:18.066
and they talked to us
about sugar and stuff."

30:18.150 --> 30:21.278
And I was like,
"Wow, I was eating a lot of sugar."

30:21.362 --> 30:23.573
And I didn't know
how much sugar I was eating until then.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.575
So, um...

30:26.701 --> 30:28.703
After I was reading everything,

30:28.786 --> 30:31.246
I was like,
"This has a lot, and this doesn't,

30:31.331 --> 30:32.831
so I'm gonna do this instead."

30:32.914 --> 30:34.500
And then, I'm gonna start
drinking more tea

30:34.584 --> 30:37.085
instead of hot chocolate
and stuff like that.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.128
[muttering]
Hot chocolate.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.129
[Producer]
So, that's cool.

30:39.212 --> 30:41.882
What did your mom say
when you told her about that?

30:41.965 --> 30:44.176
I mean, it was
a funny moment for us,

30:44.259 --> 30:48.930
'cause I'm big on sweets.
I love my cakes, my cookies.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.683
I'm big on sweets.

30:50.767 --> 30:55.062
But, um, after that,
I kind of slowed down a little bit.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.313
[Grant]
<i>And it's very exciting</i>

30:56.397 --> 30:59.024
<i>when you see kids realize</i>
<i>how much power they have,</i>

30:59.107 --> 31:03.195
where kids really acknowledge that,
"Wow, we can do something differently.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.072
We don't have to follow that trajectory

31:05.155 --> 31:08.992
and develop diabetes and heart disease
by the time we're 25.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.661
We can have a different future."

31:10.745 --> 31:13.955
<i>It's really lifting them up and saying, </i>
<i>"You have the power to make a difference.</i>

31:14.039 --> 31:17.752
<i>You can vote with your fork.</i>
<i>You can very shortly vote with your vote.</i>

31:17.835 --> 31:21.422
<i>And theres things that you can do.</i>
<i>Let's talk about what those things are."</i>

31:23.800 --> 31:25.551
You guys were great. Thank you.

31:28.388 --> 31:30.515
[Kass]
<i>What I've seen everywhere I've gone,</i>

31:30.598 --> 31:32.933
<i>and in the garden with the First Lady,</i>
<i>and in schools,</i>

31:33.016 --> 31:35.686
that if you just let kids
be a little bit engaged

31:35.770 --> 31:38.230
in the decision making process,
they take ownership.

31:38.313 --> 31:41.776
Be it, let a kid pick out three vegetables
in the grocery store,

31:41.859 --> 31:46.238
or have a child help you cook,
or anything in that realm,

31:46.321 --> 31:47.948
they really take ownership.

31:48.031 --> 31:51.076
And we saw kids stuffing their faces
with raw vegetables

31:51.159 --> 31:53.788
only because they planted it.
No other reason.

31:53.871 --> 31:57.916
And to find those little moments
across a kid's life

31:57.999 --> 32:00.795
that they can have those touches

32:00.878 --> 32:04.632
and feeling of empowerment and ownership,
transormational.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.343
[Cross]
<i>In my previous film,</i>

32:08.428 --> 32:11.388
<i>I had the opportunity to talk </i>
<i>to a wonderful family.</i>

32:11.472 --> 32:13.974
<i>Little Delani and Elise were charmers.</i>

32:14.057 --> 32:16.644
<i>They had an unbelievable story to tell me</i>

32:16.727 --> 32:19.354
<i>of how late one night</i>
<i>after a day of travel,</i>

32:19.439 --> 32:22.315
<i>Mum wanted to stop</i>
<i>at the only place that was open,</i>

32:22.399 --> 32:23.818
<i>a fast food restaurant,</i>

32:23.901 --> 32:25.277
<i>and little Delani said...</i>

32:25.360 --> 32:27.655
I told her, "No, I don't wanna go there,

32:27.738 --> 32:29.657
'cause they have junk food

32:29.740 --> 32:32.242
that, like, it's not good
for you and your body."

32:32.325 --> 32:35.036
We came back from our trip.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.708
It's 11:00 at night.
We'd been traveling on a plane for hours,

32:38.791 --> 32:41.209
and it was the only thing open,
the drive-through,

32:41.293 --> 32:44.254
and they were like,
"Please, don't feed us this food.

32:44.337 --> 32:45.380
Don't feed it to us."

32:45.465 --> 32:50.343
I said, "What about French fries
or a burger? Just a few fries?

32:50.427 --> 32:52.137
Just to have something in your tummy?"

32:52.220 --> 32:56.141
"No, Mommy, we don't want that food.
We learned so many nasty things about it."

32:56.224 --> 32:59.479
It's because of Delani
that I eat healthier.

32:59.562 --> 33:02.940
When she started bringing recipes home
to make a smoothie...

33:03.023 --> 33:06.527
Like, every single day, "Please, Mommy,
buy the ingredients. Please."

33:06.611 --> 33:07.945
To me, that was sort of a sign.

33:08.028 --> 33:10.405
If my four-year-old, at the time,
is coming home

33:10.490 --> 33:13.534
handing me recipes to eat healthier,

33:13.618 --> 33:15.368
I'm gonna do it.

33:15.452 --> 33:16.537
[Cross]
Where did that come from?

33:16.621 --> 33:18.163
It came from my sister.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.540
[Cross]
Oh, really?

33:19.624 --> 33:21.166
Okay, so, now the truth comes out.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.084
[Cross] Do you wanna tell me
what the story was, Elise?

33:23.168 --> 33:25.713
Yeah. I learned it in Wellness.

33:25.796 --> 33:28.966
[Cross] <i>These little girls' attitudes</i>
<i>impressed me so much</i>

33:29.049 --> 33:31.844
<i>that when it came time</i>
<i>to work on this project,</i>

33:31.928 --> 33:33.638
<i>I revisited their story</i>

33:33.721 --> 33:36.139
<i>and learned there was even more to it.</i>

33:36.223 --> 33:39.226
<i>The program</i>
<i>where Elise learned this information</i>

33:39.309 --> 33:42.395
<i>actually began well before Elise's time.</i>

33:42.479 --> 33:44.397
<i>Local teacher, Ginny Reale,</i>

33:44.481 --> 33:48.569
<i>first tried out a Wellness Week</i>
<i>in her classroom back in 2005.</i>

33:48.653 --> 33:51.446
So which color do you think

33:51.531 --> 33:55.952
we should be eating a lot of every day?

33:56.034 --> 33:58.286
Don't tell me purple.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.580
-Green.
-Green. You're right.

33:59.664 --> 34:01.707
[Cross]
<i>This is Ruby and Cailyn.</i>

34:01.791 --> 34:03.584
<i>They were in that first class</i>

34:03.668 --> 34:06.546
<i>when Mrs. Reale began to teach </i>
<i>about wellness.</i>

34:06.629 --> 34:10.215
<i>Now, 23 years old,</i>
<i>Ruby and Cailyn can reflect</i>

34:10.297 --> 34:13.719
<i>on how much of an impact</i>
<i>a teacher can really make.</i>

34:13.803 --> 34:16.346
Mrs. Reale was kind of
rounding up the troops

34:16.429 --> 34:17.974
at East Hampton Middle School.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.809
<i>She started the Wellness Run.</i>

34:19.891 --> 34:22.476
Teaching us more about nutrition,
getting us more active.

34:22.562 --> 34:25.230
<i>And then they brought in</i>
Super Size Me, <i>the documentary,</i>

34:25.313 --> 34:27.107
<i>for the students to watch.</i>

34:27.190 --> 34:29.610
<i>And I personally can remember watching,</i>

34:29.694 --> 34:31.235
<i>and it was just so vivid.</i>

34:31.319 --> 34:33.112
[Morgan Spurlock]
So nasty. [belches]

34:33.196 --> 34:35.866
[Ruby]
<i>What happened to Morgan was so dramatic,</i>

34:35.949 --> 34:37.909
<i>and I remember being like, "Oh, my gosh!</i>

34:37.994 --> 34:39.996
<i>I'm never eating McDonald's again."</i>

34:41.746 --> 34:45.166
[Cross] <i>Ginny was as surprised as anyone</i>
<i>when the first class began</i>

34:45.250 --> 34:49.170
<i>to analyze the nutritional value</i>
<i>of their school lunches,</i>

34:49.254 --> 34:52.592
<i>but no one was surprised</i>
<i>when they came up short.</i>

34:52.675 --> 34:56.469
I felt very confused
by the fact that we were--

34:56.553 --> 34:59.180
Here we were learning
about healthy choices,

34:59.264 --> 35:00.975
and maybe going home
and telling our parents,

35:01.058 --> 35:05.688
"This is what we wanna eat.
We want better food choices."

35:05.771 --> 35:09.942
But that not being translated
into our actual school options.

35:10.026 --> 35:13.445
And so, I think it just
really was a conversation,

35:13.528 --> 35:15.781
and we brought it up
in health class with Ms. Reale.

35:15.865 --> 35:17.867
[Cross]
<i>The kids then came up with a plan</i>

35:17.950 --> 35:22.079
<i>to get the administration to improve</i>
<i>those under-performing school lunches,</i>

35:22.162 --> 35:24.122
<i>a boycott.</i>

35:24.205 --> 35:25.875
[all gasping]

35:25.958 --> 35:28.669
[Ruby] <i>Ms. Reale empowered us</i>
<i>so much with these ideas</i>

35:28.753 --> 35:32.422
<i>that food was important,</i>
<i>and that we could make these decisions.</i>

35:32.505 --> 35:34.717
We were rebelling in a positive way.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.594
[News Anchor]
<i>You might find this hard to digest,</i>

35:37.678 --> 35:41.724
<i>but middle school students</i>
<i>in East Hampton are turning their backs</i>

35:41.807 --> 35:44.685
<i>on staples like pizza and burgers.</i>

35:44.769 --> 35:47.520
I never knew it could
affect my body that bad.

35:47.604 --> 35:49.606
Like, I knew something was going on,

35:49.690 --> 35:53.110
but nothing that bad and gross inside.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.528
[News Anchor]
<i>So a group of kids staged a boycott</i>

35:55.612 --> 35:58.615
<i>and just said no to cafeteria food.</i>

35:58.699 --> 36:00.785
We want fruit. We want vegetables.

36:00.868 --> 36:02.912
We want all the things
you're telling us to eat.

36:02.995 --> 36:06.123
[Cross] <i>The outcome of the boycott</i>
<i>was a lunchroom cooler</i>

36:06.206 --> 36:08.918
<i>that would contain healthy options </i>
<i>for the kids.</i>

36:09.001 --> 36:10.836
An anonymous donor...

36:10.920 --> 36:13.047
Donor, yeah, donated the money
that we needed for the cooler.

36:13.130 --> 36:14.674
[Cross]
<i>That donor was Doug Mercer,</i>

36:14.757 --> 36:18.218
<i>a local resident</i>
<i>who was so inspired by the kids' actions</i>

36:18.301 --> 36:22.098
<i>that he put his hand in his own pocket</i>
<i>and paid for that cooler.</i>

36:22.180 --> 36:25.225
Wonderful article in our local
<i>East Hampton Star</i> paper

36:25.308 --> 36:28.938

boycotting the unhealthy food

36:29.021 --> 36:31.439

<i>And I said, if these kids</i>
<i>can stand up for their health,</i>

36:35.485 --> 36:39.322
<i>I told them that I would buy</i>
<i>the refrigerator case that they needed.</i>

36:41.117 --> 36:42.659

<i>Once the refrigerator came in,</i>

<i>yogurt parfaits, and nice salads,</i>

<i>You had more energy.</i>

36:55.089 --> 36:58.008
<i>That must have been so empowering for us,</i>

36:58.092 --> 36:59.051
because we were kids,

36:59.135 --> 37:02.387
and how often do you get
taken seriously by adults?

39:22.610 --> 39:26.364

<i>to who are the advertisers,</i>

39:26.447 --> 39:27.867
<i>who are the athletes endorsing</i>

39:27.950 --> 39:30.244
<i>this fast food company </i>
<i>or that soda company?</i>

39:32.121 --> 39:33.873
All right, quiet on the set.

39:33.956 --> 39:36.959
<i>For us to be pushing nutrition education</i>
<i>and healthy eating habits</i>

39:37.042 --> 39:39.836
<i>through entertainment,</i>
<i>through the school system,</i>

39:39.920 --> 39:41.922
that can really penetrate the market

39:42.006 --> 39:44.757
and make a dent in this food fight.

39:44.841 --> 39:47.344
-So good.
-That was so good.

39:47.427 --> 39:48.761
Well done!

39:48.845 --> 39:50.890
How much impact is this social media,

39:50.973 --> 39:53.516
this YouTube media, this digital media,

39:53.600 --> 39:56.312
<i>is that having, you think,</i>
<i>on this cultural change?</i>

39:56.394 --> 39:59.814
[Kass] <i>You know, food is the number one </i>
<i>shared thing on Instagram.</i>

39:59.899 --> 40:01.233
<i>Everybody tweets their food,</i>

40:01.317 --> 40:04.194
<i>Instagrams their food, </i>
<i>Pinterests their food.</i>

40:04.278 --> 40:06.863
<i>And that is an expression</i>
<i>of what we represent as a culture,</i>

40:06.947 --> 40:08.949
<i>what people want to share.</i>

40:09.033 --> 40:12.452
That helps make
this cultural shift happen even faster.

40:12.535 --> 40:15.872
<i>The power of what Sprowtz are doing </i>
<i>and others are saying,</i>

40:15.956 --> 40:19.417
<i>we're gonna create</i>
<i>really awesome superhero characters,</i>

40:19.500 --> 40:21.295
<i>and make it fun for kids,</i>

40:21.378 --> 40:23.504
<i>make it an ideal</i>
<i>that they wanna aspire to,</i>

40:23.588 --> 40:26.424
<i>and use that same power for good food</i>

40:26.507 --> 40:29.178
<i>as, you know, junk food companies</i>
<i>are using for junk.</i>

40:29.261 --> 40:30.678
<i>And that's how you're gonna win the war.</i>

40:30.762 --> 40:32.430
<i>We did a partnership with </i> Sesame Street

40:32.513 --> 40:35.850
<i>to put </i> Sesame Street <i> characters</i>
<i>on fruits and vegetables, on produce.</i>

40:35.935 --> 40:36.809
[laughing]

40:36.893 --> 40:38.811
[Kass] <i>For companies who have done it</i>
<i>over three quarters,</i>

40:38.895 --> 40:40.189
<i>it's over 5% increase in sales.</i>

40:40.272 --> 40:42.316
<i>Because they've got an Elmo on it.</i>

40:42.399 --> 40:43.816
So these companies
are starting to step up,

40:43.900 --> 40:45.402
and it has a transformative impact.

40:45.485 --> 40:49.656
[Colby Carrot] <i>My mission is to make sure</i>
<i>that kids everywhere get the message</i>

40:49.739 --> 40:52.952

40:53.035 --> 40:54.494
<i>You know, we go out into the world,</i>

40:54.577 --> 40:56.621
<i>and the kids see us,</i>
<i>and they just go nuts.</i>

40:56.704 --> 40:58.498
It's very satisfying,
very rewarding to know

40:58.581 --> 41:00.458
that something you're doing
is making a difference,

41:00.541 --> 41:02.086
a real difference, in kids' lives.

41:09.051 --> 41:10.593
You could serve it right from the pan,

41:10.677 --> 41:12.512
but we'll just transfer it
to this pretty serving bowl

41:12.595 --> 41:13.763
'cause it's such a pretty color.

41:13.846 --> 41:15.265
-[Audience] Ooh!
-[Rachael Ray] I know.

41:15.349 --> 41:18.893
This g-free dinner.
You're never gonna miss the gluten.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.651
-[Cross] Hey, Rachael.
-Hi. How are you?

41:26.734 --> 41:27.777
Hi, fellas.

41:27.860 --> 41:31.365
So, Rachael, how did you first
get excited and get involved in food?

41:31.448 --> 41:33.616
My grandpa lived with us
when I was very little,

41:33.700 --> 41:36.120
and, um, he was my best friend.
He was my caretaker,

41:36.203 --> 41:39.622
so I grew up with the diet
of a 70-something Sicilian man.

41:39.706 --> 41:42.583
It's just always what I wanted
to do for a living.

41:42.667 --> 41:46.088
I like the way
sharing food with people makes me feel.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.589
I love kale! I grew up with it as a kid.

41:48.673 --> 41:51.801
We always used it in cooking
in our family, in our house.

41:51.884 --> 41:54.762
<i>The way I was raised</i>
<i>improved the quality of my life.</i>

41:54.846 --> 41:57.598
Because I knew I could take
very little money and very little food

41:57.682 --> 41:59.435
and take care of myself.

41:59.517 --> 42:03.147
Parents put broccoli. They put asparagus.
They put the kale.

42:03.230 --> 42:06.691
They put it on the table,
and the kids don't eat it.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.277
And they get discouraged,

42:08.360 --> 42:11.529
because their kids want,
you know, peanut butter and toast,

42:11.612 --> 42:14.283
or they want pizza or what else.

42:14.366 --> 42:16.035
Do you got any advice
or any sort of ideas--

42:16.118 --> 42:19.163
Yeah, give them pizza
with kale underneath the cheese.

42:19.246 --> 42:21.664
I mean, you have to make
the food that's good for you

42:21.748 --> 42:24.376
as appealing as the food
that's not so good for you.

42:24.460 --> 42:28.505
If you just put a big bowl of broccoli
on the table by itself,

42:28.588 --> 42:30.049
-I'd blow you off too.
-No fun in that.

42:30.132 --> 42:31.883
I'd be like, "That's not fun."

42:31.966 --> 42:35.595
<i>But if it's pizza they love,</i>
<i>you can put anything on a pizza.</i>

42:35.678 --> 42:38.639
<i>Here's the pizza bread.</i>
<i>Here's the vegetables. There's the cheese.</i>

42:38.723 --> 42:41.809
<i>If they want the pizza, they gotta eat it.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

42:41.893 --> 42:43.686
You just put it with something they love.

42:43.770 --> 42:45.272
And if they're really snotty...

42:45.355 --> 42:48.067
Like, my niece went through the phase,
"What's in that?"

42:48.150 --> 42:50.194
And I just got annoyed with her.

42:50.277 --> 42:53.363
I'm like, "Boogers. Big, fat boogers."

42:53.447 --> 42:54.989
It's all things in moderation.

42:55.074 --> 42:56.325
100% couldn't agree more.

42:56.408 --> 42:58.910
And if you're a morbidly obese child,

42:58.993 --> 43:00.454
it's because you're eating processed food.

43:00.537 --> 43:01.996
-It's not because you're eating food.
-Yeah.

43:02.081 --> 43:03.664
Whole food is whole food.

43:03.748 --> 43:05.084
And it's good for you.

43:05.167 --> 43:06.793
You have to get your family moving more,

43:06.876 --> 43:09.088
and you have to give them
less processed food and less sugar.

43:09.171 --> 43:11.714
-So is that why you started Yum-o?
-Of course.

43:11.798 --> 43:15.094
<i>I believe the reason children, </i>
<i>all children, should work with food</i>

43:15.177 --> 43:17.096
<i>is that it improves their self-esteem,</i>

43:17.179 --> 43:20.099
<i>and it improves the quality</i>
<i>of the rest of their lives.</i>

43:20.182 --> 43:23.768
<i>We spend about a third of our money</i>
<i>on scholarship programs</i>

43:23.851 --> 43:27.021
<i>for public school kids who want </i>
<i>to go into any food-related field.</i>

43:27.106 --> 43:31.151
<i>We spend about a third of our dollars</i>
<i>on lobbying and improving school food.</i>

43:31.235 --> 43:32.528
<i>And we spend a third of our money</i>

43:32.610 --> 43:35.863
<i>on simply relieving hunger</i>
<i>among American children.</i>

43:35.947 --> 43:40.452
But, you know, anybody can go in
and offer assistance to their community.

43:40.536 --> 43:43.955
One service person can go in
and teach children about nutrition.

43:44.038 --> 43:45.832
They don't have to have a special license.

43:45.915 --> 43:48.210
They can go in and plant a garden.

43:48.293 --> 43:51.338
They can go in
and just teach basic cooking skills.

43:51.421 --> 43:54.882
All you have to do is involve people
in their communities.

43:54.966 --> 43:58.345
Getting grassroots
about where their food comes from,

43:58.428 --> 44:01.306
and trying to improve the quality
of school food outside the system.

44:01.390 --> 44:05.269
You guys wanna walk this way a little bit
just so you can hear me?

44:05.352 --> 44:07.437

I do hands-on lessons on gardening.

44:25.705 --> 44:27.416

44:51.481 --> 44:54.318
[Cross] <i>Starting with food activism</i>
<i>on the college campus,</i>

44:54.401 --> 44:56.445

-It's not very good.

45:03.034 --> 45:04.785

<i>and then connecting them</i>
<i>with schools around the country</i>

45:14.045 --> 45:18.217
<i>to build and lead</i>
<i>lasting school garden programs.</i>

45:18.300 --> 45:21.220
Each of those Corps members
spends a year or two

45:21.303 --> 45:24.722
serving a high-need school
or a series of high-need schools.

45:24.805 --> 45:27.392
<i>Our Corps members</i>
<i>build and tend school gardens,</i>

45:30.061 --> 45:31.771
<i>and principals, and community members</i>

45:31.854 --> 45:34.358
<i>in taking ownership over that garden</i>
<i>over the long term.</i>

45:34.441 --> 45:35.651
The first thing we're gonna do

45:35.733 --> 45:38.110
is a plant part scavenger hunt
in the garden.

45:38.194 --> 45:40.821
So, you guys learned
about plant parts, right, this year?

45:40.905 --> 45:43.283
-Yeah.
-So who could tell me a plant part?

45:43.367 --> 45:44.493
Uh, yeah.

45:44.576 --> 45:46.286
-A root.
-Root. Awesome.

45:46.370 --> 45:48.372
Could anyone name
another part of the plant?

45:48.455 --> 45:49.789
-What do you think?
-Leaf.

45:49.872 --> 45:51.291
Leaves. Perfect!

45:51.375 --> 45:52.626
They get sunlight.

45:52.709 --> 45:55.127
They do. All that photosynthesis.
Very good.

45:55.211 --> 45:58.674
There are 100,000 public schools
in this country,

45:58.756 --> 46:02.009
and we need to find a way
to connect kids to healthy food

46:02.093 --> 46:04.388
in each of those 100,000 schools.

46:06.138 --> 46:08.433
<i>Now, FoodCorps have </i>
<i>our couple hundred Corps members</i>

46:08.517 --> 46:09.809
<i>out in the field right now.</i>

46:09.892 --> 46:12.103
<i>We can't be in each of those schools.</i>

46:12.186 --> 46:15.607
<i>So, our job is</i>
<i>to create a model that works</i>

46:15.691 --> 46:18.694
<i>and encourage other folks</i>
<i>to help us scale it up.</i>

46:20.487 --> 46:23.657
Anybody who has grown a garden
with a child knows

46:23.740 --> 46:25.450
that gardens are magic,

46:25.534 --> 46:28.869
<i>and if you can tap in</i>
<i>to that potential of a school garden,</i>

46:28.953 --> 46:31.373
<i>you can make change</i>
<i>in the life of the kids.</i>

46:31.456 --> 46:34.125
I like being dirty.

-Me too.

<i>My favorite childhood memories</i>

46:37.546 --> 46:42.049
<i>are of the times I was able</i>
<i>to water my dad's tomatoes in his garden.</i>

46:42.133 --> 46:46.262
There's no doubt I learned
to fall in love with food in that garden.

46:48.097 --> 46:49.641
[Quilty]
<i>They're so excited about gardening,</i>

46:49.725 --> 46:51.267

46:51.351 --> 46:52.728
<i>They're excited to come weed the plants.</i>

46:52.810 --> 46:54.186
<i>They're excited to pick the plants.</i>

46:54.270 --> 46:55.980
<i>They're excited to taste the plants.</i>

46:57.148 --> 46:59.401
So this is what we're gonna do.
The cool thing about kale

46:59.484 --> 47:01.068
is after you pick it,
it's gonna keep growing.

47:01.152 --> 47:04.196
Just use both hands
and kind of pinch it just like that.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.491
Okay? And everyone
just gets one, all right?

47:41.610 --> 47:45.655
[Quilty] <i>And the kids are just so willing </i>

you're gonna pick them off the stem there.

47:58.585 --> 48:00.587
Gonna do half a cup of yogurt.

48:00.670 --> 48:03.632
Now, just open that up,
and you can spoon it.

48:03.715 --> 48:05.509
Dump that. Wait for the kale.

48:05.592 --> 48:07.051
Good. Use the spoon.

He's excited about making his own food.

48:42.754 --> 48:45.297
Like, he's trying to get us
to grow a garden at home now.

48:45.381 --> 48:46.215
But it's so cool,

48:46.298 --> 48:48.175
because his older brothers
never had this experience,

48:48.259 --> 48:49.761
and he's learned so much from them.

48:49.845 --> 48:53.013
But now, he can teach them
about things he's learning here,

48:53.097 --> 48:55.391
about foods, and, you know, planting,

48:55.475 --> 48:57.143
and growing, and picking, and making.

48:57.226 --> 49:00.938
Part of the challenge is that
parts of the country struggle with issues

49:01.021 --> 49:03.023
around access
and affordability of healthy food.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.861
It's not the desire,
but there are some barriers

49:05.943 --> 49:08.738
to people being able
to live a healthier life

49:08.822 --> 49:10.156
and being able to make changes.

49:10.239 --> 49:12.701
<i>If it's not easy for families,</i>
<i>they're gonna fail.</i>

49:12.784 --> 49:16.287
So, we have to make it easier for them
to make healthier choices.

49:16.370 --> 49:17.873
I think that's at the crux of the work.

49:19.081 --> 49:22.836
[Cross] <i>One group trying to improve</i>
<i>affordability of fresh produce</i>

49:22.919 --> 49:25.630
<i>for lower-income families</i>
<i>is Wholesome Wave.</i>

49:25.714 --> 49:29.468
<i>Its founder, Michel Nischan,</i>
<i>is a celebrity chef from New York City</i>

49:29.551 --> 49:33.722
<i>who now devotes his life</i>
<i>to helping struggling families eat better.</i>

49:33.805 --> 49:36.600
<i>I wanted to find out</i>
<i>why he left the restaurant world</i>

49:36.683 --> 49:41.103
<i>in order to help improve access</i>
<i>to healthy food for families in need.</i>

49:41.187 --> 49:42.939
This is the smell...

49:44.273 --> 49:45.817
of a perfectly cooked frittata.

49:47.652 --> 49:50.196
[Michel Nischan] <i>I had a restaurant </i>
<i>I owned called Heartbeat,</i>

49:50.279 --> 49:53.700
and it was a restaurant
of local, organic, sustainable cuisine,

49:53.783 --> 49:55.869
but no processed food of any kind.

49:55.952 --> 49:57.453
And I was feeling really good
about myself.

49:58.245 --> 50:02.667
<i>But here I was in a restaurant,</i>
<i>providing healthy food</i>

50:02.751 --> 50:05.879
<i>for people that could afford</i>
<i>to spend $40 on an entree.</i>

50:06.963 --> 50:11.425
<i>At age five, my son Chris was diagnosed</i>
<i>with type 1 diabetes,</i>

50:11.510 --> 50:16.013
<i>and that's where I made the connection</i>
<i>between food and human health.</i>

50:16.096 --> 50:18.224
<i>And then I learned about type 2 diabetes,</i>

50:18.307 --> 50:21.060
<i>that most people that suffer from it</i>
<i>don't have an income</i>

50:21.143 --> 50:24.689
that allows them to buy the food
that can prevent this horrible disease.

50:24.773 --> 50:27.149
So I just... I couldn't reconcile that.

50:28.234 --> 50:29.945
<i>So we founded Wholesome Wave </i>
<i>to figure out </i>

50:30.027 --> 50:33.364
<i>what are some commonsense ways</i>
<i>that we can demonstrate</i>

50:33.447 --> 50:36.660
<i>that people struggling with poverty</i>
<i>really wanna feed their families well.</i>

50:36.743 --> 50:39.829
<i>They would make better food choices</i>
<i>if they could afford it.</i>

50:39.913 --> 50:44.166
So we just said, "Let's create two-for-one
fruit and vegetable sales."

50:44.250 --> 50:47.461
<i>So we started raising private money</i>
<i>to double the value of food stamps.</i>

50:49.505 --> 50:51.090
<i>And it's turned in to such a huge thing.</i>

50:51.173 --> 50:55.887
<i>I got such great reception</i>
<i>from consumers struggling with poverty,</i>

50:55.971 --> 50:58.890
<i>and the farmers, and the markets,</i>
<i>and the local policymakers.</i>

51:00.516 --> 51:02.644
When we started our programs in 2008,

51:02.727 --> 51:05.647
less than 100 farmers' markets
accepted food stamps.

51:05.730 --> 51:09.734
<i>Today, 6,600 of the 8,800</i>
<i>accept food stamps.</i>

51:10.819 --> 51:12.194
So, Michel, you've also created

51:12.278 --> 51:14.781
this Fruit and Vegetable
Prescription Program.

51:14.864 --> 51:16.741
What's that, mate?

51:16.825 --> 51:20.369
[Nischan] <i>So, a patient who is at risk of </i>
<i>a diet-related disease goes to a doctor.</i>

51:20.452 --> 51:23.623
<i>The doctor says, "Yep, you're at risk."</i>
<i>Gives them a prescription.</i>

51:23.707 --> 51:25.959
<i>Tells them to increase </i>
<i>their fruit and vegetable consumption </i>

51:26.042 --> 51:27.043
<i>a serving per day.</i>

51:27.126 --> 51:30.546
<i>And the whole family participates,</i>
<i>so the patient is not in isolation.</i>

51:30.630 --> 51:31.923
<i>So they go the farmers' market,</i>

51:32.007 --> 51:34.550
<i>exchange the prescription</i>
<i>for free fruits and vegetables,</i>

51:34.634 --> 51:36.343
<i>eat more fruits and vegetables,</i>

51:36.427 --> 51:37.929
<i>then go back monthly to be measured</i>

51:38.013 --> 51:39.806
<i>for their health outcomes </i>
<i>and their progress,</i>

51:39.889 --> 51:41.641
<i>and then they get a refill</i>
<i>for their prescription.</i>

51:41.725 --> 51:43.727
So doctors, who are often frustrated

51:43.810 --> 51:46.186
because all they can do
is advise a low-income consumer

51:46.270 --> 51:48.023
that they should be making
healthier food choices,

51:48.105 --> 51:50.399
<i>can actually give that advice.</i>

51:50.482 --> 51:53.695
<i>And then the prescription</i>
<i>actually allows that consumer</i>

51:53.778 --> 51:57.197
<i>to get the free fresh fruits</i>
<i>and vegetables they need.</i>

51:57.281 --> 52:01.160
<i>We use exactly the same infrastructure</i>
<i>of the prescription system,</i>

52:01.243 --> 52:03.955
but we're investing in food
in the front end

52:04.039 --> 52:07.834
instead of paying for medicine for life,
because now, it's too late.

52:08.918 --> 52:11.796
[Cross] <i>One of the doctors who signed up </i>
<i>to work with Wholesome Wave</i>

52:11.880 --> 52:15.507
<i>is Dr. Periasamy at the Harlem Hospital.</i>

52:15.591 --> 52:18.177
Here you are, a doctor
at the hospital here in Harlem,

52:18.260 --> 52:21.848
writing a prescription, saying,
"Go and get some fruits and vegetables."

52:21.931 --> 52:24.976
Initially, all these years,
I'm, like, telling them,

52:25.060 --> 52:26.019
"You have to eat healthy.

52:26.102 --> 52:28.187
You have to exercise.
You have to lose weight."

52:28.270 --> 52:31.190
And they didn't take me seriously.

52:31.273 --> 52:32.274
And then they said,

52:32.358 --> 52:36.195
"All these years, you told me,
but I couldn't afford it,

52:36.278 --> 52:38.197
so that is why I could not do it.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.741
Now, I will be able to do it.

52:39.824 --> 52:42.284
I am going to make an attempt to do this."

52:42.368 --> 52:44.578
They even call me...
"You're the fruit lady."

52:44.663 --> 52:47.707
So I'm so happy.
I'm the fruit lady of Harlem.

52:47.791 --> 52:50.167
[Cross] <i>One family</i>
<i>that works with Dr. Periasamy</i>

52:50.250 --> 52:52.503
<i>is Sheryl and her daughter, Alaijah.</i>

52:52.586 --> 52:56.382
<i>They have been on the Fruit and Veggie </i>
<i>Prescription Program for three years,</i>

52:56.465 --> 52:58.300
<i>and they both couldn't be happier.</i>

52:58.384 --> 53:01.721
Alaijah started the program
almost three years ago,

53:01.805 --> 53:03.723
severely asthmatic.

53:03.807 --> 53:05.349
She was overweight.

53:05.432 --> 53:07.309
A lot of difficulty with breathing.

53:07.393 --> 53:09.020
What was her diet like back then?

53:09.104 --> 53:12.899
Um, pretty much whatever she felt
like eating is what she ate.

53:12.982 --> 53:15.985
So, we ate a lot of fast food at the time.

53:16.069 --> 53:18.947
<i>A lot of things</i>
<i>that probably were not the healthiest.</i>

53:19.030 --> 53:20.699
<i>As a kid, I ate McDonald's,</i>
<i>so it was kind of like,</i>

53:20.782 --> 53:23.367
<i>"Well, I mean, I'm okay, so she's okay."</i>

53:23.450 --> 53:25.369
And not really understanding

53:25.452 --> 53:27.831
how much the diet impacted
her actual health.

53:29.581 --> 53:31.583
[Cross] <i>You were prescribed </i>
<i>fruits and vegetables, right?</i>

53:31.667 --> 53:32.501
[Sheryl] <i>Yes.</i>

53:32.584 --> 53:34.713
[Cross] <i> Like, it wasn't medicine</i>
<i>or prescription drugs.</i>

53:34.796 --> 53:36.965
-Did that seem weird to you?
-Yes, it was.

53:37.048 --> 53:38.007
And actually, to me,

53:38.091 --> 53:40.634
I thought, you know, doctors
just like to give you medicine.

53:40.719 --> 53:41.593
So, it was different.

53:41.677 --> 53:43.637
It was like, "Okay, well,
this is not medicine.

53:43.722 --> 53:45.140
Let's see how this works out."

53:46.808 --> 53:48.184
[Cross] <i>Now, what was the experience like</i>

53:48.267 --> 53:50.644
<i>taking your daughter</i>
<i>to the farmers' market?</i>

53:50.729 --> 53:53.064
[Sheryl] <i>Um, she actually liked</i>
<i>speaking with the farmers.</i>

53:53.148 --> 53:54.231
<i>She liked the colors,</i>

53:54.314 --> 53:56.483
<i>and some of the things were different </i>
<i>from what she was used to.</i>

53:56.567 --> 53:58.652
<i>So, there were actually</i>
<i>purple string beans one year.</i>

53:58.737 --> 54:00.571
<i>She was like,</i>
<i>"Mommy, how are they purple?"</i>

54:00.654 --> 54:02.698
<i>"Ask the farmers. They'll tell you."</i>

54:02.782 --> 54:06.243
<i>And she talked about how do things grow.</i>
<i>And how do you know what's fresh?</i>

54:06.326 --> 54:09.455
<i>I think learning those things</i>
<i>made it more fun for her to eat them.</i>

54:09.538 --> 54:12.374
The biggest impact is that
her health is way better.

54:12.458 --> 54:16.045
Like, she has not used any steroids
for her asthma in three years.

54:16.129 --> 54:18.214
-Wow.
-Not at all.

54:18.297 --> 54:21.176
[Sheryl] <i> I think that</i>
<i>just the thought of taking your kid</i>

54:21.258 --> 54:22.426
<i>to actually speak with the farmers.</i>

54:22.509 --> 54:25.304
<i>Because they really are very friendly,</i>
<i>and they do speak with your kids.</i>

54:25.387 --> 54:27.556
<i>Let them talk to the farmers.</i>
<i>Let them learn about the things,</i>

54:27.639 --> 54:29.641
<i>and I promise</i>
<i>they'll probably be more likely</i>

54:29.725 --> 54:32.020
<i>to like things that they told you</i>
<i>they didn't like as well.</i>

54:32.103 --> 54:33.897
My kids eat squash. They eat kale.

54:33.980 --> 54:35.106
And they like it.

54:35.190 --> 54:36.732
So, I think it's a big difference.

we have to make the healthy choice
the easy choice, period.

<i>Today she's taking Michael</i>
<i>and his mum to a supermarket.</i>

58:32.093 --> 58:35.054
<i>Part of what she teaches</i>
<i>is how to empower kids</i>

58:35.138 --> 58:37.597
<i>to take control of their own food choices</i>

58:37.681 --> 58:39.350

[Leslie Anders] <i>I do take my clients</i>

58:51.446 --> 58:54.032
<i>I hope it opens Michael's eyes</i>

58:58.244 --> 59:00.996
of trying some new things
as he gets older.

59:01.080 --> 59:05.625
I'd rather they get plain cereal
and add their own sugar, or honey, or...

59:05.709 --> 59:09.464
You know, have them add honey,
or maple syrup, or sugar.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.673
And you know, with the idea
that you don't pour it on.

The sugar is much lower.
At least only eight.

You wanna read the label?

59:41.204 --> 59:42.788
A little bit high on the sugar.

59:46.417 --> 59:47.876
This one has more protein.

[Cross] <i>Even learning how and when</i>

[label printing]

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:18.073

If most days, you're getting
a good and balanced meal

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.265
with whole grains
and lots of fruits and vegetables,

01:00:42.348 --> 01:00:45.393
then having a burger
when the kids are at a friend's house,

01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:46.893
or pizza, or whatever, it doesn't matter.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:49.313
You don't have to worry about it.
We don't want to be overly obsessed.

01:00:49.397 --> 01:00:50.314
We just wanna make sure

01:00:50.398 --> 01:00:52.649
we're having balanced
day in and day out meals,

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:54.527
and then, you know,
you have some fun with it.

01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:56.404
Food is supposed to be fun.
It's supposed to be tasty.

01:00:56.487 --> 01:01:00.533
[Producer] What do you have
for after-school snack?

01:01:00.616 --> 01:01:02.117
After-school snack? Um...

01:01:02.201 --> 01:01:05.704
I will have probably banana bread

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:08.332
or sometimes Oreos.

01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:09.458
Well, whenever I got home,

01:01:09.542 --> 01:01:13.588
I used to eat like Goldfish,
cheese sticks,

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:14.796
stuff like that.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.008
But now, I usually try to take an apple,
and just that's it.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.885
We were having dinner,

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:23.222
and my dad was eating a pear.
I'm like, "What is that?"

01:01:23.306 --> 01:01:25.308
He's like, "It's a pear.
It tastes just like an apple."

01:01:25.391 --> 01:01:26.517
Like, "No."

01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:29.437
'Cause I don't really like
to try new foods that much.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.812
And he's like, "Come on. Just try it."

01:01:30.896 --> 01:01:32.398
I'm like... [reluctantly] "Fine."

01:01:33.399 --> 01:01:35.108
And then I bit into it.

01:01:35.193 --> 01:01:37.486
I ran to the other end of the kitchen.

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:38.778
I held it up in the air and said,

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:42.450
"I want this in my lunch
every single day!"

01:01:42.533 --> 01:01:45.244
And then I grabbed all of them
in the fridge and ran away.

01:01:45.328 --> 01:01:50.165
You should have
60% of vegetables on your plate

01:01:50.249 --> 01:01:52.709
instead of processed foods.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:56.214
And they said that we do that at my house.

01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.675
Don't go in the boxed aisles,

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:04.763
because it's basically killing children
that way.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:06.682
-[Producer] The processed foods?
-Yeah.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:10.353
It's packed full of sugar,

01:02:10.436 --> 01:02:12.521
and it's all disgusting.

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:17.192
So, mums and dads across the country
are listening to you,

01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:19.445
and they're saying, "You know what?
This Sam makes a lot of sense.

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:20.779
This all sounds good.

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:23.241
But what do I do?"

01:02:23.324 --> 01:02:24.950
Maybe give us a quick rundown

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:27.536
of how a breakfast, lunch,
and dinner can look on a weekend.

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:28.995
You know, breakfast, having some whole...

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:31.122
Making sure you're getting
some good whole grains at breakfast

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:32.874
and some fruit is a good goal there.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:36.044
Water... morning, noon,
and night is also...

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:37.505
If you just did one thing

01:02:37.588 --> 01:02:39.005
and make sure your kids are drinking water

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:41.925
and not sugary drinks,
you're well on your way.

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:43.218
-Huge improvement.
-Huge improvement.

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:46.096
-Is that Chewbacca?
-No.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:48.014
[Kass] <i> I would first say</i>

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.141
<i>having breakfast, lunch,</i>
<i>and dinner together</i>

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:52.769
is vitally important. Particularly dinner.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:55.314
If families eat together,
not only are their health outcomes better

01:02:55.398 --> 01:02:56.940
<i>in all the things we're looking for.</i>

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.985
<i>Fruit and vegetable consumption,</i>
<i>whole grain consumption goes up.</i>

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:01.820
<i>Sodium and calorie consumption goes down.</i>

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:03.863
<i>But also behavior.</i>

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:06.074
So having family meals
and cooking is, like,

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:07.410
one of the best things you can do.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.248
[McFadden Dad]
<i>There are so many choices out there</i>

01:03:13.332 --> 01:03:15.501
<i>in terms of what you can eat,</i>
<i>and what you can buy,</i>

01:03:15.584 --> 01:03:17.295
<i>and what you choose to eat.</i>

01:03:17.378 --> 01:03:21.424
<i>And, you know, being school teachers,</i>
<i>we see all of it at the lunch tables.</i>

01:03:21.507 --> 01:03:25.594
Everything from really well-made, healthy,
nutritious, fresh lunches

01:03:25.678 --> 01:03:28.723
that you can tell parents, you know,
put a lot energy into

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.600
<i>to just really packaged stuff</i>

01:03:31.684 --> 01:03:35.020
<i>that maybe was picked up</i>
<i>at 7-Eleven or the mini market</i>

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:36.605
<i>on the way to school that day.</i>

01:03:36.689 --> 01:03:38.607
[McFadden Mom]
<i>And their behavior is definitely affected</i>

01:03:38.691 --> 01:03:39.816
<i>by what you eat.</i>

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:42.778
<i>You see it both positively and negatively</i>

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:44.279
<i>with students in our class</i>

01:03:44.363 --> 01:03:48.617
as well as if our kids go
to a birthday party or something,

01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:50.786
and they eat what's available,

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:53.748
<i>they act differently</i>
<i>depending on what they eat.</i>

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:57.208
[McFadden Dad] <i>I definitely</i>
<i>had some packaged stuff when I was a kid.</i>

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:59.127
<i>The sugar and the candy tasted good.</i>

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:02.340
<i>It was a... I liked it a lot.</i>

01:04:02.423 --> 01:04:05.760
I remember being in school
and getting, like, pudding cups and stuff.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:09.054
And our kids don't even...
They've never even had a pudding cup.

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:12.307
There's this one right here.
Looks pretty darn good.

01:04:13.684 --> 01:04:15.185
[McFadden Mom]
<i>They love watching stuff grow.</i>

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:18.188
<i>The most incremental,</i>
<i>little growth, they notice.</i>

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:20.566
<i>Like, "There's a new tomato on the plant.</i>
<i>Can we eat it now?"</i>

01:04:20.649 --> 01:04:23.151
<i>They want it so badly.</i>

01:04:23.234 --> 01:04:24.944
[McFadden Dad] 
<i>Just like with the strawberries.</i>

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:29.367
They run back, and just the smiles.
Like, "There's one. Here's one."

01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:31.284
Yeah, when they find a worm in there.
All of it's cool.

01:04:31.369 --> 01:04:33.496
Just like the kids at school.
"Ooh, there's a worm!"

01:04:33.579 --> 01:04:35.121
-It's fun.
-It is fun.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:38.834
Here. Hold onto that.
You can be the lettuce holder.

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:40.251
Don't eat it yet. We gotta wash it off.

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:42.713
We're gonna put it
and add it to our salad, okay?

01:04:44.465 --> 01:04:46.425
That's fine. Hand it to your brother.

01:04:47.635 --> 01:04:50.261
[McFadden Mom]
<i>I think today with the Internet,</i>

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:55.100
<i>and so many great blogs, and Pinterest</i>
<i>to help me wanna try new recipes.</i>

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:57.018
<i>And then one will lead to another,</i>

01:04:57.102 --> 01:05:00.063
<i>and then you start buying</i>
<i>the cookbooks that go along with it,</i>

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:03.526
<i>and you get excited</i>
<i>just to try new things.</i>

01:05:03.609 --> 01:05:06.986
And to know, "Wow, I already have
those things in my kitchen,

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.615
why not try it in a different way?"

01:05:09.698 --> 01:05:12.158
Look at these big pieces

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.035
we can tear into smaller pieces

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.539
and drop them in the bowl.

01:05:16.622 --> 01:05:18.457
Look, just pick up one at a time.

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:20.917

-Yummy!
-How is it? It's good?

I like it.

[Cross]
<i>Doesn't it make sense, Sam,</i>

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:31.362
<i>that cooking should be</i>
<i>in every class in America?</i>

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:34.867
We have to figure out
how to teach kids the basic set of skills

that they can use
in lots of different ways.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:40.163

01:06:57.138 --> 01:06:59.767
[Cross]
<i>I'm back to visit with Brian Wansink,</i>

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:01.309
<i>who invited me to sit in</i>

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:05.021
<i>on a class in his department</i>
<i>at Cornell University.</i>

01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:07.023
I'm going back to school.

01:07:09.652 --> 01:07:12.571
<i>So, Brian, tell me what's going on </i>
<i>in the lab here today.</i>

01:07:12.655 --> 01:07:15.031
Well, one of the things that's going on
is that a lot of people believe

01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:19.369
that you cannot cook healthy meals
unless you have a lot of money.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:21.664
-I hear that a lot.
-Oh, all the time.

01:07:21.747 --> 01:07:23.081
"It's expensive to be healthy."

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:25.291
So what we're doing right now
is we've got people,

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:28.461
<i>they're cooking on a thrifty budget</i>
<i>that's about $2 per meal.</i>

01:07:28.546 --> 01:07:30.255
<i>We're showing them how to make it healthy.</i>

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.340
[Cross] <i>And what's the definition </i>
<i>of a healthy meal?</i>

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:34.300
[Wansink] <i>It's got the meat.</i>
<i>It's got the whole grains.</i>

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:36.679
<i>It's got the serving of vegetables</i>
<i>and a serving of fruit</i>

01:07:36.762 --> 01:07:38.973
<i>for about a buck and a half</i>
<i>to two dollars.</i>

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:41.725
<i>And these students here that we see,</i>

01:07:41.809 --> 01:07:43.059
<i>they don't have a lot of talent.</i>

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:45.103
<i>They've just had</i>
<i>a few lessons on how to cook.</i>

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:47.480
<i>What's gonna happen is you do this twice,</i>

01:07:47.565 --> 01:07:49.190
<i>you are tremendously empowered.</i>

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:51.735
<i>You realize that it's not money</i>
<i>that leads you to eat right.</i>

01:07:51.819 --> 01:07:53.152
<i>And it takes very little</i>

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:57.198
for a person to go from 0 to 60
in terms of cooking confidence.

01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:59.367
You learn how to make
five meals from scratch,

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:00.828
<i>then you think you can conquer the world,</i>

01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:03.789
<i>and that's what we're trying</i>
<i>to teach people here.</i>

01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:09.544
Okay so, Brian, we've got a lot of frozen,
packaged, green beans here.

01:08:09.628 --> 01:08:10.713
-Thoughts?
-Yeah.

01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:13.506
People say, "Fresh fruits and vegetables.
Only eat fresh fruits and vegetables."

01:08:13.591 --> 01:08:15.091
That's foolish.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:17.093
And in fact, people say,
"Oh, but frozen is so expensive."

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:20.014
It's not. By the time
you cut off the stock of the broccoli

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.724
and throw away the little leaflets,

01:08:21.807 --> 01:08:23.934
it's probably gonna be the same price
as buying frozen broccoli.

01:08:24.018 --> 01:08:26.937
And this ends up being
a lot easier and a lot quicker to make

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.689
if you're a person
who is complaining about time.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:30.024
The nutritional value?

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:33.027
As high or higher, because what happens is

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:36.947
when they cut this,
they cut this at the peak of its ripeness.

01:08:37.031 --> 01:08:39.407
The stuff that's fresh that you buy,

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:41.868
they cut before it's even ripe
in a lot of cases,

01:08:41.952 --> 01:08:43.202
and it ripens on the bus,

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:44.997
and it doesn't get
the same sort of nutrients.

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.165
So, Camille, tell me what's going on here.

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:50.126
Well, today we are having
students make their dinners.

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:52.420
I'm actually a teaching assistant
for the class.

01:08:52.502 --> 01:08:54.923
So Hope is one of the students,
and she is making her meal.

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:56.716
Okay, so why are you here?
What do you wanna learn?

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.636
I'm graduating,
so I wanted to learn how to cook

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.095
and cook on a budget.

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:03.765
So, everything we made
in this meal was for under $5.

01:09:03.849 --> 01:09:07.143
So this dinner portion
I'm cooking all costs about $1.30.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:08.854
[Cross] <i>Are you interested</i>
<i>in only saving money,</i>

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:10.270
<i>or are you interested in being healthy?</i>

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:12.273
Both. Mainly, being healthy,

01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:16.028
but the saving costs
was definitely an extra piece.

01:09:16.111 --> 01:09:18.113
[Cross] <i>And how is</i>
<i>the confidence level going</i>

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:20.531
<i>in terms of actually achieving</i>
<i>what you set out to do?</i>

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:21.908
[Hope]
<i>Much better.</i>

01:09:21.992 --> 01:09:23.618
At first, I could only cook
macaroni and cheese.

01:09:23.702 --> 01:09:25.746
-Now, I'm cooking chicken.
-She's doing a lot better.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.790
Yeah, Camille can testify.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.540
Now, now, be honest. Be honest.

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:32.877
How hard has it been
to go from macaroni and cheese

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:37.173
to being able to cook chicken
and a variety of other food groups?

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:38.884
It's been a lot easier than I thought.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:40.886
At first, I think
I really just didn't do this stuff,

01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:42.595
<i>'cause I was scared.</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.598
<i>I didn't know kind of what temperature</i>
<i>or anything to cook chicken on</i>

01:09:45.683 --> 01:09:47.350
<i>or really how to do any of this stuff.</i>

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:49.937
<i>I think a lot of it is just </i>
<i>now that I know how to do it,</i>

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:53.439
I know what food to even look for to eat,
it's been a lot easier.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.901
And now, I'm more willing
to experiment and try things.

01:09:55.984 --> 01:09:58.112
That's cool. All right, high five to that.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.113
Well done.

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:01.239
[Producer]
What do you think

01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:04.785
about the lunches served
in the cafeteria here at school?

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:06.619
Ick!

01:10:06.704 --> 01:10:08.706
I don't like the lunches here.

01:10:08.789 --> 01:10:09.915
I don't eat them.

01:10:09.998 --> 01:10:11.207
-[Producer] No?
-No.

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:12.542
[Producer]
They look gross?

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.712
Well, it's not that they look gross.

01:10:14.795 --> 01:10:16.379
It's just that...

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:17.923
if you know the truth about them,

01:10:18.006 --> 01:10:21.300
it probably wouldn't be
that appealing to you.

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:23.178
[Corcoran] <i>The way that nutrition</i>
<i>is taught in schools</i>

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:25.388
is that I don't see
any nutrition taught in schools.

01:10:26.849 --> 01:10:29.392
[Corcoran] <i> Honestly, that's not part</i>
<i>of a curriculum at a school.</i>

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:31.061
<i>I just do it because I love it,</i>

01:10:31.145 --> 01:10:32.855
<i>and it just grates on me</i>

01:10:32.938 --> 01:10:36.066
<i>that kids don't know these pieces</i>
<i>of nutrition they should know.</i>

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.277
<i>I mean, look at the cafeteria.</i>

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.906
<i>Look at the food</i>
<i>that we're being told is healthy.</i>

01:10:44.074 --> 01:10:45.491
<i>They see the same thing for lunch,</i>

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:47.953
<i>hot dogs, meatballs, and bread.</i>

01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:50.164
<i>It's day after day.</i>

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.457
<i>I feel as though we have a responsibility</i>

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:56.252
<i>to feed them way more</i>
<i>micronutrient-rich foods.</i>

01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:58.172
Why can't we offer a salad bar?

01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:02.050
<i>But kids are with us eight hours a day,</i>

01:11:02.134 --> 01:11:04.552
<i>and who's teaching them these things?</i>

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:07.388
A lot of the parents don't know the facts,

01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:08.556
<i>and that's not their fault.</i>

01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:10.976
<i>It's just the way a lot of us were raised.</i>
<i>It was the way I was raised.</i>

01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:13.394
<i>I had no idea until I was in my 20s.</i>

01:11:17.983 --> 01:11:20.944
<i>So, I wish that there would be a buy-in</i>

01:11:21.028 --> 01:11:23.906
<i>where, you know, a district would say,</i>
<i>"This is important.</i>

01:11:23.989 --> 01:11:27.159
<i>"It's part of a balanced</i>
<i>and holistic education</i>

01:11:27.242 --> 01:11:29.619
<i>where you have academics, health."</i>

01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:34.415
<i>I mean, there really should be</i>
<i>a little something for everything.</i>

01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:39.545
There's ways to integrate in
really great, new, modern topics

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:42.715
that they need to know
to be productive people in society.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:46.719
And nutrition is, as far
as I'm concerned, on top of that list.

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:53.309
It takes more than just school.

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:55.270
It takes a whole curriculum
built around it.

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:57.022
<i>It takes a teacher who knows how to do it.</i>

01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:59.690
It takes time within the school day.

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:02.820
It takes a lunchroom that's committed
to incorporating the food.

01:12:02.903 --> 01:12:04.029
<i>It takes district-wide support.</i>

01:12:04.112 --> 01:12:06.990
It takes, like, a village
to make that work.

01:12:07.074 --> 01:12:10.160
The pendulum has swung so far

01:12:10.244 --> 01:12:15.833
from eating wholesome food
to eating processed... junk

01:12:15.916 --> 01:12:18.293
in such a short amount of time

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:22.380
with such momentum
and such power behind it

01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:27.302
that to swing it around
is really gonna take everybody.

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:29.179
Like, all the people.

01:12:29.263 --> 01:12:31.056
And schools...

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:35.518
The public schools,
a lot of them are not at that point.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:39.064
[Cross] <i>From what I've seen,</i>
<i>I can understand Eliza's frustration.</i>

01:12:39.147 --> 01:12:43.568
<i>She's right.</i>
<i>Most public schools have a long way to go.</i>

01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:47.405
<i>But then, I heard</i>
<i>about a little ray of sunshine.</i>

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:52.535
<i>Someplace where Eliza</i>
<i>and Kate's hopes and dreams are a reality.</i>

01:12:54.913 --> 01:12:56.747
[Adin]
<i>At Ocean Knoll,</i>

01:12:56.831 --> 01:13:00.626
<i>we have more than five wellness activities</i>
<i>to keep our students going.</i>

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.503
<i>Let's check these out.</i>

01:13:08.176 --> 01:13:10.220
<i>First up, the garden project.</i>

01:13:11.263 --> 01:13:13.472
<i>Miss Bond wanted us to make a movie</i>

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:16.018
<i>about all of the health</i>
<i>and wellness at school.</i>

01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:19.437
So we got a list of everything
that we do at Ocean Knoll,

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.439
<i>the yoga, this farm,</i>

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:23.358
<i>the nutrition lab, the garden,</i>

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:25.651
<i>after and before-school activities.</i>

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:30.740
And then we put it together into a movie
showing how amazing

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:33.451
the health and wellness
at Ocean Knoll really is.

01:13:36.997 --> 01:13:39.540
[Tim Baird] Joe, welcome
to Encinitas Union School District.

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:41.209
We're here at Ocean Knoll School,

01:13:41.293 --> 01:13:42.793
and this is a pretty special place.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:46.589
So, what makes this school different, Tim,

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:48.841
from other schools across America?

01:13:48.926 --> 01:13:51.386
I think we look
at more a holistic view of learning.

01:13:51.469 --> 01:13:54.722
You know, we believe
hat we're teaching to the whole child,

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:57.808
so we do spend a lot of time in academics,

01:13:57.892 --> 01:13:59.477
and our kids do very well there.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.563
But health and wellness
is also a big part of what we teach.

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:05.524
<i>All of our schools have</i>
<i>these amazing teaching gardens.</i>

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:08.028
<i>But then they also study math.</i>
<i>They study science,</i>

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:10.238
and then that connects to in the kitchen.

01:14:10.322 --> 01:14:12.115
This is not the norm,
what we're dealing with here.

01:14:12.199 --> 01:14:13.449
This is not the norm.

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:14.784
We hope that it will become the norm.

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:21.749
<i>Coming here really helped</i>

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:25.337
to re-engage my passion
for working with children

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:29.924
where, of course, the reading, and math,
and the academics are important,

01:14:30.008 --> 01:14:31.884
but really looking at the whole child,

01:14:31.969 --> 01:14:34.512
and what are we doing to produce students

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:38.641
who are going to be successful
and happy citizens

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:39.642
when they leave us

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.644
and go out into the real world
on their own.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:45.731
This morning,
we're gonna make some herb pesto.

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:48.193
Like-- [chuckles] Like always,

01:14:48.276 --> 01:14:51.154
the herbs are up to you
what you guys wanna put in.

01:14:51.238 --> 01:14:53.156
So, we have some basil

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.450
and some parsley
that's looking really beautiful.

01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:57.910
If you wanna put spinach in, chard.

01:14:57.995 --> 01:15:00.330
[Jennifer Bond]
<i>Besides their regular, academic classes,</i>

01:15:00.414 --> 01:15:04.917
they have the opportunity
to be in the gardening classes.

01:15:05.002 --> 01:15:09.672
So they're hands-on,
outside of the classroom, in the garden

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:13.592
actually experiencing what they talk about
maybe in a science lesson

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:16.179
there, then in the garden, living it.

01:15:17.222 --> 01:15:18.597
Okay, here's a piece.

01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:24.229
That is so cool. Watch it drop in.

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:28.108
[Christa Holder]
<i>Our kids love vegetables.</i>

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:29.775
<i>A lot of parents thank me,</i>

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:33.196
because their kids are willing to eat
a lot of green things

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.822
that before, they never would.

01:15:34.905 --> 01:15:36.532
Oh, here's one.

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:38.951
<i>[Holder] If they can take it </i>
<i>off of the plant and just hold it,</i>

01:15:39.036 --> 01:15:42.788
<i>there's something</i>
<i>about the engagement and the contact.</i>

01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:45.666
<i>I don't know, like...</i>
<i>The whole sensual experience.</i>

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:47.668
<i>It's something that smells fantastic.</i>

01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:50.629
<i>Like, the colors are really engaging.</i>

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:53.050
They want to be a part of it.

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:54.592
How's it coming?

01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:57.720
Can we break that off,
or do I need to get a tool?

01:15:57.803 --> 01:15:59.181
-[Kids] Tool
-Tool.

01:15:59.264 --> 01:16:01.183
[Baird]
<i>I think kids love getting out in the dirt.</i>

01:16:01.266 --> 01:16:03.226
<i>You know, it's part of being a kid, </i>
<i>first of all.</i>

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:06.438
<i>But they also enjoy,</i>
<i>I think, connecting with nature.</i>

01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:08.148
<i>What's amazing about being out here</i>

01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:10.233
<i>is they actually can see</i>
<i>where their food comes from.</i>

01:16:10.317 --> 01:16:14.071
<i>And you will see kids</i>
<i>who have harvested their produce,</i>

01:16:14.154 --> 01:16:17.282
<i>and they will...</i>
<i>They will try it. They will taste it.</i>

01:16:17.365 --> 01:16:20.077
<i>They will say, "I've never known</i>
<i>spinach tastes this good."</i>

01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:25.873
[Bond] <i> You ask any of the students</i>
<i>what their favorite class is,</i>

01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:27.625
<i>and it's the nutrition class for sure.</i>

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:30.586
They love to be able
to cook and then eat it.

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:34.006
[Student]
<i>We had cauliflower with pesto sauce.</i>

01:16:34.091 --> 01:16:36.301
<i>We had a garden salad,</i>

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:40.054
<i>which was just like</i>
<i>a bunch of different plants, herbs.</i>

01:16:40.138 --> 01:16:43.015
And it's really cool,
because we get to make it ourselves.

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.810
[Erin Buston]
<i>I didn't realize how unique we are.</i>

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:49.481
But now, being exposed to
a different district that my son goes to,

01:16:49.564 --> 01:16:52.817
I got this list of foods you can't eat.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.403
All this no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:55.487 --> 01:16:57.572
And honestly, I was so shocked by it,

01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:00.283
<i>I said to their teacher,</i>
<i>"I can't believe this."</i>

01:17:00.367 --> 01:17:02.494
And she said,
"You don't have a wellness program?"

01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:05.079
<i>And I went, "Oh, no." </i> [laughs]

01:17:05.163 --> 01:17:06.664
"This is not a wellness program.

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:10.544
These things you can't eat,
that's not a wellness program."

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.087
<i>And then I thought of Encinitas,</i>
<i>and this is what we do.</i>

01:17:13.171 --> 01:17:14.755
<i>They say, "How can we be well?"</i>

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:17.925
<i>And they focus</i>
<i>on all the good things we can do.</i>

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:20.052
And we put the resources
in the kids' hands

01:17:20.137 --> 01:17:21.971
and let them make their choices,

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:24.849
and it's just so much more powerful
and so much more fun.

01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:25.975
It's really fun.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:30.397
[Baird]
This was a dumping ground.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.357
I will tell you. It was a vacant lot.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.066
It's always been owned
by the school district.

01:17:34.151 --> 01:17:36.068
But it was full of trash.

01:17:36.153 --> 01:17:38.863
People would drop off old beds and things,

01:17:38.946 --> 01:17:40.198
so we would have to clean up.

01:17:40.282 --> 01:17:41.699
And it was really an eyesore.

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:44.327
<i>We now... We have grown a food forest.</i>

01:17:44.411 --> 01:17:45.953
These are our fruit trees.

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:47.205
I can see some apple here.

01:17:47.289 --> 01:17:51.125
You've got all that swiss chard.
You got your strawberries, sweet potato.

01:17:51.209 --> 01:17:55.213
This will pay for itself, really,
in the produce that we are using

01:17:55.297 --> 01:17:57.591
<i>for the teaching kitchen</i>
<i>that we have on this campus,</i>

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.635
<i>and then we also have a daily salad bar</i>

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:03.263
<i>that has fresh, locally-grown produce.</i>

01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:05.390
<i>We also give to local food banks.</i>

01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:08.017
<i>We believe the community</i>
<i>is a major part of what we do here.</i>

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.520
This is one of the ways
that we can give back to our community.

01:18:10.604 --> 01:18:13.063
Tim, how many schools in America
have signs saying,

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:14.316
"Keep your worms happy."

01:18:14.399 --> 01:18:15.525
Probably not that many.

01:18:15.609 --> 01:18:17.569
I like that you've got that here.
Now, where are the worms?

01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:19.446
-We've got worms right over here.
-I love worms.

01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:21.030
Oh, wow! Look at that.

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:23.157
We have a lot of worms
doing their job in here.

01:18:23.241 --> 01:18:24.992
There's a whole bunch of them.
Just look at that.

01:18:25.075 --> 01:18:28.455
-[Baird] We've got some happy worms here.
-[Cross] Very happy worms.

01:18:28.538 --> 01:18:30.915
[Adin]
<i>Worms are awesome. Without worms,</i>

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:34.877
<i>many of the plants on the farm wouldn't be</i>
<i>nearly as healthy as they are now.</i>

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.130
And worms are pretty cool,
wiggling around, doing their thing.

01:18:38.215 --> 01:18:40.007
So, I think worms are cool.

01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:45.347
[Baird] <i>We have to look </i>
<i>at things differently as educators</i>

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:46.931
<i>as to how we get at this.</i>

01:18:47.014 --> 01:18:48.974
Everybody comes back
to academics in the school district.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:51.394
<i>Our kids do very, very well academically.</i>

01:18:51.478 --> 01:18:54.231
Seven of our nine schools
were California Distinguished Schools.

01:18:54.314 --> 01:18:55.607
So on that side of it,

01:18:55.690 --> 01:18:57.107
I feel like the time spent

01:18:57.191 --> 01:18:59.486
on the health, and nutrition,
and the wellness

01:18:59.569 --> 01:19:00.986
has been time well spent.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.947
[guitar playing upbeat tune]

01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:08.662
[Baird] <i>But we also see</i>
<i>that our kids are healthier,</i>

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:11.080
<i>our kids perform better</i>
<i>on state assessments</i>

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:14.668
<i>related to strength, conditioning, </i>
<i>and flexibility. </i>

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.961
<i>I think partially because of the yoga.</i>

01:19:17.044 --> 01:19:20.590
<i>Our students leave this district</i>
<i>literate in nutrition,</i>

01:19:20.674 --> 01:19:22.467
<i>literate in health and wellness,</i>

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:25.219
and I think that's a literacy they need
as much as reading and math.

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:31.685
Everybody at Ocean Knoll
is proud to plant something,

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:34.562
watch it grow, help it grow,

01:19:34.646 --> 01:19:36.314
and then eat it.

01:19:36.398 --> 01:19:40.901
Eating something that you created
is just an amazing thing to do.

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:45.155
[Baird]
<i>I think this has been, um, really synergy</i>

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:47.575
<i>from our community, from our staff,</i>

01:19:47.659 --> 01:19:50.620
<i>from our teachers, and parents.</i>

01:19:50.704 --> 01:19:53.205
<i>And it started with some school gardens,</i>

01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:55.292
<i>and we realized that</i>
<i>within our school gardens,</i>

01:19:55.375 --> 01:19:57.711
<i>there were some amazing</i>
<i>learning opportunities happening.</i>

01:19:57.793 --> 01:19:59.379
Now, we do have some advantages.

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:01.715
We have a year-round growing season
here in San Diego.

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:04.634
But there are some things
that we do that any school can do.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:06.844
[Cross]
<i>Tim's right.</i>

01:20:06.927 --> 01:20:08.305
<i>Not everywhere has the luxury</i>

01:20:08.388 --> 01:20:11.391
<i>of the gorgeous weather</i>
<i>that is southern California.</i>

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:16.730
<i>But weather alone doesn't determine </i>
<i>how successful a wellness program can be.</i>

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:18.315
<i>As we've just seen,</i>

01:20:18.398 --> 01:20:21.817
<i>schools can be an awesome location</i>
<i>for a garden or farm.</i>

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.571
<i>But really, the magic of these gardens</i>

01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:29.158
<i>is the way they can bring</i>
<i>a community together.</i>

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:32.161
<i>Take Eliza's program</i>
<i>on the South Side of Chicago,</i>

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:34.038
<i>the Windy City Harvest Farm.</i>

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:36.957
<i>Located in one</i>
<i>of the roughest neighborhoods in the city,</i>

01:20:37.041 --> 01:20:41.463
<i>the farm stand sells fresh food</i>
<i>to the whole community at reduced rates,</i>

01:20:41.546 --> 01:20:46.343
<i>and the kids can take home</i>
<i>as much free produce as they can carry.</i>

01:20:46.426 --> 01:20:48.135
<i>The farm itself is a safe place.</i>

01:20:48.218 --> 01:20:49.763
-Here. You wanna carry it together?
-I got it.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:50.846
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:52.474
All right. Thank you.

01:20:52.557 --> 01:20:55.518
[Cross] <i>Where local kids can work</i>
<i>throughout the growing season</i>

01:20:55.602 --> 01:20:57.395
<i>instead of taking fast food jobs.</i>

01:20:57.479 --> 01:20:59.647
<i>It's a place </i>
<i>where they can earn a few dollars</i>

01:20:59.731 --> 01:21:02.484
<i>and maybe change their lives.</i>

01:21:02.567 --> 01:21:06.111
Every season, 90 teenagers
from all around Chicago come here

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:09.031
<i>and work on the farm with us every day.</i>

01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:11.241
<i>They're developing a relationship </i>
<i>with their food.</i>

01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:13.745
<i>They're seeing </i>
<i>how the food makes them feel</i>

01:21:13.828 --> 01:21:15.663
<i>when they're eating in a healthy way.</i>

01:21:15.747 --> 01:21:17.499
[Student]
<i>I used to eat a bunch of French fries,</i>

01:21:17.582 --> 01:21:19.333
<i>and spicy chicken sandwiches, and stuff.</i>

01:21:19.417 --> 01:21:24.714
<i>I think the food really affected me, like,</i>
<i>emotionally and my acne.</i>

01:21:24.798 --> 01:21:26.800
<i>And I think that's </i>
<i>when it just dawned up on me</i>

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:28.510
to start eating
more fruits and vegetables.

01:21:28.593 --> 01:21:29.677
There's so many benefits.

01:21:29.761 --> 01:21:33.055
[Fournier] <i>They're exposing themselves</i>
<i>to new opportunities,</i>

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:37.059
and it's having a real ripple effect
throughout their whole community.

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:38.478
Okay, how many boxes is that?

01:21:38.561 --> 01:21:39.479
-Ten.
-Ten?

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:40.647
[Fournier]
<i>These are teenagers,</i>

01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:43.107
<i>but it's never too young to start,</i>

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:47.027
<i>and it's never too old to start,</i>
<i>and that's what we're seeing.</i>

01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:50.072
<i>They're eating healthy,</i>
<i>taking food home to their family,</i>

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:53.660
<i>moving their bodies 20 hours a week</i>
<i>for seven weeks.</i>

01:21:54.619 --> 01:21:56.538
That's how habits are created.

01:21:56.621 --> 01:21:59.457
In my opinion, if you get the kids,
everybody else is gonna follow.

01:21:59.541 --> 01:22:01.668
'Cause kids don't wanna be sick
like their parents.

01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:04.128
And a lot of times,
parents still won't do the right thing,

01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:06.922
because they think
their kids are not gonna like it.

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:08.633
[Fournier]
<i>Even if you think you won't like it,</i>

01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:11.260
<i>take a risk. Try it.</i>

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:14.764
<i>You might have discovered</i>
<i>your most favorite food in the world.</i>

01:22:14.848 --> 01:22:16.599
Y'all got me hooked.

01:22:16.683 --> 01:22:20.770
And that lesson carries on
through every other aspect of their life,

01:22:20.854 --> 01:22:22.104
not just with food.

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:24.566
Take a risk. Try it.

01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:26.024
You might like it.

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:27.943
Being able to have a voice

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:31.405
to educate people about taking control
of your health, like you said,

01:22:31.489 --> 01:22:33.783
is just the most powerful thing
one can do.

01:22:38.663 --> 01:22:41.081
Emily Dickinson once said,

01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:43.292
"If you take care of the small things,

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:46.211
the big things take care of themselves."

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:47.963
As we've just seen,

01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:52.217
it's gonna take a lot of small steps
to tackle childhood obesity

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:56.263
<i>and ensure that our kids</i>
<i>have a longer, healthier life.</i>

01:22:57.474 --> 01:22:59.433
<i>From smart swaps,</i>

01:22:59.517 --> 01:23:01.310
<i>to starting a garden,</i>

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:02.978
<i>to reading labels,</i>

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:05.732
<i>to learning how to cook,</i>

01:23:05.815 --> 01:23:09.234
<i>there's a lot of small things</i>
<i>that everyone can do</i>

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.738
<i>to make changes in their lives</i>

01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:13.740
<i>or the lives of those around them.</i>

01:23:14.908 --> 01:23:17.911
<i>Now, no one is saying this is easy.</i>

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:21.664
<i>With busy parents,</i>
<i>under-funded and over-stretched schools,</i>

01:23:22.749 --> 01:23:25.375
<i>lack of access and knowledge,</i>

01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:27.545
<i>there are some real hurdles to overcome.</i>

01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:31.089
<i>But there's a place</i>
<i>for all kinds of approaches,</i>

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:35.052
<i>whether it's one educator</i>
<i>talking about sugary drinks</i>

01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:38.347
<i>or a talking carrot</i>
<i>on a nutrition mission,</i>

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:40.975
<i>or 13-year-olds staging a boycott,</i>

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:45.563
<i>or a whole school district putting </i>
<i>nutrition at the center of its curriculum.</i>

01:23:45.647 --> 01:23:47.481
<i>Some programs are simple.</i>

01:23:47.565 --> 01:23:49.066
<i>Others are complex.</i>

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:52.069
<i>All make a difference.</i>

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:55.573
<i>And let's take heart</i>

01:23:55.657 --> 01:23:59.117
<i>that most of the experts</i>
<i>I've talked to on this journey</i>

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:02.120
<i>are actually really positive </i>
<i>about the future.</i>

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:04.206
<i>They think we're on the right track.</i>

01:24:06.793 --> 01:24:10.755
<i>But they're all well aware</i>
<i>that we're not gonna snap our fingers</i>

01:24:10.838 --> 01:24:13.382
<i>and end childhood obesity overnight.</i>

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:14.968
It's gonna take some time,

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:18.888
perhaps a long time,
to change a nation's eating habits.

01:24:19.889 --> 01:24:21.306
<i>But if we can do it,</i>

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:23.141
<i>one child at a time...</i>

01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:26.520
<i>one family at a time...</i>

01:24:28.022 --> 01:24:29.439
That's how you are with chocolate.

01:24:29.523 --> 01:24:30.984
<i>One community at a time...</i>

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:37.740
<i>pretty soon, we might just be able</i>
<i>to tick the box on this one</i>

01:24:37.824 --> 01:24:40.200
and call it a job well done.

01:24:42.662 --> 01:24:44.706
Anybody who tells you
we're not making progress

01:24:44.789 --> 01:24:46.958
doesn't know what they're talking about.

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:50.252
Nobody could have predicted five years ago
we'd be where we are. Nobody.

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:55.090
And I was getting in, ready to dig in
and dedicate my life to this,

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:56.091
and I would have told you

01:24:56.174 --> 01:24:58.135
if we would have gotten
a third of where we are,

01:24:58.218 --> 01:24:59.344
I would have been ecstatic.

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:01.305
So, we're making huge progress.

01:25:01.388 --> 01:25:04.099
It doesn't mean there's not, you know,
decades more work to do.

01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:06.393
-That's a good-news story, isn't it?
-It's a great-news story.

01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:09.229
I actually believe that it is kids,

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:10.648
they're gonna make their own future.

01:25:10.732 --> 01:25:12.692
They're in the mood for it. They want it.

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:14.068
They've got the information.

01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:15.569
They're enthusiastic about it.

01:25:15.653 --> 01:25:16.821
I have a tremendous amount of hope.

01:25:17.947 --> 01:25:22.159
Everybody has the ability
to help change a school.

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:26.413
And schools are hungry
for this kind of change.

01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:30.292
Nobody, no teacher,
no principal, no food service director,

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:34.296
wants kids to show up at their desk
in the morning not well-nourished

01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:36.423
and not ready to learn.

01:25:36.506 --> 01:25:40.762
And all of us have the ability
to take basic steps

01:25:40.845 --> 01:25:42.722
to get kids on the right track.

01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:46.391
There are more kids
watching other kids cook on television.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:48.435
There are more kids
talking about it themselves

01:25:48.518 --> 01:25:50.520
among their own peers.

01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:52.023
I think a lot of this movement

01:25:52.106 --> 01:25:54.566
has to come from the kids themselves,
you know.

01:25:54.651 --> 01:25:56.234
Kids have to be empowered.

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:58.780
And the more involved
they get in that process,

01:25:58.863 --> 01:26:00.614
it goes back to that self-esteem issue.

01:26:00.698 --> 01:26:03.575
The more they want to take part
in eating that food,

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:06.996
because they prepared it.
It's a self-esteem issue.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.874
-[Producer] Do you like healthy food?
-Kind of.

01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:11.751
I like broccoli a lot.

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:14.671
-[Producer] Yeah?
-Yeah, that's my favorite vegetable.

01:26:14.754 --> 01:26:16.546
[Producer]
And what's your favorite fruit?

01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:18.007
Banana.

01:26:18.091 --> 01:26:20.677
[Producer]
Okay, so broccoli and banana.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.637
Why don't you tell us what vegetables were

01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:27.058
on your healthy habits chart
that you did today?

01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:29.686
-Can I go get that? 'Cause I forgot.
-[Producer] Okay.

01:26:29.769 --> 01:26:31.311
I'll be right back.

01:26:33.147 --> 01:26:34.523
Never mind. I remember now.

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:35.983
I threw it out by accident.

01:26:37.151 --> 01:26:41.155
There was broccoli and...
That was it, broccoli.

01:26:42.656 --> 01:26:44.449
Are you videoing this?

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:47.870
Are you gonna put this to let everyone see
in the whole entire world?

01:26:47.954 --> 01:26:48.871
Hi.

01:26:48.955 --> 01:26:50.081
-Are you?
-[Cross] Yeah.

01:26:50.164 --> 01:26:52.582
What? What?
