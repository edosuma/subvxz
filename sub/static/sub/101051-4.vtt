WEBVTT

01:21.014 --> 01:24.001
[indistinct chatter]

01:28.012 --> 01:31.004
[Dorothy] Do you have to leave
so soon?

01:31.006 --> 01:33.017
We've only
just finished teatime.

01:33.019 --> 01:35.015
[Niles] I'm afraid so.

01:35.017 --> 01:38.017
If I have another cup of tea,
I might turn into a teapot.
[chuckles]

01:39.010 --> 01:41.009
I'll not be gone long.

01:41.011 --> 01:45.008
And I'll never be further away
than a blink from
one of Danny's traffic lights.

01:45.010 --> 01:47.023
Now, remember,
they're in charge
when I'm gone.

01:48.001 --> 01:49.012
Right, Danny?

01:49.014 --> 01:50.018
[Danny beeps]

01:57.011 --> 01:58.014
[sighs deeply]

02:02.007 --> 02:03.023
Next time you visit,

02:04.021 --> 02:07.008
can we go outside together?

02:07.010 --> 02:12.006
I could see the traffic lights
and everything else up there
where Danny is.

02:13.019 --> 02:15.003
[sighs]

02:16.002 --> 02:18.003
Danny's everywhere.

02:18.005 --> 02:21.008
-They're all around you.
-I know they are.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.009
But I still get lonely.

02:25.021 --> 02:29.004
-Sometimes I just wish--
-[stutters] Don't!

02:29.006 --> 02:31.018
I told you
never to say that word!

02:33.001 --> 02:37.000
Wishes can have
a terrible cost.

02:38.013 --> 02:40.011
Promise me you'll be good...

02:40.013 --> 02:43.011
for your dad
and for Danny, hmm?

02:45.011 --> 02:47.003
[indistinct chatter]

02:49.012 --> 02:52.000
[sighs] Farewell, my friend,

02:52.002 --> 02:53.006
and thank you.

02:57.009 --> 02:58.008
[Danny beeps]

02:58.010 --> 03:00.002
We've discussed this, Danny.

03:00.004 --> 03:02.015
I'm needed elsewhere.

03:02.017 --> 03:04.004
The work I'm doing
will make the world

03:04.006 --> 03:07.000
a safer place for you
and for Dorothy.

03:07.002 --> 03:08.006
[Danny beeps]

03:10.015 --> 03:13.008
It's not forever,
it's just until I...

03:14.008 --> 03:15.007
It's...

03:16.013 --> 03:17.018
It's just un...

03:19.014 --> 03:20.022
[sighs]

03:21.000 --> 03:23.017
She needs you, Danny.

03:24.006 --> 03:26.002
I need you.

03:26.004 --> 03:30.002
As long as you're around,
I know everything
is gonna be okay.

03:38.008 --> 03:40.018
Try not to worry
too much, Dorothy.

03:42.008 --> 03:44.013
Danny's always bounced back.

03:44.015 --> 03:47.016
But if Danny
isn't even a brick...

03:47.018 --> 03:50.020
how will Danny
ever become a street?

03:50.022 --> 03:54.007
-And if Danny can't be--
-Danny made you a promise.

03:54.009 --> 03:57.001
There'll always be
a place for you there.

03:58.012 --> 04:00.002
[doorbell rings]

04:00.004 --> 04:02.001
I'll get it.

04:04.013 --> 04:06.022
You're thinking
of sending her back,
aren't you?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.017
I am thinking of nothing but...

04:08.019 --> 04:12.005
helping to cure
a very treasured friend,
thank you.

04:12.007 --> 04:14.023
Niles, that little girl
will simply die

04:15.001 --> 04:17.010
if she finds out that
you're even considering send--

04:17.012 --> 04:20.018
Please, Rita,
save it for the stage.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.016
I've done nothing,

04:21.018 --> 04:23.012
I've decided nothing.

04:27.013 --> 04:29.005
[doorbell rings]

04:35.013 --> 04:39.011
Hi, there.
I'm Flex Mentallo,
the Man of Muscle Mystery.

04:39.013 --> 04:42.017
And my friends and I are...
here to help.

04:42.019 --> 04:46.001
[laughs] Morally corrupt.

04:46.003 --> 04:48.016
Captain Larry Trainor.

04:48.018 --> 04:50.003
[laughs]

04:50.022 --> 04:53.017
Dad, company's here.

04:55.009 --> 04:57.021
-Good to see you again, Flex.
-Doc.

04:57.023 --> 05:00.008
All of you, welcome.

05:00.010 --> 05:03.016
I wish it were
in better circumstances.

05:03.018 --> 05:05.004
We came as soon as we could.

05:05.006 --> 05:07.004
I felt the muscle spasm
in my upper thigh,

05:07.006 --> 05:09.000
and I knew
Danny was in trouble.

05:09.002 --> 05:11.005
-How bad is it?
-I'm not an expert,
but if I had to guess,

05:11.007 --> 05:14.010
I'd say, extremely bad.

05:14.012 --> 05:17.000
[Rita] Well, there must be
something we can do.

05:17.002 --> 05:20.015
Can't you just...
Pump Danny up?

05:20.017 --> 05:24.008
[soft chuckle] I don't pump,
I... flex.

05:24.010 --> 05:26.004
But, unfortunately, Rita,

05:26.006 --> 05:30.012
Danny's far too conceptual
for mortal musculature
to comprehend.

05:30.014 --> 05:33.013
Actually, she might be
on to something.

05:33.015 --> 05:37.009
There's more than one way
to pump our friend up.

05:37.011 --> 05:41.013
-Danny was never just a street.
-[all agreeing]

05:41.015 --> 05:44.009
-Danny is an idea...
-[all] Yes.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.005
-...powered by you and I...
-[all] Yes!

05:47.007 --> 05:50.005
-...powered by love...
-[all loudly] Yes!

05:50.007 --> 05:53.004
-...powered by laughter...
-[all] Yes!

05:53.006 --> 05:56.005
-...powered by joy...
-[all] Yes!

05:56.007 --> 06:00.009
-...powered by music!
-[all cheering and applauding]

06:00.011 --> 06:02.015
Just because
the pulse is slowed

06:02.017 --> 06:05.012
-doesn't mean
the heart is gone.
-[all] Yes.

06:05.014 --> 06:09.012
-Doesn't mean
we can't resuscitate.
-[all] Yes!

06:09.014 --> 06:12.005
Doesn't mean
we can't fill our friend

06:12.007 --> 06:13.023
with joy, love, and laughter.

06:14.001 --> 06:15.016
[all] Yes!

06:15.018 --> 06:17.010
-Y'all know
what I'm talking about?
-[all cheering] Yes!

06:17.012 --> 06:19.004
Tell us what
you're talking about.

06:19.006 --> 06:23.003
-I'm talking...
about a party, y'all.
-[all cheering]

06:23.005 --> 06:24.009
Yes!

06:27.007 --> 06:29.000
[Rita] Oh, wonderful.

06:29.002 --> 06:30.023
So, now I have to plan a party?

06:31.001 --> 06:32.018
No. You actually don't.

06:35.008 --> 06:37.018
Who's this little angel, Niles?

06:37.020 --> 06:40.006
This is my daughter, Dorothy.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.018
She's a very old friend
of Danny.

06:42.020 --> 06:44.018
Pleasure to meet you, Dorothy.

06:46.007 --> 06:48.022
See? Everything's
going to be all right.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.005
Our friends will get Danny
back to their old self
by bedtime.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.003
[bell dings]

06:55.005 --> 06:57.021
[footsteps approaching]

07:00.013 --> 07:02.003
[sighs]

07:06.000 --> 07:07.003
Who's up top?

07:07.022 --> 07:09.000
The painter.

07:10.003 --> 07:11.012
Hmm.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.006
-What?
-Nothing.

07:14.002 --> 07:15.000
I, uh...

07:17.013 --> 07:19.001
The Hangman's
beautiful Daughter

07:19.003 --> 07:23.000
just doesn't exactly
scream leadership potential.

07:23.002 --> 07:24.012
She can fuckin' paint.

07:24.014 --> 07:26.003
Which means she has
one fuckin' talent,

07:26.005 --> 07:27.018
which is one more than you.

07:27.020 --> 07:29.002
Great.

07:29.004 --> 07:30.021
Good. Love the confidence.

07:30.023 --> 07:33.015
It doesn't fuckin' take much
to pack up and leave, Jane.

07:33.017 --> 07:36.022
She could paint outside.
She could paint
a fuckin' landscape!

07:39.016 --> 07:42.000
-Maybe she doesn't
want to leave.
-[scoffs]

07:42.002 --> 07:44.002
[Jane] She's not the only one.
Look around you.

07:44.004 --> 07:45.018
There are more people
down here

07:45.020 --> 07:48.009
who care about
the things up there
than ever before.

07:48.011 --> 07:51.005
Get this through
your fucking head, Jane!

07:51.007 --> 07:53.006
Up there doesn't matter!

07:53.008 --> 07:55.015
The only thing that matters
is Kay,

07:55.017 --> 07:57.008
the kid down here!

07:57.010 --> 07:59.009
It is our job to protect her.

07:59.011 --> 08:02.007
And she deserves better
than your fucking friends!

08:11.019 --> 08:15.003
I can't believe
we're back here
with the Chief,

08:15.005 --> 08:17.019
tails between our legs,
and all that shit.

08:17.021 --> 08:20.018
I mean, fuck,
I at least thought
the one thing I could do

08:20.020 --> 08:23.008
was be a better father
than old man Mengele.

08:23.010 --> 08:25.022
Pretty fucking low bar
to clear.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.012
Why don't you just leave?

08:28.005 --> 08:29.013
That's what we're doing.

08:29.015 --> 08:30.023
Really?

08:31.001 --> 08:32.010
Where would you go?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.020
Somewhere quiet...

08:34.016 --> 08:36.000
where I can paint.

08:36.002 --> 08:37.015
But who pays for everything?

08:37.017 --> 08:40.001
-What do you eat?
Where do you sleep?
-I don't know.

08:43.007 --> 08:44.014
That's not my job.

08:45.007 --> 08:46.010
Whose job is it?

08:46.012 --> 08:48.006
The lady with the sun
for a head?

08:48.008 --> 08:51.020
Somehow, I doubt
she's preapproved
for a fucking bank loan.

08:52.016 --> 08:54.000
[breathes heavily]

08:54.017 --> 08:57.019
I, uh... I just paint.

08:59.011 --> 09:01.023
That's all I want to do.
That's all I'm supposed to do.

09:05.001 --> 09:06.009
You'll figure it out.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.003
Jane always did.

09:09.005 --> 09:12.020
We'll need flowers
here, here, and here.

09:12.022 --> 09:14.016
Some mood lighting.

09:14.018 --> 09:18.006
And then, we need to
clear all this.

09:18.008 --> 09:19.020
I think we can handle that.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.023
-[grunts]
-[all exclaim]

09:23.001 --> 09:23.023
Mmm.

09:27.000 --> 09:27.023
[Larry] Whoa!

09:30.022 --> 09:31.020
[grunts]

09:32.017 --> 09:34.002
[all exclaiming]

09:39.003 --> 09:40.006
Flowers?

09:41.016 --> 09:43.013
-[blows]
-[all exclaim]

09:43.015 --> 09:46.018
-[laughs] Anything else?
-Mmm.

09:49.009 --> 09:51.009
May I? [chuckles]

09:51.011 --> 09:53.007
I may not be able to flex,

09:53.009 --> 09:56.013
but my powers
have gotten pretty impressive
as well.

09:56.015 --> 09:57.018
Watch this.

10:01.002 --> 10:02.000
[grunts]

10:05.006 --> 10:06.022
[laughs sheepishly]

10:07.000 --> 10:08.012
Did it... work?

10:08.014 --> 10:13.004
Yes. Hmm.
Yes, it worked perfectly.

10:13.006 --> 10:15.000
Now I'm going to go...

10:15.002 --> 10:16.003
get a ladder.

10:17.022 --> 10:19.011
Well, hey there, little lady.

10:20.005 --> 10:21.016
Why the long face?

10:21.018 --> 10:23.016
This is just how I look.

10:27.023 --> 10:30.012
You look lovely.

10:31.010 --> 10:32.016
What I meant was is,

10:32.018 --> 10:35.008
why do you seem
so down in the dumps?

10:36.014 --> 10:39.012
-I dropped Danny.
-Hmm.

10:39.014 --> 10:42.007
That's how things got this bad.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.009
It's all my fault.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.019
I see.

10:47.010 --> 10:51.000
Well, if you broke them...

10:51.002 --> 10:53.002
then you gotta
help fix 'em, right?

10:54.012 --> 10:57.009
Mmm-hmm. Hmm.

10:57.011 --> 11:02.002
We still need to hang
that disco ball, but...
I dunno how to.

11:03.008 --> 11:05.000
Wait a minute.

11:05.002 --> 11:07.011
Do you think
you can lend me a hand
with this?

11:08.015 --> 11:10.022
Yeah? [laughs]

11:11.000 --> 11:12.004
All right.

11:13.014 --> 11:18.019
Just be sure
to hold on extra tight.
Okay?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.015
You ready?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.015
That was perfect.

12:03.014 --> 12:06.019
I can't believe
I finally met the Dannyzens!

12:06.021 --> 12:08.017
They're really cool.

12:08.019 --> 12:11.006
But you lived
on Danny the Street,

12:11.008 --> 12:13.002
you never once went up top?

12:13.004 --> 12:14.021
No, never.

12:15.017 --> 12:16.023
Where did you live?

12:17.001 --> 12:19.020
I lived underneath Danny
in the door factory.

12:19.022 --> 12:21.017
I could hear the parties,

12:21.019 --> 12:24.019
but I never got to go
to a Danny party.

12:24.021 --> 12:27.004
Well, that sounds a tad tragic.

12:30.004 --> 12:32.012
This is my
first Danny party, too.

12:32.014 --> 12:33.014
Come, sit.

12:38.013 --> 12:41.001
What does it feel like
to be a grown-up?

12:41.003 --> 12:43.000
[exhales] To be honest,

12:43.002 --> 12:45.015
it can... be stressful.

12:48.007 --> 12:51.014
How do you make yourself
so beautiful?

12:53.005 --> 12:56.010
Well, we're all beautiful,
Dorothy.

12:57.022 --> 13:00.008
But sometimes,
we use enhancements.

13:01.023 --> 13:03.000
How old are you?

13:03.002 --> 13:04.008
Eleven.

13:04.010 --> 13:08.016
But... how many years
have you been alive?

13:08.018 --> 13:11.007
A hundred and three-quarters.

13:11.009 --> 13:16.003
Well, I guess you've earned
a bit of lipstick.

13:20.009 --> 13:21.018
Ladies sit still.

13:31.013 --> 13:32.020
[both giggle]

13:32.022 --> 13:35.004
[piano playing]

13:37.015 --> 13:40.014
[indistinct chatter]

13:55.009 --> 13:56.017
Dorothy?

13:56.019 --> 13:58.021
I turn my back
for one minute,

13:58.023 --> 14:00.016
and you get into mischief.

14:02.010 --> 14:03.021
Rita said I was old enough.

14:03.023 --> 14:06.021
-I will talk to Rita.
-You're embarrassing me.

14:06.023 --> 14:09.009
Dorothy, you are too young
to wear this.

14:09.011 --> 14:12.009
I'm not as young
as you think I am.

14:12.011 --> 14:14.002
[Maura Lee] Party people...

14:14.004 --> 14:16.011
binary and non-binary...

14:16.013 --> 14:17.022
Everybody listen.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.017
This isn't working.

14:20.019 --> 14:22.020
Danny is not whole yet.

14:22.022 --> 14:25.012
We got to turn the party up
a notch...

14:25.014 --> 14:29.016
and I got a new friend
who's got just the trick
to do it.

-Good for you.

28:42.010 --> 28:43.014
Yeah.

28:43.016 --> 28:45.002
So, what's she like?

28:45.004 --> 28:47.019
-Other than brave and cool.
-She's great.

28:47.021 --> 28:50.022
-But she has a past.
-Okay.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.018
-And?
-I don't know.

28:52.020 --> 28:54.018
[sighs] I just...

28:54.020 --> 28:56.014
I can't stop
thinking about her.

28:56.016 --> 28:59.010
Every person in this room
has a past

28:59.012 --> 29:01.003
that someone
persecuted them for.

29:01.005 --> 29:02.022
She's not like me.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.009
I mean, I'm Cyborg.

29:05.011 --> 29:08.011
She's... She's a shock
to my system.

29:10.018 --> 29:14.018
The Dannyzens and I
have been out in the world
for the past... month.

29:15.007 --> 29:17.006
And sadly...

29:17.008 --> 29:19.016
the world
hasn't changed that much.

29:19.018 --> 29:22.005
People still made jokes
behind my back...

29:22.007 --> 29:24.014
and to my face.

29:24.016 --> 29:29.006
My trans-sisters
are still being murdered.

29:29.008 --> 29:34.011
Human beings
are cruel to people
that are different from them.

29:34.013 --> 29:38.002
-Yeah, out there
I had to read a motherfucker.
-[laughs]

29:38.004 --> 29:41.002
He was screaming at me,
calling me all kinds of freak.

29:41.017 --> 29:43.009
I let him know...

29:43.011 --> 29:46.001
he hated the fact
that I was human,

29:46.003 --> 29:47.008
just like him.

29:48.023 --> 29:51.004
That's what disturbed him.

29:51.006 --> 29:54.012
That we somehow
breathe the same air

29:54.014 --> 29:56.023
and walk the same streets.

29:58.012 --> 30:01.012
So much self-hatred out there.

30:01.014 --> 30:04.009
And people turn that hatred
on anyone who doesn't look,

30:04.011 --> 30:06.006
or act like them.

30:09.015 --> 30:11.003
Life is short, Vic.

30:12.010 --> 30:16.002
Go where you feel love.

30:16.004 --> 30:18.007
And if that
love's consistent...

30:19.018 --> 30:20.023
stay.

30:23.016 --> 30:25.008
Come on.

30:25.010 --> 30:27.002
Live in the spirit of Danny.

30:27.004 --> 30:29.006
[club music playing]

30:34.021 --> 30:37.009
Just a robot,
doing the robot.

30:42.009 --> 30:44.008
Okay. Okay, it's all good.

30:44.010 --> 30:48.011
I am high as fuck!
And you are a dancing shadow

30:48.013 --> 30:50.007
with a weird thingy
on your head.

30:50.009 --> 30:52.008
It's all good. It's all good.

30:56.015 --> 30:59.002
[moaning loudly]

31:02.013 --> 31:04.009
-[Rita's voice] <i>Now, now, Rita.</i>
-[gasps]

31:04.011 --> 31:06.015
<i>Ladies sit still.</i>

31:10.011 --> 31:15.009
-Mr. Parker, the producer,
is coming here tonight?
-Mmm.

31:15.011 --> 31:17.010
Does that mean
I got the part?

31:17.012 --> 31:19.006
Not yet...

31:19.008 --> 31:20.023
but I'll get you that part.

31:21.001 --> 31:24.010
Uh, Mommy, I can do it.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.018
What do you want me to do?

31:25.020 --> 31:28.000
I can do a little show,
dance, sing.

31:28.002 --> 31:29.010
[knocking on the door]

31:31.004 --> 31:33.007
Darling, please...

31:33.009 --> 31:35.018
You have other talents.

31:36.013 --> 31:38.017
Focus on those, okay?

31:39.015 --> 31:40.022
Okay.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.010
[woman] <i>Go on.</i>

31:42.012 --> 31:43.019
<i>Get to bed.</i>

32:08.023 --> 32:10.008
[man moaning]

32:13.022 --> 32:16.006
[club music playing]

32:28.005 --> 32:30.011
Are you sure
I should be seeing this?

32:30.013 --> 32:32.002
[Candlemaker] <i>No bedtime.</i>

32:32.022 --> 32:35.020
<i>Stay.</i>

32:35.022 --> 32:39.007
Father always said,
"Nothing good happens
after bedtime."

32:42.004 --> 32:45.023
Lar-Bear! You and I...

32:46.001 --> 32:49.000
-we don't hug enough.
-[sighs]

32:49.002 --> 32:50.016
So, why aren't you
at the party?

32:50.018 --> 32:53.019
Look, I'm not exactly
in a party mood.

32:53.021 --> 32:55.012
Do you want drugs?
Cheap-ass drugs.

32:55.014 --> 32:59.001
No. I'm sure I'd find a way
to ruin that for myself, too.

32:59.003 --> 33:01.000
You gotta do something, though.

33:01.002 --> 33:02.016
Right?

33:02.018 --> 33:04.014
-You can't just sit here.
-What do you
want me to do, Cliff?

33:04.016 --> 33:07.001
Dance? Get wrecked?

33:09.018 --> 33:11.020
I was supposed to
go to outer space.

33:13.001 --> 33:15.017
I was supposed to be
a goddamn father.

33:15.019 --> 33:19.006
I couldn't do a single thing
that I was supposed to do.

33:20.016 --> 33:22.020
What the hell
am I supposed to do
after that?

33:22.022 --> 33:25.008
Look, I get it.
I totally get it.

33:25.010 --> 33:26.011
You saw your kid,

33:26.013 --> 33:28.014
it fucked you up.
Mine did, too.

33:28.016 --> 33:32.004
That's what kids do,
they fuck up
your entire life.

33:32.006 --> 33:34.013
No... They don't.

33:34.015 --> 33:36.020
We are the ones
who fuck everything up.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.019
Our kids just end up
paying for it.

33:48.023 --> 33:51.009
[woman] I'm missing my kid's
science fair for this?

33:51.011 --> 33:54.017
[man] Hey, HQ says we go,
we gotta go.

33:54.019 --> 33:56.002
Talk to me, Cuddles.

33:58.007 --> 34:00.013
These readings
are off the charts.

34:00.015 --> 34:03.010
I need
a no bullshit assessment.

34:03.012 --> 34:07.017
Are we talking potential
worldwide sextinction here?

34:11.023 --> 34:13.008
Let's get it on.

34:14.008 --> 34:16.013
[dance music continues]

34:29.020 --> 34:30.021
Excuse me.

34:31.020 --> 34:33.011
That is quite enough of that.

34:33.013 --> 34:34.020
[music stops abruptly]

34:34.022 --> 34:36.019
All right.

34:36.021 --> 34:39.016
Everyone take three steps back
and keep your hands
where we can see 'em.

34:39.018 --> 34:41.007
What the hell are you?

34:41.009 --> 34:44.007
Baby, we are the Sex Men.

34:46.017 --> 34:48.023
I'm Kiss, she's Torture.

34:49.001 --> 34:52.014
And we're here
to save the world from
a paranormal sexual event.

34:52.016 --> 34:54.007
I have so many questions.

34:54.009 --> 34:55.020
No time for that, ma'am.

34:55.022 --> 34:58.001
You're all in serious danger.

34:58.003 --> 35:00.009
If you need comfort,
talk to Cuddles.

35:00.011 --> 35:03.010
He's outside in our
mobile emission control center.

35:03.012 --> 35:04.015
The Sex Machine.

35:07.009 --> 35:08.013
Okay, enough.

35:08.015 --> 35:10.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't be a hero, son.

35:10.012 --> 35:11.017
If you cock-block us,

35:11.019 --> 35:13.013
you'll end up
fucking the entire world.

35:13.015 --> 35:16.006
Lieutenant Kiss,
Lieutenant Torture...

35:16.008 --> 35:18.022
I never thought
I'd see the Sex Men
at my door.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.016
Wish it were
under better circumstances,
Dr. Caulder.

35:21.018 --> 35:23.023
Uh, hold up.
You know these clowns?

35:24.001 --> 35:26.007
Consider yourself lucky
you don't.

35:26.009 --> 35:29.012
Now, how may we be
of assistance?

35:29.014 --> 35:31.014
-[beeping]
-Earlier this evening

35:31.016 --> 35:35.015
our scanners picked up
a powerful and sustained spike
in hypersexual energy.

35:35.017 --> 35:39.000
-Here? Are you absolutely sure?
-I'm afraid so.

35:39.002 --> 35:40.009
Who the fuck are these guys?

35:40.011 --> 35:42.011
Did someone order strippers
for Danny?

35:42.013 --> 35:44.022
Sexual energy itself
isn't harmful.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
But readings this high
attract a very dangerous
sort of creature.

35:49.002 --> 35:50.007
What kinda creature?

35:51.016 --> 35:53.004
Sex demon.

35:53.006 --> 35:56.012
A perverted poltergeist
with a periscope atop its head.

35:56.014 --> 35:57.022
Goes by the name...

35:58.000 --> 35:59.011
Shadowy Mister Evans.

35:59.013 --> 36:01.018
Hey, yo! I know that guy.

36:01.020 --> 36:04.001
I fuckin' danced with that guy.

36:05.001 --> 36:06.005
Holy fuck!

36:06.007 --> 36:08.015
I danced with a sex demon?

36:08.017 --> 36:09.020
God damn it!

36:10.015 --> 36:12.006
He's already here.

36:12.008 --> 36:15.005
[people talking indistinctly]

36:21.014 --> 36:25.008
Come on, everyone,
we need to keep
the party going.

36:25.010 --> 36:27.017
Danny needs us.

36:27.019 --> 36:29.023
[club music playing softly]

36:31.016 --> 36:34.001
[Candlemaker] <i>No more prison.</i>

36:34.003 --> 36:35.003
What?

36:37.008 --> 36:38.014
What does that mean?

36:38.016 --> 36:43.000
[Candlemaker]
<i>No... more... prison.</i>

36:46.010 --> 36:47.022

36:49.022 --> 36:51.002
[beeping speeds up]

36:51.004 --> 36:53.003
[Kiss] Stay frosty,
we're close.

36:59.002 --> 37:00.019
[moaning]

37:01.017 --> 37:04.005
[moaning gets louder]

37:06.002 --> 37:08.010
What the fuck!

37:08.012 --> 37:09.014
We're too late.

37:10.018 --> 37:12.001
Sex ghosts.

37:13.013 --> 37:16.006
The two of you on the right,
go back to the party.

37:16.008 --> 37:17.013
We need to do
everything we can

37:17.015 --> 37:19.005
to dial down
the erotic amplification.

37:19.007 --> 37:20.005
Hold up.

37:20.022 --> 37:22.004
I'm Cyborg.

37:22.006 --> 37:23.014
Listen to them, Vic,
they are the sexperts.

37:23.016 --> 37:25.007
[Torture] The rest of you
get behind us.

37:25.009 --> 37:28.023
And do not make eye contact
with any of the sex ghosts.

37:29.001 --> 37:30.006
I know I'm going to hell,

37:30.008 --> 37:32.002
but the sex ghosts are hot!

37:32.004 --> 37:33.006
Shut up, Cliff.

37:34.010 --> 37:36.023
I don't know
what you're up to...

37:37.001 --> 37:39.015
but I won't have any of it.

37:39.017 --> 37:42.023
You've always hated Danny
from the moment
we met them.

37:43.001 --> 37:44.022
[Candlemaker] <i>Danny prison.</i>

37:45.000 --> 37:46.020
Danny's my friend.

37:48.012 --> 37:50.011

to you anymore.

37:50.013 --> 37:52.008

37:55.016 --> 37:58.019
-Stop.
-[Candlemaker]
<i>Dorothy grown-up.</i>

37:58.021 --> 38:01.008
<i>Dorothy be free.</i>

38:15.011 --> 38:16.019
[door opens]

38:19.006 --> 38:22.003
-Who are you?
-You're Cuddles.

38:22.005 --> 38:23.014
Is that your real name?

38:23.016 --> 38:25.015
It's not my name,
it's... It's a call sign.

38:25.017 --> 38:27.015
A call sign you chose.

38:27.017 --> 38:29.000
I mean...

38:29.002 --> 38:31.004
I guess. It was either,
"Cuddles" or "Handstuff."

38:31.006 --> 38:34.020
Cuddles was the name
of a stuffed porcupine
you had as a boy.

38:34.022 --> 38:38.002
At 12, Cuddles supplied you
with your first orgasm.

38:38.004 --> 38:40.023
You didn't even know
what masturbation was
at the time.

38:41.001 --> 38:42.005
Bit of a late bloomer.

38:42.007 --> 38:43.018
You just began
rubbing your member

38:43.020 --> 38:45.009
against his cotton quills and--

38:45.011 --> 38:49.013
God, Jesus! Stop! I...

38:49.015 --> 38:53.004
I don't have time for this.
If I don't do my job,
the world is gonna end.

38:54.010 --> 38:56.015
What exactly does that mean?

38:56.017 --> 38:58.003
"The end of the world"?

38:58.020 --> 39:00.002
The death of sex.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.004
Do you understand
what's going on in there?

39:02.006 --> 39:04.015
That sex demon is a vessel.

39:04.017 --> 39:06.010
When it absorbs
enough sexual energy,

39:06.012 --> 39:09.002
it'll give birth
to something even worse.

39:10.018 --> 39:11.020
A baby.

39:11.022 --> 39:14.019
Yes, the symbolism
is palpable--

39:14.021 --> 39:16.005
I'm not kidding!

39:16.007 --> 39:20.013
If that baby cries...
[stammers] It's all over.

39:20.015 --> 39:24.009
The world will become
an adults-only, X-rated,
hedonistic hellscape.

39:24.011 --> 39:28.010
Every child on the planet
will cease to exist.

39:28.012 --> 39:31.019
Tonight, the fate of the world
lies in the hands...

39:31.021 --> 39:33.005
of the Sex Men.

39:34.021 --> 39:35.022
Ahhh!

39:36.010 --> 39:38.009
[panting]

39:38.011 --> 39:41.001
What the fuck
did you just say?

39:41.003 --> 39:44.007
-Uh... uh... [gulps]
-What's gonna happen
to the kids?

39:45.008 --> 39:47.018
Every child, gone.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.022
Poof...

39:52.011 --> 39:53.016
"Poof"?

39:55.010 --> 39:57.016
[screaming]

39:59.001 --> 40:01.003
Are you fucking kidding me?

40:02.010 --> 40:04.002
[continues screaming]

40:07.022 --> 40:08.020
Danny?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.018
I need you
to talk to me like an adult.

40:14.019 --> 40:16.022
Not like a child.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.021
There's no time for that now.

40:23.017 --> 40:26.002
Were you truly my friend...

40:27.014 --> 40:29.007
or were you my prison?

40:45.005 --> 40:48.004
[Candlemaker]
<i>Dorothy sees truth.</i>

40:49.016 --> 40:50.017
Yes.

40:52.019 --> 40:54.010
I think I do now.

41:08.008 --> 41:09.007
Go!

41:12.018 --> 41:15.017
[moaning]

41:23.009 --> 41:25.003
What the fuck!

41:25.005 --> 41:26.023
What's happening?

41:27.001 --> 41:28.018
I can't move!

41:29.012 --> 41:30.017
I'm going in.

41:32.007 --> 41:34.019
Ahhh! Ahhh!

41:36.006 --> 41:38.007
Think of potatoes.

41:38.009 --> 41:41.023
[struggling] Okay.

41:42.001 --> 41:44.016
Lieutenant Kiss, take my hand!

41:51.002 --> 41:52.021
Whoa!

41:52.023 --> 41:55.000
No, here comes
the baby!

42:01.005 --> 42:03.007
[groaning]

42:06.023 --> 42:10.006
[moaning]

42:10.008 --> 42:13.001
I have no fucking clue
what's happening right now!

42:13.003 --> 42:15.007
And I really mean that
this time.

42:15.009 --> 42:18.007
If that baby cries,
it's the end of the world.

42:32.018 --> 42:35.001
Cliff, you have to go in there.

42:35.003 --> 42:37.011
You're the only one of us
that can't orgasm.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.004
A, I'm fucking high,

42:39.006 --> 42:42.000
B, you just totally
embarrassed me
in front of the Sex Men.

42:42.002 --> 42:44.018
C, you want me
to kill a fucking baby?

42:44.020 --> 42:46.001
Fuck, no!

42:49.004 --> 42:52.009
[screaming and groaning]

42:56.011 --> 42:59.007
No! Don't let it cry!

43:13.018 --> 43:15.000
[Candlemaker] <i>Do it.</i>

43:15.019 --> 43:18.005
<i>Dorothy, be free.</i>

43:19.002 --> 43:20.002
Dorothy?

43:21.001 --> 43:22.015
[crying]

43:22.017 --> 43:25.000
I don't know
what to do, Danny.

43:29.013 --> 43:32.006
[tearfully] I can't go back.

43:40.009 --> 43:42.009
[crying]

43:47.010 --> 43:49.006
Shh!

43:55.017 --> 43:58.002
Shh!

43:59.010 --> 44:01.003
[screams]

44:04.007 --> 44:05.020
[groaning]

44:12.014 --> 44:13.013
[gasps]

44:21.016 --> 44:23.012
[woman and man moaning]

44:39.005 --> 44:40.010
We'll take it from here.

44:41.019 --> 44:43.012
[moaning continues]

44:47.008 --> 44:50.007
[soft indistinct chatter]

44:57.003 --> 45:01.001
It's, uh, good that
you saw your block.

45:01.003 --> 45:03.004
Now you can... deal with it.

45:04.014 --> 45:06.013
I don't know
what you're talking about.

45:06.015 --> 45:09.005
I... didn't see a thing.

45:09.007 --> 45:11.005
[both laugh]

45:11.007 --> 45:14.021
Anyway, um... be well, Rita.

45:15.019 --> 45:17.018
And you, Flex.

45:17.020 --> 45:22.006
-Remember, nose to the dot.
-[laughs]

45:22.008 --> 45:26.010
Who's the hero?
Hammerhead's the hero!

45:26.012 --> 45:28.008
Chill out, douche-knuckle.

45:28.010 --> 45:29.015
I was protecting the girl.

45:29.017 --> 45:32.007
Felt pretty good, right,
saving the day?

45:32.009 --> 45:33.010
Are you fucking high?

45:33.012 --> 45:34.023
Are you fucking ready
for a hug?

45:35.001 --> 45:37.017
-Do not.
-We can hug,
or we can Eskimo kiss.

45:37.019 --> 45:39.010
-No.
-Comin' in for the hug.

45:39.012 --> 45:40.008
Comin' in.

45:40.010 --> 45:41.018
-Fuck!
-[groans]

45:41.020 --> 45:44.002
Okay, Jane. [inhales]

45:44.004 --> 45:45.007
You win.

45:45.009 --> 45:48.005
I'm so fucking high!

45:49.015 --> 45:50.013
[groans]

45:59.005 --> 46:01.002
Seems you're on the mend,
Danny.

46:01.023 --> 46:03.003
[Danny beeps]

46:03.005 --> 46:05.020
After several
failed alternatives...

46:05.022 --> 46:08.015
Oh, it'll be a comfort
to know you'll be back.

46:08.017 --> 46:09.018
[Danny beeps]

46:11.003 --> 46:12.018
She was safe there.

46:12.020 --> 46:15.009
The world was safe
with her there.

46:15.011 --> 46:16.014
[Danny beeps]

46:18.003 --> 46:19.023
She was not!

46:20.001 --> 46:22.004
I think, as her father,
I should know!

46:22.006 --> 46:23.006
[Danny beeps]

46:30.005 --> 46:31.003
[sighs]

46:32.003 --> 46:33.013
Attention, everyone,

46:33.015 --> 46:34.018
Attention.

46:34.020 --> 46:36.005
Gather around.

46:36.007 --> 46:37.005
Come on.

46:39.007 --> 46:43.021
Allow me
to reintroduce you
to our beloved Danny.

46:45.008 --> 46:48.009
[all exclaiming]

46:49.023 --> 46:51.008
I don't get it.

46:51.010 --> 46:52.021
Don't judge, teapot.

46:52.023 --> 46:56.019
A tire is just the beginning
of Danny's new journey.

46:57.010 --> 46:58.011
[honks]

46:59.021 --> 47:03.011
Uh, Danny,
some of the Dannyzens
have been asking...

47:04.014 --> 47:05.019
can we come along?

47:15.011 --> 47:17.010
-"Yes."
-[all sighing]

47:17.012 --> 47:19.016
"I wouldn't do this
without you.

47:19.018 --> 47:24.000
Your strength to live,
who you truly are
teaches me.

47:24.002 --> 47:26.022
The world needs
our open hearts and minds,

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
so people like us
don't have to suffer
and live in fear.

47:31.002 --> 47:35.007
Let's spread our message
far and wide.

47:35.009 --> 47:39.003
There are people
looking for someone
to hold their hand.

47:39.005 --> 47:42.011
Let's breathe life
into the misfits,

47:42.013 --> 47:44.013
the forgotten ones...

47:44.015 --> 47:46.016
the outsiders."

47:48.002 --> 47:50.003
-Oh.
-[laughs]

47:50.005 --> 47:51.010
Everyone...

47:56.012 --> 47:58.001
We're ready, Danny.

47:59.011 --> 48:00.018
[Danny beeps]

48:09.009 --> 48:12.015
So, they're not gonna
help clean up the house?

48:28.018 --> 48:31.002
We've been standing here
for like, five minutes, man.

48:31.004 --> 48:34.007
-Can I get a grilled cheese?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.

48:38.016 --> 48:41.018
Hey, what made you
go to Detroit?

48:45.010 --> 48:48.009
I got tired of letting
my trauma run my life.

48:48.011 --> 48:49.014
Wanted to heal.

48:51.005 --> 48:53.010
You don't think
you can heal here?

48:54.000 --> 48:55.001
Can you?

49:00.021 --> 49:03.014
Grid, check for any
new text messages.

49:11.001 --> 49:12.002
Are you back?

49:12.016 --> 49:14.001
Yeah...

49:14.003 --> 49:15.022
and wondering why.

49:16.016 --> 49:18.010
And are you back, Jane?

49:20.002 --> 49:21.002
For now.

49:24.023 --> 49:27.011
Is anyone gonna say
anything about the fact

49:27.013 --> 49:30.013
that Rita's G-spot
almost ended the fucking world?

49:34.020 --> 49:39.007
You should really,
really, really be in bed.

49:41.014 --> 49:44.000
-Rita?
-Hmm?

49:45.018 --> 49:47.021
Did you mean what you said?

49:50.006 --> 49:51.023
Am I beautiful?

49:53.013 --> 49:55.016
Darling, please.

49:55.018 --> 49:59.015
You have other talents.
Focus on those.

50:08.005 --> 50:10.004
I don't want to grow up.

50:15.019 --> 50:17.001
Candlemaker?

50:18.002 --> 50:20.005
[Candlemaker] <i>Don't talk to me.</i>

50:20.007 --> 50:23.023
<i>Talk to your</i>
<i>little girl friends.</i>
