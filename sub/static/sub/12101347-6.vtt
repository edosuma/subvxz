WEBVTT

00:57.599 --> 01:00.644
-Name?
-Carl Longbottom,

01:00.727 --> 01:02.563
reporting for duty,

01:02.646 --> 01:05.858
and prepared to glimpse
through the veil of time.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.822
That is the slogan of your magazine?

01:15.492 --> 01:18.078
I am one of the new junior copy editors.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.373
I was selected
because of a short story I submitted.

01:21.456 --> 01:24.001
Perhaps you read it?
"Tears of the Anaren."

01:24.084 --> 01:27.588
Weirdly enough, I didn't. Wait over there.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.302
Look at this.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.221
Heinlein signed this copy
of Have Space Suit - Will Travel.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.141
What I wouldn't give.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.895
Although if I could pick any Heinlein
to be autographed, I'd go with--

01:42.978 --> 01:45.189
The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress?

01:45.772 --> 01:49.234
-Yeah. How'd you know?
-It was either that or Tunnel in the Sky.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.236
-Tunnel in the Sky.
-Tunnel in the Sky.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.031
-"Watch out for stobor."
-"…stobor!"

01:54.615 --> 01:55.949
Peter Cromwell.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.367
A.E. Goldsmith.

01:57.993 --> 02:01.914
-Carl Longbottom. Are you also--
-Junior copy editors. First day.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.332
Dream come true, isn't it?

02:03.415 --> 02:07.211
It is a dream.
I've only been in Los Angeles a few days.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.964
I'm from Clear Lake, Iowa.
No one reads Amazing Tales in Clear Lake,

02:11.048 --> 02:13.175
much less quotes Heinlein.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.344
-I feel like--
-You found your tribe?

02:16.720 --> 02:18.680
Tri…pod.

02:19.389 --> 02:23.227
There are three of us working together,
like the three legs of--

02:23.310 --> 02:25.145
The iconic Wellsian nightmare.

02:26.772 --> 02:27.981
Coffee.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.988
Is that Ursula K. Le Guin?

02:37.324 --> 02:38.367
Ray Bradbury.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.747
Isaac Asimov.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.254
You three. Let's go. Come on.

02:51.088 --> 02:55.759
So, here's a question I like to ask
all my little pishers on their first day.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.969
Why did I hire you?

02:57.886 --> 03:00.597
Well, we submitted short stories
that clearly showed promise.

03:00.681 --> 03:04.560
Incorrect! You submitted short stories
that were spelled right.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.186
Verb tenses agreed.

03:06.270 --> 03:09.356
Commas went
where commas are actually supposed to go.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.692
This makes you worth your weight in gold.

03:11.775 --> 03:15.112
It's a figure of speech. You're worth
$2 an hour. I start you at a buck 80.

03:15.195 --> 03:19.032
But I know you didn't take this job
to fix other people's grammar

03:19.116 --> 03:21.326
or fetch me tuna sandwiches and Tab.

03:21.410 --> 03:24.997
You took this job because
you have a vision for yourselves.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.081
What is that vision?

03:26.164 --> 03:28.292
-Well, for me--
-Shut up. I'll tell you.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.086
You wanna be published in my magazine.

03:31.170 --> 03:34.339
You wanna be the next big thing.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.176
Well, guess what. You might be.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.679
Go back to those stories.
Fix them up. Rewrite.

03:40.762 --> 03:44.892
And then maybe, just maybe,
I'll publish you.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.270
That said, I've never published
one of you copy edit schmucks before.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.481
I doubt I ever will. If you can handle
those odds, welcome aboard.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.525
Now,

03:54.985 --> 03:56.945
proofread those, retype them

03:57.029 --> 03:58.906
and get me a tuna sandwich and a Tab.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.159
Now! Come on. Let's go.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.169
Okay, how about this?
The most prolific writer in the world--

04:12.252 --> 04:14.254
-Asimov.
-Is Isaac Asimov.

04:14.338 --> 04:18.591
What was the highest amount of
published words he wrote in a single day?

04:19.676 --> 04:21.345
-No idea.
-20,000?

04:21.428 --> 04:22.513
38,000.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.224
My God, he's a machine.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.934
-He's a robot.
-I, Asimov.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.602
-Hey.
-Very good.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.403
I'll take yours too, if you don't mind.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.030
I'll just save the seeds.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.366
-Madam, you are drunk.
-Probably.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.661
And therefore, it has improbably
occurred to me, I love lemons,

04:45.744 --> 04:48.497
why should I keep paying for them
when I can simply grow my own?

04:48.580 --> 04:51.083
No, no. Not with those. Those are dormant.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.503
Apologies. Iowa.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.464
You need a seed that can be germinated.

04:57.548 --> 05:01.677
The right seed, the right conditions.
Only then will it blossom.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.638
Well, then…

05:05.597 --> 05:07.266
To the seeds that blossom.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.899
What?

05:16.525 --> 05:19.111
-Nothing. It's silly.
-Go on. Tell us.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.404
All right. Well…

05:21.822 --> 05:25.450
This morning we saw three legends.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.744
Pillars of their craft.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.123
Two great men, one great woman.

05:31.748 --> 05:35.377
What if one day that is we?

05:42.801 --> 05:44.094
We help each other.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.263
Let's go home tonight,
read each other's stories,

05:46.346 --> 05:49.141
come back tomorrow with feedback,
and help make each other better.

05:49.224 --> 05:53.312
I can't. I'm pretty sure you two
are on a way higher level than me.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.105
Codswallop.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.524
-Codswallop?
-Codswallop.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.775
Codswallop.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.737
If there is an area
where you need to grow, Peter,

06:01.820 --> 06:04.198
we will help you grow.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.868
I did xerox a couple copies of my story

06:07.951 --> 06:09.786
-when Sol wasn't looking.
-I made ten.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.871
Twenty-four.

06:21.798 --> 06:25.385
"'Transistor Moon' by A.E. Goldsmith."

06:25.469 --> 06:28.013
"'The Horror of Westerley Mansion'
by Peter Cromwell."

06:28.096 --> 06:31.099
"'Tears of the Anaren'
by Carl Longbottom."

06:31.183 --> 06:32.559
Tears, like rips.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.938
"Tears of the Anaren."

06:36.021 --> 06:37.856
Yes, and Anaren.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.274
"Tears of the Anaren."

06:39.358 --> 06:42.819
"Anaren." It's a trilled rhotic
as in Tolkien's Quenya.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.448
Got it.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.283
That's interesting.

06:49.701 --> 06:52.538
So tonight, we read. Tomorrow we share.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.644
'Cause you're a moron.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.355
God.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.822
-I'm going to lunch, Rose.
-Nobody gives a shit, Sol.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.703
Okay. Whose story goes first?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.162
Not me, please. I'll go last.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.497
-Okay.
-Peter it is.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.585
It was violent. It was nauseating.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.378
You had a tentacle creature eat a baby.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.422
I know. I'm sorry.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.008
I loved it. It's cosmic horror.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.302
You have to take chances,
you have to shock.

07:48.385 --> 07:51.221
-I only have one suggestion.
-Yes. Please. Anything.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.391
Don't have the family choose
to go to the mansion on their own.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.019
Have them get a mysterious invitation.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.396
And then the killing starts.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.400
That's brilliant, A.E. Thank you.

08:04.026 --> 08:06.778
I wish I could return the favor, but

08:06.862 --> 08:09.489
"Transistor Moon" is nearly perfect.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.367
Start throwing punches
or I'm gonna lose respect for you.

08:12.451 --> 08:15.329
Well, I had one small thought.

08:15.412 --> 08:18.665
So you've got the blind girl
and the alien.

08:18.749 --> 08:22.586
And it seems to me that she's the only one
who could understand his isolation.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.129
So don't change the story,

08:24.213 --> 08:27.674
but let me experience it
through the lens of that relationship.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.676
Oh, my God.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.887
That's gonna elevate everything.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.306
Peter, you're amazing.

08:35.557 --> 08:40.020
Well, I guess that leaves
"Tears of the Anaren."

08:41.313 --> 08:42.313
Yeah.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.192
It's…

08:45.859 --> 08:47.402
It's really--

08:47.486 --> 08:48.570
It's…

08:49.446 --> 08:50.948
-A.E.?
-Me?

08:52.241 --> 08:53.242
No, it's…

08:55.702 --> 08:58.455
I mean, you definitely
have your eye on the future.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.541
-Thank you.
-Sure.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.878
But your actual vision of it is…

09:07.589 --> 09:10.592
Okay. You predict a world where we--

09:10.676 --> 09:12.845
Sorry, the Anaren,

09:12.928 --> 09:16.807
have evolved
to have a flesh pouch on their back.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.560
Yes, to carry things.

09:19.643 --> 09:22.020
Right. But we have backpacks now.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.941
What evolutionary challenge
are you answering?

09:26.024 --> 09:28.694
Well, it is science fiction, Peter.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.196
Sure.
But it has to be connected to reality.

09:31.738 --> 09:36.118
Same with your thing about robot horses.
Why would we--

09:36.201 --> 09:37.202
The Anaren.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.538
Sorry, the Anaren, build robot horses

09:39.621 --> 09:43.041
when we already have cars
which are far simpler and way faster?

09:43.876 --> 09:46.295
Because they're robot horses.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.050
Right.

09:55.179 --> 10:00.434
Carl, it's not enough to propose a future
where things are just different.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.770
They have to be unexpected
and inevitable at the same time.

10:13.197 --> 10:15.449
I must admit, I didn't expect this.

10:17.409 --> 10:20.495
But I will take your advice

10:20.579 --> 10:23.624
and turn "Tears of the Anaren" into--

10:23.707 --> 10:26.877
And about that,
why is it tears and not tears?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.505
'Cause they are crying at one point.

10:29.588 --> 10:32.799
You have notes on the title too?

10:32.883 --> 10:34.259
You know what? Doesn't matter.

10:34.343 --> 10:37.095
Just make your vision compelling.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.556
Really see the world that's yet to come.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.187
Yes.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.321
Yes, that's it.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.156
That's it.

10:57.241 --> 10:59.660
Oh, yes, that's very good!

10:59.743 --> 11:03.413
Yes. The muse has struck.
I see her clearly now.

11:04.331 --> 11:08.168
Yes, it's coming. It's all coming now.
I see it so clearly, finally.

11:08.252 --> 11:11.255
At last! Yes. Yes.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.300
So--

11:16.677 --> 11:19.179
You said you've been rewriting this
for a week?

11:21.557 --> 11:22.724
What do you mean?

11:23.892 --> 11:26.061
It doesn't seem like a ton has changed.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.813
There's something different on every page.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.148
To be fair,
they're mostly surface changes.

11:30.232 --> 11:34.611
For instance, before, you had
the Anaren raising enormous bears as pets,

11:34.695 --> 11:36.822
and now you've made them very tiny bears.

11:37.322 --> 11:40.993
-Correct.
-So… dogs.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.789
And their home world went
from a swamp planet to a desert planet.

11:45.873 --> 11:49.084
Yes. I thought that was an elegant solve
for the story problems.

11:49.168 --> 11:50.252
By making them drier?

11:51.753 --> 11:54.840
There are significant changes
in this draft.

11:54.923 --> 11:57.217
What about the technology I postulate?

11:57.301 --> 12:00.095
The liquid plasma cauldron
they dip their food in.

12:00.179 --> 12:04.474
That is… fondue.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.894
Hey, Carl. I know how it feels.

12:07.561 --> 12:10.814
Writing is brutal for me.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.859
I'm revising my story right now.
I am struggling.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.028
But I'm not struggling.

12:16.695 --> 12:17.988
And it's not fondue.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.700
The Anaren can't even digest cheese.
I made a point of saying that.

12:21.783 --> 12:24.536
Does that sound visionary to you, Carl?

12:27.122 --> 12:29.166
I'm being honest,

12:29.249 --> 12:32.836
because Sol and everyone else out there
is gonna be ten times meaner.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.672
I'm sorry if it's coming out harsh.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.176
I swear I'm just trying to help you.

12:41.303 --> 12:44.223
Should that be "coming out harsh…ly"?

12:45.516 --> 12:47.726
No. "Coming"
in this instance is a linking verb,

12:47.809 --> 12:49.978
so it takes an adjective modifier.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.946
Be patient with yourself. You will see it.

13:05.494 --> 13:06.828
I know you will.

13:44.575 --> 13:47.744
Is this about the xeroxing?
Are we all getting axed?

13:47.828 --> 13:50.289
If Sol fires A.E.,
he'll have to fire me too.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.374
A tripod cannot stand on two legs.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.725
All three of us abused the photocopier.

14:09.808 --> 14:12.186
We won't let you take the fall for this.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.525
Fifty dollars?

14:18.609 --> 14:20.819
He's publishing my story.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.404
What?

14:22.487 --> 14:24.531
Next month,
he's publishing "Transistor Moon."

14:24.615 --> 14:26.783
Oh, my God. Congratulations!

14:26.867 --> 14:29.703
You've already resubmitted. How efficient.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.039
Here's the best part.
I have credibility with him now,

14:32.122 --> 14:35.167
so whenever you're ready to resubmit,
I can get him to read it right away.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.461
Guys, this is so good for us.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.963
For us, yeah. Yes. I can see that.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.382
-We have to celebrate.
-Yes, please. Tonight.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.511
-We're drinking this.
-Yes.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.804
Alcohol sounds good.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.163
The work. The work comes first.

16:05.507 --> 16:08.468
-Hello. Hello?
-Peter, who is it?

16:08.552 --> 16:10.804
I don't know. No one's saying anything.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.097
Hello?

17:01.480 --> 17:03.357
I see you two arrived at the same time.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.693
Guess so.

17:06.777 --> 17:08.069
We missed you last night.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.404
Last night.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.324
Slipped my mind.

17:12.406 --> 17:17.079
Well, A.E. is just giving my revision
a once-over before showing it to Sol.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.247
Wonderful.

17:18.914 --> 17:23.167
If you don't have time to skim
through this, I'm all right with that.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.087
You can just submit it as is.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.923
-Is that--
-Tears of the Anaren?

17:28.674 --> 17:30.717
It's a novel now.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.177
Novella, really.

17:32.261 --> 17:33.971
You did all that last night?

17:35.222 --> 17:36.265
Yes.

17:36.849 --> 17:38.433
And you?

17:40.894 --> 17:43.897
Well, great.
I'll just take both of them in.

18:20.058 --> 18:24.062
You are never going to guess
who is in the conference room again.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.314
Isaac Asimov.

18:25.898 --> 18:28.400
-Yes. I know.
-You know?

18:28.483 --> 18:30.777
In fact, I shared an elevator with him.

18:30.861 --> 18:33.864
You shared an elevator with Isaac Asimov?

18:47.294 --> 18:48.712
Did you say anything?

18:58.722 --> 19:00.807
He actually introduced himself to me.

19:00.891 --> 19:04.645
He asked me my name and what I did.
I told him I was a writer too.

19:09.900 --> 19:10.901
I'm a writer too.

19:12.486 --> 19:13.654
And what did he say?

19:13.737 --> 19:18.158
He said that was nice to hear,
and I said, "Thank you, Mr. Asimov."

19:18.242 --> 19:20.369
And he said,
"Please, Carl, call me Isaac."

19:21.703 --> 19:22.871
And I did.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.667
That's nice.

19:39.847 --> 19:43.058
-First-name basis?
-Yes.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.982
Okay. Peter…

19:52.818 --> 19:55.821
-It wasn't good enough.
-It's not good enough.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.616
-But if you're willing to do more work--
-Of course.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.952
He suggests filling out
the mythology behind Westerleys

20:02.035 --> 20:03.745
and their connection
to the Ancient Terrors.

20:03.829 --> 20:05.831
Something that could lead
to more than one story.

20:05.914 --> 20:09.501
A series. Yeah. I got it. I can do that.

20:13.130 --> 20:14.631
And my novella?

20:18.135 --> 20:21.805
Pretty much the same.
Really excited by the tears.

20:21.889 --> 20:24.057
And the Anaren. And…

20:24.141 --> 20:25.517
Mm-hmm.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.686
"Mm-hmm," what exactly?

20:27.769 --> 20:32.691
Well, just generally speaking,
Sol says keep refining.

20:35.903 --> 20:38.071
He was specific about Peter's work.

20:39.072 --> 20:42.201
Odd he should have so many thoughts
on a 12-pager,

20:42.284 --> 20:45.245
while my novella garners
nothing more than the most generic of--

20:45.329 --> 20:48.373
I didn't give it to him. Okay?

20:49.208 --> 20:50.209
There.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.753
Look, Carl.

20:53.629 --> 20:57.466
Your novella has
the same issues as your short story.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.259
There's just more of it.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.517
I'm really sorry I lied.

21:09.645 --> 21:11.355
But if I show this to Sol…

21:15.275 --> 21:17.778
I'm trying to save you the embarrassment.

21:18.654 --> 21:20.239
Embarrassment?

21:23.534 --> 21:27.496
I am not embarrassed by my work.

21:28.372 --> 21:32.417
And frankly, I'm beginning to think
you don't know what you're talking about.

21:32.501 --> 21:34.711
-Hey. Hold on a second.
-No.

21:35.587 --> 21:40.217
She has been lording herself over me
and you from the very start.

21:40.759 --> 21:44.346
And why?
Because you have one story published?

21:45.055 --> 21:46.974
That doesn't make you Le Guin.

21:48.225 --> 21:51.645
It just means Sol Green sees
something in you he doesn't see in us.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.523
Gee. I wonder what that might be.

21:54.606 --> 21:55.607
Hey!

21:57.442 --> 21:59.111
-Take that back.
-Why should I?

22:01.154 --> 22:05.576
You question my vision?
Well, I question your taste.

22:19.882 --> 22:21.884
I'd like to speak with Sol. Where is he?

22:22.759 --> 22:24.136
Podiatrist.

22:59.755 --> 23:00.756
Mr. Asimov?

23:03.217 --> 23:04.676
So sorry to interrupt.

23:06.011 --> 23:09.056
As I mentioned earlier,
I'm a writer like you.

23:09.139 --> 23:11.225
Well, not like you. Of course.

23:12.601 --> 23:14.061
But I think I could be.

23:15.187 --> 23:21.527
And I would be deeply in your debt
if you would deign to read my novella?

23:30.744 --> 23:33.121
My address and phone number are there,

23:33.205 --> 23:35.582
should you wish to discuss it
after reading.

23:40.963 --> 23:42.339
"Tears of the Anaren."

23:46.677 --> 23:47.678
Yes.

23:48.637 --> 23:49.763
That's right.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.379
Carl Longbottom?

24:22.462 --> 24:25.591
Speedy Courier delivery. Have a nice one.

24:26.175 --> 24:27.259
Thank you.

24:39.938 --> 24:42.941
"Dear Carl,
Thank you for sharing Tears of--

24:43.025 --> 24:46.195
Tears of the Anaren with me.

24:46.278 --> 24:50.282
As I read it, I found myself inspired to
type up a few suggestions for you.

24:50.365 --> 24:52.159
I used red ink so they'd be easy to find.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.994
Feel free to use or ignore them
as you wish.

24:54.077 --> 24:57.581
After all, it's your book,
exclamation point.

24:57.664 --> 24:58.916
Yours, Isaac Asimov.

24:59.499 --> 25:03.045
PS: I enjoyed your use of backstory."

27:31.693 --> 27:33.820
Yes. That's it.

27:33.904 --> 27:36.156
-Okay.
-That's you. This one's you.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.785
-A.E. A.E.!
-The hell is this?

27:41.161 --> 27:42.538
Good, you're all here.

27:43.539 --> 27:47.251
I know. I am late,
I am drunk, both inexcusable.

27:47.334 --> 27:49.795
But I have seen something.

27:49.878 --> 27:53.340
It's so simple.
Just a dot and a line and another dot.

27:53.423 --> 27:54.758
-That's it. That's all.
-Carl.

27:54.842 --> 27:55.843
For now.

27:55.926 --> 27:59.012
But the inevitable march of technology
will not be stemmed.

27:59.096 --> 28:02.850
Two dots become four,
become eight, become a million.

28:03.433 --> 28:04.518
A billion.

28:04.601 --> 28:09.857
Enough iridescent geometry
to create an entire world.

28:09.940 --> 28:10.983
No, no, no.

28:13.610 --> 28:14.695
Worlds.

28:16.029 --> 28:18.657
As countless as stars in the sky.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.618
Mountains, rivers, volcanoes.
Child's play.

28:21.702 --> 28:25.289
We will give birth to creatures
the likes of which have never been seen.

28:26.206 --> 28:30.085
And with the merest of motions,
we will control them.

28:31.170 --> 28:34.590
No. We will become them.

28:35.924 --> 28:39.678
Naturally, none of these wonders
will mean anything on their own.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.806
They will need to be infused with story.

28:42.890 --> 28:45.434
Conflict, romance, sex, violence.

28:45.517 --> 28:48.312
Everything that makes
the great religions great.

28:48.896 --> 28:53.233
But these stories can't simply be… this!

28:53.317 --> 28:55.110
These paltry, linear narratives.

28:55.194 --> 28:56.570
No!

28:56.653 --> 29:00.407
They will have to live
and breathe with the world itself.

29:04.036 --> 29:07.873
I have imagined
a new form of storytelling.

29:08.916 --> 29:10.584
Not a line,

29:10.667 --> 29:12.169
but a bolt of lightning,

29:12.252 --> 29:15.297
coruscating and fractalizing
into a thousand paths.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.216
Choices upon choices.

29:17.299 --> 29:21.428
A seamless melding of the author's will
and the reader's desire.

29:22.721 --> 29:26.350
I will create
this new kind of storytelling.

29:28.101 --> 29:30.229
I will gift it to you here.

29:34.691 --> 29:36.026
I have seen it.

29:37.694 --> 29:40.781
I have glimpsed through the veil of time!

29:48.080 --> 29:49.998
What the fuck are you talking about?

29:53.126 --> 29:55.337
-What?
-I didn't understand a goddamn--

29:55.420 --> 29:57.506
Did you understand any of that?
Either of you?

29:58.048 --> 30:01.510
Carl, your passion is admirable,

30:01.593 --> 30:05.264
but worlds coming to life on television?

30:05.764 --> 30:08.767
None of the good stuff is on TV. TV is…

30:08.851 --> 30:11.520
TV is shit. It's for morons.

31:53.455 --> 31:54.456
Thank you.

31:56.416 --> 31:57.417
Now…

31:58.877 --> 32:03.215
the award for best debut novel of 1973.

32:04.216 --> 32:07.386
And the Nebula goes to C.W. Longbottom…

32:07.469 --> 32:10.472
-Oh, my God.
-…Tears of the Anaren!

32:14.017 --> 32:15.435
Yes!

32:25.404 --> 32:27.406
Well deserved. Thoroughly enjoyed it.

32:27.489 --> 32:29.324
Thank you. I'm humbled. I'm humbled.

32:29.408 --> 32:30.909
-Congratulations.
-Truly.

32:30.993 --> 32:33.161
-Maybe we'll see you next year.
-It's an honor.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.665
Great job. Loved it.

32:37.249 --> 32:38.417
Congratulations.

32:39.501 --> 32:40.919
Hello, Carl.

32:44.131 --> 32:45.841
Sorry. C.W.

32:47.259 --> 32:48.260
A.E.

32:49.052 --> 32:50.762
It's actually just Anne now.

32:52.097 --> 32:56.810
Carl, congratulations. I read it
three times. You're an inspiration.

32:56.894 --> 32:57.895
You're too kind.

32:57.978 --> 33:00.230
Hardly. Can I get you another drink?

33:00.314 --> 33:02.191
Thank you. That would be lovely.

33:02.691 --> 33:05.694
-Bourbon, neat.
-Coming up for the big winner.

33:14.494 --> 33:15.495
You two…

33:16.580 --> 33:18.916
Good. That's good. Happy for you.

33:20.751 --> 33:23.295
I didn't expect to see either of you here.

33:23.378 --> 33:26.423
Well, my first book
is due to be published,

33:26.507 --> 33:29.593
so my editor got me tickets
so I could network.

33:31.803 --> 33:33.555
Peter's still writing too.

33:34.723 --> 33:36.558
He's not quite there yet, but…

33:36.642 --> 33:38.977
It'll be his turn before long.

33:42.189 --> 33:44.858
-By any chance, did you--
-I read it.

33:44.942 --> 33:48.904
Listen, I'm sure it comes off
like a poor man's Asimov,

33:48.987 --> 33:54.284
but my idea was to get
something published. Anything really.

33:54.368 --> 33:57.120
This way I'll have more opportunities

33:57.204 --> 33:59.957
to publish work that's a bit more me.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.083
You see what I mean?

34:02.751 --> 34:07.464
Obviously it worked out
a bit better than I expected, but--

34:07.548 --> 34:08.549
Carl.

34:10.092 --> 34:12.928
Tears of the Anaren didn't read
like a poor man's Asimov.

34:14.471 --> 34:16.389
It read exactly like Asimov.

34:23.813 --> 34:26.358
What a lovely compliment.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.944
Thank you. So kind of you to say.

34:52.926 --> 34:54.303
Well deserved.

34:54.386 --> 34:57.598
-I could not put it down.
-Yes. Thanks. Cheers.

34:57.681 --> 34:58.849
Congratulations.

35:16.200 --> 35:20.204
Chickens, chickens.
Plucked from the king's own forest.

35:20.287 --> 35:22.873
Taste of their succulent breasts.

35:22.956 --> 35:28.921
A mere 12.99, you can dine
on their fine, rotating flesh.

35:29.630 --> 35:31.381
Chickens, chickens.

35:31.465 --> 35:34.092
Excuse me. Are you C.W. Longbottom?

35:37.221 --> 35:39.932
-Do I know you?
-No, but I'm a huge fan of yours.

35:40.015 --> 35:41.892
I have read every one of your books.

35:41.975 --> 35:43.936
My name's Ian Grimm, and this is--

35:44.019 --> 35:46.396
Hey, dickhead. Pay attention.

35:49.149 --> 35:50.234
This is the guy?

35:51.443 --> 35:53.362
Yep. This is the guy.

35:55.113 --> 35:58.200
So, what--

35:58.867 --> 36:00.244
What do you want?

36:02.287 --> 36:05.707
Have you ever thought about writing
for a video game?
