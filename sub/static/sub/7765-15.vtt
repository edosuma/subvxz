Rigby: YO, WE ABOUT TO SHOWCASE
ENGLISH UP IN THIS JOINT!

08:43.120 --> 08:45.620
( POP MUSIC PLAYS )
( TYPING RHYTHMICALLY )

08:45.720 --> 08:48.220
DEAR BENSON, HERE'S A LETTER,
WE BEGIN WITH "MY BAD"

08:48.320 --> 08:49.940
MY BAD
WE'D LIKE TO KEEP IT FORMAL

08:50.040 --> 08:51.460
BUT LIVING
IN THE MODERN WORLD

08:51.560 --> 08:53.560
HAS FRESHENED UP
THE NORMAL WAY

08:52.680 --> 08:55.760
OF SAYIN' WHAT WE WANNA SAY
IN TEXT, EâMAIL, AND CHAT

08:54.960 --> 08:56.380
AND WE SHOULD
KEEP IT CONCISE

08:56.480 --> 08:58.480
THAT'S THE PRICE
TO WRITE A LETTER

08:57.600 --> 08:58.780
BUT WHATEVER,
S'ALL GOOD

08:58.880 --> 09:00.880
'CAUSE SLANG
CAN DO IT BETTER

09:00.120 --> 09:01.180
YO, WHAT'S UP, APPLE?

09:01.280 --> 09:03.280
YOU READY
TO BREAK THIS THING DOWN?!

09:02.680 --> 09:04.340
( Distorted )
DRâDRâDROP THE BEAT!

09:04.440 --> 09:07.700
OUR HISTORY, YOU SEE,
IS STUDY ONLY FOR A TEST

09:07.800 --> 09:09.860
NO BIGGIE, BUT LIKE
A MUSIC

09:09.960 --> 09:11.700
AHH, SLANG IS A'IGHT

09:11.800 --> 09:13.800
MY STRAIGHTâUP CHILLIN'
SWAGGER'S KILLIN'

09:12.960 --> 09:14.960
STREET TALK, AND IT'S TIGHT

09:14.200 --> 09:15.660
SO, DEAR BENSON,
HERE'S A LETTER

09:15.760 --> 09:18.840
WHERE WITHIN WE BUST OUT
BUST OUT

09:17.880 --> 09:20.960
INFORMAL LANGUAGE LIVIN'
<i>LAO SHI,LAOâCHIC!</i>

09:20.280 --> 09:23.360
YO, DON'T BE STRESSIN' TIX!
WE'LL HELP YOU GET A BOO

09:22.600 --> 09:24.060
'CAUSE WE KNOW
SOME ADULT CHICKS

09:24.160 --> 09:26.300
PARAGRAPH THREE,
IT'S THE SUMMARIZATION

09:26.400 --> 09:28.400
FORMAL HAS A PLACE,
BUT IT'LL FACE STAGNATION

09:28.040 --> 09:29.340
Boy #1:
SLANG'S GOT A BANG

09:29.440 --> 09:30.980
Boy #2:  IT'S A LITTLE SLICE
OF HEAVEN

09:31.080 --> 09:33.080
SO, SINCERELY,
CATCH YOU LATER, AND PEACE OUT

09:32.440 --> 09:35.580
WE'RE CLASS SEVEN

09:35.680 --> 09:37.580
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

09:37.680 --> 09:41.220
AH, BENSON, I'VE NEVER SEEN
SUCH AMAZING DISPLAY.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.420
OH!

09:42.520 --> 09:45.660
AND THE VULGAR SLANG
THAT MOST AMERICANS USE!

09:45.760 --> 09:47.580
UH...
MR. BENSON WORK VERY HARD

09:47.680 --> 09:50.260
TO TEACH US ALL FACETS
OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.300
THIS PERFORMANCE
IS DEDICATED TO MR. BENSON,

09:52.400 --> 09:53.900
TO WHOM
WE OWE ALL THE CREDIT.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.380
PLEASE RETURN NEXT YEAR

09:55.480 --> 09:59.600
AND SHARE MORE OF YOUR
VULGAR RAPS WITH OUR STUDENTS.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.820
I'D LOVE TO.
RIGBY, YOU PASS.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.180
YOU ALL PASS.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.620
( SCHOOL BELL RINGS )

10:06.720 --> 10:08.720
WELL, RIGBY, NORMALLY
LEAVING SCHOOL FOR A MONTH

10:08.800 --> 10:10.800
WOULD BE GROUNDS
FOR EXPULSION,

10:10.200 --> 10:11.540
BUT I WANT YOU
OUT OF HERE,

10:11.640 --> 10:14.000
AND YOU TECHNICALLY DID PASS
A FOREIGNâLANGUAGE CLASS.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.220
SO, WHATEVER.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.320
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CREDITS.
YOU PASS.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.940
<i>TAI HAO LE!</i>

10:18.040 --> 10:20.780
ONLY ONE MORE CREDIT,
AND YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.100
YOU KNOW, I ADMIT TO BEING
A BIT TOUCHED BY YOUR RESOLVE.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.940
IN FACT, YOU KIND OF REMIND ME
OF A YOUNG ME.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.820
I PAAAAAASSED!

10:28.920 --> 10:30.180
( SCREAMS )

10:30.280 --> 10:32.660
RIGBYYYYY!
