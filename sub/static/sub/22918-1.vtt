[ship's horn blows]

00:34.320 --> 00:35.880
[reporter 1] Unprecedented scenes here,

00:35.960 --> 00:38.440
as photographers
from all over the world...

00:38.520 --> 00:41.040
[reporter 2] The Queen and the Duke
of Edinburgh hide from the world's eyes...

00:41.120 --> 00:44.080
[reporter 3] ...rumors of a crisis
in the marriage. Now the eyes of the world

00:44.160 --> 00:45.760
turn towards the Royal Yacht...

00:45.840 --> 00:49.360
[reporter 4] ...intense speculation about
relations between Her Majesty the Queen

00:49.440 --> 00:50.480
and the Duke of Edinburgh.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.440
[thunder rumbling]

00:53.440 --> 00:54.440
[Elizabeth] Right.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.360
[creaking]

00:58.480 --> 00:59.920
No, no, no. I see.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.880
[glass rattles]

01:04.840 --> 01:06.960
Yes. Thank you.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.640

-[creaking]
-[storm continues]

01:25.400 --> 01:27.560
[Elizabeth] That was
the palace press secretary.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.600
In his view, the steps that we've taken
haven't quite done the trick.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.520
The rumors still haven't gone away.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.600
I think we both agree,
it can't go on like this.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.720
So I thought
we might take this opportunity,

02:04.800 --> 02:07.400
without children, without distraction...

02:08.199 --> 02:09.919
to lay our cards on the table...

02:12.480 --> 02:14.280
and talk frankly, for once...

02:15.560 --> 02:19.360
about what needs to change
to make this marriage work.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.840
All right. Who goes first?

02:24.320 --> 02:27.800
Stupid question. If I've learned
one thing by now, it's that I go second.

02:29.560 --> 02:32.560
If I am to go first,
that's where I'd start.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.920
Your complaining.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.800
-My complaining?
-It's incessant.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.720
Whining and whingeing like a child.

02:40.800 --> 02:41.920
Are you surprised?

02:42.520 --> 02:45.840
The way those god-awful mustaches that
run the palace continue to infantilize me.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.920
-If you weren't behaving like an infant...
-Giving me lists, sending me instructions.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.480
Can you imagine anything more
humiliating?

02:50.560 --> 02:53.680
Yes. As a matter of fact, I can.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.320
I've learned more about humiliation
in the last few weeks

02:58.400 --> 03:00.120
than I hoped I would in a lifetime.

03:02.120 --> 03:05.000
I've never felt more alone
than I have in the past five months.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.920
And why do you think that was?

03:07.760 --> 03:10.800
-Because of your behavior.
-Because you sent me away.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.880
-Yes, and why do you think that was?
-I don't know, Elizabeth. You tell me.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.600
-Because you're lost.
-[glass thuds]

03:17.680 --> 03:19.800
You're lost in your role,
and you're lost in yourself.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.520
Look...

03:28.720 --> 03:31.560
I realize this marriage has turned out
to be something quite different

03:31.640 --> 03:33.760
-to what we both imagined.
-Understatement.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.280
And that we find ourselves in a...

03:39.360 --> 03:40.200
Prison?

03:42.560 --> 03:45.640
A situation... which is unique.

03:46.640 --> 03:49.040
The exit route
which is open to everyone else...

03:49.120 --> 03:49.960
Divorce.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.880
Yes... divorce.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.680
It's not an option for us.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.640
Ever.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.760
[thunder rumbling]

04:05.360 --> 04:06.200
No.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.040
So, what would make it easier on you?

04:19.800 --> 04:22.480
To be in... not out.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.960
What will it take?

04:30.800 --> 04:32.280
You're asking my price?

04:35.840 --> 04:39.560
I'm asking... what it will take.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.240
Remind me. You fly first to?

05:59.320 --> 06:01.000
-Gibraltar.
-[Elizabeth] Ah.

06:01.080 --> 06:04.280
-And from there?
-Entebbe. Then Mombasa.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.760
-Ah, yes. To meet the Royal Yacht.
-[chuckles] Yes.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.240
-I've told you this already.
-Maybe I've forgotten.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.120
Maybe you should listen
a little more carefully next time.

06:15.160 --> 06:19.000
From there we sail to Port Victoria.
Then on to Colombo, New Guinea.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.640
Then Australia.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.520
-Yes. To open the Olympics.
-As instructed.

06:25.960 --> 06:32.000
Then Gambia, Gibraltar again,
and finally, uh, Lisbon. [claps]

06:32.080 --> 06:33.080
Goodness me.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.600
Five months.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.280
Ugh.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.520
-Thank you.
-What for?

06:41.600 --> 06:42.840
[Elizabeth] For doing the tour...

06:44.000 --> 06:45.520
stepping into my shoes.

06:46.880 --> 06:47.880
It is important.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.080
Actually, now I've made the decision,
I'm rather looking forward to it.

06:52.640 --> 06:56.280
And, [claps] we've managed to add
another leg to the journey.

06:56.360 --> 07:01.200
-The South Pacific. And the Antarctic.
-Boys will be boys.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.040
Excuse me. Sub-zero temperatures.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.040
-Men will be men.
-[Elizabeth chuckles]

07:06.120 --> 07:09.120
[chattering]

07:09.640 --> 07:13.760
[Philip]  The annual presentation party
for members of the diplomatic corps.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.120
-Do you remember last year?
-[Elizabeth] Yes, I do, unfortunately.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.960
-It did go on rather.
-[Philip] Five hours.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.080
-One moment, Your Majesty.
-Oh, dear.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.400
[Charteris] The last guests
are just arriving.

07:27.760 --> 07:28.720
You look nice.

07:29.880 --> 07:30.720
Do I?

07:31.520 --> 07:33.120
Even in full battle dress?

07:34.560 --> 07:36.840
That stuff used to wear you.
Now you wear it.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.320
Oh, dear. It's all right, it's all right.
I'll do it.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.760
-What is it?
-Zip.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.360
Everybody turn around, please.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.040
[guests muttering]

07:55.200 --> 07:56.400
Stop it!

07:58.160 --> 07:59.640
[Charteris] Ready for you now, ma'am.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.640
[chattering]

08:05.080 --> 08:07.000
[fanfare plays]

08:13.080 --> 08:16.000
[Nasser on radio in Arabic]
My fellow Egyptians.

08:17.840 --> 08:22.600
The Suez Canal, which flows through
our country like a major artery...

08:24.120 --> 08:27.240
was built by
our fathers and grandfathers

08:27.920 --> 08:29.760
and belongs to us!

08:29.840 --> 08:31.440
[crowd cheering on radio]

08:32.440 --> 08:34.280
[monkey chirping]

08:34.440 --> 08:38.799
[Nasser on radio in Arabic]  But the
company that purportedly owns this canal

08:38.880 --> 08:41.400
is British and French.

08:42.760 --> 08:46.000
Well, I say they do not own it.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.040
They stole it.

08:51.160 --> 08:55.280
I imagined I had seen
Ferdinand de Lesseps...

08:56.240 --> 08:58.080
[soldier in Arabic] That's the code word.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.960
Ferdinand de Lesseps.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.520
[crowd cheering]

09:03.080 --> 09:05.800
Ferdinand de Lesseps...

09:07.240 --> 09:12.440
the engineer
who built the canal in 1869...

09:13.400 --> 09:15.160
-[loud bang]
-[soldier speaking in Arabic]

09:16.000 --> 09:18.440
[Nasser on radio in Arabic]  We have fought
for years to eliminate

09:18.520 --> 09:20.240
the odious effects of the past

09:20.320 --> 09:23.080
of the colonialism and despotism...

09:23.160 --> 09:25.720
[man] Excuse me. What the devil
do you think you're doing?

09:25.800 --> 09:28.400
-...which have ruled us for centuries!
-[man] Take your hands--

09:31.200 --> 09:32.720
[crowd cheering]

09:32.800 --> 09:36.640
Tonight, fellow countrymen,
I am proud to inform you...

09:38.760 --> 09:42.120
Gentlemen.
Your hands above your heads, please!

09:43.520 --> 09:46.280
...we have taken back the Suez Canal!

09:46.360 --> 09:48.880
[cheering]

09:48.960 --> 09:51.000
It is now in Egyptian hands.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.760
[cheering]

09:52.840 --> 09:57.840
And it will be run by Egyptians!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.720
Because today our time has come...

10:02.200 --> 10:07.800
for freedom from colonial oppressors!

10:07.880 --> 10:09.680
Freedom from colonial thieves!

10:09.760 --> 10:11.560
Freedom!

10:14.520 --> 10:15.520
[sighs]

10:15.920 --> 10:16.760
[creaking]

10:18.840 --> 10:20.920
[panting and puffing]

10:27.560 --> 10:29.840
-Oh.
-[Philip] Oh, what?

10:32.640 --> 10:33.640
[Philip exhales]

10:34.360 --> 10:37.160
-I've woken up in this bed.
-[Philip chuckles] Yes, you have.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.400
[both chuckle]

10:44.400 --> 10:47.400
-Where do you get your energy from?
-Oh, I don't know.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.320
[Philip grunts, exhales]

10:53.760 --> 10:54.840
I am going to miss you.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
Come back to bed.

11:02.280 --> 11:05.200
No, I can't, darling.
I've got 20 star jumps to do.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.120
You can do them here.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.120
-Can I?
-Mm-hm.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.480
Oh, well, why not?

11:14.560 --> 11:16.040
-[Elizabeth laughs]
-[door opens]

11:17.880 --> 11:19.160
-No! No!
-[Elizabeth] No, no!

11:19.240 --> 11:20.960
-[Philip] Out! Out!
-[valet] Sorry, sir.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.920
-Thank you.
-[valet] Out, everyone.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.120
[Elizabeth laughs]

11:24.200 --> 11:26.720
[Philip laughs]

11:49.920 --> 11:50.920
[closes pen lid]

11:56.200 --> 11:59.400
Right. My car or yours?
Or is that a stupid question?

11:59.480 --> 12:02.120
-It's a stupid question.
-[Mike laughs] All right.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.440
Heads or tails to see who drives back.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.880
-Whoop.
-Tails.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.040
-Heads. Your wife. You lose.
-[laughs]

12:09.600 --> 12:10.640
[Philip] Now, now.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.080
She and I are getting
on rather well at the moment.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.800
-Oh, really?
-Yes, really.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.720
[Mike] Wish I could say the same.

12:21.920 --> 12:25.440
[provost]  We're very fortunate to have
a former pupil, and now

12:25.520 --> 12:29.640
Prime Minister, come to say
a few words to us this morning.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.840
-Sir Anthony.
-[applauding]

12:38.760 --> 12:39.840
Thank you, Sir Claude.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.760
Now there's been a lot of talk recently

12:44.840 --> 12:48.360
about how much the world
has changed since the war...

12:49.880 --> 12:53.680
and how much society in Britain
has changed...

12:55.160 --> 12:57.240
or how much it jolly well ought to change.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.920
[students laugh]

12:59.000 --> 13:02.920
And that places like Eton
should no longer be seen

13:03.000 --> 13:06.240
as the birthplace of Britain's leaders.

13:07.880 --> 13:11.360
To which I, as a fully paid up egalitarian

13:11.440 --> 13:15.000
and progressive member
of the Conservative Party say...

13:16.000 --> 13:18.520
what a lot of absolute nonsense.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.240
[students laugh]

13:20.960 --> 13:22.280
[church bells ring]

13:23.040 --> 13:26.000
[Eden]  If Britain's leaders
aren't coming from Eton,

13:26.600 --> 13:29.000
then where should they be coming from?

13:29.080 --> 13:34.240
You see before you
the 16th Etonian Prime Minister.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.560
Sixteen... out of 40.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.040
Not a bad percentage.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.600
Harrow, incidentally,
only accounts for seven.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.840
[students laugh]

13:45.800 --> 13:49.000
[Eden]  Well, yes, you might
well argue that as a social pool,

13:49.080 --> 13:50.680
it is a bit narrow.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.920
But narrowness at the top
is not necessarily a bad thing.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.800
For as any serviceman will tell you,

13:59.200 --> 14:00.600
in battle,

14:01.120 --> 14:05.000
when the heat is on,
one needs a shorthand,

14:05.560 --> 14:08.400
a shared language and understanding.

14:08.920 --> 14:09.920
A clarity.

14:10.880 --> 14:16.200
Eton has, for generations now,
provided Britain with that clarity.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.440
That code.

14:20.440 --> 14:24.440
-That... shared language.
-[students murmuring]

14:25.240 --> 14:28.280
[whispers] Sir, Nasser has seized control
of the Suez Canal

14:28.360 --> 14:30.640
and taken command
of the company's offices.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.760
I'm afraid we shall have
to leave it there, gentlemen.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.960
[students murmuring]

14:38.040 --> 14:39.040
Provost.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.360
[shouting in the distance]

14:55.600 --> 14:58.920
[footsteps approaching]

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
[knock on door]

15:01.280 --> 15:03.120
-[valet] You asked to see me, ma'am?
-Ah.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.120
Yes, I wanted to leave this letter
and this gift

15:06.200 --> 15:08.760
somewhere that the Duke of Edinburgh
might find it.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.560
Preferably on the airplane.
I thought perhaps in his luggage?

15:12.080 --> 15:16.240
That travels separately. I would suggest
placing it inside his briefcase.

15:16.320 --> 15:19.480
Yes. Of course. Well, just let me know
when the coast is clear.

15:19.560 --> 15:23.320
Actually, now, ma'am.
He has an appointment with his tailor,

15:23.400 --> 15:25.680
followed by the lunch club
with Commander Parker.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.880
Yes. It's Thursday. Of course.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.560
-Ma'am.
-[clears throat]

15:38.960 --> 15:42.000
[man] ...boot polish, binoculars,
rifle and ammunition as well.

15:42.880 --> 15:43.720
[man 2] Ma'am.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.360
Ma'am.

15:48.960 --> 15:49.800
Ah.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.160
Your Majesty.
We've just had a call from Downing Street.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.720
The Prime Minister has asked
to see you urgently.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.160
So sorry to have kept you waiting.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.440
[Eden] Your Majesty.

17:33.760 --> 17:39.400
[clears throat] Late last night,
President Nasser's men stormed the offices

17:39.480 --> 17:44.640
of the Suez Canal Company
and have now seized control of the canal.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.840
He claims to be doing this
on behalf of the Egyptian people.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.640
In reality, it is the act of a thief.

17:54.120 --> 17:58.280
A petty hoodlum, showing off
for the benefit of the Soviets.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.080
But we've dealt with worse.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.800
Appropriate measures
are being put in place.

18:06.120 --> 18:10.680
We will simply pay the pilots
to leave their posts.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.400
-Pilots?
-Suez Canal pilots, ma'am.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.360
Highly-skilled mariners,
British and French,

18:20.440 --> 18:24.760
who take the helm of any ship entering
the canal to ensure its safe passage

18:24.840 --> 18:28.280
through extremely challenging
and narrow waterways.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.640
Ah. I see.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.000
The Egyptians are not a seafaring people.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.600
They don't have the skills,
and they don't have the men.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.800
Taking the pilots away
will simply paralyze the canal.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.320
And it won't be long before...

18:43.320 --> 18:48.520
President Nasser will come back
repentant and humiliated.

18:51.680 --> 18:52.680
If you say so.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.960
I do, ma'am. Hm.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.320
[bell rings]

19:04.280 --> 19:05.320
[door opens]

19:07.760 --> 19:08.640
[door closes]

19:13.000 --> 19:15.960
It's a hell of a gamble.
I hope you told him so.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.960
-[Elizabeth] What?
-The Prime Minister.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.560
[Elizabeth] Yes.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.480
Pulling the pilots out of the Suez Canal.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.520
How do you know he even intends to?

19:27.320 --> 19:28.320
Aha.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.840
Oh, no, don't tell me.
Contacts from your lunch club.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.040
No need to say it like that.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.040
Well, information like that
could only have come from inside Cabinet.

19:36.120 --> 19:38.960
Or high up in the Foreign Office.
Or the intelligence services.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.320
Our members come
from all corners, darling.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.840
Well, I'm not entirely persuaded
that this club is a good thing.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.040
It keeps me busy. Keeps me informed.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.080
It keeps me sane.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.360
It's a very good thing.
Would you like to know

19:53.440 --> 19:56.320
-why navigating the canal is so difficult?
-Perhaps another time.

19:56.400 --> 20:00.960
People think it's just the water pressure,
but hydraulics are only the half of it.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.440
The canal is narrow.
The ships are vast, great big things.

20:04.960 --> 20:08.400
Uh, the tide is diurnal one end,
seasonal at the other.

20:08.480 --> 20:12.520
So the wind whips in off the desert,
your bow's always to the weather bank.

20:12.600 --> 20:17.080
The pilots have to track a steady course
for the best part of a hundred miles.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.960
Excuse me. What are you doing?
Put them back.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.320
[footman] Sir.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.040
They're my tankers.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.240
I mean, it takes them seven years
to learn how to do it.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.480
-Where are you going?
-[Elizabeth sighs] I'm tired.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.880
It's our last night in five months.

20:40.720 --> 20:44.240
[man] A bit more. A bit more. All right.

20:45.040 --> 20:45.880
Michael, what's that?

20:46.680 --> 20:48.960
-DC-4.
-[Mike] Good man.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.480
[Eileen] You know we will be separated
for Christmas again.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.920
I know. Not ideal.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
[Eileen] And your daughter's birthday.
Again.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.360
I'll call this time. I won't forget.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.400
[Mike laughs]

21:01.480 --> 21:03.960
And our anniversary. Again.

21:05.800 --> 21:06.680
[Mike sighs]

21:07.240 --> 21:08.760
What do you want me to say, Eileen?

21:09.160 --> 21:11.160
You were as excited as I was
when Philip offered me this job.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.480
You thought it would be good for me,
good for all of us.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.080
I didn't expect the job
to become your life.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.440
[Mike] When I get back,
I will make it up to you. I promise.

21:37.240 --> 21:38.400
[Michael] Bye, Dad!

21:39.000 --> 21:41.320
[Julie] Goodbye, Daddy! Bye!

21:42.400 --> 21:43.400
[Michael] Bye!

21:48.680 --> 21:50.720
[crowd cheering]

21:55.120 --> 21:56.000
[camera clicks]

22:23.360 --> 22:25.560
-Ah. Hello.
-Your Majesty.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.560
-Welcome aboard, sir.
-Hello.

22:29.000 --> 22:29.840
Good to see you.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.040
Right, well. I suppose we'd better
say goodbye properly.

22:34.640 --> 22:35.480
Charles.

22:38.840 --> 22:39.760
[Philip] Hm.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.920
We're not in front of the cameras now,
are we, Charles?

22:50.400 --> 22:51.240
No.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.400
[Philip] Come here.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.880
Be a good boy.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.080
-Look after your sister.
-[Charles] Yes, I will.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.040
[Philip] Kiss.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.120
Come on, darling.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.800
-When you're ready, sir.
-[Philip] Thank you.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.320
[Elizabeth] Right, well, uh...

23:32.040 --> 23:33.520
[stutters] We won't keep you.

23:34.320 --> 23:35.520
Have a safe journey.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.520
-[Mike] Are you all right?
-Splendid.

23:48.240 --> 23:51.000
[Mike] I tell you, the idiot that came up
with the idea of marriage

23:51.080 --> 23:52.920
has a lot to answer for.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.320
Well, you know what they say...

24:04.200 --> 24:06.720
"Marriage is a wonderful institution,"
but let's face it,

24:07.720 --> 24:08.920
who wants to live in an institution?

24:43.440 --> 24:45.360
[indistinct shouting]

24:50.320 --> 24:52.200
[man shouting]

25:00.600 --> 25:01.600
Assalamu alaikum.

25:01.680 --> 25:04.320
[in Russian] President Nasser.
A pleasure to meet you.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.640
[in Russian] Thank you, Lieutenant.
The pleasure is all mine.

25:09.680 --> 25:13.120
[radio announcer]  In the wake of President
Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal,

25:13.200 --> 25:16.160
Russian mariners have been
pouring into Egypt.

25:16.240 --> 25:20.120
These Soviet master seamen
are now training Egyptian pilots,

25:20.200 --> 25:23.560
who are proving to be more adept sailors
than many predicted.

25:23.640 --> 25:27.360
Hopes that the loss of British and French
trained pilots would close the waterways

25:27.440 --> 25:28.280
have been dashed.

25:29.040 --> 25:33.120
Britain now finds herself at the center
of rising tensions between East and West.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.360
And with only six weeks of oil reserves,

25:35.440 --> 25:38.200
in an increasingly
desperate situation at home.

25:38.280 --> 25:42.680
The United States is refusing to be drawn
on its position in the escalating crisis.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.880
But with the Soviet Union
backing President Nasser,

25:45.960 --> 25:49.160
commentators are calling this
the most serious international crisis

25:49.240 --> 25:52.080
the world has faced
since the Second World War.

25:55.800 --> 25:59.400
-[man] Yes, yes.
-[indistinct chattering]

26:00.280 --> 26:01.120
[knock on door]

26:01.200 --> 26:02.800
-Yes.
-[secretary] The Chancellor, sir.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.160
Harold.

26:06.840 --> 26:11.720
I'm afraid that, uh, "when sorrows come,
they come not single spies..."

26:11.800 --> 26:14.680
-"...but in battalions."
-Indeed.

26:15.360 --> 26:21.200
As the world now knows, Nasser's
ragtag collection of part-time pilots

26:21.280 --> 26:26.160
have somehow managed
to retain control of the canal.

26:26.240 --> 26:31.960
And to make matters worse, it seems
they've been helped by the Russians.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.680
If they get away with this,
we will be a complete laughing stock.

26:35.760 --> 26:40.160
Nasser will be able
to close the canal at any time

26:40.240 --> 26:44.640
and cut us off from the oil
on which we absolutely depend.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.240
We must, um...

26:47.400 --> 26:49.280
[exhales] We must attack.

26:49.640 --> 26:54.120
We have no alternative.
We must attack. Swiftly and decisively.

26:54.200 --> 26:57.480
We must restore the status quo.

27:00.760 --> 27:01.600
What do you say?

27:07.920 --> 27:09.600
I say it's the right thing...

27:12.280 --> 27:13.520
for the country...

27:15.320 --> 27:17.440
and for you, personally...

27:18.960 --> 27:21.360
to finally step out
from Winston's long shadow.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.440
"Take but degree away...

27:30.480 --> 27:32.480
untune that string..."

27:33.200 --> 27:35.840
"...and, hark, what discord follows."

27:38.720 --> 27:39.800
[Eden]  Military action!

27:40.680 --> 27:41.880
Military action!

27:41.960 --> 27:47.280
There is only one proven way
to deal with fascists.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.160
[all] Hear, hear!

27:49.240 --> 27:50.280
[Nutting] And while I'm sure...

27:50.360 --> 27:54.200
While I'm sure we all commend
our Prime Minister's confidence,

27:54.280 --> 27:58.600
he seems to forget
that there can be no military action

27:58.680 --> 28:00.800
without support from the UN.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.400
Support we do not have.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.960
We cannot go to war alone.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.200
[indistinct chattering]

28:26.600 --> 28:29.080
Ah. Don't you look smart?

28:30.160 --> 28:32.000
-You've got your presents?
-Yes.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.440
[Elizabeth] Mommy was hoping
to come with you,

28:34.520 --> 28:36.160
but I've got very behind.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.560
So, could you send my apologies

28:37.640 --> 28:39.200
-to Mrs. Parker?
-Of course, ma'am.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.520
Enjoy yourselves. Mm?

28:46.120 --> 28:46.960
And be good!

28:49.320 --> 28:51.080
[nanny speaking indistinctly]

28:51.160 --> 28:53.320
[nanny] Who wants to play I Spy
in the car?

29:00.120 --> 29:02.840
-[indistinct chattering]
-[woman] Come here, you.

29:03.800 --> 29:04.920
[Eileen] There you are!

29:05.000 --> 29:06.480
[whooping]

29:06.560 --> 29:08.920
[children laughing and screaming]

29:09.000 --> 29:11.120
[boy] Pow, pow, pow, pow!

29:11.200 --> 29:13.520
-[phone rings]
-[boy] Pow, pow, pow!

29:13.600 --> 29:14.920
Daddy!

29:15.000 --> 29:18.120
-Is that Daddy? Shall we speak to him?
-[Julie] Yes!

29:21.520 --> 29:22.600
Hello?

29:29.320 --> 29:31.480
Uh, no. Seven o'clock will be fine.

29:32.840 --> 29:33.680
Thank you.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.920
It wasn't Daddy.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.400
I'm sure he'll call later, all right?

29:41.480 --> 29:46.440
â™ª  Happy birthday to you â™ª

29:46.520 --> 29:48.280
-[Eileen] Hip, hip!
-[children] Hooray!

29:48.360 --> 29:49.800
-[Eileen] Hip, hip!
-[children] Hooray!

29:49.880 --> 29:51.360
-[Eileen] Hip, hip!
-[children] Hooray!

29:51.440 --> 29:54.000
-[Eileen] Who wants a slice of cake?
-[children] Me!

29:54.840 --> 29:58.800
-Why didn't Daddy telephone?
-I don't know.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.240
He must be very busy.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.240
He loves you very much.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.000
Right?

30:08.920 --> 30:09.840
Go to sleep now.

30:12.600 --> 30:13.520
Good girl.

30:38.640 --> 30:39.920
[exhales]

30:48.960 --> 30:51.280
[phone ringing]

30:56.560 --> 30:57.560
[woman groans]

31:05.880 --> 31:06.880
[exhales]

31:07.400 --> 31:08.320
Hello?

31:10.080 --> 31:11.280
[Elizabeth on phone]  Would you like
to know the principal,

31:11.360 --> 31:12.800
perhaps only, advantage

31:12.880 --> 31:15.960
of being the Chief Patron
of the English Bowling Association?

31:17.840 --> 31:18.720
[tray clatters]

31:20.200 --> 31:21.200
Go on.

31:22.720 --> 31:27.120
My fellow patrons are frequently too old
or too ill to meet.

31:27.200 --> 31:30.880
Which means I find myself
unexpectedly free for lunch.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.560
[Margaret]  Well, I've just woken up.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.280
-It's 11:30.
-Yes.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.800
I got in at four.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.840
I left strict instructions
not to be disturbed by anyone.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.600
[raises voice] For any reason.

31:46.800 --> 31:50.480
I can see a conspiracy to drive me insane
is well underway.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.240
[Margaret]  We started at Mirabelle,

31:53.320 --> 31:56.760
and then went to the 400,
and then ended up at Les Ambassadeurs.

31:58.440 --> 31:59.360
Who's "we"?

32:00.040 --> 32:02.080
Just Colin, Johnny, Judy Montagu.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.320
-[Elizabeth] Margot?
-Hm.

32:05.760 --> 32:07.720
Is it possible that you're still drunk?

32:08.920 --> 32:11.760
Do you know,
I think I might be, slightly.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.880
-You need to be more careful.
-Yes, quite right.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.520
Grain and grape don't mix.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.600
No.

32:21.600 --> 32:24.840
I meant about where you're seen.
And with whom.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.680
You're drinking far more than you used to.

32:30.560 --> 32:32.080
Why do you think that is?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Because I'm unhappier than I used to be.

32:36.560 --> 32:39.160
And why is that?
Because I am still unmarried.

32:39.240 --> 32:42.080
And why is that? Oh, because you
denied me my perfect match.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.040
That's not fair.

32:46.520 --> 32:49.600
As your sister, I would have been
perfectly happy for you to marry Peter.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.560
-What? [scoffs]
-It was the Crown that forbade it.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.240
Not to mention the fact
that he was a little old.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.400
-Not really from the right--
-Don't you dare say "background."

33:01.240 --> 33:04.960
Well... I just think it might have all
come back to haunt you.

33:05.320 --> 33:08.080
What, did Philip's Nazi sisters
come back to haunt him?

33:08.160 --> 33:11.120
Or his lunatic mother?
Or his womanizing, bankrupt father?

33:17.480 --> 33:18.480
[sighs] How is he?

33:20.760 --> 33:22.920
-Philip?
-Yes.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.280
He's fine. I think.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.160
What, you don't know?

33:34.320 --> 33:35.600
Where is he now?

33:36.120 --> 33:37.000
Ceylon.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.600
-No, Malaya.
-You don't know that either.

33:43.680 --> 33:44.760
No.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.560
-Is that bad?
-It's just a little odd.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.480
A little remote. A little chilly.

33:55.920 --> 33:59.160
-Doesn't he write to you?
-Hm. He's not much of a writer.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.240
-Neither of us is.
-[scoffs]

34:05.160 --> 34:06.280
Mike telephoned from Mombasa

34:06.360 --> 34:08.600
-to say that they'd arrived safely.
-Who's Mike?

34:09.320 --> 34:10.639
His private secretary.

34:11.239 --> 34:13.360
-Oh, yes. That little Australian.
-Yes.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.480
-What do you make of him?
-I'm not sure I make anything of him.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.600
He's Mike.

34:23.080 --> 34:25.120
We were all very close in Malta.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.880
The children sometimes play together now.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.400
Philip says he'd be lost without him.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.480
Oh, just as long as he isn't lost
because of him.

34:33.560 --> 34:34.520
What does that mean?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.320
It means he's got something
of a reputation.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.960
-Who, Mike?
-Yes, Mike.

34:39.760 --> 34:42.560
Isn't he thick as thieves
with that sinister osteopath?

34:42.639 --> 34:44.719
-What osteopath?
-The one who knows everyone.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.000
Always arranging gentlemen's weekends
here and there with...

34:49.800 --> 34:51.679
-actresses and...
-Ballerinas.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.440
Yes.

34:55.520 --> 34:56.560
How did you know that?

35:07.040 --> 35:09.480
[Mountbatten]  I don't mind telling you,
everything else

35:09.560 --> 35:11.280
I've achieved in life:

35:11.360 --> 35:12.880
Viceroy of India,

35:13.480 --> 35:16.320
Supreme Allied Commander
in Southeast Asia,

35:16.400 --> 35:18.680
even First Sea Lord...

35:19.360 --> 35:22.080
all pale by comparison to this.

35:23.640 --> 35:29.880
To match my father and be Admiral
of the Fleet, really is most satisfying.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.720
-Sir.
-I said we were not to be disturbed.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.160
It's the Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs, sir.

35:37.320 --> 35:38.600
He said it was urgent.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.760
I'm afraid I didn't know
who else to come and see.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.200
[Mountbatten] Not at all.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.320
Come on up.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.600
-Hello, darling.
-Don't stay up.

35:51.680 --> 35:52.640
Won't be back until late.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.200
[Mountbatten] Have fun.
Where are you off to?

35:54.280 --> 35:56.760
I thought we agreed,
mysteries on both sides.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.640
-We did.
-Then don't ask.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.920
[Mountbatten] May I present
Anthony Nutting?

36:01.120 --> 36:02.680
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.280
-[Edwina] How do you do?
-Lady Mountbatten.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.360
-I entirely approve of foreign affairs.
-Now, now, darling.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.480
[Edwina] Mm, this one's
even more handsome than Eden.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.920
A cabinet of dishes.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.240
-[laughs] You're very kind.
-[Edwina] How was the fitting, dear?

36:14.920 --> 36:16.920
I'll let you into a secret, Mr. Nutting.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.920
My husband cares for nothing and no one

36:19.000 --> 36:21.120
in quite the same way he cares
for his uniforms.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.720
We're fortunate enough to have
a ballroom in this house.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.120
But is it the largest room here? No.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.280
That's reserved for my husband's uniforms.

36:29.720 --> 36:33.720
[inhales] One can only ask oneself
what it all compensates for.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.600
I should have thought that was obvious.

36:37.080 --> 36:40.440
The gaping wounds left by the simplest
encounter with you, my dear.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.680
[Edwina] Hm.

36:42.680 --> 36:43.600
Shall we?

36:44.000 --> 36:47.200
[Nutting] I'm not saying I condone
how Nasser is behaving, not at all.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.760
The man clearly needs to be
put back in his place.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.600
But my greater concern
is that our Prime Minister's response

36:52.680 --> 36:56.760
to the whole situation is... personal.

36:57.320 --> 37:02.000
Deeply personal, and that he will reach
for the ultimate solution, armed conflict,

37:02.080 --> 37:04.960
without waiting for
an international coalition to join him.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.040
Today,

37:06.600 --> 37:09.440
a delegation of French government
and intelligence officials

37:09.520 --> 37:12.800
came to Downing Street for secret talks.

37:14.040 --> 37:17.800
Further secret talks are planned
with Israeli officials next week.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.120
[butler 1] So, what have we got today?

37:21.200 --> 37:24.480
[butler 2] Potted shrimp
or deviled crabmeat imperial.

37:24.560 --> 37:27.080
Followed by cassoulets Ã  la jockey club.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.760
Lord Mountbatten, Your Majesty.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.720
Thank you for seeing me.

37:32.800 --> 37:37.360
[Elizabeth] Well, I've got a long-standing
commitment at the theater, I'm afraid.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.800
But I thought we'd have
an early supper before I go.

37:39.880 --> 37:43.200
Mommy's most put out
she hasn't been invited. Hm.

37:44.760 --> 37:49.800
Mm. Under normal circumstances, uh,

37:49.880 --> 37:55.840
a mad rush to war might be explained
as a play for legacy.

37:55.920 --> 37:58.680
-[Elizabeth] Mm-hmm.
-He was in Winston's shadow for so long,

37:58.760 --> 38:03.000
a quick and successful war
might look good on his record.

38:03.400 --> 38:08.880
But in this case, I think it boils down
to an irrational personal dislike.

38:09.880 --> 38:14.120
The two men, he and Nasser,
just hate one another.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.680
And the rest of us
are just getting caught up in it.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.680
What are you suggesting
that I do about it?

38:18.760 --> 38:21.800
You have your weekly private audience
in which the two of you are alone.

38:21.880 --> 38:25.160
Observe him carefully.
Listen to him closely.

38:25.240 --> 38:28.840
Read your cabinet minutes... minutely.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.000
Speak your mind.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.160
Yes, well, I'm not really
supposed to do that.

38:33.240 --> 38:35.880
Even if it's in the interests
of national security?

38:39.080 --> 38:40.360
All right. Fine.

38:42.640 --> 38:43.800
I'll keep an eye on him.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.280
Carefully.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.000
Closely.

38:49.040 --> 38:49.880
Minutely.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.800
-Thank you for supper.
-[chuckles]

38:53.320 --> 38:56.280
You... You will let me know, won't you,

38:56.360 --> 38:58.960
when I can take care of all this
and send you someone really good?

38:59.040 --> 38:59.880
What?

39:00.320 --> 39:02.760
-The food.
-What's wrong with it?

39:02.840 --> 39:06.720
It belongs in a nursery. Everything that
should've been hot was cold.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.440
Everything that should've been
soft was hard.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.080
[sighs] I've neither noticed or cared.

39:11.160 --> 39:14.680
And frankly, Dickie,
the older and grander you get,

39:15.120 --> 39:17.840
the more common you become. [chuckles]

39:18.960 --> 39:20.880
-Have you heard from Philip?
-How's Philip?

39:21.360 --> 39:23.400
No, no, not a word.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.800
-They will be keeping him busy.
-Oh, yes, of course.

39:27.360 --> 39:28.360
[Elizabeth chuckles]

39:29.560 --> 39:32.360
You married a wild spirit.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.440
-[chuckles]
-We both did.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.080
Trying to tame them is no use.

39:39.640 --> 39:43.200
There were times in India,
it was all right under my nose,

39:43.280 --> 39:46.800
with Nehru of all people,
my opposite number.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.920
The humiliation
could not have been more complete.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.880
Of course I considered ending it.

39:54.960 --> 39:59.440
And then I imagined how thin
and how poor life would be.

40:00.480 --> 40:04.760
And I realized that when you really
adore someone...

40:06.200 --> 40:10.800
as fully and as hopelessly
as I think you and I do...

40:12.320 --> 40:13.600
you put up with anything.

40:18.280 --> 40:19.120
[Elizabeth] Hm.

40:22.560 --> 40:23.600
What's the play?

40:24.880 --> 40:28.240
Did I say play? I meant ballet.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.840
-Oh.
-Well, I should say Royal Ballet.

40:31.320 --> 40:34.680
We've just given them a charter,
so I really do have to go.

40:34.760 --> 40:38.680
-It's  Giselle.
-Oh, isn't that Galina Ulanova?

40:39.360 --> 40:41.680
-Yes.
-Lucky you.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.440
They say she's quite the thing.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.000
-Do they?
-That's what they say.

40:45.080 --> 40:45.960
[Elizabeth] Hm.

40:51.160 --> 40:52.880
[sighs]

41:00.200 --> 41:02.880
[Giselle score playing]

42:39.960 --> 42:42.960
[audience applauding]

42:54.200 --> 42:58.680
They're wondering if you'd like now
to meet Miss Ulanova, ma'am.

43:03.560 --> 43:04.560
No, thank you.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.760
I've prepared some tea.
Would Her Majesty like...?

43:41.600 --> 43:44.760
[Eden speaking indistinctly on television]

43:47.440 --> 43:48.680
[Eden on television]  All my life

43:49.320 --> 43:51.000
I've been a man of peace.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.200
Working for peace,

43:53.720 --> 43:56.960
striving for peace,
negotiating for peace.

43:58.600 --> 44:02.760
I could not be other, even if I wished.

44:03.120 --> 44:06.240
And even though we are faced

44:06.320 --> 44:09.360
with an illegal act of plunder

44:09.440 --> 44:13.120
by a dangerous tyrant in the Middle East,

44:13.200 --> 44:17.720
which threatens our livelihood
and that of many nations,

44:17.800 --> 44:22.400
I am determined to find
a peaceful solution.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.320
[footsteps approaching]

45:34.920 --> 45:36.880
-Your Majesty.
-Prime Minister.

45:39.760 --> 45:44.000
-Events are unfolding at great speed.
-Do sit down, Prime Minister.

45:46.480 --> 45:47.320
Ah.

45:47.840 --> 45:50.040
In the early hours of this morning,

45:50.120 --> 45:54.520
the Israeli army launched an attack
into Egyptian territory,

45:54.600 --> 46:00.240
the Sinai Peninsula,
and is rapidly approaching the Suez Canal.

46:00.320 --> 46:04.760
The Egyptian army has mobilized
a retaliatory force

46:05.280 --> 46:07.880
and is about to engage.

46:09.560 --> 46:13.120
Her Majesty's government
has now issued a deadline

46:13.200 --> 46:16.400
to both Israel and Egypt

46:17.040 --> 46:21.760
to halt all acts of war... and to allow

46:21.840 --> 46:25.160
Anglo-French forces into the country
to preserve the peace.

46:25.240 --> 46:30.360
The Israelis have expressed a willingness
to comply if the Egyptians do, but alas...

46:32.480 --> 46:35.600
President Nasser has thus far refused.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.680
When does the deadline expire?

46:39.120 --> 46:40.320
Tomorrow morning, ma'am.

46:42.560 --> 46:45.640
And the next step, in your view, would be?

46:45.720 --> 46:47.400
Military intervention, ma'am.

46:47.480 --> 46:50.200
-War?
-Indeed.

46:51.120 --> 46:53.240
But to keep the peace.

46:55.760 --> 46:57.720
It is the correct thing to do, ma'am.

46:59.120 --> 47:03.640
Nasser is playing roulette
with the stability of the whole world.

47:05.080 --> 47:08.160
Well... Thank you for your explanation.

47:13.960 --> 47:17.360
Before you go,
I do have one or two questions.

47:19.280 --> 47:22.400
When you mentioned that the Israelis
had launched an attack,

47:23.000 --> 47:24.640
you didn't seem surprised.

47:27.040 --> 47:29.040
Why would I seem surprised?

47:29.120 --> 47:33.600
Unless I'm mistaken,
the Israeli position has always been

47:33.680 --> 47:37.920
that they would, under no circumstances,
launch a full-scale attack by themselves

47:38.440 --> 47:40.480
for fear of diplomatic isolation.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.680
And yet they've gone on
to do precisely that,

47:44.080 --> 47:47.800
indicating that either
they changed their mind,

47:48.360 --> 47:52.800
or... there'd been some kind of collusion.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.000
Have we?

47:59.200 --> 48:02.040
Have we... what?

48:05.240 --> 48:06.800
Colluded with Israel?

48:08.000 --> 48:09.080
In any way?

48:29.920 --> 48:31.800
Six days ago...

48:34.400 --> 48:38.480
this government met with representatives

48:38.560 --> 48:43.160
of the French and Israeli governments
in a small village

48:43.840 --> 48:45.720
on the outskirts of Paris,

48:45.800 --> 48:48.640
where a document was signed.

48:51.480 --> 48:52.640
The SÃ¨vres Protocol.

48:54.040 --> 48:59.040
Which outlines plans for
a coordinated offensive against Egypt,

48:59.120 --> 49:03.680
whereby the Israeli army would attack
the Egyptian army near the Suez Canal,

49:03.760 --> 49:07.000
thus allowing the intervention
of Anglo-French forces.

49:14.680 --> 49:16.000
Who else knows about this?

49:16.080 --> 49:18.160
Individual members of Cabinet.

49:19.560 --> 49:21.680
-Senior members.
-But not Parliament?

49:22.280 --> 49:24.120
-No.
-Or the United Nations?

49:27.480 --> 49:28.560
When does all this begin?

49:29.960 --> 49:30.960
[sighs]

49:32.120 --> 49:33.800
Airstrikes begin tomorrow.

49:33.880 --> 49:36.360
-You don't want to give it more time?
-No, ma'am.

49:36.440 --> 49:40.640
The right thing to do
is to go in now, and to go in hard.

49:41.080 --> 49:43.520
I was right about Mussolini.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.920
I was right about Hitler,
and I am right about this fella.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.320
Do I have your support?

50:15.000 --> 50:17.760
The Prime Minister always
has the sovereign's support.

50:24.280 --> 50:25.120
Majesty.

50:28.040 --> 50:29.440
[bell rings]

50:31.000 --> 50:32.240
[door opens]

50:35.600 --> 50:36.480
[door closes]

50:46.960 --> 50:48.040
[rumbling]

50:48.120 --> 50:49.880

50:54.120 --> 50:56.080

50:59.800 --> 51:01.280

51:01.920 --> 51:03.840

51:50.000 --> 51:52.800
-[soldiers speaking indistinctly]

52:37.280 --> 52:39.680
[bell chimes in the distance]

52:54.760 --> 52:56.840
[glass clinks]

53:20.720 --> 53:21.560
Amen.

53:29.240 --> 53:30.240
[sighs]

53:38.120 --> 53:40.840
[writing]
