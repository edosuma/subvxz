WEBVTT

00:47.160 --> 00:48.520
Be careful, Therese!

01:11.320 --> 01:12.480
No sign of Therese?

01:13.360 --> 01:14.840
Late again, I shouldn't wonder.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.360
I'll go. Therese?

01:28.360 --> 01:29.400
Therese?

01:36.760 --> 01:39.720
Therese! Therese! Therese!

02:25.640 --> 02:26.920
Oi! Out!

02:27.760 --> 02:30.760
C'mon, shoo! Out! Out!

02:30.800 --> 02:32.680
Come on, or it'll be roast chicken for dinner

02:32.720 --> 02:34.520
and I won't be gentle with the stuffing!

02:37.400 --> 02:41.000
-Morning. -Did you sleep with

02:37.400 --> 02:41.000
your door open?

02:41.040 --> 02:42.280
It's the only way I can get

02:42.320 --> 02:44.400
a through draft in this godforsaken sweat box.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.560
Eyes on you, sir. Keep walking.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.800
Oh, charming!

02:48.440 --> 02:49.760
You're here early.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.800
There's been a fire at <i>Le Couvent du Sacre-Coeur.</i>

02:51.840 --> 02:54.680
Ah, ah, ah, English please. My house, my rules.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.280
The Convent of the Sacred Heart.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.800
-A postulant nun has died from smoke inhalation.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.480
Cause of the fire?

03:03.440 --> 03:05.360
According to the fire department,

03:05.400 --> 03:07.440
it was started by a cigarette.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.440
The nun was smoking in her cell!

03:13.240 --> 03:16.560
-Nothing. -Typical Caribbean, though.

03:13.240 --> 03:16.560
Even the nuns are laid back.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.880
Don't you think that is odd

03:19.920 --> 03:21.680
Listen, on this island, I wouldn't be surprised

03:21.720 --> 03:24.200
if she was making sangria with the communion wine.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.480
She was a woman of God.

03:26.520 --> 03:30.760
Behind their saintly exterior, nuns have a heart of stone.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.920
Appearances can be deceptive.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.000
Yes, indeed.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.880
NUN: Welcome. Good day.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.240
Are you OK?

03:54.080 --> 03:55.320
Yeah, fine.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.320
Can I help you?

03:57.360 --> 03:58.880
I'm Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.480
This is Detective Inspector Poole.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.080
I'm still in shock. Poor Therese.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.880
-If only I could have got there sooner.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.120
I discovered the fire.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.040
<i>Her door was locked</i> <i>so Father John broke it down.</i>

04:13.080 --> 04:15.360
<i>Through the smoke we could see</i> <i>her lying on her bed,</i>

04:15.400 --> 04:16.520
<i>head on her pillow.</i>

04:16.560 --> 04:18.360
<i>It was just like</i> <i>she was asleep.</i>

04:18.400 --> 04:20.400
JOHN: Let's get her out of here.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.400
Quickly! Oh, Therese!

04:29.200 --> 04:32.520
MARGUERITE:<i> I tried to</i> <i>revive her. But it was no use.</i>

04:36.040 --> 04:37.960
I'm sure you did everything you could.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.320
Father John had better be our first port of call.

04:40.360 --> 04:44.160
Of course. It's hit him quite hard.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.680
Like all of us. We're like a little family here.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.000
I'll show you the way.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.800
I keep saying to myself, "Keep busy, keep busy."

05:00.840 --> 05:03.560
Yes, of course. It must be a shock.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.240
Father, forgive the question

05:07.280 --> 05:10.600
but is it usual for the nuns here to smoke?

05:10.640 --> 05:13.880
You have to understand Therese was a postulant nun,

05:13.920 --> 05:15.640
she'd been here less than six months.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.600
She hadn't taken holy orders yet.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.600
Postulancy being a sort of trial period

05:19.640 --> 05:21.280
before you actually commit yourself?

05:21.320 --> 05:24.080
Exactly, and it's a big transition to make,

05:24.120 --> 05:28.040
giving up nearly all contact with the outside world.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.680
No possessions. No money, but the cigarettes.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.840
We knew it was a struggle for her.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.400
And she always smoked when she was upset.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.520
It seems odd that she didn't wake up when the fire started.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.520
That's another tragedy, she took sleeping pills, you see.

05:43.560 --> 05:47.200
-Found it hard to sleep. -And where did she

05:43.560 --> 05:47.200
get the pills?

05:47.240 --> 05:50.200
Sister Marguerite whom you met outside just now,

05:50.240 --> 05:53.280
she runs the infirmary here. She's a trained nurse.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.440
Did you notice anything suspicious this morning?

05:57.680 --> 05:59.160
Out of the ordinary?

05:59.200 --> 06:03.320
Well, not this morning, but I haven't seen her...

06:03.360 --> 06:05.480
But some of the nuns came to me saying,

06:05.520 --> 06:08.240
they'd seen some sort of phantom nun.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.600
A phantom nun?

06:13.640 --> 06:17.440
A person who is not a sister in the convent, but dressed as one.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.240
Sorry to interrupt. I didn't know you had company.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.000
This is Sister Anne, our Mother Superior.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.560
Father, what a mess!

06:28.640 --> 06:31.160
I'm always clearing up after him!

06:31.200 --> 06:32.720
I just came to see how you were.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.680
She's with our Lord and Saviour now. You know that, Father.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.760
Bury your sadness in his loving heart.

06:44.960 --> 06:49.240
Father John was just telling us about your phantom nun?

06:51.600 --> 06:53.400
Of course not. She doesn't exist.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.400
Father John seems very tired now,

06:57.440 --> 06:59.280
perhaps I could help you instead?

07:06.760 --> 07:10.120
ANNE: I'm not made of stone, I do my grieving in private.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.480
I need to keep myself together.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.520
God is in the detail and the details need my attention,

07:15.560 --> 07:17.120
death or no death.

07:19.560 --> 07:22.360
The convent has water that is said to heal, sir.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.200
They do heal, my dear.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.320
And it's getting quite famous now, isn't it?

07:27.360 --> 07:30.240
Yes. People are coming from all over in the hope of a cure.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.000
-Even Canada. -So people cast

07:30.280 --> 07:33.000
aside medical science

07:33.040 --> 07:34.880
to come and splash themselves with water?

07:34.920 --> 07:37.240
Ah! A cynic.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.640
Call me old fashioned, but I simply

07:38.680 --> 07:40.880
have a healthy respect for scientific proof.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.160
Proof enough for you?

07:42.200 --> 07:45.200
I was diagnosed with cancer in 2010.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.160
I drank of the waters, I bathed in the waters.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.760
By last year I was cancer free and have been ever since.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.560
Living proof, you might say.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.120
Might help that rash of yours.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.280
Father John said you tried to unlock Therese's door.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.680
Yes, I think she must have locked it

08:02.720 --> 08:04.200
because she was smoking in there.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.000
She knew we'd disapprove.

08:06.040 --> 08:09.680
I couldn't get my key in the lock, because hers was inside.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.440
I tried to force my key into the lock...

08:11.480 --> 08:13.040
Right, you go and talk to the other nuns.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.800
Ask them about the discovery of the fire

08:14.840 --> 08:16.400
and this so called phantom nun.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.800
I'll join Fidel in the cell.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.600
You sure you'll be all right on your own?

08:24.480 --> 08:25.600
I'll pray for you.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.200
So what was she like, this Therese?

08:30.240 --> 08:32.040
She was young, only 18.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.600
Brought up in an orphanage, in France.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.760
I'm afraid she picked up some bad habits.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.520
Bad habits!

08:43.360 --> 08:45.480
Nuns

08:47.600 --> 08:49.680
What sort of bad habits?

08:49.720 --> 08:53.360
Alcohol. Chewing gum. Those cigarettes of hers.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.280
I said to her, "They'll kill you one day."

08:57.560 --> 08:59.600
I tried to come down hard on her, but...

09:01.360 --> 09:02.640
I shouldn't say this,

09:02.680 --> 09:05.280
but Father John had a bit of soft spot for her.

09:05.320 --> 09:06.360
In what way?

09:07.880 --> 09:11.040
He allowed her things to facilitate the transition.

09:12.640 --> 09:13.960
I have errands to run.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.600
Can I help you with anything else?

09:16.640 --> 09:18.680
No, no, no, that'll be all, thank you.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.200
Nuns.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.520
They're just creepy, aren't they?

09:24.560 --> 09:26.680
All this for a cigarette.

09:26.720 --> 09:27.840
Or was it?

09:29.120 --> 09:30.960
Therese was found with her head on the pillow,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.160
-Right.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.960
Well, if her head was on her pillow

09:35.000 --> 09:37.040
and she was lying flat on her back,

09:37.080 --> 09:39.440
how come the fire started at this end of the bed?

09:39.480 --> 09:41.600
So what are you saying, sir?

09:41.640 --> 09:44.240
I'm saying that she didn't smoke the cigarette that killed her.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.920
-No one.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.880
Someone planted it to make all this look like an accident.

09:48.920 --> 09:53.280
But who would want to murder a nun?

09:53.320 --> 09:55.920
Anyone who'd seen <i>The Sound Of Music</i>

09:53.320 --> 09:55.920
more than once?

09:55.960 --> 09:58.720
No, sir, it's impossible. She was in here alone.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.880
Look, the window is sealed, right?

10:00.920 --> 10:02.960
And the door was locked, but from the inside.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.480
You see, the key is still in the lock.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.920
No one could have got in to start a fire and back out again.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.640
And what about this?

10:08.680 --> 10:10.160
She had cigarettes in her room.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.960
That just proves she was a smoker, we already knew that.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.280
This mattress is old, pre any kind of fire regulation.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.600
The smoke would've killed her in minutes.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.040
I think the killer knew that.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.280
But how did they get in? And out again.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.480
If you're going to make Sergeant, Fidel,

10:26.520 --> 10:29.560
you're going to have to learn to think outside the box.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.760
Or in this case, think outside the cell.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.120
Oh! For Christ's sake!

10:39.160 --> 10:41.640
Fidel, I want you to conduct a thorough forensic search.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.080
Pay particular attention to the door.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.880
-OK, I'll start by dusting for prints.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.880
-Good.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.360
Dwayne, we'll need exclusion prints

10:46.400 --> 10:48.160
from the sisters and Father John.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.480
-Yes, sir. -Then help Fidel

10:48.200 --> 10:50.480
complete the search in here.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.120
I want every inch covered.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.280
Camille wants you outside.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.080
Says she has something you have to see.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.960
This

11:10.000 --> 11:11.840
The water is said to be miraculous.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.560
-Sir...

11:15.600 --> 11:19.000
Holy Water? There's no such thing as Holy Water. Look, look.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.320
See? No miracle. Still there.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.320
And just to clear this up, this is heat-related psoriasis,

11:28.360 --> 11:29.920
not a stigmata.

11:39.840 --> 11:40.960
NUN: Sister.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.360
Elodie.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.440
Sister Marguerite now.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.600
-I'm fine.

11:56.360 --> 11:59.520
-Well, apart from... -Yes.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.920
It's so terrible. But I'm determined to be strong.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.480
You have to be at times like these.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.360
I learnt that the hard way.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.920
Of course you did.

12:09.960 --> 12:13.640
But enough about me. I suppose you're married now?

12:13.680 --> 12:16.680
-No, still young,

12:13.680 --> 12:16.680
free and single.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.840
Well, free and single at any rate!

12:21.320 --> 12:23.040
Dip your thumb in the ink for me.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.560
There's nothing to worry about.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.040
We just have to eliminate certain prints from the inquiry.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.360
Good to see you again, Elodie.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.400
Suspects?

12:59.240 --> 13:00.960
Any prints?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.880
It's hard to get much, sir.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.160
There are partial prints on Therese,

13:04.200 --> 13:05.680
but nothing else on the lock and key.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.960
How about the cigarette packet we found in the room?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.320
No, there were no prints there at all.

13:09.360 --> 13:12.360
Making it very unlikely they were her cigarettes.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.000
Must have been planted in the room.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.920
I spoke to the sisters at the convent

13:16.960 --> 13:18.720
about the phantom nun, like you said.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.040
And could she walk through walls

13:21.080 --> 13:23.760
No, but some of them said they'd seen a figure

13:23.800 --> 13:26.520
walking about the convent who wasn't one of them.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.840
-OK, what is it with

13:26.560 --> 13:29.840
you and nuns? Hey! Look what I found

13:29.880 --> 13:33.160
when I did the final sweep of Therese's room.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.160
It was hidden behind a loose panel in her cell.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.680
-It's just like<i> The Count Of</i> <i>Monte Cristo.</i>

13:43.720 --> 13:45.800
CAMILLE: A secret hiding place in a prisoner's cell,

13:45.840 --> 13:48.760
only his was behind a loose stone in the fireplace.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.400
-No, no, we tended to

13:50.440 --> 13:52.720
concentrate on the classics at school.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.160
-Dickens, Trolloppe, Eliot... -Yes, it is a classic.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.080
Yeah, in France. Slightly different.

13:58.120 --> 14:02.760
Ah. A one way ticket to France, leaving next week.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.160
Looks like our prisoner was planning to escape.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.560
-A printed list

14:05.200 --> 14:07.560
of names and numbers.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.440
-No.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.880
Dwayne, we need to find the people on here.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.560
-Find out their connection to Therese.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.560
-Look.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.320
Another packet.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.680
But these are a different brand to the ones

14:16.360 --> 14:18.680
we found in her room.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.400
Why would you hide one packet and not the other?

14:20.440 --> 14:23.240
Because, as I thought, the other packet was planted.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.280
Gum! But this is unopened.

14:26.320 --> 14:29.560
Then where did the gum come from that was stuck to my shoe?

14:32.080 --> 14:34.880
She knew gum was frowned upon, why just leave it on the floor?

14:34.920 --> 14:37.000
Maybe she was going to pick it up in the morning.

14:37.040 --> 14:40.560
She couldn't have known someone was going to murder her.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.640
Don't forget she was just a teenage girl, after all.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.000
"If you speak, I will silence you."

14:45.040 --> 14:47.840
"Vengeance is mine, I will repay."

14:49.400 --> 14:51.560
Romans 12, verse 19.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.640
A teenage girl who knew too much?

15:00.480 --> 15:02.520
It's been such a shock for all of us

15:02.560 --> 15:06.000
and I just wondered if you wanted to talk?

15:06.040 --> 15:09.480
When I need to talk, I talk to the Lord.

15:09.520 --> 15:13.240
Which was what I was doing when you knocked, so...

15:13.280 --> 15:15.600
Of course, Reverend Mother. Forgive me.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.800
Anything back on that list of names?

15:18.840 --> 15:21.560
Maybe one of them wanted Therese silenced for some reason.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.560
-Nothing yet, chief.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.160
Remember, Therese often slept late because of sleeping pills

15:26.200 --> 15:27.960
administered by Sister Marguerite.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.760
You think she upped the dose

15:29.800 --> 15:31.160
to ensure she slept through the fire?

15:31.200 --> 15:33.280
No, it was Elodie who tried to save her.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.200
-Sorry. Sister Marguerite.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.360
She changed her name when she took Holy Orders.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.880
The lengths women will go to avoid you, Dwayne.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.080
It wasn't like that.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.920
We used to hang out, fool around, you know.

15:49.840 --> 15:53.920
But her parents died when she was 21. Motor boat accident.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.480
She never got over it.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.880
Then, not long after, she joined the convent.

16:06.320 --> 16:07.600
You think she can be happy?

16:08.320 --> 16:10.680
You mean, without you?

16:10.720 --> 16:13.360
Dwayne, she married Christ. You could never compete,

16:13.400 --> 16:15.840
not with the miracles and the father-in-law.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.840
Ah, but does he have my killer smile?

16:18.880 --> 16:21.920
CAMILLE: OK. Thank you.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.440
OK, thank you.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.720
The plane ticket we found in Therese's box

16:25.760 --> 16:27.040
was paid for in cash

16:27.080 --> 16:28.920
a week ago by a Michael Lannon.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.600
He bought two tickets to Paris-Orly,

16:30.640 --> 16:32.720
one for Therese and one for him.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.760
Right, so they were planning to leave the island together.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.240
Good work, Camille. Right then, who is Michael Lannon?

16:39.280 --> 16:40.800
Check all residents with that name,

16:40.840 --> 16:43.040
all passenger lists in and out of Sainte-Marie.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.120
I want him found.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.200
I've put the word out on Michael Lannon.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.800
If he's on the island, he won't be able to stay hidden for long.

16:59.760 --> 17:03.960
So, come on, what is it with you and nuns?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.480
What?

17:05.520 --> 17:08.520
You've been strange all day, you nearly jumped out of your skin

17:08.560 --> 17:11.080
when Sister Anne entered Father John's office.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.640
She just startled me, that's all.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.080
Look, I don't want to talk about it.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.400
It's something in your childhood, isn't it?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.240
Catholic school? Altar boy...

17:22.280 --> 17:24.320
Look, if you must know,

17:24.360 --> 17:26.920
the House Mother at my boarding school was a nun.

17:26.960 --> 17:31.480
Sister Benedict. Imagine Geoff Capes in a wimple.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.040
-It doesn't matter.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.600
Anyway she used to terrorise us with spot checks, day and night

17:36.760 --> 17:39.600
nails, teeth, underpants...

17:39.640 --> 17:42.240
-I still have

17:39.640 --> 17:42.240
nightmares where I wake up

17:42.280 --> 17:44.400
seeing her mole-ridden face in mine.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.640
-You know she had this slipper, she used to beat us.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.640
-Sir.

17:46.680 --> 17:47.920
I had thighs like corned beef

17:47.960 --> 17:49.720
-for almost my entire childhood. -Sir, I...

17:49.760 --> 17:51.360
I know, they're brides of Christ.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.040
But some are bad through and through. They are evil!

17:54.080 --> 17:55.120
Sir!

17:58.160 --> 18:01.440
Don't worry. I didn't bring my slipper.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.360
Hi. Everything all right?

18:03.400 --> 18:06.400
Yes, there's just something I forgot to tell you

18:06.440 --> 18:07.720
about last night.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.000
Sister Marguerite said Therese was afraid

18:13.040 --> 18:14.600
of something outside this bar.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.800
Yes, it was funny.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.880
What was it she saw?

18:18.920 --> 18:20.360
WOMAN:<i> Not what, but who.</i>

18:21.680 --> 18:24.520
<i>Daryl Dexter. A businessman,</i>

18:24.560 --> 18:27.320
but no one can tell me what sort of business he's in.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.200
Then why would a nun be scared of him

18:31.320 --> 18:32.480
Do you know where he lives?

18:43.440 --> 18:45.840
Er, excuse me. We're looking for Mr. Sexter.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.080
-Dexter. -Dexter.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.240
So nuns and girls in bikini make you nervous.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.880
Or is it just women in general?

18:56.400 --> 18:57.600
Women don't make me nervous.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.520
Good God.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.040
Mr. Dexter?

19:08.080 --> 19:11.840
Detective Inspector Poole. This is Detective

19:08.080 --> 19:11.840
Sergeant Bordey.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.960
Detectives, glad you could make it.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.200
Would you excuse us for a moment?

19:16.240 --> 19:18.120
We're investigating the death of a young woman...

19:18.160 --> 19:21.000
Perhaps we can discuss any business you have in private.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.080
I'd appreciate that. This way.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.360
DEXTER: I'm sure there's some mistake.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.400
Why would anyone be scared of me?

19:34.440 --> 19:37.280
But we have a witness who says she was scared when she saw you.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.640
Very scared.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.520
Then your witness is mistaken.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.800
Did you know Therese, the girl who was killed?

19:43.840 --> 19:46.520
Not personally, no. But I barely go up to the convent.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.880
Just the odd meeting. What kind of meeting?

19:48.920 --> 19:50.840
Sorry, I thought you knew. I run a PR company,

19:50.880 --> 19:52.560
I've just taken them on as clients.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.520
Since when do convents need PR?

19:55.560 --> 19:57.480
Since they discovered they have a Holy Spring.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.600
-It has the potential to transform their fortunes.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.480
The amount of revenue this could generate

20:02.520 --> 20:04.560
for the convent could be quite phenomenal.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.800
-For a price. -A percentage.

20:06.840 --> 20:09.160
That's what this little get together is in aid of.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.960
To stimulate initial interest.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.520
And there's talk about the Holy Spring

20:12.560 --> 20:14.200
being sanctified by the Vatican.

20:14.240 --> 20:18.400
Now, if that happens, the sky's the limit.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.560
Does the name Michael Lannon mean anything to you?

20:21.600 --> 20:24.480
Can't say that it does, no. And do you recognise

20:24.520 --> 20:27.400
any of these names?

20:28.880 --> 20:30.320
We found them in Therese's room.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.720
Take your time. Look, I know you're only

20:36.760 --> 20:39.800
doing your job, but I'm trying to do mine.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.240
And this isn't exactly good for business.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.600
So, if you don't mind.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.800
That man is obsessed with money. And promoting a Holy Spring,

20:51.840 --> 20:56.520
with women in bikinis. I wonder what Sister Anne

20:51.840 --> 20:56.520
would say?

20:56.560 --> 20:58.120
Do not mention bikinis and

20:58.160 --> 21:00.280
Sister Anne in the same sentence!

21:00.320 --> 21:02.120
Conjures up a very powerful image.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.560
I saw a photo of that woman on his desk.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.840
I think I know her from somewhere.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.840
-Drive.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.840
So, Daryl Dexter is suspect number one.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.640
He obviously knew Therese. Why else would she

21:21.880 --> 21:24.640
be scared of him?

21:24.680 --> 21:28.920
Yes, he lied about knowing her. So, what does he have to hide?

21:28.960 --> 21:30.480
Maybe he and Therese were lovers?

21:30.520 --> 21:33.960
Maybe he's the Michael Lannon who bought the plane tickets?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.800
I haven't found anyone of that name on the island yet.

21:36.840 --> 21:39.960
But Daryl has a lover, remember? The woman we saw at the villa.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.360
Doesn't mean he can't have another one.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.080
Yes, but, if they were lovers,

21:43.120 --> 21:45.280
why was she so scared of him during the procession?

21:45.320 --> 21:47.560
Maybe she was going to tell his girlfriend

21:47.600 --> 21:49.200
about their relationship?

21:49.240 --> 21:52.000
So he sent the threatening letter to silence her?

21:52.040 --> 21:54.800
It's rubbish, isn't it. Any joy on that list of names?

21:54.840 --> 21:57.280
Maybe there's a connection to Daryl Dexter there?

21:57.320 --> 21:59.080
Fidel's on the case.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.800
Something else came up here.

22:00.840 --> 22:03.520
I've just spoken to the orphanage in Strasbourg

22:00.840 --> 22:03.520
where Therese grew up.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.320
They say she wasn't a religious girl.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.800
Quite the opposite in fact,

22:06.840 --> 22:08.600
boys, drugs, petty theft.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.720
So, not the obvious candidate to join a convent?

22:11.480 --> 22:13.680
Ah, but that's not all.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.520
When I was looking for their telephone number,

22:15.560 --> 22:17.560
I went onto the orphanage website.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.080
They have a gallery going back years

22:19.120 --> 22:20.800
and had photographs of their celebrations

22:20.840 --> 22:23.440
for the Pope's visit to Strasbourg in 1988.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.760
Therese wasn't born in 1988.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.840
It's not Therese.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.040
Sorry to disturb you, Father.

22:41.840 --> 22:46.920
Ah, part of your PR campaign? I met Daryl Dexter earlier.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.080
I know people doubt his motives,

22:49.120 --> 22:51.680
but with his help, I'm sure we can

22:49.120 --> 22:51.680
save the convent.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.960
Save it?

22:53.000 --> 22:56.640
Well, each year, costs rise, donations dwindle.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.520
You mean your future here is in doubt?

22:58.560 --> 23:02.400
In this house, yes. There's talk of it being sold.

23:02.440 --> 23:05.320
Many old convents are turned into hotels these days.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.560
Of course, the nuns can find homes in other convents.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.440
I'm sure the church can find a home for me somewhere.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.480
Yeah, where were you before here?

23:13.520 --> 23:15.160
Oh, many places.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.280
I was a priest there, many years ago.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.880
Attached to the orphanage where Therese spent her childhood.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.960
But you didn't think to tell us that?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.560
I didn't think it was relevant. It was 20 odd years ago.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.760
I was long gone before she was there.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.320
And also, it was a difficult time.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.720
I don't want to go into it.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.800
Well, I'm sure the diocese in Strasbourg can tell us?

23:42.960 --> 23:48.440
Old sins make long shadows, isn't that what they say?

23:48.480 --> 23:51.920
-Ah. -Ginette Pascal.

23:51.960 --> 23:56.080
For once, I was just a man, not a man of God.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.320
I would have left the priesthood for her,

23:58.360 --> 24:00.080
but the church found out.

24:00.120 --> 24:04.480
They didn't want a scandal and so I was sent away.

24:04.520 --> 24:07.160
Not that it stopped the sisters here finding out.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.040
Oh, the orphanage told one of my officers

24:13.080 --> 24:15.000
that Therese wasn't a religious girl.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.080
So why did she want to become a nun?

24:17.120 --> 24:20.640
She'd spent her whole life inside an institution,

24:20.680 --> 24:24.200
and quite simply didn't know how to exist outside of one.

24:24.240 --> 24:27.120
-Of sorts.

24:27.160 --> 24:30.400
Even to the extent that she hid things in her cell?

24:30.440 --> 24:35.040
We found a box, hidden behind a secret panel.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.720
Like<i> The Count Of Monte Cristo.</i>

24:39.080 --> 24:40.120
Quite.

25:00.800 --> 25:04.120
Ah! Great minds. You thought you'd get an early start too?

25:04.160 --> 25:07.200
Yes. What's that?

25:07.240 --> 25:10.120
Ah, your<i> Count Of Monte Cristo.</i>

25:10.160 --> 25:12.680
Ah! And?

25:12.720 --> 25:14.200
Quite a man.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.400
But, most importantly, it got me to thinking about locked cells

25:17.440 --> 25:20.360
and how you get through solid walls.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.400
Well, Edmund Dantes used a tunnel.

25:22.440 --> 25:25.360
Yes, but we found no tunnel. So, how else could someone

25:25.400 --> 25:28.320
get out of a locked room

25:28.360 --> 25:29.800
after starting the fire?

25:31.080 --> 25:32.560
Anyone from the convent would've known

25:32.600 --> 25:34.200
the place like the back of their hand.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.840
Yes, speaking of which...

25:37.840 --> 25:39.680
Still waiting on that miracle.

25:39.720 --> 25:43.560
Father John. He didn't mention the orphanage connection.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.160
He didn't know her back then.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.560
Yeah, but we know he had an eye for the ladies.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.240
Maybe Therese was his lover.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.680
His motive to kill her?

25:50.720 --> 25:52.440
She threatened to expose the affair?

25:52.480 --> 25:55.200
He couldn't survive a second scandal?

25:55.240 --> 25:58.920
But Daryl Dexter, he's still our main suspect.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.920
He lied about knowing Therese, and she was terrified of him.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.800
Ah, yes, but he didn't have access to the

26:01.960 --> 26:04.800
nuns' living quarters.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.320
How could he have got in to start the fire unnoticed?

26:07.360 --> 26:10.520
-Hmm.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.640
Did you look into Sister Marguerite's family's deaths?

26:12.680 --> 26:15.040
Yes. No suspicious circumstances.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.240
Also, the autopsy report is back.

26:18.280 --> 26:21.320
Sleeping pills were found in Therese's system,

26:21.360 --> 26:24.160
but no more than the prescribed dose.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.840
Sister Marguerite did not drug her.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.600
She's still first on the scene though.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.360
Could she have done something to the lock?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.160
Is there is a way to trip it, do you think?

26:31.200 --> 26:33.080
Or could someone maybe have

26:33.120 --> 26:35.640
turned the key from the outside somehow to lock it?

26:35.680 --> 26:37.640
Breakthrough.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.600
We've spoken to all the people on the list of names

26:37.680 --> 26:40.600
from Sister Therese's room.

26:40.640 --> 26:44.080
-They were all cured by the

26:40.640 --> 26:44.080
waters of the Holy Spring.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.320
I find that hard to believe.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.320
-No, no, they all swear it.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.840
Except one. Bomba Dupuis.

26:49.880 --> 26:51.680
An old drunk, lives by the port.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.280
And after a few rum punches

26:53.320 --> 26:55.000
courtesy of the Sainte-Marie Police Force...

26:55.040 --> 26:57.800
Wait, wait, you saying you got a potential witness drunk?

26:57.840 --> 27:02.040
He said he was paid to say he was cured. $200.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.560
So Therese was paying people to endorse the Holy Spring.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.640
No. Not Therese. Daryl Dexter.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.320
Thank you for seeing us.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.840
No problem. Can I get you a drink

27:14.880 --> 27:16.080
No, thank you.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.320
Oh. Well, you don't mind if I do?

27:18.360 --> 27:22.160
-Not at all. -It was really Daryl

27:18.360 --> 27:22.160
we wanted to see.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.280
Oh, well, he's off on business, I'm afraid.

27:24.320 --> 27:27.040
What's the nature of your relationship with Mr. Dexter?

27:28.160 --> 27:30.120
We're engaged!

27:32.600 --> 27:34.760
It means congratulations.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.760
I've been grinning like a school girl ever since he asked me.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.880
It's ridiculous at my age, I know.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.280
How involved are you in his business dealings?

27:43.240 --> 27:44.880
Oh, very.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.960
We're a partnership.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.920
I'm very excited about the Holy Spring.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.880
You see, the pool might be in the convent,

27:52.920 --> 27:56.120
but I own the land where the spring finds its source.

27:56.160 --> 28:00.640
-Yes, it was left to me

27:56.160 --> 28:00.640
many years ago.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.560
Well, we thought it was worthless

28:02.600 --> 28:05.000
but then a nun gets cured,

28:05.040 --> 28:06.640
and then others.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.760
I'm hoping to sell it to the Vatican,

28:08.800 --> 28:10.880
once the waters have been sanctified.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.520
At a great profit, I presume?

28:12.560 --> 28:16.640
Well, certainly enough to keep me in imported champagne.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.920
You are aware that a nun was found at the convent,

28:21.960 --> 28:23.760
dead in her room?

28:23.800 --> 28:27.640
I know. Isn't it dreadful?

28:27.680 --> 28:29.800
Were you also aware that the same nun had discovered

28:29.840 --> 28:33.600
that Daryl had been bribing people to make bogus claims

28:33.640 --> 28:35.440
about being cured by the spring?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.600
Well, I really can't imagine that that's true.

28:39.520 --> 28:40.880
CAMILLE: Do you mind if I join you?

28:40.920 --> 28:42.960
I've been trying to give up but...

28:43.000 --> 28:44.160
Yes, of course.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.880
-I really should be good. -Look, can we get back

28:47.520 --> 28:49.880
to the bribes?

28:49.920 --> 28:53.360
Bribes? Are you implying

28:53.400 --> 28:56.960
that Daryl and I are somehow involved in...

28:53.400 --> 28:56.960
That's just ridiculous.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.520
I know exactly when the fire broke out in the convent

28:59.560 --> 29:02.520
and I can tell you, Daryl and I were together that morning.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.000
So if you'd just like to let yourself out...

29:09.920 --> 29:11.400
Since when do you smoke?

29:11.440 --> 29:14.160
Since I wanted to see whether Laura smokes the same cigarettes

29:14.200 --> 29:15.920
we found in Therese's room.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.240
And she does.

29:21.240 --> 29:22.320
Come on.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.360
Come on. Haven't got all day.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.200
I'll come back later.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.280
Can you think of any reason why anyone would want to attack you?

30:36.080 --> 30:38.120
Some of the silverware on the altar

30:38.160 --> 30:40.360
might be worth stealing, I suppose.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.600
But nothing was stolen.

30:42.800 --> 30:47.960
We found these. Grown here. Rosary beads.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.720
Not the conventional weapon we encounter,

30:49.760 --> 30:52.880
which rather suggests it was someone from the convent.

30:54.040 --> 30:55.680
Can't believe what you're insinuating.

30:57.080 --> 31:00.040
Sister Anne, if you don't help us,

31:00.080 --> 31:02.040
the attacker may strike again.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.000
Therese is dead. One of the other sisters

31:04.040 --> 31:07.040
may be in danger or you may not be

31:04.040 --> 31:07.040
so lucky next time.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.840
I've survived cancer and I have survived this.

31:09.880 --> 31:12.080
And mark my words, it has nothing to do with luck.

31:13.560 --> 31:17.280
God has saved me twice. He obviously has some

31:13.560 --> 31:17.280
plan for me.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.960
I brought you some tea. I was just...

31:21.000 --> 31:22.280
I couldn't drink it.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.600
Well, if it's going spare...

31:34.680 --> 31:36.080
Why won't she talk?

31:36.120 --> 31:38.560
I don't know. But I know why she didn't drink the tea.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.000
I think they make it with your Holy Water. Thank you.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.560
Hey, isn't that Dexter's car?

31:51.400 --> 31:52.760
POOLE: Mr. Dexter!

31:52.800 --> 31:55.640
Inspector. Sergeant Bordey.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.200
This really isn't the best time to talk. And, to be honest,

31:58.240 --> 31:59.640
I've told you everything I know.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.360
Not quite everything.

32:01.400 --> 32:02.920
You failed to mention that you've been bribing

32:02.960 --> 32:05.760
people to say they've been cured.

32:05.800 --> 32:09.680
I have no need to bribe anyone. These waters cure people.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.120
That's not what our witness says.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.880
Well, your witness is wrong.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.360
I don't think so.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.120
I think Therese knew what you were doing

32:16.160 --> 32:19.000
-so you sent her a threatening letter.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.360
I barely knew the girl,

32:20.400 --> 32:23.760
so why would I sent her a Bible spouting letter?

32:23.800 --> 32:25.720
How do you know the letter quoted the Bible?

32:26.760 --> 32:28.400
He said so.

32:28.440 --> 32:29.720
No, he didn't.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.920
Therese had less commitments than the other nuns.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.680
She had time on her hands.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.400
One day...

32:41.200 --> 32:43.880
One day, she saw me giving money to one of the pilgrims.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.600
Next thing I know, a list of contacts

32:46.640 --> 32:48.360
has gone missing from my car.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.840
The list we found in her cell.

32:51.160 --> 32:53.160
She came to me and said she knew what I was doing

32:53.200 --> 32:54.640
and was going to tell Father John

32:54.680 --> 32:57.720
if I didn't stop the bribes. I panicked.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.400
So you killed her?

32:59.440 --> 33:02.920
No. I threatened her.

33:02.960 --> 33:05.360
I just threatened her.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.200
I admit maybe I was over the top with the Bible bit,

33:08.240 --> 33:10.560
but I thought it was a language she'd understand.

33:10.600 --> 33:14.560
But I did not kill her. That's ridiculous.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.680
Anyway, I was with Laura at the time of the fire.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.800
So she was keen to point out.

33:18.840 --> 33:21.000
Have you been here at the convent all morning?

33:21.720 --> 33:24.720
Most of it. Why?

33:24.760 --> 33:26.680
So you were here when Sister Anne was attacked?

33:27.920 --> 33:29.080
Attacked?

33:30.120 --> 33:32.200
-She's fine.

33:32.240 --> 33:34.520
Despite someone trying to strangle her.

33:34.560 --> 33:38.360
Did she know your secret

33:38.400 --> 33:42.120
Sister Anne? She's the poster girl for the Holy Spring.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.920
She, at least, has been cured. Why would I want her dead?

33:48.080 --> 33:51.640
So, Therese's discovery of bribes must be what she was

33:51.680 --> 33:54.040
going to tell Father John about before she died.

33:54.080 --> 33:57.280
Only someone made sure she didn't get the chance.

33:57.320 --> 34:00.120
Have we got anything back from the UK on Laura or Daryl yet?

34:00.160 --> 34:01.440
FIDEL: Nothing yet, sir.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.360
But I finished asking for prints on the rosary beads

34:04.400 --> 34:05.760
we found in the chapel.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.560
So

34:07.600 --> 34:10.480
Yes, only partial ones. Sister Marguerite's.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.480
Need a hand? I've been at this for hours.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.760
I'm really sorry to have to ask,

34:25.800 --> 34:29.480
but we found your prints on the rosary.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.240
That's because they're my beads, Dwayne.

34:32.520 --> 34:35.120
But why were they in the chapel?

34:35.160 --> 34:38.280
I must have left them there when I ran out of confession.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.200
You ran out of confession?

34:40.240 --> 34:42.360
I wanted to confess what I'd been thinking about.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.720
Which is?

34:47.320 --> 34:48.360
You.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.240
So I've still got it, then?

34:53.280 --> 34:54.880
Still got a massive ego.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.920
No, no, what I mean is I've been thinking about what

35:00.960 --> 35:03.440
life would have been like if I'd not come here.

35:03.480 --> 35:06.880
I thought I should confess, but when it came to it

35:06.920 --> 35:10.080
I thought Father John had a lot to deal with at the moment.

35:10.120 --> 35:13.080
You've got nothing to confess as far as I can see.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.120
Maybe not.

35:15.160 --> 35:19.120
But when God took my parents, I wanted a family so badly,

35:19.160 --> 35:21.560
and maybe I came here for the wrong reasons.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.520
You happy here, Elodie?

35:30.600 --> 35:31.640
Completely.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.080
Except when my bike gets a puncture.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.400
That's her. The phantom nun.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.360
Hey!

35:50.680 --> 35:53.000
Police!

35:54.880 --> 35:56.640
Ouch! Stop!

36:02.560 --> 36:05.480
Sir, you need to see this.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.040
Mr. Dexter.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.560
Darling, are you all right? You have no right

36:09.080 --> 36:11.560
bringing her here.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.520
And what's the charge, hmm? Come on, darling, we're going.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.880
Just a couple of questions before you go, Sheila.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.240
Just got this from CID in England.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.320
We had them run background checks on both of you.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.360
Sweetheart

36:24.400 --> 36:26.560
They know Laura as Sheila Parker,

36:26.600 --> 36:29.920
a Sussex-based nurse accused of killing her elderly patient.

36:29.960 --> 36:32.840
What was it the press dubbed you

36:32.880 --> 36:36.040
It's not how it sounds. He was in pain.

36:36.080 --> 36:38.280
You left him the wherewithal to administer a lethal injection,

36:38.320 --> 36:40.800
promptly benefited from his will.

36:40.840 --> 36:43.440
Well, I was never convicted. It never even went to trial.

36:43.480 --> 36:44.680
Leaving a lot of unanswered questions

36:44.720 --> 36:46.840
and you are a very rich woman.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.960
You even inherited the land you now own on Sainte-Marie.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.240
Is this true?

36:53.280 --> 36:55.200
I'm not a murderer.

36:55.240 --> 36:56.640
This was all a long time ago.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.920
It has absolutely nothing to do with what's going on now.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.320
Tell us, what is going on now?

37:00.360 --> 37:01.520
What were you doing at the convent?

37:04.200 --> 37:07.640
-I can't say. -Were you at the convent

37:04.200 --> 37:07.640
the morning of the fire?

37:08.480 --> 37:10.040
You know I wasn't.

37:11.680 --> 37:14.000
-Tell them, Daryl. -I'm not lying for you now.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.440
We weren't together that night.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.960
I was on the other side of the island on business.

37:21.600 --> 37:25.040
So neither of you has an alibi for that morning, then.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.560
What for?

37:27.600 --> 37:30.040
We can detain you for questioning

37:27.600 --> 37:30.040
on suspicion of murder.

37:34.840 --> 37:38.320
So, why would Laura Masters make regular visits to the convent?

37:40.040 --> 37:42.720
She was spotted there numerous times before the murder.

37:44.240 --> 37:46.480
To plan how she intended to kill Therese.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.480
Then why was she there today?

37:50.520 --> 37:53.520
-To finish the job on Sister Anne.

37:50.520 --> 37:53.520
-I managed to find it, sir.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.400
What's inside?

37:55.440 --> 37:58.600
Looks like medical stuff.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.360
Medical supplies?

38:00.400 --> 38:02.320
Do you think she was going to kill again?

38:02.360 --> 38:06.240
No, I think this time she was planning to save a life.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.960
I'm sorry I was so short with you before.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.720
It's understandable, given what you've been through.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.600
How are you feeling? My neck is still a little sore.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.720
No, I'm sorry, the cancer.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.440
Cancer? That's gone, you know that.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.120
Has it?

38:28.840 --> 38:31.480
Sister Anne, would you remove your wimple and veil for me?

38:33.720 --> 38:35.720
Inspector, that is not permitted

38:35.760 --> 38:38.040
by the dictates of my convent or my faith.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.600
Or is it because it would betray your secret?

38:40.640 --> 38:41.880
You don't have any hair, do you?

38:43.320 --> 38:45.520
From the chemotherapy you're receiving for the cancer

38:45.560 --> 38:46.920
you're still suffering from.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.880
Laura Masters has just admitted to me that she comes to

38:52.920 --> 38:55.920
the convent periodically to administer further treatment,

38:55.960 --> 38:59.320
dressed as a nun to avoid suspicion.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.760
What must you think of me?

39:04.760 --> 39:07.080
It didn't start as a lie, really.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.120
When I was first diagnosed with cancer,

39:10.160 --> 39:13.920
I started to drink of the Holy Spring.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.800
When I returned to the hospital, they told me that

39:13.960 --> 39:16.800
the tumour had shrunk.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.400
I was overjoyed.

39:18.440 --> 39:22.200
I knew that God had a purpose for me, to save the convent.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.680
People would believe now, truly believe.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.680
The Holy Spring would be our salvation.

39:27.720 --> 39:30.960
But after three months, I went back to the hospital

39:31.000 --> 39:33.160
just for a routine check up and the doctors told me

39:33.200 --> 39:34.760
that the tumour had returned.

39:34.800 --> 39:38.720
I couldn't believe it. But Daryl said we

39:34.800 --> 39:38.720
needn't back out.

39:38.760 --> 39:41.640
He told me about Laura Masters being a cancer nurse,

39:41.680 --> 39:45.240
and that she would help me. I didn't want to lie.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.040
But I felt it was what God wanted.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.720
People were coming to the convent in such numbers

39:49.760 --> 39:52.000
and God's word was spreading.

39:52.040 --> 39:54.400
I felt that the ends would justify the means.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.640
Then Therese found out about your little fraud,

39:56.680 --> 39:58.880
No!

39:58.920 --> 40:00.800
You had the opportunity to come into her room

40:04.040 --> 40:06.000
What about me? Somebody tried to kill me!

40:06.040 --> 40:07.360
How do you account for that?

40:08.400 --> 40:10.320
I know I lied, Lord forgive me, but,

40:11.760 --> 40:13.640
do I look like a murderer to you?

40:21.160 --> 40:23.400
POOLE: You know, I really thought we had our killer.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.040
I was sure Sister Anne killed Therese

40:25.080 --> 40:27.520
to protect the fake spring from being revealed.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.640
I thought when I confronted her she'd confess,

40:29.680 --> 40:32.400
tell me how she did it, say three Hail Marys, case closed.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.440
How did someone get in and out of that room?

40:41.800 --> 40:43.320
-I'm sorry. -That's OK.

40:47.600 --> 40:51.560
You know, sir, that cancer business was brilliant.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.960
Really. How did you work it out?

40:55.000 --> 40:56.320
Well, remember, Fidel,

40:56.360 --> 40:58.560
things aren't always as they appear on the surface.

40:58.600 --> 41:01.240
Especially when disguised by a veil and a wimple.

41:04.120 --> 41:08.960
Or... Or made to look like something else.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.960
Excuse me.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.520
Soot. On the inside of this lock.

41:32.560 --> 41:33.800
I think I know why.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.240
Michael Lannon.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.520
You're right, this wasn't in the fire.

41:47.560 --> 41:50.200
-So, someone put it in afterwards.

41:47.560 --> 41:50.200
-Exactly.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.320
-No.

41:58.360 --> 41:59.800
You think you can do any better?

42:00.960 --> 42:02.080
I may have a way.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.680
Uh, Dwayne, are you sure that...

42:11.720 --> 42:13.040
And we are in.

42:17.240 --> 42:18.840
You found what you're looking for?

42:18.880 --> 42:20.720
I've found exactly what I'm looking for.

42:20.760 --> 42:22.760
And I've found Michael Lannon.

42:28.440 --> 42:29.880
Sorry for the disturbance.

42:31.960 --> 42:36.360
But I'm sure you are all anxious to know who killed Therese.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.080
Almost from the start, it seemed clear that

42:38.120 --> 42:40.800
this case was about the Holy Spring,

42:40.840 --> 42:42.960
and the fact that Therese knew it was a fraud.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.040
-Yes.

42:45.080 --> 42:47.840
I'm sorry to say that any cures you might have heard about

42:47.880 --> 42:49.320
are all false.

42:49.360 --> 42:54.480
And so much rested on that staying a secret for so many.

42:54.520 --> 42:56.360
But like everything in this case,

42:56.400 --> 42:58.840
nothing was as it seemed upon first appearance.

42:58.880 --> 43:03.000
You see, this case isn't about the Holy Spring at all.

43:03.040 --> 43:06.800
And I realised that with the help of the good book,

43:08.560 --> 43:13.360
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo,</i> where nothing is as it seems.

43:13.400 --> 43:17.880
The mad priest isn't really mad, and, well, the count is no count

43:17.920 --> 43:19.840
but one Edmond Dantes,

43:19.880 --> 43:23.080
just as Laura Masters is really Sheila Parker,

43:23.120 --> 43:26.280
Sister Marguerite is really Elodie Francois,

43:26.320 --> 43:28.360
and Father John is in fact Michael Lannon.

43:30.120 --> 43:32.160
You told me everyone has a weakness and yours was a woman,

43:32.200 --> 43:35.480
Ginette Pascal, in Strasbourg. So you were sent away,

43:35.520 --> 43:38.800
far from temptation,

43:38.840 --> 43:42.200
and the woman you loved, to here, Sainte-Marie.

43:42.240 --> 43:45.240
Then Therese arrived, and the two of you began a relationship.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.880
You soon decided to leave together,

43:46.920 --> 43:51.120
so you bought two plane tickets to France.

43:51.160 --> 43:53.120
As you were going to leave the priesthood,

43:53.160 --> 43:56.720
you booked them under the name you had before

43:53.160 --> 43:56.720
you took Holy Orders.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.200
Michael Lannon.

43:58.240 --> 44:01.520
We found out your birth name from the diocese in Strasbourg.

44:01.560 --> 44:03.720
But someone discovered your plan to leave,

44:03.760 --> 44:07.400
someone who couldn't let you make the same mistake again.

44:07.440 --> 44:11.080
Someone who felt they had to stop you

44:07.440 --> 44:11.080
making a fool of yourself,

44:11.120 --> 44:13.800
throwing everything away for a woman.

44:13.840 --> 44:15.480
And that's what you did, isn't it, Sister Anne?

44:15.520 --> 44:17.120
That's why you killed Therese.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.880
Because you feared they were lovers.

44:19.920 --> 44:23.600
Father John, Mother Superior.

44:23.640 --> 44:25.080
You're almost like an old married couple.

44:25.120 --> 44:28.800
You clean up after him, you nag him...

44:28.840 --> 44:31.440
Indeed, in your own way, you love him.

44:31.480 --> 44:33.320
You knew the mistake he'd made in Strasbourg

44:33.360 --> 44:34.800
and you couldn't let his weakness

44:34.840 --> 44:36.840
destroy the relationship you had.

44:36.880 --> 44:39.480
You also knew that the scandal would destroy the convent.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.160
So you had to get rid of Therese.

44:43.520 --> 44:45.720
But how to make her death look accidental?

44:46.800 --> 44:49.400
God really is in the details.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.320
That is what you always say, isn't it, Reverend Mother?

44:51.360 --> 44:54.120
<i>Therese took sleeping pills,</i>

44:54.160 --> 44:55.560
<i>often making her</i> <i>late for chapel,</i>

44:55.600 --> 44:57.960
<i>and she was also a smoker,</i>

44:58.000 --> 45:02.480
<i>giving you the perfect means to</i> <i>make her death look accidental.</i>

45:02.520 --> 45:03.920
Therese kept her cigarettes well hidden,

45:03.960 --> 45:05.800
but I'm sure it was easy enough to steal a packet

45:05.840 --> 45:08.720
of Laura Masters' cigarettes from her bag

45:08.760 --> 45:10.240
<i>during one of her visits</i> <i>to the convent.</i>

45:12.280 --> 45:14.240
You couldn't risk Therese waking up

45:14.280 --> 45:16.640
<i>and smelling the smoke by</i> <i>placing the cigarettes</i>

45:14.280 --> 45:16.640
<i>too close</i> to her face,

45:16.680 --> 45:19.360
<i>so you placed it</i> <i>at the foot of the bed,</i>

45:19.400 --> 45:22.680
<i>assuming that any evidence</i> <i>would be destroyed in the fire.</i>

45:22.720 --> 45:24.240
<i>As the cigarette slowly</i> <i>burned down,</i>

45:24.280 --> 45:26.560
<i>it gave you just enough time to</i> <i>lock the door from the outside.</i>

45:29.000 --> 45:33.360
You then took some gum, which you placed in the lock.

45:33.400 --> 45:37.680
<i>So, to the casual observer,</i> <i>it would look like</i>

45:33.400 --> 45:37.680
<i>the key was still in it.</i>

45:37.720 --> 45:41.840
As the fire took hold, you only pretended to try

45:37.720 --> 45:41.840
and unlock the door.

45:43.560 --> 45:45.320
CAMILLE:<i> As the door was</i> <i>broken down,</i>

45:45.360 --> 45:48.040
you knew all attention would be on Therese.

45:49.320 --> 45:51.920
<i>As everyone rushed to save her,</i>

45:51.960 --> 45:55.880
<i>you put the key in the lock,</i> <i>dislodging the gum inside.</i>

45:55.920 --> 45:59.680
But a tiny piece of the silver paper remained inside,

45:59.720 --> 46:01.080
betraying your method.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.960
As did the gum,

46:03.000 --> 46:05.760
stuck to my shoe, which, with DNA testing,

46:05.800 --> 46:07.200
will prove you're the killer.

46:07.240 --> 46:10.160
No! Someone tried to kill her, too.

46:10.200 --> 46:12.080
Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up.

46:12.120 --> 46:14.440
Because it was that very attack that led us to identify

46:14.480 --> 46:17.240
Sister Anne as the killer. The attack took place here,

46:17.920 --> 46:19.960
just after confession.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.200
Of course, I can't know what was said,

46:22.240 --> 46:24.840
but I can guess by what happened soon afterwards.

46:26.160 --> 46:28.800
Father, I cannot tell you the nature of my sin.

46:30.360 --> 46:33.240
Only know I did it to protect you.

46:33.280 --> 46:35.840
<i>To stop you making</i> <i>the same mistake again.</i>

46:46.600 --> 46:48.240
Father John couldn't go to the police

46:48.280 --> 46:51.440
because he was bound by the confidentiality

46:48.280 --> 46:51.440
of the confessional.

46:51.480 --> 46:52.680
Sister Anne must have known

46:52.720 --> 46:54.800
who attacked her but could say nothing,

46:54.840 --> 46:57.680
as it would expose her as a murderer.

46:57.720 --> 46:59.120
Both bound by silence.

47:06.840 --> 47:09.840
I can't lie any more, child. Not here.

47:10.800 --> 47:14.640
Not before God. It's true.

47:16.920 --> 47:19.360
I had to save Father John from himself.

47:23.800 --> 47:26.160
That pretty little thing had turned his head.

47:26.200 --> 47:27.800
You all saw that, didn't you?

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
If he'd left with her as he planned to,

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
I would have been left alone.

47:35.920 --> 47:38.760
God gave me strength while you were at your weakest.

47:38.800 --> 47:40.280
But I loved her.

47:40.320 --> 47:45.160
No, not love. Lust. That's all it was.

47:40.320 --> 47:45.160
Just as before.

47:47.120 --> 47:50.600
The only real love is here, the family.

47:50.640 --> 47:52.640
She was family.

47:52.680 --> 47:58.440
-She was a devil! -No, Sister, she

47:52.680 --> 47:58.440
really was family.

47:58.480 --> 48:02.120
-Therese, who called Father John

47:58.480 --> 48:02.120
Father every day,

48:02.160 --> 48:04.520
was being deceptively literal.

48:04.560 --> 48:05.920
Wasn't she, Father John? She was my daughter.

48:10.440 --> 48:11.720
Your daughter?

48:11.760 --> 48:13.120
POOLE: The daughter from his relationship

48:13.160 --> 48:15.800
with Ginette Pascal back in Strasbourg

48:15.840 --> 48:17.160
When Therese turned 18,

48:17.200 --> 48:20.160
she was able to find out who her real parents were.

48:20.200 --> 48:21.960
Mother, Ginette Pascal.

48:22.840 --> 48:24.720
Father, Michael Lannon.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.240
Ginette died in childbirth.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.600
I couldn't claim the baby as my own,

48:30.640 --> 48:35.480
so I made sure to place her in the orphanage where I worked.

48:35.520 --> 48:38.280
But I was sent away, far from my own flesh and blood.

48:43.440 --> 48:44.680
That's why she came here.

48:47.320 --> 48:50.160
So she could get to know me.

48:50.200 --> 48:55.000
Then, one day, she told me the truth. Who she was.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.400
I was overjoyed.

48:59.600 --> 49:03.200
Now she's gone. Forever.

49:04.600 --> 49:06.200
Why didn't you tell me?

49:07.920 --> 49:11.680
For the same reason you didn't tell me about the fake spring.

49:11.720 --> 49:13.560
To save the convent.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.280
I would have welcomed her if I'd known!

49:16.320 --> 49:19.320
-I would've done

49:16.320 --> 49:19.320
anything for you.

49:20.600 --> 49:23.280
Oh, please, forgive me.

49:24.840 --> 49:27.360
Please. Please.

49:27.400 --> 49:30.560
Only God can truly forgive.

49:45.480 --> 49:49.000
She lied, manipulated and ultimately killed

49:45.480 --> 49:49.000
to get what she wanted.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.120
Don't be fooled by the little old nun act.

49:51.160 --> 49:53.320
-Nothing is really what it appears.

49:51.160 --> 49:53.320
-Exactly.

49:55.360 --> 49:58.360
CAMILLE: Well, are we going to arrest them for fraud?

49:58.400 --> 50:01.320
POOLE: Unfortunately not. We don't have enough evidence.

50:03.280 --> 50:05.120
Now I suppose you want me to hold up my left hand

50:05.160 --> 50:08.160
-and show you that my psoriasis has been miraculously cured.

50:10.480 --> 50:11.720
No, it's that one.

50:13.440 --> 50:17.320
Honestly, Camille, sometimes your faith

50:13.440 --> 50:17.320
in the unscientific astounds me.

50:22.120 --> 50:25.680
So, I'm guessing this case has done nothing to ease

50:22.120 --> 50:25.680
your nun phobia.

50:25.720 --> 50:28.120
If I never see another nun again, it'll be too soon.

50:32.600 --> 50:35.680
Relax. I'm not here to check your underpants.

50:37.920 --> 50:39.480
Have you two been talking?

50:39.520 --> 50:41.160
I have, actually.

50:41.200 --> 50:44.080
I thought Sister Marguerite could help you

50:41.200 --> 50:44.080
with your problem.

50:44.120 --> 50:46.320
Cortical steroids, for your psoriasis.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.480
-Mmm-hmm.

50:49.520 --> 50:52.920
Science, you see. Not divine intervention.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.680
-No offence. -None taken.

50:57.280 --> 51:00.320
-DWAYNE: I'll drive you back to the convent.

50:57.280 --> 51:00.320
-OK.

51:00.360 --> 51:01.880
And I'll go and get us some more drinks.

51:03.960 --> 51:05.600
Nothing for me.

51:05.640 --> 51:07.160
I'm going to head up as well, actually.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.960
FIDEL: OK. Good night, sir.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.480
Yes, because you've got to get back

51:10.520 --> 51:13.360
to your monastic existence, your cell?

51:13.400 --> 51:15.400
No, I have a book to finish.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.160
I want to find out if the Count of Monte Cristo

51:17.200 --> 51:19.480
ever gets off that bloody island.

51:19.520 --> 51:21.360
Might provide me with a bit of hope.

51:21.400 --> 51:22.880
Well, I can tell you he does.

51:22.920 --> 51:24.600
Ah, fantastic!

51:24.640 --> 51:26.800
Yeah, but it takes him 40 years.

51:29.200 --> 51:31.440
Fidel, I think I might need that drink after all.
