WEBVTT

00:06.374 --> 00:09.275
Wow! I have not seen
so much vomit since frosh week.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.310
Stick with this job,
you'll see plenty more

00:11.378 --> 00:13.812
where that came from.
So...

00:13.880 --> 00:16.648
I think that maybe
you and I need a drink?

00:16.716 --> 00:20.553
- Yeah, ok. Are you buying?
- I'm buying, yeah.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.521
Careful, Elyse.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.422
Slippery slope with this guy.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.458
She offered!
That was an offer, right?

00:26.525 --> 00:29.160
I'm gonna get changed. I'll let
you know where we're gonna go.

00:29.228 --> 00:31.629
Yeah, ok.

00:31.697 --> 00:35.666
- What was that?
- What?

00:35.734 --> 00:39.070
- This look.
- I was just looking at her.

00:39.138 --> 00:41.305
Right, uh-huh.

00:41.372 --> 00:43.673
Maybe my love life has been
stagnating a little lately.

00:43.741 --> 00:46.977
It's time I bought a clue.
So what does that mean?

00:47.044 --> 00:49.913
It means that, uh...
Your man oz here

00:49.981 --> 00:52.216
might just be putting himself
back on the market.

00:52.283 --> 00:54.218
- Huh.
- Yeah.

00:54.285 --> 00:57.520
Ok. Leaf game tonight
at Freddy's?

00:57.588 --> 00:59.955
- Playing the penguins?
- In a few days. Bruins tonight.

01:00.023 --> 01:01.991
- Argh, bruins...
- What?

01:02.058 --> 01:03.959
I'll be crying into my beard
by the second period.

01:04.027 --> 01:05.995
No crying!
We own them tonight,

01:06.062 --> 01:08.697
- yeah, all right!
- Oz!

01:08.765 --> 01:13.301
Hey! Ah, I just got back,
but I wanted to surprise you

01:13.369 --> 01:15.771
before I started my shift. I...
I have so much to tell you.

01:15.839 --> 01:17.773
Can I...
I'll call you later? Yeah?

01:17.841 --> 01:19.775
Hey, Toby.
Hey...

01:19.843 --> 01:21.543
Sandy. Timing
is everything, right?

01:21.611 --> 01:25.681
Not a word.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:43.999 --> 01:45.899
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:45.967 --> 01:48.168
Directors,

01:48.235 --> 01:51.738
management team and guests...

01:51.806 --> 01:54.641
I'd like to take this moment
to announce that this has been

01:54.709 --> 01:58.545
Cooper-Weiss pharmaceuticals'
most profitable year ever!

01:58.612 --> 02:02.181
So let's all raise
a slender glass of bubbly.

02:02.248 --> 02:05.651
And I'd like
to make this toast to you,

02:05.719 --> 02:08.988
to the people without whom none
of this would have been possible.

02:09.056 --> 02:11.256
Cheers! To all of you.

02:11.324 --> 02:13.292
And while we're at it,

02:13.359 --> 02:15.761
let's toast
to seven-year-old Amy kalb...

02:15.829 --> 02:18.462
who liked running
and playing softball

02:18.530 --> 02:20.031
and drawing pictures of horses...
Sir, this is a private event.

02:20.099 --> 02:22.300
And who now lies
in mount pleasant cemetery

02:22.367 --> 02:25.536
after being prescribed
copper-weiss' jannex.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.371
You are out of line,
sir. All right,

02:27.439 --> 02:31.409
can somebody please call secu...

02:34.813 --> 02:38.315
Jeffrey?

02:38.382 --> 02:41.284
Call 911!

02:45.289 --> 02:47.991
We need an ambulance.

02:49.101 --> 02:54.294
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.Addic7ed.Com</font>

02:58.235 --> 03:00.794
He can't be dead.

03:00.821 --> 03:02.722
Please tell me he's not dead.

03:02.790 --> 03:06.092
I know how
you must feel, Ms...

03:06.160 --> 03:07.258
Christa Merker.

03:07.286 --> 03:08.986
I'm V.P. Of production
at Cooper-Weiss.

03:09.054 --> 03:12.490
We'll do everything
we can to catch who did this.

03:15.726 --> 03:17.527
I have to go check out
this other victim.

03:17.595 --> 03:19.362
Yeah. So what's the story?

03:19.430 --> 03:21.231
Poisoning.
As far as we can tell,

03:21.299 --> 03:24.234
it's a prank gone wrong.
There have been six victims,

03:24.302 --> 03:28.037
but so far only
one fatality, a big one:

03:28.106 --> 03:30.772
Jeffrey Brandt, ceo
of Cooper-Weiss pharmaceuticals.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.808
Could it be accidental?

03:32.875 --> 03:34.810
I've ordered a tox screening
on the whole buffet,

03:34.877 --> 03:37.179
it's a shame too, because the
shrimp cocktail looks delicious,

03:37.247 --> 03:39.014
but as far as we can tell,

03:39.082 --> 03:40.816
it's a focused attack on
the members of the head table.

03:40.883 --> 03:42.518
- Suspects?
- There's suspect number one,

03:42.586 --> 03:44.520
His name is Harold Kalb.

03:44.588 --> 03:46.287
He's one of the organizers
of this protest group

03:46.355 --> 03:48.256
that was picketing the dinner.

03:48.324 --> 03:51.092
He made a scene during Brandt's
speech. Ten seconds later,

03:51.160 --> 03:54.962
the head table were dropping
like flies and Brandt was dead.

03:55.030 --> 03:57.332
I'll start talking to anyone
who had access to the food.

03:57.399 --> 03:59.434
All right.

04:04.305 --> 04:06.240
Hey!

04:06.307 --> 04:08.242
Is Brandt's wife
gonna make it?

04:08.309 --> 04:10.177
Her heart rate's erratic,
but she'll be stabilized.

04:10.245 --> 04:12.579
It looks a lot like salmonella,

04:12.647 --> 04:15.549
but food poisoning
usually takes a little longer.

04:15.617 --> 04:17.551
So what's with the protesters?

04:17.619 --> 04:20.719
Two years ago, Cooper-Weiss
released an anti-rejection drug

04:20.786 --> 04:23.322
called jannex. It shot
Cooper-Weiss to the big leagues,

04:23.390 --> 04:25.625
but it's been linked
to four deaths.

04:25.692 --> 04:27.660
So, do we believe
these claims?

04:27.727 --> 04:29.695
Not our focus.
Right now, we sweat this waiter

04:29.763 --> 04:32.197
and find out
what the hell happened here.

04:32.265 --> 04:36.001
<i>- I've been telling</i>-

04:36.069 --> 04:39.504
<i>I never even touched the food.</i>
<i> What about the champagne?</i>

04:39.572 --> 04:41.540
<i>It was already</i><i>on the table.</i>

04:41.607 --> 04:44.575
<i>All I did was open the bottle</i>
<i>and fill the glasses.</i>

04:44.643 --> 04:48.046
So you poured six glasses
at the head table,

04:48.113 --> 04:50.247
proposed a toast,
but you didn't take a sip.

04:50.315 --> 04:51.949
This is personal for you,
isn't it?

04:58.623 --> 05:00.590
We know you lost
your daughter.

05:00.658 --> 05:04.027
That's why you and your wife
started the class action suit.

05:05.997 --> 05:09.399
We waited two years
for a new kidney.

05:09.466 --> 05:11.301
Amy was seven years old,

05:11.368 --> 05:13.269
spending 20 hours
a week in dialysis.

05:13.337 --> 05:16.338
The doctor said everything
was supposed to be okay.

05:16.406 --> 05:19.842
To make sure that
there was no rejection,

05:19.910 --> 05:22.044
the doctor prescribed
a new wonder drug.

05:22.112 --> 05:24.646
Jannex.

05:24.715 --> 05:28.617
A week later,
her immune system shut down.

05:28.685 --> 05:31.120
And then the pneumonia hit her.

05:31.188 --> 05:33.088
Another day and she...

05:33.155 --> 05:34.923
- I can understand
why you would want to hurt

05:34.990 --> 05:36.925
the people who did this to her.

05:36.992 --> 05:39.527
I didn't put anything
in that champagne.

05:39.595 --> 05:42.230
I didn't want to hurt anyone,
just to shame them.

05:42.297 --> 05:44.799
Well, between us, a few suits
spewing their foie gras

05:44.867 --> 05:46.735
does have a certain
entertainment value.

05:46.802 --> 05:49.970
I wanted them
to confront what they did

05:50.038 --> 05:53.207
so that what happened to my Amy
never has to happen again.

05:53.275 --> 05:55.109
Then someone else
from your group did this.

05:55.176 --> 05:58.412
No! The people in my group
are the victims!

06:01.983 --> 06:04.017
I didn't poison anyone.

06:04.085 --> 06:05.952
<i>I ran</i>
<i>the catering staff.</i>

06:06.019 --> 06:08.087
They're all long-term employees.
There's no connection

06:08.155 --> 06:10.123
to Cooper-Weiss,
no criminal records.

06:10.190 --> 06:11.958
And they all travel
and work in groups,

06:12.025 --> 06:13.926
so they all have alibis
for at least two hours

06:13.994 --> 06:16.263
before the event.
How about kalb?

06:16.330 --> 06:18.865
I think he snuck in when the
catering staff was distracted.

06:18.932 --> 06:20.866
So he had access to the room

06:20.933 --> 06:22.801
and the champagne.
What about the other guests?

06:22.869 --> 06:24.936
From the reports
I've received,

06:25.004 --> 06:26.938
there was a bunch of people
milling about the head table,

06:27.006 --> 06:29.207
but none of them had
a problem with the company.

06:29.276 --> 06:30.342
Did we get anything
from the coroner's office?

06:30.410 --> 06:32.010
The lab did
Brandt's blood work.

06:32.078 --> 06:35.314
They found this
in the bottle of champagne.

06:35.382 --> 06:38.583
Digitoxin.

06:38.651 --> 06:41.586
It's a poison derived
from foxglove.

06:41.654 --> 06:43.621
It mimics salmonella,
but acts a whole lot quicker.

06:43.689 --> 06:45.923
So someone was trying to make
it look like food poisoning.

06:45.991 --> 06:49.460
But witnesses said they saw kalb
uncork the bottle at the table.

06:49.528 --> 06:51.462
I got them to check the cork.

06:51.530 --> 06:53.463
They said they found
a small puncture in the cork,

06:53.531 --> 06:55.732
like someone maybe injected
the bottle with poison.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.002
Why did Brandt die
and the others just get sick?

06:59.069 --> 07:00.504
Maybe he ingested more?

07:00.571 --> 07:02.806
Could he have had
a pre-existing condition

07:02.873 --> 07:05.008
that made him more vulnerable
to the digitoxin?

07:05.075 --> 07:07.076
The coroner's still working
on his medical records.

07:07.144 --> 07:10.413
But otherwise, the digitoxin should've
landed him in a hospital bed, not the grave.

07:10.480 --> 07:14.016
All right, keep looking.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.118
Klein still thinks
kalb's our best bet.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.721
Well, I can't confirm he knew
the poison was in that bottle.

07:18.789 --> 07:21.890
And I get the feeling
he was as surprised

07:21.958 --> 07:24.526
as everybody else when people
started getting sick.

07:24.593 --> 07:25.893
We don't have anybody else
with a better motive.

07:25.961 --> 07:27.929
If he wanted to poison
the head table,

07:27.996 --> 07:30.332
why isn't he
taking credit for it?

07:30.399 --> 07:32.534
I get the feeling
he just wanted to be heard.

07:32.601 --> 07:34.502
Don't let your sympathy
cloud your judgment.

07:34.570 --> 07:36.438
These people have
every reason to be upset.

07:36.505 --> 07:38.540
They're just regular folks
who became victims.

07:38.607 --> 07:40.674
Okay, so let's throw
the net wider.

07:40.742 --> 07:43.143
I'll get Dev to look
at the other protesters,

07:43.211 --> 07:45.646
see if any of them
have a history of violence.

07:45.714 --> 07:47.581
I'm glad to be back,

07:47.649 --> 07:49.416
but battling heat,
exhaustion, viruses,

07:49.484 --> 07:51.385
and snakes is not as bad

07:51.453 --> 07:53.420
as fixing doctors'
sloppy patient reports.

07:53.488 --> 07:55.456
Can you just give me a second?

07:57.391 --> 07:59.959
Hey, oz! You want to go
grab a coffee?

08:00.026 --> 08:02.762
Hey! Uh... I can't.
I'm so busy right now!

08:02.830 --> 08:04.964
I'm behind on paperwork.
Ryder's been all over my ass.

08:05.031 --> 08:08.701
Oh. I just thought, since
I've been away for a while...

08:08.769 --> 08:11.070
- yeah!
- ...You'd want to spend some time...

08:11.137 --> 08:13.104
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So, maybe after work...

08:13.172 --> 08:15.574
Yeah, I don't know...

08:15.641 --> 08:19.611
This is ryder. Okay.
I gotta go. I'll call you.

08:22.948 --> 08:24.949
<i>You're sure?</i>

08:25.017 --> 08:27.285
All right, send me
the results right away.

08:27.353 --> 08:30.721
That's why you're my favourite!
She's not my favourite.

08:30.789 --> 08:34.124
So I dug up Brandt's medical records.
Nothing that could combine

08:34.192 --> 08:36.760
with digitoxin to kill him.
And we already know

08:36.828 --> 08:38.696
the cardiac arrhythmia wasn't
triggered by the digitoxin.

08:38.764 --> 08:41.298
Anyone else
would have stopped there,

08:41.366 --> 08:43.299
but I always go
that extra mile.

08:43.368 --> 08:45.435
Especially with
self-congratulation.

08:45.503 --> 08:47.537
So I did another
tox screening on Brandt's glass,

08:47.605 --> 08:49.672
and guess what they found.

08:49.740 --> 08:53.443
Amygdaline.
That's a marker for cyanide.

08:53.511 --> 08:55.478
Yeah. It was
a trace so small

08:55.546 --> 08:57.313
that no one would've ever
really noticed it.

08:57.381 --> 08:59.649
But combined with the digitoxin,
it was enough to kill.

08:59.717 --> 09:02.484
- What about the other glasses?
- Brandt's was the only one that came up positive for cyanide.

09:02.552 --> 09:04.920
So whoever put the digitoxin
in the champagne

09:04.987 --> 09:06.922
also put the cyanide
in Brandt's glass.

09:06.989 --> 09:08.891
They must've wanted it
to look like food poisoning.

09:08.958 --> 09:12.795
So we're not looking
at a case of corporate mischief.

09:12.862 --> 09:15.731
Jeffrey Brandt
was targeted for murder.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.867
<i>This might change things.</i>

09:23.935 --> 09:26.036
Maybe Harold didn't kill
Brandt after all.

09:26.104 --> 09:27.438
What it means
is we've been looking

09:27.505 --> 09:29.373
at the wrong crime. The old
suspect might still apply.

09:29.441 --> 09:32.976
- Where do we go from here?
- Knowing we have a specific victim

09:33.044 --> 09:34.944
means we start looking
for specific motives.

09:35.011 --> 09:37.080
Well, I don't know
if I found a motive,

09:37.147 --> 09:39.515
but I did find someone
who had a beef with Brandt...

09:39.583 --> 09:42.885
So I was checking the security
tapes of a bank down the street

09:42.953 --> 09:46.556
to see when Harold entered
the hall. I couldn't see Harold,

09:46.623 --> 09:49.792
but I did see this.

09:49.859 --> 09:52.127
Jeffrey Brandt.

09:52.195 --> 09:54.096
Who's he's arguing with?

09:54.163 --> 09:55.964
Her name's Christa Merker.

09:56.031 --> 09:58.200
I talked with her at the scene.
She's V.P. Of production.

09:58.267 --> 10:00.969
She looks like one
very unhappy lady.

10:07.209 --> 10:09.410
Jeffrey was the best boss
that I ever had.

10:09.478 --> 10:13.013
Is there anyone in the office who
had a problem with the company?

10:13.081 --> 10:16.117
Nobody. Everybody
is here because they believe

10:16.184 --> 10:18.952
in Cooper-Weiss.
In what we do for people.

10:19.020 --> 10:20.921
The protesters
see it differently.

10:20.989 --> 10:23.289
They don't understand
Jeffrey's mission statement.

10:23.357 --> 10:26.392
"Ethics before profit."

10:29.096 --> 10:31.097
What were you
two arguing about?

10:31.165 --> 10:35.067
It was stupid. I found a small
discrepancy in our numbers.

10:35.136 --> 10:36.769
<i>If a quarter million</i>

10:36.837 --> 10:40.139
<i>can be considered small.</i>
<i> What was the discrepancy?</i>

10:40.206 --> 10:42.041
It was a bookkeeping error.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.044
I guess I shouldn't have asked
him about it before the dinner.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.946
He got mad,

10:48.014 --> 10:49.981
he said he needed
to keep his focus.

10:50.049 --> 10:52.550
Can you be more specific
about this bookkeeping error?

10:52.618 --> 10:55.253
I can't talk specifics
about company business.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.656
Even if it could help
find your boss' killer?

10:57.723 --> 10:59.257
<i>Jeffrey why you?</i>

10:59.324 --> 11:01.292
<i>Why did it have to be you?</i>

11:03.594 --> 11:06.229
I'm sorry...

11:06.297 --> 11:08.398
Okay, well...
Thank you for your time.

11:08.466 --> 11:11.468
Please call
if you think of anything else.

11:13.471 --> 11:15.572
Well, did you superpowers
get anything?

11:15.640 --> 11:17.541
Yeah, I think she knows
a lot more about the books

11:17.608 --> 11:19.608
than she's letting on. They
were off by a quarter million.

11:19.677 --> 11:21.610
Did you see where it went?

11:21.679 --> 11:23.680
No. But she was talking
to Jeffrey Brandt

11:23.747 --> 11:25.548
about something to do with it.

11:25.615 --> 11:27.616
So whoever took it
might have killed Brandt

11:27.685 --> 11:31.120
to cover their tracks.
There's our motive! Hold on.

11:31.188 --> 11:34.690
Hey! Okay, good.

11:34.757 --> 11:37.059
Thanks for getting back to me.

11:37.126 --> 11:41.163
Brandt's wife
is able to talk now.

11:41.230 --> 11:44.365
Mrs. Brandt is stable, but
heavily sedated, so go easy.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.501
- Okay.
- Cool.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.538
Mrs. Brandt?

11:51.606 --> 11:54.942
I'm sergeant McCluskey.
This is special agent Logan.

11:55.010 --> 11:57.511
We'd like to ask you
a few questions, if that's okay.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.816
Why did they do it?

12:01.883 --> 12:05.285
Why did... why did they kill
my husband?

12:05.353 --> 12:07.621
Well, that's what we'd like
to talk to you about.

12:07.689 --> 12:09.623
We found cyanide in his system.

12:09.691 --> 12:11.625
We believe your husband
was murdered.

12:11.693 --> 12:13.126
No...

12:13.194 --> 12:15.862
Do you know anyone who
would want to harm your husband?

12:15.930 --> 12:19.466
We know who did it.

12:19.534 --> 12:21.568
The protesters...

12:24.170 --> 12:27.273
My husband was a good man.

12:27.341 --> 12:30.676
I know this is difficult.

12:30.744 --> 12:32.911
Did your husband have
any specific enemies?

12:36.683 --> 12:39.251
Vallance is in charge of
the money. This is on his head!

12:39.318 --> 12:42.920
Did he ever talk about missing
money from the company?

12:42.988 --> 12:45.323
I don't know anything
about money.

12:47.926 --> 12:50.428
I can't help you.

12:50.496 --> 12:52.430
Please leave.

12:52.498 --> 12:54.565
Okay.

13:01.506 --> 13:03.674
- Yeah?

13:03.742 --> 13:05.743
One of the guests at the
Cooper-Weiss party came forward

13:05.810 --> 13:08.945
with some camera phone footage of
what happened at the head table.

13:09.013 --> 13:12.348
Anything interesting?

13:12.416 --> 13:14.984
In fact, it turns out he didn't
drink the champagne at all.

13:15.051 --> 13:17.487
Okay, we'll check
him out. Thanks.

13:17.554 --> 13:21.491
Claire thought about Brandt
talking to someone on the phone.

13:21.558 --> 13:23.826
He blamed Vallance for something
to do with the money.

13:23.894 --> 13:27.362
Let's see if he's to blame
for anything else.

13:30.166 --> 13:33.201
I'm surprised the iib
has gotten involved in this.

13:33.269 --> 13:36.037
Well, Jeffrey Brandt
was an important man;

13:36.105 --> 13:37.972
That makes his homicide
something we're interested in.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.974
Homicide? You're saying
he was murdered?

13:40.042 --> 13:43.844
Why? By who? Well, we were
hoping you could tell us.

13:43.912 --> 13:45.780
Well, I don't know. Someone
was trying to kill everybody

13:45.847 --> 13:47.915
at that table.
Not quite.

13:47.982 --> 13:51.051
His glass was laced with cyanide.
He was specifically targeted.

13:51.119 --> 13:53.220
You had a lot to gain
from his death.

13:53.288 --> 13:55.356
Oh, you're accusing me?

13:55.424 --> 13:58.559
We understand you're going to
be the new ceo of Cooper-Weiss.

13:58.627 --> 14:01.461
- Pending board approval.
- You two also had an argument

14:01.529 --> 14:03.964
about a missing sum of money.

14:04.032 --> 14:07.500
That was a discrepancy
in the books.

14:07.568 --> 14:09.536
It has been made right.
A simple accounting error.

14:09.603 --> 14:11.471
There were other
differences as well.

14:11.539 --> 14:14.441
Look, he was an idealist;
I'm a bottom-line guy.

14:14.508 --> 14:16.342
But the fact is,
we needed each other.

14:16.409 --> 14:19.411
You guys had no problems?

14:19.479 --> 14:21.180
<i>No, you can't go on like this.
No, listen to me.</i>

14:21.248 --> 14:23.149
<i>No, you listen to me!</i>
<i>We're done.</i>

14:23.217 --> 14:25.218
<i>All right, fine.</i>
<i>I'll meet you at the magnolia.</i>

14:25.285 --> 14:28.955
Nothing that couldn't be
sorted out peacefully.

14:29.022 --> 14:31.189
So you were
at the head table,

14:31.257 --> 14:33.391
yet you didn't drink
the champagne.

14:33.459 --> 14:35.793
I'm on antibiotics.
You can check with Dr. lang.

14:35.862 --> 14:37.863
My assistant will be happy
to give you his number.

14:37.930 --> 14:41.266
- We'll do that.
- Look, if you really want to know who killed Jeffrey,

14:41.334 --> 14:44.236
why aren't you talking to the people
who were howling outside our dinner?

14:44.303 --> 14:48.272
- The protesters.
- The protesters. Did you know last week,

14:48.340 --> 14:50.274
one of them dumped a bucket
of blood on Jeffrey's car

14:50.342 --> 14:52.542
as he was leaving
the lot. Kalb.

14:52.610 --> 14:54.678
The waiter, yeah.
Harold Kalb, we know.

14:54.746 --> 14:58.015
No. I'm not talking about Harold. I'm
talking about his wife, Rebecca.

15:00.986 --> 15:03.319
Vallance was lying
to us about something.

15:03.387 --> 15:05.388
I got him on his phone
arguing with someone.

15:05.455 --> 15:08.057
I think it might have been
Brandt. He said they were done.

15:08.125 --> 15:11.194
You know, I kind of felt like they were on
the point of some kind of break. You know,

15:11.262 --> 15:13.162
maybe Brandt's murder
was the next step.

15:13.230 --> 15:15.164
I'll have Dev
check the phone records.

15:15.232 --> 15:18.234
I did throw the blood
on his car.

15:18.302 --> 15:20.969
Someone had to get
through to him.

15:21.037 --> 15:23.372
We have a witness who believes
you are capable of a lot more.

15:23.439 --> 15:26.074
<i>That wouldn't happen</i>
<i>to be Thomas Vallance?</i>

15:28.144 --> 15:31.713
<i>He's been trying</i>
<i>to discredit us for months.</i>

15:31.781 --> 15:33.882
He knows our daughter
was the victim,

15:33.950 --> 15:35.816
that her story
will sell newspapers.

15:35.884 --> 15:37.551
What story is that?

15:37.619 --> 15:40.955
That jannex
has fatal side effects.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.524
They knew
and they covered it up.

15:50.365 --> 15:52.933
So you must really hate
Jeffrey Brandt.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.970
His product killed
my daughter.

15:57.038 --> 16:00.040
But that doesn't mean
that I wanted to kill him.

16:00.107 --> 16:02.842
Was there anyone else from your
group who was out for revenge?

16:02.910 --> 16:05.312
Why are you picking
on the victims?

16:05.379 --> 16:08.747
My husband was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

16:08.815 --> 16:11.016
Leave us alone!

16:12.752 --> 16:15.787
So I searched for members
of kalb's organization

16:15.855 --> 16:17.456
and cross-referenced with
a list of threatening letters

16:17.523 --> 16:20.826
to the company. One of them
stood out among the rest.

16:20.893 --> 16:23.694
It was sent by this guy:

16:23.762 --> 16:26.297
Charlie enzo, 36 years old.

16:26.365 --> 16:28.266
He was an early
test case for jannex.

16:28.334 --> 16:30.468
This guy sent
a series of letters

16:30.535 --> 16:33.338
that could be described
as death threats to the company.

16:33.405 --> 16:34.439
He was a member
of the jannex class action suit,

16:34.506 --> 16:36.341
but dropped out
three weeks ago.

16:36.408 --> 16:40.077
This was his last known photo.

16:40.144 --> 16:43.046
- So... what? He's dead?
- Well, there's no obituary, but here's where it gets weird.

16:43.114 --> 16:47.050
Apparently he left his apartment
and just disappeared.

16:47.118 --> 16:49.486
He was last seen at the hospital
for his dialysis treatment.

16:52.457 --> 16:55.491
Charlie enzo. He was in about
three weeks ago. On the fourth.

16:55.558 --> 16:58.461
This is going to take a while.
You want to grab a coffee?

16:58.528 --> 17:00.196
Uh, yeah.
I'll walk with you.

17:00.263 --> 17:02.731
- Okay.
- Cool.

17:02.799 --> 17:04.766
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

17:04.834 --> 17:06.768
And you have
to answer me honestly.

17:06.836 --> 17:08.770
Depends on the question.

17:08.838 --> 17:10.739
You think oz and I are good
for each other, right?

17:10.807 --> 17:14.409
Wow! I should've
told you to lie.

17:14.477 --> 17:16.478
- What do you want?
- Decaf.

17:16.545 --> 17:18.445
- You want decaf?
- It just...

17:18.513 --> 17:21.249
It kind of feels like he's been
avoiding me lately.

17:21.317 --> 17:23.751
Okay, look. Uh...

17:23.819 --> 17:27.387
Oz is a...
He's a sensitive guy.

17:27.454 --> 17:31.158
You know, when you suddenly left
to follow your dream,

17:31.226 --> 17:33.027
it kind of took the wind
out of his sails.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.828
I just think he doesn't want
to get hurt again.

17:34.896 --> 17:37.164
- I didn't mean to hurt him.
- I know.

17:37.232 --> 17:39.900
It's just that when
your dream goes sideways,

17:39.967 --> 17:43.403
it doesn't mean you can come back and
expect everything to be like it was before.

17:43.470 --> 17:47.140
What if I told you my dream
didn't go sideways?

17:47.207 --> 17:50.443
Six weeks away
can focus a girl.

17:50.511 --> 17:53.846
I just kept reading
all of his emails,

17:53.914 --> 17:56.215
and I knew I had to come back.
You quit?

17:56.283 --> 17:59.617
I missed him.
Stupid, huh?

17:59.685 --> 18:01.686
So what do I do?

18:01.754 --> 18:05.123
Well, uh... I don't know. This
is going to take a little time.

18:05.191 --> 18:07.792
You got to finesse this,
a little tlc.

18:07.860 --> 18:10.795
- I could... get him something.
- Right.

18:10.863 --> 18:12.764
- Something, something special.
- It's got to be good!

18:12.831 --> 18:16.500
This is the guy who got you
a mailboxfull of roses,

18:16.568 --> 18:18.669
who put you in a hot-air
balloon, tried to take you away

18:18.736 --> 18:21.439
to the Caribbean on a whim.
The leafs.

18:21.506 --> 18:23.674
They play the pens tomorrow
night. He'd kill for tickets.

18:23.741 --> 18:26.077
- He'd kill for those tickets.
- Thank you, tobe.

18:26.144 --> 18:28.179
- My pleasure.
- Oh! Here we go.

18:28.246 --> 18:32.549
Enzo comma Charles. Yeah, we do
have a pick-up address listed.

18:32.616 --> 18:34.650
- Yeah? Nice.
- But you'll never guess where.

18:34.718 --> 18:38.088
Cool. Thank you.

18:38.155 --> 18:40.457
<i>This is where</i>
<i>a terminal patient lives?</i>

18:40.524 --> 18:42.959
Yeah! I'd like
his healthcare plan.

18:43.026 --> 18:45.661
Well, if you get anything,
go easy on him, okay?

18:45.729 --> 18:47.863
He might be extremely
vulnerable.

18:52.703 --> 18:54.737
Charlie enzo?

18:59.009 --> 19:02.377
Looks like the
party's over, ladies.

19:07.513 --> 19:10.349
We need to talk to you
about Jeffrey Brandt's murder.

19:10.416 --> 19:14.185
- Oh, he's dead?
- He beat me.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.221
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

19:16.288 --> 19:18.223
I had nothing to do with it.
Then allow me

19:18.290 --> 19:21.158
to read from the letter
that you wrote to the company.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.160
"Before I die, I'm going to see.

19:23.228 --> 19:26.564
"Jeffrey Brandt skinned
and fed to rabid wolverines."

19:26.631 --> 19:30.668
Okay. Maybe I went a bit far
with the Wolverine thing.

19:30.736 --> 19:33.337
But I'm
in a different place now.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.406
I've grown to accept my fate,

19:39.377 --> 19:42.445
when they paid you off.

19:42.513 --> 19:45.615
Cooper-Weiss
gave you $250,000.

19:45.683 --> 19:48.351
We checked your bank account.
You want to tell us otherwise?

19:48.419 --> 19:51.454
What do you want me
to say? I took money.

19:51.522 --> 19:53.055
- From Brandt...
- From the company.

19:53.123 --> 19:55.724
I signed a letter saying
I'd dropped out of the suit.

19:55.792 --> 19:58.527
I felt bad abandoning
the others,

19:58.595 --> 20:02.131
but we weren't gonna win.
What else could I do?

20:02.199 --> 20:05.401
Look at me now.

20:05.468 --> 20:07.669
You know, I used
to run marathons.

20:07.737 --> 20:11.139
Now I can't run
across the street.

20:11.207 --> 20:13.975
- I do understand your anger.
- No you don't.

20:14.043 --> 20:17.812
I sunk every penny I had into
beating those bastards.

20:17.880 --> 20:21.316
For every lawyer I threw
at them, they threw two back.

20:21.384 --> 20:23.351
But hey,

20:23.419 --> 20:25.286
at least I'm going out
with a bang.

20:25.353 --> 20:27.988
By spending your money
on booze and girls?

20:28.056 --> 20:31.725
No, not all of it.
If you must know,

20:31.793 --> 20:34.561
I made an anonymous donation
to the anti-jannex group

20:34.629 --> 20:36.363
to help them with
their legal fees.

20:36.431 --> 20:40.801
I gave up.
It doesn't mean they have to.

20:42.836 --> 20:45.004
So, enzo's donation
checks out.

20:45.072 --> 20:48.641
The class action suit received
an anonymous $100,000 donation

20:48.708 --> 20:50.376
four hours after he took out
the money order,

20:50.444 --> 20:52.445
and left four days after that.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.613
- So where did it go?
- Nobody knows.

20:54.681 --> 20:56.849
Maybe it was someone paying to
take the fight to the next level.

20:56.917 --> 20:58.817
But if the poisoning
was a paid hit

20:58.884 --> 21:01.353
then who is our mysterious
outsider? It doesn't seem to be

21:01.421 --> 21:03.588
Harold Kalb...
Whoever it was

21:03.656 --> 21:05.824
would've had to access
to the champagne and the glasses

21:05.891 --> 21:08.260
before the meal. But with
all the people milling about

21:08.328 --> 21:10.829
the lobby, anybody in the room
could've had opportunity.

21:10.896 --> 21:13.998
And they would've had to have the seating
plan to know which glass was Brandt's.

21:14.066 --> 21:16.834
What about Vallance?
He hated Brandt.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.970
He paid out the quarter million

21:19.037 --> 21:21.005
and he didn't drink the bubbly.

21:21.073 --> 21:23.907
He had a prescription for antibiotics,
I double-checked with his dentist.

21:23.976 --> 21:26.110
You've never bent the rules
when you're on antibiotics?

21:26.178 --> 21:29.745
Point taken. But, if he were
the killer, don't you think

21:29.813 --> 21:32.215
he would have drunk the
digitoxin to cover his tracks?

21:32.283 --> 21:34.150
When in doubt,
follow the money.

21:34.218 --> 21:38.021
So, I just have
a few new questions.

21:38.089 --> 21:40.690
We were actually able
to meet up with Charlie enzo.

21:40.757 --> 21:44.727
He's the guy who received
the missing $250,000.

21:44.795 --> 21:47.729
You guys are good. Even I couldn't
figure out where it went.

21:47.797 --> 21:51.633
Right. Well, I think you know
who paid it to him.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.869
<i>Jeffrey, you know Vallance</i>
<i>took the money.</i>

21:53.936 --> 21:57.706
<i>We could tell them.</i>

21:57.773 --> 22:00.409
Thank you.

22:00.477 --> 22:03.511
So...

22:03.578 --> 22:06.714
Thomas Vallance.

22:06.781 --> 22:08.849
He had a lot to gain
from Jeffrey's death.

22:08.917 --> 22:11.052
What were they fighting about?

22:11.120 --> 22:13.054
After jannex,

22:13.122 --> 22:15.123
Jeffrey wanted more transparency
in his testing.

22:15.190 --> 22:17.690
He planned to introduce
testing by an independent body.

22:17.758 --> 22:19.959
I take it that's not
how jannex was tested.

22:20.028 --> 22:23.530
We pay the lab a lot of money. Sometimes
they don't want to give us bad news.

22:23.597 --> 22:26.533
They don't want to? Or they've
been forced to stay quiet?

22:28.336 --> 22:32.872
Was Vallance in charge
of product testing?

22:32.940 --> 22:35.607
I know your boss preached
ethics over profits.

22:35.675 --> 22:37.676
I know you believe that too.

22:37.744 --> 22:40.979
If Vallance had anything
to do with Brandt's death,

22:41.048 --> 22:42.781
we need to know.

22:42.849 --> 22:44.850
I decided to look into
the jannex product testing

22:44.918 --> 22:46.952
after your first visit.

22:50.156 --> 22:53.291
It took me four hours to find
it. Failed test results,

22:53.359 --> 22:55.660
along with a draft of a letter

22:55.727 --> 22:58.930
that Jeffrey was going to send to the board
to make a case for Vallance's dismissal.

22:58.997 --> 23:01.166
- He was going to fire him.
- Jeffrey wanted a clean slate

23:01.233 --> 23:03.034
before his proposal

23:03.102 --> 23:05.335
for independent drug testing
was announced.

23:05.403 --> 23:07.938
Also, you'll find
a funding plan

23:08.005 --> 23:10.307
to pay back the victims
for their losses.

23:10.375 --> 23:12.309
Jeffrey, why did you do it?

23:12.377 --> 23:15.512
It shouldn't
have happened to you.

23:15.580 --> 23:18.082
I think your boss
would've been proud.

23:29.693 --> 23:32.061
Okay, you are officially
my favourite paramedic

23:32.129 --> 23:35.030
of all time. Favourite, wow!
What about Toby?

23:35.099 --> 23:37.066
Toby... nah, the name
doesn't really ring a bell.

23:37.133 --> 23:39.101
- Hey, oz!
- Sandy!

23:39.168 --> 23:41.769
Come meet the partner
of the year.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.739
Okay, it's not that big
a deal, the tickets were free.

23:44.807 --> 23:46.475
What tickets?

23:46.542 --> 23:48.910
Leafs-penguins tonight,
front row golds!

23:48.978 --> 23:50.312
Do you mind if I paint
my face, is that cool?

23:50.379 --> 23:52.780
Uh, no. No, it's not.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.816
It was nice to see you
and I will see you later.

23:55.883 --> 24:00.087
- That's... some partner.
- I know, right?

24:00.155 --> 24:02.689
So how's it going?

24:02.757 --> 24:06.460
I just, uh...

24:06.528 --> 24:10.396
I wanted to tell you
that they are doing...

24:10.464 --> 24:12.599
construction outside
the ambulance bay.

24:12.667 --> 24:15.301
That's what you wanted
to tell me?

24:15.369 --> 24:17.537
Yeah, they made a...

24:17.605 --> 24:20.507
A hole... it's just...
It's deep.

24:20.574 --> 24:22.909
They made
a deep hole. Okay.

24:22.977 --> 24:25.645
I will watch out
for it. Thank you.

24:25.712 --> 24:29.581
That's... that's it.
I gotta go.

24:29.650 --> 24:32.618
All right, okay.

24:43.162 --> 24:44.996
Hey.

24:46.966 --> 24:48.967
Toby Logan! Hey,
just the guy I'm looking for.

24:49.035 --> 24:50.902
- Right on!
- Michelle asked me

24:50.970 --> 24:53.271
to look into Vallance and Brandt
meeting at the magnolia.

24:53.338 --> 24:56.307
It turns out it was the magnolia
hotel on frame street.

24:56.375 --> 24:57.408
When did they meet?

24:57.476 --> 24:59.242
That's where
it gets messed up.

24:59.310 --> 25:01.211
Sure, there were phone
records to Brandt,

25:01.279 --> 25:03.180
but that's not
who Vallance met there.

25:03.247 --> 25:05.149
Security cameras in the lobby

25:05.216 --> 25:07.117
picked him up meeting
Claire Brandt

25:07.185 --> 25:09.086
three times in the last month
and heading up to a room.

25:09.154 --> 25:11.155
Okay, what's he doing
with Brandt's wife?

25:11.222 --> 25:14.023
Exactly. Maybe she's not the
devoted wife she claimed to be.

25:14.091 --> 25:15.992
Huh.
All I know is one poisoned glass

25:16.060 --> 25:17.827
of wine and they have control
over the whole company.

25:17.895 --> 25:20.963
And Claire and Vallance sat
on either side of Brandt.

25:21.031 --> 25:23.166
You think one of them
could have killed him?

25:23.233 --> 25:26.169
Maybe both. All I know is
that's motive and opportunity.

25:26.236 --> 25:28.671
Now all we need is evidence.
Exactly.

25:28.739 --> 25:30.706
You're getting good at this.

25:30.773 --> 25:34.676
<i>June 2nd, June 9th</i>
<i>and June 12th.</i>

25:34.777 --> 25:37.378
<i>What were you doing</i>
<i>at the hotel magnolia</i>

25:37.446 --> 25:40.281
<i>with Thomas Vallance?</i>

25:40.349 --> 25:42.517
My husband bought a number
of shares of the company

25:42.585 --> 25:45.053
in my name
and Thomas asked to meet

25:45.121 --> 25:47.788
to discuss
some tax ramifications.

25:52.027 --> 25:55.229
We know you two
were having an affair.

25:56.932 --> 25:58.966
Were you working with him?

25:59.034 --> 26:00.935
Did you help him kill
your husband?

26:01.002 --> 26:03.036
No!

26:03.104 --> 26:05.972
I didn't kill my husband.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.676
So who did? Vallance?

26:10.745 --> 26:13.847
I don't know.

26:13.914 --> 26:18.050
It was a confusing time.
Cooperweiss was doing well,

26:18.118 --> 26:20.018
but there were storm clouds
on the horizon.

26:20.086 --> 26:23.288
My husband

26:23.322 --> 26:25.557
was planning something

26:25.591 --> 26:28.627
that didn't make
sound business sense..

26:28.694 --> 26:31.130
The indedepent testing.

26:31.231 --> 26:33.465
Tom was convinced
it was too costly

26:33.532 --> 26:35.499
and that it would hurt
the company,

26:35.567 --> 26:39.270
and he asked me
to help convince my husband.

26:39.337 --> 26:41.371
So then what happened?

26:41.438 --> 26:45.375
So he asked to meet
at a hotel,

26:45.442 --> 26:49.379
strictly business.

26:49.446 --> 26:52.348
But he had charm
and he had swagger

26:52.416 --> 26:56.386
and he had wine.

26:56.453 --> 27:00.256
It was very good wine.

27:00.323 --> 27:03.458
I was so lonely!

27:05.295 --> 27:08.463
And I was so angry at Jeffrey

27:08.531 --> 27:10.465
for spending so much time
at the office.

27:10.533 --> 27:14.468
But you know what
the worst part of this is?

27:14.536 --> 27:17.638
Vallance was just using me.

27:17.706 --> 27:21.843
It's like I was some piece
being moved around in some game

27:21.911 --> 27:25.379
between him and my husband.

27:25.447 --> 27:27.682
I thought he cared about me.

27:30.118 --> 27:32.152
How could I have been so blind?

27:36.457 --> 27:38.425
Jeffrey never
found out about it,

27:38.492 --> 27:40.861
but I promised myself

27:40.929 --> 27:43.596
that I would make it up
to him somehow.

27:46.300 --> 27:49.936
I never had the chance.

27:50.003 --> 27:51.838
<i>All the more</i>
<i>reason to look at Vallance</i>

27:51.905 --> 27:53.807
for the murder.
Because he had an affair?

27:53.874 --> 27:55.775
That makes him guilty
of bad judgment.

27:55.843 --> 27:58.144
He hid the results
of the jannex trials.

27:58.212 --> 28:01.347
He was at war with Brandt, he was sleeping
with the guy's wife. How much more do we need?

28:01.414 --> 28:04.516
- Proof.
- Who brought him in here?

28:04.584 --> 28:06.785
You did. Look,
whoever did this

28:06.853 --> 28:08.754
has a sophisticated
knowledge of poisons.

28:08.822 --> 28:10.789
Vallance is a businessman,
not a scientist.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.091
Yeah, but he works
in a company full of scientists.

28:13.159 --> 28:16.294
He has access, motive
and opportunity. Stay on him.

28:16.363 --> 28:18.396
<i>My relationship with Claire</i>

28:18.464 --> 28:20.665
has no relevance here.
Things like this happen.

28:20.733 --> 28:23.668
You mean like pay-offs
to your victims?

28:23.736 --> 28:25.870
I didn't have to pay anybody,
the courts were on our side.

28:25.937 --> 28:27.772
What about the money
that you paid Charles enzo?

28:27.840 --> 28:30.174
That money came
from a slush fund.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.243
Look, enzo was hurting
our credibility

28:32.310 --> 28:34.745
and I did what any other person
in my position would do:

28:34.812 --> 28:36.780
I paid him, and fairly.

28:36.848 --> 28:38.648
Some people would call
that misappropriation.

28:38.716 --> 28:40.484
Did you know that Brandt
planned on firing you?

28:40.551 --> 28:42.886
That's absurd! My position
was completely safe.

28:42.953 --> 28:44.855
He wouldn't have fired me,

28:44.922 --> 28:47.023
he couldn't afford to.

28:47.091 --> 28:48.992
Look, you can't
hang this on me.

28:49.059 --> 28:51.293
I did not kill Jeffrey Brandt!

28:51.361 --> 28:54.764
Someone is trying to take this company down
and Jeffrey's murder had to do with that.

28:54.831 --> 28:57.933
- So who is trying to take this company down, then?
- We found out last week

28:58.001 --> 28:59.935
that someone
hacked into our system,

29:00.003 --> 29:01.937
was rooting through our files.

29:02.005 --> 29:04.206
Specifically security and
r and d. Why don't you ask them?

29:07.793 --> 29:09.994
<i>So I pulled some strings.</i>

29:10.062 --> 29:12.163
I got I.P. Routings
to the intrusions

29:12.231 --> 29:14.165
into the Cooper-Weiss
system.

29:14.233 --> 29:17.102
Now, they all went through
ghost servers in Europe.

29:17.169 --> 29:20.104
I'll give you three guesses as
to whose I.P. Address came up?

29:20.171 --> 29:24.241
- How about you just tell us?
- Rebecca kalb.

29:24.309 --> 29:27.077
Turns out she has a background
in I.T. Security.

29:27.145 --> 29:30.714
She made intrusions into
all departments in the company,

29:30.781 --> 29:33.350
but she focused on research
and development.

29:33.418 --> 29:36.252
Okay, but that doesn't necessarily
connect her to the poisoning.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.621
One of the documents

29:38.688 --> 29:40.723
that she accessed actually had
physical details of the venue,

29:40.790 --> 29:43.626
including the seating chart
for the dinner.

29:43.693 --> 29:47.630
She has some questions
to answer.

29:52.901 --> 29:55.270
<i>- You have one new message.</i>

29:58.974 --> 30:00.942
Nice.

30:09.651 --> 30:12.019
If you had let me paint my face,

30:12.086 --> 30:14.087
they totally
would've won that game.

30:14.156 --> 30:16.023
Oh, please! At least we got
to see some nice goals,

30:16.090 --> 30:18.925
too bad they were in the wrong net.
Yeah.

30:18.993 --> 30:21.495
Um, are we not going
to your place?

30:21.563 --> 30:23.630
My place is kind of undergoing
a bit of a makeover

30:23.697 --> 30:25.632
right now, so...

30:25.699 --> 30:27.300
And Toby's not going to mind?

30:27.368 --> 30:29.969
Toby? Nah,
I don't think so.

30:38.111 --> 30:40.512
I'm kind of thirsty.

30:40.580 --> 30:43.948
There's drinks.
Toby has drinks.

30:56.995 --> 30:59.797
- Just... give me one minute.
- Okay.

30:59.864 --> 31:03.501
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, one minute, sure.

31:03.569 --> 31:08.372
Hey, Toby, listen.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.841
Don't get mad, but Elyse
and I are using your place

31:10.909 --> 31:12.909
for a couple hours, tops.

31:12.976 --> 31:15.144
And maybe grabbing
a couple beers and some snacks.

31:15.213 --> 31:18.748
Oz, what happened with Sandy? She bought you
tickets to the game, and you bail on her?

31:18.816 --> 31:20.750
Wait, what?

31:25.989 --> 31:29.425
This is information that I could
really have used yesterday!

31:29.492 --> 31:31.960
Oz? You got my beer yet?

31:32.028 --> 31:36.332
Okay, I gotta go.
I gotta go, bye.

31:40.704 --> 31:42.605
<i>You lied to us.</i>

31:42.672 --> 31:44.639
It seems you've taken

31:44.707 --> 31:47.942
a very active role in the war
against Cooper-Weiss.

31:48.009 --> 31:50.211
You hacked the specs to
the dinner and you helped plan

31:50.279 --> 31:52.980
your husband's little stunt.
Yes.

31:53.048 --> 31:57.151
I orchestrated Harold's
infiltration of the banquet,

31:57.219 --> 31:59.286
but poison was never part
of the plan.

31:59.354 --> 32:01.288
Maybe he did it without
your knowledge.

32:01.356 --> 32:03.357
He was one of the only people

32:03.424 --> 32:05.325
who had access to the champagne
and Brandt's glass.

32:05.393 --> 32:07.994
He'd never do that. Never.

32:13.568 --> 32:15.901
You were there
inside the restaurant.

32:15.969 --> 32:18.237
No,

32:18.305 --> 32:20.273
I was outside in the crowd.

32:26.179 --> 32:28.247
<i>My wife didn't do anything.</i>

32:28.315 --> 32:30.650
And neither did I.
We know she opened the door

32:30.717 --> 32:32.784
for you. We know
she was in the restaurant.

32:32.851 --> 32:34.786
What, you think
Rebecca did it?

32:34.853 --> 32:37.756
No! She just got me in.

32:41.860 --> 32:46.531
I got Harold in,
but I never poisoned anyone.

32:46.599 --> 32:49.000
Neither did he.
It's getting very hard

32:49.067 --> 32:51.135
to distinguish the truth
from the lies here.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.104
Look, I'm sure there was a time
you were left alone

32:53.172 --> 32:55.273
with the champagne
and that's when you did it.

32:55.340 --> 32:58.042
No! I never saw
the champagne.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.077
She wasn't near
the champagne.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.479
It's like I told you.
I came in...

33:02.547 --> 33:04.781
I changed into
the waiter's outfit.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.883
I just wanted to say my piece

33:06.951 --> 33:09.152
and get thrown out...

33:09.220 --> 33:11.221
Or get arrested.
It would all be good press.

33:11.289 --> 33:14.090
- So you lost sight of your wife.
- For a few seconds.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.092
That's all it would take
for her to inject the bottle

33:16.160 --> 33:18.695
with digitoxin and to coat
Brandt's glass with cyanide.

33:18.762 --> 33:20.662
No. She didn't poison them.
You think my wife would do that

33:20.730 --> 33:22.631
knowing that
I'd look guilty for it?

33:22.699 --> 33:24.700
Well, that's a good question.

33:24.767 --> 33:26.901
Why would she want to frame you?
She wouldn't!

33:26.969 --> 33:30.038
All right, if she wouldn't
and you didn't, then who did?

33:30.105 --> 33:32.106
I don't know!

33:32.174 --> 33:35.143
The bottle was on the table.
All I did was open it

33:35.211 --> 33:38.814
and fill the glasses.

33:42.051 --> 33:44.184
Can we talk for a second?

33:49.491 --> 33:51.925
We have to test
the champagne glasses again.

33:51.993 --> 33:54.995
- What are we looking for?
- We'll find Vallance's prints

33:55.063 --> 33:58.531
on Brandt's glass.
Vallance pushed his glass away,

33:58.599 --> 34:00.633
Brandt picked it up. The poison
was meant for Vallance:

34:00.701 --> 34:02.669
The wrong man was murdered.

34:09.186 --> 34:12.755
You were right. There was a partial
print on the base of Brandt's glass

34:12.822 --> 34:14.924
that we thought belonged
to the wait staff.

34:14.991 --> 34:16.992
But it was matched
to Thomas Vallance.

34:17.060 --> 34:19.293
Question now is,
who'd want to kill Vallance?

34:19.362 --> 34:22.097
- Okay, so we're back at the beginning.
- Maybe not.

34:22.165 --> 34:24.132
Dev, do you have access
to Brandt's email account?

34:24.199 --> 34:26.301
- Yeah, why?
- Check for anything to do

34:26.369 --> 34:28.268
with jannex testing.

34:28.337 --> 34:30.204
Whoever tried to kill Vallance
knew he was responsible

34:30.272 --> 34:33.440
for the deaths. Right, right.
Someone Jeffrey Brandt told,

34:33.509 --> 34:37.011
someone loyal to him. Someone
with a background in chemistry.

34:39.114 --> 34:41.181
Yeah, good call.

34:41.248 --> 34:45.284
Brandt sent the information to
Christa Merker three weeks ago.

34:45.353 --> 34:47.521
She told us she didn't learn
about it until yesterday.

34:47.589 --> 34:50.255
Well, all the details
of the jannex trial are there.

34:50.324 --> 34:53.560
Christa and Brandt knew
that jannex was a killer...

34:53.628 --> 34:56.228
and they both knew that Vallance
hid the results and paid off enzo.

34:56.297 --> 34:58.498
I read Christa and when
she said, "why'd you do it?",

34:58.565 --> 35:01.400
I thought she was innocent,
but really she was just upset

35:01.468 --> 35:03.335
that the wrong person
had been poisoned.

35:03.403 --> 35:06.138
Didn't she say that Vallance
was going to be fired?

35:06.206 --> 35:08.273
Why didn't she just wait
for Brandt's to get rid of him?

35:08.341 --> 35:10.242
I don't know, but I saw
Vallance threatening him.

35:10.310 --> 35:13.012
- Sounds like you've got your killer.
- Let's go talk to Christa.

35:24.423 --> 35:27.759
You knew the truth about jannex
for a long time, didn't you?

35:27.827 --> 35:30.861
Christa, we know
you didn't want this to happen.

35:30.929 --> 35:33.531
We know you didn't want
to kill Jeffrey.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.868
So what happened?

35:37.936 --> 35:41.672
When Jeffrey found out,

35:41.740 --> 35:43.807
he was horrified.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.776
He didn't tell anyone but me,

35:46.844 --> 35:50.747
said we had to play it smart.

35:50.814 --> 35:53.716
Vallance
is a very powerful man.

35:53.784 --> 35:56.653
We needed a solution

35:56.720 --> 35:59.088
that his lawyers
would never be able to sink.

35:59.156 --> 36:01.591
The way he sunk
the jannex trials.

36:01.659 --> 36:04.660
Those people didn't
deserve to die.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.828
We did this to them.

36:06.896 --> 36:09.798
Our product.

36:09.866 --> 36:12.534
All because Vallance
corrupted the test results.

36:12.602 --> 36:16.038
So your argument
with Jeffrey was about Vallance.

36:16.105 --> 36:18.940
When Vallance found out
that he was going to be fired,

36:19.007 --> 36:21.943
he threatened to blame
a cover-up on Cooper-Weiss

36:22.010 --> 36:24.011
instead of himself.

36:24.079 --> 36:26.280
It would have ruined
the company.

36:26.347 --> 36:28.883
- So Brandt relented.
- It was blackmail.

36:28.951 --> 36:31.619
He had to give in
for the good of the company,

36:31.687 --> 36:35.722
which meant Vallance would stay

36:35.790 --> 36:37.724
and another jannex
could happen in the future.

36:37.792 --> 36:39.960
So you felt like
you had no choice.

36:40.027 --> 36:43.730
One life lost to spare many.

36:43.798 --> 36:46.399
Well, a judge will take
your story into consideration.

36:46.467 --> 36:48.134
I killed my mentor.

36:48.202 --> 36:50.403
What's a judge going
to say about that?

36:50.471 --> 36:53.906
You're going to have
to come with us, Christa.

36:53.974 --> 36:57.209
I don't think so.

37:02.315 --> 37:04.984
What did you take?

37:05.051 --> 37:06.718
Did you take cyanide?

37:26.971 --> 37:29.873
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

37:29.941 --> 37:32.876
Look, our job was
to solve a crime,

37:32.944 --> 37:35.512
and we did.
That's a win.

37:35.579 --> 37:37.748
Christa thought she was doing
the right thing.

37:37.815 --> 37:39.982
For the victims,
for her company,

37:40.050 --> 37:41.984
for the people
who'd be hurt in the future.

37:42.052 --> 37:44.987
And she killed a man.
The law still frowns on that.

37:45.055 --> 37:47.489
The world is a better place
today than it was yesterday.

37:47.557 --> 37:50.660
Is it? There's
two people dead,

37:50.727 --> 37:52.962
and a man responsible
for killing

37:53.030 --> 37:56.031
four innocent people walks away. How do we
know he's not going to kill more people?

37:56.098 --> 37:58.700
- If he does, we'll be there.
- So that's what we do?

37:58.768 --> 38:02.137
We wait for the bodies
to pile up?

38:02.204 --> 38:03.972
I sent the information
to the department of health

38:04.040 --> 38:05.940
and welfare.
It's in their court now.

38:06.008 --> 38:08.309
What'll they do? They're going
to sweep it under the carpet.

38:08.377 --> 38:10.978
I don't like it either.
But there are official channels.

38:11.046 --> 38:14.682
Thomas Vallance and Cooper-Weiss
are no longer our job.

38:26.227 --> 38:28.527
That said,

38:28.595 --> 38:31.698
maybe sometimes,
these things are better handled

38:31.765 --> 38:34.067
through unofficial channels.

38:50.149 --> 38:54.019
- Hey!
- Hey!

38:54.087 --> 38:55.887
You guys enjoy the game?

38:55.955 --> 38:59.890
Not as much as the pens fans.

39:02.060 --> 39:04.494
Just treat him well, okay?

39:04.562 --> 39:06.463
You've got yourself
one hell of a guy.

39:06.531 --> 39:09.934
That's the thing.

39:10.001 --> 39:12.770
I was actually going
to give you the same speech.

39:14.940 --> 39:18.308
I should get back to this.

39:18.376 --> 39:22.412
- Bye!
- Bye!

39:27.151 --> 39:30.153
- Sandy.
- Sorry for coming unannounced.

39:30.221 --> 39:33.589
Oh, no, it's good.
I wanted to talk to you too.

39:33.657 --> 39:36.226
- It's about you and Elyse?
- You know?

39:36.293 --> 39:38.560
I mean, not that there's
anything to know.

39:38.628 --> 39:40.729
Nothing happened.

39:40.797 --> 39:42.064
It almost did, but I...

39:42.132 --> 39:44.032
I couldn't go through with it.

39:44.100 --> 39:45.834
Why not?

39:45.902 --> 39:48.637
Because I would've rather
been at the leafs game

39:48.704 --> 39:51.339
with somebody else.

39:51.407 --> 39:53.341
But I don't get it.

39:53.409 --> 39:56.177
She's beautiful, she's smart,

39:56.245 --> 39:58.980
she doesn't have to pretend
to like hockey like I do.

39:59.047 --> 40:01.883
What could you possibly
not like about her?

40:01.950 --> 40:03.818
Yeah, now that
you mention it...

40:05.755 --> 40:08.790
But...

40:08.857 --> 40:11.558
She's not you.

40:13.461 --> 40:15.462
Can we try this again?

41:07.379 --> 41:10.648
Oh my God! Oh!
