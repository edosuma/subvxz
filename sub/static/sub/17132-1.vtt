WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:04.872
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE IN THE DARK?

00:04.872 --> 00:08.776
I JUST GOT MY LETTER
FROM NORTHERN VERMONT.

00:14.382 --> 00:19.253
WELL, LINDSAY, THERE IS
SOMETHING I HAVE TO ASK YOU.

00:22.890 --> 00:26.560
GEORGE, CALL ME. I JUST WENT
THROUGH MEL AND JACK'S DESK.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.497
THEY'RE MOVING
THE COMPANY TO MEXICO.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.375
(exhales deeply)

00:49.150 --> 00:51.519
ARE YOU GEORGE LOPEZ?

00:51.519 --> 00:52.953
UH, YES.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.223
WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR MOTHER.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

00:58.292 --> 01:01.162
MR. LOPEZ, IF YOU KNOW WHERE
SHE IS AND YOU DON'T TELL US,

01:01.162 --> 01:03.331
YOU'RE AN ACCOMPLICE.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.738
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

01:14.442 --> 01:17.111
* ALL MY FRIENDS

01:17.111 --> 01:18.479
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

01:20.148 --> 01:23.317
**

01:31.125 --> 01:32.960
YOU JUST WANNA
TALK TO HER?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.228
YES.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.630
OKAY. FOLLOW ME.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.832
HEY, BUT IN CASE
SHE TRIES TO RUN,

01:38.832 --> 01:42.703
DON'T BOTHER WITH
THE PEPPER SPRAY. WE'RE MEXICAN.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.741
THAT WON'T DO ANYTHING.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.378
THAT WOULD BE LIKE ME
SPRAYING YOU WITH MAYONNAISE.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.182
(officer) MA'AM.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.983
OH! OFFICER. (chuckles)

01:55.983 --> 01:58.952
I-I WAS LOOKING FOR BENNY LOPEZ.
SHE'S NOT OUT HERE.

01:58.952 --> 02:02.956
I'LL CHECK MEXICO.
MOM, RELAX.
HE JUST WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.258
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST

02:04.258 --> 02:06.594
FOR BEING AN ACCESSORY
TO AN ARMED ROBBERY.

02:06.594 --> 02:09.197
YOU LIED TO ME! SEE, THIS IS
WHY PEOPLE LIKE FIREMEN BETTER.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.998
THEY DON'T YELL "JUMP"

02:10.998 --> 02:14.235
AND THEN MOVE THE LITTLE
TRAMPOLINE THING OUT OF THE WAY.

02:14.235 --> 02:17.070
Ã³RALE! QUÃ© BRUTO!
ME ESTÃ¡S MATANDO!

02:17.070 --> 02:19.240
HEY, ENGLISH.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.109
SHE SAID YOU'RE VERY HANDSOME
AND LOVELY.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.777
CHILL OUT.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.279
GEORGE, YOU SOLD ME OUT.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.248
YOU'RE NOT MY SON ANYMORE,
GEORGE.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.951
I NEVER WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN!

02:30.951 --> 02:33.153
SO WHO'S GONNA
BAIL YOU OUT?

02:33.153 --> 02:36.357
I'LL SEE YOU ONE MORE TIME.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.366
TAKE IT EASY, MOM. I'M NOT GONNA
LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.834
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN
TO BAIL YOU OUT.
YEAH, RIGHT.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.238
THE LAST TIME YOU SAID THAT,
I SPENT A NIGHT IN JAIL.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.906
I WAS 5!

02:54.842 --> 02:57.144
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT I JUST FOUND OUT.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.913
EVERYTHING'S ABOUT YOU, ANGIE.
THEY JUST ARRESTED MY MOM.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.516
WHAT?!
I GOTTA GO DOWN
TO THE POLICE STATION.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.353
OKAY, WELL, ON YOUR WAY HOME,
PICK UP DIAPERS.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.232
I'M PREGNANT.

03:18.232 --> 03:21.101
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT I'M THE--

03:21.101 --> 03:22.470
GEORGE!

03:26.106 --> 03:30.444
OKAY, ANGIE, YOU'RE PREGNANT.
OKAY, LET'S DEAL WITH THIS.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.347
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO US?!

03:33.347 --> 03:37.217
ME? THIS ISN'T MY FAULT.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.588
"I KNOW MY BODY, GEORGE.
I KNOW WHEN I'M OVULATING."

03:40.588 --> 03:43.056
ESTÃ¡ LOCA,
"KNOW WHEN I'M OVULATING."

03:43.056 --> 03:46.560
I GOT ONE IN JAIL,
AND I GOT ONE IN THE OVEN.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.910
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
WHY THE HELL AM I STILL IN HERE?

04:05.979 --> 04:09.317
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
WHY THE HELL AM I STILL IN HERE?

04:09.317 --> 04:11.819
MOM, I WENT
TO A BAIL BONDS PLACE.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.688
THEY SAID I GOTTA PUT UP
MY HOUSE AS COLLATERAL

04:14.688 --> 04:17.024
IN CASE YOU SKIP BAIL.
AND?

04:17.024 --> 04:21.462
LET'S SEE.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.731
THAT'S PRETTY SOLID.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.534
I DIDN'T DO IT.
WHAT?!

04:26.534 --> 04:28.536
LOOK, MOM, THEY SAID
YOU'RE A FLIGHT RISK.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.304
IF YOU LEAVE,
I LOSE MY HOUSE, OKAY?

04:30.304 --> 04:32.306
I WON'T DO THAT
TO MY FAMILY.

04:32.306 --> 04:35.142
GEORGE, I SWEAR
I WON'T SKIP BAIL. OKAY?

04:35.142 --> 04:37.711
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.284
YOUR WORD? MOM, LOOK, YOU'VE
LIED TO ME MY ENTIRE LIFE.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.354
YOU TOLD ME
MY DAD WAS DEAD,

04:46.354 --> 04:48.356
THEN YOU NEVER TOLD ME
I HAD A SISTER.

04:48.356 --> 04:51.058
WHEN I WAS A KID YOU USED TO
MAKE ME DRESS UP LIKE A GIRL,

04:51.058 --> 04:52.793
SO WE COULD GET IN FREE

04:52.793 --> 04:55.496
AT MOTHER-DAUGHTER DAY
AT THE TRACK.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.398
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

04:57.398 --> 05:00.934
I STILL SIT WHEN I PEE.

05:00.934 --> 05:04.638
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
LET GO OF ALL THAT?

05:04.638 --> 05:08.008
LOOK, BAIL ME OUT,
AND I WON'T RUN.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.143
I PROMISE.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.912
THAT'S CUTE.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.915
YOU'RE CROSSING WHERE
YOUR HEART'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.851
SO YOU'RE GONNA
LET ME ROT IN JAIL

05:17.851 --> 05:20.020
FOR TWO WEEKS
BEFORE MY HEARING?

05:20.020 --> 05:22.022
MOM, I'M GONNA USE
EVERY PENNY I GOT

05:22.022 --> 05:24.358
TO GET YOU THE BEST LAWYER
I CAN, OKAY?

05:24.358 --> 05:27.561
SO YOU DON'T END UP
GOING TO PRISON.
GEORGE, IF YOU BAIL ME OUT,

05:27.561 --> 05:29.963
I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT GOING TO PRISON

05:29.963 --> 05:32.800
BECAUSE I'LL BE
IN MEXICO BY SUNUP!

05:37.671 --> 05:39.907
MOM, IF I THOUGHT
YOU'D STAY IN MEXICO,

05:39.907 --> 05:42.910
IT'D BE WORTH
LOSING MY HOUSE.

05:44.912 --> 05:45.979
TRUST ME.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.048
THE NEXT TWO WEEKS
ARE GONNA FLY BY.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.722
OOH!

05:54.722 --> 05:57.357
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
OOMPA LOOMPA.

06:00.394 --> 06:03.464
JUMP IN HER POCKET, MOM.
YOU'LL BE SAFE.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.645
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:17.645 --> 06:20.047
UH, MY HEAD HURTS.

06:20.047 --> 06:23.383
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
WORKING ON A SCIENCE PROJECT.

06:25.018 --> 06:28.689
I'M TRYING TO COME UP
WITH A CURE FOR A HANGOVER.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.757
HEY.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.059
THERE'S NO CURE
FOR A HANGOVER, MAN.

06:32.059 --> 06:35.863
YOU--YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING,
YOU GOT THAT KILLER HEADACHE.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.931
HUH? YOUR DRY HEAVES...
YOU'RE LIKE...

06:37.931 --> 06:41.034
(imitates heaving)

06:41.034 --> 06:44.204
AND THEN YOU TASTE
IN THE BACK OF YOUR THROAT

06:44.204 --> 06:46.006
LIKE A HOT DOG AT A CARNIVAL,

06:46.006 --> 06:48.341
BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER
BEING THERE. YOU'RE LIKE...

06:48.341 --> 06:49.943
(imitates heaving)
(coughs)

06:49.943 --> 06:52.813
AND THEN A LONG BABA
HANGS OUT...

06:55.082 --> 06:57.317
I GOTTA GO.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.453
LIKE THAT!

06:59.453 --> 07:02.322
GEORGE, GEORGE, GEORGE.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.892
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE OKAY.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.927
THE FACTORY'S
NOT MOVING TO MEXICO.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.096
YEAH, THE POWERS BROTHERS
LOOKED INTO IT,

07:09.096 --> 07:11.599
BUT IT TURNS OUT
THAT ALL THE SKILLED MEXICANS

07:11.599 --> 07:14.602
IN OUR INDUSTRY--
THEY'RE ALREADY HERE.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.103
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

07:16.103 --> 07:18.405
THEY WERE THINKING
ABOUT MOVING THE FACTORY.

07:18.405 --> 07:22.309
I LEFT YOU A MESSAGE!
ERNIE, I DON'T LISTEN
TO YOUR MESSAGES.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.211
WHAT? WHY NOT?

07:24.211 --> 07:27.981
DUDE, YOU CALL ME WHEN YOU SEE
A HOT GIRL ON THE FREEWAY.
YEAH?

07:27.981 --> 07:30.217
THEN YOU TAKE UP FIVE MINUTES
OF MY VOICE MAIL.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.620
(imitates Ernie)
"GEORGE, GEORGE, GEORGE!"

07:35.789 --> 07:39.092
ANY LUCK FINDING
A LAWYER FOR YOUR MOM?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.361
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE ALL
$200 AN HOUR.

07:41.361 --> 07:44.164
$200? THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.399
BENNY IS NOT GONNA GO TO JAIL

07:46.399 --> 07:49.269
FOR SOMETHING
SHE DID 30 YEARS AGO.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.872
WHAT ABOUT A PUBLIC DEFENDER?
NO WAY.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.575
WELL, WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON,

07:54.575 --> 07:56.644
WE'VE GOT
A LOT OF BILLS COMING IN.

07:56.644 --> 08:00.948
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
(can pops open)

08:00.948 --> 08:02.149
AHH.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.751
ERNIE?
HMM?

08:03.751 --> 08:07.054
DO YOU MIND GIVING US
SOME PRIVACY?
BUT I JUST OPENED THIS CAN.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.557
I MEAN, I COULD
PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE,

08:09.557 --> 08:11.825
BUT IT'S NOT
GONNA BE FIZZY LATER.

08:13.460 --> 08:16.029
OH, YOU GOT
THAT "GET OUT" LOOK.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.065
YOU NEED TO HEAR IT?
NO, I'M GOOD.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.937
LOOK, WE COVER OUR BILLS, ANGIE.
WE ALWAYS DO.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.273
YEAH,
BUT WE HAVE A NEW ONE.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.576
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO TELL YOU THIS

08:28.576 --> 08:30.944
BECAUSE YOU WERE DEALING
WITH YOUR MOM,

08:30.944 --> 08:32.946
BUT CARMEN GOT INTO COLLEGE.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.315
CARMEN GOT ACCEPTED?
THAT'S GREAT!

08:35.315 --> 08:36.984
YES. OUR LITTLE GIRL

08:36.984 --> 08:40.053
IS GONNA BE THE FIRST LOPEZ
TO GO TO COLLEGE...

08:40.053 --> 08:41.488
(sniffs) AHEM.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.256
FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.261
THANK YOU.

08:48.261 --> 08:51.565
AND ON TOP OF THAT, WE HAVE
ALL THE EXPENSES WITH THE BABY.

08:51.565 --> 08:54.702
LOOK, ANGIE, THIS IS CRAZY.

08:54.702 --> 08:58.806
WE--WE CAN'T HANDLE
ANOTHER KID AT OUR AGE.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.041
WHAT ABOUT ADOPTION?

09:01.041 --> 09:04.111
I AM NOT GIVING UP
THIS BABY.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.546
I'M TALKING ABOUT MAX.

09:08.916 --> 09:13.186
HE SMELLS FUNKY, YOU KNOW,
AND HE SLEEPS TILL NOON.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.924
I DON'T SEE WHAT WE'RE GETTING
OUT OF THE DEAL.

09:16.924 --> 09:20.127
I'M JUST WORRIED THAT
OUR BILLS ARE GONNA BURY US.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.929
DON'T WORRY ALL RIGHT?
I GOT A PLAN.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.864
WE'RE GONNA GET MY MOM
A GREAT LAWYER

09:23.864 --> 09:25.866
AND DEAL WITH THE REST
OF THE BILLS LATER.

09:25.866 --> 09:30.170
THAT'S NOT A PLAN.
I DIDN'T FINISH!

09:30.170 --> 09:32.773
THEN WE'RE GONNA
PLAY THE LOTTERY, RIGHT?

09:34.307 --> 09:38.045
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA INVENT
SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE NEEDS,

09:38.045 --> 09:43.350
L-L-L-L-LIKE SOCKS THAT HAVE
SANDPAPER AT THE END.

09:43.350 --> 09:47.354
SO THAT WAY, WHEN YOU WALK,
YOU TRIM YOUR TOENAILS.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.058
THERE MIGHT BE
A BLEEDING ISSUE,

09:51.058 --> 09:54.327
BUT THIS IS JUST
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.933
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT DRESSED?
MY MOM'S HEARING'S IN AN HOUR.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.035
TELL HER I'M SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T MAKE IT.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.371
(voice breaking) I HAVE
TO HELP CARMEN FINISH PACKING.

10:04.371 --> 10:08.008
I CAN'T BELIEVE OUR BABY'S
LEAVING FOR COLLEGE TODAY.

10:08.008 --> 10:11.144
SHE JUST GOT ACCEPTED
TWO WEEKS AGO.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.580
COME ON.
LOOK, SHE GOT A JOB ON CAMPUS.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.883
ANGIE, THIS IS A GOOD THING.

10:15.883 --> 10:19.352
WE FED THIS BABY BIRD
FOR 18 YEARS,

10:19.352 --> 10:25.192
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO NUDGE...

10:25.192 --> 10:26.827
HER OUT OF THE NEST.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.763
SHE'LL EITHER FLY
OR SHE'LL LAND IN THE YARD,

10:29.763 --> 10:31.832
AND THE NEIGHBOR'S CAT
WILL EAT HALF HER BODY.

10:31.832 --> 10:35.335
GREAT NEWS.
LINDSAY FINALLY SAID YES.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.204
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!

10:37.204 --> 10:38.772
OH.
OY.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.474
COME ON. CONGRATULATE ME.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.844
DADDY, CARMEN IS
LEAVING TODAY FOR COLLEGE.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.946
GEORGE HAS TO GO
TO HIS MOTHER'S HEARING.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.815
WE'VE GOT OTHER THINGS
ON OUR MINDS.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.850
YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.584
YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THE FACT

10:51.584 --> 10:54.688
THAT I'M MARRYING
A WOMAN WHO'S ONLY 27. (scoffs)

10:57.057 --> 10:59.960
I CAN ACCEPT THAT SHE'S 27.
VIC, WHAT I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT,

10:59.960 --> 11:03.163
DUDE, IS THAT,
IS SHE REALLY A WOMAN?

11:05.733 --> 11:09.669
WHEN YOU ASKED HER TO MARRY YOU,
DID SHE LOOK IN YOUR EYES

11:09.669 --> 11:11.972
AND SAY...
(deep voice) "I WILL."

11:11.972 --> 11:15.375
CAN YOU COME HOME AS SOON
AS THE HEARING'S OVER?

11:15.375 --> 11:17.711
CARMEN REALLY WANTS YOU
TO COME TO THE AIRPORT.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.279
I'LL BE THERE.

11:19.279 --> 11:24.084
SO, UH, I GUESS CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER FOR YOU.

11:24.084 --> 11:28.055
LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW IF
MY MOM'S GOING TO PRISON YET.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.992
NO!

11:31.992 --> 11:34.527
I HEARD YOU'RE HAVING
A BABY.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.864
OH, YEAH.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.799
YOU DON'T SOUND
TOO EXCITED.

11:38.799 --> 11:42.002
I'M NOT. LOOK, I THOUGHT
I WAS DONE RAISING KIDS,

11:42.002 --> 11:44.004
BUT WHAT CAN I DO?
WAIT.

11:44.004 --> 11:47.607
THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I NEED TO SAY TO YOU, SON,

11:47.607 --> 11:49.409
AND IT'S SOMETHING
THAT HELPS ME

11:49.409 --> 11:53.480
WHENEVER I'M FACING
TOUGH TIMES. HMM?

11:53.480 --> 11:56.149
I'M MARRYING A 27 YEAR OLD!

12:00.053 --> 12:02.355
THAT'S GREAT, VIC.
YOU KNOW, IN TEN YEARS

12:02.355 --> 12:05.058
WHEN SHE GOES
TO HER HIGH SCHOOL REUNION,

12:05.058 --> 12:07.194
SHE CAN TAKE YOUR ASHES.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.165
(deep voice)
"THAT'S NOT AN ASHTRAY.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.802
YOU JUST SPIT YOUR GUM
IN MY HUSBAND."

12:20.607 --> 12:23.777
WHERE'S THE JUDGE, MAN? I GOTTA
TAKE MY DAUGHTER TO THE AIRPORT.

12:23.777 --> 12:27.114
OH, IT'LL BE A WHILE, GEORGE.
THE JUDGE IS RUNNING LATE.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.083
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT PAYING YOU
TILL THE JUDGE GETS HERE.

12:30.083 --> 12:34.587
SORRY, OLD CHUM, BUT IF I'M
IN THE COURT, I'M ON THE CLOCK.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.891
WELL, IF I'M PAYING YOU,
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO WORK.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.827
EH, GET ME SOME COFFEE.

12:41.128 --> 12:44.397
I'VE NEVER FETCHED COFFEE
FOR A CLIENT BEFORE.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.999
THEN AGAIN,

12:45.999 --> 12:49.402
I'VE NEVER HAD A CLIENT
AGREE TO PAY ME $200 AN HOUR.

12:49.402 --> 12:52.239
WOULD YOU LIKE CREAM?

12:53.941 --> 12:56.476
MOM.
NARC.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.415
ALL RIGHT, IF WE'RE GONNA GET
THIS THING THROWN OUT,

13:02.415 --> 13:05.218
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A GOOD IMPRESSION ON THE JUDGE,

13:05.218 --> 13:07.654
SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOURSELF,

13:07.654 --> 13:12.492
ACCENTUATE THE QUALITIES
THAT MAKE YOU LOOK SYMPATHETIC.

13:12.492 --> 13:16.796
SHE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE.
STICK TO THE FACTS, MOM.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.499
THE FACTS ARE GONNA
GET ME SENT TO JAIL.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.468
FACTS ARE SUBJECTIVE.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.904
LAST NIGHT I HAD
A ROMANTIC LIAISON

13:23.904 --> 13:26.473
WITH MY SECRETARY
IN THE OFFICE.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.075
MY WIFE CALLED.

13:28.075 --> 13:32.245
I TOLD HER I COULDN'T
COME HOME BECAUSE...

13:32.245 --> 13:37.017
I HAD SOMETHING ON MY DESK
THAT NEEDED MY ATTENTION.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.586
NOW DID I LIE?

13:46.726 --> 13:49.162
COCHINO, YEAH, YOU LIED.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.301
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
LOOK, MOM,
DON'T DO THIS, OKAY?

13:54.301 --> 13:57.237
IF YOU GET CAUGHT LYING,
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THIS WORSE.

13:57.237 --> 14:02.342
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, GEORGE.
LYING NEVER WORKS.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.745
YOU'RE THE SMARTEST GUY
I KNOW.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.548
(man) ALL RISE.

14:08.548 --> 14:12.920
SORRY I'M LATE. BE SEATED.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.256
OKAY, LET'S GET STARTED.
WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE

14:16.256 --> 14:18.458
IF THE UNITED STATES
vs. BENITA LOPEZ

14:18.458 --> 14:19.726
WILL BE GOING TO TRIAL.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.929
I'LL HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES.
IS THE DEFENDANT PRESENT?

14:21.929 --> 14:24.297
HERE, YOUR HONOR.
OKAY, MS. LOPEZ,

14:24.297 --> 14:27.200
NOW WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT
HAPPENED ON THE DAY IN QUESTION

14:27.200 --> 14:29.502
WHEN THE CONVENIENCE STORE
WAS ROBBED?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.571
WELL...

14:31.571 --> 14:35.208
IT STARTED OUT
LIKE ANY OTHER DAY.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.978
I WAS ON MY WAY TO CHURCH...

14:40.080 --> 14:44.484
FROM, UM,
FROM THE SOUP KITCHEN...

14:44.484 --> 14:49.923
BEFORE I STARTED MY SHIFT
AT THE BRAILLE INSTITUTE.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.758
OH, QUE LA!

14:51.758 --> 14:55.028
YOUR HONOR, I DEMAND
THAT THIS CASE BE THROWN OUT!

14:55.028 --> 14:56.629
ON WHAT GROUNDS?

15:00.000 --> 15:05.005
DUE TO MY MOM'S
SEXUAL HISTORY...

15:05.005 --> 15:06.806
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER

15:06.806 --> 15:10.010
TO GET A FAIR TRIAL
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

15:10.010 --> 15:13.413
THE JURY POOL IS TAINTED.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.418
AND A LOT OF DUDES
ARE ON ANTIBIOTICS.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.788
THERE'S NO JURY HERE.
THIS IS MY CALL,

15:21.788 --> 15:24.992
AND BESIDES, WHO ARE YOU?
ARE YOU ACTING AS HER ATTORNEY?

15:24.992 --> 15:28.028
UH, NO. UM...
(clears throat)

15:28.028 --> 15:30.463
I'M HER SON. HELLO.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.632
WELL, GO HAVE A SEAT, SON,
AND DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD,

15:32.632 --> 15:36.336
OR I'LL HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT!

15:36.336 --> 15:39.939
YES, YOUR HONOR.
I CAN NEVER DO NOTHING IN COURT!

15:39.939 --> 15:42.976
YOU'D BE LUCKY TO HOLD ME
BECAUSE I GET TOUGH WHENEVER...

15:42.976 --> 15:45.578
I'M A HUMAN BEING.
(speaking indistinctly)

15:45.578 --> 15:48.048
SIT DOWN!

15:50.917 --> 15:52.652
HATE HER.

15:59.426 --> 16:03.263
HEY. I KNOW YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR
GEORGE, BUT WE HAVE TO GET GOING

16:03.263 --> 16:06.166
IF CARMEN'S GOING
TO MAKE HER FLIGHT.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.501
WHAT IS IT?

16:08.501 --> 16:12.372
I GOT MY PERIOD.
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

16:12.372 --> 16:15.542
I GUESS THE TEST
WAS A FALSE POSITIVE.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.911
WELL,
THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.781
OH, PRINCESS.
I'M SO SORRY.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.217
GEORGE IS GONNA BE
RELIEVED.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.287
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

16:27.287 --> 16:28.521
OH.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.691
IT'S FUNNY.
I WASN'T SURE HOW I FELT.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.094
IT WAS SO UNPLANNED.

16:34.094 --> 16:37.764
BUT NOW...

16:37.764 --> 16:39.599
I'M A LITTLE SAD.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.302
REMEMBER HOW
I USED TO CHEER YOU UP

16:42.302 --> 16:45.272
WHEN YOU WERE
A LITTLE GIRL?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.641
I DON'T THINK
THE TICKLE MONSTER'S

16:48.641 --> 16:51.311
GONNA HELP ME RIGHT NOW.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.447
PROBABLY NOT,
BUT REMEMBER,

16:54.447 --> 16:56.449
THE THING
ABOUT TICKLE MONSTERS

16:56.449 --> 16:59.519
IS THAT YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
THEY'RE GOING TO ATTACK!

16:59.519 --> 17:03.123
(laughs) OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
THANK YOU, DADDY.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.491
YOU CAN STOP NOW.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.327
I KNOW,
YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR THIS...

17:07.327 --> 17:11.564
(sighs) BUT AGE MEANS NOTHING
TO THE TICKLE MONSTER!

17:11.564 --> 17:15.602
STOP. (laughing)

17:18.938 --> 17:20.507
THE TRUTH IS, YOUR HONOR,

17:20.507 --> 17:23.210
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ME
IN THE CAR

17:23.210 --> 17:25.678
AT THE CONVENIENCE STORE.

17:25.678 --> 17:30.183
I, UH, WAS BUSY DONATING
BONE MARROW TO A STRANGER.

17:33.286 --> 17:36.523
THANK YOU, MISS LOPEZ.
HAVE A SEAT.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.659
DOES THE PROSECUTION HAVE
ANYTHING THEY WISH TO SAY?

17:41.828 --> 17:43.930
YEAH.

17:43.930 --> 17:48.168
WE HAVE A VIDEOTAPE FROM
THE PARKING LOT SECURITY CAMERA

17:48.168 --> 17:51.304
OF THE DEFENDANT
DRIVING THE GETAWAY CAR.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.208
WE HAVE BLOWN UP THE TAPE,

17:55.208 --> 17:57.210
AND YOU CAN SEE HER LAUGHING

17:57.210 --> 18:01.748
AND STUFFING MONEY
INTO HER BRA.

18:07.987 --> 18:14.661
ALSO, SHE WAS WEARING THE SAME
SHIRT SHE IS WEARING... NOW.

18:19.499 --> 18:23.870
TRIAL IS SET
FOR THREE WEEKS FROM TODAY.

18:28.208 --> 18:31.110
ANGIE, I'M HERE.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.745
CARMEN?

18:43.990 --> 18:46.559
THEY COULDN'T WAIT ANYMORE.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.196
MOM HAD TO TAKE CARMEN
TO THE AIRPORT.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.099
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED HER.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.568
SINCE YOU'LL PROBABLY MISS IT
WHEN I GO TO COLLEGE,

18:55.568 --> 18:57.637
WANNA SAY GOOD-BYE
TO ME NOW?

18:57.637 --> 19:00.673
COLLEGE? DUDE,
I'VE SEEN YOUR REPORT CARD.

19:00.673 --> 19:05.545
YOU'RE GONNA LIVE
ABOVE THE GARAGE LIKE FONZIE.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.932
WHERE WERE YOU?

19:59.932 --> 20:04.170
I GOT HELD UP IN COURT.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.506
ARE YOU OKAY?

20:06.506 --> 20:08.140
ANGIE?

20:08.140 --> 20:10.710
YEAH, HONEY?

20:12.512 --> 20:15.782
I'M REALLY GLAD
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS BABY.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.884
REALLY?

20:21.120 --> 20:22.989
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.926
BECAUSE...

20:26.926 --> 20:29.462
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE RELIEVED

20:29.462 --> 20:32.231
IF YOU FOUND OUT
WE WEREN'T HAVING THIS BABY.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.966
NO.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.635
NO, LOOK...

20:35.635 --> 20:41.774
I DIDN'T KNOW CARMEN'S LEAVING
WOULD HIT ME LIKE THIS.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.477
THE BABY'S THE ONE THING WE GOT
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

20:44.477 --> 20:48.147
SO YOU'RE READY
TO RAISE ANOTHER KID?

20:48.147 --> 20:50.283
YEAH. AREN'T YOU?

20:50.283 --> 20:54.921
YEAH. I'D LIKE THAT.

20:54.921 --> 20:59.659
GONNA SEE YOU IN NINE MONTHS,
LITTLE LOPEZ.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.761
OR MAYBE
10 OR 11 MONTHS.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.996
IT DEPENDS
ON THE DATE OF CONCEPTION,

21:03.996 --> 21:06.499
SO DON'T START COUNTING WEEKS
OR ANYTHING.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.935
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.136
NOTHING. HORMONES.

21:10.136 --> 21:16.042
SO I FORGOT TO ASK.
WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOUR MOM?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.009
OH. SHE'S GOING TO TRIAL.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.345
OH.

21:18.345 --> 21:21.047
(singsong voice)
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET OUT

21:21.047 --> 21:23.683
BEFORE YOUR GRANDMA DOES.
