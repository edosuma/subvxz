WEBVTT

00:45.587 --> 00:48.131
Assemble at Braila. Await the word.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.967
My work here is almost done.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.721
Nothing here but lost children
and confused old men.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.932
The end of this
will be practically merciful.

01:05.815 --> 01:10.070
Really? How hard can it be
to find Godbrand of all people?

01:10.612 --> 01:13.156
There has to be a limited number
of things in this castle

01:13.239 --> 01:16.034
that he can drink, sleep under,
or attempt to have sex with.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.369
He must be somewhere.

01:54.155 --> 01:57.700
You know, for coming from an oral,
memory-based culture,

01:58.368 --> 01:59.661
you're very good with books.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.996
It would have been a poor education

02:02.080 --> 02:05.125
if we hadn't been taught to read things
to add to our memory stores.

02:09.129 --> 02:14.008
But I am coming to the conclusion
that my people are idiots.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.303
-We should have written everything down.
-Everything?

02:18.012 --> 02:19.389
Yes. All the things.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.475
Look at this. There's more in this room

02:22.559 --> 02:25.687
than a million Speakers could carry
across two generations.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.564
This is insane.

02:27.647 --> 02:31.442
The sheer breadth of information
about the castle is staggering.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.114
But how much of it is useful?

02:37.115 --> 02:40.827
Well, I do have questions
about Trevor's ancestors.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.415
I discovered an entire box of spells
about... penises.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.168
You're certain it was one of
his ancestors?

02:49.752 --> 02:52.046
You didn't find it
under his childhood bed?

02:52.463 --> 02:54.048
Stop testing him, Alucard.

02:56.634 --> 03:00.430
I am concerned I have thrown my lot in
with a demented infant.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.433
I imagine he has similar concerns
about you.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.770
I am also concerned
that you enjoy him too much.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.732
And what is that supposed to mean?

03:11.149 --> 03:13.651
He is unreliable, emotionally damaged,

03:14.402 --> 03:18.281
and distracting to you while you should be
focused on the task at hand.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.285
Am I not working hard enough?

03:27.790 --> 03:29.959
He's a drunk and he's self-destructive.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.338
Anybody trying to hold on to him
may be dragged down with him.

03:34.297 --> 03:38.301
You're afraid. You worry that you
might have made the wrong choice.

03:38.384 --> 03:42.305
So, you're trying to make him prove
himself by constantly provoking him.

03:44.015 --> 03:47.936
You forget, Alucard, Trevor didn't get to
finish out his childhood.

03:48.811 --> 03:51.105
He is not the man here
who may not have grown up.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.942
Well, that's ridiculous.

03:54.734 --> 03:58.363
And if we don't get this done,
then we're all failing.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.114
Aren't we?

04:01.491 --> 04:02.408
We can't fail.

04:08.498 --> 04:12.835
Wait. Get me that volume back there,
with the red spine.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.422
-What have you found?
-I'm not sure.

04:17.131 --> 04:19.217
The ritual language it's written in

04:19.300 --> 04:21.386
has forked a couple of times
over the years.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.430
-Can you read it?
-Not without that book.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.017
It's based on Adamic.
I recognize the roots.

04:28.935 --> 04:32.647
That book there claimed to be written
in a language called High Remembrance.

04:32.730 --> 04:33.773
which I've heard of.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.944
This one has the Adamical roots and
some of the structure of High Remembrance.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.655
-Give.
-I haven't heard of Adamic.

04:40.738 --> 04:41.572
Take a look.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.451
Interesting.

04:45.535 --> 04:49.622
-I see threads of Chaldaic in it.
-You're rather well-read yourself.

04:50.873 --> 04:54.752
I had entirely different books under my
childhood bed. My father was a polymath,

04:54.836 --> 04:57.880
my mother was a doctor,
and I grew up very fast.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.174
What does that mean?

05:01.801 --> 05:04.429
I'm being literal. I aged very quickly.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.807
That may explain something.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.475
What?

05:09.726 --> 05:13.062
Perhaps you're just an angry teenager
in an adult's body.

05:35.209 --> 05:39.005
You can spend so long in the castle
you forget how the sun feels.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.009
-Don't you think?
-I like the castle.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.554
The stone stays cool
no matter where we are.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.181
You like the cold?

05:48.639 --> 05:51.559
When I'm cold I can eat meat
or throw a cloak on.

05:52.101 --> 05:56.522
I spent my whole life in hot places.
You can't escape heat.

05:57.440 --> 06:01.652
Keep walking. Vampires have sharp ears,
and you said we needed to talk.

06:02.153 --> 06:06.324
-You're concerned about them hearing us?
-I'm not a fool, Hector.

06:07.366 --> 06:12.080
If you weren't concerned, you wouldn't
want the conversation out in the daylight.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.749
I just didn't want to be interrupted
by argument.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.959
They are good at arguing.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.545
I used to liken them to wolves or bats.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.882
A strong sense of community,
acting as one.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.595
But lately... I see the vampires as cats.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.348
Swiping, hunting or ignoring each other.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.935
-You think of vampires as animals?
-In a way.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.396
They are pure creatures. They have grace.

06:38.314 --> 06:42.610
-Animals don't act with malice.
-Cats play with their food all the time.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.863
True. But it's not malicious.
There's joy in it.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.615
Not for the food.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.585
So?

07:01.504 --> 07:03.256
The cats need herding, Isaac.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.509
That's a good way
to get your eyes clawed out, Hector.

07:07.135 --> 07:11.097
I mean it. Dracula gave us the task
of creating a war plan.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.892
But between his generals, their fighting,
and his own attitude...

07:15.560 --> 07:18.521
-And what attitude is that?
-He doesn't care.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.690
He cares very much.

07:21.190 --> 07:24.819
He wants all of the humans to die.
He's quite clear on that.

07:25.445 --> 07:29.198
That hasn't escaped me.
My point is that he doesn't care how.

07:30.992 --> 07:31.993
And we're failing him.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.038
-Are we, now?
-Yes.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.374
We need to assert an order to the war.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.294
We're the agents of his rage,
not paintings of it.

07:41.669 --> 07:45.339
-We can't just thrash around.
-What do you want, Hector?

07:46.883 --> 07:48.468
I want to present a united front.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.262
I want a plan.

07:52.388 --> 07:55.725
I want to move forward,
get this over with in an orderly manner.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.895
I want you to agree to move on Braila.

08:01.689 --> 08:05.067
I know that, strictly speaking,
we've never been friends.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.905
It seems counterproductive
to cultivate human friends

08:08.988 --> 08:12.074
when we're engaged in the project
of ending the human race.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.368
But we are on the same side.

08:15.786 --> 08:18.331
Is this where we kiss like
Benedictine monks

08:18.414 --> 08:20.082
from different monasteries?

08:20.708 --> 08:23.503
I don't think I've heard you
tell a joke before.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.670
You still haven't.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.676
All Dracula hears is the noise
in the War Hall.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.430
He needs us to be the clear voice
over that noise.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.434
-He needs us to speak in one voice.
-He needs us to be loyal.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.812
How is it disloyal to provide the guidance
he requested?

08:42.438 --> 08:44.440
If it's serving you and not him.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.985
There are people in the court
who have their own plans,

08:48.069 --> 08:49.445
their own agendas.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.989
I am loyal to him and his intent.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.367
But he asked for a plan.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.036
We need to give him one, unambiguously.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.624
We go to Braila,
prevent a diaspora by boat,

09:01.707 --> 09:03.668
and then proceed along the coast.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.296
-What do you say?
-Well...

09:08.339 --> 09:10.925
it will please Carmilla, so I distrust it.

09:11.842 --> 09:16.472
But... it would stop her from
making mischief for the moment.

09:17.348 --> 09:21.102
And it would get the war room pointed
in the same direction.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.066
I imagine it would even make
Godbrand smile.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.903
Yeah, well, don't talk me out of it.

09:40.496 --> 09:41.330
Isaac agreed.

09:42.206 --> 09:45.293
That's good. That's very good.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.630
And the night creatures will arrive
at their destination soon.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.384
Hector, you are a marvel.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.304
What now?

09:56.846 --> 09:59.807
Now we'll wait a short while
for Isaac to settle.

10:00.182 --> 10:04.854
And then we'll have him accompany us
to Dracula, present a united front.

10:05.730 --> 10:10.443
Dracula will have no choice but to agree
to the request of both his forgemasters.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.361
Brilliant, Hector.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.575
A quick, orderly, and merciful war.

10:19.035 --> 10:23.205
Just as you wished, Hector.
You have caused this to happen.

10:23.914 --> 10:24.874
Be proud.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.793
I admire your resolve.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.510
Quite remarkable.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.930
-Carpathian?
-Indeed.

10:41.015 --> 10:44.894
The last of the mirrors made
by the Carpathian scrying hermits,

10:44.977 --> 10:46.270
400 years ago.

10:46.979 --> 10:50.066
I must learn more about
transmission mirrors one day.

10:50.733 --> 10:54.403
There will be time enough.
Soon the world will be silent.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.280
God, yes.

10:57.114 --> 11:01.202
Listening to Hector made me wish
for a lifeless world all on his own.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.624
I find myself wishing
you two were better friends.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.292
As I said to him,

11:08.918 --> 11:11.587
making human friends
seems a little pointless,

11:11.837 --> 11:13.381
given our current crusade.

11:14.131 --> 11:19.220
True. But at the end,
there will be only you and him.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.305
Presumably.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.726
He'll be coming here
to request you approve a move on Braila.

11:26.811 --> 11:27.645
Why?

11:28.020 --> 11:30.689
Hector doesn't like it
when the animals fight.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.527
Carmilla has the court whipped up.
Discord is loud.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.153
It bothers him.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.239
Is he still loyal?

11:39.198 --> 11:40.533
Oh, I think so.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.536
There's betrayal abroad in the court,

11:43.619 --> 11:46.122
but Hector is a simpler creature
than that.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.374
He doesn't like the arguing.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.378
-So, the generals are going to betray me?
-No.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.631
If anyone approached the verge of that,

11:55.714 --> 11:58.968
they would be taken care of
without you finding out about it, my lord.

11:59.677 --> 12:02.763
It is simply in the air,
because they are frustrated.

12:03.305 --> 12:07.601
So, if I let them go to Braila,
they'll stop scheming and whining?

12:08.394 --> 12:09.228
I think so.

12:09.854 --> 12:13.399
It will give Carmilla some power,
but that's not a bad thing.

12:13.941 --> 12:14.775
No.

12:15.484 --> 12:19.905
The war room will speak to you and
Hector in one voice instead of a dozen.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.532
Indeed.

12:22.324 --> 12:25.703
And, at the end of the day,
you don't care.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.622
So long as the war continues.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.294
Fine, then.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.838
I'm tired, Isaac.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.342
There was a time
that I would relish the details.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.512
Oh, there was a time...

12:45.556 --> 12:50.144
A time when the smallest details
of death delighted me.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.649
I remember when the merchants
of Kronstadt disrespected me.

12:57.776 --> 13:02.198
Spending a delicious few days
gathering information about the town

13:02.781 --> 13:04.408
and drawing my plans,

13:05.117 --> 13:06.994
stealing up the river at night,

13:07.786 --> 13:09.497
setting fires in the town,

13:09.580 --> 13:14.126
knowing that the merchantmen
would send their wives and children out...

13:17.338 --> 13:19.882
but go to retrieve
their most valuable goods

13:19.965 --> 13:21.592
before making their escape.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.917
Forty of them had offended me.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.379
At the time, I saw no reason
to harm anybody other than those 40.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.052
And I painted my picture accordingly.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.986
But those times are long gone.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.655
Let us just conclude this thing.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.332
Isaac.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.876
We were looking for you.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.837
I was admiring the mirror.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.924
My lord Dracula.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.094
-My lord.
-Yes, yes, we all know who we are.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.637
What do you all want?

16:55.681 --> 16:57.307
Very well. Hector?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.854
We would ask you to consider
moving the castle to Braila,

17:01.937 --> 17:05.149
to conduct a full-scale
destructive attack on the port.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.692
To what end?

17:07.109 --> 17:10.529
To seal it, and discourage escape
by river to the sea.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.282
Then we turn inland,
having land-locked the humans

17:13.365 --> 17:15.701
and turned their country into a prison.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.580
I agree. They make a good case.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.291
It unites the court.
It lets us move forward.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.669
Braila, fine. Braila it is.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.131
I no longer have the strength
for these decisions.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.925
Amuse yourselves.
We'll go to Braila ourselves

17:32.009 --> 17:34.428
so long as they all die.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.099
That's all that matters.
They all have to die.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.479
Thank you.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.815
-A great victory awaits.
-Yes, yes.

17:47.816 --> 17:48.692
I'm tired.

17:49.777 --> 17:53.322
Tell me when you're ready for me to move
the castle to Braila. Get on with it.

18:01.914 --> 18:06.085
I will stay, Dracula, until this is done.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.295
It doesn't matter.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.883
So long as they all die. That's all.

18:14.676 --> 18:15.969
They all have to die.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.351
What now?

18:22.643 --> 18:25.104
Now I ensure my forces will be in place.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.523
Then we inform the war council
and convince them

18:27.606 --> 18:30.150
that this was their plan all along.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.861
Some will wonder
why this is where your interest is,

18:33.362 --> 18:36.698
after you so loudly brought up the issue
of Belmont and Alucard.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.743
I have already had you forge me
the means to deal with that issue.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.579
I am in control, Hector.

18:43.080 --> 18:43.914
You are?

18:46.792 --> 18:50.462
Yes. He could have done it.
You could have done it.

18:50.546 --> 18:53.215
Any of the generals could have done it.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.925
But I had to.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.886
Do you know why I had to do it?

18:58.428 --> 19:02.641
Because I am surrounded by children
and animals and dying old men.

19:02.975 --> 19:07.479
There are four other women in this castle,
and they all glare from the edges,

19:07.563 --> 19:10.315
either disempowered
by posturing man-children

19:10.399 --> 19:13.610
or too paralyzed by sheer fucking rage
to do anything.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.946
And which am I, child or animal?

19:16.738 --> 19:19.616
Puppy. Somewhere between the two.

19:20.617 --> 19:23.120
I thought you wanted me to believe
you respected me.

19:23.203 --> 19:27.207
I did.
Now you're implicated, so I don't need to.

19:27.749 --> 19:31.837
You're hip-deep in this now, puppy,
and the only way out is forward.

19:32.462 --> 19:33.547
Come along.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.703
This is-- Trevor!

20:05.787 --> 20:07.748
-What?
-I have something.

20:08.332 --> 20:12.211
When I say what, that doesn't mean
I'd like to ask more questions.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.589
Would you please--?
Oh, you are the most annoying--

20:15.672 --> 20:16.757
Just stop.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.344
I'm coming up.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.513
I think I've found a locking spell.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.057
Wait, listen.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.143
Your family have an entire literature here
about the castle.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.313
They tried for centuries to eliminate
its main advantage.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.107
It transports itself
through magical means.

20:34.524 --> 20:38.862
Right. So you can't attack it
if it just jumps somewhere else.

20:39.279 --> 20:44.284
Yes. So, some clever Belmont eventually
formulated most of a locking spell.

20:44.368 --> 20:48.205
A method to catch the castle
and lock it down to a single location

20:48.288 --> 20:49.831
so that it can be invaded.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.416
Most of it.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.169
I can finish the final clauses
of it myself.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.713
It's all based on Adamical structures.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.715
You keep saying that word.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.427
Adamic is the original human language,

21:02.511 --> 21:05.347
the one spoken by Adam and Eve
in the Garden of Eden.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.141
The one that was split
into all other languages

21:08.225 --> 21:11.603
at the Tower of Babel by God
to prevent human cooperation.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.984
Is that how you understand that story?

21:17.609 --> 21:20.696
Oh, yes.
The Speakers are the enemy of God.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.824
We live in cooperation
and hide our stories inside ourselves

21:23.907 --> 21:26.118
so he cannot strike them down in jealousy.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.375
See? God hates me.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.097
That's probably not God.
