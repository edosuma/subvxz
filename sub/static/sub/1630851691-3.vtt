(dramatic music)

00:02.569 --> 00:03.968
Rosella:
<i> That is the last time</i>

00:04.005 --> 00:06.972
<i> I order indian food</i>
<i> at a non-indian spot.</i>

00:07.107 --> 00:09.874
Aisha:
<i>Girl, you don't go to a baseball</i>
<i> game to see a touchdown.</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:13.912
Man 1:
<i> Hey, you think you</i>
<i> can stiff the waitress,</i>

00:14.048 --> 00:15.781
Walk right out,
no consequences?

00:17.051 --> 00:18.116
Rosella:
<i> How 'bout you mind</i>
<i> your own business?</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:20.185
Man 2:
<i> Not paying your</i>
<i> bill is a crime.</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:21.186
Screw you!

00:21.321 --> 00:22.621
Watch your mouth, bitch!

00:23.424 --> 00:24.523
Percy:<i> Hey, hey!</i>
-Hey.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.792
Back off!

00:26.794 --> 00:28.193
Fellas, let's just go.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.795
Well look who's here
to save the day.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.864
Look, it's late,

00:31.866 --> 00:33.866
It seems like you guys
had a lot to drink,

00:35.202 --> 00:36.401
I think everyone
should go home.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.402
Does it also look like

00:37.405 --> 00:39.370
You're talking to
three police officers?

00:42.209 --> 00:43.642
Show your badges.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.976
Is that a command?

00:46.013 --> 00:48.514
(dramatic music)

00:48.649 --> 00:50.049
(men grunting)

00:50.184 --> 00:51.884
(women gasping)

00:52.019 --> 00:53.351
Oh my god! Stop!

00:53.854 --> 00:54.753
Oh my god!

00:54.888 --> 00:56.655
(men grunting)

00:56.790 --> 00:58.323
Enough, let's go.

00:59.626 --> 01:01.025
Man 2:
<i> Show 'em how</i>
<i> it's done, kyle.</i>

01:01.062 --> 01:02.427
Man 1:
<i> Stop resisting.</i>

01:03.097 --> 01:03.995
Man 3:
<i> Let's go!</i>

01:04.031 --> 01:05.063
Man 1:
<i> Yeah, not so tough now, huh?</i>

01:05.132 --> 01:06.131
Rosella:
<i> Stop it, please.</i>

01:06.266 --> 01:07.299
Man 3:
<i> Fellas, let's go!</i>

01:07.434 --> 01:08.533
Rosella:
<i> Stop him!</i>

01:08.602 --> 01:09.635
Man 3:
<i> Boys!</i>

01:09.770 --> 01:11.103
(percy gasps)
(woman wails)

01:11.238 --> 01:12.771
(dramatic music)

01:12.773 --> 01:15.073
Rosella:
(echoing)<i> why are you</i>
<i> doing these things?</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:16.040
Man 3:
(echoing)<i> enough!</i>

01:16.077 --> 01:17.442
Rosella:
(echoing)<i> stop, please!</i>

01:17.445 --> 01:18.443
Man 2:
(echoing)<i> don't mess with us!</i>

01:18.446 --> 01:19.511
Oh my god!

01:19.513 --> 01:20.712
Man 3:
<i> Boys!</i>

01:22.349 --> 01:23.515
<i> Enough!</i>

01:25.486 --> 01:26.985
<i> He's had enough!</i>

01:28.089 --> 01:30.455
(flesh slashing)

01:30.524 --> 01:31.523
Kyle:
<i> No!</i>

01:31.525 --> 01:34.793
(kyle grunting)
(flesh slashing)

01:34.862 --> 01:39.865
(percy gasping)

01:39.867 --> 01:40.932
Percy:
(breathless)<i> I'm okay.</i>

01:41.001 --> 01:42.233
It's okay.

01:42.703 --> 01:43.735
It's okay.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.604
Man 2:
<i> No, kyle!</i>

01:45.673 --> 01:47.005
Percy:
<i> I'm okay.</i>

01:47.141 --> 01:51.076
(dramatic music)

01:51.211 --> 01:52.544
Man 2:
<i> We got the ambulance</i>
<i> is coming.</i>

01:52.613 --> 01:55.013
(distant sirens wail)

01:55.015 --> 02:03.221
(tense music)
(sirens wail)

02:03.357 --> 02:09.227
(sirens wail)
(people chattering)

02:19.640 --> 02:21.306
Colleen:
<i> At least they decided to</i>
<i> charge him with manslaughter</i>

02:21.342 --> 02:22.241
Not murder.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.441
Of course, colleen.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.442
He acted in self-defence.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.877
Well...

02:25.913 --> 02:27.646
<i> The two women that he tried</i>
<i> to help will testify to that.</i>

02:27.781 --> 02:30.082
Not everybody's happy hla
is repping percy lincoln

02:30.084 --> 02:31.216
For killing a cop.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.151
<i> Joyce, the acting chair,</i>

02:32.286 --> 02:33.851
Calls me every
hour on the hour.

02:33.888 --> 02:35.821
Marcie:
<i> And the fact that he's</i>
<i> family doesn't matter to them?</i>

02:35.823 --> 02:39.224
Was. It's not just
the board though.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.326
Some of your clients are
asking to be reassigned.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.460
Seriously?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.528
Colleen:
<i> They think because</i>
<i> you're involved</i>

02:43.530 --> 02:45.497
The prosecutors are
dragging their feet.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.000
Well, that's just paranoia.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.067
Colleen:
<i> Maybe.</i>

02:49.103 --> 02:51.069
But if you see an
exit ramp on this?

02:53.207 --> 02:56.275
And following the arrival
of mr. Lincoln on the scene,

02:56.277 --> 02:57.209
What transpired?

02:57.344 --> 02:58.810
Officer coates:
<i> He got in our faces,</i>

02:58.846 --> 03:00.278
<i> Tried to order us around,</i>

03:00.414 --> 03:01.879
And when we didn't
listen to his commands,

03:01.881 --> 03:02.914
He got physical.

03:02.917 --> 03:03.881
How so?

03:03.918 --> 03:04.849
Shoving,

03:04.919 --> 03:06.184
Mixing around with kyle,

03:06.187 --> 03:07.486
Officer allen.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.554
<i> When officer allen then</i>
<i> tried to subdue him,</i>

03:09.557 --> 03:11.323
Mr. Lincoln stabbed
him to death.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.492
Ellery:
<i> How exactly did you</i>
<i> get control of him?</i>

03:13.494 --> 03:14.459
Officer coates:
<i> He used a department</i>
<i> approved method-</i>

03:14.528 --> 03:16.895
They'll never admit
to the chokehold.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.163
She's giving the
cops an opportunity

03:18.298 --> 03:19.831
To control the narrative.

03:19.967 --> 03:20.898
It's smart.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.333
Officer coates:
Hands behind the neck.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.836
Are you familiar
with media reports

03:24.838 --> 03:26.371
That refer to the
term "chokehold"?

03:26.373 --> 03:27.572
Yes.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.908
Did your control method have
the effect of choking anyone?

03:30.043 --> 03:32.511
No, it may seem that
way to the untrained eye

03:32.646 --> 03:34.646
But we're trained to
control aggressive

03:34.715 --> 03:36.581
And violent individuals.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.116
<i> Problem was,</i>
<i> that animal had a knife!</i>

03:38.252 --> 03:39.350
Marcie:
<i> Objection!</i>

03:39.386 --> 03:40.752
Objection, your honour!

03:40.788 --> 03:41.687
Order! Order!

03:41.822 --> 03:43.121
I'm not going to
allow officer coates

03:43.123 --> 03:45.890
To dehumanize my client
with his remarks.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.425
Bailiff, take these
people outside.

03:47.427 --> 03:48.426
<i> Out of my courtroom.</i>

03:48.428 --> 03:50.295
Absolutely disgusting!

03:50.430 --> 03:54.433
(crowd shouting)

03:54.435 --> 03:56.734
Judge kerr:
<i> Take control of your witness,</i>
<i> ms. Lopez.</i>

03:56.770 --> 03:59.570
(dramatic music)

03:59.607 --> 04:01.073
(car horns honking)

04:01.208 --> 04:02.107
Mr. Thompson!

04:02.176 --> 04:05.010
Hey! How are my
first years?

04:05.145 --> 04:07.012
Glad to see some
of you showed up.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.546
I thought you could
use a coffee.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.748
Thanks, elina.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.917
We're wondering if you
got the judge you wanted.

04:12.953 --> 04:13.852
Judge blaney?

04:13.987 --> 04:17.022
Well, wouldn't be
my first choice.

04:17.157 --> 04:20.492
But having a buddy
on the bench can
backfire.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.361
All of a sudden
they're trying so
hard to be impartial,

04:22.496 --> 04:25.763
That they end up
treating you like
their worst enemy.

04:25.799 --> 04:26.698
(laughing)

04:26.833 --> 04:27.965
(clears throat)
remember me?

04:28.002 --> 04:29.500
Your client?

04:29.502 --> 04:30.836
I don't think the
judge is gonna
be impressed

04:30.971 --> 04:32.303
If we're late
for court.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.708
The client
has spoken.

04:36.843 --> 04:37.843
(laughing)

04:37.845 --> 04:39.177
Shall we?

04:40.914 --> 04:43.982
Let's, uh, roll
this back a bit,
officer coates.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.452
<i>So, you, officer allen</i>
<i>and officer ross</i>

04:47.587 --> 04:49.121
Were out for
drinks at hugo's,

04:49.256 --> 04:51.456
<i>A tavern in dartmouth.</i>
<i>Is that correct?</i>

04:51.458 --> 04:52.623
Yes.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.992
And your evidence is
that you all witnessed

04:55.029 --> 04:56.795
Ms. Wilson and
ms. Ross dine and dash?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.263
That's what it
looked like.

04:58.398 --> 05:01.533
Marcie:
<i> You didn't notice that they</i>
<i> left $63.75 on their table?</i>

05:01.668 --> 05:03.368
Officer coates:
<i> No, I didn't.</i>

05:03.503 --> 05:04.802
Did you ask their server?

05:04.838 --> 05:05.870
Officer coates:
<i> No.</i>

05:05.872 --> 05:08.072
We heard melissa say
two women stiffed her,

05:08.108 --> 05:10.008
So kyle,
officer allen,

05:10.143 --> 05:11.410
Went out and we followed.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.811
Marcie:
<i> But melissa murphy,</i>

05:12.813 --> 05:14.279
The server,

05:14.348 --> 05:16.014
Never asked you
to intervene.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.081
No.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.416
Something's happening,
you get involved.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.617
That's the training.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.085
Right, the training.

05:22.222 --> 05:25.357
<i> You're also trained</i>
<i> to identify yourself</i>

05:25.359 --> 05:27.092
<i> When you approach a</i>
<i> member of the public.</i>

05:27.161 --> 05:28.393
You didn't do that

05:28.528 --> 05:30.462
<i> When you approached ms. Wilson</i>
<i> and ms. Brooks, did you?</i>

05:30.597 --> 05:31.630
Sure we did.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.498
Did you show my
client your badges?

05:33.633 --> 05:34.900
There wasn't any time.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.268
How many drinks did
you have that night?

05:37.338 --> 05:38.370
A few.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.471
<i> I don't recall.</i>

05:39.606 --> 05:41.573
(dramatic suspenseful music)

05:41.575 --> 05:45.777
This is your receipt from hugo's
on the night in question.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.278
And according
to your server,

05:48.515 --> 05:51.049
You had eight double
vodkas straight.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.051
<i> Wouldn't you agree that</i>
<i> maybe your judgement</i>

05:53.053 --> 05:54.586
Was just a bit impaired?

05:54.588 --> 05:55.587
Officer coates:
<i> Just because I</i>
<i> ordered the drinks,</i>

05:55.656 --> 05:57.489
Doesn't mean they
were all for me.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.325
<i> So, no, I don't think my</i>
<i> judgement was impaired.</i>

06:00.327 --> 06:02.260
Did you provide
sirt investigators

06:02.396 --> 06:03.395
With a blood sample?

06:03.530 --> 06:04.629
Officer coates:
<i> Yes, I did.</i>

06:04.665 --> 06:06.164
.03.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.999
Right, that was based
on a blood sample

06:08.068 --> 06:10.602
That was taken at 6:30 am
the next morning.

06:10.737 --> 06:11.936
<i> That's plenty of time</i>

06:11.972 --> 06:13.671
<i> For you get the alcohol</i>
<i> out of your system, right?</i>

06:13.707 --> 06:15.040
Ellery:
<i> Objection, your honour.</i>

06:15.042 --> 06:17.809
Ms. Diggs is floating a police
conspiracy without any basis.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.011
Marcie:
<i> Your honour, this is</i>
<i> a sirt investigation</i>

06:20.080 --> 06:21.079
And they wait nine hours-

06:21.081 --> 06:22.280
I agree with ms. Lopez.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.316
I'm not gonna have you call
into question the integrity

06:24.451 --> 06:28.286
<i> Of the entire police</i>
<i> department in my courtroom.</i>

06:28.355 --> 06:31.490
<i>Do you have any further relevant</i>
<i> questions for the witness?</i>

06:31.625 --> 06:33.558
No, I guess not,
your honour.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.729
Doug:
<i> I'm at capacity, colleen.</i>

06:37.798 --> 06:39.096
I can't properly
represent my clients

06:39.133 --> 06:41.032
And take on
marcie's files too.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.300
The police are
overcharging them

06:42.302 --> 06:44.436
Because marcie's
their lawyer.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.637
I don't know what
the alternative is.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.639
Tell marcie to
wrap this up.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.040
To make things
easier on us?

06:49.042 --> 06:51.008
Come on,
I can't do that.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.078
Emily!

06:54.114 --> 06:56.047
Let's catch up on
this later, okay?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.148
Just looking for marcie.

06:57.151 --> 06:58.049
Colleen:
<i> Oh, she's got</i>
<i> court today.</i>

06:58.184 --> 06:59.050
Yeah, I figured that out.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.485
Colleen:
<i> Em, stop.</i>

07:02.122 --> 07:03.455
Are you okay?

07:04.591 --> 07:06.992
Ah, well, still have
headaches, low energy.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.762
<i> At least I'm starting to</i>
<i> get my taste and smell back.</i>

07:10.764 --> 07:13.331
Still only getting supervised
visits with my kids.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.201
Em, I'm so sorry.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.803
<i> If I'd known anything about</i>
<i>asymptomatic carriers back then</i>

07:18.872 --> 07:21.540
I never would have let
my son into our bubble.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.008
I don't know how many
times I can apologize.

07:24.077 --> 07:27.078
I don't have my kids because
of you and this damn virus.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.547
So I got nothing for you.

07:28.682 --> 07:35.587
(chilling electronic music)

07:35.722 --> 07:39.657
(man sighing)

07:41.695 --> 07:43.562
(banging)

07:43.697 --> 07:44.729
I'm sorry,
your honour.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.631
<i> This was working</i>
<i> fine before.</i>

07:47.701 --> 07:49.768
Your honour, perhaps
a recess is in order

07:49.770 --> 07:52.303
To give mr. Mueller
a moment.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.138
Judge blaney:
<i> Have you and mr. Thompson</i>
<i> attempted a resolution</i>

07:54.208 --> 07:55.240
To this matter?

07:55.375 --> 07:57.308
Resolutions proposed
by mr. Mueller

07:57.377 --> 07:58.510
Would make it
difficult for my client

07:58.579 --> 08:00.312
To pursue
employment opportunities.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.713
(electronic whirring)

08:02.583 --> 08:03.548
Judge blaney:
<i> Excellent.</i>

08:03.684 --> 08:05.817
Okay, let's get this
show on the road.

08:05.952 --> 08:09.988
(dramatic music)

08:09.990 --> 08:12.857
Avery:
<i> Now it's clear from this</i>
<i> video that the altercation</i>

08:12.860 --> 08:14.759
<i> Between your father</i>
<i> and the defendant</i>

08:14.895 --> 08:17.261
Started before what
we see on camera.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.096
<i> Can you tell us</i>
<i> what you witnessed?</i>

08:20.267 --> 08:21.866
Dad asked ben when he
was gonna pay the rent.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.234
He's four months late.

08:24.404 --> 08:25.704
<i> Ben said he didn't have</i>
<i> to pay during covid</i>

08:25.839 --> 08:29.608
And he told dad
to eff off.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.142
Then ben pushed him,

08:31.211 --> 08:32.276
Dad fell,

08:32.312 --> 08:33.912
He broke his collarbone.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.413
Thank you.

08:38.685 --> 08:39.617
How tall are you son?

08:39.753 --> 08:40.719
6'6".

08:40.721 --> 08:42.820
Reggie:
<i> What are you,</i>
<i> about 260?</i>

08:42.856 --> 08:43.755
280.

08:43.890 --> 08:44.889
280. (whistles)

08:44.892 --> 08:47.024
You're an opposing guy.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.626
Are you protective
of your dad?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.095
Yessir.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.830
Reggie:
<i> Now isn't it a fact marlo</i>
<i> that you were enlisted</i>

08:51.965 --> 08:53.765
To attend the meeting
with my client

08:53.834 --> 08:57.902
To help your dad persuade
ben sangster to pay the rent?

08:59.206 --> 09:02.440
Ah, dad's old.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.576
People like to try
and take advantage.

09:07.281 --> 09:08.746
That's all,
your honour.

09:08.815 --> 09:12.850
(suspenseful bass music)

09:12.886 --> 09:14.719
Ms. Wilson, could you
describe for the jury

09:14.721 --> 09:16.855
What happened on the night
of officer allen's death?

09:16.857 --> 09:18.790
Rosella:
<i> Aisha and I left</i>
<i> the restaurant.</i>

09:20.127 --> 09:23.227
<i> Some guys followed us out</i>
<i> and started talking to us.</i>

09:24.531 --> 09:27.999
Then mr. Lincoln came over
and he was arguing with them.

09:28.134 --> 09:31.336
<i> They started fighting</i>
<i> and he pulled out a knife</i>

09:31.338 --> 09:33.137
And just stabbed the guy.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.373
Did you call for
mr. Lincoln?

09:36.577 --> 09:38.376
Nah, he came
over on his own.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.879
(scoffs) I was defending her.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.414
Marcie:
<i> Ms. Wilson, your testimony</i>
<i> today is very different</i>

09:43.450 --> 09:45.483
<i> From the statement that</i>
<i> you gave the police</i>

09:45.552 --> 09:46.551
<i> On the night in question.</i>

09:46.686 --> 09:47.852
<i> You previously said:</i>

09:47.888 --> 09:50.521
<i> "thank god mr. Lincoln</i>
<i> arrived when he did</i>

09:50.557 --> 09:53.624
"'cause I didn't know what
the men were gonna do to us."

09:53.660 --> 09:55.059
<i> Why the discrepancy?</i>

09:55.996 --> 09:57.895
I must've been in
shock I guess.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.097
<i> But now I've had more time</i>
<i> to better remember it.</i>

10:00.133 --> 10:01.566
Marcie:
<i> So, three men that</i>
<i> you don't know</i>

10:01.701 --> 10:04.369
<i> Approach you at 10:30 at night</i>
<i> in a vacant parking lot</i>

10:04.438 --> 10:06.371
And you didn't
feel threatened?

10:07.341 --> 10:08.907
I don't remember.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.108
Marcie:
<i> Were they</i>
<i> physical with you?</i>

10:10.110 --> 10:11.910
Rosella:
<i> I don't know,</i>
<i> a lot was happening.</i>

10:12.045 --> 10:13.111
<i> Look, I told you,</i>

10:13.113 --> 10:15.113
He butted in.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.182
Nobody asked him to
play prince charming.

10:17.184 --> 10:21.585
(suspenseful electro music)

10:21.622 --> 10:23.654
Ms. Wilson, has
anybody from the hpd

10:23.690 --> 10:24.789
Asked you to
change your story?

10:24.924 --> 10:26.191
Ellery:<i> Objection!</i>
<i> -</i> I'm not a liar.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.792
Judge kerr:
<i> Ms. Diggs, I've</i>
<i> already asked you</i>

10:27.927 --> 10:29.227
<i> To drop that line</i>
<i> of questioning.</i>

10:29.362 --> 10:30.862
Marcie:
<i> Your honour, I would like</i>
<i> to reserve the right</i>

10:30.864 --> 10:33.398
To continue cross-examining the
witness later on in the trial.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.365
Judge kerr:
<i> Granted.</i>

10:34.401 --> 10:36.101
The witness
may step down.

10:36.236 --> 10:40.271
(dramatic music)

10:40.340 --> 10:41.739
They got to her.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.175
(dramatic music swells)

10:47.681 --> 10:50.481
Avery:
<i> Listen, I was thinking</i>
<i> we could go to gio</i>

10:50.550 --> 10:51.816
<i> On Friday for dinner.</i>

10:53.186 --> 10:55.286
Ahhhh, mm.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.489
Actually Friday's the
diggs' family dinner.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.491
Can't wait for my parents to
play tug-o-war with us then.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.027
Okay, well then I
should bring something.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.895
Oh, it's actually, um...

11:04.931 --> 11:06.297
It's actually just family.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.701
<i> Dad's just not, um...</i>

11:11.104 --> 11:15.306
He's just not ready to invite
you since after rolanda, um...

11:17.844 --> 11:18.943
You don't wanna be
part of the whole

11:18.945 --> 11:20.745
Austin and velma
show anyway,

11:20.747 --> 11:21.946
Trust me.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.582
Well, I hope the avery-ban
doesn't last forever.

11:26.019 --> 11:31.122
Ah, how's your hell's kitchen
case coming along with reggie?

11:31.158 --> 11:32.523
Oh yeah (chuckles).

11:32.592 --> 11:33.791
It's actually tougher
than I thought,

11:33.927 --> 11:34.992
He's playing hardball.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.327
Marcie:
(chuckles)<i> reggie?</i>

11:36.463 --> 11:37.762
Reggie, reggie?

11:38.732 --> 11:40.197
Say reggie one more time.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.399
(both laughing)

11:43.070 --> 11:45.136
Marcie:
<i> Jamal swan is up</i>
<i> first this morning.</i>

11:45.271 --> 11:46.137
<i> Can he hurt us?</i>

11:46.272 --> 11:47.638
Jamal? No.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.609
He likes to clown,
but he's still my boy.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.344
Colleen:
<i> Tough day in</i>
<i> court yesterday.</i>

11:54.414 --> 11:55.947
What's the strategy?

11:55.949 --> 11:58.816
Marcie:
<i> To find out who scared our</i>
<i>witness into perjuring herself.</i>

11:58.852 --> 12:01.986
And convince the jury
I'm telling the truth.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.854
Has the crown come
to you with a deal?

12:03.890 --> 12:06.825
I ain't takin' no
deal, colleen.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.193
<i> These people want</i>
<i> me on my knees.</i>

12:09.262 --> 12:10.762
Let them fight for it.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.329
Look, our involvement
in your case

12:12.365 --> 12:14.365
Is creating issues for
our other clients.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.568
<i> We're being forced</i>
<i> to file subpoenas</i>

12:16.703 --> 12:17.968
<i> To get cops to testify.</i>

12:17.970 --> 12:19.838
<i> Plea bargaining has</i>
<i> virtually stopped.</i>

12:21.040 --> 12:22.973
This isn't just about you.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.844
This wouldn't be about
protecting the judgeship

12:26.913 --> 12:28.246
You're up for would it?

12:30.116 --> 12:32.116
(scoffs) wow.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.051
<i> You know your problem, percy?</i>

12:34.087 --> 12:36.053
You don't know who
your friends are.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.996
Reggie, do you have
a minute, sir?

12:45.131 --> 12:46.264
Sure.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.601
See how curious
my students are?

12:50.670 --> 12:53.604
They want to see the wheels
of justice in motion.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.006
Look, fine.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.674
Here's something
you can teach them.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.543
Right now with the
aggravated assault charge,

12:58.678 --> 13:00.378
We're going for summary.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.613
Can always decide
to go indictable.

13:01.748 --> 13:02.747
Cut the crap.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.282
You're not gonna start over.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.850
Don't force my hand, reggie.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.288
What's that mean?

13:10.290 --> 13:11.222
What's "indictment"?

13:11.357 --> 13:12.523
Well, if he changes
it to indictable

13:12.526 --> 13:15.793
The maximum sentence goes
from six months to ten years.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.628
(slow dramatic music)

13:17.664 --> 13:19.363
Should I take a deal?

13:19.399 --> 13:21.199
(chuckles) he's
just playing games.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.701
No, the deal was bad before,
it's gonna be worse now.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.135
Don't worry.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.404
We still got moves.

13:26.406 --> 13:31.175
(slow dramatic music)

13:38.785 --> 13:40.585
I'll be okay.

13:40.654 --> 13:44.522
(people chattering)

13:44.524 --> 13:45.923
Darcelle's not gonna stay?

13:46.059 --> 13:49.727
The arena gets me,
not my family.

13:49.796 --> 13:50.862
Officer ross:
<i> I don't care.</i>

13:50.997 --> 13:53.865
<i> I told you I'm</i>
<i> not testifying.</i>

13:54.000 --> 13:56.066
What makes you think
you have a choice?

13:56.102 --> 13:57.268
Officer ross:
<i> Whatever.</i>

13:58.137 --> 13:59.470
She doesn't look happy.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.807
Mr. Swan, can you
please tell the court

14:02.809 --> 14:04.275
How you know
percy lincoln.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.944
Yeah, we've known
each other for a while,

14:05.946 --> 14:07.478
Run in the same circles.

14:07.480 --> 14:11.015
Just two men trying to
make change in the world.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.484
Ellery:
<i> The same circles as in?</i>

14:13.553 --> 14:15.853
Jamal:
<i> You know,</i>
<i> rallies, committees,</i>

14:15.856 --> 14:17.154
Stuff like that.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.357
Like say, the community
policy initiative committee?

14:20.393 --> 14:23.160
Yes. That's one I
organized myself.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.366
Ellery:
<i> Could you please tell</i>
<i> us what this is?</i>

14:28.368 --> 14:29.433
Jamal:
<i> That's the committee.</i>

14:29.502 --> 14:30.902
It's almost everybody.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.003
The turnout was great.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.772
Can you please identify
that person right there?

14:35.508 --> 14:36.908
That's percy lincoln.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.242
And who is that beside him?

14:38.311 --> 14:40.311
That's me,
looking fresh.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.146
(ellery chuckles)

14:42.215 --> 14:43.915
Ellery:
<i> Just one more.</i>

14:43.917 --> 14:46.250
<i> Who's that, a few people</i>
<i> down from the defendant?</i>

14:46.253 --> 14:50.254
(suspenseful music)

14:50.257 --> 14:53.290
Jamal:
<i> Um, that's uh...</i>

14:55.395 --> 14:56.760
Ellery:
<i> I can get the</i>
<i> committee registry</i>

14:56.796 --> 14:58.095
<i> To help you if</i>
<i> you need it.</i>

14:58.097 --> 15:00.965
(suspenseful music)

15:00.967 --> 15:02.500
That's kyle allen.

15:02.502 --> 15:06.271
Officer kyle allen,
now deceased.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.674
<i> So officer kyle allen and the</i>
<i> defendant knew each other?</i>

15:09.743 --> 15:11.409
They were on the same
committee, yes.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.544
Ellery:
<i> Did you witness clashes</i>
<i> between officer allen</i>

15:13.613 --> 15:14.979
And the defendant?

15:15.015 --> 15:16.380
They disagreed.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.515
How would you characterize
those disagreements?

15:18.517 --> 15:19.883
Well, you know,
percy's a passionate guy

15:19.920 --> 15:24.155
And sometimes his passion
gets the best of him.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.858
Like it did the night
he murdered officer allen?

15:26.860 --> 15:28.826
Objection. Argumentative.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.160
I'm good, your honour.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.165
Marcie:
<i> I have no questions</i>
<i> for the witness.</i>

15:34.234 --> 15:35.699
The crown rests,
your honour.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.101
The witness is dismissed.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.937
<i> Ms. Diggs, are you</i>
<i> ready to commence?</i>

15:39.072 --> 15:40.237
Marcie:
<i> Yes, your honour.</i>

15:40.273 --> 15:41.839
<i> The defence calls</i>
<i> our first witness,</i>

15:41.875 --> 15:43.240
Aisha brooks.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.844
<i> Uh, no response,</i>
<i> your honour.</i>

15:46.913 --> 15:49.247
(dramatic music)

15:49.382 --> 15:50.648
Marlo, what's-

15:50.650 --> 15:51.782
What's going on?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.050
They're arresting me
for breaking and entering.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.419
They're saying I
stole that videotape.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.519
(thud)

15:55.555 --> 15:56.454
Can you please
call my dad?

15:56.589 --> 15:57.455
Listen, I'm on it, okay?

15:57.590 --> 15:59.023
Just stay calm.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.192
<i> Better quit playing</i>
<i> around here, reggie.</i>

16:01.194 --> 16:02.560
Reggie:
<i> Oh, the client</i>
<i> filed a complaint.</i>

16:02.629 --> 16:03.828
It's nothing to do with me.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.162
Ben sangster is a tenant.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.230
He doesn't own the building-

16:06.266 --> 16:07.598
But he owns the camera.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.334
He had it installed
at his own expense.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.403
You're walking awfully close
to the line here, reggie.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.938
Reggie:
<i> Aw come on, you would</i>
<i> have done the same.</i>

16:14.073 --> 16:15.473
You're just mad 'cause
I outplayed ya.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.708
<i> No, I'm mad about</i>
<i> you playing,</i>

16:17.744 --> 16:18.643
Instead of sitting
down and discussing

16:18.778 --> 16:20.477
A plea deal for
your client.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.879
(car engine turning over)

16:23.950 --> 16:26.484
Is this good for
mr. Sangster?

16:26.619 --> 16:28.085
Well, here's the
way it works.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.822
Because we now know that marlo
had custody of the video,

16:30.957 --> 16:33.290
We may be able to establish
that he tampered with it.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.893
Now the court may find that
in admissible because...

16:35.929 --> 16:37.562
It's not an
accurate representation

16:37.697 --> 16:39.430
Of the events it's
supposed to depict.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.565
Excellent.

16:40.700 --> 16:47.438
(upbeat music)

16:48.841 --> 16:50.708
Aisha voicemail:
<i> Hi, it's aisha brooks.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

16:50.710 --> 16:51.809
(marcie sighs)

16:56.416 --> 16:57.781
Marcie:
<i> Officer ross.</i>

16:59.919 --> 17:01.185
Unless you're delivering
my burrito bowl,

17:01.320 --> 17:02.453
I got nothing
to say to you.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.755
It'll only take a minute.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.157
You have 'til my
food arrives.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.463
Thanks for talking to me.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.133
You can do all the talking.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.069
I don't wanna be
anywhere near this.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.204
Is that how you
felt that night?

17:20.273 --> 17:22.874
Like you didn't wanna
be anywhere near it?

17:23.009 --> 17:26.477
You know, percy said that you
stayed mostly uninvolved.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.112
I won't make a good witness.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.282
You know, a man's life
is at stake here.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.616
And what about my life?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.287
You put me on that stand,
I won't say what you want.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.156
I-I can't.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.224
So then my client
just goes to jail?

17:41.861 --> 17:43.761
Another future
claimed by the system?

17:45.165 --> 17:47.365
Why is his future
more valuable than mine?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.166
<i> Hmm, answer me that?</i>

17:49.302 --> 17:50.835
<i> You want me to go to</i>
<i> court and tell everyone</i>

17:50.904 --> 17:52.570
What a terrible person
kyle allen was?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.738
Sure. And guess what?

17:54.808 --> 17:56.106
<i> Any career aspirations,</i>

17:56.108 --> 18:00.444
Any chance of making real
change inside hpd is flushed.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.413
<i> Is my black life less valuable</i>
<i> because I wear a badge?</i>

18:06.519 --> 18:07.684
No.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.456
It's because in a moment
that required courage,

18:12.692 --> 18:14.992
You displayed a
stunning lack.

18:15.028 --> 18:17.795
(tense music)

18:17.930 --> 18:19.096
(phone ringing)

18:20.767 --> 18:23.734
Aisha? Where are you?

18:24.604 --> 18:25.903
Reggie:
<i> Mr. Ricci,</i>

18:26.038 --> 18:28.239
<i> What was your intent</i>
<i> when you took your son,</i>

18:28.374 --> 18:30.074
A semi-pro hockey player,

18:30.076 --> 18:33.010
To visit my client while he
was alone in his restaurant?

18:33.046 --> 18:35.212
Ben hadn't paid his rent.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.281
<i> I wanted to talk</i>
<i> to him man-to-man.</i>

18:37.283 --> 18:39.250
You mean man-to-men?

18:39.319 --> 18:40.684
Mr. Ricci:
<i> We had an agreement.</i>

18:40.720 --> 18:41.686
Reggie:
<i> That's right.</i>

18:41.821 --> 18:45.089
Now I have an email here
from April of last year,

18:45.091 --> 18:47.758
<i> Which says you'd</i>
<i> be happy to give</i>

18:47.827 --> 18:50.561
Mr. Sangster a
reprieve on the rent.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.762
What changed?

18:51.831 --> 18:53.431
Mr. Ricci:
<i> Nothing changed.</i>

18:53.433 --> 18:55.466
<i> We followed up by phone</i>

18:55.468 --> 18:59.237
And ben said he'd repay the
full amount after four months.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.772
Did you record any of
these phone calls?

19:01.774 --> 19:03.941
Mr. Ricci:
<i> Why would I need to</i>
<i> record my phone calls?</i>

19:05.912 --> 19:07.845
Isn't a man's word enough?

19:09.282 --> 19:12.149
Reggie:
<i> Given the lockdowns</i>
<i> and reduced business,</i>

19:12.152 --> 19:14.886
How did you expect your tenant
to come up with the rent?

19:16.355 --> 19:18.455
(dramatic music)

19:18.491 --> 19:21.091
I've been in this country
for more than forty years,

19:23.596 --> 19:25.462
I have dug ditches,

19:25.464 --> 19:26.997
Troweled cement floors,

19:27.066 --> 19:31.135
Whatever was necessary to
honour an agreement once made.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.139
You people act like
this is the first time

19:35.274 --> 19:37.208
We've lived
through hard times.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.610
<i> In 2008, we were</i>
<i> just scraping by.</i>

19:39.745 --> 19:40.945
When we couldn't
pay for cleaning

19:41.014 --> 19:42.280
And maintenance
on the building,

19:42.282 --> 19:44.215
My son did it for free.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.083
Reggie:
<i> Ah yes, the maintenance.</i>

19:46.119 --> 19:48.686
There was an electrical problem
in the restaurant dining room

19:48.688 --> 19:51.789
That went unfixed
for four weeks.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.024
Mr. Ricci:
(scoffs)<i> without the</i>
<i> income from the rent,</i>

19:53.159 --> 19:55.026
I-I couldn't pay
an electrician.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.229
Now every week I'm getting
calls from the bank

19:58.231 --> 20:00.564
Because I can't pay my mortgage
because of your client.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.768
Reggie:
<i> So you and your son decided to</i>
<i> strong arm ben for the rent?</i>

20:03.903 --> 20:05.503
Mr. Ricci:
<i> No. No!</i>

20:05.505 --> 20:08.372
(suspenseful music)

20:08.374 --> 20:11.108
I expected him to be
a man of his word.

20:11.177 --> 20:15.179
(suspenseful music)

20:15.248 --> 20:17.047
Thank you, mr. Ricci.

20:19.752 --> 20:20.951
(reggie grunts)

20:20.954 --> 20:21.852
(suspenseful music)

20:21.988 --> 20:23.520
Reggie:
<i> He put on a good show.</i>

20:23.556 --> 20:25.355
Don't worry,
you'll get your turn.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.925
Aisha:
<i> I'm sorry but I</i>
<i> can't testify.</i>

20:29.796 --> 20:32.329
But aisha we
talked about this.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.331
<i> Without you corroborating</i>
<i> percy's side of the story,</i>

20:34.467 --> 20:35.799
He goes to prison.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.268
I can't risk losing my kid.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.671
Losing your?

20:42.007 --> 20:44.141
I'm sorry, what are
you talking about?

20:44.210 --> 20:46.143
Rosella told me
what they did.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.747
<i> I don't even have a record,</i>
<i> but they're the cops!</i>

20:49.816 --> 20:52.083
They can do what they want,
the truth doesn't matter.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.153
Aisha, you need to
tell me right now:

20:56.222 --> 20:58.889
<i> What exactly did</i>
<i> they say to rosella,</i>

20:58.958 --> 21:00.558
And who exactly said it?

21:00.560 --> 21:02.926
(intense dramatic music)

21:05.865 --> 21:08.299
Call
<i> rosella wilson to the stand.</i>

21:09.435 --> 21:12.569
<i> Ms. Wilson, do you have</i>
<i> a criminal record?</i>

21:12.605 --> 21:13.771
Objection, relevance?

21:13.773 --> 21:14.738
Judge kerr:
<i> Overruled.</i>

21:14.807 --> 21:16.140
The witness will answer.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.811
Marcie:
<i> Rosella,</i>

21:20.847 --> 21:23.914
<i> You will not be in trouble</i>
<i> for having a criminal record.</i>

21:24.050 --> 21:25.415
<i> But you will</i>
<i> be in trouble</i>

21:25.451 --> 21:27.651
If you do not tell
the truth here today.

21:27.654 --> 21:31.922
(suspenseful music)

21:31.924 --> 21:34.792
I pled guilty to
theft when I was 17.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.461
Marcie:
<i> And did anyone</i>
<i> approach you,</i>

21:37.497 --> 21:39.329
And try to use
this information

21:39.365 --> 21:42.499
To get you to change
your testimony?

21:42.535 --> 21:44.401
The other officer
from that night.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.804
Marcie:
<i> Officer coates or</i>
<i> officer ross?</i>

21:46.806 --> 21:48.205
Officer coates.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.274
<i> I work at a bank.</i>

21:51.477 --> 21:53.611
<i> He told me it</i>
<i> would be a shame</i>

21:53.613 --> 21:56.614
<i> If my work found out</i>
<i> about my criminal record.</i>

21:56.616 --> 21:58.549
<i> Listen, I really</i>
<i> need this job.</i>

21:59.952 --> 22:02.419
My dad can't work anymore
and my mom's sick.

22:03.256 --> 22:04.654
Marcie:
<i> In light of this,</i>

22:04.691 --> 22:07.390
Would you like to change
your earlier testimony?

22:07.392 --> 22:11.362
(suspenseful music)

22:11.431 --> 22:12.796
We didn't dine and dash.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.434
<i> The waitress billed</i>
<i> us extra by mistake,</i>

22:16.436 --> 22:18.569
<i> So we dropped what</i>
<i> we owed and left.</i>

22:19.672 --> 22:22.039
Those guys were chirping
us way before that.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.609
Marcie:
<i> And they were verbally</i>
<i> harassing you how?</i>

22:25.611 --> 22:27.645
Rosella:
<i> Complaining that we</i>
<i> laughed too loud,</i>

22:27.647 --> 22:29.780
<i> That we were on our</i>
<i> phones too much.</i>

22:29.816 --> 22:31.649
<i> Then they</i>
<i> followed us outside,</i>

22:31.784 --> 22:33.918
<i> Started insulting us,</i>

22:33.920 --> 22:35.453
<i> Getting in our faces.</i>

22:37.590 --> 22:39.590
One guy started
yanking me around.

22:41.094 --> 22:42.126
<i> Then mr. Lincoln</i>
<i> showed up</i>

22:42.261 --> 22:44.327
<i> And he tried to</i>
<i> calm everyone down.</i>

22:45.264 --> 22:46.864
He was trying to help.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.298
Marcie:
<i> Thank you, rosella.</i>

22:49.468 --> 22:50.735
No further questions.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.307
Ellery:
<i> Ms. Wilson,</i>

22:56.309 --> 22:59.677
What statement of yours do you
think the court should consider?

22:59.679 --> 23:01.011
What I just said.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.546
Ellery:
<i> What you just said,</i>

23:02.548 --> 23:03.948
Or what you said yesterday,

23:04.083 --> 23:05.749
Or what you said
five months ago?

23:05.752 --> 23:06.950
<i> I can't keep your</i>
<i> lies straight.</i>

23:07.019 --> 23:08.419
Objection. Badgering.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.187
Is there a question,
ms. Lopez?

23:12.525 --> 23:13.824
Did you know that
officer allen

23:13.959 --> 23:15.292
And mr. Lincoln
knew each other?

23:15.328 --> 23:16.760
Rosella:
<i> No, I just-</i>

23:16.763 --> 23:19.630
Ellery:
<i> Did officer allen say</i>
<i> anything to the defendant</i>

23:19.699 --> 23:22.099
That would suggest they
had a prior relationship?

23:24.036 --> 23:25.769
He said something like,

23:25.772 --> 23:28.239
"look who's here
to save the day."

23:28.374 --> 23:30.508
And what did that
mean to you at the time?

23:30.643 --> 23:31.709
I didn't think about it.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.010
Ellery:
<i> I want you to think</i>
<i> about it now.</i>

23:35.148 --> 23:37.314
I guess they
knew each other.

23:37.316 --> 23:39.950
(dramatic suspenseful music)

23:39.952 --> 23:41.452
I'm good, your honour.

23:41.454 --> 23:46.857
(dramatic suspenseful music)

23:46.893 --> 23:49.259
Ms. Diggs, can we
chat for a second?

23:50.463 --> 23:53.530
About the witness
intimidation of rosella wilson?

23:53.566 --> 23:54.531
Happy to.

23:54.666 --> 23:55.933
Hardly.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.135
I'm actually here to
offer you a bone.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.203
Twelve to fourteen.

23:59.272 --> 24:00.804
He's out in eight.

24:00.873 --> 24:04.307
Ellery, do you know
who my client is?

24:04.343 --> 24:05.942
<i> Percy lincoln's not</i>
<i> gonna accept a deal,</i>

24:05.978 --> 24:08.479
Especially in a case where
a cop is trying to kill him.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.046
That's his story.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.882
Marcie:
<i> I think you underestimate</i>
<i>where the jury's sympathy lies.</i>

24:11.951 --> 24:14.017
Ellery:
<i> Or maybe you are.</i>

24:14.053 --> 24:15.953
Not everyone resides in
the same echo chamber

24:15.955 --> 24:17.521
As percy lincoln.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.323
<i> Most people are like</i>
<i> judge kerr and I,</i>

24:19.392 --> 24:20.524
<i> We respect the police</i>

24:20.560 --> 24:22.960
And are tired of hearing
him demonize them.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.361
Marcie:
<i> Yeah, well,</i>

24:24.363 --> 24:27.130
If both my parents were
cops I'd feel the same way.

24:29.034 --> 24:30.167
Talk to your client.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.601
Let me know.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.138
Colleen:
<i> Don't tell me your office</i>

24:35.174 --> 24:37.007
<i> Doesn't have an</i>
<i> issue with marcie.</i>

24:37.142 --> 24:39.443
Every single one of her
files that I've reassigned

24:39.445 --> 24:40.777
Has made movement
towards resolution.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.246
Personality conflicts
happen, colleen.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.648
(laughing) really, martin?

24:44.717 --> 24:46.517
Well, it's a hell of
a lot more plausible

24:46.652 --> 24:49.253
Than that "plot against
marcie diggs" theory

24:49.255 --> 24:50.321
That you're floating.

24:50.456 --> 24:53.390
Look, I'm asking you
to right the ship.

24:53.392 --> 24:55.726
Okay, this is about
the clients not marcie.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.430
I'll speak to the lawyers.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.335
Ms. Diggs' defence of
percy lincoln is a factor

25:04.470 --> 25:05.803
In the way they're
handling cases,

25:05.805 --> 25:06.870
I'll deal with it.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.539
And that's all I ask.

25:08.608 --> 25:11.207
What are these people
gonna do without you

25:11.244 --> 25:12.543
If you get that judgeship?

25:13.880 --> 25:15.278
Well, they'll figure it out.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.949
Uh huh.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.319
Percy:
<i> So, what's good,</i>
<i> marcie diggs?</i>

25:23.656 --> 25:24.955
I received an offer.

25:26.892 --> 25:28.258
Fulfill your duty.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.428
It's twelve to fourteen,
out in eight.

25:31.430 --> 25:32.830
Wow!

25:32.832 --> 25:34.798
They really think
they got me, huh?

25:35.835 --> 25:39.236
Hey, you're gonna
have to earn it.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.471
<i> You understand me?</i>

25:41.541 --> 25:43.907
<i> You're gonna</i>
<i> have to earn it!</i>

25:44.977 --> 25:46.343
Judge kerr:
<i> Is there an issue?</i>

25:46.345 --> 25:47.644
No, your honour.

25:48.714 --> 25:49.579
Judge kerr:
<i> Are you ready to proceed?</i>

25:49.615 --> 25:57.187
(soft dramatic music)

25:57.323 --> 25:58.522
Your honour,

25:58.657 --> 26:00.524
Given the
lateness of the day,

26:00.526 --> 26:03.326
The defence requests a recess
until tomorrow morning.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.129
Judge kerr:
<i> Request granted.</i>

26:05.264 --> 26:07.531
<i> We'll come back tomorrow,</i>
<i> 10:00 am.</i>

26:07.666 --> 26:08.798
We're adjourned
for the day.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.134
Bailiff:
<i> All rise.</i>

26:11.170 --> 26:12.469
Really appreciate
you taking the time

26:12.505 --> 26:13.537
To come see me today.

26:13.672 --> 26:14.838
Darcelle:
<i> Of course.</i>

26:15.775 --> 26:18.008
Is this about me
helping you convince

26:18.077 --> 26:20.411
Percy to be reasonable?

26:22.114 --> 26:24.081
(laughing) I guess
percy wouldn't be with a

26:24.216 --> 26:25.749
"beat around the bush" type.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.686
I wanna talk about
percy and this trial.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.622
<i> What happens if</i>
<i> he's found guilty?</i>

26:31.757 --> 26:33.557
I mean, have you two
discussed the possibility

26:33.626 --> 26:35.492
Of him taking a plea?

26:35.561 --> 26:38.161
Darcelle:
<i> I understand you're</i>
<i> concerned about this place,</i>

26:38.197 --> 26:40.430
But we all knew
this day would come

26:40.466 --> 26:42.666
<i> When there would be</i>
<i> some false allegation,</i>

26:42.702 --> 26:44.635
Some made up charge.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.237
But percy and I came
in from the streets,

26:47.239 --> 26:48.305
We don't run from a fight.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.307
And if your kids
lose their father?

26:51.444 --> 26:54.477
You say that like he's
being left at a walmart.

26:54.513 --> 26:55.846
<i> Here's the thing.</i>

26:57.183 --> 26:58.916
If percy's found guilty,

26:59.051 --> 27:01.751
It'll bring him
back to reality.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.521
<i> This playing with trying</i>
<i> to change the system</i>

27:04.523 --> 27:06.156
<i> From the inside out,</i>

27:07.093 --> 27:08.993
I warned him it
would never work.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.094
It would make him soft.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.598
Now, here we are.

27:15.668 --> 27:18.202
(stammering) I don't understand.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.137
I mean, do you want
him to go to jail?

27:20.272 --> 27:21.671
No, not at all.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.108
But we don't
white flag shit.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.545
We never have, so.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.717
(door buzzer humming)

27:33.786 --> 27:34.984
(marcie sighs)

27:37.757 --> 27:38.955
Percy:
<i> Are you for real?</i>

27:39.025 --> 27:40.157
I educated her.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.959
Don't blame her for trying.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.161
I'm just gonna be a minute.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.161
It's okay. I drove.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.563
I'll see you at home.
-Okay.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.969
That's not right, colleen.
That's not right.

27:52.104 --> 27:52.970
Marcie:
<i> What were you thinking?</i>

27:53.105 --> 27:54.070
Colleen:
<i> What was I thinking?</i>

27:54.106 --> 27:55.739
She was thinking
that this guy's case

27:55.741 --> 27:57.107
Is putting a strain
on the rest of us.

27:57.109 --> 27:59.509
With respect, doug,
this is not about you.

27:59.545 --> 28:00.777
Not about me?

28:00.846 --> 28:02.779
I've had five or six of
your cases dropped on me

28:02.815 --> 28:04.181
'cause no one at the crown
wants to deal with you

28:04.250 --> 28:05.248
While you're
representing him.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.651
Oh, so the moment a
client becomes unpopular

28:08.688 --> 28:09.920
We just drop them,
is that it?

28:09.989 --> 28:11.655
No, that's not what
doug is saying at all.

28:11.790 --> 28:12.990
That's not what
I'm saying.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.458
The crown offered
you a deal

28:14.460 --> 28:15.992
And you dismissed
it out of hand.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.594
No, I discussed
it with my client

28:17.596 --> 28:18.728
And we rejected the offer.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.930
I mean, if I'm going to
jail for eight years,

28:20.966 --> 28:23.133
I might as well see this
thing through to the end.

28:23.169 --> 28:25.169
Colleen:
<i> What is the exit</i>
<i> ramp on this, percy?</i>

28:25.171 --> 28:27.404
Percy:
<i> The supreme court of canada</i>
<i> is the exit ramp.</i>

28:27.473 --> 28:29.006
Colleen:
(laughing)<i> wow.</i>

28:29.141 --> 28:31.608
It's always about
the show with you!

28:31.677 --> 28:34.478
Is this justice, colleen?

28:34.480 --> 28:35.879
What's happening to me?

28:35.881 --> 28:37.814
Is this "just" to you?

28:37.950 --> 28:39.783
<i> Me being</i>
<i> prosecuted like this.</i>

28:39.819 --> 28:40.850
<i> For what?</i>

28:40.886 --> 28:42.486
'cause I chose to
be a good guy,

28:42.621 --> 28:43.754
They get to take
my freedom?

28:43.889 --> 28:45.088
No dear!

28:45.124 --> 28:46.423
Colleen:
<i> We should've never</i>
<i> gotten involved in this.</i>

28:46.558 --> 28:47.824
This was a mistake.

28:49.462 --> 28:50.994
Well, I hereby release you.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.429
<i> Halifax legal aid</i>
<i> no longer bears</i>

28:53.466 --> 28:54.698
The responsibility
of my defence.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.366
Marcie:
<i> Wait, what are you</i>
<i> talking about?</i>

28:56.368 --> 28:57.768
I'm your lawyer.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.237
Thank you, marcie.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.738
For everything.

29:03.642 --> 29:10.314
(dramatic music)

29:10.449 --> 29:11.447
Marcie:
<i> Really?</i>

29:11.484 --> 29:17.320
(dramatic music)

29:17.356 --> 29:21.658
♪

29:21.694 --> 29:22.725
I'm sorry,

29:22.762 --> 29:23.726
But this had to end.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.128
Yeah, me too.

29:26.232 --> 29:27.131
What are you doing?

29:27.266 --> 29:28.899
Uh, I quit.

29:29.034 --> 29:31.334
(dramatic music)

29:31.370 --> 29:32.735
I'm done.

29:37.576 --> 29:38.876
Percy:
<i> I talked to darcelle.</i>

29:41.346 --> 29:42.946
My daughters are ten.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.917
I can't go to prison
for eight years.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.022
I'm gonna see if there's
any room in her offer.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.690
Percy, we-

29:53.759 --> 29:55.492
We can still
win this thing.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.795
I can see why you
wanna take the risk,

30:00.699 --> 30:02.665
But it's my neck
in the noose.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.102
Go back to legal aid,

30:06.172 --> 30:08.505
Keep doing the
good work you do.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.642
(slow dramatic music)

30:12.711 --> 30:14.111
What happened to the fight?

30:19.185 --> 30:21.317
I'm reading "children
of blood and bone"

30:21.353 --> 30:22.653
With my daughters.

30:23.956 --> 30:27.524
We've got about 100 pages
left and I'm a slow reader.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.429
The possibility of leaving,

30:32.498 --> 30:36.800
Of everything that
would be left unfinished,

30:36.935 --> 30:38.802
<i> The cost of that fight</i>
<i> got real tonight.</i>

30:42.208 --> 30:46.142
You came to the defence
of two black women.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.012
<i> You wanna let them take</i>
<i> your life for that?</i>

30:49.148 --> 30:50.446
It's your call.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.217
But I am here.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.554
I'm in this.

30:58.591 --> 31:04.560
(sombre music)

31:05.831 --> 31:07.431
Percy:
<i> My sisters looked like</i>
<i> they needed help.</i>

31:09.101 --> 31:11.768
I'm always gonna
protect black women,

31:11.770 --> 31:13.169
So that's what I did.

31:13.972 --> 31:14.838
Next thing I know,

31:14.973 --> 31:17.340
Officer allen's got
me in a chokehold.

31:19.612 --> 31:21.111
I started to lose my vision.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.115
All of the shouting,

31:25.117 --> 31:26.849
Even my own voice,

31:26.886 --> 31:29.853
It all seemed far away.

31:32.625 --> 31:33.990
I couldn't breathe.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.929
I couldn't breathe.

31:41.901 --> 31:43.633
This was it for me,
I thought.

31:45.437 --> 31:48.005
I'm gonna die like this.

31:49.508 --> 31:55.212
This is the moment I
die at the hands of a cop

31:55.347 --> 31:57.714
For doing nothing other
than the right thing.

32:00.319 --> 32:01.918
What made you
wanna fight back?

32:03.822 --> 32:06.223
I didn't wanna be
another face for a mural

32:06.225 --> 32:09.025
Or a posthumous
"vanity fair" cover.

32:10.930 --> 32:14.631
I have a wife
and daughters

32:14.766 --> 32:19.236
And I remembered they
were sleeping when I left

32:19.371 --> 32:21.304
And I didn't tell
them I love them.

32:22.908 --> 32:27.044
I needed to get home so I
could tell them just that.

32:30.649 --> 32:34.317
And I heard the
box cutter in my pocket

32:34.320 --> 32:35.919
Scraping against
the pavement.

32:36.054 --> 32:37.988
(scraping echoes)

32:37.990 --> 32:39.355
And I grabbed it.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.859
And I just kept
stabbing officer allen

32:42.895 --> 32:44.060
Until he stopped
choking me.

32:44.196 --> 32:45.461
(flesh slashing echoes)

32:47.433 --> 32:49.399
I didn't know how
many times that was.

32:50.903 --> 32:52.435
And when he finally
let you go?

32:54.306 --> 32:56.406
I wanted to get
home to my family.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.077
Tell my daughters
I love them.

33:01.613 --> 33:02.979
That I was okay.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.617
That I was gonna live.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.423
Thank you, percy.

33:20.733 --> 33:22.499
Ellery:
<i> Mr. Lincoln,</i>

33:22.568 --> 33:24.500
<i> You didn't like officer allen</i>
<i> all that much, did you?</i>

33:24.536 --> 33:26.970
No, I did not.

33:27.105 --> 33:30.841
Ellery:
<i>So when you saw the opportunity</i>
<i> to get into it with him,</i>

33:30.843 --> 33:31.775
You took it?

33:31.910 --> 33:33.577
Look, I had no
idea who he was.

33:33.579 --> 33:34.511
Ellery:
<i> No?</i>

33:34.580 --> 33:36.312
How many months
did you serve on the

33:36.382 --> 33:38.381
Community policy
initiative committee?

33:38.516 --> 33:40.283
Six months maybe.

33:40.285 --> 33:41.651
It was a while ago.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.887
Ellery:
<i> You worked in close</i>
<i> quarters with officer allen</i>

33:44.022 --> 33:46.790
For six months and you
expect this court to believe

33:46.792 --> 33:48.859
That you didn't
recognize him?

33:48.861 --> 33:53.329
Look, there were eighteen
people on that committee

33:53.365 --> 33:55.131
And I'm on a ton
of committees.

33:56.468 --> 33:59.269
In fact, I was part of the
"know your rights committee"

33:59.338 --> 34:01.271
At dalhousie a
few years back.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.340
Does one of its members,

34:03.342 --> 34:07.577
An ellery lopez,
remember me?

34:07.712 --> 34:08.678
You can ask me
that question

34:08.747 --> 34:11.247
When I'm the one on
trial for murder.

34:11.249 --> 34:13.583
(spectators chatter)

34:13.718 --> 34:16.953
Reggie:
<i> So even when your restaurant's</i>
<i> running at full capacity,</i>

34:16.955 --> 34:20.123
<i> Your profit margins</i>
<i> are only three to 5%?</i>

34:20.258 --> 34:21.791
Ben:
<i> Yeah, that's right.</i>

34:21.926 --> 34:24.427
Fast food restaurants have
a profit margin of six to 9%

34:24.463 --> 34:27.497
But with a high-end restaurant
like mine, it's lower.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.566
<i> With lockdowns and</i>
<i> distancing measures,</i>

34:29.635 --> 34:31.101
It's basically zero.

34:31.236 --> 34:33.169
That's why I was unable
to pay the rent.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.640
Unable to pay the rent.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.575
Ben:
<i> Right, which is,</i>
<i> um, uh, $6,900.</i>

34:39.611 --> 34:42.044
It's one of the highest
per square foot in halifax.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.013
Reggie:
<i> Thank you, mr. Sangster.</i>

34:44.083 --> 34:45.781
Mr. Sangster,

34:45.783 --> 34:48.084
<i> You took full advantage</i>
<i> of government subsidies</i>

34:48.120 --> 34:49.418
During covid, correct?

34:49.455 --> 34:51.855
Yeah, it helped me
keep some of my staff on

34:51.990 --> 34:53.523
And buy some
supplies for takeout.

34:53.559 --> 34:59.929
And you also
spent $4,499.99

34:59.965 --> 35:02.732
On ruffoni opus cupra
hand hammered copper pans,

35:02.801 --> 35:03.800
Is that correct?

35:03.802 --> 35:04.935
That was for a tv
show appearance.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.669
Avery:
<i> For which you also</i>
<i> spent $1,000</i>

35:06.738 --> 35:08.271
On hair, makeup
and wardrobe.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.373
Ben:
<i> It was for a dinner that I</i>
<i> cooked at a homeless shelter.</i>

35:10.375 --> 35:12.909
I donated my time while the
restaurant was shut down.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.013
Mr. Sangster,

35:17.082 --> 35:19.148
Correct me if I'm wrong,

35:19.184 --> 35:21.083
<i> You got every government</i>
<i> subsidy going.</i>

35:21.120 --> 35:24.554
<i> You splurged on equipment,</i>
<i> on hair and makeup supplies,</i>

35:24.623 --> 35:27.223
And in all that time you
didn't pay one cent in rent.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.758
How was I paying?
I was shut down.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.727
Avery:
<i> And when your landlord</i>
<i> came to talk to you</i>

35:30.796 --> 35:32.428
About paying that rent,

35:32.464 --> 35:33.496
You attacked him.

35:33.498 --> 35:34.798
No, that's-
-<i> you put your hands</i>

35:34.800 --> 35:36.966
On this 70-year-old man.

35:37.035 --> 35:39.468
<i> You grabbed him by the</i>
<i> collar and you shoved him.</i>

35:41.706 --> 35:43.105
<i> Isn't that right,</i>
<i> mr. Sangster?</i>

35:43.142 --> 35:48.178
(intense music)

35:48.247 --> 35:51.181
I've known you for
ten years, man.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.983
<i> If you were in trouble,</i>
<i> why didn't you tell me?</i>

35:52.985 --> 35:54.951
You didn't have to
be such a hard-ass.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.522
Avery:
<i> No further questions,</i>
<i> your honour.</i>

35:59.591 --> 36:03.593
(soft dramatic music)

36:03.662 --> 36:04.995
(avery sighs)

36:06.031 --> 36:08.130
Ellery:
<i> My mother always says,</i>

36:08.167 --> 36:10.800
<i> "wearing a badge is like</i>
<i> having a heartbeat."</i>

36:10.802 --> 36:12.401
Which is to say,
that your timesheet

36:12.437 --> 36:13.903
Doesn't dictate your duty.

36:13.939 --> 36:16.939
Marcie:
<i> Here are the facts</i>
<i> that we can all agree on.</i>

36:16.975 --> 36:19.976
Percy lincoln was out
shopping late at night

36:20.111 --> 36:23.279
And saw two women being
harassed by three men.

36:23.415 --> 36:26.049
Ellery:
<i> Even though these</i>
<i> officers were off-duty,</i>

36:26.051 --> 36:29.085
They saw a crime in progress
and decided to intervene.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.921
Marcie:
<i> One of the men had</i>
<i> his hands on a woman,</i>

36:31.056 --> 36:32.422
Roughing her up.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.358
Ellery:
<i> Percy lincoln inserted</i>
<i> himself into the situation.</i>

36:35.394 --> 36:36.692
Imagine that was you.

36:36.828 --> 36:39.095
<i> Would you make the easier</i>
<i>decision and just shrug it off?</i>

36:39.164 --> 36:40.763
A man coming to the
defence of a woman.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.932
