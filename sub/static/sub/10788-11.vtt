09:17.583 --> 09:18.041
SHE WAS,
LIKE, SO CUTE.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.917
AW.

09:19.917 --> 09:21.708
BUT YOU HAVEN'T PUT
THE BABY GATE UP YET

09:21.708 --> 09:22.667
ON THE STAIRS.

09:22.667 --> 09:25.125
HONEY, I WILL.
OK.

09:25.125 --> 09:28.041
HAVE YOU MET
YOUR NEW NEIGHBORS YET?

09:28.041 --> 09:30.625
YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE
THAT BOUGHT
YOUR OLD HOUSE,

09:30.625 --> 09:31.708
THEY JUST USE IT
AS A SUMMER PLACE.

09:31.708 --> 09:34.500
IT'S BEEN
BOARDED UP THE REST
OF THE YEAR.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.291
IT'S SORT OF SAD
TO THINK OF THAT HOUSE
ALL COBWEBBY.

09:37.291 --> 09:39.583
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

09:39.583 --> 09:40.959
OH, EXCUSE ME.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.834
HELLO?

09:47.500 --> 09:50.667
NO, IT'S STILL LEAKING?

09:50.667 --> 09:53.583
WELL, NO, I KINDA NEED
TO GET IT FIXED...

09:53.583 --> 09:56.417
WAIT, THE PLUMBER
HASN'T FIXED THE LEAK
AT THE RESTAURANT YET?

09:56.417 --> 09:58.417
LIKE NOW.

09:58.417 --> 09:59.583
GIVE ME THAT.

09:59.583 --> 10:03.458
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE THAT
FIXED LAST WEEK.

10:03.458 --> 10:06.166
NO. MEET ME THERE
IN 15 MINUTES.

10:06.166 --> 10:07.166
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.417
HONEY, YOU JUST GOT HERE.
STAY WITH JEN.

10:09.417 --> 10:11.750
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, OK?

10:11.750 --> 10:12.792
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:12.792 --> 10:13.792
OK.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.875
SO, UH,

10:19.875 --> 10:22.333
YOU TWO
ARE DATING NOW.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.375
AH, MY FAVORITE
OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE
FRESHMAN.

11:30.375 --> 11:32.917
UH, I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO THE LIBRARY.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.708
THAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF CAMPUS.

11:34.708 --> 11:36.667
NO WONDER
I COULDN'T FIND IT.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.166
HEH HEH HEH.

11:38.166 --> 11:39.875
HOW'D YOU DO?

11:39.875 --> 11:43.250
UH, SO FAR, 4 As.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.417
I BET YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THIS.

11:45.417 --> 11:46.500
OH.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.125
OH? OH WHAT?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.041
OH, MY? OH, CRAP?

11:50.041 --> 11:52.417
OH, GIVE ME THAT
RIGHT THIS SECOND

11:52.417 --> 11:53.875
BEFORE I JUMP OUT
OF MY SKIN?

11:53.875 --> 11:55.333
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT
THE RESULTS

11:55.333 --> 11:56.375
OF MONTHS' WORTH
OF SWEAT AND LABOR,

11:56.375 --> 11:58.708
AND "OH"
IS ALL YOU CAN SAY
FOR YOURSELF?

11:58.708 --> 12:01.375
YOU'RE HAVING
WAY TOO MUCH FUN HERE.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.208
JOB PERK.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.708
OH, MY GOD.

12:24.708 --> 12:26.625
I TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA CONTEST THE GRADE?

12:26.625 --> 12:28.208
NO.
HEH HEH HEH.

12:28.208 --> 12:29.291
YOU DESERVE IT.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.875
A HUG?!
WHAT KIND OF HUG?

12:46.875 --> 12:48.166
IT WAS JUST A HUG.

12:48.166 --> 12:51.417
I'M SORRY, BUT HUGGING
THE MOST GORGEOUS MAN
ON CAMPUS

12:51.417 --> 12:52.917
COULD NEVER BE
JUST A HUG.

12:52.917 --> 12:54.166
HOW LONG
DID IT LAST?

12:54.166 --> 12:55.583
I DON'T KNOW.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.625
OK, EXACTLY
AND PRECISELY,

12:57.625 --> 12:59.208
WHICH BODY PARTS
MADE CONTACT

12:59.208 --> 12:59.792
AND WHERE?

12:59.792 --> 13:02.625
OK, WE HAD SEX.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.291
REALLY?

13:04.291 --> 13:06.583
RIGHT THERE
IN THE BURSAR'S OFFICE
ON THE FORMICA.

13:06.583 --> 13:09.792
IT WAS WILD, PASSIONATE,
HOT, ANIMALISTIC SEX.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.041
I HATE YOU.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.959
IT WAS A HUG.
I WAS EXCITED.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.250
IT WAS AN EXCITED HUG,
SO NO BIG DEAL.

13:17.250 --> 13:18.625
NO KISSING AT ALL?
YOU SWEAR?

13:18.625 --> 13:21.708
AUDREY, OF COURSE NOT.

13:21.708 --> 13:24.792
OK, WELL, THE FACT THAT
YOU CAN AT LEAST HUG
PROFESSOR WILDER

13:24.792 --> 13:26.875
PROVES THAT THERE'S
STILL HOPE FOR YOU YET.

13:26.875 --> 13:27.917
GOOD TO KNOW.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.792
THIS IS OUR NIGHT,
JOEY POTTER.

13:29.792 --> 13:31.250
WE'RE GONNA CELEBRATE.
WE'RE GONNA CUT LOOSE.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.458
TONIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
KISS SOME BOYS.

13:33.458 --> 13:34.458
WHICH BOYS?

13:34.458 --> 13:37.500
OH, HI. EXCUSE ME.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.792
I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND
A LITTLE BIT FORWARD,
BUT, UM,

13:39.792 --> 13:43.333
WOULD YOU KISS
MY FRIEND HERE?

13:45.625 --> 13:46.959
OK.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.792
UH, YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE
TO MAKE OUT WITH YOU, BUT...

13:49.792 --> 13:50.917
UNTIL MY TONGUE
COMPLETELY HEALS,

13:50.917 --> 13:54.458
I--I JUST THINK
IT'S TOO RISKY.

13:54.458 --> 13:58.208
THERE WAS A PIERCING
INCIDENT WITH--

13:58.208 --> 13:59.291
IT WAS BAD.

13:59.959 --> 14:02.291
HEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH.

14:02.291 --> 14:03.500
AAH!

14:03.500 --> 14:05.708
HEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.917
I WANNA TALK TO YOU,
WITTER.

14:10.917 --> 14:13.250
DON'T WORRY.
I ALREADY TOLD AUDREY
NOT TO SHOW UP

14:13.250 --> 14:14.625
LOOKING LIKE A SHOWGIRL
TOMORROW TO WORK.

14:14.625 --> 14:15.542
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I LIKE AUDREY.

14:15.542 --> 14:17.708
SHE'S A GOOD HIRE.
THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

14:17.708 --> 14:20.000
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.917
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
I MEANT TO TELL YOU
ABOUT THOSE LOBSTERS.

14:21.917 --> 14:24.000
I REALLY DID. IT JUST
SLIPPED MY MIND.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.583
IT'S BEEN ALMOST 6 MONTHS
SINCE YOU DRAGGED YOUR
SORRY ASS IN HERE,

14:25.583 --> 14:27.750
AND SINCE THEN,
YOU'VE LEARNED EVERYTHING
FROM APPLES TO ZUCCHINIS

14:27.750 --> 14:30.125
AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.667
MAYBE YOU COULD
JUST CUT TO THE CHASE
AND TELL ME WHAT I DID.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.166
YOU IMPRESSED ME.

14:33.166 --> 14:36.625
WELL, GENERALLY,
THAT'S CONSIDERED
A GOOD THING.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.959
INDEED IT IS,
AND SOMETHING THAT
IS TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TO DO.

14:39.959 --> 14:41.834
SO THEN YOU'RE NOT
CHEWING ME OUT.

14:41.834 --> 14:43.083
NO. I'M PROMOTING YOU.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.667
WHICH MEANS I'M GIVING YOU
A 20% INCREASE IN YOUR SALARY.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.875
OK, YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE
THE LOOK OF SHOCK
ON MY FACE,

14:48.875 --> 14:49.792
BUT I'M SHOCKED.

14:49.792 --> 14:52.542
YEAH? WELL,
WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.250
YOU'VE DONE
A TREMENDOUS JOB, PACEY.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.959
I KNEW YOU HAD THE TALENT
WHEN YOU WALKED IN HERE,

14:55.959 --> 14:58.333
BUT I WASN'T SURE
YOU HAD THE CHARACTER
TO SEE IT THROUGH.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.708
IT'S GOOD WORK.

14:59.708 --> 15:01.708
OK, SERIOUSLY.
IS THERE A NOTE
IN HERE THAT SAYS

15:01.708 --> 15:02.667
"I'M SCREWIN'
WITH YOU, WITTER"?

15:02.667 --> 15:04.333
ABSOLUTELY.
SEVERAL NOTES. C-NOTES.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.041
YOU NEVER CAME TO PICK UP
YOUR HOLIDAY BONUS.

15:07.041 --> 15:08.708
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS
A HOLIDAY BONUS.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.000
HAPPY BELATED HOLIDAYS,
CHEF WITTER.

15:13.583 --> 15:14.542
I'M GLAD YOU STAYED.

15:14.542 --> 15:17.708
THANKS, DANNY.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.041
UM, I'LL TALK TO YOU
TOMORROW.

15:20.041 --> 15:21.708
WITTER.
YEAH.

15:21.708 --> 15:24.125
WHAT IS IT
YOU WANTED TO TELL ME
ABOUT THE LOBSTERS?

15:33.417 --> 15:34.750
GOD, I LOVE COLLEGE LIFE.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.583
WHY WOULD I EVER WANT
TO LEAVE ALL THIS?

15:36.583 --> 15:38.875
BECAUSE AT SOME POINT,
YOU HAVE TO PAY OFF
ALL THE LOANS

15:38.875 --> 15:40.375
YOU'RE USING TO FINANCE
ALL OF THIS.

15:40.375 --> 15:43.333
OK. NO, THERE WILL BE
NO PRAGMATISM TONIGHT.
I'LL HAVE NONE OF IT.

15:43.333 --> 15:46.458
ONLY IRRATIONAL, RECKLESS
FLIGHTS OF FANCY.

15:46.458 --> 15:47.583
OOH. SPEAKING OF WHICH,

15:47.583 --> 15:50.583
NOW, THERE IS
A HIGHLY KISSABLE BOY.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.417
HE'S CUTE.

15:53.417 --> 15:54.667
CUTE?

15:54.667 --> 15:57.458
COME ON, JOEY.
THAT GUY IS GORGEOUS.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.708
OK, HE'S GORGEOUS
AND...

16:02.708 --> 16:03.834
FAMILIAR.

16:03.834 --> 16:05.959
WE HAVE TO PLOT
SOME SMART, SUBTLE WAY

16:05.959 --> 16:07.458
FOR YOU TO MEET HIM.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.000
HOW ABOUT I GO UP
TO HIM AND SAY,
"AREN'T YOU CHARLIE,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.458
THE GUY WHO
DICKED OVER JEN?"

16:13.458 --> 16:15.667
THAT'S CHARLIE?
CHARLIE THE JERK?

16:16.625 --> 16:18.792
IN THE FLESH.

16:18.792 --> 16:21.125
OOH, SUCH BEAUTIFUL FLESH
FOR A JERK.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.542
JEN HAS GOOD TASTE
IN MEN.

16:22.542 --> 16:25.041
I MEAN...

16:25.041 --> 16:27.834
MUSICIANS, YOU KNOW?
THESE GUYS ROCK.

16:27.834 --> 16:29.208
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

16:29.208 --> 16:31.250
NO, REALLY. I MEAN,
THEY'VE GOTTEN BETTER.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.375
I WONDER IF THEY REMEMBER ME
FROM WHEN I SANG WITH THEM.

16:32.375 --> 16:33.750
WELL, YOU'RE VERY HARD
TO FORGET, AUDREY.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.041
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

16:36.041 --> 16:37.041
THERE ARE
FEW THINGS IN LIFE
I'M MORE CERTAIN OF.

16:37.041 --> 16:39.500
I'M GONNA GO
TALK TO THEM, OK?

16:39.500 --> 16:40.208
GOOD LUCK.

16:54.959 --> 16:56.500
RA!
[GASPS]

16:56.500 --> 16:57.917
HA HA HA HA.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.667
SO, THIS IS WHERE
ALL THE BEAUTIFUL,
SMART GIRLS HANG OUT, HUH?

16:59.667 --> 17:00.667
I GOTTA START GOING
TO THESE COLLEGE CLUBS
MORE OFTEN.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.333
YOU GOT MY MESSAGE?

17:03.333 --> 17:06.583
I DID INDEED. A 4.0.
I'M SURE YOU'LL DO BETTER
NEXT SEMESTER, JO.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.458
I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO JOIN US.

17:08.458 --> 17:09.666
WELL, I HAVE SOMETHING
TO CELEBRATE TONIGHT.

17:09.666 --> 17:10.791
I GOT A PROMOTION.

17:10.791 --> 17:13.541
THAT'S AWESOME.

17:13.541 --> 17:16.208
HEY,

17:16.208 --> 17:17.834
I KNOW THAT VOICE.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.000
AUDREY'S EXCITED
ABOUT HER NEW JOB,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.125
AND WHEN
AUDREY'S EXCITED
ABOUT SOMETHING...

17:21.125 --> 17:22.333
HOW DID WE EVER GET
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL
WITHOUT THAT GIRL?

17:35.875 --> 17:39.291
YOU KNOW, HE JUST--

17:39.291 --> 17:41.875
HE LOVES YOU
AND THIS FAMILY

17:41.875 --> 17:44.375
AND THIS HOUSE
SO MUCH THAT...

17:44.375 --> 17:47.458
SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF IT DOESN'T
HOLD HIM BACK

17:47.458 --> 17:50.542
FROM MOVING FORWARD
WITH HIS LIFE.

17:50.542 --> 17:52.500
WELL, HE SEEMS
TO BE MOVING FORWARD

17:52.500 --> 17:53.625
WITH PARTS OF HIS LIFE
JUST FINE.

17:53.625 --> 17:56.917
PARTS THAT
YOU AREN'T ENTIRELY
PLEASED ABOUT.

17:56.917 --> 17:59.417
AM I THAT TRANSPARENT?

17:59.417 --> 18:03.959
EVERYTHING
IS REALLY NICE
BETWEEN US, GALE.

18:03.959 --> 18:06.917
I REALLY JUST AM
KIND OF CRAZY
ABOUT HIM,

18:06.917 --> 18:10.250
AND I WANT HIM
TO BE HAPPY.

18:10.250 --> 18:13.375
WELL, THEN WE BOTH WANT
THE SAME THINGS.

18:14.792 --> 18:17.250
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF HE MOVED INTO
GRAMS' ATTIC?

18:18.583 --> 18:21.208
WELL, I WOULD MISS
HAVING HIM AROUND HERE,

18:21.208 --> 18:22.583
BUT, UM,

18:22.583 --> 18:26.333
I KNOW THAT HE NEEDS
TO GET A PLACE OF HIS OWN.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.208
HAS HE TOLD YOU ABOUT
THIS, UM,

18:28.208 --> 18:30.750
FILM SCHOOL IN BOSTON
THAT HE'S BEEN
LOOKING INTO?

18:30.750 --> 18:32.083
NO, HE DIDN'T MENTION IT.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.083
EVERY TIME
I BRING UP SCHOOL,

18:34.083 --> 18:36.834
HE CONVENIENTLY CHANGES
THE SUBJECT,

18:36.834 --> 18:38.834
BUT I WOULD LOVE IT
IF HE WENT BACK TO SCHOOL.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.417
ME, TOO.

18:40.417 --> 18:42.166
SO, HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT IT?

18:42.166 --> 18:45.250
HMM, WELL, I'VE DANCED
AROUND THE SUBJECT.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.125
OH, NO, HONEY.
YOU CAN'T DANCE,

18:47.125 --> 18:48.792
YOU GOTTA REALLY TELL HIM.

18:48.792 --> 18:51.792
I'M JUST AFRAID
OF PUSHING HIM
INTO SOMETHING

18:51.792 --> 18:52.625
THAT'S HE'S NOT
READY FOR.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.750
NO, NO. JEN,
DAWSON HAS INHERITED

18:55.750 --> 18:58.500
A STUBBORN STREAK
A MILE LONG FROM HIS FATHER.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.000
TRUST ME.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.625
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO PUSH HIM.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.792
I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

19:10.792 --> 19:12.583
THAT WE DON'T HAVE
TO KISS.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.959
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
THAT, UH--

19:14.959 --> 19:17.041
WELL, HI, UM,

19:17.041 --> 19:18.375
MY NAME IS TOM.

19:18.375 --> 19:20.417
I'M SURE YOU'RE
A REALLY SWEET GUY,

19:20.417 --> 19:23.417
AND PROBABLY
A WORLD-CLASS
MACKING MASTER,

19:23.417 --> 19:24.708
BUT MY FRIEND
OVER THERE,

19:24.708 --> 19:25.834
SHE REALLY
NEEDS TO RETURN
TO THE MOTHERSHIP.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.375
NO HARD FEELINGS?

19:31.834 --> 19:33.708
Man: CAN I BUY YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

19:33.708 --> 19:36.083
CLEARLY, SUBTEXT
AND HUMOR HAVE NO EFFECT
ON STUPIDITY.

19:36.083 --> 19:39.333
WOULD YOU PLEASE
LEAVE ME--

19:39.333 --> 19:40.417
NICE.

19:40.417 --> 19:42.458
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD BANDY

19:42.458 --> 19:43.291
ABOUT WORDS
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?

19:43.291 --> 19:47.000
STOP. JUST STOP.
STOP WHAT?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.375
THE CASTRATING SHREW ROUTINE.
THE DEFENSE MECHANISM.

19:49.375 --> 19:51.375
LOOK, I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND

19:51.375 --> 19:54.667
HOW A GIRL WHO LOOKS
LIKE YOU NEEDS ONE,

19:54.667 --> 19:56.875
BUT YOU CAN DROP IT
AROUND ME.

19:56.875 --> 19:59.125
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS MEET YOU

19:59.125 --> 19:59.500
AND TALK A LITTLE.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.834
OK. FINE. I'LL START.

20:03.834 --> 20:06.291
HI. I'M CHARLIE.

20:11.417 --> 20:12.917
CHARLIE,

20:12.917 --> 20:14.583
HOW ABOUT WE TALK
ABOUT WHY,

20:14.583 --> 20:19.250
OUT OF ALL
OF THESE GIRLS
IN THE ENTIRE CLUB,

20:19.250 --> 20:21.458
I'M THE BLESSED ONE.
I MEAN...

20:21.458 --> 20:24.792
WHAT IS IT ABOUT ME
THAT PIQUED
YOUR INTEREST?

20:24.792 --> 20:27.834
IT'S THE HAIR-BEHIND-
THE-EAR THING.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.708
YOU KNOW,

20:29.708 --> 20:32.166
THAT LITTLE TUCK YOU DO.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.250
LOOK. SOMETIMES,

20:36.250 --> 20:39.000
WHEN I'M HAVING
A TOUGH NIGHT,

20:39.000 --> 20:40.875
I LOOK OUT
INTO THE AUDIENCE

20:40.875 --> 20:42.500
FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S REALLY LISTENING.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.750
IT MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE I'M CONNECTING.

20:45.750 --> 20:48.375
AND I SAW YOU,

20:48.375 --> 20:49.792
STANDING
NEXT TO YOUR FRIEND,

20:49.792 --> 20:51.417
STARING AT ME.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.041
AND...

20:53.041 --> 20:55.792
I NOTICED THE WAY

20:55.792 --> 20:59.792
YOU KEPT TUCKING YOUR HAIR
BEHIND YOUR EARS,

20:59.792 --> 21:01.375
LIKE YOU WERE TRYING
EXTRA-HARD TO LISTEN.

21:03.417 --> 21:04.333
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

21:04.333 --> 21:08.959
I WANT TO MEET
THAT BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

21:11.625 --> 21:14.458
SO TELL ME.

21:14.458 --> 21:17.083
DOES THIS SORT OF THING
ACTUALLY WORK?

21:17.083 --> 21:19.291
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

21:19.291 --> 21:22.166
I'M NOT LIKE
THE REST OF THESE PRE-EPOCH
NEANDERTHALS IN THIS PLACE.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.125
NO?

21:23.125 --> 21:25.333
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

21:25.333 --> 21:26.667
REALLY?

21:26.667 --> 21:28.250
YEAH.

21:31.083 --> 21:35.083
SO, YOU MUST'VE USED
A DIFFERENT TACT WITH
JEN LINDLEY, HUH?

21:39.625 --> 21:40.625
HMM.

21:41.792 --> 21:44.708
JOEY,

21:44.708 --> 21:45.875
THE SMART GIRL
FROM WORTHINGTON.

21:45.875 --> 21:47.291
CHARLIE,

21:47.291 --> 21:49.250
WOMANIZER
FROM BOSTON BAY.

21:49.250 --> 21:52.125
THIS IS DEEPLY HUMILIATING.

21:52.125 --> 21:53.417
MM.

21:53.417 --> 21:56.667
HEY, YOU CAN'T BLAME A GUY
FOR TRYING.

21:56.667 --> 21:57.917
NO,

21:57.917 --> 21:59.583
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO HAVE A DRINK
WITH HIM.

22:07.667 --> 22:10.583
ANY INTEREST
IN SOME MAKE-UP SEX?

22:10.583 --> 22:11.583
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

22:11.583 --> 22:13.000
YOU LOOK PRETTY
WIPED OUT, PAL.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.417
OHH!

22:14.417 --> 22:17.333
I DON'T THINK
YOU'D BE UP FOR IT.

22:18.542 --> 22:21.333
I'M AN 18-YEAR-OLD GUY
WHO JUST LOST HIS VIRGINITY.

22:21.333 --> 22:24.625
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
AT WHAT I'M UP FOR.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.500
HOW WAS YOUR EVENING?

22:29.500 --> 22:32.166
WELL...

22:32.166 --> 22:34.375
MOST OF IT WAS SPENT
TALKING TO YOUR MOM.

22:34.375 --> 22:35.500
ANY STRANGENESS?

22:35.500 --> 22:36.708
A LITTLE, BUT...

22:36.708 --> 22:38.208
I THINK THAT
ONCE SHE REALIZED

22:38.208 --> 22:39.041
I WAS AFTER YOU
FOR MORE THAN YOUR BODY,

22:39.041 --> 22:41.583
SHE LIGHTENED UP.

22:41.583 --> 22:44.708
PLEASE TELL ME THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT.

22:44.708 --> 22:47.500
WE TALKED ABOUT YOU...

22:47.500 --> 22:49.375
MOVING TO BOSTON.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.333
A CERTAIN ATTIC
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT,

22:53.333 --> 22:54.500
AN ATTIC THAT WOULD BE

22:54.500 --> 22:57.125
A REALLY GREAT PLACE
FOR YOU TO STUDY.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.750
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN
THINKIN' SERIOUSLY
ABOUT THAT,

23:02.750 --> 23:03.583
BUT RIGHT NOW...

23:03.583 --> 23:05.959
IT'S JUST NOT
THE RIGHT TIME.

23:05.959 --> 23:07.250
ACTUALLY, IT IS,

23:07.250 --> 23:08.375
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO FEELS THAT WAY.

23:08.375 --> 23:11.708
OK, WHEN DID
YOU AND MY MOM

23:11.708 --> 23:12.750
SUDDENLY BECOME
CLOSE ENOUGH

23:12.750 --> 23:13.959
TO START
TRADING INSIGHTS

23:13.959 --> 23:15.041
ABOUT WHAT'S BEST
FOR MY LIFE?

23:15.041 --> 23:16.375
[SIGHS]

23:16.375 --> 23:18.000
SWEETIE, YOU'RE
NOT REQUIRED TO BE
THE HUSBAND.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.208
FAMILIES
ARE COMPLICATED.

23:19.208 --> 23:20.417
IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE.

23:20.417 --> 23:21.667
YOU THINK THAT
I DON'T KNOW THAT?

23:21.667 --> 23:23.250
WELL, YOU HAVE
TO ADMIT YOU'RE
NOT THE BEST PERSON

23:23.250 --> 23:25.417
IN THE WORLD TO BE
GIVING ME ADVICE
ON PARENTS.

23:25.417 --> 23:26.333
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

23:26.333 --> 23:27.875
I'M JUST STATING
THE FACTS, JEN.

23:27.875 --> 23:28.875
I MEAN, HOW CAN
YOU GIVE ME ADVICE

23:28.875 --> 23:29.875
ABOUT HOW TO DEAL
WITH MY MOTHER

23:29.875 --> 23:32.583
WHEN YOU DON'T
EVEN TALK TO YOURS?

23:32.583 --> 23:35.041
I APPRECIATE
HOW MUCH YOU CARE
ABOUT...MY LIFE,

23:35.041 --> 23:37.041
BUT...IF YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT HOW

23:37.041 --> 23:40.000
I SHOULD LIVE IT,
WE SHOULD FIND
A DIFFERENT SUBJECT.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.250
I ACTUALLY DON'T REALLY
WANT TO TALK TO YOU
AT ALL RIGHT NOW.

23:49.625 --> 23:51.208
[SIGHS]

24:04.250 --> 24:05.375
HEY!

24:05.375 --> 24:07.250
DO YOU MIND?
WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE
A GAME HERE.

24:07.250 --> 24:08.375
YEAH.

24:08.375 --> 24:10.208
WE'RE
TRYING TO HAVE
A GAME HERE.

24:10.208 --> 24:11.375
WHAT
AN ANNOYANCE.

24:11.375 --> 24:13.125
OH, YES, I CAN SEE
HOW ANNOYED YOU ARE.

24:13.125 --> 24:14.583
OK.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.083
YOU RACK THEM,
I'LL CRACK THEM, BABY.

24:24.083 --> 24:25.917
HEY!

24:25.917 --> 24:27.667
HI. DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY AGAINST HER?

24:27.667 --> 24:29.959
AH...NO. I'LL
LET YOU ENJOY
THE INDIGNITY.

24:29.959 --> 24:32.041
THANK YOU.

24:33.291 --> 24:36.542
SO, TELL ME,
HOW LONG AFTER
WE LEFT YOUR ROOM TODAY

24:36.542 --> 24:38.708
DID YOU RUN DOWN
TO THE BURSAR'S OFFICE
TO CHECK ON YOUR GRADES?

24:40.792 --> 24:41.834
OK, I'M
AN OBSESSIVE FREAK,

24:41.834 --> 24:44.792
I FREELY ADMIT IT.
THERE IS NO HOPE FOR ME.

24:44.792 --> 24:46.291
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

24:46.291 --> 24:48.125
THERE IS A PART OF YOU
THAT KNOWS HOW TO LET LOOSE.

24:48.125 --> 24:49.875
YOU JUST HAVE TO...

24:49.875 --> 24:51.625
LET HER LOOSE
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

24:51.625 --> 24:53.834
WHAT PART?

24:53.834 --> 24:55.041
THE OTHER JOEY.

24:55.041 --> 24:56.208
THE CAREFREE GIRL
WHO KNOWS HOW TO DRINK

24:56.208 --> 24:58.291
AND PLAY STRIP POKER

24:58.291 --> 25:00.583
AND GO AWAY ON A SAILBOAT
FOR A SUMMER.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.625
THE GIRL WHO CAN GET UP
IN FRONT OF A CROWD
OF COMPLETE STRANGERS

25:05.625 --> 25:07.500
AND SING AT A BEAUTY PAGEANT.

25:09.792 --> 25:10.750
OTHER JOEY?

25:10.750 --> 25:11.959
YES, THE OTHER JOEY.

25:11.959 --> 25:13.166
THE GIRL WHO KNOWS BETTER
THAN TO LET THINGS

25:13.166 --> 25:17.000
THAT ARE COMPLETELY
OUT OF HER CONTROL
BOTHER HER.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.250
LIKE DAWSON AND JEN.

25:20.917 --> 25:22.125
HEY, GUYS!

25:22.125 --> 25:23.125
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY ELSE
I LOVE POOL?

25:23.125 --> 25:26.041
BECAUSE THE CHALK
MATCHES MY EYE SHADOW!

25:26.041 --> 25:27.375
HOW CUTE IS THAT?

25:29.250 --> 25:31.959
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'M GONNA HEAD OVER
TO THE BAR, AND, UH,

25:31.959 --> 25:34.291
I'M GONNA
KEEP MY EYES OPEN
FOR THAT OTHER GIRL.

25:34.291 --> 25:35.917
RIGHT. WELL, IF YOU
SEE THAT GIRL,

25:35.917 --> 25:37.166
WOULD YOU BUY HER A DRINK?

25:37.166 --> 25:38.291
ACTUALLY, WILL YOU
BUY ALL OF US A DRINK,

25:38.291 --> 25:39.417
ON ME?

25:39.417 --> 25:41.333
SURE.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.500
WOW, WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS KIND
OF MONEY?

25:43.500 --> 25:44.708
WELL...I WORK FOR A LIVING.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.291
I BELIEVE THIS
IS WHAT YOU'RE DRINKING.

25:52.291 --> 25:53.375
YOU AGAIN?

25:53.375 --> 25:54.708
HEY, WHAT CAN I SAY?
I DON'T GIVE UP EASILY.

25:54.708 --> 25:55.834
YOU KNOW, HELPING
A GIRL GET A DRINK

25:55.834 --> 25:58.375
DOESN'T ABSOLVE YOU
FROM CHEATING ON HER FRIEND.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.291
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR
ABSOLUTION.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.041
I'M LOOKING FOR
A SECOND CHANCE.

26:02.041 --> 26:03.625
WELL, JEN IS NOT
CURRENTLY SWIMMING

26:03.625 --> 26:05.041
IN THE AVAILABLE POOL
RIGHT NOW.

26:05.041 --> 26:05.708
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD.

26:05.708 --> 26:07.792
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT YOU.

26:07.792 --> 26:09.375
A SECOND CHANCE WITH ME?

26:09.375 --> 26:11.083
I HADN'T REALIZED
YOU EVER HAD A FIRST.

26:11.083 --> 26:12.792
WHAT EXACTLY DID I DO
THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE?

26:12.792 --> 26:15.667
ALL RIGHT, I HIT ON YOU.
IS THAT A CRIME?

26:15.667 --> 26:16.708
PLEASE!

26:16.708 --> 26:19.208
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I'M GUILTY OF,

26:19.208 --> 26:21.542
IT'S SIMPLY BEING
ATTRACTED TO YOU.

26:21.542 --> 26:23.875
I NEVER SAID
ANYTHING TO YOU
THAT I DIDN'T MEAN.

26:23.875 --> 26:24.875
I THINK YOU
ARE  BEAUTIFUL,
AND TRUTH BE TOLD,

26:24.875 --> 26:27.083
I THINK YOU'RE
DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS.

26:28.083 --> 26:29.750
WHAT, THE WHOLE
"I'M JUST A BASS PLAYER

26:29.750 --> 26:31.750
YOU CAN TAKE HOME TO MAMA"
THING DIDN'T WORK,

26:31.750 --> 26:34.458
SO NOW YOU'RE USING
SIMPLE FLATTERY?

26:34.458 --> 26:36.417
OK, SO I MADE A FOOL
OUT OF MYSELF BEFORE.

26:36.417 --> 26:38.750
THAT I'M PREPARED TO DO.

26:38.750 --> 26:41.041
WELL, GOOD. BECAUSE YOU
DISPLAY QUITE A MASTERY

26:41.041 --> 26:42.333
AT THAT PARTICULAR SKILL.

26:42.333 --> 26:43.750
GIVE ME AS MUCH CRAP
AS YOU WANT.

26:43.750 --> 26:45.417
AT LEAST I'M NOT AFRAID
TO TAKE A CHANCE.

26:45.417 --> 26:46.917
WHAT, ARE YOU
IMPLYING THAT I AM?

26:46.917 --> 26:48.417
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU TOOK ONE?

26:48.417 --> 26:49.583
WELL, THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

26:49.583 --> 26:52.083
DO THEY TEACH
CLASSES IN UPTIGHT
AT WORTHINGTON,

26:52.083 --> 26:54.625
OR IS IT JUST
A PREREQUISITE
FOR ADMISSION?

26:54.625 --> 26:55.583
I'M NOT UPTIGHT.

26:55.583 --> 26:56.708
THEN WHY WON'T YOU
TELL ME WHEN

26:56.708 --> 26:58.834
THE LAST TIME WAS
YOU TOOK A CHANCE?

26:58.834 --> 27:00.375
BECAUSE I'M NOT
GOING TO RECOUNT

27:00.375 --> 27:02.250
MY RECKLESS BEHAVIOR
FOR YOU.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.375
I BET THERE'S
NOT MUCH TO RECOUNT.

27:03.375 --> 27:05.959
BUT I'LL BET THE LIST
OF PRUDISH PERFECTIONISM

27:05.959 --> 27:07.959
GOES ON AND ON,
AD NAUSEAM.

27:08.333 --> 27:10.500
COME ON.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.000
JOEY...

27:12.000 --> 27:13.125
THE SMART GIRL
FROM WORTHINGTON,

27:13.125 --> 27:15.333
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU DID SOMETHING

27:15.333 --> 27:17.959
COMPLETELY
AND INDISPUTABLY WILD?

27:24.542 --> 27:26.625
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOIN' UP?

27:26.625 --> 27:30.041
OH, I THOUGHT
I'D COME OUT
AND GET SOME AIR.

27:30.041 --> 27:31.583
AND HAVE A LITTLE...

27:31.583 --> 27:33.959
HEART-TO-HEART
WITH YOUR SON?

27:33.959 --> 27:35.458
OH, I'M GETTING
REALLY BAD

27:35.458 --> 27:37.625
AT KEEPING
MY FEELINGS HIDDEN
IN MY OLD AGE.

27:37.625 --> 27:38.875
YOU'RE NOT OLD.

27:40.166 --> 27:41.708
IT'S FUNNY.

27:41.708 --> 27:42.792
BEFORE YOU
GOT HERE TODAY,

27:42.792 --> 27:44.792
I WAS ALL WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON

27:44.792 --> 27:47.375
IN MY HOUSE AFTER
I WENT TO SLEEP TONIGHT,
AND...

27:47.375 --> 27:50.083
NOW I SEEM TO BE
A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT'S NOT GOING ON.

27:52.583 --> 27:56.583
WE HAD OUR
FIRST FIGHT, I GUESS.
WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.375
UNTIL YOU REALLY
LET GO OF THIS HOUSE,

27:59.375 --> 28:01.166
I DON'T THINK YOU WILL.

28:01.166 --> 28:04.333
NO, DAWSON, UNTIL YOU
CAN START WAKING UP
EVERY DAY

28:04.333 --> 28:06.000
AND THINKING ABOUT
YOURSELF,

28:06.000 --> 28:06.917
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
EVER GONNA BE ABLE TO...

28:06.917 --> 28:09.542
BE IN A RELATIONSHIP
AND GO TO SCHOOL

28:09.542 --> 28:11.500
AND BEGIN THE LIFE THAT
YOU DESERVE TO HAVE.

28:11.500 --> 28:12.792
ALL RIGHT, MOM,
I PLAN ON DOING
ALL THOSE THINGS.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.083
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT YOU AND LILLY
ARE SET FIRST.

28:15.083 --> 28:17.208
YOU ARE DONE.
RIGHT NOW.

28:17.208 --> 28:19.041
THIS IS WHERE
IT ENDS.

28:19.041 --> 28:20.792
MOM...

28:20.792 --> 28:22.000
NO.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.166
IT'S TIME.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.250
LOOK, I AM
PROBABLY MORE GUILTY
THAN YOU KNOW.

28:25.250 --> 28:28.333
I MEAN, THERE'S PART
OF ME THAT HAS LOVED
HAVING YOU AROUND,

28:28.333 --> 28:29.834
BUT IT'S JUST NOT FAIR,

28:29.834 --> 28:31.208
AND IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT,

28:31.208 --> 28:33.375
AND SEEING YOU TONIGHT
WITH JEN,

28:33.375 --> 28:34.708
AND REALIZING HOW MUCH
SHE WANTS YOU IN BOSTON,

28:34.708 --> 28:36.542
IT'S MADE IT
ALL CLEAR TO ME.

28:36.542 --> 28:40.250
I MEAN, THE GIRL IS...

28:40.250 --> 28:41.792
HEAD-OVER-HEELS
SMITTEN WITH YOU.

28:41.792 --> 28:43.959
SHE REALLY CARES ABOUT
YOU AND YOUR FUTURE.

28:48.542 --> 28:49.959
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I WOULD HAVE

28:49.959 --> 28:50.875
GOTTEN THROUGH
ALL THIS WITHOUT HER.

28:54.959 --> 28:56.250
LILLY AND I...

28:56.250 --> 28:57.625
WE'LL BE OK.

28:57.625 --> 28:59.500
I PROMISE.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.500
I'LL HIRE SOME HELP

29:01.500 --> 29:04.667
AROUND HERE
IF I NEED TO.

29:04.667 --> 29:07.750
SO, DAWSON...
