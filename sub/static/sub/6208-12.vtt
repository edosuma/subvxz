WEBVTT

00:07.163 --> 00:08.591
Yep, this is were I live.

00:10.879 --> 00:11.750
Hey.

00:11.751 --> 00:13.022
Sabrina, you're home.

00:13.023 --> 00:15.425
Just in time for our
Cinco de Mayo celebration.

00:15.426 --> 00:18.030
Cinco de Mayo?
It was just El new years.

00:18.191 --> 00:21.877
know but while the rest of New England
is complaining about the weather,

00:21.878 --> 00:25.321
we are turning up the heat
with a little south of the boarder fiesta.

00:26.343 --> 00:28.581
- Crispy flouchets?
- No gracias.

00:29.138 --> 00:30.419
You guys are weird.

00:30.420 --> 00:32.290
Well excuse us for having fun.

00:32.292 --> 00:35.297
- We were going to ask you to join us.
- But if you're too up:tight?

00:35.298 --> 00:36.698
Don't say that.

00:36.699 --> 00:38.759
There's nothing worse than when
your parents call you up:tight.

00:38.925 --> 00:41.199
Come on, loosen up.

00:41.573 --> 00:44.180
You know you want to wear a sombrero.

00:45.376 --> 00:47.604
Now try an Ole!

00:48.747 --> 00:49.783
Ole!

00:50.458 --> 00:53.134
Hey that was sorta fun.
Alright, I'm in.

00:53.661 --> 00:56.917
- Where's the salsa?
- Over here but it's kinda spicy.

00:56.918 --> 00:58.318
I think I can handle it cat.

01:01.489 --> 01:02.902
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

01:03.951 --> 01:05.413
Hm, it feels warmer in here already.

01:09.687 --> 01:12.696

01:29.432 --> 01:34.741
So, 'R' equals seven plus
eleven over two, or nine..

01:36.459 --> 01:40.484
And 'r' equals seven minus eleven
over two, or minus two.

01:42.533 --> 01:45.008
That's it, I've reached my
chalk limit for the day.

01:47.405 --> 01:49.637
- What is it Sabrina?
- I have a question?

01:49.638 --> 01:51.896
I know that. That's why I said
'What is it Sabrina?'

01:52.236 --> 01:55.291
Well in that problem the roots turn
out to be round numbers

01:55.292 --> 01:57.316
but what if the roots turn
out to be irrational?

01:57.317 --> 01:59.653
Irrational?
You mean like teenage girls?

02:00.365 --> 02:03.190
Just express those roots
in radical form.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.462
You mean as fraction?

02:04.915 --> 02:06.410
Didn't you read the text book?

02:06.411 --> 02:07.811
Yeah but it's kinda confusing.

02:07.862 --> 02:12.135
Well let's find out who's confused
and who isn't by having a little test tomorrow.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.732
And you can all thank Sabrina for it.

02:17.486 --> 02:19.490
I was just trying to learn!

02:22.248 --> 02:23.713
- Ye:ello?
- Salem?

02:23.714 --> 02:25.342
- Speaking.
- This is Shelly.

02:25.343 --> 02:26.456
Shelly?!

02:26.691 --> 02:30.127
Zelda, you'll never guess who called.
I'll give you a hint. Shelly.

02:30.128 --> 02:33.203
Shelly? Your ex:girlfriend?
The one who left you?

02:33.204 --> 02:36.445
She didn't leave me!
She just needed some time by herself.

02:36.446 --> 02:37.720
Two decades?

02:37.721 --> 02:41.332
but and I repeat but
by the sound of her voice,

02:41.333 --> 02:43.334
I'd say she has crawling
back on her mind.

02:43.335 --> 02:47.342
I see. Did you happen to mention
that you're a cat now?

02:47.343 --> 02:48.821
Is it that noticeable?

02:50.270 --> 02:53.088
Oh not again.
Hilda, stop that!

02:54.093 --> 02:55.695
It wasn't me.

02:58.354 --> 03:00.424
- Sabrina?
- What's wrong?

03:00.425 --> 03:02.648
Mr. Rothwell's giving us
a huge math test tomorrow.

03:02.649 --> 03:06.079
So now I have to go and memorise
formulas like 'X' equals why me?!

03:07.133 --> 03:09.138
You watch that finger young lady!

03:10.668 --> 03:13.292
Negative 'B' plus or minus the
square:root of 'B' squared

03:13.293 --> 03:15.855
minus four 'A' 'C' over two 'A'

03:15.856 --> 03:19.730
Shake your whammy fanny.
Funky song. Funky song.

03:19.731 --> 03:21.810
- Shake your whammy fanny..
- Harvey!

03:22.198 --> 03:23.211
What?

03:23.312 --> 03:24.766
You're singing the funky song.

03:24.767 --> 03:26.968
Now it's going to be stuck in
my head during the whole test.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.078
Sorry. I didn't even know I was doing it.

03:29.079 --> 03:31.109
Well I'm really nervous so
please don't sing.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.110
Okay.

03:32.777 --> 03:36.688
Negative 'B' plus or minus
the square:root of 'B'..

03:36.689 --> 03:38.194
I hear you thinking it.

03:38.225 --> 03:40.490
- I can't think it?
- Not while I'm studying.

03:40.958 --> 03:43.648
- Can I at least finish this verse?
- Yeah, but hurry up.

03:48.221 --> 03:50.026
- Okay. Done.
- Good.

03:50.863 --> 03:55.032
Negative 'B' plus or minus the
square:root of... I hate Rothwell!

03:55.426 --> 03:57.516
Look Sabrina, you know this stuff.

03:57.517 --> 03:59.966
You know you know it, you just have to relax.

03:59.967 --> 04:01.499
I can't. Do you see this?

04:01.500 --> 04:03.158
This is me freaking out.

04:03.776 --> 04:05.386
Okay now please can I just study?

04:05.887 --> 04:07.937
I promise, I wont make a noise.

04:14.786 --> 04:16.237
You can turn the page.

04:18.882 --> 04:20.154
Gordie, hurry!

04:20.432 --> 04:22.955
Wait! How do I find the slope of a line?

04:22.956 --> 04:27.231
Oh that's easy, you just..
I lost it! The slope slipped.

04:27.232 --> 04:28.710
If only we had more time.

04:33.252 --> 04:34.323
Much better.

04:38.292 --> 04:42.652
'M' equals dah:de:dah,
d:dah da. I knew that!

04:47.109 --> 04:49.185
Shake your whammy fanny.

04:51.452 --> 04:54.063
Okay, it's 'M' equals 'Y' sub two minus

04:54.098 --> 04:56.679
'Y' sub one over 'X' sub two minus 'X' sub one.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.912
You saved my life.

04:57.913 --> 05:00.178
Thank me later.
Right now move! Move! Move! Move!

05:00.179 --> 05:04.200
Five.
Four. Three. Two.

05:05.062 --> 05:06.140
'F'

05:06.420 --> 05:07.503
Poor Emma.

05:07.504 --> 05:09.983
I think she stopped to help
that girl in the wheel:chair.

05:10.084 --> 05:11.852
Too late. Bye:bye.

05:13.666 --> 05:15.164
All right let's get started.

05:15.625 --> 05:19.469
The test consists of fifteen questions
for a possible one hundred points.

05:20.324 --> 05:22.997
The first five are worth nine points;
the next five eight points;

05:23.198 --> 05:25.800
the last five are little three pointers.
You may begin.

05:32.225 --> 05:33.437
What was that?

05:33.438 --> 05:34.672
I dropped my pencil.

05:34.906 --> 05:36.478
Oh please, I know what's going on here,

05:36.479 --> 05:38.361
you were leaning over to look at your neighbours test.

05:38.362 --> 05:39.388
No! I:I..

05:39.389 --> 05:42.204
That's it! Come sit at my desk,
you'll take the test there.

05:42.932 --> 05:45.175
Then I wont have to worry about you cheating.

05:45.663 --> 05:47.723
But I've never cheated on a test in my life.

05:47.724 --> 05:49.229
Then this should be no problem.

05:52.277 --> 05:53.496
Okay, get to work.

05:54.713 --> 05:58.640
- Negative 'B' plus or minus..
- Funky song. Funky song.

05:58.641 --> 06:01.172
Harvey! Why do I study with Harvey?

06:01.845 --> 06:05.118
Because he's cute.
I wonder if we'll get married?

06:05.428 --> 06:07.080
No:no:no! Pay attention.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.682
Negative 'B' plus or minus..

06:10.099 --> 06:12.172
I hate Rothwell! I hate Rothwell!

06:13.933 --> 06:15.949
Oh no! Can he hear me think?

06:16.603 --> 06:19.083
can't tense up.

06:24.089 --> 06:25.988
Why is everyone writing so loud?

06:26.560 --> 06:28.644
Why did Napoleon want to rule by himself?

06:28.645 --> 06:30.712
No! Math, stick to math.

06:34.716 --> 06:37.115
You know this stuff. You can do this.

06:37.981 --> 06:38.990
Negative 'B'..

06:40.580 --> 06:43.078
- What!
- Pencils down, times up.

06:45.354 --> 06:49.360
..Then add one macadamia nut
and he will have an expanding butt.

06:51.332 --> 06:53.603
What's going on? I heard an explosion!

06:54.135 --> 06:55.959
Oh, you're just making soup.

06:56.312 --> 06:58.942
No, I'm stirring up a little revenge
for Mr. Rothwell.

06:58.943 --> 07:00.021
What happened?

07:00.022 --> 07:01.492
It was so humiliating.

07:01.493 --> 07:03.525
He made me take the test
in front of the whole class.

07:03.726 --> 07:05.220
Like some sort of zoo monkey?

07:05.221 --> 07:06.231
Yeah.

07:06.232 --> 07:07.562
Co:Co hate teacher man.

07:07.563 --> 07:10.748
Anyway I know I flunked.
So I'm giving him an expanding butt

07:10.749 --> 07:12.757
until I can find the perfect revenge spell.

07:12.758 --> 07:17.778
Well you know nothing says 'Pay:back' like
'Just desserts'

07:17.779 --> 07:20.580
'The spell that guarantees
he'll get what's coming to him'

07:20.581 --> 07:22.671
But it's only to be used
as a last resort.

07:22.672 --> 07:25.116
You might want to try
and deal with him the mortal way first.

07:25.117 --> 07:26.479
You mean tepee his house?

07:26.480 --> 07:27.953
No. Talk to him.

07:28.718 --> 07:30.919
I don't want to. You talk to him.

07:31.771 --> 07:33.641
- Mr. Rothwell?
- Yeah.

07:33.742 --> 07:36.968
Hi, I'm Hilda Spellman, Sabrina's aunt.

07:37.169 --> 07:39.431
I wanted to talk to you about
the test she took today.

07:39.762 --> 07:42.749
Excellent timing, I've just
finished correcting them. I'll find hers.

07:42.750 --> 07:45.355
Oh thanks. See she's upset because
Oh thanks. See she's upset because

07:45.356 --> 07:48.264
but I know she didn't because she's
very bright and she studied so hard..

07:48.265 --> 07:49.343
She got an 'F'

07:49.344 --> 07:50.833
That's impossible.

07:51.561 --> 07:53.049
Are you sure you added it up right?

07:53.050 --> 07:56.109
Miss Spellman, I'm a math teacher
but feel free to double check.

07:57.424 --> 07:58.983
There were fifteen questions.

07:58.984 --> 08:02.297
The first five were worth forty points,
the next five worth forty:five

08:02.398 --> 08:04.085
and the last five were worth fifteen.

08:04.086 --> 08:07.666
abrina got two of the biggies, three of the middies
and one of the babies..

08:07.667 --> 08:10.128
for a grand total of forty:five points.
What percent of a hundred?

08:10.129 --> 08:12.081
Oh! I:er... Fifteen questions.

08:12.082 --> 08:14.911
One hundred points. Thirty:two. I have no idea!

08:14.912 --> 08:17.315
Forty:five percent! Jeez, no wonder she failed.

08:17.316 --> 08:19.581
Oh! But I didn't have a chance
to study for this meeting.

08:21.251 --> 08:24.056
More lizards leg and don't skimp on the owlet's wing.

08:24.459 --> 08:27.491
Let's put in this jar of cocktail onions
that have been in the fridge forever.

08:27.492 --> 08:28.492
Yeah!

08:28.493 --> 08:29.902
What smells so sweet?

08:29.903 --> 08:31.003
Revenge.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.332
It's time to teach Mr. Rothwell a lesson.

08:33.485 --> 08:36.503
With a number two cauldron?
It can't be that serious.

08:36.504 --> 08:37.909
- It is.
- Keep stirring!

08:37.909 --> 08:40.346
there's been a breakdown in communication.

08:40.347 --> 08:44.198
I will go talk to him
as physicist to algebra teacher

08:44.198 --> 08:46.491
and we will work this out logically,

08:46.811 --> 08:49.679
and no:one seeks vengeance until I get back.

08:52.091 --> 08:53.825
Can I at least make his butt a little bigger?

08:53.826 --> 08:55.722
As big as you want it to be.

08:57.143 --> 09:00.590
I wanted to discuss this rationally
but you're making it hard.

09:00.591 --> 09:04.026
Hey! She failed the test,
what do you want me to do about it?

09:04.027 --> 09:06.185
But the circumstances were unfair!

09:06.186 --> 09:08.605
Look, if it makes you feel better,
you can blame this on me

09:08.606 --> 09:10.979
but I think we both know these
problems start at home.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.425
What problems?

09:12.683 --> 09:15.774
Hey, if the kid can't master the
quadratic equation that says to me,

09:15.975 --> 09:17.375
dysfunctional family.

09:18.020 --> 09:20.592
We function just fine!

09:20.593 --> 09:22.077
Tell it to her social worker.

09:22.457 --> 09:25.923
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get to the gym.

09:31.201 --> 09:33.889
This is so great. Thank you so much
for backing me up.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.657
Well you were one hundred percent right
about this guy.

09:36.658 --> 09:38.290
Please, no percentages.

09:38.291 --> 09:39.500
Is it revenge yet?

09:39.946 --> 09:41.631
Mmm! It's really spiteful.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.868
Let's finish the spell.
Hilda, you do the honours.

09:45.325 --> 09:48.405
Adder's fork and blind worms sting..

09:48.406 --> 09:51.008
Lizards leg and owlets wing.

09:51.682 --> 09:56.295
For a charm of powerful trouble,
fire burn and cauldron bubble.

09:56.462 --> 09:57.928
Take it away Sabrina!

09:57.929 --> 10:02.854
Fair is foul and foul is fair,
hover through fog and filthy air.

10:05.361 --> 10:06.391
Now what?

10:06.392 --> 10:07.592
Wait and see.

10:11.843 --> 10:14.864
You cackled! This is gonna be so cool.

10:18.263 --> 10:20.811
Wierd, Rothwell is never late.

10:21.741 --> 10:24.980
Maybe he called in sick
or maybe he had car trouble.

10:24.981 --> 10:27.222
Or maybe the earth yawned and swallowed him up.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.286
It could happen.

10:30.867 --> 10:32.132
Oh tooth:picks!

10:33.571 --> 10:36.179
I am late! For the first time in my life!

10:36.376 --> 10:38.987
Because I've been the victim of a great injustice.

10:38.988 --> 10:39.988
Yes!

10:39.989 --> 10:42.640
- I got a speeding ticket.
- A speeding ticket?

10:43.735 --> 10:45.596
Three witches and a number ten cauldron..

10:45.597 --> 10:47.630
and the best we could do was
a stupid speeding ticket?

10:47.731 --> 10:50.657
Maybe the lizards leg wasn't fresh.
I thought it smelled funny.

10:50.946 --> 10:53.821
Great! Rothwell'll probably just go to court
and weasel out of it.

10:53.822 --> 10:57.349
Court! The spell is working.
He'll find his just desserts there.

10:57.350 --> 10:58.941
Let's go early and get good seats.

10:58.942 --> 11:01.370
And don't worry, justice will be served.

11:01.371 --> 11:03.850
Oh yeah? Then how come his butt deflated?

11:04.207 --> 11:06.042
What do ya think? A red Lamborgini.

11:06.043 --> 11:08.245
This has to impress my ex:girlfriend Shelly.

11:08.375 --> 11:11.596
Sure! Now all you have to do is
lose the paws, the whiskers and the fur.

11:11.597 --> 11:15.416
Hey, so what if I'm a cat?
This car says I've got it going on!

11:18.058 --> 11:19.707
It's a travesty of justice sir!

11:19.708 --> 11:22.910
I mean I know red,
red is the colour of rage!

11:23.246 --> 11:25.884
And that light was not red,
it was yellow.

11:26.259 --> 11:27.505
Yellow as the sunshine.

11:28.186 --> 11:32.268
Well in light of your flowery prose
and the fact that the arresting officer didn't show

11:32.469 --> 11:34.515
I'll cut your fine in half.

11:34.516 --> 11:38.581
Half?! Sir, half an injustice
is still an injustice!

11:38.582 --> 11:41.358
Case closed. This court is in recess.

11:43.190 --> 11:46.050
Wait, come back here!
I want that judge, he was easy.

11:46.322 --> 11:47.589
Mr. Rothwell?

11:47.590 --> 11:48.590
Do I know you?

11:48.591 --> 11:50.458
Well of course you wouldn't recognise me.

11:50.459 --> 11:54.779
I mean not without tears streaming
down my face like a harsh, unforgiving rain.

11:55.137 --> 11:57.178
I'm Clifford Weaver,
your former algebra student.

11:57.179 --> 11:58.579
Wait! You're a novelist now.

11:58.580 --> 12:00.827
You wrote 'Rage against the system'
I loved that book.

12:00.828 --> 12:02.311
It was full of hate.

12:04.730 --> 12:05.985
There's Mr. Rothwell.

12:07.837 --> 12:09.264
Oh! I think that's for us.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.094
Either that's part of the spell
or the bailiff keeps steaks.

12:14.095 --> 12:15.908
I bet that's our judge.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.700
- In the refrigerator?
- Yes.

12:17.701 --> 12:20.915
Witch judges take turns in the deep
freeze to prevent media bias.

12:20.916 --> 12:24.899
For example, Judge Samuels has been
in here since nineteen fifty:six.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.289
Wow! A man untouched by CNN.

12:29.638 --> 12:32.170
Now that's a good nights sleep.

12:32.171 --> 12:34.788
Hi Judge Samuels.
Here's the deal.

12:35.167 --> 12:37.702
- We Are...
- Shh! Not a word.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.332
I must stay pure for the law.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.992
Just a cup of cocoa
and I'm in business.

12:51.055 --> 12:52.954
Guilty! Order!

12:52.955 --> 12:55.005
One more outburst like that and I'll...

12:55.379 --> 12:57.633
All right, I'm ready.

12:58.827 --> 13:00.087
The court is in session.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.089
Jeremy Rothwell?

13:03.558 --> 13:05.972
You are charged with
violating vehicular code.

13:05.973 --> 13:08.823
Section sixteen dash four,
driving at an unsafe speed.

13:08.824 --> 13:10.436
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

13:10.621 --> 13:14.066
You are also charged with
violation of the existential code.

13:14.067 --> 13:17.893
Section sixty:three dash 'B' Multiple
counts of being mean and unfair.

13:17.894 --> 13:19.094
How do you plead?

13:19.095 --> 13:21.720
What is this? I never heard of
an existential code.

13:21.721 --> 13:25.631
You have to read the fine print.
How do you plead?

13:26.237 --> 13:27.262
Not guilty.

13:27.990 --> 13:29.838
Plea entered. Strike the 'Ha!'

13:30.258 --> 13:33.594
The prosecution may present it's case.
Are the people present?

13:33.595 --> 13:35.562
- We're the people.
- We are? Cool!

13:35.898 --> 13:37.189
Sabrina! What are you doing here?

13:37.190 --> 13:39.205
Didn't you hear? We're the people.

13:39.954 --> 13:41.912
- Proceed.
- Thank you your honour.

13:42.623 --> 13:45.497
The people would like to call
as their first witness...

13:48.799 --> 13:50.421
Clifford Weaver.

13:57.630 --> 13:59.645
Mmm, minty fresh for m'lady.

14:00.328 --> 14:03.425
I'd be more nervous if
I weren't so good lookin'

14:05.075 --> 14:07.128
..And yes, he failed me.

14:07.369 --> 14:10.980
But I mean listen to those words.
He:failed:me.

14:11.704 --> 14:13.377
Throw the book at him judge.

14:14.516 --> 14:15.762
Thank you Clifford.

14:16.315 --> 14:18.986
Your honour, I'd like to
cross:examine this witness.

14:18.987 --> 14:20.187
Well then proceed.

14:21.159 --> 14:25.029
Clifford, you wrote the book
'Rage against the system' Correct?

14:25.030 --> 14:26.030
Correct.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.774
And isn't it true that
the 'New York Times'

14:27.775 --> 14:30.809
picked you as the best of
a new bread of angry young writers?

14:30.810 --> 14:32.553
I resent that moniker but yes.

14:32.554 --> 14:34.584
But what made you angry, Clifford?

14:34.824 --> 14:36.486
Was it your mother holding your hand?

14:36.587 --> 14:38.470
Was it the librarian patting your head?

14:38.657 --> 14:39.895
Or was it me?

14:39.896 --> 14:42.674
I gave you that anger,
I spoon fed you that rage,

14:42.675 --> 14:45.031
I made you what you are today.
You should thank me!

14:45.613 --> 14:48.489
You never helped me!
That's a lie!

14:48.490 --> 14:49.890
No further questions.

14:50.051 --> 14:52.476
I:I've never been so angry in my life..

14:53.362 --> 14:54.783
That's my second novel!

14:57.071 --> 14:58.538
Quick, call another witness.

14:59.716 --> 15:00.981
The people call..

15:03.138 --> 15:04.936
The arresting officer.

15:08.155 --> 15:09.628
So he was speeding?

15:09.629 --> 15:10.629
Definitely.

15:10.630 --> 15:12.202
- And was he mean?
- Mean?

15:12.203 --> 15:15.056
Mean! Disagreeable?
Unkind? Naveish? Mean?

15:15.057 --> 15:17.035
Well he threw his registration at me.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.965
Then he muttered under his breath
'What a jerk!'

15:19.966 --> 15:22.041
But I heard him,
I have really good ears.

15:23.374 --> 15:24.647
And lovely eyes.

15:25.469 --> 15:26.474
Thank you!

15:27.270 --> 15:28.959
No further questions.

15:30.769 --> 15:32.998
The people call our next witness.

15:35.464 --> 15:36.943
Sabrina Spellman.

15:39.328 --> 15:41.874
Well normally I don't like to say bad
things about people but..

15:42.291 --> 15:43.546
as I am under oath.

15:44.142 --> 15:45.884
Mr. Rothwell's completely unfair.

15:45.885 --> 15:47.694
He doesn't like kids,
he doesn't like math,

15:47.695 --> 15:49.615
he doesn't like teaching
and he doesn't like chalk.

15:50.094 --> 15:54.156
These are very serious charges.
Have you any proof?

15:54.401 --> 15:55.694
I could call my friend Gordie.

15:56.201 --> 15:57.683
Proof! Proof! Any proof?

15:57.684 --> 15:58.909
It doesn't exist.

15:58.910 --> 16:00.893
Mr. Rothwell's unfairness lies
only in the hearts and minds

16:00.894 --> 16:03.475
of those students whose love
of math he has destroyed.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.909
Including yours Sabrina?

16:05.910 --> 16:07.733
It's too early to tell but..

16:07.973 --> 16:11.531
there is a chance that for
the rest of my life I will fear math.

16:11.532 --> 16:13.621
I will sweat every time
I have to calculate a tip.

16:13.622 --> 16:15.450
I will put off balancing my cheque:book.

16:15.451 --> 16:17.746
I will play blackjack but I will not understand it.

16:18.355 --> 16:21.344
If you understood it,
you wouldn't play it.

16:21.999 --> 16:23.990
Thank you, you may step down.

16:24.863 --> 16:27.507
Counsellor, are there any other witnesses?

16:27.508 --> 16:28.780
The people rest.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.377
Would the defendant like
to make a closing statement?

16:32.937 --> 16:34.027
Yes I would.

16:35.355 --> 16:37.838
Your honour, I'm not a baby:sitter.

16:37.847 --> 16:39.888
I'm paid to teach math and that is what I do.

16:40.197 --> 16:43.259
Yes I could be more sensitive but let's face it.

16:43.565 --> 16:45.093
The world is full of people like me.

16:45.141 --> 16:48.141
People who chose favourites.
People who don't accept excuses.

16:48.242 --> 16:50.424
eople who are 'Unfair'

16:51.196 --> 16:52.500
Well life is unfair..

16:52.542 --> 16:55.253
and I'm just helping my students
to get used to that.

16:55.728 --> 16:58.386
Mr. Rothwell, just one last question.

16:58.799 --> 17:01.686
Do you intend to teach high school
for the rest of your life?

17:01.687 --> 17:02.740
Are you kidding?

17:02.741 --> 17:05.436
I'm just doing this
until I can start up my own software company.

17:05.932 --> 17:06.989
Thank you.

17:07.932 --> 17:12.211
Well I will return with my decision
and a fresh cup of cocoa.

17:13.779 --> 17:16.419
Flowers. Soft lights. What's missing?

17:17.733 --> 17:19.170
Oops! Almost forgot.

17:23.151 --> 17:24.356
Oh yeah.

17:25.729 --> 17:27.192
I've reached my decision.

17:28.686 --> 17:31.448
With respect to existential code violation

17:31.683 --> 17:35.377
this court finds you not guilty
due to insufficient evidence.

17:35.883 --> 17:38.903
With respect to the vehicular code violation

17:39.288 --> 17:41.526
the court finds you guilty as charged.

17:41.527 --> 17:42.677
Oh nuts!

17:42.849 --> 17:46.344
But we'll wave the usual forty dollars fine

17:46.345 --> 17:52.379
and instead sentence you to a lifetime
of teaching high school algebra.

17:52.380 --> 17:54.229
What! That's not fair!

17:54.743 --> 17:55.761
Case closed.

17:56.185 --> 18:01.250
No! Noooo! Oh noo!

18:01.658 --> 18:02.750
N:N:Noooo!

18:04.839 --> 18:08.322
This trial shall be stricken
from all mortal memory.

18:09.548 --> 18:10.911
Court is adjourned.

18:12.035 --> 18:13.144
Wait a second,

18:13.145 --> 18:17.002
How can being sentenced to teaching
high school be sufficient punishment?

18:17.103 --> 18:20.170
Because it's the worst thing
Mr. Rothwell can imagine.

18:20.171 --> 18:22.979
ut now kids are going to be stuck
with him year after year.

18:22.980 --> 18:26.123
Well whether he means to or not,
he teaches a valuable lesson.

18:26.124 --> 18:27.652
Some people are just jerks?

18:28.045 --> 18:29.060
Yes,

18:29.350 --> 18:31.573
but if you study hard and
you don't let him get to you,

18:31.574 --> 18:34.703
you will pass algebra
and then you can forget it.

18:35.009 --> 18:36.532
But he's trapped in math forever.

18:37.058 --> 18:38.889
So he did get his just desserts.

18:39.231 --> 18:41.147
M:hm! And now I think we should
get frozen desserts.

18:48.143 --> 18:49.351
The doors open.

18:52.592 --> 18:53.664
Salem?

18:53.665 --> 18:54.920
I don't believe it.

18:54.921 --> 18:57.590
You look even more stunning
than the last time I saw you.

18:57.591 --> 19:00.376
It's so good to see you too.

19:00.377 --> 19:02.651
- Don't! Stay back.
- Why?

19:02.678 --> 19:05.205
You said you wanted to talk,
so let's talk.

19:05.599 --> 19:09.788
You wanna talk?
You have changed.

19:09.789 --> 19:10.989
You could say that.

19:11.492 --> 19:12.735
Is that your cat?

19:12.736 --> 19:14.220
Huh! Er:er yes.

19:15.189 --> 19:17.823
They make incredible companions
you know.

19:18.106 --> 19:20.402
So, what's on your mind?

19:20.777 --> 19:25.763
Us and how we broke up.
See at the time I felt shut out.

19:25.764 --> 19:28.361
You were so consumed with global conquest

19:28.362 --> 19:31.381
and I resented taking a back
seat to world domination.

19:31.867 --> 19:34.294
But here it is, thirty years later

19:34.295 --> 19:38.913
and now I realise that you were
the best thing that ever happened to me.

19:39.651 --> 19:40.708
Go on!

19:40.709 --> 19:45.003
I know it's kinda sudden but
I think we should give it another try.

19:45.004 --> 19:48.051
I don't see why not.
I care about you, you care about me..

19:48.052 --> 19:51.094
Enough words! Salem, hold me!

19:51.427 --> 19:52.723
Oh Shelly!

19:52.724 --> 19:54.971
Oh! Oh! Cat! Get off me!

19:56.265 --> 19:58.313
- Salem!
- I can explain.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.270
Salem? Is that you?

20:03.271 --> 20:05.132
- Yes.
- You're a cat?

20:05.582 --> 20:06.841
Technically.

20:06.842 --> 20:08.209
Who's your friend?

20:09.199 --> 20:10.743
A mannequin!

20:11.737 --> 20:13.990
How long were you expecting this to fool me?

20:13.991 --> 20:15.755
Another thirty seconds.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.240
Oh all right, look.

20:17.241 --> 20:21.205
I got caught and they sentenced me
to a hundred years as this.

20:21.206 --> 20:23.234
This is not what I had in mind.

20:23.235 --> 20:24.736
We can work it out!

20:24.737 --> 20:27.215
Sorry cat, this is good:bye!

20:28.288 --> 20:29.884
I loved you!

20:30.119 --> 20:32.567
But I'm better now! I like to snuggle!

20:32.568 --> 20:35.577
I have great night vision and I'm super,
super clean!

20:36.780 --> 20:39.631
It's so unfair.

20:42.830 --> 20:47.835
Which equals the square root of negative
four or two 'I' Got it! Perfect.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.100
You seem a lot more relaxed today.

20:50.255 --> 20:52.680
Yeah well I decided I'm not going
to let Rothwell get to me.

20:53.198 --> 20:55.194
And you know I'm even feeling a little sorry for him.

20:55.195 --> 20:57.873
Did you hear the financing
fell through on his software company?

20:58.042 --> 21:00.096
Have you noticed how big his butts got?

21:01.013 --> 21:02.744
No. Okay, last problem.

21:05.169 --> 21:09.004
Shake your whammy fanny.
Funky song. Funky song.

21:09.105 --> 21:12.939
Shake your whammy fanny.
Fu:u:u:nky song.

21:12.940 --> 21:13.940
Shhh!

21:13.941 --> 21:14.941
Sorry.

21:25.502 --> 21:26.546
Poor Salem.

21:27.267 --> 21:28.562
Are you going to be okay?

21:28.563 --> 21:30.904
I guess, with time...

21:31.847 --> 21:32.890
No.

21:32.891 --> 21:34.694
Don't worry, you'll be happy again soon.

21:34.695 --> 21:37.004
Please! Shelly was the love of my life.

21:37.334 --> 21:39.600
What would ever replace her in my heart?

21:39.874 --> 21:41.121
Maybe this'll help.

21:41.954 --> 21:43.827
A giant ball of yarn!

21:43.928 --> 21:45.989
Oh this is the best ever!

21:45.990 --> 21:47.597
- I thought you'd like it.
- Like it?

21:47.598 --> 21:49.815
I don't even remember her name!
