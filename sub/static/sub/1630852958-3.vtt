WEBVTT

00:01.936 --> 00:03.619
Hey, look at you go.

00:03.671 --> 00:04.620
[bleep] yeah.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.789
Amazing!
Yes.

00:06.841 --> 00:08.540
If the food is right,
everything is right.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.930
I feel like I'm finally working
in a team environment.

00:14.965 --> 00:17.933
♪ gary does some dishes ♪

00:17.968 --> 00:19.618
yeah, great.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.770
I want daisy to feel like she
can depend on me as her second.

00:21.806 --> 00:23.255
This is no big deal, I got this.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.941
Do it where the flap covers,
so it goes this way.

00:25.976 --> 00:27.276
-Okay.
-[sighs]

00:27.311 --> 00:29.628
if a guy is, like, super,
super hot,

00:29.663 --> 00:32.597
you won't date him if he's not
the age group that you like?

00:32.616 --> 00:33.932
Oh my god.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.868
Shut the [bleep] up.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.319
Hey, lady in pink.

00:38.739 --> 00:39.738
What problem?

00:42.159 --> 00:43.976
No, no, no, you take it easy.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.045
So, I have no chance.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.618
I don't go out with guys
that are my age.

00:52.653 --> 00:53.969
-Can I just say one thing?
-Oh.

00:54.004 --> 00:55.387
How is that hanging out for you,

00:55.423 --> 00:57.089
because you're
single as [bleep].

01:29.173 --> 01:31.023
Yeah, I threw... Exactly.
So, that...

01:31.058 --> 01:32.424
So, you just base your
opinions around that.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.344
I'm just not into guys
that are my age.

01:35.379 --> 01:37.496
I made a mistake. There'll
be plenty of mistakes

01:37.531 --> 01:39.231
that you've made that
we don't know about.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.232
Sounds good!

01:40.267 --> 01:41.683
Just get over it.

01:41.719 --> 01:43.218
You don't need to cry
and whine about it.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.554
If my mind changes,
I'll let you know.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.307
No, yeah, fair enough.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.228
This is...
Oh, my god.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.813
What happened?

01:58.685 --> 02:00.685
You're out of diapers,
like, same as me.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.988
You don't ----ing...
You've got less experience

02:03.023 --> 02:04.690
in this business than I do.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.793
I don't need someone telling me
you're so immature.

02:08.862 --> 02:09.795
No, I don't.

02:11.866 --> 02:14.133
Shut the [bleep] up, mate,
you're not ----ing mature.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.535
Good night, youngster.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.253
-Junior deckie.
-Bye, junior.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.671
Junior deckie!

02:29.517 --> 02:30.682
Gabby?

02:30.717 --> 02:31.650
What?

02:42.830 --> 02:45.264
I feel like I was organized
until getting drunk...

02:45.299 --> 02:46.582
Yeah, it's so...

02:46.617 --> 02:48.400
...And then I just throw
everything around.

02:48.435 --> 02:51.787
Ashley, you need to vacuum
the starboard cabin,

02:51.839 --> 02:53.922
the starboard twin
and the hallway.

02:53.958 --> 02:54.923
Okay.

02:54.959 --> 02:56.341
All right, cool.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.509
You... You'll, you can
tell which ones...

02:57.545 --> 02:59.428
-Yeah.
-Haven't been vacuumed.

02:59.463 --> 03:01.046
It's like, ugh.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.098
I'm not gonna make
a big stink about it.

03:03.133 --> 03:07.219
Okay, let's go clean, yay!

03:15.779 --> 03:18.063
Junior!
Junes!

03:18.098 --> 03:19.565
Yes, sir.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.650
You weren't having any of
it last night.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.635
No, [bleep] no and
I'm still not having it now.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.320
I think you both have got
a crush on each other.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.672
No, absolutely not.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.140
Today's the day.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.142
Just gonna try to organize
the most I can.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.244
-I'm gonna go crack on.
-Thank you.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.913
You're welcome.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.816
Yeah, I thought we had a
good night last night.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.017
I also thought we had a
good night last night,

03:39.053 --> 03:40.552
until the end of the night.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.921
Look, people get drunk
and people have an argument.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.590
Maybe I just heard
the whole thing wrong.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.624
Yeah?

03:45.643 --> 03:47.926
Or maybe I just didn't
like what she said.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.144
Yeah, exactly.

03:49.179 --> 03:50.479
I think speak
to her this morning.

03:50.514 --> 03:52.164
-I'm going to.
-Just clear the air.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.933
2023.

03:54.969 --> 03:56.568
You wanna get everything for
a wash-down ready.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.020
Make sure you get
everything with soap.

03:58.072 --> 04:00.239
-Okay.
-Sweet.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.382
Yeah.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.366
Did he say anything about
last night?

04:11.418 --> 04:12.985
No, it's all good.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.620
I hope we didn't wake him up
with the little tiff.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.004
What happened last night,
why you fight with tom?

04:16.040 --> 04:17.756
No, tom was just, like...
He's, like...

04:17.791 --> 04:18.990
Can't wrap his head around why
I won't go out

04:19.009 --> 04:20.492
with somebody my age.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.628
I think y'all just need
to bang it out, honestly.

04:22.663 --> 04:23.862
No!

04:23.897 --> 04:25.830
I was just like, I'm entitled
to my own ----ing opinion.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.966
Like, if you can't
understand that, then just,

04:28.001 --> 04:28.934
like [bleep] off.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.835
Ah, to be young again.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.170
He likes you.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.389
Well, I don't think he would
have done that if he didn't.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.309
I remember one time
I used to work on a boat.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.810
It was all women.

04:38.845 --> 04:41.113
First mate, second officer,
everything...

04:41.148 --> 04:42.531
Everything was women.

04:42.566 --> 04:44.616
I was young,
so I have sex with everyone.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.451
It's good for you guys
to talk about it.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.203
No, I'm gonna talk to him, but
I was planning on that anyway.

04:48.238 --> 04:50.622
But nobody knew until one day,

04:50.658 --> 04:52.624
they started drinking,
and that's it...

04:52.660 --> 04:55.077
It was ----ing marcos,
they wanna burn me alive.

04:55.129 --> 04:57.212
Like, I'm gonna have a
conversation with him about it.

04:57.247 --> 04:58.797
They're gonna
learn the hard way.

05:00.551 --> 05:01.633
[chuckles]

05:06.256 --> 05:07.222
ugh!

05:07.257 --> 05:08.440
Morning, morning, morning.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.708
Good morning, captain glenn.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.760
This transom's not clean eh?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.779
Yep, that's on
the to-do list today.

05:13.814 --> 05:14.730
Cool.

05:14.765 --> 05:17.482
<i> Gary, marcos, and daisy,</i>

05:17.518 --> 05:19.851
can I get you to meet me
in the crew mess

05:19.886 --> 05:22.220
for a preference sheet
meeting, please?

05:22.239 --> 05:24.823
<i> On my way.</i>

05:24.858 --> 05:27.943
-Okay, here we are.
-Let's go.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.561
One there, one there...

05:29.596 --> 05:31.413
-Surprise!
-One there...

05:31.448 --> 05:33.865
-Ooh!
-Oh, no!

05:33.900 --> 05:35.834
-No!
-What?

05:35.869 --> 05:36.752
Oh sh--.

05:36.787 --> 05:40.005
It's ----ing erica, oh, no.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.876
I don't know why you guys
laughing so much, but...

05:44.911 --> 05:47.012
-We had these guys last year.
-Oh, okay.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.798
And I'll put it this way,
they were very interesting.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.884
Dad always hired people
to unpack for me.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.687
He did, so I want to
do as little as possible,

05:55.723 --> 05:57.289
ta-tas for trump.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.890
Hi, girl, what are you doing?

05:58.925 --> 06:00.809
So, you don't have
to be here right now.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.427
So, you can wait,
because it's not ready yet.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.696
It was a really tiring
energy to be around.

06:07.301 --> 06:09.151
Charter number two, erica rose,

06:09.203 --> 06:10.619
an attorney and mother of two,

06:10.654 --> 06:12.537
is back with her
mom, cindi rose.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.539
The two have gathered a
new group of guests

06:14.575 --> 06:15.941
to experience the luxury

06:15.976 --> 06:17.909
and adventure of sailing
in the mediterranean.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.294
Ooh, they're coming
with their husbands now,

06:19.329 --> 06:20.829
so it could be
a little bit different.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.683
Also coming are erica's
good friends halhe, susan,

06:24.718 --> 06:27.219
and married couple
janelle and rhett.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.554
So, because there are seven
guests coming on this trip,

06:29.590 --> 06:32.457
erica and her mom insist
that the master

06:32.476 --> 06:35.193
be divided into separate spaces

06:35.229 --> 06:37.128
so that erica and her husband

06:37.147 --> 06:38.980
have a private space
separate from sandy.

06:39.016 --> 06:40.182
Are we able to do that?

06:40.234 --> 06:42.100
I don't think it's feasible
to put

06:42.135 --> 06:43.802
the old divider that
we have on the boat.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.970
We haven't used it for,
like, six or seven years.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.739
So, we're gonna have
to improvise.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.075
Maybe we can, I don't know,
hang something.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.326
Yeah, for sure.

06:51.361 --> 06:53.211
On night one, the guests
are requesting

06:53.247 --> 06:54.913
a steak and scotch dinner party.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.449
On day two, the guests would
like a boozy brunch party

06:57.484 --> 06:59.000
on the beach.

06:59.036 --> 07:01.670
On night two, for dinner,
they want a decades party

07:01.705 --> 07:05.340
where they will celebrate
each decade of the last...

07:05.375 --> 07:07.626
Fifty years.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.628
Erica excepts a higher
level of service

07:09.663 --> 07:11.346
than she received
last charter season.

07:11.381 --> 07:12.831
Okay, interesting.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.801
This is the worst news ever.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.220
These people are disrespectful,
they're exhausting,

07:18.272 --> 07:19.888
they're emotionally draining,

07:19.940 --> 07:22.357
and the biggest thing for me
is they're unpredictable.

07:22.392 --> 07:23.608
That's what's scary.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.694
I just don't want it.

07:25.729 --> 07:28.880
You all right, dais?

07:28.916 --> 07:29.748
Coming up...

07:29.783 --> 07:31.900
To me, this whole title
of second stew,

07:31.952 --> 07:34.119
third stew is a
little obsolete right now.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.121
----Ing amen.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.156
You know, until daisy
tells me not to...

07:38.192 --> 07:40.492
You don't think that know
what I'm doing?

07:45.531 --> 07:47.332
We could probably figure
this thing out pretty quickly,

07:47.367 --> 07:49.067
to be honest.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.869
Hose, bucket.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.371
We just suspend it from here,
look, all the way along here.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.973
To me, that's the best.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.976
For the bathroom, they have a
toilet there and a toilet there.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.077
Mm-hmm.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.679
And if they want it divided,

08:00.714 --> 08:02.080
it's just a matter of pulling
that out and closing it.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.682
Yeah.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.552
We'll get some material here
as quickly as possible.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.087
-Looking better.
-Hey.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.522
Hi.

08:10.557 --> 08:12.023
So, just gonna talk about
the charter real quick.

08:12.058 --> 08:16.628
We had the two ladies,
cindi and erica, last year.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.079
First thing when
they came last year,

08:18.115 --> 08:19.865
they wanted their luggage
unpacked.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.368
They had so much luggage,

08:25.873 --> 08:27.639
I don't have all night
to, like, tidy.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.406
No.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.841
So, it's just the best I can do.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.209
And we're not
like their mother.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.095
So, just be prepared.

08:34.131 --> 08:35.797
And you're gonna
be fine, sweetie.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.116
Yeah, we did a really
good job last charter.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.801
Let's try and keep it up.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.687
So, we're actually gonna
do trip on, trip off.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.122
Gabriela will be on mornings...

08:44.157 --> 08:45.440
Okay, so, like, rotate.

08:45.475 --> 08:46.725
So you'll be lates
this trip, yeah.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.259
-So, if you crack on here...
-Okay.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.111
And just go back
through everything,

08:50.147 --> 08:51.479
I'll come down
and check as well.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.831
-Let's keep this up.
-Wonderful.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.734
-Charter two!
-Yes, I'm so excited.

08:55.769 --> 08:56.868
Yeah.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.538
Marquito!

08:59.573 --> 09:01.706
Hi, suzanna, it's gary here
from sailing yacht parsifal.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.942
I'm looking for
a piece of cloth,

09:03.961 --> 09:06.995
ideally black material,
so a long rectangle.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.131
Hi, this is daisy calling from
sailing yacht parsifal iii.

09:10.167 --> 09:14.052
I need scotch bottles,
cigars by tomorrow.

09:14.087 --> 09:17.088
[bleep] I hate putting
cushions on covers.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.890
Somebody shrinking these?

09:18.926 --> 09:20.425
[laughing]

09:23.330 --> 09:24.296
I was hoping to find
love this season.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.630
Oh yeah?

09:25.666 --> 09:27.148
You know the first night
when we were trying

09:27.184 --> 09:28.667
and you were like, "yeah,
you should get with her, bro,"

09:28.702 --> 09:30.302
but you clearly wanted
to go there.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.804
No, I... Whoa, no, no, no, I
want you to hook up with her.

09:32.823 --> 09:34.305
I think you guys would
make a cute couple.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.907
I want you guys to sort
it out, I think...

09:35.943 --> 09:37.776
I saw her this morning,
and she said...

09:37.811 --> 09:39.177
-It was only a little argument.
-It wasn't, like, a big deal.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.612
Yeah, but I mean,
a little argument

09:40.647 --> 09:42.113
can turn into a massive
thing on a boat.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.548
Yeah, I'm gonna call.

09:43.584 --> 09:46.751
<i> Ashley, ashley, tom.</i>

09:46.787 --> 09:48.853
Ooh, she's ignoring you, bro.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.956
Ashley, ashley, tom.

09:52.843 --> 09:55.660
Why don't you go find her
in the guest cabin?

09:55.696 --> 09:58.129
I could use
a good night's sleep.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.182
It's just a little dookie.
No need to fret.

10:01.218 --> 10:02.701
Hmm, hmm, hmm... Ooh!

10:02.736 --> 10:03.902
Are you ignoring my radio call?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.570
Oh, mine's turned down.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.523
Look, yeah, I'm sorry
about last night.

10:08.558 --> 10:10.208
I thought that you were saying,

10:10.243 --> 10:12.644
like, oh, you know,
he's so young when we're,

10:12.679 --> 10:14.779
like, the same age, and that
just rubs me up the wrong way.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.864
No, I get that.

10:15.899 --> 10:19.784
I got angry because, like,
it's, like, my opinion.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.037
I felt patronized that
you were saying that

10:22.072 --> 10:23.204
I'm some, like, little kid.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.956
Oh, I just like guys
older than me.

10:24.992 --> 10:28.326
Like, gary's 32, and he's gary.

10:30.914 --> 10:32.380
I know I can't be everyone's
cup of tea,

10:36.086 --> 10:37.135
I apologize.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.369
We've got a long season.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.938
-All better.
-All better, come on.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.139
I know, no, I was gonna come
talk to you anyway.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.540
Okay, good.

10:42.576 --> 10:44.809
So, this, you need to
do every night, k2r.

10:44.845 --> 10:45.844
Yeah.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.432
Did we sort out the
cabin downstairs?

10:50.484 --> 10:52.651
We're just gonna put a
cloth divider hanging between.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.785
Okay.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.520
So, those two in the master,
she's in the other one,

10:55.555 --> 10:57.589
and that's your other twin.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.223
I think that's us
done for the day.

10:59.242 --> 11:02.911
Ashley, have a think about
particular decorations you want,

11:02.946 --> 11:04.395
and I'll see...
-Oh, okay.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.598
What I can source.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.700
They're doing
a decade party after dinner?

11:08.735 --> 11:10.585
That's as good as
it's gonna get for now.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.040
Ashley.

11:25.302 --> 11:27.602
So, '70s...
Disco balls.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.557
Is there an article of,
like, clothing or something

11:32.592 --> 11:34.859
that they could get
from each decade?

11:41.535 --> 11:43.034
Okay, so they can
eat upstairs, right?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.869
Like, up on
the flybridge, or no?

11:44.905 --> 11:46.121
Yeah, they can.

11:46.156 --> 11:48.106
So, do we wanna reverse and have
them eat on the flybridge,

11:48.125 --> 11:50.542
and then have the
party downstairs?

11:50.577 --> 11:52.544
Hey, ashley,
just out of curiosity,

11:52.579 --> 11:54.045
how far on the list
did you get?

11:54.081 --> 11:56.581
I'm helping her
with the party planning.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.416
So, like, putting things away,
tidying the bar,

11:58.451 --> 12:01.302
that was just, like, totally,
like, not important at all?

12:01.338 --> 12:02.971
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:03.006 --> 12:04.222
I was doing other
stuff downstairs.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.456
Am I being bitchy?

12:05.475 --> 12:06.808
I was doing other
stuff downstairs.

12:06.843 --> 12:08.143
It's fine,
the boat's looking fine.

12:08.178 --> 12:09.310
We'll have plenty
of time tomorrow.

12:09.346 --> 12:10.645
Are you happy with it?

12:10.680 --> 12:12.296
Yeah, we have loads
of time tomorrow.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.765
Okay, I'll just continue to
do the things on the list.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.100
That's all right,
you can finish.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.651
I'm really hoping
that they can tell

12:16.686 --> 12:17.669
I'm ----ing...
I don't wanna hear it.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.154
I have so much to deal with.

12:19.189 --> 12:22.190
Those two ----ing girls having
an ego trip, no, no, no.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.325
They better find a way
to work with each other.

12:24.361 --> 12:27.612
Gary, do you wanna come
smoke with me?

12:27.647 --> 12:29.114
Going outside.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.083
Where do you want this?

12:32.119 --> 12:34.686
Nope, I don't eat meat,
I'm a pescatarian.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.122
Sometimes I eat meat
when I'm drunk, oops.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.090
What's with the attitude
from you today?

12:39.126 --> 12:40.341
What do you do when someone
doesn't do

12:40.377 --> 12:41.793
what you ask them to do?

12:41.828 --> 12:44.679
I was ----ing doing other
things for hours.

12:44.714 --> 12:46.798
She wants to be second stew,

12:46.833 --> 12:49.184
and I think she's trying to make
me look bad at this point.

12:49.219 --> 12:50.885
Even if she's trying
to make you look bad,

12:50.937 --> 12:52.837
if I call out to you in
front of all the crew,

12:52.873 --> 12:54.939
it looks bad on me and
it makes you look bad.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.608
I think that's really
sound advice, thank you.

12:56.643 --> 12:59.778
I reacted,
I didn't respond well.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.580
I'm going to say sorry
to her in private.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.115
If you've got conflict
on a boat,

13:04.151 --> 13:06.618
your problem become everyone
else's problem on board.

13:06.653 --> 13:10.121
So, pull up your socks
and go say sorry.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.890
I will be better.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.358
I appreciate it,
thank you, gary.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.560
Wow.

13:15.595 --> 13:19.080
-I feel like, whew.
-Very impressed.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.399
I think this trip we
should talk to them

13:21.434 --> 13:22.867
about the menu beforehand.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.552
-Definitely, definitely.
-Yeah.

13:25.755 --> 13:28.173
-Can I speak to you?
-Sure.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.946
Talks and talks?

13:34.981 --> 13:36.064
Okay.

13:36.099 --> 13:37.932
The way that I called you out
in front of everybody

13:37.984 --> 13:40.118
was not cool, and
I'm apologizing for that.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.154
I think I was just nervous that
things weren't put together,

13:43.190 --> 13:46.057
and I was afraid of what daisy
would think about me.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.412
It was a little rude,
but not uncalled for.

13:51.448 --> 13:53.114
I won't do that again.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.699
But, like, I think that
should have crossed your mind

13:54.734 --> 13:56.201
-before you said it like that.
-It should have.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.636
I just think we do have
the same amount of experience,

13:58.672 --> 14:01.589
and to me, this whole title
of second stew,

14:01.625 --> 14:04.742
third stew, is
a little obsolete right now.

14:04.778 --> 14:06.961
Look, I'm still
learning how to manage,

14:07.013 --> 14:08.630
and I'm apologizing for that.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.548
We both have
a year of experience,

14:10.583 --> 14:13.685
but when you don't do what I
say, it does make me look bad.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.053
I did what you said, I...

14:15.088 --> 14:16.437
Sometimes I feel like
you jump over me and...

14:16.473 --> 14:18.189
I don't...

14:18.225 --> 14:20.058
It's not jumping over you,
it's talking to daisy.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.393
-I swear to god.
- I don't want problems.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.062
Like, there's...

14:24.097 --> 14:25.446
There's no problems, that's why
I'm apologizing to you.

14:25.482 --> 14:26.898
Listen, but I'm just...
Okay, that's fine.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.099
So much for taking
the high road.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.284
----Ing a, man.

14:29.319 --> 14:31.202
Until daisy tells me not to...

14:31.238 --> 14:33.137
You don't know that
I know what I'm doing?

14:38.344 --> 14:41.012
The mentality I'm going
with right now is

14:41.047 --> 14:43.715
we're on a level playing field.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.917
Going forward, I don't
wanna fight with you.

14:45.952 --> 14:49.120
I think you're great.
I reacted poorly.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.755
Gabriela is not my boss.

14:50.774 --> 14:52.056
Last time I checked,

14:52.091 --> 14:54.592
she's not chief stew,
so sit down.

14:54.611 --> 14:56.945
I think we're good
with this conversation.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.113
-Are you really good?
-Yes, I'm fine.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.932
All right, well,
I'm gonna go get some water.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.333
Where is everybody?

15:06.039 --> 15:06.988
-See you at 8:00.
-Are you going?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.006
-To bed, yeah.
-Really?

15:08.041 --> 15:08.990
Yeah.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.608
I want a good sleep tonight.

15:10.627 --> 15:13.211
Oh, okay, well, then I guess
I'm also going to bed.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.582
[bleep]

15:22.973 --> 15:24.422
[giggling]

15:36.486 --> 15:38.036
[alarm sounds]

15:47.647 --> 15:50.949
just so you know,
they're doing a partition,

15:50.984 --> 15:53.001
so it's gonna be
one room with...

15:54.153 --> 15:55.453
Yeah, which is really annoying.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.087
Okay.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.122
Dislikes, nothin', okay.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.791
You need to ----ing
highlight that.

15:59.826 --> 16:02.176
Then when he comes to you
and says they don't like this,

16:02.212 --> 16:06.130
you just say, "excuse me, pal...
Dislikes, nothin'."

16:06.165 --> 16:08.850
didn't even put a "g" on the
end, just went for "nothin'."

16:08.885 --> 16:13.004
okay, we'll see, charles,
if you dislike "nothin'."

16:13.023 --> 16:16.441
how do we... Is the curtain just
gonna go around their bed?

16:16.476 --> 16:17.442
Yeah.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.981
Oh, my god.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.532
There we go.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.883
Dais, I got a little
update in a text.

16:25.919 --> 16:27.318
Yeah?

16:27.353 --> 16:29.287
So, I have an update
regarding our guests.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.888
Erica, cindi, and charles
were all removed

16:30.924 --> 16:34.292
from their flight in heathrow
by the metropolitan police.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.893
Erica, cindi, and charles?

16:35.929 --> 16:37.862
"after an issue with the flight
crew, and the result of that,

16:37.881 --> 16:40.581
cindi missed her connecting
flight to menorca."

16:45.071 --> 16:47.204
I told you they were crazy!

16:47.223 --> 16:48.473
Now you sound crazy.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.390
Well...

16:49.426 --> 16:51.676
So, she will be picked up
in the tender

16:51.711 --> 16:54.045
later this afternoon and
brought to the yacht.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.015
-Yeah.
-Right, okay.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.900
I mean, who gets
kicked off a plane?

16:58.935 --> 17:01.586
Well, these guys were taken off
the airplane by police.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.354
That's pretty impressive.
That's some crazy people.

17:03.389 --> 17:04.856
That's serious stuff.

17:08.628 --> 17:12.730
All crew, all crew,
provisions are on the dock.

17:12.766 --> 17:15.083
Ooh, yeah, here we go.

17:18.972 --> 17:20.838
[whistles]

17:20.874 --> 17:24.175
let me grab these, then,
for the refrigerator.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.710
Oh, is this our black cloth?

17:25.745 --> 17:28.629
I'm gonna keep this
for décor tonight.

17:32.952 --> 17:35.920
I'm gonna go do this curtain
thing in the master cabin now.

17:35.939 --> 17:36.954
Do you need help?

17:36.990 --> 17:38.089
Yeah, I probably will need help.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.424
Okay, I'll be done in a moment.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.261
So, how are we gonna hang this?

17:43.296 --> 17:45.396
I'm gonna punch a hole, and then
we're gonna put these in it.

17:45.431 --> 17:48.366
You like to put things
in holes, don't you?

17:49.803 --> 17:50.818
[speaking spanish]

17:50.870 --> 17:53.154
everything is away.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.957
You're stupid.
The bed!

17:55.992 --> 17:57.508
Oh, no!
Crisis.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.410
I think we really need to
do this transom door too,

17:59.445 --> 18:01.579
because glenn said
it a few times.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.086
Okay, now we need
a ----ing door.

18:08.121 --> 18:13.290
Oh, you actually made it look
better than I thought.

18:13.309 --> 18:14.425
Towels, check.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.861
Halyards, I'll do that.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.462
Cool, good work, sister.

18:18.481 --> 18:20.832
-You're welcome, good job.
-Let's high five.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.300
-Thank you.
-Yeah, you're welcome.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.870
That'll do, donkey.
That'll do.

18:28.374 --> 18:29.490
Looks great down here.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.526
-Do you like it?
-Super happy.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.010
Good job.

18:33.046 --> 18:35.113
All right, let's have
a little walkaround.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.914
-Did you guys wash the transom?
-Yeah.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.382
Everything looks good.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.654
That does not look done to me.
This needs to be shiny.

18:43.690 --> 18:47.325
So, no soap, we literally
spray it down and dry it?

18:47.360 --> 18:48.876
Damn it, tom!

18:48.928 --> 18:50.728
Otherwise, I think the boat's
looking good, guys.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.630
Bloody go, team, go.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.182
I'm a rule-follower
for the most part,

18:54.217 --> 18:55.833
and I don't like to
get in trouble.

18:55.852 --> 18:59.370
So, I put a lot of pressure on
myself to be good at what I do.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.722
Oh, that's making it look worse.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.208
They want it dried,
so just do as they said.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.477
All crew, all
crew, everyone dress

19:06.512 --> 19:07.979
and make your way
to the cockpit.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.647
Let's go and get changed,
because honestly,

19:09.682 --> 19:10.982
we're not gonna get
a chance to eat.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.583
But we need to dry this.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.652
Every minute counts.
Every minute counts.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.020
All right, let's go, come on.

19:16.039 --> 19:17.788
Hold on, I'm gonna finish
drying this.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.324
Hey, hey, hey, kelsie,
you're killing me.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.000
Just love me, daisy,
love me.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.218
No! No, you smell.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.536
We can love each other.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.054
No, we can't,
gary, get off of me.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.672
You make me smile, I love you.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.077
<i> Gary, gary, glenn.</i>

19:40.113 --> 19:43.014
Hey, mate, it looks like the
transom hasn't been done at all.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.682
Yes, it has.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.818
Okay, copy, I'll come
and do it.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.088
It needs to be washed, rinsed,
and chamoised dry.

19:51.124 --> 19:52.557
Okay, vamos.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.558
Tom and I just did the transom.

19:54.577 --> 19:56.727
You could do all the work that
needs to make this thing clean.

19:56.746 --> 20:00.397
If it still looks like sh--,
you're not done, right?

20:00.416 --> 20:02.633
Can you grab a chamois.
Have a look at that vang.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.469
Tell me if you think it's clean.

20:05.505 --> 20:09.106
You can't just neglect certain
things on a superyacht.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.108
Okay, so I'll wash and you
rinse directly behind me.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.677
Okay.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.946
I don't want people to do work,
I want results.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.098
Moving forward,
it has to be perfect.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.916
Keep an eye out
for stuff like that.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.587
All crew, I see
the guests coming now.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.289
It does, the water
looks so pretty.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.724
Yeah, it's nice.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.093
Let's get everybody into
the cockpit, please.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.094
The transom is done.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.479
Oh, here they go.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.397
I love my job, I love my job,
I love my job.

20:36.119 --> 20:38.452
Hi.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.343
E.     Everyone get their
water bottles.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.877
All crew, I see the guests.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.714
Let's get everybody up
into the cockpit, please.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.717
Here we go.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.936
-Oh, okay.
-They're walking hand in hand.

20:54.971 --> 20:55.953
Shh, shh, shh.

20:55.989 --> 20:56.637
I'm at the end.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.023
-Hey, guys.
-How you doing?

20:59.058 --> 21:00.625
Hi, erica, welcome back.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.310
Hello.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.794
Oh, yeah, definitely.
How are you?

21:03.830 --> 21:05.463
I'm daisy, nice to meet you.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.814
-Nice to see you.
-This is my husband, charles.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.132
-I'm captain glenn.
-Nice to meet you.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.333
Just head up the gangway

21:09.369 --> 21:10.785
and just kick your shoes
off at the top.

21:10.820 --> 21:13.037
It feels more fancy walking
around without shoes on.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.456
-Hi.
-Hello!

21:15.491 --> 21:17.875
-Here you go.
-I'm rhett, nice to meet you.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.143
-Marcos, nice to meet you.
-Are you the chef?

21:19.178 --> 21:20.461
-Yes.
-Oh, my gosh.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.313
-Now the fun part begins.
-Yeah, exactly.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.714
Here's to an amazing...

21:26.452 --> 21:27.752
-Cheers!
-I'm excited.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.886
L'chaim!

21:28.921 --> 21:30.988
We're happy to welcome
you guys all on board.

21:31.024 --> 21:32.956
We're looking forward to getting
cindi back on board.

21:32.976 --> 21:33.724
Yes.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.343
We'll organize that, no problem.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.494
She's coming,
she's on her way.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.145
Fantastic.

21:38.181 --> 21:40.965
In the meantime, daisy's gonna
take you guys for a little tour.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.833
Here, we have flybridge.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.569
So, we just hang out here
and get drunk at the bar?

21:45.605 --> 21:47.321
Okay, let's organize
the luggage.

21:47.357 --> 21:48.689
Boom.

21:48.741 --> 21:49.974
And you obviously have
the main saloon here.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.909
This is a nice area
to cool down in.

21:51.944 --> 21:54.111
One of these days
we'll own our own yacht,

21:54.146 --> 21:56.347
and it's gonna be
bigger than this.

21:56.382 --> 21:58.883
If we go on down here,
we'll go down to the cabins.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.951
In here, we've got
the two twins.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.753
So, these two rooms
are identical.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.789
These guys have more luggage
for their three days

22:04.824 --> 22:07.191
than I brought for this
whole charter season.

22:07.226 --> 22:08.876
This is the master cabin.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.545
I know you requested
the room to be split, and...

22:11.597 --> 22:12.797
Oh, this is perfect.

22:12.832 --> 22:13.931
Yeah?

22:13.966 --> 22:15.566
-So, I know him and I...
-Chuck and I will be right here.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.184
Yeah, so we...

22:17.220 --> 22:19.170
Because while the kids are away,
we're gonna be having some sex.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.354
Blegh.

22:20.390 --> 22:22.506
Eugh, god.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.025
This is where I slept last time.

22:24.060 --> 22:25.776
This is the other
best couple's spot.

22:25.812 --> 22:26.644
Come on!

22:26.679 --> 22:28.646
Whoever's in here,
like, I'm loud.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.197
I can go in there,
I don't care what y'all do.

22:30.233 --> 22:32.199
I have headphones,
I'm cool, dude.

22:32.235 --> 22:33.451
I'm a grouch in the morning.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.202
-Is that the last one?
-Yeah.

22:35.238 --> 22:37.204
So, my mom's coming late
because down at the airport,

22:37.240 --> 22:38.706
it was a drama.

22:38.741 --> 22:40.207
So, what happened,
did you have an argument?

22:40.243 --> 22:42.192
So, like, chuck and I had
upgraded to first class,

22:42.211 --> 22:44.211
so she was in economy
comfort or whatever.

22:44.247 --> 22:46.697
She was like, "can I have an
omelette, I don't like yoghurt,"

22:46.716 --> 22:48.215
or whatever, and the girl
was like, "no."

22:48.251 --> 22:51.034
and then chuck was sleeping, she
had served chuck his omelette,

22:51.054 --> 22:52.753
and my mom just snuck
in there and took it.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.722
-And I rise...
-Yeah.

22:54.757 --> 22:56.206
In business class to three cops.

22:56.225 --> 22:57.475
-Yeah.
-Fully armed.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.343
All because my mom
ate his omelette.

22:59.378 --> 23:03.013
I...
I don't have words.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.765
You guys are gonna have a
great charter, drama-free.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.049
We're so excited.

23:06.069 --> 23:08.486
All righty,
I'm gonna fire up now.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.720
Go ahead, pull.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.489
-Nice.
-Get the bowline off.

23:11.524 --> 23:12.523
Okay.

23:12.558 --> 23:13.591
Thank you.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.860
All lines clear.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.595
Main is off now.

23:20.116 --> 23:21.031
"come to my yacht,"

23:21.066 --> 23:24.168
and I'm like,
"that's a houseboat."

23:24.203 --> 23:27.671
crostini with garlic shrimp,
avocado, and tomato salsa.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.407
So, he's a gemini, chuck.

23:29.442 --> 23:32.476
Yeah, I think I'm a gemini,
and I have a libra ascendant,

23:32.512 --> 23:35.112
so I come of as
a very peaceful dude.

23:35.148 --> 23:36.280
I'm a libra.

23:36.315 --> 23:37.965
When really, I'm crazier than...

23:39.685 --> 23:40.918
Where should I put these?

23:40.953 --> 23:42.119
Just put these
in the bridge for now.

23:42.155 --> 23:43.087
-Okay.
-Oh, my god.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.755
Thank you.
-That is so good.

23:44.774 --> 23:46.273
Neither of my hands
have any champagne,

23:46.309 --> 23:47.608
so can I go pour one,
or do y'all get to do it?

23:47.643 --> 23:49.110
No, but let me do that, please.

23:49.145 --> 23:50.995
-That's my girl.
-I think that's us good for now.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.197
You go on your break,
and I'll see you at 11:00.

23:55.451 --> 23:56.567
Yes.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.622
Can you please send ashley to go
and start unpacking her bags?

24:01.657 --> 24:02.957
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

24:02.992 --> 24:04.308
Mm-hmm.

24:04.343 --> 24:06.310
Interior, galley, we're gonna
start getting sails up now.

24:06.345 --> 24:07.962
Copy.

24:07.997 --> 24:11.315
Ashley, can you please go
start unpacking the master?

24:11.350 --> 24:12.833
Yeah.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.452
Let's get somebody up to
call the mizzen, please.

24:15.471 --> 24:16.821
I feel like this is
probably, like,

24:16.856 --> 24:18.139
the perfect amount of wind.

24:18.174 --> 24:19.173
Hold.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.492
Okay, that's good,
let's go to the main.

24:21.527 --> 24:22.827
What flag is that?

24:22.862 --> 24:24.328
That looks like a british flag.

24:24.363 --> 24:27.865
So, we're in England, guys.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.684
-Two wraps left.
-Gonna be sailing good soon.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.653
Hold, that looks good.

24:32.688 --> 24:34.688
Okay, you can start unfurling.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.991
This might be quite
a nice sail, actually.

24:37.026 --> 24:39.777
Ooh, we're gonna heel,
we're gonna heel.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.665
So, we're using the complete
sails now, no engine?

24:44.700 --> 24:46.784
Yeah, engines off,
this is just sailing.

24:51.207 --> 24:54.358
Okay, here we go.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.193
Oh, wow, look at this.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.345
[bleep] me, man.

24:58.381 --> 25:01.348
Jesus.

25:01.384 --> 25:03.534
Sh--.

25:03.569 --> 25:06.270
Okay, that's enough.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.506
Oh, my gosh, holy crap.

25:08.541 --> 25:09.773
Fail number one.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.725
Let's get a sheet
in a little bit.

25:20.703 --> 25:22.352
Oh, my god.

25:22.371 --> 25:23.787
Ah.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.372
Amazing, come out
of the channel,

25:25.408 --> 25:27.391
-and the wind dies.
-Yeah.

25:27.426 --> 25:28.926
And this is cool, I don't know
why everybody

25:28.961 --> 25:31.829
wants to chill upstairs.
I just chill in here.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.380
On our honeymoon,
they had some stone crab

25:33.416 --> 25:34.915
at a steakhouse in houston.

25:34.967 --> 25:35.833
Mm-hmm?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.218
I must have bought,
like, 12 of 'em.

25:37.253 --> 25:38.385
Yeah.

25:38.421 --> 25:39.887
And they were,
like, 20 bucks each.

25:39.922 --> 25:41.555
It's a very annoying price
fluctuation

25:41.591 --> 25:43.557
due to the influx of all
the snowbirds all year.

25:43.593 --> 25:44.909
Yeah.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.061
I definitely missed café
con leche and a colada,

25:47.096 --> 25:49.680
and all the different variations
of cuban espresso.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.181
I'm a very good tipper,
always have been.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.601
I have, like $3,000 in hundreds
for y'all.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.218
And the most annoying
thing about florida

25:55.238 --> 25:57.721
is the damn toll pays.

25:57.740 --> 26:00.574
Oh, my god,
please pray for my sanity.

26:00.610 --> 26:02.910
I might lose
my sh-- this charter.

26:02.945 --> 26:05.362
Everybody thinks that
I'm freaking psycho

26:05.397 --> 26:06.580
frustrating.

26:06.616 --> 26:08.032
I'd prefer to be
feared than loved.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.951
You gotta go check
out the views up there.

26:11.003 --> 26:14.255
-All right.
-Okay.

26:14.290 --> 26:15.923
Okay, tom,
you're calling the mizzen.

26:15.958 --> 26:18.142
We'll drop 'em at the same time.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.927
Are you happy where
the luff is sitting?

26:19.962 --> 26:21.095
Yeah.

26:21.130 --> 26:22.930
Don't like tomato,
only eat chicken,

26:22.965 --> 26:24.965
fish, or steak, no lobster.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.718
<i> You can drop, drop, we gotta</i>
<i> go to one and a half.</i>

26:27.753 --> 26:29.937
Galveston's not quite like this.

26:29.972 --> 26:31.789
It's literally,
like, poop water.

26:31.824 --> 26:35.292
<i> That's one and a half.</i>
<i> Good, well done.</i>

26:35.328 --> 26:36.777
-Tom?
-Yes.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.279
Is that swim platform open?

26:38.314 --> 26:40.648
-I'm going on it now, yeah.
-Excellent, thanks.

26:47.373 --> 26:50.874
-Glenn...
-[clattering]

26:52.611 --> 26:53.994
[bleep] me.

26:55.498 --> 26:57.081
Coming up...

26:57.116 --> 26:59.750
I'm not gonna eat that,
because that's gross.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.085
He is so full of sh--.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.420
I've gotten better food
at the ballpark.

27:07.559 --> 27:08.425
-Glenn...
-[clattering]

27:12.398 --> 27:14.181
[bleep] me.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.482
You'll drag the ----ing...

27:15.518 --> 27:17.501
Have you seen the marks
where the pins come out?

27:17.536 --> 27:19.370
Yeah, don't make it into a big
deal, it's not a big deal.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.205
-It is, you've got...
-I... I stopped...

27:21.240 --> 27:22.506
I heard it, I've stopped,
we've pulled them in.

27:22.541 --> 27:24.074
You've gotta do the pins first.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.876
I did do the pin, I just didn't
hold it for long enough.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.911
-Good, that's it.
-What the [bleep]?

27:27.947 --> 27:29.747
I'm not liking this
attitude right now.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.515
If you try to open the
transom door

27:31.550 --> 27:35.169
with the pins locked into it,
it can destroy the door,

27:35.204 --> 27:37.504
and then we can't take people
on and off the boat.

27:37.540 --> 27:40.040
It's a serious thing.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.881
Okay, girl.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.768
Ah, so fun.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.470
-Whoa, whoa, whoa...
-Jesus, easy, papi.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.893
Well, let's just get it
in ----ing...

27:59.945 --> 28:01.812
Yeah, but, I mean, you're gonna
break something in there, bro.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.647
For [bleep]'s sake.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.149
Just take it easy.

28:09.205 --> 28:10.454
Want to change into your wets?

28:10.489 --> 28:11.455
Yeah.

28:11.490 --> 28:12.389
Gary, gary, glenn.

28:12.425 --> 28:14.858
The last guest
is ready to be picked up.

28:14.877 --> 28:16.377
Copy.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.276
It is so freaking beautiful.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.811
I mean, it's gorgeous, right?

28:33.846 --> 28:35.396
Tom, you wanna come
down here for a sec?

28:35.431 --> 28:36.847
Yeah.

28:39.418 --> 28:40.234
What?

28:40.269 --> 28:42.152
Well, you got
a bit upset over here.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.737
In my head we stopped,
I heard it,

28:43.773 --> 28:45.222
and then I adjusted,
and it was fine.

28:45.241 --> 28:47.057
I get it...
If the door doesn't open,

28:47.076 --> 28:48.275
the pins break,
then we haven't got a door...

28:48.327 --> 28:50.227
You... You...
You ----ed up the paint.

28:50.246 --> 28:52.112
It's, like, little things
on superyachts,

28:52.164 --> 28:54.898
so just trying to adjust
to being very finicky,

28:54.934 --> 28:56.917
the small details count
a lot, you know?

28:56.952 --> 28:58.585
Even though I don't have
much sailing experience,

28:58.621 --> 29:01.588
when it comes to superyachts,
I'm not a ----ing moron.

29:01.624 --> 29:03.574
You're gonna have
to make that adjustment.

29:03.609 --> 29:04.808
Yeah, I...

29:04.844 --> 29:06.176
Or else there's
gonna be problems.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.845
There's gonna be tiny things
that we forget,

29:07.880 --> 29:09.263
so just be patient with me,

29:09.298 --> 29:11.131
because I don't
know the boat yet.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.382
[bleep].

29:12.417 --> 29:14.184
Anyway, as long as we're cool,
that's the main thing.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.603
No, of course we are, yeah.

29:16.639 --> 29:18.355
-Cheers.
-Cheers, mate.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.607
All good.

29:20.643 --> 29:22.159
-Yeah.
-Hello, cindi.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.761
Welcome.

29:23.796 --> 29:24.962
Thank you.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.631
-There we go, lovely.
-Yay.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.099
Glenn, glenn, gary.

29:29.118 --> 29:30.801
I'm coming around.

29:30.836 --> 29:33.287
All crew, all crew, tender's
on its way back with one guest.

29:33.322 --> 29:34.638
Thank you.

29:34.673 --> 29:37.174
Should we go down
to the swim platform?

29:38.844 --> 29:39.877
Here we go.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.378
Can help her get off.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.630
Hello, how are you,
I'm tom, nice to meet you.

29:43.666 --> 29:44.982
Ugh.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.383
-How you doing, cindi?
-I'm good.

29:46.418 --> 29:47.835
So nice to see you again,
welcome back aboard.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.386
Nice to see you.

29:49.421 --> 29:50.654
Thank you, I'm excited,
it's just gorgeous.

29:50.689 --> 29:52.289
They're waiting for
you just up the stairs.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.792
You take that one,
I'll get these.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.026
I'm gabriela.

29:56.061 --> 29:57.027
Cindi, nice to meet
you, gabriela.

29:57.062 --> 29:58.428
Nice to meet you.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.130
I think there's
a few guests up in the bow.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.199
Let's see if we know
what cabin you're in,

30:02.234 --> 30:03.667
and you obviously know the boat.

30:03.702 --> 30:05.035
Hi.

30:05.070 --> 30:06.837
Yeah, I'll grab that one.

30:06.872 --> 30:09.022
You and susan have your whole
room, just the two of you.

30:09.074 --> 30:10.357
Do you want me to
go down real quick

30:10.409 --> 30:12.526
and ask her
if the menu's okay?

30:12.578 --> 30:15.579
Yeah, so it's gonna
be watermelon gazpacho,

30:15.614 --> 30:17.331
and then it's gonna
be entrecôte...

30:17.366 --> 30:18.215
Yeah?

30:18.250 --> 30:20.918
With potato gratin and
broccoli mousse.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.152
-Okay.
-You remember that?

30:22.188 --> 30:23.420
Let me go check... Yeah.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.122
Mom, look, I put
my own eyelashes on.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.857
-They look good.
-I'm so proud of you.

30:26.892 --> 30:28.358
Thanks.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.561
Can I interrupt so quickly?

30:30.596 --> 30:32.129
I just wanna double-check
the dinner menu...

30:32.164 --> 30:33.463
-Yeah.
-For this evening...

30:33.498 --> 30:35.065
-Okay, yeah.
-So the chef can get ready.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.017
What he was proposing was
watermelon gazpachio...

30:37.052 --> 30:38.552
Gazpacho?

30:38.604 --> 30:41.688
Entrecôte with potato gratin
and a broccoli mousse.

30:41.724 --> 30:44.107
Mm.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.143
The entrecôte,
so that's beef.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.480
No gazpacho?
Would you...

30:50.515 --> 30:52.149
Well, not with
watermelon in it.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.151
If you want a different type
of food, request it now.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.153
No, I don't need anything,
I really don't.

30:56.188 --> 30:59.072
Just tell me what
the [bleep] you want.

31:01.744 --> 31:03.210
Okay.
Um... Okay.

31:03.245 --> 31:05.245
Sounds like we're just
eating a bunch of crap.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.414
There's definitely tension.

31:07.466 --> 31:10.050
I'm trying to hold it all
as long as possible

31:10.085 --> 31:14.504
because it's gonna be me who
has to ----ing deal with it.

31:17.509 --> 31:20.677
Charles and cindi don't
like the sound

31:20.713 --> 31:22.262
of the watermelon gazpachio.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.932
Okay, I change it.
I just gonna make a salad.

31:24.984 --> 31:27.150
For cindi, maybe,
just do the steak,

31:27.186 --> 31:29.519
like, a small steak for her
with some vegetables.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.154
She doesn't seem like
she wants to eat carbs.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.323
-Everything else is fine.
-Okay.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.192
You can actually start
pulling dinner.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.394
Did the scotch come,
macallan 18?

31:37.413 --> 31:38.595
-Yeah.
-Okay, great.

31:38.631 --> 31:39.596
Have it in the...

31:39.632 --> 31:41.198
If you guys are worried
about, like, the menu,

31:41.233 --> 31:43.400
we should talk about it
with the chef.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.168
-We can go down.
-Yeah, should we do that?

31:49.675 --> 31:50.774
-Hello.
-The chef!

31:50.809 --> 31:52.209
-Hello.
-How you doing, guys?

31:52.244 --> 31:53.627
We wanted to go over
the menu again.

31:53.679 --> 31:54.878
So, you guys don't
want gazpacho, so...

31:54.914 --> 31:56.280
The gazpacho...

31:56.315 --> 31:57.281
I'm gonna change it
to a salad, so...

31:57.316 --> 31:59.016
-Okay.
-Yeah.

31:59.051 --> 32:00.417
I'm making a broccoli mousse.

32:00.436 --> 32:01.885
I don't know about "mousse."

32:01.920 --> 32:05.188
is there any way to make it,
like, not like a mousse?

32:05.224 --> 32:09.276
Oh, now I see what
daisy's talking about.

32:09.311 --> 32:11.662
Could you do either,
like, brussels in balsamic

32:11.697 --> 32:13.163
or some other type
of brussel...

32:13.198 --> 32:14.615
Oh, like, grilled,
grilled vegetables.

32:14.650 --> 32:16.450
Just because you're
wearing fancy clothes

32:16.485 --> 32:19.703
and you rent a boat doesn't mean
you have fancy taste buds.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.271
They don't know
sh-- about the food.

32:21.290 --> 32:24.174
I like my steak medium-plus,
no pink.

32:24.209 --> 32:26.159
Yeah, no, I got...
Oh, medium-plus.

32:26.211 --> 32:27.244
-Okay, good.
-Yeah, no pink.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.245
-Okay.
-Okay, thank you.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.246
See you later.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.580
Thank you, chef, appreciate it.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.668
All right,
they make it easy for me.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.386
Thank you very much.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.422
Scotch and steak theme.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.176
I'm gonna go shower
real fast so that...

32:43.228 --> 32:44.661
And I'm gonna go change, too.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.837
I keep on making small mistakes
I would never usually make.

32:53.872 --> 32:55.072
Same.
Think you're tired?

32:55.107 --> 32:57.140
No.
I want people to like me.

32:57.159 --> 32:58.825
Like, I do.

32:58.861 --> 33:00.377
Everybody does like you.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.030
Were you there when
I snapped at ashley yesterday?

33:03.082 --> 33:04.581
Yeah.

33:04.616 --> 33:08.085
See, I made a mistake,
and I embarrassed myself

33:09.621 --> 33:11.321
yeah, exactly.

33:12.791 --> 33:13.857
[speaking spanish]

33:15.678 --> 33:16.843
do you want me to
do that for you?

33:16.879 --> 33:17.844
Yeah.

33:17.880 --> 33:20.497
I don't really want to, but...

33:20.532 --> 33:21.865
-You want crème brûlée?
-Yes!

33:21.900 --> 33:23.633
-I'll wash dishes.
-Then wash... Okay.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.357
Okay.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.110
Do you want me to spray
you with some stuff?

33:33.145 --> 33:34.861
No, I'm good.

33:34.897 --> 33:36.063
You want finishing spray?

33:36.115 --> 33:37.731
-Yeah.
-Beautiful!

33:37.783 --> 33:39.616
-That's really, really pretty.
-I think this is enough.

33:39.651 --> 33:42.519
I'm ready to take on the night.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.288
-Hey, how are you?
-Ooh, look at you!

33:45.324 --> 33:47.124
In my little handmade dress.

33:47.159 --> 33:48.858
I like it,
it's really nice.

33:48.877 --> 33:49.859
Thank you.

33:49.878 --> 33:51.244
Would you like a drink?

33:51.296 --> 33:54.364
Sure, you recommend
whatever you like to make.

33:54.383 --> 33:55.599
Vodka, or what are we thinking?

33:55.634 --> 33:57.384
Whatever's the least fattening.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.906
You get a workout.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.108
I know, honestly,
I don't work out otherwise.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.109
Yeah, you just...

34:06.145 --> 34:07.711
Uh-huh, you get a workout in.

34:09.681 --> 34:13.683
Whenever you wanna
sit down for dinner.

34:13.718 --> 34:15.051
Oh, jeez.

34:15.070 --> 34:17.354
Oh, my god
this is ----ing...

34:17.389 --> 34:19.072
Holy sh-- dude.

34:19.108 --> 34:20.590
So gross.

34:20.626 --> 34:21.908
Mom, we saved you a
seat right in the middle.

34:21.944 --> 34:24.861
Oh, man.
Oh.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.913
Okay, marcos,
they're sitting at the table.

34:26.949 --> 34:29.116
Thank you.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.468
Okay, smile.

34:31.503 --> 34:32.569
Are you gonna come up
with each course?

34:32.604 --> 34:34.287
-Yeah.
-Okay, great.

34:34.339 --> 34:35.589
It's a man's dinner tonight.

34:35.624 --> 34:37.541
-These ready?
-Yeah.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.045
This looks so pretty.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.181
This is a mushroom salad,
truffle,

34:44.216 --> 34:45.849
balsamic vinegar, and olive oil.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.518
-It's really good.
-It's good.

34:48.554 --> 34:49.553
This is, like, the best
salad I've ever eaten.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.754
Thank you, thank you so much.

34:50.789 --> 34:51.938
You did a pretty
good job, brother.

34:51.974 --> 34:53.190
All right, let's keep going.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.308
-This is so good.
-Enjoy it.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.477
I need a gummy bear
or something.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.729
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm, mm-mmm.

34:59.764 --> 35:00.947
It's so smooth, this stuff.

35:00.983 --> 35:02.265
Cheers, guys.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.668
How do we say
"cheers" in spanish?

35:04.703 --> 35:05.702
-Salud.
-Salud!

35:05.737 --> 35:06.736
L'chaim!

35:09.158 --> 35:11.708
-Oh, thank you.
-Sorry.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.960
Okay, that's starters cleared.
Whenever you're ready, yeah.

35:13.996 --> 35:18.298
Okay.

35:18.333 --> 35:19.683
I can't wait to try his steak.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.668
-They all loved it.
-Yeah?

35:21.720 --> 35:22.652
Yeah.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.221
-Two medium-rare.
-They're ready to go?

35:24.256 --> 35:25.222
Yeah.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.556
One medium-well.

35:26.592 --> 35:27.991
Do you want me to bring
that up, dais, or...

35:28.026 --> 35:29.976
Yeah, just know what it is.

35:30.012 --> 35:33.363
A medium-well for halhe.

35:33.398 --> 35:34.364
Thank you.

35:34.399 --> 35:36.500
Ooh, the steak is coming, babe.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.352
-For you.
-Thank you.

35:39.404 --> 35:41.738
And there, for erica,
medium, medium, medium.

35:43.408 --> 35:44.941
There you go.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.446
So, we have grilled vegetable
that I kinda make it

35:49.481 --> 35:51.615
like a ratatouille, and
I marinade the steak

35:51.650 --> 35:54.584
with chive-garlic-mustard dijon.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.286
It started off at first
I was like, wait a minute,

35:56.321 --> 35:57.754
I don't know if I liked it,
but I just ate a piece of fat.

35:57.789 --> 35:58.672
Oh, yeah.

35:58.707 --> 36:00.624
Then I got to the meat,
then I'm like,

36:00.659 --> 36:02.008
-all right, good, good, good.
-Oh, wait, okay.

36:02.044 --> 36:03.226
-It's really good.
-It's really good.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.544
So, actually, I hate to do this,

36:04.596 --> 36:06.029
but I don't like any
pink in my steak.

36:06.064 --> 36:07.330
You want it more cooked?

36:07.366 --> 36:08.331
Yeah, I like it,
like, completely dark.

36:08.367 --> 36:09.332
Okay.

36:09.368 --> 36:12.185
Ah [bleep].

36:12.221 --> 36:14.521
I don't like steak at all raw.

36:19.627 --> 36:21.311
I don't like
any pink in my steak.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.512
You want it more cooked?

36:22.548 --> 36:23.930
Yeah, I like it, like...
Completely dark.

36:23.966 --> 36:26.716
I like my steak medium-plus,
no pink.

36:26.752 --> 36:27.717
Okay.

36:27.753 --> 36:29.919
Sh--.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.521
I got you.

36:31.557 --> 36:32.956
Such a waste of a quality
piece of meat right there.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.958
She don't want it medium,
she want it medium-well.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.393
Oh.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.595
In my mind,
my job have to be perfect.

36:38.614 --> 36:39.946
This cannot happen again.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.733
Good thing I like vegetables.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.654
Girl, throwing out that shade.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.674
I like steak a few
times a year.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.375
Mom, you always
eat a good steak.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.376
That's not true.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.629
Who was that?

36:55.664 --> 36:57.330
Who sent that back?
Erica.

36:57.382 --> 37:00.834
Okay, this plate is hot, okay?

37:00.886 --> 37:02.519
This is a man's dinner,
it's not women's food.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.953
It's delicious.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.923
Well, I loved it,
I thought it was fantastic.

37:08.527 --> 37:10.343
Do you want my steak?

37:10.395 --> 37:12.979
Ooh, this looks perfect.

37:13.015 --> 37:14.531
This is good for me.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.899
Yum.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.000
What a ----ing day.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.985
-You finish cabins?
-Yeah.

37:19.021 --> 37:20.837
-Good job.
-Yeah.

37:22.324 --> 37:24.908
-Lovely dinner, everyone.
-This was amazing.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.444
That was just about the top
five dinner in my life.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.248
Erica, I wanted to talk to
you about tomorrow as well.

37:31.283 --> 37:33.416
-Okay.
-You have a brunch picnic.

37:33.452 --> 37:34.884
We're going night-night.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.819
Do you want that to be,
like, breakfast and lunch?

37:36.838 --> 37:39.289
-I think so.
-Yeah, like, 11:00ish?

37:39.324 --> 37:40.690
-Yes, that's perfect.
-Okay.

37:40.726 --> 37:41.675
Okay, great.

37:41.710 --> 37:42.842
-Okay.
-Woohoo, I'm excited.

37:42.878 --> 37:45.195
-See you bright and early.
-Later.

37:45.230 --> 37:46.713
Tom pearson out.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.566
I couldn't get it up
right now if you paid me.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.151
Not after drinking all day.

37:51.203 --> 37:53.336
Ah...

37:53.372 --> 37:55.005
Good night, thank you
for all your help.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.373
Of course, thank you.

37:56.408 --> 37:59.476
So, brunch tomorrow
at the beach at 11:00,

37:59.511 --> 38:01.277
so no breakfast and no lunch.

38:01.296 --> 38:02.779
-Perfect.
-See you in the morning.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.481
We've got a pretty
good anchorage.

38:04.516 --> 38:07.400
We could possibly go around
like this, in a circle.

38:07.452 --> 38:09.018
Do you know how to do
the log every hour?

38:09.037 --> 38:10.287
Yep.

38:13.358 --> 38:15.525
-Good night, sleep tight.
-Good night.

38:15.544 --> 38:17.043
Okay. Good night.

38:37.432 --> 38:38.431
How was your night shift?

38:38.483 --> 38:40.817
It flew by.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.692
All right, good luck out there.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.661
-Go sleep well.
-Break a leg, love you.

38:52.614 --> 38:53.930
This is okay for the brunch.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.165
What are you doing?

38:55.200 --> 38:57.667
Fruit platter, smoked salmon,
cheese platter, scramble...

38:57.703 --> 38:59.502
Oh, breakfast burrito also?

38:59.538 --> 39:02.422
Messing up erica's steak
last night really sucks.

39:02.457 --> 39:05.508
I need to pay very close
attention from now on.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.014
All right, I think it's good.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.115
All right.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.717
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.819
You guys are gonna go to the
beach and have brunch today.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.103
We are, I think,
like, at 11:00.

39:17.139 --> 39:18.555
Yeah.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.256
I drank a whole bottle
of scotch last night,

39:20.275 --> 39:23.059
so I need food now or it's just
gonna get ugly for everybody.

39:23.095 --> 39:24.594
You guys can eat.

39:24.613 --> 39:25.862
Good morning, sunshine.

39:31.069 --> 39:34.037
The chef is happy to get you
something, it's no issue at all.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.121
If you let me know,

39:35.157 --> 39:36.873
I can go down and let
him know what you'd like.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.743
What would you like?
I don't know.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.127
Would you like an
omelette,

39:41.163 --> 39:43.296
would you like a breakfast
sandwich or a burrito?

39:43.331 --> 39:44.497
Yeah, an omelette's fine,
an omelette's fine,

39:44.549 --> 39:45.882
an omelette's fine.

39:45.917 --> 39:48.551
-So, you...
-Yeah, an omelette's fine.

39:48.587 --> 39:49.586
An omelette, okay.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.087
And anything in your omelette?

39:51.123 --> 39:52.756
Bacon, onions, cheese.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.624
Okay, perfect,
I'll get you that now for you.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.125
I am so confused.

39:56.144 --> 39:59.028
Not only was this given to me
on the preference sheet,

39:59.064 --> 40:01.765
but I also confirmed
with the co-primary,

40:01.800 --> 40:03.850
who happens to be your wife...

40:03.902 --> 40:04.901
Morning.

40:06.338 --> 40:07.320
I can get you anything you like.

40:07.355 --> 40:08.354
What would you like?

40:08.407 --> 40:09.739
I like bacon and poached eggs.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.107
-Okay.
-Yeah.

40:11.143 --> 40:12.992
I'll get that for
you now, cindi.

40:13.028 --> 40:14.577
So, what we're gonna do, tom,

40:14.613 --> 40:16.179
we're gonna go to the beach now

40:16.214 --> 40:17.747
and we're gonna leave
you there to set up.

40:17.783 --> 40:18.815
Yep.

40:18.834 --> 40:21.084
Charles would like an
omelette with some bacon,

40:21.119 --> 40:24.087
cheese, and onion, just
some normal stuff like that.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.088
Okay.

40:25.123 --> 40:28.458
Cindi would like poached eggs
and some bacon.

40:28.493 --> 40:30.126
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.094
Okay.

40:34.499 --> 40:35.932
What can I get you?

40:35.967 --> 40:38.000
If you can get into
the cabins, that's great.

40:38.019 --> 40:40.854
Okay.

40:40.889 --> 40:42.439
Whew.

40:42.474 --> 40:46.075
<i> Anybody, food is ready.</i>

40:46.111 --> 40:47.193
Thank you very much.

40:47.229 --> 40:49.779
I think the guests
are gonna go at 11:00.

40:49.815 --> 40:50.647
[bleep]

40:50.682 --> 40:52.398
there's your omelette.

40:52.451 --> 40:53.817
Perfect.

40:53.852 --> 40:54.951
Very nice.

40:56.905 --> 40:58.822
Charles, can I get
you anything?

40:58.857 --> 41:00.824
He's, like, examining
what's not in there.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.695
Would you like another one?

41:06.531 --> 41:09.082
So, bacon, cheese...

41:09.134 --> 41:10.533
Well, I'll eat some
of this, since...

41:10.552 --> 41:11.885
-Yeah, you can have it.
-[bleep] me.

41:11.920 --> 41:13.236
I don't like tomatoes
in my omelette.

41:13.271 --> 41:15.472
He's upset that there's
tomatoes in it,

41:15.507 --> 41:18.141
so he'd like just bacon,
egg, and cheese.

41:18.176 --> 41:20.977
This food is a three
out of one to 10.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.413
This is like chili's or
any, like, fast food...

41:23.448 --> 41:25.014
I don't even think
it's as good as chili's.

41:25.049 --> 41:26.983
Unfortunately, the
steak was disgusting.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.184
But you...

41:28.219 --> 41:29.819
But you said first it was bad,
then you said it was good.

41:29.855 --> 41:31.187
Because I didn't wanna be mean.

41:31.222 --> 41:32.555
And then I was
a little wasted last night.

41:32.574 --> 41:33.690
He meant it was worse than bad.

41:33.725 --> 41:35.391
-Yeah.
-It was bad.

41:35.410 --> 41:36.726
That was disgusting.

41:36.745 --> 41:37.744
It was like
a flank steak or something.

41:37.779 --> 41:39.612
-Ready.
-Thank you.

41:39.664 --> 41:40.830
You're welcome.

41:43.285 --> 41:45.902
Oh, so, daisy, my mom and chuck
have been disappointed.

41:45.937 --> 41:47.604
Don't say you weren't
because I'll be mad.

41:47.639 --> 41:48.972
-No, it's not disappointed...
-Don't say you weren't.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.256
It's more like disgusted.

41:50.292 --> 41:51.674
They've been
disappointed by the food.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.426
Disgusted.

41:53.461 --> 41:56.212
Let's just try here, let's taste
this and see if this is putrid.

41:56.247 --> 41:57.630
The guy is just an asshole.

41:57.682 --> 41:59.382
He's a child.

41:59.417 --> 42:01.217
Yeah, I don't like this either.
I don't like this either.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.419
He is so full of sh--.

42:03.438 --> 42:06.022
Marcos' food is not disgusting.

42:06.057 --> 42:07.974
He was raving
about it last night.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.276
That was just about
the top five dinner in my life.

42:10.312 --> 42:12.962
Yeah, I'm not gonna eat that
either, because that's gross.

42:12.998 --> 42:15.231
This guy is looking
for a fight.

42:15.266 --> 42:19.285
He's uncultured,
unmannered, untraveled.

42:19.321 --> 42:21.621
Chuck, go [bleep] yourself.

42:21.656 --> 42:23.840
I've gotten better food
at the ballpark.

42:28.179 --> 42:30.146
Next, on "below deck
sailing yacht"...

42:30.181 --> 42:31.814
If people don't like
the way I act,

42:31.850 --> 42:33.550
then they don't need to be
around.

42:33.585 --> 42:34.884
It's not doing anything.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.924
I wasn't sitting on the couch.

42:40.959 --> 42:42.325
Ow sh--!

42:42.360 --> 42:43.760
-I cut my head.
-Oh sh--.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.662
Marcos hit his head really bad

42:45.697 --> 42:47.196
and I don't really
know what to do.

42:47.232 --> 42:48.298
-What?
-Oh sh--.

42:48.333 --> 42:49.465
He's taken his scalp off.

42:49.501 --> 42:50.567
Whew.

42:50.602 --> 42:51.734
Who're you gonna hook up with?

42:51.770 --> 42:53.903
-You.
-----Ing hell.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.321
Ah!
