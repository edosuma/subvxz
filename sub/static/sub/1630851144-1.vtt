Nompumelelo, my child,

00:47.255 --> 00:50.109
from today you're no longer

"What's happening?"

his last day,
sick as anything…

06:10.995 --> 06:14.515

06:19.462 --> 06:20.902
[Nompumelelo] Hmm.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.906
Then he showed me
around the city like it was his.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.809
I'll never
forget that place.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.745
Then a year and a half…

the rejection letter in her hand,

06:48.407 --> 06:49.909

16:03.504 --> 16:06.784
Mother, what kills me
is that you just watched.

16:07.174 --> 16:10.934
You watched me suffer that rejection
on top of Dad's death.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.658
You watched me go through my life
thinking I wasn't good enough.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.725
You just… you watched!

16:16.809 --> 16:18.978
I had to protect you.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.271
Protect this family.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.401
You are being
selfish right now.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.553
I don't even know
why you're complaining.

16:29.071 --> 16:32.199
Now, I'm sorry I lied
to you, but I had to.

16:32.282 --> 16:35.327
And one day you
will thank me for it.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.705
You have a husband.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.557
You have it all.

16:39.581 --> 16:44.381
Ma, <i>you</i>
have it all, because this is what I want!

16:46.630 --> 16:48.632
You'll find
me in the car.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.509
[in IsiZulu] Goodbye, Ma.

16:53.303 --> 16:57.766
[woman speaking
softly on radio]

16:57.850 --> 17:01.090
<i>We must acknowledge</i>
<i>the violence of Apartheid…</i>

17:02.688 --> 17:04.728
So none of this
is what you want?

17:07.151 --> 17:10.871
I don't mean it like that.
I just don't want it like this.

17:11.655 --> 17:14.050
Look, don't you see
this changes everything?

17:14.074 --> 17:16.702
How? The letter's
nine years old, Mpumi.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.888
But it proves that
what I see in me is valid,

17:18.912 --> 17:21.248
that what my dad
saw in me is valid.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.931
I'm good, Tumelo, I'm…

17:24.293 --> 17:26.378
I'm crazy good.

17:26.462 --> 17:30.302
So, so what are you saying,
that you want to go to Juilliard?

17:30.841 --> 17:32.861
I'm saying I want
to go to New York.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.005
You're not thinking
clearly, Mpumi.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.064
I want to
perform, Tumelo.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.349
Why? Why there? Huh?

17:39.433 --> 17:41.870
You can do this here.
Why do you have to go all the way there?

17:41.894 --> 17:46.356
I can't stand it here, Tumelo.
I can't stand it here!

17:47.566 --> 17:51.004
It's all I've known, and this is not good
enough for me anymore, it's just not.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.615
[scoffs] And what
about us, Mpumi? Hmm?

17:54.698 --> 17:57.010
Did you forget that we're married,
Mpumi? What about us?

17:57.034 --> 18:01.354
You can't honestly expect me to be happy
knowing that I gave up my dream.

18:03.540 --> 18:07.753
What about me,
Mpumi? Hmm?

18:15.677 --> 18:16.917
Come with me.

18:20.307 --> 18:23.227
I have to go, Tumelo.
This is my shot.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.316
Tumelo, look.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.193
Look! Look!

18:47.251 --> 18:49.169
[paper tearing]

18:52.381 --> 18:55.217
No. You're
not going there.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.028
I did not pay
all this money

18:57.052 --> 19:00.240
to be blindsided and then dragged
across the world like that.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.344
-Mpumi, you're not going there.
-You paid?

19:05.185 --> 19:06.395
You paid?

19:08.939 --> 19:11.400
[Tumelo] I'm your
husband, Mpumi.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.695
I'm saying no.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.131
You're not going there.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.915
You're not
going anywhere.

This is impossible.

Tumi…

20:22.304 --> 20:23.504
Hey, Phindi.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.379
Hi. Are you with
Mpumi, by any chance?

20:27.184 --> 20:29.465
Nope. I thought
she's at work with you.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.964
[Phindi] Tumi, your wife
is in serious trouble.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.188
It seems that she's
overpaid herself.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.802
Wait, wait. What
are you talking about?

20:44.826 --> 20:46.346
<i>What do you mean,
overpaid herself?</i>

20:46.370 --> 20:50.874
[Phindi] Yes, on the payroll, it says
she gave herself an extra 60,000 rand.

20:51.541 --> 20:52.685
That's theft.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.355
The last girl that did that
is in jail for fraud,

20:55.379 --> 20:58.024

20:58.048 --> 20:59.549

This is mad.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.776
Oh, my God.
Any luck finding her?

21:09.226 --> 21:11.270
Um, not yet. Um…

Please, just give
me one more moment.

than worrying about what I think, girl.

You know?

27:00.118 --> 27:02.162
So anyway, listen to me.

a little and turn downtown.

Oh… no.

doesn't say that.

[Nompumelelo keying]

32:34.243 --> 32:36.138
[man] <i>Nah,
it's, um… to get an audition,</i>

32:36.162 --> 32:39.282
<i>you gotta be a part</i>
<i>of the union to get in.</i>

32:46.130 --> 32:47.715
OK. Um…

32:49.092 --> 32:50.426
OK, thank you.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.070
Where are you headed?

32:52.679 --> 32:53.846
Um…

32:55.181 --> 32:57.181
The subway… the
subway, I guess.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.284
Not too far from here.

32:59.686 --> 33:00.955
I'll get this.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.456
You sure you're
not working?

33:02.480 --> 33:04.680
Nah, my boy inside
will cover for me.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.276
Yes.

33:11.447 --> 33:13.199
I'm Jaquan, by the way.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.760
[Nompumelelo] Seriously?

33:14.784 --> 33:15.785
What?

33:15.868 --> 33:17.471
[Nompumelelo
laughs] Nothing.

33:17.495 --> 33:20.415
Oh, snap. I
see, I see, I see.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.559
And Umfufu is
supposed to be what?

33:22.583 --> 33:24.627
[laughs] Umfufi.

33:24.711 --> 33:27.213
Nah, it's…
Nompumelelo Dube.

33:28.047 --> 33:30.275
I must have heard you say that
a million times this week.

33:30.299 --> 33:31.779
Did I get it right?

33:34.887 --> 33:36.097
Nompumelelo.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.725
Nom-pume-le-lo Du-be.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.411
Can I just call you that?

33:40.435 --> 33:44.248
Ain't nobody from around here
that's gonna say that full name.

33:44.272 --> 33:45.481
Lelo?

33:45.565 --> 33:46.691
Yeah.

33:47.650 --> 33:48.651
What?

33:50.361 --> 33:53.681
It's just my dad used
to call me that, only him.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.218
That's what I'll
call you then.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.286
[car horns blaring]

34:01.122 --> 34:03.583
What's it mean,
your name?

34:04.959 --> 34:06.439
It means "success."

34:06.502 --> 34:09.898
[scoffs] Well, your parents
definitely named you right.

34:09.922 --> 34:12.359
I see you out here
auditioning, never giving up.

34:12.383 --> 34:15.779
It's girls like you
that's gonna make it out here.

34:15.803 --> 34:19.443
Must be some self-fulfilling
prophecy shit or something.

34:19.766 --> 34:20.766
Thanks.

34:34.906 --> 34:38.302
So, must be great growing up,
having that as a name.

34:38.326 --> 34:40.054
[Nompumelelo]
Well, "Jaquan" is, um…

34:40.078 --> 34:41.388
-Yeah?
-…it has a…

34:41.412 --> 34:42.890
-What?
-It's got a French thing.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.394
-Yeah, exactly.
-[laughing]

34:46.417 --> 34:48.562
-[Jaquan sighs]
-Oh, crap.

34:48.586 --> 34:49.629
What?

34:49.712 --> 34:53.049
-I keep forgetting my metro card.
-Hold on.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.736
That's cool.
I probably have one, somewhere.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.071
What will you use?

34:57.095 --> 34:59.448
[Jaquan] I probably got some
in here somewhere, so…

34:59.472 --> 35:00.741
That's cool, keep it.

35:00.765 --> 35:01.885
Thank you.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.313
My bags. My bags.

35:07.396 --> 35:11.567
[scoffs] Yeah, your bags.
My fault, I'm sorry, you know.

35:12.151 --> 35:14.880
Yeah, your bags, of course.
Your bags.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.340
-[laughs]
-All right?

35:16.364 --> 35:18.908
All right, just
trying to run.

35:18.991 --> 35:22.951
Thanks again for everything.
I'll see you at the next auditions.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.407
Thank you.

35:29.001 --> 35:30.169
Hey, Lelo.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.817
Y'all got Facebook
over there in the jungle?

35:34.841 --> 35:36.551
The jungle.

35:36.634 --> 35:40.864
Um, yes, we do need a hamster spinning
around in a wheel to get it, but we do.

35:40.888 --> 35:43.608
-[Jaquan] All right, then.
-Cool.

35:45.601 --> 35:46.936
Hey, Jaquan?

35:47.979 --> 35:50.582
Um… could you rather
just text me instead?

35:50.606 --> 35:53.127
I'm laying low
on social media for a while.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.629
Cos you're some type
of fugitive or something?

35:55.653 --> 35:57.655
Hey, that travel
ban is no joke.

35:58.781 --> 36:01.409
All right then.
What's your number?

36:01.492 --> 36:02.869
Um…

36:09.542 --> 36:11.294
Plaza 2-7…

[woman] Hi, you
must be Nomo…

38:32.018 --> 38:34.371
-[Nompumelelo] Lelo. Jess Feinstein?
-[Jess] Yes.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.291
-[Nompumelelo] Nice to meet you.
-And this is little Gabby.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.035
Say hello to Lelo, Gabby.

38:40.609 --> 38:42.903
I'm sorry, she's
just a little tired.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.214
Please, come in.

38:44.238 --> 38:47.033
Wow. Your
place is gorgeous.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.468
[Jess] Why,
thank you so much.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.804
We just had it redone
to accommodate this little one.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.306
[Nompumelelo]
Wow, how old is she?

38:52.330 --> 38:54.224
Oh, she'll be one
in a few months.

38:54.248 --> 38:55.475
Won't you, baby?

38:55.499 --> 38:57.269
[Nompumelelo]
She is beautiful.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.086
David, she's here.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.439
[David] Just a second.

39:00.463 --> 39:03.066
[softly] Oh, that's what you said
20 minutes ago.

39:03.090 --> 39:06.153
I'm so glad that you could
fill in on such short notice.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.573
Hubby and I have got this thing
happening in the city.

39:09.597 --> 39:12.850
Well, I'm new to the city,
and I really, I…

39:12.933 --> 39:14.202
I need the work, so…

39:14.226 --> 39:16.246
-[baby fussing]
-Oh, I'm so glad.

39:16.270 --> 39:18.481
[making baby talk]

39:18.564 --> 39:22.284
OK, no television while we're away.
No eating of the food.

39:22.318 --> 39:24.779
No leaving before or
after David and me.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.466
David's my husband, who you'll
hopefully meet sometime this year.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.408
David, I'm serious.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.160
You're being rude!

39:31.243 --> 39:35.247
All right, I'm here.
Keep your pants on.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.518
-Hi. David.
-Lelo. Nice to meet you.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.563
Nice… Nice to meet you.
Wow, that's a nice accent.

39:41.587 --> 39:42.731
Where are you from?

39:42.755 --> 39:45.108
-South Africa.
-No kidding?

39:45.132 --> 39:47.426
We were just talking
about going there.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.987
Baby, weren't
we always sayin'…?

39:49.011 --> 39:50.651
Yes, yes, yes, we were.

39:50.679 --> 39:53.116
Uh, no visitors, and no using
of your cell phone

39:53.140 --> 39:54.534
while looking
after the baby.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.203
And you can sleep
in the guest room.

39:56.227 --> 39:59.164
It's $400 a week, but you're gonna
have to buy your own groceries.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.548
-[baby coos]
-Oh, hello.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.836
South Africa, huh?

40:04.860 --> 40:06.612
Where, exactly?

40:06.695 --> 40:08.072
Johannesburg.

40:08.155 --> 40:11.355
I see. That's like
the major city over there.

40:11.742 --> 40:15.514
I can hear from your accent
you went to a good school and all that.

40:15.538 --> 40:18.124
-Thanks.
-David, focus.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.501
Yes, dear.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.920
So, uh, you
have a work visa?

40:24.797 --> 40:26.048
I don't.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.512
But I'm… I'm
extremely hard working.

40:31.595 --> 40:35.035
I'm great with kids.
I'm reliable, I'm trustworthy.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.439
Well, uh…

40:42.356 --> 40:43.756
I like your look.

40:44.191 --> 40:46.026
Let's see how this goes.

40:46.110 --> 40:48.588
Myself and David are gonna
be here for another hour,

40:48.612 --> 40:50.452
so we'll take
it from there?

40:50.531 --> 40:51.675
Great, great.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.118
OK then, well, follow
me to the nursery.

40:56.662 --> 40:58.205
Come on.

Hey.

41:59.934 --> 42:01.310
Wow.

42:01.393 --> 42:02.895
You look beautiful.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.749
-Thank you.
-Like royalty.

42:05.773 --> 42:09.026
Oh, you didn't know?
I'm the queen of Zamunda.

42:09.109 --> 42:11.338
[laughs] <i>Coming
to America.</i>

42:11.362 --> 42:12.905
I love that movie.

"Sex and
chocolate, everybody!"

42:14.823 --> 42:15.842
[laughing]

42:15.866 --> 42:18.244
Sex and chocolate!

42:18.327 --> 42:20.972
Man, Africa is starting to sound
more and more like here

42:20.996 --> 42:22.349
every time I talk to you.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.333
What did you
think it was like?

42:25.417 --> 42:28.577
I don't know.
So, what you trying to do now?

42:28.879 --> 42:30.548
Whatever you like.

42:30.631 --> 42:31.775
[both laugh]

42:31.799 --> 42:32.901
What you wanna eat?

42:32.925 --> 42:35.594
Whatever kind
of food you like.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.038
Hop on two feet.

42:38.472 --> 42:39.533
[Nompumelelo laughs]

42:39.557 --> 42:41.368
-Make a pigeon sound.
-[Nompumelelo coos]

42:41.392 --> 42:43.203
-Whoo!
-[jogger] Oh.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.227
[Jaquan] Watch
it, motherfucker!

42:51.569 --> 42:52.945
Yeah, I'm sorry.

42:54.154 --> 42:55.197
It's OK.

42:55.281 --> 42:56.561
[Jaquan sighs]

42:58.033 --> 42:59.833
Wanna get
something to eat?

43:00.286 --> 43:02.406
Yeah, sure, what
were you thinking?

43:02.454 --> 43:04.891
Um… I mean, you know,
around here we eat burgers and shit,

43:04.915 --> 43:06.768
but if you want
some flies or beetles…

43:06.792 --> 43:08.937
-Ha ha! -…or
insects, I'm pretty sure we can…

43:08.961 --> 43:10.641
[Nompumelelo] Stay cool.

43:11.505 --> 43:13.882
That fame back
home is the dream.

43:13.966 --> 43:16.319
Actually think that's the reason
I'm all the way out here.

43:16.343 --> 43:18.743
[Jaquan] When you
think you're going back?

43:19.388 --> 43:22.708
Till it's me all those people
are paying to see.

43:24.059 --> 43:25.436
[Jaquan] Yes.

43:25.519 --> 43:27.455
[Nompumelelo]
Auditioning is tough,

43:27.479 --> 43:31.692
but actually saying my name
on a legitimate Broadway stage,

43:31.775 --> 43:33.235
that…

43:33.319 --> 43:35.070
that's really the dream.

43:37.281 --> 43:38.521
[Jaquan] Wow.

43:39.158 --> 43:40.659
Must be nice.

43:41.660 --> 43:42.660
What?

43:45.247 --> 43:49.060
Having a name like "success"
and already making it happen for yourself.

43:49.084 --> 43:50.377
I'm jealous.

43:55.341 --> 43:57.101
Why don't you
do the same?

43:58.218 --> 43:59.458
I can't sing.

43:59.511 --> 44:02.389
[both laugh]

44:02.473 --> 44:03.867
Was that the dream?

44:03.891 --> 44:05.142
Nah.

44:05.768 --> 44:07.848
Nah, I was going
to be a director.

44:08.437 --> 44:11.757
I was gonna go to school,
direct plays and shit.

44:12.024 --> 44:13.192
You know?

44:13.275 --> 44:14.795
But I got sent away.

44:17.696 --> 44:18.989
Got sent away?

44:19.073 --> 44:21.241
What's this "sent away"?

44:29.500 --> 44:30.860
What did you do?

44:31.585 --> 44:33.785
What makes you
assume I did anything?

44:36.090 --> 44:38.530
-Sorry, I just, I…
-Don't.

44:48.727 --> 44:49.954
I'm sorry, I…

44:49.978 --> 44:52.106
No, look, I'm sorry.

44:52.189 --> 44:55.067
[sighs] Still a
sore spot, I guess.

45:01.782 --> 45:04.063
Some white lady
thought I attacked her.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.125
Identified me
and everything.

45:11.750 --> 45:15.629
Did… Did she know you
before she identified you? What…?

45:18.424 --> 45:20.664
It was a misunderstanding,
that's all.

45:24.930 --> 45:26.690
The judge
didn't think so.

45:29.977 --> 45:32.377
First-time offense, I
spent time in juvie.

45:34.773 --> 45:36.493
Couldn't get it expunged.

45:40.154 --> 45:42.573
No college would
accept me after that.

45:46.994 --> 45:50.747
So now I direct actors
to the back of the queue

45:50.831 --> 45:53.151
and assholes to the
back of their seats.

46:19.359 --> 46:21.359
You should come
to South Africa.

46:22.529 --> 46:24.849
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

46:25.240 --> 46:29.345
Come on, me with a bunch of wild Africans
singing "Hakuna Matata" all day?

46:29.369 --> 46:30.287
Yeah, I'll pass.

46:30.370 --> 46:34.934
[laughs] Hey, I watch a bunch of Yankees
singing "New York, New York" every day.

46:34.958 --> 46:37.812
Sometimes you just have to go
as far away as possible

46:37.836 --> 46:39.956
to make things
happen for yourself.

46:41.757 --> 46:43.091
Nah…

46:44.384 --> 46:45.385
Africa?

46:48.013 --> 46:52.053
You're not a convicted criminal,
so of course you can go wherever.

46:52.809 --> 46:54.769
But once you're
in that system…

46:56.522 --> 46:58.565
that shit follows
you everywhere.

47:03.737 --> 47:06.007
Besides, what's a guy like me
gonna do in Africa?

47:06.031 --> 47:07.431
That's your home.

47:11.203 --> 47:13.243
Do you feel at
home here, though?

47:17.000 --> 47:18.168
Tonight…

47:19.628 --> 47:20.629
yeah.

48:07.926 --> 48:09.261
Sorry I'm late.

48:09.344 --> 48:13.056
-Look at you.
-Maybe I should turn in.

48:13.140 --> 48:14.576
Wait, I got
you something.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.351
He did what?

48:16.435 --> 48:18.162
I loved it when
I was younger.

48:18.186 --> 48:21.249
It has musicians from your country
and it's amazing.

48:21.273 --> 48:24.526
I saw it today
and thought of you.

48:24.610 --> 48:28.770
No, don't tell me to calm down.
That white bastard tried to rape you.

48:28.864 --> 48:30.584
See, just put it on, and…

48:30.657 --> 48:35.096
-[<i>Graceland</i>album

48:35.120 --> 48:36.180
Nice, huh?

48:36.204 --> 48:37.873
It didn't get that far.

48:37.956 --> 48:39.708
Kind of makes you…

48:39.791 --> 48:41.460
Now, it could have.

48:41.543 --> 48:43.187
[David] Don't you
wanna, you know…

48:43.211 --> 48:46.065
He didn't. I'm OK, all right?
Just leave it, just calm down.

48:46.089 --> 48:48.383
Everybody's watching.

48:52.846 --> 48:54.014
I'm sorry.

48:54.806 --> 48:57.994
I can't tell you how much
that shit pisses me off.

48:58.018 --> 48:59.738
[Nompumelelo] I can tell.

49:00.228 --> 49:02.028
Right, and it
would be him.

49:02.105 --> 49:03.833
It's an Upper
West Side cracker,

49:03.857 --> 49:05.937
all this money,
think he own shit.

49:07.152 --> 49:09.363
You said his wife
was black, right?

49:11.031 --> 49:12.671
Yeah, that makes sense.

49:12.866 --> 49:14.302
[Nompumelelo] How?

49:14.326 --> 49:17.639
[Jaquan] Because this is
literally history right now.

49:17.663 --> 49:19.748
It's slavery
all over again.

49:20.624 --> 49:23.061
He's got this nigga wife
and this African in his home

49:23.085 --> 49:25.313
and he starts thinking
like his granddaddy's granddad

49:25.337 --> 49:27.417
where he can do
whatever he wants.

49:27.756 --> 49:29.466
And you know what?

49:29.549 --> 49:30.717
He can.

49:31.510 --> 49:33.510
Tell me, are you
gonna stop him?

49:33.553 --> 49:36.324
Hell, there's one who thinks
just like him in the White House.

49:36.348 --> 49:38.058
So, what's the point?

49:38.141 --> 49:41.261
You said you wanted to be
African-American?

49:42.104 --> 49:43.730
Well, welcome to it.

49:44.731 --> 49:47.012
This here's our
fucking circle of life.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.090
Can't be that bad.

49:52.114 --> 49:55.134
Nah, you and everybody else
laugh at us all day long,

49:55.158 --> 49:57.845
making fun of our culture,
the way we talk and our name,

49:57.869 --> 50:01.099
but this is what we go through
on the regular.

50:01.123 --> 50:02.803
This is how we got here.

50:03.375 --> 50:05.135
It's the world
we live in.

50:05.460 --> 50:08.398
And even when they put us in charge,
we get shot at or put away

50:08.422 --> 50:11.702
because we still living
on the damn plantation.

50:12.592 --> 50:15.832
Can't tell me we
ain't pickin' cotton no more.

50:16.930 --> 50:18.290
Shit, you lucky.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.489

50:21.810 --> 50:23.353
But the rest of us…

50:29.985 --> 50:31.319
I can't.

50:34.364 --> 50:35.644
[Jaquan] What?

50:38.201 --> 50:39.578
I can't go back.

50:40.787 --> 50:42.627
[Jaquan] Why?
What you mean?

50:43.248 --> 50:45.518
I don't know much about your country,
but I know you guys

50:45.542 --> 50:49.063
don't got like no war or famine
going on or something like that.

50:49.087 --> 50:52.316
And you're always talking about how home
ain't that much different from the city,

50:52.340 --> 50:53.508
right?

50:53.592 --> 50:55.635
You ain't gotta be here.

50:58.346 --> 51:00.223
I burnt all my bridges.

51:01.725 --> 51:04.352
It's not that I
won't go back, I…

51:05.353 --> 51:07.481
I cannot go back.

51:12.444 --> 51:13.964
Wanna talk about it?

51:24.831 --> 51:26.166
Look, Lelo…

51:28.418 --> 51:30.538
I don't know what
brought you here…

51:33.465 --> 51:35.505
and I don't know
why you're here…

51:36.802 --> 51:38.562

that you are.

[Jess] Um… we won't be requiring
your services anymore.

52:27.477 --> 52:31.773
Please pack your belongings
and get outta the house.

52:32.941 --> 52:34.860

52:36.611 --> 52:38.572

know what you did.

52:38.655 --> 52:39.865

52:44.286 --> 52:47.486
[Jess] David said he found this
in your room.

52:52.627 --> 52:54.087
He said that?

52:58.383 --> 53:00.361
Jess, I didn't want to be the one
to tell you this,

53:00.385 --> 53:03.239
but Dave made a pass at me,
and when I rejected him,

53:03.263 --> 53:06.383
he decided to concoct this…
disgusting lie!

53:07.392 --> 53:09.592
Jess, you have to
believe me, please.

53:12.981 --> 53:14.500

53:56.191 --> 53:57.901
I can't go home, Jaq.

53:58.818 --> 54:00.098
I can pay you.

what you two
have in common.

1:10:32.561 --> 1:10:33.561
And…

1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:37.042
I just thought this could be
our clean break

fucked her way to become an American,

to get on Broadway?

OK, I wasn't as honest
as I needed to be,
