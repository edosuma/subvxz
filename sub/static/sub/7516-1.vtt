01:13.876 --> 01:14.959
Fai!

01:21.126 --> 01:22.501
What happened to you?

01:23.042 --> 01:25.042
Send an ambulance over.

01:25.792 --> 01:27.959
What's your name? What happened?

01:29.917 --> 01:31.209
I'm Hahou Mo.

01:38.917 --> 01:40.042
I killed someone.

03:30.334 --> 03:34.084
"Three years later."

04:05.251 --> 04:06.834
Estimated time of death is 2:30 a.m.

04:07.042 --> 04:08.251
Madam is here.

04:19.916 --> 04:21.791
Madam, this is Tarn Sir.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.376
Tarn Fu-wing from Tsimshatsui Crime Unit.

04:25.542 --> 04:27.583
Luk Yuen-sum from HQ. I'm taking over.

04:27.584 --> 04:29.709
I understand. Down this way.

04:30.417 --> 04:31.417
Big Guy!

04:35.084 --> 04:37.792
I told them to check the nearby CCTV,

04:38.001 --> 04:40.334
to find out how the Ferrari crashed.

04:48.417 --> 04:49.750
Anything in the car?

04:49.751 --> 04:51.917
2 packs of drugs in the driver seat.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.001
Where's the body? Not in the car?

04:54.292 --> 04:55.459
In the tunnel.

05:11.792 --> 05:13.192
Is this Glock 17 the murder weapon?

05:13.292 --> 05:15.001
No, it belongs to the deceased.

05:15.501 --> 05:16.584
All rounds have been fired,

05:16.959 --> 05:18.334
but didn't hit anyone.

05:30.459 --> 05:32.626
Estimated time of death is 2:30 a.m.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.417
No sign of the body being moved.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.292
I believe he was killed right here.

05:36.626 --> 05:38.667
He sustained multiple injuries.

05:38.834 --> 05:42.001
Check out the bruises on his left hand,

05:42.334 --> 05:44.542
fractured ribs and sternum

05:44.959 --> 05:47.917
dislocated lower jaw and a skull
with comminuted fracture,

05:48.167 --> 05:49.459
all indicate the impact of a heavy blow.

05:49.709 --> 05:51.292
From the crash?

05:51.501 --> 05:53.125
No, according to Forensics,

05:53.126 --> 05:55.959
the injuries are created by bare hands.

05:56.334 --> 05:57.667
Check out his throat.

05:57.876 --> 05:59.459
There's no apparent open wound,

05:59.626 --> 06:03.292
but his cervial vertebra
and wind pipe have snapped.

06:05.459 --> 06:06.792
By bare hands?

06:30.876 --> 06:32.251
Try to clench your fist.

06:32.542 --> 06:33.751
I can't.

06:34.376 --> 06:35.626
I can't even hold a cup.

06:36.084 --> 06:38.792
The hand trembles when the weather changes.

06:39.251 --> 06:42.625
The wound was bone deep,

06:42.626 --> 06:43.666
you didn't consult a doctor back then,

06:43.667 --> 06:45.000
or else you would have recovered.

06:45.001 --> 06:46.376
I did that on purpose.

06:46.542 --> 06:48.876
I hacked that bastard
30 times before I was hit.

06:49.126 --> 06:50.542
When I look at the scar,

06:50.834 --> 06:53.500
I know I have avenged my daughter.

06:53.501 --> 06:55.084
Yes, you've got a point, OK?

06:59.459 --> 07:00.542
See you later.

07:00.792 --> 07:04.209
Looks who's here!
The asshole who just got arrested.

07:05.751 --> 07:06.626
Move, you old bastard!

07:06.627 --> 07:08.626
Let's go sit over there!

07:08.917 --> 07:09.751
Get lost!

07:09.834 --> 07:13.084
We're leaving... sorry!

07:13.667 --> 07:17.292
Get lost!

07:17.417 --> 07:19.501
We're leaving... sorry!

07:22.126 --> 07:23.584
Read the paper.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.208
Come on.

07:30.209 --> 07:32.251
A bizarre homicide

07:32.417 --> 07:34.177
took place inside the
Salisbury Road tunnel.

07:34.251 --> 07:38.084
A body with multiple injuries was found.

07:38.376 --> 07:40.042
The victim Mak Wing-yan,

07:40.251 --> 07:41.584
a.k.a. Shark Yan,

07:41.792 --> 07:42.992
had multiple criminal records.

07:43.167 --> 07:44.792
The Police found drugs at the scene.

07:44.917 --> 07:47.584
It's possible the murder is drug related.

07:47.792 --> 07:51.167
Chief Inspector Luk Yuen-sum is
in charge of the investigation.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.501
Sir, I need to make a call.

07:57.667 --> 07:58.987
I need to make a call to F0 Shan.

07:59.084 --> 07:59.876
Sure!

07:59.877 --> 08:01.292
- It won't take long. - Fill out the form.

08:01.542 --> 08:02.292
But Sir...

08:02.293 --> 08:04.333
Ask someone to buy you a phone card,

08:04.334 --> 08:05.375
Don't play me, Sir.

08:05.376 --> 08:08.126
Give it to your welfare
officer and get in line.

08:08.292 --> 08:09.666
You can make the call in front
of the welfare officer.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.000
Just one call, Sir.

08:12.001 --> 08:13.709
Everyone says it's urgent.

08:14.001 --> 08:15.251
No matter how urgent,

08:15.376 --> 08:17.876
we must go by the book.

08:18.084 --> 08:21.334
Sir... Please help me out! Do you hear me?

08:36.083 --> 08:38.001
I want to see Madam Luk.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.876
I can help her with the case.

08:41.667 --> 08:42.833
Yes, Sir!

08:44.083 --> 08:46.667
Shall I serve you milk tea and toast?

08:47.709 --> 08:49.501
You think you're still the instructor?

08:49.626 --> 08:51.334
You can see anyone you want?

08:56.834 --> 08:59.001
We'll fix the old man in the shower.

09:17.751 --> 09:19.459
What are you doing? Don't fight!

09:19.667 --> 09:20.791
Don't fight!

09:20.792 --> 09:21.876
Fix him!

09:42.334 --> 09:43.751
Beat him up!

11:00.876 --> 11:05.417
Hands on your head! Get down!

11:11.876 --> 11:13.417
I want to see Luk Yuen-sum!

11:14.959 --> 11:16.584
I want to see Luk Yuen-sum!

11:18.334 --> 11:19.792
He is a model inmate,

11:19.917 --> 11:21.757
and has been on good behavior
the past 3 years.

11:22.209 --> 11:24.042
But yesterday he asked for you

11:25.126 --> 11:26.834
and beat up on other inmates.

11:27.917 --> 11:30.667
This behavior is highly unusual.

11:33.334 --> 11:34.626
How many?

11:36.042 --> 11:37.334
17...

11:37.917 --> 11:38.917
Open up!

11:57.542 --> 11:58.751
Madam,

11:58.792 --> 12:01.084
could you buy me 17 carton of smokes

12:01.251 --> 12:03.292
for those I have injured?

12:03.792 --> 12:05.417
I'll pay you back next time.

12:06.209 --> 12:07.459
Next time?

12:08.292 --> 12:09.542
You'll be back.

12:11.501 --> 12:14.459
I once fought Shark Yan,
the Boxing Champion.

12:15.042 --> 12:16.501
You know who's the killer?

12:16.876 --> 12:18.083
I know what he is.

12:18.084 --> 12:18.792
You know him?

12:18.793 --> 12:19.917
No.

12:20.751 --> 12:22.626
I know what he's thinking.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.251
He'll strike again.

12:25.667 --> 12:26.876
How do you know?

12:27.292 --> 12:28.959
You don't kill someone

12:29.209 --> 12:30.542
in an ordinary duel.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.041
Even when I killed someone by accident,

12:32.042 --> 12:33.292
I didn't run off.

12:33.459 --> 12:35.626
If it's revenge, he should have used a gun.

12:36.834 --> 12:39.084
Killing with bare hands,
he meant to slaughter.

12:41.042 --> 12:42.792
Don't you think he did that on purpose?

12:44.292 --> 12:45.709
I know what he's thinking.

12:47.126 --> 12:48.792
I can help you catch him if

12:48.917 --> 12:50.209
you set me free.

12:50.667 --> 12:53.084
Why do you think I need your help?

12:53.459 --> 12:56.251
Because you know martial arts
and what he's thinking?

13:01.584 --> 13:02.917
Shoulders merge with crotch,

13:03.084 --> 13:04.334
elbows with knees,

13:04.542 --> 13:05.709
hands with feet.

13:05.834 --> 13:07.626
Capturing is rigid, seizing is flexible.

13:07.751 --> 13:09.042
One moves onto weapons

13:09.542 --> 13:10.876
after he masters grappling.

13:11.084 --> 13:13.084
A weapon is the extension of the limbs.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.959
When man and weapon merge,

13:15.959 --> 13:16.917
heart merges with mind,

13:16.918 --> 13:19.158
mind merges with energy,
and energy merges with strength.

13:19.709 --> 13:21.389
Yin on the inside and yang on the outside.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.626
Energy is formed inside out.

13:23.834 --> 13:26.376
You can't move on without first attaining
the previous form.

13:26.626 --> 13:28.066
What the hell are you talking about?

13:28.084 --> 13:30.459
I cracked many cases without
knowing martial arts.

13:30.584 --> 13:32.784
Knowing martials arts doesn't mean
you can solve a case.

13:32.876 --> 13:35.209
Give me another reason.

13:38.334 --> 13:42.542
Tung Ching-ting, Tarn King-yiu, Cho Chi-on,

13:42.792 --> 13:46.334
Yuen Ching-yeung, Fong Man-hei,
Fu Sing-tai, Fong Luk-tak,

13:46.542 --> 13:49.167
one of these seven men
will be the next victim.

13:50.376 --> 13:52.792
Sit down!

14:05.042 --> 14:06.842
Dig up everything you can
about all 8 of them.

14:06.917 --> 14:07.751
8?

14:07.751 --> 14:08.751
Including Hahou Mo.

14:08.876 --> 14:10.126
Yes, Madam!

(CHINESE OPERA)"

14:40.376 --> 14:47.792
"Tam King-yiu"

15:32.751 --> 15:34.084
Over 10 years ago,

15:34.626 --> 15:37.501
a man called Tarn King-yiu

15:38.876 --> 15:41.917
kicked his way to the top in Asia.

15:43.334 --> 15:46.334
He was regarded as the best.

15:49.292 --> 15:50.292
Afterwards,

15:51.167 --> 15:52.792
he retired

15:53.376 --> 15:55.542
and became an artist.

16:01.167 --> 16:04.709
My name is Fung Yu-sau.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.084
I'm here

16:08.126 --> 16:09.709
to fight you

16:10.584 --> 16:11.959
to the death.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.126
Get off!

16:15.292 --> 16:16.584
You can't step on that.

16:22.292 --> 16:23.792
Can we fight now?

16:43.459 --> 16:45.626
You're born with a handicap in your legs,

16:46.376 --> 16:49.042
I'm really impressed

16:49.209 --> 16:51.000
you trained yourself to overcome it.

16:51.001 --> 16:52.333
You're renowned for your kicking,

16:52.334 --> 16:54.501
I wish to challenge you.

17:38.042 --> 17:39.792
Tung Ching-ting, Tam King-yiu,

17:39.959 --> 17:42.459
Fu Sing-tai, Fong Luk-tak are all clean

17:42.626 --> 17:44.167
and have different backgrounds
and professions.

17:44.334 --> 17:45.374
They're ordinary citizens.

17:45.417 --> 17:46.834
Do they know martial arts?

17:47.209 --> 17:48.209
I'll need to check.

17:48.376 --> 17:50.709
Now Hahou Mo is interesting.

17:51.292 --> 17:53.125
He once headed the famous martial arts club

17:53.126 --> 17:54.376
Six Mergence Sect in Fo Shan,

17:55.001 --> 17:58.042
which had thousands
of followers in its heyday.

17:58.209 --> 17:59.375
He was enlisted by the Hong Kong Police

17:59.376 --> 18:00.834
as a martial arts instructor.

18:01.126 --> 18:03.292
He killed someone in a duel

18:03.667 --> 18:04.959
and got a 5-year sentence.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.834
His followers and students dispersed,

18:07.251 --> 18:08.971
while many of the branch schools shut down.

18:09.042 --> 18:11.126
Madam, we have a problem!

18:26.126 --> 18:29.292
We interrupt with a breaking news

18:29.501 --> 18:33.251
of a homicide at the
Arts Expo this morning.

18:33.459 --> 18:35.833
The victim is a contemporary artist,

18:35.834 --> 18:37.416
Tarn King-yiu.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.126
I can help you catch him
if you set me free.

18:41.917 --> 18:43.376
I know what he's thinking.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.084
Give me another reason.

18:49.751 --> 18:52.792
Tung Ching-ting, Tam King-yiu,

18:53.084 --> 18:55.959
one of these seven men
will be the next victim.

18:57.167 --> 18:58.584
You'll be back.

19:06.459 --> 19:07.667
Tarn King-yiu is dead.

19:11.292 --> 19:12.959
He was kicked to death?

19:13.959 --> 19:15.376
Does it matter?

19:17.667 --> 19:20.376
Tarn had awesome leg training
and was kicked to death,

19:20.626 --> 19:23.417
and Mak was an expert boxer
and was beaten to death,

19:23.626 --> 19:24.667
weren't they?

19:25.334 --> 19:28.667
Let me out so I can help you, or

19:29.126 --> 19:31.042
more people will die.

19:54.084 --> 19:55.334
It won't be long now.

19:56.501 --> 19:57.667
Won't be long.

20:04.126 --> 20:07.126
"Conquer The Five Battles

20:13.751 --> 20:19.709
"Wong Chit"

20:40.209 --> 20:40.751
Thanks.

20:40.752 --> 20:41.876
Bye-bye.

20:46.959 --> 20:47.959
Good morning.

20:48.001 --> 20:49.126
Morning.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.542
This is your temporary pass.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.333
From now on,

20:54.334 --> 20:56.376
you're in Police custody.

20:57.042 --> 20:58.417
Inside is a cell phone,

20:58.584 --> 21:00.459
we must be able to reach
you round the clock,

21:00.626 --> 21:03.042
until we close file and we don't need you.

21:03.417 --> 21:04.959
Whether or not you go back to jail

21:05.084 --> 21:06.001
and for how long,

21:06.002 --> 21:07.792
will depend on your behavior.

21:14.251 --> 21:15.626
You're out.

21:16.167 --> 21:18.709
Tell me how you can help me.

21:19.751 --> 21:21.626
According to the sequence of the victims,

21:22.417 --> 21:24.751
the killer seems to be following
a martial arts phrase.

21:25.251 --> 21:27.334
Starting with fists,
then legs and grappling,

21:27.709 --> 21:29.709
weapons and internal energy.

21:30.001 --> 21:31.250
His target is always the expert

21:31.251 --> 21:32.709
in the repsective discipline.

21:33.251 --> 21:35.084
Who's the next target?

21:38.792 --> 21:39.959
Go to Mongkok.

21:41.376 --> 21:43.417
"Tattoo Studio"

21:54.626 --> 21:57.417
We're closed. Come back tomorrow.

22:03.042 --> 22:04.876
We found this at the scene,

22:05.001 --> 22:06.167
what do you make of it?

22:06.834 --> 22:08.001
I don't know.

22:10.459 --> 22:11.876
If your logic is

22:12.251 --> 22:15.709
boxing, kicking then grappling,

22:16.542 --> 22:18.084
is Wong Chit

22:18.292 --> 22:19.959
a" expert grappler?

22:22.834 --> 22:24.126
He was, 3 years ago.

22:39.084 --> 22:40.959
Go up...

22:41.501 --> 22:43.751
Excuse me, step back...

22:45.834 --> 22:47.084
Go up...

22:52.417 --> 22:54.292
His hand is bent out of shape

22:54.459 --> 22:55.459
as if it was smashed by a hammer.

22:55.460 --> 22:57.292
The so-called breaking
the bones and tendons?

23:01.917 --> 23:03.084
Grappling!

23:03.376 --> 23:04.959
If the killer is the same person,

23:05.376 --> 23:06.916
is it possible he's proficient

23:06.917 --> 23:08.459
in boxing, kicking and grappling?

23:08.876 --> 23:10.126
It's not impossible.

23:18.376 --> 23:22.542
I came to fight you to the death.

25:23.126 --> 25:24.667
He won't shut his eyes!

25:25.001 --> 25:26.292
He was my friend.

25:27.001 --> 25:28.501
My friend.

25:49.126 --> 25:50.542
Don't move!

26:04.042 --> 26:06.417
He jumped to the next building,
lock it down!

27:09.584 --> 27:11.084
Police! Open up!

27:13.167 --> 27:15.166
Madam, we searched the nearby buildings.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.584
No sign of Hahou Mo.

27:21.792 --> 27:23.626
I can't take your call right now,

27:23.834 --> 27:25.084
please leave a message.

27:27.626 --> 27:28.751
Sinn Ying,

27:29.709 --> 27:30.959
I'm out.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.459
I'm on my way back to Fo Shan.

27:52.459 --> 27:53.751
See you.

29:19.667 --> 29:22.417
"Six Mergence Sect"

29:37.292 --> 29:38.376
Shifu,

29:39.251 --> 29:40.376
I was wrong.

29:41.126 --> 29:44.751
I thought beating other
sects would bring glory,

29:45.876 --> 29:47.501
but I caused trouble instead,

29:48.917 --> 29:50.542
for killed someone by accident.

29:52.584 --> 29:53.751
I'm so sorry!

30:34.126 --> 30:35.376
I got this for you.

30:35.626 --> 30:36.792
Hopefully the string

30:37.209 --> 30:39.959
can restrain your fists

30:40.417 --> 30:41.834
and help you control yourself.

31:34.334 --> 31:35.417
Where did this come from?

31:37.542 --> 31:40.209
A few months ago, a man came to the school.

31:40.751 --> 31:44.126
He was about 30 and was limping.

31:44.501 --> 31:46.667
He asked me to give this to you.

31:49.709 --> 31:50.876
Is everything alright?

31:53.292 --> 31:55.334
I'm actually working for
the Hong Kong Police.

31:56.084 --> 31:58.834
The case may be related to this thing.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.376
Don't worry!

32:03.792 --> 32:05.167
Are you sure?

32:06.042 --> 32:07.417
Don't worry!

32:08.251 --> 32:10.917
You wanted to see To Fook-ming?

32:11.167 --> 32:13.251
Because of this thing?

32:13.542 --> 32:15.542
I'll take you to him tomorrow morning.

32:18.542 --> 32:19.251
Get some sleep!

32:19.251 --> 32:20.251
Good night.

32:20.459 --> 32:22.501
Good night.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.083
"The same object was"

32:33.084 --> 32:35.334
"found at the scene."

32:35.417 --> 32:36.833
"The Police believe the killer
left it behind for a reason"

32:36.834 --> 32:38.250
"and has released a picture
of the object to the media."

32:38.251 --> 32:39.791
"Anyone who has information of the object"

32:39.792 --> 32:41.352
"should contact the Police right away."

32:53.167 --> 32:54.417
Suet!

32:55.167 --> 32:56.376
It won't be long now.

32:57.626 --> 32:58.876
Won't be long.

34:31.751 --> 34:32.376
Enjoy!

34:32.376 --> 34:33.001
Thank you.

34:33.167 --> 34:34.292
Thank you.

34:36.376 --> 34:38.626
Swallows used to nest
beneath the eaves of the rich

34:39.042 --> 34:41.626
now enter the homes of commoners.

34:43.376 --> 34:46.376
This is called "Eaves Swallow".

34:47.042 --> 34:48.251
In the Qing dynasty,

34:48.626 --> 34:51.501
martial artists used to compete in Beijing.

34:51.917 --> 34:54.166
The losers will each get an Eaves Swallow

34:54.167 --> 34:57.126
from the Ministry of War.

34:57.792 --> 34:59.417
Yours is an imitation,

34:59.751 --> 35:02.417
the real one is made of silver and lead

35:02.584 --> 35:03.876
and should be worth something.

35:04.042 --> 35:05.417
A consolation prize.

35:06.751 --> 35:08.584
This so called conferment

35:08.834 --> 35:10.542
definitely had a different meaning.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.500
It appeared to be a token of

35:12.501 --> 35:14.459
appreciation for their hard work.

35:14.626 --> 35:16.106
But in reality, the message was clear

35:16.376 --> 35:19.751
that martial artists completely useless,

35:19.959 --> 35:23.792
just like a swallow beneath
the eaves of the Qing Emperor.

35:24.334 --> 35:27.084
What's your interest in it?

35:27.292 --> 35:29.834
A serial killer of martial artists

35:29.959 --> 35:31.917
left the Eaves Swallow at the scene.

35:32.126 --> 35:34.417
The killer is a cripple.

35:37.959 --> 35:39.376
Anything else you wish to add?

35:41.292 --> 35:42.542
That's about it.

35:44.459 --> 35:46.042
That's all I know.

35:47.876 --> 35:48.959
Thank you, sir.

35:49.084 --> 35:49.834
Thank you.

35:49.959 --> 35:51.959
We won't impose on you anymore.

35:52.084 --> 35:53.126
Goodbye.

35:53.417 --> 35:54.626
I know him.

35:54.959 --> 35:57.209
6 years ago, this man showed up

35:57.501 --> 35:58.876
to challenge me and we fought.

35:59.459 --> 36:01.126
He beat me in the end

36:01.667 --> 36:04.001
and left behind this Eaves Swallow.

36:04.876 --> 36:08.625
He had an unusual name, it sounded ancient.

36:08.626 --> 36:10.001
It's Fung Yu-sau.

36:10.584 --> 36:12.459
He was born with an atrophied left leg,

36:12.792 --> 36:14.542
his legs are of different lengths

36:14.959 --> 36:17.001
as well as different strengths.

36:17.667 --> 36:20.876
Overcoming the handicap through practice,

36:21.209 --> 36:23.209
his achievement

36:24.126 --> 36:25.792
is rather inconceivable.

36:26.167 --> 36:27.959
Do you know where he is?

36:28.667 --> 36:30.834
He lives with his wife on...

36:31.167 --> 36:32.542
Sui Kwai Lane.

36:38.001 --> 36:39.001
Madam.

36:39.084 --> 36:39.834
Who's this?

36:40.001 --> 36:41.084
Hahou Mo!

36:41.334 --> 36:42.167
Where are you?

36:42.334 --> 36:43.292
You've been classified as a fugitive

36:43.293 --> 36:44.959
and been wanted.

36:46.001 --> 36:47.417
I just had a lead on the killer.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.501
Crossing the border without our
consent is a major breach.

36:54.834 --> 36:57.042
I can revoke his parole any minute.

36:57.292 --> 36:58.834
This is a martial arts business.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.376
You may not be able to close file
without our help.

37:02.126 --> 37:04.042
If we help you apprehend the killer,

37:04.292 --> 37:05.959
does he have to go back to jail?

37:08.209 --> 37:09.689
We'll get to that when we close file.

37:29.501 --> 37:30.709
Thank you.

37:36.376 --> 37:38.709
No sign of the suspect, please come up.

37:39.084 --> 37:40.417
Tai Yue, check with Immigration.

37:40.542 --> 37:41.667
Yes, Madam!

37:48.959 --> 37:50.376
Big Guy, check upstairs.

37:50.626 --> 37:51.751
Yes, Madam!

37:52.709 --> 37:53.959
You two stay here.

37:54.126 --> 37:55.417
Don't touch anything.

38:09.167 --> 38:11.126
We searched the house, no one is here.

38:11.417 --> 38:12.917
The tenant is Shum Suet.

38:13.126 --> 38:14.751
She lived here with Fung Yu-sau,

38:15.084 --> 38:16.584
but they've moved out already.

38:17.542 --> 38:18.542
She's the landlady,

38:18.751 --> 38:20.084
she knows the suspect.

38:21.792 --> 38:23.751
The man's name is Fung Yu-sau.

38:23.959 --> 38:25.334
Shum Suet is his wife.

38:25.542 --> 38:27.584
They're a pair of love birds.

38:27.959 --> 38:30.167
The wife has cancer.

38:31.292 --> 38:33.541
The husband does nothing
but practice martial arts.

38:33.542 --> 38:34.917
Over there.

38:35.334 --> 38:37.751
Attain ultimate emptiness
and absolute tranquility,

38:38.209 --> 38:41.292
I observe all things as they develop

38:41.626 --> 38:44.959
and return to their origin.

38:45.126 --> 38:47.876
It means repose and
a return to their destiny,

38:48.042 --> 38:50.959
which leads eternity, to know eternity
means enlightenment.

39:04.751 --> 39:07.792
One day I watched him on the roof.

39:08.876 --> 39:12.001
He rubbed his face with something white,

39:12.334 --> 39:16.084
until there was blood all over his face.

39:16.834 --> 39:18.501
He must be crazy!

39:19.292 --> 39:23.459
He's practicing. It's an ancient method.

39:23.751 --> 39:26.001
He used coarse grained sea salt

39:26.251 --> 39:29.667
to thicken his skin, so he can
take a longer beating.

40:10.751 --> 40:13.084
He turned his handicap
into an awesome weapon.

40:14.876 --> 40:16.500
Without a care in the world,

40:16.501 --> 40:18.958
alone and without a home,

40:18.959 --> 40:20.639
I can now challenge other martial artists.

40:20.709 --> 40:22.042
That's the motive.

40:22.292 --> 40:24.376
He wants to challenge
other martial artists,

40:27.042 --> 40:28.417
and he wants to be No. 1!

40:29.876 --> 40:31.209
A few months ago,
they said they had to go away

40:31.501 --> 40:33.084
to take care of business in Hong Kong,

40:33.292 --> 40:35.751
and paid me 6 months'
rent before they left.

40:37.167 --> 40:39.417
Madam, we got something.

40:39.917 --> 40:41.626
I checked with Immigration,

40:41.917 --> 40:43.876
they said they remembered Shum Suet

40:44.209 --> 40:46.917
because she sat in the lobby by herself

40:47.084 --> 40:48.459
and they helped push her through.

40:48.709 --> 40:50.251
We checked with Hong Kong Immigration,

40:50.459 --> 40:52.042
their record showed Shum Suet

40:52.917 --> 40:55.292
came to Hong Kong from
Fo Shan 3 months ago.

40:56.001 --> 40:57.334
They have nothing after that.

40:57.917 --> 40:59.709
6 years ago, Fung Yu-sau was committed

40:59.917 --> 41:01.417
to a mental hospital in Fo Shan.

41:01.751 --> 41:03.834
There's no recent record of him
entering Hong Kong.

41:05.376 --> 41:06.959
He's being very careful,

41:07.417 --> 41:09.292
trying not to leave a trace.

41:11.626 --> 41:12.626
I bet

41:12.959 --> 41:14.709
he started planning to kill back then.

41:16.876 --> 41:19.209
"Six Mergence Sect"

41:22.709 --> 41:24.584
I must go back with them.

41:25.292 --> 41:27.626
This is the condition for my early release.

41:29.209 --> 41:30.791
Can you stay in Shandong

41:30.792 --> 41:32.084
with Uncle Chor?

41:34.626 --> 41:35.834
Do as I say.

41:36.751 --> 41:37.709
Listen to me.

41:37.710 --> 41:39.292
You fought with Fung Yu-sau already?

41:39.792 --> 41:42.126
That explains your injury.

41:43.084 --> 41:44.959
A martial artist must guard his underarm,

41:45.042 --> 41:45.876
how can you let him injure you?

41:45.877 --> 41:48.042
I have never asked anything of you,

41:48.292 --> 41:50.834
but before we catch the killer,
you must go to Shandong.

41:54.501 --> 41:55.751
Very well!

42:04.167 --> 42:05.251
But,

42:05.459 --> 42:06.959
if you really care about me,

42:07.292 --> 42:09.501
you should let me stay with you.

42:09.834 --> 42:11.333
Listen to me...

42:11.334 --> 42:13.333
Miss Sinn, on behalf
of the Hong Kong Police,

42:13.334 --> 42:14.876
I wish to solicit your help.

42:15.334 --> 42:16.792
But, Madam...

42:17.292 --> 42:19.583
I'll tell Miss Lee,

42:19.584 --> 42:20.750
so she can find a substitute teacher.

42:20.751 --> 42:24.209
No! You can't do this...

42:24.417 --> 42:27.041
You can't drag her into this mess!

42:27.042 --> 42:28.500
If she comes along,

42:28.501 --> 42:30.126
you can concentrate on the case.

42:31.042 --> 42:35.042
Madam, come back...

42:40.001 --> 42:41.459
You can't bring a weapon.

42:41.959 --> 42:43.251
I need to practice everyday.

42:43.417 --> 42:45.792
This is from my father.

42:45.959 --> 42:47.376
Sorry, Madam,

42:47.667 --> 42:49.876
the sword goes wherever she goes.

42:51.542 --> 42:53.709
Who's the next target?

42:53.917 --> 42:55.542
Weapon comes after grappling.

42:57.084 --> 42:59.167
The most likely target is Chan Pak-kwong.

42:59.334 --> 43:01.292
His saber is fast like lightning.

43:02.667 --> 43:04.792
Madam, we commandeered several units,

43:05.042 --> 43:07.334
and put eyes in the neighboring streets.

43:07.584 --> 43:09.292
Good, be careful!

43:28.042 --> 43:29.792
Mr. Chow, you're not eating in?

43:30.042 --> 43:32.792
No, I'm eating with my wife tonight.

43:43.542 --> 43:46.001
The one holding the shovel
is your weapon master?

43:47.001 --> 43:48.584
Back then, with a rod in his hands,

43:49.292 --> 43:51.542
he beat several dozens
holding watermelon knives.

43:54.792 --> 43:55.876
Master Chan!

43:56.292 --> 43:58.542
Try my cooking, Miss Sinn!

43:58.792 --> 43:59.459
Come on, Mo!

43:59.460 --> 44:01.042
Long time no see!

44:02.167 --> 44:05.000
This is my friend Miss Luk.

44:05.001 --> 44:08.292
Please sit down! Try my cooking!

44:08.542 --> 44:09.459
How long ago

44:09.460 --> 44:13.001
did you beat me?

44:13.626 --> 44:15.167
It was pure luck!

44:15.459 --> 44:18.001
I haven't practiced in 3 years.

44:19.292 --> 44:22.459
I can't practice even if I wanted to. Look!

44:24.167 --> 44:25.959
What happened?

44:26.209 --> 44:28.250
I was in a car crash 2 years ago.

44:28.251 --> 44:30.376
It's nothing but nuts and bolts inside.

44:32.084 --> 44:33.125
What about your school?

44:33.126 --> 44:36.416
Remember you first challenged my protege

44:36.417 --> 44:38.209
and came to me after you beat him?

44:38.584 --> 44:40.166
I'm putting him in charge of the school.

44:40.167 --> 44:41.042
I seldom go back now.

44:41.043 --> 44:42.667
The action star Hung Yip?

44:44.209 --> 44:45.417
Now the next shot...

44:45.626 --> 44:47.167
the camera will stay on the bike,

44:47.417 --> 44:49.834
when it lands,

44:50.417 --> 44:52.917
the warriors on the left will
run towards Hung Yip.

44:53.126 --> 44:53.917
Understand?

44:53.917 --> 44:54.667
I understand.

44:54.667 --> 44:55.584
Are you clear?

44:55.584 --> 44:56.501
I'm clear.

44:56.584 --> 44:58.084
Ready... go!

45:03.167 --> 45:05.667
Who let the bike down?
Who let go of the wire?

45:12.959 --> 45:13.626
Who the hell is he?

45:13.627 --> 45:15.542
Who the hell is he? Get rid of him!

45:16.626 --> 45:19.709
Hey, you! Get out!

45:34.084 --> 45:35.584
This is not your fight!

45:36.542 --> 45:37.876
Leave!

45:43.001 --> 45:44.459
Let's go!

45:47.209 --> 45:49.251
For a true expert

45:49.542 --> 45:52.876
still water runs deep.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.459
You're a weapon master,

45:55.709 --> 45:57.376
but reduced to being a stuntman.

45:58.417 --> 45:59.751
Who would have guessed

46:00.167 --> 46:03.251
your craft is not an act?

46:05.542 --> 46:07.334
I'm here to challenge you.

48:38.959 --> 48:40.709
According to the autopsy,

48:41.209 --> 48:43.209
the deceased sustained 14 wounds.

48:44.084 --> 48:46.792
The cause of death is a severed
aorta by something sharp,

48:47.417 --> 48:50.084
leaving a wound 16 cm. long.

49:04.667 --> 49:05.751
Madam,

49:06.917 --> 49:09.792
we only found Hung Yip's
prints on the sword.

49:10.584 --> 49:12.750
We found a scrap of cloth on the sword

49:12.751 --> 49:14.501
that contains a small amount of blood.

49:15.542 --> 49:17.751
Crosscheck the DNA samples on file,

49:18.001 --> 49:19.376
see if we'll find anything.

49:19.542 --> 49:20.834
Yes, Madam!

49:25.084 --> 49:29.376
Boxing, kicking, grappling and then weapon.

49:29.626 --> 49:31.026
If you move from outside to inside,

49:31.126 --> 49:33.792
what is inside?

49:34.209 --> 49:35.584
Who's next?

49:35.792 --> 49:38.001
Why is he so determined to kill them all?

49:38.459 --> 49:40.625
No one in this day and age would do it,

49:40.626 --> 49:41.959
unless he's a maniac.

49:43.084 --> 49:44.126
A martial arts maniac.

49:44.292 --> 49:45.416
Is that why you killed your opponent?

49:45.417 --> 49:46.792
That's why I'm in jail.

49:47.667 --> 49:50.917
One must pay for one's mistake.
I'm still paying...

50:07.751 --> 50:08.917
This is Lee Yeung-chung.

50:09.084 --> 50:11.417
The last 3 homicides hit the front page.

50:11.626 --> 50:12.626
I could understand that.

50:13.001 --> 50:15.042
Last night's case

50:15.334 --> 50:16.959
became a showbiz headline!

50:17.667 --> 50:20.001
How much time do you
still need to wrap this up?

50:20.959 --> 50:23.834
Sir, I have a very important lead...

50:24.292 --> 50:25.750
Leads are useless.

50:25.751 --> 50:27.292
I want to close file!

50:27.834 --> 50:28.875
Just like in a soccer game,

50:28.876 --> 50:30.251
passing the ball
without shooting for the goal

50:30.459 --> 50:31.667
will never win the game.

50:32.042 --> 50:33.792
I want to know when you can crack the case.

50:35.334 --> 50:37.001
Give me 72 hours.

50:38.417 --> 50:39.666
Fine! 3 days later,

50:39.667 --> 50:42.876
you better make the headlines.

50:51.376 --> 50:52.542
Sorry!

50:53.876 --> 50:55.542
I didn't expect Hung Yip would die.

50:56.917 --> 50:58.501
I've been in jail for 3 years,

50:59.292 --> 51:00.876
so much has changed in the meantime.

51:02.876 --> 51:04.376
If we still come up empty handed,

51:05.042 --> 51:06.542
I'll be tranferred.

51:07.167 --> 51:08.334
And...

51:09.042 --> 51:10.417
you'll go straight back to jail.

51:13.042 --> 51:14.626
Hopefully, with what we have on hand,

51:15.001 --> 51:17.126
we can catch Fung Yu-sau
before he strikes again.

51:18.209 --> 51:20.334
If the blood on the sword

51:21.292 --> 51:22.375
belongs to Fung Yu-sau,

51:22.376 --> 51:23.834
that means he's wounded.

51:24.126 --> 51:26.209
He'll probably lay low for a while.

51:26.376 --> 51:27.458
I need time to find out

51:27.459 --> 51:28.292
in martial arts circles

51:28.293 --> 51:30.209
who would be the next target.

51:45.459 --> 51:49.584
Hope you'll be out soon
to take on the challenge

51:59.667 --> 52:01.626
Lam Sir, this way...

52:03.751 --> 52:05.083
ls Hahou Mo on parole?

52:05.084 --> 52:06.208
What is his connection to the case?

52:06.209 --> 52:07.416
What do you want with him?

52:07.417 --> 52:08.917
Why can't the Police solve the case?

52:09.084 --> 52:11.876
We already have a few leads

52:12.209 --> 52:13.959
and have zeroed in on a suspect.

52:14.626 --> 52:16.625
Once we have something more solid,

52:16.626 --> 52:18.000
we will release it to the media.

52:18.001 --> 52:20.041
Lam Sir, the Police said

52:20.042 --> 52:21.958
the killer is after martial artists,

52:21.959 --> 52:23.500
I'm a beginner in judo,

52:23.501 --> 52:25.917
am I in any danger?

52:27.126 --> 52:28.459
Yes or no?

52:28.626 --> 52:30.167
Please say a few words...

52:30.334 --> 52:34.709
Come back, Lam Sir!

52:36.876 --> 52:38.584
Long time no see, Sir!

52:48.376 --> 52:50.625
The metal scraps we found

52:50.626 --> 52:51.959
<i>in Fung Yu-sau's house in Fo Shan</i>

52:52.126 --> 52:54.000
is the same material

52:54.001 --> 52:56.167
as the Eaves Swallows.

52:56.501 --> 52:57.209
Madam,

52:57.210 --> 52:58.583
we found sea salt

52:58.584 --> 53:00.264
on the scrap of cloth on Hung Yip's sword.

53:00.542 --> 53:01.666
Check the degree of pollution

53:01.667 --> 53:03.166
and cross match it with water
quality of different areas.

53:03.167 --> 53:04.459
Yes, Madam!

53:09.376 --> 53:10.542
This is Fung Yu-sau,

53:10.792 --> 53:12.001
let me speak to Hahou Mo.

53:12.709 --> 53:14.334
He said he's Fung Yu-sau,

53:14.542 --> 53:15.876
he's asking for Hahou Mo.

53:20.959 --> 53:21.792
Call SDU.

53:21.793 --> 53:22.834
Yes, Madam!

53:27.501 --> 53:29.084
Stall him!

53:35.292 --> 53:36.667
This is Hahou Mo.

53:37.292 --> 53:40.667
You should thank me for getting you out.

53:42.584 --> 53:44.167
You should know better.

53:45.209 --> 53:46.751
Boxing, kicking,

53:47.292 --> 53:48.792
grappling and then weapon.

53:49.667 --> 53:52.376
From outside to inside, the Mergence.

53:53.626 --> 53:55.459
No jail can keep you

53:55.834 --> 53:57.584
if you wanted to come out.

53:58.834 --> 54:00.542
Madam, we found him!

54:00.792 --> 54:03.126
"Tsim Sha Tsui"

54:03.501 --> 54:04.709
Action!

54:05.126 --> 54:06.251
SDU action!

54:06.376 --> 54:08.167
That day on the roof,

54:08.709 --> 54:10.167
I was disappointed with you.

54:11.042 --> 54:13.042
When we finally meet,

54:13.542 --> 54:14.751
lexpect

54:14.959 --> 54:17.001
to see you in top form.

54:18.709 --> 54:20.542
Perhaps I can help you.

54:21.126 --> 54:22.292
If

54:23.251 --> 54:25.001
Your dearly beloved is dead,

54:26.376 --> 54:27.709
I guarantee

54:28.959 --> 54:30.667
you can kill anyone.

54:30.959 --> 54:32.584
You'll be the first, asshole!

54:33.501 --> 54:35.042
I already told you

54:35.709 --> 54:38.001
the only way to stop me is

54:38.584 --> 54:40.167
to kill me.

55:07.292 --> 55:09.166
Madam, SDU at the scene, over!

55:09.167 --> 55:10.501
Up there! Hurry!

55:11.084 --> 55:12.084
"Sauna"

55:27.792 --> 55:28.959
The suspect got away!

55:29.292 --> 55:30.792
Fung Yu-sau got away again!

55:37.876 --> 55:39.167
He knows you're in jail,

55:39.334 --> 55:40.959
he knows about Sinn Ying,

55:41.126 --> 55:42.606
and plans to use her to threaten you.

55:42.834 --> 55:44.167
He knows you very well.

55:47.167 --> 55:48.167
Wait...

55:48.459 --> 55:49.916
He sets out to kill martial artists,

55:49.917 --> 55:51.376
I'm not surprised he knows me.

55:52.084 --> 55:53.584
Are you suspecting me?

55:57.292 --> 55:58.501
Madam, I'm very tired,

55:58.792 --> 56:00.501
can I see Sinn Ying?

56:03.334 --> 56:04.916
Big Guy, take him away!

56:04.917 --> 56:05.459
Yes, Madam!

56:05.460 --> 56:06.751
Thank you, Madam!

56:16.917 --> 56:19.250
Tai Yue, dig up Hahou Mo's phone records,

56:19.251 --> 56:21.541
visitors and correspondence
for the last 3 years.

56:21.542 --> 56:22.583
I want them now!

56:22.584 --> 56:23.584
Yes, Madam!

56:26.001 --> 56:27.876
If your dearly beloved is dead,

56:28.542 --> 56:31.667
I guarantee you can kill anyone.

56:32.126 --> 56:34.042
You'll be the first, asshole!

56:36.167 --> 56:37.709
I already told you

56:38.001 --> 56:40.126
the only way to stop me is

56:40.667 --> 56:42.209
to kill me.

56:48.917 --> 56:50.501
Madam, it's me.

56:50.709 --> 56:52.042
I was at the prison,

56:52.084 --> 56:54.042
they only keep the surveillance
tape for a month.

56:54.292 --> 56:55.959
Apply for access to HQ's supercomputer

56:56.167 --> 56:58.959
retrieve all the deleted files
from the last 3 years.

57:38.417 --> 57:41.126
Watch the news on TV tomorrow

57:41.376 --> 57:43.917
Last night, a bizarre
homicide took place...

57:44.084 --> 57:45.792
A body was found

57:45.959 --> 57:47.459
with multiple injuries.

57:47.584 --> 57:49.584
The victim is Mak Wing-yan...

57:58.876 --> 57:59.792
Sorry, Madam!

57:59.793 --> 58:00.834
Let's begin!

58:01.126 --> 58:02.500
The phone we found in the sauna

58:02.501 --> 58:04.041
contains an unregistered SIM.

58:04.042 --> 58:06.417
Just like with the Eaves Swallows,

58:06.667 --> 58:08.347
we only found partial prints on the phone.

58:08.459 --> 58:10.501
As for the scrap of cloth,

58:10.751 --> 58:12.083
Tai O's water quality

58:12.084 --> 58:14.292
matched the sea salt on the scrap.

58:14.584 --> 58:17.250
We checked Fung Yu-sau's
picture with Database,

58:17.251 --> 58:18.167
and finally found something.

58:18.292 --> 58:19.834
His real name is Yung Hoi-sang.

58:20.001 --> 58:22.542
He came to Hong Kong
from Hebei at the age of 16.

58:22.709 --> 58:25.458
Tai Fai, debrief other departments
after the meeting.

58:25.459 --> 58:26.584
Yes, Madam!

58:26.834 --> 58:29.042
Over the past 20 years,

58:29.251 --> 58:30.971
he has been coming in and out of Hong Kong,

58:31.167 --> 58:33.542
but stayed mainly in China.

58:34.126 --> 58:35.542
From his inheritance record,

58:35.917 --> 58:38.001
his grandmother had a house in Tai O.

58:38.292 --> 58:41.001
The sea salt we found matched the area.

58:41.167 --> 58:42.666
We believe

58:42.667 --> 58:44.042
that's where he's hiding.

58:44.501 --> 58:45.833
I repeat...

58:45.834 --> 58:47.626
Fung Yu-sau has not yet been convicted,

58:47.792 --> 58:48.876
he's only a suspect.

58:49.001 --> 58:50.667
Our job is to arrest him,

58:50.876 --> 58:53.166
unless he attacks a police or injures
innocent bystander,

58:53.167 --> 58:54.876
otherwise, do not open fire!

59:12.751 --> 59:14.709
SDU standby outside!

59:19.084 --> 59:19.792
Let's get to work!

59:19.793 --> 59:20.917
Yes, Madam!

59:45.834 --> 59:47.167
Shum Suet's memorial tablet.

59:47.459 --> 59:49.376
Madam, the memorial tablet.

59:51.042 --> 59:52.376
The flowers look fresh.

59:59.751 --> 01:00:03.417
Born October 18, 1987.

01:00:03.626 --> 01:00:06.334
Died September 25, 2014.

01:00:06.542 --> 01:00:07.917
She died recently.

01:00:11.834 --> 01:00:13.084
Big guy,

01:00:13.959 --> 01:00:15.084
Put that down!

01:00:17.626 --> 01:00:20.417
Tell everyone to put everything back.

01:00:20.626 --> 01:00:21.917
Yes, Madam!

01:00:25.084 --> 01:00:26.333
Shum Suet's ashes are still here,

01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:27.614
target may come back any minute.

01:00:27.626 --> 01:00:29.167
We must redeploy.

01:00:53.292 --> 01:00:54.972
Based on Shum Suet's personal particulars,

01:00:55.167 --> 01:00:56.727
the day after tomorrow is her birthday.

01:00:56.792 --> 01:00:58.667
Fung Yu-sau is bound to come back then.

01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:02.626
Seal off a 1 km-radius area from
Fung Yu-sau's house.

01:01:02.751 --> 01:01:04.511
CIB will standby outside
the designated area.

01:01:04.667 --> 01:01:05.501
Yes, Madam!

01:01:05.502 --> 01:01:07.667
The Water Team will guard the 3 channels.

01:01:07.876 --> 01:01:08.626
Yes, Madam!

01:01:08.627 --> 01:01:11.917
Tai Yue and the Hit Team will split
into 4 teams of 3,

01:01:12.126 --> 01:01:13.959
move in when Fung Yu-sau sets foot
inside the house.

01:01:14.126 --> 01:01:15.001
Yes, Madam!

01:01:15.002 --> 01:01:17.876
The area branches out into many paths

01:01:18.001 --> 01:01:19.292
and close to civilan dwellings.

01:01:19.501 --> 01:01:21.209
We mustn't let him get away.

01:01:21.459 --> 01:01:22.459
You all should notice,

01:01:22.667 --> 01:01:25.542
Fung Yu-sau is a highly dangerous
murder suspect.

01:01:33.626 --> 01:01:34.501
Thank you!

01:01:34.626 --> 01:01:36.334
I'll tie it for you.

01:01:36.667 --> 01:01:37.917
I can manage.

01:01:40.667 --> 01:01:41.667
Alright, you do it.

01:01:41.876 --> 01:01:44.917
You're always taking on everything.

01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:51.251
The day you become famous,

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:53.667
was the day you become alone in your world.

01:01:59.126 --> 01:02:00.542
Let's eat.

01:02:05.376 --> 01:02:07.417
You think Fung Yu-sau is your match?

01:02:13.584 --> 01:02:15.292
What are you trying to say?

01:02:18.084 --> 01:02:19.584
This is my business,

01:02:20.251 --> 01:02:21.459
not yours.

01:02:22.209 --> 01:02:23.542
This is Police business,

01:02:23.751 --> 01:02:25.251
not yours.

01:04:05.334 --> 01:04:07.084
Target entering Zone C.

01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:46.292
Target is gone.

01:04:46.876 --> 01:04:47.792
Fung Yu-sau is gone.

01:04:47.793 --> 01:04:49.792
Tai Yue, lead the Hit Team in a search.

01:04:53.584 --> 01:04:54.834
Look again!

01:04:57.126 --> 01:04:58.167
Hurry!

01:05:09.501 --> 01:05:11.042
Lam Sir, take a look at this.

01:05:18.501 --> 01:05:20.042
Madam, a call for you.

01:05:22.417 --> 01:05:23.709
Arrest Hahou Mo at once.

01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:25.292
You were right.

01:05:25.459 --> 01:05:27.042
He saw Fung Yu-sau before.

01:05:27.209 --> 01:05:28.417
It's possible they're in on this together,

01:05:28.584 --> 01:05:31.251
aiming to break Hahou Mo out of jail.

01:05:31.542 --> 01:05:32.959
I'll send the information to your laptop.

01:05:33.126 --> 01:05:34.167
Thank you.

01:05:54.126 --> 01:05:56.042
Get up! Hands on your head!

01:05:57.126 --> 01:05:58.959
You're working with Fung Yu-sau!

01:05:59.084 --> 01:06:00.542
Look, Madam! It's Sinn Ying!

01:06:07.417 --> 01:06:09.292
Don't move, put down the gun!

01:06:20.959 --> 01:06:22.084
I'll do it!

01:06:28.792 --> 01:06:30.001
Freeze!

01:06:31.876 --> 01:06:33.126
Freeze!

01:06:46.292 --> 01:06:47.417
Freeze!

01:06:53.084 --> 01:06:54.792
Tai Fai, arrest Hahou Mo at once!

01:06:55.501 --> 01:06:56.459
Listen up!

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:58.292
He's likely to be an accomplice
and highly dangerous.

01:06:58.459 --> 01:07:00.626
Shoot him if he resists.

01:07:41.376 --> 01:07:42.917
I have her ashes,

01:07:43.376 --> 01:07:45.667
leave Hahou Mo alone!

01:07:50.417 --> 01:07:51.667
He'll only become stronger

01:07:52.376 --> 01:07:54.376
when you're dead!

01:08:12.542 --> 01:08:13.501
Hahou Mo got away!

01:08:13.502 --> 01:08:15.292
Officers down! Send backup!

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:46.834
Are you alright?

01:08:47.376 --> 01:08:48.542
Stand up!

01:09:03.626 --> 01:09:06.292
Yours is fancy boxing,

01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:08.292
real martial arts is

01:09:08.876 --> 01:09:10.792
for killing.

01:09:42.584 --> 01:09:44.292
You'll be alright...

01:09:45.501 --> 01:09:47.334
Madam, this is Tai Yue.

01:09:47.501 --> 01:09:49.001
We can't find Hahou Mo in Zone B.

01:09:51.501 --> 01:09:52.667
Freeze!

01:10:01.834 --> 01:10:03.501
What's your situation?

01:10:05.417 --> 01:10:07.751
We need backup!

01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:11.084
Calling control, officers down in Zone A.

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:15.334
Hello? Someone is hurt!

01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:19.001
- Fung Yu-sau's house!
- Send an ambulance.

01:10:19.167 --> 01:10:20.001
I can't hear you, please repeat that!

01:10:20.002 --> 01:10:22.209
Fung Yu-sau's house!

01:10:22.542 --> 01:10:24.584
Teams A, B & C, do you copy?

01:10:25.001 --> 01:10:26.209
Snipers, do you copy?

01:10:26.334 --> 01:10:27.666
Do you copy?

01:10:27.667 --> 01:10:29.084
Let's go over there now!

01:10:45.417 --> 01:10:47.834
Don't go!

01:11:19.376 --> 01:11:21.042
We're on our way over!

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:03.126
Officers in the water,

01:12:05.126 --> 01:12:07.042
we need the Lantau Marine Police.

01:12:07.126 --> 01:12:08.334
Come on!

01:12:16.834 --> 01:12:19.001
Intercept him before he leaves
the typhoon shelter.

01:13:21.542 --> 01:13:23.376
I'm not his accomplice.

01:13:24.209 --> 01:13:25.917
I can explain everything.

01:13:26.834 --> 01:13:28.291
I admit he came to see me in jail.

01:13:28.292 --> 01:13:29.084
Madam.

01:13:29.251 --> 01:13:30.375
He said he worshiped me

01:13:30.376 --> 01:13:31.736
and wanted to follow my footsteps.

01:13:32.001 --> 01:13:34.251
He wanted to beat those I have beaten,

01:13:34.876 --> 01:13:37.376
and then come to challenge
me and be the NO.1.

01:13:37.876 --> 01:13:40.876
Hahou Mo,

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:44.042
you're regarded as the No.1 martial artist.

01:13:44.917 --> 01:13:47.542
We'll fight to the death.

01:13:47.834 --> 01:13:49.126
This is the whole thing goes.

01:13:49.376 --> 01:13:51.876
Why didn't you tell me about
this from the start?

01:13:52.584 --> 01:13:54.084
I admit I have a personal agenda.

01:13:54.667 --> 01:13:56.083
If I told you

01:13:56.084 --> 01:13:57.584
I have met him before,

01:13:58.292 --> 01:13:59.584
then you won't need me

01:14:00.084 --> 01:14:01.292
and get me out.

01:14:01.417 --> 01:14:03.251
I won't have a chance to protect Sinn Ying.

01:14:03.417 --> 01:14:04.751
He threatened me with Sinn Ying.

01:14:05.459 --> 01:14:07.584
Sinn Ying is in Fo Shan.

01:14:08.459 --> 01:14:10.126
If you won't fight me,

01:14:10.584 --> 01:14:11.709
I'll kill her.

01:14:13.626 --> 01:14:16.001
You wanted to fight him from the start.

01:14:18.876 --> 01:14:19.876
Listen to me!

01:14:20.001 --> 01:14:21.833
I did this all for Sinn Ying.

01:14:21.834 --> 01:14:23.709
I thought if I helped
you catch Fung Yu-sau,

01:14:23.917 --> 01:14:25.709
Sinn Ying would be safe.

01:14:26.584 --> 01:14:28.083
But Fung Yu-sau killed so many people,

01:14:28.084 --> 01:14:29.644
She was in danger and I can do nothing.

01:14:30.542 --> 01:14:32.302
Sinn Ying is the most
important thing to me.

01:14:32.626 --> 01:14:34.209
She is the most important thing to me.

01:14:34.459 --> 01:14:41.042
Hahou Mo!

01:14:48.626 --> 01:14:49.792
Come over here.

01:14:51.542 --> 01:14:52.626
Lam Sir!

01:14:55.334 --> 01:14:57.292
I really think you need time off.

01:14:59.209 --> 01:15:00.959
You're taking over?

01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:03.876
The brass thinks

01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:06.334
I've been negligent too,

01:15:06.959 --> 01:15:08.584
though I'm not directly in charge.

01:15:09.626 --> 01:15:12.167
They're shipping me off to
an anti-terrorist drill.

01:15:12.334 --> 01:15:14.251
I'm taking the night train to Guangzhou.

01:15:15.834 --> 01:15:17.500
We're both off the case?

01:15:17.501 --> 01:15:19.292
It'll slow down our progress.

01:15:21.042 --> 01:15:22.584
Everyone stays on

01:15:22.834 --> 01:15:24.501
except you and me.

01:15:28.501 --> 01:15:29.626
Madam.

01:15:33.959 --> 01:15:35.667
Lock down Lantau Island

01:15:35.917 --> 01:15:37.167
and send choppers to conduct a search.

01:15:37.334 --> 01:15:38.959
Call Lantau Police for backup.

01:15:39.084 --> 01:15:40.334
The suspects are still on the island,

01:15:40.459 --> 01:15:42.001
we must find them ASAP.

01:15:42.209 --> 01:15:45.251
Lam Sir, can your team back us up?

01:15:45.501 --> 01:15:46.292
No problem!

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:47.292
Thank you! Get to work!

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:48.542
Yes, Sir!

01:16:23.459 --> 01:16:24.876
I know you know him.

01:16:25.042 --> 01:16:26.709
Why didn't you tell me?

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:30.682
He was really obsessed with martial arts.

01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:33.542
He kept writing me and asked me questions.

01:16:38.917 --> 01:16:40.117
I didn't know he's a murderer.

01:16:40.501 --> 01:16:41.501
I can't believe

01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:44.084
I helped a killer.

01:16:48.209 --> 01:16:49.459
It's not your fault.

01:16:49.667 --> 01:16:51.584
You are right to work with the Police.

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:54.209
Don't blame yourself.

01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:08.084
I don't know,

01:17:08.584 --> 01:17:10.376
I think I need do something to compensate.

01:17:12.292 --> 01:17:13.626
You promised me

01:17:13.917 --> 01:17:15.667
you'll restrain your fists.

01:17:20.251 --> 01:17:21.292
Do it for me!

01:17:21.626 --> 01:17:22.959
Don't fight him.

01:17:29.126 --> 01:17:30.917
Martial arts is meant to kill,

01:17:32.834 --> 01:17:34.459
not a kid's brawl.

01:17:35.501 --> 01:17:37.209
We must decide who lives and who dies.

01:17:41.667 --> 01:17:43.209
<i>Fung Yu-sau was fight.</i>

01:17:44.167 --> 01:17:46.292
Martial arts is meant to kill.

01:17:47.792 --> 01:17:50.084
I should have killed him
the minute I got out.

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:54.292
Then he couldn't have hurt Sinn Ying.

01:18:49.209 --> 01:18:50.709
Boxing, kicking,

01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:52.917
grappling then weapon.

01:18:53.126 --> 01:18:55.584
From the outside to the inside...

01:18:59.626 --> 01:19:03.709
Boxing, kicking, grappling then weapon.

01:19:03.959 --> 01:19:05.279
From the outside to the inside...

01:19:05.501 --> 01:19:08.001
What's inside?

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:10.709
Who's next?

01:19:19.084 --> 01:19:22.709
"Hung Yip, Wong Chit,
Tam King-yiu, Mak Wing-yam..."

01:19:24.001 --> 01:19:25.251
Siu Hok-nin?

01:19:40.667 --> 01:19:42.376
"Siu Hok-nin, car plate GB6729"

01:20:12.792 --> 01:20:14.292
The fact that you didn't run me over,

01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:17.334
means you're ready

01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:18.834
to take me on.

01:20:19.126 --> 01:20:20.917
Running you over is too easy for you.

01:20:23.792 --> 01:20:25.334
I'm here to kill you.

01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:26.751
Good!

01:20:28.959 --> 01:20:30.667
We fight

01:20:31.917 --> 01:20:33.501
to the death!

01:20:45.001 --> 01:20:46.584
Madam Luk Yuen-sum?

01:20:47.417 --> 01:20:48.376
Speaking.

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:49.501
I'm Siu Hok-nin,

01:20:49.959 --> 01:20:51.542
Hahou Mo asked me to call you.

01:21:41.084 --> 01:21:42.084
This is fun!

01:23:29.501 --> 01:23:31.042
We're not finished!

01:24:01.626 --> 01:24:02.959
"Superintendent Chan"

01:24:05.042 --> 01:24:06.042
Rewind it,

01:24:06.167 --> 01:24:07.709
let me hear what he said.

01:24:09.126 --> 01:24:10.334
Right here...

01:27:17.001 --> 01:27:18.709
This is the Hahou Mo

01:27:18.834 --> 01:27:21.876
I've been waiting for.

01:27:24.042 --> 01:27:25.292
Come on!

01:27:25.917 --> 01:27:28.084
Kill me and you'll win.

01:27:41.626 --> 01:27:42.751
Come on!

01:27:47.042 --> 01:27:49.292
Hopefully the string

01:27:50.084 --> 01:27:51.626
can restrain your fists.

01:27:54.126 --> 01:27:55.542
No!

01:29:12.167 --> 01:29:13.626
Hahou Mo,

01:29:15.167 --> 01:29:17.667
you didn't let me down after all.

01:29:21.667 --> 01:29:23.792
You're by far

01:29:24.751 --> 01:29:26.209
the strongest of my opponents.

01:29:28.167 --> 01:29:29.167
But

01:29:30.542 --> 01:29:32.792
martial arts is...

01:29:34.876 --> 01:29:37.959
meant to kill.

01:29:38.834 --> 01:29:40.584
I'll kill you

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:43.042
even if you wouldn't kill me.

01:30:09.459 --> 01:30:11.708
Hahou Mo, can you hear me?

01:30:11.709 --> 01:30:14.001
Hang in there, the ambulance is on its way.

01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:16.501
Hahou Mo, don't close your eyes.

01:30:17.834 --> 01:30:20.459
I'm No. 1.

01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:26.791
<i>Fung Yu-sau,</i>

01:30:26.792 --> 01:30:29.417
put your hands on your head.

01:30:34.167 --> 01:30:36.084
Or I'll shoot.

01:31:01.626 --> 01:31:04.251
Hahou Mo...

01:31:43.292 --> 01:31:45.792
"3 months later"

01:31:52.167 --> 01:31:54.459
Hahou Mou, you have visitors.

01:31:56.792 --> 01:31:59.291
Hey, what about my left arm?

01:31:59.292 --> 01:32:01.334
I'll fix it when I come back.

01:32:19.251 --> 01:32:20.542
Sit down.

01:32:24.334 --> 01:32:26.626
Thanks for looking after Sinn Ying.

01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:29.417
I've kicked off the judicial procedure,

01:32:29.584 --> 01:32:31.084
for the Police to review your case.

01:32:31.251 --> 01:32:32.792
You should get out soon.

01:32:33.084 --> 01:32:34.583
I hope you'll come back

01:32:34.584 --> 01:32:36.542
as an instructor.

01:32:38.792 --> 01:32:40.626
That was Lam Sir's idea.

01:32:41.751 --> 01:32:43.292
I always go by the book.

01:32:45.209 --> 01:32:46.501
Thank you.

01:32:48.751 --> 01:32:50.167
Thank you.

01:32:54.834 --> 01:32:56.209
One looks for nothing

01:32:56.542 --> 01:32:58.626
but safety and happiness.

01:32:59.376 --> 01:33:01.792
Being No. 1 is a lonely business.

01:33:02.334 --> 01:33:04.084
There is so much one must forsake

01:33:04.626 --> 01:33:06.917
to stand on that narrow peak.

01:33:12.042 --> 01:33:13.209
I'd rather

01:33:13.584 --> 01:33:15.501
take someone's hands

01:33:16.001 --> 01:33:17.876
and brave the world together,

01:33:20.917 --> 01:33:23.459
creating the happiness

01:33:24.042 --> 01:33:26.667
and bearing the bitterness.

01:33:28.334 --> 01:33:30.001
The thought of being No. 1

01:33:30.959 --> 01:33:32.917
never crossed my mind again.
