<b><i>Chain Jail.</i></b>

00:04.000 --> 00:09.090
<b>Chain Jail: 
The Restraining Middle Finger</b>

00:04.920 --> 00:08.130
<b><i>This power can only be used on the spiders...</i></b>

00:09.640 --> 00:12.880
<b><i>A power to capture and 
restrain the Phantom Troupe.</i></b>

00:14.130 --> 00:16.960
<b><i>I've sworn to use this ability 
for no other purpose.</i></b>

00:18.460 --> 00:23.250
<b><i>I've applied the condition that, 
should I use this technique</i></b>

00:25.080 --> 00:30.560
<b><i>on one who is not a spider, 
I will die on the spot.</i></b>

00:34.230 --> 00:37.220
<b><i>A self-imposed restriction, 
and a covenant with myself.</i></b>

00:39.040 --> 00:41.020
<b><i>The proof of my resolve.</i></b>

02:01.970 --> 02:07.020
<b>Restraint x And x Vow</b>

02:10.720 --> 02:12.480
<b>After using Chain Jail</b>

02:12.480 --> 02:14.590
<b>to capture Uvogin, Kurapika</b>

02:14.590 --> 02:17.030
<b>and his fellow bodyguards flee by car.</b>

02:22.580 --> 02:24.930
<b>We have cars behind us.</b>

02:24.930 --> 02:26.290
<b>Someone check it out.</b>

02:26.920 --> 02:28.340
<b>Indeed...</b>

02:28.340 --> 02:29.540
<b>Think it's them?</b>

02:33.800 --> 02:35.370
<b>Kurapika, floor it!</b>

02:35.370 --> 02:36.050
<b>It's a tail!</b>

02:36.410 --> 02:37.330
<b>A tail?</b>

02:37.330 --> 02:38.310
<b>But who?</b>

02:38.960 --> 02:39.800
<b>Could it be?</b>

02:43.820 --> 02:44.630
<b>A thread!</b>

02:44.630 --> 02:46.080
<b>Probably made of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

02:46.080 --> 02:49.940
<b>There's something on his left thigh.</b>

02:51.100 --> 02:52.190
<b>Damn!</b>

02:54.310 --> 02:55.260
<b>They noticed it.</b>

02:55.780 --> 02:57.440
<b>That was faster than expected.</b>

02:57.860 --> 03:00.050
<b>Don't worry. 
We've almost got them!</b>

03:00.050 --> 03:01.320
<b>Whatever...</b>

03:01.570 --> 03:04.040
<b>Why are we all stuffed in this tiny car?</b>

03:04.040 --> 03:05.830
<b>It's just a little longer.</b>

03:11.170 --> 03:14.750
<b>Fun Fun Cloth: 
Convenient Magic Kerchief</b>

03:36.330 --> 03:37.520
<b>What the hell?</b>

03:37.520 --> 03:38.390
<b>Hey!</b>

03:38.390 --> 03:40.070
<b>Let me out, damn it!</b>

03:45.440 --> 03:48.200
<b>You guys really are good.</b>

03:48.630 --> 03:49.860
<b>Given that you were</b>

03:49.860 --> 03:53.550
<b>fast enough to open the door 
and escape in moments.</b>

03:53.550 --> 03:55.790
<b>I'll need to take care.</b>

03:56.390 --> 03:59.170
<b>Nobunaga had an unlucky position...</b>

03:59.170 --> 04:02.300
<b>Anyway, you have an interesting ability.</b>

04:00.700 --> 04:02.300
<b>Let me out, damn it!</b>

04:02.660 --> 04:05.730
<b>You can shrink anything merely 
by using that cloth?</b>

04:05.730 --> 04:08.060
<b>That would be quite handy for theft.</b>

04:08.060 --> 04:12.060
<b>With that thing, you could fit all 
of the treasure in your pocket.</b>

04:12.060 --> 04:15.370
<b>Meaning that he's the one 
who took the treasure</b>

04:15.370 --> 04:17.060
<b>from the auction house.</b>

04:17.060 --> 04:20.520
<b>And so, you can also restore 
everything to its original size.</b>

04:21.330 --> 04:24.570
<b>I believe the boss said he's named Owl.</b>

04:27.630 --> 04:29.830
<b>His friends have arrived to help.</b>

04:29.830 --> 04:30.990
<b>Yes...</b>

04:43.180 --> 04:45.220
<b>There are quite a few of them.</b>

04:51.720 --> 04:53.730
<b>Who are these guys?</b>

04:53.730 --> 04:56.730
<b>Are they really Phantom Troupe members?</b>

04:56.730 --> 04:58.980
<b>Yeah, definitely.</b>

04:58.980 --> 05:01.240
<b>But they look so weak.</b>

05:01.970 --> 05:04.170
<b>One, two, three...</b>

05:04.630 --> 05:05.390
<b>Huh?</b>

05:05.840 --> 05:07.160
<b>What's wrong?</b>

05:07.160 --> 05:09.700
<b>There are ten total Shadow Beasts, right?</b>

05:09.700 --> 05:13.000
<b>Uvo took care of four,</b>

05:13.000 --> 05:15.030
<b>so this should be the rest.</b>

05:16.180 --> 05:17.470
<b>That is strange.</b>

05:17.470 --> 05:21.500
<b>The chain user grabbed Uvo, 
before escaping by car.</b>

05:21.780 --> 05:25.440
<b>Does that mean the chain 
user isn't a Shadow Beast?</b>

05:26.010 --> 05:28.660
<b>Well, we'll know once we ask them...</b>

05:29.630 --> 05:31.230
<b>Should we keep them all alive?</b>

05:31.230 --> 05:35.020
<b>No, we require only Owl.</b>

05:35.440 --> 05:37.520
<b>Then I'll handle that.</b>

05:37.520 --> 05:41.380
<b>Those damned kids are talking smack.</b>

05:41.380 --> 05:44.030
<b>Let's show them how scary the 
Shadow Beasts can be.</b>

05:44.550 --> 05:45.870
<b>Did you hear that?</b>

05:45.870 --> 05:48.160
<b>Shalnark, you just stand 
there and watch.</b>

05:48.390 --> 05:49.720
<b>I'll take three.</b>

05:49.720 --> 05:51.160
<b>Shizuku can have the other two.</b>

05:51.540 --> 05:52.410
<b>Got it.</b>

05:52.950 --> 05:54.160
<b>Don't get cocky!</b>

05:54.480 --> 05:55.400
<b>Keep your cool!</b>

05:55.400 --> 05:57.160
<b>Don't underestimate their strength!</b>

05:57.530 --> 05:59.170
<b>Shut up!</b>

06:03.910 --> 06:05.010
<b>We lost them.</b>

06:05.660 --> 06:08.410
<b>But what was it that I just saw</b>

06:08.410 --> 06:10.430
<b>landing on the roof of their car?</b>

06:10.430 --> 06:13.050
<b>Probably one of the 
remaining Shadow Beasts.</b>

06:13.050 --> 06:16.060
<b>This is our chance to 
hurry back to the city.</b>

06:16.400 --> 06:17.360
<b>Roger that.</b>

06:17.360 --> 06:20.010
<b>We'll switch the location to pattern C.</b>

06:20.010 --> 06:23.630
<b>And we don't want Muscles 
here putting up a fight,</b>

06:23.630 --> 06:26.820
<b>so we'll need muscle relaxants 
and sleeping gas.</b>

06:27.450 --> 06:29.640
<b>I hope those will work...</b>

06:35.330 --> 06:37.080
<b>Move, and you'll get cut.</b>

06:42.920 --> 06:44.020
<b>Okay, all done.</b>

06:44.650 --> 06:46.090
<b>What about the bodies?</b>

06:46.450 --> 06:47.860
<b>Just leave them.</b>

06:47.860 --> 06:49.840
<b>No point hiding them now.</b>

06:51.470 --> 06:54.190
<b>Okay, let's free Nobunaga</b>

06:54.190 --> 06:56.970
<b>before we start torturing this guy.</b>

06:56.970 --> 06:58.350
<b>Hold on.</b>

06:58.740 --> 07:01.740
<b>We're taking Owl in the car with us, right?</b>

07:02.270 --> 07:05.640
<b>There's no room, so let's 
leave Nobunaga as he is.</b>

07:05.640 --> 07:07.860
<b>Screw that! Let me out!</b>

07:08.110 --> 07:10.360
<b>I don't want to be cramped, either.</b>

07:10.360 --> 07:11.610
<b>Come on!</b>

07:10.770 --> 07:14.190
<b>Hey, can you release the car alone?</b>

07:11.610 --> 07:13.660
<b>I know you can hear me!</b>

07:14.520 --> 07:16.100
<b>You're really making me mad!</b>

07:14.750 --> 07:16.700
<b>Th-That's impossible...</b>

07:16.680 --> 07:18.300
<b>Let me out, already!</b>

07:16.700 --> 07:18.110
<b>Too bad.</b>

07:18.110 --> 07:19.900
<b>So much for that...</b>

07:19.060 --> 07:20.750
<b>Hey! What's going on?</b>

07:28.350 --> 07:29.380
<b>You bastards were</b>

07:29.600 --> 07:31.810
<b>making a fool out of me!</b>

07:31.810 --> 07:33.900
<b>Troupe members aren't 
supposed to snap at one other.</b>

07:33.900 --> 07:34.880
<b>Shut up!</b>

07:35.580 --> 07:39.560
<b>Anyway, this ability could come 
in handy for our job.</b>

07:39.560 --> 07:40.670
<b>Shut your mouth!</b>

07:40.670 --> 07:42.760
<b>I'm cutting this guy to shreds!</b>

07:42.760 --> 07:43.870
<b>No.</b>

07:43.870 --> 07:47.610
<b>He's going to tell us 
where the treasure is...</b>

07:47.880 --> 07:50.110
<b>Feitan's going to use his skill at torture.</b>

07:50.610 --> 07:52.860
<b>You just have bad luck.</b>

07:56.430 --> 07:58.620
<b>Damn it!</b>

08:02.810 --> 08:04.520
<b>Hey, wake up!</b>

08:25.300 --> 08:26.400
<b>You understand</b>

08:26.400 --> 08:28.760
<b>what's happening here?</b>

08:29.230 --> 08:32.650
<b>Where did you put the 
stolen merchandise?</b>

08:36.550 --> 08:38.410
<b>What time is it?</b>

08:40.380 --> 08:42.910
<b>How long have I been asleep?</b>

08:44.610 --> 08:47.790
<b>It seems that you don't grasp 
your current situation.</b>

08:49.170 --> 08:53.050
<b>I'm asking the questions here!</b>

09:01.830 --> 09:04.290
<b><i>Incredible mental fortitude...</i></b>

09:05.270 --> 09:09.120
<b><i>He's well aware that he's 
about to be tortured,</i></b>

09:09.120 --> 09:12.980
<b><i>but the aura around his 
body remains firm.</i></b>

09:14.180 --> 09:19.330
<b><i>That iron body is built 
on a rock-solid spirit.</i></b>

09:19.710 --> 09:22.080
<b><i>That is why his aura is so strong.</i></b>

09:22.580 --> 09:25.210
<b><i>The product of countless battles.</i></b>

09:33.260 --> 09:35.880
<b>I'm asking the questions here!</b>

09:40.640 --> 09:43.000
<b><i>Incredible mental fortitude...</i></b>

09:44.060 --> 09:47.880
<b><i>He's well aware that he's 
about to be tortured,</i></b>

09:47.880 --> 09:51.640
<b><i>but the aura around his 
body remains firm.</i></b>

09:53.020 --> 09:58.160
<b><i>That iron body is built 
on a rock-solid spirit.</i></b>

09:58.160 --> 10:00.910
<b><i>That is why his aura is so strong.</i></b>

10:01.260 --> 10:04.000
<b><i>The product of countless battles.</i></b>

10:07.720 --> 10:09.270
<b><i>Can I move?</i></b>

10:09.980 --> 10:11.670
<b><i>No...</i></b>

10:12.670 --> 10:15.520
<b><i>I won't recover for a while.</i></b>

10:16.450 --> 10:19.280
<b><i>I had dinner around 8.</i></b>

10:19.280 --> 10:22.320
<b><i>Judging by my stomach, 
it's around midnight now.</i></b>

10:26.180 --> 10:27.940
<b>Let's make a deal.</b>

10:29.720 --> 10:33.690
<b>I'll spare your lives, so let me up now.</b>

10:35.130 --> 10:36.940
<b>Wh-What is he saying?</b>

10:36.940 --> 10:38.340
<b>Is he insane?!</b>

10:39.460 --> 10:40.540
<b>He's serious.</b>

10:41.080 --> 10:42.300
<b>I think.</b>

10:42.860 --> 10:44.950
<b>What? Are you crazy?</b>

10:45.920 --> 10:49.230
<b>He's the one who should 
be begging for his life.</b>

10:52.050 --> 10:53.960
<b>Let me make something clear.</b>

10:55.250 --> 10:58.970
<b>We're after the auction merchandise 
that was stored underground.</b>

10:59.370 --> 11:01.960
<b>If you guys don't know where it is,</b>

11:01.960 --> 11:03.320
<b>I have no business with you.</b>

11:05.510 --> 11:06.520
<b>What?</b>

11:06.520 --> 11:07.980
<b>Wait a moment.</b>

11:08.460 --> 11:10.800
<b>You didn't steal the merchandise?</b>

11:11.720 --> 11:14.230
<b>The safe was empty when we arrived.</b>

11:14.860 --> 11:18.590
<b>The Shadow Beasts had 
already taken it all.</b>

11:18.590 --> 11:22.240
<b>I guess they didn't bother 
telling grunts like you.</b>

11:24.540 --> 11:27.390
<b>I don't think he's lying...</b>

11:29.250 --> 11:31.350
<b>Then he's serious?</b>

11:31.350 --> 11:35.000
<b>When he offered to make a 
deal, he wasn't bluffing?</b>

11:39.580 --> 11:41.880
<b>Everyone makes mistakes...</b>

11:42.380 --> 11:45.380
<b>We haven't stolen anything yet.</b>

11:45.380 --> 11:47.120
<b>So take these off,</b>

11:47.120 --> 11:50.030
<b>and pretend you didn't see anything.</b>

11:50.680 --> 11:52.270
<b>If you do that,</b>

11:53.410 --> 11:55.520
<b>you get to live!</b>

12:00.650 --> 12:02.370
<b>What about the guests?</b>

12:02.370 --> 12:03.280
<b>Guests?</b>

12:04.060 --> 12:06.660
<b>The guests who were in the auction hall.</b>

12:06.660 --> 12:08.540
<b>Some of our colleagues were there.</b>

12:09.090 --> 12:10.180
<b>Answer me.</b>

12:12.180 --> 12:13.090
<b>I see.</b>

12:13.090 --> 12:15.040
<b>That's too bad...</b>

12:16.160 --> 12:17.260
<b>We killed them.</b>

12:17.260 --> 12:18.550
<b>It was part of our plan—</b>

12:21.160 --> 12:23.390
<b>How many lives do you think you took</b>

12:23.390 --> 12:25.430
<b>to carry out that plan of yours?!</b>

12:25.840 --> 12:27.380
<b>Stop, Kurapika!</b>

12:28.960 --> 12:30.310
<b>Stop it!</b>

12:30.640 --> 12:32.500
<b>If the merchandise is in safe hands,</b>

12:32.500 --> 12:34.400
<b>we don't need him.</b>

12:34.400 --> 12:36.560
<b>We'll hand him over to the community.</b>

12:37.560 --> 12:39.820
<b>So, no deal?</b>

13:06.420 --> 13:09.280
<b>Oh, did you find out what 
became of the merchandise?</b>

13:09.280 --> 13:11.220
<b>Shut up! Ask Feitan!</b>

13:22.070 --> 13:24.490
<b>Did he tell you where the merchandise is?</b>

13:24.930 --> 13:26.830
<b>It was no fun...</b>

13:26.830 --> 13:30.490
<b>I'd barely gotten started, but he gave in.</b>

13:30.990 --> 13:32.840
<b>Oh, so that's it.</b>

13:46.270 --> 13:47.760
<b>Ah, I just remembered.</b>

13:48.560 --> 13:51.170
<b>I was supposed to meet someone today.</b>

13:51.720 --> 13:52.990
<b>I'll be heading out.</b>

13:53.370 --> 13:55.180
<b>Sure, go ahead.</b>

13:55.720 --> 13:58.180
<b>As long as you return by 6 PM tomorrow.</b>

13:59.860 --> 14:02.150
<b>Up to some mischief, Hisoka?</b>

14:02.980 --> 14:04.550
<b>But of course.</b>

14:12.880 --> 14:14.040
<b>Damn...</b>

14:39.420 --> 14:42.190
<b><i>"Let us meet at the agreed upon place."</i></b>

15:05.950 --> 15:07.720
<b>Where's Shalnark?</b>

15:08.290 --> 15:10.170
<b>He just called.</b>

15:10.170 --> 15:13.720
<b>He's succeeded in locating 
a Mafia comms room.</b>

15:15.180 --> 15:18.730
<b>This is Dalzollene of the Nostrade Family.</b>

15:19.300 --> 15:22.220
<b>We've captured one of the bandits 
who attacked the auction</b>

15:22.220 --> 15:23.760
<b>and wish to hand him over.</b>

15:23.760 --> 15:24.910
<b>Really?</b>

15:24.910 --> 15:26.460
<b>How did you manage that?</b>

15:26.460 --> 15:28.490
<b>I can provide further details later.</b>

15:28.850 --> 15:30.570
<b>That's impressive...</b>

15:30.570 --> 15:32.500
<b>The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance.</b>

15:32.850 --> 15:34.790
<b>The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance?</b>

15:34.790 --> 15:37.490
<b>Yeah, they were completely wiped out.</b>

15:39.150 --> 15:40.530
<b><i>Wiped out...</i></b>

15:41.140 --> 15:43.250
<b>Well, where are you right now?</b>

15:44.920 --> 15:46.750
<b>Okay, got it.</b>

15:47.180 --> 15:49.040
<b>Move quickly.</b>

15:49.040 --> 15:52.000
<b>Yeah, we'll bring our best people.</b>

15:59.550 --> 16:02.340
<b>I gave him three canisters 
of muscle relaxants.</b>

16:02.340 --> 16:03.450
<b>Understood.</b>

16:03.450 --> 16:06.610
<b>The Mafia will be here soon.</b>

16:06.610 --> 16:10.190
<b>I'll watch him until then, 
so get some rest, everyone.</b>

16:10.190 --> 16:11.330
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:51.990 --> 16:53.800
<b>You move fast.</b>

17:00.340 --> 17:02.280
<b><i>He isn't using</i> In.</b>

17:02.750 --> 17:04.670
<b>No need for concern.</b>

17:05.020 --> 17:07.420
<b>I have no interest in fighting you now...</b>

17:08.880 --> 17:10.550
<b>I'm not here for idle chat!</b>

17:11.200 --> 17:14.160
<b>Tell me about your organization.</b>

17:14.880 --> 17:16.280
<b>Really?</b>

17:16.280 --> 17:19.050
<b>I love idle chat.</b>

17:23.910 --> 17:26.550
<b>There are thirteen spiders,</b>

17:26.550 --> 17:29.940
<b>identifiable by their 
numbered spider tattoos.</b>

17:30.770 --> 17:33.940
<b>Members can change at 
a moment's notice.</b>

17:34.590 --> 17:38.230
<b>An applicant defeating a standing 
member replaces them.</b>

17:39.080 --> 17:41.220
<b>If the Troupe loses one for other reasons,</b>

17:41.220 --> 17:43.910
<b>the boss selects the replacement.</b>

17:45.090 --> 17:48.100
<b>The Troupe focuses primarily 
on stealing and killing.</b>

17:48.100 --> 17:50.560
<b>Sometimes, they perform 
philanthropic work.</b>

17:50.560 --> 17:52.230
<b>I already know all of that.</b>

17:52.770 --> 17:54.980
<b>Two or three years ago,</b>

17:54.980 --> 17:58.030
<b>I replaced the man who was #4.</b>

17:58.030 --> 17:59.130
<b>For what purpose?</b>

17:59.820 --> 18:02.490
<b>So that I could fight the boss.</b>

18:02.490 --> 18:03.940
<b>The boss?</b>

18:03.940 --> 18:05.520
<b>Why would you want that?</b>

18:06.520 --> 18:08.280
<b>Because he is strong...</b>

18:09.840 --> 18:12.690
<b>You wished to test your strength?</b>

18:13.270 --> 18:14.590
<b>Perhaps.</b>

18:14.960 --> 18:16.070
<b>But...</b>

18:17.600 --> 18:20.170
<b>It turns me on...</b>

18:20.170 --> 18:23.700
<b>Thinking about fighting the boss...</b>

18:25.350 --> 18:28.490
<b>But I've never had the chance.</b>

18:28.890 --> 18:30.580
<b>He never lowers his guard.</b>

18:32.310 --> 18:35.710
<b>At a minimum, two others 
always accompany him.</b>

18:37.780 --> 18:41.870
<b>And when a job ends, he vanishes.</b>

18:41.870 --> 18:44.240
<b>Without a trace.</b>

18:46.920 --> 18:49.850
<b>So I reached a conclusion 
that benefits us both.</b>

18:50.770 --> 18:54.860
<b>Would you not agree that reaching 
our goals alone will be difficult?</b>

18:56.540 --> 18:58.110
<b>What are you trying to say?</b>

18:59.890 --> 19:02.480
<b>I can tell you the Troupe members' abilities.</b>

19:02.920 --> 19:06.000
<b>There are seven whose 
powers I already know.</b>

19:08.130 --> 19:09.500
<b>Interested...</b>

19:10.160 --> 19:11.710
<b>in teaming up?</b>

19:17.680 --> 19:19.510
<b>Yeah, we're on floor B2.</b>

19:33.210 --> 19:34.220
<b>Thanks.</b>

19:34.220 --> 19:35.770
<b>You haven't killed him yet?</b>

19:36.300 --> 19:37.490
<b>No.</b>

19:37.490 --> 19:38.280
<b>This way.</b>

19:40.480 --> 19:42.760
<b>We couldn't get a needle into him,</b>

19:42.760 --> 19:44.530
<b>so we used paralytic gas.</b>

19:46.640 --> 19:48.540
<b>You clean up nicely.</b>

19:48.540 --> 19:49.270
<b>Huh?</b>

19:59.120 --> 20:01.080
<b>I couldn't believe my ears</b>

20:01.080 --> 20:03.760
<b>when I heard you'd been kidnapped.</b>

20:10.120 --> 20:12.020
<b>Blinky, time for work.</b>

20:18.440 --> 20:21.900
<b>Suck out the poison paralyzing Uvo.</b>

20:28.270 --> 20:29.910
<b>Okay, all done.</b>

20:44.340 --> 20:51.770
<b>Damn!</b>

20:53.270 --> 20:58.060
<b>I'm gonna make that chain user pay...</b>

20:58.060 --> 20:59.480
<b>Wake up, everyone!</b>

21:04.070 --> 21:05.530
<b>Where is he?!</b>

21:06.230 --> 21:07.630
<b>He ran away.</b>

21:07.630 --> 21:09.910
<b>You were too loud.</b>

21:09.910 --> 21:11.430
<b>We're heading back.</b>

21:11.430 --> 21:12.990
<b>Our job here is done.</b>

21:12.990 --> 21:14.920
<b>We also dealt with the Shadow Beasts.</b>

21:15.400 --> 21:17.800
<b>And we got our treasure.</b>

21:17.800 --> 21:18.980
<b>No!</b>

21:24.970 --> 21:27.300
<b>Tell the boss...</b>

21:29.250 --> 21:33.100
<b>I won't go back until I settle up</b>

21:33.100 --> 21:35.000
<b>with that chain user.</b>

21:37.950 --> 21:40.820
<b>Uvogin has been freed.</b>

21:41.610 --> 21:44.950
<b>Kurapika, invited by Hisoka to team up,</b>

21:44.950 --> 21:47.620
<b>is not yet aware of this.</b>

23:01.190 --> 23:06.240
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.190 --> 23:06.490
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.950 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300

<b>Today, we introduce Dalzollene.</b>

23:11.090 --> 23:13.030
<b>Leads Neon's bodyguards.</b>

23:11.460 --> 23:13.200
<b>He's the leader of Neon's bodyguards!</b>

23:13.030 --> 23:19.580
<b>A cruel, impatient man who disposes 
of any who fail to follow orders.</b>

23:13.200 --> 23:15.910
<b>Must be a drag taking care of that selfish brat!</b>

23:15.910 --> 23:18.060
<b>It's a drag for me, taking care of you.</b>

23:18.060 --> 23:19.920
<b>What are you on about?!</b>

23:25.470 --> 23:27.920
<b>Next time: Chasing x And x Waiting.</b>

23:27.920 --> 23:28.800
<b>Hey, Killua,</b>

23:28.800 --> 23:30.470
<b>let's play Drop the Handkerchief.</b>

23:30.470 --> 23:32.660
<b>I'll drop it, and you sit and wait.</b>

23:32.660 --> 23:34.250
<b>You can't play that with two people!</b>
