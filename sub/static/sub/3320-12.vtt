00:02.480 --> 00:04.178
Previously onMom...

00:04.265 --> 00:05.744
CHRISTY: This is Christy
Plunkett, Roscoe'’s mom.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.790
I'’m gonna be keeping
him home today.

00:07.877 --> 00:10.097
No, no, no, um, not sick.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.012
He lost his grandpa.

00:12.099 --> 00:15.798
I spoke to Alvin'’s
ex-wife this morning.Yeah?

00:15.885 --> 00:17.887
She doesn'’t want us
to come to the funeral.

00:19.802 --> 00:23.066
Alvin and I had our problems,
but just before he died,

00:23.153 --> 00:26.548
he came to me and begged me
to take him back.

00:26.635 --> 00:27.505
I can'’t listen
to this.

00:27.592 --> 00:28.506
Get your...

00:28.593 --> 00:29.855
Stay.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.685
He admitted
he'’d made some mistakes.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.383
Two of them are here today.

00:37.559 --> 00:38.777
Okay, that'’s it.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.040
Hold my new purse.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.086
I should have just
let her drink.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.699
Hey, guys.

00:47.786 --> 00:50.006
Well, look who finally
showed up for work.

00:51.790 --> 00:55.055
I mean, so sorry to hear
your father passed away.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.491
Thanks.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.362
Really wish
I'’d gotten to meet...

00:59.494 --> 01:01.148
...Abner.

01:02.671 --> 01:03.802
His name was Alvin.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.021
And you did meet him.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.242
You'’ve been
in this country 30 years.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.895
When are you gonna
lose the accent?

01:11.288 --> 01:12.376
Hey, Gabriel.

01:12.463 --> 01:13.421
Hey, you.

01:14.596 --> 01:15.988
Welcome back.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.207
Thanks.

01:17.294 --> 01:18.382
Ah, this must be hard.

01:18.469 --> 01:19.644
Is it hard?

01:19.731 --> 01:21.211
It seems like it
would be hard.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.561
No, I'’m doing okay.

01:23.648 --> 01:26.651
I think work will help
keep my mind off it.

01:26.738 --> 01:29.045
Really? '’Cause if you need a
few days, you can take them.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.220
No, I'’m good.

01:30.307 --> 01:31.308
Thanks.

01:33.441 --> 01:34.529
Hi.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.008
Any questions about the menu?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.401
Is your risotto vegan?

01:37.488 --> 01:39.273
No, it'’s made
with chicken stock.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.405
Ugh, could my day
get any worse?

01:41.492 --> 01:43.146
Yeah, your father could die!

01:44.669 --> 01:46.541
Okay, I might need
a few more days.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.866
Bill, bill, bill.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.651
Ugh, I am so screwed.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.566
[whoops sarcastically]

02:11.653 --> 02:14.830
Bank of America wants
to give me a new credit card.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.659
Those idiots.

02:17.746 --> 02:20.052
BONNIE: You have no right
to take his stuff!

02:20.140 --> 02:21.706
LORRAINE: Yes, I do,
he was my husband.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.665
What'’s going on?

02:23.752 --> 02:26.233
Maleficent here is stealing
all your dad'’s things.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.540
It is not stealing--
he left everything to me.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.368
Hey, my daughter and I
are in that will, too.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.457
Not according to my lawyer.

02:33.544 --> 02:36.025
I guess you didn'’t mean as much
to him as you thought you did.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.853
Keep telling yourself
that; he loved me.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.855
[scoffs]
Don'’t talk about love.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.771
Alvin and I were
together for 30 years.

02:42.858 --> 02:45.034
And from what he told me,
so were your legs.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.862
That'’s right, you heard me.

02:48.646 --> 02:49.865
Okay, time
to go inside.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.040
Let'’s go inside.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.084
You'’re disgusting.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.434
Alvin didn'’t think so.

02:53.521 --> 02:54.739
I was his last meal.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.700
Then he must have died
of food poisoning.

02:58.787 --> 03:02.965
When his soul left his body,
it migrated to my hoo-ha.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.055
You'’re a sick woman.

03:06.142 --> 03:07.187
[with a deep voice]:
"Lorraine, it'’s Alvin!

03:07.274 --> 03:08.840
Give '’em my stuff!"

03:10.364 --> 03:11.626
Okay, that'’s enough.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.542
"Also, you'’re a hose-bag!"

03:14.629 --> 03:17.066
Okay...

03:17.153 --> 03:18.981
I'’m only gonna
say this once:

03:19.068 --> 03:22.419
The whole dead dad-vagina bit--
never want to see it again.

03:22.506 --> 03:25.074
"Oh, lighten up!"

03:28.208 --> 03:30.166
Before we start, I just want
to express my condolences

03:30.253 --> 03:31.950
for your loss.
Thank you.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.952
I would also want to take
the opportunity to say

03:34.039 --> 03:35.476
what a delight it is to have
your daughter

03:35.563 --> 03:37.173
helping me out
at my office.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.131
She'’s a hard worker,
she'’s very sharp...

03:39.219 --> 03:42.309
Yeah, she'’s a gem.
How much is this gonna cost me?

03:42.396 --> 03:45.312
Don'’t worry, Mom, Steve'’s
helping us for free.

03:45.399 --> 03:49.838
Or, as we call it in the
legal profession, pro bono.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.318
Anyway, went down
to the courthouse,

03:51.405 --> 03:53.276
spoke to the court clerk.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.365
The "court clerk" is basically
a secretary for the court.

03:55.452 --> 03:56.366
Okay.

03:56.453 --> 03:57.802
And while I was there,

03:57.889 --> 03:59.195
I petitioned for a copy
of the will.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.588
A "petition" is
a formal request.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.416
Right.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.766
So we could find out
if you were named beneficiaries.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.637
A "beneficiary"
is one who benefits...

04:06.724 --> 04:08.509
Oh, my God, stop.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.990
All right, give me
the bottom line.

04:12.077 --> 04:15.951
The will that'’s on file with
the court is from 15 years ago.

04:16.038 --> 04:17.692
It doesn'’t mention you
or Christy.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.694
Yeah, but what about
the new will?

04:19.781 --> 04:23.045
He told my mom that he had a new
one made that took care of us.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.525
He did, but according
to his lawyer,

04:24.612 --> 04:26.048
he never got around
to signing it.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.571
Are you kidding me?Oh, my God.

04:27.658 --> 04:28.877
And of course
that'’s not gonna happen

04:28.964 --> 04:30.879
now that he'’s, you know, dead.

04:30.966 --> 04:33.185
How much was it gonna be?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.926
You don'’t want to know--
you'’ll just get upset.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.276
Tell me.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.364
Yeah, let'’s hear it.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.669
A hundred grand.

04:38.756 --> 04:39.975
Son of a bitch!
Just kill me.

04:42.107 --> 04:46.329
Okay, what if I were to tell you
that there was a third will,

04:46.416 --> 04:48.157
that he did sign?Is there?

04:48.244 --> 04:49.289
There could be.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.248
Mom...
What?

04:52.335 --> 04:53.554
I'’ve got that bogus
notary stamp.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.556
All I need is a sample
of his handwriting.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.209
Mom!
Work with me!

05:02.911 --> 05:03.868
Hey.
Hi.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.305
Oh, good, you made it.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.567
Mind moving over?

05:06.654 --> 05:08.264
Just sit here.
[pats the seat]

05:08.351 --> 05:09.352
No, that'’s my seat.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.832
Come on, scooch.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.529
Mom, there'’s plenty
of other spots.

05:12.616 --> 05:15.227
No, everybody knows
on Tuesday nights, I sit there.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.751
Well, why don'’t you
shake it up tonight?

05:16.838 --> 05:18.405
Sit here.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.581
I don'’t want to sit there,
I want to sit there

05:20.668 --> 05:22.017
'’cause that'’s my seat.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.323
Mom, let it go.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.324
No.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.847
Move.

05:25.934 --> 05:26.978
Okay, I'’m not rewarding
this behavior.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.153
Find another seat.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.894
Come on, it'’s just a chair.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.896
It'’s not just a chair!

05:31.983 --> 05:33.898
It'’s my whole damn life!

05:33.985 --> 05:36.248
Things I love keep
getting taken away!

05:36.336 --> 05:40.209
My childhood, my home,
my drugs and alcohol,

05:40.296 --> 05:41.558
and now Alvin!

05:41.645 --> 05:43.560
So you listen to me,
old woman!

05:43.647 --> 05:45.562
I am drawing a line
in the sand,

05:45.649 --> 05:47.564
and the sand
is that chair!

05:47.651 --> 05:49.436
Now move your ass!

05:55.833 --> 05:57.705
Thank you.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.669
Ah, damn it, now I have
to go to the bathroom.

06:16.811 --> 06:19.379
So, how you doing?

06:23.470 --> 06:25.385
Here we go.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.735
Thanks again for seeing me.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.301
It'’s very kind of you.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.086
Yes, it is.

06:31.173 --> 06:33.088
Is this Alvin?

06:33.175 --> 06:34.655
LORRAINE:
Yes.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.266
I didn'’t know he wanted
to be cremated.

06:37.353 --> 06:38.267
He didn'’t.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.315
Now, what can I do for you?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.317
Well, [clears throat]
first of all,

06:45.405 --> 06:48.277
I want to apologize
for my mom'’s behavior.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.453
Bet you'’ve been doing that
your whole life.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.107
Pretty much, yeah.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.762
But in her defense...

06:54.849 --> 06:56.111
Yeah...?

06:57.242 --> 07:00.245
The point is...

07:00.332 --> 07:04.380
...she'’s just as devastated
as you are by Alvin'’s death.

07:04.467 --> 07:07.644
Are you really comparing my loss
to your mother'’s?

07:07.731 --> 07:09.994
No, of course not.

07:10.081 --> 07:11.996
I'’m not here for her,

07:12.083 --> 07:14.912
I'’m here for my kids.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.001
I'’m sure you know
that Alvin wrote a second will.

07:17.088 --> 07:19.613
Which he never signed or filed,
what a shame, go on.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.530
Right.

07:23.617 --> 07:27.403
Um, what you may not know is,
um, the money he set aside

07:27.490 --> 07:30.711
for me and my kids
would be a real life-changer.

07:30.798 --> 07:34.366
You know what was
a real life-changer for me?

07:34.454 --> 07:37.631
Finding out my husband had a
daughter he never told me about.

07:37.718 --> 07:38.980
Yeah.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.983
That'’s got to be rough.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.637
But on the plus side,

07:43.724 --> 07:45.943
I hear she'’s a great gal.

07:48.990 --> 07:52.515
So all that stuff
about you being a pole dancer

07:52.602 --> 07:54.386
and a drunk isn'’t true?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.388
Anymore.

07:59.653 --> 08:02.743
Well, you'’ve given me
a lot to think about.

08:02.830 --> 08:06.747
I understand this is difficult,
so take all the time you need.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.183
No.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.883
No, you don'’t need
a lot of time?

08:12.970 --> 08:15.190
No, you'’re not getting a penny.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.587
I'’m standing,
do you know what that means?

08:24.416 --> 08:27.332
Okay, well...
[sighs]

08:27.419 --> 08:29.378
I guess there'’s
nothing left to say.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.163
I'’ll let myself out.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.909
You know, if I wasn'’t
such a great gal,

08:39.996 --> 08:42.173
I would tell you
to go screw yourself.

08:43.304 --> 08:46.047
So instead I will say,

08:46.134 --> 08:47.831
"Good day."

08:51.661 --> 08:52.967
She had him cremated?!

08:53.054 --> 08:54.098
Yeah.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.623
That vindictive bitch!

08:56.710 --> 08:59.190
Come on, Mom,
what difference does it make?

08:59.277 --> 09:00.931
I'’ll tell you
what difference it makes.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.411
Now I can never visit him.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.544
If there was a grave,
I could go visit.

09:04.631 --> 09:05.545
You know what?

09:05.632 --> 09:07.416
You can visit him in your heart.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.592
No such place.

09:09.679 --> 09:12.639
Please, you need to let this go.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.250
Yeah, I'’ll let it go
right after I...

09:15.337 --> 09:16.251
You know what?

09:16.338 --> 09:17.252
Never mind.

09:19.341 --> 09:20.255
No, n-no! No!

09:20.342 --> 09:21.299
I mind!

09:21.386 --> 09:23.301
Right after you what?

09:23.388 --> 09:25.303
BONNIE:
Not important!

09:25.390 --> 09:26.957
CHRISTY: Why are you
putting your shoes on?

09:27.044 --> 09:29.133
BONNIE: Here, put this shirt
in the laundry for me.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.005
CHRISTY: Mom...BONNIE: Never forget,
I love you.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.963
CHRISTY: Okay, you'’re
really freaking me out now.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.878
I'’ll see you later.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.532
This doesn'’t feel
like you'’re letting it go.

09:36.619 --> 09:37.838
Hey, my pajamas are
in the bathroom,

09:37.925 --> 09:39.622
will you toss
those in, too?

09:39.709 --> 09:41.668
I'’m sorry, but until you
tell me what'’s going on,

09:41.755 --> 09:43.670
I am not letting you
leave this house.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.280
Hey!

09:48.152 --> 09:49.676
BONNIE:
Christy, wake up.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.507
Hiya.

09:59.511 --> 10:00.948
Where have you been?

10:01.035 --> 10:02.253
Righting a wrong.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.647
Oh, God.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.344
What'’d you do?

10:06.431 --> 10:08.651
Lorraine might
have the money,

10:08.738 --> 10:09.957
but I have Alvin.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.614
And a sandwich?

10:20.663 --> 10:24.058
So, what, you broke in
and stole his ashes?

10:24.145 --> 10:25.407
Yes.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.757
But I left the urn.

10:27.844 --> 10:28.758
That'’s the genius.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.064
Lorraine will never know.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.632
Oh, Mom...

10:32.719 --> 10:34.155
She'’ll just be talking
to an empty urn,

10:34.242 --> 10:36.113
but we'’ll be talking
to the real guy.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.202
Right, honey?

10:38.289 --> 10:39.856
Oh, Mom!

10:39.943 --> 10:41.684
Do we have any Tupperware
to put him in

10:41.771 --> 10:43.338
until I find something nice?

10:44.861 --> 10:47.647
We have to take him back.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.779
Oh, no, no!
That'’s crazy!

10:49.866 --> 10:51.955
Yeah, now, see,
you'’re not allowed

10:52.042 --> 10:54.044
to use that word anymore.

10:54.131 --> 10:55.829
You think he'’ll fit in here?

10:55.916 --> 10:58.266
You can'’t put him
in Roscoe'’s thermos!

10:58.353 --> 10:59.397
Well, why not?

10:59.484 --> 11:01.573
It'’ll keep him cool.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.662
Or warm.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.622
[singsong]:
Cra-zy.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.624
Here,
hold your father.

11:08.711 --> 11:09.625
I'’ll get a funnel.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.976
I get that she'’s grieving,

11:13.063 --> 11:14.238
but I'’m at my wit'’s end.

11:14.325 --> 11:15.631
I don'’t know
what to do.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.067
How '’bout nothing?

11:17.154 --> 11:18.590
What?!

11:18.678 --> 11:21.332
My mother broke
into this woman'’s house

11:21.419 --> 11:23.291
and stole my father'’s ashes.

11:23.378 --> 11:24.814
Yeah, but the woman
doesn'’t know.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.337
She'’ll never know.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.339
I thought part of being sober

11:28.426 --> 11:29.819
was being rigorously honest.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.213
Eh... let'’s say rigor-ish.

11:33.997 --> 11:37.174
No, I can'’t live with this.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.394
Maybe I could return him
to his sons,

11:39.481 --> 11:41.483
so it doesn'’t become
a whole thing.

11:41.570 --> 11:44.660
Well, switching out his ashes
worked once.

11:44.747 --> 11:45.966
Why wouldn'’t it work again?

11:47.576 --> 11:48.577
That'’s good.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.886
But I need something, you know,
to put in the thermos.

11:52.973 --> 11:53.974
For heft.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.584
How '’bout kitty litter?

11:56.628 --> 11:58.413
How '’bout I love you?

12:01.024 --> 12:03.287
The only problem is getting
the thermos away from her.

12:03.374 --> 12:06.508
She takes his ashes
around with her?

12:06.595 --> 12:09.511
This morning,
they went to the DMV.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.053
Hey.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.446
What are you doing up?

12:31.533 --> 12:33.013
Thirsty.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.756
Is that kitty litter?

12:38.366 --> 12:40.498
Yes, it is.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.065
Are we getting a cat?

12:42.152 --> 12:43.066
No.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.634
I'’m allergic to cats.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.027
Then what are you doing?

12:49.420 --> 12:50.465
We'’re getting a cat.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.756
[blowing]

13:35.553 --> 13:37.425
Christy?

13:37.512 --> 13:38.774
Yeah?

13:38.861 --> 13:41.037
Close the window,
there'’s a breeze.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.086
Yeah, you got it.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.832
[imitates creaking
window frame]

13:56.009 --> 13:57.401
Thank you.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.360
Sweet dreams, Mom.

14:02.058 --> 14:02.929
Christy?

14:04.191 --> 14:05.453
Yeah?

14:05.540 --> 14:06.933
I'’m sorry, it'’s a little stuffy.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.935
Open the window?

14:13.156 --> 14:15.028
[imitates creaking
window frame]

14:22.296 --> 14:25.081
So, long story short,

14:25.168 --> 14:26.735
I just wanted
to return my dad.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.737
Your dad. Our dad.

14:30.434 --> 14:31.783
You don'’t have
to weigh him,

14:31.871 --> 14:33.960
he'’s all there.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.353
Wait a minute--
i-if this is him,

14:36.440 --> 14:38.007
then what'’s in the urn
at our house?

14:38.094 --> 14:40.401
According to my mom, Grape-Nuts.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.795
Then what does your mother have
in her urn?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.319
I went with kitty litter.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.147
Scoopable. Unscented.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.541
Okay, fine,

14:50.628 --> 14:52.239
but why aren'’t you returning
this to our mother?

14:52.326 --> 14:55.895
I was actually hoping
we could keep this between us

14:55.982 --> 14:59.594
and you could just switch out
the Grape-Nuts with...

14:59.681 --> 15:00.987
Toasted Daddy-O'’s.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.948
[laughing]: It is kind of funny,
if you think about it.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.646
Mom'’s been yelling
at part of a balanced breakfast.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.344
This isn'’t a joke.

15:10.431 --> 15:12.737
Her mom stole Dad'’s ashes

15:12.824 --> 15:13.869
because she couldn'’t
steal his money.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.436
Excuse me,

15:15.523 --> 15:17.568
she was not trying
to steal his money.

15:17.655 --> 15:20.484
Alvin wanted to leave us
something, but--

15:22.834 --> 15:25.315
You know what, that'’s, um,
not why I'’m here.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.404
I just wanted to return him.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.015
I'’m sorry I dragged you
into this.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.059
Your mom'’s crazy.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.018
Yes, she is.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.935
But she also
really loved your father.

15:37.762 --> 15:40.374
So did I.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.592
This is crap.

15:41.679 --> 15:42.680
I-I'’ve got a business to run.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.295
Sorry about him.

15:48.382 --> 15:50.036
I wish I could say

15:50.123 --> 15:51.298
he'’s been kind of a
douche since Dad died,

15:51.385 --> 15:52.821
but the truth is,

15:52.908 --> 15:55.215
he has always been
kind of a douche.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.085
Please.

15:57.434 --> 15:58.696
It'’s cool.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.220
We'’ve all been through a lot.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.091
Yeah, I haven'’t been
sleeping so good.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.440
Neither have I.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.529
Thank God for weed, huh?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.229
Yeah, I can'’t do that anymore,

16:09.316 --> 16:11.057
'’cause I'’m... sober.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.059
Oh, right.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.757
How'’s that working out for you?

16:15.844 --> 16:18.281
Well, pretty good.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.501
Except when your dad dies,
of course.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.503
And then you feel sad,

16:22.590 --> 16:24.461
but you can'’t drink anything
to make you not feel sad,

16:24.548 --> 16:26.463
so you just feel sad

16:26.550 --> 16:28.161
and, as you know,

16:28.248 --> 16:31.773
feeling sad is... sad.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.428
I'’d like to say I know
what you'’re talking about,

16:34.515 --> 16:36.299
but I'’ve been so baked
since the funeral

16:36.386 --> 16:38.084
I can barely see you.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.784
[TV playing indistinctly]

16:42.871 --> 16:44.786
Ooh, Ice Road Truckers.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.789
Are you serious?

16:47.876 --> 16:50.270
What?
Your father loves that show.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.141
Come on, Mom.

16:52.228 --> 16:54.404
You get that he'’s
not really here.

16:54.491 --> 16:55.405
I know that.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.059
But it comforts me, okay?

16:57.146 --> 16:58.408
Okay.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.022
There you go.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.938
[knocking on door]

17:07.026 --> 17:09.028
You two sit.
I got it.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.685
Hi.

17:14.771 --> 17:15.685
How'’s it going?Hey.

17:15.772 --> 17:17.601
This is a surprise.

17:17.688 --> 17:18.602
Come on in.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.082
Sure.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.257
You remember my mom.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.258
Hi.
Hi.

17:22.345 --> 17:23.520
Did she send you?

17:23.607 --> 17:26.045
No, she doesn'’t know we'’re here.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.698
And she doesn'’t know
about this, either.

17:27.785 --> 17:28.873
I don'’t understand.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.788
Open it.

17:33.226 --> 17:34.749
Oh, my God,
that'’s a lot of money.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.185
Yeah, I'’m generally
the good brother,

17:36.272 --> 17:38.709
but it was
actually his idea.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.189
Why?

17:40.276 --> 17:41.669
It was what Dad wanted.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.715
And I'’m not always a douche.

17:47.675 --> 17:50.895
Douglas, uh, went through
the books at the body shop

17:50.982 --> 17:53.246
and "discovered" that
you have been working there

17:53.333 --> 17:55.422
for almost two years
without being paid.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.901
If it makes you feel any better,

17:56.988 --> 17:58.251
you'’re Employee of the Month.

17:59.643 --> 18:02.124
Mom, look at this.

18:02.211 --> 18:05.867
Did I, maybe,
work at the body shop, too?

18:05.954 --> 18:07.347
No, you did not.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.916
You guys, this is...
so generous.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.048
DOUGLAS:
Nah.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.050
Oh.
Thank you.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.749
I hate not having Alvin around,

18:18.836 --> 18:21.752
but I sure do like
having brothers.

18:21.839 --> 18:23.145
It'’s nice havin'’ a sister.

18:23.232 --> 18:24.886
Yeah.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.194
Okay, well, um...

18:28.281 --> 18:30.065
I guess we'’ll be
seeing you around.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.240
Bye.
Wait.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.548
There'’s something
I have tell you.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.289
I have your father.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.117
What'’s that, now?

18:40.162 --> 18:41.250
Here.

18:41.337 --> 18:42.643
He-he should be with you.

18:42.730 --> 18:45.602
Uh, well, I don'’t
understand.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.126
Your mother has an urn

18:47.213 --> 18:49.606
filled with high-fiber cereal
on her mantle.

18:49.693 --> 18:50.738
This is your father.

18:55.395 --> 18:58.572
Okay, um... well,
I... I'’m surprised.

19:00.617 --> 19:03.142
Douglas?

19:04.534 --> 19:06.406
Shocked and dismayed.

19:07.972 --> 19:10.758
I'’m really sorry.

19:10.845 --> 19:11.759
Nicely done.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.457
Do you guys want
to hang out for a while?

19:14.544 --> 19:16.285
Have a cup of coffee?

19:16.372 --> 19:17.591
Yeah, I'’d-I'’d
like that.Sounds good.

19:17.678 --> 19:18.983
You know what?

19:19.070 --> 19:21.421
This is a moment
we should remember.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.771
Let'’s take a picture,
all right?

19:23.858 --> 19:25.555
Okay.

19:25.642 --> 19:26.643
Ready?

19:26.730 --> 19:28.602
And... cheese!

19:30.038 --> 19:31.953
[phone chimes]

19:37.741 --> 19:39.613
That bitch.

19:48.926 --> 19:51.102
It'’s so beautiful
here, Alvin.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.626
I thought you might like it.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.280
Oh, it'’s perfect.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.759
Like you.

20:02.288 --> 20:05.813
Hey, do you remember that scene
in From Here to Eternity

20:05.900 --> 20:07.945
with Burt Lancaster
and Deborah Kerr

20:08.032 --> 20:09.599
when they make love on the sand

20:09.686 --> 20:11.340
with the surf washing over '’em?

20:11.427 --> 20:13.429
Oh, that was so hot.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.517
Do you want to try it?

20:14.604 --> 20:16.084
Really? Why don'’t we

20:16.171 --> 20:17.564
just wrap your
penis in sandpaper?

20:19.087 --> 20:20.610
Come on,

20:20.697 --> 20:22.830
anybody can have sex in a bed.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.833
[sighs] All right, but
just so we'’re clear,

20:25.920 --> 20:28.662
I'’m Burt, you'’re Deborah.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.141
Deal.[soft chuckle]

20:33.928 --> 20:35.712
Hey.

20:35.799 --> 20:39.238
He'’ll always be mine,
you'’ll never have--
