00:00.140 --> 00:01.859
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.859 --> 00:04.769
- He's been helping me.
- That woman has lied

00:04.770 --> 00:07.709
- and threatened my family.
- She's done horrible things.

00:07.710 --> 00:09.750
- 'Cause she's sick.
- I want no part of this.

00:09.830 --> 00:12.129
Brandon has something to tell you both.

00:12.130 --> 00:15.600
It's about Dani. We... had sex.

00:15.870 --> 00:17.385
Am I seeing you tonight?

00:17.415 --> 00:18.879
Oh, no, I have that dinner.

00:18.880 --> 00:19.899
Is Emma gonna be there?

00:19.900 --> 00:22.020
This is a team dinner.
She's not on the team.

00:22.220 --> 00:24.569
It's my parents. They're getting a divorce.

00:24.570 --> 00:26.529
How'd it go? The wrestling thing?

00:26.530 --> 00:28.309
- I didn't even go.
- What? Why?

00:28.310 --> 00:30.619
Hayley stopped by.
Her parents are getting divorced.

00:30.620 --> 00:33.019
Hayley's known about this for months.

00:33.020 --> 00:35.230
- Stop!
- What's wrong?

00:35.440 --> 00:37.829
We tried to have sex. I freaked out.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.650
Like a panic attack.

00:40.300 --> 00:41.290
I was raped.

00:42.180 --> 00:43.859
I thought I put it behind me,

00:43.860 --> 00:48.360
but I have still have some stuff
I have to work through.

00:48.460 --> 00:49.860
Take as long as you need.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.699
Please, we'll take care of everything

00:56.700 --> 00:58.160
and we'll do all of the clean-up.

00:58.170 --> 00:59.589
It'll be like a night off.

00:59.590 --> 01:01.620
We'll even let you have some leftovers.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.789
Can I? Well, that's so sweet.

01:03.790 --> 01:06.420
- Please?
- What's happening?

01:06.830 --> 01:08.829
Mariana's cooking dinner
for everyone tomorrow night.

01:08.830 --> 01:10.989
- Not for you.
- Great. I'll order pizza.

01:10.990 --> 01:12.880
I thought you were going out with Mat.

01:12.910 --> 01:15.440
Hayley and I are making dinner
for Mat and Jesus.

01:15.890 --> 01:18.249
- Good luck, bro.
- Wait a minute. I did not say yes.

01:18.250 --> 01:21.080
Please? Hayley's mom studied
at the Gordon Blue.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.609
- It's Cordon Bleu.
- Whatever.

01:23.610 --> 01:26.640
Her mom's a great cook
and she taught Hayley everything.

01:26.670 --> 01:29.769
But wait. How did you know
that I was going out with Mat?

01:29.770 --> 01:31.370
He asked if it was OK.

01:32.210 --> 01:33.830
He sounds like a real gentleman.

01:33.870 --> 01:36.049
See? Some people ask before they

01:36.050 --> 01:38.280
hook up with people's
best friends and sisters.

01:38.770 --> 01:41.000
Does Mat know about this dinner?

01:41.490 --> 01:43.239
Well, no, but...

01:43.240 --> 01:45.129
Usually, when a guy asks you on a date,

01:45.130 --> 01:47.370
it means he wants to be alone with you.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.049
- She's scared of him.
- I am not.

01:51.050 --> 01:53.430
- She is.
- I'm not scared of him!

01:54.620 --> 01:57.759
- So?
- Yes. It's all right with me.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.509
But only because you promised me leftovers.

01:59.510 --> 02:02.220
Yay! Gonna call Hayley, plan the menu.

02:04.270 --> 02:05.640
Why is she scared of him?

02:09.100 --> 02:10.529
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

02:10.530 --> 02:14.210
but my PO just told me
I get to go home next week.

02:15.490 --> 02:19.280
- Right? Come on!
- Yeah, yeah. Stop it.

02:20.670 --> 02:21.430
Cool!

02:22.600 --> 02:27.120
Yeah. And, um, things
with my mom are, like...

02:27.890 --> 02:29.890
... pretty great, I guess.

02:30.970 --> 02:32.589
She, like, apologized for

02:32.590 --> 02:34.740
everything that happened
when I was younger.

02:36.600 --> 02:40.459
Her boyfriends used to,
like, mess with me and stuff,

02:40.460 --> 02:42.529
and when she didn't wanna deal with it,

02:42.530 --> 02:43.959
she would leave me
with my grandma,

02:43.960 --> 02:46.190
who was getting high all the time.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.040
Anyways...

02:49.710 --> 02:54.110
... she, like, took responsibility
for all of that,

02:54.990 --> 02:58.190
and she got a new apartment,

02:58.490 --> 03:00.990
and it has a bedroom in it for me.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.580
- So I think I'm going home.
- Good for you, Becka.

03:12.170 --> 03:14.520
It's just amazing, Becka, it really is.

03:14.530 --> 03:17.209
You know, you have
come such a long way

03:17.210 --> 03:19.500
since you started here, really.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.850
I mean, how proud are you
right now of yourself?

03:23.560 --> 03:24.520
I'm proud of you.

03:24.620 --> 03:27.549
We have some more
good news, actually. Guess what?

03:27.550 --> 03:30.309
I got a call from the LGBT
home in Lemon Grove,

03:30.310 --> 03:32.420
and guess who has a bed?

03:33.459 --> 03:34.990
- What?
- Yes.

03:35.150 --> 03:36.900
You can move in the middle of the week.

03:38.070 --> 03:39.509
Come on, aren't you happy?

03:39.510 --> 03:41.050
Yeah. No, totally. I...

03:43.000 --> 03:44.950
I'm just surprised is all. I...

03:45.210 --> 03:46.980
... never thought it would happen.

03:47.010 --> 03:49.759
Well, just goes to show you,
you keep after something,

03:49.760 --> 03:51.010
you just might get it.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.629
And speaking of sticking with it,
look who's back here.

03:53.630 --> 03:57.159
Callie has agreed to come
and help us out for Community Day.

03:57.160 --> 04:00.070
I'm assuming that's cool
with everyone? Yes?

04:00.210 --> 04:02.760
- Cool with me.
- Yeah, I think that's great.

04:03.480 --> 04:07.400
What, no snarky comment?
Becka, what happened to you?

04:08.560 --> 04:10.080
Carmen, good?

04:10.470 --> 04:13.040
Sure. I mean, if you're crazy
enough to come back.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.070
Rest of you guys? Come on. Kiara?

04:15.800 --> 04:16.779
Yeah, cool.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.180
Devonee?

04:20.800 --> 04:22.319
Actually, Dev, you know what?

04:22.320 --> 04:24.859
Callie knows everyone else here,
but she doesn't really know you.

04:24.860 --> 04:27.250
Why don't you tell her
a little about yourself?

04:29.980 --> 04:33.239
I'm 16. I come from Riverside.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.630
My mom's a crackhead
so I been on my own most of my life.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.330
I got busted for, um,
selling drugs, vandalism,

04:41.620 --> 04:43.390
oh, and stealing.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.279
I been to juvie four times,
and this is my third group home.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.299
And I wish they would sent me
to the last one I was in,

04:49.300 --> 04:51.560
'cause they didn't have
so many rules and things.

04:51.690 --> 04:54.639
Listen, I get that when you've been
on your own for a long time,

04:54.640 --> 04:57.159
it's really hard to deal
with the rules and expectations.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.079
But guess what? That's what it takes

04:59.080 --> 05:01.659
to be a productive member of society. OK?

05:01.660 --> 05:03.619
This is stuff that your parents
should have taught you,

05:03.620 --> 05:06.290
but as we know,
that doesn't always happen.

05:06.650 --> 05:07.629
I just don't understand

05:07.630 --> 05:09.670
why everyone can't just do what they want.

05:09.830 --> 05:11.770
I mean, it's a free country, right?

05:11.990 --> 05:15.340
Yeah, and I understand
that you don't get it.

05:15.480 --> 05:19.610
And that's why you're here,
to figure it out. Right, Callie?

05:20.390 --> 05:21.120
Right.

06:07.640 --> 06:10.279
Hey, Callie, um, would you wanna like,

06:10.280 --> 06:11.650
bunk with me this weekend?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.620
I thought you had a roommate.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.540
Yeah. Devonee hates me though,

06:16.620 --> 06:17.959
so I'm sure she'd, like,

06:17.960 --> 06:20.219
love an excuse to take
the empty bed in Cole's room.

06:20.220 --> 06:24.580
Um, well, thanks but I don't
wanna hurt Cole's feelings.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.139
Yeah. We were roommates before

06:26.140 --> 06:28.200
and I kinda wanna be
in my old room, anyway.

06:28.230 --> 06:30.530
OK, yeah, no worries.

06:32.030 --> 06:36.879
Hey, Becka, um, I'm super impressed
with how well you're doing.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.060
It's really great to see.

06:39.870 --> 06:41.300
I'm not cutting anymore, either.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.090
That's good.

06:54.820 --> 06:56.420
Um, I'm gonna...

07:00.750 --> 07:03.219
Could you stay in
Becka's room this weekend?

07:03.220 --> 07:06.450
- I mean, would you mind?
- Uh, no. That's fine.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.400
I'm gonna go check on the laundry.

07:16.814 --> 07:19.610
- What's so funny?
- Mama.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.100
She and Jude just got to the campsite

07:21.110 --> 07:24.030
and she sent me this picture
of the outhouse.

07:25.580 --> 07:26.740
That's messed up.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.220
Hey. Mama tells me that you and...

07:33.910 --> 07:36.470
you and Hayley are having sex.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.219
- We're using condoms.
- Well, good. You better be.

07:39.220 --> 07:41.439
That's not what I want
to talk to you about.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.960
- Do we really have to have this talk?
- We do.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.130
You guys just started seeing each other,

07:46.140 --> 07:50.040
and, you know, sex is
a big deal. It's a big step.

07:50.410 --> 07:51.140
I know.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.319
I just want to make sure

07:52.320 --> 07:56.219
that you're respectful,
Jesus, and honest.

07:56.220 --> 07:57.870
I am. I'm really nice to her.

07:58.310 --> 07:59.980
Yeah? Like you were with Emma?

08:00.930 --> 08:03.300
- Emma broke up with me.
- OK.

08:03.890 --> 08:07.449
But, uh, you moved on pretty fast.

08:07.450 --> 08:09.380
You're already having sex.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.330
I, uh, I just...

08:13.890 --> 08:14.739
... just wanna make sure that

08:14.740 --> 08:16.960
you're not getting
in over your head, Jesus,

08:16.970 --> 08:21.530
and... and feeling like you're
obligated before you're ready.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.710
- That's all. Enough said.
- OK.

08:24.110 --> 08:26.659
OK. Get out of here.

08:26.660 --> 08:28.550
Go do some homework.
There's an idea.

08:58.210 --> 09:00.740
So, uh, what's Devonee's story?

09:00.770 --> 09:02.310
She crazy, that one.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.160
Seems like Cole is kinda into her.

09:04.590 --> 09:07.490
He's into her in more ways than
one, you know what I mean?

09:07.810 --> 09:11.000
- Devonee's gay?
- Gay for the stay, more like it.

09:11.370 --> 09:12.949
- What?
- It happens all the time.

09:12.950 --> 09:15.220
Lots of straight girls
get a little while they're here.

09:16.050 --> 09:18.629
But I guess since Cole
identifies as a boy,

09:18.630 --> 09:20.150
that means Devonee's...

09:20.220 --> 09:24.209
- Don't ask me.
- Does Rita know?

09:24.210 --> 09:26.109
There's lots of underground
stuff going on right now

09:26.110 --> 09:27.599
that Rita doesn't know about,

09:27.600 --> 09:29.500
or at least she pretends she don't.

09:31.950 --> 09:34.410
- Um, how many chairs did Rita?
- Fifteen.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.020
So your foster family fell through?

09:43.340 --> 09:46.320
Becka told me. I'm really sorry.

09:49.180 --> 09:49.960
Me too.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.690
I'm getting out soon
and I got no place to go.

09:54.120 --> 09:57.380
- Not like you.
- What does that mean?

09:57.510 --> 10:00.690
I can't find one family
that wants me. You got two.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.429
The Quinns? They don't want me
to live with them.

10:03.430 --> 10:04.609
And even if they did, I...

10:04.610 --> 10:06.880
You wouldn't want
to live with them? Why not?

10:07.400 --> 10:08.659
I barely know them.

10:08.660 --> 10:10.759
Well you barely knew
the Fosters six months ago

10:10.760 --> 10:13.060
- and they're not even blood.
- OK, sure.

10:13.310 --> 10:15.409
- What about my brother?
- He got adopted without you.

10:15.410 --> 10:16.760
Because I made him.

10:17.370 --> 10:19.549
OK, I get that you are disappointed

10:19.550 --> 10:21.890
because your foster
family didn't work out,

10:22.280 --> 10:24.030
but why are you being a jerk?

10:24.530 --> 10:26.350
Why are you even here?

10:26.630 --> 10:30.030
I know you didn't come back
for the bad food or the lumpy beds.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.110
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you.

10:47.410 --> 10:48.230
It's OK.

10:48.670 --> 10:51.120
- You're not going out tonight?
- Oh, no.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.039
- Any plans for the weekend?
- No.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.400
I just, I think I'm gonna stay in.

10:57.545 --> 10:59.560
You could always crash
your sister's dinner party.

11:00.046 --> 11:01.460
Oh... No, thanks.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.030
Have you, uh, talked to your dad?

11:07.740 --> 11:11.210
Not really, no. I mean,
you know, a little bit.

11:11.550 --> 11:13.280
You know that he doesn't blame you...

11:14.660 --> 11:16.745
... for what happened with Dani, right?

11:16.775 --> 11:18.330
Yeah. I know.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.460
Think you may ever wanna
talk with someone?

11:23.560 --> 11:25.690
- Like a therapist?
- Yeah.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.340
- No.
- Well, think about it. OK?

11:34.800 --> 11:37.210
You don't have to blame
yourself either. You know that?

11:38.310 --> 11:39.180
Ok?

11:40.640 --> 11:42.970
Yeah. I know.

11:43.670 --> 11:44.460
I'm fine.

11:53.850 --> 11:55.210
Good evening, Steve. How are you?

11:55.240 --> 11:58.059
- My motion detector light went off again.
- I know.

11:58.060 --> 12:01.069
- And my dog was barking like a maniac.
- That is not news to us.

12:01.070 --> 12:03.309
We hear your dog barking every day night.

12:03.310 --> 12:06.369
If the girls keep trespassing,
I am gonna call the cops.

12:06.370 --> 12:07.889
Well, if you keep harassing us

12:07.890 --> 12:10.410
every time a squirrel
runs through your bushes,

12:10.440 --> 12:11.479
I'm gonna call the cops.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.449
My garage has been broken into twice.

12:13.450 --> 12:16.560
I know, Steve, you have
told me, more than twice.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.959
Listen, we're having
an open house tomorrow.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.659
Why don't you just come by, OK?

12:21.660 --> 12:23.219
Why don't you meet the girls,

12:23.220 --> 12:25.159
see that work that we actually do here.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.940
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.740
- I wouldn't count on it.
- You have a wonderful evening. OK?

12:34.450 --> 12:38.370
I am gonna get you outta
this house! One way or another!

12:47.300 --> 12:48.489
Callie, I'm sorry you had to hear that.

12:48.490 --> 12:50.540
I didn't know you were in here.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.240
They're not...

12:52.270 --> 12:55.770
He's not really trying to get you guys shut down, is he?

12:57.630 --> 12:59.610
- Can he do that?
- Our lease is up.

13:00.490 --> 13:02.810
He's got all the neighbors in a frenzy,

13:03.010 --> 13:05.480
and they're putting pressure
on the landlord not to renew.

13:06.710 --> 13:09.450
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna fight it.

13:11.010 --> 13:12.510
What else can I do?
It's not that easy

13:12.520 --> 13:14.870
to get a landlord to rent to a group home.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.309
And we don't have
the money to buy our own.

13:17.310 --> 13:18.399
We gotta convince the neighbors

13:18.400 --> 13:20.269
that having us here
is actually a good thing.

13:20.270 --> 13:22.180
Hence, Community Day.

13:23.170 --> 13:26.710
Girls United,
it's not gonna go away, is it?

13:28.250 --> 13:29.970
Not if I have any say in it.

13:42.110 --> 13:43.789
- Oh, my God!
- Sorry.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.119
No, it's OK. Um... Some guy
just ran through the gates.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.250
- I'm gonna go get Rita.
- Wait. Hang on.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.900
I know who it was.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.270
A double-date dinner party?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.490
- Wow. That's fancy.
- I know, right?

14:00.670 --> 14:03.390
Becoming quite the
grown-ups all of a sudden.

14:04.870 --> 14:08.400
So how is it? Ready to kill yourself yet?

14:08.410 --> 14:13.369
- Death by seventh-graders?
- No. No.

14:13.370 --> 14:16.559
The kids are really great.
Jude is having a blast.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.099
It's really... it's really nice

14:18.100 --> 14:20.560
to see him getting
more and more adjusted.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.960
- Good.
- And it's, um...

14:23.820 --> 14:25.120
It's been good for me, too.

14:25.580 --> 14:27.290
You know, being out here in nature,

14:27.340 --> 14:29.060
the mountains and the trees.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.930
Being able to actually see the stars.

14:35.295 --> 14:36.860
It's a good reminder, you know?

14:38.070 --> 14:38.950
Of what?

14:41.580 --> 14:42.950
Of the circle of life.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.230
You know, how nothing is permanent,

14:46.240 --> 14:49.080
not the trees, not the mountains, not us.

14:50.350 --> 14:52.140
Not even our sadness.

14:55.860 --> 14:57.010
I can keep...

14:58.190 --> 15:01.069
I keep thinking about the fact that,

15:01.070 --> 15:02.980
no matter what happens
during the night,

15:04.180 --> 15:05.940
every morning the sun comes up,

15:06.250 --> 15:09.340
again and again, you know?

15:13.150 --> 15:14.070
I love you.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.530
I love you, too.

15:21.640 --> 15:24.440
So, anything else?

15:25.210 --> 15:28.310
Um, well, we, uh, got a letter from Ana.

15:29.550 --> 15:32.530
- What?
- She wants to see the twins,

15:33.160 --> 15:35.290
to "make amends."

15:40.410 --> 15:41.690
What did you do?

15:41.790 --> 15:43.259
Well, I called Mike and told him that

15:43.260 --> 15:46.510
she's never coming anywhere
near our kids, ever again.

15:46.640 --> 15:47.640
Good.

15:52.950 --> 15:57.330
So, um, Devonee told me
you're using street hormones again.

15:58.930 --> 16:02.550
Seriously? After you had
a seizure? Listen, OK.

16:03.020 --> 16:05.379
I won't say anything,
all right, on one condition.

16:05.380 --> 16:08.260
You have to promise me
you will throw them away, OK?

16:08.720 --> 16:10.980
You're gonna be in the new house
in less than a week

16:10.990 --> 16:15.020
and you can see a doctor
as soon as you get there. Deal?

16:22.840 --> 16:26.219
So I worked the program
here at Girls United really hard,

16:26.220 --> 16:28.450
and was able to go back
to my current home.

16:29.570 --> 16:31.119
It was really important
that I was here, you know,

16:31.120 --> 16:33.510
to... to get me on the right track.

16:34.930 --> 16:36.720
But what about gangs?

16:37.080 --> 16:38.919
- I'm sorry?
- Well, Steve was telling me

16:38.920 --> 16:41.159
that some of the girls are in gangs.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.480
Should I be worried about drive-bys?

16:45.390 --> 16:46.320
Shootings.

16:47.060 --> 16:49.009
Oh, I don't think that that's...

16:49.010 --> 16:52.369
Hi. I'm Rita. Met you at the front door.

16:52.370 --> 16:54.089
Actually, we have a wonderful relationship

16:54.090 --> 16:55.249
with the police department.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.379
They do extra patrols in the neighborhood.

16:57.380 --> 16:59.629
So, contrary to what Steve has said,

16:59.630 --> 17:01.900
crime's actually gone down
since we've been here.

17:02.870 --> 17:04.769
- Excuse me, I'm just gonna refill this.
- Sure, Callie.

17:04.770 --> 17:06.400
Can I show you some information?

17:10.260 --> 17:13.060
Callie? Um, Mom, this is Callie.

17:13.069 --> 17:15.118
- Callie, this is my mom, Belinda.
- Hi.

17:15.119 --> 17:16.380
Nice to meet you, Callie.

17:16.910 --> 17:20.010
Callie's the one I was telling
you about, remember?

17:20.460 --> 17:22.618
She's the one who got out,
and is doing really good.

17:22.619 --> 17:24.990
- Oh. How nice.
- Yeah. It was...

17:25.050 --> 17:26.260
It was really inspiring.

17:28.420 --> 17:31.370
I'm just, I'm happy that Becka
gets to go home soon.

17:31.600 --> 17:35.560
- Not as happy as me.
- Um, excuse me, but...

17:38.530 --> 17:40.010
So guess what?

17:40.520 --> 17:42.519
I met a guy. And I know
what you're gonna say,

17:42.520 --> 17:44.850
but I promise, he's really great.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.010
I promise.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.949
I'm telling you, it wasn't there!

17:50.950 --> 17:53.170
Someone stole it,
and I'm pretty sure that it...

17:55.200 --> 17:57.190
Man, these people can talk.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.460
That's saying something, coming from you.

18:00.690 --> 18:02.240
Come on, we should...

18:03.840 --> 18:05.270
I don't wanna go back out there.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.230
Oh, yeah? Rather stay in here
and talk to me instead?

18:09.870 --> 18:13.780
- Get down!
- Stay inside!

18:14.310 --> 18:16.610
- Where'd it come from?
- Get down!

18:19.693 --> 18:21.713
- Hey!
- Hi.

18:21.743 --> 18:24.190
Um, I'm Lou.
I'm in the band with Brandon.

18:24.220 --> 18:27.380
Yeah. Yeah. I know. Why don't you
come on in? How you doing?

18:27.400 --> 18:30.210
- Good, thank you.
- Good, good. What's going on?

18:30.400 --> 18:33.240
I just wanted to drop
this off for Brandon.

18:33.530 --> 18:35.520
- Will you give it to him?
- Oh, he's here.

18:35.771 --> 18:36.863
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:36.893 --> 18:38.419
Why don't you take it up to him yourself?

18:38.420 --> 18:40.769
Uh, I don't want to bother him.

18:40.770 --> 18:42.900
Oh, no, he needs to be bothered. Trust me.

18:43.330 --> 18:46.030
- Go ahead.
- OK.

18:49.020 --> 18:51.039
Look, I know everybody's
a little bit on edge,

18:51.040 --> 18:53.470
but I gotta say I think
we did a lot of good today.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.949
You know? We made
connections with the neighbors.

18:56.950 --> 18:59.699
In fact, one guy from down
the block said he's gonna give us

18:59.700 --> 19:01.790
his old lawnmower tomorrow, so...

19:01.810 --> 19:04.630
Who do you think threw those
firecrackers? The guy next door?

19:05.290 --> 19:07.790
I think we ought to start
harassing him right back.

19:08.000 --> 19:08.910
I might just have to play

19:08.920 --> 19:10.649
a little gangsta rap
at three in the morning,

19:10.650 --> 19:11.599
you know what I mean?

19:11.600 --> 19:13.899
We don't know that
Steve was the one who did that.

19:13.900 --> 19:16.630
You know? It could have just been
some kids trying to be funny.

19:17.130 --> 19:18.150
Hilarious.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.910
I'm sorry, do you have a problem?

19:22.970 --> 19:25.320
If you have something to say,
you should say it.

19:25.350 --> 19:26.860
I just think you're fake, is all.

19:29.810 --> 19:31.710
- Why do you say that?
- Look,

19:31.970 --> 19:33.309
I get why you want all the neighbors

19:33.310 --> 19:34.589
to meet the pretty white girl who

19:34.590 --> 19:37.089
made good after being
in here for like 15 minutes,

19:37.090 --> 19:38.029
but do we have to pretend

19:38.030 --> 19:40.389
that she's like Jehovah
come back to save us?

19:40.390 --> 19:42.680
She's not some amazing success story,

19:42.690 --> 19:44.199
'cause she never had any real stuff to deal

19:44.200 --> 19:45.219
with in the first place.

19:45.220 --> 19:47.299
Shut up, Devonee! You don't know
what you talking about!

19:47.300 --> 19:49.609
- Why you gotta be such a...
- Kiara, easy.

19:49.610 --> 19:51.810
- Well, she's making me mad!
- I know.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.020
But you know a better way
to express your anger.

19:54.030 --> 19:55.039
I'm sorry, but I don't think

19:55.040 --> 19:57.539
you should talk about things
you don't understand.

19:57.540 --> 19:58.550
That's better.

19:59.420 --> 20:02.650
Callie, what would you like to say?

20:05.250 --> 20:06.250
Nothing.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.870
- What is this?
- Vichyssoise.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.770
- What's in it?
- Potatoes, leeks and chicken stock.

20:20.910 --> 20:24.060
- What?
- Um, it's cold.

20:25.090 --> 20:28.550
- Oh, should we microwave it?
- It's supposed to be cold.

20:30.780 --> 20:32.170
It's not bad for cold soup.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.619
It's really good. Where'd you learn
how to cook like this?

20:35.620 --> 20:38.130
Oh. Her mom's like a fancy chef.

20:38.730 --> 20:40.320
So that's where you get it from.

20:40.350 --> 20:42.050
How about you? Do you like to cook?

20:42.900 --> 20:44.480
- Uh...
- She likes to eat.

20:45.470 --> 20:47.460
I should probably try to learn.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.820
If cooking was genetic,
Mariana would be in trouble.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.030
The only thing our birth mom
knew how to cook was crack.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.310
I thought you said you didn't know
anything about your birth mother.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.620
Well, it's not like we grew up with her.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.780
We were with her until we were, like, five.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.500
Can we change the subject, Jesus?

21:06.590 --> 21:07.919
I can't believe you lied to me.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.145
What, like you lied about
your parents getting divorced?

21:10.175 --> 21:11.579
My parents are getting divorced.

21:11.580 --> 21:13.599
- Which you've known about for months.
- Mariana!

21:13.600 --> 21:15.079
What? You made it seem like you

21:15.080 --> 21:16.979
just found out so Jesus
would miss his team dinner.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.519
That's not true! I was upset...

21:19.520 --> 21:21.520
Yeah, that Emma was going to be there!

21:23.230 --> 21:24.880
Is that what you think?

21:26.170 --> 21:27.990
Fine. You know what?

21:28.420 --> 21:30.290
Hayley, wait! Don't! Where are you...?

21:30.780 --> 21:31.650
Nice job.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.140
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

21:38.980 --> 21:41.080
- I... I should probably...
- Hey, you...

21:45.310 --> 21:49.440
My dad, he took off when I was six.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.700
It's not something I tell a lot of people.

21:55.570 --> 21:57.520
It's not really any
of their business, you know?

22:00.580 --> 22:02.580
We should have gone out alone.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.850
Hey, so, um, I think I'm gonna go home.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.790
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.880
You know, Community Day's over, and...

22:44.190 --> 22:47.290
Well, if that's really what you came for.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.539
I mean, you know, Community Day is just

22:51.540 --> 22:53.810
for a couple hours in the afternoon.

22:54.030 --> 22:56.320
You could have just swung by,

22:56.340 --> 23:00.530
but instead you decided to spend
the whole weekend with us.

23:01.710 --> 23:02.870
Why was that, Callie?

23:06.080 --> 23:08.010
If you're ready to go, go.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.290
And if not...

23:11.830 --> 23:12.650
... stay.

23:20.980 --> 23:23.390
- Nice.
- You like?

23:24.412 --> 23:25.218
I thought maybe we could use

23:25.248 --> 23:27.210
a little bit of this vibe
in some of our songs.

23:30.260 --> 23:32.610
- What?
- Nothing.

23:33.540 --> 23:36.790
Love songs. They're just...
funny, when you think about it.

23:37.510 --> 23:40.959
- How so?
- Just all the "You're the only one,

23:40.960 --> 23:42.720
I'll die without you" crap.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.400
It's so weird how everyone
writes like that.

23:46.600 --> 23:50.010
- Why?
- Do you believe that stuff?

23:50.800 --> 23:54.560
- "I'll die without you"?
- No.

23:54.970 --> 23:55.950
I guess not.

23:57.190 --> 24:01.020
But I do think that... we're all
looking for someone who gets us.

24:01.510 --> 24:05.669
And, you know, once we find that person,

24:05.670 --> 24:09.160
you just really, really wanna
hang onto them, you know?

24:11.220 --> 24:13.600
Yeah, but you can't hang on to people.

24:14.530 --> 24:16.179
People aren't things.
It doesn't work like that.

24:16.180 --> 24:17.490
Tell me about it.

24:18.560 --> 24:19.750
Oh, I love this part.

24:21.130 --> 24:24.620
* Put the cozen in confess *

24:24.970 --> 24:26.319
* Pull the strings out *

24:26.320 --> 24:29.279
* My heart's out you *

24:29.280 --> 24:32.640
* In motion in progress *

24:32.830 --> 24:33.849
* As we fall *

24:33.850 --> 24:37.450
* in the deepest pool *

24:40.190 --> 24:42.610
You know, for a girl who
doesn't believe in love songs,

24:43.270 --> 24:44.920
you sure sing 'em well.

24:48.130 --> 24:50.100
So what are you doing
home on a Saturday night?

24:53.090 --> 24:54.240
I don't know.

24:55.090 --> 24:56.740
What're you doing here?

24:57.490 --> 24:58.990
On a Saturday night?

25:18.740 --> 25:22.250
I... I should probably
take off. I've got plans.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.400
See you.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.590
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

25:36.880 --> 25:40.960
I wanted to say thank you
for shutting up Devonee in group.

25:43.220 --> 25:44.660
You're right, you know.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.770
I didn't come back just for the lumpy beds.

25:49.950 --> 25:52.130
And I sure as hell didn't
come back to be some sort of

25:53.250 --> 25:55.440
"success story", You know?

25:56.220 --> 25:58.113
If anything, it just makes me feel worse,

25:58.143 --> 26:00.693
pretending like I've got it all together.

26:00.730 --> 26:02.320
I'm sorry I was being such a bitch.

26:04.290 --> 26:05.980
I'm having a hard time right now.

26:06.450 --> 26:07.580
You're allowed.

26:09.030 --> 26:11.820
But what's going on with you? Is it Wyatt?

26:12.600 --> 26:13.450
How'd you know?

26:13.480 --> 26:15.730
You haven't talked about him
the whole time you've been here.

26:15.890 --> 26:18.020
Um, we're kinda taking a break.

26:18.190 --> 26:19.570
Taking a break? Why?

26:24.800 --> 26:29.490
How long did it take you
to have sex after, you know...

26:30.180 --> 26:32.430
- What? After I was raped?
- Yeah.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.499
Well, I only been with one guy since,

26:35.500 --> 26:38.020
but we was high most of the time,
so I'm not sure that counts.

26:39.490 --> 26:41.030
You having trouble being with Wyatt?

26:41.400 --> 26:43.170
I just thought I was over it.

26:45.710 --> 26:47.760
I don't wanna be dealing
with this anymore.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.620
Girl, you ain't over it
till you're over it.

26:51.938 --> 26:53.280
You gotta get some help.

26:53.810 --> 26:55.600
And I don't think hiding out
from your boyfriend

26:55.610 --> 26:58.290
with a bunch a troublemakers
is where you're gonna find it.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.470
- Where is it?
- What?

27:01.988 --> 27:03.850
The stuff the guy left in the yard.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.530
Wait, Cole threw it out, right?

27:07.020 --> 27:08.900
I thought it was his hormones.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.249
Well, now you know it wasn't. So give it.

27:11.250 --> 27:12.309
I don't have it.

27:12.310 --> 27:13.990
- This ain't over.
- Get out.

27:25.100 --> 27:26.250
Where is Dev?

27:27.090 --> 27:28.240
I don't know.

27:29.390 --> 27:31.980
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

27:32.736 --> 27:35.669
Well, I came in because
I wanted to talk to you about Devonee.

27:35.670 --> 27:37.260
And then you went through my stuff? Nice.

27:37.290 --> 27:39.480
No, then I saw your backpack.

27:40.110 --> 27:42.070
Yeah, I know what running
away looks like, Cole.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.400
- I'm kinda good at it, remember?
- Fine.

27:45.173 --> 27:46.530
- We're leaving.
- Why?

27:46.740 --> 27:48.910
We have to. They're gonna
send me to a different home.

27:49.030 --> 27:50.720
So? I thought that's what you wanted.

27:52.710 --> 27:55.110
So, we wanna be together.

27:57.990 --> 28:00.279
She's just using you, Cole, for drugs.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.449
- She loves me.
- Devonee's not gay.

28:02.450 --> 28:03.650
Neither am I!

28:04.250 --> 28:07.509
OK, no. No, you're right.
I'm sorry, I get it. I do.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.119
That's why I have
to get out of this place,

28:09.120 --> 28:10.940
because no one here treats me like a man.

28:11.760 --> 28:15.280
OK, but they will at this new home, right?

28:16.130 --> 28:18.689
- The LGBT one?
- Yeah.

28:18.690 --> 28:22.630
They'll get you counseling,
doctors, hormones.

28:23.170 --> 28:25.440
Legal, safe hormones.

28:25.880 --> 28:28.029
If Devonee loves you,
if she really loves you,

28:28.030 --> 28:29.840
she will want you to go to this home.

28:30.130 --> 28:31.930
And she'll wait for you...

28:32.810 --> 28:37.030
... to become the man
you're supposed to be. Right?

28:39.690 --> 28:41.830
I guess maybe I was
a little jealous of Emma.

28:42.430 --> 28:43.229
You know, I saw you guys

28:43.230 --> 28:46.720
wrestling and I think I was...
I was just scared.

28:47.590 --> 28:50.580
That maybe you'd hook up
after the team dinner or something.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.634
You don't have to worry
about that. I'm with you.

28:52.664 --> 28:56.649
I know, but we sort
of started this with sex,

28:56.650 --> 29:00.880
and we haven't really even been on a date.

29:01.150 --> 29:03.510
That's why I wanted
to make dinner for you tonight.

29:03.540 --> 29:06.510
I just wanted to, like, impress you.

29:06.950 --> 29:08.750
But I already think you're awesome.

29:10.855 --> 29:12.330
I love how you make me feel.

29:12.670 --> 29:17.060
- Yeah? How's that?
- I don't know... safe.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.100
You take care of me.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.300
I like that.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.390
I like that, too.

29:25.630 --> 29:29.690
Maybe you could plan
a date for us tomorrow.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.160
I really have to study tomorrow.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.000
Right.

29:36.381 --> 29:40.560
Well, I ruined tonight,
so... I don't blame you.

29:41.740 --> 29:43.460
I guess I can study another night.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.770
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:49.270 --> 29:50.080
Sweet.

29:51.380 --> 29:54.960
Then let's plan something
really special, OK?

29:56.920 --> 30:00.700
- So what was in the bag? Coke? Crystal?
- Crystal.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.680
That bitch Callie stole it,
and I want it back.

30:05.575 --> 30:08.380
- I want my stuff!
- Well, I don't have it.

30:09.773 --> 30:10.590
I...

30:13.190 --> 30:15.030
I don't wanna leave tonight.

30:15.060 --> 30:16.368
- Because of her?
- No.

30:16.398 --> 30:18.630
Because I don't wanna be
on the streets again.

30:19.050 --> 30:20.806
And I wanna go to that home in Lemon Grove.

30:20.836 --> 30:23.960
- Why? So you can become a boy?
- Yeah.

30:24.140 --> 30:27.840
Well, let me tell you something.
You're never gonna be a boy,

30:28.130 --> 30:30.450
you're never gonna be nothing but a freak.

30:30.810 --> 30:32.489
What'd you think, that we were

30:32.490 --> 30:35.360
gonna run away together
and live happily ever after?

30:35.410 --> 30:37.149
I was just trying to get to Bakersfield,

30:37.150 --> 30:38.840
where my real boyfriend is, OK?

30:39.040 --> 30:41.730
- And I don't need you for that.
- Get out.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.356
- Oh, I'm going.
- And you best

30:44.386 --> 30:46.510
not to come back
'cause you ain't welcome here.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.978
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

30:49.008 --> 30:50.580
I'm leaving tonight,

30:51.628 --> 30:53.810
and y'all never gonna see me again.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.490
I hope ya'll light sleepers.

31:18.260 --> 31:20.620
- Hayley go home?
- Yeah.

31:21.140 --> 31:24.070
Hey, uh, so listen, you didn't
go to your team dinner?

31:25.200 --> 31:26.619
I wasn't eavesdropping.

31:26.620 --> 31:28.297
I was in the kitchen while
you were having dinner.

31:28.327 --> 31:31.550
- I still got the award.
- And you didn't go because...

31:31.722 --> 31:34.210
Hayley was really upset.
I needed to stay with her.

31:35.230 --> 31:38.929
Mm-hmm. Sounds a little like you were
being manipulated.

31:38.930 --> 31:41.075
But... just an observation.

31:41.105 --> 31:43.434
Well, you can keep
your observations to yourself.

31:43.464 --> 31:46.096
Excuse me? You don't have to get angry.

31:46.126 --> 31:47.430
I am angry.

31:48.215 --> 31:50.740
I really like her. She's really great.

31:50.770 --> 31:53.449
I'm sorry she's not Emma.
I know you loved Emma,

31:53.450 --> 31:56.397
but you don't have to like Hayley,
you're not the one dating her.

31:56.427 --> 31:58.329
OK. I just don't want to see

31:58.330 --> 32:00.770
you sacrificing things
that are important to you

32:01.186 --> 32:03.286
in order to take care of a girl.

32:03.362 --> 32:07.190
Well, I'm not. OK? Are we done?

32:07.960 --> 32:08.680
Yes.

32:34.740 --> 32:36.050
I'm really sorry.

32:38.111 --> 32:41.459
I'm so stupid. I could have
blown everything.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.440
But you didn't.

32:45.568 --> 32:47.320
Will anyone ever love me?

32:48.540 --> 32:49.220
I do.

32:51.050 --> 32:52.600
You know what I mean.

32:53.770 --> 32:56.030
Will anyone ever love a freak?

32:56.640 --> 32:57.920
You're not a freak.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.240
You just know who you are.

33:01.430 --> 33:04.869
And you have the courage to go through

33:04.870 --> 33:06.170
with what you have to

33:07.250 --> 33:09.520
to, you know, make yourself
the person you wanna be.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.300
That's more than a lot of us can say.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.640
You're not the person you wanna be?

33:17.100 --> 33:18.500
I'm working on it.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.950
You want me to stay in here tonight?

33:25.770 --> 33:28.130
No, we have to act like
we don't know she's gone.

33:29.403 --> 33:31.850
OK. Try to get some sleep, yeah?

33:43.113 --> 33:45.450
- Hey, sorry.
- It's all right.

33:48.090 --> 33:52.840
Are you OK? You seemed
kind of... quiet at group.

33:53.170 --> 33:55.250
Yeah. No, I'm just tired.

34:05.220 --> 34:06.290
I gotta pee.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.070
Out of the house!

36:23.180 --> 36:25.130
Down the front stairs! Out of the house!

36:25.760 --> 36:26.780
Where's Becka?

36:26.790 --> 36:28.800
- Uh, bathroom?
- I'll get her. Callie, get out!

36:29.224 --> 36:32.879
- Where's Devonee, Cole?
- She's not here, she ran away.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.079
- Are you sure?
- Yes, 100 percent!

36:34.109 --> 36:35.579
Get everybody outside!

36:35.580 --> 36:37.830
Becka! Becka!

36:41.560 --> 36:43.709
- What do we do?
- Go next door and call 911.

36:43.710 --> 36:45.390
- OK!
- Did you find her?

36:45.400 --> 36:46.899
- No. I looked everywhere.
- Basement.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.470
- Girls go down to smoke.
- Get everybody outside now!

36:49.730 --> 36:50.820
Becka!

36:52.200 --> 36:52.910
Becka!

36:59.280 --> 37:00.040
Becka!

37:02.010 --> 37:03.710
Becka! Honey, wake up!

37:03.970 --> 37:05.540
Becka!

37:31.080 --> 37:31.910
Callie!

37:34.300 --> 37:36.130
Come on, we can get her! Come on!

37:43.370 --> 37:46.310
Callie! Get out now! Go!

37:49.390 --> 37:51.410
God, I can't believe this is happening!

37:51.510 --> 37:53.820
- What the hell's going on?
- Like you don't know!

37:53.830 --> 37:56.390
- Did you do this?!
- Kiara, come on. Come on.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.910
There's two people in there!
In the basement!

38:00.890 --> 38:01.800
We've got her.

38:01.810 --> 38:02.760
Clear away.

38:04.410 --> 38:05.410
I got her.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.380
Clear away, girls!
Let them do their job.

38:14.670 --> 38:16.930
It's OK. Here.

38:17.370 --> 38:20.450
We got her. Set her down easy.
There you go.

38:22.720 --> 38:25.050
- She's gonna be OK. Yeah.
- Ready to move.

38:34.590 --> 38:36.800
What was doing
in the basement in the first place?

38:37.290 --> 38:39.360
Duh. She was setting the place on fire.

38:39.630 --> 38:42.450
- Why?
- Maybe she was trying to kill herself.

38:42.510 --> 38:43.830
And all of us with her?

38:45.390 --> 38:46.780
She took the drugs.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.479
- What?
- She's the one who took the drugs.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.110
She was down there getting high.

38:51.220 --> 38:54.074
But she was doin' so good.
She was goin' home.

38:54.104 --> 38:56.949
She was pretty upset,
after she saw her mom.

38:56.950 --> 38:59.460
- Maybe something happened.
- What...?

38:59.500 --> 39:02.763
OK. Becka's being treated
for smoke inhalation,

39:02.793 --> 39:04.670
but they say that she's gonna be fine.

39:05.210 --> 39:08.141
Also I spoke to the fire chief
and he said you can go.

39:08.171 --> 39:11.109
Just be quick about it.
Get your stuff and then come back

39:11.110 --> 39:13.050
because your PO's are on the way here.

39:13.490 --> 39:14.570
Where we gonna go?

39:16.457 --> 39:19.170
- Back to juvie.
- What?

39:20.810 --> 39:24.020
I'm sorry, OK? Just until they can
find you another group home.

39:24.430 --> 39:25.930
All right? Oh.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.070
Well, I guess he's gonna
get his wish, right?

39:29.210 --> 39:31.520
There's no way the landlord's
gonna let us stay now.

39:32.010 --> 39:34.779
It's my fault. I should have...

39:34.780 --> 39:38.190
Listen, Cole, at this point,
the less I know the better.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.260
Now, all of you, go get your stuff, please.

39:43.230 --> 39:46.199
Callie, could I speak
to you for a minute? Please?

39:46.531 --> 39:49.322
OK. Bye. Just let me know
where you are, OK?

39:49.352 --> 39:50.701
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

39:51.800 --> 39:55.140
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

39:59.108 --> 40:01.580
You should not have gone
into that basement, Callie.

40:01.780 --> 40:03.230
Neither should you.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.780
OK, well, maybe I don't have
a right to talk, but you know what?

40:07.610 --> 40:10.930
That's how people get killed,
trying to be heroes.

40:11.810 --> 40:15.320
Do not ever, ever do anything
like that again.

40:18.620 --> 40:19.670
So is that...

40:22.340 --> 40:23.870
So is this the end of...?

40:25.751 --> 40:26.901
I don't know.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.280
But whatever it is, you'll be OK.

40:31.056 --> 40:32.570
What about the rest of them?

40:33.920 --> 40:36.140
They have the same choice that you had.

40:36.920 --> 40:37.980
To get it together.

40:38.900 --> 40:42.530
You know, you are
a success story, Callie. You are.

40:42.970 --> 40:45.010
You're not perfect, but who is?

40:45.740 --> 40:48.020
You really are doing great, honey.

40:48.250 --> 40:49.540
Do not quit now.

40:51.140 --> 40:51.930
Callie!

40:59.680 --> 41:00.573
Callie, are you OK?
