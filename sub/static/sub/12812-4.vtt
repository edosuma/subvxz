was here? Tonight?

30:48.310 --> 30:51.973
He's the one who put
the doped up tequila
on the doorstep.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.279
He even signed
his name to the card.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.239
Look, if Emma says that someone
wearing a Brandon James mask
attacked her,

30:59.250 --> 31:02.287
then someone wearing
a Brandon James mask
attacked her!

31:02.290 --> 31:04.485
Really? Any idea who?

31:04.490 --> 31:06.048
Maybe you Should ask your son!

31:06.060 --> 31:09.996
He's the one who seems to enjoy
drawing her covered in blood.

31:15.340 --> 31:16.864
Dad?

31:19.270 --> 31:20.828
(SIGHS)

31:20.840 --> 31:22.979
I want you to have this.

31:24.450 --> 31:28.307
To remind you
that I wasn't always
a bad father.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.311
I really just want to help you.
I'm just-- I'm just--

31:30.320 --> 31:37.089
I'm a little too messed up,
so... I'm gonna go away
for a while.

31:38.390 --> 31:40.551
I'm gonna get some help.

31:42.430 --> 31:45.092
Yeah, I think
that's a good idea.

31:45.100 --> 31:48.422
Maybe this time
it'll stick, right?

31:50.570 --> 31:52.231
In the woods...

31:52.910 --> 31:55.003
you really didn't
see anything?

31:55.010 --> 31:58.036
No, just you...

31:58.050 --> 31:59.335
...in trouble.

(DOOR CLOSES)

32:05.450 --> 32:07.042
What happened?

32:08.420 --> 32:11.355
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

32:11.360 --> 32:15.126
Sheriff Acosta said
you were attacked.
Mm-hmm.

32:15.130 --> 32:18.122
Are you okay?
Yes.

32:18.970 --> 32:24.465
Were you here for all of this?
I thought I told you I didn't
want you in the house.

32:24.470 --> 32:27.064
Mom, Dad saved me tonight.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.334
Just in time_
to play the saVIor.
How convenient.

32:29.340 --> 32:32.332
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.

32:32.350 --> 32:36.616
Mom, what does that mean?
Nothing.

32:39.950 --> 32:41.247
(KNOCKS)

32:41.620 --> 32:44.180
I didn't do anything.
I didn't have anything to do

32:44.190 --> 32:45.384
with what happened tonight.

32:45.390 --> 32:48.154
I trust you. It's Okay.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.628
Trash still needs
to go out, though.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.019
Okay.

Mrs. Fitzgerald,
thanks for getting back to me.

33:28.170 --> 33:29.421
Yeah.

33:33.410 --> 33:36.231
You might want to cut
your vacation short.

33:38.210 --> 33:41.077
I believe your son's missing.

33:52.460 --> 33:55.054
You sure you're doing okay?

33:56.560 --> 33:58.357
I know what I saw.

34:01.140 --> 34:05.236
You believe me... right?

34:08.080 --> 34:12.733
You've been
so stressed out, lately...

34:13.480 --> 34:18.474
about seeing stuff
that wasn't there...

34:19.550 --> 34:22.144
crap with your dad...

34:24.160 --> 34:27.357
I'm just worried that...

34:27.360 --> 34:28.827
I mean...

34:29.630 --> 34:32.428
Maybe you were right before.

34:34.270 --> 34:37.797
Maybe you weren't ready
to come baCk yet.

34:40.370 --> 34:44.773
Going back
to that treatment facility
wouldn't change anything.

34:46.650 --> 34:49.448
Mm.
You were right.

34:50.350 --> 34:55.310
Everything I need to fix
is right here.

35:19.510 --> 35:20.499
Hey.

35:20.510 --> 35:21.772
Hey.

35:21.780 --> 35:24.476
Last night
was really weird, huh?

35:24.490 --> 35:26.640
Yeah. Don't do drugs, kids.

35:26.650 --> 35:28.186
Right?

35:30.790 --> 35:32.257
Um...

35:32.790 --> 35:33.859
One question...

35:33.860 --> 35:39.298
Right before we, uh...
you know, kissed...

35:39.700 --> 35:41.167
why did you apologize to me?

35:41.170 --> 35:42.762
Apologize?
Don't remember doing that.

35:42.770 --> 35:47.662
Must have been the drugs.
It was all about the drugs.

35:48.310 --> 35:55.648
But probably not for her.
She likes you. I can tell.
Try not to blow it, okay?

36:03.390 --> 36:06.780
WOMA/V:
Tell me,
why does my heart burn

36:06.790 --> 36:08.587
When I see your face...

36:08.600 --> 36:12.798
So, last night
was really weird, huh?

36:12.800 --> 36:15.689
Yeah. What was that?

36:15.700 --> 36:20.535
I mean, I know what it was,
but what happened?

36:20.540 --> 36:23.907
I'm not completely sure.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.507
Did you like it?

36:30.680 --> 36:34.343
Yeah, uh, I think I did.

36:34.350 --> 36:35.339
What about Audrey?

36:35.360 --> 36:38.887
Seemed pretty tense
when you were talking
over there with her.

36:38.890 --> 36:42.348
Oh! Yeah, I don't know.
It's, um...

36:42.360 --> 36:44.499
It's hard to tell
with her sometimes.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.718
So, what now?
Do we have, like,

36:46.730 --> 36:48.220
a threesome going,
or something?

36:48.240 --> 36:51.437
I don't know about that,
but, um...

36:51.440 --> 36:54.238
maybe we could go out
again sometime?

36:54.240 --> 36:56.299
Just you and me.
(CHUCKLES)

36:56.640 --> 36:59.507
Is it because Audrey
turned you down?

37:00.610 --> 37:02.407
It's because I like you.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.719
You like your gay
best friend too, right?

37:06.250 --> 37:11.711
I just don't see it adding up
to happiness, for any of us.

37:12.360 --> 37:13.850
I'm sorry.

37:27.710 --> 37:28.938
Hey.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.273
Hey.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.247
I, um...

37:33.250 --> 37:35.468
I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry

37:35.480 --> 37:37.744
for freaking out
on you last night.

37:37.750 --> 37:40.913
You were... actually
a really good guide.

37:40.920 --> 37:44.310
I would have_ been
totally screwed wrthout you.

37:44.320 --> 37:46.754
Yeah, it got pretty intense.

37:48.000 --> 37:48.819
Yeah.

37:48.830 --> 37:54.268
Maybe we should hang out
again... sometime.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.490
Maybe.

38:00.710 --> 38:02.701
Cool.

38:03.710 --> 38:05.405
Cool.

38:05.410 --> 38:09.972
I can't believe I have
to be in this freaking
Lady of the Lake assembly.

38:09.980 --> 38:13.984

After, uh... After, you know,
hallucinating all night.

38:13.990 --> 38:19.348
(CHUCKLES)
Well, if anyone can
handle it, it's you.

38:21.830 --> 38:23.627
I'll see ya.

38:32.610 --> 38:35.864
Emma, hey.
Whatever it is,
I am not interested.

38:35.880 --> 38:40.704
Okay, that's fair,
but I want to apologize
for last night anyway.

38:40.710 --> 38:43.440
Which part of it?
All of it, Okay?

38:43.450 --> 38:45.816
The party, what happened
in the kitchen...

38:45.820 --> 38:47.685
Nothing happened
in the kitchen.

38:47.690 --> 38:49.885
Look, you must
be freaked out

38:49.890 --> 38:51.551
after what happened
in the woods.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.585
That sheriff doesn't
get it, okay?

38:53.590 --> 38:55.979
I could tell
from his questions.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.627
I have to go
to the assembly.
I...

38:59.630 --> 39:03.669
I want you to know
that there's no doubt
in my mind.

39:03.670 --> 39:07.367
I believe you,
even if Kieran doesn't.

39:07.370 --> 39:09.531
Why are you telling me this?
I'm trying to help.

39:09.540 --> 39:11.371
Telling me what
you think I want to hear

39:11.380 --> 39:12.779
does not mean
that you're helping.

39:12.780 --> 39:14.873
It means that you
do not get it at all.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.006
Okay, I'm not trying--

39:16.020 --> 39:19.774
If what I saw last night
in the woods was real,

39:19.790 --> 39:22.418
there is a new killer
out there,

39:22.420 --> 39:26.652
_ and all of that
IS happening again.

39:29.930 --> 39:33.696
And that's why it gives me
great pleasure to announce

39:33.700 --> 39:35.964
the five finalists
that will compete

39:35.970 --> 39:39.030

please come to the stage.

39:56.690 --> 39:58.954
Where have you been?
You almost missed it.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.951
