WEBVTT

00:10.440 --> 00:14.160
Silvana Saguto, the former president
of the preventive measures department

00:14.240 --> 00:17.880
of the Court of Palermo,
has been removed from the judiciary.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.240
No mitigation
for the former president.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.560
The Superior Council of the Judiciary

00:24.640 --> 00:27.920
has given Silvana Saguto
its highest disciplinary sanction,

00:28.000 --> 00:29.840
expulsion from the judiciary.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.080
The Council has expelled me
from the judiciary,

00:40.160 --> 00:43.560
not just before my trial,
but without even hearing me!

00:44.440 --> 00:46.360
That's never happened before in Italy.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.000
JUSTICE

00:51.320 --> 00:55.760
I never thought that my colleagues
would have believed what Maniaci started.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.960
I never thought
that my career would end like this.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.240
I expected that it would end

01:05.760 --> 01:08.240
at the hands of the Mafia,
that they'd blow me up.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.800
I never thought that I'd end up on trial.

01:18.680 --> 01:22.200
How can someone
accused of extortion be credible?

01:31.080 --> 01:33.040
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

02:01.640 --> 02:03.080
Assignments, favors,

02:03.160 --> 02:05.720
confidential information,
engagements, and gifts

02:05.800 --> 02:09.160
in the offices of the preventive measures
department of the Court of Palermo.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.480
Investigators
are examining material from the inquiry

02:14.560 --> 02:16.800
that is shaking up the system
that manages fortunes

02:16.880 --> 02:18.720
seized from organized crime.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.960
With the documents
and telephone recordings,

02:21.040 --> 02:24.800
the judges already have enough material
to try to back up the allegations.

02:33.680 --> 02:37.560
I'm still completely shocked
and surprised by this trial.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.920
There are 39 charges.

02:42.560 --> 02:47.120
Among them, for example,
is one for criminal association,

02:48.200 --> 02:50.520
allegedly, between me, my husband,

02:50.600 --> 02:53.120
and a high-up judicial administrator.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.320
The other very serious charge
is corruption.

03:00.280 --> 03:04.280
This administrator,
supposedly, gave us €20,000.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.880
I manage billions, and I take €20,000?

03:09.960 --> 03:12.440
That adds up to
a few paychecks for a judge,

03:12.960 --> 03:15.040
which is really… it's ridiculous.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.000
Among the many absurd charges,

03:20.920 --> 03:23.200
there is one that's completely ridiculous.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.760
I've been accused
of owning firearms without a license.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.800
Now, like any other judge…

03:35.840 --> 03:39.080
I have permission to carry firearms
because of my job,

03:39.160 --> 03:40.360
because I am a judge.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.160
I have my card here.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.800
And on the back, it says,

03:48.880 --> 03:51.720
"Valid for carrying firearms
without a license."

03:53.960 --> 03:55.680
I could even carry a bazooka,

03:56.200 --> 03:57.760
because all judges can.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.840
What bothers me the most
was that to get to me,

04:03.920 --> 04:06.000
they also incriminated my family.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.240
My husband was accused

04:10.320 --> 04:12.960
because the administrator
gave him contracts.

04:16.120 --> 04:19.800
Just a few people managed
the seized assets from the Mafia

04:19.880 --> 04:21.720
for wildly inflated fees.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.840
The judges in Caltanissetta
are investigating Silvana Saguto,

04:26.920 --> 04:30.080
as well as her husband,
and one of the top judicial administrators

04:30.160 --> 04:31.440
in all of Italy.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.600
At the center of investigation
is the exchange of favors.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.480
SILVANA SAGUTO'S HUSBAND
IS A TECHNICAL CONSULTANT

04:40.560 --> 04:42.880
WHO EVALUATED THE MAFIA ASSETS

04:42.960 --> 04:45.840
SEIZED BY
THE PREVENTIVE MEASURES DEPARTMENT

04:49.680 --> 04:52.320
I've been accused of not carrying out

04:52.400 --> 04:54.040
the work I was paid for,

04:55.240 --> 04:59.560
of being paid more than…
erm… I should have been.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.880
Of course, I feel completely betrayed.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.560
It's deeply disappointing.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.120
Hi, Dad.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.600
-Hi.
-Come in.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.600
-How are you?
-Good, you?

05:14.120 --> 05:15.000
Not bad.

05:15.880 --> 05:21.040
What made me really angry
was involving my parents.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.800
My dad, who is 91 years old,

05:23.880 --> 05:28.520
was accused of money laundering
for giving me €15,000.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.760
When you're 90,

05:31.840 --> 05:34.200
it's already hard to understand,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.480
but I don't think he even knows
what "money laundering" means.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.360
He gave me some of his money,

05:43.680 --> 05:45.600
like he's done all my life.

05:48.440 --> 05:53.400
There's no logic. And if there's no logic,
it means there's something behind it.

06:08.200 --> 06:12.120
Amongst the people Pino Maniaci is helping
is the Cavalotti family.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.680
The Cavallotti family are entrepreneurs
from Belmonte Mezzagno,

06:18.760 --> 06:22.000
which is a town
with a very high Mafia population.

06:23.240 --> 06:27.680
The Cavallotti family couldn't have built
their fortune through legal means.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.680
They had millions of euros
of discrepancies.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.280
They couldn't prove where it came from.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.440
They're a bunch of dishonest people.

06:40.760 --> 06:44.400
CAVALLOTTI FAMILY'S VILLAS

06:52.120 --> 06:55.120
We were the first entrepreneurs,
in Sicily and in Italy,

06:55.200 --> 06:56.560
to supply methane to towns

06:56.640 --> 07:00.240
that didn't get state funding
for setting up a methane supply system.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.480
WARNING
FLAMMABLE GAS

07:04.920 --> 07:08.320
We had a turnover
of around 20 billion liras per year,

07:08.400 --> 07:10.680
that would be €12 million today,

07:10.760 --> 07:11.760
for the whole group.

07:13.680 --> 07:17.160
We saw that we could supply methane
with little money.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.400
With our funds

07:20.480 --> 07:22.440
and a small loan from the banks.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.280
Mayors called us every day.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.360
We basically already had…
more than 100 towns,

07:31.880 --> 07:32.920
in Sicily.

07:34.840 --> 07:37.200
We annoyed very important people.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.840
The real Mafia
are those wearing white collars.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.480
They are the ones who destroyed us.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.960
It was all built
on everything that Saguto did,

07:51.560 --> 07:53.080
if we're naming names.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.720
Before we got a verdict from this judge,

07:57.640 --> 07:59.440
she sold our businesses.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.520
But we'll be back.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.040
We'll fight the courts as long as we live

08:08.120 --> 08:10.200
to get our things back, legally.

08:11.360 --> 08:16.440
THE CAVALLOTTI FAMILY ARE CAMPAIGNING
TO CHANGE THE LAW ON PREVENTIVE MEASURES

08:18.960 --> 08:21.520
Attention,
citizens of Belmonte.

08:23.320 --> 08:26.760
We ask that you sign
the eight proposals to change the law.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.400
This is a people's initiative
against the system.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.040
Sign for a fairer legal system.

08:35.560 --> 08:40.000
We'll be at Coffice
from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.120
and from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.

08:44.160 --> 08:45.960
Citizens of Belmonte…

08:48.920 --> 08:51.280
A country
which has preventive measures

08:52.320 --> 08:53.760
cannot be a free country.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.560
This is an issue
that hasn't just affected one family,

08:59.640 --> 09:01.400
it's hit the economy of a whole town.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.880
Shit. They're stuck together. Wait.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.240
This is why we support the fight

09:09.320 --> 09:11.960
for a reform
of the preventive measures system.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.960
For freedom and against the system.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.600
You worked for Euro Impianti.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.840
If you could kindly sign,
it won't hurt you.

09:24.280 --> 09:27.840
We're collecting signatures
towards setting a clear definition

09:27.920 --> 09:30.680
of when preventive measures
can be enforced.

09:32.680 --> 09:36.800
We want to change the concept
of "participating in a Mafia group."

09:40.160 --> 09:41.640
Can you see all the people signing?

09:41.720 --> 09:44.480
-When people understand, they sign.
-Sure, sure.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.280
What's happened to us
can happen to anyone.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.200
The Cavallotti case

09:56.280 --> 09:58.160
symbolizes all the seizures.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.360
We can say
that it's the mother of all seizures.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.680
If this seizure falls,
preventive measures falls.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.120
Saguto's system would crumble.

10:20.760 --> 10:24.080
I don't know why Maniaci
has joined the Cavallotti cause.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.680
I know that Maniaci doesn't do
anything for nothing.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.760
Someone has used him.

10:34.080 --> 10:38.160
The Mafia has benefited most
from all of this, from my trial.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.560
A journalist came to me,
almost mocking me, saying,

10:44.360 --> 10:49.040
"You know, now you've left,
nothing has been seized. Nothing."

10:50.560 --> 10:52.520
Of course, the Mafia is thankful.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.440
Pino!

10:53.520 --> 10:56.880
-Hello, how's it going?
-You're as kind as always.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.960
MARCH 2018

11:13.600 --> 11:16.800
That's enough, Chira. That's enough!

11:20.760 --> 11:22.040
When I found out

11:22.120 --> 11:25.240
that my dad was being tried for extortion,

11:25.920 --> 11:28.800
my world fell around me.
I said, "No, it can't be true."

11:31.880 --> 11:35.920
-Have we got any small plates?
-You have to get the candles too.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.400
-Put on the candles!
-You should put cigarettes.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.400
Next year, we'll do that!

12:03.200 --> 12:05.880
-Bravo!
-We can do it, that's enough.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.920
Yay!

12:09.000 --> 12:11.040
I'm still young, damn it!

12:11.560 --> 12:13.400
Take ten years off me.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.000
I'll take more
than ten years off of you.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.960
My dad pretends to be fine,

12:22.880 --> 12:27.520
but in reality
this whole situation has shaken him up.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.160
Not knowing how the trial will end,

12:33.080 --> 12:34.440
we're all worried.

12:40.080 --> 12:43.560
APRIL 2018

12:48.360 --> 12:52.240
Today is an important day for…
for Pino Maniaci's trial.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.760
The former Mayor of Borgetto

12:57.840 --> 13:02.240
wants to destroy the Telejato station
with these extortion allegations,

13:02.320 --> 13:03.800
and get it closed down.

13:21.360 --> 13:25.240
No one has ever seen
an extortion of €366 before.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.200
However, it's still a serious charge,

13:30.280 --> 13:33.160
because extortion
is a typical Mafia crime.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.600
The punishment is a serious sentence,
from five to ten years.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.120
It's not a joke.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.560
Ending up in prison
convicted for extortion

13:46.640 --> 13:49.160
would be the end of Pino Maniaci
and Telejato.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.000
People feel
like they've lost faith in the judiciary…

13:57.080 --> 13:58.600
MANIACI TRIAL

13:58.680 --> 14:01.480
EXTORTION CHARGE
WITNESS: DE LUCA

14:02.080 --> 14:02.960
Hello.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.920
Morning, Your Honor.
Morning, Public Prosecutor.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.680
Let's begin the hearing.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.480
Giuseppe Maniaci here present,
defended by his lawyer, Mr. Parrino.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.280
For the civil parties, Gioacchino De Luca.

14:19.440 --> 14:23.520
"With my testimony, I accept to uphold
my moral and legal duty.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.320
I swear to tell the whole truth

14:25.400 --> 14:28.000
and not to hide any facts
that I am aware of."

14:28.080 --> 14:29.360
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR

14:31.520 --> 14:35.000
-Go ahead.
-Mr. De Luca, let's start.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.000
Did you give money to Pino Maniaci?

14:38.680 --> 14:39.560
Yes.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.920
A lot.
I gave him money on several occasions

14:44.000 --> 14:46.920
because he would broadcast
bulletins on the news.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.720
-What did he do on the bulletins?
-Attacked me.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.400
He attacked the administration.

14:56.880 --> 15:00.480
So, following these reports
that he presented on the news program,

15:00.560 --> 15:01.800
what did he ask of you?

15:06.000 --> 15:10.200
He asked me for money
to give me the opportunity to respond.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.680
Because at that time, at 2:15 pm,

15:12.760 --> 15:14.480
an anti-Mafia TV channel

15:14.560 --> 15:18.480
that a lot of people watched,
my son, my father, my wife,

15:19.680 --> 15:23.160
it was fertile ground
to spread biased and fake news.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.960
And he attacked us.

15:26.920 --> 15:27.800
JANUARY 2016

15:27.880 --> 15:29.440
This Mayor is not fit

15:29.520 --> 15:32.560
to run the town of Borgetto at all.

15:34.400 --> 15:38.280
The soap opera of Borgetto's Mayor,
De Luca, continues.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.680
NOVEMBER 2015

15:40.760 --> 15:42.160
Absolute silence

15:42.240 --> 15:43.920
from the Borgetto Council

15:44.000 --> 15:46.080
about the demolition of a school.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.280
Because Pino Maniaci
makes a certain type of television,

15:52.880 --> 15:54.120
where he tells lies,

15:54.200 --> 15:57.800
he's starting to broadcast
negative stories about administrators.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.720
If you wanna respond,

15:59.800 --> 16:02.120
you have to pay
to respond to the accusations

16:02.200 --> 16:04.400
and the things
that Pino Maniaci is saying.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.280
It's a small amount of money,
but it's constant,

16:07.360 --> 16:11.400
every week, every month,
every mayor, and every administrator.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.040
It was protection money
for all intents and purposes.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.640
It was extortion
for all intents and purposes.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.160
Argh, that's Maniaci's system.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.760
COURT OF LAW

16:30.240 --> 16:32.800
If you didn't give him money,
would he threaten you?

16:33.320 --> 16:34.600
-Yes.
-How so?

16:36.040 --> 16:38.080
There were lots of things that he said.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.200
There was nothing I could do

16:41.280 --> 16:44.200
because he had a strong position,
he was powerful.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.040
He was someone you couldn't attack,
irreproachable,

16:48.120 --> 16:50.520
he's an anti-Mafia leader like no other.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.400
I am completely outraged and disgusted

16:54.480 --> 16:58.000
about everything
that's happening to me and my family.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.360
I don't mean "family"
as Pino Maniaci would

17:00.440 --> 17:03.800
because as soon as you say "family,"
you mean it's the Mafia family!

17:05.640 --> 17:08.560
Because he didn't know
what to say, what to make up

17:08.640 --> 17:10.520
to try and extort money from me.

17:10.600 --> 17:13.480
Since I met the prosecutor,
I have shaken off Pino Maniaci

17:13.560 --> 17:17.320
and everything he represents,
which isn't the anti-Mafia.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.080
How much money
did you give to Pino Maniaci

17:22.680 --> 17:24.320
to tone down the news bulletins?

17:24.400 --> 17:29.960
The amountvaried, let's say 200,
300 euros. That's around the amount.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.840
And how much money
did he ask you for this instance?

17:32.920 --> 17:35.000
He asked me for €366.

17:37.400 --> 17:41.720
I remember it well
because he reminded me a million times!

17:42.240 --> 17:44.600
Three sixty-six plus 100,
that was the amount.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.960
I asked for what was mine.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.280
His wife was advertising

17:52.360 --> 17:54.320
her toy shop on Telejato,

17:54.400 --> 17:55.880
and he was paying for it.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.360
That's it. End of story.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.920
It was a commercial

18:01.000 --> 18:05.960
that… went on air, all viewers
could see it on every newscast.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.480
Can you explain to everyone, Mr. Mayor,

18:09.560 --> 18:11.720
what this commercial is? Let's see it.

18:13.360 --> 18:17.040
Toys and Paper Borgetto
has all the new releases for you.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.240
With a wide range of gadgets,
purses, and perfumes,

18:20.320 --> 18:25.120
bicycles, baby walkers, tractors, and cars
to make your children happy.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.840
Find us in Borgetto,
at via Piersanti Mattarella 38,

18:28.920 --> 18:30.480
in front of Villa Comunale.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.800
This was broadcast for free for you.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.360
The payment for the commercial
to be broadcast for the Mayor of Borgetto.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.840
For anyone who has a commercial with us,

18:44.920 --> 18:49.600
knows that our budget is €300
plus VAT per month,

18:50.360 --> 18:52.320
€366.

18:59.480 --> 19:02.680
Mr. Maniaci invited me
to do a commercial on his TV station.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.160
I'm a public figure.
He's the head of Telejato,

19:07.680 --> 19:10.360
so you'd need a contract and an invoice.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.240
There are no invoices and no contracts,

19:14.320 --> 19:16.360
and I asked him millions of times.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.480
They're not there.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.680
So you didn't give him money
for the commercial on this occasion…

19:21.760 --> 19:22.800
Absolutely not!

19:24.320 --> 19:27.400
I see.
Your Honor, I have no further questions.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.400
Defense, go ahead.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.040
Good morning, Mr. De Luca.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.680
I'm Mr. Parrino,
Mr. Maniaci's defense counsel.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.160
Good morning.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.320
So…

19:45.920 --> 19:50.120
Listen, you said that you had
a commercial with Pino Maniaci.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.280
Is that right?

19:55.880 --> 19:56.920
What he would do

19:57.520 --> 20:00.240
is make me pay two
or three months in advance

20:01.200 --> 20:02.360
because he needed money.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.800
When he was supposed to stop showing
the damn commercial, he didn't stop.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.200
So, did you say to Pino Maniaci,

20:13.280 --> 20:16.680
"Enough. I don't want more dealings
with you for the commercials"?

20:16.760 --> 20:21.440
Of course. I said to him, "Look, I paid
for the commercial for these months.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.200
No need to show it anymore,"
and he carried on anyway,

20:24.280 --> 20:25.560
showing the commercial.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.560
And why didn't you report him before?

20:38.840 --> 20:41.120
I couldn't counterattack
an anti-Mafia figure

20:41.200 --> 20:43.040
with connections everywhere.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.920
Challenging him, reporting him

20:45.000 --> 20:47.360
would have had
a terrible reaction in the media.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.480
How could I defend myself?

21:00.760 --> 21:03.400
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.520
Very well.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.040
This trial is a sham.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.160
Pino Maniaci's crime

21:23.000 --> 21:26.440
was targeting
the preventive measures department

21:26.960 --> 21:28.520
of the Court of Palermo.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.440
They wanted to screw with me,
so they had to find something on me.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.000
They used De Luca

21:40.080 --> 21:42.040
because of the money, which…

21:43.520 --> 21:47.560
which they could use,
or better twist, in their favor.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.320
EXCEPT TELEJATO

21:49.400 --> 21:52.000
Look, this TV station has its own path.

21:52.720 --> 21:53.960
It always has.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.520
Fight the Mafia, no ifs, no buts.

21:59.640 --> 22:04.240
Of course, they all claim to be victims
of… of my… of my attacks.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.240
We have reason to believe

22:13.600 --> 22:16.360
that the Borgetto Council has powerful…

22:16.440 --> 22:17.400
MARCH 2014

22:18.560 --> 22:19.680
…figures…

22:21.040 --> 22:22.480
in its administration.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.720
Powerful figures… in its administration.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.280
Hi.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.200
De Luca
is an unreliable individual.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.800
He has to respond to very serious crimes

22:43.880 --> 22:47.400
because within his administration,
we found out

22:47.480 --> 22:51.800
that there were
some very shady characters… who were…

22:52.760 --> 22:54.720
well known in Borgetto

22:54.800 --> 22:58.880
and who had connections
to the local Mafia.

23:01.120 --> 23:07.000
I think that the whole operation
in Borgetto is… ironically,

23:08.040 --> 23:09.640
because of our reports.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.640
Welcome to today's Telejato News.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.600
AUGUST 2014

23:16.120 --> 23:20.080
There's been a lot of controversy
around the Mayor's visit to America,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.560
and certain meetings.

23:38.040 --> 23:41.240
IN 2014 MAYOR DE LUCA LED
A PARTY OF BORGETTO COUNSELORS

23:41.320 --> 23:44.120
AND SOME PRIVATE CITIZENS
ON A TRIP TO NEW YORK

23:45.360 --> 23:48.240
THEY TOOK
BORGETTO'S HOLY MADONNA WITH THEM

23:48.320 --> 23:51.360
TO SHOW HER
TO THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION OF THE CITY

23:58.160 --> 24:02.360
It was the community's dream
for the Madonna to come here to New York.

24:04.040 --> 24:07.040
Since the start,
we've been welcomed with open arms.

24:07.560 --> 24:10.600
It's been a wonderful success.
It'll go in the history books.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.600
This whole thing is a joke.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.360
In America, the Madonna

24:26.440 --> 24:28.920
was received by a Mafia big shot.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.520
So, this is when they arrived.

24:36.480 --> 24:40.760
There was a Mafia presence
welcoming the Borgetto delegation.

24:42.720 --> 24:47.400
This is One-handed Frank,
unmistakable because he's lost a hand.

24:49.480 --> 24:52.920
He's a high-ranking mafioso
originally from Borgetto,

24:54.280 --> 24:58.200
who moved to America to flee
the arrest warrants out for him.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.080
FRANCESCO RAPPA WAS BORN IN SICILY IN 1935

25:06.160 --> 25:08.960
AND IS WANTED
IN ITALY FOR MAFIA ASSOCIATION

25:10.880 --> 25:13.480
This individual
is always in the foreground.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.640
He's always close to the Council members.

25:18.080 --> 25:21.640
And as you can see, the Mayor
is close too, just two steps away.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.320
Here, he's in front of him.
Can you see where he is?

25:26.240 --> 25:28.120
He's in front of the Mayor now.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.080
He's always close to them.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.600
-Hello.
-Hi, Gioacchino. How are you?

26:02.680 --> 26:03.840
Great, great.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.520
-How is your family?
-Everything's fine.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.480
The kids are at school.
It's the same old, but it's fine.

26:12.760 --> 26:13.720
Want some coffee?

26:14.440 --> 26:17.600
Yes, yes, I'll have some, I'll have some.
I'll have some coffee.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.720
FORMER PRESS OFFICER - BORGETTO

26:21.640 --> 26:24.800
I was the spokesperson
for De Luca's administration.

26:25.560 --> 26:30.280
I have a real friendship with Gioacchino.
We created a project together

26:30.920 --> 26:33.360
to create positive things for the town.

26:34.920 --> 26:38.120
GIUSEPPE PANETTINO
IS A PROSECUTION WITNESS

26:38.200 --> 26:40.600
IN PINO MANIACI'S TRIAL

26:43.400 --> 26:44.720
I feel really disappointed

26:44.800 --> 26:47.160
about all the negative things
we experienced.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.960
With the administration,

26:51.040 --> 26:54.680
Gioacchino was invited
by the Borgetto expatriates in America.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.960
He agreed to take
the Holy Madonna del Romitello to them.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.640
Pino Maniaci didn't hesitate
to ruin the event,

27:04.720 --> 27:07.160
to discredit the administration,
the Americans,

27:07.240 --> 27:09.160
the people from Borgetto in general.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.200
This made me really angry.

27:14.040 --> 27:17.760
They did everything they could
to make it look like some Mafia thing.

27:22.840 --> 27:26.320
Obviously, the Mayor wanted
to defend himself against the claims

27:26.400 --> 27:28.560
made about the meetings in America.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.000
AUGUST 2014

27:30.080 --> 27:32.920
We called them
"close encounters of the third kind."

27:33.000 --> 27:34.360
This is how he responded.

27:35.560 --> 27:37.080
Was New York clean?

27:37.160 --> 27:38.440
To tell you the truth,

27:38.520 --> 27:40.920
New York is like
any other city in the world.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.320
-Was it clean?
-No.

27:42.840 --> 27:46.960
-It was dirty.
-But… there are problems in every city.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.560
We saw a lot of garbage there.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.560
I… At first, I didn't get it.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.320
I thought "garbage" meant garbage,

27:55.400 --> 27:57.560
but he was actually referring
to the Mafia.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.480
I was talking about
American garbage

28:01.560 --> 28:03.120
in terms of your meetings.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.640
You were referring to other things.
I… I… I didn't get it.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.880
None of the people
you are alluding to were there.

28:13.160 --> 28:16.280
Pino Maniaci let me respond
about the events in America

28:16.360 --> 28:17.800
and give my opinion.

28:18.680 --> 28:23.280
But with his… his, let's say,
usual way of doing things,

28:24.560 --> 28:27.360
when he… eh… did that report,

28:27.440 --> 28:33.120
he manipulated my… my… my interview,
my response, everything,

28:33.880 --> 28:36.200
so nothing I said made sense.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.600
APRIL 2018

28:45.320 --> 28:47.760
GIOACCHINO DE LUCA
AND THE BORGETTO COUNCIL

28:47.840 --> 28:50.480
SUE MANIACI FOR DEFAMATION

28:52.360 --> 28:55.080
MANIACI TRIAL
ACCUSATION OF DEFAMATION

28:55.160 --> 28:56.800
WITNESS: DE LUCA

29:00.800 --> 29:03.880
Mr. De Luca, can you summarize
the terms of your complaint

29:03.960 --> 29:06.240
against Giuseppe Maniaci's TV report?

29:07.640 --> 29:09.160
When I returned from America,

29:09.920 --> 29:11.680
Mr. Maniaci did a report

29:13.040 --> 29:17.160
saying that we didn't go there
to represent the Borgetto Council

29:17.800 --> 29:20.880
but to meet some mafiosos
originally from Borgetto.

29:24.520 --> 29:28.840
He tarnished all of us
with this absurd, ridiculous slander,

29:28.920 --> 29:31.920
which is just a… a… a problem in his head.

29:32.000 --> 29:32.920
He made it up.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.480
So, Mr. De Luca.

29:39.640 --> 29:42.640
I… I'd like to show
the witness some photos.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.600
I'm showing you the first page
of the file called

29:50.480 --> 29:53.280
"Video recordings, USA visit."

29:56.520 --> 30:00.280
I want to know
if you recognize the person on the right

30:01.560 --> 30:05.640
wearing dark glasses,
and a sort of shirt, and necklace.

30:11.280 --> 30:12.200
Do you know them?

30:13.080 --> 30:13.920
No.

30:15.800 --> 30:16.920
Did you look properly?

30:19.240 --> 30:22.120
-And answer into the microphone.
-No. I said "no."

30:22.200 --> 30:23.920
-You don't know them?
-No.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.320
The person I showed you…

30:30.640 --> 30:34.800
…is one Francesco Rappa,
known as "One-handed Frank."

30:40.280 --> 30:44.480
He's a known member
of the Cosa Nostra Mafia organization.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.760
Does the name mean anything to you?

30:54.720 --> 30:57.400
If you watch Pino Maniaci's broadcast,

30:57.480 --> 31:00.200
if the prosecutor doesn't have a copy,
I do...

31:00.280 --> 31:01.960
-Excuse me.
-He talks about--

31:02.040 --> 31:04.480
Mr. De Luca, please. Answer my question.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.480
-I am answering.
-I didn't ask you about--

31:07.560 --> 31:09.920
-I'm answering.
-Forget Pino Maniaci.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.360
You need to give me time to answer.
There were so many people there,

31:13.440 --> 31:16.720
and I don't doubt it
because the photos prove he was there.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.880
I didn't see him or know him.
I don't know who you're talking about.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.960
But if you saw him,
would you recognize him?

31:22.480 --> 31:23.480
Absolutely not

31:24.640 --> 31:28.520
because to be honest--
When did this man go to America?

31:28.600 --> 31:32.200
No, you don't ask the questions.
Answer the questions!

31:32.680 --> 31:34.000
I don't know him! I don't!

31:34.080 --> 31:36.880
-I don't know him!
-I object. Don't raise your voice.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.000
It's a simple clarification request.

31:39.600 --> 31:42.840
Your Honor.
I can do what I want in cross-examination.

31:42.920 --> 31:46.000
-No, you can't!
-She objects, and you decide!

31:46.080 --> 31:49.960
I said, "If you saw him,
would you recognize him?"

31:50.040 --> 31:52.720
I said no, I don't…
I said it. I don't know him.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.840
-Okay.
-I don't know him.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.400
I deny it categorically. I don't know him!

32:05.200 --> 32:08.400
Today we've won a battle
but not the war

32:08.480 --> 32:11.520
because there are still things
to be done to win the war.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.320
Despite everything,
I still believe in justice.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.240
We'll see.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.560
MAY 2017

32:29.560 --> 32:31.000
TELEJATO NEWS

32:32.520 --> 32:36.200
Borgetto Council
is disbanded due to Mafia infiltration.

32:36.280 --> 32:39.720
Very serious forms of interference
of organized crime have emerged.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.040
Welcome to today's Telejato News.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.680
Let me say that we are not happy

32:49.040 --> 32:50.920
to hear that the Borgetto Council

32:51.000 --> 32:54.640
has been disbanded
due to serious Mafia infiltrations.

32:56.480 --> 32:57.840
This proves

32:58.560 --> 33:00.400
that everything we've been saying

33:01.240 --> 33:02.800
is in fact true.

33:04.360 --> 33:08.360
FOLLOWING AN INVESTIGATION
BY THE CARABINIERI INTO MAFIA INFILTRATION

33:08.440 --> 33:09.600
IN BORGETTO'S COUNCIL

33:09.680 --> 33:12.600
DE LUCA WAS REMOVED
FROM HIS POST AS MAYOR IN 2017

33:15.560 --> 33:16.800
Before our editorial,

33:17.320 --> 33:19.200
which will tell you the whole story,

33:19.720 --> 33:21.920
we want to start with some reports

33:22.000 --> 33:23.880
that we have done over time.

33:27.840 --> 33:31.160
The investigations have left
no doubt that the Mafia

33:31.240 --> 33:34.560
played a crucial role
in favoring the election of some figures

33:34.640 --> 33:37.520
in the Council belonging
to Mayor De Luca's Party.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.320
What will the ex-Mayor do now?

33:55.200 --> 33:59.080
I'm proud that I was Mayor of Borgetto.
I did it with all my heart.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.560
I was elected democratically.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.400
I tried to do
positive things for this town.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.040
He spread false information,

34:11.560 --> 34:13.360
and he still gets to carry on,

34:13.440 --> 34:14.640
but I can't anymore.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.400
I was chucked out.

34:18.480 --> 34:19.560
I was suspended.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.440
It was a huge injustice.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.880
He continues to say that I was disbanded

34:29.960 --> 34:31.480
for Mafia infiltration.

34:32.080 --> 34:35.520
No. It was for being suspected
of Mafia infiltration,

34:35.600 --> 34:37.000
which is a different thing.

34:37.080 --> 34:40.240
Accusations that I met
with Mafia members in New York.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.160
All of this is unfounded.

34:42.720 --> 34:46.480
There's no proof, and the investigations
have found absolutely nothing.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.440
My case has been archived,

34:49.520 --> 34:52.240
and he carries on
spreading false information.

35:09.040 --> 35:13.240
In Pino Maniaci's trial,
the most serious accusation is extortion.

35:16.760 --> 35:20.680
The video made by the Carabinieri
was considered by the prosecutor

35:20.760 --> 35:23.600
as one of the main pillars
supporting the extortion charge.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.560
We know that Pino is innocent.

35:28.480 --> 35:32.000
We just have to find a way to show
that the video is unreliable.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.960
Imagine paying extortion money so readily,

35:44.040 --> 35:46.880
with the person being extorted
right in front of a camera,

35:47.400 --> 35:50.440
counting the money very clearly
and speaking out loud.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.640
It was all too perfect.

35:57.880 --> 36:01.320
And when it's all too perfect,
it means something's not right.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.520
De Luca knew that that room was bugged.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.000
He knew he was being watched.

36:11.280 --> 36:12.240
It was a setup,

36:13.640 --> 36:15.000
it was a trap for Maniaci.
