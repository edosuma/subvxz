WEBVTT

01:21.880 --> 01:23.880
Are you listening?

01:23.960 --> 01:25.960
Finally answered.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.520
Dad...

02:08.080 --> 02:10.080
Massimo...

02:10.160 --> 02:12.630
Franco Iannone from the
Italian Treasury is coming to you.

02:12.710 --> 02:14.890
I bet he wants to discuss their bonds.

02:15.250 --> 02:17.590
I need to know how
Dominic will hold an auction.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.130
I'll be back as soon
as I can. I'll do it.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.900
Thank. Till. Take care of yourself.

02:22.980 --> 02:26.010
Dominic would not have arranged an
auction if it had not been so important.

02:26.700 --> 02:29.690
We must be in London. Not here.

02:41.810 --> 02:43.810
It's not like you remember?

02:45.960 --> 02:47.960
I don’t know why I came.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.620
Maybe he wants to
make peace. He is dying.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.220
This driveway is closed,
understand? I'm going home.

03:12.630 --> 03:15.340
This is not the best place to
stay. And not the best time.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.210
I didn’t come to rest. Go away.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.820
Massimo Massimo Ruggiero?

03:22.860 --> 03:24.860
Good afternoon. I'm glad to see you.

03:25.090 --> 03:27.130
Did you come to your
father? Say him hello from me.

03:27.170 --> 03:29.170
Thank.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.400
You had the nerve to come back.

03:34.550 --> 03:36.550
Drive through!

03:39.220 --> 03:41.220
What was it?

03:41.350 --> 03:43.350
They don’t like tourists here.

03:45.460 --> 03:47.850
Many experts consider this
an important stage for Italy.

03:47.940 --> 03:50.430
Weekly Bond Auction

03:50.560 --> 03:53.640
is critical to its economic stability.

03:54.220 --> 03:57.280
They say that the Ministry
of Economy plans to offer

03:57.380 --> 04:00.560
from five to eight billion
euros in government bonds.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.400
It is he? Franco Iannone.

04:03.570 --> 04:07.330
On TV, he seems taller. Why
is Massimo interested in this?

04:08.030 --> 04:10.140
Because it is interesting to Dominica.

04:10.220 --> 04:12.220
How do I get into a deal?

04:12.740 --> 04:15.580
Find out who is selling Chris Bailey,

04:16.500 --> 04:19.980
and get rid of him. Ask Oliver.

04:20.149 --> 04:22.150
Never. He knows.

04:23.060 --> 04:26.160
Are you asking me for help?

04:26.800 --> 04:30.530
I need a name. You ask me for help!

04:31.090 --> 04:33.090
Do not bully your nose.

04:43.260 --> 04:46.980
Richard had to leave today, and I'm
replacing him in a deal with Yannone.

04:48.350 --> 04:53.370
Who said? And where did Richard go?

04:53.850 --> 04:56.510
Family problems. And
considering that Mr. Yannone

04:56.590 --> 04:59.170
puts up five billion in Italian bonds,

04:59.260 --> 05:01.270
It was worth immediately
calling me. Truth?

05:02.770 --> 05:04.770
Why is this?

05:05.020 --> 05:07.650
At a minimum, I am your best seller.

06:06.970 --> 06:08.970
Dad!

06:34.290 --> 06:37.520
Massimo! Come on. Come here.

06:49.270 --> 06:51.270
You look awful.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.080
Is this girl with you? Yes.

07:02.330 --> 07:04.490
You always loved the cute ones.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.700
How do you feel?

07:08.780 --> 07:12.330
I would be better if
everyone lagged behind me.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.960
Hush hush.

07:18.820 --> 07:22.550
Since they want to transfer you to
Rome, there is a reason. Is not it so?

07:23.960 --> 07:26.160
I lived at home and die at home.

07:28.930 --> 07:30.930
I'm not one of those who run away.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.320
I'll be back.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.080
Well?

07:41.670 --> 07:44.030
I have to stay here. Okay.

07:44.850 --> 07:47.430
Wait for me at home. I
will come as soon as I can.

07:47.590 --> 07:49.590
Good.

08:08.850 --> 08:11.070
Good morning. What happened?

08:11.670 --> 08:13.670
Massimo Ruggiero is back.

08:15.970 --> 08:19.420
Italy must sell bonds worth

08:19.530 --> 08:22.920
which is equivalent to
all the debt of Greece.

08:23.010 --> 08:25.010
Italy is huge!

08:25.090 --> 08:27.790
This campaign against us
should generate mistrust.

08:27.870 --> 08:31.450
To complicate the
financing of public debt.

08:33.770 --> 08:36.330
PIIGS. Disgusting name.

08:37.110 --> 08:39.240
Yes, not the best term.

08:39.330 --> 08:41.429
But you have to face the truth -

08:41.510 --> 08:43.539
even Reintaler dumps Italian debt.

08:43.950 --> 08:46.770
The last auction was not easy,
we almost went negative.

08:46.950 --> 08:49.240
This time one cannot
make the slightest mistake.

08:49.530 --> 08:53.380
And what do you suggest?
Reduce the offer, raise the price.

08:53.470 --> 08:57.280
This will be a sign of weakness.
Sensing fear, the market can kill.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.680
I can’t take that risk.
We must make sure

08:59.760 --> 09:02.040
that the bonds will
leave at a decent price.

09:02.130 --> 09:05.350
Eleanor will take care of
you. Profitability peaked.

09:05.430 --> 09:07.930
I am sure we will sell all
bonds at the market price.

09:08.020 --> 09:11.130
Well... For the cause! Mr. Yannone.

09:13.670 --> 09:15.670
Many thanks. See you later.
- See you later.

09:15.980 --> 09:18.060
I beg. Bye.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.280
Make an appointment with customers.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.840
Only in person. That
no one would know.

09:27.720 --> 09:31.320
Lower the price. Name
half that we offered him.

09:31.550 --> 09:35.250
But we promised to keep the
price? We must serve the customers.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.510
The Italian government
is also our client.

09:37.590 --> 09:40.100
If the auction goes wrong,
Italy will become Greece.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.300
But ten times worse.

09:43.630 --> 09:47.090
This is your opportunity to prove your
worth to the bank after tricks with VAR.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.640
How is Massimo?

09:54.350 --> 09:56.350
I think it’s normal.

09:57.270 --> 09:59.270
Where is he?

10:00.770 --> 10:03.160
Just like you,
I can only guess, Mr. Morgan.

10:05.690 --> 10:07.900
No one denies that
the country is in crisis.

10:07.990 --> 10:09.990
But we must overcome it together.

10:54.140 --> 10:56.140
Ten years ago Naples...

10:56.360 --> 10:58.540
And I thought I lost you.

10:58.620 --> 11:00.990
I protect our investments. Where?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.740
In a fishing village
on the Amalfi Coast.

11:03.950 --> 11:05.950
Ltd! Clear.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.090
Father Massimo is dying.
And he took you with him?

11:10.170 --> 11:14.090
We need him in London. I
gain his trust, remember?

11:14.750 --> 11:17.260
You yourself ordered to
follow him like a shadow.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.820
Use this trust to get answers.

11:19.910 --> 11:21.910
This is what I do.

11:25.370 --> 11:27.880
You know, Sofia, I think

11:27.960 --> 11:31.110
You missed something in the CDO docs.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.150
And what did I miss?

11:38.290 --> 11:41.230
You must give me answers
before I ask a question.

11:43.390 --> 11:46.500
Otherwise, I will find them myself.

12:13.230 --> 12:15.520
Massimo again? I'm in the ass.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.090
Dominic wants me to lower
the prices of Italian bonds.

12:18.180 --> 12:20.660
To ruin the government?
So say Massimo!

12:21.240 --> 12:24.850
And he forbade me to do this! But
Dominic gave me a direct order...

12:25.170 --> 12:27.170
You're really in the ass.

12:27.700 --> 12:30.550
And if I persuade all customers
to buy them at the same price?

12:30.700 --> 12:33.540
Low but not quite. Then I do
not need to argue with Dominic

12:33.630 --> 12:35.790
or say Massimo. Smart move

12:35.870 --> 12:39.230
but if at least one decides to bring
down the price, you are doubly worried.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.800
So tell me Massimo or not?

12:42.380 --> 12:45.550
No idea. Thanks for the help, Kalim!

12:50.080 --> 12:52.080
Already leaving?

12:53.240 --> 12:55.240
To your fellow bankers?

12:55.950 --> 12:57.950
What do you want?

12:58.830 --> 13:01.780
Death has only one plus -

13:02.870 --> 13:05.670
there is time to think.
So what did you decide?

13:07.250 --> 13:09.250
Come here.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.990
Nearer. Before his death

13:15.510 --> 13:17.510
I would like to fix everything.

13:29.390 --> 13:31.390
Speak.

13:33.750 --> 13:38.120
The bank wants to pick up my boats.

13:40.250 --> 13:44.100
He takes everything that I could earn.

13:45.450 --> 13:49.210
I will not give them
boats! I’ll burn them soon!

13:53.420 --> 13:56.800
If you needed money, I would send.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.130
I don’t need your money.

14:01.330 --> 14:03.330
I want the bank behind me.

14:06.340 --> 14:09.040
They are your friends. Good.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.530
More than twenty percent
of the population of Europe

14:31.610 --> 14:33.990
may now be below the poverty line.

14:46.110 --> 14:48.110
Hey. Hey.

14:52.270 --> 14:54.270
What happened?

14:54.350 --> 14:57.470
In the afternoon,
someone threw a stone at the window.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.110
I think this is for you, your father.

15:02.540 --> 15:06.210
But why should he threaten?
He suffered like everyone else.

15:06.890 --> 15:08.890
I dont know.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.720
Do not you know? No.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.560
Okay. And-and-and what will we do?

15:18.750 --> 15:21.120
Let's talk with the mayor
about father’s boats.

15:21.990 --> 15:25.180
And then get the hell outta
here. Didn’t you hurt you?

15:25.270 --> 15:27.270
No.

15:28.050 --> 15:32.060
Eleanor Borg,
NYL. I promised you a great deal!

15:32.140 --> 15:34.500
Let's talk over coffee.

15:34.590 --> 15:38.110
Hello, this is Eleanor! I
have a great offer for you.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.330
Not for everyone.
Fine! Let's talk later.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.320
This is reliable and
confidential information.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.630
Very interesting. Fine!

15:46.750 --> 15:49.900
This is reliable and
confidential information.

15:50.140 --> 15:53.230
This is Eleanor from NYL! Are you OK?

15:53.320 --> 15:56.210
This is reliable and
confidential information.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.780
Authentic and confidential. Authentic.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.220
This is Eleanor, from NYL. NYL

16:01.310 --> 16:04.390
I have a great offer. Great! Super!

16:05.480 --> 16:08.900
This is reliable and
confidential information.

16:11.330 --> 16:15.680
After 2008, I was insulted
even at my children's school.

16:16.620 --> 16:20.000
I was considered a criminal
only because I worked at a bank.

16:21.510 --> 16:24.740
Auction fraud only
confirms their suspicions.

16:24.860 --> 16:28.780
I only offer the VIP
client a suitable price.

16:28.870 --> 16:32.670
But what about other VIP
customers? What's wrong with them?

16:32.800 --> 16:34.870
You offered them the same price.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.300
Do you know what money

16:38.490 --> 16:41.300
which your bank takes
from the Italian government,

16:41.380 --> 16:43.460
Can I pay to teachers and doctors?

16:43.540 --> 16:46.690
You work for a private foundation,
not a government.

16:48.180 --> 16:50.180
Is it a matter of patriotism?

17:00.550 --> 17:02.550
Heck!

17:14.440 --> 17:18.300
Massimo Welcome home.

17:19.660 --> 17:21.660
Hi Vincenzo.

17:22.170 --> 17:25.040
I heard your father
is sick. I'm sorry.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.130
This is Sofia. Vincenzo Manfredi.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.550
Glad to meet you. Sofia.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.300
Massimo and I were best friends.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.700
A long time ago.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.860
Father says banks are
taking his business for debt.

17:41.990 --> 17:44.290
Excuse me,
can we talk privately with Massimo?

17:46.110 --> 17:48.470
Thank. Come on in.

17:58.950 --> 18:00.950
Massimo

18:02.880 --> 18:04.880
not only your father has problems.

18:05.660 --> 18:07.660
Our whole town suffered.

18:07.740 --> 18:11.570
I had to cut funding for cooperatives,
kindergartens and schools.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.330
All problems are due to
agreements signed with the bank.

18:17.370 --> 18:19.910
They were signed by the
previous administration.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.910
Representatives of the bank
came here and began to talk.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.340
About derivatives and other things.

18:25.670 --> 18:28.190
Massimo, I don’t understand
a damn thing about that.

18:28.530 --> 18:31.660
Every year we have to pay 50 thousand
euros. And we don’t have them.

18:34.870 --> 18:36.870
What?

18:38.300 --> 18:40.300
Not fifty thousand.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.320
What are you talking about? I'm talking
about the amount of half a million.

18:47.450 --> 18:49.980
If interest rates continue to rise,

18:50.650 --> 18:53.690
and it’s possible, it will be even more
difficult for you to repay the debt.

18:54.700 --> 18:59.200
This means that our
city will go bankrupt.

19:10.130 --> 19:12.130
Your mother...

19:16.590 --> 19:19.830
Massimi Hi, Ste.

19:20.090 --> 19:22.560
I thought you would no
longer dare to come here.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.700
But here they are - important bumps...

19:27.910 --> 19:30.850
The mayor of the city and
the millionaire. Enough Stefano!

19:31.030 --> 19:33.030
Shut up yourself.

19:33.990 --> 19:35.990
Are you asking for trouble?

19:38.340 --> 19:41.110
I do not need them.
Then you better leave.

19:42.510 --> 19:47.230
I swear to Madonna, I’ll see
you again - I’ll kill you. Freak.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.720
Let's go guys!

20:03.620 --> 20:06.500
Italy has returned to the bond market,
but despite

20:06.580 --> 20:09.390
what the European Central Bank
has been buying in recent weeks

20:09.470 --> 20:12.270
Italian debt bonds to increase
the percentage of yield,

20:12.360 --> 20:15.260
demand for these
bonds was very modest...

20:15.350 --> 20:18.330
You thought that I would
not know about your setup?

20:19.690 --> 20:21.690
We are a bank.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.460
We bring profit to
customers as we can.

20:24.540 --> 20:26.560
I represent the state,
not the company,

20:26.650 --> 20:29.580
which you can buy or sell.
Countries are companies.

20:29.790 --> 20:32.090
And Italy is on the
verge of bankruptcy.

20:32.260 --> 20:35.200
The auction would have
failed without our setups.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.570
You have no principles!

20:39.200 --> 20:42.900
With all due respect, it’s not for
you to talk to us about principles.

20:43.010 --> 20:47.920
For many years, we have declared high demand
for your bonds, although this is not true.

20:48.110 --> 20:50.220
Our private debt is one
of the lowest in the world.

20:50.300 --> 20:52.506
Everyone in Italy has their
own home and social security.

20:52.530 --> 20:55.030
Wealth not taxed is useless.

20:56.390 --> 20:58.600
We made a difficult
decision... A difficult decision?

21:00.210 --> 21:03.540
Your politicians have been running public
debt for thirty years, buying elections.

21:04.320 --> 21:07.500
Restructuring,
cost reduction - all in vain.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.290
You can blame it on anyone you want.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.050
But the next auction
we will not hold with you.

21:23.290 --> 21:25.560
Someone told him what we had in mind.

21:26.490 --> 21:28.840
Who was that?

21:28.910 --> 21:32.590
Probably Mr. Sarti. It is your fault.

21:32.710 --> 21:35.240
No, it's my fault that I
gave Eleanor this task.

21:35.410 --> 21:38.120
Sorry, what? Massimo claimed

21:38.200 --> 21:40.200
that she has no equal in sales.

21:41.120 --> 21:45.360
Probably,
other factors influenced his judgment.

21:48.970 --> 21:52.580
Check out my track record.
I earned for this company

21:52.660 --> 21:55.460
millions, but didn’t get a raise
due to the death of the boss!

21:55.540 --> 21:57.626
So, you know what? Sorry,
you have crossed all borders.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.450
Hey! I care about the results!
If you are a pro, prove it!

22:00.620 --> 22:02.850
And find out the
relationship elsewhere.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.930
Get out!

22:50.050 --> 22:53.010
This is an internal document of the
investment bank New York - London.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.070
I want you to study every
page under a magnifying glass

22:56.150 --> 22:58.660
and found me something.
What should I look for?

22:59.020 --> 23:03.000
Substitutional assets associated
with nuclear power plants in Moldova.

23:03.380 --> 23:05.380
For the cause.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.360
You can help him.

23:21.780 --> 23:23.780
But I don’t know if I want to.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.830
Let me tell you.

23:29.980 --> 23:34.840
This town is an exact copy of the
place in Argentina where I grew up.

23:36.190 --> 23:38.190
And the same thing happened there.

23:39.020 --> 23:42.410
Bankers came, took all the money.

23:44.370 --> 23:46.440
People suffered and perished.

23:46.530 --> 23:50.360
Those like my brother
suffered and perished.

23:53.950 --> 23:56.240
But these are not my
relatives. Not your loved ones?

23:56.320 --> 23:58.620
Yes, because you're better than them,
Massimo?

23:58.850 --> 24:00.960
You have such a
wonderful life... Come on...

24:01.200 --> 24:03.200
Lucky you.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.990
Even if this city is not your
hometown, this is your homeland.

24:07.340 --> 24:09.650
These are the people you grew up with.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.100
And it’s not at all difficult for you.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.100
See who came.

25:00.940 --> 25:02.940
What the hell are you doing here?

25:07.160 --> 25:09.630
I want to talk. There
is nothing to talk about.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.570
After so many years
you have no questions?

25:12.950 --> 25:15.160
No. None?

25:16.680 --> 25:20.260
Even how much do I get? I don’t
even know exactly how much.

25:20.460 --> 25:22.630
When the salary
reaches a certain amount,

25:22.720 --> 25:24.720
stop counting.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.820
Mostly because I make money,

25:26.900 --> 25:28.910
just by clicking on the
button on the keyboard.

25:30.680 --> 25:33.310
Then what do you want?
And here you plow like slaves.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.800
How? In a day I will earn so much

25:35.880 --> 25:38.090
how much are you in your whole life.

25:39.510 --> 25:41.560
Can you imagine Can you not?

25:45.720 --> 25:47.720
What's wrong with
that? I understood you!

25:51.530 --> 25:53.530
Get out, Massimi.

25:53.610 --> 25:57.700
Do you remember that your father
died because of me? Or forgot?

25:58.420 --> 26:00.420
Come on, Stefano!

26:01.320 --> 26:03.320
Stop it, Massimi!

26:06.090 --> 26:08.470
Yes, and one more thing... Shut up!

26:12.810 --> 26:14.810
I said shut up!

26:25.960 --> 26:28.120
I didn’t feel anything, Ste!

26:32.230 --> 26:35.970
Come again,
for father. Another blow for your dad.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.250
Don't you dare talk about my father,
hear?

26:39.330 --> 26:41.330
Hey Stefano...

26:42.820 --> 26:44.820
Get it, silly!

26:49.840 --> 26:52.420
Enough! - Freak! Enough!

26:59.780 --> 27:01.780
Your boyfriend is a killer!

27:02.890 --> 27:04.890
Dont touch him!

27:05.030 --> 27:07.220
Didn’t you know?

27:07.300 --> 27:09.300
He is a killer!

27:11.170 --> 27:13.170
Get out, Massimo!

27:13.890 --> 27:15.890
Come on.

27:27.450 --> 27:34.500
I tried, Stefano. I tried,
but the current was too strong.

27:36.730 --> 27:38.730
I could not.

27:41.770 --> 27:43.770
But I tried.

27:50.430 --> 27:52.430
Go away.

27:53.520 --> 27:56.410
Go back to London, to your money.

27:58.330 --> 28:00.330
You are not welcome here,
do you understand?

28:00.620 --> 28:03.360
Go away Go away

28:05.150 --> 28:09.080
Come on. Massimo, let's go.

28:09.790 --> 28:12.830
Why are you staring, huh?

28:30.070 --> 28:32.070
Come on...

28:33.340 --> 28:35.600
You can leave a message...

28:35.700 --> 28:37.700
Naples is choking on trash.

28:37.780 --> 28:40.140
The last time he was taken
out a week before Christmas.

28:40.220 --> 28:43.090
Italian government says
local councils are to blame

28:43.170 --> 28:45.420
and organized crime.
Ten years ago in Naples...

28:45.500 --> 28:48.690
Heck. Where is Massimo? - Hell knows.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.730
You always do what he asks?

28:55.580 --> 28:57.580
Good night, Oliver.

28:59.190 --> 29:01.190
You owe me a favor.

29:02.360 --> 29:06.180
And now I'm waiting for the answer.

29:13.660 --> 29:15.960
How many times a day do guys glue you?

29:16.870 --> 29:20.560
ABOUT! Who knows? In the
beginning it was much worse.

29:20.730 --> 29:23.800
And now you have achieved everything,
and everyone is behind?

29:24.600 --> 29:26.600
Now everything is different.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.700
If something important breaks down,
it is because the woman freaked out.

29:29.780 --> 29:32.920
Ha. And how are you doing?

29:34.580 --> 29:36.580
This time is bad.

29:39.370 --> 29:41.480
Means

29:41.560 --> 29:45.770
if you can’t bring this
Sarti back to business,

29:46.770 --> 29:48.840
do you have a cap

29:48.920 --> 29:51.970
For years, built a career,
and that’s it.

29:56.250 --> 29:58.250
But still...

30:01.010 --> 30:03.010
thank.

30:07.920 --> 30:10.320
Italy's economy cannot collapse!

30:10.420 --> 30:13.010
Yes, this is a large economy,
but money is needed to save it.

30:13.090 --> 30:15.636
Italy is embroiled in a debt crisis.
This is the largest economy...

30:15.660 --> 30:18.300
How bad is the Italian economy doing?

30:18.380 --> 30:23.500
This is a tough time. And
we were in an emergency.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.830
We must act with
maximum determination,

30:25.910 --> 30:28.230
without looking for
excuses or loopholes.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.720
We know that partly
the cause of this crisis

30:30.810 --> 30:33.030
is not ability and not desire...

30:33.240 --> 30:37.180
Hey. How are you? Let me have a look.

30:38.390 --> 30:40.390
Everything is fine.

30:47.610 --> 30:50.750
What did you achieve?
Wanted to punish yourself?

30:54.470 --> 30:56.470
I do not know.

30:58.730 --> 31:00.990
Stefano said you killed his father.

31:07.930 --> 31:09.930
He drowned.

31:12.570 --> 31:14.570
When we stole his boat.

31:16.050 --> 31:18.050
Who are we?

31:23.400 --> 31:25.660
Vincenzo and I.

31:27.860 --> 31:29.920
Vincenzo, who is the mayor?

31:31.220 --> 31:33.220
Yes.

31:33.640 --> 31:37.330
Talk to me. Tell me what happened.

31:47.370 --> 31:49.370
How long have you been here?

31:56.220 --> 31:58.220
Two years.

32:02.190 --> 32:04.980
How did father Stefano
end up in the water?

32:07.780 --> 32:09.780
He chased us in a boat.

32:13.080 --> 32:15.080
We wanted to crash into it.

32:15.160 --> 32:17.270
I screamed for Vincenzo to slow down,

32:17.380 --> 32:19.620
but he did not hear me
because of the roar of the motor.

32:24.530 --> 32:27.650
It is not your fault.
You were still a boy.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.900
The judge decided otherwise.

32:56.890 --> 32:58.890
And what was Vincenzo?

33:03.830 --> 33:06.920
Nothing. What does it mean nothing?

33:11.040 --> 33:13.300
Vincenzo's father
was very influential.

33:15.370 --> 33:18.300
He would not let his son
sit down for the murder.

33:20.470 --> 33:26.590
So he paid my father
to cover Vincenzo.

33:28.570 --> 33:30.570
We lived very poorly.

33:32.330 --> 33:36.340
He took this money,
and bought the first boat on it.

33:46.980 --> 33:49.510
And everyone kept their mouth shut.

33:50.810 --> 33:52.810
To punish me alone.

34:06.510 --> 34:08.760
The boy who killed Stefano's father.

34:33.500 --> 34:37.600
They say they make good
Italian coffee here, Mr... Sarti...

34:38.330 --> 34:40.330
Do we know each other?

34:40.620 --> 34:42.880
I work at a New York-London bank.

34:43.179 --> 34:45.929
Your colleague called
for reinforcements.

34:46.389 --> 34:48.659
Listen, don’t stop me
from enjoying espresso...

34:48.739 --> 34:51.280
I have been working
at the bank recently.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.300
But you have been in this
business for a long time, right?

34:56.210 --> 34:58.210
It’s not easy.

34:58.540 --> 35:01.440
Constant pressure, risks, fraud.

35:01.520 --> 35:05.340
It's hard for anyone
like you to bear it.

35:06.010 --> 35:08.010
You don't know anything about me.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.450
I know that last year you
wanted to get into the IMF,

35:11.930 --> 35:14.610
to work where you wouldn’t
have to get your hands dirty.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.100
Where you could change something.

35:18.180 --> 35:20.940
What are you getting at,
mister? Harris - Harris.

35:21.260 --> 35:23.260
Oliver Harris.

35:23.520 --> 35:26.160
But you were not accepted
into the Monetary Fund last year.

35:27.430 --> 35:30.810
And my boss, Dominic Morgan,

35:32.670 --> 35:34.670
possesses tremendous power.

35:35.150 --> 35:39.940
Do a favor to Mr. Morgan and his bank,
and in return we will help you.

35:41.180 --> 35:43.830
In Italy, this is called corruption.

35:46.070 --> 35:48.070
And here...

35:52.270 --> 35:54.270
this is called mutual assistance.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.970
Massimo, what happened?

36:12.210 --> 36:14.280
Met Stefano.

36:17.150 --> 36:20.380
Could you deal with these bankers?

36:20.460 --> 36:22.460
Yes.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.920
Did you think about that?

36:35.020 --> 36:37.620
About what? About what happened.

36:37.940 --> 36:39.940
What happened?

36:42.080 --> 36:44.200
Have you thought about
what you did to me?

36:50.450 --> 36:52.450
But look at how you became.

36:53.610 --> 36:55.650
You have succeeded.

36:55.730 --> 36:57.820
The prison tempered you.

36:59.110 --> 37:01.290
You have to thank me.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.960
I’ll deal with bankers.

37:13.010 --> 37:15.010
But on one condition.

37:40.010 --> 37:42.230
What is Sarti doing here? You two,

37:42.320 --> 37:45.300
to Mr. Morgan’s office. Alive.

37:46.590 --> 37:49.600
You betrayed me? Remember,
you did it all yourself.

37:55.720 --> 37:57.940
Sorry, let's get back to this later,
okay?

37:58.020 --> 38:00.020
Thank. Good.

38:01.290 --> 38:03.290
Come on in. Have a seat.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.950
Gentlemen, Massimo Ruggiero.

38:15.590 --> 38:17.590
Sarti came.

38:18.720 --> 38:23.240
Oliver told me that
you offered him a bribe.

38:24.660 --> 38:26.660
Place in the IMF.

38:27.110 --> 38:29.440
Mr. Morgan, I... Too trite

38:31.320 --> 38:33.320
but effective.

38:33.900 --> 38:36.990
Sarti will be silent. Congratulations.

38:37.820 --> 38:40.370
I did my job,
Mr. Morgan. You're doing fine.

38:41.890 --> 38:43.890
So, that’s it. Thanks to all.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.360
How did you make them
change the conditions?

39:03.150 --> 39:05.430
Their documents were
not compiled correctly.

39:15.260 --> 39:17.560
Surely you hate me for what happened.

39:17.650 --> 39:19.710
You were only thirteen, Vincenzo.

39:19.900 --> 39:22.880
My father left me no choice;
He defended his reputation.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.120
When they put you in

39:26.220 --> 39:28.430
until his death he did
not look at me as before.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.960
Will you come to the hospital with me?

40:00.600 --> 40:02.600
I beg you, Massimo.

40:02.870 --> 40:05.540
No one should know! What will
it change after so many years?

40:05.890 --> 40:08.180
Think of my family!
I’m the mayor of hell!

40:08.260 --> 40:10.340
You speak like your father.

40:11.940 --> 40:15.110
When your father put the blame on you,
you could refuse.

40:15.260 --> 40:18.620
But you needed money
to leave here. To run away.

40:40.890 --> 40:43.040
I came at the request of your father.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.980
I give my boats to you.

41:03.030 --> 41:05.030
All five pieces.

41:05.350 --> 41:08.540
In addition to the first,
she remains my family.

41:10.770 --> 41:12.770
It belongs to Massimo.

41:13.120 --> 41:16.670
And everything else - nets,
hooks and gear -

41:18.820 --> 41:20.820
this is all yours.

41:22.720 --> 41:26.840
Thanks, Aeneas,
but I cannot accept them.

41:26.920 --> 41:30.350
Everything is already framed.
You think it's that simple?

41:31.890 --> 41:33.980
Will you give me the
boats and leave for London?

41:34.060 --> 41:36.060
Think what you want.

41:36.140 --> 41:40.080
If boats are not needed,
burn them. Anything.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.620
I thought I trimmed you harder.

42:22.440 --> 42:25.090
What exactly did you say
to Monsieur Berlusconi?

42:25.170 --> 42:28.220
Did he promise you
new reforms in Italy?

42:28.300 --> 42:30.910
He... could he dispel your
fears? Everybody knows,

42:30.990 --> 42:33.560
that the rating agencies
of the "Big Three"

42:33.640 --> 42:35.640
still conducting an
assessment of Italy.

42:45.070 --> 42:47.070
Who made you lower the price?

42:47.150 --> 42:51.070
I had no choice,
Massimo. You know. Truth?

42:53.300 --> 42:55.300
Yes. I know.

42:59.150 --> 43:01.150
Till.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.880
What?

43:05.300 --> 43:09.150
Dominic attacks Italy. Other
countries will follow suit.

43:10.550 --> 43:12.720
When will you be back? I dont know.

43:13.310 --> 43:15.310
I’ll linger here for a while.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.160
You did the right thing.

43:19.310 --> 43:21.900
For the sake of the
city. For your sake.

43:25.990 --> 43:29.760
Too bad you need to go
back to London. Me too.

43:34.380 --> 43:36.800
We can escape to some island.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.500
Do you want with me?

44:55.390 --> 44:57.390
Have a good rest?

45:01.290 --> 45:03.890
Where is Massimo? Stayed in Italy.

45:04.170 --> 45:06.170
He is with his father.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
So what happened?

45:24.300 --> 45:27.490
CDO papers. Why didn’t
you say that you have them?

45:28.570 --> 45:31.180
You rummaged through my
things. Please answer the question.

45:31.260 --> 45:33.260
You don't trust me anymore?

45:35.910 --> 45:39.130
Bond Collateral - Fake Assets

45:39.210 --> 45:41.320
and an abandoned nuclear power plant.

45:42.190 --> 45:44.680
You said that you didn’t
find anything in Moldova.

45:45.360 --> 45:48.570
That's right, I didn’t find
it. What about your photos?

45:54.550 --> 45:56.550
The station is abandoned

45:56.630 --> 45:59.290
but the score was consistent
with government records.

45:59.370 --> 46:03.440
So this is not a forgery.
Well. You could tell me.

46:04.750 --> 46:06.750
You could ask.

46:08.620 --> 46:13.230
But the rest of the assets are dummy,

46:13.310 --> 46:15.940
then this is evidence of a conspiracy,

46:16.020 --> 46:19.480
which could destroy Dominic
Morgan and the fucking NYL.

46:23.730 --> 46:27.590
That's great. Yes. Great.

47:12.380 --> 47:14.380
You're staying?

47:20.010 --> 47:22.010
Yes.

47:23.350 --> 47:25.350
I did it

47:27.440 --> 47:29.440
to get out of poverty.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.310
In my place you would do the same.

47:38.130 --> 47:40.130
Do not hold evil.

47:42.810 --> 47:45.790
You are just like me.

47:47.180 --> 47:49.870
You are just like me.

47:51.090 --> 47:53.620
Italy's debt reaches record levels

47:53.700 --> 47:55.916
since the conclusion of the
transaction with the eurozone.

47:55.940 --> 47:58.510
The country had to offer
such a payback ratio,

47:58.590 --> 48:01.100
which has not existed since
joining the single currency.

48:01.180 --> 48:03.920
Italy now promises yield
of more than six percent

48:04.000 --> 48:06.780
compared to 5.8 a month ago.

48:07.430 --> 48:11.040
Italy could be the next victim
of the European debt crisis.

48:11.120 --> 48:13.790
Investors are betting,

48:13.870 --> 48:17.010
that the days of Silvio Berlusconi as
prime minister are already numbered.

51:03.860 --> 51:07.420
I did this to stop
another attack on Italy

51:07.500 --> 51:10.450
and protect her from
financial speculation.

51:11.120 --> 51:14.090
Is this the very moment
when the curtain falls

51:14.170 --> 51:17.070
and put an end to the theater
of one actor Silvio Berlusconi?

51:17.200 --> 51:19.510
Mr Berlusconi finally resigned.

51:19.590 --> 51:21.650
If the worst happens,

51:21.740 --> 51:25.060
Are you claiming that it is too
expensive to save Italy? Wait a minute!

51:25.140 --> 51:28.090
Italy's economy did not seem large
when it was accepted into the eurozone.

51:28.120 --> 51:30.380
And not big enough to save now.

51:30.460 --> 51:32.460
Why then was she invited?
