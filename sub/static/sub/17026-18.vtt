01:59.678 --> 02:02.398
(CARTER) Sit? Do you want me to sit?

02:02.398 --> 02:04.398
Yeah, we're rolling.

02:04.398 --> 02:05.398
OK.

02:08.157 --> 02:11.958
It's a little warm in here.
Must be the, uh...

02:11.958 --> 02:15.598
All right, so you guys
started yesterday, huh?

02:15.598 --> 02:17.758
You can relax, Dr Carter.

02:17.758 --> 02:21.838
And you're interested in, what?
life in the ER?

02:21.838 --> 02:26.838
We're documenting the challenges of
emergency care in the 21st century.

02:26.838 --> 02:29.158
And you want to know what?

02:29.158 --> 02:32.838
About you, the people
who work here. What you do.

02:32.838 --> 02:34.398
OK.

02:34.398 --> 02:37.598
How long have you
been at County?

02:37.598 --> 02:39.838
I started about 15 years ago.

02:39.838 --> 02:44.878
That's actually
kind of hard to believe. Wow...

02:44.878 --> 02:47.278
Can you focus here? Yeah.

02:47.278 --> 02:49.958
Oh, here? Yeah.

02:49.958 --> 02:51.238
Sorry.

02:51.238 --> 02:55.398
Oh, uh, I was a med student
then, and, uh...

02:55.398 --> 02:59.518
Well, the thing that you realize
pretty soon is that you see it all.

02:59.518 --> 03:01.798
You see all of human experience.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.878
Does that sound
a little pretentious?

03:07.878 --> 03:11.318
It did, right? Sound a little
pretentious, uh...

03:11.318 --> 03:13.758
Well, you guys
are going to probably...

03:13.878 --> 03:15.678
Go on with that.

03:15.678 --> 03:17.358
Yeah? Good?

03:17.518 --> 03:20.118
Um, well, whatever you
can imagine, it happens here.

03:20.278 --> 03:23.478
Sometimes you're there
for the end.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.998
And that part
never gets any easier.

03:25.998 --> 03:30.118
Uh, it can be the loneliest
place in the world.

03:31.757 --> 03:35.957
Or where you go
for a second chance.

03:38.317 --> 03:40.557
And every once in a while,

03:40.557 --> 03:44.277
if you're smart,
or lucky, maybe...

03:44.277 --> 03:48.717
you find exactly
what you need right here.

03:48.717 --> 03:50.557
Come on. You can be
a little late.

03:50.677 --> 03:51.757
No, I can't.

03:51.877 --> 03:53.717
What's so important?

03:53.877 --> 03:56.077
Um, a murder
investigation?

03:56.237 --> 03:58.717
Oh, that's the best
you can come up with? You're cute.

03:58.717 --> 04:01.917
Hey, did you mean
what you said?

04:01.917 --> 04:04.357
You hate the way
this place is decorated?

04:04.517 --> 04:07.557
You're a man, OK?
Just get rid of the futon.

04:07.677 --> 04:08.757
I love that futon.

04:08.917 --> 04:11.597
And what's with this paint job?
It's like shades of faeces.

04:11.597 --> 04:14.877
I was a bachelor
till very recently.
Give a guy a break.

04:14.997 --> 04:17.476
I'll whip you into shape.

04:48.237 --> 04:50.757
The one thing
that you keep learning

04:50.757 --> 04:54.797
is that you can never think
that you know what's coming.

04:54.797 --> 04:56.357
Policia!

04:59.397 --> 05:02.477
Because when the rig rolls up,
and the doors pop open,

05:02.597 --> 05:04.957
you have no idea what's inside.

05:04.957 --> 05:06.597
GUNSHOTS

05:11.356 --> 05:12.796
Diaz?!

05:12.796 --> 05:15.116
Diaz, talk to me!

05:15.116 --> 05:18.396
10-1, 10-1. Beat 54-12,
my partner's been shot.

05:18.396 --> 05:22.676
I need an ambulance at 2549 West
Harrison, third floor, rear landing.

05:22.676 --> 05:26.036
Returned fire,
offender's locked inside.

05:26.036 --> 05:29.596
So the only rule is...never relax.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.036
< Dr Carter?

05:31.036 --> 05:34.356
Sorry to interrupt.
Two GSWs five minutes out.

05:34.356 --> 05:36.276
One's a police detective.

05:36.276 --> 05:41.276
Set up both trauma rooms
and call for some O-neg. I got to go.

05:41.276 --> 05:43.556
Can we finish
this later?

05:43.556 --> 05:46.316
Yeah. If you can find me.

05:55.596 --> 05:59.156
The most common thing I see?
That's easy.

05:59.156 --> 06:01.156
Rectal insertions.

06:01.156 --> 06:02.636
Seriously.

06:02.636 --> 06:06.596
I say, I say "stat."
Yeah, I say "stat" quite often.

06:06.596 --> 06:10.396
This guy, he was, um...
he was high on PCP.

06:10.396 --> 06:14.516
But he was, like, over seven feet
tall, and we had him strapped down.

06:14.516 --> 06:16.956
I mean, the funny part is,
is that

06:16.956 --> 06:21.476
it doesn't matter if it's a shampoo
bottle, a light bulb, whatever.

06:21.476 --> 06:25.276
They always tell you
the same story - "I fell on it."

06:25.276 --> 06:27.076
"Thoracotomy, stat!"

06:27.076 --> 06:28.436
"I fell on it."

06:28.436 --> 06:30.836
And that guy got up,

06:30.836 --> 06:34.236
and he had the gurney strapped
to...strapped to his back.

06:34.236 --> 06:37.196
And he was chasing us
all up and down the hall.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.916
Men...

06:38.916 --> 06:42.076
People in Australia can
understand me, which is good.

06:42.076 --> 06:44.676
I've got an accent,
you see, um...

06:45.836 --> 06:51.355
"Just clerks"? Those were his words?
"Just clerks."

06:51.355 --> 06:55.355
He said that we didn't count
as emergency healthcare providers.

06:55.355 --> 06:56.555
Who is "he"?

06:56.555 --> 06:58.155
A writer, I think.

06:58.155 --> 07:00.915
Of a documentary?
Documentaries have writers?

07:00.915 --> 07:02.955
Well, he pieces it together.

07:02.955 --> 07:05.595
Well, that's what's wrong with TV.

07:05.595 --> 07:07.115
He seemed like a pipsqueak to me.

07:07.115 --> 07:09.755
So you've met him?

07:09.755 --> 07:12.035
He interviewed us yesterday.

07:12.035 --> 07:13.475
The nurses?

07:13.595 --> 07:14.635
Got their own day?

07:14.795 --> 07:17.755
Get over it, Frank.
We go to school for this.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.355
That's it.

07:19.515 --> 07:23.835
If they can make their own
stupid reality show, so can I.

07:23.955 --> 07:25.755
Can't argue with that.

07:25.915 --> 07:28.035
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

07:28.155 --> 07:30.675
Here. Press and point.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.635
You know how to work it.

07:32.795 --> 07:35.235
There's nothing wrong with a life
lived out of the spotlight.

07:36.955 --> 07:40.035
A stack of files, a broken stapler,

07:40.195 --> 07:44.635
a three-hole punch... But lives
are saved and lost right here.

07:44.635 --> 07:46.875
It's a desk, Frank.

07:47.035 --> 07:49.835
Admit, the nerve center
of the ER.

07:49.835 --> 07:56.275
What you're about to see
is a document of the gatekeepers.
My name is Frank Martin.

07:58.835 --> 08:00.635
Jerry Markovic.

08:00.635 --> 08:03.555
The few, the proud...

08:03.555 --> 08:06.315
(BOTH) The desk clerks.

08:06.315 --> 08:09.315
That film crew
get to you yet?

08:09.315 --> 08:12.715
They just asked me questions
about the effect of the economy.

08:12.715 --> 08:16.755
People get poor and they use guns
to get money and the ER stays busy.

08:16.755 --> 08:20.155
What are we getting?
I heard officer down.

08:20.155 --> 08:22.915
A detective. How'd he get shot?
He's a she.

08:22.915 --> 08:25.595
This one's ours.
Perp's coming behind.

08:25.595 --> 08:27.674
Claudia Diaz,
I think you guys know her.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.034
She and Morris have a thing.

08:30.034 --> 08:32.313
"A thing"?
Is that what it is?

08:32.313 --> 08:33.474
(CARTER) What happened?

08:33.474 --> 08:36.394
Son of a bitch shot me
when I was walking away.

08:36.394 --> 08:38.594
Lucky you had your vest on.

08:38.594 --> 08:40.354
Yeah, I feel real lucky!

08:40.354 --> 08:42.634
Here's the shooter. Took multiple
shots from her partner.

08:42.634 --> 08:45.114
Let's get chest and abdominal
films, type and cross...

08:45.114 --> 08:47.034
Type and cross four...

08:47.034 --> 08:49.514
You OK?
Yeah. Work on access
when we get in there.

08:49.514 --> 08:50.634
Does Archie know yet?

08:50.634 --> 08:52.834
My partner said he'd call him.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.834
I'll try, too, just to be sure.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.514
Thank you
for bringing breakfast.

08:57.514 --> 08:59.274
Yeah, this is nice.

08:59.274 --> 09:04.274
You like it? I was torn between
eggshell white and something bolder.

09:04.274 --> 09:06.994
Like a, like a robin's egg
type thing.

09:06.994 --> 09:10.994
Now I sound gay. I mean, not that
there's anything wrong with that.

09:10.994 --> 09:12.634
You're nervous.

09:12.634 --> 09:15.834
It's kind of risky, asking her
to move in. Maybe she'll say "no."

09:15.834 --> 09:18.674
I think any girl appreciates a guy
willing to repaint for her.

09:21.074 --> 09:25.194
How are things going
with the wonder from Down Under?

09:25.194 --> 09:29.834
Good...I guess.
As long as we don't talk much.

09:29.834 --> 09:31.074
Typical guy.

09:31.074 --> 09:35.394
You fellas have to have your
deepest thoughts and feelings pried

09:35.394 --> 09:37.514
from your cold,
dead fingers, but...

09:38.794 --> 09:42.914
Still, he's hard to figure.

09:42.914 --> 09:47.194
Well, it's understandable
with what happened to him as a kid.

09:47.194 --> 09:49.474
I told him he needs
to see somebody.

09:49.474 --> 09:52.674
You know, if you've been hurt
like that sexually,

09:52.674 --> 09:56.594
at a young age, it doesn't just
go away on its own.

09:58.634 --> 10:02.634
Well, it's, um...good
he confides in you.

10:02.634 --> 10:05.034
Well, it's been
hard for him.

10:05.034 --> 10:09.033
There's you and there's me.
His whole circle of friends.
Real ones, anyway.

10:09.033 --> 10:10.473
Right.

10:17.113 --> 10:22.113
Wait. You didn't...?
He never told you?

10:22.113 --> 10:24.313
Hmm-mm, it, um...

10:24.313 --> 10:26.233
Neela, I'm sorry.

10:26.233 --> 10:29.713
It explains a lot.
I have to get to work by 9am.

10:29.713 --> 10:32.713
We've got a complicated
triple-a repair, so um...

10:32.713 --> 10:35.273
No, Neela...
I'll see you later.

10:36.593 --> 10:39.633
TELEPHONE RINGS

10:42.473 --> 10:43.513
Hello?

11:01.793 --> 11:03.193
Decreased on the right;
ten blades,

11:03.353 --> 11:04.433
sterile eights
and a, um...

11:04.433 --> 11:07.633
And a chest tube tray.

11:09.873 --> 11:11.993
Hey. She took two shots,

11:12.153 --> 11:13.593
one to the buttock,
one to the shoulder.

11:13.753 --> 11:14.953
We got an exit wound
in the right chest.

11:15.113 --> 11:18.873
I told you to get a desk job.
Shot me in the back.

11:18.873 --> 11:21.433
How's your partner? He's OK.
You were covered?

11:21.433 --> 11:22.753
Any pain here? OW, yeah!

11:22.753 --> 11:25.193
It wasn't like that.

11:25.193 --> 11:26.833
How do you know?
It was clean, Archie.

11:26.833 --> 11:29.113
Fur milligrams morphine IV, set up...

11:29.113 --> 11:31.393
Is 32 OK?
No, it's not, it's too big!

11:31.393 --> 11:35.233
John, let's just get the films.
I'll do the chest tube.

11:35.233 --> 11:36.593
Sats 88.

11:36.593 --> 11:38.473
Just dig up a 28, would you?

11:38.473 --> 11:41.553
Are you sure
you're OK with this?

11:41.553 --> 11:44.113
It's all you guys.
This has to stay on you, OK?

11:44.113 --> 11:46.272
Let me get the sterile eights,
please.

11:47.752 --> 11:50.432
Bullet crossed the mediastinum.

11:50.432 --> 11:53.072
(GATES) That doesn't sound good.
Probable aortic injury.

11:53.072 --> 11:54.872
I need a 28.
Try the hallway.

11:54.872 --> 11:57.392
Whoa, whoa, half a litre out.

11:57.392 --> 11:58.552
Hold compressions.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.192
He's still asystole.

12:00.192 --> 12:04.352
OK, start up.
Let's, uh, let's hang another unit.

12:04.352 --> 12:07.752
Should we do a thoracotomy?

12:07.752 --> 12:09.512
There isn't much point.

12:09.512 --> 12:10.792
It's worth a shot.

12:12.592 --> 12:16.152
When you're new,
everything's a question.

12:16.152 --> 12:22.112
Even when you know you know
something, you say it
with an inflection.

12:22.112 --> 12:25.032
It's never, "thoracotomy!"

12:25.032 --> 12:29.352
It's more like, um,
"thoracotomy?"

12:31.032 --> 12:33.072
KNOCKING >

12:33.072 --> 12:34.832
You got my smokes?

12:34.832 --> 12:36.992
Hi.

12:38.192 --> 12:44.912
The orderly said he'd get me a carton
of Salems for the right price.
That was two days ago.

12:44.912 --> 12:48.472
I hate smoking these things.
Taste like wet leaves.

12:48.472 --> 12:50.552
Where's Carlos?

12:50.552 --> 12:54.992
I was, uh, hoping today
would be the day you'd remember me.

12:54.992 --> 12:58.672
I remember you...well enough.

12:59.552 --> 13:03.312
I'm your daughter. I'm Sam.

13:03.312 --> 13:05.392
I said, I know who you are.

13:05.392 --> 13:06.872
WHEEZING

13:06.872 --> 13:08.912
They told me you been around.

13:12.712 --> 13:14.832
It's good. You're more alert.

13:14.832 --> 13:18.352
Yeah, this place
is like a dream come true.

13:18.352 --> 13:20.672
I feel like
i won the Super Lotto.

13:20.672 --> 13:22.272
WHEEZING

13:22.272 --> 13:24.431
Turn off my tank for me, would you?

13:26.191 --> 13:29.551
You can't smoke in here,
it's against the rules.

13:29.551 --> 13:30.991
What?

13:32.951 --> 13:36.591
So it's your turn now,
is that right?

13:36.591 --> 13:38.151
WHEEZING

13:38.151 --> 13:42.511
I want to make sure
that you're OK. Kelly and I both do.

13:42.511 --> 13:44.511
Kelly never left.

13:44.671 --> 13:48.031
Kelly stayed home
and took care of me.

13:48.191 --> 13:49.631
I don't know
what you've been doing.

13:49.791 --> 13:51.631
You kicked me out.
I didn't.

13:51.791 --> 13:54.071
You called me a "whore"
and a "slut."

13:54.191 --> 13:56.951
You said you didn't care
what happened to me.

13:56.951 --> 13:58.351
You were always dramatic.

13:58.351 --> 14:01.071
You told me no-one would even
notice I was gone.

14:02.071 --> 14:03.911
I was 15 years old.

14:07.351 --> 14:10.831
What happened
to that baby of yours?

14:18.671 --> 14:21.031
His name's Alex.

14:21.031 --> 14:23.791
Alex?

14:26.631 --> 14:29.191
When a head injury
rolls into the ER,

14:29.311 --> 14:31.431
every minute counts.

14:32.671 --> 14:35.391
And, um...
Delays. Talk about delays.

14:35.511 --> 14:39.671
A delay of even 15 minutes

14:39.831 --> 14:43.111
can mean the difference
between life...

14:43.111 --> 14:45.871
and death.

14:49.311 --> 14:51.871
Here's the pelvic film.

14:51.871 --> 14:53.911
And Brenner's calling it next door.

14:53.911 --> 14:56.431
Guy lost a lot of blood.

14:56.431 --> 14:58.551
How are we doing in here?

14:58.551 --> 15:01.750
I'm going to be late for a meeting.
She's not lucid.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.270
They lose him? (HALEH) Yeah.
I doubt anyone'll miss him.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.390
A guy died.

15:07.230 --> 15:11.030
(CARTER) Bullet traversed the pelvis.
Could've hit the bladder or uterus.

15:11.030 --> 15:12.430
Where's surgery?

15:12.430 --> 15:15.990
In the OR. They promised they'd send
someone in a few minutes.

15:15.990 --> 15:17.630
There's fluid around the liver.

15:17.630 --> 15:18.870
Tachy, 134.

15:18.870 --> 15:22.390
Let's hang another unit. She going
to need an ex lap. Or maybe not.

15:22.390 --> 15:25.910
Let's CT her. She could be in
and out of the scanner in, like,
ten minutes.

15:25.910 --> 15:28.110
Christ. Mac 4 and 7.5.

15:28.110 --> 15:29.310
Intubate?

15:29.310 --> 15:31.150
Yeah, we've got
to protect her airway.

15:31.150 --> 15:32.310
Her lungs are re-expanded.

15:32.310 --> 15:34.470
THIS ISN'T THE TIME!
IS IS THE TIME. He's right.

15:34.470 --> 15:37.590
You're right.
Laryngoscope and a tray, please.

15:37.590 --> 15:42.030
How's she doing?
How's it look?
Hang in there, Diaz.
What happened?

15:42.030 --> 15:45.910
We were taking witness statements.
Some guy started shooting
through the door.

15:45.910 --> 15:48.510
Can I get that laryngoscope,
please?!

15:48.510 --> 15:49.870
Where were you?
Right next to her.

15:49.870 --> 15:52.150
Huh, not a scratch.
You're a lucky guy.

15:52.150 --> 15:54.430
Problem?
Not so long as you had her back.

15:54.430 --> 15:56.270
You'll want to think about
slowing your roll here.

15:56.270 --> 15:58.510
Is that what I want to do? Archie...

15:58.510 --> 16:00.670
A badge beats
a lab coat any day.

16:00.670 --> 16:03.430
Band of brothers, right?
Where's the department?

16:03.430 --> 16:06.030
On their way, pal. Ease up.
This guy always such an asshole?

16:06.030 --> 16:08.910
You want to get into it with me,
huh?!

16:08.910 --> 16:10.790
Hey, hey!

16:13.910 --> 16:14.710
All right, you got us
both in frame there, Boris?

18:39.908 --> 18:41.348
(boy)
I'm Max and that's

18:41.468 --> 18:42.828
my best friend
Henry.

18:42.908 --> 18:44.948
We spend lots of time together.

18:45.068 --> 18:46.468
- (purrs)
- When I'm at school

18:46.588 --> 18:48.428
he has to
play by his self.

18:48.548 --> 18:50.828
- His favourite toy is the whale.
- Miaow!

18:51.308 --> 18:54.108
But Mum says he loves fish
even better.

18:54.388 --> 18:56.068
New Whiskas Oh so,

18:56.188 --> 18:58.948
with the whole pieces of fish
that cats love.

18:59.028 --> 19:01.428
Naturally rich in omega 3.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.188
I'm trying to catch him some fish,

19:03.268 --> 19:04.988
but he won't let me.

19:05.108 --> 19:08.548
My cat loves Whiskas
and I love my cat.

19:12.428 --> 19:14.868
When skin is well moisturised,
tans look more even.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.308
So Dove Summer Glow
blends subtle self-tanners

19:17.428 --> 19:19.588
with rich moisturisers
that smooth skin,

19:19.708 --> 19:21.548
letting your tan
develop more evenly.

19:21.668 --> 19:23.548
Dove - good for your skin,
great for your look.

19:23.628 --> 19:25.268
Even more to smile about.

19:25.348 --> 19:26.308
Dove Summer Glow,

19:26.428 --> 19:28.428
up to half price
at selected retailers.

21:12.027 --> 21:17.827
You are freakishly tall
and Frank's head
is square like block of wood.

21:17.827 --> 21:19.107
Thanks, Spielberg.

21:19.107 --> 21:25.107
In this segment, we are going to
highlight some of the unsung heroes
of the ER.

21:25.107 --> 21:29.827
First up is Sadiq,
the computer guy.
Sadiq Gilbran-Hassani.

21:29.827 --> 21:31.947
I'm not just a "computer guy."

21:31.947 --> 21:35.507
My family has illustrious history
in Syria before we were forced out.

21:35.507 --> 21:39.186
Let's just try to stay
on point, sadiq, OK?

21:39.186 --> 21:42.306
Without me, there'd be
no timely lab results

21:42.306 --> 21:44.506
or X-ray readings which are crucial.

21:44.506 --> 21:47.546
You let me know when I can speak
again. OK, Uncle Sam?

21:47.546 --> 21:48.986
Thank you, Sadiq.

21:48.986 --> 21:50.346
You're the boss.

21:50.346 --> 21:53.666
And this is Crystal Hung,
pharmacy tech.

21:53.666 --> 21:59.426
OK, when a doctor says, "I need an
amp of lidocaine," a nurse gets it.
No lidocaine, it's a problem.

21:59.426 --> 22:04.026
I put the lidocaine in the cart
every damn day. So that's that.

22:04.026 --> 22:05.386
Interesting.

22:05.386 --> 22:07.306
Very interesting.

22:07.306 --> 22:12.986
And here we have good ol'
Fred Tennyson, service engineer
and catcher for the softball team.

22:12.986 --> 22:15.466
I switch out
whatever's broken.

22:15.466 --> 22:18.026
Like light bulbs. Without
light bulbs, it's hard to see.

22:18.026 --> 22:20.986
And doctors, they...

22:20.986 --> 22:25.786
Well, you know,
they need to see stuff.

22:25.786 --> 22:29.786
And uh, here we have...?

22:32.266 --> 22:34.746
From the cafeteria?

22:43.946 --> 22:47.586
And without food,
we would all go hungry.

22:51.386 --> 22:56.706
And on camera,
we have Boris from Media services.

22:56.706 --> 22:59.706
Please, leave me out of this.
This is horrible.

22:59.706 --> 23:01.586
When was your last dialysis?

23:01.586 --> 23:03.826
Dialysis?

23:03.826 --> 23:07.786
Banfield thought I should know.
Since you were gonna be working.
Two days ago.

23:07.786 --> 23:10.946
Must be fluid overloaded
since he's not making urine.

23:10.946 --> 23:12.346
Are you waiting on
a kidney transplant?

23:12.346 --> 23:13.546
Yes. Long story.

23:13.546 --> 23:15.066
Any fever?
No.

23:15.066 --> 23:17.386
Increased salt
or fluid intake?

23:17.386 --> 23:21.905
Maybe an extra sip of coffee,
a handful of popcorn, nothing crazy.

23:21.905 --> 23:25.145
Sometimes this kind
of thing is idiopathic.

23:25.145 --> 23:27.505
It can happen
with chronic dialysis.
I know.

23:27.505 --> 23:29.905
Systolic's down to 92.

23:29.905 --> 23:33.465
Let's get nephrology down here.
I'll grab the ultrasound.

23:33.465 --> 23:36.465
If there's a big effusion,
we need to tap it.

23:36.465 --> 23:40.505
Get my nephrologist -
Gustavo Petrov at Northwestern.

23:40.505 --> 23:41.865
Anyone else
you want us to call?

23:45.105 --> 23:47.305
No.

23:47.305 --> 23:49.745
I'll be right back.

23:49.745 --> 23:52.905
Pelvic trajectory goes
through the soft tissues.

23:52.905 --> 23:55.105
Could have bagged
the iliac vessels.

23:55.105 --> 23:57.225
How's she doing?
She needs angio.

23:57.225 --> 23:58.865
She should go
to the OR first.

23:58.865 --> 24:00.665
It didn't enter
the peritoneum.
We don't know that.

24:00.665 --> 24:04.625
Let's not argue here. I'm not
denying she needs surgery.

24:04.625 --> 24:07.785
Let's look at the iliacs first.
There's no hematoma.

24:07.785 --> 24:09.505
She starts bleeding
while you're in the OR?

24:09.505 --> 24:11.305
We'll deal with it.
Vascular standing by?

24:11.305 --> 24:14.945
You're not listening to me.
You're not thinking
things through.

24:14.945 --> 24:16.665
No?
No.

24:16.665 --> 24:17.985
We've got time to
be systematic here.
Systematic?

24:17.985 --> 24:21.105
Angio, retrograde cystogram.
Let's not lose our heads.

24:21.105 --> 24:23.585
Calm down and make a decision.

24:25.025 --> 24:27.425
Archie, it's your call.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.305
Angio or surgery?

24:30.905 --> 24:34.265
You guys need
to decide this.

24:34.265 --> 24:38.705
Bone fragments to the bladder wall.
She needs the OR.

24:38.705 --> 24:44.945
The pace down here is visceral.
It demands being instinctive...
in the moment.

24:44.945 --> 24:48.505
I prefer having time to think
something through,

24:48.505 --> 24:52.145
hash out different
possible versions, make a plan.

24:52.145 --> 24:54.625
I mean that's why I'm better
at being a surgeon

24:54.625 --> 24:57.145
than I was working in the ER.

25:00.544 --> 25:02.904
You're going to get in trouble
if they catch you.

25:07.584 --> 25:09.384
Maybe they'll throw me out.

25:09.384 --> 25:11.784
You know, if you don't want me
here, you should just say so.

25:14.144 --> 25:17.744
It's not like I'm going to leave,
but at least we could talk about it.

25:19.744 --> 25:23.744
Why don't we just try to forget our
mistakes and wipe the slate clean?

25:23.744 --> 25:26.144
Mistakes? What mistakes?

25:26.144 --> 25:28.464
The ones that
we both made.
Speak for yourself.

25:28.464 --> 25:33.864
I'm not going to sit here and play
along with you as the martyr
and me as the evil child.

25:33.864 --> 25:36.464
You don't have to sit here
at all.

25:36.464 --> 25:40.064
I was young and dumb and in love,
Mom. I believed everything he said.

25:40.064 --> 25:43.104
I raised you better than that.

25:43.104 --> 25:45.104
No, you didn't.

25:45.104 --> 25:48.384
You actually... No, you didn't.

25:48.544 --> 25:51.424
What is this? it's all wet.
You spill something?

25:51.424 --> 25:52.664
Leave it.

25:52.664 --> 25:55.824
I'll get somebody
to clean it up.

25:55.824 --> 25:57.304
No, it's just fine.

25:57.304 --> 25:58.624
It's what they get paid for.

25:58.624 --> 26:00.744
I said stop it.

26:00.744 --> 26:02.704
It's disgusting.
It's not...

26:02.704 --> 26:04.784
Would you please get out
of here, you little bitch!

26:04.784 --> 26:07.064
Get out! Just get out of here!

26:07.064 --> 26:09.664
Give it to me! Give it to me!
Just get out!

26:11.304 --> 26:14.864
Mary, I was coming to get
you for flex and fun. You ready?

26:14.864 --> 26:20.544
Do I look like I'm ready
for flex and fun, you idiot?

26:33.744 --> 26:38.264
So your mother's stroke
affected her frontal lobe.
Do you know what that is?

26:38.264 --> 26:39.903
Yes, I'm a nurse.

26:39.903 --> 26:42.143
I thought you were in fashion.
No, that's my sister.

26:42.143 --> 26:45.383
I didn't realize
there were two of you.

26:45.383 --> 26:50.263
What we see with frontal lobe
injuries is the filters come down.

26:50.263 --> 26:54.383
The ability to self-censor,
be sensitive, tends to be affected.

26:54.383 --> 26:56.903
Yeah, I know what
you're getting at.

26:56.903 --> 27:01.863
So the things that she says it's not
really her. It's the stroke talking.

27:03.703 --> 27:06.143
I appreciate
what you're saying.

27:06.143 --> 27:11.863
I do, but the thing is, is that
my mother hasn't changed a bit.

27:11.863 --> 27:18.623
What you see in there that's
who I grew up with. That's exactly
how I remember her.

27:18.623 --> 27:21.823
Could use a bit more angle
on that needle.

27:23.463 --> 27:25.783
Eureka.
Good. I'll be right back.

27:27.143 --> 27:30.783
We'll, um, do a liver lac,
then explore the pelvis.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.503
Urology will fix
the bladder.

27:32.503 --> 27:35.183
Gyn will scrub in
to address the uterine issue.

27:35.183 --> 27:37.543
Primary repair
will get it done?

27:37.543 --> 27:39.863
She may need
a hysterectomy.

27:39.863 --> 27:42.143
Whatever you have
to do.

27:44.463 --> 27:47.943
Four more units cross-matched.
We'll have 'em sent up with her.

27:47.943 --> 27:49.303
OR's ready.

27:49.303 --> 27:53.823
I hate the fact that you put
yourself in danger every day.

27:55.583 --> 27:58.983
Every time you do,
I'm so proud of you.

28:01.583 --> 28:03.103
OK, let's go.

28:15.423 --> 28:16.743
How's it going?

28:16.903 --> 28:20.062
Fluid is serosanguinous and Johnny
boy here is a backseat driver.

28:21.182 --> 28:23.782
Dr Carter? John?
Dr Carter? John!

28:23.782 --> 28:25.862
He's in v-tach! No pulse.

28:27.182 --> 28:28.462
Did I irritate his myocardium?
No, it's not your fault.

28:28.462 --> 28:32.022
500 of calcium gluconate,
amp of D50, 10 of insulin.

28:32.022 --> 28:35.942
We don't know his potassium level.
Trust me, it's high if the kidneys
can't excrete it.

28:35.942 --> 28:37.902
Charge to 360. Clear!

28:39.262 --> 28:41.382
Still v-tach. Again! Clear!

28:43.182 --> 28:45.022
Again!

28:45.022 --> 28:47.662
Hi, you guys have
a consult for renal?

28:47.662 --> 28:50.302
Mig of epi, 150 of amiodarone.
Excuse me, Dr....?

28:50.302 --> 28:52.542
Emily Haverman from nephrology.

28:52.542 --> 28:54.582
Gates, switch.

28:54.582 --> 28:56.622
You're a med student?

28:56.622 --> 28:58.942
Fourth year.
I'm doing a rotation.

28:58.942 --> 29:00.462
That is an ER attending
coding on the table,

29:00.462 --> 29:06.262
so please turn around, walk out, get
your attending, and come back now.

29:06.262 --> 29:09.182
I'm sure Dr Wheeler would prefer it
if I...

29:09.182 --> 29:12.422
If you're not walking away
from me within three seconds,

29:12.422 --> 29:17.822
I swear to God, I may start
doing compressions on your head.

29:17.822 --> 29:21.262
I spent a lot of years
in the army

29:21.262 --> 29:27.022
jumping out of choppers and...
I thought I was a team player.
I wasn't.

29:27.022 --> 29:28.702
Not until I got here.

29:28.822 --> 29:30.422
Whoa, k's 7.6.

29:30.582 --> 29:34.062
Calcium's on board.
Going again. Clear!

29:34.142 --> 29:35.702
Back in sinus.

29:35.702 --> 29:37.382
Carotid's good.

29:37.542 --> 29:40.982
Recheck the lytes
now and q 30.

29:40.982 --> 29:43.822
I'm Dr Wheeler from nephrology.
My attending.

29:43.942 --> 29:45.182
Perfect timing.

29:47.142 --> 29:48.702
Morris...

29:49.822 --> 29:53.462
You saved me?
I'll never live it down.

29:57.422 --> 29:58.861
Mom?

30:01.781 --> 30:04.181
I gotta get to work.

30:05.941 --> 30:07.701
When's Kelly coming back?

30:07.821 --> 30:09.101
I'm not sure.

30:09.181 --> 30:13.061
A week, maybe.

30:13.261 --> 30:17.381
I must have spilled some water
on that blanket or something.
I don't know.

30:17.501 --> 30:19.581
I'll take care of it.

30:19.701 --> 30:21.661
I'll get it back to you tonight.

30:22.221 --> 30:24.501
WHEEZING

30:29.621 --> 30:31.981
I'm gonna keep coming here,

30:32.141 --> 30:34.861
no matter what.

30:37.421 --> 30:39.461
You won't go through this alone.

30:42.701 --> 30:45.821
You do what you gotta do.

30:48.021 --> 30:50.501
We all have our cross to bear.

31:02.141 --> 31:05.381
You know, the unos list
can take a long time.

31:05.381 --> 31:07.941
Have you thought
about direct donation?
Yeah.

31:07.941 --> 31:10.861
And...?
Your wife not a match?

31:10.861 --> 31:14.061
If not, you know, we have a paired
organ-donor program here.

31:14.061 --> 31:16.861
The two of you could
qualify for that.
I'm aware of that.

31:16.861 --> 31:19.941
I just haven't talked
to Kem about that yet.

31:19.941 --> 31:22.261
There's very little
risk in testing.

31:22.261 --> 31:26.541
It's just not something
we're in a place to get together
on right now.

31:26.541 --> 31:29.541
Does she know
about your status?

31:31.061 --> 31:36.821
She knows that I have some medical
issues. I came back to Chicago.

31:36.821 --> 31:41.260
She's in France.
She's visiting her family.

31:41.260 --> 31:44.940
I left the whole thing
kind of vague.

31:44.940 --> 31:47.940
OK. I will shut up now.

31:48.060 --> 31:50.420
I'm just kind of tired.

31:50.540 --> 31:52.340
I'll split.

31:52.500 --> 31:53.540
Pull that curtain
for me?

31:53.660 --> 31:54.660
You got it, boss.

31:56.220 --> 31:57.940
Hey, I didn't realize
you were coming in.

31:58.060 --> 31:59.260
Yeah, me, either.

31:59.460 --> 32:01.140
I got paged for
an organ transport -
heart donor.

32:01.340 --> 32:02.740
Plane leaves
in two hours.

32:02.860 --> 32:04.660
How's your mom?

32:04.940 --> 32:08.540
feel like Jodie Foster
in Silence Of The Lambs.

32:08.700 --> 32:11.380
Fun. Hey, no offense,
but this smells like piss.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.700
I'm supposed to bring that to her
tonight, but now I'm never
gonna make it.

32:13.700 --> 32:16.020
I'll take care
of it for you.

32:16.180 --> 32:17.460
Really?
Yeah.

32:17.660 --> 32:20.380
All you really have
to do is send it up to laundry.
Not a problem.

32:20.380 --> 32:22.580
Sure you don't mind?

32:22.580 --> 32:24.660
Did I not just
volunteer?

32:24.660 --> 32:28.340
You know, you're not such an ass
as some people say.

32:28.340 --> 32:29.780
Thank you.

32:33.740 --> 32:36.980
Um, what were we talking about?

32:36.980 --> 32:41.980
Oh. But you know, eventually,
I started to figure things out...

32:41.980 --> 32:44.940
as a doctor, you know,

32:44.940 --> 32:49.260
and how I fit in professionally
with this place,
this community of people.

32:49.260 --> 32:52.940
Yeah, that's a big, big part
of it...

32:52.940 --> 32:58.220
for me is being good
with yourself

32:58.220 --> 33:04.300
and who you are...
and who you're meant to be.

33:04.300 --> 33:08.780
You know, finding yourself.

33:08.940 --> 33:12.300
And then there's
the next step...

33:12.420 --> 33:14.620
after that, which is...

33:14.740 --> 33:17.939
finding somebody else.

33:20.899 --> 33:23.579
And sometimes you think...

33:23.699 --> 33:25.659
"No, that's just...

33:25.779 --> 33:28.979
"That's never gonna happen
for me."

33:29.099 --> 33:31.499
And you meet someone...

33:32.779 --> 33:35.139
who makes you feel...

33:35.139 --> 33:37.339
you know...

33:37.339 --> 33:41.219
who-who-who gets you.

33:41.219 --> 33:43.459
And-and you get her.

33:46.459 --> 33:50.179
Some-someone you can,
you can imagine...

34:16.139 --> 34:18.579
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34:21.418 --> 34:22.498
People think all we do

34:22.659 --> 34:24.498
is scrub poop and vomit
off the floor,

34:24.659 --> 34:27.859
pero I refill the paper towels,
the toilet papers,

34:28.018 --> 34:31.259
stock the soap,
the dispensers.

34:31.418 --> 34:33.978
Without clean hands,
you get lots of bad infections.

34:34.099 --> 34:35.978
She's right.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.498
Nosocomial infections
cause over 30,000 deaths

34:38.619 --> 34:40.299
in the US each year.

34:40.418 --> 34:42.299
He knows.

34:43.819 --> 34:47.018
So, boys, what's this all about?

34:47.018 --> 34:52.498
Oh, the interview guy said
that we were non-essential staff.

34:52.659 --> 34:53.899
Non-essential?

34:54.018 --> 34:55.619
We're offering a rebuttal.

34:55.779 --> 34:58.258
You're essential.
You're quintessential.

34:58.378 --> 34:59.818
Yeah.

34:59.938 --> 35:01.738
I'm sure
you'll set him straight.

35:01.898 --> 35:03.498
Let me get a
little rest, eh?

35:03.618 --> 35:04.658
Yeah.

35:04.658 --> 35:06.698
Hey, hey, I think

35:06.698 --> 35:09.378
this lady's having an allergic
reaction or something.

35:09.538 --> 35:12.578
We'll page somebody. Let's put her
right over here.

35:12.698 --> 35:13.778
(FRANK) Let's get Morris.

35:13.778 --> 35:14.978
Morris is upstairs.

35:14.978 --> 35:16.778
Brenner?

35:16.898 --> 35:18.218
Uh, critical ICU.

35:18.418 --> 35:21.378
How long have
you had this rash?
An hour.

35:21.538 --> 35:22.578
She's having trouble
breathing.

35:22.578 --> 35:23.618
Penis!

35:23.778 --> 35:24.738
Did she say "penis"?

35:24.858 --> 35:26.578
This is getting a little weird.

35:26.698 --> 35:27.898
Pea-nuts!

35:28.058 --> 35:31.098
Peanuts! I knew a kid
who had this in school.

35:31.218 --> 35:33.218
And?

35:33.338 --> 35:34.458
He died.

35:34.458 --> 35:38.538
Oh, man, she's not
moving any air.
We need help.

35:38.658 --> 35:41.098
Uh... Uh... No, we don't.

36:04.418 --> 36:06.258
Oh, thank you!

36:06.258 --> 36:07.578
Yeah?

36:08.978 --> 36:12.058
Oh, in your face,
reality boy!

36:12.058 --> 36:14.498
Yeah, do we look
non-essential now?!

36:26.538 --> 36:29.338
I thought you'd be upstairs
working on Claudia.

36:29.338 --> 36:31.578
Uh, urology's doing
the bladder reconstruction.

36:31.698 --> 36:33.658
They swapped me out
for their own resident.

36:33.738 --> 36:35.058
Ah.

36:35.218 --> 36:38.657
I'm, um, going
on a heart retrieval,

36:38.817 --> 36:40.537
so I figured
I'd grab a coffee.

36:40.657 --> 36:41.617
What do you have?

36:41.777 --> 36:42.777
A heart retrieval
for Joanie?

36:42.897 --> 36:44.817
Yeah, it's good news.

36:44.937 --> 36:46.457
That's fantastic!

36:46.577 --> 36:48.017
The, uh, heart's in Seattle,

36:48.137 --> 36:50.577
so we won't be back
until the middle of the night.

36:50.697 --> 36:53.017
Right.

36:53.137 --> 36:55.937
Are we all right?

36:58.817 --> 37:00.337
What do you think?

37:02.497 --> 37:05.937
Um, that...
something's bothering you?

37:05.937 --> 37:07.737
Clever twist.

37:09.377 --> 37:11.377
Forget it.

37:12.937 --> 37:16.457
No. Explain it to me.

37:16.457 --> 37:19.217
How is my being
worried about you a twist?

37:19.377 --> 37:22.497
Because you keep
turning everything around.

37:22.657 --> 37:26.017
I don't think I'm smart enough
to fight with you.

37:26.137 --> 37:27.697
Like that.

37:27.857 --> 37:30.817
You're plenty smart enough,
but right now

37:30.937 --> 37:32.897
it's easier to make me
seem hyper-analytical

37:33.017 --> 37:34.457
and this morning,

37:34.617 --> 37:35.817
wasn't going your way,
so I was "irrational."

37:35.937 --> 37:36.977
I never said you were...

37:37.097 --> 37:38.257
I'm the one
who's bothered

37:38.377 --> 37:39.697
by something. I'm the one

37:39.857 --> 37:41.657
refusing to have
a reasonable conversation,

37:41.817 --> 37:44.937
and I'm the one
who doesn't make sense.

37:45.017 --> 37:46.057
It's all a defense mechanism.

37:46.177 --> 37:47.617
Defense for what?

37:47.737 --> 37:50.337
I don't know.

37:50.457 --> 37:52.377
Something you haven't told me?

37:52.537 --> 37:55.337
I don't tell anyone
everything.

37:55.457 --> 37:57.017
Then what are we doing?

37:58.017 --> 38:00.857
We hit a speed bump weeks ago

38:00.937 --> 38:02.857
and you react by disappearing.

38:03.017 --> 38:04.257
We see each other
all the time.

38:04.417 --> 38:05.857
We talk.
We sleep together...

38:06.017 --> 38:09.297
There's a way to do all those
things and still disappear.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.977
Why would I want to do that?

38:13.057 --> 38:14.777
Tell me.

38:19.536 --> 38:22.376
Look, Neela, there are...

38:22.376 --> 38:24.456
There are things that
should be kept private.

38:24.456 --> 38:27.936
Not if we are trying to figure out
if they belong together.

38:27.936 --> 38:29.496
I'm comfortable with you.

38:29.496 --> 38:31.816
Well, maybe
that's not enough,

38:31.816 --> 38:34.856
not when I have to find out
important things

38:34.856 --> 38:37.816
about you from other people.
Oh, so that's it?

38:37.816 --> 38:40.736
What, I'm not chatty enough,
so you go snooping around, trying to
get under my skin?

38:40.856 --> 38:42.376
No. It's not like that.

38:42.536 --> 38:46.176
Trying to make me
share my emotions and...

38:46.176 --> 38:50.416
and talking
about every stupid damn thing
that bothers me? No.

38:52.056 --> 38:54.016
NO!

38:55.296 --> 38:59.256
Look, a terrible thing
was done to you.

38:59.256 --> 39:00.696
I understand that.

39:00.696 --> 39:04.136
And I hate
that it happened.

39:06.296 --> 39:12.216
But somewhere in all of what's gone
on between us, one thing is clear.

39:14.656 --> 39:17.056
We're not meant to be together.

39:19.136 --> 39:22.136
It doesn't mean we don't care
about each other deeply, but...

39:25.696 --> 39:28.176
You know, I truly believe

39:28.176 --> 39:31.456
there's something better
out there for both of us.

39:33.376 --> 39:35.176
Whenever we're ready for it.

39:37.536 --> 39:39.416
Better?

39:39.416 --> 39:42.096
Something more right.

40:49.855 --> 40:51.895
# TO TUNE OF
"SELF PRESERVATION SOCIETY"

40:52.615 --> 40:56.135
# We are

40:57.215 --> 40:59.895
# Your old wood pines for some TLC

41:00.535 --> 41:02.055
# Spray in half the time

41:02.135 --> 41:03.415
# That works for me

# We are The Wood Preservation

41:19.855 --> 41:21.335
(disco music)

41:21.335 --> 41:25.015
Hey, homeowners, some things are
so good you can't help bustin' moves

41:26.015 --> 41:29.895
Like getting up to Â£75,000
home contents cover free

41:29.895 --> 41:32.575
when you buy More Than
buildings insurance.

41:32.575 --> 41:35.054
And 20% off that too.

41:35.054 --> 41:36.534
Twice as nice.

41:36.534 --> 41:38.254
What's that, Mr House?

41:38.254 --> 41:40.214
The kitchen sink's covered too?

41:40.734 --> 41:42.654
Call.

41:46.214 --> 41:48.174
Don't be a stranger.

41:51.614 --> 41:53.054
Flu viruses can spread

41:53.054 --> 41:56.214
if you don't catch your coughs
or sneezes hygienically,

41:56.214 --> 41:59.254
passing flu from person to person.

41:59.254 --> 42:02.454
Flu viruses can live on hard surfaces
for several hours,

42:02.454 --> 42:04.694
making flu easy to spread.

42:04.694 --> 42:06.974
To prevent the spread of flu
when you cough or sneeze

42:06.974 --> 42:08.614
catch it in a clean tissue,

42:08.614 --> 42:12.334
bin it, and kill it by washing
your hands as soon as you can.

42:12.334 --> 42:13.654
Call for
the latest.

42:20.054 --> 42:22.174
Now there's a new
anti-wrinkle formula...

42:22.374 --> 42:24.774
..that helps me feel
more daring, even up close.

42:24.854 --> 42:26.734
New RoC Retin-Ox Wrinkle Filler.

42:26.934 --> 42:29.174
For the first time ever, we've
combined Hyluronic Acid...

42:29.454 --> 42:30.774
..and Retinol
in a daily
moisturiser.

42:31.134 --> 42:33.414
It rapidly
smoothes skin
to reduce the
appearance...

42:33.494 --> 42:34.934
..of fine lines and wrinkles.

42:35.014 --> 42:36.054
Now, I'm ready for any close-up!

42:41.974 --> 42:43.934
(engine starts)

42:48.534 --> 42:50.254

# Pretty one, when you gonna gimme

# Never gonna stop, give it up

Bring out your Italian side tonight

43:16.773 --> 43:19.613
and share spaghetti and meatballs

43:19.693 --> 43:22.613
drenched in tomato and herb sauce.

43:23.413 --> 43:25.893
Catch up with friends and family.

43:26.013 --> 43:29.253
Tear off some garlic bread
and pass around the salad.

43:30.093 --> 43:32.533
A traditional Italian meal for four.

43:32.613 --> 43:34.373
Just:

43:36.533 --> 43:38.293
Good with food.

44:30.693 --> 44:32.853
So, Northwestern, huh?

44:32.853 --> 44:34.453
Too good for County.

44:34.453 --> 44:37.973
Well, what can I say, Frank?
I've seen how you care
for your patients here.

44:37.973 --> 44:41.373
Dr Morris says to make sure
they check another potassium
as soon as you get there.

44:41.373 --> 44:42.853
Thanks, Haleh.

44:42.853 --> 44:44.893
We're going
to see you soon, right?

44:45.013 --> 44:46.693
Not if I see you first.

44:46.853 --> 44:50.693
You can visit him
when we're not on the clock.

45:22.732 --> 45:24.492
Um...

45:24.492 --> 45:27.572
Primary repair worked.

45:32.852 --> 45:36.012
So, I guess the world
can look forward to, uh,

45:36.012 --> 45:42.092
a gaggle of olive-skinned kids
with red hair and freckles.

45:46.252 --> 45:48.572
If that's something
that you want.

45:58.012 --> 46:03.332
The life you lead, the things
you have been through...

46:03.332 --> 46:05.812
They define how you do your job,

46:05.932 --> 46:07.492
the quality of...

46:07.612 --> 46:10.292
the quality of your work.

46:10.412 --> 46:12.132
Especially in a place like this.

46:12.292 --> 46:15.372
So at the, um...

46:15.532 --> 46:17.972
At the end of the day,
you choose to...

46:18.092 --> 46:20.332
deny or deal.

46:25.092 --> 46:27.092
And which do you choose?

46:32.051 --> 46:35.211
It's evolving.

46:35.211 --> 46:37.531
I'm evolving.

46:37.531 --> 46:38.811
Um...

46:42.691 --> 46:46.771
All I know is that I know...

46:46.771 --> 46:51.651
um, that there is a lot of work
that I need to do.

46:53.091 --> 46:56.651
Can you be more specific
about that?

46:58.491 --> 47:02.411
No. Not with you.

47:09.091 --> 47:11.211
Mrs Taggart?

47:13.211 --> 47:14.491
Hi.

47:14.491 --> 47:17.371
Tony Gates. I work with Sam.

47:19.771 --> 47:21.811
I used to play.

47:21.811 --> 47:25.371
You know, Christmas time.
Play the carols.

47:25.371 --> 47:27.851
It's all gone now.

47:27.851 --> 47:31.091
Yeah. Well, Sam wanted me
to get this back to you.

47:31.091 --> 47:33.331
Well, she said
she was coming by.

47:33.451 --> 47:35.251
Well, she can't tonight.

47:35.331 --> 47:36.451
She's on a work call.

47:37.531 --> 47:38.571
Uh-huh.

47:38.691 --> 47:40.971
And you are?

47:41.091 --> 47:42.731
I am a friend.

47:42.851 --> 47:43.851
A friend?

47:45.331 --> 47:47.211
Do you smoke?

47:47.331 --> 47:49.451
No, ma'am, I don't.

47:49.571 --> 47:52.051
That's too bad.

47:52.051 --> 47:56.411
You're a good-looking fella,
though, aren't you?

47:56.531 --> 47:58.491
Hmm, must be the lighting in here.

47:59.971 --> 48:04.131
Do you know that out of
all these people in here,

48:04.291 --> 48:08.611
I'm the youngest one
by about 15 years?

48:08.611 --> 48:12.370
What the hell did I do
to deserve this?

48:14.650 --> 48:16.930
I can't imagine.

48:25.890 --> 48:28.810
I don't want her
to stop coming.

48:28.810 --> 48:32.650
So, if she thinks that's so,
you tell her it's not.

48:32.650 --> 48:34.370
OK.

48:34.370 --> 48:40.330
You know,
Sam's an amazing person.
She's very strong.

48:40.330 --> 48:43.610
She's overcome
a lot of obstacles.

48:43.610 --> 48:45.730
You get to know her,
you'd be very proud.

48:45.730 --> 48:48.490
She hates me.

48:48.490 --> 48:51.010
No, she doesn't.
Well, she thinks
that I hate her.

48:51.010 --> 48:52.210
Well, then, change that.

48:54.170 --> 48:55.730
Sure.

48:55.730 --> 48:57.650
Ta-dah!

48:57.650 --> 48:59.770
Changed!

48:59.770 --> 49:03.210
Well... It's up to you.

49:04.810 --> 49:06.570
Have a good night.

49:09.170 --> 49:10.330
Hey.

49:10.330 --> 49:13.090
You're not lying, are you?

49:13.090 --> 49:15.530
She's going
to come back tomorrow?

49:15.530 --> 49:19.090
When Sam makes up her mind,
nothing stops her.

49:32.450 --> 49:34.050
I love helping people.

49:34.290 --> 49:36.770
You know, originally,
i wanted to, um,

49:36.930 --> 49:39.530
be the first baseman
for the Chicago Cubs.

49:39.650 --> 49:40.810
The thing I hate most
about my job?

49:40.890 --> 49:41.970
Mm-hm.

49:42.130 --> 49:44.130
- Smells.
- The smells.

49:44.130 --> 49:46.450
The human body's got
some pretty interesting smells.

49:46.850 --> 49:49.250
What's-what's
the dating life like?

49:49.250 --> 49:51.609
Well, I'm not going to tell you.

49:52.009 --> 49:53.689
It's personal.

49:54.689 --> 49:56.889
A patient is a patient.

49:57.049 --> 50:00.129
Um...pain is pain.
It's-it's universal.

50:00.289 --> 50:03.049
I reached a point
about five years ago

50:03.169 --> 50:06.329
where I started to feel

50:06.489 --> 50:10.969
that every day was the same thing,
and I'd had enough.

50:10.969 --> 50:15.409
But I've been through
a lot of stuff since then.

50:18.929 --> 50:22.969
And now,
I try to embrace the idea

50:22.969 --> 50:27.769
that everything that happens
has never happened before.

50:29.409 --> 50:35.369
Like that saying that you can't
stand in the same river twice

50:35.369 --> 50:40.569
because by the time
that you come back,
it's not the same river.

50:46.609 --> 50:48.649
And you're not the same man.

50:52.209 --> 50:53.929
Anyway...

50:55.969 --> 50:58.049
I look around this place now

50:58.049 --> 51:00.889
and I can't imagine
ever finding it boring.

51:02.249 --> 51:06.849
Cos right at the moment that
you think you've seen it all...

51:06.849 --> 51:12.249
something happens that
you never could have expected.

51:12.249 --> 51:17.249
MONITOR BEEPING

53:06.728 --> 53:07.888
A mum is someone

53:08.008 --> 53:10.527
who knows that
giving kids the freedom to grow up

53:10.647 --> 53:14.647
means getting the balance between
being tough and being gentle

53:14.727 --> 53:16.327
just right.

53:16.447 --> 53:20.087
A mum is someone
who uses Persil because,

53:20.207 --> 53:21.167
for
100 years,

53:21.287 --> 53:22.727
we've
been tough,

53:22.807 --> 53:24.367
but gentle too.

53:25.807 --> 53:28.087
Don't risk having your car crushed.

53:32.087 --> 53:34.287
You can now pay your
car tax by phone.

53:37.767 --> 53:40.847
Dad. I've got some news.

53:40.847 --> 53:43.287
# "Which Will" - Nick Drake

53:49.447 --> 53:51.407
(music covers voices)

53:53.647 --> 53:57.087
Whether you're saying something
momentous or something everyday

53:57.087 --> 53:58.687
it's better to take your time

53:58.687 --> 54:00.127
and use your BT landline.

54:00.127 --> 54:02.247
And with Friends & Family Mobile

54:02.247 --> 54:04.887
calls to mobiles
are now just 7p a minute

54:06.367 --> 54:08.487
Mowing can be a pain,

54:08.567 --> 54:09.847
but not with new

54:09.927 --> 54:11.567
Evergreen Mow It Less lawn food.

54:12.647 --> 54:14.807
It's formulated
to go right to the root,

54:14.887 --> 54:16.727
giving you a thicker, greener lawn.

54:17.367 --> 54:18.647
And it needs
less cutting

54:18.727 --> 54:21.447
than a standard fertilised lawn.

54:24.967 --> 54:26.447
So you can spend more time

54:26.527 --> 54:28.487
relaxing in the garden.

ACOUSTIC GUITAR

54:38.127 --> 54:40.167
At Halifax, we understand that

54:40.287 --> 54:42.767
buying a new home can leave you
a bit stretched.

54:43.967 --> 54:46.127
So choose a mortgage
from our new range,

54:46.247 --> 54:49.646
and we'll pay half
your first year's council tax.

54:50.246 --> 54:52.686
Just apply by 23rd May.

54:52.766 --> 54:54.406
A little extra help from Halifax.

55:17.566 --> 55:18.926
Don't you hate being misled?

55:19.006 --> 55:19.966
"Gigantaburger"?

55:20.086 --> 55:22.086
I was expecting something
at least the size of my head.

55:22.206 --> 55:24.486
"Get the body
you've always dreamed of." Really?

55:24.606 --> 55:26.166
How do you know
what kind of bodies I dream of?

55:26.246 --> 55:27.966
"The funniest film of the decade!"

55:28.086 --> 55:30.406
I doubt it's even the funniest film
about a goat this decade.

55:30.526 --> 55:32.206
- (mouths)
- "It's not you, it's me."

55:32.326 --> 55:34.326
And the guy
you're sleeping with at work.

55:34.446 --> 55:35.406
Just give it
to me straight,

55:35.526 --> 55:36.966
like
a pear cider

55:37.046 --> 55:38.926
that's made from 100% pears.

55:39.006 --> 55:39.966
The only fruit

55:40.086 --> 55:41.966
that goes into
a Magners Pear cider

55:42.046 --> 55:43.046
is pear.
