WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:04.705
Previously on Empire...
Lola wanted to
meet her daddy.

00:04.738 --> 00:05.973
HAKEEM:
I'm very excited to be

00:06.006 --> 00:07.708
the new chief executive officer

00:07.741 --> 00:08.809
of Empire Enterprises.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.711
Will you marry me?
Yes.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.012
You got to tell the truth.

00:12.046 --> 00:12.813
Why?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.248
Because I did 17 years

00:14.282 --> 00:16.884
for a man whose real name
I didn't even know.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.352
ANDRE:
Was my grandmother bipolar?

00:18.386 --> 00:21.089
LUCIOUS: I was embarrassed
by her, the same way

00:21.122 --> 00:22.923
I'm embarrassed by you.
To hell with you.

00:22.956 --> 00:25.025
(crying):
I just can't take it anymore.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.560
Stay with me
for as long as you need.

00:26.594 --> 00:27.728
How you doing, Ms. Cookie?

00:27.761 --> 00:29.430
I thought you'd be
working with Lucious.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.899
She was till he iced
her out the video.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.067
COOKIE:
Freda,

00:33.101 --> 00:34.835
did you say something
about Frank Gathers?

00:34.868 --> 00:35.903
Yeah, that's my father.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.105
Was my father.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.406
He got murdered in prison.

00:41.242 --> 00:44.112
("Pop Off" by Foolish playing)

00:46.214 --> 00:47.748
* You don't wanna

00:47.781 --> 00:49.617
* Yeah

00:49.650 --> 00:51.685
* Pop off, you don't
wanna pop off... *

00:51.719 --> 00:53.020
WOMAN:
Lola, get the ball.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.021
* Getting knocked off

00:54.054 --> 00:55.123
* Tell them haters stop...

00:55.156 --> 00:57.525
Here you go, Lola.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.127
Your hair is so pretty.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.928
Your mom comb it
for you today?

01:00.961 --> 01:02.363
Yes.
Yeah? Here.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.265
Ow! That hurt.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.734
Sorry, sweetie.

01:06.767 --> 01:07.901
Had to do it.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.403
* Make me lay 'em down,
after that *

01:09.437 --> 01:10.704
* It's no waking,
don't make me... *

01:10.738 --> 01:12.606
RHONDA:
I love him with all my heart.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.943
I really do, but I just
cannot be in that house.

01:15.976 --> 01:17.278
Is he still having the visions?

01:17.311 --> 01:18.812
Actually...

01:18.846 --> 01:21.382
the reverend finally
realized that he does need

01:21.415 --> 01:22.616
to recalibrate his meds.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.084
Hmm.
And he has

01:24.118 --> 01:26.754
stopped insisting that somebody
pushed me down the stairs.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.289
That's a good sign.
Yeah.

01:28.322 --> 01:29.990
(doorbell rings)

01:30.023 --> 01:31.125
Okay.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.760
I'll leave you guys to it.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.795
(sighs):
All right.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.133
(door opens)
RHONDA: Hi.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.334
ANDRE: Hey.
How are you?

01:40.368 --> 01:41.635
ANDRE: I'm good.
How you doing?

01:41.669 --> 01:42.970
Good.
You look nice.

01:43.003 --> 01:43.971
Thank you.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.173
Just give me a minute.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.674
I'll be out of your hair.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.176
Oh, no, no, no, th-that's
not right, Anika.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.177
This is your place.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.511
You know, Rhonda
and I, we can...

01:50.544 --> 01:51.679
we can go for a walk.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.181
Yeah.
ANIKA:
Oh, please.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.348
My place is
your place, okay?

01:54.382 --> 01:56.049
Make yourselves at home.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.354
So, you're not staying
with the reverend?

02:02.290 --> 02:03.924
I haven't been
going to church.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.926
I'm staying at a hotel,
and I'm not off my medication,

02:05.959 --> 02:07.428
so you don't have to ask.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.630
Okay?
Why haven't you
been going to church?

02:09.663 --> 02:12.366
I been wrestling
with some issues,

02:12.400 --> 02:14.235
spiritually, and, um...

02:16.237 --> 02:18.306
...I didn't think Reverend Pryce
would understand.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.374
Why do I find that
weirdly comforting? (chuckles)

02:20.408 --> 02:21.675
Listen, what
if we just...

02:21.709 --> 02:23.377
lease an apartment?

02:23.411 --> 02:25.012
You know, just a...

02:25.045 --> 02:26.980
a small space
where we can be together.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.283
Now I'm thinking, like,
brand-new, you know, no...

02:29.317 --> 02:31.785
bad associations, no memories.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.854
Yeah, but then what?

02:33.887 --> 02:35.356
Honestly,
I don't know what.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.825
You know, I
just... (sighs)

02:37.858 --> 02:39.627
I just know that
I miss you.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.028
Yeah.
Okay? I miss us.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.129
We were a team.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.531
Yeah.
Us against the world.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.566
Ride or die, right?

02:45.599 --> 02:48.602
Yeah, well, we haven't been that
for a long time, Andre.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.773
Well, tell me what
it's gonna take.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.745
For us to be
on the same team again?

02:57.778 --> 02:59.713
That's right.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.151
I think that we need
to want the same thing.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.354
When were you happiest?

03:06.387 --> 03:11.525
When... we were excited
about our future, I guess,

03:11.559 --> 03:15.896
and wanted to rule the world
and take over Empire.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.265
(Anika retching, coughing)

03:17.298 --> 03:18.999
Oh, my God. Whoa.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.668
(retching, coughing)

03:20.701 --> 03:23.604
Anika? Oh, my God,
are you okay?

03:23.637 --> 03:25.105
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.707
Do you think it was
something that we ate?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.175
I feel fine.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.378
No, it wasn't anything we ate.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.780
Well, what do you think
it... it is?

03:32.813 --> 03:35.549
I cannot.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.818
Especially not after
what happened to you guys.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.791
Are you pregnant?

03:47.395 --> 03:49.463
Who's the father?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.570
(whispers):
Boy.

03:56.604 --> 03:59.172
(sighs) It's Hakeem.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.812
*

04:09.817 --> 04:12.219
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

04:12.252 --> 04:14.154
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

04:14.187 --> 04:16.924
* From the bottom I got up
to the top of the pros *

04:16.957 --> 04:18.158
* From the gutter
to the shutter *

04:18.191 --> 04:19.293
* Trimmed out in gold

04:19.327 --> 04:20.628
* Life bless my soul...

04:20.661 --> 04:22.996
Lucious, your video
is amazing.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.097
(chuckles)

04:24.131 --> 04:26.334
It's so gritty,
so real.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.635
(sighs)

04:27.668 --> 04:30.671
The whole music business,
the whole world--

04:30.704 --> 04:34.308
all anyone is talking about
is little Dwight Walker.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.076
A.K.A. my boy.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.911
My man. Thank you for coming.
(laughs)

04:37.945 --> 04:39.747
Lucious Lyon, wouldn't miss it.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.981
You know,
that's the Lucious Lyon

04:41.014 --> 04:42.450
that inspired me
to buy into Empire

04:42.483 --> 04:44.518
years before he took
the company public.

04:44.552 --> 04:47.154
Look, I know I speak for all
the majority shareholders

04:47.187 --> 04:50.658
when I say...
we want you back in charge.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.825
Hear, hear.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.160
Look, I'll tell you one thing,

04:53.193 --> 04:55.095
I really appreciate
the vote of confidence,

04:55.128 --> 04:57.097
but the board has spoken.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.633
They've anointed Hakeem, and
all I can do is support that.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.536
The board answers
to the shareholders.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.372
Besides, Hakeem's support was

05:04.405 --> 05:06.173
entirely predicated on
Mimi Whiteman.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.976
May she rest in peace.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.311
But you know what,

05:11.345 --> 05:13.347
after hearing
you guys' thoughts...

05:13.381 --> 05:16.617
I'm gonna think about it
long and hard.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.887
If the board
calls on me to serve,

05:19.920 --> 05:22.656
I will consider it.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.292
We're counting on you, Lucious.
Empire needs you.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.160
Nobody else can do what you do.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.196
THIRSTY:
You're right about that.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.599
I'll take care of it.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.706
LUCIOUS:
I am so impressed with you.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.907
WOMAN:
Well, thank you.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.142
So, when do we get
to talk again?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.744
Well, just call me,

05:43.777 --> 05:45.178
and we'll arrange.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.881
Well, I'd love to put some
of your thoughts to work.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.650
Let's do that.
Have a great night.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.319
Yeah, I'm sure you
already did that.
You, too.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.221
You know, you done
crossed a line.

05:54.254 --> 05:57.357
I mean, you really crossed
a line this time, Lucious.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.595
What you doing up in here
with all these white people?

06:01.629 --> 06:04.064
Winning their hearts
and minds, my dear.

06:04.097 --> 06:07.267
Yeah, it sounds like
you winning something else.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.736
You sound a
little jealous.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.337
Oh, please,
stop flattering yourself.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.840
I'm here because
I want to make sure

06:12.873 --> 06:14.542
if you do something
against Hakeem

06:14.575 --> 06:16.577
at that shareholders meeting
that you tell me,

06:16.610 --> 06:19.379
'cause I'm trying to bring
this family back together.

06:19.413 --> 06:20.748
(sighs)

06:20.781 --> 06:22.450
Okay, how did I
cross the line?

06:22.483 --> 06:24.552
Uh, Freda Gatz?

06:24.585 --> 06:26.787
Excuse me, Gathers.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.525
She's not a problem.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.093
(quietly):
You killed her father.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.062
I don't know what
you're talking about,

06:35.095 --> 06:37.431
but I was nowhere
near that man when he died,

06:37.465 --> 06:40.033
and you are bone deep with me.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.737
I don't want that
dangerous bitch around my boys.

06:43.771 --> 06:47.608
* I know
they know I gotta lotta *

06:47.641 --> 06:50.277
* I'm in that VIP
with 50 bottles *

06:50.310 --> 06:52.245
* And all these women
foreign *

06:52.279 --> 06:54.114
* What's the motto?

06:54.147 --> 06:56.316
* What happens here,
we gon' leave it here *

06:56.349 --> 06:57.818
* So don't mention
that tomorrow *

06:57.851 --> 06:59.252
* Livin' that luxury

06:59.286 --> 07:01.789
* 'Cause where we come
from close to hell... *

07:01.822 --> 07:03.557
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.626
* Tonight Death come for me

07:05.659 --> 07:07.828

07:07.861 --> 07:09.730
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Wait, listen.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.132
* Livin' like my last night

07:12.165 --> 07:13.801
* Hey, my last night

07:13.834 --> 07:15.636
* Like my last night, oh

07:15.669 --> 07:16.937
* My last night

07:16.970 --> 07:18.739
* Like my last night...
Yo, son.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.407
Please tell me that's the hook.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.975
That's it right there.
You know, I'm-a put that

07:22.009 --> 07:23.410
as the last song on
the Black and White album.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.112
No, no, no, no.
What about "Shine on Me"?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.647
Nah, nah, nah, that, too.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.248
I'm saying, I'm-a set up
the recording session.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.183
So you telling me
I'm on two tracks on the album?

07:30.217 --> 07:31.318
Yeah, that's what
I'm telling you.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.986
Oh, we lit!
That's what I said.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.688
(Jamal chuckling)
Oh, man.

07:34.722 --> 07:35.789
Yeah, let me know.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.357
All right.
Yo, peace, man.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.792
All right.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.093
BARBER:

07:40.127 --> 07:42.029
Can't sit there.
You know the rules, bro.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.330
It's the old man's chair.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.765
Ain't nowhere else
to sit though.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.299
Y'all past ridiculous

07:46.333 --> 07:48.936

Frank Gathers, man.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.437

07:50.470 --> 07:52.105
Hey, what you say?

07:52.139 --> 07:54.942
I mean, for real,

07:54.975 --> 07:56.109
Gathers been dead, so...

07:56.143 --> 07:57.611
Yo, what part of
"Don't sit there"

07:57.645 --> 07:58.612
don't you understand?

07:58.646 --> 07:59.947
Yo, that's her pops, man.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.181
Hey, hey, come on,

Ain't no relaxing!

08:02.516 --> 08:03.450
I told you,
don't sit there!

08:03.483 --> 08:06.019
Don't... sit... there!

08:06.053 --> 08:07.120
(grunting)

08:07.154 --> 08:08.522
Get him up out

Hey, man!

08:30.043 --> 08:32.145
* We gon' feel it
in the mornin' *

08:32.179 --> 08:33.981
* Too turnt up, we goin' in

08:34.014 --> 08:35.048
* Mix that...
(music stops)

08:35.082 --> 08:36.183
Yes!

08:36.216 --> 08:38.385
That was so dope!

08:38.418 --> 08:40.588
Yo, you and Freda are like
Ri-Ri and Eminem in reverse.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.922
Oh, my goodness.
Y'all about to kill it.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.490
You got a hit, boy!

08:43.523 --> 08:44.825
Ma.

08:44.858 --> 08:45.826
It's dope, right?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.895
Yeah, it's a'ight.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.763
You're not serious.
Look...

08:49.797 --> 08:51.665
I'm not saying
the song's not cool.

08:51.699 --> 08:52.833
I-I'm just saying

08:52.866 --> 08:55.936
that I know you did this
track with Freda Gatz

08:55.969 --> 08:57.237
to get at your father.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.338
That's all I'm saying.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.873
JAMAL:
I can't lie about that,

08:59.907 --> 09:01.609
but...

09:01.642 --> 09:03.844
I'm not trying
to just get at him.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.079
I'm trying to blow past him,
which is why

09:06.113 --> 09:08.248
the Black and Whi album needs
to be released before the ASAs.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.349
Right.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.684
But all anyone's talking about

09:10.718 --> 09:12.920
right now is Lucious's

09:12.953 --> 09:14.922
Dwight Walker video.
Right? Am I wrong?

09:14.955 --> 09:17.024
I mean, I just don't know
how you gonna do it with that

09:17.057 --> 09:19.192
Freda Gatz girl,
but good luck!
Ma, you wrong, you wrong.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.228
Oh, I'm wrong? I'm wrong?
Okay, wait.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.462
I'm wrong?
Okay, okay,
a'ight, a'ight.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.764
Ain't never wrong.
A'ight, a'ight.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.132
But come on, all of the stories

09:25.165 --> 09:26.867
that you told me about
Lucious being in his zone.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.301
Mm-hmm.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.537
Y'all losing track of time when
you were creating his classics.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.672
That's what me and Freda have.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.908
Fine, Jamal, fine.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.476
You-you got it
all under control,

09:36.509 --> 09:37.978
but you need to tweak that

09:38.011 --> 09:39.046
'cause it's not 100, baby.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.649
All right.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.817
HAKEEM: And then
I'm-a have Cookie speak on

09:43.851 --> 09:46.286
where she's going with all the
Empire music divisions, okay?

09:46.319 --> 09:47.788
Why ain't she here?

09:47.821 --> 09:49.957
I told you, she's trying
to get Tiana back to perform.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.059
Okay, good. Steve and Chicken,
why don't y'all run the stats

09:52.092 --> 09:53.260
on the fashion pre-orders, so...

09:53.293 --> 09:54.294
(knocking at door)

09:54.327 --> 09:55.829
JAMAL:
Dre.

09:55.863 --> 09:56.997
Bro, you made it.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.265
Hey.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.067
Chicken, um, give us a few.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.235
Yeah, Steve and I will go over
the stats for the fashion show.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.271
Yeah, no problem.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.943
Baby brother.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.111
My man.
Good?

10:11.144 --> 10:12.112
Yeah, yeah.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.180
You sure you're
all right?

10:13.213 --> 10:14.948
I'm-I'm good.

10:14.982 --> 10:18.952
I been... I been staying at
a... hotel, but I'm-I'm good.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.487
Talk to Rhonda?

10:20.520 --> 10:22.823
We're talking.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.992
But, hey, listen, I, um...

10:25.025 --> 10:27.828
I want to let you guys know
that I'm-I'm... I'm back.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.463
Okay? I'm on board
for the shareholders meeting.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.666
I'll, uh,
do the CFO presentation

10:32.700 --> 10:34.534
and, uh, I'll help you
and Cookie prepare.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.970
Now you know you got to bring
your A-game, right?

10:37.004 --> 10:38.839
I know. But are you okay?

10:38.872 --> 10:40.607
I'm all good, baby brother.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.444
Have you, um, talked to...?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.180
Lucious and I
actually just spoke.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.448
Yeah?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.450
Yeah.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.052
Was he groveling at your feet?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.653
(chuckles)

10:53.687 --> 10:55.222
You better not have apologized.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.290
I'm onto his games, Jamal.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.459
All right, the old
man wants to talk,

10:59.492 --> 11:02.896
and I'm ready to listen,
so, uh...

11:02.930 --> 11:04.898
Tell me what you got planned.
What's up?

11:04.932 --> 11:06.333
Hey, check this out.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.802
So, Mom is bringing out
Tiana to perform, right?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.838
So, what you think about
J Poppa coming out

11:10.871 --> 11:12.672
to perform for
the churchgoing folk?

11:12.706 --> 11:13.907
It was Becky idea.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.342
That's a smart idea.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.509
But the shareholders meeting

11:16.543 --> 11:18.311
is more than just a show,
all right?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.647
It's an opportunity
for management to engage

11:20.680 --> 11:22.015
in a face-to-face dialogue

11:22.049 --> 11:23.216
with the shareholders.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.853
And the shareholders
will engage.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.154
I guarantee you that, okay?

11:27.187 --> 11:31.224
These meetings-- one wrong word,
one wrong number,

11:31.258 --> 11:32.993
they get hostile fast.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.929
So your message about all of
Empire has got to be on point.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.597
You understand?

11:37.630 --> 11:39.767
Lucious is gonna be
a challenge for you.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.869
I don't want him there.
He's a shareholder,
all right?

11:41.902 --> 11:44.271
Anybody with even one share in
the company is free to attend.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.338
And you should know,

11:45.372 --> 11:47.407
to the shareholders,
big or small,

11:47.440 --> 11:49.242
he's still the face of Empire.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.511
Especially now with
the whole Dwight Walker video.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.447
He's got a whole new
surge of support, so...

11:54.481 --> 11:57.117
he's definitely
gonna come for you.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.586
So what should I do?

11:59.619 --> 12:01.054
Let's review
any pending deals you have.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.356
Which is most important to you?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.592
Well, I got this
capsule deal with Saks

12:05.625 --> 12:06.894
I did with Antony & Cleopatra.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.361
It's gonna be big
for the company.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.798
That's what he'll go after.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.466
(sighs)

12:13.500 --> 12:15.502
*

12:19.172 --> 12:20.774
All right,
fellas, remember,

12:20.808 --> 12:22.075
my ass is out here, okay?

12:22.109 --> 12:23.610
Let's make this clean,
quick and pretty.

12:23.643 --> 12:26.046
* Red and black J,
lookin' like a ballplayer *

12:26.079 --> 12:28.415
* Pimpin' like I'm Motown,
rockin' all gator *

12:28.448 --> 12:30.083
* Baby, have you ever
seen a black card? *

12:30.117 --> 12:31.618
* I'm livin' good,
countin' money in the backyard *

12:31.651 --> 12:33.120
* Pay it up

12:33.153 --> 12:35.222
* The city wit' me on that thug,
I'm the mayor of it *

12:35.255 --> 12:37.457
* A young getter gettin',
givin' 'em the flavor lovin' *

12:37.490 --> 12:39.559
* Every little bit
of that dope, boy *

12:39.592 --> 12:42.295
* Time to pay it up,
gimme that dough, boy *

12:42.329 --> 12:44.664
* What you got up in
your pockets is a joke *

12:44.697 --> 12:46.333
* Throwin' racks,
show me somethin' *

12:46.366 --> 12:47.634
* Throw it back

12:47.667 --> 12:49.837
* We shuttin' down
the club, boy *

12:49.870 --> 12:51.304
* You ain't know that you was
messin' with a thug, boy. *

12:56.977 --> 12:58.445
You think I don't know
it was you

12:58.478 --> 13:00.981
who ran up in my warehouse
with your boys?

13:01.014 --> 13:04.351
So now my warehouse
is your warehouse,

13:04.384 --> 13:06.319
not Empire's.

13:06.353 --> 13:07.754
But of course,

13:07.787 --> 13:09.456
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.958
You gonna give me
all my Empire

13:10.991 --> 13:14.361
Antony & Cleopatra merchandise
before the shareholders meeting,

13:14.394 --> 13:16.796
or all the security footage
is going to the police.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.869
I wrote a song in the joint
about people like you

13:21.902 --> 13:24.671
called "Snitch Bitch."

13:24.704 --> 13:28.175
But of course, we don't
drop dimes in this family.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.210
You gonna take me
out like Jamal?

13:30.243 --> 13:32.212
Or treat me
like garbage like Dre?

13:32.245 --> 13:33.780
But know one thing, old man,

13:33.813 --> 13:36.383
I ain't never
bowing down to you.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.719
I thought you might say
something like that.

13:39.752 --> 13:40.988
(phone ringing)

13:44.257 --> 13:46.326
You might want to answer that.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.465
Hello.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.401
There's no equipment,
like, nothing.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.403
No lights, no... no instruments.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.338
The only thing
that's here is wardrobe.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.572
What? What happened?

13:59.606 --> 14:01.975
The roadies got stopped
and searched on the way here.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.512
The police found drugs
and confiscated everything.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.514
All right, I'm-a hit you back.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.551
Dude, you planted drugs
on my trucks?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.853
What if I did?

14:13.887 --> 14:16.256
It's just a
simple boss move.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.992
I mean, any half-assed CEO
should know how to...

14:19.026 --> 14:20.693
clap back.

14:20.727 --> 14:24.464
But... you don't bow down.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.868
(hip-hop beat playing)

14:36.609 --> 14:39.412
MAN:
There we go.

14:39.446 --> 14:42.415
COOKIE:
Damn, that's fire, Mal.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.750
That's for you
and Freda, huh?

14:43.783 --> 14:45.018
Mm-hmm.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.253
Well, you weren't lying
when you said

14:46.286 --> 14:47.687
you was gonna knock
your father off.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.189
Look, Ma, I know
that you are somehow

14:49.222 --> 14:51.424
caught up in his web right now,
so if you are coming

14:51.458 --> 14:53.093
to tell me to pump my brakes,
just please...

14:53.126 --> 14:55.395
That's not what
I'm here to tell you.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.430
I think competition
is healthy.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.567
As long as you're using it
to push yourself.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.038
So what's up?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.606
Nothing. Never mind.

15:06.639 --> 15:10.043
I... had a surprise for you,
but you got it under control.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.778
I'm sure you and Freda
got what it takes

15:11.811 --> 15:14.381
to knock Lucious
off his throne.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.649
Oh, my good-- Ma.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.720
Come on, what is it?

15:20.753 --> 15:25.058
Well, it's just that
I set you up with a certain...

15:25.092 --> 15:29.162
high-profile celebrity
superstar emcee who just broke

15:29.196 --> 15:31.564
all kinds of records
with her single

15:31.598 --> 15:35.302
by doing 2.3 million downloads
in one day.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.271
You did not get Stacee Run-Run.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.476
Get the hell up out of here.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.811
COOKIE:
Hey!
Cookie.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.079
I can't believe this.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.580
Oh, hell yeah, you can.
(chuckles)

15:47.614 --> 15:49.016
How you doing?
Good.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.817
Believe it or not,

15:50.850 --> 15:53.586
couple years ago, I crept up
in the Incognito Coffee House

15:53.620 --> 15:55.755
on Bleeker Street,
and I caught your show.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.691
And I knew right then,
yo' ass was gonna blow sky high.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.160
Thank you so much.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.594
Congratulations
on everything.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.862
STACEE:
Thank you.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.697
I can't wait to get them
into the studio.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.499
It's gonna be sick.
We'll lay down the music

16:06.533 --> 16:07.700
and record verses
tomorrow.
Mm-hmm.

16:07.734 --> 16:08.968
Stacee wants Auto-Tune.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.270
You're good with that?
I'm good with that.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.271
Also, Stacee sings
the bridge, and...

16:11.304 --> 16:12.339
I'm good with
all of that.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.174
I just want the promos.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.043
Well, I'm-a personally
promote our song

16:16.076 --> 16:18.611
on every public appearance
I have leading up to the ASAs.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.447
My Twitter and my 'grams.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.115
And she'll shout-out
the Black and Whi album

16:22.149 --> 16:24.184
every chance she gets.
Yes!

16:24.217 --> 16:26.119
JAMAL: Maybe we should rethink
the sequence of the tracks,

16:26.153 --> 16:27.520
you know what
I'm saying, like,

16:27.554 --> 16:29.522
so that this can get
the upfront shine.
COOKIE: Okay.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.358
You know, maybe move Freda
to three and seven.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.792
I thought we killed that.

16:32.825 --> 16:33.960
Killed what?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.895
Uh, look,
give us a second.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.564
Help yourself
to some snacks.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.600
Come here, let me talk
to you for a second.

16:41.901 --> 16:43.703
Uh, look...
(clears throat)
Mom?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.372
I just found out
that Stacee has

16:45.405 --> 16:48.075
an exclusivity clause
in her contract,

16:48.108 --> 16:52.011
so... no other female rapper
can be on your album.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.381
Ma, I can't just dump Freda.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.583
It's not me, baby,
it's Stacee.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.518
Look, you're the one stressing

16:58.551 --> 17:00.853
'cause you want to drop
your album before the ASAs.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.222
I'm just trying to help you.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.391
Two tracks with Stacee Run-Run?

17:04.424 --> 17:07.094
Boy, you will give Lucious
a run-run for his money.

17:09.462 --> 17:13.266
LUCIOUS: Son, say hello to your
grandmother, Leah Mary Walker.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.268
ANDRE: I don't know
what to say to her.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.903
Whatever you got to say,
say it quickly.

17:16.936 --> 17:17.937
It's cold out here.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.908
You know, the funny
thing about my mama,

17:21.941 --> 17:24.777
you'd never know who
was gonna answer back.

17:24.811 --> 17:28.615
Some days, it was this...

17:28.648 --> 17:32.285
terrifying and abusive woman.

17:32.319 --> 17:35.588
But, hell, what I remember
most about my mama

17:35.622 --> 17:38.858
was how she could make
the sun come up at midnight.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.861
Yeah, that's exactly
how Rhonda describes

17:41.894 --> 17:43.563
what it's like
to live with me.

17:48.668 --> 17:49.636
(clears throat)

17:49.669 --> 17:51.304
Hi, Grandma. It's Andre.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.106
I'm-I'm your oldest grandson.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.642
(sighs)

17:55.675 --> 17:57.677
I wish I could've
met you.

17:59.412 --> 18:03.049
Medical science has
made things more hopeful

18:03.082 --> 18:05.452
for people like us.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.220
If you were still
here with us,

18:07.254 --> 18:08.955
today you could stand a chance

18:08.988 --> 18:12.625
of being whoever
you dreamed of being...

18:12.659 --> 18:15.695
on your good days.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.133
Wish she could have
met you, too, man.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.968
Really proud of you, son.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.637
You know, whenever you say that,
you have an agenda, so...

18:24.671 --> 18:26.806
I mean it.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.808
Yeah, there's a lot
of things I'm trying

18:28.841 --> 18:30.009
to accomplish right now

18:30.042 --> 18:31.644
that I could use
your help with, but...

18:31.678 --> 18:33.246
I'm not going against
my brothers.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.748
I'm not asking you to go
against your Christian faith.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.851
I know you live by
the straight and narrow.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.155
What, you don't?

18:42.189 --> 18:45.024
I'm not...

18:45.057 --> 18:47.194
I'm not sure.

18:49.396 --> 18:52.365
Look, I understand.

18:52.399 --> 18:55.335
You know, how can you
worship some God

18:55.368 --> 18:57.837
that let your babies die, or...

18:57.870 --> 19:00.006
war and hunger.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.708
Look, at the end of the day,

19:01.741 --> 19:04.277
you got to have faith
in yourself.

19:04.311 --> 19:09.282
'Cause you the one that pull
you up out of the lion's den.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.851
I know you
and your brothers,

19:11.884 --> 19:13.853
y'all all want
the same thing I want,

19:13.886 --> 19:16.289
and that's for
our Empire to be great,

19:16.323 --> 19:19.025
but you know that
I'm the best man for that.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.494
I want us all to
try to be better.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.866
Being that woman's son...

19:26.899 --> 19:30.470
gave me a whole lot
of gifts, man.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.273
But she also did
a lot of damage to me.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.811
But I know you and me
working together,

19:38.845 --> 19:41.681
man, we could fix
a whole lot of that stuff.

19:41.714 --> 19:45.452
So what do you say?
We good?

19:54.126 --> 19:56.162
So exactly why is the new
fashion line being delayed?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.697
It's not being delayed.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.165
It's being refined
based on testing, people.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.067
No, no.
You can't say that.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.170
That makes it sound like the
clothes did bad on the test.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.939
Or I can say my dad
stole them to sabotage me.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.075
No, you will not
say that either.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.744
Just say there's been some minor
factory delays and the line

20:11.778 --> 20:12.912
will still be in stores
by Christmas.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.514
Nah, nah, man.
I just told you,

20:14.547 --> 20:16.516
I need something to announce
to blow everybody away.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.117
So where's Dre at?

20:18.150 --> 20:19.752
He's supposed to prep me
with the Swiftstream thing.

20:19.786 --> 20:23.089
STEVE: Andre said there's been
a hiccup with the app.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.258
He has our tech team solving it,
but it messed with

20:25.292 --> 20:26.959
the first quarter
numbers, so...

20:26.993 --> 20:30.096
you can't bring up profits
because we don't have any yet.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.631
Tell Dad to back the hell off.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.099
Okay, all right, hey.

20:33.132 --> 20:34.534
Can y'all give us
five minutes, please?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.269
Thank you, I'm sorry.
HAKEEM: Ten minutes.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.304
Okay.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.278
Look, (sighs)

20:45.312 --> 20:46.646
I doubt your father
had anything to do with it.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.047
Whose side are you on?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.982
I'm not on anybody's
side, Hak--

20:50.016 --> 20:52.319
Would you sit
down, please?

20:54.587 --> 20:57.457
All I ever want is what's
best for my family,

20:57.490 --> 20:59.459
and right now,
that is you killing it

20:59.492 --> 21:01.093
at the shareholders meeting.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.963
And if you are the man
for the job, then you have

21:03.996 --> 21:05.732
my support, 1,000%.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.833
But you really need

21:06.866 --> 21:08.468
to get your
act together,

21:08.501 --> 21:10.570
'cause you getting emotional
in these meetings,

21:10.603 --> 21:11.804
it's childish.

21:11.838 --> 21:12.905
Get it together.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.574
Can't be exploding
in meetings.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.476
* I'll be gone,
just keep on sippin' *

21:16.509 --> 21:19.078
* We gon' feel it
in the mornin' *

21:19.111 --> 21:21.180
* Too turnt up, we goin' in

21:21.213 --> 21:22.749
* Mix that purple
with that yellow *

21:22.782 --> 21:24.784
* Kobe Bryant for the win

21:24.817 --> 21:27.119
* I know they know
I gotta lot of *

21:27.153 --> 21:30.089
* I'm in that VIP
with 50 bottles *

21:30.122 --> 21:32.992
* And all these women foreign,
what's the motto? *

21:33.025 --> 21:35.328
* What happens here,
we gon' leave it here *

21:35.362 --> 21:37.096
* So don't mention
that tomorrow *

21:37.129 --> 21:39.332
* We livin' that luxury...
(music stops)

21:39.366 --> 21:40.700
What's up, bro?

21:40.733 --> 21:41.868
Yo, that's dope.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.670
Yeah, just tightening up
this verse a little bit.

21:43.703 --> 21:44.671
You feeling it?

21:44.704 --> 21:46.839
Yeah, it's hard.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.475
Let's just hope it flies
with Mama Cookie.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.477
(chuckles):
Yeah.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.512
Look, Freda, I got to talk
to you about something.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.180
For sure. What's up?

21:54.213 --> 21:57.016
Well, Mama Cookie...
(chuckles)

21:57.049 --> 21:59.552
set me up, uh, to do a song
with Stacee Run-Run

21:59.586 --> 22:01.187
for the Black
and White album.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.189
Bro, that is big!

22:03.222 --> 22:05.224
That chick is official status
right there!

22:05.257 --> 22:06.893
Yeah.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.895
Only thing is,
is that she got me

22:08.928 --> 22:10.563
on this exclusivity thing,

22:10.597 --> 22:13.666
so I got to choose
between her or you.

22:18.204 --> 22:21.140
It's cool.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.209
I mean, I don't want
to stop what we doing.

22:23.242 --> 22:25.378
I mean, 'cause it's pure magic.
It's just, you know,

22:25.412 --> 22:27.580
with everything that
I'm up against with my dad...

22:27.614 --> 22:28.981
Look, man, I get it.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.983
Stacee Run-Run's spit game
is next level.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.220
She hot across the world.

22:34.253 --> 22:36.389
You can't choose me over her.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.558
Hey, look, I promise you
that after I'm done,

22:38.591 --> 22:40.993
then... we'll pick up
where we left off.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.262
Come on, man, it ain't no need
to make promises.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.565
Just do you and win.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.600
Ain't that the point
of all this?

22:51.771 --> 22:53.573
ANDRE:
Yesterday, I told Dad

22:53.606 --> 22:55.842
I wanted us all
to try to be better.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.745
So... we all know

22:58.778 --> 23:00.747
that sometimes
this family

23:00.780 --> 23:02.749
doesn't treat people
as well as we should.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.517
But I've seen that
we can change,

23:04.551 --> 23:06.018
that we can rise above our past,

23:06.052 --> 23:08.020
and I'm hoping
that we can do that today,

23:08.054 --> 23:09.622
because there's someone here

23:09.656 --> 23:11.424
who has something
really important to tell you.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.325
Rhonda?

23:16.963 --> 23:18.264
COOKIE:
Uh, what the hell

23:18.297 --> 23:19.432
is she doing here?!

23:19.466 --> 23:20.700
Anika.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.301
LUCIOUS: What would
this woman have to say

23:22.334 --> 23:24.871
that would be of any interest
to anybody in this family?

23:24.904 --> 23:27.940
I'm just asking
that everybody remain civil.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.510
Okay, Anika, please.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.114
I'm pregnant.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.249
So?

23:37.283 --> 23:39.452
It's Hakeem's.

23:39.486 --> 23:40.920
COOKIE:
What?!

23:40.953 --> 23:43.956
Are you that thirsty,
you trick-ass ho?!

23:43.990 --> 23:45.892
Wait, Ma.
Hold on, hold on one second.
Are you serious?!

23:45.925 --> 23:48.227
Did you know?

23:48.260 --> 23:49.896
No!

23:49.929 --> 23:52.064
Look, how I even know
the baby mine?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.066
You're the only one I've been
with after your father.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.635
COOKIE: And you want
us to believe that?

23:55.668 --> 23:57.403
ANIKA: I'm happy to do
a paternity test.

23:57.436 --> 24:01.107
So you don't know how to
use a condom, stupid?!

24:01.140 --> 24:04.577
Anika, um... you gonna keep it?

24:04.611 --> 24:06.145
I begged her to.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.980
You did what, stupid?

24:08.014 --> 24:10.583
This family has already
tragically lost an heir.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.918
This family uses the term "heir"

24:11.951 --> 24:13.352
as if we're in
a Shakespearian play.

24:13.385 --> 24:14.621
Technically,
if we're talking about heirs,

24:14.654 --> 24:15.822
we need to find Lola.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.123
No, we don't.

24:18.324 --> 24:19.692
You're not the father.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.427
How do you know that, Lucious?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.696
Had a DNA test done.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.932
Her daddy's name is,
uh, Marcus Jones.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.333
(sighs)

24:27.366 --> 24:28.334
Great.

24:28.367 --> 24:29.502
Sorry.

24:29.536 --> 24:30.703
I guess that's that, huh?

24:34.473 --> 24:36.509
Okay, little lady.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.645
What do you want?

24:40.547 --> 24:42.014
I want something very valuable,

24:42.048 --> 24:44.350
something almost
priceless.

24:44.383 --> 24:45.518
Right. So, Lucious,

24:45.552 --> 24:47.186
why don't you just write
this bitch a check

24:47.219 --> 24:48.655
so she can get up out of here.

24:48.688 --> 24:49.889
Cookie, please.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.191
Let her finish.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.026
I want my child
to have a family.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.862
(sighs):
Girl, bye.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.730
ANIKA:
Look, I-I know

24:57.764 --> 24:59.632
that things haven't been
pleasant among us all.

24:59.666 --> 25:04.403
And I fully recognize the
role that I played in that.

25:04.436 --> 25:09.909
I am taking full responsibility
for my actions.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.480
(sighs) I'm sorry.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.649
I'm trying to
make amends.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.184
(sighs)

25:18.217 --> 25:22.021
I hope that you will
all think about it.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.940
ANNOUNCER: Empire shareholders,
please welcome Tiana!

25:40.973 --> 25:42.441
* Na, na, na, na

25:42.474 --> 25:45.578

25:45.612 --> 25:47.580

25:47.614 --> 25:49.348
* Standing on my two feet

25:49.381 --> 25:51.618
* Shake it off and let it go

25:53.152 --> 25:55.354
* Seen you from
across the room *

25:55.387 --> 25:56.689
* You look like
you got that boom *

25:56.723 --> 25:59.358
* Come and raise my tempo

25:59.391 --> 26:02.461
* I've heard it before

26:02.494 --> 26:05.564
* I don't wanna hear
anymore, no *

26:07.900 --> 26:11.570
* You got that somethin'
that I can't resist *

26:11.604 --> 26:14.140
* And I'll show you
just what it is *

26:14.173 --> 26:16.308
* Oh

26:16.342 --> 26:19.812
* It's your touch I'm cravin'

26:19.846 --> 26:21.280
* Feel the rush

26:21.313 --> 26:23.650
* Don't say a word

26:23.683 --> 26:25.317
* Oh, oh, oh

26:25.351 --> 26:27.119
* Say no words

26:27.153 --> 26:28.320
* Oh, oh, oh

26:28.354 --> 26:29.889
* Sick of talkin'

26:29.922 --> 26:31.791
* Make that body speak

26:31.824 --> 26:32.825
* Shut your mouth

26:32.859 --> 26:34.460
* Let it come naturally

26:34.493 --> 26:37.296
* Body, body *

26:37.329 --> 26:41.167
* And, baby, if you're worth it,
I'll give you lip service *

26:41.200 --> 26:42.568
* That body speak

26:42.601 --> 26:44.470
* Make that body, body speak.

26:44.503 --> 26:47.707
(crowd cheering)

27:03.522 --> 27:04.857
COOKIE:
Yes!

27:04.891 --> 27:08.995
That was Lyon Dynasty
artist Tiana,

27:09.028 --> 27:12.932
ladies and gentlemen,
fresh off of her sold-out tour.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.367
And now that
Lyon Dynasty is back

27:15.401 --> 27:18.337
under the Empire banner,
that song,

27:18.370 --> 27:20.439
which is on its way to hitting

27:20.472 --> 27:23.042
two million in sales right now,
as we speak...

27:23.075 --> 27:24.343
(crowd cheers)

27:24.376 --> 27:27.880
...only means money
in all of your pockets.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.518
So, ladies and gentlemen,
shareholders,

27:32.551 --> 27:35.554
without further ado,
I would like to introduce

27:35.587 --> 27:37.890
my son, my baby boy,

27:37.924 --> 27:40.392
and your
chief executive officer,

27:40.426 --> 27:42.461
Hakeem Lyon!

27:42.494 --> 27:44.496
(crowd cheering)

28:00.246 --> 28:02.014
(exhales)

28:02.048 --> 28:03.582
Seeing how much
you adored lions,

28:03.615 --> 28:05.718
I thought I'd bring you one.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.386
Oh, you really
didn't think

28:07.419 --> 28:08.988
you were gonna
make a surprise visit

28:09.021 --> 28:12.058
to my house,
and me not return the favor.

28:12.091 --> 28:14.493
No.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.263
Please, make yourself at home.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.697
I did.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.400
So what took you so long?

28:21.433 --> 28:24.003
Well, if I knew
you felt like that,

28:24.036 --> 28:25.571
I'd have come sooner.

28:25.604 --> 28:27.439
(chuckles)

28:29.041 --> 28:30.743
Look...

28:30.777 --> 28:34.580
I want you to take
your prenatals, get good rest,

28:34.613 --> 28:36.515
bring the baby to term.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.518
When you have it,
give it to Hakeem, and...

28:39.551 --> 28:41.520
I'm-a give you
ten million dollars.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.090
Do not be absurd, Lucious.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.591
I don't want your money.

28:45.624 --> 28:47.526
If I did,
I would think

28:47.559 --> 28:49.028
that carrying the Lyon heir
would be worth

28:49.061 --> 28:51.263
a hell of a lot more than
ten million, don't you think?

28:51.297 --> 28:52.264
What do you want?

28:52.298 --> 28:53.766
A trust fund?

28:53.800 --> 28:56.202
Big old mansion like
Rhonda and Andre got?

28:56.235 --> 28:57.203
I told you what I want.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.604
A family?

28:58.637 --> 29:02.108
If you wanted a family,
why'd you betray me?

29:02.141 --> 29:03.209
I betrayed you?

29:03.242 --> 29:05.878
I mean, sleeping
with Beretti--

29:05.912 --> 29:07.814
I could have
gotten over that.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.448
But you slept
with my baby boy,

29:09.481 --> 29:11.383
with my son.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.552
I never slept with Beretti.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.822
But it was okay to
sleep with my son?

29:15.855 --> 29:17.756
You cheated on me first!
You slept with Cookie!

29:17.790 --> 29:19.725
I was never gonna
leave you for Cookie.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.093
You broke my heart.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.629
You made me behave like
some kind of lunatic.

29:23.662 --> 29:25.497
I made you behave?

29:25.531 --> 29:27.499
Look, you can't blame me
for your actions.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.001
If you acted
like a lunatic,

29:29.035 --> 29:30.903
it's 'cause you
made those choices.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.472
Look...

29:33.505 --> 29:36.342
I done said my piece.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.476
Take my offer.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.645
It's a good one.

29:39.678 --> 29:42.548
Please, don't make
me get ugly.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.417
No, no, no.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.153
My baby-- he is making me

29:47.186 --> 29:48.821
believe in myself again,
Lucious.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.493
He?
He.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.328
And if that is something
you cannot understand,

29:56.362 --> 29:59.531
then I will have to do what I
need to do, too, just like you.

29:59.565 --> 30:02.034
What does that mean?

30:02.068 --> 30:03.702
"Do what you need to do."

30:03.735 --> 30:07.239
When the FBI was coming for you,
I never dimed on you.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.345
What could you
possibly know about me

30:13.379 --> 30:15.882
that would be of any
interest to the FBI?

30:15.915 --> 30:19.351
Five years...

30:19.385 --> 30:21.787
of being with you, Lucious.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.522
Living under your roof,

30:23.555 --> 30:26.125
working for you.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.727
I know more than you think.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.129
If I didn't
know better,

30:30.162 --> 30:32.131
I would say you're
threatening me.

30:32.164 --> 30:35.401
But I do know better.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.569
I would be very careful.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.138
You know, a lot of women,

30:39.171 --> 30:41.207
they...

30:41.240 --> 30:43.609
they don't survive childbirth.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.220
(door opens, closes)

30:54.253 --> 30:56.388
And our recent acquisition
of Swiftstream

30:56.422 --> 30:59.225
has put Empire in a position

30:59.258 --> 31:03.162
to be the world's leader
in music streaming today.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.663
(crowd cheering)

31:04.696 --> 31:06.899
Yeah.

31:06.933 --> 31:09.435
Now I'll take questions.
I know y'all got plenty.

31:09.468 --> 31:10.502
WOMAN:
Hi.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.938
Um, I'm Marti Monroe.

31:11.971 --> 31:12.939
I'm from Toledo.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.273
This is my neighbor, Olive.

31:14.306 --> 31:15.908
We have an Empire
investment group.

31:15.942 --> 31:17.609
Hey, Marti and Olive
from Toledo.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.778
What's your question?

31:19.811 --> 31:22.381
We love, love your music,
and we just want to know,

31:22.414 --> 31:25.017
why haven't you released
any new stuff lately?

31:25.051 --> 31:27.186
Well, to be honest,
I've been a little busy

31:27.219 --> 31:29.055
with Empire for
the past few months,

31:29.088 --> 31:30.356
watching after y'all money,

31:30.389 --> 31:32.258
making sure
y'all don't go broke!

31:32.291 --> 31:34.260
(crowd cheering)

31:34.293 --> 31:36.762
But I promise you, ladies,
I got music coming very soon.

31:36.795 --> 31:38.597
Very soon. Next question.

31:38.630 --> 31:41.200
LUCIOUS:
Um, over here, Mr. CEO.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.269
It's a simple one.

31:43.302 --> 31:44.270
(crowd murmuring)

31:44.303 --> 31:45.437
Y'all may know this man

31:45.471 --> 31:47.106
as Lucious Lyon,
my father.

31:47.139 --> 31:49.108
(applause)

31:49.141 --> 31:50.709
LUCIOUS:
Thank you.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.378
Thank you. It's nice to know

31:52.411 --> 31:54.313
there's still some love left
for the old man.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.815
Okay, ask your question so
other people can have a chance.

31:56.848 --> 31:57.816
Okay, okay.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.718
What do you think

31:59.751 --> 32:01.587
are the five biggest challenges

32:01.620 --> 32:04.456
facing the music industry
over the next, say,

32:04.490 --> 32:06.425
ten years?

32:14.500 --> 32:16.902
Monetizing new releases.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.072
Declining physical CD sales.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.573
I don't know, Lucious.
What, piracy?

32:21.607 --> 32:24.643
Rising ticket prices
for live shows.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.312
And an all-around lack

32:26.345 --> 32:28.314
of innovation
for the music industry.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.582
I don't know. I'll break it down
for you if you want.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.419
(laughter, applause)

32:33.452 --> 32:34.853
It's really funny
you mention

32:34.886 --> 32:36.255
live shows.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.456
Didn't Empire

32:37.489 --> 32:39.491
just scrap an
entire concert tour

32:39.525 --> 32:41.860
under your expert
leadership?

32:41.893 --> 32:44.196
Okay, if you want to talk about
that, my father actually...

32:44.230 --> 32:45.631
LUCIOUS: See,
that's where you're wrong.

32:45.664 --> 32:46.999
This isn't about me.

32:47.033 --> 32:49.868
I'm actually asking
on behalf of Clair here.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.437
Clair, baby,
please stand up.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.505
Now, Clair Templeton,

32:53.539 --> 32:56.508
she's a schoolteacher
from Dallas.
(quietly): What is this?

32:56.542 --> 33:00.012
It turns out that money
is so scarce in her district

33:00.046 --> 33:02.681
that she has to pay for
her students' school supplies

33:02.714 --> 33:04.550
out of her own pocket.

33:04.583 --> 33:08.854
Which means Clair depends
on Empire dividends,

33:08.887 --> 33:10.689
or her students
don't get an education.

33:10.722 --> 33:11.890
Am I right?

33:11.923 --> 33:13.692
You're damn
right, Lucious.

33:13.725 --> 33:14.693
(crowd murmuring)

33:14.726 --> 33:16.128
LUCIOUS:
And then, uh,

33:16.162 --> 33:17.863
Mitch here, Mr. CEO,

33:17.896 --> 33:20.366
he came all the way
from Albuquerque.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.468
Mitch was wondering
what in the world

33:22.501 --> 33:24.403
happened with
the Antony & Cleopatra

33:24.436 --> 33:26.004
clothing line that you got us

33:26.038 --> 33:27.539
so hyped up about?

33:27.573 --> 33:29.241
Well, Mitch,
there's been a slight delay.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.143
Why is that?

33:31.177 --> 33:33.011
Our warehouse was broken into.

33:33.045 --> 33:35.047
You mean a security breach,

33:35.081 --> 33:36.648
under your watch.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.317
Now, we're talking about

33:38.350 --> 33:41.720
millions of dollars
of merchandise down the drain.

33:41.753 --> 33:44.390
I mean, why wasn't
there better security?

33:44.423 --> 33:46.225
Nah, man, you can't take over
this meeting.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.060
No, I'm-I'm not taking over
your meeting, son.

33:48.094 --> 33:50.929
I'm just asking
the simple questions

33:50.962 --> 33:53.399
that any competent CEO
could answer.

33:53.432 --> 33:56.001
But I am concerned
about Swiftstream.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.070
I heard there's a problem
with the app.

33:58.104 --> 33:59.671
(crowd murmuring)

33:59.705 --> 34:02.908
Now, that's just
a temporary delay.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.043
(quietly): Did you do
what I think you did?

34:05.077 --> 34:07.246
LUCIOUS: Now we've all heard him
say how Swiftstream is...

34:07.279 --> 34:09.281
(quietly):
That's how we get back to us.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.517
...positioned to be
the leader in music streaming,

34:11.550 --> 34:13.952
but I don't know how in the
world that's ever gonna happen,

34:13.985 --> 34:16.422
if we can't even launch
the damn app.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.224
(crowd murmuring agreement)

34:19.291 --> 34:21.026
It's a temporary delay.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.961
Oh, another delay.

34:22.994 --> 34:25.731
Damn, you got a room
full of people here

34:25.764 --> 34:29.901
all waiting to hear
your vision, but instead,

34:29.935 --> 34:32.271
they're hearing delays, mishaps

34:32.304 --> 34:34.740
and mismanagement.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.308
Now, this is their meeting.

34:36.342 --> 34:37.476
Clair,

34:37.509 --> 34:38.910
tell him what you need.

34:38.944 --> 34:40.146
We need Lucious.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.480
No, no, no, no.
MAN: That's right!
Lucious!

34:41.513 --> 34:43.315
(crowd cheering)
LUCIOUS:
That's not what I meant.

34:43.349 --> 34:44.550
That's not what I meant!

34:44.583 --> 34:47.386
CROWD (chanting):
Lucious! Lucious! Lucious!

34:47.419 --> 34:49.087
(chanting continues)

34:49.121 --> 34:50.789
COOKIE:
Uh, okay.

34:50.822 --> 34:53.625
All right. Okay, okay.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.127
Everybody, settle down.

34:55.161 --> 34:56.828
Let me explain what's
happening here.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.298
What we have is

34:59.331 --> 35:02.634
two great men
fighting over Empire.

35:02.668 --> 35:06.405
They both love this
company so much

35:06.438 --> 35:08.106
that they would kill for it.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.475
And I mean that figuratively,

35:09.508 --> 35:11.577
of course.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.944
But what it means
is that

35:12.978 --> 35:14.813
they will kill it for you.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.815
And I know that's what you want.

35:16.848 --> 35:17.849
Am I right?

35:19.551 --> 35:22.488
Okay, Lucious is a legend.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.423
Can't take that
away from him.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.924
Yeah, that's right,
give it up.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.593
(applause)

35:27.626 --> 35:30.929
But my son, Hakeem,
has become a mogul

35:30.962 --> 35:32.464
in his own right.

35:32.498 --> 35:36.868
He helped me build
Lyon Dynasty from nothing,

35:36.902 --> 35:38.704
and for that
he deserves your respect.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.340
And yours, too.

35:42.841 --> 35:45.143
So why don't you come up here
and show these shareholders

35:45.177 --> 35:47.646
that you will not fight
with one another,

35:47.679 --> 35:50.482
but instead you will
fight together to make

35:50.516 --> 35:55.153
this company great like they--
like we all deserve, right?

35:55.187 --> 35:56.322
(crowd cheering)

35:56.355 --> 35:57.823
Empire was
built on family!

36:02.361 --> 36:03.895
Son.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.533
(crowd cheering)

36:09.368 --> 36:11.637
What Empire needs is you,
Cookie!

36:11.670 --> 36:12.638
Thank you.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.072
To the Empire!

36:14.105 --> 36:15.173
The Empire!

36:21.413 --> 36:22.714
*

36:32.057 --> 36:34.226
What did
the board say?

36:34.260 --> 36:36.328
They did it.
They voted me out.

36:36.362 --> 36:37.596
They like you, Mom.

36:37.629 --> 36:40.198
Come here, boy.

36:40.232 --> 36:42.734
I'm proud of you.

36:42.768 --> 36:47.005
You did the best you could
steering this mess of a ship.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.607
And you should be
proud of yourself.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.176
You can tell your kids
you ran Empire

36:51.209 --> 36:53.044
for all of ten minutes.

36:53.078 --> 36:56.248
Really?

36:56.282 --> 36:58.450
You must feel good
about yourself,

36:58.484 --> 37:01.287
humiliating him in front of
all of those people.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.021
(scoffs)

37:03.054 --> 37:05.223
You know you love me, baby.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.592
You said

37:06.625 --> 37:10.195
you wanted to bring
our family back together.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.230
Now, you know what happens
after this, right?

37:12.264 --> 37:14.232
Yeah, they come
groveling back to you

37:14.266 --> 37:15.401
like Apple did Steve Jobs.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.236
You... you are
a piece of work.

37:18.270 --> 37:19.571
Congratulations.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.251
What's up, y'all?

37:33.285 --> 37:34.620
Hey.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.423
Oh, Stacee Run-Runnin' late?

37:37.456 --> 37:39.325
(chuckles)

37:39.358 --> 37:41.259
What?

37:41.293 --> 37:42.761
She's in Tokyo,

37:42.794 --> 37:44.463
but she sent over
her pre-recorded verse,

37:44.496 --> 37:46.965
and, Jamal, it is hot! Hit it.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.468
STACEE: * They choose me,
I'm like treasure *

37:49.501 --> 37:50.636
* Maybe 'cause
I'm state-of-the-art *

37:50.669 --> 37:52.070
* On all measures

37:52.103 --> 37:53.639
* Maybe 'cause I symbolize...

37:53.672 --> 37:54.640
(music stops)

37:54.673 --> 37:55.807
When will she be back?

37:55.841 --> 37:57.609
Uh, she's in Tokyo,

37:57.643 --> 37:58.810
Jamal, as in Japan.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.145
She's on
a promotional tour,

38:00.178 --> 38:03.014
but, look, she will be back
in time for the ASAs.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.416
The ASAs?
Listen...

38:04.450 --> 38:07.453
Jamal, a lot of artists
do this, okay?

38:07.486 --> 38:10.589
Lil' Wayne is forever spitting
a hot 16 on somebody's track

38:10.622 --> 38:12.758
from the comforts
of his own tour bus.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.092
Technology.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.761
Didn't that tour bus
get shot up?

38:15.794 --> 38:17.663
Jamal, please,
don't fight with me.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.197
Just do this, okay?

38:19.230 --> 38:20.699
Ma, I'm-a do it.
Please, please, please.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.200
I'm-a do it.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.340
(sighs):
Okay.

38:30.342 --> 38:31.810
* I'm like treasure

38:31.843 --> 38:33.144
* Maybe 'cause
I'm state-of-the-art *

38:33.178 --> 38:34.813
* On all measures

38:34.846 --> 38:37.282
* Maybe 'cause I symbolize
grade-A pleasure *

38:37.315 --> 38:39.951
* Take what you want,
no playin' hard to get *

38:39.985 --> 38:41.720
* Oh, you got it like that

38:41.753 --> 38:43.021
* Well, let's see
what comes next *

38:43.054 --> 38:44.623
* Run, what you got

38:44.656 --> 38:46.992
* It's a stickup,
hands up in the air *

38:47.025 --> 38:50.328
* Are you down or what?

38:50.362 --> 38:52.297
* Are you down
or what? *

38:52.330 --> 38:53.399
* Tell me

38:53.432 --> 38:54.966
* Tell... tell me if...

38:55.000 --> 38:57.302
Jamal! Come on, baby,
you were bringing it.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.336
Come on.
I know.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.171
I just got to, I just
got to catch it.

39:00.205 --> 39:01.306
It'll be fine.
Mm-hmm.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.808
* I'm like treasure

39:02.841 --> 39:03.842
* Maybe 'cause
I'm state-of-the-art *

39:03.875 --> 39:05.343
* On all measures

39:05.377 --> 39:08.079
* Maybe 'cause I symbolize
grade-A pleasure *

39:08.113 --> 39:10.649
* Take what you want,
no playin' hard to get *

39:10.682 --> 39:12.083
* Oh, you got it like that

39:12.117 --> 39:13.819
* Well, let's see
what comes next *

39:13.852 --> 39:15.353
* Run, what you got

39:15.387 --> 39:18.590
* It's a stickup,
hands up in the air *

39:18.624 --> 39:21.359
* Are you down or what?

39:21.393 --> 39:23.529
* Are you down
or what? *

39:23.562 --> 39:25.330
* Tell me if you're ready

39:25.363 --> 39:29.935
* 'Cause I'm willing to take
what I want tonight *

39:29.968 --> 39:31.870
* Are you down or what?

39:31.903 --> 39:33.439
Ma, I'm sorry.
Like, I-I don't...

39:33.472 --> 39:35.373
I don't even want
to work like this.

39:38.276 --> 39:40.412
It is so disrespectful
for her not to even show.

39:40.446 --> 39:42.414
You are the one
who said you want

39:42.448 --> 39:44.750
to burn down this town
and leave your father

39:44.783 --> 39:46.384
crawling around
in your ashes.
O-Okay.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.454
Then, you know what,
I don't need Stacee Run-Run.

39:48.487 --> 39:51.557
You know, I was burning the city
down already with Freda Gatz.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.692
And I don't understand
why you got such a problem

39:53.725 --> 39:55.527
with what we're doing.

39:55.561 --> 39:57.295
Like, usually, we're right
on the same creative page.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.898
Jamal... (sighs)

39:59.931 --> 40:01.900
(clippers buzzing,
rap music playing quietly)

40:01.933 --> 40:04.436
(door opens, closes)

40:04.470 --> 40:06.237
MAN:
Hey, Jamal.

40:06.271 --> 40:07.606
Sup.
What's up?

40:07.639 --> 40:08.774
Yo.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.481
Listen, I don't want somebody
giving me an ultimatum.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.818
I want you on the
Black and White album.

40:19.851 --> 40:23.922
And if I got to choose between
you or someone, anyone...

40:23.955 --> 40:25.423
I'm choosing you, all right?

40:25.457 --> 40:28.126
So, what, you wasn't
feeling Stacee Run-Run?

40:28.159 --> 40:29.628
Nah, man, Stacee's cool.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.429
Her spit game is crazy.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.231
She said she used to watch me
perform at this place

40:33.264 --> 40:34.733
on Bleeker Street
called Incognito.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.968
Oh, yeah, I know that place.

40:37.002 --> 40:40.472
Couple brothers used to play
blues there on Friday night.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.943
Thanks, Freda.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.846
Look, Freda, look,
the way that we make music,

40:47.879 --> 40:50.516
that's how I used to feel when
I would perform at Incognito.

40:50.549 --> 40:54.252
I wasn't worried about
beating my dad or...

40:54.285 --> 40:56.087
winning some ASA.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.789
It was creating music

40:57.823 --> 41:00.425
for the joy of creating music,
you know?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.393
I know you know.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.465
I think I figured out
the bridge of the song.

41:07.499 --> 41:10.502
* Life ain't easy for
anybody livin' it *

41:10.536 --> 41:13.872
* Rich man, poor man,
goin' through the same thing *

41:13.905 --> 41:16.542
* If they talk about me
at the time of my death *

41:16.575 --> 41:18.209
* May they say I turnt up...

41:18.243 --> 41:19.678
(trails off)

41:22.013 --> 41:23.148
All right.

41:25.751 --> 41:29.154
Yo, maybe we could
record it tonight.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.122
You come by, that'd be cool.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.458
I'll think about it, a'ight?

41:33.491 --> 41:35.827
All right.

41:35.861 --> 41:37.563
Yeah, I'm-a just
be there all night,

41:37.596 --> 41:39.364
so it ain't no, you know...

41:39.397 --> 41:40.498
You roll through...

41:40.532 --> 41:42.668
A'ight.

41:51.777 --> 41:53.745
(doorbells jingle)

41:57.749 --> 42:00.619
(bells tolling)

42:10.962 --> 42:12.731
There you go.
That's a good one.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.232
See if you can
beat that one.

42:14.265 --> 42:16.702
Hello. Can I help you?

42:16.735 --> 42:18.536
The name is
Thurston Rawlings,

42:18.570 --> 42:20.205
regarding Leah Walker.

42:20.238 --> 42:22.708
Oh, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Rawlings.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.542
Yeah, I just stopped by
to make sure

42:24.576 --> 42:26.011
everything is
copacetic over here.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.946
Everything is
fine and dandy.

42:27.979 --> 42:29.681
Uh, would you like
to say hello to Mrs. W?

42:29.715 --> 42:30.716
No, no, no.

42:30.749 --> 42:32.383
No, no.

42:32.417 --> 42:34.085
Long as everything
is fine and dandy.

42:36.321 --> 42:38.289
I don't want to bother her.

42:38.323 --> 42:40.926
(woman humming faintly)

42:43.662 --> 42:46.665
(humming "Mona Lisa")

42:53.471 --> 42:57.976
* Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

42:58.009 --> 43:02.380
* Men have named you

43:02.413 --> 43:06.284
* You're so like the lady

43:06.317 --> 43:11.222
* With the mystic smile

43:11.256 --> 43:15.593
* Is it only
'cause you're lonely *

43:15.627 --> 43:18.496
* They have blamed you...

43:55.133 --> 43:56.668
Yeah.
