WEBVTT

00:08.214 --> 00:09.315
Come on.

00:09.316 --> 00:11.151
Come on, let's move. Okay, guys,

00:11.152 --> 00:12.896
let's get what we can and get out fast.

00:12.897 --> 00:14.103
My name is Becca Mason.

00:14.104 --> 00:15.345
My colleagues and I,

00:15.346 --> 00:17.552
with the environmental group
Ocean Relief Foundation,

00:17.553 --> 00:20.017
have managed to sneak ashore
here on Shipwreck Reef.

00:20.018 --> 00:22.353
Until recently, it was
an uninhabited atoll,

00:22.354 --> 00:24.322
home to an incredibly biodiverse

00:24.323 --> 00:25.323
coral reef.

00:25.324 --> 00:26.324
Like many such atolls,

00:26.325 --> 00:28.292
this reef is being developed

00:28.293 --> 00:29.927
by the Chinese military.

00:29.928 --> 00:32.563
And by "developed," I mean demolished.

00:32.564 --> 00:34.198
You can see the construction

00:34.199 --> 00:35.566
going on over there.

00:35.567 --> 00:37.502
To build airstrips and radar stations,

00:37.503 --> 00:38.503
they pulverize the coral

00:38.504 --> 00:40.705
and pave over it with concrete,

00:40.706 --> 00:42.406
destroying it forever.

00:42.407 --> 00:44.008
Maybe you're thinking, "So what?

00:44.009 --> 00:45.376
"Who cares about a little speck

00:45.377 --> 00:46.944
in the middle of a faraway sea?"

00:46.945 --> 00:49.380
These reefs

00:49.381 --> 00:53.184
provide one tenth of
all the seafood on Earth,

00:53.185 --> 00:54.986
providing food for millions of people.

00:56.255 --> 00:58.122
What will happen when that food is gone?

00:59.158 --> 01:00.892
We're here because someone needs to act

01:00.893 --> 01:02.426
before it's too late.

01:02.427 --> 01:05.196
We're hoping you'll see this
and that someone will be you.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.297
They're here. Let's go.

01:07.781 --> 01:08.728
_

01:08.766 --> 01:09.967
Do we have it?

01:09.968 --> 01:11.968
Wait, guys, do we have it?!

01:16.474 --> 01:19.477
- We're good.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

01:19.478 --> 01:21.145
_

01:21.146 --> 01:22.712
Becca.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.105
I just can't believe you didn't mention

01:33.106 --> 01:34.861
Ray Merchant to the FBI, that's all.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.494
I didn't think it was relevant.

01:36.495 --> 01:37.963
Elizabeth, someone is stalking

01:37.964 --> 01:39.965
our family. How could a former student

01:39.966 --> 01:42.467
who is obsessed with
you not be relevant?

01:42.468 --> 01:45.770
He just wanted me to
be his thesis advisor.

01:45.771 --> 01:48.707
He wanted you to
be a lot more than that.

01:48.708 --> 01:49.941
Okay.

01:49.942 --> 01:52.777
Admittedly, Ray got a little weird.

01:52.778 --> 01:54.346
- A lit...
- And don't say,

01:54.347 --> 01:55.947
"He got a lot more than that."

01:55.948 --> 01:57.482
- Well, he did.
- Yeah, okay.

01:57.483 --> 01:58.483
He did.

01:58.484 --> 01:59.951
He's bipolar,

01:59.952 --> 02:01.987
and the school dealt with it,

02:01.988 --> 02:05.090
and we haven't heard
anything from him since.

02:05.091 --> 02:09.494
You do remember I used to do
this kind of stuff for the CIA.

02:09.495 --> 02:11.062
Can you get your corner, please?

02:11.062 --> 02:12.864
No, I will not, and I don't appreciate

02:12.865 --> 02:14.599
how glib you're being
about this right now.

02:14.600 --> 02:17.501
That's your excuse for not helping.

02:18.370 --> 02:20.305
Okay.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.407
That... was a little glib.

02:22.408 --> 02:26.177
What did he say to you
when you turned him down?

02:26.178 --> 02:30.181
He said he wanted to
hurt himself and me.

02:30.182 --> 02:34.452
Okay, but you of all
people, you know how wound up

02:34.453 --> 02:35.787
these gifted kids can get.

02:35.788 --> 02:36.922
Exactly.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.423
Do you really think that
a brilliant young guy

02:38.424 --> 02:40.158
with a screw loose couldn't
have pulled off some of the stuff

02:40.159 --> 02:42.782
- that's been happening?
- I don't know where Ray Merchant is now,

02:42.783 --> 02:44.429
but I doubt an interview with the FBI

02:44.430 --> 02:46.064
would be very good
for his mental health.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.065
That's not my problem.

02:47.066 --> 02:49.000
The safety of our family is my problem.

02:49.001 --> 02:51.169
- A problem I caused.
- I... That's not what I meant.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.371
Yeah, but that's the truth of it, right?

02:53.372 --> 02:55.974
Someone's threatening our
kids, and it's my fault.

02:55.975 --> 02:57.575
Elizabeth, no one believes in your work,

02:57.599 --> 02:58.977
in you, more than I do.

02:58.978 --> 03:01.246
Do you know who else
is obsessed with me?

03:01.247 --> 03:04.516
Hezbollah, ISIS, the Sinaloa Cartel.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.685
Any one of them would happily murder

03:06.686 --> 03:08.429
our family if it would
further their agenda.

03:08.430 --> 03:11.256
So, you know, that's fun to live with.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.457
Listen to me.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.626
It's just that, a lot of times,

03:14.627 --> 03:16.294
stalkers have a personal relationship

03:16.295 --> 03:17.362
with their victims.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.164
I had a bad feeling about this kid then,

03:19.165 --> 03:20.148
and I still have it now.

03:20.149 --> 03:21.900
Fine.

03:21.901 --> 03:25.869
Y-You want to talk to the
FBI, you can talk to the FBI.

03:26.972 --> 03:28.139
On one condition.

03:28.140 --> 03:29.274
Name it.

03:29.275 --> 03:32.877
You have to put the
shams on the big pillows.

03:32.878 --> 03:35.914
I'm sorry, but glib is the
only way I can deal right now.

03:35.915 --> 03:38.249
Man, that's the worst
job in the whole house.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.785
Yes, I know.

03:40.786 --> 03:43.054
...and Nadine is wondering
how China's taking

03:43.055 --> 03:45.318
- of the activists from Ocean
Relief Foundation - Thanks.

03:45.319 --> 03:48.126
will impact your trip to Vietnam.

03:48.127 --> 03:50.395
You mean the Great Catfish Summit?

03:50.396 --> 03:53.264
It's a $360 million industry in the U.S.

03:53.265 --> 03:55.567
Vietnam is undercutting our
producers on the world market.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.235
Which is one of the last impediments

03:57.236 --> 03:59.771
to full normalization
between our countries.

03:59.772 --> 04:02.273
I know why I'm going, Blake.

04:02.274 --> 04:06.144
How's your Uncle Fred the
catfish farmer, by the way?

04:06.145 --> 04:07.846
E-mailing voluminously, ma'am.

04:09.115 --> 04:12.217
Ooh. In answer to,
Nadine's question,

04:12.218 --> 04:13.451
I see no reason

04:13.452 --> 04:15.620
why the Ocean Relief situation

04:15.621 --> 04:17.488
would impact my trip at this point.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.757
Daisy is getting input from the group

04:19.759 --> 04:21.625
and putting together a statement.

04:21.627 --> 04:24.529
Ooh, speaking of statements,
have the Chinese made one yet?

04:24.530 --> 04:25.563
Not as yet, no.

04:25.564 --> 04:28.133
Well, that's something.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.869
The South China Sea is one of
the most dangerous flash points

04:30.870 --> 04:32.303
on this planet.

04:32.304 --> 04:34.339
What the hell were those
kids doing out there?

04:34.340 --> 04:35.923
Protesting its destruction, apparently.

04:35.924 --> 04:37.375
Which they're not wrong about.

04:37.376 --> 04:40.145
Okay, so, for the briefing,
China's building these bases

04:40.146 --> 04:43.214
to assert its claim that it
owns the whole sea because why?

04:43.215 --> 04:44.749
- Oil and gas.
- Shipping lanes.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.084
Fishing's pretty good, too.

04:46.085 --> 04:49.087
You guys, 11 billion
proven barrels of oil

04:49.088 --> 04:50.889
underneath the SCS.
That's what China wants.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.357
What are we even talking about?

04:52.358 --> 04:54.599
Maybe they want control of
the $5 trillion worth of cargo

04:54.600 --> 04:55.943
that passes through it each year.

04:55.944 --> 04:58.763
$1.2 trillion of which
touches U.S. ports, because,

04:58.764 --> 05:00.467
you know, we buy
everything from China now.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.467
Okay, you want to play
Fun with Numbers? Here.

05:02.468 --> 05:05.804
A population of 1.3 billion
with one of the world's

05:05.805 --> 05:07.939
largest fisheries in its backyard.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.141
- All I'm saying.
- And don't forget to note

05:10.142 --> 05:11.805
that tensions have
been rising dangerously

05:11.806 --> 05:13.445
not just with the U.S. but with all

05:13.446 --> 05:14.749
of China's neighbors on the sea.

05:14.750 --> 05:15.814
It's a real powder keg.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.882
God, what the hell were
those kids doing out there?

05:17.883 --> 05:19.918
- Exactly.
- Good luck with the briefing.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.853
Well, with any luck, we might not have

05:21.854 --> 05:23.388
to do a briefing at all.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.290
The Chinese haven't even
released a statement.

05:25.291 --> 05:28.226
I'm sure they're not looking
to set off a confrontation

05:28.227 --> 05:30.261
over an incident this small.

05:30.262 --> 05:31.996
Besides, Chen and I have
a pretty good relationship.

05:31.997 --> 05:33.431
I'm sure we can sort this out.

05:33.432 --> 05:35.095
I have the foreign
minister ready for you.

05:35.096 --> 05:36.301
- Great. Thank you.
- Yeah.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.136
Madam Secretary.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.705
I wanted to reach out to
you about this situation

05:40.706 --> 05:42.607
with the activists because

05:42.608 --> 05:44.476
I think it's in both our interests

05:44.477 --> 05:47.712
to resolve this...
misunderstanding quickly.

05:47.713 --> 05:50.682
- I agree.
- Good. So where do we start?

05:50.683 --> 05:52.617
Simply acknowledge that
they were trespassing

05:52.618 --> 05:53.885
on Chinese territory,

05:53.886 --> 05:56.488
- and we can go from there.
- Well, obviously,

05:56.489 --> 05:58.957
I'm not gonna do that.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.225
Not one country

06:00.226 --> 06:02.427
in the world, mine included,

06:02.428 --> 06:05.530
recognizes the territorial
claims China is making

06:05.531 --> 06:07.165
in the South China Sea.

06:07.166 --> 06:10.001
Then the Western spies we apprehended

06:10.002 --> 06:12.670
will be tried for
trespassing on our island.

06:12.671 --> 06:15.540
Not only is it not your island,

06:15.541 --> 06:18.409
it's not even an island.

06:18.410 --> 06:22.347
It's a coral atoll you
illegally annexed and paved over.

06:22.348 --> 06:24.516
And, furthermore, "spies"?

06:24.517 --> 06:26.918
Really? Come on, Ming.

06:26.919 --> 06:29.988
We've worked closely together
on a range of incredibly

06:29.989 --> 06:31.089
complex issues.

06:31.090 --> 06:34.559
I think we can handle
some hippies on a raft.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.394
I believe I've made
China's position clear.

06:36.395 --> 06:39.797
You would be wise not to meddle
further in our internal affairs.

06:39.798 --> 06:42.100
Then let me be equally clear:

06:42.101 --> 06:45.003
Those activists were
taken on disputed territory

06:45.004 --> 06:46.938
and, therefore, illegally.

06:46.939 --> 06:49.607
We want them released immediately.

06:49.608 --> 06:51.609
It seems we have nothing
further to discuss.

06:51.610 --> 06:53.645
Good day, Madam Secretary.

06:53.646 --> 06:54.979
Wow.

06:54.980 --> 06:56.713
Ming out.

06:57.649 --> 06:59.017
Right?

06:59.018 --> 07:00.818
What the hell was that?

07:00.819 --> 07:03.521
Your motorcade is waiting to
take you to the White House.

07:03.522 --> 07:05.122
Good. 'Cause I have some recommendations

07:05.146 --> 07:07.325
for the president.

07:07.326 --> 07:10.094
And after the incident at UVA,

07:10.095 --> 07:13.231
has Mr. Merchant attempted
to... make contact

07:13.232 --> 07:14.899
with your wife in any way?

07:14.900 --> 07:16.334
Not that we're aware of.

07:16.335 --> 07:17.835
But on social media,

07:17.836 --> 07:20.371
he's been highly critical
of U.S. foreign policy

07:20.372 --> 07:24.509
in general and of my wife specifically.

07:24.510 --> 07:25.777
"Secretary McCord's legacy:

07:25.778 --> 07:27.345
a string of epic disasters"

07:27.346 --> 07:29.914
"Secretary McCord should be ashamed.

07:29.915 --> 07:32.917
So many innocent lives
ruined. #criminal."

07:32.918 --> 07:35.420
Tell me, did any of his posts contain

07:35.421 --> 07:39.190
direct threats against the
secretary or your family?

07:39.191 --> 07:40.158
Direct threats, no.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.459
Then as much as I might

07:41.460 --> 07:43.161
disagree with them,

07:43.162 --> 07:44.963
the man's entitled to his opinions.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.232
Of course. But look at this.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.801
On his profile page, under "Works At,"

07:49.802 --> 07:51.769
he wrote "I.T. Specialist."

07:51.770 --> 07:55.440
Now, given the technical nature
of the attacks against my family

07:55.441 --> 07:57.064
and his history with
my wife, I would say

07:57.065 --> 07:59.711
that Ray Merchant has
both means and motive.

07:59.712 --> 08:02.180
He might.

08:02.181 --> 08:03.615
As I said, we're looking carefully

08:03.616 --> 08:05.350
at a range of potential suspects.

08:05.351 --> 08:08.319
But I assure you, we'll
look at Mr. Merchant as well.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.520
When?

08:09.521 --> 08:11.289
Look, the main thing

08:11.290 --> 08:12.953
is for you and your
family to stay calm...

08:12.954 --> 08:15.426
My family is under
attack, Agent Santangelo.

08:15.427 --> 08:17.662
I asked you a question.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.063
When are you going to
look into Ray Merchant?

08:20.798 --> 08:22.667
As soon as possible.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.669
Thank you for your time.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.170
Of course.

08:26.171 --> 08:29.173
My regards to the secretary.

08:29.174 --> 08:31.365
Bess, I'm thinking

08:31.366 --> 08:33.366
you should hold off
on your trip to Vietnam

08:33.368 --> 08:34.934
until things are settled with China.

08:34.936 --> 08:37.004
With respect, sir, I disagree.

08:37.005 --> 08:39.740
I think the catfish can wait.

08:39.741 --> 08:43.109
But our response to
China's aggression can't.

08:43.878 --> 08:45.279
They're up to something.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.047
I don't... I don't know what.

08:48.949 --> 08:50.984
Best guess?

08:51.786 --> 08:54.855
They're using this... random event

08:54.856 --> 08:59.193
with these activists showing
up on Shipwreck Reef as...

08:59.194 --> 09:00.762
pretext to go big

09:00.763 --> 09:02.363
in the South China Sea.

09:02.364 --> 09:03.931
To, what, leverage us

09:03.932 --> 09:06.167
into accepting their territorial claims?

09:06.168 --> 09:08.903
Well, why else would
they be so intransigent

09:08.904 --> 09:11.505
when there's so much at stake?

09:11.506 --> 09:13.774
I mean, maybe they've decided

09:13.775 --> 09:15.443
this is their moment.

09:15.444 --> 09:17.144
So what do you suggest we do?

09:17.145 --> 09:18.813
Well,

09:18.814 --> 09:21.080
go to Vietnam.

09:22.516 --> 09:24.684
Together.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.723
A presidential visit would
certainly send the Chinese

09:28.724 --> 09:31.625
a message that we're not blinking.

09:31.626 --> 09:35.129
Furthermore, the catfish
deal got hung up in part

09:35.130 --> 09:36.764
because Vietnam was holding out

09:36.765 --> 09:39.333
for a small amount of
lethal military aid.

09:39.334 --> 09:42.336
I propose that if China
hasn't released the activists

09:42.337 --> 09:44.338
by the time we touch down,

09:44.339 --> 09:45.973
we give Vietnam the kitchen sink.

09:45.974 --> 09:50.511
Wow. Chen must have really
pissed you off this morning.

09:50.512 --> 09:53.246
You'd think he'd know better by now.

09:54.682 --> 09:56.150
How does this

09:56.151 --> 09:58.486
comport with our values?

09:58.487 --> 10:02.123
Vietnam's human rights record
isn't exactly inspirational.

10:02.124 --> 10:04.291
Which is why we'll
include certain benchmarks

10:04.292 --> 10:07.294
that they'll have to meet to
get the hardware they want.

10:07.295 --> 10:10.231
You know, the last time I saw Vietnam

10:10.232 --> 10:12.600
was at the end of my
second tour of duty.

10:12.601 --> 10:14.135
Well, no time like the present.

10:14.136 --> 10:15.669
You'd not only be sending

10:15.670 --> 10:18.806
a message to China but to
the Evans campaign as well.

10:18.807 --> 10:21.408
Show that just because you're
running as an independent,

10:21.409 --> 10:22.977
you haven't gone soft on defense.

10:22.978 --> 10:25.557
Which is something that Evans
is always going on about.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.344
Yeah. Pretty rich coming
from a guy who hasn't seen

10:27.345 --> 10:28.768
the inside of a recruitment center,

10:28.769 --> 10:30.046
much less a combat zone.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.082
Well, we all serve in our own way.

10:32.083 --> 10:33.049
Yes.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.418
And you served

10:34.419 --> 10:35.385
with honor.

10:35.386 --> 10:37.354
I mean, if you were to revisit

10:37.355 --> 10:39.489
some of your old... I'm not trading

10:39.490 --> 10:41.825
on my military service
for the damn election.

10:41.826 --> 10:42.793
Of course not.

10:42.794 --> 10:43.927
Still,

10:43.928 --> 10:45.429
Bess makes a good point.

10:45.430 --> 10:47.030
China's pushing us.

10:47.031 --> 10:48.498
We need to push back.

10:48.499 --> 10:50.333
The trip's on.

10:50.334 --> 10:51.868
That'll be all.

10:51.869 --> 10:54.169
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes, sir.

11:00.544 --> 11:02.646
Mr. President, I'd
heard wonderful things

11:02.647 --> 11:04.781
about the progress
your country has made,

11:04.782 --> 11:06.550
but those reports pale in comparison

11:06.551 --> 11:08.084
to seeing it firsthand.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.120
Thank you, Mr. President.

11:10.121 --> 11:12.022
We felt you would be more interested

11:12.023 --> 11:13.557
to see Ho Chi Minh City,

11:13.558 --> 11:15.325
which you would
remember from your youth,

11:15.326 --> 11:16.460
than the capital.

11:16.461 --> 11:17.527
If you had told me

11:17.528 --> 11:18.929
when I was a 20-year-old lieutenant

11:18.930 --> 11:20.873
that all these years
later, this is where I'd be,

11:20.874 --> 11:24.008
I'd have told you you're crazy.

11:24.701 --> 11:26.169
If you had told me

11:26.170 --> 11:28.538
that I would even survive the war,

11:28.539 --> 11:31.807
I would have told you you were crazy.

11:33.176 --> 11:36.046
Look at them, strolling and chatting.

11:36.047 --> 11:38.281
You'd never guess they fought
a war against each other.

11:38.282 --> 11:41.718
Well, our countries
have come a long way.

11:41.719 --> 11:44.754
Yes, but not so far that the
president of the United States

11:44.755 --> 11:46.223
just drops by to say hello.

11:46.224 --> 11:48.758
Again, I do apologize
for the short notice.

11:48.759 --> 11:51.194
No, it's an honor.

11:51.195 --> 11:53.530
But with all due
respect, Madam Secretary,

11:53.531 --> 11:55.364
I'm waiting for the catch.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.235
We came here to discuss

11:58.236 --> 12:00.337
the military aid portion
of the trade deal.

12:00.338 --> 12:01.872
Which we will have to insist upon

12:01.873 --> 12:03.940
if any deal is to go through.

12:03.941 --> 12:06.343
The United States is prepared to lift

12:06.344 --> 12:09.244
the arms embargo entirely.

12:10.847 --> 12:14.383
What's the matter,
catfish got your tongue?

12:16.686 --> 12:18.989
We were prepared for a much bigger fight

12:18.990 --> 12:21.358
over much less.

12:21.359 --> 12:24.995
Well, here's the catch
you were waiting for.

12:24.996 --> 12:26.496
There are certain human rights

12:26.497 --> 12:28.965
and civil society benchmarks

12:28.966 --> 12:31.601
that Vietnam will have
to meet in order to get

12:31.602 --> 12:33.570
the bigger ticket military items.

12:33.571 --> 12:37.107
Dissidents for destroyers....

12:37.108 --> 12:41.378
Of course, the timing of all this

12:41.379 --> 12:44.714
makes me wonder if this sudden windfall

12:44.715 --> 12:46.816
has something to do with the activists

12:46.817 --> 12:48.485
China recently detained.

12:48.486 --> 12:50.754
Let's just say that we value

12:50.755 --> 12:53.590
your sovereignty in the South China Sea

12:53.591 --> 12:55.924
as much as you do.

12:59.963 --> 13:02.566
Sir, you wanted to see me?

13:02.567 --> 13:05.769
Just wanted to say nice
work putting this together.

13:05.770 --> 13:06.870
Thank you.

13:06.871 --> 13:08.004
Yeah.

13:08.005 --> 13:09.472
It was good that I came here.

13:09.473 --> 13:11.840
Well, I think so.

13:14.911 --> 13:17.147
The city's so different now,

13:17.148 --> 13:19.249
but the air...

13:19.250 --> 13:21.918
smells, feels the same.

13:21.919 --> 13:23.253
Humidity,

13:23.254 --> 13:26.021
smoke from the cooking fires.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.694
Just the faintest hint of jasmine.

13:30.695 --> 13:31.828
I understand.

13:31.829 --> 13:33.430
I think.

13:33.431 --> 13:35.699
Every time I go back
to the Middle East...

13:35.700 --> 13:37.701
the heat,

13:37.702 --> 13:39.069
the sand in my clothes.

13:39.070 --> 13:40.971
Well...

13:40.972 --> 13:43.540
it brings a lot of it back.

13:43.541 --> 13:45.841
Not all of it welcome.

13:50.146 --> 13:52.949
Russell's always after me
to tout my service more.

13:52.950 --> 13:55.485
Well, you certainly could.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.020
Got a lot to be proud of.

13:57.021 --> 13:58.154
Don't get me wrong,

13:58.155 --> 14:00.589
I'm proud to have served, but...

14:02.659 --> 14:05.127
...as for what I actually did...

14:06.930 --> 14:08.564
One time...

14:10.767 --> 14:12.902
I came this close

14:12.903 --> 14:15.005
to shooting a woman

14:15.006 --> 14:17.306
and the baby in her arms.

14:18.708 --> 14:20.976
Yep.

14:23.680 --> 14:28.018
I was all jacked up on
adrenaline from a firefight.

14:28.019 --> 14:30.353
Heard footsteps behind
me, so I whirled around,

14:30.354 --> 14:32.621
weapon up, safety off.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.227
I honestly can't tell you
why I didn't pull the trigger.

14:37.228 --> 14:40.597
It sure wasn't wisdom or heroism

14:40.598 --> 14:44.466
or... leadership.

14:47.704 --> 14:50.005
It was luck.

14:51.908 --> 14:55.878
Flash of a feeling, at best.

14:57.914 --> 15:00.316
And that's the difference
between me living

15:00.317 --> 15:02.619
in the White House

15:02.620 --> 15:07.022
instead of on the
street, like so many guys.

15:13.064 --> 15:14.987
Listen to the old marine go on and on.

15:14.988 --> 15:17.216
- No, no, it's okay. I'm...
- Jet lag.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.688
Mr. President, Madam Secretary,
pardon my interruption.

15:19.689 --> 15:20.759
Blake, what's up?

15:20.760 --> 15:23.060
Minister Chen is here and
wants to see you immediately.

15:23.895 --> 15:25.363
Well, that didn't take long.

15:25.364 --> 15:27.464
Guess they got our message.

15:34.673 --> 15:36.775
Minister Chen, what a pleasant surprise.

15:36.776 --> 15:38.043
Is it?

15:38.044 --> 15:39.578
Did you honestly think we would let

15:39.579 --> 15:41.947
these outrageous
provocations go unanswered?

15:41.948 --> 15:44.116
Did you honestly think

15:44.117 --> 15:45.684
we would?

15:45.685 --> 15:48.220
The primary purpose of my visit is

15:48.221 --> 15:50.822
to remind Vietnam we
have many levers to pull

15:50.823 --> 15:53.325
if they choose to take
our friendship for granted.

15:53.326 --> 15:56.394
That's what you call
your history with Vietnam?

15:56.395 --> 15:59.264
A friendship based on mutual respect?

15:59.265 --> 16:01.900
That you would presume to lecture me

16:01.901 --> 16:04.002
on friendship with
Vietnam, when your country

16:04.003 --> 16:07.539
killed millions of
Vietnamese, would be laughable

16:07.540 --> 16:10.674
if it weren't so sickening.

16:19.885 --> 16:23.155
Those activists are innocent,

16:23.156 --> 16:26.992
and their families are terrified.

16:26.993 --> 16:28.894
Give 'em back, Ming,

16:28.895 --> 16:31.562
before this goes any further.

16:33.031 --> 16:34.933
To the contrary,

16:34.934 --> 16:37.669
the Ministry of Justice
has moved up their trial.

16:37.670 --> 16:40.938
Espionage being such a serious crime.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.175
I warned you not to
meddle in our affairs.

16:46.111 --> 16:49.980
Now there will be consequences.

17:21.646 --> 17:23.748
Tired of those extra pounds

17:23.749 --> 17:26.483
but even more tired of
trying to take them off?

17:26.484 --> 17:29.754
Old-school sit-ups aren't just
hard... they don't even work.

17:29.755 --> 17:32.924
So smash those pounds
away with Pound Smasher.

17:32.925 --> 17:35.060
Pound Smasher's
patented ergonomic design

17:35.061 --> 17:36.962
will melt your waistline fast.

17:36.963 --> 17:40.265
Just minutes a day will
take those belt sizes away.

17:40.266 --> 17:43.635
- So don't just take those extra
pounds lying down. - What the hell?

17:43.636 --> 17:45.303
Smash 'em with Pound Smasher.

17:45.304 --> 17:48.278
Dump that pony keg for
a six-pack and get the...

17:48.279 --> 17:49.182
Dad!

17:49.183 --> 17:50.475
I'm here! I'm down here!

17:50.476 --> 17:52.744
What's going on? Why
are all the lights on?

17:52.745 --> 17:54.646
It's like a Stephen King novel up there.

17:54.647 --> 17:57.515
I don't know. It's...
probably just a power surge.

18:00.553 --> 18:02.520
Dr. McCord, is everything all right?

18:02.521 --> 18:04.122
All right, all right, it's okay.

18:04.123 --> 18:06.491
Hey, easy, easy, easy, easy. It's okay.

18:10.262 --> 18:18.083
<font color="#33FF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

18:21.023 --> 18:23.454
We've taken the house's
appliances offline

18:23.455 --> 18:26.023
so they can't be hacked again.

18:26.024 --> 18:28.526
They shouldn't have been able
to be hacked in the first place.

18:29.828 --> 18:31.862
Did the hackers leave any signatures

18:31.863 --> 18:34.932
- that you can work with?
- So far, it's untraceable.

18:35.775 --> 18:37.275
I understand your frustration.

18:37.276 --> 18:39.344
No, I-I don't think you do.

18:39.345 --> 18:41.046
We live surrounded by security,

18:41.047 --> 18:43.014
and yet somehow these people managed

18:43.015 --> 18:44.916
to essentially get into our home.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.260
Dr. McCord, with all due respect,

18:46.261 --> 18:49.454
whoever did this,
this is what they want:

18:49.455 --> 18:50.755
for you to lose confidence

18:50.756 --> 18:52.891
in the people charged with
protecting your family.

18:52.892 --> 18:55.894
Well, with all due
respect, it's working.

18:55.895 --> 18:57.762
Did you look into Ray Merchant?

18:57.763 --> 18:59.226
He's part of our investigation, yes.

18:59.227 --> 19:00.231
And what did you find?

19:00.232 --> 19:01.599
He's a private citizen.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.501
I can't share those
kinds of details with you.

19:03.502 --> 19:06.705
No leads, no information
sharing, and yet you expect

19:06.706 --> 19:08.840
the secretary of state and her family

19:08.841 --> 19:10.709
to stay in a house
that can't be secured.

19:10.710 --> 19:13.478
Do I have that right, Agent Santangelo?

19:13.479 --> 19:14.646
What the hell has to happen

19:14.647 --> 19:16.348
for you people to actually do your jobs?

19:16.349 --> 19:18.116
Dad...

19:18.117 --> 19:19.951
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

19:19.952 --> 19:21.852
Go upstairs. I'll-I'll
be up in a minute.

19:27.058 --> 19:29.361
Again, the house is offline.

19:29.362 --> 19:32.630
Diplomatic Security's on high alert.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.666
This house is probably the safest place

19:34.667 --> 19:36.467
the secretary could be.

19:38.169 --> 19:40.572
And what does that tell you?

19:40.573 --> 19:41.573
How was your trip?

19:41.574 --> 19:43.375
So relaxing.

19:43.376 --> 19:44.976
What can I help you with?

19:44.977 --> 19:46.711
I'm hearing things.

19:46.712 --> 19:49.247
Inside or outside of your head?

19:49.248 --> 19:52.017
A reporter told me he heard
there was a security breach

19:52.018 --> 19:53.451
at your home last night?

19:53.452 --> 19:55.715
Well, then that reporter just
earned himself an exclusive

19:55.716 --> 19:58.690
- with me at an unspecified future date.
- Why?

19:58.691 --> 20:00.314
Because he's not going
to run that story.

20:00.315 --> 20:03.428
I... I...

20:03.429 --> 20:05.764
My...

20:05.765 --> 20:09.000
family and I are being stalked

20:09.001 --> 20:12.404
by a very capable individual or group.

20:12.405 --> 20:13.605
My God.

20:13.606 --> 20:14.973
Well, it is what it is.

20:14.974 --> 20:17.375
But stalkers feed on engagement.

20:17.376 --> 20:18.777
So if this becomes news,

20:18.778 --> 20:21.346
then they will have
achieved their goal, which,

20:21.347 --> 20:22.881
in turn, will encourage them

20:22.882 --> 20:24.416
to continue. You see where I'm going.

20:24.417 --> 20:27.752
I should be able to move him
off without giving anything away.

20:27.753 --> 20:29.087
Yeah. Thank you.

20:29.088 --> 20:33.391
Well, it's a small price
to pay for 20 minutes alone

20:33.392 --> 20:35.727
with our charming and
delightful secretary of state.

20:35.728 --> 20:37.062
She sounds great.

20:37.063 --> 20:38.463
I'd like to meet her someday.

20:39.665 --> 20:41.266
More good news, I bet.

20:41.267 --> 20:43.001
- Welcome back, ma'am.
- Thank you.

20:43.002 --> 20:46.171
China appears to be
acting on its threats.

20:46.172 --> 20:48.573
- What's going on?
- Well, as you know, the USS

20:48.574 --> 20:50.208
Wayne Morris Carrier Strike Group

20:50.209 --> 20:52.277
has moved into the South China Sea.

20:52.278 --> 20:55.980
Now Chinese fighters are flying
dangerously close to our ships.

20:55.981 --> 20:59.417
Boy, I wish I knew what
they were playing at.

20:59.418 --> 21:01.486
Yeah. And, one other thing.

21:01.487 --> 21:03.521
It seems China plans

21:03.522 --> 21:07.158
to recall their pandas from
the Smithsonian's National Zoo.

21:07.159 --> 21:08.293
Their pandas?

21:08.294 --> 21:09.561
From the National Zoo.

21:09.562 --> 21:10.762
Yes, ma'am.

21:10.763 --> 21:12.464
I thought they were a gift.

21:12.465 --> 21:13.631
They were on loan,

21:13.632 --> 21:15.733
and, apparently, China

21:15.734 --> 21:17.802
can take them back whenever they wish.

21:17.803 --> 21:19.537
So, not a gift then.

21:19.538 --> 21:21.506
Okay, thank you.

21:21.507 --> 21:23.842
Holding our citizens,

21:23.843 --> 21:26.244
buzzing our ships, taking our pandas.

21:26.245 --> 21:28.246
Can't say they're not
covering their bases.

21:28.247 --> 21:30.115
You tell me there's
fresh coffee in here.

21:30.116 --> 21:32.817
There is. Also Jay and Tom Murphy,

21:32.818 --> 21:35.320
the head of the Ocean Relief Foundation.

21:35.321 --> 21:37.655
Thanks.

21:39.191 --> 21:40.859
Mr. Murphy,

21:40.860 --> 21:42.327
pleasure to meet you.

21:42.328 --> 21:45.096
I'm sorry it's under such
challenging circumstances.

21:45.097 --> 21:46.431
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

21:46.432 --> 21:47.866
I was just assuring Mr. Murphy

21:47.867 --> 21:51.035
that the State Department is
deeply concerned about the fate

21:51.036 --> 21:53.505
of the Ocean Relief
members in Chinese custody.

21:53.506 --> 21:54.772
And I was just about to say

21:54.773 --> 21:56.807
you sure have a funny way of showing it.

21:58.843 --> 22:01.513
I sense your disrespectful tone

22:01.514 --> 22:03.248
is meant to goad me into asking,

22:03.249 --> 22:04.782
"What do you mean by that?"

22:04.783 --> 22:06.251
Our server.

22:06.252 --> 22:07.852
Well, it was hacked.

22:07.853 --> 22:09.621
Pretty much fried.

22:09.622 --> 22:12.657
Years of files, terabytes
of heavily encrypted data

22:12.658 --> 22:14.292
just... pfft... gone, overnight.

22:14.293 --> 22:17.195
Curious timing, no?

22:17.196 --> 22:19.164
Indeed. Have you spoken with the FBI?

22:19.165 --> 22:20.532
The FBI.

22:20.533 --> 22:22.396
As if they haven't been
harassing us for years.

22:22.397 --> 22:25.370
Look, Madam Secretary,

22:25.371 --> 22:28.506
we tell the people
what they need to hear.

22:28.507 --> 22:30.475
Okay? Big corporations

22:30.476 --> 22:32.143
and their lackeys in government

22:32.144 --> 22:33.344
don't appreciate that.

22:33.345 --> 22:35.446
I-I'm sorry, but are
you kidding me with this?

22:35.447 --> 22:37.916
We're trying to free your
colleagues and-and you come here

22:37.917 --> 22:39.984
and spin out some paranoid fantasy?

22:39.985 --> 22:42.220
Mr. Murphy, we're on your side.

22:42.221 --> 22:44.422
Why would we hack your server?

22:44.423 --> 22:47.058
The U.S. and China are business
partners in the South China Sea

22:47.059 --> 22:48.362
just as often as they're rivals.

22:48.363 --> 22:49.727
You're not gonna let little things

22:49.728 --> 22:51.196
like the health of the planet

22:51.197 --> 22:52.797
and food security for millions of people

22:52.798 --> 22:54.131
get in the way of all that money.

22:54.132 --> 22:55.900
Got it.

22:55.901 --> 22:57.135
You're pretty self-righteous for a guy

22:57.136 --> 22:58.457
who sent a bunch of 20-somethings

22:58.458 --> 23:00.359
into one of the most
dangerous places on Earth.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.472
They knew what they were

23:01.473 --> 23:03.074
getting into.

23:03.075 --> 23:05.677
Based on my understanding

23:05.678 --> 23:08.846
of the Chinese judicial system...

23:08.847 --> 23:11.815
I can assure you they did not.

23:14.452 --> 23:16.020
Tell me,

23:16.021 --> 23:18.489
when did your server go down?

23:19.925 --> 23:22.493
shortly after we, lost contact

23:22.494 --> 23:24.695
with Becca and the others.

23:26.798 --> 23:29.434
Mr. Murphy, thanks for coming in.

23:29.435 --> 23:31.336
We didn't hack your server,

23:31.337 --> 23:33.280
and we're gonna try and
get your colleagues back,

23:33.281 --> 23:35.907
and I will keep you up
to date with our progress.

23:35.908 --> 23:39.210
Thanks for coming in. Blake.

23:39.211 --> 23:40.812
Well...

23:40.813 --> 23:42.914
he was right about one thing...

23:42.915 --> 23:44.716
the timing is pretty strange.

23:44.717 --> 23:45.917
I think it's safe

23:45.918 --> 23:48.987
to assume the U.S.
didn't hack Ocean Relief,

23:48.988 --> 23:53.024
so that leaves the most obvious suspect.

23:53.025 --> 23:55.860
Exactly.

23:55.861 --> 23:57.996
You were right, ma'am.
The root kit involved

23:57.997 --> 24:01.499
had all the signatures of the
other Chinese cyber attacks.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.501
Do you think this is just revenge

24:03.502 --> 24:06.337
for the activists making
the Chinese look bad,

24:06.338 --> 24:07.972
or something more concrete?

24:07.973 --> 24:09.741
Um, Madam Secretary, if I may...

24:11.277 --> 24:13.780
Moments prior to their capture,
the activists on Shipwreck Reef

24:13.781 --> 24:16.781
uploaded a couple of video files
to the Ocean Relief's network,

24:16.782 --> 24:18.783
and the Chinese used

24:18.784 --> 24:20.767
a brute-force attack to
gain access to the server,

24:20.768 --> 24:22.920
then initiated a script
to wipe all the files.

24:22.921 --> 24:24.224
They weren't taking any chances.

24:24.225 --> 24:25.356
Well, can you recover 'em?

24:25.357 --> 24:27.959
I'll do my absolute best, ma'am.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.061
- Great work so far.
- Thank you, ma'am.

24:30.062 --> 24:31.863
You know you don't have to say "ma'am"

24:31.864 --> 24:33.264
after every time, Captain.

24:33.265 --> 24:35.266
Yes, ma'am. Sorry.

24:35.267 --> 24:38.036
It's just, habit.
And also... nerves.

24:38.037 --> 24:40.104
You're kind of my hero.

24:40.105 --> 24:41.506
Happens to the best of us.

24:41.507 --> 24:44.008
You're on secondment to Oliver Shaw

24:44.009 --> 24:45.476
- from CyberCom?
- Yes.

24:45.477 --> 24:48.713
So how come you're not in Silicon Valley

24:48.714 --> 24:50.682
inventing distracting apps?

24:50.683 --> 24:53.917
I like fighting bad guys.

24:54.686 --> 24:56.554
Me, too.

24:56.555 --> 24:59.090
Okay, obviously, these
activists stumbled on something

24:59.091 --> 25:01.192
some of the Chinese
wanted to keep hidden.

25:01.193 --> 25:03.059
Question is, what?

25:08.097 --> 25:10.426
I got a call from FBI Director

25:10.427 --> 25:12.187
- Doherty this morning.
- Calling to complain

25:12.188 --> 25:13.731
that I yelled at Santangelo, no doubt.

25:13.732 --> 25:14.731
No, I think

25:14.732 --> 25:16.466
it was for the opposite reason.

25:16.467 --> 25:18.034
It was like a customer service call.

25:18.035 --> 25:20.470
He wanted to make sure
that I'm satisfied.

25:20.471 --> 25:21.671
Good.

25:21.672 --> 25:23.907
No, Henry, not good.

25:23.908 --> 25:26.709
These are the people charged
with protecting our lives.

25:26.710 --> 25:28.144
We need to trust them.

25:28.145 --> 25:30.046
What if they're not up to the job?

25:30.047 --> 25:32.615
The FBI and Diplomatic Security.
Do you ever think about that?

25:32.616 --> 25:35.251
No. Because, if I did, I'd have to quit.

25:35.252 --> 25:37.754
Look, I know that

25:37.755 --> 25:41.191
this Ray Merchant
theory is compelling...

25:41.192 --> 25:43.159
Don't talk to me like I'm crazy.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.661
Then stop acting like it.

25:44.662 --> 25:47.063
The kids were terrified last
night. Do you understand that?

25:47.064 --> 25:48.198
Yes, and you

25:48.199 --> 25:50.033
getting obsessed about it isn't helpful.

25:50.034 --> 25:51.367
I am not just

25:51.368 --> 25:53.568
- gonna sit back and do nothing.
- Be better if you did.

25:53.569 --> 25:55.329
- Am I embarrassing you now?
- You know what?

25:55.353 --> 25:57.407
We're both stressed and
tired, so I'm gonna choose

25:57.408 --> 25:58.741
to believe you didn't mean that.

25:58.742 --> 26:00.575
- Elizabeth, I...
- No, I got to go.

26:02.345 --> 26:03.580
So, the pack

26:03.581 --> 26:05.548
was all over me about
China at the briefing.

26:05.549 --> 26:07.817
But you'll be happy to know
that the reporter I mentioned

26:07.818 --> 26:09.592
is quietly awaiting
his one-on-one with you.

26:10.154 --> 26:13.088
- Thank you. Well done.
- We're not sending 'em back.

26:14.023 --> 26:15.158
Russell Jackson, ma'am.

26:15.159 --> 26:16.593
Who are we not sending back?

26:16.594 --> 26:18.862
What do you mean, who? The pandas.

26:18.863 --> 26:21.598
Not Tian Tian, not Bao
Bao, not little Bei Bei...

26:21.599 --> 26:24.934
none of them. They're ours,
and they're staying right here,

26:24.935 --> 26:27.604
- do you understand?
- Technically, they're not ours.

26:27.605 --> 26:30.148
China's thrown the rule book out
the window, so don't talk to me

26:30.149 --> 26:33.109
about "technically." It's time
to draw a line in the sand.

26:33.110 --> 26:34.644
Well, I couldn't agree more.

26:34.645 --> 26:38.381
I'm just... I'm not so sure
this is quite the issue.

26:38.382 --> 26:41.985
No? Then let me ask
you this: How many people

26:41.986 --> 26:46.356
visit the National Zoo each
year just to see those pandas?

26:46.357 --> 26:48.157
- Millions.
- That's right.

26:48.158 --> 26:50.660
Millions. So, on top of
all the other humiliations

26:50.661 --> 26:53.229
that China is visiting upon our heads,

26:53.230 --> 26:55.531
those millions of voters

26:55.532 --> 26:56.833
are about to watch us surrender

26:56.834 --> 26:59.435
their favorite charismatic megafauna...

26:59.436 --> 27:01.871
the very crown jewels
of our National Zoo...

27:01.872 --> 27:03.473
without a single damn shot!

27:03.474 --> 27:05.875
Not on my watch, lady.
It is not happening.

27:05.876 --> 27:07.176
So...

27:07.177 --> 27:09.445
you want us to stop them?

27:09.446 --> 27:11.481
What do you think I'm here for?

27:11.482 --> 27:14.550
Well, just... No
offense, Russell, but I...

27:14.551 --> 27:16.619
Don't you think, maybe,
you're-you're letting

27:16.620 --> 27:18.922
the tail wag the panda here?

27:18.923 --> 27:21.057
You want to make fun?

27:21.058 --> 27:22.725
Well, go ahead.

27:22.726 --> 27:26.195
Guess what. In international relations,

27:26.196 --> 27:27.964
symbols matter.

27:27.965 --> 27:30.500
In elections, even more so.
I'll give you another example.

27:30.501 --> 27:34.070
At the zoo, they've got this
camera set up in their habitat.

27:34.071 --> 27:36.806
- Panda Cam.
- That's right. One day, very soon,

27:36.807 --> 27:38.775
the Panda Cam will go dark.

27:38.776 --> 27:40.643
And when it does, and kids

27:40.644 --> 27:42.912
all over America start crying

27:42.913 --> 27:45.481
'cause Bei Bei's not
in his little house,

27:45.482 --> 27:47.684
who do you think their
parents are gonna blame?

27:47.685 --> 27:50.320
China gets it, believe me.

27:50.321 --> 27:51.754
So do I.

27:53.524 --> 27:56.191
We're on it.

27:57.093 --> 27:58.728
Wait.

27:58.729 --> 28:00.096
You're a Panda-Cammer, too?

28:00.097 --> 28:01.630
Shut up.

28:02.966 --> 28:05.201
It's relaxing.

28:05.202 --> 28:07.903
It's good for my blood pressure.

28:09.572 --> 28:11.040
Who saw that coming?

28:11.041 --> 28:12.909
A-mazing.

28:12.910 --> 28:14.477
Well, you heard the man.

28:14.478 --> 28:16.612
Save our pandas.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.014
No.

28:18.015 --> 28:19.482
Get on it.

28:19.483 --> 28:21.451
What do you got for me?

28:21.452 --> 28:22.885
Something I shouldn't.

28:22.886 --> 28:25.254
My buddy at the Bureau came through.

28:25.255 --> 28:27.190
He got me some intel on your friend,

28:27.191 --> 28:28.191
Ray Merchant.

28:28.192 --> 28:29.292
And?

28:29.293 --> 28:32.095
So, after UVA, Merchant

28:32.096 --> 28:34.639
applied for government work but
couldn't get security clearance.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.299
Problem with his background check.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.467
Something he could blame Elizabeth for.

28:39.235 --> 28:40.503
Unable to find work

28:40.504 --> 28:42.505
in the hallowed halls of government

28:42.506 --> 28:44.273
writing reports nobody would ever read,

28:44.274 --> 28:46.242
our young misfit goes
back to school again.

28:46.243 --> 28:47.243
Computers this time?

28:47.244 --> 28:48.978
Cyber security, to be exact.

28:48.979 --> 28:50.346
He's two for two. What else?

28:50.347 --> 28:51.714
You're not gonna like this one.

28:51.715 --> 28:52.915
What is it?

28:52.916 --> 28:54.817
He got fired a couple of years ago.

28:54.818 --> 28:56.318
Sexually harassed a coworker.

28:57.053 --> 28:58.388
Well, he fits the profile

28:58.389 --> 29:00.957
- to a tee.
- Look... is he your guy?

29:00.958 --> 29:02.291
I don't know.

29:02.292 --> 29:04.494
But you're not wrong to
think that he might be.

29:04.495 --> 29:06.863
What are the Feds doing about it?

29:06.864 --> 29:09.098
My buddy didn't say, but
I'm sure they're into it.

29:09.099 --> 29:11.000
So now it's time to
let them do their thing.

29:11.001 --> 29:13.369
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah. Sure.

29:13.370 --> 29:15.571
Meantime, just try to
keep your mind off of it.

29:15.572 --> 29:17.907
How about we grab a beer tomorrow night?

29:17.908 --> 29:19.574
Thanks, Jose.

29:23.346 --> 29:25.148
Did you know that U.S. zoos pay China

29:25.149 --> 29:26.849
$2 million per year for the pandas

29:26.850 --> 29:28.384
- in our country?
- They are worth it.

29:28.385 --> 29:29.986
A quarter of which is supposed to be

29:29.987 --> 29:32.722
allocated for the preservation
of panda habitat in the wild.

29:32.723 --> 29:35.024
Yeah, they need their
bamboo, don't they?

29:35.025 --> 29:36.826
- Yes, you do.
- Hey, Blake. Blake.

29:36.827 --> 29:38.294
- Sorry.
- Here's the thing.

29:38.295 --> 29:40.678
- Guess what China hasn't been doing.
- Allocating a quarter

29:40.679 --> 29:42.965
of the funds towards the
panda habitat preservation?

29:42.966 --> 29:44.109
Not according to this report

29:44.110 --> 29:46.269
by a consortium of environmental groups.

29:46.270 --> 29:48.304
- Does China accept that?
- Nope.

29:48.305 --> 29:50.973
- But we did.
- Well, then, we can make the argument

29:50.974 --> 29:53.157
that they are in breach of
their half of the agreement.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.211
Therefore, we don't have
to give the pandas back.

29:55.212 --> 29:57.647
That's got to be good
enough for Russell Jackson.

29:57.648 --> 29:59.015
Let's hope so.

29:59.016 --> 30:01.884
By the way, can we talk about
his obsession with Panda Cam?

30:01.885 --> 30:02.952
How weird is that?

30:02.953 --> 30:05.254
I get it, man. I
am all in... Yes!

30:05.255 --> 30:06.923
You are tired from your snack

30:06.924 --> 30:08.958
and need a nap in the sun.

30:08.959 --> 30:11.127
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Captain Ronnie Baker

30:11.128 --> 30:13.029
from Oliver Shaw's office,
to see the secretary?

30:13.030 --> 30:15.131
Yes, the secretary's expecting you.

30:15.132 --> 30:16.431
Wait.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.367
You're Ronnie?

30:18.368 --> 30:19.635
Yes, ma'am.

30:19.636 --> 30:21.003
From Oliver's office?

30:21.004 --> 30:22.605
Yes, ma'am.

30:22.606 --> 30:24.907
You don't have to call me "ma'am."

30:24.908 --> 30:26.476
We're like the same age.

30:26.477 --> 30:28.243
S-Sorry. It's a habit.

30:29.145 --> 30:31.280
My God. You're Daisy,

30:31.281 --> 30:32.915
from... from you know. From his

30:32.916 --> 30:35.518
- personal life.
- And you're Ronnie. From work.

30:35.519 --> 30:36.686
And texts about work.

30:36.687 --> 30:39.489
"Sorry, I have to take
this text during dinner,

30:39.490 --> 30:41.424
national security is at stake' Ronnie.

30:41.425 --> 30:43.491
Yep. That's me.

30:44.327 --> 30:46.696
We thought you were a guy.

30:46.697 --> 30:49.899
Yeah, no. I just love your guys's story.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.934
I kind of want to give you a hug,

30:51.935 --> 30:53.436
but that's weird, right?

30:53.437 --> 30:55.304
Okay.

30:55.305 --> 30:57.006
Aw.

30:57.007 --> 30:58.574
Secretary's ready for you.

30:58.575 --> 31:00.775
I'm going.

31:01.177 --> 31:03.246
Definitely not a dude.

31:03.247 --> 31:05.114
She's sweet.

31:05.115 --> 31:06.883
Madam Secretary.

31:06.884 --> 31:08.551
Captain Baker.

31:08.552 --> 31:10.853
Were you able to recover the files?

31:10.854 --> 31:13.489
Yeah... Well, the good news
is they didn't have time

31:13.490 --> 31:15.525
to securely erase them all.

31:15.526 --> 31:19.495
So the hackers overwrote parts
of the files with random data,

31:19.496 --> 31:21.397
so we had some trouble
reconstructing them.

31:21.398 --> 31:23.132
But we found these

31:23.133 --> 31:26.269
among the most recently uploaded files.

31:26.270 --> 31:27.470
...I mean demolished.

31:27.471 --> 31:29.939
You can see the construction
going on over there.

31:29.940 --> 31:32.141
To build airstrips and radar stations,

31:32.142 --> 31:33.543
they pulverize the coral

31:33.544 --> 31:35.611
and pave over it with concrete,

31:35.612 --> 31:37.113
destroying it forever.

31:37.114 --> 31:39.148
She seems like good people.

31:39.149 --> 31:40.816
Yeah, she does.

31:40.817 --> 31:44.253
There's not really anything
here, unfortunately.

31:44.254 --> 31:47.623
Didn't you say there was footage
from a second camera, or...?

31:47.624 --> 31:50.326
Yeah. Here it is.

31:50.327 --> 31:51.727
Maybe you're thinking, "So what?

31:51.728 --> 31:53.930
"Who cares about a
little speck in the middle

31:53.931 --> 31:55.064
- of a faraway sea?"
- No.

31:55.065 --> 31:56.899
This just looks like more of the same.

31:56.900 --> 31:58.534
These reefs provide...

31:58.535 --> 32:00.269
Wait, wait, wait.

32:00.270 --> 32:02.805
Can-Can you make this...

32:02.806 --> 32:06.209
- go back?
- Yeah.

32:06.210 --> 32:08.477
These reefs provide one tenth

32:08.478 --> 32:10.111
of all seafood on...

32:11.180 --> 32:12.448
Right there.

32:12.449 --> 32:14.584
What the hell is that?

32:14.585 --> 32:16.953
It's a mobile launch pad.

32:16.954 --> 32:20.189
Specifically, a TAS5450 8x8

32:20.190 --> 32:22.124
special heavy-duty truck.

32:22.125 --> 32:23.793
Designed to deploy Dong-Feng 15

32:23.794 --> 32:25.257
Tactical-Theatre Ballistic Missiles.

32:25.258 --> 32:26.035
From that position,

32:26.036 --> 32:28.097
China can strike major
population centers

32:28.098 --> 32:30.266
all over Southeast Asia within minutes.

32:30.267 --> 32:33.769
And effectively demand control
over the entire South China Sea.

32:33.770 --> 32:35.271
This is why they were being

32:35.272 --> 32:38.474
so aggressive with the
Ocean Relief activists,

32:38.475 --> 32:39.942
why they hacked the server.

32:39.943 --> 32:42.144
They wanted to keep
the world in the dark

32:42.145 --> 32:43.648
until the missiles could be deployed.

32:43.649 --> 32:46.749
Why didn't we know about
this until now, General?

32:46.750 --> 32:49.085
The launcher was camouflaged
from aerial surveillance.

32:49.086 --> 32:50.586
We could never get close enough

32:50.587 --> 32:51.787
for ground-level observation.

32:51.788 --> 32:53.522
So you're telling me we owe this

32:53.523 --> 32:54.790
game-changing intelligence coup

32:54.791 --> 32:58.760
to a lucky break from
Scooby and the gang?

32:59.629 --> 33:00.963
Unbelievable.

33:00.964 --> 33:02.898
And if the launcher is already there,

33:02.899 --> 33:05.568
the missiles are only
days away from delivery.

33:05.569 --> 33:07.072
This is a massive escalation.

33:07.073 --> 33:10.842
And China needs to know
that it won't stand.

33:18.927 --> 33:22.000
Madam Secretary, I don't know where
you're getting this information.

33:22.001 --> 33:24.368
From the server you tried to destroy.

33:24.369 --> 33:25.736
But we'll come back

33:25.737 --> 33:28.138
to the cyber warfare another time.

33:28.139 --> 33:30.207
You've got bigger problems right now.

33:30.208 --> 33:32.943
Do I? Because I have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.178
And, you know,

33:34.179 --> 33:36.280
it's a good thing you don't.

33:36.281 --> 33:39.249
It was a mistake that your military

33:39.250 --> 33:40.784
didn't loop you in.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.486
Because...

33:42.487 --> 33:46.657
with your close personal ties
to the American government,

33:46.658 --> 33:49.827
I am sure you could have
told them with certainty

33:49.828 --> 33:53.397
that we will never permit
those missiles to be deployed.

33:53.398 --> 33:55.899
It is not for the United States
to tell us what is permitted.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.202
On your own territory.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.404
But let's... let's put a pin

34:00.405 --> 34:04.107
in the sovereignty stuff for now.

34:05.175 --> 34:07.111
Because if your neighbors find out

34:07.112 --> 34:11.715
that you secretly planned to
settle this issue at gunpoint,

34:11.716 --> 34:14.885
I think they would be
more than supportive

34:14.886 --> 34:17.087
of the U.S.'s response.

34:17.088 --> 34:19.023
And what sort of response might that be?

34:19.024 --> 34:21.525
China's deployment of
that missile launcher

34:21.525 --> 34:23.793
violently upsets the status quo.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.263
And our response, therefore,

34:26.264 --> 34:30.666
will be equally violent and upsetting.

34:31.368 --> 34:33.370
Indeed...

34:33.371 --> 34:35.906
I am shocked

34:35.907 --> 34:37.541
that I was not made privy

34:37.542 --> 34:40.210
to such a drastic step
on my government's part.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.780
I knew that you would be troubled.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.648
If I were to offer some suggestions

34:44.649 --> 34:47.784
to my president as to
how we might de-escalate,

34:47.786 --> 34:49.652
what might they be?

34:49.654 --> 34:51.522
Well, for starters,

34:51.523 --> 34:55.725
we've looked into it, and we're
not giving the pandas back.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.868
Sir, that bogey's coming
around for another pass.

35:04.869 --> 35:06.503
It's coming in too low, sir!

35:06.504 --> 35:08.004
All stations, brace for impact.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.309
The Chinese pilot buzzed the Morris,

35:12.310 --> 35:14.745
flew too low and clipped the tower.

35:14.746 --> 35:18.148
So far, three sailors have
died and 16 others are wounded.

35:18.149 --> 35:20.517
NSC and Joint Chiefs are
waiting in the Sit Room.

35:20.518 --> 35:22.486
I told the networks
that you wanted airtime

35:22.487 --> 35:24.662
to address the nation
later this evening.

35:24.663 --> 35:25.355
Good.

35:25.356 --> 35:29.592
Evans already has his campaign
pumping out tweets. The ghoul.

35:31.395 --> 35:32.863
Sir, when I spoke to Minister Chen

35:32.864 --> 35:34.732
hours before this
incident, he seemed prepared

35:34.733 --> 35:36.400
to accept our terms.

35:36.401 --> 35:38.569
"Seemed" being the operative word.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.804
I'm not saying China is innocent.

35:40.805 --> 35:41.972
I'm saying...

35:41.973 --> 35:44.274
the wheels turn slowly over there.

35:44.275 --> 35:46.577
So the leadership was still digesting

35:46.578 --> 35:48.979
the message we sent Chen
when this incident occurred?

35:48.980 --> 35:50.114
Tragically, yes.

35:50.115 --> 35:51.538
With all due respect,

35:51.539 --> 35:54.218
an accident caused
by reckless aggression

35:54.219 --> 35:55.964
isn't much different from an attack.

35:55.965 --> 35:58.927
They're holding our citizens,
attempting to put missiles

35:58.928 --> 36:01.091
into the SCS.

36:01.092 --> 36:02.526
And now this.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.928
How much more provocation do we need?

36:04.929 --> 36:06.430
To do what, exactly?

36:06.431 --> 36:08.398
- Respond in kind.
- A few days ago,

36:08.399 --> 36:11.135
you were lobbying for a
harder line against China.

36:11.136 --> 36:13.504
You really think they've
changed their stripes since then?

36:13.505 --> 36:15.806
Of course not, but I do
think that the pressure

36:15.807 --> 36:17.674
we put on them was effective.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.610
So let's-let's be smart.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.445
I mean, if we can get them

36:21.446 --> 36:23.313
to back down in the South China Sea,

36:23.314 --> 36:26.083
that is a huge win for global stability,

36:26.084 --> 36:29.119
but if we stumble in to
some military conflict,

36:29.120 --> 36:32.389
once that starts, no one
knows how that's gonna end.

36:32.390 --> 36:35.425
We have to take a beat
before we retaliate.

36:35.426 --> 36:37.628
Take a beat to do what?

36:37.629 --> 36:39.730
Talk to President Li.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.465
I think China's about to blink.

36:41.466 --> 36:45.068
My advice is we let them.

36:45.069 --> 36:46.503
What makes you so sure

36:46.504 --> 36:49.372
they won't interpret our
restraint as weakness?

36:50.307 --> 36:54.644
Flash of a feeling, at best.

36:58.898 --> 36:59.598
_ _

37:14.966 --> 37:16.734
Dr. McCord.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.404
What a coincidence.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.839
Good evening.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.708
Jose called you.

37:23.709 --> 37:26.109
How about we take a walk?

37:29.314 --> 37:31.149
Your friend did you a favor.

37:31.150 --> 37:32.383
Yeah, how's that?

37:32.384 --> 37:34.752
We spoke to Ray Merchant.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.321
Had a good, long talk with him.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.923
And, frankly, you were right
to bring him to our attention.

37:38.924 --> 37:42.393
The man has... issues.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.429
But he's not our guy.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.230
How can you be sure?

37:46.231 --> 37:49.067
Is he unbalanced? Probably.

37:49.068 --> 37:50.401
Still obsessed with your wife?

37:50.402 --> 37:53.438
Maybe, but this is what we know:

37:53.439 --> 37:55.106
The night your house was hacked,

37:55.107 --> 37:56.674
multiple witnesses put Merchant

37:56.675 --> 37:59.077
at a campsite in the
Blue Ridge Mountains

37:59.078 --> 38:01.779
with no Internet access.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.483
An attack this sophisticated
requires real-time input.

38:05.484 --> 38:06.718
He could have paid someone.

38:06.719 --> 38:08.019
Possibly, but I doubt it.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.253
You've seen his house.

38:09.254 --> 38:10.655
Look like he could afford to?

38:10.656 --> 38:12.297
Let alone hire two goons to mug you

38:12.298 --> 38:13.931
and steal your son's computer?

38:16.627 --> 38:17.962
No.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.665
But I'll tell you what
he's more than capable of.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.500
Suing the next person that shows up

38:22.501 --> 38:24.168
at his front door asking questions

38:24.169 --> 38:25.837
about his relationship with your wife.

38:25.838 --> 38:27.205
Suing...

38:27.206 --> 38:29.005
or maybe worse.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.409
I understand. Thank you.

38:33.778 --> 38:36.247
Go home, Dr. McCord.

38:36.248 --> 38:38.181
Your family needs you.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.023
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

38:46.024 --> 38:49.894
As many of you are aware, earlier today,

38:49.895 --> 38:51.696
a Chinese fighter jet

38:51.697 --> 38:54.565
struck the aircraft
carrier USS Wayne Morris

38:54.566 --> 38:56.134
in the South China Sea,

38:56.135 --> 38:58.703
taking the lives of
three American sailors

38:58.704 --> 39:00.171
and wounding many others.

39:00.172 --> 39:02.340
I spoke earlier to my
counterpart, President Li,

39:02.341 --> 39:04.609
of the People's Republic of China,

39:04.610 --> 39:07.612
to voice America's outrage
at this reckless act

39:07.613 --> 39:10.415
and unnecessary loss of life.

39:10.416 --> 39:13.684
President Li expressed sincere
regret over the incident.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.554
More importantly, he has
agreed to several steps

39:16.555 --> 39:19.824
to be outlined in the coming
days to de-escalate the crisis

39:19.825 --> 39:21.659
in the South China Sea

39:21.660 --> 39:25.163
so that another such tragedy
does not happen again.

39:25.164 --> 39:27.698
Many of you are angry.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.834
I share your anger.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.770
There are also some who would
capitalize on this tragedy

39:32.771 --> 39:35.606
to score political points.

39:35.607 --> 39:38.843
It's easy to lash out
when your blood is up.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.812
Easier still to talk tough

39:40.813 --> 39:43.281
when no one's life hangs in the balance.

39:43.282 --> 39:44.849
But when leading,

39:44.850 --> 39:48.753
whether a platoon of
marines or an entire nation,

39:48.754 --> 39:52.690
history judges us by the
wisdom of our actions.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.926
We will defend our interests,

39:54.927 --> 39:57.328
and our friends and
allies in the region.

39:57.329 --> 40:00.531
And we will hold China accountable.

40:00.532 --> 40:05.336
But we will not start a
war over one reckless act.

40:05.337 --> 40:08.473
Our thoughts and prayers go
out to the grieving families

40:08.474 --> 40:12.075
of our brave sailors who gave
their lives in our service.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.879
Thank you.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.681
And may God bless America.

40:32.196 --> 40:33.865
They're free!

40:33.866 --> 40:35.833
- Hey!
- Good.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.568
Chen kept his word.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.169
I mean, they'll still
have to stand trial

40:39.170 --> 40:41.273
at the International Tribunal
for the Law of the Sea.

40:41.274 --> 40:43.126
Well, that's to help China save face.

40:43.127 --> 40:45.362
Worst-case scenario, they pay a fine.

40:45.363 --> 40:47.044
And we're keeping the
fact that China tried

40:47.045 --> 40:49.146
- to put missiles on the reef a secret?
- Again...

40:49.147 --> 40:50.834
saving face.

40:50.835 --> 40:52.936
Well, the main this is
they've agreed to talks

40:52.937 --> 40:56.673
with their neighbors, and
in the interim they won't be

40:56.674 --> 40:59.910
leveling reefs to
build military outposts.

40:59.911 --> 41:02.479
Which, if it isn't exactly
a win for the environment,

41:02.480 --> 41:05.515
is at least a break in
the ongoing catastrophe.

41:05.516 --> 41:07.417
On that buoyant note, I'm going home.

41:07.418 --> 41:08.618
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:08.619 --> 41:10.819
Is everything all right, ma'am?

41:11.721 --> 41:13.123
Good night, guys.

41:13.124 --> 41:15.459
- Good night.
- Night-night.

41:15.460 --> 41:18.028
I wasn't wrong about that kid.

41:18.029 --> 41:19.663
You weren't right, either.

41:19.664 --> 41:22.899
Okay. I should have
trusted you about it.

41:22.900 --> 41:25.502
Yeah. You should have.

41:25.503 --> 41:27.204
God only knows what you would have done

41:27.205 --> 41:28.338
if you'd confronted him.

41:28.339 --> 41:29.973
And then what? Then-then where are we?

41:29.974 --> 41:32.107
What do you want me to say?

41:33.109 --> 41:35.679
Look...

41:35.680 --> 41:39.148
The one thing I try never to
be in my life is powerless.

41:40.383 --> 41:42.786
You and the kids are everything.

41:42.787 --> 41:45.856
The idea that all we can do is sit here

41:45.857 --> 41:47.757
and wait for the next
terrible thing to happen,

41:47.758 --> 41:49.993
it makes me feel...

41:49.994 --> 41:52.229
Angry.

41:52.230 --> 41:54.496
Yeah. Angry.

41:55.999 --> 41:58.768
And scared.

41:58.769 --> 42:01.104
Really scared.

42:01.105 --> 42:03.773
I hate it.

42:03.774 --> 42:07.277
I know. Me, too.
