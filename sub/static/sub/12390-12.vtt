DUDE, WE'RE SO HIRED.

07:07.790 --> 07:09.109
WE ARE?

07:09.160 --> 07:10.752
WATCH THIS.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.755
EXCUSE ME.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.428
MR. HORNSTOCK, RIGHT?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.392
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
MY NAME'S SHAWN SPENCER.

07:18.430 --> 07:20.796
I'M THE LEAD PSYCHIC DETECTIVE
AT THE SBPD.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.603
UH, YEAH, UM,
I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

07:22.640 --> 07:23.629
I CAN SEE.

07:23.670 --> 07:24.705
YOU'RE DOING
A BANG-UP JOB.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.162
PLEASE DON'T STOP.
I JUST...

07:26.210 --> 07:27.370
I THINK MAYBE
YOU SHOULD BE

07:27.410 --> 07:28.331
A LITTLE CAREFUL.

07:28.380 --> 07:29.335
OH?

07:29.380 --> 07:30.938
OF JUROR NUMBER FOUR.

07:30.980 --> 07:31.947
JUROR...

07:31.980 --> 07:33.538
OH, YEAH? WHY IS THAT?

07:33.580 --> 07:36.378
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU
REALLY BOTHERS HER.

07:36.420 --> 07:38.945
I THINK SOMETHING ABOUT HER
BOTHERS ME.

07:38.990 --> 07:39.979
SHE'S BEEN
FROWNING AT ME

07:40.020 --> 07:41.055
THE WHOLE TIME.

07:41.090 --> 07:42.352
I HAVEN'T EVEN
GONE UP YET.

07:42.390 --> 07:43.618
HERE'S THE THING--
SHE'S A FASHION MAVEN.

07:43.660 --> 07:44.729
SHE HAS A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR APPEARANCE,

07:44.760 --> 07:45.784
AND UNTIL YOU CHANGE IT,

07:45.830 --> 07:46.797
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S GOING TO LISTEN

07:46.830 --> 07:47.797
TO A WORD YOU SAY.

07:47.830 --> 07:48.922
MY APPEARANCE?

07:48.960 --> 07:50.029
THE MANNER
IN WHICH YOU APPEAR.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.264
YOUR "LOOK."

07:51.300 --> 07:52.733
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS,

07:52.770 --> 07:54.260
BUT LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.393
GIVE ME THE 360 CAT DANCE
REAL FAST, HUH?

07:56.440 --> 07:57.304
EXCUSE ME?

07:57.340 --> 07:58.204
TWIRL IT UP FOR ME,

07:58.240 --> 07:59.138
AND THEN TWIRL IT RIGHT BACK.

08:00.310 --> 08:01.379
THERE IT IS.

08:01.410 --> 08:02.547
AND BACK.

08:02.580 --> 08:03.706
SUIT. PLEATED.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.876
I WOULD'VE GONE
WITH A TH REE-BUTTON,

08:04.910 --> 08:06.047
MAYBE SOMETHING
IN A WOOL-COTTON BLEND,

08:06.080 --> 08:07.809
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

08:07.850 --> 08:09.317
SIDEBURNS, CHECK.

08:09.350 --> 08:10.089
HAIR, BOLD.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.712
STROKES, HIVES. ..

08:11.750 --> 08:12.910
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.154
THE SHOES,
NOT A SPIT SHINE,

08:14.190 --> 08:15.452
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
GOTTEN UP YET,

08:15.490 --> 08:16.787
SO I CAN'T
MAKE HEADS OR--

08:16.830 --> 08:18.980
WHOA...
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.156
I THINK IT'S THE TIE.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.258
WHAT? MY TIE?

08:21.300 --> 08:22.392
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY TIE?

08:22.430 --> 08:23.966
WELL, IT'S
A LITTLE BIT...

08:24.000 --> 08:25.069
PFFBLT.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.328
PFFBLT?

08:26.370 --> 08:28.531
PFFBLT.

08:28.570 --> 08:30.629
WELL, LOOK, IT'S NOT,
LIKE, MY FAVORITE TIE.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.501
I'M SO GLAD
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

08:32.540 --> 08:34.770
GUS... QUICK, GIVE ME YOUR TIE.

08:34.810 --> 08:36.175
I'M NOT GIVING YOU MY TIE.
IT'S A GOOD TIE.

08:36.210 --> 08:37.279
GIVE ME THE TIE, PLEASE.

08:37.310 --> 08:38.470
IT'S A THOMAS PINK TIE.

08:38.510 --> 08:39.738
ONE SEC.

08:39.780 --> 08:40.974
[SHARPLY]:
WHY WON'T YOU GIVE ME THE TIE?

08:42.180 --> 08:44.410
[WHISPERING ANGRILY]

08:46.020 --> 08:47.453
LOOK HIGH, REACH LOW.

08:47.490 --> 08:48.514
GOT IT.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.755
WE'RE ALSO
GOING TO TAKE THIS,

08:50.790 --> 08:52.326
PRIMARILY BECAUSE
IT'S COVERED IN SWEAT,

08:52.360 --> 08:54.499
BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT READS
"CRUISE SHIP WAITER" TO ME.

08:54.530 --> 08:57.658
SHIP?
GO GET 'EM.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.438
AND SO I WILL
DEMONSTRATE TO THE COURT

09:02.470 --> 09:04.836
THAT SANDRA PANITCH
IS AN UPSTANDING CITIZEN

09:04.870 --> 09:06.201
WITH NO CRIMINAL RECORD...

09:07.440 --> 09:10.000
AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
HAS RUSHED TO THE PROSECUTION

09:10.050 --> 09:11.540
OF AN INNOCENT WOMAN.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.115
ARE YOU FINISHED NOW,
MR. HORNSTOCK?

09:16.150 --> 09:17.447
HMM?

09:17.490 --> 09:18.582
UH... OH, YES.

09:18.620 --> 09:19.689
YES, YOUR HONOR.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.789
BRILLIANT.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.924
WELL, THINGS ARE
FINALLY MOVING ALONG.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.656
COURT WILL RECESSES
TILL AFTER LUNCH.

09:28.630 --> 09:29.790
DID YOU SEE THAT?

09:29.830 --> 09:31.058
THAT WAS AMAZING.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.124
DID YOU SEE THAT?
THAT WAS A WHOLE 180.

09:32.170 --> 09:33.899
IT'S A PRETTY AMAZING TIE.

09:33.940 --> 09:35.396
HEY, STRONG SHAG, STRONG TIE...

09:35.440 --> 09:37.135
STRONG PERSON.

09:37.170 --> 09:38.762
UH, YOU KNOW, GUYS,

09:38.810 --> 09:40.038
I WOULD HIRE YOU
IN A SECOND.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.809
IT'S JUST...

09:41.840 --> 09:43.171
WELL, I...

09:43.210 --> 09:44.700
I DON'T HAVE
THE AUTHORIZATION.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.218
MY FIRM
DOESN'T REALLY BELIEVE IN...

09:47.250 --> 09:48.217
WINNING?

09:48.250 --> 09:49.114
NO.

09:49.150 --> 09:50.048
MERMAIDS?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.045
NO.
THE MINOTAUR.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.580
NO. ME.

09:52.620 --> 09:53.985
YEAH, UH...

09:54.020 --> 09:55.282
AT LEAST, NOT ANYMORE.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.685
NO, THERE'S NO "BUTS" HERE.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.083
A LOT OF THE CASES
MY PARTNER GUS AND I TAKE

09:58.130 --> 09:59.358
WE DO FOR FREE.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.425
IT'S CALLED "PRO BONO."

10:00.460 --> 10:01.688
GUS.
WHAT?

10:01.730 --> 10:03.459
A LITTLE DECORUM.
WE'RE IN A COURTROOM.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.722
CONGRATULATIONS.

10:05.770 --> 10:08.466
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF
A COUPLE OF LEGAL CONSULTANTS.

10:10.870 --> 10:11.837
WOW.

10:11.870 --> 10:12.973
OH, BOY.

10:13.010 --> 10:14.102
DID HE JUST
GRAB YOUR FIST?

10:14.140 --> 10:15.505
AND THEN
HE SHOOK IT.

10:15.540 --> 10:16.802
WELL, WELL, WELL.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.909
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?
HI, JULES.

10:18.950 --> 10:20.247
PLEASE TELL ME

10:20.280 --> 10:21.770
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THOSE
COURTROOM GROUPIES

10:21.820 --> 10:23.378
THAT BOUNCES
FROM TRIAL TO TRIAL...

10:23.420 --> 10:24.512
WAIT A SECOND.

10:24.550 --> 10:25.949
WAS THAT YOU

10:25.990 --> 10:27.309
AT THE MICHAEL JACKSON HEARING

10:27.360 --> 10:28.679
WITH THE SEQUINED GLOVE
AND THE SHIRT THAT SAID,

10:28.720 --> 10:30.028
"PLEASE FREE
THE MAN IN THE MIRROR?"

10:31.230 --> 10:32.527
THAT'S ACTUALLY
REALLY FUNNY, SHAWN.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.494
DETECTIVE LASSITER
IS THE ONE

10:34.530 --> 10:35.827
WHO ACTUALLY
MADE THE ARREST

10:35.860 --> 10:37.259
OF SANDRA PANITCH.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.597
SEE, THAT MAKES IT MY CASE.

10:38.630 --> 10:41.360
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.
IT'S ALSO OUR CASE.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.607
YEAH, WE JUST SIGNED ON
AS LEGAL CONSULTANTS

10:43.640 --> 10:44.766
TO THE DEFENSE.

10:44.810 --> 10:45.606
JUST NOW.

10:45.640 --> 10:46.607
YOU WILL SELL

10:46.640 --> 10:47.607
YOUR LITTLE SIDESHOW ACT

10:47.640 --> 10:48.732
TO ANYONE
WHO WILL LISTEN.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.048
JUST DON'T SCREW THIS ONE UP.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.571
"DON'T SCREW THIS UP"?

10:55.620 --> 10:56.780
HEY, LASSIE,

10:56.820 --> 10:58.913
THAT REALLY WASN'T
MUCH OF A PUTDOWN.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.054
IN FACT, IT WAS...

11:01.090 --> 11:03.354
SOMEWHAT INSPIRING.

11:03.390 --> 11:04.425
LASS!

11:04.460 --> 11:05.779
LET'S ROLL THAT BACK!

11:10.170 --> 11:12.730
I DON'T KNOW.
IT FEELS A LITTLE WEIRD.

11:12.770 --> 11:14.260
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD
REALLY BE SITTING HERE.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.631
THIS IS YOUR OFFICE.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.103
UH, YEAH, THIS ISN'T MY OFFICE.

11:17.140 --> 11:18.562
YOU DIDN'T LIKE MY MINE.

11:18.610 --> 11:19.702
THIS IS CARTER JARECKI'S OFFICE,

11:19.740 --> 11:20.934
ONE OF THE PARTNERS.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.039
ACTUALLY, HE'S THE GUY

11:23.080 --> 11:24.638
WHO TOOK THE CASE
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

11:24.680 --> 11:26.238
BUT THEN DUMPED IT ON ME

11:26.280 --> 11:27.816
WHEN HE DECIDED
IT WAS A LOST CAUSE.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.317
YOU SEE, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

11:29.350 --> 11:31.648
WHY DIDN'T YOU STAND UP
TO THAT GUY?

11:31.690 --> 11:32.918
FOR THE WORST REASON POSSIBLE.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.780
I ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THIS WOMAN IS INNOCENT.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.378
NOW, CAN WE PLEASE GO

11:36.420 --> 11:37.956
BEFORE JARECKI GETS BACK?

11:40.430 --> 11:43.490
CARTER JARECKI JUST LEFT
FOR A NOONER WITH HIS MISTRESS.

11:43.530 --> 11:44.929
WE HAVE AT LEAST TWO HOURS.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.666
MAYBE AN HOUR AND A HALF.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.507
HORNSTOCK, I THINK
YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL

11:53.540 --> 11:55.508
TO BE A FANTASTIC LAWYER.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.802
YOU JUST NEED
CONFIDENCE.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.147
AFTER ALL,
THAT'S YOUR NAME ON THE DOOR.

11:58.180 --> 11:59.147
NOW, COME ON.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.215
OH, NO.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.741
NO, NONE OF THOSE HORNSTOCKS
ARE ME.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.712
THE FIRST ONE
IS MY GRANDFATHER.

12:04.750 --> 12:05.819
HE FOUNDED THE FIRM.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.489
THE MIDDLE ONE IS MY FATHER,

12:08.520 --> 12:09.487
THEN MY BROTHER.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.487
WOW.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.519
A WHOLE FAMILY OF LAWYERS?

12:11.560 --> 12:13.699
YEAH, EVEN MY SISTER.

12:13.730 --> 12:15.322
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
SHE DIDN'T MAKE THE DOOR.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.897
SHE'S BIEDERMAN.

12:17.930 --> 12:19.363
IT'S HER MARRIED NAME.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.633
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO NEED
TO TAKE A LOOK

12:22.670 --> 12:24.331
AT YOUR WITNESS LISTS
AND YOUR DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS.

12:24.370 --> 12:26.770
OH, YEAH, WELL,
I'VE PREPARED ALL THAT FOR YOU.

12:26.810 --> 12:28.334
I HAVE, UH...

12:28.380 --> 12:31.349
HERE ARE ALL THE FORENSIC
AND ARREST REPORTS,

12:31.380 --> 12:33.018
AND I DEPOSED SEVERAL
OF HALE'S CO-WORKERS

12:33.050 --> 12:34.039
FROM CHANNEL 8,

12:34.080 --> 12:35.718
MOSTLY TO REFUTE
TIM ELIN ES

12:35.750 --> 12:38.048
AND FOR CHARACTER TESTIMONY.

12:38.090 --> 12:38.943
CAN WE SEE THOSE?

12:38.990 --> 12:40.617
SURE, YEAH. HERE'S...

12:44.630 --> 12:45.585
OH, YES,

12:45.630 --> 12:46.927
AND MAYBE LATER ON

12:46.960 --> 12:48.655
WE CAN READ THE PHONE BOOK
JUST FOR FUN.

12:48.700 --> 12:49.758
HORNSTOCK...

12:50.630 --> 12:53.064
I HAVE GOT TO DO WHAT I DO.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.863
THAT'S NOT THE WAY I DO IT.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.197
I NEED TO SEE,

12:56.240 --> 12:58.367
FEEL, AND SMELL PEOPLE

12:58.410 --> 13:00.173
IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.371
SMELL THEM?

13:04.180 --> 13:05.772
SO THIS IS WHERE THE, UH...

13:05.810 --> 13:07.675
THE CRIME TOOK PLACE.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.608
SO JUST FEEL FREE
TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND,

13:09.650 --> 13:11.049
SO DO...

13:11.090 --> 13:12.682
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU DO.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.256
THANK YOU.

13:18.660 --> 13:19.627
LET'S WALK THE CRIME,
SHALL WE?

13:19.660 --> 13:20.991
YEAH.

13:21.030 --> 13:23.692
PROBABLY CAME IN
FROM THAT SAME ENTRANCE WE DID.

13:23.730 --> 13:25.220
FOUND THEIR WAY OVER HERE

13:25.270 --> 13:28.797
TO THE CHANNEL 8
ANCHOR DESK AREA.

13:28.840 --> 13:29.909
OF COURSE,

13:29.940 --> 13:31.908
THE BODY WAS FOUND...

13:31.940 --> 13:33.874
HERE.

13:33.910 --> 13:34.979
IT WAS A SHORT WALK.

13:35.010 --> 13:36.034
YEAH.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.640
PRISCILLA, WHAT ARE
THESE GREEN WALLS FOR?

13:38.680 --> 13:40.671
OH, WELL,
WE DO IT ALL IN GREEN SCREEN.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.415
CAN YOU SHOW ME
HOW THAT WORKS, PLEASE?

13:42.450 --> 13:43.678
SURE.

13:43.720 --> 13:44.709
I JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO SIT IN FRONT.

13:44.750 --> 13:47.014
GUS, GO SIT OVER THERE.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.016
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT THERE
JUST BECAUSE YOU TELL ME TO.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.557
FINE. I'LL PLAY ANCHORMAN.

13:51.590 --> 13:53.251
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

13:57.800 --> 13:58.926
OKAY, SO WE JUST HAVE TO GO

13:58.970 --> 14:00.039
TO THE CONTROL ROOM.

14:00.070 --> 14:01.435
IT'S JUST THIS WAY.

14:01.470 --> 14:02.539
OKAY.

14:02.570 --> 14:03.730
BL-BL-BAH.

14:03.770 --> 14:05.260
GAH-GAH-GAH-GAH-GAH. ..

14:05.310 --> 14:06.800
YOU KNOW WHEN
WE'RE WATCHING THE WEATHER GUY

14:06.840 --> 14:09.001
AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOT,
LIKE, RAINFALL BEHIND HIM,

14:09.040 --> 14:10.473
OR SNOW OR HAIL?

14:10.510 --> 14:12.148
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

14:12.180 --> 14:13.112
WELL, THE GREEN
BACKGROUND

14:13.150 --> 14:14.310
WORKS AS A BLANK SLATE.

14:14.350 --> 14:16.545
THEN I JUST RUN IT
THROUGH THE BOARD,

14:16.580 --> 14:19.287
AND PRESTO.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.150
A COMPOSITE
OF THE TWO IMAGES

14:20.190 --> 14:21.487
IS MADE.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.714
OH, OH, OH.
CAN WE GET SOUND IN HERE?

14:22.760 --> 14:24.489
YEAH. YEAH, SURE.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.485
[GUS]: BL-BL-BAH.

14:25.530 --> 14:26.849
IN LOCAL NEWS,

14:26.900 --> 14:28.788
A PHARMACEUTICAL REPRESENTATIVE
AGAIN PROVIDED

14:28.830 --> 14:31.663
THE KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION
IN A BAFFLING POLICE CASE...

14:31.700 --> 14:33.031
BUT RAN SCREAMING
FROM THE SCENE

14:33.070 --> 14:35.595
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL

14:35.640 --> 14:37.562
BEFORE HE COULD MAKE
A STATEMENT.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.032
THAT WAS ONE TIME!
ONE TIME!

14:39.070 --> 14:40.503
I DON'T LIKE DEAD BODIES.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

14:40.540 --> 14:41.837
NOW, STOP BRINGING THAT UP.

14:44.780 --> 14:47.112
HELLO. THIS IS YOUR LOCAL NEWS.

14:47.150 --> 14:48.447
BL-BL-BAH. ..

14:48.480 --> 14:50.084
THIS NEXT OFFICE
WAS JACKSON HALE'S.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.417
I GOT TO TELL YOU GUYS,

14:51.450 --> 14:52.678
EVERYBODY'S BEEN ACTING
A LITTLE WEIRD

14:52.720 --> 14:53.812
SINCE IT HAPPENED.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.054
IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME.

14:55.090 --> 14:56.079
OH...

14:56.120 --> 14:57.849
RUBEN...

14:57.890 --> 14:59.755
THIS IS SHAWN SPENCER
AND BURTON GUSTER.

14:59.790 --> 15:01.553
THEY'RE WORKING
ON JACKSON HALE'S CASE.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.851
THIS IS RUBEN LEONARD.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.527
HE'S A LAB METEOROLOGIST
ON JACKSON'S TEAM.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.696
WAS.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.228
I WAS JUST...

15:08.270 --> 15:10.033
SORTING AND PACKING

15:10.070 --> 15:12.265
SOME OF HIS
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS

15:12.310 --> 15:14.130
TO SEND TO HIS FAMILY.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.579
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

15:15.610 --> 15:16.736
THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL.

15:16.780 --> 15:17.439
THANK YOU.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.777
IT REMINDS ME

15:18.810 --> 15:20.641
OF A HOT LITTLE SENORITA
I MET THERE.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.647
SHE WAS SERVING
FRIED JALAPENOS--

15:21.680 --> 15:22.647
EXCUSE ME.

15:22.680 --> 15:23.749
SURE. SURE, SURE.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.246
ANYWAY. .. SORRY.

15:25.290 --> 15:26.780
SO, IF YOU'LL NOTICE
THAT WE'VE GOT...

15:26.820 --> 15:27.809
DID YOU WORK
WITH JACKSON HALE LONG?

15:27.860 --> 15:29.612
SIX YEARS.

15:30.860 --> 15:32.452
HE WAS A GREAT MAN.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.799
I HAD A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HIM.

15:39.930 --> 15:41.795
HE WAS JUST SO GOOD
AT WHAT HE DID.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.400
...BECAUSE I GUARANTEE

15:44.440 --> 15:45.634
IT'S RAINING
CATS AND DOGS...

15:45.670 --> 15:47.729
A BROADCASTING TREASURE.

15:50.980 --> 15:51.969
YEAH.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.240
DUDE...

15:58.290 --> 15:59.314
RUBEN'S IN THERE

15:59.350 --> 16:00.681
DESTROYING
HALE'S AWARDS.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.914
WHAT?
YEAH.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.052
UNLESS HE'S REALLY
OFFENDED

16:03.090 --> 16:04.250
BY THE SHODDY ENGRAVING
ON THE PLAQUE,

16:04.290 --> 16:06.485
THAT GUY HATES JACKSON HALE.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.828
I'M NOT SAYING HE DID IT,
BUT...

16:08.860 --> 16:10.725
REASONABLE DOUBT, ANYONE?

16:15.100 --> 16:16.431
OKAY, MS. PANITCH.

16:16.470 --> 16:19.109
PLEASE, WALK US
THROUGH THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME.

16:19.140 --> 16:20.334
WELL...

16:20.380 --> 16:23.144
I NEVER MET MR. HALE
BEFORE THAT NIGHT.

16:23.180 --> 16:24.909
I JUST MOVED HERE
FROM WISCONSIN.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.975
IT WASN'T LIKE
I WAS A FAN OF HIS.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.477
I ONLY VAGUELY KNEW
HE WAS A WEATHERMAN.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.887
SO WE TALKED,
AND HE WAS CHARMING...

16:32.920 --> 16:34.410
SO THE SCRATCHES
ON JACKSON HALE'S BACK,

16:34.460 --> 16:35.654
AND HIS SKIN
UNDER YOUR FINGERNAILS,

16:35.690 --> 16:37.089
THIS ALL HAPPENED
DURING THE SEX...

16:38.630 --> 16:39.983
AS WELL AS THE BRUISES
ON YOUR ARM?

16:40.030 --> 16:41.759
IT GOT PASSIONATE.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.062
I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING

16:43.100 --> 16:44.692
UNTIL I WOKE UP
THE NEXT MORNING.

16:44.730 --> 16:45.992
WITH HIS BLOOD ON YOU?

16:46.030 --> 16:47.588
AND THEN YOU FLED
TO THE PARKING LOT?

16:47.640 --> 16:48.891
LOOK, I WAS SCARED.

16:49.840 --> 16:50.909
I KNOW

16:50.940 --> 16:53.135
HOW BAD ALL OF THIS
LOOKS, I DO,

16:53.180 --> 16:56.832
BUT I SWEAR
I DID NOT MURDER ANYONE.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.870
DO YOU GUYS BELIEVE ME?

16:59.910 --> 17:01.116
DO YOU?

17:01.150 --> 17:02.117
OF COURSE WE DO, SANDRA.

17:02.150 --> 17:03.139
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.342
COUNSELOR.
YES.

17:05.390 --> 17:06.812
WOULD YOU PLEASE RETIRE WITH ME
TO THE HALLWAY

17:06.850 --> 17:09.455
WHERE WE CAN EXCHANGE WORDS
IN HUSHED TONES?

17:12.460 --> 17:13.427
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:13.460 --> 17:14.722
WHAT?

17:14.760 --> 17:16.250
YOU ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE DEMONSTRATING

17:16.300 --> 17:17.790
CONFIDENCE AND SWAGGER
FOR HORNSTOCK.

17:17.830 --> 17:19.161
INSTEAD, YOU'RE POKING HOLES
IN OUR CASE

17:19.200 --> 17:20.337
AND YOU'RE SCARING
OUR DEFENDANT.

17:20.370 --> 17:21.860
HERE ARE THE FACTS, SHAWN.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.663
ALL WE KNOW ABOUT SANDRA
IS WHAT SHE HAS TOLD US.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.109
I THINK WE NEED TO DO
SOME INVESTIGATING.

17:25.140 --> 17:26.960
I BELIEVE HER.
HORNSTOCK BELIEVES HER.

17:27.010 --> 17:28.375
WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED?
WE NEED PROOF, SHAWN.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.298
LOOK, RIGHT HERE
IN THIS BOOK,

17:30.350 --> 17:31.840
COREY V. BOLEVICKER
IN 1955.

17:31.880 --> 17:35.270
THE KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE
WAS HALF-MELTED CANDLESTICKS.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.719
WE NEED EVIDENCE.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.547
WHERE ARE OUR CAN DLESTICKS,
SHAWN?

17:38.590 --> 17:40.353
MAYBE YOU JUST
JUMPED OVER THEM.
WHAT?

17:40.390 --> 17:42.017
BE NIMBLE? BE QUICK?

17:42.060 --> 17:43.186
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GIVE ME ANYTHING?

17:43.230 --> 17:44.219
NOW, CAN WE PLEASE--

17:47.630 --> 17:48.597
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

17:48.630 --> 17:49.597
CHECK OUT THE JUDGE.

17:49.630 --> 17:50.722
HE'S GRABBING HIS BACK.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.522
NO WONDER
HE'S SO GRUMPY.

17:52.570 --> 17:53.696
HE'S NOT GRABBING
HIS BACK.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.866
HE'S GRABBING
HIS KIDNEYS.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.300
HE PROBABLY HAS
A KIDNEY STONE.

17:57.340 --> 17:58.307
DUDE, NICE.

17:58.340 --> 17:59.307
THANK YOU.

17:59.340 --> 18:01.035
PLEASE STATE
TO THE COURT

18:01.080 --> 18:03.947
WHAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH MR. HALE WAS.

18:03.980 --> 18:05.242
IT WAS PROFESSIONAL.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.144
HE WAS MY BOSS.

18:06.180 --> 18:07.716
I WAS HIS RECEPTIONIST.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.342
AND AS THE CHANNEL 8
RECEPTIONIST,

18:09.380 --> 18:10.711
MS. OSTERMAN,

18:10.750 --> 18:13.116
IF PEOPLE WERE TO CALL
JACKSON HALE,

18:13.160 --> 18:14.889
YOU TOOK THOSE CALLS?

18:14.920 --> 18:16.148
I DID.

18:16.190 --> 18:18.078
AND DID YOU
RECEIVE ANY CALLS

18:18.130 --> 18:19.552
FROM THE DEFENDANT,
SANDRA PANITCH,

18:19.590 --> 18:21.228
AT ANY TIME?

18:21.260 --> 18:22.989
OH, NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NO.

18:23.030 --> 18:24.395
BUT OTHER WOMEN
WOULD CALL?

18:24.430 --> 18:25.829
SURE.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.132
WAS JACKSON HALE

18:27.170 --> 18:28.569
SLEEPING WITH THESE WOMEN?

18:28.600 --> 18:29.430
YOUR HONOR.
OBJECTION,

18:29.470 --> 18:30.835
H EARSAY.

18:30.870 --> 18:32.406
I'LL ALLOW THE QUESTION.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.705
UH, WELL, I CAN ONLY SAY
THAT I FIELDED MANY CALLS,

18:35.740 --> 18:38.538
AND SOMETIMES I HELPED
TO JUGGLE THESE CALLS.

18:38.580 --> 18:40.070
HE WAS A HANDSOME MAN.

18:40.110 --> 18:42.510
HE CERTAINLY WAS.

18:45.420 --> 18:48.082
THANK YOU, MS. OSTERMAN.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.849
YOU MAY STEP DOWN,
MS. OSTERMAN.

18:49.890 --> 18:51.187
THAN KS.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.379
[PROSECUTOR]:
YOUR HONOR,

18:52.430 --> 18:53.351
THE STATE
REQUESTS A MOMENT

18:53.400 --> 18:55.493
TO PREPARE FOR OUR NEXT WITNESS.

18:55.530 --> 18:56.827
"HE CERTAINLY WAS"?

18:56.860 --> 18:58.168
WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU WERE ROLLING--

18:58.200 --> 18:59.167
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.235
IT SOUNDED GOOD IN MY HEAD.

19:00.270 --> 19:02.261
YOU HAVE A GREAT
SUPPORT SYSTEM--

19:02.300 --> 19:03.528
IT GIVES YOU
THAT EASY CONFIDENCE--

19:03.570 --> 19:04.707
BUT MY FATHER

19:04.740 --> 19:05.764
HASN'T BEEN TO COURT ONCE,

19:05.810 --> 19:07.334
NOT ONE OF MY TRIALS.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.574
YOU'VE BEEN HERE ONE DAY,
YOUR FATHER'S ALREADY HERE.

19:08.610 --> 19:10.601
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:10.650 --> 19:11.571
NO, I MET HIM OUTSIDE.

19:11.610 --> 19:12.599
HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.278
[CLEARING THROAT]:
YOUR HONOR...

19:23.330 --> 19:24.957
THE DEFENSE WOULD LIKE TO CALL
FOR A RECESS.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.025
EXCUSE ME.

19:26.060 --> 19:27.357
WHO ARE YOU?

19:27.400 --> 19:28.958
I'M SORRY, YOUR HONOR.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.228
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.567
I'M A PSYCHIC
LEGAL CONSULTANT

19:31.600 --> 19:32.726
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

19:32.770 --> 19:33.759
WE WERE NOT MADE AWARE

19:33.800 --> 19:34.869
THAT A PSYCHIC
WAS HIRED ON THIS CASE.

19:34.900 --> 19:35.935
APPROACH THE BENCH.

19:35.970 --> 19:37.301
ALL OF YOU.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.228
IT'S OKAY.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.949
YOUR HONOR, THE PEOPLE
QUESTION HIS VALIDITY.

19:43.980 --> 19:46.039
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
THAT'S HURTFUL.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.047
LOOK, I KNOW

19:47.080 --> 19:48.172
YOU'RE THE BIG, BAD
PROSECUTOR

19:48.220 --> 19:49.915
WITH THE SWEET HEAD,

19:49.950 --> 19:50.917
BUT IS THIS TONE
REALLY NECESSARY?

19:50.950 --> 19:51.917
NO.

19:51.950 --> 19:53.258
I AM A LEGITIMATE CONSULTANT.

19:53.290 --> 19:54.211
I HAVE BEEN HIRED OFTEN

19:54.260 --> 19:55.409
BY THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT,

19:55.460 --> 19:57.052
AND THERE IS
A HIGH-RANKING DETECTIVE

19:57.090 --> 19:58.785
IN THIS VERY COURTROOM RIGHT NOW

19:58.830 --> 20:01.390
WHO WILL VOUCH
FOR MY VALIDITY.

20:01.430 --> 20:02.397
WHO IS THIS?

20:02.430 --> 20:04.227
HE'S RIGHT THERE.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.659
THE WISPY YET COMMANDING
IRISH FELLOW

20:06.700 --> 20:08.236
WHO LOOKS LIKE
HE'S BEEN SUCKING

20:08.270 --> 20:09.089
ON SOUR PATCH KIDS.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.129
WOULD YOU STAND

20:10.170 --> 20:11.501
AND STATE YOUR NAME
FOR THE COURT?

20:13.410 --> 20:15.503
CARLTON LASSITER,
SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT,

20:15.540 --> 20:16.768
YOUR HONOR.

20:16.810 --> 20:18.641
HEAD DETECTIVE,
11 YEARS...

20:18.680 --> 20:20.341
THIS MAY.

20:20.380 --> 20:21.415
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
TO INFORM THE COURT

20:21.450 --> 20:22.610
OF YOUR FAVORITE COLOR AS WELL.

20:22.650 --> 20:23.617
THE POINT IS

20:23.650 --> 20:25.140
DO YOU KNOW
THIS MAN?

20:25.190 --> 20:27.010
I DO.

20:27.050 --> 20:29.280
AND HAS HE WORKED ON CASES
FOR THE DEPARTMENT?

20:29.320 --> 20:30.628
HE HAS.

20:30.660 --> 20:31.684
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.027
AND HE WAS HELPFUL?

20:34.030 --> 20:35.520
ABSOLUTELY.

20:38.230 --> 20:39.629
DID HE JUST SAY "ABSOLUTELY"
WITH A LITTLE HALF-SMILE?

20:39.670 --> 20:41.092
I'D LIKE THAT PRINTED OUT,
PLEASE

20:41.140 --> 20:43.529
I'M THINKING OF SHELLACKING IT
ON A NICE PIECE OF MAPLE,

20:43.570 --> 20:44.730
MAYBE DOING A LITTLE DECOUPAGE.

20:44.770 --> 20:46.704
YOUR HONOR,
AS YOU CAN SEE,

20:46.740 --> 20:47.877
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR BREAKING...

20:47.910 --> 20:49.707
MANY CASES
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

20:49.740 --> 20:51.344
WELL, GUESS WHAT--
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE

20:51.380 --> 20:54.042
OR WHAT YOU'VE DONE
FOR THE STATE.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.275
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN THAT PSYCHIC MUMBO-JUMBO,

20:56.320 --> 20:57.742
AND IT'S NOT WELCOME
IN MY COURT.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.212
"MUMBO-JUMBO"?

21:00.490 --> 21:02.185
OH, YOU POOR, POOR MAN.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.209
NO WONDER.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.727
YOU'RE...

21:04.760 --> 21:07.024
[QUIETLY]:
PASSING A KIDNEY STONE

21:07.060 --> 21:08.220
CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL.

21:08.260 --> 21:09.989
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
I NEVER TOLD ANYONE.

21:10.030 --> 21:12.123
YOU TELL ME IF I'M
OVERSTEPPING MY BOUNDS,

21:12.170 --> 21:14.229
BUT I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST
AN OLD HOME REMEDY

21:14.270 --> 21:15.362
THAT DID WONDERS
FOR MY AUNT DELORES.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.231
YOU SIMPLY GARGLE
WITH SOME MINERAL WATER,

21:17.270 --> 21:18.862
FOLLOWED UP
WITH SOME RAW GREENS.

21:18.910 --> 21:19.968
ME, PERSONALLY,

21:20.010 --> 21:21.705
I'D GO
WITH ASPARAGUS TIPS.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.401
THAT WAY, LATER ON...

21:23.450 --> 21:25.577
WHEN YOU'RE MAKING WATER,

21:25.610 --> 21:28.147
YOU'LL KNOW
THAT IT'S WORKING.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.317
LET'S PROCEED WITH THE TRIAL.

21:36.490 --> 21:37.787
OKAY, YOU GOT ME.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.229
I'M STARTLED.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:39.260 --> 21:40.284
MAYBE WE'RE BOTH PSYCHICS.

21:40.330 --> 21:41.888
I AM SERIOUS.

27:19.070 --> 27:21.265
NEVER TO HAVE SEEN
OR TOUCHED THE WEAPON.

EVEN THOUGH HER FINGERPRINTS
WERE ALL OVER IT.

36:40.030 --> 36:41.179
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT, YOUNG MAN.

36:41.230 --> 36:43.221
WHERE DID YOU ATTEND LAW SCHOOL?

36:43.260 --> 36:44.522
JUST SIXTH GRADE LAW,
YOUR HONOR,

36:44.570 --> 36:46.322
BUT IT WAS
AN ACCELERATED PROGRAM.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.862
IT IS UP TO MY DISCRETION
TO ALLOW ANY TESTIMONY

36:50.900 --> 36:52.731
THAT MAY SPEAK
TO THE TRUTH OF THIS CASE.

36:52.770 --> 36:54.931

37:08.990 --> 37:10.582
YOU DIDN'T SLEEP
WITH JACKSON HALE,

37:10.620 --> 37:12.326
BUT JACKSON HALE

EVERYBODY...

37:17.130 --> 37:18.666

37:18.700 --> 37:20.327
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

37:20.370 --> 37:22.668
YOU COULDN'T TAKE IT,
COULD YOU?

37:22.700 --> 37:25.362
HIM WALKING BY EVERY SINGLE DAY
AND NEVER NOTICING YOU.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.763
NOT ONCE.

37:26.810 --> 37:28.471
REPEATEDLY CHOOSING

37:28.510 --> 37:29.670
TO SLEEP WITH WOMEN

37:29.710 --> 37:31.109
LIKE THE DEFENDANT,
SANDRA PANITCH.

37:31.140 --> 37:32.141
WELL, THAT'S...
THAT'S NOT...

37:32.180 --> 37:33.340
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

37:34.050 --> 37:35.119
THAT VIDEO WILL SHOW

37:35.150 --> 37:37.015
JACKSON HALE BEING MURDERED,

37:37.050 --> 37:41.111
BUT NOT
BY SANDRA PANITCH.

37:41.150 --> 37:42.708
BY YOU.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.852
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
I MEAN...

37:43.890 --> 37:44.857
THIS IS...
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

37:44.890 --> 37:46.619
I FEEL THE TAPE

37:46.660 --> 37:47.627
IS THE PROOF!

37:47.660 --> 37:49.958
THE TAPE IS THE PUDDING!

37:50.000 --> 37:51.058
YOUR HONOR,
I SAID OBJECTION.

37:51.100 --> 37:53.728
I DEMAND YOU GET HIM
TO STOP THAT.

37:53.770 --> 37:55.067
SIT DOWN.

37:55.100 --> 37:56.965
DO YOU NEED A TUTORIAL

37:57.000 --> 37:58.228
IN RULE 775?

37:58.270 --> 37:59.601
MR. RIGGS...

37:59.640 --> 38:01.335
CAN YOU PLEASE
PLAY THE TAPE AGAIN?

38:04.080 --> 38:05.240
THANK YOU.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.599
UH, COULD YOU TAKE IT BACK
A LITTLE BIT?

38:06.650 --> 38:07.605
AND FORWARD.

38:07.650 --> 38:08.617
I'M SORRY. IT WAS FORWARD.

38:08.650 --> 38:09.878
AND BACK.

38:09.920 --> 38:10.739
JUST FORWARD.

THAT.

38:27.070 --> 38:28.264
THAT RIGHT THERE.

38:28.300 --> 38:29.460
IT'S A CLOUD.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.660
NOT A CLOUD.

38:30.700 --> 38:32.008
A SHADOW.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.905
A SHADOW...

38:33.940 --> 38:35.305
OF A HUMAN PERSON.

38:38.380 --> 38:40.940
YOU WERE WEARING THOSE GLASSES
THAT NIGHT,

38:40.980 --> 38:44.245
MAKING IT UNMISTAKABLE

38:44.280 --> 38:46.111
THAT YOU WERE THERE.

38:46.150 --> 38:47.981
THAT...

38:48.020 --> 38:49.681
IS YOUR SHADOW, PRISCILLA.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.483
YOU WATCH ED.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.327
YOU WAITED.

38:53.360 --> 38:56.249
WAITED FOR THEM
TO DROP OUT OF FRAME,

38:56.300 --> 38:57.255
THEN BAM,
ON THE HEAD TO SANDRA,

38:57.300 --> 38:58.255
AND...

38:58.300 --> 38:59.494
[MAKES WET STABBING SOUND]

38:59.530 --> 39:00.929

39:03.670 --> 39:04.830
YOU DIDN'T THINK

39:04.870 --> 39:05.837
THERE WAS ANY WAY
YOU COULD BE BLAMED...

39:07.810 --> 39:09.209
BECAUSE CLOUDS
DON'T KILL PEOPLE.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.574
PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE.

39:12.610 --> 39:13.372
[YELPS]

39:13.410 --> 39:16.243
BUT THIS WAS A CRIME OF PASSION.

39:16.280 --> 39:18.214
BUT NOT BECAUSE
HE LOVED YOU...

39:20.720 --> 39:22.051
BUT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T.

39:23.490 --> 39:24.684
HE WALKED BY ME
IN THE HALLWAY

39:25.830 --> 39:28.219
LIKE I DIDN'T EXIST.

39:28.260 --> 39:29.693
LIKE I WAS INVISIBLE.

39:29.730 --> 39:34.019
AND SO YOU PROVED HIM RIGHT
BY BEING INVISIBLE ON THAT TAPE.

39:34.070 --> 39:36.891
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE MOST AMAZING COUPLE.

39:36.940 --> 39:38.828
HE JUST REFUSED
TO SEE IT.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.229
HE JUST BROKE MY HEART

39:42.280 --> 39:44.202
OVER AND OVER
AND OVER AGAIN,

39:44.240 --> 39:45.207
SO I JUST BROKE HIS!
