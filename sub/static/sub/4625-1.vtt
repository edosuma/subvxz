<i>Lord, I want to be like Jesus</i>

00:36.953 --> 00:41.858
<i>In my heart, in my heart</i>

00:41.958 --> 00:46.988
<i>Lord, I want to be like Jesus</i>

00:47.088 --> 00:50.174
<i>In my heart</i>

00:50.633 --> 00:55.914
<i>In my heart,</i>

00:56.014 --> 01:01.435
<i>In my heart</i>

01:02.228 --> 01:07.232
<i>Lord, I want to be like Jesus</i>

01:12.197 --> 01:17.201
<i>Lord, I want to be more holy</i>

01:17.702 --> 01:22.691
<i>In my heart, in my heart</i>

01:22.791 --> 01:27.779
<i>Lord, I want to be more holy</i>

01:27.879 --> 01:31.507
<i>in my heart</i>

01:32.008 --> 01:37.012
<i>In my heart</i>

01:37.263 --> 01:41.892
<i>in my heart</i>

01:43.436 --> 01:48.440
<i>Lord, I want to be a Christian</i>

01:49.651 --> 01:54.655
<i>Mm, in my heart</i>

01:59.619 --> 02:03.705
Don't be scared, Randy, it's only love.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.574
Lord, forgive your servant his weakness.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.411
Purge me, Father, of my sins,

02:42.996 --> 02:47.291
and please,
please take these dreams away.

02:55.466 --> 03:01.138
<i>Last night I had a dream that you</i>

03:02.056 --> 03:07.477
<i>Were holding me so dear</i>

03:08.688 --> 03:14.943
<i>You took away my doubting heart</i>

03:15.278 --> 03:20.282
<i>You took away my fear</i>

03:22.285 --> 03:29.249
<i>I love you, boy, you're mine alone</i>

03:29.626 --> 03:34.630
<i>And I am yours to take</i>

03:36.090 --> 03:40.510
<i>I promise you one day</i>

03:41.471 --> 03:47.935
<i>That we will mend every mistake</i>

03:50.605 --> 03:53.842
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want."

03:53.942 --> 03:55.051
Mom?

03:55.151 --> 03:58.487
"I will fear no evil,
for You are with me."

04:01.908 --> 04:03.158
Mom.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.623
Were you up all night?

04:14.212 --> 04:16.630
- Did you eat yet?
- Did you pray yet?

04:24.514 --> 04:29.518
They used to put the pictures
on the milk cartons.

04:30.853 --> 04:35.175
Little lost ones,
stolen babies, stray lambs.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.552
They would have
their pictures right there

04:37.652 --> 04:39.861
on that milk carton.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.115
They would let the world know.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.910
When did they stop?

04:47.787 --> 04:49.788
Jesus listens, you know.

04:50.206 --> 04:53.776
And maybe sometime the mail
just pile up a little high,

04:53.876 --> 04:57.280
but he opens every prayer in the end.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.841
More letters you send,
the better your chances.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.344
I'll be back in one minute.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.960
Lord, me again.

05:11.060 --> 05:15.006
I am so selfish, so steep in my own sin

05:15.106 --> 05:18.134
I forgot to ask for the one thing
I wanted most.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.136
Lord, I know you would have never done

05:20.236 --> 05:21.846
anything to Chrissie.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.681
She's just a little girl.

05:23.781 --> 05:26.476
And, Lord, I know you have a plan,
and whatever it may be, I would never

05:26.576 --> 05:29.578
question that, I would
never dare question.

05:29.954 --> 05:32.273
But if you find the time
to get to this letter,

05:32.373 --> 05:34.484
then please, Lord, please consider

05:34.584 --> 05:36.168
sending my sister home now.

05:37.086 --> 05:39.671
It's been six years, Lord.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.757
Six years.

05:53.202 --> 05:55.979
More dirty sheets, Randy?
This is getting regular.

05:56.647 --> 05:59.050
Morning, Ms. Rousseau,
looking chipper today.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.010
I think that robe's my favorite.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.987
Ooh, you done with that?

06:06.115 --> 06:08.226
- Efrem.
- What?

06:08.326 --> 06:11.271
My dad's on the road this week,
I ain't had time to get to the store.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.194
What?

06:18.294 --> 06:20.989
<i>Hey little boy, now bring me some water</i>

06:21.089 --> 06:24.716
<i>I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm old.</i>

06:26.052 --> 06:28.788
<i>Hey little boy, now come to your father.</i>

06:28.888 --> 06:30.389
Randy.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.224
Randy!

06:34.102 --> 06:35.352
Hey!

06:36.604 --> 06:39.048
Okay, it's ignore Efrem
week again already?

06:39.148 --> 06:42.176
<i>And if you don't repay
the error of your ways</i>

06:42.276 --> 06:45.263
<i>Your ma and I will love you still</i>

06:45.363 --> 06:47.739
<i>Love you still</i>

06:49.033 --> 06:52.228
<i>Hey little boy, best watch your behavior</i>

06:52.328 --> 06:55.831
<i>And all the words that you speak</i>

07:06.092 --> 07:08.536
So, what's going on
with these sheets, man?

07:08.636 --> 07:11.205
Have you, please God,
resumed jerking off

07:11.305 --> 07:13.765
like a normal teenage sex fiend?

07:14.600 --> 07:15.668
Come on.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.628
It's not gay to talk about sex, Randy.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.522
Straight guys never talk
about anything else.

07:21.315 --> 07:24.594
So how long has it been
since you choked the chicken?

07:24.694 --> 07:26.012
Almost a year.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.737
Good God.

07:28.364 --> 07:29.432
It's been hard.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.392
Permanently hard, I should think.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.201
No wonder you so uptight.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.855
How the hell do you do it?

07:35.955 --> 07:37.273
I pray a lot.

07:37.373 --> 07:40.151
Ah, the power of prayer.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.652
Prayer works, Efrem.

07:41.752 --> 07:42.878
Okay.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.949
I've been getting these dreams.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.117
Aha!

07:48.217 --> 07:51.537
I mean, how do you control
what you dream?

07:51.637 --> 07:55.208
I wake up in, in, I'm soaked in...

07:55.308 --> 07:56.459
In?

07:56.559 --> 07:57.585
Say it.

07:57.685 --> 07:58.753
Sin.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.213
Someone say my name?

08:03.232 --> 08:05.218
Hey, Randy. Hey, loser.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.902
Hey, freak.

08:07.778 --> 08:09.305
Hey, Crystal, what are you doing here?

08:09.405 --> 08:11.682
I came to shoo you guys along
in case you forgot.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.309
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.644
I'm meeting with Mr. Brock
about the play.

08:14.744 --> 08:15.812
Is that today?

08:15.912 --> 08:19.315
Oh, my God, I can't believe you guys.
It's totally today in like 20 minutes.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.817
Want to hit this?

08:20.917 --> 08:23.236
I don't know why y'all do that.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.363
Y'all know Jesus is not pleased.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.906
Actually, we had a little convo

08:27.006 --> 08:29.158
and my Jesus is very pleased.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.576
Oh, really?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.828
You had a conversation with Jesus?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.621
Sure did.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.582
You ain't the only one with a main line.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.626
<i>Jesus is on the main line</i>

08:38.726 --> 08:41.212
<i>Tell Him what you want, baby</i>

08:41.312 --> 08:43.339
<i>Jesus is on the main line</i>

08:43.438 --> 08:45.925
<i>Tell Him what you want, hey</i>

08:46.025 --> 08:48.094
<i>Jesus is one the main line</i>

08:48.194 --> 08:50.263
<i>Tell Him what you want</i>

08:50.363 --> 08:54.157
<i>Just call him up
and tell him what you want</i>

08:55.952 --> 08:58.771
<i>Jesus is on the main line,
tell him what you want</i>

08:58.871 --> 08:59.897
Which sin?

08:59.997 --> 09:00.982
Huh?

09:01.082 --> 09:03.025
Which sin were you guys talking
about when I walked up?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.819
Hopefully one of my favorites.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.488
It's not a real sin, it's a Randy sin.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.657
He's having nocturnal emissions.

09:09.757 --> 09:10.783
Efrem.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.702
Wet dreams about what?

09:12.802 --> 09:14.537
That's a good question.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.221
Randy?

09:16.722 --> 09:18.139
Randy?

09:22.395 --> 09:25.146
Or should that be who?

09:30.152 --> 09:32.028
Hey there, beautiful.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.282
- Huh?
- Hey there, beautiful.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.690
Love, so high school.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.041
Hello, we are in high school.

09:45.793 --> 09:48.154
You may be in high school,
but some of us

09:48.254 --> 09:50.907
are looking at the stars.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.082
I say we do a musical.
I mean, we all sing.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.753
- Randy sings.
- I do harmonies.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.671
Efrem sort of raps
or whatever that is he does.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.881
I do harmonies.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.508
I dance and Todd plays the guitar.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.009
- I...
- Leslie does harmonies.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.093
Between us we...

10:11.193 --> 10:12.929
Almost make up one
whole talented person?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.764
Would you shut your mouth?

10:14.864 --> 10:16.516
Randy, what do you think we should do?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.768
You'll probably direct
and star in everything.

10:18.868 --> 10:22.313
Uh, maybe Jesus Christ Superstar.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.565
- Uh-uh, negative.
- It's a good show.

10:24.665 --> 10:26.526
It's just... it might be nice to take

10:26.626 --> 10:28.277
a break from Jesus for a while.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.947
Oh, my God, what kind of
preacher's daughter are you?

10:31.047 --> 10:33.491
Don't get me wrong,
I love Jesus, of course,

10:33.591 --> 10:36.619
but He's there in everything we do.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.038
He's not so vain He needs
constant name checks.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.250
Actually, I was thinking
maybe we could do Rent.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.253
- It's high school theater.
- Really?

10:45.353 --> 10:46.837
Mr. Brock is not going to be down with

10:46.937 --> 10:50.174
drag queens, hustlers,
drugs, and swear words.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.426
Then Mr. Brock can kiss my...

10:52.526 --> 10:53.943
Mr. Brock!

10:54.862 --> 10:57.223
Well, young people.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.560
I don't know whether
to applaud your initiative

11:00.660 --> 11:03.604
or be insulted by your determination to

11:03.704 --> 11:05.815
strike out without me.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.358
It's your fault.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.194
For inspiring us, sir.

11:10.294 --> 11:13.322
What are you thinking of doing
for your first production?

11:13.422 --> 11:15.116
A modern day musical.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.325
Indeed.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.785
Tells the tale of poor, young artists

11:17.885 --> 11:20.387
struggling to make it
in contemporary society.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.206
I see.

11:22.306 --> 11:25.543
And what is the title
of this inspiring opus?

11:25.643 --> 11:28.212
- It's actually...
- Jesus Christ Superstar.

11:28.312 --> 11:33.316
Oh, boy, it's a little rich
for our small town blood,

11:33.484 --> 11:34.802
don't you think?

11:34.902 --> 11:37.305
The good Lord singing rock n' roll,

11:37.405 --> 11:39.807
lifting his skirts and hoofing.

11:39.907 --> 11:42.617
Well, I did anticipate this problem,

11:42.993 --> 11:45.271
which is why I sharing
in your enthusiasm

11:45.371 --> 11:47.523
for the British theater, and making it

11:47.623 --> 11:50.834
a condition that your
maiden production be.

11:55.589 --> 11:58.159
Romeo and fucking Juliet.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.870
Romeo and goddamn motherfucking Juliet.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.622
That tired ass, cock sucking...

12:02.722 --> 12:04.957
Come on, Efrem. What did you expect?

12:05.057 --> 12:06.584
Vampire lesbians of Sodom?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.628
It's actually not bad,
it's kind of steamy.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.254
I love the movie.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.715
- Oh, my gosh, me too.
- It did kind of rock.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.717
Yeah, it also had a budget
of like a zillion dollars.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.052
So, we have Randy.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.595
What am I going to do?

12:17.695 --> 12:20.014
Be your genius self
and come up with stuff.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.016
Imagination has no price.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.559
Well what can we do
to make Romeo and Juliet

12:23.659 --> 12:25.519
fucked up enough to keep Effie happy?

12:25.619 --> 12:26.786
Effie?

12:27.705 --> 12:30.066
Black Romeo and white Juliet.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.068
The school administration
should be fine with that.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.569
Screw that, man.

12:33.669 --> 12:34.737
What would freak those fuckheads out?

12:34.837 --> 12:36.697
It's our last year, for Christ's sake.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.658
These teachers must be shafted.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.576
What about like a white trash version?

12:40.676 --> 12:42.203
Tale of two trailer parks.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.579
We ain't white, honey.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.081
Yeah, but we're actors,
we can play anything.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.458
How about a gay version?

12:47.558 --> 12:49.502
What's with you today, are you high?

12:49.602 --> 12:50.920
Oh, my God.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.047
Romeo and Julian.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.690
My girl, you totally rule.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.760
It's brilliant.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.804
Romeo and Julian,
I actually kind of dig that.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.362
Who knew?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.558
- Randy, you should play Romeo.
- What?

13:04.658 --> 13:05.768
Why not, dude?

13:05.868 --> 13:07.895
I'll be your Julian
if you'll be my Romeo.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.480
Everybody thinks I'm gay anyway

13:09.580 --> 13:11.691
for hanging out with y'all,
but I'm still the

13:11.791 --> 13:14.235
fastest boy in the football field,
so fuck 'em.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.861
Leslie, you'd be cool with that?

13:15.961 --> 13:17.279
Are you kidding?

13:17.379 --> 13:20.783
I think boys together are like
the hottest thing on Earth like ever.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.785
Damn, the preacher's kid's a freak.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.762
Oh, my God,
everybody's going to flip out.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.057
Efrem!

13:29.558 --> 13:30.876
Squares.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.211
You know this Shakespeare guy

13:32.311 --> 13:34.213
kind of really knew his stuff.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.524
So, Randy, do you mind me directing?

13:38.150 --> 13:39.317
Randy?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.155
You learned it already?

13:45.908 --> 13:47.242
Enough.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.744
Doesn't sound as good
as your keyboard, but...

13:50.871 --> 13:53.873
I think I just about got
all the chords down.

14:00.756 --> 14:05.286
<i>You suck but in the most distracting way</i>

14:05.386 --> 14:07.496
<i>You're beautiful</i>

14:07.596 --> 14:10.040
<i>And there ain't nothing more to say</i>

14:10.140 --> 14:13.002
<i>I get excited by the thought of you</i>

14:13.102 --> 14:15.337
<i>It brightens up my day</i>

14:15.437 --> 14:20.233
<i>So you suck in the most distracting way</i>

14:23.362 --> 14:25.848
<i>When we fight, I was not right</i>

14:25.948 --> 14:28.309
<i>I'm feeling like a clown</i>

14:28.409 --> 14:30.770
<i>I dig my heels and stand my ground</i>

14:30.870 --> 14:33.522
<i>'Til reason can be found</i>

14:33.622 --> 14:35.775
<i>But when I'm faced with possibly</i>

14:35.875 --> 14:39.168
<i>Not having you around</i>

14:39.795 --> 14:42.323
<i>I'll do my best to work it out</i>

14:42.423 --> 14:47.427
<i>I'll puff my chest,
I'll scream and shout</i>

14:50.097 --> 14:52.640
<i>You</i>

14:54.810 --> 14:56.185
<i>Suck</i>

14:57.313 --> 15:01.717
<i>But in the most distracting way,
you're beautiful</i>

15:01.817 --> 15:04.637
<i>I love you 'til my dying day</i>

15:04.737 --> 15:07.473
<i>I get excited by the thought of you</i>

15:07.573 --> 15:09.725
<i>it brightens up my day</i>

15:09.825 --> 15:14.104
<i>So you suck but
in the most distracting way</i>

15:14.204 --> 15:19.208
<i>I said you suck,
because you take my breath away</i>

15:29.053 --> 15:30.720
Randy.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.598
Randy.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.225
Randy.

15:47.729 --> 15:50.766
- See y'all Sunday.
- Catch you later, Romeo.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.101
Wherefore art thou!

15:52.201 --> 15:54.103
- Later, guys.
- Bye y'all.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.870
Fuck off.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.024
She was dead?

15:59.124 --> 16:01.026
I swear it looked so real.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.611
What does it mean, Crystal?

16:02.711 --> 16:05.906
Why do I keep having these,
I don't know what they are, visions?

16:06.006 --> 16:07.533
Or premonitions?

16:07.633 --> 16:09.076
What are you saying?

16:09.176 --> 16:11.078
She's saying you got the shining, dude.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.496
Maybe it has something to do with

16:12.596 --> 16:14.623
- you being, you know.
- Uh, oh.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.333
With me being what?

16:16.433 --> 16:17.877
You know.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.519
No really, what?

16:21.605 --> 16:23.299
Yeah right, not even.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.466
Randy.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.343
We're your friends, you can trust us.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.137
Crystal, I'm not gay.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.263
How do you know?

16:29.363 --> 16:30.890
What kind of question is that?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.057
You're still a virgin, right?

16:32.157 --> 16:33.142
So are you.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.518
Yeah, don't remind me.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.020
So how do you know you're not gay?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.105
Because when I masturbate,
I think about boys.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.315
Crystal!

16:39.415 --> 16:40.608
Just like you.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.151
Crystal, for gosh sakes.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.153
Randy, who do you think about?

16:44.253 --> 16:46.421
- That's none of your...
- I think we know.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.532
Oh, do we?

16:48.632 --> 16:50.174
Dude, I think everyone knows.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.327
Oh, do they?

16:51.427 --> 16:52.661
Yeah, I mean, you heard Todd.

16:52.761 --> 16:53.871
For gosh sakes.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.497
Everyone thinks we're all gay anyway.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.499
That's not about me, that's about you.

16:57.599 --> 16:58.933
Me?

16:59.435 --> 17:00.544
Okay, right.

17:00.644 --> 17:03.213
See, you and your smart mouth.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.424
Acting all bitchy.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.259
I'm not like you.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.510
I'm in the choir.

17:08.609 --> 17:10.012
Now, that's butch.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.763
Almost as butch
as you staring into Todd's

17:11.864 --> 17:14.223
eyes singing love duets
in front of the entire school.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.268
I was singing to both of them.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.895
Jerking off to the both of them?

17:17.994 --> 17:19.521
See, you're a bitch.

17:19.621 --> 17:20.814
What about you, Efrem?

17:20.914 --> 17:22.023
Are you gay?

17:22.124 --> 17:23.483
God, I hope so.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.944
What else am I going to do
with all these Lady Gaga CDs?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.195
But you're a skateboarder.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.489
I know, right?

17:28.589 --> 17:29.782
Isn't it fabulous?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.200
Efrem, it's a sin.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.743
And so's lying.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.135
Give in to yourself.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.082
- Randy.
- Don't touch me.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.583
Dude, it's okay, she's a girl.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.168
Both of you can go to hell.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.378
Okay, see you there!

17:42.478 --> 17:43.644
Efrem.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.985
What do you want?

17:52.821 --> 17:54.098
To see you.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.933
You can see me at home.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.393
Well, I think your mom may have

17:57.493 --> 17:58.894
something to say about that.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.480
Mom doesn't have much to say
since you lit out on her.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.440
She didn't have too much
to say before I left neither.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.276
Well sorry if losing her only daughter
took some of her attention off of you.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.779
Randy, come on man,
we went over all this.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.239
So, what are you doing here?

18:10.339 --> 18:12.616
Why aren't you somewhere out there
looking for your daughter?

18:12.716 --> 18:14.258
You don't think I've looked?

18:15.427 --> 18:17.079
You don't think I'm still looking?

18:17.179 --> 18:19.680
I'm here because I have
more than one child.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.501
I came here to see how you're doing.

18:22.601 --> 18:25.170
Well, here's how I'm doing,
how all teenagers

18:25.270 --> 18:27.131
with deadbeat dads are doing.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.632
Satisfied, Pops?

18:28.732 --> 18:30.676
Who the hell you think
you're talking to?

18:30.776 --> 18:33.095
I don't know, it's been a while.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.180
Who the fuck are you?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.932
What did you just say "fuck" to me?

18:37.032 --> 18:39.826
Randy! What did you just say...

18:41.120 --> 18:42.438
Oh, my God.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.996
Fuck?

18:49.253 --> 18:52.197
"And call no man your father on Earth,

18:52.297 --> 18:56.175
for you have one father
who is in heaven."

19:11.400 --> 19:12.567
Mom?

19:24.788 --> 19:25.997
Mom?

19:36.091 --> 19:38.593
Mom, you are so corny sometimes.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.008
Hey, Justine.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.650
Randy, you need to come down
to the market.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.323
Hey Randy,
she's in the back by frozen foods.

20:05.787 --> 20:09.024
Just something for you to remember
to never forget, okay?

20:09.124 --> 20:10.833
Thank you, baby, here.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.488
Here you go, sis, okay?

20:14.588 --> 20:15.697
Look closely, ma'am.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.741
You could have saw her
this very morning, okay?

20:17.841 --> 20:19.785
You never know, you never know.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.287
Okay, I just need you to look,
just try to do your best.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.915
Here you go, sister, here you go.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.084
Think real hard, okay, 'cause she's a

20:27.184 --> 20:29.503
beautiful little girl,
beautiful little girl.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.213
Will you hear me, my baby's strong.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.673
Here's one for you.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.717
Hey, hey, this here,
this here's her brother, you know?

20:35.817 --> 20:37.761
She looked just like him.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.321
Yeah, she worships him.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.307
Always did.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.809
I'm ready to go home now.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.895
Okay, come on, come on,
let's go home little one.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.022
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.233
Thank you so much, here, don't forget.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.335
Don't forget, don't let them forget,
never forget.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.509
It's okay, it's okay.

21:04.304 --> 21:06.248
You hold onto mama's hand, okay?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.015
Good and tight.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.587
And don't you be sad, little baby boy.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.422
Mama's got you.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.981
You're safe.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.319
Would you like for me
to sing you a song, baby?

21:21.405 --> 21:26.393
<i>Jesus loves me, this I know</i>

21:26.493 --> 21:31.455
<i>For the Bible tells me so</i>

21:32.374 --> 21:37.378
<i>Little ones to him belong</i>

21:37.546 --> 21:42.550
<i>They are weak, but he is strong</i>

21:42.759 --> 21:47.763
<i>Yes, Jesus loves me</i>

21:48.473 --> 21:53.477
<i>Yes, Jesus loves me</i>

21:54.229 --> 21:58.717
<i>Yes, Jesus loves me</i>

21:58.817 --> 22:03.738
<i>For the Bible tells me so</i>

22:09.286 --> 22:10.828
Ooh, home.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.149
Well baby, you go ahead
and get washed up

22:14.249 --> 22:16.026
and I'm going to fix you
something special, you hear me?

22:16.126 --> 22:18.169
- Yes ma'am.
- Okay.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.164
Oh, gosh, she's here, Randy!

22:29.264 --> 22:31.583
Oh, God, Randy, Randy, Randy!

22:31.683 --> 22:33.309
In here!

22:35.103 --> 22:37.756
Randy, Randy baby,
she was here, she was here.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.007
She was here.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.801
She read the note,
she ate a piece of pie.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.177
She was here and I wasn't here for it.

22:42.277 --> 22:43.637
I missed her.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.347
She might be still here,
she might be still here hiding.

22:45.447 --> 22:48.016
Chrissie, Chrissie, Chrissie baby!

22:48.116 --> 22:49.184
Chrissie, it's okay!

22:49.284 --> 22:50.435
She's not here.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.603
How do you know?

22:51.703 --> 22:52.980
You are not even looking, Randy.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.856
Help Chrissie, mommy's here!

22:54.956 --> 22:56.749
I ate the pie.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.278
I ate the pie.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.795
I thought it was for me.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.201
Go to your room, Randy.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.010
Go to your room!

23:50.720 --> 23:51.929
Mom?

24:22.210 --> 24:23.878
Mom?

24:33.805 --> 24:35.415
- Todd?
- Hey.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.625
Hey.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.126
Sorry, are you in the middle
of something?

24:38.226 --> 24:39.503
I can come back.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.171
Oh, no, that's cool.

24:41.271 --> 24:42.646
Cool.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.639
Shit.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.432
Now I'm here I feel stupid.

24:52.532 --> 24:54.476
It's okay, Todd. What's going on?

24:54.576 --> 24:56.186
It's just you're the only one I can

24:56.286 --> 24:58.037
come to with this, you know?

24:58.997 --> 25:00.273
With what?

25:00.373 --> 25:03.985
Well, I read that the average age

25:04.085 --> 25:07.989
to lose your virginity is 17.5 for boys

25:08.089 --> 25:12.327
and 17.2 for girls,
and I'm 17.5 and Leslie's 17.2

25:12.427 --> 25:14.579
and we're both totally ready, you know?

25:14.679 --> 25:16.123
And we just don't want it to be like

25:16.223 --> 25:18.375
in the back of a car or something, so,

25:18.475 --> 25:22.712
we were wondering if maybe Sunday after
church service while you and your mom

25:22.812 --> 25:27.483
are at Bible group we could
maybe use your bed.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.485
Oh.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.446
You mad at me?

25:33.240 --> 25:34.224
No.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.116
For real?

25:37.869 --> 25:38.937
Cool.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.689
Thanks, man.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.858
You're a really,
really good friend, you know that?

25:42.958 --> 25:44.693
I didn't say yes.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.627
But you didn't say no either.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.927
Thanks, Randy.

26:14.698 --> 26:19.285
<i>One soul saved, one soul saved</i>

26:23.498 --> 26:27.569
<i>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound</i>

26:27.669 --> 26:31.880
<i>That saved a wretch like me</i>

26:32.382 --> 26:36.745
<i>I once was lost, but now I'm found</i>

26:36.845 --> 26:39.831
<i>Was blind but now I see</i>

26:39.931 --> 26:43.183
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

26:43.310 --> 26:46.228
<i>One soul saved, yeah</i>

26:48.231 --> 26:52.052
<i>One soul saved, one soul saved</i>

26:52.152 --> 26:57.098
<i>One soul saved, all the angels rejoice</i>

26:57.198 --> 26:59.726
<i>When there's one soul saved</i>

26:59.826 --> 27:04.747
<i>Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah</i>

27:08.209 --> 27:12.880
<i>Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah</i>

27:15.050 --> 27:19.412
<i>Oh, hallelujah, Lord, hallelujah</i>

27:19.512 --> 27:23.641
<i>Oh, Lord, hallelujah, yeah</i>

27:24.309 --> 27:29.313
<i>When there's one soul saved, yeah</i>

27:33.735 --> 27:35.345
Since Leslie's not feeling well today,

27:35.445 --> 27:36.987
Randy would you start us off?

27:37.530 --> 27:40.141
"But he said unto him,
if the case of a man

27:40.241 --> 27:44.203
be so with his wife,
then it is not good to marry."

27:50.168 --> 27:51.778
Randolph?

27:51.878 --> 27:53.879
Randolph?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.701
"But he said unto them, all men cannot

27:57.801 --> 27:59.369
receive the same.

27:59.469 --> 28:01.663
Save they to whom it is given."

28:01.763 --> 28:03.889
Praise God.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.893
It's just me.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.494
I just came around to say thank you.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.247
And I owe you one.

29:12.083 --> 29:16.003
I'm sorry, Todd, but I'm really not gay.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.657
It's okay, dude.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.466
Neither am I.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.043
Finally.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.380
Check it out.

30:08.181 --> 30:09.833
"No temptation has seized you

30:09.933 --> 30:12.252
except what is common to man.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.920
And God is faithful.

30:14.020 --> 30:17.173
He would not let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear.

30:17.273 --> 30:20.468
But when you are tempted, He will also

30:20.568 --> 30:24.363
provide a way out so
that you can stand up under it."

30:45.009 --> 30:46.260
Hey.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.513
Hey.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.166
Where you headed?

30:51.266 --> 30:52.975
None of your business.

30:53.434 --> 30:56.061
Want me to help speed up
that business and give you a lift?

31:05.780 --> 31:07.322
It wasn't that hard.

31:10.326 --> 31:11.686
How's your mama?

31:11.786 --> 31:14.538
She's, you know.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.869
She got a doctor's appointment
coming up.

31:27.969 --> 31:29.803
You should take her.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.014
I'd love to if she'd let me.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.435
She still sing to you?

31:37.312 --> 31:41.315
Sometimes, not often anymore.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.762
Well, sometimes you got to swim down

31:45.862 --> 31:47.529
from the surface to keep from drowning.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.561
Sometimes you gotta get away so you

31:53.661 --> 31:55.245
can come back stronger.

31:57.540 --> 31:58.790
So you can survive.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.877
Um, you can let me off up here.

32:03.338 --> 32:07.591
<i>'Cause I know who I am</i>

32:07.884 --> 32:12.888
<i>And you know who you are</i>

32:15.183 --> 32:19.978
<i>'Cause all it takes, love,
is a little bit more love</i>

32:20.188 --> 32:24.816
<i>And what we dream of isn't just made up</i>

32:25.109 --> 32:29.821
<i>And we'll break free from the land
of impossibilities</i>

32:43.294 --> 32:44.487
You lost?

32:44.587 --> 32:46.656
Um, no.

32:46.756 --> 32:50.133
Well, I'm looking for the...

32:50.718 --> 32:52.954
Yeah, a little lost.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.972
Maybe I can steer you
in the right direction.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.210
I'm here to audition
for the student film project.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.588
Would you happen to know where the

33:01.688 --> 33:03.798
performing arts building might be?

33:03.898 --> 33:05.440
Well guess where I'm heading?

33:24.419 --> 33:26.988
You stay away from me
or I'll scream, I mean it.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.506
This place is deserted.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.659
Scream all you want.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.620
No, please, stop.

33:33.720 --> 33:37.165
Please stop, stop, please stop.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.917
Please stop.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.809
Relax.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.046
It'll be over before you know it.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.548
Stop, somebody help!

33:45.648 --> 33:47.508
Help please, stop!

33:47.608 --> 33:49.026
And cut!

33:49.360 --> 33:52.362
You guys, that was great.

33:54.073 --> 33:55.808
You okay?

33:55.908 --> 33:57.852
I didn't hurt you, did I?

33:57.952 --> 34:01.022
No, just a little breathless.

34:01.122 --> 34:02.523
Oh, you're breathless?

34:02.623 --> 34:04.651
I am blown away.

34:04.751 --> 34:06.736
Randy, needless to say,
if you want this part,

34:06.836 --> 34:08.196
you more than got it.

34:08.295 --> 34:09.656
Please say you want it.

34:09.755 --> 34:11.658
Of course he wants it, Libby.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.534
You want it, don't you Randy?

34:13.634 --> 34:17.205
Okay, Marshall,
let's not scare our star away.

34:17.304 --> 34:20.556
Randy, do you need a little time
to think this over?

34:21.768 --> 34:23.601
Can I have a word with you?

34:24.103 --> 34:25.312
Sure.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.983
What's on your mind, Randy?

34:31.735 --> 34:34.054
The script seems really good,

34:34.155 --> 34:36.139
and you all seem really nice.

34:36.239 --> 34:37.850
But?

34:37.949 --> 34:40.952
But I'm not gay.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.856
You're not gay.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.525
Marshall's not a rapist.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.319
You're actors, Randy.

34:48.418 --> 34:50.530
Fabulous actors.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.281
And you two were made for each other.

34:52.380 --> 34:53.824
Just say yes.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.409
Say yes.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.912
Say yes, Libby, I will be your star.

34:59.263 --> 35:00.263
Yes.

35:00.389 --> 35:02.333
Yes, yes, Randy!

35:02.433 --> 35:05.169
Here are the directions
and a form for your mama

35:05.269 --> 35:07.630
to sign so she knows
you're gonna get raped.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.383
But it's all in the name of art, okay?

35:10.483 --> 35:12.719
Okay, yes, Randy.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.929
Oh, Marshall, I was thinking.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.278
What about...

35:26.165 --> 35:28.026
Need a lift?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.861
Uh no, I'm cool.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.571
The bus should be here any minute.

35:31.671 --> 35:33.421
I promise not to molest you again.

35:34.382 --> 35:37.160
It's gonna rain.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.553
In that case,
shouldn't you let your roof up?

35:50.940 --> 35:51.966
I wasn't nervous.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.525
Just freaked out?

35:53.943 --> 35:55.928
But the further away
from you the role is,

35:56.028 --> 35:57.889
the greater the challenge, right?

35:57.989 --> 36:00.266
Like you don't mind playing
a gay rapist.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.060
And you're not a gay rapist.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.228
Well, not a rapist.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.412
Huh?

36:05.746 --> 36:07.148
Oh.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.498
Yep.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.167
Oh.

36:11.002 --> 36:14.212
Can you work with an actor
who isn't totally acting?

36:16.090 --> 36:17.424
Sure.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.870
We do have a love scene.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.637
We're going to be getting
up close and personal.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.625
Can you handle the idea that

36:25.725 --> 36:28.226
I might be involuntarily responsive?

36:31.022 --> 36:32.606
Okay.

36:33.065 --> 36:34.675
You know what, just tell me to shut up.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.135
Okay, shut up.

36:36.235 --> 36:38.346
But first, let me assure you
that I am a professional

36:38.446 --> 36:40.598
and while we are rehearsing and shooting

36:40.698 --> 36:42.850
you're totally safe with me.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.160
You might as well be a girl.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.815
Now tell me to shut up.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.624
Shut up.

36:51.459 --> 36:55.128
You younguns, No respect.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.080
Cool tree, I like the ribbons.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.457
We're waiting for someone.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.641
I hear that.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.045
Thanks for the ride.

37:11.145 --> 37:13.047
Do you say that to all the guys?

37:18.152 --> 37:20.054
Just say that wherever Randolph may be

37:20.154 --> 37:23.615
right now that you send
Randolph home safe.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.439
Hi, mom.

37:30.539 --> 37:33.333
Hey, Pastor Crandall.

37:35.169 --> 37:36.586
It's ten o'clock.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.909
You could have called, Randolph.

37:42.009 --> 37:44.245
I'm sorry, I rode into evening class

37:44.345 --> 37:46.080
and just got a talking with the tutor.

37:46.180 --> 37:49.458
Well, you do understand how your mother
feels considering the circumstances.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.226
I'm sorry.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.562
Well, I'll leave you two in peace.

37:55.189 --> 37:56.841
Thank you so much, pastor.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.050
Any time.

37:58.150 --> 38:00.136
- God bless you.
- God bless you.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.904
And I'll see you
in choir rehearsal, Randolph.

38:04.740 --> 38:08.034
Pastor Crandall, thank you.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.245
Come here.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.716
I really am sorry, mom.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.052
Are you tired?

38:27.346 --> 38:28.888
What?

38:30.725 --> 38:32.517
Are you getting bored with God?

38:34.562 --> 38:36.005
Mom, please.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.522
It's okay.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.942
I understand.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.947
I've dreamed of releasing myself.

38:47.575 --> 38:52.579
And I find myself wishing...

38:54.123 --> 38:57.625
they would just tell me that she dead...

38:58.794 --> 39:01.463
and bring me my baby's body

39:02.089 --> 39:03.631
so I can kill myself.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.384
But I can't give up.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.888
I can't let go.

39:11.098 --> 39:12.959
Mom, please don't cry.

39:13.059 --> 39:16.462
I'll never stop crying, Randy.

39:16.562 --> 39:18.605
I never stop praying,

39:19.440 --> 39:23.344
waiting 'til they find my baby

39:23.444 --> 39:26.071
or at least find out
why we being punished.

39:28.115 --> 39:33.119
So if you stay here
or fly away like your daddy,

39:33.496 --> 39:35.705
I'll still be right here waiting.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.126
I may not be a wife anymore,

39:41.962 --> 39:44.672
I may not even be a woman anymore,

39:47.676 --> 39:53.515
but I'll never stop being a mother.

39:55.601 --> 40:00.605
I will never stop being a mother.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.362
I love you, mom.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.241
Go to bed, Randy.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.077
Just go to bed.

40:20.709 --> 40:22.252
Go to bed.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.572
Marshall?

40:53.200 --> 40:54.617
I'm worried about you.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.120
I just wanted to check you out.

40:57.913 --> 40:59.565
I'm fine.

40:59.665 --> 41:01.583
You're fine, all right.

41:03.377 --> 41:04.987
So fine.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.423
Hey y'all.

41:09.091 --> 41:12.385
Is this a gay party or can
a dirty straight boy join in?

41:16.056 --> 41:18.224
Relax, Randy.

41:18.893 --> 41:22.395
If it feels this good,
it couldn't be a sin.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.313
"Watch and pray that you may not

41:39.413 --> 41:41.607
enter into temptation.

41:41.707 --> 41:46.612
The spirit indeed is willing,
but the flesh is weak."

41:46.712 --> 41:50.074
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

41:50.174 --> 41:53.994
Have not saints lips
and holy palmers too?

41:54.094 --> 41:57.206
Ay, pilgrim, lips that
they must use in prayer.

41:57.306 --> 42:01.601
O then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

42:03.270 --> 42:07.466
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

42:07.566 --> 42:11.361
Then move not while
my prayer's effect I take.

42:12.029 --> 42:16.366
Thus far from my lips, by yours,
my sin is purged.

42:17.952 --> 42:22.148
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.

42:22.248 --> 42:27.252
Sin from thy lips?
O trespass sweetly urged.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.337
Give me my sin again.

42:36.845 --> 42:38.664
Bravo, bravo!

42:38.764 --> 42:40.223
You kiss by the book.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.714
What kind of girl likes
seeing her boyfriend

42:46.814 --> 42:48.424
get it on with other dudes?

42:48.524 --> 42:50.900
- Me.
- You don't count, freak.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.429
I want to run an idea past you.

42:53.529 --> 42:54.889
I think we should sleep together.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.849
- Sleep together?
- Have sex.

42:56.949 --> 42:58.017
Fuck.

42:58.117 --> 42:59.935
My virginity, your confusion.

43:00.035 --> 43:02.396
- Two bitches, one stone.
- One stop shopping.

43:02.496 --> 43:05.218
Crystal, we can't sleep together,
we're friends.

43:05.318 --> 43:06.817
And friends help each other out.

43:06.917 --> 43:09.502
My virginity is nothing but a curse.

43:10.129 --> 43:12.281
But don't you want to save it
for someone special?

43:12.381 --> 43:14.700
- Men are never special.
- Thanks.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.176
You don't count,
you're not a man, you're a Randy.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.079
Why'd I want to save
my precious virginity

43:19.179 --> 43:21.332
for some drunken frat boy to brag about?

43:21.432 --> 43:24.585
Not even, I'd rather give it to someone
who would at least find it useful.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.045
Crystal, I can't sleep with you.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.129
Why not?

43:27.229 --> 43:29.715
- Because he's so not gay.
- Because you're Crystal.

43:29.815 --> 43:32.092
And hot, thank you.
I thought you were straight.

43:32.192 --> 43:34.303
You're the only boy in school
who doesn't want to fuck me.

43:34.403 --> 43:35.763
Dude, even I want to fuck her.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.681
See, gayer than a school gay boy.

43:37.781 --> 43:39.725
I'm not about to have sex with anybody.

43:39.825 --> 43:41.519
I don't need to prove
anything to anyone.

43:41.619 --> 43:42.728
Got it?

43:42.828 --> 43:44.230
Subject closed.

43:44.330 --> 43:45.580
Closed!

43:46.707 --> 43:48.374
- Gay.
- I heard that.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.428
- What the heck are you doing?
- Shooting

44:00.554 --> 44:01.763
You're nuts.

44:02.681 --> 44:04.182
- Do something.
- What?

44:04.642 --> 44:06.309
Do something crazy for the camera.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.269
Be spontaneous.

44:09.021 --> 44:10.438
Be nuts.

44:10.898 --> 44:12.174
Say hey.

44:12.274 --> 44:13.524
What are you talking about?

44:14.234 --> 44:16.387
I love that you said heck.

44:16.487 --> 44:18.154
Love that you never curse.

44:18.906 --> 44:21.991
Love that you're so ripe and crisp.

44:23.077 --> 44:24.770
You love a lot, don't you?

44:24.870 --> 44:26.230
Dude.

44:26.330 --> 44:28.956
You have no idea.

44:45.432 --> 44:49.378
Uh, it's not going to get any greener.

44:49.478 --> 44:50.937
Sorry.

44:55.818 --> 44:58.512
So, how long you wanted to be an actor?

44:58.612 --> 45:00.431
Since freshman year, when I started

45:00.531 --> 45:02.474
taking drama in course.

45:02.574 --> 45:04.351
What kind of movies do you want to make?

45:04.451 --> 45:07.036
Not movies, films.

45:07.830 --> 45:09.064
What's the difference?

45:09.164 --> 45:12.151
Movies are about dreams.

45:12.251 --> 45:13.652
Films are about truth.

45:13.752 --> 45:15.962
What's wrong with the occasional dream?

45:16.922 --> 45:19.132
I don't know, maybe nothing.

45:20.300 --> 45:22.411
So, who's your favorite director?

45:22.511 --> 45:24.413
John Cassavetes.

45:24.513 --> 45:25.706
Who?

45:25.806 --> 45:28.349
The father of American
independent cinema.

45:29.810 --> 45:31.962
He used his success as an actor to make

45:32.062 --> 45:34.381
small personal films,
a lot of them with his wife,

45:34.481 --> 45:36.175
Gina Rowlands.

45:36.275 --> 45:40.054
They were like this fierce
pioneering Hollywood couple.

45:40.154 --> 45:42.572
Like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

45:43.157 --> 45:45.408
You are so cute.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.813
So how come you're not macking out

45:49.913 --> 45:52.373
in some big city film school?

45:54.126 --> 45:56.377
Not everybody can afford
the big city prices.

45:57.838 --> 45:59.130
What about your folks?

45:59.673 --> 46:01.090
What about them?

46:03.427 --> 46:04.886
You got a little time?

46:05.888 --> 46:07.346
I need to show you something, okay?

46:19.067 --> 46:20.568
Okay.

46:21.403 --> 46:22.779
What are we looking at?

46:24.072 --> 46:25.323
Where I'm from.

46:26.408 --> 46:27.700
Oh.

46:28.702 --> 46:29.952
Okay.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.664
Not all the white boys around here
come from money, you know?

46:34.166 --> 46:35.374
I guess.

46:35.876 --> 46:38.711
You just don't look or sound like...

46:39.338 --> 46:40.755
Trailer trash?

46:42.216 --> 46:43.508
You still live here?

46:44.176 --> 46:45.593
Still at home at 21.

46:46.178 --> 46:47.496
You're 21?

46:47.596 --> 46:49.623
You say in a way that kind
of makes me feel old.

46:49.723 --> 46:50.958
Go right ahead.

46:51.058 --> 46:53.976
No, I just mean you act so...

46:54.770 --> 46:56.103
You look so young.

46:56.563 --> 46:59.133
I didn't mean anything by it, God bless.

46:59.233 --> 47:00.775
God bless?

47:02.069 --> 47:04.179
I bet you're in the choir, aren't you?

47:04.279 --> 47:05.738
Yeah.

47:08.951 --> 47:10.743
I'm so going to hell.

47:11.578 --> 47:12.787
Why?

47:15.207 --> 47:18.584
'Cause I have the hots
for an underage choir boy.

47:20.170 --> 47:21.462
Maybe this is hell.

47:22.422 --> 47:24.966
I turn 18 this summer.

47:25.717 --> 47:27.134
But you're straight.

47:27.761 --> 47:29.387
Right.

47:31.390 --> 47:33.709
God, I so want to kiss you right now.

47:33.809 --> 47:35.476
Right outside your house?

47:37.855 --> 47:40.966
You're right,
it'd be even more fun inside.

47:41.066 --> 47:42.509
Yeah, right.

47:42.609 --> 47:44.344
Your parents would love that.

47:44.444 --> 47:45.763
They're cool.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.306
Rather that I was doing it
in the safety of my room

47:47.406 --> 47:49.516
than get busted by a cop up on the hill.

47:49.616 --> 47:51.117
The hill?

47:51.994 --> 47:54.245
Don't they teach you
straight boys nothing?

47:59.710 --> 48:01.419
What is this place?

48:02.588 --> 48:04.005
Who are all these guys?

48:06.884 --> 48:08.301
Welcome to Booty Hill.

48:08.635 --> 48:11.163
Is this some kind of lover's lane?

48:11.263 --> 48:12.471
Kinda.

48:12.723 --> 48:15.042
Most of these lovers will
pass each other on the street

48:15.142 --> 48:18.003
tomorrow without a word
like strangers in the light.

48:18.103 --> 48:19.213
Really?

48:19.313 --> 48:20.521
It's a small town.

48:22.482 --> 48:25.385
Most of these guys
are married or on the low.

48:25.485 --> 48:28.029
And this is where you hang out?

48:30.282 --> 48:33.367
Back when I was young and dumb and...

48:34.828 --> 48:37.747
small town lonely,
looking for a lover's lane.

48:43.879 --> 48:48.200
Got to admit, the stars up here
sure are something.

48:50.761 --> 48:52.094
Wow.

48:52.846 --> 48:54.096
Yeah.

48:55.265 --> 48:56.641
Wow.

48:58.685 --> 49:00.102
Get off me, man.

49:02.731 --> 49:06.776
Dude, what part of no
didn't you understand?

49:07.945 --> 49:09.195
Fucking tease.

49:29.508 --> 49:30.841
You all right?

49:32.552 --> 49:33.970
Let's get you home, all right?

49:42.437 --> 49:45.272
Guess you've gotten quite
an education tonight, huh, choir boy?

49:45.899 --> 49:47.274
I guess so.

49:47.985 --> 49:51.221
You probably don't even
go to church, do you?

49:51.321 --> 49:54.240
In this burg, we all do.

49:54.783 --> 49:56.617
It's a fucking town ordinance.

49:57.452 --> 50:00.496
Got to go to church, got to believe.

50:01.331 --> 50:03.582
Do you believe?

50:04.334 --> 50:06.820
Am I allowed to believe
and still be gay?

50:06.920 --> 50:08.280
It's kind of a sin.

50:08.380 --> 50:09.755
Is that what the preacher told you?

50:10.590 --> 50:12.258
Ever try asking God yourself?

50:13.844 --> 50:15.120
Have you?

50:15.220 --> 50:16.512
Yep.

50:16.972 --> 50:20.375
He said, "Marshall, you're all right."

50:20.475 --> 50:21.809
I said, "Are you sure?

50:22.352 --> 50:25.104
I have these weird feelings
when I sit in college with cute boys."

50:25.897 --> 50:29.593
God's like, "Who do you think
made cute boys?"

50:29.693 --> 50:32.319
I'm all, "You, right?"

50:34.156 --> 50:39.160
And He said, "To break
the hearts of boys like you."

50:41.788 --> 50:44.623
So you do believe in God?

50:46.251 --> 50:47.501
I do when I'm with you.

50:52.174 --> 50:53.200
Sing.

50:53.300 --> 50:54.284
What?

50:54.384 --> 50:56.385
Sing, Randy.

50:58.138 --> 50:59.555
Give me something to remember you by.

51:02.809 --> 51:04.586
So years from now
when you're fat and married

51:04.686 --> 51:07.480
with six screaming kids
that think daddy's God,

51:08.857 --> 51:10.342
and I'm up on Booty Hill
paying some desperate kid

51:10.442 --> 51:16.238
$20 for a bad blowjob,
that same song pop in my head.

51:16.782 --> 51:20.076
I'll remember the night we went
riding on a spring evening.

51:21.244 --> 51:23.522
A lonely gay guy and a straight boy with

51:23.622 --> 51:25.122
a voice that broke my heart.

51:33.757 --> 51:37.953
<i>Sweet hour of prayer</i>

51:38.053 --> 51:41.680
<i>Sweet hour of prayer</i>

51:42.766 --> 51:46.811
<i>The joy I feel</i>

51:47.312 --> 51:50.856
<i>The bliss I share</i>

51:51.858 --> 51:58.823
<i>Of those whose anxious spirits burn</i>

51:59.616 --> 52:03.369
<i>With strong desires</i>

52:03.703 --> 52:07.748
<i>For thy return</i>

52:09.042 --> 52:15.923
<i>With such I hasten to the place</i>

52:16.716 --> 52:21.621
<i>Where God my Savior</i>

52:21.721 --> 52:25.933
<i>Chose his fate</i>

52:26.309 --> 52:32.982
<i>And gladly take my station there</i>

52:35.652 --> 52:40.072
<i>And wait for thee</i>

52:40.282 --> 52:45.619
<i>Sweet hour of prayer</i>

52:52.919 --> 52:55.045
Wow. Like,

52:56.047 --> 52:59.633
officially, wow.

53:00.343 --> 53:01.594
Thanks.

53:06.725 --> 53:08.601
"Parting is such sweet sorrow.

53:12.022 --> 53:13.814
I shall say goodnight,

53:15.775 --> 53:17.151
'Til there be a morrow."

53:18.695 --> 53:23.350
"Sleep dwell upon thine eyes,
peace in thy breasts.

53:23.450 --> 53:29.163
Would I were peace and sleep,
so sweet to rest."

53:31.124 --> 53:32.708
Damn.

53:33.793 --> 53:35.169
Straight to hell.

53:49.351 --> 53:50.893
Crystal.

53:51.228 --> 53:54.521
My house, Sunday after church.

54:21.508 --> 54:23.008
Come on.

54:46.533 --> 54:48.575
What do we have here?

55:02.716 --> 55:03.950
Well?

55:04.050 --> 55:06.536
Well, we're not virgins anymore.

55:06.636 --> 55:08.455
Oh, my God, you skanks.

55:08.555 --> 55:12.292
Hey, Randy, how's it feel
to be a card carrying hetero?

55:13.977 --> 55:17.730
Randy, oh, Randy. Shh.

55:18.732 --> 55:20.008
Randy?

55:21.192 --> 55:24.695
Randy, shh.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.724
Honey, it's okay.

55:27.824 --> 55:29.491
Shh.

55:30.368 --> 55:31.827
It's okay.

55:32.412 --> 55:33.954
Come here.

55:34.748 --> 55:36.373
I got you, I got you.

55:46.509 --> 55:49.887
<i>They say when you're falling in love</i>

55:50.096 --> 55:53.265
<i>You feel like it's sent from above</i>

55:53.433 --> 55:56.393
<i>But no one can tell you just what</i>

55:56.728 --> 56:00.064
<i>You feel when you're falling in love</i>

56:00.315 --> 56:03.233
<i>I'm totally feeling confused</i>

56:03.401 --> 56:06.570
<i>But when I don't know what to do</i>

56:06.863 --> 56:08.947
<i>I pray to the heavens above</i>

56:09.115 --> 56:12.951
<i>I say, what is this feeling?</i>

56:13.244 --> 56:16.413
<i>Am I falling in love?</i>

56:16.623 --> 56:19.666
<i>It's got me reeling</i>

56:19.834 --> 56:22.878
<i>I just can't get enough</i>

56:23.129 --> 56:26.215
<i>Lord, I'm trying to resist it</i>

56:26.466 --> 56:29.301
<i>But it's so damn insistent</i>

56:30.095 --> 56:35.099
<i>What is this feeling? Oh</i>

56:37.811 --> 56:41.188
<i>Trying to embrace the word
like my mother did</i>

56:41.439 --> 56:44.024
<i>Or do I just kiss the wind
like my father did</i>

56:44.150 --> 56:46.485
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

56:46.653 --> 56:49.571
<i>Am I falling in love?</i>

56:49.823 --> 56:54.576
<i>Am I falling in love?</i>

56:55.328 --> 56:58.080
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

56:58.665 --> 57:01.500
And what satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

57:01.960 --> 57:06.964
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

57:07.465 --> 57:10.592
I gave thee mine
before thou didst request it:

57:11.386 --> 57:15.332
And yet I would it were to give again.

57:15.432 --> 57:17.099
Wouldst thou withdraw it?

57:17.475 --> 57:19.893
For what purpose, love?

57:20.353 --> 57:23.465
But to be frank, and give it thee again.

57:23.565 --> 57:26.358
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.

57:27.026 --> 57:30.028
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,

57:30.947 --> 57:33.767
My love as deep;
the more I give to thee,

57:33.867 --> 57:36.368
The more I have,

57:37.704 --> 57:40.622
for both are infinite

57:45.712 --> 57:47.379
Baby!

57:49.966 --> 57:52.092
Well I guess that beard started to itch.

57:53.636 --> 57:57.014
Oh, my God, Leslie's pregnant.

58:18.244 --> 58:19.536
Hey.

58:20.246 --> 58:21.914
I brought your school homework.

58:23.708 --> 58:26.752
My father is driving me
to Atlanta in the morning.

58:29.964 --> 58:31.131
Can you believe?

58:32.217 --> 58:35.161
There's not a single place in the entire

58:35.261 --> 58:38.639
state of Mississippi
where a woman can get a...

58:40.683 --> 58:41.975
procedure.

58:45.939 --> 58:47.022
There's a note.

58:49.734 --> 58:51.193
It's from Todd.

58:51.569 --> 58:54.889
Is there anything
you want me to tell him?

58:57.325 --> 58:58.784
What?

58:59.827 --> 59:04.790
As boundless as the sea,
my love as deep,

59:05.500 --> 59:10.504
the more I give, the more I have,
for both are infinite.

59:12.340 --> 59:13.700
Tell him?

59:13.800 --> 59:15.133
I promise.

59:15.677 --> 59:17.203
I promise.

59:17.303 --> 59:18.845
Every day.

59:30.650 --> 59:32.192
Did she say anything else?

59:33.486 --> 59:35.529
Did she say that she wants to do it?

59:36.781 --> 59:38.558
She wants the abortion?

59:38.658 --> 59:40.200
She didn't say she didn't.

59:41.786 --> 59:44.439
As boundless as the sea...

59:44.539 --> 59:48.917
All right, let's take it
from Friar Lawrence's exit.

59:51.879 --> 59:53.338
Action.

59:54.507 --> 59:55.841
What's here?

59:56.301 --> 59:59.469
A cup closed in my true love's hand?

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.933
Poison I see has been his timeless end.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:10.632
O churl! Drunk all,
and left no friendly drop

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:12.675
to help me after?

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.260
I will kiss thy lips.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.263
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:20.616
to make me die with the restorative.

01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:29.541
Oh, shit.

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:32.461
A word, young people.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.085
"Blessed is the man who remains

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:49.963
steadfast under trial,
for when he has stood

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:53.466
the tests, he will receive
the crown of life

01:00:53.566 --> 01:00:56.902
which God has promised
to those who love Him."

01:00:57.278 --> 01:00:58.805
Leslie!

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:00.656
Leslie?

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:02.642
Leslie, baby, we need to talk.

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.576
Todd, Todd, oh.

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:06.980
Where you going?

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.690
Get back in this house.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.751
I love you baby.

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:16.004
Get off my property!

01:01:16.964 --> 01:01:20.050
Sir, I need to speak with you, please.

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.662
What you need to do is get on your knees

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:24.706
and pray for you soul, boy.

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:26.332
Will you pray with me?

01:01:26.432 --> 01:01:29.059
Come on, please, please.

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:37.734
This is fucked up!

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.612
Fucked up bullshit!

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.784
Fucked up, fucked up,
fucked up bullshit!

01:01:48.287 --> 01:01:50.064
They hate me, man.

01:01:50.164 --> 01:01:52.108
Her dad hates me,
her whole family hates me

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:55.111
and soon enough the whole congregations
going to fucking hate me.

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:57.989
Todd, whether or not they like you,
you're the father of the baby.

01:01:58.089 --> 01:01:59.782
They're going to have
to talk to you eventually.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:02.035
Even if it only
is at the shotgun wedding.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.593
I've already proposed.

01:02:04.345 --> 01:02:07.264
Wrote her family a letter
and not a word.

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:10.585
God, I hate this fucking town.

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.477
Todd, Todd, wait up.

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.314
Wow.

01:02:16.649 --> 01:02:17.983
Heteros.

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:19.526
So fucking dramatic.

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:21.987
Efrem.

01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:25.099
Is everything okay?

01:02:25.199 --> 01:02:27.576
Yeah, peachy keen, why do you ask?

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:30.412
Is there anything you want to tell me?

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.624
Now that you mention it.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.656
Would you take a look at my penis
and tell me if it's okay?

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:40.948
Your what?

01:02:41.048 --> 01:02:42.909
Efrem, I'm sure it's fine.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.384
Would you just look?

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:47.846
What is that?

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:50.098
Help.

01:02:56.522 --> 01:03:01.485
<i>Fantasy, I think you lost your mind</i>

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:07.324
<i>Regardless of the outcome, so did I.</i>

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:12.120
So, how long you two been friends?

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:15.248
Only all our lives.

01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:17.151
I know that.

01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:18.695
I was there, remember?

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:22.255
I meant friends.

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:26.384
Dad, we're not friends.

01:03:27.261 --> 01:03:28.830
Randy's not gay.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.681
Oh, okay.

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:35.336
What do you mean "okay"?

01:03:35.436 --> 01:03:37.422
I mean if you were, I'm cool.

01:03:37.522 --> 01:03:39.632
Oh, Dad, please.

01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:41.233
Efrem Zimbliss Johnson?

01:03:42.276 --> 01:03:43.693
Bingo.

01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:46.112
Don't wait up, boys.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:51.618
Do we need to get you tested too?

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.647
God, Dad.

01:03:54.747 --> 01:03:57.332
I know, I know, I know, you're not gay.

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:02.254
But I know how it is,
kids experiment, you know.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:05.491
I mean, you ain't never kissed
or anything?

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:06.993
Dad, gross.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.427
Okay, well, I just gotta ask.

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.807
I kissed a boy once.

01:04:14.767 --> 01:04:16.002
What?

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.420
Yeah, tongues and everything.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.338
What are you talking about, when?

01:04:19.438 --> 01:04:22.274
Before you were born, man,
playing truth or dare.

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.484
Little Asian dude.

01:04:25.903 --> 01:04:27.153
Kind of cute, actually.

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:31.934
I thought this is going
to taste everything bad

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.660
about a man, you know?

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:35.954
Car oil, sweat, chewing tobacco.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.416
Thought it would be flat out strange.

01:04:39.917 --> 01:04:41.251
Matter of fact,
it wasn't strange at all.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:45.031
Kind of firmer than what I was used to,

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:47.215
but softer than I expected.

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:49.076
It was okay.

01:04:49.176 --> 01:04:51.120
I never felt the urge to do it again,

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.915
but then again, I had your mom
in my life, so I don't know.

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.057
Heck, imagine if mom knew.

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:58.518
She was the one that dared me.

01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:02.063
Yeah, she'll say she don't remember,

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:05.218
but I recall her face
like it was yesterday.

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:07.887
She was standing there
laughing and all shocked.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:09.529
She was into it.

01:05:10.948 --> 01:05:14.034
Boy, God, your momma, man.
That girl could laugh.

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:20.858
Mom watching you make out with a man?

01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:22.208
Yeah.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.502
Now I got the mental image.

01:05:26.839 --> 01:05:28.715
I know I'll never make out with a guy.

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:35.081
So, do we have a little Something,
something

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:37.875
going on with a girl at this time, what?

01:05:37.975 --> 01:05:39.085
Crystal?

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:41.587
- No.
- Well, you should.

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:45.633
Fine boy like you should have a whole
lot of something, something going on.

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:50.403
I know, you don't wanna
talk to me about this.

01:05:51.238 --> 01:05:54.183
I just want you to remember that God

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:57.869
made no mistakes making you,
even if I did.

01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:04.668
Never disrespect God by being
ashamed of His work.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.672
What are you saying, Dad?

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:15.095
I am saying that you got
a father you got, son,

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.263
and be your own man.

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:21.168
Ain't no preacher,
your mama, me, can say what

01:06:21.268 --> 01:06:24.646
it is to be a man,
that's between you and God.

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:27.857
How am I supposed
to know what God wants?

01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:30.303
I keep asking and asking
it's just like...

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:33.196
Well have you been listening
and listening?

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.365
Or you been doing all the talking?

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.581
By the way, thank you.

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.277
For what?

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:48.237
Dragging you halfway across the state

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:51.172
on behalf of my diseased friend?

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:54.884
For calling me Dad.

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:58.805
I really miss hearing that.

01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:09.967
Well, they gave me a jab in the ass,

01:07:10.067 --> 01:07:14.096
not nearly as fun as it sounds,
some antibiotics.

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:16.448
They gave you an HIV test, right?

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:20.076
All clear. Who knew?

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:24.273
Then you do know about safe sex, right?

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:27.151
Oh, yes, it's all my fault.

01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:28.569
Efrem.

01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:31.364
Hey, look here, I've known
your dad a long time, man,

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:32.881
you want me to talk to him?

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:38.219
He thinks I'm being gay
just to annoy him.

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:41.639
He's probably right.

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:47.588
Are you okay?

01:07:47.688 --> 01:07:50.383
I wish you would quit
fucking asking me that, man.

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.150
I'm running out of punchlines.

01:07:56.947 --> 01:07:58.782
Don't forget your seatbelt.

01:08:18.969 --> 01:08:21.470
Okay, let's get that boy home.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.432
Okay.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:33.899
<i>I spit in your drink
and expect you to think</i>

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:41.323
<i>Roads from here to hereafter
may be frozen</i>

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:48.540
<i>The burning sensation, the revelation</i>

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:53.654
<i>Don't be fooled, I've been here before</i>

01:08:53.754 --> 01:08:58.716
<i>I've done my part
and you're gonna miss your cue</i>

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:03.555
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:11.964
Welcome to the third annual
Forrest County,

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:15.301
Junior College, Student Film Festival,
where our aspiring

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:18.679
artists get to air their sick,
twisted visions of life

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:21.474
to their hopefully appreciative
and equally

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:22.975
sick and twisted peer group.

01:09:23.075 --> 01:09:24.310
That's y'all.

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:28.773
Now, allow me to sit down with you

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:31.024
and puke with jealousy,
as we watch our first

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:33.319
fledgling visionaries piece of shit.

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:36.488
Work of art together, whatever.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:38.282
Just roll the damn film.

01:09:49.225 --> 01:09:51.810
<i>When I first met you back in December</i>

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:58.818
<i>I think I thought I knew, I knew better</i>

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:06.784
<i>But now spring is around us</i>

01:10:08.829 --> 01:10:12.749
<i>Feels like a change is really happening</i>

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:18.296
<i>and everything is possible,
as you know by now</i>

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.218
<i>you have to surrender</i>

01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:31.267
<i>Someday young friend, maybe this time</i>

01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:34.687
<i>You could lose everything</i>

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:39.859
<i>And it will still be all right</i>

01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:50.536
<i>Don't turn your back on love</i>

01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:58.127
<i>Don't turn your back on love</i>

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:04.968
<i>'cause you can't turn back time</i>

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:09.665
Marshall MacNeil,
you get your ass up here.

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.408
What is this place?

01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:31.103
It's where people like me
come to be around

01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:36.207
other people like me,
where we can just be.

01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:38.293
Be what?

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.296
Ourselves.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.490
<i>Try not to wonder</i>

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.534
<i>Where you are</i>

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:50.638
<i>Running on empty since we've been apart</i>

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:57.963
<i>So I'm writing to reach you</i>

01:11:58.063 --> 01:12:03.026
<i>In the hope that my words
might melt your heart</i>

01:12:03.235 --> 01:12:04.694
May I have this dance?

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:14.647
<i>You love me and I love you</i>

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:19.109
<i>Please just tell me what to do</i>

01:12:19.209 --> 01:12:23.072
<i>I would give my life to prove that</i>

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:27.216
<i>I won't break your heart</i>

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:32.456
<i>Don't you know, can't you see</i>

01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:36.794
<i>This could be our destiny</i>

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:41.898
<i>'Cause together you and me,
we'd be unstoppable</i>

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.159
Can I ask you a question?

01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:56.204
Are you gay yet?

01:12:56.789 --> 01:13:01.000
Because tonight was awesome.

01:13:02.002 --> 01:13:04.379
But I'm going out
of my freaking mind here.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:06.839
So, are you?

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:09.467
Gay, I mean?

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:12.303
I know I'm not straight yet.

01:13:13.097 --> 01:13:14.555
That's a start.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:16.375
How?

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:17.934
I had sex.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.712
With a girl.

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.104
Sex?

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:24.565
Maybe she wasn't the right girl.

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:28.069
If there's a right girl, she's it.

01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:32.407
Were you this confused?

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.018
At your age?

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:35.493
Worse.

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:37.954
It was only a few years back.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.773
What changed things for you?

01:13:39.873 --> 01:13:41.249
The right guy.

01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:44.710
What did the right guy do?

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:47.046
What I'm going to do to you.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.177
What's that?

01:13:54.179 --> 01:13:55.513
You really want to know?

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.723
Yes.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:00.393
What I'm going to do is...

01:14:12.072 --> 01:14:13.322
I'm sorry.

01:14:14.199 --> 01:14:15.491
Sorry.

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:27.086
Kiss me. Kiss me.

01:14:31.758 --> 01:14:33.593
Oh, God, let me touch you.

01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:16.286
Get your ass out of that car.

01:15:16.386 --> 01:15:18.831
Mom! Mom, it's not what you think!

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:21.390
Shut up, what do you mean
it's not what I think?

01:15:21.558 --> 01:15:22.793
I should murder your nasty ass.

01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:25.045
You're going to the bottom of hell.

01:15:25.145 --> 01:15:27.673
Randy, when I get you,
I swear to God, you out here

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:30.342
doing that like that.
You still going to try to see him?

01:15:30.442 --> 01:15:32.678
Get in that house, get in that house.

01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:34.972
You will not be out here
with that sickness,

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:37.073
acting like no damn priest.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.955
So, now we know.

01:15:44.456 --> 01:15:46.984
Now we know why we're being punished.

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:49.736
Chrissie is the price
we pay for your sin,

01:15:49.836 --> 01:15:51.572
for your sin and your weakness.

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:53.115
Randy, how could you?

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.159
How could you be so selfish?

01:15:55.259 --> 01:15:56.910
And you know the Lord is watching us.

01:15:57.010 --> 01:15:58.704
You know we being tested.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:00.205
But so what, so what?

01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:01.957
You still indulge in your depravity.

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.459
I'm ashamed of you, Randy.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.752
Before God you have shamed us.

01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:08.213
I cannot believe you
crawl forth from my body

01:16:08.313 --> 01:16:10.549
into this Earth to fornicate frivolously

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:12.233
like a craven beast.

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:14.094
Am I to have no children.

01:16:14.194 --> 01:16:16.388
Is that my fate,
to lose the both of you?

01:16:16.488 --> 01:16:17.556
Mom, I'm sorry.

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:18.724
Don't you do that.

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:22.034
Don't you do that, don't you tell me
you sorry when you not.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:25.481
When you standing there
still stinking of him

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:28.984
and thinking of him,
wondering is he thinking of you.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:31.403
Trying to figure out when you're going

01:16:31.503 --> 01:16:33.405
to see him next, aren't you?

01:16:33.505 --> 01:16:34.907
Aren't you?

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:36.549
Yes.

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:41.762
You disgust me.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:47.184
But you will never,
never make me give up my family.

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:51.381
And you gonna stand there and cry

01:16:51.481 --> 01:16:53.065
like a fucking punk?

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:57.945
You are the reason
why they took my baby.

01:17:04.077 --> 01:17:06.146
God, please just tell me, just tell me.

01:17:06.246 --> 01:17:10.442
Just tell me, tell me
what you need me to do.

01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:13.195
Tell me what you need me to do, God,

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.781
because no, he can't even beat it.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:17.783
He can't beat it, he can't beat it.

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:20.035
God, he can't beat it.

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:22.538
Please, my baby, please.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:56.921
One second, Mom.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.665
Hello, Randolph.

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.500
Pastor Crandall.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.892
May I come in?

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.315
Interesting room.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.318
Very creative.

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:22.931
I like the colors.

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.182
Thanks.

01:18:24.282 --> 01:18:25.934
Mom and Dad gave me free reign to

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:28.160
decorate up here how I like.

01:18:29.329 --> 01:18:31.122
The blue reminds me of the sky.

01:18:31.998 --> 01:18:34.542
Sometimes when
I'm lying down looking up,

01:18:35.168 --> 01:18:36.961
it's like I can imagine
what it must really

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:38.295
feel like to fly.

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:40.464
Tell me.

01:18:43.927 --> 01:18:45.553
How long have you been struggling?

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:47.805
Struggling?

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.849
With these unnatural desires.

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:53.894
I don't know, sir.

01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:56.089
All my life.

01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:57.648
As long as I can remember.

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:01.652
I thought I could ignore it, bury it.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:06.240
But I get these dreams.

01:19:07.325 --> 01:19:08.743
Dreams.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:15.400
Do you want to be normal, Randolph?

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.543
Yes, yes I do.

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:22.506
Now, only the Lord can cast out
these unclean spirits, these demons.

01:19:23.675 --> 01:19:26.078
You think I'm possessed?

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:27.762
I believe there's something
lurking in you.

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:32.292
Are you talking about exorcism?

01:19:32.392 --> 01:19:34.643
He's talking about deliverance.

01:19:36.813 --> 01:19:39.466
Are you ready for deliverance, Randolph?

01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:42.052
Yes, yes I am.

01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:44.195
Please, save me.

01:19:58.335 --> 01:20:01.738
Lord Jesus, we pray for your power,

01:20:01.838 --> 01:20:04.574
for your great healing power.

01:20:04.674 --> 01:20:08.203
Lord God, we are prepared
to stay as long as it takes

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:10.914
to cleanse this young child.

01:20:11.014 --> 01:20:12.807
- Oh, please, Heavenly Father.
- Almighty God.

01:20:14.559 --> 01:20:18.463
Look down upon this
your child and heal him.

01:20:18.563 --> 01:20:19.923
Heal my Randy, Father

01:20:20.023 --> 01:20:22.134
Cleanse him, almighty God.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:25.429
Deliver him from the ungodly
sinful forces

01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:28.056
that have held him captive, that have

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:32.201
held him in bondage
against these unnatural desires.

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:33.729
Oh, please, Father.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:37.915
Deliver this, your poor sinful soul

01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:42.253
from the bondages of unclean spirits.

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:46.158
Deliver him,
this is your child, Father God.

01:20:46.258 --> 01:20:48.535
This poor sinful servant from the bonds

01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:51.470
of unnatural feelings.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:54.750
Look down upon this your child
and have mercy.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.294
Mercy Lord, mercy, please.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:20:59.129
Remove this sin.

01:20:59.229 --> 01:21:04.149
As boundless as the sea,
my love as deep.

01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:09.572
The more I give, the more I have,
for both are infinite.

01:21:14.828 --> 01:21:17.939
Save him, Lord, save him.

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:20.066
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

01:21:20.166 --> 01:21:21.318
Yes, God.

01:21:21.418 --> 01:21:23.210
Lord God.

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:27.840
Where's Leslie?

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:30.634
Where's Leslie?

01:21:42.607 --> 01:21:44.106
Oh, my God!

01:21:44.691 --> 01:21:47.526
Oh, my God, baby, no!

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:50.597
Oh, my God, what happened?

01:21:50.697 --> 01:21:53.073
Oh, my God.

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:13.995
"Trust in the Lord with all your heart

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:16.972
and lean not on your own understanding."

01:22:57.889 --> 01:23:02.851
<i>I dream these dreams
from the darkness in between</i>

01:23:03.895 --> 01:23:08.899
<i>But I hope that I am not the only one</i>

01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:12.486
Hi.

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:14.446
Is Marshall here?

01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:19.076
It's okay, Mom.

01:23:20.286 --> 01:23:22.079
This is the guy I was telling you about.

01:23:23.289 --> 01:23:24.957
This is Randy.

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:04.189
<i>Take my dark, take my light</i>

01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:07.525
<i>Take my freedom and my flight</i>

01:24:07.625 --> 01:24:10.278
<i>Take out all my reasons wrong</i>

01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:13.714
<i>And make them right</i>

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:16.868
<i>Take my night, take my day</i>

01:24:16.968 --> 01:24:20.288
<i>Take my cold and bitter ways</i>

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:25.392
<i>Take it all from me,
just promise that you'll stay</i>

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:32.566
<i>Oh,</i>

01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:55.672
I love you.

01:24:57.509 --> 01:24:58.884
Wait.

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.265
He says, "It's okay."

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.689
God's here?

01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:17.236
God's here.

01:25:34.254 --> 01:25:37.574
"Whoever does not love
does not know God,

01:25:37.674 --> 01:25:40.634
because God is love."

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:58.110
Mom?

01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:03.141
Mom?

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:04.684
It's okay, Randy.

01:26:04.784 --> 01:26:06.770
Everything is okay. They found her.

01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.021
She's coming home.

01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:09.746
She's coming home.

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:12.082
My baby's coming home.

01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:14.126
Chrissie?

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.140
Mom, Dad.

01:26:31.895 --> 01:26:34.104
This is Marshall.

01:26:36.232 --> 01:26:39.776
My... my boyfriend.

01:26:46.117 --> 01:26:47.451
Sir.

01:26:50.914 --> 01:26:52.539
Good to meet you, man.

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:54.374
Great to meet you.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:26:59.421
Ma'am.

01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:12.893
They're here.

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:54.810
Chrissie.

01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:57.312
Chrissie.

01:27:58.064 --> 01:27:59.523
Chrissie.

01:28:09.921 --> 01:28:12.202
Chrissie.

01:28:14.038 --> 01:28:15.789
All right, all right.

01:28:25.174 --> 01:28:26.883
Thank you, God.

01:28:32.056 --> 01:28:33.333
Turns out Chrissie had been living

01:28:33.433 --> 01:28:36.085
with a family in Arkansas
the whole time.

01:28:36.185 --> 01:28:38.296
Some woman who couldn't
have kids snatched her

01:28:38.396 --> 01:28:40.965
and was raising her as her own.

01:28:41.065 --> 01:28:42.967
Mom says since God brought Chrissie back

01:28:43.067 --> 01:28:46.804
home to us,
it wasn't my fault after all.

01:28:46.904 --> 01:28:49.614
"God is love," she said.

01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:51.825
"God is love."

01:29:09.552 --> 01:29:11.371
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:29:11.471 --> 01:29:13.206
What's up, dude?

01:29:13.306 --> 01:29:14.958
Todd, what's going on?

01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:16.960
Just came around to say goodbye.

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.461
Goodbye?

01:29:18.561 --> 01:29:20.713
And thank you for being
a good Christian brother to me.

01:29:20.813 --> 01:29:22.674
Todd, where are you going?

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:24.358
How's it going with Marshall?

01:29:26.110 --> 01:29:27.470
Marshall?

01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:29.681
Seems like a totally cool guy.

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:32.225
You've never met Marshall, Todd.

01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:35.952
Sometimes I'm kind of jealous of him.

01:29:36.579 --> 01:29:37.996
Jealous?

01:29:38.289 --> 01:29:40.525
Would have been kind of cool,
wouldn't it?

01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:42.568
I could have loved you the way he does.

01:29:42.668 --> 01:29:44.044
I know that's what you wanted.

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:49.800
I kind of wanted it too,
but it was Leslie.

01:29:51.969 --> 01:29:53.178
Leslie.

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:55.347
So beautiful.

01:29:56.766 --> 01:29:58.809
I'm so sorry, Todd.

01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:01.311
You don't have nothing
to be sorry for, dude.

01:30:01.854 --> 01:30:03.397
You must miss her so much.

01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:07.150
I used to. It was hard.

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:08.735
But it's okay now.

01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:10.737
I should go.

01:30:11.322 --> 01:30:12.781
Where you going?

01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.533
You know where, dude.

01:30:14.992 --> 01:30:16.451
I have to get back to Leslie.

01:30:17.161 --> 01:30:19.996
- She's waiting for me.
- Todd!

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:23.208
Shh, you'll wake yourself.

01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:26.086
That's Marshall.

01:30:26.379 --> 01:30:28.114
Dude, I know your parents like the guy,

01:30:28.214 --> 01:30:29.840
but he ain't sleeping over yet.

01:30:31.008 --> 01:30:32.592
I don't get this.

01:30:34.011 --> 01:30:35.971
It's only been a couple months
since they met him.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:38.624
I don't get this.

01:30:38.724 --> 01:30:40.225
What is this?

01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:44.297
You know what this is, dude.

01:30:44.397 --> 01:30:46.606
You don't want to know, but you know.

01:30:47.525 --> 01:30:50.402
This has been the same dream
you've had for the past two months.

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:54.197
Remember?

01:30:54.490 --> 01:30:57.242
I drove my bike under the train
the week after Leslie died.

01:30:58.202 --> 01:31:00.328
You sang at the funeral,
it was beautiful.

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:03.457
Your sister ran away twice.

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:06.084
But she's starting to settle down now.

01:31:06.878 --> 01:31:08.946
Your dad moved back home again,

01:31:09.046 --> 01:31:13.242
and it's not working out too well
right now, but it'll be okay eventually.

01:31:13.342 --> 01:31:14.634
They'll make it.

01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:17.429
You'll move to Los Angeles
with Marshall.

01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:20.166
You'll both fall in love
with other people.

01:31:20.266 --> 01:31:22.168
You'll remain lifelong friends
who everybody

01:31:22.268 --> 01:31:23.768
knows should be together.

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:28.049
Crystal will move to New York
and you'll lose touch.

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:32.053
Efrem will move to LA,
go through tattoos,

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:35.807
steroids, and a crystal meth addiction.

01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:39.201
And he'll admit on his deathbed
that he's always been in love with you.

01:31:41.746 --> 01:31:46.750
One day you'll write a movie
about all of this.

01:31:47.251 --> 01:31:49.445
Marshall will direct it and you'll watch

01:31:49.545 --> 01:31:52.297
your memories on screen and realize...

01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:58.345
"Wow, we were so young."

01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:01.223
And you'll be right.

01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:04.684
We were.

01:32:06.437 --> 01:32:09.507
You should get back to sleep now,
before you wake up.

01:32:09.607 --> 01:32:11.384
You've got a crazy big life ahead of you

01:32:11.484 --> 01:32:13.511
and you're going to need
all the rest you can get.

01:32:13.611 --> 01:32:15.263
It's okay.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:16.655
Marshall's still there.

01:32:17.156 --> 01:32:18.349
Hey.

01:32:18.449 --> 01:32:21.034
Want me to come lie down
with you a while?

01:32:21.744 --> 01:32:23.620
Just 'til you fall asleep?

01:32:25.122 --> 01:32:26.540
Would you?

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.251
This is your dream, dude.

01:32:31.837 --> 01:32:38.426
<i>But now my heart is on its way</i>

01:32:38.844 --> 01:32:45.392
<i>And so I feel that I should say</i>

01:32:45.977 --> 01:32:54.401
<i>That you could be my only fate</i>

01:33:00.157 --> 01:33:03.394
Randy, boy get your
black behind down here.

01:33:03.494 --> 01:33:05.370
You're going to miss breakfast.

01:33:21.053 --> 01:33:22.747
Just let him know I don't like him.

01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:23.873
You want another pancake?

01:33:23.973 --> 01:33:26.516
- Yes please.
- There you go.

01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:31.354
Ah, nice of you to join us,
sleeping beauty.

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:35.525
Is it too much to ask to have my family
at the table all at once?

01:33:36.402 --> 01:33:39.263
"Love is patient, love is kind,

01:33:39.363 --> 01:33:44.352
it does not envy, it does
not boast, it is not proud,

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:48.648
it is not self seeking,
it is not easily angered.

01:33:48.748 --> 01:33:50.790
It keeps no record of wrongs.

01:33:51.542 --> 01:33:55.363
Love does not delight in evil
but rejoices with the truth.

01:33:55.463 --> 01:34:00.425
It always protects,
always trusts, always hopes,

01:34:00.926 --> 01:34:03.454
always perseveres.

01:34:03.554 --> 01:34:06.541
Love bears all things,
believes all things,

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:10.127
hopes all things, endures all things.

01:34:10.227 --> 01:34:12.646
Love never ends."

01:34:19.028 --> 01:34:20.513
Tell that white boy to stop blowing

01:34:20.613 --> 01:34:22.348
that horn in front of my house.

01:34:22.448 --> 01:34:24.157
This ain't the projects.

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:29.522
Later, Mr. Rousseau.

01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:31.456
Bye, Dad.

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:33.917
Bye, Dad.

01:34:40.591 --> 01:34:42.133
Move, freak.

01:35:02.738 --> 01:35:10.912
<i>There is light at the end of this tunnel</i>

01:35:11.122 --> 01:35:19.212
<i>And the rain will cease to fall</i>

01:35:21.924 --> 01:35:30.682
<i>Moving right along might be
right or should be wrong</i>

01:35:31.142 --> 01:35:37.814
<i>And my soul will cease to fall</i>

01:35:41.193 --> 01:35:49.409
<i>There is light at the end of this tunnel</i>

01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:58.585
<i>And my soul will cease to fall</i>

01:36:05.342 --> 01:36:08.845
<i>It feels like a pleasant surprise</i>

01:36:09.138 --> 01:36:12.182
<i>Whenever I look in your eyes</i>

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:15.518
<i>I know what I want it to be</i>

01:36:15.686 --> 01:36:17.604
<i>Whenever you look at me</i>

01:36:17.813 --> 01:36:21.941
<i>I say there's something
so special in you</i>

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:25.236
<i>I feel like you're feeling it too</i>

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:28.740
<i>now I want to know what's in store</i>

01:36:28.866 --> 01:36:31.409
<i>I never knew love before you</i>

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:35.538
<i>Say you're totally crushing on me</i>

01:36:35.748 --> 01:36:38.082
<i>Well I got a crush on you too</i>

01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:42.378
<i>You know it's true my baby got me saying</i>

01:36:42.588 --> 01:36:45.465
<i>What is this feeling</i>

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:48.510
<i>Am I falling in love</i>

01:36:48.761 --> 01:36:51.805
<i>It's got me reeling</i>

01:36:52.014 --> 01:36:55.058
<i>I just can't get enough</i>

01:36:55.434 --> 01:36:58.603
<i>Lord, I'm trying to resist it</i>

01:36:58.729 --> 01:37:01.940
<i>But it's so damn insistent</i>

01:37:02.191 --> 01:37:06.945
<i>What is this feeling, Oh,</i>

01:37:11.408 --> 01:37:16.079
<i>Don't know anything about love</i>

01:37:16.372 --> 01:37:21.376
<i>But I'm trying to find out
what you're made of</i>

01:37:21.794 --> 01:37:26.798
<i>When you say that you love me</i>

01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:31.970
<i>What is this feeling</i>

01:37:32.137 --> 01:37:35.431
<i>Am I falling in love</i>

01:37:35.641 --> 01:37:38.753
<i>It's got me reeling</i>

01:37:38.853 --> 01:37:41.855
<i>I just can't get enough</i>

01:37:42.064 --> 01:37:45.384
<i>Lord I'm trying to resist it</i>

01:37:45.484 --> 01:37:48.778
<i>But it's so damn insistent</i>

01:37:48.904 --> 01:37:53.783
<i>What is this feeling, Oh,</i>

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:58.663
<i>What is this feeling</i>

01:37:58.789 --> 01:38:01.416
<i>Am I falling in love</i>

01:38:02.251 --> 01:38:06.045
<i>It's got me reeling, yeah</i>

01:38:06.171 --> 01:38:08.506
<i>I can't get enough</i>

01:38:08.674 --> 01:38:11.926
<i>Lord, I'm trying to resist it</i>

01:38:12.136 --> 01:38:15.638
<i>But it's so damn insistent</i>

01:38:15.848 --> 01:38:20.059
<i>What is this feeling</i>

01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:23.980
<i>What</i>

01:38:31.447 --> 01:38:34.532
<i>I don't know</i>

01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:38.661
<i>Which way to go</i>

01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:44.918
<i>I can't resist wanting your kiss</i>

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:50.757
<i>What is this feeling, Oh,</i>

01:38:56.972 --> 01:38:59.766
<i>I don't know</i>

01:39:00.225 --> 01:39:03.353
<i>I don't know</i>

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:06.689
<i>Trying to embrace the word
like my mother did</i>

01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:09.525
<i>Or do I just kiss the wind
like my father did</i>

01:39:09.693 --> 01:39:12.221
<i>What is this feeling</i>

01:39:12.321 --> 01:39:15.323
<i>Am I falling in love</i>

01:39:15.574 --> 01:39:20.578
<i>Am I falling in love</i>

01:39:21.305 --> 01:39:27.213
