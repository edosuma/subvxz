00:14.481 --> 00:16.715
this is straight
out of a slasher flick.

00:16.717 --> 00:20.119
Usually find murder victims at
the end of hallways like these.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.787
Cannot believe
alexis lives here.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.456
Richard, alexis and pi
have invited us for dinner.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.092
this is a big step
for them.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.094
So let us not be
judgmental.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.362
Fine.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.197
Besides...

00:32.198 --> 00:34.433
Remember the hovel you lived in
in college?

00:34.435 --> 00:36.435
Only difference is
I wasn't shacking up with pi.

00:38.039 --> 00:39.104
Well, it's nice that

00:39.106 --> 00:41.206
You're keeping an open mind,
dear.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.441
Mm.
Hi!

00:42.443 --> 00:44.576
Hi.
You're here!

00:44.578 --> 00:47.813
Come on in. I'm so excited
for you to see our place.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.148
Come on.

00:51.251 --> 00:56.188
Oh... My. Your first place.

00:56.190 --> 00:59.058
Oh.
hey! Mr. C.!

00:59.060 --> 01:01.126
Welcome. And prepare yourself

01:01.128 --> 01:03.262
For some savory
and sustainable dining.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.731
Ah, let me guess.
There will be fruit.

01:05.733 --> 01:09.234
I'll make a fruitarian
out of you yet, mr. C.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.569
Great.
Huh?

01:10.571 --> 01:13.238
Uh, here is a, um, little
housewarming present.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.207
ooh.
And it needs sunlight,

01:15.209 --> 01:17.509
And there's a little gift card
as well.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.610
Thank you, gram.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.079
Well?
What do you think?

01:20.081 --> 01:21.613
Oh, I think
it's adorable.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.083
I love what the two of you
have done with this.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.851
Yeah, we've had lots of fun
fixing it up.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.153
We were eating on a blanket
on the floor,

01:28.155 --> 01:30.155
But then we found this old door
and set it up as a table.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.825
And I found the chairs
next to a restaurant dumpster.

01:32.827 --> 01:35.694
Oh!
Dumpster chairs. That's...

01:35.696 --> 01:36.728
Great.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.464
Well, there is nothing like

01:38.466 --> 01:41.467
<i>La vie boheme
to get the blood flowing.</i>

01:41.469 --> 01:43.202
I'll take that.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.237
be nice.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.572
oh, look.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.173
A futon.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.411
oh, yes.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.613
You know, if you guys
want something real to sit on,

01:54.615 --> 01:57.249
I have an old couch in storage.
I could just...

01:57.251 --> 02:00.185
Hmm. Uh, I don't know,
mr. C. Um...

02:00.187 --> 02:01.653
What color is it?

02:01.655 --> 02:04.123
Free.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.191
Dad, we're fine.
We have everything we need.

02:06.193 --> 02:10.262
So, pi, alexis tells me
that you have a new job.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.563
I do indeed. I am tracking
bee populations in the city

02:11.565 --> 02:13.665
For an n.G.O.
Uh-huh.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.400
It's a lot like the job
I did in costa rica.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.636
We're assessing the colony's
strength and numbers.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.539
So you're...
Counting bees.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.175
Well, there's a little more
to it than that, mr. C.,

02:23.177 --> 02:24.276
But... Yeah.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.844
And that's a real job?

02:25.846 --> 02:27.880
Yes, it's a real job.

02:27.882 --> 02:29.815
Bees are vital
to the food supply.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.517
It's important work.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.218
Well...

02:33.220 --> 02:35.687
So long as it puts fruit
on the table.

02:35.689 --> 02:39.358
Speaking of the table,
I am famished.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.193
Shall we dine?

02:41.195 --> 02:43.195
yes, let's do that.

02:46.933 --> 02:49.201
Needless to say,
dinner was a disaster,

02:49.203 --> 02:51.370
But the real disaster
is that

02:51.372 --> 02:53.205
Alexis has moved in
with this guy.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.506
He's just so wrong for her.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.175
Yeah, well,
she'll figure it out.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.843
At least she's not living
in squalor. That's good.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.912
No, it's not good.
I was hoping for squalor.

02:59.914 --> 03:02.481
I was counting on squalor.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.516
Because alexis cannot last
in squalor.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.518
I was just hoping this
whole thing would blow over.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.854
She would see pi
for the ambition-free hippie

03:08.856 --> 03:10.289
That he is,
and now he's morphed

03:10.291 --> 03:12.558
Into some kind of
new age crusader.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.761
It's as though he's turned
being a charming man-child

03:15.763 --> 03:19.431
Yeah, that doesn't sound
familiar, does it?

03:19.433 --> 03:21.934
What I need is a good murder
so I can stop obsessing.

03:21.936 --> 03:25.204
well, we got one
for you, castle.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.240
Our victim is
susannah richland, 28.

03:28.242 --> 03:31.243
Business card says
she's an accountant.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.751
How does an accountant
end up like this?

03:39.753 --> 03:44.289
Look at those marks on her hand.
They look like stigmata.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.525
Yeah, the way she's posed
might suggest a crucifixion.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.293
except the cause of death

03:48.295 --> 03:49.995
Is probably that stab wound
to the throat

03:49.997 --> 03:53.432
From a double-edged blade
like a dagger.

03:53.434 --> 03:56.268
A dagger? Maybe this is some kind
of ritualistic sacrifice.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.338
Or maybe the killer wanted
to make it look like it was.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.540
Note the lack of blood.
I'd say she was moved here

04:01.542 --> 04:04.009
But killed somewhere else.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.545
Might I suggest
a sacrificial altar?

04:06.547 --> 04:08.247
No, you may not.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.282
Do we have a time of death?

04:10.284 --> 04:12.517
I'm thinking
10:00 to midnight.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.019
All right, uh,
I'll start a canvass

04:14.021 --> 04:15.887
And start gathering
security video,

04:15.889 --> 04:18.290
See if I can find someone
who witnessed the body drop.

04:18.291 --> 04:22.027
See if they have any other
murders with the same m.O.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.763
Yeah, okay hey, just got off the phone
with susannah's boss.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.965
He knows of nothing in her life
that would explain this.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.034
But he did say she'd been
acting odd lately

04:29.036 --> 04:30.335
And that she'd asked
for a week off

04:30.337 --> 04:31.937
To handle a personal matter.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.640
No. Neither did any
of her co-workers.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.674
All right,
contact her family and friends.

04:35.676 --> 04:39.544
- Castle and I are gonna go
to her apartment. - All right.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.681
did you know
of any personal matters

04:42.683 --> 04:43.982
She might have been
dealing with?

04:43.984 --> 04:47.986
Last week, she started keeping
odd hours, staying out too late.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.588
It wasn't like her.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.990
Did she have any visitors,
any men in her life?

04:51.992 --> 04:55.961
be sure to lock up
when you're done.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.596
Thanks.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.067
An apparently
ordinary accountant

05:02.069 --> 05:04.936
Brutally slain
and ritually posed,

05:04.938 --> 05:07.606
All while tending
to a personal matter

05:07.608 --> 05:08.774
Shrouded in secrecy.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.575
It's not shrouded
in secrecy.

05:10.577 --> 05:13.078
We just don't know
what it is yet.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.780
Yeah. My version
has more dramatic flair.

05:14.782 --> 05:18.083
She's got a lot of books here
on medieval history.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.551
Maybe her dark secret

05:19.553 --> 05:22.054
Has something to do
with the dark ages.

05:22.056 --> 05:23.422
That could explain the way
we found her body.

05:23.424 --> 05:27.025
Castle, you might be on
to something.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.593
Look at this.

05:28.595 --> 05:32.064
Religious icons
and pagan symbols.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.066
This fascination of hers
is recent.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.335
All these books were checked out
of the library three days ago.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.537
Okay, so what does that
have to do with her murder?

05:38.539 --> 05:39.805
I think I know the answer.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.574
The pentagram,
the all-seeing eye...

05:42.576 --> 05:44.109
Both of those are power objects
in dark magic.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.812
All these elements...
earth, air,

05:46.814 --> 05:51.016
Fire, water, ether...
all medieval symbols

05:51.018 --> 05:53.118
That are sometimes associated
with satanic practices.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.853
Susannah
was into the occult.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.989
The occult?
I know my cousin.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.025
No way was she mixed up
with that kind of thing.

06:00.027 --> 06:03.795
Well, we found these symbols
at her place, mr. Collins,

06:03.797 --> 06:06.865
Along with some books
on medieval history.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.066
Any idea why
they'd be there?

06:08.068 --> 06:11.837
No. I mean,
she was a history buff,

06:11.839 --> 06:14.373
But more american history,
not that kind of thing.

06:14.375 --> 06:17.008
Did she have any, uh, enemies
in her life, mr. Collins?

06:17.010 --> 06:18.744
Any relationship issues?

06:18.746 --> 06:23.014
I just... I don't understand
who would do this to her.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.417
<i>When was the last time
you saw her?</i>

06:25.419 --> 06:28.053
Maybe... Three weeks ago.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.721
I was her only family,

06:29.723 --> 06:32.791
So we'd get together for dinner
every few months.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.993
But it's strange.
she, um...

06:34.995 --> 06:38.096
She actually called me
last night out of the blue.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.165
And what did she say?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.833
That she had something

06:41.835 --> 06:44.035
That she wanted
to talk to me about.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.570
What was that?

06:45.572 --> 06:47.773
I didn't even get a chance
to ask.

06:47.775 --> 06:48.940
She got interrupted
or something,

06:48.942 --> 06:51.109
Said she'd call me
right back,

06:51.111 --> 06:54.780
But she never did.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.082
But now I know why.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.853
So the fbi doesn't have
any murders in their database

07:01.855 --> 07:03.422
That match this m.O.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.990
Which leaves us
with my theory...

07:04.992 --> 07:07.159
Our victim was dabbling
with black magic,

07:07.161 --> 07:11.797
Or maybe she ran afoul of
some obscure religious sect,

07:11.799 --> 07:15.066
- And they sacrificed her to their pagan deity.
- What are you doing?

07:15.068 --> 07:17.002
Making stuff up,
just like you do.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.470
Yeah,
because that's my job.

07:18.472 --> 07:19.838
It's your job
to follow the evidence.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.540
You're messing with
the natural order of things.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.775
Hey, guys?
Something you need to see.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.911
So our canvass couldn't come up
with anyone

07:25.913 --> 07:28.580
Who witnessed the body dump,
but susannah had

07:28.582 --> 07:30.015
A metrocard in her pocket.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.117
So I had m.T.A.
Run its history.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.152
Her card was swiped last night
on an m3 bus.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.687
She got on it at 8:45
near her apartment.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.955
Where was she going?

07:36.957 --> 07:39.458
Bus cam has her exiting
at west 168th street,

07:39.460 --> 07:42.227
That's about a half mile
from where her body was found.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.528
What was she doing
way up there?

07:43.530 --> 07:47.499
But I checked traffic cam
footage in a 10-block radius,

07:47.501 --> 07:50.469
And I found susannah
crossing st. Nicholas

07:50.471 --> 07:53.772
At west 173rd street.

07:53.774 --> 07:57.108
And it looks like
she had company.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.178
- A monk?
- Check out the time stamp... 10:05,

08:00.180 --> 08:02.981
- Right in our time-of-death window.
- A posed body,

08:02.983 --> 08:07.018
Mysterious medieval symbols,
and now a murderous monk.

08:07.020 --> 08:10.088
It's a real life
"da vinci code."

08:18.064 --> 08:21.266
Do we have any idea
who this guy is?

08:21.268 --> 08:25.103
he's part of
a brotherhood of assassins,

08:25.105 --> 08:27.272
Chosen to guard
an ancient secret.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.242
- Castle... - Stalking a woman obsessed
with medieval symbols?

08:30.244 --> 08:32.811
This is what
the evidence suggests.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.044
Can we get a closer look
at his face?

08:34.047 --> 08:35.246
He never turns his head.

08:35.249 --> 08:39.049
Wait. Zoom in on his scalp.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.921
There. You see that?

08:42.923 --> 08:44.089
Ritual markings,

08:44.091 --> 08:46.191
Left by some
unholy initiation.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.261
I'll see if I can look
into a medical procedure

08:49.263 --> 08:51.563
That could cause this.
Might help us I.D. Him.

08:53.266 --> 08:58.036
I'm telling you, our monk,
our victim, and these symbols

08:58.038 --> 09:01.640
I'm betting susannah richland
decoded these symbols

09:01.642 --> 09:03.575
And uncovered some
dark, long-held secret,

09:03.577 --> 09:04.876
Paid for it with her life.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.579
Look, castle, I agree
that her recent interest

09:07.581 --> 09:08.880
In all things medieval

09:08.882 --> 09:10.949
May be relevant,
but it doesn't mean

09:10.951 --> 09:13.184
That she was killed
in some baroque plot.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.720
Well, I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.556
Castle might be right about
this "da vinci code" thing.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.225
Don't... Ruin it.

09:20.227 --> 09:24.162
She made a call
to a professor jason byford

09:24.164 --> 09:26.631
At hudson university
the day before she died,

09:26.633 --> 09:30.302
He's an expert in
ancient languages and symbology.

09:30.304 --> 09:33.805
It's not a baroque plot.
It's a bestseller plot.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.774
Well, at the very least,
he should be able to tell us

09:35.776 --> 09:38.610
Castle and I will go
talk to him.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.345
In the meantime, I need you
to go to the morgue.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.147
- Lanie says she has something.
- Okay.

09:42.149 --> 09:46.117
So I was finally able
to identify the murder weapon.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.185
Thought you said
it was a dagger.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.954
I know what I said,
but based on

09:48.956 --> 09:51.723
The curvature of the wound
and the injuries to her neck,

09:51.725 --> 09:53.291
Our victim was stabbed
with a sword.

09:53.293 --> 09:57.963
- A sword?
- Yes, a double-edged sabre like this...

09:57.965 --> 10:00.599
With a hilt that left
a crenelated bruising pattern

10:00.601 --> 10:01.833
On her neck.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.635
Very old school.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.170
I took a closer look
at her hand injuries,

10:05.172 --> 10:09.207
There was ink residue
in this wound on her palm.

10:09.209 --> 10:12.110
I was able to draw it up
from the lower dermis.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.613
It looks like she drew
this symbol on her hand.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.247
All right. I gotta get this
to beckett.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.950
head back to the precinct.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.620
yes, I met with susannah.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.321
People often call
with research questions,

10:23.323 --> 10:24.789
So I try to be helpful.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.291
She wanted to know
what these symbols meant.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.727
What did you tell her?
I said that it all depends.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.196
Some of these have existed
for thousands of years.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.898
They signify different things
to different cultures.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.668
Are any of them tied to
anything dangerous, like cults?

10:36.670 --> 10:40.071
But mostly, these are associated
with the freemasons,

10:40.073 --> 10:43.041
Which is why you see so many on
buildings and icons in the u.S.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.243
A lot of our founding fathers
were freemasons.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.278
Yes. I saw "national treasure."

10:47.280 --> 10:49.247
As did I, sadly.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.149
Some odious factual errors.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.219
Though it is true that
during the american revolution,

10:54.221 --> 10:56.221
Symbols like these
were used as markers

10:56.223 --> 10:58.223
For war secrets
and buried treasure.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.393
Oh... Treasure?

11:01.395 --> 11:03.395
Like the british gold
left behind

11:03.397 --> 11:05.263
When they lost the war
or the missing half dimes...

11:05.265 --> 11:08.199
The first coins minted
by the u.S. Treasury.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.802
Professor, did susannah
ask you about this symbol?

11:11.871 --> 11:13.304
Uh...

11:13.306 --> 11:14.372
I don't believe so. Why?

11:14.374 --> 11:17.075
She was killed last night,

11:17.077 --> 11:19.310
And we believe all of
these symbols are relevant.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.212
Killed?

11:22.415 --> 11:23.848
What is it?

11:23.850 --> 11:27.819
Uh, um, there's something
you need to see.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.454
she had this letter with her.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.257
She wanted to know if it
was connected to the symbols.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.259
Now I'd never seen
anything quite like it,

11:34.261 --> 11:36.094
So I, uh, I, um,

11:36.096 --> 11:38.129
Well, I snuck a picture of it
while she wasn't looking.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.031
"I, theodore rose,
of new york city,

11:40.033 --> 11:42.133
"a loyal patriot
of sound mind and body,

11:42.135 --> 11:44.402
Do the... to make this
my last will and testament."

11:44.404 --> 11:46.404
Theodore rose was
an 18th-century stonemason

11:46.406 --> 11:48.339
Of some renown,
but it's more than a will.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.476
"so I pass to them still living
this key

11:51.478 --> 11:53.978
"which marks the way
to our great secret,

11:53.980 --> 11:55.313
Enshrined within the city."

11:55.315 --> 11:57.182
And this letter is the key
to finding it.

11:57.184 --> 12:00.952
She didn't say, but according
to the date and seal,

12:00.954 --> 12:02.787
It was written in 1798.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.355
And the latin phrases...
what do they mean?

12:04.357 --> 12:06.357
Well, I translated some of them
for her.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.126
They're riddles of some kind.
This one says

12:08.128 --> 12:11.162
"the world turns between
the heavens and the ash heap."

12:11.164 --> 12:13.298
They're not riddles.
They're clues...

12:13.300 --> 12:15.467
Clues leading to some
great masonic treasure.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.936
And this last line could be why
she was murdered.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.437
<i>"periculum et dolor..."</i>

12:19.439 --> 12:22.006
My latin is pretty rusty,
but I think that means

12:22.008 --> 12:25.176
"peril and woe to him
who follows this path

12:25.178 --> 12:26.444
With a dark heart."

12:34.154 --> 12:36.121
Beckett.
So that pattern

12:36.123 --> 12:39.023
Of scars on our monk's dome
was from a procedure called

12:39.025 --> 12:41.226
Stereotactic brain surgery.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.460
Okay, can that get us
an I.D.?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.295
Because medical records
are confidential.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.232
I took a shot that our guy
did some time.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.901
19 men in the system
had this surgery,

12:49.903 --> 12:52.170
But only one had scars
that were an exact match

12:52.172 --> 12:54.506
To the monk...
benjamin wade.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.207
He got surgery
to remove a tumor

12:56.209 --> 12:57.275
While doing a stretch
at green haven

12:57.277 --> 12:58.510
For attempted murder.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.111
hear that, castle?

13:00.113 --> 13:03.348
Our suspect is an ex-con...
a felonious monk.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.284
Hey, beckett, got no current
address on benjamin wade,

13:06.286 --> 13:07.786
But he did have an apartment
in the bronx

13:07.788 --> 13:11.389
Okay, check it out. See if
anyone knows where he is now.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.061
I don't think anyone here
can give us a line on wade.

13:17.063 --> 13:18.930
Local p.D. Says this place
has been taken over

13:18.932 --> 13:21.399
By squatters and crackheads.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.369
Look at this place.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.204
We're gonna get hepatitis
just breathing the air.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.174
This is it. It's where
wade used to live.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.441
Home crack home.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.080
leave me alone!

13:37.150 --> 13:39.184
I don't want you here.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.119
N.Y.P.D.
Somebody help me.

13:53.132 --> 13:54.132
Police!

13:54.134 --> 13:56.334
N.Y.P.D.! Don't move!

13:57.570 --> 13:59.470
Benjamin wade, you're under
arrest for murder.

14:04.109 --> 14:07.178
Recognize her, mr. Wade?

14:12.519 --> 14:16.254
And this is you,
stalking her

14:16.256 --> 14:18.223
Shortly
before she was killed.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.325
You care to explain?

14:23.229 --> 14:25.129
Maybe he took
a vow of silence.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.365
You know,
silent but deadly.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.234
Assuming he's a real monk.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.136
<i>Actually, I am a monk.</i>

14:32.138 --> 14:35.240
I've just learned to think
before I speak.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.408
I joined the franciscan order
of perpetual hope

14:37.410 --> 14:38.643
After I left prison.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.245
This monastery
that you're a part of...

14:40.247 --> 14:42.113
Does it happen to be
in washington heights?

14:42.115 --> 14:45.884
Because that's exactly where
we found susannah richland,

14:45.886 --> 14:48.119
And given your record...

14:48.121 --> 14:52.924
After my brain tumor,
I had a spiritual awakening.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.959
Found a purpose.

14:54.961 --> 14:56.361
Then what were you doing
in a crack house?

14:56.363 --> 14:59.063
I was tending to the lost.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.132
Wasn't stalking this woman.
I was...

15:01.134 --> 15:02.367
I was trying to protect her.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.069
I found her
in a monastery chapel.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.305
She was kneeling
by the prayer candles.

15:07.307 --> 15:10.041
Said the place
was special to her family.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.510
So I left her
to pray in peace,

15:12.512 --> 15:16.214
And this guy shows up...
brown long hair, glasses.

15:16.216 --> 15:19.250
He's wearing this hat. Starts
asking me questions about her.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.185
Wants to know what
she's doing there. He's upset.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.220
He seems aggressive.

15:22.222 --> 15:25.189
Mr. Wade,
that's you following her,

15:25.191 --> 15:26.591
Not some other guy.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.593
I thought that
he was gonna go after her.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.229
So I did. I followed her
until she got into a cab,

15:31.231 --> 15:33.131
And then I came back
to the monastery.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.399
Really?

15:34.401 --> 15:37.201
Okay.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.303
Describe the cab.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.938
It was a cab.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.439
License plate.
Medallion number.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.207
I don't remember.
It was a...

15:43.209 --> 15:45.176
Prius, maybe.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.978
There are
hundreds of those.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.980
A good storyteller
uses details.

15:48.982 --> 15:53.384
It's not a lie. There was an ad
for "wicked" on top of it.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.019
"wicked."

15:55.021 --> 15:58.556
That's nice. It's precise.
Freudian little detail.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.591
But still a lie.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.460
<i>So here's what's not
a lie.</i>

16:02.462 --> 16:04.662
Just called
the franciscan order.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.597
Turns out benjamin wade
really is a monk.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.699
And our murderer.

16:07.701 --> 16:11.736
Wait. You guys are
on the same page about this guy?

16:11.738 --> 16:13.304
Not exactly.
I think he's guilty

16:13.306 --> 16:15.139
Because of his contact
with the victim,

16:15.141 --> 16:17.408
The stalking,
and his history of violence.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.044
I think he's guilty because
of his contact with the victim,

16:20.046 --> 16:22.246
The stalking, and his role
in a sinister conspiracy

16:22.248 --> 16:25.550
I can't believe you're really
buying into that letter.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.118
I can't believe you aren't.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.553
I did a little research into
the author of our letter...

16:28.555 --> 16:30.088
Mr. Theodore rose.

16:30.090 --> 16:33.291
Did you know he was
a 33rd degree master mason?

16:33.293 --> 16:36.494
So that makes him, what,
like a freemason black belt?

16:36.496 --> 16:39.564
Way better than that.
He was a patriot spy.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.667
He wrote codes and ciphers
during the american revolution,

16:42.669 --> 16:45.269
Meaning this letter could be
the key to finding

16:45.271 --> 16:47.305
The great secret
of the masons,

16:47.307 --> 16:49.207
Enshrined somewhere
within the city.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.308
Why? Because you want it
to be?

16:50.310 --> 16:52.143
Partly, and because

16:52.145 --> 16:54.012
It's the only story
that makes sense.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.214
Shadowy brotherhood
guarding rose's secret

16:56.216 --> 17:00.318
Susannah got too close,
so they sent their monk assassin

17:00.320 --> 17:04.088
Yeah, about that... uh,
wade's lawyer's here.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.357
He says we need to charge
his client or let him go.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.026
We don't have enough
to charge him.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.694
Why don't we try
to keep him until we do?

17:10.696 --> 17:12.329
Put wade in
with a sketch artist.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.531
Have him describe that guy

17:13.532 --> 17:15.500
That was supposedly
stalking susannah.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.535
That'll buy castle and I
enough time

17:17.537 --> 17:20.471
To tear his alibi apart,
and just to cover our bases,

17:20.473 --> 17:22.373
You look into that cab
that wade described.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.142
Really? You want me
to track down a cab

17:24.144 --> 17:25.542
Off a banner ad
for "wicked"?

17:25.545 --> 17:28.212
Impress me.

17:30.516 --> 17:34.385
You know, there are times
I wish she stayed in d.C.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.355
I'm sorry, detective,
but you're wrong.

17:37.357 --> 17:40.224
Brother benjamin was in
his quarters at the time you say

17:40.226 --> 17:41.492
This young woman
was killed.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.294
And can anyone else
verify that?

17:43.296 --> 17:46.197
At least seven other members
of our order saw him.

17:46.199 --> 17:50.201
And... What exactly is
the mission of your order?

17:50.203 --> 17:54.439
To live by and share
the teachings of christ.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.773
I think you

17:55.775 --> 18:00.445
Left out the part about
protecting a great secret.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.780
I'm afraid
I don't understand.

18:02.782 --> 18:03.781
Don't you?

18:03.783 --> 18:05.483
No, I don't.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.853
Uh... thank you...
So much for your time.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.323
"thank you for your time"?
That's it?

18:12.325 --> 18:13.524
Yeah, until we get
the statements

18:13.526 --> 18:16.461
Look, they're all gonna
tell you the same thing.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.096
Don't you see?

18:18.098 --> 18:21.332
These monks... they're in it
up to their hoods.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.168
Unless... Unless they're not
protecting the great secret

18:24.170 --> 18:26.304
And they're actually
trying to find it, too.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.206
Because, like the ark
of the covenant,

18:28.208 --> 18:30.608
It is a source
of ultimate power.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.310
Castle,
these monks took vows

18:32.312 --> 18:34.212
Of poverty, chastity,
and obedience.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.247
I don't see them
trying to take over the world.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.782
World.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.617
What?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.552
Theodore rose's letter.

18:42.721 --> 18:46.290
There was that one clue
in latin. Uh...

18:46.292 --> 18:49.227
"the world turns
between the heavens

18:49.229 --> 18:50.795
And the ash heap."

18:50.797 --> 18:53.331
In latin, the word
for "ash heap"

18:53.333 --> 18:54.799
Also means "altar."

18:54.801 --> 18:57.568
The heavens are depicted
in that stained glass.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.504
And the altar is
right underneath it.

18:59.506 --> 19:02.240
So the clues led her
to this chapel, but why?

19:02.242 --> 19:03.841
The prayer candles.

19:07.346 --> 19:08.880
So this must be where wade

19:08.882 --> 19:11.315
Said he found
susannah kneeling.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.252
Castle, look.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.354
There's something carved
in that base stone.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.490
that's the symbol
she drew on her hand.

19:19.492 --> 19:23.528
Must lead to other places
where the symbols are hidden,

19:23.530 --> 19:25.296
But what are they for?
Listen to this.

19:25.298 --> 19:30.234
"for gods and men alike
doth lame hephaestus strike."

19:30.236 --> 19:32.270
I know what that means.
I know where that is.

19:32.272 --> 19:35.239
- You do? -Yeah. Hephaestus was
the greek god of blacksmiths.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.208
His forge
was in mount etna.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.343
There's an old blacksmith's shop
right here in lower manhattan

19:39.345 --> 19:41.579
It's been there
since the 1700s.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.182
I know because I was there

19:44.184 --> 19:45.216
With... Alexis.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.918
It was... A field trip.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.686
Third grade, but that...
that's gotta be it.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.288
Our victim was killed
with a sword.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.455
If there's
an old blacksmith shop,

19:51.457 --> 19:52.723
That could be
our crime scene.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.326
A clue trail
to a freemason secret

19:55.328 --> 19:56.794
That people
would kill for...

19:56.796 --> 19:59.363
This case just
keeps getting better.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.966
So maybe what benjamin wade
actually did that night

20:01.968 --> 20:04.368
Was follow susannah
to this blacksmith shop.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.270
Castle, we don't even know
if she was here.

20:06.272 --> 20:07.638
Oh, she was here,
all right,

20:07.640 --> 20:09.273
On the verge
of solving the puzzle

20:09.275 --> 20:10.474
When her life
was cut tragically short.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.476
This is the place.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.479
I never knew this was here.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.319
Wow, this is incredible.

20:21.321 --> 20:24.255
Shouldn't there be
a... Docent

20:24.257 --> 20:26.490
Or some sweaty guy
hammering metal standing around?

20:26.492 --> 20:27.692
Yeah.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.460
hello?!

20:29.462 --> 20:30.895
Is there a smithy hereabouts?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.797
We have traveled
many a mile to the...

20:32.799 --> 20:34.532
is this annoying?

20:34.534 --> 20:36.634
Yeah. You know what?
I'm gonna check in back.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.469
Why don't you take
a look around here?

20:38.471 --> 20:39.804
If this is
our crime scene,

20:39.806 --> 20:40.938
There might be signs
of struggle.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.242
Right.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.944
Ooh.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.946
Have it...

20:48.948 --> 20:50.348
Want it...

20:50.350 --> 20:51.849
Need it...

20:51.851 --> 20:53.251
Got it... Need it...

20:53.253 --> 20:56.821
You should not have come here
looking for the sign,

20:56.823 --> 20:58.389
For only death awaits you.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.862
Well, now...

21:04.864 --> 21:06.697
That wouldn't happen to be
a double-edged saber

21:06.699 --> 21:10.301
With a crenelated hilt,
now, would it?

21:13.972 --> 21:15.906
You have trespassed
into secrets

21:15.908 --> 21:17.041
Beyond your comprehension.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.809
You will pay
with your life.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.545
Okay. O-okay, b-but just...
Before you kill me,

21:21.547 --> 21:23.481
There's one thing
you should know.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.882
And what is that?

21:24.884 --> 21:28.853
<i>I am really good at this.</i>

21:33.393 --> 21:36.527
Uhh! You're not so bad
yourself.

21:36.529 --> 21:40.398
And what do you know about
the last will of theodore rose?

21:40.400 --> 21:43.901
For 200 years, my people
have guarded that secret.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.736
It will go with me
to my grave... Or yours!

22:06.792 --> 22:09.727
Uhh!

22:09.729 --> 22:11.929
now who are you?

22:11.931 --> 22:14.031
It's not important who I am.

22:14.033 --> 22:17.668
The win is yours.
The sign shall be revealed.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.509
That's the symbol
from susannah's board.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.412
She was here. It was you.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.780
You're the one
who killed her.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.749
Whoa, wait a minute.
You won, man.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.384
You can put
the sword down now.

22:33.386 --> 22:34.919
Not until you tell me
who you are

22:34.921 --> 22:37.421
And why you killed
susannah richland. Beckett!

22:37.423 --> 22:38.923
I think there's been some kind
of mistake here.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.424
No, no, no, no mistake.

22:40.426 --> 22:41.892
Susannah was stabbed
through the throat

22:41.894 --> 22:45.463
With a double-edged saber
by you or one of your people.

22:45.465 --> 22:46.497
I'm sorry.
I'm a little lost here.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.032
Did they change the script?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.800
'cause if they did,
they didn't tell me.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.536
Script?

22:52.538 --> 22:54.472
What script?

22:54.474 --> 22:55.873
The scavenger hunt.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.380
Castle?

23:02.382 --> 23:04.849
What's going on?

23:06.818 --> 23:08.085
A scavenger hunt?

23:08.087 --> 23:11.088
So the clues, the symbol...
it's all just a game?

23:11.090 --> 23:12.523
It's a fund-raiser

23:12.525 --> 23:14.859
For the new york
historical institute.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.827
The clues lead
to historic buildings,

23:16.829 --> 23:19.096
Where the players collect
these old symbols.

23:19.098 --> 23:22.633
They hire actors like me to
interact with the contestants.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.535
I usually work
renaissance fairs.

23:24.537 --> 23:27.171
Was this woman
one of your contestants?

23:27.173 --> 23:30.808
Yeah. She came through here
couple days ago.

23:30.810 --> 23:31.909
She was killed?

23:31.911 --> 23:35.179
Almost exactly like the one
you were using.

23:35.181 --> 23:38.115
That was a stunt weapon.
It's harmless. They all are.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.651
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm just an actor.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.853
I wasn't even
working here last night.

23:42.855 --> 23:45.656
Look, please, call the new york
historical institute.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.925
Talk to nolan burns,
their director.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.126
This is all just a game.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.595
Of course
it was just a game.

23:51.597 --> 23:55.132
Every year, more and more
historic new york buildings

23:55.134 --> 23:57.902
And as director
of the historical institute,

23:57.904 --> 24:00.604
I was looking for a fun way
to raise awareness.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.939
Mr. Burns, these symbols

24:01.941 --> 24:04.041
That susannah richland
took pictures of...

24:04.043 --> 24:06.777
Are those also a part
of the game?

24:06.779 --> 24:09.914
Yes, these are all...
Symbols used in the game.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.116
Looks like
she found them all.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.717
She might have won.

24:13.719 --> 24:15.719
Is it possible that someone
would have killed her

24:15.721 --> 24:17.121
To get a competitive edge?

24:17.123 --> 24:19.056
Prize money is $2,500.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.025
Some of the contestants
spent more than that

24:21.027 --> 24:22.726
In travel expenses.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.929
Could these symbols
mean something else?

24:24.931 --> 24:26.130
Something dangerous?

24:26.132 --> 24:27.565
Not that I'm aware of.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.767
I do know they can be found
on buildings

24:29.769 --> 24:31.602
Dating as far back
as the 1700s,

24:31.604 --> 24:32.970
Which is why I used them.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.038
It's just...

24:34.040 --> 24:36.073
Our victim had this letter
on her.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.543
It's from an 18th-century
freemason named theodore rose.

24:39.545 --> 24:42.813
In it, he speaks
of a great hidden secret.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.815
It'd be
"enshrined in the city."

24:44.817 --> 24:46.750
The letter was part
of the game.

24:46.752 --> 24:48.786
We had it hand-written
on parchment...

24:48.788 --> 24:50.488
One for each contestant.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.622
But rose is real.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.958
He had a penchant
for clues and ciphers.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.927
Exactly. He brought
some authenticity.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.563
And the fact that he was
a freemason

24:59.565 --> 25:03.934
Made rose the perfect person
on whom to base the game.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.203
So I drew
from his writings,

25:06.205 --> 25:08.973
And the rest I pulled
from freemason history.

25:08.975 --> 25:13.043
I don't see how any of this
would lead to someone's death.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.212
Regardless,
I'm gonna need the names

25:15.214 --> 25:16.914
Of all of the contestants.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.917
With the event planning company,
games ultra.

25:19.919 --> 25:22.152
They handled
the registration.

25:22.154 --> 25:25.990
Can't believe all this time,
it was all just make-believe.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.825
Castle,
you didn't really believe

25:27.827 --> 25:29.193
That this was gonna lead
to some

25:29.195 --> 25:31.061
Great freemason treasure,
did you?

25:31.063 --> 25:33.030
No, of course not.
That'd be foolish.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.866
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go home

25:35.868 --> 25:38.002
To wallow in what is perhaps
the most disappointing day

25:38.004 --> 25:39.870
Of my crime-solving career.

25:39.872 --> 25:43.007
Okay, I'll come by later
and try to cheer you up.

25:46.845 --> 25:49.213
Did we get the list of
contestants from games ultra?

25:49.215 --> 25:51.081
Yep, and the contestant
applications

25:51.083 --> 25:52.917
Had to include a photo.
Take a look at this dude.

25:52.919 --> 25:57.054
Well, check out the sketch
that our monk gave us of the guy

25:57.056 --> 25:59.957
That he says
was following susannah.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.127
Well, it's the same guy.

26:03.129 --> 26:06.163
okay. So... What do we know

26:06.165 --> 26:08.165
About tom stevens?

26:08.167 --> 26:09.767
Well, his name and address
are bogus.

26:09.769 --> 26:10.834
Everything
on the application is.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.002
None of this information
is real.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.704
And he had to be the guy
who killed her.

26:13.706 --> 26:19.877
Well, his name might be fake,
but his money is real.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.879
And there you go.
Paid with a check.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.280
If we can trace
that payment...

26:23.282 --> 26:24.882
Then we might be able
to I.D. Him.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.650
All right, see where games ultra
keeps their accounts

26:26.652 --> 26:27.718
And hit that bank
first thing in the morning.

26:27.720 --> 26:28.986
I want this guy found.

26:32.658 --> 26:33.891
richard?

26:33.893 --> 26:35.926
<i>Richard.</i>

26:35.928 --> 26:36.894
I'm sorry. What?

26:36.896 --> 26:38.963
What is all this?

26:38.965 --> 26:41.966
Oh, just some... Game.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.934
Well, you might wanna pay
attention to the real world

26:43.936 --> 26:47.838
Alexis is furious with you
over your behavior

26:47.840 --> 26:50.908
At dinner the other night,
and I must say, I agree.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.142
Come on.
It wasn't that bad.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.811
You insulted her apartment,

26:53.813 --> 26:55.846
You made fun
of her boyfriend's career.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.381
Mother,
he's counting bees.

26:57.383 --> 27:00.017
Yes, and it is important
to him,

27:00.019 --> 27:01.919
As alexis is important
to him.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.688
I just don't even understand.
Why is she even with him?

27:04.690 --> 27:07.992
Now will she want it
next week or next month?

27:07.994 --> 27:09.226
Who knows?

27:09.228 --> 27:11.662
But this is what
she wants today,

27:11.664 --> 27:14.365
And if you want her
to be a part of your life,

27:14.367 --> 27:18.002
Then you are going to have
to change your point of view.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.238
You're right, mother.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.207
Of course I'm right. Good.

27:30.782 --> 27:32.116
point of view...

27:41.960 --> 27:43.894
This isn't a game.

27:46.298 --> 27:49.667
This isn't a game at all.

27:52.704 --> 27:53.871
No luck.

27:53.873 --> 27:59.076
But it was a cashier's check,
so there's no way to trace it.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.244
Hiding his identity,

28:00.246 --> 28:03.247
Following our victim
just before she died.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.349
This has gotta be
our killer.

28:05.351 --> 28:08.185
<i>Okay. I finally
tracked down that cab</i>

28:08.187 --> 28:09.420
That our victim got into...

28:09.422 --> 28:11.989
The one with the "wicked"
banner ad on top.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.357
So first, I had to call
the theater

28:13.359 --> 28:14.792
Where "wicked" was playing.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.460
They directed me
to a p.R. Firm who then

28:16.462 --> 28:19.129
Sent me to an ad agency

28:19.131 --> 28:21.231
That sells space on the top
of cabs, and five cabs...

28:21.233 --> 28:23.801
- Did you talk to the cabbie or not?
- Yes.

28:23.803 --> 28:27.037
Yes, I did. The cabbie confirmed
that he picked up susannah

28:27.039 --> 28:29.273
In washington heights
at 10:10 p.M.

28:29.275 --> 28:30.841
<i>So our monk was
telling the truth.</i>

28:30.843 --> 28:34.178
That's the odd part.
He didn't take her anywhere.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.379
What do you mean?
Susannah just had him

28:35.381 --> 28:36.914
Drive around the neighborhood
for 45 minutes

28:36.916 --> 28:38.348
And dropped her back off
at the chapel.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.418
Why would she go back there
the same night?

28:41.420 --> 28:43.387
I'll tell you why.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.857
Because susannah realized
it wasn't just a game.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.726
Castle, please don't tell me
that you're still on...

28:48.728 --> 28:51.195
Burns told us
that he based the game

28:51.197 --> 28:52.996
On some of the writings
of theodore rose.

28:52.998 --> 28:54.865
Now what if rose's clues
were real

28:54.867 --> 28:56.266
And actually led somewhere?

28:56.268 --> 28:59.336
What if susannah
figured that out?

28:59.338 --> 29:02.272
Here are all our symbols.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.907
They didn't seem to relate
to each other

29:03.909 --> 29:08.112
Until you add this one... the one
susannah drew on her hand.

29:08.114 --> 29:11.381
The one she found at the chapel
the night she was killed.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.383
They all fit together.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.919
Final piece. Without it,
the others didn't fit.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.388
That's why the killer
scraped it off her hand.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.257
He didn't want her
or anyone else

29:20.259 --> 29:21.825
To be able to figure it out.

29:21.827 --> 29:22.960
Okay, so the pieces
fit together.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.228
What do they mean?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.431
I don't know, but...

29:27.433 --> 29:30.534
Does this shape
look familiar?

29:32.003 --> 29:34.271
Yes, it does.

29:37.809 --> 29:39.510
Amazing, right?
Yeah.

29:39.512 --> 29:41.178
But what does it mean?

29:41.180 --> 29:43.781
It means that this isn't
a part of any game.

29:43.783 --> 29:47.384
If all those symbols put
together indicate this carving,

29:47.386 --> 29:51.021
Then it has to have
some kind of significance.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.824
Castle, look at this.

29:53.826 --> 29:57.461
Each one of these symbols
has a small letter next to it...

29:57.463 --> 30:00.063
R- o-s-I.

30:00.065 --> 30:03.267
Rosi? Maybe it's supposed
to be his name... rose.

30:03.269 --> 30:07.871
<i>Um... Maybe it's "rois,"
like, uh, french for "king,"</i>

30:07.873 --> 30:10.340
<i>Or, uh, "soir" for evening.</i>

30:10.342 --> 30:11.809
Oh, no, wait.

30:11.811 --> 30:15.179
Earth, air, water, fire,
ether in the center.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.414
In medieval alchemy,
these are the five elements

30:17.416 --> 30:18.816
That make up the universe,

30:18.818 --> 30:20.350
But there's an order
of importance...

30:20.352 --> 30:21.985
Earth, air, water, fire.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.287
We put the letters
in that order,

30:23.289 --> 30:26.523
It's o-r-I...

30:26.525 --> 30:27.591
"s."

30:30.061 --> 30:32.429
<i>"oris."</i>

30:32.431 --> 30:34.331
Latin for "mouth."

30:52.550 --> 30:54.551
Aah!

30:54.553 --> 30:56.620
Aah-ha-ha! I'm just kidding.
Castle!

30:56.622 --> 30:58.589
I can't believe you fell
for that.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.125
<i>There is something
in here, though. Hang on.</i>

31:45.169 --> 31:48.171
Susannah was here.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.140
This is our crime scene.

31:50.142 --> 31:51.642
There's our murder weapon.

31:51.644 --> 31:54.645
Castle, look at this.
These marks are fresh.

31:54.647 --> 31:56.947
Someone was trying
to get inside it.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.949
Susannah must have come
to the chapel that night

31:58.951 --> 32:01.118
And figured out how to
get in here just like we did.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.386
Except the killer found her

32:02.388 --> 32:04.454
Before she was able
to open the sarcophagus.

32:04.456 --> 32:05.923
what do
you think's inside?

32:05.925 --> 32:09.393
But someone thought
it was worth killing for.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.699
Okay.

32:17.268 --> 32:20.604
okay, okay.

32:20.606 --> 32:23.240
Okay. If it's like everything
else we've been doing,

32:23.242 --> 32:26.276
We need to solve a clue
to open it.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.178
Hey, castle,
look at the world.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.113
It's just like the one
in the stained glass

32:30.115 --> 32:34.584
"the world spins between
the heavens and the ash heap."

32:34.586 --> 32:37.421
Ashes to ashes. The coffin
could be the ash heap.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.655
Which means, then, that...

32:38.657 --> 32:41.725
There.
Those are heavens.

32:49.601 --> 32:52.569
"the world turns..."

33:11.122 --> 33:14.224
"1792."

33:14.226 --> 33:16.660
These are the half dimes
professor byford

33:16.662 --> 33:18.628
These are
the very first coins

33:18.630 --> 33:20.330
To be minted
by the u.S. Treasury.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.465
These are worth
a fortune.

33:21.467 --> 33:25.502
Just one of these
went for auction last year.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.372
$1.5 million.

33:28.374 --> 33:29.573
There's gotta be
a thousand of them in here.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.508
Do you have any idea
what that's worth?

33:31.510 --> 33:33.777
I just told you
what it's worth.

33:35.580 --> 33:36.713
Ohh!

33:36.715 --> 33:38.181
What was that?

33:39.418 --> 33:41.018
If I had to guess,
I would say something bad.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.689
No, no.

33:50.461 --> 33:52.029
Oops.

33:56.667 --> 33:58.735
Castle, put the bag of coins
back in the coffin.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.204
Maybe it'll open up
the door again.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.206
Good idea.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.179
Rats.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.215
This is not my idea of going
to the chapel with you.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.483
Do you have a cell signal?

34:13.485 --> 34:15.351
Yeah, it doesn't look
like it.

34:15.353 --> 34:18.088
Well, then
the letter was right.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.755
"peril and woe to him
who follows this path

34:19.757 --> 34:22.292
With a dark heart."
this is it.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.428
Castle, we're not
gonna die in here.

34:24.429 --> 34:26.329
You saw how thick
those walls were.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.498
They're made of stone.
We can yell and scream

34:28.500 --> 34:30.367
All day long.
No one's gonna hear.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.768
It's not like they stocked up
this place with supplies.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.505
And what's gonna happen when we
get tired of eating candle wax?

34:35.507 --> 34:37.373
No, we're gonna get
out of here.

34:37.376 --> 34:38.842
There has to be a way out.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.444
Okay, yeah, you know what?
You're right.

34:40.446 --> 34:44.447
All right, this is just
theodore rose testing us.

34:44.449 --> 34:47.150
There's gotta be another clue,
another puzzle.

34:47.152 --> 34:49.652
Something to do with his name.
What if...

34:49.655 --> 34:51.420
What if it's an anagram?

34:51.422 --> 34:55.391
Theodore rose... Is...

34:55.393 --> 34:58.728
Heed or toes.

34:58.730 --> 35:01.298
No. Theodore rose...

35:01.300 --> 35:04.334
He... Do rooster.

35:04.336 --> 35:05.735
That's inappropriate.
Okay.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.304
Theodore rose,
theodore rose.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.605
Deer shot oreo.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.341
Oh, they didn't have oreos
in the 1700s.

35:11.343 --> 35:14.778
- Castle, there might be another way
out of here. - I'm all ears.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.147
Susannah's killer knows
that the half dimes

35:17.149 --> 35:19.149
Are still in here.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.351
Eventually, he's gonna
have to come back...

35:21.353 --> 35:25.722
He must be somebody who knew
they existed in the first place.

35:25.724 --> 35:28.625
Someone... Who knew...
All of this...

35:30.862 --> 35:32.596
Was real.

35:32.598 --> 35:35.532
And who better than the person
who wanted everyone to think

35:35.534 --> 35:36.867
That this was just a game?

35:36.869 --> 35:38.635
nolan burns.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.638
The director
of the historical institute.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.174
Castle, I've got bars.

35:44.176 --> 35:45.275
finally.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.511
what's up, beckett?

35:47.513 --> 35:49.312
Espo, you need to get
to the chapel now.

35:49.314 --> 35:52.315
And tell ryan to pick up
nolan burns.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.618
Mr. Burns...

35:54.620 --> 35:57.921
You left out a few details
the last time we spoke.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.923
I don't know what you mean.

36:03.528 --> 36:05.562
You found them.

36:09.534 --> 36:12.235
So it wasn't just a game.

36:14.372 --> 36:17.407
no.

36:17.409 --> 36:20.443
That... Letter
we gave the contestants

36:20.445 --> 36:21.811
Was based
on an actual letter

36:21.813 --> 36:24.648
I found hidden in the building
I was renovating.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.616
I tried to... Follow
the clues myself,

36:26.618 --> 36:28.685
But I couldn't
solve them all.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.855
You set up a scavenger hunt
to solve clues

36:31.857 --> 36:33.523
Through crowdsourcing.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.258
I never thought anyone
would get hurt.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.694
Not hurt, burns.
Murdered.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.362
But not by me, I swear.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.865
I- I told you,
I- I was at home with my family

36:41.867 --> 36:45.902
You also told me that
you didn't know susannah.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.405
I spoke
with your assistant.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.440
You met with her
three months ago.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.409
How did you fail
to mention that?

36:52.411 --> 36:53.910
'cause I knew
how it would look!

36:53.912 --> 36:55.779
And now it looks
even worse.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.781
Now why did you
meet with her?

36:57.783 --> 37:01.418
Because I hoped she would
shed some light

37:01.420 --> 37:03.420
On the rose family history.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.589
You know, something that
might help solve that last clue,

37:05.591 --> 37:06.823
But that was it!

37:06.825 --> 37:08.458
Wait a minute. Go back.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.227
Susannah was an accountant.

37:10.229 --> 37:13.763
Why would she know anything
about the rose family?

37:13.765 --> 37:16.533
Because she was
a direct descendant

37:16.535 --> 37:17.934
Of theodore rose.

37:17.936 --> 37:20.470
The legend of
the missing half dimes

37:20.472 --> 37:22.305
Was family lore.

37:23.874 --> 37:26.676
family lore.

37:31.516 --> 37:34.017
Hey. They said you found
something out

37:34.019 --> 37:39.356
Uh, we did. We, uh, we just need
to go over a few things first.

37:39.358 --> 37:41.558
Now according
to her phone records,

37:41.560 --> 37:45.328
She called you more frequently
over the last few months.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.529
Is there any reason why?

37:46.531 --> 37:48.632
I got the feeling
she was lonely.

37:48.634 --> 37:51.835
A- and did she ever mention
theodore rose?

37:51.837 --> 37:53.970
No. Why would she?

37:53.972 --> 37:57.440
So you're familiar with the lore
of the missing half dimes?

37:57.442 --> 37:59.676
Yeah, sure.
It was a big family myth.

37:59.678 --> 38:03.446
Susannah actually located
the coins.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.749
They were in a hidden crypt.
That's where she was killed.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.350
That's terrible.

38:07.352 --> 38:09.819
Do you know who did it?

38:09.821 --> 38:12.522
Most likely someone who knew
what she was looking for.

38:12.524 --> 38:16.559
C.S.U. Found two sets
of d.N.A. In that crypt.

38:16.561 --> 38:19.696
One was from susannah.
One was from her killer.

38:19.698 --> 38:22.532
Now on a hunch,
I had them compare the two,

38:22.534 --> 38:25.435
And the results indicate
that susannah and her killer

38:25.437 --> 38:26.936
Were related.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.941
C.S.U. Also found
a synthetic hair

38:31.943 --> 38:34.477
Found in a wig
not unlike this one.

38:34.479 --> 38:38.648
You signed up for the game
under a false name.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.518
You used a disguise
so you could track her progress.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.821
It's over, henry.
We know it's you.

38:44.823 --> 38:48.525
My mom's in assisted living.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.727
I work hard,
but I barely get by.

38:50.729 --> 38:53.363
Those half dimes
were gonna change my life.

38:53.365 --> 38:56.466
But susannah said that
she was gonna find them

38:56.468 --> 38:58.668
And then just give them
all away.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.004
Said they were part
of history,

39:01.006 --> 39:03.406
That they belonged
to the people.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.508
She called me that night
with the good news,

39:05.510 --> 39:10.580
And I tried to talk her
out of it one last time.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.582
We argued.

39:13.918 --> 39:16.619
And the next thing
I knew...

39:28.699 --> 39:29.833
Well, I was looking
through the records,

39:29.835 --> 39:31.101
And I found out
there have been

39:31.103 --> 39:34.404
Several rose family weddings
in that chapel.

39:34.406 --> 39:36.439
Susannah had even been there
once years ago.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.842
She must have remembered seeing
that stained glass window.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.510
That's how she was able
to figure out that last clue

39:40.512 --> 39:42.011
When no one else could.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.714
So he could be the only one
that'd ever find it.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.583
So what's gonna happen
to the half dimes?

39:46.585 --> 39:51.688
Well, that'll put the monks'
vow of poverty to the test.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.423
They've already passed that
with flying colors.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.458
Because of the historical
significance of the coins,

39:55.460 --> 39:56.693
They're donating them
to the met.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.928
Hmm. You know...

39:58.930 --> 40:00.463
Here we go.
I gotta go.

40:00.465 --> 40:01.965
It is believed that
george washington

40:01.967 --> 40:05.535
Had those half dimes minted
from martha washington's silver.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.103
Back then,
before the revolution,

40:07.105 --> 40:09.539
It was illegal for anyone
but a king to mint money.

40:09.541 --> 40:12.108
So those coins are worth a lot
more than just their silver.

40:12.110 --> 40:15.779
They're actually more of
a declaration of independence.

40:15.781 --> 40:18.081
That they're going
back to the people,

40:18.083 --> 40:23.119
Speaking of independence,
I gotta go see alexis.

40:32.431 --> 40:34.431
Hi.

40:34.433 --> 40:35.765
Can I come in?

40:35.767 --> 40:38.034
We can talk here.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.973
Look, I'm... Sorry
about how I acted.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.609
Being sorry isn't enough,
dad.

40:48.579 --> 40:49.813
Then what can I do?

40:49.815 --> 40:52.015
What can I do
to make this right?

40:52.017 --> 40:55.685
Do you know how I found out
you had proposed to beckett?

40:55.687 --> 40:59.556
Over the phone with gram
while I was in costa rica.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.191
This is about beckett?

41:01.193 --> 41:03.993
No, but I was hurt
you didn't tell me.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.528
Look,
I was going to tell you.

41:05.530 --> 41:06.863
It just...

41:06.865 --> 41:11.701
I know it did, and I don't know
if it's a good idea

41:11.703 --> 41:14.537
Or if she's really the one,

41:14.539 --> 41:17.574
But you know what?
I accept it.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.843
You know why?

41:19.845 --> 41:21.744
Because
she makes you happy,

41:21.746 --> 41:24.214
The same way
pi makes me happy.

41:24.216 --> 41:27.250
All I want is the same thing
I'm giving you...

41:27.252 --> 41:29.619
Acceptance.

41:31.856 --> 41:34.023
Okay. I accept him.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.658
No, you don't.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.060
Because it's not about
what you say.

41:37.062 --> 41:38.728
It's what's inside.

41:38.730 --> 41:41.731
And I don't want pi
to feel that from you,

41:41.733 --> 41:45.568
And... I don't wanna
feel that either.

41:46.837 --> 41:50.106
Look...

41:50.108 --> 41:51.508
I'll work on it.

41:51.510 --> 41:52.609
I will.

41:52.611 --> 41:53.877
Meantime,

41:53.879 --> 41:57.180
How about we go out
for some makeup ice cream?

41:57.182 --> 41:59.816
Okay? My treat.

41:59.818 --> 42:01.551
No.

42:01.553 --> 42:03.753
I need time to stop
being mad,

42:03.755 --> 42:06.089
And you need time
to figure out a way

42:06.091 --> 42:08.191
To be okay with this.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.928
I'll see you later, dad.
