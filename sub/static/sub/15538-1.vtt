02:14.167 --> 02:15.667
You have the phone?

02:57.045 --> 02:58.244
<i>Should I do it now?</i>

02:58.245 --> 03:02.781
<i>Not yet. Wait until
we get to the checkpoint.</i>

03:02.783 --> 03:04.249
Okay, guys, this is it.

03:04.251 --> 03:06.652
Hey, Ivy league's gun,
put that gun back away.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.354
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need some egghead

03:09.356 --> 03:11.757
who just scored an 81 on his
qual shooting my dick off, okay?

03:11.759 --> 03:13.192
This is my fucking guy!

03:13.194 --> 03:14.593
I'm not just gonna
sit here while you...

03:14.595 --> 03:19.464
Guys, enough! Nate,
just follow our lead, okay?

03:33.780 --> 03:38.350
Is your heart clear?

03:38.352 --> 03:41.220
<i>Are you sure
you want to do this?</i>

03:45.959 --> 03:48.760
The signal
will be better outside.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.339
Here it is.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.561
Did it work?

04:24.331 --> 04:25.597
- Drop it!
- Freeze!

04:25.599 --> 04:28.700
- Hands in the air!
- Turn around!

04:28.702 --> 04:30.836
You have the right
to remain silent.

04:30.838 --> 04:34.473
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.009
You have the right
to an attorney.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.746
<i>Hello, Usman. I can help you.</i>

04:40.748 --> 04:44.750
<i>I can get you phone calls with
your parents, your friends...</i>

04:44.752 --> 04:47.586
<i>My parents?!
I wish they were dead!</i>

04:47.588 --> 04:48.787
<i>And I don't have any friends.</i>

04:48.789 --> 04:51.556
Oh, wow, he's a real prince,
this one.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.426
Can I get in there?

04:56.562 --> 04:58.397
Salam Aleikum.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.710
What the fuck, tom?
I have this room at 4:00!

05:11.712 --> 05:13.445
I know you don't get a lot
of news downstairs, Zamparo,

05:13.447 --> 05:15.814
but we just broke up a massive
terrorist plot, all right?

05:15.816 --> 05:16.982
Try and keep up.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.934
Um...

06:42.936 --> 06:44.569
What? What is it?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.571
Sir, when I flagged up
this guy's email,

06:46.573 --> 06:48.640
I thought the investigation
was only gonna proceed

06:48.642 --> 06:50.742
if there was substantive
criminal evidence to back it up.

06:50.744 --> 06:54.846
We've got hours of him talking about
waging jihad and killing children.

06:54.848 --> 06:58.950
Right, but talking, though, sir,
not... he's not doing anything.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.852
Isn't that the point?

07:11.063 --> 07:13.765
Hey, Tim. How's it going?

07:13.767 --> 07:17.702
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh?

07:18.806 --> 07:23.575
Uh, yeah, actually.
How'd you guess?

07:49.102 --> 07:50.936
Genius, emergency meeting

07:50.938 --> 07:52.170
in the conference room!

07:55.575 --> 07:58.777
The crash was off 301
around 2:00 last night.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.846
Local police
controlled the scene,

08:00.848 --> 08:03.648
so, thankfully,
the press knows nothing.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.852
These containers
carried cesium-137.

08:06.854 --> 08:10.622
It's used for radiotherapy
applications in hospitals,

08:10.624 --> 08:14.926
but it's highly regulated and had
no business being on that truck.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.529
When we tracked the shipment
back to Baltimore,

08:17.531 --> 08:20.866
the customs record showed
eight containers, not two.

08:20.868 --> 08:25.203
So there's six more of them out there,
all of them in the country illegally.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.840
If that quantity made it's way
into a radiological device,

08:28.842 --> 08:31.042
we could be looking at
thousands of casualties,

08:31.044 --> 08:37.115
mass evacuations and radioactive
contamination throughout the D.C. area.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.817
- Tom?
- Yeah.

08:38.818 --> 08:42.721
Uh, lab analysis puts the
cesium coming from north Africa.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.056
So the guys on four,
they put together this map.

08:45.058 --> 08:48.827
It's an analysis of Muslim communities
in DC, Maryland and Virginia,

08:48.829 --> 08:50.729
along with their
countries of origin.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.898
We'd like each... yes?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.866
What about leads
on the DT front?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.636
Well, given the cesium
came from north Africa,

08:57.638 --> 08:59.838
we don't think domestic
is really in the picture.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.708
The last time anyone tried to build a
dirty bomb on us soil was James Cummings.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.911
He was a white supremacist
living in Maine,

09:05.913 --> 09:08.980
he was going to set it off
at Obama's inauguration.

09:08.982 --> 09:13.685
He had uranium, thorium, and he
was trying to acquire cesium.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.620
I'm sure you're familiar
with the case.

09:15.622 --> 09:17.889
It goes without saying,
anyone here is welcome

09:17.891 --> 09:20.625
to pursue any leads
they think are fruitful.

09:34.674 --> 09:35.974
Okay, would you fucking stop...

09:35.976 --> 09:38.176
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.878
- Hi.
- I'm Angela Zamparo.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.246
- Nate foster.
- I know.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.181
You got a couple minutes?

09:44.183 --> 09:47.152
Dt's downstairs.

09:47.154 --> 09:50.188
There's only one perk
to being down in this shithole.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.894
Nicorette just isn't the same.

09:55.896 --> 09:59.898
So, Nate...
You seem like you've got

09:59.900 --> 10:02.100
a bit more going on
than most around here.

10:03.903 --> 10:06.004
You remember Oklahoma city?

10:06.006 --> 10:09.674
Well, yeah,
I guess I was five, but sure.

10:11.077 --> 10:13.011
What do you know
about Timothy McVeigh?

10:13.013 --> 10:18.617
Ah... he was some kind of
lone extremist...

10:18.619 --> 10:19.918
in a militia?

10:19.920 --> 10:22.687
Don't be an asshole
who bullshits questions

10:22.689 --> 10:24.122
you don't know
the answer to. Here.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.726
Timothy McVeigh was a
decorated Gulf war veteran.

10:27.728 --> 10:31.830
He was not insane; He was not a
lunatic; And he was not stupid.

10:31.832 --> 10:35.100
He was a white supremacist,
following a plan.

10:35.102 --> 10:39.137
- What plan?
- A plan from a book called the Turner diaries.

10:39.139 --> 10:44.776
It's about a "race war" to exterminate
blacks, Jews, and "mud people."

10:44.778 --> 10:47.412
You know how the war
gets started?

10:47.414 --> 10:52.751
The hero drives a truck bomb
into a federal building.

10:52.753 --> 10:57.756
Timothy McVeigh was reenacting that
scene from the Turner diaries.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.225
He was carrying the book
with him when he was arrested.

11:00.227 --> 11:03.662
What he was trying to do
was start the race war.

11:05.164 --> 11:09.034
You're focused on
the Islamic guys. I get it.

11:09.036 --> 11:12.437
We all create a narrative based
on what we think is important.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.173
We see what we want to see.

11:16.809 --> 11:19.811
But just because you're not
looking at something...

11:21.180 --> 11:23.248
doesn't mean it's not there.

11:26.085 --> 11:28.887
So, why are you telling me this?

11:35.161 --> 11:41.700
<i>I'm talking about a blood and guts, in
the street, kill or be killed race war.</i>

11:41.702 --> 11:46.237
<i>I have information about a truck
accident outside DC last night,</i>

11:46.239 --> 11:50.775
<i>involving classified
radioactive material.</i>

11:50.777 --> 11:55.380
<i>But now the FBI is trying
to cover it all up. Why?</i>

11:55.382 --> 11:58.249
<i>Because something
big is happening,</i>

11:58.251 --> 12:02.220
<i>and it's bigger than 9/11, and
it's bigger than Oklahoma city.</i>

12:02.222 --> 12:07.058
<i>So be warned,
be armed, and be ready.</i>

12:15.000 --> 12:17.302
His name is Dallas wolf.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.037
He gets 20,000
listeners a night.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.439
We believe he's based
just outside of DC,

12:21.441 --> 12:24.309
but almost nobody
knows him personally.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.846
But I have an informant,
a skinhead in a gang.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.381
And the leader of that gang
is friends with wolf.

12:30.383 --> 12:34.953
So I need someone to get
in there, and get close to him.

12:34.955 --> 12:39.524
Right and I'm trying to tell you
that this is not my thing!

12:39.526 --> 12:42.227
I barely passed the pft!

12:42.229 --> 12:44.329
What do you think
undercover work is?

12:44.331 --> 12:46.231
Beating guys up
and shooting at them?

12:46.233 --> 12:50.802
No, it's people skills.
It's controlling situations.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.438
- It's this.
- Seriously?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.274
This is the only undercover
training you'll ever need.

12:56.276 --> 13:00.311
I saw you with that Muslim kid. You
got most of this going on anyway.

13:00.313 --> 13:04.215
Look, I read your file.
High IQ, great people skills,

13:04.217 --> 13:07.886
but not your typical
FBI profile.

13:10.389 --> 13:15.460
Introverted, an outsider,
unhappy childhood.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.062
Single mother,
always moving around a lot,

13:18.064 --> 13:20.064
always the new kid,
bullied at school,

13:20.066 --> 13:21.232
no close friends or...

13:21.234 --> 13:23.001
Okay, okay, okay, fuck you!

13:23.003 --> 13:24.135
That's... this is an invasion.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.436
What gives
you the right to look...

13:25.438 --> 13:27.305
Because we don't have time
to dick around here!

13:27.307 --> 13:29.507
You don't smuggle a boatload
of cesium into the country

13:29.509 --> 13:30.575
and then just
let it fucking sit there!

13:30.577 --> 13:31.876
Fine, but I'm trying
to tell you,

13:31.878 --> 13:32.944
I don't have
the skills for this!

13:32.946 --> 13:34.145
I can't even defend myself!

13:34.147 --> 13:35.380
You do have the skills,

13:35.382 --> 13:37.348
and they mean you will
never have to!

13:39.285 --> 13:41.452
What did you say to that kid?

13:41.454 --> 13:47.559
"You want to change things, so nobody
has to suffer the way you did."

13:59.839 --> 14:01.472
<i>A dirty bomb
is any kind of crude,</i>

14:01.474 --> 14:04.142
<i>explosive device
that when detonated,</i>

14:04.144 --> 14:07.879
<i>disperses radiation
around and beyond the blast.</i>

14:07.881 --> 14:11.449
<i>What you would do
is irradiate a large territory.</i>

14:11.451 --> 14:14.853
<i>Now some of these things
have a half-life of 30 years.</i>

14:14.855 --> 14:16.955
<i>In many cases,
this material cannot be seen,</i>

14:16.957 --> 14:20.124
<i>it can not be smelled, cannot
be felt, cannot be tasted.</i>

14:20.126 --> 14:22.427
<i>The more technically
capable an adversary is</i>

14:22.429 --> 14:25.096
<i>the more likely
they would be to find ways</i>

14:25.098 --> 14:27.966
<i>to spread the radioactive
material over larger areas.</i>

14:27.968 --> 14:31.169
<i>One of things that we've been
taught in recent years,</i>

14:31.171 --> 14:35.039
<i>is that we must be able to
prepare for the unthinkable.</i>

14:35.041 --> 14:38.309
<i>The terrorists sell smuggling
weapons of mass destruction</i>

14:38.311 --> 14:40.245
<i>into the country
in a shipping container.</i>

14:46.919 --> 14:49.254
<i>An American Hiroshima.</i>

14:50.289 --> 14:53.291
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

14:53.293 --> 14:56.027
Do you know how management
looks at undercover, Nate?

14:56.029 --> 14:57.528
You think this office is bad?

14:57.530 --> 14:58.930
They'll have you
chasing pedophiles

14:58.932 --> 15:00.098
on an Indian reservation.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.432
I just want to discuss
the option, sir.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.934
Discuss the option?

15:02.936 --> 15:05.336
Of what,
of killing your whole career?

15:07.039 --> 15:10.608
<i>In the beginning was the word.</i>

15:10.610 --> 15:14.212
<i>When the word found us,
we were unconscious.</i>

15:15.347 --> 15:19.250
<i>But the word awakened us.</i>

15:19.252 --> 15:21.519
<i>It made us conscious.</i>

15:22.421 --> 15:25.423
<i>Our enemies were everywhere.</i>

15:26.692 --> 15:29.460
<i>Our eyes were opened.</i>

15:29.462 --> 15:33.097
<i>And they were filled with shame.</i>

15:33.099 --> 15:39.570
<i>We have been violated,
betrayed, and humiliated.</i>

15:39.572 --> 15:42.573
<i>For we had
allowed this to happen.</i>

15:42.575 --> 15:48.179
<i>And so the word spoke to us,
and told us to stand up!</i>

15:48.181 --> 15:51.983
<i>To take back
what had been stolen from us!</i>

15:51.985 --> 15:56.587
<i>To fight for race,
soil, and honor!</i>

15:58.691 --> 16:00.992
<i>Do you know what they do
to informants, Nate?</i>

16:00.994 --> 16:02.226
<i>You know what a "necktie" is?</i>

16:02.228 --> 16:03.561
They slit your throat,

16:03.563 --> 16:05.129
and they pull your tongue
right out through it?

16:05.131 --> 16:06.297
Oh, shut the fuck up!

16:06.299 --> 16:07.532
Oh, what, so you
want him to go in blind,

16:07.534 --> 16:08.666
so he has no idea
what he's getting into?

16:08.668 --> 16:10.001
You're just trying
to manipulate him!

16:10.003 --> 16:11.436
And you're not?

16:11.438 --> 16:13.171
You do whatever
the fuck you want.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.573
But you better think
long and hard about this.

16:17.609 --> 16:21.746
<i>The Turner diaries, it's sold
over a half a million copies.</i>

16:21.748 --> 16:23.548
<i>Who do you think is buying it?</i>

16:23.550 --> 16:25.683
<i>Eric Rudolph,
the Olympic bomber,</i>

16:25.685 --> 16:27.685
<i>Wade Paige,
who shot up the Sikh temple.</i>

16:27.687 --> 16:30.588
<i>Larry Ford,
developing typhoid and cholera.</i>

16:30.590 --> 16:32.991
<i>Liam Carr,
with the cyanide bomb,</i>

16:32.993 --> 16:36.427
<i>Anthrax, ricin,
botcillism, c-4, ied's,</i>

16:36.429 --> 16:42.133
<i>I could go on like this for hours. And
all of them are white supremacists.</i>

17:22.407 --> 17:24.342
<i>My name is Nate Thomas.</i>

17:26.045 --> 17:30.782
I was in the marines for three
years, on a WMD squad in Iraq.

17:30.784 --> 17:35.053
But I saw a lot of things
over there that changed me.

17:37.156 --> 17:40.258
And I'm startin' to wonder...

17:40.260 --> 17:41.659
No.

17:47.699 --> 17:49.233
My name is Nate Thomas.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.335
My name is Nate Thomas.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.337
My name is Nate Thomas.

17:54.807 --> 17:58.543
<i>I was in the marines for three
years, on a WMD squad in Iraq.</i>

18:01.613 --> 18:05.083
<i>But I saw a lot of things
over there that changed me.</i>

18:09.555 --> 18:13.124
<i>I started to wonder what was
really going on in this country.</i>

18:22.167 --> 18:28.139
<i>And now I'm back home...
Trying to make a new start.</i>

18:31.844 --> 18:34.846
<i>I'm starting to figure out
the truth about some things.</i>

18:52.798 --> 18:56.467
<i>There's really only a handful of
people who know what's going on.</i>

19:02.508 --> 19:04.542
<i>But I want to be one of them.</i>

19:07.913 --> 19:10.581
And I want to make a difference.

19:11.884 --> 19:16.420
Okay. Not bad. What else?

19:17.890 --> 19:19.190
What's this?

19:19.192 --> 19:20.458
It's my dd-214.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.826
I was up all
night Photoshop-ing it,

19:21.828 --> 19:23.361
so if anyone wants to see proof

19:23.363 --> 19:24.862
of my service in the marines,
they can just...

19:24.864 --> 19:26.164
What the fuck are you doing?

19:26.166 --> 19:28.232
No, no, no, no. Listen to me.

19:28.234 --> 19:32.470
If you get yourself in a situation where
you have to show somebody your dd-214,

19:32.472 --> 19:36.407
then you're already done.
You understand?

19:38.477 --> 19:41.646
Good. Now what else?

19:42.347 --> 19:43.714
<i>Lone extremism</i>

19:43.716 --> 19:47.251
<i>is not a social phenomena,
it's a tactic.</i>

19:47.253 --> 19:49.854
<i>Terrorists call it
leaderless resistance.</i>

19:49.856 --> 19:51.956
<i>The leaders of the movement
provide inspiration,</i>

19:51.958 --> 19:54.759
<i>but they also encourage
hidden cells act independently</i>

19:54.761 --> 19:57.929
<i>like Timothy McVeigh
and Terry Nichols.</i>

20:04.269 --> 20:05.803
Principle #3:

20:05.805 --> 20:08.539
Arouse in the other person
an eager want.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.676
So what do they want from you?

20:11.678 --> 20:14.912
My loyalty? I'm loyal,
I'm dedicated to the the cause.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.916
No. Any thug can be loyal.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.285
What do you have...

20:21.287 --> 20:25.289
What the guys with the
cesium... are gonna want?

20:41.840 --> 20:45.943
Welcome to Medvale medical
supply company.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.513
My military contacts
helped me start this business.

20:49.515 --> 20:52.383
Most of our sales are online.

20:52.385 --> 20:55.386
Our radiotherapy products
are specifically designed

20:55.388 --> 20:58.923
for the handling and storing
of radioactive material.

21:01.260 --> 21:07.565
So we can acquire sensitive
materials and hide them.

21:10.736 --> 21:15.006
<i>His name is frank hedges.
He's been a Ci for two years.</i>

21:15.008 --> 21:17.541
He's in a gang called
the Panzer strikeforce,

21:17.566 --> 21:19.744
and the leader of the
gang is this guy.

21:19.746 --> 21:23.014
Vince Sargent.
He's friends with Dallas wolf.

21:23.016 --> 21:24.749
So Vince and Dallas wolf
are tight?

21:24.751 --> 21:28.519
Yeah, I told you, Vince calls
into wolf's show every week.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.355
<i>So frank brings you
into the gang,</i>

21:31.357 --> 21:35.393
<i>you hang out, get some credibility,
you make these guys like you.</i>

21:35.395 --> 21:40.298
<i>You get close to Vince. Then, you
use him to get to know wolf.</i>

21:40.300 --> 21:42.366
This is my friend Nate
I was telling you about.

21:42.368 --> 21:44.035
Hey, everybody.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.804
14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.740
All right, spread 'em.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.676
Roy does our security.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.512
Okay, fine.

22:02.554 --> 22:04.355
Whoa, whoa, hey,
what the fuck is that?

22:04.357 --> 22:06.957
- What's what?
- That! Under your fucking shirt there!

22:06.959 --> 22:09.360
What is that?
Hey, are you a cop?

22:09.362 --> 22:12.330
Hey, look me in my fucking eyes, boy!
Are you a fucking cop?

22:12.332 --> 22:15.800
- No, I'm not.
- No? Whoo!

22:19.037 --> 22:20.571
He's fine.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.340
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.475
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.

22:27.612 --> 22:29.347
Have a seat.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.625
You drink bud?

22:42.627 --> 22:44.695
Uh, yeah, absolutely.

22:45.697 --> 22:46.997
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.734
Uh, yeah,
three years in the corps.

22:49.736 --> 22:52.937
- You kill anybody?
- Johnny!

22:52.939 --> 22:55.106
He's Johnny. He's a fresh cut.

22:55.108 --> 22:57.074
We're trying to
teach him the ropes.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.509
I know the fuckin' ropes, man.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.578
Yeah, then mind your
fucking manners!

23:02.381 --> 23:05.950
So, did you? Kill anybody?

23:08.053 --> 23:09.453
I don't talk about that.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.523
But what I did see

23:12.525 --> 23:14.425
was a lot of our guys go down.

23:14.427 --> 23:17.828
Good guys... friends.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.930
And for what?

23:21.533 --> 23:24.802
I was on a WMD squad,
the whole reason we were there,

23:24.804 --> 23:27.738
except we didn't find shit,
did we?

23:27.740 --> 23:31.041
Hmm. So then I get home, I started
listening to Dallas wolf.

23:31.043 --> 23:34.078
Oh, yeah?
Dallas and I go way back.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.647
Oh, there's a guy
I'd love to meet, you know.

23:36.649 --> 23:37.948
He's somebody
who's telling the truth.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.484
He's out there,
he's asking why were we there?

23:40.486 --> 23:41.852
And the answer's
always the same.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.721
Iraq, 9/11, Osama bin laden,

23:43.723 --> 23:46.090
what does it all come back to?

23:46.092 --> 23:48.159
Look at every war
we've ever been in.

23:48.161 --> 23:50.594
How many white men slaughtered
their brothers in world war ii?

23:50.596 --> 23:52.963
What, like a 100 million?
And for who?

23:52.965 --> 23:55.099
Who's always
pulling the strings?

23:55.101 --> 23:57.868
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.474
Look at this bottle.

24:04.142 --> 24:06.143
You see anything funny?

24:10.649 --> 24:12.917
You're talking about
the Jew tax?

24:12.919 --> 24:14.685
What's the Jew tax?

24:15.554 --> 24:16.887
Tell 'em, Nate.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.824
Start looking at
the food you buy,

24:19.826 --> 24:21.525
and you'll see this little "u."

24:21.527 --> 24:24.061
The union of orthodox rabbis
gets paid to perform

24:24.063 --> 24:26.030
a "blessing" on everything
in the grocery store.

24:26.032 --> 24:31.502
For this "blessing," they rake
in billions of dollars in taxes.

24:31.504 --> 24:37.041
We can't control the ketchup,
but we can control the streets.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.210
That's how
it went down in Germany.

24:39.212 --> 24:42.613
And we think of ourselves
as a sturm abteilung.

24:42.615 --> 24:45.549
We are
a thinking man's soldiers.

24:45.551 --> 24:47.218
First here.

24:48.119 --> 24:49.887
And then here.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.089
And that is where
the revolution starts.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.858
We're not these
tired old KKK guys,

24:53.860 --> 24:55.960
waiting for some catastrophe
to start a race war.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.729
- We're the catastrophe.
- That's fucking right.

25:03.068 --> 25:06.770
And we need guys like you,
with military backgrounds.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.607
We need best practices
in our security.

25:09.609 --> 25:12.510
Come on, man, I think our
fucking security is pretty good.

25:12.512 --> 25:15.179
Well, always room
to improve, though, right?

25:17.883 --> 25:19.283
Oh, yeah?

25:21.653 --> 25:23.087
Like what?

25:23.089 --> 25:25.956
Well, like, look at
the position of this booth

25:25.958 --> 25:28.692
and then tell me, without looking,
where the nearest exits are.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.194
- What's your point?
- The point is,

25:30.196 --> 25:31.695
of all the large
booths in this restaurant,

25:31.697 --> 25:33.697
you picked the one
farthest from the exits.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.065
If something goes down,
we're fucked.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.635
No, we're ready
for whatever goes down.

25:37.637 --> 25:40.738
Yeah, with only you and him, I don't
know your name yet, I'm sorry, carrying?

25:40.740 --> 25:43.207
Oh, and how the fuck
you think you know that?

25:43.209 --> 25:49.146
When you pat someone down so they're facing
everybody's lap, it's pretty easy to tell.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.749
You spend three years in Iraq,
you learn how to scan a room.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.083
And see threats.

25:53.085 --> 25:56.086
Well,
isn't that fucking impressive.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.556
Now I only got
one question for you.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.624
What?

26:00.626 --> 26:03.260
Why are you wearing Levis?

26:05.864 --> 26:11.802
Levis? Your fucking Jew jeans?

26:11.804 --> 26:13.904
Yeah, no, sorry,
I just couldn't help notice

26:13.906 --> 26:15.205
when I was pattin' you down.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.074
While you were doing
your little detective work

26:17.076 --> 26:19.143
all up in everybody's lap.

26:20.879 --> 26:23.147
So why are you wearing them?

26:25.584 --> 26:27.151
Because when
I got home from Iraq,

26:27.153 --> 26:32.723
my brother gave me these
jeans... as a homecoming gift.

26:32.725 --> 26:35.025
Now, does he understand
the struggle we're in? No.

26:35.027 --> 26:39.196
But I'm sure as shit not gonna let a Zionist
conglomerate keep me from wearing them.

26:40.031 --> 26:42.299
You wanna boycott the Jews?

26:42.301 --> 26:44.134
You ever look at
the fortune 500?

26:44.136 --> 26:46.136
You'll be living
in a fucking cave.

26:58.383 --> 27:04.622
He's right. Shit, they probably
own this place, too.

27:30.015 --> 27:32.750
Frank tells me you run
a medical supply company now?

27:32.752 --> 27:35.653
Yeah. Yeah, my military contacts
helped me set up.

27:35.655 --> 27:38.088
We're just starting out, but we
got access to a lot of stuff.

27:38.090 --> 27:41.291
That's great. I'd love to
talk to you about that sometime.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.160
Yeah... anytime.

27:45.263 --> 27:50.834
You know, when I was 13,
I actually played soccer.

27:50.836 --> 27:54.138
One day, I came into
the locker room, right?

27:54.140 --> 27:56.373
And there were these
six niggers,

27:56.375 --> 28:01.679
and they had this friend of mine, this
Irish kid, down in the stalls, right?

28:01.681 --> 28:05.416
His head was up against the toilet,
and his face was just covered,

28:05.418 --> 28:09.386
I mean, covered in blood,
like flaps of skin.

28:09.388 --> 28:12.923
I'd never seen anyone
get beaten like that.

28:14.359 --> 28:18.796
And when I came in,
they just stared at me.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.966
They stared, and I...

28:26.104 --> 28:31.709
I walked away...
And just left him.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.279
I hated those motherfuckers.

28:38.883 --> 28:43.487
Yeah, when I was your age,
I got pushed around a lot.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.757
- Yeah?
- It fucking sucks.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.392
But you can use that.

28:50.328 --> 28:55.099
Yeah, but with these guys,
nobody can do shit to me.

28:55.934 --> 28:59.970
I learned to be proud. Strong!

28:59.972 --> 29:04.274
- Yeah, but...
- to be an Aryan fucking warrior!

29:04.276 --> 29:05.476
Isn't that right, Johnny?

29:07.246 --> 29:08.812
All right, so what, are we gonna
stand around all night

29:08.814 --> 29:11.181
- or we gonna get fucking drunk!
- Let's go!

29:11.183 --> 29:14.051
Come on, junior, let's get
some fucking beer, motherfucker!

29:14.053 --> 29:16.120
Come on, boy!

29:16.122 --> 29:17.921
Get in there, boy!

29:20.992 --> 29:25.162
Hey, Nate, you know what, man?

29:26.331 --> 29:29.533
Everybody seems to
really fucking like you.

29:31.536 --> 29:33.170
Yeah.

29:49.921 --> 29:52.790
<i>This is my friend Nate
I was telling you about.</i>

29:52.792 --> 29:54.191
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>

29:54.193 --> 29:57.394
<i>14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.</i>

29:57.396 --> 29:59.096
<i>All right, spread 'em!</i>

29:59.098 --> 30:01.098
<i>Roy does our security.</i>

30:02.267 --> 30:06.537
<i>To be an Aryan fucking warrior!</i>

30:06.539 --> 30:08.405
<i>Isn't that right, Johnny?</i>

30:13.411 --> 30:16.547
<i>Something big is happening.</i>

30:20.185 --> 30:22.553
<i>In the beginning was the word.</i>

30:24.322 --> 30:27.558
<i>Be armed and be ready.</i>

30:49.914 --> 30:51.415
- Hey!
- Hey.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.083
What's the matter, man?
You didn't hear me?

30:53.085 --> 30:55.252
I just... uh...

30:55.254 --> 30:56.587
You sleep well?

30:57.222 --> 30:58.555
What's wrong?

31:00.024 --> 31:02.059
Oh, yeah, no,
we know where you live.

31:02.061 --> 31:06.997
- Yup.
- Right. Cool.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.499
Yeah, so, what,
you're not gonna invite us in?

31:10.635 --> 31:11.869
Yeah, come on in.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.438
Oh, thanks, man,
so sweet of you.

31:15.473 --> 31:18.375
It's a mess, sorry.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.545
Welcome.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.114
You mind?

31:27.051 --> 31:28.952
Yeah, it's a cool place, man.

31:28.954 --> 31:33.023
Yeah, but it kind of
looks like you just moved in.

31:36.494 --> 31:39.363
So, what are
you guys doing here?

31:39.365 --> 31:41.899
Aw, don't break my heart.

31:43.001 --> 31:44.501
What are we doing here?

31:44.503 --> 31:47.104
Come on, don't make it sound
like you're not happy to see me.

31:48.506 --> 31:51.575
See Vince is outside. He's got
a little surprise for you.

31:51.577 --> 31:55.245
Oh, hey, well, um...

31:55.247 --> 31:57.014
Yeah, well, I'm ready. Let's go.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.549
You're gonna be psyched, man!
It's fucking awesome!

31:59.551 --> 32:01.084
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.921
Cool, well, I'm good to go.
Let's head out.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.589
- Let's go, Roy.
- What's the rush?

32:07.626 --> 32:09.326
I'm coming.

32:11.529 --> 32:15.399
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?

32:30.549 --> 32:35.118
Goddamn, man, you got some fucking
shitty-ass furniture up in here, huh?

32:35.120 --> 32:37.621
Yep. Cheap as shit.

32:37.623 --> 32:40.023
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

32:40.025 --> 32:41.391
Sieg Heil,
motherfucker, let's go.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.026
Sieg fucking Heil.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.169
<i>You didn't
finish your transcript.</i>

32:52.171 --> 32:55.205
<i>Yeah, I know, I'll get to it.
Look at my fucking arm!</i>

32:55.207 --> 32:56.974
<i>And what the fuck
is going on with this guy Roy?</i>

32:56.976 --> 32:59.509
You make him look small,
you make him into an enemy.

32:59.511 --> 33:02.746
Sometimes, Angela, it would just
be great to hear, "good job."

33:03.648 --> 33:05.015
I'm only so hard on you

33:05.017 --> 33:06.683
because I'm trying
to protect you.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.352
You have to remember
your objective here.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.487
This is about
getting to Dallas wolf.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.255
So what do I do about that?

33:12.257 --> 33:16.426
Try relating to these guys
as human beings. You know?

33:16.428 --> 33:18.462
Open up to them, if you can.

33:18.464 --> 33:21.698
You may have more in common
with them than you think.

33:23.468 --> 33:26.503
Man, why the fuck does
Vince make us come to this shit?

33:26.505 --> 33:29.773
"Good networking, lots of movement
guys." I mean, who gives a fuck?

33:29.775 --> 33:31.375
Well, is Dallas wolf
gonna be here?

33:31.377 --> 33:32.576
Who the fuck knows?

33:32.578 --> 33:35.045
I don't listen to that
talk radio bullshit.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.448
Fuck!

33:41.020 --> 33:44.021
Goddamn. Hey, that looks
good on you, man.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.188
Yeah, thanks.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.323
Um, just go in,

33:46.325 --> 33:48.492
I got another
shirt in the cargo.

34:05.410 --> 34:08.245
Hi, you must be
Vince's friend Nate!

34:08.246 --> 34:10.647
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

34:10.649 --> 34:13.050
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.384
Yeah, of course.

34:14.386 --> 34:17.387
Hey, Nate, I made some cupcakes.

34:17.389 --> 34:21.558
The frosting is a little
messed up, but they taste good.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.427
<i>So, Dallas, we wanted...</i>

34:23.429 --> 34:25.629
Nate!
Come check this out.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.797
<i>Is it true,
this Dallas wolf unity rally</i>

34:27.800 --> 34:30.333
<i>is the largest event
you've hosted in years?</i>

34:30.335 --> 34:32.202
<i>Absolutely.
We've brought together</i>

34:32.204 --> 34:35.438
<i>the biggest white separatist
organizations in the northeast.</i>

34:35.440 --> 34:37.474
<i>And we're also
having a conference,</i>

34:37.476 --> 34:40.444
<i>with some of the world's
preeminent racial scholars.</i>

34:40.446 --> 34:42.212
<i>But let me
get something straight.</i>

34:42.214 --> 34:44.648
<i>You have all your permits,
you have all your licenses,</i>

34:44.650 --> 34:47.684
<i>and yet this AFL,
the anti-fascist league,</i>

34:47.686 --> 34:49.286
<i>John, can we get the graphic?</i>

34:49.288 --> 34:51.420
<i>They're planning on
viciously attacking</i>

34:51.422 --> 34:53.824
<i>peaceful demonstrators
with hockey sticks</i>

34:53.826 --> 34:56.259
<i>and d batteries
and urine balloons.</i>

34:56.261 --> 34:57.828
<i>Not only that.</i>

34:57.830 --> 35:01.832
<i>They're busing in hundreds
of protestors from the DC area.</i>

35:01.834 --> 35:05.569
<i>But all I can say is,
the AFL better be careful.</i>

35:05.571 --> 35:07.804
<i>Because while we come in peace,</i>

35:07.806 --> 35:10.607
<i>we're certainly
not afraid of war.</i>

35:10.609 --> 35:11.775
Fuck.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.477
Yeah.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.612
God, that's the first
I'm hearing about this rally.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.882
I mean, god knows you can't get any real
news on the YI division, but still...

35:18.884 --> 35:20.617
Are you planning
on going, Nathan?

35:20.619 --> 35:23.620
And this is Andrew Blackwell
from the Aryan alliance.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.756
- Hail victory, brother.
- Hail victory.

35:26.758 --> 35:29.693
The Aryan alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.

35:29.695 --> 35:33.430
Well, we're the premiere white nationalist
group in the world, so that's not surprising.

35:33.432 --> 35:36.166
Earnest Walton,
grand dragon, good to meet you.

35:36.168 --> 35:37.400
Good to meet you.

35:37.402 --> 35:38.768
Earnest is with the local Klan.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.837
Yeah, you should stop by
one of our meetings.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.572
- We'd love to have you.
- - Oh, wow.

35:42.574 --> 35:43.907
You should check out
our website, too.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.542
We're always looking for
quality people.

35:45.544 --> 35:49.779
Ah, I don't think Nate's
into all that religious stuff.

35:51.516 --> 35:53.383
Excuse me?

35:54.752 --> 35:57.721
Religious stuff?

35:57.723 --> 36:02.192
I just think Nate is a little
more rational than that.

36:04.595 --> 36:07.364
I'm not sure I know
what you mean by that.

36:09.200 --> 36:13.537
Come on, Nate.
Let's go back and get some food.

36:17.708 --> 36:20.410
Stay away from those faggots.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.679
They got this fucked up religion
where they think the Bible

36:22.681 --> 36:26.516
was written for white men and Aryans
are the lost tribes of Israel.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.218
The Bible.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.353
Jews invented Christianity.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.788
Jews invented
the printing press,

36:31.790 --> 36:33.456
and the Bible is the most
published book in the world.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.724
I mean,
anything seem off to you?

36:34.726 --> 36:36.193
How about the fact
the Romans conquered

36:36.195 --> 36:37.360
every mud race on earth,

36:37.362 --> 36:38.495
and then Christianity
finished them off

36:38.497 --> 36:40.230
in a hundred years?

36:41.432 --> 36:44.434
You gotta know who
to stick with in this movement.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.336
You're with us.

36:47.572 --> 36:49.472
Goddamn it, Vince,
every time we come here,

36:49.474 --> 36:50.840
the whole fuckin' place is dry!

36:50.842 --> 36:54.244
- What the fuck, man?
- It's two hours, be good.

36:55.613 --> 36:59.382
Gerry, there's somebody I want
you to meet. This is Nate.

36:59.384 --> 37:02.419
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.254
Nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.

37:04.256 --> 37:07.424
Make yourself at home. I am
throwing on some veggie burgers.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.725
Thanks for having us.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.494
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.597
- Madeline. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.365
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.866
You want to come
see our tree house?

37:16.868 --> 37:18.668
Uh, yeah, sure,
where are we going?

37:18.670 --> 37:21.538
Oh, right, yeah, there.

37:21.540 --> 37:24.674
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your dad build this?

37:24.676 --> 37:26.476
- I built it!
- You built this?

37:26.478 --> 37:29.279
- But my daddy helped.
- Okay. Wow.

37:29.281 --> 37:32.582
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?

37:32.584 --> 37:34.517
If the mud people come.

37:34.519 --> 37:38.822
Always be ready. Always be
watchful and stick together.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.891
You guys kidnapping my guest?

37:41.893 --> 37:43.960
- Huh? Huh?

37:45.896 --> 37:47.664
This is amazing, man.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.467
Well, I've always been
good with my hands.

37:50.469 --> 37:55.005
And it was just wonderful
to have a project with the kids.

37:55.007 --> 37:57.507
You know how
you spell love, Nate?

37:58.909 --> 38:01.911
T-I-m-e.

38:01.913 --> 38:04.948
Ninety percent of the time
you'll ever spend with your kids

38:04.950 --> 38:07.784
- comes before the age of 12.
- Wow.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.820
Yeah. You been in the movement
long, Nate?

38:10.822 --> 38:14.324
Um, not long. Just since
I got back from Iraq.

38:14.326 --> 38:17.360
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, Vince told me you served.

38:17.362 --> 38:18.828
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

38:20.898 --> 38:24.401
Hey, Nate,
don't take this the wrong way

38:24.403 --> 38:26.836
but you kind of seem
a little mature for a skinhead.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.004
Really?

38:28.006 --> 38:29.039
Yeah.

38:29.041 --> 38:30.940
Yeah, maybe.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.977
I don't know.
Um, what about you?

38:33.979 --> 38:35.845
You seem to know a lot
of people in this movement.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.914
Ah, they probably come
for the free food.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.884
Ah, no.
You have these barbecues often?

38:40.886 --> 38:43.687
Yeah, as much as I can,
yes, you know,

38:43.689 --> 38:47.757
I try to create a positive environment
for everybody in the community,

38:47.759 --> 38:49.726
and a place for us
to come together and be

38:49.728 --> 38:51.728
healthy in body and spirit.

38:51.730 --> 38:54.597
"Fuck you, bitch!" And he
turned around, and he's like...

38:54.599 --> 38:59.035
Guys! Guys!
Language, please. Kids.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.404
Jesus fucking Christ.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.007
It makes me so sad
to see those two.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.109
They gotta clean up their act.

39:06.111 --> 39:09.346
Well, how do you mean?

39:09.348 --> 39:14.050
Well, the cigarettes,
and alcohol, the language.

39:14.052 --> 39:18.922
This is what's happening
to our young Aryan men.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.824
Yeah. To be honest,
now that I met you,

39:20.826 --> 39:23.393
I'm kind of surprised
you invited those guys.

39:23.395 --> 39:25.028
Well, you can't exclude them.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.431
I mean,
they're the next generation.

39:28.433 --> 39:29.966
They need our help.

39:29.968 --> 39:33.436
Need to understand their
heritage, and be proud of it.

39:33.438 --> 39:36.806
That's what it's all about,
isn't it? The children.

39:36.808 --> 39:39.476
What kind of a world
will they grow up in?

39:42.947 --> 39:49.452
Goddamn, man, that was the worst
fucking party on earth.

39:49.454 --> 39:54.958
Jesus Christ, what kind
of bullshit vodka is this, man?

39:54.960 --> 39:57.727
Man, that's the last time
I ever let you pick it out.

39:59.563 --> 40:03.900
Man, look at that shit.

40:03.902 --> 40:07.003
Look at that!
That is just fucking...

40:07.005 --> 40:09.539
God, that is so fucking awful!

40:09.541 --> 40:15.078
Man, look at that, look at that beautiful
Aryan woman and that fucking...

40:15.080 --> 40:17.414
Roy, come on,
let's go the fuck home.

40:17.416 --> 40:20.483
No, no, man, we're gonna
teach these two a lesson.

40:20.485 --> 40:23.086
- No!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

40:23.088 --> 40:27.924
Don't you ever
fucking touch me again.

40:27.926 --> 40:32.796
You hear me?
We're Aryan warriors, right?

40:32.798 --> 40:37.567
That means we got a responsibility to
do something about shit like this.

40:41.939 --> 40:45.942
Hey, you two! You need to
get the fuck out of here!

40:45.944 --> 40:47.110
Hold on, what did you say?

40:47.112 --> 40:48.545
I said, get the fuck out of here

40:48.547 --> 40:50.079
or we're gonna kill you,
you fucking spic!

40:50.081 --> 40:51.614
What the fuck is your problem?

40:51.616 --> 40:52.982
- What's our problem?
- - Yeah.

40:52.984 --> 40:55.819
You come into our country,
you fuck our women.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.987
Yeah, you got some big
fucking balls, huh?

40:57.989 --> 40:59.689
- Put the fucking knife down and calm down, all right, man?
- Oh, my god!

40:59.691 --> 41:00.890
They get the point.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.058
You thought you were
a big man, huh?

41:02.060 --> 41:03.092
He gets it, Roy!
He's fucking shaking.

41:03.094 --> 41:05.161
I thought you were a big man.

41:05.163 --> 41:07.130
- Put the fucking knife down!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

41:07.132 --> 41:09.232
I'll fucking gut you,
you piece of shit!

41:09.234 --> 41:10.733
Now go, fucker!

41:12.037 --> 41:14.938
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit! Fuck, Nate.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.707
Goddamn it!
You're fucking lucky!

41:19.076 --> 41:20.543
What the fuck is your problem?

41:20.545 --> 41:21.744
You fucked the whole thing up!

41:21.746 --> 41:23.046
Yeah, I think they got
the message, Roy!

41:23.048 --> 41:25.782
Got the message?
Are you a fucking idiot?

41:25.784 --> 41:27.116
Man, those two were mine!

41:27.118 --> 41:30.820
And then your dumb
fucking ass decides...

41:30.822 --> 41:34.023
Hang on, wait a minute...
First you tried to stop me,

41:34.025 --> 41:35.258
then you try to scare them off,

41:35.260 --> 41:36.793
and then you set off
that fucking alarm.

41:36.795 --> 41:39.496
That wasn't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?

41:39.498 --> 41:42.732
You wanted them to get away.
What the fuck, Nate?

41:42.734 --> 41:44.167
Huh? I said what the fuck?

41:44.169 --> 41:46.169
Okay, you're goddamn right
I wanted them to get away!

41:46.171 --> 41:48.505
You want to be a soldier,
Roy and not a fucking thug?

41:48.507 --> 41:51.007
Then think! You think about
security cameras, Roy?

41:51.009 --> 41:52.909
You think about the liquor store
we were just in?

41:52.911 --> 41:55.545
You think about the clerk or the
license plates on my fucking truck?

41:55.547 --> 41:57.280
You think about
any of that shit?

41:57.282 --> 41:59.716
Fucking Aryan warrior...

41:59.718 --> 42:02.051
A hundred spics and niggers ain't
worth the life of one white man,

42:02.053 --> 42:03.820
but go ahead,
put us all in prison.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.989
That's how you're gonna
win your race war? Huh?

42:07.525 --> 42:09.726
Fuck!

42:09.728 --> 42:11.728
All right, whatever,
can we just get back on the road

42:11.730 --> 42:13.796
and get the fuck out of here?

42:19.069 --> 42:20.670
Fuck!

42:21.672 --> 42:23.573
<i>I ran those license plates.</i>

42:23.575 --> 42:27.777
<i>An accountant, a school
teacher, a lawyer, fireman,</i>

42:27.779 --> 42:30.580
<i>he's an engineer,
not a criminal record in sight,</i>

42:30.582 --> 42:34.717
<i>but Andrew Blackwell,
he's a different story.</i>

42:34.719 --> 42:35.952
<i>Why is he here?</i>

42:35.954 --> 42:37.820
Uh, he said he was
going to wolf's rally.

42:37.822 --> 42:40.189
He's the national director
of the Aryan alliance.

42:40.191 --> 42:43.126
They're based in Ohio, he wouldn't just
come all this way to be in a rally.

42:43.128 --> 42:44.627
Wait, if wolf
is involved in this,

42:44.629 --> 42:46.296
he can't be
doing it alone, right?

42:46.298 --> 42:48.998
I mean, he'd need help,
and organization.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.303
Exactly, so you need to figure out how
wolf and Blackwell are connected,

42:53.305 --> 42:55.204
and why he's really here.

43:07.651 --> 43:10.053
Vince, good to see you.

43:10.055 --> 43:12.789
Rich, can we
get some literature, please?

43:15.759 --> 43:18.127
- White power.
- White power.

43:42.953 --> 43:45.021
Okay, we're Gettin' ready
to get started here.

43:45.023 --> 43:46.856
Can everyone take a seat?

43:48.058 --> 43:50.226
<i>Most times I'd talked to you,</i>

43:50.228 --> 43:53.363
<i>I focus on our survival,</i>

43:53.365 --> 43:56.766
<i>the terrible struggle
to save our people</i>

43:56.768 --> 44:00.036
<i>before they are lost forever.</i>

44:00.038 --> 44:03.339
<i>But what about the future?</i>

44:03.341 --> 44:05.842
<i>What do we dream of?</i>

44:05.844 --> 44:09.145
<i>What is the world
we wish to build?</i>

44:09.147 --> 44:11.114
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

44:11.116 --> 44:16.119
<i>It will be a world like the one
that shaped our race in Europe.</i>

44:16.121 --> 44:22.091
<i>A world of forests,
mountains, and lakes.</i>

44:22.093 --> 44:26.663
<i>Not a world of concrete,
asphalt, and garbage.</i>

44:27.865 --> 44:32.335
<i>And instead of 300 million
race-less mulattos,</i>

44:32.337 --> 44:34.737
<i>breeding and infesting.</i>

44:34.739 --> 44:40.043
<i>Imagine a continent
of 50 million white Europeans.</i>

44:40.944 --> 44:46.949
<i>Smarter, stronger, healthier,</i>

44:46.951 --> 44:49.285
<i>noble men and women</i>

44:49.287 --> 44:54.791
<i>living and working together
in Harmony and unity.</i>

44:55.793 --> 44:58.928
<i>That's the world I see.</i>

44:58.930 --> 45:01.431
<i>That's what keeps me strong.</i>

45:01.433 --> 45:05.968
<i>That's the nation
we can build... together.</i>

45:13.410 --> 45:17.113
If you take
millions of white people,

45:17.115 --> 45:21.884
and flood every country in Africa
with them, what do they call that?

45:22.753 --> 45:24.320
Genocide.

45:24.322 --> 45:29.859
But what's happening to
every white country on earth?

45:29.861 --> 45:31.928
You've got affirmative action...

45:31.930 --> 45:34.363
that kills white jobs.

45:34.365 --> 45:38.201
Abortion,
that kills white babies.

45:38.203 --> 45:41.804
Gay rights,
that kill white families.

45:41.806 --> 45:45.808
Folks, let me
explain something to you.

45:45.810 --> 45:49.245
"Diversity" is a code word.

45:49.247 --> 45:53.883
And what it means is
white genocide!

46:00.190 --> 46:03.392
So, we'll begin marching at the courthouse.
And after two blocks...

46:03.394 --> 46:06.028
Wait a minute, wait a minute. This
is not the order that we agreed to.

46:06.030 --> 46:08.097
Aryan alliance is supposed to be
heading this march.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.298
Now just a second, Andrew.

46:09.300 --> 46:10.867
You know,
we're at this rally every year,

46:10.869 --> 46:12.468
and we start with
the colonial patriots.

46:12.470 --> 46:14.103
Well, this isn't
"every year," is it?

46:14.105 --> 46:16.072
To be fair, Harris,
maybe we should.

46:16.074 --> 46:17.206
You're a local organization...

46:17.208 --> 46:19.842
Vince, can you
introduce me to Dallas?

46:19.844 --> 46:21.344
"The Klan"?
You're not "the Klan."

46:21.346 --> 46:23.079
Yeah, sure.
Come on, let's go.

46:23.081 --> 46:24.814
You're the "invisible white
knights" of the Ku Klux Klan!

46:24.816 --> 46:27.517
Which is what, the third Klan
group in the DC Metro area?!

46:27.519 --> 46:29.418
Hey, Dallas! Good to see you.

46:31.021 --> 46:33.523
It's... it's Vince,
Vince Sargent?

46:33.525 --> 46:36.359
Right, Vince. Good to see you.

46:36.361 --> 46:38.194
Good to see you.
I want to introduce you

46:38.196 --> 46:39.962
to my good friend,
this is Nate Thomas.

46:39.964 --> 46:41.864
- I'm a huge fan of your show.
- Thank you, sir.

46:41.866 --> 46:44.026
If you'll excuse me. I have to
get ready for the march.

46:53.811 --> 46:58.915
- Uh, Mr. wolf?
- Yes, what is it?

46:58.917 --> 47:00.349
I didn't want to
get into this in front of Vince,

47:00.351 --> 47:02.351
but I'd like to talk to you
about an investment.

47:03.387 --> 47:05.421
- An "investment"?
- Mm-hm.

47:05.423 --> 47:08.558
I represent a few people who are big
fans of yours, and they want to help.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.960
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

47:10.962 --> 47:13.196
They have a number of assets
in the online media space,

47:13.198 --> 47:16.532
and they feel the potential for your show is
being limited by your advertising budget.

47:16.534 --> 47:18.901
They want to help you
penetrate some new markets,

47:18.903 --> 47:22.038
and they see no reason
why you can't go nationwide.

47:23.340 --> 47:27.043
Well, that is great, son.
That is just great.

47:27.045 --> 47:32.081
Here, call this number
and we'll talk.

47:32.083 --> 47:33.883
Okay, great.
That sounds great, Mr. wolf.

47:33.885 --> 47:36.152
- Call me, Dallas.
- Thank you.

47:38.255 --> 47:43.092
Racist scum! Racist scum!

47:50.200 --> 47:54.403
We're here today
because we're proud of our race!

47:55.272 --> 47:57.573
We love our race!

47:57.575 --> 47:59.375
And we're here to say that.

47:59.377 --> 48:01.544
- White power!
- - White power!

48:01.546 --> 48:06.148
The white race
is under attack in this country.

48:06.150 --> 48:08.985
- White rights!
- - White rights!

48:08.987 --> 48:11.087
But nobody seems to give a damn!

48:11.089 --> 48:13.556
- White freedom!
- - White freedom!

48:15.159 --> 48:17.894
- Where's Al Sharpton?
- - Fuckin' rednecks!

48:17.896 --> 48:22.598
Where's Jesse Jackson
to fight for white rights!

48:22.600 --> 48:25.201
- White power!
- - White power!

48:25.203 --> 48:27.169
White equality!

48:27.171 --> 48:30.072
- White pride!
- - White pride!

48:31.508 --> 48:36.913
If you're white, and you are
standing over there...

48:36.915 --> 48:39.348
- White freedom!
- - White freedom!

48:39.350 --> 48:42.518
You're on the wrong side
of that barricade!

48:42.520 --> 48:45.054
- White rights!
- - White rights!

48:45.389 --> 48:47.390
Nate!

48:47.392 --> 48:51.294
Wake up, white people! Wake up!

48:51.296 --> 48:53.963
- White power!
- - White power!

48:53.965 --> 48:59.535
It's morning in America
and there's a new day coming.

48:59.537 --> 49:03.339
- Nate! What are you doing, man?
- Shut the fuck up, nigger!

49:03.341 --> 49:07.276
Come join your race!

49:07.278 --> 49:08.678
That's some fucker
that works in my building.

49:08.680 --> 49:11.314
Come join the white race!

49:11.316 --> 49:13.049
White race!

49:13.051 --> 49:14.717
- White power!
- White power!

49:14.719 --> 49:16.953
- White power!
- White power!

49:16.955 --> 49:18.688
- White power!
- White power!

49:18.690 --> 49:21.023
- White power!
- White power!

49:21.025 --> 49:24.593
Racist scum!
Racist scum! Racist bum!

49:24.595 --> 49:26.228
It's the fucking AFL.

49:26.230 --> 49:28.164
Don't worry, they won't do shit.

49:28.166 --> 49:33.536
Well, well, well, if it isn't
the American fucking losers!

49:35.573 --> 49:37.440
Yeah, fuck you!
Why don't you

49:37.442 --> 49:39.742
come over the fucking barricade,
motherfuckers!

49:39.744 --> 49:41.310
Johnny!

49:44.348 --> 49:46.148
Hey, man,
just fucking stay back, okay?

49:46.150 --> 49:47.683
- Don't fucking do it.
- I gotta help him.

49:47.685 --> 49:50.152
Help him by not getting
the fuck arrested, okay?

49:50.154 --> 49:52.188
- Fucking pussies!
- - White Nazi scum!

49:52.190 --> 49:53.522
Yeah, you know what?
I can do that shit, too.

49:53.524 --> 49:55.591
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
motherfucker!

49:55.593 --> 49:58.327
- Do not engage. Do not engage.
- You think I'm playing around?

49:58.329 --> 50:00.730
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Get your hands off of me!

50:00.732 --> 50:02.164
I'm gonna
kill these motherfuckers!

50:02.166 --> 50:03.499
Stay back!

50:03.501 --> 50:05.568
- White power!
- - White pride!

50:05.570 --> 50:07.470
- White power!
- - White pride!

50:15.112 --> 50:19.215
He hit me in the fucking eye!
It's fucking piss!

50:32.462 --> 50:33.496
Johnny!

50:40.137 --> 50:41.537
Andrew, can you walk?

50:49.613 --> 50:51.747
Get the fuck outta here.

50:52.749 --> 50:54.383
You okay? Everyone okay?

50:54.385 --> 50:56.519
Sorry. Okay.

50:56.521 --> 50:57.720
Stay with us.

50:57.722 --> 50:59.655
I'm getting
you out of here, man.

51:02.492 --> 51:04.293
Go... go right, go right!

51:08.231 --> 51:10.699
Oh, fuck!

51:10.701 --> 51:12.401
- Fuck!
- Fucking...

51:13.438 --> 51:14.770
Holy shit!

51:14.772 --> 51:16.539
We gotta go!
We gotta fucking go!

51:21.311 --> 51:23.512
I can't fucking go anywhere!

51:24.247 --> 51:25.681
Stay down!

51:40.464 --> 51:41.831
Fuck!

51:52.409 --> 51:56.445
No, don't get up.
You need to rest.

51:56.447 --> 52:00.282
I brought you some chamomile tea.
It'll help you relax.

52:00.284 --> 52:01.450
Thank you.

52:01.452 --> 52:03.552
There's our wounded warrior.

52:03.554 --> 52:05.354
How you feeling, buddy?

52:05.356 --> 52:07.156
Yeah, much better.
Thank you, guys.

52:07.158 --> 52:12.128
Ah, no problem.
I'm gonna put some music on.

52:12.130 --> 52:15.164
I brought you Sammy
to keep you company.

52:15.166 --> 52:16.565
Thanks.

52:17.602 --> 52:19.168
Oh, wow.

52:19.170 --> 52:21.137
You like it?

52:21.671 --> 52:23.606
I... I love Brahms.

52:23.608 --> 52:26.275
See, Becky,
I knew he was quality.

52:26.277 --> 52:28.277
I think the fourth
is my favorite.

52:28.279 --> 52:30.646
Yeah, mine, too.
Except maybe the...

52:30.648 --> 52:32.148
The first?

52:32.150 --> 52:33.482
Yeah.

52:33.484 --> 52:35.251
Now listen, if you like Brahms,

52:35.253 --> 52:38.921
I've got this clarinet quintet
that will blow your mind.

52:38.923 --> 52:42.224
They're dead, Gerry. Dead.

52:42.226 --> 52:44.293
I'm gonna find them,
and we're gonna string them up...

52:44.295 --> 52:45.728
Alright, I hear ya. I hear ya.

52:45.730 --> 52:49.765
That's why I avoid the
political stuff. Not my thing.

52:49.767 --> 52:51.367
Besides, I've heard
it can be dangerous.

52:55.505 --> 52:57.173
That was fantastic. Thank you...

52:57.175 --> 52:58.707
I thought you guys
were vegetarians.

52:58.709 --> 53:01.844
Everybody's gotta have a few
vices every now and then.

53:02.847 --> 53:04.180
What's "vices"?

53:04.182 --> 53:06.282
Oh, boy, there we go!

53:06.284 --> 53:09.185
I'm sorry about that,
that's my ride.

53:09.187 --> 53:11.754
Gerry, Becky,
thanks for everything.

53:11.756 --> 53:13.622
Nathan, I don't know
what to say.

53:13.624 --> 53:15.291
I owe you, big time.

53:15.293 --> 53:17.960
Why don't you stop by
the compound some time.

53:17.962 --> 53:21.630
Oh, I'm not really in Ohio that
much, but I'd love to if I ever am.

53:21.632 --> 53:24.200
No, I meant the...
The new one.

53:24.202 --> 53:26.502
- Oh.
- Here in Virginia.

53:26.504 --> 53:29.805
Oh, right, yeah,
please, I'd love to.

53:29.807 --> 53:31.373
- Bye.
- Have a good night.

53:31.375 --> 53:33.642
Bye, Andrew!

53:33.644 --> 53:36.278
Well, listen, you're not
going to believe it,

53:36.280 --> 53:40.716
but when it comes to Tchaikovsky...
Gotta go with Bernstein.

53:40.718 --> 53:42.718
- Leonard Bernstein?
- I know, I know.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.453
Gerry, I hate to
break it to you, man...

53:44.455 --> 53:47.223
I know. Listen, I can't help it,
he's a great conductor.

53:47.225 --> 53:49.892
Jews listen to Wagner,
don't they?

53:54.664 --> 53:57.866
So, Gerry,
if you don't mind my asking,

53:58.835 --> 54:01.604
how did you
end up in the movement?

54:02.672 --> 54:04.974
Listen, for me,
it was the books.

54:04.976 --> 54:08.010
My parents
were practically liberals.

54:08.012 --> 54:10.479
Totally blinded by the Zog.

54:10.481 --> 54:13.949
You know, I always knew
something was wrong;

54:13.951 --> 54:15.985
and I had this anger,

54:15.987 --> 54:20.322
I couldn't put my
finger on it, until...

54:21.625 --> 54:22.758
here.

54:22.760 --> 54:26.595
It all started with this.

54:27.897 --> 54:30.532
I was 13.
Read it in four days.

54:30.534 --> 54:34.637
It explains race,
culture, capitalism

54:34.639 --> 54:37.539
and how democracy
destroyed western civilization.

54:37.541 --> 54:39.842
Democracy:
"Three people form a government.

54:39.844 --> 54:41.977
Then two of them vote to steal
the wealth of the third."

54:41.979 --> 54:43.746
- David Lane, right?
- Mm-hm.

54:43.748 --> 54:46.582
Now here's something
more recent. You'll love this.

54:46.584 --> 54:50.819
This breaks down the entire worldwide
Zionist conspiracy, step by step.

54:50.821 --> 54:52.554
- You can bring it back.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.

54:52.556 --> 54:54.556
Nate, Nate, please.

54:56.326 --> 55:01.063
But that was it? I mean,
it was just books woke you up?

55:01.065 --> 55:02.965
Well, you know,
I had my theories.

55:02.967 --> 55:06.502
And then a three-month engineering
contract opened up in Kenya.

55:06.504 --> 55:09.004
I was young,
I wanted to see the world.

55:09.006 --> 55:13.575
And, uh, Nate, listen,

55:13.577 --> 55:17.980
I got no problem with them having
their own country, everybody should.

55:17.982 --> 55:20.949
But if you go there,
and you see,

55:20.951 --> 55:23.719
they weren't even
living like animals.

55:23.721 --> 55:27.389
You know, animals don't live
in their own feces, do they?

55:28.525 --> 55:30.359
So, if you ever have any doubt

55:30.361 --> 55:33.762
white men created civilization,
just go have a look.

56:06.630 --> 56:07.796
<i>Hey.</i>

56:07.798 --> 56:10.399
<i>So, how was the Brahms?</i>

56:10.401 --> 56:12.968
<i>How do you reason
with someone like that?</i>

56:12.970 --> 56:15.871
<i>How can you ever hope
to change their mind?</i>

56:15.873 --> 56:20.008
<i>Listen, you need to remember why you're
doing this. We're not social workers.</i>

56:20.010 --> 56:22.811
<i>You wanted me to relate
to them as human beings, right?</i>

56:22.813 --> 56:24.680
<i>"Open up to them?" You said.</i>

56:24.682 --> 56:26.749
<i>They weren't even
living like animals.</i>

56:26.751 --> 56:28.450
<i>You want to get a drink?</i>

56:28.452 --> 56:30.552
<i>Where are we gonna go
and get a drink?</i>

56:32.523 --> 56:34.790
This suspect,
he was a fucking nightmare.

56:34.792 --> 56:36.959
He was grabbing my ass,
the whole thing.

56:36.961 --> 56:38.927
And he kept insisting
I go to this club with him,

56:38.929 --> 56:41.497
where I knew he was gonna
make his big move,

56:41.499 --> 56:44.666
but if I didn't go, then, you know,
I could blow my whole cover.

56:44.668 --> 56:46.435
So what did you do?

56:46.437 --> 56:48.904
So we're at a bar,
and I tell him I want oysters.

56:48.906 --> 56:51.740
So I get a dozen,
I start plowing through them.

56:51.742 --> 56:53.409
Then I start acting queasy.

56:53.411 --> 56:55.844
I run to the bathroom,
stick my finger down my throat.

56:55.846 --> 56:57.179
- No way!
- Yeah!

56:57.181 --> 56:59.481
So now there's puke
all over my dress,

56:59.483 --> 57:02.718
I tell him I got sick off the
oysters and take a cab home.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.520
Two days later, he was arrested.

57:04.522 --> 57:07.756
- That is fucking awesome.
- Oh, it was fucked up.

57:07.758 --> 57:10.759
But there was the thrill,
you know? That high.

57:10.761 --> 57:12.995
God, there's nothing like it.

57:12.997 --> 57:15.130
Yeah, so why'd you stop?

57:15.132 --> 57:18.667
It was just...

57:18.669 --> 57:23.138
it's no way to live,
the paranoia, the tension.

57:23.140 --> 57:26.442
And I wanted to spend
more time with my kids.

57:26.444 --> 57:27.676
You got kids?

57:27.678 --> 57:29.211
You don't think
I'm mommy material?

57:29.213 --> 57:30.179
No, no... no.

57:30.181 --> 57:32.881
Yeah, I got two princesses.

57:32.883 --> 57:37.486
Mommy and daddy.
Perfect, little suburban life.

57:39.622 --> 57:43.625
Anyway, I know how lonely
this work can be.

57:43.627 --> 57:45.627
But the case won't go forever.

57:46.629 --> 57:48.096
You can't change
the way people think,

57:48.098 --> 57:51.633
but you are making a difference.

58:12.822 --> 58:15.924
Nathan, good to see you.

58:16.793 --> 58:18.126
Can we get you anything, coffee?

58:18.128 --> 58:19.528
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.

58:19.530 --> 58:20.963
This is a great
set-up you got here.

58:20.965 --> 58:23.632
Yeah, thanks.

58:23.634 --> 58:25.534
All right,
let's give you the tour.

58:26.970 --> 58:28.937
This parcel is actually
pretty small,

58:28.939 --> 58:30.939
but we're purchasing
the one next to it.

58:30.941 --> 58:33.976
Although, citizen's groups
are trying to block us out.

58:33.978 --> 58:35.244
Oh, yeah.
How are you handling that?

58:35.246 --> 58:37.546
Well, we tell them
we're here to stay.

58:37.548 --> 58:39.681
Make no mistake about it.
We show up at their homes,

58:39.683 --> 58:41.617
their businesses,
their churches.

58:41.619 --> 58:43.785
They backed down
pretty quick after that.

58:43.787 --> 58:46.188
So you're moving
the national headquarters?

58:46.190 --> 58:48.924
No, we're keeping
the compound in Ohio,

58:48.926 --> 58:53.829
it's just with everything going on right
now, we needed a stronger presence here.

58:53.831 --> 58:55.130
You know?

58:55.132 --> 58:57.299
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.

59:01.571 --> 59:04.072
It's a little primitive,
but we're working on it.

59:06.309 --> 59:09.011
I'm no marksman, by any means,

59:09.013 --> 59:10.879
but I have some expertise
in range design,

59:10.881 --> 59:12.848
just from training
the Iraqi police.

59:12.850 --> 59:14.950
What's your
danger area template?

59:15.852 --> 59:17.953
To contain your cone of fire.

59:19.088 --> 59:22.658
I mean, how do you control
your overshoot?

59:22.660 --> 59:24.860
Uh...
We haven't gotten to that yet.

59:24.862 --> 59:27.896
Okay, well,
you might want to make sure

59:27.898 --> 59:29.731
it's the kikes and niggers
getting hit and not your guys.

59:29.733 --> 59:32.200
Absolutely.
Maybe if you have time,

59:32.202 --> 59:34.202
- you could talk to the guys about it.
- Yeah, sure,

59:34.204 --> 59:36.939
I need to see what kind of equipment
you've got, but I'm happy to.

59:36.941 --> 59:41.076
Okay. Uh, come on up here.

59:46.215 --> 59:48.984
Right now were just
using this for storage.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.654
- Are those cots?
- Yup.

59:52.656 --> 59:56.692
We'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
And we're gonna need to.

59:58.595 --> 01:00:00.829
I'm not gonna
beat around the bush.

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:03.599
You see the type of
organization we have here,

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:05.734
but we could always
use a man like you, Nathan.

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:09.304
Educated, war veteran,
clean record.

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:12.174
I mean, hell, you don't even
have any parking tickets.

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:15.377
Yeah, we have our contacts

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:17.913
in law enforcement,
local, state, federal,

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:21.283
not to mention military hospitals,
laboratories, you name it.

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:23.785
And so what's
the overall objective here?

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:26.154
I mean, are you just trying
to get the message out, or what?

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:29.191
Get the... get the message out?

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:30.926
To who?

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:33.662
We're not trying to recruit
the public here.

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:36.098
What would we do with them? They're
at home sitting on their asses,

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:39.668
- watching sitcoms
and surfing Facebook.

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:43.105
This is revolutionary activity
we're talking about here.

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:49.745
Look, I'm flattered by
the interest, but, you know,

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:53.782
I've been around the movement awhile now
and a lot of these guys are all talk.

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:56.018
Now for me
to really want to get involved,

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.054
I need to know there's
bigger things going on here.

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:00.889
No offense.

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:05.761
Yeah... none taken.

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:10.966
All right...

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:14.369
Take a look at this.

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:25.947
This is the entire
DC water system.

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:29.885
Plants, pipelines,
the whole deal.

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:32.187
Now, Nathan, the guys
you're hanging out with,

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.856
they're all talk,
because they're punks.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:38.160
They're amateurs. They sit
around drinking beer all day,

01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:42.064
maybe they beat up
a few niggers or each other.

01:01:42.066 --> 01:01:46.368
We got no use for them.
We need men like you.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.823
Can I help you?

01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:10.358
I'm looking for Dallas wolf,
but I must have the wrong house.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.929
Oh, no, he's here. Come in.

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:17.432
Randy! Someone's here!

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.835
Hey, Nate.

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:23.004
The studio's back here.

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:27.943
I'm moving studios right now,
so this is all temporary.

01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:29.911
Oh, no, this is a great setup.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:32.180
Thanks for taking
the time to see me, Dallas.

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:36.251
I just spent the afternoon with
Andrew at the Aryan alliance.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.253
Oh, yeah? Andrew's great.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:40.756
They have
an incredible organization.

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:43.892
Yeah, they seem really
serious about the struggle.

01:02:43.894 --> 01:02:45.494
About doing whatever it takes.

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:48.296
They're true patriots,
those guys.

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:52.467
Well, let me give you
a bit of background on me.

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:55.504
I was in Iraq for three years,
on a WMD squad.

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:59.174
And then when I got back, my military contacts
helped me set up a medical supply company.

01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:04.980
Go to Medvale. Com
if you want to check it out.

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:07.015
V-a-l-e.

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:16.458
Wow, this is great.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:20.128
Yeah, we do it all,
from bandages and syringes

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.497
to X-ray
and radiotherapy equipment.

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:24.266
And with the
highly regulated stuff,

01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:25.834
we can cut through
a lot of the red tape

01:03:25.836 --> 01:03:27.969
and deal directly,
and discreetly.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:31.106
Fantastic, Nate.
Great to know.

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:35.343
So... you'd also mentioned
an investment? For the show?

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:40.115
Yes, I've got an investor lined up who's
very excited about expanding your reach.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:43.518
We're talking advertising,
marketing, bigger servers...

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.289
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:51.259
Well, a lot of my military contacts
don't like to publicize their efforts.

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:56.064
But he'd love for you to put together a
proposal about how you'd expand the show.

01:03:56.066 --> 01:03:58.200
Funny you should mention that.

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:03.605
I've been trying to raise $7,500
to break into the Florida market.

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:06.942
They're ripe right now,
with all the immigration stuff.

01:04:06.944 --> 01:04:09.878
Yeah... yeah, this is great!

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:14.482
So, there's one more thing.

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:16.418
Go ahead, shoot.

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:21.223
The reason he's helping you
is because he feels

01:04:21.225 --> 01:04:27.495
that you are a man of action,
as he is. As I am.

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:30.332
Right, sure.

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:31.533
So for him to move forward,

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:35.003
he needs to know
you're serious about this.

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:42.244
Nate, I've been ready to give my life
for this cause for 20 years now.

01:04:42.246 --> 01:04:45.480
What I need is
the right people behind me.

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:52.487
So you tell your investor that if he
wants action, he's got the right guy.

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:59.628
Um, sorry, Dallas, I've got kind of a long
drive back, you mind if I hit the head?

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:17.479
The whole case
is about to blow wide open!

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:19.481
He's in with wolf,
he's in with the Aryan alliance.

01:05:19.483 --> 01:05:22.450
Yeah, and all we need to keep
wolf on the line is that $7,500!

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:25.086
Let me get this straight. So after
everything we spent on your cover,

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:26.621
even after
the medical supply business,

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:26.621
you want me to ask for $7,500

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:30.458
<i>as an "investment"
in this guy's radio show?</i>

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.660
You're the only one
with a budget right now!

01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:33.395
Oh, yeah,
I'm just flush with cash!

01:05:33.397 --> 01:05:35.163
I'm trying to run
a 40-man investigation

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:37.032
<i>on top of all the shit
I've already got!</i>

01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:40.502
Sir, the alliance is building
a compound outside DC.

01:05:40.504 --> 01:05:42.437
Wolf's house is setting off
a Geiger counter!

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:44.539
I spent six hours last night
reading your transcripts,

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:45.507
Nate, you don't have shit!

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:47.509
<i>You don't have shit!</i>

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:51.947
Look at how much carbon
is built up on this bolt.

01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:54.115
- See? See that? Like...
- Yeah.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:56.017
That's unacceptable. When's the
last time you cleaned this?

01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:57.419
I've been meaning
to get to most of them.

01:05:57.421 --> 01:06:00.221
Okay, guys, seriously!
Okay, so we got an Ar-15,

01:06:00.223 --> 01:06:06.361
serial number a00724, needs a new
buffer spring. Come on, guys, let's go!

01:06:06.363 --> 01:06:09.164
We need to go through the whole inventory.
Andrew's waiting on this.

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:12.434
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew, the only way
it's gonna change is with new policies.

01:06:12.436 --> 01:06:14.636
And how do I know it's
not me you're trying to fuck?

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:16.037
Fuck you, you calling us liars?

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:17.205
You get on the phone yourself!

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:19.374
Call them up and ask them...

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:23.311
Hey, guys...

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:26.514
Hey, Nate...
It's been a while.

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:29.985
Yeah, you kinda
disappeared on us.

01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:34.022
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
I've been kind of busy.

01:06:34.024 --> 01:06:35.991
Yeah, I bet you have.

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:39.661
Seems like you made a bunch of
new friends around here, huh?

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:41.563
See, we were just wondering
if maybe you could explain...

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:43.031
Roy!

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.337
Thanks for stopping by.

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:54.109
Be seeing you, Nate.

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:07.722
What was that all about?

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:11.226
Roy says the police
have been following him.

01:07:11.228 --> 01:07:13.728
He's paranoid
about infiltrators.

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.564
Infiltrators, huh?

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:18.166
Yeah.

01:07:18.168 --> 01:07:22.237
Mm. That's why the police
are on his ass?

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:24.639
Have you seen
how that guy behaves?

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:27.275
It's a miracle
he's not in jail already.

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:34.349
Right, uh, you want to
help us with something?

01:07:34.351 --> 01:07:36.217
Sure, what's up?

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:38.520
I'm throwing a youth event
for Hitler's birthday.

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:41.222
There's a campground
a couple miles from here.

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:44.793
- Help us scout it.
- Sounds good.

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:50.598
It's amazing how much land
there is right outside DC.

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:58.440
Let me ask you something,
Nathan.

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:02.477
What's your opinion
on infiltration?

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.448
Well, how do you mean?

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:09.451
How do we prevent it?

01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:11.653
Well, it's tough.

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:15.190
For one thing, you gotta keep guys with
rap sheets out of important positions.

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:19.227
That's... that's how
they flip most people.

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:22.162
We have a polygraph
back at the compound.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:27.635
Maybe we should
make everybody take it.

01:08:29.404 --> 01:08:30.705
I mean,
I think someone who's trained

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:33.241
can beat a polygraph
without blinking.

01:08:35.176 --> 01:08:42.183
Yeah, maybe we should just do a
background checks for everybody.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:45.520
Get everyone's records
and documents together?

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:48.189
Yeah, I mean, for informants,
that might work.

01:08:48.191 --> 01:08:51.559
But for law enforcement, they
just forge whatever they need.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:58.166
Yeah, but with a few phone calls, you
know, a cover only runs so deep.

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:01.435
Do you suspect someone?

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:07.341
You know, it's like they say
at these rallies.

01:09:07.344 --> 01:09:12.613
You look to the left, look to the
right, one of these people is a snitch.

01:09:19.721 --> 01:09:21.589
It's the left.

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:26.560
Turn left right up here.

01:10:11.607 --> 01:10:13.541
You okay there, Nate?

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:19.647
You look a little off?

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.918
No, I'm good.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.389
Just, uh, tired...
Been a long day.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.564
Well, I think this is a great
location. What do you think?

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:39.500
Yeah, I like it.

01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:42.537
Uh, well, what about
the permits, though?

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:46.407
We tell them we're
a Christian organization,

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:47.875
holding a youth event.

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:56.251
I gotta ask you something.

01:10:57.419 --> 01:11:00.688
Roy said he contacted the NPRC.

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:06.294
Said there's no record of you
having served in the marines.

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:14.035
You mean Roy
went and filed a 180

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:19.974
with a government that he
fucking hates, just to... okay.

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:22.977
I was on a WMD squad,
so that's black ops.

01:11:22.979 --> 01:11:25.313
And he knows that, the fucker.

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:30.551
Wait, hold on, are you guys
taking this seriously?

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:32.754
Is that what that
was all about in the truck?

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:34.589
Because, I understand you have to
do your due diligence or whatever,

01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:35.957
but that's a fucking
serious accusation!

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:37.558
I don't need to take
that shit from anybody!

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.394
- Hey... hey, hey!
- Least of all from...

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:45.400
Okay.

01:11:49.538 --> 01:11:51.406
Let's get out of here.

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:02.517
<i>Nate, listen. We need to get the
serial numbers first, and then...</i>

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:03.951
No, look, I don't have
time for that!

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:06.954
What if he wasn't convinced?
What if he calls wolf?

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:09.023
The account name
is Nate foster, please.

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:10.725
You don't know
if he was convinced!

01:12:10.727 --> 01:12:14.028
You don't even know if they
talk, okay? You're being...

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:16.664
Yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.937
You're a man of your word,

01:12:22.939 --> 01:12:27.075
which is a rare thing
in this movement.

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:30.845
So, listen, Dallas,
my investor is very excited,

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:36.617
but he wants to know some more about
what you're planning, some details.

01:12:36.619 --> 01:12:39.487
Oh, okay, I think it was
all in the presentation,

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:43.725
but we start with online in Tampa,
and then we move down the...

01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:48.363
- No, no, I mean, beyond that.
- Beyond Florida?

01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:52.066
Beyond the show,
like what we talked about.

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:56.871
The actions we're gonna take.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:13:00.675
I'm sorry, Nate. I lost you.
What do you mean?

01:13:00.677 --> 01:13:07.615
What I mean is, you have been talking a lot
about a lot of big things that are coming.

01:13:07.617 --> 01:13:09.684
Bigger than Oklahoma city,
bigger than 9/11...

01:13:09.686 --> 01:13:11.552
Oh, yeah, for sure.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:14.589
Which is why expanding
the show is so important.

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:18.626
Right, and I have been spending a lot of
time with Andrew at the Aryan alliance.

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:21.062
He told me
you'd been working together.

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:25.767
Well, yeah, sure,
I mean, he came to the rally.

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:29.971
No, no, what my investor
needs to know is what are

01:13:29.973 --> 01:13:34.409
the concrete steps that you are
taking to start the race war.

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:36.477
As I said to you before,

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:38.780
I have the expertise,
the connections, the tools.

01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:42.083
Maybe there's some kind
of misunderstanding.

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:45.052
I thought we were talking about
expanding the show.

01:13:45.054 --> 01:13:47.822
Yeah, which my investor
is happy to do,

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:50.191
but if you're not willing to be honest
about the other actions you're taking,

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:53.161
then he's not gonna
be able to support you.

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:59.167
Okay, Nate, fair enough.

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:05.473
Sorry it didn't work out.

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:17.685
I saw the plans, Dallas,
for the water system.

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:22.623
Andrew showed them to me, okay?

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:26.494
So, I know all about it,
and now I just need you

01:14:26.496 --> 01:14:30.231
to stop pretending
and be honest with me.

01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:37.705
This is private property.

01:14:37.707 --> 01:14:41.609
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:44.812
Come on, Dallas.
I'm on your side.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:48.149
Get the fuck out. Now.

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.563
Fuck.

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:03.698
<i>We're going to the office,</i>

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.500
<i>Dallas wolf is there.</i>

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:06.567
<i>You brought him in?</i>

01:15:06.569 --> 01:15:09.036
<i>No. He came to us.</i>

01:15:11.241 --> 01:15:15.076
Sir.
I didn't know you'd be here.

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:19.614
Has anyone talked to him?

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:22.016
No, no, of course not.
No, it's your show.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:26.153
So, Dallas. Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:29.590
You can call me whatever
you like, agent Zamparo.

01:15:29.592 --> 01:15:31.826
Any reason you're using
an assumed name?

01:15:31.828 --> 01:15:33.928
I'm a public entertainer.

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:35.763
Ah... fine.

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:37.298
So, tell me
why you're here today.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.601
I'm here because of
the guy I called about.

01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:43.704
He shows up at my conference,
talking about investing in my show.

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:47.642
<i>But then, he's telling me how he
can get highly regulated items.</i>

01:15:47.644 --> 01:15:51.746
<i>And talking about plans to the
water system, and threatening me!</i>

01:15:51.748 --> 01:15:54.615
<i>His name is Nate Thomas,
and if he does anything crazy,</i>

01:15:54.617 --> 01:15:56.250
<i>I don't want to be
associated with it.</i>

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.986
Hm. Did he give you money?

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:00.688
- He tried to.
- How much?

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:03.324
- $7,500.
- Wow. That's a lot.

01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:05.960
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a wacko!

01:16:05.962 --> 01:16:07.895
<i>A lot of these
nut jobs approach me.</i>

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:09.764
<i>But this guy
is on another level.</i>

01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:13.701
<i>So you have no idea
why you, of all people,</i>

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.736
<i>would be approached by this guy?</i>

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:18.072
<i>No, agent Zamparo, I don't.</i>

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:23.711
Right. Let me play you
something, okay, Randy.

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:25.947
<i>I have information
about a truck accident</i>

01:16:25.949 --> 01:16:32.153
<i>outside DC last night, involving
classified radioactive material,</i>

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:37.058
<i>but now the FBI is trying
to cover it all up. Why?</i>

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.260
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:42.363
It's a radio show.
It's entertainment!

01:16:42.365 --> 01:16:46.167
So you think it's entertaining to
predict and incite terrorist attacks?

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:48.769
Whether I think it's
entertaining is irrelevant.

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:50.338
Why don't you talk to
somebody around here

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:53.274
who knows something about
the law, preferably a man!

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:59.113
<i>Brandenburg vs. Ohio, 1969, it is
not illegal to advocate violence.</i>

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:03.117
<i>The first amendment doesn't protect people
who have knowledge of an actual crime!</i>

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.653
What knowledge
of a crime do I have?

01:17:05.655 --> 01:17:07.388
Well, why don't you tell me,
Randy? What is this accident?

01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:09.390
What is this FBI cover-up?

01:17:09.392 --> 01:17:11.959
Why are you living
at an unregistered address?

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:15.830
And why is that location
lighting up a Geiger counter?

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:22.903
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?

01:17:22.905 --> 01:17:24.905
Why don't you
answer my questions?

01:17:24.907 --> 01:17:28.175
<i>Let me show you something.
Do you mind?</i>

01:17:28.177 --> 01:17:29.977
<i>Help yourself.</i>

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:36.684
<i>From the white action network
blog, aryanmother88 writes,</i>

01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:38.986
<i>"I was driving down
301 last night,</i>

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:42.657
<i>and the FBI had cordoned off
an accident with Hazmat tape.</i>

01:17:42.659 --> 01:17:45.259
<i>I haven't seen anything
on the news.</i>

01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:47.261
<i>So what is the Zog
covering up?"</i>

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:51.365
<i>As for the unregistered
address, I live with my mom,</i>

01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:54.835
<i>and I'd like to keep that
private, if it's okay with you?</i>

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:59.240
<i>And your Geiger counter is lighting
up because I have prostate cancer!</i>

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:02.143
<i>I know your type.</i>

01:18:02.145 --> 01:18:05.980
You think you've got it all figured
out, and you don't know shit.

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:11.018
I'm an entertainer. I do
this for money, and for fun.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:17.058
<i>And I don't give a fuck about Zog or
the race war or any of that shit.</i>

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:21.796
<i>I tell these jackasses what they want
to hear, and they worship me for it.</i>

01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:25.199
<i>So fuck you, agent Zamparo.</i>

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:29.036
<i>Can you open the door, please?</i>

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:39.714
- Now, tom, look...
- Now, tom, look, what?

01:18:39.716 --> 01:18:41.949
Really, what could you
possibly have to say?

01:18:41.951 --> 01:18:43.818
Because this is
a fucking disaster!

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:46.887
I warned you,
I tried to tell you.

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:49.924
- We still might have a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.

01:18:49.926 --> 01:18:52.993
Every single one of those guns is
legally registered. Every one!

01:18:52.995 --> 01:18:55.129
Okay, so you think there's
nothing to any of this? Right?

01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:57.732
The prepaid cellphones?
The barracks for 200 guys?

01:18:57.734 --> 01:19:00.434
- The water system plans?
- They're conspiracy theorists!

01:19:00.436 --> 01:19:04.138
It's all talk!
He keeps those plans around

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.774
to trot out when he wants
to act like a big shot!

01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:09.410
What are they gonna do, they're gonna put
radioactive material in the water supply?

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:11.245
That doesn't make
any fucking sense!

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:14.215
You two, you pull this from here
and that from there,

01:19:14.217 --> 01:19:17.451
and you're making up this whole big fucking
story in your head, and it's bullshit!

01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:19.220
You know,
we see what we want to see!

01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:20.788
Well,
now you've compromised him,

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:22.156
and you've compromised
the bureau,

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:24.425
and you've wasted
all our fucking time!

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.774
This happens sometimes,
you know?

01:19:39.776 --> 01:19:43.177
- I mean, it sucks, but...
- "this happens"?

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:49.216
Is that all you're gonna fucking
say after we find out all of this?

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:51.952
Everything you fucking put me
through has been for nothing?

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:53.988
It's the nature of the work.

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:57.525
No! This... this happened
because of your pet theory!

01:19:57.527 --> 01:19:59.860
And like an idiot,
I went along with it!

01:19:59.862 --> 01:20:01.362
"Oh, yeah, she's an expert,"
I thought.

01:20:01.364 --> 01:20:02.963
"She knows what she's doing!"

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.267
I'm sorry, Nate.

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:08.903
Fucking why?
Why are you even sorry?

01:20:08.905 --> 01:20:10.871
This has been great for you!
You got the thrill back!

01:20:10.873 --> 01:20:12.339
You got the excitement
you've been wanting,

01:20:12.341 --> 01:20:14.308
you got an escape from
your little suburban life,

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:16.177
- by manipulating me!
- No, that is not fair!

01:20:16.179 --> 01:20:18.279
I thought we had a case!

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:23.551
God, do you even know how many
dead ends I've been down?

01:20:23.553 --> 01:20:25.252
No, you fucking knew!

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:27.121
You knew I was so eager,

01:20:27.123 --> 01:20:29.023
so desperate
to do something meaningful,

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:31.358
to actually work on
a real case in this place,

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.927
that I would do
anything you wanted,

01:20:32.929 --> 01:20:35.196
while you just sat back
and enjoyed the ride!

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:42.269
Yeah. Fuck!

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:26.380
Nate!

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:29.950
Hey, good to see you!
I've been calling you!

01:21:29.952 --> 01:21:32.620
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about
that, I've been really busy.

01:21:32.622 --> 01:21:35.022
I just wanted to return these.

01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:37.625
I'm heading out of town
for a couple of months,

01:21:37.627 --> 01:21:40.661
gonna work on setting up
the business on the west coast.

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:43.564
Oh, wow, wow,
well, please come in.

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:47.034
Uh, that's nice of you,
but I don't think I can.

01:21:47.036 --> 01:21:50.170
Aw, come on,
just for a cup of tea?

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:17.531
Is everything okay, Nate?

01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:21.368
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:25.706
Well, you said
you're headed out west.

01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:30.210
Yeah, I'm gonna work on setting up
the business on the west coast.

01:22:30.212 --> 01:22:31.612
Right.

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:36.283
God, it's hard to find
what we're looking for in life.

01:22:37.385 --> 01:22:40.154
But then, I listen
to something like that.

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:45.459
One man made something...
That will make millions,

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:48.162
maybe billions of people
feel the way we just did.

01:22:48.164 --> 01:22:51.665
We all have that power, Nate.
All of us.

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:56.103
Honestly... I used to
feel that way, Gerry.

01:22:57.205 --> 01:23:00.407
I always felt like
I could change the world.

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:05.479
You know, I could right wrongs,
you know, fight injustice.

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:09.750
Nate, listen, it's guys like us that
feel these things the most. Idealists.

01:23:09.752 --> 01:23:12.486
Yeah, I just keep
thinking about that quote.

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:18.225
"For evil to triumph, it only
takes good men to do nothing."

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:23.564
But how? You know, fucking how?

01:23:23.566 --> 01:23:26.667
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gerry,
I shouldn't be...

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:28.635
- It's all right.
- I'm just really tired.

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:41.281
You know, Nate,

01:23:41.283 --> 01:23:43.584
maybe you're
going about this the wrong way.

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:48.789
The rallies, the speeches,
the politics...

01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:51.392
That's not how
the change is gonna come.

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:57.264
It's gonna come from
the unknown soldiers,

01:23:57.266 --> 01:23:59.433
from the leaderless resistance.

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:05.439
How do you mean?

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.044
Let's go out back.

01:24:10.046 --> 01:24:12.646
I made some improvements
to the tree house.

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:22.823
Talking frankly is something we
have to be very careful about.

01:24:22.825 --> 01:24:25.692
- Something we always do outdoors.
- Right, of course.

01:24:25.694 --> 01:24:29.463
You know, I've thinking about this
for a long time, Nate, years really.

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:33.567
What's needed is an event.

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:36.503
What kind of event?

01:24:36.505 --> 01:24:40.174
An event that wakes people up.

01:24:40.176 --> 01:24:42.309
They're sleepwalkers out there.

01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:45.112
They're blind.
Think about this regime.

01:24:45.114 --> 01:24:47.848
Media brainwashing,
secret courts,

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:51.485
mass surveillance,
Waco, Ruby Ridge.

01:24:51.487 --> 01:24:55.622
Using Katrina and 9/11 to set up
"refugee camps," or "detention camps",

01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:57.724
in other words,
concentration camps,

01:24:57.726 --> 01:25:01.161
because who cares about
the rights of a few Arabs,

01:25:01.163 --> 01:25:03.630
niggers and racists,
if it makes us safer?

01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:05.732
Right? That's how it all starts.

01:25:05.734 --> 01:25:11.839
All the lies that the Zionists
tell about Nazi Germany,

01:25:11.841 --> 01:25:15.642
that's what's
actually happening right now!

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:19.580
The irony of it!
Right?

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.221
That's why we gotta be smart.

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:29.690
That's why the event

01:25:29.692 --> 01:25:33.527
has to force the Zog
to show its hand.

01:25:33.529 --> 01:25:36.864
It's gotta reveal the men
behind the curtain.

01:25:36.866 --> 01:25:38.599
Because it's not the event
that wakes people up,

01:25:38.601 --> 01:25:39.733
it's the reaction to the event.

01:25:39.735 --> 01:25:41.869
Yes! Yes, you get it!

01:25:41.871 --> 01:25:43.637
Yeah, look at the sons
of Liberty. Look at the Ira.

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:45.272
That is how
you start a revolution.

01:25:45.274 --> 01:25:48.709
Yeah, yeah, I always felt
this kinship with you, Nate.

01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:51.712
And... I wanted to talk
openly with you,

01:25:51.714 --> 01:25:53.413
but I just haven't
known you that long,

01:25:53.415 --> 01:25:56.583
but I know in my heart,
I can trust you.

01:25:56.585 --> 01:25:59.786
You can. You can, Gerry,
I want to help.

01:25:59.788 --> 01:26:01.822
I want to make a difference.

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:04.725
Okay.

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:09.563
I still got connections
from my Africa days.

01:26:09.565 --> 01:26:15.169
Okay, and we have the means
to create that kind of event.

01:26:15.171 --> 01:26:17.604
But, Nate,
if you get involved...

01:26:17.606 --> 01:26:20.874
we may not live to see
the world we're building.

01:26:20.876 --> 01:26:22.809
But I'll have
helped to build it.

01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:25.946
A man's body dies,
but his deeds live forever.

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:32.920
There's a way you can help us.

01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:37.558
- Okay, yeah.
- Come here.

01:26:57.979 --> 01:27:00.581
We need to talk
to the s.A.C., now!

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:04.851
Oh, my lord,
who the hell wrapped it?

01:27:04.853 --> 01:27:07.487
You guys aren't trying
to give it a bath!

01:27:08.356 --> 01:27:10.257
Oh, hey, guys!

01:27:10.259 --> 01:27:12.759
Sorry abut that, just having some
technical difficulties over here.

01:27:12.761 --> 01:27:14.628
- No problem!
- Be right over...

01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:16.830
- Okay, one, two...
- Hey, Morgan, David...

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:21.235
I want you
to meet somebody. This is Nate.

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.337
Morgan, good to meet you.

01:27:23.339 --> 01:27:25.439
- Greetings, sir. I'm David.
- Hey, you guys.

01:27:25.441 --> 01:27:26.840
So is the wedding out here?

01:27:26.842 --> 01:27:29.610
Yeah, it's right over here.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:27:29.612 --> 01:27:31.478
Wait till we see it all lit up.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.314
Pure of spirit and pure of race,

01:27:34.316 --> 01:27:37.684
these two souls commit
themselves to the defense

01:27:37.686 --> 01:27:41.355
and prosperity
of their sacred blood.

01:27:41.357 --> 01:27:44.992
May their sons and daughters
fill this land,

01:27:44.994 --> 01:27:50.931
forever honoring their duty to
folk, kindred, soil, and honor.

01:27:50.933 --> 01:27:53.533
<i>I know you guys
don't know Nate that well.</i>

01:27:53.535 --> 01:27:56.003
But he's a good man
and he's a good soldier.

01:27:56.005 --> 01:27:58.672
If you trust me,
you can trust him.

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:02.676
No luck yet.

01:28:02.678 --> 01:28:05.479
No one wants to sell
to an anonymous buyer.

01:28:05.481 --> 01:28:09.316
If we give up that prepaid phone
crap, I use my real name,

01:28:09.318 --> 01:28:12.886
I got three guys I can get it from right
now. If we do it the morning of...

01:28:12.888 --> 01:28:15.555
Yeah, I thought we were at least trying
to do this without getting caught?

01:28:15.557 --> 01:28:20.761
Guys, guys, shh. Nate has
a potential solution for us.

01:28:20.763 --> 01:28:24.398
Tatp. It's much better
than ammonium nitrate anyway.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.533
A smaller quantity will
give you a much bigger blast.

01:28:26.535 --> 01:28:29.469
Yeah, well, sure,
but where are we gonna get that?

01:28:29.471 --> 01:28:30.871
I run a medical supply company.

01:28:30.873 --> 01:28:32.773
And you're gonna get tatp?

01:28:32.775 --> 01:28:34.741
I know it's not
the easiest thing,

01:28:34.743 --> 01:28:36.343
but I've got some connections.

01:28:36.345 --> 01:28:38.612
I can make a few calls
and loop back with Gerry.

01:28:38.614 --> 01:28:43.850
Assuming I can, what are we gonna
do about the cesium powder itself?

01:28:43.852 --> 01:28:45.052
Ready when we need it.

01:28:45.054 --> 01:28:46.887
No, I mean, how are we
going to handle it?

01:28:46.889 --> 01:28:49.489
Well we've got heavy gloves,
and we've got goggles.

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:52.592
No... radioactive particles
will pass through those

01:28:52.594 --> 01:28:54.861
as easy as anything else,
including your skin.

01:28:54.863 --> 01:28:57.397
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I think we need suits.

01:28:57.399 --> 01:28:59.533
They'll be pretty bulky,
but we only need to wear them

01:28:59.535 --> 01:29:01.401
when the powder's
out in the open.

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:04.104
When do we need them by?

01:29:04.106 --> 01:29:06.106
Well, we've just been
waiting for the explosive.

01:29:06.108 --> 01:29:10.444
If you can get the tatp,
Sunday is our day.

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:16.650
You guys remember
Timothy McVeigh's last words?

01:29:16.652 --> 01:29:18.885
Yeah, he read <i> invictus.</i>

01:29:20.488 --> 01:29:24.725
"It matters not
how strait the gait,

01:29:24.727 --> 01:29:27.728
how charged
with punishments the scroll,

01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:34.735
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul."

01:29:40.609 --> 01:29:42.876
Are you sure
this is gonna look right?

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:45.946
Wow. It looks great.

01:29:45.948 --> 01:29:48.615
The secret is the smell.
Where's the bleach powder?

01:29:48.617 --> 01:29:50.117
Oh, it's right over here.

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:55.589
And you're sure they're not
gonna try and test this somehow?

01:29:55.591 --> 01:29:57.657
Yeah, that's why
terrorists love tatp.

01:29:57.659 --> 01:29:59.793
You can't identify it
without a mass spectrometer.

01:29:59.795 --> 01:30:01.128
Okay, if you say so.

01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:04.097
Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah,
I'm here now.

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:09.503
Sunday, so team's in place
Friday night.

01:30:09.505 --> 01:30:10.804
Look, can I just say

01:30:10.806 --> 01:30:13.006
I'm sorry about what
I said to you the other day.

01:30:13.008 --> 01:30:15.041
I was exhausted.

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:18.512
Don't worry about it.

01:30:18.514 --> 01:30:20.147
That's what this job
does to you.

01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:21.815
Keep at it another ten years

01:30:21.817 --> 01:30:26.052
and you'll turn into
a real asshole... like me.

01:30:29.757 --> 01:30:31.191
It's totally secure.

01:30:31.193 --> 01:30:33.760
We can keep everything in here,
and then, on game day,

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:36.563
we can use this space
to put it all together.

01:30:36.565 --> 01:30:39.633
Great, great.
This is great, Nate.

01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:43.570
And here is...

01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:47.140
the tatp.

01:30:47.142 --> 01:30:52.579
- No problems, inquiries?
- Nope. All good.

01:30:56.584 --> 01:30:58.618
Morgan's a pharmacist.

01:31:00.888 --> 01:31:02.823
All right.

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:11.898
Hm, these crystals
seem a little small.

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:15.569
Smells about right.
Okay, let's test it.

01:31:15.571 --> 01:31:19.072
Test it? You got a mass
spectrometer in your bag?

01:31:19.074 --> 01:31:20.740
No, we'll just see if it burns.

01:31:20.742 --> 01:31:22.843
What? No, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, what do you mean?

01:31:22.845 --> 01:31:24.711
Burn it?
What are you talking about?

01:31:24.713 --> 01:31:28.014
Well, we use a sample,
we set it a light.

01:31:28.016 --> 01:31:30.851
It burns for a while before it explodes.
I saw it on YouTube.

01:31:30.853 --> 01:31:33.119
Are you insane? Do you know
how dangerous this stuff is?

01:31:33.121 --> 01:31:34.855
Hey, you are not
the only one with experience!

01:31:34.857 --> 01:31:36.890
This is a highly
unstable substance, okay?

01:31:36.892 --> 01:31:38.825
It's sensitive
to heat, friction...

01:31:38.827 --> 01:31:40.727
Which is why
I'll do the test carefully!

01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:42.963
Now you want to see the video?
Because I have it here on my phone!

01:31:42.965 --> 01:31:44.564
I don't give a shit
about what's on your phone!

01:31:44.566 --> 01:31:46.233
We are not
lighting this stuff on fire!

01:31:46.235 --> 01:31:48.969
You know how many bomb techs
I saw get their faces blown off

01:31:48.971 --> 01:31:50.504
trying to deal
with this stuff in Iraq?

01:31:50.506 --> 01:31:52.572
I've worked with this company
for two years!

01:31:52.574 --> 01:31:54.841
They are not gonna send me a
container full of baking soda, okay?

01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:57.677
Gerry, this doesn't work for me, okay, if
he doesn't trust me, or my suppliers...

01:31:57.679 --> 01:31:59.613
We need to test
the fucking stuff!

01:31:59.615 --> 01:32:01.181
You don't fucking trust me or my
suppliers, that is your problem!

01:32:01.183 --> 01:32:03.049
You want to use
ammonium nitrate, fine with me!

01:32:03.051 --> 01:32:04.818
- Okay.
- Fine with me.

01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.653
Nate, Nate, Nate.
It's all right.

01:32:06.655 --> 01:32:09.956
It's fine, it's fine.
Morgan, Morgan, he's right.

01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:12.192
Come on. He's right.

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:18.031
So, can we see the suits?

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:21.034
And it's kind of
hard with the gloves,

01:32:21.036 --> 01:32:24.604
but... and you zip that up
and fasten along there.

01:32:24.606 --> 01:32:28.008
You guys, what would be worse,
radiation poisoning

01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:30.744
or wearing this thing
around for a couple hours?

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:32.579
Yeah.

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:42.289
<i>So if you ever have any doubt</i>

01:32:42.291 --> 01:32:45.892
<i>white men created civilization,
just go have a look.</i>

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:52.232
<i>How do you reason
with someone like that?</i>

01:32:52.234 --> 01:32:55.669
<i>How can you ever hope
to change their mind?</i>

01:33:14.055 --> 01:33:15.221
<i>Hello?</i>

01:33:15.223 --> 01:33:18.158
Hey, hey, listen,
something's wrong.

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:18.158
David drove to Frederick county

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:21.328
<i>early this morning
and went to a farm supply.</i>

01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:23.063
<i>It looks like he bought
ammonium nitrate.</i>

01:33:23.065 --> 01:33:24.631
And now they're all at Gerry's.

01:33:24.633 --> 01:33:25.899
But it's Saturday?

01:33:25.901 --> 01:33:27.734
And why do they need
ammonium nitrate?

01:33:27.736 --> 01:33:29.369
I don't know. Me and Hernandez
are heading over

01:33:29.371 --> 01:33:30.904
to meet the surveillance team
at Gerry's now.

01:33:30.906 --> 01:33:32.806
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know!

01:33:32.808 --> 01:33:34.641
No! No!
You can not raid them yet!

01:33:34.643 --> 01:33:36.142
You don't even know
if they have the cesium?

01:33:36.144 --> 01:33:38.244
And Gerry's phone's off.
Okay, I have to go over there.

01:33:38.246 --> 01:33:39.813
<i>No, Nate! It...</i>

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:43.383
Nate...
Come here!

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:51.992
- What are you doing here?
- I was calling, you didn't answer. I got worried.

01:33:51.994 --> 01:33:54.127
- Bullshit! Why are you here?
- I just told you!

01:33:54.129 --> 01:33:56.096
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

01:33:56.098 --> 01:33:57.764
Okay, what the fuck
is wrong with this guy?

01:33:57.766 --> 01:33:59.332
I called three times,
you didn't answer any of them!

01:33:59.334 --> 01:34:01.735
I got worried
something happened to you!

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:05.372
All right, put it down!
He's telling the truth!

01:34:05.374 --> 01:34:06.873
- Were you followed?
- - No, I wasn't!

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:08.308
- Are you sure?
- Yes! I was worried,

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:11.044
so I was checking constantly!

01:34:11.046 --> 01:34:13.146
Okay, calm down,
everybody calm down.

01:34:13.148 --> 01:34:15.782
Okay, can somebody tell me
what is going on?

01:34:15.784 --> 01:34:18.718
I sent David to do surveillance
on your shop last night.

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.421
I saw an electrical crew go into
the building across the street.

01:34:21.423 --> 01:34:23.923
- So?
- In the middle of the night?

01:34:23.925 --> 01:34:25.291
Could there be like
a power problem?

01:34:25.293 --> 01:34:28.261
No, they must have
traced the tatp you ordered.

01:34:28.263 --> 01:34:30.296
- Okay, if they're on to the shop...
- Fuck.

01:34:30.298 --> 01:34:31.731
They're on to you.

01:34:31.733 --> 01:34:33.033
Are you sure
you weren't followed?

01:34:33.035 --> 01:34:34.434
- Yes!
- If he said he wasn't, he wasn't!

01:34:34.436 --> 01:34:36.670
Stay calm
and keep your eyes open.

01:34:36.672 --> 01:34:38.938
Morgan, get back to work,
please, Jesus.

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:40.407
We had to move forward,
immediately.

01:34:40.409 --> 01:34:41.975
It would have been
only a matter of time

01:34:41.977 --> 01:34:43.276
before they were on to us, too.

01:34:43.278 --> 01:34:44.444
And you weren't
gonna let me know?

01:34:44.446 --> 01:34:47.414
Nate, I'm sorry. It's too risky.

01:34:47.416 --> 01:34:49.349
Well, he's here now,
let's get him to help!

01:34:49.351 --> 01:34:51.317
What about the tatp?

01:34:51.319 --> 01:34:54.020
David got
ammonium nitrate instead.

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:57.123
He used his name,
so the jig is up.

01:34:57.125 --> 01:34:58.792
They'll know it's us.

01:34:58.794 --> 01:35:00.894
It's not gonna matter tomorrow.

01:35:00.896 --> 01:35:02.729
We're in this
to the end now, Nate.

01:35:02.731 --> 01:35:07.233
Do you understand?
They're not gonna take us alive.

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.470
All right, let me help.

01:35:10.472 --> 01:35:14.207
Okay, okay, good.
Come over here.

01:35:20.081 --> 01:35:23.717
I should go wash up
so I don't contaminate anything.

01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:28.988
Oh...

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:30.890
Hey, Nate! How are you?

01:35:38.299 --> 01:35:40.033
- Nate!
- The cesium is here!

01:35:40.035 --> 01:35:41.768
All right, everyone!
Let's get ready to do this!

01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:43.937
No! Angela,
you have to tell him to wait.

01:35:43.939 --> 01:35:45.939
Wait? No, no, no,
we need to get in there now!

01:35:45.941 --> 01:35:48.208
There are three guys in there with machine
guns and they're building a bomb.

01:35:48.210 --> 01:35:50.243
This is a residential neighborhood.
His wife and kids are in the house.

01:35:50.245 --> 01:35:52.178
<i>If you come in here now,
it'll be a blood bath.</i>

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:53.847
This is a volatile situation.

01:35:53.849 --> 01:35:55.482
Yeah, which is why
we need to move now...

01:35:55.484 --> 01:35:57.751
No, he doesn't get it!
These guys are fanatics!

01:35:57.753 --> 01:35:59.119
They will not be taken alive!

01:35:59.121 --> 01:36:00.820
Tom, you're not in there!
We have to listen to him.

01:36:00.822 --> 01:36:02.388
And what the fuck happens
if the explosives go off

01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.388
<i>while we're waiting around?</i>

01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:05.825
<i>Nate, you got 60 seconds
to disarm those guys,</i>

01:36:05.827 --> 01:36:07.293
<i>because we're coming in.</i>

01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:11.498
Okay, let's get
these suits ready.

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:15.468
Okay, let's get ready to move!
We are almost done here!

01:37:10.357 --> 01:37:12.325
Fuck! The cesium spilled!

01:37:13.461 --> 01:37:15.962
Shit, get the suits on!
Go, go, go!

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:22.936
Come on!

01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:31.477
Come on, help me!
Help me!

01:37:31.479 --> 01:37:33.613
Get zipped up!
Get zipped up!

01:37:34.481 --> 01:37:37.150
Son of a...
Shit, come on!

01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:43.957
- Come on, get your hood on!
- No! No!

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:47.493
Stop!

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:53.299
Get the gun!

01:37:58.105 --> 01:38:00.073
It's me! It's me! It's me!

01:38:00.075 --> 01:38:02.375
Are you okay? You all right?

01:38:04.012 --> 01:38:06.045
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.

01:38:06.047 --> 01:38:08.648
I know my rights! I'm a
patriot of the United States!

01:38:08.650 --> 01:38:11.417
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Fuck you!

01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:16.489
Come on, get up!

01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:06.072
Surprise!

01:39:22.957 --> 01:39:25.425
<i>The paperwork came in...
Houston.</i>

01:39:25.427 --> 01:39:29.295
Yeah... Texas.
Can you believe it?

01:39:29.297 --> 01:39:31.230
Good margaritas, I hear.

01:39:31.232 --> 01:39:32.432
Yeah.

01:39:36.071 --> 01:39:39.105
Yeah, I'm gonna
miss it here, though.

01:39:42.142 --> 01:39:46.179
Well, "it's"
going to miss you, too.

01:39:49.216 --> 01:39:53.019
"This should have been
a noble creature;

01:39:53.021 --> 01:39:55.321
he hath all the energy
which would have made

01:39:55.323 --> 01:39:58.257
a goodly frame
of glorious elements,

01:39:58.259 --> 01:40:01.094
had they been wisely mingled."

01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:05.365
Gerry?

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:10.269
Yeah, Gerry,
and all of them, really.

01:40:12.506 --> 01:40:16.776
Yeah, that's why you were
the right guy for the job.

01:40:18.112 --> 01:40:19.545
What do you mean?

01:40:19.547 --> 01:40:22.015
Why do you think I picked you?

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:28.187
I knew that you
would understand them.

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:32.058
And they'd understand you.

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.227
And the more authentic
you became with them,

01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:36.496
the more authentic
they'd become with you.

01:40:40.267 --> 01:40:43.102
Because when it
comes down to it,

01:40:43.104 --> 01:40:49.375
there really is only one
essential ingredient to fascism.

01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:52.378
<i>It's victimhood.</i>

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:57.250
I blamed those black kids,

01:40:57.252 --> 01:41:00.086
and I blamed this school,

01:41:00.088 --> 01:41:05.124
I blamed the cops;
I blamed everybody.

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:11.597
I was gonna hurt everyone else
the way they hurt me.

01:41:11.599 --> 01:41:16.335
I look at you guys
and I see myself.

01:41:17.704 --> 01:41:21.707
But you guys don't have to make
the same mistakes I did.

01:41:23.277 --> 01:41:25.812
You don't have to be victims.

01:41:32.519 --> 01:41:33.719
Hey.

01:41:33.721 --> 01:41:35.721
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:37.824
That was great.

01:41:37.826 --> 01:41:42.628
Thanks. Dude, thanks...

01:41:42.630 --> 01:41:45.131
Thanks for coming by.

01:41:46.233 --> 01:41:48.534
I'm so proud of you, Johnny.

01:41:51.438 --> 01:41:52.872
You know what they say...

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:58.177
It all begins with the word.
