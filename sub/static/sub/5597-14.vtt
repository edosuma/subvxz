WEBVTT

00:01.173 --> 00:03.354
The meningioma is resting
between the occipital lobe

00:03.404 --> 00:04.670
and the cerebellum.

00:04.672 --> 00:07.439
It gives us reasonably
fair access for removal.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.141
What do you mean, "reasonably fair"?

00:09.143 --> 00:11.276
Hey, is that a drinking bird?

00:11.278 --> 00:13.245
Wow!

00:13.247 --> 00:16.381
I haven't seen one of
these since I was a kid.

00:16.383 --> 00:19.651
It's actually methylene chloride
that makes this thing work.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.386
Okay, look, I've done some
of my own research on this,

00:22.388 --> 00:24.155
and the growth rate of this type of tumor

00:24.157 --> 00:26.157
is 5% a year.

00:26.159 --> 00:28.225
It's 5.8, but please continue.

00:28.227 --> 00:30.428
Well, either way,
that means in three years' time,

00:30.430 --> 00:31.763
it could kill him.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.164
Well, don't beat around the bush, doc.

00:33.166 --> 00:34.632
Tell me how you really feel.

00:34.634 --> 00:36.533
Take it out now. That's how I really feel.

00:36.535 --> 00:38.569
Noted.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.236
Well, removal is best.

00:40.238 --> 00:42.238
But the tumor is benign, so we have time.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.307
You know, I really,
really wanted one of these

00:44.309 --> 00:46.142
- when I was a kid.
- Charlie.

00:46.144 --> 00:47.911
[exhales]

00:47.913 --> 00:50.213
- Will this affect his work?
- Not necessarily.

00:50.215 --> 00:52.282
As long as he's not feeling
any effects from it...

00:52.284 --> 00:56.018
- blurred vision, hallucinations.
- No. 100%.

00:57.153 --> 00:59.021
Relatively speaking.

01:02.092 --> 01:05.327
Why do I get the distinct
feeling you're upset?

01:05.328 --> 01:07.697
I don't know. Maybe because I am.

01:07.699 --> 01:09.798
Alex, you heard Shahir. There's no rush.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.066
The thing is benign.

01:11.068 --> 01:13.568
- That's not why I'm upset.
- Okay.

01:13.570 --> 01:15.236
You saw what happened to Kristine.

01:15.238 --> 01:16.571
Alex, Kristine's in a coma

01:16.573 --> 01:18.139
because she wrapped her car around a tree.

01:18.141 --> 01:19.608
You know that's not what I mean.

01:19.610 --> 01:22.944
We could finally have a
diagnosis for your thing.

01:22.946 --> 01:25.046
I just... I can't believe you're not jumping

01:25.048 --> 01:26.780
at the opportunity to get rid of it.

01:26.782 --> 01:28.215
Bec... [sighs] that's
because I don't believe

01:28.217 --> 01:29.717
one has to do with the other.

01:29.719 --> 01:34.187
You're afraid of losing your...
ability, aren't you?

01:34.189 --> 01:36.523
Alex.

01:36.525 --> 01:38.926
Can we maybe talk about this somewhere else?

01:38.928 --> 01:41.629
Sure, fine. I've got to get started anyway.

01:41.631 --> 01:44.130
- Honey.
- Yes?

01:44.132 --> 01:45.397
I love you.

01:45.399 --> 01:48.067
Me, too.

01:48.069 --> 01:49.869
Gotta go.

01:54.041 --> 01:56.109
[siren wailing] Precious cargo.
Coming through.

01:56.111 --> 01:57.476
Hey, ladies.

01:57.478 --> 01:59.078
This place is bigger than it looks.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.679
[radio chatter]

02:00.681 --> 02:01.880
Jackson, page psych.

02:01.882 --> 02:03.581
No. He's supposed to look like that.

02:03.583 --> 02:04.916
Davey Law.

02:04.918 --> 02:07.085
Jammed his neck at a fan convention.

02:07.087 --> 02:08.687
I'll be fine.

02:08.689 --> 02:11.056
[groans] Okay, that hurts.

02:11.058 --> 02:12.891
He could barely walk when we got to him.

02:12.893 --> 02:15.127
Dr. Miller, do you know who this is?

02:15.129 --> 02:16.695
I don't know. Dressed like a weirdo.

02:16.697 --> 02:19.664
Possible spray tan.
I'm gonna go with I don't care.

02:19.666 --> 02:22.033
Davey Law. "Warrior squad."

02:22.035 --> 02:25.903
You know... [deep voice]
"Release the warrior within."

02:25.905 --> 02:27.404
Who are you, Jackson?

02:27.406 --> 02:29.907
Look, I know the whole series by heart.
Even the TV movie.

02:29.909 --> 02:32.276
Which wasn't that good. The script sucked.

02:32.278 --> 02:34.244
Whatever.

02:34.246 --> 02:37.280
Mr. Law. Davey. Davey Law, sir.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.782
Need a cold shower, Jackson?

02:38.784 --> 02:40.216
Ignore him.

02:40.218 --> 02:42.686
It's always a pleasure
to meet a fellow warrior.

02:42.688 --> 02:44.287
- Warrior, huh?
- Ah!

02:44.289 --> 02:45.955
Okay, well, we're gonna need ortho.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.724
- Let's page Charlie.
- I'm on it.

02:47.726 --> 02:49.525
Davey Law's in the house.

02:49.527 --> 02:51.460
That's what I'm talking about.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.495
Can someone get Jackson a girlfriend?

02:54.664 --> 02:55.998
What have we got?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.167
Mordecai Popler, 13.

02:58.784 --> 03:00.335
He was admitted earlier this morning.

03:00.337 --> 03:02.571
No one can figure it out.
Severe abdominal distress,

03:02.573 --> 03:04.339
kid's in and out of consciousness.

03:04.341 --> 03:06.575
We've already got him on tons of fluids.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.310
Okay. Thank you.

03:11.847 --> 03:13.547
Are you Dr. Reid?

03:13.549 --> 03:15.850
- Please, call me Alex.
- Sarah.

03:15.852 --> 03:17.651
- This is Mordecai.
- Hi.

03:17.653 --> 03:20.021
Did you know that wearing
your hair up inhibits growth?

03:20.023 --> 03:21.288
I'm sorry?

03:21.290 --> 03:23.257
The follicles need oxygen.

03:23.259 --> 03:25.093
- Oh.
- Ignore him.

03:25.095 --> 03:27.027
That's all right. I grew up with brothers.

03:27.029 --> 03:28.762
Says that you, uh, live on the west side.

03:28.764 --> 03:30.296
That's a long way to come to Hope Zion.

03:30.298 --> 03:32.232
The doctors at the Gen are all quacks.

03:32.234 --> 03:34.067
- Mm.
- My mother hates them.

03:34.069 --> 03:35.435
Ow.

03:35.437 --> 03:37.137
Look, I know you've already
been through all of this,

03:37.139 --> 03:39.672
but I need to do a work-up
for my records, all right?

03:40.875 --> 03:42.808
Does it hurt when I press here?

03:42.810 --> 03:46.011
[weakly] No, but I... feel weird.

03:46.013 --> 03:48.156
Mordecai? Mordecai?
[monitors beeping erratically]

03:48.206 --> 03:49.930
Mordecai, I got you.
Okay, I'm gonna roll you over.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.133
- What's happening to him?
- He's seizing.

03:51.183 --> 03:52.016
You need to back away.

03:52.019 --> 03:54.854
I need lorazepam over here.
[beeping continues]

03:54.856 --> 03:56.555
I might have something in
here that can help him.

03:56.557 --> 03:57.857
Okay, you're gonna be all right.

03:57.859 --> 03:59.558
I'm right here with you, all right?

03:59.560 --> 04:01.860
[bottles rattling]

04:01.862 --> 04:03.995
Will any of these help him?!

04:03.997 --> 04:06.430
[beeping continues, fades]

04:08.000 --> 04:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:15.227 --> 04:17.062
Okay. [monitor beeping steadily]

04:17.064 --> 04:19.230
He's gonna be okay. Isn't he?

04:19.232 --> 04:21.466
We controlled his seizure with medication,

04:21.468 --> 04:23.734
and he's on a saline drip
to balance his fluids.

04:23.736 --> 04:25.202
Will that fix the problem?

04:25.204 --> 04:28.172
Temporarily, but we do still
need to run more tests.

04:28.174 --> 04:30.240
Right now we're only treating
the symptoms, not the cause.

04:30.242 --> 04:32.209
- What is the cause?
- Well...

04:32.211 --> 04:33.911
Mom?

04:33.913 --> 04:35.245
Can I have some water?

04:35.247 --> 04:36.747
There's my guy.

04:36.749 --> 04:38.682
Oh, I'm so glad you're awake.
Can he have a drink?

04:38.684 --> 04:40.717
- Sure. I'll page a nurse.
- Don't bother.

04:40.719 --> 04:42.652
He likes his own water bottle.

04:42.654 --> 04:45.655
Hypoallergenic, mold resistance.

04:45.657 --> 04:48.191
- Oh.
- He doesn't drink tap.

04:48.193 --> 04:51.495
Trace amounts of asbestos
is found in tap water.

04:51.497 --> 04:53.296
He's careful about everything.

04:53.298 --> 04:55.031
I can see that.

04:55.033 --> 04:58.066
You would be, too,
if you were sick all the time.

04:58.068 --> 05:00.536
[sighs]

05:00.538 --> 05:02.037
I'll need a detailed list

05:02.039 --> 05:03.472
of everything Mordecai's been taking

05:03.474 --> 05:05.173
in case something's contraindicated.

05:05.175 --> 05:10.412
Let's see. There's ciclesonide,
pirbuterol for his asthmas,

05:10.414 --> 05:12.514
duloxetine for his anxiety,

05:12.516 --> 05:14.916
ramelteon for his insomnia, what else?

05:14.918 --> 05:19.353
Methylphenidate. Helps me focus.

05:20.689 --> 05:23.958
That is a lot for a young man to be on.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.960
How long has he been sick?

05:25.962 --> 05:27.896
On and off his whole life.

05:29.197 --> 05:31.264
I guess he got worse when his dad left.

05:31.266 --> 05:35.536
I've taken him to every
specialist in the city, but...

05:35.538 --> 05:37.337
Do you have kids?

05:37.339 --> 05:38.572
I do.

05:38.574 --> 05:40.774
It hurts to watch them suffer

05:40.776 --> 05:43.043
when nobody can tell you why.

05:44.046 --> 05:45.412
Well, take it from me, Sarah,

05:45.414 --> 05:47.980
an answer always reveals itself.

05:47.982 --> 05:51.083
And I won't stop until this one does.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.718
Woman: It's him! It's him! It's really him.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.020
[excited murmuring]

05:54.022 --> 05:55.655
Can you feel me touching you here?

05:55.657 --> 05:58.958
Mm, yeah. You got magic fingers, doc.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.060
Can you spread your fingers
wide for me, please?

06:01.062 --> 06:03.062
Dr. Harris is just checking
for any nerve damage.

06:03.064 --> 06:05.630
So what exactly were you doing
when you hurt your neck?

06:05.632 --> 06:07.532
I was at a fan convention.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.500
Come on, man, don't tell
me you don't recognize me.

06:09.502 --> 06:10.869
No. Sorry.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.572
[scoffs]

06:13.574 --> 06:15.239
Release the warrior within.

06:15.241 --> 06:16.441
All: Release the warrior!

06:16.443 --> 06:17.676
"Warrior squad," huh?

06:17.678 --> 06:20.478
Bingo, bango. Whatever
junior makes, double it.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.679
Do you mind if I...

06:21.681 --> 06:23.447
[phone beeps]

06:24.549 --> 06:25.649
[camera shutter clicks]

06:27.518 --> 06:29.954
- I...
- "Warrior squad"?

06:29.956 --> 06:32.189
Uh, yeah, it was a TV show.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.124
My roommate watched it all the time.

06:34.126 --> 06:36.126
[under breath] It was really bad.

06:36.128 --> 06:37.860
[normal voice] Ass.

06:37.862 --> 06:40.563
[clears throat] Uh, it is super awesome.

06:40.565 --> 06:41.931
You're a terrible liar, kid.

06:41.933 --> 06:44.133
But I own three houses,
and one of them is really nice,

06:44.135 --> 06:45.201
so boom.

06:45.203 --> 06:47.804
Okay, so you're on a TV show?

06:47.806 --> 06:50.006
I was for 11 years.

06:50.008 --> 06:51.407
Captain Jim Gibbons,

06:51.409 --> 06:53.209
space barbarian, at your service.

06:53.211 --> 06:54.510
Oh.

06:54.512 --> 06:56.144
I was doing a stunt at the convention.

06:56.146 --> 06:58.046
I hoisted a clinger over my shoulder and...

06:58.048 --> 06:59.114
Clinger?

06:59.116 --> 07:00.682
Uh, half-snake, half-man.

07:00.684 --> 07:03.719
Right. Of course.
So where is the pain exactly?

07:03.721 --> 07:05.621
It's right here.

07:05.623 --> 07:07.089
In the T2 region?

07:07.091 --> 07:08.456
If you say so.

07:08.458 --> 07:09.691
Well, your mobility is limited,

07:09.693 --> 07:11.026
but we won't know anything for sure

07:11.028 --> 07:13.327
until we get you up to imaging, so...

07:13.329 --> 07:15.663
Well, wait. How long is that gonna take?

07:15.665 --> 07:17.598
Because I have to do another
appearance tomorrow.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.434
Well, I don't know for sure,
but I can tell you that

07:20.436 --> 07:21.736
the only appearance you're gonna be making

07:21.738 --> 07:23.638
is that of a patient at Hope Zion.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.674
Oh. Method. I like the way you think.

07:27.809 --> 07:30.710
[telephone rings in distance]

07:30.712 --> 07:33.412
Another farewell bundle for your last day.

07:33.414 --> 07:35.882
- Wow, what a beauty.
- Where should I put it?

07:35.884 --> 07:37.450
How about right there?

07:40.721 --> 07:44.124
<i>Or</i> we could put them here,

07:44.126 --> 07:46.091
where they could catch the light.

07:46.093 --> 07:47.559
Sorry, Dr. Williams,

07:47.561 --> 07:50.228
I just hate those long, sappy goodbyes,

07:50.230 --> 07:51.664
and the... oh. [groans]

07:51.666 --> 07:54.633
Yeah. Me, too.

07:54.635 --> 07:56.535
I'm really gonna miss you.

07:56.537 --> 07:58.570
Don't you do that.

07:58.572 --> 08:01.040
Oh. [sighs] Give me the form.

08:01.042 --> 08:02.174
Yeah.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.743
Must be hard to fill that out.

08:05.745 --> 08:08.946
Leave of absence? No,
not since they pulled me off surgery.

08:08.948 --> 08:11.515
[pen clicks] Consults just don't
float my boat in the same way.

08:11.517 --> 08:14.418
Yeah, I guess chemotherapy
and a surgeon's schedule

08:14.420 --> 08:16.020
don't make a great combo.

08:16.022 --> 08:18.455
They certainly don't...

08:18.457 --> 08:20.490
- You okay?
- [exhales]

08:20.492 --> 08:23.060
- Dr. Kinney?
- Yeah.

08:24.461 --> 08:25.896
[exhales]

08:25.898 --> 08:28.131
No, it's, um...

08:28.133 --> 08:29.766
Oh, it's just the lighting.

08:29.768 --> 08:32.068
Hmm.

08:32.071 --> 08:34.604
[cell phone vibrates]

08:34.606 --> 08:36.806
Oh, Dr. Lin needs me in the E.R.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.472
You know what? I-I... I'll stay here.

08:38.475 --> 08:39.975
I can get someone else to cover for me.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.745
No, don't you dare. Go. Be a doctor.

08:42.746 --> 08:44.613
Least one of us gets to, huh?

08:51.154 --> 08:54.155
So you're not taking the ofloxacin anymore.

08:54.157 --> 08:55.590
Are those the red ones?

08:55.592 --> 08:59.994
No. They stopped working,
or... think they did.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.431
Don't know why my mom brought them.

09:03.433 --> 09:05.200
Do you remember what you
were taking them for?

09:05.202 --> 09:09.704
I think an ear infection. Maybe?

09:09.706 --> 09:12.672
You're still choking your hair.

09:12.674 --> 09:14.208
It's a follicle thing.

09:14.210 --> 09:15.709
Oh, I see.

09:15.711 --> 09:18.178
I'm feeling pretty tired here.

09:18.180 --> 09:19.646
Mordecai, are you feeling weak?

09:19.648 --> 09:21.115
[monitor beeping rapidly]
Whoa, he's losing consciousness.

09:21.117 --> 09:23.650
- Mordecai? Mordecai?
- I thought you did a full neuro.

09:23.652 --> 09:25.152
I did. C.T. came back clean.

09:25.154 --> 09:28.354
Hey, can we get another I.V. in here?

09:28.356 --> 09:30.123
What the hell is going on with this kid?

09:30.125 --> 09:31.991
He's in sinus rhythm.

09:31.993 --> 09:33.659
He's moving air well, bilaterally.

09:33.661 --> 09:36.229
I wanna do a full drug panel
and redo his electrolytes.

09:36.231 --> 09:38.231
- You think we missed something?
- I know we did.

09:38.233 --> 09:41.200
[monitor continues beeping erratically]

09:43.503 --> 09:45.637
- What do we got?
- Botched robbery.

09:45.639 --> 09:47.739
Poor Carla here caught a stray
bullet in the left thigh.

09:47.741 --> 09:48.974
Any other victims on their way?

09:48.976 --> 09:50.541
No, the other victim died on scene.

09:50.543 --> 09:52.778
Female co-worker,
bullet actually passed through her

09:52.780 --> 09:54.612
before it struck Ms. Esposito.

09:54.614 --> 09:56.214
Other worker wasn't as lucky.

09:56.216 --> 09:58.817
[gasping] Okay, so this isn't
all her blood. Good to know.

09:58.819 --> 10:00.585
One, two, three.

10:00.587 --> 10:02.853
Ah! Ah! Carla, let's have a look.

10:02.855 --> 10:04.388
Please hurry. Please hurry!

10:04.390 --> 10:06.157
We're slammed. I told
Zach that we would fill in

10:06.159 --> 10:07.958
until it thins out.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.643
- We need to do a full trauma work-up here.
- I can still feel it. I can still feel it!

10:10.693 --> 10:11.861
Can I get something more for the pain, please?

10:11.864 --> 10:13.864
20 milligrams of propofol. Already on it.

10:13.866 --> 10:16.300
[gasping, shivering]

10:16.302 --> 10:18.568
How's it looking over there, Dr. Lin?

10:18.570 --> 10:20.336
I think the bullet severed a vein.

10:20.338 --> 10:23.239
- Oh, my god!
- Okay, just try to relax, Ms. Esposito.

10:23.241 --> 10:25.508
[monitor beeping rapidly] Oh, too relaxed.

10:25.510 --> 10:27.177
- Pressure's dropping.
- Okay, she's in shock.

10:27.179 --> 10:29.445
We need to get control of
this bleeding right away.

10:32.917 --> 10:35.551
Let me guess. Acute cervical sprain.

10:35.553 --> 10:37.452
I had a similar accident back in '07.

10:37.454 --> 10:40.622
A couple of twins.
One magical weekend in Bali.

10:40.624 --> 10:42.657
Nice. Bali.

10:42.659 --> 10:45.194
Well, it was the Bali
room at the Cadillac Inn.

10:45.196 --> 10:47.996
Niagara falls. But the twins were real.

10:47.998 --> 10:49.798
Some parts anyway.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.099
Yeah.

10:51.101 --> 10:54.135
Uh, Mr. Law, I wish this
was just a sprain, but, um,

10:54.137 --> 10:59.240
your X-rays have revealed
a mass on your spine.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.275
Imaging suggests the tumor's malignant.

11:01.277 --> 11:02.977
We'll need a biopsy to be sure.

11:02.979 --> 11:04.278
Wait, wait, wait.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.080
I heard him say tumor
when he actually meant...

11:06.082 --> 11:07.481
Tumor.

11:07.483 --> 11:09.483
Got it.

11:09.485 --> 11:11.151
You're very lucky to come in when you did

11:11.153 --> 11:12.652
when the mass is still small...

11:12.654 --> 11:15.222
As you can see.

11:15.224 --> 11:16.823
There's not much space in
that particular region,

11:16.825 --> 11:20.126
so, um, the spinal cord
can become compromised.

11:20.128 --> 11:21.928
You're going to require surgery.

11:21.930 --> 11:23.997
This is serious?

11:23.999 --> 11:26.733
Uh, I-I gotta call Penny.

11:26.735 --> 11:28.767
- Your wife?
- Worse. My agent.

11:28.769 --> 11:30.970
I don't do anything without her say-so.

11:30.972 --> 11:33.205
Uh, okay, but, um, if left untreated,

11:33.207 --> 11:35.174
this could lead to paralysis.

11:35.176 --> 11:37.442
Even death.

11:37.444 --> 11:40.079
But you said that it was still small.

11:40.081 --> 11:43.815
For now, but malignant
tumors are unpredictable.

11:43.817 --> 11:45.716
Yeah, well, so am I.

11:45.718 --> 11:49.120
And, uh, I'm not doing anything
without talking to my people.

11:50.589 --> 11:51.890
Yeah.

11:55.727 --> 11:57.561
[sighs]

11:59.631 --> 12:02.432
Sarah, your son has something
called hypernatremia.

12:02.434 --> 12:03.666
What does that mean?

12:03.668 --> 12:06.003
It means the sodium level
in his blood's too high.

12:06.005 --> 12:08.471
We've put him on a hypotonic fluid infusion.

12:08.473 --> 12:10.207
None of this means anything to me.

12:10.209 --> 12:12.009
I-is he gonna be okay?

12:12.011 --> 12:13.777
We're doing everything
we can to stabilize him.

12:13.779 --> 12:15.645
But is he gonna be okay?

12:15.647 --> 12:17.647
We have to normalize his levels.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.481
If we do it too quickly, we run the risk...

12:19.483 --> 12:21.850
Of what? What?

12:21.852 --> 12:23.419
His brain could swell.

12:23.421 --> 12:25.988
We need to find out why his
sodium levels are so high.

12:25.990 --> 12:27.189
You know, it would help

12:27.191 --> 12:28.524
if we knew some more about
his medical history,

12:28.526 --> 12:30.626
other doctors he's been to,
the tests they might've run.

12:30.628 --> 12:32.161
How the hell am I supposed to remember?

12:32.163 --> 12:33.963
There've been so many.

12:33.965 --> 12:36.664
Oh! I'm sorry. It never ends.

12:36.666 --> 12:40.235
Okay, Sarah. You said you'd
been to South General?

12:40.237 --> 12:41.970
Dr. Bishop and I can start there.

12:41.972 --> 12:45.473
That'll give you some
time to process all this.

12:45.475 --> 12:48.310
We're gonna do everything
we can to help your son.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.079
Okay.

12:54.215 --> 12:56.150
[voice breaks] Okay.

13:06.561 --> 13:09.362
[exhales deeply]

13:09.364 --> 13:10.663
Still on hold?

13:10.665 --> 13:12.698
I've had plane tickets refunded faster.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.733
- What have you got?
- Not much so far.

13:14.735 --> 13:16.169
He's not diabetic.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.736
Looking for anything else
that might've increased

13:17.738 --> 13:19.005
his fluid excretion.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.706
Like an underlying polyuria disorder?

13:20.708 --> 13:23.343
Yeah. Or if he was on diuretic therapy.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.778
No, none of those are diuretics.
I already checked.

13:25.780 --> 13:27.812
Dr. Haighton, Dr. Martin.

13:27.814 --> 13:29.581
There's even a Dr. Pepper in here.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.516
I hear he's a little salty.

13:31.518 --> 13:33.251
Tell me you are not making jokes right now.

13:33.253 --> 13:35.487
I'm just saying, who goes for
this many second opinions?

13:35.489 --> 13:38.323
A worried mother. I don't blame her.

13:38.325 --> 13:41.659
Wait a minute. Mordecai's been here before.

13:41.661 --> 13:43.394
At Hope Zion?

13:43.396 --> 13:46.430
Yeah, look at this. Last year.

13:46.432 --> 13:47.865
Now why didn't we see this?

13:47.867 --> 13:50.401
He was admitted under his
mother's maiden name.

13:50.403 --> 13:52.236
How come that wasn't the
first thing she mentioned

13:52.238 --> 13:53.837
when she brought him in?

13:53.839 --> 13:55.206
Let's find out.

14:00.849 --> 14:02.083
[sighs]

14:03.986 --> 14:06.387
Hey! It's Char-char and the Spazz.

14:06.389 --> 14:07.488
What's the verdict?

14:07.490 --> 14:09.956
Don't ever call me "Char-char" ever again.

14:09.958 --> 14:11.525
Yeah, why am I the Spazz? Huh?

14:11.527 --> 14:14.027
Hey, you know I'm kidding.
I love you guys. Come on.

14:14.029 --> 14:16.564
You must be Penny. The one and only.

14:16.566 --> 14:18.199
Are you his doctor?
'Cause he won't tell me anything.

14:18.201 --> 14:19.500
I don't want you to worry about me.

14:19.502 --> 14:21.802
Honey, it's my job to worry. So...

14:21.804 --> 14:23.403
All right, spill it. How bad is he?

14:23.405 --> 14:26.339
His biopsy has revealed
that the tumor is malignant.

14:27.741 --> 14:30.677
You have a tumor? Davey!

14:30.679 --> 14:32.312
You said you sprained your neck again.

14:32.314 --> 14:33.979
Penny, it's okay. It's no big deal.

14:33.981 --> 14:35.448
Isn't that right, tumor?

14:35.450 --> 14:37.250
[high-pitched voice]
Yeah, you're right, Davey.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.751
Normally, you'd have to wait, but, uh,

14:38.753 --> 14:41.320
we've had some cancellations,
and I can get him in today.

14:41.322 --> 14:43.422
The procedure will take a few hours.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.290
Okay! Great.

14:45.292 --> 14:47.859
All right, looks like you guys
have everything under control.

14:47.861 --> 14:50.562
No, wait. But tell her
about the recovery time.

14:50.564 --> 14:52.598
6 to 8 weeks, barring complications.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.201
See? There's no way I can be
on the shelf that long, right?

14:56.203 --> 14:58.001
Davey.

14:58.003 --> 15:00.238
Honey, this is your health, okay?

15:00.240 --> 15:02.005
I take it he has a pretty full schedule?

15:02.007 --> 15:04.808
Well, our business is day to day
so you never know when it's,

15:04.810 --> 15:06.244
- you know, about to get busy.
- I do.

15:06.246 --> 15:09.447
It just hasn't been busy for Davey lately.

15:09.449 --> 15:11.616
Not since "Warrior" got canceled.

15:11.618 --> 15:13.816
Oh, that was, like, 7 years ago.

15:13.818 --> 15:16.018
It's gonna pick up, though. I-I'm certain.

15:16.020 --> 15:19.055
For now, though,
the next event isn't for months.

15:19.057 --> 15:21.057
So you should do the surgery.

15:21.059 --> 15:22.692
[cell phone vibrates]

15:22.694 --> 15:24.294
Oh, my god. Okay, this is big.

15:24.296 --> 15:26.396
[singsong voice] Hi!

15:27.765 --> 15:30.199
Hey, man.

15:30.201 --> 15:32.668
Just... think about the fans.

15:35.071 --> 15:38.440
So what the hell? Let's do it.
What have I got to lose?

15:40.443 --> 15:43.345
Good news. We found no
fractures or internal bleeding.

15:43.347 --> 15:45.781
C.T.s and X-rays show that it's not located

15:45.783 --> 15:47.015
near any major vessels.

15:48.884 --> 15:51.686
Uh, so we're giving you
a round of antibiotics

15:51.688 --> 15:53.388
for infection.

15:53.390 --> 15:56.023
Other than that, you'll be good to go.

15:56.025 --> 15:59.126
What... what about the bullet?

15:59.128 --> 16:00.861
Well, because of where it's settled,

16:00.863 --> 16:03.063
there's no medical reason to remove it.

16:03.065 --> 16:06.300
Wait, so you're gonna...

16:06.302 --> 16:08.268
You're gonna leave this thing inside me?

16:08.270 --> 16:09.936
You can't do that.

16:09.938 --> 16:11.605
I know it seems unorthodox, but...

16:11.607 --> 16:13.607
[crying] No, he had a gun in my face.

16:13.609 --> 16:14.908
My face.

16:14.910 --> 16:16.510
Take it out. No. Please.

16:16.512 --> 16:17.778
- Carla, stop.
- Take it out!

16:17.780 --> 16:19.145
Please just take it out!

16:19.147 --> 16:20.814
I cannot live with this thing inside of me!

16:20.816 --> 16:22.915
Please!

16:24.518 --> 16:27.085
Paula worked next to me for five years.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.488
We ate lunch together.

16:30.791 --> 16:33.292
Now she's dead because of me.

16:33.294 --> 16:36.228
Because when... [sniffles]

16:36.230 --> 16:40.932
Because when I... saw the gun,
I hid behind her.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.935
[sniffles]

16:43.937 --> 16:45.603
[inhales sharply]

16:45.605 --> 16:48.473
God, what kind of a person
does something like that?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.809
[sniffles, crying]

16:50.811 --> 16:52.811
I guess I do.

16:56.314 --> 16:58.148
Every time I look down at this thing,

16:58.150 --> 17:00.384
that's all I'm gonna remember.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.520
Please, I am begging you.

17:04.922 --> 17:07.657
[sighs] So we're not
gonna remove the bullet?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.626
We're doing the right thing, Cassie.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.328
It's not medically necessary.

17:11.329 --> 17:14.364
Plus, it's a plastics issue.
So take it up with Storms.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.699
What are you gonna take up with Storms?

17:19.770 --> 17:22.905
- Ah. The bank robbery victim.
- Mm-hmm.

17:22.906 --> 17:24.840
Bullet removal's a slippery slope.

17:24.843 --> 17:26.642
One I'm not going down.

17:26.644 --> 17:29.311
Her new mantra is,
"if it's not medically necessary."

17:29.313 --> 17:32.013
Oh. So what does Storms say?

17:32.015 --> 17:34.048
He says it's discretionary.

17:34.050 --> 17:36.685
Okay. Well, tell that to the cops.

17:36.687 --> 17:37.919
That bullet could put away

17:37.921 --> 17:39.521
the guy who's responsible for this, so...

17:39.523 --> 17:43.291
Speaking as the person who
almost got her ass sued off,

17:43.293 --> 17:44.893
I'm not diving into a difficult procedure

17:44.895 --> 17:47.194
without having any experience.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.730
Well, good thing I do, then.

17:49.732 --> 17:51.899
I thought you were pulled from surgery?

17:51.901 --> 17:54.134
Doesn't mean she can't oversee.

17:54.136 --> 17:56.404
Come on, Lin.

17:56.406 --> 17:58.272
Sitting on the sidelines is

17:58.274 --> 17:59.807
killing me faster than the cancer.

17:59.809 --> 18:02.543
Ooh, cancer card.

18:04.144 --> 18:07.914
You gonna let me cyrano your
surgery or not? Come on.

18:10.818 --> 18:12.652
No. No, thank you.

18:12.654 --> 18:15.154
I will call you if I
have any other questions.

18:15.156 --> 18:16.856
Egg salad or ham and cheese?

18:16.858 --> 18:18.758
Egg salad, egg salad, egg salad, egg salad.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.492
I hate egg salad.

18:20.494 --> 18:22.728
Yes, but this one's from a vending machine.

18:24.230 --> 18:26.765
Ham it is.

18:26.767 --> 18:28.333
So, the infusion isn't working.

18:28.335 --> 18:30.335
His sodium levels are still elevated.

18:30.337 --> 18:32.203
How? That makes no sense.

18:32.205 --> 18:33.605
Well, it might.

18:33.607 --> 18:34.973
I just got off the phone with St. Vic's

18:34.975 --> 18:36.575
and he was admitted four times this year.

18:36.577 --> 18:38.576
I thought he was at South General.

18:38.578 --> 18:41.779
He was, and, uh, St. Mary's, uh, Memorial.

18:41.781 --> 18:44.248
He's been in and out of
hospital over 20 times

18:44.250 --> 18:46.116
- in the last 2 years.
- 20?

18:46.118 --> 18:48.786
And the last time at
St. Vic's was for high sodium levels.

18:48.788 --> 18:50.020
Interesting.

18:50.022 --> 18:51.856
When they got his levels down,
they released him.

18:51.858 --> 18:53.458
Sarah was supposed to bring
him in for a post-consult.

18:53.460 --> 18:57.293
- And she didn't show.
- You got it. Why?

18:57.295 --> 18:58.628
Why wouldn't she?

18:58.630 --> 19:00.597
Well, maybe the same
reason she didn't tell us

19:00.599 --> 19:02.198
he was admitted under a fake name

19:02.200 --> 19:04.200
with these exact same symptoms.

19:04.202 --> 19:06.803
She doesn't want him to get better.

19:06.805 --> 19:09.840
I'll follow your lead. You just
tell me how you wanna play this.

19:09.842 --> 19:12.708
Page social work. Get them here ASAP.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.042
Where are you going?

19:14.044 --> 19:16.712
To talk to her myself.

19:18.701 --> 19:20.234
Where are we going?

19:20.236 --> 19:21.836
Just for a little walk.

19:21.838 --> 19:24.405
I thought we could speak for a moment.

19:24.407 --> 19:26.541
This must be incredibly difficult for you.

19:26.543 --> 19:29.343
I try not to focus on that.

19:29.345 --> 19:32.213
So you have people? You have support?

19:32.215 --> 19:33.782
Sure.

19:33.784 --> 19:35.549
I have friends, family.

19:35.551 --> 19:37.951
Everyone's been really sympathetic.

19:37.953 --> 19:40.453
They've been there for me.

19:40.455 --> 19:43.490
Get a lot of attention?

19:43.492 --> 19:45.659
I'm not sure what you're implying.

19:45.661 --> 19:48.696
We've been going over your
son's medical records.

19:48.698 --> 19:51.631
Some of the dots we've been
connecting are alarming.

19:51.633 --> 19:53.800
What are you talking about?

19:53.802 --> 19:55.735
He's been in and out of
hospital over 20 times

19:55.737 --> 19:57.303
in the last two years alone.

19:57.305 --> 19:58.838
He's a sick boy.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.907
Why'd you skip the follow-up appointment

20:00.909 --> 20:02.875
the last time he had these sodium issues?

20:02.877 --> 20:05.111
Because he was feeling better.

20:05.113 --> 20:07.379
I... I didn't wanna drag him in for nothing.

20:07.381 --> 20:09.748
I still don't understand
why you didn't explain

20:09.750 --> 20:11.583
that this has happened before.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.119
Because I wanted you to
draw your own conclusions.

20:14.121 --> 20:16.021
I didn't want you to take any shortcuts.

20:16.023 --> 20:19.191
Sarah, I think you should see someone.

20:19.193 --> 20:21.259
A social worker.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.394
What?!

20:23.396 --> 20:24.996
No.

20:24.998 --> 20:26.764
I need to get back to him.

20:26.766 --> 20:28.766
I'm sorry.

20:28.768 --> 20:31.401
Sarah, you can't see your son
until you've been evaluated.

20:31.403 --> 20:33.470
You can't possibly think
I would do something

20:33.472 --> 20:34.839
to hurt my own child.

20:34.841 --> 20:37.507
I am just trying to figure out
what's going on. That's all.

20:37.509 --> 20:39.376
Join the club!

20:39.378 --> 20:41.779
I've spent years waiting for
an explanation from you people,

20:41.781 --> 20:43.646
years praying for someone to tell me

20:43.648 --> 20:45.081
what the hell is wrong with him.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.450
But you don't understand that, do you?

20:47.452 --> 20:49.619
- Sophia Barns, social work.
- Oh.

20:49.621 --> 20:51.687
Dr. Bishop paged me. Should I come back?

20:51.689 --> 20:53.689
No, take it from here.

21:00.764 --> 21:03.799
[monitor beeping steadily]

21:07.703 --> 21:09.071
Where's my mom?

21:09.073 --> 21:10.873
She had to step out for a few minutes.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.741
But I wanted to tell you the good news.

21:12.743 --> 21:14.309
Your levels are balancing out.

21:14.311 --> 21:16.778
Does that mean you fixed me?

21:16.780 --> 21:18.880
Not yet. But you are definitely on the mend.

21:20.916 --> 21:22.449
Can I have more water?

21:22.451 --> 21:24.051
Sure, of course.

21:27.856 --> 21:30.557
Hey, Mordecai, who
prepares your food at home?

21:30.559 --> 21:32.393
- My mom does.
- Oh.

21:32.395 --> 21:33.994
Why?

21:33.996 --> 21:37.063
No one else? Not an aunt or a grandmother?

21:40.234 --> 21:41.434
No.

21:42.770 --> 21:44.271
Even before my dad left,

21:44.273 --> 21:48.574
he never made dinner or anything.

21:48.576 --> 21:50.943
Said mom was too critical when he did.

21:50.945 --> 21:53.512
She likes to oversee things, huh?

21:53.514 --> 21:56.648
It's only because she cares.

21:56.650 --> 21:59.584
Why do you think she takes me
to so many doctors all the time?

22:02.255 --> 22:05.691
[monitors beeping steadily]

22:05.693 --> 22:07.193
Cassie: So, according to the scan,

22:07.195 --> 22:09.160
it looks like this thing's
near the femoral artery.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.661
Maggie: That's closer than we'd like,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.864
and pretty far from the entry wound.

22:12.866 --> 22:15.366
Dana: We'll need to make a note
later for chain of evidence.

22:15.368 --> 22:17.601
I'm starting to wonder if this thing

22:17.603 --> 22:19.103
isn't deeper than we thought.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.139
- Maybe we should stop.
- No, no.

22:21.141 --> 22:23.141
No one's gonna sue you, Dr. Lin.

22:23.143 --> 22:24.542
I can't help but wonder

22:24.544 --> 22:26.576
what I would do if I was in her shoes.

22:27.178 --> 22:28.812
If I was the one under fire.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.314
Well, I don't think you can really know

22:30.316 --> 22:32.349
until it's your ass on the line.

22:33.351 --> 22:35.418
[telephone rings in distance]

22:41.092 --> 22:42.624
What the hell's going on, doc?

22:42.626 --> 22:44.894
You said I didn't have
anything to worry about.

22:44.896 --> 22:46.762
You don't.

22:48.398 --> 22:49.698
Look.

22:49.700 --> 22:52.134
I just floated out of my body in there.

22:52.136 --> 22:53.635
I didn't go to med school or anything,

22:53.637 --> 22:55.571
but I'm pretty sure that
that means I'm dead.

22:55.573 --> 22:58.374
Not dead. I'm scrubbing
into your surgery right now.

22:58.376 --> 23:02.043
But I am glad to see you taking
this a little more seriously.

23:02.045 --> 23:05.646
Wait, wait. Hold on a sec.

23:07.516 --> 23:09.050
[exhales slowly]

23:09.052 --> 23:10.685
- We're good.
- And he's back.

23:10.687 --> 23:12.854
Okay, why don't you just
kick back and relax?

23:12.856 --> 23:14.655
And we'll get to you before you know it.

23:14.657 --> 23:16.156
Penny.

23:16.158 --> 23:18.692
Yeah, go visit Penny. See how she's doing.

23:18.694 --> 23:21.695
No, look. She's right there.

23:21.697 --> 23:23.463
Dr. Harris, there's a woman outside.

23:23.465 --> 23:25.933
She's asking for you.
She says it's an emergency.

23:25.935 --> 23:28.769
Um, I'm about to do a surgery here, so...

23:28.771 --> 23:31.238
She's flipping out.
She says you can't operate,

23:31.240 --> 23:32.972
that you have to wake up the patient.

23:32.974 --> 23:34.840
Something about "Ashes and rust."

23:34.842 --> 23:37.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa. "Ashes and rust"?

23:37.012 --> 23:39.078
This is important, Charlie.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.579
Go see what Penny wants. Go to her.

23:40.581 --> 23:44.350
I-I will after the surgery.

23:44.352 --> 23:47.720
I mean, uh, I-I will... then.

23:53.793 --> 23:55.994
Now, Charlie! I'm not kidding around, man.

23:55.996 --> 23:57.595
This is life or death.

23:57.597 --> 23:59.731
[sighs] Actually, Davey,
this is life and death.

23:59.733 --> 24:01.967
Charlie!

24:01.969 --> 24:04.002
- Calm down.
- [exhales]

24:04.004 --> 24:07.571
I'm asking you to go outside.
Can you do that for me. Please?

24:09.808 --> 24:12.376
[stomps] Come on, man.

24:17.515 --> 24:18.983
[huffs]

24:18.985 --> 24:20.418
It's an independent.

24:20.420 --> 24:22.820
But it's a serious film, and it's the lead.

24:22.822 --> 24:25.455
I need my script.
I made notes in the margins.

24:25.457 --> 24:27.757
It's in the nightstand.
My passport's in there, too.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.759
Wait. I thought you wanted
him to have the surgery.

24:29.761 --> 24:32.362
I did. But he's been
waiting his entire career

24:32.364 --> 24:34.064
for an opportunity like this.

24:34.066 --> 24:35.432
Trust me.

24:35.434 --> 24:36.799
Where's my big bag?

24:36.801 --> 24:39.002
Listen, Davey's hanging on at the agency

24:39.004 --> 24:41.370
- by a thread as it is.
- What?

24:41.372 --> 24:44.906
If he knew what was at stake,
he'd ask you to wake him up.

24:44.908 --> 24:46.408
Come on. Where's your ethics?

24:46.410 --> 24:48.677
- She's right, bro.
- You're not next of kin.

24:48.679 --> 24:50.145
Oh!

24:50.147 --> 24:52.781
His mother lost her mind years ago.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.283
I'm the closest he has.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.352
Okay, well, then you'll care
about him enough to understand

24:56.354 --> 24:57.919
that "Ashes and rust" can wait.

24:57.921 --> 24:59.820
No, it can't. Get in there and wake me up.

24:59.822 --> 25:01.822
Oh, so he mentioned "Ashes," then?

25:01.824 --> 25:03.257
Loosely.

25:03.259 --> 25:06.494
Yeah. Did he also mention
that it shoots in Romania?

25:06.496 --> 25:09.864
And that I have to have him on
a set in less than 48 hours.

25:09.866 --> 25:11.699
48 hours? Crap.

25:11.701 --> 25:13.201
You gotta wake me up, Charlie. I'm serious.

25:13.203 --> 25:15.302
Tick-tock, doc.

25:15.304 --> 25:17.937
Wake me up!

25:17.939 --> 25:20.673
She's with a psychiatrist now.
It's too soon to know anything.

25:20.675 --> 25:22.509
I still need to talk to the child.

25:22.511 --> 25:23.810
And then?

25:23.812 --> 25:26.646
And then, based on what he says,
we notify the police.

25:26.648 --> 25:29.049
Man over P.A.:
<i>Code blue. I.C.U. bay three.</i>

25:29.051 --> 25:32.251
- <i>Code blue. I.C.U. bay three.</i>
- That's Mordecai.

25:35.188 --> 25:37.323
[monitor beeping rapidly]
Bishop, talk to me.

25:37.325 --> 25:39.058
Pressure's falling.
His potassium's sky high.

25:39.060 --> 25:40.359
His creatinine's more than doubled.

25:40.361 --> 25:44.563
Okay, ready? Three, two, one, switch.

25:44.565 --> 25:46.565
His kidneys are failing.

25:46.567 --> 25:49.700
I need immediate insulin, D-50,
calcium, and diuretics.

25:49.702 --> 25:51.736
Now let's tube him.

25:51.738 --> 25:53.838
Mordecai, come on. Stay with us here.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.307
[breathing heavily]

25:56.309 --> 25:57.909
Come on.

25:57.911 --> 26:01.446
The hydrodissect will help you
see the bullet in ultrasound.

26:01.448 --> 26:03.148
Makes it easier to excise.

26:03.150 --> 26:06.750
[monitor beeping steadily]

26:06.752 --> 26:08.552
- There it is.
- Huh.

26:08.554 --> 26:10.487
Dr. Williams, would you
like to do the honors?

26:10.804 --> 26:12.244
I'd love to.

26:12.294 --> 26:13.456
Scalpel.

26:13.459 --> 26:16.927
[monitor beeping steadily]

26:21.399 --> 26:23.966
[slicing]

26:27.037 --> 26:28.938
Good.

26:28.940 --> 26:31.107
You need to get through the
fascia to the muscle fibers.

26:31.109 --> 26:32.208
Scissors.

26:33.677 --> 26:35.644
Could you use your fingers for that?

26:35.646 --> 26:37.547
Sure. To each his own.

26:37.549 --> 26:39.382
You just have to make sure
that you don't touch the bullet

26:39.384 --> 26:41.116
with those scissors for ballistics, right?

26:41.118 --> 26:43.017
Mm-hmm.

26:49.925 --> 26:51.726
Hmm.

26:51.728 --> 26:54.262
Oh, this damn thing's the
"Where's Waldo?" of bullets.

26:54.264 --> 26:56.516
[chuckles] Where's what?

26:57.133 --> 27:00.301
Oh, I remember when you were
the baby face in the O.R., Lin?

27:00.303 --> 27:01.635
Look at you. All grown up.

27:01.637 --> 27:04.771
Dana? You okay?

27:04.773 --> 27:07.475
What? Yeah, sorry.
I don't know what happened there.

27:07.477 --> 27:09.910
Whoa. What's going on?

27:09.912 --> 27:11.412
Oh!

27:11.414 --> 27:12.946
What'd you do? Did you cut something?

27:12.948 --> 27:14.914
No. I don't think so.

27:14.916 --> 27:17.417
It's 'cause I distracted you.
You may have nicked the femoral.

27:17.419 --> 27:18.951
Let me see.

27:20.621 --> 27:22.388
We're gonna have to leave the bullet.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.257
What? The hell we are. Let me in there.

27:24.259 --> 27:26.726
Lin, slow the bleeding.
Keep the wound clean for me.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.862
- We'll repair the artery after.
- Uh, do we have time for that?

27:29.864 --> 27:32.297
Look at me. We're fine.

27:32.299 --> 27:33.732
Just keep your finger in there

27:33.734 --> 27:35.467
until I get things under control.

27:35.469 --> 27:37.802
Okay, I need a bigger visual.
[monitor beeping]

27:37.804 --> 27:40.405
- Help me set up the retractors.
- SATs are dropping, people.

27:40.407 --> 27:41.806
Give her more volume.

27:41.808 --> 27:43.675
What... what are you doing?

27:43.677 --> 27:47.112
Well, if we don't get it now,
they'll never let us back in.

27:48.313 --> 27:49.514
She's tachy.

27:49.516 --> 27:51.115
More volume.

[monitor beeping rapidly]

27:54.487 --> 27:57.355
Almost there.

And I got it. Give me the rubber tips.

[beeping continues]

28:10.368 --> 28:13.102
All right, and I want that in an airtight jar.

28:13.104 --> 28:15.539
- Wow. That was...
- All right.

28:15.541 --> 28:17.106
That was... wow.

28:17.108 --> 28:18.375
All right, doctors, on to the next thing.

28:18.377 --> 28:20.009
Let's repair that artery, shall we?

28:20.011 --> 28:21.645
Okay... [speaks indistinctly]

28:21.647 --> 28:24.412
[breathes sharply]

28:25.882 --> 28:27.216
- Dana.
- Hmm?

28:27.218 --> 28:29.418
- That was just...
- Better than sex.

28:29.420 --> 28:30.852
Yeah.

28:30.854 --> 28:33.088
Close, but we pulled it out of the fire.

28:33.090 --> 28:35.123
Mm-hmm. <i>You</i> pulled it
out of the fire.

28:35.125 --> 28:37.125
I kind of stuck it in the fire, actually.

28:37.127 --> 28:38.994
No. That was my fault completely,

28:38.996 --> 28:40.428
but aren't you glad it happened?

28:40.430 --> 28:41.996
'Cause it took the edge off, didn't it?

28:41.998 --> 28:43.531
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Yeah.

28:43.533 --> 28:44.799
I owe you.

28:44.801 --> 28:46.701
Oh, honey, you try to be perfect,

28:46.703 --> 28:48.769
you're gonna screw up, guaranteed.

28:48.771 --> 28:50.605
Plus, perfect is so boring.

28:50.607 --> 28:53.074
Mm, I don't know if I
completely agree with you

28:53.076 --> 28:54.676

28:54.678 --> 28:57.411
Oh. No, stop. You're not so bad.

28:57.413 --> 29:00.247

- [groans]

29:00.249 --> 29:03.350
Dana? Okay, I need some help out here.

29:03.352 --> 29:06.320
- Just relax. You need to sit up. Okay.
- Oh.

29:13.678 --> 29:15.879
What are you doing?

29:17.008 --> 29:18.641
I said wake me up.

29:18.643 --> 29:20.108
And what should I tell people?

29:20.110 --> 29:22.812
That, uh, I woke him up
'cause his ghost told me to?

29:22.814 --> 29:25.981
Just say new information presented itself.

29:25.983 --> 29:27.249
Look, what is it that you guys say?

29:27.251 --> 29:29.584
Your... your-your motto.
What the hell is it?

29:29.586 --> 29:31.085
- "Do no harm."
- Yeah, that's the one.

29:31.087 --> 29:32.487
You're breaking it, bro.

29:32.489 --> 29:34.356
By... by telling you you
need this operation?

29:34.358 --> 29:35.889
You said yourself that it could wait.

29:35.939 --> 29:37.446
I said maybe it could wait,

29:37.496 --> 29:39.045
with "maybe" being the operative word.

29:39.095 --> 29:40.594
Come on. This is bull!

29:40.596 --> 29:43.097
Look, it's a job, Davey. It's a job.

29:43.099 --> 29:44.698
Another one's gonna come around, right?

29:44.700 --> 29:47.433
Oh. [laughs] Oh, will it?

29:47.435 --> 29:50.770
Oh, all right. Thanks, bro.
I feel way better.

29:50.772 --> 29:52.105
Okay, then you still have the conventions.

29:52.107 --> 29:54.607
Yeah! Awesome. Awesome.

29:54.609 --> 29:59.545
Hey, did it ever occur to you
that I hate dressing up like...

29:59.547 --> 30:02.982
like-like an idiot?!
And mugging for the cameras?

30:02.984 --> 30:06.299
- You could've fooled me.
- Yeah, 'cause that's my job.

30:07.521 --> 30:10.522
Well, if you hate it so
much then why do you do it?

30:10.524 --> 30:13.993
Because I didn't think
it was gonna be forever.

30:13.995 --> 30:17.963
Look, I was a weird,
misfit kid from Kingston,

30:17.965 --> 30:21.299
and I busted my ass to get into Yale.

30:21.301 --> 30:24.202
Well, that's impressive.

30:24.204 --> 30:26.604
Yeah.

30:26.606 --> 30:28.139
I was.

30:28.141 --> 30:30.241
I played all the leads.

30:30.243 --> 30:34.946
Hamlet, Stanley.

30:34.948 --> 30:37.080
God, I loved being onstage.

30:37.082 --> 30:38.848
So what happened?

30:39.780 --> 30:42.219
Right out of theater school,
I booked "Warrior."

30:42.221 --> 30:43.987
They put a pile of money in front of me.

30:43.989 --> 30:45.889
Suddenly, I could walk into a store,

30:45.891 --> 30:49.159
and I could buy anything I wanted.

30:49.161 --> 30:53.130
And it went out as fast as it came in.

30:53.132 --> 30:55.164
And it took who I was with it.

30:55.166 --> 30:57.333
Oh, come on, Davey.

30:57.335 --> 31:00.036
No, now I am a classically trained monkey,

31:00.038 --> 31:02.071

"Move here."
"Do the stunt, Davey."

31:04.075 --> 31:06.842
"Dance, monkey. Dance, dance, dance!"

31:06.844 --> 31:09.511
You really think this role's
gonna change all that?

31:13.382 --> 31:15.483
I don't know.

31:15.485 --> 31:19.554
But when you're at the bottom, Charlie,

31:19.556 --> 31:21.556
I figure there's only one way to go.

31:24.961 --> 31:27.862
Wake me the hell up.
Can you... can you do that?

31:27.864 --> 31:30.364
I can't.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.632
Come on.

31:32.634 --> 31:36.636
Hey, man. Please. Please.

31:36.638 --> 31:38.805
If I wake you up, and you walk out of here,

31:38.807 --> 31:43.444
this thing... this thing could kill you.

31:43.446 --> 31:50.850
And if you don't, I'm already dead, so...

31:53.153 --> 31:56.422
Dev: Can we page him again, please?

31:59.926 --> 32:01.361
Sorry about that. Something came up.

32:01.363 --> 32:04.596
Dr. Harris, I was starting to
worry you weren't gonna show up.

32:04.598 --> 32:06.064
Ready to do this?

32:06.066 --> 32:09.534
[sighs]

32:09.536 --> 32:12.137
Some new information's presented itself.

32:16.642 --> 32:18.810
We need to wake him up.

32:18.812 --> 32:20.011
I don't get it. Let's regroup.

32:20.013 --> 32:21.379
Figure out what we might've missed.

32:21.381 --> 32:22.513
Alex, we've done every test out there.

32:22.515 --> 32:23.847
We haven't missed anything.

32:23.849 --> 32:25.816
Then why is that kid hanging
by a thread in there?

32:25.818 --> 32:27.084
I don't know.

32:27.086 --> 32:29.086
Okay, let's retrace the treatment plan.

32:29.088 --> 32:31.122
His levels were under control
when I talked to Sarah.

32:31.124 --> 32:33.057
And she hasn't been anywhere near him.

32:33.059 --> 32:35.359
And he's been monitored
every hour on the hour.

32:35.361 --> 32:39.295
So what happened?

32:39.297 --> 32:41.364
He asked me for a drink.

32:45.002 --> 32:48.038
[monitor beeping steadily]

Yeah, I bet.

33:00.051 --> 33:04.553
What's wrong? Where's my mom?

33:04.555 --> 33:06.755
That's, uh, that's kind of

33:06.757 --> 33:09.958
what we wanted to talk to you about.

33:09.960 --> 33:13.394
We found out some stuff from
the tests we've been running.

33:13.396 --> 33:17.865
You did? Like what?

33:17.867 --> 33:20.501
Did you find out why I'm sick?

33:20.503 --> 33:23.904
I think... I think we might've.

33:23.906 --> 33:28.741
So... what is it?

33:28.743 --> 33:33.513
Mordecai, we think you've been
inadvertently ingesting poison.

33:35.649 --> 33:40.387
Hold on. You think someone's
been poisoning me?

33:41.855 --> 33:45.157
Who... would do that?

33:45.159 --> 33:48.094
I wanna talk to my mom.

33:48.096 --> 33:51.029
She can't talk to you right now, honey.

33:51.031 --> 33:53.065
Why not?

33:53.067 --> 33:54.933
Well, she's talking to someone

33:54.935 --> 33:58.104
that might be able to help her out.

33:58.106 --> 34:02.673
You don't think my mom did
any of this, d-do you?

34:02.675 --> 34:07.579
The most important thing is
for you to get some rest.

34:07.581 --> 34:12.150
No. My mom didn't do anything.

34:12.152 --> 34:14.085
You have to tell them that.

34:14.087 --> 34:16.020
How do you know that?

34:16.022 --> 34:19.755
I just... I do.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.425
Okay?

34:21.427 --> 34:23.260
How?

34:23.262 --> 34:26.630

34:26.632 --> 34:31.935
It's all right, Mordecai.

You already know, don't you?

34:36.773 --> 34:38.841

34:42.812 --> 34:44.847
It was me.

34:47.583 --> 34:50.886

Not till I got the flu.

It was like I got sick, and you came back.
