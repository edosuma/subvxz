Previously on Siren.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.661
[Beth] Members
of the group rarely leave.

00:06.670 --> 00:08.114
When they do, people remember.

00:08.120 --> 00:10.998
What happened to your folks
wasn't right.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.661
I'll never forget it.

00:12.670 --> 00:14.820
[Ted] You were asking
about the well.

00:14.830 --> 00:17.537
There used to be
a cottage next to It,
am I right?

00:17.540 --> 00:18.575
That's right.
How 'd you know that?

00:18.580 --> 00:20.207
[movie projector running]

00:20.210 --> 00:21.666
For you.

00:21.670 --> 00:23.160
So you remember me.

00:23.170 --> 00:24.660
[Ryn]
Others in danger.

00:24.670 --> 00:26.160
He save them,

00:26.170 --> 00:27.239
but he die.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.877
Can we just--
just fact check?

00:28.880 --> 00:30.666
So the three of you

00:30.670 --> 00:32.615
are working
with the military

00:32.620 --> 00:35.783
to get some genetic goo
out of Ryn,

00:35.790 --> 00:37.701
and because of all of this,

00:37.710 --> 00:39.496
-Ryn just went beast mode...
-[screams]

00:39.500 --> 00:41.536
...and how about the fact that
Ryn just did her thing to you,

00:41.540 --> 00:42.666
and you're acting
like it's nothing?

00:42.670 --> 00:44.456
[Ryn] Maddie is not okay.

00:44.460 --> 00:45.950
I mean, I'm sorry,

00:45.960 --> 00:47.370
but y'all need to get
your damn heads checked!

[Nicole, voice echoing]
Maddie?

01:03.830 --> 01:04.876
Maddie?

01:06.500 --> 01:07.615
Maddie?

01:09.790 --> 01:10.779
You okay?

01:12.580 --> 01:15.208
Sorry.
What was the question?

01:15.210 --> 01:17.030
Have you ever suffered
from delusions?

01:17.040 --> 01:18.166
Hallucinations?

01:18.170 --> 01:19.819
No, I haven't.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.491
I mean, not before this.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.876
Can I get some water?

01:22.880 --> 01:24.825
Yeah, of course.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.240
[door opens]

01:30.250 --> 01:31.615
How much longer?

01:33.460 --> 01:34.575
I'm not sure.

01:34.580 --> 01:35.956
I'll try to speed it along.

01:38.830 --> 01:40.878
Why they keep Maddie
there so long?

01:40.880 --> 01:42.780
Asking questions.

01:42.790 --> 01:45.452
They're trying to understand
what's going on inside her head.

01:45.460 --> 01:48.418
It's_ca|led _
a psychological evaluation.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.820
I see you're an only child.

01:53.830 --> 01:55.457
Raised mostly
by your stepfather.

01:57.120 --> 01:59.702
Your mother wasn't _
always your primary caregiver.

01:59.710 --> 02:01.996
It says here she attended

02:02.000 --> 02:04.992
-inpatient substance abuse
_ rehabilitation...
-[ticking grows louder]

02:05.000 --> 02:06.740
three separate times.

02:06.750 --> 02:09.287
[voice echoing] Do you think
those circumstances

02:09.290 --> 02:11.918
could've contributed
to your current difficulties?

02:11.920 --> 02:13.785
Excuse me?

02:13.790 --> 02:16.918
[normal sound] Often,
a child raised in a home

02:16.920 --> 02:18.569
with a history
of substance abuse

02:18.580 --> 02:20.411
displays a lack
of impulsivity control--

02:20.420 --> 02:22.320
Stop!

02:22.330 --> 02:24.742
You have no idea who I am
or what I've been through.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.786
Maddie, she just wants
to get the full picture

02:26.790 --> 02:29.532
of what this all means,
where your reactions stem from.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.747
You're not being
attacked here.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.536
You don't know me.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.666
You know what?
Screw this.

02:36.670 --> 02:37.955
Let me out of here.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.372
Maddie, please.
Let us help you.

02:40.380 --> 02:41.779
I want out!

02:48.620 --> 02:50.167
-Maddie--
-Don't.

02:54.420 --> 02:56.411
Maddie's not okay.

02:56.420 --> 02:58.536
You go through this, too?

02:58.540 --> 02:59.529
In your head?

02:59.540 --> 03:01.952
In a different way, yeah.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.575
Same feeling, though.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.786
Out of control.

03:09.540 --> 03:11.246
I help Ben and Maddie.

03:26.580 --> 03:27.990

[screaming]

03:32.670 --> 03:35.742
[high-pitched call]

03:42.880 --> 03:45.371
I tried searching online,

03:45.380 --> 03:48.998
but the paper's
digital archives
only went back so far.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.208
Is this is everything
from 1962?

03:52.210 --> 03:53.825
Yeah, anything
that predates the web

03:53.830 --> 03:54.990
will be found on this floor.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.490
Oh. Myself included.

03:56.500 --> 03:57.956
[laughs] Thanks.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.279
No worries.

04:10.460 --> 04:13.372
[mysterious music]

04:36.040 --> 04:37.996
[gasping]

04:41.250 --> 04:42.285
[Ben] How are you feeling?

04:42.290 --> 04:44.110
Myself again.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.201
It's like something
triggers me.

04:47.210 --> 04:50.282
I act out, and afterwards,
I'm aware of what I did,

04:50.290 --> 04:52.030
I just don't know
why I did it.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.246
I know what you mean.

04:53.250 --> 04:55.070
It's like another side
of you takes over.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.618
I'm sorry about what happened
at your parents' house.

04:58.620 --> 05:00.827
It's okay.

05:00.830 --> 05:03.537
That night, I thought
I saw Ryn on the road,

05:03.540 --> 05:05.417
but she wasn't there.

05:05.420 --> 05:08.207
And maybe there's
no fixing it-- the song.

05:08.210 --> 05:09.916
I mean,
what if this is it?

05:09.920 --> 05:10.955
Our new normal.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.609
We're gonna figure it out.

05:12.620 --> 05:14.030
We're gonna be all right

05:17.580 --> 05:18.615
Ryn.

05:18.620 --> 05:20.451
She is healer.

05:20.460 --> 05:21.825
She will help us.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.871

05:27.210 --> 05:29.576
-[Xander] Gotcha.
-[Nicole] This is too easy.

05:31.170 --> 05:32.205
Yaah!

05:32.210 --> 05:33.996
[Xander growls]

05:34.000 --> 05:36.207
Okay, fine, fine, fine.
All right.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.371
No pictures, please.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.996
Easy, easy, easy.
If that was Whack-a-Mole,

05:41.000 --> 05:42.536
I would have just
swept the floor with you.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.031
Okay. Whatever helps you
sleep at night, McClure.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.417
For the record, I was
more into Nintendo as a kid.

05:47.420 --> 05:48.956
You know, like
Super Mario Brothers,

05:48.960 --> 05:50.996
Donkey Kong,
Legends of Zelda.

05:51.000 --> 05:51.955
Sonic the Hedgehog.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.167
Okay, that was Sega,
not Nintendo.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.707
You're failing me, Martinez.
You're failing me.

05:56.710 --> 05:59.873
Well, it sounds like you had
a very active social life.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.029
Oh, you have no idea.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.997
My dad never let me
play video games.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.958
He thought they
"reduced academic achievement."

06:07.960 --> 06:09.746
Those were his words,
not mine.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.240
Okay, then how'd
you get so good then?

06:11.250 --> 06:12.490
Played them anyway.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.160
This feels good.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.455
What?

06:17.460 --> 06:20.076
This. You and me.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.037
It almost feels... normal.

06:25.460 --> 06:26.700
I know what you mean.

06:28.170 --> 06:29.706
I propose a toast.

06:29.710 --> 06:31.029
Hmm.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.871
To, um...

06:32.880 --> 06:36.168
To this, right here.

06:36.170 --> 06:37.535
To leaving all that crap
in the past.

06:37.540 --> 06:40.748
And, um, to honesty.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.706
To honesty.

06:47.380 --> 06:48.995
[Helen]
Did you know about this?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.570
Did you know it was arson?

06:50.580 --> 06:52.116
Don't you think
I would've mentioned it?

06:52.120 --> 06:54.372
This is all way
before my time, Helen.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.996
Well, did your father ever
say anything to you?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.958
You know as well as I do,
my father was never
a big sharer.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.110
Well, according to this,

07:02.120 --> 07:04.998
my parents were staying
in your family's cottage
the night of the fire.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.286
Why would your family
have been staying
in our cottage?

07:07.290 --> 07:09.372
Your guess
is as good as mine.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.075
But_this article
says it was arson,

07:11.080 --> 07:13.207
which means
my father was murdered.

07:13.210 --> 07:15.030
Are you suggesting my family
had something to do with that?

07:15.040 --> 07:16.826
I'm just stating the facts.

07:18.540 --> 07:19.950
[sighs]

07:22.080 --> 07:23.069
I'm sorry.

07:24.330 --> 07:25.957
"No suspects were identified.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.871
Motivation for the crime
remains unclear."

07:27.880 --> 07:29.609
Look, I'm sure that there is

07:29.620 --> 07:31.827
a perfectly logical
explanation for all this.

07:34.880 --> 07:38.702
[mysterious music]

07:51.250 --> 07:52.069

07:52.080 --> 07:53.911

08:35.170 --> 08:36.319
Can you help them?

08:36.330 --> 08:37.410
No.

08:37.420 --> 08:38.819
Too strong.

08:39.830 --> 08:40.819
In head.

08:50.170 --> 08:51.239
You know how.

08:52.250 --> 08:53.239
Tell me.

08:54.620 --> 08:57.498
Humans help us
get back in water.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.240
Now we must help humans.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.992
The song,
it hurt Ben and Maddie.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.537
Tell me how to help them.

09:04.540 --> 09:09.375
There is place
where sound heals.

09:09.380 --> 09:12.747
Ryn, what's
she talking about?

09:12.750 --> 09:16.493
There is place.
In the ocean.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.162
Secret place
where sound is kept.

09:20.580 --> 09:23.413
My mother tell me about it
when I was young.

09:23.420 --> 09:24.819
Have you been there?

09:24.830 --> 09:29.164
No. Only healers go.

09:29.170 --> 09:31.411
I tell you where.

09:34.330 --> 09:35.376
Humans cannot go.

Too deep in water.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.286
[dramatic music]

09:45.290 --> 09:47.827
[Kyle] Okay, let me
get this straight.

09:47.830 --> 09:51.823
You want to use
the Naw's resources
to investigate this, um...

09:51.830 --> 09:52.910
What'd you say it was?

09:52.920 --> 09:54.956
An oceanic sound source.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.575
From what Ryn told us,

09:56.580 --> 09:58.707
it seems to be some kind
of underwater echo chamber.

09:58.710 --> 10:00.109
And she believes going down
to this chamber

10:00.120 --> 10:02.168
might help
with the effects of this song?

10:02.170 --> 10:03.910
If we can get there, yes.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.377
You know
how far-fetched this sounds?

10:06.380 --> 10:07.824
[Ben] A few months ago,
I would've said

10:07.830 --> 10:09.286
the same thing
about mermaids.

10:09.290 --> 10:10.416
[scoffs]

10:12.000 --> 10:16.289
You know, when I was deployed
in Kuwait back in '91,

10:16.290 --> 10:19.373
my unit's motto was
"in God we trust.

10:20.790 --> 10:22.371
All others we monitor."

10:22.380 --> 10:24.416
Meaning what exactly?

10:24.420 --> 10:25.876
You're a civilian,
asking me to lend you

10:25.880 --> 10:28.610
multi-million_ dollar
research eqUIpment.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.451
Why should I put
my trust in you?

10:30.460 --> 10:33.327
Funny. I asked myself
the same thing about--

10:33.330 --> 10:34.786
It could be an opportunity

10:34.790 --> 10:36.371
to shed some more light
on the song, sir.

10:41.420 --> 10:44.241
Okay, but you're in charge.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.569
Yes, sir.

10:45.580 --> 10:47.070
Anything they see down there,
I want to see, too.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.911
-You understand me?
-Copy.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.287
And I want
this entire expedition
fully documented.

10:52.290 --> 10:53.370
[Nicole] Yes, sir.

10:59.330 --> 11:00.570
There.

11:00.580 --> 11:02.241
You see that?

11:02.250 --> 11:03.456
Wait.

11:05.170 --> 11:06.990
It looks like a person.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.072
A person in a place
impossible to reach
without gear.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.913
That's why they're sweeping
this whole eco-terror attack
under the rug.

11:12.920 --> 11:13.989
Who is?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.956
The military, man.

11:15.960 --> 11:19.248
I've been working at Klesco
for almost five years.

11:19.250 --> 11:20.706
Last year, they put
away a tree hugger

11:20.710 --> 11:22.917
just for taggin' a ship
with a peace sign.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.740
They don't just let things go.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.287
So you're telling me
the United States
military stepped in

11:29.170 --> 11:31.035
That's what I'm saying.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.280
Days after the attack,

11:32.290 --> 11:34.611
Feds came in
and swiped all the footage.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.036
Not all the footage.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.161

11:43.960 --> 11:45.825
[rock music
playing in The Anchor]

11:48.000 --> 11:49.285
That one still has
lipstick on it.

11:49.290 --> 11:51.611
Oh, yeah.
See, that's, um--

11:51.620 --> 11:53.451
That's actually my glass.

drinking from it yet.

Um, are you hungry?

I owe you an apology.

12:07.670 --> 12:11.458
What I did was
completely out of line.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.745
I was messed up.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.615
Because of the song, right?

12:14.620 --> 12:17.919
It lowered my inhibitions,
these old feelings came up,

12:17.920 --> 12:20.912
and you got caught
in the crossfire, Xan.

12:20.920 --> 12:21.909
I'm sorry.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.035

you're okay now, yeah?

Look, um, so your mom

12:45.460 --> 12:47.030

12:48.040 --> 12:50.531
And she says that

12:52.500 --> 12:55.742
you're in a relationship
with Ben and Ryn.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.576
Why would she
tell you that?

12:59.580 --> 13:01.320
She's worried about you.

13:01.330 --> 13:03.070
So am I.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.868
I mean, are you sure
that this thing
that's in your head,

13:06.880 --> 13:09.872
it's not making you
think that you have
feelings for Ryn?

13:09.880 --> 13:11.950
I mean, what if that's
not real either?

13:11.960 --> 13:13.530
I mean, you have
no idea what this thing
could be doing to you.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.952
I had feelings for her
before it happened.

13:15.960 --> 13:19.327
You know, you don't always need
to worry about me, Xander.

13:19.330 --> 13:20.957

I've met them, Beth.

I knew.

You're telling me
they're in Bristol Cove?

24:37.620 --> 24:39.281
We can't let them
see everything.

24:40.290 --> 24:41.416
They don't watch now?

24:41.420 --> 24:43.957
No, it's just us.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.700
Stop there.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.324

24:48.330 --> 24:49.615

[placid music]

26:34.500 --> 26:35.706
Incredible.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.450
What is this place?

26:48.460 --> 26:50.530
This is where Ryn began.

26:50.540 --> 26:51.746
Ryn, you were born here?

26:52.830 --> 26:53.819
Long ago.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.166
[Ben] This must be
their breeding ground.

26:57.170 --> 26:58.535
Where they come to mate.

26:58.540 --> 27:01.111
Yes. Mate again soon.

27:03.420 --> 27:04.660
Hey!

27:11.710 --> 27:13.416
You two know each other?

27:13.420 --> 27:14.455
Yes.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.826
She is family.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.746

-Ryn.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.701
We go.
To healing place.

28:00.710 --> 28:03.076
Yeah. Think
that's a good idea.

28:06.790 --> 28:08.200
That way.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.951
He was like Batman.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.245
One second
we're under attack.

28:22.250 --> 28:25.572
And next the second,
he swoops down from the slq

28:25.580 --> 28:27.036
and just cleans up shop.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.325
There was no swooping.

28:28.330 --> 28:30.207
Sounds like you were
luclq he was there.

28:30.210 --> 28:31.165
You could've
gotten really hurt.

28:31.170 --> 28:33.240
Oh, we got some punches in.

28:33.250 --> 28:35.878
Air shots don't count, babe.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.997
How about another plate of fries
for the man of the hour?

28:39.000 --> 28:40.035
Yes.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.372
You're paying
for that beer.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.166

I was just attacked!

here so much?

28:52.920 --> 28:54.876
I just don't get it.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.416
What's so great
about being on land?

28:56.420 --> 28:58.206
On land,

29:01.210 --> 29:02.450
I make choice.

29:05.880 --> 29:07.279
I get that.

29:07.290 --> 29:09.326
One more question.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.321
A song,
can you do that, too,

29:11.330 --> 29:13.878
or is it just,
like, a girl thing?

29:13.880 --> 29:15.279
I don't sing.

of your ancestors, Ryn.

What is "ancestors"?

31:29.420 --> 31:32.457

What are we
gonna do with him?

He's made it clear
he wants to stay.

32:25.080 --> 32:26.490
Fish wants to be free.

32:29.620 --> 32:30.609

Uh, no.

He can't stay
at my mom's.

32:37.960 --> 32:39.530
That'd be weird.

I think it's weird
you live with your mom.

if you were lost or dead.

after we hit the bottom.

malfunction with the sonar.

I'm the only one
in between you

33:10.790 --> 33:13.782
and this entire operation
being taken over?

33:13.790 --> 33:17.282
This pattern of you
not trusting me
is getting really old.

33:17.290 --> 33:18.746
What am I supposed
to tell my C.O.?

33:18.750 --> 33:22.959
Tell him that the mission
was a success.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.370
We got
what we were looking for.

33:26.460 --> 33:27.666

to remember that.

would've called first.

Then it wouldn't be
a surprise, Silly.

33:52.420 --> 33:54.661
So, this is your shop?

33:54.670 --> 33:57.616
I'm thrilled I finally
get to see it in person.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.417
It was my mother's.

33:59.420 --> 34:02.617
We collected these relics
together for years.

34:02.620 --> 34:05.418

used to bake together

34:05.420 --> 34:07.320

34:07.330 --> 34:08.536
That's her recipe.

_ We have a lot
in common, Helen.

34:13.330 --> 34:14.706
We value our roots.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.371
I suppose
you could say that.

34:18.380 --> 34:21.201
There aren't many
like us in the world.

34:21.210 --> 34:23.166
I think it's important
we try to trust each other.

34:25.040 --> 34:28.828
You're the one who had me
abducted in a parking lot.

34:28.830 --> 34:32.163
You, of all people, can
understand why we were afraid.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.377
Do you know
I have two boys?

34:35.540 --> 34:37.496
Max is eight,
Jake is six.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.746
If our secret ever got out,

34:40.750 --> 34:42.320
we'd be ripped apart.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.321
I hope you get that.

34:44.330 --> 34:48.744
I've been hiding
my entire life, Beth.

34:50.790 --> 34:51.916
I think I get it.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.997
What we need, you and I,
is a fresh start.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.571
-Some honesty.
-[laughs]

34:59.580 --> 35:02.822
Okay. Since
we're being honest,

35:02.830 --> 35:04.491
did your people
kill my father?

35:05.790 --> 35:07.166
What makes you ask that?

35:07.170 --> 35:09.821
I've been doing
some digging.

35:09.830 --> 35:11.536
I wouldn't even
have been born.

35:11.540 --> 35:15.954
I've heard stories
about your mother's
intermarriage,

35:15.960 --> 35:17.109
but that's all.

35:17.120 --> 35:20.499
So you knew
who I was all along?

35:20.500 --> 35:22.320
Who my parents were.

35:22.330 --> 35:26.243
Did you know I didn't even
get to meet my own father?

35:29.080 --> 35:31.321
So much for honesty.

35:33.170 --> 35:34.239
I should go.

35:34.250 --> 35:36.662
I think
that's a good idea.

36:18.460 --> 36:20.951
That's right, Ryn.
Not dark.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.786
I don't believe it.

36:23.790 --> 36:25.667
So you're telling us
it worked?

36:25.670 --> 36:26.955
I'm saying
the echo chamber removed

36:26.960 --> 36:28.780
a considerable
amount of the damage.

36:28.790 --> 36:31.247
There are remnants
along the frontal lobe,

36:31.250 --> 36:32.706
mostly benign lesions.

36:32.710 --> 36:35.247
Whatever you were
exposed to down there,

36:36.880 --> 36:37.915
it helped.

36:39.250 --> 36:40.820
Oh, my God.

36:43.170 --> 36:44.660
You are okay?

36:44.670 --> 36:47.116
Yes, we're okay.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.202
We'll give
you three some privacy.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.826
I'm handing over
the recording to the techs.

36:53.830 --> 36:55.457
They'll start
their analysis in the morning.

36:55.460 --> 36:57.451
If this can help
keep you safe,

36:57.460 --> 36:59.371
maybe we can continue
helping your mom
with her treatment.

37:00.380 --> 37:02.280

37:15.170 --> 37:17.707
One, two, three.

37:17.710 --> 37:19.371
Good.
Now back to center.

37:19.380 --> 37:22.952
Okay, hold. One, two, three.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.370
Good.

37:24.380 --> 37:26.280
Okay. I think
that's it for today, Ava.

37:26.290 --> 37:28.281
-Thank you.
-I'll see you Wednesday.

37:28.290 --> 37:29.609
Sounds good.

37:33.420 --> 37:35.786
Every day, it's
getting a little easier.

37:35.790 --> 37:37.781
This new treatment
has re-energized me.

37:37.790 --> 37:39.417
I feel better
than I did before.

37:39.420 --> 37:40.956
That's terrific, honey.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.029
What's that?

37:43.210 --> 37:45.326
I found these in the attic.

37:45.330 --> 37:48.993
They're letters exchanged
between my grandmother
and Helen's mother.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.117
What on earth did they
have to say to each other?

37:52.120 --> 37:55.374
Well, apparently Helen's mother
was in some kind of trouble.

37:55.380 --> 37:57.746
She was pregnant,
didn't know where to go.

37:57.750 --> 38:00.162
She sought out my grandmother,
looking for a place to hide.

38:01.420 --> 38:02.535
The cottage.

38:02.540 --> 38:05.077
They lived here?

38:08.210 --> 38:12.249
It's hard to imagine
the Pownalls and the Hawkins
ever being that close.

38:12.250 --> 38:14.286
Does it say
what she was hiding from?

38:15.290 --> 38:16.279
No.

shut off the lights,

38:44.290 --> 38:46.281
You reached out to me
a few weeks ago.

38:46.290 --> 38:48.326
Yeah. I remember.

38:48.330 --> 38:50.116
Yeah, look, I know
this is out of the blue,

38:50.120 --> 38:52.418
but I was hoping I could
take a look at that, uh--

38:52.420 --> 38:53.284
the video you showed me.

38:53.290 --> 38:54.575
The one from the boat?

38:54.580 --> 38:56.241
What, you believe me now?

38:56.250 --> 38:59.117
I'm following up on a lead.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.951
I think I'm ready to hear
what you have to say about...
