00:07.757 --> 00:10.509
This is unbelievable.
It's been half an hour.

00:10.719 --> 00:14.221
If this was a cartoon, you'd be
looking like a ham right about now.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.347
There's the waitress.
Excuse me, miss.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.018
- Hello, miss?
- It's Phoebe.

00:19.269 --> 00:21.937
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.647
Okay, will that be all?

00:24.524 --> 00:26.817
Wait, wait.
What are you doing here?

00:27.152 --> 00:28.318
Yeah, um, I was over there...

00:28.570 --> 00:31.196
...then you said, "Excuse me, miss."
So now I'm here.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.199
No, no. How come you're working here?

00:34.534 --> 00:38.537
Right. Because it's close to where I live,
and the aprons are really cute.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.122
Can we start over?

00:40.331 --> 00:42.791
- Yeah. Okay, great. I'll be over here.
- No, no, no, no.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.969
I don't know whether he's testing me
or just acting out...

01:36.179 --> 01:38.806
...but my monkey is out of control.

01:40.683 --> 01:44.019
He keeps erasing
the messages on my machine.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.522
Supposedly by accident.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.857
Oh, yeah, I've done that.

01:52.153 --> 01:55.739
And three days in a row, he got
to the newspaper before I did...

01:55.990 --> 01:58.200
...and peed all over the crossword.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.828
I've never done that.

02:01.996 --> 02:04.998
Now tell me she doesn't look
exactly like her sister.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.626
I'm saying I see a difference.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.044
They're twins.

02:09.294 --> 02:12.840
I don't care.
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot.

02:14.425 --> 02:17.177
You know that thing
when we talk about things?

02:17.428 --> 02:19.888
- Let's not do that anymore.
- Okay.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.099
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.560
Hey, Pheebs.
Guess who we saw today.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.395
Ooh. Oh, fun. Okay.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.272
- Um, Liam Neeson.
- No.

02:28.481 --> 02:29.940
- Morley Safer.
- Nope.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.817
- The woman who cuts my hair.
- No.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.111
Look, this could be a really long game.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.571
Your sister, Ursula.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.239
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.199
She works at that place, uh...

02:39.409 --> 02:40.534
Riff's. Yeah, I know.

02:40.785 --> 02:43.537
Oh, you do? She said you guys
haven't talked in years.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.164
Hmm? Yeah.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.918
So, um, is she fat?

02:52.088 --> 02:54.298
Not from where I was standing.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.300
Where were you standing?

02:59.137 --> 03:02.222
Uh, Pheebs, so you guys
just don't get along?

03:02.807 --> 03:05.350
It's mostly just dumb
sister stuff, you know?

03:05.602 --> 03:08.770
Everyone always thought of her
as the pretty one.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.357
Oh. Oh. She was the first to walk...

03:12.609 --> 03:15.485
...even though I did it
later that same day.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.991
To my parents, by then it was,
"Yeah, what else is new?"

03:21.409 --> 03:22.451
Oh.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.621
Pheebs, I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
I've got Lamaze class.

03:25.830 --> 03:29.124
Oh, and I've got earth science,
but I'll catch you in gym?

03:32.253 --> 03:34.338
So is this just gonna be you and Carol?

03:34.589 --> 03:36.256
No. Susan will be there too.

03:36.507 --> 03:40.802
We've got dads. We've got lesbians.
The whole parenting team.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.180
Well, isn't that gonna be weird?

03:43.556 --> 03:45.515
No. It might have been at first...

03:45.767 --> 03:48.310
...but now I'm comfortable
with the situation.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.812
- Ross, that's my jacket.
- I know.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.240
Hi. We're the Rostens.

04:01.449 --> 04:04.201
I'm J.C. And he's Michael.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.454
And we're having a boy and a girl.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.832
Good for you.
Alrighty, next?

04:12.335 --> 04:14.503
Hi. Um, I'm, uh... Ahem.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.088
I'm Ross Geller.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.589
And, uh, that's my boy in there.

04:18.841 --> 04:23.553
And, uh, this is Carol Willick,
and this is Susan Bunch.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.182
Susan is, um, Carol's...

04:33.147 --> 04:34.398
Who's next?

04:36.526 --> 04:37.818
I'm sorry, Susan is?

04:38.027 --> 04:40.195
- Susan is Carol's friend.
- Life partner.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.114
Like buddies.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.324
Like lovers.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.493
You know how close women can get.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.289
- Susan and I live together.
- I was married to her.

04:50.498 --> 04:53.208
- Carol. Not me.
- It's a little complicated.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.793
- But we're fine.
- Absolutely.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.171
So, twins. Ha.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.756
That's like two births.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.511
Ouch.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.561
To you too, Helen.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.939
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.191
Oh. Okay, send her in.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.739
Hi.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.199
- Hi, Nina. Come on in.
- You wanted to see me?

05:26.367 --> 05:29.077
Uh, yes.
Uh, I was just going over your data.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.747
You've been postdating
your Friday numbers.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.999
Which is bad, because?

05:34.208 --> 05:36.084
- Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
- Ha, ha.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.295
Excuse me?

05:39.005 --> 05:40.213
WENUS. Ahem.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.632
- Weekly Estimated...
- Oh, Net Usage Statistics.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.718
Right. Gotcha, gotcha.

05:44.927 --> 05:48.847
Won't happen again. I wouldn't
want to do anything to hurt your...

05:49.057 --> 05:50.182
...WENUS.

06:00.902 --> 06:04.071
It's not just that she's cute, okay?
It's just that...

06:04.322 --> 06:06.573
...she's really, really cute.

06:07.033 --> 06:11.161
It doesn't matter. You don't dip
your pen in the company ink.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.123
Ross.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.834
Your little creature's
got the remote again.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.671
Marcel. Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.174
Marcel.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.678
Marcel, you give Rossy
the remote right now.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.308
You give Rossy the remote...

06:34.894 --> 06:37.437
- Great.
- Relax. I'll fix it.

06:39.774 --> 06:44.736
Oh, cool. Urkel in Spanish is Urkel.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.907
How did he do this?

06:49.951 --> 06:52.202
So tell me,
is leaving the Christmas lights up...

06:52.412 --> 06:54.996
...part of your plan to keep us merry
all year long?

06:55.206 --> 06:58.417
No, someone was supposed to take
them down around New Year's...

06:58.668 --> 07:00.419
...but obviously someone forgot.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.338
Well, someone was supposed to write:

07:03.548 --> 07:07.467
"Rach, take down the lights,"
and put it on the refrigera...

07:09.762 --> 07:11.638
How long has that been there?

07:13.182 --> 07:14.224
Hey, where you been?

07:14.809 --> 07:18.353
I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula
likes me. All I ordered was coffee.

07:18.604 --> 07:22.274
She brought me a tuna melt
and four plates of curly fries.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.610
Score.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.781
She is so hot.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.534
Listen, okay, before you do
anything Joey-like...

07:32.785 --> 07:35.036
...you might want to run it by, uh...

07:36.789 --> 07:37.831
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.125
- Pheebs?
- Yeah?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.836
Would it be okay
if I asked out your sister?

07:43.212 --> 07:46.256
Why? Why would you
want to do that? Why?

07:47.508 --> 07:50.510
So that if we went out on a date,
she'd be there.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.894
Well, I mean, I'm not
my sister's, you know...

07:59.145 --> 08:01.271
...whatever. And, um...

08:02.315 --> 08:05.442
I mean, it's true,
we were one egg once.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.778
But, you know,
we've grown apart, so, um...

08:09.030 --> 08:10.739
I don't know. Why not?

08:11.115 --> 08:12.365
Cool. Thanks.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.245
You okay?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.997
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.791
Do you wanna watch
Laverne y Shirley?

08:37.725 --> 08:38.808
Sorry.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.309
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.812
Sorry I'm late.
Uh, where's Carol?

08:43.063 --> 08:46.233
Stuck at school.
Some parent-teacher thing.

08:46.484 --> 08:49.110
You can go.
I'll get the information.

08:49.946 --> 08:54.533
No, no, ahem, I think I should stay.
We should both know what's going on.

08:54.742 --> 08:55.951
Oh, good.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.619
This will be fun.

08:57.828 --> 09:02.332
Alrighty. We're gonna start with some basic
third-stage breathing exercises.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.292
Mommies, get on your back.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.421
And, coaches, you should be
supporting Mommy's head.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.388
- What?
- What?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.348
I'm supposed to be the mommy?

09:18.558 --> 09:21.977
Okay, I'm gonna play
my sperm card one more time.

09:23.854 --> 09:27.691
I don't see why I have to miss out on the
coaching training because I'm a woman.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.693
I see. So, what do you propose to do?

09:29.944 --> 09:32.195
- I'll flip you for it.
- Flip me for it? No, no, no.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.947
Heads, heads, heads.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.616
On your back, Mom.

09:40.621 --> 09:44.708
All right, mommies,
take a nice, deep, cleansing breath.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.170
Good.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.299
Now imagine your vagina is opening...

09:52.508 --> 09:54.509
...like a flower.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.314
Mr. Dee. How's it going, sir?

10:07.523 --> 10:08.815
Uh, it's been better.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.901
The Annual Net Usage
Statistics are in.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.738
- And?
- It's pretty ugly.

10:14.947 --> 10:18.283
We haven't seen an ANUS
this bad since the '70s.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.204
- So, what does this mean?
- We're gonna be laying off people.

10:23.664 --> 10:27.417
Listen, I know I came in late last week.
I slept funny and my hair was snarly.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.918
Not you.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.795
Relax.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.549
Ever have to fire anyone?

10:36.093 --> 10:37.135
Nina...

10:39.347 --> 10:43.767
Nina.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.686
Nina...

10:47.563 --> 10:49.230
Are you okay?

10:50.274 --> 10:51.816
Yes. Yes, I am.

10:53.194 --> 10:57.697
Uh, listen, the reason that
I called you in here today was, uh...

10:58.324 --> 10:59.783
Please don't hate me.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.451
What?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.997
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

11:11.253 --> 11:13.755
So, Pheebs, what do you want
for your birthday?

11:14.256 --> 11:18.468
Well, what I really want is for my mom
to be alive and enjoy it with me.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.390
Okay.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.727
Let me put it this way.
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?

11:27.937 --> 11:30.855
- Bath salts would be nice.
- Oh, okay. Good.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.116
What is this place?

11:41.367 --> 11:44.035
Look, you're cold, I have to pee,
and there's coffee.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.079
How bad could it be?

11:46.372 --> 11:48.373
I think we have an answer.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.292
What's she doing here?

11:51.544 --> 11:54.838
This could be God's way
of telling us to eat at home.

11:55.464 --> 11:59.384
- Think she got fired at Riff's?
- No, we were there last night.

11:59.593 --> 12:02.262
She kept bringing swordfish.
Are you gonna go?

12:02.513 --> 12:04.681
I'll wait until we order.
It's her, right?

12:04.932 --> 12:06.641
It looks like her.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.436
- Um, excuse me?
- Yeah?

12:10.146 --> 12:11.604
Hi, it's us.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.569
Right. And it's me.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.614
So you're here too?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.825
As much as you are.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.493
Your turn.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.038
- We know what we want.
- Oh, that's good.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.834
- All we want is two caffe lattes.
- And some biscotti cookies.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.669
Good choice.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.508
- It's definitely her.
- Yeah.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.603
I can't believe you.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.939
You still haven't told that girl
she doesn't have a job yet?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.651
Well, you still haven't taken down
the Christmas lights.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.364
Congratulations. I think you found
the world's thinnest argument.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.992
I'm just trying to find the right moment.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.287
Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard,
now that you're dating.

13:10.706 --> 13:15.043
"Sweetheart, you're fired. But how
about a quickie before I go to work?"

13:18.672 --> 13:19.798
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:22.718 --> 13:25.970
Once you're inside,
you don't have to knock anymore.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.681
I'll get it.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.895
Oh. Hi, Mr. Heckles.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.522
You're doing it again.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.232
We're not doing anything.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.568
We're just sitting around
talking quietly.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.862
I can hear you through the ceiling.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.825
My cats can't sleep.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.245
You don't even have cats.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.372
I could have cats.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.124
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.877
We'll try to keep it down.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.759
Phoebe, can you do me a favor?

14:05.135 --> 14:07.011
Try this on to make sure it fits.

14:07.221 --> 14:11.140
Oh, my first birthday present.
Oh, this is really...

14:11.392 --> 14:14.602
Oh, no, no. It's for Ursula.
I just figured, you know, size-wise.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.898
Oh. Sure. Yeah.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.483
Okay, it fits.

14:22.862 --> 14:26.489
- Are you seeing her again tonight?
- Yep, Ice Capades.

14:26.740 --> 14:27.949
Wow, this is serious.

14:28.158 --> 14:31.452
I've never known you to pay money
for any kind of capade.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.456
I don't know. I like her.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.043
She's different.
There's, uh, something about her...

14:39.253 --> 14:41.546
That you like.
We get it. You like her. Great.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.092
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you,
and you said it was okay.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.219
Well, maybe now it's not okay.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.804
Okay.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.057
Well, maybe now I'm not okay
with it not being okay.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.392
Okay.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.316
Knit, good woman.
Knit. Knit.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.456
And that's the Chrysler Building
right there.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.832
Oh.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.877
- Nina.
- Mr. Douglas.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.420
Cool tie.

15:25.883 --> 15:26.925
She's still here.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.844
Yes. Yes, she is.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.638
Didn't I memo you on this?

15:31.889 --> 15:36.768
See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call
from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen...

15:37.019 --> 15:38.561
...Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.

15:40.105 --> 15:44.025
And, uh, he informed me that
she took the news rather badly.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.986
In fact, he, uh, mentioned
the word "frenzy."

15:47.947 --> 15:49.280
You're kidding. She seems so...

15:49.490 --> 15:50.949
Oh, no, no. Nina? She's:

15:53.369 --> 15:55.495
In fact, if you asked her now...

15:55.704 --> 15:58.623
...she'd have no recollection
of being fired at all.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.084
That's unbelievable.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.961
And yet believable.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.713
So I decided not to fire her again...

16:05.923 --> 16:09.300
...until I'm sure she will be
of no threat to herself or others.

16:10.177 --> 16:14.472
I see. Hmm. You never really know
what's going on inside a person's head.

16:15.057 --> 16:18.643
Well, I guess that's why
they call it psychology, sir.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.482
The sound Mom and Dad will never forget.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.944
For this, after all,
is the miracle of birth.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.487
Lights, please.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.197
And that's having a baby.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.658
Next week is our final class.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.786
Susan, go deep.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.085
It's impossible. It's just impossible.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.378
What is, honey?

16:45.629 --> 16:47.463
What that woman...

16:47.673 --> 16:48.715
...did.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.427
I am not doing that. Heh.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.805
It'll have to stay in, that's all.
Everything will be the same.

16:56.056 --> 16:59.058
- It'll just stay in. Ha, ha.
- Carol, honey. Shh.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.936
- Everything will be all right.
- What do you know?

17:02.146 --> 17:04.981
No one's saying to you,
"Hi, is that your nostril?

17:05.232 --> 17:07.733
Mind if we push
this pot roast through it?"

17:08.986 --> 17:10.569
Carol, sweetie.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.238
Cleansing breath.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.659
I know it's frightening.
But big picture:

17:16.910 --> 17:19.287
The birth part is just one day...

17:19.704 --> 17:23.875
...and when it's over, we'll all
be parents for the rest of our lives.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.045
I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

17:27.296 --> 17:28.337
Ross?

17:29.465 --> 17:30.506
Ross.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.259
I'm gonna be a father.

17:34.428 --> 17:37.722
- This is just occurring to you?
- I always knew I was having a baby.

17:37.931 --> 17:41.225
I just never realized
the baby was having me.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.561
Oh, you're gonna be great.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.188
How could you say that?

17:45.397 --> 17:48.524
I can't even get Marcel
to stop eating the bathmat.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.610
How will I raise a kid?

17:51.111 --> 17:53.362
You know, Ross, some scientists
are now saying...

17:53.614 --> 17:56.657
...that monkeys and babies
are actually different.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.245
- Where are you going?
- Out.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.914
With?

18:03.290 --> 18:04.373
Yes.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.793
All right, can I just ask you one question?

18:08.295 --> 18:11.255
Have you two, you know,
like, you know?

18:12.883 --> 18:13.966
You know?

18:14.927 --> 18:15.968
Yet?

18:16.845 --> 18:18.805
Well, not that it's any
of your business...

18:19.056 --> 18:20.765
...but no, we haven't, okay?

18:26.480 --> 18:28.564
You meant sex, right?

18:37.074 --> 18:39.867
- Do you have a sec?
- Uh, sure, Nina. What's up?

18:40.452 --> 18:43.663
I don't know. For the past couple days,
people have been avoiding me...

18:43.872 --> 18:45.832
...and giving me
these really strange looks.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.960
Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because...

18:49.128 --> 18:52.255
...they're, uh, jealous of us.

18:52.631 --> 18:53.965
Maybe.

18:54.174 --> 18:57.343
But that doesn't explain why
they keep taking my scissors.

18:58.262 --> 19:02.098
Uh, well, maybe that's, uh,
because you're getting a big raise.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.560
- I am?
- Sure. Why not?

19:05.853 --> 19:08.813
Oh, my God. You're amazing.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.315
Oh, you don't know.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.611
Helen, make sure we put through the
paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.907
Still want her
psychological profile sent to personnel?

19:20.075 --> 19:22.994
- What?
- Helen drinks.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.496
Will you marry me?

19:32.087 --> 19:34.922
- Well, I ended up telling her everything.
- Ooh. How'd she take it?

19:35.340 --> 19:38.217
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.

19:38.635 --> 19:41.721
Little tip. If you're ever
in a similar situation...

19:41.930 --> 19:44.682
...never, ever leave
your hand on the desk.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.853
Okay, I think I get how to do this.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.777
Can we turn this off?
Can we make them go away?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.863
Because I can't watch.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.948
- Okay, Pheebs, they're gone.
- Okay.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.409
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

20:03.619 --> 20:07.538
It's just, you know,
this whole stupid Ursula thing.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.332
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask?

20:09.583 --> 20:12.835
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

20:13.045 --> 20:14.420
Um, yeah.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.342
I mean, I'm not saying
she's evil or anything.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.428
She's just, you know,
always breaking my stuff.

20:23.347 --> 20:26.641
When I was 8, I wouldn't let her
have my Judy Jetson Thermos...

20:26.850 --> 20:28.893
...so she threw it under the bus.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.604
And then there's Randy Brown...

20:31.813 --> 20:33.272
...who was like...

20:33.732 --> 20:36.651
Have you ever had a boyfriend
who was like your best friend?

20:37.611 --> 20:38.861
- No.
- No.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.907
Well, but that's what he was for me.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.618
And she, you know,
kind of stole him away...

20:45.869 --> 20:48.704
...and then broke his heart.

20:49.539 --> 20:52.166
And then he wouldn't
even talk to me anymore.

20:52.417 --> 20:56.671
He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.174
Oh, Pheebs.

21:00.592 --> 21:04.762
I mean, I know Joey's not
my boyfriend or my Thermos...

21:05.847 --> 21:07.265
...or anything, but...

21:07.516 --> 21:10.268
- You won't lose him.
- You gotta talk to Joey.

21:10.769 --> 21:11.811
Yeah, okay.

21:12.020 --> 21:15.147
Come on. He doesn't know this stuff.
If he knew how you felt...

21:15.357 --> 21:16.983
He's falling in love with her.

21:17.192 --> 21:19.193
Oh, please.
They've been going out a week.

21:19.444 --> 21:23.739
They haven't even slept together yet.
I mean, that's not serious.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.244
Okay.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.706
Oh. Okay. Oh.

21:47.931 --> 21:48.973
Oh.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.727
Yeah, um, may we help you?

22:07.451 --> 22:10.786
Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing.
Would you come inside?

22:10.996 --> 22:12.830
No, no, no.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.750
You wanted me to take them down...

22:15.959 --> 22:18.544
...so I'm taking them down, okay?

22:20.589 --> 22:23.257
Rachel!

22:23.425 --> 22:25.551
I'm okay. I'm okay.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.928
Mr. Heckles?

22:28.847 --> 22:31.599
Mr. Heckles,
could you help me, please?

22:32.768 --> 22:35.978
See, this is just the kind of thing
I was talking about.
