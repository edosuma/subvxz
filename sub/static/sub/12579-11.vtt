[Singing] Someone's got a birthday,
I wonder who

00:36.957 --> 00:40.290
Someone's got a birthday, I wonder who

00:40.393 --> 00:43.453
What do you think of the car, Hank?
It's a convertible.

00:43.563 --> 00:46.589
Nothing says road trip like a convertible.

00:46.700 --> 00:49.533
Except for a kite.

00:49.636 --> 00:53.436
I can't just leave work 10 minutes early
on a Friday afternoon.

00:53.540 --> 00:54.768
Come on, Hank.

00:54.874 --> 00:57.468
You promised
if I couldn't find a date for my birthday...

00:57.577 --> 01:00.102
you, Dale, and Boomhauer
would be my dates.

01:00.213 --> 01:01.202
No, I didn't.

01:01.314 --> 01:03.578
I said we'd all go to Austin
for the weekend.

01:03.683 --> 01:05.878
Let's go! Let's get there.

01:05.986 --> 01:10.047
I have a job as
Assistant Manager of Strickland Propane.

01:10.156 --> 01:14.991
My day begins at 9:00 and ends at 5:00,
not 4:50.

01:18.164 --> 01:21.622
[Singing] Someone's got a birthday,
I wonder who

01:31.111 --> 01:34.945
Someone's got a birthday, I wonder who

01:35.115 --> 01:38.846
Someone's got a birthday, I wonder who

01:39.219 --> 01:42.848
Someone's got a birthday, I wonder who

01:43.289 --> 01:44.688
Someone's got a birthday

01:48.428 --> 01:52.922
Welcome to my end-of-semester party.
I never thought finals would be over.

01:53.033 --> 01:56.833
But by this time next week, they will be.

01:59.172 --> 02:03.871
Little plastic swords instead of toothpicks.
Very British.

02:07.881 --> 02:11.817
This is the most delicious burger
that I have ever eaten.

02:11.918 --> 02:13.249
Thanks a lot, Mom.

02:13.353 --> 02:17.517
You've built it up so much,
there's no way that burger can be that...

02:19.726 --> 02:21.353
Delicious!

02:24.731 --> 02:27.165
[Pop music playing on car stereo]

02:35.775 --> 02:39.506
You see?
That's why you don't fly a kite in a car.

02:39.612 --> 02:41.637
Who minds if I take off my shirt?

02:41.748 --> 02:43.409
- I do.
- Not me.

02:43.516 --> 02:45.711
Let's all switch shirts.

02:46.252 --> 02:47.446
[Car tires screeching]

02:47.554 --> 02:48.851
Dale!

02:48.955 --> 02:53.722
Hank, if you're steering,
who's taking off your shirt?

02:55.762 --> 02:59.095
Luanne, you ran out of burgers
and I think I know why.

02:59.199 --> 03:01.326
They are delicious and we ate them all.

03:01.434 --> 03:04.198
No problem. I'll just grill up some more.

03:07.373 --> 03:08.670
Charcoal?

03:13.613 --> 03:18.141
Maybe no one's ever taken the time
to tell Dad how much better charcoal is.

03:18.251 --> 03:21.345
And no one ever will.
Now, strip off your clothes...

03:21.454 --> 03:24.014
put them in the washer
and throw in some fish sticks.

03:24.124 --> 03:26.922
Your father has got a nose
like a Doberman.

03:40.540 --> 03:42.508
I know this hotel.

03:42.609 --> 03:45.510
It's where Lenore and I
spent our honeymoon.

03:46.713 --> 03:48.908
That's the couch where I slept.

03:51.151 --> 03:53.949
Hello. I am Gribble of the Gribble party.

03:54.053 --> 03:57.648
We requested four standard rooms
on your kosher floor.

03:57.757 --> 03:59.816
I'm sorry, sir.
We don't have a kosher floor.

03:59.926 --> 04:03.589
This is an outrage.
How do you intend to placate me?

04:03.696 --> 04:05.095
Would you knock it off, Dale?

04:05.198 --> 04:09.635
Wait till my pastor hears about this.
My God is a vengeful God.

04:09.736 --> 04:12.637
Sir, please,
we don't discriminate against...

04:12.739 --> 04:13.899
whatever you are.

04:14.007 --> 04:16.168
I'm sure there's some way
we can accommodate you.

04:16.276 --> 04:18.141
How about a suite on the club floor?

04:18.244 --> 04:21.303
- I'll see if one's available.
- I'll need four keys.

04:21.414 --> 04:24.212
Make that three keys.
I'll take the standard room.

04:24.317 --> 04:26.979
One key, one shampoo,
and no conditioner.

04:27.086 --> 04:30.055
Don't mind him.
He's with the schoolmarm convention.

04:40.266 --> 04:41.392
[Telephone ringing]

04:41.835 --> 04:44.668
HANK: Hank Hill.
BILL: Please hold for Dale Gribble.

04:46.573 --> 04:49.440
Hank, we're making a fort
out of all our furniture.

04:49.542 --> 04:50.566
Come on up.

04:50.677 --> 04:52.770
Wouldn't you guys rather grab a bite?

04:52.879 --> 04:54.972
You know,
according to the hotel magazine...

04:55.081 --> 04:58.312
the lobby restaurant
makes the best fajitas in town.

04:58.418 --> 04:59.908
Not interested.

05:06.392 --> 05:08.917
Now, when your father asks us
what we did while he was gone...

05:09.028 --> 05:11.997
we can say we got new tires for the car.

05:12.098 --> 05:14.794
- And it will be true.
- Mom.

05:16.169 --> 05:20.367
"Free with purchase
of 100-pound bag of charcoal."

05:33.186 --> 05:34.949
Hank, there you are.

05:35.722 --> 05:40.489
Hey, guys, wanna go hear Jerry Thomas
play piano at the Starlight Lounge?

05:40.593 --> 05:42.993
The gal at the front desk said
he was good.

05:43.096 --> 05:45.428
We just saw him. He is good.

05:46.566 --> 05:47.555
Come on, Hank...

05:47.667 --> 05:50.261
let's go moon the lobby
from the glass elevators.

05:50.370 --> 05:53.066
We are at this hotel as guests.

05:53.339 --> 05:55.705
My God, Hank.

05:55.808 --> 05:58.606
Can we ever have a party you don't poop?

05:58.711 --> 06:02.306
You still owe me one from high school
when the whole team mooned Belton...

06:02.415 --> 06:05.612
and you just held up a sign saying,
"Good game."

06:05.718 --> 06:10.280
It was the single greatest time
I have ever had with my pants off.

06:10.390 --> 06:14.258
The vice principal gave you
a week's detention for that stunt.

06:14.360 --> 06:18.660
Nobody remembers the detention, Hank.
Everyone remembers the mooning.

06:18.765 --> 06:22.030
Except for you,
because you weren't part of it. Let's go!

06:26.806 --> 06:29.969
- Hey, wait for me.
- Hank, you made it!

06:30.076 --> 06:32.670
Mind if I butt in, birthday boy?

06:32.779 --> 06:36.215
Okay, let's go. Big smile, lots of energy.

06:37.784 --> 06:38.842
Going up...

06:38.952 --> 06:40.920
and going down.

06:42.889 --> 06:45.016
Drop them in five, four...

06:45.124 --> 06:47.718
three, two and...

06:48.828 --> 06:52.855
DALE: Yeah! Shake your booty!

06:52.966 --> 06:56.868
I'm doing it. I'm a mooner. I'm part of it.

06:57.704 --> 07:00.332
Which is why Meals On Wheels
is proud to honor...

07:00.440 --> 07:05.309
the former Governor of Texas,
the Honorable Ann Richards.

07:13.319 --> 07:14.980
[Hank screaming]

07:22.795 --> 07:24.820
I'm gonna kick your asses.

07:24.931 --> 07:27.832
Why is it always
about asses with you, Hank?

07:29.202 --> 07:31.727
- Security. Open up.
- The fort.

07:35.808 --> 07:37.173
[Dale shushing]

07:39.445 --> 07:42.073
All right, which one of you guys
mooned the Governor?

07:42.181 --> 07:45.207
Perhaps you are unaware
this is the club floor.

07:45.318 --> 07:47.843
I believe we have certain immunities.

07:47.954 --> 07:52.391
Sir, I officially resign my room,
effective immediately.

07:52.492 --> 07:54.551
No, Hank, I'm the one who mooned.

07:54.660 --> 07:57.220
- Bill.
- Let me take the fall for you, Hank.

07:57.330 --> 07:59.457
I don't have as far to drop.

08:10.943 --> 08:12.103
Governor Richards.

08:12.211 --> 08:15.510
Sgt. Barber William Fontaine
Delatur Dauterive, ma'am, sir.

08:15.615 --> 08:17.082
At ease, Sergeant.

08:17.183 --> 08:19.777
Why, may I ask, did you moon me?

08:19.886 --> 08:23.219
Why, I wasn't mooning
anything in particular, you know.

08:23.322 --> 08:27.588
It's my birthday and you were
just a civilian caught in the crossfire.

08:28.561 --> 08:30.392
I'll tell you a little secret, Bill.

08:30.496 --> 08:33.226
I had a teacher once
that served during World War II...

08:33.332 --> 08:34.890
and he mooned Eleanor Roosevelt.

08:35.001 --> 08:36.467
- No!
- Yeah.

08:36.568 --> 08:38.832
He had the opportunity and he took it.

08:40.673 --> 08:42.140
I wouldn't be surprised...

08:42.241 --> 08:45.506
to find out charcoal is better
to heat your house with, too.

08:45.611 --> 08:46.805
[Telephone ringing]

08:47.613 --> 08:49.410
PEGGY: Hello?
HANK: Hi, it's me.

08:51.484 --> 08:54.453
Something's come up
that I'm not very proud of.

08:54.554 --> 08:56.818
And, well, we're being kicked out
of the hotel...

08:56.923 --> 08:59.721
so I'll be back a little earlier than planned.

08:59.826 --> 09:03.421
Okay, I cannot wait to see you. I love you.

09:03.529 --> 09:05.121
He is on his way.

09:09.335 --> 09:11.860
Oh, Bill, we were worried sick about you.

09:11.971 --> 09:13.495
ANN: Don't worry about Bill.

09:13.673 --> 09:16.233
I commuted his sentence
to dinner for two.

09:16.342 --> 09:18.469
Oh, my God, Governor Richards.

09:18.578 --> 09:21.809
Governor Richards. It's been a while.

09:21.914 --> 09:25.816
You may not remember me,
but I've seen you on TV.

09:49.509 --> 09:51.841
Okay, let's clear the air.

09:51.944 --> 09:53.775
What I did to the Governor...

09:53.880 --> 09:56.644
with my bottom was wrong.

09:56.749 --> 09:58.614
I hope you can forgive me.

09:58.718 --> 10:00.549
Of course I forgive you, honey.

10:00.653 --> 10:03.247
As I know that you would forgive me...

10:03.356 --> 10:06.757
if I ever lost my head
and did something crazy.

10:07.660 --> 10:10.026
I mean, not crazy like kill you with an ax...

10:10.129 --> 10:13.496
but, you know, like a little smaller crazy.

10:14.634 --> 10:16.932
Bobby, what are you doing to that steak?

10:17.036 --> 10:18.936
It's a little bland.

10:19.038 --> 10:21.529
I cooked it the way I always cook it.

10:21.641 --> 10:22.835
I know.

10:28.648 --> 10:29.615
Yup.

10:29.815 --> 10:30.782
Yep.

10:35.955 --> 10:39.584
See you at 7:00.
Hope you can dance as good as you bowl.

10:46.199 --> 10:47.257
Yup.

10:49.302 --> 10:51.395
What the hell is going on?

10:51.504 --> 10:54.871
What? Is it so weird
that I'm dating the Governor?

10:56.008 --> 10:57.407
A little bit, maybe.

10:57.510 --> 10:58.738
Did you get up her shirt?

10:58.844 --> 11:00.641
No, I should say not.

11:01.380 --> 11:04.110
Well, she's taking me to a fancy ball.

11:04.217 --> 11:06.208
I should probably shower.

11:08.187 --> 11:11.418
Well, it's nuts,
but she does have him showering.

11:14.827 --> 11:18.695
Man, that Phil Gramm
sure is a horse's ass.

11:18.798 --> 11:22.461
He's the tackiest man
in the United States Senate.

11:23.002 --> 11:24.560
He's a senator, is he?

11:25.071 --> 11:27.562
I just asked him for a glass of wine.

11:28.541 --> 11:30.702
Bill, you've made my evening.

11:30.810 --> 11:33.142
- Come on, let's get some air.
- All right.

11:37.917 --> 11:41.944
I christen thee the
SS Fontaine Delatur Dauterive.

11:42.088 --> 11:43.282
[Bill sniffs sadly]

11:43.389 --> 11:48.088
Ann, you're the best thing to happen
to my life since Lenore ruined it.

11:48.194 --> 11:50.788
- Your ex-wife?
- Yeah.

11:50.896 --> 11:53.490
I used to have kind of a taste for trash.

11:53.599 --> 11:56.466
But these days it's all prime rib...

11:56.569 --> 11:59.333
and filet mignon and tenderloin.

11:59.438 --> 12:02.805
Are you talking about dinner,
or are you talking about me?

12:03.042 --> 12:04.634
Mostly you.

12:04.877 --> 12:08.074
- Your boat! I'll get it.
- That's okay.

12:11.717 --> 12:13.708
I just stepped on a coin.

12:15.621 --> 12:16.588
So I said:

12:16.689 --> 12:18.657
"Ross, just because
you own the building...

12:18.758 --> 12:21.556
"doesn't mean you own the salad bar.
Get in line."

12:23.796 --> 12:25.423
You guys like baseball?

12:25.531 --> 12:28.762
If you're trying to smoke out
the communist, relax.

12:30.403 --> 12:31.893
We're all cool.

12:32.004 --> 12:35.735
No, I just thought you might like
to join me at a Rangers game.

12:35.841 --> 12:38.901
- I can go to the owner's box now.
- She's a keeper.

12:48.421 --> 12:51.356
You brought charcoal into our house.

12:51.457 --> 12:52.856
I didn't know what it was.

12:52.958 --> 12:56.359
Luanne asked me to hold it for her.
I thought it was drugs.

12:56.462 --> 12:59.124
There's soot under my boy's nails.

12:59.231 --> 13:01.825
You don't get that
from a clean-burning fuel.

13:01.934 --> 13:04.368
You don't get the rich smoky flavor either.

13:04.470 --> 13:06.370
Shut your mouth.

13:06.472 --> 13:09.600
Now, we're gonna sit here and pray.

13:11.944 --> 13:14.469
Ann Richards. So glad to meet you.

13:14.580 --> 13:16.912
Bill Dauterive, Ann's date.

13:17.016 --> 13:19.314
Ann Richards. So glad to meet you.

13:19.418 --> 13:21.545
Bill Dauterive, Ann's date.

13:21.921 --> 13:24.549
Ann Richards. So glad to meet you.

13:36.702 --> 13:39.637
- Hi, Bill.
- Lenore.

13:58.424 --> 14:02.292
Come on, Billy. Wake up, snap out of it.

14:02.395 --> 14:06.331
I thought I saw a ghost
or a horrible hobgoblin, or...

14:06.432 --> 14:08.093
LENORE: How you doing, baby?

14:09.769 --> 14:12.135
- Surprised?
- Lenore.

14:12.738 --> 14:14.899
As in your ex-wife?

14:16.776 --> 14:19.336
Excuse me. Lenore, Governor Richards.

14:19.445 --> 14:22.107
Governor Richards, Lenore.

14:22.615 --> 14:25.846
Well, I should probably go vomit.
Back in a jiff.

14:34.460 --> 14:35.449
[Exclaims]

14:35.561 --> 14:37.028
What are you doing here?

14:37.129 --> 14:40.257
I think the question is,
why did I ever leave?

14:40.699 --> 14:44.135
You said it was because I was fat and bald,
and I got too jealous...

14:44.236 --> 14:46.727
- whenever you had a date.
- Oh, Billy Goat.

14:46.839 --> 14:49.034
I'm the one who should be jealous of you.

14:49.141 --> 14:52.804
Showing up in the society pages
with the Governor on your arm?

14:52.945 --> 14:55.812
You looked pretty cute
in your penguin suit.

14:55.915 --> 14:57.940
Reminded me of our homecoming court.

14:58.050 --> 15:01.213
You were king,
and that stuck-up Filipino girl was queen...

15:01.320 --> 15:04.756
- and I stole you away.
- Yeah, I remember.

15:04.857 --> 15:07.758
- To the boiler room.
- Yeah, I remember.

15:07.893 --> 15:11.454
You call me at the Hotel Arlen.
I'm in the handicapped room.

15:12.431 --> 15:13.796
It's bigger.

15:16.802 --> 15:19.396
Lenore swung by my place last night.

15:20.306 --> 15:22.467
I told you she'd come back.

15:22.575 --> 15:24.065
'Course, that was seven years ago...

15:24.176 --> 15:26.644
and I was just trying
to make you feel better.

15:26.745 --> 15:29.612
- And now I do.
- Dang it, Bill.

15:29.715 --> 15:32.741
Lenore showed up
because you're on top of the world...

15:32.852 --> 15:36.049
with the former Governor of Texas.
Ask yourself this:

15:36.155 --> 15:39.921
Where was she when you couldn't stop
eating out of that garbage can?

15:40.025 --> 15:41.185
I'll tell you where.

15:41.293 --> 15:44.319
She was having corn on the cob
with that UPS guy.

15:44.430 --> 15:46.091
What's his name? Mike.

15:46.198 --> 15:48.826
I'm a grown man. Older, but wiser.

15:48.934 --> 15:51.300
And Lenore is older, but still pretty.

15:51.403 --> 15:54.702
True, Lenore is 10 times hotter
than Ann Richards...

15:54.807 --> 15:56.775
and Ann Richards is hot.

16:01.347 --> 16:04.475
Governor,
can I ask you a personal question?

16:04.583 --> 16:08.019
- Sure.
- What do you think of charcoal?

16:08.120 --> 16:10.088
It's pure evil, right?

16:10.189 --> 16:14.717
Hank, I may be a politician,
but I'm not afraid to speak my mind.

16:15.261 --> 16:17.024
Now, if you'll excuse me.

16:18.797 --> 16:21.960
I think I'm gonna take
my seventh-inning stretch early...

16:22.067 --> 16:24.661
maybe pick up a couple of Ranger Dogs.

16:24.770 --> 16:25.930
I'll keep you company.

16:26.038 --> 16:28.506
Can't a man get his own Ranger Dog?

16:29.542 --> 16:31.009
Down, in front.

16:33.379 --> 16:36.405
BILL: I miss you, too.
What are you wearing?

16:40.286 --> 16:42.186
That's a lot of clothes.

16:43.355 --> 16:46.950
Okay, then, General.
I'm glad you enjoyed your haircut.

16:47.059 --> 16:49.892
Yes, sir. Talk to you later. I love you.

16:49.995 --> 16:53.761
Bill, if you wanted to call Lenore,
why didn't you just tell me?

16:53.866 --> 16:55.265
I'm sorry.

16:55.367 --> 16:58.666
I just haven't had much practice
juggling women.

16:58.771 --> 17:00.102
You're not the kind of woman...

17:00.205 --> 17:02.969
who'd let me juggle her
with someone else, are you?

17:03.075 --> 17:04.872
It's over between us.

17:05.176 --> 17:07.771
We had fun, didn't we, Governor Richards?

17:07.880 --> 17:09.643
From the first minute...

17:09.748 --> 17:12.615
when your friend mooned me
in that elevator.

17:12.718 --> 17:16.313
- You knew the whole time?
- You took the fall for a friend...

17:16.422 --> 17:20.825
and I find that a whole lot more attractive
than Hank's bony ass.

17:26.632 --> 17:30.068
Oh, my God! Bill's birthday party.

17:30.336 --> 17:31.928
Winterfresh me.

17:33.072 --> 17:35.506
Close your eyes, I'll do your hair.

17:35.741 --> 17:39.507
Hey, Peggy, just in time for a burger.
What'll it be?

17:40.112 --> 17:42.637
Charcoal or propane?

17:42.748 --> 17:45.273
Propane. It's always been propane.

17:45.417 --> 17:49.717
C3H8.
Clean-burning, economical propane...

17:49.822 --> 17:53.258
Peggy, enough.
I'm not gonna force propane on you.

17:53.359 --> 17:56.328
That's an insult to propane and to you.

17:59.965 --> 18:02.593
I want you to choose, Peggy, right now.

18:02.801 --> 18:06.293
Which is better? Charcoal or me?

18:29.762 --> 18:30.854
Well?

18:39.071 --> 18:42.837
It is no contest.
The propane burger is much better.

18:48.213 --> 18:51.444
I'll just drive this down to the dump
right now.

18:52.351 --> 18:53.978
You lied, Mom.

18:54.086 --> 18:56.520
No, Bobby, I came to my senses.

18:56.655 --> 18:59.180
All of them. Except for taste.

19:01.727 --> 19:03.285
[Bill exclaiming joyfully]

19:03.495 --> 19:05.690
Lenore, you came!

19:05.798 --> 19:07.993
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

19:08.100 --> 19:11.501
- So, whose birthday is it?
- Mine.

19:12.104 --> 19:15.471
I'm sorry, baby. I didn't get you anything.

19:15.574 --> 19:18.566
Oh, no, that's okay.
Your presence is my present.

19:18.677 --> 19:23.205
And I can't wait
to take you home and unwrap you...

19:23.882 --> 19:25.509
and then have sex.

19:26.251 --> 19:27.912
Won't your girlfriend mind?

19:28.020 --> 19:30.113
I don't know. I'll ask her.

19:30.489 --> 19:32.684
- Do you mind?
- What?

19:32.791 --> 19:34.986
I dumped Ann Richards for you!

19:36.228 --> 19:38.628
I'm dating a man
who dumped Ann Richards.

19:38.731 --> 19:40.995
That's like me dumping Ann Richards.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.126
Why, Nancy Hicks Gribble,
I haven't seen you in ages.

19:44.236 --> 19:47.433
Did you hear that
Bill dumped Ann Richards for me?

19:51.543 --> 19:54.034
Lenore, you know, I've been thinking.

19:54.146 --> 19:57.172
I never really got around
to signing those divorce papers.

19:57.282 --> 19:59.910
Oh, that's okay. I forged your signature.

20:00.018 --> 20:01.485
"William" in script...

20:01.587 --> 20:04.750
"Dauterive" in block letters,
just like you do.

20:04.857 --> 20:07.087
You know me so well.

20:07.192 --> 20:10.559
I know your mother's maiden name,
your Social Security number...

20:10.662 --> 20:12.027
what foods will kill you.

20:12.131 --> 20:15.828
If I didn't care so much about you,
I could ruin your life.

20:17.436 --> 20:19.427
Lenore, will you marry me?

20:19.571 --> 20:21.436
Bill, it wouldn't work out.

20:21.540 --> 20:23.599
You live in Arlen. I live in...

20:24.143 --> 20:27.306
Well, I probably shouldn't tell you
where I live.

20:28.981 --> 20:32.849
- Ann, I forgot to dis-invite you.
- Bill, I can't stay.

20:32.951 --> 20:36.182
I've got to give the keynote
at a Hells Angels rally.

20:36.288 --> 20:38.552
I just came by
to wish you a happy birthday.

20:38.657 --> 20:40.682
No. You remembered.

20:40.959 --> 20:42.859
Bill asked me to marry him.

20:43.529 --> 20:46.589
But you said...
You wouldn't even tell me where you live.

20:46.698 --> 20:49.394
Bill, stop wasting the Governor's time
with your nonsense.

20:49.501 --> 20:52.095
I'm going to show Ann back to her car.

20:52.504 --> 20:54.404
I know the way back to my car.

20:54.506 --> 20:58.101
But my driver can't seem to find
the on-ramp for 35 South.

20:59.878 --> 21:01.311
I'll give you the short way.

21:01.413 --> 21:04.075
Take Raney all the way
until it dead-ends at the field...

21:04.183 --> 21:08.643
then you lift the chain,
go about 60 yards and that'll be the 35.

21:08.754 --> 21:10.813
LENORE: What are you doing
in that woman's limo?

21:10.923 --> 21:13.949
Get out here right now
and ask me to marry you, Bill.

21:14.059 --> 21:18.496
When somebody's serving up humble pie,
why do you keep going back for seconds?

21:18.597 --> 21:20.963
LENORE: William Fontaine
Delatur Dauterive.

21:21.066 --> 21:23.864
Ann, would you excuse me for a moment?

21:30.209 --> 21:33.406
And while you're at it, blow her a kiss!

21:33.512 --> 21:37.243
- Does that mean we've still got a chance?
- No.

21:37.349 --> 21:40.443
But it does mean you've still got a chance.

21:40.552 --> 21:44.044
- Now, can I give you a ride?
- I live right there.

21:44.156 --> 21:45.316
Driver.

22:26.531 --> 22:28.965
HANK: I'm doing it. I'm a mooner.
