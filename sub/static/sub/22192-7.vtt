00:27.041 --> 00:30.000
Oh, the sunflower seed muffin.

00:30.083 --> 00:32.708
Is there any more delectable creation

00:32.791 --> 00:36.375
than a fluffy, sweet little bread morsel,
served piping hot,

00:36.458 --> 00:37.958
stuffed full of birdseed?

00:38.041 --> 00:41.791
Yes. Without listing them,
which would take hours, the answer is yes.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.250
Think fast!
Or should I say, "Think breakfast!"

00:45.791 --> 00:47.166
Hey!

00:47.875 --> 00:49.291
What are you doing?

00:49.916 --> 00:50.750
Whoa!

00:50.833 --> 00:54.125
I can't have my BFFs fighting evil
on a boring stomach!

00:54.208 --> 00:57.750
So I'm adding a little potion pizzazz
to start your day!

00:59.291 --> 01:02.250
No, Pop! Stay back!
My muffin is perfect.

01:03.583 --> 01:05.416
- Aha!
- No!

01:05.500 --> 01:06.833
Yeah!

01:09.625 --> 01:10.791
Wait, what?

01:11.583 --> 01:13.708
Oh, thank heavens. It's fine--

01:15.083 --> 01:16.041
Oh, right!

01:19.208 --> 01:23.291
That's the potion that makes things
ricochet off the walls. What a classic!

01:24.166 --> 01:25.333
My muffin!

01:59.916 --> 02:01.208
What up, dudes?

02:01.916 --> 02:03.708
Whoa, what happened to the window?

02:03.791 --> 02:06.250
You broke it when you doused
Jet Vac's muffin.

02:06.333 --> 02:09.250
That muffin acted alone
and we all know it.

02:09.333 --> 02:10.708
Well, catch you later!

02:10.791 --> 02:13.750
And you remember
we have a team meeting

02:13.833 --> 02:15.375
at the Academy later, right?

02:15.458 --> 02:18.500
Duh! Got it locked down
in the ol' brain cage!

02:20.375 --> 02:24.000
Hey, someone left a muffin on the lawn.
Mmm.

02:24.083 --> 02:25.583
See ya, friendos!

02:27.291 --> 02:28.500
My muffin!

02:33.291 --> 02:37.000
-Anything else for you, sir?
-No way. I'm ready to pop!

02:37.083 --> 02:38.750
Ha!

02:38.833 --> 02:41.125
Get it? See, 'cause my name is Pop--

02:41.208 --> 02:43.166
Great. Here's your check.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.500
Uh... pardon,

02:44.583 --> 02:47.916
but I do believe I said
I didn't want anything else.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.458
Especially not this thing
with the numbers on it.

02:51.333 --> 02:52.416
Bah!

02:52.500 --> 02:55.000
Stupid money to pay for things.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.500
I really should get some of that
one of these days.

02:58.750 --> 03:02.000
Wait! I've got a potion
that'll make this job a snap!

03:06.000 --> 03:09.333
As far as the great philosophers go,
I find myself pondering

03:09.416 --> 03:12.458
who it was that best embodied
the legacy of Descartes.

03:12.541 --> 03:16.083
Now, of course you've got
your Malebranche and your Spinoza.

03:16.166 --> 03:19.958
We could argue the merits of those two
all afternoon, am I right?

03:20.041 --> 03:23.541
We could,
but I'd really rather do anything else.

03:24.125 --> 03:27.083
-Hello, Glummy!
-Kaos!

03:27.166 --> 03:29.333
Aw, you remember me.

03:29.416 --> 03:32.125
Well, the nightmare therapy
was working.

03:32.208 --> 03:35.500
So to what do I owe
the displeasure?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.958
Do you remember I saved you
from Broccoli Guy

03:38.041 --> 03:40.750
trying to siphon your life energy
and I said,

03:40.833 --> 03:42.041
"You owe me one"?

03:42.125 --> 03:46.125
Like it was yesterday.
Because it was, like, yesterday.

03:46.208 --> 03:50.166
Boo-yah! So I am here to collect
on said "one" you owe me.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.958
To wit, you will come with me
to Mother's castle.

03:53.041 --> 03:55.625
I am no longer a member
of the Doom Raiders

03:55.708 --> 03:58.041
and require your assistance
in winning back her trust.

03:58.125 --> 04:01.708
After, you know,
our little difference of opinion.

04:01.791 --> 04:04.500
When you committed
that unthinkable betrayal of Kaossandra

04:04.583 --> 04:07.833
by choosing sides against her
to join Golden Queen's gang?

04:07.916 --> 04:10.500
Yeesh! That sounds way worse
than I remember.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.000
Look, sir,
I'm truly happy here back at college.

04:13.083 --> 04:17.125
And my class is about to start.
So, I've gotta dash.

04:17.208 --> 04:21.875
The only place you're dashing is home,
with me.

04:21.958 --> 04:24.833
Hey! No known criminals on campus!

04:24.916 --> 04:27.416
Especially without a student ID.

04:32.916 --> 04:36.750
All righty, then.
Two can play this game, old chum.

04:36.833 --> 04:40.000
I mean, old Glum.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.333
Oof!

04:46.416 --> 04:47.458
Yo, Master Eon!

04:47.541 --> 04:49.666
Am I the first one for the team meeting?

04:49.750 --> 04:53.375
Team meeting?
Pop, that was over an hour ago!

04:53.458 --> 04:57.208
The team is fighting Fisticuffs!
They said they were going to call you.

04:57.291 --> 04:58.500
Oh, uh...!

04:58.583 --> 05:00.958
Looks like I got something on my phone.

05:01.541 --> 05:04.583
Go assist your teammates in their fight.
Hurry, Skylander!

05:04.666 --> 05:06.500
Right! I'm gonna do that!

05:10.250 --> 05:15.500
And... exactly where am I going to assist
said teammates?

05:18.791 --> 05:20.708
Fisticuffs,
you aren't getting out of this mess.

05:21.708 --> 05:23.875
No matter how many exercise bikes
you bat at us.

05:23.958 --> 05:27.375
I wanted to cancel my gym membership
without a hassle.

05:27.458 --> 05:30.291
That lady at the front said
they're gonna keep chargin' my card.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.458
I ain't payin' for a gym I don't use!

05:38.500 --> 05:41.500
Guys, I'm here for the fight
with Fisticuffs.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.833
Whoo!
Guys, I know where Fisticuffs is.

05:50.875 --> 05:55.333
I'm takin' this bike and selling it
on eStuff to get my money back.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.583
Where have you been?
If you'd been here all along,

06:01.666 --> 06:04.708
we could've stopped Fisticuffs
and still had time for a workout.

06:04.791 --> 06:07.208
Sorry. I came as fast as I could...

06:07.291 --> 06:09.833
after showing up to the meeting
an hour late.

06:09.916 --> 06:11.625
But I will totally fix this.

06:12.208 --> 06:15.250
I'll just buy that exercise bike
when Fisticuffs sells it

06:15.333 --> 06:17.291
and gift it back to Soulless Cycle.

06:19.875 --> 06:22.500
Skylanders! There's been a robbery
at Wa-Mabu Bank.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.291
Report to the scene at once!

06:25.708 --> 06:27.500
Describe the robber for us.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.375
Sure. He was a masked man.

06:29.458 --> 06:32.625
Hmm. This guy was a total pro.

06:32.708 --> 06:35.583
Who was small of stature
and spoke in a strange voice.

06:35.666 --> 06:37.916
A very  strange  voice.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.791
Boy, he sounds like a real character!

06:40.875 --> 06:44.750
He used a potion to make the coins rise
from the vault

06:45.125 --> 06:47.541
and march out of the bank with him!

06:49.791 --> 06:51.791
Whoa, I know what you're thinking.

06:52.500 --> 06:57.541
That I should totally create a potion
that makes stuff march around too! Can do!

06:59.375 --> 07:03.166
You really think I did this?
I don't even think I did this.

07:03.250 --> 07:06.083
Well, are you sure
you didn't rob this bank?

07:06.166 --> 07:07.000
Yes!

07:08.583 --> 07:09.750
No!

07:09.833 --> 07:11.916
Not-- not entirely. Look...

07:12.000 --> 07:14.541
I know I do crazy things, but...

07:14.625 --> 07:16.166
I'm not a bad guy,

07:16.250 --> 07:22.000
and robbing this bank is a bad thing.
So... I don't think so?

07:22.083 --> 07:24.041
Skylanders, I'm inclined to believe

07:24.125 --> 07:26.375
that this is
some sort of misunderstanding.

07:26.458 --> 07:28.250
So I decree that until such time

07:28.333 --> 07:31.291
when there is any real evidence
against Pop,

07:31.375 --> 07:34.208
- no one shall pass judgment.
- We've got evidence!

07:34.291 --> 07:39.291
Ja!  It is one of Pop's beakers
with blue hairs on the outsides.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.791
And by using my tech-tacular wrench,

07:41.875 --> 07:45.375
I was able to deduce
that the blue hair belongs to...

07:49.041 --> 07:50.250
Pop Fizz.

07:51.625 --> 07:54.041
I... I am truly sorry, Pop,

07:54.125 --> 07:57.916
but it seems the time
to pass judgment is nigh.

07:58.083 --> 08:01.291
You are under arrest
for magically-armed robbery.

08:02.416 --> 08:04.916
Skylanders, take him away.

08:13.583 --> 08:17.250
Welcome back
to "Advanced Assisting 201."

08:17.333 --> 08:20.541
Today, we'll be discussing
how to placate a grumpy

08:20.625 --> 08:23.958
and/or otherwise disagreeable supervisor.

08:24.041 --> 08:27.125
Oh! Oh! Offer to let him
withhold your dinner for a week?

08:27.208 --> 08:30.000
Hugo! I need you to don
your barrister's wig

08:30.083 --> 08:32.375
and represent Pop
as his court-appointed defense attorney!

08:32.791 --> 08:35.832
Yes, sir, Master Eon!

08:36.000 --> 08:38.916
- Wow, you're a lawyer too?
- That's right!

08:39.000 --> 08:42.916
I have 32 degrees
from Skylands Community College.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.583
Four more and they'll name
the student food court after me.

08:46.666 --> 08:50.666
Wait. Someone needs to teach class
in my absence.

08:50.958 --> 08:52.875
Young man, how would you like to--

08:52.958 --> 08:54.708
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it!

08:55.500 --> 08:59.791
I mean, if you're sure
it's what's best for the class, Professor.

08:59.958 --> 09:01.375
Here's the syllabus.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.916
If the students get restless,
put on a movie.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.625
The bathroom pass
is in the top right drawer.

09:06.708 --> 09:07.541
Toodles!

09:08.250 --> 09:12.125
Now that I am at the helm,
prepare to have your horizons expanded

09:12.208 --> 09:15.208
beyond any degree of horizon expansion

09:15.291 --> 09:17.375
you would previously have thought
reasonable.

09:18.166 --> 09:21.666
You may call me Professor Glumshanks.

09:25.375 --> 09:29.791
Now then, let us seek edification
in the classic examples of assistants

09:29.875 --> 09:33.500
which exist in great literature,
such as  Don Quixote.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.458
We all recognize the roots of the novel

09:36.541 --> 09:41.333
can be traced back to Cervantes,
as can the origin of the word "quixotic."

09:41.416 --> 09:46.333
But tell me, class, what is the true role
of Sancho Panza in the story?

09:46.416 --> 09:48.791
Nay, his purpose?

09:48.958 --> 09:52.125
Uh, to tell you that you're boring!

09:54.625 --> 09:58.666
-All right, all right, settle down.
-"All right, all right, settle down."

09:58.750 --> 10:01.916
"Also, I'm a big dummy-face
garbage eater!"

10:03.875 --> 10:07.041
-That's enough, thank you.
-No, no, thank you

10:07.125 --> 10:10.166
for being a sewage-swilling,
belly-button sniffer.

10:17.750 --> 10:21.625
Your Honor, in the case
of the People versus Pop Fizz--

10:21.708 --> 10:23.875
Hey, everybody! That's me!

10:23.958 --> 10:27.833
Oh, right.
Uh, this isn't supposed to be fun, is it?

10:27.916 --> 10:31.250
I'd like to begin by presenting
our evidence to the court.

10:33.625 --> 10:36.541
My beakers!
Do I get those back after the trial?

10:37.833 --> 10:41.666
We tested the hair samples
from the beakers against Pop Fizz's fur.

10:42.250 --> 10:45.208
It was a 100% DNA match
to the defendant.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.125
No way.

10:49.708 --> 10:51.666
- Order! Order!
- Your Honor.

10:51.750 --> 10:56.791
I'd just like to say,
no further questions.

10:56.875 --> 10:57.916
Your Honor,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.291
the defense will now present witnesses

11:00.375 --> 11:04.791
who shall vouch for the strong
moral character of the defendant.

11:04.875 --> 11:08.791
When I was a cadet, Professor Pop
stayed after class if I needed help.

11:08.875 --> 11:11.500
If I bombed a test, he'd let me retake it.

11:11.583 --> 11:15.125
If he literally bombed my test
with a potion, he'd let me retake it.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.458
Pop is the best.

11:16.541 --> 11:20.583
If you are dying to tell someone a secret,
he will never tell anyone.

11:20.666 --> 11:22.083
Because he'll forget it.

11:22.666 --> 11:25.083
Pop Fizz is the finest man I know.

11:25.166 --> 11:29.125
He's a lifelong friend and ally,
and he'd never hurt a fly.

11:29.500 --> 11:33.958
Except Fly Man. The villain who's always
landing on everyone's food and ruining it.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.791
Pop definitely would hurt him.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.541
As would I. I mean... he's a fly.

11:38.791 --> 11:40.583
Ew. Gross. Am I right?

11:42.791 --> 11:45.375
Students! Quiet, please! Agh!

11:45.458 --> 11:48.416
Come on!
You can still put an eye out with paper.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.625
Fine.

11:50.708 --> 11:53.125
Though it goes against everything
I believe in,

11:53.208 --> 11:57.250
it's time to violate one of my
sacred tenets of academia and...

11:57.458 --> 11:59.291
Oh!

11:59.375 --> 12:01.708
Show a movie in class.

12:02.666 --> 12:05.875
For the love of--
that was the only projector we have!

12:05.958 --> 12:09.625
Ah, it'll be okay, Teach.
Maybe I can help.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.208
Kaos?

12:11.291 --> 12:12.625
Attention, class!

12:12.708 --> 12:16.000
Instead of Professor "Dumb-stanks'"
boring movie,

12:16.083 --> 12:19.375
we'll be screening
one of my favorite horror pictures,

12:19.458 --> 12:21.791
The Un-Silence of the Lambs.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.458
-Yeah!
-Whoo-hoo!

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
All right!

12:30.041 --> 12:32.041
Ahem.

12:32.125 --> 12:37.625
Mr. Fizz, do you remember committing
the robbery of which you are accused?

12:37.708 --> 12:39.291
Nope! But...

12:39.375 --> 12:42.333
I also don't remember not committing it.

12:42.416 --> 12:46.833
But you didn't actually do it, right?

12:49.333 --> 12:53.250
I don't think so. But maybe I did?

12:54.166 --> 12:56.375
Your Honor,
I object to my client's testimony!

12:56.458 --> 12:57.708
On what grounds?

12:57.791 --> 13:00.875
On the grounds he's sinking our case!

13:01.458 --> 13:02.708
It's okay, Hugo.

13:02.791 --> 13:05.791
I've been listening to the evidence
and testimony all day

13:05.875 --> 13:07.833
that points in one direction.

13:07.916 --> 13:11.791
Mine. I know deep down
I would never do something like this.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.666
But I've done stuff
I couldn't remember before.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.875
Maybe this is one of those times.

13:16.958 --> 13:18.958
I took an oath as a Skylander

13:19.041 --> 13:22.166
to always defend the Skylands
from anyone trying to do harm.

13:22.250 --> 13:25.833
But it sounds like this time,
the one doing harm was  me.

13:25.916 --> 13:30.208
So like every other bad guy
who gets caught, justice must be served.

13:30.958 --> 13:33.250
I have heard enough. Jury?

13:37.041 --> 13:39.541
We find Pop Fizz...

13:39.625 --> 13:40.916
guilty!

13:42.375 --> 13:46.500
And we recommend a sentence of 20 years
in Cloudcracker Prison.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.625
So shall it be.

13:55.375 --> 13:56.750
Court is adjourned.

13:56.833 --> 14:00.208
Bailiff, please remand the defendant
to your custody.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.375
I am so sorry, Pop.

14:08.416 --> 14:12.708
Skylanders, it is a sad day when
we must replace a member of the team,

14:12.791 --> 14:15.791
especially one who has succumbed
to the temptation of darkness.

14:16.500 --> 14:17.500
However,

14:17.583 --> 14:21.458
we also have to continue our fight
against evil and cannot do so undermanned.

14:21.541 --> 14:24.291
So Skylander Sprocket will be joining us

14:24.375 --> 14:27.875
until we find a more permanent member
to fill out our roster.

14:27.958 --> 14:29.083
Sprocket?

14:29.166 --> 14:31.208
But she helped put Pop behind bars!

14:31.291 --> 14:34.458
How can we trust her to have our backs
if she didn't have his?

14:34.541 --> 14:37.125
Sprocket didn't send Pop Fizz to jail.

14:37.208 --> 14:40.458
The evidence did.
You heard Pop say it himself.

14:40.541 --> 14:43.750
Even he thought he was guilty
after all we heard in that courtroom.

14:43.833 --> 14:46.666
I still don't believe he did it,
evidence or not.

14:46.750 --> 14:48.625
Then that makes two of us.

14:48.708 --> 14:51.958
Whaddaya mean, Sprocket?
You think Pop is innocent?

14:52.041 --> 14:54.250
He could be. After the trial,

14:54.333 --> 14:57.250
I was able to track down some coins
stolen from the bank.

14:57.333 --> 15:00.375
Whatever power held sway
over some of them has passed.

15:00.458 --> 15:02.916
They've been turning up here and there
across the Skylands.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.041
-Do they have Pop's fingerprints on them?
-No.

15:05.125 --> 15:08.666
But that's not the strangest part.
They don't have any prints on them.

15:08.750 --> 15:12.166
As if whoever took them in the first place
has no fingerprints.

15:12.250 --> 15:15.666
But it was still Pop's potions
that brought them to life, yes?

15:15.750 --> 15:17.750
Not according to my findings.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.958
I ran tests over each coin,

15:21.041 --> 15:23.416
and the magic that controlled them
isn't consistent

15:23.500 --> 15:26.041
with anything found in any of his beakers.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.708
Does that mean someone framed Pop
for the bank robbery?

15:28.791 --> 15:30.750
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

15:30.833 --> 15:33.291
Even if Pop is the fall guy
for this crime,

15:33.375 --> 15:37.083
we must still find the real crook
and bring him to justice.

15:38.166 --> 15:39.416
You really mean it?

15:39.500 --> 15:42.250
That someone else robbed that bank
and I'm innocent?

15:42.333 --> 15:43.416
It's looking good, Pop.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.041
But it'll be a huge help
if you remember anything

15:46.125 --> 15:49.291
about where you might've been
when the robbery was happening.

15:49.375 --> 15:54.375
I've tried and tried, JV, but that day
is just a big jumble in my brain.

15:54.458 --> 15:58.333
Like the new potions I was wanting
to mix that day but couldn't

15:58.416 --> 16:00.625
because I ran out of beakers
for some reason.

16:00.708 --> 16:03.375
That's why I went to Beaker Seeker.
To replace those--

16:04.375 --> 16:07.333
I was at the beaker store
when the robbery was going down.

16:07.416 --> 16:08.333
Now I remember!

16:08.416 --> 16:09.583
-I knew it.
-Finally!

16:09.666 --> 16:13.416
-You sweet little idiot.
-That would've been helpful last week.

16:13.500 --> 16:17.250
Skylanders, there's been another robbery
in the forest. Go there at once!

16:17.333 --> 16:18.666
Stay strong, Pop.

16:18.750 --> 16:21.541
Gonna figure out who's committing
these robberies and get you out.

16:21.625 --> 16:22.833
Yay--

16:23.750 --> 16:25.166
Describe the stolen item, sir.

16:25.250 --> 16:29.166
It was my awesome calorie-counting
wi-fi enabled smart watch!

16:29.250 --> 16:33.041
If my watch isn't tracking my calories,
am I burning them at all?

16:33.125 --> 16:36.375
Sir, please. Can you tell us
what the culprit looked like?

16:36.458 --> 16:38.375
Uh, let's see. Little guy!

16:38.458 --> 16:41.375
Strange voice,
left a bunch of beakers behind.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.125
That sounds like Pop! But that can't be.

16:44.541 --> 16:47.541
Unless he has an evil twin
he knows nothing about.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.208
Guys, look what I found.

16:50.875 --> 16:53.791
It's green... hair.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.416
Or fur. Or...

16:55.500 --> 16:56.541
Felt.

16:56.625 --> 17:00.416
This green felt could be from the fiend
who framed Pop.

17:00.666 --> 17:05.083
And based on my deductions,
this is a very specific kind of felt.

17:05.165 --> 17:06.458
Puppet felt.

17:06.540 --> 17:09.790
Green puppet felt?
That sounds exactly like--

17:09.875 --> 17:14.165
Me! And I want to be the best "me"
that I can possibly be!

17:14.250 --> 17:16.708
Oh, and you bloody well will, ol' friend.

17:16.790 --> 17:19.625
Thanks to Pop Fizz
leaving his beakers everywhere,

17:19.708 --> 17:21.958
he went down like a didgeri-dum-dum.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.083
We was totally able to frame him
for that robbery

17:25.165 --> 17:29.666
and score the money we needed
for your expensive cosmetic surgeries.

17:30.666 --> 17:33.833
I'm so excited for my calf implants!

17:35.625 --> 17:37.875
The jig is up, Chompy Mage!

17:38.541 --> 17:39.666
Skylanders?

17:39.750 --> 17:42.375
How did you know
it was us doin' them crimes?

17:42.458 --> 17:45.416
Easy. You used magic
to make the money come to life.

17:45.500 --> 17:49.208
Plus, no fingerprints means you palmed
the money with your puppet's mouth.

17:49.291 --> 17:52.833
Plus, you left a trail
of incriminating green felt!

17:53.416 --> 17:55.833
Well, you might've caught us green-handed.

17:55.916 --> 17:56.916
Good one, Chompy!

17:57.000 --> 17:59.875
But we ain't goin' nowheres
without a fight!

18:01.791 --> 18:03.750
What is that?

18:05.583 --> 18:09.916
-Chompies.
-Whatcha gonna do now, SkyUglies?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.625
Hey, guys, wanna see something neat?

18:25.250 --> 18:26.875
Yep, that was neat.

18:40.583 --> 18:41.500
Wa-hoo!

18:41.583 --> 18:42.750
-I'm free!
-He's free!

18:42.833 --> 18:44.166
Bring it in!

18:44.250 --> 18:46.708
Trade in some of that "thug life"

18:46.791 --> 18:48.958
-for some "hug life."
-Watch the wrench, people.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.041
Why is all this chaos taking place
in my classroom?

19:01.125 --> 19:03.125
It's funny you should use
the word "chaos."

19:03.208 --> 19:07.125
Must I list the infractions
I am bearing witness to?

19:07.208 --> 19:10.333
One, the curriculum has not been followed.

19:10.416 --> 19:15.166
Two, that student is using
a cellular telephone during class.

19:15.250 --> 19:18.625
Three, that person
isn't even a registered student!

19:18.708 --> 19:20.166
Busted!

19:20.250 --> 19:24.958
And worst of all, the class
is watching a movie about sheep!

19:25.750 --> 19:28.666
No sheep movies  ever  in my classroom!

19:28.750 --> 19:30.791
Now come with me to--

19:31.375 --> 19:36.000
A real sheep?
This is the worst infraction of all.

19:36.083 --> 19:41.666
Mr. Glumshanks, you are expelled
from Skylands Community College!

19:41.750 --> 19:44.916
I say good-- eh?

19:45.000 --> 19:45.916
Baa-aa.

19:50.041 --> 19:52.625
And... my work here is done.

19:52.708 --> 19:55.458
Looks like you have no option
but to accompany me home

19:55.541 --> 19:57.708
and help me win my mother's love
once more.

19:58.708 --> 20:01.083
All this just to get me kicked out
of school?

20:01.166 --> 20:05.708
Well, it was an arduous
and painful experience, was it not?

20:05.791 --> 20:07.875
Misery personified.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.541
-Well played.
-Off we go, then.

20:10.625 --> 20:13.166
I can't wait to see Mother!
How has she been?

20:13.250 --> 20:17.208
Oh, she's been keeping busy, sir.
Busy, indeed.

20:20.708 --> 20:24.208
You opened the Endless Void on your own?
How can that be?

20:27.750 --> 20:33.458
You may still lord over my dark prison,
Kaossandra,

20:33.541 --> 20:38.291
but your efforts to contain me
grow weaker by the day.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.083
Keep dreaming, you monster.

20:40.583 --> 20:46.791
Darkness spreads across Skylands.
It feeds me.

20:46.875 --> 20:51.416
You will join me in darkness.
It beckons to you.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.833
I've seen enough of what true evil can do.
I'll never go there again.

21:01.666 --> 21:04.833
-Good morning, my dudes!
-Pop! What is all this?

21:04.916 --> 21:07.791
I made this to make up
for ruining breakfast last time.

21:07.875 --> 21:12.125
And the time before that.
And all those other times. Anywho--

21:12.208 --> 21:13.291
Mmm!

21:13.375 --> 21:15.875
-You didn't need to do this.
-But I did!

21:15.958 --> 21:18.041
I want you to know I've learned my lesson.

21:18.125 --> 21:20.708
From now on,
I'm gonna be more responsible

21:20.791 --> 21:23.000
and curb my impulsive tendencies.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.791
And to that end,
I'm gonna label every potion

21:25.875 --> 21:27.916
and write down exactly what it does.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.666
-Very responsible, mate. Good for you!
-Good for all of us.

21:35.875 --> 21:39.791
Ooh, you're a bubbly little guy.
What do you do?

21:43.250 --> 21:46.625
Okey-doke. So this is the potion
that makes things ping-pong!

21:46.708 --> 21:47.625
Noted!

21:53.208 --> 21:55.250
I love being responsible!

21:55.333 --> 21:56.375
Knock it off!
