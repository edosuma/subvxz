Admit it,

00:06.877 --> 00:09.048
you wanted Noelle Gardner to die.

00:09.103 --> 00:10.670
I wouldn't say that.

00:10.704 --> 00:12.071
You tracked down a dying young woman,

00:12.106 --> 00:15.108
bought her insurance policy,
paying her pennies for it.

00:15.209 --> 00:16.524
It was $100,000.

00:16.559 --> 00:17.896
So you could be the beneficiary

00:17.931 --> 00:20.868
and collect $250,000

00:20.969 --> 00:23.281
when she died six months later.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.538
Admit it. You killed Noelle Gardner.

00:25.606 --> 00:27.666
- I can't admit that.
- Why not?

00:27.700 --> 00:31.265
Because she's sitting right
there next to your partner.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.499
And that's why you're suing her...

00:32.534 --> 00:33.667
because she lived.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.300
Because she lied.

00:35.368 --> 00:39.805
Because she lived, thanks
to a miracle Amazon cure.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.807
Noelle knew about that cure
before her trip to Amazonia

00:42.874 --> 00:44.706
and before I bought her policy.

00:44.741 --> 00:46.907
It wasn't a miracle. It was fraud.

excuse me, Mr. Singletary,

00:52.843 --> 00:54.277

00:54.312 --> 00:55.845
I'm an actuary.

00:55.879 --> 00:58.445
I believe in facts and numbers.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.745
Numbers never lie.

00:59.780 --> 01:01.478
No, because the fact is,

01:01.512 --> 01:03.545
no matter how many lawsuits you bring,

01:03.613 --> 01:06.045
you'll be on the hook
to pay Noelle's premiums

01:06.112 --> 01:10.315
for what we can only hope
is a long and happy life.

01:10.350 --> 01:11.950

- Sustained.

01:13.618 --> 01:15.618

01:15.653 --> 01:16.953

Well, we had one good day,
but it's... it's far from over.

01:31.362 --> 01:33.363
I'm gonna take that as a "yes."

01:33.397 --> 01:34.797
Okay, come on, Rayann.

01:34.831 --> 01:36.698
- It wasn't a "yes."
- Noelle, it's... hmm.

01:36.766 --> 01:38.299
- It was like a "no."
- Yeah, it was.

01:38.333 --> 01:40.401
You were wrong about me.

01:40.469 --> 01:42.469
It's nothing personal, Mr. Singletary.

settle, in spite of the facts.

01:48.742 --> 01:49.975

- Well, why settle?

01:50.010 --> 01:51.910
You're a gambling man. Roll the dice.

01:51.978 --> 01:54.579
I don't gamble. I predict.

- Yeah.

08:51.926 --> 08:53.126
We don't validate.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.000
Wendell, how did it go?

09:00.035 --> 09:01.202
Not well.

09:01.270 --> 09:03.371
This is my assistant, Jill. I don't drive.

09:03.439 --> 09:05.006
You're not gonna represent him?

09:05.040 --> 09:06.374
It's okay.

09:06.442 --> 09:08.542
No, I have worked with
Wendell for six years.

09:08.576 --> 09:10.377
He helps people.

09:10.411 --> 09:11.845
By short-buying their lives?

09:11.946 --> 09:13.814
By allowing terminally ill patients

09:13.848 --> 09:15.216
a chance to live out their dreams

09:15.250 --> 09:16.850
and have a full life before they die.

09:16.885 --> 09:19.053
Explain what you do with the money.

09:19.087 --> 09:21.122
No, it's not worth it. They don't care.

09:21.156 --> 09:23.825
Actually, go ahead. Tell us.

09:23.859 --> 09:26.094
He donates 30% to the foundation

09:26.128 --> 09:27.295
of the illness they die of.

09:27.329 --> 09:30.431
30%. Oh. What about the 70%?

09:30.465 --> 09:33.200
42.5% support my elderly mother and aunt,

09:33.234 --> 09:35.870
and the other 27.5% I'm saving...

09:35.904 --> 09:37.938
to retire in Italy, my spiritual home.

09:37.972 --> 09:40.507
Look, I understand that
my job doesn't make me

09:40.541 --> 09:42.341
the most sympathetic person,

09:42.376 --> 09:45.212
but I did not kill Noelle.

09:47.415 --> 09:49.349
- Give us a moment.
- [Clears throat]

09:49.383 --> 09:51.084
What are you thinking here?

09:51.152 --> 09:52.385
Do we have a choice?

09:52.419 --> 09:54.020
- Well, Stanton believes him.
- Yeah.

09:55.522 --> 09:57.023
You know, if we take the case,

09:57.057 --> 09:58.425
the judge isn't gonna let us use

09:58.459 --> 10:00.260
any of the evidence
from Noelle's civil case.

10:00.294 --> 10:01.294
It's gonna be a firewall.

10:05.566 --> 10:08.501
Okay. All right, we'll, uh, take your case.

10:08.536 --> 10:11.504
Wow. Great.

10:11.539 --> 10:14.374
Coming here, I put the odds
of you taking this at 8-to-1,

10:14.442 --> 10:16.510
factoring in your antipathy towards me,

10:16.544 --> 10:18.211
and also what I perceive to be

10:18.279 --> 10:19.579
- your willingness to take on a challenge.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:19.614 --> 10:21.081
Wendell, Wendell, Wendell, please.

10:21.115 --> 10:22.549
Yeah, don't make us change our mind, okay?

10:27.137 --> 10:29.639
Uh, and that moves the bike-plan hearing

10:29.674 --> 10:32.208
from 6:00 to 7:00 P.M. on Thursday

10:32.243 --> 10:34.978
to accommodate the vegan
raw foods class clean-up.

10:35.013 --> 10:36.346
It's a straightforward case, Summer.

10:36.381 --> 10:38.182
You're gonna be back
at your hives by lunch.

10:38.216 --> 10:39.716
My hives are my living.

10:39.751 --> 10:42.319
I sell the honey, and I help
other people start their farms.

10:42.353 --> 10:44.655
I... i... if I can't keep that
going... we're gonna be fine.

10:44.689 --> 10:46.523
Uh, with a big thanks to Willow

10:46.557 --> 10:49.059
for her enlightened meditation
demo on disaster prep.

10:49.127 --> 10:52.162
And, uh, that leaves us with, uh...

10:52.196 --> 10:55.132
Uh, Damien Karp, representing
Summer Wallace, Mr. Bixby.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.634
Uh, Summer retained counsel, huh?

10:57.669 --> 11:00.204
Every bee deserves its day, right?

11:00.238 --> 11:02.039
Uh, I'm here for the city, Bix.

11:02.073 --> 11:03.741
Hey, there. Lyle.

11:03.775 --> 11:06.744
So, mister...

11:06.811 --> 11:08.245
Bix,

11:08.313 --> 11:10.046
this is just a simple misunderstanding.

11:10.081 --> 11:12.416
Now, bees disrupted the birthday
party of summer's neighbor,

11:12.450 --> 11:14.484
but venice is full of bees.

11:14.519 --> 11:16.587
How can we be sure the
bees were Ms. Wallace's?

11:16.654 --> 11:19.423
Can Mr. Karp prove they
weren't Ms. Wallace's bees?

11:19.457 --> 11:21.492
Actually, the burden of proof's on you.

11:21.526 --> 11:24.161
Well, what about footage from
Achilles' birthday party...

11:24.196 --> 11:26.597
- Achilles?
- ... Showing Ms. Wallace's bees going over her fence

11:26.698 --> 11:28.065
into her neighbor's yard?

11:28.100 --> 11:30.034
- Would that help?
- Helps me.

11:30.068 --> 11:32.736
I move we schedule an official hearing.

11:32.771 --> 11:33.737
All in favor?

11:33.772 --> 11:35.272
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

11:35.340 --> 11:37.008
I'll see you at the next meeting.

11:37.042 --> 11:38.242
- We're out!
- [Cellphone vibrates]

11:38.276 --> 11:40.411
Namaste.

11:40.445 --> 11:42.513
Awesome.

11:42.547 --> 11:44.514
Rachel. Hey.

11:44.549 --> 11:46.450
Yeah, we had, um... we
had a little setback,

11:46.517 --> 11:48.451
but we're gonna get them at the hearing.

11:48.486 --> 11:50.253
This is going to a hearing?

11:50.288 --> 11:53.189
I gave you a simple task,
like taking out the garbage.

11:53.223 --> 11:55.257
Okay, that's an overreaction.

11:55.292 --> 11:57.492
No, course correction. You're getting help.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.461
You're getting Franklin and Bash.

11:59.495 --> 12:00.762
[Receiver slams]

12:02.065 --> 12:03.765
Hey. Good news.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.268
You know that $250,000 in benefits?

12:06.335 --> 12:08.604
- Mm-hmm.
- Turns out there was a rider on Noelle's policy

12:08.638 --> 12:11.073
that wasn't mentioned in discovery.

12:11.107 --> 12:13.342
Where is, uh, Wendell?

12:13.377 --> 12:15.679
Kind of thought he would be here.

12:15.713 --> 12:17.747
We switched it to later. Why?

12:17.782 --> 12:19.616
Yeah, you could have
texted us this information.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.352
You didn't have to come all the way down.

12:21.386 --> 12:23.154
Yeah, I kind of wish I had now.

12:23.188 --> 12:25.123
So, the rider?

12:25.190 --> 12:27.058
Makes Wendell sole beneficiary,

12:27.092 --> 12:28.560
unless, of course, he is convicted

12:28.594 --> 12:29.828
of causing Noelle's death.

12:29.863 --> 12:31.463
Interesting.

12:31.498 --> 12:32.731
Who's next in line?

12:32.766 --> 12:35.334
It's intestate... family succession.

12:35.402 --> 12:37.736
Both: Rayann.

12:37.804 --> 12:39.304
That's good work, Carm.

12:39.338 --> 12:42.741
And we'll call you next
time Wendell's here.

12:42.775 --> 12:45.477
And you can explain the weird
attraction women have to him.

12:45.511 --> 12:47.145
You wouldn't understand.

12:47.179 --> 12:49.180
- That's true.
- I understand weird attraction.

12:49.248 --> 12:51.349
- I love that movie.
- It's a great movie.

12:51.417 --> 12:52.651
What do you want to do with your office?

12:52.685 --> 12:54.486
Use it as a steel-cage octagon?

12:54.520 --> 12:56.320
Eh, it's too small. How
about a recording studio?

12:56.422 --> 12:57.488
You know what would be really cool?

12:57.522 --> 12:59.490
I have a job for you.

12:59.525 --> 13:01.659
- Clever.
- Right?

13:01.693 --> 13:03.627
We already have a job... a murder job.

13:03.662 --> 13:05.796
Now you have another job... bee case.

13:05.831 --> 13:07.832
Ooh, I'd like to take

13:07.866 --> 13:10.501
the case of the bees with
Damien, if that's all right.

13:10.536 --> 13:12.671
You have more important
work to do. Let them take it.

13:12.705 --> 13:15.473
Is the death of honey not important?

13:15.508 --> 13:17.576
Last winter, on my trip,

13:17.644 --> 13:21.213
I was moved by the
Egyptian tombs of Pabasa,

13:21.280 --> 13:23.782
from the 26th dynasty,

13:23.816 --> 13:26.485
depicting the ancient art of apiculture.

13:26.519 --> 13:28.454
"Apiculture"?

13:28.488 --> 13:30.122
I didn't know they had monkeys in Egypt.

13:30.156 --> 13:32.291
Dude, "Raiders of the lost ark,"

13:32.325 --> 13:33.659
the monkey ate the poison date.

13:33.727 --> 13:34.894
Oh. Right.

13:34.928 --> 13:36.195
Bees, gentlemen.

13:36.230 --> 13:37.563
- It was a monkey.
- No.

13:37.598 --> 13:40.566
Bees... I myself will join the fight

13:40.667 --> 13:42.569
for these marvelous insects,

13:42.603 --> 13:44.904
saving them so that they may,

13:44.939 --> 13:47.240
in turn, save us.

13:47.307 --> 13:49.909
[Chuckles]

13:49.943 --> 13:51.710
That desk goes back into Peter's office

13:51.812 --> 13:53.479
after your playdate.

13:55.482 --> 13:58.817
You know, when she talks like
that and looks like that...

13:58.852 --> 14:00.285
Blood flow changes.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.553
Yeah.

14:01.588 --> 14:03.221
We're gonna make a left turn here.

14:03.322 --> 14:04.556
Don't go to your right. That's water.

14:04.590 --> 14:06.391
- [Laughs] Okay.
- Almost there.

14:06.425 --> 14:08.359
Seriously, can I please open my eyes?

14:08.394 --> 14:10.328
No, you got to keep them
closed the entire date.

14:10.362 --> 14:11.362
- It's a blind date.
- Really?

14:11.397 --> 14:12.430
- Yeah.
- Aah!

14:12.498 --> 14:13.230
- We're almost there.
- Okay.

14:13.265 --> 14:14.298
You got it.

14:14.332 --> 14:15.933
- Ready?
- Okay.

14:15.967 --> 14:18.635
Open your eyes.

14:18.703 --> 14:21.171
Oh, wow. [Laughs]

14:21.239 --> 14:23.307
You don't mess around on first dates.

14:23.341 --> 14:25.342
Uh, j... just dinner.

14:25.376 --> 14:27.477
Really? I also rented
some doves to circle us,

14:27.511 --> 14:28.845
but they got loose in my car, and...

14:28.913 --> 14:30.614
Yeah, they're probably
over Koreatown by now.

14:30.648 --> 14:32.883
- I think we'll manage.
- Yeah.

14:32.951 --> 14:35.252
- After you.
- Thanks.

14:35.287 --> 14:37.821
Jared and I give our clients
the best defense we can,

14:37.889 --> 14:39.623
even if it means bending a few rules.

14:39.657 --> 14:41.958
Yeah, I'm with you... when
it comes to my patients,

14:41.992 --> 14:44.461
I don't let the insurance get in the way.

14:44.495 --> 14:47.515
Well, here's to breaking the rules.

14:51.469 --> 14:53.403
We are so bad-ass.

14:53.437 --> 14:55.472
[Laughs]

14:55.539 --> 14:57.707
You're not like other lawyers, Peter.

14:57.742 --> 14:59.276
And you're...

14:59.310 --> 15:01.377
the first kinesiologist I've ever met,

15:01.445 --> 15:03.647
- so I have nothing to compare it to.
- [Laughs]

15:05.416 --> 15:06.950
Oh, that's raw.

15:06.985 --> 15:08.585
Yeah.

15:08.619 --> 15:10.854
That's not lit.

15:10.888 --> 15:11.922
[Sighs]

15:11.956 --> 15:13.390
Oh, boy.

15:13.424 --> 15:16.760
Well, I guess the wind blew it out.

15:16.794 --> 15:19.396
This is gonna take a while.

15:19.430 --> 15:22.665
Counselor Bash up against a jury of one.

15:22.733 --> 15:24.734
All right, what else have you got?

15:24.769 --> 15:27.504
Well, for starters,
you need to finish this.

15:27.605 --> 15:28.772
[Laughing] Okay.

15:28.806 --> 15:30.841
Okay, let me see what we have here.

15:30.909 --> 15:34.311
We have chocolate... to melt.

15:34.345 --> 15:35.745
[Laughs]

15:35.780 --> 15:39.383
Cheese... to melt.

15:39.418 --> 15:42.720
Strawberries, bread,

15:42.788 --> 15:44.856
balsamic muddled

15:44.890 --> 15:46.425
strawberry bruschetta.

15:46.459 --> 15:49.795
Eh, this is an epic fail.

15:53.767 --> 15:56.002
I wouldn't call it an epic fail.

15:56.036 --> 15:58.905
I'll give you a do-over, anyway.

15:58.939 --> 16:01.074
Okay.

16:01.109 --> 16:04.010
I owe you dinner... or dessert,

16:04.045 --> 16:06.379
whatever that wasn't.

16:06.447 --> 16:07.881
Okay.

16:07.915 --> 16:09.482
Jared: So, good?

16:09.517 --> 16:12.452
Yeah, I'd say it was a perfect date.

16:12.486 --> 16:14.621
Like top-10, all-time perfect?

16:14.655 --> 16:16.656
Top five.

16:16.691 --> 16:19.693
You know, we just talked
a lot, about everything.

16:19.727 --> 16:21.528
No mention about the kid.

16:21.562 --> 16:23.397
You'll know Charlie likes
you in a different way

16:23.431 --> 16:24.865
- when you meet the kid.
- What do you mean?

16:24.899 --> 16:26.867
Like a pre-interview for a stepdad?

16:26.901 --> 16:28.568
No, stupid... I'm just saying you'll know

16:28.603 --> 16:30.003
- she takes you seriously.
- I'm just saying...

16:30.037 --> 16:31.771
I don't want anything serious, stupid.

16:31.806 --> 16:33.941
All I know is that I'd be
having some serious sex right now

16:33.975 --> 16:36.009
if you hadn't forgotten to
put the lighter back in the bag

16:36.044 --> 16:37.860
after we shot off those
bottle rockets into the ocean.

16:37.865 --> 16:38.632
Let me get this straight...

16:38.633 --> 16:40.774
you're saying it was a done deal
if it wasn't for the lighter.

16:40.775 --> 16:43.435
Yeah, I'm saying it was...
I would have been done...

16:43.436 --> 16:45.016
- You would have closed if it wasn't for the lighter?
- I would have been... 

16:45.017 --> 16:46.227
I'm sticking with the lighter.

16:46.230 --> 16:47.301
- So it was just the lighter.
- I'm sticking with the lighter.

16:47.302 --> 16:47.997
Carmen: Breaking news.

16:48.991 --> 16:51.659
Proof that Noelle knew about her cure

16:51.694 --> 16:53.661
before she sold her policy to Wendell.

16:53.696 --> 16:55.931
Turns out that trip that she reported

16:55.965 --> 16:58.333
to her insurance company
was her second trip.

16:58.367 --> 16:59.634
She never mentioned the first one.

16:59.668 --> 17:00.902
Wait, so Wendell was right?

17:00.970 --> 17:02.703
Noelle did defraud him?

17:02.738 --> 17:05.573
- Which makes us, who are her lawyers...
- Equally duped.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.074
- There's more.
- Oh, good.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.775
You know her sister, Rayann?

17:08.843 --> 17:10.477
Yeah, the one that's not
returning our phone calls?

17:10.511 --> 17:12.545
Well, a neighbor did...
she said she saw Rayann

17:12.579 --> 17:14.781
entering Noelle's building at 3:30 A.M.

17:14.815 --> 17:16.348
The morning she died.

17:16.383 --> 17:18.351
Rayann lives in Santa Monica.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.852
What was she doing all the way across town

17:19.886 --> 17:21.520
the morning Noelle died?

17:31.034 --> 17:33.002
Peter: You don't know anything
about how a dog park works.

17:33.037 --> 17:34.971
You're supposed to put the
dog down, let her run around.

17:35.006 --> 17:36.773
- It's a loaner.
- [Dog barks]

17:36.807 --> 17:38.275
I don't want her to get eaten
by one of these big dogs.

17:38.309 --> 17:40.043
[Sweetly] No, I don't.

17:40.111 --> 17:41.879
All right, you're... you're...
you're embarrassing me. Stop it.

17:41.913 --> 17:43.680
- You're embarrassing. You don't have a dog.
- Stop it.

17:43.715 --> 17:45.182
Hey, hey, hey. There she is. There she is.

17:45.216 --> 17:47.317
Rayann!

17:47.351 --> 17:48.919
- [Normal voice] Hi.
- Hi.

17:48.986 --> 17:50.120
Well, well.

17:50.154 --> 17:52.322
The dirtbags that represented my sister

17:52.356 --> 17:53.990
are now representing her murderer.

17:54.025 --> 17:55.692
We prefer Peter and Jared.

17:55.727 --> 17:57.294
I have nothing to say to you.

17:57.328 --> 18:00.130
You are money-hungry bloodsuckers.

18:00.164 --> 18:01.831
First, nice dog.

18:01.866 --> 18:04.201
But like you, we just want
to know who killed Noelle.

18:04.235 --> 18:05.702
Oh, well, here's a clue...

18:05.803 --> 18:08.071
you're sitting next to him in court.

18:08.105 --> 18:10.907
See, someone else was in her
building the night she died,

18:10.975 --> 18:12.810
someone who knew about her allergy

18:12.844 --> 18:14.011
and when her food was delivered.

18:14.045 --> 18:15.913
What are you talking about?

18:15.947 --> 18:18.816
We have a witness who
puts you there at 3:30 A.M.

18:18.850 --> 18:21.752
You think I killed her? I am
the one who took care of her,

18:21.820 --> 18:24.121
quit my job when she was diagnosed.

18:24.156 --> 18:26.057
And traveled with her
to the Amazon both times.

18:26.091 --> 18:28.159
Did you suggest that Noelle defraud Wendell

18:28.193 --> 18:29.694
by selling her insurance policy,

18:29.728 --> 18:30.862
even though she was cured?

18:30.896 --> 18:32.830
I did... that was Noelle's id...

18:32.864 --> 18:34.165
I don't have to talk to you.

18:34.199 --> 18:36.200
Okay, well, you could do
it here or on the stand.

18:38.404 --> 18:40.205
That is a stupid-looking dog.

18:40.239 --> 18:42.007
[Dog barking, growling]

18:42.041 --> 18:44.376
- You shouldn't have insulted her.
- [Sighs]

18:45.845 --> 18:47.112
[Dog barks]

18:47.180 --> 18:49.414
- Good Lulu.
- [Sweetly] That's a good Lulu.

18:49.449 --> 18:51.116
Dogs can sense evil.

18:51.184 --> 18:54.085
[Normal voice] I think
that's earthquakes, buddy.

18:54.120 --> 18:57.022
It doesn't take a dog to
see that is an angry woman.

18:57.056 --> 18:59.391
Angry enough to kill her sister?

19:05.998 --> 19:08.466
Did you know that the medieval French

19:08.533 --> 19:11.268
believed that the first
beesting of the year

19:11.303 --> 19:14.071
meant that a stranger was en route?

19:14.106 --> 19:16.407
[Doorbell rings] And here we are.

19:16.441 --> 19:18.409
[Chuckles] I can't
believe I'm gonna say this,

19:18.443 --> 19:21.945
but Rachel told me that Bash
and Franklin were coming on.

19:22.013 --> 19:23.780
No, no, no. I overruled that.

19:23.815 --> 19:26.283
- They're far too busy.
- Oh, really?

19:26.317 --> 19:28.985
So, okay, because of your African epiphany,

19:29.053 --> 19:30.721
now we're knocking on Venice doors,

19:30.755 --> 19:32.289
and they get to handle murder trials?

19:32.323 --> 19:35.492
Damien, listen, I wanted on this.

19:35.559 --> 19:36.993
I feel that you and I

19:37.061 --> 19:39.396
have not been on the best of terms

19:39.430 --> 19:41.031
since I brought on Rachel.

19:41.065 --> 19:43.166
I mean, you're my nephew.

19:43.234 --> 19:45.101
Family comes first.

19:45.136 --> 19:46.370
[Door opens]

19:46.404 --> 19:48.271
Goody! You're here!

19:48.306 --> 19:50.340
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

19:50.408 --> 19:53.310
The city says you're running
a commercial operation

19:53.344 --> 19:54.978
out of a residence by selling your honey.

19:55.013 --> 19:58.248
My neighbor sells tomatoes
that he grows in his garden.

19:58.283 --> 20:00.450
Why isn't anyone coming after him?

20:00.485 --> 20:03.787
Because tomatoes don't attack people?

20:03.821 --> 20:06.456
Bees pollinate 30% of the world's crops.

20:06.490 --> 20:09.058
Nearly a third of the honeybees
in the U.S. have vanished

20:09.092 --> 20:10.760
due to the colony collapse disorder.

20:10.828 --> 20:13.429
Absolutely. And not to mention,
of course, that honey...

20:13.464 --> 20:15.965
a very powerful aphrodisiac.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.467
- Did you know that, Damien?
- [Chuckles]

20:17.501 --> 20:18.535
- I do now. Thank you.
- Good.

20:18.602 --> 20:20.570
Each hive has its own personality.

20:20.605 --> 20:24.107
- These little guys recognize me and I them.
- [Bees buzzing]

20:24.141 --> 20:25.508
And the time we spend together

20:25.542 --> 20:27.343
- means as much to me as if...
- [smack]

20:27.377 --> 20:29.812
Oh. [Gasps]

20:29.846 --> 20:31.113
Sorry.

20:31.148 --> 20:32.315
I didn't really have much of a choice.

20:32.349 --> 20:33.916
It came at me like a kamikaze.

20:33.951 --> 20:36.953
She was introducing herself to you.

20:36.988 --> 20:39.156
Well, I was just introducing
myself right back.

20:39.190 --> 20:41.325
I just said, "hey, bee, meet death.

20:41.359 --> 20:43.026
Death, meet bee."

20:43.060 --> 20:45.228
She had a name.

20:45.262 --> 20:47.831
She had a name?

20:47.865 --> 20:49.465
Yeah.

20:49.500 --> 20:52.035
Summer, I do believe I've figured out

20:52.070 --> 20:53.837
how to win your case.

20:53.871 --> 20:56.573
Defense calls Rayann Gardner
to the stand, Your Honor.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.044
Dickheads.

21:02.079 --> 21:03.345
That's just hurtful, Rayann.

21:03.380 --> 21:04.447
She shouldn't have called you that.

21:04.481 --> 21:06.816
Me? She said, "dickheads," plural.

21:06.850 --> 21:10.253
Witness testimony puts you
at Noelle's apartment building

21:10.321 --> 21:12.222
the morning of her death,

21:12.256 --> 21:15.992
but you weren't there to
see your sister, were you?

21:16.027 --> 21:17.994
No.

21:18.029 --> 21:19.830
Who were you there to see?

21:19.897 --> 21:21.865
Michael Shepperd.

21:21.933 --> 21:24.368
Michael Shepperd, your sister's boyfriend,

21:24.402 --> 21:27.504
hours before she died?

21:27.538 --> 21:29.506
Yes.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.908
Objection. Relevance.

21:31.943 --> 21:33.276
All this proves is that Ms. Gardner

21:33.311 --> 21:35.178
had a legitimate reason

21:35.213 --> 21:37.581
to be in the building
other [Scoffs] legitimate?

21:37.615 --> 21:40.017
Sleeping with your sister's boyfriend

21:40.051 --> 21:42.052
while your sister is one floor below?

21:42.086 --> 21:45.122
Objection overruled. Spare
us the outrage, Mr. Bash.

21:45.190 --> 21:46.857
Mr. Nelson may be right.

21:46.892 --> 21:48.926
It may provide a
legitimate reason for Rayann

21:48.960 --> 21:50.528
to be in her sister's building

21:50.562 --> 21:53.397
or motive for her to kill...

21:53.432 --> 21:56.634
one of the oldest motives in the world...

21:56.702 --> 21:58.069
love.

21:59.404 --> 22:01.338
So you're a liar or a murderer.

22:03.308 --> 22:05.276
Either way, Rayann,

22:05.310 --> 22:07.444
why should this jury
believe anything you say?

22:09.247 --> 22:11.381
Our trial is looking up.

22:11.449 --> 22:13.550
Rayann looked bad today. Have a beer.

22:13.584 --> 22:15.285
Alcohol affects sleep patterns.

22:15.319 --> 22:17.154
Men who sleep less than six hours a night

22:17.188 --> 22:19.123
are likely to die four
to seven years sooner

22:19.157 --> 22:21.092
than their tee-totaling
counterparts, so, no, thank you.

22:21.159 --> 22:22.960
We got to invite him to
every one of our parties.

22:22.994 --> 22:24.295
Absolutely.

22:24.329 --> 22:26.997
Is there anything else that I can get you?

22:27.032 --> 22:29.066
You know, I would love a snapple.

22:29.101 --> 22:31.402
I noticed you drinking one
the last time I was here.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.304
Coming right up.

22:36.175 --> 22:37.475
Okay, what is the deal?

22:37.509 --> 22:38.576
What... is it hypnosis?

22:38.610 --> 22:40.211
Is it pheromones? What?

22:40.245 --> 22:41.479
What are you talking about?

22:41.513 --> 22:43.481
We've seen the way that women look at you,

22:43.515 --> 22:44.649
including Carmen.

22:44.683 --> 22:46.617
And let's face it... she lives with this.

22:46.652 --> 22:48.086
- This.
- This.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.687
And this.

22:49.722 --> 22:51.389
- This.
- Eh...

22:51.423 --> 22:53.158
- That.
- Mm...

22:53.192 --> 22:55.193
I don't... I don't know, guys.

22:55.228 --> 22:56.995
I'm... I'm just myself.

22:57.029 --> 22:58.697
- He's good.
- [Laughing] Oh, come on.

22:58.731 --> 23:00.532
No one's themselves.

23:00.566 --> 23:03.301
Hey, Nelson's here.

23:05.371 --> 23:08.607
- White flag?
- Yeah. Let's go check.

23:08.641 --> 23:10.642
If you dismiss now,

23:10.677 --> 23:13.445
we won't sue you for malicious prosecution.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.480
Well, gentlemen, six hours ago,

23:15.515 --> 23:19.117
I might have agreed with
you, until I got this.

23:19.152 --> 23:20.485
What is that?

23:20.520 --> 23:22.621
Life settlements
orchestrated by your client

23:22.656 --> 23:24.156
at his previous job.

23:24.190 --> 23:26.692
So? It's what he does.
He did dozens of them.

23:26.726 --> 23:29.729
I'm focusing on two of them for now.

23:29.763 --> 23:32.431
He bought a policy from a triathlete,

23:32.466 --> 23:35.468
peak of health, who died one month later...

23:35.536 --> 23:37.671
hit and run, never solved.

23:37.738 --> 23:39.506
And an 85-year-old woman who died

23:39.573 --> 23:42.676
one hour after Wendell
visited her in the hospital.

23:42.710 --> 23:45.112
These two untimely deaths

23:45.146 --> 23:49.483
netted Wendell $285,000.

23:49.518 --> 23:51.285
This will never come into evidence.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.688
You can't introduce alleged prior bad acts.

23:53.722 --> 23:57.025
- You're suggesting Wendell is...
- Is a serial killer

23:57.059 --> 24:01.230
who uses life settlements
as a pool for his victims.

24:03.066 --> 24:05.400
Modus operandi. Continuous
course of conduct.

24:05.435 --> 24:08.504
My guess is it will be
admitted for the jury to hear.

24:08.538 --> 24:11.407
And an affidavit from Noelle's boyfriend.

24:11.441 --> 24:14.577
It says that he met Rayann

24:14.611 --> 24:17.413
at the front of their
building at 3:30 A.M.,

24:17.447 --> 24:20.149
where there was no food-delivery bag

24:20.183 --> 24:24.354
and that he stayed with Rayann
until late the next morning.

24:24.388 --> 24:26.723
That's it?

24:26.758 --> 24:28.392
Mm...

24:28.426 --> 24:30.695
One more little thing.

24:30.762 --> 24:33.697
Manslaughter? Mnh-mnh.

24:33.732 --> 24:35.733
First-degree murder.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.068
I'll see you fellas in court.

24:42.641 --> 24:46.178
Either Wendell is the best
actuary in the world...

24:46.212 --> 24:49.782
Or he is a pathological serial killer.

24:49.816 --> 24:51.617
I was gonna say that.

24:55.345 --> 24:56.578
You lied to us, Wendell.

24:56.645 --> 24:58.012
Who are these people
you wrote policies for?

24:58.047 --> 25:00.081
The triathlete was from Portland

25:00.115 --> 25:02.016
but moved to the
third-most-polluted county

25:02.050 --> 25:03.717
in the U.S. with no bike lanes.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.119
I knew the odds of him getting hit by a car

25:06.153 --> 25:08.422
or contracting an airborne disease

25:08.456 --> 25:11.791
could shorten his life by 42.556%.

25:11.826 --> 25:14.828
And he was hit by a car, so I was right.

25:14.862 --> 25:16.496
And the woman?

25:16.531 --> 25:19.800
She was a lonely widow
who regularly called 911

25:19.834 --> 25:21.868
so she could be in a
hospital with other people.

25:21.936 --> 25:25.039
Widows die younger than
their married counterparts,

25:25.073 --> 25:28.710
and over 195,000 Americans die annually

25:28.744 --> 25:30.411
from hospital negligence.

25:30.446 --> 25:33.548
Wendell simply saw them
as a sound investment.

25:33.583 --> 25:35.150
Can't you explain that to the jury?

25:35.184 --> 25:38.053
Actually, Wendell...

25:38.088 --> 25:39.955
we're thinking you should consider a deal.

25:39.990 --> 25:41.924
We may be able to get it knocked down

25:41.958 --> 25:43.592
to involuntary manslaughter...

25:43.627 --> 25:45.161
3 to 5.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.530
3 to 5?

25:47.564 --> 25:48.831
Years?

25:48.865 --> 25:49.965
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.634
But I didn't kill her...

25:51.668 --> 25:53.436
and I can't take a plea.

25:54.771 --> 25:56.605
How about this?

25:56.673 --> 25:58.007
You are a ghoul,

25:58.041 --> 26:00.709
a freak who can predict
the time and circumstance

26:00.744 --> 26:03.011
of anyone's death with
frightening accuracy,

26:03.079 --> 26:04.614
which doesn't make you a killer.

26:04.648 --> 26:07.083
It makes you the best
damn actuary in the world,

26:07.118 --> 26:10.086
and those deaths... those are the proof.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.589
Those skills don't make you homicidal.

26:12.623 --> 26:15.725
They're what make you so good at your job.

26:15.759 --> 26:18.094
Could it work?

26:20.730 --> 26:22.832
Look, we've come to these
hearings in good faith,

26:22.866 --> 26:24.033
but last night, someone destroyed

26:24.101 --> 26:26.101
Ms. Wallace's home apiaries.

26:26.136 --> 26:28.503
Now, she's gonna need protection
until this case is decided.

26:28.537 --> 26:30.972
Lyle: It's true... a few
teenagers who had too much to drink

26:31.040 --> 26:32.874
came upon Ms. Wallace's hives.

26:32.908 --> 26:35.076
The bees attacked, landing
two of the teenagers

26:35.110 --> 26:36.644
- in the hospital.
- W... wait they came upon?

26:36.679 --> 26:37.846
They were trespassing.

26:37.913 --> 26:39.147
You can't kick a dog in his own backyard

26:39.182 --> 26:40.449
and not expect to get bitten.

26:40.483 --> 26:42.184
You can't compare bees to a pet dog.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.086
Actually, you can.

26:44.121 --> 26:46.656
There's a study out of
the University of Michigan

26:46.690 --> 26:49.893
which found that pets make
our lives more fulfilled

26:49.927 --> 26:51.695
and improve mental health,

26:51.763 --> 26:53.797
so given that criteria,

26:53.831 --> 26:57.534
I believe that summer's bees are pets.

26:57.602 --> 26:58.869
Lyle?

26:58.903 --> 27:00.470
He's right. Those bees are pets.

27:00.505 --> 27:01.838
- Great.
- Well, then, if we all agree...

27:01.873 --> 27:04.174
Dangerous pets... now, if
I trespass on your property

27:04.208 --> 27:06.042
and you have a tiger,
that's still a violation

27:06.143 --> 27:07.611
- of the exotic animals act.
- Come on!

27:07.645 --> 27:09.112
Bees can hardly be compared to tigers.

27:09.147 --> 27:10.881
Well, tell that to the
two high-school sophomores

27:10.915 --> 27:12.582
- who had to spend the night in the hospital.
- Okay!

27:12.617 --> 27:14.251
Getting a little contentious up in here.

27:14.285 --> 27:15.819
Let's call it a day,

27:15.853 --> 27:18.789
and we'll hear closing arguments tomorrow.

27:22.794 --> 27:25.028
Hey, heads up... just so you guys know,

27:25.063 --> 27:27.631
if you lose, the teens'
families are bringing civil suit

27:27.699 --> 27:29.066
for their medical bills,
pain and suffering,

27:29.101 --> 27:30.501
and criminal charges.

27:30.536 --> 27:32.136
Sorry, guys.

27:32.171 --> 27:33.805
Oh, my God.

27:33.839 --> 27:35.273
W... wait, Summer.

27:35.307 --> 27:37.742
Well, look, Rachel's gonna be very upset

27:37.810 --> 27:39.110
when you tell her.

27:39.145 --> 27:40.678
- Me?
- Well, yeah.

27:40.713 --> 27:42.647
I mean, you are the first chair.

27:42.715 --> 27:46.218
I'm only here to support
and to heal our relationship.

27:46.252 --> 27:49.120
Great job on that so far.

27:51.224 --> 27:53.192
You know the government
can hack into your computer,

27:53.226 --> 27:55.928
activate your webcam, and watch you?

27:55.962 --> 27:57.229
Thinking of doing that with Charlie's?

27:57.263 --> 27:59.565
'Cause... it seems a little crazy.

27:59.599 --> 28:02.000
First of all, no. Second
of all, great idea.

28:02.035 --> 28:04.169
Third, crazy is another name for passion.

28:04.203 --> 28:05.937
It's how I landed Janie.

28:06.005 --> 28:08.206
I forgot you intentionally
rear-ended her with your car.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.041
Charlie's nothing like Janie, though,

28:10.075 --> 28:11.742
so take it easy with her.

28:11.776 --> 28:13.544
Oh, the things we do for love.

28:13.578 --> 28:17.080
Well, we didn't talk about
this Noelle/wendell thing.

28:17.115 --> 28:19.716
What if someone's jealous
of their relationship?

28:19.750 --> 28:20.950
Well, it wasn't Noelle's boyfriend.

28:21.018 --> 28:22.252
He was banging the sister.

28:22.286 --> 28:24.921
What if it's not about Noelle?

28:24.955 --> 28:27.624
Wendell oddly attracts
women you're saying someone

28:27.658 --> 28:29.059
could have been jealous of him?

28:29.126 --> 28:31.761
The insurance papers came
from his previous job.

28:31.862 --> 28:34.130
There's only one person
who's been with him all along.

28:34.231 --> 28:36.299
His assistant, Jill.

28:36.334 --> 28:39.569
Except she's been helpful,
volunteering information.

28:39.604 --> 28:41.571
What better way to stay close to the case?

28:41.606 --> 28:42.939
What if Jill loves Wendell enough

28:43.007 --> 28:44.041
to do something crazy?

28:44.075 --> 28:45.609
Yeah, she would have hated

28:45.643 --> 28:47.644
seeing that relationship
unfold with Noelle.

28:47.678 --> 28:49.579
- She would have known about the banana allergy.
- Yeah.

28:49.614 --> 28:51.615
So we put the high beams on Jill.

28:51.649 --> 28:53.750
In my office.

28:53.785 --> 28:55.252
We're now.

28:57.656 --> 28:59.123
Everything all right?

28:59.157 --> 29:02.126
I need you to win the bee case. Excuse us?

29:02.160 --> 29:05.029
It seems to be baffling
those above your pay grade.

29:05.064 --> 29:06.998
Well, everything baffles Karp.

29:07.066 --> 29:08.833
Why can't you do it?

29:08.868 --> 29:10.869
I can't be directly involved.

29:10.903 --> 29:12.270
Because...?

29:14.174 --> 29:15.908
We work better when we're not in the dark.

29:15.943 --> 29:17.610
- Eh...
- At the office.

29:17.644 --> 29:19.145
Fine.

29:19.213 --> 29:21.080
I have a goddaughter, Gloria...

29:21.115 --> 29:25.051
a smart, dedicated kid whose
mom is barely scraping by.

29:25.085 --> 29:26.819
She'd excel at Beechem,

29:26.853 --> 29:28.721
but her mom refuses to take money from me.

29:28.755 --> 29:29.889
She's just too proud.

29:29.923 --> 29:31.657
- We're not as proud.
- No.

29:31.692 --> 29:32.959
And Summer, the beekeeper,

29:32.993 --> 29:35.294
sits on the admissions committee.

29:35.328 --> 29:37.863
Hang on... you've been busting our balls

29:37.931 --> 29:39.598
for doing too many pro bono cases.

29:39.632 --> 29:41.600
Now you want us to help
out with the honeybees

29:41.634 --> 29:43.836
so your friend's kid can
get into some private school?

29:43.903 --> 29:45.404
Yes.

29:45.438 --> 29:47.173
- Okay.
- When can we start pulling stuff like that?

29:47.207 --> 29:49.976
Raise your billables 500%

29:50.010 --> 29:52.144
and argue a case in front
of the supreme court,

29:52.179 --> 29:53.980
and we'll discuss it.

29:54.014 --> 29:55.114
Why us?

29:55.148 --> 29:57.116
The Venice community association

29:57.150 --> 29:58.618
is a different kind of cat.

29:58.652 --> 29:59.318
You'd fit right in.

29:59.353 --> 30:00.920
Sounds like an insult.

30:00.955 --> 30:02.789
Nah. We can't do it. Can't do it tomorrow.

30:02.823 --> 30:04.657
We have that murder trial.

30:04.725 --> 30:07.726
Can you teach Stanton and
Damien the Franklin and Bash?

30:07.761 --> 30:09.294
[Both laugh]

30:09.329 --> 30:12.230
- Can you teach a one-armed man to drum?
- [Laughs]

30:12.264 --> 30:14.165
Def Leppard.

30:14.233 --> 30:16.735
I said one arm.

30:16.803 --> 30:18.838
No. Wait, wait, wait.

30:18.872 --> 30:22.875
Karp and bees.

30:22.909 --> 30:24.777
- Killer bees?
- No.

30:24.845 --> 30:26.212
Damn. Ah, damn.

30:26.313 --> 30:28.381
I'm told Summer's honeybees are harmless.

30:28.416 --> 30:31.051
They don't attack you
if you don't attack them.

30:31.085 --> 30:33.988
They're harmless unless provoked.

30:34.022 --> 30:36.390
And that's what you would
need to prove to win.

30:40.262 --> 30:44.031
If we do it, take down that wall?

30:44.065 --> 30:46.967
If you do it, you can have another case.

30:47.002 --> 30:49.203
That's why they call it a job.

30:49.237 --> 30:51.906
A job.

30:51.940 --> 30:52.940
They do need our help.

30:53.008 --> 30:55.409
Not "they," just Infeld.

30:55.443 --> 30:58.912
Right. Just Infeld.

30:59.013 --> 31:01.681
- Def Leppard.
- One-armed drummer, yes.

31:01.749 --> 31:03.283
How was he charged with assault?

31:03.350 --> 31:05.418
He's got a strong one arm.

31:27.073 --> 31:28.807
- Hey. Check it.
- Hey.

31:28.841 --> 31:30.075
What is it?

31:30.109 --> 31:31.977
E-mail exchange between Jill and Noelle

31:32.011 --> 31:33.411
from a year ago, right after her cure.

31:33.446 --> 31:34.913
Read it and weep.

31:34.947 --> 31:36.348
"I wanted to tell you a quick e-mail.

31:36.382 --> 31:37.949
I wanted to tell you
about feast food service,

31:37.984 --> 31:39.484
especially with you on a new health kick.

31:39.519 --> 31:41.887
They deal with food allergies
and deliver to your door

31:41.955 --> 31:44.757
between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M."

31:44.791 --> 31:46.192
Smoking banana.

31:46.226 --> 31:47.994
Jill knew about the food allergy

31:48.028 --> 31:49.729
and the time of the food delivery.

31:49.763 --> 31:51.830
She's the only other
person other than Wendell

31:51.865 --> 31:54.867
who knew about those dead-life
settlements that the D.A. had.

31:54.934 --> 31:57.269
Only one problem.

31:57.337 --> 31:58.804
- The firewall.
- Yep.

31:58.839 --> 32:00.106
The judge is never gonna
let us bring anything

32:00.140 --> 32:02.441
from Wendell's civil case against Noelle.

32:02.476 --> 32:04.877
It's prejudicial. Nelson will nail it.

32:04.912 --> 32:07.413
We can't bring it in, but that
doesn't mean the prosecution can't.

32:07.448 --> 32:10.183
We get them to knock down the firewall.

32:10.217 --> 32:12.352
Easier than knocking down this wall.

32:12.386 --> 32:14.020
Hey.

32:14.055 --> 32:15.088
Huh? Tag, you're it.

Yeah, I'd love to.

33:02.656 --> 33:05.724
And Tess' dad isn't picking
her up till next weekend.

33:05.759 --> 33:08.727
You want me to meet your daughter?

No, of course not.

33:40.830 --> 33:42.664
Yeah, it was.

33:42.681 --> 33:45.016
And you sent this new diagnosis
to her life-insurance company

33:45.051 --> 33:46.451
on September 1st of this year?

33:46.519 --> 33:48.353
Yep, I sent the good news directly

33:48.421 --> 33:49.921
to Mr. Singletary's office.

33:49.955 --> 33:51.756
In your experience, how do patients

33:51.790 --> 33:53.425
celebrate good news like that?

33:53.459 --> 33:56.127
Well, some cash out their
savings and go on trips.

33:56.106 --> 33:58.540
A few get married and have babies.

33:58.608 --> 34:00.675
A handful start treating their bodies worse

34:00.710 --> 34:01.910
than when they were diagnosed.

34:01.944 --> 34:03.712
Which category did Noelle fit into?

34:03.746 --> 34:06.514
Objection. Relevance. Overruled.

34:06.549 --> 34:09.751
She gained several pounds
and exhibited some...

34:09.784 --> 34:11.418
reckless behavior.

34:11.453 --> 34:15.489
In fact, Noelle bought
several cases of junk food

34:15.524 --> 34:17.491
as recently as a week
before her death, didn't she?

34:17.525 --> 34:19.326
Objection. Relevance again.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.328
A copy of a receipt of multiple cases

34:21.362 --> 34:24.030
of Ho Ho, Ding-Dongs,
and Twinkies, Your Honor.

34:24.065 --> 34:25.032
[Clear throat]

34:25.099 --> 34:26.667
Judge: Proceed.

34:26.734 --> 34:29.369
Doctor, Twinkies were
made in the same factory

34:29.402 --> 34:31.371
as banana-cream-filled zingers.

34:31.405 --> 34:33.373
Now, couldn't traces of zinger juice

34:33.408 --> 34:34.074
- possibly...
- Objection.

34:34.109 --> 34:39.713
Ms. Gardner had food delivered
to her daily from Feast,

34:39.748 --> 34:43.650
a company that provides
locally sourced organic food.

34:43.685 --> 34:46.353
She was very vigilant in her diet.

34:46.388 --> 34:48.556
Well, Your Honor, since opposing counsel

34:48.590 --> 34:51.091
has introduced the idea of
Ms. Gardner's healthy diet,

34:51.126 --> 34:54.761
information used in
the prior civil trial...

34:54.795 --> 34:57.998
- Wait, wait. No, no, no.
- They opened the door.

34:58.032 --> 35:01.501
We request the right to
make use of that information.

35:01.535 --> 35:04.804
- Granted. Consider the door open.
- Oh.

35:04.871 --> 35:06.906
The court will recess until 2:00 P.M.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.073
[Gavel bangs]

35:10.143 --> 35:13.111
Uh, Damien, um, listen, before we go in,

35:13.146 --> 35:16.882
I'd just like to say that
working with you on this case

35:16.916 --> 35:19.918
reminds me of why I hired
you in the first place,

35:19.953 --> 35:22.654
and it's not because your
mother tried to blackmail me

35:22.722 --> 35:24.656
over that ridiculous incident

35:24.724 --> 35:25.991
with the hitchhiker in Amsterdam.

35:26.059 --> 35:29.829
No, listen I hired you because
you're a damn fine lawyer.

35:29.896 --> 35:31.764
Thank you.

35:31.798 --> 35:35.935
And by hiring Rachel, I
suppose that, subconsciously,

35:35.970 --> 35:39.005
I believed that you'd be
better suited somewhere else,

35:39.073 --> 35:40.807
you know, like a... a judge

35:40.841 --> 35:43.943
or a legal counsel to
a Fortune 500 company.

35:43.977 --> 35:45.745
I'm sorry. What... what are you saying?

35:45.779 --> 35:49.015
What I'm saying is, for you
to get to the next level,

35:49.082 --> 35:50.549
you have to take risks.

35:50.584 --> 35:51.917
You have to take chances.

35:51.952 --> 35:54.186
No. Not taking risks
has gotten me where I am.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.722
You don't have a choice. I mean, Rachel...

35:56.756 --> 35:58.023
she really wants this,

35:58.057 --> 35:59.992
<i>and you know how I hate to lose.</i>

36:00.026 --> 36:02.794
So I just have one question for you...

36:02.829 --> 36:05.464
do you have any allergies?

36:06.966 --> 36:10.636
Most of you know bees as social insects.

36:10.671 --> 36:12.938
I mean, they gather to do their work.

36:12.973 --> 36:16.142
They protect their queen as a group.

36:16.176 --> 36:18.877
Now, what most of you don't know about them

36:18.912 --> 36:22.481
is that they're gentle,
defensive creatures.

36:22.515 --> 36:24.816
They'll only attack if provoked.

36:24.851 --> 36:26.752
And they're harmless,

36:26.786 --> 36:29.221
unless, of course, you harm them.

36:29.255 --> 36:32.557
Well, as you can see for yourself...

36:32.592 --> 36:33.892
right, Damien?

36:33.960 --> 36:35.660
[Bees buzzing]

36:44.602 --> 36:47.299
You've been Wendell Singletary's
assistant for how long?

36:47.790 --> 36:49.528
6 years, 2 months, 13 days. 

36:49.968 --> 36:51.235
How many hours?

36:51.269 --> 36:53.437
10,496, if you're counting weekends,

36:53.505 --> 36:55.206
8,000 if you're counting weekdays

36:55.240 --> 36:57.241
with no personal, sick, or vacation days.

36:57.275 --> 36:59.176
You really are Wendell's protégée.

36:59.210 --> 37:01.345
Well, Wendell's an excellent boss.

37:01.379 --> 37:03.213
And you worked with Wendell when he handled

37:03.248 --> 37:05.048
the life settlements for the triathlete

37:05.083 --> 37:07.417
and the 85-year-old back at health assure.

37:07.451 --> 37:10.186
Wendell and I work very closely together.

37:10.221 --> 37:12.288
I wonder... do you know how the prosecution

37:12.323 --> 37:14.457
- got ahold of those cases?
- No.

37:14.492 --> 37:16.393
Was there anyone who
worked with you and Wendell

37:16.460 --> 37:18.428
at health assure who came
over to life-systems with you?

37:18.463 --> 37:19.897
No.

37:19.965 --> 37:22.933
- Just you.
- Yes.

37:22.967 --> 37:25.970
And you worked on Noelle's
life settlement, too, right?

37:26.038 --> 37:27.938
And you and Noelle e-mailed.

37:27.973 --> 37:30.107
Well, I e-mail most of Wendell's clients.

37:30.141 --> 37:32.043
I'm interested in one specific exchange

37:32.077 --> 37:35.247
where you introduced Noelle
to feast delivery service.

37:35.281 --> 37:37.849
So you knew the delivery-service times,

37:37.917 --> 37:40.319
and you also knew about Noelle's allergy.

37:42.055 --> 37:43.889
Given your actuarial skills,

37:43.924 --> 37:45.157
I'm wondering if you can help me analyze

37:45.192 --> 37:46.526
some research I've gathered.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.561
Uh, between women and men,

37:48.596 --> 37:51.264
women take their time to plan a murder,

37:51.332 --> 37:54.267
while men are more... impulsive.

37:54.302 --> 37:57.571
Now, men tend to kill
people that they don't know,

37:57.672 --> 38:00.340
while women tend to kill people

38:00.408 --> 38:02.076
that they have some personal connection to.

38:02.110 --> 38:03.077
Is that right?

38:03.111 --> 38:05.012
That's correct.

38:05.047 --> 38:07.849
And, typically, poison is a woman's weapon.

38:07.883 --> 38:12.353
And women, more than
men, kill most for love.

38:12.388 --> 38:13.555
Did you know that?

38:15.257 --> 38:16.691
If... if you say so.

38:19.328 --> 38:21.563
Jill, are you in love with Wendell?

38:26.301 --> 38:28.636
No.

38:28.670 --> 38:32.473
Not for the last 10,496 hours,

38:32.574 --> 38:34.108
counting weekends,

38:34.142 --> 38:35.576
or 8,000, counting only workdays,

38:35.611 --> 38:37.945
no vacation, personal, or sick days?

38:39.347 --> 38:41.115
You're under oath.

38:41.182 --> 38:43.984
I'm not in love with Wendell, so...

38:47.255 --> 38:50.156
He didn't notice you at all, did he?

38:50.190 --> 38:53.059
Given your professional expertise,

38:53.093 --> 38:55.294
what are the odds that Wendell, a man,

38:55.328 --> 38:57.329
planned a murder by poison

38:57.363 --> 39:01.133
of a woman he admitted to having
an intimate relationship with?

39:01.168 --> 39:04.403
750 to 1.

39:06.307 --> 39:08.241
Using those exact same facts,

39:08.276 --> 39:10.310
what are the odds that the real murderer...

39:10.344 --> 39:12.178
is you?

39:17.284 --> 39:20.487
No more questions.

39:23.290 --> 39:26.459
The community association
is gonna take a look

39:26.493 --> 39:29.629
at all ordinances making
beekeeping illegal,

39:29.663 --> 39:32.498
so summer gets to keep her hives.

39:32.533 --> 39:35.035
And Gloria has an interview
with Beechem Prep...

39:35.103 --> 39:37.337
- Ah.
-... Thanks to you.

39:37.371 --> 39:39.639
It was our pleasure.

39:41.442 --> 39:43.643
Uh, Damien, it's all right.

39:43.678 --> 39:45.712
- They're gone.
- Mm-hmm.

39:45.780 --> 39:47.981
Damien, y... listen,

39:48.016 --> 39:49.183
- you and I...
- Yeah.

39:49.217 --> 39:50.551
- We're good, right?
- Stop. Yes.

39:50.652 --> 39:51.985
- We're good?
- I hear buzzing.

39:52.020 --> 39:53.320
Did you hear buzzing?

39:53.354 --> 39:54.521
[Cellphone vibrates]

39:54.555 --> 39:56.656
Ah! How's the murder trial going?

39:56.691 --> 39:59.292
Uh, about to find out.

39:59.327 --> 40:02.629
It's official... D.A. is
dropping all the charges.

40:02.663 --> 40:04.531
Jill is in custody for Noelle's murder.

40:04.565 --> 40:06.733
Wow. Thank you so much.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.201
What are you gonna do with the $250,000?

40:08.235 --> 40:09.702
'Cause that's yours now.

40:09.736 --> 40:12.705
I think I'm gonna quit
my job and move to Italy.

40:12.739 --> 40:15.675
Maybe we could hit a bar nearby.

40:15.709 --> 40:18.044
Celebratory glass of prosecco on me.

40:18.079 --> 40:20.247
I thought you said alcohol
shortened your life.

40:20.281 --> 40:22.349
Well, some studies show
that, in moderation,

40:22.384 --> 40:23.651
it actually has health benefits.

40:23.719 --> 40:26.220
More importantly, what good is life

40:26.288 --> 40:28.723
if you're always calculating
the worst possible outcome?

40:28.757 --> 40:32.193
I know a place right around the corner.

40:32.228 --> 40:34.529
Join us. Please say no.

40:34.563 --> 40:36.164
You kids go on.

40:36.198 --> 40:38.033
We're good.

40:38.067 --> 40:40.402
- I could go for a cigar right about now.
- Yeah?

40:40.436 --> 40:42.237
Maybe Infeld has one of those Hondurans.

40:42.271 --> 40:43.338
Not feeling it.

40:43.372 --> 40:44.773
Huh. Yeah.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.508
Well, there's a box of
Twinkies with our names on it.

40:46.542 --> 40:47.742
That'll work.

40:47.844 --> 40:49.277
[Telephone rings]

40:52.515 --> 40:54.583
All right! Oh, there we go.

40:54.617 --> 40:57.086
Rachel took the wall down. Dude!

40:57.187 --> 40:58.720
- This... look at this!
- [Sighs]

40:58.755 --> 41:00.389
It's so hard to get a read on her.

41:00.423 --> 41:02.057
Right? Friend or foe?

41:02.092 --> 41:04.527
- It's like a jedi mind bone.
- Yep.

41:04.561 --> 41:07.497
- Still...
- I know, but this is how we get our best work done.

41:07.531 --> 41:08.531
That's right.

41:08.565 --> 41:10.733
Hey.

41:10.767 --> 41:12.735
[Laughs]

41:14.204 --> 41:16.404
Oh. What? What?

41:21.243 --> 41:22.610
Aah!

41:22.644 --> 41:24.078
What? What you got?

41:26.815 --> 41:28.116
Where'd you get the...

41:28.150 --> 41:29.050
Aah!
