00:00.125 --> 00:02.468
Today we are welcoming a delegation

00:02.593 --> 00:05.171
from the parks department
of our sister city,

00:05.470 --> 00:07.305
Boraqua, Venezuela.

00:07.801 --> 00:10.593
Our photo-op with the mayor
is tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.,

00:10.946 --> 00:14.263
so I'm going to need your suggestions
about my wardrobe asap.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.104
I told you...
Gold-sequined sweatpants.

00:17.229 --> 00:18.934
Also, remember, everyone,

00:19.440 --> 00:21.520
Venezuela is a poor country.

00:22.154 --> 00:23.397
These men are not used

00:23.741 --> 00:26.984
to the wealth and flash that we
have here in central Indiana.

00:27.730 --> 00:31.617
Our only job over the next two days
is to make these men feel at home.

00:31.742 --> 00:33.592
Yes, I am a little nervous.

00:34.307 --> 00:37.119
Pawnee has kind of a tricky history

00:37.288 --> 00:39.404
with welcoming foreign visitors.

00:41.334 --> 00:42.757
But things have changed.

00:42.882 --> 00:45.882
Our guests are going to stay
in a motel for sure.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.091
Oh, God, what if they
don't speak english?

01:10.216 --> 01:12.029
April, you know spanish, right?

01:16.743 --> 01:18.293
Oh, good.
Excellent.

01:19.007 --> 01:20.601
My mom's Puerto Rican.

01:20.726 --> 01:23.176
That's why I'm so lively
and colorful.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.711
Oh, my God. Here they are.
Okay, everybody, clean up.

01:27.149 --> 01:29.799
Pull your thing up.
Everyone just be good.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.621
Jerry, hit it.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.343
This is my baby.

01:34.645 --> 01:36.301
I put this whole trip together.

01:36.472 --> 01:38.764
And let me tell you something...
It has not been easy.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.309
You know, how do you fit all
of Pawnee in a 48-hour visit?

01:43.434 --> 01:47.286
I had to drop the rock-and-roll
bowling alley from our itinerary.

01:49.329 --> 01:52.278
One of the most difficult
phone calls I've ever had to make.

01:52.511 --> 01:54.447
Hello, most excellent
representatives

01:54.615 --> 01:57.199
of the great parks department
of Boraqua, Venezuela.

01:57.631 --> 01:59.820
I am deputy director
of Parks and Recreation

01:59.945 --> 02:01.948
and chairwoman
of the departmental ad hoc

02:02.073 --> 02:04.165
subcommittee for Pit Beautification,
Leslie Knope.

02:04.838 --> 02:08.306
It's a pleasure. I am
<i>vice director ejecutivo del diputado</i>

02:08.431 --> 02:09.955
<i>del departamento de parques,</i>

02:10.080 --> 02:12.757
Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro
de Veloso de Maldonado.

02:13.521 --> 02:14.521
I'm Tom.

02:14.964 --> 02:17.419
These are my colleagues,
Antonio Rivera-Fonseca,

02:17.544 --> 02:19.296
minister of small fountains,

02:19.775 --> 02:22.767
and Elvis correja,
administrator of hedges.

02:23.196 --> 02:24.340
And he is?

02:24.543 --> 02:25.831
Pay no attention to him.

02:25.956 --> 02:28.063
He's our intern, Johnny.
He is worthless.

02:28.762 --> 02:30.524
We are quite tired from our trip.

02:30.724 --> 02:32.985
Could you have your servant
collect our bags, please?

02:33.110 --> 02:35.575
- What did he call me?
- It's a different culture, okay?

02:35.700 --> 02:37.355
Just be a good host
and do this for me.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.416
Fine.

02:38.541 --> 02:42.203
Yes, we'll get our pathetic servant boy
to fetch your luggage. Go, boy.

02:43.938 --> 02:45.925
Now, I know you gentlemen
had a long flight,

02:46.050 --> 02:49.043
but I have prepared
a welcome party in your honor.

02:49.241 --> 02:51.091
Excellent, I like to party.

02:51.619 --> 02:53.714
Well, my job is to see
to your every need.

02:54.558 --> 02:57.051
Do we just...
select the woman we desire?

02:58.932 --> 03:00.834
I will take the large black one.

03:00.959 --> 03:02.681
- Interesting choice.
- What?

03:02.849 --> 03:05.742
Do you have some kind of a book
with photos of the women available?

03:05.867 --> 03:08.879
If not, I will also take
the sexy black one.

03:09.934 --> 03:11.572
I am not surprised at all.

03:11.697 --> 03:14.967
I've been to South America.
I did very well there.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.575
There might have been
a translation problem.

03:17.700 --> 03:21.404
When I said party, I meant one
that did not include sex for pay,

03:21.832 --> 03:24.080
but one that had
food and drink and dancing.

03:24.205 --> 03:25.655
That sort of thing.

03:25.896 --> 03:26.871
So no women?

03:29.632 --> 03:31.710
Off to kind of a weird start.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.713
We have so much
to learn from each other.

03:34.838 --> 03:37.299
- What kind of birds do you eat?
- Chickens.

03:38.404 --> 03:40.177
Us too.
Amazing.

03:41.472 --> 03:42.473
What is this?

03:42.724 --> 03:43.598
Water.

03:44.288 --> 03:45.558
I'm sorry... <i>Agua</i>.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.811
In our country government officials
drink only bottled water.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.896
That water's very safe to drink.

03:52.043 --> 03:53.143
No. Bottled.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.916
Please.
Send the boy.

03:55.294 --> 03:56.694
Tom, go get water.

03:57.041 --> 03:59.363
- Leslie, come on.
- For your troubles.

04:01.736 --> 04:03.136
You got it, chief.

04:16.084 --> 04:19.128
- Can you help me out a second?
- Go away, jerry.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.900
This is a gold-plated replica
of a gun Hugo Chavez used

04:32.025 --> 04:34.787
in the 1992 socialist revolution.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.233
It is a gift.

04:36.610 --> 04:40.566
This gun truly symbolizes
the blossoming peace

04:40.691 --> 04:42.377
between our two nations.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.243
A key aspect to diplomacy
is gift-giving.

04:46.458 --> 04:49.904
The gift has to be nice enough
to honor and respect the guest,

04:50.029 --> 04:52.329
but not so nice that it shames him.

04:52.470 --> 04:54.891
Plus, it needs to represent
the local culture.

04:55.016 --> 04:56.545
And I found the perfect thing.

04:56.871 --> 04:59.651
A bottle of high-fructose corn syrup

05:00.391 --> 05:03.228
made right here
in Pawnee's own sweetums factory.

05:03.353 --> 05:06.554
"If you can't beat 'em, sweetums."
Since 1891.

05:06.847 --> 05:10.262
And eight and a half dozen
rubber baby-bottle nipples.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.424
Also made here in Pawnee.

05:12.549 --> 05:14.188
Kernston's rubber nipples.

05:14.399 --> 05:16.172
"Tastes like the real thing."

05:22.498 --> 05:25.824
Yes, and we too are pleased to be here
in your dirty alleyway.

05:26.537 --> 05:29.022
We thank you
for the container of sap

05:29.358 --> 05:30.788
and the bag of garbage.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.379
His english isn't perfect,
so I don't think he realizes

05:33.504 --> 05:35.042
how insulting he's being.

05:35.265 --> 05:38.515
We are also sister cities
with Kaesong, North Korea.

05:38.869 --> 05:40.717
Their town is far nicer.

05:41.201 --> 05:43.801
That's fine. It's my job.
I'm a diplomat.

05:43.978 --> 05:45.636
I'm not supposed
to take it personally.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.680
We haven't been here for a long time,
but what we have seen is

05:48.805 --> 05:51.502
really, from the bottom of our hearts,
truly depressing.

05:51.950 --> 05:53.219
Really, really sad stuff.

05:53.344 --> 05:55.845
I mean, that's why people
respect Hillary Clinton so much,

05:55.970 --> 05:57.982
'cause nobody takes
a punch like her.

05:58.150 --> 06:01.944
She's the strongest, smartest
punching bag in the world.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.977
It's funny because
Antonio said to me,

06:04.102 --> 06:07.088
"can we turn this car around
"and say we're sick or something,

06:07.213 --> 06:08.545
or that we lost our way?"

06:08.670 --> 06:10.769
Of course that would be rude to you.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.916
- What is your profession?
- I'm a city planner.

06:16.927 --> 06:18.527
This city was planned?

06:19.332 --> 06:21.361
On the drive in,
I saw a tattoo parlor

06:21.486 --> 06:23.424
next to a school
next to a Taco Bell.

06:24.370 --> 06:26.719
It looks like it was designed
by a very stupid rodent.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.680
He's actually a pretty smart rodent.

06:31.647 --> 06:33.197
You have a quick wit.

06:34.072 --> 06:36.645
I've changed my mind.
I will have you for the evening.

06:37.885 --> 06:38.939
Oh, boy.

06:39.547 --> 06:41.358
She'll get back to you on that.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.826
Politically, no.

06:43.169 --> 06:44.453
I don't support Chavez.

06:44.578 --> 06:47.228
I despise him
and everything that he does.

06:49.152 --> 06:51.368
On the other hand, this is
a pretty sweet-ass gun.

06:55.151 --> 06:57.249
- The banana you wanted, <i>se√±or</i>.
- Finally.

06:57.465 --> 06:58.465
You peel.

06:59.090 --> 06:59.940
What?

07:00.611 --> 07:01.911
With your hands,

07:02.036 --> 07:03.655
you peel the banana.

07:06.218 --> 07:09.636
Let's get started, shall we?
I have a full day of activities planned.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.773
I would like to see where the children
are fed the sweeteners.

07:12.898 --> 07:13.919
Our restaurant?

07:14.044 --> 07:16.104
American children
are fattened more efficiently

07:16.229 --> 07:18.278
than any other children
in the world.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.413
They're like little basketballs.
I mean, they're huge.

07:21.538 --> 07:22.565
Little porkers.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.494
This is our thermometer.

07:26.240 --> 07:29.281
I'm trying to turn a giant dirt pit
into a community park,

07:29.520 --> 07:31.442
but I need $35,000,

07:31.927 --> 07:34.533
and the city doesn't have
enough money in its budget.

07:34.683 --> 07:37.581
- I do not understand.
- You've never had a budget shortage?

07:44.635 --> 07:47.071
Venezuela is blessed
with massive oil reserves.

07:47.196 --> 07:50.053
Massive, I mean, tremendous,
like you would not believe.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.054
The state sells the oil,

07:52.262 --> 07:53.995
keeps all the money,

07:54.120 --> 07:55.933
and we build whatever we want.

07:58.257 --> 08:00.646
Now I do not understand.

08:04.697 --> 08:06.527
I feel that my English
was very clear.

08:07.011 --> 08:09.154
Shall I repeat?
Venezuela...

08:09.322 --> 08:10.885
Venezuela, my country...

08:11.408 --> 08:14.072
has a lot of oil.
Oil is food for cars.

08:14.452 --> 08:17.077
The Venezuelans
are very confident people.

08:18.707 --> 08:22.501
I know these guys didn't turn out to be
exactly how we thought they would be.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.982
You said they might not know
what toilet paper is.

08:25.107 --> 08:26.380
I'm calling an audible.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.090
We can't be humble anymore.

08:28.378 --> 08:30.633
We're going to take them
to our best park,

08:30.758 --> 08:32.488
and we're gonna blow
their socks off.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.886
I don't think
that's gonna blow their socks off.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.014
We'll go further, to Chicago
and pretend it's part of Pawnee.

08:38.139 --> 08:39.684
Or New York.
Or London!

08:40.133 --> 08:42.614
The money's different.
They'll figure it out. Never mind.

08:42.739 --> 08:43.938
We'll go to the park.

08:44.508 --> 08:47.100
Everybody doing okay back there?
Comfortable?

08:49.815 --> 08:53.006
Well, the motel we're putting you up in
is really nice.

08:53.131 --> 08:54.449
You can watch TBS.

08:55.107 --> 08:56.702
Do you have TBS in Venezuela?

08:57.486 --> 08:59.536
I have everything in Venezuela.

09:00.117 --> 09:02.543
I have four satellite dishes
on my estate.

09:02.668 --> 09:05.076
We get 14,000 channels.

09:06.215 --> 09:07.396
14,000.

09:08.243 --> 09:10.743
I already know
who wins project runway.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.218
I'm coming over to your house, then.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.868
I see what you're getting at.

09:14.993 --> 09:17.598
I am still primarily interested
in the large black woman.

09:23.147 --> 09:25.147
Here we are.
Take it in, boys.

09:25.401 --> 09:27.858
- This is an embarrassment to America.
- I'm sorry?

09:28.040 --> 09:30.731
- You are right to want to correct this.
- Correct what?

09:30.946 --> 09:34.005
This is the giant pit of dirt
you were telling us about, is it not?

09:34.248 --> 09:36.325
The one you want
to turn into a park?

09:38.178 --> 09:41.262
This is already a park.
And it's one of our best-loved parks.

09:41.387 --> 09:43.237
Why are the trees so small?

09:44.058 --> 09:47.002
They're not that small.
Besides, size doesn't matter.

09:47.850 --> 09:49.144
Yes, it does.

09:49.408 --> 09:50.756
Our trees are huge.

09:51.097 --> 09:52.758
We build tunnels through them.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.484
The parks in Boraqua
are far superior.

10:11.102 --> 10:13.111
The park in my hometown,
the parque del este,

10:13.279 --> 10:16.490
we have a monorail,
and we have an aquarium.

10:17.255 --> 10:19.371
And the Jaripa amphitheatre is huge.

10:19.496 --> 10:21.328
Lady Gaga played there last week.

10:21.497 --> 10:23.653
Great, we don't have Lady Gaga.

10:23.778 --> 10:27.873
And I don't think she's gonna come here
unless her career takes a very bad turn.

10:28.171 --> 10:30.908
But we have something
more beautiful than Lady Gaga.

10:31.033 --> 10:32.033
Democracy.

10:32.614 --> 10:35.884
I'm going to show you an example.
Let's go to a town-hall meeting.

10:36.776 --> 10:37.728
Elvis.

10:38.082 --> 10:38.887
Henry!

10:39.602 --> 10:41.682
Raul... butterfinger.

10:42.542 --> 10:45.692
Antonio, Nestle crunch
with the crispy rice removed.

10:46.273 --> 10:48.086
Weird choice, but for you

10:48.515 --> 10:49.912
I got it done.

10:54.859 --> 10:56.363
I find it incredibly demeaning,

10:56.532 --> 10:57.556
but, guess what?

10:57.681 --> 10:59.136
<i>Cash money</i>

10:59.360 --> 11:01.445
<i>I'm going to make it rain</i>

11:03.016 --> 11:04.955
I'm gonna pick that up real quick.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.582
So are you guys ready?
We're about to start.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.418
This is
where you have your meetings?

11:10.005 --> 11:11.553
Well, the location rotates.

11:11.678 --> 11:14.172
Sometimes we have them
on the volleyball courts.

11:16.445 --> 11:17.676
Where do you hold yours?

11:17.886 --> 11:20.514
Well, now that you asked,
we usually rotate as well

11:20.639 --> 11:23.598
between different fortresses
and citadels and palaces.

11:25.140 --> 11:26.476
We don't need palaces.

11:27.311 --> 11:30.057
The ideas are what shine
in our meetings.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.240
What are you, some kind of moron?

11:32.365 --> 11:35.714
Why don't you have hand dryers
in the park bathrooms?

11:35.839 --> 11:39.364
They're so much more sanitary
than paper towels! Anyone knows that!

11:39.532 --> 11:41.519
My dog went to one of your parks

11:41.644 --> 11:43.243
and ate another dog's feces,

11:43.411 --> 11:45.454
and I am going to sue you for that.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.099
How do you like it?

11:47.779 --> 11:49.253
How do you like that?

11:49.869 --> 11:51.668
Now imagine you're holding coffee!

11:52.071 --> 11:53.337
This is outrageous.

11:53.593 --> 11:56.214
Where are the armed men
who come in to take the protestors away?

11:56.339 --> 11:57.174
Where?

11:57.342 --> 12:00.148
This kind of behavior
is never tolerated in Boraqua.

12:00.637 --> 12:03.066
You shout like that,
they put you in jail.

12:03.191 --> 12:04.234
Right away.

12:04.551 --> 12:06.051
No trial, no nothing.

12:06.176 --> 12:08.852
Journalists...
We have a special jail for journalists.

12:08.977 --> 12:10.817
You are stealing...
Right to jail.

12:10.942 --> 12:13.380
You're playing music too loud...
Right to jail. Right away.

12:13.505 --> 12:15.122
You're driving too fast?
Jail.

12:15.247 --> 12:16.168
Slow? Jail.

12:16.293 --> 12:19.046
You're charging
too high prices for sweaters,

12:19.733 --> 12:21.442
glasses, you right to jail.

12:21.567 --> 12:23.880
You undercook fish...
Believe it or not, jail.

12:24.005 --> 12:26.595
You overcook chicken...
Also jail.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.009
Undercook, overcook.

12:28.134 --> 12:30.499
You make an appointment with a dentist
and you don't show up...

12:30.667 --> 12:31.888
Jail, right away.

12:32.013 --> 12:34.139
We have the best patients
in the world...

12:34.264 --> 12:35.564
Because of jail.

12:36.692 --> 12:39.442
Well, it was tough going,
but it was lively.

12:40.313 --> 12:43.996
- What did you think of the open forum?
- This meeting of ugly people yelling...

12:44.121 --> 12:45.180
It is like torture.

12:45.422 --> 12:46.797
That's one perspective.

12:46.922 --> 12:50.282
In Boraqua, the government moves
like a hot knife through butter.

12:50.407 --> 12:52.446
I'm supposed to sit here
and listen to people,

12:52.571 --> 12:54.546
these fat faces turning all red.

12:54.671 --> 12:56.233
You kidding me?
We're like kings.

12:56.401 --> 12:59.569
We walk down the street,
and they treat us like rock stars.

13:00.519 --> 13:01.780
We answer to nobody.

13:01.975 --> 13:03.771
In a true democracy, we believe

13:03.896 --> 13:07.242
that the input of our citizens
is extremely valuable.

13:09.093 --> 13:10.810
These pretzels suck.

13:11.482 --> 13:13.291
Thank you.
See?

13:14.355 --> 13:16.231
No wonder nothing ever
gets done here.

13:16.356 --> 13:17.546
Nothing gets done?

13:17.741 --> 13:20.619
Tell that to the Golden Gate Bridge
or American Idol

13:20.744 --> 13:23.574
or the moon. Oh, wait.
You can't 'cause you've never been.

13:24.339 --> 13:26.345
Look, this is not personal.

13:26.779 --> 13:29.896
We just think that you are weak,
and your city is disgusting.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.406
I think you're rude.
And you've been rude since you came.

13:33.531 --> 13:35.814
And I think that
your medals are stupid.

13:36.381 --> 13:38.964
And your uniform is lame.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.319
And you guys want to marry
Hugo Chavez.

13:43.451 --> 13:44.823
Do not disrespect Chavez.

13:45.267 --> 13:46.700
Stupid Chavez.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.715
- I told you not to disrespect him.
- I did.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.455
- That's twice.
- I don't like Chavez.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.874
- You do, and do not disrespect him.
- No, I don't.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.001
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't, Raul.

13:56.339 --> 13:58.779
Look, if you don't
like it here, then go.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.673
- Great.
- Good, shut up.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.341
We're shutting up, yeah.

14:03.638 --> 14:04.783
Here we go.

14:06.641 --> 14:08.753
- Those are our pens.
- Great. We don't even need them.

14:08.878 --> 14:11.857
- Great. Then don't take them.
- We didn't.

14:15.977 --> 14:17.346
They started it.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.910
Those guys were rude, arrogant,

14:21.035 --> 14:23.028
narrow-minded, class-a jerks.

14:23.239 --> 14:25.736
Now, I may have lost my cool,
but they deserved it.

14:25.861 --> 14:28.533
Okay, I'll call the mayor
and cancel the photo-op.

14:28.702 --> 14:29.702
No, don't.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.454
Then call the Venezuelans
and apologize.

14:32.623 --> 14:35.957
No, they were rude, arrogant,
narrow-minded, class-a jerks.

14:36.504 --> 14:39.002
Okay, then I'll call the mayor
and cancel the photo-op.

14:41.443 --> 14:44.633
- Do you see the problem here?
- Yes, but I don't want to.

14:45.468 --> 14:49.050
Yesterday I was tough and direct.
And today I have to be charming.

14:49.274 --> 14:52.682
Basically, yesterday
I was Hillary Clinton, today I'm Bill.

14:52.850 --> 14:53.850
Gracias.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.416
Can I get anyone anything to drink
before we start...

14:56.541 --> 14:58.646
- Coffee, brandy?
- I'd love some coffee.

14:59.065 --> 14:59.987
Anything?

15:00.112 --> 15:01.942
- Some nuts?
- I'll have Some nuts.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.368
- Gummi bears.
- Sure.

15:03.493 --> 15:04.624
Apple crisps.

15:04.749 --> 15:06.279
- Granola bars.
- I'll take those.

15:06.527 --> 15:08.156
Nothing?
Sure?

15:08.809 --> 15:10.659
OK, I'll be right there
if you need me.

15:11.569 --> 15:14.224
Well, Raul, gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

15:14.790 --> 15:18.417
I would just like to first say
I am so sorry for blowing up yesterday.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.460
It was completely uncalled for.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.030
We are sorry as well.

15:23.311 --> 15:25.297
We were very tired
from our long journey.

15:25.422 --> 15:26.883
Also, we were a bit jealous.

15:27.181 --> 15:30.876
Our colleagues from Caracas are
visiting their sister city of Miami.

15:31.752 --> 15:33.754
They've been partying
with Dwayne Wade.

15:33.879 --> 15:36.682
They sent us all these photos
and Quicktime files,

15:36.807 --> 15:39.229
I mean, you have to see
this place Miami, just gorgeous.

15:39.398 --> 15:41.287
There's so much soul and life.

15:41.412 --> 15:42.997
Every little, tiny street.

15:43.122 --> 15:45.360
So much culture and history,
and the cars...

15:45.528 --> 15:47.130
People take care
of their cars there.

15:47.255 --> 15:50.695
I noticed that in the pictures.
They're a little older but beautiful.

15:50.820 --> 15:52.617
It's really nice, and the food...

15:53.061 --> 15:54.744
So spicy and wonderful.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.632
We could not even believe.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.157
But Pawnee is really good as well.

16:00.748 --> 16:03.574
In any case,
I made a few phone calls,

16:03.699 --> 16:06.389
and the government of Venezuela

16:06.783 --> 16:08.083
has authorized

16:08.912 --> 16:09.865
a special gift

16:10.980 --> 16:11.779
for you.

16:17.982 --> 16:19.311
$35,000?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.080
Yes, it is to fill your pit,

16:21.205 --> 16:23.023
to start to build a park.

16:24.412 --> 16:25.944
We can't take this.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.367
Yes, yes, please.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.030
We'll see you later today
at the photo opportunity.

16:30.626 --> 16:32.576
And I think we are good here.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.153
Good meeting.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.919
Maybe I should return the money.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.774
It's from a foreign government.
I don't really trust them.

16:47.899 --> 16:49.946
- I'm gonna return the money.
- Are you crazy?

16:50.071 --> 16:53.480
- You could buy a low-end Lexus.
- Or you could build a park.

16:53.605 --> 16:55.166
Let's look at the pros and cons.

16:55.473 --> 16:59.331
- Pro, we could fill in the pit.
- Con, maybe it's dirty money.

16:59.456 --> 17:01.645
Pro, $35,000 worth of dirty money.

17:01.813 --> 17:05.065
- Con, not quite sure why that's a pro.
- Pro, we can fill in the pit.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.084
Con, Ann already said that.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.202
Pro and con never works.

17:09.569 --> 17:10.819
Pro, yes, it does.

17:12.611 --> 17:13.560
I don't...

17:16.979 --> 17:19.070
Fine, we'll keep the money, OK?
Everybody happy?

17:19.195 --> 17:20.897
- Jerry, are you happy?
- What did I do?

17:21.082 --> 17:22.457
Meeting adjourned.

17:57.184 --> 18:00.036
Can I just say, I still feel
kind of weird about this money.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.324
I know they've given you
a hard time.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.354
When the mayor gets here,
we'll do the photo-op,

18:04.479 --> 18:07.377
they'll be out of our hair.
You'll get to build your park.

18:11.659 --> 18:13.618
The mayor will be with us
in a few minutes.

18:13.962 --> 18:17.176
We would like to take a video of you
to show our superiors.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.189
Sure.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.914
Do you have the check?

18:20.141 --> 18:21.129
Yes, I do.

18:22.359 --> 18:24.171
OK, you can show it to the camera,

18:24.650 --> 18:27.300
and say how much it is
and what it is for.

18:28.678 --> 18:31.495
Okay, this is a check for $35,000,

18:31.620 --> 18:34.195
- and it is to build a park.
- How generous.

18:35.254 --> 18:36.892
Yes, it's really generous.

18:37.341 --> 18:39.141
Now say, "viva Venezuela".

18:39.824 --> 18:41.063
Viva Venezuela.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.345
Viva Chavez.

18:44.197 --> 18:45.615
Thank you, Venezuela.

18:45.859 --> 18:48.103
- Viva Chavez... Say it.
- Ah, come on.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.510
I don't want to viva that guy.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.576
We just gave you $35,000.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.301
That's worth one viva.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.024
Viva Chavez.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.183
Yes, viva Chavez.

19:12.967 --> 19:14.367
What is he saying?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.063
They are very happy.

19:19.796 --> 19:22.913
They say Hugo Chavez
will love this video,

19:23.038 --> 19:26.233
because it is another success
for their committee.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.415
Committee?

19:29.210 --> 19:32.310
They're a committee
to humiliate and shame America.

19:33.597 --> 19:34.839
Gonna be a good video.

19:35.561 --> 19:38.438
The committee to humiliate
and shame America?

19:39.002 --> 19:41.602
Yes, it is Hugo Chavez's
passion project.

19:42.255 --> 19:43.644
We just had an idea.

19:43.769 --> 19:45.711
Why don't you call your park
after Chavez?

19:46.040 --> 19:47.852
You call it, "Hugo Chavez park".

19:48.795 --> 19:51.208
You can have
a nice big fountain of his head

19:51.333 --> 19:54.359
so that when the water is coming out,
he's spitting at you all the time.

19:56.358 --> 19:57.889
You should write this down.

20:01.445 --> 20:02.595
Viva America.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.785
Viva Pawnee.

20:04.234 --> 20:06.854
Viva mayor Walter Gunderson.

20:07.455 --> 20:08.734
You have offended us.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.375
You have offended
the government of Boraqua.

20:11.892 --> 20:13.479
You are no longer our sister.

20:17.145 --> 20:19.676
No, America is not perfect.

20:20.404 --> 20:22.713
But diplomacy isn't just

20:22.838 --> 20:24.734
sucking up and being a pushover.

20:25.101 --> 20:26.950
Sometimes you got to get tough.

20:27.733 --> 20:30.133
I am going to build
that park myself,

20:30.715 --> 20:32.355
and it is going to be awesome.

20:33.015 --> 20:36.533
And it's not going to have a fountain
shaped like Hugo Chavez's head

20:36.658 --> 20:38.681
spitting water all over everyone,

20:39.223 --> 20:41.025
unless that's what the people want.

20:42.209 --> 20:44.109
And that, sir, is democracy.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.137
Leslie, come see this.

20:49.433 --> 20:51.458
Check out this video
that April sent me.

20:51.714 --> 20:54.916
<i>Hey, guys, I'm at Jhonny's place
in Venezuela.</i>

20:55.041 --> 20:56.386
<i>It's okay, I guess.</i>

20:56.511 --> 20:58.511
<i>He has, like, 5 million rooms.</i>

20:58.940 --> 21:01.323
- <i>And this is only his guest house.</i>
- Holy cow.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.527
<i>There's a lot of guys
with guns here.</i>

21:03.968 --> 21:06.025
<i>It's better than
my mom's house, I guess.</i>

21:06.682 --> 21:09.559
<i>So tell Leslie I don't know
when I'm going to be back.</i>

21:09.849 --> 21:11.410
<i>And Donna's here.</i>

21:13.963 --> 21:14.897
<i>Hey, guys.</i>
