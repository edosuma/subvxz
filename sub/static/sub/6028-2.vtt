00:03.960 --> 00:07.079
The Kazakh government has
announced that it's to continue with plans...

00:07.160 --> 00:12.079
... to compulsory-purchase several million
acres of arable land in Kazakhstan...

00:12.160 --> 00:15.119
... much of it owned by China
and the United States.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.119
The US has strongly condemned
the move...

00:17.200 --> 00:20.479
... likening it to Soviet-era
renationalisation.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.799
The Kazakh president has said that,
with the continuing weak prices...

00:23.880 --> 00:26.479
... his nation is struggling
to feed its people...

00:26.560 --> 00:28.079
Glasses.

00:32.920 --> 00:35.159
Notepad.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.039
No pages missing.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.319
Pen.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.639
If you're in there,
she stays shackled, you understand?

01:29.720 --> 01:31.199
I'm Ross.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.999
Your new interrogator.

01:37.720 --> 01:42.919
I know my predecessor wasn't gentle.
I know he hurt you, Jess.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.879
And, in return,
you hurt him.

01:44.960 --> 01:48.999
Hurt him? She stuck a fucking
screwdriver into his spine.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.719
I'm not going to be
like that.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.399
- Don't.
- Okay.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.399
Don't go too close.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.679
I want to see
what he did to you.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.839
Can you get me a book,
please?

02:23.840 --> 02:26.879
- What book would you like?
- The Bible.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.439
I want to read the Bible.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.279
You have this.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.759
I sold it.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.319
It's a graphic novel.

02:40.400 --> 02:43.039
It's about a scientist who makes a deal
with the devil.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.959
The manuscript exists.
The boy knows where it is.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.079
Do you want to see
my nuclear fallout shelter?

02:48.160 --> 02:49.759
Where is Jessica Hyde?

02:51.320 --> 02:54.399
Yesterday I was arrested for a sex crime,
today I'm on the run...

02:54.480 --> 02:56.639
... from ex-government nutters
who want to put out my eyes.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.559
I'm a fucking IT consultant.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.719
I'm Jessica Hyde.
I'm Philip Carvel's daughter.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.359
Don't find out the truth
about our father.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.239
We need to find out
why they want the manuscript.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.479
It has the identity
of Mr. Rabbit.

03:10.560 --> 03:15.159
We believe it describes the molecular
structure of a protein we call Janus.

03:15.240 --> 03:19.959
The purpose of Janus
is to sterilise the entire human race.

03:20.040 --> 03:23.039
I destroyed your work.
Janus is gone!

03:23.120 --> 03:26.999
That's just a bunch of
old drawings done by a crazy man.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.999
That's where he hid Janus.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.679
It's in me!

04:33.320 --> 04:35.199
Is your mother home?

04:50.720 --> 04:52.559
Thanks, Peter.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.719
- It's Pietre.
- Peter, that's what I said.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.719
Come on. Cartoons.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.279
I like cartoons.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.519
- I see you two have settled in, then.
- Look what Peter got me.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.919
- You've got to stop buying her things.
- No, he doesn't.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.519
- You don't, Peter.
- It's Pietre.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.239
- Peter, that's what I said.
- Don't tease him, Amanda.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.639
- Pietre.
- Peter.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.719
- It's Pietre.
- Peter.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.719
You all right, Ian?

06:00.400 --> 06:01.919
Everything...

06:02.440 --> 06:04.079
Everything all right?

06:04.160 --> 06:05.879
Why are you asking that?

06:05.960 --> 06:07.959
No, no reason.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.159
- I'm not prodding.
- Prodding?

06:10.240 --> 06:11.919
You're not prodding?

06:14.760 --> 06:17.039
Actually, there was something.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.759
Do you think it's possible
to actually die of boredom?

06:20.840 --> 06:23.439
Cos I was just going to staple
my own tongue.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.999
That's how bored I am.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.319
I was going to staple
my own fucking tongue...

06:27.400 --> 06:32.919
... in the hope that pain will give me some
small reprieve from the tedium... of IT.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.399
Do you want
to talk about it, buddy?

06:40.480 --> 06:41.879
No. No...

06:41.960 --> 06:45.479
- Because self-harm is a key indicator...
- It's not self-harm, Joe, okay?

06:45.560 --> 06:48.479
Doing this job is self-harm.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.679
You're not alone, Ian.

06:56.320 --> 06:59.919
My cousin...
he tried to kill himself.

07:00.680 --> 07:04.759
He was just like you.
He just... disappeared.

07:04.840 --> 07:08.039
And then we found out
he'd been in hospital and he'd tried to...

07:10.280 --> 07:11.919
I mean...

07:14.360 --> 07:17.199
Once or twice,
I've found myself...

07:18.200 --> 07:19.599
You know.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.159
- Thinking about...
- I'm going to do some work now, Joe.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.479
Yeah, yeah, course.

07:25.560 --> 07:29.439
Cos I really feel like I need to,
you know, get fucking cracking.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.999
Yeah.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.359
Yeah, you, er...

07:40.480 --> 07:41.999
Yeah.

07:51.160 --> 07:54.279
Yeah... welcome back.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.799
Again.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.879
Becky.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.879
Where are you, Becky?

08:16.880 --> 08:19.879
I have this... Jess.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.319
But I'd like to think
I don't need it.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.559
Why are you
calling me Jess?

08:24.640 --> 08:26.879
That's what Christos
called you.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.199
- So you're trying to get into my head?
- No.

08:30.280 --> 08:34.839
Just trying to connect, that's all.
And I know how alone you must feel.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.559
Your father
put Janus in you...

08:37.640 --> 08:42.199
... but before he did...
he made an adjustment to it.

08:42.280 --> 08:46.239
Now, we've taken Janus from your blood.
It works perfectly.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.359
We're making it right now.

08:48.440 --> 08:53.119
Hiding it in the Russian flu vaccine
that everyone is so desperate for.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.719
But we cannot see
his adjustment.

08:56.800 --> 09:02.159
And we can't release the vaccine
until we know what the adjustment is.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.159
We know he told Christos.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.319
And we think...

09:09.160 --> 09:11.399
... Christos told you.

09:11.480 --> 09:16.079
So... I would like you...
to tell me.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.039
Because there is
another way, Jess.

09:21.120 --> 09:26.439
And our scientists say that,
if they can cut open your brain...

09:26.520 --> 09:28.359
... they'll find it.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.919
I'm holding them off, Jess.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.399
Why?

09:34.320 --> 09:38.359
- Why not just cut me open?
- I don't want you hurt.

09:38.440 --> 09:42.439
- You are your father's daughter.
- My father's daughter?

09:43.680 --> 09:45.959
He put this thing in me.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.159
I was nothing but
a genetic container to him.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.959
No. You're wrong.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.559
He loved you.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.159
Hello, matey.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.079
It's all right. I'm alone.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.279
I thought you was dead.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.799
Nearly.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.759
Lost the use of my arm.
Nerve damage.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.679
My lung's all messed up.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.559
I'm not much use
to anyone now.

10:41.640 --> 10:46.519
- How did you find me?
- Well... it wasn't easy.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.999
You're being discreet.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.639
What's in that bag?

10:54.720 --> 10:56.439
Clothes.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.719
Bits of food.
I move around a lot.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.039
Are you hungry?

11:12.680 --> 11:14.399
What is this?

11:14.480 --> 11:16.439
Quinoa.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.959
It's a super-food.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.479
Yeah.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.079
Super.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.999
- Still got our old bag, then?
- It's good for tools.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.559
I'm a plumber.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.159
Nice. Nice work.

11:31.960 --> 11:35.719
Sort of thing that appeals
to a meticulous mind.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.399
- How long's all this been going on?
- Four months.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.599
We met in a pub.
They like me.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.119
- I'm quiet.
- Yeah!

11:45.760 --> 11:47.999
You certainly are quiet.

11:51.360 --> 11:54.399
Have you struggled
to adjust, Arby?

11:56.160 --> 11:57.799
I have.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.839
I know it's odd, but...

12:02.680 --> 12:05.319
... I brush my teeth
obsessively.

12:06.080 --> 12:09.119
Like the things we did
are caught in me...

12:09.720 --> 12:11.719
... in my mouth or...

12:13.560 --> 12:15.319
What about you?

12:16.320 --> 12:19.759
No, I just brush
the normal amount.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.439
I think
we can move on, Lee.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.679
- I mean, it's all over now.
- Over?

12:30.760 --> 12:33.199
What, that fire?

12:33.280 --> 12:34.879
Come on.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.799
You think a thing
like that stops them?

12:37.880 --> 12:39.439
They're starting again.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.559
Nothing's over.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.279
And I know things.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.759
Example:
I know they want you...

12:47.400 --> 12:49.399
... for a job.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.039
There's someone
they want got rid of.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.119
They want you to do it.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.639
But...

12:57.320 --> 12:59.679
... I'm out, Lee.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.239
Just like you.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.159
Out?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.639
I'm not out.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.199
Who said I was out?

13:11.800 --> 13:14.159
You're never out, Arby.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.079
Not a good idea.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.799
I swear it isn't.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.439
Hello, you.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.079
Oh. Hello.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.799
I'm Lee.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.719
I'm an old friend of Arby's
from the old days.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.799
- Arby's told me all about you.
- Arby?

13:31.880 --> 13:35.039
A nickname.
We used to work together.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.559
Has he not told you anything
about our work together?

13:37.640 --> 13:40.399
Tell me about it? Mr. Mystery?
You've got to be kidding.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.119
- He does love a mystery.
- What's in that bag?

13:43.200 --> 13:46.199
- Amanda, don't be rude.
- Oh, that's not rude.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.479
Curiosity should always
be encouraged.

13:49.560 --> 13:54.759
I tell you what, Amanda,
why don't you open it up and have a look?

14:06.040 --> 14:07.839
What on earth is that?

14:07.920 --> 14:09.719
Dental gas.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.839
It's a prototype.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.039
I work for a company
that sells to dentists.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.519
Pop it on the table, love.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.959
What do you do with it?

14:22.040 --> 14:27.719
Well... when little kids don't look
after their teeth and they get rotten...

14:27.800 --> 14:30.319
... we have
to make them sleep.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.999
Let's hope we never have
to use it on you, eh?

14:34.080 --> 14:37.559
- Do you want tea or anything?
- Not for me, Tess. I won't be long.

14:37.640 --> 14:40.719
I intend
finishing here very soon.

14:43.480 --> 14:47.759
Oh, I just remembered
where my electronic fag was.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.279
You see, all this...

15:06.520 --> 15:08.039
It's not for you.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.999
You know that.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.039
It's been a lovely holiday
and you'll never forget it...

15:15.120 --> 15:17.519
... or the people
you met here.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.479
But it's time
to come home now, Arby.

15:22.920 --> 15:26.599
And you can never, ever...
come back.

15:32.760 --> 15:37.399
As you all now know, Corvadt has today
gone into administration.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.599
But, as sole manufacturer
of the Russian flu vaccine...

15:41.680 --> 15:46.479
... we believe that Corvadt
cannot be allowed to fail.

15:46.560 --> 15:52.279
So, I have taken the decision
that Corvadt will be bailed out.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.519
As of today,
we are making the vaccine.

15:54.600 --> 15:58.399
And this will happen
at an unprecedented pace.

15:58.480 --> 16:02.879
So, if Russian flu strikes,
you will be protected.

16:03.560 --> 16:08.999
It is with this in mind I am very pleased
to introduce the new temporary CEO...

16:09.080 --> 16:11.599
... a man
with years of experience...

16:11.680 --> 16:15.719
... and someone who is intimately familiar
with Russian flu:

16:15.800 --> 16:18.039
Mr. Michael Dugdale.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.079
There we go.
Not so bad, was it?

16:37.160 --> 16:39.799
Apart from you
looking like a tit.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.359
How about you?

16:43.040 --> 16:46.439
How are you doing?
You're with us now.

16:47.760 --> 16:51.159
We are not
fucking friends, Geoff.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.439
Okay? I don't like you.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.479
I'd go so far as to say
I hate you.

16:57.320 --> 17:01.519
I despise you. Every time I see you,
I feel physically sick.

17:01.600 --> 17:06.519
I'm seeing this vaccine through,
but that's it, right?

17:06.600 --> 17:08.839
You... you remember that.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.239
Go home.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.799
You're the last one here.
Thought you hated this place...

18:29.520 --> 18:32.119
Joe, do you wanna go
for a drink?

18:37.160 --> 18:39.279
Pints for the lads.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.719
Hey, did you hear about Martin?
He's going out with Leanne.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.039
What? Leanne?

18:48.280 --> 18:51.719
Do you ever think your life
has become meaningless, Joe?

18:54.240 --> 18:57.919
What if I were to tell you
that I didn't try and kill myself at all?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.999
That there was no hospital?

19:00.080 --> 19:02.239
What if I were to tell you
that I'd been on the run...

19:02.320 --> 19:06.679
... chased by a shadowy organisation
that wanted to kill me, my friends...

19:06.760 --> 19:11.759
... and control governments and whose
objective was to sterilise the world?

19:11.840 --> 19:13.759
And I stopped them.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.639
Me.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.039
I reckon
she's just leading him on.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.639
Leanne?
She's not his type.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.999
Google alert? Grant Leetham?
Who's Grant Leetham?

19:40.560 --> 19:41.999
I can hear that down the street.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.079
Yeah? I'm being a fucking Goth.
That's what you want, innit?

19:44.160 --> 19:47.039
- That's not even Goth music!
- It's shit. It'll do.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.919
And why are you talking
on chatrooms?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.079
- Grant, you're supposed to be dead!
- No-one will believe them nut jobs.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.119
For fuck's sake, Grant,
you can't do this!

19:53.200 --> 19:57.759
I'm dead. I'm dead, mate!
My mum, my mates, everyone I know...

19:57.840 --> 20:00.679
... they all think I fucking killed myself
cos of you and that bitch Milner!

20:00.760 --> 20:02.319
Milner is finishing off The Network.
When that's done...

20:02.400 --> 20:04.759
Milner. Milner. Fucking Milner.

20:05.560 --> 20:07.719
We ain't heard from her
in months.

20:07.800 --> 20:11.839
She's forgotten about us, Ian.
We've been left here to rot.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.439
I'm fucking sick to my tits of you.
I'm going out!

20:15.520 --> 20:17.159
- No, you're not.
- I am.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.159
- Grant...
- Ian... Get off me!

20:19.240 --> 20:21.799
- For fuck's sake!
- Ian...

20:27.840 --> 20:30.199
Grant... I'm... I'm sorry.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.519
- I'm sorry. Are you all right?
- You punched me.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.359
- I know, I'm sorry.
- I'm a kid.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.199
- I... I know. I'm fucking sorry. Grant!
- I'm not a child.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.319
I'm calling the police...

20:38.400 --> 20:42.839
... and telling them you touched my bollocks!
You paedo!

21:17.360 --> 21:19.519
I like the new patch.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.279
Have you thought about
what I said?

21:24.080 --> 21:25.479
Yeah.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.839
Why me? I mean...

21:28.920 --> 21:31.519
... you told me who you are.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.159
Who you really are.
Why did you take that risk?

21:34.240 --> 21:38.239
We tortured you, we disfigured you,
we murdered your father..

21:38.320 --> 21:39.999
... and yet
in the last instance...

21:40.080 --> 21:43.959
... you chose to betray the people
you'd grown to love for our cause.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.759
Yeah, but am I...

21:47.160 --> 21:48.719
Am I capable?

21:48.800 --> 21:50.839
Of course you are.
You believe in...

21:50.920 --> 21:54.119
I'm not talking about belief,
I'm talking about... capacity.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.799
Look, I... I want to help you,
and I believe this is right...

21:57.880 --> 22:01.079
... it's just...
I don't think I can.

22:04.760 --> 22:07.639
What do you see
when you see me?

22:07.720 --> 22:09.159
Milner.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.759
Letan, Mr. Rabbit, I dunno.

22:12.840 --> 22:16.199
What do you see
when you see me?

22:18.120 --> 22:19.879
I see...

22:24.360 --> 22:26.279
I see someone...

22:26.880 --> 22:29.799
... who's killed thousands...

22:32.560 --> 22:36.359
... who... murders...
tortures...

22:36.440 --> 22:40.759
... executes innocent children
without hesitation.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.639
- That's what I see.
- And do you think I wanted that?

22:46.720 --> 22:49.759
Do you think
I wanted to be Mr. Rabbit?

22:51.160 --> 22:54.439
You're capable of more than you know,
Wilson, believe me.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.799
Do you recognise me?

23:24.800 --> 23:26.559
I can see him in you.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.039
You knew my father?

23:29.120 --> 23:31.079
I knew him very well.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.559
I made sure
you survived his leaving.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.879
I have a very important thing
for you to do.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.399
This man knows something.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.319
His name is Christian Donaldson.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.439
And what he knows,
no-one can know.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.839
I'm trusting you,
do you see?

23:47.920 --> 23:49.959
I want you back.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.759
If only you could've known
your father, Arby.

23:53.840 --> 23:58.199
- He was incredible, he was...
- My name's Pietre.

23:59.960 --> 24:03.279
And my father
wasn't incredible.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.159
Not at all.

24:16.280 --> 24:19.599
You're being
uncharacteristically soft.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.919
He'll do it.
He'll come back to us.

24:23.920 --> 24:27.199
But, just in case, send others, too.
Send a SWAT team.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.599
Make sure Donaldson's dead.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.759
I wish Becky
had taken me with her.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.119
I hate you.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.279
She was great, Becky.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.439
Yeah.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.919
She was great, Becky.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.439
Becky!

25:19.080 --> 25:22.199
It's a long way down, Becky.
I don't think you should jump.

25:22.280 --> 25:26.519
Jesus Christ, just let me die in peace,
you creepy little fuck!

25:26.600 --> 25:31.199
This isn't why I contacted you.
I wanted your help, not your death.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.319
- You don't have to do this yet.
- And what do I get for my help?

25:35.400 --> 25:37.599
Another month of life?

25:38.400 --> 25:41.119
Six weeks
if you're generous?

25:41.760 --> 25:45.959
Just fuck off, Christian,
I'm not doing this any more!

25:46.040 --> 25:47.719
One year.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.599
A whole year.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.999
A year's worth of Thoraxin,
Becky.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.319
It works, doesn't it?

25:59.400 --> 26:02.839
I mean, it's not a cure,
but it's taking care of the symptoms.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.559
And what do I have
to do for it?

26:05.640 --> 26:08.239
Nothing like last time,
I promise.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.799
I'm not asking you to get the manuscript,
I'm not asking you to betray your friends.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.719
Just help me now
downstairs...

26:16.000 --> 26:17.519
... Becky.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.479
Hi.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.119
Who's this to?

26:24.600 --> 26:26.359
Oh, piss the fuck off!

26:26.440 --> 26:29.759
This is a honeytrap,
show a bit of fucking honey!

26:29.840 --> 26:32.119
God...
Who is this guy again?

26:32.200 --> 26:35.759
Tony Bradley.
An utterly mediocre scientist.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.919
I went to college with him.
He's a moron.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.999
And out of nowhere he's written
the definitive book on Deel's syndrome.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.919
I've read it. It's brilliant.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.519
- So...?
- So he's an idiot.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.959
The knowledge in that book,
he's stolen it!

26:51.040 --> 26:52.999
Look, Becky, I'm clever.

26:53.080 --> 26:56.119
Think how much more use
that would be in my hands.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.359
And this is out the kindness
of your heart...

26:59.440 --> 27:01.879
... to help Deel's victims?

27:02.840 --> 27:04.399
No. I want to take
what he's got...

27:04.480 --> 27:06.519
... write my own book
and make a shitload of cash.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.679
And if I don't help you?

27:08.760 --> 27:14.959
Well, the NHS does some wonderful things
around end-of-life planning.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.799
Right...

27:25.040 --> 27:26.599
Excuse me.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.279
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.839
Becky.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.919
God, you're so funny!

27:36.000 --> 27:37.719
- Am I?
- Yeah.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.239
Didn't think I was!

27:45.440 --> 27:49.159
- Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
- Shut up.

27:49.240 --> 27:52.359
- I've got this.
- Fuck! Where did you get that?

27:52.440 --> 27:56.599
- Christian, is that you?
- What have you got a gun for?

27:57.840 --> 28:00.319
- It's for shooting people.
- Are you two together?

28:00.400 --> 28:01.919
Oh, fuck, no.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.479
- Not like that, we're not.
- Where are you getting this?

28:06.560 --> 28:09.399
I've read your fucking book.
You don't know any of this.

28:09.480 --> 28:13.039
- I am a respected scientist.
- No, you're not.

28:13.120 --> 28:16.239
Yes, well, you're hardly a Nobel
prize-winner, are you, Christian?

28:16.320 --> 28:20.199
That's because I've got demons.
You're just a knuckle-dragger.

28:20.280 --> 28:24.559
No! I have painstakingly and methodically
researched Deel's syndrome...

28:24.640 --> 28:27.479
... and I have made...
certain leaps.

28:27.560 --> 28:30.559
And I did it on my own,
just me.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.679
Get up.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.959
Me sim bokhalo.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.079
Xabe?

28:59.160 --> 29:02.799
Jesus! It's like a dungeon.

29:04.760 --> 29:07.639
- Are you having sex with this man?
- No!

29:10.600 --> 29:11.799
All right, look.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.519
I was in the middle of a class about
five months ago...

29:15.600 --> 29:17.839
... and he just walked in.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.719
He started doing equations
on the board.

29:20.800 --> 29:24.079
I had no idea
what was going on.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.439
But the stuff was incredible.

29:26.520 --> 29:30.559
So I brought him home,
gave him some food.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.039
He kept doing it.

29:33.120 --> 29:36.279
I realised it related to Deel's.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.639
And I thought, well,
it should be published.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.919
How would he know
about Deel's?

29:45.920 --> 29:48.079
What language is that?

29:48.160 --> 29:51.079
I... I have no idea.

29:51.160 --> 29:54.759
He doesn't speak English.
I think his name is Anton.

29:54.840 --> 29:55.999
Da?

29:56.080 --> 29:59.479
Let's get out of here.
This doesn't feel safe.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.319
Right, well...

30:01.400 --> 30:03.959
Anton, come on.

30:04.040 --> 30:06.119
Let's get you out.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.599
Hold his hand.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.079
I'm going to tie your hands together.
It's inconspicuous...

30:11.160 --> 30:14.679
... and it's hard to run
when you're tied to another human being.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.199
No! You fucking do it.

30:17.280 --> 30:23.319
- Can I go? Can I just go now, please?
- Becky, will you stop messing around?

30:25.720 --> 30:28.479
Right, well,
you'll have to have the gun.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.839
You are such a twat.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.199
Can I just go now, please?

30:35.040 --> 30:38.079
We need information first,
then you can go.

30:43.680 --> 30:45.919
When I first came here...

30:46.000 --> 30:51.359
... they used to let me go up
to another room for an hour every day.

30:51.440 --> 30:55.159
There was a window there,
I could see clouds outside.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.959
They took it away because...

31:03.640 --> 31:05.719
... I hurt people.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.999
Do you like clouds?

31:13.800 --> 31:17.879
I believe in what your father did.
I believe in Janus.

31:17.960 --> 31:24.199
But am I going to sit here and tell you
that what he did to you... was right?

31:24.800 --> 31:26.359
No.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.319
No, I'm not.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.839
Did you want children,
Jessica?

31:42.080 --> 31:46.799
He denies you a father
and then he denies you children.

31:49.400 --> 31:53.839
- What kind of mother would I have been?
- You'd have been a great mother.

31:56.360 --> 32:00.439
- I couldn't have been a mother.
- All that love?

32:01.040 --> 32:03.279
You'd have been amazing.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.879
We're running out of time,
Jess.

32:10.960 --> 32:14.919
- Are you ready to tell me?
- Why don't you just hurt me?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.079
That's not what you deserve.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.719
It just... isn't.

32:29.440 --> 32:32.039
... of a worldwide
vaccination programme.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.719
These diseases are everywhere
on the increase...

32:34.800 --> 32:40.879
... and it's now possible that TB deaths
may overtake malaria deaths within five years.

32:42.640 --> 32:46.279
Er... y-yes.
Yes, that's... that's, um...

32:47.360 --> 32:48.439
... bad.

32:48.520 --> 32:52.159
It's all about transport
with the vaccines.

32:52.240 --> 32:55.159
The cold chain
must remain uninterrupted...

32:55.240 --> 32:59.439
... and this means
refrigerated trucks, ships...

32:59.520 --> 33:01.919
These places are remote,
it's... it's hard.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.639
Yes. Well, well done.
You've been doing some excellent...

33:04.720 --> 33:07.359
Ah, Mr. Gorsand,
how good to see you.

33:07.440 --> 33:10.759
Geoff isn't here because
he cares about vaccines, darling.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.999
He's here because he wants my fucking
papers on board for the next election.

33:14.080 --> 33:17.879
- Ha, we're not like that these days.
- Politics doesn't change.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.319
There's a room nearby
we can use.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.639
Why don't you join us?

33:30.600 --> 33:33.599
- You can wait in there.
- Look, I think it's about time I...

33:33.680 --> 33:35.759
Do as you're told, dear.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.839
Every time a new drug is developed,
there are winners and losers.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.639
If you're watching this, you're a winner,
but not everyone is so lucky.

33:45.720 --> 33:49.839
On average, vaccines reach the Third World
15 years after we get them.

33:49.920 --> 33:53.999
That's 15 years of disease,
of misery, of death.

33:54.080 --> 33:57.279
Russian flu has the potential
to kill millions.

33:57.360 --> 34:01.119
But there is a vaccine.
As usual, we'll get it first...

34:01.200 --> 34:05.119
... the developing world left to beg,
left to die.

34:05.200 --> 34:08.599
But we want to say,
"No, not this time."

34:08.680 --> 34:12.319
V Day is an initiative started by
the Rochane Foundation...

34:12.400 --> 34:16.359
... to get the Russian flu vaccine
to everyone at the same time.

34:16.440 --> 34:19.199
16th November. V Day.

34:19.280 --> 34:21.799
It means us waiting
a few months for the vaccine...

34:21.880 --> 34:24.839
... so that they
don't have to wait decades.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.119
Isn't that worth it?

34:26.200 --> 34:29.479
- Support V Day.
- Say, "No, not this time."

34:29.560 --> 34:32.479
This time, we live together.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.759
Are you fucking serious?
This?

34:39.840 --> 34:42.639
We launch V Day
on Wednesday.

34:42.720 --> 34:44.959
Leah's Rochane Foundation
will back the campaign...

34:45.040 --> 34:47.879
... underwriting the cost for countries
that can't afford it.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.879
- And how much will that be?
- $268 billion.

34:53.160 --> 34:57.239
But that's six times the deficit.
You can't afford that!

34:57.320 --> 34:59.559
No NGO has anywhere near
that kind of money.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.599
We have 23 billion.

35:01.680 --> 35:06.439
My husband is worth 11
and he's leaving it all to us.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.079
He will die next week.

35:08.160 --> 35:13.079
His example will be followed.
Alexander Levchenko, 23 billion...

35:13.160 --> 35:17.519
... Steph Aberg, 21 billion,
Tim Stanton, 18 billion.

35:17.600 --> 35:22.159
- There are others.
- We're harvesting the rich, Geoff.

35:22.240 --> 35:26.959
We have celebrities
and NGOs ready to back us.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.799
It's a good thing.

35:28.880 --> 35:32.879
But you're the most important.
You run the health department...

35:32.960 --> 35:35.639
... and the department
now owns Corvadt.

35:35.720 --> 35:40.399
If you say no-one gets the vaccine
until we all do... so be it.

35:42.440 --> 35:46.719
I can't do that.
That's political suicide.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.959
My career will be over.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.679
How do you think
you got your career?

35:53.760 --> 35:56.439
Through talent and ability?

35:56.520 --> 36:00.439
You've got your career
because we gave it to you.

36:00.520 --> 36:04.119
You only have one talent, Geoff,
and it's doing what you're told.

36:48.280 --> 36:49.919
Jess?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.759
Are you ready?

36:54.160 --> 36:57.159
I don't know
what the adjustment is, Ross.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.599
Christos never told me.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.399
What?

37:06.480 --> 37:07.839
No...

37:08.440 --> 37:09.679
That can't be.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.639
They tortured you
for five months.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.839
I pretended to know.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.079
I had to, to stay alive.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.359
I want to show you
what they did to me.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.359
I know you're scared.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.719
But you must trust me.

37:43.800 --> 37:47.319
We're running
out of time, Jess.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.319
But your approach...

37:53.280 --> 37:55.799
Your approach is different.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.359
You want to get in my head.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.799
No. No, I'm not in your head.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.679
I know you're not.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.039
I know you're not, Ross.

38:24.680 --> 38:27.079
I'm in yours.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.639
Oh, for fuck...

38:49.040 --> 38:50.959
Something's come up.
I'm off.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.239
Oh, er... Yeah.

38:53.320 --> 38:57.639
Cool, buddy.
Er... do you mind me asking wh...

39:06.440 --> 39:08.319
I've found her.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.399
Becky! I've found her.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.919
Come on, dickhead, let's go.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.319
Yes!

39:16.400 --> 39:17.839
Here.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.359
Can you understand me?

39:28.440 --> 39:31.119
What I'm saying?
Do you speak English?

39:31.200 --> 39:33.959
- Will you stop fucking struggling?
- Can I go now? Please!

39:34.040 --> 39:36.439
Of course you can't go!
I need to know what he knows about Deel's...

39:36.520 --> 39:40.639
... and you've screwed the knot up so tight
we've got to find a fucking knife.

39:48.640 --> 39:50.719
Why are you staying here?

39:50.800 --> 39:54.319
I'm hiding out.
I felt like I was being followed.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.799
Oh, shit.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.679
Becky, can you get a knife?

40:00.960 --> 40:04.159
Stop bloody sweating, Tony!

40:11.520 --> 40:13.199
There's fuck all here.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.359
Where was she going?

40:22.680 --> 40:25.759
There.
She was going that way.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.119
Let's be careful.

40:57.320 --> 40:59.759
Just wait here, Okay?

41:21.480 --> 41:23.599
Palpale...

41:24.280 --> 41:26.559
Ka murro trayo.

41:27.760 --> 41:30.039
Rrugiv tut...

43:26.240 --> 43:28.079
How many?

43:29.560 --> 43:31.279
I'll let you live.

43:31.360 --> 43:33.119
Four.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.919
- Including you?
- Yes.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.679
Thank you.

43:39.680 --> 43:42.439
Come with me
or they'll kill you.

44:18.840 --> 44:21.079
What the fuck
are you doing here?

44:22.160 --> 44:25.919
I... I've come to find you.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.359
Why?

44:29.440 --> 44:31.679
What do you mean, why?

44:31.760 --> 44:34.719
I mean, why have you come
to find me?

44:34.800 --> 44:37.439
- Why do you think?
- I don't know.

44:37.520 --> 44:40.279
That's why
I'm fucking asking you.

44:42.520 --> 44:46.199
Jesus, this is not at all going
how I imagined it would.

44:52.920 --> 44:54.519
Oh, my God!

45:02.280 --> 45:04.719
There's one more.
Wait here.

45:13.680 --> 45:15.839
What the hell is that?

45:15.920 --> 45:19.359
Can I go now?
Can I just go now, please? Please...

45:39.760 --> 45:42.679
Come on!
What are you doing?

45:45.760 --> 45:47.919
- Come on!
- Stop! Stop!

45:50.480 --> 45:53.319
Tony?
Are you having a heart attack?

45:54.160 --> 45:56.959
Are you having
a fucking heart attack?

45:58.680 --> 46:00.119
Oh, fuck!

46:37.600 --> 46:39.919
My name's Pietre.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.559
We need to run.
All of us. Right now.

47:08.080 --> 47:10.439
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck was that?

47:10.520 --> 47:12.199
- Who were they?
- I don't know.

47:12.280 --> 47:14.279
- Grant, are you all right?
- He's a psycho!

47:14.360 --> 47:17.399
He killed Bejan, Alice's mum!
He just fucking shot her!

47:17.480 --> 47:20.479
It's okay.
I'm not going to hurt you.

47:20.560 --> 47:21.719
I saved you.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.759
And those soldiers
weren't there to kill you, either.

47:24.840 --> 47:28.879
- Then, why were they there?
- They were there to kill him.

47:29.440 --> 47:30.999
Me?

47:31.520 --> 47:33.999
What the fuck have I done?

47:44.120 --> 47:47.759
She made the rope,
plaited it from pages torn from a Bible.

47:47.840 --> 47:50.839
Then she wound it into the gate's mechanism
but we don't know which way.

47:50.920 --> 47:54.639
Press up, down, it could release him
or it could tear his head off.

47:54.720 --> 47:57.519
We can't go in there because she's rigged
these doors onto the same circuit...

47:57.600 --> 47:59.079
... and we can't override it.

47:59.160 --> 48:03.999
If you interfere with the mechanism,
the gate shuts. It's a safety measure.

48:04.760 --> 48:08.319
Has she tried to get out?
Made any demands? What does she want?

48:08.400 --> 48:11.119
She doesn't want anything.
She's lost her mind.

48:11.200 --> 48:13.759
She's just...
not moved in five hours.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.239
Just stares at clouds.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.479
Who gave her the Bible?

48:57.200 --> 48:59.919
What have I done to you,
Jessica?

49:01.960 --> 49:03.999
What have I done?

49:08.640 --> 49:10.199
Glasses.

49:12.440 --> 49:14.239
Notepad.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.959
No pages missing.

49:19.200 --> 49:20.679
Pen.

49:31.360 --> 49:33.119
Sign out.

49:38.280 --> 49:40.759
You got a pen that works?
