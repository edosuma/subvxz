Sure, we dance our asses
off for two hours,

00:43.910 --> 00:45.811
and then five minutes
from the end they walk out,

00:45.845 --> 00:47.880
stand there, flash their boobs
and bring the house down.

00:47.914 --> 00:49.748
- I know.
- That's all they do, twice a show...

00:49.782 --> 00:51.717
- walk out and stand there.
- And they get paid more.

00:51.751 --> 00:54.753
And they get paid more. It's a great message
we're sending to the girls of America.

00:54.787 --> 00:56.788
"Hey, girls, forget about
actually learning to dance.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.057
- Just take your top off and stand there."
- "And you'll get paid more."

00:59.092 --> 01:01.627
It's not even about the face.
Half of 'em aren't even pretty.

01:01.661 --> 01:04.696
Mara over there looks like Muammar
Gaddafi, but no one cares.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.065
- She still gets paid more.
- So so wrong.

01:07.100 --> 01:10.736
<i>♪ whoa oh!</i>

01:12.939 --> 01:16.041
I'd take my top off if I could,
but I'm flat as a board.

01:16.075 --> 01:18.777
Maybe I should buy some.
I mean, how much could they be?

01:18.811 --> 01:20.112
- Five to seven grand.
- What? No!

01:20.146 --> 01:22.014
- Each.
- You pay per boob?

01:22.048 --> 01:24.116
If anything in the world should be
sold as a pair, it should be boobs.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.118
I heard that gaddafi
comment, by the way.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.987
I'm depressed. Where do you
wanna go to get drunk tonight?

01:29.022 --> 01:30.756
- I can't.
- Why? It's Tuesday.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.691
- We always get drunk on Tuesday.
- Tonight I am going

01:32.725 --> 01:33.859
straight home
and straight to bed.

01:33.893 --> 01:35.961
- I have to be in perfect
- Why? Tomorrow.

01:35.995 --> 01:37.796
- Because I got it.
- No!

01:37.830 --> 01:39.131
The audition for "Chicago"?

01:39.165 --> 01:41.066
- 10:00 sharp.
- I can't believe it.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.001
I'm finally going to get
to really dance again.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.737
- Fosse, jazz hands.
- God, I'm jealous. How?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.072
My buddy Jimmy Hewson's
the new dance captain.

01:47.106 --> 01:48.840
He arranged the whole thing.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.876
Hey, Michelle,
here for you again.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.011
What? Oh crap.
No, not tonight.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.780
<i>Oh, come on!</i>
<i>He's sweet and harmless.</i>

01:54.814 --> 01:57.683
Every time he comes to town he brings
you things and buys you dinner.

01:57.717 --> 01:59.051
He's odd and weird
and technically a stalker.

01:59.085 --> 02:01.019
- He's lonely.
- He wears *** socks with a suit.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.021
At least you have and admirer.
I've got nothing.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.957
- I buy my own dinner.
- Talia, go distract him,

02:04.991 --> 02:06.758
so that I can grab my stuff
and slip out the back.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.693
- That's mean.
- Well, I'm a mean girl.

02:08.728 --> 02:10.628
- The sooner he learns that, the better.
- He's been coming here

02:10.663 --> 02:12.764
once a month for over a year.
I think he's a slow learner.

02:12.799 --> 02:13.966
Talia, I have to
be perfect tomorrow...

02:14.000 --> 02:16.601
perfect and glowing
and 25 by 10:00.

02:16.636 --> 02:17.869
Michelle, hey!

02:17.904 --> 02:20.005
Wow, you look great.

02:20.039 --> 02:22.040
Hey, I thought I missed you,

02:22.075 --> 02:23.909
but then I saw your purse
on the back of that chair.

02:23.943 --> 02:26.778
I did not look through it, but I figured
what lady leaves without her purse?

02:26.813 --> 02:29.681
For you.
African roses

02:29.716 --> 02:31.850
and the new fall pumps...
hot off the assembly line.

02:31.884 --> 02:33.986
Thank you, Hubbell.
That's very sweet of you.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.921
You are welcome.

02:35.955 --> 02:37.990
Gosh, seeing you again...

02:38.024 --> 02:39.725
You just get prettier,
you know it?

02:39.759 --> 02:41.760
- Oh, I don't think so.
- Well, you do.

02:41.794 --> 02:43.829
Listen, I took
the liberty of making us

02:43.863 --> 02:45.931
a dinner reservation for tonight.
How does steak sound?

02:45.965 --> 02:47.866
- Uhh...
- I didn't get a chance to take you to dinner

02:47.900 --> 02:50.002
the last time I was in town.
You had that sudden terrible flu, remember?

02:50.036 --> 02:53.638
Oh, I do. God, that was a doozy.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.641
It's lingering. Listen, I can't go
out to dinner with you tonight.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.010
I have a very important
appointment in the morning

02:58.044 --> 03:00.746
and I need to go home
and sleep, but I bet you

03:00.780 --> 03:04.816
that Talia, and Hillary, and Lucy
would love to go out with you.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.785
Right, girls?
Dinner, steak, yum?

03:06.819 --> 03:08.653
- Yeah, sure.
- I'll eat.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.956
See? Now you have
a harem... very Vegas.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.592
Are you sure you couldn't
have one drink first?

03:13.626 --> 03:14.860
I can't, I'm sorry.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.762
I wish I had known
you were gonna be in town.

03:16.796 --> 03:18.864
Well, I left three messages
and sent that telegram.

03:18.898 --> 03:21.066
But next time I promise, okay?

03:21.100 --> 03:23.702
Uh, thanks for the gifts.
Super sweet.

03:23.736 --> 03:27.839
There's a pair of Dr. Scholl's in
the box, so open it carefully.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.642
- We're just gonna get changed.
- Oh.

03:30.676 --> 03:33.078
So what do we have
to do for this dinner?

03:33.112 --> 03:34.980
- Nothing.
- Really?

03:35.014 --> 03:37.983
Guys just get
weirder and weirder.

03:41.888 --> 03:45.857
97, 98, 99, 100.

03:51.664 --> 03:52.864

04:11.084 --> 04:12.784
Hi. You're on time!

04:12.819 --> 04:15.620
Jimmy, hi. I'm ignoring the
surprise in your voice.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.689
I'm sorry. It's just
a little crazy here today.

04:17.723 --> 04:20.725
Okay, so the job is six weeks here
in Vegas, six months on the road.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.894
The director is Gary Janetti.
I've told him all about you.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.763
- Whoa. Thank you.
- With editing.

04:24.797 --> 04:27.799
Gary. Gary,
this is Michelle Simms.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.968
I told you about her.
She's auditioning for the swing position.

04:30.002 --> 04:31.069
<i>I'm so excited
to dance for you.</i>

04:31.104 --> 04:32.804
I've already run her
through the routines.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.639
- So whenever you're ready...
- No.

04:34.674 --> 04:37.008
- What?
- But I'm 25.

04:37.043 --> 04:39.744
- She's not right.
- She's really good.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.012
Please just let me
show you the routine.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.849
- I swear you won't be sorry.
- Gary, please. For me.

04:43.883 --> 04:46.785
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
I'm sure you're great. Good luck.

04:46.819 --> 04:50.622
<i>Where was that list?</i>
<i>No, the list that you just had.</i>

04:50.656 --> 04:51.823
Gary. Gary.

04:51.858 --> 04:54.059
Please, just give me
five minutes with this girl.

04:54.093 --> 04:57.762

<i>- Hey, I was wondering if Michelle is here yet.</i>

06:17.677 --> 06:19.344
Are you kidding me?
He's still here?

06:19.378 --> 06:21.580
He talked about you
all night long.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.715
"Michelle is so beautiful.
Michelle is so smart.

06:23.749 --> 06:26.585
Usually tall girls are intimidating.
Michelle's not intimidating.

06:26.619 --> 06:29.387
She's wonderful."
Dinner was delicious, though.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.357
- He's not cheap, this guy.
- I can't deal with this right now.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.459
Just tell him I died
and I'll see him next month.

06:34.493 --> 06:36.628
Aha, Hubbell.
Hi, you scared me.

06:36.662 --> 06:38.463
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:38.497 --> 06:39.631
I should've walked up
more slowly, I guess.

06:39.665 --> 06:41.800
Gosh!
You look wonderful.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.768
- Thank you.
- Hey, how'd the audition go?

06:43.803 --> 06:46.605
- It went great. Fine.
- I knew it. I knew it would.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.540
- Here.
- Thanks.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.642
Um, Hubbell, I need to start
getting ready for the show.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.477
Okay, just open
your present first.

06:52.511 --> 06:54.446
Sure.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.353
- Hubbell.
- Do you like it?

07:01.387 --> 07:03.521
Do I like it?
It's stunning.

07:03.556 --> 07:06.791
I've never gotten something
so beautiful in my life.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.530
My audition did not go great.

07:12.565 --> 07:15.767
It was a disaster.
He wouldn't even let me dance.

07:17.637 --> 07:18.803
Michelle?

07:20.539 --> 07:22.607
Can I take you to dinner
after the show?

07:22.642 --> 07:25.443
If you like, we can order
nothing but dessert.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.679
Sure.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.515
Dinner would be great.

07:32.551 --> 07:36.421
"No."
That was it... "no."

07:36.455 --> 07:38.390
"Hey, Gary,
this is Michelle."

07:38.424 --> 07:40.725
"No." It was
so humiliating.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.527
Everybody in the theater
just watching

07:42.561 --> 07:45.630
as the over-the-hill loser
gets the big heave-ho.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.334
You know, I've been trying
to get this audition

07:49.368 --> 07:50.635
for a million years
and I finally get it

07:50.670 --> 07:52.771
- and I don't even get to dance.
- You are not over the hill.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.473
If a director can just look at you
and say "no" after three seconds,

07:55.508 --> 07:57.409
it's not "no" 'cause
you're so young and hot.

07:57.443 --> 07:59.577
It's "no" 'cause you're starting
to look like an IHOP cashier.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.680
Hey seriously, dude, "keep 'em
coming" was not a euphemism.

08:01.714 --> 08:04.549
There's an IHOP down
the street from my office.

08:04.583 --> 08:08.320
The cashier's name is Julie and
she's a very attractive woman.

08:08.354 --> 08:10.622
Oh man, this is so pretty.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.691
You are so nice to me.
Why are you so nice to me?

08:12.725 --> 08:15.327
- I'm not that nice to you.
- Oh, what are you talking about?

08:15.361 --> 08:19.464
You bring me shoes and flowers, and
sparkly watches, and you feed my friends.

08:19.498 --> 08:22.567
You keep coming back even though I
blow you off like 90% of the time.

08:22.601 --> 08:24.469
I don't think
the percentage is that high.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.471
Oh, it is.
I'm awful to you.

08:26.505 --> 08:29.441
- I'm just awful.
- I don't think you're awful.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.743
I think you're the most
spectacular girl in the world.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.679
First time I ever saw you
on stage, I thought "wow!"

08:34.714 --> 08:36.748
Did I fall?
<i>You did not fall.</i>

08:37.750 --> 08:39.417
You were perfect.

08:41.419 --> 08:43.587
Have I ever told you
about where I live?

08:45.691 --> 08:48.760
I live in this beautiful
town called paradise.

08:48.794 --> 08:50.695
- Paradise?
- <i>It's right on the coast.</i>

08:50.730 --> 08:53.431
Right by the ocean
so it's always breezy.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.701
And my house is up on a bluff
with big trees in the backyard.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.603
And in my bedroom,

08:58.637 --> 09:02.240
there are these big glass doors
that open onto a balcony

09:02.274 --> 09:04.442
and when you stand there,
all you see...

09:05.444 --> 09:06.611
Is the beautiful blue ocean.

09:07.646 --> 09:09.547
Wow.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.583
I live next door to a hooker.

09:11.617 --> 09:14.519
<i>Look, I know you don't</i>
<i>know me from Adam,</i>

09:14.553 --> 09:16.521
but I want to take care of you.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.556
That is so nice.

09:18.591 --> 09:21.626
Isn't that nice?
Do we know them?

09:21.660 --> 09:24.529
Michelle,

09:24.563 --> 09:26.297
let me take care of you.

09:26.332 --> 09:27.632
- I don't understand...
- Marry me.

09:27.666 --> 09:29.534
Oh, Hubbell, no!

09:29.568 --> 09:32.604
- I can make you happy.
- No, you don't understand.

09:32.638 --> 09:35.573
I suck at relationships.
I'm like Godzilla.

09:35.608 --> 09:37.409
Men run from me.
They flee.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.644
And not just Japanese men.
All nationalities flee.

09:39.678 --> 09:42.447
- I won't flee.
- Buy some comfortable shoes.

09:42.481 --> 09:44.582
I promise you, I won't flee.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.718
<i>I'll be the one scientist</i>
<i>who understands you.</i>

09:46.752 --> 09:50.355
The one who knows that you're not burning
the city down because you're evil,

09:50.389 --> 09:53.625
you're burning the city down
to protect the giant lizard eggs

09:53.659 --> 09:56.528
you just laid
in a cave by the ocean.

09:56.562 --> 09:59.531
A cave no one knows is there...

09:59.565 --> 10:01.599
But me.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.569
God, that's beautiful.

10:04.603 --> 10:07.472
<i>No.</i>
<i>You're beautiful.</i>

10:07.506 --> 10:09.741
And you deserve to be happy.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.479
What do you say?

11:00.785 --> 11:03.553
Passe releve.

11:05.723 --> 11:08.391
Port de bras.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.661
Shoulders, Melanie.

11:15.733 --> 11:18.668
Lovely, Sasha.

11:24.675 --> 11:26.743
Po-po in, boo.

11:33.551 --> 11:35.652
Where are you looking, Ginny?

11:37.655 --> 11:38.822
Passe releve.

11:38.856 --> 11:43.460
Balance, hold hold hold hold.

11:44.462 --> 11:46.529
And relax.

11:46.564 --> 11:49.466
<i>Oh please, so dramatic.</i>

11:49.500 --> 11:53.403
Mr. Balanchine once made us do grande
battements for two and a half hours.

11:53.437 --> 11:55.705
We only stopped when
someone finally dropped dead.

11:55.740 --> 11:58.374
All right, everyone, stretch.

12:00.811 --> 12:02.645
I started stretching
every night.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.381
- I'll be able to do that soon.
- I'll alert the media.

12:05.416 --> 12:06.549
Now you're just showing off.

12:06.584 --> 12:07.817
God, it's a stretch, boo.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.686
So you don't have extension.
You can jump.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.455
- Boys jump.
- So be a boy.

12:12.490 --> 12:14.624
- Ballet always needs boys.
- Funny, Melanie.

12:14.658 --> 12:16.726
At least you don't have to wear
two bras under your leotard.

12:16.761 --> 12:19.462
- You really wear two bras?
- I don't want to talk about it.

12:19.497 --> 12:20.663
You brought it up.

12:21.766 --> 12:23.767
I think I'm gonna be sick.

12:25.669 --> 12:28.605
Well, this is it.
Our home.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.843
- Huh.
- Shall we?

12:36.514 --> 12:39.315
It's a little eclectic, I know.

12:39.350 --> 12:42.385
I let my mother
decorate the place.

12:42.419 --> 12:46.356
- How very Graceland of you.
- Well, she enjoys things being a bit...

12:46.390 --> 12:48.591
Theatrical, dramatic.

12:48.626 --> 12:51.528
There's a lot of...

12:51.562 --> 12:54.697
- well, you'll just have to meet her for yourself.
- I cannot wait.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.403
- Mother's a Buddhist.
- Oh.

13:00.437 --> 13:03.339
Hey hey, I tell you what.
Let's go see the den.

13:03.374 --> 13:06.342
Wait wait, were the flowers to the
right or the left of the ZZ Top guy?

13:06.377 --> 13:08.278
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
It's all good.

13:08.312 --> 13:09.746
- Can she still pray?
- Oh yeah, she'll be fine.

13:09.780 --> 13:11.381
What's with the cookies?

13:42.746 --> 13:44.681
And thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

13:46.383 --> 13:47.750
Now before you go,

13:47.785 --> 13:50.353
we still have not found
that missing tutu.

13:50.387 --> 13:52.755
If it doesn't show up by the
15th, we will have to cut Clara

13:52.790 --> 13:55.792
from "the nutcracker" which
will make us look ridiculous.

13:55.826 --> 14:00.363
Check your brothers' closets. That's where we
found sleeping beauty's costume last year.

14:00.397 --> 14:04.300
<i>Also the head of the Joffrey</i>
<i>School of Ballet</i>

14:04.335 --> 14:05.735
<i>will be coming here</i>
<i>to hold auditions</i>

14:05.769 --> 14:09.272
next week for their summer
scholarship program.

14:09.306 --> 14:13.343
<i>I want all of you to
perform at your very best.</i>

14:13.377 --> 14:15.645
<i>Do not humiliate me.</i>
<i>I am old.</i>

14:15.679 --> 14:17.680
Any tiny shock could kill me.

14:17.715 --> 14:21.317
The sign-up sheet's on the desk.
Class dismissed.

14:23.554 --> 14:26.322
- Ginny, are you going to sign up?
- No.

14:26.357 --> 14:28.324
- Why?
- There's no way I'll get in.

14:28.359 --> 14:31.361
- But you're a really good dancer.
- They want bodies like Sasha.

14:31.395 --> 14:33.630
I'm going to end up selling
real estate like my mother.

14:33.664 --> 14:37.367
- Do you think I should try out?
- Not in a snoopy leotard.

14:37.401 --> 14:39.669
- I'm talking to Ginny.
- Try out, don't try out,

14:39.703 --> 14:41.571
who cares?
It's school.

14:41.605 --> 14:44.374
A whole
summer of school. That's fun.

14:44.408 --> 14:46.309
But you're gonna
try out, right?

14:46.343 --> 14:48.611
It's not like I've got
anything better to do.

15:09.700 --> 15:13.536
- The whole house is looking at me.
- And finally,

15:13.570 --> 15:15.705
this is our room.

15:24.581 --> 15:27.383
Oh Hubbell.

15:27.418 --> 15:30.420
- I could stand here forever.
- That's my plan.

15:30.454 --> 15:32.655
You didn't let your mother take
a crack at this room, did you?

15:32.690 --> 15:35.358
No, she got the rest of the house.
This is mine.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.527
- I can see why you love it.
- You're going to love it too.

15:37.561 --> 15:40.363
- Yeah. If I never leave this spot.
- Hey, this is your house now.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.699
- We can do whatever you want to make it more comfortable.
- Really?

15:42.733 --> 15:45.401
- Can we get rid of the...
<i>- What?</i>

15:45.436 --> 15:48.371
- Mom!
- Yes... mom. I'm here. Who's this?

15:48.405 --> 15:51.708
- This is Michelle.
- Namaste.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.710
- What?
- 'Cause you're Buddha.

15:53.744 --> 15:56.312
- "Ist."
- ... Ist, Buddhist.

15:56.347 --> 15:58.548
Well, hello, Michelle.
I am Fanny, Hubbell's mother.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.717
What was it in my house
you wanted to get rid of?

16:00.751 --> 16:03.353
Your house?
Her house?

16:03.387 --> 16:06.689
- Our house actually.
- Our house, like our house?

16:06.724 --> 16:08.591
No our house like our house.

16:08.625 --> 16:12.362
But... wait. You live with your
mother like a serial killer?

16:12.396 --> 16:16.432
Michelle, could I have
a second alone with mom, please?

16:16.500 --> 16:19.602
Sure. I'll just be... Somewhere.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.676
<i>You what?!</i>

16:44.795 --> 16:47.530
- Class is over, boo.
- Five minutes.

16:47.564 --> 16:50.333
- Five minutes is not going to help.
- How does it look?

16:50.367 --> 16:51.534
- I'm starving.
- Me too.

16:51.568 --> 16:53.603
- Is my line long?
- There's a mirror right there.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.638
- If I look I'm gonna fall.
- Let's get pizza.

16:55.672 --> 16:58.641
Just look first. I don't know what you did.
What did you do?

16:58.675 --> 17:00.610
You have to square off
your shoulders.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.378
Who said that?
Who's talking?

17:02.413 --> 17:04.446
Your right shoulder's
pulled too far back.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.516
You have to square it off.

17:06.550 --> 17:08.483
- Hey, it's working!
- Who's that?

17:08.519 --> 17:11.686
Now lift your leg a little
higher, chin up... voila.

17:11.722 --> 17:14.656
That was so cool.
That was like suddenly I could hold it!

17:14.691 --> 17:16.559
That's how it works.
One day it just clicks.

17:16.593 --> 17:18.627
That was so satisfying.

17:18.662 --> 17:22.365
- Who are you?
- She is my daughter-in-law.

17:22.398 --> 17:24.333
- Aren't you?
- Uh...

17:24.367 --> 17:27.569
They got married in Las Vegas.
Isn't that romantic?

17:27.604 --> 17:31.507
- Did Elvis do the ceremony?
- No, just the guy who owned the drive-through.

17:31.542 --> 17:33.676
Well, I see you're
a very traditional girl.

17:33.710 --> 17:35.678
Anyhow, girls,
I'd like you to meet...

17:35.712 --> 17:38.714
- what's your name?
- Michelle.

17:38.749 --> 17:41.484
And these are some of the girls
from my advanced class.

17:41.518 --> 17:44.520
Melanie, Ginny, Sasha and boo.

17:44.555 --> 17:47.757
- Hey there.
- Now if you'll excuse us, we have a lot to do.

17:47.791 --> 17:52.361
I have decided to throw you a
welcome-to-the-family party tonight.

17:52.396 --> 17:55.364
- Oh no, that's not necessary.
- I've already called everyone

17:55.399 --> 17:57.433
and told them to spread
the word. You're welcome.

17:57.468 --> 18:00.503
- You girls are all invited too.
- Oh no, you guys don't have to come.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.339
You'll be so bored. It'll just be a
bunch of old people standing around.

18:03.373 --> 18:04.574
Including me.
I'm an oldie too.

18:04.608 --> 18:07.276
- Do you not want us to come?
- Well first, I don't know you.

18:07.311 --> 18:09.312
Second of all, it's Saturday night.
Don't you have,

18:09.346 --> 18:11.380
like, young people
Saturday-night stuff to do?

18:11.415 --> 18:12.582
- No.
- Really?

18:12.616 --> 18:14.350
Not since the movie
theater closed.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.685
Wait, there's no
movie theater in this town?

18:15.719 --> 18:18.421
It's not so bad. They open
the skating rink in November.

18:18.455 --> 18:20.323
And sometimes
Mr. Feldstein

18:20.357 --> 18:22.658
forgets to lock the library
door and we go in and read.

18:22.693 --> 18:25.461
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Or we just hang out here.

18:25.496 --> 18:27.630
You're all screwing
with me, right?

18:27.664 --> 18:31.634
Paradise is a sleepy town.
But we love it, and I'm sure you will too.

18:31.668 --> 18:35.304
Okay, I'm so sorry.
How far away is the nearest movie theater?

18:35.339 --> 18:38.407
Okay, girls, go home and get prettied
and we'll see you back here at 6:00.

18:39.610 --> 18:40.710
Bye.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.279
Fanny, I don't really
need a party.

18:43.313 --> 18:46.716
My son just got married and I
didn't get to be at the ceremony,

18:46.750 --> 18:48.684
- so I'd like to be at the party.
- Sure.

18:48.719 --> 18:50.353
- You understand?
- I do.

18:50.387 --> 18:51.687
- You approve?
- Of course.

18:51.722 --> 18:54.357
- Because God forbid I offend you.
- I am not offended.

18:54.391 --> 18:56.626
You're not offended that I want
to throw you a wedding party

18:56.660 --> 18:58.694
after missing the wedding?
I am so relieved.

18:58.729 --> 19:01.597
Now you go get changed and I
will see to everything else.

19:01.632 --> 19:03.666
Oh, I don't really have
anything else to wear.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.668
You must've packed
something that works.

19:06.670 --> 19:08.571
You must've packed.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.574
- You're not pregnant, are you?
- Oh God, no.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.576
No no no, not pregnant.

19:13.610 --> 19:17.380
No, um, we just got so carried away in the
moment that I didn't think about clothes.

19:17.414 --> 19:20.283
Is there someplace around here
that I could go buy something?

19:20.317 --> 19:23.252
Absolutely. Just go
down the street here,

19:23.287 --> 19:25.555
make a right and look
for a store called "sparkles."

19:25.589 --> 19:27.657
Okay. Thanks.
I'll go there now.

20:05.420 --> 20:07.521
Hi, I'm Truly.
Can I help you?

20:07.555 --> 20:09.523
Oh, I'm just looking
for something.

20:11.559 --> 20:14.528
Oh, I'm not really a duck person,
but that's great. Really.

20:14.562 --> 20:17.464
Are you looking
for something specific?

20:17.498 --> 20:18.732
A dress for a party.

20:18.766 --> 20:21.468
A birthday party?
Graduation party?

20:21.502 --> 20:23.703
Wedding party, actually.
My wedding.

20:23.738 --> 20:26.306
So something black with a veil.

20:26.340 --> 20:28.675
- You're her.
- I'm...

20:28.709 --> 20:31.645
- The pole dancer from Reno.
- I'm not a pole dancer.

20:31.679 --> 20:34.514
- Who said I was a pole dancer?
- They said you weren't pretty.

20:34.549 --> 20:36.550
You weren't supposed
to be pretty.

20:36.584 --> 20:37.717
Please wait.
Don't cry.

20:37.752 --> 20:39.719
Truly, are you okay?
What's the matter?

20:39.754 --> 20:42.522
- Oh God, it's the stripper from Tahoe.
- I'm not a stripper.

20:42.557 --> 20:45.325
She's pretty, Sam.
She wasn't supposed to be pretty.

20:45.359 --> 20:47.594
It's a manufactured pretty.
It's a kit... a pretty kit.

20:47.628 --> 20:50.497
- Okay, I'm going to go.
- No, you can't. You need something for the party.

20:50.531 --> 20:53.567
- Please, I don't need...
- No, this wedding party is for you

20:53.601 --> 20:55.635
and H-Hubbell, right?

20:55.670 --> 20:59.206
- Uh... yes.
- Well, this is the first time

20:59.240 --> 21:01.408
he's going to introduce you
to the world as his wife.

21:01.442 --> 21:03.276
He cannot see you
in a t-shirt and shorts.

21:03.311 --> 21:05.312
He's already seen me pee
behind a cactus in pahrump

21:05.346 --> 21:07.547
so I don't think a little casualwear
is gonna kill the deal now.

21:07.582 --> 21:09.282
- Wait here.
- Please...

21:09.307 --> 21:12.007
You took the only man
I ever loved in my life

21:12.052 --> 21:15.687
so the least you can do
is wait... <i>here</i>!

21:19.360 --> 21:21.461
It was Vegas, by the way.
Not Tahoe.

21:21.496 --> 21:23.263
- No one cares.
- Right.

21:23.297 --> 21:24.564
Here.

21:24.599 --> 21:26.466
Wow.

21:26.501 --> 21:28.602
Oh, this is...

21:28.636 --> 21:31.404
- forgive the pun, truly beautiful.
- I know.

21:31.439 --> 21:32.606
- She knows.
- Can I try it on?

21:32.640 --> 21:34.207
It will fit.

21:34.242 --> 21:35.509
I made it, so I know
it will fit.

21:35.543 --> 21:37.377
And it's going to look
really good

21:37.411 --> 21:40.213
because you are tall
and you have very long legs.

21:40.248 --> 21:42.415
Do you need shoes?

21:43.451 --> 21:45.619
Please follow me.

21:53.361 --> 21:55.462
I swear they're bigger today
than yesterday.

21:55.496 --> 21:58.298
You have an unhealthy
obsession with your boobs.

21:58.332 --> 21:59.533
I know.
Just like my mother.

22:01.402 --> 22:03.236
- Do you want?
- No.

22:03.271 --> 22:05.405
I'm on a diet.
Joffrey auditions are next week.

22:05.439 --> 22:07.507
How much thinner are you
going to be in a week?

22:07.542 --> 22:09.242
I don't know.
Thinner.

22:09.277 --> 22:11.478
I'm bored. I'm going
to go find beer.

22:13.181 --> 22:15.515
I couldn't have
gotten my mother's nose.

22:15.550 --> 22:17.384
Sorry I'm late.

22:17.418 --> 22:19.619
- Where's Sasha?
- She's looking for beer.

22:19.654 --> 22:22.222
Oh, cool.

22:47.582 --> 22:50.483
- Madame Fanny?
- Yes, boo?

22:50.518 --> 22:54.254
Um, about the joffrey
auditions next week,

22:54.288 --> 22:56.323
I was thinking I was
going to try out,

22:56.357 --> 22:59.292
so I just wanted
to ask you... should I?

22:59.327 --> 23:02.362
- Well, it certainly can't hurt.
- I know but...

23:02.396 --> 23:04.197
should I?
I mean,

23:04.232 --> 23:06.166
am I wasting my time?

23:07.301 --> 23:10.370
I mean, I know that if I
could dance like Sasha...

23:10.404 --> 23:13.440
And I know that I can turn and
I can jump, but I'm not a boy,

23:13.474 --> 23:16.543
so I just wanted
to ask you should I... try?

23:18.479 --> 23:21.248
Ballet is very hard, boo.

23:21.282 --> 23:24.451
And a lot of it does depend
on how you're made.

23:24.485 --> 23:27.254
You have to be realistic.

23:27.288 --> 23:31.191
You're a big-boned girl. You have a tummy.
Your waist is very short...

23:31.225 --> 23:34.227
- okay, thank you.
- But none of that means you shouldn't try.

23:34.262 --> 23:35.595
Right?

23:35.630 --> 23:37.564
Mm-hmm.

23:39.433 --> 23:41.501
Now if you'll excuse me,

23:41.535 --> 23:44.337
I probably should
make my appearance.

23:44.372 --> 23:45.672
I'll see you inside.

24:01.355 --> 24:03.523
She was right,
the little freak.

24:04.625 --> 24:07.427
Okay, here goes nothing.

24:32.320 --> 24:35.221
- Oh God, this is terrible.
- Hey, there she is!

24:35.256 --> 24:38.425
Hubbell, thank God. I've never been more
excited to see anyone in my entire life.

24:38.459 --> 24:40.527
Where have you been?
People are pointing and staring.

24:40.561 --> 24:42.462
And that wine...
have you had the wine?

24:42.496 --> 24:44.531
My mother is kind of known
for her cheap hooch.

24:44.565 --> 24:47.500
- Wow! That is some dress.
- Yeah?

24:47.535 --> 24:49.636
- You look so beautiful.
- You look nice too.

24:49.670 --> 24:52.572
Well okay. Well, let me
introduce you to everyone.

24:52.606 --> 24:55.275
Everyone, everyone,

24:55.309 --> 24:57.577
this is my wife.

24:57.611 --> 25:00.547
I can't believe
I get to say that...

25:00.581 --> 25:02.515
my wife.
Anyhow,

25:02.550 --> 25:05.385
this is my wife Michelle.
Michelle, this is everyone.

25:05.419 --> 25:07.554
Hey there, everybody.

25:07.588 --> 25:10.156
<i>Hi, Truly.</i>

25:10.191 --> 25:11.491
Hi.

25:11.525 --> 25:14.127
I just want to say
thank you all for coming

25:14.161 --> 25:16.396
and better wine is on the way.

25:16.430 --> 25:19.532
What is wrong with my wine?
It has a nun on the label and everything.

25:19.567 --> 25:21.234
Hello, mother.

25:21.268 --> 25:22.569
So? How do you like
your party?

25:22.603 --> 25:24.504
- It's a great party.
- Good turnout.

25:24.538 --> 25:27.407
It's not every day we have a
"playboy" playmate in our midst.

25:27.441 --> 25:29.509
- She's not a "playboy"...
- Look at that dress.

25:29.543 --> 25:31.411
Truly has outdone herself.

25:31.445 --> 25:33.313
- You met Truly?
- I did.

25:33.347 --> 25:35.482
- You know, she and Hubbell used to date.
- Mother, don't.

25:35.516 --> 25:37.484
Oh honey, it was going
to come out eventually.

25:37.518 --> 25:40.620
The breakup was hard.
We still don't let her have scissors.

25:40.654 --> 25:44.290
Now let's introduce you
to the book club.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.326
- Do you read?
- I'm so sorry.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.328
I think I need
to get a little air.

25:57.638 --> 25:59.572
Michelle?

26:02.576 --> 26:04.444
You all right?

26:04.478 --> 26:07.480
This is a really
beautiful view.

26:07.515 --> 26:11.217
You said it was a
beautiful view and it is.

26:11.252 --> 26:13.219
I'm glad you like it.

26:13.254 --> 26:15.388
- But you didn't tell me you lived with your mother.
- I know.

26:15.423 --> 26:17.524
And I mean, you really
live with your mother.

26:17.558 --> 26:19.325
She's everywhere.
This is her house.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.261
Oh, it's my house.
I paid for it.

26:21.295 --> 26:22.562
She has a dance studio
in the back.

26:22.596 --> 26:25.198
Her whole life is here.
You didn't tell me any of that.

26:25.232 --> 26:28.168
I was so stunned when you said
yes, I didn't want to jinx it.

26:28.202 --> 26:30.336
That's a really big thing
to keep from somebody.

26:30.371 --> 26:33.473
And you have this town,
and friends,

26:33.507 --> 26:35.608
and Truly has got some serious

26:35.643 --> 26:38.511
I'm-driving-cross-country-
in-diapers-to-kill-you potential.

26:38.546 --> 26:41.481
- And your mother hates me.
- Oh, she's hurt, she's proud.

26:41.515 --> 26:43.450
She'll come around.
She just...

26:43.484 --> 26:45.552
I don't love you, Hubbell.

26:47.488 --> 26:50.390
I'm sorry, but I don't.

26:52.593 --> 26:55.595
I've never loved
anybody, really.

26:57.331 --> 26:59.532
I don't think
I'm made that way.

26:59.567 --> 27:03.503
And you're so wonderful.
You deserve to have somebody love you.

27:05.372 --> 27:08.107
I know you don't love me.

27:08.142 --> 27:11.177
I'm not an idiot.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.480
But I don't believe
you're not made that way.

27:13.514 --> 27:15.281
- Hubbell...
- You want to love.

27:15.316 --> 27:17.283
You just haven't found
the right person yet.

27:17.318 --> 27:20.353
Maybe you don't trust that anybody
is going to understand you.

27:20.387 --> 27:22.455
But I do.

27:22.490 --> 27:25.258
I know exactly what you want.

27:25.292 --> 27:27.560
You want to laugh.

27:27.595 --> 27:31.231
And you want to travel.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.400
You want to be surprised

27:34.435 --> 27:37.303
and challenged.

27:37.338 --> 27:41.207
You want to live
an unexpected life.

27:43.310 --> 27:45.211
And I intend to give you
exactly that.

27:46.580 --> 27:49.549
Wow, good speech.

28:02.129 --> 28:03.596
Wow, good kiss.

28:09.436 --> 28:11.404
Where did you learn
to kiss like that?

28:11.438 --> 28:13.339
Oh God, don't say your mother!

28:17.981 --> 28:22.843
You hire a girl like that to jump
out of a cake. You do not marry her.

28:22.877 --> 28:24.744
Well, Hubbell has
some quirky ways.

28:24.779 --> 28:26.780
But I make dresses, he
sells shoes, I mean...

28:26.814 --> 28:28.715
- I know. Truly!
- I just... we're so...

28:28.749 --> 28:30.650
listen to me.
This won't last.

28:30.685 --> 28:33.687
She's a Vegas girl.
Hubbell will bore her and when he does...

28:33.721 --> 28:35.589
wow, the party's still
happening, huh?

28:35.623 --> 28:37.824
- Did the new wine show up yet?
- Let's go check.

28:37.859 --> 28:39.659
Will you excuse me, Truly?

28:39.694 --> 28:41.962
Ah yes.
Here we are.

28:41.996 --> 28:44.030
No nuns!

28:44.065 --> 28:46.600
What do you
two think you're doing?

28:46.634 --> 28:48.034
We're about to toast
our wedding.

28:48.069 --> 28:50.770
- And not do a spit-take after.
- Have you had sex?

28:50.805 --> 28:52.639
Ever?

28:52.673 --> 28:54.841
- Don't be smart.
- Mom, that's none of your business.

28:54.876 --> 28:56.977
This is my party!
I did not throw this party

28:57.011 --> 28:58.912
so the two of you could
have sex during it!

28:58.946 --> 29:00.814
Okay, clearly we've
dropped the whispering.

29:00.848 --> 29:02.716
Oh, am I embarrassing you?
I'm sorry.

29:02.750 --> 29:04.851
I wouldn't have thought a
person who just had sex

29:04.886 --> 29:08.622
during her mother-in-law's welcome-to-the-family
party would be quite so demure.

29:08.656 --> 29:10.757
- Okay, you need to calm down.
- I need to calm down?

29:10.791 --> 29:13.827
Oh, that's rich.
You go off to Vegas on a business trip,

29:13.861 --> 29:15.996
then you come back, hand me a
penn and teller coffee mug

29:16.030 --> 29:17.931
and say, "by the way
I just got married"?!

29:17.965 --> 29:19.933
I'm sorry.
<i>And then you bring her in here</i>

29:19.967 --> 29:22.569
and she proceeds to parade
around in shorts...

29:22.637 --> 29:24.905
- What do you have against shorts?
- No real lady wears shorts.

29:24.939 --> 29:26.740
In what century are we
having this conversation?

29:26.774 --> 29:30.010
Oh my God! The quips, the chatter.
Don't you ever just shut up?

29:30.044 --> 29:31.845
Mom!

29:35.816 --> 29:37.784
Now you listen to me...

29:37.818 --> 29:40.854
you can all listen to me.

29:40.888 --> 29:42.756
That woman is my wife.

29:42.790 --> 29:46.593
I am sorry if I didn't break it to
you in the way you would've liked,

29:46.627 --> 29:50.730
but this is my house and I will not
have her talked to like that by you.

29:52.066 --> 29:54.834
Or anyone in this town!

29:56.671 --> 29:58.004
Got it?

30:01.909 --> 30:03.877
Oh God, he's wonderful.

30:03.911 --> 30:06.713
- Hubbell...
- I love her.

30:07.949 --> 30:09.883
Nothing more to say.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.731
I think my dad is gay.

30:22.757 --> 30:24.090
- Based on what?
- Just a feeling.

30:24.125 --> 30:26.092
- More dads are these days.
- I would love to have a gay dad.

30:26.127 --> 30:27.827
- Why?
- Just seems fun.

30:27.862 --> 30:29.696
Like there would ba lot
of shopping and baking.

30:29.730 --> 30:31.798
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

30:31.832 --> 30:33.933
- Boo! Beer!
- No thanks.

30:33.968 --> 30:36.670
- Fine, more for me.
- You're going to make yourself sick.

30:36.704 --> 30:39.105
Am I?
Hold please.

30:46.747 --> 30:48.915
Two beers, I can still do that.

30:48.949 --> 30:51.818
- What can you do?
- You're a mean drunk.

30:51.852 --> 30:55.722
I'm not drunk. I'm bored.
This town is so boring!

30:55.756 --> 30:58.725
Maybe. But the property values
are going through the roof.

30:58.759 --> 31:00.727
I have got to get
some new friends.

31:00.761 --> 31:02.629
<i>Why don't you
suck up to Hubbell's wife?</i>

31:02.663 --> 31:03.897
<i>She can be your new friend.</i>

31:03.931 --> 31:05.899
God, I can't believe someone
actually married Hubbell.

31:05.933 --> 31:07.767
- <i>Talk about too many beers.</i>
<i>- Hiya, gals!</i>

31:07.802 --> 31:10.804
You having a little private party?
Can I crash?

31:10.838 --> 31:12.972
Domestic? Really?

31:13.007 --> 31:17.577
See, if you're going to consume totally empty...
and might I add illegal... calories

31:17.611 --> 31:19.779
at least it should
be from Belgium.

31:19.814 --> 31:21.681
Hey, cool pictures.
Is this you guys?

31:21.716 --> 31:23.717
- That's the Christmas recital.
- Nice.

31:23.751 --> 31:25.585
Are you dressed as socks?

31:25.619 --> 31:28.788
It was an original ballet
based on really bad gifts.

31:28.823 --> 31:30.857
Fanny's a little twisted.

31:30.891 --> 31:33.660
- You gotta give her that.
- So we heard you're a dancer.

31:33.694 --> 31:34.994
- You did?
- Are you?

31:35.029 --> 31:37.697
- I am.
- Where do you dance?

31:37.732 --> 31:40.800
- Until yesterday, Vegas.
- You were a showgirl?

31:40.835 --> 31:43.803
- <i>Yep.
- So you walked around with feathers on your head?</i>

31:43.838 --> 31:45.805
Okay, A, I didn't walk,
I danced.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.742
And B, there were a lot of feathers
on my head, like a flock full.

31:48.776 --> 31:51.611
And you think doing a double
pirouette is hard in pointe shoes...

31:51.645 --> 31:52.879
<i>You</i> can do a double pirouette?

31:52.913 --> 31:55.648
- I trained at A.B.T.
- How'd you end up in Vegas?

31:55.683 --> 31:58.518
- It paid better.
- So not in it for the art of it, huh?

31:58.552 --> 32:00.553
Why are you
being so mean? God.

32:00.588 --> 32:02.589
I think Vegas sounds exciting.

32:02.623 --> 32:04.491
It has a lot
of Victoria's secrets.

32:04.525 --> 32:06.760
You're the first professional
dancer I've ever met.

32:06.794 --> 32:09.929
- Well, except for Fanny.
- Fanny danced with Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.

32:09.964 --> 32:11.831
That's her
in "Coppelia."

32:11.866 --> 32:15.735
I think being a ballerina is the
most wonderful thing in the world.

32:15.770 --> 32:17.637
You want to be a bunhead, huh?

32:17.671 --> 32:19.806
Next week they're having auditions
for the joffrey summer program.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.908
God, I'm so tired of hearing about
the joffrey summer program.

32:21.942 --> 32:24.711
- <i>Blah blah blah.
- That's because you'll almost definitely get in.</i>

32:24.745 --> 32:26.746
I would do <i>anything to get
accepted, but I won't.</i>

32:26.781 --> 32:29.716
- Why not?
- Look at me.

32:29.750 --> 32:32.552
Well, auditions can be tricky.
Do you have a good audition outfit?

32:32.586 --> 32:35.522
- A what?
- You have to have a kickass audition outfit,

32:35.556 --> 32:37.657
something that makes you
feel really powerful.

32:37.691 --> 32:40.927
My go-to outfit was
a fire-engine red unitard

32:40.961 --> 32:43.696
with a thin gold belt
with tassels on it... classy.

32:43.731 --> 32:45.865
If I wore a red unitard,
I'd look like a crime scene.

32:45.900 --> 32:49.602
Everyone's outfit differs.
It just has to make you feel strong.

32:49.637 --> 32:51.771
That's the key
to any audition... attitude.

32:51.806 --> 32:53.973
She's talking about a ballet
audition, not a Vegas audition.

32:54.008 --> 32:55.909
An audition is an audition.

32:55.943 --> 32:57.777
You have to show up confident

32:57.812 --> 33:00.880
<i>and be ready to do or be anything
they want in an instant.</i>

33:00.915 --> 33:03.550
I once got an audition
for a Broadway show.

33:03.584 --> 33:05.585
Totally last minute.

33:05.619 --> 33:07.720
I grabbed my bag,
I ran 30 blocks,

33:07.755 --> 33:10.523
I walked in the door...
it was for "Dreamgirls."

33:10.558 --> 33:11.858
- I was supposed to be black.
- No way!

33:11.892 --> 33:13.560
- What happened?
- I got a callback.

33:13.594 --> 33:14.861
<i>- Shut up.</i>
<i>- Attitude, my friends.</i>

33:14.895 --> 33:16.863
What exactly happens
on an audition?

33:16.897 --> 33:18.965
- I mean, what's it like?
- Well, it's...

33:21.569 --> 33:23.703
Okay. Up.

33:23.737 --> 33:25.605
Everybody up.
Come on.

33:25.639 --> 33:27.907
Let's see.
First we need...

33:27.942 --> 33:30.743
Aha!

33:30.778 --> 33:32.645
All right, ladies,

33:32.680 --> 33:34.781
welcome to the audition
for the sequel to "cats,"

33:34.815 --> 33:37.817
working title "dogs." Sorry about
the 16-hour wait in the alley.

33:37.852 --> 33:40.620
I didn't know it was gonna rain.
Friggin' weather channel.

33:40.654 --> 33:41.855
16-hour wait?

33:41.889 --> 33:43.890
Yeah, every audition makes
you wait at least 16 hours.

33:43.924 --> 33:45.825
- That's terrible.
- Uh-huh. Here's your number.

33:45.860 --> 33:48.928
Your number is your name for
the duration of the audition.

33:48.963 --> 33:50.964
If we call "number six"
and you don't answer

33:50.998 --> 33:53.633
'cause you are waiting to hear
"Kathy," you're out of luck.

33:53.667 --> 33:55.802
- This is inhuman.
- Are you auditioning?

33:55.836 --> 33:58.605
- This is stupid.
- If you're not auditioning get your butt off my floor

33:58.639 --> 34:00.673
before someone <i>jetes</i>
<i>through your head.</i>

34:00.708 --> 34:02.675
All right,

34:02.710 --> 34:04.511
Move move move.

34:04.545 --> 34:06.813
All right, we need some music.

34:06.847 --> 34:10.516
Music, all right, where's
shabba-doo when you need him?

34:11.851 --> 34:13.652
Oh God.

Six in the front,

36:33.794 --> 36:35.528
But I did the whole thing
that time.

36:35.562 --> 36:38.631
I know. I'm just switching things up.
12 in the back.

36:38.666 --> 36:40.566
Move.

36:41.635 --> 36:43.503
<i>All right, you guys, this time?</i>

36:43.537 --> 36:46.639

Nice.
Leave your number at the door.

37:13.901 --> 37:15.902
We'll call you...
or not.

37:15.936 --> 37:19.472
Hey, number six.

37:21.809 --> 37:23.743
Joffrey's gonna get
rocked next week.

37:24.878 --> 37:26.713
Thank you.

37:27.781 --> 37:29.549
- That was fun!
- Boo, you were so good!

37:29.583 --> 37:31.584
I know, right?

37:31.618 --> 37:33.753
Next week's audition is ballet

37:33.787 --> 37:36.589
with toe shoes.
It's totally different.

37:40.961 --> 37:43.896
Oh, I was just showing the girls
what it was like to audition.

37:43.931 --> 37:46.532
- For what?
- "Dogs."

37:46.567 --> 37:48.534
It's the sequel to "cats."

37:48.569 --> 37:50.703
I made that up.

37:50.738 --> 37:53.573
- Let's go.
- Go?

37:53.607 --> 37:55.675
Where?

38:03.417 --> 38:05.318
Sonya dear,

38:05.353 --> 38:07.521
two shots.
Leave the bottle.

38:07.555 --> 38:10.557
<i>♪ I bought a toothbrush,</i>
<i>some toothpaste... ♪</i>

38:10.591 --> 38:12.425
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

38:12.460 --> 38:15.228
- This is just weird.
- What, sitting here?

38:15.263 --> 38:17.464
You're used to dancing on
top of the bar, is that it?

38:17.498 --> 38:20.200
Okay look, I was
not a stripper.

38:20.234 --> 38:21.434
Or a hooker or a playmate.

38:21.469 --> 38:23.336
I know.
I googled you.

38:23.371 --> 38:25.238
- You did?
- Are you surprised?

38:25.273 --> 38:27.307
Well, you have a boombox.

38:27.341 --> 38:29.442
I am not one of those old women
who can't use a computer.

38:29.477 --> 38:32.245
- And that cd collection.
- What's wrong with my cd collection?

38:32.280 --> 38:34.414
So sad. You have got to give those
poor girls some better music

38:34.448 --> 38:37.117
- to listen to or there's going to be an uprising.
- Oh please.

38:37.151 --> 38:39.286
I'm just saying, it's arab spring
unless you discover iTunes pronto.

38:39.320 --> 38:43.189
You should've been a radio
personality or an auctioneer.

38:43.224 --> 38:45.592
Instead you decided to dance.

38:45.626 --> 38:47.561
To Hubbell.

38:48.563 --> 38:50.297
I'll drink to that.

38:55.436 --> 38:57.470
- You've done this before.
- Of course I have.

38:57.505 --> 39:00.307
There's no movie theater
in this town.

39:00.341 --> 39:02.375
A.B.T.!

39:02.410 --> 39:05.078
Full scholarship.

39:05.112 --> 39:07.480
Accepted into
the company at 17.

39:07.515 --> 39:10.150
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

39:10.184 --> 39:12.552
And then after a few years
with the company,

39:12.587 --> 39:16.089
you left and did some
chorus work on Broadway,

39:16.123 --> 39:17.390
and then Vegas?

39:17.425 --> 39:19.492
- Yep.
- Did you get injured?

39:19.527 --> 39:21.494
- No.
- Have a breakdown?

39:21.529 --> 39:24.331
- No.
- Develop a dirty ventriloquist act?

39:24.365 --> 39:26.266
A friend of mine got
a job at caesars

39:26.300 --> 39:28.401
and asked if I wanted
to come along and I did.

39:28.436 --> 39:30.437
I thought it would
be temporary.

39:30.471 --> 39:33.106
It was fun for a while...

39:33.140 --> 39:35.275
dance, party all night,
sleep all day.

39:35.309 --> 39:38.478
And then time slips away,
you know?

39:38.512 --> 39:42.148
I do.
I know very well.

39:42.183 --> 39:44.451
I hear you danced
with ballet russe.

39:44.485 --> 39:48.121
I did.
I was a soloist.

39:48.155 --> 39:50.357
That's amazing.
When did you retire?

39:50.391 --> 39:53.259
- When I got pregnant.
- Oh, how very "turning point."

39:53.294 --> 39:55.295
It was unplanned.

39:55.329 --> 39:58.331
And I thought "well, I can go
back after I have the baby,"

39:58.366 --> 40:01.301
but the father did not
decide to stay around

40:01.369 --> 40:03.403
and bills had to be paid so...

40:03.437 --> 40:05.605
I started teaching
to make ends meet.

40:05.640 --> 40:09.509
And, well, time slips
away, you know?

40:12.413 --> 40:15.148
You squandered
a lot of potential.

40:15.182 --> 40:17.283
- I know.
- Are you sorry?

40:17.318 --> 40:19.519
Every day of my life.

40:19.553 --> 40:22.622
I had all the gifts, all the tools,
I just had absolutely no focus.

40:22.657 --> 40:26.359
- Just like Sasha.
- Yeah, what is it with that kid?

40:26.394 --> 40:28.428
She doesn't seem
to like dancing at all.

40:28.462 --> 40:30.397
Sasha doesn't know
what she likes.

40:30.431 --> 40:32.198
Her mother is...

40:32.233 --> 40:34.334
well, she travels a lot

40:34.368 --> 40:36.469
- and her father is gay.
- Really?

40:36.504 --> 40:40.273
He won't come out. Thinks it's a
giant secret, but everyone knows.

40:40.307 --> 40:43.610
It's too bad. There are some
lovely single gay men in this town

40:43.644 --> 40:47.213
and Sasha would be so much happier
if he smiled once in a while.

40:47.248 --> 40:48.515
Well, everyone in their
own time, I guess.

40:48.549 --> 40:50.583
That's crap.

40:50.618 --> 40:53.386
Every moment you waste
in life is a sin.

40:53.421 --> 40:55.522
Nothing waits for you.
It all just moves on.

40:55.556 --> 40:58.224
Then you turn around one day
and your son is married.

40:58.259 --> 41:01.261
Look how you brought that back
around to me. Nice moves.

41:02.263 --> 41:03.496
Do you love him?

41:05.566 --> 41:09.502
- He knows that I don't.
- He thinks love will come.

41:09.537 --> 41:11.604
It could.
He's a terrific guy.

41:11.639 --> 41:14.174
And what about you?

41:14.208 --> 41:17.410
- Are you a terrific girl?
- I'm super handy around the house.

41:17.445 --> 41:19.512
That might be better
than love, actually.

41:19.547 --> 41:22.449
I didn't plan any of this,
you know.

41:23.651 --> 41:26.486
He just caught me
at a really bad time.

41:27.555 --> 41:30.190
My career is pointless.

41:30.224 --> 41:32.492
My apartment is a nightmare.

41:32.526 --> 41:35.428
I'm sick of partying.
I'm sick of Vegas.

41:35.463 --> 41:38.331
I'm sick of me, actually.

41:40.234 --> 41:42.569
I don't know what I'm doing
or where I'm going

41:42.603 --> 41:45.405
and he's just so kind.

41:47.374 --> 41:50.610
I've never had someone
so kind in my life.

41:54.381 --> 41:57.183
I think I could fall
in love with him.

41:59.220 --> 42:01.454
I'd sure like myself
a lot more if I did.

42:03.390 --> 42:04.591
Well...

42:04.625 --> 42:06.526
I love my son.

42:08.195 --> 42:10.363
I want him to be happy.

42:10.397 --> 42:12.232
So...

42:14.301 --> 42:17.170
Let's see if you and I can dance together.

42:17.204 --> 42:20.273
- To this?
- I love Jim croce.
