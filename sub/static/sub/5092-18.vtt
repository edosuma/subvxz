WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:02.370
Previously on Blue Bloods...

00:02.403 --> 00:03.371
Yet another example

00:03.404 --> 00:04.605
of Commissioner Reagan's
extreme tactics and one

00:04.638 --> 00:08.542
that I don't see him practicing
in the white neighborhoods.

00:08.576 --> 00:09.777
This guy is dangerous.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.145
Only if you're standing

00:11.179 --> 00:12.713
between him
and a television camera.

00:12.746 --> 00:15.183
We supported Mayor Poole
in his election,

00:15.216 --> 00:18.219
and we demand
that he remove Frank Reagan

00:18.252 --> 00:19.620
as Police Commissioner.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.255
No willingness
to work together.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.823
No interest
in building consensus.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.826
A genuine leader
is not a seeker of consensus,

00:25.859 --> 00:29.463
but a molder of consensus.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.310
Potter,
you're early.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.712
Commissioner Reagan,
good to see you as always.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.314
New look?

00:46.347 --> 00:47.848
Part of a spiritual
rebirth, if you will.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.084
A new church, a new
outlook, a new me.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.720
Couldn't help noticing
the reporters camped outside.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.855
Thought we might say a few
words after the meeting.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.657
No, thank you.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.392
I won't keep you waiting long.

00:58.426 --> 01:01.395
There's just one thing I have
to take care of. Excuse me.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.772
This isn't gonna work.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.174
What, you don't like the beard?

01:13.207 --> 01:14.708
The guy should be a felon.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.244
And yet, it didn't
surprise you

01:16.277 --> 01:17.878
when he walked
on a technicality.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.747
We had a case.
No, we didn't.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.882
That's why we leaked the story.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.118
Well, I don't like him.
Nor he you.

01:24.152 --> 01:26.420
But this is the mayor's baby,
and Potter comes with.

01:28.456 --> 01:31.725
Frank, the gun buyback program
does some good.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.295
Oh, half the guns
we pay 200 bucks for

01:34.328 --> 01:35.763
are barely functioning relics.

01:35.796 --> 01:36.897
It's not Antiques Roadshow.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.399
We're just getting them
off the street.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.700
And if somebody's smart,
they could dump evidence,

01:39.733 --> 01:40.834
and we got to pay them for it.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.203
Chance you take

01:42.236 --> 01:43.304
for a greater good.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.273
That's not worthy of you,

01:45.306 --> 01:47.775
and I would rather have the
money for more officer training.

01:47.808 --> 01:48.909
Frank, we already

01:48.942 --> 01:51.712
said yes to this, so what
are we talking about here?

01:51.745 --> 01:52.846
I'm just venting.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.583
We're putting him back
on the map with this, Garrett.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.185
In exchange for which
he's helping us

01:57.218 --> 01:58.819
get the word out
in the community.

01:58.852 --> 01:59.620
They trust him.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.655
And if even a
little of that trust

02:01.689 --> 02:03.557
spills over to the NYPD,

02:03.591 --> 02:05.826
it'd be hard to call this
anything but a success.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.161
(taps mug on desk)

02:07.195 --> 02:08.896
(sighs)

02:08.929 --> 02:11.399
As much as you hate
to admit it, you know I'm right.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.534
Well, what are we waiting for?

02:13.567 --> 02:16.537
Your happy face?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.174
Close enough.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.311
(vehicles bustling)

02:23.344 --> 02:25.346
(crowd chatter)

02:29.250 --> 02:32.386
Hurry up! Do not

02:32.420 --> 02:34.822
get my goods
on the floor!

02:34.855 --> 02:37.225
Hurry... up!

02:41.362 --> 02:42.330
I done told you.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.465
I'm sorry.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.567
You better not

02:46.600 --> 02:47.935
be stalling me, man.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.970
That's all there is.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.439
You holding out
on me, old man?

02:51.472 --> 02:51.939
No.
Huh?

02:51.972 --> 02:53.441
(grunts)

02:53.474 --> 02:54.408
Take it easy, man.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.609
That really necessary?

02:55.643 --> 02:56.810
Man, shut your ass up.

02:57.978 --> 03:01.482
I ain't playing
with you, old man.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.885
Get over there.
Open it. The good Oxy.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.754
Open it!

03:06.787 --> 03:07.788
Now!

03:07.821 --> 03:10.491
Better stop messing
around. I'm tired of this.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.794
No. Don't!

03:15.996 --> 03:16.830
Oh!

03:16.864 --> 03:17.831
Stop, man!

03:17.865 --> 03:19.433
Don't! Be cool.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.934
(gunshot, screams)

03:20.968 --> 03:21.969
Oh, my God!

03:22.002 --> 03:23.437
(yelling)
No, no!

03:23.471 --> 03:24.605
Yo, what happened?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.840
I'm good. We got to go.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.008
(man whimpers)

03:28.041 --> 03:29.710
We got to go now!

03:58.306 --> 04:00.608
Second pharmacy hit in this
neighborhood in as many weeks.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.842
Only this time,
they came out shooting.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.412
Unbelievable. Guy comes in for
some Band-Aids for his kid,

04:04.445 --> 04:06.880
and he gets a gut full
of lead for his trouble.

04:06.914 --> 04:07.815
Any word on his condition?

04:07.848 --> 04:09.883
Ah, he was unconscious
when the bus arrived.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.852
They were rushing him straight
to surgery at St. Victor's.

04:11.885 --> 04:12.920
And we're thinking this
might have been an accident?

04:12.953 --> 04:14.021
Couple of witnesses
outside said

04:14.054 --> 04:16.724
that the shooter seemed like
the nice guy of the bunch.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.592
Said it seemed like
the gun just went off.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.461
Anyone get a look
at this Mr. Nice Guy?

04:20.494 --> 04:21.762
Uh, this is Miss De la Cruz.

04:21.795 --> 04:25.065
She was near the victim before
he tried to disarm the shooter.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.734
She didn't get a look
at the shooter's face,

04:26.767 --> 04:28.602
but she did get a
look at the gun.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.705
He kept sweeping it past
my face, over and over again.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.474
I'm sorry
you had to go through that.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.510
His gun--
it was a Colt .45 automatic.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.646
That's pretty specific.
My father has one.

04:38.679 --> 04:39.713
He taught me
to shoot on it.
Really?

04:39.747 --> 04:41.549
He didn't want me
to be like one of those girls

04:41.582 --> 04:43.351
in the movies, don't know
how to hold it right

04:43.384 --> 04:44.284
in case I ever needed to.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.520
Smart man.
Do you remember anything else?

04:46.554 --> 04:48.522
The grip. It wasn't black
like usual.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.624
More white
with a pearl-like finish.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.593
I guess you did get a good look.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.628
Yeah, someone holds a gun
to your face that long...

04:54.662 --> 04:56.029
I don't know
that I'll ever forget it.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.531
I understand.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.533
Let's get a Finest
out on these grips,

04:59.567 --> 05:01.535
and let's track these
three amigos down soon

05:01.569 --> 05:04.004
before they start leaving
more shells than pills around.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.039
(crowd cheering, applauding
and murmuring)

05:07.441 --> 05:09.710
POOLE:
New York, our message is clear.

05:09.743 --> 05:14.915
You give us your guns,
and we will give you 200 bucks,

05:14.948 --> 05:16.550
no questions asked.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.786
Now, last month, Mayor Poole
and Commissioner Reagan

05:18.819 --> 05:22.456
got 200 illegal guns
off of our streets...

05:22.490 --> 05:24.558
Listen, we think we can do
a lot better than that today.

05:24.592 --> 05:27.695
No, I know we can do better.
Now, what do you say?

05:27.728 --> 05:29.530
(cheering and applause)

05:29.563 --> 05:33.634
Now, now, now, now,
come on, friends.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.703
You're making me look bad
up here.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.905
Now, I promised the mayor
and Commissioner Reagan

05:37.938 --> 05:40.474
that we would deliver.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.410
Now, one more time.
Are you ready?

05:42.443 --> 05:43.677
(applause and cheering)

05:43.711 --> 05:46.046
I can't hear you.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.882
(louder applause and cheering)

05:48.916 --> 05:50.751
That's what
I'm talking about!

05:50.784 --> 05:53.053
(applause, cheering
and whistling)

05:54.788 --> 05:56.790
New beard, same old act.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.627
GARRETT:
Well, it's not like we
didn't see this coming.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.396
We know how Potter loves
the sound of his own voice.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.031
To put it mildly.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.799
I will not go down there.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.601
You don't have to.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.637
No, I don't, do I?

06:09.670 --> 06:11.104
Oh, no.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.239
Guy holds his own
press conference,

06:12.272 --> 06:15.476
somebody's got to go,
and it's not gonna be me. Baker?

06:15.509 --> 06:16.877
I have a luncheon.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.612
Yankee Legends
are gonna be there.

06:18.646 --> 06:19.647
I see.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.881
Yes, sir.
Baker,

06:20.914 --> 06:22.750
could you call the Yankees
and tell them

06:22.783 --> 06:24.485
DCPI Moore is going
to have to take

06:24.518 --> 06:25.686
a rain check today?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.655
Yes, sir.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.823
You'll keep me posted?

06:31.592 --> 06:33.661
I'll live-blog
for my Twitter feed.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.830
(sighs)

06:41.201 --> 06:43.103
Hey, Jack?
Yeah.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.439
Finest matches
on the grips go out yet?

06:45.473 --> 06:47.207
Yeah. Every cop in
the city's looking out

06:47.240 --> 06:50.644
for a .45 automatic with pearl
grips, but there's nothing yet.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.646
Oh. How about the customer
that got shot?

06:52.680 --> 06:54.582
He's alive, but
the report from

06:54.615 --> 06:56.450
Ballistics just came back
on the bullet.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.985
There's no link
to any other shootings.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.653
When can we talk to him?

06:59.687 --> 07:02.055
Well, Doctor's gonna call me
as soon as he comes to.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.657
All right. Well,
my CI's got squat

07:03.691 --> 07:05.626
as far as these robberies
being gang-related,

07:05.659 --> 07:07.695
so it looks like this
crew's unaffiliated.

07:07.728 --> 07:11.799
You know, I was thinking, if
those witnesses were right,

07:11.832 --> 07:14.668
and the shooter did show some
heart when his gun went off,

07:14.702 --> 07:17.805
then it's only a matter of time
before he gives up his buddies.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.474
You think?
Oh, you never know.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.477
You know, there's a reason
that's a lottery slogan.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.678
(sighs)

07:24.712 --> 07:26.179
Who you calling?

07:26.213 --> 07:29.082
I got this guy who used
to customize guns for lowlifes.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.685
I'm thinking, pearl grips
can't be too popular a choice.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.153
That's true.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.192
Hey, guys.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.861
Hey. Beware

07:40.894 --> 07:43.731
the gluten-free meatloaf.

07:43.764 --> 07:44.932
So, what's your point?

07:44.965 --> 07:46.867
I'm not saying I want you to go
all Sweet Valley High on me.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.836
But I should ixnay
the Pride and Prejudice?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.037
At least until
we get through Homecoming.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.540
If we get through Homecoming.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.011
I don't know.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.614
I have a good feeling
about it this year.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.687
Diane...

08:07.988 --> 08:08.889
...what was that?

08:08.922 --> 08:10.123
What was what?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.725
You were flirting.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.226
Well, trying to anyway.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.263
(whispers):
With Carlos?

08:17.130 --> 08:18.632
I thought he was still with Amy.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.871
All's fair in love and war.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.073
You're terrible.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.142
(cell phones buzzing
and chiming)

08:29.176 --> 08:31.645
(laughter)

08:40.120 --> 08:42.122
Oh, my God.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.124
This...

08:44.157 --> 08:46.126
This isn't happening.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.831
(laughter)

08:54.301 --> 08:56.303
(laughter)

09:08.616 --> 09:09.783
What a skank.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.621
Did you take one of these,
too, Reagan?

09:19.827 --> 09:21.762
Diane, wait!

09:21.795 --> 09:24.031
Always the quiet ones.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.602
GIRL:
See you later.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.970
Bye, skank.

09:32.706 --> 09:33.641
POTTER:
Veronica, thank you.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.842
Next time, bring some

09:34.875 --> 09:36.844
of your world-famous cookies
for me, okay?

09:36.877 --> 09:39.747
Will do, Reverend.
See you later.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.315
Luis, thank you very much
for coming.
Ah, good to see you.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.317
I appreciate your support.
All right.
Yeah, always.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.787
(laughs)

09:48.355 --> 09:49.690
Mr. Deputy Commissioner.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.358
I didn't know
we were expecting you.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.661
And I didn't know you were
holding a press conference.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.362
Well, as Deputy Commissioner
of Public Information,

09:55.395 --> 09:57.965
I'd think you'd know better
than anyone,

09:57.998 --> 10:00.333
if you're not using the media,
they're using you.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.802
Anyone else you're using,
Reverend?

10:01.835 --> 10:03.336
Have I crossed the line?

10:03.370 --> 10:05.272
I thought we were partners.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.339
I think I delivered.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.709
You're here on our dime,
not the other way around.

10:08.742 --> 10:09.977
But you already knew that,

10:10.010 --> 10:11.344
which is why
we didn't get the heads up.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.714
So you're here
to keep an eye on me,

10:13.747 --> 10:15.949
be my baby-sitter?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.217
Do you need to use the potty?

10:17.250 --> 10:20.854
(laughs)

10:23.356 --> 10:24.692
Next.

10:38.105 --> 10:41.675
Glock 19. Nine millimeter.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.643
Six rounds.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.447
Operable.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.918
Okay, sir, she'll give you
your $200 bank card. Next!

11:00.093 --> 11:03.163
Colt .45 automatic.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.398
It's a beautiful piece.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.967
Pearl grips.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.236
You don't see that
a lot these days.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.071
If you say so.
My money?

11:11.104 --> 11:12.740
Yeah, yeah,
just give me a second.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.110
(quietly):
You got that Finest message?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.849
Pearl grips.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.717
Is there a problem?

11:23.751 --> 11:25.853
No, no. I'll be right with you.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.356
Oh...

11:29.389 --> 11:30.991
Hey, hey, Ma.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.726
No, I'm good.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.194
Look, can I call you right back?

11:34.227 --> 11:36.063
I'm just...
Am I getting my
money or not?

11:36.096 --> 11:38.431
Yeah, I really,
really have to go, Mom.

11:40.868 --> 11:41.935
(quietly):
Okay.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.070
Gun's operable.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.739
All righty, here you go.

11:45.773 --> 11:46.774
She has your money.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.809
Sorry for holding you up.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.413
POTTER:
Officer?

11:53.446 --> 11:55.115
Reverend.

11:55.148 --> 11:58.018
Look, it's such a good thing
you're doing out here today.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.486
On behalf of the
NYPD, we wanted to...

11:59.519 --> 12:01.254
May I see your phone, Officer?

12:01.288 --> 12:02.956
I'm sorry?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.792
Now, Officer.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.059
I-I... Excuse me.
Hello.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.527
Everything okay here?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.296
Yeah, he's trying
to take my phone.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.397
Do you need a time-out,
Reverend?

12:10.430 --> 12:12.766
"No questions asked,"

12:12.800 --> 12:14.968
and she's here trying to take
pictures of these good people.

12:15.002 --> 12:15.803
Sir...

12:15.836 --> 12:17.470
Let me see it.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.748
There are no pictures here,
Reverend.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.389
Thank you, Officer.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.835
(beeps)

12:47.868 --> 12:49.769
Next.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.507
DANNY: You know, as much
as I don't like the guy,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.276
you shouldn't have lied
to Reverend Potter.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.178
When I gave him the phone,
there was no picture

12:58.211 --> 13:01.114
'cause I put it in my trash bin.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.118
So, you lied to Deputy
Commissioner Moore as well.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.288
Oh, great,
is there anyone else you'd like

13:08.321 --> 13:09.923
to invite
to your disciplinary hearing?
Look, Detective,

13:09.957 --> 13:12.826
I know what I did was wrong,
technically.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.962
Technically?
Come on, I got a guy
handing in a gun

13:14.995 --> 13:16.229
that was just used
in a shooting.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.232
How do I look the other way on
that and still wear the uniform?

13:19.266 --> 13:20.200
Sometimes wearing the uniform

13:20.233 --> 13:22.269
means you have
to look the other way, okay?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.236
It's "no questions asked."

13:23.270 --> 13:25.438
That is the rule
on the gun buyback program.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.573
I'm a cop.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.008
My job is to enforce the law,

13:28.041 --> 13:29.576
not the rules.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.812
And all due respect, Detective,
I didn't ask any questions.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.549
Go back to your precinct.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.586
And not a word
about this to anyone.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.990
Are you gonna use it?

13:43.023 --> 13:44.457
Get back to your patrol.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.561
You're starting to sound
a little bit like your father.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.098
Give me a break.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.268
All right, are we gonna use it?

14:08.916 --> 14:10.050
Hey.
Hey.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.985
I got the leads
from my gun guy.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.955
One of these names probably
belongs to those pearl grips.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.223
Okay, and?

14:16.256 --> 14:18.225
And what?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.030
Forget it;
we're not using the picture.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.331
We can. You just won't.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.432
Yeah, because it's wrong.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.034
It's kind of wrong.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.269
Okay, well, I'll remind myself
to use that one

14:29.302 --> 14:30.938
when we get ourselves
kind of jammed up.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.040
Look, she took the picture--
that was wrong;

14:33.073 --> 14:35.008
we agree on that--
but it's done already.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.044
You can't put
the genie back in the bottle.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.611
No, but we don't
have to go asking

14:38.645 --> 14:40.213
the genie for three
wishes either.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.950
Did I miss something
around here?

14:42.983 --> 14:44.985
Since when did we start
following the rules?

14:45.018 --> 14:46.519
Jack, this is different.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.121
All right, it's the mayor

14:48.155 --> 14:49.990
and my old man

14:50.023 --> 14:51.324
and the Reverend Potter.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.559
It's just...

14:52.592 --> 14:54.627
It's political, all right?

14:54.661 --> 14:57.064
Just forget about it.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.999
(phone rings)

15:00.000 --> 15:01.969
Reagan.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.437
All right, great.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.206
I'm on my way.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.141
Look, our victim's awake.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.977
Why don't you see
if you can get

15:10.010 --> 15:11.011
any traction on those leads.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.245
I'll get started
with the victim.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.047
Meet me at the hospital.
Yeah.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.183
And forget
about using the picture.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.988
Frank, we got 500
guns off the street,

15:21.021 --> 15:24.057
we made a friend out of
an enemy, and for once,

15:24.091 --> 15:26.093
we might even get some good ink.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.995
You sound like
you're selling tickets.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.196
It's a win, Frank.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.098
We should just take
the W and move on.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.268
When are you going to tell me
about the problem?

15:35.302 --> 15:36.970
There was no problem.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.371
Really?

15:38.405 --> 15:40.073
It was nothing.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.343
Just Potter being Potter.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.578
He had a few words
with one of our cops.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.379
Really?

15:46.413 --> 15:48.115
He claimed she was
taking pictures

15:48.148 --> 15:49.649
of the people donating guns.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.552
Said she was violating our
"no questions asked" policy.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.021
Really?

15:54.054 --> 15:55.055
As you might expect,

15:55.088 --> 15:57.991
he was long on accusations,
short on evidence.

15:58.025 --> 16:01.428
(sighs)
Is he going to leave it alone?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.330
Hard to say.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.466
I want to talk to the officer.

16:06.499 --> 16:09.302
Frank, it's done.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.271
Really?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.173
DANNY:
Just think back to the robbery

16:13.206 --> 16:14.407
at the drugstore, okay,
Mr. Cunningham?

16:14.441 --> 16:18.211
You gotta keep trying so we
can find the guy who shot you.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.114
All right, look,

16:21.148 --> 16:22.649
Jimmy explained
this to you, right?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.684
We're not looking
for a positive ID

16:24.717 --> 16:25.718
on any of these photos.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.155
We're just looking for
similar features, okay?

16:28.188 --> 16:30.490
You see something that
resembles the guy--

16:30.523 --> 16:31.758
the eyes, the nose--

16:31.791 --> 16:33.193
Jimmy puts it
into the sketch.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.461
Can you just try
a little more?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.496
Yeah.
All right.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.631
I got it.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.736
I don't know.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.772
I really don't.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.142
Just keep going;
I'll be right back.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.212
This guy is pretty weak, Jack.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.480
I don't think he's gonna help.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.382
How about the pearl grip?
Nada.

16:55.415 --> 16:58.151
Pearl-gripped hardware
is not as rare as you'd hoped.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.220
Oh.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.354
But, um...

17:01.388 --> 17:03.190
I did run ballistics on it.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.524
On the pearl-gripped gun?

17:04.557 --> 17:05.658
Mm-hmm.
Please tell me you did not

17:05.692 --> 17:08.328
run ballistics on a gun that
we are not supposed to have.

17:08.361 --> 17:12.799
I did not run ballistics on a
gun we're not supposed to have.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.668
(sighs) All right,
I'm not asking,

17:15.702 --> 17:17.670
but if I was,
what does it say?

17:17.704 --> 17:18.938
It's a match.

17:18.971 --> 17:22.209
The gun that Perez intercepted
at the buyback is the same one

17:22.242 --> 17:24.177
that put this guy in
the bed; are you sure?
Yes.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.279
And the guy in that picture
could be the shooter, Danny.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.280
But he'd have to be crazy.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.581
What do you mean,
someone's gonna use a gun

17:28.615 --> 17:31.284
in a shooting and turn around
and hand it over to the police?

17:31.318 --> 17:32.785
How many smart shooters
have you met?

17:33.786 --> 17:35.322
(sighs)

17:37.324 --> 17:39.259
So, start from the eyes,

17:39.292 --> 17:41.428
and just move down
to the slope of the nose.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.296
Does anything
look familiar at all?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.165
I...

17:45.198 --> 17:47.300
I'm-I'm not sure.

17:47.334 --> 17:50.370
Did he have a wide nose,

17:50.403 --> 17:52.139
maybe a high bridge?

17:52.172 --> 17:55.308
CUNNINGHAM:
As I recall,
I'd say it was wide.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.276
JIMMY:
Wide.

17:56.309 --> 17:59.312
Any distinguishing features

17:59.346 --> 18:01.414
around the nose?

18:01.448 --> 18:04.217
Not that I can think of.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.253
Let me see those
photos, okay?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.690
(sighing):
Okay.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.193
Working on the bridge
of the nose, right?

18:13.226 --> 18:15.728
All right.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.730
Okay.

18:17.764 --> 18:21.134
Either of these two guys,

18:21.168 --> 18:22.735
they resemble your guy?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.837
Um, I think so.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.307
This one, all right. Okay.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.909
What's next?

18:29.942 --> 18:30.877
Uh, the mouth.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.845
The mouth, all right.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.349
This guy's mouth
look similar at all to you?

18:36.383 --> 18:38.218
Yeah, it does.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.819
Okay, there you go.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.388
Put that in there, all right?

18:49.629 --> 18:53.233
Sir, you think you could, uh,
just look at this picture?

18:53.266 --> 18:55.268
Just need a moment
of your... right.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.470
Ma'am, you want to take
a look at this?

18:57.504 --> 18:59.806
Uh, you know him, or maybe seen
him in the neighborhood...

18:59.839 --> 19:01.341
Hey, hold on, hold on.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.942
Look, these guys are
robbing pharmacies...

19:02.975 --> 19:04.277
Yo no se nada.
Come on!

19:04.311 --> 19:05.378
Sal de aqui. Vete!

19:05.412 --> 19:07.180
Hey, you seen this guy?

19:07.214 --> 19:08.881
Come on,
you help me find a bad guy,

19:08.915 --> 19:10.917
you can keep ignoring me
like you're doing right now.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.252
Reagan.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.920
Oh, yeah, that one;
I know this guy.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.255
Says he knows this guy.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.155
Yeah, I know this guy.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.657
Yeah, we can't talk
over here, though.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.891
Let's go inside.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.860
Okay.

19:23.396 --> 19:27.367
NICKY:
Hey, it's-it's me again.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.503
Look, Diane, I don't blame you
for not wanting to talk to me.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.405
I should've stuck up for you.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.707
And I am so sorry.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.309
Call me.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.279
Please.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.381
Everything cool?

19:41.414 --> 19:44.384
Yeah, just calling a friend
about homework.

19:48.388 --> 19:51.291
A friend at school's
just going through some stuff.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.860
I may not be a detective yet,

19:53.893 --> 19:55.662
but I was a teenager.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.432
Promise you won't tell Mom?

19:59.466 --> 20:01.434
She'd go all D.A. on me.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.970
Yeah.

20:04.003 --> 20:08.207
Haven't you ever heard
of the blue wall of silence?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.644
(sighs)

20:11.678 --> 20:13.546
Someone got their hands
on my friend's selfy

20:13.580 --> 20:15.282
and spammed it
to everyone in the school.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.617
Okay, one more time
in English. A selfy?

20:17.650 --> 20:20.453
It's a sexy picture
you take of yourself.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.623
Oh, okay.

20:25.692 --> 20:29.329
I see what
you mean.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.731
The whole school turned on her

20:31.764 --> 20:35.468
and I just... sat there...

20:35.502 --> 20:38.371
frozen.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.376
I should have said something.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.912
I should have done something.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.918
Do you want to know what
your grandfather would say?

20:51.951 --> 20:54.587
That he's disappointed?

20:54.621 --> 20:58.458
That a Reagan doesn't do that?

20:58.491 --> 21:01.294
He'd say it's what
you do next that counts.

21:08.768 --> 21:12.505
For my fifth birthday, my mother
bought me Princess slippers.

21:12.539 --> 21:15.475
I cut off the toes,
turned them into holsters.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.310
You love the job.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.779
A little too much if you're
listening to my mother.

21:19.812 --> 21:23.350
Top ten
in your graduating class.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.685
Two years on the job,

21:25.718 --> 21:28.321
and already several
commendations.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.457
Do you know
why I asked to see you?

21:30.490 --> 21:32.359
Not really, sir, no.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.662
Well, I understand
you had a run-in

21:35.695 --> 21:37.630
with Reverend Potter yesterday.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.898
That was nothing, sir.

21:38.931 --> 21:39.932
A small misunderstanding.

21:39.966 --> 21:44.103
Well, small or not, still,
we wanted to thank you.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.539
Thank me?
The reverend means well,

21:46.573 --> 21:49.776
but like many of us,
sometimes his lesser qualities

21:49.809 --> 21:51.778
overshadow his greater ones.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.980
We wanted to thank you
for treating him with respect

21:54.013 --> 21:58.451
in the face of some pretty
insulting accusations.

22:03.122 --> 22:05.425
Reverend Potter's charge
wasn't without merit, was it?

22:07.427 --> 22:10.397
At roll call, the sergeant
read out a Finest message.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.732
Pearl handle
on a Colt automatic.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.902
I'm not at my post 20 minutes
when what comes walking in.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.470
Colt with a pearl handle.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.839
I got a bad guy standing
right there in front of me.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.475
Every cell in my body is
screaming I got to do something.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.612
But the reason it's not
on the phone when I check it?

22:25.645 --> 22:28.815
I deleted it while you
and the reverend were talking.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.584
But it was still
in your trash bin.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.556
Commissioner, I am so sorry.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.629
(sighs)

22:44.564 --> 22:47.400
Think this bodega owner
gave us the wrong address?

22:47.434 --> 22:49.068
Maybe.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.637
We'll give it a
little longer.

22:50.670 --> 22:51.971
Yeah.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.506
(groans softly)

22:55.608 --> 22:57.977
Look like our guy
over there?

22:58.010 --> 23:00.947
Looks like him to me.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.082
Let's go see.
(clears throat)

23:04.116 --> 23:06.653
Benjamin Banks.

23:08.588 --> 23:09.522
Oh! Oh!

23:09.556 --> 23:11.691
Oh! Oh! Oh!
(horn honks,
tires squealing)

23:11.724 --> 23:13.860
Whoa!
Hey, hold up!

23:14.561 --> 23:15.428
Come here!

23:15.462 --> 23:17.029
Whoa! (groans)

23:17.063 --> 23:18.731
Come here.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.600
Get on your feet.
Turn around.

23:20.633 --> 23:21.868
Put your hands
against the vehicle.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.636
Look...
Spread your legs!

23:23.670 --> 23:25.204
You know, if you
pull your pants up

23:25.237 --> 23:26.539
next time, you
might get away.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.741
What the hell
did I do?
I don't know.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.910
I got a guy
with a belly full of led

23:30.943 --> 23:32.645
who thinks you fed it to him.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.213
What do you
think, Jack?
Twins.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.648
I agree.
Let's go.
No, man.

23:35.682 --> 23:38.117
Shut up.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.828
(sighs)

23:50.229 --> 23:52.732
So, what did I do?

23:55.001 --> 23:56.936
Who says you did anything?

23:56.969 --> 23:58.538
I don't know.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.773
Jamie you have a drink with,
you want to unwind.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.174
Erin, you want
to give advice.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.910
You want to throw one
back with me,

24:03.943 --> 24:05.912
it's usually 'cause
I screwed something up.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.948
Heard you like a guy for
the pharmacy shooting.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.752
Yeah, we like him pretty good.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.854
How did you get to him?

24:14.887 --> 24:16.222
Bodega owner recognized him

24:16.255 --> 24:18.525
from a sketch we got
from a eyewitness.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.059
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.227
That's good police work.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.462
Thank you.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.767
This your guy?

24:30.570 --> 24:33.005
(sighs)

24:33.039 --> 24:35.908
Did you use it?

24:35.942 --> 24:37.243
Officer Perez came to me.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.945
She showed me the photo.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.913
I sent her packing,
I crumpled it up.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.782
Did you use it?

24:42.815 --> 24:44.951
Not exactly.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.152
(sighs)

24:46.185 --> 24:47.386
Not exactly.

24:47.419 --> 24:50.156
The witness was having trouble
getting the sketch going right.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.791
I made a few suggestions.

24:51.824 --> 24:55.027
So you not only blew off our
No Questions Asked policy.

24:55.061 --> 24:57.263
You coached a witness
into making an ID.

24:57.296 --> 25:00.600
I made a suggestion, I gave him
a nudge in the right direction.

25:00.633 --> 25:01.601
Have you booked him?

25:01.634 --> 25:02.869
We're holding him.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.037
He walks.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.810
That... If I got
to bend the rules a little bit

25:10.843 --> 25:12.712
to get a bad guy off the street,

25:12.745 --> 25:14.213
I'm gonna do it,
and you would, too.

25:14.246 --> 25:17.750
The hell I would.
The hell you didn't.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.094
(sighs)

25:35.935 --> 25:39.606
All right,
kid, get lost.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.840
What?

25:40.873 --> 25:42.575
We're cutting
you loose.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.611
Here's your hat.
What's your hurry?

25:44.644 --> 25:45.845
Hey, why-why
you letting me go?

25:45.878 --> 25:48.615
Look, would you just beat it
before I fall down on your fist?

25:48.648 --> 25:50.249
Assaulting an officer will keep
you here another eight hours.

25:50.282 --> 25:51.884
I'm going.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.753
And pull up your pants.
Hey, what's
going on, Reagan?

25:53.786 --> 25:55.888
I leave for a couple of hours,
you letting the prisoners go?

25:55.922 --> 25:57.590
Oh, Jack,
you remember I told you

25:57.624 --> 25:58.925
we were gonna get jammed up?

25:58.958 --> 26:00.960
Guess what. We got jammed up.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.062
I am sorry, Danny.

26:03.095 --> 26:06.032
We'll live. How'd it go
at the hospital?
Worse.

26:06.065 --> 26:09.201
I spent the last hour doing
a photo array with the victim.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.336
Mm-hmm.
He saw Banks's picture

26:10.369 --> 26:11.604
ten different ways.

26:11.638 --> 26:12.739
Didn't pick 'em once.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.040
Great.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.241
So he's not even our guy.

26:16.275 --> 26:17.744
Let's pull the fives

26:17.777 --> 26:19.145
on the other witnesses,
all right?

26:19.178 --> 26:21.013
I'm gonna read
their statements again.

26:21.047 --> 26:21.714
Wait. What are we doing?

26:21.748 --> 26:23.349
We're gonna start from scratch.

26:23.382 --> 26:26.285
Mm-hmm.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.689
(school bell ringing)

26:33.292 --> 26:35.261
Diane?

26:35.294 --> 26:37.764
Diane, wait!

26:37.797 --> 26:39.398
Guess I'm not a
social leper anymore?

26:39.431 --> 26:41.200
Diane, I'm sorry.

26:41.233 --> 26:43.302
Now. Practically let 'em
pin a scarlet letter

26:43.335 --> 26:44.971
on me the other day.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.707
Look, you have every right
to be mad at me-- I was wrong--

26:47.740 --> 26:49.976
but I'd really like
to make it up to you.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.343
How? Do you have
a time machine?

26:51.377 --> 26:53.913
No, I got something
way better than that.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.915
An uncle with a hook in TARU.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.149
You think I need to move
to another country.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.317
This is worse than I thought.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.786
TARU's not a country.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.353
It's a division of the NYPD.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.690
Tactical Assistance
Response Unit.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.257
What are you talking about,
Nicky?

27:05.291 --> 27:06.425
My Uncle Jamie's looking into

27:06.458 --> 27:08.027
who spammed that text
to everyone.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.329
What?!
He's going to find out
who did this to you.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.731
Oh, my God, Nicky. No!

27:11.764 --> 27:12.699
Diane, I...
Listen to me.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.934
If you really want to help,
just drop it.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.402
I just want to forget
that this ever happened.

27:29.015 --> 27:31.818
You know, Jack,

27:31.851 --> 27:34.754
one of my first cases.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.689
We like this bike messenger
for an assault

27:36.723 --> 27:38.257
coming off a, uh,
bar fight in Chelsea.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.059
It was nasty.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.360
The bartender caught
the business end

27:41.393 --> 27:43.062
of a longneck right
in the throat.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.463
He made it through, but

27:44.496 --> 27:46.866
the thing is,

27:46.899 --> 27:48.801
the detective
that I caught with was certain

27:48.835 --> 27:51.704
that the bad guy was gonna
come back and finish the job.

27:51.738 --> 27:54.006
So certain, he put a uniform
outside the bartender's walk-up.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.042
Sure enough, that night,
he hears a noise.

27:56.075 --> 27:59.145
He goes around the back,
he looks up in the fire escape,

27:59.178 --> 28:00.747
and he sees the bike messenger.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.048
It looks like he's got a piece.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.851
Just as the cop's
about to blast him,

28:04.884 --> 28:05.852
he realizes

28:05.885 --> 28:08.020
that the bike messenger
is not carrying a piece.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.922
It's actually a freaking rose.

28:09.956 --> 28:11.057
A rose?

28:11.090 --> 28:12.191
Yeah. It turns out,

28:12.224 --> 28:15.394
the bike messenger and
the bartender were boyfriends.

28:15.427 --> 28:17.296
They-they didn't have
a bar fight.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.732
They had a knock-down,
drag-out lovers' quarrel.

28:19.766 --> 28:22.001
All right, so,
that's a great story, but...

28:22.034 --> 28:23.970
I mean, what are you thinking?

28:24.003 --> 28:25.805
That the shooter is sleeping
with the victim?

28:25.838 --> 28:27.139
No, no, no. That's not...

28:27.173 --> 28:29.508
Look, each and every one
of these statements--

28:29.541 --> 28:31.811
all the witnesses
are saying the same thing.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.913
That the shooter was showing
compassion during the robbery,

28:33.946 --> 28:35.782
like he didn't want anybody
to get hurt.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.117
All right, so you think
he feels bad, you think

28:38.150 --> 28:41.087
maybe he goes by the hospital to
make sure the guy pulls through.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.823
Anything can happen, right?

28:43.856 --> 28:45.224
I'll get the hospital.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.060
(sighs)

28:49.561 --> 28:51.097
Jack, tell 'em to make sure

28:51.130 --> 28:53.332
they give us all
the surveillance video they got

28:53.365 --> 28:56.435
anywhere near the victim's
room, all right?
Yeah, yeah.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.107
Officer Perez.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.944
Commissioner.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.212
Officer Perez.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.546
As you were.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.915
I'll be brief.

29:08.948 --> 29:11.083
I know you're in the
middle of your tour,

29:11.117 --> 29:13.052
and Central's
holding jobs.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.486
When you return
to your precinct,

29:14.520 --> 29:17.056
your desk sergeant is
gonna give you a two-day rip.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.191
That's for violating
department policy.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.027
Yes, sir.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.896
You're losing your seat
in the car for a few tours.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.965
You'll be walking a foot post.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.534
And you might want to drop
by Reverend Potter's church.

29:28.567 --> 29:31.470
He's always looking
for volunteers.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.939
Of course, sir.

29:32.972 --> 29:35.274
Officer Perez,
what you did was wrong.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.578
But the instincts that drove you
to do what you did--

29:39.611 --> 29:42.381
well...

29:42.414 --> 29:45.784
I'd ride with you
in a radio car any day.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.291
That is all.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.126
Thank you, sir.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.366
Volunteer
at Potter's church?

30:00.399 --> 30:04.236
Please tell me that doesn't mean
you're going to tell Potter?

30:04.270 --> 30:06.272
(sighs)

30:07.439 --> 30:09.441
Well, Garrett...

30:11.610 --> 30:13.913
...the truth will set you free.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.857
(hydraulic brakes hissing)

30:30.162 --> 30:32.064
Hey, Nicky.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.133
Nick!
Uncle Jamie?

30:34.166 --> 30:35.167
Hey.

30:35.201 --> 30:38.370
Hey.

30:38.404 --> 30:42.174
For the record, this counts
as your birthday present.

30:42.208 --> 30:45.277
Thank you so much, but...

30:45.311 --> 30:47.146
I'm sorry you went
to all that trouble.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.948
What's going on, Nick?

30:48.981 --> 30:50.516
Diane doesn't want my help.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.318
Not that I can blame her,

30:52.351 --> 30:54.987
considering what a good friend
I was the other day.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.023
I don't think that's it.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.425
She doesn't want your help

30:59.458 --> 31:01.560
because she doesn't want
you to know the truth.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.265
Diane sent that picture
to everyone herself.

31:06.298 --> 31:10.402
What?!
I know, it doesn't make
any sense, but she did.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.976
Actually, it makes more sense
than you would think.

31:19.011 --> 31:21.247
It's really annoying sometimes.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.049
At home, our parents refuse

31:23.082 --> 31:25.151
to accept the fact
that we're growing up.

31:25.184 --> 31:28.420
They try and keep us frozen
in time as little kids.

31:28.454 --> 31:31.190
But here at school,
it's even worse.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.391
I mean, if you...

31:32.424 --> 31:34.994
If you're not willing to grow up
faster than everyone else,

31:35.027 --> 31:36.695
it's like you don't even exist,
like you're invisible.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.331
She sent that picture
to get noticed.

31:40.332 --> 31:43.269
It shouldn't be this hard.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.304
No, it shouldn't.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.340
(sighs)

31:49.541 --> 31:51.377
All right, how we doing
with the transfer

31:51.410 --> 31:52.478
on the hospital
surveillance video?

31:52.511 --> 31:54.546
It looks good. You know,
facial recognition software

31:54.580 --> 31:56.182
is actually quite simple really.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.450
Well, can you make
it really simple?
Danny, he's still

31:58.484 --> 32:01.253
trying to figure out how to text
with those little smiley faces.

32:01.287 --> 32:04.690
I simply freeze on a good angle
of the suspect. There we go.

32:04.723 --> 32:07.459
There's our guy.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.461
Look at him. He
just couldn't resist

32:09.495 --> 32:11.663
asking the nurse how
the victim was doing.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.065
Now, the computer will analyze

32:13.099 --> 32:14.333
the details
of the subject's face

32:14.366 --> 32:15.734
while simultaneously
cross-referencing

32:15.767 --> 32:17.469
those same characteristics

32:17.503 --> 32:19.338
with anyone else we already have
in the database.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.307
(computer trilling)

32:21.340 --> 32:23.309
Oh, we lock up

32:23.342 --> 32:25.344
a lot of people.
(sighs)
It's gonna

32:25.377 --> 32:27.079
take a while. We should probably
go to lunch first.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.014
(beep)
Done.

32:28.047 --> 32:28.680
What?

32:28.714 --> 32:30.582
There he is.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.351
There's your guy.

32:32.384 --> 32:33.252
"Terrence Banks."
Banks.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.387
That's the same last
name as our collar.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.423
Hold on.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.361
They're brothers.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.396
Let's go.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.549
This guy maxes out
just three weeks ago

33:03.582 --> 33:04.683
on a grand larceny conviction.

33:04.716 --> 33:05.684
Yeah,

33:05.717 --> 33:08.387
and he's already trying
to earn his way back in.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.456
Must have missed his friends
on the inside.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.395
(TV playing loudly inside)

33:16.428 --> 33:17.529
Those cries of distress?

33:17.563 --> 33:19.265
Or maybe
a bad telenovela.

33:19.298 --> 33:20.266
Let's go with yours.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.069
I like that idea.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.336
(door blasts open)
BENJAMIN: Whoa, whoa!

33:24.370 --> 33:26.205
What the hell, man?
Where's your brother?

33:26.238 --> 33:28.474
W-What do you want him for?
Terrence isn't...
Where is he?!

33:28.507 --> 33:30.309
What, what?
N-No, look, he's not...

33:30.342 --> 33:31.743
I'm on it, Jack.

33:31.777 --> 33:32.778
Oh! Sit down.

33:32.811 --> 33:33.779
Down!

33:33.812 --> 33:35.214
Terrence!

33:35.714 --> 33:36.615
Hey!

33:41.253 --> 33:42.488
Hold it!

33:46.792 --> 33:48.694
What is wrong

33:48.727 --> 33:50.529
with you Banks
brothers, huh?

33:50.562 --> 33:51.530
You guys love to run, don't you?

33:51.563 --> 33:52.531
I didn't...

33:52.564 --> 33:53.532
You didn't what?!

33:53.565 --> 33:55.467
I didn't mean to shoot that guy.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.303
(handcuffs rasping)
It comes with the territory

33:57.336 --> 33:59.338
when you're robbing people
at gunpoint.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.340
Get on your feet.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.175
Come on. Come on.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.544
BENJAMIN:
Hey, hey, look, man,
it's not his fault.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.446
It's that crew
he runs with.
Right.

34:07.479 --> 34:08.747
Okay, look, they don't
give him any choice.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.182
Well, you know
what they say--

34:10.216 --> 34:11.617
you are
who your friends are.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.119
Okay, look,
what if he gives 'em up?

34:13.152 --> 34:14.353
Okay, would you cut him a deal?

34:14.386 --> 34:15.421
Let me ask you a question.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.389
Why'd you turn in
your brother's gun, Benjamin?

34:17.423 --> 34:19.658
Look, I found it in his room
while he was asleep, okay?

34:19.691 --> 34:21.427
I didn't know anything
about the shooting.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.628
I just wanted it
out of our place.

34:22.661 --> 34:23.829
I told you
to stay out of it.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.731
You spend your whole life
trying to cover for this kid?

34:25.764 --> 34:27.766
And this is the
thanks you get.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.501
Look, he's my brother.
DANNY:
Yeah,

34:29.535 --> 34:30.736
and you almost did
a bid for him.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.338
Now say good-bye.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.542
I'm sorry, Benny.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.477
Look, man, look,
d-d-don't worry.

34:38.510 --> 34:39.511
I'm gonna get you a lawyer.

34:39.545 --> 34:40.512
Don't say anything.

34:40.546 --> 34:41.680
Step away
from the car,

34:41.713 --> 34:43.182
Benjamin.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.583
(car door closes)

34:44.616 --> 34:46.452
(engine starts)

35:00.266 --> 35:02.234
You wanted to talk?

35:02.268 --> 35:04.570
Thanks for meeting me.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.871
My mom's waiting.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.839
Right.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.275
Well, I spoke
to my uncle.

35:09.308 --> 35:10.876
After I asked
you not to.

35:10.909 --> 35:12.544
Pathetic much?

35:12.578 --> 35:14.180
Junior college much?

35:15.814 --> 35:17.216
(scoffs)

35:18.217 --> 35:19.518
Long overdue.

35:19.551 --> 35:23.222
Anyway, I wanted to tell you
what my uncle found out.

35:23.255 --> 35:24.890
I know what he found out.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.158
I can explain.

35:26.192 --> 35:29.228
Whoever hacked into your phone
must have been a geek genius.

35:29.261 --> 35:32.164
They put up some kind of
firewall or something,

35:32.198 --> 35:33.432
I don't know.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.402
Anyway, I'm sorry,
but it's untraceable.

35:36.435 --> 35:38.136
Thank you.

35:39.671 --> 35:40.506
For what it's worth,

35:40.539 --> 35:42.741
I know that what I did
was so not normal.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.743
Diane, we're
in high school.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.712
There's no such
thing as normal.

35:48.647 --> 35:52.551
Besides, it's what you
do next that counts.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.820
Hang this weekend?

35:54.853 --> 35:55.854
Definitely.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.860
Knock, knock.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.762
Mom, what are you
doing here?

36:03.795 --> 36:04.763
Playing hooky.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.298
You want to join?

36:06.332 --> 36:07.666
What do you have
in mind?

36:07.699 --> 36:10.669
Shopping spree, mani-pedi?

36:10.702 --> 36:11.670
No?

36:11.703 --> 36:14.606
Anything you
would like to do?

36:14.640 --> 36:18.877
Well, if you promise
not to spaz out too much.

36:18.910 --> 36:22.681
How about just a cozy
movie night at home?

36:22.714 --> 36:24.683
I can handle that.

36:24.716 --> 36:25.884
Looked like
you were having

36:25.917 --> 36:28.287
a pretty serious
conversation with Diane.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.955
Mom.

36:29.988 --> 36:32.190
Okay, okay.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.864
Congratulations, Mr.
Mayor, every paper in town

36:38.897 --> 36:41.800
is touting the success of
the gun buyback program,

36:41.833 --> 36:45.604
but the real feather
in your cap comes

36:45.637 --> 36:47.973
from the Ledger.

36:48.006 --> 36:51.710
This is an advanced copy
of tomorrow's editorial.

36:51.743 --> 36:55.714
They cite your leadership
and steadfast support

36:55.747 --> 36:56.748
as the key
ingredients.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.384
Well, it's easy to be a stalwart

36:58.417 --> 37:00.419
when you feel so strongly
about the cause.

37:00.452 --> 37:03.389
Oh, they got it right this time,
Mr. Mayor.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.657
You put this
coalition together.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.559
You deserve
all the credit.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.728
Actually, Reverend,
they reserved

37:09.761 --> 37:12.531
their most lavish
praise for you.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.367
"F. Scott Fitzgerald
famously said

37:15.401 --> 37:17.869
"there are no second
acts in American lives.

37:17.903 --> 37:22.508
"Well, somebody forgot to
tell Reverend Darnell Potter.

37:22.541 --> 37:25.844
"Just months after
his fall from grace,

37:25.877 --> 37:26.945
"he proved
the best way

37:26.978 --> 37:29.281
"to right a wrong
is by doing good,

37:29.315 --> 37:33.685
"and what good he did:

37:33.719 --> 37:36.822
over 500 guns
off the street."

37:36.855 --> 37:38.757
Well done, Reverend.

37:38.790 --> 37:42.428
Thank you, Commissioner.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.895
Oh, this means a great deal.

37:45.331 --> 37:47.933
That is not to say
there wasn't a hiccup.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.470
Really, Frank, a hiccup?

37:51.503 --> 37:53.639
Reverend Potter,
this is confidential.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.073
I'm gonna have to
trust you with this.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.808
Mm-hmm.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.610
(sighs)

37:58.644 --> 38:00.479
One of the guns we
bought back was used

38:00.512 --> 38:03.449
in a robbery and a shooting
earlier that morning.

38:03.482 --> 38:06.017
If that gets out,
that could taint everything

38:06.051 --> 38:07.085
that we worked for.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.356
Yeah, I'm afraid
it could.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.890
I have everything here

38:11.923 --> 38:15.694
and I'll be happy to
share it with you.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.729
(sighs)

38:19.365 --> 38:22.334
Mr. Mayor, this is
a need-to-know file

38:22.368 --> 38:24.870
and New York Police business.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.805
Frankly,
you have no need to know,

38:26.838 --> 38:28.874
and I would like
to keep it that way

38:28.907 --> 38:31.810
in order for you to maintain

38:31.843 --> 38:34.780
plausible deniability.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.551
Well, Frank, you know
I've always trusted

38:39.585 --> 38:41.019
your judgment in these matters.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.489
If it is indeed need-to-know,
it's that way for a reason.

38:43.522 --> 38:46.658
Reverend?

38:46.692 --> 38:50.762
Well, like, my great-
grandmother used to say,

38:50.796 --> 38:52.998
only a fool goes looking
for a rainstorm in the sunshine.

38:53.031 --> 38:53.999
(laughs)

38:54.032 --> 38:56.134
Good.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.536
Very good.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.538
I'll say good night, then.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.810
Reverend Potter.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.445
Good night, Commissioner.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.547
Frank.
Mr. Mayor.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.689
Hey, hey, hey, you
wash your hands?

39:17.723 --> 39:18.690
Let me see.

39:18.724 --> 39:19.691
Yeah.
Yep.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.427
Let me see--
other side.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.629
Try again-- this time
don't be afraid of the soap.

39:23.662 --> 39:25.431
Okay.
Incoming.

39:25.464 --> 39:26.097
(chuckles)

39:26.131 --> 39:27.098
Hey, hey, hey.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.133
Come on, it's still

39:28.166 --> 39:29.100
my house, you know.
Might be,

39:29.134 --> 39:31.470
but it's my chicken.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.749
I know it
pisses you off,

39:43.782 --> 39:47.453
I don't do the job
the way you did it.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.487
You know what pisses me off?

39:48.520 --> 39:49.921
When I bust your chops
for doing

39:49.955 --> 39:53.058
the things you think
I used to do myself.

39:53.091 --> 39:56.027
Yeah.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.163
What makes you think that
I used to bend the rules?

39:58.196 --> 40:00.666
I work with
guys every day

40:00.699 --> 40:02.133
that you used to
work with, Dad.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.836
Oh.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.140
More often than not,
the end results

40:09.174 --> 40:12.110
of the things we do
wind up

40:12.143 --> 40:15.481
being more about luck
than skill.

40:15.514 --> 40:18.149
I was always lucky.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.985
That's how we're most alike.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.191
I just don't want
to see your luck run out.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.966
So I guess
you were looking out for me.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.137
No, I was being
the commissioner.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.573
ERIN:
You guys done?

40:41.607 --> 40:44.175
Dinner's ready.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.188
Okay, who wants to say grace?

40:57.222 --> 40:58.824
I said it last week.

40:58.857 --> 41:00.926
ERIN:
Don't even look at me.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.228
I always say it.

41:03.261 --> 41:04.162
Well, one of the boys
can say it.

41:04.195 --> 41:05.864
