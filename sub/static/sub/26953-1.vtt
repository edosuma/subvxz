03:24.833 --> 03:29.833
* Twinkle, twinkle little star

03:30.467 --> 03:32.800
* How I wonder

03:34.333 --> 03:39.033
- Preconceptions have
a direct relationship

03:39.033 --> 03:44.033
with the expectation and realization
of the concept of fear.

03:46.800 --> 03:51.133
At the moment the mind
converts mental fear

03:51.133 --> 03:53.867
process into physical symptoms,

03:55.133 --> 03:58.600
then the cycle is complete.

04:06.500 --> 04:10.800
The ultimate definition of fear.

04:12.767 --> 04:16.166
- Well, I've been working
on my dissertation,

04:16.166 --> 04:19.833
and I've decided to
change direction.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.533
- You're still focusing
on fear though, right?

04:21.533 --> 04:22.333
- Oh, yeah.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.833
But I've got a
completely new angle.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.200
- Okay, and what is it?

04:28.200 --> 04:29.700
- You cannot tell anybody.

04:29.700 --> 04:30.967
- Hey, come on.

04:33.933 --> 04:38.933
- Okay, I'm gonna make
a film on actual fear.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.033
- What like the
Omen or something?

04:43.067 --> 04:44.333
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

04:44.333 --> 04:45.167
- No.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.633
Like a video diary.

04:48.933 --> 04:52.600
Okay, imagine a
documentary based on how

04:52.600 --> 04:55.033
fear can be
manipulated, created.

04:56.667 --> 04:57.733
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

04:57.733 --> 04:59.367
- And how?

04:59.367 --> 05:00.933
- Okay, I'm taking
my girlfriends

05:00.933 --> 05:02.833
up to a cabin for the weekend.

05:02.833 --> 05:06.067
I'm gonna actually scare
them and secretly film it.

05:07.067 --> 05:09.200
- You serious?
- Oh, yeah.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.133
Professor French is gonna
love it I just know it.

05:12.133 --> 05:13.867
- How are you gonna
film it though?

05:15.300 --> 05:18.000
- I rigged the cabin with
hidden cameras and speakers.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.767
- Wow, sneaky.

05:20.767 --> 05:22.967
Okay, so where does the

05:22.967 --> 05:24.867
manipulation part
come into play then?

05:26.267 --> 05:28.000
- Okay, let me
show you something.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.067
What color is your shirt?

05:32.033 --> 05:34.167
- White.
- What color is this?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.300
- White.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.333
- Okay, and this?

05:37.333 --> 05:38.933
- White.
- What do cows drink?

05:39.933 --> 05:40.900
- Milk.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.533
- Do they?
- Yes.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.433
No, no, okay.

05:45.433 --> 05:46.367
Cows don't drink milk.

05:46.367 --> 05:47.533
They drink water you got me.

05:47.533 --> 05:49.600
- See.
- Okay, very clever.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.200
Do something else.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.000
- Are you good at math?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.233
- I'm okay.

05:55.233 --> 05:56.300
- Alright, I need
to borrow this.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.133
- Alright.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.233
- What's two times two?
- Four.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.900
- What's four times four?
- 16.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.333
- What's two times 16?
- 32.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.900
- Two times two?
- Four.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.300
- Four times four?
- 16.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.833
- Two times 16?
- 32.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.033
- Two times two?
- Four.

06:14.033 --> 06:15.000
- Name a vegetable?

06:16.033 --> 06:16.867
- Carrot.

06:19.000 --> 06:19.833
- Interesting.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.900
- Okay, what the hell.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.300
How did you know I
was gonna say that?

06:27.300 --> 06:31.233
- Did you really think
that or did I make you?

06:31.233 --> 06:32.600
- Okay, impressive.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.800
- Oh, my god I have to go.

06:33.800 --> 06:34.633
- Right.

06:35.833 --> 06:37.800
Good luck to you,
Mrs. Spielberg.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.367
- Shut up, Julian.

06:39.367 --> 06:41.533
- Alright, sorry.

06:41.533 --> 06:42.467
- Thanks for the coffee.

06:42.467 --> 06:44.000
- You're welcome for the coffee.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.900
- So how did you guys meet?

06:50.267 --> 06:52.800
- Me and Rachel knew
each other from New York.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.167
We were in the
same dorm together.

06:54.167 --> 06:56.067
- Yeah, and it was crazy.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.000
- Crazy.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.933
It was insane, oh my god.

06:59.933 --> 07:01.900
And, um.

07:01.900 --> 07:04.533
Frankie, how do we
know each other?

07:04.533 --> 07:06.467
- Oh, you know.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.733
- We used to work in a coffee
shop together one summer,

07:08.733 --> 07:10.233
and we've just been
friends ever since.

07:10.233 --> 07:11.267
- Oh, that's fun.

07:11.267 --> 07:13.267
- And you're a dance major?

07:13.267 --> 07:14.700
- Yeah, in my second year.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.267
- You enjoying it?
- I love it.

07:16.267 --> 07:19.033
I mean it's a lot
of work, long hours,

07:19.033 --> 07:21.833
so there's always something
going on but it's great.

07:21.833 --> 07:24.633
- Rachel can relate to that
she's a performer herself.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.500
- Yeah, but you should
really see Frankie dance.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.700
- Really.
- Yeah.

07:27.700 --> 07:28.533
- Yeah, no.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.100
So Rachel's lame
attempt at humor.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.767
We'll get used to it,
Victoria, don't worry.

07:33.767 --> 07:35.000
- No way she's serious.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.767
She just needs like
half a bottle of vodka

07:36.767 --> 07:39.333
and like a hot room.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.500
- And an even hotter guy.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.433
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

07:42.433 --> 07:43.667
- I forget about that one.

07:43.667 --> 07:45.567
- Whatever Rachel
you win this round.

07:45.567 --> 07:48.433
Just wait till later
when we all are drinking,

07:48.433 --> 07:49.500
all will be revealed.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.033
- Sleepy girls.

08:09.367 --> 08:10.967
Wake up sleepy heads.

08:12.067 --> 08:13.033
Wakey, wakey.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.133
- Oy.

08:16.133 --> 08:16.967
Wake up.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.000
- Are we there yet?

08:19.433 --> 08:21.033
- I think so.

08:51.233 --> 08:53.300
- Oh, it's breathtaking.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.133
Ah.

09:00.133 --> 09:00.933
- You just

09:01.900 --> 09:03.567
stop that right now.

09:13.467 --> 09:14.700
What's wrong, Sarah?

09:14.700 --> 09:17.267
- Nothing, the
key it's supposed to

09:17.267 --> 09:19.300
be under a rock or something.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.000
- And what if it's not here?

09:22.167 --> 09:25.567
- Well, then we
sleep in the car.

09:27.900 --> 09:28.867
- Okay.
- Shine the late

09:28.867 --> 09:29.800
over here, Sarah.

09:32.767 --> 09:33.600
- Oh, found it.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.433
I found it.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.833
- Technically I found it, but.

09:36.833 --> 09:38.000
- Yeah.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.667
- God it is freezing.

09:42.167 --> 09:43.900
- Here we go.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.267
- Wow, this is so cool.

09:58.267 --> 09:59.400
- Who lit the fire?

10:00.900 --> 10:01.833
- That must have been Oddle.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.467
He's the odd job man here.

10:03.467 --> 10:05.800
- Oddle what kind
of name is that?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.500
- Strange one.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.633
- Looks like no one's
been here for a while.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.800
- Wow, if this was my place,

10:12.800 --> 10:15.233
I would be here all the time.

10:15.233 --> 10:16.400
This is amazing.
- Guys,

10:16.400 --> 10:17.533
I seriously wanna live here.

10:20.467 --> 10:21.967
- It's probably just the wind.

10:22.933 --> 10:24.500
Right, Frankie?

10:32.267 --> 10:33.767
- We're fine.
- That was so weird.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.200
- Really freaked me out.
- Hey, let's take these off.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.167
- Let me help you.

10:37.733 --> 10:39.600
Oh, Frankie.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.233
- Sorry, I hope you're
not allergic to dust.

10:42.233 --> 10:44.500
- Rachel, do you wanna come
help me with the luggage?

10:44.500 --> 10:45.800
- Yes, yes I do.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.433
- This place is unreal
I cannot believe

10:53.433 --> 10:55.467
that nobody lives here.
- I know, right.

11:01.633 --> 11:02.867
- That was easy.

11:02.867 --> 11:05.100
Guys, look what
Rachel brought us.

11:11.367 --> 11:13.267
Small one for Victoria.

11:14.533 --> 11:16.567
- Cool.
- Your welcome.

11:16.567 --> 11:18.900
Bigger one for Frankie.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.633
Here you go, Rachel.

11:24.633 --> 11:26.533
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

11:27.633 --> 11:30.000
- Okay, first things first

11:30.000 --> 11:34.733
here's to a real
girl's weekend finally.

11:34.733 --> 11:36.033
Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:36.033 --> 11:37.433
- Wait.

11:37.433 --> 11:38.433
A toast.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.233
May we get what we want.

11:42.433 --> 11:44.167
May we get what we need.

11:45.333 --> 11:48.333
But may we never
get what we deserve.

11:50.367 --> 11:51.300
- Cheers.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.300
- Cheers.
- Cheers girls.

11:58.033 --> 11:59.000
- Thank you so much, Rachel.

11:59.000 --> 11:59.800
This is really nice of you.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.500
- You're welcome.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.767
Can't remember the last
time I had champagne.

12:03.767 --> 12:05.267
- This was yum.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.300
- More please.
- Good.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.767
- Wow, Frankie's on a role.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.567
Anyone else?
- You can top me up.

12:12.567 --> 12:13.800
- Sure.
- But I'm gonna

12:13.800 --> 12:15.867
go find out where
the washroom is.

12:15.867 --> 12:17.033
- Light weight.

12:19.533 --> 12:20.600
Doesn't she work in a bar.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.567
- I can hear you.

12:21.567 --> 12:23.300
- More for you.
- Yes.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.900
- Great.

13:05.633 --> 13:07.733
- She was the one
that we were checking out.

13:07.733 --> 13:08.567
- Yes,
that's what I'm saying.

13:08.567 --> 13:10.067
You don't remember her?

13:10.067 --> 13:12.600
- I didn't notice
her panties showing though.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.400
- What are you talking about?

13:14.400 --> 13:15.867
- Nothing.

13:15.867 --> 13:17.567
- Well, don't go rushing
for the bathroom.

13:17.567 --> 13:20.700
The toilet's busted but we
do have a shower that works.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.967
- Yeah, he did kind of mention

13:22.967 --> 13:25.167
there may be a problem
with the septic tank.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.000
- What are we
supposed to do then?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.633
- Well, there's an outhouse.

13:28.633 --> 13:29.467
- Oh, there is.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.433
- Like outside.

13:31.433 --> 13:32.267
- Yeah.

13:32.267 --> 13:33.767
- It'll be fine.

13:33.767 --> 13:35.033
It's just part of the adventure.

13:35.033 --> 13:37.333
That's why we left
the city, isn't it?

13:37.333 --> 13:38.167
- It's true.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.067
- Why don't we go outside for
a walk before we go to bed.

13:43.067 --> 13:44.300
- What?

13:44.300 --> 13:46.000
No, it's so warm
and cozy in here.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.300
Let's stay here.
- Come on girls.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.833
We're adventurers.

13:48.833 --> 13:52.000
- Yeah, let's do it
come on, Victoria.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.533
- Unless you wanna stay here,

13:53.533 --> 13:54.733
and then go for the outhouse
in the middle of the night

13:54.733 --> 13:56.100
by yourself in the dark.
- Okay, okay.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.333
No, I don't wanna do that.

13:57.333 --> 13:58.833
Okay, I'm coming.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.100
- That was easy.

14:07.067 --> 14:07.900
- Listen.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.100
- To what?

14:12.067 --> 14:13.933
- Nothing, just silence.

14:15.233 --> 14:17.633
- That's funny when
do we hear silence.

14:17.633 --> 14:19.333
- It's such an observation.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.167
- I know.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.500
- What was that?

14:25.500 --> 14:26.667
- A werewolf.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.133
- Stop it.

14:34.267 --> 14:35.100
- Careful.

14:36.467 --> 14:37.800
- Guys, I seriously heard
something this time.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.733
- Victoria, it's the trees.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.900
It's nothing come on relax.

14:42.900 --> 14:46.000
- So cold can we please
go back inside now

14:46.000 --> 14:46.933
please, please, please.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.200
- Yeah, you know what I agree.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.633
Let's go it's cold.

14:49.633 --> 14:51.400
- This is not such
a great idea guys.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.300
- You guys are so
adventurous it's astounding.

15:04.867 --> 15:07.833
- Isn't this fire so beautiful.

15:07.833 --> 15:08.700
- I love it.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.500
Reminds me of camping with
my dad when I was young.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.533
I miss him a lot.

15:16.667 --> 15:17.533
- Your dad died.

15:19.567 --> 15:20.667
- Yeah.

15:22.167 --> 15:24.133
He had a small plane.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.000
He loved it.

15:27.167 --> 15:30.033
He'd go away on weekends,
sometimes he'd take me.

15:33.467 --> 15:35.700
He and my mom split
when I was five.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.533
One Saturday

15:42.333 --> 15:46.233
he crashed into the
side of a mountain.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.467
Nobody knows why
or what happened.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.467
I never got a chance
to say goodbye

15:54.467 --> 15:56.100
or tell him how
much I loved him.

15:57.967 --> 15:58.933
- I'm sure he knew.

16:00.967 --> 16:01.800
- But that's it.

16:03.567 --> 16:04.400
He didn't.

16:05.933 --> 16:08.667
We had a fight two days before,

16:08.667 --> 16:11.067
and he called me and I
never called him back.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.300
I was angry that's all.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.400
I felt so bad.

16:24.733 --> 16:28.900
Anyway that was a
long time ago now.

16:28.900 --> 16:29.733
I've moved on.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.433
- He knew you
loved him, Frankie.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.233
- Yeah.

16:41.533 --> 16:42.700
I wanna believe he did.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.200
- I know this is
really bad timing,

16:52.433 --> 16:54.900
but I really gotta
use that outhouse.

16:54.900 --> 16:55.700
- Oh, my god.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.800
- I'm sorry I have a
small bladder, guys.

17:51.567 --> 17:52.467
Ugh, gross.

18:24.567 --> 18:26.067
It was awful.

18:26.067 --> 18:28.967
Don't go unless you're
desperate I'm serious.

18:28.967 --> 18:30.067
- Great.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.200
I have to pee in a bowl.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.133
- Probably, yeah.

18:33.267 --> 18:34.100
- Seriously.

18:38.767 --> 18:40.867
Do you guys think this
place could be haunted?

18:40.867 --> 18:43.267
- Probably, at night
things will move around.

18:44.933 --> 18:46.667
- Don't say that.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.167
I'll never sleep.

18:48.167 --> 18:50.633
I have to sleep with a
light on at home as it is.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.333
- Wow, Victoria.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.133
I love garlic bread so much.

18:57.133 --> 18:59.900
But every time I eat it I
have the weirdest dreams.

18:59.900 --> 19:00.833
- Really.
- Yeah.

19:00.833 --> 19:03.867
- What kind of dreams, Frankie?

19:03.867 --> 19:05.267
- Not those kinds of dreams.

19:08.167 --> 19:09.333
Maybe sometimes.

19:11.567 --> 19:12.400
- How's Paul?

19:13.533 --> 19:15.333
- His days are numbered.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.567
- I'm sorry.

19:16.567 --> 19:17.833
- Well, don't be
it's me I'm bored.

19:17.833 --> 19:21.067
It's just too
comfortable, no sparks.

19:21.067 --> 19:23.233
- So who's giving
you those sparks.

19:24.700 --> 19:27.533
- Well, there is this new guy
at one of the gyms I work at.

19:27.533 --> 19:28.367
- Toby?

19:30.200 --> 19:31.300
- Yes, it's Toby.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.200
- Frankie, I knew it.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.133
- Whatever.

19:37.133 --> 19:38.667
- You're so predictable.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.800
- What about you, Sarah?

19:44.333 --> 19:45.233
- You know me.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.700
All work no play.

19:47.700 --> 19:48.700
- Well, we're gonna
have to fix that.

19:48.700 --> 19:49.933
- Right, yes we are.

19:49.933 --> 19:51.967
- Yeah, you have to
have fun in your life.

19:51.967 --> 19:54.100
I'm gonna fix you up with
someone from my work.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.033
No fun, no life.

19:56.033 --> 19:57.433
Frankie's number
one rule to live by.

19:57.433 --> 19:58.367
- Amen.

19:59.667 --> 20:02.133
- Do you have any hot
single ones for me?

20:02.133 --> 20:04.467
- Yeah, and there are some
even hotter married ones.

20:04.467 --> 20:06.633
- Frankie.
- They're the best.

20:06.633 --> 20:08.733
Seriously, there's no strings

20:08.733 --> 20:09.667
and you just get to have fun

20:09.667 --> 20:10.800
and then you can leave them.

20:14.033 --> 20:15.700
So I've heard.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.467
- Okay.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.900
- What?
- We have a dark house.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.467
- Apparently.
- Victoria.

20:21.467 --> 20:23.533
- I'm just kidding.
- No, you weren't.

20:23.533 --> 20:27.500
- No you weren't.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.700
- Do you guys hear that?

20:29.700 --> 20:30.867
- What?

20:30.867 --> 20:32.333
- Probably just a
branch hitting the roof.

20:32.333 --> 20:33.400
I wouldn't worry about it.

20:42.367 --> 20:45.733
- A lot of creaks in
these wooden houses.

20:49.767 --> 20:50.733
- Oh, my god.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.633
We should play truth or dare.

20:53.633 --> 20:54.467
- No.

20:54.467 --> 20:56.267
- What, yes come on.

20:56.267 --> 20:57.433
It'll be so much fun.

20:58.367 --> 20:59.300
- Did she just finish the wine?

20:59.300 --> 21:00.167
- Come on.
- Yep.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.733
- But she's got more.

21:03.733 --> 21:05.300
Please.

21:05.300 --> 21:07.200
- Okay.
- Really.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.867
- Come on let's
do it for Victoria.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.500
- Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.200
- Coming Victoria.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.900
- Rachel, you can
come sit with me.

21:15.900 --> 21:16.933
- Okay.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.300
- I'm so excited.

21:25.567 --> 21:27.133
Okay.

21:27.133 --> 21:27.933
Rachel.

21:30.267 --> 21:31.300
You go first.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.133
- Okay.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.233
Oh, Sarah.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.167
Truth or dare.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.733
- Truth obviously.

21:44.733 --> 21:45.667
- Typical, typical.

21:46.667 --> 21:47.433
Alright.

21:50.733 --> 21:52.033
Where'd you first do it?

21:52.033 --> 21:53.000
- Do it?
- Yeah.

21:54.433 --> 21:55.433
- Where.

21:56.967 --> 21:57.800
Where.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.233
- It was so long ago.

21:59.233 --> 22:02.433
It's so hard to remember.
- Okay, I remember.

22:02.433 --> 22:03.567
In my garage.

22:03.567 --> 22:05.067
- In your garage.

22:05.067 --> 22:08.733
- I hooked up with my first
boyfriend in my dad's garage.

22:09.667 --> 22:11.000
- Oh.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.233
- Who's the lucky guy?

22:12.233 --> 22:15.233
- No, that's another
question, Frankie.

22:15.233 --> 22:16.467
- Okay.
- What.

22:16.467 --> 22:17.300
- It's your turn.

22:21.867 --> 22:24.767
- Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.

22:24.767 --> 22:26.733
It's pay back time.

22:26.733 --> 22:27.633
Truth or dare.

22:29.567 --> 22:31.967
- Dare, definitely dare.

22:34.433 --> 22:35.267
- Kiss, Frankie.

22:43.467 --> 22:44.300
- Shots.

22:47.167 --> 22:48.067
- Did you see that?

22:48.067 --> 22:49.633
- I did see that.

22:49.633 --> 22:51.600
- Cheers.

22:56.567 --> 22:57.367
- Yuck.

22:58.467 --> 22:59.367
- Alright.
- Sorry.

23:01.900 --> 23:03.500
You okay, Victoria?

23:06.733 --> 23:07.967
- No more drinks for you.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.733
- Oh, the dark horse.

23:18.967 --> 23:20.400
Victoria.
- Yeah.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.400
- Truth or dare.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.400
- Dare, no truth, truth.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.300
- Have you ever made
out with a girl before?

23:31.133 --> 23:32.500
- Yes.

23:32.500 --> 23:33.500
- And.

23:34.900 --> 23:37.900
- She was a girl from dance,
and we were at a party.

23:39.667 --> 23:43.200
We had a little bit to drink,
and we just had some fun.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.167
- Fun.

23:44.167 --> 23:45.367
- Fun.

23:45.367 --> 23:46.200
- Okay.

23:47.900 --> 23:49.300
- Okay, my spin.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.133
- Go.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.867
- Oh, yes, Frankie.

23:55.633 --> 23:56.800
- Truth or dare.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.033
- Dare.

23:58.033 --> 23:58.967
- Take your top off.

24:02.667 --> 24:03.667
- So eager.

24:13.433 --> 24:14.600
- Got the job, ladies.

24:16.133 --> 24:17.733
- Sounds like you've
said that before.

24:17.733 --> 24:19.033
- Jerk.

24:19.033 --> 24:19.967
- Hey.

24:19.967 --> 24:22.100
- Okay, okay, okay guys.

24:22.100 --> 24:23.133
Put your top back on.

24:25.233 --> 24:27.400
- As much fun as I'm
having, Victoria.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.033
I am so tired.

24:29.033 --> 24:30.600
I think I'm gonna turn in.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.767
- Actually me know too.

24:31.767 --> 24:33.233
It was a really long drive,

24:33.233 --> 24:35.667
which I did by
myself by the way.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.433
- Well, good for you.

24:39.433 --> 24:42.167
I was also in the car but fine.

24:42.167 --> 24:43.167
- Did you hear that?

24:44.000 --> 24:44.833
- What?

24:46.733 --> 24:48.167
- That scratching sound.

24:49.233 --> 24:50.067
- No.

24:54.033 --> 24:55.533
- Did you hear it, Rachel?

24:55.533 --> 24:58.333
- No, but, I've had a cold
and my ears are plugged.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.433
- See there it is again.

25:04.167 --> 25:06.133
- How are you the only one
who's hearing all these noises?

25:06.133 --> 25:08.333
- Well, I definitely
heard it this time.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.300
- I think it's time for bed.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.667
- Yeah.

25:14.667 --> 25:15.567
Tomorrow's a new day let's go.

25:15.567 --> 25:16.400
- Yeah, come on.

25:23.267 --> 25:25.100
- Okay goodnight guys.
- Okay.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.333
- See you.
- Night.

25:26.333 --> 25:28.300
- See you
tomorrow goodnight.

25:28.300 --> 25:29.433
- Love you guys.

28:51.833 --> 28:52.667
- Sarah.

28:54.867 --> 28:55.667
Sarah.

28:57.367 --> 28:59.233
Sarah.
- Victoria.

28:59.233 --> 29:00.667
You were out early.

29:00.667 --> 29:02.967
- There was somebody
watching me in the forest.

29:02.967 --> 29:04.000
- You sure?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.267
- Yes, I'm sure I saw him.

29:06.267 --> 29:08.700
- Calm down it was
probably nothing.

29:08.700 --> 29:10.067
- He was down by the water.

29:11.433 --> 29:14.700
- Victoria, once I'm dressed
I will go take a look.

29:16.600 --> 29:17.433
But honestly,

29:18.567 --> 29:19.933
I think it was just Oddle.

29:23.133 --> 29:24.133
So,

29:25.767 --> 29:26.767
how did you sleep?

29:27.900 --> 29:30.133
- Terrible there
were so many noises.

29:30.133 --> 29:31.600
I almost came into your room.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.067
- You should have.

29:33.067 --> 29:36.433
I mean, you know with
these wooden houses though

29:36.433 --> 29:38.800
these creaks and noises
are all part of the charm.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.400
It's really not such a big deal.

29:42.100 --> 29:43.967
- Morning.
- Morning.

29:43.967 --> 29:44.800
Coffee.

29:45.667 --> 29:47.300
- What was happening last night?

29:47.300 --> 29:48.633
- The noises you heard them too?

29:48.633 --> 29:49.900
- Yeah, you bet I did.

29:49.900 --> 29:52.000
I don't think I slept
for more than an hour.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.933
- There was a man staring
at me in the woods.

29:56.267 --> 29:57.500
- Are you serious?

29:57.500 --> 29:59.233
- Yes, and why would
I be lying about that?

29:59.233 --> 30:01.000
- Hi, ladies.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.167
Hey.
- Victoria.

30:02.167 --> 30:04.133
Can you grab that.
- Hi, yeah.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.733
- It was probably
Oddle, that odd job man.

30:08.733 --> 30:10.933
- Well, can you tell
him to fix the toilet.

30:10.933 --> 30:12.200
I was desperate last night,

30:12.200 --> 30:14.433
but there was no way
I was going outside.

30:14.433 --> 30:16.033
This looks great.

30:16.033 --> 30:18.600
- So what do we have
planned for today, ladies?

30:18.600 --> 30:20.900
- So I was thinking
after breakfast

30:20.900 --> 30:23.700
we could go for a walk by
the lake how does that sound?

30:23.700 --> 30:24.633
- Yeah.
- Good.

30:24.633 --> 30:25.633
- Yeah, sounds good to me.

30:28.933 --> 30:30.567
Why what's the problem?

30:30.567 --> 30:33.300
- There was a man in
the woods staring at me.

30:33.300 --> 30:35.133
- What kind of man,
your imagery friend?

30:35.133 --> 30:36.567
- It's not funny.
- Frankie.

30:37.967 --> 30:38.833
Have a strawberry.

30:40.167 --> 30:41.700
- I'm allergic to strawberries.

30:45.233 --> 30:48.067
- Guys, the
strawberries are fresh.

31:02.700 --> 31:04.633
- It's so quiet.

31:04.633 --> 31:06.333
- You can hear
your own breathing.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.033
It's absolute silence.

31:14.833 --> 31:16.200
The only noise is what we make.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.167
- Not last night.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.800
I wasn't making any of those
noises last night I swear.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.767
There was somebody in
the woods this morning.

31:24.833 --> 31:27.333
- Victoria, come on.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.867
- Where did Frankie go?

31:34.867 --> 31:37.900
- Oh, yeah, where
did Frankie go?

31:39.833 --> 31:41.433
Frankie.

31:41.433 --> 31:42.700
- Frankie.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.200
- Come out, come out
wherever you are.

31:46.700 --> 31:47.533
- Frankie.

31:49.933 --> 31:50.833
- Got you.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.567
- You scared
the crap out of me.

31:53.567 --> 31:54.433
- Frankie.

31:55.567 --> 31:57.067
- She's not happy.

31:57.067 --> 31:58.700
- Real mature, Frankie.
- Poor baby.

31:58.700 --> 32:00.000
Poor baby.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.333
- Okay, come on.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.667
- I wasn't kidding you
know there was somebody.

32:10.967 --> 32:12.600
- Do you believe
in the paranormal,

32:12.600 --> 32:14.167
you know like the other side?

32:15.400 --> 32:16.233
- I don't know.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.300
I mean, I've been
seeing my dad again,

32:20.300 --> 32:23.200
so, yeah, I guess I do.

32:26.633 --> 32:28.367
- I've had strange
feelings before.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.233
- Like what?

32:31.233 --> 32:34.033
- Like I've known
things I shouldn't know.

32:34.033 --> 32:36.333
Know about a place and I
haven't even been there.

32:37.967 --> 32:38.833
- Like deja vu.

32:41.700 --> 32:43.133
- Yeah.

32:43.133 --> 32:44.967
Sometimes I meet
someone and it's like

32:44.967 --> 32:46.000
we have a connection.

32:46.900 --> 32:48.500
Like I've known them before.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.067
- Like you've known
them in a past life.

32:50.067 --> 32:52.033
- Yeah, but really know them.

32:52.033 --> 32:53.700
Sometimes I even know
what they're gonna say.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.500
- I've had that before.

32:55.500 --> 32:59.200
No, it's like there's a
connection at another level.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.600
- Don't fight it.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.500
There's a theory that
primitive mankind are psychic.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.833
They used to communicate
just by thinking.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.800
Kind of makes you wonder

33:09.700 --> 33:11.767
why did language evolve?

33:11.767 --> 33:14.200
- Well, to express more emotion.

33:15.867 --> 33:17.367
- No.

33:17.367 --> 33:18.433
- Why then.

33:19.800 --> 33:20.633
- To lie.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.433
- That's freaky.

33:23.433 --> 33:25.433
If you were psychic,
then you couldn't lie.

33:25.433 --> 33:26.867
- Exactly.

33:26.867 --> 33:28.800
- And the human race
thrives on greed,

33:28.800 --> 33:31.333
which needs lies to
make it all work.

33:31.333 --> 33:33.200
- That's way too deep for me.

33:34.767 --> 33:36.000
- Just think about it.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.233
Imagine you could
talk to someone

33:37.233 --> 33:38.933
and know exactly what
they were thinking.

33:38.933 --> 33:40.700
- My brother would
be in real shit.

33:44.167 --> 33:46.133
- Victoria,
are you okay?

33:46.133 --> 33:48.600
- Yeah, just tired.

33:49.867 --> 33:51.400
I didn't sleep well last night.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.667
- This is perfection.

33:56.700 --> 33:57.567
- Sarah.

33:57.567 --> 33:59.333
- What.
- Okay.

33:59.333 --> 34:00.233
- Victoria.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.767
- I'm sorry,
Frankie, I'll get it.

34:10.933 --> 34:13.500
Uh, it's pretty far out.

34:13.500 --> 34:14.433
- It is far.

34:15.699 --> 34:17.000
Victoria, I don't think
you should go on that.

34:17.000 --> 34:17.833
- Victoria, what are you doing?

34:17.833 --> 34:19.132
- It's fine.

34:20.632 --> 34:22.600
- Victoria, it's too dangerous.

34:28.900 --> 34:29.733
- Victoria.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.367
You're my responsibility
please be careful.

34:40.033 --> 34:42.567
Victoria, you don't need
to do this just come back.

34:46.067 --> 34:47.000
- I got it.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.067
- You have to be careful.

34:52.100 --> 34:52.933
Victoria.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.633
- Oh, my god.

34:59.633 --> 35:00.833
- Help.

35:00.833 --> 35:01.900
Help.

35:01.900 --> 35:02.733
Help.

35:06.100 --> 35:06.933
- Help.

35:09.067 --> 35:09.967
Victoria.

35:09.967 --> 35:10.800
Victoria.

35:11.767 --> 35:12.600
Frankie.

35:13.767 --> 35:15.433
Be careful, be careful.

35:15.433 --> 35:16.267
Help.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.600
Frankie.
- Victoria.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.700
Do you see her?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.233
- Help.

35:34.433 --> 35:35.367
- Sarah, help.

35:35.367 --> 35:36.833
Frankie, are you alright?

35:54.533 --> 35:56.767
- Rachel, get her a brandy.

36:00.533 --> 36:01.967
Victoria,

36:01.967 --> 36:03.300
that was really dangerous.

36:03.300 --> 36:04.233
You could have drowned.

36:04.233 --> 36:05.600
- I couldn't get my foot out.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.500
It was strange it was like I was

36:09.500 --> 36:12.000
being pulled into another world.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.167
I know that sounds weird, but

36:17.333 --> 36:19.633
I felt like somebody was
in the water with me.

36:20.633 --> 36:23.233
I wasn't scared I really wasn't.

36:23.233 --> 36:24.467
- You're in shock, Victoria.

36:24.467 --> 36:25.700
Okay, sip this slowly.

36:25.700 --> 36:27.933
- No, because somebody
was pulling me down.

36:27.933 --> 36:30.433
- Yes, Victoria, the canoe was.

36:30.433 --> 36:32.100
Here drink this.

36:34.333 --> 36:36.367
- You okay, Frankie?

36:36.367 --> 36:37.267
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:39.833 --> 36:40.867
You alright, Vic?

36:40.867 --> 36:41.733
- Thanks to you.

36:44.067 --> 36:45.400
Frankie, you saved my life.

36:49.700 --> 36:52.133
- It was really scary in there.

36:52.133 --> 36:54.200
- I just couldn't
get my foot out.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.700
- It's all over now.

36:55.700 --> 36:58.200
Okay, just another chapter
in the book of life I guess.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.833
- Yeah.

37:00.833 --> 37:02.433
One I'd really like to edit out.

37:06.300 --> 37:08.200
I think I'm gonna go lay down.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.633
- It's a good idea, Vic?

37:09.633 --> 37:10.467
- Are you warm enough?

37:10.467 --> 37:11.300
- Uh-huh.

37:12.433 --> 37:13.600
- Rach, will you go with her?

37:13.600 --> 37:14.433
- Yeah, here.

37:17.433 --> 37:18.267
Go ahead.

37:36.867 --> 37:41.200
- That could've been
really, really bad.

37:43.267 --> 37:44.267
- She could've died.

37:49.233 --> 37:51.000
It all just happened so fast.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.733
You're a real hero, Frankie.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.767
This is an adventure
we're having.

38:29.767 --> 38:31.667
It's not exactly what
I imagined I'd be doing

38:31.667 --> 38:34.067
jumping fully clothed
into a freezing cold lake.

38:35.233 --> 38:37.467
- It'd be a pretty sweet
Instagram pick though.

38:38.867 --> 38:41.533
- Bet that's not the only crazy
thing that's happened here.

38:41.533 --> 38:43.533
- Yeah, this place
definitely has some history.

38:43.533 --> 38:45.300
That outhouse is ancient.

38:45.300 --> 38:47.167
- Well, there was a
house on this property

38:47.167 --> 38:48.767
for over 150 years.

38:48.767 --> 38:49.767
- Really.

38:49.767 --> 38:51.100
- It burnt down.

38:51.100 --> 38:52.767
But this one's pretty new.

38:52.767 --> 38:54.267
- It's crazy to think
generations of people

38:54.267 --> 38:55.367
might have lived here.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.533
- My professor
said that it's been

38:58.533 --> 39:00.900
in his family for over
three generations.

39:00.900 --> 39:02.433
- Doesn't he ever come here.

39:02.433 --> 39:04.867
- No, he doesn't
I don't know why.

39:04.867 --> 39:06.867
- Maybe he prefers
to party in the city.

39:08.233 --> 39:09.467
- Professor French.

39:12.867 --> 39:15.100
He's a Arachnologist.

39:15.100 --> 39:15.933
- A what?

39:17.167 --> 39:19.900
- Spiders, he's into spiders.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.233
Spiders.

39:21.233 --> 39:23.067
- You're joking right.

39:23.067 --> 39:24.067
- No.

39:24.067 --> 39:26.033
- I hate spiders.

39:26.033 --> 39:28.600
You don't think he ever
had them here though?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.267
- Then you would love
Professor French then.

39:30.267 --> 39:31.533
- Sarah, I'm serious.

39:31.533 --> 39:32.867
Okay, they freak me out.

39:34.033 --> 39:35.533
You don't think there'd
be any in my bedroom.

39:35.533 --> 39:37.000
'Cause Victoria said she
heard a scratching sound.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.300
- It might be a spider.

39:38.300 --> 39:40.133
- Sarah, it's not funny.

39:40.133 --> 39:41.467
- Do you want me
to check your room?

39:41.467 --> 39:43.100
- Yeah.
- Rachel.

39:43.100 --> 39:44.033
- What.

39:44.033 --> 39:45.467
- I don't believe you.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.767
- They're furry freaky little
unpredictable critters.

39:47.767 --> 39:48.800
- Rachel, let's go.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.900
- They're cute.
- They're cute.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.000
You're disgusting.

40:01.100 --> 40:02.267
- No, spiders down here.

40:02.267 --> 40:04.567
- Just please check
again, please.

40:08.567 --> 40:10.900
- Here spidey, spidey, spidey.

40:12.400 --> 40:13.667
No, we're good.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.700
- Would you mind just
checking the closet, please?

40:25.067 --> 40:26.200
- It's an ironing board.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.200
We're not in danger.

40:31.300 --> 40:32.900
Look at all this stuff.

40:32.900 --> 40:33.867
- Do you see anything?

40:33.867 --> 40:35.300
- Yeah, I see lots of things.

40:38.633 --> 40:40.133
Look at this.

40:40.133 --> 40:40.933
- What?

40:41.867 --> 40:43.467
What is that?

40:43.467 --> 40:45.133
- It's a Ouija board.

40:45.133 --> 40:46.400
- Really.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.900
- Sarah
is gonna love this.

40:53.100 --> 40:54.367
- Look what
the Frankie found.

40:54.367 --> 40:55.333
- What?

40:55.333 --> 40:57.167
- A Ouija board and tarot cards.

40:57.167 --> 40:58.533
- What.
- Yeah.

40:58.533 --> 40:59.567
- We should play.

41:00.600 --> 41:01.433
I played it before.

41:01.433 --> 41:02.300
It was creepy but fun.

41:02.300 --> 41:03.733
- Me too.

41:04.933 --> 41:07.700
Maybe we can find out
who used to live here.

41:07.700 --> 41:08.633
- I'm game.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.200
- You're always game.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.067
- Hey, guys.

41:12.267 --> 41:13.567
- How are you feeling?

41:13.567 --> 41:14.533
- A lot
better actually.

41:14.533 --> 41:15.933
I feel like I slept forever.

41:15.933 --> 41:17.533
- Good.
- Good.

41:17.533 --> 41:19.433
- Well, Frankie's
been exploring.

41:19.433 --> 41:20.733
She found a Ouija board.

41:20.733 --> 41:22.233
- Yeah.

41:22.233 --> 41:24.500
We're gonna have some
fun from the dark side.

41:25.433 --> 41:26.267
- Really.

41:27.533 --> 41:29.967
So, how do you play?

41:29.967 --> 41:31.433
What are the rules?

41:31.433 --> 41:33.733
- It's easy you just put
your fingers on the pointer.

41:33.733 --> 41:34.967
You can't push it.

41:34.967 --> 41:36.033
You have to let
it move by itself.

41:36.033 --> 41:37.667
We ask questions,

41:37.667 --> 41:40.267
and we see if the spirit
wants to connect with us.

41:40.267 --> 41:42.000
- It's just for fun, right?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.033
- Of course.

41:43.033 --> 41:44.133
Let's see what happens.

41:45.033 --> 41:46.267
- We need a pen and paper.

41:49.467 --> 41:52.533
- Turn the lights off,
Sarah, just candles.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.567
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.300
- Nothing's happening.

42:27.167 --> 42:29.300
What's supposed to happen?

42:29.300 --> 42:30.800
- Be patient.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.767
- Nothing might
happen, Victoria.

42:32.767 --> 42:34.767
No spirits wanna
come out and play.

42:34.767 --> 42:37.900
Maybe they've all
gone out to party.

42:37.900 --> 42:40.633
- Well, why are
we doing it then?

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
Okay, who's moving this.

43:26.300 --> 43:28.900
- It's kind of freaky.

43:28.900 --> 43:31.000
- Who are you talking to?

43:39.300 --> 43:41.367
What is that, I?
- Uh-huh.

43:48.267 --> 43:49.100
- O.

43:51.600 --> 43:52.467
R.

43:54.033 --> 43:55.900
- I don't wanna do this anymore.

43:55.900 --> 43:56.800
- Victoria.

43:58.833 --> 44:00.400
It's okay.

44:00.400 --> 44:01.400
We're all in this, right?

44:01.400 --> 44:02.667
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:05.067 --> 44:05.900
- Vic.

44:12.100 --> 44:12.933
Who

44:14.267 --> 44:15.333
are you?

44:26.333 --> 44:27.233
- Who's me?

44:43.967 --> 44:46.700
- I'm in the lake.

44:48.433 --> 44:49.500
- Oh, my god.

44:55.467 --> 44:56.967
- Oh, my god.

45:01.433 --> 45:03.933
- Okay,
who's moving it?

45:03.933 --> 45:04.767
- I'm not.

45:04.767 --> 45:05.967
Are you, Sarah?

45:07.767 --> 45:09.300
Frankie.

45:09.300 --> 45:10.300
- No, I'm not.

45:34.767 --> 45:36.600
- Lonely, that's the word.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.000
- Lonely, who's lonely.

45:38.000 --> 45:38.833
- Shh.

45:40.800 --> 45:41.633
Spirit,

45:43.133 --> 45:44.133
if you're with us,

45:45.167 --> 45:46.167
please tell us.

45:47.300 --> 45:48.267
Give us a sign.

46:00.700 --> 46:02.100
Victoria, it's okay.

46:02.100 --> 46:03.967
- It is not okay
there's somebody here.

46:03.967 --> 46:04.900
I can feel them.

46:04.900 --> 46:06.600
- Victoria, it can't be real.

46:06.600 --> 46:07.700
- It is real.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.733
Somebody's here I
know that they are.

46:16.833 --> 46:20.100
- I gotta tell you something.

46:20.100 --> 46:22.667
None of this is real.

46:22.667 --> 46:24.700
I set this entire thing up.

46:24.700 --> 46:25.633
- Set what up?

46:26.800 --> 46:28.833
- I filmed this entire
thing with cameras.

46:30.800 --> 46:31.800
It's for my Ph.D.

46:32.733 --> 46:34.333
I'm doing a study on fear,

46:35.800 --> 46:37.333
but this has just gone too far.

46:37.333 --> 46:38.700
I can't do this anymore.

46:39.967 --> 46:42.067
- So all those noises

46:43.200 --> 46:44.633
that was all you?

46:44.633 --> 46:47.033
- Yeah, I kind of
set that all up.

46:47.033 --> 46:49.900
I didn't think it would
come down to all this.

46:49.900 --> 46:50.900
It's weird.

46:52.100 --> 46:54.100
- I was really starting
to believe all of that.

46:55.567 --> 46:56.667
I really was.

46:58.333 --> 46:59.333
- I'm sorry.

47:00.500 --> 47:02.033
- So you filmed
this whole thing.

47:03.567 --> 47:05.033
- Just some of it.

47:05.033 --> 47:05.867
- Wow.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.700
You really are something else.

47:12.667 --> 47:13.967
When were you gonna tell us?

47:13.967 --> 47:15.833
- After filming,

47:15.833 --> 47:18.233
I was gonna ask for your
permission to use it.

47:18.233 --> 47:20.167
- I wanna see it.

47:20.167 --> 47:21.567
Now.

47:21.567 --> 47:22.400
- Rachel.

47:29.933 --> 47:31.533
- That's so weird.

47:32.400 --> 47:34.133
There's a glow around Victoria.

47:35.867 --> 47:37.333
- That's
just a night vision.

47:37.333 --> 47:39.167
- Yeah, it's really
spooky though.

47:39.167 --> 47:40.200
Look at the Ouija board, guys.

47:40.200 --> 47:41.733
There's a glow around that too.

47:41.733 --> 47:43.533
- I was feeling something.

47:43.533 --> 47:45.533
Okay, I was there was
something in the cabin.

47:45.533 --> 47:47.233
I mean that's why
I was so scared.

47:47.233 --> 47:49.433
- I told you I
created everything.

47:49.433 --> 47:52.800
- No, Sarah, not what I
was feeling I know it.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.033
- Victoria.

47:54.033 --> 47:56.600
- Rachel, I know what
I was feeling, okay.

47:56.600 --> 47:59.033
- You see what you've done
you've totally freaked her out.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.233
It's okay, Victoria.

48:02.233 --> 48:03.867
We can prove that
there's no one here.

48:03.867 --> 48:04.933
We'll just go back
to the Ouija board

48:04.933 --> 48:05.867
and nothing will happen.

48:05.867 --> 48:07.600
- What if something does happen?

48:07.600 --> 48:09.667
- It won't I promise.

48:17.067 --> 48:19.100
See, Vic, nothing.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
There's nobody here.

48:23.267 --> 48:25.267
- I'm so sorry I did
all this, Victoria.

48:33.700 --> 48:35.767
- Who moved it guys?

48:35.767 --> 48:37.500
- I didn't did you, Sarah?

48:37.500 --> 48:38.700
- After all this.

48:39.767 --> 48:41.267
- Victoria?

48:41.267 --> 48:42.100
- No.

48:45.667 --> 48:47.333
- Ask the spirit's
name, Frankie?

48:49.600 --> 48:51.000
- What is your name, spirit?

49:10.567 --> 49:11.400
Mary.

49:15.767 --> 49:17.000
When did you die, Mary?

49:27.167 --> 49:28.000
1965.

49:32.433 --> 49:33.267
Where?

49:45.367 --> 49:47.133
- Oh, my god she died here.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.267
- Why are you still here?

49:52.567 --> 49:54.067
Why are you here?

50:01.967 --> 50:03.367
- I don't wanna do this anymore.

50:03.367 --> 50:04.367
- Victoria.

50:04.367 --> 50:06.400
- I am not gonna
do this anymore.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.733
- You can't break the
circle during a seance.

50:08.733 --> 50:10.833
- I'm really scared, okay.

50:10.833 --> 50:12.367
- You're safe with us.

50:12.367 --> 50:14.567
Nothing's going to happen
as long as we're together.

50:14.567 --> 50:15.400
Come on.

50:17.900 --> 50:21.067
It's okay we're safe together.

50:53.100 --> 50:53.900
- Sarah.

50:58.433 --> 50:59.500
- The spirit

51:02.133 --> 51:02.967
is here.

51:05.267 --> 51:07.000
- Sarah, don't shit us.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.333
This is getting weird.

51:18.567 --> 51:23.133
- She is all around me.

51:40.033 --> 51:42.700
There is nobody to be scared of.

51:44.567 --> 51:45.800
Nothing at all.

51:56.867 --> 51:57.833
It's so calm.

52:02.067 --> 52:04.067
She likes us being here.

52:07.233 --> 52:08.333
She needs us.

52:10.333 --> 52:11.433
She needs us.

52:15.867 --> 52:16.733
I can show you.

52:18.333 --> 52:20.533
Mary, wants us to
connect with her again.

52:20.533 --> 52:22.367
- Sarah, are you crazy, no.

52:22.367 --> 52:23.200
- Rachel.

52:25.167 --> 52:26.300
Think of a color.

52:27.667 --> 52:28.500
- Yeah, alright.

52:30.367 --> 52:33.267
- Mary, what is the color?

52:44.033 --> 52:44.867
Green.

52:46.667 --> 52:48.867
Were you thinking of green?

52:50.733 --> 52:54.567
- That's weird how
did you know that?

52:54.567 --> 52:56.033
- I didn't it was Mary.

52:56.033 --> 52:58.733
- Yeah, right everyone
thinks of green.

52:58.733 --> 53:00.433
- No, I choose red.

53:01.300 --> 53:04.267
- Frankie, it could be anything.

53:04.267 --> 53:06.267
Okay, think of a flower.

53:07.700 --> 53:08.500
- Okay.

53:09.833 --> 53:11.167
- What is the flower.

53:18.933 --> 53:19.767
- Rose.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.000
- Hey, that's so freaky.

53:23.067 --> 53:24.200
I thought of a tulip,

53:25.567 --> 53:27.167
but then I had to change my mind

53:28.600 --> 53:30.767
like I had no choice.

53:30.767 --> 53:32.100
- Mary, wants to play

53:36.033 --> 53:37.233
tarot.

53:37.233 --> 53:38.400
- I don't know
how to play tarot.

53:39.900 --> 53:40.733
- I'll show you.

53:46.800 --> 53:49.300
Just think of a
card as I do this.

53:53.400 --> 53:55.000
- It's too fast I can't see one.

53:55.967 --> 53:56.833
- Try again.

54:03.633 --> 54:04.467
Got one.

54:13.400 --> 54:14.667
What is the card?

54:24.867 --> 54:27.333
- What card did
you pick, Victoria?

54:27.333 --> 54:28.167
- The Fool.

54:33.233 --> 54:34.433
- Okay, where is Mary?

54:36.533 --> 54:40.733
- Here.

54:40.733 --> 54:41.667
She's here.

54:46.267 --> 54:47.100
- Sarah.

54:48.300 --> 54:49.533
- You okay?

54:56.800 --> 54:58.167
- Yeah, I'm fine.

55:01.200 --> 55:02.667
- You keep going somewhere else.

55:02.667 --> 55:04.400
I don't know what's going on.

55:05.600 --> 55:07.633
- We've had enough
of this board.

55:07.633 --> 55:10.500
Okay, everyone needs to
just chill out and relax.

55:10.500 --> 55:12.433
Okay, come on enough.

55:40.933 --> 55:41.767
- Frankie.

55:45.133 --> 55:47.867
I'm getting a really
strong message from Mary.

55:52.767 --> 55:54.900
She wants you to regress

55:54.900 --> 55:57.667
to go back to when you were
four or five years old.

55:59.933 --> 56:02.933
You were sitting at a
table by a warm fire.

56:05.600 --> 56:08.967
In front of you is a sheet of
white paper and some crayons.

56:11.500 --> 56:13.867
Mary, wants you
to draw a picture.

56:15.400 --> 56:17.167
- That's crazy.

56:17.167 --> 56:18.400
What?

56:18.400 --> 56:21.800
- Just draw what
you feel is safe.

56:47.633 --> 56:48.933
- I don't know understand.

56:51.400 --> 56:53.133
How did you know?

56:53.133 --> 56:54.967
- The same way you did.

56:54.967 --> 56:57.933
This picture wasn't ours,
Frankie, it's Mary's.

57:00.033 --> 57:01.267
She's here with us.

57:02.767 --> 57:04.633
- Is she trying to
tell us something?

57:05.833 --> 57:07.233
- It's of the cabin.

57:27.867 --> 57:28.700
- Sarah.

57:30.300 --> 57:31.900
What really happened back there?

57:33.567 --> 57:35.033
- What do you think happened?

57:35.900 --> 57:37.767
- I don't know.

57:37.767 --> 57:42.067
I saw the picture so strong
in my mind, so vivid.

57:42.067 --> 57:42.900
It's like

57:44.467 --> 57:45.733
someone got into my head.

58:03.600 --> 58:04.767
- Someone did.

58:08.333 --> 58:09.900
- Is anyone hungry?

58:41.233 --> 58:43.233
Oh, my god I am stuffed.

58:45.333 --> 58:46.367
- I can eat more.

58:46.367 --> 58:47.200
- Really.

58:47.200 --> 58:48.400
- No.

58:48.400 --> 58:49.567
- Seriously does
anyone want anymore?

58:49.567 --> 58:50.500
- No, I'm full.

58:50.500 --> 58:51.900
- No, that was so good though.

58:51.900 --> 58:53.433
Where did you learn
to cook like that?

58:53.433 --> 58:54.667
- From my mom.

58:55.867 --> 58:57.200
- Yeah, the Italian
bit of her I guess.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.567
- The pasta was so good.

59:00.100 --> 59:02.900
- That was bad right,
bad Italian, sorry.

59:02.900 --> 59:04.433
- Guys we shouldn't
have done it.

59:06.100 --> 59:06.933
- What?

59:06.933 --> 59:08.433
- The Ouija board.

59:08.433 --> 59:11.200
- Victoria, come on.

59:11.200 --> 59:12.767
Do you not realize
that we have just

59:12.767 --> 59:15.867
connected with someone
from the other side.

59:15.867 --> 59:17.067
- I'm not sorry I did it.

59:17.067 --> 59:18.400
- Yeah, neither am I.

59:18.400 --> 59:21.200
Think about it nothing
bad has happened.

59:21.200 --> 59:24.167
- Yeah, I don't know why
you're so riled up about it.

59:24.167 --> 59:28.433
- What if she's still
here with us, Mary?

59:30.200 --> 59:31.500
- Should we find out?

59:31.500 --> 59:32.467
- No.

59:32.467 --> 59:34.800
- Shall we?
- Come on.

59:34.800 --> 59:36.333
- No thank you.

59:36.333 --> 59:37.367
- Suit yourself.

59:41.033 --> 59:42.167
- Fine.

59:43.233 --> 59:44.267
I'll get the lights.

59:51.433 --> 59:53.000
- Well, don't do it without me.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.267
- Is there anybody here with us?

01:00:19.967 --> 01:00:20.900
Show yourself.

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.200
- How did she die?

01:00:31.333 --> 01:00:32.167
- Ask her.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.300
- Mary,

01:00:38.633 --> 01:00:39.633
how did you die?

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.233
Drowned.

01:01:00.633 --> 01:01:01.433
She drowned.

01:01:04.367 --> 01:01:05.767
Did you drown in the lake?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.133
Was it an accident?

01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:18.233
- Who else is here, Mary?

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:28.167
- Heis?

01:01:29.433 --> 01:01:31.433
Some sort of name maybe.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.067
- No.

01:01:34.067 --> 01:01:36.667
He is it's two words.

01:01:36.667 --> 01:01:37.867
Maybe she means the
one who killed her.

01:01:37.867 --> 01:01:38.700
- Shit.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.567
- Is that
what you mean, Mary?

01:01:48.967 --> 01:01:49.767
- G.

01:01:51.133 --> 01:01:51.933
O.

01:01:53.233 --> 01:01:54.033
Go.

01:01:55.567 --> 01:01:56.800
What does she mean go like

01:01:58.167 --> 01:02:01.533
like we should go or
she's going or what?

01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:06.867
- Maybe this isn't real, okay.

01:02:07.967 --> 01:02:10.233
Maybe we wanted to
believe it, made it up.

01:02:11.933 --> 01:02:13.400
We're scaring each
other so much.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.700
Just we need to stop.

01:02:16.067 --> 01:02:17.300
- Or maybe it is real,

01:02:19.167 --> 01:02:22.733
and maybe what she
says about him is true

01:02:23.833 --> 01:02:25.467
and he's here.

01:02:35.433 --> 01:02:36.333
- You okay?

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.300
- I'm fine.

01:03:39.867 --> 01:03:40.833
- Frankie.

01:03:41.733 --> 01:03:42.933
Frankie, are you alright?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:44.867
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.033
It was just a nightmare.

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.533
- Victoria, are you okay?

01:04:11.533 --> 01:04:12.367
Oh, my god.

01:04:16.633 --> 01:04:18.533
Why don't I go get
some hot chocolate.

01:04:20.633 --> 01:04:21.467
Frankie.

01:04:22.867 --> 01:04:23.700
- It's okay.

01:04:24.633 --> 01:04:27.333
Look at me it was a dream, okay.

01:05:01.367 --> 01:05:02.200
- Rachel.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.200
Rachel, what's wrong.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.033
Oh.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.700
What is happening?

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.267
- Guys.
- What?

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:19.667
- There's a light
on in the outhouse.

01:05:29.667 --> 01:05:31.233
- Why is she going
outside by herself?

01:05:31.233 --> 01:05:32.467
- I don't know.

01:06:14.733 --> 01:06:17.833
- It's Frankie probably
one of her dumb jokes.

01:06:17.833 --> 01:06:19.633
- Yeah, but what
if it isn't, Sarah.

01:06:23.767 --> 01:06:24.633
Frankie.

01:06:29.233 --> 01:06:30.067
- Frankie.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.467
Frankie, where are you?

01:06:37.467 --> 01:06:39.667
- Great the flashlight's broken.

01:06:39.667 --> 01:06:42.400
You know what Frankie if this
is a joke it's not funny.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.833
Frankie.

01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:47.667
Frankie.

01:06:49.933 --> 01:06:50.900
She's nowhere to be found.

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.033
We need to get help.

01:06:52.033 --> 01:06:53.067
- How are we
supposed to do that?

01:06:53.067 --> 01:06:54.967
- Keep it together, Victoria.

01:06:54.967 --> 01:06:56.167
We need to be strong.

01:06:56.167 --> 01:06:57.167
- Frankie, may come back.

01:06:57.167 --> 01:06:58.633
Maybe she just she got lost.

01:06:58.633 --> 01:07:00.600
- Between the cabin and
the outhouse, Victoria.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.533
I don't think so.

01:07:01.533 --> 01:07:02.867
- Well, where is she then?

01:07:02.867 --> 01:07:04.100
- I don't know.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.467
- Guys, there's no point
in scaring each other.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.867
- This all started when we
played that fucking Ouija board.

01:07:14.867 --> 01:07:16.267
We should've never done it.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.633
Your stupid filming, Sarah

01:07:19.633 --> 01:07:21.333
all for your little project.

01:07:21.333 --> 01:07:22.867
- Don't be like that okay
it's not Sarah's fault.

01:07:22.867 --> 01:07:23.833
- Well, then who's fault is it?

01:07:23.833 --> 01:07:25.167
- It's nobody's fault.

01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:27.000
- Well, she organized
all of this.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.633
It was her crap idea.

01:07:30.767 --> 01:07:31.967
- I'm so sorry, Rachel.

01:07:33.733 --> 01:07:36.100
I didn't think anything
like this would happen.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.667
- We need to contact her.

01:07:44.667 --> 01:07:46.567
- How are we gonna do that.

01:07:46.567 --> 01:07:47.900
We don't know where she is?

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:49.600
- I'm talking about Mary.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.067
- You cannot be serious.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.300
- I have never
been more serious.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:55.600
This is really,
really bad karma.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.833
But she's our best
bet to find Frankie.

01:08:13.533 --> 01:08:14.867
Are you with us?

01:08:19.332 --> 01:08:21.832
- I don't think I
can do this, okay.

01:08:26.733 --> 01:08:27.567
- Okay.

01:08:33.233 --> 01:08:34.867
Spirit, are you with us?

01:08:35.966 --> 01:08:36.800
Show us a sign.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:47.767
Is this, Mary?

01:08:56.367 --> 01:08:58.767
Do you know where Frankie is?

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:02.667
- Where is she?

01:09:18.767 --> 01:09:20.399
- He's here?

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:21.600
Who is here, Mary?

01:09:29.433 --> 01:09:30.267
Sarah.

01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:32.367
Sarah.

01:09:33.767 --> 01:09:34.600
- Lonely.

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.267
What happened?

01:09:42.966 --> 01:09:44.033
- Your voice went all funny.

01:09:44.033 --> 01:09:47.033
You sounded different?

01:09:47.033 --> 01:09:49.733
- Don't you remember anything?

01:09:49.733 --> 01:09:51.867
- We were contacting
Mary, right?

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.067
- We did she was here.

01:10:01.433 --> 01:10:02.767
- We just need to get
out of here, okay.

01:10:02.767 --> 01:10:04.100
We just need to go to the car,

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.600
and we need to drive
and get some help.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.200
- If we make it to the main
road, we'll get a signal.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.400
- Sarah, are you okay to drive?

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.400
- No, she doesn't
look good I'll drive.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.500
- Oh, my god.

01:10:17.867 --> 01:10:19.400
- Sarah, come on.

01:10:25.267 --> 01:10:27.433
Take the candle, Victoria.

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.733
Come on get in.

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.633
- Rachel, pressed button.
- It's not working.

01:10:39.167 --> 01:10:42.067
- Stop you're gonna
flood the engine.

01:10:44.333 --> 01:10:46.133
- It's not gonna start.

01:10:46.133 --> 01:10:47.733
- My god what are we gonna do.

01:10:47.733 --> 01:10:49.800
- Okay, we can try
walking to the main road,

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.467
or we go back inside and
we wait until it's light.

01:10:51.467 --> 01:10:53.233
- It's too dark outside, guys.

01:10:53.233 --> 01:10:54.833
We're gonna get lost.

01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:57.500
We have to go back
in there, Rachel.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:00.233
- Okay, you're right.

01:11:00.233 --> 01:11:03.300
Victoria, we have
to be strong, okay.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.633
Do you hear me?

01:11:20.033 --> 01:11:21.867
- Guys, we closed the door.

01:11:21.867 --> 01:11:23.467
- Maybe the wind blew it open.

01:11:23.467 --> 01:11:28.467
- What are you doing come on.

01:11:42.333 --> 01:11:43.133
- Frankie.

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:46.567
Frankie, is that you?

01:12:00.467 --> 01:12:02.533
- Who switched on the TV.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.167
- She's not here.

01:12:06.167 --> 01:12:08.000
- Oh, my god, oh, my god.

01:12:10.633 --> 01:12:13.467
- Hey, Victoria, we're just
gonna wait till daylight, okay.

01:12:13.467 --> 01:12:15.400
It's only a couple of hours,

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.333
and then I'll try the car again,

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.100
and if doesn't start we'll
just walk to the main road

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:20.733
and get help, okay.

01:12:23.033 --> 01:12:23.867
- Rachel.

01:12:25.033 --> 01:12:25.867
- What.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.067
- Mary's here.

01:12:31.533 --> 01:12:33.033
I can feel her.

01:12:33.033 --> 01:12:35.133
- Okay, Victoria, we really
don't need this right now.

01:12:35.133 --> 01:12:36.767
Look at me.

01:12:36.767 --> 01:12:39.500
You have to remain calm
until we get help, okay.

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.533
- Okay.

01:12:41.533 --> 01:12:42.833
- It's just the wind.

01:12:42.833 --> 01:12:44.133
It's just the wind.

01:12:44.133 --> 01:12:45.933
- It's just the wind.

01:12:45.933 --> 01:12:46.767
- Sarah.

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:49.700
- What?

01:12:56.033 --> 01:12:56.900
- Sarah.

01:13:07.567 --> 01:13:08.400
Sarah.

01:13:12.467 --> 01:13:13.300
Sarah.

01:13:41.133 --> 01:13:42.800
- Did you find her?
- No.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.267
- Where is she then?

01:13:47.933 --> 01:13:49.700
- Where
the hell were you?

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:52.600
- Downstairs.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.533
- No, you weren't.

01:13:54.833 --> 01:13:57.233
I checked where were you, Sarah?

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.533
Sarah.

01:14:06.667 --> 01:14:07.533
Where were you?

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:15.433
- I told you.

01:14:15.433 --> 01:14:16.600
- Why are you lying?

01:14:18.133 --> 01:14:19.400
- Rachel.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.333
- Okay, I'll go try the car.

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:23.400
- Should I stay with Sarah?
- I don't think you should.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.600
You should come with me.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.867
- Sarah, are you coming.
- Victoria.

01:14:26.867 --> 01:14:30.233
- Sarah, please come.
- Victoria, come on.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.000
Oh, let me get the cellphone
I left it upstairs.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.033
- Sarah.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.567
- Start damn you, start.

01:15:08.967 --> 01:15:09.800
- Rachel.

01:15:11.067 --> 01:15:11.900
Sarah.

01:15:22.033 --> 01:15:27.033
* Twinkle, twinkle little star

01:15:27.933 --> 01:15:32.267
* How I wonder what you are

01:15:33.033 --> 01:15:35.567
* Up above the world

01:16:32.067 --> 01:16:33.733
- You need to relax.

01:17:02.133 --> 01:17:05.233
I'll take care of you.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:14.800
* Twinkle, twinkle little star

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:18.767
* How I wonder what you are

01:18:42.367 --> 01:18:43.200
- Mary.

01:18:46.933 --> 01:18:50.833
Is that you, Mary.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.400
Who

01:19:20.267 --> 01:19:21.333
is

01:19:22.867 --> 01:19:23.867

01:20:07.033 --> 01:20:08.200
Where is Mary?

01:20:19.767 --> 01:20:21.233
Gone.

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:22.067
Gone.

01:20:27.433 --> 01:20:28.433
Who's there?
