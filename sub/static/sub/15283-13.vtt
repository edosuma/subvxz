00:01.430 --> 00:05.410
We appeal to him, do
not hurt any more people.

00:05.430 --> 00:08.320
He killed those people
because of something I said.

00:08.360 --> 00:11.980
That is part of the job. Tell
me now if you can do it or not.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.810
Jordan?

00:18.830 --> 00:21.830
He just killed his entire family.

00:21.860 --> 00:23.780
Is this my fault?

00:23.800 --> 00:25.280
No way.

00:25.310 --> 00:28.090
I'm not sure I can do this job.

00:38.650 --> 00:41.690
Oh, it's up there, on the right.

00:51.110 --> 00:53.650
Come on, son, it's time.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.520
I know you're awake.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.360
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:00.370 --> 01:02.960
There's something on your
mind. Tell us what it is.

01:04.680 --> 01:07.710
What if she doesn't like me?

01:08.030 --> 01:10.310
Let her get to know you.

01:10.330 --> 01:12.150
There's no rush.

01:12.170 --> 01:15.120
Is that really what
you're worried about?

01:15.940 --> 01:17.540
Do I have to meet her this way?

01:17.550 --> 01:20.500
We've been talking about
this moment your whole life.

01:20.510 --> 01:21.790
I know.

01:21.800 --> 01:25.260
Baby, look at me. You're almost 10.

01:25.270 --> 01:27.610
You're becoming a man.

01:28.100 --> 01:30.140
I love you.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.690
I love you, too.

01:46.090 --> 01:47.710
Come on.

02:42.370 --> 02:45.150
- What was it?
- Excuse me.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.810
This isn't good.

02:50.180 --> 02:51.520
We have a request from alabama.

02:51.540 --> 02:53.600
Have everybody meet in the conference
room. I'll be there in 10 minutes.

02:53.610 --> 02:56.130
A husband and wife were murdered at
their home while they were sleeping.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.500
Their 10-year-old
daughter went missing.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.310
I gotta call you back.

02:59.340 --> 03:01.150
- When were the bodies discovered?
- Less than an hour ago.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.490
- What was the time of death?
- Approximately 1 A.M.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.130
- 8 hours.
- I know this isn't a serial.

03:05.140 --> 03:08.630
You're right. Most abducted children
don't survive past the first 24 hours.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.840
- Dave.
- What's going on?

03:13.850 --> 03:15.910
We got a missing 10-year-old
girl, home invasion.

03:15.930 --> 03:16.920
Parents were killed in their sleep.

03:16.950 --> 03:18.330
- Where's our clock?
- 8 hours and counting.

03:18.340 --> 03:19.800
I'll find Morgan and Reid and
tell them we're on the move.

03:19.810 --> 03:21.720
Good. Wheels-up in 30.

03:23.710 --> 03:27.440
You need your go bag. Jordan?

03:28.330 --> 03:30.600
Right. Right.

03:43.160 --> 03:49.170
Please let me go. Let me
go. I won't tell. Please.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.210
It's ok.

03:56.220 --> 03:58.940
We talked about this.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.120
Are you--are
you thirsty?

04:05.150 --> 04:06.130
Please don't hurt me.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.810
It's only water.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.680
Can I decide now?

04:26.690 --> 04:29.350
It's up to you.

04:29.360 --> 04:33.010
I'm gonna call you... Elena.

Winston churchill said, "there is no doubt
that it is around the family and the home

05:10.970 --> 05:16.470
That all the greatest virtues of human society"
are created, strengthened, and maintained."

05:18.090 --> 05:22.160
We got the uplinks of
the crime scene photos.

05:24.250 --> 05:27.550
This is Geoff and Nancy Hale.
Both their throats were cut.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.370
- Any evidence of abuse?
- Nothing.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.770
Slitting someone's throat
is quick and efficient.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.060
That's because the real
target was down the hall.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.090
- She has a name.
- What?

05:36.100 --> 05:40.060
She's not "the target." Her
name's Cate. She's 10 years old.

05:41.930 --> 05:44.210
All right.

05:44.220 --> 05:46.060
Amber alert in effect?

05:46.100 --> 05:47.650
Since 7 A.M.this morning.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.620
With the unsub's head start he could
be anywhere within a 400-mile radius.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.730
- Make sure that they're casting a widenough net.
- Got it.

05:52.740 --> 05:53.820
Who discovered the bodies?

05:53.840 --> 05:56.310
Jim Scheuren, Cate's biological father.

05:56.340 --> 05:57.880
He was supposed to take
her for the weekend.

05:57.910 --> 05:59.550
The police don't consider him a suspect.

05:59.580 --> 06:01.040
We'll want to talk to him anyway.

06:01.050 --> 06:04.660
We're also going to need a list of
registered sex offenders in a 20-mile radius.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.470
What's the makeup of
the Hales' neighborhood?

06:06.490 --> 06:08.880
Mostly white and middle class.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.520
We'll need aerial views
of the neighborhood.

06:10.540 --> 06:12.830
If madison county doesn't
have them, talk to Garcia.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.260
Dave, you and Morgan
go to the crime scene.

06:14.290 --> 06:17.230
The rest of us will get up
to speed at the precinct.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.640
<i>HARVEST,ALABAMA</i>

06:34.100 --> 06:35.190
Bo whitaker.

06:35.210 --> 06:36.230
David Rossi.

06:36.250 --> 06:38.170
I recognize you from the tv.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.820
- Derek Morgan.
- Bo whitaker. Pleased to meet you.

06:40.830 --> 06:43.280
Point of entry's around back.

06:43.290 --> 06:46.090
Now, the neighbors didn't
see or hear anything.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.690
And the dogs lost the
scent almost immediately.

06:48.710 --> 06:50.620
Not hard to target a family out here.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.330
Even in broad daylight.

06:52.350 --> 06:55.920
Walk 5 feet off the track,
man could get lost for days.

06:55.930 --> 07:00.480
So, he had plenty of privacy to
watch what he was really after.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.100
I prefer cities.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.500
You can see them coming.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.770
Nothing very sophisticated.

07:21.130 --> 07:24.260
Knocked off the pane to unlock the door.

07:26.140 --> 07:27.980
Do you think the girl's dead?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.280
Depends on what he took her for.

07:30.300 --> 07:34.320
The Hales' neighborhood is a series
of rural roads and one-block streets.

07:34.340 --> 07:35.520
How far to a main thoroughfare?

07:35.540 --> 07:36.780
A little over 3 miles.

07:36.810 --> 07:38.470
So he didn't come upon Cate by accident.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.880
- Sheriff Bates.
- Yes.

07:39.890 --> 07:41.250
Is Cate's father here yet?

07:41.260 --> 07:42.200
He's on his way.

07:42.230 --> 07:43.710
Let me know the second he gets here.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.690
I told you, we already
checked out his alibi.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.570
He's not good for this.

07:46.580 --> 07:49.060
- I know, but he might know who is.
- All right.

08:04.990 --> 08:06.440
Is that the autopsy report?

08:06.450 --> 08:09.810
- Listen, about the plane-- -
oh, that's already forgotten.

08:14.270 --> 08:15.680
Find anything in Cate's room?

08:15.720 --> 08:18.110
That's what's weird.
There's no sign of struggle.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.090
It didn't even look like she
tried to get out of bed in a hurry.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.600
Her parents' throats were cut.

08:21.640 --> 08:25.760
If there was the element of surprise,
they might not have had time to scream.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.360
Both of them?

08:27.370 --> 08:28.300
What are you looking for?

08:28.320 --> 08:30.980
The neck wounds--
something's off.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.280
I'm the unsub. I kill geoff Hale first.

08:34.289 --> 08:36.020
He presents the biggest threat.

08:36.059 --> 08:40.299
But how do I do that without waking
nancy who's sleeping right next to him?

08:40.320 --> 08:42.260
No ligature marks.
Neither one was tied down.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.210
And no defensive wounds, either.

08:44.240 --> 08:49.020
Geoff Hale--cause of death was a single deep,
smooth cut that severed the carotid artery.

08:49.050 --> 08:49.850
And nancy?

08:49.870 --> 08:52.680
Nancy Hale--death was
caused by a series of jagged,

08:52.720 --> 08:55.380
Shallow wounds that
punctured the carotid artery.

08:55.390 --> 08:58.370
- There's more than one unsub.
- You're sure?

08:58.380 --> 09:02.040
He was either able to restrain nancy
while he killed geoff, or she woke up,

09:02.070 --> 09:03.160
Which means she would have screamed.

09:03.190 --> 09:05.320
At which point, Cate
would have woken up.

09:05.350 --> 09:06.990
Either way, we're looking
at multiple unsubs.

09:07.020 --> 09:09.180
So things are worse than we thought.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.470
Yes and no.

09:10.490 --> 09:12.440
Cate's chances of
survival just got better.

09:12.470 --> 09:13.500
How do you figure?

09:13.510 --> 09:15.180
Two unsubs change the dynamics.

09:15.210 --> 09:16.710
What do you mean, dynamics?

09:16.740 --> 09:19.070
They spent more time with her.

09:20.540 --> 09:23.650
Yeah, Prentiss has the same
theory based on the autopsy report.

09:23.660 --> 09:26.060
Right. We're about to speak to
Cate's father. Stay at the scene.

09:26.070 --> 09:28.000
- I'll call you the second i'm out.
- Dad's in there.

09:28.010 --> 09:30.580
Sheriff, alert your men.
We may be looking at a team.

09:30.590 --> 09:33.110
I'll get it on the wire.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.210
How's the father?

09:34.230 --> 09:38.160
Between you and me, i've cleaned up bar
fights smell better than he does right now.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.800
Mr. Scheuren. I'm aaron
hohner. I'm with the fbi.

09:47.810 --> 09:49.930
Can I get you anything? Coffee?

09:50.580 --> 09:53.190
No, no. I can answer your questions.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.400
Do you know if your ex-wife and
her husband have any enemies?

09:56.410 --> 09:59.380
No. I mean, I don't know.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.370
I don't--i
don't know.I--

10:01.380 --> 10:04.730
what about Cate? Has she talked
about anyone new in her life?

10:05.320 --> 10:08.690
She's a normal kid, you know?
She... Meets people all the time.

10:08.700 --> 10:11.060
This would be an adult,
possibly a white male.

10:11.090 --> 10:13.470
He might be an authority figure to her.

10:13.490 --> 10:16.880
The reason that I ask is that given
the location of your ex-wife's house,

10:16.910 --> 10:19.930
We think someone has
targed Cate specifically.

10:23.750 --> 10:24.570
Sorry.

10:24.600 --> 10:28.440
Well, is there anything that you
can think of that might be helpful?

10:29.440 --> 10:32.700
We like to go to the movies.

10:32.710 --> 10:36.510
There's a new, uh,
multiplex at the mall.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.720
How often to you see Cate?

10:38.740 --> 10:41.150
I have visitation every 2 weeks.

10:41.170 --> 10:43.340
Do you keep to that schedule?

10:43.350 --> 10:46.010
The reason that I ask is that
right now time is of the essence.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.460
What's that supposed to mean?

10:47.470 --> 10:50.880
With all due respect, sir, it means that
if you can't add to my knowledge of Cate,

10:50.890 --> 10:53.130
My time is better spent somewhere else.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.290
I'll keep you posted
with any developments.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.130
- Agent--
- Yes?

10:58.430 --> 11:01.940
- there's one thing-- - hold
on a second.I'm right here.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.540
Hotch, I got it.

11:06.580 --> 11:09.420
Ok, bring it with you when you
come to the station. Thanks.

11:09.430 --> 11:10.450
What's going on?

11:10.470 --> 11:14.660
Cate Hale has epilepsy, and whoever abducted
her didn't know to take the medicine.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.970
And the primary cause
of seizures is stress.

11:25.690 --> 11:27.680
- Remember what I said.
- I know, dad.

11:27.690 --> 11:30.660
Just concentrate. He shouldn't
even realize you're there.

11:30.670 --> 11:32.430
I know.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.030
Go ahead.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.980
Chin up. This isn't
something you learn overnight.

11:41.990 --> 11:43.440
I'm ready now.

11:43.450 --> 11:46.050
You need to master it here first.

11:46.070 --> 11:48.070
Now try it again.

11:53.110 --> 11:56.420
- No, no! Don't touch her.
- What's wrong with her?

11:56.430 --> 11:58.150
- Can you hear me?
- Don't go near her.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.670
- She's sick.
- She's no good.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.890
We have to do something.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.090
You're right.

12:09.810 --> 12:12.330
We don't kill young girls.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.710
This is my family.

12:19.210 --> 12:21.740
Then you kill her.

13:44.330 --> 13:48.260
Help! Help! Somebody!

13:58.490 --> 13:59.420
Her father's with her.

13:59.450 --> 14:01.980
She's been in and out of consciousness,
but her vitals are stable.

14:02.010 --> 14:03.080
Any sign of sexual assault?

14:03.100 --> 14:05.430
We haven't tested yet. We want
to give her time to process.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.790
May we speak with her?

14:06.820 --> 14:09.760
You should know, seizures often
come with retrograde amnesia.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.990
She might have holes in her memory.

14:13.180 --> 14:15.930
- Prentiss, you should do this alone.
- Ok.

14:18.930 --> 14:21.130
Thanks, sheriff.

14:21.450 --> 14:23.760
Mr. Scheuren, hello.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.080
I'm agent Emily Prentiss from the fbi.

14:26.110 --> 14:28.280
I would like permission to
speak with your daughter.

14:28.290 --> 14:30.320
Ok.

14:30.580 --> 14:32.910
I'm sorry, i'd like to
do it alone if possible.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.020
Why?

14:34.040 --> 14:40.530
I need to ask her certain questions, and sometimes
it's easier for a girl to answer those questions

14:40.540 --> 14:42.070
- When there are no men present.
- I'm her father.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.830
Daddy. Please?

14:47.200 --> 14:49.340
All right, baby.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.980
- I'll be right outside.
- Thank you.

14:55.350 --> 14:59.550
Hey, Cate. My name's Emily.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.420
I'm so sorry about your
mom and your stepdad.

15:04.630 --> 15:09.820
I'd like to ask you some questions
so we can find out who di is that ok?

15:09.830 --> 15:12.290
Yeah, it's ok.

15:12.300 --> 15:15.560
The doctor told me that if the paramedics
hadn't been alerted to her epilepsy,

15:15.570 --> 15:17.640
she might not have made it.

15:17.660 --> 15:20.410
You helped save her life.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.760
You seen this kind of thing before?

15:22.780 --> 15:24.170
Unfortunately.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.270
And kids come out of it ok, huh?

15:26.280 --> 15:31.090
It'll take time. And patience.
She's going to need you.

15:31.490 --> 15:35.900
Yesterday would have been the first
time i'd seen her in a month and a half.

15:38.440 --> 15:42.430
A colleague of mine asked me the other day how my
son was enjoying the christmas present he got for him,

15:42.460 --> 15:45.940
And I had to make up an
answer because I didn't know.

15:49.220 --> 15:52.150
I think i'll get that cup of coffee now.

15:53.740 --> 15:56.760
The police sent the blanket and
Cate's clothing to be processed.

15:56.770 --> 15:58.590
Good.

16:01.110 --> 16:01.850
Garcia.

16:01.870 --> 16:02.960
Oh, captain, my captain.

16:02.970 --> 16:08.370
I need a list of crimes involving partners within
a 90-mile radius of harvest in the last 2 years.

16:08.380 --> 16:09.590
- All crimes?
- Anything.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.800
Violent crimes, break-ins,
whatever's in the system.

16:11.820 --> 16:13.710
I need to be able to
show Cate some mugshots.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.570
You got it. One scumbag
yearbook coming up.

16:16.580 --> 16:18.280
So you think they're local?

16:18.290 --> 16:20.630
They dumped Cate 84 miles from her home.

16:20.650 --> 16:23.310
The sheriff who found her didn't
think that she'd been there long.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.750
With the unsubs' head start,
they should have been long gone.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.960
So we're zeroing in on them.

16:28.590 --> 16:30.920
- Possibly.
- Then what's wrong?

16:30.930 --> 16:33.070
I don't know why they left her alive.

16:33.090 --> 16:36.630
I'm going to do what's
called a cognitive interview.

16:36.640 --> 16:40.930
It's as much about the things
you sensed as the things you saw.

16:40.940 --> 16:42.080
I'm scared.

16:42.090 --> 16:44.280
I know. That's ok.

16:44.290 --> 16:47.560
I'm right here with you.
I'm here all the way.

16:48.610 --> 16:51.540
Now, I need you to close your eyes.

16:52.490 --> 16:53.860
Ok.

16:53.900 --> 16:57.580
What is the first thing you remember?

17:01.190 --> 17:03.770
It's cold.

17:06.990 --> 17:10.560
You're outside? Who's there?

17:10.569 --> 17:13.480
- A man.He told me
to-- - keep quiet.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.079
- What is he doing?
- He's holding my hand. It hurts.

17:16.089 --> 17:17.450
He's waiting for something.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.339
What does he look like?

17:19.349 --> 17:20.300
I don't want to be here.

17:20.329 --> 17:22.619
He can't hurt you, I
promise. I'm right here.

17:22.630 --> 17:25.530
Tall. Dark hair. Old.

17:25.540 --> 17:28.970
- Old? Old like me?
- Old like my dad.

17:28.980 --> 17:30.770
Is anyone else there?

17:30.810 --> 17:36.120
Someone's coming! Emily!
Emily! Emily, help me!

17:36.130 --> 17:38.140
- Open the trunk!
- Please help me!

17:38.150 --> 17:40.430
Ok, it's ok. I'm right here.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.090
I promise you he cannot hurt you.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.840
It's ok. It's ok.

17:48.670 --> 17:50.960
So he put you in the trunk of the car?

17:50.990 --> 17:54.750
- Open the trunk!
- No!

17:59.820 --> 18:04.090
- How long were you in there?
- I don't know. Not long.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.280
10 minutes.

18:05.300 --> 18:08.620
Was the ride bumpy or smooth?

18:08.630 --> 18:10.030
It was smooth.

18:10.050 --> 18:13.140
I wanted to scream, but
no sound would come out.

18:13.150 --> 18:14.660
It's ok.

18:14.680 --> 18:19.390
So the car stops, and they open
the trunk. What do you hear?

18:20.010 --> 18:22.700
Wind. Wind through the trees.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.600
And what do you smell?

18:24.620 --> 18:26.630
Cooking.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.060
Are you inside now?

18:28.070 --> 18:29.820
They've taken my shoes off.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.640
That's so you won't run.

18:31.670 --> 18:36.730
I want you to look down at your feet
and tell me what you're standing on.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.230
Carpet.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.630
I'm in a little room.

18:41.660 --> 18:43.960
With clothes and tinfoil all around me.

18:43.970 --> 18:45.220
What else?

18:45.240 --> 18:47.680
I--i hear
bells.

18:47.690 --> 18:49.450
What kind of bells?

18:49.480 --> 18:52.120
Small. Like a fairy.

18:52.130 --> 18:55.640
Every time they ring, the
man says something to the boy.

18:55.650 --> 18:57.570
The boy?

18:57.580 --> 19:00.490
He's standing right next to you.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.420
How old is he?

19:02.440 --> 19:04.940
I'm 9. Almost 10.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.340
Puyule, come here.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.690
His parents want me to play with him.

19:10.710 --> 19:11.930
His parents?

19:11.960 --> 19:15.110
Emily, I don't want to
go. I don't want to go. No!

19:15.120 --> 19:18.890
Don't make me go!
Emily, no! Emily! Emily!

19:18.900 --> 19:22.970
It's ok, i'm right
here. It's ok. It's ok.

19:24.130 --> 19:27.030
Cate, open your eyes.

19:28.030 --> 19:32.400
You did a really good job. Ok.

19:35.270 --> 19:39.020
Mr. Scheuren, you have an
incredibly strong little girl.

19:39.850 --> 19:40.980
Did he touch her?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.280
No, no. Not in that way, no.

19:43.290 --> 19:45.240
Thank god.

19:48.010 --> 19:50.640
She was taken by a family.

19:50.660 --> 19:51.560
A family?

19:51.580 --> 19:54.240
Parents and a little boy about her age.

19:54.270 --> 19:57.490
They took her from her house
in a car and then into an rv.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.220
A short ride on a road and
then into a wooded area.

20:00.230 --> 20:01.390
She say anything else?

20:01.420 --> 20:06.690
She said the mother called the boy puyule,
which I think is a romanian term of endearment.

20:06.710 --> 20:09.580
I know I used to hear it when
my mom was posted overseas.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.380
- Get Rossi and Morgan on the closest rv parks.
- Ok.

20:12.390 --> 20:16.240
- What are we looking at here?
- I have no idea.

20:18.460 --> 20:19.660
Most people pay in cash.

20:19.690 --> 20:21.360
We don't have much
in the way of records.

20:21.380 --> 20:24.260
Ma'am, this was a family--
mother, father, small boy.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.360
They would have kept to
themselves and then left abruptly.

20:26.390 --> 20:28.510
You just described most of my business.

20:28.550 --> 20:30.620
The son wouldn't have
mingled with other children.

20:30.650 --> 20:33.280
He would have been tightly
guarded by his parents.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.700
Sorry. I wish I could help.

20:35.710 --> 20:38.580
The family we're talking
about is eastern european.

20:38.590 --> 20:40.690
They may have spoken some
foreign words to each other.

20:40.730 --> 20:42.150
They in some kind of trouble?

20:42.170 --> 20:43.720
You remember them.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.960
Well, you can imagine I don't get a lot
of people speaking foreign around here.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.530
What can you tell us about them?

20:48.570 --> 20:50.860
Not much. The husband
was real binesslike.

20:50.870 --> 20:53.870
Wife was nice, pretty. Son was quiet.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.480
You didn't take down a
license or a credit card?

20:55.510 --> 20:57.310
Left in the middle of the
night and never came back.

20:57.350 --> 21:01.970
And I wouldn't have thought twice about it if I didn't
have to clean up the campsite from all the glass.

21:02.660 --> 21:04.810
Glass?

21:04.820 --> 21:06.480
All over the ground.

21:06.500 --> 21:07.970
Almost like they did it on purpose.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.630
Can you show us where they parked?

21:14.130 --> 21:16.420
I told you, you're
not gonna find nothin'.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.460
I cleaned it up.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.780
Well, thank you.

21:25.170 --> 21:29.160
Jordan was right, you
know, on the plane.

21:29.550 --> 21:30.390
What are you talking about?

21:30.430 --> 21:32.320
Well, we hide behind language.

21:32.330 --> 21:35.320
We don't talk about the ugliness we see.

21:35.330 --> 21:36.810
Rossi, we talk about it every day.

21:36.840 --> 21:40.550
No. We talk facts.
Signature, m.o., pathology.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.720
What are you getting at?

21:41.750 --> 21:45.390
We're working a case where a family
is grooming their son to kill.

21:45.420 --> 21:46.800
They're not just murdering people.

21:46.830 --> 21:49.800
They're stealing
children, poisoning minds.

21:49.820 --> 21:51.000
Where's the horror?

21:51.020 --> 21:53.810
We can't do this job
if we let it get to us.

21:53.820 --> 21:56.160
Exactly.

21:57.510 --> 21:59.610
Derek.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.350
Is it a match?

22:10.360 --> 22:12.130
Which means the rv park owner was right.

22:12.150 --> 22:13.540
They spread it on purpose.

22:13.570 --> 22:16.280
So everything they do
is part of some ritual.

22:16.290 --> 22:18.310
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

22:18.350 --> 22:20.670
A family that ritualizes
killing together? Definitely not.

22:20.680 --> 22:24.260
You know, if the family speaks romanian,
the spreading of the glass makes sense.

22:24.300 --> 22:26.490
It's an eastern european
superstition for good luck.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.420
So they're romanian.
We already knew that.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.200
Not just romanian.

22:29.220 --> 22:32.650
We're talking about people that are highly
superstitious and obsessed with ritual.

22:32.660 --> 22:34.420
- Romany.
- Romany?

22:34.430 --> 22:35.090
Gypsies.

22:35.150 --> 22:37.960
More accurately, someone who
has perverted romany culture.

22:37.980 --> 22:39.060
Call Garcia.

22:39.090 --> 22:43.110
They're tight-knit and nomadic like our
unsubs, but not usually prone to violence.

22:43.130 --> 22:44.310
Hiya, baby.

22:44.340 --> 22:45.950
Hey, baby girl, we need to talk.

22:45.970 --> 22:47.540
Pg or nc-17?

22:47.560 --> 22:48.900
You're on speakerphone.

22:48.930 --> 22:51.080
I charge extra for groups.

22:51.100 --> 22:55.190
We need you to run through crimes similar
to the Hale murders in the last 2 years.

22:55.210 --> 22:56.720
Oh, I already did that. Zip.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.000
Go back even further, Garcia.

22:58.040 --> 23:01.030
Cross-reference against any small towns
that have had reports of petty theft

23:01.040 --> 23:04.180
associated with waves of romany
populations entering the area.

23:04.190 --> 23:05.860
- Romany?
- Gypsies.

23:05.870 --> 23:07.640
As in "gypsies, tramps, and thieves"?

23:07.650 --> 23:08.510
Exactly.

23:08.540 --> 23:10.670
Oh, bless you all for turning
my life into a cher song.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.360
You'll have it nearly immediately.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.430
You're the best.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.660
You need to get your
men together right now.

23:15.690 --> 23:16.490
Why is that?

23:16.510 --> 23:18.840
'Cause whatever ritual these
people are trying to play out,

23:18.860 --> 23:21.180
We know Cate Hale
didn't fit their needs.

23:21.220 --> 23:23.550
Which means they'll have to try again.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.110
It's too soon.

23:48.130 --> 23:49.830
He turns 10 in a week.

23:49.850 --> 23:52.250
It's not safe.

23:54.370 --> 23:57.120
You see one you like?

24:05.780 --> 24:08.490
She's a fine choice.

24:16.020 --> 24:18.180
The unsubs we're
looking for are a family.

24:18.210 --> 24:21.450
A father, a mother, and a son,
approximately 10 years old.

24:21.470 --> 24:23.580
We believe they're of romanian descent.

24:23.600 --> 24:27.100
The family travels in an rv, but
they also have another vehicle

24:27.120 --> 24:31.120
That they use to go back and
forth between campsites and cities.

24:34.090 --> 24:37.370
We need you to call
every rv park in the area.

24:37.390 --> 24:40.700
Alert the owners to be on the lookout
for a family that fits this description,

24:40.740 --> 24:44.850
As well as a campsite that might
have broken glass scattered around.

24:44.870 --> 24:48.710
The breaking of the glass and
the discarding of Cate Hale

24:48.740 --> 24:52.830
Because of her epilepsy leads us to believe
that these are highly superstitious people

24:53.100 --> 24:55.710
And that they are playing
out a very specific ritual.

24:55.750 --> 24:59.040
The focus of this ritual
is the young girls.

25:06.690 --> 25:08.270
- Do we know why?
- No.

25:08.280 --> 25:11.270
But we do know from the
location of Cate Hale's house

25:11.300 --> 25:14.910
That they don't come across
these girls by accident.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.590
They study. They hunt.

25:31.730 --> 25:34.760
Cate's father said that she liked to go
to the movies at their local multiplex.

25:34.780 --> 25:35.880
That's a good place to start.

25:35.910 --> 25:38.400
Also look at the parks, malls.

25:38.430 --> 25:42.590
Concentrate on those that are an easy
drive from the rv parks you loCate.

25:42.620 --> 25:45.600
This family is out there and they're
looking for their next victim.

25:46.960 --> 25:49.070
You guys need to see this right now.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.170
Excuse us.

25:51.610 --> 25:52.560
What'soing on?

25:52.580 --> 25:54.360
- Garcia, you still there?
- Present.

25:54.370 --> 25:55.390
Explain what you got.

25:55.410 --> 25:59.720
Ok, I went ahead and went further back looking
for similar cases and I made the search national.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.590
- All these are hits?
- Yeah.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.850
There's 30 of them. They
go as far back as 1909.

26:04.860 --> 26:07.510
Rapid city, south dakota,
taos, new mexico, gary, indiana.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.900
My map is lit up like a christmas tree.

26:10.230 --> 26:12.820
All these girls were abducted
and had their parents killed?

26:12.870 --> 26:15.710
The time between the kills was long enough
and the regions of the country so spread out

26:15.760 --> 26:17.370
That it never showed up as serial.

26:17.390 --> 26:18.580
What the hell is this?

26:18.600 --> 26:22.150
I don't know, but it looks like
it's been going on for generations.

26:24.960 --> 26:28.010
<i>MADISON,ALABAMA</i>

26:38.240 --> 26:40.140
Reid and I will check inside.

26:40.170 --> 26:43.510
We've doubled our highway patrol shifts and
we've got roadblocks at every county line.

26:43.530 --> 26:45.080
Is there a picture on the wire?

26:45.110 --> 26:47.550
I pulled one out of her bedroom myself.

27:04.530 --> 27:06.530
They're bound to have hours on us.

27:06.550 --> 27:08.130
They didn't travel that far last time.

27:08.150 --> 27:10.030
The past killings have been years apart.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.780
We got lucky with Cate Hale.

27:11.790 --> 27:13.610
Her epilepsy saved her life.

27:13.630 --> 27:18.840
If this new girl fits the unsub's need, we might
have lost our window to catch them for years.

27:26.070 --> 27:27.380
This is what I don't get.

27:27.420 --> 27:31.560
In both this house and the Hales' house the
girls' bedrooms were closest to the exit.

27:31.590 --> 27:35.290
I mean, the unsubs actually had to go out of their
way to kill the parents before abducting the girls.

27:35.300 --> 27:36.740
I think it was a countermeasure.

27:36.770 --> 27:37.670
What do you mean?

27:37.710 --> 27:40.130
They've been doing this for years
and they've never been caught.

27:40.570 --> 27:41.380
Why?

27:41.410 --> 27:44.190
They disappear in the dead of night,
they have a head start on the cops,

27:44.200 --> 27:45.750
And they don't kill again for years.

27:45.770 --> 27:46.700
Exactly.

27:46.730 --> 27:49.940
When I was a cop, I would get 10 calls
a day from parents in child abductions.

27:49.970 --> 27:53.270
Now, as sad as that is, if the families
didn't stay on you, at a certain point,

27:53.310 --> 27:55.190
Other cases would just
start taking priority.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.700
So what are they doing with these girls?

28:01.230 --> 28:02.320
Yeah, what do you got, baby girl?

28:02.340 --> 28:04.270
Are you sitting down?

28:06.250 --> 28:08.530
- You're not gonna believe this.
- What's wrong?

28:08.540 --> 28:11.080
I think I know what they
were doing with the girls.

28:11.100 --> 28:14.940
Garcia got a hit on a hair fiber in the
blanket the unsubs used to wrap Cate Hale.

28:14.970 --> 28:16.530
So what's the problem?

28:16.550 --> 28:18.340
It belonged to Kathy gray.

28:18.350 --> 28:20.530
Why does that name sound familiar?

28:20.540 --> 28:24.000
She went missing in 1971 after
her parents were murdered.

28:24.020 --> 28:26.850
So you're telling me this little
girl is now one of our unsubs?

28:26.870 --> 28:27.760
That's what it looks like.

28:27.800 --> 28:31.590
Call Hotch. Tell him and Prentiss not to
come here and to meet us at the station.

28:35.730 --> 28:37.310
You ok?

28:37.320 --> 28:39.080
Yeah. I just need to build a tcker skin.

28:39.090 --> 28:42.310
You don't need to do anything
you don't want to. You understand?

28:42.780 --> 28:47.900
So these little girls got abducted and later
kidnapped other girls and killed their families?

28:47.960 --> 28:52.690
I think that's why these unsubs
pick girls the same age as the boy.

28:52.740 --> 28:54.550
What do you mean?

28:54.580 --> 28:57.610
They're making wives.

29:08.450 --> 29:10.800
It's ok.

29:10.810 --> 29:13.400
I know what you're going through.

29:13.430 --> 29:17.180
I understand. I really do.

29:18.310 --> 29:21.750
Come here. I'm going to
take this off you now. Ok?

29:29.440 --> 29:31.030
Come here.

29:38.980 --> 29:40.480
I want my mommy.

29:40.490 --> 29:42.730
No, no, no, everything's ok.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.570
You're a part of something now.

29:53.850 --> 29:56.530
I was just like you.

30:55.960 --> 31:00.390
A working theory from 1971 was that a transient
killed the family and abducted Kathy gray.

31:00.410 --> 31:01.780
Then all the leads went cold.

31:01.810 --> 31:05.210
How do you watch your family get murdered and
then make a life with the people who did it?

31:05.230 --> 31:07.860
It's stockholm syndrome.
You adapt or die.

31:07.870 --> 31:09.940
And now she's training
her son to be a murderer.

31:09.990 --> 31:13.550
At a certain point, once traditions are
handed down generation after generation,

31:13.580 --> 31:14.670
There is no right or wrong.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.060
You simply accept the
way the world works.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.330
The romany are a closed society.

31:19.360 --> 31:23.120
The unsub simply twisted and distorted
traditions to become entirely insular.

31:23.150 --> 31:24.910
Abduction the children
keeps the bloodline pure,

31:24.930 --> 31:27.950
And killing the parents ensures that
people eventually stop loong for them.

31:28.670 --> 31:31.570
We got a report of an rv on
fire about 20 miles from here.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.410
Dave, you, Reid, and
Morgan go check it out.

31:34.420 --> 31:39.560
Garcia, I need you to digitally alter Kathy gray's
photograph to simulate what she would look like today.

31:39.570 --> 31:41.980
- Consider it simulated.
- Thanks.

32:04.020 --> 32:06.540
It was started less than an
hour ago, so they can't be far.

32:06.570 --> 32:08.520
It looks like they
left almost everything.

32:08.530 --> 32:10.930
The got the girl they
wanted. They're starting over.

32:10.940 --> 32:12.570
Look at the clothes.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.480
Most of them still have
the store sensors on them.

32:14.510 --> 32:16.170
So how'd they get them
past security scanners?

32:16.190 --> 32:17.960
- Tinfoil.
- Excuse me?

32:17.970 --> 32:22.220
Cate Hale remembers being locked in a
closet surrounded by clothing and tinfoil.

32:22.230 --> 32:25.150
Shoplifters use tinfoil to line
their bags and negate security alarms.

32:25.180 --> 32:27.960
Makes sense. A lot of romany make
their living as petty thieves.

32:27.970 --> 32:29.940
It also explains the bells she heard.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.090
Cate says she remembers
hearing the sound of bells,

32:32.120 --> 32:34.260
Followed directly by the
father talking to the son.

32:34.290 --> 32:37.440
I think that's probably
what the mannequin's for.

32:37.470 --> 32:39.150
School of the 7 bells.

32:39.190 --> 32:41.160
You dress a mannequin, you
line a suit with 7 bells.

32:41.190 --> 32:44.570
If you can pick his pocket without a bell
ringing, you're ready to work a crowd.

32:44.590 --> 32:45.910
So we know how they make their money.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.090
That's not all we know.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.470
These unsubs are guided
entirely by ritual.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.020
They abducted Lynn Robillard
and killed her family in an area

32:52.050 --> 32:54.060
That they knew was surrounded
by police and the fbi.

32:54.070 --> 32:55.830
They had to. They can't deviate.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.470
We also know that they're starting over.

32:57.500 --> 32:58.830
Which means they're
gonna need some money.

32:58.850 --> 33:00.600
Where's the closest shopping mall?

33:00.630 --> 33:02.390
About 15 miles fm here.

33:02.410 --> 33:05.250
Hey, Hotch, we know where they're going.

33:09.860 --> 33:13.300
Focus on the high-end department
stores. They're bigger targets.

33:42.250 --> 33:45.390
Mom. Is this you?

33:54.680 --> 33:56.230
Ma'am!

33:56.240 --> 33:58.420
Hold it! Police!

34:00.920 --> 34:04.370
Set those bags down, rit now.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.300
Kathy gray! Take that woman!

34:10.310 --> 34:13.199
- I said put the bags down.
- Cuff her.

34:18.510 --> 34:20.320
Let's go.

34:26.290 --> 34:27.830
What's wrong?

34:27.850 --> 34:31.239
They've been stealing for
years and they never get caught.

34:31.260 --> 34:33.750
This was too easy.

34:36.170 --> 34:39.780
Kathy, I can't help you if you're
not going to be honest with me.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.580
I already told you, I killed them.

34:41.610 --> 34:43.159
- All by yourself.
- Yes.

34:43.170 --> 34:44.570
- Well, I know that's not true.
- It is.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.020
How did you do it?

34:46.040 --> 34:49.960
How did you abduct a child and control
two adults while you slit their throats?

34:49.989 --> 34:52.010
Oh, come on, you know she's
not responsible for this.

34:52.030 --> 34:55.150
I know we have a string of bodies, and
she knows where her husband and son are.

34:55.179 --> 34:58.560
- You are the victim here.
- No, she's not. She killed innocent people.

34:58.570 --> 35:00.160
Her family was murdered.

35:00.190 --> 35:01.940
And now she's killing other people's.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.370
Kathy, this is not your fault.

35:03.390 --> 35:07.000
My name isn't Kathy. It's sylvia.

35:07.010 --> 35:09.640
No, it isn't.

35:09.670 --> 35:11.990
Your name is Kathy gray.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.890
And you were a beautiful little girl.

35:13.960 --> 35:17.210
Your mom and dad were murdered
and you were kidnapped.

35:17.220 --> 35:20.070
Do you recognize yourself there?

35:23.180 --> 35:24.350
You see?

35:24.360 --> 35:25.380
I'm sick of this!

35:25.390 --> 35:27.580
- Then leave us alone!
- Where are your husband and son?

35:27.590 --> 35:29.360
Look at me, Kathy. Don't listen to him.

35:29.370 --> 35:33.460
They stole your life. Let
me help you get it back.

35:33.470 --> 35:37.930
That little girl is better off with my son
than any man she could meet in your society.

35:37.940 --> 35:41.080
I'm sure you raised him very well.

35:41.090 --> 35:42.320
Tell me about your own mother.

35:42.330 --> 35:44.190
I've already told you everything.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.650
I killed them, all by myself.

35:46.690 --> 35:47.550
How's it going so far?

35:47.580 --> 35:50.360
They're trying to crack her by
reminding her of the girl she used to be.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.520
I hope this good cop/
bad cop routine works.

35:52.550 --> 35:56.190
If her family gets away, we've
lost that little girl forever.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.430
You're lying.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.600
- Kathy-- - My
name isn't Kathy!

35:59.610 --> 36:01.810
yes, it is. Your name is Kathy gray.

36:01.820 --> 36:04.470
You're from vienna, virginia.

36:04.500 --> 36:08.160
Tell me where your husband and son are
so I can help you get your life back.

36:08.170 --> 36:10.110
- Want to see what you did?
- Hey, don't show her those.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.230
If she killed them herself,
she can see it again.

36:12.250 --> 36:14.890
Serial killers like to relive
their crimes. Did you know that?

36:14.900 --> 36:16.440
This is geoff Hale.

36:16.470 --> 36:19.910
He died from a strong, decisive
cut. I think that was your husband.

36:19.920 --> 36:23.050
Nancy Hale, her wound was more
tentative. This was your son, right?

36:23.060 --> 36:26.040
I'm sure by the time he teaches his own
son how to kill, His hand will be steady.

36:26.050 --> 36:28.100
- ok, stop-- - This is
the Robillard family.

36:28.110 --> 36:29.890
Kathy, you don't have to look at that.

36:29.910 --> 36:32.310
Do you want to see some more?

36:35.120 --> 36:36.140
I don't know what that is.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.580
Then look closely!

36:39.340 --> 36:42.500
You don't recognize your
own mother and father?

36:45.800 --> 36:49.570
See?This is the tentative
cut your future husband made

36:49.580 --> 36:52.400
while he slit your mother's throat.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.030
Where are your husband and son?

36:55.040 --> 37:00.420
Cate Hale is only alive because
of you, Kathy.Isn't that--

37:00.720 --> 37:03.720
your--your husband wanted
to kill her, And you didn't.

37:03.730 --> 37:04.540
no.

37:04.560 --> 37:07.400
How does that make you feel?

37:09.170 --> 37:12.930
To know that he was willing
to kill that little girl?

37:12.940 --> 37:16.700
That he would have been
willing to kill you, too?

37:16.710 --> 37:20.280
They murdered your family,
Kathy, and they took you in,

37:20.310 --> 37:22.830
- But you were never really one of them.
- No.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.310
You were just a breeder.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.710
I won't betray my family.

37:25.740 --> 37:27.380
Your little boy is only 10.

37:27.410 --> 37:30.490
There is a chance he could get
out of custody when he's 18,

37:30.520 --> 37:32.470
But that's only if we get to him.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.280
I love my family.

37:34.290 --> 37:36.360
- Then tell us where your son is
- She's ready.

37:36.370 --> 37:39.370
and we can all help him together.

37:43.350 --> 37:45.740
Scott woodland, zander blanchard...

37:45.750 --> 37:46.750
Ok, come on, give her a second.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.060
Max estep, chip jackson.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.580
I don't know who those people are.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.170
It's a list of every
known fence in huntsville.

37:53.180 --> 37:55.430
And you're gonna tell us who
your husband took the goods to.

37:55.450 --> 37:58.910
- Coles rudzinski, pete shernit,
- come on, give her a minute to do the right thing.

37:58.920 --> 38:02.630
- Matt thorne, brent woodhouse...
- Ok, I can't stop him, Kathy.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.880
This is it. This is your last
chance to make things right.

38:04.890 --> 38:07.160
Kevin everson, mike fenner,

38:07.170 --> 38:09.390
- Morris
collins-- - stop!

38:09.400 --> 38:11.090
- Morris collins.
- Ok.

38:11.100 --> 38:12.650
I won't tell you.

38:12.660 --> 38:14.810
You just did.

38:22.860 --> 38:25.490
The boy's not with him.

38:27.400 --> 38:30.060
Where are the children?

38:33.770 --> 38:37.200
I'll only tell you if
you let me see my son.

38:56.190 --> 38:59.030
Fbi! Hands in the air! Hands in the air!

38:59.570 --> 39:03.030
Get on your knees!
Down on the ground! Now!

39:07.740 --> 39:09.910
You know, we got a long list
of girls to go through with you.

39:09.920 --> 39:13.540
In history, warriors invaded towns,
killed the men, women, and boys,

39:13.550 --> 39:15.160
But kept the girls for themselves.

39:15.170 --> 39:19.310
You exist because your ancestors
did what was needed for u to survive.

39:19.330 --> 39:21.790
- Get him out of here.
- You'll never find my boy!

39:21.800 --> 39:24.310
We already have.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.940
Come on, come on.

39:59.310 --> 40:01.740
Kathy.

40:08.130 --> 40:10.600
It's just you now.

40:11.130 --> 40:14.100
You're going to be strong.

40:16.790 --> 40:19.690
I love you, puyule.

40:22.350 --> 40:24.130
Nu le spunelor despre furititai.

40:24.140 --> 40:25.490
What did you tell him?

40:25.500 --> 40:27.860
Ok, Kathy, no.

40:28.590 --> 40:31.330
Sheriff, get that videotape. We
need to get it to a translator.

40:31.340 --> 40:33.520
You got it.

40:39.050 --> 40:41.370
- The translation should be here in a few minutes.
- Good.

40:41.380 --> 40:44.140
The little girl's aunt and uncle are
on their way here from birmingham.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.060
They'll be here in a few hours.

40:46.070 --> 40:48.190
And also, i--i
just spoke with jj.

40:48.220 --> 40:50.580
She'll be at her desk by the
time we get back to quantico.

40:50.600 --> 40:52.260
She has 3 more weeks of maternity leave.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.500
I know, but she's ing to be back.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.800
And, honestly, i'm...

40:56.830 --> 41:00.440
Ready to get back to counter-terrorism.
It's... Where i'm needed.

41:00.450 --> 41:03.220
They're lucky to have you.

41:05.510 --> 41:08.020
- May I say something?
- Sure.

41:09.280 --> 41:12.010
This team is like a family.

41:12.020 --> 41:16.690
And families take on the
traits of their leaders.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.840
You don't show much emotion.

41:18.860 --> 41:19.820
Meaning what?

41:19.830 --> 41:23.210
I've sat at jj's desk and i've looked at
some of the worst things i've ever seen

41:23.220 --> 41:25.970
just trying to do half her job.
