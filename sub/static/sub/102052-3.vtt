WEBVTT

00:14.723 --> 00:17.142
<i>We all know</i>
<i>how this ends, don't we?</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:22.188
<i>Everybody dies.</i>

00:22.897 --> 00:24.441
<i>That shouldn't be a surprise.</i>

00:25.358 --> 00:29.529
<i>So, what's an old white man to do</i>
<i>with a lifetime of knowledge,</i>

00:30.155 --> 00:31.823
<i>doomed to erasure,</i>

00:33.199 --> 00:35.201
<i>except wield it like a sword?</i>

00:36.828 --> 00:39.039
<i>Great men say, "Balls to death."</i>

00:40.457 --> 00:42.125
<i>My crew respect that.</i>

00:51.009 --> 00:53.970
Good morning, dear family. Rise and shine.

00:55.388 --> 00:59.184
<i>We are 2,468 days from departure,</i>

00:59.684 --> 01:01.436
<i>and three days since reconnection.</i>

01:02.103 --> 01:03.813
<i>For a special comrade,</i>

01:03.897 --> 01:09.444
<i>I have chosen Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns'</i>
<i>"Royal March of the Lions."</i>

01:10.153 --> 01:11.571
<i>We are lions,</i>

01:11.654 --> 01:15.366
here to reclaim our Engine Eternal

01:15.450 --> 01:17.911
from a gibbering pack of hyenas.

01:19.287 --> 01:22.832
Our pride stalks, waits,

01:22.916 --> 01:26.628
each of you
playing your parts in a great odyssey.

01:27.378 --> 01:29.964
<i>Some pay a higher cost than others.</i>

01:30.048 --> 01:33.927
<i>And none among us</i>
<i>has paid more than Icy Bob.</i>

01:34.928 --> 01:38.223
<i>We should all</i>
<i>make sacrifices like our Bob.</i>

01:39.057 --> 01:41.309
<i>Honing our purpose to the ready.</i>

01:42.268 --> 01:46.231
<i>Let our Coldman unite us,</i>
<i>the point of our spear...</i>

01:51.486 --> 01:53.988
<i>for the day we retake...</i>

01:55.573 --> 01:56.699
what's mine.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.393
<i>-Apocalypse isn't so bad, really...</i>

02:25.478 --> 02:28.439
<i>...if you can just muddle through,</i>
<i>show a little ingenuity.</i>

02:29.440 --> 02:32.026
<i>People line up for tickets</i>
<i>to the only show in town.</i>

02:32.986 --> 02:35.905
<i>Aboard</i> Snowpiercer, <i>my train,</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:39.159
<i>all 1,034 cars long.</i>

03:14.277 --> 03:17.697
Standing fast in the face
of doubt, especially your own,

03:17.780 --> 03:19.282
it's what a leader has to do.

03:19.365 --> 03:23.536
Sure, but it's not
what a mother should do.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.212
If Mother Earth
is coming back to life, then, yes,

03:34.213 --> 03:35.715
it's what a mother should do.

03:39.218 --> 03:40.053
One month.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.436
About an hour left
until we switch track and head west.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.028
Breakfast is served.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.368
It's going to be a shitshow getting
<i>Snowpiercer</i> over that mountain.

04:04.702 --> 04:06.037
They smell our eggs, you know.

04:06.871 --> 04:09.290
Now they're craving
fresh food like never before.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.043
-Mmm. God.

04:12.710 --> 04:13.544
Good.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.214
Everyone needs to stay hungry.

04:19.592 --> 04:22.178
A scar to remind you
how far you're willing to go.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.139
All it does is remind me
that Melanie flipped the tables on us.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.685
I know. Sound science
that the Earth may be warming.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.353
It's fabulous.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.439
And she's departing
on a veritable suicide mission,

04:33.523 --> 04:36.859
leaving Mr. Layton,
our fearsome revolutionary.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.361
I'm tingling.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.364
This will be far more fun

04:42.073 --> 04:44.033
than simply slitting his throat.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.956
<i>Big Alice,</i> do you copy?
This is <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

04:50.957 --> 04:53.167
<i>Well, it's lovely</i>
<i>to finally hear your voices.</i>

04:54.794 --> 04:57.005
This is the old Rocky Mountain test track.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.172
AKA "Neckbreaker."

04:58.840 --> 05:01.843
<i>But I assure you</i>
<i>it's much more dangerous than it sounds.</i>

05:03.386 --> 05:06.347
This high point here
is as close as we can get to the station.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.182
<i>No,</i>
Snowpiercer <i>is the problem.</i>

05:08.266 --> 05:10.560
We just came over Neckbreaker.
That track is sound.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.896
But because <i>Snowpiercer</i>
has to slow for the Berthoud Curve,

05:13.980 --> 05:16.065
we won't have enough speed
to get up that mountain.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.527
But once we're through the curve,
<i>Big Alice</i> can activate our booster.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.946
It can give us
just enough torque to take us over.

05:22.030 --> 05:22.989
<i>That's correct.</i>

05:23.072 --> 05:24.365
And if it doesn't work?

05:24.449 --> 05:27.327
<i>"If it doesn't work?"</i>
<i>Is that you, Mr. Layton?</i>

05:27.410 --> 05:30.538
Whatever are you doing
among the Engineers?

05:31.539 --> 05:33.666
Civilian oversight, Mr. Wilford.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.501
<i>-That's how it is up here now.</i>
-"Civilian"?

05:36.085 --> 05:37.920
What happens if it doesn't work is this.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.715
We have to reverse out of there,
go around the world,

05:40.798 --> 05:42.508
and come at it from the other direction.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.885
Oh, we don't want that.

05:43.968 --> 05:47.889
Melanie will miss her window
to jump ship and die saving the world.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.307
<i>Won't you, Melanie?</i>

05:50.433 --> 05:52.977
Yes, we would miss this opportunity.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.855
<i>And the truth is,</i>
<i>we don't have the luxury of time.</i>

05:57.106 --> 05:59.942
Okay, so that's the plan.
Let's get to work.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.403
Ruth is sending you a list of supplies.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.946
This isn't the right stationery.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.075
I would like permission
to come aboard with Ben to pull equipment.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.701
<i>Nope. Not Ben.</i>

06:09.786 --> 06:11.913
Oh, really? And why not Ben?

06:11.996 --> 06:15.208
Because <i>Big Alice</i> is a Ben-Free Zone, Ben.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.584
<i>Then Alex can help me.</i>

06:19.754 --> 06:21.589
Very well. Send me your list.

06:21.672 --> 06:24.634
<i>I'll meet you at the border</i>
<i>and frisk you myself.</i>

06:24.717 --> 06:25.551
Good.

06:26.344 --> 06:29.555
Well, we have a thousand kilometers
of dead-straight track before the Rockies.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.599
Let's see what two engines can do.

06:41.859 --> 06:44.529
We've left the main track,
heading for the Rockies.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.991
Hey. Wilford's gonna
squeeze us for these supplies.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.910
And we still need parts for <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

06:50.993 --> 06:52.870
Yeah, I got an idea for that.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.914
I'm gonna come with you up to the border.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.916
I have a list of supplies to deliver.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.252
Thank you, Ruth.
-What for?

06:59.335 --> 07:02.171
Helping drag us into the Rockies
on a suicide mission?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.506
I leave that to you.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.509
She doesn't make it easy on you, does she?

07:07.635 --> 07:09.929
My advice, don't lie to her.

07:10.471 --> 07:13.141
I regret that I did,
and I'll probably never make it right.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.101
But, for you,

07:15.685 --> 07:17.812
she's a rare straight arrow
if you can keep her.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.066
<i>Make way, Mr. Roche.</i>

07:22.150 --> 07:24.277
And best make your way to the border.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.445
Why? What's going on?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.364
Engineers and mountains
almost as big as their egos.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.366
Where will we land when the snow settles?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.702
Hopefully on a couchette,
with my wife and a cold beer.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.166
Hey, boss.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.042
I'm not your boss anymore.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.634
You sleep in here?

07:48.718 --> 07:50.261
Single life, remember?

07:51.721 --> 07:54.056
I broke up with my Second Class cabin.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.268
You're Train Detective.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.812
Layton should be able to find you a berth,
for Pete's sake.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.939
Yeah, I got more important issues.

08:02.023 --> 08:02.982
That Tailie assault?

08:04.066 --> 08:04.901
It ain't good.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.071
There's much ado about something
at the border. Let's go find him.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.702
Rubber stamps. I mean, look at her.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.538
How's a Tailie supposed
to move a little weed now?

08:21.542 --> 08:22.418
It'll work.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.045
It might work.

08:24.962 --> 08:27.089
Just wanna set the hook in his people.

08:28.716 --> 08:32.094
Ladies and gentlemen,
the bell of progress.

08:32.178 --> 08:36.015
A hotline at the border,
and communication between the engines.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.184
Let's all be on our best, now.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.731
Good morning, <i>Big Alice.</i>

08:43.814 --> 08:46.359
This is <i>Snowpiercer's</i> Head of Hospitality.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.610
We are clear for crossing.

08:56.827 --> 08:57.870
Good morning.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.499
Shouldn't, uh, Kevin be doing this?

09:02.041 --> 09:03.000
I'm doing it.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.418
Poor Kevin is ill.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.004
Must have picked up something

09:07.088 --> 09:09.257
unsanitary over there
with you, Mr. Layton.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.302
Have you seen
your frenemy's shopping list?

09:13.386 --> 09:14.887
Yes, sir, I have.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.226
You want six
redox flow batteries, Melanie?

09:20.309 --> 09:21.143
That's right.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.020
Where's Alex?

09:23.104 --> 09:24.313
Oh, she's packing your chute.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.566
Are you nervous?

09:29.610 --> 09:30.444
You can have four.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.071
No, I need all six,

09:32.154 --> 09:34.115
so I can make it through
the first 24 hours

09:34.198 --> 09:35.700
and get the station powered up.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.827
Well, I'm not giving you a volt sled.

09:38.452 --> 09:41.163
Pretty sure you have three volt sleds.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.124
Yes, I have three volt sleds.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.584
But if I give you one,

09:46.335 --> 09:48.087
I'll only have two, won't I?

09:48.588 --> 09:51.215
Actually, sir, that's just Melanie's list.

09:51.299 --> 09:54.218
<i>Snowpiercer</i> is in need of parts,
as I understand,

09:54.302 --> 09:56.304
particularly the um...
the...

09:56.387 --> 09:57.847
-Bogie motors.
-Bogie motors.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.391
Three, I'm told.

10:00.474 --> 10:03.269
They're pretty important
seeing as we're all one train now.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.023
So, I thought that maybe
we could work out a trade.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.818
Some fresh fruit, vegetables,

10:10.901 --> 10:13.613
bread, eggs, a jug of apple cider.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.158
We will supplement
your diet once a week...

10:18.075 --> 10:19.410
in exchange for parts.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.713
You seem like a capable leader.

10:32.173 --> 10:36.385
Amazing what you've learned...
in such a short time.

10:39.513 --> 10:40.723
I'll consider it.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.559
And I'm leaving on
a volt sled in 14 hours, Joseph.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.062
Permission to board.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.648
Hospitality would be happy to escort, sir.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.359
Regretfully, not today, Ruth.
You'll get your turn.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.277
Bring her in.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.112
<i>Adieu,</i> Mr. Layton!

10:57.114 --> 10:58.741
Pretty soon, it's just you and him.

11:10.586 --> 11:15.299
Twenty-seven cars
of supplies, Melanie. Twenty-seven.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.593
All the bits and bobs.

11:18.636 --> 11:19.845
The stuff of life.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.474
Our chances of survival
just got a lot better.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.144
A warming trend.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.146
Genius.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.275
I was up all night
mulling your hypothesis.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.111
It's plausible. The Headwoods agree.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.320
Then put your mind to it.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.198
'Cause if we can model it,
then maybe we can build our first colony.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.741
Please, I'm aboard.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.452
Bravo, you've filled the train with hope.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.914
It's just sad you're gonna
freeze to death for the data.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.126
You find that
tragicomic, too, Alex?

11:50.209 --> 11:51.085
No.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.671
No, with six RFBs she'll be fine.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.964
Oh, what a shame.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.466
If you can make it to the station.

11:58.676 --> 11:59.510
Yeah.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.930
Yeah, that's the, uh... first hurdle.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.850
You can go, Dubs.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.310
I've got her.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.195
You'll be in deep, drifted snow.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.700
If you have to detour through
any crevasses or avalanche debris,

12:22.783 --> 12:25.411
your sled could be out of fuel
by the time you get to the station.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.997
The sled can stay dead
till I have to get back to the track.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.666
No, because we don't know
how degraded their solar panels are.

12:30.749 --> 12:34.295
And your data systems need a reliable
power source to create a climate model.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.131
I'll get it done.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.432
Pass me that voltmeter.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.855
I haven't seen
any other kids on <i>Alice.</i>

12:53.856 --> 12:56.108
Well, that would be
'cause I'm the youngest crew member.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.068
Do you have any friends?

13:10.873 --> 13:14.710
Just what do you think is going
to happen here over the next few hours?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.923
As much as possible.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.132
Kind of ironic, right?

13:20.216 --> 13:24.011
'Cause we're here packing your shit
so that you can leave me, again.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.221
It's worse than ironic.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.056
It's awful.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.142
I'm sorry.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.480
Leave once, that's a decision.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.525
Then you leave me twice,
and then that becomes a choice.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.819
Yes, I'm choosing to go.

13:42.071 --> 13:45.491
But only because there's not much
chance of a world for you if I don't.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.919
Okay, so... what do you wanna know?

13:59.547 --> 14:00.381
Everything.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.426
What do you love to do?

14:05.844 --> 14:07.263
Who pierced your ears?

14:07.930 --> 14:08.931
Where you sleep.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.560
Will you ever laugh?

14:18.399 --> 14:20.025
-Ha!

14:21.777 --> 14:22.611
Okay.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.197
I'll show you where I sleep.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.533
Come on.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.471
She doesn't want Miles to see her.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.223
She knows everything, <i>mijo.</i>

15:01.108 --> 15:02.693
I'm so sorry, Josie.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.322
For what?

15:06.405 --> 15:08.282
Falling back into Zarah?

15:09.783 --> 15:10.784
I was dead.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.331
Yeah. But you're not dead.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.043
You're right here.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.211
Look at me, Layton.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.215
I don't care
who the mother of your child is.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.135
You know who did this to me.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.053
Melanie.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.432
I had to make the alliance.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.100
It was the only way.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.562
You sacrificed 35 Tailies to her plan.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.565
The people who I convinced to fight.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.985
I wanted to die with them.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.988
But now you've given them
nothing that we promised.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.200
And your leadership is in question.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.827
Josie, this mission--

15:53.911 --> 15:55.079
It's Melanie's mission.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.914
Yes, I believe the Engineers.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.667
I believe that this is our best chance.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.462
And now, it is my job
to defend it from Mr. Wilford.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.840
Revolutionaries make terrible politicians.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.343
That's how they see you now.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.472
I am still a Tailie, Josie.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.643
And you need my support,

16:17.726 --> 16:19.019
or you'll lose them.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.483
Still no marijuana, huh?

16:26.610 --> 16:28.404
You sold yourself as a smuggler.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.574
I smuggle smugly, my friend.

16:33.158 --> 16:36.996
I just came from the border, where I was
privy to some high-level trade talks.

16:37.788 --> 16:41.709
My advice at this time would be
to have another olive, be patient.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.293
Not my strong suit.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.172
So, if you got no weed...

16:50.509 --> 16:51.343
Yes?

16:51.427 --> 16:53.053
I really don't want you sitting up here.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.931
No offense, it just looks bad.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.559
You know, dealing with the Tail.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.692
Sorry, Lights, you gotta show me.

17:11.697 --> 17:12.698
See?

17:12.781 --> 17:14.074
What's that look like to you?

17:14.158 --> 17:15.743
You must have seen something.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.037
They black-bagged me.
It happened in seconds.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.497
I saw them run away. They had masks.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.499
Yeah. Took the fingers with them.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.501
Track talk says it was the Breachmen.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.794
I'm not saying nothing.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.254
Just come gunning for me harder.

17:27.337 --> 17:30.132
She was trying to open
a repair stall in the market.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.135
How free's the Tail
if everyone's still prejudiced against us?

17:33.218 --> 17:35.345
Hey, One Tail.
All right, we'll protect ourselves.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.223
You all know how to protect each other
and hold the line.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.683
Just don't cross it.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.393
We got this.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.520
Yeah, and I got you.

17:44.271 --> 17:47.149
I'm gonna find out who did this,
and they're not coming back.

17:48.067 --> 17:48.901
Okay?

17:50.778 --> 17:53.280
I said it before.
Wilford's already got people here.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.198
Yeah?

17:54.281 --> 17:57.534
-Breachmen love Wilford and hate Tailies.
-But that's not proof of anything.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.328
Someone's trying to throw
the fear of God into us.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.621
They're top of the list.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.664
Roche, wanna go with her
to visit the Breachmen?

18:03.957 --> 18:04.917
Not really, no.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.293
Thank you.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.298
Breachmen, I hate these guys.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.759
Well, I used to be police,
so just do what I do.

18:13.842 --> 18:14.676
What's that?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.053
Think of them as firemen.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.731
You can't just chip in here.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.192
-Nice to see you, too, Boki.
-I wouldn't go that far.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.653
No, but we're paying him
the courtesy of a house call.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.780
So, who's been wearing masks lately,

18:35.364 --> 18:37.241
attacking Tailies up by the Tea Room?

18:37.324 --> 18:38.283
Anyone?

18:41.411 --> 18:42.246
Weights down.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.919
This Guild drinks an awful lot
of Wilford Kool-Aid, don't you?

18:49.419 --> 18:52.005
A lot of us are glad that he's back.

18:52.589 --> 18:55.467
Well, what do you gotta say
about cutting off people's fingers?

18:56.718 --> 18:59.346
Hey, you boys can oil up and talk
at the same time, right?

18:59.429 --> 19:01.431
Why so tense, Detective Till?

19:01.974 --> 19:02.808
Hmm?

19:03.433 --> 19:06.812
I don't know, you guys seem
a lot more jacked than me.

19:06.895 --> 19:09.189
Yeah, we're juicing
the world's last steroids up in here.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.609
You are half-ass famous.

19:12.693 --> 19:16.280
Brakeman helped lead the revolution.

19:16.363 --> 19:17.197
That's me.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.657
Where was your Guild?

19:18.740 --> 19:21.326
Right here. We were in mourning.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.954
Yeah, when we found out
Wilford wasn't even in the Engine,

19:24.037 --> 19:26.373
it was... very traumatic.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.626
So we sat it out.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.797
Just like we'll be sitting out
your democratic experiment.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.842
We don't need to attack nobody.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.345
We'll be right here, waiting...

19:42.347 --> 19:43.182
for him.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.240
Holy shit.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.952
-On my watch?
-Don't you dare tell him.

20:04.745 --> 20:08.332
Hi, I'm, uh... Alex's mom.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.249
Melanie.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.043
Oh, my God.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.628
You're on your own, Alex.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.506
Don't worry about that.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.134
Hurry up.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.306
It's a nice bunk.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.726
We get to decorate them,
but they're all the same.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.728
Except for Wilford's.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.440
Well, you made it nice.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.196
I use this to visualize our route.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.698
Yeah. Me, too. Same trick.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.076
Well,
we did have the same teacher.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.211
I used to draw you...

20:55.754 --> 20:57.381
to picture what you looked like.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.677
I pictured your face, too, all the time.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.224
Wow.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.142
You're so talented.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.523
Wilford says
you're the best driver he's ever seen.

21:22.864 --> 21:26.243
Hey, Rocky Mountain test track.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.744
"Neckbreaker."

21:27.828 --> 21:29.037
Not this time, though.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.417
When <i>Snowpiercer</i>
gets to the Berthoud Curve,

21:33.500 --> 21:35.627
<i>-Big Alice</i> will be all the way back here.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.962
Firepower and strength

21:37.045 --> 21:39.798
will get <i>Snowpiercer</i> through
this crazy vertical.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.675
Then at the highest peak
you have to get out

21:41.758 --> 21:43.844
and take the sled
all the way back to the station.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.722
Yeah. And then you guys
do the most important part.

21:46.805 --> 21:50.058
Lay a string of weather balloons
across the Bering Sea Bridge,

21:50.142 --> 21:53.395
down into Siberia, China,
up into the Himalaya.

21:55.313 --> 21:58.483
Then we have to circle back
to the station and pick you up in a month.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.402
Yeah.

22:04.614 --> 22:06.533
That is some crazy shit, Mom.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.256
What are you doing?

22:21.798 --> 22:22.841
Feeling the train.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.385
She lets you know how she's doing.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.848
<i>Snowpiercer's</i> already
in the mountains up ahead.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.809
-You can feel that?
-Mmm-hmm.

22:34.102 --> 22:37.314
Think you might have a wheel
out of alignment, too. Better check.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.118
We need to go.

22:52.996 --> 22:54.081
Parts for food.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.042
You cut that deal
face-to-face with Wilford?

22:57.125 --> 22:58.168
Establish trade.

22:58.668 --> 23:01.630
It's not done yet, but he'll go for it.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.381
That must be what worries me.

23:04.132 --> 23:05.175
He's a jealous man.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.638
You know, when he chooses you,

23:10.180 --> 23:11.723
you enter his court.

23:12.349 --> 23:15.769
It's amazing at first, he's amazing.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.188
But then the knives come out.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.398
He divides people for sport.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.275
Melanie and I refused to let him.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.737
-Is that why <i>Big Alice</i> is a Ben-Free Zone?
Probably.

23:26.363 --> 23:31.701
His brand of jealousy isn't about anything
normal like love, or betrayal, or sex.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.496
It's just about control.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.708
We might have to find a way to use that.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.627
Yeah, we might.

23:40.710 --> 23:43.171
But we still have to go
halfway across the world with him,

23:44.089 --> 23:45.423
so whatever your plans are...

23:45.507 --> 23:46.842
No secrets.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.803
We'll get back to Melanie together.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.145
How's my boy?

24:00.772 --> 24:01.815
Ninety-six below.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.359
Fifty-four minutes.
Best he's ever done.

24:08.780 --> 24:12.325
He needs to go colder. Longer.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.120
Well,
we need a few more treatments.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.164
Do we have the full month?

24:17.247 --> 24:18.790
Count on half that.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.580
Is she still doing that?

25:00.040 --> 25:02.792
She said there's a wheel out of alignment.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.420
And?

25:05.503 --> 25:07.631
Well, I asked the drivetrain guys,
and she's right.

25:07.714 --> 25:10.550
Car nine, front bogie, left rear.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.178
Right under the barracks,
and none of us even saw it.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.848
You're not going
sentimental on me, are you?

25:18.016 --> 25:19.059
No.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.811
We want her off this train.

25:23.647 --> 25:24.689
Look at me.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.485
I want to hear you say it.

25:28.568 --> 25:30.528
We want her off this train.

25:33.531 --> 25:36.368
Alice, <i>we are on descent.</i>

25:38.495 --> 25:39.746
Hello, Melanie.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.041
Have you got your woollies on
for your grand exit?

25:43.625 --> 25:44.834
No, not yet.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.753
But you're nearly rid of me, Joseph.

25:46.836 --> 25:48.922
<i>Well,</i>
<i>in that spirit of cooperation,</i>

25:49.631 --> 25:51.633
<i>Alex will be in the driver's seat.</i>

25:52.217 --> 25:55.220
<i>I think it's only fitting she drive</i>
<i>her mother into the great beyond,</i>

25:55.303 --> 25:56.471
<i>don't the rest of you?</i>

26:00.225 --> 26:01.226
Roger that.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.145
Glad to have you, Engineer.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.650
Roger, <i>Snowpiercer.</i>
We see that you're approaching the curve.

26:08.733 --> 26:09.734
<i>Less than a minute away.</i>

26:09.818 --> 26:11.736
<i>But we have hit</i>
<i>our first little speed bump.</i>

26:11.820 --> 26:13.154
Oh, let me guess.

26:13.238 --> 26:16.616
Snowpiercer <i>doesn't quite</i>
<i>have the reserves you anticipated.</i>

26:16.700 --> 26:17.784
We have a solution.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.287
All right, listen up.

26:20.370 --> 26:23.832
To make over the top, we're gonna need
to pull power from First and Second Class.

26:23.915 --> 26:27.460
The only life support will be
in the clinic cars and muster stations.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.462
We're gonna need the extra juice in...

26:30.046 --> 26:31.089
twenty-five minutes.

26:31.172 --> 26:34.384
Twenty-five minutes?
To get everyone to muster?

26:34.467 --> 26:36.303
You can do this, Ruth. I know you can.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.472
Everyone, hold on.
We're coming in hot!

26:51.234 --> 26:52.902
Everyone okay?

26:59.034 --> 27:01.494
All right, then, Mr. Layton.
You're with me.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.330
If Melanie doesn't derail us.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.714
Emergency. Emergency.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.841
First and Second Class to the Nightcar.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.552
<i>Third to the Ag-Sec or Mess Hall.</i>

27:18.178 --> 27:19.971
<i>Emergency, muster stations...</i>

27:20.055 --> 27:22.182
-Keep moving.
<i>Please...</i>

27:22.265 --> 27:23.391
All the way to the end.

27:25.226 --> 27:27.729
Andre, where are you going?
We're mustering in the Nightcar.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.731
They're not moving
the patients from the clinic.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.566
You're gonna see Josie?
-She's alone.

27:31.649 --> 27:33.693
Yeah, go be with her.
Right this way, guys. Come on.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.695
All the way to the end.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.447
Second Class
is entering the curve.

27:37.530 --> 27:40.033
That is to say prepare to brace.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.536
Thank you.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.747
My God. For pity's sake, Tristan.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.459
All right. Nice and calm now, everyone.

27:49.542 --> 27:51.211
Muster stations, please.

28:08.478 --> 28:09.938
I need to see it.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.984
Nice and calm. Keep moving.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.446
This way.

28:19.614 --> 28:22.200
All right, car clear. Sealing up!

28:52.564 --> 28:55.692
<i>Alice,</i> we're on ascent.
Is the weather any better up top, Javi?

28:55.775 --> 28:58.361
-Afraid not.
-We gotta get up there first.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.864
Our speed is dropping too fast.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.743
How much longer
until we can draw that extra power?

29:04.826 --> 29:06.077
Few more minutes.

29:06.703 --> 29:09.205
<i>We're still</i>
<i>getting everyone to muster stations.</i>

29:09.956 --> 29:11.791
Could be a few minutes too late.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.669
Okay, I just don't see
how we're gonna make it, Melanie.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.175
The solution is simple.

29:20.842 --> 29:24.137
The very moment we hit the booster
will have to be much earlier, won't it?

29:24.220 --> 29:26.055
Hit the boosters before the curve?

29:26.139 --> 29:27.849
That's too much speed, we'll derail.

29:28.725 --> 29:31.227
I believe we've found
a teaching moment for Alex.

29:32.854 --> 29:36.232
<i>She'll have to keep up speed,</i>
<i>but not so fast that she derails us,</i>

29:36.316 --> 29:37.817
and we all die.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.575
She can do it. She can handle it.

29:45.658 --> 29:48.995
Snowpiercer?
<i>Come in,</i> Snowpiercer.

29:51.581 --> 29:52.999
Copy, <i>Big Alice.</i>

29:53.583 --> 29:54.709
<i>You got this, Allie.</i>

29:55.502 --> 29:58.755
<i>Just lay off the brakes, keep your nerve.</i>

30:01.424 --> 30:04.093
Isn't it nice
to work as a team again, Melanie?

30:05.845 --> 30:08.515
Muster stations. Come in.

30:08.598 --> 30:11.601
A brand-new show is about to begin.

30:12.602 --> 30:16.064
Melanie is on a mission,
and Mr. Wilford is...

30:16.147 --> 30:18.066
The hell is going on with her?

30:18.149 --> 30:19.442
She's cracking, Roche.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.612
We all are, if you haven't noticed.

30:22.695 --> 30:25.281
-All clear. Sealed and ready.
-Ruth!

30:29.118 --> 30:30.411
Engine, how are we doing?

30:30.495 --> 30:33.665
All passengers are at muster,
ready for shutdown.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.542
And Hail bloody Mary.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.669
We'll take it, Ruth. Amen.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.673
Power down the cars now!

30:41.756 --> 30:42.841
Copy!

30:50.598 --> 30:51.516
Powered down.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.644
Speed's still falling.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.733
More speed. Take it from storage.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.278
I already have.
We have to hit the booster.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.654
We're almost to the curve.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.407
We're armed!

31:08.491 --> 31:09.951
I'm proud you're here, Alex.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.329
Copy.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.999
She copies, if you didn't hear that.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.338
Push her over the hill.

31:22.922 --> 31:24.215
She'll be gone again.

31:38.021 --> 31:40.189
You want this climb to fall short.

31:40.857 --> 31:45.403
If you want to spend more time
with Mummy, just don't hit the booster.

31:50.742 --> 31:51.909
She's got it.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.703
Speed's climbing, Allie.

31:54.495 --> 31:55.622
<i>Hold on to it!</i>

32:06.382 --> 32:09.427
If we accelerate any more,
we'll run ourselves right over the bank.

32:10.136 --> 32:13.389
Or just tap the brakes. It's up to you.

32:17.268 --> 32:18.436
You got this, Alex.

32:19.937 --> 32:21.564
Just feel the train.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.734
I'll get you there, Melanie.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.169
And it's farewell to Mother!

32:43.252 --> 32:45.838
Such drama! Bravo!

32:46.381 --> 32:47.465
<i>You did it.</i>

32:49.175 --> 32:50.551
You did it, Allie.

32:53.513 --> 32:54.847
I'll see you at the cold lock.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.349
Time to go, Melanie.

33:03.898 --> 33:05.316
Look at me again.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.573
That's the last tear I'll allow.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.492
It's the last one you'll get.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.599
Oh, come on, Alex,
cut the umbilical!

33:39.350 --> 33:42.437
We're at the beginning
of a great adventure!

33:45.606 --> 33:48.192
-Where are you going?
-Suit check and gear lock.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.153
Gotta keep it nice and slow for her drop.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.154
Jupiter!

33:52.780 --> 33:53.948
Down, Jupiter!

33:55.491 --> 33:57.243
I let you spoil her.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.621
The dog, too.

34:01.706 --> 34:05.418
Go on, then. Say your last goodbyes.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.051
Wilford.
Everybody get it.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.053
I'll take that.

34:15.136 --> 34:18.389
I know Wilford's back,
but you need to get it together.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.101
We're not ready for this.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.312
-Yeah.
-Hello again, Detective Till.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.731
Pastor Logan. You know each other?

34:26.814 --> 34:28.357
Lead Brakeman Roche. Of course I do.

34:28.941 --> 34:31.694
What is it
you're worried we're not ready for?

34:31.778 --> 34:33.780
We just never got our feet set.

34:33.863 --> 34:36.866
Never showed these people
they could trust the new system.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.659
Now Wilford's back in their heads.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.746
You see what's changed in you?
And through all this turmoil?

34:42.580 --> 34:45.291
You're concerned
about their souls now.

34:48.044 --> 34:50.046
I mean, I'll admit,
I've got a stash of them.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.216
Yeah, I don't think
Saint Christopher's gonna do it.

34:53.299 --> 34:55.134
Well, it bears repeating.

34:58.137 --> 34:59.722
The journey never ends.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.519
The hope is real, Josie.

35:05.019 --> 35:07.188
Melanie's getting
off the train to prove it.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.564
Melanie...

35:11.067 --> 35:13.361
When my skin was freezing over,

35:13.444 --> 35:17.949
I curled up, protected this hand...

35:20.409 --> 35:22.537
'cause one fist is all I need.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.136
You're going to be a father.

35:39.971 --> 35:40.972
Your child.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.309
That's a guiding light for all of us.

35:48.396 --> 35:52.108
And if Melanie's mission is our only hope
to ever get off this train,

35:53.234 --> 35:56.154
<i>then our people have a new cause now.</i>

36:58.466 --> 36:59.467
Ruth.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.553
I'll go and prepare the crossing.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.013
Thank you.

37:06.849 --> 37:10.228
Look, I think you know
what your priorities are.

37:10.311 --> 37:14.523
Yeah. You want me to run it by you
to see if I got it? Protect the science.

37:14.607 --> 37:15.608
Number one.

37:15.691 --> 37:19.445
Yeah. To do that, I'll have to hold off
the megalomaniac who created this world

37:19.528 --> 37:21.072
and wants to get power back again,

37:21.155 --> 37:23.950
and he's already
got some supporters on his side.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.577
Yeah, that's about the size of it.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.120
Which leads me to believe

37:28.204 --> 37:30.414
that he didn't want
anybody to get off this train

37:30.498 --> 37:33.125
and recolonize
the Earth in the first place.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.711
Just so we're clear,

37:37.004 --> 37:39.507
success of this mission
will be measured in data,

37:40.675 --> 37:42.176
not my survival.

37:46.514 --> 37:47.932
Good luck, Andre.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.017
Good luck, Melanie.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.820
Pike, you can come on out. I see you.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.908
You caught me on the shitter, brother.

38:06.534 --> 38:10.246
Listen. I want you to link back up
with your connect in the other train.

38:10.329 --> 38:11.372
I'm giving you a pipeline.

38:12.581 --> 38:13.666
Serious?

38:13.749 --> 38:17.670
But only weed. And I get to tell you
what goes the other way.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.965
I won't let you down, man.

38:27.471 --> 38:28.806
You can trust Layton.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.183
He's a good man.

38:32.184 --> 38:35.563
He's just. So are you.

38:37.815 --> 38:41.235
Good men and women don't seem
to stay good long doing this, do they?

38:45.823 --> 38:47.950
Please promise me you'll look after Alex.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.328
I just...

38:52.580 --> 38:55.916
I wanna know someone's... there for her.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.879
It would mean a lot to me if it was you.

39:02.339 --> 39:04.342
-Of course I will.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.719
You have my word.

39:09.513 --> 39:10.681
Thank you.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.691
This is <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

39:20.775 --> 39:22.568
We are ready to cross.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.328
I'm glad you could make it.

39:44.673 --> 39:45.925
Engineer.

39:49.553 --> 39:53.182
We'll all be waiting for you
right here when you get back.

40:23.754 --> 40:26.882
<i>So, you'll recharge the suit</i>
<i>immediately upon arrival.</i>

40:26.966 --> 40:29.677
<i>Assess the damage,</i>
<i>prime the Shelter.</i>

40:30.553 --> 40:33.180
<i>Well, the damage</i>
<i>is what I'm worried about.</i>

40:34.056 --> 40:37.435
<i>I'll find things to improvise</i>
<i>with there.</i> <i>Don't worry.</i>

40:42.314 --> 40:44.650
You know he put
that pressure on you on purpose.

40:45.359 --> 40:47.069
When he made you drive the train,

40:47.695 --> 40:50.448
and when he ordered you
to disconnect <i>Snowpiercer</i>

40:50.531 --> 40:53.242
was 'cause he wanted
all that death on your conscience.

40:55.077 --> 40:57.037
I just want you to know,

40:57.913 --> 41:02.626
that's his cruelty, it is not yours.

41:04.086 --> 41:05.921
Never forget that.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.675
It's not your fault.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.977
I wanted
to keep you here longer.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.730
I wanted to hit the brakes so bad.

41:23.439 --> 41:24.982
But we did what we have to do.

41:34.867 --> 41:36.493
We're not who you think over there.

41:36.577 --> 41:41.373
So, if you ever need anything,
they're people you can trust.

41:43.042 --> 41:44.084
Thank you.

41:46.587 --> 41:48.547
I love you, Allie.

41:54.386 --> 41:56.055
I'll see you in a month, Mom.

42:36.929 --> 42:39.390
-Flare marks the drop point.
<i>All right, guys, here we go.</i>

42:40.224 --> 42:43.936
Fire in three, two, one.
