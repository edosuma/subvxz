is more your territory,

12:46.474 --> 12:47.555

12:47.725 --> 12:48.886

12:52.689 --> 12:54.430
I can tell you
where Thanos is.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.944
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

13:00.571 --> 13:04.611
And when he worked, he talked
about his Great Plan.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.868
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.448
I'd ask...

13:09.998 --> 13:12.661
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

13:13.167 --> 13:15.159
And his answer
was always the same.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.382
"To the Garden."

13:21.050 --> 13:23.758
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

his fingers...

to bring everyone back.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.708
Yeah. Just like that.

13:56.878 --> 14:00.042
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

14:00.214 --> 14:02.922
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.708
If we do this, how do we know

14:04.802 --> 14:07.044
it's gonna end any differently
than it did before?

14:07.221 --> 14:08.837
Because before
you didn't have me.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.637
I can't stop thinking
about it.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.714
What if we could
somehow control the chaos...

32:14.808 --> 32:16.015
and we could navigate it?

32:16.101 --> 32:17.683
What if there was a way...

32:17.769 --> 32:19.385
that we could enter
the quantum realm

32:19.479 --> 32:20.639
at a certain point in time...

32:20.730 --> 32:22.187
but then exit
the quantum realm

32:22.274 --> 32:23.435
at another point in time?

32:23.608 --> 32:24.940
Like...

32:25.694 --> 32:27.777
- Like before Thanos.
- STEVE: Wait.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.528
Are you talking
about a time machine?

32:29.698 --> 32:32.441
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

32:32.617 --> 32:33.653
This is more like a...

32:35.996 --> 32:37.612
Yeah. Like a time machine.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.576
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.783
(STAMMERS) But I can't stop
thinking about it.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.118
There's gotta be...

32:43.879 --> 32:45.245
some way... (SIGHS)

32:45.338 --> 32:47.125
- It's crazy.
- NATASHA: Scott.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.585
I get emails from a raccoon...

32:48.758 --> 32:50.750
so nothing
sounds crazy anymore.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.594
So, who do we talk to
about this?

33:11.865 --> 33:12.946
Chow time!

33:15.410 --> 33:16.446
Maguna.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.189
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

33:23.168 --> 33:24.168
<i>Define "lunch"</i>

33:24.252 --> 33:25.493
<i>- or be disintegrated.</i>
- Okay.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.371
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

33:28.507 --> 33:29.942
That is part of
a special anniversary gift

33:29.966 --> 33:31.047
I'm making for Mom.

33:34.804 --> 33:37.387
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

33:37.557 --> 33:39.619
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

33:39.643 --> 33:41.350
- No.
- That's what you want.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.637
How did you find this?

33:43.813 --> 33:45.645
- Garage.
- Really?

33:45.815 --> 33:47.807
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.559
- I found it, though.
- Hmm.

33:50.737 --> 33:52.478
You like
going in the garage, huh?

33:52.656 --> 33:54.568
So does Daddy. (GRUNTS)

33:54.658 --> 33:57.492
It's fine, actually. Mom never
wears anything I buy her.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.446
So, I'm gonna...

34:18.974 --> 34:21.512
(STAMMERS) No.
We know what it sounds like.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.703
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

34:22.726 --> 34:23.788
is anything really impossible?

34:23.812 --> 34:26.020
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

34:26.188 --> 34:27.909
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

34:27.940 --> 34:28.976
Can we agree on that?

34:29.150 --> 34:30.231
Thank you.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.518
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.103
- I did.
- No.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.147
You accidentally survived.
(SIGHS)

34:36.241 --> 34:38.402
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.661
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

34:43.706 --> 34:45.039
A time heist?

34:45.208 --> 34:47.324
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.688
Why didn't we think
of this before?

34:48.712 --> 34:51.250
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.501
The stones are in the past.

34:53.592 --> 34:54.992
We could go back,
we could get them.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.380
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.466
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

34:59.639 --> 35:00.639
I don't believe we would.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.762
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.351
However, high hopes
won't help...

35:06.521 --> 35:08.478
if there's no logical,
tangible way

35:08.565 --> 35:12.024
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

35:12.193 --> 35:14.059
I believe
the most likely outcome

35:14.154 --> 35:15.214
will be our collective demise.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.072
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.904
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

35:20.994 --> 35:22.530
no betting on sporting events.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.445
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.739
Are you seriously telling me

35:26.833 --> 35:28.620
that your plan
to save the universe...

35:28.793 --> 35:30.455
is based on
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

35:31.588 --> 35:33.329
- Is it?
- No.

35:33.506 --> 35:34.609
Good. You had me
worried there.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.818
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

35:35.842 --> 35:38.129
That's not how
quantum physics works.

35:38.303 --> 35:39.464
Tony.

35:41.431 --> 35:42.888
We have to take a stand.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.424
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.331
SCOTT: I know you got
a lot on the line.

35:49.564 --> 35:52.102
You got a wife, a daughter.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.767
But I lost someone
very important to me.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.526
A lotta people did.

35:56.696 --> 35:59.689
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

35:59.866 --> 36:01.027
to bring everyone back,

36:01.117 --> 36:02.678
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

36:02.702 --> 36:04.489
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.538
- I can't.
- (DOOR CLOSES)

36:07.624 --> 36:08.956
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

36:09.709 --> 36:12.042
MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me
to come and save you.

36:12.128 --> 36:14.541
Good job. I'm saved.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.378
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

36:17.425 --> 36:18.541
Anything else.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.422
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

36:20.512 --> 36:21.878
Oh, look,
the table's set for six.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.462
Tony. I get it.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.927
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.217
But this is a second chance.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.350
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.059
Can't roll the dice on it.

36:35.151 --> 36:37.063
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

36:40.323 --> 36:41.530
Well, he's scared.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.316
STEVE: He's not wrong.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.493
SCOTT: Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

36:45.578 --> 36:47.018
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

36:47.789 --> 36:49.781
No, I wanna do it right.

36:53.002 --> 36:54.664
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

36:55.755 --> 36:56.916
Bigger than his?

36:57.632 --> 36:59.276
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.336
Try some of that.

37:00.427 --> 37:01.427
Have some eggs.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.260
I'm so confused.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.087
These are confusing times.
(CHUCKLES)

37:05.181 --> 37:07.093
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.759
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

37:10.353 --> 37:12.140
I know, it's crazy.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.520
I'm wearing shirts now.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.524
Yeah. What? How? Why?

37:16.985 --> 37:19.318
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.562
Except it was worse for me...

37:21.740 --> 37:22.947
'cause I lost twice.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.903
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

37:25.785 --> 37:27.117
and then, we all lost.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.444
No one blamed you, Bruce.

37:28.621 --> 37:29.987
I did.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.060
For years,
I've been treating the Hulk

37:33.084 --> 37:34.270
like he's
some kind of disease...

37:34.294 --> 37:35.751
something to get rid of.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.167
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.875
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

37:42.051 --> 37:44.634
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

37:44.804 --> 37:46.045
and now, look at me.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.430
Best of both worlds.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.516
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.017
Can we get a photo?

37:52.437 --> 37:54.429
100%, little person.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.643
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

37:57.358 --> 37:59.099
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- SMART HULK: Thanks.

37:59.194 --> 38:00.776
Say "green."

38:00.945 --> 38:03.187
- FANS: Green.
- Green.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.281
Did you get that?

38:04.449 --> 38:05.690
That's a good one.

38:06.493 --> 38:08.735
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.327
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

38:14.417 --> 38:15.644
- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take

38:15.668 --> 38:17.438
- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

38:17.462 --> 38:18.543
BOY 1: Stranger danger.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.232
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.317
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

38:21.341 --> 38:22.457
But come on. The kid...

38:22.550 --> 38:23.961
I don't want a picture
with them.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.196
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.614
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.240
SCOTT: I don't want to do it.
BOY 2: We can do it.

38:28.264 --> 38:30.367
- SMART HULK: No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

38:30.391 --> 38:31.598
SMART HULK: Okay.

38:31.684 --> 38:32.724
GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

38:32.769 --> 38:34.872
SMART HULK: No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.262
ALL: Hulk out!

38:36.439 --> 38:37.475
STEVE: Bruce.

38:37.899 --> 38:38.899
Dab.

38:39.234 --> 38:40.850
- Bruce.
- Listen to your mom.

38:41.236 --> 38:42.236
She knows better.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.065
About what we were saying.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.446
Right.

38:47.408 --> 38:50.071
The whole time travel do-over?

38:51.371 --> 38:55.115
Eh, guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.824
Well, you pulled this off.

38:57.877 --> 39:01.666
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

39:34.956 --> 39:36.492
I've got a mild inspiration.

39:36.583 --> 39:37.869
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.042
So, I'd like to run
one last sim

39:40.128 --> 39:41.710
before we pack it in
for the night.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.873

of that particle...

39:53.641 --> 39:55.633
factoring in spectral decomp.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.767
- That'll take a second.

doing up, little miss?

- Shit.
- Nope. We don't say that.

Only Mommy says that word.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.712
She coined it.
It belongs to her.

Why are you up?

'Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!

Why do you think?

40:33.890 --> 40:35.426
No, I got something
on my mind.

40:35.516 --> 40:36.848
I got something on my mind.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.554
Was it juice pops?

40:40.104 --> 40:41.311
Sure was.

40:42.732 --> 40:44.473
That's extortion.
That's a word.

40:45.985 --> 40:46.985
Great minds think alike.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.985
Juice pops exactly...

40:51.157 --> 40:52.273

about the same thing...

with the Aether.

Uh, where to start? Um...

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:50.260
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.557
Someone called it
a stone before.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:57.938
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.724
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:00.979
and stop saying that.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:03.982
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:06.021
My grandfather,
many years ago...

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:09.692

from the Dark Elves.

Ooh. (CHUCKLES) Scary beings.

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:14.454

Oh, there she is.

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:20.411
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:24.627
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:27.635
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:29.841
and she became
very, very sick.

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:31.881
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:33.136
which is where I'm from...

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.267
and we had to try and fix her.

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:37.053
We were dating at the time,
you see...

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:40.598
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:43.980

01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:46.896

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.902

a few things along the way.

with this thing...

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.557

The wine cellar
is just down here.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:56.307
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:57.920
I'll see if the scullery has
a couple of to-go cups.

Yes, milady.

from the astronomy shelf.

That's my mother.

She dies today.

- Come here.
- No, no, no.

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.901
I think I'm having

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:53.826
I lost the only family
I ever had.

the chick with the antenna...

who are only kind of gone...

02:47:39.299 --> 02:47:40.881
Thank you.

02:47:42.594 --> 02:47:43.880
I'll do my best.

02:47:49.268 --> 02:47:51.180
That's why it's yours.

02:47:52.896 --> 02:47:54.262
You wanna tell me about her?

02:48:00.862 --> 02:48:02.353
No.

02:48:02.781 --> 02:48:04.898
No, I don't think I will.
