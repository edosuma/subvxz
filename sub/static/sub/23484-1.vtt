00:48.375 --> 00:51.365
A woman? Of course.

00:51.445 --> 00:53.784
But is she human?

00:53.864 --> 00:56.955
Well, that's another story.

00:57.035 --> 01:00.257
The Gotham Gaiety Girls presents...

01:00.337 --> 01:02.956
...Ivy, the Plant Lady.

01:08.389 --> 01:11.201
But be warned, fellas.

01:11.281 --> 01:13.538
This ivy is poison.

01:13.618 --> 01:16.701
Dare you taste her forbidden fruit?

01:38.008 --> 01:41.625
Disarm them all already.
Let's see those leaves fall.

02:38.353 --> 02:40.199
You gave me a start.

02:40.279 --> 02:42.492
I thought for a minute...

02:42.572 --> 02:45.395
Well, you're clearly a real gentleman.

02:45.475 --> 02:49.533
You lonely? I hate to see a man lonely.

02:49.613 --> 02:52.070
I got a generous nature.

02:52.150 --> 02:54.505
And I'm sure you're generous too.

02:54.585 --> 02:56.336
Ain't ya, mister?

03:00.257 --> 03:02.076
My room's not far.

03:04.262 --> 03:06.914
Or maybe you don't want to wait.

03:15.572 --> 03:18.397
No. No! No!

03:19.877 --> 03:22.733
You took the shortcut
through outsider's territory.

03:22.833 --> 03:26.183
You gotta pay the tariff.
Ain't that right, Dickie?

03:26.263 --> 03:30.140
Name's Jason. 'Member?
We don't say our names.

03:30.220 --> 03:34.379
Oh, let's go back to the flop, fellas.
It's getting awful late.

03:34.459 --> 03:37.082
Don't go yellow on me, boy...

03:37.162 --> 03:39.450
...or you know what you'll get.

03:39.530 --> 03:42.416
Don't you worry, Bill. We're on the job.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.556
What are you scared of the dark, Little Tim?

03:45.636 --> 03:48.593
Nah, it's just... after what
happened to Johnny Gobbs, I...

03:48.673 --> 03:51.449
That ain't real, Timmy.
He's like Santa Claus.

03:51.529 --> 03:55.700
Just a story they tell to keep young turfs
like us from making an honest living.

03:55.780 --> 03:59.070
Oh, he's real, all right.
That's why you gotta pay us.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.129
For protecting you from monsters.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.068
Now pay up.

04:06.624 --> 04:08.632
I think we might have broke 'em, boys.

04:08.712 --> 04:10.480
Bat!

04:15.500 --> 04:17.317
Holy shit!

04:18.235 --> 04:20.052
Stick 'im, boys.

04:42.582 --> 04:45.415
You're the galumph who's been
making a nuisance of yourself...

04:45.495 --> 04:47.508
...all over Gotham, ain't ya?

04:47.588 --> 04:51.655
Well, now you're
in Big Bill Dust's territory...

04:51.735 --> 04:55.026
...interfering with my amiable Cock Robins.

04:55.106 --> 04:57.062
You're bad for business.

04:57.142 --> 04:59.573
Bad all 'round.

05:01.429 --> 05:04.064
Too bad for you.

05:27.588 --> 05:30.394
- Go home.
- Am home.

05:30.474 --> 05:32.429
Home to mommy.

05:32.509 --> 05:34.931
He ain't got one. None of us do.

05:35.011 --> 05:37.535
Or we run off from something
even worse than this.

05:37.615 --> 05:40.605
This is our family now.
Making something here.

05:40.685 --> 05:44.672
- Taking something back from Gotham.
- Make something else.

05:44.752 --> 05:47.812
- Something better.
- We got no choice.

05:47.892 --> 05:50.724
He'll just chase us down, find us again.

05:55.249 --> 05:58.272
He won't be chasing anyone for a long time.

05:58.352 --> 06:01.888
Go to St. Caduales, ask for Sister Leslie.

06:01.973 --> 06:03.788
She'll help you.

06:05.175 --> 06:07.227
Get off the street, now!

06:58.528 --> 07:03.020
Blood, sweat and tears.

07:03.100 --> 07:07.194
That's what turned this dream
into a magnificent reality, gentlemen.

07:07.274 --> 07:09.720
That and Bruce Wayne's money.

07:13.411 --> 07:16.867
Spoken like a true,
county prosecutor, Mr. Dent.

07:16.947 --> 07:18.637
Money always helps.

07:18.717 --> 07:22.406
But it is the ingenuity
of the city's captains of industry...

07:22.486 --> 07:24.212
...that provided these marvels.

07:24.292 --> 07:28.309
And may you select few truly
enjoy this special preview...

07:28.389 --> 07:31.010
...of the Gotham World's Fair.

08:12.737 --> 08:15.055
The stairway to heaven.

08:15.135 --> 08:18.529
A fully electronical lantern,
bright enough to illuminate...

08:18.609 --> 08:20.898
...the very celestial firmament above.

08:20.978 --> 08:25.486
Higher even than the police department's
new lighter-than-air patrol craft.

08:25.566 --> 08:26.772
Let's see it.

08:26.852 --> 08:30.891
The light tends to show off a bit better
in the night time, Ambrose.

08:30.971 --> 08:34.477
But here's a sight you needn't
wait to marvel at.

08:34.558 --> 08:37.465
Gotham's own answer to the Eiffel Tower.

08:37.544 --> 08:41.818
The fox wheel will elevate you
two hundred and fifty feet into the sky...

08:41.899 --> 08:46.376
...at the astonishing rate
of 15 miles an hour.

08:46.456 --> 08:50.201
Heavens! Can the human body
even survive that kind of motion?

08:50.281 --> 08:54.885
Most certainly, ma'am. I refer you to medical
expert and Gotham's premier alienist...

08:54.965 --> 08:56.816
...Dr. Hugo Strange.

08:56.896 --> 09:01.171
The human organs can withstand
velocities up to 35 miles per hour.

09:01.251 --> 09:05.875
Ride the wheel, and I give you my
guarantee as a physician and surgeon...

09:05.955 --> 09:08.959
- ...you will live.
- It's a shame you won't provide...

09:09.039 --> 09:12.683
...this same assurance
to the ladies of Gotham, Mr. Mayor.

09:12.763 --> 09:15.770
Women are being gutted
in the streets like wild game...

09:15.850 --> 09:19.484
...and the Gotham police
stand twiddling their thumbs.

09:19.564 --> 09:23.744
I'm sure Ms. Kyle's lovely voice is better
suited to the stage of the Monarch Theater...

09:23.824 --> 09:26.504
- ...than a city council meeting.
- Mr. Dent...

09:26.584 --> 09:30.117
Sure, and no ladies
have been killed, Ms. Kyle.

09:30.197 --> 09:33.339
Some gin-soaked women of the street
have met their fate.

09:33.419 --> 09:37.042
- As is common to their kind.
- Belay that, Chief.

09:38.122 --> 09:42.378
Ms. Kyle, I assure you visitors
to this fair, men and women alike...

09:42.458 --> 09:46.468
- ...will be safe from...
- Jack. Jack the Ripper.

09:46.548 --> 09:50.277
That's what he calls himself in the letter
he sent the Gotham Gazette, isn't it?

09:50.357 --> 09:54.027
Now, Sister Leslie,
that letter's likely just another hoax.

09:54.107 --> 09:58.478
Really, Bulldog? Strange it would arrive
with a human kidney in the envelope.

09:58.958 --> 10:01.798
There's a butcher in this town
preying on poor women.

10:01.878 --> 10:05.039
And if you don't stop him,
so help me, I'll raise holy hell.

10:05.119 --> 10:08.454
Sister, your selfless dedication
to Gotham's poor is...

10:08.534 --> 10:09.974
Poor is the word.

10:10.054 --> 10:13.547
If these murdered ladies were from
Crest Hill instead of Skinner's End...

10:13.627 --> 10:15.712
...you'd have the killer by now.

10:15.792 --> 10:19.540
My men are working triple shifts combing
every inch of this city for this mad man.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.800
You know I've pledged to clean up
Gotham and I mean all of it.

10:22.880 --> 10:26.554
It's that bat creature we've been
reading about. That's who it is.

10:26.634 --> 10:28.809
That could very well be.

10:28.889 --> 10:31.564
He's a devil, that one.
My men just can't seem to...

10:31.644 --> 10:35.298
To do anything, Chief Bullock,
but sit on their fat arses and...

10:35.378 --> 10:37.083
Just a damn minute.

10:37.163 --> 10:40.964
Your charity house is what draws
these pests in in the first...

10:45.055 --> 10:48.979
Well, as I live and breathe.
If it isn't himself.

10:49.059 --> 10:53.516
Welcome! A hearty welcome
to Gotham's favorite native son.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.753
Bruce Wayne.

10:55.833 --> 10:58.122
Thank you, thank you, Mayor Tolliver.

10:58.202 --> 11:02.819
Please don't stop on my account.
You know I like to keep a low profile.

11:03.874 --> 11:06.129
I heard about this
little city council meeting...

11:06.209 --> 11:09.582
...and thought it was a good opportunity
to see how my money was being spent...

11:09.662 --> 11:12.598
...and all I see is sour faces.

11:14.884 --> 11:16.807
Think nothing of that, my boy.

11:16.887 --> 11:19.876
They're just a few disruptive
females in attendance.

11:19.956 --> 11:23.214
Don't worry, sir. I was just about
to have them escorted away.

11:23.294 --> 11:24.995
Leslie!

11:28.098 --> 11:30.167
You were saying, Chief?

11:31.702 --> 11:35.580
There were newspapers in Europe, James.
Is it as bad as I read?

11:35.660 --> 11:38.995
Worse. Despite your best efforts
with this World's Fair.

11:39.075 --> 11:42.166
...the city seems to be getting
more deplorable every day.

11:42.246 --> 11:47.271
First, this masked Batman vigilante,
then this Jack the Ripper lunatic.

11:47.351 --> 11:49.939
- They're not the same man?
- Rubbish.

11:50.019 --> 11:54.677
The parish home is full of unfortunates who
swear the Batman saved them from the gangs.

11:54.757 --> 11:58.548
- He's on the side of the angels.
- This Ripper, however, is not.

11:58.628 --> 12:02.418
I've seen the bodies, Bruce.
Cut to pieces, like an autopsy.

12:02.498 --> 12:04.984
Just absolutely appalling.

12:06.602 --> 12:09.375
Strange the top man at Arkham
tells us he's never seen...

12:09.455 --> 12:11.675
...this kind of controlled savagery before.

12:16.529 --> 12:20.303
Bruce, the latest victim
was one of our orphanage girls.

12:20.383 --> 12:22.045
It was Pamela.

12:22.125 --> 12:24.290
What? No.

12:24.370 --> 12:27.381
You wrote me. You said she was working.

12:27.461 --> 12:30.730
Dancing, then the opium.

12:31.060 --> 12:32.912
And now...

12:33.362 --> 12:36.044
- We can't save them all.
- I'm sorry, Bruce.

12:36.124 --> 12:38.639
I know those orphans are close to your heart.

12:38.719 --> 12:41.888
If I didn't have Sister Leslie
when my parents...

12:43.273 --> 12:45.947
...funding the orphanage
is the least I could do.

12:46.527 --> 12:49.149
And now you're back in the manor.

12:49.229 --> 12:52.740
Too remote. I've a town house on Bell Avenue.

12:52.820 --> 12:56.406
I look forward to showing it to you.
Unfortunately, tonight I have to...

12:56.486 --> 12:59.592
Don't say another word.
I'll not hear you lie.

12:59.672 --> 13:02.663
And a rich bachelor is always up to no good.

13:03.143 --> 13:06.167
I'm afraid it's unavoidable.
Isn't that right, Alfred?

13:06.247 --> 13:09.202
Your evening attire
has already been laid out, sir.

13:09.282 --> 13:11.422
Well, duty calls, I'm afraid.

13:11.502 --> 13:15.275
Do you suppose his pressing business
is blonde, brunette, or a redhead?

13:15.355 --> 13:18.707
James Gordon,
you've got a dirty mind, you do.

13:19.493 --> 13:21.694
My money's on blonde.

17:27.106 --> 17:30.642
- I hope you're unharmed, miss.
- Damn you.

17:36.515 --> 17:39.846
You're a fool. I'll never have a better
chance of stopping that butcher...

17:39.926 --> 17:42.942
...and you squandered it,
playing the knight in shining armor.

17:43.022 --> 17:45.511
I can take care of myself.

17:45.591 --> 17:49.198
Don't be so sure. He's more skilled
than I would have thought.

17:49.278 --> 17:51.817
I don't need or want your help.

17:51.897 --> 17:53.986
And before you gallantly offer
to escort me home...

17:54.066 --> 17:56.919
...let me assure you,
I am quite capable of...

18:00.089 --> 18:02.775
Well, thank you for that at least.

18:15.122 --> 18:16.705
Barbara!

18:20.059 --> 18:21.627
Barbara.

18:22.978 --> 18:26.466
Hush! The children don't have
to be up for hours.

18:31.805 --> 18:33.826
What is it, James? What's wrong?

18:33.906 --> 18:36.250
Dream. Just a dream.

18:36.330 --> 18:38.795
And then, you were gone.

18:42.716 --> 18:44.534
I'm all right, dear.

18:47.670 --> 18:51.244
James, these hours, you're working too hard.

18:51.324 --> 18:53.212
And that's not likely to change.

18:53.292 --> 18:57.297
I can't very well sit at home
while Gotham goes straight to hell.

18:58.214 --> 19:00.884
No, you couldn't, could you?

19:01.618 --> 19:03.486
I'll make your eggs.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.962
- Damnation!
- Don't be alarmed.

19:19.042 --> 19:21.607
So says the man dressed up like a bat.

19:21.687 --> 19:25.978
I'm on your side, Commissioner.
I mean to rid Gotham of the Ripper.

19:26.058 --> 19:29.616
Really? And who'll help me rid Gotham of you?

19:29.696 --> 19:32.269
Your men don't search too hard for me.

19:32.349 --> 19:34.769
I'm betting that comes from the top down.

19:35.219 --> 19:38.868
Back in the union camp at Culpepper,
soldiers would sometimes ignore...

19:38.948 --> 19:42.624
...a feral cat just to keep
the rat population in check.

19:43.143 --> 19:45.165
Other times, we'd eat them.

19:45.245 --> 19:47.570
I know a vigilante from a maniac.

19:47.650 --> 19:51.704
This Ripper is far worse
than the lunatic you're searching for.

19:51.784 --> 19:55.249
He's a skilled hunter,
and he's just getting started.

19:55.329 --> 19:58.678
You ought to have breakfast
with Hugo Strange up at Arkham Asylum.

19:58.758 --> 20:02.752
You can compare useless theories.
I prefer facts.

20:02.832 --> 20:05.268
I ran into your Ripper earlier this evening.

20:05.348 --> 20:09.356
Approximately 6'3", 250 pounds, left handed.

20:09.436 --> 20:13.292
Good fighter. Trained, not just a brawler.

20:13.872 --> 20:17.964
- You didn't happen to see his face, did you?
- I need your files on the Ripper.

20:18.044 --> 20:20.065
Detailed descriptions of the crime scene...

20:20.145 --> 20:23.106
...photo plates,
even profiles from your alienist.

20:23.186 --> 20:26.856
Would you prefer them alphabetized
or in chronological order?

20:26.936 --> 20:28.947
- James?
- Stay inside, Barbara.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.857
I'll be in directly.

20:31.861 --> 20:36.011
Every woman in Gotham
is in danger, Commissioner.

20:37.714 --> 20:40.070
A letter from Jack to the Gotham Gazette.

20:40.150 --> 20:42.671
We've convinced them
to refrain from publishing it.

20:42.751 --> 20:45.298
Makes poor bedtime reading, I assure you.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.861
Perhaps you'll find
something of use in there.

20:47.941 --> 20:49.228
Thank you.

20:49.308 --> 20:52.682
I'll leave a copy of the Ripper file
on the roof of the police station.

20:52.762 --> 20:55.054
I know you fancy rooftops.

20:55.134 --> 20:59.405
But understand that this uninvited visit
to my home will not be repeated.

20:59.485 --> 21:01.675
This house is my refuge...

21:01.755 --> 21:04.503
...set apart from all
the corruption of Got...

21:06.393 --> 21:10.567
James, your eggs are ready.
Are you sure you won't come inside?

21:10.647 --> 21:13.066
Yes, yes. I'm coming.

21:19.105 --> 21:23.095
"Dear Boss, Gotham has become
a den of filth and scum.

21:23.175 --> 21:28.034
I'm down on whores and I shan't quit
ripping them till I do get buckled.

21:28.114 --> 21:33.105
Grand work, the last job was.
I hardly gave the lady no time to squeal.

21:33.185 --> 21:34.775
How can they catch me now?

21:34.855 --> 21:39.178
I love my work, cutting whores and then
degenerates what with defend them."

21:39.258 --> 21:41.180
A little light reading, Master Bruce?

21:41.260 --> 21:44.401
"Them cusses' of coppers
nor the false God you hide behind...

21:44.481 --> 21:48.188
...won't spoil the game for me.
I will be on a job soon...

21:48.268 --> 21:51.134
...and will send you another bit of innards."

21:52.022 --> 21:55.952
Goes on like that in some detail
about his dissection plans.

21:56.032 --> 21:58.198
Mrs. Cooper has sent up a portage.

21:58.278 --> 22:02.623
<i>Bon appetit.</i> And what do you deduce
from this <i>magnum opus?</i>

22:02.703 --> 22:04.337
Very little.

22:04.417 --> 22:06.473
Cheap paper with no watermark.

22:06.553 --> 22:11.411
The hand is that of a man with some education
disguised to look like a man with none.

22:11.491 --> 22:14.542
I'm certain your displays
of graphology would duly impress...

22:14.622 --> 22:17.351
...any young ladies you encounter.

22:17.431 --> 22:20.313
Women are a distraction
from the mission, Alfred.

22:20.967 --> 22:23.936
So you've said. Your evening attire, sir.

22:26.506 --> 22:29.413
I believe you know that was not
the suit I was referring to...

22:29.493 --> 22:31.854
...when I said I'd be
going out tonight, Alfred.

22:31.934 --> 22:34.484
I've taken the liberty
of placing your other suit...

22:34.564 --> 22:36.769
...in the seat compartment
of the carriage, sir.

22:36.849 --> 22:41.475
Before the Batman can prowl, I'm afraid,
Bruce Wayne must needs make an appearance.

22:41.555 --> 22:43.206
Tongues will wag.

22:43.286 --> 22:46.030
What engagement have I accepted?

22:46.410 --> 22:50.041
You are carousing with the lively
man-about-town and rake...

22:50.121 --> 22:52.869
...your oldest school chum,
Master Harvey Dent.

22:52.949 --> 22:54.798
Gotham's solicitor.

22:55.885 --> 23:00.590
I'm certain you shall have a pleasant
and elegant evening's entertainment, sir.

23:10.050 --> 23:14.408
<i>When the circus came to town
Jay Augustus Henpecked Brown</i>

23:14.488 --> 23:18.735
<i>Bought himself a ticket for the show</i>

23:18.815 --> 23:22.982
<i>Passed by all the acrobats
All the clowns in funny hats</i>

23:23.062 --> 23:27.287
<i>Went to see the animals below</i>

23:27.367 --> 23:31.725
<i>Saw a tamer put his head into a lion's mouth</i>

23:31.805 --> 23:35.676
<i>Waited till the tamer man was through</i>

23:35.756 --> 23:40.149
<i>Shook his hand and said,
"at taming wild ones, you're a bird</i>

23:40.229 --> 23:43.953
<i>"But just one thing I'd like to ask of you"</i>

23:44.033 --> 23:48.291
<i>Can you tame Wild Wimmen?</i>

23:48.371 --> 23:52.945
<i>Can you tame Wild Wimmen?</i>

23:53.025 --> 23:57.283
<i>You made a tiger stand
And eat out of your hand</i>

23:57.363 --> 24:01.027
<i>You made the hippo do the flippo
Honest, it was grand</i>

24:01.107 --> 24:05.591
<i>Can you tame Wild Wimmen?</i>

24:05.671 --> 24:08.979
<i>So they'll always lead
A sweet and simple life</i>

24:09.059 --> 24:11.113
Bruce, I'm in love.

24:11.193 --> 24:14.470
Well, that's great news, Harvey.
I'm sure your wife will be glad to hear it.

24:14.550 --> 24:17.486
Oh, please, Bruce. This is the 19th century.

24:17.616 --> 24:19.838
Don't be such a dinosaur.

24:19.918 --> 24:22.142
Marriage is more like a business arrangement.

24:22.222 --> 24:26.074
Besides, what Gilda doesn't know,
won't hurt her.

24:29.762 --> 24:34.199
Selina is the most amazing gal,
Bruce. You'll see.

24:34.783 --> 24:36.819
I think I already do.

24:41.540 --> 24:45.405
Just make yourselves at home,
gentlemen. I'll make myself decent.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.847
I certainly hope not.

24:49.481 --> 24:52.771
Did you enjoy my performance, Mr. Wayne?

24:52.851 --> 24:57.131
Bruce. And I'm told you also gave
quite an impassioned performance...

24:57.211 --> 24:58.919
...at the World's Fair preview.

24:58.999 --> 25:01.964
I'm passionate in everything I do, Bruce.

25:02.044 --> 25:04.763
And boss Tolliver needed to get the message.

25:13.056 --> 25:15.917
Come on, my pet.
Let's see if we can't make our way...

25:15.997 --> 25:20.482
...to a more comfortable establishment
before Gordon's killjoy curfew takes effect.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.635
Listen carefully, kitten...

25:22.715 --> 25:27.235
...I'm many things but I'm nobody's pet.

25:35.535 --> 25:39.051
And you can't doubt for one minute
that if men were being slaughtered...

25:39.131 --> 25:42.789
...Tolliver would hire an army
of policemen to find this Ripper.

25:42.869 --> 25:44.311
But I don't agree.

25:44.391 --> 25:48.794
If it were affluent women, society ladies,
the outcry might be deafening.

25:48.874 --> 25:51.998
Jack targets destitute women.

25:52.078 --> 25:54.750
When the voiceless cry out, no one hears.

25:54.830 --> 25:58.688
I think you're ignoring
the real tragedy here.

25:59.118 --> 26:02.471
Every establishment in town is closing down.

26:04.691 --> 26:08.313
What a shame. I was starting to suspect
that there was more to your friend...

26:08.393 --> 26:11.434
...than a good family name
and prep school manners.

26:11.514 --> 26:13.803
Well, there's the Wayne fortune.

26:13.883 --> 26:16.772
But I'm sure you didn't forget that,
did you, Selina?

26:16.852 --> 26:18.887
Steady, old man.

26:20.072 --> 26:21.961
You'll have to excuse Harvey.

26:22.041 --> 26:26.765
Oh, I know. When he drinks,
he's an entirely different person.

26:26.845 --> 26:29.080
A regular Jekyll and Hyde.

26:34.484 --> 26:37.611
This is my club. We can catch a hansom here.

26:37.691 --> 26:42.014
I'd invite you in for a drink but,
unfortunately, men only.

26:42.094 --> 26:44.946
At least we still have something.

26:46.833 --> 26:49.719
I didn't take you for an anti-suffragist.

26:58.261 --> 27:01.668
I don't think the doorman
was quite convinced that I'm a man.

27:01.748 --> 27:04.753
If he was, I'd have to have him dismissed.

27:04.833 --> 27:09.638
The Dionysus Club cannot tolerate
a doorman who is blind.

27:09.718 --> 27:12.878
You'd never do that. Have someone fired.

27:12.958 --> 27:15.625
You're too kind. I've heard.

27:16.162 --> 27:17.384
You don't know me.

27:17.464 --> 27:20.819
I know most other men would've
abandoned Harvey hours ago.

27:20.899 --> 27:23.857
- Well, we've all had a few.
- You haven't.

27:23.937 --> 27:27.377
You've been pouring your drinks
in potted plants all night.

27:27.957 --> 27:33.065
A mutual friend told me you like to solve
mysteries, ever since you were a boy.

27:33.145 --> 27:35.230
You're studying me.

27:36.315 --> 27:38.271
You're a fascinating subject.

27:38.351 --> 27:40.640
And what have you learned?

27:40.720 --> 27:43.642
Only that you were raised
in a small, regional circus...

27:43.722 --> 27:45.644
...probably in a family of performers.

27:45.724 --> 27:49.101
That some traumatic event possibly
connected to the scar on your left arm...

27:49.181 --> 27:51.975
...that you're trying to conceal,
led you to the continent...

27:52.055 --> 27:55.038
...where you reinvented yourself
as a night club performer.

27:55.118 --> 27:56.690
Nothing else?

27:57.370 --> 28:01.927
That you take it upon yourself
to act as champion of the voiceless.

28:02.007 --> 28:06.632
Which you, no doubt, learned from our
mutual friend, Sister Leslie Thompkins.

28:06.812 --> 28:09.365
One of the few people who knew me as a boy.

28:09.445 --> 28:12.989
Yes. She was the one
who told me you were kind.

28:13.069 --> 28:16.309
And she should know. She took me in too.

28:16.389 --> 28:19.511
She takes in all of the helpless,
the hopeless...

28:19.641 --> 28:22.078
...feeds them, protects them.

28:23.295 --> 28:25.925
- I've been a fool.
- Bruce, what?

28:26.005 --> 28:28.017
Fetch me a hansom, quickly.

29:02.601 --> 29:05.457
Oh, Sister. You gave me a fright.

29:05.537 --> 29:07.627
Marlene, what are you doing here?

29:07.707 --> 29:11.113
A warm cot is waiting for you
and you're out here in the cold.

29:11.493 --> 29:13.398
You've been at the bottle.

29:13.478 --> 29:17.189
I'm sorry, Sister.
I was having trouble sleeping.

29:17.269 --> 29:19.323
I needed my medicine.

29:20.023 --> 29:24.840
I don't know where you're hiding it, but
your sort of medicine will kill you for sure.

29:25.188 --> 29:27.225
Back to bed with ya.

29:49.582 --> 29:51.395
Keep it, don't wait.

30:43.036 --> 30:44.904
So, this is it then.

30:48.390 --> 30:51.230
Well, I won't beg...

30:51.310 --> 30:53.702
...and I won't go hysterical.

30:54.212 --> 30:56.648
I won't give you the satisfaction.

31:01.420 --> 31:03.238
Know this...

31:04.806 --> 31:06.626
...I forgive you.

31:37.756 --> 31:41.042
Master Bruce, I took the liberty of...

32:05.183 --> 32:09.789
- Bruce, I know how much Sister Leslie...
- What, Alfred? What did you say?

32:11.439 --> 32:12.725
Nothing at all, sir.

32:12.805 --> 32:17.147
I presumed and I presumed incorrectly.
What have you there?

32:17.227 --> 32:20.252
It's a membership pin from the Dionysus Club.

32:20.332 --> 32:22.054
It was at the scene.

32:22.134 --> 32:25.455
The Batman will return it
to Gordon after my analysis.

32:25.535 --> 32:28.540
Yours? You were there,
you might've dropped it.

32:29.192 --> 32:32.281
No. There's blood splattered on the pin.

32:32.361 --> 32:35.308
It was there when the murder
happened. Mine wasn't.

32:35.388 --> 32:38.297
This does, however,
narrow the field considerably.

32:38.377 --> 32:41.391
Including the Mayor,
Harvey, even Hugo Strange.

32:41.471 --> 32:43.729
Virtually every wealthy man in Gotham.

32:43.809 --> 32:46.896
Testing your fingerprints theory again?

32:46.976 --> 32:50.236
You know, they'll never admit
that sort of thing as evidence.

32:50.316 --> 32:53.987
There are no prints,
just a few fibers in the fastener.

32:54.267 --> 32:56.239
If I could match these...

32:56.319 --> 32:59.742
It will have to wait.
I've laid out your mourning clothes.

32:59.822 --> 33:02.074
I have my own manner of mourning.

33:03.076 --> 33:06.699
- Revenge.
- Her blood cries out for it.

33:06.779 --> 33:08.267
Does it, sir?

33:08.347 --> 33:11.987
"Beloved, avenge not yourselves,
vengeance is mine.

33:12.067 --> 33:15.103
"I will repay," sayeth the Lord.

33:16.522 --> 33:19.127
She wouldn't want you to be alone right now.

33:19.357 --> 33:21.576
It's how I work best, Alfred.

33:31.771 --> 33:33.973
But I can pay my respects.

33:40.195 --> 33:43.118
For as much as it hath
pleased almighty God...

33:43.198 --> 33:45.388
...of his great mercy...

33:45.468 --> 33:50.693
...to take unto himself the soul
of our dear sister here departed.

33:50.773 --> 33:53.496
We therefore commit her body to the ground.

33:54.543 --> 33:56.465
Earth to earth.

33:56.545 --> 33:58.004
Ashes to ashes.

33:58.084 --> 33:59.885
Dust to dust.

34:00.515 --> 34:04.507
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life...

34:04.587 --> 34:06.968
...through our Lord Jesus Christ...

34:07.323 --> 34:09.761
...who shall change
the body of our low estate...

34:09.841 --> 34:13.928
...that it may be like
unto his glorious body.

34:14.597 --> 34:16.101
Amen.

34:16.181 --> 34:17.699
Amen.

34:34.466 --> 34:36.100
Mr. Wayne?

34:38.335 --> 34:40.625
Dr. Hugo Strange, isn't it?

34:41.922 --> 34:42.967
You know me.

34:43.047 --> 34:47.449
I read your monograph on the habits
of the clinically degenerate lunatics.

34:47.529 --> 34:50.569
You believe their cure lies in surgery.

34:50.649 --> 34:53.523
Ablation of the frontal cortex.

34:53.603 --> 34:56.312
The scalpel solves everything.

34:56.391 --> 35:01.393
- You knew Sister Leslie?
- No, I came for professional reasons.

35:05.848 --> 35:09.371
He is here. I am certain of it.

35:09.451 --> 35:10.826
Jack.

35:10.906 --> 35:15.478
His sick mind burns with the hatred
of all that he sees as evil and wicked.

35:15.558 --> 35:19.115
Hatred of women. A hunger that never dies.

35:19.195 --> 35:22.920
It is strong. Overpowering.

35:23.381 --> 35:26.939
- You know who he is?
- Pardon me, Mr. Wayne.

35:27.019 --> 35:29.674
The Commissioner was wondering
if you'll be coming to the memorial.

35:29.754 --> 35:31.609
Yes, Chief. I'll be right there.

35:35.710 --> 35:37.016
Well?

35:37.096 --> 35:39.726
I should very much like to tell this...

35:39.806 --> 35:44.363
...Batman I've heard so much
about all that I know.

35:44.953 --> 35:48.200
- Then why come to...
- You know everyone in town, Mr. Wayne.

35:48.280 --> 35:53.172
I'm sure you could find a way to tell
the Batman to come to my office.

35:53.252 --> 35:55.587
Tonight. Midnight.

35:55.667 --> 35:57.949
Strange, I don't know who...

36:10.424 --> 36:12.118
Gotcha.

36:12.198 --> 36:14.403
Let me go, geezer.

36:14.763 --> 36:18.340
I'm afraid you lack the subtlety to be an
effective cat purse, young fellow, my lad.

36:18.420 --> 36:21.287
And so near a bevy of policeman, too.

36:22.110 --> 36:24.027
He didn't mean nothing, mister.

36:24.107 --> 36:28.119
You idiot. You think that's how Sister Leslie
would want you to act at her own funeral?

36:28.199 --> 36:29.702
But I'm hungry.

36:29.782 --> 36:32.521
Mister, Jason here is not worth the trouble.

36:32.601 --> 36:34.623
Cut him loose, huh?

36:34.703 --> 36:35.859
Orphans.

36:36.689 --> 36:38.661
Sister Leslie did what she could for us.

36:38.741 --> 36:41.381
Fed us, tried to teach us right.

36:41.911 --> 36:45.101
Look, knock Jason around
a little if you want, but...

36:45.181 --> 36:47.382
...please don't get the cops.

36:49.618 --> 36:52.321
I occasionally have odd jobs that need doing.

36:52.722 --> 36:54.443
Call upon me here.

36:54.523 --> 36:56.437
You'll not go away hungry.

36:57.759 --> 36:59.327
Shoo.

37:02.697 --> 37:06.444
- Not so hasty, if you please.
- What?

37:06.524 --> 37:10.559
I know I'm too old now to catch
the eye of a gent like you.

37:10.689 --> 37:13.261
But my eyes are still good, yeah?

37:13.341 --> 37:15.663
They see everything.

37:15.743 --> 37:19.335
- I don't quite follow.
- Of course, my memory ain't so great.

37:19.415 --> 37:22.621
I forget things all the time
for the right price.

37:22.701 --> 37:24.940
Follow me, Mr. Bruce Wayne?

37:25.020 --> 37:28.193
I recognized you sneaking
around the church yard.

37:29.223 --> 37:32.114
- I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
- Afraid?

37:32.194 --> 37:36.719
Oh, you'll be afraid all right,
Mr. High and Mighty Bruce Wayne.

37:36.839 --> 37:39.581
When I tell the coppers what I know!

37:41.139 --> 37:44.427
- Now, let's just settle down.
- Get your hands off me.

37:44.507 --> 37:49.148
If you think you can do me like you did
Sister Leslie, you're dead wrong, fella.

37:49.228 --> 37:52.735
Now, what's all the commotion, granny?
Why don't we just quiet down a bit?

37:52.815 --> 37:54.650
Arrest me, will ya?

37:54.730 --> 37:57.206
I'm not the one you should be talking to.

37:57.286 --> 38:00.086
Am I, Mr. Bruce Wayne?

38:00.406 --> 38:04.497
Find me at Skinner's End, everybody knows me!

38:04.577 --> 38:07.715
You'll pay up if you know
what's good for you.

38:07.795 --> 38:11.516
Or mark me... you'll hang!

38:47.658 --> 38:49.542
Here you are.

38:49.622 --> 38:51.125
How punctual.

38:51.205 --> 38:53.607
Even a bit early, Batman.

38:54.877 --> 38:57.982
You should feel at home here
with my collection.

38:58.062 --> 39:01.890
Usually, it's on our own face,
that is the mask.

39:01.970 --> 39:05.440
These masks, the ones you choose to wear...

39:05.520 --> 39:07.955
...they show the true self.

39:09.592 --> 39:12.794
Of course, you understand
why I couldn't say more.

39:20.335 --> 39:24.343
Now, we both know
you cannot do your work on me.

39:24.423 --> 39:26.295
I'm not a street walker.

39:26.375 --> 39:29.197
It's antithetical to your neurosis.

39:29.777 --> 39:32.384
I'd stake my professional reputation on it.

39:33.114 --> 39:35.019
You can't!

39:53.301 --> 39:55.398
Help me!

39:55.478 --> 39:58.456
Stop. Please.

39:58.536 --> 40:01.307
No, my God, no!

41:37.706 --> 41:40.712
Arkham to police headquarters.
The Batman has murdered Dr. Strange...

41:40.792 --> 41:43.961
...and escaped in the police airship.
He's heading right for you.

42:30.726 --> 42:32.411
This way, fellas.

43:57.478 --> 43:58.996
Fire!

44:46.627 --> 44:48.278
No.

44:49.731 --> 44:51.816
There he is!

45:24.602 --> 45:28.274
- Keep firing, boys. Shoot to kill.
- Belay that order!

45:29.304 --> 45:30.910
Nice of you to join us, Commissioner.

45:31.040 --> 45:34.462
Do you mind telling me exactly why we
shouldn't shoot the murdering lunatic...

45:34.542 --> 45:38.083
- ...who's gutting whores all over town?
- Watch your tone, Chief.

45:38.163 --> 45:41.743
We have witnesses who saw the Batman
at the time of the Isley murder.

45:41.823 --> 45:44.343
And what about the two men
he just killed at Arkham?

45:44.423 --> 45:46.641
We don't know what happened
for certain, Bulldog.

45:46.721 --> 45:49.967
There'll be no lynch mob
on my watch, do you understand?

45:50.047 --> 45:54.081
We catch him and if he's guilty,
he hangs, but I want him alive.

45:54.161 --> 45:56.815
Now fan out. Find him!

46:19.004 --> 46:22.823
Pick up everyone.
He could be anyone on the street.

46:42.444 --> 46:44.262
Get in.

46:50.853 --> 46:53.859
As you surmised, I get tired of Crest Hill.

46:53.939 --> 46:56.988
I amuse myself by slumming with the unwashed.

46:57.068 --> 47:00.611
Do your downtown escapades
usually end with excessive bleeding?

47:04.132 --> 47:08.153
The belt and gloves must go immediately.
Any of the bat accoutrement.

47:08.953 --> 47:11.296
They'll have the entire area cordoned off.

47:11.376 --> 47:13.477
Homes, carriages searched.

47:13.557 --> 47:17.132
It wouldn't do to have them
find your stage wear.

47:17.212 --> 47:19.697
Hold! Hold, I say!

47:20.838 --> 47:24.051
Open up, open up in the name of the law.

47:27.489 --> 47:29.568
Is there a problem, Officer?

47:31.041 --> 47:34.499
No, Mr. Wayne. We've just been...

47:34.579 --> 47:37.782
You should head home. Dangerous
characters on the streets tonight.

47:38.199 --> 47:40.852
Duly noted. Anything else, gentlemen?

47:41.959 --> 47:44.326
No. Excuse me, sir.

47:44.406 --> 47:47.859
And madam. Have a wonderful night.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.008
Lucky bugger.

47:54.088 --> 47:55.804
You were very convincing.

47:55.884 --> 47:58.843
I'm an actress, darling. Didn't you know?

47:58.923 --> 48:00.658
I'm the toast of Gotham.

48:00.738 --> 48:04.079
You, on the other hand,
would never make it out of the chorus.

48:04.159 --> 48:07.449
You must commit completely to the role.

48:07.529 --> 48:10.184
And how exactly do I do that, Ms. Kyle?

48:10.264 --> 48:13.537
Repetition. You must practice.

48:13.617 --> 48:16.669
Practice, practice.

48:24.311 --> 48:27.459
I want another squad moving
into Cape Carmine. And then...

48:27.539 --> 48:30.881
Commissioner! We found something, sir.

48:40.861 --> 48:42.479
The boys just found her.

48:47.485 --> 48:49.337
Show me.

48:59.047 --> 49:02.905
Well, I guess it's true what they say.

49:02.985 --> 49:05.402
Practice makes perf...

49:13.644 --> 49:16.958
I had these brought up.
I have a rather large wardrobe.

49:17.038 --> 49:20.018
The entire production is mine, you know?

49:20.701 --> 49:23.120
I'm not just another pretty face.

49:24.639 --> 49:28.345
I feel a perfect fool for not
realizing your secret earlier.

49:28.425 --> 49:32.166
When you first kissed my hand backstage,
I felt the callous on your palm...

49:32.246 --> 49:36.687
...and thought, "This man's got
the hands of a trapeze artist."

49:36.767 --> 49:40.492
I saw the circus in the acrobatic
dismount you used in your show.

49:40.572 --> 49:43.528
And then of course,
your fighting style and the whip.

49:43.608 --> 49:45.842
Expert lion tamer.

49:48.596 --> 49:50.632
I grew up with those cats.

49:51.082 --> 49:53.588
Looked after them, loved them.

49:53.668 --> 49:55.657
Papa hated them.

49:55.737 --> 49:58.559
He wasn't a kind man to them or to me.

49:58.639 --> 50:00.795
He was always threatening to shoot them.

50:00.875 --> 50:02.510
And I believed him.

50:02.590 --> 50:07.402
One day he tried to but someone
had taken the bullets out of his gun.

50:08.532 --> 50:12.006
And now, you look after all
those strays in Skinner's End.

50:12.086 --> 50:16.411
Someone has to. They don't have
anyone else to protect them.

50:16.491 --> 50:18.062
Until now.

50:18.142 --> 50:20.748
Until the Batman.

50:20.828 --> 50:23.047
Does he have a story?

50:24.166 --> 50:25.486
Selina...

50:25.566 --> 50:27.984
Oh, your parents.

50:29.603 --> 50:32.677
Are you making them pay? The criminals?

50:33.007 --> 50:36.649
I was but... it'd never be enough.

50:37.129 --> 50:40.331
They couldn't ever pay enough. Could they?

50:54.095 --> 50:55.867
They're here.

50:55.947 --> 50:58.366
Police! Put your hands in the air.

51:01.402 --> 51:03.105
What's the meaning of this?

51:03.185 --> 51:05.289
Oh, a thousand pardons, Ms. Kyle.

51:05.639 --> 51:09.330
For disturbing the sanctity
of a lady's bedchamber.

51:09.410 --> 51:10.945
What do you want, Bullock?

51:11.025 --> 51:15.370
Bruce Wayne, you're under arrest
for the murder of one Marlene Mahoney.

51:15.750 --> 51:18.077
- Who?
- Oh, is that how it is now?

51:18.157 --> 51:21.188
You've killed so many,
you don't even know their names.

51:22.329 --> 51:25.013
Think hard, Wayne. Maybe you'll remember.

51:25.093 --> 51:27.469
You'll have a long time to think about it.

51:27.549 --> 51:31.385
Bruce, it'll be all right.
I'll contact Harvey. He'll clear this all up.

51:31.465 --> 51:35.674
I wouldn't be countin' on Mr. Dent
being too helpful, lassie.

51:36.438 --> 51:40.458
He's the one who suggested
we look for Mr. Wayne in your hotel.

51:49.334 --> 51:51.903
Commissioner, James, this is absurd.

51:51.983 --> 51:55.073
You can't imagine I'm actually the ripper.

51:56.657 --> 51:58.975
Get him out of my sight.

52:13.590 --> 52:16.442
The county of Gotham has abundant
evidence linking the accused...

52:16.522 --> 52:19.230
...to at least three
of these vicious murders.

52:19.310 --> 52:20.722
Physical evidence...

52:20.802 --> 52:24.589
...a lapel pin of the Dionysus Club
to which Mr. Wayne is a member...

52:24.669 --> 52:29.394
...was discovered at the site of Sister
Leslie's murder. Also, an eye witness...

52:29.474 --> 52:32.751
...who was overheard placing
Mr. Wayne at the scene of the crime.

52:32.831 --> 52:37.202
That witness, Marlene Mahony,
was subsequently discovered...

52:37.282 --> 52:40.507
...mutilated in the same barbaric
manner as the other victims...

52:40.587 --> 52:44.876
...after reportedly attempting
to extort cash from the accused.

52:44.956 --> 52:47.462
Furthermore, the prisoner
was also acquainted...

52:47.542 --> 52:50.228
...with reaper victim, Ms. Pamela Isley.

52:51.278 --> 52:53.701
One wonders how many other
lovely young wards...

52:53.781 --> 52:57.772
Enough! Enough!
You've made your point, Mr. Prosecutor.

52:57.852 --> 53:01.476
The accused will be remanded to
the custody of Blackgate Penitentiary...

53:01.556 --> 53:04.863
...until such time as a trial by jury
can be arranged by the county.

53:04.943 --> 53:09.349
If it please the court, as the nature
of these crimes is so detestable...

53:09.429 --> 53:13.120
...and Mr. Wayne has ample financial
resources to escape justice...

53:13.200 --> 53:15.947
...I request the court to not set bail.

53:16.027 --> 53:20.374
Granted. Bailiff will remove
the prisoner to Blackgate Prison.

53:20.457 --> 53:22.325
Court adjourned.

53:31.668 --> 53:35.309
Hey, Jack,
you're not the only one who can cut.

53:35.389 --> 53:37.845
Let's see if Wayne blood really is blue.

53:38.794 --> 53:40.558
Tell him.

53:46.401 --> 53:51.209
Blackgate's real progressive.
Warden likes to encourage physical exercise.

53:51.289 --> 53:53.106
You'll see.

53:53.841 --> 53:58.502
The deluxe suite. Please, enjoy
your stay at the Hotel Blackgate.

53:59.690 --> 54:02.750
Yeah, we're looking forward
to seeing you checkout.

54:12.093 --> 54:14.381
I love what you've done with the place.

54:14.461 --> 54:17.685
Selina, what are you doing here?
This is no place for a lady.

54:17.765 --> 54:20.337
You should see some
of the houses I've played to.

54:20.417 --> 54:23.636
They make this seem
like a command performance.

54:24.238 --> 54:27.344
- You need to get out of here.
- No, you need to get out of here.

54:27.424 --> 54:29.857
When my friend has gone
to all the trouble of building...

54:29.937 --> 54:32.707
...this well-constructed gilded frame for me?

54:32.787 --> 54:36.528
Your friend? You think one
of your friends is framing you?

54:36.608 --> 54:39.873
One of my mentors says that
when you eliminate the impossible...

54:39.953 --> 54:43.954
...whatever remains,
however improbable, must be the truth.

54:44.034 --> 54:48.211
That's a lot of eyewash.
You must liberate yourself immediately.

54:48.291 --> 54:50.752
Unfortunately, my nocturnal
habits preclude me...

54:50.882 --> 54:53.641
...from providing an adequate
account of my whereabouts.

54:53.721 --> 54:57.715
Well, you'll just have to explain
to Gordon that you are the Batman.

54:57.795 --> 54:59.724
What? I think not.

54:59.804 --> 55:04.147
You must. Batman has an ironclad
alibi for the first murder.

55:04.227 --> 55:09.303
You'll be released. Gotham needs the Batman
to help rid the streets of this killer.

55:09.383 --> 55:13.150
I'm sorry, Selina. I can't.
The Batman's effectiveness depends upon...

55:13.230 --> 55:15.877
Every moment you're in here
puts women in danger.

55:15.957 --> 55:20.247
If you won't tell Gordon,
then I will. Immediately.

55:20.327 --> 55:22.250
He'll never believe you.

55:22.330 --> 55:24.381
He'll believe this.

55:26.768 --> 55:29.172
I'll be damned if I'll let
another girl be murdered...

55:29.252 --> 55:32.126
...so you can keep your precious secret.

55:32.206 --> 55:36.828
I'm sorry, Bruce, but I think ultimately
you'll find this was all for the best.

55:47.120 --> 55:49.206
Chow time, your highness.

55:52.744 --> 55:55.832
Listen to me, bring this to
my townhouse on Bell Avenue...

55:55.912 --> 56:00.151
- ...and my man there will give you $100.
- If you think I can be bought...

56:00.231 --> 56:03.586
Get it there within 30 minutes,
he'll give you $200.

56:15.482 --> 56:17.468
Yes! Yes!

56:17.548 --> 56:19.986
- Give it to him!
- Come on!

56:24.458 --> 56:26.264
Lay him out!

56:27.244 --> 56:30.077
Come on, put up a fight for Christ's sake!

56:33.634 --> 56:36.106
Who is next?

56:36.186 --> 56:39.292
Who will face Cyrus Gold?

56:39.372 --> 56:41.222
I'll give it a whirl.

56:43.894 --> 56:47.868
No weaklings. Can't get good
enough odds against you.

56:47.948 --> 56:51.472
I'll beat you in private, later.

56:51.552 --> 56:53.386
No time like the present.

57:33.526 --> 57:36.471
While you're sittin' on your ass,
there's a damn donnybrook in there!

57:36.551 --> 57:39.900
Shore up the west gate!
Fetch the riot gear from the arsenal!

57:57.517 --> 57:58.522
May I help you, miss?

57:58.602 --> 58:01.057
Yes, I need to see
Commissioner Gordon immediately.

58:01.137 --> 58:04.361
- I'm afraid, that's impossible.
- I must insist, it's quite urgent.

58:04.441 --> 58:07.147
You never slow down, do you?

58:07.227 --> 58:11.588
As soon as one lover boy is unavailable,
you're on to the next chump.

58:11.998 --> 58:15.435
I can imagine what I ever saw
in a whore like you.

58:17.405 --> 58:19.826
Better sheath those claws, kitten.

58:19.906 --> 58:21.728
Someone is liable to get hurt.

58:21.808 --> 58:25.411
And sooner or later, you will.

58:29.417 --> 58:30.722
James isn't here.

58:30.802 --> 58:34.157
He's down at the fairgrounds,
making sure everything's shipshape.

58:34.237 --> 58:38.408
Tomorrow is the big day. You'll have
to scratch up some business elsewhere.

58:39.893 --> 58:41.946
The fairground, hurry.

58:59.332 --> 59:01.168
This is it.

59:01.248 --> 59:04.671
You're off your nut.
We're in the middle of nothin'.

59:05.001 --> 59:07.403
This is where that geezer told us to go.

59:07.838 --> 59:09.906
I can read, can't I?

59:10.741 --> 59:12.849
So you keep tellin' us.

59:12.929 --> 59:15.762
Come on, he said to unload it here.

59:18.014 --> 59:22.223
I still say we take the wagon, the horse,
and whatever this is and skedaddle.

59:22.303 --> 59:24.521
Serve him right for being so trusting.

59:24.601 --> 59:26.234
But he fed us.

59:26.314 --> 59:30.361
We're gonna do the job, Jason.
Now shut your boom box and push.

59:40.204 --> 59:42.636
Good job. Now, go.

01:00:25.616 --> 01:00:27.418
What are you doing here?

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.506
You're Ms. Kyle, the actress, aren't you?

01:00:32.586 --> 01:00:35.428
Yes, Commissioner,
we met before, at the preview.

01:00:35.508 --> 01:00:37.364
I thought I was all alone.

01:00:37.444 --> 01:00:41.297
Embarrassing as it sounds,
you gave me quite a start.

01:00:45.933 --> 01:00:48.739
Commissioner? Selina?

01:01:09.876 --> 01:01:12.807
- Mrs. Gordon, don't be alarmed.
- What do you want?

01:01:12.887 --> 01:01:15.223
I need to talk to your husband. Is he home?

01:01:15.303 --> 01:01:18.605
You mustn't harm him. He's a good man.

01:01:18.685 --> 01:01:21.174
The best man in this horrible city.

01:01:21.254 --> 01:01:23.394
Did a woman come here looking for him?

01:01:23.474 --> 01:01:26.797
A woman? Walking here off the streets?

01:01:26.877 --> 01:01:28.762
I should hope not.

01:01:32.165 --> 01:01:34.484
No! You're not allowed in there!

01:02:24.718 --> 01:02:26.586
Where is he?

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.793
Doing what he needs to do.

01:02:29.873 --> 01:02:31.595
His holy work.

01:02:31.675 --> 01:02:33.781
Cleaning the scum from Gotham.

01:02:33.861 --> 01:02:35.683
He needs to be severe.

01:02:36.497 --> 01:02:39.452
But not with us. No.

01:02:39.532 --> 01:02:42.418
No, he's gentle as a lamb with us.

01:02:43.203 --> 01:02:47.077
He simply burns the sin out of us.

01:02:47.157 --> 01:02:48.806
We need him to.

01:02:49.442 --> 01:02:51.210
Good Lord.

01:02:52.245 --> 01:02:55.301
It's the woman's sins that are the worst.

01:02:55.381 --> 01:02:57.921
Because they're hidden inside.

01:02:58.001 --> 01:03:01.587
James brings them out into the light.

01:03:02.522 --> 01:03:04.974
Where is he?

01:03:06.627 --> 01:03:09.630
I suspected, of course.
Who else, but Bruce Wayne...

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:13.054
...has either the time
or resources to create the Batman.

01:03:13.134 --> 01:03:16.508
We'll see to this immediately.
Let me fetch my things.

01:03:17.038 --> 01:03:19.647
I suppose it's a dreadful
betrayal of confidence.

01:03:19.727 --> 01:03:22.129
But I simply see no other way.

01:03:22.209 --> 01:03:24.698
No, no, Ms. Kyle, I understand completely.

01:03:24.778 --> 01:03:28.465
It's in your very nature to play false
with your illicit lover.

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:32.605
An action ideal to expose...

01:03:32.685 --> 01:03:35.939
...your absolute internal corruption.

01:03:56.426 --> 01:04:00.507
A 7% solution of laudanum,
3% heroin and alcohol.

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:03.705
Barbara's physician
prescribes it for acute insomnia.

01:04:04.635 --> 01:04:06.687
Effective, is it not?

01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:11.111
But it's hardly a cure for harlotry.

01:04:11.521 --> 01:04:15.713
Only, I. Only Jack
has the remedy for that vile ill.

01:04:18.498 --> 01:04:21.918
Damnation! You'll pay for that, slut!

01:05:09.382 --> 01:05:12.472
You can't get far.
The oversweet fragrance you used...

01:05:12.552 --> 01:05:16.606
...to cover your putrefying
stench nearly burns my eyes.

01:05:21.811 --> 01:05:23.844
Come to Jack, you little...

01:05:49.423 --> 01:05:51.240
Nice try.

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.632
Wayne promised this World's Fair...

01:05:54.712 --> 01:05:57.837
...would be a paradise
of cleanliness and light.

01:05:57.917 --> 01:06:00.534
But what does a light in the darkness do?

01:06:00.834 --> 01:06:02.522
It draws flies.

01:06:02.602 --> 01:06:06.437
Vile, unclean, like you.

01:06:09.475 --> 01:06:14.235
But for every one of you
I eradicate, two more arrive.

01:06:14.315 --> 01:06:18.722
I promised the people of Gotham
to clean scum of the streets...

01:06:18.802 --> 01:06:22.226
...thieves, murderers, confidence men...

01:06:22.306 --> 01:06:25.678
...immigrants, illiterates, anarchists.

01:06:25.758 --> 01:06:28.411
This city seems to spawn them.

01:06:31.098 --> 01:06:35.405
But it's whores... you painted
whores that are the worst.

01:06:35.485 --> 01:06:39.923
All rosy-cheeked,
soft and round on the outside...

01:06:40.003 --> 01:06:42.009
...but on the inside...

01:06:44.778 --> 01:06:48.016
My death prove...

01:06:48.696 --> 01:06:49.939
...innocent.

01:06:50.019 --> 01:06:53.640
Yes. Sadly, your death will exonerate Wayne.

01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:55.943
But it will be worth it.

01:06:56.023 --> 01:06:59.213
Your blood shall christen this fair, woman.

01:06:59.293 --> 01:07:03.005
Your corruption and decay
will spill down over this carnival...

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:05.698
...as a warning to all your kind.

01:07:06.767 --> 01:07:08.556
Shall we begin?

01:07:08.936 --> 01:07:12.539
This may take quite some time.

01:07:26.953 --> 01:07:28.728
Left handed.

01:07:28.808 --> 01:07:31.444
Oh, the nuns beat that wickedness out of me.

01:07:31.524 --> 01:07:33.580
Always use my right.

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.428
Except for Jack's work.

01:08:00.124 --> 01:08:02.622
Can you speak? Have you any other injuries?

01:08:02.702 --> 01:08:05.408
No. I'm... Bruce!

01:08:21.108 --> 01:08:23.662
You were right. I'm a trained fighter.

01:08:23.743 --> 01:08:26.032
Bare knuckle champion at Culpepper.

01:08:26.112 --> 01:08:28.532
London Prize Ring rules.

01:08:28.612 --> 01:08:31.792
There were no rules at Antietam,
though, were there, James?

01:08:31.872 --> 01:08:34.371
There are no rules in hell.

01:08:41.127 --> 01:08:43.790
The things I saw during the war...

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:48.020
...the entirety of humanity's
evil was there for all to see...

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.736
...on the inside of every man.

01:08:54.874 --> 01:08:59.359
But nothing compared to the corruption
of every painted camp follower.

01:08:59.895 --> 01:09:03.537
The vile diseases they spread,
destroy good men...

01:09:03.617 --> 01:09:06.801
...destroyed them in both body and mind.

01:10:22.378 --> 01:10:26.100
I saw your work on your wife.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.055
Wives? They are the worst prostitutes of all.

01:10:29.135 --> 01:10:31.508
Sell themselves too cheap.

01:10:31.588 --> 01:10:35.658
Wives, brothers, that slut nun of yours.

01:10:51.358 --> 01:10:54.851
Look, Bruce, the world
of tomorrow is burning.

01:10:54.931 --> 01:10:58.425
Exposing the ashes
of degradation hiding beneath.

01:10:58.505 --> 01:11:01.151
This is where we belong!

01:11:02.285 --> 01:11:03.553
No.

01:11:09.185 --> 01:11:12.546
I paid Houdini $300 for that trick.

01:11:15.381 --> 01:11:18.234
Fight's over. Time to go.

01:11:36.069 --> 01:11:37.587
Gordon!

01:12:42.384 --> 01:12:44.540
You should have run when you had that chance.

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:49.259
Well, I was badly doped up.
My actions were quite questionable.

01:12:53.179 --> 01:12:55.542
Help them in, lads. Lively now.

01:12:55.622 --> 01:13:00.094
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
And there you'll always be, sir.

01:13:13.066 --> 01:13:15.067
Do these belong to you, Alfred?

01:13:15.617 --> 01:13:18.855
Good Lord. No, sir. They belong to you.

01:13:35.405 --> 01:13:37.810
Gone. All gone.

01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:40.312
And the hope of Gotham with it.

01:13:40.392 --> 01:13:42.052
It was all phony anyway.

01:13:42.132 --> 01:13:44.214
We'll make something new.

01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:46.799
Something better.
