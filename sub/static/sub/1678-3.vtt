00:13.000 --> 00:15.800
So there was this one night before I met your mother,

00:15.840 --> 00:17.760
when I really wanted to go to the bar.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.320
The bar... big surprise.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.120
You sure spent a lot of time in bars.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.280
Well, that's just we did back then.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.640
Me, Marshall and Lily,

00:26.720 --> 00:28.400
Barney, Robin--

00:28.480 --> 00:31.480
we all used to hang out at this one bar called McClaren's.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.480
But then, one night...

00:33.560 --> 00:34.640
Why don't we go to McClaren's?

00:34.680 --> 00:35.840
Let's go to McClaren's.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.360
You guys talking to each other?

00:38.440 --> 00:39.760
Nobody's listening?

00:39.920 --> 00:41.120
What's wrong with McClaren's?

00:41.240 --> 00:43.080
McClaren's is bore-snore.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.880
Ted, tonight we're going to go out.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.360
We're going to meet some ladies.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.440
It's going to be legendary.

00:48.520 --> 00:49.360
Phone five.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.440
I had no idea why I hung out with Barney.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.480
You didn't phone five, did you?

00:55.920 --> 00:57.840
I know when you don't phone five, Ted.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.280
Come on.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.240
We always to go to McClaren's.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.200
Yeah, 'cause McClaren's is fun.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.440
McClaren's is this much fun.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.560
What I'm offering is the chance to have...

01:07.760 --> 01:09.480
this much fun.

01:09.560 --> 01:10.400
See, you say that.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.160
You say it's going to be this much fun,

01:12.200 --> 01:14.680
but most of the time it ends up being this much fun.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.200
This much fun is good.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.920
It's safe. It's guaranteed.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.280
This hand gesture thing doesn't really work on the phone, does it?

01:20.360 --> 01:21.280
No, it doesn't.

01:22.320 --> 01:23.280
Get in the cab.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.480
Marshall, you, too.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.600
Oh, I wish I could. I think Lily and I are just going to...

01:26.640 --> 01:28.160
I understand. Ted, get in the cab.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.320
Why can Marshall say no?

01:29.400 --> 01:31.360
Uh, because he's getting laid.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.040
Consistently.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.440
Ted, Ted, Ted... right here.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.680
You keep going to the same bar. You're in a rut.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.160
And I am a rut-buster.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.000
I'm going to bust your rut.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.400
It's not a rut, okay?

01:43.480 --> 01:45.400
It's a routine, and I like it.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.880
Ted, what's the first syllable in "rut-tine"?

01:56.920 --> 01:58.000
Peace out, suckers.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.560
All right, so what's this legendary plan?

02:02.600 --> 02:04.240
First we've got to pick someone up at the airport.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.360
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Estaban, doors.

02:10.639 --> 02:14.040
Okay, we just do this one little thing, and the rest of the night is ours.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.520
Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up?

02:16.600 --> 02:17.280
I don't know.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.240
Maybe her.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.360
Or her.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.760
Wait, so when you said you were going to pick someone up at the airport,

02:23.840 --> 02:27.720
you meant you were going to "pick someone up" at the airport?

02:28.120 --> 02:32.400
Scenario: a couple of girls fly into town looking for a fun weekend in NYC,

02:32.440 --> 02:35.360
when the meet two handsome international businessmen

02:35.440 --> 02:38.000
just back from a lucrative trip to Japan.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.840
Sample dialogue:

02:39.880 --> 02:43.040
"You have a wheelie bag? Well, I have a wheelie bag."

02:43.080 --> 02:44.120
You've got to be kidding me.

02:44.200 --> 02:44.960
False.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.520
Sidebar... tuck in your shirt. You look sketchy.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.040
I'm sketchy?

02:49.080 --> 02:51.080
Trust me, it's going to be legendary.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.560
Don't say "legendary," okay?

02:52.680 --> 02:55.120
You're too liberal with the word "legendary."

02:55.360 --> 02:57.000
We're building an igloo in Central Park.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.920
It's going to be legendary. Snowsuit up!

03:01.560 --> 03:03.920
Ted, Ted, Ted... right here.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.840
This is happening. Now you can either put the bags on the carousel now,

03:06.880 --> 03:09.160
or you can listen to me give you a really long speech convincing you

03:09.200 --> 03:11.280
to put the bags on the carousel. Your move.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.920
Ted, since the dawn of time-- mankind has struggled...

03:19.040 --> 03:21.440
That night, Marshall had  a ton of studying to do.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.800
So Lily went out  with Robin--

03:22.880 --> 03:25.080
who was new to New York and looking for a friend.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.240
I'm so glad we finally get to hang out, just the two of us.

03:28.280 --> 03:28.880
Yeah.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.160
You sure you're okay giving up your Friday night to hang with an old, almost married lady?

03:33.200 --> 03:35.520
Oh, please. I'm so sick of the meat market scene.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.000
Guys are like the subway.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.400
You miss one, another one comes along in five minutes.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.440
Unless it's the end of the night and then you get on anything.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.360
Hey-oh!

03:44.840 --> 03:46.560
Compliments of that guy.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.200
Really?

03:49.360 --> 03:50.440
Sweet.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.360
Oh, for you it's $6.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.320
Oh, yes, that's one drawback to being engaged.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.800
I'm sure that's why he didn't...

03:57.880 --> 03:58.560
Hey.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.600
Oh, hello.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.880
So, uh... did you just get in from Detroit?

04:10.320 --> 04:11.320
Japan.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.360
Okay, carousel 4 is tapped out.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.320
Ready? Because I'm about to drop some knowledge.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.720
Cute girls are not from Buffalo.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.160
Time-out, 10:00.

04:26.480 --> 04:27.680
You ready to rock this, Tedder?

04:27.760 --> 04:30.320
All right, I think we need to refine our back story first. How did we...?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.760
Ted, you klutzy great guy you.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.200
- Hey, I'm Barney.
- Hi.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.400
- My God, are you okay?
- I am so sorry.

04:39.440 --> 04:43.240
It's fine. No, you were shaky on your landing. I give you a 9.2.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.120
Ooh. Hi. I'm Ted.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.080
I'm Laura.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.960
Look, I'm really sorry that we have to hit and run, but we've got a plane to catch.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.760
- Where you headed?
- Philadelphia.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.800
Philly? That's where we're headed.

04:52.840 --> 04:53.800
You are?

04:54.480 --> 04:56.400
Well, then we'll see you on the plane.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.560
Yes, you will.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.120
Follow them. Ticket's on me.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.400
No. Barney!

05:02.440 --> 05:04.160
Don't you get on that escalator!

05:05.040 --> 05:07.880
And don't you dare get on that subsequent escalator!

05:12.440 --> 05:14.800
Studying law.

05:16.880 --> 05:21.560
Making a responsible choice for my future.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.840
On Friday night.

05:26.600 --> 05:30.880
Being a lawyer had better be awesome.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.080
Whazzup, Ted?

05:36.880 --> 05:37.800
Are you all right?

05:38.040 --> 05:38.720
Yeah.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.880
Hey, guess where I am. I'm on a... ready?

05:40.920 --> 05:43.000
Plane to... ready? Philadelphia.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.640
That is awesome.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.560
Hey, is that Marshall?

05:45.760 --> 05:48.400
Marshall, stop whatever you're doing, get in that hoopty-ass Fiero of yours

05:48.440 --> 05:51.040
and come meet us in Philly. It's going to be legendary.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.720
Man, I wish I could, guys...

05:52.800 --> 05:55.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I sent you some pictures on my phone. Check it.

06:01.040 --> 06:01.800
Philly.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.640
Admit it: you're having fun.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.760
This much fu... 35,000 feet of fun.

06:08.760 --> 06:12.040
Well, I didn't think I'd be flying to Philadelphia when I woke up this morning, I'll give you that.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.160
Attaboy. Let's go talk to those girls.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.840
Whoa, whoa, the seat belt sign's on.

06:16.040 --> 06:20.080
Ted, you've been living your whole life in a seat belt.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.760
It's time to unclick.

06:24.240 --> 06:27.560
- Sir, the seat belt light's on.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.480
Well, I grew up in Park Slope.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.080
Oh, I love Park Slope. When did you move to Manhattan?

06:34.120 --> 06:35.360
You're from Park Slope?

06:35.480 --> 06:36.600
Uh, no, she is.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.560
So where are you from?

06:38.640 --> 06:39.560
Heaven?

06:39.880 --> 06:41.560
Yeah, I'm a ghost.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.320
I died 15 years ago, like that pickup line.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.480
Hey-oh!

06:46.560 --> 06:47.520
God, I'm so sorry.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.960
Oh, believe me, I've been there.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.200
I have this line that I use when guys come...

06:51.280 --> 06:52.200
Check it out.

06:52.960 --> 06:53.960
Hey...

06:54.880 --> 06:57.840
You take this one. I'll save it for the next one.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.280
So what brings you guys to Philly?

07:02.320 --> 07:03.560
We're visiting our boyfriends.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.800
I think hers is going to propose this weekend.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.680
Isn't that great?

07:09.200 --> 07:10.520
So great.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.040
So there we were:

07:16.120 --> 07:19.760
stuck on an airplane to Philadelphia with two very un-single girls,

07:19.840 --> 07:21.760
all thanks to your Uncle Barney.

07:21.840 --> 07:22.920
Aren't they cute?

07:23.160 --> 07:25.160
They're both linebackers for the Eagles.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.440
Both?

07:26.760 --> 07:30.040
Both of their boyfriends are linebackers.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.920
You're going to Philly? Why?

07:34.960 --> 07:36.520
I didn't ask.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.280
Well, it's sounds like you're having a lot more fun than I am.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.560
I'm just talking to guy's backs while they hit on Robin.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.640
Yeah, I bet she gets that a lot.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.000
Don't you bet I get that a lot?

07:48.120 --> 07:49.360
Not with a ring on your finger.

07:49.400 --> 07:53.360
I mean, you know, guys see the ring, it's like ka-chong, Marshall parking only.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.000
Oh, of course. That's it, the ring.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.640
I guess I'm not used to it yet.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.160
Oh, it's totally the ring. If you took that ring off your finger,

08:00.240 --> 08:02.440
you'd have a ton of guys crowding your junk.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.480
I'm not gonna take off my ring.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.400
Wouldn't you be jealous of guys swarming all over my beeswax?

08:08.640 --> 08:11.720
Oh, yeah, you know me-- I'm the jealous type.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.720
Any goon so much as looks at you, I'll sock him in the kisser.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.800
No. Seriously, you girls have a good time tonight.

08:17.080 --> 08:17.960
Bye.

08:25.080 --> 08:25.880
Robin!

08:26.160 --> 08:26.880
Robin!

08:27.680 --> 08:28.920
Hey, I'm over here.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.280
G-G-Goin' to Philly!

08:33.320 --> 08:35.000
Marshall, don't come to Philly.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.840
But we're on an adventure.

08:36.919 --> 08:41.000
We're on a tarmac in Philadelphia. Crazy... adventure.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.360
Fine.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.560
No! No!

08:45.640 --> 08:47.080
The night has just started.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.720
Look, airport bar. Flight attendants.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.280
They'll get your tray table in its full upright position.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.720
Say what?!

08:54.000 --> 08:57.240
Passengers Mosby and Stenson, please come with us, gentlemen.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.600
Keep your hands where I can see them.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.880
Barney, I am going to kill you.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.920
Don't say you're gonna kill someone in front of airport security.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.360
Not cool, not cool.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.640
This is an outrage!

09:09.720 --> 09:14.280
We are international businessmen on very important international business trip.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.560
I demand you release us immediately!

09:16.640 --> 09:18.400
You demand?! No, no, no, no, no.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.760
He does not demand. We-We-We-We have no demands.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.840
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to remain calm.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.720
Okay. Yeah, I'm calm. I'm totally calm.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.120
We've got footage of you placing two bags on JFK carousel 3,

09:29.160 --> 09:33.400
and abandoning them to purchase a last-minute flight with cash.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.800
Those bags were your responsibility.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.240
- They were your bags!
- Sir, please.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.800
We're assessing the bag situation.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.120
Look, this is all just... It's a misunderstanding.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.120
Please.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.720
We are international businessmen.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.400
My colleague accidentally left the bags there.

09:53.440 --> 09:57.720
Now, please let us go before we miss our international business meeting.

09:59.360 --> 10:04.000
Can't remember the last time I saw an international businessman with an untucked shirt.

10:04.440 --> 10:08.920
In addition, we received this footage taken over the last few months.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.640
Believe it or not, that duffel bag thing worked.

10:38.320 --> 10:39.960
The truth is, my friend--

10:40.040 --> 10:42.080
he does this thing where he goes to airports with fake luggage

10:42.120 --> 10:44.880
to pick up girls, and we followed some here to Philadelphia.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.320
That-That-That's it. That's all this is.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.840
Nobody's that lame.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.920
Yes, he's that lame.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.520
Tell him you're that lame.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.480
- We are international businessmen.
- Oh, come on!

10:58.520 --> 11:01.600
Sir, lower your voice, or I will restrain you.

11:01.640 --> 11:03.600
Dude, seriously, relax.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.840
We at least get to call our lawyer.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.040
Exactly!

11:07.920 --> 11:09.040
We have a lawyer?

11:10.080 --> 11:12.400
Listen to me-- you're both American citizens.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.600
Dot let him pull any Patriot Act voodoo.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.800
You both retain the right to refuse to answer any questions without an attorney present,

11:17.880 --> 11:19.960
so don't say anything until I get there, all right?

11:20.040 --> 11:21.120
Okay. Good-bye.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.280
Philly!

11:23.560 --> 11:26.400
The adventure continues!

11:26.520 --> 11:28.200
Destroy!

11:31.760 --> 11:34.040
It's ridiculous in here. Why don't we go somewhere else?

11:34.080 --> 11:37.320
No, this place is great.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.960
What are you doing?

11:41.200 --> 11:42.000
What?

11:42.120 --> 11:44.080
With your lips and everything?

11:44.720 --> 11:46.920
My lips are always like this.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.440
You had to play the race card.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.600
Oh, relax, Ted. We didn't do anything wrong.

12:01.680 --> 12:05.960
And, B.T.W., we'd be out of here by now if you had tucked in your shirt.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.960
Go ahead, JFK. What is the baggage status?

12:09.000 --> 12:09.920
They're clean.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.600
It's just a whole bunch of condoms.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.480
And a PowerBar.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.640
You're free to go.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.720
Don't come to Philly.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.280
Man, I'm almost halfway there.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.480
Yeah, we just got released and we're heading back on the next flight.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.640
Uh, meet us at McClaren's. Maybe we can still make last call.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.960
Can't we just, just...

12:27.000 --> 12:28.480
No, we can't just.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.480
We're going home.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.240
We're going to Sasha's.

12:31.720 --> 12:32.600
Who the hell is Sasha?

12:32.720 --> 12:34.120
Sasha.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.000
She's having friends over for drinks at her house.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.760
It's gonna be legen... wait for it--

12:39.840 --> 12:43.320
and I hope you're not lactose-intolerant 'cause the second half of that word is... dary!

12:43.560 --> 12:45.200
- No.
- Legendary.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.960
Legendary. That sounds awesome.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.760
No, Marshall, we're going back.

12:49.000 --> 12:49.840
Fine.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.640
Hold on. I have another call.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.600
- Hello?
- Marshall, we're going to Sasha's.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.680
No, we're not.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.120
- Ted, Ted, Ted.
- Right here.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.240
Yes, we are.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.640
Sorry, buddy-- two against one.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.200
Ooh, look, a booth opened up.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.040
Really?

13:06.200 --> 13:07.720
Yeah, I thought we could finally go talk...

13:07.800 --> 13:09.880
and you're not listening to me, so I'm going to walk away.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.120
Yeah, yeah, booth.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.440
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.680
I'm engaged. You know, I'm sorry.

13:20.720 --> 13:25.280
I took my ring off. It's very, very sweet of you to come over and talk to me, but I just...

13:25.360 --> 13:26.640
Yeah, I'm gay.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.040
I just came over to let you know that you sat on a grape.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.960
Oh, damn it.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.800
So Barney and I hit the town. Philadelphia, PA.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.560
Our first and only stop:

13:43.760 --> 13:44.960
Sasha's party.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.080
So, uh... you're Sasha's friends, uh?

13:52.120 --> 13:53.040
You know it.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.480
You guys, keep the volume down.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.360
You're gonna wake my grandpa.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.560
Who wants hard lemonade?

14:10.600 --> 14:11.320
Philly!

14:11.480 --> 14:12.400
Shh!

14:13.120 --> 14:14.080
Philly.

14:18.680 --> 14:22.520
Back at the bar, girls' night out wasn't going as Robin had hoped.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.920
Lily's phone.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.880
Robin, uh, where's Lily?

14:31.080 --> 14:32.560
She's, uh...

14:33.000 --> 14:34.960
Is she talking to some hot guy?

14:35.280 --> 14:37.920
Oh, you can tell me. It's totally cool. It was my idea.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.840
Hell, I told her she could take the ring off.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.640
Really? Well, I thought it was kind of weird, but if you're cool with it,

14:42.720 --> 14:45.160
yeah, uh, it's off, and she's talking to some guy.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.760
- Do you want me to go over and...
- No, no, don't interrupt.

14:47.800 --> 14:48.760
It's awesome.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.360
So, the ring's really off, huh?

14:53.160 --> 14:54.280
It's awesome.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.920
Well, just tell her I called.

14:58.040 --> 15:02.000
And tell her that she is... awesome.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.960
Really, really awesome.

15:10.680 --> 15:14.880
Our relationship is built on mutual trust.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.560
I can't breathe.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.480
You hear that, Ted?

15:20.560 --> 15:22.680
Dana works security at the Liberty Bell.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.640
I do okay.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.600
Wow, it must be really well cordoned off over there.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.960
Do you ever go behind the rope and touch it?

15:29.080 --> 15:30.320
Only all the time.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.800
You ever, like, stick your head inside it?

15:33.200 --> 15:33.960
Yeah.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.160
You ever lick it?

15:37.000 --> 15:37.800
Nope.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.320
I have never licked it.

15:41.320 --> 15:45.640
I bet nobody in history has ever licked the Liberty Bell.

15:45.840 --> 15:49.720
If someone were to pull that off, I dare say it would be...

15:49.760 --> 15:51.160
what's the word?

15:51.520 --> 15:53.040
Well, this is my stop.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.960
Legendary. Ted, legendary.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.280
Barney, I'm going to the airport. Sasha, thank you,

15:57.360 --> 16:00.720
and, uh, tell your grandpa I'm sorry I walked in on him in the bathroom.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.840
I'll get some club soda for that stain.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.080
Lily, I thought tonight was about us hanging out.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.120
What are you doing?

16:11.320 --> 16:14.960
Just fending off the advances of that totally hot guy.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.360
- Dude, I think that guy is gay.
- Oh, I know that guy is gay.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.320
It's just, Marshall and I have been together for nine years.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.640
I haven't been single since high school.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.120
You want to be single?

16:25.360 --> 16:27.120
You want to fight off loser guys all night?

16:27.200 --> 16:28.440
Does that seem like fun to you?

16:28.520 --> 16:31.400
I guess I just wanted to throw this net back into the ocean

16:31.480 --> 16:34.240
and see how many fish I could catch.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.120
So far, one. One gay dolphin.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.800
And Marshall.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.880
Lily, all these girls here tonight are all hoping to catch what you've already got.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.120
You're right. I know.

16:46.040 --> 16:49.720
Hey, do you want to go get coffee and have an actual conversation?

16:49.800 --> 16:53.280
If by "coffee" you mean "cheesecake," then yes.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.440
Hey, I got that club soda.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.560
Let's see that booty.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.520
Oh, thank you so much.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.920
You want to mess, pal?

17:03.920 --> 17:06.440
That's my fiancée's hot backside that you're dabbing.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.920
Marshall, no.

17:08.040 --> 17:11.920
Baby, please, don't ever take that ring off again, no matter how awesome I say that it is.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.800
- It's okay, man...
- Back off, hombre!

17:13.880 --> 17:15.599
I'm not that afraid to fight you.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.480
You want to test this guy, be my guest, come on.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.119
Marshall, he's gay.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.520
Oh, thank God. I've never been in a fight before.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.480
You don't say.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.160
So, it turned out Uncle Marshall really was the jealous type.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.520
Unfortunately, that guy's boyfriend--

17:30.640 --> 17:32.200
also the jealous type.

17:33.800 --> 17:34.640
Hey!

17:42.200 --> 17:44.840
Could have licked the Liberty Bell.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.120
We're going to the airport.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.680
Bong...

17:50.920 --> 17:52.000
bong...

17:53.280 --> 17:55.800
Why do I hang out with you? Why?

17:55.880 --> 17:58.720
All I wanted was to have a regular beer at my regular bar

17:58.800 --> 18:01.480
with my regular friends in my regular city.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.080
Ted, Ted, Ted.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.200
You're not even looking.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.480
No, I'm not.

18:06.840 --> 18:11.120
Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay?

18:11.160 --> 18:14.000
Not for the sit around and wait of happiness.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.520
Now, if you want, you can go to the same bar, drink the same beer,

18:17.560 --> 18:22.240
talk to the same people every day, or you can lick the Liberty Bell.

18:22.320 --> 18:27.320
You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.280
That was beautiful, man.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.440
Thanks, Leonard.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.760
Ted, you're missing out on a valuable life lesson here.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.760
Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay?

18:37.840 --> 18:39.320
I know how to live.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.280
If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell, just go lick it yourself.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.800
No, it has to be the two of us.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.480
Why? Why do you need me?

18:45.480 --> 18:47.720
Because you're my best friend, all right?

18:48.440 --> 18:50.520
You don't have to tell me I'm yours,

18:50.760 --> 18:52.920
but the way I see it, we're a team.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.560
Without you, I'm...

18:55.560 --> 18:57.560
I'm just the Dynamic Uno.

18:58.720 --> 19:03.920
So, fine, if you wanto go home, then we'll go home.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.400
Fine.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.160
We'll go lick the Liberty Bell.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.600
Good 'cause we're here.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.120
I had no idea how Barney redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out,

19:18.160 --> 19:22.120
Dana let us in, and by God, we licked the Liberty Bell.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.680
You know what it tastes like?

19:23.720 --> 19:24.600
What?

19:26.280 --> 19:27.120
Freedom.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.000
No, actually, it tastes like pennies.

19:30.760 --> 19:31.680
Oh, my God.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.400
Did you guys really do that?

19:33.640 --> 19:34.880
We really did.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.960
And that was when I realized why I hung out with Barney.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.120
I never got where I thought I wanted to go,

19:40.160 --> 19:42.040
but I always got a great story.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.640
So, that girl you were talking to-- that was Mom?

19:48.680 --> 19:52.400
Kids, every story in a man's life is like a dot in an Impressionist painting...

19:52.480 --> 19:53.640
So that's a no?

19:53.880 --> 19:55.360
Yeah, that's a no.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.120
What? Come on!
