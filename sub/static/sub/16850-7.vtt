(male narrator)
Previously
on Childrens Hospital.

00:03.171 --> 00:04.405
I'm the only doctor
in this hospital

00:04.471 --> 00:06.274
who's qualified
to do this procedure.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.077
And today that puts me
in a real disadvantage.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.115
- I cured cancer, you dick.
- Huh?

00:14.182 --> 00:16.417
Mom, I did it.
I cured cancer.

00:16.484 --> 00:20.621
Great, now maybe,
you can visit me some time.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.556
Mom, I'm right here.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.059
(male #1)
'Just a little friendly
reminder, Doctor Richie.'

00:25.126 --> 00:27.895
'Stop trying to cure cancer.'

00:27.961 --> 00:31.099
God, I just wish you'd become
a doctor like your brother.

00:31.165 --> 00:34.202
I am a doctor.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.737
[upbeat music]

00:39.107 --> 00:42.510
(female narrator)
We all have a job to do.
Some people take calls.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.778
Some people teach.
Some even go to the moon.

00:44.845 --> 00:48.116
None are more important than
the other.Except for doctors.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.783
You'll notice
that most young patients

00:49.850 --> 00:53.487
respond to almost any situation
with one of two phrases.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.524
"Hot dog" or "Mama Mia".
Watch this.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.793
Hey, I got news for you,
you're going home tomorrow.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.729
Hot dog!

01:01.795 --> 01:04.565
We don't know what's wrong
with you. You're gonna die.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.033
Mama Mia.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.868
I got a ten year old down.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.737
[screaming]

01:09.803 --> 01:11.405
What do we got?

01:11.472 --> 01:13.274
Kid works at knife factory
after school.

01:13.341 --> 01:14.975
- Boss says he's all thumbs.
- Hey, Owen.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.611
Turns out that Blake here
never went to medical school.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.713
We're gonna add him
to your interns today.

01:19.780 --> 01:23.517
Fine, welcome to the team.
Blood pressure 50 over 80.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.354
White blood cell count elevated,
slight fever, what's the call?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.489
- Too soon to tell.
- God, you are good.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.658
I don't wanna interrupt
and you're our best.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.293
Isn't this clearly
a knife wound?

01:32.360 --> 01:34.162
Hey, suit, you stay
outta my way.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.264
Knife is a small piece
of the puzzle.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.499
We gotta figure out what's wrong
with this kid.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.134
Nidhi. Am I
pronouncing correctly?

01:40.201 --> 01:42.069
- It's Nidhi.
- I don't care.

01:42.136 --> 01:45.105
Interview everyone he's come in
contact with in last 40 days.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.807
'Go to his school.'

01:46.874 --> 01:49.510
You're telling me, outside of
being punctured by a knife

01:49.577 --> 01:51.479
Noah's had no unusual symptoms.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.247
'Go to the knife factory.'

01:53.314 --> 01:55.349
You're telling me,
he walked out of here

01:55.416 --> 01:58.252
with no sign
of anything wrong at all.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.722
No, I'm telling you, he had
a huge knife in his stomach.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.457
(Owen)
'Go to his mother's
hairstylist.'

02:03.524 --> 02:05.559
You're telling me
is it will cost more

02:05.626 --> 02:08.395
to get highlights than it will
to dye on my hair.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.631
'Blake, I want you to go
to the library.'

02:10.698 --> 02:13.267
'Get on the internet, find out
everything about young boys.'

02:13.334 --> 02:17.505
(Blake)
'I know just where to go.'

02:17.571 --> 02:19.373
Park, am I pronouncing
that correctly?

02:19.440 --> 02:21.542
- Yes.
- I want you with this kid.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.644
'I think he's got three
days to live.'

02:23.711 --> 02:25.713
- I'm gonna need four.
- You got it, mister.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.416
- Chet, this is your big moment.
- I'm on it.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.618
Aren't we gonna
take the knife out?

02:30.684 --> 02:33.020
Hey, you did not go
to medical school.

02:33.086 --> 02:36.424
And until you do,
you will take a chill pill.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.559
Everybody, know your
assignments, get it in here.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.528
Childrens Hospital on three,
one, two, three.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.130
(together)
Children's Hospital.

02:43.197 --> 02:48.168
(female over speaker)
'Attention, staff, cheetos and
hot crunchy snacks are cheesy.'

02:48.236 --> 02:50.404
(female narrator)
We're all like
worker bees here.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.240
Each of us running around
bringing honey

02:52.306 --> 02:53.841
from one place to another.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.076
Never really knowing
what the others are thinking

02:56.143 --> 02:57.478
or feeling or dreaming.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.447
Hospital really is
like a beehive.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.049
I'd say your hospital
is more like a prison.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.051
Bee hive is more poetic.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.086
Mm, he's cute.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.788
No way, he's gross.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.823
Do you have to disagree
with everything I..

03:09.890 --> 03:12.626
- Can you hear my thoughts?
- Yeah.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.563
- Wow, what an amazing gift.
- It's awful, actually.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.399
I can hear all the horrible
things people think of me.

03:18.466 --> 03:21.502
Gees, what a whiner.
Oops.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.571
* I heard you speak *

03:23.637 --> 03:25.839
* But I couldn't believe *

03:25.906 --> 03:27.875
[honking]

03:27.941 --> 03:31.144
* Now it's gone *

03:31.211 --> 03:33.247
* We're falling apart *

03:33.314 --> 03:35.616
* It feels wrong *

03:35.683 --> 03:38.486
* I wanna go back to the start *

03:38.552 --> 03:41.021
* The problem with romance is *

03:41.088 --> 03:43.156
* There are no second chances *

03:43.223 --> 03:45.293
[dramatic music]

03:46.694 --> 03:49.229
Wait a second, have
you been here this whole time?

03:49.297 --> 03:52.833
I've been spending many hours
in this hospital, Dr. Richie.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.936
- How do you know my name?
- 'I know a great many things.'

03:56.003 --> 03:58.472
For example, I understand
that you've discovered a cure

03:58.539 --> 04:02.610
for a certain here-to-fore
uncurable disease.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.346
Incurable, no such word
as "uncurable".

04:05.413 --> 04:06.947
Who are you, anyway?

04:07.014 --> 04:10.518
I represent an organization
that has a special request.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.987
Drop the cancer cure.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.323
Or else.,

04:15.389 --> 04:17.458
[music continues]

04:20.961 --> 04:23.864
Wait outside,
I wasn't listening, what?

04:27.234 --> 04:29.202
This information
is no good.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.472
Don't make me
let this kid die.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.107
Bet you guys 50 bucks
if I can guess your weight.

04:34.174 --> 04:37.578
- I bet you 50 bucks, you can't.
- What's up with that, Valerie.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.413
170.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.248
She got that
right on the nose.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.216
Halie here, can read minds,
everybody.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.319
(Owen)
So what are we thinking
right now?

04:45.386 --> 04:46.954
Frankfurters.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.188
The Allman brothers.

04:48.255 --> 04:49.523
Death.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.158
Also Frankfurters.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.528
Fascinating, you have
got a gift, young lady.

04:54.595 --> 04:58.198
Ugh! Would it kill you to
make a decent cup of coffee?

04:58.265 --> 04:59.567
(thinking)
What a whiner.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.670
(thinking)
I know, right.
Wait.

05:02.736 --> 05:06.039
Alright, listen, I've got
a patient, I need you to meet.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.408
Come on.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.478
I get the sense

05:10.544 --> 05:13.180
that I'm not quite getting
through to you, Dr. Richie.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.883
No, I heard you. You said
about stopping my research.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.652
- Or else.
- Then you said, or else, right.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.588
But I didn't say it like that.

05:20.654 --> 05:24.358
- Or else, I said it menacingly.
- Well..

05:24.425 --> 05:27.495
I mean if I'm being honest,
it didn't sound very menacing.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.230
That's because you
weren't paying attention.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.865
What did you say?
I'm sorry.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.502
You weren't paying attention.
You were playing with keyboard.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.136
I'm guilty.
Guilty, Your Honor.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.972
Now, do you think you can read
the mind of someone

05:39.039 --> 05:41.609
who's been in a coma
for about 40 years.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.911
I'll give it a try,
but it sounds boring.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.680
Why not, only you can get
the information from him.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.883
And only he can fill
in the blanks.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.085
Go get him, killer.

05:53.621 --> 05:56.757
[indistinct chatter]

06:00.794 --> 06:03.531
[indistinct chatter continues]

06:17.978 --> 06:19.413
Oh, hey.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.615
This might be
confusing for you

06:21.682 --> 06:23.851
but you've been in a coma
for 40 years.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.319
I am not really here.
I'm communicating with you

06:26.386 --> 06:27.588
via mental telepathy.

06:27.655 --> 06:30.223
Wow!
So many questions.

06:30.290 --> 06:33.393
Did they finish building that
World Trade Centre in New York?

06:33.461 --> 06:34.595
Well, yes.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.263
- Hot dog.
- But..

06:36.329 --> 06:37.498
How's it going in there?

06:37.565 --> 06:40.267
Mama Mia, those pricks.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.469
One more random thing.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.637
How did that challenger
flight go?

06:43.704 --> 06:46.874
Yeah, so they want me to ask
you some questions.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.276
Alright.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.011
Is Ana your primary carrier

06:51.078 --> 06:53.681
or are you being covered
by another plan?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.616
Gee, I really
don't know, I probably--

06:55.683 --> 06:57.184
Do you have any
other conditions--

06:57.250 --> 07:01.021
- I went into the coma--
- It's kinda important.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.693
[upbeat music]

07:17.471 --> 07:19.607
[sniffing]

07:23.744 --> 07:26.346
[music continues]

07:26.413 --> 07:27.981
[intense music]

07:29.783 --> 07:32.319
Let me get this straight.
You're trying to convince me

07:32.385 --> 07:35.589
to forget that I cured cancer
and allow countless people

07:35.656 --> 07:38.526
to die as a result.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.328
- Yes.
- Ah-h-h, in that case.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.897
No, thank you,
I'd rather just cure it.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.366
- You have a niece, Dr. Richie.
- Ha-ha, who doesn't.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.268
Does she live
in Charlotte, North Carolina

07:48.335 --> 07:49.903
on Fox Grove Court?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.573
2134, Fox Grove Court,
first bedroom on the right.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.608
She doesn't have
a lock on the door.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.109
What if something
happened to her?

07:56.176 --> 07:57.745
I'm not saying,
it's going to--

07:57.811 --> 08:00.447
Oh, good, one last thing
for me to worry about.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.415
And is your bank account 8..

08:02.482 --> 08:04.117
...9598292.

08:04.184 --> 08:07.387
But that's nothing, you should
hear my pin number, 2115--

08:07.454 --> 08:09.356
But what happened
if all the money

08:09.422 --> 08:12.425
just simply disappeared.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.027
You are like my ex-wife.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.096
Always worrying about something
that might happen.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.666
This might happen,
that might happen, ah-h-h.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.934
Three days and you guys
got nothing.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.071
Uh, I wouldn't call
these highlights, nothing.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.507
- Noah, do you have any pets?
- I have a fish.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.710
Do you know where
your fish is from?

08:29.777 --> 08:31.344
Just tell me the answer.

08:31.411 --> 08:34.447
He's a Ecuadorian Calico Fantail
from the Amazon river basin.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.586
A breeding ground for
a parasite, Hep-Leptospira.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.287
Alex.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.123
Take this to the lab,
cut his legs off, dissect him.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.458
'I'm willing to wager
that it's a carrier.'

08:45.525 --> 08:47.160
Fortunately for you,
young sportsman

08:47.227 --> 08:48.796
Leptospira isn't fatal.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.231
Couple of days bed rest.
You'll be up and running.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.234
See that everybody,
despite initial impressions

08:54.301 --> 08:57.470
Noah's medical problems
had nothing to do with this.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.406
(together)
Oh-h-h!

08:59.472 --> 09:01.374
Code blue,
he's going into a coma.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.010
Oh, is he?

09:03.076 --> 09:06.980
[clears throat]
I could be wrong
about all that other stuff.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.883
- Hey, where are you taking me?
- I'll give you a hint.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.919
It's the most
important thing to you.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.087
Are you taking me
to my dog, Sadie?

09:14.154 --> 09:16.790
Okay, what's the second most
important thing in the world?

09:16.857 --> 09:19.092
Well, my personal relationship
with G-O-D.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.661
- Third?
- My classmate Andre.

09:20.728 --> 09:21.995
- Fourth.
- Banana bread.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.597
- Fifth.
- Billy Barty's finger tips.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.098
- Sixth.
- Uh-h-h..

09:25.165 --> 09:27.768
- Ah, that's it, come on.
- Banana bread.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.639
Oh, my God.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.974
They finally
trimmed the bushes.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.709
Not the bushes,
you idiot.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.712
The car, your car,
it's gone, see.

09:38.779 --> 09:42.282
Oh, right, shit.
Uh, well, you know what.

09:42.349 --> 09:45.352
My lease is up next week
anyways, so no biggie.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.354
No big..
Wait a minute.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.091
Hey, I could be totally
reading into this wrong, but..

09:51.158 --> 09:54.928
I feel like you stole my car
to get me to cooperate with you.

09:54.995 --> 09:58.365
My organization has a very large
stake in the revenues

09:58.431 --> 10:00.167
from cancer treatment.

10:00.233 --> 10:03.804
A cure...is not
in our best interests.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.506
Don't mess with us.

10:06.573 --> 10:10.210
Wait a minute, who do you work
for, how can I get in touch?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.612
We'll get in touch
with you, Dr. Richie.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.948
You don't need to know
who we are.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.955
[dramatic music]

10:23.857 --> 10:26.326
(Dr. Richie)
'Wait, the car is gone.'

10:32.365 --> 10:35.002
[instrumental music]

10:42.710 --> 10:46.279
You went to a coma when
Dr. Maestro pulled the knife.

10:46.346 --> 10:49.216
By the way, how does
a ten-year-old get a job

10:49.282 --> 10:51.051
in a knife factory?

10:51.118 --> 10:52.185
I don't know.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.788
That definitely
it does not make sense.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.126
(female over speaker)
'Attention,
what is the difference'

10:59.192 --> 11:02.395
'between a friend
and having nobody to talk to.'

11:02.462 --> 11:04.131
'Everything.'
